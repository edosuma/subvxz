01:22.280 --> 01:29.350
If this rope breaks, we can
buy a new one at Busan Port

01:29.750 --> 01:39.330
If our breaks, we can make a new
one's from the trees of Halla Mountain

01:39.390 --> 01:43.400
Row the boat
Let's go to leodo

01:43.460 --> 01:47.710
Let's fight our way
through the waves

01:47.770 --> 01:49.810
Row the boat
Let's go to leodo

01:49.870 --> 01:53.220
Let's fight our way
through the waves

02:16.600 --> 02:19.540
Grandma, be careful!

02:19.930 --> 02:23.380
I'm jealous of you for having
such a sweet grandchild!

02:26.610 --> 02:28.550
It's Mr. Dolphin!

02:28.940 --> 02:35.420
Mr. Dolphin, please tell my dad
that I, Hye-ji is doing fine!

02:42.390 --> 02:43.330
Grandma!

02:43.390 --> 02:46.400
Which is bigger,
the sea or the sky?

02:49.130 --> 02:50.770
The sea is bigger.

02:50.830 --> 02:53.940
Have you been to
the end of both?

02:56.870 --> 02:58.540
No, but I know the answer.

02:58.970 --> 03:00.480
How do you know?

03:01.640 --> 03:03.520
As you grow old...

03:05.910 --> 03:08.480
You learn these things naturally.

03:13.520 --> 03:16.700
Can I go out
into the sea, too?

03:16.760 --> 03:18.830
Of course.
Let's go together.

03:19.360 --> 03:21.400
Wow, really?

03:21.760 --> 03:23.300
True.

03:25.400 --> 03:30.470
<i>Grandma Gye-chun</i>

03:35.410 --> 03:37.650
Grandma, I'm scared!

03:39.950 --> 03:41.930
Grandma!

03:42.380 --> 03:44.800
Grandma, I'm scared!

03:44.850 --> 03:48.390
Hye-ji, why didn't you
wake me up?

03:48.460 --> 03:49.870
I'll scare him off.

03:49.920 --> 03:51.730
Get away from there!

03:51.730 --> 03:54.140
- Toya, go away!
- Go away!

03:54.200 --> 03:55.700
Toya, go away!

03:55.760 --> 03:58.710
- Come here.
- Grandma, I'm scared!

03:59.430 --> 04:01.880
Go to sleep...

04:03.700 --> 04:09.590
If you need to poop, wake me
up or use the chamber pot.

04:09.640 --> 04:11.890
Don't go to the
outhouse by yourself.

04:12.680 --> 04:15.590
I thought Toya was asleep.

04:16.820 --> 04:17.890
Did you?

04:20.660 --> 04:23.470
You should just eat that pig!

04:23.520 --> 04:25.600
Don't eat him!

04:27.930 --> 04:29.370
Baekgu!

04:30.830 --> 04:31.780
Hi, Baekgu.

04:31.930 --> 04:35.970
<i>Seek-ho, come on out'.!</i>

04:38.770 --> 04:41.150
Mrs. Hong...

04:41.940 --> 04:44.890
It's not even 6 a.m.!

04:45.210 --> 04:47.180
Don't glare at me with
your round eyes!

04:47.180 --> 04:50.750
Would you prefer
triangle eyes, then?

04:57.960 --> 04:58.940
Hye-ji.

05:00.460 --> 05:02.410
- Play with this.
- Thank you.

05:04.900 --> 05:05.840
Honey...

05:08.870 --> 05:11.370
- Wait here
- Okay.

05:23.620 --> 05:28.660
Grandma, did you catch a lot?

05:28.790 --> 05:32.200
It's time to head back!

05:42.940 --> 05:43.780
Oh!

05:44.640 --> 05:46.350
What's going on?

05:52.750 --> 05:56.460
I'll be right back, sweetie.

05:57.220 --> 05:58.290
This...

06:01.790 --> 06:02.860
Grandma?

06:03.090 --> 06:08.400
I got you!
Damn thing.

06:08.460 --> 06:11.810
Oh my. Come in.

06:11.900 --> 06:15.680
- Grandma!
- Huh?

06:15.740 --> 06:16.710
Hye-ji, I'm right here!

06:16.770 --> 06:18.840
Where are you?

06:18.910 --> 06:21.650
Oh, sweetie...

06:21.710 --> 06:23.910
Were you scared?

06:23.910 --> 06:25.890
Stationery store

06:26.450 --> 06:28.430
What is it?

06:28.920 --> 06:30.880
All right, hold still.

06:30.890 --> 06:33.090
All right, all right.
Why are you doing this?

06:37.890 --> 06:39.570
Hye-ji...

06:39.630 --> 06:42.200
I'll buy it for you later.

06:42.260 --> 06:43.860
I want it now.

06:43.860 --> 06:46.940
Don't touch it if you're
not going to buy it.

06:47.300 --> 06:49.940
- How much is it?
- 6000 won.

06:49.940 --> 06:53.580
It only costs 6000 won,
so don't be so pretty!

06:55.880 --> 06:59.320
That's worth more than 6000 won,
but keep the change.

06:59.580 --> 07:01.560
Hye-ji, let's go.

07:01.620 --> 07:04.100
- Goodbye.
- Eels are expensive...

07:05.890 --> 07:07.160
Thank you!

07:08.560 --> 07:10.300
This will make me virile!

07:12.790 --> 07:15.500
Toya!

07:16.900 --> 07:20.610
Look at my new crayons!
Cool, isn't it?

07:23.240 --> 07:24.180
Hmph.

07:34.280 --> 07:36.760
I should have bought
it for her sooner.

07:43.220 --> 07:44.600
Hye-ji!

07:45.360 --> 07:47.240
I'm right here!

07:47.290 --> 07:49.140
This is our family!

07:49.900 --> 07:53.570
You, me and Toya.

08:05.350 --> 08:08.990
I have gold tooth right here!

08:09.050 --> 08:11.160
The gold crayon is
only for grandma.

08:11.220 --> 08:14.890
This gold tooth is
my best feature!

08:14.890 --> 08:17.130
Please color it gold!

08:17.190 --> 08:18.640
No!

08:18.690 --> 08:19.640
Then...

08:20.290 --> 08:23.710
I'll give you 500 won
to color it gold.

08:24.700 --> 08:26.180
Here's 500 won.

08:27.670 --> 08:28.770
Thank you!

08:28.840 --> 08:31.540
So, make it gold.

08:33.340 --> 08:34.840
I still can't.

08:35.710 --> 08:38.880
Then, give me my
500 won back.

08:39.110 --> 08:41.890
Hye-ji, stop right there!

08:45.720 --> 08:48.920
Are you going to see
your dad today?

08:48.920 --> 08:49.900
Yes.

08:51.360 --> 08:53.460
Does that make you happy?

08:53.690 --> 08:54.900
Yes, it does!

08:55.700 --> 08:57.570
Dad, eat this.

09:08.240 --> 09:13.240
Everyone wants me to draw
them because I'm so talented!

09:14.880 --> 09:16.880
I will draw grandma first

09:16.880 --> 09:19.390
and then you.

09:19.890 --> 09:21.160
Hye-ji!

09:24.090 --> 09:26.330
Dad, see you!

09:33.200 --> 09:34.200
Let's go to bed.

09:34.900 --> 09:39.110
Can't I finish coloring your hair?

09:39.170 --> 09:43.850
We have to wake up early to
fly to a wedding tomorrow.

09:43.910 --> 09:45.290
Let's sleep.

09:50.450 --> 09:54.920
Sleep closer to me
so you won't get cold.

09:54.920 --> 09:57.900
My grandchild is already
making my life easier.

10:03.560 --> 10:06.140
Grandma, What's a wedding?

10:06.600 --> 10:08.100
A wedding is...

10:10.500 --> 10:13.450
A man and woman
becoming partners.

10:13.940 --> 10:16.420
What about my dad's partner?

10:18.380 --> 10:20.190
Do you miss your mom?

10:20.250 --> 10:22.920
No, I have you.

10:35.160 --> 10:38.270
Take advantage of today's sale!

10:38.330 --> 10:39.570
Take your time.

10:39.830 --> 10:40.970
How much is that?

10:40.970 --> 10:43.510
- 5000 won.
- It's expensive.

10:43.570 --> 10:45.950
Oh the little girl knows
that's my shop as well.

10:46.310 --> 10:47.380
Grandma!

10:47.440 --> 10:49.390
It's so pretty,
I want it!

10:49.440 --> 10:50.980
- Come here.
- Get over here.

10:50.980 --> 10:54.890
I'll sell you those two
pieces at 6000 won.

10:55.980 --> 10:58.360
Let me see.
It's very pretty.

11:28.820 --> 11:29.890
Hye-ji.

11:34.260 --> 11:35.560
Hye-ji!

12:13.330 --> 12:16.170
Hye-ji!

12:20.630 --> 12:23.140
Hye-ji!

12:24.940 --> 12:28.890
<i>12 years later</i>

12:33.580 --> 12:35.560
- Excuse me.
- Yes?

12:36.350 --> 12:38.490
- How may I help you?
- Is this any good?

12:38.550 --> 12:41.260
It's a great foundation.

12:44.690 --> 12:48.300
- How much is this?
- 32000 won.

12:48.360 --> 12:49.710
It's not that expensive.

12:51.230 --> 12:52.300
Please look around.

12:52.370 --> 12:53.970
Hye-ji, let's go.

12:53.970 --> 12:56.240
Thank you, come again.

13:01.380 --> 13:02.410
Hey, are you crazy?

13:02.480 --> 13:03.450
Give it back!

13:03.510 --> 13:05.110
You are crazy!

13:05.280 --> 13:06.780
What did you steal?

13:09.180 --> 13:10.890
I'm killing you.

13:11.220 --> 13:13.220
They cut off our electricity.

13:14.920 --> 13:16.530
It's so cold,
I can see my breath.

13:17.390 --> 13:20.130
You should steal
more valuable stuff.

13:20.590 --> 13:21.830
I'm starving.

13:22.530 --> 13:24.740
I'm not going to lend
you any of these!

13:26.930 --> 13:28.870
You should just
get another eye.

13:28.870 --> 13:33.840
I'm 800 thousand won
away from a nose job.

13:33.840 --> 13:38.260
Don't spread embarrassing pictures
of me when I become an idol star.

13:40.880 --> 13:44.490
Don't use my precious
makeup to draw pictures!

13:46.590 --> 13:48.930
Get back to making
your eyes pretty.

13:49.460 --> 13:52.200
Okay, I will.

13:52.360 --> 13:57.830
What the hell is it?
Picture? Picasso?

13:58.130 --> 14:00.410
Why are they laughing so loud?

14:06.610 --> 14:07.640
Were you talking about me?

14:07.710 --> 14:08.520
No.

14:08.910 --> 14:11.250
Let's go eat something.

14:11.310 --> 14:13.850
- Hurry up.
- Close the window.

14:23.890 --> 14:26.840
- 'What will you wear?'
- Let's say 'I'll go naked.'

14:26.890 --> 14:28.740
- That's too much.
- 'I'll be naked.'

14:29.200 --> 14:31.570
How ridiculous.
He liked that joke.

14:32.500 --> 14:33.770
We got him.

14:34.570 --> 14:35.770
Tonight at 11 o'clock.

14:37.570 --> 14:40.480
Go pretend to be an prostitute.

14:40.610 --> 14:41.550
Me?

14:42.710 --> 14:45.450
That's too scary.

14:50.850 --> 14:51.660
Hey

14:52.850 --> 14:53.800
Hey

14:54.620 --> 14:56.500
What is it that you do?

14:56.560 --> 14:58.830
All you do is eat food!

14:58.930 --> 15:00.030
Surely you have the drug, right?

15:00.090 --> 15:01.200
Stop it.

15:03.630 --> 15:06.630
- I'll do it.
- Hye-ji, don't.

15:07.300 --> 15:08.910
Oh, Hye-ji!

15:11.970 --> 15:13.470
It's only pretending, right?

15:16.310 --> 15:18.310
I should sell my stocks.

15:20.550 --> 15:22.190
It's open.

15:25.250 --> 15:26.290
Lock the door.

15:31.590 --> 15:32.300
Well...

15:33.060 --> 15:34.970
You want mango juice?

15:51.350 --> 15:52.410
<i>Room 204</i>

15:52.410 --> 15:54.150
Good, great.

15:56.550 --> 15:57.690
Aren't you going to
take a shower?

15:58.420 --> 16:00.330
I can't be bothered.

16:01.760 --> 16:03.290
Hey, hey!

16:09.300 --> 16:12.400
Don't be like that.

16:13.800 --> 16:14.570
Come on, sit back down.

16:19.170 --> 16:20.310
I'll go shower.

17:00.650 --> 17:02.090
What were you doing?

17:05.150 --> 17:07.500
- Go shower.
- Okay.

17:11.020 --> 17:12.440
Aren't you taking
your clothes off?

17:14.430 --> 17:16.740
I'll take them off
in the shower.

17:36.420 --> 17:37.620
- There he is.
- What the hell?

17:37.680 --> 17:39.220
- Take the picture!
- Who are you?

17:39.290 --> 17:40.770
Knock it off, I'm warning you!

17:40.820 --> 17:42.770
- You're looking good!
- Knock it off!

17:44.220 --> 17:46.600
Why are you so scrawny?

17:46.660 --> 17:47.330
Huh?

17:47.430 --> 17:50.310
You're working
these pimps?

17:52.270 --> 17:54.750
- Pimps, you say?
- We're her brothers.

17:54.800 --> 17:56.970
You think you can fight
your way out of this?

17:57.270 --> 17:58.110
Huh?

17:58.510 --> 18:01.320
You were just caught
with a minor.

18:01.740 --> 18:02.550
What do you want?

18:02.610 --> 18:03.610
10 million won.

18:03.680 --> 18:05.680
Are you crazy?

18:05.780 --> 18:09.060
If you won't pay up we'll send
these photos to your wife

18:09.150 --> 18:12.360
and your colleagues and friends.

18:13.620 --> 18:14.760
Wrap it up!

18:17.390 --> 18:18.560
Mister.

18:18.830 --> 18:20.770
I'm going easy on you.

18:21.230 --> 18:22.400
What's the password?

18:23.800 --> 18:24.640
Hm?

18:25.870 --> 18:27.780
Damn it!

18:28.140 --> 18:29.710
- What are you doing?
- Ouch!

18:29.770 --> 18:32.380
- What the hell?
- Get off!

18:32.440 --> 18:33.850
Son of a bitch!

18:33.910 --> 18:35.910
Damn it!

18:37.510 --> 18:38.220
Hey!

18:38.880 --> 18:41.360
- Come here, come here.
- Burglar!

18:42.750 --> 18:44.850
- Stop it!
- Son of a bitch!

18:45.250 --> 18:45.790
Hey!

18:45.850 --> 18:47.800
- Dumbass!
- Douchebag!

18:47.850 --> 18:50.430
- Trying to sleep with a minor!
- Enough!

18:50.490 --> 18:52.900
You don't know
when to stop, do you?

18:59.670 --> 19:02.870
Why did you
stomp on him so hard?

19:02.870 --> 19:04.610
You hit first.

19:11.450 --> 19:14.480
It's nothing.
He can't call the cops anyway.

19:14.550 --> 19:15.750
It's the motel owner
we should be worried about.

19:15.820 --> 19:16.660
Dude.

19:17.380 --> 19:19.160
What if he's dead?

19:21.490 --> 19:22.660
Shut up!

19:23.690 --> 19:25.140
You said he fell on his own.

19:25.360 --> 19:26.800
- Let's just go to the police...
- Min-hee.

19:26.860 --> 19:28.700
If you don't keep your mouth shut

19:28.760 --> 19:30.230
we're all dead.

19:30.230 --> 19:31.500
Fine.

19:31.570 --> 19:32.640
I won't say anything-

19:35.700 --> 19:36.810
Give me your phone.

19:37.240 --> 19:38.880
I'll get rid of it,
along with his.

19:41.240 --> 19:45.090
We should scatter for a while
and contact each other later.

19:53.720 --> 19:55.530
Why are you out in the cold?

19:55.590 --> 19:57.900
Go someplace else.

20:07.230 --> 20:09.270
I'm back.

20:10.300 --> 20:12.750
Where have you been?

20:15.740 --> 20:17.520
I didn't steal these.

20:18.280 --> 20:22.250
I dipped into my
emergency savings fund.

20:25.320 --> 20:26.320
Thanks.

20:27.290 --> 20:30.290
It's not much, but
let's not lose dignity.

20:31.560 --> 20:35.290
Should we use steak knives?

20:35.300 --> 20:37.540
- That's not funny.
- Should we grill this?

20:37.600 --> 20:38.300
Just eat.

20:41.800 --> 20:45.880
Look, you and this girl
have the same name.

20:47.210 --> 20:49.210
But her last name isn't Cha.

20:59.350 --> 21:02.250
<i>Missing child
Lee Hye-ji</i>

21:02.260 --> 21:03.730
Hurry up and drink.

21:07.860 --> 21:09.640
I'll drink it later.

21:11.930 --> 21:13.280
I'm not thirsty.

21:47.730 --> 21:52.150
I find you guys so easily.

21:55.340 --> 21:59.290
But I may not find
her in this lifetime.

22:26.210 --> 22:31.210
<i>Missing child
Lee Hye-ji</i>

22:35.450 --> 22:37.590
Ma'am!

22:37.880 --> 22:38.890
I'm here.

22:43.190 --> 22:45.330
Look at this house!

22:45.390 --> 22:47.240
Cassettes, matches...

22:47.830 --> 22:49.400
They're all antiques!

22:49.560 --> 22:52.410
This place is such a mess...

22:53.200 --> 22:56.670
It already looks
like moving day.

22:58.310 --> 23:02.250
A Chinese guy wants
to buy this house.

23:03.110 --> 23:05.240
I'll get you 4 times
of what it's worth!

23:05.250 --> 23:06.220
4 times!

23:07.610 --> 23:10.250
What if your granddaughter returns?

23:10.250 --> 23:12.130
She'll be so shocked!

23:13.250 --> 23:16.390
I'm not selling my house,
so don't come again!

23:18.830 --> 23:19.630
Oops...

23:21.330 --> 23:23.100
It's so salty.

23:24.830 --> 23:29.180
I guess your kidneys
are still healthy.

23:29.240 --> 23:31.770
She still has a temper, too.

23:31.840 --> 23:37.410
She said she won't sell
the house, so give up.

23:38.180 --> 23:39.750
Let's go catch the boat.

23:40.350 --> 23:44.390
I'm heading home, everyone!

23:44.450 --> 23:49.200
You're only strong
inside the water.

23:49.920 --> 23:52.530
You're being too stubborn.

23:53.230 --> 23:54.900
Think of your age.

23:55.460 --> 23:59.270
Sell the house and use
the money to live comfortably.

23:59.370 --> 24:04.480
Then, where would
Hye-ji come back to?

24:06.240 --> 24:08.690
She hasn't come back
to that house for years.

24:10.710 --> 24:13.210
Look, it's the dolphins...

24:13.910 --> 24:20.690
Dolphins, please make
my wish come true.

24:20.750 --> 24:22.860
If dolphins granted wishes...

24:24.260 --> 24:25.900
I'd own a building.

24:28.260 --> 24:29.240
Thank you.

24:34.200 --> 24:36.240
When Hye-ji was young,
her mother ran off.

24:37.300 --> 24:40.310
And her father died
when she was a baby.

24:40.370 --> 24:42.320
Now, we don't know
if she's alive or dead.

24:43.410 --> 24:48.280
It's because
we're both unlucky.

24:48.280 --> 24:49.390
Don't say that.

24:49.650 --> 24:50.460
What?

24:50.720 --> 24:53.890
You have me and Myung-ok.

25:01.390 --> 25:04.310
Speak of the devil.

25:05.600 --> 25:07.770
What is it?

25:11.470 --> 25:12.470
Really?

25:15.240 --> 25:16.520
Are you sure?

25:18.340 --> 25:19.220
Okay!

25:19.980 --> 25:21.050
Ma'am!

25:21.510 --> 25:24.590
The dolphins granted your wish!

25:25.820 --> 25:26.520
Huh?

25:30.160 --> 25:31.920
Where is she?

25:31.930 --> 25:35.430
We brought Mrs. Hong...

25:35.500 --> 25:37.300
Over here, please.

25:37.500 --> 25:40.770
I'm Hong Gye-chun.
Where's my grandchild?

25:40.830 --> 25:42.940
The person in charge
is waiting for you.

25:43.000 --> 25:45.740
- We'll have to check...
- What?

25:45.810 --> 25:48.880
- If she's really your relative.
- Where is she?

25:48.980 --> 25:50.390
Are you Mrs. Hong?

25:50.740 --> 25:51.750
Follow me.

25:51.810 --> 25:53.310
Please read thoroughly

25:53.380 --> 25:55.760
and fill out the DNA test
application form.

25:56.880 --> 26:00.130
Was her mother's name
Park Soo-hee?

26:00.190 --> 26:03.760
Yes, that's my daughter-in-law.

26:03.820 --> 26:06.700
She kidnapped Nam Hye-ji...

26:06.760 --> 26:07.670
What?

26:08.660 --> 26:10.470
Well, she took her.

26:10.530 --> 26:14.500
Right after Hye-ji disappeared,
she was registered to her family.

26:14.600 --> 26:19.140
But it says here that
Park Soo-hee is dead.

26:19.210 --> 26:21.780
According to Hye-ji,
it was a car crash.

26:21.840 --> 26:26.190
Her stepfather gave up custody,
so she went to an orphanage.

26:26.280 --> 26:31.160
We searched the entire country
without knowing that!

26:31.220 --> 26:35.170
Please write your name
and leave a thumbprint.

26:35.220 --> 26:36.170
Here you go.

26:36.220 --> 26:40.260
We can't thank you enough.

26:40.260 --> 26:41.260
Not at all.

26:41.360 --> 26:44.270
- Thank you so much.
- Just wait for a while.

26:44.460 --> 26:45.500
Are you done?

26:45.570 --> 26:48.640
Leave that off at the clinic.

26:48.700 --> 26:51.380
- Okay, thank you.
- Please wait here.

26:54.270 --> 26:57.410
- Should we throw a party?
- Of course we should.

27:00.710 --> 27:02.620
Sorry to keep you waiting.

27:02.850 --> 27:04.160
Come on in.

27:23.740 --> 27:25.040
Hello.

27:41.390 --> 27:44.130
Are you really Hye-ji?

27:48.900 --> 27:50.900
You're grown so much.

27:55.240 --> 27:58.310
Look at that face.

28:06.180 --> 28:07.590
You still have this...

28:12.190 --> 28:15.630
Why didn't you look for me?

28:17.460 --> 28:21.300
Mom said that you died.

28:25.300 --> 28:29.340
You must have
struggled so much.

28:32.910 --> 28:36.380
My baby...
My grandchild...

28:40.880 --> 28:42.380
Everything's fine now.

28:43.280 --> 28:47.660
I found you.
You're alive.

28:52.260 --> 28:54.430
Let's take a picture.

28:54.590 --> 28:55.440
Come to the center.

28:55.560 --> 28:57.840
Shouldn't we be
in the picture, too?

28:57.960 --> 28:58.870
No!

28:58.930 --> 29:00.100
More to the right.

29:00.170 --> 29:01.510
No no, that way

29:01.570 --> 29:02.810
to the other side.

29:05.170 --> 29:06.840
- Smile.
- I'll take the picture.

29:07.270 --> 29:08.620
Three, two, one!

29:09.640 --> 29:13.060
This house feels cozy
now that Hye-ji's back.

29:14.410 --> 29:16.390
Let's invite the neighbors.

29:16.450 --> 29:20.260
It's been ages since
I've you smile!

29:20.320 --> 29:23.530
Why are you preparing
dinner so early?

29:23.590 --> 29:29.100
Hye-ji your grandma is
cooking tilefish for you!

29:29.200 --> 29:30.230
Go away.

29:31.200 --> 29:32.200
0w!

29:32.670 --> 29:35.580
- I want to help.
- No, no.

29:35.640 --> 29:38.480
Get inside, sweetie.

29:38.540 --> 29:39.740
Go in, some rest.

29:42.240 --> 29:44.190
Look at that smile!

29:44.240 --> 29:45.480
Are you that happy?

29:48.480 --> 29:51.360
Your wish came true!

29:51.420 --> 29:54.230
- You're right.
- Hye-ji came back.

29:54.290 --> 29:57.260
The Sea God must really exist!

29:57.260 --> 29:59.290
Of course he does.

30:01.230 --> 30:02.500
This proves it.

30:02.930 --> 30:06.240
I think the Sea God
must really exist.

30:18.380 --> 30:21.360
Did you still have that?

30:23.250 --> 30:25.560
- Here, eat this.
- Thank you.

30:28.290 --> 30:30.820
I let go of your hand.

30:31.760 --> 30:34.360
I wanted to buy
nice things for you.

30:35.560 --> 30:38.410
But I got carried away.

30:40.600 --> 30:44.670
From now on, we'll be happy.

30:47.840 --> 30:52.760
Let's all drink up to
celebrate Hye-ji's return!

30:52.810 --> 30:57.660
Mrs. Hong suffered so
much for all these years!

30:57.820 --> 31:00.160
You can't even tell that
she's an elderly!

31:00.290 --> 31:02.160
That's right.

31:02.220 --> 31:07.470
Mrs. Hong will finally be
able to sleep well!

31:07.530 --> 31:08.600
You're right.

31:09.460 --> 31:12.770
I can't believe this
day is finally here.

31:13.230 --> 31:18.200
She looks just like
her grandma!

31:20.240 --> 31:22.220
Look at her eat!

31:22.440 --> 31:23.610
Is it good?

31:25.240 --> 31:26.720
You should eat, too.

31:26.780 --> 31:28.620
She's the same age as Han!

31:28.680 --> 31:30.820
You used to play together.

31:30.880 --> 31:33.920
You should be in high school!

31:34.290 --> 31:35.600
Stop running around!

31:37.260 --> 31:45.230
Do you remember the black pig
that lived near the outhouse?

31:46.300 --> 31:47.900
- Toya_
- Toya!

31:50.270 --> 31:51.770
She remembers Toya!

31:51.840 --> 31:56.220
- This is all so sad.
- Don't be sad!

31:56.280 --> 31:57.690
Hey-ji. Hey-ji!

31:58.440 --> 32:01.480
Ma'am, where's Hye-ji?

32:01.550 --> 32:04.650
Hye-ji, I waited so
long for you to return!

32:04.720 --> 32:08.860
Weren't you shocked at
the sight of this house?

32:08.920 --> 32:10.660
- Just sell it...
- Stop it!

32:10.720 --> 32:12.630
She's just arrived!

32:12.690 --> 32:15.300
Don't bring the house up!

32:15.360 --> 32:16.670
Just drink up and leave.

32:16.730 --> 32:19.540
Don't be like that.
Here, drink this.

32:20.700 --> 32:21.700
Ma'am...

32:21.770 --> 32:23.870
Let's all drink together!

32:24.500 --> 32:27.920
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

32:48.430 --> 32:49.410
Oh!

33:14.690 --> 33:15.690
Are you pooping?

33:16.260 --> 33:18.530
You should have
woken me up.

33:21.430 --> 33:25.170
Let's buy a toilet
tomorrow morning!

33:44.680 --> 33:47.100
I washed your clothes,
so just wear that.

33:47.550 --> 33:49.660
Let's go someplace
after having breakfast.

33:49.720 --> 33:51.400
In these clothes?

33:51.660 --> 33:53.730
You look great!

33:59.400 --> 34:01.540
What do you think of this one?

34:01.600 --> 34:03.600
This comforter is thinner.

34:05.870 --> 34:07.350
I'll pack this one.

34:09.610 --> 34:10.949
It's for my granddaughter.

34:12.250 --> 34:13.590
She doesn't like it.

34:25.560 --> 34:27.370
Try this.

34:30.199 --> 34:32.230
This one's pretty.
You look like a doll!

34:35.330 --> 34:36.239
You like it?

35:11.270 --> 35:17.550
The guy didn't die, but
the motel owner wants money.

35:17.680 --> 35:18.750
Money?

35:18.810 --> 35:21.550
Or he'll tell the police.

35:22.180 --> 35:25.720
Chul-heon and Chung-hee
are trying to frame you.

35:26.320 --> 35:30.530
So, just stay there.

35:30.590 --> 35:33.400
- I'm out of coins.
- call me again!

35:44.140 --> 35:46.310
Don't step on that!

35:46.370 --> 35:50.820
Can't you see the ground?
Everything will be ruined!

35:51.340 --> 35:53.590
Get away from here!
Don't step on it!

35:53.650 --> 35:56.220
- Hello, ma'am.
- Oh, it's you.

35:56.350 --> 35:58.490
Han, how have you been?

36:01.420 --> 36:05.100
Take her away, or she'll
step on everything!

36:06.360 --> 36:07.570
You can't go this way.

36:07.630 --> 36:09.700
Do you not understand
what I am saying?

36:11.600 --> 36:13.240
- I'll be off.
- Good bye.

36:22.210 --> 36:24.620
You're Hye-ji, right?

36:26.450 --> 36:27.580
Do you know me?

36:28.750 --> 36:31.520
Everyone in this town knows you.

36:32.150 --> 36:33.220
I'm Han.

36:35.690 --> 36:37.860
Stop bothering me
and go your way.

36:41.260 --> 36:42.260
Want a ride home?

37:19.430 --> 37:20.840
What's that sound?

37:22.540 --> 37:24.170
The divers are gasping for air.

37:24.470 --> 37:26.180
Your grandmother
will be there, too.

37:26.810 --> 37:28.010
Gasping for air?

37:28.670 --> 37:29.680
Yeah.

37:29.780 --> 37:33.590
They hold their breath
for a really long time.

37:34.310 --> 37:36.850
We'd probably die.

37:46.830 --> 37:48.930
Why won't this open?

37:49.360 --> 37:50.840
I'm taking a bath.

37:50.900 --> 37:52.710
I know, but...

37:52.770 --> 37:54.180
Why won't this door open?

37:54.230 --> 37:56.180
I'm taking a bath!

37:56.240 --> 37:58.180
I know, I'm not deaf!

37:58.240 --> 37:59.810
Is the door broken?

38:01.170 --> 38:04.780
- I locked the door.
- Why did you do that?

38:04.840 --> 38:07.650
Open it so I can
get the dishes.

38:09.350 --> 38:10.420
Hold on.

38:14.290 --> 38:21.170
You don't need to lock
the door when you bathe.

38:24.560 --> 38:26.870
You're all grown up, huh?

38:36.840 --> 38:38.820
We have a new student.

38:40.210 --> 38:41.560
Introduce yourself.

38:44.250 --> 38:46.630
I haven't been to
school in a while.

38:47.290 --> 38:49.290
Don't give me any trouble.

38:51.560 --> 38:52.870
I'll take any empty seat.

38:59.970 --> 39:02.140
Don't bully the new kid, okay?

39:02.200 --> 39:04.680
- Yes, sir.
- I'll be watching you.

39:04.840 --> 39:05.650
Yes, sir.

39:08.370 --> 39:10.680
- Change seats with me.
- Why?

39:10.740 --> 39:13.160
- I'll buy you a snack.
- Okay.

39:19.320 --> 39:20.730
Do you have the textbook?

39:23.220 --> 39:27.330
Hye-ji is a full-grown lady now!

39:28.390 --> 39:32.140
I still see her as a child.

39:32.700 --> 39:35.680
But all I do now is
prepare her meals.

39:36.870 --> 39:40.540
At your age, you shouldn't
be changing diapers.

39:40.670 --> 39:41.740
Oh, right.

39:42.470 --> 39:44.350
Who's Hye-ji's art teacher?

39:44.410 --> 39:47.720
He's a well-known artist.

39:48.810 --> 39:52.130
He doesn't really
look like one.

39:52.220 --> 39:53.160
Huh?

39:53.220 --> 39:55.200
Free topic

39:56.920 --> 39:57.990
Here.

39:58.590 --> 40:02.840
Draw whatever you
want to today.

40:02.930 --> 40:03.930
Yes, sir.

40:04.200 --> 40:05.370
Stan!

40:19.350 --> 40:20.380
What's this?

40:22.650 --> 40:25.790
Have you expressed the
beauty of empty space?

40:25.850 --> 40:28.200
Or your free spirit?

40:28.250 --> 40:29.790
I didn't know what to draw.

40:29.860 --> 40:34.200
Draw anything
that come to your mind.

40:34.290 --> 40:35.570
Is that so hard?

40:38.700 --> 40:39.900
Do you want me out?

40:53.510 --> 40:54.490
Lee Hye-ji.

40:56.580 --> 41:02.330
I'll give you all
the time you need.

41:02.820 --> 41:08.170
You can't leave until
you've finished your picture.

41:09.330 --> 41:10.200
Stan drawing.

41:25.380 --> 41:26.650
Lee Hye-ji.

41:29.180 --> 41:31.660
You're really stubborn.

41:31.720 --> 41:33.360
Just go home, then.

41:34.250 --> 41:38.200
Why did she have to come here?

41:38.260 --> 41:39.200
You!

41:39.260 --> 41:40.240
Go home!

42:16.330 --> 42:18.870
Why are you still here?

42:22.800 --> 42:24.140
I'm done.

42:24.740 --> 42:25.810
Happy?

42:30.510 --> 42:31.450
Hye-ji!

42:48.260 --> 42:49.800
That girl...

43:07.380 --> 43:11.350
Why hasn't she
come home yet?

43:11.420 --> 43:12.390
Hye-ji!

43:12.450 --> 43:13.520
Your grandma.

43:15.950 --> 43:17.260
Hye-ji!

43:17.620 --> 43:19.330
I'm home.

43:19.560 --> 43:21.400
Did you study hard?

43:22.260 --> 43:23.260
Where's your backpack?

43:24.230 --> 43:27.210
- I left it at school.
- It's alright.

43:28.700 --> 43:31.480
You might as well.
It's so heavy.

43:31.640 --> 43:33.170
You're going back
tomorrow anyway.

43:33.240 --> 43:34.310
Let's eat dinner.

43:35.240 --> 43:36.740
You must be hungry.

43:39.950 --> 43:41.250
Come on out!

43:41.780 --> 43:42.690
Okay.-

43:46.750 --> 43:49.600
Eat up.

43:51.290 --> 43:52.360
Oh, dear...

43:58.600 --> 43:59.470
Hold on.

44:06.240 --> 44:07.650
I'll eat it myself.

44:07.710 --> 44:09.210
No. go ahead.

44:10.280 --> 44:11.280
Go on.

44:13.350 --> 44:14.950
That's it.

44:37.200 --> 44:38.180
To the right!

44:39.270 --> 44:40.610
Rotate your arms!

44:40.710 --> 44:42.520
That's it!

44:42.770 --> 44:46.950
Make waves with your arms!

44:47.210 --> 44:52.560
Will Hye-ji be more comfortable
if moved to an apartment?

44:52.650 --> 44:55.690
She's all you ever think about.

44:55.920 --> 44:59.930
You could fix your house
to make it more comfortable.

45:00.490 --> 45:02.700
I don't have money
to fix the house.

45:03.500 --> 45:06.770
But if I sell the house,
I'll get a lot of money.

45:08.370 --> 45:11.010
You love her way too much!

45:12.370 --> 45:15.320
Work your side muscles!

45:15.370 --> 45:18.360
The wind is dying down.

45:19.540 --> 45:24.390
Let's go diving!

45:24.820 --> 45:26.520
The wind is dying down!

45:26.590 --> 45:28.160
Churn the butter!

45:28.220 --> 45:29.930
Let's go work!

45:30.190 --> 45:32.930
Wait, everyone...

45:41.530 --> 45:42.810
Put it over there.

45:44.370 --> 45:45.250
Hey!

45:45.600 --> 45:50.350
I'll you skip class
if you join the an club.

45:50.640 --> 45:53.680
That's why they joined, too.

45:57.350 --> 45:59.660
You don't know what to draw?

45:59.890 --> 46:02.530
Draw this bald guy first.

46:03.290 --> 46:04.100
Huh?

46:04.460 --> 46:05.490
Stan by sketching.

46:29.610 --> 46:30.560
Hey...

46:31.620 --> 46:35.000
You're not scribbing
in your notebook!

46:36.920 --> 46:38.090
I quit.

46:39.560 --> 46:41.160
- Hey.
- What?

46:41.260 --> 46:45.400
Drawing out here is
better than attending class.

46:46.900 --> 46:48.640
But go if you want to.

47:06.350 --> 47:08.230
Mrs. Hong!

47:08.720 --> 47:09.660
You're here.

47:09.720 --> 47:11.430
- Sit down.
- Okay.

47:14.360 --> 47:17.340
- Where's your granddaughter?
- She's studying, so be quiet.

47:19.500 --> 47:22.870
You didn't budge for months,
but you'll do anything for her.

47:22.870 --> 47:24.970
Be quiet and
just hand it over.

47:27.940 --> 47:29.890
Stamp your name here.

47:33.610 --> 47:36.680
I'll transfer you the money
first thing tomorrow morning.

47:37.220 --> 47:39.200
You sealed the deal!

47:42.250 --> 47:43.320
How wonderful!

47:46.320 --> 47:47.860
Much better!

47:50.930 --> 47:52.600
How am I supposed to draw that?

47:52.700 --> 47:56.300
Get every wrinkle exactly right.

47:59.940 --> 48:01.470
What do you need to draw?

48:01.940 --> 48:05.220
Niobe, of course.

48:05.380 --> 48:07.410
You delinquent.

48:08.610 --> 48:13.320
What you need to
draw is the light.

48:13.850 --> 48:15.200
Look over there.

48:17.690 --> 48:18.760
Now, look at that.

48:20.860 --> 48:24.330
If you want to be a good artist,
don't focus on the shadows.

48:25.730 --> 48:27.470
Focus on the light.

48:33.710 --> 48:34.550
Hye-ji!

48:37.910 --> 48:39.390
Want to see something cool?

49:06.200 --> 49:07.410
Isn't it nice?

49:11.510 --> 49:12.850
Why are you doing this?

49:14.380 --> 49:15.860
I just feel a connection.

49:17.820 --> 49:18.790
And...

49:20.850 --> 49:22.060
You're pretty.

49:29.190 --> 49:30.200
This is making me sleepy.

49:30.300 --> 49:31.540
Don't you have any other song?

49:52.380 --> 49:53.920
Sorry about that.

49:57.520 --> 49:58.520
Do you want to
make a call?

50:08.830 --> 50:09.810
Hello?

50:10.340 --> 50:11.140
Min-hee.

50:11.670 --> 50:12.610
Hye-ji?

50:16.740 --> 50:17.780
Hello?

50:18.510 --> 50:19.650
Who is this?

50:21.180 --> 50:22.780
Hye-ji, it's me.

50:23.250 --> 50:24.780
You can't just
disappear like that.

50:24.850 --> 50:25.920
Put Min-hee on the phone.

50:26.890 --> 50:28.920
Min-hee is kind of busy.

50:29.150 --> 50:31.460
- Be quiet!
- What are you doing?

50:32.360 --> 50:33.800
It's not what you think.

50:33.860 --> 50:35.700
He's asking for a settlement.

50:35.760 --> 50:37.740
We're hoping you could
come up with the money.

50:38.700 --> 50:41.610
Your only friend's life
is on the line.

50:42.400 --> 50:43.810
Don't you lay a finger on her.

50:45.940 --> 50:47.710
Otherwise I will kill you.

50:50.440 --> 50:52.580
You're being unreasonable.

50:53.410 --> 50:55.650
Anyway, we don't have
much time.

50:55.710 --> 50:58.350
Get me the money or

50:58.420 --> 51:00.900
I'm going to pimp Min-hee.

51:04.320 --> 51:06.890
You should have told me
right away when she called.

51:09.530 --> 51:10.600
What am I going to do?

51:13.500 --> 51:16.480
Stop talking nonsense
and get back to work!

51:16.530 --> 51:21.750
Hye-ji is disrespectful
and she wears short skins!

51:21.810 --> 51:24.310
Isn't she a delinquent?

51:24.380 --> 51:26.620
It's just fashion!

51:26.680 --> 51:29.660
You were like that when
you were young, too!

51:29.710 --> 51:32.190
- Be quiet!
- But...

51:32.250 --> 51:35.320
I know you love Hye-ji.

51:35.450 --> 51:38.490
But people saw her
smoking cigarettes!

51:38.560 --> 51:39.900
Did you see it with
your own eyes?

51:39.960 --> 51:42.730
Yes, I saw it once!

51:42.790 --> 51:45.300
They're just rumors!

51:45.360 --> 51:46.810
Hye-ji is...

51:46.870 --> 51:51.440
When she was gone, you all
told me she'd be doing fine!

51:51.500 --> 51:52.740
That's right!

51:52.800 --> 51:56.480
You should help her lead a
good life now that she's back!

51:56.540 --> 51:58.280
What is all the fuss?

51:59.710 --> 52:00.710
What do you think?

52:02.350 --> 52:03.350
About what?

52:03.880 --> 52:06.520
About your drawings.

52:08.450 --> 52:10.430
- They're nice.
- Really?

52:11.690 --> 52:16.700
I'm giving you special lessons
because I like your wild side.

52:16.930 --> 52:17.770
Hey.

52:17.900 --> 52:20.810
But you have no
personal style!

52:21.770 --> 52:23.710
I guess I'm not talented.

52:26.300 --> 52:27.650
I don't want to learn an.

52:27.940 --> 52:29.280
Lee Hye-ji...

52:31.610 --> 52:34.180
Why do you have to
make life so difficult?

52:35.450 --> 52:37.430
Never mind.

52:38.550 --> 52:41.500
You'd better take these back.

52:43.490 --> 52:47.730
Your grandmother asked
me to teach you an

52:47.790 --> 52:50.670
so that you'd enjoy life.
She gave me

52:51.660 --> 52:54.230
bracken, seaweed...

52:55.530 --> 52:56.770
Ginseng liquor...

53:00.570 --> 53:03.640
I know you had a hard life.

53:04.440 --> 53:07.690
It might strengthen
or weaken you.

53:08.280 --> 53:10.280
It's all up to you.

53:11.280 --> 53:14.260
If your grandmother
is this devoted...

53:14.750 --> 53:16.760
You should at least try.

53:27.930 --> 53:28.910
Ni hao!

53:29.330 --> 53:31.310
Ms.Yang, get him
a cup of coffee.

53:31.840 --> 53:34.720
I have something to ask you.

53:35.470 --> 53:36.750
He's not Chinese.

53:36.810 --> 53:38.010
Please sit down.

53:38.810 --> 53:41.380
Sir, it's a wasting time.

53:42.750 --> 53:45.460
Here is the best.

53:46.550 --> 53:49.790
Grudge, grudge-

54:06.270 --> 54:10.690
They're asking the Sea
God for protection.

54:10.740 --> 54:11.720
Hye-ji!

54:12.610 --> 54:14.090
Let's go over there.

54:14.150 --> 54:15.650
There's no need to be scared.

54:32.000 --> 54:32.800
Hye-ji!

54:32.860 --> 54:34.300
Where are you going?

54:34.300 --> 54:36.300
Come here.

55:14.940 --> 55:16.250
Sea God...

55:18.180 --> 55:23.220
Please have pity on
my granddaughter

55:23.280 --> 55:27.230
and help her
lead a good life.

55:27.420 --> 55:32.660
Please help her...
Please help her...

55:33.660 --> 55:34.660
<i>Hong Gye-chun
Bankbook</i>

55:40.930 --> 55:42.410
What am I doing?

55:45.500 --> 55:47.740
Are you sure you
looked everywhere?

55:47.810 --> 55:49.220
Of course.

55:52.310 --> 55:55.850
There's no sign of a break-in.

55:55.910 --> 55:58.260
Then, where did it go?

55:58.320 --> 56:01.630
Are you sure you left it there?

56:01.690 --> 56:03.670
Try to remember.

56:03.720 --> 56:05.170
Come in and have dinner!

56:05.860 --> 56:08.740
- You can go now.
- Yes, ma'am.

56:08.790 --> 56:09.830
Good bye.

56:10.860 --> 56:13.370
I'll not let him go
if I catch him.

56:14.400 --> 56:15.240
Miss...

56:15.700 --> 56:17.700
Have you seen anyone
suspicious around?

56:19.270 --> 56:20.310
I guess not.

56:21.210 --> 56:22.180
See you.

56:25.280 --> 56:30.250
How did someone find out
there's money in the house?

56:31.450 --> 56:33.160
- Honey!
- Yeah?

56:33.280 --> 56:34.590
Her money is gone?

56:34.650 --> 56:38.330
She says that 1.5 million won
vanished from her cupboard.

56:38.560 --> 56:39.690
The cupboard?

56:41.390 --> 56:47.470
Didn't you lend 1.5 million
won to the neighbor's son?

56:47.530 --> 56:49.880
You took it out of
your cupboard.

56:51.800 --> 56:53.150
That's right.

56:53.200 --> 56:56.650
Old age is making you forgetful!

56:56.710 --> 56:58.650
Stop it.

56:58.810 --> 56:59.880
Case solved!

57:01.250 --> 57:02.420
Oh, dear...

57:09.290 --> 57:11.270
- What are you doing?
- Huh?

57:13.630 --> 57:15.230
Well...

57:18.260 --> 57:20.260
I have an insect bite.

57:20.870 --> 57:21.870
I see.

57:24.900 --> 57:26.470
There are a lot of insects here.

57:49.490 --> 57:51.170
What are you doing?

57:51.330 --> 57:52.830
You scared me!

57:52.900 --> 57:54.900
Why are you so surprised?

57:56.700 --> 58:00.110
Let's have a word inside.

58:00.170 --> 58:01.380
Just do it here.

58:02.640 --> 58:09.180
You shouldn't use birthdays
as your bankbook passcode.

58:09.310 --> 58:11.820
Mine is the day
Hye-ji disappeared.

58:12.650 --> 58:16.060
Hye-ji might figure it
out, so change it.

58:16.190 --> 58:17.830
So what if Hye-ji knows?

58:19.220 --> 58:22.900
Well, I just saw...

58:23.330 --> 58:24.400
What?

58:25.300 --> 58:26.800
Never mind.

58:26.900 --> 58:28.210
Tell me!

58:29.270 --> 58:36.210
From now on, make a record
of all money transactions!

58:36.270 --> 58:40.520
And stop saying yes
to every single favor.

58:41.210 --> 58:42.190
Fine.

58:51.490 --> 58:53.530
- I'm leaving.
- Bye.

59:04.870 --> 59:07.150
Give me one.

59:24.190 --> 59:25.220
Hye-ji...

59:27.360 --> 59:30.530
Which is bigger,
the sea or the sky?

59:32.830 --> 59:34.370
The sky, of course.

59:36.330 --> 59:39.250
I guess you're all grown up.

59:50.550 --> 59:53.550
Even when life is hard...

59:56.320 --> 01:00:02.290
If someone's on your side,
it's possible to go on.

01:00:04.300 --> 01:00:11.270
I'm on your side, so live
however you want to.

01:00:17.680 --> 01:00:18.980
Ill...

01:00:20.440 --> 01:00:22.520
take care of everything.

01:00:59.920 --> 01:01:01.620
Hey, you delinquent.

01:01:02.890 --> 01:01:05.330
Who gives you inspiration?

01:01:07.430 --> 01:01:09.200
Inspiration?

01:01:09.290 --> 01:01:10.740
Draw that person.

01:01:12.800 --> 01:01:16.240
Are you going to quit again?

01:01:17.300 --> 01:01:18.540
I'll give it a try.

01:01:21.240 --> 01:01:22.220
Good.

01:01:22.570 --> 01:01:23.680
Sir...

01:01:24.580 --> 01:01:25.680
Yeah?

01:01:28.410 --> 01:01:30.260
What is it?

01:01:30.350 --> 01:01:31.920
Can you...

01:01:35.450 --> 01:01:37.690
Confess something
with a drawing?

01:01:39.920 --> 01:01:40.700
Hey...

01:01:44.260 --> 01:01:45.570
Do you have a crush on me?

01:01:46.360 --> 01:01:47.240
Huh?

01:01:48.430 --> 01:01:50.310
You silly girl.

01:01:53.500 --> 01:01:57.210
Turn off the radio if
you can't concentrate.

01:01:57.310 --> 01:01:58.410
That's okay.

01:02:06.450 --> 01:02:08.260
Why do you screw up your eyes?

01:02:08.690 --> 01:02:09.630
You'll get wrinkles.

01:02:09.690 --> 01:02:11.690
Because the sunlight is bright.

01:02:11.760 --> 01:02:13.430
Don't you have sunglasses?

01:02:13.960 --> 01:02:18.170
Blind people wear sunglasses.

01:02:18.300 --> 01:02:21.400
Did you wear sunblock
to protect your skin?

01:02:22.570 --> 01:02:24.310
I've lived so long that...

01:02:25.470 --> 01:02:27.750
My baby is nagging me.

01:02:39.750 --> 01:02:44.600
Why are you using
so much of it?

01:02:45.320 --> 01:02:47.330
A small amount
doesn't work.

01:02:55.200 --> 01:02:55.800
Wow...

01:02:57.340 --> 01:02:59.870
My grandchild is
taking care of me.

01:03:00.600 --> 01:03:05.180
Wear sunblock when
you're working outdoors.

01:03:08.250 --> 01:03:12.590
We should let it
sink into your skin.

01:03:13.680 --> 01:03:15.190
Like this.

01:03:16.750 --> 01:03:18.360
I applied too much.

01:03:20.290 --> 01:03:22.830
Use half of this amount.

01:03:25.400 --> 01:03:28.530
How far do we have to go?

01:03:28.530 --> 01:03:30.270
Shut up and follow me.

01:03:43.810 --> 01:03:46.190
Just imagine.

01:03:46.250 --> 01:03:50.220
Without light, this place
would be dark all the time.

01:03:50.620 --> 01:03:52.360
How sad would that be?

01:03:55.290 --> 01:04:00.330
You should use darker colors
for the trees over there.

01:04:00.460 --> 01:04:01.940
This pan should be lighter.

01:04:03.270 --> 01:04:05.250
Paint the clouds, too.

01:04:05.600 --> 01:04:10.140
It's not perfect, but
you portrayed light well.

01:04:10.210 --> 01:04:11.380
Here you go.

01:04:22.290 --> 01:04:23.490
Grandma!

01:04:29.690 --> 01:04:30.690
Grandma?

01:04:31.800 --> 01:04:34.300
Oh, it's you.

01:04:34.370 --> 01:04:35.840
What are you doing here?

01:04:37.600 --> 01:04:40.550
I should go diving.

01:04:41.270 --> 01:04:42.620
Take me with you.

01:04:42.670 --> 01:04:43.880
No way!

01:04:43.940 --> 01:04:47.910
I won't let you
become a diver!

01:04:49.310 --> 01:04:50.790
All right.

01:04:52.380 --> 01:04:54.390
But there's another way.

01:04:54.620 --> 01:04:57.460
I have it all figured out.

01:05:00.360 --> 01:05:02.500
Here, wear this.

01:05:04.400 --> 01:05:06.310
Will you be okay?

01:05:06.400 --> 01:05:08.240
I have all this equipment.

01:05:08.300 --> 01:05:11.500
Don't let go of my hand.

01:05:11.500 --> 01:05:12.500
Okay.-

01:06:05.390 --> 01:06:07.340
Don't you like it?

01:06:07.660 --> 01:06:09.160
Did you really draw this?

01:06:09.230 --> 01:06:11.170
Who else would
have drawn it?

01:06:17.570 --> 01:06:18.770
Wow...

01:06:20.500 --> 01:06:21.740
This is...

01:06:24.510 --> 01:06:26.250
Really good.

01:06:28.250 --> 01:06:31.230
You should enter this
art contest in Seoul.

01:06:32.850 --> 01:06:33.850
Take a look.

01:06:36.190 --> 01:06:37.760
This is great.

01:06:40.620 --> 01:06:44.330
Is it really good?

01:06:45.330 --> 01:06:46.640
Of course it is!

01:06:46.700 --> 01:06:48.540
I don't give out
fake compliments!

01:06:56.540 --> 01:06:57.810
You'll enter, right?

01:06:57.910 --> 01:06:58.940
Let's do it.

01:06:59.910 --> 01:07:01.410
I'll enter.

01:07:09.190 --> 01:07:10.630
I have something to ask you.

01:07:16.130 --> 01:07:16.930
Never mind.

01:07:18.260 --> 01:07:19.330
What is it?

01:07:19.760 --> 01:07:21.500
Let's talk about it later.

01:07:24.770 --> 01:07:25.770
Hye-ji.

01:07:31.280 --> 01:07:32.380
You go ahead.

01:07:33.210 --> 01:07:35.320
- Who is that?
- Just go!

01:07:40.350 --> 01:07:41.490
It's so nice here.

01:07:43.650 --> 01:07:45.130
How did you find me?

01:07:52.500 --> 01:07:54.270
You abandoned me.

01:07:56.830 --> 01:07:59.410
You're right.
I'm sorry.

01:08:05.280 --> 01:08:06.250
Could you...

01:08:09.250 --> 01:08:11.160
Get me some money?

01:08:14.450 --> 01:08:15.830
Are you still at it?

01:08:17.250 --> 01:08:18.529
I borrowed some money.

01:08:18.590 --> 01:08:20.590
Why would I have money?

01:08:24.229 --> 01:08:26.439
The down payment
for your house.

01:08:26.760 --> 01:08:28.710
What are you saying?

01:08:30.229 --> 01:08:32.180
You want me to
become a thief?

01:08:35.370 --> 01:08:36.850
Not at all.

01:08:40.840 --> 01:08:42.220
Then...

01:08:44.420 --> 01:08:47.620
I'll have to ask her myself.

01:08:47.689 --> 01:08:48.819
Are you crazy?

01:08:48.920 --> 01:08:51.300
Stay away from
my grandmother!

01:08:56.689 --> 01:08:57.899
Your grandmother?

01:09:01.500 --> 01:09:02.569
Then...

01:09:03.729 --> 01:09:05.770
Just tell me where
the bankbook is.

01:09:10.170 --> 01:09:10.810
Hey.

01:09:11.340 --> 01:09:13.880
Don't be like this.

01:09:15.250 --> 01:09:17.450
I'm on the verge here!

01:09:21.520 --> 01:09:24.800
Hye-ji, what are
you doing there?

01:09:25.520 --> 01:09:26.520
Grandma...

01:09:27.890 --> 01:09:32.430
I was at school drawing.

01:09:33.899 --> 01:09:36.810
- I'll show you.
- Okay.

01:09:38.439 --> 01:09:44.180
When you were young, people's faces
looked like squashed potatoes.

01:09:44.240 --> 01:09:48.550
But this is very nice.

01:09:50.279 --> 01:09:52.760
How did you get so talented?

01:09:54.590 --> 01:09:57.190
- Are you hungry?
- Yes.

01:10:09.700 --> 01:10:11.910
- Are you sick?
- Huh?

01:10:13.840 --> 01:10:14.820
Oh...

01:10:15.770 --> 01:10:19.480
At this age, you're always sick.

01:10:20.640 --> 01:10:21.750
Eat up.

01:10:33.260 --> 01:10:38.760
The thought of leaving this
house makes me sentimental.

01:11:59.010 --> 01:12:02.390
- Seok-ho!
- Oh, you're back.

01:12:02.610 --> 01:12:06.690
Why aren't you opening
the sea urchins?

01:12:06.750 --> 01:12:10.760
This is important, too.

01:12:10.820 --> 01:12:13.130
Look at this.

01:12:13.260 --> 01:12:14.260
What is it?

01:12:15.730 --> 01:12:18.330
Eat this if you get hungry.

01:12:18.660 --> 01:12:19.640
Okay.-

01:12:19.700 --> 01:12:23.400
Be careful of cars
and people in Seoul.

01:12:23.400 --> 01:12:24.540
Okay?

01:12:25.770 --> 01:12:31.310
I can't bear to be apart
for even one day.

01:12:32.640 --> 01:12:33.710
Do well.

01:12:33.710 --> 01:12:36.250
We'll be off, ma'am.

01:12:36.510 --> 01:12:39.320
Please look after my Hye-ji.

01:12:39.420 --> 01:12:41.490
- Don't worry.
- Thank you.

01:12:42.850 --> 01:12:43.830
Let's go.

01:12:44.290 --> 01:12:45.360
Good luck!

01:12:50.460 --> 01:12:51.370
What is it?

01:12:52.400 --> 01:12:53.840
Take this sunblock.

01:12:53.960 --> 01:12:55.310
You use it.

01:12:55.930 --> 01:12:59.780
Make sure you
apply a lot of it.

01:13:00.370 --> 01:13:01.470
Okay.-

01:13:04.270 --> 01:13:05.340
I'll get going.

01:13:05.880 --> 01:13:07.360
I see, hurry to go.

01:13:10.910 --> 01:13:12.220
Good luck!

01:13:14.380 --> 01:13:16.860
I'll check your ticket.
Here.

01:13:27.330 --> 01:13:28.670
Hello, Ma'am.

01:13:28.770 --> 01:13:30.210
Hye-ji's gone.

01:13:30.270 --> 01:13:31.300
Hye-ji.

01:13:32.300 --> 01:13:34.280
Go on ahead.

01:13:34.370 --> 01:13:36.350
- See you.
- Good bye.

01:13:51.390 --> 01:13:52.460
Thanks, Hye-ji.

01:13:53.890 --> 01:13:54.660
Daddy will...

01:13:54.790 --> 01:13:56.400
For the last time...

01:13:57.790 --> 01:13:59.400
Get out of my life.

01:14:05.170 --> 01:14:07.210
Thank you. Thank you.

01:14:14.780 --> 01:14:15.450
Hey!

01:14:16.350 --> 01:14:17.350
Hye-ji!

01:14:18.420 --> 01:14:19.890
What took you so long?

01:14:20.020 --> 01:14:21.360
Hurry UP-

01:14:31.460 --> 01:14:33.770
Are you nervous?

01:14:35.270 --> 01:14:39.270
Well, so are the others.

01:14:39.370 --> 01:14:40.810
They're all nervous.

01:14:41.340 --> 01:14:42.340
Stan drawing.

01:14:44.470 --> 01:14:46.550
I'll go take a nap.

01:14:48.310 --> 01:14:51.420
Make sure you check
how much time is left.

01:14:51.950 --> 01:14:52.860
All right?

01:14:57.890 --> 01:14:58.870
Hey!

01:14:59.260 --> 01:15:00.390
Long time no see!

01:15:02.330 --> 01:15:04.360
- It's been so long!
- How have you been?

01:15:04.460 --> 01:15:06.500
Good, do you want
to go get coffee?

01:15:06.560 --> 01:15:08.440
I'd love that!

01:15:08.500 --> 01:15:10.100
What a nice surprise.

01:15:20.280 --> 01:15:21.260
Hello?

01:15:24.850 --> 01:15:26.920
Participants, you have
ten minutes left.

01:15:27.280 --> 01:15:32.260
Please make sure you
hand in your drawings.

01:15:32.420 --> 01:15:38.460
Please make sure you
hand in your drawings.

01:16:00.580 --> 01:16:01.860
<i>Mr. Lee...</i>

01:16:02.590 --> 01:16:07.160
<i>The title of this work
is 'Confession'.</i>

01:16:08.890 --> 01:16:11.570
<i>Please look after
my grandmother.</i>

01:16:12.760 --> 01:16:14.170
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

01:16:14.800 --> 01:16:17.240
<i>Also, thank you.</i>

01:16:19.800 --> 01:16:20.800
<i>Mr. Lee...</i>

01:16:23.340 --> 01:16:30.620
<i>The light still feels
strange to me.</i>

01:16:32.950 --> 01:16:35.230
- Mrs. Hong...
- Yeah?

01:16:45.660 --> 01:16:47.370
Where's Hye-ji?

01:16:47.700 --> 01:16:51.580
She went to an art contest.

01:16:51.640 --> 01:16:54.210
Oh, she's in Seoul.

01:17:01.580 --> 01:17:03.250
Ma'am...

01:17:07.550 --> 01:17:08.860
Mrs. Hong...

01:17:08.950 --> 01:17:10.560
What the hell is it?

01:17:17.760 --> 01:17:19.800
- Well...
- What is this?

01:17:21.200 --> 01:17:25.310
It's a DNA test
of you and Hye-ji.

01:17:25.370 --> 01:17:27.370
<i>Not related It's a DNA test of
you and Hye-ji</i>

01:17:28.740 --> 01:17:30.380
You're wasting my time.

01:17:34.950 --> 01:17:36.450
Ma'am...

01:17:43.420 --> 01:17:49.460
It's time for you to
face the facts.

01:17:49.530 --> 01:17:55.200
It says that you and
Hye-ji aren't related.

01:17:56.370 --> 01:17:58.540
Then, who could she be?

01:17:58.600 --> 01:18:04.850
Why would she
pretend to be Hye-ji?

01:18:05.740 --> 01:18:06.880
Exactly.

01:18:09.680 --> 01:18:12.220
But...

01:18:12.880 --> 01:18:13.660
Awhile ago...

01:18:13.720 --> 01:18:15.620
I caught her going
through your closet.

01:18:15.620 --> 01:18:20.190
- You should check...
- Get lost!

01:18:22.160 --> 01:18:23.640
You were going
through my closet!

01:18:23.690 --> 01:18:26.470
Do you want my
money so much?

01:18:29.530 --> 01:18:31.270
Yes, I went through it.

01:18:33.400 --> 01:18:36.210
You're being so frustrating!

01:18:38.440 --> 01:18:39.820
Do what you want!

01:18:55.960 --> 01:18:59.430
Mrs. Hong, I think
this is fake.

01:19:00.260 --> 01:19:03.570
I'll make them do another test.

01:19:17.280 --> 01:19:19.520
- Hello, sir!
- Good evening!

01:19:19.580 --> 01:19:22.650
Are you getting drunk
out on the streets?

01:19:23.320 --> 01:19:24.300
Hey!

01:19:25.720 --> 01:19:26.930
You talking to me?

Wow...

01:19:35.400 --> 01:19:37.740
You look so good that
I didn't recognize you.

01:19:39.400 --> 01:19:42.710
- What are you glaring at?
- Where is Min-hee?

01:19:42.840 --> 01:19:44.710
- Goddamn it!
- Give me the bag.

01:19:44.710 --> 01:19:46.810
- Hye-ji!
- Min-hee!

01:19:47.240 --> 01:19:48.520
- Get off of me!
- Hye-ji!

01:19:48.580 --> 01:19:49.280
Min-hee!

Why are you guys doing this?

01:20:07.760 --> 01:20:10.300
- I knew it!
- Get off of me!

01:20:13.900 --> 01:20:15.280
Nam Hye-ji.

01:20:15.510 --> 01:20:17.750
Do you know how many
crimes you were charged with?

01:20:17.840 --> 01:20:22.650
If it weren't for your friend,
you'd be framed for all of them.

01:20:24.380 --> 01:20:26.690
Who should I put down
as your guardian?

01:20:27.520 --> 01:20:29.790
- Let go of me!
- Calm down, ma'am!

01:20:30.350 --> 01:20:31.890
- Hye-ji!
- Ma'am...

01:20:31.890 --> 01:20:33.420
- Hye-ji...
- You can't come in here.

01:20:33.490 --> 01:20:34.800
Let me go.

01:20:35.530 --> 01:20:38.840
You look so unwell.

01:20:39.230 --> 01:20:41.440
Come on, let's go home.

01:20:41.500 --> 01:20:43.500
Ma'am, please calm down.

01:20:43.600 --> 01:20:44.480
Let's go.

01:20:44.570 --> 01:20:46.380
Let go of me!

01:20:52.610 --> 01:20:53.610
Hye-ji...

01:20:54.480 --> 01:20:56.510
You're Hye-ji, right?

01:20:59.880 --> 01:21:04.830
People keep telling
me that you're not.

01:21:04.890 --> 01:21:08.800
But I won't believe it.

01:21:08.860 --> 01:21:11.500
You said that you're Hye-ji.

01:21:12.200 --> 01:21:14.330
Look at me.

01:21:14.800 --> 01:21:16.400
Look at your grandma.

01:21:18.840 --> 01:21:20.340
I'm sorry.

01:21:34.620 --> 01:21:35.690
Then...

01:21:37.450 --> 01:21:39.590
Where's Hye-ji?

01:21:39.790 --> 01:21:42.330
My Hye-ji...

01:21:43.490 --> 01:21:44.560
Where is she?

01:21:44.560 --> 01:21:46.470
You need to calm down.

01:21:46.560 --> 01:21:48.410
Let's go sit down.

01:21:53.000 --> 01:21:57.450
The security camera caught you
and your daughter confessed.

01:21:57.540 --> 01:21:59.040
You can't deny it.

01:22:00.580 --> 01:22:02.580
So, just give UP-

01:22:03.410 --> 01:22:05.690
Hye-ji is dead.

01:22:06.920 --> 01:22:08.360
Hye-ji...

01:22:09.920 --> 01:22:12.830
I miss grandma.

01:22:12.890 --> 01:22:15.800
Take me back to her.

01:22:16.390 --> 01:22:18.770
I told you to stop
mentioning her!

01:22:18.830 --> 01:22:20.140
Why do you keep doing it?

01:22:23.630 --> 01:22:25.640
We can't afford to
raise two kids.

01:22:25.700 --> 01:22:28.410
If you're worried about money...

01:22:28.470 --> 01:22:30.250
Stop gambling.

01:22:30.340 --> 01:22:32.980
- Why do you bring that up?
- Why wouldn't I?

01:22:32.980 --> 01:22:35.710
- You kidnapped her!
- No, I didn't!

01:22:35.710 --> 01:22:38.450
- You brought her whatever you feel!
- I will raise up her.

01:22:38.520 --> 01:22:39.290
Am I wrong?

01:22:45.360 --> 01:22:47.930
I'm from KIG Insurance.

01:22:47.990 --> 01:22:51.670
I'm looking for Nam Hyun-cheol.

01:22:51.960 --> 01:22:55.340
You'll have to look
for him yourself.

01:23:01.600 --> 01:23:04.410
Is there a Nam Hyun-cheol here?

01:23:07.310 --> 01:23:10.380
That would be me.

01:23:10.750 --> 01:23:13.350
We saw the pictures
from today's accident.

01:23:13.420 --> 01:23:17.390
It says here that you
have two daughters.

01:23:17.450 --> 01:23:21.230
Nam Eun-joo is my
biological daughter.

01:23:21.320 --> 01:23:24.530
I'll record the two deaths.

01:23:24.990 --> 01:23:26.270
Hye-ji...

01:23:27.930 --> 01:23:31.280
At least you survived.

01:23:33.770 --> 01:23:37.270
I know you're going
through a hard time

01:23:37.470 --> 01:23:42.550
but there's some paperwork
you need to fill out.

01:23:44.380 --> 01:23:45.380
I'm terribly sorry.

01:23:47.920 --> 01:23:49.760
What a horrible father.

01:23:51.650 --> 01:23:54.460
How could he
use his children?

01:23:54.990 --> 01:23:58.600
Switching his own child
to commit insurance fraud...

01:23:58.660 --> 01:23:59.770
<i>Nam Eun-joo</i>

01:23:59.830 --> 01:24:01.540

01:24:20.620 --> 01:24:21.560
Mrs. Hong!

01:24:22.290 --> 01:24:23.860
It wasn't prostitution, right?

01:24:26.590 --> 01:24:30.770
You lured him to the motel
only to steal his money.

01:24:38.740 --> 01:24:43.840
Do you admit to
committing identity theft?

01:24:52.650 --> 01:24:53.820
Thumbprint, please.

01:25:22.650 --> 01:25:24.560
Who is this?

01:25:25.780 --> 01:25:30.250
This is Seok-ho
and my grandma.

01:25:30.450 --> 01:25:32.900
This is Toya,
the outhouse pig.

01:25:32.960 --> 01:25:37.270
If you poop, he
comes and eats it.

01:25:37.790 --> 01:25:38.670
He eats poop?

01:25:38.730 --> 01:25:42.870
Yes, but if you pee
he gets disappointed.

01:25:45.600 --> 01:25:51.780
Here, you can have
this gold crayon.

01:25:52.410 --> 01:25:55.320
Can I really have it?

01:25:56.510 --> 01:25:57.320
Yes.

01:25:57.750 --> 01:26:01.390
But you have to give it back
when you see grandma.

01:26:01.920 --> 01:26:04.760
I have to color
my grandma's hair.

01:27:11.690 --> 01:27:13.630
Grandma!

01:27:20.630 --> 01:27:23.300
Grandma, I'm hungry!

01:27:30.910 --> 01:27:34.290
Oh, sweetie...

01:27:35.810 --> 01:27:37.290
Let's eat.

01:27:52.900 --> 01:27:54.170

to focus on the light.

so please look at it.

Yes, I'm okay.

to live with us.

Why...

01:32:29.410 --> 01:32:31.320
Didn't you tell me?

01:32:31.470 --> 01:32:33.420
She's so stubborn.

01:32:36.610 --> 01:32:40.030

01:39:44.540 --> 01:39:45.810
Sit over here.

01:40:02.360 --> 01:40:04.130
Why are you all standing?

01:40:04.690 --> 01:40:06.540
Do you recognize me?

01:40:07.630 --> 01:40:08.870
Of course.

01:40:09.570 --> 01:40:12.380
I'm not blind you know.

01:40:12.940 --> 01:40:15.680
I'll make you dinner.

01:40:15.740 --> 01:40:17.180
Do your homework.

01:40:26.580 --> 01:40:29.390
What are you staring at?

01:40:32.590 --> 01:40:36.370
What are you doing
in front of my house?

01:40:38.760 --> 01:40:39.830
Grandma...

01:40:40.660 --> 01:40:42.700
Let's get out of the cold.

01:40:50.340 --> 01:40:51.480
Hye-ji...

01:40:53.610 --> 01:40:55.450
Will you be okay
on your own?

01:40:56.450 --> 01:40:57.920
Let's get inside.

01:41:28.810 --> 01:41:32.690
Grandma, tell me
if you get cold.

01:41:34.280 --> 01:41:35.490
Pretty.

01:41:44.430 --> 01:41:45.600
Grandma?

01:41:47.430 --> 01:41:48.410
Grandma?

01:41:50.830 --> 01:41:52.110
Grandma Gye-chun!

01:41:54.300 --> 01:41:56.980
Grandma!

01:42:12.590 --> 01:42:13.930
Grandma Gye-chun...

01:42:15.560 --> 01:42:18.400
Grandma, don't do that!

01:42:20.400 --> 01:42:22.710
I guess it's too late.

01:42:26.270 --> 01:42:27.410
Aren't you cold?

01:42:37.580 --> 01:42:38.720
Grandma...

01:42:41.580 --> 01:42:43.360
Let me paint on you, too.

01:42:59.800 --> 01:43:01.580
That stings.

01:43:01.640 --> 01:43:03.210
Lift your head.

01:43:04.210 --> 01:43:06.190
Then, it will end faster.

01:43:16.180 --> 01:43:19.320
The sky is in the sea.

01:43:22.390 --> 01:43:24.630
In the sea...

01:43:28.260 --> 01:43:29.830
In the sea...

01:43:35.540 --> 01:43:37.540
You are my sea.

01:43:37.940 --> 01:43:39.820
The sky is in the sea.

01:43:40.740 --> 01:43:42.020
Warm yourself at a stove.

01:43:42.740 --> 01:43:44.350
- Is she asleep?
- Yes, she is.

01:43:44.750 --> 01:43:47.630
Here. It's from my wife.

01:43:55.390 --> 01:43:57.230
Now I'm relieved.

01:43:59.330 --> 01:44:03.740
I would've been hurt if
she didn't recognize us.

01:44:07.600 --> 01:44:10.410
By the way,
what's that painting about?

01:44:11.210 --> 01:44:12.240
That's really nice.

01:44:14.440 --> 01:44:15.790
- Seok-ho.
- Yes.

01:44:16.750 --> 01:44:18.750
Which is bigger,
the sea or the sky?

01:44:18.810 --> 01:44:21.160
The sky is bigger obviously,
isn't it?

01:44:21.880 --> 01:44:24.190
No. The sea is bigger.

01:44:28.420 --> 01:44:32.890
The sea embraces the sky.

01:45:09.360 --> 01:45:10.670
Let's see...

01:45:12.200 --> 01:45:16.840
The password of the account is
0512, 0512.

01:45:18.270 --> 01:45:20.510
Hye-ji can you hear this?

01:45:22.740 --> 01:45:23.780
I'll just

01:45:24.710 --> 01:45:27.250
call you Hye-ji-

01:45:28.980 --> 01:45:36.200
To be honest, I might
have already known...

01:45:39.490 --> 01:45:41.500
That you're not Hye-ji.

01:45:42.700 --> 01:45:45.640
I just didn't want

01:45:45.700 --> 01:45:47.440
to admit it.

01:45:48.940 --> 01:45:51.780
Which is bigger,
the sea or the sky?

01:45:51.840 --> 01:46:00.620
I used to think that it
would have been better

01:46:00.720 --> 01:46:08.330
if I'd died without realizing
that you're not Hye-ji.

01:46:12.390 --> 01:46:13.900
But not anymore.

01:46:17.300 --> 01:46:21.750
You're my grandchild, too.

01:46:24.570 --> 01:46:30.180
There's no doubt that
you're my grandchild.

01:46:31.310 --> 01:46:33.290
Being related by blood...

01:46:37.390 --> 01:46:41.800
That doesn't matter at all.

01:46:44.790 --> 01:46:46.400
You were always

01:46:46.760 --> 01:46:50.540
my grandchild.

01:46:56.910 --> 01:46:58.650
My granddaughter...

01:46:59.340 --> 01:47:02.380
I made a living as a diver.

01:47:02.580 --> 01:47:07.320
You should make a living
as an artist.

01:47:09.450 --> 01:47:11.450
My life was hard.

01:47:13.390 --> 01:47:16.340
But near the end, I met you.

01:47:17.360 --> 01:47:18.430
Soon,

01:47:20.300 --> 01:47:22.280
I'll die.

01:47:24.300 --> 01:47:26.870
But I don't want
to leave you...

01:47:33.810 --> 01:47:36.690
I don't want to leave you...

01:47:39.750 --> 01:47:43.160
I don't want to leave you...

01:47:49.260 --> 01:47:52.900
I don't want to leave you...

01:48:04.270 --> 01:48:05.410
I'm sorry.

01:48:10.610 --> 01:48:12.250
I'm sorry.

01:48:20.760 --> 01:48:23.260
Grandma, I'm sorry.

01:48:28.830 --> 01:48:31.210
Grandma...

01:48:49.350 --> 01:48:50.490
Sweetie...

01:49:00.930 --> 01:49:03.030
Grandma, are you okay?

01:49:05.730 --> 01:49:07.740
I was so worried.

01:49:09.170 --> 01:49:15.820
Why did you waste
paint like that?

01:49:15.880 --> 01:49:17.750
You wanted to see flowers.

01:49:18.310 --> 01:49:20.050
They're...

01:49:21.850 --> 01:49:26.130
The prettiest flowers
I've ever seen.

01:49:33.930 --> 01:49:35.270
Eun-joo...

01:49:41.340 --> 01:49:42.940
Eun-joo...

01:49:44.710 --> 01:49:46.380
Eun-joo...

01:49:51.380 --> 01:49:54.360
It's time for me...

01:49:56.320 --> 01:49:59.300
To join Hye-ji-.

01:50:01.460 --> 01:50:03.300
She's so young.

01:50:04.430 --> 01:50:09.310
I kept her waiting
for far too long.

01:50:16.700 --> 01:50:18.340
What about me?

01:50:19.370 --> 01:50:21.820
Keep on living.

01:50:25.180 --> 01:50:29.250
Lead a good life.

01:50:30.590 --> 01:50:37.900
I'll never forget you,
even in heaven.

01:50:40.500 --> 01:50:48.850
Thank you so much for
becoming my grandchild.

01:51:11.290 --> 01:51:12.290
Grandma.

01:51:16.530 --> 01:51:17.640
Good-bye.

01:51:21.600 --> 01:51:24.240
But don't go too fast.

01:51:29.580 --> 01:51:31.280
Grandma...

01:51:35.420 --> 01:51:36.660
I will.

01:51:40.790 --> 01:51:42.670
I'll lead a good life.

01:51:45.260 --> 01:51:46.640
I promise.

01:51:51.370 --> 01:51:52.500
Grandma...

01:51:54.200 --> 01:51:55.270
I love you.

01:52:16.890 --> 01:52:18.500
Hey-ji.

01:52:19.430 --> 01:52:21.240
Where are you?

01:52:23.670 --> 01:52:25.510
I can't find you!

01:52:28.340 --> 01:52:30.280
Hye-ji!

01:52:32.670 --> 01:52:33.910
Grandma!

01:52:36.440 --> 01:52:38.220
Where are you?

01:52:39.950 --> 01:52:41.720
I can't find you!

01:52:42.480 --> 01:52:44.330
Grandma!

01:52:44.820 --> 01:52:46.700
Come find me!

01:52:47.360 --> 01:52:48.860
Hye-ji!

01:52:49.420 --> 01:52:51.340
Grandma!

01:52:52.490 --> 01:52:54.440
I'm right here!

01:52:55.700 --> 01:52:58.640
Grandma Gye-chun!

01:52:58.700 --> 01:53:00.240
Oh...

01:53:00.300 --> 01:53:02.180
- My baby.
- Grandma!

01:53:03.270 --> 01:53:05.380
What took you so long?

01:53:12.750 --> 01:53:14.890
Did you miss me?

01:53:15.220 --> 01:53:18.220
I missed you so much.

01:53:22.360 --> 01:53:23.300
Grandma.

01:53:23.360 --> 01:53:24.770
Don't go anywhere.

01:53:25.260 --> 01:53:28.430
Yeah, I won't go anywhere.

01:53:57.460 --> 01:53:58.940
Artist Lee.

01:53:59.460 --> 01:54:01.240
- Over here.
- Look at this.

01:54:02.560 --> 01:54:07.210
- It's me and Mrs. Hong!
- You're right.

01:54:07.340 --> 01:54:08.680
You're in it, too.

01:54:10.270 --> 01:54:13.580
This was Hye-ji's
welcome home party!

01:54:13.640 --> 01:54:14.750
Look at that!

01:54:17.410 --> 01:54:18.580
Wow...

01:54:19.410 --> 01:54:21.690
She's so talented.

01:54:22.450 --> 01:54:24.860
This looks just like Mrs. Hong.

01:54:25.790 --> 01:54:27.360
Is that your grandma?

01:54:27.460 --> 01:54:31.300
I wish she could
have seen this.

01:54:31.660 --> 01:54:32.690
Me, too.

01:54:34.430 --> 01:54:35.640
It's great.

01:54:38.800 --> 01:54:40.870
It's all thanks to you.

01:54:44.370 --> 01:54:49.380
But there is something you learn
naturally as you get growing.
