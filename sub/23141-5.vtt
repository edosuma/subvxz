00:01.435 --> 00:03.137
Lady Luck
is on your side
from LA to Vegas.

00:03.171 --> 00:06.707
What, are you gonna put
a sock on the cockpit door?
Don't cockpit-block me.

00:06.740 --> 00:08.042
Catch all-new episodes Tuesdays.

00:08.076 --> 00:09.743
And check out
our other Fox programs,

00:09.777 --> 00:11.812
The Mick, The Last Man on Earth,

00:11.845 --> 00:12.980
and Brooklyn Nine-Nine.

00:13.013 --> 00:14.482
The kids are gonna love it.

00:14.515 --> 00:15.583
Only on Fox.

00:17.185 --> 00:20.754
*

00:23.224 --> 00:26.060
Hey, old girl.

00:26.094 --> 00:28.896
You ready to bend gravity over
and have our way with it?

00:30.231 --> 00:32.333
Hola, amigo.

00:32.366 --> 00:33.534
I'm Hawaiian.

00:33.567 --> 00:36.604
Sorry. Aloha, amigo.

00:36.637 --> 00:37.938
Listen...

00:37.971 --> 00:39.740
Izzy,

00:39.773 --> 00:42.776
we go way back, so I don't mind
saying, you guys are slipping.

00:42.810 --> 00:45.346
Your job is to clean this plane
from soup to nuts,

00:45.379 --> 00:47.681
and you're doing a great job
on the soup,

00:47.715 --> 00:50.551
but the nuts need
a little more attention.

00:50.584 --> 00:52.220
I can't spend my time
cleaning my own cockpit.

00:52.253 --> 00:53.754
Unless any of you know
how to land a plane

00:53.787 --> 00:54.955
and want to switch jobs.

00:54.988 --> 00:57.525
I'm actually
at 1,300 pilot hours, so...

00:57.558 --> 00:58.859
Exactly. So moving forward,

00:58.892 --> 01:00.794
let's see some
of that extra effort.

01:02.563 --> 01:04.232
Kobe!

01:09.937 --> 01:11.205
PILOT :
Jackpot Airlines.

01:11.239 --> 01:12.940
Northeast-bound to Las Vegas.

01:12.973 --> 01:15.943
*

01:19.580 --> 01:22.583
Oh. Look at the bag on this one.

01:22.616 --> 01:25.052
Good luck getting that
in the overhead.

01:25.085 --> 01:27.521
Ugh. Tiny white women have no
idea how much trouble they are.

01:28.922 --> 01:31.091
You're a nightmare.

01:32.193 --> 01:33.161
Pick me up.

01:33.194 --> 01:35.263
This feels like a trap.

01:35.296 --> 01:37.565
Sorry. I'm so sorry.

01:37.598 --> 01:40.834
Awkward introductions.
This is my son, Nate.

01:40.868 --> 01:43.171
He had an accident
and escaped mid-change.

01:43.204 --> 01:45.173
Don't worry,
all the poop's been wiped off.

01:45.206 --> 01:47.074
It's just standard airport filth
on him now.

01:47.107 --> 01:48.276
-If I had knees like that,

01:48.309 --> 01:50.278
I'd never take off my pants.

01:50.311 --> 01:51.945
It's his first time coming
to L.A. with me,

01:51.979 --> 01:54.915
so, as you can see,
it's incredibly stressful.

01:54.948 --> 01:57.451
Oh, well, um, hello, Nate.

01:57.485 --> 01:59.920
-It's nice to meet you.

01:59.953 --> 02:01.755
You're supposed to let them
smell your hand first

02:01.789 --> 02:03.023
so they know you're friendly.

02:03.056 --> 02:04.958
You're thinking of dogs.
You don't have

02:04.992 --> 02:06.960
a lot of experience
with children, do you?

02:06.994 --> 02:08.962
No, but, in middle school,
I did go

02:08.996 --> 02:11.699
to a lot of my friends'
baby showers.

02:11.732 --> 02:13.367
Oh, look, Nate.

02:13.401 --> 02:16.437
There's the pilot. He's gonna be
flying the big plane.

02:16.470 --> 02:17.771
Captain Dave.

02:17.805 --> 02:19.139
Don't do drugs.

02:19.173 --> 02:20.774
Yet.

02:20.808 --> 02:22.142
Um...

02:24.144 --> 02:26.447
Is that my little Nate

02:26.480 --> 02:28.148
Oh, I could just snort you up.

02:28.182 --> 02:29.817
Hi there, big boy.

02:29.850 --> 02:32.019
Do you remember us
from your birthday party?

02:32.052 --> 02:33.887
I'm your Uncle Artem!

02:33.921 --> 02:35.489
Just "Artem" is fine.

02:35.523 --> 02:38.459
What is that behind your ear?

02:38.492 --> 02:40.461
Oh!

02:42.696 --> 02:44.798
Thank...

02:44.832 --> 02:46.667
Aw. He's a natural.

02:46.700 --> 02:48.001
ARTEM :
Yeah.

02:51.539 --> 02:55.476
There he Iz... zy.

02:55.509 --> 02:57.478
Hope you don't mind
the tough love before.

02:57.511 --> 02:59.313
No. In fact, it inspired us.

02:59.347 --> 03:01.649
I feel like we did
an extra good job today.

03:01.682 --> 03:03.984
Good, good. I mean, obviously,
I'll be the judge of that,

03:04.017 --> 03:05.819
but I like the confidence.

03:05.853 --> 03:08.489
Another bit of advice--
when you smile about stuff,

03:08.522 --> 03:10.190
it looks suspicious.

03:15.696 --> 03:16.997
Are you okay?

03:17.030 --> 03:18.666
I can see your body glitter,

03:18.699 --> 03:21.502
but that usual sparkle is gone.

03:21.535 --> 03:23.203
It wasn't a great weekend.
Last night,

03:23.237 --> 03:25.205
I'm at the club
wearing my schoolgirl outfit,

03:25.239 --> 03:27.541
ready to dance,
and the DJ intro'd me by saying,

03:27.575 --> 03:29.343
"Don't worry, guys,
she's legal."

03:29.377 --> 03:32.713
So, legal is no good?

03:32.746 --> 03:34.047
No. Don't you understand?

03:34.081 --> 03:35.883
Before, I was "barely legal."

03:35.916 --> 03:37.851
Now I'm just "legal."

03:37.885 --> 03:38.952
You take out that "barely,"
and I'm just another

03:38.986 --> 03:41.722
middle-aged girl dancing
the brunch shift.

03:41.755 --> 03:43.190
-But, uh...
-Oh, my God,

03:43.223 --> 03:44.925
I can smell the middle age
on me.

03:44.958 --> 03:47.795
It smells of old and death.

03:47.828 --> 03:50.130
No, that's not you.

03:50.163 --> 03:52.132
And I have smelled death before,

03:52.165 --> 03:55.035
and there's relief in it.

03:55.068 --> 03:57.471
This is much worse.

03:59.407 --> 04:01.074
I can taste it.

04:01.108 --> 04:03.411
Don't worry,
I'll get to the bottom of this.

04:03.444 --> 04:06.079
Ronnie!

04:08.081 --> 04:10.451
Yeah, it's rough back there. The
smell has moved up to row eight.

04:10.484 --> 04:11.785
We have to do something.

04:11.819 --> 04:13.787
I can't smell anything
ever since I snorted wasabi

04:13.821 --> 04:16.324
-on a dare. -I'm sorry, Alan,
you should have said "truth."

04:16.357 --> 04:18.158
Does anyone know where the hell
it's coming from?

04:18.191 --> 04:19.327
Have we checked
if anyone brought on...

04:19.360 --> 04:20.961
It's not ethnic food.

04:20.994 --> 04:22.830
Well, one of these stinky
ground-os brought something,

04:22.863 --> 04:24.832
because my boys didn't say
anything about a smell.

04:24.865 --> 04:26.734
-The cleaning crew.

04:26.767 --> 04:27.801
I talked to them this morning.

04:27.835 --> 04:29.169
-There it is.
-Smell explained.

04:29.202 --> 04:30.904
It's not like that.
I came on, gave a pep talk,

04:30.938 --> 04:32.840
shot some hoops.
They called me Kobe.

04:32.873 --> 04:34.308
Well, we can't make people
fly like this.

04:34.342 --> 04:37.378
So, I guess it's time
to make everyone angry.

04:39.380 --> 04:41.081
So sorry.

04:41.114 --> 04:42.916
Thank you for your patience.

04:42.950 --> 04:44.518
Don't worry,
the smell isn't him.

04:44.552 --> 04:46.186
No, I know. This just smells
much better.

04:47.721 --> 04:50.023
-WOMAN:
Flight 237 with nonstop service

04:50.057 --> 04:53.093
to Los Angeles has been delayed
until further notice.

04:53.126 --> 04:54.762
-We apologize for
the inconvenience. -Excuse me.

04:54.795 --> 04:56.830
Uh, the contents
of this briefcase need to be

04:56.864 --> 04:58.532
in Los Angeles by 5:00 p.m.

04:58.566 --> 04:59.867
It should just be a minor delay.

04:59.900 --> 05:01.201
The contents of this briefcase
need to be

05:01.234 --> 05:02.703
in Los Angeles by 5:00 p.m.

05:02.736 --> 05:05.339
Okay. Sit tight.

05:05.373 --> 05:07.140
Uh, Ronnie, hi.

05:07.174 --> 05:09.610
Yeah, I know... I know
the plane has been cleared.

05:09.643 --> 05:12.346
Is there any way I could pop
back on and get something?

05:12.380 --> 05:14.382
-What do you think this is,
September 10? -It's just,

05:14.415 --> 05:16.950
I left Nate's Yellow Bear,
and he's very attached to it.

05:16.984 --> 05:20.120
If he wakes up, it's not there,
he's gonna... have a meltdown.

05:20.153 --> 05:22.122
Can't you just feed him a treat
and rub his belly?

05:22.155 --> 05:25.192
I'm very concerned about your
understanding of human children.

05:25.225 --> 05:26.360
Fine. I will get the bear.

05:26.394 --> 05:27.795
But I want him to know
I'm the hero.

05:27.828 --> 05:29.129
I mean, I don't want hugs
or affection,

05:29.162 --> 05:30.398
but I want the credit.

05:30.431 --> 05:32.199
I will teach him
the concept of credit

05:32.232 --> 05:33.867
and have him direct it
toward you.

05:38.439 --> 05:40.140
RONNIE:
Oh, uh,

05:40.173 --> 05:41.909
I'm sorry,
where are you two going?

05:41.942 --> 05:43.043
Away from the smell.

05:43.076 --> 05:44.845
No, you have to go back in there
and fix it,

05:44.878 --> 05:46.580
since this is your fault.

05:46.614 --> 05:48.181
You're way,
way off base on this.

05:48.215 --> 05:49.383
Those guys love me.

05:49.417 --> 05:50.884
I'm like an inner city principal

05:50.918 --> 05:52.252
that finally got through
to them.

05:52.285 --> 05:54.021
Then it's time
to stand and deliver.

05:54.054 --> 05:56.256
-You still have to
find the smell.

05:56.289 --> 05:58.592
Because you're the captain,
damn it.

05:58.626 --> 06:01.061
And they didn't give you
that title because

06:01.094 --> 06:02.262
you run away from smells--

06:02.295 --> 06:04.665
they gave it to you
because you're a leader.

06:04.698 --> 06:05.999
You're right.

06:06.033 --> 06:09.069
It's all up to Captain Dave.

06:11.439 --> 06:12.740
You played to his ego.

06:12.773 --> 06:14.274
Smart.

06:14.307 --> 06:16.777
And I need you to go in
and help.

06:16.810 --> 06:19.447
You're the only person
I trust to watch him,

06:19.480 --> 06:22.049
with those beautiful,
ageless eyes

06:22.082 --> 06:24.785
that hold the wisdom
of a thousand Oprahs.

06:24.818 --> 06:26.253
I see what you're doing.

06:26.286 --> 06:27.488
And it worked.

06:31.058 --> 06:32.259
Hey.

06:35.162 --> 06:37.865
I'll have what she's having.

06:37.898 --> 06:39.600
Like the movie.

06:39.633 --> 06:44.304
You're Sally, and I'm old
Jewish woman who wants orgasm.

06:44.337 --> 06:45.573
I'm sorry.

06:45.606 --> 06:47.240
My day just keeps getting worse.

06:47.274 --> 06:49.109
The bartender
didn't even card me.

06:49.142 --> 06:51.479
I might as well start wearing
jackets with shoulder pads

06:51.512 --> 06:53.313
and posting on Facebook.

06:53.346 --> 06:55.315
Hey, listen, I have good news.

06:55.348 --> 06:58.251
I'm gonna teach you poker.

06:58.285 --> 07:00.788
You will be natural.

07:00.821 --> 07:02.923
You see,
poker's not just a card game--

07:02.956 --> 07:04.157
it is art.

07:04.191 --> 07:06.159
It requires intuition,

07:06.193 --> 07:09.162
deception,
and sometimes flirting.

07:09.196 --> 07:10.297
Like stripping.

07:10.330 --> 07:11.499
Bingo is your name-o!

07:11.532 --> 07:14.301
Now I will whip out my deck

07:14.334 --> 07:16.103
and teach you
how to play with it.

07:17.104 --> 07:19.139
Which one is bigger number,

07:19.172 --> 07:20.340
seven or ten?

07:20.373 --> 07:21.341
Ten.

07:21.374 --> 07:23.677
You are a fast learner.

07:23.711 --> 07:26.747
Just like Sheldon
on that Big Bang Bazinga show.

07:27.948 --> 07:30.283
Should we touch fists
and make them explode?

07:30.317 --> 07:31.284
Okay.

07:31.318 --> 07:32.553
-Explosion.

07:38.291 --> 07:40.494
Sorry, no bear,

07:40.528 --> 07:41.862
but I did find half a joint,

07:41.895 --> 07:44.197
so I guess I will go see
Cirque du Soleil with Artem.

07:44.231 --> 07:45.866
Oh, Yellow Bear wasn't in there?

07:45.899 --> 07:47.601
Oh, my God.
That means it could be anywhere.

07:47.635 --> 07:49.670
Um, okay, let me think.

07:49.703 --> 07:52.339
Uh, I know I had him
in the Lyft.

07:52.372 --> 07:53.941
The elevator "lift"
or the car "Lyft"?

07:53.974 --> 07:55.308
British people say things weird.

07:55.342 --> 07:56.810
The car Lyft.
I was holding the bear

07:56.844 --> 07:58.646
while Nate finished off
his aubergine Parmesan.

07:58.679 --> 08:00.514
Well, that means
it must be in the airport.

08:00.548 --> 08:02.015
I have to go and find it.

08:02.049 --> 08:03.517
We can't start our first week
together like this.

08:03.551 --> 08:04.852
He'll never want to come back.

08:04.885 --> 08:06.787
Okay, wait, wait, wait.
You're not gonna get anywhere

08:06.820 --> 08:09.657
in this place without me,
so I'll-I'll help you find him.

08:09.690 --> 08:11.324
Uh, what do I do about Nate?

08:11.358 --> 08:13.293
Uh... Oh, Alan.

08:13.326 --> 08:15.228
Can you watch Nate
for a little bit?

08:15.262 --> 08:17.731
-Sure. I'm great
with living things. -It's true.

08:17.765 --> 08:20.133
He tried to help his goldfish
find her birth parents.

08:20.167 --> 08:22.169
Perhaps we should be quite quick
about this, then.

08:22.202 --> 08:24.004
Yeah.

08:28.709 --> 08:30.077
If Yellow Bear is anywhere,

08:30.110 --> 08:31.679
he'll be at security.

08:31.712 --> 08:33.647
90% of stuff that gets lost
is left here.

08:33.681 --> 08:36.516
This damn bear
is the bane of my existence.

08:36.550 --> 08:39.019
We never should have given it
to him in the first place.

08:39.052 --> 08:40.888
Stuffed animals only breed

08:40.921 --> 08:43.056
irrational
emotional attachments.

08:43.090 --> 08:45.425
And, if left in the
wrong puddle, diphtheria.

08:45.458 --> 08:48.028
This guy has been left
in several puddles,

08:48.061 --> 08:50.330
and he hasn't given me anything
but kisses and hugs.

08:50.363 --> 08:51.331
What is that?

08:51.364 --> 08:53.601
My irrational
emotional attachment.

08:53.634 --> 08:55.502
His name is Ganz.
Well, actually,

08:55.535 --> 08:57.771
his full name
is Ganz Dieter Ganz.

08:57.805 --> 08:59.239
He's from the German
hinterlands,

08:59.272 --> 09:00.340
and he's a former
Olympic gymnast

09:00.373 --> 09:01.842
who retired to become a coach.

09:01.875 --> 09:03.443
Well, that's funny, 'cause
his tag just says "China."

09:03.476 --> 09:05.679
Would you rather hear
about how my dad traded

09:05.713 --> 09:07.547
all his cigarettes for him
at Wasco State Prison

09:07.581 --> 09:08.949
just so I'd have a date

09:08.982 --> 09:10.517
to my third grade
daddy

09:10.550 --> 09:12.886
I've never met
an Olympian before.

09:12.920 --> 09:14.855
Mm-hmm.

09:14.888 --> 09:17.124
-Hey, Annette. Do you have
a minute? -Oh, Ronnie,

09:17.157 --> 09:19.026
you picked a great day to come.

09:19.059 --> 09:21.128
There are some
very shady characters

09:21.161 --> 09:23.196
we need to keep our eye on.

09:23.230 --> 09:24.632
Oh...

09:24.665 --> 09:26.767
check out this one.

09:26.800 --> 09:30.938
He's trying to smuggle a thermos
in his pants.

09:30.971 --> 09:32.806
Hi, we're looking
for a stuffed yellow bear.

09:32.840 --> 09:35.075
-Um, might have been left here.

09:35.108 --> 09:36.576
Have you seen
anything like that?

09:36.610 --> 09:37.911
Maybe, but they just
did a pickup,

09:37.945 --> 09:39.813
so it'd be
in the TSA vault by now.

09:39.847 --> 09:42.115
Okay, thank you, Annette.
Let's hit the vault.

09:44.017 --> 09:45.452
We're making progress.
We killed the power

09:45.485 --> 09:46.754
to stop air circulation,

09:46.787 --> 09:48.889
and my candles are containing
the smell at row eight.

09:48.922 --> 09:50.724
You really travel
with all these?

09:50.758 --> 09:52.392
I have a very specific
bath-to-bed ritual.

09:52.425 --> 09:53.460
If it's good enough
for Angela Bassett,

09:53.493 --> 09:55.095
it's good enough for me.

09:55.128 --> 09:56.964
RONNIE : No, I don't
want it contained, Bernard.

09:56.997 --> 09:58.832
I want it dead.
Find that smell

09:58.866 --> 10:01.568
before we screw up
the whole day's schedule.

10:01.601 --> 10:03.270
You married three of those?

10:03.303 --> 10:05.005
Bernie, give it to me straight.
You really think

10:05.038 --> 10:06.606
the cleaning crew
did this to me on purpose?

10:06.640 --> 10:08.308
-I do.
Those guys love me.

10:08.341 --> 10:10.277
-They don't. -Well, maybe
not as much as the ground crew.

10:10.310 --> 10:11.278
-They don't, either.
-Okay, but...

10:11.311 --> 10:12.445
They really don't.

10:12.479 --> 10:13.681
You don't even know
what I was gonna say.

10:13.714 --> 10:15.015
It literally
could have been anyone.

10:15.048 --> 10:16.850
You're crazy.
I have a great relationship

10:16.884 --> 10:19.252
with everyone in this airport,
especially the support staff.

10:19.286 --> 10:21.621
I make friendly eye contact,
I give away

10:21.655 --> 10:22.923
my leftovers, I cover them

10:22.956 --> 10:24.792
with newspaper
when they look cold.

10:24.825 --> 10:27.360
Oh, my God. I treat them
like homeless people.

10:27.394 --> 10:29.096
I am a monster.

10:29.129 --> 10:30.497
David, you need to focus.

10:30.530 --> 10:32.199
We have to find the smell.

10:32.232 --> 10:34.501
I will not let these candles
give their lives in vain.

10:34.534 --> 10:36.103
No wonder people don't like me.

10:36.136 --> 10:38.371
I thought I was beloved.

10:38.405 --> 10:40.473
But I'm be-hated.

10:42.810 --> 10:44.712
Wow.

10:44.745 --> 10:48.115
So, this is where all my shampoo
and pointy tweezers end up.

10:48.148 --> 10:50.383
Yep, this place has everything.
It's the best place to go

10:50.417 --> 10:53.053
if you need face creams,
lotions, suspicious vibrators.

10:53.086 --> 10:54.722
It's where I do
all my Christmas shopping.

10:54.755 --> 10:56.389
Really

10:56.423 --> 10:58.525
Excuse me. Holiday shopping.

10:58.558 --> 10:59.727
No, that wasn't the part
I was...

10:59.760 --> 11:00.994
It doesn't matter.

11:01.028 --> 11:02.896
-Ronnie!
-Chuck, hey.

11:02.930 --> 11:04.965
Uh, hello.
What are you two doing here?

11:04.998 --> 11:07.500
Well, this is my poker game
during delays,

11:07.534 --> 11:10.237
and today I bring Nichole.
She's my pupil.

11:10.270 --> 11:13.206
The best way to learn
is to throw her in water,

11:13.240 --> 11:16.744
like baby you want to teach swim
or to get rid of.

11:16.777 --> 11:18.011
NICHOLE:
I see

11:18.045 --> 11:20.313
your Château Lafite Rothschild

11:20.347 --> 11:23.483
and raise you one gold denture

11:23.516 --> 11:26.219
and one koala snow globe.

11:26.253 --> 11:28.055
Are you betting with contraband?

11:28.088 --> 11:29.389
Doesn't this belong to people?

11:29.422 --> 11:30.858
Yeah, people not smart enough

11:30.891 --> 11:32.359
to hide their things
in their tush.

11:32.392 --> 11:34.561
Actually, some of this stuff
has been tushed.

11:36.263 --> 11:37.731
You want to make a bid
on a pair of Yeezys

11:37.765 --> 11:39.099
I took off
some mouthy sixth grader?

11:39.132 --> 11:40.533
No, actually, um,

11:40.567 --> 11:41.935
we're looking for
a stuffed yellow bear.

11:41.969 --> 11:43.771
I think he might have been left
in security.

11:43.804 --> 11:45.538
Narc?

11:45.572 --> 11:46.673
British.

11:46.706 --> 11:48.108
Well, we can check in the back.

11:49.142 --> 11:50.343
Okay, great.

11:50.377 --> 11:51.879
So, uh, how is this organized?

11:51.912 --> 11:53.747
Is there somewhere
we should look first?

11:55.783 --> 11:58.118
Start with that shelf.
If it's not there,

11:58.151 --> 12:00.720
try all the other shelves.

12:00.754 --> 12:03.423
COLIN:
Oh, my God.

12:03.456 --> 12:05.558
RONNIE:
I know. Pretty cool, right?

12:05.592 --> 12:07.627
No. "Oh, my God,"
this is gonna take forever.

12:07.660 --> 12:10.697
Oh, yeah. That, too.

12:12.732 --> 12:16.169
COLIN: Oh, I better call Alan
to check on Nate.

12:20.740 --> 12:23.210
WOMAN : Flight 237
has been further delayed.

12:23.243 --> 12:25.312
Boarding will now begin
at 3:30 p.m.

12:27.514 --> 12:29.883
The contents of this briefcase

12:29.917 --> 12:32.119
need to be in Los Angeles

12:32.152 --> 12:34.822
by 5:00 p.m.

12:38.258 --> 12:40.727
-I got your nose!

12:40.760 --> 12:42.295
No, I got your nose.

12:45.698 --> 12:48.635
: Oh!

12:50.670 --> 12:52.072
I'm all in.

12:52.105 --> 12:54.975
Yes

12:55.008 --> 12:56.243
A flush?

12:56.276 --> 12:58.111
Kimmy Gibbler's Full House?

13:01.781 --> 13:04.451
-Okay, I fold.
-Yes!

13:04.484 --> 13:07.020
I-I totally bluffed you.
Look, I had nothing.

13:07.054 --> 13:09.022
Most of them
weren't even the same color.

13:09.056 --> 13:10.824
-Damn, Artem, she owned you.
-Making money

13:10.858 --> 13:12.092
with your clothes on is fun.

13:12.125 --> 13:13.626
-No more. I'm done.

13:14.727 --> 13:17.130
I will make like
Christian and "Bale."

13:17.164 --> 13:18.999
Move.

13:21.368 --> 13:22.936
Hey, was Nate's bear
hollowed out

13:22.970 --> 13:24.537
and filled with cocaine,
by any chance?

13:24.571 --> 13:26.606
Hmm. Don't believe so.

13:26.639 --> 13:28.608
Then it's none of these.

13:28.641 --> 13:29.943
This is impossible.

13:29.977 --> 13:31.945
We're never gonna find
a small bear.

13:31.979 --> 13:33.446
It's like trying
to find a needle

13:33.480 --> 13:36.850
in a haystack
full of terrible life choices.

13:36.884 --> 13:38.785
Maybe we're looking at this
the wrong way.

13:38.818 --> 13:42.722
We should be using
all this stuff to help us.

13:42.755 --> 13:43.823
How?

13:43.857 --> 13:45.458
Oh! I think I can see something

13:45.492 --> 13:46.726
on that shelf over there.

13:46.759 --> 13:48.395
-I'm on it.

13:48.428 --> 13:50.430
Oh.

14:01.041 --> 14:02.842
*

14:04.544 --> 14:06.914
-No.

14:10.283 --> 14:12.585
I don't know.
It just seems fun.

14:12.619 --> 14:14.054
Hey, guys!

14:14.087 --> 14:16.189
I think they found the bear
over by A16.

14:24.031 --> 14:25.498
I could use your help.

14:25.532 --> 14:28.001
The smell is getting stronger.

14:28.035 --> 14:30.904
And smarter.

14:30.938 --> 14:33.206
What do you want from us?!

14:35.042 --> 14:37.010
Go, Bernard.

14:37.044 --> 14:38.711
Save yourself.

14:42.215 --> 14:43.383
What are you doing?

14:43.416 --> 14:45.252
I'm gonna let it take me.

14:45.285 --> 14:48.255
I understand now,
I am the smell.

14:48.288 --> 14:51.391
I am the unpleasant thing
pushing people away.

14:51.424 --> 14:53.526
All right. I've had enough.

14:53.560 --> 14:55.762
Get... up.

14:57.430 --> 14:58.865
Here's the truth.

14:58.898 --> 15:00.700
Sometimes you can be
condescending, oblivious

15:00.733 --> 15:02.535
and think you're fancier
than you are.

15:02.569 --> 15:03.971
You're like the sorbet
of people.

15:04.004 --> 15:05.305
At least I'm low-fat.

15:05.338 --> 15:07.374
But it's okay.
You can do what I do.

15:07.407 --> 15:09.709
Be your fiercest self
and not care what people think.

15:09.742 --> 15:13.280
Or... I can be better.

15:13.313 --> 15:16.716
I can be the leader
this airline needs.

15:16.749 --> 15:20.387
Tell me honestly, Bernie.
Do you like me?

15:20.420 --> 15:23.456
I don't hate you, and that's
the most I could like anyone.

15:30.930 --> 15:32.932
Do you want to talk about it?

15:32.966 --> 15:36.236
I've been playing poker
for 40 years,

15:36.269 --> 15:38.738
and in one hour,
you have surpassed me.

15:38.771 --> 15:40.974
Artem is in retrograde.

15:41.008 --> 15:42.642
No, you should feel good.

15:42.675 --> 15:44.111
It means you're a good teacher.

15:44.144 --> 15:47.114
It means that I wasted my life.

15:47.147 --> 15:51.084
All those hours I could have
been with my six daughters.

15:51.118 --> 15:53.586
I live for those beautiful
11 eyes.

15:53.620 --> 15:56.689
Now those eyes
will only see failure.

15:56.723 --> 15:59.926
I think it was just
beginner's luck. I promise.

15:59.959 --> 16:02.595
You know, I bet if we played
again, you'd totally win.

16:02.629 --> 16:06.533
No, I'm like an old greyhound
whose hips have gone bad.

16:06.566 --> 16:09.602
Might as well take me to the
kitchen, cook me for dinner.

16:09.636 --> 16:11.771
Come on, just one more game.
All right?

16:11.804 --> 16:13.640
Winner take all.
Shuffle up and deal.

16:13.673 --> 16:16.643
Okay.

16:16.676 --> 16:19.712
But this time,
we play with chips.

16:19.746 --> 16:22.382
Hold the salsa.

16:22.415 --> 16:24.051
RONNIE: Oh, there's Yellow Bear!
Over there!

16:24.084 --> 16:25.652
-Over there.
-Yellow Bear!

16:25.685 --> 16:26.986
-Sir.
-No.

16:27.020 --> 16:28.655
-ANNETTE: Please.
-RONNIE: A-Annette, that's,

16:28.688 --> 16:30.890
-that's his son's bear. -Step
back. It's out of my hands.

16:30.923 --> 16:32.625
It's been unattended
for too long

16:32.659 --> 16:34.127
and it's marked for elimination.

16:34.161 --> 16:37.430
What does that mean

16:38.698 --> 16:40.133
-WOMAN: Oh, God.

16:40.167 --> 16:41.634
COLIN:
Uh...

16:41.668 --> 16:43.536
Mm-hmm.

16:54.714 --> 16:57.050
I could only find one eye,
but this purple Skittle

16:57.084 --> 16:59.352
will pass
for the other one, right?

16:59.386 --> 17:02.489
Oh, it's okay, Colin.

17:02.522 --> 17:05.258
Yellow Bear is in
a better place now.

17:05.292 --> 17:07.994
Several better places.

17:08.027 --> 17:09.929
I mean, what kind of monster
lets this happen

17:09.962 --> 17:12.199
to his son's favorite toy?

17:12.232 --> 17:15.268
Hey, I... I don't know
much about kids,

17:15.302 --> 17:19.106
but I do know that what's better
than having a yellow bear

17:19.139 --> 17:22.675
is having a dad who's willing

17:22.709 --> 17:26.079
to run all around the airport
trying to find it.

17:26.113 --> 17:28.948
I'm sorry.
I know you're trying to help,

17:28.981 --> 17:31.184
but, um,
I didn't find it in time.

17:31.218 --> 17:33.453
And that's all Nate's
gonna care about.

17:38.391 --> 17:41.361
Oh, you just have a chunk
of his face...

17:41.394 --> 17:43.763
Never mind.

17:50.837 --> 17:52.539
Hey, what's going on?

17:52.572 --> 17:55.642
Nichole's giving Artem one last
chance to win back his money.

17:55.675 --> 17:58.311
With the plane.
What's going on with the plane?

17:58.345 --> 18:00.046
Dave said he could
handle it himself.

18:00.079 --> 18:01.948
I called him sorbet
and he took it very personally.

18:01.981 --> 18:03.082
Don't you call me sorbet?

18:03.116 --> 18:04.684
No, honey, you're sherbet.

18:06.453 --> 18:08.054
I'm going all in.

18:08.087 --> 18:10.089
*

18:16.329 --> 18:17.830
I call.

18:17.864 --> 18:19.031
Okay.

18:20.667 --> 18:23.002
-Trip kings.

18:30.477 --> 18:32.445
You got me.

18:34.113 --> 18:36.115
Looks like the student
has become the student.

18:40.820 --> 18:44.191
Oh, there's my boy.

18:44.224 --> 18:46.226
:
Shh. Daddy.

18:49.829 --> 18:51.063
Where's Yellow Bear?

18:53.900 --> 18:55.835
ARTEM:
Whup.

18:55.868 --> 18:57.036
No, no, no.

18:57.069 --> 18:58.505
I'll get check.

18:58.538 --> 19:02.375
It's the least I can do
since you let me win.

19:02.409 --> 19:04.811
-No, I didn't let you win.
-Whatever you say.

19:04.844 --> 19:07.647
But me and my five daughters,
we appreciate it.

19:07.680 --> 19:10.016
You said you had six daughters.

19:10.049 --> 19:12.319
Did I?

19:12.352 --> 19:13.553
Wha...?

19:13.586 --> 19:16.088
Wait, you said all of that so...

19:17.824 --> 19:20.059
No, but you were so sad.

19:20.092 --> 19:22.829
Well, I can bring sadness
on command.

19:22.862 --> 19:25.665
I've seen many people
being ripped apart by horses.

19:25.698 --> 19:27.834
You may be good at cards,

19:27.867 --> 19:30.737
but you have a lot to learn
about hustling.

19:30.770 --> 19:33.573
Lesson number one, listen.

19:33.606 --> 19:36.343
The game is happening
even if the cards are not out.

19:37.444 --> 19:39.045
So, um,

19:39.078 --> 19:41.348
got to talk to you about, uh,
Yellow Bear.

19:41.381 --> 19:43.916
Um...
How do I put this?

19:43.950 --> 19:46.753
Um, you know how we don't
see Grandma anymore?

19:46.786 --> 19:48.321
-Hey, Nate.
-Well...

19:48.355 --> 19:50.657
So, it turns out,

19:50.690 --> 19:53.660
Yellow Bear got a spot
on Heaven's Olympic team,

19:53.693 --> 19:56.863
but he sent his
very special friend

19:56.896 --> 19:58.765
to keep you company.

19:58.798 --> 20:00.367
And if it's okay,

20:00.400 --> 20:03.069
-he'd like to come and live
with you. -I love him.

20:03.102 --> 20:05.238
I'm gonna call him
Purple Elephant.

20:05.272 --> 20:08.341
Ganz. His name is Ganz Dieter
Ganz, so call him that.

20:08.375 --> 20:09.609
Okay.

20:09.642 --> 20:12.345
He's been around
for a long time,

20:12.379 --> 20:15.615
and he took care of me
through some very tough times,

20:15.648 --> 20:18.451
so I know he will
take good care of you.

20:22.154 --> 20:24.891
That was an incredibly
kind gesture.

20:24.924 --> 20:27.894
I can't imagine how hard
that must have been for you.

20:27.927 --> 20:30.029
Thank you so much.

20:30.062 --> 20:31.564
You know, especially as you
could have just given him

20:31.598 --> 20:33.666
any one of the stuffed animals
from the vault.

20:35.968 --> 20:39.171
Uh-huh. Uh-huh.

20:43.142 --> 20:45.077
-The contents...
-Of this briefcase

20:45.111 --> 20:47.380
will be in Los Angeles
by 5:00 p.m.

20:47.414 --> 20:49.015
Now sit down!

20:50.350 --> 20:52.785
If not, I'll just take
my chances with the cartel.

20:52.819 --> 20:53.986
Great.

20:54.020 --> 20:55.755
-Sorry to bother you.
-Mm-hmm.

20:58.325 --> 21:01.060
Amigos, I owe you an apology.

21:01.093 --> 21:02.795
I haven't been treating you

21:02.829 --> 21:04.230
with the respect
that you deserve.

21:04.263 --> 21:05.498
You're my engines on the ground,

21:05.532 --> 21:07.734
and my behavior
should reflect that.

21:07.767 --> 21:09.802
So, from now on,
I promise you'll be seeing

21:09.836 --> 21:11.671
a whole new Captain Dave.

21:13.940 --> 21:15.508
We appreciate this,

21:15.542 --> 21:17.910
but we're not the guys
who clean your plane.

21:17.944 --> 21:20.079
You think I'm Izzy, don't you?

21:20.112 --> 21:21.514
Uh-huh, okay, in that case,

21:21.548 --> 21:23.015
these aren't
"I'm sorry" pastries,

21:23.049 --> 21:26.285
they're "let's keep this
between us" pastries.

21:29.055 --> 21:31.023
So did you fix it?

21:31.057 --> 21:32.825
I'm oh-for-three
on my apology tour.

21:32.859 --> 21:34.293
Well, the bakery's
out of bear claws.

21:34.327 --> 21:35.795
We're gonna need a new plane.

21:42.802 --> 21:44.737

21:46.739 --> 21:48.841
You've hit the jackpot
with LA to Vegas.

21:48.875 --> 21:51.243
Now here are a few more shows
to check out from Fox.

21:53.880 --> 21:55.448
It's time we fly
this old bird.

21:55.482 --> 21:58.385
* It feels good *

21:58.418 --> 22:01.320
MULDER: I want to believe.
I would just like to see.

22:01.354 --> 22:02.154
I can help you.

22:02.188 --> 22:04.123
* It feels good *

22:04.156 --> 22:05.725
-You want to do
the honors, Alan?
-Yeah!

22:05.758 --> 22:07.126
No, you never
touch this.

22:07.159 --> 22:08.895
* You know it feels good *

22:08.928 --> 22:10.530
-* It feels good *

22:10.563 --> 22:12.499
* Oh, you know it feels good *

22:12.532 --> 22:14.567
Let's do it.

22:14.601 --> 22:16.903
Everything you thought
you knew about medicine
is wrong.

22:20.039 --> 22:20.973
Unbelievable.

22:21.007 --> 22:22.575
* It feels good *
