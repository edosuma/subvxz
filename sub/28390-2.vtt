01:47.839 --> 01:50.639
<font color="#FFFF00"> Is this your girlfriend?</font>

01:50.640 --> 01:51.839
No, she isn't.

01:54.839 --> 01:55.839
<font color="#00FFFF"> You ordered them.</font>

01:55.840 --> 01:57.838
<font color="#00FFFF"> Barry ordered them. </font>Yes.</font>

01:57.839 --> 01:59.838
I'm Peter, Mum.

01:59.839 --> 02:02.838
Barry's in Australia, remember?
Married to Leanne?

02:02.839 --> 02:04.639
Australian Leanne?

02:04.640 --> 02:05.838
<font color="#00FFFF"> Barry's in Littlehampton.</font>

02:05.839 --> 02:07.839
Not for 17 years.

02:08.839 --> 02:11.479
<font color="#00FFFF"> Well, how did he get
all these things here?</font>

02:11.480 --> 02:13.479
He ordered them online in Australia.

02:13.480 --> 02:14.838
He does it every week.

02:14.839 --> 02:16.839
<font color="#00FFFF"> <font color="#FFFF00"> And they fly them here? </font>No, Nan.</font>

<font color="#00FFFF"> I don't want these nappies,
I'm not a baby.</font>

02:20.839 --> 02:22.999
They're pads... for your bed,
to keep 'em dry.

02:23.000 --> 02:25.839
<font color="#FFFF00"> I think I'm going
to go wait in the car.</font>

02:26.839 --> 02:30.838
You wanted one bag of 30,
and Barry's got you 30 packs of 30.

02:30.839 --> 02:33.838
<font color="#00FFFF"> That's very generous of him.</font>
It's a mistake, Mum.

02:33.839 --> 02:35.839
Barry's made another mistake.

02:35.840 --> 02:38.839
<font color="#00FFFF"> So what are you going
to do about it?</font>

02:41.800 --> 02:43.838
Kill Barry, I suppose.

04:35.840 --> 04:39.479
<font color="#FFFF00"> So, are you going to change
the name? </font>Don't know.</font>

04:39.480 --> 04:42.838
A bit of a memorial to him,
I suppose.

04:42.839 --> 04:45.839
<font color="#11FF11"> Bit shit, though... as a memorial.</font>

04:47.839 --> 04:51.799
Do you know what she's told
her employment support worker?

04:51.800 --> 04:52.838
SHE COUGHS

04:52.839 --> 04:55.840
She's looking for opportunities
in international development.

04:57.640 --> 04:58.838
<font color="#FFFF00"> This is bullshit!</font>

04:58.839 --> 05:00.838

Anyway, just as long
as she doesn't poison anyone.

05:19.839 --> 05:21.000

Look, that is not the point, Lech.

07:01.839 --> 07:05.838
Point is, this is a coach,
it's not a house. It's my coach.

07:05.839 --> 07:08.838
I may not own it,
but I'm responsible for it.

07:08.839 --> 07:11.838
I drive it, I take care of it,
and if I damage it,

07:11.839 --> 07:14.838
I have to pay for the damage.

07:14.839 --> 07:15.839
YOU service it.

07:15.840 --> 07:18.838
You don't sleep in it and...

07:18.839 --> 07:20.838
And you don't shower in it.

07:20.839 --> 07:22.839
<font color="#FFFF00"> Yes!</font>

keep you dry, Mrs Green.</font>

10:02.839 --> 10:04.838
Morning, ladies and gents.

10:04.839 --> 10:07.838

<font color="#11FF11"> In future, just allow
a little more time.</font>

25:34.839 --> 25:36.839
I'll let head office know.

25:49.839 --> 25:52.639
Listen, this isn't my vehicle.

25:52.640 --> 25:53.839
It's not mine.

25:54.839 --> 25:57.838
I didn't know you were
in the coach in Calais.

25:57.839 --> 25:59.838
<font color="#FFFF00"> Calais, yes.</font>

25:59.839 --> 26:02.839
Hmm. You... you could get me in
trouble.

26:04.839 --> 26:07.838
So you have to get off now, huh?

26:07.839 --> 26:11.838
I have to take the coach back
to the yard or else they'll,

26:11.839 --> 26:13.999
you know, they'll prosecute me.

26:14.000 --> 26:16.838
So... You understand?

26:16.839 --> 26:19.838
If you need help,
you should go to the police.

26:19.839 --> 26:20.839
Go to the police.

26:20.840 --> 26:22.838
<font color="#FFFF00"> No police, no.</font>

26:22.839 --> 26:26.838
Well, I-I-I can't help you any more.

26:26.839 --> 26:28.838
Huh? I wish I could.

26:28.839 --> 26:30.839
You understand?

26:32.839 --> 26:33.839
Yep.

26:46.839 --> 26:49.838
You'll be OK, huh?

26:49.839 --> 26:51.839
OK?

27:03.839 --> 27:05.839
Wait!

27:06.839 --> 27:08.800
Wait!

27:11.000 --> 27:12.839
Here.

27:23.480 --> 27:25.480
Bollocks.

27:27.480 --> 27:29.480
HE SIGHS

27:30.839 --> 27:32.839
Bollocks.

27:38.839 --> 27:40.839
Oh, bollocks.

27:45.800 --> 27:47.838
Bollocks.

27:47.839 --> 27:49.839
