WEBVTT

01:00.500 --> 01:02.125
I'm so sorry about this.

01:03.625 --> 01:05.291
But I am fixing things, Neb.

01:06.083 --> 01:08.333
Miriam is coming back with the Circulum.

01:09.458 --> 01:12.833
Once you're back too,
and the truth all comes out…

01:18.041 --> 01:19.916
Once we're together again,

01:20.750 --> 01:23.083
she will see
how things are supposed to be.

01:24.500 --> 01:26.041
I will make us a family again.

01:30.250 --> 01:31.458
No matter what it takes.

01:34.958 --> 01:37.666
I don't remember a time
when I wasn't someone's property.

01:47.750 --> 01:50.791
<i>The only mother I ever knew</i>
<i>was the woman who owned me.</i>

01:53.041 --> 01:54.875
<i>She taught me what love meant,</i>

01:55.791 --> 01:59.375
<i>but my twin brother, Neb, was the only one</i>
<i>who ever gave a damn about me.</i>

02:01.250 --> 02:03.791
<i>That bitch put a demon inside him.</i>

02:05.458 --> 02:06.666
<i>I killed my brother.</i>

02:07.333 --> 02:08.291
<i>I killed her.</i>

02:09.291 --> 02:10.208
<i>And I ran.</i>

02:11.708 --> 02:13.208
<i>It was Hira who found me.</i>

02:14.000 --> 02:16.791
<i>She showed me</i>
<i>what love really looked like, but…</i>

02:18.166 --> 02:19.125
<i>it was too much.</i>

02:22.500 --> 02:25.833
<i>Hira left for the Inquisition,</i>
<i>but I was the one running.</i>

02:32.291 --> 02:34.291
I'm not running anymore.

02:35.000 --> 02:37.458
Hira saved me,
and now I'm going to save her.

02:38.125 --> 02:39.125
I have a plan.

02:42.125 --> 02:43.333
-Huh?
-Mm!

02:43.416 --> 02:45.333
-Oh!

02:46.625 --> 02:47.833
Ow. Okay.

02:48.833 --> 02:52.208
I'm so sorry
for everything you went through, Miriam.

02:53.125 --> 02:56.250
There's a reason
the Tevinter flag has a damn snake on it.

02:56.791 --> 03:01.041
Look, you got out,
and good for you for doing it,

03:01.833 --> 03:06.291
but we got the artifact and Hira,
well, she already said leave her behind,

03:06.375 --> 03:07.916
get the artifact to Kirkwall.

03:08.500 --> 03:11.833
Kirkwall? But Fairbanks
said we were going to Orlais.

03:12.625 --> 03:14.833
Fairbanks was a liar and a traitor.

03:15.333 --> 03:16.916
He tried to steal the Circulum.

03:17.000 --> 03:18.000
What?

03:18.833 --> 03:20.250
No. No, no, no.

03:20.333 --> 03:21.958
I-- I worked with him for years.

03:22.041 --> 03:23.166
He was loyal.

03:23.250 --> 03:25.500
I wouldn't count on anyone's loyalties
at this point.

03:26.083 --> 03:30.750
Hey, we all signed on to get that thing
to whatever's left of the Inquisition.

03:31.625 --> 03:34.750
Why not, uh, take it
straight to their main fortress?

03:34.833 --> 03:36.083
Uh, was it Sky something?

03:36.166 --> 03:39.375
What? No. You never meet the buyer
at their stronghold.

03:39.458 --> 03:41.375
That's the fastest way
to lose our payment.

03:41.958 --> 03:44.625
-I don't care about the damn Circulum!

03:45.375 --> 03:49.166
Look, whatever happened,
we all risked our lives for each other,

03:49.708 --> 03:53.666
so I have to believe that we're
at least trying to be decent people.

03:53.750 --> 03:57.166
-Hira is out there right now, suffering,

03:57.250 --> 03:59.750
and I know how to save her,
but I can't do it alone.

04:00.250 --> 04:02.291
I need some decent people.

04:03.041 --> 04:06.541
Anyone who wants to help me
has earned my trust and forgiveness

04:06.625 --> 04:08.875
and gratitude
and whatever they're looking for.

04:10.125 --> 04:13.541
Anyone who wants the Circulum
can take it and go.

04:29.541 --> 04:30.875
I, uh…

04:30.958 --> 04:33.000
I won't say I'm not scared, 'cause I am…

04:33.083 --> 04:35.333
…extremely scared,

04:36.375 --> 04:41.208
but I know this is the right thing to do,
so I'm definitely gonna help you anyway.

04:43.541 --> 04:46.208
You have always been there for me, Miriam.

04:46.875 --> 04:49.541
Think of this as returning the favor.

04:54.083 --> 04:55.958
I just wanted to hear what your plan was,

04:56.041 --> 04:57.375
so I can laugh at it and…

04:57.458 --> 04:59.083
…stuff.

05:02.458 --> 05:03.291
Okay.

05:04.750 --> 05:06.458
But you're not gonna like it.

05:10.375 --> 05:12.583
Frankly, I can't think of much to ask you.

05:13.083 --> 05:15.958
The city's on lockdown,
your friends will be rounded up shortly,

05:16.041 --> 05:18.000
you'll all be executed for theft.

05:18.750 --> 05:23.083
Although it was a pretty good plan.
It nearly worked.

05:23.166 --> 05:26.625
I'd say it worked fine.
You don't have my friends or the artifact.

05:29.250 --> 05:30.708
But I do have you.

05:33.291 --> 05:35.958
Did you even know what you were stealing?

05:36.041 --> 05:39.250
The Circulum Infinitus
isn't just a pretty trinket.

05:39.791 --> 05:42.500
-It's supposed to help people.

05:42.583 --> 05:45.750
No, really, that artifact
can restore the dead,

05:46.250 --> 05:49.541
and we are right on the cusp
of being able to use it.

05:50.500 --> 05:52.666
I don't know what you were paid
or what you were told,

05:52.750 --> 05:56.958
but if we can recover it unscathed,
thousands of people could be restored.

05:57.458 --> 05:59.708
We might be able
to work out a deal for you if--

05:59.791 --> 06:01.708
Thousands of Tevinters, you mean.

06:02.208 --> 06:04.333
But you're a Tevinter.

06:05.333 --> 06:06.166
How do you--

06:06.916 --> 06:07.791
Your necklace.

06:08.500 --> 06:10.708
There's a northern family with that crest.

06:15.791 --> 06:16.875
There was.

06:16.958 --> 06:18.416
So then help me.

06:18.500 --> 06:21.333
That artifact can do
so much good for people like us.

06:21.416 --> 06:22.916
I am nothing like you.

06:23.000 --> 06:25.125
You think I'm just some mercenary?

06:25.208 --> 06:26.958
I knew exactly what that artifact was,

06:27.041 --> 06:30.750
and it's the last thing we need
to make sure all of Tevinter will burn.

06:31.250 --> 06:33.000
"All of Tevinter."

06:33.083 --> 06:34.875
I've heard that phrase before,

06:35.583 --> 06:39.666
but I never thought it'd come from someone
willing to turn on their own nation.

06:40.875 --> 06:43.583
Are you really trying to claim
the high ground?

06:43.666 --> 06:44.666
For the Imperium?

06:45.166 --> 06:48.500
I know <i>exactly</i> what kind of place this is.

06:49.125 --> 06:51.791
My family was the cream of Tevinter once.

06:52.416 --> 06:54.333
Wealthy, influential.

06:55.583 --> 06:57.541
Until we tried to help the people

06:57.625 --> 06:59.750
that people like you enslave.

07:01.375 --> 07:02.958
Then the Venatori found us.

07:03.458 --> 07:05.666
The Venatori are traitors and monsters.

07:07.083 --> 07:08.250
It's hard to believe that

07:08.333 --> 07:11.458
when there are Venatori
inside every corner of the Imperium.

07:16.208 --> 07:17.291
<i>No one stops them.</i>

07:18.000 --> 07:19.500
<i>No one stands up to them.</i>

07:21.666 --> 07:25.000
<i>And since they're the self-proclaimed</i>
<i>protectors of Tevinter,</i>

07:25.500 --> 07:27.583
<i>they decided to make us an example.</i>

07:28.833 --> 07:32.833
<i>They burned my father on our front lawn</i>
<i>as a warning.</i>

07:40.166 --> 07:43.791
<i>No one is above</i>
<i>the traditions of Tevinter.</i>

07:46.208 --> 07:48.416
No one is beyond their reach.

07:50.583 --> 07:51.416
I'm sorry.

07:53.083 --> 07:55.375
Not everyone welcomes the Venatori.

07:56.083 --> 08:00.541
In fact, some of us are working hard
to free the Imperium from their influence,

08:00.625 --> 08:02.791
but stealing this artifact
isn't going to help.

08:02.875 --> 08:03.916
Don't you get it?

08:04.791 --> 08:08.041
-I hate Tevinter.

08:09.166 --> 08:11.416
This place hurt everyone I love,

08:11.500 --> 08:14.333
and I am going to make
all of you pay for it.

08:14.416 --> 08:16.041
The good, the bad,

08:16.125 --> 08:18.458
you <i>all</i> deserve to burn.

08:19.833 --> 08:22.208
I'm done talking to lapdogs.

08:22.291 --> 08:23.125
How dare you?

08:24.458 --> 08:26.000
-I--
-Open this door.

08:28.458 --> 08:31.291
-Magister Ammosine.
-You're dismissed, Commander.

08:31.375 --> 08:33.583
I'm afraid I'm in the middle
of an interrogation.

08:34.833 --> 08:36.250
I said leave.

08:38.500 --> 08:39.833
Yes, sir.

08:45.416 --> 08:47.125
You should know your little doll--

08:50.875 --> 08:53.666
That's for being stupid enough
to think you could steal from me.

08:54.916 --> 08:58.083
I'm not a violent man,
but I must warn you,

08:58.750 --> 09:01.250
the next few hours of your life
are going to be…

09:02.458 --> 09:03.583
…challenging.

09:03.666 --> 09:05.333
I have no pity for thieves.

09:06.666 --> 09:09.583
Your artifact's already gone
and no amount of torture is--

09:10.583 --> 09:12.041
You helped her escape!

09:14.500 --> 09:17.833
-I don't know what you're talking about.
-There's no point in lying.

09:18.333 --> 09:20.708
Miriam came back for you.
You told her to run.

09:20.791 --> 09:22.958
All I want to know is why.

09:24.250 --> 09:25.625
Because I love her.

09:26.833 --> 09:28.500
And she loves me.

09:35.541 --> 09:37.750
You really had me going for a minute.

09:37.833 --> 09:40.916
You don't know
anything about me, Magister.

09:41.708 --> 09:42.666
Oh, I know enough.

09:43.208 --> 09:44.333
Your little gambit failed,

09:44.416 --> 09:46.708
and now you're scrambling
to save yourself,

09:46.791 --> 09:48.625
but it's far too late for that.

09:49.291 --> 09:52.833
Miriam's on her way back as we speak
with the Circulum,

09:52.916 --> 09:54.375
and when she gets here,

09:54.458 --> 09:58.166
I'm going to march you up onto the gallows
and pull the lever myself.

09:58.250 --> 09:59.916
Miriam would never forgive you.

10:00.500 --> 10:01.500
Oh?

10:01.583 --> 10:02.416
Are you sure?

10:03.625 --> 10:07.583
Because I think,
once everything is out in the open,

10:08.958 --> 10:10.166
she's going to thank me.

10:11.458 --> 10:14.083
Sir, the slave woman's
outside the gates.

10:15.833 --> 10:17.583
She's only back for revenge.

10:18.375 --> 10:19.208
Neb…

10:21.541 --> 10:24.000
bring our sister and the Circulum to me.

10:25.750 --> 10:26.583
And, Neb…

10:34.083 --> 10:35.958
Only if she doesn't cooperate.

11:01.958 --> 11:03.333
He sent you away too, huh?

11:04.916 --> 11:07.291
I don't know why I'm surprised.

11:07.375 --> 11:10.166
It's not the only stupid thing
he's done lately.

11:13.708 --> 11:17.333
It's the Circulum.
It's changed him somehow.

11:18.208 --> 11:19.958
I'm worried.

11:22.375 --> 11:24.041
I hope I'm not the only one.

11:29.375 --> 11:30.208
Wait.

11:32.916 --> 11:34.458
Where are the others?

11:44.041 --> 11:46.333
So, uh, I've been thinking, Rolls…

11:46.416 --> 11:47.458
Yeah?

11:47.541 --> 11:50.416
If we, you know-- we both get out of this…

11:50.500 --> 11:51.458
Yeah?

11:52.083 --> 11:55.333
We should ask for a bigger cut.
Some kind of hazard pay or something.

11:55.416 --> 11:56.541
Yeah.

12:00.000 --> 12:01.833
-Um, duck, please.

12:17.541 --> 12:18.791
You all, with me!

12:18.875 --> 12:21.416
The rest of you, put that elf in custody.

12:22.500 --> 12:24.041
I'm done with surprises.

12:27.041 --> 12:29.166
You heard the commander.
Let's go--

13:35.125 --> 13:36.416
You're not my brother,

13:37.708 --> 13:40.750
and I'll be damned
if I'm gonna let you use him anymore!

13:44.458 --> 13:46.875
-What is she doing out there?

13:48.500 --> 13:49.625
Rescuing me.

13:51.125 --> 13:53.166
I guess she's not afraid of you anymore.

13:53.250 --> 13:55.250
She doesn't have anything to be afraid of.

13:55.333 --> 13:58.375
-All I asked was for the Circulum and--

13:58.458 --> 14:00.416
You think she trusts you?

14:00.500 --> 14:01.958
Rezaren Ammosine?

14:02.541 --> 14:06.041
Are you really the last one
to figure out that you're the villain?

14:06.125 --> 14:09.875
Believe me, no matter how hopeless
her mission may be,

14:09.958 --> 14:12.916
the Circulum is somewhere
you will never find it.

14:48.416 --> 14:51.083
Arrest the dwarf.
I'll deal with the Orlesian.

15:00.041 --> 15:01.625
This is it. Go!

15:05.000 --> 15:07.166
Is that all you got? Come on!

15:17.125 --> 15:18.208
Neb protected me.

15:19.666 --> 15:21.333
He defended me.

15:22.833 --> 15:24.750
He was my only brother!

15:30.125 --> 15:31.541
He was everything to me.

15:46.166 --> 15:48.708
And you're not him.
You're not.

15:49.958 --> 15:51.958
You're not him!

15:58.125 --> 15:58.958
Neb?

16:14.916 --> 16:16.291
Oh, come on. Come on!

16:24.291 --> 16:25.916
You gonna tell anyone I'm here?

16:28.625 --> 16:30.708
Can you point me toward the throne room?

16:33.125 --> 16:35.166
Hey, look at you, making good choices.

16:35.250 --> 16:37.666
Now I need to stop my friends from dying.

16:37.750 --> 16:41.500
You should probably run away from here
and tell the other elves to do the same.

16:41.583 --> 16:42.416
Okay?

17:03.125 --> 17:03.958
Ugh!

17:11.083 --> 17:12.500
You're holding it wrong.

17:13.041 --> 17:15.833
-Fine. Take it!

17:47.625 --> 17:51.708
All right, human, let's not do
anything rash. What do you want?

17:52.875 --> 17:55.500
Throw down your weapon
and give me some answers.

17:55.583 --> 17:57.916
Lacklon, no. You--

18:00.541 --> 18:02.208
Who is your employer?

18:02.291 --> 18:06.083
What does the Circulum do that makes it
such a threat to Tevinter and…

18:07.541 --> 18:09.041
Where's the Qunari?

18:17.416 --> 18:18.666
-Ha-ha!

18:18.750 --> 18:19.583
Huh?

18:21.583 --> 18:23.166
-Oh, shit.

18:23.250 --> 18:24.083
Shit!

18:35.958 --> 18:38.166
You've got longer legs. Go! Go!

18:48.791 --> 18:51.416
Bastard. I'm not taking you anywhere!

18:52.041 --> 18:55.375
Should've thought of that before
bragging you knew where the Circulum was.

18:55.958 --> 18:57.375
Now you get to prove it.

19:05.666 --> 19:06.791
What?

19:45.666 --> 19:47.458
Okay, almost there, almost there.

19:47.541 --> 19:48.541
And…

20:52.000 --> 20:52.875
I'm sorry.

21:54.083 --> 21:55.625
No one ever saves us.

21:56.125 --> 21:57.666
So we save us.

21:58.500 --> 21:59.333
Now go.
