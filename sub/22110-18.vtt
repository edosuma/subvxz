"millennials."

A millennial can be defined

01:04.602 --> 01:08.301
as anyone born
between 1982 and 2000.

01:08.345 --> 01:11.783
Or anyone who thinks loving
sriracha or Austin, Texas,

01:11.826 --> 01:13.959
counts as a personality.

01:14.002 --> 01:15.700
Millennials crave things like:

01:15.743 --> 01:17.049
instant gratification,

01:17.093 --> 01:18.616
authentic experiences,

01:18.659 --> 01:20.966

we haven't figured out yet,

01:21.009 --> 01:22.750

who has a parakeet

01:25.057 --> 01:28.016

she identifies as a man,

to notthank you for hiring me,

good things to happen to me

a list of my trigger warnings.

02:15.890 --> 02:17.196

02:17.240 --> 02:19.546
Actually, brah, asking me
what a trigger warning is

02:19.590 --> 02:21.200
is one of my triggers, brah.

is horrifying, brah.

Now, if we want to get
some social media attention,

02:38.957 --> 02:40.915
we got to start
with a group selfie.

02:40.959 --> 02:44.310

I feel like I know better
than everyone else!

That's because anytime
someone walks through a cloud

04:01.474 --> 04:03.650

a millennial is born.

the Six Second Talk Show.

10:37.870 --> 10:39.176
My guest tonight is Joe Biden.

10:39.219 --> 10:41.831
And that's all the time we have.
Thanks for watching. Good night.

10:41.874 --> 10:43.659
-How was that?
-Eh, it kind of dragged.

10:44.616 --> 10:46.139
Well, Congress is at it again.

Welcome to
The Six Second Talk Show.

10:59.892 --> 11:02.895

to thank our musical guest,

11:04.897 --> 11:05.898
Barenaked Ladies. Good night.

11:09.249 --> 11:10.860
Peter, I can't believe
your talk show

11:10.903 --> 11:12.862
is such a huge hit
for the brewery.

11:12.905 --> 11:16.343
And thanks to that, I'm now
a huge social media star.

11:19.042 --> 11:21.000
Oh, my God,
what the hell is that?

11:21.044 --> 11:22.088
Hello, Griffin family.

11:22.132 --> 11:24.656
I'm coming to you live,

11:24.700 --> 11:27.180
I'm Parker Stanton, CEO of Boop,

Look, Peter, the reason I'm here

11:36.059 --> 11:37.887
is because
of your Six Second Talk Show.

11:37.930 --> 11:39.410
Now, I haven't had
the time to watch it,

11:39.453 --> 11:41.586
but I hear it's the buzz
of Silicon Valley.

11:41.629 --> 11:44.110
I want you and your family
to visit us here as my guests,

11:44.154 --> 11:46.417
so I can find out
what the next big thing is.

11:46.460 --> 11:47.810
Oh, I-I got lots of ideas.

11:47.853 --> 11:51.204
I've been working on something
called "Look At It, Kick It."

11:59.952 --> 12:02.650
See you in Silicon Valley.

12:02.694 --> 12:03.826
Oh, this is exciting.

12:03.869 --> 12:05.262
A family trip.

12:05.305 --> 12:06.872
Yeah, I love traveling.

12:06.916 --> 12:08.918
Oh, except that trip to Europe
where we spent most of our time

12:08.961 --> 12:11.268
trying to refold our map.

12:11.311 --> 12:13.270
All right, the museum
is that way,

12:13.313 --> 12:15.315
so let's fold the map and go.

12:19.450 --> 12:21.931
Okay, couple more folds...

12:21.974 --> 12:23.671
Nope, okay, wrong end.

12:23.715 --> 12:24.847
Now, let's see...

12:24.890 --> 12:26.500
Nope, nope, that's wrong...

12:26.544 --> 12:27.806
Find the corners.

12:27.850 --> 12:28.807
It's not a puzzle, Chris.

12:28.851 --> 12:30.722
Y-You got to fold
on the creases.

12:30.766 --> 12:31.854
I'd be able to find the creases

12:31.897 --> 12:34.073
if somebody had folded it
correctly last time.

12:34.117 --> 12:35.727
I did fold it correctly.

12:35.771 --> 12:37.860
Nope, you didn't, and then
you jammed it into a backpack

12:37.903 --> 12:38.991
and now I'm in this mess.

12:39.035 --> 12:40.819
Don't blame me, you ripped it up

12:40.863 --> 12:43.039
when you were tearing through
the backpack for your snacks.

12:43.082 --> 12:45.215
Okay, this is why I wanted
to bring a globe, all right?

12:45.258 --> 12:46.651
You don't have to fold a globe.

12:46.694 --> 12:49.523
Who the hell would bring
a globe on vacation?

12:49.567 --> 12:51.090
See, Bon? We're eating food,

12:51.134 --> 12:53.310
and they're tearing
each other apart.

13:01.579 --> 13:03.015

Yep. Are-are

Yeah, but...

I was yelling at him.

we would bump into each other

at a small cafe in Rome and
reminisce about this moment.

you do it

19:15.126 --> 19:16.606
I've done that before. It works.

19:16.649 --> 19:18.216
[gasp] Chris, that's brilliant.

19:18.260 --> 19:20.479
We just need a big bag
and a lot of rice.

19:20.523 --> 19:22.046
You sure that's gonna work?

19:22.089 --> 19:23.308
Eh, worth a shot.

19:23.352 --> 19:24.614
We'll just have to roll up
our sleeves

19:24.657 --> 19:26.137
and do the best we can,

19:26.181 --> 19:28.574
like the men
who built New York City.

19:28.618 --> 19:32.317
Men, creating an entire
subway system out of nothing

19:32.361 --> 19:35.364
is grueling, thankless,
life-threatening work.

19:35.407 --> 19:37.366
But just remember:
we're doing this

19:37.409 --> 19:40.499
so that one day,
future commuters can be hassled

19:40.543 --> 19:43.285
by panhandlers
and amateur break-dancers.

19:43.328 --> 19:45.504
What about public masturbators?

19:45.548 --> 19:47.506
Especially public masturbators.

19:47.550 --> 19:50.161
Now, let's go die underground!

19:50.205 --> 19:52.294
[workers cheering]

19:58.343 --> 20:00.737
Look, we're getting a signal.

20:00.780 --> 20:02.260
I think we fixed the Internet.

20:02.304 --> 20:03.522
Something's coming through.

20:03.566 --> 20:04.741
It looks like an ad.

20:04.784 --> 20:07.613
"Smithwick's
Artisinal Pretzels."

20:07.657 --> 20:10.137
Son of a bitch!

20:15.317 --> 20:17.754
Well, I'm glad
you got the Internet...

20:17.797 --> 20:20.147
H-Hold on.

20:20.191 --> 20:21.975
I'm sorry,
what-what were you saying?

20:22.019 --> 20:23.455
Yeah, sounds good.

20:23.499 --> 20:26.197
And send.

20:26.241 --> 20:29.026
Take that, Delta Air Lines.

20:40.342 --> 20:42.082
Submitted for your approval:

20:42.126 --> 20:45.434
a restaurant full of people
so distracted by their phones

20:45.477 --> 20:48.350
they're unaware that they're all
about to go up in smoke,

20:48.393 --> 20:51.004
just like
the Fox Tuesday night lineup.

20:51.048 --> 20:53.050
[repeated shouting and laughing]
