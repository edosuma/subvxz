WEBVTT

00:01.867 --> 00:05.000
[Debra and Ray laughing]

00:07.100 --> 00:08.167
- OH!
- WHOA!

00:08.167 --> 00:10.600
[loud thud]
- OW!

00:10.600 --> 00:14.567
- OH...OH...

00:14.567 --> 00:15.767
OHH, SORRY.

00:15.767 --> 00:19.267
THOUGHT I HAD
A LITTLE MORE BED UP THERE.

00:19.267 --> 00:20.600
- NO, HEY, RAY, STOP!

00:20.600 --> 00:21.533
- WHAT?

00:21.533 --> 00:23.167
- I REALLY HURT
MY SHOULDER.

00:23.167 --> 00:25.100
- OH, WELL,
CAN'T YOU JUST SHAKE IT OFF?

00:25.100 --> 00:26.833
- WELL, NO.

00:26.833 --> 00:28.167
NO, IT REALLY HURTS.

00:28.167 --> 00:30.133
I THINK I BETTER
PUT SOME ICE ON IT.

00:30.133 --> 00:31.367
- WELL, YOU KNOW,
MY WRIST HURTS,

00:31.367 --> 00:32.733
BUT YOU KNOW WHAT THEY SAY.

00:32.733 --> 00:35.933
YOU SHOULD GET
RIGHT BACK UP ON THE HORSE.

00:35.933 --> 00:38.533
- I'M GETTING ICE.

00:40.667 --> 00:43.000
- BUT THE HORSE!

00:46.000 --> 00:48.233
OW...

00:48.233 --> 00:51.333
MY FIRST SEX INJURY.

00:52.933 --> 00:58.600
male announcer: ANOTHER SEASON
OF "EVERYBODY LOVES RAYMOND."

00:58.600 --> 00:59.767
[grunting]

00:59.767 --> 01:04.900
[slow motion yelling, grunting]

01:04.900 --> 01:10.167
[determined music]

01:10.167 --> 01:12.567
- [laughs]

01:12.567 --> 01:15.500
[grunting]

01:27.933 --> 01:31.067
[crowd cheering]

01:40.233 --> 01:43.367
- OH! AAH! GOD.

01:49.267 --> 01:52.400
AH, OOH! MAN.

01:55.933 --> 01:59.100
HEY, GIANNI,
PASS ME THAT SODA.

01:59.100 --> 02:02.100
OH! AAH! JEEZ.

02:02.100 --> 02:03.933
AAH, GOD.

02:03.933 --> 02:05.300
MAN, I HURT MY WRIST.

02:05.300 --> 02:07.433
I REALLY HURT THAT WRIST,
DIDN'T I?

02:07.433 --> 02:10.133
- WHAT, DID YOU SPRAIN IT
OPENING A JAR OF MARMALADE?

02:10.133 --> 02:11.633
- [chuckles]

02:11.633 --> 02:14.633
- HOW 'BOUT
JUST THE OPPOSITE?

02:18.833 --> 02:24.133
DEBRA AND I
HAD SOME WILD SEX LAST NIGHT.

02:25.067 --> 02:27.067
- WHOA!
- ALL RIGHT.

02:27.067 --> 02:30.800
- OH, WHOOP-DE-DOO FOR YOU.

02:30.800 --> 02:32.167
- SO WHAT HAPPENED?

02:32.167 --> 02:33.800
- WELL, NO, NO, NO.

02:33.800 --> 02:35.867
I DON'T NEED TO TALK ABOUT IT,
ALL RIGHT?

02:35.867 --> 02:37.367
- OH, WOULD YOU STOP?

02:37.367 --> 02:39.600
YOU BROUGHT IT UP.
YOU GOT A PHONY BANDAGE ON.

02:39.600 --> 02:44.067
YOU CAN'T WAIT TO TELL
EVERYBODY EVERYTHING.

02:44.067 --> 02:45.900
- TELL ME ANYTHING.

02:45.900 --> 02:46.967
- NO! NO, NO.

02:46.967 --> 02:48.400
- OH, THIS ISN'T FAIR!

02:48.400 --> 02:50.600
I HAVEN'T HAD SEX
SINCE MY KID WAS BORN.

02:50.600 --> 02:53.900
- YOUR KID'S
A YEAR AND A HALF.

02:53.900 --> 02:56.800
- TELL ME YOUR STORY.

02:56.800 --> 03:01.200
- ALL RIGHT.
ALL RIGHT.

03:01.200 --> 03:03.067
YOU KNOW,
THINGS WERE HAPPENING,

03:03.067 --> 03:04.700
AND IT GOT A LITTLE CRAZY,

03:04.700 --> 03:08.833
AND NEXT THING I KNOW,
WE'RE AIRBORNE.

03:08.833 --> 03:11.333
- WHOO.

03:11.333 --> 03:16.133
- LONG STORY SHORT,
THIS WAS NO MARMALADE ACCIDENT.

03:16.133 --> 03:17.567
- THAT WILL NEVER
HAPPEN TO ME.

03:17.567 --> 03:21.333
- NO KIDDING.

03:21.333 --> 03:23.567
- HEY, SHE'S HURT WORSE THAN ME.

03:23.567 --> 03:27.400
- SO YOU'RE PROUD OF THE FACT
THAT YOU'RE SUCH A KLUTZ,

03:27.400 --> 03:31.600
YOU FELL OUT OF BED
ONTO YOUR POOR PETITE WIFE.

03:31.600 --> 03:34.467
- I CAN HONESTLY SAY
THIS WAS NOT MY FAULT.

03:34.467 --> 03:39.533
THE LADY GOT A LITTLE BIT
OUT OF CONTROL.

03:39.533 --> 03:40.367
- REALLY?

03:40.367 --> 03:41.567
YOU KNOW, I GOT TO TELL YOU,

03:41.567 --> 03:43.933
I ALWAYS THOUGHT
THAT ABOUT DEBRA.

03:43.933 --> 03:45.633
- WHAT?

03:45.633 --> 03:46.800
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

03:46.800 --> 03:48.767
WHAT--WHAT ARE YOU THINKING
ABOUT DEBRA?

03:48.767 --> 03:50.900
- YEAH, I CAN SEE THAT.

03:50.900 --> 03:53.767
SHE SEEMS TO BE VERY, UH...

03:53.767 --> 03:56.633
"ANIMALE."

03:58.200 --> 04:00.733
- ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT,
A LITTLE RESPECT.

04:00.733 --> 04:02.533
IS THIS HOW YOU TALK
ABOUT YOUR WIFE?

04:02.533 --> 04:05.367
I GUESS THEY'RE JUST HANDING
OUT WIVES TO ANYBODY, HUH?

04:05.367 --> 04:08.133
[muttering angrily]

04:09.767 --> 04:12.533
- HEY, SO YOU REALLY
THOUGHT THAT ABOUT DEBRA?

04:12.533 --> 04:14.067
- YEAH,
SHE'S LIKE ONE OF THOSE

04:14.067 --> 04:16.133
"UPTIGHT AND BOSSY
ON THE SURFACE

04:16.133 --> 04:19.067
BUT WILD UNDERNEATH" GIRLS.

04:19.067 --> 04:20.133
- WELL, I'M UPTIGHT.

04:20.133 --> 04:24.067
YOU THINK I'M WILD UNDERNEATH?

04:24.067 --> 04:27.167
- I'D HATE TO BE UNDERNEATH.

04:32.300 --> 04:34.167
- HEY, YOU KNOW, YOU GUYS
SHOULD KNOW ABOUT DEBRA,

04:34.167 --> 04:37.133
SHE WASN'T ALWAYS--SHE WASN'T
ALWAYS LIKE THIS, YOU KNOW?

04:37.133 --> 04:41.633
BUT I GUESS OVER THE YEARS,
I'VE KIND OF CREATED A MONSTER.

04:41.633 --> 04:43.067
[laughing]

04:43.067 --> 04:44.200
- TURN UP THE TV.

04:44.200 --> 04:45.567
I'M COMING BACK,

04:45.567 --> 04:48.433
AND I'LL BE EATING
SOMETHING CRUNCHY.

04:49.667 --> 04:50.933
- ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT.

04:50.933 --> 04:53.667
JUST SHUT UP NOW ABOUT
THE BOOM-BA-DEE-BOOM-BOOM.

04:53.667 --> 04:55.367
- COME ON, YOUR OLD MAN
WOULD BE PROUD OF YOU.

04:55.367 --> 04:56.800
YOU WERE TAKING CARE
OF BUSINESS.

04:56.800 --> 04:58.367
- EVERY WAY.

04:58.367 --> 05:00.500
- NOW, JUST LOOK, WE DON'T TALK
ABOUT THAT, ALL RIGHT?

05:00.500 --> 05:03.100
WHAT'S WRONG WITH YOU GUYS?
HAVE A LITTLE CLASS, MAN.

05:03.100 --> 05:05.067
- DAD,
THOSE NACHOS WERE FOR ME.

05:05.067 --> 05:06.100
- I LIKE CHEESE.

05:06.100 --> 05:09.833
YOU KNEW THE RISKS.

05:09.833 --> 05:12.067
- HEY, FRANK, RAY HURT HIMSELF.

05:12.067 --> 05:13.067
ASK HIM HOW.

05:13.067 --> 05:15.433
- BERNIE.

05:15.433 --> 05:16.367
- WHY?

05:16.367 --> 05:18.133
- YEAH, NEVER MIND.

05:18.133 --> 05:20.167
- NO, NO, NO, IT'S A GOOD STORY.
ASK HIM.

05:20.167 --> 05:23.133
- ALL RIGHT. GO AHEAD.

05:26.167 --> 05:28.100
- WHAT? IT'S NOTHIN'.

05:28.100 --> 05:30.700
I HURT MY WRIST,
THAT'S ALL.

05:32.067 --> 05:33.867
I FELL DOWN THE STAIRS.

05:33.867 --> 05:36.967
THEY'RE OLD, AND THEY'RE CREAKY,
THOSE STAIRS.

05:36.967 --> 05:41.133
- WHAT A MARVELOUS STORY.

05:41.133 --> 05:43.467
AND YOU TELL IT BEAUTIFULLY.

05:43.467 --> 05:46.133
- I TOLD YOU IT WAS NOTHING.

05:46.133 --> 05:47.567
- HOW MANY YEARS
HAVE I GOT LEFT?

05:47.567 --> 05:50.667
YOU GOT TO WASTE MY TIME
WITH THAT STORY?

05:50.667 --> 05:53.067
- WHAT? I DIDN'T WANT
TO TELL IT TO YOU.

05:53.067 --> 05:54.633
- THEN YOU SHOULD
CUT YOUR LOSSES NOW

05:54.633 --> 05:56.200
AND STOP TALKING.

05:56.200 --> 05:59.067
A STAIR STORY.

06:00.333 --> 06:02.100
- DEBRA FELL, TOO.

06:02.100 --> 06:04.267
- HEY, WOULD YOU SHUT UP?

06:04.267 --> 06:06.567
ALL RIGHT?
JUST SHUT UP!

06:06.567 --> 06:08.133
WHAT ARE YOU BOTHERING
MY FATHER FOR?

06:08.133 --> 06:09.467
HE'S WATCHING THE GAME,

06:09.467 --> 06:12.300
AND HE TOLD ME
HE DOESN'T LIKE YOU.

06:12.300 --> 06:14.233
- TWO PEOPLE FALLING.

06:14.233 --> 06:16.800
NOW MAYBE YOU GOT A STORY.

06:16.800 --> 06:18.367
HOW'D THAT HAPPEN?

06:18.367 --> 06:22.433
- YES, HOW?
PRAY TELL.

06:22.433 --> 06:26.333
- SAME THING.
THOSE CRAZY-ASS STAIRS THERE.

06:26.333 --> 06:29.600
SO IF YOU SEE DEBRA LATER
AND SHE HAS A SORE SHOULDER,

06:29.600 --> 06:30.833
THEN THAT'S WHY.

06:30.833 --> 06:33.800
- I DON'T UNDERSTAND
HOW TWO GROWN PEOPLE

06:33.800 --> 06:36.400
FALL DOWN THE STAIRS.

06:36.400 --> 06:38.067
- BECAUSE IT WASN'T OUR FAULT.

06:38.067 --> 06:44.067
THOSE STUPID STAIRS--
THEY'RE DANGEROUS, I TELL YOU.

06:45.800 --> 06:49.067
- SO DID YOU REALLY
FALL DOWN THE STAIRS?

06:49.067 --> 06:50.067
WHICH STORY'S TRUE?

06:50.067 --> 06:51.333
- WOULD YOU SHUT UP?

06:51.333 --> 06:52.800
- NO, NO, REALLY,
I'M CONFUSED,

06:52.800 --> 06:55.633
BECAUSE THEY'RE BOTH
QUITE CONVINCING.

06:58.067 --> 06:59.100
[kids yelling]

06:59.100 --> 07:02.467
- ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT.

07:02.467 --> 07:03.967
WHOO.

07:03.967 --> 07:05.433
- ALL RIGHT.

07:05.433 --> 07:09.300
I AM LAYING DOWN NOW
AND SCRATCHING A FEW THINGS.

07:12.233 --> 07:14.167
- FRANK,
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

07:14.167 --> 07:16.100
- I CAME OVER
TO CHECK OUT YOUR STAIRS.

07:16.100 --> 07:17.933
NO WONDER
THE TWO OF YOU FELL.

07:17.933 --> 07:19.300
THESE LOOK WARPED.

07:19.300 --> 07:20.733
- WHAT ARE YOU TALKING--

07:20.733 --> 07:23.233
- YOU KNOW WHAT?
LET'S JUST LEAVE HIM ALONE.

07:23.233 --> 07:24.600
THIS IS WHO HE IS.

07:24.600 --> 07:26.600
THIS IS HOW HE DEFINES HIMSELF
AS A PERSON.

07:26.600 --> 07:28.333
- BUT WHY IS YOUR FATHER
FIXING OUR STAIRS?

07:28.333 --> 07:30.167
- WHO CARES?
THE FUDGE POPS ARE MELTING.

07:30.167 --> 07:31.467
LET'S GO.
COME ON.

07:31.467 --> 07:32.900
- WAIT A MINUTE.

07:32.900 --> 07:37.067
WHY DOES YOUR FATHER THINK
THAT WE FELL DOWN THE STAIRS?

07:37.067 --> 07:38.467
- BECAUSE
THAT'S WHAT I TOLD HIM.

07:38.467 --> 07:40.067
YOU DON'T WANT HIM
KNOWING THE TRUTH, DO YOU?

07:40.067 --> 07:43.067
HE CAME IN THE OTHER NIGHT,
I WAS TALKING TO THE GUYS AND--

07:43.067 --> 07:47.267
- WAIT A MINUTE.
WAIT A MINUTE!

07:47.267 --> 07:49.833
DID YOU TELL THE GUYS?

07:49.833 --> 07:52.300
- UH...

07:54.067 --> 07:58.133
THEY GUESSED.

07:58.133 --> 08:00.267
- YOU TOLD YOUR FRIENDS

08:00.267 --> 08:01.933
ABOUT HOW WE FELL
OUT OF THE BED?

08:01.933 --> 08:04.200
- NO, THEY JUST GOT IT.

08:04.200 --> 08:06.733
MY WRIST, YOUR SHOULDER...

08:06.733 --> 08:09.300
IT IS KIND OF OBVIOUS.

08:09.300 --> 08:12.067
- OH, MY GOD, RAY,
THIS IS SO EMBARRASSING.

08:12.067 --> 08:14.067
HOW COULD YOU?

08:14.067 --> 08:15.933
- IT'S GUY TALK.

08:15.933 --> 08:18.733
COME ON, THAT'S WHAT WE DO.
HEY, DON'T BE EMBARRASSED.

08:18.733 --> 08:21.367
WE'RE "MUY CALIENTE"!

08:21.367 --> 08:24.267
- YEAH.

08:24.267 --> 08:26.200
AND EVERYONE KNOWS IT.

08:26.200 --> 08:28.067
- ALL RIGHT!

08:28.067 --> 08:29.600
- I DON'T WANT EVERYONE
TO KNOW IT, RAY!

08:29.600 --> 08:31.533
- COME ON, LOOK,
THE GUYS ALREADY THINK

08:31.533 --> 08:33.767
YOU'RE WILD AND STUFF ANYWAY,
SO IT DOESN'T MATTER.

08:33.767 --> 08:37.400
- WELL, I DON'T THINK...

08:37.400 --> 08:39.067
WILD?

08:39.067 --> 08:41.800
REALLY?

08:41.800 --> 08:44.767
- "ANIMALE."

08:47.700 --> 08:49.767
- REALLY?
THEY THINK I'M WILD?

08:49.767 --> 08:52.100
- YEAH, SEE, SEE! YOU LIKE IT.
EVERYTHING IS FINE.

08:52.100 --> 08:53.733
- NO, NO, IT IS NOT FINE.

08:53.733 --> 08:56.500
NO, BECAUSE YOU'RE NOT SUPPOSED
TO BE TALKING ABOUT THAT.

08:56.500 --> 08:58.300
AND THEN YOU HAVE
TO MAKE UP THIS WHOLE THING

08:58.300 --> 08:59.733
ABOUT THE STAIRS,

08:59.733 --> 09:01.367
AND NOW YOUR FATHER'S
RIPPING 'EM OUT!

09:01.367 --> 09:03.400
HOW ARE WE GONNA GET UP
THE STAIRS?

09:03.400 --> 09:07.800
- LOOK AT YOUR EYES RIGHT NOW.
YOU ARE A LITTLE WILD.

09:07.800 --> 09:08.933
RAWRRR.

09:08.933 --> 09:11.267
- OH, GET AWAY FROM ME.

09:11.267 --> 09:13.500
- HELLO, DEARS.
- HI, MARIE.

09:13.500 --> 09:16.067
- FRANK WANTED SOME ICE WATER.

09:16.067 --> 09:17.367
- BELIEVE IT OR NOT, MARIE,

09:17.367 --> 09:19.867
WE HAVE THE INGREDIENTS
FOR THAT RIGHT HERE.

09:19.867 --> 09:22.233
- OH, I KNOW,

09:22.233 --> 09:25.967
BUT FRANK LIKES HIS ICE CUBES
A LITTLE LESS MURKY.

09:25.967 --> 09:27.400
- ALL RIGHT.

09:27.400 --> 09:31.133
- OH, I HEARD ABOUT YOU
FALLING DOWN THE STAIRS!

09:31.133 --> 09:34.233
SOUNDS TERRIBLE.
ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?

09:34.233 --> 09:35.467
- YEAH, WE'RE FINE,
MARIE.

09:35.467 --> 09:38.333
- MY WRIST IS A LITTLE SORE.
- RAY.

09:38.333 --> 09:40.467
- YOU POOR THING.
- YEAH, YEAH.

09:40.467 --> 09:45.200
- BUT WHAT I DON'T UNDERSTAND
IS, HOW DID YOU BOTH FALL?

09:45.200 --> 09:48.700
WERE YOU GOING DOWN THE STAIRS
AT THE SAME TIME?

09:48.700 --> 09:50.233
- YES, WE WERE.

09:50.233 --> 09:54.767
THAT IS, INDEED,
WHAT WE DID DO.

09:54.767 --> 09:56.567
- BUT WHY?

09:56.567 --> 09:57.833
- I DON'T KNOW.

09:57.833 --> 10:03.033
IT WAS KIND OF LIKE
A JACK-AND-JILL SITUATION.

10:03.033 --> 10:05.733
I WENT, AND THEN SHE,
YOU KNOW...

10:05.733 --> 10:10.267
CAME TUMBLING AFTER.

10:10.267 --> 10:12.167
- I DON'T UNDERSTAND.

10:12.167 --> 10:13.600
- WELL,
THERE'S NO SHAME IN THAT.

10:13.600 --> 10:15.467
WE ALL GET OLD.

10:23.633 --> 10:25.133
- WE WERE HAVING A RACE.

10:25.133 --> 10:26.500
- HUH?

10:26.500 --> 10:29.533
- A RACE?
IN THE HOUSE?

10:29.533 --> 10:33.300
- YEAH, MM-HMM.

10:33.300 --> 10:35.867
- SOMETHING DOESN'T MAKE SENSE.

10:35.867 --> 10:37.333
- WELL, IT DOESN'T HAVE TO.

10:37.333 --> 10:41.167
IT'S A TRADITION.

10:41.167 --> 10:42.933
- A TRADITION.

10:42.933 --> 10:45.100
WELL, I NEVER HEARD
ANYTHING ABOUT THESE RACES.

10:45.100 --> 10:47.333
- WELL, IT'S--JUST IT'S KIND OF
OUR THING, YOU KNOW?

10:47.333 --> 10:48.800
I MEAN, WE DO IT ALL THE TIME.

10:48.800 --> 10:51.800
SOMETIMES WE DO FRONT DOOR
TO BACK DOOR, YOU KNOW?

10:51.800 --> 10:54.233
YEAH, SOMETIMES WE DO
THREE TIMES AROUND THE COUCH.

10:54.233 --> 10:55.800
FRIDAY
WE USUALLY DO THE STAIRS.

10:55.800 --> 10:57.333
- OKAY, RAY.

10:57.333 --> 11:00.500
- "FRIDAY ON THE STAIRS"--
THAT'S WHAT WE CALL IT.

11:03.733 --> 11:04.933
[pounding, hammering]

11:04.933 --> 11:06.767
- FRANK MUST BE
AWFULLY THIRSTY BY NOW.

11:06.767 --> 11:08.067
- YEAH, OH, YOU KNOW WHAT?

11:08.067 --> 11:09.200
HE LIKES IT
WHEN I GIVE HIM THAT.

11:09.200 --> 11:10.600
- ABOUT THE RACES--

11:10.600 --> 11:12.500
YOU DON'T MAKE
THE CHILDREN RACE, DO YOU?

11:12.500 --> 11:13.333
- OH, NO, NO.

11:13.333 --> 11:14.700
- NO, NO.
ADULTS ONLY.

11:14.700 --> 11:18.067
YEAH, YOU GOT TO BE
AT LEAST THIS TALL.

11:18.067 --> 11:20.100
- SO THAT'S HOW YOU BOTH FELL?

11:20.100 --> 11:22.067
A RACE AROUND THE HOUSE,

11:22.067 --> 11:26.200
WHICH YOU OFTEN DO
AS A TRADITION?

11:26.200 --> 11:28.133
- UH, YEAH.

11:28.133 --> 11:30.167
- STUPID, HUMPED-UP
TERMITE TRAP!

11:30.167 --> 11:33.300
[clattering]

11:43.600 --> 11:44.800
- OH, MY GOD!

11:44.800 --> 11:46.900
FRANK, ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?

11:46.900 --> 11:50.167
- HOLY CRAP!

11:50.167 --> 11:51.233
- DON'T MOVE.

11:51.233 --> 11:53.067
I'M COMING RIGHT DOWN!

11:53.067 --> 11:55.667
- I'M IN ENOUGH PAIN!

12:03.467 --> 12:04.733
- THERE YOU GO.

12:04.733 --> 12:06.533
- I MUST SAY,
YOU'RE DOING SURPRISINGLY WELL

12:06.533 --> 12:08.100
AFTER TAKING SUCH A FALL,
MR. BARONE.

12:08.100 --> 12:09.933
NO INJURIES
OTHER THAN A BROKEN RIB.

12:09.933 --> 12:11.600
- OH, THANK GOD!

12:11.600 --> 12:13.800
- YOU HEARD WHAT HE SAID.
I'M FINE.

12:13.800 --> 12:16.233
NO KISSING.

12:16.233 --> 12:18.300
- I TOLD HIM
NOT TO FIX THE STAIRS.

12:18.300 --> 12:20.333
I KNEW SOMETHING
LIKE THIS WOULD HAPPEN.

12:20.333 --> 12:22.600
I CAN'T BEAR
TO SEE HIM HURT.

12:22.600 --> 12:26.367
WHY ARE YOU
SUCH A STUBBORN IDIOT?

12:26.367 --> 12:30.633
- DOCTOR,
CAN I HAVE THIS REMOVED?

12:30.633 --> 12:31.967
- DOCTOR, BEFORE YOU GO,

12:31.967 --> 12:36.400
IS THERE SUCH A THING
AS A PERSONALITY TRANSPLANT?

12:37.600 --> 12:41.467
- OKAY, CRAZIES,
WE'RE IN PUBLIC HERE.

12:41.467 --> 12:43.700
- HEY, DOC, WHAT'S THIS STUFF
DRIPPIN' INTO ME?

12:43.700 --> 12:45.167
- OH,
THAT'S JUST SOME PAINKILLER

12:45.167 --> 12:46.533
TO HELP WITH ANY DISCOMFORT.

12:46.533 --> 12:49.600
- BUT I'M NOT EXPERIENCING
ANY DISCOMFORT.

12:49.600 --> 12:51.933
- THAT'S BECAUSE
IT'S PROBABLY STARTING TO WORK.

12:51.933 --> 12:55.167
- OH.

12:55.167 --> 13:00.133
WAY TO GO,
TUBE AND BAGGIE.

13:00.133 --> 13:01.433
- YES.

13:01.433 --> 13:03.133
NOW, A NURSE WILL BE IN
AT THE END OF THE DAY

13:03.133 --> 13:04.767
TO GIVE YOU
YOUR DISCHARGE PAPERS.

13:04.767 --> 13:08.067
- PAPERS? DON'T YOU GUYS
HAVE BEDPANS ANYMORE?

13:08.067 --> 13:10.367
[laughs]

13:13.133 --> 13:15.167
- YOU SEE
WHAT YOU DID TO HIM, HUH?

13:15.167 --> 13:16.600
ALL OF THIS
BECAUSE YOU AND DEBRA

13:16.600 --> 13:17.667
"FELL DOWN THE STAIRS."

13:17.667 --> 13:19.300
- ALL RIGHT, ROBERT.
- DON'T, ROBERT.

13:19.300 --> 13:20.767
- DOCTOR,
WHILE YOU'RE STILL HERE,

13:20.767 --> 13:23.467
WOULD YOU JUST TAKE A LOOK
AT MY SON'S WRIST?

13:23.467 --> 13:26.300
- YEAH, AND, RAY,
WHEN WAS THE LAST TIME

13:26.300 --> 13:28.700
SOMEONE LOOKED
AT THAT TESTICLE?

13:28.700 --> 13:30.900
- DAD!

13:30.900 --> 13:32.300
- WHAT?

13:32.300 --> 13:35.500
NO ONE'S CHECKED IT
SINCE HE WAS A KID.

13:35.500 --> 13:37.100
- IT'S ALL RIGHT, DAD.

13:37.100 --> 13:41.967
- HEY, HEY, HEY,
NOTHIN' TO BE ASHAMED OF.

13:41.967 --> 13:45.400
- OKAY, DAD.

13:45.400 --> 13:48.933
- AND, DEBRA, YOU SHOULD
SHOW THE DOCTOR YOUR SHOULDER.

13:48.933 --> 13:50.933
- NO, I'M FINE, FRANK,
REALLY.

13:50.933 --> 13:52.933
THANK YOU, THOUGH.

13:52.933 --> 13:55.067
- THEY TOOK A TUMBLE
DOWN THE STAIRS.

13:55.067 --> 13:56.233
- BOTH OF YOU?

13:56.233 --> 13:58.200
- UNUSUAL, ISN'T IT?

13:58.200 --> 14:02.733
- WE HAVE
THESE LITTLE RACES.

14:02.733 --> 14:04.233
- YEAH, YOU KNOW, RAY,

14:04.233 --> 14:06.300
MAYBE YOU SHOULD LET
THE DOCTOR CHECK OUT YOUR WRIST.

14:06.300 --> 14:07.833
I'M SURE YOU AND DEBRA
WANT TO GET BACK

14:07.833 --> 14:10.800
TO YOUR ACTIVE LIFESTYLE
AS SOON AS POSSIBLE, HMM?

14:10.800 --> 14:12.933
- IT'S OKAY. IT'S FINE.
SEE? IT'S ALL BETTER.

14:12.933 --> 14:14.500
- REALLY?
LET'S ARM WRESTLE.

14:14.500 --> 14:15.800
- GET AWAY.
- GIVE IT TO ME!

14:15.800 --> 14:17.667
- GET OUT OF HERE.

14:17.667 --> 14:19.267
- BUT, DOCTOR, REALLY,

14:19.267 --> 14:21.433
YOU SHOULD TAKE A LOOK
IN HIS SHORTS.

14:21.433 --> 14:24.367
- NO!

14:24.367 --> 14:27.800
- THERE'S A PROBLEM
WITH ONE OF THE MAN BERRIES.

14:27.800 --> 14:30.833
- DAD!

14:30.833 --> 14:34.067
YEAH, IT'S--NEVER MIND.

14:34.067 --> 14:36.067
- OKAY, THEN, IF YOU DON'T
NEED ME, MR. BARONE,

14:36.067 --> 14:37.833
YOU TRY
AND TAKE IT EASY.

14:37.833 --> 14:41.800
- OKAY, AND, HEY,
YOU TAKE IT EASY, TOO.

14:41.800 --> 14:43.133
HEY!

14:43.133 --> 14:46.067
PEACE.

14:48.400 --> 14:51.200
- I'M SO SORRY
THIS HAPPENED, FRANK.

14:51.200 --> 14:55.167
- HEY, I WAS HAPPY
TO FIX YOUR STAIRS, DEBRA,

14:55.167 --> 14:57.967
BECAUSE YOU
NEEDED IT DONE.

14:57.967 --> 15:00.667
AND IF I HAD TO BREAK
100 RIBS,

15:00.667 --> 15:06.067
IT'S A SMALL PRICE TO PAY
FOR THE FAMILY STAIRS.

15:06.067 --> 15:08.067
YES.

15:10.233 --> 15:14.633
I TAKE CARE OF MY FAMILY.

15:14.633 --> 15:16.067
"FAMILY."

15:16.067 --> 15:19.700
THAT'S A FUNNY WORD.

15:19.700 --> 15:21.900
FAMILY.

15:21.900 --> 15:25.300
FAMILY, FAMILY, FAMILY.

15:25.300 --> 15:27.133
- I GOT TO GO PICK UP THE KIDS.

15:27.133 --> 15:28.733
YOU WANT TO WALK ME OUT?

15:28.733 --> 15:30.367
- YEAH, I'LL GO WITH YOU.
- OKAY.

15:30.367 --> 15:34.867
- HEY, IF YOU GUYS ARE RACING,
I GET WINNERS.

15:34.867 --> 15:37.433
- WE CAN NEVER
HAVE SEX AGAIN.

15:37.433 --> 15:38.633
- WHAT?

15:38.633 --> 15:41.133
- LOOK AT YOUR FATHER,
LYING IN THERE HURT,

15:41.133 --> 15:43.200
AND ALL BECAUSE WE--

15:43.200 --> 15:44.733
AND NOW WHENEVER--

15:44.733 --> 15:47.900
I'M GONNA THINK OF HIM,
WORKIN' ON THOSE STAIRS,

15:47.900 --> 15:49.933
AND THEN ALL OF A SUDDEN,
HIS LITTLE BALD HEAD

15:49.933 --> 15:53.800
DROPPING OUT OF SIGHT.

15:53.800 --> 15:56.467
- WELL, HERE'S SOMETHING
YOU MIGHT TRY:

15:56.467 --> 15:59.267
THINKING OF ME
WHEN WE'RE HAVING SEX.

15:59.267 --> 16:00.767
- THIS IS AWFUL, RAY.

16:00.767 --> 16:02.900
WE LIED TO HIM,
AND NOW HE HAS A BROKEN RIB.

16:02.900 --> 16:04.433
WE BROKE HIS RIB.

16:04.433 --> 16:07.467
WE MAY AS WELL HAVE ROLLED
OFF THAT BED AND ONTO HIM.

16:07.467 --> 16:10.233
- HEY, ARE YOU TRYING
TO PUT IMAGES IN MY HEAD?

16:10.233 --> 16:12.533
'CAUSE WE MAY
NEVER HAVE SEX AGAIN!

16:12.533 --> 16:13.600
HELLO. HI.

16:13.600 --> 16:16.200
YEAH, LOOK,
THIS IS NOT OUR FAULT.

16:16.200 --> 16:17.700
- YES, IT IS!

16:17.700 --> 16:20.500
THIS IS 30% MY FAULT
AND 70% YOURS.

16:20.500 --> 16:23.067
- WHERE DO YOU COME UP
WITH THOSE FIGURES?

16:23.067 --> 16:24.267
- YOU STARTED THE WHOLE THING.

16:24.267 --> 16:25.633
NONE OF THIS
WOULD HAVE HAPPENED

16:25.633 --> 16:27.367
IF YOU DIDN'T HAVE
TO TELL ALL YOUR FRIENDS

16:27.367 --> 16:28.767
WHAT A BIG STUD YOU ARE!

16:28.767 --> 16:31.067
- OH, WHY COULDN'T
THE NURSE HEAR THAT?

16:31.067 --> 16:33.867
LOOK, THE TRUTH IS,
NONE OF THIS WOULD'VE HAPPENED

16:33.867 --> 16:37.167
IF YOU DIDN'T HAVE THAT
SECOND GLASS OF WINE THAT NIGHT.

16:37.167 --> 16:39.367
OR IF YOU LET ME BUY
A KING-SIZE BED.

16:39.367 --> 16:41.833
OR IF JUST ONCE,
GOD FORBID,

16:41.833 --> 16:45.600
YOU LISTEN TO ME,
AND WE COULD START ON THE FLOOR!

16:48.367 --> 16:50.267
- WE HAVE TO DO SOMETHING
FOR HIM.

16:50.267 --> 16:51.467
- ALL RIGHT, FINE.

16:51.467 --> 16:52.733
- HOW DO WE MAKE THIS UP TO HIM?

16:52.733 --> 16:54.333
WE HAVE TO GET HIM
A SATELLITE DISH.

16:54.333 --> 16:56.733
- WHAT? NO!
LOOK, I'LL GO TO THE CAFETERIA.

16:56.733 --> 17:00.067
I'LL GET HIM
A NICE JELL-O PARFAIT.

17:00.067 --> 17:01.667
- WE HAVE TO MAKE THIS RIGHT.

17:01.667 --> 17:04.067
I CANNOT GO TO BED EVERY NIGHT
WITH THOSE IMAGES IN MY HEAD.

17:04.067 --> 17:05.167
- ALL RIGHT.

17:05.167 --> 17:06.733
ALL RIGHT, I'LL TAKE CARE OF IT.

17:06.733 --> 17:09.533
LAST THING YOU NEED
IS ANOTHER EXCUSE.

17:12.200 --> 17:13.567
- OH, RAYMOND,
I'M SO GLAD YOU'RE BACK.

17:13.567 --> 17:15.100
I WANT TO TAKE ROBBIE
AND INTRODUCE HIM

17:15.100 --> 17:16.100
TO A NURSE I JUST MET.

17:16.100 --> 17:17.633
COME ON, ROBBIE.

17:17.633 --> 17:20.133
- I DON'T THINK I SHOULD
MEET ANYBODY NEW RIGHT NOW.

17:20.133 --> 17:21.600
I DIDN'T WASH
MY HAIR TODAY.

17:21.600 --> 17:23.633
- WELL,
SHE WORKS IN THE HOSPITAL.

17:23.633 --> 17:27.533
I'M SURE SHE'S USED
TO SEEING ALL KINDS OF THINGS.

17:27.533 --> 17:31.333
- COME BACK SOON,
SMUSHY FACE.

17:31.333 --> 17:34.400
- SO HOW'S IT GOING,
OKAY?

17:34.400 --> 17:36.367
- SURE, I'M FINE.

17:36.367 --> 17:38.433
- GOOD.
YEAH, YOU LOOK GOOD.

17:38.433 --> 17:39.267
LISTEN--

17:39.267 --> 17:40.600
- I WAS THINKIN',

17:40.600 --> 17:43.633
IT SHOULD BE PRETTY EASY
TO FINISH THOSE STAIRS.

17:43.633 --> 17:47.133
THE HARD PART'S
ALREADY DONE...

17:47.133 --> 17:50.100
WHERE I FALL THROUGH THEM.

17:50.100 --> 17:52.533
- YEAH, WELL, YOU KNOW,
IT'S ALL RIGHT.

17:52.533 --> 17:54.533
I CAN HIRE SOMEBODY
TO DO IT NOW.

17:54.533 --> 17:55.667
- NO, NO, NO.

17:55.667 --> 17:57.067
NO WAY.

17:57.067 --> 17:59.067
I WANT TO FIX YOUR STAIRS.

17:59.067 --> 18:03.667
ME, NOT SOME GUY.

18:03.667 --> 18:04.933
- THAT'S NICE.

18:04.933 --> 18:08.133
BUT LISTEN, I FEEL BAD
YOU GOT HURT, SO I WANT--

18:08.133 --> 18:10.067
- HEY, DON'T FEEL BAD.

18:10.067 --> 18:13.067
THIS IS WHAT IT'S ALL ABOUT.

18:13.067 --> 18:14.067
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

18:14.067 --> 18:16.467
- I'M NOT AN IDIOT.

18:16.467 --> 18:19.233
REMEMBER WHEN YOU WERE A KID,
YOU GAVE ME THAT MUG THAT SAID

18:19.233 --> 18:21.933
"WORLD'S GREATEST DAD"?

18:21.933 --> 18:24.233
I HATED THAT.

18:28.500 --> 18:33.567
BECAUSE I KNEW
I WAS NOT THAT MUG.

18:33.567 --> 18:37.067
AND NOW YOU GOT
KIDS OF YOUR OWN.

18:37.067 --> 18:40.333
THE WAY YOU ARE WITH THEM...

18:48.267 --> 18:50.633
- WHAT? WHAT, DAD?

18:50.633 --> 18:56.633
- I LIKED IT WHEN YOU MOVED IN
ACROSS THE STREET,

18:56.633 --> 18:58.367
'CAUSE I COULD
COME TO YOUR HOUSE,

18:58.367 --> 19:00.867
YOU COULD COME TO MY HOUSE.

19:00.867 --> 19:03.433
NOTHIN' MUCH, JUST...

19:03.433 --> 19:07.433
DOIN' STUFF, WATCHIN' THE GAME,

19:07.433 --> 19:10.600
PLAYIN' SOME POOL.

19:10.600 --> 19:16.367
BY THE WAY, ONE OF US
SHOULD GET A POOL TABLE.

19:16.367 --> 19:18.967
IT'S GOOD WHAT WE GOT,

19:18.967 --> 19:22.467
'CAUSE WE'RE PALS NOW.

19:25.267 --> 19:29.900
- DEBRA AND I
DIDN'T FALL DOWN THE STAIRS.

19:29.900 --> 19:31.333
- WHAT?

19:31.333 --> 19:36.733
- WE ACTUALLY HURT OURSELVES
IN THE, YOU KNOW,

19:36.733 --> 19:38.167
BEDROOM.

19:38.167 --> 19:41.400
- A BEDROOM RACE?

19:41.400 --> 19:43.933
- NO.

19:43.933 --> 19:46.800
NO, NO, THERE ARE NO RACES,
DAD.

19:46.800 --> 19:50.267
- BUT THEY'RE A TRADITION.

19:50.267 --> 19:53.867
- WE--WE FELL OFF THE BED...

19:53.867 --> 19:55.600
BOTH OF US.

19:55.600 --> 19:58.167
HMM?

19:58.167 --> 20:01.733
DAD, WE FELL OFF THE BED
WHEN WE WERE HAVING SEX.

20:01.733 --> 20:03.367
THAT'S HOW WE GOT HURT.

20:03.367 --> 20:08.167
- THEN THIS IS ABOUT
YOUR TESTICLE.

20:08.167 --> 20:10.367
- WHA--NO.

20:10.367 --> 20:12.500
DAD, NO, IT'S NOT.

20:12.500 --> 20:14.600
I-I LIED TO YOU.
I LIED TO YOU.

20:14.600 --> 20:16.500
I TOLD YOU THE STAIRS
WERE BAD

20:16.500 --> 20:18.767
SO YOU WOULDN'T KNOW
WHAT DEBRA AND I WERE DOING,

20:18.767 --> 20:21.267
AND YOU WOULDN'T HAVE BROKE
YOUR RIB IF IT WASN'T FOR ME,

20:21.267 --> 20:24.467
AND I'M BUYING YOU
A SATELLITE DISH, ALL RIGHT?

20:24.467 --> 20:30.100
- OH,
NOW, THAT'S A GOOD STORY.

20:30.100 --> 20:34.200
WHY DIDN'T YOU
JUST TELL ME THAT STORY?

20:34.200 --> 20:36.533
- BECAUSE IT'S
LIKE A SEX STORY,

20:36.533 --> 20:39.400
AND I DON'T FEEL COMFORTABLE,
YOU KNOW,

20:39.400 --> 20:42.100
TELLING YOU
THAT KIND OF STUFF.

20:42.100 --> 20:44.900
- BUT WE'RE PALS.

20:44.900 --> 20:50.533
- OKAY, WE'RE PALS.

20:52.467 --> 20:55.833
- HEY, YOU WANT
TO KNOW SOMETHIN', PAL?

20:55.833 --> 20:57.967
COULD I TELL YOU A STORY?

20:57.967 --> 20:59.733
- YEAH, YEAH, SURE.

20:59.733 --> 21:03.167
- ONE NIGHT YOUR MOTHER
HAD A LITTLE TOO MUCH KAHLUA--

21:03.167 --> 21:04.533
- NO, NO, NO, DAD!

21:04.533 --> 21:05.367
NO.

21:05.367 --> 21:07.133
- BUT IT'S STORY TIME.

21:07.133 --> 21:08.800
- NO, LOOK,
YOU NEED YOUR REST.

21:08.800 --> 21:10.067
- WAIT, YOU'LL LOVE THIS.

21:10.067 --> 21:11.867
- NO, NO, NO, SWEET DREAMS,
PAL.

21:11.867 --> 21:14.433
- IT WAS COLD OUTSIDE...

21:18.167 --> 21:20.867
- ALL RIGHT, HERE YOU GO.

21:20.867 --> 21:23.700
- SO HOW'S THAT RIB DOIN',
FRANK?

21:23.700 --> 21:24.967
- OH, IT'S COMING ALONG,

21:24.967 --> 21:29.367
ALTHOUGH I STILL CAN'T
BURP THE WAY I LIKE.

21:29.367 --> 21:32.600
- WELL, YOU STICK TO YOUR REHAB.

21:32.600 --> 21:34.933
- I'M HAPPY
TO BE OUT OF THAT HOSPITAL.

21:34.933 --> 21:36.767
BOY, THEY HAD ME SO DRUGGED UP,

21:36.767 --> 21:40.167
I DIDN'T KNOW
WHETHER I WAS COMIN' OR GOIN'.

21:40.167 --> 21:44.733
- I THOUGHT WHAT
THEY HAD YOU ON WAS MARVELOUS.

21:44.733 --> 21:48.133
I'M GONNA CALL MEXICO AND TRY
TO GET SOME FOR THE HOUSE.
