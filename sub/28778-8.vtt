WEBVTT

00:01.438 --> 00:03.089
My name is Danny McNamara.

00:03.095 --> 00:05.213
When I left the FBI,
I thought my crime-fighting

00:05.219 --> 00:07.179
days were over, but then
I learned that terrorist.

00:07.203 --> 00:09.312
Karim Farouk was on
the hunt for Cleopatra,

00:09.318 --> 00:11.384
one of the world's
most valuable treasures,

00:11.390 --> 00:13.158
lost for over 2,000 years,

00:13.163 --> 00:15.232
to use her as part of a
massive terror attack.

00:15.237 --> 00:17.117
To find him, I needed some help,

00:17.123 --> 00:19.621
so I went to Lexi Vaziri, a thief.

00:19.627 --> 00:22.130
Excuse me, a master thief.

00:22.136 --> 00:24.168
And my father was killed by Farouk.

00:24.174 --> 00:26.740
Lexi and I have a complicated past.

00:26.746 --> 00:30.512
He wants to bring Farouk
to justice, I want revenge.

00:30.518 --> 00:32.368
Also, there's a mysterious group

00:32.374 --> 00:34.350
who want Cleopatra as much as we do.

00:34.356 --> 00:36.379
We're not sure whether
they're good or bad,

00:36.385 --> 00:38.231
but the one thing we all agree on...

00:38.237 --> 00:40.361
Is that we need to find Cleopatra...

00:41.800 --> 00:44.799
Before Farouk does.

00:44.818 --> 00:47.518
- She's here.
- Previously on Blood & Treasure...

00:47.585 --> 00:48.809
Cleopatra?

00:49.951 --> 00:51.084
Damn it.

00:51.152 --> 00:52.651
It's just the outer sarcophagus.

00:52.657 --> 00:54.212
So they let the Nazis leave with her

00:54.218 --> 00:56.284
and kept the gold casing for themselves.

00:56.290 --> 00:57.618
She's still out there somewhere.

00:57.684 --> 00:59.917
That's Omar. Farouk's right-hand man.

01:01.890 --> 01:03.023
You're under arrest.

01:09.719 --> 01:11.818
Why do you have a burner phone?

01:11.824 --> 01:13.587
Are you going through my stuff?

01:13.593 --> 01:15.122
You've been spying on me.

01:15.128 --> 01:16.480
No. It's not like that.

01:16.485 --> 01:18.385
I don't trust you to
be a part of the sting.

01:19.341 --> 01:20.817
Can you trace this for me?

01:20.886 --> 01:23.518
I think it's one of Lexi's
underworld contacts.

01:23.524 --> 01:25.423
It's connected to the Farouk case.

01:25.429 --> 01:26.551
Whoa, whoa.

01:26.557 --> 01:28.155
But the FBI wants to talk to you.

01:28.285 --> 01:30.217
I have orders to take you back to Rome.

01:30.286 --> 01:31.885
They didn't tell me anything else.

01:31.891 --> 01:33.939
- Where'd you find her?
- I didn't.

01:33.945 --> 01:35.478
She turned herself in.

01:42.596 --> 01:45.554
Danny, I'm sorry, but the
FBI is extraditing you

01:45.560 --> 01:47.117
back to the United States.

01:47.123 --> 01:48.367
My hands are tied.

01:48.373 --> 01:51.230
I still have no idea what this is about.

01:51.246 --> 01:53.917
It's not about Farouk.
I can tell you that much.

01:53.984 --> 01:56.042
Well, you'll figure it out soon enough.

01:56.255 --> 01:58.462
Special Agent Harper,
Boston field office.

01:58.468 --> 01:59.699
We spoke on the phone.

01:59.705 --> 02:01.325
- Yeah.
- What do you want, Harper?

02:01.331 --> 02:02.498
What I've always wanted.

02:02.566 --> 02:05.905
And now you've given me
the leverage to get it.

02:06.096 --> 02:08.500
- Are the handcuffs really necessary?
- Of course.

02:08.506 --> 02:10.275
You're a criminal now, Danny.

02:10.281 --> 02:13.185
Destruction of property,
criminal conspiracy.

02:13.253 --> 02:16.124
I admit I was surprised that
a straight arrow like you

02:16.192 --> 02:18.327
would get yourself into
this kind of trouble until I

02:18.333 --> 02:20.330
heard you were shacked up with her.

02:20.336 --> 02:22.630
If this is an intervention,
I won't fight you.

02:22.636 --> 02:25.006
I was warned she was the
devil, but I didn't listen.

02:25.074 --> 02:26.843
The devil can hear you, you know.

02:26.911 --> 02:28.313
If you could just trust me...

02:28.319 --> 02:29.653
Who were you communicating with

02:29.659 --> 02:31.202
in Casablanca on the burner phone?

02:31.208 --> 02:32.376
I can't tell you.

02:32.382 --> 02:33.650
Then I guess I can't trust you.

02:33.656 --> 02:35.336
You two left quite a trail

02:35.342 --> 02:37.329
of death and destruction across Europe.

02:37.396 --> 02:40.067
Rome, Germany, Spain, Morocco...

02:40.135 --> 02:42.004
You're a modern-day Bonnie and Clyde.

02:42.010 --> 02:44.257
Did Bonnie know Morocco isn't in Europe?

02:44.263 --> 02:45.384
'Cause I do.

02:45.390 --> 02:48.144
You know we didn't murder anyone.
Ask Agent Karlsson.

02:48.150 --> 02:50.312
You mean the
Interpol agent that filed

02:50.318 --> 02:52.277
the Red Notice that got our attention?

02:53.257 --> 02:55.124
I've got some paperwork to do.

02:57.873 --> 02:59.836
Karim Farouk.

02:59.905 --> 03:01.606
The one that got away.

03:01.736 --> 03:03.271
Eats away at you, doesn't it?

03:03.277 --> 03:06.081
He's a terrorist planning
a major attack, so, yeah,

03:06.273 --> 03:07.841
he's on the top of my to-do list.

03:07.848 --> 03:09.764
We're the ones who
caught his lieutenant in

03:09.770 --> 03:11.723
Casablanca, while you
haven't done anything.

03:11.729 --> 03:14.330
I know about having a
white whale you can't catch.

03:14.398 --> 03:16.021
I myself have a file that

03:16.027 --> 03:17.771
I would do anything to close.

03:19.299 --> 03:21.973
Fensgate Museum heist in Boston.

03:22.545 --> 03:24.849
That was, like, the '90s, right?

03:24.917 --> 03:27.333
They stole, like, a hundred paintings.

03:27.339 --> 03:29.357
Ten paintings.

03:29.363 --> 03:31.403
Those thieves are legends.

03:31.409 --> 03:33.793
Headed off into the sunset, and the Feds

03:33.799 --> 03:35.339
never caught any of them.

03:35.345 --> 03:36.785
It's become quite the convict

03:36.791 --> 03:38.679
bedtime story, but you got it wrong.

03:38.741 --> 03:39.977
We caught one.

03:40.043 --> 03:42.548
Never could get him to talk... his crew,

03:42.616 --> 03:44.285
where the paintings ended up...

03:44.352 --> 03:45.519
Nothing.

03:45.588 --> 03:47.951
And now that window
for answers is closing.

03:47.957 --> 03:50.293
- Why is that?
- Because he's dying.

03:52.086 --> 03:53.722
My father's dying?

03:54.766 --> 03:57.036
Wait. What?

03:57.042 --> 03:59.445
- Where is he?
- Federal prison in Massachusetts.

03:59.551 --> 04:01.175
Want to say hello?

04:01.751 --> 04:04.157
Your dad did the Fensgate heist?

04:04.163 --> 04:05.403
I don't want to talk about it.

04:05.409 --> 04:07.244
Hey. You were in handcuffs.

04:10.733 --> 04:13.103
Patrick McNamara's
currently serving time

04:13.171 --> 04:16.209
for ten counts of violating
U.S. Code Title 18,

04:16.276 --> 04:19.180
Theft of major artwork.

04:19.187 --> 04:20.856
He was supposed to get five years.

04:20.862 --> 04:22.342
And if he had cooperated, we wouldn't

04:22.366 --> 04:24.088
have thrown the book at him.

04:24.094 --> 04:25.655
So he got a life sentence.

04:25.661 --> 04:27.189
How much time does he have?

04:27.195 --> 04:29.266
That depends. Prison health care is...

04:29.272 --> 04:30.331
Not great.

04:31.854 --> 04:33.769
Look, I've asked you
many times in the past

04:33.775 --> 04:35.397
to help me to get him to talk.

04:35.403 --> 04:38.178
This time I'm offering you a chance

04:38.184 --> 04:39.485
to save his life.

04:39.553 --> 04:41.459
Get him to give up the paintings,

04:41.465 --> 04:43.754
and we'll move him to a real hospital.

04:43.938 --> 04:45.574
And the FBI will

04:45.580 --> 04:47.548
drop the charges we have against you.

04:48.836 --> 04:50.905
As the person looking at
the longer list of charges,

04:50.911 --> 04:53.067
I'd say that sounds like a great deal.

04:53.961 --> 04:55.137
You're not going.

04:55.144 --> 04:56.911
No, you don't get a vote, McNamara.

04:56.917 --> 04:58.709
Because we're looking
for stolen paintings

04:58.714 --> 05:01.170
and she's a thief, she could be useful.

05:01.176 --> 05:02.822
And since both of you are looking at

05:02.828 --> 05:05.199
many years behind bars,
she will be incentivized

05:05.205 --> 05:07.866
to make sure that you get
answers out of your old man.

05:08.842 --> 05:10.225
So she's going.

05:12.000 --> 05:18.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

05:35.344 --> 05:38.281
The FBI has a long memory.

05:38.550 --> 05:40.887
If you screw me... try to run,

05:40.893 --> 05:42.361
anywhere in the world...

05:42.367 --> 05:45.005
We will find you. That's a promise.

05:45.195 --> 05:47.699
I want one more thing out of this deal.

05:47.705 --> 05:49.540
You're in no position to negotiate.

05:49.546 --> 05:52.033
I'm your last chance.

05:52.653 --> 05:55.004
The charges you got on
me aren't gonna hold up,

05:55.010 --> 05:56.436
and we both know it.

05:56.442 --> 05:57.861
What do you want?

05:57.929 --> 05:59.764
Farouk's looking for Cleopatra,

05:59.770 --> 06:01.392
and a group of Nazis had her,

06:01.398 --> 06:03.266
at least as far as Casablanca.

06:03.272 --> 06:05.143
We need to find out where they went.

06:05.149 --> 06:07.512
Sorry, Nazis are a bit before my time.

06:07.580 --> 06:09.884
Yeah, but like you said,
the FBI has a long memory.

06:09.951 --> 06:11.720
You can get the records for me.

06:11.787 --> 06:13.720
I need the entire file

06:13.726 --> 06:15.388
on Operation Paperclip.

06:15.642 --> 06:17.859
You want a 75-year-old file...

06:17.865 --> 06:19.701
With a stupid name.

06:19.769 --> 06:22.406
Paperclip was a top-secret U.S. program

06:22.474 --> 06:24.510
that recruited Nazi
scientists to work for us

06:24.516 --> 06:25.817
after World War II.

06:26.178 --> 06:29.082
So they must have tracked
Nazis escaping after the war.

06:29.388 --> 06:32.060
Maybe even from, say, Casablanca?

06:32.066 --> 06:33.280
Exactly.

06:33.286 --> 06:35.132
Harper, I'll get you the paintings.

06:35.137 --> 06:36.763
You get me the Paperclip file.

06:36.831 --> 06:38.467
And when we stop Farouk,

06:38.534 --> 06:39.902
you'll get the credit.

06:46.478 --> 06:48.079
Omar is Farouk's right-hand man.

06:48.218 --> 06:50.388
Our first chance to crack
his entire organization.

06:50.518 --> 06:52.153
So how do you want to do it?

06:52.159 --> 06:54.196
"Good carabiniere, bad Interpol"?

06:54.202 --> 06:55.570
I never liked that expression.

06:55.576 --> 06:57.234
"Bad cop" is not
something any responsible

06:57.240 --> 06:58.975
law enforcement officer
would ever choose.

06:58.981 --> 07:00.216
It's just acting.

07:00.407 --> 07:02.210
Why do I have to be the bad one?

07:02.277 --> 07:04.647
You have a certain...

07:04.715 --> 07:06.183
Something.

07:06.251 --> 07:08.822
I don't see that at all.

07:08.889 --> 07:10.391
Perfect.

07:11.895 --> 07:13.864
What is this?

07:13.870 --> 07:14.990
It's bitter.

07:14.996 --> 07:17.571
- It's good for, digestion.
- It's disgusting.

07:17.577 --> 07:19.130
Look, we'd like to do anything we can

07:19.136 --> 07:21.176
- for you to feel comfortable.
- I'll tell you what.

07:21.200 --> 07:23.187
How about we skip this good cop part?

07:23.315 --> 07:26.654
'Cause I'm really looking
forward to her bad cop part.

07:27.924 --> 07:31.162
We have you on charges
of terrorism and murder.

07:31.230 --> 07:34.034
Also, because international
law prohibits the destruction

07:34.102 --> 07:37.107
of heritage sites, war crimes.

07:37.173 --> 07:38.776
What you say next determines

07:38.782 --> 07:40.440
the difference between life in prison

07:40.446 --> 07:42.249
and life in a much worse prison.

07:45.779 --> 07:47.086
Look...

07:47.092 --> 07:49.416
We know you are devoted to a cause.

07:49.422 --> 07:51.023
Those are the other guys.

07:51.029 --> 07:52.568
I do what I do for money.

07:52.574 --> 07:54.344
I'm not even religious, bro.

07:54.373 --> 07:55.708
Does Farouk know that?

07:55.714 --> 07:56.982
Of course.

07:57.111 --> 07:59.048
Most of the crew are believers,

07:59.115 --> 08:01.786
but they are kept in
line by people like me...

08:01.792 --> 08:04.295
The pros. Farouk wants more than a bunch

08:04.301 --> 08:06.423
of adrenaline junkies
waving their AKs in the air.

08:06.429 --> 08:07.897
You blew up a pyramid.

08:07.966 --> 08:10.333
For Farouk that was a middle finger

08:10.339 --> 08:12.551
for the East and the West.

08:12.975 --> 08:15.677
But it also covered our
tracks and kept the world

08:15.683 --> 08:17.854
watching the news...

08:17.984 --> 08:20.687
While he was already
selling the stolen goods.

08:20.693 --> 08:22.085
So why hasn't he sold Antony?

08:22.091 --> 08:24.761
And why is he so hell-bent on Cleopatra?

08:24.829 --> 08:26.365
What's his ultimate plan?

08:26.371 --> 08:27.873
I will tell you my plan.

08:28.607 --> 08:30.372
I'll let you know everything...

08:30.790 --> 08:32.303
For a sweet deal.

08:32.308 --> 08:35.080
I want a new identity,
I want a new home,

08:35.148 --> 08:36.883
and I want a new bank account.

08:36.952 --> 08:39.354
Hey.

08:39.423 --> 08:41.424
Could take some time.

08:41.493 --> 08:42.894
You have to be quick.

08:43.780 --> 08:45.134
Now that you have me,

08:45.140 --> 08:47.197
Farouk's going to have
to speed up his plan.

08:47.203 --> 08:49.774
Maybe we should just let you go.

08:49.841 --> 08:52.745
I'm sure Farouk will take
very good care of you,

08:52.813 --> 08:54.748
knowing how loyal you are.

08:56.487 --> 08:58.923
Maybe you should have this after all.

09:00.226 --> 09:02.738
It's good for stomach distress.

09:19.700 --> 09:22.378
- Doctor, if you please?
- It's over here.

09:33.660 --> 09:35.400
This is it.

09:36.128 --> 09:38.581
We were supposed to do this
when no one was here.

09:38.649 --> 09:40.154
I have to move up my timeline.

09:40.222 --> 09:42.431
And I'm not paying you
to have a conscience.

09:42.499 --> 09:44.774
It's just more risk. It should also...

09:45.258 --> 09:46.830
Raise my fee.

09:49.831 --> 09:51.604
Just make my weapon, Doctor.

09:51.610 --> 09:52.815
After that, you...

09:52.821 --> 09:55.158
You won't have to worry
about money ever again.

09:56.560 --> 09:58.885
Destroy the lab.

10:18.634 --> 10:21.276
So that's it? This is all
you guys could come up with?

10:21.282 --> 10:23.322
I'm telling you, Pat, it's
the chance of a lifetime.

10:23.328 --> 10:25.288
Come on, Chappie, this is
going too far this time.

10:25.312 --> 10:26.996
- Too far?
- The job is all lined up.

10:27.002 --> 10:30.289
The guard schedules, the entry
codes... everything's all set.

10:30.451 --> 10:33.343
I'm happy to collect for you
guys a few times a month,

10:33.390 --> 10:35.710
turn my head the other way,
but that was before. All right?

10:35.716 --> 10:37.690
That was when I was
on my own. But now...

10:37.696 --> 10:39.058
Now? What now?

10:39.789 --> 10:41.759
You have a son to provide for.

10:42.946 --> 10:45.279
This could set him up in one night.

10:47.574 --> 10:49.323
That's it, it's over.

10:51.685 --> 10:53.953
Patrick, please, I... I need this.

10:55.252 --> 10:56.500
You need this?

11:03.726 --> 11:05.632
Okay. Fine.

11:05.638 --> 11:07.543
Hurry up and show me
the guard schedules.

11:07.550 --> 11:09.445
Watch commander's been
on me for being late

11:09.451 --> 11:11.382
for roll call the past
two times this month.

11:11.388 --> 11:13.445
Look, after this, you'll never have to

11:13.450 --> 11:15.459
worry about another
time card again, so...

11:16.357 --> 11:18.592
Hey. Get that kid out of here.

11:18.598 --> 11:21.185
Danny, get up to your
room and stay there.

11:22.704 --> 11:24.683
- Now!
- You think he heard?

11:24.689 --> 11:26.118
Don't worry about him.

11:26.124 --> 11:27.422
Okay.

11:27.428 --> 11:30.326
So this entry code here
corresponds to that door.

11:55.779 --> 11:58.112
Just so I've got this straight...

11:58.136 --> 12:00.499
You've given me a hard
time ever since we met

12:00.504 --> 12:03.634
- over my career choice.
- "Thief" is not a career.

12:03.640 --> 12:05.060
You're right.

12:05.129 --> 12:08.041
It's an art that requires cunning,

12:08.170 --> 12:10.266
precision, the ability to read people,

12:10.272 --> 12:12.631
- such as when they're lying.
- I never lied to you.

12:12.637 --> 12:13.871
Not saying anything about your

12:13.877 --> 12:15.312
father being a criminal is lying.

12:15.318 --> 12:17.097
I don't think you, of all people,

12:17.103 --> 12:18.680
want to talk about lies of omission.

12:18.686 --> 12:20.744
McNamara.

12:24.478 --> 12:27.841
I'm sure he's just as
nervous as you are.

12:35.535 --> 12:37.665
Look at you.

12:37.732 --> 12:39.664
Got some meat on your bones?

12:39.730 --> 12:42.227
Being 20 years older helps.

12:42.293 --> 12:45.323
Suppose you heard I'm dying.

12:46.259 --> 12:48.981
Your mother used to always
get on me about the cigarettes.

12:48.987 --> 12:51.784
Turns out the old precinct
was full of asbestos.

12:51.851 --> 12:54.048
Hang on... You were a cop?

12:54.116 --> 12:56.290
Two years shy of my pension.

12:56.297 --> 12:58.560
Opted for early retirement here.

12:58.844 --> 13:01.374
Well, I'm a great admirer of your work.

13:01.441 --> 13:04.129
Let me guess... you spent
time behind bars yourself?

13:04.135 --> 13:05.436
Not for very long.

13:05.871 --> 13:08.766
Boy Wonder, shacks up with a con.

13:08.773 --> 13:11.468
We're just working together.

13:21.321 --> 13:23.186
So what do you want, Danny?

13:23.252 --> 13:25.316
We need to talk about the Fensgate.

13:25.384 --> 13:28.879
So are you, gunning
for a promotion, or what?

13:28.947 --> 13:31.810
I'm trying to get you
into a real hospital.

13:31.877 --> 13:33.208
With real care.

13:33.276 --> 13:34.541
You could get better.

13:34.608 --> 13:35.939
I'm not getting better.

13:38.217 --> 13:39.914
So did Harper put you up to this?

13:41.811 --> 13:43.641
Prick.

13:43.647 --> 13:46.494
- He is a prick.
- Can't you see he's using you?

13:46.500 --> 13:48.797
I'm using him to catch a terrorist.

13:49.959 --> 13:51.656
Help me, Dad.

13:51.724 --> 13:53.688
Just-just this once.

13:54.747 --> 13:57.422
He's trying to save your life.

13:59.416 --> 14:01.680
Looks like we're both a little
late for that, aren't we?

14:07.350 --> 14:08.639
I'm not a rat.

14:10.981 --> 14:12.140
Guard?

14:12.146 --> 14:14.366
- No... Don't do this.
- Get me out of here.

14:14.434 --> 14:16.332
Just let me die in peace.

14:17.338 --> 14:19.368
Go visit your mother.

14:24.424 --> 14:26.388
What's he talking about?

14:26.394 --> 14:28.625
- I thought your mother passed.
- She did.

14:28.631 --> 14:31.244
Someone must have him
too scared to talk.

14:31.950 --> 14:33.714
That was a code.

14:33.781 --> 14:35.345
What does it mean?

14:36.123 --> 14:38.684
It means I'm going home.

14:48.019 --> 14:49.981
Can you do my left?

14:49.987 --> 14:52.983
I find that tracking bracelets
throw off my kicking motion,

14:52.989 --> 14:54.500
should that be an issue.

14:55.291 --> 14:56.954
Feel free to do what you got to

14:56.960 --> 14:58.676
do in Boston to get this done,

14:58.738 --> 15:00.672
but I'm damn sure not
gonna lose track of you.

15:00.678 --> 15:02.613
I told you I'd get you the paintings.

15:02.619 --> 15:05.920
- A deal's a deal.
- Do not mistake my desperation

15:05.926 --> 15:08.328
to close this case as weakness.

15:08.581 --> 15:10.682
You pull any stunt...

15:10.751 --> 15:12.688
You or your lowlife friend try to run...

15:12.694 --> 15:14.486
And I will bury you in a cell.

15:14.854 --> 15:16.788
You have 48 hours.

15:16.857 --> 15:18.790
Then so do you.

15:18.858 --> 15:21.860
Have the Operation Paperclip
file ready when I'm back.

15:34.299 --> 15:36.020
I can't believe this

15:36.026 --> 15:38.006
is where you're from.

15:38.070 --> 15:39.737
I assumed you crashed to Earth

15:39.743 --> 15:41.576
in a cape with a big "S" on it.

15:42.116 --> 15:44.636
Figures the one pop
culture reference you know

15:44.642 --> 15:46.410
is so you can make fun of me.

15:46.477 --> 15:49.013
Yep. I've been saving that one.

15:49.409 --> 15:52.338
So if your dad was arrested
when you were a kid,

15:52.344 --> 15:53.511
who'd you live with?

15:53.517 --> 15:55.086
We're gonna have one rule.

15:55.152 --> 15:57.420
No questions. Okay?

15:57.488 --> 16:00.544
That really makes me want
to ask more questions.

16:01.192 --> 16:03.526
Hey, Mrs. Farley.

16:03.595 --> 16:05.161
How you doing?

16:05.229 --> 16:06.796
Danny McNamara.

16:06.864 --> 16:09.500
You got a lot of nerve
coming around here, kid.

16:10.366 --> 16:13.336
Wow. She is friendly.

16:15.309 --> 16:18.175
So, if "see your mother" was code,

16:18.242 --> 16:20.856
did your father mean for
you to go to a cemetery?

16:22.180 --> 16:24.514
My mom's buried in Texas.

17:03.220 --> 17:05.156
This way.

17:21.515 --> 17:23.486
After my dad was arrested,

17:23.704 --> 17:25.732
our house became a crime scene.

17:25.738 --> 17:27.672
Never got my things.

17:27.678 --> 17:29.369
You don't think that
20 years of vagrants

17:29.375 --> 17:30.942
haven't stolen everything?

17:30.948 --> 17:32.715
Luckily...

17:32.783 --> 17:35.051
I kept the one thing
that mattered to me...

17:35.119 --> 17:37.253
Well-hidden.

17:46.964 --> 17:48.503
She's beautiful.

17:48.761 --> 17:51.067
Yeah, she was a nurse
at a V.A. hospital.

17:51.135 --> 17:53.583
Met my dad when he
got back from Vietnam.

17:53.693 --> 17:55.928
I was real little when they split up.

17:55.934 --> 17:57.907
Went with Mom to Texas

17:57.913 --> 17:59.614
until she got sick.

18:00.377 --> 18:03.813
After she died, I was
sent here to be with him.

18:03.881 --> 18:05.615
We,

18:05.683 --> 18:07.951
didn't exactly get along.

18:08.018 --> 18:10.920
Year and a half, I lived with him.

18:11.802 --> 18:13.618
We never once talked about her.

18:13.624 --> 18:17.093
He just walled himself off.

18:17.161 --> 18:19.984
So he was practically a stranger.

18:21.127 --> 18:23.061
He only let me keep a
couple reminders of her

18:23.067 --> 18:25.134
because I promised to hide them.

18:25.998 --> 18:28.137
When he said to come visit my mother,

18:28.205 --> 18:29.572
I think he meant to come here.

18:31.475 --> 18:34.130
'Cause this is all that
I have left of her.

18:34.711 --> 18:37.013
Anything good in me...

18:37.081 --> 18:39.015
She's where it comes from.

18:43.253 --> 18:45.153
She would have really liked you.

18:45.650 --> 18:47.980
You mean she wouldn't have
thought I was the devil?

18:47.986 --> 18:50.411
No, she liked people who made her laugh.

18:50.827 --> 18:52.591
I mean, she's the reason I've seen.

18:52.597 --> 18:54.601
Airplane! A million times.

18:57.414 --> 18:58.547
I don't get it.

18:58.553 --> 19:01.170
There's nothing here.

19:05.109 --> 19:06.876
Wait...

19:06.944 --> 19:09.045
That writing... That
wasn't there before.

19:09.113 --> 19:11.381
Who's Tim Keeler?

19:11.447 --> 19:13.216
I don't know.

19:17.187 --> 19:19.753
- Hey.
- Afternoon.

19:19.759 --> 19:22.125
Enjoying a stroll through
the abandoned buildings?

19:22.192 --> 19:23.993
I'll take that photo, thank you.

19:42.370 --> 19:44.442
I told them this
tracker threw off my kicks.

19:44.448 --> 19:46.481
Come on, we got to go.

19:46.550 --> 19:48.961
Who the hell are those guys?

19:59.250 --> 20:00.863
He double-crossed us, Paddy.

20:00.870 --> 20:03.190
He blew our only escape
route on purpose!

20:03.196 --> 20:05.109
He took the money, took the paintings!

20:05.115 --> 20:07.167
I told you this was a bad idea, but no,

20:07.173 --> 20:10.000
you said it was a perfect score, right?

20:10.745 --> 20:13.424
That guard at the museum, Paddy...

20:14.390 --> 20:16.322
That guard...

20:16.328 --> 20:17.774
He saw your face.

20:17.780 --> 20:19.442
I know, I know.

20:20.021 --> 20:21.737
He's got a family. Okay?

20:23.296 --> 20:25.641
- What?
- His family or our family.

20:25.647 --> 20:28.237
There's no contest.

20:34.170 --> 20:35.736
We got to kill him.

20:45.145 --> 20:47.411
My dad left that note for me.

20:47.417 --> 20:48.871
We were the only two people who

20:48.877 --> 20:50.278
knew that lunch box existed.

20:50.285 --> 20:52.286
So your dad must think
you know Tim Keeler.

20:52.292 --> 20:53.891
Or that I can find someone who does,

20:53.897 --> 20:56.329
which I think I can.

20:56.335 --> 20:58.712
First I want to find
out who's hunting us.

21:03.825 --> 21:06.090
Danny. You okay?

21:06.096 --> 21:07.942
Well, I'm being blackmailed by the FBI

21:07.948 --> 21:09.180
and I just got beat up

21:09.186 --> 21:11.452
in my childhood home,
but other than that, Gwen,

21:11.458 --> 21:14.009
- I'm doing great.
- Did she even ask about me?

21:14.592 --> 21:16.285
What do you know about ex-black ops

21:16.291 --> 21:17.694
working in the Boston area?

21:18.076 --> 21:19.742
Not much.

21:19.748 --> 21:20.972
But Omar is talking.

21:20.978 --> 21:22.995
We learned something new today.

21:23.059 --> 21:26.324
At least some of Farouk's men
are mercenaries for hire.

21:26.330 --> 21:27.763
You think he'd send a crew all

21:27.769 --> 21:29.229
the way here to come after us?

21:29.293 --> 21:31.658
Would you let a border
stop you from hunting him?

21:31.786 --> 21:34.452
You captured one of his
right-hand men in Casablanca.

21:34.458 --> 21:36.158
He's not gonna let that go.

21:36.225 --> 21:37.791
Be careful, Danny.

21:37.859 --> 21:39.791
Yeah, I will.

21:59.959 --> 22:01.091
Danny.

22:02.647 --> 22:04.359
Well, I guess you never hit on any

22:04.364 --> 22:05.930
of them scratchers, Chappie?

22:10.141 --> 22:12.573
- You shouldn't be in here.
- I need to talk about Dad.

22:12.579 --> 22:13.797
You know he's sick?

22:13.803 --> 22:15.269
Yeah, I saw him.

22:15.275 --> 22:16.774
In prison.

22:17.411 --> 22:18.943
When's the last time you did?

22:20.535 --> 22:22.068
Where'd you find her?

22:22.925 --> 22:25.536
I'm your problem right now, not her.

22:26.797 --> 22:28.236
Look who got tough.

22:28.242 --> 22:30.173
Look who got old.

22:30.242 --> 22:31.607
Who's Tim Keeler?

22:32.483 --> 22:34.608
I don't know any Tim Keeler,

22:35.057 --> 22:36.669
especially not in this place.

22:36.675 --> 22:38.867
Well, maybe some fresh air
will jog your memory.

22:38.873 --> 22:42.239
- Hey. Come on, Danny.
- Hey!

22:42.306 --> 22:44.907
This is family business
and none of yours.

22:44.913 --> 22:46.480
Anybody got a problem?

22:46.486 --> 22:47.938
Hey, big guy,

22:47.944 --> 22:49.674
that wobbly left knee?

22:50.206 --> 22:53.072
It's the first thing I'm going for.

22:54.406 --> 22:56.605
Just let 'em do their business.

22:56.672 --> 22:59.606
Thanks a lot, guys. Take it easy.

22:59.672 --> 23:02.572
Take it easy, old times sake and all.

23:02.578 --> 23:04.110
Tim Keeler.

23:04.239 --> 23:07.105
Detective. Dirty, obviously.

23:07.173 --> 23:09.072
Your dad and I used to...

23:09.078 --> 23:10.478
Do muscle work for him, leaning on

23:10.484 --> 23:12.167
store owners who were late on payments.

23:12.173 --> 23:13.881
Then he came to us with Fensgate.

23:13.887 --> 23:16.391
Said it was the score of a
lifetime, that's what he says.

23:16.397 --> 23:18.197
And then he double-crosses
us and he takes off

23:18.203 --> 23:19.929
with everything, leaves us to twist.

23:19.935 --> 23:22.540
- Where is he?
- Danny,

23:23.340 --> 23:26.526
you think if I knew that
I'd still be in this place?

23:26.974 --> 23:28.906
I heard rumors, all right?

23:28.912 --> 23:31.177
That he set himself up on some island.

23:31.183 --> 23:32.672
Living the dream off our backs

23:32.678 --> 23:34.939
while I'm stuck here with nothing.

23:34.945 --> 23:36.649
Outside of a prison,

23:36.655 --> 23:38.225
you got lucky.

23:40.856 --> 23:43.150
You got a lot of your pop
in you, you know that?

23:44.305 --> 23:45.805
Never saw it before.

23:45.873 --> 23:47.640
You should go see him.

23:49.039 --> 23:51.027
But clean yourself up first.

23:52.141 --> 23:55.139
Don't let him know you
wasted your freedom.

23:59.073 --> 24:00.439
We had a deal.

24:01.020 --> 24:03.939
Give me the file on Operation Paperclip.

24:04.006 --> 24:05.139
We're done.

24:05.564 --> 24:08.113
- I don't see any paintings.
- I gave you Keeler.

24:08.119 --> 24:09.644
He's the one behind the robbery.

24:09.650 --> 24:11.334
FBI can figure where to find him.

24:11.340 --> 24:12.773
We did, he's in Cuba.

24:12.840 --> 24:14.472
All the fun and sun of retirement

24:14.540 --> 24:16.973
with no extradition treaty
with the United States.

24:17.457 --> 24:19.330
The Paperclip file will be there

24:19.336 --> 24:20.801
when you come back.

24:20.807 --> 24:22.339
I'm sorry. Back?

24:22.408 --> 24:23.863
The FBI can't just

24:23.869 --> 24:25.810
illegally go into Cuba

24:25.817 --> 24:27.055
to recover stolen goods.

24:27.061 --> 24:29.623
Now, if you two were to somehow

24:29.629 --> 24:32.334
break the laws that
I've sworn to uphold,

24:32.340 --> 24:33.812
then my hands would be tied

24:33.836 --> 24:36.106
by those same
non-extradition limitations.

24:36.173 --> 24:37.496
Absolutely not.

24:37.918 --> 24:39.234
A deal's a deal.

24:39.550 --> 24:41.022
You and your girlfriend can be

24:41.028 --> 24:42.756
the star-crossed lovers
of the penal system.

24:42.762 --> 24:44.867
- She's not my girlfriend.
- I'm not his girlfriend.

24:44.873 --> 24:48.305
Look, Danny...

24:48.435 --> 24:50.701
Your father's taken
a turn for the worse.

24:50.707 --> 24:53.306
- Is-is he...
- Clock is ticking.

24:53.311 --> 24:55.931
If you want to get your dad
out of there, you need to decide

24:55.937 --> 24:57.849
what you're willing to do about it.

24:58.507 --> 25:01.005
I'll give you a moment to think it over.

25:08.178 --> 25:09.978
I know I have no right
to ask you this, but...

25:10.002 --> 25:11.562
Save it. I'm in.

25:12.130 --> 25:14.273
- Thanks.
- On one condition.

25:14.340 --> 25:16.139
You have to answer all of my questions.

25:16.145 --> 25:18.345
I'll answer one question.

25:18.473 --> 25:20.052
Fair.

25:20.473 --> 25:22.806
What really happened
between you and your dad?

25:22.874 --> 25:24.280
And Chappie?

25:24.287 --> 25:26.606
It can't just be that they're criminals.

25:27.423 --> 25:29.206
I'll tell you on the plane.

25:35.068 --> 25:36.634
Can it be done?

25:36.779 --> 25:38.811
I believe so.

25:38.974 --> 25:42.239
There are far easier
toxins to weaponize.

25:42.307 --> 25:45.140
I could whip up a batch of
ricin by the end of the day.

25:45.207 --> 25:47.329
No, it must be this toxin,

25:47.728 --> 25:49.705
and you must work faster.

25:53.634 --> 25:55.399
We found Omar.

25:55.740 --> 25:57.906
He's in Rome being
interrogated right now

25:57.912 --> 25:59.811
by the Italians and Interpol.

26:02.544 --> 26:04.876
You know we cannot trust him.

26:07.061 --> 26:08.993
No, we cannot.

26:11.620 --> 26:13.227
Deal with him.

26:13.233 --> 26:15.384
And if that Interpol agent
and the carabinieri get...

26:15.390 --> 26:17.917
Then deal with them, too.

26:37.178 --> 26:40.073
Police! Open up!

26:41.298 --> 26:44.600
Patrick McNamara, you're under arrest!

26:51.773 --> 26:52.904
Go!

26:52.971 --> 26:54.601
Hands up!

26:55.230 --> 26:57.124
- You all set?
- Yeah, we got him.

26:57.130 --> 26:58.610
All right, make sure you go upstairs,

26:58.616 --> 27:00.336
make sure no one else
is in here, all right?

27:00.360 --> 27:01.855
Let's move. All right.

27:07.952 --> 27:09.116
Chappie.

27:09.122 --> 27:10.518
Chappie, you turn me in?

27:10.524 --> 27:12.578
No. What the hell's going on?

27:12.645 --> 27:14.243
Danny, was it you?

27:19.075 --> 27:20.307
Your own father.

27:20.436 --> 27:22.166
All right, come on.

27:22.923 --> 27:24.301
Watch your head.

27:49.626 --> 27:51.748
So that was really the last time

27:51.754 --> 27:54.274
you saw your father until yesterday?

27:54.434 --> 27:55.829
Yeah.

27:55.835 --> 27:58.083
I must look like a real traitor.

27:58.091 --> 27:59.546
Traitor?

27:59.622 --> 28:02.417
You were protecting him from himself,

28:02.534 --> 28:04.646
- from becoming a murderer.
- Yeah,

28:04.716 --> 28:06.719
by becoming a rat.

28:07.467 --> 28:09.880
You protected that museum guard.

28:09.886 --> 28:11.457
That's what you do.

28:11.661 --> 28:13.573
I never told anyone that story.

28:13.738 --> 28:15.994
Your deep dark secret

28:16.000 --> 28:17.845
is turning a thief in

28:17.868 --> 28:19.561
and saving lives.

28:20.216 --> 28:22.296
Classic Danny.

28:22.733 --> 28:26.055
I fought the stigma of
my dad being a dirty cop

28:26.061 --> 28:28.073
every day of my FBI career.

28:28.203 --> 28:30.920
Everything I've done since
that day was to prove

28:30.989 --> 28:32.565
I wasn't him,

28:32.633 --> 28:34.303
and now here I am,

28:34.309 --> 28:36.328
about to steal the same paintings

28:36.334 --> 28:38.246
I turned him in for stealing.

28:40.886 --> 28:42.763
That's him.

28:43.027 --> 28:44.366
That's Keeler.

28:44.372 --> 28:46.470
He came to my house once.

28:46.558 --> 28:48.101
I remember him.

28:48.548 --> 28:51.317
- You sure you're up to this?
- Come on.

28:51.489 --> 28:53.038
Danny?

28:57.700 --> 28:59.384
Let's see what he can accomplish

28:59.390 --> 29:01.115
with two men on here in the sixth.

29:01.121 --> 29:03.335
Six innings of play, it's 10-7,

29:03.403 --> 29:05.611
Boston over New York.

29:09.672 --> 29:11.130
¿Hablas inglés?

29:11.196 --> 29:13.234
Damn right habla inglés. Where you from?

29:13.240 --> 29:14.674
Dorchester.

29:15.138 --> 29:17.741
- Um, I don't know that area.
- No?

29:17.810 --> 29:19.279
You're not familiar with Boston?

29:20.462 --> 29:22.151
Look...

29:22.218 --> 29:23.487
I don't want any trouble.

29:23.493 --> 29:26.532
We don't want any trouble, either...

29:26.660 --> 29:28.916
- Mike.
- That's funny.

29:28.938 --> 29:31.432
You look more like a Tim to me.

29:39.983 --> 29:42.353
Who the hell are you? What is this?

29:42.359 --> 29:44.139
20 years ago, you double-crossed

29:44.145 --> 29:45.870
Patrick and Chappie McNamara.

29:45.932 --> 29:48.203
- You remember?
- Yes.

29:48.209 --> 29:49.778
Every second of every day.

29:49.784 --> 29:52.021
Tell me everything.
Who planned the heist?

29:52.027 --> 29:53.521
I'll break it off.

29:53.527 --> 29:57.366
I... I put the whole
thing together myself.

29:57.555 --> 29:59.425
And set them up to take the fall?

29:59.493 --> 30:01.029
That was the plan, yeah.

30:01.095 --> 30:02.353
What happened to the paintings?

30:02.359 --> 30:04.096
I knew the paintings would be hot,

30:04.102 --> 30:07.074
so I stashed them on the
Tall Ships in Boston Harbor.

30:07.080 --> 30:09.048
They sailed to Panama, I followed it,

30:09.056 --> 30:10.641
and walked off with my treasure,

30:10.647 --> 30:12.133
figured I'd be set for life.

30:12.196 --> 30:13.565
Who'd you sell them to?

30:13.632 --> 30:16.469
I... couldn't even sell them
on the black market.

30:16.538 --> 30:17.673
They were too hot.

30:17.679 --> 30:19.673
Couldn't even give 'em away.

30:20.379 --> 30:21.581
Where are they?

30:24.386 --> 30:26.309
I might've popped something there.

30:27.782 --> 30:31.866
Pool cue case under the bar, over there.

30:31.872 --> 30:34.765
- All right!
- All right, just move it.

30:35.002 --> 30:36.677
There you go.

30:49.370 --> 30:52.742
You kept these masterpieces
in a bag on the floor?

30:52.810 --> 30:54.913
You could've destroyed them all.

30:54.980 --> 30:58.153
I should have. They've been
nothing but a curse to me.

30:58.283 --> 31:00.051
You stole ten, there's nine here.

31:00.119 --> 31:01.810
The guy who hooked me up with the job,

31:01.816 --> 31:03.792
he only wanted the one.

31:03.798 --> 31:06.269
The guy? What guy?

31:06.337 --> 31:08.940
- I can't...
- What guy hooked you up?

31:09.008 --> 31:11.668
I won't tell you. I'm no rat.

31:13.546 --> 31:16.617
- God!
- You're no rat?

31:19.655 --> 31:22.493
Hey, get this guy off me!

31:22.499 --> 31:23.636
Danny!

31:24.707 --> 31:26.642
Hey!

31:28.900 --> 31:30.602
You're Pat McNamara's kid.

31:30.608 --> 31:31.694
That's right.

31:31.700 --> 31:33.451
I'm Danny McNamara.

31:33.457 --> 31:34.654
I ratted out my own father,

31:34.660 --> 31:37.163
so imagine what I'm gonna do to you.

31:37.495 --> 31:38.762
I-I'm sorry. I didn't know...

31:38.768 --> 31:41.146
Who were you working for?

31:41.342 --> 31:42.777
It was...

31:43.523 --> 31:45.641
- She's back!
- Give me the paintings,

31:45.648 --> 31:47.952
- Now!
- Come on. Follow me.

31:58.874 --> 31:59.975
Move!

32:06.756 --> 32:08.659
Hola, amigo.

32:09.991 --> 32:11.649
Do you like my paintings?

32:11.655 --> 32:14.031
Yes.

32:14.037 --> 32:16.035
Let me show you.

32:17.978 --> 32:19.547
Hey,

32:19.553 --> 32:20.855
amigo.

32:41.258 --> 32:43.094
Who are you people?

32:43.162 --> 32:46.237
Let's not make this any
messier than it has to be.

32:49.174 --> 32:50.242
Trust me.

32:52.550 --> 32:54.051
I do.

32:55.915 --> 32:57.651
Time to go.

32:57.985 --> 32:59.453
Get it out of the fire.

33:31.758 --> 33:34.829
Stealing and dirty tricks?

33:35.413 --> 33:37.350
I like it.

33:38.772 --> 33:41.009
Let's get back to Boston.

33:42.608 --> 33:44.369
 - All right, I need you

33:44.375 --> 33:45.909
to sign there,

33:46.954 --> 33:49.693
and then there.

33:51.161 --> 33:54.933
And finally, right there.

33:55.088 --> 33:57.458
This is a huge win for our case.

33:57.734 --> 33:59.679
Yes, it is.

33:59.748 --> 34:01.950
You got my relocation?

34:02.019 --> 34:04.623
I always thought Montana
sounded really cool.

34:04.690 --> 34:07.244
I got you everything you deserve.

34:07.929 --> 34:10.513
You keep that. It's your copy.

34:11.763 --> 34:14.167
Wait, my copy?

34:14.172 --> 34:15.911
How are they gonna...

34:37.649 --> 34:39.916
He's been poisoned.

35:01.481 --> 35:03.270
How are they treating you?

35:05.042 --> 35:07.971
Well, the nurses are a lot
cuter than the prison guards.

35:09.112 --> 35:10.840
They got good meds.

35:11.947 --> 35:13.856
The food sucks.

35:15.174 --> 35:17.309
Nobody will bring me a Zagnut bar.

35:17.316 --> 35:19.676
In the joint, I could
eat as many as I wanted.

35:20.169 --> 35:22.104
Sneak me one of them, will you?

35:22.431 --> 35:24.232
They're not good for you, Dad.

35:24.906 --> 35:26.879
Yeah, I know.

35:27.598 --> 35:29.927
You should know, um...

35:31.244 --> 35:33.112
Keeler's dead.

35:34.863 --> 35:36.284
Did you do it?

35:36.290 --> 35:39.193
No. But I was there.

35:39.323 --> 35:41.240
That's good.

35:42.327 --> 35:43.967
You don't want to carry that.

35:47.535 --> 35:50.438
W-Why did you leave me that note?

35:51.346 --> 35:53.282
'Cause I panicked.

35:54.880 --> 35:56.815
I had to tell somebody the truth

35:56.961 --> 35:58.124
about Keeler.

35:59.362 --> 36:01.190
And I realized the only person

36:01.196 --> 36:03.206
I trusted in the whole world...

36:03.945 --> 36:05.610
It was you.

36:08.445 --> 36:10.940
It's ironic, isn't it? You were
the one who turned me in.

36:11.133 --> 36:14.372
- You were gonna kill somebody.
- I know. And I was.

36:15.521 --> 36:18.191
You did the right thing to stop me.

36:23.467 --> 36:25.939
You always were your
mother's boy, Danny.

36:30.810 --> 36:33.017
It's a good thing Farouk's mercenaries

36:33.023 --> 36:35.428
cared more about these
paintings than offing us.

36:35.819 --> 36:37.554
'Cause that was a gamble.

36:37.560 --> 36:39.513
We might have slowed him
down if he was planning

36:39.519 --> 36:42.389
on funding the next phase
of his attack with these.

36:42.395 --> 36:43.991
Operation Paperclip...

36:43.997 --> 36:45.500
Everything you wanted.

36:45.506 --> 36:47.630
But my case isn't closed.

36:47.636 --> 36:50.319
I'm still missing a painting
by Jean-André Rixens.

36:50.325 --> 36:52.710
Something called The Death of Cleopatra.

36:52.716 --> 36:54.512
Mean anything to you?

36:55.343 --> 36:57.111
There are no coincidences.

36:57.117 --> 36:59.088
Keeler was killed before we

36:59.094 --> 37:00.667
could get any more out of him.

37:01.921 --> 37:03.989
Well, then maybe after
you're done with Farouk,

37:03.995 --> 37:06.098
you'll come back, help finish this one.

37:07.434 --> 37:09.603
A deal's a deal.

37:09.609 --> 37:11.921
Good luck catching
the one that got away.

37:16.367 --> 37:17.977
This file is the key to finding

37:17.983 --> 37:20.057
out where the Nazis took Cleopatra.

37:20.120 --> 37:22.289
And there's no way Farouk has it.

37:22.357 --> 37:24.927
So I guess, in the end, crime did pay.

37:25.260 --> 37:27.829
That's really the lesson
you took from this?

37:27.835 --> 37:29.970
I'll admit I was never a good student.

37:31.484 --> 37:33.470
Fabi

37:33.775 --> 37:36.311
was the one on the other
end of that burner phone.

37:37.202 --> 37:39.323
I didn't tell you because he threatened

37:39.329 --> 37:41.123
to kill you if I said anything.

37:41.129 --> 37:42.294
Why?

37:42.821 --> 37:45.457
Because he's in the
Brotherhood of Serapis.

37:47.561 --> 37:49.805
How is it that every answer

37:49.811 --> 37:51.402
always creates ten new questions?

37:51.408 --> 37:53.222
Look, I don't know much more than that,

37:53.228 --> 37:55.655
I was just giving him
enough to keep him close.

37:55.661 --> 37:57.845
But everything I did

37:57.920 --> 38:00.490
I did to protect you.

38:01.049 --> 38:02.535
I've always been on your side,

38:02.541 --> 38:04.125
whether you believe it or not.

38:07.336 --> 38:08.768
Okay.

38:09.529 --> 38:11.165
Okay?

38:11.231 --> 38:14.704
Look, I've had enough
grudges in my life.

38:14.966 --> 38:17.373
You did what you thought was right.

38:18.209 --> 38:20.712
There's something about
the way you said that.

38:21.720 --> 38:24.009
What did you do?

38:24.015 --> 38:25.482
Don't be angry.

38:25.681 --> 38:26.883
I gave that number to Gwen.

38:26.889 --> 38:28.442
Fabi's number, to trace.

38:28.448 --> 38:30.176
I told her whoever it
belonged to was dangerous.

38:30.181 --> 38:31.667
- Danny.
- See, this is why we can't be

38:31.673 --> 38:34.033
- keeping secrets from each other.
- Danny, if she finds out

38:34.040 --> 38:35.487
- he's in the Brotherhood.
- I know.

38:35.493 --> 38:36.642
We lose a key ally.

38:36.648 --> 38:39.216
Plus, he was my source when we
robbed Egyptian Intelligence.

38:39.222 --> 38:41.013
- If he goes down...
- We could be watching.

38:41.019 --> 38:43.142
- Farouk walk away from behind bars.
- Yes.

38:43.334 --> 38:44.468
That.

38:44.474 --> 38:45.674
I'll call Gwen,

38:45.680 --> 38:47.459
I'll move her off it.

38:47.465 --> 38:50.420
You'll move Swedish Terminator off it.

38:50.426 --> 38:52.461
It's gonna be fine.

38:52.529 --> 38:55.799
See, don't you wish
I didn't tell you now?

38:55.868 --> 38:57.435
I'm glad you did.

38:57.503 --> 39:01.142
Now we can get back to
being Team Danny and Lexi.

39:01.209 --> 39:03.377
I believe it's Lexi and Danny.

39:15.965 --> 39:17.132
Pronto.

39:17.200 --> 39:19.336
The lawyer slipped
the surveillance cameras.

39:19.403 --> 39:20.971
She's in the wind.

39:23.848 --> 39:24.933
Hello?

39:24.939 --> 39:26.708
We triangulated and traced the number

39:26.714 --> 39:28.483
Danny McNamara gave you.

39:28.551 --> 39:31.420
It's been on and off all day.
Currently, it's active.

39:31.612 --> 39:32.946
Right, where is it?

39:32.952 --> 39:35.322
It's coming from the carabinieri
headquarters in Rome.

39:35.328 --> 39:37.864
Ground floor, north end of the building.

39:44.209 --> 39:45.776
Yeah.

39:52.521 --> 39:54.189
Is that it?

39:54.257 --> 39:56.259
It's quite powerful.

39:58.544 --> 40:01.448
Just a fraction of the
amount I've produced

40:01.454 --> 40:03.389
is lethal.

40:14.822 --> 40:17.258
I've procured a lab monkey
for a live demonstration.

40:17.326 --> 40:19.361
If you'll have one of
your men bring him in.

40:22.500 --> 40:24.068
What are you doing?

40:24.074 --> 40:26.176
Moving on to human trials.

40:40.929 --> 40:42.864
Congratulations, Doctor.

40:44.134 --> 40:45.468
It works.
