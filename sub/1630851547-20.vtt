WEBVTT

00:46.046 --> 00:47.395
Who are you?

00:53.618 --> 00:55.011
The hell is this about?!

01:01.974 --> 01:03.324
Beth.

01:05.935 --> 01:07.023
Beth!

01:08.590 --> 01:11.158
What the hell
do you want from us?

01:11.201 --> 01:14.422
Good evening...

01:14.465 --> 01:16.424
Detective Katsumoto.

01:18.165 --> 01:19.557
We don't wish to harm you

01:19.601 --> 01:22.299
or your ex-wife.

01:23.474 --> 01:27.130
In fact, we need
you alive...

01:27.174 --> 01:28.305
because

01:28.349 --> 01:30.046
we have a problem...

01:31.482 --> 01:34.181
...and you're the only man
on the island

01:34.224 --> 01:36.879
who can fix it.

01:36.922 --> 01:39.142
And you will fix it.

01:39.186 --> 01:41.579
Because if you don't...

01:43.625 --> 01:47.063
Beth will die.

02:39.289 --> 02:41.248
Juliet,

02:41.291 --> 02:43.685
do you want a romantic
relationship with Magnum?

02:43.728 --> 02:45.077
No, there's so much at stake.

02:45.121 --> 02:47.341
There's a lot to risk,

02:47.384 --> 02:48.777
but it's better
than the alternative.

02:48.820 --> 02:50.082
Which is what?

02:50.126 --> 02:53.347
Saying no to what
you really want.

03:12.104 --> 03:14.455
Thomas.

03:14.498 --> 03:16.021
Higgins. Hey.Hi.

03:16.065 --> 03:17.806
Hey. Um...

03:17.849 --> 03:20.069
Sorry if I'm intruding.
I did knock, though.

03:20.112 --> 03:21.897
Yeah, but you
knocked and entered.

03:21.940 --> 03:24.334
Uh, normally, you knock
and wait for a response.

03:24.378 --> 03:27.424
Well, yes, but some people
use knocking

03:27.468 --> 03:29.513
as, like, a heads-up.
Anyway...

03:29.557 --> 03:30.993
Sorry.

03:31.036 --> 03:33.604
I should have waited
for a response.

03:33.648 --> 03:35.780
It's fine.

03:35.824 --> 03:36.955
Uh, what's up?

03:36.999 --> 03:39.436
Is now a... good time?

03:39.480 --> 03:40.742
A good time for what?

03:40.785 --> 03:43.179
Just... in general.

03:43.223 --> 03:44.180
Are you okay?

03:44.224 --> 03:45.616
Me? I'm fine.

03:45.660 --> 03:46.965
Yeah. Do I not seem fine?

03:47.009 --> 03:49.490
You just don't
seem like yourself.

03:49.533 --> 03:50.447
Well...

03:50.491 --> 03:53.537
the reason
I came over is...

03:53.581 --> 03:55.191
Well, I want
to tell you something.

03:56.584 --> 03:58.455
I just want to make sure
that I-that I get it right.

04:00.109 --> 04:02.242
Okay.Thing is...

04:03.895 --> 04:06.942
I've been doing
a lot of thinking,

04:06.985 --> 04:08.987
and...

04:10.815 --> 04:12.643
Thomas, have you
seen my jacket?

04:12.687 --> 04:13.862
Oh.

04:13.905 --> 04:16.430
Uh, Juliet, hi.

04:16.473 --> 04:17.692
Morning.

04:17.735 --> 04:19.650
Lia. Hi. Morning.
Um, I'm really sorry.

04:19.694 --> 04:21.783
I-I didn't know that
you had company.

04:23.350 --> 04:24.612
W-W... Yeah, I-I...

04:24.655 --> 04:26.266
uh, offered

04:26.309 --> 04:28.485
to buy Thomas
dinner after we...

04:30.008 --> 04:31.445
...finished the
case, and we

04:31.488 --> 04:35.362
ended up here for a drink.
Several drinks, actually.

04:35.405 --> 04:38.669
Not gonna lie, I am feeling
a little hungover.Yeah.

04:38.713 --> 04:40.497
I figured, actually.

04:40.541 --> 04:42.543
Excuse me for a second.

04:45.372 --> 04:47.896
Higgins, do you want
to talk privately?

04:47.939 --> 04:50.028
No, no, no. It's fine.
Don't worry. It's not important.

04:50.072 --> 04:52.074
I... We can talk
about it later.

04:52.117 --> 04:55.556
Bye, Lia. It's good to see you.

04:55.599 --> 04:56.818
Yeah, you too.

05:16.228 --> 05:17.491
I know what it looks like, but

05:17.534 --> 05:19.231
nothing happened.
You know, the only reason why

05:19.275 --> 05:21.146
she spent the night is because
she drank too much,

05:21.190 --> 05:22.713
and she couldn't drive, so...

05:22.757 --> 05:24.498
I actually slept
on the couch,

05:24.541 --> 05:26.369
so, like I said,
nothing happened.

05:26.413 --> 05:28.980
Yeah, but nobody's saying
that anything did.

05:29.024 --> 05:31.156
Yeah, why you getting
so defensive?No, I'm not

05:31.200 --> 05:32.419
getting defensive,
it's just that,

05:32.462 --> 05:34.812
when Higgins saw her, uh,
she had this look.

05:34.856 --> 05:36.553
It was-it was very subtle,

05:36.597 --> 05:37.902
but it was like
she was disappointed.

05:37.946 --> 05:39.121
And I didn't even
do anything wrong.

05:39.164 --> 05:41.079
All right, but you two
broke up a while ago.

05:41.123 --> 05:42.603
Maybe Higgy was just
caught off-guard.

05:42.646 --> 05:44.300
No. I don't think it was that.

05:44.344 --> 05:46.215
You know what, I wouldn't
sweat it. I-I'd be thankful

05:46.258 --> 05:47.782
that you found out
about Higgins and Cole

05:47.825 --> 05:48.783
before you said anything.

05:48.826 --> 05:50.524
Sometimes, I
wish I hadn't

05:50.567 --> 05:54.354
opened my mouth with Suzy. It-it
just makes things get weird.Yeah.

05:54.397 --> 05:56.486
Where's Gordie?
His burrito's getting cold.I don't know.

05:56.530 --> 05:58.793
I texted him a while ago,
and still no response.

05:58.836 --> 06:00.229
Hm.

06:00.272 --> 06:02.362
Maybe he got something
better to do.

06:02.405 --> 06:03.450
All right, you're giving
me some of that.

06:03.493 --> 06:05.103
Get in there.

06:42.750 --> 06:44.665
Sorry, Gordie, there's
a statute of limitations

06:44.708 --> 06:46.710
on burritos, so, unfortunately,
we split yours

06:46.754 --> 06:48.669
three ways.I need to see you right away.

06:48.712 --> 06:49.844
Well, uh...

06:49.887 --> 06:51.106
I'm about ten minutes from HPD.

06:51.149 --> 06:52.934
No, no. No, no.
I'll drop you a pin.

06:52.977 --> 06:54.022
Everything okay?

06:54.065 --> 06:55.937
Just get there
as soon as you can.

06:57.504 --> 06:58.766
Something wrong?

06:58.809 --> 07:00.420
I don't know.

07:09.559 --> 07:12.475
Hey. Guess you got
the same call I did.

07:12.519 --> 07:14.042
Any idea what's
going on?

07:14.085 --> 07:15.609
No.

07:15.652 --> 07:16.871
Gordon did not sound happy.

07:16.914 --> 07:18.220
Maybe you've done
something wrong.

07:18.263 --> 07:20.135
Uh, maybe you did
something wrong.

07:20.178 --> 07:23.225
Well, I guess we'll find out
soon enough.

07:23.268 --> 07:26.446
Hey, um...

07:26.489 --> 07:29.710
about last night, I just
want to say nothing happened.

07:31.538 --> 07:33.670
I'm sorry?Between me and Lia. I-I know

07:33.714 --> 07:35.672
what it looked like,

07:35.716 --> 07:39.110
and, uh, yeah,
nothing happened.

07:42.418 --> 07:44.768
You're an adult. You don't
have to explain yourself to me.

07:44.812 --> 07:46.596
Yeah, I know. It just
seemed like you were

07:46.640 --> 07:48.729
bothered or...

07:48.772 --> 07:49.947
I don't know. Maybe not
bothered, but...

07:49.991 --> 07:51.775
something.

07:51.819 --> 07:54.561
I was just surprised, is all.

07:54.604 --> 07:56.171
Fair enough.

07:57.955 --> 07:59.696
What did you want
to talk about, anyway?

08:01.393 --> 08:03.918
Just, uh, tedious work stuff,

08:03.961 --> 08:06.573
which is why I said
it could wait.

08:14.363 --> 08:15.538
Thanks for coming.

08:15.582 --> 08:16.626
Of course, Gordie.
What's up?

08:18.367 --> 08:20.064
Last night, Beth and I
were both abducted.

08:20.108 --> 08:22.589
What? How did you escape?I didn't.

08:22.632 --> 08:25.896
They let me go.
But they still have Beth.

08:26.941 --> 08:28.203
What do they want?

08:28.246 --> 08:29.596
They want me to go
into Wahiawa Prison today

08:29.639 --> 08:31.119
and meet up with my old partner,
Shane Whelan.

08:32.163 --> 08:33.730
And then they want me
to kill him.

08:42.130 --> 08:43.653
I don't get it, if they
wanted to kill somebody

08:43.697 --> 08:45.437
inside the prison, why wouldn't
they enlist a prisoner?

08:45.481 --> 08:47.222
Well, that's assuming
they could get to him.

08:47.265 --> 08:49.920
Turns out Whelan's
in protective custody.

08:49.964 --> 08:52.575
Only a few guards and prison
staff have access to him.

08:52.619 --> 08:54.925
But, as a cop, you can
request an interview.

08:54.969 --> 08:55.926
Exactly.

08:55.970 --> 08:57.232
The kidnappers instructed me

08:57.275 --> 08:58.842
to put in the request
for this afternoon

08:58.886 --> 09:00.322
and then go into work
and act normal.

09:00.365 --> 09:02.803
They also said
if I try to track them down

09:02.846 --> 09:06.067
or involve HPD, they'll know,
and they'll kill Beth.

09:06.110 --> 09:08.678
Any idea who would
want Whelan dead?

09:08.722 --> 09:10.245
I imagine that's a long list.

09:10.288 --> 09:12.813
Perhaps if we can figure
that out, then we can work out

09:12.856 --> 09:14.466
who's leveraging you.

09:14.510 --> 09:16.512
Yeah, I can pull
his visitor logs,

09:16.556 --> 09:18.035
see who he's been
talking to on the outside.

09:18.079 --> 09:20.342
In the meantime, we'll see
if we can retrace Beth's steps.

09:20.385 --> 09:21.952
See if we can find out
where she was taken.

09:22.866 --> 09:24.215
We're gonna get Beth back.

09:24.259 --> 09:26.435
Okay?

09:28.480 --> 09:31.962
His uncles took him to
a Grizzlies game last night,

09:32.006 --> 09:33.790
and he's got family
coming in from Knoxville

09:33.834 --> 09:34.965
to visit him today.

09:35.009 --> 09:36.880
Sounds like Cade's having
a great time.

09:36.924 --> 09:39.013
Hey, you know
what this means?

09:39.056 --> 09:40.405
You get more time to spend
with Mahina,

09:40.449 --> 09:43.365
right? Yeah.That sounds like a good idea.

09:43.408 --> 09:45.454
Oh, that's me.

09:46.934 --> 09:48.457
Hey.

09:48.500 --> 09:50.938
Hey, where are you right now?

09:50.981 --> 09:52.853
Uh, I'm with TC.
We're playing hooky.

09:52.896 --> 09:55.072
We're at Bowls.
The waves are firing.

09:55.116 --> 09:58.641
Yeah, well, we got some
major waves over here, too.

09:58.685 --> 09:59.816
My water just broke.

10:01.339 --> 10:02.471
What do you mean
your water just broke?

10:02.514 --> 10:03.777
You're not due
for another couple weeks.

10:03.820 --> 10:06.257
Tell that to the baby.
This thing wants out.

10:06.301 --> 10:07.432
Tell that to the baby.
Tell the...

10:07.476 --> 10:08.956
Baby-baby's coming.
Baby's coming. TC,

10:08.999 --> 10:10.653
baby wants out.
It's go time. TC, it's go time.

10:10.697 --> 10:12.350
It's go time.
What do we-what do we do?

10:12.394 --> 10:14.831
what do we do?For starters,
you can get your butt over here.

10:14.875 --> 10:16.572
Okay. All right,
TC's gonna drive.I'll-I'll drive.

10:16.616 --> 10:17.834
We're on our way.We're on our way.

10:17.878 --> 10:19.401
We're on our way.

10:19.444 --> 10:21.446
This was the last
location of Beth's phone

10:21.490 --> 10:22.622
before it was
powered off.

10:22.665 --> 10:24.058
That's about a mile
from her house.

10:24.101 --> 10:25.712
Gordon mentioned that
she sometimes jogs at night.

10:25.755 --> 10:27.365
Maybe she was out for a run.

10:27.409 --> 10:29.237
The kidnappers follow her,
wait for their moment,

10:29.280 --> 10:30.368
and then
grab her here.

10:30.412 --> 10:32.066
Makes sense. Residential area,

10:32.109 --> 10:33.676
no traffic cams, and then this

10:33.720 --> 10:34.895
entire side is a park.

10:34.938 --> 10:36.287
Yeah, it's a total blind spot.

10:36.331 --> 10:37.419
Well, maybe not. What about

10:37.462 --> 10:38.986
this area?

10:39.029 --> 10:40.378
It's a community garden. So?

10:40.422 --> 10:41.641
Well, a lot of them
have security cameras.

10:43.381 --> 10:44.818
What?

10:44.861 --> 10:47.168
Produce theft
is a serious problem.Oh.

10:47.211 --> 10:49.039
Please tell me
you have something.

10:49.083 --> 10:50.084
Maybe. We have

10:50.127 --> 10:51.781
security footage
of Beth's abduction.

10:51.825 --> 10:54.479
She was out for a run when two
men grabbed her and threw her

10:54.523 --> 10:56.003
in the back of a van
and took off.

10:56.046 --> 10:58.179
The time code
reads47 p.m.

10:58.222 --> 10:59.180
You get a plate off the van?

10:59.223 --> 11:00.529
Yes, but unfortunately,

11:00.572 --> 11:02.139
it was reported stolen
this morning.

11:02.183 --> 11:04.533
HPD plate readers spotted it
in Kalihi Kai

11:04.576 --> 11:06.274
at00 p.m. last night,
so we're thinking that's

11:06.317 --> 11:08.015
where they've taken her.

11:08.058 --> 11:09.930
Well, we need to canvas the
area, check vacant buildings,

11:09.973 --> 11:11.453
anywhere they
may be holding her.

11:11.496 --> 11:13.455
Yeah, trouble is,
it's a huge area to cover.

11:13.498 --> 11:16.327
Gordie, when you were on
the livestream with Beth,

11:16.371 --> 11:18.025
what can you tell me
about the room?

11:18.068 --> 11:19.287
Can you remember anything?

11:21.637 --> 11:23.291
Uh, the walls were cinderblock.

11:25.597 --> 11:27.599
There were baker's racks
in the background.Okay,

11:27.643 --> 11:29.210
I'll see what I can find.All right,

11:29.253 --> 11:30.820
I actually have something
as well.

11:30.864 --> 11:32.604
Seems Whelan recently had
a visit from some lawyers

11:32.648 --> 11:33.605
in the Justice Department.

11:33.649 --> 11:35.085
Well, if he was meeting

11:35.129 --> 11:36.783
with the Feds, he
was probably trying

11:36.826 --> 11:38.219
to cut a deal.Mm-hmm.

11:38.262 --> 11:40.134
If he was about to roll
on someone,

11:40.177 --> 11:42.092
that would explain
the urgency to take him out.

11:42.136 --> 11:43.877
Any idea who he
might be giving up?

11:43.920 --> 11:46.314
No, and I'm due at Wahiawa
at00 p.m.,

11:46.357 --> 11:47.794
which doesn't give us
much time to find out.

11:47.837 --> 11:49.709
Well, we may not have to.
I think I've got something.

11:49.752 --> 11:52.059
There's an old baking plant
on Middle Street.

11:52.102 --> 11:53.234
It's currently
not in use.

11:53.277 --> 11:55.192
That could
be where they're holding Beth.

12:15.256 --> 12:16.605
In here!

12:19.739 --> 12:22.567
This is where they had Beth.
They must've moved her.

12:30.053 --> 12:33.100
You broke the rules, Detective.

12:34.884 --> 12:36.756
We warned you...

12:36.799 --> 12:39.019
there would be consequences.

12:39.062 --> 12:41.064
Okay, just wait a minute.

12:42.544 --> 12:44.981
No! You son of a bitch!

12:45.025 --> 12:45.939
I'll kill you!

12:45.982 --> 12:47.767
I swear to God,

12:47.810 --> 12:49.638
I will hunt you down
and kill you!

12:57.733 --> 12:58.865
Don't get...

12:59.996 --> 13:02.172
...angry at us, Detective.

13:02.216 --> 13:05.088
This was on you.

13:05.132 --> 13:07.743
Now, either do what we want,

13:07.787 --> 13:10.572
or the next one
goes in her head.

13:27.502 --> 13:29.504
Deadline is in less
than two hours, Gordon.

13:29.547 --> 13:30.984
We should consider
informing HPD.

13:31.027 --> 13:32.159
No.
Look at what they just did.

13:32.202 --> 13:33.551
I'm not gambling
with Beth's life.

13:44.084 --> 13:47.435
Listen, we can't take away
their leverage, but maybe...

13:47.478 --> 13:50.177
maybe we can get
some of our own.

13:50.220 --> 13:51.831
How?

13:51.874 --> 13:54.050
I have an idea, but...

13:54.094 --> 13:55.791
you're not gonna like it.

14:01.318 --> 14:02.929
You're okay,
you're okay.

14:02.972 --> 14:05.192
It's okay. It's okay.

14:05.235 --> 14:08.195
Oh, hey, if it isn't
the uncle-to-be.

14:08.238 --> 14:10.197
How's it going?

14:10.240 --> 14:12.852
Oh, really, Thomas?
I'm having a baby here,

14:12.895 --> 14:14.157
and you're asking me
for a favor?

14:15.289 --> 14:17.117
You're having a baby?

14:17.160 --> 14:19.162
I'm not having a baby. I'm
sorry. I'm not having a baby.Really? Yeah.

14:19.206 --> 14:21.730
Uh-huh.You're having a baby.
Uh-huh. A uniform?

14:21.773 --> 14:23.906
It's kind of a big ask, pal.

14:23.950 --> 14:27.127
Uh, yeah, no.
I-I can do it, no problem.

14:27.170 --> 14:28.998
Uh, what's this for?
You-you know what? Never mind.

14:29.042 --> 14:31.609
I don't want to know. Okay.
I'm texting him now.

14:31.653 --> 14:32.872
Okay.I changed my mind.

14:32.915 --> 14:34.743
I want the epidural.Okay, we're gonna get you

14:34.786 --> 14:36.136
the epidural. We're gonna
get you the epidural. Okay.Please, please.

14:36.179 --> 14:37.572
I want the epidural, please.

14:37.615 --> 14:39.356
How we doing?I want the epidural. I need

14:39.400 --> 14:41.489
Uh, I think we're
saying yes to drugs.the epidural. Yes to drugs.

14:46.711 --> 14:48.626
Sorry about the arm.

14:50.106 --> 14:52.239
Had to make a point.

14:54.458 --> 14:57.244
Least now, your ex...

14:57.287 --> 14:59.028
knows what
he has to do.

15:04.816 --> 15:06.818
I mean, the man couldn't
save his own sister.

15:09.343 --> 15:11.867
Now, certainly, he's not gonna
let down the mother of his son.

15:14.043 --> 15:17.003
He knows you, doesn't he?

15:17.046 --> 15:19.353
That's why the mask.

15:19.396 --> 15:20.963
That's why you have me
speak for you.

15:21.007 --> 15:22.747
Well...

15:22.791 --> 15:24.967
Generally, in a
kidnapping case,

15:25.011 --> 15:26.926
a mask is pretty standard.

15:26.969 --> 15:29.102
But, yeah,

15:29.145 --> 15:32.018
I know Gordon
and Whelan.

15:32.061 --> 15:35.456
They were a real problem
for me a while back.

15:35.499 --> 15:38.285
I thought I took care of it,
but, you know Whelan--

15:38.328 --> 15:41.157
can't keep his mouth shut.

15:43.290 --> 15:45.509
Looking back,

15:45.553 --> 15:47.729
I should have just
killed them both.

15:52.908 --> 15:54.170
Comms check.

15:54.214 --> 15:56.042
Clear. Heading in now.

15:56.085 --> 15:57.652
You know, I don't think anyone's

15:57.695 --> 15:58.696
ever tried this before.

15:58.740 --> 15:59.959
And with good reason.

16:00.002 --> 16:02.222
Oh, you mean
breaking into a prison?

16:02.265 --> 16:04.050
Probably right.

16:21.676 --> 16:22.807
Open up the gate.

16:28.813 --> 16:29.989
Open.

16:31.077 --> 16:32.643
Okay, you want to take
your first left.

16:32.687 --> 16:34.036
The fastest route to the server

16:34.080 --> 16:36.430
is across the yard.

16:50.966 --> 16:53.055
Okay, you want the entrance
on the northeast side.

16:53.099 --> 16:56.232
Give me more.

16:56.276 --> 16:58.452
You got to keep going, bro.

16:58.495 --> 16:59.931
Two more.

16:59.975 --> 17:01.933
Uh, that might be a problem.

17:01.977 --> 17:03.848
Just stay on the periphery.

17:03.892 --> 17:04.936
You'll be fine.

17:04.980 --> 17:06.764
No, it's not that.

17:06.808 --> 17:09.289
There's an inmate here
in the yard, and, uh, well...

17:10.725 --> 17:12.553
...I'm kind of the reason
why he's here.

17:16.600 --> 17:19.212
Just get to the door as
quickly as you can, all right?

17:31.050 --> 17:32.529
Oh!

17:32.573 --> 17:34.488
Come on, Suzy, keep pushing,
keep pushing.

17:34.531 --> 17:35.837
I'm so proud of you.
You're doing so good.

17:35.880 --> 17:38.057
You're doing so good.I can't do it.

17:38.100 --> 17:39.580
You can do it,
you can do it.

17:39.623 --> 17:42.409
Okay, Suzy, we just need
one last big push.

17:42.452 --> 17:44.150
Come on, come on.Come on, come on.

17:44.193 --> 17:45.368
Push, push, push. That's it.There you go.

17:45.412 --> 17:47.588
That's it. Push.
Come on, you got it.

17:47.631 --> 17:49.285
Push, push, push. Push.

17:49.329 --> 17:51.157
That's it.

17:52.680 --> 17:54.421
Oh, wow. Oh.

17:54.464 --> 17:56.118
Meet your daughter.

17:56.162 --> 17:58.077
Is she okay?

17:58.120 --> 17:59.687
Yeah, she's perfect.

17:59.730 --> 18:02.124
Would dad like to cut the cord?

18:02.168 --> 18:03.386
Yeah, I would.

18:03.430 --> 18:05.649
Yeah.Come over here.

18:05.693 --> 18:07.521
Thank you. Okay.Here you go.

18:07.564 --> 18:09.436
Right here? Okay.Yeah, right there.

18:09.479 --> 18:11.133
Little slippery.

18:11.177 --> 18:13.135
Good job, Dad.

18:13.179 --> 18:14.397
Thanks.You're a father.

18:14.441 --> 18:17.313
Oh, my God.

18:18.793 --> 18:21.056
BP's dropping.She's hemorrhaging.

18:21.100 --> 18:22.710
What do you mean, she's
hemorrhaging? What happening?She's losing blood, fast.

18:22.753 --> 18:25.669
Suzy. Hey.Run the IV wide open.
Let's get her some oxygen.

18:25.713 --> 18:27.671
Get him out of here.Suzy... Hey, hey. You okay?

18:27.715 --> 18:30.109
Mr. Wright, you need
to come with me.What? What's happening?

18:30.152 --> 18:31.153
Come on, Suzy,
stay with me.Suzy.

18:31.197 --> 18:33.068
What's going on?

18:35.157 --> 18:37.551
Call the rapid response team.
Come on, Suzy.

18:37.594 --> 18:39.770
Stay with us, Suzy.

18:49.215 --> 18:50.738
I'm in.

18:53.349 --> 18:55.612
Magnum, Gordon's just arrived.
You better hurry.

18:58.224 --> 19:01.792
Okay, you're looking
for server A2-6147.

19:01.836 --> 19:04.186
A2-6147...

19:04.230 --> 19:05.492
Okay.

19:08.973 --> 19:11.759
We're in.

19:13.456 --> 19:15.632
Now comes the hard part.

19:24.250 --> 19:27.601
Magnum, you got a tail. Looks
like your friend from the yard

19:27.644 --> 19:29.385
has followed you inside.

19:48.970 --> 19:50.580
It is you.

19:51.668 --> 19:52.800
What, are you undercover
on a case?

19:52.843 --> 19:54.802
Yeah.

19:54.845 --> 19:56.891
Working with the warden, so
don't say anything, all right?

19:56.934 --> 19:59.110
You do not want to get
on this guy's bad side.

19:59.154 --> 20:01.722
I'm losing four years
of my life 'cause of you.

20:01.765 --> 20:03.376
Hold on.

20:03.419 --> 20:05.465
Uh, some might argue that, uh,

20:05.508 --> 20:07.728
you're losing four years of your
life because you had a meth lab

20:07.771 --> 20:09.382
in your kitchen.

20:21.872 --> 20:23.570
Magnum, behind you.

20:33.580 --> 20:36.931
Black.
Three sugars.

20:36.974 --> 20:39.977
You remembered.
I'm touched.

20:44.939 --> 20:46.419
Ah.

20:46.462 --> 20:47.985
Nice of you to come
all the way out here.

20:48.029 --> 20:49.073
I really don't get visitors.

20:49.117 --> 20:51.206
That's not what
I hear. In fact,

20:51.250 --> 20:54.296
you had two recently, and they
traveled all the way from D.C.

20:54.340 --> 20:55.689
Who are you
about to roll on, Shane?

20:57.343 --> 20:58.822
Is that why you're here?

20:58.866 --> 21:01.260
What, you're hurt I didn't come
to you first? Let you have

21:01.303 --> 21:03.218
the collar?I'm here because
there's already been blowback.

21:04.480 --> 21:06.090
Beth's been taken.

21:08.049 --> 21:10.094
I just hope I'm not
gonna end up in here

21:10.138 --> 21:11.095
for what I'm about to do.

21:18.364 --> 21:20.757
What did you do, Gordie?

21:20.801 --> 21:22.324
What'd you put in here?

21:22.368 --> 21:24.021
Just something
to help you sleep.

21:33.379 --> 21:34.858
Guard.

21:37.774 --> 21:39.733
You're welcome.

21:44.955 --> 21:46.783
What happened to the gurney?

21:46.827 --> 21:48.089
I had to call
an audible.

21:48.132 --> 21:49.873
The plan was I get
a doctor's coat, we stick him

21:49.917 --> 21:51.440
on the gurney and catch
an ambulance out of here.

21:51.484 --> 21:53.268
Yeah, that was a great plan,
that plan is dead.

21:53.312 --> 21:55.792
Now there's a new plan.Terrific.
You care to loop me in?

21:55.836 --> 21:57.968
You don't trust me?You don't have a plan, do you?

21:58.012 --> 22:01.015
Does getting out of here
before the alarm goes off count?

22:01.058 --> 22:03.365
No, it does not. No.
Magnum, we have a problem.

22:03.409 --> 22:05.498
One of the security guards
has discovered your friends

22:05.541 --> 22:07.369
in the laundry room, and he's
called it in. The prison

22:07.413 --> 22:08.457
is about to go into lockdown.

22:08.501 --> 22:09.850
How much time
do we have?

22:11.155 --> 22:11.982
Come on.

22:18.511 --> 22:20.034
On the ground!
On the ground now!

22:26.693 --> 22:28.782
Two lines. LL in the front,

22:28.825 --> 22:30.087
Trevors in the back.

22:34.918 --> 22:36.398
Talk to me, Higgins.

22:36.442 --> 22:37.704
I'm working on an exfil.
Hold your position

22:37.747 --> 22:39.793
whilst I distract the guards.

22:39.836 --> 22:42.186
We're on lockdown.
My guys are mobilizing now.

22:43.840 --> 22:46.016
Hey, Sarge, look at the doors
on 1-A. They're rolling back.

22:46.060 --> 22:48.715
This is control center.
We have a code red

22:48.758 --> 22:51.413
in cell block A.Get to A-block. Move, move!

22:53.894 --> 22:55.635
Okay, all clear.

22:55.678 --> 22:56.679
Make your way down the hallway

22:56.723 --> 22:58.377
and I'll start
opening some doors.

23:09.997 --> 23:12.216
Hey. What's the latest?

23:12.260 --> 23:14.305
She's still in surgery.

23:14.349 --> 23:15.481
They can't stop the bleeding.

23:15.524 --> 23:16.786
Where's Rick?

23:24.751 --> 23:27.101
Thought they kept this
maternity ward locked up tight.

23:27.144 --> 23:28.885
One of the nurses

23:28.929 --> 23:31.540
is a distant cousin of mine.Mm.

23:31.584 --> 23:33.977
Oh.

23:34.021 --> 23:36.415
She's beautiful.

23:37.503 --> 23:39.983
I'm scared, Kumu.

23:40.027 --> 23:43.030
I never been
more scared in my life.

23:43.073 --> 23:46.250
And I've seen some scary stuff,
but this...

23:48.252 --> 23:49.428
...this is different.

23:50.472 --> 23:52.387
Listen to me.

23:52.431 --> 23:54.694
This little girl's mom
is a strong woman.

23:54.737 --> 23:58.437
She's a fighter who's struggled
her entire life.

23:58.480 --> 24:01.004
And she knows that there are
people waiting out here

24:01.048 --> 24:02.615
who love her.

24:02.658 --> 24:04.530
People who need her.

24:05.531 --> 24:07.489
But it's out of our hands now.

24:09.230 --> 24:10.623
You just look
after your daughter.

24:10.666 --> 24:12.929
That's the best thing
you can do for Suzy right now.

24:19.936 --> 24:21.372
Oh...

24:33.907 --> 24:35.474
Gordon,
what are you...

24:35.517 --> 24:37.084
Where the hell are we?

24:37.127 --> 24:39.260
We're outside
Schofield Barracks.

24:39.303 --> 24:41.523
About two miles from the prison.

24:41.567 --> 24:45.048
You... Wait.
You broke me out? Why?

24:45.092 --> 24:46.659
It was either that
or a bullet to the head.

24:47.747 --> 24:49.139
The people who took Beth

24:49.183 --> 24:51.228
sent me in to kill you.

24:51.272 --> 24:54.318
So, what, now you trade
me for her?

24:54.362 --> 24:56.625
No, actually, we're going
to use you as bait.

24:57.844 --> 24:59.410
Tell us who we're up against.

24:59.454 --> 25:01.064
Who were you about
to screw over?

25:03.371 --> 25:05.939
Ray Nasano.

25:08.594 --> 25:10.073
I'm guessing you know who he is.

25:11.422 --> 25:12.554
Ray's a big player

25:12.598 --> 25:13.947
in the ice trade.

25:13.990 --> 25:16.515
Shane and I tried to take
him down a while back.

25:16.558 --> 25:19.300
Chased him for a year.
Couldn't make anything stick.

25:19.343 --> 25:20.519
But what could you
possibly have on him now

25:20.562 --> 25:21.868
that we didn't have then?

25:22.912 --> 25:24.697
Thing is, I did have it.

25:24.740 --> 25:26.699
I had it then.

25:26.742 --> 25:28.483
I, uh, had some leverage

25:28.527 --> 25:31.268
on one of Ray's crew,
I turned him.

25:31.312 --> 25:33.488
He gave me the evidence

25:33.532 --> 25:35.272
we needed to bring Ray down.

25:35.316 --> 25:37.492
Except Ray paid you off.

25:39.581 --> 25:41.888
This happened

25:41.931 --> 25:43.237
right under my nose.
How'd I miss it?

25:45.674 --> 25:47.981
You were on emergency leave.

25:49.025 --> 25:50.113
When Kim died.

25:51.941 --> 25:52.855
That's your sister?

26:03.605 --> 26:05.215
Is it done?

26:05.259 --> 26:07.130
Change of plan.

26:07.174 --> 26:09.437
And you can drop the theatrics,
Ray. I know it's you.

26:11.004 --> 26:12.571
New terms.

26:12.614 --> 26:13.833
I've got Whelan.

26:13.876 --> 26:15.835
Say hi, Shane.

26:15.878 --> 26:17.793
Hi.

26:18.794 --> 26:20.361
Here's how

26:20.404 --> 26:21.405
this is gonna work.

26:21.449 --> 26:23.277
We meet, you get Whelan,

26:23.320 --> 26:24.626
Beth leaves with me.

26:34.723 --> 26:37.857
You know, the cop I remember

26:37.900 --> 26:40.076
didn't have such a hard time
following rules.

26:40.120 --> 26:42.731
Again, the man who can bury you

26:42.775 --> 26:44.994
in exchange for Beth.

26:56.876 --> 27:00.357
There's a quarry in Makakilo,
at the end of Palehua Road.

27:00.401 --> 27:02.490
Be there in one hour.

27:02.533 --> 27:04.144
Just you and Whelan.

27:04.187 --> 27:05.754
If I see anyone else--

27:05.798 --> 27:08.409
anyone else--

27:08.452 --> 27:12.326
well, you won't have to worry
about spousal support anymore.

27:16.896 --> 27:18.288
It's gonna be an ambush.

27:18.332 --> 27:20.682
Yeah. For them.

27:39.745 --> 27:41.181
What do you see?

27:41.224 --> 27:42.356
Three gunmen.
Problem is, a minute ago,

27:42.399 --> 27:43.705
there were four of them,
including Ray,

27:43.749 --> 27:45.098
who's now inside the car,
which means

27:45.141 --> 27:46.360
there's one of them
lying in wait somewhere.

27:46.403 --> 27:47.927
Means they
probably plan on

27:47.970 --> 27:50.146
taking you out as soon
as they have Whelan.

27:50.190 --> 27:51.931
Any idea where the fourth gunman
could've taken up position?

27:51.974 --> 27:53.715
High ground, good cover.
Maybe here?

27:53.759 --> 27:55.630
Yeah. Or there.

27:55.674 --> 27:56.675
Gonna have to split up.

27:57.763 --> 27:58.938
All right, you go in
with Whelan,

27:58.981 --> 28:00.026
we'll converge on foot.

28:00.069 --> 28:01.375
All right.
Watch yourselves, okay?

28:03.507 --> 28:04.683
Good luck.

28:04.726 --> 28:06.032
You too.

28:11.254 --> 28:13.169
Wait.

28:13.213 --> 28:14.562
There's something
you deserve to know.

28:14.605 --> 28:16.738
What?

28:16.782 --> 28:18.784
Back when we were
going after Ray,

28:18.827 --> 28:21.264
we were closer
than we even realized.

28:21.308 --> 28:23.223
But Ray couldn't just kill us,

28:23.266 --> 28:24.833
it would've drawn
too much attention.

28:24.877 --> 28:26.139
And he knew
you couldn't be bought,

28:26.182 --> 28:27.967
so he had to knock you
off your game.

28:28.010 --> 28:29.882
Hard.

28:30.926 --> 28:32.014
What are you saying?

28:33.886 --> 28:36.976
He saw to it that the heroin
your sister O.D.'d on

28:37.019 --> 28:39.065
was laced with fentanyl.

28:41.023 --> 28:42.764
No, that's not possible.
The autopsy would've...

28:42.808 --> 28:45.506
He paid the M.E.
to fake the results.

28:50.119 --> 28:52.556
You're saying he murdered Kim

28:52.600 --> 28:54.602
because we were
getting too close,

28:54.645 --> 28:56.386
and you knew
this whole time.

28:56.430 --> 28:58.475
No. I only found out after.

28:58.519 --> 29:00.347
But you still kept it from me.

29:00.390 --> 29:01.565
I had to keep my mouth shut,

29:01.609 --> 29:03.350
otherwise they would've
killed my family.

29:06.832 --> 29:08.050
Why are you telling me now?

29:09.704 --> 29:12.054
'Cause there's a chance
I'm not walking away from this.

29:14.056 --> 29:15.405
And if I'm gonna meet my maker,

29:15.449 --> 29:16.755
I want to do it
with a clear conscience.

30:22.168 --> 30:23.647
Put away the gun.

30:23.691 --> 30:25.084
Let me see Beth.

30:59.640 --> 31:02.599
Let's not make this complicated.
We each hold our positions.

31:02.643 --> 31:04.906
You send Beth, I send Whelan.

31:10.564 --> 31:12.740
Go.

32:01.310 --> 32:04.052
Drop the clip and put
the gun on the ground.

32:13.105 --> 32:14.367
Come on.

32:17.587 --> 32:19.938
Get down and stay down.

32:30.296 --> 32:32.080
Hey, pal.

32:32.124 --> 32:34.996
I'd like to say it's nice
to see you again, but...

32:35.040 --> 32:36.519
it's not.

32:47.052 --> 32:49.054
Take cover!Look out!

33:50.289 --> 33:52.465
Yeah.Where's Gordie?

33:52.508 --> 33:54.423
He went after Ray.

33:54.467 --> 33:56.034
Go.

34:13.660 --> 34:15.227
Guess you finally got me, huh?

34:15.270 --> 34:17.664
Look at me.

34:17.707 --> 34:20.319
Look at me!

34:20.362 --> 34:21.450
Gordie!

34:26.020 --> 34:27.891
He murdered Kim.
Laced the drugs with fentanyl.

34:29.763 --> 34:31.373
Okay. But it's over.

34:32.461 --> 34:33.897
We got him.

34:35.943 --> 34:37.945
Lower the weapon.

34:37.988 --> 34:39.468
Walk away, Magnum.

34:39.512 --> 34:41.862
I can't do that.

34:41.905 --> 34:44.647
And you can't do this.

34:44.691 --> 34:46.214
Just leave, damn it!

34:47.302 --> 34:49.043
I'm not going anywhere.

34:49.087 --> 34:52.394
If you want to pull that
trigger, you go ahead.

34:52.438 --> 34:56.181
I'll back up whatever version
of the story you want to tell.

34:57.878 --> 34:59.967
It's not gonna
bring Kim back, though.

35:01.621 --> 35:03.492
And if you do pull that
trigger, it's only gonna end

35:03.536 --> 35:05.190
in more pain, you know that.

35:05.233 --> 35:07.017
All right,
you know that

35:07.061 --> 35:10.238
because you've been exactly
where I'm standing right now.

35:12.588 --> 35:14.590
Come on, Gordie.

35:42.618 --> 35:46.274
Oh, you're gonna break
a lot of hearts.

35:46.318 --> 35:48.189
I've only known you
less than an hour

35:48.233 --> 35:49.625
and you already have me
wrapped around

35:49.669 --> 35:51.236
those tiny little fingers.

36:00.810 --> 36:02.160
Hi.Hey.

36:04.162 --> 36:07.861
Aw, she's so beautiful.

36:07.904 --> 36:09.210
You want to hold her?

36:09.254 --> 36:10.472
Yes.

36:10.516 --> 36:12.039
Just be careful with her neck.

36:12.082 --> 36:14.389
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

36:14.433 --> 36:15.825
She's so tiny.

36:19.177 --> 36:20.178
What's her name?

36:20.221 --> 36:22.049
Um...

36:22.092 --> 36:24.051
We haven't, uh...

36:24.094 --> 36:25.444
We hadn't decided yet.

36:25.487 --> 36:27.446
Uh...

36:27.489 --> 36:30.231
We're waiting on, uh...

36:30.275 --> 36:32.320
What do the doctors say?

36:32.364 --> 36:35.889
Uh, nothing yet.

36:35.932 --> 36:38.457
I got to say,

36:38.500 --> 36:40.720
when Suzy shut me down,

36:40.763 --> 36:44.202
I regretted telling her
how I felt about her, but...

36:44.245 --> 36:45.942
now I'm glad she knows.

36:47.292 --> 36:48.728
Yeah.

36:51.600 --> 36:53.559
I'm sorry we couldn't
be here earlier.

36:53.602 --> 36:54.864
Yeah.Well, there's nothing

36:54.908 --> 36:57.084
you could've done.

36:57.127 --> 36:58.216
How's Beth?

36:58.259 --> 36:59.434
Yeah, she's all right.

36:59.478 --> 37:00.653
And Katsumoto?

37:01.784 --> 37:02.916
He's got...

37:03.960 --> 37:05.745
...a lot of things
to answer for.

37:13.448 --> 37:14.623
Hey.

37:14.667 --> 37:17.713
I, uh, heard
what happened today.

37:17.757 --> 37:19.149
Are you okay?

37:19.193 --> 37:22.240
Beth is.
That's all that matters.

37:23.328 --> 37:25.591
Lieutenant come down
hard on you?

37:25.634 --> 37:29.290
Suspended indefinitely
without pay, but...

37:29.334 --> 37:31.684
they'll probably take my badge.

37:31.727 --> 37:33.729
I'm so sorry, Gordon.

37:33.773 --> 37:36.515
Hey, don't be. I'm not.

37:37.559 --> 37:39.387
I did what I had to.

37:41.389 --> 37:43.522
Really. It's all right.

37:44.958 --> 37:46.002
Just take care
of yourself, okay?

38:17.599 --> 38:19.819
Doc, how is she?

38:24.389 --> 38:25.825
You gave us all one
hell of a scare.

38:25.868 --> 38:27.740
How you feeling?

38:27.783 --> 38:30.220
I'm all right. Just tired.

38:30.264 --> 38:32.092
You should be.

38:32.135 --> 38:33.180
You worked so hard.

38:33.223 --> 38:34.747
Did so good.

38:36.226 --> 38:37.576
Here she is.

38:40.361 --> 38:42.624
Oh...

38:42.668 --> 38:44.104
Thank you.

38:46.367 --> 38:48.326
Let me see this girl.

38:50.458 --> 38:51.546
What are you gonna call her?

38:52.634 --> 38:54.984
How about Joy?

38:55.028 --> 38:56.508
Joy Frankie.

38:56.551 --> 38:58.597
For Icepick.

39:00.512 --> 39:01.817
That's perfect.Yeah.

39:01.861 --> 39:03.341
She's beautiful.He would really love

39:03.384 --> 39:04.516
this little girl.

39:04.559 --> 39:06.387
Look at that little face.Hello, Joy.

39:06.431 --> 39:08.084
- Do you see your uncles?- Hello.

39:08.128 --> 39:09.303
Hi.

39:09.347 --> 39:11.131
These will be

39:11.174 --> 39:12.437
your crazy uncles.

39:12.480 --> 39:14.700
That's right.

39:14.743 --> 39:17.355
Oh, God, you're a
lovely little girl.

39:50.475 --> 39:52.128
Hey.

39:52.172 --> 39:53.391
Hey.

39:53.434 --> 39:54.914
You all right?

39:54.957 --> 39:57.830
Uh, yeah. Yeah.

39:57.873 --> 39:59.309
Why'd you leave?

40:00.833 --> 40:02.704
Just...

40:02.748 --> 40:05.620
suddenly got a bit overwhelmed.

40:05.664 --> 40:07.317
Guess it's been

40:07.361 --> 40:09.494
an emotional day, you know?

40:09.537 --> 40:12.540
Yeah. Yeah, it has.

40:12.584 --> 40:15.064
Gordie's situation,

40:15.108 --> 40:17.806
Suzy and the baby.

40:17.850 --> 40:19.417
It's a lot.

40:21.506 --> 40:23.856
Actually, uh...

40:23.899 --> 40:25.205
I'm lying.

40:25.248 --> 40:26.598
I'm-I'm not all right.

40:26.641 --> 40:28.469
Um...

40:28.513 --> 40:30.863
There is something else.

40:30.906 --> 40:34.693
So, when I came
to talk to you today...Mm-hmm.

40:34.736 --> 40:38.436
It wasn't about work.

40:38.479 --> 40:40.438
I wanted to tell you something.

40:40.481 --> 40:45.007
And then I saw Lia there,
and I just couldn't.

40:47.532 --> 40:50.012
Well, now I know
nothing happened,

40:50.056 --> 40:52.014
and, uh,

40:52.058 --> 40:55.540
I have to tell you,
because it's...

40:55.583 --> 40:58.020
it's just gonna
haunt me otherwise.

41:01.328 --> 41:04.549
So I came to tell you...

41:06.812 --> 41:09.162
...that I have, uh,

41:09.205 --> 41:11.207
feelings for you.

41:12.339 --> 41:13.514
I tried to deny it,

41:13.558 --> 41:15.864
and I just can't anymore.

41:18.998 --> 41:20.260
Yeah. Right.

41:20.303 --> 41:23.916
I bet this is just doing
wonders for your ego.

41:23.959 --> 41:27.920
No, no, it's... it's not that.

41:27.963 --> 41:29.791
Then what is it?

41:31.576 --> 41:34.753
When you were
in the wine cellar yesterday,

41:34.796 --> 41:38.321
I wanted to spend
the day with you...

41:38.365 --> 41:41.673
because I wanted
to say the same thing.

41:41.716 --> 41:43.979
But you had plans
with Cole and...

41:44.023 --> 41:45.459
Wait, what?

41:49.855 --> 41:52.074
I have feelings for you.

41:54.076 --> 41:56.383
I think I have for a while.

41:56.426 --> 41:59.821
I just didn't know it.

42:03.912 --> 42:05.131
Oh.

42:09.570 --> 42:12.791
I mean, of course,
I have my reservations.

42:12.834 --> 42:15.228
So do I. Yeah.

42:16.534 --> 42:18.536
I don't want to risk
losing our friendship,

42:18.579 --> 42:20.581
o-our partnership, and...

42:22.627 --> 42:25.586
...maybe we shouldn't go there.

42:25.630 --> 42:26.805
I think you're right.

42:29.155 --> 42:31.461
We probably shouldn't.

42:31.505 --> 42:35.204
Right. Yeah.
