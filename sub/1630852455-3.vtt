00:34.600 --> 00:35.440
Look at that!

00:36.280 --> 00:39.360
-Are you thinking what I'm thinking?
-Let's find out.

00:39.440 --> 00:41.360
Yes, great minds!

00:41.440 --> 00:44.000
-Here it comes. Wait for it. And…

01:18.200 --> 01:20.040
-My hand! I touched your breast.

01:20.120 --> 01:22.760
-So sorry! Apologies. Forgive me.
-It's okay.

01:22.840 --> 01:24.440
No, no, I was too close.

01:24.520 --> 01:26.840
-Really, really, it's fine.

01:27.600 --> 01:29.680
-Are you sure?

01:29.760 --> 01:30.720
Of course.

01:31.480 --> 01:32.640
Hey!

01:33.880 --> 01:35.680
Okay as an accident.
Not if it's intentional.

01:39.040 --> 01:40.520
-Thank you.

01:40.600 --> 01:41.680
We made a pledge.

01:42.760 --> 01:44.600
-We did.
-So we keep it.

01:46.240 --> 01:48.440
-Yes.
-And do what we came to do.

02:56.440 --> 02:58.960
Jordan! Jordan!

03:00.400 --> 03:01.440
Jordan!

03:01.520 --> 03:03.800
Kasai, have you seen Jordan?

03:03.880 --> 03:05.440
No, sorry.

03:09.800 --> 03:13.040
-Laura?
-He's back. He's here, and he's fine.

03:16.240 --> 03:17.640
Where has he been? Put him on!

03:17.720 --> 03:19.200
She wants to talk to you.

03:20.920 --> 03:23.480
-Mum?
-Where have you been? Who were you with?

03:23.560 --> 03:26.080
<i> It was a gaming company.</i>
<i>They're looking for testers.</i>

03:26.160 --> 03:27.920
It's official. I've got a letter for you.

03:28.000 --> 03:29.280
-Stay until I get back!

03:29.360 --> 03:31.480
-In fact, you're grounded!
-<i>What?</i>

03:33.840 --> 03:35.800
-Frances.
-<i> He's back again.</i>

03:36.320 --> 03:38.400
-Who?
-The man who comes in my room.

03:39.000 --> 03:40.120
<i>He's here.</i>

03:40.800 --> 03:43.440
Frances, one of us
will come over right now.

05:01.400 --> 05:02.240
Sorry.

05:05.520 --> 05:07.000
Yeah!

05:07.640 --> 05:08.560
Whoo!

05:08.640 --> 05:10.640
Might play that again!

05:13.080 --> 05:14.720
-Will you--
-Yes!

05:14.800 --> 05:16.600
-You don't know what I'm gonna say!
-Aah!

05:20.040 --> 05:22.520
-One more. Don't move. Don't move.

05:25.960 --> 05:28.160
-What?
-Nothing.

05:38.040 --> 05:38.880
Hello?

05:39.640 --> 05:42.560
Oh, uh… Hi, yeah. Yeah, I'm on my way now.

05:46.280 --> 05:48.600
-Sorry. Sorry I'm late.
-Come on, guys.

05:49.120 --> 05:53.160
I want each of you
to take a photograph of that wall,

05:53.240 --> 05:57.480
but it has to be a picture that you
would be proud to show the rest of us.

06:05.760 --> 06:08.560
-Let's give that a little wipe.
-Oh, thank you.

06:09.080 --> 06:11.040
Have a look. Yeah, yeah, just level it.

06:11.880 --> 06:15.960
All right, so being a photographer
is all about making choices.

06:16.040 --> 06:18.240
It's about what you choose to show

06:18.320 --> 06:21.160
and what you choose to not show.

06:21.800 --> 06:25.520
Because actually, you're trying
to take the viewer inside your head

06:25.600 --> 06:29.280
for the blink of an eye and maybe let them

06:30.200 --> 06:34.280
see what you see and… feel what you feel.

06:35.440 --> 06:36.960
These are good.

06:37.920 --> 06:38.840
Yep.

06:47.080 --> 06:48.840
-Who took this one?
-Me.

06:51.360 --> 06:52.560
It's really great.

06:52.640 --> 06:55.440
You've chosen part of a photo
and then gone in so close

06:55.520 --> 06:57.440
you're forcing me to look at it,

06:57.520 --> 06:59.880
and that is what makes a great photograph.

07:00.800 --> 07:01.880
Tell me about it.

07:01.960 --> 07:03.880
She looks so happy.

07:03.960 --> 07:07.120
I think it's 'cause she knows
she's gonna go on that big ride.

07:07.200 --> 07:10.760
And even when you get this close,
you still get that somehow.

07:11.720 --> 07:13.680
-Oh! Ray!
-No, no, please.

07:13.760 --> 07:15.480
-Just look into the light.
-You're so…

07:16.560 --> 07:18.560
Perfect. Just look into the light.

07:20.600 --> 07:21.440
Yeah.

07:24.080 --> 07:25.920
All right, we'll do more next week.

07:30.440 --> 07:31.520
Wow!

07:31.600 --> 07:34.160
-Rishi!
-That's the woman from my photo!

07:34.240 --> 07:36.520
-That's the same woman, isn't it?
-Yeah, well-spotted.

07:36.600 --> 07:39.440
You've got so many of them.
Is she your girlfriend?

07:39.520 --> 07:40.360
-Rishi.
-Is she?

07:40.440 --> 07:42.720
-Rishi, that's enough.
-No, it's okay.

07:42.800 --> 07:45.160
Yeah, she is your girlfriend, isn't she?

07:45.880 --> 07:48.160
-She was, yeah.
-What's her name?

07:49.600 --> 07:50.760
Cassie.

07:51.680 --> 07:54.880
-That is all you're getting for today.
-Ready? Rishi, come on.

07:54.960 --> 07:57.480
-You should put one of those on the wall.
-Yeah, right.

07:57.560 --> 07:59.280
What's this one? Why is it white?

07:59.360 --> 08:01.400
-That's enough.
-Come on, it's time to go.

08:02.520 --> 08:03.520
Fine.

08:42.960 --> 08:44.800
-Harry.
-I'm all done.

08:45.640 --> 08:48.640
-Where are you?
-I had to head home. We had a scare.

08:49.160 --> 08:51.000
Are you okay? Do you need Mike Broome?

08:51.080 --> 08:53.480
-I can call him any time.
-No, Harry, listen.

08:54.440 --> 08:55.480
No police.

08:56.360 --> 08:57.400
False alarm.

08:57.480 --> 08:59.880
Well, I managed to track down
Stewart Green's accountant,

08:59.960 --> 09:03.280
and he says there were rumors

09:03.360 --> 09:06.600
that Green had stashed away
considerable amounts of cash

09:06.680 --> 09:08.280
<i>prior to his disappearance.</i>

09:08.960 --> 09:11.320
<i>-Is that what you've heard?</i>
-No, nothing.

09:11.880 --> 09:15.280
Well, you did wonder
whether Green came back for money,

09:15.360 --> 09:18.400
so perhaps he was coming back
for this cash and not for you.

09:20.120 --> 09:20.960
<i>Cassie?</i>

09:21.480 --> 09:22.400
-Yeah.

09:23.920 --> 09:26.000
-Harry, I have to go.
-<i> Yeah. All right.</i>

09:32.160 --> 09:33.440
-Careful!
-Okay.

09:33.520 --> 09:35.040
He might have slipped back in!

09:35.120 --> 09:37.280
All right, Frances, I'm sure it's nothing.

09:37.800 --> 09:38.920
Let's go in, okay?

09:44.640 --> 09:47.640
-There's no one here.
-Behind the curtains?

09:50.480 --> 09:51.320
No.

09:55.760 --> 09:57.000
The cupboard.

09:58.320 --> 09:59.680
Okay, I'll have a look.

10:01.840 --> 10:03.960
It's empty. There's… there's no one there.

10:04.040 --> 10:05.560
I said you were coming.

10:05.640 --> 10:08.800
That's why he's left.
I said, "Megan's coming."

10:09.320 --> 10:12.760
He said, "Who's Megan?"
So I showed him your photo. Then he said,

10:13.840 --> 10:14.960
"Well, that's Cassie!"

10:22.520 --> 10:24.520
And what did this man look like?

10:25.680 --> 10:26.680
Mmm…

10:27.360 --> 10:29.040
Very well turned out.

10:29.680 --> 10:31.000
Very smart.

10:31.600 --> 10:33.480
Very shiny shoes.

10:37.040 --> 10:38.120
And a shaved head?

10:40.040 --> 10:41.840
You know who it is, don't you?

10:47.480 --> 10:48.520
Cassie?

10:51.120 --> 10:53.120
-Are you all right, sweetheart?
-Frances.

10:54.320 --> 10:56.160
We've talked about this before.

10:58.720 --> 11:01.280
You mustn't call me Cassie.

11:02.720 --> 11:05.200
Okay,
so Carlton Flynn was standing here.

11:10.800 --> 11:13.680
What on earth is he doing
all the way out here

11:15.000 --> 11:16.600
in the middle of the night?

11:22.200 --> 11:26.240
And this… this is where the blood was.

11:26.320 --> 11:27.600
"Was" being the operative word.

11:27.680 --> 11:29.800
It's been raining.
Could have been washed away.

11:29.880 --> 11:33.840
Here, take soil samples
to cross-check with Carlton Flynn's DNA.

11:33.920 --> 11:37.360
-Sir.
-Question is, who sent these and why?

11:37.440 --> 11:39.840
-What are they doing? What do they want?

11:42.200 --> 11:46.160
Okay, so Carlton Flynn's car
has been clocked 15 miles up the road.

11:46.240 --> 11:49.200
They're lookin' for him there.
We're takin' samples here.

11:49.800 --> 11:51.480
Let's go see Guy Tatum's girlfriend.

11:51.560 --> 11:53.960
He's the latest missing person.
She reported it.

11:55.680 --> 11:58.720
Something's goin' on.
Something's gotta give.

12:06.120 --> 12:06.960
Jordan!

12:07.800 --> 12:09.200
-Oh!
-Look, see?

12:09.280 --> 12:12.040
There's the letter the man gave me.
I haven't opened it.

12:12.120 --> 12:15.600
It's real. It's official!
They use young people to play the games.

12:16.320 --> 12:19.640
You knew you didn't have your phone.
You knew I couldn't get in touch with you.

12:19.720 --> 12:22.280
Your dad is gonna go crazy
when he hears about this.

12:22.360 --> 12:23.280
Mum, don't tell Dad.

12:24.440 --> 12:25.280
Mum!

12:42.480 --> 12:44.000
Mum, don't tell him, please.

12:46.120 --> 12:47.800
-Hi, all.

12:53.000 --> 12:54.840
What's the matter? What's happenin'?

12:56.040 --> 12:56.880
Is it my mother?

12:58.400 --> 13:00.040
-Yeah.

13:00.120 --> 13:03.320
She keeps saying
there's someone in her room.

13:03.400 --> 13:05.600
And we keep saying there isn't,
like we don't believe her.

13:05.680 --> 13:07.080
Well, we don't.

13:07.160 --> 13:08.480
Well, maybe we should.

13:09.280 --> 13:11.040
Maybe someone <i>is </i>going in there.

13:11.600 --> 13:14.520
Or maybe she's imagining it.
Or maybe she's just lonely.

13:14.600 --> 13:17.560
Whichever it is, Dave,
she is not happy there.

13:18.840 --> 13:22.160
So we should move her
to somewhere she feels more secure.

13:23.280 --> 13:25.640
Look, I'll go and sit with her tonight.

13:26.480 --> 13:30.880
-No, I should be the one.
-No, listen, you… you stay here.

13:30.960 --> 13:34.160
Feed this lot and watch a movie together.

13:35.480 --> 13:37.120
Okay, I mean, if you're sure.

13:39.640 --> 13:40.480
I am.

13:48.120 --> 13:49.080
Simona Farr?

13:50.200 --> 13:51.200
Yeah.

13:56.320 --> 13:58.120
How long have
you and Guy been together?

13:58.200 --> 14:00.200
Not long. About a year.

14:01.320 --> 14:04.880
Yeah. This could be
his way of backing out.

14:07.480 --> 14:08.920
When did you last see him?

14:09.000 --> 14:10.000
Uh…

14:16.400 --> 14:19.840
-Is she havin' the fuckin' baby?
-No! She's upset.

14:21.160 --> 14:22.680
-Sorry.
-No, no, no.

14:23.200 --> 14:25.800
I cry at everything since this.

14:26.400 --> 14:28.880
-It's understandable.
-Yeah, but that's me.

14:30.320 --> 14:32.800
-I'm not used to it.
-You're a sergeant?

14:32.880 --> 14:34.640
-Staff sergeant.
-Right.

14:36.040 --> 14:40.480
Yeah, um…
I last saw Guy on Friday afternoon.

14:41.080 --> 14:42.400
-How was he?

14:42.480 --> 14:45.160
Him and his mates were heading into town
to party.

14:45.240 --> 14:47.000
I would say they were up for it.

14:47.080 --> 14:49.400
-What does he do? What's his job?
-Builder.

14:50.120 --> 14:53.960
-He can look after himself.
-Can we have the names of those workmates?

14:54.040 --> 14:54.880
Sure.

14:57.760 --> 15:00.080
-Off to the builders' yard, then?
-Yeah, okay.

15:03.600 --> 15:04.440
DS Broome.

15:04.960 --> 15:06.320
<i>DS Broome.</i>

15:07.200 --> 15:09.200
-Oh, hi.
-<i> Is this convenient?</i>

15:09.720 --> 15:10.560
Of course.

15:10.640 --> 15:13.640
Only, uh, Rudy just called to make sure

15:13.720 --> 15:16.160
his recorder had been returned.

15:16.240 --> 15:17.320
Ah, f…

15:17.840 --> 15:18.960
I'll bring it over.

15:19.040 --> 15:22.240
Yeah, I was wondering
if you wanted to drop it off at my place?

15:23.440 --> 15:25.920
If you can remember
where I live, that is.

15:26.440 --> 15:28.280
-Absolutely.
-<i> End of the day okay?</i>

15:28.880 --> 15:30.000
I'll do it personally.

15:30.520 --> 15:31.520
Leave it with me.

15:32.120 --> 15:33.480
<i>See you, bye.</i>

15:35.080 --> 15:37.640
That CCTV recorder,
I wish I'd never taken it.

15:37.720 --> 15:38.840
I can return it for you.

15:39.720 --> 15:42.960
No, uh… No, no, uh… No, you're grand.

15:43.040 --> 15:46.640
You drop me, and I'll, uh, get someone
to do the builders' yard with you.

16:39.760 --> 16:40.920
Ray Levine.

16:41.800 --> 16:42.880
Hi…

16:45.800 --> 16:48.000
-Lorraine.
-Mm-hmm.

16:49.640 --> 16:50.960
Are you okay?

16:52.840 --> 16:55.080
-A long time since I've been in here.
-Yeah.

16:56.680 --> 16:58.880
So, what can I do for you?

17:00.200 --> 17:03.200
I'm looking for someone.
His name's Guy Tatum.

17:05.360 --> 17:07.480
When I say
I haven't been here for a while,

17:07.560 --> 17:10.080
I was in town with this Guy Tatum
on Friday, and…

17:11.200 --> 17:14.960
I just have
zero recall of the night,

17:15.040 --> 17:17.760
but… the photos that I… I took

17:17.840 --> 17:20.440
show that we came in here.

17:23.320 --> 17:24.560
Hmm.

17:25.320 --> 17:27.040
Carnival's always crowded.

17:28.480 --> 17:30.360
Send me a copy, and I'll ask around.

17:30.880 --> 17:31.760
Thanks.

17:34.640 --> 17:35.920
Did you ever hear from Cassie?

17:41.720 --> 17:42.880
You have.

17:42.960 --> 17:43.960
-No, I--
-Please.

17:44.720 --> 17:46.640
I can see that you've heard from her.

17:48.680 --> 17:50.120
-Tell me.

17:53.800 --> 17:54.640
Okay.

17:59.080 --> 18:01.600
About five or six years ago,

18:02.720 --> 18:05.280
Cassie called out of the blue
to say she was sick.

18:09.600 --> 18:11.880
She had cervical cancer with secondaries.

18:13.800 --> 18:15.200
She wouldn't say where she was.

18:15.280 --> 18:18.720
She didn't want anyone
to see her like that, but I, uh…

18:20.960 --> 18:22.880
I rang the number back about a week later,

18:22.960 --> 18:26.040
and somebody from the hospice
where she was answered.

18:30.040 --> 18:32.560
And they told me
that Cassie had died that morning.

18:33.160 --> 18:34.000
No.

18:35.200 --> 18:36.880
I'm really sorry, Ray.

19:01.040 --> 19:03.600
Oh,
where's me fucking recorder?

19:03.680 --> 19:04.920
I'm onto it!

19:33.640 --> 19:34.560
Here we are.

19:34.640 --> 19:38.240
This is where he started coming after us.
It looks so different in the daylight.

19:38.320 --> 19:40.600
I thought we wouldn't get here
till midnight.

19:44.000 --> 19:46.400
When a jogger overtakes you,
you're driving too slow!

19:46.480 --> 19:51.400
Uh, I drive safely. I got us here!
And that jogger was at the traffic lights.

19:51.480 --> 19:53.360
Traffic lights on green. It took forever.

19:53.440 --> 19:57.600
Anyway, that's where we ran in,
because he chased us across here. Come on!

20:12.040 --> 20:13.760
Are we sure about this?

20:13.840 --> 20:16.200
Think of Carlton
at the bottom of a drop

20:16.280 --> 20:18.760
with a broken leg and concussion.

20:18.840 --> 20:21.120
-Or impaled on railings, or just--
-Yes, okay!

20:24.280 --> 20:25.640
Oh, this is where we split.

20:26.320 --> 20:30.320
'Cause I came up here,
and you two must have gone that way.

20:34.240 --> 20:35.080
Go on, then.

20:49.200 --> 20:51.280
-What are you doing?
-He's not down there.

20:51.360 --> 20:52.360
Don't do that!

20:53.960 --> 20:56.080
This is where he nearly caught me.

20:58.000 --> 20:59.960
When I fucking find you…

21:00.640 --> 21:02.080
So Carlton was here?

21:02.160 --> 21:04.440
-Can we get out of here?
-Is this where he was?

21:04.520 --> 21:08.440
-I didn't actually see him!
-Weren't you at Vipers the other night?

21:18.880 --> 21:22.080
-Come on!
-Stop, I just wanna talk!

21:22.160 --> 21:23.000
Hurry up!

21:23.600 --> 21:24.520
Stop!

21:47.920 --> 21:51.160
Come on! Vipers is on the way
to the builders' yard.

21:51.240 --> 21:54.560
We could drop the recorder off.
But you don't want to, do you? Eh?

21:54.640 --> 21:58.280
Why is that, hmm? I'll tell you why.
You're meeting Lorraine Griggs.

21:58.360 --> 22:00.320
-No, I'm not.
-Yes, you are. It's classic Broome.

22:00.400 --> 22:01.280
You always go back.

22:01.360 --> 22:03.760
You're the guy who says goodbye
and then never actually leaves.

22:03.840 --> 22:06.320
-Don't know what you're talking about.
-Sarah Green, for example.

22:06.400 --> 22:08.640
-How many times was that?
-That was years ago.

22:08.720 --> 22:11.920
But it does happen with women.
As soon as you're in, you're off.

22:12.000 --> 22:15.000
You're gone, only to return again.
Happens every time.

22:15.080 --> 22:17.960
You'll be a long time waiting.
Uh, excuse me, what's this?

22:18.040 --> 22:19.400
-What are you doing?
-Working?

22:19.480 --> 22:20.720
This is my desk!

22:20.800 --> 22:24.520
Uh, yeah, no. We hot-desk now. We share.
We don't have our own desks anymore.

22:24.600 --> 22:27.800
What the fuck are you talking about?
This is mine. My stuff was here! What…

22:27.880 --> 22:30.520
-Who put my things there?
-Goldberg did.

22:30.600 --> 22:34.480
Clear your stuff away.
Oi, you, put that biscuit down. Away!

22:36.720 --> 22:37.680
Are you listening to me?

22:38.880 --> 22:40.520
This, here,

22:41.480 --> 22:47.640
is… Broome's… desk!

22:49.560 --> 22:50.520
That's indelible.

22:50.600 --> 22:52.720
-Good. Put my things back.
-Oh, come on, Broome!

22:52.800 --> 22:57.400
-Don't you have a builders' yard to go to?
-Broome. Broome! If you could join us?

22:58.000 --> 23:00.760
-Come on, get on with it.

23:05.120 --> 23:07.720
-Let's go to the canteen-- Oh.

23:07.800 --> 23:09.080
-Goldberg.

23:10.200 --> 23:13.080
Yes, sir. No, no, no,
traveling as we speak.

23:13.160 --> 23:16.680
Right away. Yeah, yeah, fill me in.
Sorry. Back in a minute.

23:17.680 --> 23:19.760
Um… I'm gonna be blunt, okay?

23:20.280 --> 23:23.320
Because clearly you don't appreciate
how important my son is to me.

23:23.400 --> 23:26.360
-Mr. Flynn, can I stop you right there?
-No, you can't. No.

23:26.440 --> 23:29.520
Because you've not come up
with one significant lead yet. Not one!

23:29.600 --> 23:32.280
Mr. Flynn, we are doing
everything we can to find Carlton--

23:32.360 --> 23:36.120
And it's not enough. Not nearly enough!
Consequently, I am putting up

23:36.200 --> 23:39.280
a £100,000 reward for information
that leads to Carlton being found.

23:39.360 --> 23:42.360
Put that much up, and we'll be inundated
with completely useless sightings.

23:42.440 --> 23:45.120
We'll have to process them.
No one can, because everyone's so busy!

23:45.200 --> 23:46.480
I'm putting up the money!

23:46.560 --> 23:48.840
We'll get possible sightings
from <i>before </i>he went missing.

23:48.920 --> 23:50.680
-It's too soon!
-No, I'm doing it!

23:59.840 --> 24:01.480
For your little rendezvous.

25:17.400 --> 25:18.240
Hello?

25:35.080 --> 25:35.920
Hello.

25:44.520 --> 25:46.880
-Sorry.
-No, no. Uh…

25:47.440 --> 25:49.280
-It's very nice.
-Sure?

25:50.040 --> 25:50.960
Certain.

25:51.040 --> 25:56.240
Okay. Well, Rudy really does want
that back, so we don't have a lot of time.

25:56.320 --> 25:59.200
But if we are singing
from the same song sheet,

25:59.280 --> 26:00.360
I was thinking--

26:00.440 --> 26:01.560
We could skip the intro?

26:01.640 --> 26:03.080
Maybe even cut to the chorus.

26:03.160 --> 26:05.680
Which, as I remember, was very catchy.

26:51.400 --> 26:52.240
Yeah?

26:52.960 --> 26:54.400
That policeman of yours,

26:55.560 --> 26:56.640
Mike Broome?

26:56.720 --> 26:59.240
I need him. I need to see him tonight.

27:02.400 --> 27:04.600
Harry? Are you okay?

27:05.640 --> 27:08.520
Yeah.
You want to talk to Mike Broome.

27:08.600 --> 27:09.440
<i>Yeah.</i>

27:09.520 --> 27:11.280
I can be there by 8:30.

27:12.080 --> 27:13.400
I'm doing it.

27:35.360 --> 27:36.760
Do you need to get that?

27:37.840 --> 27:38.800
No.

27:42.320 --> 27:45.560
<i> This is DS Michael Broome.</i>
<i>Leave a message. I'll get back to you.</i>

27:49.920 --> 27:52.520
-When I woke up this morning--
-Who'd have thought?

27:52.600 --> 27:55.440
-Why didn't it work out the last time?
-You got married.

27:55.520 --> 27:56.360
Oh, yeah.

27:59.240 --> 28:00.120
How is that?

28:00.720 --> 28:02.720
Uh… Pfft. We're divorced.

28:03.920 --> 28:05.320
We're still partners, though.

28:05.400 --> 28:08.480
No, at work. Not in any other way.

28:09.240 --> 28:11.600
-She's a policewoman.
-Yeah, I remember.

28:11.680 --> 28:17.520
So relationship-wise,
I'm unattached… looking for trouble.

28:21.640 --> 28:23.120
So, where do we go from here?

28:24.880 --> 28:25.960
I'm going to work.

28:30.160 --> 28:31.000
Oh, God.

28:37.560 --> 28:38.400
Nice pic.

28:39.400 --> 28:41.520
Yeah, they're my current girls.

28:41.600 --> 28:42.560
A good bunch.

28:42.640 --> 28:44.880
I really liked her. Tawny.

28:44.960 --> 28:47.200
Yeah, she's great. I'm gonna miss her.

28:48.000 --> 28:49.520
She'll make a good nurse, though.

28:50.360 --> 28:51.200
Mmm.

29:41.760 --> 29:44.960
-Want anything before you go?
-What are you offering?

29:45.040 --> 29:46.520
What do you fancy?

29:58.560 --> 29:59.720
My sister was on these.

30:02.480 --> 30:04.160
What did she have?

30:05.920 --> 30:07.320
Cervical cancer.

30:29.240 --> 30:30.720
Just take it.

30:34.000 --> 30:34.840
Yes?

30:38.320 --> 30:39.160
I'm on my way.

30:41.360 --> 30:42.440
Go, it's not a problem.

30:42.520 --> 30:45.320
It's actually a good way out.
You know, you're just gone.

30:45.400 --> 30:48.880
Whoosh, never happened. No one's hurt.

30:50.800 --> 30:52.000
I am going.

30:52.680 --> 30:53.840
I have to go.

30:55.200 --> 30:56.480
But I'll be back.

30:57.800 --> 30:59.000
-I'll be back.

31:01.160 --> 31:03.080
Not everything has to end badly.

31:24.240 --> 31:27.680
Location of the body
was called in from a public phone box.

31:27.760 --> 31:29.160
They found one that worked?

31:30.040 --> 31:33.120
Male voice, muffled. Thank you.

31:33.200 --> 31:34.760
Okay, guys, stand back.

31:39.720 --> 31:41.360
It's Guy Tatum, right?

31:41.440 --> 31:42.480
Yes.

31:43.160 --> 31:45.520
Someone needs to tell
his girlfriend, Simona.

31:46.600 --> 31:49.400
-Any chance she's a suspect?
-She's eight months pregnant.

31:49.480 --> 31:52.200
She's also a staff sergeant,
combat experience.

31:52.800 --> 31:55.200
Update, please. Is it Carlton Flynn?

31:55.280 --> 31:56.960
-Guy Tatum.

32:12.120 --> 32:14.320
-Time of death?
-We'd have to run some tests.

32:14.400 --> 32:16.040
-From what his partner said…

32:16.120 --> 32:19.640
…that's what he was wearing last time
she saw him, and that was four days ago.

32:20.680 --> 32:21.520
Harry?

32:22.600 --> 32:25.120
<i> Sorry for the short notice,</i>
<i>but can you talk to Cassie?</i>

32:25.200 --> 32:26.440
What time and where?

32:26.520 --> 32:28.720
<i> Just north of the pier, okay?</i>

32:28.800 --> 32:29.800
Yeah. I'll be there.

32:33.120 --> 32:34.680
-Guess who I'm gonna meet.
-Who?

32:34.760 --> 32:38.360
Do you remember Cassie Morris?
Think! Cassie Morris, Stewart Green.

32:40.360 --> 32:42.120
-His bit on the side?
-Mm-hmm.

32:42.200 --> 32:44.560
Developments, yeah? Who was on the phone?

32:45.520 --> 32:48.560
Harry Sutton.
He's offering us a possible witness.

32:48.640 --> 32:49.840
To what? For this?

32:50.360 --> 32:51.960
-Uh…
-For the Carlton Flynn case?

32:52.600 --> 32:55.440
-Could be connected to both. I should go.
-Yeah, go, go.

33:07.960 --> 33:08.920
Cassie.

33:09.000 --> 33:12.200
Harry, I'm here in town.
What's happening? Are we on?

33:12.280 --> 33:15.160
<i>Yep.</i>
<i>Just north of the pier.</i>

33:15.240 --> 33:17.160
Okay? On the seafront.

33:17.240 --> 33:18.680
<i>At 8:30.</i>

33:18.760 --> 33:21.920
Okay, I'll see you there.
And, Harry, thank you.

33:27.160 --> 33:28.680
Uh, see you there.

34:05.000 --> 34:06.480
Lorraine Griggs?

34:13.080 --> 34:15.920
<i>Keep it short.</i>
<i>No one wants to hear your podcast.</i>

34:16.000 --> 34:18.680
-Hi, it's just me. I'll try again later.

34:34.400 --> 34:36.120
Come on! Come on!

35:12.360 --> 35:13.200
Yes?

35:15.280 --> 35:17.040
She wasn't, no. Not helpful at all.

35:17.120 --> 35:18.520
So thanks for nothing.

35:23.040 --> 35:24.320
Give me that name again.

35:25.040 --> 35:26.480
And they can be found where?

35:29.000 --> 35:31.720
Well, let's hope they're more forthcoming
than your dancer.

35:45.400 --> 35:47.680
<i> This is Harry Sutton.</i>
<i>Please leave a message.</i>

35:48.400 --> 35:51.920
Harry, come on. Where are you?
I can't talk to the police on my own.

35:52.440 --> 35:54.280
I need you here. Call me.

36:34.720 --> 36:35.720
Cassie.

36:43.160 --> 36:44.760
Okay, we're at that address.

36:44.840 --> 36:47.000
Describe this Mr. Harry Sutton.

36:49.080 --> 36:51.640
Mid-fifties, shabby, seedy.

36:52.160 --> 36:54.240
His office is in an old pet shop.
