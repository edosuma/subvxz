WEBVTT

00:03.295 --> 00:05.380
Your pen flipping is superb, by the way.

00:05.464 --> 00:07.758
-I've been doing it for years.
-Yeah.

00:07.841 --> 00:09.635
-Hey!
-Wow. Impressive.

00:09.718 --> 00:11.762
I was watching him do it, like,
"That's impressive."

00:13.096 --> 00:14.848
In the 2008 crisis,

00:14.932 --> 00:18.602
I remember government jumps in and
bail out the mortgage derivative company.

00:18.685 --> 00:19.937
And it's billions of dollars.

00:20.020 --> 00:23.482
And the mortgages
that had gone underwater,

00:23.565 --> 00:25.692
well, those people were all gonna
lose their houses.

00:26.527 --> 00:28.654
And the Secretary of the Treasury,
Tim Geithner,

00:28.737 --> 00:34.409
said we couldn't bail out the homeowners
in the way that we bailed out the banks.

00:35.077 --> 00:36.161
And I said, "Why not?"

00:36.245 --> 00:38.455
And he said, "Moral hazard."

00:39.081 --> 00:42.167
You would be rewarding those,

00:42.251 --> 00:46.046
through their own fault,
their mortgages went south.

00:47.130 --> 00:51.385
So you gave billions of dollars
to the people

00:51.468 --> 00:57.099
whose shitty bets nearly imploded
the world economy.

00:57.182 --> 00:59.351
How is that not "moral hazard"?

01:00.477 --> 01:03.063
And I'll never forget, he said…

01:04.147 --> 01:07.025
"We had to land the plane.
The plane was on fire"…

01:07.109 --> 01:09.027
-That's right.
-…"and we had to land it."

01:09.111 --> 01:12.281
In that moment, I was like,
"Oh, my God. And you're the Democrat."

01:15.325 --> 01:16.368
Oh, my God!

01:52.112 --> 01:53.572
Hey! Good evening.

01:54.740 --> 01:55.908
Good evening.

01:55.991 --> 01:59.244
That is tremendous stamina on your part.

01:59.328 --> 02:01.747
That had to be
a minute and a half of applause,

02:01.830 --> 02:04.333
like, "Can we just put our hands down?"

02:05.792 --> 02:07.085
Good evening and welcome.

02:07.586 --> 02:12.174
As you know, our country continues
to emerge from the recent pandemic.

02:12.257 --> 02:15.761
And then, of course, plunge back into it,
and then re-emerge, and then…

02:16.470 --> 02:17.763
It's emotionally a lot.

02:18.472 --> 02:24.561
During this time, we learned it was
the essential workers who kept us afloat.

02:24.645 --> 02:26.647
Wall Street didn't build this country.

02:26.730 --> 02:28.357
The middle class built the country.

02:28.440 --> 02:32.361
…the people who built this country
from the ground up. The workers.

02:32.444 --> 02:34.363
I love our blue-collar workers.

02:34.446 --> 02:37.616
I consider myself, in a certain way,
to be a blue collar worker.

02:37.699 --> 02:41.161
…taxi cab drivers and cops
and firefighters

02:41.245 --> 02:42.871
and waiters and waitresses

02:42.955 --> 02:45.040
and the men and women
with calluses on their hands…

02:45.123 --> 02:48.085
…working man
with calluses on his hands…

02:48.168 --> 02:50.128
…men and women
with calluses on their hands…

02:50.212 --> 02:52.422
…men and women with
calluses on their hands…

02:52.506 --> 02:54.049
…calluses on their hands…

02:54.132 --> 02:57.553
…whose hands are thick with calluses.

02:57.636 --> 03:01.807
It's the official truck
of callused hands and elbow grease.

03:01.890 --> 03:06.186
Praise the workers. Praise the work.

03:10.190 --> 03:11.942
Yes, by all means, praise the worker.

03:12.025 --> 03:15.070
But for God's sakes,
will no one give them hand lotion?

03:16.989 --> 03:19.449
Their mitts are like sandpaper.

03:19.533 --> 03:21.118
Give 'em some lotion.

03:23.203 --> 03:27.499
We love and respect
the hardworking people of this country,

03:27.583 --> 03:32.880
although I'm pretty sure
they don't always feel the love.

03:32.963 --> 03:34.965
First of all, my age.
I'm going to, you know--

03:35.048 --> 03:37.509
I need health care
for a surgery if it comes up.

03:37.593 --> 03:39.386
I need assistance to pay my rent.

03:39.469 --> 03:43.515
After twenty-five and a half years,
I make $8.99 an hour.

03:43.599 --> 03:47.352
The student loans will probably delay
me ever buying a house with my fiancé.

03:47.436 --> 03:50.355
I dropped out of college.
I had to. I couldn't afford it.

03:50.439 --> 03:51.607
My mother couldn't afford it.

03:51.690 --> 03:53.108
I don't get paid maternity leave.

03:53.192 --> 03:54.568
I work seven days a week.

03:54.651 --> 03:56.778
I can't afford to retire
because of health care.

03:56.862 --> 03:59.823
I need childcare
like I need my next breath.

03:59.907 --> 04:01.992
I have two degrees.

04:02.075 --> 04:04.786
I have student loans
and bachelor's degrees

04:04.870 --> 04:06.622
and 14 years' experience.

04:06.705 --> 04:08.540
I should not have to come ask for food.

04:08.624 --> 04:10.250
I'm living paycheck to paycheck.

04:10.334 --> 04:12.961
If I live in a country that says
it's number one,

04:13.545 --> 04:15.923
why do I feel like, you know,
I'm at the bottom of the barrel?

04:16.005 --> 04:19.426
It turns out that hardworking Americans
aren't doing that great.

04:20.552 --> 04:22.429
Anybody know what might help them?

04:22.513 --> 04:25.349
…single-payer health care,
government paid childcare…

04:25.432 --> 04:27.309
-…free college…
-…government healthy food…

04:27.392 --> 04:31.063
…early education, child education,
universal childcare…

04:31.146 --> 04:35.108
…guaranteed job for everyone,
with a family-sustaining wage,

04:35.192 --> 04:39.446
adequate family and medical leave,
paid vacations and retirement security.

04:40.155 --> 04:44.076
You guys are dead-on.
Man. That is totally unexpected.

04:44.159 --> 04:45.786
But you all are dead-on right.

04:45.869 --> 04:49.414
That is exactly what we need to do
in this country.

04:49.498 --> 04:51.375
But I sensed a tone in your voice.

04:51.458 --> 04:54.086
Why aren't we doing those things?

04:54.169 --> 04:56.755
If that's not socialism,
I'm not sure what is.

04:56.839 --> 04:58.966
…every socialist wish list item.

04:59.049 --> 05:01.260
…socialist and globalist wish list…

05:01.343 --> 05:02.469
…socialist fantasy…

05:02.553 --> 05:03.887
Paradise for all…

05:05.305 --> 05:06.306
Right!

05:09.685 --> 05:10.853
So there it is.

05:11.520 --> 05:16.483
We cannot give our hardworking,
leather-handed heroes

05:17.526 --> 05:20.821
their basic needs because that's…

05:23.574 --> 05:24.616
socialism.

05:30.789 --> 05:36.211
And thus… the problem with the economy.

05:36.879 --> 05:40.215
Now, if you've ever listened to AM radio
in your uncle's van,

05:41.216 --> 05:45.596
you know: Socialism not good.

05:45.679 --> 05:48.891
The moment America becomes
a socialist country

05:48.974 --> 05:52.978
is the moment that America ceases
to be America.

05:53.061 --> 05:55.147
The United Socialist States of America…

05:55.230 --> 05:59.735
…job-killing, soul-crushing,
socialist agenda.

05:59.818 --> 06:01.612
I mean, hello, Venezuela.

06:01.695 --> 06:04.489
They wanna take your pickup truck…

06:04.573 --> 06:05.741
They want your money,

06:05.824 --> 06:07.910
and if you won't give it to 'em,
they'll take it.

06:07.993 --> 06:09.786
…they wanna rebuild your home…

06:09.870 --> 06:12.164
Socialism destroys. Socialism kills.

06:12.247 --> 06:13.582
People really die.

06:13.665 --> 06:15.292
-It's despair…
-…destruction…

06:15.375 --> 06:16.835
-…it's starvation…
-…poverty…

06:16.919 --> 06:18.295
-…squalor…
-…chaos…

06:18.378 --> 06:19.922
Death.

06:20.005 --> 06:22.049
…they wanna take away your hamburgers…

06:28.347 --> 06:29.473
Death!

06:30.140 --> 06:31.308
Despair!

06:32.809 --> 06:34.061
The Hamburglar!

06:38.357 --> 06:40.442
And, you know,
they're being so descriptive,

06:40.526 --> 06:44.029
but I just wish I had
some kind of visual metaphor

06:44.112 --> 06:45.155
for what they mean.

06:51.078 --> 06:55.624
Takes a brave and adept hunter
to bring down a giant, stationary placard.

06:58.627 --> 07:01.129
So we know that socialism is evil.

07:02.005 --> 07:05.342
But if you would indulge me
for just a moment,

07:05.425 --> 07:07.636
why is it evil again?

07:07.719 --> 07:10.305
Is socialism a fair system?

07:10.389 --> 07:11.557
Oh, not at all.

07:11.640 --> 07:14.101
Because what does socialism do?

07:14.184 --> 07:19.273
It allows the government to choose
winners and losers.

07:19.356 --> 07:24.403
And that is one of the things that
we as conservatives fight against.

07:24.486 --> 07:26.780
We want a level playing field.

07:27.865 --> 07:32.035
First of all,
your blazer has magnificent buttons.

07:40.836 --> 07:43.088
I'm quite superficial, I hope you--

07:44.798 --> 07:46.592
So, socialism is bad

07:47.217 --> 07:52.055
because it's the government picking
the winners and losers.

07:52.890 --> 07:54.349
And there's nothing worse than that.

07:54.433 --> 07:58.228
Not spiders with wings,
not grandma titty punching.

07:58.312 --> 08:00.439
There's nothing worse.

08:02.524 --> 08:05.777
Basically saying,
"If you're a loser, it's your fault.

08:05.861 --> 08:08.363
And government stepping in is socialism.

08:08.447 --> 08:11.033
Get your shit together,

08:11.116 --> 08:16.330
and keep Uncle Sam's sweet teats
out of your dirty fucking loser mouth."

08:16.413 --> 08:19.708
Uncle Sam wants you
to leave these bad boys alone.

08:22.961 --> 08:25.797
There's only one--
There's only one problem with this.

08:27.132 --> 08:32.136
And that is, government picks
winners and losers all the time.

08:32.638 --> 08:36.683
The White House gives an early
Christmas present to Detroit's automakers,

08:36.767 --> 08:38.519
a $17 billion loan.

08:38.602 --> 08:42.272
The airline industry has gotten
a $50 billion lifeline.

08:42.356 --> 08:45.442
…$23 million incentive package for Amazon.

08:45.526 --> 08:48.445
JPMorgan Chase got $25 billion.

08:48.529 --> 08:50.239
Chrysler got some seven billion dollars.

08:50.322 --> 08:55.244
$700 billion of your taxpayer money
to Wall Street big banks.

08:55.327 --> 09:00.165
The tuna company StarKist plus gets
a $62 million tax credit.

09:00.249 --> 09:03.293
Wisconsin is giving Foxconn
three billion dollars.

09:03.377 --> 09:07.673
The state offered more than $845 million

09:07.756 --> 09:10.259
for Apple to build
right where I'm standing right now.

09:10.342 --> 09:12.344
I thought we cut that clip.

09:12.427 --> 09:15.055
I thought--
I thought the Apple clip got cut.

09:15.138 --> 09:16.139
I don't--

09:16.974 --> 09:19.059
That's not-- That's-- That's--

09:19.142 --> 09:21.562
And the last one was very fair.

09:26.149 --> 09:27.192
All of it is--

09:32.990 --> 09:34.116
I'll see myself out.

09:36.952 --> 09:42.332
So it turns out that the government is
picking winners and losers.

09:42.416 --> 09:45.169
It's just picking corporations
to be the winners.

09:46.044 --> 09:47.045
Man, I would imagine

09:47.129 --> 09:52.885
that good free-market capitalists hate
this type of socialist intervention.

09:53.427 --> 09:57.556
Let's be clear.
The auto bailout saved 1.5 million jobs.

09:57.639 --> 10:00.684
When we figure out who to triage,
we must save Boeing.

10:00.767 --> 10:03.061
Stabilizing the banks was essential.

10:03.145 --> 10:06.273
We incentivized Amazon to come,

10:06.356 --> 10:10.110
as we incentivize
every big business to come.

10:10.194 --> 10:14.364
Ten billion is a small price to pay
for saving a company of that magnitude.

10:26.627 --> 10:31.673
So apparently government picking winners
and losers in this case is great.

10:32.633 --> 10:34.760
Not only does the government pick
winners and losers,

10:34.843 --> 10:35.969
but with these bailouts,

10:36.053 --> 10:40.224
they're apparently picking losers
and turning them into winners.

10:41.517 --> 10:43.352
Just out of curiosity,

10:43.435 --> 10:46.772
what would you say
if we bailed out a person?

10:46.855 --> 10:52.069
Making being poor more comfortable
has only helped people to stay poor.

10:52.152 --> 10:53.862
They started sending checks to people,

10:53.946 --> 10:57.449
getting them a little bit more reliant
on government, more reliant on government.

10:57.533 --> 11:00.118
And now they're full-blown
incentivizing laziness.

11:00.202 --> 11:03.580
Because why work hard when
the government is gonna cut you a check?

11:03.664 --> 11:06.625
The welfare state has incentivized women
to marry the government

11:06.708 --> 11:09.378
and allowed men to abandon
their financial and moral responsibility.

11:09.461 --> 11:11.296
"Women are marrying governments!"

11:11.880 --> 11:14.508
Is that really any worse
than marrying men?

11:14.591 --> 11:15.592
Probably not.

11:17.052 --> 11:19.513
I mean, to be honest…

11:22.015 --> 11:24.101
are we that much of a bargain? No.

11:24.977 --> 11:27.771
And by the way, it is 2021…

11:27.855 --> 11:30.148
I believe it's time
men can also marry governments.

11:30.232 --> 11:31.441
I think that's something--

11:35.487 --> 11:37.573
That's a woke crowd, right there.

11:41.952 --> 11:48.125
The federal government intervenes
all the time in favor of corporations,

11:48.208 --> 11:50.127
be it through lowering
corporate tax rates,

11:50.210 --> 11:54.840
deregulating certain industries,
industry subsidies, bailouts…

11:54.923 --> 11:57.926
And I assume, since a lot of that comes
from the taxpayers,

11:58.010 --> 12:01.305
we at least get some say
in what they do with the money.

12:01.805 --> 12:05.475
I certainly don't want the government
trying to direct companies

12:05.559 --> 12:07.477
to put their capital in this place
or that place.

12:07.561 --> 12:10.314
The federal government should not be
in the business

12:10.397 --> 12:12.524
of specifying executive compensation.

12:12.608 --> 12:15.611
I really just don't think
it's the job of the government

12:15.694 --> 12:18.822
to decide
how companies should spend their money.

12:18.906 --> 12:21.825
Let companies decide
how they want to spend their money.

12:21.909 --> 12:24.995
Don't interfere with private businesses.
Let them make their decisions.

12:25.078 --> 12:27.206
Government should have zero role

12:27.289 --> 12:32.085
in determining, in influencing,
in mandating any type of CEO compensation.

12:32.169 --> 12:33.587
These are private companies.

12:33.670 --> 12:37.174
Yeah, it's interesting,
because when we bail out people,

12:37.257 --> 12:39.384
we got nothing but say.

12:39.468 --> 12:43.096
For instance, with food stamps,
they cannot buy diapers,

12:43.180 --> 12:47.476
cleaning supplies, vitamins or hot food.

12:47.559 --> 12:48.769
Hot food.

12:49.561 --> 12:51.271
Corporations can use bailout money

12:51.355 --> 12:53.732
to pay their already wealthy CEOs
if they feel like it.

12:53.815 --> 12:56.568
But God forbid
a poor person finds their way

12:56.652 --> 12:59.279
to a salad bar's heat-lamp pot roast.

12:59.363 --> 13:00.948
"No, no, no!

13:01.615 --> 13:07.162
Only the rich get to suckle the nectar
of premade meatball subs."

13:10.916 --> 13:14.086
"That is the domain of the aristocracy."

13:18.966 --> 13:21.051
When corporations fail, you pay for it.

13:21.760 --> 13:23.720
But when they succeed, it's theirs.

13:23.804 --> 13:26.890
They socialize their losses
and privatize their gains.

13:27.474 --> 13:29.017
Why do we allow that?

13:29.101 --> 13:30.352
Consider this:

13:30.435 --> 13:33.522
Wealthy people do not stash their billions

13:33.605 --> 13:36.483
in safe deposit boxes
loaded with $100 bills.

13:36.567 --> 13:39.361
They don't do that,
and they don't spend it all at the mall.

13:39.444 --> 13:41.154
They don't spend like crazy.

13:41.238 --> 13:43.574
No, wealthy people invest.

13:43.657 --> 13:46.535
It is investment that creates jobs
and economic growth.

13:47.286 --> 13:49.246
See, this is the lie they tell you,

13:49.329 --> 13:51.832
that all this money flowing
towards corporate, moneyed interests

13:51.915 --> 13:54.418
is actually for your benefit.

13:54.501 --> 13:57.880
That government intervention
for corporations is our free market,

13:58.672 --> 14:02.301
but government intervention for workers
is socialism.

14:02.968 --> 14:05.345
And that's the reason
for the socialism scaremongering.

14:05.429 --> 14:09.975
It's a false choice to make you believe
that this country has but two options:

14:10.559 --> 14:16.523
a socialist, authoritarian… hamburgerless,
Venezuelan nightmare,

14:17.774 --> 14:19.693
or accept the status quo,

14:19.776 --> 14:22.196
where large corporations benefit
from government help,

14:22.279 --> 14:25.157
then use some of those profits
to lobby the same government

14:25.240 --> 14:26.992
for more government help.

14:27.075 --> 14:29.119
They want you to believe
that in a free market,

14:29.203 --> 14:34.041
while your wages stay low, someday,
the largesse will eventually trickle down.

14:34.833 --> 14:35.918
And in the meantime,

14:36.001 --> 14:39.129
enjoy watching your tax dollars
help billionaires

14:39.213 --> 14:41.715
launch themselves into fucking space.

14:42.382 --> 14:43.383
We'll be right back.

14:52.017 --> 14:54.311
America needs inspiration.

14:55.938 --> 14:58.315
-Mr. Bezos.
-Mr. Bezos? A question.

14:58.398 --> 15:00.234
A vision for the future.

15:00.317 --> 15:03.278
A reminder of what one man can do.

15:07.699 --> 15:10.285
I'm going to ride a rocket into space.

15:11.620 --> 15:14.623
And it's going to look just like my dick.

15:16.333 --> 15:19.711
We've been there before.
Many times, okay? Men, women.

15:19.795 --> 15:24.258
Do you know, in 1961,
we sent a chimpanzee into space?

15:24.341 --> 15:27.052
But not in a dick that looks like my dick.

15:30.013 --> 15:33.684
Billionaire Elon Musk
joins the race into space.

15:36.436 --> 15:39.982
I too will be riding
my big, old dick into space.

15:47.197 --> 15:50.993
People see things the way they are
and ask, "Why?"

15:51.076 --> 15:53.453
I see things the way they could be,
and ask--

15:53.537 --> 15:57.165
I'm sorry, could we maybe get the curve

15:57.916 --> 16:00.586
to go midway up the shaft
of the space dick?

16:02.921 --> 16:04.631
Not enough! Not short enough.

16:05.257 --> 16:07.968
Not wide enough. Not enough!

16:09.094 --> 16:11.847
You know who else had a chode? Galileo.

16:14.474 --> 16:18.270
You know aerodynamics?
A rocket takes off into the sky.

16:24.985 --> 16:26.195
I am a hero.

16:26.278 --> 16:27.779
I am a conqueror.

16:27.863 --> 16:29.406
I am a god.

16:29.990 --> 16:34.286
You own a e-bookstore
and a whole grip of Whole Foods.

16:38.957 --> 16:41.210
One small step for mankind.

16:41.919 --> 16:45.088
One giant leap for me, personally.

16:59.811 --> 17:02.564
Oh, so good of you to join us, Bezos.

17:02.648 --> 17:03.899
Us?

17:06.568 --> 17:09.279
Zuckerberg, is that you?

17:10.196 --> 17:12.699
You don't have enough sunscreen
to be up here, Zuckerberg.

17:13.951 --> 17:16.369
Technically, I got here first.

17:24.169 --> 17:25.170
Chode.

17:58.620 --> 18:01.540
We have this commitment
to the American dream,

18:01.623 --> 18:03.458
or this "bootstraps" myth. You know?

18:03.542 --> 18:07.546
Like, "If you're American, you work hard,
and you need to earn your keep."

18:07.629 --> 18:10.549
But otherwise it's a handout
when everyone else gets a handout.

18:10.632 --> 18:12.217
You had a great stat. Something like:

18:12.301 --> 18:15.053
For every dollar that they put into…

18:15.137 --> 18:17.055
Yeah, it's that you don't
get a dollar back.

18:17.139 --> 18:20.434
When you give corporations money,
via subsidies, tax rate,

18:20.517 --> 18:23.103
you tend to not get your dollar back,
as a government.

18:23.187 --> 18:24.855
In fact, research shows

18:24.938 --> 18:27.524
that the best investment
the government makes is children.

18:27.608 --> 18:30.027
We should probably explain:
Susan knows everything.

18:30.110 --> 18:31.862
'Cause the audience hasn't seen…

18:32.821 --> 18:35.991
I was taught that if you worked hard…

18:37.284 --> 18:40.370
that you would be able
to live a decent life.

18:40.454 --> 18:42.206
That doesn't work anymore.

18:42.956 --> 18:46.835
You can break your back, sweating blood…

18:47.628 --> 18:51.757
the only people who are making up
from our hard work

18:51.840 --> 18:54.927
are our CEOs, our shareholders.

18:55.010 --> 18:59.431
We have been investing in making life
easier and more comfortable

18:59.515 --> 19:01.850
for corporations for a very long time.

19:01.934 --> 19:05.312
We're still really afraid of making, like,

19:05.395 --> 19:10.150
corporations, and people at the top
of the wealth bracket, unhappy.

19:10.234 --> 19:12.903
But we've just seen inequality growing.

19:12.986 --> 19:14.696
It's only grown more and more.

19:14.780 --> 19:16.073
Wages have stagnated.

19:16.156 --> 19:21.036
I have two jobs and a bachelor's degree
and I struggle to make ends meet.

19:21.870 --> 19:24.373
The federal poverty guidelines say
that I'm not poor,

19:24.456 --> 19:26.708
but I cashed in a jar full of change
the other night

19:26.792 --> 19:29.294
so my daughter could attend
a high school band competition

19:29.378 --> 19:30.671
with her band.

19:31.463 --> 19:33.924
I can't go grocery shopping
without a calculator.

19:34.550 --> 19:38.345
I had to decide which bills not to pay
to be here in this room today.

19:38.971 --> 19:42.266
Believe me, I pulled myself up
by the bootstraps so many damn times

19:42.349 --> 19:43.809
that I've ripped 'em off.

19:48.313 --> 19:51.525
So now let's talk a little bit about…

19:51.608 --> 19:52.901
Let's talk a little bit about

19:52.985 --> 19:57.823
why the workers we profess to love so much
are getting left behind.

19:57.906 --> 19:59.741
First, we have Magaly Licolli,

19:59.825 --> 20:02.828
cofounder of Venceremos,
a nonprofit community center

20:02.911 --> 20:06.206
that organizes poultry plant workers
in Arkansas.

20:06.290 --> 20:07.958
We've got Amy Jo Hutchison.

20:08.041 --> 20:10.669
She's an organizer and advocate
for low-wage and impoverished workers

20:10.752 --> 20:11.795
in West Virginia.

20:11.879 --> 20:14.798
Darrick Hamilton is
a professor of economics and urban policy

20:14.882 --> 20:16.341
at the New School in New York.

20:16.425 --> 20:20.304
Douglas Holtz-Eakin is the former director
of Congressional Budget Office

20:20.387 --> 20:23.724
and current president
of the think tank American Action Forum.

20:23.807 --> 20:27.060
Amy Jo, I want to start with you,
because the testimony was so powerful.

20:27.144 --> 20:29.271
Tell me a little bit
about why you were called that day,

20:29.354 --> 20:31.148
and what you were testifying about.

20:32.232 --> 20:35.694
I was called to do that
because I'd been to Congress before

20:35.777 --> 20:37.196
to speak at a press briefing

20:37.279 --> 20:40.949
when they weren't sure whether they were
gonna reauthorize CHIP insurance for kids.

20:41.033 --> 20:42.910
I'm the only parent of two children.

20:42.993 --> 20:45.120
Both of my kids were insured on CHIP.

20:45.204 --> 20:46.914
They wanted someone from West Virginia.

20:46.997 --> 20:49.208
We have one of the highest poverty rates
in the nation,

20:49.291 --> 20:50.792
especially with child poverty.

20:50.876 --> 20:52.628
I thought it was incredibly powerful

20:52.711 --> 20:55.380
because it was exactly
what they say it isn't,

20:55.464 --> 20:57.841
which is, "People are lazy.
They're not working hard."

20:57.925 --> 21:00.469
And your story is:
You're working your ass off.

21:00.552 --> 21:01.637
Absolutely.

21:01.720 --> 21:04.765
And, Magaly,
you represent poultry workers,

21:04.848 --> 21:09.186
which is probably
one of the most difficult jobs to do,

21:09.269 --> 21:11.396
just purely on a physical basis.

21:11.480 --> 21:13.482
But also communities that are--

21:13.565 --> 21:16.944
oftentimes don't have any voice
in the system.

21:17.027 --> 21:21.698
Yeah. I began organizing poultry workers
since 2014.

21:21.782 --> 21:26.119
The majority of the community
are really disabled because of these jobs.

21:26.620 --> 21:29.206
Ergonomic issues, carpal tunnel syndrome.

21:29.289 --> 21:31.625
Most of them have respiratory problems.

21:31.708 --> 21:36.839
So whenever the pandemic hit,
it was a red flag for all of the workers.

21:36.922 --> 21:38.924
And we were like,
"What is going to happen?"

21:39.007 --> 21:41.593
Because these workers
don't even have paid sick leave.

21:41.677 --> 21:45.806
I want to try
and figure out some specifics

21:45.889 --> 21:50.310
on what we think can change
the dynamic for workers.

21:50.394 --> 21:53.564
Where can we do it from top down
rather than bottom up?

21:54.189 --> 21:58.277
Well, I think the one thing to start with
is way before they become workers

21:58.360 --> 22:01.321
and way before we're worried
about the corporations.

22:01.405 --> 22:05.200
We have a failing K-12 education system
in the United States.

22:05.284 --> 22:09.371
Those young people will never have
a fighting chance

22:09.454 --> 22:10.455
if we don't take care of 'em.

22:10.539 --> 22:13.166
And I think that's the biggest problem
this country faces.

22:13.250 --> 22:14.668
It's been that way for ten years.

22:14.751 --> 22:16.170
We measure it. We don't fix it.

22:16.253 --> 22:18.172
-But isn't that--
-So that's the start.

22:18.255 --> 22:23.177
Isn't that also still a function of--
Education is also a function of poverty.

22:23.260 --> 22:27.806
-And if you're asking teachers to fix…
-More than just teach.

22:27.890 --> 22:30.350
-…inherent, systemic economic disparities…
-Yes. I agree.

22:30.434 --> 22:32.352
…I think you're putting
too much on people.

22:32.436 --> 22:35.272
-I'm not blaming the teachers.
-Right. I'm just saying--

22:35.355 --> 22:36.899
I'm saying--

22:36.982 --> 22:40.319
If you start out that far behind
when you've come into your first job…

22:40.402 --> 22:41.737
-Good grief.
-But a lot--

22:41.820 --> 22:43.822
It makes everything we're gonna suggest
much harder.

22:43.906 --> 22:45.574
Education is not a panacea.

22:45.657 --> 22:48.076
Education has become a political ruse.

22:48.160 --> 22:51.872
Education shifts responsibility
from public onto individuals.

22:51.955 --> 22:55.542
"If only you work hard and study hard,
you will be fine."

22:55.626 --> 22:58.545
If you're Black and your head
of household has a college degree,

22:58.629 --> 23:02.341
you have less wealth than a white family
where the head dropped out of high school.

23:02.424 --> 23:04.885
So that obviously is
established historically.

23:04.968 --> 23:06.512
I mean, we got the causality wrong.

23:06.595 --> 23:11.391
Perhaps it is wealth itself
that generates capacity to get a degree

23:11.475 --> 23:13.644
or a certain amount of education.

23:13.727 --> 23:15.062
At the end of the day,

23:15.145 --> 23:20.526
we need an economy that empowers people
with resources well beyond education.

23:20.609 --> 23:23.278
Including education,
but many other factors,

23:23.362 --> 23:25.197
like good health, like a job.

23:25.280 --> 23:27.824
Literally having a job. Right to a job.

23:27.908 --> 23:29.409
I have a bachelor's degree.

23:31.578 --> 23:33.830
I'm still impoverished, you know.

23:33.914 --> 23:36.750
There are people with bachelor's degrees
making $15 an hour.

23:36.834 --> 23:41.421
-Right.
-I was a gifted kid in high school, right?

23:41.505 --> 23:43.048
The world was my oyster.

23:43.131 --> 23:46.009
But I'm still living in poverty,
with a bachelor's degree, in this country.

23:46.093 --> 23:48.262
-A lot of the money for education…
-Shouldn't be that way.

23:48.345 --> 23:53.016
…actually is lost in the tax subsidies
that we give to corporations.

23:53.100 --> 23:56.812
So they're inexplicably
and inextricably linked.

23:56.895 --> 23:59.773
Okay, so let's-- Education is one thing.

23:59.857 --> 24:02.442
Amy Jo, what would you say you need?

24:02.526 --> 24:04.278
A care infrastructure.

24:04.361 --> 24:06.029
You want to talk about early education,

24:06.113 --> 24:08.448
we need to include
early childhood education as well.

24:08.532 --> 24:12.202
You cannot have workforce participation
if you do not have childcare.

24:12.286 --> 24:15.747
You will never-- Childcare in the state
of West Virginia, for one child,

24:15.831 --> 24:18.292
for a private-pay family,
costs more for one year

24:18.375 --> 24:21.128
than a year at West Virginia University
or Marshall University,

24:21.211 --> 24:23.672
which is our state's two largest schools.

24:23.755 --> 24:27.426
So parents are paying more for childcare
than they are for college tuition.

24:27.509 --> 24:29.887
So what's gonna incentivize me
to go to work?

24:29.970 --> 24:33.015
Childcare has been a middle-class issue

24:33.098 --> 24:35.642
for two decades now
on the left and the right.

24:35.726 --> 24:38.896
If you go to solidly Republican
congressional districts,

24:38.979 --> 24:43.525
you will find that the leading issue for
a lot of women is health and childcare.

24:43.609 --> 24:44.776
That's it. It's really simple.

24:44.860 --> 24:47.112
I don't even think this should be
a political issue, though.

24:47.196 --> 24:50.365
Like, start paying attention to the--
Maslow's hierarchy of needs, right?

24:50.449 --> 24:52.451
I have a social work background--

24:52.534 --> 24:54.786
Oh, shit. Maslow's hierarchy--

24:59.416 --> 25:01.251
See, now I'm getting a little upset.

25:01.335 --> 25:04.296
-You do have a bachelor's degree.
-See, I do.

25:04.379 --> 25:08.342
-Oh, killing it, Amy Jo.
-I wanted to be a social worker.

25:08.425 --> 25:11.428
But I mean, you know,
it's not rocket science to me.

25:11.512 --> 25:14.097
Just think about the basic needs
of human beings.

25:14.181 --> 25:19.311
There was a period in American history
where we had improvements.

25:19.394 --> 25:21.980
We had productivity growing at 100%

25:22.064 --> 25:26.777
over a period from 1948 to about 1979,

25:26.860 --> 25:29.947
and labor real wages growing in lockstep.

25:30.030 --> 25:32.824
Then as a result
of the Civil Rights Movement,

25:32.908 --> 25:34.952
there was a corporate
backlash to that gain.

25:35.035 --> 25:39.081
And it formed into
what we now see as supply-side economics.

25:39.164 --> 25:43.544
This idea that if only we invest
in the dynamism of corporations,

25:43.627 --> 25:45.921
that that's somehow gonna lift all boats,

25:46.004 --> 25:48.048
that somehow workers
are gonna improve as well.

25:48.131 --> 25:50.509
-It obviously hasn't been realized.
-Right.

25:50.592 --> 25:54.847
Amy Jo, you know, West Virginia has
kind of a vaunted labor history.

25:54.930 --> 25:57.140
You know, mine workers
and people like that.

25:57.224 --> 25:58.475
Where is it now?

25:58.559 --> 26:00.602
Like, in terms of
the people that you represent?

26:00.686 --> 26:02.896
Now we're a right-to-work state.

26:02.980 --> 26:06.108
And what the state legislature's trying
to pass, we can't even organize now.

26:06.191 --> 26:07.943
They don't even want us to organize,
you know.

26:08.026 --> 26:11.113
But I think, you know,
one of the biggest obstacles from my--

26:11.196 --> 26:12.406
This is my lived experience.

26:12.489 --> 26:14.658
Don't wanna speak for the millions
of poor people out there.

26:14.741 --> 26:16.827
But one of the obstacles is, like,

26:16.910 --> 26:20.706
you know, you're choosing between
organizing and pissing off your boss.

26:21.290 --> 26:23.041
And if you're in that gray space

26:23.125 --> 26:27.296
between not qualifying for SNAP
and not making enough to get by,

26:27.379 --> 26:30.340
like, the real decision
at the end of the day will come to,

26:30.424 --> 26:33.218
"Amy Jo, are you gonna join this union
and piss off your boss,

26:33.302 --> 26:35.512
or are you going to feed
your kids in the morning?"

26:35.596 --> 26:39.349
You know, and so
that's how drastic this stuff is.

26:39.433 --> 26:42.311
I organize poultry workers
in the home of Tyson Foods.

26:42.394 --> 26:45.564
And so Tyson has so much influence
over the community

26:45.647 --> 26:48.150
that workers could not even
travel with me.

26:48.233 --> 26:51.361
Or they cannot even do, like,
TV interviews

26:51.445 --> 26:54.781
because they're afraid
that they're gonna be losing their jobs--

26:54.865 --> 26:58.243
-The workers won't come on camera?
-On TV? No.

26:58.327 --> 27:01.788
Tyson has so much power
in these rural white communities.

27:01.872 --> 27:04.750
Like, last year with the pandemic,

27:04.833 --> 27:09.129
we saw the huge power
of the meat companies over the government.

27:09.213 --> 27:12.049
I mean, the processing plants were
the hot spot of COVID-19.

27:12.132 --> 27:18.347
And they paid so much millions to lobby
for the companies to not shut down.

27:18.430 --> 27:21.767
What power is strong enough

27:21.850 --> 27:26.563
to countervail
corporate power in this country?

27:26.647 --> 27:28.857
To me, the answer is obvious:
public power.

27:28.941 --> 27:32.361
At the end of the day,
government works on behalf of people,

27:32.444 --> 27:34.530
and that is who they should be
responsible for.

27:34.613 --> 27:36.698
And we shouldn't give Treasury a pass.

27:36.782 --> 27:38.283
We saw through this pandemic

27:38.367 --> 27:41.203
that Treasury could do more
than just revenue collect.

27:41.286 --> 27:44.039
They could send resources
directly to the American people.

27:44.122 --> 27:47.918
Treasury and the tax code is
America's biggest fiscal tool.

27:48.001 --> 27:49.503
And right now it is out of whack

27:49.586 --> 27:52.631
with the values of government
working on behalf of people

27:52.714 --> 27:54.550
as opposed to the corporations.

27:54.633 --> 27:57.719
I really appreciate you guys coming here
and having the conversation.

27:57.803 --> 28:00.305
I'm pretty sure we fixed it?

28:04.101 --> 28:05.727
Thank you so much. We'll be right back

28:07.437 --> 28:08.814
Guys, we did it!

28:11.650 --> 28:13.110
Hi. I'm LeVar Burton.

28:13.193 --> 28:15.070
You know me from…

28:15.153 --> 28:16.154
You know me.

28:16.780 --> 28:19.324
I've already taught one MasterClass,
but wouldn't you know it?

28:19.408 --> 28:21.118
I've got more to say.

28:21.201 --> 28:24.329
So in this new series,
I'm going to teach you

28:24.413 --> 28:27.499
why this country won't raise
the minimum wage.

28:28.083 --> 28:31.086
Where's that book
for the little Internet course I'm doing?

28:31.712 --> 28:32.713
Here it is.

28:37.968 --> 28:40.429
"This all started with slave labor."

28:40.512 --> 28:42.931
But Kunta don't need to read that shit.

28:43.015 --> 28:45.058
America won't raise the minimum wage

28:45.142 --> 28:47.394
because they're used to getting
the work for free.

28:47.477 --> 28:49.980
That's why we need a higher minimum wage,

28:50.063 --> 28:53.066
because if they could get away with it,
they'd pay you nothing.

28:53.650 --> 28:56.028
It's not slavery. It's perpetual poverty.

28:57.362 --> 28:59.072
Join me for my next series,

28:59.156 --> 29:01.825
where I teach you
about American beauty standards

29:01.909 --> 29:04.995
using the exact same book.

29:05.078 --> 29:08.415
But you don't have to take my word for it.

29:09.249 --> 29:10.501
I'll see you next time.

29:18.717 --> 29:21.595
I think, in 2008,
"We can't let the auto industry fail."

29:21.678 --> 29:24.556
"We can't let big banks fail,
the insurance industry fail."

29:24.640 --> 29:28.477
I think there's still
a lot of support for the idea

29:28.560 --> 29:30.896
that corporations are too big to fail.

29:30.979 --> 29:33.774
Or not even too big to fail,
that we can't let them fail.

29:33.857 --> 29:36.818
Because they are the backbone
of our economy, right?

29:36.902 --> 29:38.820
Don't you think
that's still a false choice?

29:38.904 --> 29:41.073
It's not about making them fail.

29:41.156 --> 29:43.784
It's about not allowing them
to privatize profit

29:43.867 --> 29:45.285
-and socialize losses.
-Exactly.

29:45.369 --> 29:50.290
You came around to the idea
that government is responsible for this.

29:50.374 --> 29:53.836
And government isn't doing its job
to rein in these corporations.

29:53.919 --> 29:56.505
Yeah. Regulation isn't the answer.

29:56.588 --> 29:58.799
Because they're outgunned.

29:58.882 --> 30:01.635
I don't wanna do a riff
from Hamilton right now.

30:01.718 --> 30:03.929
Outgunned, outmanned

30:04.012 --> 30:06.181
Out-planned, out stand

30:06.265 --> 30:09.476
-Stop rolling. Cut.
-Out-fanned, outmanned

30:09.560 --> 30:11.228
-Out-sand
-Yeah. Oh, boy.

30:11.311 --> 30:14.314
-You'll never stop trying to get into it.
-This show just got canceled.

30:14.398 --> 30:16.024
Room where it happens

30:16.108 --> 30:18.735
-Everybody! Room where it happens
-No.

30:18.819 --> 30:20.279
I'm a Jellicle cat

30:21.572 --> 30:23.490
I'm a Jellicle cat

30:25.492 --> 30:27.870
Thank you for taking time to talk to us.

30:27.953 --> 30:29.621
-Thank you--
-We really appreciate it.

30:29.705 --> 30:33.917
You know, they say
that free-market capitalism

30:34.001 --> 30:36.670
is the best way

30:36.753 --> 30:41.133
to deliver prosperity and growth

30:41.216 --> 30:47.389
and the most efficient way to distribute
that prosperity throughout a population.

30:47.472 --> 30:48.849
So, I guess my question is:

30:48.932 --> 30:53.520
When can we have a free-market
capitalist system in this country?

30:53.604 --> 30:55.856
-Well, we do have a capitalist system…
-What?

30:55.939 --> 30:58.025
-…in this country.
-But not free market?

30:58.108 --> 31:01.069
-The government plays an important role.
-Right.

31:01.153 --> 31:06.241
And it's really essential
that government play its role

31:06.325 --> 31:12.080
in order to make a market economy
efficient, well-functioning and fair.

31:12.164 --> 31:14.499
In our economy,
when government intervenes,

31:14.583 --> 31:18.045
government intervenes
on behalf of corporate interests

31:18.128 --> 31:23.217
in a much more robust way
than they do for labor interests.

31:24.343 --> 31:29.348
I think in recent decades
it is pretty much a fair assessment

31:29.431 --> 31:35.938
that many of the interventions
have enhanced the power of corporations,

31:36.021 --> 31:41.985
and we've ignored the needs
of individuals.

31:42.069 --> 31:46.782
And I think there are structural forces
in US economy

31:46.865 --> 31:50.702
and a failure of policy to do the job

31:50.786 --> 31:53.121
-that Americans, I think…
-Right.

31:53.205 --> 31:56.041
…should want government policy to do.

31:56.124 --> 31:58.669
The Fed--
and you were the chairman of the Fed--

31:58.752 --> 32:02.673
they're charged with making sure
that inflation doesn't get out of control,

32:02.756 --> 32:05.425
and that there's a certain stability
in the employment market.

32:05.509 --> 32:09.805
Employment and price stability
is the Fed's dual mandate.

32:09.888 --> 32:14.101
The Fed will step in
when corporate policy fails.

32:14.184 --> 32:16.812
They'll backstop large corporations.

32:16.895 --> 32:19.273
Couldn't they also do that for workers?

32:19.982 --> 32:21.233
Well, look,

32:21.316 --> 32:27.322
corporations only have access to the Fed
in very rare circumstances.

32:27.406 --> 32:30.284
And that is when we're faced with
a financial crisis,

32:30.367 --> 32:32.953
as we were in 2008,

32:33.036 --> 32:36.164
and then again when the pandemic struck.

32:37.165 --> 32:43.839
The Fed has a responsibility to make sure
that our financial system functions.

32:43.922 --> 32:46.258
-It's not right to say…
-But do you see, then-- Right.

32:46.341 --> 32:51.096
…that the Fed is lending to corporations
on a regular basis.

32:51.180 --> 32:53.223
-But…
-Maybe that's the disconnect though.

32:53.307 --> 32:57.603
Because I think the 2008 crisis
is a great example, you know.

32:58.187 --> 33:01.440
Instead of a big fire hose of money

33:01.523 --> 33:05.194
being turned on those mortgages
that went underwater

33:05.277 --> 33:07.321
and brought them back to sea level,

33:08.238 --> 33:12.242
they chose to pour money
into those bundles,

33:12.326 --> 33:14.411
and a lot of people lost their houses.

33:14.494 --> 33:19.833
People had every reason
to feel unhappy about what happened.

33:19.917 --> 33:22.002
The purpose of intervening

33:22.085 --> 33:28.300
so that big financial institutions
and markets didn't completely fail

33:28.383 --> 33:32.804
was to avoid a drying up
of credit in the economy.

33:32.888 --> 33:38.018
If those financial institutions had been
allowed to fail,

33:38.101 --> 33:44.608
the toll on ordinary families
would have been not only bad,

33:44.691 --> 33:45.901
which it was,

33:45.984 --> 33:48.529
but unspeakably horrendous.

33:48.612 --> 33:52.282
We would've been looking at
something like the Great Depression.

33:52.366 --> 33:56.745
I think, for people,
they would view it as,

33:56.828 --> 34:00.999
"Well, if I'm gonna lose my house,
that's a crisis." You know?

34:01.083 --> 34:03.377
"And I don't have a backstop."

34:03.961 --> 34:08.590
That's an important reason why,
when the pandemic struck,

34:08.674 --> 34:14.929
President Biden and his administration
have been focused

34:15.013 --> 34:18.016
on using fiscal policy, not the Fed

34:18.100 --> 34:22.603
to get help
to all those who really need it.

34:22.688 --> 34:26.149
But corporate America gets
all the benefits

34:26.233 --> 34:29.069
of American stability and fiscal policy

34:29.152 --> 34:31.237
but bears none of the responsibility.

34:31.321 --> 34:32.989
I'll give you an example.

34:33.072 --> 34:36.368
Walmart. They make billions in profits.

34:36.451 --> 34:41.331
Their workers are one of
the largest corporate users

34:41.415 --> 34:43.458
of social service programs.

34:43.542 --> 34:46.587
Why don't Walmart workers share
in the profits of Walmart?

34:47.295 --> 34:50.174
You know, in a capitalist system,

34:50.257 --> 34:55.804
companies have a right to distribute
profits to their shareholders.

34:55.888 --> 34:58.182
They're not forced to.

34:58.265 --> 35:02.102
-There's nothing in the law forces them--
-But aren't we subsidizing--

35:02.186 --> 35:03.854
This is the insidious part, I think, of--

35:03.937 --> 35:06.982
When we talk about
that we have a free-market system.

35:07.065 --> 35:09.193
Because what it makes it seem like

35:09.276 --> 35:15.157
is that the natural order of things
is that Walmart makes billions in profits

35:15.240 --> 35:17.659
and can distribute it to its shareholders,

35:17.743 --> 35:18.994
and that's just how it goes.

35:19.077 --> 35:21.830
But we know that we, the taxpayers,

35:21.914 --> 35:26.293
are subsidizing their workforce
with food stamps.

35:26.376 --> 35:30.172
They're getting the benefit
of our tax dollars.

35:30.255 --> 35:32.257
So it's not free market.

35:32.341 --> 35:37.471
The government, in many cases,
should be running programs.

35:37.554 --> 35:42.601
It's not necessarily the case
that Walmart should do that directly.

35:42.684 --> 35:47.856
You don't feel they are responsible
because they benefit from fiscal policy--

35:47.940 --> 35:49.983
they benefit
from the American infrastructure.

35:50.067 --> 35:52.486
They do benefit from fiscal policy.

35:52.569 --> 35:58.075
But I think the way-- an important way
of making them pay is by taxing them

35:58.158 --> 36:03.247
and making sure that
their profits provide the resources

36:03.330 --> 36:05.874
to provide that infrastructure.

36:05.958 --> 36:10.254
You would rather they still make
their billions in profit,

36:10.337 --> 36:12.256
but as long as they pay us taxes

36:12.339 --> 36:17.052
so that we have enough to give
their workers food stamps, that's okay?

36:17.135 --> 36:19.513
We also need to invest in their workers

36:19.596 --> 36:25.727
so that they can have jobs
that will produce better pay,

36:25.811 --> 36:28.438
that they'll have the skills
to be able to compete.

36:28.522 --> 36:33.151
But it feels like
the system doesn't have accountability

36:33.235 --> 36:34.820
for those at the corporate level.

36:34.903 --> 36:37.197
-How do we build that into the system?
-Well, I--

36:37.281 --> 36:39.324
I think there's a lot of truth
in what you're saying.

36:39.408 --> 36:43.620
And we're very focused
on trying to make sure

36:43.704 --> 36:47.040
that companies are responsible

36:47.124 --> 36:49.543
and do pay their fair share.

36:49.626 --> 36:51.461
So corporate--

36:51.545 --> 36:53.922
But we slashed the IRS budget.
We have all--

36:54.006 --> 36:56.300
We make accountability very difficult.

36:56.383 --> 36:57.843
We're trying to reverse that.

36:57.926 --> 37:04.558
We're proposing a substantial increase
in resources for the IRS

37:04.641 --> 37:07.186
so they can go after tax evasion.

37:07.269 --> 37:08.896
I want to tell you about another thing…

37:08.979 --> 37:10.314
-Yeah.
-…that's important here.

37:10.397 --> 37:14.818
All over the world, countries have been
competing with one another

37:14.902 --> 37:18.614
to attract these companies
by cutting corporate tax rates.

37:18.697 --> 37:21.283
-Right.
-Every country faces this,

37:21.366 --> 37:24.870
of companies having power
and saying to governments,

37:24.953 --> 37:27.956
"Cut our tax rates,
or we're gonna go someplace else."

37:28.040 --> 37:32.169
Is the problem here that corporations feel
like they have this country over a barrel?

37:32.252 --> 37:36.298
We have a system where
political contributions are important

37:36.381 --> 37:41.220
and where wealthy corporations
and individuals

37:41.303 --> 37:44.640
use the power of…

37:44.723 --> 37:49.394
-Access.
-…of access to skew the playing field.

37:49.478 --> 37:53.774
But the Biden administration has
a different view.

37:53.857 --> 38:00.280
And we wanna make sure
that companies behave fairly,

38:00.364 --> 38:02.491
that they pay their fair share.

38:02.574 --> 38:05.869
And we make the investments
in people and communities

38:05.953 --> 38:08.205
-that are necessary to reverse this.
-Who fights you on this?

38:08.288 --> 38:09.998
When you bring this up,

38:10.082 --> 38:12.626
or when you try and change fiscal policy
in that way,

38:13.794 --> 38:15.003
where's the fight from?

38:15.087 --> 38:16.421
What are the headwinds?

38:16.505 --> 38:18.465
Why is it difficult to push through?

38:19.633 --> 38:21.635
-The headwinds come--
-And I'd like some names.

38:21.718 --> 38:22.719
Let me get a pen.

38:22.803 --> 38:24.888
You know, the--

38:24.972 --> 38:27.266
People don't like
to have their taxes increased.

38:27.349 --> 38:32.604
And, you know,
we need to raise more tax revenue

38:32.688 --> 38:37.317
in order to finance the investments
that our economy needs

38:37.401 --> 38:39.778
to be productive
and for families to do well.

38:39.862 --> 38:45.993
Isn't entrenched poverty in this country
an urgent enough situation…

38:46.076 --> 38:49.413
-It is.
-…that if the Fed will intervene

38:49.496 --> 38:51.915
on behalf of a cataclysm,

38:51.999 --> 38:57.921
shouldn't perpetual poverty be
another urgent example

38:58.005 --> 39:01.758
of a catastrophe
that needs to be ameliorated?

39:01.842 --> 39:04.469
We need to raise the minimum wage.

39:04.553 --> 39:06.889
Congress has refused to act on it.

39:06.972 --> 39:12.186
That's something that Congress needs to do
to protect workers.

39:12.269 --> 39:13.896
There's a lot that needs to be--

39:13.979 --> 39:18.483
President Biden has set out
a Build Back Better Agenda.

39:19.193 --> 39:21.445
-I don't like slogans.
-And it has--

39:21.528 --> 39:24.072
Well, I think Build Back Better is
a good slogan. And--

39:24.156 --> 39:27.367
It's alliteration. I'll give you
alliteration. But I'm not crazy about it.

39:27.451 --> 39:31.622
I like it because it says
that there's something wrong

39:31.705 --> 39:35.751
with the way our economy has been working
that we need to change.

39:35.834 --> 39:41.298
What we have is a society that's grown
increasingly unequal,

39:41.381 --> 39:43.675
with huge inequality.

39:43.759 --> 39:50.474
And it perpetuates itself over time
in ways that are really insidious.

39:50.557 --> 39:53.268
You know, there's a lot we can do.

39:53.352 --> 39:56.438
And we have an agenda. We know what to do.

39:57.689 --> 39:59.858
Secretary, thank you so much.

39:59.942 --> 40:02.819
-Thank you. Much appreciated.
-Much appreciated. Thank you so much.

40:03.695 --> 40:06.823
I had this whole thing worked up
in my mind about the stock market,

40:06.907 --> 40:10.035
and how the Fed has been
artificially inflating stock prices,

40:10.118 --> 40:13.121
and, "Doesn't that point to another
intervention on behalf of corporations?"

40:13.205 --> 40:16.625
The way I'd gamed it out,
the conversation would've ended with,

40:16.708 --> 40:18.669
"Sir, I yield."

40:19.628 --> 40:22.756
"I yield to thee. You have vanquished"--

40:22.840 --> 40:24.633
And then she would fall over…

40:26.260 --> 40:27.970
and turn into a handkerchief.

40:29.555 --> 40:32.724
The stock market is really owned by a very
small group of people

40:32.808 --> 40:33.809
at the end of the day.

40:33.892 --> 40:37.896
The top 10% wealthiest families
own 84% of overall equities.

40:37.980 --> 40:40.649
-84% of the stock market.
-Right.

40:40.732 --> 40:46.363
It's been drilled into all of us now
that the stock market is the economy.

40:46.446 --> 40:48.824
And even for me,
as a dude who owns zero stocks,

40:48.907 --> 40:51.159
every time I see the stock market's up,
I'm like, "Thank God."

40:51.243 --> 40:52.494
Yeah. "We're okay."

40:52.578 --> 40:55.163
"We're all doing good today.
Today's a good day."

40:55.247 --> 40:59.126
Solution is, we lose the stock ticker,
and we create a ticker of just people.

40:59.710 --> 41:03.714
We follow the fortunes of workers
on the ticker on CNBC.

41:03.797 --> 41:05.090
Just-- Boom!

41:05.174 --> 41:08.510
And then, on the-- Listen,
not all the ideas are gonna be gems.

41:12.598 --> 41:13.849
Hello again!

41:16.560 --> 41:18.437
Please support the efforts
of tonight's guests.

41:18.520 --> 41:20.939
We will be following their work
on the show's podcast.

41:21.023 --> 41:22.900
We have a podcast,

41:22.983 --> 41:26.069
which I have to say is just neck and neck
with music in my eyes.

41:26.153 --> 41:27.154
Just-- Really.

41:27.237 --> 41:30.741
Podcast, music. What do I listen to today?

41:32.034 --> 41:35.829
By the way, if you're wondering
what a CNBC screen would look like

41:35.913 --> 41:40.083
if it actually reflected
the important metrics of the economy…

41:40.167 --> 41:41.668
Ta-da.

41:41.752 --> 41:44.630
There we go. Purchasing power,

41:44.713 --> 41:47.382
median wage, investing in work--

41:47.466 --> 41:51.470
Hey, look at that.
Vanessa is up 1.4 points.

41:53.347 --> 41:55.557
She just got a vendor's license
for a food truck.

41:55.641 --> 41:58.519
It's plant-based CBD barbecue fusion.

42:00.646 --> 42:02.814
It's a little bit of a risk.
But we'll see.

42:03.982 --> 42:06.568
That's all for tonight.
Please join us next time. Thank you.

42:08.487 --> 42:09.488
That's it!
