00:05.839 --> 00:08.008
<i>Previously on</i> Fire Country...

00:08.109 --> 00:10.678
Your kidney disease
has progressed to stage five.

00:10.778 --> 00:12.646
<i>We need to start you
on dialysis.</i>

00:12.746 --> 00:15.216
This can't be our little
secret anymore.

00:15.316 --> 00:16.584
You have to tell Bode.

00:16.684 --> 00:18.252
Uncle Luke?
What's this? You all good?

00:18.352 --> 00:21.355
Oh, yeah. I just had
a physical today.

00:21.455 --> 00:22.823
You said he got into some kind
of trouble early on?

00:22.923 --> 00:25.959
You were gonna send him away,
but then Sharon came by?

00:26.060 --> 00:27.761
You really want
her job, don't you?

00:27.861 --> 00:29.297
It's got nothing
to do with that.
<i>I told you,</i>

00:29.397 --> 00:30.664
<i>I don't want you doing this.</i>

00:30.764 --> 00:32.666
And I heard you.
It's just not up for debate.

00:32.766 --> 00:34.368
<i>Really, Manny?
On her first day?</i>

00:34.468 --> 00:37.171
She was out of line, and you're
about to be. I outrank you.

00:37.271 --> 00:40.074
What if you stopped caring
about what your dad thinks?

00:40.174 --> 00:42.510
Sounds like you need
to take that advice, too.

00:42.610 --> 00:44.412
Hey! Hey!

00:44.512 --> 00:46.614
Why is Bode calling you?

00:46.714 --> 00:48.682
People can change, Jake.
No, not Bode.

00:48.782 --> 00:51.051
What if I, uh,
called you again?

00:51.152 --> 00:52.553
I'd answer.

01:08.769 --> 01:11.672
♪ Snake kept slithering
your serpent smile ♪

01:11.772 --> 01:13.374
♪ Oh, you got something
to hide... ♪

01:13.474 --> 01:15.209
You have a call from...

01:15.309 --> 01:17.545
Bode Donovan.
...an inmate

01:17.645 --> 01:19.580
at the California Department
of Corrections.

01:19.680 --> 01:21.115
To accept, press 1.

01:22.550 --> 01:23.451
What do you want?

01:23.551 --> 01:24.952
I just... I just want

01:25.052 --> 01:26.554
to clear the air, man.

01:27.355 --> 01:28.622
About?

01:28.722 --> 01:30.524
About me and Gabriela.

01:30.624 --> 01:33.261
Let me get this straight.

01:34.395 --> 01:36.997
You're not calling to apologize
for punching me in my face...

01:37.097 --> 01:38.699
My phone's
not exactly blowing up

01:38.799 --> 01:40.334
with apology calls
from you, either.

01:41.135 --> 01:43.837
Look, what do I have
to apologize to you about, Bode?

01:43.937 --> 01:45.906
For walking around in my life
since I've been gone.

01:46.006 --> 01:47.675
You really just... you really
stepped into my spot

01:47.775 --> 01:49.877
in the Cal Fire Leone line
of succession, huh?

01:49.977 --> 01:52.045
You didn't want the spot, Bode.

01:52.146 --> 01:53.714
The Leones are family to me.

01:53.814 --> 01:55.716
Wow. Okay, Jake. All right.

01:55.816 --> 01:57.318
Is that how you treat family?

01:57.418 --> 01:58.852
By being disloyal?

01:58.952 --> 02:00.288
No, Bode.

02:00.388 --> 02:03.090
That's how <i>you</i> treat family.

02:03.191 --> 02:05.159
Your sister died,

02:05.259 --> 02:07.060
and you bailed.

02:07.161 --> 02:10.331
Eve and I stayed, and we helped
pick up the pieces.

02:10.431 --> 02:11.832
Bode, you should be thanking us.

02:11.932 --> 02:13.667
Look, man. You-you and I
have enough baggage, okay?

02:13.767 --> 02:15.369
I'm not calling to add to it.

02:15.469 --> 02:16.870
No. No, no, no.

02:16.970 --> 02:18.606
You were calling
to make me aware

02:18.706 --> 02:20.274
that you were calling
my girlfriend.

02:20.374 --> 02:22.476
I'm making sure that you know
that she and I are just friends.

02:22.576 --> 02:23.844
Nothing more.

02:23.944 --> 02:26.447
Bode, do you think
I'm worried about you?

02:26.547 --> 02:29.217
You literally have nothing
to offer her.

02:30.984 --> 02:32.486
Well, you sound
a little worried.

02:32.586 --> 02:35.423
Gabriela and I are rock solid.

02:35.523 --> 02:37.225
You and I?

02:37.325 --> 02:41.094
Bode, you were gone for so long,
we assumed you were dead.

02:41.195 --> 02:43.631
Mm. All right.

02:43.731 --> 02:45.566
I'm done worrying about you.

02:45.666 --> 02:47.335
I shouldn't have called.

02:47.435 --> 02:48.869
No, you shouldn't have.

03:01.782 --> 03:04.418
Hey.

03:04.518 --> 03:07.288
Thank you
for meeting me here so early.

03:07.388 --> 03:10.991
I'm gonna take the guys up
to Devil's Slide this morning.

03:11.792 --> 03:13.694
You remember
when we went hiking up there?

03:13.794 --> 03:15.729
We saw those baby eagles?

03:15.829 --> 03:18.599
Not really in the mood
to reminisce.

03:19.400 --> 03:22.903
How long are we gonna
keep doing this, Gabriela?

03:23.003 --> 03:24.338
Hmm?

03:24.438 --> 03:26.440
I mean, emptying out
the-the closet--

03:26.540 --> 03:27.975
that was a nice touch.

03:28.075 --> 03:30.478
That wasn't a touch.
I'm moving out.

03:30.578 --> 03:33.581
You know, crashing at Jake's
house-- that's not moving out.

03:33.681 --> 03:35.983
It's time to come home.

03:36.083 --> 03:38.586
I thought you asked me here
to apologize.

03:38.686 --> 03:40.821
Apologize?

03:40.921 --> 03:42.623
For what?

03:42.723 --> 03:44.492
Having an opinion
about your life?

03:44.592 --> 03:47.328
You never missed a first
of mine.

03:47.428 --> 03:52.032
Every recital, science fair,
swim meet, you were there.

03:52.132 --> 03:55.269
And my first day at Cal Fire,
you were silent.

04:00.107 --> 04:02.643
I never looked at it like that.

04:04.278 --> 04:06.246
I'm sorry, <i>mija.</i>

04:06.347 --> 04:08.282
Thank you.

04:08.382 --> 04:10.451
So will you come back home?

04:10.551 --> 04:13.521
At least
for Sunday dinner?

04:13.621 --> 04:15.055
I'd love to.

04:15.155 --> 04:17.991
Makes me happy.

04:18.091 --> 04:20.861
Under one condition.

04:21.862 --> 04:24.532
You accept that I'm Cal Fire.

04:24.632 --> 04:26.400
It's done.

04:26.500 --> 04:27.835
The only thing left to do is

04:27.935 --> 04:30.037
for you to accept it
and support me.

04:33.407 --> 04:36.043
You know I won't do that.

04:39.713 --> 04:42.215
Then you know why
I won't come home.

04:49.657 --> 04:51.559
Hey, sorry. I'm on my way.

04:51.659 --> 04:53.427
Fire just wouldn't quit.

04:53.527 --> 04:55.195
Babe, it's fine.
There's a fire.

04:55.295 --> 04:57.230
That's what
you're supposed to do.

04:57.331 --> 04:59.900
I'm here already.

05:00.000 --> 05:02.803
I just... I hate
that I let you down.

05:02.903 --> 05:04.505
You called,
and you want to be here,

05:04.605 --> 05:08.075
and that means everything to me,
and it will mean a lot to Bode.

05:11.211 --> 05:13.747
Mom?
Hey.

05:13.847 --> 05:16.550
Did I know
you were coming today?

05:16.650 --> 05:18.819
No, I'm a surprise.

05:18.919 --> 05:20.954
Hi, Bode boy. Hey.

05:21.054 --> 05:22.356
Mmm.

05:22.456 --> 05:25.659
Ah, your dad is here, too...
on the phone.

05:25.759 --> 05:28.295
We... we need to talk to you.

05:28.396 --> 05:30.297
Okay.

05:30.398 --> 05:32.165
Who died?

05:32.265 --> 05:34.134
Nobody's dying.

05:34.234 --> 05:36.570
This is...
It's pretty serious, though.

05:36.670 --> 05:38.372
Um...

05:38.472 --> 05:40.908
I'm sick.

05:42.543 --> 05:45.379
I have chronic kidney disease.

05:48.616 --> 05:50.651
Why didn't you tell me?

05:51.452 --> 05:54.187
'Cause I didn't want
to add to your stress here.

05:59.192 --> 06:01.228
Kidney disease?

06:01.328 --> 06:02.830
From wha...? From what?

06:02.930 --> 06:06.467
Just pulling
the genetic short straw.

06:06.567 --> 06:08.636
Years of fighting fires
didn't help, either.

06:08.736 --> 06:12.172
Dehydration, hyperthermia.

06:12.272 --> 06:14.341
Hazards of the job.

06:16.810 --> 06:18.712
Okay.

06:18.812 --> 06:21.815
How-how can I help? W...

06:21.915 --> 06:23.817
Do you need...
do you need a transplant?

06:23.917 --> 06:25.819
Not yet.
A transplant is the goal,

06:25.919 --> 06:27.988
but I need dialysis first.

06:30.858 --> 06:33.126
I need you to do good time.

06:33.226 --> 06:35.429
I mean, like,
your next parole hearing is

06:35.529 --> 06:37.898
in five and a half months, and
I need you to show that board

06:37.998 --> 06:39.800
that you are a changed man.

06:39.900 --> 06:42.803
I need you
to follow every rule,

06:42.903 --> 06:44.905
fly under the radar,
I need you

06:45.005 --> 06:46.774
to keep the peace with everyone.

06:46.874 --> 06:49.777
That means Jake, too.

06:51.111 --> 06:52.780
What's he got to do with this?

06:52.880 --> 06:54.682
We just don't need a repeat
of the Buckeye

06:54.782 --> 06:56.249
fire when you punched him.

06:56.349 --> 06:58.586
Because every one
of those write-ups can hurt you.

06:58.686 --> 07:03.190
I really need you at home now.

07:05.959 --> 07:08.061
That would make
your mama really happy.

07:08.161 --> 07:10.197
Can you do that for me?

07:12.466 --> 07:14.468
Yeah, Mom.

07:14.568 --> 07:17.237
Thank you.

07:17.337 --> 07:19.206
Thank you, Bode.

07:33.621 --> 07:35.689
Hey, Cap, a word?

07:35.789 --> 07:37.491
What is it, Bode?

07:37.591 --> 07:39.627
I need to parole.

07:39.727 --> 07:42.195
Yeah, you and everyone else.

07:42.295 --> 07:44.064
Look, can-can
you bring my case up

07:44.164 --> 07:45.799
to the parole board early?

07:45.899 --> 07:48.736
Tell them I'm doing
good time?

07:48.836 --> 07:50.237
You're joking, right?

07:50.337 --> 07:52.205
I just yanked you
from First Saw.

07:52.305 --> 07:53.974
I'm not gonna go lying
to the parole board for you.

07:54.074 --> 07:55.643
Then-then... then
put me on more calls.

07:55.743 --> 07:59.046
Fires-- they knock off extra
time off my sentence, right?

07:59.146 --> 08:01.649
I'll-I'll do double time,
man, triple time.

08:01.749 --> 08:04.451
Bode, that's not
how it works.

08:04.552 --> 08:07.420
You go to the calls
I tell you to go to. That's it.

08:10.791 --> 08:12.760
Please.

08:12.860 --> 08:15.128
My mom's sick.

08:16.664 --> 08:18.566
I heard.

08:18.666 --> 08:20.734
I'm sorry about that.

08:20.834 --> 08:22.903
But rules are rules.
I mean, there's got

08:23.003 --> 08:24.838
to be exceptions to be made,
right? Cle-Clearly?

08:24.938 --> 08:27.941
Man, your entire existence at
Fire Camp is an exception, Bode.

08:28.041 --> 08:30.310
And so far, all it's done
is bite me in the ass.

08:30.410 --> 08:32.746
I'm focused now.

08:32.846 --> 08:35.215
You answer to me,
but I answer to people, too.

08:35.315 --> 08:37.217
People like your Uncle Luke,
who's starting to realize

08:37.317 --> 08:39.553
that you staying after going
rogue doesn't quite add up.

08:39.653 --> 08:41.922
But I-I know Uncle Luke
likes to stir the pot,

08:42.022 --> 08:43.190
but he wouldn't rat
on a fellow firefighter.

08:43.290 --> 08:44.625
Yeah, but your Uncle Luke
is also a PR guy

08:44.725 --> 08:46.159
who knows all too well
that things aren't always

08:46.259 --> 08:48.428
the way they're supposed
to be. Hold up!

08:48.528 --> 08:51.765
From here on out,
everything's by the book.

08:51.865 --> 08:53.166
You understand that?

08:53.266 --> 08:55.235
So stop buzzing around asking

08:55.335 --> 08:57.404
for early release like
a quarterback on prom night.

08:57.504 --> 09:01.809
I'm your boss.
I'm not your buddy.

09:06.246 --> 09:08.548
Help! Please! Help me!

09:08.649 --> 09:11.184
Let's go!

09:17.958 --> 09:19.259
Yo.

09:19.359 --> 09:21.361
Would you look
at this roast duck?

09:21.461 --> 09:23.263
This is what
Aydan does for fun.

09:23.363 --> 09:26.099
My fridge is never empty.
I mean...

09:26.199 --> 09:28.568
I really like her, Jake.

09:31.138 --> 09:33.173
Damn it.

09:33.273 --> 09:36.409
Yo, are you trying to fix
the engine or murder it?

09:40.213 --> 09:42.349
Bode called me today.

09:42.449 --> 09:44.351
Whoa. Why?

09:44.451 --> 09:47.788
He called to tell me that he
and Gabriela are just friends.

09:47.888 --> 09:50.523
What? Do you think he's trying
to make a move, or...?

09:50.624 --> 09:52.125
I don't know.
I-I think

09:52.225 --> 09:54.461
he's trying to get a rise
out of me, though.

09:54.561 --> 09:56.797
Well, is it working?
No.

09:56.897 --> 09:58.298
I don't know.

09:58.398 --> 10:01.101
You know, maybe...
maybe he's making peace.

10:01.201 --> 10:02.903
You know, we've changed
since he's left,

10:03.003 --> 10:04.504
and maybe he did, too.

10:04.604 --> 10:06.306
Look, I'm sorry, but

10:06.406 --> 10:08.141
actions have consequences.
Mm-hmm.

10:08.241 --> 10:10.811
And ever since he's been here...
he punched me,

10:10.911 --> 10:12.112
I let that slide. Right.

10:12.212 --> 10:14.314
He calls my girl, I move on.

10:14.414 --> 10:17.484
But then he calls me
and rubs it in face?

10:17.584 --> 10:18.886
I can't let that slide, Eve.

10:18.986 --> 10:21.221
And you know it.

10:23.423 --> 10:25.859
We're following your voice!
Help!

10:25.959 --> 10:27.194
Keep yelling!

10:27.294 --> 10:28.561
Cal Fire's coming to you!

10:28.662 --> 10:30.363
Here.
I'm slipping!

10:30.463 --> 10:31.665
Oh, my God!

10:32.900 --> 10:35.535
Help! I'm slipping!

10:35.635 --> 10:38.005
All right, I'm gonna
reach over. You grab my legs.

10:38.105 --> 10:40.340
You ready? All right. Yeah.

10:41.208 --> 10:43.543
I got you!

10:43.643 --> 10:44.778
We got you! I got you!

10:44.878 --> 10:46.880
There you go.

10:48.716 --> 10:50.684
I tried to hold on to her.
I really tried.

10:50.784 --> 10:52.085
Wait, wait, wait. Who?

10:52.185 --> 10:53.586
Who'd you try to hold on to?

10:53.687 --> 10:55.956
Kirsten.
Kirsten. Where's Kirsten?

10:56.056 --> 10:58.025
There.
Okay.

10:58.125 --> 11:00.861
Please, help her.

11:00.961 --> 11:02.662
Hey, Cap?

11:05.332 --> 11:07.968
Greencrest,
Three Rock Crew Four.

11:08.068 --> 11:09.536
We got a hiker over the edge

11:09.636 --> 11:11.638
about three miles south
of Devil's Slide Trailhead.

11:11.739 --> 11:14.808
Requesting a helitack for
hoist rescue, two engine crews,

11:14.908 --> 11:16.209
and a code three ambulance.

11:16.309 --> 11:18.545
You keep your eyes on her. Yeah.

11:53.914 --> 11:56.416
Okay, I need the patient's
status and a couple of your guys

11:56.516 --> 11:58.118
to clear space
for helitack to land.

11:58.218 --> 11:59.552
Already on it. I need
to coordinate with the chief.

11:59.652 --> 12:00.754
Vince is out today.

12:00.854 --> 12:02.055
Yeah, I'm stepping up
on his behalf,

12:02.155 --> 12:03.623
so it's me that you'll be
coordinating with.

12:03.723 --> 12:06.059
Wow. Okay.
Some pretty big shoes to fill.

12:06.159 --> 12:07.627
He can handle it.

12:08.428 --> 12:10.931
Patient one, Amber, is stable.

12:11.031 --> 12:13.500
Helitack is about five minutes
out for patient two rescue.

12:13.600 --> 12:14.835
Her name's Kirsten.

12:14.935 --> 12:16.169
Her friend said that
she fell off the cliff

12:16.269 --> 12:17.604
trying to take a selfie.

12:17.704 --> 12:19.606
Geez. All that for a picture?
Yeah, right? Kids.

12:19.706 --> 12:21.842
Okay, I'll oversee
the hoist rescue from here.

12:21.942 --> 12:24.377
Gabriela, we'll need
the medical bag and gloves.

12:24.477 --> 12:26.213
On it. Eve,

12:26.313 --> 12:28.181
use the sewer cam to check
on the patient down there.

12:28.281 --> 12:30.517
If anything shows that can
that she is still alive,

12:30.617 --> 12:31.919
I want to know.
You got it.

12:32.019 --> 12:33.921
Manny, I'll take over
the patient from here.

12:34.021 --> 12:35.255
Copy.

12:35.355 --> 12:37.257
Hey, Bode, I guess
Crawford's got this one.

12:37.357 --> 12:38.992
Why don't you cut some brush
with the guys?

12:44.064 --> 12:45.765
For real?

12:45.866 --> 12:47.767
You heard your captain.

12:47.868 --> 12:50.037
You should get back
with your crew.

12:56.776 --> 12:59.212
What's my blood pressure?

12:59.312 --> 13:00.413
Don't worry about it.

13:00.513 --> 13:02.582
Come on. I want the number.

13:02.682 --> 13:04.784
150/95.

13:04.885 --> 13:06.786
Oh, come on.

13:06.887 --> 13:10.023
That is the blood pressure
of a sedentary,

13:10.123 --> 13:12.492
out-of-shape,
Wall Street broker.

13:12.592 --> 13:15.028
Give me that. You did it wrong.

13:16.796 --> 13:18.698
Don't just stand there
staring at me.

13:18.798 --> 13:20.500
You're gonna make me nervous.

13:20.600 --> 13:24.938
Right. It's my fault
you have high blood pressure.

13:25.805 --> 13:27.207
Not the kidney disease

13:27.307 --> 13:30.510
or the dialysis tube
sticking out of your stomach.

13:30.610 --> 13:33.213
Or the fact that you just had
to tell your incarcerated son

13:33.313 --> 13:34.614
that you're sick.

13:38.919 --> 13:41.154
How do you think
he took it, by the way?

13:41.254 --> 13:43.756
You heard him, didn't you?
Yeah.

13:43.857 --> 13:46.193
But we both know Bode.

13:46.293 --> 13:49.029
He-he can seem
fine, and then...

13:49.129 --> 13:51.464
He is fine. He's really strong.
He can take it.

13:51.564 --> 13:54.301
And so can I. Honestly, babe,
you should head back to work.

13:54.401 --> 13:58.671
I'm just gonna be sitting here
for the next four hours.

13:58.771 --> 14:01.808
Um, no, that's not happening.

14:01.909 --> 14:06.679
I'm your designated
care person,

14:06.779 --> 14:09.682
and... as such,

14:09.782 --> 14:11.684
I am supposed
to take your vitals,

14:11.784 --> 14:15.989
and, yeah, do
whatever they said.

14:16.089 --> 14:20.460
Better make sure that
you're tolerating treatment.

14:22.262 --> 14:25.732
Sorry. I'm not tolerating it
very well, am I?

14:25.832 --> 14:28.168
I think you're doing great.

14:30.470 --> 14:34.474
Which is why I am not
going back to work.

14:36.276 --> 14:39.179
I keep getting texts
from all these people at work

14:39.279 --> 14:43.883
asking why I took the day off
and if I'm okay.

14:43.984 --> 14:46.519
Well, that's funny.
I took the day off, too,

14:46.619 --> 14:48.155
and nobody's
blowing up my phone.

14:50.823 --> 14:52.960
People care about you, Shar.

14:53.060 --> 14:54.995
You know that.
No, they don't.

14:55.095 --> 14:59.132
They care if my job's gonna
suddenly become available.

14:59.232 --> 15:01.134
Who?

15:01.234 --> 15:05.572
The original 120 people
I beat out for it to begin with.

15:05.672 --> 15:07.674
And then, if I'm honest,

15:07.774 --> 15:09.742
your brother Luke.

15:09.842 --> 15:13.513
I know, my brother's
no saint, but he...

15:13.613 --> 15:17.217
He's not gonna take advantage
of you being sick, and...

15:19.019 --> 15:22.789
And as your designated
care person, I-I suggest

15:22.889 --> 15:25.058
that you stop
worrying about work.

15:25.158 --> 15:27.527
Just focus on
your health, please.

15:27.627 --> 15:30.397
I'm never gonna stop worrying
about work.

15:30.497 --> 15:33.166
That job is the only way
I can help Bode.

15:35.235 --> 15:36.769
My number came out
worse than yours.

15:36.869 --> 15:38.438
Maybe it's the batteries.

15:44.344 --> 15:46.246
Well, the good news is the
sprain doesn't look that bad.

15:46.346 --> 15:47.947
What about Kirsten?

15:48.048 --> 15:49.649
Hey, we're doing
everything we can.

15:49.749 --> 15:51.051
It's my fault she fell.

15:51.151 --> 15:54.187
I lost my footing
with my arm around her.

15:54.287 --> 15:55.788
I might've killed
my best friend.

15:55.888 --> 15:58.191
Hey, hey, listen.
Have some faith.

15:58.291 --> 16:00.527
I got my best friend's eyes
on your best friend.

16:00.627 --> 16:02.829
Come on.

16:07.534 --> 16:08.735
I see movement!

16:08.835 --> 16:11.071
She's alive!
Well, look at that, okay?

16:11.171 --> 16:12.872
Now, you're gonna go
to the hospital for this wrist

16:12.972 --> 16:14.307
and leave the worrying
to us, okay?

16:14.407 --> 16:17.110
No. It's my fault she fell.
I'm not leaving her.

16:17.210 --> 16:19.112
It's just a sprain,
I can suck it up.

16:19.212 --> 16:21.881
Okay, but sit tight.

16:24.117 --> 16:28.255
Eve, talk to me.
What do you see?

16:28.355 --> 16:31.524
Semiconscious with an obvious
fracture to the left leg.

16:31.624 --> 16:32.525
We need that copter.

16:32.625 --> 16:34.127
Yeah, and fast.

16:34.227 --> 16:35.495
Weather report says that rain
will be here within the hour

16:35.595 --> 16:36.929
and so will the tide.

16:37.030 --> 16:38.298
And it'll obstruct visibility,

16:38.398 --> 16:40.633
and it could make flying
to the cliff tricky.

16:40.733 --> 16:43.103
Well, we better beat the rain.

16:56.883 --> 16:59.152
Hey, you okay?

16:59.252 --> 17:01.288
Hey.

17:02.655 --> 17:04.324
I've had better days.

17:06.126 --> 17:08.261
You want to talk about it?

17:09.862 --> 17:12.499
I don't think Jake'd be too
happy if he saw us talking.

17:14.501 --> 17:17.504
What's up? You seem off.

17:19.272 --> 17:22.175
Maybe we can talk later.
Gabriela?

17:22.275 --> 17:24.677
You're riding with Eve.
Go get into a harness.

17:24.777 --> 17:26.213
Chopper's about to leave.

17:26.313 --> 17:29.182
Me? But probies never ride
with the helitack crew.

17:29.282 --> 17:31.084
Well, shadowing Eve
is your best way of learning.

17:31.184 --> 17:33.420
She's experienced.
Now go.

17:35.155 --> 17:36.789
You're supposed to be
clearing my landing zone,

17:36.889 --> 17:38.525
not distracting my crew.

17:38.625 --> 17:41.761
And I don't think Captain Perez
would appreciate that, either.

17:41.861 --> 17:44.197
Hey, man, look,
she approached me.

17:44.297 --> 17:47.300
It is never your
fault, is it?

17:47.400 --> 17:48.868
Look, I got bigger things
to worry about

17:48.968 --> 17:50.337
right now
than fighting with you.

17:50.437 --> 17:52.605
Funny. It didn't seem like that
this morning.

17:52.705 --> 17:54.006
That's because, this morning,

17:54.107 --> 17:56.008
I didn't know
that my mom was sick.

17:57.410 --> 18:01.248
Hey, yo.
Copter's one minute away.

18:01.348 --> 18:05.185
What-what do you mean,
your mom's sick?

18:06.786 --> 18:09.088
Bode, is Sharon all right?

18:13.126 --> 18:15.495
Her kidneys are failing.

18:17.029 --> 18:19.966
It sounds pretty serious.

18:20.066 --> 18:21.501
I figured that you two knew.

18:21.601 --> 18:22.802
Well, we didn't.

18:22.902 --> 18:25.238
Bode, I'm so sorry.

18:27.039 --> 18:28.941
Thanks.

18:29.041 --> 18:31.311
Me, too.

18:37.083 --> 18:39.186
Okay.

18:39.286 --> 18:41.654
Chopper's here. Let's move.

18:57.937 --> 19:00.072
Everyone tagged in?

19:00.173 --> 19:01.874
A-firm. Everyone tagged in?

19:01.974 --> 19:03.843
You ready?
I'm ready. You ready?

19:03.943 --> 19:05.845
Rescuer ready!

19:05.945 --> 19:08.615
Permission to open door.

19:14.086 --> 19:16.323
Doors opening.

19:36.108 --> 19:37.544
Go!

19:53.526 --> 19:56.496
Rescuer 25 feet from copter!

19:58.130 --> 19:59.532
40 feet from copter.

19:59.632 --> 20:00.700
Easy.

20:02.201 --> 20:03.636
Hold your forward.

20:03.736 --> 20:05.171
Copy.

20:05.972 --> 20:08.341
It's a damn wind tunnel
out here!

20:10.943 --> 20:12.612
Whoa. Whoa!

20:14.847 --> 20:16.316
Eve! You okay?

20:16.416 --> 20:19.185
The cable... the cables
are tangled in the rocks.

20:19.286 --> 20:20.653
They're out of my reach.

20:20.753 --> 20:21.788
I-I-I'm stuck.

20:21.888 --> 20:23.155
What do we do?!

20:23.256 --> 20:25.091
The copter
is pulling the line too tight.

20:25.191 --> 20:27.827
I need you to cut me loose.

20:27.927 --> 20:29.195
Copy.

20:29.296 --> 20:31.097
What? We do that, and she falls!

20:31.197 --> 20:32.965
Y'all can't hover forever.

20:33.065 --> 20:35.802
My best choice is to fall.

20:35.902 --> 20:37.304
Cut me loose!

20:37.404 --> 20:39.005
Go on. You got to cut her now.

20:39.105 --> 20:39.972
You need to cut.

20:40.072 --> 20:41.308
Yes, sir.

20:41.408 --> 20:42.742
What if we hurt Eve?

20:42.842 --> 20:44.377
We don't get
to choose our lessons,

20:44.477 --> 20:46.012
and this is a tough one.

20:46.112 --> 20:47.514
We're choosing
the lesser of two evils.

20:47.614 --> 20:49.716
If something happens to her,
it's on us.

20:49.816 --> 20:51.451
No, it's on me.

20:51.551 --> 20:54.153
You're just following orders,
but the tail rotor is too close

20:54.253 --> 20:55.822
to the cliff,
so you need to cut now!

20:55.922 --> 20:57.590
Cut it now. I can't
hold this position much longer.

20:57.690 --> 20:59.692
Cut! Cut! Cut!

21:07.233 --> 21:09.502
Eve, did you make the drop okay?

21:10.470 --> 21:12.772
Do you copy, Eve?!

21:14.941 --> 21:16.843
Jake, I'm not hearing her.

21:24.984 --> 21:27.253
Oh.

21:40.767 --> 21:41.868
I don't see Eve.

21:41.968 --> 21:43.135
Negative on visuals
from here.

21:43.235 --> 21:44.371
Manny, snake a camera
down there.

21:44.471 --> 21:45.672
Copy that.

21:45.772 --> 21:47.440
Wait! I see her now!

21:47.540 --> 21:49.709
Eve, I see you. Can you hear me?

21:50.543 --> 21:53.045
She's not responding.
Possible head injury.

21:53.145 --> 21:55.147
Okay, copy. Copter, return
back to the landing zone.

21:55.247 --> 21:57.216
Hey, wh-wha-what
are you doing about Eve?

21:57.316 --> 21:59.085
You can't just
leave her down there.
Bode, I'm not like you.

21:59.185 --> 22:00.453
I don't bail on people.

22:00.553 --> 22:02.054
Come on, guys!

22:02.154 --> 22:04.223
We have a firefighter
down there,

22:04.323 --> 22:07.326
and quite possibly
a very shaken probie

22:07.427 --> 22:09.128
who had to cut her loose.

22:09.228 --> 22:11.764
Now, Jake, you called me out
on my probie treatment

22:11.864 --> 22:13.766
on our last fire,
and you were right.

22:13.866 --> 22:15.668
So we need to take a breath.

22:15.768 --> 22:19.739
We need to adjust, and we need
to find our plan B for Eve.

22:19.839 --> 22:21.908
You're right.
Yes, Cap.

22:44.230 --> 22:45.532
Helitack, Rescuer One.

22:45.632 --> 22:48.134
I've dislocated my shoulder,
but operational.

22:48.234 --> 22:51.037
Going to make contact
with the patient. Over.

22:51.938 --> 22:53.740
Helitack, do you copy?!

23:05.051 --> 23:07.286
It's time for
a manual approach.

23:07.386 --> 23:09.288
A belay system
is our best option.

23:09.388 --> 23:12.024
We'll anchor to the engine
and use this stump as safety.

23:12.124 --> 23:14.060
And it's the quickest
with that tide moving in fast.

23:14.160 --> 23:15.928
Are you okay?
Yeah.

23:16.028 --> 23:18.030
Just, the wind up there
was unreal.

23:18.130 --> 23:19.432
All right, all right, look,

23:19.532 --> 23:21.000
I'm gonna need your crew
to work the system.

23:21.100 --> 23:23.102
Absolutely. You got it.
I'll be on it, too.

23:23.202 --> 23:24.904
Okay, Manny,
we're gonna need your expertise

23:25.004 --> 23:26.305
up here as the edge person.

23:26.405 --> 23:27.840
Okay.
I'm gonna need
a rescue partner.

23:27.940 --> 23:29.241
Normally, I would take Eve.

23:29.341 --> 23:30.810
We rock-climbed here growing up.

23:30.910 --> 23:33.379
We all did, man--
you, me, Eve, Riley.

23:33.480 --> 23:35.214
We must have scaled this thing
a million times.

23:35.314 --> 23:38.117
Now, Bode...
No. No, no, Bode's right.

23:38.217 --> 23:40.453
Okay, listen, we'll go down
together. Harness up.

23:40.553 --> 23:43.523
No. Uh-uh. Uh-uh. You two are
a powder keg about to blow.

23:43.623 --> 23:45.592
The answer's "no," Jake. No.
Manny, listen to me.

23:45.692 --> 23:48.060
Listen, Manny, Manny, look,
we got two people down there

23:48.160 --> 23:49.762
that we have to save,
and no time.

23:49.862 --> 23:52.499
Uh, we have
a shorthand, Cap.

23:52.599 --> 23:53.833
We can do this.

23:53.933 --> 23:55.902
And you really want
to take this risk?

23:56.002 --> 23:58.170
Anybody else,
and it <i>would</i> be a risk.

23:58.270 --> 24:00.006
Listen, Bode is our best option.

24:00.106 --> 24:02.408
The lesser of two evils.

24:02.509 --> 24:05.578
Man, you do everything
that he tells you to do.

24:05.678 --> 24:07.313
Everything. No defiance.

24:07.413 --> 24:09.415
You check your personal crap
before you put their lives

24:09.516 --> 24:11.283
into your hands.
You understood me?

24:11.383 --> 24:12.552
Yes, Cap.

24:12.652 --> 24:13.886
Okay.
Good. Let's go.

24:13.986 --> 24:16.255
We got lives to save, people!
And hey!

24:16.355 --> 24:17.790
Be safe!

24:17.890 --> 24:19.526
Perez, you're with me.

24:19.626 --> 24:21.160
Three Rock!

24:28.067 --> 24:29.536
Oh, no.

24:29.636 --> 24:30.870
Kirsten!

24:30.970 --> 24:33.039
The tide's too close already.

24:39.111 --> 24:40.947
All right.

24:45.184 --> 24:46.886
All right.

24:50.122 --> 24:51.658
Equal and reactive.

24:51.758 --> 24:54.160
Kirsten, can you hear me?

24:54.260 --> 24:56.495
My name is Eve.
I'm a firefighter.

24:56.596 --> 24:58.565
I'm here to help you, okay?

25:06.172 --> 25:07.540
Open femur fracture.

25:07.640 --> 25:09.909
Not good. All right.

25:10.009 --> 25:12.244
Kirsten, can you hear me?

25:12.344 --> 25:14.981
Kirsten, you're waking up. Good.

25:15.081 --> 25:16.382
But I need you to stay still

25:16.482 --> 25:18.751
so you don't hurt yourself
any more, okay?

25:20.219 --> 25:21.754
What?
No, no, no, no.

25:21.854 --> 25:24.757
Easy, easy, easy,
easy, easy, easy.

25:24.857 --> 25:26.292
Where am I?

25:26.392 --> 25:28.494
No, you just...
you had a bad fall.

25:28.595 --> 25:30.963
Deep breaths.

25:31.063 --> 25:33.132
Is that my bone?!
Kirsten, stay with me.

25:33.232 --> 25:35.134
You're okay. You're sa--

25:35.234 --> 25:38.470
Aah! Come on, Jake! Hurry!

25:44.510 --> 25:46.078
Steady. Steady.

25:46.178 --> 25:47.947
This is a good pace. Copy.
We'll maintain speed.

25:48.047 --> 25:50.282
All right, we got 20 minutes
before downpour.

25:50.382 --> 25:52.885
How you doing?

25:52.985 --> 25:56.723
A little rusty, but
muscle memory's still there.

25:56.823 --> 25:58.057
Okay.

25:59.158 --> 26:00.292
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Hey, oh.

26:00.392 --> 26:02.228
All right, stop. All stop.
Stop, stop, stop.

26:02.328 --> 26:04.263
I think I'm stuck.

26:05.364 --> 26:07.600
Yeah, my line's snagged.

26:10.036 --> 26:11.671
Hey, up on Bode.

26:11.771 --> 26:14.040
Up on Bode.

26:17.877 --> 26:19.646
Okay, stop on Bode.

26:19.746 --> 26:21.580
Stop on Bode.

26:23.582 --> 26:26.118
Got it.

26:26.218 --> 26:28.054
Good?
I'm good.

26:29.889 --> 26:31.958
Okay. Down on Bode.

26:32.058 --> 26:34.426
Down on Bode.

26:34.526 --> 26:36.729
All right.

26:36.829 --> 26:38.264
Let's go.

26:38.364 --> 26:39.966
Stop on Bode.

26:40.066 --> 26:41.100
You good?

26:41.200 --> 26:43.469
Little less rusty
than I thought.

26:43.569 --> 26:45.905
All right, all good.

26:46.005 --> 26:48.775
Lower on both.
Okay, keep going.

26:48.875 --> 26:50.943
Gentlemen,
we defect to this line.

26:51.043 --> 26:54.113
Slow and steady.
That's our ticket, all right?

26:54.213 --> 26:57.049
Mechanical advantage.
It's a beautiful thing.

26:57.149 --> 26:59.986
That's what's gonna help us lift
a few hundred pounds up a cliff.

27:02.588 --> 27:03.856
Don't fight the line, firefighter.

27:03.956 --> 27:05.725
You want to show me how?

27:07.526 --> 27:09.128
Flip your wrist.
Back side in.

27:09.228 --> 27:12.431
Pull it back, right in the
groove. Watch your thumb.

27:12.531 --> 27:15.101
Let the system help you.

27:15.201 --> 27:17.269
How's it feel?

27:17.369 --> 27:19.205
Way better.

27:19.305 --> 27:21.340
Way better?

27:30.850 --> 27:32.651
Here you go, Chief.

27:32.752 --> 27:34.620
Well, well, well. I was

27:34.721 --> 27:37.656
wondering if I was ever gonna
see my big brother around town.

27:38.825 --> 27:41.928
Um, yeah, here I am.

27:42.729 --> 27:45.765
You look like crap.
You sleeping enough?

27:45.865 --> 27:48.334
Well, I was till I heard
you were in town.

27:48.434 --> 27:49.969
Hey, funny guy. Sit down.
Join me for lunch.

27:50.069 --> 27:52.338
No. Uh, just
getting some takeout.

27:52.438 --> 27:54.240
What? The firehouse
doesn't serve lunch anymore?

27:54.340 --> 27:56.075
Day off.

27:56.175 --> 27:58.177
Day off?
You never take a day off.

27:58.277 --> 28:01.814
Well, you never seem to work,
so that evens out, doesn't it?

28:01.914 --> 28:03.615
Well, it's funny
you should mention that,

28:03.716 --> 28:06.385
'cause I was thinking about
taking a job here in town.

28:06.485 --> 28:07.754
Really?
Mm-hmm.

28:07.854 --> 28:09.488
Who's hiring?

28:09.588 --> 28:11.190
Well, word on the street is
that they're looking

28:11.290 --> 28:13.059
for someone to fill in
for division chief.

28:13.159 --> 28:15.728
Which is strange because
Sharon is division chief.

28:15.828 --> 28:17.596
Last time I saw her,
she didn't mention anything

28:17.696 --> 28:19.198
about stepping down.

28:19.298 --> 28:20.699
Yeah, she's not.

28:20.800 --> 28:22.101
What's the deal, Vince?

28:22.201 --> 28:24.937
You finally taking her
on that vacation?

28:26.205 --> 28:29.175
Luke, stay out of this,
all right?

28:29.275 --> 28:32.411
Stay out of what? Oh. Oh,
look at that. Perfect timing.

28:32.511 --> 28:33.612
If you don't want to tell me

28:33.712 --> 28:34.680
what's going on,
I'll just ask her.

28:34.781 --> 28:35.815
What are you doing here?

28:35.915 --> 28:37.183
I told you I was
going to get food.

28:37.283 --> 28:38.217
I'm here for him.

28:38.317 --> 28:40.086
What's up, Shar?
You tell me.

28:40.186 --> 28:42.855
Uh, I don't
know. These prices.

28:42.955 --> 28:45.024
I guess inflation is
hitting everybody. Hey, hey!

28:45.124 --> 28:46.826
Don't be such a smart-ass.
Tell him. Hey...

28:46.926 --> 28:48.227
Tell Vince what you did

28:48.327 --> 28:49.996
to make the board put me
on a leave of absence.

28:50.096 --> 28:51.697
Um, Sharon,
blood pressure...

28:51.798 --> 28:54.200
Screw my blood pressure! I just
got an email from the board

28:54.300 --> 28:56.235
temporarily asking me
to step down.

28:56.335 --> 28:57.736
He's the only one
who knew.

28:57.837 --> 29:00.106
He saw me after
my doctor's appointment.

29:06.378 --> 29:08.047
What are you doing?

29:08.147 --> 29:09.949
Oh, good. You're awake again.

29:10.049 --> 29:11.617
I'm looking for a pulse.

29:11.717 --> 29:14.186
Wouldn't I be... dead otherwise?

29:14.286 --> 29:15.955
Your distal pulse.

29:16.055 --> 29:18.157
Just want to make sure
you didn't nick an artery.

29:19.892 --> 29:22.261
Okay. I got a pulse.

29:22.361 --> 29:25.431
But I need
to apply a tourniquet.

29:27.099 --> 29:29.601
Wait. Wait. With...
with one arm?

29:31.938 --> 29:34.040
Yeah. I'm doing
the best I can do.

29:34.140 --> 29:35.407
I'm a little

29:35.507 --> 29:38.244
type-A. I-I like things
to be done properly,

29:38.344 --> 29:41.147
especially
if you ask Amber.

29:41.247 --> 29:42.248
How is she?

29:42.348 --> 29:44.783
She's worried about you.

29:46.953 --> 29:50.356
Stopping here was her idea.

29:50.456 --> 29:52.959
I was so annoyed
about losing travel time,

29:53.059 --> 29:55.094
I didn't even enjoy the view.

29:55.194 --> 29:59.498
Like I said, type-A,
I like a plan.

29:59.598 --> 30:02.134
I-I mean,

30:02.234 --> 30:05.471
look what happens when
you suddenly change the plan.

30:05.571 --> 30:10.809
I hate to say this, but I have
to change the plan on you.

30:10.910 --> 30:13.212
And normally, I would apply
a tourniquet.

30:13.312 --> 30:14.713
Yes, please.

30:14.813 --> 30:17.049
But because I only have one arm,

30:17.149 --> 30:19.751
and I'm alone, I need your help.

30:19.852 --> 30:21.753
I'm-I'm no paramedic! I...
No, no, no.

30:21.854 --> 30:23.422
I'm-I'm...
Listen, I'm-I'm a math major.

30:23.522 --> 30:25.591
I have, like, literally
no relevant skills here.

30:25.691 --> 30:28.427
All I need you to do is
to hold it in place.

30:28.527 --> 30:30.629
And I'm sorry,
but it's gonna hurt.

30:33.565 --> 30:35.667
Come on, come on, let's go.

30:35.767 --> 30:37.103
There you go.
Come on, come on, come on.

30:37.203 --> 30:39.138
Just hold it right here.

30:39.238 --> 30:40.940
There you go.
There you go.

30:41.040 --> 30:43.976
Okay, all right,
eyes to the sky.

30:44.076 --> 30:46.745
It's a beautiful day!
Enjoy it!

30:46.845 --> 30:48.480
Like you wish
you did earlier, okay?

30:53.519 --> 30:55.454
I am the reason
you still come to Thanksgiving.

30:55.554 --> 30:58.457
I make your mother's mashed
potatoes the way you like them,

30:58.557 --> 31:00.226
not the way
my husband likes them,

31:00.326 --> 31:03.362
because we are a family
before co-workers.

31:03.462 --> 31:04.863
So I thought never.

31:04.964 --> 31:07.066
Never did I think
you would stoop so low

31:07.166 --> 31:09.668
just to climb
the Cal Fire ladder.

31:09.768 --> 31:11.537
Wh-Wh... Where
are you going?

31:11.637 --> 31:14.306
I'm going to my office
so everyone knows I'm fine.

31:14.406 --> 31:16.742
No, you're not.

31:16.842 --> 31:19.178
You told Bode to keep
his cool, right?

31:19.278 --> 31:21.647
I'm asking you
to do the same thing.

31:21.747 --> 31:24.083
You had dialysis
today, okay?

31:24.183 --> 31:25.918
You need to take it easy.
I'm gonna take you home.

31:26.018 --> 31:27.053
Sharon.

31:27.153 --> 31:29.855
Don't! I'm not going home.

31:40.666 --> 31:42.601
Eve, talk to me.

31:42.701 --> 31:44.570
All right. Ah!

31:46.105 --> 31:48.207
Have a patient with
an open femur fracture,

31:48.307 --> 31:51.077
I've dislocated
my shoulder-- Bode?

31:51.177 --> 31:54.613
What? You guys came down
the cliff together?

31:56.482 --> 31:58.117
You applied a tourniquet
with one arm?

31:58.217 --> 32:01.453
Yeah. Well, Kirsten assisted.
I needed some help.

32:01.553 --> 32:02.754
Yeah, well, so did I.

32:02.854 --> 32:04.156
All right, let's hurry up.

32:04.256 --> 32:05.824
High tide is coming any minute.

32:05.924 --> 32:08.127
All right, you take her up
and then come back down for me.

32:08.227 --> 32:09.561
Yeah, that's a no-go.

32:09.661 --> 32:11.263
Between the tide, the rain...

32:11.363 --> 32:12.631
And with your arm,
if we don't make it

32:12.731 --> 32:13.765
back in time, you'll drown.

32:13.865 --> 32:16.068
Well, even if we do this,

32:16.168 --> 32:17.936
hauling the four of us
is too heavy.

32:18.037 --> 32:19.671
Not if we share the load. Exactly.

32:19.771 --> 32:22.008
Look, between the three of us,
we can split the weight

32:22.108 --> 32:24.010
and make it up
all at once, together.

32:24.110 --> 32:25.844
Y'all are crazy.

32:25.944 --> 32:28.480
Took you this long
to realize that?

32:29.982 --> 32:32.218
Okay, we're almost there.

32:32.318 --> 32:34.620
Bode, get ready.

32:36.888 --> 32:38.590
On three.

32:38.690 --> 32:40.426
One, two, three.

32:41.727 --> 32:43.429
I got her.

32:43.529 --> 32:45.564
Okay.

32:51.703 --> 32:53.139
Let's move.

32:53.239 --> 32:56.242
Keep pulling, keep pulling!

32:58.110 --> 33:01.413
Come on, guys,
pull together as a team.

33:01.513 --> 33:02.448
That's it.

33:02.548 --> 33:05.117
Slow and steady,
slow and steady.

33:06.352 --> 33:08.154
Hey, hey, hang on, Eve.

33:08.254 --> 33:10.089
You're doing great.
We're almost there.

33:10.856 --> 33:12.091
We're so close.

33:13.125 --> 33:14.493
All right, I see them.

33:14.593 --> 33:17.263
Keep hauling.
We're almost out of the woods.

33:20.532 --> 33:22.701
Why aren't we moving?
The line's held up.

33:22.801 --> 33:24.070
Where are we?

33:24.170 --> 33:25.304
Manny, we're stalled.

33:25.404 --> 33:27.173
Copy that,
might be a system's fail.

33:27.273 --> 33:29.608
Stand by.
Oh, no, no,
no, no, no, no, no.

33:29.708 --> 33:31.043
I have the spins.

33:31.143 --> 33:32.478
Are-are we falling?

33:32.578 --> 33:34.313
No, eyes to the sky.
We've got you, Kirsten.

33:34.413 --> 33:36.315
Okay, listen, Manny,
we got a critical patient.

33:36.415 --> 33:38.317
Where are we
with the system failure?

33:41.787 --> 33:43.389
The anchor is giving in!

33:43.489 --> 33:46.392
We lose those anchor points,
we lose them.

33:56.102 --> 33:57.836
Hold the line!

33:59.871 --> 34:02.941
Go to the anchor point and
make sure the Prusik is secure.

34:03.041 --> 34:04.310
Hurry!

34:05.744 --> 34:07.346
The Prusik is slipping!

34:07.446 --> 34:08.814
We're losing traction.

34:08.914 --> 34:10.982
Gabriela, you need to
bridge that line

34:11.083 --> 34:13.652
fast or the system could fail.

34:17.956 --> 34:21.059
I'm gonna double up on
the Prusik to stop the slipping.

34:27.433 --> 34:28.967
Okay, pull!
Go, go, go!

34:29.067 --> 34:30.669
All right, boys,
we're back in business!

34:30.769 --> 34:33.004
Gabriela,
help me work the edge.

34:37.676 --> 34:39.411
Clip me in so I
can pull them up.

34:39.511 --> 34:41.513
Done, you're good
to approach the edge.

34:41.613 --> 34:42.714
Good,
we've almost got them.

34:44.783 --> 34:46.652
Good job, Kirsten.

34:46.752 --> 34:48.454
Stay with us, all right?

34:48.554 --> 34:49.955
We're almost there.

34:50.055 --> 34:51.323
I got you.

35:04.836 --> 35:06.405
You all right there, Eve?

35:06.505 --> 35:07.806
Not too good.

35:07.906 --> 35:09.608
On my three, you ready?

35:09.708 --> 35:12.644
One, two, three.

35:20.018 --> 35:21.253
Kirsten!

35:21.353 --> 35:22.954
Are you okay?

35:23.054 --> 35:24.690
I'm so sorry.
I'm so sorry.

35:24.790 --> 35:27.393
I didn't mean to.
It's not your fault.
It's not your fault.

35:28.927 --> 35:31.297
I can't believe
we used to do that for fun.

35:32.964 --> 35:34.566
That was
a long time ago.

35:34.666 --> 35:37.836
Yeah. But I made it
to the top first,

35:37.936 --> 35:40.406
so glad to see
some things haven't changed.

35:40.506 --> 35:42.841
You didn't always win.

35:42.941 --> 35:45.611
No. But most of the time.

35:45.711 --> 35:48.013
Boys, boys.
Nobody cares.

35:48.113 --> 35:50.148
All right?

35:50.249 --> 35:52.751
This kind of feels
like old times.

35:52.851 --> 35:54.386
Bode.

35:55.654 --> 35:57.055
Let's load up.

36:04.930 --> 36:07.132
And now it's over.

36:12.304 --> 36:15.106
You know what I liked
most about you diving?

36:18.577 --> 36:20.479
Let's not do this again,
Dad, please.

36:20.579 --> 36:22.914
That look on your face

36:23.014 --> 36:25.050
every time you dove.

36:25.150 --> 36:27.786
I saw that same look today

36:27.886 --> 36:29.588
when you reinforced
that anchor point.

36:29.688 --> 36:31.022
It's good thinking.

36:31.122 --> 36:33.925
Mm, for a probie.

36:37.229 --> 36:41.199
Is this Captain Perez
paying me a compliment

36:41.300 --> 36:44.403
or my dad giving me
his blessing?

36:46.938 --> 36:48.807
As a dad,

36:48.907 --> 36:52.811
my daughter's dreams
are my dreams.

36:54.913 --> 36:56.582
And I am so proud
of you, <i>mija.</i>

37:00.085 --> 37:04.756
I know...
diving was expensive.

37:04.856 --> 37:07.759
And you sacrificed a lot
so that I could do it.

37:07.859 --> 37:09.328
And...

37:09.428 --> 37:14.099
instead of vacations,
and new cars and houses,

37:14.199 --> 37:16.067
we had diving.

37:16.167 --> 37:19.004
And it was the best money
I ever spent.
And I quit.

37:19.104 --> 37:21.106
No.

37:21.206 --> 37:23.709
You're a professional diver

37:23.809 --> 37:25.877
who completed her career.

37:25.977 --> 37:27.879
And now you have
a new dream.

37:27.979 --> 37:29.548
A dream that makes
you happy.

37:29.648 --> 37:32.250
And only an idiot wouldn't want
that for his daughter.

37:33.519 --> 37:36.221
It just took me a little
while to catch up.

37:36.322 --> 37:37.823
That's all.

37:43.362 --> 37:46.097
Now get back to work.

38:04.249 --> 38:07.085
Hey, can I have
a beer, please?

38:07.185 --> 38:08.920
You got it.
Hey, watch this,

38:09.020 --> 38:11.357
my baby brother's
about to buy me a drink.

38:13.158 --> 38:14.693
Put his drinks on my tab.

38:14.793 --> 38:16.962
Yes, sir.
Ta-da.

38:21.633 --> 38:23.301
Well, I know for a fact

38:23.402 --> 38:26.271
that you weren't the one
who ratted Sharon out.

38:27.673 --> 38:28.907
Why didn't you tell her that?

38:29.007 --> 38:30.809
I saw the look on your face.

38:30.909 --> 38:32.310
I saw you panic.

38:32.411 --> 38:34.813
I figured it was you
who benched her

38:34.913 --> 38:36.382
when her body needed a rest.

38:36.482 --> 38:39.851
I also figured that you did
what you do for family.

38:39.951 --> 38:41.820
You take care of them.

38:41.920 --> 38:44.055
You covered for me?

38:44.823 --> 38:45.991
Why?

38:46.091 --> 38:47.826
Recovery is
a full-time job.

38:47.926 --> 38:50.328
She's gonna need you--
her husband--

38:50.429 --> 38:52.764
hell of a lot more than
she's gonna need me.

38:54.700 --> 38:57.035
Sorry.

38:57.135 --> 39:00.305
You've never stepped up before.
So, why now?

39:00.406 --> 39:05.143
What's in it for you?
Stepping up is
what we do for family.

39:06.978 --> 39:08.246
Forget it, never mind.

39:08.346 --> 39:11.617
Hey, all right.
I'm sorry.

39:15.821 --> 39:17.923
It was a nice thing you did.

39:19.057 --> 39:20.626
And you better drink up

39:20.726 --> 39:23.094
'cause this is
a onetime offer.

39:27.032 --> 39:30.669
Well, then I better order
something top-shelf.
Better not.

39:34.172 --> 39:36.007
To accept, press 1.

39:37.375 --> 39:39.044
Bode, I just heard
about your mom.

39:39.144 --> 39:40.412
I'm so sorry.

39:40.512 --> 39:42.448
Thank you.

39:43.582 --> 39:45.283
How are you feeling?

39:46.317 --> 39:48.319
Like an 18-wheeler ran me over.

39:48.420 --> 39:52.157
How is your mom doing?

39:54.760 --> 39:57.095
I don't know.

39:57.195 --> 39:59.531
It's hard to know
when I'm stuck in here.

40:02.267 --> 40:03.935
I...

40:04.035 --> 40:06.438
I got to get out and go home.

40:06.538 --> 40:08.474
I need to parole.

40:08.574 --> 40:09.875
You will.

40:09.975 --> 40:11.743
Not if I mess up.

40:11.843 --> 40:13.645
You won't.
You'll work the program.

40:13.745 --> 40:15.013
One call at a time.

40:15.113 --> 40:18.283
It was hard to play nice
today, on the call.

40:18.383 --> 40:19.951
And do the right thing
with Jake.

40:20.051 --> 40:21.687
But you did it.

40:21.787 --> 40:23.622
Yeah, but I was terrified
the whole time of messing up,

40:23.722 --> 40:27.926
