10:00.892 --> 10:02.310
Right!

10:02.352 --> 10:04.354
Comet, you rascal.

10:04.396 --> 10:06.565
[instrumental music]

10:08.525 --> 10:09.734
Come on, daddy.

10:09.776 --> 10:11.945
Oh, Michelle, here we go!

10:11.986 --> 10:14.072
Another major

10:11.986 --> 10:14.072
milestone in your life.

10:14.114 --> 10:15.656
Your first day of pre-school.

10:15.698 --> 10:18.326
- Come on, daddy.

10:15.698 --> 10:18.326
- Don't worry.

10:18.368 --> 10:20.954
You're gonna have lots of

10:18.368 --> 10:20.954
fun and make new friends.

10:20.995 --> 10:23.415
Come on, daddy.

10:23.457 --> 10:27.210
You know, I'll never forget

10:23.457 --> 10:27.210
my first day at pre-school.

10:27.252 --> 10:28.378
Bye, daddy.

10:28.420 --> 10:30.838
Oh, Michelle, honey,

10:28.420 --> 10:30.838
wait for me.

10:30.880 --> 10:32.215
[rattling]

10:32.257 --> 10:33.425
Hi, Miss Petrie.

10:33.467 --> 10:35.510
Hello, Mr. Tanner.

10:35.552 --> 10:38.179
Michelle, I'd like you to meet

10:35.552 --> 10:38.179
your teacher, Miss Petrie.

10:38.221 --> 10:40.723
Well, hi, there.

10:38.221 --> 10:40.723
Nice to meet you.

10:40.765 --> 10:43.435
Nice to meet you too.

10:43.477 --> 10:44.811
Boys and girls

10:44.852 --> 10:47.814
let's say hi to our

10:44.852 --> 10:47.814
new friend, Michelle.

10:47.855 --> 10:50.108
(together)

10:47.855 --> 10:50.108
Hi, Michelle.

10:50.150 --> 10:51.901
Hi, people.

10:53.653 --> 10:55.238
I'm the king.

10:56.739 --> 10:58.825
Michelle, this is Aaron.

10:58.866 --> 11:00.660
Aaron gets to wear

10:58.866 --> 11:00.660
the sharing crown

11:00.701 --> 11:02.954
because he shared

11:00.701 --> 11:02.954
his toys today.

11:02.996 --> 11:04.289
Want to see Dave?

11:04.331 --> 11:07.292
- Okay, who's Dave?

11:04.331 --> 11:07.292
- The birdie.

11:07.334 --> 11:10.086
Dave is our class pet.

11:07.334 --> 11:10.086
He's right over there.

11:10.128 --> 11:11.379
Go say hello.

11:11.421 --> 11:13.507
[indistinct chatter]

11:16.968 --> 11:19.387
Well, I guess I'll

11:16.968 --> 11:19.387
just hang out here today.

11:19.429 --> 11:22.681
Well, Michelle seems to

11:19.429 --> 11:22.681
be adjusting very quickly.

11:22.723 --> 11:24.518
But if it would make you

11:22.723 --> 11:24.518
feel better, you're welcome

11:24.559 --> 11:26.853
to stay and have juice

11:24.559 --> 11:26.853
and cookies with us.

11:26.894 --> 11:28.146
[laughing]

11:28.188 --> 11:30.357
I'll check with Michelle.

11:30.398 --> 11:32.691
Michelle, honey..

11:32.733 --> 11:34.986
...do you want daddy

11:32.733 --> 11:34.986
to stay here with you today?

11:35.028 --> 11:37.822
Go home. I'm a big girl.

11:40.033 --> 11:41.909
Okay, then, I'm gonna

11:40.033 --> 11:41.909
come and pick you up

11:41.951 --> 11:43.370
as soon as school's over, okay?

11:43.411 --> 11:44.912
- Okay.

11:46.623 --> 11:48.542
Drive safely.

11:48.583 --> 11:50.460
Thanks, honey.

11:50.502 --> 11:52.795
So, uh, what do I do now?

11:52.837 --> 11:54.506
I cleared my whole day for this.

11:54.548 --> 11:56.841
Oh, that's not really

11:54.548 --> 11:56.841
your problem, is it?

11:56.883 --> 11:59.052
We'll see you in

11:56.883 --> 11:59.052
a couple of hours, Mr. Tanner.

11:59.093 --> 12:00.970
- Thanks.

11:59.093 --> 12:00.970
- Hm-mm.

12:01.012 --> 12:02.138
I know.

12:02.180 --> 12:03.722
I can wax the kitchen floor.

12:03.764 --> 12:06.226
[chuckles]

12:03.764 --> 12:06.226
Alright!

12:06.267 --> 12:07.894
Yeah.

12:07.935 --> 12:09.937
Okay, boys and girls

12:09.979 --> 12:13.400
let's meet on the magic

12:09.979 --> 12:13.400
carpet for story time.

12:13.441 --> 12:14.526
Come on.

12:14.568 --> 12:16.361
Alright, everybody.

12:16.403 --> 12:19.656
Hi, Dave, you're

12:16.403 --> 12:19.656
a pretty birdie.

12:19.698 --> 12:21.740
Ready for a story,

12:19.698 --> 12:21.740
boys and girls?

12:21.782 --> 12:23.326
(together)

12:21.782 --> 12:23.326
Yeah.

12:23.368 --> 12:25.579
Come on, it's story time.

12:32.293 --> 12:33.712
Petrie.

12:33.752 --> 12:35.714
Dave flew out the window.

12:35.754 --> 12:38.132
Michelle did it.

12:39.509 --> 12:41.344
Well, it was just an accident.

12:41.386 --> 12:44.556
I'm sure Michelle

12:41.386 --> 12:44.556
didn't mean to do it.

12:44.598 --> 12:47.559
I'm sorry. I'm a bad girl.

12:48.809 --> 12:52.439
A very bad girl.

12:52.480 --> 12:54.815
I'm a very bad girl.

12:55.609 --> 12:57.652
[dramatic music]

13:05.744 --> 13:08.246
Dave, come back. Where are you?

13:12.292 --> 13:14.835
Yo, Dave, if you're

13:12.292 --> 13:14.835
out there, come back.

13:14.877 --> 13:16.463
Give the kid a break, huh?

13:18.339 --> 13:20.967
Guys, you should have seen

13:18.339 --> 13:20.967
Michelle in pre-school today.

13:21.008 --> 13:22.469
None of the kids

13:21.008 --> 13:22.469
would play with her.

13:22.510 --> 13:24.053
She sat in a corner by herself

13:24.095 --> 13:26.139
saying, "I'm a bad girl."

13:27.014 --> 13:28.642
(together)

13:27.014 --> 13:28.642
Dave!

13:29.601 --> 13:32.937
Dave, the bread is yummy.

13:32.979 --> 13:34.939
Guys, we gotta

13:32.979 --> 13:34.939
do something here.

13:34.981 --> 13:36.357
Jessie, come with me.

13:36.399 --> 13:37.525
Joey..

13:37.567 --> 13:39.068
...please pick up this bread.

13:45.158 --> 13:47.243
[imitating seagull calling]

13:50.121 --> 13:52.123
There! That should hold it.

13:54.751 --> 13:56.043
[grunts]

13:56.085 --> 13:58.837
Uh-oh!

13:58.879 --> 14:01.882
They should put

13:58.879 --> 14:01.882
a warning on this glue.

14:01.924 --> 14:03.926
Oh, they did.

14:05.720 --> 14:07.221
Hey, Steff, what's going on?

14:07.263 --> 14:08.807
Oh, nothing. Nothing at all.

14:08.847 --> 14:13.102
Just another day doing

14:08.847 --> 14:13.102
nothing here in my room.

14:13.144 --> 14:16.939
You know, I was thinking, we

14:13.144 --> 14:16.939
never hang out like we used to.

14:16.981 --> 14:18.857
So, you wanna go

14:16.981 --> 14:18.857
to the mall with me?

14:18.899 --> 14:20.527
This is cool! This is rad!

14:20.568 --> 14:22.236
This is..

14:22.278 --> 14:25.490
...a real bad time.

14:25.532 --> 14:27.659
I am bushed!

14:31.454 --> 14:32.831
Hi, girls, I'm taking Michelle

14:32.872 --> 14:34.415
for some ice-cream.

14:32.872 --> 14:34.415
Who wants to come?

14:34.457 --> 14:36.501
I do..

14:36.543 --> 14:38.878
...not.

14:38.919 --> 14:41.297
Thanks, Joey, but

14:38.919 --> 14:41.297
I'm going to the mall.

14:41.339 --> 14:43.758
She's acting very strange.

14:45.885 --> 14:47.428
Even for her.

14:50.097 --> 14:52.809
Steff, what are you

14:50.097 --> 14:52.809
hiding under the pillow?

14:52.851 --> 14:56.229
Nothing. See, nothing at all.

14:56.270 --> 14:58.147
Nothing.

14:58.189 --> 15:01.693
Hey, how'd this get here?

15:01.735 --> 15:03.444
Steff, give me D.J.'s diary.

15:06.656 --> 15:08.282
[sniggering]

15:08.324 --> 15:10.326
[laughs]

15:15.122 --> 15:16.416
[sniggering]

15:16.457 --> 15:18.459
[laughs]

15:18.501 --> 15:20.211
You're in big trouble.

15:22.422 --> 15:24.340
Go find Dave. Fly away.

15:27.093 --> 15:28.969
You're no help.

15:29.011 --> 15:30.430
Guess what, Michelle?

15:30.471 --> 15:32.306
Got you a new birdie friend.

15:34.016 --> 15:36.269
That is not Dave.

15:36.310 --> 15:38.605
This is Sammy.

15:38.646 --> 15:40.648
Say hi to Sammy.

15:40.690 --> 15:42.901
Hi, Sammy. Where is Dave?

15:42.942 --> 15:46.195
Michelle, all the kids

15:42.942 --> 15:46.195
are going to love Sammy

15:46.237 --> 15:47.988
when you bring him

15:46.237 --> 15:47.988
to pre-school tomorrow.

15:48.030 --> 15:51.075
I'm not going to pre-school.

15:51.117 --> 15:52.827
Oh, yes, you are, honey.

15:52.869 --> 15:56.330
No way, Jose.

15:52.869 --> 15:56.330
No one likes me.

15:58.875 --> 16:00.501
Oh-ho-ho-ho!

16:00.543 --> 16:03.087
Hold it there, ankle-biter.

16:03.129 --> 16:06.215
Now, we love you

16:03.129 --> 16:06.215
very very much.

16:06.257 --> 16:07.717
And if you don't

16:06.257 --> 16:07.717
wanna go to pre-school

16:07.759 --> 16:10.094
then you don't have to

16:07.759 --> 16:10.094
go to pre-school, okay?

16:10.136 --> 16:12.346
Yay! Thank you.

16:13.848 --> 16:16.016
Alright. There you go!

16:16.058 --> 16:17.852
- No more school.

16:16.058 --> 16:17.852
- Daniel, problem solved.

16:20.688 --> 16:21.898
No.

16:21.940 --> 16:23.775
Problem made worse.

16:23.817 --> 16:26.319
Jessie, Michelle

16:23.817 --> 16:26.319
has to go to pre-school.

16:26.360 --> 16:28.822
How can you send her back to

16:26.360 --> 16:28.822
school? The kids don't like her.

16:28.863 --> 16:31.365
Look, I know you just wanna

16:28.863 --> 16:31.365
protect her from being hurt.

16:31.407 --> 16:33.326
But we can't be by

16:31.407 --> 16:33.326
her side 24 hours a day

16:33.367 --> 16:36.120
just to stop every bad

16:33.367 --> 16:36.120
thing that might happen.

16:36.162 --> 16:38.122
We have to help her

16:36.162 --> 16:38.122
get through this.

16:38.164 --> 16:39.582
Not run away from it.

16:39.624 --> 16:41.208
Look, I know what

16:39.624 --> 16:41.208
the kid's going through.

16:41.250 --> 16:44.420
In kindergarten, I was

16:41.250 --> 16:44.420
the goldfish monitor.

16:44.462 --> 16:46.756
A part of my job was to take the

16:44.462 --> 16:46.756
goldfish home for the weekend.

16:46.798 --> 16:48.382
I learned

16:46.798 --> 16:48.382
a very important lesson.

16:48.424 --> 16:51.135
When taking a goldfish home,

16:48.424 --> 16:51.135
take the bowl with you.

16:53.095 --> 16:55.181
You killed

16:53.095 --> 16:55.181
the kindergarten goldfish?

16:55.222 --> 16:58.225
Hey, back off, man.

16:55.222 --> 16:58.225
I'm still trying to get over it.

16:58.267 --> 17:01.395
To this day

16:58.267 --> 17:01.395
I can't eat sushi.

17:01.437 --> 17:02.689
So, what happened?

17:02.730 --> 17:04.440
Well, my parents made

17:02.730 --> 17:04.440
me go back to school

17:04.482 --> 17:05.733
and all the kids teased me.

17:05.775 --> 17:08.486
They called me fish hater.

17:08.528 --> 17:10.655
Ooh, brutal!

17:10.697 --> 17:11.948
For how long did this go on?

17:11.990 --> 17:13.616
Well...you know

17:13.658 --> 17:15.994
actually, it went

17:13.658 --> 17:15.994
on till show and tell.

17:16.035 --> 17:17.036
Oh, yeah.

17:17.077 --> 17:18.078
Luckily, Barry Fox brought in

17:18.120 --> 17:19.121
his toenail collection

17:19.163 --> 17:20.874
all the kids turned on him.

17:23.584 --> 17:26.587
I suppose you were

17:23.584 --> 17:26.587
right and I was wrong.

17:26.629 --> 17:29.007
Okay, she should

17:26.629 --> 17:29.007
go back to school.

17:29.048 --> 17:32.134
And who better to tell her

17:29.048 --> 17:32.134
than the man that was right.

17:32.176 --> 17:33.887
Congratulations, daddy.

17:35.429 --> 17:36.681
Thanks.

17:38.057 --> 17:40.810
Thanks, Joey, you saved my life.

17:40.852 --> 17:42.436
Now, Steff, when you break

17:40.852 --> 17:42.436
the next thing you're not

17:42.478 --> 17:43.938
supposed to be touching,

17:42.478 --> 17:43.938
be very careful

17:43.980 --> 17:45.773
with this permanent

17:43.980 --> 17:45.773
glue because as you..

17:45.815 --> 17:48.776
...know, this could happen.

17:51.988 --> 17:56.158
Joey, what are you

17:51.988 --> 17:56.158
doing with my diary?

17:56.200 --> 17:57.535
Ouch!

17:58.703 --> 18:01.330
Well, nice seeing you all again.

18:01.372 --> 18:03.457
Uh, Steff, isn't there

18:01.372 --> 18:03.457
something you would like

18:03.499 --> 18:06.293
to say to D.J. about her diary?

18:06.335 --> 18:08.629
Yes. There is.

18:08.671 --> 18:11.966
D.J., Joey did not

18:08.671 --> 18:11.966
steal your diary.

18:12.008 --> 18:14.260
Michelle did.

18:14.301 --> 18:16.054
[clearing throat]

18:16.095 --> 18:17.889
Maybe it was me.

18:17.931 --> 18:19.933
You know how I am with names.

18:19.974 --> 18:23.310
Joey, may I have a word

18:19.974 --> 18:23.310
alone with my nosey sister?

18:23.352 --> 18:25.855
- Sure.

18:23.352 --> 18:25.855
- Joey, don't go!

18:25.897 --> 18:27.815
Steff, I have to go.

18:31.861 --> 18:34.321
I really wish

18:31.861 --> 18:34.321
I hadn't done that.

18:35.949 --> 18:37.951
Sit.

18:37.992 --> 18:39.577
I'm not gonna yell at you.

18:39.619 --> 18:41.120
I'm just gonna talk in a very

18:41.161 --> 18:44.749
firm voice for a very long time.

18:44.791 --> 18:48.419
Now, why are you always

18:44.791 --> 18:48.419
snooping around in my stuff?

18:48.461 --> 18:50.004
I can't help it.

18:50.046 --> 18:51.714
You fascinate me!

18:51.756 --> 18:53.758
Listen, you have

18:51.756 --> 18:53.758
no business to..

18:55.760 --> 18:58.178
I fascinate you?

18:58.220 --> 19:01.140
Of course, you do.

18:58.220 --> 19:01.140
You go to school dances.

19:01.181 --> 19:03.851
You have seven different

19:01.181 --> 19:03.851
teachers in the same day

19:03.893 --> 19:05.812
and you carry a purse.

19:05.853 --> 19:07.688
You're a woman of the world.

19:09.732 --> 19:13.277
True. But I still

19:09.732 --> 19:13.277
need my privacy.

19:14.528 --> 19:15.947
I'll tell you what.

19:15.989 --> 19:17.824
If you really promise

19:17.865 --> 19:20.326
that my diary is off limits

19:20.367 --> 19:24.288
I'll try to tell you more

19:20.367 --> 19:24.288
about my fascinating life.

19:24.330 --> 19:26.373
I promise.

19:26.415 --> 19:28.042
Forgive me.

19:28.084 --> 19:30.461
I guess so.

19:30.503 --> 19:33.798
Besides, I keep my really

19:30.503 --> 19:33.798
hot stories in my journal.

19:35.215 --> 19:37.927
You have a journal?

19:37.969 --> 19:41.055
Where is it?

19:37.969 --> 19:41.055
What does it look like?

19:41.097 --> 19:42.640
Okay, Michelle,

19:41.097 --> 19:42.640
you wait right here.

19:42.682 --> 19:44.684
I'm gonna talk to

19:42.682 --> 19:44.684
the other boys and girls.

19:44.725 --> 19:48.354
You stay with me all day.

19:48.395 --> 19:51.440
I promise. I won't leave

19:48.395 --> 19:51.440
unless you say it's alright.

19:51.482 --> 19:54.902
- Thank you very much.

19:51.482 --> 19:54.902
- You're welcome.

19:54.944 --> 19:56.696
Now, you stay right here

19:56.737 --> 19:58.072
where I can see you.

19:59.949 --> 20:01.784
- Hi, Miss Petrie.

19:59.949 --> 20:01.784
- Oh, hello, Mr. Tanner.

20:01.826 --> 20:03.077
Boys and girls

20:03.119 --> 20:05.538
Michelle's daddy

20:03.119 --> 20:05.538
wants to talk to you.

20:06.914 --> 20:09.458
- They're all ears.

20:06.914 --> 20:09.458
- Thanks.

20:09.500 --> 20:12.086
- Hi, kids.

20:09.500 --> 20:12.086
- Hi.

20:12.128 --> 20:13.671
I'm Danny Tanner.

20:13.713 --> 20:16.215
I have my own talk show,

20:13.713 --> 20:16.215
"Wake Up, San Francisco."

20:18.176 --> 20:20.553
Oh, well, we're on

20:18.176 --> 20:20.553
opposite Sesame Street

20:20.594 --> 20:22.638
so I guess that's why

20:20.594 --> 20:22.638
you're all so impressed.

20:24.140 --> 20:26.225
My sweet little girl Michelle

20:26.266 --> 20:29.269
has brought someone for you

20:26.266 --> 20:29.269
to keep here at the pre-school

20:29.311 --> 20:32.272
because she likes

20:29.311 --> 20:32.272
you all so very much.

20:32.314 --> 20:33.900
Come on in, Michelle.

20:35.068 --> 20:38.029
(together)

20:35.068 --> 20:38.029
Ooh, a birdie!

20:38.071 --> 20:40.322
Now, talk to the boys and girls.

20:40.364 --> 20:43.534
This is Sammy here

20:40.364 --> 20:43.534
and he's a nice birdie.

20:44.702 --> 20:46.620
I give him to the pre-school.

20:46.662 --> 20:49.874
Michelle, that's very generous.

20:49.916 --> 20:52.835
Why don't we thank Michelle

20:49.916 --> 20:52.835
by clapping our hands.

20:52.877 --> 20:56.380
(together)

20:52.877 --> 20:56.380
Thank you, Michelle.

20:56.422 --> 21:00.718
See, honey, all your new friends

20:56.422 --> 21:00.718
are saying thank you very much.

21:00.760 --> 21:03.179
Welcome very much.

21:03.221 --> 21:06.599
Everyone, come say

21:03.221 --> 21:06.599
hi to our new birdie.

21:09.518 --> 21:13.355
Here, Michelle, you can

21:09.518 --> 21:13.355
wear the sharing crown.

21:14.982 --> 21:16.692
Thank you.

21:20.029 --> 21:23.032
Daddy, I'm a princess.

21:23.074 --> 21:26.244
Yes, you are, Michelle.

21:23.074 --> 21:26.244
You are my little princess.

21:26.285 --> 21:28.829
Sweetheart, I'm very proud

21:26.285 --> 21:28.829
of you for being so brave

21:28.871 --> 21:30.623
and coming to pre-school.

21:30.664 --> 21:32.416
Do you want me to

21:30.664 --> 21:32.416
stay here with you?

21:32.458 --> 21:34.752
No, thank you.

21:32.458 --> 21:34.752
They like me now.

21:36.879 --> 21:40.174
I think you're gonna have a real

21:36.879 --> 21:40.174
good time here in pre-school.

21:40.216 --> 21:42.718
I like being a big girl.

21:46.680 --> 21:48.975
Go play with your

21:46.680 --> 21:48.975
new friends now, honey.

21:51.978 --> 21:53.687
You okay?

21:53.729 --> 21:56.941
Yeah. I'll be fine.

21:56.983 --> 21:59.401
But if she's ever

21:56.983 --> 21:59.401
crowned Miss America

21:59.443 --> 22:01.570
I'll be crying like a baby.
