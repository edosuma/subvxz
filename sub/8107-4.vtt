00:02.128 --> 00:03.755
There were some
nice guys there,

00:03.880 --> 00:10.136
but they're all so quiet,
awkward smiles and sweaty palms.

00:10.261 --> 00:13.223
I'm not expecting Brad Pitt
to walk into St. Theresa's,

00:13.348 --> 00:18.895
just someone who makes me laugh,
has a nice smile, full head of hair.

00:19.729 --> 00:23.316
You know, someone like you,
Mr. Franklin.

00:25.735 --> 00:28.738
It's a shame they're
going to cremate you.

00:49.884 --> 00:51.177
(GASPS)

00:55.849 --> 00:57.350
Can I help you?

00:59.436 --> 01:00.812
Martin!

01:06.526 --> 01:07.736
Martin!

01:09.738 --> 01:12.741
My purse is right there.
Go ahead, take whatever you want.

01:51.029 --> 01:52.322
Irene!

02:38.660 --> 02:40.036
How are you doing?

02:40.161 --> 02:41.246
I'm fine.

02:42.497 --> 02:46.751
FYI, if you ask me,
it's more the guys' fault than yours.

02:46.876 --> 02:48.878
And House isn't
blameless, either.

02:49.003 --> 02:50.672
If he hadn't pitted us all
against each other...

02:50.797 --> 02:53.091
It was my fault.
My mistake.

02:56.094 --> 02:58.263
(PHONE RINGING)

03:01.349 --> 03:03.434
Was that always there?

03:05.770 --> 03:06.604
Hello?

03:07.480 --> 03:08.606
Sure.

03:09.023 --> 03:10.859
It's House.

03:10.984 --> 03:13.027
<i>HOUSE: Good morning, angels.</i>

03:13.152 --> 03:16.573
<i>As you will see from the file,
we have quite the interesting case.</i>

03:16.698 --> 03:19.993
<i>It's not often you get a patient
who sees dead people.</i>

03:20.118 --> 03:21.327
What file?

03:22.829 --> 03:23.872
What the hell?

03:23.997 --> 03:25.540
I gave it to Bosley
a half-hour ago.

03:25.665 --> 03:27.500
It was not a half-hour,
it was 10 minutes.

03:27.625 --> 03:30.628
And he made copies
of the ER records first.

03:32.213 --> 03:34.090
Less lip, more whip.

03:34.215 --> 03:35.341
I only agreed
to take this case

03:35.466 --> 03:38.595
because you said that this mocha
frapalicious would have whip on it.

03:38.720 --> 03:40.597
Fine. I'll refer
the case to Foreman.

03:40.722 --> 03:42.932
Can't. Mercy fired him.

03:43.057 --> 03:44.183
- Gimme.
- He got fired?

03:44.309 --> 03:47.520
He disobeyed a superior officer under
fire. He's lucky he wasn't executed.

03:47.645 --> 03:49.606
How do you know about it?
You keeping tabs on him?

03:49.731 --> 03:51.441
Girls talk.

03:52.275 --> 03:54.694
When Bosley drags
his ancient ass in there...

03:54.819 --> 03:56.654
I'm here.

03:56.779 --> 04:01.784
Twenty-four year old funeral cosmetician
suffered a grand mal seizure at work.

04:01.910 --> 04:03.119
(WHISPERING)
Why does he get to be Bosley?

04:03.244 --> 04:04.078
(WHISPERING) You want to be Bosley?

04:04.203 --> 04:06.122
Bosley's, like,
the asexual messenger boy.

04:06.247 --> 04:10.084
She had a vision of being raped
by a cadaver before passing out.

04:10.209 --> 04:12.545
Seizure rules out
psychiatric illness.

04:12.670 --> 04:15.256
No history of epilepsy,
head trauma or drug use.

04:15.381 --> 04:18.217
Bosley keeps his job while they replace
five angels over three seasons.

04:18.343 --> 04:19.886
Could be a tumor
to the temporal lobe.

04:20.011 --> 04:21.220
Not with a normal CT scan.

04:21.346 --> 04:23.306
You mean, it appeared normal
to the doc in the ER.

04:23.431 --> 04:25.683
Way to get right back
on that horse, Thirteen.

04:25.808 --> 04:26.643
No, that was Amber.

04:26.768 --> 04:28.770
<i>HOUSE: Nice try,
Cutthroat Bitch.</i>

04:28.895 --> 04:31.481
<i>That was the worst Thirteen imitation
I've ever heard.</i>

04:31.606 --> 04:34.067
Funeral home prep rooms
are filled with toxic chemicals.

04:34.192 --> 04:37.070
And cadavers. Everybody in that place
obviously died from something.

04:37.195 --> 04:39.572
I have a question.
Is he the one who's not a doctor?

04:39.697 --> 04:42.200
Bullets aren't contagious,
but infections, parasites...

04:42.325 --> 04:46.329
You said one of us wasn't a doctor,
and you called him a fraud.

04:46.454 --> 04:49.290
<i>HOUSE: He's not a doctor.
Continue, Bos.</i>

04:49.874 --> 04:50.708
Could be an STD.

04:50.833 --> 04:52.126
Why isn't he fired?

04:52.251 --> 04:53.962
(HITTING BUTTONS ON PHONE)
You're breaking up.

04:54.087 --> 04:55.505
<i>Going into a tunnel.</i>

04:55.630 --> 04:58.257
Dark Religious Nut.

04:58.383 --> 04:59.509
What did you call me?

04:59.634 --> 05:00.468
<i>HOUSE: I'm sorry.</i>

05:00.593 --> 05:02.720
<i>What do you people
want to be called this week?</i>

05:02.845 --> 05:03.763
Cole.

05:03.888 --> 05:05.682
No, I'm never gonna
remember that.

05:05.807 --> 05:08.810
<i>Take Bosley and the other
visible minority to the funeral home.</i>

05:08.935 --> 05:11.562
<i>The rest of you young, white people,
the world is your oyster.</i>

05:11.688 --> 05:15.191
<i>Do an MRI with contrast,
EEG, LP and a blood panel.</i>

05:15.316 --> 05:17.944
And, angels, be careful.

05:21.030 --> 05:24.826
Just because he's religious,
doesn't mean he won't kick your ass.

05:24.951 --> 05:26.119
- You want to bet?
- No.

05:26.244 --> 05:29.414
I want you to stop being
such a jerk to him.

05:32.750 --> 05:34.460
$100.

05:36.546 --> 05:38.923
Smart call. The guy's a wuss.

05:39.048 --> 05:40.800
He'll be the next one
on the train.

05:40.925 --> 05:42.468
Define "kick your ass."

05:42.593 --> 05:44.178
Any physical confrontation?

05:44.303 --> 05:45.263
Or verbal?

05:45.388 --> 05:46.222
Define verbal.

05:46.347 --> 05:48.891
Anything over 70 decibels.

05:49.017 --> 05:51.144
And you can't start
suddenly being nice to him.

05:51.269 --> 05:52.854
You realize what you're
encouraging here.

05:52.979 --> 05:55.356
Yeah. Someone kicking your ass.

06:00.319 --> 06:02.697
The space inside
is smaller than I thought.

06:02.822 --> 06:04.115
Don't worry, Reena.

06:04.240 --> 06:06.701
The doctors are gonna
take good care of you, right?

06:06.826 --> 06:08.786
Once the Valium kicks in
you'll feel better.

06:08.911 --> 06:12.123
And then we'll have
some nice, warm milk when you're done.

06:12.248 --> 06:13.583
I'd rather have more Valium.

06:13.708 --> 06:14.625
(CHUCKLING) Oh, Reena!

06:14.751 --> 06:17.045
Let's wait just a bit,
see how it goes.

06:17.170 --> 06:19.422
Try to lie as still
as possible.

06:23.217 --> 06:25.553
Guess Father Time's
a lock for one of the spots.

06:25.678 --> 06:27.096
Thirteen's a lock.

06:27.221 --> 06:29.474
He doesn't have a medical license
and he's still around.

06:29.599 --> 06:33.019
She killed a guy
in a wheelchair and his dog.

06:33.144 --> 06:36.314
He doesn't care about
our qualifications, our ideas,

06:36.439 --> 06:38.107
he just wants to have fun.

06:38.232 --> 06:41.110
And she's the ultimate fun,
because he can't figure her out.

06:41.235 --> 06:42.695
This game is insane.

06:42.820 --> 06:44.989
So quit. Happy to
lose the competition.

06:45.114 --> 06:45.948
(SIGHS)

06:46.074 --> 06:49.911
If it's gonna be on your résumé, it's
got to be better to quit than get fired.

06:50.036 --> 06:52.163
Either quit or shut up.

06:55.041 --> 06:58.836
Actually, with House,
getting fired might look better.

07:00.880 --> 07:04.300
Dr. House
is a dangerous egomaniac.

07:04.425 --> 07:08.346
That's why I left. We had
different ideas on how to practice.

07:08.471 --> 07:11.265
Glad to hear it.
Tell me about Mercy.

07:11.390 --> 07:14.393
To be honest, I don't think
Dr. Schaffer really gave me a chance.

07:14.519 --> 07:16.187
Obviously not.
You were there for three weeks.

07:16.312 --> 07:18.064
What happened?

07:18.189 --> 07:19.649
I saved a patient's life.

07:19.774 --> 07:23.069
That's usually not
grounds for dismissal.

07:23.194 --> 07:24.403
Have you spoken to her?

07:24.529 --> 07:25.947
Yes.

07:26.072 --> 07:27.532
Then why are you asking me
what happened?

07:27.657 --> 07:29.200
You have an
excellent résumé.

07:29.325 --> 07:32.203
I felt I owed it to you
to hear what you had to say.

07:32.328 --> 07:33.287
What did she tell you?

07:33.412 --> 07:37.250
That you defied her instructions
and hospital procedures.

07:37.375 --> 07:41.379
That's what happened,
nothing more I can add to that.

07:41.504 --> 07:44.173
You could tell me
that you were wrong.

07:46.217 --> 07:49.720
Sounds like you didn't
leave House quite soon enough.

07:52.473 --> 07:54.350

so is her food.</i>

07:54.475 --> 07:58.187

that he's an idiot.</i>

Bosley?

08:08.990 --> 08:12.994
<i>Either tell him he's an idiot,
or tell me why I'm wrong.</i>

08:13.119 --> 08:14.078
You're an idiot.

08:14.203 --> 08:16.289
You actually think
that I'd take a patient

08:16.414 --> 08:19.667
who had a seizure in a funeral home,
if the ER hadn't already ruled out

08:19.792 --> 08:21.586
- embalming fluid?
- I thought we weren't supposed to...

08:21.711 --> 08:22.628
<i>HOUSE: Idiot!</i>

08:22.753 --> 08:25.298
From the old French, idiots,

08:25.423 --> 08:28.467
meaning effeminate,
mentally deficient Moor.

08:29.886 --> 08:32.847
HENRY: I found something
in the mortuary's files from '05.

08:32.972 --> 08:36.601
A 48-year-old male's cause of death
was listed as pneumonia,

08:36.726 --> 08:39.103
but the symptoms
in the autopsy report didn't fit.

08:39.228 --> 08:42.148
<i>Confusion, memory loss,
depression...</i>

08:42.273 --> 08:44.275
Mad cow. Very cool.

08:44.400 --> 08:48.196
No, she's a vegetarian and only
ate organic vegetables, at that.

08:48.321 --> 08:50.531
Tell him he's an idiot again.

08:50.656 --> 08:52.742
The disease can be
spread by brain tissue.

08:52.867 --> 08:54.869
Which is very cool.
Run with it.

08:54.994 --> 08:57.246
So, because the answer
might be cool,

08:57.371 --> 09:00.124
you want us to do a brain biopsy
on a 24-year-old woman?

09:00.249 --> 09:02.376
No, because the answer
is something cool,

09:02.501 --> 09:07.298
I want you to do a brain biopsy
on a 48-year-old dead guy.

09:07.423 --> 09:09.050
The guy's already been buried.

09:09.175 --> 09:10.092
We dig him up.

09:10.218 --> 09:12.678
I'm not digging up a body
without a court order.

09:12.803 --> 09:14.430
<i>HOUSE: Don't think of it as
digging up a body.</i>

09:14.555 --> 09:18.726
Think of it as keeping
another one from being buried.

09:19.644 --> 09:21.062
I can't do it.

09:22.063 --> 09:24.482
Are we gonna have another one
of those ecumenical discussions

09:24.607 --> 09:28.110
<i>where I tell you that your beliefs
are ridiculous and you totally cave?</i>

09:28.236 --> 09:30.196
I just got to be home at 6:00.

09:30.321 --> 09:31.364
The Sabbath.

09:31.489 --> 09:35.117
The Lord works for six days,
then tells the union he needs a rest.

09:35.243 --> 09:38.079
You know, if I was all-powerful
I think I'd take at least two days.

09:38.204 --> 09:39.413
It's Thursday.

10:03.771 --> 10:05.314
Where's the single mom?

10:07.108 --> 10:09.402
I have no idea.

10:09.527 --> 10:10.695
<i>HOUSE: Interesting.</i>

10:10.820 --> 10:13.072
You claim a lapse of judgment,

10:13.197 --> 10:16.117
or are you gonna admit that
a lapse in judgment is a lapse in faith?

10:16.242 --> 10:18.077
He's gone.

Dr. Cuddy? I'm Amber Volakis,
one of Dr. House's new fellows.

Sexual harassment claims
go through HR,

10:36.137 --> 10:38.014
stress-related leaves
through workers comp,

10:38.139 --> 10:40.224
and any accusations
of criminal activities

10:40.349 --> 10:43.436
go directly to the
Princeton-Plainsboro police department.

10:43.561 --> 10:48.107
Actually, I was wondering if you needed
any extra help in the clinic tonight.

10:49.608 --> 10:52.069
You're not gonna score any points
with House by kissing my ass.

10:52.194 --> 10:55.031
Understood, but I hear
Dr. House hates clinic duty.

10:55.156 --> 10:56.490
If he were to hear through the grapevine

10:56.615 --> 10:58.534
that I was willing to work overtime,
take some of it off his hands...

10:58.659 --> 11:01.579
My advice to you is to do
whatever House wants you to do tonight.

11:01.704 --> 11:03.205
And then tomorrow night
you can come back

11:03.331 --> 11:05.333
and I will give you
extra clinic duty.

11:05.458 --> 11:08.544
Does everybody around here
have trust issues?

11:09.211 --> 11:11.839
I don't know what House wants you to do
and I don't want to know.

11:11.964 --> 11:14.008
But if you really have
a problem with it, quit now.

11:14.133 --> 11:16.302
It's only gonna get worse.

11:26.395 --> 11:27.480
All right. Who's up?

11:27.605 --> 11:28.773
Not me.

11:28.898 --> 11:30.232
You haven't done
any digging yet.

11:30.358 --> 11:31.192
I'm a surgeon.

11:31.317 --> 11:33.319
If anything happens to these hands,
I'm screwed.

11:33.444 --> 11:34.320
Let Bosley do it.

11:34.445 --> 11:35.821
As long as he can keep
folding laundry,

11:35.988 --> 11:37.448
his career...

Where the hell
have you been?

I got lost.

12:00.638 --> 12:02.723
We've been here
over three hours.

12:02.848 --> 12:04.725
Really lost.

12:04.850 --> 12:06.852
I brought coffee and donuts.

12:11.399 --> 12:13.609
So, Thirteen,
you grow up around here?

12:15.111 --> 12:16.946
We're digging up a grave
and you want to chit-chat?

12:17.071 --> 12:20.616
I'm just making conversation.
It's what people do.

12:20.741 --> 12:22.576
Why are you
hiding everything?

12:22.701 --> 12:26.497
And I'm asking you that question
because you're hiding everything.

12:26.622 --> 12:29.458
There's something
seriously wrong with you.

12:29.583 --> 12:31.210
I'm worried.

12:31.335 --> 12:32.628
No, you're not.

12:32.753 --> 12:36.090
Fine, but I am freaked,
because I don't think you're a freak.

12:36.215 --> 12:37.466
I think you're doing this on purpose

12:37.591 --> 12:39.301
because you know
House will be intrigued.

12:41.679 --> 12:43.722
Yeah, I grew up around here.

12:49.353 --> 12:51.939
Honey, I'm home.

12:53.190 --> 12:54.358
Get the crowbar.

12:54.483 --> 12:57.111
No, there's not enough room
to maneuver a crowbar down here.

12:57.236 --> 12:58.195
(GRUNTS)

12:58.320 --> 13:00.448
Oh, God help us.

13:05.327 --> 13:06.328
What the hell?

13:06.454 --> 13:07.455
What is it?

13:07.580 --> 13:11.041
Ankles. They buried the guy
the wrong way around.

13:17.631 --> 13:20.176
The doctors' lounge
is covered in mud.

13:20.301 --> 13:22.887
Thirteen and Cutthroat Bitch
had a disagreement.

13:23.012 --> 13:25.181
Cafeteria was out of Jell-O.

13:25.306 --> 13:26.599
There were pickaxes.

13:26.724 --> 13:30.186
Either you had them dig up a body,
or you're building a rail road.

13:30.311 --> 13:33.022
A little, tiny piece of his brain.
Seemed a waste.

13:33.147 --> 13:34.190
He wasn't using it anymore.

13:34.315 --> 13:35.232
That's your defense?

13:35.357 --> 13:37.318
"We just dismembered him."

13:37.443 --> 13:39.987
They're looking for
Creutzfeldt-Jakob.

13:41.572 --> 13:43.365
You get the results yet?

13:43.491 --> 13:46.410
Does my breath smell
bated to you?

13:46.535 --> 13:49.830
Yes. Let me know
when you hear anything.

13:49.955 --> 13:52.374
And get that mess in
the shower area cleaned up.

13:52.500 --> 13:54.210
I know just the guy.

13:54.335 --> 13:56.754
How many of them
agreed to dig up a grave?

13:56.879 --> 14:00.216
Six. But don't worry, the one
who didn't, didn't stand on principle.

14:00.341 --> 14:02.843
He just had a
diaper to change.

14:02.968 --> 14:06.430
I really think there are
no bad choices in this group.

14:19.902 --> 14:23.447
You guys don't wipe your feet
when you come in the house?

14:23.572 --> 14:25.115
Doctors' lounge, let's go.

14:25.241 --> 14:26.492
Why me?

14:26.617 --> 14:28.744
Well, I can't ask the black guy
or one of the chicks to do it.

14:28.869 --> 14:30.246
That would be insensitive.

14:30.371 --> 14:31.997
And you can't ask Bosley

14:32.122 --> 14:36.794
because that'd look like you only hired
the non-doctor to do non-doctor stuff.

14:36.919 --> 14:39.171
You keep stalling,
you're still gonna clean up,

14:39.296 --> 14:41.757
but I won't let you
have the mop.

14:45.219 --> 14:47.972
Sample came back negative
for Creutzfeldt-Jakob.

14:52.309 --> 14:54.353
Well, that discussion
didn't last long.

14:54.478 --> 14:56.272
BRENNAN: I just don't know
what else there is.

14:56.397 --> 14:59.358
We had an idea, it was wrong.

14:59.483 --> 15:01.193
Well, we could go home.

15:01.318 --> 15:03.320
I mean, we have no idea
what's wrong with her,

15:03.445 --> 15:05.114
which means it could be
completely benign.

15:05.239 --> 15:08.576
Or, on the off chance
that it's killing her,

15:08.701 --> 15:10.995
we could take it again from the top.

15:13.539 --> 15:15.583
You've already
done everything.

15:15.708 --> 15:16.709
We may have missed something.

15:16.834 --> 15:19.378
I just want to go home.
I'm sure I'm fine now.

15:19.503 --> 15:22.381
Reena, the doctors know best.

15:22.506 --> 15:23.799
You had some
serious symptoms...

15:23.924 --> 15:26.719
If I have another one,
I'll come right back. Okay?

15:26.844 --> 15:28.345
If you have it
while you're driving...

15:28.470 --> 15:30.764
You can drive me,
make sure I take it easy.

15:32.933 --> 15:34.268
Who can?

15:35.394 --> 15:36.729
My mother.

15:39.982 --> 15:40.983
Your mother's here?

15:41.108 --> 15:44.194
What are you talking about?
She's right there.

15:56.290 --> 15:58.751
<i>HOUSE ON PHONE: You sampled
every bodily fluid,</i>

15:58.876 --> 16:04.340
<i>peeked in her brain, violated
a cadaver's privacy, dug up a body,</i>

16:05.299 --> 16:06.759
but missed the fact

16:06.884 --> 16:10.471
that she was still seeing
things that weren't there.

16:10.638 --> 16:11.639
(PHONE BEEPS)

16:11.764 --> 16:13.891
Neurological symptoms
are getting worse.

16:14.016 --> 16:17.811
It'd be nice if one of you
angels/morons had a clue why.

16:17.936 --> 16:19.146
We did a full history.

16:19.271 --> 16:22.316
She never mentioned seeing
or hearing anything unusual.

16:22.441 --> 16:25.194
Well, as long as she never
said anything, how were you to know?

16:25.319 --> 16:27.655
Same thing with the spinal fluid?
She tell you that was fine?

16:27.780 --> 16:29.490
The labs were all clear.

16:29.615 --> 16:32.034
Then either we're about
to meet the Alpha and Omega,

16:32.159 --> 16:35.037
or you missed something.

16:35.162 --> 16:36.455
We missed the new symptom.

16:36.580 --> 16:38.832
It's not a new symptom.
We always knew she had hallucinations.

16:38.957 --> 16:41.210
Seeing your dead mother's
a hallucination.

16:41.335 --> 16:44.046
Not knowing she's dead
is a delusion.

16:44.171 --> 16:47.299
You keep this up, you're gonna have
to start wearing sexier clothes.

16:47.424 --> 16:52.137
Carbon monoxide could also cause
delusions. A lot of haunted houses...

16:52.262 --> 16:54.348
There's no headache,
no tachycardia.

16:54.473 --> 16:56.433
I guess they didn't cover that
at your medical school.

16:56.558 --> 16:59.186
What about a hereditary connection?
I mean, she's 24.

16:59.311 --> 17:00.604
Her mother died
when she was 25.

17:00.729 --> 17:03.857
In Ukraine, 20 years ago.
Good luck trying to get those records.

17:03.982 --> 17:05.359
So we start new records.

17:05.484 --> 17:08.028
Test for every hereditary disease
that fits the symptoms.

17:08.153 --> 17:10.447
There are at least 40 different
mitochondrial disorders,

17:10.572 --> 17:11.407
another couple hundred...

17:11.532 --> 17:16.286
Start with amyloidosis and you
keep going until you reach zamyloidosis.

17:20.999 --> 17:23.460
Now what are you testing for?

17:23.585 --> 17:26.171
Or should I ask
what you are not testing for?

17:26.296 --> 17:27.464
Well, we could narrow it down

17:27.589 --> 17:29.091
if you could remember
what your mother died from.

17:29.216 --> 17:32.386
My mother is not dead.
She's sitting right there.

17:33.887 --> 17:35.222
Do you think
we're lying to you?

17:35.347 --> 17:36.890
Leave it alone.

17:41.270 --> 17:44.106
Convincing her that her mother's dead
isn't gonna make her better,

17:44.231 --> 17:46.066
just miserable.

17:46.191 --> 17:48.068
You lose your mother?

17:52.614 --> 17:55.826
Do you think we're trying to trick you?
Why would we do that?

17:55.951 --> 17:59.163
Because you're mean,
and you're not good at your job.

17:59.288 --> 18:01.749
Reena, stop.
You're being cruel.

18:01.874 --> 18:03.459
They're wasting time,

18:03.584 --> 18:06.754
doing exactly what the guy
in the wheelchair said they'd do.

18:09.798 --> 18:10.966
A guy in a wheelchair
was here?

18:11.091 --> 18:12.551
You know who
I'm talking about.

18:12.676 --> 18:15.137
He's been hanging around
ever since they brought me in,

18:15.262 --> 18:18.265
complaining about
how incompetent everyone is.

18:19.308 --> 18:21.018
He said you killed his dog.

18:28.776 --> 18:29.693
CUDDY: It doesn't
make any sense.

18:29.818 --> 18:30.861
FOREMAN: I'm not interested.

18:30.986 --> 18:33.071
CUDDY: If you weren't interested,
you wouldn't be here.

18:33.197 --> 18:34.907
I thought it was social.

18:35.032 --> 18:36.992
No, you didn't.
You always think there's an agenda.

18:37.117 --> 18:38.285
That's why I left.

18:38.410 --> 18:41.205
That's why you're good.

18:41.330 --> 18:43.290
- You need a job.
- I'll find a job.

18:43.415 --> 18:45.876
- I need someone that understands House.
- They'll learn.

18:46.001 --> 18:47.836
I need someone that can control House.

18:47.961 --> 18:49.046
(CHUCKLES)

18:49.546 --> 18:52.174
Keep looking.
It might take a while.

18:54.718 --> 18:57.221
I'll cut the salary
of everyone else on the team 15%,

18:57.346 --> 18:58.639
give it to you.

18:58.764 --> 19:01.600
That's more than you'll
get anywhere else.

19:02.184 --> 19:03.519
What does House
say about this?

19:03.644 --> 19:07.022
You're the one person
on the team that he always respected.

19:07.147 --> 19:07.981
(SCOFFS)

19:08.106 --> 19:11.193
This restaurant is 20 minutes out of
your way, half an hour out of mine.

19:11.318 --> 19:14.613
You picked it to make sure
House didn't drop in on us.

19:14.738 --> 19:16.532
It's my decision, not his.

19:16.657 --> 19:20.244
You tell him that, then run back to your
office while I get to deal with him.

19:20.369 --> 19:21.870
I left for a reason.

19:21.995 --> 19:24.164
That reason hasn't changed.

19:33.715 --> 19:34.758
So,

19:35.259 --> 19:36.677
what's the news?

19:36.802 --> 19:38.762
Everything's negative so far.

19:38.887 --> 19:41.765
Yes. Why wait to finish
before reporting to me?

19:41.890 --> 19:43.141
I have things to do, you know.

19:43.267 --> 19:44.518
She's seeing someone else.

19:44.643 --> 19:48.313
That's not news,
that's olds.

19:48.438 --> 19:51.358
Damn it. Why did God design
the human body this way?

19:51.483 --> 19:52.609
A guy in a wheelchair.

19:52.734 --> 19:55.404
In a hospital? That's enough
to give you the heebie-jeebies.

19:55.529 --> 20:00.284
He had a dog.
She's seeing Stark, our last patient.

20:00.409 --> 20:04.079
Well, if it's Stark,
he wouldn't be haunting a patient,

20:04.204 --> 20:07.833
he'd be haunting the doctor
who killed him.

20:07.958 --> 20:10.002
She probably just overheard
someone talking about it, or...

20:10.127 --> 20:11.128
Probably?

20:11.253 --> 20:13.922
You think there's a possibility
that the alternative is true?

20:14.047 --> 20:15.507
- No.
- Then go away.

20:15.632 --> 20:18.802
We're wasting time. We ran 32 gels,
we could run 100 more.

20:18.927 --> 20:20.137
Without knowing how
her mother died...

20:20.262 --> 20:22.014
You're gonna have
to run 100 more.

20:22.139 --> 20:22.973
By you, of course,

20:23.098 --> 20:25.225
I'm only referring to the people
who care enough about human life

20:25.350 --> 20:27.144
to put in a full day.

20:27.269 --> 20:28.729
You want to carpool?

20:29.479 --> 20:31.565
How do you expect me
to respond to this stuff?

20:31.690 --> 20:33.609
Exactly like you just did.

20:33.734 --> 20:36.194
I have a theory.
Maybe you can help me out.

20:36.320 --> 20:40.782
Black Mormon means masochist,
means kinky.

20:41.825 --> 20:45.329
I'm thinking that someone got hurt
making the bastard. Am I right?

20:45.454 --> 20:46.455
You leave my son
out of this.

20:46.580 --> 20:49.833
I wasn't referring to your kid's
hypocrisy. I was referring to yours.

20:49.958 --> 20:52.669
Why don't we just ask her
how she died?

20:52.794 --> 20:55.547
Because she won't tell us.
She thinks her mother's still alive.

20:55.672 --> 20:59.134
I don't mean ask the patient.
I mean, ask her mother.

21:01.637 --> 21:02.763
Cool.

21:04.681 --> 21:05.933
Come on.

21:10.354 --> 21:11.813
What the hell
does that mean?

21:11.939 --> 21:13.732
You guys talking
your own language now?

21:13.857 --> 21:17.569
I'm sorry. I'll try to include
some visual aids next time.

21:23.367 --> 21:24.910
Now, what?

21:26.411 --> 21:29.873
I'm Dr. House.
ls your mom around?

21:29.998 --> 21:32.167
Why should I tell you?

21:32.292 --> 21:34.586
You're just gonna tell me
I'm lying or crazy.

21:34.711 --> 21:38.423
I'm not gonna do that. I really
need to know what she has to say.

21:38.548 --> 21:39.716
What do you want?

21:39.841 --> 21:41.009
When you were young,
was she...

21:41.134 --> 21:43.428
No, not you. Him.

21:44.304 --> 21:46.139
The man in the wheelchair?

21:46.264 --> 21:48.308
No. He's old.

21:52.854 --> 21:55.816
Actually, looks like you.

22:05.325 --> 22:08.286
Yeah, that's Grandpa House.

22:08.412 --> 22:10.163
Tell him to call back
on a landline.

22:10.288 --> 22:12.374
Terrible reception in here.

22:12.499 --> 22:14.001
How much pain
was your mom in?

22:14.126 --> 22:15.127
It's Walter.

22:15.252 --> 22:16.962
He says his name is Walter.

22:41.737 --> 22:44.489
Can I help you?

22:44.614 --> 22:47.117
My patient's talking to
my Grandpa Walt.

22:47.242 --> 22:49.411
You have a Grandpa Walt?

22:49.536 --> 22:50.787
Nope.

22:50.912 --> 22:52.080
Which is what made me suspect

22:52.205 --> 22:54.541
that maybe she's not actually seeing
into the afterlife.

22:54.666 --> 22:56.710
What is this sudden obsession
with the afterlife?

22:56.835 --> 23:00.047
My only obsession is with the idiots
in the right-here-and-now life

23:00.172 --> 23:01.465
who think there's
an afterlife.

23:01.590 --> 23:03.925
- And you want me to...
- Nothing.

23:04.051 --> 23:08.430
Just needed a place to hang low for
a while. I'm pretending to be spooked.

23:08.555 --> 23:09.389
Because?

23:09.514 --> 23:13.602
Because if my soon-to-be-brain-dead
patient thinks that I believe her,

23:14.311 --> 23:16.980
maybe she'll let me chat
with her mother's ghost.

23:17.105 --> 23:19.024
The one you don't
believe exists.

23:19.149 --> 23:20.108
Exactly.

23:20.233 --> 23:23.028
The ghost is a hallucination,
which is the result of a delusion,

23:23.153 --> 23:25.822
which most likely is the result
of a hereditary disease

23:25.947 --> 23:28.075
that her mother died from
when the patient was four.

23:28.200 --> 23:31.244
And you think you can
tap into her subconscious memory

23:31.369 --> 23:33.288
by tapping into
her hallucination.

23:33.413 --> 23:34.998
Mmm-hmm.

23:35.123 --> 23:37.084
She might not know
what caused her mother's death,

23:37.209 --> 23:39.628
but she will know
how she acted before she died.

23:39.753 --> 23:42.005
You're quite impressed with yourself
right now, aren't you?

23:42.130 --> 23:42.964
(SPUTTERS)

23:43.090 --> 23:44.758
Who wouldn't be?

23:45.884 --> 23:48.136
Well, that should
be long enough.

23:48.261 --> 23:49.971
(SIGHS)

23:50.097 --> 23:51.681
Back in a flash.

23:52.307 --> 23:53.934
Take your time.

23:59.731 --> 24:01.817
Is my grandfather still here?

24:01.942 --> 24:02.776
No.

24:02.901 --> 24:04.736
He should be right back.

24:04.861 --> 24:07.114
IRENE: He just went
to get some warm milk.

24:07.823 --> 24:09.366
But your mom's still
here, right?

24:11.076 --> 24:13.453
(CHUCKLING) Yes, of course.

24:15.080 --> 24:20.836
I know she's fine, now, but when
you were four or five, she got sick.

24:20.961 --> 24:21.795
No.

24:21.920 --> 24:24.339
You sure?
She wasn't in any pain?

24:24.464 --> 24:26.258
I wasn't in pain.

24:26.383 --> 24:27.801
No, she was just tired.

24:27.926 --> 24:30.011
And sometimes
she would stay in bed all day.

24:30.137 --> 24:31.138
Did she ever fall down?

24:31.263 --> 24:32.305
Of course.

24:32.430 --> 24:34.850
Everyone falls down
once in a while.

24:34.975 --> 24:36.852
Sometimes, not that often.

24:36.977 --> 24:38.186
How often?

24:39.437 --> 24:42.983
Maybe it was actually
more than once in a while.

24:43.817 --> 24:44.985
(GASPS)

24:45.110 --> 24:46.611
Remember that time
in the bathroom?

24:46.736 --> 24:47.904
Mmm.

24:48.029 --> 24:49.739
A few times.

24:49.865 --> 24:52.242
Once she hit her head
on the bathroom sink.

24:52.367 --> 24:54.744
There was blood all over the floor.

24:54.870 --> 24:57.122
I got it on my sweater. I...

25:02.752 --> 25:03.753
They took her away.

25:03.879 --> 25:06.089
Yeah, to the place
where the doctor made her better.

25:06.214 --> 25:08.675
But before that,
what about her arms and legs?

25:08.800 --> 25:12.053
Did she ever walk funny,
like, sort of bent over?

25:12.179 --> 25:13.221
(LAUGHS)

25:13.346 --> 25:16.433
I thought that was from
growing up on the farm!

25:16.558 --> 25:18.018
What about her hands?

25:18.143 --> 25:21.313
Did she ever have any difficulty
sewing, buttoning a shirt?

25:21.438 --> 25:22.439
No.

25:22.564 --> 25:23.523
(GASPS)

25:23.857 --> 25:28.320
But sometimes
my hands would shiver.

25:29.112 --> 25:32.991
Like I was cold, but I wasn't.
I never quite understood.

25:33.116 --> 25:36.620
She used to get the shivers.
Like she was cold.

25:49.257 --> 25:50.300
(SIGHING)

25:50.425 --> 25:54.346
Start her on L-dopa
and bromocriptine.

25:54.471 --> 25:56.264
It's just Parkinson's.

26:07.484 --> 26:10.362
Cole, how's it going
with your patient?

26:11.321 --> 26:13.114
Still seeing stuff.

26:13.240 --> 26:15.659
I hear House is
treating you like crap.

26:15.784 --> 26:16.910
He treats everyone badly.

26:17.035 --> 26:18.787
Yeah, but I heard
you're special.

26:18.912 --> 26:21.164
Well, I can handle it.

26:21.289 --> 26:25.293
Maybe you shouldn't. He's gonna
walk all over you if you let him.

26:25.418 --> 26:27.671
That says nothing
about me, just him.

26:27.796 --> 26:30.507
House respects people
who aren't afraid of him.

26:30.632 --> 26:34.094
Get in his face.
Yell, if you have to.

26:34.219 --> 26:36.972
I don't need his respect.

26:37.097 --> 26:39.224
You do if you want the job.

26:41.309 --> 26:43.311
Thanks for the advice.

26:48.066 --> 26:48.900
(GROANING)

26:49.025 --> 26:50.068
You have to hold still.

26:50.193 --> 26:51.736
I'm trying!

26:51.861 --> 26:53.071
(IRENE GRUNTING)

26:53.196 --> 26:55.240
- Damn! Hold her down!
- No!

26:55.365 --> 26:57.701
- Stop it!
- Let me do it.

26:58.201 --> 27:00.036
No, no.

27:00.787 --> 27:01.663
(GASPS)

27:02.247 --> 27:03.707
Hold her down!

27:03.873 --> 27:05.083
(SCREAMING)

27:05.208 --> 27:06.418
No! No!

27:07.335 --> 27:09.087
(GASPING)

27:12.549 --> 27:13.550
No!

27:14.009 --> 27:15.593
(SCREAMING)

27:17.721 --> 27:19.055
Irene?

27:20.390 --> 27:21.433
Irene?

27:23.977 --> 27:25.020
You stabbed me.

27:25.145 --> 27:28.273
You were having a nightmare.
It wasn't real.

27:28.398 --> 27:30.108
My arm is bleeding.

27:30.233 --> 27:32.944
No. It's okay now,
your arm's not...

27:38.491 --> 27:41.244
Lesions aren't explained
by Parkinson's.

27:41.369 --> 27:43.204
Any theories?

27:47.500 --> 27:49.294
What, ghost got your tongue?

27:49.419 --> 27:51.171
I'm fine.

27:51.296 --> 27:52.505
HENRY: What about vasculitis?

27:52.630 --> 27:54.549
MRI didn't indicate
any cerebral ischemia.

27:54.674 --> 27:57.385
But she has shown some focal weakness,
urinary retention.

27:57.510 --> 27:59.054
Yes. Those are her big
mystery symptoms,

27:59.179 --> 28:01.473
not the hallucinations
that vasculitis doesn't explain.

28:01.598 --> 28:03.725
Unless it's
retinal vasculitis.

28:05.852 --> 28:09.314
House, this guy may be smart, and I'm
sure he's great to share a beer with,

28:09.439 --> 28:12.400
but if he doesn't know that
visual symptoms are an electrical issue,

28:12.525 --> 28:14.486
not vascular,
two separate systems...

28:14.611 --> 28:16.446
So are the banks and the power grid,

28:16.571 --> 28:20.241
but if I don't pay my bills
my lights go out.

28:25.246 --> 28:30.335
Vasculitis restricts blood flow to
nerves, messes with electrical function.

28:30.460 --> 28:32.545
Acute intermittent porphyria
is a better fit.

28:32.670 --> 28:35.673
If you're wrong about porphyria,
the treatment could box her kidneys.

28:35.799 --> 28:40.428
Vasculitis is treated with
corticosteroids, relatively harmless.

28:40.553 --> 28:42.180
- Start her on the steroids.
- House, he's not...

28:42.305 --> 28:45.475
Then test for both
so he can stop whining.

28:45.600 --> 28:50.814
Big Love, have I humiliated you
in the last half-hour?

28:50.939 --> 28:51.773
No.

28:51.898 --> 28:53.525
Check your e-mail.

29:00.115 --> 29:01.866
How's it going?

29:01.991 --> 29:03.368
Great.

29:03.493 --> 29:06.996
The only way he can turn any more cheeks
is by pulling down his pants.

29:07.122 --> 29:09.624
He's not a wuss.
It takes a lot more strength...

29:09.749 --> 29:11.751
We didn't bet on
how strong he was.

29:11.876 --> 29:15.213
So, you're gonna collect $100
and fire him because he has principles?

29:15.338 --> 29:18.550
What's your agenda here?
You obviously don't care about the 100.

29:18.675 --> 29:20.218
He's a decent, smart...

29:20.343 --> 29:21.428
You don't care
about the team.

29:21.553 --> 29:23.930
Does it annoy Wilson when you
ask questions and ignore the answers?

29:24.055 --> 29:25.390
Very much.

29:25.515 --> 29:29.185
You only care about
who I hire and who I fire

29:29.310 --> 29:31.896
because you miss
going through my mail.

29:32.021 --> 29:34.190
You can't stop
controlling me.

29:34.315 --> 29:35.817
No one controls you.

29:35.942 --> 29:37.569
- Want your job back?
- No.

29:37.694 --> 29:40.572
Too bad, you can't have it.
She'll take care of this.

29:40.697 --> 29:44.159
You can take it out of the 100
you're gonna owe me.

29:45.869 --> 29:48.872
I met House at a conference
about five years ago.

29:48.997 --> 29:50.915
- He's quite a character.
- Yes, he is.

29:51.040 --> 29:53.710
Probably one of the best medical minds
of our generation.

29:53.835 --> 29:56.212
I agree. I learned
an awful lot from him.

29:56.337 --> 29:59.549
I'll bet you did. I see here
you just did a stint at Mercy.

29:59.674 --> 30:00.842
Great.

30:00.967 --> 30:04.429
It says here "'07 to Present."
How long were you there?

30:04.554 --> 30:08.725
About a month. Dr. Schaffer was great,
but it just wasn't the right fit.

30:08.850 --> 30:11.853
Wait, was that you with Dr. Schaffer
and the lymphoma patient?

30:11.978 --> 30:15.773
It was... It was a tough situation.
I probably could've handled it better.

30:15.899 --> 30:20.361
No, Dr. Schaffer's
got a stick up her rear, good for you.

30:20.487 --> 30:22.030
What made you so sure
it was lymphoma?

30:22.155 --> 30:24.991
There was an unusual lactic acid level
in one of her labs.

30:25.116 --> 30:26.743
I had a similar case
a few months ago.

30:26.868 --> 30:29.787
Beautiful.
God, I wish I had your stones.

30:29.913 --> 30:30.914
(CHUCKLES)

30:31.039 --> 30:32.790
Well, my stones
are on the market.

30:32.916 --> 30:35.919
No, I mean, seriously,
I wish I had your stones.

30:36.044 --> 30:38.963
I could cram you down
the board of directors.

30:40.256 --> 30:43.468
But I don't. I'm sorry, man.

30:44.594 --> 30:45.887
Good luck.

30:47.972 --> 30:49.098
When your retinas
see something,

30:49.224 --> 30:51.518
they send electrical signals
to your brain.

30:51.643 --> 30:53.728
These lenses will pick
up those signals.

30:53.853 --> 30:55.897
AMBER: If the signals are misfiring,
it'll confirm

30:56.022 --> 30:58.775
that an old man without a medical
license is smarter than all of us,

30:58.900 --> 31:00.360
that your hallucinations
were caused by...

31:00.485 --> 31:03.321
They're not hallucinations.
Tell them, Mom.

31:03.446 --> 31:05.615
Honey, they're doctors.

31:05.740 --> 31:07.575
They must know
what they're doing.

31:07.700 --> 31:12.121
If they know what they're doing,
how did they kill that poor man's dog?

31:15.917 --> 31:18.795
Come on, this has got to be
freaking you out a little bit.

31:18.920 --> 31:20.547
I appreciate your concern.

31:20.672 --> 31:22.298
There's nothing to
be ashamed of here.

31:22.423 --> 31:24.300
If the ghost of a man you killed
doesn't screw with your head,

31:24.425 --> 31:26.844
there's something wrong
with your head.

31:33.434 --> 31:35.812
See, that freaks me out.

31:37.689 --> 31:40.108
Someone must have
left it in here.

31:40.233 --> 31:41.609
Absolutely,
that makes sense,

31:41.734 --> 31:42.944
some dog was in here
getting his eyes checked

31:43.069 --> 31:44.362
and forgot to put
his jewelry back on.

31:44.487 --> 31:45.697
IRENE: This isn't working.

31:45.822 --> 31:48.032
You're just making me sicker,
like he said you...

31:48.157 --> 31:48.992
(GAGS)

31:49.117 --> 31:50.201
What's wrong?

31:50.326 --> 31:52.495
My stomach, it hurts.

31:52.620 --> 31:54.080
(RETCHING)

31:56.332 --> 31:58.251
- Code in the eye lab.
- Lean forward, Irene.

31:58.376 --> 32:01.796
- You're gonna aspirate.
- I can't. It hurts.

32:01.921 --> 32:04.173
Why won't you help me?

32:05.466 --> 32:06.593
(GROANING)

32:09.470 --> 32:13.725
Spleen's ripe to bursting.
You guys thought it was vasculitis?

32:15.393 --> 32:16.936
You used to be on
House's team, right?

32:17.061 --> 32:19.814
Yeah. Got a lot of
blood in here. Sponge.

32:22.108 --> 32:23.359
You got any advice for me?

32:23.484 --> 32:24.319
Nope.

32:24.444 --> 32:26.154
You always put up
with his crap?

32:26.279 --> 32:27.322
Yeah.

32:29.407 --> 32:30.408
Was it a mistake?

32:30.533 --> 32:31.618
It was irrelevant.

32:31.743 --> 32:32.910
Well, he fired you.

32:33.036 --> 32:35.872
He'll fire you either way.
Eventually.

32:37.332 --> 32:39.167
- Dr. Cameron told me about...
- Don't want to know.

32:39.292 --> 32:42.670
- Why not?
- Because House is watching.

32:43.796 --> 32:45.798
Not a metaphor. Look up.

32:49.927 --> 32:51.304
<i>You guys gonna
shoot the breeze,</i>

32:51.429 --> 32:54.807
<i>or you gonna do something
about all that bleeding?</i>

32:56.225 --> 33:00.104
That's not coming from the spleen.
It's the liver.

33:00.229 --> 33:01.064
It's necrotic.

33:01.189 --> 33:03.066
She's dying
from the inside out.

33:10.782 --> 33:13.159
Enlarged spleen and
liver failure are classic AIP.

33:13.284 --> 33:14.577
It's porphyria
and it's moving fast.

33:14.702 --> 33:16.996
PBGs were negative.
If you read the reports...

33:17.121 --> 33:20.166
PBG tests are only conclusive
if done during an attack,

33:20.291 --> 33:22.377
which you would know
if you were a real doctor.

33:22.502 --> 33:24.128
That is just great.

33:24.253 --> 33:25.672
- What is?
- Which one of us is?

33:25.797 --> 33:28.091
Both of you. Together.

33:28.216 --> 33:31.010
Fighting. Passionate to
prove the other one wrong.

33:31.135 --> 33:34.180
Couldn't care less about the patient,
but it all works out the same.

33:34.305 --> 33:35.515
I hate Thirteen.

33:35.640 --> 33:37.934
Not as productively. Continue.

33:38.935 --> 33:40.061
It could still be vascular.

33:40.186 --> 33:42.021
Vasculitis is off the board.

33:42.146 --> 33:43.523
Steroid treatment didn't help.

33:43.648 --> 33:45.441
Vascular isn't just vasculitis.

33:45.566 --> 33:48.820
Something's got to be cutting off the
blood supply to her liver and spleen.

33:48.945 --> 33:51.406
Do a visceral angiogram.

33:51.531 --> 33:53.157
This is a joke, right?

33:53.282 --> 33:54.742
He can't be right
every single time.

33:54.867 --> 33:57.578
You're feeding him your ideas
just to embarrass us.

33:57.704 --> 34:01.874
If I wanted to embarrass you,
I'd have you mop up the doctors' lounge.

34:35.533 --> 34:40.204
Heavenly Father, I pray thee
that thou shalt give the Holy Ghost

34:40.329 --> 34:43.916
unto all them
that shall believe in their words.

34:45.835 --> 34:47.545
Irene, what are you doing?

34:47.670 --> 34:48.963
I need to touch it.

34:49.088 --> 34:49.922
Put your hand down.

34:50.047 --> 34:52.425
No! Give it to me!
I want it!

34:52.550 --> 34:55.178
Give it to me! No!

34:55.595 --> 34:57.805
(GRUNTING)

35:05.605 --> 35:06.647
What the angio say?

35:06.773 --> 35:08.191
We couldn't finish.
She started groping me.

35:08.316 --> 35:11.068
And you couldn't let her get to
second base just to get the test done?

35:11.194 --> 35:12.570
I think that's third base.

35:12.695 --> 35:15.490
She was convulsing, delirious
and hyper-salivating.

35:15.615 --> 35:18.326
We had to knock her out
with lorazepam.

35:18.451 --> 35:20.328
Well, that's definitely
not vascular.

35:20.453 --> 35:22.747
What do you want us to do?

35:22.872 --> 35:26.000
The question is,
what would Joseph Smith do?

35:26.125 --> 35:27.084
This isn't the time
for anti...

35:27.210 --> 35:28.211
Casting out the demons?

35:28.336 --> 35:31.172
The patient's not possessed.
She's dying. You can mock me tomorrow.

35:31.297 --> 35:34.801
You believe that the book
has all the answers.

35:34.926 --> 35:37.470
To morality, not science.

35:37.595 --> 35:39.180
But the book is
inconsistent with science.

35:39.305 --> 35:42.225
You know how many epileptics were
tortured because they were possessed?

35:42.350 --> 35:44.310
How many teenage witches
were stoned to death,

35:44.435 --> 35:45.394
because they took mushrooms?

35:45.520 --> 35:47.730
Just shut up already.
We got a patient dying.

35:47.855 --> 35:50.066
You either got to prescribe an exorcism,

35:50.191 --> 35:53.027
or admit to me
that Smith was a horny fraud.

36:01.035 --> 36:02.995
(SIGHS)

36:05.039 --> 36:06.874
I know what she has.

36:07.834 --> 36:09.669
You couldn't have spoken up
10 seconds ago?

36:09.794 --> 36:11.295
You would have saved me 100 bucks.

36:11.420 --> 36:13.798
Mushrooms weren't the only thing
that got people stoned to death,

36:13.923 --> 36:17.468
jimsonweed, belladonna,
mandrake root and moldy bread.

36:17.593 --> 36:18.719
It's ergot poisoning.

36:18.845 --> 36:19.846
You'd need
damp grain that's...

36:19.971 --> 36:21.973
Completely unprocessed
and untreated,

36:22.098 --> 36:25.810
like what's in that organic rye bread
she's been eating.

36:26.269 --> 36:28.271
- Should I be going home?
- Is it 6:00?

36:28.396 --> 36:30.314
It's why she got worse
on the bromocriptine.

36:30.439 --> 36:31.357
It's an ergot derivative.

36:31.482 --> 36:33.150
There hasn't been
a case in 50 years.

36:33.276 --> 36:35.570
She kept asking for milk.
Dairy products counteract the effects.

36:35.695 --> 36:37.405
You think she knew what she had
and was treating it?

36:37.530 --> 36:38.447
Cravings based on actual needs,

36:38.573 --> 36:40.658
it's a fairly common
evolutionary development.

36:43.703 --> 36:45.997
You okay with an answer
based on evolution?

36:46.122 --> 36:47.456
Yeah.

36:48.165 --> 36:49.667
Hypocrite.

36:52.295 --> 36:55.673
It's the stuff they make LSD from.
The treatment you're on should...

36:55.798 --> 36:58.593
So, I've just been tripping?

36:58.718 --> 37:02.471
It explains the hallucinations,
seizures, delusions...

37:02.597 --> 37:06.601
Constricts the blood vessels,
which explains the necrosis.

37:14.650 --> 37:16.319
She's not here?

37:21.824 --> 37:23.576
I'm sorry, no.

37:25.912 --> 37:28.915
The fact that you're even willing
to accept that answer

37:29.040 --> 37:32.126
means the medicine
is starting to work.

37:37.381 --> 37:38.925
But you'll live.

37:42.303 --> 37:44.430
You're beautiful, Reena.

37:46.057 --> 37:47.683
You too, Mama.

38:20.132 --> 38:21.926
I'm going to miss you.

38:26.389 --> 38:27.848
Mama.

39:01.882 --> 39:05.636
As you know,
there are seven of you and...

39:05.761 --> 39:07.763
One, two, three, four...

39:07.888 --> 39:09.306
Only six roses.

39:09.432 --> 39:11.183
Those are peonies.

39:12.560 --> 39:15.521
But I'm sure they're
part of the rose family.

39:17.148 --> 39:20.109
Actually, I'm surprised
there are seven of you.

39:20.234 --> 39:23.070
You punch your boss
and stick around?

39:26.073 --> 39:28.617
Give me the flower
and shut up.

39:28.743 --> 39:30.036
Don't overdo it.

39:30.828 --> 39:35.416
Now, I would love to keep all of you,
but not enough to do anything about it.

39:35.541 --> 39:40.504
So, according to my arbitrary schedule,
one of you has to go.

39:59.356 --> 40:00.858
You're kidding!

40:03.861 --> 40:07.239
I came up with the answer.
I robbed a grave. I...

40:07.364 --> 40:10.659
Planted a dog collar in the procedure
room just to screw with my head.

40:10.785 --> 40:12.536
No, I never.

40:14.997 --> 40:16.540
What, you don't
believe she did it?

40:16.665 --> 40:18.375
I'm sure she did it.

40:18.501 --> 40:22.755
That's why she's getting the flower.
It was beautiful, she just overreached.

40:22.880 --> 40:24.381
- She got into your head.
- No, I...

40:24.507 --> 40:26.300
She owned you.

40:26.425 --> 40:28.135
Planting the idea was good.

40:28.260 --> 40:31.806
Letting it fester was good.
Leaving the collar was stupid.

40:31.931 --> 40:35.518
Well-known fact,
ghosts don't leave things lying around.

40:36.268 --> 40:37.770
So, am I gone then?

40:51.450 --> 40:55.913
Oh, my goodness. I totally forgot
about you two. Well played.

41:11.720 --> 41:13.722
Sorry, Henry.

41:16.225 --> 41:17.768
We had some giggles.

41:18.727 --> 41:21.856
You agreed with everything he said.
You finished each other's sentences.

41:21.981 --> 41:23.941
That's why I got to go.

41:26.235 --> 41:29.029
Don't need someone to tell you
what you're already thinking.

41:29.155 --> 41:30.865
Funny, I was gonna say that.

41:30.990 --> 41:32.825
(CHUCKLES)

41:34.326 --> 41:37.413
- If you want to hang out...
- Yeah, I know.

41:37.538 --> 41:38.873
Call Wilson.

41:40.624 --> 41:42.918
The rest of you,
8:00 tomorrow.

41:50.009 --> 41:51.927
Cash will be fine.

41:53.929 --> 41:56.182
I bet you say that
to all the guys.

41:58.893 --> 42:00.936
Take your blood money.

42:02.396 --> 42:04.940
Who are you gonna
protect next?

42:05.065 --> 42:07.359
If I told you,
it wouldn't work.

42:16.952 --> 42:18.287
(DOOR OPENS)

42:21.832 --> 42:23.459
I've re-thought some things.

42:23.584 --> 42:24.752
Glad to hear it.

42:24.877 --> 42:28.005
I'm prepared to come back
on a number of conditions.

42:28.130 --> 42:30.466
I want the raise you promised,
plus five percent.

42:30.591 --> 42:33.135
I want my own office
and a personal assistant.

42:34.470 --> 42:36.555
That's not unreasonable.

42:36.805 --> 42:39.475
I will give you none of those.

42:40.476 --> 42:43.562
You can come back
at your original salary.

42:43.687 --> 42:45.356
What's going on?

42:46.690 --> 42:47.900
You haven't
re-thought anything.

42:48.025 --> 42:50.945
You've just been black-balled.

42:51.070 --> 42:52.196
You're "House, Lite" now.

42:52.321 --> 42:53.864
The only administrator
that will touch you

42:53.989 --> 42:57.826
is the one who hired "House, Classic."

42:57.952 --> 43:02.122
The good news is she'll pretend
she's not doing you a favor.

43:07.962 --> 43:09.964
I can start Monday.
