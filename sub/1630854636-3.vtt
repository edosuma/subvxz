It feels like it.

09:21.127 --> 09:23.430
Nikki: You can spin
our Wheel of Redemption.

09:23.463 --> 09:24.831
You can get one point,

09:24.864 --> 09:26.442
and you could tie this game up
one to one.

09:26.466 --> 09:30.937
I think we spin it.
He thinks we spin it.
We spin it!

09:33.907 --> 09:37.577
We got Liquid Steak,
Rocky Mountain Oysters.

What the hell
is the Bar Mat?

09:40.947 --> 09:43.416
And then we got
a small sliver of hope.

Are you ready for the Wheel?

Rocky Mountain Oysters.

Call them what they are, Carson.

10:01.234 --> 10:02.736
For people who don't know,
they are

10:02.769 --> 10:04.904
the testicles of a bull,
deep-fried.

10:04.938 --> 10:07.007
Those are big testicles.
This was a big bull.

10:07.040 --> 10:08.742
Sam, I'm pissed
at you right now.

10:08.775 --> 10:10.477
You should be.

10:10.510 --> 10:12.112
Have a nice bite, enjoy.

10:12.145 --> 10:13.813
Oh, you're lucky.
It's fried.

10:13.847 --> 10:15.382
I'll get out
of the way.

Is that creamy?

10:21.054 --> 10:22.689
Shut up.
They're terrible.

10:22.722 --> 10:23.923
We already lost.

10:23.957 --> 10:25.392
You couldn't get it in the hole,

10:25.425 --> 10:27.360
and now you have
a mouthful of testicles, buddy.

10:27.394 --> 10:29.496
Clint Bowyer has proven
that he can't do anything

10:29.529 --> 10:32.465
other than eat a bull's balls.

10:32.499 --> 10:34.668
All right,
they got their one point.

10:34.701 --> 10:36.770
Let's give it to them.

Okay, we're just
getting started.

10:44.010 --> 10:45.378
Ohh! Ohh!
Ohh! Ohh!

10:45.412 --> 10:47.914
You can rewrite your history
with Jimmie Johnson,

10:47.947 --> 10:49.716

And later...

10:49.749 --> 10:51.885
Oh, is that where
it was supposed to go?

There is a Liquid Steak
on the board calling your name.

This is "Barmageddon,"

where a little party
never hurt nobody.

11:12.067 --> 11:14.536
That's right.
Okay, so I'm sure
you're all familiar

11:14.569 --> 11:16.771
with the game cornhole,
right?
Yep, good times.

11:16.805 --> 11:20.442
Okay, your goal will be
to get your beanbag,

11:20.475 --> 11:22.610
aka your corn kernel,
into the hole

11:22.644 --> 11:24.055
or on our Moonshine board,

11:24.079 --> 11:26.915
but you'll be using
one of our air cannons,

11:26.948 --> 11:29.084
and you'll earn 1 point
if you get it on the board,

11:29.117 --> 11:31.419
and you'll get 3 points
if you get it in the hole.

11:31.453 --> 11:34.689
This is Air Cannon Cornhole.

A little soft, a little soft.

They drank the Bar Mat.

17:50.465 --> 17:52.734
Nice work, boys.
You've earned it.
Terrible.

17:52.767 --> 17:54.836
The aftertaste
is the worst part.

17:54.869 --> 17:58.840
All right, congratulations,
Team Jimmie, right?

17:58.873 --> 18:01.142
You did what you needed to do,
earning a point

18:01.176 --> 18:04.446
and making up for the fact that
you can't put corn in a hole.

18:04.479 --> 18:08.750
So, now the teams are tied,
two games down, three to go.

18:08.783 --> 18:10.485
I hope you're ready
for our next one.

18:16.155 --> 18:18.195
You having fun?
You look serious.
I'm having a blast.

18:18.591 --> 18:20.393
You're getting to hang
out with a champ.

18:20.426 --> 18:23.129
How many times?
Seven.

18:23.162 --> 18:25.598
[ Cheers and applause ]

18:25.631 --> 18:29.302
All right, all right, all right,

18:29.335 --> 18:31.771
we are back
with more "Barmageddon."

18:31.804 --> 18:34.474
After our first two games,
our teams are tied

18:34.507 --> 18:35.942
with 2 points each,

18:36.042 --> 18:39.212
and now we are taking
the easiest Olympic sport

18:39.245 --> 18:41.214
and combining it
with the easiest way

18:41.247 --> 18:42.415
to catch a buzz for cheap.

18:42.448 --> 18:43.850
It's Keg Kurling.

18:43.883 --> 18:46.219
Carson:
Let's do Keg Kurling.

18:46.252 --> 18:48.421
Yes.

18:48.454 --> 18:50.623
Okay, so the goal
is to push those kegs

18:50.656 --> 18:52.458
towards the bullseye
on our fake ice rink.

18:52.492 --> 18:54.160
The closer you land
on the bullseye,

18:54.193 --> 18:55.762
the more points you earn.
Got it.

18:55.795 --> 18:57.806
On this ground, you'll see
a replica of Blake's tattoo.

18:57.830 --> 19:00.433
Blake's $5 tattoo.
Yep.

19:00.466 --> 19:02.535
So, you can't
cross the line, okay?

19:02.568 --> 19:05.371
If you knock your opponent
out of the circle,
they lose a point.

19:05.405 --> 19:07.373
Even better,
'cause I'm gonna knock your...

19:07.407 --> 19:08.508
out of the way every time.

19:08.541 --> 19:10.009
Like a bump draft.

19:10.043 --> 19:12.988
Bump his ass off the court
is what I'm gonna do.

19:13.012 --> 19:15.014
Giant shuffleboard,
for God's sakes.

19:15.048 --> 19:17.450
Giant shuffleboard.
Y'all ready to play
Keg Kurling?

Are you kidding me?
Are you kidding me?

19:40.873 --> 19:42.041
Oh!

19:42.075 --> 19:43.676
Is that where
it's supposed to go?

19:43.710 --> 19:45.678
Is that the bullseye
you were talking about?

19:45.712 --> 19:48.023
That's what I thought.
That's the bullseye.

19:48.047 --> 19:50.483
Wow.
All right, Jimmie,
let's see what you got.

19:50.516 --> 19:52.919
Have I ever sweat before?
Come on!

19:52.952 --> 19:54.954
I mean, you could
knock him out, Jimmie.

19:55.054 --> 19:57.032
Oh, I will.
Oh, he's gonna
knock him out.

That was good.

Jimmie doesn't say anything.
He's silent but deadly.

20:12.038 --> 20:14.640
Yeah.
He's a silent killer.
Every time.

20:14.674 --> 20:17.710
Yeah, just cropdusting you
every time.
Yes, he is.

That's good.

Check... Make sure
you have the aerodynamics.

20:40.400 --> 20:41.868
Make sure you're in the draft.

It's 4 to 2.
There you go, man.
Line it up.

How you like me now, buddy?
All right, so,
at the end of Round 1,

21:13.132 --> 21:17.804
Team Jimmie has 5 points.
That was a good one,
as always.
