01:21.081 --> 01:22.248
Good afternoon.

01:22.373 --> 01:23.541
Good afternoon.

01:24.209 --> 01:26.211
We're out of cereal.
I need you to go to the store.

01:26.294 --> 01:27.170
I need money.

01:27.545 --> 01:29.172
Yeah? How about a job?

01:29.297 --> 01:30.465
You want the kids to eat?

01:32.175 --> 01:33.885
Spend it all on food this time.

01:34.928 --> 01:36.554
-That's it?
-Yeah, that's it.

01:37.013 --> 01:38.515

01:41.726 --> 01:42.644
What's up?

01:42.727 --> 01:43.645
Come on.

01:43.728 --> 01:44.562
Hey.

01:45.313 --> 01:46.147

01:46.231 --> 01:47.607
Come on, guys, let's go.
Go with your mom.

01:47.690 --> 01:48.525
Come on, let's go.

01:48.942 --> 01:49.984
Go with Mama.

01:50.944 --> 01:52.487
-What you lookin' at?
-What?

01:52.570 --> 01:53.863
-Giving me attitude?
-Just leave me alone.

01:53.947 --> 01:56.199
-You just woke up.
You giving me attitude?
-Oh, my gosh.

02:00.745 --> 02:01.871
Don't ever get married.

02:05.250 --> 02:06.459
Come here.

02:06.709 --> 02:08.002
-Hmm?
-Come here.

02:08.711 --> 02:09.545
What?

02:09.628 --> 02:11.172
I wanna ask you a question.
Come here.

02:12.632 --> 02:13.466
What?

02:14.134 --> 02:15.009
What's he doing here?

02:15.260 --> 02:16.094
Who?

02:16.219 --> 02:17.053
Him.

02:18.138 --> 02:19.973
In front of my house,
sitting in the car. Huh?

02:20.682 --> 02:21.516
Come on.

02:21.599 --> 02:24.144
I just had him give me a ride,
so I'm having him
wait out there.

02:24.227 --> 02:25.228
I deal with you.

02:25.770 --> 02:28.356
-I know, that's why
I'm having him wait--
-Bring him inside.

02:28.690 --> 02:30.567
It's gonna attract
attention out there.
Come on, fuck!

02:30.650 --> 02:32.318
-Right now?
-Yes, now. Bring him in.

02:32.402 --> 02:33.570
All right.

02:35.321 --> 02:36.906
Yo, Beaver, come on.

02:38.491 --> 02:39.492
Come in.

02:45.832 --> 02:47.167
You guys having
a good play date?

02:59.470 --> 03:01.222
I'm sorry,
you want a fucking tour?

03:32.086 --> 03:33.796
Keep your head down
and your mouth shut.

03:37.342 --> 03:38.718
Close the door behind you.

04:01.032 --> 04:01.866
Hey.

04:02.283 --> 04:03.451
Don't touch anything.

04:03.910 --> 04:05.286
That shit will blind you.

04:05.912 --> 04:06.829
It will.

04:08.539 --> 04:09.540
Am I picking up?

04:29.435 --> 04:30.270
What?

04:34.899 --> 04:35.733
What?

04:37.318 --> 04:38.361
You sure?

04:39.570 --> 04:42.115
I mean,
it was a slow month.

04:42.323 --> 04:43.283
- Slow month?
- Yeah.

04:45.535 --> 04:47.537
I give you
something, Troy,
I want you to sell it.

04:47.620 --> 04:49.497
I understand.
 It was just a slow month, though.

04:49.580 --> 04:51.207
I didn't give
it to you to play with it.

04:51.332 --> 04:53.334
- I fell you. I--
- I can help out.

04:57.964 --> 04:59.382
I'm sorry. What did you say?

05:00.925 --> 05:02.135
I can help you.

05:02.802 --> 05:05.138
We spoke about it,
and you know,
I can come in,

05:05.221 --> 05:06.931
I can help out, you know.
I need the money.

05:07.015 --> 05:09.142
Oh, I didn't speak
to him about shit.

05:09.517 --> 05:10.935
What are you talking
about, Beaver?

05:19.902 --> 05:20.820
He can help me.

05:20.903 --> 05:22.864
He doesn't know
what the fuck
he's talking about.

05:22.947 --> 05:24.490
That's good. That's good.

05:25.366 --> 05:26.367
That's good.

05:27.952 --> 05:29.037
I could use some help.

05:30.330 --> 05:32.957
I've been looking for some help.
Thank God
you're here to help me.

05:33.708 --> 05:35.209
- It's fucking great.
- Whoa.

05:37.003 --> 05:38.004
How're you gonna help me?

05:38.087 --> 05:39.297
Whoa, whoa...
Wyatt, Wyatt...

05:39.589 --> 05:40.631
How're you gonna help me?

05:40.923 --> 05:43.301
Hey, you don't have
to worry about him, Wyatt,
he's not--

05:43.384 --> 05:44.302
Just tell me.

05:44.385 --> 05:45.511
Wyatt, it's cool.

05:46.262 --> 05:47.221
Wyatt, Wyatt...

05:47.305 --> 05:48.306
How're you gonna help me?

05:48.514 --> 05:50.391
Wyatt, Wyatt... Chill, man.
You don't want--

05:50.475 --> 05:52.560
Maybe there's something
about my business
I wasn't thinking about.

05:52.643 --> 05:53.603
You don't have
to worry about him.

05:53.686 --> 05:56.481
Something I didn't think of,
you're gonna give
me some advice? Huh?

05:57.982 --> 05:59.692
Wyatt, listen to me.
You don't got to
worry about him.

05:59.776 --> 06:00.902
You know why I worry?

06:02.487 --> 06:03.946
'Cause you're fuckin' stupid.

06:05.615 --> 06:07.283
I ain't goin' to jail
for your mistakes.

06:12.663 --> 06:14.165
Better keep your
little mouth shut.

06:27.720 --> 06:28.763
It's just water.

06:30.807 --> 06:32.016
Next time it won't be.

06:36.729 --> 06:38.397
- Stack's by the door.
- All right.

06:38.815 --> 06:40.274
- Sell everything I give you, Troy.
 -For sure.

06:40.399 --> 06:41.275
Let's go. Beaver, let's go.

06:41.359 --> 06:43.236
-No more fucking excuses.
-For sure. For sure.

06:44.654 --> 06:45.488
Right here?

06:51.452 --> 06:54.789
So you find this guy,
brand new shoes, brand new suit.

06:56.082 --> 06:57.959
Might you be suspicious of him?

06:58.918 --> 07:00.086
- Yeah, I would.
- All right.

07:00.503 --> 07:02.839
Joel came out of prison, right?

07:03.840 --> 07:05.842
Does anybody know
why he was in prison?

07:07.385 --> 07:10.221
I'm wondering what's going on.
Did you guys read the book?

07:11.013 --> 07:14.600
I hope you did
because it s pop quiz time.

07:15.726 --> 07:17.478
Books under your desk,

07:17.645 --> 07:19.772
phones and electronics away,

07:19.897 --> 07:21.190
pens out, people.

07:21.607 --> 07:25.194
You all have till 10:00
to complete the test.

07:25.862 --> 07:26.904
Good luck.

07:39.459 --> 07:40.501
You're late.

07:40.835 --> 07:42.879
Please have a seat, quickly.

07:43.045 --> 07:44.797
In the middle of taking a test.

07:45.381 --> 07:47.467
Pass this down to Mr. Tardy.

08:00.980 --> 08:02.523
What you got? A?

08:03.191 --> 08:04.150
St. Angelo?

08:05.109 --> 08:06.402
I don't know.

08:32.511 --> 08:33.596
You got any cash on you?

08:33.679 --> 08:34.514
No, I don't have anything.

08:34.597 --> 08:35.597
You got any cash on you?

08:35.681 --> 08:37.390
-No, but I got some--
-Okay, then fuck you.

08:37.475 --> 08:40.394
You guys aren't smoking my weed
'cause you guys never pick up...

08:41.979 --> 08:43.481
I smoke you guys out
every week...

08:43.563 --> 08:44.690
-Hey.
-Hey.

08:44.815 --> 08:47.235
Hey, you know, I never do that.

08:47.360 --> 08:48.528
What? Take a pop quiz?

08:48.611 --> 08:51.864
No, like, copy answers.
I hate English, you know.

08:52.532 --> 08:53.699
Well, that's a lie.

08:54.867 --> 08:58.371
It's all right.
I never let dudes
cheat off me, so, you owe me.

08:58.496 --> 09:00.331
All right, all right.
I owe you one.

09:01.791 --> 09:03.292
We're hangin' out tonight.

09:03.709 --> 09:04.919
I can pick you up at 8:00.

09:05.419 --> 09:06.420
It's not that easy.

09:06.546 --> 09:07.880
Come on. Why not? Why not?

09:08.506 --> 09:09.840
Because we don't
know each other.

09:10.675 --> 09:11.551
All right...

09:12.635 --> 09:13.594
What do you wanna know?

09:15.304 --> 09:16.305
What do you need to know?

09:16.514 --> 09:18.474
You wanna see a magic trick?
Is that what it is?

09:18.683 --> 09:19.600
Really?

09:20.184 --> 09:21.227
You got a pen?

09:21.477 --> 09:23.396
All right, let's see. All right.

09:24.438 --> 09:25.314
There you go.

09:27.275 --> 09:28.568
-Real pen, right?
-Mmm-hmm.

09:28.651 --> 09:29.485
-Yeah?
-Mmm-hmm.

09:31.654 --> 09:32.488
Wow.

09:32.572 --> 09:35.157
See, that's why
we should hang out.
Come on, give me your number.

09:35.241 --> 09:36.826
I don't date high school guys.

09:37.994 --> 09:40.496
What the fuck, bro?
What the fuck was that, Beaver?

09:43.499 --> 09:44.667
Real fucking smooth.

09:45.293 --> 09:48.421
Hey, come on. I mean,
that was a good trick, right?

09:48.504 --> 09:49.338
Let's hang out.

09:49.422 --> 09:51.882
-I just wanna get to know you.
-It's never gonna happen, okay?

09:51.966 --> 09:54.719
Can you get that
through your head?
Or are you some kind of retard?

09:55.845 --> 09:57.638
Hey, you don't
have to use that word.

10:00.141 --> 10:02.268
I can take a hint.
You don't have to use that word.

10:04.478 --> 10:05.605
Okay?

10:06.105 --> 10:07.648
Whoa, whoa. Hey.

10:07.857 --> 10:10.359
Wait. I'm sorry, okay?

10:11.527 --> 10:12.361
I am.

10:13.779 --> 10:14.780
You were saying?

10:18.117 --> 10:20.119
We just hang out
at this place
called Grover's Lot.

10:20.244 --> 10:22.204
It's this old
abandoned parking structure.

10:22.955 --> 10:24.290
We just drink and shit.

10:25.458 --> 10:26.542
Okay, so...

10:26.876 --> 10:29.045
you wanna go to some
junkyard and do what,

10:29.128 --> 10:30.713
drink beer out of paper bags?

10:31.339 --> 10:33.466
-I just thought that--
-I'll see you at 8:00.

10:36.344 --> 10:37.303
Cool.

10:39.347 --> 10:40.598
You wanna know where it is?

10:43.726 --> 10:44.894
Yo, Sheila!

10:45.227 --> 10:46.145
Sheila!

10:46.228 --> 10:47.188
What up?

10:47.271 --> 10:48.272
You gained some weight?

10:48.356 --> 10:50.566
-Go fuck yourself, Troy.
-In a good way. In a good way.

10:51.025 --> 10:52.735
I'm trying to give
this girl a compliment,

10:52.818 --> 10:54.278
and she's like taking it
a lil' personally.

10:54.362 --> 10:57.198
She's like fillin' herself out.
More cushion
for the pushin', you know.

10:57.782 --> 10:59.492
Speaking of prude,
that girl, Kat,

11:00.409 --> 11:03.496
I heard she gave Steve Russell
a knobber in Mickey D's lap.

11:03.704 --> 11:04.747
Bullshit, man.

11:05.039 --> 11:06.457
-Bullshit?
-Bullshit.

11:06.624 --> 11:07.500
Ain't bullshit.

11:07.583 --> 11:09.001
Yeah, you probably heard that
from Steve Russell.

11:09.085 --> 11:11.420
I did hear it from
Steve Russell,
but that don't make it dog lie.

11:11.504 --> 11:13.214
-Why is he gonna lie?
-Why is he gonna lie?

11:13.297 --> 11:14.340
Yeah. You call him a liar.

11:14.423 --> 11:16.092
'Cause she's a smokin' hot
piece of ass, that's why.

11:16.175 --> 11:19.387
Beaver, don't get strung out
by that cock knocker, all right?

11:19.678 --> 11:22.014
I mean, it ain't about
scoring pussy anyway.

11:22.098 --> 11:24.183
I've seen her sweat
in the first week she landed.

11:24.517 --> 11:27.686
No, man. A girl like that,
ain't gonna give a loser
like him a blowjob.

11:28.104 --> 11:28.979
You mean a handjob.

11:29.480 --> 11:30.314
What?

11:30.398 --> 11:31.899
A knobber, bro, is a handjob.

11:31.982 --> 11:33.109
What... For real? You sure?

11:33.234 --> 11:34.610
Yeah, yeah. It's a handjob...

11:34.944 --> 11:35.820
I think.

11:35.903 --> 11:37.154
You guys don't know, do you?

11:37.279 --> 11:38.948
Either way, she's a ho.

11:39.365 --> 11:41.367
Do you see the way
she ties her shirt up?

11:42.159 --> 11:43.411
Titties poppin' out.

11:43.619 --> 11:47.373
No panties on,
sex juice drippin'
out of her ears...

11:47.456 --> 11:48.833
She needs a Kleenex.

11:50.334 --> 11:53.212
Guys, she got it goin' on.
I mean, why shouldn't
she show it off, right?

11:53.295 --> 11:54.797
- I would.
- Yeah, you would.

11:54.880 --> 11:58.175
No, besides, I mean,
she's been coping with
a lot of shit being new and all.

11:58.342 --> 11:59.927
You gonna nail it or what, bro?

12:00.553 --> 12:02.555
-I don't know.
-What do you mean,
you don't know?

12:02.638 --> 12:04.223
You better get up in that, bro.

12:04.348 --> 12:05.558
-I don't know.
-Yeah.

12:05.641 --> 12:07.643
Yeah? Yeah? Yeah?

12:08.936 --> 12:10.896
Cop, cop, cop, cop.
Put that down.

12:11.230 --> 12:12.982
Shit...

12:16.819 --> 12:18.028
Stacking boxes on...

12:18.112 --> 12:19.447
I'm never getting a fuckin' job.

12:19.530 --> 12:20.364
What are you doin'?

12:20.489 --> 12:22.658
-You keep doin' it like--
-Can you hook me up?

12:23.200 --> 12:24.285
Can you hook me up?

12:24.827 --> 12:25.703
No, bro.

12:25.786 --> 12:26.662
He's selfish.

12:27.121 --> 12:28.038
It's not about that--

12:28.122 --> 12:29.123
To me, it is.

12:29.415 --> 12:30.374
It's not about that.

12:31.333 --> 12:32.626
I just don't know. I just--

12:33.878 --> 12:34.879
Is this your girl?

12:35.421 --> 12:36.630
Yo, anywhere!

12:36.881 --> 12:37.715
Is this her?

12:37.798 --> 12:38.716
Yeah.

12:41.302 --> 12:42.303
Oh, damn.

12:42.386 --> 12:43.471
Oh, my God.

12:43.679 --> 12:45.681
Yo, that's a nice ride.

12:46.015 --> 12:47.349
Yeah.

12:47.808 --> 12:48.684
I'm Kat.

12:49.101 --> 12:49.935
I know.

12:50.019 --> 12:50.853
Oh, really?

12:50.936 --> 12:51.854
Yeah, I know.

12:52.605 --> 12:53.481
I'll take that.

12:55.232 --> 12:56.108
Thanks.

12:57.276 --> 12:58.277
Where are you from?

12:59.361 --> 13:00.321
Which time?

13:00.654 --> 13:01.864
I don't know.

13:02.948 --> 13:03.782
Florida.

13:03.908 --> 13:05.201
- Oh, yeah?
- Mmm-hmm.

13:05.284 --> 13:06.452
Where in Florida?

13:07.369 --> 13:09.371
-Do you know Florida?
-Mmm-mmm.

13:09.455 --> 13:10.831
Okay. Why ask?

13:10.915 --> 13:15.669
I got, like, friends and family
there in Tampa and...
Orlando or something.

13:15.878 --> 13:17.004
That's where Florida is...

13:17.171 --> 13:18.088
Yeah.

13:18.339 --> 13:19.381
Hey, you party?

13:20.549 --> 13:22.009
Uh, depends.

13:22.092 --> 13:23.010
You get high?

13:23.093 --> 13:24.512
The answer's still the same.

13:25.429 --> 13:26.472
What you workin' with?

13:26.639 --> 13:28.265
I'll show you
what I'm workin' with.

13:28.349 --> 13:29.475
Jesus.

13:29.892 --> 13:31.435
What the fuck is this?

13:31.602 --> 13:32.645
What? What? What?

13:32.770 --> 13:33.938
Stems and seeds?

13:34.021 --> 13:35.356
-Gets me high.
-Gets the job done.

13:35.439 --> 13:36.357
Yeah.

13:36.440 --> 13:37.775
No. Uh-uh.

13:38.067 --> 13:38.901
Rude.

13:38.984 --> 13:39.860
Rude.

13:40.486 --> 13:41.487
You're picky!

13:41.612 --> 13:42.696
I am picky.

13:42.780 --> 13:44.365
Yeah, what's up with this girl?

13:45.658 --> 13:46.534
Don't...

13:47.576 --> 13:50.246
-God.
-I'm gonna go,
fucking tag some shit up.

13:50.663 --> 13:51.664
What do you mean?

13:52.831 --> 13:54.416
-Oh, he's gonna--
-Tag some shit up.

13:55.876 --> 13:57.461
Yo, who's got it?
Who's got the paint?

13:57.586 --> 13:58.420
You got? Here.

13:58.504 --> 13:59.380
Thanks.

14:02.841 --> 14:05.553
Rhonda, you have to move.
I'm making like a...

14:05.803 --> 14:07.054
-What?
-You have to move.

14:07.179 --> 14:08.806
No, I'm not gonna move.
I was here first.

14:08.931 --> 14:11.225
I'm gonna make
like a whole mural
on this wall, all right?

14:13.769 --> 14:15.145
Hey, you.

14:15.604 --> 14:16.855
You, come here.

14:21.569 --> 14:22.570
Fuck!

14:26.282 --> 14:27.658
This is fucked up!

14:27.992 --> 14:29.201
Here, I'll give you my jacket.

14:29.743 --> 14:32.246
-Here, you take my jacket--
-I don't want
your fucking jacket.

14:32.329 --> 14:33.956
It's warmer.
Just gimme your shirt.

14:34.039 --> 14:35.040
I got you.

14:38.544 --> 14:40.337
You're such an asshole!

14:40.754 --> 14:42.423
Oh, my God! Fuck you!

14:49.513 --> 14:51.557
So this is what I get
for letting you cheat off me?

14:52.391 --> 14:53.726
- This?
- Yeah.

14:55.728 --> 14:56.937
Got the whole night.

14:57.688 --> 14:58.856
I guess, yeah.

15:01.901 --> 15:02.776
All right.

15:09.867 --> 15:11.118
This is the good stuff.

15:11.368 --> 15:12.536
I've been saving it.

15:12.912 --> 15:13.746
For what?

15:15.080 --> 15:16.707
Just saving it, you know.

15:17.207 --> 15:18.042
It's good.

15:18.918 --> 15:19.835
Let me see that.

15:24.965 --> 15:26.800
Wow, it smells strong.

15:27.593 --> 15:29.303
Yeah, I told you
this is the good stuff.

15:30.262 --> 15:31.221
Just gonna make it.

15:34.350 --> 15:35.726
I... You know what, I...

15:36.769 --> 15:37.770
I can't.

15:40.856 --> 15:42.316
Come on. Oh, fuck.

15:43.776 --> 15:45.152
No, really. Save it. I--

15:45.235 --> 15:46.946
No, for real.
I thought you liked to party.

15:47.029 --> 15:48.781
No, I do. It's just...

15:49.907 --> 15:51.075
you know, my mom...

15:51.825 --> 15:55.037
hates me right now,
and I can't risk it.

15:57.665 --> 16:00.125
-Okay.
-I'm sorry. I just...

16:01.168 --> 16:02.002
Uh...

16:02.962 --> 16:04.046
Hey, give me your phone.

16:05.589 --> 16:06.465
Give me your phone.

16:20.229 --> 16:21.105
Boom.

16:23.774 --> 16:24.608
Text me...

16:25.693 --> 16:26.777
so I have yours.

16:29.655 --> 16:30.614
See you tomorrow.

16:31.407 --> 16:32.783
All right. Yeah. Later.

16:32.866 --> 16:33.701
Good night.

16:34.618 --> 16:35.703
Thanks for tonight.

16:36.870 --> 16:37.705
Yeah.

17:11.905 --> 17:14.074
- Forty.
- Fuck that. Twenty.

17:14.241 --> 17:15.117
Fine.

17:15.534 --> 17:16.617
The shit better be good.

17:17.368 --> 17:19.163
Don't fucking try
and rip me off again.

17:19.329 --> 17:20.164
Hey.

17:21.582 --> 17:22.915
Whoa, whoa. Who's this?

17:24.001 --> 17:24.835
She's cool.

17:26.170 --> 17:27.003
You need?

17:27.087 --> 17:28.380
We're good. Go.

17:31.091 --> 17:32.009
Where to?

17:32.342 --> 17:33.343
I know a spot.

17:41.852 --> 17:42.936
Thanks for driving.

17:43.479 --> 17:44.396
No problem.

17:45.522 --> 17:47.191
Yo, you sure
this is a good spot?

17:47.483 --> 17:49.109
Stop freaking out, Rhonda.

17:54.448 --> 17:55.282
You mind?

17:56.450 --> 17:57.785
No. Do it up.

18:17.763 --> 18:19.264
All right, all right, let's go.

18:19.389 --> 18:20.974
Fuck. Chill.

18:36.406 --> 18:38.492
Relax, stupid, greedy bitch.

18:38.700 --> 18:41.078
Stupid shit like that
caused Jeremiah to OD.

18:42.246 --> 18:43.247
Fucking idiot.

18:46.667 --> 18:47.501
You're up.

18:47.876 --> 18:48.794
Just go easy.

18:49.336 --> 18:50.254
Shit is cranked.

18:54.216 --> 18:55.425
What's it cooked with?

18:56.135 --> 18:57.010
Not sure.

18:57.177 --> 18:58.137
Ask Troy.

18:59.096 --> 19:00.097
He cooks it?

19:00.722 --> 19:03.559
Jesus, girl,
are you getting high
or writing a fucking book?

19:05.227 --> 19:06.061
Shut up.

19:09.648 --> 19:11.191
I'm sorry. I've got to go.

19:12.025 --> 19:12.860
Relax.

19:12.943 --> 19:14.194
I am, it's just...

19:14.736 --> 19:17.322
My mom's been glued
to my shit recently, and I...

19:17.406 --> 19:19.366
-I can't push it.
-She's been glued to my shit.

19:21.243 --> 19:23.287
She's been glued to my shit.

19:24.621 --> 19:26.540
Fuck her. You said it yourself.

19:26.748 --> 19:27.958
Yeah, I don't wanna push it.

19:32.838 --> 19:34.173
You ever done it before?

19:41.430 --> 19:42.472
Try it.

19:45.809 --> 19:47.060
Or not. Whatever.

19:47.186 --> 19:48.061
More for me.

19:54.568 --> 19:55.485
Troy.

20:00.324 --> 20:01.491
Why you knockin'? Gimme that.

20:01.575 --> 20:02.492
I lost the key, dude.

20:02.576 --> 20:03.869
-You lost the keys again?
-Yeah.

20:04.119 --> 20:04.995
So?

20:12.544 --> 20:13.420
Thanks.

20:15.047 --> 20:15.881
Where are you going?

20:16.673 --> 20:19.343
What, you want me
to bring this with us?
Go driving around with it?

20:19.676 --> 20:20.552
I don't know.

20:20.636 --> 20:21.720
You gotta think, man.

20:30.979 --> 20:32.105
Let's get some pizza.

20:32.606 --> 20:33.774
No, I wanna go Chinese, dude.

20:33.857 --> 20:35.317
I don't care. I wanna get pizza.

22:29.598 --> 22:30.515
I got it.

22:31.850 --> 22:33.351
Fucking phone, bastard.

22:40.525 --> 22:41.943
It's not in my room.

22:44.863 --> 22:46.031
It's in your pocket.

22:47.115 --> 22:48.533
-No.
-It's in your pocket.

22:48.742 --> 22:51.203
Dude, it's in the fucking
living room,
on the counter.

22:52.329 --> 22:53.246
It's right here.

22:54.372 --> 22:55.624
Jesus. Hurry up.

23:05.425 --> 23:06.510
Let's go!

23:08.053 --> 23:09.387
Stop bitchin'!

23:52.931 --> 23:53.932
Hello?

23:54.057 --> 23:54.891
Mom?

23:56.601 --> 23:58.562
- Sweetie?
- Mom, where are you?

23:58.645 --> 23:59.646
Baby,
give me the phone.

23:59.729 --> 24:01.231
-Hi, are you coming?
-Shit.

24:01.314 --> 24:03.483
Jimmy, what day is it?

24:04.484 --> 24:05.652
It's your day, Meredith.

24:06.987 --> 24:08.780
Yeah, no... I'll be right there.

24:09.698 --> 24:10.699
Shit.

24:22.919 --> 24:23.795
Hey.

24:23.879 --> 24:24.796
Did you forget?

24:25.046 --> 24:26.798
I overslept. I'm sorry.

24:27.465 --> 24:28.925
You haven't seen
him in three weeks.

24:29.009 --> 24:29.926
Hi!

24:30.594 --> 24:32.679
I missed you!

24:33.722 --> 24:35.682
Okay, come on,
let's get in the car.

24:41.229 --> 24:42.105
Okay.

24:46.318 --> 24:47.194
How are you?

24:47.569 --> 24:48.403
I'm fine.

24:49.154 --> 24:50.947
I wish you were
a little better than "fine."

24:51.615 --> 24:52.908
Well, I'm on a job right now.

24:52.991 --> 24:54.034
You know how it is.

24:54.159 --> 24:56.494
Yeah. I do. I know.

24:56.828 --> 24:57.662
How's life?

24:57.996 --> 24:59.080
How's Sharon?

24:59.998 --> 25:01.583
Sharon's good. Things are good.

25:01.750 --> 25:02.667
Really good.

25:03.793 --> 25:04.711
Cool.

25:06.421 --> 25:07.881
-I'll go get his stuff.
-All right.

25:10.175 --> 25:11.760
You in deep again?

25:13.762 --> 25:15.263
I don't know.
This one's different.

25:15.472 --> 25:16.348
Oh, yeah?

25:18.058 --> 25:18.975
How's that?

25:19.184 --> 25:20.727
It's just different.

25:20.852 --> 25:23.355
I... I can't really
talk about it.
You know that.

25:25.982 --> 25:27.192
I don't know how you do it.

25:29.527 --> 25:30.528
What's that?

25:31.529 --> 25:34.324
I guess, I mean "why."
I don't know why you do it.

25:35.158 --> 25:38.328
I mean... you're driven,
that's usually a good thing.

25:38.411 --> 25:39.371
But?

25:39.955 --> 25:40.956
But...

25:42.332 --> 25:45.919
But what you do
is dangerous, Mere.

25:46.002 --> 25:46.962
Okay, don't lecture me.

25:47.045 --> 25:48.296
-It's not a lecture--
-You are.

25:48.380 --> 25:51.466
You're telling me
to put aside my job
to be a better mom.

25:51.549 --> 25:52.425
That's...

25:52.550 --> 25:53.760
-I would--
-Why not?

25:53.843 --> 25:54.928
Well, I will.

25:55.345 --> 25:56.513
I will. Just...

25:57.097 --> 25:58.515
As soon as I'm done
with this one.

25:59.474 --> 26:01.434
Okay. All right.
I mean, you know...

26:02.018 --> 26:03.395
Do whatever you have to do.

26:03.812 --> 26:04.813
I mean, it's...

26:05.772 --> 26:07.857
Sharon's fine
having him full-time.

26:07.941 --> 26:10.235
She loves him and he's starting
to warm to her, so...

26:10.318 --> 26:11.278
Full-time?

26:13.321 --> 26:14.864
-Nice.
-If that's all right with you.

26:14.990 --> 26:16.116
No, it's not.

26:17.951 --> 26:18.827
Here you go, sweetie.

26:18.910 --> 26:20.453
All right.
Have him back by tomorrow.

26:20.537 --> 26:21.496
Will do.

26:22.247 --> 26:23.123
Bye, buddy.

26:29.129 --> 26:30.338
All right, sweetie.

26:32.966 --> 26:33.800
Ready?

26:43.560 --> 26:45.061
Are we gonna
have some fun today?

26:48.857 --> 26:50.066
Oh, come on.

26:58.908 --> 27:00.118
All right.

27:07.042 --> 27:09.127
But he's the funniest guy
I've ever seen in my life.

27:09.377 --> 27:10.545
Come on, man. You all right?

27:10.795 --> 27:12.380
-He drinks too much.
-Are you all right?

27:12.630 --> 27:13.840
You drink too much, Flip.

27:13.965 --> 27:14.799
Come on, man.

27:15.216 --> 27:16.051
Fuck up, Troy.

27:16.509 --> 27:17.844
Come on, let's go inside.

27:18.636 --> 27:19.596
You all right?

27:20.388 --> 27:23.099
He's too Italian for alcohol,
he's gotta stick with weed.

27:24.851 --> 27:26.144
Come on, just lay down.

27:27.354 --> 27:29.856
Not in my room, not in my room.
Not in my bed, not in my bed.

27:29.981 --> 27:30.899
-Put him on the ground.
-All right.

27:30.982 --> 27:32.025
Hey, where's the weed?

27:32.150 --> 27:33.443
Sit here, mate, all right?

27:33.526 --> 27:34.527
Who got the weed?

27:37.364 --> 27:39.157
Since when did you
become so responsible?

27:39.240 --> 27:40.492
I got the motherfucking weed.

27:41.076 --> 27:42.077
I'm responsible?

27:42.160 --> 27:43.620
Give me the motherfucking weed.

27:43.703 --> 27:45.580
Gina's got
the motherfucking weed.

27:46.456 --> 27:47.582
Now you'll taste her.

27:47.707 --> 27:48.750
Yo, Eddie!

27:48.917 --> 27:49.876
All right.

27:52.796 --> 27:53.755
What is that?

27:53.838 --> 27:54.798
What is that?

27:54.964 --> 27:56.633
-What?
-What kind of hit is that?

27:56.716 --> 27:57.717
I thought you're from Florida.

27:57.801 --> 27:59.386
I thought you guys
are real toakers
from Florida.

27:59.469 --> 28:01.805
What happened
to all that big talk?
What was that?

28:01.888 --> 28:03.223
Beaver, show her how it's done.

28:03.306 --> 28:04.224
Show me.

28:04.307 --> 28:05.642
-Yeah!
-Show me.

28:06.559 --> 28:07.769
It's not rocket science.

28:07.852 --> 28:09.687
Oh, God. Oh, no.

28:09.771 --> 28:11.314
Look at this kid.
Look at this kid.

28:11.398 --> 28:14.317
His lungs go down to his dick!

28:15.693 --> 28:16.611
Yeah.

28:16.694 --> 28:17.821
-Fuck!
-Yeah.

28:17.904 --> 28:19.364
-No!
-Yeah, let her have it.

28:19.447 --> 28:20.615
What kind of frog are you?

28:20.698 --> 28:22.117
Yo, Kat,
what kind of frog are you?

28:22.200 --> 28:24.119
-What?
-There's two kinds
of frogs in the world.

28:24.202 --> 28:26.454
-I didn't know that.
-Let me tell you the story.
Hold on.

28:26.746 --> 28:29.082
Come on, you heard the story
about the two frogs?

28:29.165 --> 28:31.126
There's two kinds.
I'm about to drop
some knowledge on you.

28:31.209 --> 28:32.043
I wanna know.

28:32.210 --> 28:34.796
All right, listen.
There's two kinds
of frogs, right?

28:34.879 --> 28:36.131
And you're either
one or the other.

28:36.214 --> 28:37.841
-It starts like this.
-All right.

28:37.924 --> 28:39.509
So there's
a pot of water, right?

28:39.634 --> 28:41.970
And it's boiling.
It's brought to a boil.

28:42.095 --> 28:43.555
The frog hops into it,

28:43.638 --> 28:45.140
hops right out,
'cause it's boiling.

28:45.265 --> 28:46.349
And just like, it was hot.

28:46.433 --> 28:47.934
- Jumps right out, right?
- Yeah.

28:48.017 --> 28:49.144
But then there's
the other frog--

28:49.227 --> 28:50.228
What are
you talking about?

28:50.311 --> 28:52.021
Just listen to me.
I know what
I'm talking about, Gina.

28:52.105 --> 28:54.399
I know what I'm talking about.
Just let me tell the story.

28:54.482 --> 28:57.277
I'm trying to drop
some philosophy on Kat.
She doesn't know this shit.

28:57.360 --> 28:59.237
-She's never heard it like you.
-I know the fucking story!

28:59.320 --> 29:00.989
-You're being selfish here!
-Oh, fuck.

29:01.072 --> 29:02.657
Listen. So then...

29:02.824 --> 29:06.578
So then, there's this
pot of water, right,
that's lukewarm.

29:06.661 --> 29:07.954
-Yeah. Okay.
-Right?

29:08.121 --> 29:12.125
The frog jumps into it,
starts swimming around
like he's at the Ritz-Carlton,

29:12.208 --> 29:14.335
-just havin' a good ol' time.
-Yeah.

29:14.419 --> 29:17.046
And then we slowly
bring that water to a boil.

29:17.297 --> 29:20.300
But that frog just stays in it
as it's brought to a boil,

29:20.467 --> 29:21.676
and that frog dies.

29:21.885 --> 29:23.052
Is that the end of the story?

29:23.136 --> 29:25.263
Yes. Beaver,
what kind of frog are we?

29:25.346 --> 29:26.890
I think that's
a stupid fuckin' story.

29:26.973 --> 29:30.059
Rhonda, I told you
that story before
and you said it was funny.

29:34.731 --> 29:36.524
- This is gonna come off, right?
-  -Yeah.

29:36.608 --> 29:37.984
I don't need
make-up remover?

29:38.318 --> 29:39.194
Maybe.

29:39.694 --> 29:40.820
I don't have that.

29:40.987 --> 29:43.072
Yeah, right,
open your eyes. Let's see.

29:43.740 --> 29:45.158
So pretty!

29:45.241 --> 29:46.993
-I look pretty?
-Yeah, so pretty.

29:47.076 --> 29:48.077
You look pretty.

29:50.705 --> 29:52.749
No, I seriously
went through this

29:52.874 --> 29:55.627
whole month of like, winking,
I couldn't stop.

29:56.503 --> 29:59.422
Like, I had to,
like, cut it out.

30:02.759 --> 30:03.760
You know what I think?

30:04.677 --> 30:05.512
What?

30:06.387 --> 30:07.597
You stoned.

30:08.348 --> 30:09.724
-No.
-Yeah?

30:09.808 --> 30:10.642
No.

30:12.268 --> 30:15.480
It takes a lot more than that
to get me high.

30:15.730 --> 30:17.649
-Oh, yeah?
-Trust me.

30:18.858 --> 30:21.402
Do you guys have
anything stronger
in this town or what?

30:23.196 --> 30:24.322
Why are you asking me?

30:25.740 --> 30:27.075
I don't know anything.

30:27.367 --> 30:29.828
Why don't you ask
your new BFF, Gina?

30:30.245 --> 30:31.913
Oh, really? Okay.

30:34.457 --> 30:36.709
But really,
do you have anything?

30:39.212 --> 30:41.005
Yeah. What are you looking for?

30:42.882 --> 30:44.008
Shards.

30:46.886 --> 30:47.846
You mean dope?

30:48.012 --> 30:48.930
Yeah.

30:50.306 --> 30:51.641
I don't know. Yeah.

30:53.977 --> 30:54.811
Yeah.

30:54.936 --> 30:56.020
Troy might have 'em.

30:56.688 --> 30:57.647
Yo.

30:58.523 --> 30:59.941
Did someone fuck
with the breaker?

31:00.024 --> 31:01.067
Police! Don't move!

31:01.150 --> 31:02.527
Police! Put your hands up!

31:02.610 --> 31:04.362
Put your hands in the air
where I can see them, right now!

31:04.445 --> 31:06.155
-They're up. They're up.
-What is this?

31:06.573 --> 31:07.490
What is this?

31:08.533 --> 31:10.368
You know marijuana
is illegal here, right?

31:10.451 --> 31:11.452
Where's the rest of the drugs?

31:11.536 --> 31:12.495
Where are the drugs?

31:13.246 --> 31:14.497
It's in the TV cabinet.

31:14.581 --> 31:16.624
Flip, what the fuck?

31:16.708 --> 31:17.792
Oh, look at that.

31:17.876 --> 31:19.294
Only reefers and pills.

31:21.796 --> 31:22.839
Oh, my God.

31:22.922 --> 31:24.424
-What the fuck was that?
-Fuck!

31:26.843 --> 31:27.844
Fuck!

31:27.927 --> 31:28.761
God...

31:28.970 --> 31:30.263
Fucking dick.

31:30.346 --> 31:31.306
Was that you?

31:31.389 --> 31:33.016
Oh, my God,
you guys are bitches!

31:33.099 --> 31:35.935
-Was that you?
-You're such a bitch, dude.

31:36.060 --> 31:37.645
You are such an asshole.

31:37.770 --> 31:39.272
What is wrong with you, guys?

31:39.355 --> 31:40.899
Why are you letting
me take your shit?

31:40.982 --> 31:41.983
Who is this?

31:42.275 --> 31:43.401
Who is this?

31:44.193 --> 31:45.028
He's Flip.

31:45.111 --> 31:46.404
You always give your drugs away?

31:46.487 --> 31:48.823
-No, he's fucked up.
-You should choose
better friends.

31:48.907 --> 31:50.617
-Fucked up.
-What's on your face, dude?

31:50.992 --> 31:52.911
Is that fuckin' make-up?
Are you wearing make-up?

31:53.036 --> 31:55.538
-What is wrong with you, dude?
-Oh, fuck, no.

31:55.622 --> 31:57.498
Did you do that to him?
Why are you laughing?

31:57.582 --> 31:59.375
-Stop with the light.
-Did you? You did that?

31:59.459 --> 32:00.585
-Yes, I did that.
-I was passed out.

32:00.668 --> 32:02.337
That's a really nice job.

32:02.754 --> 32:03.922
The fuck are you doin' here?

32:04.088 --> 32:05.214
Oh, I'm sorry,

32:05.590 --> 32:07.759
I didn't know
I had to fuckin' check with you,

32:07.967 --> 32:09.344
clear my itinerary.

32:09.427 --> 32:11.137
I'm just sayin'.
I'm sorry. I didn't...

32:11.638 --> 32:14.265
I didn't...
You scared the shit
out of me, Wyatt.

32:16.225 --> 32:17.226
Who are you?

32:18.937 --> 32:20.521
Who the fuck are you?

32:21.814 --> 32:23.983
I'm Prince Charming.
Couldn't you tell?

32:24.692 --> 32:25.860
No, I couldn't.

32:28.863 --> 32:30.323
You're in my cousin's house.

32:32.325 --> 32:33.785
I see you're friends
with Beaver.

32:34.869 --> 32:35.787
Mmm-hmm.

32:35.870 --> 32:36.996
How's that treatin' you?

32:38.831 --> 32:39.832
What do you mean?

32:42.961 --> 32:44.045
You fuckin' him?

32:46.339 --> 32:48.299
'Cause if you are,
I need to know something.

32:49.092 --> 32:51.761
Can you... Can you tell me
if the rumors are true?

32:53.262 --> 32:55.098
About him not having any balls.

32:55.556 --> 32:58.267
What? What are you laughing at?
No, I heard that, for real.

32:58.393 --> 33:00.311
Somebody told me that.
That he had no balls.

33:01.771 --> 33:03.481
Well, I haven't fucked him yet.

33:03.982 --> 33:07.694
But when I do, I'll be sure to
let you know
what I find down there.

33:08.403 --> 33:09.612
Yeah, you do that.

33:12.699 --> 33:14.534
Well, this is a party. Fuck.

33:16.411 --> 33:18.329
When you're done
playing dress-up,
come outside.

33:20.373 --> 33:21.708
Fuck's the matter with you?

33:43.938 --> 33:44.897
Hi.

33:45.023 --> 33:46.190
Hey.

33:50.361 --> 33:51.529
You all right?

33:52.739 --> 33:53.656
Yeah.

33:54.282 --> 33:55.616
You still want that thing?

33:56.701 --> 33:57.660
What thing?

33:59.829 --> 34:00.663
Oh, uh...

34:01.456 --> 34:02.999
Yeah. Yeah, I do.

34:12.675 --> 34:13.885
What do I owe you?

34:14.385 --> 34:15.594
-Sixty.
-Okay.

34:15.678 --> 34:17.263
-Pay me later.
-No, I've got cash.

34:17.554 --> 34:18.764
No, pay me later.

34:18.889 --> 34:20.516
Just go easy on that, all right?

34:21.476 --> 34:22.435
It's strong.

34:23.101 --> 34:24.103
Okay.

34:39.994 --> 34:41.370
How's your sandwich?

34:42.663 --> 34:44.165
Too much mayo.

34:46.042 --> 34:47.210
What do you need?

34:50.295 --> 34:51.339
I don't know.

34:52.005 --> 34:54.007
I don't have anybody
off the street.

34:55.217 --> 34:56.427
Where's the cook?

34:57.345 --> 34:58.387
I'm close.

34:59.764 --> 35:00.973
That's not good enough.

35:02.308 --> 35:04.602
You don't get the cook,
we go with the dealers.

35:04.769 --> 35:06.020
The dealers don't matter.

35:06.437 --> 35:07.480
They're kids.

35:07.772 --> 35:09.065
This fucker has a dozen of them.

35:09.148 --> 35:11.317
Whatever. Who gives a shit?
Bust them all.

35:11.442 --> 35:12.777
Set them back a year or two.

35:13.736 --> 35:14.862
They're useless.

35:15.947 --> 35:17.990
Unless we can get one
of them to go CI.

35:19.158 --> 35:20.368
Anyone close?

35:22.203 --> 35:23.329
Not yet.

35:23.996 --> 35:25.289
The fuck are you waiting for?

35:25.665 --> 35:27.458
Someone to ask you to the prom?

35:28.543 --> 35:30.962
Twelve died in this county
from ODs last year,

35:31.045 --> 35:32.255
six of them minors.

35:33.297 --> 35:34.715
Let's keep your
head in the game.

35:35.508 --> 35:37.802
These are people's lives
we're dealing with.

35:38.219 --> 35:41.139
If we're gonna bust them,
let's make sure we got
something more than dying bags.

35:41.222 --> 35:42.265
People's lives?

35:44.433 --> 35:46.185
Are you really saying
that to me?

35:47.061 --> 35:49.188
Do you know how fucking long
I've been doing this?

35:50.189 --> 35:53.109
Do you not think I'm aware
of what effect we have
on this community?

35:53.192 --> 35:54.944
We're doing this
for people's lives.

35:55.069 --> 35:56.612
Remember that.

36:31.355 --> 36:33.316
Hey, Kat.

36:33.941 --> 36:34.942
Kat?

36:35.776 --> 36:37.403
-Hey.
-What up?

36:37.987 --> 36:39.071
Nothin'.

36:39.739 --> 36:40.865
What are you doin' out here?

36:43.951 --> 36:46.162
I don't know,
I'm... lookin' to score.

36:46.245 --> 36:47.079
Huh?

36:47.538 --> 36:48.664
Lookin' to score.

36:48.915 --> 36:50.166
You're lookin' to score?

36:50.583 --> 36:51.584
Yeah.

36:52.168 --> 36:53.252
All the way out here?

36:53.836 --> 36:57.256
Gina said I might
have some luck.
Do you know anyone?

36:57.757 --> 36:58.758
No.

36:59.342 --> 37:00.593
We don't know anybody.

37:00.801 --> 37:02.762
We'll let you know
if we hear anything, though.

37:02.929 --> 37:03.930
That'd be nice.

37:04.096 --> 37:06.015
We're nice guys,
so you're in luck.

37:06.224 --> 37:07.141
I'll bet.

37:09.560 --> 37:10.853
-You don't believe me?
-Let's go.

37:10.937 --> 37:12.021
No, hold on a second.

37:12.104 --> 37:14.232
You don't believe me?
You don't think I'm a nice guy?

37:14.523 --> 37:15.483
I don't know you.

37:15.566 --> 37:16.609
No, you don't.

37:17.485 --> 37:19.445
All right. Well, see you later.

37:19.528 --> 37:20.738
I hope you mean that.

37:21.239 --> 37:22.949
I mean,
do you wanna see us later?

37:23.241 --> 37:24.492
Or are you just fucking with us

37:24.575 --> 37:27.036
like all the rest of
the pencil-dick
motherfuckers you do?

37:27.119 --> 37:29.121
-Let's go.
-No. Shut up.

37:30.164 --> 37:32.124
You wouldn't do that to us,
though, would you?

37:34.835 --> 37:37.838
Hate to feel like we're just
the dog, you're the thumper,

37:39.006 --> 37:41.759
running around in circles,
no bone in sight.

37:44.303 --> 37:46.138
I don't know what
you're talking about.

37:48.182 --> 37:49.225
Think about it.

37:49.392 --> 37:50.351
I will.

38:23.467 --> 38:24.468
This is definitely good.

38:24.552 --> 38:27.305
I know how it is in Florida.
You guys got the goods?

38:27.388 --> 38:28.597
We got the goods. Yeah.

38:28.681 --> 38:29.974
- You got the quality.
- Oh, yeah.

38:30.933 --> 38:32.393
I mean, do you
wanna see us later?

38:33.269 --> 38:34.186
Or are you just fucking with us

38:34.270 --> 38:36.605
like all the rest of
the pencil-dick
motherfuckers you do?

39:02.631 --> 39:05.051
"'He give 'em to Pa for a shoat.

39:05.801 --> 39:08.971
We never did know
where he got that wire.'

39:09.180 --> 39:13.601
They slowed for the rise,
moving their feet
in the deep soft dust,

39:13.768 --> 39:15.728
feeling the earth
with their feet.

39:16.228 --> 39:19.732
Joad's eyes were
inward on his memory."

39:38.584 --> 39:39.585
How're you doing?

39:39.668 --> 39:40.503
Have a nice day.

39:41.170 --> 39:42.588
-Hi, there.
-Hi.

39:42.838 --> 39:43.756
Last name?

39:44.131 --> 39:45.549
Yeah. Pickin' up for Rivers.

39:46.717 --> 39:47.676
ID, please.

39:47.760 --> 39:48.677
Yep.

39:49.011 --> 39:50.304
-There you go.
-Great. Thanks.

39:50.388 --> 39:51.347
Thank you.

39:53.808 --> 39:54.850
Sore throat, huh?

40:01.816 --> 40:02.775
Here you go.

40:02.858 --> 40:03.734
Thanks.

40:08.155 --> 40:09.156
Is there a problem?

40:09.615 --> 40:12.159
Looks like your formulary
was amended.

40:12.618 --> 40:13.828
I get this every month.

40:14.412 --> 40:16.122
Part of my military disability.

40:16.205 --> 40:17.331
It's for anxiety.

40:17.623 --> 40:20.418
Your insurance
no longer covers it. Here.

40:22.628 --> 40:23.963
You're not listening to me.

40:24.630 --> 40:25.756
I need it.

40:29.176 --> 40:30.094
Give me a sec.

40:31.387 --> 40:32.304
Thank you.

40:35.266 --> 40:36.517
Sorry. I'll just be a minute.

40:38.602 --> 40:39.437
Hi.

40:42.690 --> 40:44.191
Sir, you have
to pay full price.

40:44.316 --> 40:45.443
It's not up to us.

40:46.610 --> 40:49.738
That's how you treat everybody
who put their life on the
line for your freedom?

40:52.366 --> 40:55.119
It's $282 without insurance.

40:59.999 --> 41:00.916
Excuse me.

41:02.042 --> 41:03.043
Listen...

41:03.586 --> 41:04.712
I can't afford it.

41:05.588 --> 41:06.547
I understand.

41:08.299 --> 41:09.133
Bullshit.

41:09.842 --> 41:11.093
You don't understand.

41:12.595 --> 41:14.305
-I bled for this country.
-Okay.

41:14.388 --> 41:15.598
Gave it my best fuckin' years.

41:15.681 --> 41:17.975
Now I'm supposed
to just bend over,
take it in the ass?

41:18.559 --> 41:20.269
While the government
gives handouts to

41:20.352 --> 41:23.397
fuckin' deadbeats
homeless people
and rag heads like you?

41:23.481 --> 41:25.024
-Wow.
-Yeah. Wow.

41:25.733 --> 41:26.567
Can I help you?

41:26.650 --> 41:28.402
I sacrificed for you people.

41:28.861 --> 41:29.778
Okay, sir.

41:33.949 --> 41:35.534
You're welcome, fuckers.

41:47.171 --> 41:48.047
Hey.

41:48.130 --> 41:49.340
Hey, Wyatt.

41:49.673 --> 41:50.841
You following me?

41:51.383 --> 41:52.384
Please.

41:53.594 --> 41:55.763
-I need a hit.
-I'm not a fuckin' dispensary.

41:55.846 --> 41:58.098
-Troy's not coming with us.
-I mean it, Gina. Beat it.

41:58.182 --> 41:59.183
Please, Wyatt.

41:59.767 --> 42:00.643
Please?

42:01.852 --> 42:03.562
Fuckin' Christ, Gina.

42:08.526 --> 42:09.443
Please?

42:10.069 --> 42:11.445
I'll do whatever you want.

42:12.947 --> 42:14.406
-Come here.
-Yeah?

42:17.284 --> 42:18.536
You're better than this.

42:20.663 --> 42:21.789
I know.

42:25.209 --> 42:26.585
Find a hobby, Gina.

42:27.461 --> 42:28.671
Fucking asshole!

43:44.538 --> 43:45.372
Hey.

43:46.415 --> 43:47.458
I've been knocking.

43:48.042 --> 43:49.585
I know. I heard you.

43:50.044 --> 43:50.919
Well...

43:51.837 --> 43:53.005
Did you think to answer?

43:54.590 --> 43:55.841
How do you know where I live?

43:56.675 --> 43:57.635
Flip told me.

43:57.843 --> 43:58.677
Flip?

44:00.638 --> 44:01.764
Shit.

44:04.892 --> 44:05.934
You okay?

44:07.144 --> 44:08.854
It's nothing I'm not used to.

44:08.979 --> 44:09.855
Who did that?

44:10.397 --> 44:11.315
What do you want?

44:12.066 --> 44:13.359
Beaver, who did that to you?

44:13.442 --> 44:14.276
What do you want?

44:21.241 --> 44:22.368
I owe you.

44:29.124 --> 44:30.250
Can I come in?

44:32.086 --> 44:33.087
You should go.

44:33.379 --> 44:34.254
Why?

44:36.006 --> 44:37.841
My dad's gonna
be back any minute.

44:38.133 --> 44:39.468
He's not a fan of guests.

44:41.512 --> 44:42.805
Sure I could win him over.

44:44.014 --> 44:45.557
No. Nah.

44:47.559 --> 44:50.979
You know, it's nothing personal.
He's just not a fan of people.

44:56.151 --> 44:58.028
What if I just
came in for a second?

44:59.238 --> 45:00.072
Please?

45:14.962 --> 45:17.047
It's not normally this messy.
Uh...

45:20.008 --> 45:22.469
Just give me a minute.
I'll clean it up.

45:24.430 --> 45:27.474
We were supposed to
do the laundry yesterday, but...

45:28.434 --> 45:30.727
we had to...

45:35.315 --> 45:36.233
Jeff?

45:37.943 --> 45:38.944
Just give me a minute.

45:40.571 --> 45:41.405
Jeff?

45:43.532 --> 45:44.491
Hey.

45:46.118 --> 45:47.077
What happened?

45:47.244 --> 45:48.287
It broke.

45:51.039 --> 45:52.040
It broke.

45:52.124 --> 45:53.459
Yeah. I can see.

45:54.334 --> 45:55.752
-You all right?
-Yeah.

46:00.466 --> 46:01.884
Let's tell Dad that I did it.

46:02.926 --> 46:04.052
-All right.
-All right?

46:04.136 --> 46:05.095
All right.

46:06.305 --> 46:07.389
This is my brother.

46:08.765 --> 46:10.392
-Hey.
-Hello.

46:17.232 --> 46:18.942
All right.
Go eat it in another room.

46:19.067 --> 46:19.902
-Yeah.
-Yeah?

46:19.985 --> 46:20.986
-Yeah.
-All right.

46:21.153 --> 46:22.488
You can go play a video game.

46:22.571 --> 46:23.489
Yeah.

46:25.365 --> 46:26.200
Bye.

46:26.283 --> 46:27.242
Bye.

46:33.123 --> 46:34.291
He seems cool.

46:34.374 --> 46:35.209
Yeah.

46:37.169 --> 46:39.129
He's a pain in the ass,
but I don't know...

46:41.507 --> 46:42.382
he's...

46:43.300 --> 46:44.426
he's very cool.

46:46.136 --> 46:47.721
My dad usually looks after him,

46:47.804 --> 46:51.683
but he spent a few extra
days at the lake with his
fishing buddies and...

46:54.102 --> 46:55.812
So after he gave
you that shiner...

47:12.621 --> 47:13.872
Put this on your eye.

47:16.917 --> 47:17.834
Thanks.

47:19.795 --> 47:22.214
You ever wonder
why things happen
the way they do?

47:24.174 --> 47:26.093
Some people, it's just so easy.

47:26.969 --> 47:27.886
And then...

47:28.637 --> 47:30.889
the rest of us,
we have to work for it.

47:32.474 --> 47:33.809
It fucking sucks.

47:35.143 --> 47:36.144
Yeah.

47:40.274 --> 47:41.984
I wanna get him out of here.

47:43.235 --> 47:45.237
I'm getting my brother
out of this place.

47:46.989 --> 47:48.657
There's this school in Oregon.

47:49.700 --> 47:51.702
It's supposed to be the best
for kids like him.

47:52.786 --> 47:53.870
And...

47:56.206 --> 47:58.166
I have 800 bucks stashed up.

48:00.085 --> 48:01.670
You give me about half of it.

48:07.801 --> 48:08.927
Thanks.

48:12.389 --> 48:13.390
What for?

48:16.643 --> 48:17.978
Letting me in.

49:06.068 --> 49:06.985
Yes.

49:07.194 --> 49:08.528
Stop. Stop.

49:12.574 --> 49:13.575
Fuck!

49:18.580 --> 49:19.790
-What?
-I'm sorry.

49:20.082 --> 49:21.041
I can't.

50:05.043 --> 50:06.586
Okay, I have one, too.

50:07.587 --> 50:08.547
Okay.

50:09.798 --> 50:11.675
Yeah, you grab that one.
You can have that one.

50:12.217 --> 50:13.218
Right here. Over here.

50:13.301 --> 50:14.511
Hold on, you guys.
Here, you want one?

50:14.594 --> 50:15.512
There you go.

50:15.595 --> 50:17.347
Of course, sweetie,
they're right there.

50:18.890 --> 50:20.934
-Meredith, it's good to see you.
-Hey.

50:21.017 --> 50:23.145
Yeah, you too, you too.
How are you?

50:23.270 --> 50:24.938
Good. Good.
Yeah, you know, just...

50:25.689 --> 50:26.523
-A lot...
-Yeah.

50:26.940 --> 50:28.275
-I can see that.
-I can...

50:28.358 --> 50:29.317
Thank you.

50:29.401 --> 50:31.695
-You made it.
-Yeah. In the flesh.

50:31.987 --> 50:34.322
Well, you know,
it's better late than never.

50:35.866 --> 50:37.117
We're really glad you're here.

50:37.617 --> 50:38.493
Thanks.

50:38.869 --> 50:41.580
Yeah, we have...
We have cakes still.
So let me get you a slice.

50:41.747 --> 50:42.622
Okay.

50:44.958 --> 50:47.294
Is it made out of
carrots and celery--

50:47.377 --> 50:50.130
-Okay, all right.
Come on, not now.
-And all that healthy shit?

50:50.797 --> 50:54.384
She's a vegan who
drives an electric car
and teaches yoga.

50:56.136 --> 50:57.220
Vegetarian.

50:57.637 --> 50:59.222
Oh, that's better.

50:59.306 --> 51:00.932
Hey, it's mine.

51:01.516 --> 51:02.893
It's mine!

51:02.976 --> 51:05.103
-I got it first!
-It's mine!

51:05.562 --> 51:06.521
Hey, buddy.

51:08.440 --> 51:09.316
Come on, one second.

51:09.399 --> 51:10.442
-It's mine!
-Okay.

51:11.026 --> 51:13.195
-All right.
-We're gonna
take a little time out.

51:13.320 --> 51:14.529
It's mine, Mommy.

51:14.613 --> 51:16.156
I know, sweetie.
We're gonna go--

51:16.239 --> 51:17.407
I'll see you
in a second, buddy.

51:19.451 --> 51:20.577
Did he say "Mom"?

51:21.369 --> 51:23.872
Yeah, he started
doing that recently.

51:25.040 --> 51:26.124
I don't like that.

51:26.249 --> 51:27.375
Well, he's confused.

51:33.215 --> 51:34.257
Does she live here now?

51:36.009 --> 51:39.095
She... She moved in
two weeks ago.

51:40.847 --> 51:41.765
All right.

51:43.141 --> 51:44.810
We... We got engaged.

51:45.018 --> 51:46.102
Just...

51:48.355 --> 51:49.356
Oh...

51:49.439 --> 51:50.482
Yeah.

51:53.944 --> 51:54.820
Congratulations.

51:54.903 --> 51:56.363
I was gonna...
I was gonna tell you.

51:56.446 --> 51:57.906
No, I'm happy for you.

51:58.240 --> 51:59.324
I just...

52:00.909 --> 52:03.370
Uh, I'm... I'm gonna go.

52:03.620 --> 52:04.621
Wait. Come on.

52:04.955 --> 52:06.665
-I just need a second.
-Mere, come on.

52:07.457 --> 52:08.375
Hey.

52:09.209 --> 52:10.502
Excuse me, guys.

52:12.921 --> 52:13.880
Meredith.

52:16.925 --> 52:19.928
Look, I'm... I'm sorry.
I didn't... That's not...

52:20.804 --> 52:22.514
I didn't know how
you were gonna take that.

52:22.597 --> 52:24.391
How did you think
I was gonna take it?

52:24.474 --> 52:26.643
It's just, I don't know,
I didn't want you to be upset.

52:27.435 --> 52:28.395
Well...

52:30.605 --> 52:33.233
It's fine.
I should have seen this coming.

52:35.694 --> 52:36.903
I waited for you.

52:37.988 --> 52:39.155
You know that.

52:43.243 --> 52:44.327
I'm sorry.

52:44.828 --> 52:45.871
I... Hey!

53:56.149 --> 53:58.068
-Hey.
-Hey.

54:03.031 --> 54:04.449
Fucked up...

54:09.746 --> 54:10.747
This guy.

54:10.830 --> 54:11.998
-You sure?
-Yeah.

54:14.626 --> 54:15.752
Wyatt Rivers.

54:16.294 --> 54:17.754
Wife, two kids.

54:18.296 --> 54:19.589
On tour in Iraq.

54:21.383 --> 54:22.467
Two priors.

54:23.051 --> 54:26.846
DUI and disorderly,
registered handguns,
permit to carry, no convictions.

54:26.930 --> 54:27.931
You think he's cooking?

54:29.391 --> 54:30.392
Yeah, maybe.

54:30.475 --> 54:31.393
Maybe?

54:31.768 --> 54:32.811
Where's your head at?

54:35.397 --> 54:37.148
I don't know. My kid, I guess.

54:40.402 --> 54:41.987
He barely recognizes me.

54:42.070 --> 54:44.239
I'm just... I'm having
a hard time following leads.

54:44.364 --> 54:45.991
You have to give me
something, anything.

54:46.074 --> 54:47.409
I know. I will.

54:47.784 --> 54:49.202
Get this shit
out of the streets.

54:50.245 --> 54:51.121
I...

54:52.831 --> 54:55.375
-I need more time.
-We don't have more time.

54:59.754 --> 55:03.091
Do this now,
and you and your kid
can go to fucking Disneyland.

57:11.177 --> 57:12.303
What are you doing?

57:14.848 --> 57:16.433
What the fuck
are you doing here, huh?

57:16.766 --> 57:18.852
-I'm... I'm sorry.
-What are you doing in my trash?

57:18.935 --> 57:21.104
I'm sorry!
I fucked up, okay, I just...

57:21.312 --> 57:22.480
I needed a taste.

57:22.564 --> 57:23.815
Need something...

57:24.023 --> 57:25.775
I'm... I'm sorry.

57:26.651 --> 57:28.361
Please.

57:28.445 --> 57:29.904
Don't hurt me.

57:34.826 --> 57:35.702
No.

57:42.083 --> 57:43.251
How do you know where I live?

57:44.419 --> 57:45.879
Everyone knows.

57:46.171 --> 57:47.797
They say you cook
the best stuff.

57:52.135 --> 57:53.052
Fuck!

57:53.136 --> 57:54.512
Okay, I'm just gonna go--

57:59.642 --> 58:00.643
Who says that?

58:01.227 --> 58:03.021
-I don't--
-Who the fuck says that?

58:03.104 --> 58:05.899
I don't know, Troy,
his brother, maybe,
I don't know.

58:06.774 --> 58:07.775
Just let me go.

58:08.276 --> 58:10.570
And I won't bother you again,
I promise.

58:16.993 --> 58:17.994
Please.

58:22.457 --> 58:23.374
Don't move.

58:44.103 --> 58:44.938
Go ahead.

58:45.271 --> 58:46.231
Thanks.

58:56.991 --> 58:58.743
This is the last time
I wanna see you here.

58:59.577 --> 59:01.955
-Okay.
-You don't tell anybody
where I live.

59:03.289 --> 59:04.332
-I won't.
-Ever.

59:04.415 --> 59:05.250
Got it.

59:12.549 --> 59:13.800
You know what's ironic?

59:14.926 --> 59:16.678
You make this
stuff everyone wants,

59:17.595 --> 59:19.514
then you get mad
when they need it.

59:26.604 --> 59:28.147
Not really that simple.

59:30.066 --> 59:31.985
I wouldn't expect
you to understand.

59:34.320 --> 59:35.738
-Try me...
-You can't.

59:36.948 --> 59:38.533
You're a victim of the system.

59:39.409 --> 59:41.995
You believe what you're told.
You're sheep among sheep.

59:45.206 --> 59:46.583
So you're a shepherd?

59:46.749 --> 59:48.126
I'm a businessman.

59:49.627 --> 59:52.171
This country got
five million people unemployed,

59:52.630 --> 59:55.550
twenty million in poverty,
but you're not
gonna find me on welfare.

59:56.801 --> 59:57.844
You go ahead,

59:58.761 --> 01:00:02.098
read all those history books
they give you.
Memorize all the lies.

01:00:02.890 --> 01:00:05.018
When you graduate
and they hand you a diploma,

01:00:05.977 --> 01:00:07.687
you tell me how far
they get you

01:00:08.187 --> 01:00:10.607
when they cut off
the electricity
and you can't pay the bill,

01:00:11.274 --> 01:00:13.151
or when you'll take
any fuckin' job,

01:00:13.985 --> 01:00:16.696
'cause you got
no food in your pantry
and your kids are hungry.

01:00:17.697 --> 01:00:19.032
If you don't take the job,

01:00:20.074 --> 01:00:21.743
spic down the block sure will...

01:00:22.660 --> 01:00:24.746
do twice the work
for half the pay.

01:00:29.417 --> 01:00:31.794
So, you're a businessman.

01:00:33.421 --> 01:00:34.631
This is your office?

01:00:35.673 --> 01:00:37.175
Work at home kinda guy?

01:00:41.721 --> 01:00:43.514
I think it's time for you to go.

01:00:45.475 --> 01:00:46.351
Yeah.

01:00:49.979 --> 01:00:50.855
Thanks.

01:00:53.274 --> 01:00:54.233
Hang on.

01:00:57.278 --> 01:00:58.112
Come here.

01:00:58.905 --> 01:00:59.739
Sit.

01:01:00.114 --> 01:01:01.491
-I--
-Gimme one sec.

01:01:30.269 --> 01:01:31.437
Came here for a fix...

01:01:32.730 --> 01:01:33.773
do it up.

01:01:36.359 --> 01:01:37.443
-Later.
-Now.

01:01:38.861 --> 01:01:39.946
You arms.

01:01:40.613 --> 01:01:42.699
For a junkie,
clean as fresh snow.

01:01:43.366 --> 01:01:44.992
No track marks in sight.

01:01:47.912 --> 01:01:49.455
-I only smoke it--
-Bullshit.

01:01:50.039 --> 01:01:51.791
Couple of minutes ago,
you were digging
through my trash,

01:01:51.874 --> 01:01:53.459
looking for used needles.

01:01:54.585 --> 01:01:55.753
You want me to trust you?

01:01:57.338 --> 01:01:58.965
I don't care if you trust me.

01:02:03.386 --> 01:02:04.345
You should.

01:02:58.524 --> 01:02:59.567
Don't look at me.

01:03:00.818 --> 01:03:02.361
What the fuck
are you waiting for?

01:03:32.225 --> 01:03:33.226
Get it in.

01:03:50.868 --> 01:03:51.869
Good?

01:04:21.357 --> 01:04:23.484
Yo, you were supposed
to be here 40 minutes ago.

01:04:23.985 --> 01:04:25.361
What gives? You forget...

01:04:27.780 --> 01:04:29.323
Whoa, Kat, hey...

01:04:30.741 --> 01:04:32.660
Yo, Kat, just...

01:04:35.162 --> 01:04:36.747
Hey, yo, let's get inside.
Come on.

01:04:36.831 --> 01:04:38.207
Get up. Get up. Get up.

01:04:38.291 --> 01:04:39.333
Come on. Now, get up.

01:04:42.044 --> 01:04:42.920
Fucking...

01:04:43.004 --> 01:04:44.714
Kat, where's your keys?
Where's your keys?

01:04:46.340 --> 01:04:47.300
Fuck!

01:04:52.597 --> 01:04:53.598
Fuck!

01:05:30.635 --> 01:05:31.677
Help me!

01:05:32.595 --> 01:05:33.763
Help me!

01:05:34.639 --> 01:05:35.932
Can I get
a doctor, please?

01:05:36.015 --> 01:05:37.099
Help!

01:05:37.224 --> 01:05:38.392
Sir, sir, sir...

01:05:38.809 --> 01:05:39.894
What's wrong with her?

01:05:51.155 --> 01:05:54.033
The doctor thinks
you're gonna...
You're gonna be fine.

01:05:56.744 --> 01:05:58.162
I'm just worried about you.

01:06:02.166 --> 01:06:03.292
Bad timing.

01:06:03.793 --> 01:06:05.586
Dad, give us a minute.

01:06:08.923 --> 01:06:09.882
Okay.

01:06:23.187 --> 01:06:24.230
How are you feeling?

01:06:26.857 --> 01:06:28.275
Like I fucked up.

01:06:28.901 --> 01:06:29.860
Yeah.

01:06:30.486 --> 01:06:33.364
Report is gonna say that
you were held down
and injected,

01:06:34.156 --> 01:06:35.533
trying to salvage this.

01:06:36.242 --> 01:06:37.785
These things happen sometimes.

01:06:38.911 --> 01:06:41.288
Toxicology said the batch was
as same as the rest.

01:06:41.414 --> 01:06:42.540
Fuckin' cheap.

01:06:43.708 --> 01:06:45.084
And highly toxic.

01:06:45.626 --> 01:06:48.004
But nothing to make me think
you were set up.

01:06:50.589 --> 01:06:51.924
I wasn't set up.

01:06:52.383 --> 01:06:53.759
Doesn't appear that way.

01:06:54.593 --> 01:06:56.137
Just a nasty OD.

01:06:57.054 --> 01:06:59.807
And if that kid hadn't
gotten you here so fast,
you'd be dead.

01:07:02.018 --> 01:07:03.227
I'm gonna talk to him.

01:07:03.310 --> 01:07:04.562
You will get your chance.

01:07:06.522 --> 01:07:08.524
First, I need you to
fill out some paperwork.

01:07:08.858 --> 01:07:10.443
Bring it around
the lot tomorrow.

01:07:11.360 --> 01:07:12.278
Tomorrow?

01:07:12.570 --> 01:07:13.571
But...

01:07:15.156 --> 01:07:18.534
What's the case say?
We've got nothing
but possession.

01:07:20.453 --> 01:07:21.662
We missed our shot.

01:07:22.663 --> 01:07:24.457
DEA wants me to get him now.

01:07:25.332 --> 01:07:26.250
No.

01:07:28.002 --> 01:07:29.170
Wyatt's cooking.

01:07:30.212 --> 01:07:33.049
If we nail him with possession,
he'll get out with
a slap on the wrist.

01:07:33.799 --> 01:07:35.259
And why do you need all of them?

01:07:35.593 --> 01:07:38.012
This is all we got,
because of this.

01:07:39.221 --> 01:07:40.222
So I need them.

01:07:40.306 --> 01:07:42.391
Troy, Beaver,
every one you fingered,

01:07:42.475 --> 01:07:44.894
otherwise this
whole fucking thing
is a waste of our time.

01:07:45.102 --> 01:07:46.479
That wasn't the plan.

01:07:46.604 --> 01:07:48.731
There's enough
marijuana charges
for all of them.

01:07:49.065 --> 01:07:50.858
I'm not here to bust potheads.

01:07:50.983 --> 01:07:52.818
You're not here to bust anyone.

01:07:53.402 --> 01:07:54.904
Not anymore.
You're off the case.

01:07:55.404 --> 01:07:56.989
They're shutting down
your apartment,

01:07:57.073 --> 01:07:59.742
so I need your phone
and the report
as soon as possible.

01:08:00.534 --> 01:08:01.911
You know, I know it's shitty,

01:08:02.828 --> 01:08:04.288
but you're alive.
Don't forget that.

01:08:07.625 --> 01:08:10.252
Get these questions
answered and bring
it back for me, okay?

01:08:10.336 --> 01:08:11.170
Thank you, sweetie.

01:08:17.009 --> 01:08:17.885
Hi.

01:08:18.301 --> 01:08:19.178
Hi.

01:08:19.303 --> 01:08:20.970
I'm here to see Kat Carter.

01:08:25.225 --> 01:08:27.019
I don't have anyone
here under that name.

01:08:27.103 --> 01:08:28.729
Oh, sorry. Katherine Carter.

01:08:32.733 --> 01:08:34.193
I don't see her in my system.

01:08:34.944 --> 01:08:36.362
Well, that can't be right.

01:08:36.779 --> 01:08:37.863
Can you look again?

01:08:38.488 --> 01:08:39.782
I already checked.

01:08:41.033 --> 01:08:42.785
Are you sure
she's a patient here?

01:08:42.952 --> 01:08:44.411
Of course, I'm sure.

01:08:44.495 --> 01:08:45.746
My friend dropped her off.

01:08:46.037 --> 01:08:47.706
Well, we've no one
here by that name.

01:08:48.999 --> 01:08:50.042
That's bullshit.

01:08:50.167 --> 01:08:51.292
Check again.

01:08:51.502 --> 01:08:52.336
Next.

01:08:52.920 --> 01:08:54.712
Thanks for being
of great fucking help.

01:09:02.971 --> 01:09:05.182
No, that was the best work, Sam.
You're right.

01:09:05.683 --> 01:09:06.892
Detective...

01:09:29.456 --> 01:09:30.332
Yo, Troy.

01:09:31.457 --> 01:09:33.252
Yo, we got next.

01:09:33.669 --> 01:09:35.129
Blow me, fuck face.

01:09:35.296 --> 01:09:36.421
All right, I'm telling Mom.

01:09:36.714 --> 01:09:38.716
-Hey, Mom.
-Blow me right now while I play.

01:09:38.841 --> 01:09:40.259
No, I'm telling Mom. Mom!

01:09:40.341 --> 01:09:41.260
You rat.

01:09:41.343 --> 01:09:42.178
Mom.

01:09:49.435 --> 01:09:51.060
Hey, she said let me play.

01:09:54.106 --> 01:09:56.233
-She said let me play, dude.
-No, she didn't.

01:09:56.317 --> 01:09:57.776
-She did. I swear.
-She's passed out.

01:09:57.902 --> 01:09:59.236
She's passed out
and you know it.

01:09:59.320 --> 01:10:01.238
Dude, fuckin' let us play
or I'll turn this off.

01:10:01.322 --> 01:10:02.198
No, you'll not.

01:10:02.281 --> 01:10:03.616
-Yeah, I am.
-Don't touch it.

01:10:03.782 --> 01:10:06.660
I'm about to get to
the next level. Don't touch...
Don't touch my game.

01:10:06.744 --> 01:10:08.037
Yeah, this is what you get, bro.

01:10:09.955 --> 01:10:10.831
Dude!

01:10:11.290 --> 01:10:12.166
Little motherfucker.

01:10:12.249 --> 01:10:14.043
What the fuck
did I tell you, huh?

01:10:14.501 --> 01:10:15.586
What did I tell you?

01:10:17.129 --> 01:10:19.757
Dude, just stop! Mom! Mom! Mom!

01:10:19.840 --> 01:10:21.550
-Hey, why are you
smacking yourself?
-Dude!

01:10:21.634 --> 01:10:22.635
-Dude! Mom!
-Like a bitch.

01:10:22.718 --> 01:10:23.844
Mom, Troy's beating me up!

01:10:23.928 --> 01:10:26.138
-Close your fists.
Close your fists.
-Dude.

01:10:26.222 --> 01:10:28.515
Dude, I will fuckin'
wreck your world.

01:10:28.599 --> 01:10:29.767
-Beat your own ass like a man.
-Fuck off!

01:10:29.850 --> 01:10:31.143
Help me out, dude. Come on.

01:10:31.227 --> 01:10:32.853
What, you think Beaver's
gonna help you?

01:10:36.732 --> 01:10:37.733
Whaddup, Wyatt?

01:10:37.816 --> 01:10:40.194
Yeah. Talk to you outside.

01:10:47.993 --> 01:10:49.328
What's the matter with you, huh?

01:10:54.667 --> 01:10:55.584
Yo.

01:10:56.001 --> 01:10:57.294
I owe you an apology.

01:10:59.296 --> 01:11:01.173
I didn't know
she was gonna react like that.

01:11:04.760 --> 01:11:06.303
Yeah, you could have killed her.

01:11:07.846 --> 01:11:08.764
You're right.

01:11:12.226 --> 01:11:14.061
I don't know what's wrong
with me, man.

01:11:15.688 --> 01:11:16.647
I...

01:11:17.690 --> 01:11:20.234
I have a hard time
trusting people, you know.

01:11:21.652 --> 01:11:22.736
Do you trust her?

01:11:23.237 --> 01:11:24.154
Yeah.

01:11:24.947 --> 01:11:25.906
You do?

01:11:30.661 --> 01:11:33.455
I don't know, Beaver.
I've been hearing
some weird shit, bro.

01:11:35.249 --> 01:11:36.333
Really weird.

01:11:37.584 --> 01:11:39.336
No, she's not gonna...
She's not a rat.

01:11:45.259 --> 01:11:46.260
Come here.

01:11:48.178 --> 01:11:49.138
Sit.

01:11:54.184 --> 01:11:55.352
Why'd you leave her there?

01:11:56.645 --> 01:11:57.896
Why didn't you stay?

01:11:59.898 --> 01:12:01.442
She was ODing and I didn't...

01:12:03.277 --> 01:12:05.279
I don't know.
I didn't know
what to do, I just...

01:12:05.654 --> 01:12:07.364
She's your friend,
and you left her alone?

01:12:08.866 --> 01:12:09.992
No, I just...

01:12:10.451 --> 01:12:11.285
Um...

01:12:13.746 --> 01:12:16.915
No, I... I dropped her off
and I got out of there.

01:12:16.999 --> 01:12:19.626
I just... there was people
there so I just got
out of there, you know.

01:12:19.710 --> 01:12:20.711
Did you talk to anybody?

01:12:22.171 --> 01:12:23.964
The fuck am I gonna
say to anybody?

01:12:26.133 --> 01:12:27.343
Did you talk to anybody?

01:12:28.969 --> 01:12:30.054
No.

01:12:37.895 --> 01:12:39.188
You're a good kid, Beav.

01:12:40.814 --> 01:12:41.899
I like you.

01:12:52.826 --> 01:12:53.952
Have fun today.

01:13:18.268 --> 01:13:19.269
Need some help?

01:13:26.443 --> 01:13:27.361
Come on.

01:13:35.869 --> 01:13:36.954
Fucking shit.

01:13:48.590 --> 01:13:50.551
Yo, you reached Beaver.
You know what to do.

01:13:58.642 --> 01:14:00.436
Hey! Where are you goin'?

01:14:00.519 --> 01:14:02.479
I... I just need
to step out for a bit.

01:14:02.896 --> 01:14:04.940
Hell, no, no.
You need to get your rest.

01:14:05.607 --> 01:14:06.650
Where are your keys?

01:14:06.733 --> 01:14:07.693
I don't...

01:14:07.776 --> 01:14:09.486
-Meredith...
-I'll be back.

01:14:09.611 --> 01:14:10.696
Meredith.

01:14:44.688 --> 01:14:46.523
-Hey.
-Hey.

01:14:46.607 --> 01:14:47.608
You scared me.

01:14:48.817 --> 01:14:50.152
Whose whip is this?

01:14:51.028 --> 01:14:51.862
Uh...

01:14:52.321 --> 01:14:54.072
It belongs to a friend of mine.

01:14:56.658 --> 01:14:57.951
Where the fuck have you been?

01:14:58.494 --> 01:14:59.828
You were in the hospital.

01:15:00.746 --> 01:15:01.788
I was.

01:15:02.623 --> 01:15:04.666
I had a bad reaction
to something.

01:15:06.668 --> 01:15:07.753
Are you okay?

01:15:09.630 --> 01:15:10.714
I'll be fine.

01:15:13.217 --> 01:15:14.384
Have you seen Beaver?

01:15:15.302 --> 01:15:16.261
No.

01:15:16.762 --> 01:15:17.721
You give him a ring?

01:15:18.013 --> 01:15:19.556
Yeah, he's not pickin' up.

01:15:20.224 --> 01:15:21.600
He's probably at Troy's.

01:15:22.017 --> 01:15:23.685
They said they were
drinking over there.

01:15:24.353 --> 01:15:25.896
Cool. Thanks.

01:15:26.605 --> 01:15:28.023
I was gonna head over.

01:15:28.899 --> 01:15:30.108
If you're going,

01:15:30.859 --> 01:15:31.902
give me a lift?

01:15:33.612 --> 01:15:34.446
Uh...

01:15:35.781 --> 01:15:36.949
-Yeah?
-Yeah.

01:15:37.533 --> 01:15:38.408
Cool.

01:15:39.076 --> 01:15:40.077
Get in.

01:15:40.202 --> 01:15:41.036
Thanks.

01:16:04.434 --> 01:16:05.352
Here.

01:16:06.895 --> 01:16:08.105
No, thanks.

01:16:09.022 --> 01:16:09.940
Right.

01:16:10.190 --> 01:16:11.900
You must be a little gun-shy.

01:16:12.818 --> 01:16:13.694
Yeah.

01:16:14.236 --> 01:16:15.946
What hospital were you at?

01:16:16.738 --> 01:16:18.365
Uh, Oak Grove.

01:16:20.367 --> 01:16:21.243
Really?

01:16:21.326 --> 01:16:22.411
Mmm-hmm.

01:16:23.287 --> 01:16:24.371
I came by.

01:16:27.374 --> 01:16:28.333
Really?

01:16:31.128 --> 01:16:32.087
When?

01:16:32.963 --> 01:16:33.922
Today.

01:16:36.550 --> 01:16:39.177
I... I got out last night, so...

01:16:39.636 --> 01:16:40.596
I was at home.

01:16:44.808 --> 01:16:45.934
Thank you, though.

01:16:46.935 --> 01:16:48.186
I really appreciate it.

01:16:49.438 --> 01:16:50.522
Yeah.

01:17:05.912 --> 01:17:07.122
Aren't you coming?

01:17:08.457 --> 01:17:11.501
Uh, no. Can you just
send Beaver out?

01:17:12.878 --> 01:17:13.920
Come in.

01:17:16.798 --> 01:17:17.924
I can't.

01:17:18.008 --> 01:17:22.471
Just... Last couple of
days, it's been... It's been
really hard, you know.

01:17:24.222 --> 01:17:25.265
Okay.

01:18:06.765 --> 01:18:07.724
Where the fuck is she?

01:18:07.808 --> 01:18:09.226
I don't know. She was just here.

01:18:25.992 --> 01:18:26.952
Beaver.

01:18:28.328 --> 01:18:29.246
Beaver.

01:18:31.498 --> 01:18:34.084
Oh! Kat! Fuck...

01:18:34.710 --> 01:18:35.752
Come over here.

01:18:35.836 --> 01:18:38.380
-Yo.
-No, I need to talk to you.

01:18:51.309 --> 01:18:53.019
-You all right?
-Yeah.

01:18:53.270 --> 01:18:54.354
You're all right.

01:18:56.064 --> 01:18:57.065
I just...

01:18:58.567 --> 01:18:59.943
I needed to say thank you.

01:19:03.280 --> 01:19:04.781
I can't believe
that you're here.

01:19:06.074 --> 01:19:07.033
Why?

01:19:07.951 --> 01:19:10.620
I just thought that
with your mom
and all that shit, you know...

01:19:12.330 --> 01:19:13.832
she'd drag you away and stuff.

01:19:16.042 --> 01:19:18.128
There's... There's something
I need to tell you.

01:19:20.255 --> 01:19:21.923
I need you
to listen to me, okay?

01:19:24.468 --> 01:19:25.594
Take Jeff,

01:19:26.261 --> 01:19:27.387
leave town.

01:19:28.180 --> 01:19:29.181
Please.

01:19:30.390 --> 01:19:32.309
I can't tell you why,
but just trust me.

01:19:34.770 --> 01:19:35.854
Can you do that?

01:19:38.064 --> 01:19:39.357
Where are we gonna go?

01:19:39.608 --> 01:19:40.442
Anywhere.

01:19:40.525 --> 01:19:42.027
-What?
-No, I mean it.

01:19:44.362 --> 01:19:45.530
I'm being serious.

01:19:46.573 --> 01:19:47.532
Just go.

01:19:48.408 --> 01:19:49.785
Now you're fucking with me.

01:19:49.868 --> 01:19:51.870
You're fucking with me,
all right?
What is this?

01:19:51.953 --> 01:19:53.330
I'm not fucking with you.

01:19:55.415 --> 01:19:56.541
Look who it is.

01:19:58.001 --> 01:20:00.879
I'm really surprised
you came back here... Kat.

01:20:01.421 --> 01:20:03.006
Whatever the fuck
your real name is.

01:20:03.089 --> 01:20:04.382
Yo, Wyatt, can we have a minute?

01:20:04.466 --> 01:20:05.634
No, you can't have a minute.

01:20:06.176 --> 01:20:08.595
Gina, why don't you tell
this slow motherfucker
what we know?

01:20:08.678 --> 01:20:10.305
Cunt's a fucking cop.

01:20:10.388 --> 01:20:11.807
-That's bullshit.
-The fuck it is!

01:20:11.890 --> 01:20:13.725
-No.
-Gina, what are you doing?

01:20:13.809 --> 01:20:16.353
I went to the hospital.
There was no record
of Katherine Carter.

01:20:16.436 --> 01:20:17.896
And I found your fucking chart,

01:20:17.979 --> 01:20:21.566
and in everything
your name's Meredith
or some fucking shit like that!

01:20:21.650 --> 01:20:23.401
-Get the fuck off!
-Watch out!

01:20:51.972 --> 01:20:53.890
Yo, Wyatt, no! Let it go, man.

01:20:54.266 --> 01:20:55.308
Wyatt, let it go, man.

01:20:55.392 --> 01:20:57.185
-Wyatt.
-Get the fuck out
of my way, Beaver.

01:20:57.269 --> 01:20:59.437
Kill the fucking
shit out of her.
Fucking liar!

01:20:59.521 --> 01:21:01.857
-Go home, Gina.
-What the fuck
are you doing, Wyatt?

01:21:03.608 --> 01:21:05.151
Get the fuck out, right now!

01:21:05.235 --> 01:21:07.195
-What--
-Troy, get these
fuckers out of here!

01:21:07.696 --> 01:21:08.989
Get out, get out!

01:21:09.072 --> 01:21:10.657
Get the fuck out. Get out.

01:21:11.199 --> 01:21:12.868
Beaver, what's goin' on?
What's goin' on?

01:21:13.535 --> 01:21:15.537
-What the fuck?
-Troy, what the
fuck is this, man?

01:21:15.620 --> 01:21:18.081
I told you to
get the fuck out
of here right now!

01:21:18.164 --> 01:21:21.167
Get out. I'll call you tomorrow.
Get the fuck out.

01:21:21.459 --> 01:21:22.669
What the fuck?

01:21:24.004 --> 01:21:25.171
-Tie that bitch up.
-Come on.

01:21:27.799 --> 01:21:29.384
Why am I tying her up?

01:21:29.467 --> 01:21:30.343
Come on.

01:21:30.844 --> 01:21:32.053
Gimme your fuckin' hands.

01:21:34.014 --> 01:21:34.931
Fuck!

01:21:36.141 --> 01:21:37.142
What the fuck?

01:21:38.226 --> 01:21:40.270
Troy, come on, man,
let's just fuckin' let her go.

01:21:40.353 --> 01:21:42.230
-Let her fucking go.
-Why am I tying her up?

01:21:42.314 --> 01:21:43.732
Beaver, help!

01:21:43.982 --> 01:21:45.191
Why am I tying you up?

01:21:45.275 --> 01:21:46.443
Help me.

01:21:47.485 --> 01:21:48.403
Yo.

01:21:49.237 --> 01:21:52.365
-Wh... Why am I tying her up?
-Get the fuck out of the way!

01:21:58.455 --> 01:21:59.664
Who the fuck are you?

01:22:01.291 --> 01:22:02.709
-Are you a cop?
-No.

01:22:03.251 --> 01:22:05.545
-Are you a fucking cop?
-No!

01:22:06.212 --> 01:22:07.088
Wyatt...

01:22:07.422 --> 01:22:09.215
-Is she a cop?
-Don't fuckin' do that!

01:22:09.299 --> 01:22:10.258
Is she a cop?

01:22:10.342 --> 01:22:11.885
Is she a fuckin'--

01:22:11.968 --> 01:22:13.428
Shut the fuck up!

01:22:14.804 --> 01:22:16.973
You bring a narc
into our fuckin' circle, huh?

01:22:17.057 --> 01:22:19.559
-She's not gonna fuckin' talk.
-Well, you're a fuckin' idiot!

01:22:19.809 --> 01:22:21.519
What the fuck is wrong with you?

01:22:21.811 --> 01:22:23.563
I'm tired of
asking that question.

01:22:26.274 --> 01:22:27.233
Fuck!

01:22:28.902 --> 01:22:30.028
Troy, follow me.

01:22:34.449 --> 01:22:36.534
-Is she a cop?
-Get in the fucking tub!

01:22:39.537 --> 01:22:41.081
Yo, you're fuckin' hurting her.

01:22:46.878 --> 01:22:48.588
Are you a fuckin' cop?

01:22:48.672 --> 01:22:50.173
Yes! Yes.

01:22:51.049 --> 01:22:52.092
Yes.

01:22:56.638 --> 01:22:57.722
Still trust her?

01:23:03.144 --> 01:23:04.354
Gimme the gun, Troy.

01:23:04.980 --> 01:23:07.107
-Wyatt, you need
to think about this.
-Give me the fucking gun.

01:23:07.190 --> 01:23:08.400
People know she's here.

01:23:08.483 --> 01:23:10.151
What the fuck?

01:23:15.198 --> 01:23:16.408
Take it, Beaver.

01:23:17.742 --> 01:23:19.285
-Why?
-Take the gun.

01:23:20.036 --> 01:23:20.996
No.

01:23:21.079 --> 01:23:22.080
What?

01:23:22.664 --> 01:23:23.832
She played you.

01:23:24.624 --> 01:23:25.917
She played all of us.

01:23:40.140 --> 01:23:41.266
Beaver, please...

01:23:46.604 --> 01:23:48.148
Wyatt, think about this.
Come on.

01:23:48.231 --> 01:23:49.149
Do it, Beaver.

01:23:49.482 --> 01:23:50.608
Please.

01:23:52.986 --> 01:23:53.820
Please.

01:23:53.903 --> 01:23:54.779
Pop her!

01:23:54.863 --> 01:23:56.531
-Please, don't.
-Do it!

01:23:56.614 --> 01:23:57.574
Please, don't.

01:24:00.952 --> 01:24:01.911
Fuck this.

01:24:02.037 --> 01:24:03.163
Fuck you, Beaver! Fuck--

01:24:03.246 --> 01:24:04.581
Guys, guys, guys!

01:24:06.332 --> 01:24:08.960
Come on.
You brought this
down on all of us.

01:24:11.129 --> 01:24:12.839
Now you're gonna fuckin' fix it.

01:24:15.300 --> 01:24:16.551
Wyatt, come on.

01:24:19.304 --> 01:24:20.346
Please, don't kill me.

01:24:20.430 --> 01:24:21.723
Which side are you on, Beaver?

01:24:22.432 --> 01:24:23.475
Ours or theirs?

01:24:25.977 --> 01:24:27.604
Beaver, please,
he's playing you--

01:24:27.729 --> 01:24:28.605
Shut up.

01:24:28.730 --> 01:24:30.774
-He's playing you--
-Nobody's playing him.

01:24:30.857 --> 01:24:33.109
You're the only one who's
playing. Has been that way
the whole fuckin' time!

01:24:33.193 --> 01:24:34.319
-Shut up!
-Do it--

01:24:34.402 --> 01:24:36.696
Shut up! Shut the fuck up!

01:24:39.365 --> 01:24:41.451
She doesn't respect you.
You know that.

01:24:41.618 --> 01:24:42.911
Beaver, stop.

01:24:43.328 --> 01:24:44.287
Just do it.

01:24:48.291 --> 01:24:49.501
Motherfucker.

01:24:49.626 --> 01:24:50.585
-No--
-I swear to God--

01:24:51.961 --> 01:24:52.879
No!

01:25:03.640 --> 01:25:04.516
Beaver...

01:25:05.558 --> 01:25:06.684
Beaver, hey...

01:25:53.439 --> 01:25:54.315
Hey.

01:25:59.237 --> 01:26:00.280
Show me the eye.

01:26:05.535 --> 01:26:06.911
You'll be fine in a few weeks.

01:26:09.873 --> 01:26:11.916
I can deal you back in
if that's what you want.

01:26:12.667 --> 01:26:14.127
It won't be free
and clear, though.

01:26:14.335 --> 01:26:15.920
Restriction's six months,

01:26:16.421 --> 01:26:17.881
then full reinstatement.

01:26:21.426 --> 01:26:22.385
Yeah.

01:26:22.802 --> 01:26:23.761
No, thanks.

01:26:25.763 --> 01:26:27.140
We did make a difference.

01:26:29.934 --> 01:26:32.312
Busting kids
on bullshit charges?

01:26:33.563 --> 01:26:35.940
Fucking up their potential
for a decent future?

01:26:36.399 --> 01:26:38.193
If we saved one life,

01:26:39.319 --> 01:26:41.321
its good enough for me.
You should feel the same.

01:26:44.073 --> 01:26:44.991
I don't.

01:26:46.284 --> 01:26:47.243
You don't?

01:26:47.744 --> 01:26:48.745
That's it?

01:26:50.288 --> 01:26:51.289
What are you gonna do?

01:26:55.668 --> 01:26:57.337
Go back to my normal life.

01:27:01.090 --> 01:27:02.300
Your normal life.

01:27:05.637 --> 01:27:06.721
See you around.

01:27:29.953 --> 01:27:30.870
All right.

01:27:36.626 --> 01:27:37.669
What's wrong, honey?

01:27:39.796 --> 01:27:42.215
I don't like pancakes.

01:27:43.383 --> 01:27:45.760
Yeah, you do.
They're your favorite, remember?

01:27:52.392 --> 01:27:53.309
All right.

01:27:54.852 --> 01:27:56.062
What do you want instead?

01:27:57.272 --> 01:27:58.106
Hmm?

01:27:58.856 --> 01:27:59.816
Eggs?

01:28:02.360 --> 01:28:03.194
Sure.

01:28:07.532 --> 01:28:09.575
Nathan... Nathan.

01:28:10.410 --> 01:28:11.369
Stay still.

01:28:11.995 --> 01:28:13.288
I am.

01:28:13.496 --> 01:28:14.497
No, you're not.

01:28:15.665 --> 01:28:16.708
It's not funny.

01:28:20.211 --> 01:28:21.087
There.

01:28:28.094 --> 01:28:29.762
All right, let's go.
We're gonna be late.

01:28:36.227 --> 01:28:37.103
All right.

01:28:37.812 --> 01:28:39.272
Hey, have you got everything?

01:28:40.106 --> 01:28:41.024
Hey, Meredith.

01:28:42.775 --> 01:28:44.610
-How're you doin', buddy?
Come on!
-Finally!

01:28:46.070 --> 01:28:48.114
