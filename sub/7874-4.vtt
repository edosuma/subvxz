WEBVTT

00:35.735 --> 00:38.735
My first meeting of the Langley
Conservative Republicans.

00:39.139 --> 00:41.140
Oh! I,ve dreamed of this day...

00:41.141 --> 00:44.141
for as long as I can remember you
telling me I,ve dreamed of this day.

00:44.244 --> 00:46.445
Plus, tonight is very special.

00:46.446 --> 00:49.446
They,re gonna announce who gets to speak
at this year's Republican National Convention.

00:50.350 --> 00:52.418
The buzz is your old man's a shoo-in.

00:52.419 --> 00:55.419
Awesome, Dad! You,re the most
abortion-hating, stem-cell-research-opposing...

00:56.389 --> 00:59.389
defecit-loving, affirmative-action-despising,
Bible-thumping xenophobe I know.

01:00.560 --> 01:02.661
I,ve been waiting
my whole life for this.

01:02.662 --> 01:05.662
And I can't think of anyone else
I,d rather share it with.

01:05.732 --> 01:08.732
Stan.
Stan, I,m ready to go. Stan?

01:11.004 --> 01:13.005
Didn't we already
go through a security check?

01:13.006 --> 01:14.940
Oh, they aren't checking
for weapons here.

01:14.941 --> 01:17.941
They,re checking for something
far more dangerous: gay.

01:18.711 --> 01:21.580
- Gay?
- Some Republicans want to allow gays...

01:21.581 --> 01:23.582
to attend the convention this year.

01:23.583 --> 01:26.583
The Langley Conservatives are determined
to keep them out and the party pure.

01:27.253 --> 01:30.253
Luckily, there are ways to identify them.

01:30.423 --> 01:32.891
Your typical homosexual male
will be in great shape...

01:32.892 --> 01:35.892
well dressed, wearing sandals, holding a brightly
colored drink and listening to Celine Dion.

01:36.996 --> 01:39.996
- I own sandals.
- Yes, but you can't pull,em off.

01:40.033 --> 01:43.033
And that's how you spot
your typical homosexual female.

01:44.871 --> 01:47.871
Check your fingernails for dirt.

01:48.341 --> 01:51.341
A gay would,ve checked
for dirt this way.

01:52.145 --> 01:54.146
What does E.R.A. stand for?

01:54.147 --> 01:56.415
Earned run average?

01:56.416 --> 01:59.384
A gay would,ve said
"Equal Rights Amendment....

02:02.155 --> 02:05.155
No! I just like musicals!

02:05.358 --> 02:07.926
So then it's cool to alienate gays?

02:07.927 --> 02:10.926
Yes, it is, Son.
Gays are the new blacks.

02:11.698 --> 02:13.699
Remember, Steve,
these hell-bound folk...

02:13.700 --> 02:15.701
have made a choice to be gay.

02:15.702 --> 02:18.537
And they won't rest until
everyone else is gay with them.

02:18.538 --> 02:21.240
- How do they do that?
- They,re insidious.

02:21.241 --> 02:23.275
It starts with them
asking to borrow a wrench...

02:23.276 --> 02:26.276
and ends with you on a boat to Mykonos
wearing a pair of"assless... chaps.

02:26.646 --> 02:29.646
Welcome Langley Conservatives.

02:29.849 --> 02:31.950
It's time to announce
who will be speaking for us...

02:31.951 --> 02:34.119
at the Republican National Convention.

02:34.120 --> 02:36.121
Throw this when they announce my name.

02:36.122 --> 02:38.924
I couldn't find confetti,
so I shredded a few napkins.

02:38.925 --> 02:41.026
It shouldn't be so hard
to find confetti.

02:41.027 --> 02:44.027
Nancy Calliope.

02:46.866 --> 02:49.866
Thank you, Steve. Thank you
for making my shame more festive.

02:54.274 --> 02:57.274
Snubbed by the Langley Conservatives
after all I,ve done for them.

02:58.311 --> 03:00.946
I mean, I,m the guy who suggested
a separate drink fridge.

03:00.947 --> 03:03.947
There are two fridges there now,
Francine, one that's just for drinks.

03:04.184 --> 03:06.618
My cheeses from Lyon just arrived.

03:06.619 --> 03:09.588
See, I,ve organized them
from mildest to boldest.

03:09.589 --> 03:11.590
And in this direction, from youngest-

03:13.726 --> 03:16.726
to most mature-

03:17.030 --> 03:19.031
I am honored, sir.

03:19.032 --> 03:22.032
Now, I found these small leather journals,
so we can record our impressions as we go.

03:25.038 --> 03:28.038
Cheese makes me feel better.

03:33.179 --> 03:35.347
Can't have nice things!

03:35.348 --> 03:37.716
I know what,ll
cheer you up, honey.

03:37.717 --> 03:40.717
The community theater's putting
on a play about Abraham Lincoln.

03:40.787 --> 03:43.787
Ah, Abe Lincoln, the first Republican,
pure and perfect.

03:47.393 --> 03:50.393
Clorox bleach
gets your whites white.

03:51.164 --> 03:54.164
Test drive the new
Lincoln Continental.

03:56.236 --> 03:59.236
The McRib is back!

04:00.173 --> 04:03.173
Aren't we all just slaves?

04:08.047 --> 04:11.047
- That was an abomination.
- Lincoln has been assassinated in the theater twice.

04:12.719 --> 04:15.719
Wow, that's nice, Steve.
The G.O.P. has lost its way, Francine.

04:16.723 --> 04:18.724
And as a proud member,
it's up to me-

04:18.725 --> 04:20.726
Really, Steve, very nice
turn of phrase back there-

04:20.726 --> 04:23.727
to help us get back to our roots
for the future Republicans of this country.

04:29.168 --> 04:32.168
- Francine, wake up!
- What's wrong? Is one of the children dead?

04:32.305 --> 04:35.305
I know how I,m gonna show Steve
what it means to be a true Republican-

04:35.842 --> 04:37.976
by doing my own play
about Abraham Lincoln.

04:37.977 --> 04:40.212
I,m gonna write the play
from the point of view...

04:40.213 --> 04:42.981
of one of Lincoln's
greatest admirers.

04:42.982 --> 04:45.982
Did you know Abe had a personal bodyguard
named Captain David Derick son?

04:47.954 --> 04:50.954
They traveled together,
shared secrets, hopes, dreams.

04:51.557 --> 04:54.557
See, I've set the play during the winter of1863.

04:55.495 --> 04:58.495
- That's when Abe and David really grew close.
- Hey you two.

04:58.498 --> 05:00.966
Don't forget our soiree on the third.

05:00.967 --> 05:03.201
But, and we mean it,
don't bring a thing.

05:03.202 --> 05:06.104
Especially not a chilled bottle
of Clos du Bois Chardonnay.

05:06.105 --> 05:09.105
You,re so bad. Isn't that right,
Heath Ledger? Isn't Poppy bad?

05:10.276 --> 05:13.276
Greg and Terry-
handsome, successful, eligible bachelors.

05:14.147 --> 05:17.147
We really should set them up with some
nice women. Hey, how about your sister?

05:17.250 --> 05:19.885
Uh, I don't think so, Stan.

05:19.886 --> 05:22.788
Yeah, you,re right.
She's too hot. God, is Gwen hot.

05:22.789 --> 05:24.856
And slender. God.

05:24.857 --> 05:27.059
And that dress she wore
at our wedding.

05:27.060 --> 05:30.060
Oh, I have never seen her
more beautiful than on that day.

05:33.132 --> 05:36.132
It's200a. m.
We'rein Mr. Lincoln's bedroom.

05:36.602 --> 05:39.602
He's invited me, his bodyguard,
David Derickson, to sleep over... again.

05:42.175 --> 05:45.175
I,m sorry Mary Todd
takes so many long trips, Mr. Lincoln.

05:46.179 --> 05:49.179
Hmm? Okay, Abe.

05:51.918 --> 05:54.820
This log cabin will represent
the strong roots...

05:54.821 --> 05:57.289
of the Republican Party
you founded, Mr. Lincoln.

05:57.290 --> 06:00.290
God, you have such muscles.

06:03.796 --> 06:06.231
I think "four score...
sounds better than 80...

06:06.232 --> 06:08.700
more... theatrical.

06:13.573 --> 06:16.573
I was his bodyguard,
and he was my everything.

06:18.911 --> 06:21.911
Let me take you home,
Abe, one last time.

06:33.493 --> 06:35.494
- You,re an inspiration.
- I love you.

06:37.497 --> 06:39.965
See, Son?
People are desperate for a return...

06:39.966 --> 06:42.367
to good old-fashioned
conservative values.

06:42.368 --> 06:45.368
Fantastic performance, Stan.
This is BretandJason.

06:45.671 --> 06:48.671
- We,re members ofthe Log Cabin Republicans.
- Log Cabin?

06:49.142 --> 06:52.142
Our group is based on the founding
principles Abe Lincoln stood for.

06:52.311 --> 06:55.311
- We,re die-hard Republicans.
- With dyed-to-match shoes.

06:55.715 --> 06:58.715
I don't get it.

06:59.285 --> 07:01.686
Our group is speaking
at the R.N.C. this year...

07:01.687 --> 07:04.423
and after seeing you
as Lincoln's "special friend......

07:04.424 --> 07:06.725
well, we thinkyou encapsulate
what we,re all about.

07:06.726 --> 07:08.727
Would you consider
speaking on our behalf?

07:08.728 --> 07:11.728
Me? Speaking at the R.N.C.?

07:11.864 --> 07:13.865
Why, it's a dream come true.

07:13.866 --> 07:16.866
Excellent. We,re having a mixer
at our headquarters later tonight.

07:17.036 --> 07:20.036
You know, nothing fancy. Wejust
threw it together at the last minute.

07:28.714 --> 07:30.949
Mmm. Oh, my God.
What is this?

07:30.950 --> 07:33.950
A Cueryo cosmotinian.
I first had one on Fire Island.

07:34.587 --> 07:37.587
A whole island made of fire?
How manly.

07:38.658 --> 07:41.126
So, Stan, what do you think
of our humble organization?

07:41.127 --> 07:44.127
Fantastic. Why didn't I know about
the Log Cabin Republicans before?

07:45.531 --> 07:48.531
There you are. Stan, I,d like you
to meet my partner, Tino.

07:48.968 --> 07:51.968
Partner? What are you guys, cops?
Partners in a law firm?

07:52.205 --> 07:55.006
Tennis partners? Golf partners?
Synchronized swimmers?

07:55.007 --> 07:58.007
You might say
I,m Captain Derickson to his Lincoln.

07:58.244 --> 08:01.244
Celine Dion.

08:09.689 --> 08:12.689
Gays! They,re everywhere!

08:13.493 --> 08:16.493
I am a pilgrim
in an unholy land!

08:23.603 --> 08:26.404
Greg, act casual. Get your stuff
and meet me outside.

08:26.405 --> 08:29.140
- What? Why?
- There are gays here.

08:29.141 --> 08:31.142
Uh, Stan, I,m gay.

08:31.143 --> 08:34.143
What? Does Terry know?
Oh, poor, straight Terry.

08:35.081 --> 08:37.115
Terry's gay too.
He's my boyfriend.

08:37.116 --> 08:40.116
I thought you knew. The Log Cabin
Republicans are a gay group.

08:40.253 --> 08:43.253
A gay group?

08:43.289 --> 08:46.289
Oh-Oh, my God. Y-You don't think-
Look, I,m straight.

08:46.692 --> 08:49.661
I mean, yes, Francine's bat cave
grosses me out every now and then, but-

08:49.662 --> 08:52.662
We know you,re not gay, Stan.
But we,ve always maintained Lincoln was.

08:52.732 --> 08:54.733
And the way you portrayed him
with his boyfriend-

08:54.734 --> 08:57.235
Wait. You got gay
from Lincoln Lover?

08:57.236 --> 09:00.171
You-You people
really grasp at straws.

09:00.172 --> 09:03.172
Look, this is ridiculous.
How can you be gay and Republican?

09:03.409 --> 09:06.409
Ugh, these preconceived notions
about gay people.

09:07.013 --> 09:10.013
It's time to dispel that stereotype...
through a lavish musical number.

09:11.517 --> 09:14.517
Hit it,Joshua.

11:02.294 --> 11:05.294
My God, where did you
get that confetti?

11:09.201 --> 11:11.603
But you told me we hate the gays.

11:11.604 --> 11:14.406
That was A: before I knew
they came in Republican form...

11:14.407 --> 11:16.875
and B: before they
cut and styled my hair.

11:16.876 --> 11:19.876
How can you associate with them? You said
they,re tearing apart the fabric of this nation.

11:21.380 --> 11:23.815
Steve, don't worry.
I,m just spending time with them...

11:23.816 --> 11:25.817
because they,re letting me
speak at the convention.

11:25.818 --> 11:28.818
- So they,re not gonna turn you gay?
- Of course not, kiddo.

11:29.388 --> 11:31.856
Now, I don't wanna be late
for my first Log Cabin meeting.

11:31.857 --> 11:34.857
"Byesies....
I mean, "byesies....

11:47.406 --> 11:50.406
Wow, front row Clay Aiken.
This is the best meeting ever.

11:53.779 --> 11:56.081
Good night, guys.
Oh, look who stopped kissing.

11:56.082 --> 11:58.083
Have fun.

11:58.084 --> 12:01.084
- Greg?
- Terry, I thought you were at bonsai topiary class.

12:01.454 --> 12:04.454
Heath Ledger has a head cold.
That's why he's in his sweater.

12:04.557 --> 12:07.557
You took a limo with Stan to do a report
on the new otters at the zoo?

12:08.094 --> 12:10.762
Otters? We,re coming from
our gay Republican meeting.

12:10.763 --> 12:12.797
You,re a... Republican?

12:12.798 --> 12:15.233
- Honey, I can explain.
- Oh, you didn't know?

12:15.234 --> 12:18.234
Oh, that's- that's funny. Gay couples lie
to each other just like regular couples.

12:19.305 --> 12:22.305
- Well, bye.
- All these years you,ve been a Republican?

12:22.708 --> 12:25.708
- Listen, calm down. We,ll go inside and-
- I am not calming down.

12:26.278 --> 12:29.278
For God's sake, Republicans are the people
who say we can't get married.

12:29.849 --> 12:32.849
And right now, I want to send them a big
thank-you basket from the Body Factory.

12:36.155 --> 12:39.155
Just three more days until
I get to speak at the R.N.C. Sip?

12:42.528 --> 12:45.528
Oh, my God. What is this and
how can I replace my blood with it?

12:46.165 --> 12:49.134
It's a Cueryo cosmotinian.

12:49.135 --> 12:52.135
- Roger, are you crying?
- Tears of joy, Stan. Tears of joy.

12:53.472 --> 12:56.472
Stan, thank you for the beautiful roses
you left on my nightstand.

12:57.710 --> 13:00.111
Oh, no, honey. They,re not for you.
Those are ambient roses.

13:00.112 --> 13:02.113
They,re a present
for the bedroom.

13:02.114 --> 13:05.114
Oh, that was... nice of you.

13:05.284 --> 13:07.986
I don't know what you,ve done,
Stan, but kudos.

13:07.987 --> 13:10.588
No notes for you.

13:10.589 --> 13:13.589
Hello, Dad. Wow,
that's a nice manicure you have.

13:13.859 --> 13:16.859
- Why, thank you, Esteban.
- Aha! I knew it!

13:17.163 --> 13:19.964
The gays got to you
with their insidious ways.

13:19.965 --> 13:22.965
I,m not gay. I,m just
enjoying the lifestyle.

13:23.068 --> 13:26.037
- Now don't squint your eyes. You,ll get crow's-feet.
- There it is again.

13:26.038 --> 13:28.706
This has gone way beyond
you speaking at the convention.

13:28.707 --> 13:31.707
And I,m not gonna let them have you.
This isn't over.

13:32.178 --> 13:35.178
Don'you tell me you voted
for he who shall not be named!

13:35.915 --> 13:38.915
- Look, the war was inevitable. Freedom isn't free.
- Are you kidding me?

13:41.987 --> 13:44.987
- Hi, I,m here for the Log Cabin Republicans sunset cruise.
- Whoa, whoa. Straight check.

13:47.393 --> 13:50.393
Who is the only person to win an Oscar,
an Emmy and a Tony in the same year?

13:51.931 --> 13:54.931
Uh, the guy from Monk?

13:58.370 --> 14:00.805
If you get on that boat with those Republicans...

14:00.806 --> 14:03.806
- then it's open season while you,re gone.
- Fine.

14:04.543 --> 14:06.945
Mary Martin, Cathy Rigby,
Sandy Duncan, Mary Lou Retton.

14:06.946 --> 14:09.714
Wow. All the Peter Pans,
and in order.

14:12.251 --> 14:14.252
Bret, Bret.
Tell this guy I,m okay.

14:14.253 --> 14:16.554
Tell him you can't have
a Log Cabin event without me.

14:16.555 --> 14:19.157
- You,re not invited, Stan.
- What? Why?

14:19.158 --> 14:22.158
Because your son stopped by
the office today and dropped off this.

14:22.528 --> 14:25.528
So? It's me and hate monger Pat Robertson.
I met him at some party.

14:27.833 --> 14:30.768
I was just walking through.

14:30.769 --> 14:33.769
It was just a momentary
lapse of judgment.

14:34.073 --> 14:35.740
My mind's a blank.

14:35.741 --> 14:38.176
Not only are you not
invited on the cruise...

14:38.177 --> 14:41.177
but you,re clearly not the kind of person
we want speaking for us at the convention.

14:41.714 --> 14:44.714
But I am! I,ve changed!
You gotta believe me!

14:51.123 --> 14:53.791
Well, Steve,
they kicked me out.

14:53.792 --> 14:55.994
They,re not letting me
speak at the R.N.C.

14:55.995 --> 14:58.329
I saved your soul, Dad.

14:58.330 --> 15:01.330
You can thank me when we,re duck hunting
with Strom Thurmond in heaven.

15:01.567 --> 15:04.469
- You didn't belong with those people.
- You,re right, Son.

15:04.470 --> 15:06.804
I love their world,
but I,m not one of them.

15:06.805 --> 15:09.805
- You can't live a gay lifestyle without being gay.
- Of coures you can't.

15:11.210 --> 15:14.210
Which is why I,ve decided to have sex with a man.

15:19.485 --> 15:21.686
You wanna have sex with a man?

15:21.687 --> 15:24.687
Francine, that's the fourth time you,ve
said that. What doesn't make sense to you?

15:24.857 --> 15:27.158
We,re married.
I,m your wife.

15:27.159 --> 15:29.827
God, you can be so selfish.
I,m doing this for me.

15:29.828 --> 15:32.063
- This can't be happening.
- Steve.

15:32.064 --> 15:35.064
Stay away from me!
I don't wanna catch your gay!

15:35.601 --> 15:38.601
It's very simple. If I become gay...

15:39.171 --> 15:42.140
the Log Cabin Republicans
will know I,m one of them.

15:42.141 --> 15:45.141
They,ll let me speak at the R.N.C.
So I,m making this choice.

15:46.011 --> 15:49.011
- But where does that leave me?
- In the best position of all-

15:49.548 --> 15:52.548
with all the other women
who can't make it with a straight guy.

15:52.551 --> 15:55.551
The role of a hag.

15:59.391 --> 16:02.391
I,m not that great at songs yet, but once
I poke a guy, I,ll be a regular Sondheim.

16:05.264 --> 16:07.532
Terry, I heard you tell Greg
that it's open season...

16:07.533 --> 16:09.734
and you,re the only gay guy
I know who's still in town.

16:09.735 --> 16:12.735
So I was hoping I could take you to dinner
and then afterwards have sex with you.

16:13.472 --> 16:16.472
If my terminology is correct,
I,m a power top. I,ll get my jacket.

16:23.148 --> 16:26.148
You know, I did some research on the Internet
about the whole gay club scene.

16:26.885 --> 16:29.754
Unfortunately, I couldn't find
any crystallized methamphetamines...

16:29.755 --> 16:32.755
but maybe we can make do
with some Michelob Ultra and diet pills.

16:32.825 --> 16:35.825
Uh, yeah. Why don't wejust have some wine
instead? That should break the ice.

16:36.862 --> 16:39.063
You,re the professional.

16:52.311 --> 16:55.113
God, that was so tight.

16:55.114 --> 16:57.749
That's what the kids say, right?
"Tight... as in "good....

16:57.750 --> 17:00.750
- Your dancing was good. It was tight.
- Glad you liked it.

17:01.587 --> 17:04.188
Well, I guess it's time to have sex.

17:04.189 --> 17:06.190
I have to admit, I,m a little nervous.

17:06.191 --> 17:09.191
Let's just start slow.

17:22.107 --> 17:24.108
- What's wrong, Stan?
- It's weird.

17:24.108 --> 17:26.444
I don't feel anything.
You must not be doing it right.

17:26.444 --> 17:29.147
I,ve been doing it right
since J.v. football.

17:29.148 --> 17:31.682
I don't get this. I danced to Madonna.

17:31.683 --> 17:34.018
I drank merlot.
How come I don't feel anything?

17:34.019 --> 17:37.019
I hate to break it to you, Stan,
but I thinkyou,re straight.

17:37.756 --> 17:40.258
What did you call me?
I,m gay, damn it!

17:40.259 --> 17:43.259
This is my choice.
I wanna be gay. I choose to be gay.

17:43.796 --> 17:46.531
Either you are or you,re not.
It's not a choice.

17:46.532 --> 17:49.033
- It's- It's not?
- No.

17:49.034 --> 17:52.034
Huh, I always thought it was. So why am I
in bed with you with my shirt off?

17:53.472 --> 17:56.472
Because Greg is a bastard!

17:56.675 --> 17:59.675
There, there.
Hey, I know what,ll cheer you up.

18:00.045 --> 18:02.080
I have a perfectly good
hag in my kitchen.

18:02.081 --> 18:05.081
- Want me to get her?
- That would be great.

18:07.052 --> 18:10.052
Good to have you back, Dad.

18:10.255 --> 18:12.256
Apparently,
this is where I belong.

18:12.257 --> 18:15.257
Damn right.
Here they come.

18:16.995 --> 18:19.995
Come on. Let's keep this convention pure.
Just like you taught me.

18:25.604 --> 18:28.604
What is the meaning of this?
We are invited guests ofthe R.N.C.

18:29.408 --> 18:32.408
You,re invited guests ofthe devil!

18:33.412 --> 18:36.412
Stan!Nancy Callieop has been kicked out
ofthe Langley Conservatives.

18:36.515 --> 18:39.515
- What? Why?
- Wejust found out her second car is a Prius.

18:39.651 --> 18:41.652
Terrorist!

18:41.653 --> 18:44.653
Stan, will you speak on our behalf?

18:45.491 --> 18:48.491
And now, representing
the Langley Conservatives, Stan Smith.

18:52.097 --> 18:55.097
Two, four, six. eight.
Gays are bad God is straight.

18:58.370 --> 19:01.370
My fellow Republicans,
last night I kissed a man named Terry.

19:02.474 --> 19:05.474
Greg, you were on break at the time.

19:05.978 --> 19:08.978
And I learned something.
We,re wrong about gays. I was wrong.

19:10.482 --> 19:13.251
And I taught my boy wrong.

19:13.252 --> 19:16.120
It turns out that being gay
is not a choice.

19:16.121 --> 19:19.121
It's true. Believe me. I tried and it didn't work.

19:22.427 --> 19:25.427
The Log Cabin delegates trying to get in
tonight didn't choose to be gay...

19:25.931 --> 19:28.199
but they did choose
to be Republicans.

19:28.200 --> 19:30.635
Even though, as Republicans,
we used bashing them...

19:30.636 --> 19:33.636
as the backbone of our last presidential
election, they,re still sticking with us.

19:34.039 --> 19:37.039
By God, these people love America
as much as they love brunch.

19:38.243 --> 19:41.243
You know what else is a choice?
Being a Democrat.

19:41.446 --> 19:44.446
Democrats weren't born Democrats.

19:45.117 --> 19:48.117
They chose to be Democrats.
I,m not telling you to stop hating.

19:48.820 --> 19:51.289
I just want you to hate
where hate deserves.

19:51.290 --> 19:54.290
Hating gays is hate we could
be using on the Democrats.

19:56.795 --> 19:59.397
We shouldn't
discriminate against gays.

19:59.398 --> 20:01.799
We should get more of them
to be Republicans.

20:01.800 --> 20:04.800
They,re supporting the economy by buying
high-end appliances and teacup poodles.

20:06.038 --> 20:09.038
Do you want manufacturers of
super tight T-shirts to go out of business?

20:09.541 --> 20:11.275
No!

20:11.276 --> 20:14.276
- Would you forsake Socrates, Plato and Grandpa Walton?
- No!

20:16.248 --> 20:19.248
There's room for everyone.
We all belong in the G.O.P.

20:19.718 --> 20:22.718
So come on, David Geffen. Get on board,
Nathan Lane. Come on,Johnny Depp.

20:24.423 --> 20:27.423
- Really? You would,ve thought
with the tiny glasses.

20:27.926 --> 20:30.926
So come on, L.A. Sparks. Come on,
halfthe population of Palm Springs.

20:32.231 --> 20:35.231
Oh, who are we kidding?
Come on, all of Palm Springs.

20:35.267 --> 20:37.935
Come on, Anne Heche,
you confused son of a bitch.

20:37.936 --> 20:40.936
Come under the big tent.
The Grand Old Party just got grander.

20:44.509 --> 20:47.509
In the words ofthe founding father
ofthe Republican party, Abraham Lincoln...

20:49.314 --> 20:52.314
"A house divided against itself
cannot stand....

20:52.651 --> 20:55.651
And that house, my friends,
will be re-surfaced with an aged lime wash...

20:56.421 --> 20:58.422
and flipped for a profit!

21:04.329 --> 21:07.329
- Dad!
- Mmm.

21:07.599 --> 21:09.600
This doesn't make me gay, does it, Dad?

21:09.601 --> 21:12.601
Only if you get a boner, Son.
Only if you get a boner.
