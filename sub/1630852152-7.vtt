00:27.194 --> 00:29.363
Hey! What are you doing?

00:32.199 --> 00:33.200
Calm down.

00:33.576 --> 00:35.286
Calm down. Everything's okay.

00:39.749 --> 00:43.085
Calm down. I'm right here.

00:43.753 --> 00:45.588
No, no. Calm down.

00:47.256 --> 00:48.716
It's okay.

02:15.636 --> 02:16.345
<i>The sea cures it all.</i>

02:17.263 --> 02:18.681
<i>KannaLab was born by the sea.</i>

02:20.724 --> 02:22.101
Wasn't it in BogotÃ¡?

02:22.142 --> 02:24.603
You fell in love with the person

02:24.645 --> 02:25.813
who can hurt us the most.

02:27.606 --> 02:29.733
<i>What's stopping you
from going to Thailand?</i>

02:29.775 --> 02:31.402
<i>Leaving would be the
easy way out.</i>

02:33.320 --> 02:34.947
I've never had any
feelings for Ignacio.

02:39.827 --> 02:41.203
<i>I've never lied to Lola.</i>

02:43.622 --> 02:44.498
BODY OF ISRAELI ASSAF BEN AMIR
FOUND AT TAYRONA

02:45.624 --> 02:47.710
<i>She's been using you
since day one.</i>

02:47.751 --> 02:48.752
Lola wouldn't do that.

02:51.672 --> 02:53.173
<i>We have to call an ambulance.</i>

02:53.215 --> 02:55.676
<i>If they connect us to this shit,
they'll use my family name</i>

02:55.718 --> 02:58.095
<i>-and</i> <i>talk</i> <i>about</i> <i>it</i> <i>in</i> <i>the</i> <i>papers!
- We</i> <i>didn't</i> <i>do</i> <i>anything,</i> <i>Nacho!</i>

03:32.963 --> 03:34.715
I didn't hear you come
in last night.

03:35.299 --> 03:36.634
I just got here.

03:38.510 --> 03:40.596
You can't spend your
life partying.

03:42.056 --> 03:44.433
I wasn't partying.
I was solving some issues

03:44.475 --> 03:46.310
with the plants in
the greenhouse.

03:47.394 --> 03:49.146
I'm gonna shower and
I'll be back.

03:49.188 --> 03:50.439
Were you with Mariana?

03:52.358 --> 03:54.234
Yes, I was with Mariana.
She's my partner.

03:54.860 --> 03:55.945
What about her?

03:57.404 --> 03:59.573
Nothing, nothing at all.

03:59.615 --> 04:00.824
I was just curious.

04:02.409 --> 04:04.954
If you wanna say something,
quit the bullshit and say it.

04:07.498 --> 04:11.627
You think you're helping that girl,
but it's the opposite.

04:12.586 --> 04:14.380
Now I'm a bad influence?

04:16.215 --> 04:17.466
I didn't say that.

04:17.508 --> 04:18.926
So what are you saying?

04:18.968 --> 04:19.969
You must let her go.

04:20.928 --> 04:25.599
Marriage is hard enough without
dealing with a ghost from the past.

04:26.642 --> 04:28.268
A ghost from the past?

04:30.312 --> 04:31.480
Yes.

04:31.522 --> 04:33.732
That's what you are.
A ghost from the past.

04:33.774 --> 04:35.192
Whether you like it or not.

04:35.234 --> 04:37.444
And ghosts only cause harm.

05:14.189 --> 05:15.149
Hi.

05:17.526 --> 05:18.610
Happy birthday.

05:22.364 --> 05:24.116
Happy birthday to all of this,
too.

05:25.701 --> 05:27.119
Why don't you go rest?

05:28.954 --> 05:30.664
Lucas is coming back
from his trip,

05:31.373 --> 05:32.291
and...

05:33.584 --> 05:36.253
I don't know if I wanna be there
when he arrives.

05:36.295 --> 05:39.256
You have to go home
at some point, no?

05:40.758 --> 05:41.717
Hm...

05:45.054 --> 05:46.138
Hey...

05:48.849 --> 05:51.310
Good job with that male plant.

05:51.351 --> 05:52.478
You worked it out.

05:53.687 --> 05:55.773
We never would've found that
without you.

05:58.984 --> 06:01.111
- I finally got something right.
- Don't say that, Fefe.

06:02.571 --> 06:04.782
You know none of this
would've happened without you.

06:06.033 --> 06:08.452
And now it's my fault
it's going to hell.

06:08.494 --> 06:09.411
What? No.

06:10.496 --> 06:12.414
Don't think like that.
Not at all.

06:13.540 --> 06:15.000
There's no guilt here.
No one to blame.

06:16.126 --> 06:17.211
The three of us
decided to go there.

06:18.420 --> 06:20.339
The three of us decided
to get into this.

06:20.380 --> 06:21.757
Stop trying to make
me feel good.

06:21.799 --> 06:23.717
Tell me it's working out,
please.

06:28.639 --> 06:29.848
Have you heard from Ignacio?

06:36.605 --> 06:39.399
I feel like I have a rope
tied around my neck,

06:39.441 --> 06:42.194
waiting for the Earth to open up
beneath me.

06:43.612 --> 06:44.905
Hey, look at me.

06:48.367 --> 06:49.618
I will get you out of this.

06:52.037 --> 06:54.498
Everything will be okay.
I swear.

07:09.429 --> 07:11.265
- How's it going, Gabo?
- Good.

07:11.306 --> 07:13.976
The first group is on break.
The rest are in the greenhouse.

07:14.017 --> 07:15.936
Perfect. Have you found
more male plants?

07:15.978 --> 07:18.188
No, we just have the
one you found.

07:18.230 --> 07:20.649
Are you sure? You know we're up
against the clock.

07:20.691 --> 07:22.776
Don't worry, I inspected
the whole place.

07:23.569 --> 07:25.654
Okay. Anything flowering?

07:25.696 --> 07:27.114
No, everything is good.

07:28.031 --> 07:29.992
Go rest, this has been tough.

07:30.033 --> 07:30.701
Hm... Not yet.

07:31.910 --> 07:34.204
Felix asked me to do an
extraction test

07:34.246 --> 07:37.166
to make sure everything's fine,
so I wanna do that before I go.

07:37.916 --> 07:40.210
Perfect. Thanks, Gabo.

07:45.340 --> 07:47.217
Finally, you show up,
Sherlock Holmes.

07:47.259 --> 07:49.511
Couldn't you reference something
more modern?

07:49.553 --> 07:51.346
Did you find anything out,
yes or no?

07:51.388 --> 07:53.182
Yes, I went into
Lola's computer.

07:53.807 --> 07:54.641
And?

07:55.267 --> 07:56.101
Nothing.

07:56.768 --> 07:58.103
She found nothing.

07:58.145 --> 07:59.855
<i>She found nothing?
Or you haven't looked hard?</i>

08:00.939 --> 08:02.399
I went through her
whole computer.

08:02.441 --> 08:05.360
Did you check the cookies?
The temporary internet files?

08:05.402 --> 08:07.988
Should I get Edward Snowden
to join this call?

08:08.864 --> 08:10.407
I'm serious, Ignacio.

08:10.449 --> 08:12.409
It was exactly what I told you.

08:12.451 --> 08:15.204
- She's just writing profiles on us.
- Okay.

08:15.245 --> 08:18.165
Did you talk to your friend at the
paper? Maybe she told him something.

08:18.207 --> 08:20.792
Enough with the coffee. You're
like a stockbroker on coke.

08:20.834 --> 08:21.835
I don't drink coffee.

08:22.711 --> 08:25.047
<i>Then</i> <i>relax.</i> <i>Lie</i> <i>down</i> <i>before</i> <i>you</i> <i>have
a</i> <i>heart</i> <i>attack.</i>

08:25.088 --> 08:26.089
<i>Lola knows nothing.</i>

08:26.423 --> 08:28.675
Then why the fuck
did she go into my office?

08:32.012 --> 08:34.890
She wanted to get your contacts.

08:34.932 --> 08:36.475
<i>My contacts?</i>

08:36.516 --> 08:39.228
Yes, she wanted to get emails
from people she can't contact.

08:39.269 --> 08:40.229
You know how journalists are.

08:42.522 --> 08:45.108
No. That makes no sense.

08:45.150 --> 08:47.486
I told you, Lola's incapable
of investigating us.

08:48.403 --> 08:49.821
<i>She has nothing incriminating.</i>

08:50.906 --> 08:51.782
Nothing.

08:52.449 --> 08:53.158
Do me a favor.

08:54.493 --> 08:56.703
Send me everything she copied
from my computer.

08:56.745 --> 08:58.997
Mariana, it's over.
I'm not sending you anything.

08:59.039 --> 09:00.415
I'm erasing everything here.

09:01.792 --> 09:03.919
Instead, tell me about
the mother plant.

09:05.587 --> 09:07.172
Susana stole it.

09:07.214 --> 09:08.173
Why Susana?

09:08.924 --> 09:09.633
Mm.

09:11.009 --> 09:13.553
It was a setup to sabotage
the other mother plants.

09:13.595 --> 09:15.430
She's working for somebody,
of course.

09:15.889 --> 09:16.932
Who?

09:18.016 --> 09:19.351
I don't know yet.

09:20.352 --> 09:21.353
Alright.

09:21.979 --> 09:24.731
Now the priority is Ilana's delivery
and paying Teo.

09:25.148 --> 09:26.233
Okay?

09:27.317 --> 09:28.694
And go to bed.

09:33.615 --> 09:38.704
BODY OF ISRAELI ASSAF BEN AMIR
FOUND IN TAYRONA

10:16.325 --> 10:17.367
- What's up?
- What's up?

10:17.409 --> 10:18.827
How are you doing?

10:18.869 --> 10:20.454
Do you remember what I told you,

10:20.495 --> 10:21.538
that the higher you go,
the harder you fall?

10:23.623 --> 10:27.753
Well, the roles have been reversed. I
have half the country's eyes on me, bro.

10:27.794 --> 10:28.795
Why?

10:29.588 --> 10:32.591
Because of the article we published
on the Korean concessionary.

10:32.632 --> 10:34.176
The one on money laundering.
You didn't read it?

10:34.718 --> 10:36.011
No, I didn't.

10:36.053 --> 10:38.930
The DA took the article
as a public condemnation.

10:38.972 --> 10:40.682
It started some real
fucking shit.

10:40.724 --> 10:43.685
They interrogated me
as the voice of the prosecution.

10:43.727 --> 10:44.770
Prosecutor.

10:45.604 --> 10:46.605
It's the same shit.

10:47.481 --> 10:51.109
What matters here is they imprisoned
the three owners of the company.

10:51.151 --> 10:53.528
This morning they went
to one of those jerk's houses.

10:53.570 --> 10:55.405
That shithead ran
down the street

10:55.447 --> 10:56.490
in his underwear, dude.

10:57.783 --> 10:59.701
The police caught him
outside a supermarket...

10:59.743 --> 11:02.079
But this shit involved a
helicopter and everything.

11:03.246 --> 11:04.748
You didn't see anything, Nacho?

11:04.790 --> 11:06.124
It was all over the news, bro.

11:07.584 --> 11:09.795
And all this because of an article
you published?

11:09.836 --> 11:11.463
Of course, you should know.

11:20.013 --> 11:22.349
What's the matter with you?
Why so quiet?

11:23.225 --> 11:25.185
You should be happy for me.

11:25.227 --> 11:27.437
Most newspapers don't put
people in jail.

11:29.898 --> 11:31.274
I'm looking for Lola.

11:32.651 --> 11:34.861
Lola? What the hell do
you need Lola for?

11:36.154 --> 11:37.280
For something
on the article she's writing.

11:39.032 --> 11:43.036
Man, you're the first person in
the world who's looked for Lola.

11:43.954 --> 11:45.622
Most try to get away from her.

11:46.832 --> 11:47.541
So do you know where she is?

11:48.834 --> 11:51.753
No, but... Dude, I can give
you her number...

11:51.795 --> 11:54.005
No, I have it. The thing is she's
not picking up.

11:55.674 --> 11:58.885
Yes. It's weird, she didn't show up
to a meeting this morning.

11:59.970 --> 12:00.929
Doll face...

12:00.971 --> 12:01.972
What's up?

12:02.764 --> 12:05.308
Has she showed you anything
that she's writing about us?

12:06.435 --> 12:09.521
No. She did tell me it
was explosive.

12:09.563 --> 12:12.023
Explosive enough for
the front cover.

12:12.065 --> 12:14.151
As soon as she sends it over,
I'll let you know.

12:14.192 --> 12:15.819
Make yourself at home, kiddo.

12:15.861 --> 12:17.028
I'm going to court.

12:18.697 --> 12:20.198
You look so cute.

12:38.592 --> 12:41.386
That's what I heard.
He slipped in the shower.

12:41.428 --> 12:43.221
Dislocated his shoulder,
apparently.

12:43.263 --> 12:45.765
His shoulder? That's bullshit.

12:45.807 --> 12:49.102
I play golf with his doctor.
He broke a rib.

12:49.144 --> 12:51.438
This place is really nice. Yes.

12:51.480 --> 12:52.397
Really nice.

12:52.439 --> 12:54.232
That old guy is falling apart.

12:55.734 --> 12:57.402
He's on his way out.

12:57.444 --> 13:00.822
His son's in talks with the Chinese.
He'll take the whole market.

13:01.823 --> 13:03.033
- Wait here.
- It's in the city,

13:03.074 --> 13:04.701
but it doesn't feel
like the city.

13:04.743 --> 13:06.661
Right, and who recommended it?

13:06.703 --> 13:10.040
My father-in-law.
Yeah, they say the food is good.

13:10.081 --> 13:11.458
We'll see.

13:11.500 --> 13:14.252
You're improving your
culinary taste.

13:14.294 --> 13:15.295
Virgilio, what's up?

13:16.546 --> 13:18.548
We're here because of your
recommendation.

13:19.883 --> 13:21.843
Get the <i>osso bucco.
</i> Best thing on the menu.

13:22.719 --> 13:24.763
Alright, I'll consider that.

13:25.639 --> 13:27.224
Can we speak for a minute?

13:28.517 --> 13:31.311
- We're just about to--
- Just five minutes.

13:34.356 --> 13:36.107
Speaking of the devil.

13:39.486 --> 13:42.989
If it's about the contracts,
Samantha is already talking

13:43.031 --> 13:45.325
- with the lawyers.
- The contracts will have to wait.

13:46.034 --> 13:47.077
What do you mean?

13:48.578 --> 13:50.580
We had already closed that deal.

13:52.040 --> 13:53.458
Closed... Hm!

13:55.043 --> 13:57.879
You better tell your people
to cancel the equipment order.

13:59.506 --> 14:01.216
No. Virgilio...

14:02.008 --> 14:03.009
We had a deal.

14:04.135 --> 14:06.721
If this deal doesn't work out,
the company will cut my head off.

14:06.763 --> 14:10.016
You wouldn't be the first person
sent to the guillotine by his wife.

14:12.018 --> 14:13.728
What do you mean? What does
Mariana have to do with this?

14:14.813 --> 14:16.648
Hasn't she told you
what's going on?

14:18.316 --> 14:21.820
Well... Now we know who wears
the pants in that house.

14:23.363 --> 14:24.823
Mariana...

14:24.864 --> 14:28.410
is about to bankrupt RosalÃ­a.

14:28.451 --> 14:31.538
Because she doesn't want to close
some deals with us.

14:33.248 --> 14:33.873
Listen, Lucas.

14:34.958 --> 14:36.668
If you want to raise
my grandkids,

14:36.710 --> 14:39.337
you should know Mariana's
tantrums are not convenient

14:40.088 --> 14:42.173
at this point in life.

14:42.215 --> 14:43.633
As for me? Well...

14:44.759 --> 14:47.345
I can do business with
other companies.

14:51.057 --> 14:53.101
Excuse me, here's your check.

14:53.935 --> 14:55.145
Give it to him.

14:55.186 --> 14:57.480
He's going to pay for
all of this.

15:16.333 --> 15:17.667
So? Should we have another one?

15:18.835 --> 15:20.754
Let's take advantage, our
bill is at zero.

15:21.713 --> 15:23.048
Alright.

17:07.193 --> 17:10.071
So you want me to investigate
your girlfriend.

17:10.113 --> 17:12.615
She's not my girlfriend.
She's a journalist.

17:12.657 --> 17:15.285
Ha, just this morning
I was watching

17:15.326 --> 17:17.662
a Mexican show about...

17:17.704 --> 17:19.831
- the Virgin's rose.
- Not now, Marlon.

17:19.873 --> 17:22.917
Listen, listen.
It was about a guy who...

17:22.959 --> 17:25.628
got so obsessed over his girlfriend,
you know?

17:25.670 --> 17:27.714
Because she was the one
who left him.

17:27.756 --> 17:31.634
So he started following her
to work, to the supermarket...

17:31.676 --> 17:33.970
The only thing he didn't do

17:34.012 --> 17:36.723
was follow her to the bathroom
and watch her shit.

17:39.976 --> 17:43.438
Anyway.
The story is

17:43.480 --> 17:47.066
he began asking the Virgin
to bring his girlfriend back.

17:47.108 --> 17:50.528
I don't have time right now to hear
about Mexican soap operas and shit.

17:51.821 --> 17:53.364
This is not about me.

17:53.406 --> 17:54.824
It's corporate espionage.

17:54.866 --> 17:57.285
- Corporate espionage?
- Yes.

17:57.327 --> 17:59.746
We believe she stole information
from our company.

17:59.788 --> 18:02.457
Can you find out if she's talking
to the police?

18:04.626 --> 18:07.337
If that's the case,
why would she go to the police?

18:07.378 --> 18:08.505
Can you find out or not?

18:09.923 --> 18:10.924
Yes, sure.

18:11.841 --> 18:14.594
I have friends who can
investigate and won't talk.

18:14.636 --> 18:17.806
But be careful.
Don't mention me or the company.

18:19.432 --> 18:21.267
Now you're going to teach me
how to investigate?

18:22.352 --> 18:25.730
No. I just want us to
be cautious.

18:25.772 --> 18:28.233
This could screw me over
and the company, too.

18:29.859 --> 18:32.111
Well, alright, if it's
that delicate...

18:33.655 --> 18:36.449
I know a person
who can help us figure this out.

18:37.200 --> 18:37.742
Who?

18:38.785 --> 18:41.287
Don't make me tell
you who it is.

18:43.748 --> 18:46.084
Uncle Antonio? No.

18:47.001 --> 18:48.503
Ignacio.

18:48.545 --> 18:50.547
That guy has saved
a lot of people's asses.

18:50.588 --> 18:53.174
No, if I ask him for help,
he's gonna grab me by the balls.

18:53.216 --> 18:54.592
I'll never be free
from that family.

18:55.718 --> 18:57.637
He's had you by the balls
for a while.

18:59.848 --> 19:03.268
Are you forgetting
that we're sitting here today,

19:03.309 --> 19:05.270
because he saved your ass
15 years ago?

19:05.979 --> 19:07.355
When you were born,

19:07.397 --> 19:11.359
you were given a surname
and that surname is a passport

19:11.401 --> 19:14.487
to get out of any shit
you get involved in.

19:14.529 --> 19:16.739
A passport no one else has,
not even me.

19:17.490 --> 19:19.075
Just so you know, buddy,

19:20.285 --> 19:22.328
I don't believe in that
magic rose shit.

19:23.204 --> 19:24.414
But I believe in your uncle.

19:25.290 --> 19:26.624
So pray to his sanctity.

19:28.001 --> 19:30.545
Because judging from the fear
on your poor face,

19:31.880 --> 19:34.173
I wouldn't like
to have to visit you in jail.

19:35.341 --> 19:36.426
Understand?

19:56.029 --> 19:57.113
Hi, Valeria.

19:58.823 --> 19:59.866
Hi.

19:59.908 --> 20:00.950
Can I come in?

20:01.618 --> 20:03.286
Sure. Yes.

20:09.250 --> 20:10.293
Did I miss something?

20:14.130 --> 20:15.924
I'm dating a girl
who has a baby.

20:18.843 --> 20:19.719
Is there anyone else here?

20:21.262 --> 20:23.848
Only the baby and she's
sleeping. So don't make noise.

20:23.890 --> 20:25.183
Why would I?

20:25.224 --> 20:27.560
I'm not attacking you.
I'm just saying.

20:28.561 --> 20:29.395
Everything okay?

20:30.980 --> 20:32.440
What did you get into now?

20:33.650 --> 20:34.984
This wasn't a good idea.

20:35.026 --> 20:37.070
Come here, Lola.

20:37.111 --> 20:40.531
Hold on, hold on.

20:41.532 --> 20:42.784
Calm down.

20:44.661 --> 20:45.787
Everything's okay.

20:51.125 --> 20:52.251
Let's talk.

21:03.096 --> 21:05.556
Isn't it a little weird
to frame that article?

21:05.598 --> 21:07.141
NOMINEES FOR NATIONAL
JOURNALISM AWARDS

21:07.183 --> 21:10.103
My girlfriend did that as a surprise.
What could I say?

21:14.524 --> 21:15.942
What's going on, Lola?

21:17.777 --> 21:18.403
I had to leave my house.

21:19.821 --> 21:23.116
- What do you mean?
- I'm investigating some people,

21:23.157 --> 21:25.326
and one belongs
to one of the most powerful

21:25.368 --> 21:27.370
- families in the country.
- Investigating what?

21:28.621 --> 21:29.706
They're involved in a crime.

21:30.832 --> 21:33.126
Are you sure they
committed the crime?

21:35.253 --> 21:37.964
I have dates that place them
where it happened.

21:38.006 --> 21:39.590
So it's just an assumption.

21:39.632 --> 21:40.466
No.

21:42.135 --> 21:43.594
They've been lying to me.

21:43.636 --> 21:45.138
Lola, still obsessed with lies?

21:45.179 --> 21:46.931
Please don't start, Valeria.

21:46.973 --> 21:51.019
I know you. I've seen you follow
hunches that lead nowhere many times.

21:51.060 --> 21:52.979
It's not a hunch.
These are facts.

21:53.021 --> 21:53.813
Facts.

21:55.481 --> 21:58.401
If you're certain, publish the article
and problem solved.

22:04.741 --> 22:06.492
You're not completely sure.

22:06.534 --> 22:08.536
These people know I'm
investigating them.

22:08.578 --> 22:09.746
How serious is the crime?

22:10.663 --> 22:11.289
I can't tell you.

22:12.874 --> 22:16.961
But if they did what I suspect,
I could be in danger, too.

22:17.003 --> 22:18.046
Are they following you?

22:20.089 --> 22:21.299
No, but they know where I live.

22:27.055 --> 22:28.389
Lola, you can't stay here.

22:28.431 --> 22:30.224
Who said I came to ask you that?

22:30.266 --> 22:32.060
- What did you come here for?
- To talk.

22:32.101 --> 22:34.103
Well, speak softly.
The baby's sleeping.

22:34.145 --> 22:37.774
What's up with you? My life is in danger and
you tell me to lower my voice?

22:37.815 --> 22:39.275
What do you want me to say?

22:39.317 --> 22:40.651
Abandon the investigation?

22:40.693 --> 22:41.778
That I'm worried about you?

22:42.945 --> 22:44.447
I didn't come to talk to
my ex-girlfriend.

22:46.074 --> 22:48.951
I came to talk to a journalist
who can push me to solve this.

22:48.993 --> 22:52.080
Sorry, we are the same person,
I won't push you to get killed.

22:52.121 --> 22:52.705
You pushed for your article.

22:54.040 --> 22:55.291
You wanted to get to the bottom
of everything.

22:56.459 --> 22:58.628
It's pathetic what one
does for a prize.

23:14.060 --> 23:14.894
Hi.

23:16.354 --> 23:17.438
We have to talk.

23:28.407 --> 23:29.242
Look...

23:32.745 --> 23:34.038
I'm sorry.

23:37.250 --> 23:41.671
I know I was supposed to travel so
we could spend my birthday together.

23:43.214 --> 23:45.591
But we had a huge problem
in the greenhouse.

23:49.137 --> 23:50.805
Really, Lucas.

23:52.265 --> 23:53.891
I know I should've told you.

23:55.393 --> 23:58.729
You can't imagine how crazy it was.
A disaster.

24:00.356 --> 24:01.983
They stole a mother plant.

24:03.276 --> 24:05.653
We realized
our crops were being sabotaged.

24:05.695 --> 24:07.196
It ended up being Susana...

24:07.864 --> 24:08.990
who's responsible.

24:10.074 --> 24:11.325
It's chaos.

24:18.457 --> 24:21.878
Plus, we have the thing with Ilana
Frank. You know we should...

24:23.296 --> 24:26.674
be delivering that by now
and we're behind schedule.

24:26.716 --> 24:29.802
Honestly, I can't even concentrate,
my head's about to explode.

24:38.769 --> 24:40.605
It's been a couple of
shitty days.

24:43.816 --> 24:46.319
And, unfortunately,
this situation...

24:51.199 --> 24:52.658
Aren't you gonna say anything?

24:54.202 --> 24:57.121
You said we had to talk,
and I feel like I'm here...

24:57.163 --> 24:58.873
talking, on my own.

25:05.296 --> 25:06.797
I don't know what else to say.

25:09.175 --> 25:11.135
Why do you keep secrets from me?

25:13.679 --> 25:15.264
Secrets? What secrets?

25:19.644 --> 25:21.062
About your dad's company.

25:24.440 --> 25:26.192
How did you find out?

25:30.529 --> 25:31.656
Doesn't matter.

25:35.534 --> 25:37.245
Do you know what my dad wants?

25:37.286 --> 25:40.122
I don't. I know the company
can go bankrupt.

25:41.249 --> 25:42.416
I don't know what your
intention is.

25:43.960 --> 25:46.879
I don't know why that company
matters to you right now.

25:46.921 --> 25:49.173
I don't care about that company.

25:49.966 --> 25:51.175
I care about you.

25:51.217 --> 25:54.595
Me? I'm okay, I'm
building my own path.

25:56.806 --> 25:58.266
Which path is that?

25:59.267 --> 26:01.394
Burning everything around you?

26:02.478 --> 26:04.480
Is that where your
fulfillment lies?

26:05.773 --> 26:08.651
Standing on the ashes
of your dad's empire?

26:10.486 --> 26:14.115
That empire is burning down on its
own, I'm only a spectator.

26:16.242 --> 26:20.079
You're the only spectator
who can save it.

26:22.790 --> 26:24.083
Mariana, you already won.

26:27.128 --> 26:28.212
What are you waiting for?

26:30.214 --> 26:32.675
For your dad to beg
you for help?

26:33.884 --> 26:35.803
Is that what you wanna become?

26:38.222 --> 26:40.182
I honestly don't get you, Lucas.

26:42.143 --> 26:43.394
You don't get me?

26:44.854 --> 26:47.857
I've treated you like shit
the last couple of days.

26:49.233 --> 26:51.986
Screwing it up over and over,
I feel like shit

26:52.028 --> 26:53.362
for the way I've been
treating you.

26:54.780 --> 26:58.576
And you're here talking to me
about my dad's land?

26:59.452 --> 27:00.953
What's the matter with you?

27:02.872 --> 27:04.123
What did you want?

27:06.751 --> 27:09.879
For me to make a scene
over your shitty treatment?

27:09.920 --> 27:12.006
Or break things...

27:12.882 --> 27:14.717
because my wife stood me up?

27:16.802 --> 27:17.970
Perhaps.

27:20.348 --> 27:21.932
I'm not that type of person.

27:25.144 --> 27:26.604
Maybe you should be.

27:50.503 --> 27:51.504
Felix.

27:52.171 --> 27:54.840
The extraction tests are done
and we have a problem.

27:56.467 --> 27:57.093
Now what?

27:58.427 --> 28:00.721
One of the plant lots
was already contaminated.

28:04.433 --> 28:06.852
- We isolated them already.
- How big is the lot?

28:06.894 --> 28:10.815
About ten plants that if we don't
destroy, will damage the rest.

28:10.856 --> 28:12.733
Nothing to do, Gabriel?

28:12.775 --> 28:15.236
It's not worth risking
everything for a few plants.

28:15.277 --> 28:18.155
We have to sacrifice that
if we want to save the crop.

28:18.197 --> 28:20.574
Are you sure those plants
are contaminated?

28:22.910 --> 28:25.913
Yes. What should we do?
We have to decide now.

29:19.175 --> 29:20.551
- Let's call an ambulance.
- What? No!

29:20.593 --> 29:22.678
Let's call the police then.

29:22.720 --> 29:26.182
Doll face, listen. If they connect us to
this shit they will use my family name

29:26.223 --> 29:28.642
- and talk about it in the papers--
- We didn't do anything, Nacho!

29:29.894 --> 29:31.896
Anything that comes out
about a SantamarÃ­a

29:31.937 --> 29:33.647
is a fucking bomb, man.
Imagine this.

29:37.776 --> 29:39.778
What's up?
Should we go ahead?

29:40.696 --> 29:41.489
Where's Antonio?

29:42.406 --> 29:44.575
Don't worry, he's a little late.

29:44.617 --> 29:46.160
But I need to speak with him.

29:46.869 --> 29:48.204
Have a whiskey, relax.

29:48.245 --> 29:50.748
No, I said I have to talk to him.
It's private.

29:50.789 --> 29:52.166
Ignacio, my uncle's not coming.

29:52.458 --> 29:54.460
Why?

29:54.502 --> 29:58.631
Well, the family's position is clear.
We'll give you whatever you need.

29:58.672 --> 30:00.508
Then why didn't he come
tell me that?

30:00.549 --> 30:03.052
Because I'll take care of this
from now on.

30:03.594 --> 30:05.304
Listen...

30:05.346 --> 30:09.558
If you're in trouble, we'll get
you out of it clean, believe me.

30:09.600 --> 30:11.894
I need you to trust me,
trust the family.

30:13.145 --> 30:14.813
Do you need help or not?

30:23.822 --> 30:24.698
What's the matter?

30:26.492 --> 30:27.368
The thing is...

30:29.411 --> 30:30.246
What?

30:32.206 --> 30:33.791
I don't know where to start.

30:36.418 --> 30:37.878
The beginning is a good start.

30:47.513 --> 30:50.140
We needed the best seed to
start KannaLab.

30:51.058 --> 30:52.309
Some months ago...

30:53.352 --> 30:54.520
Some months ago, what?

30:55.729 --> 30:57.231
Some months ago I
traveled to Tayrona.

30:59.316 --> 31:00.317
I wanted to...

31:00.985 --> 31:04.363
Ignacio, don't worry.
What happened in Tayrona?

31:06.740 --> 31:07.575
What happened?

31:09.535 --> 31:10.369
Nothing.

31:11.579 --> 31:13.872
Ignacio, tell me.
What happened in Tayrona?

31:15.082 --> 31:15.874
Nothing happened.

31:16.959 --> 31:18.669
Stop torturing yourself.
Let us help.

31:18.711 --> 31:20.754
I told you, nothing happened.
Forget it.

31:20.796 --> 31:22.214
- No.
- Forget what I just said.

32:00.878 --> 32:02.379
I need to ask you something.

32:02.421 --> 32:03.297
What's up?

32:05.215 --> 32:07.509
Can you promise KannaLab
will continue and nothing

32:07.551 --> 32:09.219
- will happen to Mariana?
- Relax, dude.

32:10.929 --> 32:12.181
I'm surrendering to the police.

32:13.432 --> 32:15.392
What the fuck are you saying?

32:15.434 --> 32:20.105
That night, Mariana was kissing that...
Israeli son of a bitch, remember?

32:20.147 --> 32:23.233
Doll face, whatever drug you're on,
it's making you lose it.

32:23.275 --> 32:25.694
It's not drugs, Nacho,
it's these fucking visions.

32:25.736 --> 32:27.946
Visions?
Now you're Walter Mercado?

32:34.036 --> 32:36.789
- I killed Assaf.
- What did you say?

32:36.830 --> 32:38.582
You heard me: I killed Assaf.

32:38.624 --> 32:40.125
I can't keep carrying this shit.

32:40.167 --> 32:42.419
I got Mariana involved.
They're gonna find out.

32:42.461 --> 32:44.588
They're gonna find out?
They're gonna?

32:44.630 --> 32:46.548
They already have, you
son of a bitch!

32:46.590 --> 32:47.925
Lola knows about Assaf!

32:47.966 --> 32:50.094
We're moments away
from being national news,

32:50.135 --> 32:52.971
and running from the cops
in our fucking underwear!

32:53.013 --> 32:54.390
Helicopters and everything!

32:54.431 --> 32:56.517
- I won't let that happen, I told you.
- Are you sure?

32:56.558 --> 32:58.894
I pointed my gun to his
head that night.

32:58.936 --> 33:01.897
And I had blood on my hands.
You know why they were bloody?

33:01.939 --> 33:04.358
- No fucking idea.
- I was pointing your gun at him,

33:04.400 --> 33:05.901
the one in your briefcase,
remember?

33:07.486 --> 33:09.530
- Do you remember anything, Nacho?
- Nothing.

33:12.866 --> 33:14.535
Mariana doesn't have to
pay for this.

33:14.576 --> 33:16.161
But if you talk,

33:16.203 --> 33:17.454
they're gonna screw
the three of us over.

33:19.373 --> 33:22.334
Nobody knows you two were at that
house that night. Nobody has to know.

33:23.794 --> 33:26.588
I'll say I did everything,
that you guys had no idea.

33:28.048 --> 33:28.632
KannaLab must go on.

33:30.759 --> 33:33.512
Promise you'll carry the company forward,
that Mariana will have the life she wants.

33:35.055 --> 33:37.433
You've been my friend all my life,
Nacho. Promise me.

33:40.394 --> 33:43.188
If you're gonna talk to the police,
you've gotta know what you'll say.

33:44.064 --> 33:46.024
So we don't get screwed.

33:49.403 --> 33:50.821
That's why I'm here, dude.

34:04.793 --> 34:08.130
What are you gonna
tell the police?

34:12.843 --> 34:13.802
Felix.

34:15.179 --> 34:16.305
What are you gonna tell them?

34:19.266 --> 34:20.726
That we were at a party.

34:22.644 --> 34:26.148
And then I left...
with Assaf to go to his place.

34:30.235 --> 34:35.240
Because I wanted to keep partying...
and you guys didn't feel like it.

34:38.619 --> 34:39.661
Why did you kill him?

34:50.798 --> 34:51.799
Felix!

34:53.717 --> 34:55.093
I don't know what to say.

35:04.895 --> 35:05.938
Tell the truth.

35:10.609 --> 35:11.568
Jealousy?

35:17.950 --> 35:18.992
Ah!

35:20.911 --> 35:21.870
Okay.

35:25.874 --> 35:26.708
Nacho.

35:27.626 --> 35:28.836
I need you to do me a favor.

35:31.755 --> 35:34.132
Give this to Mariana,
tell her happy birthday for me.

35:35.843 --> 35:37.427
Tell her everything
will be fine.

35:42.432 --> 35:43.475
Felix.

35:45.435 --> 35:46.812
Do you really wanna do this?

35:56.697 --> 35:58.323
Thank you so much, bro.

36:23.098 --> 36:24.099
Felix, put that down.

36:26.602 --> 36:27.728
Calm down.

36:39.656 --> 36:41.408
- Don't do it.
- What are you doing, man?

36:49.291 --> 36:50.375
It's not loaded.

37:22.658 --> 37:23.700
Gimme that shit.

37:27.245 --> 37:28.080
Gimme that shit.

37:29.247 --> 37:31.083
You jerk, gimme that shit!

37:39.132 --> 37:41.802
This way, please.
You're filing a report?

37:43.470 --> 37:45.055
Go ahead. I'll be
right with you.

37:47.599 --> 37:50.560
Gimme that shit!

38:33.270 --> 38:34.438
Clean yourself up.
