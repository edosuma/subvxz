WEBVTT

00:01.044 --> 00:05.840
So, Michael, you're saying there's
a new angle I should consider in this case?

00:05.882 --> 00:08.259
Love that. Major drama.

00:08.301 --> 00:10.595
Spill the tea, sweetheart.

00:10.678 --> 00:14.807
The premise of our system is that a person's
score during her time on Earth

00:15.225 --> 00:17.477
is final and inarguable.

00:17.644 --> 00:20.647
But because of my accidental experiment

00:20.730 --> 00:24.734
these four humans got better
after they died -

00:25.276 --> 00:26.861
that's not supposed to be possible.

00:27.195 --> 00:30.949
Over and over again, I watched as they became
thoughtful and generous and...

00:30.990 --> 00:33.451
and caring, and... and think about
where they started.

00:33.618 --> 00:34.744
Uh, Jason?

00:34.786 --> 00:38.790
Growing up in Jacksonville, what did you do
for fun after school, every day?

00:38.831 --> 00:42.001
Me and my friends whipped empty
spray paint cans at flamingos.

00:42.544 --> 00:44.420
And now he's so much better.

00:44.546 --> 00:45.797
I was already pretty good.

00:45.838 --> 00:48.174
When I was six, I hit one right on the butt.

00:48.341 --> 00:50.218
OK, let the immortal beings talk, darling.

00:50.260 --> 00:52.136
So, they got better in your little
pretend world.

00:52.178 --> 00:55.098
That doesn't prove anything
about what they were like on Earth.

00:55.139 --> 00:57.642
No, see, I think it does prove something.

00:58.309 --> 01:02.438
If I'm right, the system
by which we judge humans

01:02.480 --> 01:06.651
the very method we use to deem them
good or bad

01:07.235 --> 01:12.907
is so fundamentally flawed and unreasonable
that hundreds of millions of people

01:12.949 --> 01:16.953
have been wrongly condemned
to an eternity of torture.

01:18.913 --> 01:21.040
Damn! That was intense!

01:21.416 --> 01:24.085
Look at my arm, y'all!
Look, I got goosebumps.

01:24.961 --> 01:25.962
Huh, yeah.

01:26.004 --> 01:27.463
Doesn't happen very often.

01:34.262 --> 01:36.764
Wow. So, you saw your parents in the test?

01:37.181 --> 01:38.057
Yes.

01:38.266 --> 01:41.019
And I immediately fell right back
into my old pattern.

01:41.185 --> 01:44.772
Desperately trying to impress them
and earn their admiration.

01:45.106 --> 01:47.525
But then I heard this little voice
in my head saying

01:47.900 --> 01:50.236
"Tahani. Don't do this."

01:50.278 --> 01:53.323
The little voice in your head sounds like the
old lady from Downton Abbey?

01:53.364 --> 01:54.657
Oh, yes, sorry.

01:54.824 --> 01:56.326
Maggie Smith is my Godmother.

01:56.951 --> 01:59.245
Anyway, I took a deep breath.

01:59.287 --> 02:02.498
Told them I ate a Cheeto and walked away.

02:02.790 --> 02:03.791
Man!

02:04.208 --> 02:06.294
You have made so much progress.

02:07.086 --> 02:08.421
I'm proud of you, hot stuff.

02:09.505 --> 02:11.966
Whatever progress I have made

02:12.717 --> 02:14.761
it's because you and I have become mates.

02:15.887 --> 02:17.847
That's British for "friends."
- No, I know.

02:22.685 --> 02:25.104
Ooh, how are your shoulders so comfy?

02:25.146 --> 02:28.650
Well, I was voted "best shoulders"
by British Vogue four years in a row.

02:29.025 --> 02:30.818
I get it. You're perfect.

02:30.902 --> 02:32.570
Eleanor... I'm kidding.

02:33.029 --> 02:35.114
I was just taking the piss out of myself.

02:36.074 --> 02:37.617
It was only two years.

02:37.992 --> 02:40.286
Just doubled it... for humour.

02:41.537 --> 02:42.413
OK.

02:43.289 --> 02:46.292
Man, think about everything
that's happened to us.

02:46.334 --> 02:49.754
We died, Michael tortured us,
we teamed up with him...

02:49.962 --> 02:51.714
we escaped, we went through the portal

02:51.756 --> 02:54.050
the Judge ruled against us,
then Michael showed up.

02:54.467 --> 02:58.054
This has been one of the craziest years
of my life.

02:58.221 --> 02:59.097
"One of"?

02:59.722 --> 03:04.727
Yeah. I'm not sure what I would do
if one more insane thing happened.

03:04.769 --> 03:05.812
Hi, Jason.

03:05.853 --> 03:06.729
I love you.

03:07.188 --> 03:08.648
Oh, word?

03:08.940 --> 03:09.816
Word.

03:10.108 --> 03:11.526
I've been avoiding telling you.

03:11.567 --> 03:15.321
My excuse was that I needed time
to evaluate my complex feelings

03:15.363 --> 03:17.115
but that was just a rationalisation.

03:17.740 --> 03:20.618
Hey, I guess I learned how to
rationalise too.

03:20.660 --> 03:21.536
That's neat.

03:22.453 --> 03:26.207
This might be the last time I ever
get to talk to you, so there it is.

03:26.249 --> 03:27.125
I love you.

03:27.166 --> 03:29.669
And I hereby stop avoiding this topic

03:29.836 --> 03:32.964
and rationalizing it by saying the situation
is complicated.

03:33.381 --> 03:37.969
Or that my brain is grinding like a fork
in a garbage disposal.

03:38.177 --> 03:39.053
Alright.

03:39.303 --> 03:41.848
Whatever.
You're not really a part of this, Chidi.

03:42.724 --> 03:43.599
Hey.

03:43.766 --> 03:44.767
Guess what?

03:45.017 --> 03:47.061
I think I love you too, girl.

03:47.228 --> 03:48.187
I'm not a girl.

03:48.229 --> 03:51.482
I'm also not just a "Janet" anymore.
I don't know what I am.

03:55.027 --> 03:56.404
Hey, man. What's up?

04:06.330 --> 04:07.874
Hot diggity dog!

04:08.833 --> 04:09.959
Oh, no!

04:10.334 --> 04:13.629
Now the thing I said right after we kissed
will always be, "Hot diggity dog!"

04:13.671 --> 04:14.881
Whatever.

04:14.922 --> 04:16.674
It was an honest reaction. I stand by it.

04:16.924 --> 04:19.177
Hi, guys, couple quick announcements.

04:19.260 --> 04:21.345
Would anyone eat chips and guac
if I put it out?

04:21.387 --> 04:23.097
It's good. It's homemade.

04:23.264 --> 04:24.140
No takers?

04:24.182 --> 04:27.560
Alright - second thing, we figured out a plan
to save your souls.

04:27.810 --> 04:32.523
For the time being, the Judge
is gonna put you in your own Medium Places

04:32.565 --> 04:33.649
like Mindy St Claire.

04:33.733 --> 04:37.195
And while you're there,
I'll keep working every angle I can think of

04:37.236 --> 04:39.530
to get you guys into the Good Place for real.

04:39.655 --> 04:41.324
This is great. So, we'd all be together?

04:41.783 --> 04:43.826
Oh, no, that's the thing about Medium Places.

04:43.868 --> 04:46.829
It has to be tailored to what's medium
for the individuals

04:46.871 --> 04:49.499
so if you're all together, it ain't medium.

04:50.082 --> 04:51.709
How much time will we be alone?

04:51.959 --> 04:54.670
Hard to say. Uh, could be a month.

04:54.712 --> 04:56.464
Could be... a million years.

04:56.506 --> 04:58.925
So, between a month and a million years.
Some...

04:58.966 --> 04:59.884
Yeah.
- Give or take.

04:59.926 --> 05:01.761
Somewhere in there.
Come on, you guys.

05:01.803 --> 05:06.390
I know this isn't perfect but I need more
time to build my case, and it's either this

05:06.557 --> 05:08.643
or back to the Bad Place.
- Yeah.

05:09.769 --> 05:10.645
I'll say it.

05:11.479 --> 05:12.688
Both those options suck.

05:12.855 --> 05:15.233
OK, I'm sorry if that's blunt, Your Honour,
but it's true.

05:15.483 --> 05:18.069
Also, Chidi just laid one on me,
so I'm kinda dizzy.

05:18.152 --> 05:19.362
You two kissed?

05:20.071 --> 05:21.364
Hot diggity dog!

05:21.531 --> 05:22.490
That's what I said!

05:22.865 --> 05:25.284
The point is, we've all gotten better.

05:25.326 --> 05:27.995
Why should we have to go live alone
in a boring void

05:28.037 --> 05:31.123
because of a messed-up system?
How is that justice?

05:31.165 --> 05:34.752
OK, slow your roll there, Erin Brockovich.

05:34.794 --> 05:40.091
First of all, y'all didn't get good enough
to pass the tests I just gave you.

05:40.424 --> 05:43.719
Second, I still believe that the only reason
that you improved

05:43.761 --> 05:45.346
in Michael's fake Neighbourhood

05:45.388 --> 05:49.767
is because you thought there was a reward
at the end of the rainbow.

05:49.976 --> 05:52.895
You're supposed to do good things
because you're good

05:53.229 --> 05:55.898
not because you're seeking moral dessert.

05:56.023 --> 05:59.402
And I still believe that they would've
become good people

05:59.443 --> 06:01.153
if they'd just gotten a...

06:04.615 --> 06:07.952
a push in the right direction.

06:09.745 --> 06:10.872
Oh, no!

06:10.913 --> 06:13.040
Nope. Nope. Absolutely not.

06:13.082 --> 06:16.460
It's a little crazy.
- A little bit crazy? It's Looney Tunes.

06:16.502 --> 06:18.129
What are they talking about?
- No idea.

06:18.170 --> 06:21.299
It sets a very dangerous precedent.
- It's only four people.

06:21.340 --> 06:23.301
And it's clearly the best way

06:23.342 --> 06:26.637
to see if bad people can become good
without knowing anything about

06:26.679 --> 06:28.222
what's waiting for them in the afterlife.

06:28.264 --> 06:29.181
Shotgun!

06:29.223 --> 06:31.726
Whatever they're talking about,
if there's a shotgun, I call shotgun.

06:31.767 --> 06:33.060
It's never gonna work, man.

06:33.102 --> 06:35.104
If it doesn't, then they go right back
to the Bad Place.

06:35.146 --> 06:36.397
No one gets hurt

06:36.689 --> 06:37.982
except them. Forever.

06:38.024 --> 06:41.110
And me, I assume, also... forever.

06:43.070 --> 06:44.071
Mmmm...

06:44.113 --> 06:45.072
ughhhhh...

06:45.114 --> 06:47.033
eeeuuuoww...

06:47.074 --> 06:48.200
OK, let's do it.

06:48.242 --> 06:49.118
Yes!

06:49.744 --> 06:51.746
I don't know why,
I'm just feeling kinda funky.

06:51.787 --> 06:55.541
But there have to be strict rules,
otherwise the results will be tainted

06:55.583 --> 06:59.921
and I reserve the right to change my mind
at any point.

06:59.962 --> 07:02.173
About what? Would someone who's not
an eternal being

07:02.214 --> 07:04.300
please explain to me what the f...

07:06.886 --> 07:08.220
Why are you like this?

07:08.512 --> 07:10.765
Excuse me? "Why am I like this?"

07:11.098 --> 07:12.391
You don't know me, dude.

07:12.433 --> 07:13.768
You don't know what I'm like.

07:14.352 --> 07:16.062
Look what you made me do, jagoff.

07:16.312 --> 07:17.313
Ugh...

07:17.688 --> 07:19.190
- Look out!
- Uh-oh.

07:33.788 --> 07:34.664
Holy crap.

07:35.873 --> 07:36.958
I just almost died.

07:39.043 --> 07:40.461
<i>She needs to know what was said.</i>

07:40.503 --> 07:43.881
<i>That was so unfair.
- First of all, this was just yesterday.</i>

07:43.923 --> 07:46.258
God, Eleanor. Take longer next time.

07:46.300 --> 07:47.802
Oh, you look like crap.

07:48.886 --> 07:53.182
I was outside the supermarket arguing
with that little environmental twerp.

07:53.224 --> 07:54.850
Ugh, I hate that guy.

07:54.892 --> 07:57.770
Really? That skinny little hippie body
kinda turns me on.

07:57.812 --> 07:58.729
Gross.

07:58.771 --> 08:03.359
Guys, listen! I dropped the margarita mix
and when I went to pick it up

08:04.110 --> 08:07.321
a bunch of shopping carts came right at me,
and I was just frozen.

08:07.571 --> 08:09.991
And then someone pushed me out of the way

08:10.032 --> 08:14.120
and the carts got, like, demolished
by a truck.

08:15.204 --> 08:16.580
I mean, I could've died.

08:16.706 --> 08:18.040
Oh, my God.
- Whoa.

08:18.416 --> 08:19.583
That's crazy.

08:21.168 --> 08:23.045
So, is the margarita mix, like, gone?

08:23.337 --> 08:26.757
I had a near-death experience recently.
You know that old warehouse that burned down

08:26.799 --> 08:28.509
last month and like, four people died?

08:28.801 --> 08:31.971
That building is, like, right by
my old dentist.

08:32.221 --> 08:35.307
If I still went to that dentist,
and I had an appointment that day

08:35.766 --> 08:38.644
I would've been, like... right near there.

08:38.686 --> 08:41.605
I was in Syracuse, New York

08:41.981 --> 08:45.026
like, two weeks before 9/11.

08:45.234 --> 08:46.527
No way!
- Yeah.

08:46.569 --> 08:47.611
Fourteen days.

08:47.653 --> 08:49.864
I can't believe we all almost died.
- I know!

08:49.905 --> 08:52.116
I'm like...

08:56.912 --> 08:58.664
My name is Eleanor Shellstrop.

08:58.706 --> 09:00.916
And I think I might be a monster.

09:01.417 --> 09:03.335
I'm rude. I'm selfish.

09:03.419 --> 09:06.255
I cyber-bullied Ryan Lochte
until he quit Instagram.

09:06.922 --> 09:08.507
But something happened to me today

09:08.549 --> 09:14.305
and from now on I'm gonna try to become
a better, kinder, more generous person.

09:17.308 --> 09:18.642
Hey! Can I use your credit card?

09:19.477 --> 09:21.228
You know what? Yes, you can.

09:21.270 --> 09:22.354
Cool. It's for porn.

09:22.396 --> 09:23.272
I already used it.

09:34.075 --> 09:34.950
Hey.

09:35.242 --> 09:36.202
You look happy.

09:36.285 --> 09:37.328
Did you get laid last night?

09:37.495 --> 09:38.370
I didn't.

09:38.496 --> 09:39.789
Tried. Hard.

09:40.206 --> 09:42.541
With this chick that I met
after I followed her into a yoga class

09:42.583 --> 09:44.001
but she wasn't into it.

09:44.210 --> 09:45.836
Maced me - right in the eyes.

09:46.253 --> 09:47.338
Stung like hell.

09:47.880 --> 09:48.839
What was I saying?

09:49.340 --> 09:50.466
Oh, yeah. Hey.

09:50.633 --> 09:51.634
Listen, dude.

09:51.675 --> 09:52.843
What you're doing here

09:53.052 --> 09:55.387
selling fake medicine to people,
tricking them...

09:56.180 --> 09:57.056
is wrong.

09:58.182 --> 09:59.433
Yeah. And?

09:59.475 --> 10:02.478
I can't be a part of it anymore.
I'm trying to become a better person...

10:02.520 --> 10:03.813
and as long as I work here...

10:03.854 --> 10:05.523
Yeah, sure, fine, whatever, you quit.

10:05.564 --> 10:07.274
Who cares? Give me your company ID.

10:08.692 --> 10:09.568
Thank you.

10:09.610 --> 10:10.778
And your parking pass.

10:11.612 --> 10:12.988
And your panties, please.

10:13.030 --> 10:14.323
Dude!
- What? Come on.

10:14.365 --> 10:15.241
I had to try.

10:15.658 --> 10:17.743
By the way, technically
that is not sexual harassment

10:17.785 --> 10:20.621
because she doesn't work here anymore.
- You're wearing a wire?

10:20.663 --> 10:22.706
Yeah. Company's being investigated for fraud

10:22.748 --> 10:24.625
so I'm helping the feds bring everyone down.

10:24.834 --> 10:25.960
Good timing on your part.

10:26.252 --> 10:27.461
Thank you?
- No.

10:27.503 --> 10:28.587
Thank <i>you...</i>

10:28.796 --> 10:30.464
for wearing open-toed shoes today.

10:30.881 --> 10:32.424
Wow.
- Dude. Get help.

10:32.633 --> 10:35.052
I'm becoming a better person.
You should too.

10:35.553 --> 10:36.762
Hey, Eleanor!

10:36.804 --> 10:38.806
Do you want to come to Lauren's baby shower?

10:38.848 --> 10:40.182
Do you wanna chew on my ass...

10:40.224 --> 10:41.600
...sss...

10:41.642 --> 10:43.060
...sortment of brownies

10:43.102 --> 10:45.604
that I will be bringing to Lauren's
baby shower?

10:45.980 --> 10:46.856
Sure.

10:48.149 --> 10:49.817
Hi, there. Do you have a second
to talk about the environment?

10:50.359 --> 10:51.735
Hey. Remember me?

10:51.777 --> 10:52.736
Ah! Don't hurt me!

10:52.778 --> 10:54.363
My bones are brittle.
I have a calcium deficiency.

10:54.405 --> 10:55.948
No, I'm not gonna hurt you, man.

10:56.157 --> 10:57.741
I came to apologise.

10:59.118 --> 10:59.994
There, I did it.

11:00.035 --> 11:00.953
I apologised.

11:01.453 --> 11:03.372
No, you didn't.
- Yes, I did, assface!

11:03.622 --> 11:05.749
Mm... nope. You're right. I didn't.

11:06.500 --> 11:11.046
I apologise for being mean to you,
like a thousand times.

11:11.088 --> 11:13.549
There's really no excuse.

11:14.300 --> 11:15.301
Thanks.

11:16.177 --> 11:17.094
Apology accepted.

11:17.136 --> 11:18.137
OK.

11:18.971 --> 11:20.723
Uh, what's happening? I'm scared.

11:20.764 --> 11:23.559
Hey, I'm on kind of, like,
a self-improvement kick.

11:23.601 --> 11:27.688
Do you think you could help me out?
Teach me to get all horny for the environment

11:27.730 --> 11:28.606
or whatever?

11:29.648 --> 11:31.525
Hey, everyone. This is Eleanor.

11:31.650 --> 11:33.027
She's joining the team.

11:33.068 --> 11:34.778
Hi.

11:34.820 --> 11:36.906
Welcome.
- Nice to meet you. Hi.

11:41.785 --> 11:43.454

12:27.081 --> 12:29.083
Mm-hm.
- I'm actually trying to eat vegetarian.

12:29.124 --> 12:30.542
Ew! Why?

12:30.751 --> 12:32.962
Is it because you feel bad
for all the widdle animals

12:33.003 --> 12:34.255
with their cute widdle faces

12:34.296 --> 12:37.049
because people stuff them into tiny cages
just so that we can eat them?

12:37.299 --> 12:39.510
Yeah. That's exactly why, actually.

12:39.551 --> 12:42.179
Also, it's the easiest way to lower
your carbon foot print

12:42.221 --> 12:43.973
not eating meat.
- What?

12:44.306 --> 12:46.100
OK, guys, um...

12:46.225 --> 12:47.601
Can I say something for a second?

12:47.851 --> 12:49.770
I love you.
- Aw!

12:49.812 --> 12:52.523
I do. I mean, I went through a really
rough time last year

12:52.564 --> 12:55.359
with the whole "Dress Bitch" thing and people
selling t-shirts with my face on them

12:55.401 --> 12:57.486
but you two stuck by me.

12:58.237 --> 13:00.155
I love you, you dumb sluts!
- Aaaah!

13:00.197 --> 13:01.699
Come on!

13:01.740 --> 13:03.784
OK, there's probably something
we should tell you.

13:03.826 --> 13:07.204
Or not. We could also not.

13:07.246 --> 13:09.623
We have to. It's the right thing to do.

13:12.042 --> 13:14.420
I tore your dress. And then I lied about it.

13:14.753 --> 13:18.132
And then Brittany and I were the ones
who made and sold the t-shirts.

13:18.173 --> 13:20.134
But... we did not keep the money.

13:20.175 --> 13:22.094
Yes, we did. We kept all the money.

13:22.720 --> 13:24.179
And I'm really sorry.

13:25.389 --> 13:26.265
OK.

13:27.057 --> 13:30.853
That took a lot of courage for you
to admit that.

13:30.894 --> 13:34.231
Mm-hm.
- And I admire your honesty.

13:35.024 --> 13:36.817
You stupid skank!

13:37.109 --> 13:38.861
How could you do that to me?

13:38.902 --> 13:41.155
I hate you! You're both disgusting hogs

13:41.196 --> 13:43.949
and I want you to move out
of my apartment, forever!

13:43.991 --> 13:45.826
Literally starting right now!

13:48.662 --> 13:50.331
I'm still really glad we told the truth.

13:50.748 --> 13:52.416
Cooooool.

13:52.750 --> 13:53.625
Mm.

13:54.001 --> 13:58.047
OK, steamed vegetable medley and ice water.

13:58.088 --> 13:59.506
Can I just get the check?

14:00.215 --> 14:02.718
And can you throw these plants in the trash?

14:05.346 --> 14:07.556

14:07.765 --> 14:13.187

14:36.752 --> 14:37.628
Damn it!

14:44.718 --> 14:45.803
They're suing you?

14:45.844 --> 14:47.679
This chick is claiming she has whiplash.

14:47.721 --> 14:50.182
She wasn't in the car when I hit it.

14:50.224 --> 14:51.266
This is on you.

14:51.308 --> 14:53.894
You should've pretended like
you didn't see it and walked away.

14:53.936 --> 14:55.729
Like everyone else does.

14:55.771 --> 14:59.149
I know! I've hit your car like six times
and never said anything.

14:59.191 --> 15:01.110
But I'm trying to be good.

15:03.237 --> 15:05.447
How's that working out for you?

15:15.791 --> 15:16.875
It's open, dummy!

15:18.919 --> 15:20.421
Eleanor! Where have you been?

15:20.462 --> 15:21.880
Oh, hey, man.

15:21.922 --> 15:25.134
Sorry, it's been a crazy month, you know?

15:25.175 --> 15:27.428
Moving was a hassle,
and I'm in the middle of a lawsuit

15:27.469 --> 15:29.972
and I ate vegetables for the first time

15:30.013 --> 15:31.723
and I got diarrhoea for, like, a week.

15:31.765 --> 15:34.351
Uh... I know we don't pay a lot
but this is a job

15:34.393 --> 15:35.936
and we need to know we can count on you.

15:35.978 --> 15:38.564
We're meeting tonight to discuss long-term
strategy for the organisation.

15:38.605 --> 15:40.190
Dude, dude, dude, dude...
- I really think it would be--

15:40.232 --> 15:43.819
...dude, dude, dude. Oh, sorry to interrupt
whatever boring crap this is

15:43.861 --> 15:45.696
but, dude, you need to get dressed.

15:45.737 --> 15:48.282
I got tickets to Taylor Splift

15:48.615 --> 15:50.325
the Taylor Swift reggae cover band.

15:50.701 --> 15:52.786
They're terrible. It's gonna be amazing!

15:54.746 --> 15:56.290
Yeah, that sounds like more fun.

15:56.331 --> 15:57.666
I'm-a do that.
- Eleanor!

15:57.708 --> 15:59.877
What! What, dude?

15:59.918 --> 16:02.045
I've been nothing but good for, like,
six months

16:02.087 --> 16:04.840
and all I have to show for it
is this crummy apartment

16:04.882 --> 16:07.676
a lawsuit, a loose caboose,
and an overdrawn bank account.

16:07.718 --> 16:10.596
Being good is for suckers.
What do you even get out of it?

16:11.305 --> 16:14.224
A feeling of fulfillment... in your soul.

16:16.643 --> 16:19.563
Gross. That's the grossest sentence
I've ever heard.

16:19.771 --> 16:21.064
OK? I quit.

16:21.106 --> 16:22.941
Eat my farts, Benedict Cumberbatch.

16:24.735 --> 16:25.652
Whew!

16:26.111 --> 16:27.279
I still think he's kinda hot.

16:27.321 --> 16:30.240
I guess, in like a sick Victorian boy
kinda way.

16:30.282 --> 16:32.451
Ooh, yeah, yeah, yeah,
I want to, like, feed him soup.

16:33.243 --> 16:34.912
It is good to have you back.

16:34.953 --> 16:36.580
You are one of the most gifted con-women

16:36.622 --> 16:38.665
I have ever watched sleep through her window.

16:38.707 --> 16:42.669
Thanks, bud. So, tell me about
the new business.

16:42.711 --> 16:44.630
We sell classes at a for-profit university

16:44.671 --> 16:47.216
and the classes train people how to sell
supplements.

16:47.424 --> 16:49.843
So, it's a ponzi scheme
within a ponzi scheme.

16:49.885 --> 16:51.094
That sounds kinda dicey.

16:51.136 --> 16:52.221
Oh, it's super dicey.

16:52.262 --> 16:56.099
But I'm in witness protection so technically
I can't be convicted of any crime.

16:56.558 --> 16:58.602
Well, that's definitely not true,
but I also don't care.

16:58.644 --> 16:59.811
Which one's my desk?

17:03.440 --> 17:05.442
You realise what the problem is, right?
- Yes.

17:05.484 --> 17:06.652
But there's no way to help.

17:11.490 --> 17:12.950
I'm only giving that guy three stars

17:12.991 --> 17:14.826
cos he didn't let me stick my head out
the moonroof.

17:14.868 --> 17:15.744
Yeah!

17:15.786 --> 17:18.288
Dude, my boyfriend just texted.

17:18.330 --> 17:20.457
His wife's out of town,
so I'm gonna head over there.

17:20.499 --> 17:21.458
Mwah!

17:21.500 --> 17:24.086
What? That's lame. Boo!

17:24.127 --> 17:25.587
Happy birthday!

17:25.754 --> 17:27.130
Hello, bartender.

17:27.381 --> 17:29.132
One alcohol drink, please.

17:29.216 --> 17:31.260
It's my birthday, if you wanna
give it to me for free.

17:32.469 --> 17:34.930
I always say that,
but it actually is my birthday.

17:34.972 --> 17:38.392
Last year on my birthday, I almost died

17:39.226 --> 17:44.231
and then I did a bunch of stuff
that was good, but weird

17:45.023 --> 17:47.776
and then I stopped, and now I'm here.

17:49.069 --> 17:51.071
Sounds like you had a pretty crazy year.

17:51.113 --> 17:53.240
Hm.
- Wanna talk about it?

17:55.742 --> 17:58.954
And in the end, Anthony Anderson
and Jerry O'Connell

17:58.996 --> 18:00.789
started a successful shampoo company

18:00.831 --> 18:04.334
and you see the kangaroo
jumping around Australia.

18:06.378 --> 18:10.007
That is the plot to the movie
"Kangaroo Jack."

18:10.591 --> 18:11.550
Why'd I tell you that?

18:11.675 --> 18:12.551
It's unclear.

18:13.719 --> 18:15.053
You know, the thing is...

18:15.095 --> 18:17.723
the problem, really, with being a do-gooder?

18:18.181 --> 18:20.392
What's that?
- No one cares.

18:20.809 --> 18:22.728
I mean some people care a little bit.

18:22.769 --> 18:26.189
The twerpy little twerps
from the environmental place, they care

18:26.231 --> 18:29.109
but I was a good person for six months.

18:29.735 --> 18:31.570
That's, like, five years.

18:31.778 --> 18:35.741
And it felt OK but not as good
as I thought it would.

18:36.199 --> 18:37.784
And what did I get for it?

18:38.619 --> 18:41.747
Ah, see? Now you're talking about
moral dessert.

18:41.788 --> 18:42.664
Exactly.

18:44.291 --> 18:45.417
Wait. I am? What?

18:45.459 --> 18:51.131
"Moral dessert" is the concept that if you
act with virtue, you deserve a reward.

18:51.214 --> 18:53.675
Right. I did a bunch of good stuff.

18:53.717 --> 18:57.220
I didn't get jack. Not fair, universe!

18:57.262 --> 19:00.182
Alright, even if the universe
did function that way

19:00.223 --> 19:03.727
who's to say that you didn't dig yourself
such a deep hole

19:03.769 --> 19:05.604
over the first 34 years of your life

19:05.646 --> 19:10.942
that the six months you spent being good
weren't enough to get you out of that hole?

19:11.193 --> 19:14.196
See, there's a lot of great writing
about this, if you're interested.

19:15.405 --> 19:18.075
Who died and made you in charge
of frickin' every...

19:18.408 --> 19:19.618
knowing everything.

19:21.203 --> 19:26.833
Well, you know, I recently got sort of into
ethics and moral philosophy.

19:28.460 --> 19:30.379
You sound like a real live wire.

19:30.671 --> 19:31.546
Whatevs.

19:31.588 --> 19:34.966
The point is,
if I'm not gonna get rewarded somehow

19:35.008 --> 19:38.720
with, like, a tiara
or one of those diagonal award belts.

19:39.179 --> 19:40.222
Sash.
- Sure.

19:40.263 --> 19:42.557
Sash.
- Then why should I do good things?

19:43.433 --> 19:47.479
You know, I had a friend that said whenever
she was doing something bad

19:47.521 --> 19:50.524
she'd hear this... this little voice
in her head.

19:50.565 --> 19:54.236
Distant little voice saying,
"Oh, come on now, you know this is wrong."

19:54.861 --> 19:59.032
And then when she started doing good things,
that voice went away.

19:59.908 --> 20:00.867
It was a relief.

20:01.368 --> 20:06.415
Your friend sounds like
she's one pickle short of a pickle party.

20:08.250 --> 20:09.876
I might have alcohol poisoning.

20:10.919 --> 20:13.004
She was a little rough
around the edges, but...

20:13.380 --> 20:15.048
she was also a really good person.

20:15.757 --> 20:16.675
When she tried.

20:17.259 --> 20:20.095
See, I think that little voice
was her conscience

20:20.220 --> 20:22.723
trying to guide her in the right direction.

20:24.307 --> 20:26.518
I gotta go home. What do I owe ya?

20:26.643 --> 20:28.019
The real question, Eleanor

20:29.646 --> 20:31.106
is what do we owe to each other?

20:32.274 --> 20:33.150
What?

20:33.191 --> 20:36.111
Did I sell you a drink? Am I a bartender?

20:36.236 --> 20:37.946
Drinks are on me.

20:39.239 --> 20:40.115
Good luck.

20:45.996 --> 20:47.205
Ow...

20:52.669 --> 20:53.920
Anybody notice I was gone?

20:53.962 --> 20:54.838
Nope.

21:13.732 --> 21:16.359
What do we owe to each other?

21:16.401 --> 21:19.404
That is the question Tim Scanlon asked
decades ago

21:19.988 --> 21:24.117
and it is the question I will try to answer
over the next three hours.

21:24.284 --> 21:25.786
Ugh. No, thanks.

21:26.244 --> 21:27.913
We all have a voice in our head.

21:27.954 --> 21:31.124
That voice doesn't tell us what to do,
or not do

21:31.166 --> 21:36.505
but it does warn us when we do things
that don't feel good or right.

21:36.546 --> 21:38.632
The difference between...
- The term "reasonable."

21:38.673 --> 21:41.760
What does it mean to be a reasonable person?

21:41.802 --> 21:44.346
I may have a different definition
of reasonable...

21:44.387 --> 21:45.388
So, why do it then?

21:45.430 --> 21:47.182
Why choose to be good every day

21:47.224 --> 21:52.437
if there is no guaranteed reward
we can count on, now or in the afterlife?

21:52.854 --> 21:56.566
I argue that we choose to be good
because of our bonds with other people

21:56.608 --> 22:00.362
and our innate desire
to treat them with dignity.

22:00.612 --> 22:03.698
At the intersection of empathy and ethics

22:04.407 --> 22:08.286
is the realisation
that we are not in this alone.

22:08.829 --> 22:09.704
Thank you.

22:12.290 --> 22:13.416
Hey, dog bait.

22:13.458 --> 22:15.085
Didn't you get my message? Let's go!

22:15.126 --> 22:16.378
Time is booze.

22:16.419 --> 22:18.171
Yeah, no thanks. I'm...

22:19.422 --> 22:20.841
going somewhere else.

22:27.931 --> 22:28.932
Hi.
- G'day.

22:28.974 --> 22:31.059
Where you headed?
- Saint John's University, please.

22:31.101 --> 22:31.977
No worries.

22:36.940 --> 22:38.233
Do you wanna talk to God?

22:38.275 --> 22:40.402
What? No. Get away from me, freak.

23:00.088 --> 23:01.548
Hi.
- Oh, I'm sorry.

23:01.590 --> 23:02.632
Office hours are on Tuesday.

23:02.674 --> 23:04.092
Oh, I... I'm not a student.

23:04.134 --> 23:06.636
Are you Chidi Ana... Kendrick?

23:07.095 --> 23:09.014
Anagonye. And yes.

23:09.055 --> 23:12.142
From the long, nerdy video about
the little voice that tells you to be good?

23:12.183 --> 23:14.060
From the Kissac Foundation lecture series

23:14.102 --> 23:16.688
on the practical applications
of ethical theory - yes.

23:16.730 --> 23:17.772
Great. Hi.

23:17.814 --> 23:19.316
My name is Eleanor Shellstrop.

23:20.775 --> 23:21.693
Can we talk?

23:24.738 --> 23:25.614
OK.

23:26.615 --> 23:27.699
Here we go.
