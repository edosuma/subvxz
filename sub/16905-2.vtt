WEBVTT

00:06.480 --> 00:07.481
Liz,

00:07.776 --> 00:08.977
there's something
wrong with Pete.

00:14.600 --> 00:17.435
Oh, my God, is he dead?

00:17.469 --> 00:19.687
I... I don't know what happened.

00:24.860 --> 00:27.862
Kenneth, I need a light bulb
replaced in my dressing room.

00:27.896 --> 00:30.898
Easy as pie, Ms. Maroney.
What could go wrong?

00:30.932 --> 00:34.702
Why would I even say that?

00:42.578 --> 00:44.662
Hey, whatever
happened to TiVo?

00:44.713 --> 00:46.080
Remember, you used
to fast-forward,

00:46.114 --> 00:47.782
it'd make that sound?
Boop-boop, boop-boop.

00:47.816 --> 00:50.335
Yeah. Yeah, then it'd
be all like, bung-bung.

00:50.386 --> 00:52.670
- Boop-boop, boop-boop.
- Bung-bung, bung-bung.

00:52.721 --> 00:54.489
- Bung-bung, bung-bung.
- Boop-boop, boop-boop.

00:54.523 --> 00:57.859
Boop-boop, boop-boop.

00:57.893 --> 01:00.628
What's this?

01:05.934 --> 01:09.904
It's Terry, the gender-neutral
doll I had when I was a kid.

01:09.938 --> 01:14.475
And he/she has his/her
baseball glove and baby.

01:14.493 --> 01:16.744
And both sets of genitals!

01:16.779 --> 01:18.212
That was hard to track down.

01:18.247 --> 01:20.014
Today, almost all of them
are in police evidence lockers.

01:20.049 --> 01:21.916
So, happy three-month
anniversary,

01:21.950 --> 01:24.118
and happy two-week anniversary
of you going to the bathroom

01:24.153 --> 01:25.219
when I'm here.

01:25.254 --> 01:26.754
You shouldn't
be buying me gifts.

01:26.789 --> 01:28.155
You should be saving
for your business.

01:28.173 --> 01:29.891
Oh, I think
remembering our anniversary

01:29.925 --> 01:31.492
is going to get
me some business.

01:31.510 --> 01:33.494
Aww, yeah!

01:33.512 --> 01:37.932
There's a whole other hand
where that came from, big boy.

01:37.966 --> 01:39.550
Not my best.

01:39.601 --> 01:41.703
Hey, listen, why don't
you go in late today, okay?

01:41.737 --> 01:43.204
I'll make pancakes
with M&Ms in them.

01:43.238 --> 01:44.389
Fine, I'll stay!
Gyah.

01:44.440 --> 01:45.723
All right.

01:45.774 --> 01:46.874
Do you want a smiley face?

01:46.909 --> 01:49.911
German flag, please.

01:53.032 --> 01:55.516
Jordan's comments have
angered gay-rights groups

01:55.534 --> 01:57.385
and are likely
annoying his co-workers

01:57.419 --> 01:59.620
who thought they'd linger
over breakfast this morning,

01:59.655 --> 02:01.372
perhaps with a new lover.

02:01.407 --> 02:04.392
Wow, that is some detailed
reporting, curry.

02:22.745 --> 02:25.096
When I say "NBC,"
you say...

02:25.147 --> 02:26.097
Over it!

02:26.148 --> 02:28.015
- NBC!
- Over it!

02:28.050 --> 02:29.767
- NBC!
- Over it!

02:29.818 --> 02:31.602
Word.

02:31.653 --> 02:34.622
Ugh, look at that
old bag from <i>TGS.</i>

02:34.656 --> 02:36.824
Okay,
I am a human being, sir.

02:36.859 --> 02:39.160
Oh, you mean my tote bag.

02:39.194 --> 02:41.395
Yes, I need a new one.

02:41.413 --> 02:43.664
Look, I'm sorry about Tracy.

02:43.699 --> 02:47.251
He really is a good person.

02:47.286 --> 02:50.421
Do you think I'm
pulling this hat off?

02:50.456 --> 02:51.606
No.

02:51.640 --> 02:54.459
- From the top!
- Over it!

02:57.679 --> 02:58.629
Oh, my God, there you are.

02:58.680 --> 02:59.931
We're losing sponsors, Liz.

02:59.965 --> 03:01.149
Did you know that snuggles

03:01.183 --> 03:03.251
the fabric softener bear
is gay?

03:04.937 --> 03:06.521
He's dating the charmin cub.

03:06.555 --> 03:10.191
I thought they were babies.

03:10.225 --> 03:11.759
Unbelievable.

03:11.794 --> 03:14.395
Tracy, do you know how many of
your hard-working and dedicated

03:14.429 --> 03:18.282
co-workers are gay?

03:18.317 --> 03:21.602
Him. Him.

03:21.637 --> 03:25.006
Her when she's drunk.

03:25.040 --> 03:27.108
I genuinely don't know.

03:27.142 --> 03:29.377
That one's a puzzler.

03:31.613 --> 03:34.415
And why did you have
to offend the gay community?

03:34.450 --> 03:37.885
It is the most organized
of all the communities.

03:37.920 --> 03:40.304
They make the Japanese
look like the greeks.

03:40.339 --> 03:43.391
How is what I said offensive,
and that's not?

03:43.425 --> 03:45.893
Because no one
heard me say it.

03:45.928 --> 03:48.896
Look, I need to know what
we're apologizing for, Tray.

03:48.931 --> 03:51.265
What did you say?

03:51.300 --> 03:52.834
Being gay is stupid.

03:52.868 --> 03:55.703
If you want to see a penis,
take off your pants.

03:55.737 --> 03:57.405
If I got turned into a gay,

03:57.439 --> 04:00.208
I'd sit around all day
and look at my own junk.

04:00.242 --> 04:01.692
Oh, my God.

04:01.743 --> 04:04.912
First of all, if you
"got turned into a gay"?

04:04.947 --> 04:07.114
Do you think the people of
Raleigh, North Carolina

04:07.149 --> 04:08.983
turned Clay Aiken gay?

04:09.017 --> 04:11.335
Why not?
The Bronx turned me dyslexic.

04:11.370 --> 04:13.821
Look, you're a public figure,
and believe it or not,

04:13.856 --> 04:17.358
the dumb things you say
may influence or hurt people.

04:17.392 --> 04:18.559
You need to apologize.

04:18.594 --> 04:21.045
I already called Glad,
Liz Lemon.

04:21.096 --> 04:22.680
Thank you for calling Glad,

04:22.714 --> 04:24.765
stronger trash bags
with less plastic.

04:24.800 --> 04:26.634
This is Diane.
How may I help you?

04:26.668 --> 04:29.036
Hey Diane,
it's Tracy Jordan.

04:29.071 --> 04:30.471
Sorry about what I said.

04:30.506 --> 04:32.106
- Well, okeydokey.

04:32.140 --> 04:33.908
That's the wrong
"glad," Tracy.

04:33.942 --> 04:36.110
Whatever. I'm tired of
apologizing all the time

04:36.144 --> 04:37.728
for just being myself.

04:37.779 --> 04:40.047
Remember when I offended
stubborn people?

04:40.082 --> 04:41.949
That took forever
to sort out.

04:41.984 --> 04:42.950
Well, Tracy,

04:42.985 --> 04:44.018
I know you don't want me

04:44.036 --> 04:45.019
writing an apology for you.

04:45.037 --> 04:46.737
That's terrific, thank you.

04:46.788 --> 04:48.222
Aww.

04:50.742 --> 04:52.076
Lemon.

04:52.127 --> 04:54.195
I'm on top of the Tracy thing.
I just spoke to him...

04:54.229 --> 04:59.083
Actually, I want to talk
to you about something else.

04:59.134 --> 05:01.219
Because of my unfortunate
situation with Avery,

05:01.253 --> 05:02.670
I'm alone.

05:02.704 --> 05:04.005
And I know, of course,
that you're not seeing anyone,

05:04.039 --> 05:07.208
therefore I've decided
that you and I

05:07.242 --> 05:08.609
should become
friends with benefits.

05:08.644 --> 05:10.778
No, thank you, please.

05:10.812 --> 05:12.813
Aha! The only reason
you would reject that offer

05:12.848 --> 05:14.248
is if you had
a secret boyfriend.

05:14.283 --> 05:16.784
Right,
that's the only reason.

05:16.818 --> 05:18.152
I saw you, Lemon.
At the movies, last night,

05:18.186 --> 05:20.571
with your mouth on a man.

05:22.241 --> 05:23.891
Why would you
keep this from me

05:23.909 --> 05:25.326
after all
of our time together?

05:25.360 --> 05:28.246
This is hurtful, Elizabeth.

05:28.280 --> 05:29.263
What's his name?

05:29.298 --> 05:30.998
I don't want to tell you.

05:31.033 --> 05:32.166
Why?
Is it a stupid name,

05:32.200 --> 05:34.268
like "Dakota" or "Barack"?

05:34.303 --> 05:35.736
His name is "Chris,"

05:35.771 --> 05:36.904
and I'm sorry,
but for my own reasons...

05:36.922 --> 05:38.339
And "Chris" is spelled?

05:38.373 --> 05:41.125
No "h" and two "s"s.

05:41.176 --> 05:43.410
That! Right there, that's
why I didn't want to tell you,

05:43.428 --> 05:45.613
because I knew you
wouldn't approve of him.

05:45.647 --> 05:46.814
Why? What does
he do for a living?

05:46.848 --> 05:48.349
Criss is trying to...

05:48.383 --> 05:50.250
You can stop right there.

05:50.269 --> 05:51.936
He's an entrepreneur.
He's currently meeting with

05:51.970 --> 05:53.471
investors in the
hopes of starting an

05:53.522 --> 05:55.423
organic gourmet
hot dog truck.

05:55.457 --> 05:57.959
Lemon, I have said
"good God" to you before,

05:57.993 --> 06:00.461
but I don't think
I've ever meant it until now.

06:00.495 --> 06:02.096
Good God!

06:02.114 --> 06:03.297
Where does this person live?

06:03.332 --> 06:05.766
- Don't worry about it.
- How bad can it be?

06:05.801 --> 06:09.003
Jersey city?
His parents' apartment?

06:09.037 --> 06:10.838
It's not a walk-up, is it?

06:10.872 --> 06:13.641
He's actually been living
with me for the past month.

06:13.675 --> 06:15.576
Ah.

06:15.611 --> 06:18.296
No, I am not engaging,
I am not inviting input, Jack,

06:18.330 --> 06:19.463
because Criss is different.

06:19.498 --> 06:20.748
How is he different?

06:20.782 --> 06:21.816
Well, that's just
a stupid question.

06:21.850 --> 06:23.651
I mean,
I'm more relaxed around him.

06:23.685 --> 06:27.855
My jaw stopped popping.
Listen.

06:27.889 --> 06:30.391
And for once I'm not
overthinking everything,

06:30.425 --> 06:32.960
which is why
I don't want you in my head.

06:32.978 --> 06:35.730
Ah, but I'm already
in your head, Lemon.

06:35.764 --> 06:37.648
The fact that you felt
you had to keep "Chris,"

06:37.683 --> 06:40.468
and I'm saying his name
with an "h" and only one "s",

06:40.502 --> 06:43.704
the fact that you
kept him from me simply proves

06:43.739 --> 06:45.339
that it doesn't matter
whether I meet him or not.

06:45.374 --> 06:46.907
You already know
what I would say,

06:46.942 --> 06:48.509
and you know I'm right.

06:48.543 --> 06:49.744
I'm ignoring you.
You're not here.

06:49.778 --> 06:51.479
- Who's not here, Liz?
- I don't know, Liz.

06:51.513 --> 06:53.664
- I love you.
- Oh, I love you too.

06:53.699 --> 06:55.315
So I might as well
meet him and get it over with.

06:55.334 --> 06:56.450
I'll probably love him.

06:56.485 --> 06:58.502
After all,
we're both Princeton men.

06:58.537 --> 07:01.155
Princeton?
No, Criss went to... no!

07:01.173 --> 07:03.257
I am on to you. I am not
going to talk about him.

07:03.291 --> 07:05.676
You can't keep me out.

07:13.166 --> 07:16.066
Oh, Ms. Maroney.
I'm afraid I have bad news.

07:16.166 --> 07:17.483
- Jenny McCarthy died?

07:17.518 --> 07:19.152
But who could have been
slowly poisoning her?

07:19.186 --> 07:20.920
Was she poisoned?
I have no way of knowing,

07:20.954 --> 07:22.054
because I'm
just hearing about it.

07:22.089 --> 07:24.223
No, ma'am,
I spoke to maintenance

07:24.258 --> 07:26.175
about replacing the
light bulbs in your room,

07:26.210 --> 07:31.330
but Mr. Subhas is refusing
to do any work for <i>TGS</i>

07:31.348 --> 07:32.899
until Mr. Jordan issues
an apology for his remarks.

07:32.933 --> 07:34.467
He also said
that he thinks, quote,

07:34.501 --> 07:36.769
"sexuality is a continuum,"
and he is but

07:36.804 --> 07:42.007
a voyager on a vast
ocean of pleasure.

07:42.025 --> 07:43.693
- This is unacceptable,
Kenneth.

07:43.727 --> 07:45.111
Do you understand
how important

07:45.145 --> 07:47.113
proper lighting
is to an actress?

07:47.147 --> 07:49.582
Especially now that I'm
officially a "B-list" celebrity,

07:49.616 --> 07:51.818
thanks to
<i>America's kids got singing.</i>

07:51.852 --> 07:54.320
Oh, congratulations,
Ms. Maroney.

07:54.354 --> 07:55.922
I just found out this morning,

07:55.956 --> 07:59.091
Teri Polo and Ving Rhames
called me at home.

07:59.126 --> 08:01.561
So what if a tour came by
and some Fanny pack fatty

08:01.595 --> 08:04.997
took a picture of me in my
poorly-lit dressing room?

08:05.031 --> 08:07.733
And then they put the
picture on the Internet?

08:07.768 --> 08:10.887
That can't happen.

08:10.921 --> 08:13.055
I need my special,
pink-gel fluorescents,

08:13.090 --> 08:14.440
and I need them now.

08:14.474 --> 08:17.209
But only maintenance
is allowed in the supply room.

08:17.227 --> 08:19.712
Kenneth, do this for me,

08:19.746 --> 08:21.814
someone I hope
you consider a friend,

08:21.849 --> 08:23.566
and who in return
thinks of you

08:23.600 --> 08:25.852
as sort of
an albino slave-monkey.

08:25.886 --> 08:27.904
Aw, you think of me?

08:27.938 --> 08:29.555
Mm-hmm.

08:29.590 --> 08:31.490
But I don't have a key.

08:31.525 --> 08:33.860
You think we need a key?

08:33.894 --> 08:35.895
I guess someone's never been
locked in a dog crate

08:35.913 --> 08:39.866
and thrown overboard for
displeasing the sheikh.

08:43.537 --> 08:47.123
A statement from <i>TGS</i> head
writer Elizabeth Lemon, adding...

08:47.174 --> 08:49.876
I gotta get a real headshot.

08:58.852 --> 09:00.436
In other news,
after lots of high financial...

09:00.470 --> 09:03.522
And now, I am
headed home for a "nooner,"

09:03.557 --> 09:09.428
which is what I call
having pancakes for lunch.

09:09.463 --> 09:12.064
Liz Lemon, did you just
call me an idiot on this TV?

09:12.098 --> 09:13.065
Yeah, but...

09:14.985 --> 09:17.837
And what exactly
is that supposed to mean?

09:17.871 --> 09:19.372
It means you're someone
who should know better,

09:19.406 --> 09:21.624
but you constantly
do stupid things.

09:21.658 --> 09:27.213
How dare you! I am nonplussed,
and that is the correct usage.

09:27.247 --> 09:28.915
You have offended
and humiliated me.

09:28.949 --> 09:30.149
Well, maybe now you
know how gay people felt

09:30.183 --> 09:32.919
when you suggested
that they sit around all day

09:32.953 --> 09:34.220
and look at their own junk.

09:34.254 --> 09:35.972
Wait.
Why don't they do that?

09:38.058 --> 09:40.626
Okay, you're right, L.L.
I do get how they felt.

09:40.644 --> 09:44.864
Insulted, marginalized,
and outraged.

09:44.898 --> 09:47.967
Which is why I'm going to do
exactly what they did

09:47.985 --> 09:50.853
and organize
a protest of this network.

09:50.904 --> 09:52.672
A protest? By whom?

09:52.706 --> 09:54.640
By idiots!

09:58.812 --> 10:00.112
What an idiot.

10:00.147 --> 10:02.365
All right, I'm out.

10:02.416 --> 10:03.649
I've been dealing
with Tracy all morning,

10:03.684 --> 10:05.451
and clearly this
is only going to get worse.

10:05.485 --> 10:07.753
Time to go into
Hornberger crisis mode.

10:07.788 --> 10:09.755
Is that when you cry
on the floor in your office?

10:09.790 --> 10:10.957
Nope, I do that
when I see myself

10:10.991 --> 10:12.291
in the mirror on my birthday.

10:12.326 --> 10:16.662
Crisis mode is when I down
a couple of sleeping pills

10:16.697 --> 10:19.365
with scotch, pass out
in my secret napping place,

10:19.399 --> 10:21.851
and hope I dream about
that latina security guard.

10:21.885 --> 10:23.869
The one you always
kiss on the mouth.

10:23.904 --> 10:25.504
That's normal in Guatemala.

10:25.522 --> 10:27.056
Oh.

10:29.142 --> 10:31.610
Picking a lock
is like riding a bike.

10:31.645 --> 10:32.862
They're both skills you need

10:32.896 --> 10:35.616
to escape the Atlanta Falcons'
equipment room.

10:37.534 --> 10:38.868
Hurry, Ms. Maroney.

10:38.902 --> 10:40.486
If Mr. Subhas
finds us in here,

10:40.520 --> 10:41.988
I don't even know
what he'll say,

10:42.022 --> 10:43.406
because I can't understand him.

10:43.457 --> 10:45.992
There!
My pink fluorescents.

10:46.026 --> 10:48.494
They're the same lights poultry
farms use to keep the birds

10:48.528 --> 10:50.413
from pecking each
other to death.

10:57.771 --> 10:59.705
Are you as turned on
as I am right now?

10:59.740 --> 11:01.841
Oh,
we have to clean this up.

11:01.875 --> 11:04.427
"Fluorescent lights
contain Mercury."

11:04.478 --> 11:05.478
That's poisonous.

11:05.512 --> 11:07.246
I'm well aware
of that, Kenneth.

11:07.280 --> 11:09.415
I faked Mercury poisoning
to get out of my contract

11:09.449 --> 11:10.816
- <i>- The musical.</i>

11:10.851 --> 11:14.820
"If broken, remove all people
and pets from the room"?

11:14.855 --> 11:16.072
Why? Are there fumes?

11:16.106 --> 11:18.324
Are we breathing
Mercury fumes right now?

11:18.358 --> 11:21.911
Kenneth. I'm going to tell you
what I told Phil Spector.

11:21.945 --> 11:23.529
"It's gonna be okay, baby.

11:23.563 --> 11:24.864
"We just have
to get some trash bags

11:24.898 --> 11:27.133
"and get back here
before anyone's the wiser.

11:27.167 --> 11:29.035
Then we can keep
recording my album."

11:42.933 --> 11:45.084
Oh, come on, Subhas.

11:45.118 --> 11:49.588
Got to keep daddy's
special sleepy-place clean.

11:50.991 --> 11:54.110
Hey, so check this out.

11:54.144 --> 11:56.729
I think I saw Billy Dee Williams
in riverside park this morning

11:56.763 --> 11:57.763
when I was meeting dogs.

11:59.800 --> 12:02.234
Now that seems like a good use
of time for a busy entrepreneur.

12:02.269 --> 12:06.772
Hello, Lemon.
Chew with your mouth closed.

12:06.807 --> 12:08.908
So, question about
Lando Calrissian...

12:08.942 --> 12:10.142
Is that an Armenian name?

12:10.177 --> 12:11.644
Is he a space Armenian?

12:11.678 --> 12:13.045
I don't know.

12:13.080 --> 12:14.880
The Kardashians are Armenian,
they're into black guys,

12:14.915 --> 12:17.116
so there's something to it...

12:17.150 --> 12:18.818
I like how his voice goes up

12:18.852 --> 12:21.520
at the ends of sentences.

12:21.555 --> 12:24.456
That's very masculine.

12:24.474 --> 12:28.027
Oh, my. Is that a tan line
on Criss' thumb?

12:28.061 --> 12:30.362
Did Criss used
to wear a thumb ring?

12:35.185 --> 12:36.335
Oh, better hold on
to this one.

12:36.369 --> 12:39.138
He's getting
a free muffin soon.

12:39.156 --> 12:44.343
Wow, I've never seen a
sunglass hut credit card before.

12:46.980 --> 12:50.649
Oh, a ukulele with an
Obama sticker on it.

12:50.667 --> 12:55.004
Hmm.
 this guy might suck

12:55.038 --> 12:57.339
That was a gift
from Criss' kickball team.

12:57.374 --> 12:58.491
Well,
I think I've seen enough.

13:01.461 --> 13:02.995
Which totally supports your
theory that the phillie phanatic

13:03.029 --> 13:04.547
is biologically a female.

13:04.598 --> 13:05.764
Oh, yeah,
if you watch those games,

13:05.799 --> 13:08.000
that thing definitely
has a menstrual cycle.

13:08.018 --> 13:10.853
- Right?
- You gonna put on pants today?

13:10.887 --> 13:13.672
Eh.

13:13.707 --> 13:16.358
I'm in your head.

13:27.383 --> 13:30.851
We're here, we're proud,
I came up with this rhyme!

13:31.376 --> 13:33.662
You brought this on yourself,
Liz Lemon.

13:33.694 --> 13:36.495
The so-called idiot community
will not be silenced.

13:36.581 --> 13:38.165
For God's sake, Tracy.

13:38.199 --> 13:40.868
We are legion.
We are America.

13:40.902 --> 13:44.905
Frat guys, DJs,
loud-mouthed old bitches,

13:44.923 --> 13:47.708
investment bankers,
the tramp-stamped,

13:47.742 --> 13:50.544
parrot-heads,
anti-vaccination crusaders,

13:50.578 --> 13:53.597
and people who won't
shut up about scuba diving.

13:53.631 --> 13:55.599
It's a whole
other world down there.

13:55.633 --> 13:57.801
And our celebrity
spokesperson,

13:57.852 --> 13:59.469
actress Denise Richards.

14:02.106 --> 14:06.977
That's right.
I'm an idiot. Surprised?

14:07.028 --> 14:10.464
Well, I am.
For all "intensive purposes."

14:10.498 --> 14:12.983
Our community
is mobilized now, L.L.

14:13.034 --> 14:14.701
And we're not leaving
until we're heard.

14:16.838 --> 14:18.605
You can't ignore us,
Liz Lemon.

14:18.623 --> 14:22.826
We will be out here every day,
misremembering movie quotes.

14:22.877 --> 14:25.412
Because as Braveheart said,

14:25.446 --> 14:28.632
"you can take our freedom,
unless you take our lives."

14:31.169 --> 14:33.820
Say you approve
of Criss, Jack.

14:33.855 --> 14:35.689
Am I in your head, Lemon?

14:35.723 --> 14:37.290
Yes, but don't be so proud.

14:37.308 --> 14:38.992
I also have a lot
of imaginary arguments

14:39.027 --> 14:40.427
with the couples
on <i>house hunters.</i>

14:40.461 --> 14:42.663
Why can't people
look past paint color?

14:42.697 --> 14:44.231
Lemon, obviously
I can't approve of someone

14:44.265 --> 14:45.532
I've never met.

14:45.567 --> 14:46.833
Yeah, well, I'm not
letting you meet Criss,

14:46.868 --> 14:48.335
because you
won't approve of him.

14:48.369 --> 14:50.304
Well, then I guess
this is a catch-22.

14:50.338 --> 14:52.322
Although I don't know for sure,
because I refuse to read

14:52.357 --> 14:54.324
literature that questions
the morality of war.

14:54.359 --> 14:56.910
Look, clearly
I hurt your feelings.

14:56.945 --> 14:59.363
You're upset that
I didn't tell you about Criss.

14:59.414 --> 15:01.665
No, no, no, I'm quite
over your subterfuge,

15:01.699 --> 15:04.868
although I do expect
a note of apology.

15:04.919 --> 15:07.454
And don't try to make it funny.
Just apologize.

15:07.488 --> 15:09.172
But I feel like
people expect comedy...

15:09.207 --> 15:10.357
They don't.

15:10.391 --> 15:13.043
It's exhausting.

15:13.094 --> 15:14.461
However, you're right that I am
having an emotional reaction.

15:14.495 --> 15:16.563
It's very frustrating
to watch someone I care about

15:16.598 --> 15:19.533
do something she clearly
knows is bad for her,

15:19.567 --> 15:22.002
like that week you wore
those blue contact lenses.

15:22.036 --> 15:25.472
I looked like Adriana Lima.

15:25.506 --> 15:26.840
And you don't know
that Criss is bad for me,

15:26.858 --> 15:28.191
and you never will.

15:28.226 --> 15:30.177
So you better get
on board the Criss train.

15:30.211 --> 15:33.397
Criss-a, Criss,
Criss, Criss-a,

15:33.448 --> 15:35.782
Criss-a, Criss-a,
Criss-a, Criss-a,

15:35.817 --> 15:37.684
Criss-a, Criss-a,
Criss-a, Criss-a,

15:37.719 --> 15:41.555
Criss train!

15:41.589 --> 15:42.556
Do you have any water?

15:42.590 --> 15:44.491
You know what, Lemon?

15:44.525 --> 15:49.863
Fine. You are
technically an adult.

15:49.897 --> 15:54.668
You can do
whatever you want.

15:54.702 --> 15:57.471
Really? So I won?

15:57.505 --> 15:58.755
With the train thing?

15:58.806 --> 16:01.375
I won't ask any
questions about Criss again.

16:01.409 --> 16:03.927
You promise?

16:03.978 --> 16:07.614
Promise.
With two "s"s.

16:07.649 --> 16:11.068
I would, however, like
to ask you why Tracy is outside

16:11.102 --> 16:13.420
cursing this network
on a megaphone.

16:13.454 --> 16:14.855
It's a good one, Jack.

16:14.889 --> 16:18.525
Tracy has organized a protest
of NBC by his fellow idiots.

16:18.559 --> 16:21.395
He what? No, no, no, no, no.
We need idiots.

16:21.429 --> 16:24.414
You certainly need idiots.

16:24.449 --> 16:25.949
Who do you think
is watching your show?

16:26.000 --> 16:28.702
Funky taste-makers?

16:28.736 --> 16:29.970
Black nerds,

16:30.004 --> 16:33.173
jet blue passengers
who fall asleep with the TV on,

16:33.207 --> 16:35.575
pets whose owners have died,
and, uh, idiots.

16:35.593 --> 16:36.943
You need to fix this.

16:36.978 --> 16:39.596
I don't know
what to say to those people.

16:39.630 --> 16:42.215
You wrote "remember
to DVR <i>Kendra"</i> on your hand.

16:42.250 --> 16:44.484
I think you can handle it.

16:44.519 --> 16:46.937
Ah, no, damn it.

16:46.971 --> 16:49.156
Now I gotta
pray for a marathon.

16:56.431 --> 17:01.568
Jiminy Cricket, copyright
Walt Disney company, 1940!

17:01.602 --> 17:06.289
Mr. Hornberger? Sir?

17:08.242 --> 17:09.509
Pete!

17:09.544 --> 17:13.296
It's Jenna!
The woman you're in love with!

17:13.330 --> 17:14.614
What's wrong with him?

17:14.632 --> 17:17.000
Is this because
of the Mercury?

17:17.050 --> 17:20.804
What does the box say?

17:20.838 --> 17:22.789
"For a complete catalog
of our lighting products,

17:22.807 --> 17:27.426
visit our website."
We need a computer.

17:27.462 --> 17:28.595
Poor Mr. Hornberger.

17:28.629 --> 17:30.497
He came in here to do
something for the show,

17:30.531 --> 17:32.298
something important,
and now look what we've done.

17:32.316 --> 17:35.369
What you've done.
You broke the lights.

17:35.403 --> 17:38.989
We have to get help.

17:43.077 --> 17:44.995
Are you out of your mind?

17:45.029 --> 17:47.547
We need to call security,
and an ambulance.

17:47.582 --> 17:48.882
Think, you fool.

17:48.916 --> 17:51.218
Imagine what the Internet
would do with this.

17:51.252 --> 17:53.920
"Maroney found in closet with
unconscious married man

17:53.955 --> 17:55.889
and inbred virgin."

17:55.923 --> 17:59.793
Again? No way.
I have too much to lose now.

17:59.827 --> 18:01.011
I am this close to becoming

18:01.045 --> 18:04.264
the spokeswoman for
the vaginal mesh industry.

18:04.298 --> 18:08.969
Vaginal mesh.
Nice try, prolapse.

18:09.003 --> 18:10.804
Now, if you want to take the
fall for this, be my guest.

18:10.838 --> 18:12.722
But I can't be
connected to it in any way.

18:12.774 --> 18:14.141
Take what fall?

18:14.175 --> 18:15.559
Oh, please.

18:15.610 --> 18:17.344
You said it yourself
how many rules we've broken.

18:17.378 --> 18:20.230
"B" and "E", theft and
destruction of company property.

18:20.281 --> 18:22.549
And who knows
what we've done to Pete.

18:22.583 --> 18:24.518
If anyone
connects you to this...

18:24.552 --> 18:26.586
I'll get fired.

18:26.621 --> 18:28.054
They'd kick me out of
the page program faster than

18:28.089 --> 18:31.158
a fella can come up
with folksy similes.

18:36.631 --> 18:39.166
No one can know
this was our fault.

18:39.200 --> 18:41.418
But we have to help
Mr. Hornberger.

18:41.469 --> 18:42.419
What do we do?

18:42.470 --> 18:43.503
I don't know.

18:43.538 --> 18:47.373
But I know someone who does.

18:49.427 --> 18:50.410
Talk to me.

18:50.445 --> 18:52.212
I'm on my way.

18:52.246 --> 18:54.047
Any idea what bus
I take to get there?

18:55.516 --> 18:57.284
'Cause I'm in Chinatown,
baby.

18:57.318 --> 18:59.052
Hi, this is
Tracy's cell phone.

18:59.086 --> 19:00.353
Dot com,
hold the steering wheel.

19:00.388 --> 19:02.522
I've got to leave
my outgoing message.

19:02.556 --> 19:04.291
What did I just hit?

19:04.325 --> 19:06.560
Was that a person?
Is that paint or blood?

19:06.594 --> 19:08.562
Dot com,
this did not happen.

19:08.596 --> 19:11.698
We take this to our graves!

19:11.732 --> 19:15.085
Tracy, uh, this is Liz.
Please call my office.

19:15.119 --> 19:17.120
My extension,
as you have pointed out,

19:17.171 --> 19:18.905
spells "anus" with an "I".

19:22.210 --> 19:24.511
- Hey, what's up?
- What time you coming home?

19:24.545 --> 19:29.449
Because I'm...
 taking you out to dinner

19:29.484 --> 19:30.884
What?

19:30.918 --> 19:33.620
I called sunglass hut and got
my credit limit raised to $80,

19:33.654 --> 19:35.989
plus, they told me I only needed
5,000 more shades points

19:36.023 --> 19:37.357
to get free lens wipes,

19:37.391 --> 19:38.825
and I haven't even gotten
to the good news yet.

19:38.860 --> 19:40.794
That's all awesome.
What happened?

19:40.828 --> 19:42.229
I got an investor
for the truck.

19:42.263 --> 19:44.981
I went over my whole business
plan, guy gave me ten grand.

19:45.032 --> 19:46.149
Oh, my God.

19:46.200 --> 19:47.667
Okay,
if you got it in cash,

19:47.702 --> 19:48.935
we can spread the money out
on the bed

19:48.953 --> 19:50.036
and kiss on top of it.

19:50.071 --> 19:51.788
But nothing more.
And I have a cold sore.

19:51.822 --> 19:54.074
Damn it.
No, it's a check.

19:54.108 --> 19:59.629
But look at it.
It's beautiful.

19:59.664 --> 20:05.151
It's him.

20:05.186 --> 20:08.788
Not cool.

20:12.373 --> 20:14.457
<i> Who's that man
behind the curtain </i>

20:14.475 --> 20:16.360
<i> His kiss
will make you certain </i>

20:16.394 --> 20:18.345
<i> of the one name
you'll be blurtin' </i>

20:18.396 --> 20:21.848
<i> during love-making</i>
