00:05.939 --> 00:11.410
Look at that
ninth-grade woman.
She's putting on makeup.

00:11.412 --> 00:14.179
We're going to be
ninth-grade women someday.

00:14.181 --> 00:17.216
This thing
goes to ninth grade?

00:18.184 --> 00:19.485
- Why that?
- Brings out your eyes.

00:19.487 --> 00:21.220
Why would I want
to take out my eyes?

00:21.222 --> 00:22.654
She's not
taking out her eyes.

00:23.957 --> 00:25.524
And I think she is.

00:25.526 --> 00:29.261
It's an eyelash curler.
It doesn't even hurt.

00:29.263 --> 00:31.497
( chuckles )
I have eyelashes.

00:31.499 --> 00:33.732
Watch this.

00:33.734 --> 00:36.668
- Ahh!
- Anybody else would stop.

00:36.670 --> 00:38.904
Ahh!

00:38.906 --> 00:41.340
- Open it.
- Thanks, daddy.

00:41.342 --> 00:42.674
Yeah, okay.

00:43.777 --> 00:45.444
Yeah, okay.

00:45.446 --> 00:51.583
School dance.  I'm gonna put
you both down for dance numbers
one through all of them.

00:51.585 --> 00:53.585
We will alternate.
You and me, me and you.

00:53.587 --> 00:56.855
When you are not dancing
with me, you may not
dance with anyone else.

00:56.857 --> 00:59.258
You may sit and wait
until you dance with me again.

00:59.260 --> 01:00.759
Yeah, none of this
is happening.

01:00.761 --> 01:02.728
Oh.  Well, then may I have one
dance with each of you?

01:02.730 --> 01:04.596
- Sure.
- Ha!  That's all I wanted.

01:04.598 --> 01:06.698
You just got played by farkle.

01:08.501 --> 01:09.968
- Hey, guys.
- Lucas!

01:09.970 --> 01:11.537
- Hand.
- Lucas!

01:11.539 --> 01:13.338
- Grown-up voice.
- Lucas, hello.

01:13.340 --> 01:15.407
- Hey.
- Hey, hee haw.

01:15.409 --> 01:16.842
You going to tick tock
shake your body time?

01:16.844 --> 01:19.244
'cause, you know,
it's not a square-dance,

01:19.246 --> 01:21.713
So not gonna be
a whole lot of do-si-doin'.

01:21.715 --> 01:25.017
Well, then I'm sure
I'll have no idea what to do
and you can make fun of me.

01:25.019 --> 01:26.685
You're not
playing this right!

01:26.687 --> 01:29.888
Well, that's certainly
not my intention.

01:29.890 --> 01:32.925
- I'll try harder next time.
- I will break you!

01:32.927 --> 01:34.293
Well, if that's
what makes you happy,

01:34.295 --> 01:37.996
Then I certainly
can't wait for it...

01:37.998 --> 01:39.298
Ma'am.

01:39.300 --> 01:44.369
- ( shuddering ) ohhhh!
- You going to the
school dance, lucas?

01:44.371 --> 01:46.038
Thought I would.  You?

01:46.040 --> 01:47.940
( mimics gagging )

01:47.942 --> 01:50.776
You hear me?
( mimics gagging )

01:50.778 --> 01:54.046
You'll both be there.
He'll be the one in the
cowboy hat going like this.

01:55.949 --> 01:57.983
( school bell rings )

01:57.985 --> 02:00.385
- So, you goin' to class?
- Thought I would. You?

02:03.590 --> 02:04.957
It isn't for you!

02:06.392 --> 02:08.594
Okay, fine.

Mom, can I ask you a question?

03:09.490 --> 03:12.057
You can ask me
a question.

03:12.059 --> 03:14.092
It's a girl thing, auggie.

03:14.094 --> 03:17.396
You think I don't
know about girls?

03:17.398 --> 03:20.065
- Okay, I'm at a certain age--
- I don't care.

03:23.036 --> 03:24.636
You're at a certain age?

03:24.638 --> 03:25.938
You had to know
this was going to happen.

03:25.940 --> 03:29.041
I know a lot of things
are going to happen.

03:29.043 --> 03:31.043
- Which one is this?
- Makeup.

03:31.045 --> 03:32.978
- Oh, good.
- I can have some?

03:32.980 --> 03:35.547
- No.
- Why not?

03:35.549 --> 03:38.016
Well, because makeup leads
to other things that--

03:38.018 --> 03:39.952
We have our first school dance
on Friday night.

03:39.954 --> 03:41.853
And we're there.

03:41.855 --> 03:44.489
Riley:
<i>What's the difference</i>
<i>between daytime makeup</i>

03:44.491 --> 03:45.490
<i>And nighttime makeup?</i>

03:45.492 --> 03:46.725
No difference...

03:46.727 --> 03:48.660
Because you're
not wearing any.

03:48.662 --> 03:50.095
Riley:
<i>What about when I do?</i>

03:50.097 --> 03:51.997
When we decide that
you're at the right age

03:51.999 --> 03:53.432
- To start wearing makeup--
- Friday?

03:53.434 --> 03:55.067
No--

03:55.069 --> 03:56.568
You might find that you prefer

03:56.570 --> 03:57.936
A more natural
look during the day.

03:57.938 --> 04:01.039
Some women prefer to go
a bit bolder at night.

04:01.041 --> 04:03.475
You are not allowed
to hang out with those women.

04:03.477 --> 04:06.478
I wanna paint my face!

04:06.480 --> 04:09.114
Wait.
The dance is Friday?

04:09.116 --> 04:10.616
You're doin' that thing
with your voice.

04:10.618 --> 04:12.017
But Friday is the last night

04:12.019 --> 04:13.051
For the coney island cyclone.

04:13.053 --> 04:15.053
But it's our first dance!

04:15.055 --> 04:18.056
And dad takes me to ride
the roller coaster
a bunch of times, right?

04:18.058 --> 04:20.192
Your father thinks
of it as a tradition.

04:20.194 --> 04:22.628
- How bad is this?
- Your father thinks of it
as the reason

04:22.630 --> 04:24.997
He wakes up in the morning.

04:24.999 --> 04:26.898
Maybe he won't
remember it this year.

04:26.900 --> 04:29.968
Three days till cyclone day!

04:31.437 --> 04:33.538
- When's my birthday?
- A hundred forty-eight days

04:33.540 --> 04:37.142
- From cyclone day!
- Good luck to you.

04:37.144 --> 04:39.044
- Daddy!
- Auggie!

04:39.046 --> 04:42.914
Hey!
Tell me stuff!

04:42.916 --> 04:44.583
Riley wants to wear makeup.

04:44.585 --> 04:48.520
- Hey, ya little spy!
- Don't call him a spy.

04:48.522 --> 04:49.955
He is not a spy.

04:49.957 --> 04:52.991
I am a spy.
You made me a card.

04:54.661 --> 04:56.094
All right, he is a spy.

04:56.096 --> 04:58.463
And guess what?
He's working for me.

04:58.465 --> 05:00.632
And he just got promoted.

05:03.102 --> 05:05.070
Superspy!

05:05.072 --> 05:07.873
- Dad.
- Yeah?

05:07.875 --> 05:10.876
Dad...?

05:10.878 --> 05:13.745
Hey, superspy,
tell me stuff.

05:13.747 --> 05:16.181
Riley wants to go
to the school dance on--

05:16.183 --> 05:19.151
Dun dun dun--
cyclone night.

05:20.153 --> 05:22.621
Oh.  Wow.

05:22.623 --> 05:24.690
It's the same night?

05:24.692 --> 05:26.091
I understand.

05:26.093 --> 05:29.027
I understand completely.

05:29.029 --> 05:30.862
I'm sorry you'll have
to miss the dance.

05:32.265 --> 05:34.266
Try again.

05:34.268 --> 05:35.801
( clears throat )

05:35.803 --> 05:38.203
I'm sorry you'll have
to miss the dance.

05:38.205 --> 05:40.739
Nope, same thing.

05:41.808 --> 05:44.009
But it's my first dance, dad.

05:44.011 --> 05:47.612
- Oh!
- Oh, boy.

05:47.614 --> 05:50.816
No, no, I'm down with this.

05:50.818 --> 05:53.085
Yeah, I said that.

05:53.087 --> 05:56.555
Dad, when it comes to this
stuff, I don't think there's
anything you can teach me.

05:56.557 --> 05:59.157
- Oh, boy!
- ( groans loudly )

05:59.159 --> 06:00.992
I'm growing up, dad.

06:00.994 --> 06:04.963
- Oh, boy!
- Goodbye!

06:06.032 --> 06:07.766
You're breaking him!

06:09.635 --> 06:11.737
You were a great father
to me when I was a kid.

06:11.739 --> 06:14.206
Don't take this
the wrong way, dad,

06:14.208 --> 06:17.576
But there's just some things
that mom can naturally teach me.

06:17.578 --> 06:19.211
Like, what do you
know about makeup?

06:21.013 --> 06:23.181
I know it's what you're
going to have to do with me.

06:27.186 --> 06:30.956
- Mom?
- That went better
than I thought.

06:35.094 --> 06:38.930
Friar.  Farkle.  Hart.

06:38.932 --> 06:40.899
You.

06:40.901 --> 06:43.001
- Dad, I didn't--
- ferp!

06:43.003 --> 06:45.771
Okay.

06:48.207 --> 06:51.576
Well, guys, I've got
your test results on darwin
to give back to you.

06:51.578 --> 06:56.314
And, uh, I'm pleased
to see some of you have
evolved since the last quiz.

06:58.885 --> 06:59.985
Ha!

07:01.954 --> 07:03.155
Thanks, farkle.

07:03.157 --> 07:04.956
Well, you were drowning, sir.

07:08.161 --> 07:09.961
Ms. Hart.

07:12.231 --> 07:14.366
<i>Mr. Friar, nice work.</i>

07:14.368 --> 07:18.036
- Thank you, sir.
- Mr. Farkle.

07:18.038 --> 07:20.972
"a" number seven hundred.
Huzzah!

07:20.974 --> 07:22.774
( blows noisemaker )

07:24.677 --> 07:26.244
You.

07:26.246 --> 07:30.015
- You okay?
- He gave me an "f."

07:30.017 --> 07:33.652
That's nuts.
You're a solid "d" student.

07:35.054 --> 07:38.023
Mr. Friar, I took particular
note of your position

07:38.025 --> 07:42.027
That evolution does not
preclude the existence of--
how did you put it?

07:42.029 --> 07:45.964
"a guiding hand that has your
best interest at heart."

07:47.166 --> 07:50.735
- Yes, ms. Hart?
- You failed me.

07:53.906 --> 07:55.841
Why don't we talk
about this after class.

07:55.843 --> 08:00.145
What's there to talk about?
You failed me.

08:00.147 --> 08:02.814
You think I'm a failure.

08:04.183 --> 08:06.117
There's nothing more
for you to teach me.

08:07.186 --> 08:10.155
Oh, come on!
Both of you gotta say that?

08:15.161 --> 08:16.761
What, you mean
I lost you both?

08:16.763 --> 08:19.998
Maya!

08:20.000 --> 08:21.666
You do not walk out of here!

08:29.242 --> 08:30.442
Go.

08:37.850 --> 08:39.284
No!

08:42.922 --> 08:44.222
Redecorating your locker?

08:44.224 --> 08:47.392
Nope. Cleaning it out.

08:47.394 --> 08:50.095
You want one? 'cause it's
the last one you're gonna get.

08:51.264 --> 08:54.432
-  <i>( circus music plays )</i>
<i>- </i> <i>( whirs )</i>

08:57.169 --> 08:59.104
Maya, it's just one "f."

08:59.106 --> 09:02.173
It's not about
the paper, riley.
Your dad failed me.

09:02.175 --> 09:06.011
Yeah, I know. And I'm
not going on the cyclone.
I failed him.

09:06.013 --> 09:09.314
- Can't we just call it even?
- No.  We can just call it
I'm leaving.

09:09.316 --> 09:12.050
Maya, I know you.
You'll make a big deal
about this,

09:12.052 --> 09:14.986
Pretend to leave school forever,
and you'll be back by gym class.

09:14.988 --> 09:19.190
- No, this time I mean it.
- All right, maya.
I'll see you tomorrow.

09:19.192 --> 09:22.027
- No.  You won't.
- You'll pick me up at 7:00.

09:22.029 --> 09:24.329
I won't be there.

09:28.334 --> 09:31.736
Riley on computer:
<i>Hold me, daddy!</i>
<i>Daddy, hold me!</i>

09:31.738 --> 09:33.905
Cory:
I've got you, riley!

09:33.907 --> 09:37.976
- Riley: Daddy!
- ( screaming )

09:41.914 --> 09:44.082
You okay, buddy?

09:46.319 --> 09:49.087
I lost the two most
important girls in my life.

09:53.392 --> 09:55.493
How ya doin'?

09:55.495 --> 09:58.330
Still got that one.

09:58.332 --> 10:00.365
I'm hangin' on.

10:01.434 --> 10:04.002
Well, I will always
be here for you, daddy.

10:05.071 --> 10:07.772
Me and you,
together forever.

10:09.075 --> 10:10.542
Thank you, auggie.

10:10.544 --> 10:13.411
But you know that's really
not the way it works, right?

10:13.413 --> 10:15.113
I know.

10:15.115 --> 10:19.084
( both moaning )

10:19.086 --> 10:21.953
Aw, my two sad, little men.

10:21.955 --> 10:25.190
( whispering )
I'm not really sad,
I'm just doing it for him.

10:25.192 --> 10:27.025
( whispering ) I know.

10:27.027 --> 10:30.028
- ( whispering ) you got this?
- ( whispering ) I got it.

10:33.132 --> 10:37.035
You got it, topanga?
Are you gonna make this
all better?

10:41.107 --> 10:43.241
Riley on computer:
I'm okay, I'm okay, I'm okay.

10:43.243 --> 10:46.111
<i>Hold me, daddy! Daddy!</i>
<i>Hold me!</i>

10:46.113 --> 10:51.249
<i>- Daddy!</i>
<i>- ( screaming )</i>

10:54.954 --> 10:57.222
We always get the very
last ride of the season.

10:57.224 --> 11:01.092
And I know once we stop going,
we're never going back.

11:01.094 --> 11:02.894
Honey, it's just
for this year.

11:02.896 --> 11:06.031
No.  Topanga, this is
exactly how traditions end.

11:07.600 --> 11:10.168
Once we got moving on that
ride, you should've heard her:

11:10.170 --> 11:12.370
Whee! Ahhh!

11:13.939 --> 11:16.207
Whee!

11:16.209 --> 11:19.210
The best part was right
before the big drop.

11:19.212 --> 11:22.047
I mean, you're going up,
and it starts slowing down,

11:22.049 --> 11:23.448
But you know what's coming.

11:23.450 --> 11:25.917
Riley, she starts
leaning closer to me,

11:25.919 --> 11:30.055
She puts her arms
around me and holds on.

11:30.057 --> 11:32.257
What else is ever gonna
be like that?

11:32.259 --> 11:34.626
Life.

11:34.628 --> 11:38.063
Oh, besides that.

11:38.065 --> 11:41.533
Cory, her first dance is hardly
the end of your relationship.

11:41.535 --> 11:44.335
She said I have
nothing left to teach her.

11:45.371 --> 11:48.473
Our daddy-daughter
story is... Over.

11:49.408 --> 11:52.143
Her and maya, gone.

11:52.145 --> 11:54.646
They moved on without me.

11:54.648 --> 11:56.548
They both got married.

11:58.217 --> 12:00.085
They have children now.

12:00.087 --> 12:03.955
They live in california,
by some other roller coaster.

12:03.957 --> 12:06.224
Please.  You know,
no matter what,

12:06.226 --> 12:08.660
You are always
going to be there.

12:08.662 --> 12:12.063
I mean, even if all someone
wants is a little bit
of alone time,

12:12.065 --> 12:14.332
Which is normal
for a woman,

12:14.334 --> 12:16.267
You are there.

12:19.238 --> 12:21.039
Always.

12:22.975 --> 12:25.410
California.

12:30.449 --> 12:33.118
You made your point, okay?

12:33.120 --> 12:35.954
You didn't come to school today
and your teacher is
really upset with you.

12:35.956 --> 12:40.091
He's not my teacher anymore.
I now attend a prestigious
online academy.

12:40.093 --> 12:44.229
<i>( man with brooklyn accent )</i>
<i>welcome to the frank mantucci</i>
<i>on da computer school,</i>

12:44.231 --> 12:47.632
<i>Where youse get out of it</i>
<i>what you put into it.</i>

12:47.634 --> 12:49.067
<i>And what you need</i>
<i>to put into it</i>

12:49.069 --> 12:51.569
<i>Is 400 dollars.</i>
<i>Gimme.</i>

12:52.505 --> 12:54.973
- You paid that?
- Free trial.

12:54.975 --> 12:57.108
I took the test to see if I
qualify for the free trial.

12:57.110 --> 12:59.277
Maya, it's a scam!
They take anybody!

12:59.279 --> 13:02.247
- Man:  <i>Congratulations!</i>
<i>- I got in!</i>

13:02.249 --> 13:05.150
Man:
<i>You are the first person</i>
<i>to ever fail</i>

13:05.152 --> 13:09.053
<i>The frank mantucci</i>
<i>on da computer school.</i>

13:09.055 --> 13:11.956
-  <i>How'd you do dat?</i>
<i>- ( mimics ) how'd you do dat?</i>

13:11.958 --> 13:16.060
Man:
<i>We asked: "name?"</i>
<i>you didn't put nuttin'.</i>

13:16.062 --> 13:18.696
Well, at least you
were smart enough not
to give them your name.

13:18.698 --> 13:21.166
- It's not that
I'm smart enough.
- Then what is it?

13:21.168 --> 13:24.169
Maybe sometimes...

13:24.171 --> 13:26.104
I'm not so proud
of who I am.

13:26.106 --> 13:29.040
- ( door opens)
- how's it going in here?

13:29.042 --> 13:33.678
Mom, tell maya
to come back to school--
regular school.

13:33.680 --> 13:36.047
Hm... So you don't
like this, huh?

13:36.049 --> 13:39.150
Of course not!  Maya always
comes to school with me!

13:39.152 --> 13:42.220
She always picks me up at 7:00.
I look forward to it!

13:42.222 --> 13:46.224
- Like a tradition?
- Yeah!  Oh...

13:46.226 --> 13:47.325
You know, even though
you're a mother,

13:47.327 --> 13:49.093
That was creepy good.

13:51.030 --> 13:52.997
So, maya doesn't show up
like she's supposed to

13:52.999 --> 13:54.666
And how does
that make you feel?

13:54.668 --> 13:57.202
Oh...

13:57.204 --> 13:59.671
Honey, you have
to go to him.

13:59.673 --> 14:02.507
He feels bad.
You have to go to your father.

14:03.509 --> 14:05.743
I feel bad.
Will he come to me?

14:05.745 --> 14:09.414
No. He's your teacher.
He doesn't have to.

14:09.416 --> 14:11.482
- But he will.
- What?

14:11.484 --> 14:14.152
He doesn't have to,
but he will.

14:14.154 --> 14:17.021
- Why?
- Because he's always there.

14:17.023 --> 14:18.089
( door opens )

14:27.132 --> 14:28.700
Always.

14:36.275 --> 14:38.643
- Read it.
- I don't want to do this,
mr. Matthews.

14:38.645 --> 14:40.612
- Sit down.
- You can't tell me--

14:40.614 --> 14:41.679
I just did.

14:44.216 --> 14:46.050
Thanks.

14:47.553 --> 14:49.187
Go ahead.

14:51.523 --> 14:53.591
"darwin animal studies
were thought to be

14:53.593 --> 14:55.660
When the travels he took on
the boat with the beatles."

14:55.662 --> 14:58.129
Are you kidding me?

14:58.131 --> 14:59.631
Does she have to be here?

14:59.633 --> 15:01.733
What were
you trying to do?

15:01.735 --> 15:04.202
I tried to write it
like I was smart.

15:04.204 --> 15:05.570
You are smart.

15:05.572 --> 15:07.205
What did you mean to say?

15:07.207 --> 15:09.374
Darwin studied animals.

15:09.376 --> 15:11.142
- What kind?
- I don't know.

15:11.144 --> 15:12.543
- She does know.
- I don't know.

15:12.545 --> 15:16.648
- But you don't know that!
- You know what?

15:17.816 --> 15:21.219
- What did darwin study?
- Birds.

15:21.221 --> 15:25.423
- There you go.
- Really?  I got that one wrong.

15:26.558 --> 15:28.192
You want to be smart, maya?

15:28.194 --> 15:30.094
Say what you mean.

15:30.096 --> 15:32.664
I understood that perfectly,
and you're correct.

15:32.666 --> 15:35.733
- That's all I had to say?
- What was the name of his boat?

15:35.735 --> 15:37.201
The beatles.

15:38.671 --> 15:40.638
The beagle.
It's a tiny difference,

15:40.640 --> 15:42.874
But an important one.

15:42.876 --> 15:45.710
Because if you know it,
maya, you don't fail.

15:46.612 --> 15:48.179
I want to not fail.

15:48.181 --> 15:50.248
What kind of birds
did he study?

15:50.250 --> 15:51.416
- I don't know.
- You do.

15:51.418 --> 15:52.417
- Finches.
- And what else?

15:52.419 --> 15:54.252
Finches and mockingbirds.

15:54.254 --> 15:56.754
- Yes.
- Yes.

15:56.756 --> 15:59.490
- How did you know she knew?
- I know she listens to you.

16:00.426 --> 16:02.393
I listen to you.

16:03.295 --> 16:05.563
Then you won't fail...

16:05.565 --> 16:07.165
And then neither will I.

16:08.233 --> 16:11.135
How about
some turkey sandwiches?

16:11.137 --> 16:12.704
Darwin didn't study turkeys.

16:12.706 --> 16:15.273
He studied finches
and mockingbirds.

16:15.275 --> 16:16.574
His boat was the beagle.

16:16.576 --> 16:19.544
- And for extra credit?
- Galapagos.

16:19.546 --> 16:21.446
The islands he studied
were the galapagos.

16:21.448 --> 16:23.514
Because she listens to me.

16:25.351 --> 16:27.652
Hey, maya.

16:27.654 --> 16:29.187
Watch this.

16:30.823 --> 16:32.623
You're giving me an "a"?

16:32.625 --> 16:36.394
No, I'm giving you
a "c plus."

16:36.396 --> 16:40.531
But I want you to see how
easily an "f" can become an "a."

16:41.667 --> 16:44.369
Nothing to be ashamed
of anymore, maya.

16:45.904 --> 16:49.273
- My dad doesn't live with--
- it's okay.

16:50.442 --> 16:52.577
He's got this new family.

16:52.579 --> 16:55.279
- Maya, you don't have to--
- I do have to.

16:55.281 --> 16:57.482
I have to be able
to talk to you.

16:58.917 --> 17:01.452
If you give me an "f,"

17:01.454 --> 17:04.655
If you decide I'm not
worth working on--

17:04.657 --> 17:07.392
Maya, take a look around you.

17:07.394 --> 17:10.461
We're all here for you.

17:10.463 --> 17:13.731
Does this look like we think
you're not worth working on?

17:13.733 --> 17:17.702
I just don't want to fail,
mr. Matthews.

17:19.304 --> 17:20.505
Thank you.

17:21.874 --> 17:23.441
I don't want
to go to the dance!

17:23.443 --> 17:25.610
The dance doesn't
matter to me at all!

17:25.612 --> 17:29.280
I want to go on the cyclone
with you more than
anything in the world!

17:29.282 --> 17:32.817
- You're going to the dance.
- ( breathily ) hooray!

17:32.819 --> 17:34.986
I'm going to chaperone.

17:34.988 --> 17:37.522
- What's that mean?
- Grown-up voice.

17:37.524 --> 17:40.358
Lucas, hello.

17:40.926 --> 17:42.360
What's that mean?

17:44.430 --> 17:48.699
( soft pop music plays )

17:53.672 --> 17:55.473
You're a really
good dancer, lucas.

17:55.475 --> 17:57.008
Thanks, so are you.

17:57.010 --> 17:59.243
Look, everyone's copying us.

18:04.883 --> 18:06.918
The hat's just
for me, isn't it?

18:06.920 --> 18:09.487
You actually put thought into
our little game, don't you?

18:09.489 --> 18:11.756
I actually do.

18:12.958 --> 18:15.359
( shudders )

18:15.361 --> 18:16.461
( shudders )

18:21.967 --> 18:24.802
( music ends )

18:28.006 --> 18:30.741
Well, guys, it looks like
the night is winding down.

18:30.743 --> 18:32.410
We hope you all
enjoyed the dance.

18:32.412 --> 18:35.046
But before we go, I notice
some fathers have arrived

18:35.048 --> 18:36.514
To pick up their daughters.

18:36.516 --> 18:39.050
I wonder if we might
have one last dance.

18:39.052 --> 18:43.321
( cheering )

18:44.957 --> 18:46.791
A father-daughter dance.

18:48.360 --> 18:51.596
( soft music plays )

18:58.737 --> 19:00.938
May I please
have this dance?

19:08.413 --> 19:13.518
♪ ever you needed to talk

19:13.520 --> 19:15.953
♪ you can talk to me

19:15.955 --> 19:19.790
♪ could you talk to me

19:19.792 --> 19:22.360
Looks like maybe
we have a new tradition.

19:22.362 --> 19:24.562
That's okay.

19:24.564 --> 19:27.665
Traditions are supposed
to evolve...

19:27.667 --> 19:29.033
Just like daughters.

19:29.035 --> 19:32.537
Sometimes daughters just need...

19:33.539 --> 19:35.573
What was that again, mr. Friar?

19:35.575 --> 19:38.910
"a guiding hand that has your
best interest at heart."

19:41.046 --> 19:44.448
There's still a whole lot
I need you to teach me, dad.

19:45.517 --> 19:47.451
Thank you, riley.

19:47.453 --> 19:50.521
There's still a whole lot
I need you to teach me, too.

19:50.523 --> 19:53.124
- Hey, he's my father.
- Whatever you say.

19:53.126 --> 19:56.527
You do know that you're
my father, right?

19:56.529 --> 19:59.363
Yeah, I'm your father.

20:00.499 --> 20:01.899
Thank you, riley.

20:01.901 --> 20:05.937
- How's that for make-up?
- Perfect.

20:22.921 --> 20:26.824
Riley, I never want our
daddy-daughter story to end.

20:26.826 --> 20:29.527
- Neither do I, dad.
- It doesn't end.

20:29.529 --> 20:32.430
In any good book,
you turn the page
and there's another chapter.

20:32.432 --> 20:36.901
Daddy, since riley's too big
for you, maybe we could
do something every year.

20:39.004 --> 20:41.672
Of course, auggie.
What do you have in mind?

20:41.674 --> 20:44.942
You and me.
A singles cruise to alaska.

20:46.545 --> 20:49.113
Well, I guess some traditions
are meant to change.

20:49.115 --> 20:51.983
- ( door opens )
- 'sup, goofballs?

20:51.985 --> 20:53.618
Hey, riley, 7:00.

20:57.055 --> 20:59.624
And some should
always remain the same.
