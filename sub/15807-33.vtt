¶ Just sit right back
    and you'll hear a tale ¶

00:06.340 --> 00:08.306
¶ A tale of a fateful trip ¶

00:08.375 --> 00:10.309
¶ That started from
      this tropic port ¶

00:10.377 --> 00:12.844
¶ Aboard this tiny ship ¶

00:12.913 --> 00:15.346
¶ The mate was
     a mighty sailin' man ¶

00:15.415 --> 00:17.616
¶ The Skipper brave and sure ¶

00:17.685 --> 00:20.152
¶ Five passengers
      set sail that day ¶

00:20.220 --> 00:22.320
¶ For a three hour tour ¶

00:22.389 --> 00:25.590
¶ A three hour tour ¶

00:25.659 --> 00:27.292
[thunder rumbling]

00:27.361 --> 00:28.994
¶ The weather started
     getting rough ¶

00:29.063 --> 00:31.296
¶ The tiny ship was tossed ¶

00:31.364 --> 00:33.899
¶ If not for the courage
    of the fearless crew ¶

00:33.968 --> 00:36.001
¶ The Minnow would be lost ¶

00:36.070 --> 00:39.237
¶ The Minnow would be lost ¶

00:39.306 --> 00:41.339
¶ The ship set ground
     on the shore ¶

00:41.408 --> 00:43.908

      desert isle ¶

01:17.411 --> 01:19.644
Gilligan, you got something big
at the end of the line.

01:19.713 --> 01:21.046
Hang on to it.

01:21.114 --> 01:24.015
Wait. I'll be down there
    and help you.

01:24.084 --> 01:26.118
'Hang on, Gilligan.
      Keep pulling.'

01:26.186 --> 01:28.220
'I'm coming, Gilligan.
Hang on.'

01:28.289 --> 01:30.455
- Let me take over.
     - Sure, Skipper. Sure.

01:30.524 --> 01:33.625
It's a huge fish. There will be
 enough food for a week.

01:33.694 --> 01:35.427
[pulley screeching]

01:40.567 --> 01:43.468
"Food for a week." It's not
a fish. It's a box.

01:43.537 --> 01:45.337
Well-well, we can have
          a box lunch.

01:45.406 --> 01:47.472
Very funny, Gilligan.
Very funny.

01:47.541 --> 01:49.474
Well, come on.
Help me pull it in.

01:49.543 --> 01:51.710
So we can see
what's in it.

01:51.778 --> 01:53.111
[grunting]

01:53.179 --> 01:55.681
Watch your fingers.

01:55.749 --> 01:57.816
Let's get it.

01:57.884 --> 01:59.818
[gasping]

02:01.989 --> 02:03.856
Pull! Heave!

02:05.191 --> 02:06.624
I wonder what's in it.

02:06.693 --> 02:08.627
I don't know. It's such a big
crate. It could be anything.

02:08.695 --> 02:12.263
No, it couldn't be anything.
It couldn't be Denver, Colorado.

02:12.332 --> 02:15.567
No, Gilligan.
It couldn't be Denver, Colorado.

02:17.871 --> 02:21.672
- Skipper. It says, Raft.
   - Raft! Raft!

02:21.741 --> 02:23.441
We're saved, Gilligan.
     We're saved.

02:23.510 --> 02:26.511
It might be an inflatable raft.
We can get off the island.

02:26.579 --> 02:29.414
[screaming]
          Yeah. Yeah.

02:33.987 --> 02:35.420
- Yeah.
    - Maybe it's gotta sail.

02:35.489 --> 02:37.656
We can step up side
and the sail catch the wind..

02:37.724 --> 02:39.390
Wait till you hear
what's in this box..

02:39.459 --> 02:42.060
Yeah, Professor, a great big
raft. The raft in the island.

02:42.129 --> 02:45.063
Now, wait a minute. Wait a
    minute. It doesn't say <i> raft.</i>

02:45.132 --> 02:49.234
It says
      The Great...Raftini.

02:50.370 --> 02:51.870
What's a <i> Great Raftini?</i>

02:51.939 --> 02:54.106
I don't know but it's better
    than a small raftini.

02:54.174 --> 02:56.908
Sounds like somebody's name.
This could've fallen off a ship.

02:56.977 --> 02:59.477
Yeah, a ship to
   Australia, Japan, India..

02:59.546 --> 03:01.013
- Gilligan?
 - ...France, England, Italy--

03:01.081 --> 03:03.414
Gilligan, would like to try
for the rest of the world?

03:03.483 --> 03:04.883
'May I make a suggestion?'

03:04.952 --> 03:09.487
Why don't we take it to the hut,
open it up and find out?

03:09.556 --> 03:11.156
Yeah, and maybe
          we'll be saved anyway.

03:11.225 --> 03:13.124
Maybe Raftini is Italian
        for raft.

03:13.193 --> 03:15.561
Yeah. Hey, let's get it
outta here.

03:17.030 --> 03:19.264
Gilligan, will you get
          the loose boards off?

03:19.333 --> 03:20.699
Let's get it off.

03:20.768 --> 03:22.133
Oh, told you that.

03:22.202 --> 03:24.269
Ha ha ha.
           Hello--

03:26.273 --> 03:27.372
What's going on?

03:27.440 --> 03:29.474
We found this box
down by the lagoon.

03:29.543 --> 03:30.742
Hopefully, something
to get us off the island.

03:30.810 --> 03:32.744
Would be great to be
            in a beauty shop.

03:32.813 --> 03:34.346
Well, that does it.

03:41.154 --> 03:43.021
Just what we needed.
            A full dress suit.

03:43.089 --> 03:44.556
Look at the bright side,
    Skipper.

03:44.624 --> 03:47.192
When we get off the island,
  one of us can go formal.

03:47.260 --> 03:48.727
Just as well be you.

03:53.066 --> 03:55.901
Skipper, there's
something alive.

03:55.970 --> 03:57.169
- 'Rabbit!'
        - Where? Where?

03:57.237 --> 03:58.836
(Ginger)
     'On top of your head.'

03:58.905 --> 04:01.106
(Professor)
  'Well, it must have come out
  of the hat.'

04:01.174 --> 04:04.977
Oh, shouldn't it.
       Watch this.

04:05.045 --> 04:08.312
Here as you'll see,
      is an ordinary cape.

04:08.381 --> 04:11.483
Nothing here.
         Nothing here.

04:11.551 --> 04:15.654
But...the hand is quicker
   than the eye.

04:15.722 --> 04:17.623
- Hey, wow!
       - How about that?

04:17.690 --> 04:19.923
Well, obviously,
The Great Raftini is a magician.

04:19.993 --> 04:21.459
Exactly.

04:21.528 --> 04:23.528
Oh, but Ginger, how'd you
       do that trick?

04:23.597 --> 04:25.029
Well, when I first broke
    into showbiz

04:25.098 --> 04:27.499
I worked with a magician.
   He taught me everything.

04:27.568 --> 04:29.100
Did he teach how to get
   a rabbit off somebody's head?

04:29.169 --> 04:31.903
Uh-huh, count to a 100 by 3's.

04:31.972 --> 04:34.906
Three, six, nine..

04:34.975 --> 04:36.207
Oh, what a disappointment.

04:36.276 --> 04:38.076
Here we find something we think
 is going to help.

04:38.145 --> 04:40.111
And it's a bunch of tricks.

04:40.180 --> 04:43.348
We find something I think is
gonna help. And it's tricks.

04:43.417 --> 04:47.452
- I just said that, Gilligan.
 - I thought I heard it before.

04:47.521 --> 04:50.756
Wait a minute. You know these
tricks might save our lives.

04:50.824 --> 04:53.058
In case, we are ever attacked
by savages again.

04:53.126 --> 04:54.893
You remember when those head
hunters landed here?

04:54.962 --> 04:56.794
You don't think
    they're gonna come back?

04:56.863 --> 05:00.932
Even if they do. Are we gonna
   put on a show for them?

05:01.000 --> 05:04.135
Skipper's right. What are we
gonna charge? Two bucks a head?

05:04.204 --> 05:07.038
Ninety seven, one hundred.

05:07.107 --> 05:09.341
- It's gone. Skipper, it's gone.
- It is gone!

05:09.409 --> 05:11.676
Never mind about that.
Let me make myself clear.

05:11.744 --> 05:13.778
If each of us can learn
a few tricks--

05:13.847 --> 05:16.147
I get it, Professor.
            Of course.

05:16.215 --> 05:18.516
We'll learn the trick and
      they'll think we are Gods.

05:18.585 --> 05:21.586
Yeah, we'll learn the trick and
they'll think we are Gods.

05:21.654 --> 05:24.322
Gilligan, why must you repeat
   everything that I say?

05:24.391 --> 05:26.524
It's easier than thinking up
things by myself.

05:26.593 --> 05:28.994
Ginger can teach us all
some magic tricks.

05:29.063 --> 05:30.228
If she still
remembers them.

05:30.297 --> 05:32.597
Well, of course, I do.
          Watch this.

05:32.666 --> 05:35.867
Gilligan, say abracadabra
 and pass your hand over this.

05:35.936 --> 05:37.703
Abracadabra.

05:39.673 --> 05:41.706
Oh, wow!

05:41.775 --> 05:42.740
[sniff]

05:42.809 --> 05:43.941
[sneeze]

05:44.010 --> 05:47.112
Boy, Ginger. I gotta take
       my hat off to you.

05:48.382 --> 05:50.681
I know.
                     200 by 3's.

05:50.750 --> 05:54.052
Three, six, nine.. Stuck.

05:54.888 --> 05:56.521
...twelve.

05:56.589 --> 05:59.523
How are they?
    Fine, give me the road.

05:59.592 --> 06:02.127
Ho ho now, I'm on the highway.

06:02.195 --> 06:03.628
Has everybody happy.

06:03.697 --> 06:05.463
Ah, so much for my opening.

06:05.532 --> 06:07.432
- Now, what have we here?
   - A walking stick.

06:07.501 --> 06:09.234
So would appear
to the naked eye.

06:09.302 --> 06:10.668
If you'll pardon
the expression.

06:10.737 --> 06:13.738
But as we say in showbiz.
Ha ha. Wah-la-a. Ha ha ha.

06:13.807 --> 06:17.308
Oh, how lovely.
          Flags of every nation.

06:17.377 --> 06:19.511
Oh, those on the gold standard,
of course.

06:19.580 --> 06:21.513
I think that
you've a trick for me.

06:21.582 --> 06:23.148
- Yes.
      - Unless agitation.

06:23.216 --> 06:25.750
Now, give me a small bill.
      Nothing very large.

06:25.819 --> 06:27.552
I'm afraid I might
              make a mistake.

06:27.621 --> 06:29.854
Yeah, just happened
    to have a 50 dol--. No.

06:29.923 --> 06:32.123
Five dollar bill
   in my small change pocket.

06:32.192 --> 06:35.760
- There you are, my precious.
 - Now. You go sit down, dear.

06:35.829 --> 06:37.762
In the loungers, of course.
  Of course.

06:37.830 --> 06:39.964
Now, what was it Ginger
told me to do?

06:40.033 --> 06:42.934
Oh, yes. I know.
Tear this like that.

06:43.003 --> 06:47.038
And again like that.
      Again like that.

06:48.208 --> 06:52.611
And then, fold it like this.
  Like this.

06:53.747 --> 06:55.847
Ooh, it's a tough bill.
    Ooh..

06:55.916 --> 06:58.516
Like that.
           Like that.

06:58.585 --> 07:01.819
Now, you be good in there
   and stay together.

07:01.888 --> 07:03.588
[gasps]

07:04.824 --> 07:07.793
Oh, that's working.
      It's working.

07:08.762 --> 07:11.596
Oh, I'm marvelous.

07:11.664 --> 07:13.231
I did it.
      Thurston, I did it.

07:13.300 --> 07:15.333
Darling, of course.
Sure, you did.

07:15.401 --> 07:18.703
Yes, you've rearranged Lincoln.
His beard is now on the top.

07:18.771 --> 07:21.272
Oh, how charming.
     I made a Beetle out of him.

07:21.341 --> 07:23.275
Good show, Lovey.
Good show.

07:23.343 --> 07:25.844
- Come in. Come in.
   - Hi, Mr. and Mrs. Howell.

07:25.912 --> 07:28.613
Can't you see we're in the
   middle of dress rehearsal?

07:28.682 --> 07:30.549
- I wanna show you my trick.
  - Of course, you can.

07:30.617 --> 07:33.785
But understand that Lovey and I
go on next to closing.

07:33.854 --> 07:35.320
Can I show
my trick now?

07:35.388 --> 07:38.122
Quickly because Mr. Howell
      and I are about to retire.

07:38.191 --> 07:40.057
Sleep that is. We retired
       financially, years ago.

07:40.126 --> 07:41.759
Careful investments
             and all that.

07:41.828 --> 07:43.728
- I need a volunteer.
     - Oh, volunteer.

07:43.797 --> 07:45.463
Here we have
 an ordinary pair of handcuffs.

07:45.531 --> 07:47.165
I'll take one,
hook it onto Mr. Howell.

07:47.233 --> 07:50.168
- Oh, yes!
 - And one and hook it onto me.

07:51.838 --> 07:53.538
Now, without the aid
of any mechanical device.

07:53.606 --> 07:57.008
I shall release ourselves.
Abracadabra.

07:57.076 --> 07:58.877
Thank you very much.

08:02.482 --> 08:05.217
Mumbo-jumbo. Voodoo-voodoo.
Open Sesame.

08:30.610 --> 08:33.344
- Thought of the magic word yet?
- Not yet.

08:33.412 --> 08:35.847
While you're thinking, I've
to do the morning calisthenics.

08:35.916 --> 08:37.716
- Join me?
     - Do I have a choice?

08:37.784 --> 08:39.985
Yeah, well, alright.

08:45.892 --> 08:47.292
Have you thought yet?

08:47.361 --> 08:48.893
No, I think
it was my poor wrist.

08:48.962 --> 08:50.928
Well, better concentrate.
 We'll spend our lives together

08:50.997 --> 08:52.464
like Tweetle Dee
               and Tweetle Dumb.

08:52.532 --> 08:55.567
I don't have to tell you
     who is Dee and who is Dumb.

08:55.636 --> 08:58.603
Open up, please. Pretty, please.
With sugar on it.

08:58.672 --> 09:01.606
No, it will never work.
Aah, it worked.

09:01.674 --> 09:03.675
See you later, Mr. Howell.

09:05.245 --> 09:06.478
Alright, Gilligan.

09:06.547 --> 09:08.913
Let's try calisthenics
     one more time.

09:08.981 --> 09:11.783
Oh, you're doing marvelous.
  It's coming easy.

09:13.520 --> 09:15.253
Now, you try, Gilligan.

09:19.593 --> 09:23.160
Ah! Perfect. Gilligan,
 you're a great prestidigitator.

09:23.229 --> 09:25.897
I know I'd be a great magician.
Can't wait to try it on Skipper.

09:28.101 --> 09:30.334
I don't know, Professor.
Still looks like a crate to me.

09:30.403 --> 09:33.504
Oh, no. Once we drape the front.
It'll be disappearing cabinet.

09:33.573 --> 09:34.973
Even if other tricks fail

09:35.041 --> 09:37.175
this will be enough
      to frighten those savages.

09:37.243 --> 09:39.877
Suppose so. I hope Ginger still
knows how to do that trick.

09:39.946 --> 09:41.846
Well, we'll know
                soon enough.

09:41.914 --> 09:43.848
Give me a hand, Skipper.
        We'll spread this drape.

09:43.917 --> 09:45.550
Skipper. Let me show
my new trick.

09:45.619 --> 09:47.051
Not now, Gilligan.

09:47.120 --> 09:49.854
It'll only take a second.
Watch this. See the egg? Watch.

09:55.662 --> 09:57.128
(Skipper)
 'Hey, that's good, Gilligan.'

09:57.196 --> 09:59.363
Yes, Skipper. Let's try it
on you. Take the egg.

09:59.432 --> 10:01.866
Place it inside the ear.
Shove. Now come on, Skipper.

10:01.935 --> 10:04.635
Let me have the egg.
Come on, open your mouth.

10:04.704 --> 10:08.639
Gilligan, it's coming
           out here.

10:08.708 --> 10:11.576
Oh, I'm sorry.
It-it worked for me.

10:11.645 --> 10:13.177
I shoved it in
and it came out my mouth.

10:13.246 --> 10:15.780
That one's is easy for you.
     There's nothing in between.

10:15.849 --> 10:17.148
(Mary Ann)
       'Come and get it.'

10:17.217 --> 10:19.283
- Breakfast time. Come on.
   - You go ahead.

10:19.352 --> 10:20.785
I've already had my egg.

10:22.789 --> 10:23.955
- Good morning.
        - Good morning.

10:24.024 --> 10:26.524
Oh ho. I'm simply famished.

10:26.593 --> 10:29.260
I'm so hungry, I could eat
domestic caviar.

10:29.329 --> 10:31.896
Yes. Oh, dear.
             Forgive me, please.

10:31.964 --> 10:33.898
I knew Thurston couldn't
do this trick.

10:33.966 --> 10:36.100
Ginger, how do you get these
cheap bracelets off?

10:36.169 --> 10:38.803
Oh, it works electronically,
Mrs. Howell.

10:38.871 --> 10:41.172
You see, you say anything you
want into the handcuffs

10:41.241 --> 10:43.675
'and it breaks the beam
    and snaps them open.'

10:43.744 --> 10:45.843
Oh, it snaps at me.
             Yes, let me try.

10:45.912 --> 10:48.413
National Consolidated ACME.

10:48.482 --> 10:50.247
I have it, dear.

10:50.316 --> 10:51.916
A-T-&-T.

10:51.985 --> 10:54.686
Ah-h, blue-chip, every time.

10:54.754 --> 10:57.088
- Good morning.
        - Good morning.

10:57.157 --> 10:58.856
Hold it. Don't anybody move.

10:58.925 --> 11:01.425
The last time I heard that
   somebody stole my money.

11:01.494 --> 11:02.927
What now, Gilligan?

11:02.996 --> 11:05.162
I'm gonna do a trick
 that even Ginger doesn't know.

11:05.231 --> 11:07.565
I'm gonna pull the cloth off the
table without moving anything.

11:07.634 --> 11:09.801
Ready?
             Whoa..

11:20.647 --> 11:23.180
- Oh! I'm sorry.
    - Never mind, Gilligan.

11:23.249 --> 11:25.582
What's wrong with scrambled eggs
or scrambled coconuts or scram--

11:25.651 --> 11:28.786
Gilligan, take all those tricks
and put them in the storage hut.

11:28.855 --> 11:30.088
But I haven't finished
my breakfast yet.

11:30.157 --> 11:32.957
You finished breakfast
          for everybody.

11:33.025 --> 11:35.727
Now, I want you to do
           as I say and get--

11:35.795 --> 11:38.029
(all)
       Get out. Get out.

11:45.972 --> 11:49.707
First, it's Bravo, Bravo, Bravo.
Then it's Boo, Boo, Boo.

11:49.776 --> 11:52.977
What do you expect with audience
that is fickle, fickle, fickle.

11:57.583 --> 12:00.384
'Too bad about breakfast.'

12:00.453 --> 12:03.388
Oh, well. We can eat a bigger
 lunch. Thanks to Gilligan.

12:03.457 --> 12:05.689
In the mean time,
I suggest watching Ginger

12:05.758 --> 12:07.191
run through the disappearing
cabinet trick.

12:07.260 --> 12:09.861
- And make sure it really works.
- Oh, that's a good idea.

12:09.930 --> 12:11.462
I got a better suggestion,
   Professor.

12:11.531 --> 12:14.599
I suggest, we put Gilligan in
 and turn it on full blast.

12:14.668 --> 12:16.734
That boy did ruin my breakfast.

12:16.802 --> 12:18.269
Cost $95.

12:18.338 --> 12:20.705
That shirt cost $95?

12:20.774 --> 12:22.640
Just to clean it.

12:22.709 --> 12:24.308
Gilligan's really impossible.

12:24.377 --> 12:25.476
Certainly is annoying.

12:25.545 --> 12:29.180
Well, to use the precise
scientific term <i> Pest.</i>

12:29.249 --> 12:32.383
Oh, I guess Gilligan,
 does cause nothing but trouble.

12:32.452 --> 12:33.918
Even Mary Ann.

12:37.690 --> 12:41.392
And now, ladies and gentlemen.
 For the <i> Piece de resistance.</i>

12:41.460 --> 12:44.996
Before your very eyes, you will
see a human being disappear.

12:45.065 --> 12:47.064
However, I'll need a volunteer
 from the audience.

12:47.133 --> 12:48.866
Oh, I volunteer.
       I'm a human being.

12:48.935 --> 12:52.269
Good, Gilligan.
        Get in.

12:52.338 --> 12:54.739
Okay, Gilligan.
     Now, when I say vanish

12:54.808 --> 12:56.240
You go through that little
   trapdoor.

12:56.309 --> 12:59.944
And when I say reappear,
   you come back again, okay.

13:00.013 --> 13:02.380
- Goodbye, Ginger.
       - Okay.

13:03.884 --> 13:05.983
And now, ladies
   and gentlemen, I'm ready.

13:06.052 --> 13:08.386
I will take the magic wand,
     and circle it

13:08.454 --> 13:11.789
once, twice, thrice.

13:11.857 --> 13:14.793
And now,
          I order you to vanish.

13:17.797 --> 13:19.196
[applause]

13:19.265 --> 13:21.900
- The fellow had disappeared.
 - It's wonderful.

13:23.136 --> 13:25.436
And now, I will make
      Gilligan reappear.

13:25.505 --> 13:27.604
Oh, Ginger, couldn't you wait
   until after lunch.

13:27.673 --> 13:29.140
[laughs]

13:29.208 --> 13:32.577
Please, Skipper. You're
  disturbing my concentration.

13:32.645 --> 13:35.947
And now,
    I order you to reappear.

13:38.117 --> 13:40.051
He's not there.

13:42.154 --> 13:45.490
Gilligan, the trick's over.
You can come out now. Gilligan.

13:46.692 --> 13:49.060
Gilligan. Gilligan.

13:49.696 --> 13:52.597
It's amazing.

13:52.665 --> 13:54.098
- Where'd he go?
        - Where are you?

13:54.166 --> 13:56.467
Ginger, it's a trick.
     How did you do it?

13:56.536 --> 13:59.070
Well, he's gone.

14:04.911 --> 14:07.578
- It's all my fault.
    - Oh, nonsense, Ginger.

14:07.647 --> 14:09.580
There must be a perfectly
logical explanation

14:09.649 --> 14:11.048
for Gilligan's disappearance.

14:11.117 --> 14:13.384
You don't suppose,
the savages got my little buddy.

14:13.453 --> 14:15.419
Oh, I doubt it.
We would've heard their drums.

14:15.488 --> 14:17.488
At least, he said
       goodbye to me.

14:17.556 --> 14:19.723
Well, why would he want
         to say goodbye?

14:19.792 --> 14:21.292
I don't know.

14:21.361 --> 14:24.028
Wait a minute.
That's it. Don't you see.

14:24.097 --> 14:26.463
Gilligan's missing,
because he wants to be missing.

14:26.532 --> 14:29.032
But why would he leave his
   friends, his pals, his buddy?

14:29.101 --> 14:30.468
Yeah, why should he?

14:30.536 --> 14:31.902
Come to think of it.

14:31.971 --> 14:35.206
I guess I have been on his back
 lately. Do you suppose?

14:35.275 --> 14:37.574
I think we can all
plead guilty to that.

14:37.643 --> 14:40.511
I said he was annoying.

14:40.579 --> 14:41.879
I called him a pest.

14:41.948 --> 14:44.281
I guess that's it.
       He overheard us.

14:44.350 --> 14:46.784
He overheard everything.
    No wonder he left us.

14:46.853 --> 14:49.753
Oh, I can't bare to think
   of my buddy out there

14:49.822 --> 14:51.155
with no food, no water.

14:51.224 --> 14:53.590
Take it easy, Skipper.
We'll form a searching party.

14:53.659 --> 14:56.260
- We'll find him.
   - Yes, of course. We will.

14:56.329 --> 14:58.963
And when we find him,
           I'll pick him up

14:59.032 --> 15:01.832
and...I'll break
          every bone in his body

15:01.901 --> 15:03.968
for worrying us like this.

15:05.438 --> 15:07.805
Gilligan little buddy,
     where are you?

15:07.874 --> 15:09.340
[birds chirping]

15:09.408 --> 15:11.442
Gilligan..

15:19.652 --> 15:21.619
Alright, Gilligan.
    I know you're in there.

15:21.688 --> 15:25.556
Come on out.
Only you could spell like that.

15:25.624 --> 15:29.093
Come on, Gilligan, please.
   I wanna talk to you.

15:29.162 --> 15:31.963
You gotta listen to me.
    I'm sorry.

15:32.031 --> 15:34.231
I said lot of things
      that I didn't mean.

15:34.300 --> 15:36.233
I got a little upset
      that's all.

15:36.302 --> 15:38.602
But I didn't mean a word of it.

15:38.671 --> 15:42.539
Gilligan, can't you understand
I'm trying to apologize to you?

15:42.608 --> 15:46.510
Gilligan, I'm not going back
  until you forgive me.

15:46.579 --> 15:49.546
Gilligan, alright. If you won't
out, I'm coming in after you.

15:49.615 --> 15:51.282
- I'll stay here.
       - Yeah, please.

15:51.350 --> 15:53.584
And don't move 'cause
         I'm going in after you.

15:53.653 --> 15:56.854
- Alright.
        - Oop. Gilligan.

15:56.923 --> 15:58.388
Hi, Skipper,
Do you like my new home?

15:58.457 --> 16:00.858
There's only one room
with a few pictures.

16:00.927 --> 16:02.226
- I--
      - This is nonsense.

16:02.294 --> 16:03.661
You're coming back
              to the hut.

16:03.729 --> 16:06.897
No. I'm not going back to hear
those mean things again.

16:06.966 --> 16:08.699
I'm even a person.
I got feelings.

16:08.767 --> 16:10.835
- Even if I'm only Gilligan.
  - Can't you understand?

16:10.903 --> 16:12.904
We are all sorry.
            We wanna make it up.

16:12.972 --> 16:14.572
This is my home
away from home.

16:14.640 --> 16:16.473
- I'm going back.
       - Gilligan.

16:16.542 --> 16:21.012
- From now on, I'm a lone wolf.
- Gilligan. Wait, boy. Gilligan.

16:21.080 --> 16:22.981
[howling]

16:24.550 --> 16:27.551
Gilligan, my boy.
       Where are you?

16:27.620 --> 16:30.821
This is cash! This is currency.
This is coins.

16:30.890 --> 16:33.391
Honey, stop waving these bills
around. He cannot see them.

16:33.459 --> 16:35.392
Well, you'll have
          to see money, darling.

16:35.461 --> 16:37.595
The odor alone can
             carry 2 or 3 miles.

16:37.664 --> 16:41.866
On a clear day when
           the wind is with you.

16:41.935 --> 16:45.336
Oh, somebody terribly illiterate
must live in that cave.

16:45.405 --> 16:48.172
My dear, we have found
          Gilligan.

16:48.241 --> 16:49.974
Gilligan, my boy,
               are you in there?

16:50.043 --> 16:51.542
(Gilligan)
           'Go away.'

16:51.610 --> 16:53.644
But it's your friends,
my dear boy. The Howells'.

16:53.713 --> 16:56.414
- Tell him what we come to say.
- Yes. I will.

16:56.483 --> 16:59.783
G-Gilligan. We've come here
     to tell you..

16:59.852 --> 17:02.053
- Must I?
        - Yes, you must.

17:02.121 --> 17:03.387
Well, alright, Lovey.

17:03.456 --> 17:05.222
Gilligan, we came here
          to apologize!

17:05.290 --> 17:07.590
Ah, now that didn't
hurt too much, did it?

17:07.660 --> 17:10.727
No, you say it real fast,
       it kills the pain.

17:10.796 --> 17:12.829
(Gilligan)
    'I'm not going back.
    I'm staying right here.'

17:12.897 --> 17:16.099
We must do something for that
poor boy. It's a silly cave.

17:16.167 --> 17:19.637
But what do you want me to do?
 Arrange cave to cave carpeting?

17:19.705 --> 17:21.704
Oh, that's an idea. That's just
what he needs carpeting.

17:21.773 --> 17:24.107
Gimme those bills
you were waving around.

17:24.175 --> 17:25.576
Yeah, I know, but..

17:25.644 --> 17:28.377
There you are, Gilligan.
You spread those around.

17:28.446 --> 17:29.914
And you'll have
a marvelous carpet.

17:29.983 --> 17:32.517
But this money's undeclared.
    I don't pay income on that.

17:34.287 --> 17:36.220
- Oh, Lovey. Yeah.
       - Oh, God.

17:37.923 --> 17:40.991
Professor, Ginger. Come quick.
 I've found Gilligan.

17:41.060 --> 17:43.594
He's in the cave. Look.

17:43.663 --> 17:46.130
Gilligan.
We know you're in there.

17:46.199 --> 17:48.799
Oh, Gilligan,
                please come out.

17:48.868 --> 17:51.335
Okay, okay. I know
   you came here to apologize

17:51.404 --> 17:53.737
for the mean things, money won't
help. Even if I need a carpet.

17:53.806 --> 17:56.941
I'm not going back. Because this
is my home, and I'm a lone wolf.

17:57.009 --> 17:59.544
[howling]

18:01.915 --> 18:03.581
[dramatic music]

18:11.190 --> 18:14.492
Gilligan.
        Come and get it.

18:27.907 --> 18:31.409
Here is some goodies
     to make you bit more comfy.

18:36.049 --> 18:37.548
[music continues]

18:49.995 --> 18:53.831
Gilligan? A little something
  from your friends.

19:27.166 --> 19:29.600
Man! Aren't we a bunch of
old meanies?

19:29.669 --> 19:31.869
Gave Gilligan our blankets
and our food.

19:31.938 --> 19:35.439
I made a supreme sacrifice. I
  gave him my priced possession.

19:35.508 --> 19:38.475
Ah, Thurston.
        Your teddy bear.

19:38.544 --> 19:40.777
Now, I gotta take
my hat off to you.

19:40.846 --> 19:43.113
Beneath that rough exterior,
  there lies a heart of gold.

19:43.182 --> 19:47.752
If that was true. I would've had
it removed and minted years ago.

19:47.820 --> 19:50.521
We are all agreed on one thing.
We want Gilligan back.

19:50.590 --> 19:51.989
- Yes.
   - Oh, I agree, Professor.

19:52.058 --> 19:54.791
But how do we convince Gilligan
we really want him back?

19:54.860 --> 19:56.594
In Hollywood, if you wanna
   convince somebody.

19:56.663 --> 19:58.930
- We throw a party.
    - Ginger, that's right.

19:58.998 --> 20:00.764
We'll throw a party
      for my little buddy.

20:00.833 --> 20:04.134
I just adore parties.
Whom should we invite?

20:04.203 --> 20:06.403
But there's only seven of us
    on the island.

20:06.472 --> 20:07.939
Oh, yes, of course.
That's right.

20:08.007 --> 20:10.607
We'll ask everybody.
It will still be exclusive.

20:10.676 --> 20:13.411
How do we get Gilligan
to attend his own party?

20:13.479 --> 20:14.711
That's right.
        He won't leave the cave.

20:14.780 --> 20:17.781
Oh, what he sees
in that cave is beyond me.

20:17.850 --> 20:21.918
- It's absolutely frightening.
 - That's it, Mrs. Howell.

20:21.987 --> 20:25.222
We'll make it more frightening.
We'll scare him out of the cave.

20:25.290 --> 20:26.523
Scare him, how?

20:26.592 --> 20:28.025
We'll use those master masks

20:28.093 --> 20:30.528
that I found on
 the bottom of magicians crate.

20:30.596 --> 20:32.630
Gilligan will come out
of there so fast

20:32.699 --> 20:36.266
we'll have to catch up to him.
 Now, you girls can get that

20:36.335 --> 20:38.201
"Welcome back Gilligan"
    cake ready.

20:38.270 --> 20:40.338
And gentlemen,
as far as work concern

20:40.406 --> 20:42.873
you two monsters,
come with me.

20:48.714 --> 20:51.048
- All know what to do?
     - You give the signal.

20:51.116 --> 20:52.416
We all go.

20:53.553 --> 20:55.819
- Got that?
          - Yeah.

20:55.888 --> 20:57.421
Alright, come on.

21:05.898 --> 21:07.231
Now.

21:07.300 --> 21:09.433
[people screaming]

21:10.169 --> 21:11.401
Once more.

21:11.470 --> 21:13.037
[people screaming]

21:16.174 --> 21:17.842
[screaming continues]

21:20.646 --> 21:22.913
Look, look, look.
    I told you guys before.

21:22.982 --> 21:25.883
This is my home away from home.
And I'm a lone wolf.

21:25.951 --> 21:27.785
[howling]

21:30.356 --> 21:32.289
Monsters! Monsters!
      Run for your lives!

21:32.357 --> 21:34.425
Run for you.
          Run for you.

21:36.695 --> 21:38.662
What kind of cake
        you're making, Mary Ann?

21:38.731 --> 21:41.498
On this island.
  Hand me the coconut powder.

21:41.567 --> 21:42.933
(Gilligan)
     'Monsters! Monsters!'

21:43.002 --> 21:45.770
Monsters. Monsters.

21:45.838 --> 21:48.406
I mean, don't worry, ladies.
  I'll save you all.

21:50.409 --> 21:51.809
- I think it's working.
    - Good.

21:51.878 --> 21:53.544
Flash powder.
     I'll get the Monsters.

21:53.613 --> 21:55.012
Flash powder here.

21:56.448 --> 21:58.082
[sneezes]

22:09.928 --> 22:11.662
Don't worry, I'll take care
  of those monsters.

22:11.731 --> 22:13.230
- Gilligan, I've to--
     - I can't.

22:13.299 --> 22:15.465
Only seconds behind,
     they'll be here in seconds.

22:15.534 --> 22:17.201
- But Gilligan..
        - Oops. Oops.

22:17.270 --> 22:19.736
Forgot something.

22:19.805 --> 22:22.073
Now listen, now don't panic
  and don't worry.

22:24.710 --> 22:27.411
Come on, girls.
     Let's finish the cake.

22:38.791 --> 22:41.692
Alright, you monsters.
     Now get..

22:41.760 --> 22:44.228
Take one more step
     and I'll kill myself.

22:44.297 --> 22:46.130
Gilligan, it's us.

22:47.767 --> 22:48.899
Ahhhh.

22:53.973 --> 22:56.740
Oh, I get it.
You're trying to trick me, huh?

22:56.808 --> 22:58.876
Putting those masks.
   Drive me out of the cave.

22:58.945 --> 23:02.379
And drive me back.
Well, you're not gonna fool me.

23:02.448 --> 23:05.582
Can't you understand. We're
  trying to give you a party.

23:05.651 --> 23:07.951
'The girls baked you a cake
  and everything.'

23:08.020 --> 23:09.987
Gilligan, I'm afraid
we've all been quite uncouth.

23:10.055 --> 23:13.256
We all are make it up
 by acting a bit more couther.

23:13.325 --> 23:14.992
Webster will forgive me.

23:15.061 --> 23:17.260
(Skipper)
      'Don't you have just
      a little space'

23:17.329 --> 23:18.795
'in your heart to forgive us?'

23:18.864 --> 23:21.398
Oh, I already forgave you, guys.
Only thing bothering me is

23:21.467 --> 23:25.869
I don't see after three dinners,
how do you have room for cake.

23:25.938 --> 23:28.304
Well, one of customers
     I'm to public speaking

23:28.373 --> 23:29.840
I'll make this very brief.

23:29.908 --> 23:32.008
You think, my buddy Skipper
  be such a wonderful guy.

23:32.077 --> 23:34.078
I wanna thank Professor
    being a wonderful guy.

23:34.147 --> 23:36.046
Mr. Howell for being
      a wonderful guy.

23:36.115 --> 23:38.448
And Mrs. Howell for being
   a such a wonderful guy.

23:38.517 --> 23:40.517
You girls for making me
    a wonderful guy.

23:40.586 --> 23:42.386
For baking me such
a wonderful pie.

23:42.455 --> 23:44.054
And making me a wonderful cake.

23:44.123 --> 23:45.855
- I mean baking--
 - Gilligan, that's enough now.

23:45.924 --> 23:48.525
Blow out the candles. So we
  could have a piece of cake.

23:48.594 --> 23:51.262
Just one more thing, Skipper.
 In conclusion, I'd like to say

23:51.330 --> 23:54.632
'I will never leave you all
  ever, ever again.'

23:58.704 --> 24:01.305
- Is everybody alright?
    - Yeah.

24:01.374 --> 24:03.207
Where is Gilligan?

24:03.276 --> 24:04.641
(Gilligan)
           'Up here.'

24:04.710 --> 24:08.412
- Are you alright?
    - I'm fine. Great party.

24:08.480 --> 24:10.714
(Howell)
    'Boy, what a blow out.'

24:18.657 --> 24:19.957
Good morning, Skipper.
          Missed your breakfast.

24:20.026 --> 24:22.393
Thank you, Gilligan.
     I decided to patch up

24:22.462 --> 24:24.061
the hole you made on
      the roof first.

24:24.130 --> 24:25.862
I'm learning a new magic trick.
Want to see?

24:25.931 --> 24:28.832
No, Gilligan. You're not gonna
 pull this tablecloth out.

24:28.901 --> 24:30.301
This is one meal
        I'm gonna eat.

24:30.369 --> 24:31.601
I'm not gonna
    pull the tablecloth out.

24:31.670 --> 24:35.005
I can make the table rise.

24:35.074 --> 24:37.808
- Sure. You can.
     - Yeah, I can. Watch.

24:37.876 --> 24:40.845
I command you to rise.

24:44.083 --> 24:46.683
- I did it.
- Gilligan, this is impossible.

24:46.752 --> 24:49.820
- It is?
            - Yes!

24:51.390 --> 24:53.157
You never should've said that.

25:05.337 --> 25:06.870
¶ Now this is the tale
     of the castaways ¶

25:06.939 --> 25:08.772
¶ They're here for a long,
   long time ¶

25:08.841 --> 25:11.241
¶ They'll have to make
     the best of things ¶

25:11.310 --> 25:13.276
¶ It's an uphill climb ¶

25:13.345 --> 25:15.412
¶ The first mate
     and his skipper too ¶

25:15.481 --> 25:17.548
¶ Will do their very best ¶

25:17.616 --> 25:19.549
¶ To make the others
      comfortable ¶

25:19.618 --> 25:21.718
¶ In their tropic island nest ¶

25:21.787 --> 25:23.887
¶ No phones, no lights,
    no motor cars ¶

25:23.956 --> 25:26.156
¶ Not a single luxury ¶

25:26.225 --> 25:28.425
¶ Like Robinson Crusoe ¶

25:28.494 --> 25:30.394
¶ It's primitive as can be ¶

25:30.462 --> 25:32.662
¶ So join us here
     each week my friends ¶

25:32.731 --> 25:34.931
¶ You're sure to get a smile ¶

25:35.000 --> 25:37.301
¶ From seven stranded
     castaways ¶

25:37.370 --> 25:39.036
¶ Here on Gilligan's Isle ¶

25:40.305 --> 25:46.300
