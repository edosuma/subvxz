- WE REALLY WANT YOU
TO COME.

11:43.375 --> 11:44.959
- LOOK SAD, RETARD.

11:44.959 --> 11:46.208
- ALL RIGHT,
ALL RIGHT.

11:46.208 --> 11:48.333
JUST...
TAKE TWO.

11:48.333 --> 11:51.208
- WILL YOU PLEASE COME OVER?

11:51.208 --> 11:54.625
- FUCK ME.

11:54.625 --> 11:57.000
[sighs]

12:06.667 --> 12:07.709
YOU'RE HERE LATE.

12:07.709 --> 12:10.291
- AH, DIDN'T EVEN NOTICE.

12:10.291 --> 12:12.542
- BIG PLANS TOMORROW?

12:12.542 --> 12:14.375
- [chuckles]
YOU'RE LOOKING AT THEM.

12:14.375 --> 12:15.875
WHATEVER ABOUT TOMORROW,
RIGHT?

12:15.875 --> 12:18.542
IT'S JUST ANOTHER DAY
WHERE PEOPLE EAT TURKEY.

12:18.542 --> 12:21.500
I CAN EAT TURKEY
ANY DAY OF THE YEAR.

12:21.500 --> 12:25.625
- DEXTER'S HAVING PEOPLE OVER.

12:25.625 --> 12:27.709
WELL, ME.
HE INVITED ME OVER.

12:27.709 --> 12:29.750
- HAVE A GOOD TIME.

12:32.458 --> 12:36.750
- YOU KNOW...
[sighs]

12:36.750 --> 12:38.000
I COULD USE A WINGMAN.

12:38.000 --> 12:39.333
- YES.

12:39.333 --> 12:40.709
- I CAN'T PROMISE
IT'LL BE ANY FUN.

12:40.709 --> 12:43.041
- WELL, I COULD BE
YOUR THIGH MAN.

12:43.041 --> 12:44.166
[chuckles]

12:44.166 --> 12:46.458
- DON'T PRESS YOUR LUCK.

12:46.458 --> 12:48.583
I'LL LET RITA KNOW.

12:57.250 --> 12:58.417
- [exhales]

12:58.417 --> 12:59.709
WHAT TIME DO YOU WANT
TO EAT TOMORROW?

12:59.709 --> 13:02.875
- OH, BAD NEWS, BABE.
I GOT TO WORK.

13:02.875 --> 13:05.709
- OH.

13:05.709 --> 13:07.583
WELL, WHAT TIME
DO YOU GET OFF?

13:07.583 --> 13:09.375
- UH...

13:09.375 --> 13:12.250
- YOU DO WANT TO SPEND
THE HOLIDAY TOGETHER, DON'T YOU?

13:12.250 --> 13:14.625
- IT'S A HOLIDAY.

13:14.625 --> 13:15.959
- [chuckles]
EXACTLY.

13:15.959 --> 13:20.375
- SPENDING IT TOGETHER MAKES
THINGS ALL...SERIOUS.

13:20.375 --> 13:23.166
- AH, IT'S JUST
A CASUAL THANKSGIVING

13:23.166 --> 13:25.125
WITH YOUR GIRLFRIEND.

13:25.125 --> 13:27.125
- GIRLFRIEND?

13:27.125 --> 13:31.625
THAT SOUNDS REALLY SERIOUS.

13:31.625 --> 13:34.041
- JOEY...

13:34.041 --> 13:36.959
I DON'T WANT
TO SPEND IT ALONE.

13:39.125 --> 13:40.458
[chuckles]

13:40.458 --> 13:42.959
PLUS, UH...

13:42.959 --> 13:46.583
I MAKE THE BEST PECAN PIE
IN THE STATE OF FLORIDA.

13:49.583 --> 13:51.458
- I GUESS I COULD,
YOU KNOW,

13:51.458 --> 13:53.125
COME BY FOR DESSERT.

13:53.125 --> 13:56.000
- OH, SO YOU JUST WANT
TO EAT MY PIE.

13:56.000 --> 13:57.166
IS THAT IT?

13:57.166 --> 13:58.959
- [chuckles]

14:12.625 --> 14:14.917
- HAPPY THANKSGIVING,
MR. MITCHELL.

14:14.917 --> 14:17.125
- HAPPY THANKSGIVING.

14:34.417 --> 14:37.583
- I'LL BE AT ARTHUR'S BY 1:00,
HOME BY 4:00.

14:37.583 --> 14:40.667
A SERIAL KILLER'S THANKSGIVING
RECIPE FOR SUCCESS.

14:40.667 --> 14:42.041
- HOW CAN NONE
OF THESE BE BIG ENOUGH?

14:42.041 --> 14:44.125
- WELL, MAYBE IF WE,
UM...

14:44.125 --> 14:46.166
[imitating Julia Child]
TURN THE BIRD ON ITS SIDE

14:46.166 --> 14:47.208
AND THEN--AND, UM--
[laughter]

14:47.208 --> 14:48.375
HEY, DEX.

14:48.375 --> 14:50.625
- HOWDY, PILGRIM.

14:50.625 --> 14:52.625
- DID YOU HEAR THAT THE PILGRIMS
DIDN'T EAT TURKEY

14:52.625 --> 14:54.375
ON THE FIRST THANKSGIVING?

14:54.375 --> 14:55.750
- REALLY?

14:55.750 --> 14:59.125
- THEY ATE CORN AND EEL,
WHICH THE NATIVE AMERICANS

14:59.125 --> 15:01.041
TAUGHT THEM TO PLANT AND FISH.

15:01.041 --> 15:02.625
- THEN THE PILGRIMS
SLAUGHTERED THEM ALL,

15:02.625 --> 15:04.542
TOOK THEIR FOOD,
AND WENT TO CHURCH THE NEXT DAY

15:04.542 --> 15:09.875
TO THANK GOD
FOR ALL THEIR GOOD LUCK.

15:09.875 --> 15:12.500
- MM, IT'S A PHASE.
DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT.

15:12.500 --> 15:17.041
- WHAT YOU SAID ABOUT TRADITIONS
SHAPING OUR KIDS...

15:17.041 --> 15:19.834
MY NOT GOING TO WORK,
WILL THAT...MISSHAPE THEM?

15:19.834 --> 15:21.125
- [scoffs]
LOOK.

15:21.125 --> 15:23.458
I WISH IT WAS OTHERWISE,
BUT YOU'LL BE HOME SOON, RIGHT?

15:23.458 --> 15:27.917
- RIGHT.
I JUST--

15:27.917 --> 15:29.667
I DON'T WANT
TO DO ANY DAMAGE.

15:29.667 --> 15:32.166
- [chuckles]
YOU'RE A PARENT.

15:32.166 --> 15:33.917
PARENTS DO DAMAGE.

15:33.917 --> 15:35.750
HOPEFULLY WE'LL DO ENOUGH
OF THE GOOD STUFF

15:35.750 --> 15:37.500
TO BALANCE IT OUT.

15:37.500 --> 15:40.417
- HOPEFULLY.

15:40.417 --> 15:43.041
THANKS.

15:44.792 --> 15:46.917
- "ASHES TO ASHES..."

15:46.917 --> 15:49.458
- DOUGHNUT TO DOUGHNUT.

15:49.458 --> 15:50.542
IT'S ALL THE STORE
HAD LEFT.

15:50.542 --> 15:52.583
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

15:52.583 --> 15:53.917
- AVOIDING CHRISTINE.

15:53.917 --> 15:55.458
SHE CAN BE A LITTLE INTENSE.

15:55.458 --> 15:57.417
- TELL ME ABOUT IT.

15:57.417 --> 15:59.750
SHE KEEPS CALLING TO SET
THAT INTERVIEW WITH ME.

15:59.750 --> 16:01.625
- YOU SAID YOU'D DO IT.

16:01.625 --> 16:04.208
- LITTLE BUSY HERE.

16:04.208 --> 16:05.959
LOOK AT THE TIMING
OF THE TRINITY KILLS.

16:05.959 --> 16:09.792
15 IN DECEMBER,
40 IN JULY AND AUGUST,

16:09.792 --> 16:12.458
20 OR SO IN THE SPRING.

16:12.458 --> 16:13.750
WHAT'S THE PATTERN?

16:13.750 --> 16:16.750
- LONG-HAUL TRUCK DRIVER?

16:16.750 --> 16:19.000
MIGRANT WORKER?

16:19.000 --> 16:20.333
SOME KIND OF SALESMAN.

16:20.333 --> 16:22.417
- YEAH.

16:22.417 --> 16:23.542
- GOBBLE, GOBBLE.

16:23.542 --> 16:26.959
- SHE'S NOTHING
IF NOT PERSISTENT.

16:26.959 --> 16:28.458
- HEY, BABE.
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

16:28.458 --> 16:31.375
- I THOUGHT I'D BRING
THANKSGIVING TO YOU.

16:31.375 --> 16:33.709
- HOW SWEET.

16:33.709 --> 16:35.000
- THERE'S ENOUGH
FOR BOTH OF YOU.

16:35.000 --> 16:36.959
- OH, THANKS,
BUT I'M HEADING OUT.

16:36.959 --> 16:39.166
- DEBRA'S TAKING THE DAY OFF.

16:39.166 --> 16:41.000
- FUCK THAT.
I'LL BE MULTITASKING.

16:41.000 --> 16:43.417
- WELL, I GUESS YOU CAN
TAKE THE DAY OFF TOO.

16:43.417 --> 16:47.625
- SURE HE CAN.

16:47.625 --> 16:51.125
- YEAH, LET ME JUST, UH,
CHECK WITH THE BOSS.

16:51.125 --> 16:55.000
WE'LL GO EAT.

16:55.000 --> 16:57.750
- SO, DEBRA,
HOW ARE YOU FEELING?

16:57.750 --> 16:59.667
- DO YOU MIND IF WE PUT OFF
THAT INTERVIEW

16:59.667 --> 17:00.875
UNTIL AFTER THE HOLIDAY?

17:00.875 --> 17:03.500
- I'M NOT HERE AS A REPORTER.

17:03.500 --> 17:06.500
I'M HERE AS JOEY'S GIRLFRIEND.

17:06.500 --> 17:08.834
- MY CONDOLENCES.

17:08.834 --> 17:10.834
- [chuckles]

17:10.834 --> 17:13.667
YOU KNOW, HE REALLY CARES
ABOUT YOU.

17:13.667 --> 17:16.667
AFTER YOU GOT SHOT, YOU WERE
ALL HE COULD TALK ABOUT.

17:16.667 --> 17:18.542
REALLY MESSED HIM UP.

17:18.542 --> 17:20.208
- WELL, THAT MAKES
TWO OF US.

17:20.208 --> 17:22.291
- I JUST--

17:22.291 --> 17:27.208
I JUST WANTED TO SAY,
UM...

17:27.208 --> 17:30.750
I'M REALLY SORRY ABOUT
WHAT HAPPENED TO YOU.

17:32.375 --> 17:36.041
I CAN'T EVEN IMAGINE
LOOKING INTO THE EYES

17:36.041 --> 17:39.208
OF THE PERSON YOU LOVE...

17:39.208 --> 17:41.166
WATCHING AS HE TAKES
HIS LAST BREATH.

17:46.166 --> 17:47.875
- LET'S HOPE YOU NEVER
HAVE TO.

17:47.875 --> 17:50.500
- [exhales]

17:53.792 --> 17:56.208
[muffled conversation]

17:58.709 --> 18:01.166
- YOU GOT LLOYD PAULSON
TO CONFESS?

18:01.166 --> 18:04.500
- BEEN WAITING TEN YEARS
TO CLOSE THIS ONE.

18:04.500 --> 18:06.166
I PROMISED
THE VICTIM'S HUSBAND

18:06.166 --> 18:08.083
I'D FIND THE MAN
WHO KILLED HIS WIFE.

18:08.083 --> 18:09.667
FINALLY LIVED UP
TO THAT PROMISE.

18:09.667 --> 18:11.625
- YOU SHOULD GO
TELL THE HUSBAND.

18:11.625 --> 18:13.208
GIVE HIM SOMETHING
TO BE THANKFUL FOR.

18:13.208 --> 18:14.709
- AS SOON AS I PROCESS
THAT PENDEJO.

18:14.709 --> 18:16.750
DO YOU WANT TO COME WITH?

18:16.750 --> 18:20.125
- TO A NEXT-OF-KIN
NOTIFICATION?

18:20.125 --> 18:22.208
- IT IS OFFICIAL BUSINESS.

18:27.667 --> 18:30.709
[doorbell rings]

18:30.709 --> 18:32.083
- KYLE.

18:32.083 --> 18:34.083
- HAPPY THANKSGIVING.

18:34.083 --> 18:36.291
- TO YOU TOO.

18:36.291 --> 18:37.792
- KYLE.

18:37.792 --> 18:39.250
WHAT A NICE SURPRISE.

18:39.250 --> 18:41.125
- APPARENTLY JONAH DIDN'T
MENTION INVITING ME.

18:41.125 --> 18:45.250
I JUST WANTED
TO DROP BY AND SAY HI.

18:45.250 --> 18:50.333
IT'S MY FIRST THANKSGIVING
WITHOUT MY FAMILY AND I...

18:50.333 --> 18:53.291
DIDN'T KNOW WHAT
TO DO WITH MYSELF.

18:55.250 --> 18:57.917
- I SUPPOSE YOU SHOULD EAT
WITH US.

18:57.917 --> 19:00.250
FULL TABLES,
FULL HEARTS,

19:00.250 --> 19:01.625
FULL BELLIES.

19:01.625 --> 19:04.750
COME ON IN.

19:04.750 --> 19:06.709
[knock on door]

19:06.709 --> 19:08.542
- AUNT DEB'S HERE!

19:08.542 --> 19:11.125
- HAPPY THANKSGIVING,
TURKEYS.

19:11.125 --> 19:14.583
THANKS FOR THE VIDEO.

19:14.583 --> 19:16.542
- HI, DEB.
- HI, DEB.

19:16.542 --> 19:17.959
- HI.

19:17.959 --> 19:19.375
[whispers]
WHO'S THAT?

19:19.375 --> 19:21.542
- DANNY AND GRACE'S DAD.
- DANNY, LET ME HELP.

19:21.542 --> 19:22.542
YOU DON'T KNOW WHERE
THAT PIECE IS.

19:22.542 --> 19:24.458
- AH.

19:24.458 --> 19:25.667
WHERE'S DEXTER?

19:25.667 --> 19:27.542
- [sighs]
HE'S AT SOME CRIME THING

19:27.542 --> 19:28.709
IN MONROE COUNTY.

19:28.709 --> 19:31.125
SAID HE'D BE BACK FOR DINNER.

19:31.125 --> 19:32.500
- HE'S MORE LIKE DAD
EVERY DAY.

19:32.500 --> 19:33.583
- COME LOOK AT OUR PUZZLE.

19:33.583 --> 19:34.917
WE'VE ALREADY GOT THE CORNERS.

19:34.917 --> 19:36.959
- CODY, LEAVE HER ALONE.

19:36.959 --> 19:38.458
- YOU DON'T WANT TO HELP?

19:38.458 --> 19:40.458
- I'M SORRY, LITTLE MAN,
BUT I'VE GOT WORK TO DO.

19:40.458 --> 19:42.291
- OH.

19:44.166 --> 19:45.667
- [chuckles]

19:45.667 --> 19:48.750
- YOU ARE GOOD.

19:48.750 --> 19:51.000
- ANOTHER THREE HOURS TO GO.

19:51.000 --> 19:52.041
- OH, WHEN DO YOU WANT
TO PUT IN

19:52.041 --> 19:53.667
THE BROCCOLI-CHEESE
CASSEROLE?

19:53.667 --> 19:55.333
- UH, ABOUT AN HOUR BEFORE.

19:55.333 --> 19:56.500
THE SWEET POTATOES
NEED AN HOUR

19:56.500 --> 19:57.834
AND THE CORN PUDDING NEEDS
ABOUT 30 MINUTES.

19:57.834 --> 19:59.291
- IS IT ALL GONNA FIT?

19:59.291 --> 20:01.083
- [sighs]

20:01.083 --> 20:02.625
NO.

20:02.625 --> 20:05.125
NONE OF IT'S GONNA FIT.
WHAT WAS I THINKING?

20:05.125 --> 20:06.500
- WELL, YOU WERE
THINKING THAT,

20:06.500 --> 20:09.000
"MY FABULOUS NEIGHBOR HAS,
NOT ONE, BUT TWO OVENS."

20:09.000 --> 20:10.709
- [scoffs]

20:10.709 --> 20:12.208
YOU KNOW, YOU REALLY ARE
A LIFESAVER.

20:12.208 --> 20:14.542
YOU SHOULD JUST WEAR
A RED CROSS ON YOUR FOREHEAD.

20:14.542 --> 20:15.875
- [chuckles]

20:15.875 --> 20:17.792
[laughter]
OVEN CRISIS.

20:17.792 --> 20:18.792
- DEB, CAN YOU
WATCH THE KIDS?

20:18.792 --> 20:20.458
HARRISON'S ASLEEP.

20:20.458 --> 20:22.291
- UH, ACTUALLY, I WAS GONNA
TRY TO GET SOME...

20:22.291 --> 20:23.709
- OH!

20:23.709 --> 20:25.458
- WORK DONE.

20:25.458 --> 20:26.834
- VINCE, HI.

20:26.834 --> 20:28.500
VINCE, ELLIOT.
ELLIOT, VINCE.

20:28.500 --> 20:29.709
- HI.
UH, BYE.

20:29.709 --> 20:31.875
- UH, BYE.

20:31.875 --> 20:34.041
- BYE.

20:34.041 --> 20:35.208
- THEY'RE USING HIS OVEN.

20:35.208 --> 20:38.375
- OH, WELL, GUESS I'LL BE USING
HIS OVEN TOO.

20:38.375 --> 20:41.125
CHOCOLATE LAVA CAKES.
MY SPECIALTY.

20:41.125 --> 20:42.709
- YOU HAVE A SPECIALTY?

20:42.709 --> 20:45.500
- A RIVER OF CHOCOLATE LOVE
THAT MELTS IN YOUR MOUTH.

20:45.500 --> 20:46.542
- WOW.

20:46.542 --> 20:48.458
YOU CAN MAKE ANYTHING
SOUND PERVERTED.

20:48.458 --> 20:50.208
- IT'S A GIFT.

20:57.333 --> 20:59.583
- ARTHUR SEEMS TO BE
IN A DECENT MOOD.

20:59.583 --> 21:01.750
MAYBE I'LL BE ABLE
TO SLIP OUT EARLY.

21:01.750 --> 21:03.041
IT'S ALMOST 1:00.

21:03.041 --> 21:04.458
YOU WANT ME
TO SET THE TABLE?

21:04.458 --> 21:06.083
- NO, WE'VE GOT
TO WATCH THE GAME FIRST.

21:06.083 --> 21:07.750
- THE GAME?
- YEAH.

21:07.750 --> 21:08.917
IT'S TRADITION, KYLE.

21:08.917 --> 21:11.000
- AH.

21:11.000 --> 21:13.875
WILL THE KIDS BE JOINING US?

21:13.875 --> 21:16.417
- THAT TOO WOULD
BE TRADITION,

21:16.417 --> 21:20.083
BUT APPARENTLY JONAH
HAS FORGOTTEN.

21:20.083 --> 21:21.917
- I'M SURE HE'S ON HIS WAY.

21:21.917 --> 21:24.375
HE KNOWS HOW IMPORTANT
HOLIDAYS ARE TO YOU.

21:29.250 --> 21:31.625
- NOT SUCH A DECENT MOOD
AFTER ALL.

21:34.375 --> 21:37.834
- DO YOU THINK REBECCA
COULD COME OUT NOW?

21:37.834 --> 21:39.333
- I SUPPOSE.

21:39.333 --> 21:41.417
I'LL GO GET HER.

21:44.417 --> 21:46.125
- SHE GROUNDED OR SOMETHING?

21:46.125 --> 21:47.792
- OH, NO.

21:47.792 --> 21:50.500
NO, NOTHING LIKE THAT.

22:00.458 --> 22:02.458
- THIS IS CARL HAAS?

22:02.458 --> 22:04.208
- HE'S BEEN IN A PERSISTENT
VEGETATIVE STATE

22:04.208 --> 22:06.375
FOR SEVERAL YEARS.

22:06.375 --> 22:07.959
STEPPED OFF A SIDEWALK,

22:07.959 --> 22:11.542
GOT HIT BY A BUS.

22:11.542 --> 22:14.583
- I DIDN'T KNOW.

22:14.583 --> 22:17.000
IT'S BEEN A LONG TIME.

22:17.000 --> 22:20.709
- WOULD IT BE POSSIBLE TO HAVE
A MOMENT ALONE WITH HIM?

22:20.709 --> 22:22.625
- HAVE A GOOD TURKEY DAY.

22:28.166 --> 22:30.458
- TELL HIM.

22:30.458 --> 22:32.000
- LIKE HE CAN HEAR ME.

22:32.000 --> 22:34.333
- HE'LL HEAR YOU.

22:44.166 --> 22:48.291
- MR. HAAS, I'M THE ONE
WHO TOLD YOU ABOUT YOUR WIFE.

22:50.375 --> 22:53.917
I ALSO PROMISED
THAT I'D FI--

22:53.917 --> 22:57.208
THIS IS POINTLESS.

22:57.208 --> 23:01.542
- MR. HAAS,
ANGEL KNOWS HOW MUCH

23:01.542 --> 23:04.834
YOUR WIFE MEANT TO YOU...

23:04.834 --> 23:06.375
AND HE WANTS YOU TO KNOW...

23:14.375 --> 23:18.083
- I WANT YOU TO KNOW...

23:18.083 --> 23:22.125
THAT WE FOUND
THE GUY WHO KILLED HER.

23:22.125 --> 23:24.291
I WISH--

23:24.291 --> 23:27.583
I WISH WE WOULD HAVE
FOUND HIM SOONER.

23:27.583 --> 23:30.792
REALLY, I WISH HE WOULD HAVE
NEVER KILLED YOUR WIFE,

23:30.792 --> 23:33.333
BUT I CAN'T CHANGE THAT.

23:36.875 --> 23:39.291
CAN'T CHANGE ANYTHING.

23:39.291 --> 23:41.792
BUT WE GOT THE GUY.

23:41.792 --> 23:44.291
WE GOT HIM.

23:47.917 --> 23:50.000
- HELLO, MR. BUTLER.
HOW ARE YOU?

23:50.000 --> 23:51.333
- WELL, I'M FINE, REBECCA.

23:51.333 --> 23:53.500
- KYLE, YOU UP FOR A LITTLE
PRE-GAME FOOTBALL TOSS?

23:53.500 --> 23:55.542
- I SUPPOSE.

23:55.542 --> 23:57.959
- I'LL GO HELP MOM
IN THE KITCHEN.

24:02.417 --> 24:05.333
- AT LEAST I HAVE
ONE PERFECT CHILD.

24:05.333 --> 24:07.583
- YEAH, SO IT
WOULD APPEAR.

24:07.583 --> 24:09.417
- COME ON.

24:13.083 --> 24:16.500
NORMALLY JONAH SUPPLIES
THE FOOTBALL.

24:16.500 --> 24:17.917
- HOW ABOUT BASEBALL?

24:17.917 --> 24:20.291
- NO.
WE THROW THE BASEBALL IN SPRING.

24:20.291 --> 24:21.667
THANKSGIVING
WE THROW THE FOOTBALL.

24:21.667 --> 24:23.834
TRADITIONS MATTER,
KYLE.

24:23.834 --> 24:26.625
- YES, THEY...

24:26.625 --> 24:27.959
SHAPE PEOPLE.

24:27.959 --> 24:29.083
- YEAH,
AND GIVE CHILDREN

24:29.083 --> 24:31.458
A SENSE OF HISTORY,
TRADITION.

24:31.458 --> 24:33.959
TEACHES THEM WHO THEY ARE
AND WHAT'S EXPECTED OF THEM.

24:33.959 --> 24:36.458
- AND WHAT IS EXPECTED OF THEM?

24:36.458 --> 24:39.250
- GENEROSITY,
COMMON SENSE, OBEDIENCE.

24:39.250 --> 24:42.041
IT'S A FATHER'S RESPONSIBILITY
TO SET THE BOUNDARIES.

24:42.041 --> 24:46.291
CHILD'S DUTY TO HONOR THEM.

24:46.291 --> 24:48.125
NO, THERE'S NOTHING
DOWN THERE.

24:48.125 --> 24:50.959
STOP!
KYLE, NO!

24:54.458 --> 24:57.000
I MADE THAT...

24:57.000 --> 24:59.000
WHEN I WAS STILL CONFUSED.

25:02.709 --> 25:04.625
- WELL, IT'S BEAUTIFUL.

25:08.542 --> 25:11.625
- WHICH IS WHY I HAVEN'T
TORN IT APART.

25:11.625 --> 25:14.792
PROBABLY DONATE IT
TO THE NEEDY.

25:14.792 --> 25:17.041
OBVIOUSLY I WON'T
BE NEEDING IT.

25:17.041 --> 25:19.417
- NO, YOU'LL BE BURIED
AT SEA.

25:19.417 --> 25:22.166
- I HAVE A NEW LEASE
ON LIFE.

25:22.166 --> 25:23.500
THANKS TO YOU.

25:23.500 --> 25:25.542
- [chuckles]

25:25.542 --> 25:28.208
HEY.

25:28.208 --> 25:30.750
HUH.
THE BEST LAID PLANS.

25:30.750 --> 25:34.000
- IT'S JONAH'S.

25:34.000 --> 25:36.333
WHAT'S THE POINT OF GIVING HIM
THE BETTER THINGS IN LIFE

25:36.333 --> 25:40.667
IF HE CAN'T TAKE CARE
OF THEM?

25:46.834 --> 25:50.875
- WHAT KIND OF FATHER KEEPS
A COFFIN IN HIS GARAGE?

25:50.875 --> 25:55.709
- WHAT KIND OF FATHER KEEPS
BLOOD SLIDES IN HIS SHED?

25:55.709 --> 25:57.500
- [sighs]

26:01.208 --> 26:02.834
HEY, WE CAN STILL GET SOME--

26:06.709 --> 26:09.458
HERE WE GO.

26:09.458 --> 26:11.250
- DAD, I DON'T KNOW
WHAT HAPPENED.

26:11.250 --> 26:15.000
IT WAS--THE CAR WAS PARKED
IN LUKE'S DRIVEWAY ALL NIGHT.

26:15.000 --> 26:16.834
I CAME OUT THIS MORNING AND,
YOU KNOW,

26:16.834 --> 26:19.667
SOMEONE HAD JUST GONE
ALL MENTAL ON IT.

26:21.041 --> 26:23.250
DAD, I AM SO SORRY.

26:23.250 --> 26:24.583
- [sighs]

26:24.583 --> 26:27.709
THAT'S WHY GOD INVENTED
CAR INSURANCE, RIGHT?

26:39.083 --> 26:40.583
IT'LL BE OKAY.

26:59.083 --> 27:02.834
- THERE.

27:02.834 --> 27:06.458
NOW IT'S DRIVABLE
TILL WE CAN GET HER FIXED.

27:06.458 --> 27:08.917
WELL...

27:08.917 --> 27:10.125
GAME'S ABOUT TO START.

27:10.125 --> 27:12.583
SHALL WE?

27:19.250 --> 27:20.291
- COME ON, DANNY.

27:20.291 --> 27:21.917
THROW IT HERE.

27:21.917 --> 27:23.208
- OH, GOOD ONE.

27:23.208 --> 27:26.000
- HEY, YOU TWO.
NO WIFFLE BALL IN THE HOUSE.

27:26.000 --> 27:27.875
- I DON'T KNOW HOW YOU DO IT.

27:27.875 --> 27:29.792
ALL THESE KIDS
AT HOME AT THE SAME TIME.

27:29.792 --> 27:32.125
- [chuckles]
THANKSVING'S ONLY FOUR DAYS.

27:32.125 --> 27:33.500
YOU SHOULD TRY KEEPING
THEM ENTERTAINED

27:33.500 --> 27:34.792
FOR THREE MONTHS
IN THE SUMMER.

27:34.792 --> 27:37.000
- YEAH, PLUS SPRING BREAK
AND CHRISTMAS BREAK.

27:37.000 --> 27:39.458
- THAT'S WHEN YOU'RE REALLY
CLIMBING THE WALLS.

27:39.458 --> 27:44.083
- JUNE, JULY, AUGUST...

27:44.083 --> 27:46.000
DECEMBER.

27:46.000 --> 27:48.250
OH...

27:48.250 --> 27:50.250
FU-U-UDGE.

27:50.250 --> 27:52.166
TRINITY'S
IN THE SCHOOL SYSTEM.

27:52.166 --> 27:54.166
- PROBABLY A GAIN OF ABOUT--
- QUINN.

27:54.166 --> 27:55.333
- JOEY, IT'S DEB.

27:55.333 --> 27:57.333
HIS KILL SCHEDULE MATCHES
THE SCHOOL YEAR.

27:57.333 --> 27:58.709
TRINITY COULD BE A JANITOR.

27:58.709 --> 28:01.083
HE COULD BE A CAFETERIA WORKER,
A BUS DRIVER,

28:01.083 --> 28:02.500
A TEACHER OR PRINCIPAL.

28:02.500 --> 28:04.166
WE GOT TO GET
TO THE STATION.

28:04.166 --> 28:05.583
- I HAVEN'T EATEN YET.

28:05.583 --> 28:07.583
- JESUS, GRAB A DRUMSTICK
TO GO.

28:07.583 --> 28:09.417
- DEB, NO ONE'S
WORKING TODAY

28:09.417 --> 28:10.667
AND WE'RE GONNA
NEED A WARRANT

28:10.667 --> 28:12.208
TO ACCESS
ANY SCHOOL DATABASES.

28:12.208 --> 28:13.667
- WE CAN FIND A JUDGE.

28:13.667 --> 28:15.375
- YEAH, WHO'S GONNA LOVE US
FOR TEARING HIM

28:15.375 --> 28:16.333
AWAY FROM HIS FAMILY.

28:16.333 --> 28:17.500
COME ON.

28:17.500 --> 28:19.875
WE'RE NOT GONNA GET
ANYWHERE TODAY.

28:19.875 --> 28:21.959
- [sighs]
FU--

28:21.959 --> 28:23.667
FUDGE.

28:23.667 --> 28:24.959
[cell phone beeps]

28:24.959 --> 28:26.875
- BREAK IN A CASE?

28:26.875 --> 28:28.542
- WE'LL SEE.

28:28.542 --> 28:32.709
- [sighs]

28:32.709 --> 28:35.709
NOT A HORRIBLE THANKSGIVING,
RIGHT?

28:35.709 --> 28:38.542
- NO, ACTUALLY,
IT'S KIND OF NICE.

28:38.542 --> 28:40.333
- YOU SOUND SURPRISED.

28:40.333 --> 28:42.458
- I AM A LITTLE.

28:42.458 --> 28:43.959
- HMM.

28:43.959 --> 28:47.333
SO HAVING A GIRLFRIEND ISN'T
SO BAD AFTER ALL?

28:47.333 --> 28:48.917
- YOU WITH THE LABELS.

28:48.917 --> 28:50.375
- [sighs]

28:50.375 --> 28:52.208
- WHY DOES IT MATTER?

28:52.208 --> 28:55.542
- I JUST--

28:55.542 --> 28:57.625
I CARE ABOUT YOU.

28:57.625 --> 29:00.000
I'D KIND OF LIKE
TO HAVE IT RETURNED.

29:03.041 --> 29:04.834
- COME HERE.

29:09.542 --> 29:13.875
- [whispers]
I HAVE A BETTER IDEA.

29:13.875 --> 29:15.417
- AWW.

29:15.417 --> 29:17.917
YOU ARE SO MY GIRLFRIEND.

29:17.917 --> 29:19.959
- [laughs]

29:23.458 --> 29:25.083
- GET--GET--

29:25.083 --> 29:26.417
GET HIM!
GET HIM!

29:26.417 --> 29:27.709
GET--GET--GET--
GET HIM!

29:27.709 --> 29:29.250
AH!

29:29.250 --> 29:30.500
- OH, IT'S OKAY.

29:30.500 --> 29:32.041
THEY DIDN'T GET
THE FIRST DOWN.

29:32.041 --> 29:33.250
- [sighs]

29:33.250 --> 29:35.166
- JONAH SEEMS SAFE
FOR THE MOMENT.

29:35.166 --> 29:37.000
I'M NOT A BIG FOOTBALL FAN.

29:37.000 --> 29:39.583
I THINK I'LL GO SEE
IF I CAN HELP SALLY.

29:39.583 --> 29:43.291
- OH, THAT'S VERY
NICE OF YOU.

29:45.417 --> 29:48.917
- LO AT THAT.
THERE'S THREE MEN ON HIM.

29:48.917 --> 29:51.250
- YEAH, I KNOW.

29:53.375 --> 29:56.959
- THIS ROOM'S KIND OF YOUNG
FOR A TEENAGER.

30:01.834 --> 30:04.291
ARE THOSE TO KEEP
SOMEONE OUT

30:04.291 --> 30:07.417
OR KEEP SOMEONE IN?

30:16.709 --> 30:20.083
MY GOD.
HE LOCKS HIS DAUGHTER IN HERE.

30:22.333 --> 30:24.166
[door closes]

30:30.959 --> 30:33.583
YOU NEED ANY HELP?

30:33.583 --> 30:36.500
I'M COMPLETELY USELESS
IN THE KITCHEN.

30:36.500 --> 30:38.166
- SURE.

30:38.166 --> 30:41.125
UH, SOMETHING
FOR THE CENTERPIECE.

30:41.125 --> 30:42.875
ROSES.

30:42.875 --> 30:43.917
DAD ALWAYS LIKES THESE.

30:43.917 --> 30:45.959
- EVERYTHING FOR DAD, HUH?

30:45.959 --> 30:48.208
- [scoffs]

30:48.208 --> 30:51.333
THOSE LOCKS ON YOUR DOOR
FOR HIM TOO?

30:57.500 --> 31:00.333
- HE SAYS THEY'RE THERE
TO PROTECT ME.

31:00.333 --> 31:01.959
- DO THEY?

31:06.625 --> 31:07.750
- THIRD DOWN.

31:07.750 --> 31:09.208
- HE'S OPEN.
HE'S OPEN!

31:09.208 --> 31:10.583
GO, GO!

31:10.583 --> 31:12.333
TOUCHDOWN!
- OH!

31:12.333 --> 31:14.458
- WHAT A PLAY.

31:21.417 --> 31:26.875
- NO.
NO, DAD.

31:26.875 --> 31:31.959
OW!
[muffled scream]

31:31.959 --> 31:34.000
[grunts]

31:36.834 --> 31:39.208
- AND THAT'S
FOR MY WINDSHIELD.

31:42.667 --> 31:45.583
THINGS OF BEAUTY NEED
TO BE HONORED.

31:57.834 --> 31:59.750
- I RAN AWAY ONCE.

31:59.750 --> 32:02.917
HE CAUGHT ME AND...

32:02.917 --> 32:04.000
IT WAS BAD.

32:04.000 --> 32:06.542
- IT'S NOT ALWAYS
GONNA BE LIKE THIS.

32:06.542 --> 32:10.625
- [scoffs]

32:10.625 --> 32:13.959
JONAH TOLD ME
THAT YOU'RE HELPING HIM.

32:13.959 --> 32:15.709
- YEAH, IF YOU CAN CALL
IT THAT.

32:15.709 --> 32:18.291
- YOU CAN HELP ME TOO.

32:18.291 --> 32:20.917
GET ME OUT OF HERE.

32:20.917 --> 32:23.250
- YOU JUST NEED
TO WAIT A WHILE.

32:23.250 --> 32:27.917
YOU'RE TOO YOUNG
TO BE ON YOUR OWN.

32:27.917 --> 32:31.417
- I DON'T HAVE
TO BE ON MY OWN.

32:31.417 --> 32:33.583
I COULD BE WITH YOU.

32:33.583 --> 32:35.083
- WITH  ME?

32:35.083 --> 32:39.750
- JONAH ALSO SAYS YOU'RE NICE.

32:39.750 --> 32:41.625
- I TRY TO BE.

32:41.625 --> 32:43.959
- IF YOU'RE NICE TO ME,

32:43.959 --> 32:47.125
I CAN BE NICE TO YOU.

32:47.125 --> 32:49.625
I'LL DO ANYTHING YOU WANT.

32:49.625 --> 32:51.667
- WHOA.
I DON'T--

32:51.667 --> 32:54.959
REBECCA, YOU'RE 15.

32:54.959 --> 32:57.458
I DON'T WANT ANYTHING
FROM YOU.

32:57.458 --> 32:59.750
- I DON'T BELIEVE YOU.

32:59.750 --> 33:00.959
LOOK, I KNOW WHAT GUYS LIKE.

33:00.959 --> 33:03.417
- NO.
- REBECCA?

33:03.417 --> 33:05.917
GO INSIDE.

33:11.333 --> 33:13.917
- SALLY, IT'S NOT--
- SHH.

33:13.917 --> 33:16.917
I AM SO SORRY
ABOUT REBECCA'S BEHAVIOR.

33:16.917 --> 33:18.583
- OH.

33:18.583 --> 33:23.375
- JUST PLEASE DON'T SAY
ANYTHING TO ARTHUR.

33:26.125 --> 33:28.417
KYLE, YOU CAN'T.

33:28.417 --> 33:30.417
WHATEVER YOU DID
WITH REBECCA...

33:30.417 --> 33:31.834
- I DIDN'T.

33:31.834 --> 33:33.041
- WHATEVER YOU'RE
GOING TO DO,

33:33.041 --> 33:34.166
I DON'T CARE.

33:34.166 --> 33:36.333
JUST PLEASE,
I'M BEGGING YOU.

33:36.333 --> 33:38.542
DON'T TELL HIM.
- I WOULDN'T.

33:38.542 --> 33:41.125
I WOULDN'T.
I WON'T.

33:41.125 --> 33:43.333
- PLEASE.

33:43.333 --> 33:45.709
- YEAH, I PROMISE.

33:45.709 --> 33:47.792
- THANK YOU.

33:56.166 --> 33:59.417
- WHAT THE HELL IS HE DOING
TO THESE PEOPLE?

33:59.417 --> 34:04.542
[cell phone rings]

34:04.542 --> 34:05.542
RITA, HI.

34:05.542 --> 34:07.375
- HEY.
HOW FAR AWAY ARE YOU?

34:07.375 --> 34:10.583
- UH, PROBABLY
ABOUT AN HOUR OR SO.

34:10.583 --> 34:12.375
- ALL RIGHT, WELL,
I DON'T WANT YOU TO BE SURPRISED

34:12.375 --> 34:13.458
WHEN YOU GET HOME.

34:13.458 --> 34:14.542
- WHY?
WHAT?

34:14.542 --> 34:15.709
- CODY FELL INTO YOUR SHED.

34:15.709 --> 34:17.041
- WHAT?
IS HE OKAY?

34:17.041 --> 34:18.542
WHAT HAPPENED?
- WELL, HE'S FINE.

34:18.542 --> 34:21.041
HE HIT A WIFFLE BALL
ONTO THE TOP OF THE SHED,

34:21.041 --> 34:23.542
CLIMBED UP TO GET IT,
THE SKYLIGHT CRACKED...

34:23.542 --> 34:25.250
AND HE FELL THROUGH.

34:25.250 --> 34:28.125
ELLIOT WAS GONNA PUSH
ON THE AIR CONDITIONER.

34:28.125 --> 34:29.625
- NO, DON'T.

34:29.625 --> 34:31.542
- UH, HE DIDN'T.

34:31.542 --> 34:33.834
HE TOOK OFF THE DOOR
WITH AN AXE.

34:33.834 --> 34:36.250
- SO MY SHED HAS NO DOOR?

34:36.250 --> 34:38.125
- DEXTER, CODY WAS SCARED
AND CRYING, ALL RIGHT?

34:38.125 --> 34:40.333
I TOLD ELLIOT TO GET HIM
OUT HOWEVER HE COULD.

34:40.333 --> 34:41.667

OF COURSE.

34:41.667 --> 34:43.709
I'LL...

34:43.709 --> 34:45.333
THANK ELLIOT WHEN I GET HOME.

34:45.333 --> 34:47.291
- WELL, I'LL SEE YOU SOON,
OKAY?

34:47.291 --> 34:50.291
- [sighs]

34:50.291 --> 34:53.250
NO ONE CAN GET INTO
THE TRUNK'S FALSE BOTTOM.

34:53.250 --> 34:55.834
- YOU DIDN'T THINK ANYONE COULD
GET INTO YOUR SHED EITHER.

34:55.834 --> 34:59.542
- I GOTTA GET HOME NOW.

34:59.542 --> 35:02.667

35:02.667 --> 35:05.583
- ARTHUR, I JUST GOT A CALL
AND I THINK I HAVE TO--

35:05.583 --> 35:07.583
- [sharp breath]

35:07.583 --> 35:08.834
[winces]

35:08.834 --> 35:12.250
- JONAH, WHAT HAPPENED?

35:12.250 --> 35:14.917
- I WHACKED IT
ON THE COFFEE TABLE.

35:14.917 --> 35:16.417
- MY SON, THE KLUTZ.

35:16.417 --> 35:20.125
THIS TEAM HASN'T BEEN THE SAME
SINCE THEY TRADED JOHNSON.

35:20.125 --> 35:23.458
- WHAT ELSE WILL HE DO
TO JONAH IF I LEAVE?

35:34.583 --> 35:35.625
- [gasps]

35:35.625 --> 35:38.792
- TURKEY WRAPS, ICEES.

35:38.792 --> 35:40.959
- AND CUERVO SILVER.

35:40.959 --> 35:42.166
ONLY THE BEST FOR YOU.

35:42.166 --> 35:44.792
- [giggles]

35:49.667 --> 35:53.959
- YOU KNOW, I WAS THINKING...

35:53.959 --> 35:56.166
CARL HAAS'S WIFE GETS MUGGED.

35:56.166 --> 35:57.875
BOOM.
SHE'S DEAD.

35:57.875 --> 35:59.291
CARL GETS HIT BY A BUS.

35:59.291 --> 36:01.166
BOOM.
HE'S A VEGETABLE.

36:04.041 --> 36:05.834
- YOU NEVER KNOW WHEN YOU
WAKE UP IN THE MORNING

36:05.834 --> 36:06.875
WHAT THE DAY WILL BRING.

36:06.875 --> 36:10.125
- I LOVE YOU.

36:12.333 --> 36:14.375
I LOVE YOU.

36:20.625 --> 36:22.000
- ARE YOU SAYING THAT
BECAUSE YOU'RE AFRAID

36:22.000 --> 36:23.333
YOU'LL GET HIT BY A BUS?

36:23.333 --> 36:25.166
- NO. WELL...

36:25.166 --> 36:29.208
YES, BUT...

36:29.208 --> 36:32.542
I JUST WANT YOU TO KNOW
WHAT I KNOW

36:32.542 --> 36:34.166
BEFORE I DON'T KNOW IT

36:37.583 --> 36:40.750
AND I LOVE YOU.

36:40.750 --> 36:41.750
I LOVE YOU!

36:41.750 --> 36:43.125

36:43.125 --> 36:45.750
- I LOVE MARIA ESPERANZA
DI ALMA LAGUER--

36:45.750 --> 36:48.375
- SHH!
[laughs]

36:55.542 --> 36:57.000
- I'M NOT GONNA SAY IT.

37:01.250 --> 37:04.709
- YOU DON'T LOVE ME?

37:04.709 --> 37:08.875
- I'M AFRAID
IF I SAY IT...

37:08.875 --> 37:11.500
SOMETHING WILL HAPPEN,
LIKE YOU'LL GET HIT BY A BUS.

37:26.709 --> 37:29.041
SO WATCH OUT
FOR MOVING BUSES.

37:29.041 --> 37:31.208
[chuckles]

37:31.208 --> 37:34.083
'CAUSE I LOVE...

37:56.667 --> 37:58.083
ISN'T THANKSGIVING FUN?

37:58.083 --> 38:00.041
- THANK GOD IT'S ONLY
ONCE A YEAR.

38:00.041 --> 38:01.375
DO YOU HAVE ANY ICE?

38:01.375 --> 38:02.917
- NO.
PEAS ARE BETTER.

38:02.917 --> 38:05.583
COME ON, RITA.
GIVE PEAS A CHANCE.

38:05.583 --> 38:07.041

38:19.000 --> 38:20.792
DID YOU SAY, "RATS"?

38:20.792 --> 38:22.166
- [chuckles]

38:22.166 --> 38:24.125
I GUESS I'VE BEEN SPENDING
TOO MUCH TIME WITH THE KIDS.

38:24.125 --> 38:25.959
- [chuckles]

38:25.959 --> 38:28.291
- THANKS FOR THIS.

38:28.291 --> 38:31.917
- I LIKE TAKING CARE OF YOU.

38:42.834 --> 38:44.625
I AM SO SORRY.

38:44.625 --> 38:46.625
I DON'T KNOW WHAT
I WAS THINKING.

38:46.625 --> 38:47.959
- YEAH, I DON'T EITHER.

38:47.959 --> 38:49.417
- WELL, NO,
IT'S JUST

38:49.417 --> 38:51.333
WE HAVE THIS CONNECTION
AND IT'S NOT JUST BECAUSE

38:51.333 --> 38:52.625
WE'RE BOTH LONELY--

38:52.625 --> 38:53.959
- NO, I'M NOT LONELY.

38:53.959 --> 38:55.458
I HAVE DEXTER.

38:55.458 --> 38:57.667
- THE GUY WHO'S NEVER HOME?

39:15.917 --> 39:18.917
- HEY, UH...

39:18.917 --> 39:20.333
DEB, I'M GONNA TAKE OFF.

39:20.333 --> 39:21.500
NOT FEELING SO HOT.

39:21.500 --> 39:24.417
- OH, NO, YOU DON'T.

39:24.417 --> 39:26.291
HERE.

39:26.291 --> 39:27.542
YOU'RE MY WINGMAN.

39:27.542 --> 39:28.959
- NO, THIS FAMILY DOESN'T
REALLY NEED ME AROUND.

39:28.959 --> 39:30.417
I'LL SEE YOU AT THE--
- NO, NO, SHH!

39:30.417 --> 39:32.917
YOU BELONG HERE
AS MUCH AS ANYONE DOES.

39:32.917 --> 39:36.083
AND IF YOU GO, I'LL BE
THE ONE SINGLE PERSON HERE.

39:36.083 --> 39:37.125
I REALLY DON'T FEEL LIKE
REMEMBERING

39:37.125 --> 39:40.375
WHY THAT IS, YOU KNOW?

39:40.375 --> 39:42.208
WHY FRANK'S GONE.

39:42.208 --> 39:43.709
WHY I'M HERE.

39:43.709 --> 39:45.000
- YEAH.

39:45.000 --> 39:48.083
HEY...YEAH.
I'LL STAY.

39:48.083 --> 39:49.625
[sighs]

39:49.625 --> 39:51.166
BUT I NEED BOOZE.

39:51.166 --> 39:53.583

40:01.875 --> 40:04.750

40:04.750 --> 40:08.166
- ARE YOU THE ONE MY MOM
TOLD ME NOT TO TALK TO?

40:08.166 --> 40:11.375
- AWKWARD.

40:11.375 --> 40:12.750

AMEN.

WE HAVE A LITTLE...

40:31.417 --> 40:32.875
FAMILY TRADITION, KYLE,

41:20.333 --> 41:22.375
GAVE US AN EXTRA TWO DAYS
TO FINISH OUR REPORT

41:22.375 --> 41:23.625
ON AESCHYLUS.

[laughter]

41:25.875 --> 41:31.041
AND I'M ALSO THANKFUL

41:31.041 --> 41:33.250

- UMI'M THANKFUL

42:07.166 --> 42:10.208
THANK YOU ALL FOR
THE COMFORT OF YOUR HOME.

42:10.208 --> 42:12.667
- WHERE NO ONE SAID
THEY WERE THANKFUL FOR ME.

42:12.667 --> 42:15.417
[chuckles]

42:15.417 --> 42:19.625
DID YOU, JONAH?

42:19.625 --> 42:22.333
DID YOU SAY YOU WERE THANKFUL
FOR ME, JONAH?

42:22.333 --> 42:23.500
WHAT'S THAT?

42:23.500 --> 42:27.917
- I DID NOT SAY
I WAS THANKFUL FOR YOU...

42:27.917 --> 42:31.041
BECAUSE I'M NOT.

42:31.041 --> 42:34.125
- I AM SO THANKFUL
FOR YOU, ARTHUR.

42:34.125 --> 42:35.333

42:45.709 --> 42:47.333
- GO TO YOUR ROOM, VERA.

42:47.333 --> 42:48.417
- NO!
SHE'S NOT VERA!

42:48.417 --> 42:50.583
AND SHE'S NOT
YOUR GODDAMN PRISONER

42:50.583 --> 42:53.000
AND SHE'S NOT
EIGHT ANYMORE!

42:53.000 --> 42:54.875
THIS WHOLE LIFE--

42:54.875 --> 42:56.959
YOUR LIFE--
IS A LIE!

42:56.959 --> 42:59.709
THESE ARE LIES!

42:59.709 --> 43:01.709
FUCKING COMMUNITY HERO?

43:01.709 --> 43:02.959
- JONAH, THIS ISN'T THE WAY.

43:02.959 --> 43:05.709
[glass shatters]
[gasps]

43:05.709 --> 43:07.208
- I KNOW WHO YOU REALLY ARE.

43:07.208 --> 43:08.208
- OH, WHO AM I?

43:08.208 --> 43:12.583
- YOU'RE A KILLER.

43:12.583 --> 43:16.125
SUCKING THE FUCKING LIFE

MOM, BECCA, ME!

43:17.583 --> 43:19.083

43:19.083 --> 43:20.583
DON'T!
DADDY, NO!

43:20.583 --> 43:23.375
[screams]
- YOU'RE KILLING US!

43:23.375 --> 43:25.208
- PUT HER DOWN.

43:25.208 --> 43:27.583
- FUCK YOU AND FUCK VERA.

43:27.583 --> 43:29.625
- DON'T.

[choking]
FUCK YOU!

43:36.250 --> 43:40.417
[gasping]

43:40.417 --> 43:43.542

43:47.625 --> 43:49.333
NO, DADDY!
NO!

43:49.333 --> 43:52.125
- [grunting]

43:52.125 --> 43:53.125
- NO, YOU DON'T HAVE
TO KILL HIM!

43:53.125 --> 43:55.250
NO! DAD!
DAD!

43:58.792 --> 44:04.208
- I SHOULD HAVE FUCKING KILLED
YOU WHEN I HAD THE CHANCE.

44:04.208 --> 44:05.625
- [screams]

44:05.625 --> 44:07.083
OH, MY GOD!

44:07.083 --> 44:08.667
ARTHUR!

44:10.625 --> 44:13.959
- SALLY.

44:13.959 --> 44:16.083
- [grunting]

44:16.083 --> 44:18.625
THANKFUL TO BE OUT
OF THAT FUCKING HOUSE!

44:18.625 --> 44:21.000
- YOU SHOWED TRINITY
THE MONSTER IN YOU.

44:21.000 --> 44:22.458
HE'LL SEE YOU COMING NOW.

44:22.458 --> 44:24.667
- I DON'T KNOW.
SEEING THEM LIKE THAT--

44:24.667 --> 44:26.625
HE'S DESTROYED EVERYONE
IN THAT FAMILY.

44:26.625 --> 44:29.166
- THAT'S WHAT HAPPENS TO PEOPLE
WHO LIVE WITH A MONSTER.

44:29.166 --> 44:32.250
- I AM NOTHING LIKE HIM!

44:32.250 --> 44:34.000
MY FAMILY IS NOTHING
LIKE THAT.

44:34.000 --> 44:35.875
- WHAT'S 18 MORE YEARS OF BEING
WITH YOU GONNA DO TO THEM?

44:35.875 --> 44:39.583
- ARTHUR'S TERRORIZED THEM
INTO MAINTAINING HIS COVER.

44:39.583 --> 44:41.417
THEY'RE NOTHING
BUT HUMAN SHIELDS.

44:41.417 --> 44:45.834
- THE ONLY REASON YOU STARTED
DATING RITA WAS FOR COVER.

44:45.834 --> 44:47.500
- [sighs]

44:47.500 --> 44:49.125
SHE'S MUCH MORE THAN THAT NOW.

44:49.125 --> 44:52.041
SHE AND THE KIDS.
MUCH MORE.

44:56.125 --> 44:59.041
MY FAMILY IS NOTHING
LIKE THAT.

45:03.250 --> 45:05.291
HEY.
- HEY.

45:05.291 --> 45:06.792
- DEXTER'S HOME!

45:06.792 --> 45:07.792
- WHO'S HUNGRY?

45:07.792 --> 45:09.375
- ME.
- I AM.

45:09.375 --> 45:12.792
- I AM SO HAPPY
YOU'RE HOME.

45:12.792 --> 45:15.083
- OH, ME TOO.

45:15.083 --> 45:16.125
- MM.

45:16.125 --> 45:19.125
MM.

45:19.125 --> 45:21.041
[chuckles]
ALL RIGHT.

45:21.041 --> 45:23.792
UH, CODY, WHY DON'T YOU HELP
YOUR AUNT DEB SET THE TABLE?

45:23.792 --> 45:28.333
ASTOR, I CAN USE YOUR HELP
IN THE KITCHEN.

45:28.333 --> 45:30.875
- SORRY ABOUT YOUR SHED,
DEXTER.

45:30.875 --> 45:33.750
- HEY.

45:33.750 --> 45:35.041
HUH.

45:35.041 --> 45:38.500
AS LONG AS YOU'RE OKAY,
THAT'S ALL THAT MATTERS.

45:41.583 --> 45:43.417
[sighs]
I'M GONNA GO CHECK ON THE SHED.

45:43.417 --> 45:45.709
MAKE SURE IT'S SAFE IN THERE.

45:45.709 --> 45:49.083
- MISS US?

45:49.083 --> 45:50.875
- YOU HAVE NO IDEA.

45:59.792 --> 46:02.083
GOD, I MISS MY APARTMENT.

46:08.083 --> 46:10.041
[sighs]

46:10.041 --> 46:12.083
THEY'RE SAFE.

46:12.083 --> 46:13.875
SO'S MY TRUNK.

46:18.250 --> 46:20.375
- IS ANYTHING
REALLY SAFE HERE?

46:20.375 --> 46:25.083
THE KIDS, RITA?

46:25.083 --> 46:26.208
YOU?

46:26.208 --> 46:28.750
- I'LL FIND AN ALTERNATIVE.

46:32.834 --> 46:35.959
- TRINITY WAS SUPPOSED
TO BE THE ALTERNATIVE.

46:42.166 --> 46:45.917
- UH, SPOONS GO INSIDE
OR OUTSIDE THE KNIVES?

46:45.917 --> 46:48.375
- UM...

46:48.375 --> 46:51.333
SURPRISE US.

46:51.333 --> 46:52.458
OUCH.

46:52.458 --> 46:54.959
- CAN I SEE YOUR SCARS,
AUNT DEB?

46:57.291 --> 46:59.333
- SURE.

47:02.458 --> 47:05.083
- DOES IT STILL HURT?

47:05.083 --> 47:08.291
- UM...

47:08.291 --> 47:11.291
SOMETIMES...

47:11.291 --> 47:12.542
HERE.

47:12.542 --> 47:17.667
- DID YOU SEE THAT GUY DIE?

47:17.667 --> 47:20.291
- I DID.

47:20.291 --> 47:21.834
LOOKED RIGHT IN HIS EYES.

47:21.834 --> 47:23.542
- WERE HIS EYES OPEN?

47:23.542 --> 47:27.125
- YEAH.

47:27.125 --> 47:30.041
WATCHED HIM TAKE HIS
LAST BREATH.

47:34.542 --> 47:35.625
HOW DID SHE KNOW THAT?

47:35.625 --> 47:37.583
- HOW DID WHO KNOW WHAT?

47:37.583 --> 47:41.417
- NOBODY BUT ME.

47:41.417 --> 47:43.875
HOW MUCH DID YOU TELL CHRISTINE
ABOUT THE LUNDY SHOOTING?

47:43.875 --> 47:45.166
- NOTHING.

47:45.166 --> 47:46.667
- WELL, MAYBE YOU LEFT
LUNDY'S FILE

47:46.667 --> 47:48.083
LYING AROUND ACCIDENTALLY.

47:48.083 --> 47:49.166
- NO.

47:49.166 --> 47:51.542
- AND MAYBE CHRISTINE SAW SOME
OF THE PICTURES.

47:51.542 --> 47:53.250
SHE SAW HOW HE WAS LYING
ON HIS SIDE,

47:53.250 --> 47:54.917
HOW HE FELL IN FRONT OF ME,
SO THAT I COULD SEE HIM

47:54.917 --> 47:56.250
TAKE HIS LAST--

47:56.250 --> 47:59.208
- MORGAN, I'M TELLING YOU,
I LEARNED MY LESSON.

47:59.208 --> 48:01.083
I NEVER EVEN TOOK THE LUNDY
FILES OUT OF THE STATION.

48:01.083 --> 48:03.000
THERE'S NO WAY SHE
COULD HAVE SEEN IT.

48:06.709 --> 48:11.375
- DINNER'S READY.

48:11.375 --> 48:15.375
- NOT ALL HAPPY FAMILIES
ARE ALIKE.

48:15.375 --> 48:17.875
THEY ARE HAPPY...

48:17.875 --> 48:20.083
AREN'T THEY?

48:20.083 --> 48:23.500
ARE THEY NORMAL KIDS?

48:23.500 --> 48:28.709
HOW CAN YOU TELL A LOVING WIFE
FROM A FRIGHTENED ONE?

48:28.709 --> 48:31.166
A FRIENDLY NEIGHBOR.

48:31.166 --> 48:33.041
CO-WORKER.

48:33.041 --> 48:34.875
SISTER.

48:34.875 --> 48:37.834
SON.

48:37.834 --> 48:41.083
ARE ANY OF THEM
WHAT THEY SEEM?

48:41.083 --> 48:45.375
OR ARE THEY LITTLE BOMBS
WAITING TO EXPLODE?

48:45.375 --> 48:48.792
- HAPPY THANKSGIVING, SON.

48:48.792 --> 48:52.500
- DEXTER?
EVERYTHING OKAY?

48:52.500 --> 48:54.917
- YEAH.

48:54.917 --> 48:56.375
IT IS, ISN'T IT?
[sighs]

48:56.375 --> 48:59.083
- YES.

48:59.083 --> 49:02.417
EVERYTHING IS EXACTLY
THE WAY IT SHOULD BE.

49:02.417 --> 49:06.417
PERFECT.

49:06.417 --> 49:07.917
- YEAH, YOU'RE RIGHT.

49:07.917 --> 49:09.250
- WHY DON'T WE GO AROUND
THE TABLE AND EVERYBODY

49:09.250 --> 49:10.250
SAY WHAT THEY'RE THANKFUL FOR?

49:10.250 --> 49:12.750
- NO!

49:12.750 --> 49:15.250
I DON'T WANT THIS YUMMY FOOD
TO GET COLD.

49:15.250 --> 49:17.709
- I'M THANKFUL FOR DEXTER.

49:22.667 --> 49:25.750
- LET'S EAT.

49:29.625 --> 49:31.083
- SURE YOU DON'T WANT TO STAY?

49:31.083 --> 49:32.792
- I'M TOO TIRED
TO SPEND THE NIGHT.

49:32.792 --> 49:34.208
YOU MADE SURE OF THAT.

49:34.208 --> 49:36.792
- [chuckles]

49:36.792 --> 49:38.625
- SEE YOU TOMORROW?

49:38.625 --> 49:42.083
- AND THE DAY AFTER THAT
AND AFTER THAT.

49:44.458 --> 49:46.625
I'M HERE IF YOU
CHANGE YOUR MIND.

49:46.625 --> 49:48.583
- GOOD NIGHT.

49:48.583 --> 49:51.417
- GOOD NIGHT.

50:00.083 --> 50:04.125
[sighs]

50:04.125 --> 50:07.166
[knock on door]

50:07.166 --> 50:09.208
JOEY.

50:13.458 --> 50:16.834
HI, DAD.
