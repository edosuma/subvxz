just trying to help.

01:51.143 --> 01:53.478
Since when?

01:54.546 --> 01:56.682
You're no better than
the rest of them.

01:58.984 --> 02:00.719
Look, can we just talk?

02:00.819 --> 02:02.721
I know this has
been rough on you.

02:02.821 --> 02:05.057
Do you?

02:05.157 --> 02:07.859
You don't care how

So we'll start with the most
important room in the whole house.

02:29.915 --> 02:31.083
This is the kitchen,

02:31.183 --> 02:34.419
and it was completely remodeled
about five years ago.

02:34.519 --> 02:37.789
And as you can see they put
in beautiful cherry cabinets,

02:37.889 --> 02:42.327
that I love, and these cute
tile accents in the backsplash,

02:42.427 --> 02:44.329
and the, um...

02:44.429 --> 02:48.467
open floor plan
for entertaining.

02:50.202 --> 02:52.070
Uh... what else?

02:52.170 --> 02:54.306
The neighborhood is wonderful,

02:54.406 --> 02:56.274
and the schools are fantastic.

02:56.375 --> 02:58.777
My daughter Dina plays for the
varsity field hockey team,

02:58.877 --> 03:01.346
and she just got
recruited by Price.

03:01.446 --> 03:02.981
I'm a proud mom, so I brag.

03:03.081 --> 03:05.550
She got a scholarship
and everything.

03:06.652 --> 03:07.886
Do you guys have kids?

03:13.058 --> 03:14.793
Mom?

03:43.722 --> 03:45.157
OK. Oh!

03:45.257 --> 03:47.392
Damn it!

03:48.760 --> 03:50.262
Damn it!

03:50.362 --> 03:53.498
That's it.

03:56.068 --> 04:00.238
I wish I could just...

04:00.338 --> 04:02.741
fast forward my life.

04:02.841 --> 04:05.343
See how this all turns out.

04:05.444 --> 04:09.815
If I actually make it through.

04:14.386 --> 04:16.088
Stop dripping.

04:16.188 --> 04:18.990
Anyway...

04:19.091 --> 04:22.661
I can't... I can't
do this right now.

04:28.467 --> 04:30.268
Dina?

04:30.368 --> 04:33.038
Hey, sweetie. I'm home.

04:33.138 --> 04:35.073
Sorry, I know.

04:35.173 --> 04:36.942
I know, I'm late again.

04:37.042 --> 04:40.045
Thought I was gonna get
a speeding ticket.

04:40.145 --> 04:42.814
I tried.

04:42.914 --> 04:44.282
Oh.

04:44.382 --> 04:46.284
You didn't want Chinese?

04:46.384 --> 04:49.588
Well, if you're lucky,
I'll cook pasta.

04:49.688 --> 04:53.759
If you're lucky, we can order
in from somewhere else.

04:54.226 --> 04:55.093
Sweetie?

04:55.193 --> 04:57.028
Oh, come on.

04:57.129 --> 04:58.563
Dina!

04:58.663 --> 05:00.565
I'm starving.

05:30.796 --> 05:32.964
Come on, girls.

05:37.903 --> 05:41.606
That's it, stay together.
Work together.

05:41.706 --> 05:42.808
All right, Dina.

05:42.908 --> 05:44.676
Great shot!

05:44.776 --> 05:47.212
That's what I'm talking about!
Nice!

05:47.312 --> 05:50.415
Good job, girls. Nice teamwork.

05:50.515 --> 05:51.635
All right, let's line it up.

05:51.683 --> 05:53.652
Let's hustle!

05:57.022 --> 05:58.022
Sub!

05:58.056 --> 06:00.091
Claire, you're up.

06:02.594 --> 06:04.062
You OK, Dina?

06:04.162 --> 06:06.565
Oh, fine. Just my ankle. I
just gotta re-tape it again.

06:06.665 --> 06:08.166
- All right, good job.
- Thanks.

06:08.266 --> 06:10.902
Let's line it up! Hustle!

06:22.047 --> 06:25.851
Owww!

06:38.530 --> 06:40.398
Hi.

06:40.498 --> 06:42.634
- Hi, honey.
- Sorry I'm late.

06:42.734 --> 06:43.935
I rushed. All right.

06:44.035 --> 06:45.503
- How we doing?
- It's a close game.

06:45.604 --> 06:47.014
It's 2-1, they're
playing really good,

06:47.038 --> 06:48.807
but this other
team is very good.

06:48.907 --> 06:51.610
Oh, God, Skylar's playing great.

06:51.710 --> 06:53.321
She is, she's kinda
keeping us in the game.

06:53.345 --> 06:54.613
She's killin' it.

06:54.713 --> 06:55.780
Where's Dina?

06:55.881 --> 06:58.350
Oh, uh... she's on the bench.

06:58.450 --> 06:59.818
- Ankle?
- Yep.

06:59.918 --> 07:02.621
Don't worry, they're taping it.

07:08.226 --> 07:10.862
Come on, Skylar!

07:10.962 --> 07:12.430
Concentrate!

07:12.530 --> 07:14.165
She's doing all right.

07:14.266 --> 07:15.843
I spent all that money
on that summer clinic,

07:15.867 --> 07:17.936
and she cannot keep
her stick down.

07:18.970 --> 07:21.640
Hey. Congratulations
about Price.

07:21.740 --> 07:23.408
I'm really thrilled for her.

07:23.508 --> 07:24.788
- It's a good thing.
- I am too.

07:24.843 --> 07:26.444
It's good. It's so good.

07:26.544 --> 07:27.784
How about Sky, how she's doing?

07:27.812 --> 07:30.482
- Oh. Make up your mind!
- Oh, she will.

07:30.582 --> 07:33.118
She will, but she's
taking her time

07:33.218 --> 07:34.886
and it's making me a little...

07:34.986 --> 07:37.689
She's got time. Ah,
she's a good girl.

07:37.789 --> 07:39.591
- Yeah, she does.
- Hey, Mrs. Reid.

07:39.691 --> 07:41.526
Oh, my God, Mrs. V. Did
you see Dina's goal?

07:41.626 --> 07:42.694
I did.

07:42.794 --> 07:44.071
Mom, can we give
Claire a ride home?

07:44.095 --> 07:45.397
No. Yes, get in.

07:45.497 --> 07:46.998
We always give her a ride home.

07:47.098 --> 07:48.900
- Bye, Sky.
- - Good game, Sky.

07:49.000 --> 07:50.769
Thanks, you too. I'll
see you tomorrow.

07:50.869 --> 07:52.637
Hey. I'm proud of you.

07:52.737 --> 07:54.973
Thanks, Mom.

08:00.879 --> 08:03.982
Needless to say, this has
been a difficult year.

08:04.082 --> 08:07.852
But for our team, a
very successful one.

08:07.953 --> 08:10.989
Twelve and three.
And the league MVP,

08:11.089 --> 08:12.824
Skylar Reid.

08:15.293 --> 08:16.294
Congratulations.

08:16.394 --> 08:17.963
- Well done.
- Thanks.

08:21.466 --> 08:25.136
And congrats on your early
acceptance to Price as well,

08:25.236 --> 08:26.771
that is very good news.

08:26.871 --> 08:31.376
Now I would like to award the
individual varsity letters.

08:32.611 --> 08:35.647
If there's anything you need.
I mean...

08:35.746 --> 08:36.746
Anything at all.

08:39.583 --> 08:41.019
First, I would like to award

08:41.119 --> 08:43.254
a posthumous varsity letter.

08:43.355 --> 08:44.923
To Dina Van Cleve.

08:45.023 --> 08:48.460
Her mother, Rachel, is here
to receive Dina's letter.

09:16.721 --> 09:19.624
Rachel. Hang on for a sec.

09:19.724 --> 09:24.195
I'm sorry, this was too soon.

09:24.295 --> 09:26.798
The team wanted
you to have this.

09:26.898 --> 09:30.035
Skylar had all the girls
sign their names.

09:30.135 --> 09:32.170
Oh, sweetie.

09:32.270 --> 09:36.074
I am so sorry.

09:38.143 --> 09:40.478
If there's anything
that I can do...

11:17.675 --> 11:22.046
she always flips to the last page
of the book before she reads it.

11:22.147 --> 11:26.017
She says she doesn't want to
waste her time on a story

11:26.117 --> 11:29.487
if it ends badly.

11:29.587 --> 11:33.258
I guess she'd tell
me to start there.

11:33.858 --> 11:35.894
She would...

11:35.994 --> 11:39.264
if we were still speaking.

11:42.967 --> 11:46.671
I've spent the past
few weeks being...

11:46.771 --> 11:49.407
absolutely tortured

11:49.507 --> 11:54.112
by the people that I
used to call my friends.

11:54.212 --> 11:57.448
They...

11:57.549 --> 12:01.052
I can't... I can't
do this right now.

12:12.997 --> 12:15.333
North Carolina?

12:24.609 --> 12:25.910
Jealous, Van Cleve?

12:26.010 --> 12:27.879
It's better in high res.

12:27.979 --> 12:29.581
Who is this?

12:29.681 --> 12:31.049
Hello?

12:31.149 --> 12:32.660
Do you think it's funny
sending filth like this

12:32.684 --> 12:35.186
- to my daughter's phone?
- What? No, I...

12:35.286 --> 12:37.255
Who is this? What is your name?

12:37.355 --> 12:38.957
- Valerie.
- Valerie who?

12:39.057 --> 12:41.559
I played field hockey
with Dina last year.

12:41.659 --> 12:43.127
Look, Mrs. Van Cleve,

12:43.228 --> 12:45.797
Dina didn't know I was gonna
send her that, I swear.

12:45.897 --> 12:48.666
So, please don't be mad at her.

12:48.766 --> 12:50.368
Anyway, I'm really sorry.

12:50.468 --> 12:53.972
Could you just let her know
that I'm back in town.

12:57.075 --> 12:58.509
We should talk.

12:58.610 --> 13:01.913
Oh, my God.

13:02.013 --> 13:04.382
I had no idea.

13:06.551 --> 13:09.687
I think... Dina was
being harassed

13:09.787 --> 13:11.956
at school before she died.

13:12.056 --> 13:13.658
So when I saw the
picture you sent,

13:13.758 --> 13:16.628
I automatically assumed it was you.
I'm sorry.

13:16.728 --> 13:17.962
Of course.

13:18.062 --> 13:20.298
God, I feel like such an idiot.

13:21.299 --> 13:23.801
Did she ever say
anything to you?

13:23.901 --> 13:27.305
About feeling like she was
being bullied at school?

13:28.139 --> 13:30.208
We haven't talked in awhile.

13:30.308 --> 13:32.710
I just got back from a
semester in South Africa.

13:32.810 --> 13:35.380
I've been unplugged for months.

13:35.480 --> 13:37.749
Are you close with
any of her friends?

13:37.849 --> 13:39.083
Not really.

13:39.183 --> 13:42.287
I mean, I know some of
them from the team.

13:45.056 --> 13:47.158
I want to understand

13:47.258 --> 13:49.494
what she went through.

13:49.594 --> 13:51.996
But honestly, I...

13:52.096 --> 13:53.631
I don't even know
where to start.

13:53.731 --> 13:56.100
Have you tried looking online?

13:56.200 --> 13:59.370
I mean, if she had a falling
out with her friends

13:59.470 --> 14:02.173
it's probably
catalogued somewhere.

14:02.273 --> 14:03.975
These days, most dirty laundry

14:04.075 --> 14:05.576
is offered up for
public consumption.

14:05.677 --> 14:08.880
Would I still be able to
find it after all this time?

14:08.980 --> 14:11.883
The Internet never forgets.

14:11.983 --> 14:16.421
When was the first time you
thought something might be wrong?

14:16.521 --> 14:17.955
Homecoming.

14:18.056 --> 14:20.425
- OK, everybody get together.
- - Everybody smile.

14:20.525 --> 14:22.827
- Skylar, honey, stand up straight.
- - Bigger teeth.

14:22.927 --> 14:25.496
- All right. Oh, God, they're beautiful.
- They're stunning.

14:25.596 --> 14:27.975
- One, two, three.
- - Wait, you guys get in a little closer.

14:27.999 --> 14:30.668
Homecoming!

14:30.768 --> 14:31.969
- Smile!
- Big smiles.

14:32.070 --> 14:34.138
Perfect.

14:34.238 --> 14:35.773
- Good?
- Done yet?

14:35.873 --> 14:37.041
Very pretty.

14:37.141 --> 14:39.510
- Get outta here!
- Have a great time.

14:41.012 --> 14:42.046
Wait, wait.

14:42.146 --> 14:43.948
You look beautiful.

14:44.048 --> 14:45.583
Thank you very much.

14:45.683 --> 14:48.720
Now, can you fit everything you
need in that little bitty purse?

14:48.820 --> 14:50.054
Like money and ID?

14:50.154 --> 14:53.958
Well, I am not driving
and I can't buy alcohol.

14:54.058 --> 14:56.160
Or drink yet.

14:56.260 --> 14:58.363
So, listen, I went
to high school once.

14:58.463 --> 15:00.064
- Really?
- Mm-hmm.

15:00.164 --> 15:02.533
And I know that there's
a lot of pressure

15:02.633 --> 15:03.534
on a night like tonight.

15:03.634 --> 15:06.938
And people have... wait.

15:07.038 --> 15:09.540
People have expectations,

15:09.640 --> 15:11.518
and I'm just trying to tell
you that you don't ever,

15:11.542 --> 15:14.679
ever have to do anything you're not
100 percent comfortable doing.

15:14.779 --> 15:16.714
Like the Electric Slide?

15:18.282 --> 15:20.485
- Come on, Mama, you can save the PSA.
- Mm-hmm.

15:20.585 --> 15:22.787
It's just gonna be some
friends hanging out.

15:22.887 --> 15:26.457
Making a lifetime of memories.

15:26.557 --> 15:29.293
- Good, clean fun.
- Love you.

15:29.394 --> 15:30.394
- Love you too.
- Bye.

15:30.461 --> 15:32.130
- Bye.
- Have fun.

15:32.230 --> 15:33.574
- OK, one more, one more.
- Take a picture.

15:33.598 --> 15:35.299
Pretty.

15:37.969 --> 15:40.638
All right, let's take
one of you and I.

Nothing.

16:10.501 --> 16:14.739
Can we just slow down for a sec?

16:14.839 --> 16:17.508
How slow are we talking?

16:18.509 --> 16:21.746
Really, really, really slow.

16:22.246 --> 16:24.348
I'm sorry.

16:25.683 --> 16:27.127
You said Homecoming
would be the night.

16:27.151 --> 16:29.454
- I know, I...
- I got you flowers.

16:29.554 --> 16:32.123
I got us this room at
the Beechwood, which...

16:32.223 --> 16:33.057
wasn't cheap.

16:33.157 --> 16:34.892
I know, I just...

16:34.992 --> 16:37.528
I thought I would be
ready, but I'm...

16:38.796 --> 16:39.997
I'm just not. I'm sorry.

16:43.701 --> 16:44.702
So, now what?

16:46.771 --> 16:50.274
Maybe you should
just take me home.

16:55.780 --> 16:57.582
You know, it's not
that big of a deal.

16:57.682 --> 16:59.317
Yeah, well...

16:59.417 --> 17:01.519

and you're home before midnight.

17:38.890 --> 17:40.591
Yeah, the dance ended at ten.

17:40.691 --> 17:44.028
Rest of the night was
kinda uneventful.

17:44.128 --> 17:46.397
- Sweetie?
- Yeah?

17:46.497 --> 17:48.132
Did you win Homecoming Queen?

17:48.232 --> 17:49.367
Yeah.

17:49.467 --> 17:51.802
That's fantastic!
Congratulations.

17:51.903 --> 17:54.005
It's not that big
of a deal, Mom.

17:54.105 --> 17:55.139
It is a big deal.

17:55.239 --> 17:56.416
Oh, my God. When I was your age,

17:56.440 --> 17:58.075
it was like the
biggest deal ever.

17:58.175 --> 18:01.012
Seriously, they had
posters and pins

18:01.112 --> 18:02.446
and cupcake bribes.

18:02.547 --> 18:04.882
I swear, it was like a
presidential election.

18:04.982 --> 18:08.819
Except possibly for the cupcake
part cause that would be odd.

18:09.921 --> 18:12.223
So, something happened
with Mark, didn't it?

18:12.323 --> 18:13.891
Why would you say that?

18:13.991 --> 18:16.294
I can tell.

18:17.195 --> 18:18.763
Did you...

18:19.297 --> 18:20.197
You know.

18:20.298 --> 18:23.668
Mom, no!

18:23.768 --> 18:25.503
You can talk to me
about stuff like that.

18:25.603 --> 18:27.884
Well, I don't want to talk to
you about my sex life, so...

18:27.939 --> 18:30.208
Are you telling me that
you have a sex life?

18:30.308 --> 18:32.176
No, that's not what I'm saying,

18:32.276 --> 18:33.311
I just...

18:33.411 --> 18:34.912
Will you please just get out?

18:35.012 --> 18:36.080
OK, I'm going.

18:36.180 --> 18:38.883
But...

18:38.983 --> 18:40.251
I'm around if you need me.

18:40.351 --> 18:42.153
I'm always around

18:42.253 --> 18:44.789
You know that, right?

18:44.889 --> 18:45.889
Yes, I know.

18:45.923 --> 18:49.026
All right. I love you.

Claire, what the
hell's going on?

22:50.701 --> 22:53.204
Everyone in the school
has seen your picture.

22:54.839 --> 22:57.007
Oh, my God. Where are you
getting those from?!

22:57.107 --> 22:58.952
I don't know. I got it from
like ten different people.

22:58.976 --> 23:02.580
What? Oh, my... Just come here!

23:05.716 --> 23:07.051

What am I...

23:09.353 --> 23:11.856
OK, OK, just breathe.
Dina, Dina, breathe.

23:11.956 --> 23:13.490
OK, we can figure
this out together.

23:13.591 --> 23:16.026
We can figure it out.

23:17.561 --> 23:19.630
Oh, God.

23:26.770 --> 23:28.372
- I need a pen.
- What?

23:28.472 --> 23:30.574
I need a pen!

23:54.598 --> 23:55.966
How could you do that to me?

23:56.066 --> 23:58.502
I thought we meant
something to each other.

23:58.602 --> 24:00.638
- Shouldn't that be my line?
- Excuse me?

24:00.738 --> 24:02.115
First you blow me off at
Homecoming and now this?

24:02.139 --> 24:03.874
I don't get you.

24:03.974 --> 24:06.677
No, no. I sent that picture
to you and you alone,

24:06.777 --> 24:08.379
and now it is all
over the school.

24:08.479 --> 24:11.024
I just saw it this morning when a
bunch of people showed it to me.

24:11.048 --> 24:13.651
Stop lying. Seriously, why
did you send it out...

24:13.751 --> 24:16.887
Dina. I got a new
wallpaper today.

24:16.987 --> 24:19.390
You know, it's really hot.

24:19.490 --> 24:23.193
I'm thinking I should send
it in to Sexysexters.com.

24:23.294 --> 24:25.596
What do you think?

24:34.805 --> 24:38.776
Oh, God...

24:38.876 --> 24:41.645
I'd like the opportunity to speak
with each of these students.

24:41.745 --> 24:43.425
I have some questions
for them about Dina.

24:43.480 --> 24:46.550
And you think they'll be
able to give you answers?

24:46.650 --> 24:51.088
Yeah, well as founding members of the
"Dina Van Cleve is a Slut" Facebook page,

24:51.188 --> 24:53.657
I'm thinking they
might have a few.

24:58.862 --> 25:00.998
Katie Bishop.

25:01.098 --> 25:02.333
Michael Hatcher.

25:02.433 --> 25:05.135
Peter Lambert.

25:10.741 --> 25:13.243
I can't help you.

25:14.278 --> 25:16.280
You can't help me, or
you won't help me?

25:16.380 --> 25:19.116
Can't. They don't
go to school here.

25:19.216 --> 25:21.485
Of course they go to school
here, how can they not?

25:21.585 --> 25:24.288
Dummy accounts.

25:24.388 --> 25:26.924
It's common with cyber bullying.
It's a way to remain anonymous.

25:27.024 --> 25:31.028
OK... Well, you monitor computer
activity in the school, right?

25:31.128 --> 25:33.030
Can't I tell who had
access to the page?

25:33.130 --> 25:34.598
Mrs. Van Cleve,

25:34.698 --> 25:38.502
what is it that you're
hoping to do with this?

25:38.602 --> 25:43.073
These kids hurt my daughter.

25:43.173 --> 25:45.809
I want to know why they did it,
I want to know who it was.

25:45.909 --> 25:50.280
Dina's death was a tragedy.

25:50.381 --> 25:53.884
And we all want closure.

25:53.984 --> 25:59.957
But I can't have you turning
my school upside down.

26:00.057 --> 26:04.561
If you need something,
you get it through me.

26:04.661 --> 26:08.866
Fine. Good. I need the ISP
records from the computer labs.

26:08.966 --> 26:13.037
You won't find anything there.

26:14.304 --> 26:18.342
Mrs. Van Cleve, please. Think
about what you are doing.

26:18.442 --> 26:22.212
This is a can of worms
you do not want to open.

26:25.215 --> 26:27.651
Um, I'm here if
you want to talk.

26:27.751 --> 26:29.353
Oh, are you?

26:46.804 --> 26:47.871
Mark, hi.

26:47.971 --> 26:50.274
Can I talk to you
for just a second?

26:50.374 --> 26:53.677
Yeah, um, but I only have a few
minutes until my next class.

26:53.777 --> 26:55.813
It's OK. It's all right.

27:01.118 --> 27:03.087
What do you know about this?

27:05.456 --> 27:07.891
Did Dina send it to you?

27:10.694 --> 27:11.929
Yeah, she did.

27:12.029 --> 27:13.564
Who did you send it to?

27:13.664 --> 27:14.932
No one.

27:15.032 --> 27:17.334
You're trying to tell me
that nobody saw this?

27:17.434 --> 27:21.405
Who did you send it to?

27:21.505 --> 27:24.608
Look, I didn't do it. And I
don't know anything about it.

27:24.708 --> 27:26.152
Mark, please, I know
you care about her.

27:26.176 --> 27:28.178
Please tell me how this got out.

27:29.646 --> 27:32.683
Look, I'm sorry about Dina.

27:32.783 --> 27:34.785
I really am.

27:34.885 --> 27:37.554
I don't know what to tell you.

27:37.654 --> 27:40.390
I'm late for my class.

27:52.402 --> 27:54.471
Claire.

27:55.372 --> 27:56.507
Hi, Mrs. V.

27:56.607 --> 27:59.409
Hi. Hi.

28:01.145 --> 28:02.813
I wanted to talk to
you for a second.

28:02.913 --> 28:05.582
If I can, about something.
Is that all right?

28:05.682 --> 28:09.486
Sure... What?

28:09.586 --> 28:13.390
I want you to help me understand
why Dina did what she did.

28:13.490 --> 28:15.058
Oh, Mrs. V.

28:15.159 --> 28:17.194
I really miss her. But...

28:17.294 --> 28:22.866
I found a video that Dina
was making on the computer.

28:22.966 --> 28:27.037
And in it, she talks pretty
intimately about what was

28:27.137 --> 28:28.739
going on at school
before she died.

28:28.839 --> 28:32.242
This video seemed like it was the
last in a series she was making.

28:32.342 --> 28:36.246
Like it was some kind
of diary or something.

28:36.346 --> 28:37.881
Do you know anything about this?

28:37.981 --> 28:41.718
Sure, I knew that she
made a few of those.

28:41.818 --> 28:44.288
Sometimes she'd even post
them online and stuff,

28:44.388 --> 28:46.523
depending on what
she had to say.

28:47.724 --> 28:49.126
Where can I find them?

28:49.226 --> 28:54.698
She took down her page a
few days before she...

28:54.798 --> 28:56.533
Before.

28:56.633 --> 28:59.403
Claire?

29:01.038 --> 29:03.140
Please help me with this.

29:05.275 --> 29:07.844
Dina...

29:07.945 --> 29:09.913
Well, she wouldn't talk to me.

29:10.013 --> 29:12.082
About what she was
going through.

29:13.483 --> 29:17.054
I really feel like she
wanted to protect me.

29:17.154 --> 29:21.925
But, if she confided
in those videos...

29:22.025 --> 29:24.661
I need to see them.

29:24.761 --> 29:26.163
I need to understand this.

29:26.263 --> 29:30.601
I wish I could help you, but I can't.
I'm sorry.

29:30.701 --> 29:33.403
Why weren't the two of
you speaking, Claire?

29:33.503 --> 29:36.039
I don't know what...

29:36.139 --> 29:39.142
She talked about
it in the video.

29:39.243 --> 29:42.112
Some dumb fight, I guess.

29:42.212 --> 29:44.781
I don't remember.

29:44.882 --> 29:46.917
What else does she say?

29:48.652 --> 29:52.322
If you think of anywhere I
might be able to find them,

29:52.422 --> 29:54.858
will you call me?
Will you do that?

29:54.958 --> 29:57.527
I'm gonna keep
looking on my end.

30:18.415 --> 30:20.217
Claire, seriously?

30:20.317 --> 30:22.719
Can you get, like a poker
face or something?

30:22.819 --> 30:24.154
I don't even know
what that means.

30:24.254 --> 30:26.390
Oh, my God. OK. It means
this is really important

30:26.490 --> 30:28.558
so I'm going to need you
to pull it together.

30:30.260 --> 30:32.929
OK.

30:33.030 --> 30:36.133
Claire. I'm trusting you.

30:36.233 --> 30:37.901
I got it covered, OK?

31:02.926 --> 31:03.960
Hi.

31:04.061 --> 31:05.796
Hi, Mrs. V.

31:05.896 --> 31:10.334
I thought I'd come see if we can
find any more of Dina's vlogs.

31:11.168 --> 31:12.936
Thank you.

31:13.036 --> 31:15.005
My friend, Claire...

31:15.105 --> 31:19.376
she always flips to the last page
of the book before she reads it.

31:19.476 --> 31:23.013
She says she doesn't want to
waste her time on a story

31:23.113 --> 31:24.381
if it ends badly.

31:24.481 --> 31:27.718
I guess she'd tell
me to start there.

31:27.818 --> 31:30.120
She would...

31:30.220 --> 31:33.123
if we were still speaking.

31:36.193 --> 31:40.897
I've spent the past
few weeks being...

31:40.998 --> 31:42.933
absolutely tortured

31:43.033 --> 31:47.704
by the people that I
used to call my friends.

31:47.804 --> 31:49.206
They...

31:49.306 --> 31:54.111
I can't... I can't
do this right now.

31:57.948 --> 32:00.384
It's not easy to watch, is it?

32:00.484 --> 32:03.887
I've seen it so many
times, I think I'm numb.

32:03.987 --> 32:06.823
Who's she talking about, Claire?

32:09.593 --> 32:12.062
I don't know.

32:12.162 --> 32:14.664
I've seen the text.

32:20.103 --> 32:22.806
I'll dig around on there
and see what I can find.

32:22.906 --> 32:25.876
OK. I'll be right back.

32:25.976 --> 32:27.677
Thank you.

32:41.291 --> 32:43.827
Hi, may I please speak
to Bob Montgomery?

32:45.462 --> 32:48.565
Bob, hi, my name is
Rachel Van Cleve.

32:48.665 --> 32:51.401
And I wrote an article about
bullying in our high school

32:51.501 --> 32:53.737
and how I think the
administration is covering it up.

32:53.837 --> 32:58.608
And I think it would make a
really good op-ed piece.

32:58.708 --> 33:02.612
Great, OK. I'll proof it and
then I'll send it over.

33:02.712 --> 33:04.881
OK.

33:04.981 --> 33:06.716
Thanks. Bye.

33:21.198 --> 33:23.467
Did you find anything?

33:24.101 --> 33:25.635
No, nothing.

33:25.735 --> 33:27.904
I searched the
entire hard drive.

33:28.004 --> 33:30.340
I did too.

33:31.508 --> 33:33.410
Why would she do this?

33:33.510 --> 33:36.346
Why would she just
leave one file?

33:36.446 --> 33:39.449
So, you have seen this?

33:39.549 --> 33:43.487
Yeah, I have. I'm sorry I
didn't say anything before.

33:43.587 --> 33:47.824
It's just... I wanted to
protect Dina, I guess.

33:47.924 --> 33:49.926
Who sent it to you?

33:50.026 --> 33:52.462
I got it from my friend Sarah
who goes to Greenleaf.

33:52.562 --> 33:54.698
I guess she and Dina
were at an all-star camp

33:54.798 --> 33:56.366
this Fall or something.

33:57.267 --> 33:58.568
Hey! I know you.

33:58.668 --> 34:00.971
You go to Westfield, right?

34:01.071 --> 34:02.906
No, sorry.

34:03.006 --> 34:05.242
What are you, undercover?

34:05.342 --> 34:07.043
It says it right on
your water bottle.

34:07.143 --> 34:08.512
I'm totally great with faces.

34:08.612 --> 34:10.347
Anyway, I was at the
Covington game.

34:10.447 --> 34:12.215
You got a great shot.

34:12.315 --> 34:14.251
Oh. Thanks.

34:14.351 --> 34:16.186
Sorry, I'm Sarah. Midfielder.

34:16.286 --> 34:18.388
- Dina.
- And this is Karen.

34:18.487 --> 34:19.632
She's a forward for Evanston.

34:19.656 --> 34:21.391
- Heading to check in?
- Yeah.

34:21.491 --> 34:24.360
- It's right there. See ya.
- Thank you.

34:26.496 --> 34:29.266
Hey! Uh, Dina Van Cleve?

34:39.409 --> 34:41.811
All right! Nice job, Dina!

34:45.614 --> 34:48.418
Sarah wasn't kidding
about your shot.

34:48.518 --> 34:50.887
- Oh, thanks.
- I'm going to go grab a drink, want one?

34:50.987 --> 34:52.589
Yeah, sure.

35:00.263 --> 35:02.132
- She's right over there.
- Oh, my God.

35:02.232 --> 35:05.101
- Is that Dina?
- Oh, my God!

35:05.201 --> 35:06.336
No way...

35:23.954 --> 35:25.722
What happened?

35:27.157 --> 35:29.593
- Delete it.
- Oh, come on.

35:31.661 --> 35:33.263
God, I was blind.

35:33.363 --> 35:36.399
She seemed genuinely excited
to go to that camp,

35:36.499 --> 35:38.235
and then she came back
a different person.

35:38.335 --> 35:40.103
I didn't even notice.

35:40.203 --> 35:43.807
If all the kids at camp saw it.

35:43.907 --> 35:45.909
How far did it spread?

35:46.009 --> 35:49.179
It definitely went viral.

35:49.279 --> 35:51.114
It's probably everywhere.

35:51.214 --> 35:53.717
The mood is tense here this
morning at Westfield High,

35:53.817 --> 35:56.519
and nobody knows exactly
what will go on here today.

35:56.620 --> 35:58.989
The administration
is on high alert

35:59.089 --> 36:00.812
and parents are being
brought in on the

36:00.824 --> 36:02.559
investigation into the
death of Dina Van Cleve

36:02.659 --> 36:05.962
will be underway and the police will
have a presence at this school,

36:06.062 --> 36:09.266
as the details of her tragic
death are looked into.

36:09.366 --> 36:11.201
Rachel Van Cleve,
who's daughter Dina

36:11.301 --> 36:14.971
tragically took her own life,
has written a scathing article

36:15.071 --> 36:18.708
that was published today
in the Daily Exchange...

36:25.315 --> 36:29.519
Hey... Um, so, do you know what's going
on with all the reporters outside?

36:29.619 --> 36:31.921
They're here for
student reactions.

36:32.022 --> 36:34.724
- To what?
- Dina's mom wrote an article.

36:34.824 --> 36:36.459
Some news affiliates
picked it up.

36:36.559 --> 36:38.428
What are you talking about?

36:38.528 --> 36:40.330
"Bullying in our schools."

36:40.430 --> 36:41.765
OK.

36:41.865 --> 36:44.501
Wait, she actually wants
a police investigation?

36:44.601 --> 36:46.302
She wants someone to blame.

36:46.403 --> 36:49.806
OK. But, you don't think the police
would really get involved, right?

36:49.906 --> 36:53.610
I mean, Dina did kill herself.

37:01.351 --> 37:03.653
"Where's the community's
allegiance?

37:03.753 --> 37:05.789
Is it behind the teenage
girl who was bullied

37:05.889 --> 37:08.858
and tormented to the point
of taking her own life?

37:08.958 --> 37:11.594
Or, behind the
spit-shined reputations

37:11.695 --> 37:16.066
of the rest of the scholarship-greedy,
college bound, student body?

37:16.166 --> 37:21.004
This is criminal behavior and
it should not be tolerated..."

37:21.104 --> 37:22.439
And it goes on.

37:22.539 --> 37:25.775
I know, I know, she's
so angry, but...

37:25.875 --> 37:30.447
I think that a lot of people are
going to be really angry about this.

37:34.551 --> 37:35.819
- Hi.
- Hi.

37:35.919 --> 37:37.921
- How was your day?
- Weird.

37:38.021 --> 37:39.656
There were cops and
reporters everywhere

37:39.756 --> 37:41.224
when I got to school
this morning.

37:41.324 --> 37:42.859
Why?

37:42.959 --> 37:44.937
They're making a federal case out
of that whole bullying thing.

37:44.961 --> 37:47.097
That's ridiculous.

37:47.197 --> 37:50.533
I don't know. Everyone seems,
like, super freaked out.

37:50.633 --> 37:53.770
- Are you?
- No.

37:53.870 --> 37:55.538
I mean...

37:55.638 --> 37:58.441
I kind of said some stuff to
her after that text came out.

37:58.541 --> 38:00.110
Yeah, but you were
just kidding, right?

38:00.210 --> 38:02.245
- Yeah...
- I mean, it's high school

38:02.345 --> 38:03.646
it's what people do.

38:03.747 --> 38:07.117
- Everybody needs to relax.
- I guess.

38:07.217 --> 38:08.685
OK? Don't even think about it.

38:08.785 --> 38:09.986
OK.

38:25.168 --> 38:26.936
OK.

38:32.642 --> 38:37.480
- Did you know Dina Van Cleve?
- Uh, I... I can't really talk about it.

38:37.580 --> 38:39.816
Did something happen at
school the day she died?

38:39.916 --> 38:41.684
Did somebody say
anything to her?

38:41.785 --> 38:44.587
Or harass her in anyway?

38:46.589 --> 38:48.625
Please, Byron...

38:48.725 --> 38:50.302
Seriously, any tiny
bit of information...

38:50.326 --> 38:53.663
I'm sorry, but you're
wasting your time.

38:56.866 --> 38:58.268
OK.

38:58.368 --> 39:01.104
Hey, I don't mean with me.

39:01.204 --> 39:03.306
I mean here. At the school.

39:03.406 --> 39:05.975
You're not going to
find anyone here

39:06.075 --> 39:08.011
who's going to give you
what you're looking for.

39:08.111 --> 39:09.779
And we're under a
lot of pressure

39:09.879 --> 39:12.215
from the administration
to keep an even keel.

39:12.315 --> 39:14.260
I'm sorry, I don't have any
idea what you're talking about.

39:14.284 --> 39:18.188
I'm saying parents can be very
protective of their kids.

39:18.288 --> 39:21.825
Especially when it seems like
someone is intent on hurting them.

39:21.925 --> 39:24.194
And you didn't help
things with that article

39:24.294 --> 39:25.762
that you wrote in the paper.

39:25.862 --> 39:28.140
Where were these parents when
my daughter was being bullied?

39:28.164 --> 39:32.702
- Kids can be cruel.
- And adults should know better.

39:34.237 --> 39:35.839
Rachel?

39:35.939 --> 39:38.675
May I speak with
you in my office?

39:46.549 --> 39:50.186
The school made a lot of
mistakes when it came to Dina.

39:50.286 --> 39:53.556
But, maybe we can do
something to prevent another

39:53.656 --> 39:55.592
tragedy from happening
in the future.

39:55.692 --> 39:58.261
I'm starting a
school-wide campaign,

39:58.361 --> 40:00.763
and a discussion group
called, "Kindness Matters."

40:00.864 --> 40:04.334
It'll be a safe zone where kids can talk
about the pressures they are feeling

40:04.434 --> 40:07.070
and get some support
from their peers.

40:07.170 --> 40:10.707
These kids tortured my
daughter for weeks.

40:10.807 --> 40:14.410
They don't need a club.
They need to be punished.

40:14.510 --> 40:19.616
We can't change what's
happened to Dina.

40:19.716 --> 40:24.254
But, maybe we can use it to make a
real difference for someone else.

40:24.354 --> 40:28.324
The administration put you
up to this, didn't they?

40:28.424 --> 40:30.827
They want to distract me.

40:30.927 --> 40:33.296
They want to shut me up,
is what they want to do.

40:33.396 --> 40:35.732
I'm doing this for you, Rachel.

40:35.832 --> 40:39.269
I want to help you. I
want you to trust me.

40:39.369 --> 40:42.372
I did trust you.

40:42.472 --> 40:44.741
I trusted you with my daughter.

41:18.141 --> 41:19.509
Mrs. Van Cleve.

41:19.609 --> 41:22.946
I can not have you continually
harassing my students and faculty.

41:23.046 --> 41:25.949
You have got to be kidding me.
I'm not harassing anybody.

41:26.049 --> 41:28.017
Please stop this witch hunt.

41:28.117 --> 41:30.053
How often do you go into
the girls restroom?

41:30.153 --> 41:31.254
Well, I don't...

41:31.354 --> 41:33.198
You are either completely
incompetent at your job

41:33.222 --> 41:34.624
or you are covering
for these kids.

41:34.724 --> 41:36.292
And honestly, I
can't decide which.

41:36.392 --> 41:38.594
But, either way, I'm not going
to stop asking questions

41:38.695 --> 41:40.039
until I find the answers
I'm looking for.

41:40.063 --> 41:41.731
- Well, I can't help you.
- Yes, I know.

41:41.831 --> 41:43.666
You've made that
abundantly clear.

41:43.766 --> 41:45.568
I'll go over your
head if I have to.

41:45.668 --> 41:47.603
Fine.

41:47.704 --> 41:51.107
Somebody is going to be held
accountable for my daughter's death.

42:17.533 --> 42:19.902
Hi. Hi.

42:20.003 --> 42:21.437
I am so sorry I'm late.

42:21.537 --> 42:22.817
Look, I'll save you the apology.

42:22.872 --> 42:24.841
We decided to go in a
different direction.

42:24.941 --> 42:26.776
A different direction?

42:26.876 --> 42:28.711
We signed with Foster-Healey
this morning.

42:28.811 --> 42:30.413
They're going to represent us.

42:30.513 --> 42:33.783
No, please. I mean, I know
that I've been unavailable...

42:33.883 --> 42:37.186
Frankly, Rachel, no one
will touch the house

42:37.286 --> 42:38.286
if you're selling it.

42:38.354 --> 42:39.922
Who told you that?

42:40.023 --> 42:43.059
Bill's employer wants him
in Atlanta in a month.

42:43.159 --> 42:45.361
We just can't afford to have
this idle on the market.

42:45.461 --> 42:47.163
I'm sorry.

43:19.562 --> 43:21.998
Oh, my God.

43:42.518 --> 43:44.520
You didn't see anything?

43:44.620 --> 43:46.489
No, nothing.

43:46.589 --> 43:49.158
Somebody must have dropped these
off, they don't have postmarks.

43:49.258 --> 43:51.994
Oh... I'm sorry, I
didn't anything.

43:52.095 --> 43:53.896
I've been in and out all day...

43:53.996 --> 43:55.832
There was nothing unusual?

43:55.932 --> 43:59.235
No strange cars...

43:59.335 --> 44:02.805
- Define strange cars?
- I don't know...

44:02.905 --> 44:04.607
- Oh...

44:04.707 --> 44:06.442
Excuse me.

44:07.443 --> 44:08.978
Hello?

44:09.412 --> 44:11.514
What?

44:11.614 --> 44:14.217
No. No, no, no. I'll
be right there.

44:14.317 --> 44:16.252
I have to go.

44:23.693 --> 44:27.263
Oh, no...

44:28.631 --> 44:32.034
No... no...

44:55.491 --> 44:58.227
Who did this?

44:59.662 --> 45:00.897
I don't know.

45:00.997 --> 45:03.199
I don't believe you. Who
are you protecting?

45:03.299 --> 45:06.702
No one. I just came here
to pay my respects.

45:06.802 --> 45:08.304
You don't respect her.

45:08.404 --> 45:10.473
If you did, none of
this would've happened.

45:10.573 --> 45:13.843
Look, you weren't the
only one who lost her...

45:13.943 --> 45:15.478
Who loved her.

45:15.578 --> 45:18.080
If you love her, then you
will tell me the truth.

45:18.181 --> 45:20.483
Did you send the text?

45:20.583 --> 45:23.653
Did you want to seem like a
big man to all your friends?

45:23.753 --> 45:26.189
- No, it wasn't like that.
- Then by all means, Mark.

45:26.289 --> 45:28.496
You tell me what it was
like, because I sure

45:28.508 --> 45:30.726
as hell can't get anybody
else to talk to me.

45:30.826 --> 45:33.296
She sent the text to you.

45:33.396 --> 45:35.298
Who else possibly could
have forwarded it?

45:35.398 --> 45:38.901
I swear, I didn't
forward it to anyone.

45:39.001 --> 45:42.805
You're just a coward.

45:42.905 --> 45:45.174
You're just like
the rest of them.

48:27.303 --> 48:29.405
Hello, Rachel.

48:30.639 --> 48:32.308
I just stopped by to
let you know that

48:32.408 --> 48:34.119
Mark Carey was arrested
at school this morning

48:34.143 --> 48:36.445
for suspected distribution
of child pornography.

48:36.545 --> 48:39.048
Is that really what you wanted?

48:39.148 --> 48:42.618
They've released Mark on
his own recognizance.

48:42.718 --> 48:44.453
Apparently, he swears
he received the text,

48:44.553 --> 48:45.955
but he didn't do
anything with it.

48:46.055 --> 48:47.332
He was too embarrassed for Dina.

48:47.356 --> 48:48.858
He said it was a personal thing.

48:48.958 --> 48:51.160
The text came from his phone.

48:51.260 --> 48:53.529
Even if he didn't do it, don't
you think he knows who did?

48:53.629 --> 48:55.231
I don't know.

48:55.331 --> 48:56.875
The police are still working
on getting the phone records.

48:56.899 --> 48:58.300
Good.

48:58.401 --> 49:00.212
Principal Brannigan and I have
been inundated with calls

49:00.236 --> 49:02.838
from irate parents saying
this has gone way too far.

49:04.006 --> 49:06.442
Is that what this
is actually about?

49:06.542 --> 49:07.810
I don't care.

49:07.910 --> 49:09.979
I don't care about the parents.

49:10.079 --> 49:11.981
All I care about is finding
out what happened,

49:12.081 --> 49:13.258
but these kids are
hiding something.

49:13.282 --> 49:14.817
I know it, and you know it too.

49:14.917 --> 49:16.719
OK. I understand.

49:16.819 --> 49:19.722
But you do understand that even
if somebody deliberately sent

49:19.822 --> 49:23.292
Dina's text viral, you can't
blame them for what Dina did.

49:23.392 --> 49:26.629
She had a choice.

49:31.100 --> 49:33.702
I want the cell phone records.

49:40.109 --> 49:41.644
Claire.

49:42.711 --> 49:44.947
Claire.

49:45.047 --> 49:47.716
I, I can't be seen with you.

49:47.817 --> 49:49.318
What?

49:49.418 --> 49:52.721
Nothing. It's just that I'm
under a lot of pressure.

49:52.822 --> 49:55.791
Claire, please... Please just...

49:55.891 --> 49:57.760
Give me two minutes.

49:59.728 --> 50:02.064
Tell me what happened Homecoming
night after the dance.

50:02.164 --> 50:04.133
What do you mean?

50:04.233 --> 50:06.602
You know that's the night
Dina sent Mark the text.

50:06.702 --> 50:07.770
Yeah, of course.

50:07.870 --> 50:09.805
Well, there had to be a
reason for her to do it.

50:09.905 --> 50:11.273
What?

50:12.975 --> 50:15.478
Oh, Claire. This
is so important.

50:15.578 --> 50:18.514
Was Mark with Skylar at the
after party that night?

50:18.614 --> 50:20.816
I don't know.

50:20.916 --> 50:22.117
What do you mean with...

50:22.218 --> 50:24.253
Did they do anything?

50:24.353 --> 50:26.255
Did they hook up?

50:29.058 --> 50:30.759
♪ When she walked
into the room ♪

50:30.860 --> 50:33.395
♪ I got addicted to
my point of view ♪

50:33.496 --> 50:35.064
- ♪ Now I can't stop - ♪ Hey!

50:35.164 --> 50:36.532
- ♪ And I won't stop - ♪ Hey!

50:36.632 --> 50:40.236
♪ Come back and
show me some more ♪

50:46.275 --> 50:48.377
Claire.

50:48.477 --> 50:52.314
Did Skylar send you that text?

50:52.414 --> 50:55.684
Did she find it on Mark's phone?

50:58.954 --> 51:00.990
Mark, you've got to help me.

51:01.090 --> 51:03.526
They listen to you,
they respect you.

51:03.626 --> 51:06.195
Just, please tell
them this whole thing

51:06.295 --> 51:09.131
is between you and me.
And to just back off.

51:09.231 --> 51:11.200
It's not that simple, Dina.

51:11.300 --> 51:12.535
Yes, it is.

51:12.635 --> 51:15.938
Stop! Come on!

51:16.038 --> 51:18.007
She's really got
you whipped, huh?

51:18.107 --> 51:21.343
Why is Skylar pushing
this so hard?

51:21.443 --> 51:24.013
You know I didn't send
that text, right?

51:24.113 --> 51:25.648
No, Mark. I don't.

51:25.748 --> 51:28.083
I would really like
to believe you,

51:28.183 --> 51:31.987
but by the way that
you're acting,

51:32.087 --> 51:33.389
and hanging out with her,

51:33.489 --> 51:35.424
bragging to your friends...

51:35.524 --> 51:38.694
Oh, if it isn't Dina Van Slut.

51:41.730 --> 51:44.800
You know this is going to
follow you forever, right?

51:47.202 --> 51:49.104
Uh. OK, what?

51:49.204 --> 51:50.382
You know she totally
deserves it.

51:50.406 --> 51:51.707
No, she doesn't.

51:51.807 --> 51:54.176
She sent that picture to
me, not the whole school.

51:54.276 --> 51:56.946
OK, but only one of us was willing
to show you the real thing.

51:57.046 --> 51:58.781
What'd you do? Steal my phone

51:58.881 --> 52:00.516
and send it to the
entire football team?

52:00.616 --> 52:03.218
Mm. Yeah, Mark. That
is exactly what I did.

52:03.319 --> 52:04.863
No, of course not. You
know I wouldn't do that.

52:04.887 --> 52:06.622
Then why do you
hate her so much?

52:06.722 --> 52:10.993
Mark, I sent that
picture to one person.

52:11.093 --> 52:13.929
And so that makes
me the bad guy?

52:15.030 --> 52:17.333
I don't even know why
I'm talking to you.

52:21.537 --> 52:24.907
So, it was Skylar. OK.

52:25.007 --> 52:26.084
What difference does it make?

52:26.108 --> 52:29.011
Makes a lot of difference.

52:29.979 --> 52:31.880
Thank you.

52:54.069 --> 52:57.573
- Hi.
- I need to talk to you.

52:58.674 --> 53:00.509
I need to talk to you too.

53:00.609 --> 53:04.713
I know it wasn't you.

53:13.322 --> 53:15.190
I understand why you
thought it was me.

53:15.290 --> 53:18.794
I'm so sorry.

53:21.330 --> 53:23.899
She had everything
going for her.

53:23.999 --> 53:25.801
Everything.

53:27.503 --> 53:30.673
But, I was just too
stupid to see it.

53:30.773 --> 53:33.842
If I hadn't been
such a jerk to her,

53:33.942 --> 53:36.845
she never would've
sent that picture.

53:36.945 --> 53:38.047
And I...

53:38.147 --> 53:41.684
I feel so guilty.

53:42.851 --> 53:45.888
It all just, spiraled
out of control, but...

53:48.957 --> 53:51.927
It started with me.

53:54.229 --> 53:56.999
You have no idea how
vicious it was.

53:58.100 --> 53:59.301
How can kids...

53:59.401 --> 54:03.739
How can we be so
brutal to each other?

54:07.843 --> 54:11.480
I want you to know that I didn't
send that picture to anyone.

54:11.580 --> 54:13.015
- I know.
- I didn't.

54:13.115 --> 54:14.983
I know.

54:16.852 --> 54:19.722
But, I saw what it
was doing to her.

54:21.423 --> 54:23.358
And I didn't do a
thing to stop it.

54:23.459 --> 54:25.294
It's OK.

54:25.394 --> 54:26.528
- It's OK.
- I'm sorry.

54:26.628 --> 54:29.698
- I know.
- I'm sorry.

54:39.942 --> 54:42.711
It's still tough
seeing him, huh?

54:43.078 --> 54:44.446
What?

54:44.546 --> 54:47.583
Oh, yeah...

54:49.551 --> 54:51.086
I'm sorry.

54:53.455 --> 54:55.357
Well, I'll tell you this...

54:55.457 --> 54:58.460
it's his loss, and I mean that.

54:59.762 --> 55:01.830
Hey.

55:01.930 --> 55:04.700
You're on to bigger
and better things.

55:06.135 --> 55:07.936
Try and focus on that, OK?

55:08.036 --> 55:10.472
Sure.

55:12.441 --> 55:15.144
I love you.

55:17.980 --> 55:19.782
Love you, too.

55:21.817 --> 55:24.186
- Bye, Mom.
- Bye, sweetie.

55:37.399 --> 55:40.669
Slut.

56:17.372 --> 56:19.608
She was cutting class.

56:19.708 --> 56:21.643
Her grades were slipping.

56:21.743 --> 56:23.879
She was even missing practice.

56:23.979 --> 56:28.917
I couldn't believe she was
skipping field hockey practice.

56:29.017 --> 56:32.120
She loved that game
more than anything.

56:35.157 --> 56:38.126
- Where's Dina?
- Does it really matter?

56:38.227 --> 56:39.904
It's not like she's been
a real part of this team

56:39.928 --> 56:42.130
since she sent that whole
porno around the school.

56:42.231 --> 56:44.466
Don't you think you're being
a little hard on her?

56:44.566 --> 56:46.768
It's been, like, three weeks.

56:46.869 --> 56:49.671
Maybe we should just lay
off her for awhile.

56:49.771 --> 56:51.573
What? No!

56:51.673 --> 56:53.041
She totally deserves it.

56:53.141 --> 56:55.544
She broke the first
rule of sexting.

56:55.644 --> 56:57.346
Don't show your face.

56:57.446 --> 57:03.051
It's always neck down, knees
up, no birth marks. Duh.

57:03.151 --> 57:04.419
I guess.

57:04.519 --> 57:08.390
I don't know, I just thought
maybe she's been through enough.

57:08.490 --> 57:11.560
Yeah, but did you also know
that if we go to playoffs

57:11.660 --> 57:13.962
with Dina Van Cleve
on our roster,

57:14.062 --> 57:17.199
and that picture gets her
punted from the team

57:17.299 --> 57:19.067
our whole season's at jeopardy.

57:19.167 --> 57:21.770
They can disqualify us.

57:22.538 --> 57:23.839
They can do that?

57:23.939 --> 57:26.775
God, yes Claire.
They can do that.

57:26.875 --> 57:28.944
It's like she doesn't even care.

57:29.044 --> 57:33.148
So someone should
really tell Coach.

57:33.248 --> 57:35.851
I can't show her that picture.
I'll get in trouble.

57:35.951 --> 57:39.254
But, you still
have that picture?

57:39.354 --> 57:43.225
I mean, I figured some Freshman
boys had it to perv on,

57:43.325 --> 57:46.662
but really? I deleted
that like after a day.

57:46.762 --> 57:49.831
- Yeah, I deleted it too.
- Whatever.

57:49.932 --> 57:51.476
It's not like you even
have to show her.

57:51.500 --> 57:54.870
Just tip her off. It's
not that hard to find.

57:54.970 --> 57:57.205
Well, why don't you do it?

57:57.306 --> 58:01.677
Because, Claire, Dina beat
me out for All Stars.

58:01.777 --> 58:04.947
If I did it, it'd look
like sour grapes.

58:05.047 --> 58:08.784
But, if you did, it's
just civic duty.

58:10.285 --> 58:12.454
I don't know.

58:12.554 --> 58:14.022
Life lesson, Claire:

58:14.122 --> 58:16.024
We are the company we keep.

58:16.124 --> 58:21.363
And if you want to walk this world
with the likes of Dina Van Cleve?

58:21.463 --> 58:22.831
That's fine.

58:22.931 --> 58:27.102
But remember, it'll be
your social suicide.

58:38.347 --> 58:41.283
I wish I could take everything
that happened back.

58:41.383 --> 58:44.119
I never meant to hurt her.

58:45.754 --> 58:47.189
I want you to listen to me.

58:47.289 --> 58:53.261
You are not responsible for
what happened to Dina.

58:55.497 --> 58:58.600
And, I want to thank you,
from the bottom of my heart.

58:58.700 --> 59:01.937
Being honest with me.

59:03.739 --> 59:05.907
You're the only
one who has been.

59:18.754 --> 59:22.090
Do you think I'm doing
the right thing?

59:22.190 --> 59:25.360
What? In mourning the
death of your child?

59:25.460 --> 59:28.830
Of course.

59:30.632 --> 59:32.334
No, I mean in a larger sense.

59:32.434 --> 59:34.269
Do you think I'm...

59:34.369 --> 59:37.939
Do you think I'm
pushing too hard?

59:39.174 --> 59:42.544
Well... maybe.

59:42.644 --> 59:45.047
I don't know. I...

59:45.147 --> 59:49.484
You know, everybody has to deal
with these things in their own way.

59:51.286 --> 59:54.356
Sometimes I really feel
like I'm going to be OK.

59:55.357 --> 59:57.492
And then...

59:57.592 --> 59:59.061
I will see something,

59:59.161 --> 01:00:03.732
and it will remind
me so much of her.

01:00:03.832 --> 01:00:06.368
That this...

01:00:06.468 --> 01:00:10.038
wave just comes over me.

01:00:10.138 --> 01:00:14.209
And... And I seize up.

01:00:17.712 --> 01:00:19.881
Oh, God sometimes I
feel like the only way

01:00:19.981 --> 01:00:23.985
that I can keep moving,
is if I, um...

01:00:24.086 --> 01:00:26.354
if I have a purpose.

01:00:27.823 --> 01:00:30.492
It's why I had to find
out who did this?

01:00:32.127 --> 01:00:34.196
I'm going to make
us some more tea.

01:00:34.296 --> 01:00:35.964
Yeah?

01:00:38.133 --> 01:00:40.969
I know it was Skylar.

01:00:42.637 --> 01:00:44.106
Excuse me?

01:00:44.206 --> 01:00:47.809
I know it was Skylar
who sent the text.

01:00:51.746 --> 01:00:53.815
That's ridiculous. Why
would Skylar do that?

01:00:53.915 --> 01:00:56.051
Because she was jealous of her.

01:00:56.151 --> 01:00:58.920
Patty, she's been jealous of her
since the day she was born.

01:00:59.020 --> 01:01:02.424
- No, she's not.
- Yes.

01:01:02.524 --> 01:01:04.893
She's not. Who told you this?

01:01:04.993 --> 01:01:08.263
One of the kids told
me in confidence.

01:01:08.363 --> 01:01:11.433
- And you believed them?
- Yes, I believed them, Patty.

01:01:11.533 --> 01:01:13.568
They had no reason to lie to me.

01:01:13.668 --> 01:01:15.670
OK...

01:01:15.770 --> 01:01:18.140
Skylar?

01:01:18.240 --> 01:01:22.277
Honey, would you come
down here for a second?

01:01:24.713 --> 01:01:25.947
Yeah, Mom?

01:01:26.047 --> 01:01:29.084
Did you send that text
of Dina to anyone?

01:01:29.184 --> 01:01:32.187
No, of course not.

01:01:32.287 --> 01:01:33.989
But, you did receive it?

01:01:34.089 --> 01:01:35.790
Well, yeah.

01:01:35.891 --> 01:01:39.361
But, everyone did eventually.

01:01:39.461 --> 01:01:40.896
Mrs. Van Cleve?

01:01:40.996 --> 01:01:45.233
I swear, I would've never
done that to Dina.

01:01:46.868 --> 01:01:48.503
Thank you, sweetie.

01:01:48.603 --> 01:01:50.539
Sure.

01:02:01.383 --> 01:02:03.351
I'd like to see her
phone, please.

01:02:03.451 --> 01:02:05.153
Oh...

01:02:05.253 --> 01:02:07.489
Rachel, you're crossing
the line here.

01:02:07.589 --> 01:02:10.959
We have 17 years of friendship.

01:02:11.059 --> 01:02:14.029
I deserve your trust, I
think I've earned it.

01:02:14.129 --> 01:02:16.865
I don't know who told
you that Skylar did it,

01:02:16.965 --> 01:02:21.436
but I promise you,
they're mistaken.

01:02:21.536 --> 01:02:24.673
Oh, sweetie...

01:02:24.773 --> 01:02:27.642
- I'm sorry.
- Oh...

01:02:27.742 --> 01:02:30.879
I just miss her so much.

01:02:30.979 --> 01:02:33.381
Oh, God.

01:02:33.481 --> 01:02:35.617
You need something much
stronger than tea.

01:02:35.717 --> 01:02:37.953
OK?

01:02:38.053 --> 01:02:39.454
Let me go get us something.

01:02:39.554 --> 01:02:42.424
- Yes, yes.
- OK.

01:02:42.524 --> 01:02:44.059
I'll be right back.

01:02:44.159 --> 01:02:46.595
Oh, God. I'll have a double.

01:02:46.695 --> 01:02:49.231
I'm gonna...

01:02:49.331 --> 01:02:51.466
I'm gonna go use your bathroom.

01:02:51.566 --> 01:02:53.602
- OK.
- OK.

01:03:52.160 --> 01:03:54.262
She thinks it was me.

01:03:54.362 --> 01:03:56.298
If Mark got arrested
then I'm gonna be next.

01:03:56.398 --> 01:03:59.200
Sweetheart, calm down. She
doesn't have anything,

01:03:59.301 --> 01:04:01.336
it's just some baseless
finger pointing.

01:04:01.436 --> 01:04:04.105
But, pointing leads to looking.

01:04:04.205 --> 01:04:05.974
Yeah, but what's she gonna find?

01:04:06.074 --> 01:04:09.144
You didn't send that
text out to anyone.

01:04:09.244 --> 01:04:10.745
No.

01:04:10.845 --> 01:04:12.147
Except for one person. I...

01:04:12.247 --> 01:04:14.282
- Sky!
- It's just Claire!

01:04:14.382 --> 01:04:18.887
I... I just didn't want her thinking Dina
was the saint everyone thought she was.

01:04:18.987 --> 01:04:22.190
Does that mean I'm
gonna get in trouble?

01:04:22.290 --> 01:04:25.360
It breaks our heart,
what happened to Dina.

01:04:25.460 --> 01:04:28.830
But, you didn't put that scarf
around her neck. Did you?

01:04:28.930 --> 01:04:31.399
Mom... Of course not.

01:04:31.499 --> 01:04:35.503
Of course not. Of course not.

01:04:35.603 --> 01:04:40.075
Then there's nothing
to worry about. OK?

01:04:40.175 --> 01:04:42.377
Go grab those cookies.
Meet me in the kitchen.

01:04:42.477 --> 01:04:44.145
Come on.

01:04:49.784 --> 01:04:52.921
I'd like to drop the charges
against Mark Carey.

01:04:53.021 --> 01:04:54.656
I think that's a wise decision.

01:04:54.756 --> 01:04:57.559
After all, he's a bright young man
with a very promising future.

01:04:57.659 --> 01:05:00.995
Because, I now firmly believe it was
Skylar Reid who instigated the bullying.

01:05:01.096 --> 01:05:04.566
Rachel, why can't
you let this go?

01:05:04.666 --> 01:05:06.644
I found a stack of magazines
in the Reid's bathroom

01:05:06.668 --> 01:05:08.646
with cut out letters that
look exactly like the ones

01:05:08.670 --> 01:05:10.839
- on the threats I received.
- That's hardly proof.

01:05:10.939 --> 01:05:13.017
Well, maybe not. But once we
get the cell phone records,

01:05:13.041 --> 01:05:15.319
I guarantee we're going to see it's
Skylar who sent around that text.

01:05:15.343 --> 01:05:17.946
Rachel, we did. She only
sent it to one person.

01:05:18.046 --> 01:05:22.117
- Who?
- Claire Stevens.

01:05:22.217 --> 01:05:24.919
And then on Sunday afternoon

01:05:25.019 --> 01:05:29.057
Claire broadcast the text to
about 40 different numbers.

01:05:29.157 --> 01:05:30.835
We don't know who all the
recipients were yet,

01:05:30.859 --> 01:05:35.730
but we do know it was Claire
who made the sext go viral.

01:05:54.215 --> 01:05:56.518
I've heard people say that...

01:05:56.618 --> 01:05:58.720
when you hit rock bottom

01:05:58.820 --> 01:06:01.823
there's no where
else to go but up.

01:06:10.265 --> 01:06:13.902
I've heard people say that...

01:06:14.002 --> 01:06:15.813
- when you hit rock bottom...
- How could you do it?

01:06:15.837 --> 01:06:18.072
There's no where
else to go but up.

01:06:18.173 --> 01:06:21.743
I should call the
police right now.

01:06:21.843 --> 01:06:27.248
And like everyday, I
wake up and I just...

01:06:27.348 --> 01:06:30.718
sink lower

01:06:30.819 --> 01:06:33.221
and lower then I ever

01:06:33.321 --> 01:06:36.324
thought possible.

01:06:37.759 --> 01:06:40.028
Jesus...

01:06:40.128 --> 01:06:41.763
Today...

01:06:41.863 --> 01:06:45.567
I don't really know
what to say...

01:06:47.268 --> 01:06:53.608
Today, I got kicked off
the field hockey team.

01:06:54.843 --> 01:06:59.214
And my scholarship offer
to Price is gone.

01:07:05.987 --> 01:07:07.422
- Dina?
- Yeah?

01:07:07.522 --> 01:07:09.724
- Do you have a minute?
- Yeah.

01:07:11.125 --> 01:07:14.028
I saw the picture.

01:07:14.128 --> 01:07:17.732
And I have no choice but to
ask you to leave the team.

01:07:17.832 --> 01:07:22.403
And it breaks my heart because
I am required by NCAA rules,

01:07:22.504 --> 01:07:24.806
to report this to Price as well.

01:07:24.906 --> 01:07:27.408
I'm so sorry.

01:07:27.509 --> 01:07:30.044
I know this was just some
harmless little thing

01:07:30.144 --> 01:07:32.046
between you and your boyfriend.

01:07:32.146 --> 01:07:36.251
But, unfortunately it has
enormous consequences.

01:07:36.351 --> 01:07:39.454
I'm so sorry.

01:07:39.554 --> 01:07:41.523
If you want to talk about it,

01:07:41.623 --> 01:07:44.292
my door is always open, Dina.

01:07:59.607 --> 01:08:01.976
I didn't know you still
went to this school.

01:08:04.145 --> 01:08:06.948
Oh, um... Dina, I
forgot to ask you,

01:08:07.048 --> 01:08:10.018
how was All Star camp? You
know, my friend Sarah said

01:08:10.118 --> 01:08:12.220
that you made quite
the impression.

01:08:12.320 --> 01:08:15.623
What a waste, right?

01:08:15.723 --> 01:08:18.426
Man, those scouts must've
been really impressed.

01:08:18.526 --> 01:08:21.129
You know, with your tits.

01:08:21.229 --> 01:08:24.465
You are such a bitch.

01:08:26.067 --> 01:08:28.836
Yeah, it's better then a slut.

01:08:28.937 --> 01:08:30.772
Oh, my God!

01:08:36.911 --> 01:08:39.714
- Dina!
- What? If you hated me that much,

01:08:39.814 --> 01:08:42.884
I'm surprised it took you
that long to run to Coach.

01:08:42.984 --> 01:08:44.484
What are you talking about?

01:08:44.586 --> 01:08:46.955
I'm off the team.

01:08:47.055 --> 01:08:48.323
Don't pretend you didn't know.

01:08:48.423 --> 01:08:49.756
I didn't know, OK?

01:08:49.857 --> 01:08:52.060
I also didn't know she
had it in her, wow.

01:08:52.160 --> 01:08:53.328
What?

01:08:53.428 --> 01:08:56.497
I didn't narc you out.
Claire did.

01:08:56.598 --> 01:08:59.267
- Shut up.
- Yeah.

01:08:59.367 --> 01:09:01.970
Because you guys are so close.

01:09:03.004 --> 01:09:06.640
- What's going on?
- Is it true?

01:09:07.709 --> 01:09:09.344
What?

01:09:11.446 --> 01:09:13.948
How could you do that to me?

01:09:14.048 --> 01:09:15.582
What are you talking about?

01:09:15.683 --> 01:09:18.953
You know what I'm talking about!
You stabbed me in the back!

01:09:19.053 --> 01:09:20.587
For what, huh?

01:09:20.688 --> 01:09:25.526
In some sad, misguided hope
that people would talk to you,

01:09:25.627 --> 01:09:27.362
and not about you?

01:09:28.296 --> 01:09:29.663
That they would like you?

01:09:29.764 --> 01:09:32.367
When, newsflash. They won't.

01:09:33.468 --> 01:09:36.804
You are so spineless.

01:09:36.904 --> 01:09:41.242
She ratted you out, so
she's not so spineless.

01:09:41.341 --> 01:09:45.078
Yeah, I'm not so spineless.

01:09:48.883 --> 01:09:54.589
And I just feel like,
everything that I loved and...

01:09:54.689 --> 01:09:58.426
And my escape and my
future is just gone.

01:09:58.526 --> 01:10:02.697
And for what? You know?

01:10:02.797 --> 01:10:08.302
Because I, I sent some stupid
picture to my boyfriend?

01:10:08.403 --> 01:10:11.706
No, it's not... It's
because my best friend

01:10:11.806 --> 01:10:14.509
decided to throw
me under the bus.

01:10:14.609 --> 01:10:18.279
Claire,

01:10:18.379 --> 01:10:21.449
I wish I could see your face

01:10:21.549 --> 01:10:25.019
when you flip to the
end of this story.

01:10:28.523 --> 01:10:30.591
I'm done.

01:10:32.760 --> 01:10:36.597
Just... so done.

01:10:42.770 --> 01:10:47.041
I hate myself for what I did.

01:10:47.141 --> 01:10:51.279
I just, I wanted
Skylar to like me.

01:10:51.379 --> 01:10:54.382
I didn't want the team
to be disqualified.

01:10:54.482 --> 01:10:57.518
I never got to apologize.

01:10:57.618 --> 01:11:01.089
I can't believe I didn't
help her, I just...

01:11:01.189 --> 01:11:03.858
I was so scared.

01:11:04.992 --> 01:11:07.662
The last time I saw her,

01:11:07.762 --> 01:11:10.364
the way I treated her,

01:11:10.465 --> 01:11:15.103
God, I really am spineless.

01:11:17.505 --> 01:11:20.174
I am so sorry.

01:11:20.274 --> 01:11:24.545
I'm so sorry that you lost
your daughter because I...

01:11:24.645 --> 01:11:28.049
don't know how to
stand up to people.

01:11:33.087 --> 01:11:37.925
How could you send that
to so many people?

01:11:39.794 --> 01:11:42.864
I didn't Mrs. V, I
wouldn't do that.

01:11:42.964 --> 01:11:45.700
After the dance, I forgot
my phone in the limo

01:11:45.800 --> 01:11:48.703
and then the company dropped
it off at Skylar's house

01:11:48.803 --> 01:11:50.605
and I went to pick
it up the next day.

01:11:50.705 --> 01:11:53.708
That's why I thought that
it was Skylar all along.

01:11:53.808 --> 01:11:56.911
You went to the Reid's house?

01:11:59.781 --> 01:12:01.349
- Mrs. Reid?
- Yeah?

01:12:01.449 --> 01:12:02.860
I found this phone in
the back of my limo

01:12:02.884 --> 01:12:04.385
when I was cleaning
up this morning.

01:12:04.485 --> 01:12:06.354
It was wedged between
one of the seats.

01:12:06.454 --> 01:12:07.922
Those kids left quite a mess.

01:12:08.022 --> 01:12:09.824
- Oh, I'm sorry about that.
- No problem.

01:12:09.924 --> 01:12:11.526
- I'm used to it.
- OK.

01:12:11.626 --> 01:12:13.261
- Have a nice day.
- Thanks.

01:12:13.361 --> 01:12:14.962
Bye.

01:12:17.532 --> 01:12:20.401
Patricia...

01:12:20.501 --> 01:12:23.538
Oh, God...

01:12:31.245 --> 01:12:32.613
Is that you, honey?

01:12:32.713 --> 01:12:35.049
Hurry up, we gotta go
meet your dad for dinner.

01:12:35.149 --> 01:12:38.786
Tonight? Ugh... I'm
so not up for that.

01:12:38.886 --> 01:12:41.589
I know, but at least he's
not bringing the wife.

01:12:41.689 --> 01:12:44.125
So, come on. Put
on something nice.

01:12:45.693 --> 01:12:47.695
Mom? Your phone's ringing.

01:12:47.795 --> 01:12:50.898
Must be Dad, saying
he's late as usual.

01:12:50.998 --> 01:12:53.234
Just let it go to voice mail.

01:12:53.334 --> 01:12:55.002
I'll call him back.

01:12:55.102 --> 01:12:57.205
I'll just text him.

01:12:59.841 --> 01:13:01.642
Claire?

01:13:10.551 --> 01:13:12.520
I saw it.

01:13:12.620 --> 01:13:15.556
I saw Dina's picture
on your phone.

01:13:15.656 --> 01:13:18.759
Oh, my God, what did you do?

01:13:19.894 --> 01:13:21.796
What are you talking about?

01:13:21.896 --> 01:13:25.032
- You sent it out?
- No.

01:13:25.132 --> 01:13:29.470
Claire sent it out. They
have the phone records.

01:13:29.570 --> 01:13:31.806
But, you had Claire's phone.

01:13:31.906 --> 01:13:35.610
So, what did you do? Send
yourself one for a souvenir?

01:13:35.710 --> 01:13:39.714
I did it for you.

01:13:39.814 --> 01:13:42.383
- No...
- Dina made you so unhappy.

01:13:42.483 --> 01:13:46.387
And she took so much from you.

01:13:46.487 --> 01:13:49.390
You wouldn't have gotten
that scholarship otherwise.

01:13:49.490 --> 01:13:52.326
Mom! That was her scholarship.

01:13:52.426 --> 01:13:55.363
She was the great athlete,
she was the honor student.

01:13:55.463 --> 01:13:57.698
She deserved it.

01:14:00.268 --> 01:14:03.437
You trashed her grave.

01:14:03.538 --> 01:14:05.840
And the brick? It was all you!

01:14:05.940 --> 01:14:10.478
You'll understand when you
have children of your own.

01:14:10.578 --> 01:14:14.682
Skylar... I love you so much,

01:14:14.782 --> 01:14:17.585
I would do anything for you.

01:14:17.685 --> 01:14:19.553
Anything.

01:14:19.654 --> 01:14:21.956
I may have teased her,
but I would've never

01:14:22.056 --> 01:14:23.691
wanted her to kill herself.

01:14:23.791 --> 01:14:26.360
OK. Listen to me.

01:14:26.460 --> 01:14:29.797
It was just a harmless prank.

01:14:29.897 --> 01:14:32.333
I had no idea Dina
was that unhinged.

01:14:32.433 --> 01:14:37.505
But, but she killed herself. Not us.
Our hands are clean.

01:14:37.605 --> 01:14:40.308
Mom, no they're not. And
they never will be.

01:14:40.408 --> 01:14:42.476
Skylar! Honey, Skylar?

01:14:42.576 --> 01:14:45.479
- Where are you going?
- Away from you!

01:14:45.579 --> 01:14:48.382
Sky... Skylar!

01:14:51.218 --> 01:14:52.887
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

01:14:58.059 --> 01:14:59.360
Delete.

01:15:19.180 --> 01:15:20.614
Patricia Reid?

01:15:20.715 --> 01:15:23.584
Officer, my daughter just took off
in my car. And she's very upset.

01:15:23.684 --> 01:15:27.355
You are under arrest for the suspected
dissemination of child pornography.

01:15:27.455 --> 01:15:30.324
I need you to come with
me down to the station.

01:16:44.165 --> 01:16:47.068
Is she going to be all right?

01:16:50.871 --> 01:16:53.941
Did you come here to gloat?

01:16:56.710 --> 01:16:58.312
No.

01:17:00.114 --> 01:17:03.017
I came to say that I'm sorry.

01:17:05.386 --> 01:17:08.622
I'm so sorry that you're
now going through the pain

01:17:08.723 --> 01:17:11.058
that I'm going through.

01:17:12.526 --> 01:17:15.296
If anybody on the earth
knows what it feels like,

01:17:15.396 --> 01:17:17.832
it's me.

01:17:17.932 --> 01:17:21.502
And I wouldn't wish that kind
of pain on my worst enemy.

01:17:23.904 --> 01:17:27.508
And, I wanted to say that...

01:17:30.277 --> 01:17:32.947
I'm sorry...

01:17:35.983 --> 01:17:41.021
that you found my
daughter so threatening.

01:17:43.324 --> 01:17:45.025
I don't know what
it could've been

01:17:45.126 --> 01:17:48.529
about my sweet Dina that
threatened you so much.

01:17:50.164 --> 01:17:52.833
But, I'm so sorry that
you felt that way.

01:17:56.070 --> 01:17:59.006
And, lastly...

01:17:59.106 --> 01:18:03.010
I'm sorry that our
friendship wasn't real.

01:18:09.617 --> 01:18:13.187
I hope that Skylar's OK, Patty.

01:18:13.287 --> 01:18:16.157
And I'll pray for that
sweet girl every night.

01:18:19.994 --> 01:18:22.429
But, I will see you in court.

01:18:44.785 --> 01:18:47.521
Someone once told me
that common sufferings

01:18:47.621 --> 01:18:50.424
are far stronger bond
than common joys.

01:18:50.524 --> 01:18:52.893
If that's the case then

01:18:52.993 --> 01:18:56.664
Patricia and I are
closer than ever.

01:18:56.764 --> 01:18:58.232
Dina's still gone.

01:18:58.332 --> 01:19:03.637
And Skylar may never walk again.

01:19:03.737 --> 01:19:09.376
I guess, ultimately, I thought I
might find some peace in all this.

01:19:10.678 --> 01:19:14.882
Or, at least, I hoped I would.

01:19:16.283 --> 01:19:18.361
I just wanted to understand
what my daughter went through.

01:19:18.385 --> 01:19:23.557
And I wanted other people
to understand it, too.

01:19:23.657 --> 01:19:26.093
But, now that it's over...

01:19:26.193 --> 01:19:30.197
honestly, I just wish I knew I
made any difference at all.

01:19:35.636 --> 01:19:38.405
- Mrs. V?
- Hey, come in.

01:19:38.505 --> 01:19:39.740
Hi.

01:19:39.840 --> 01:19:41.508
How are you?

01:19:42.843 --> 01:19:44.311
I'm OK.

01:19:44.411 --> 01:19:48.015
- How are you?
- I'm OK, too.

01:19:48.115 --> 01:19:52.987
Um... I actually kind of
have a surprise for you.

01:19:53.087 --> 01:19:55.890
Would you come with me?
To the school?

01:19:55.990 --> 01:19:58.993
Do you need me to
go to the school?

01:19:59.093 --> 01:20:02.429
Can you just trust me on this?

01:20:04.064 --> 01:20:06.166
I trust you.

01:20:22.816 --> 01:20:25.753
What is this?

01:20:25.853 --> 01:20:27.988
You'll see.

01:20:51.845 --> 01:20:53.447
Please have a seat.

01:21:00.421 --> 01:21:03.090
I'm really glad you came.

01:21:12.766 --> 01:21:15.602
Thank you all for
being here today.

01:21:17.204 --> 01:21:19.973
As we all know, this
has been a fall

01:21:20.074 --> 01:21:23.877
full of tragedy
here at Westfield.

01:21:23.978 --> 01:21:27.214
We have lost a...

01:21:27.314 --> 01:21:30.351
We have lost a member
of our Senior class.

01:21:32.586 --> 01:21:37.324
It's easy to say that Dina was
responsible for her own death.

01:21:37.424 --> 01:21:41.128
But, I think we all
know the truth.

01:21:41.228 --> 01:21:44.398
Bullying is poisonous.

01:21:44.498 --> 01:21:50.371
It pervades our schools and our
society in horrifying ways.

01:21:50.471 --> 01:21:55.142
And today, with the anonymous
communication we have via technology,

01:21:55.242 --> 01:21:58.379
it makes bullying
that much easier.

01:21:58.479 --> 01:22:00.180
I'm going to say it right now,

01:22:00.280 --> 01:22:02.683
and no one in this
room can deny it.

01:22:02.783 --> 01:22:06.253
Dina Van Cleve was
bullied to death.

01:22:06.353 --> 01:22:08.989
She was not responsible.

01:22:09.089 --> 01:22:11.658
Everyone in this
room is responsible.

01:22:11.759 --> 01:22:15.696
Everyone who saw the
text and passed it on.

01:22:15.796 --> 01:22:17.364
Everyone who called her names,

01:22:17.464 --> 01:22:23.670
everyone who giggled when
she passed in the halls.

01:22:23.771 --> 01:22:27.608
Everyone who didn't do
everything in their power

01:22:27.708 --> 01:22:31.979
to stop the cruelty that
Dina had to endure.

01:22:32.079 --> 01:22:34.681
And I'm as guilty
as the rest of you.

01:22:34.782 --> 01:22:40.487
Maybe even more so, because
I was Dina's best friend.

01:22:44.391 --> 01:22:49.396
What I am proposing here
today maybe a small gesture,

01:22:49.496 --> 01:22:53.200
but I think the statement
it makes will be huge.

01:22:53.300 --> 01:22:56.136
I want each and every one of us

01:22:56.236 --> 01:22:58.972
to take responsibility
for this tragedy.

01:22:59.072 --> 01:23:00.808
And pledge to give
up our cell phones

01:23:00.908 --> 01:23:03.177
for the rest of the semester.

01:23:23.430 --> 01:23:25.499
Thank you.

01:24:53.220 --> 01:24:55.656
All right, so this
is my response

01:24:55.756 --> 01:24:57.791
to the "what is happiness" tag.

01:24:57.891 --> 01:25:00.703
I know I should take more time to think
about the good things in my life.

01:25:00.727 --> 01:25:03.697
So, this seemed like
the perfect excuse.

01:25:03.797 --> 01:25:05.165
All right.

01:25:05.265 --> 01:25:07.701
So, things that make me happy...

01:25:07.801 --> 01:25:13.874
- Uh... Christmas movies in August.
- Yes!

01:25:13.974 --> 01:25:15.375
Ahh, Gerbera Daisies.

01:25:15.475 --> 01:25:17.211
- Pink ones.
- Pink ones.

01:25:17.311 --> 01:25:19.246
My Dazzleglass lip gloss.

01:25:19.346 --> 01:25:21.586
You mean the one you borrowed
from me and never gave back?

01:25:21.648 --> 01:25:24.785
Uh-huh...

01:25:24.885 --> 01:25:27.187
Claire's Dazzleglass lip gloss.

01:25:27.287 --> 01:25:29.556
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

01:25:29.656 --> 01:25:31.091
Uh...

01:25:31.191 --> 01:25:33.660
Nnn... You made me lose
my train of thought.

01:25:33.760 --> 01:25:34.895
OK, um...

01:25:34.995 --> 01:25:37.197
Things that make me happy are...

01:25:37.297 --> 01:25:40.534
- Her boyfriend.
- Very happy.

01:25:40.634 --> 01:25:42.169
Ooh, care to elaborate?

01:25:42.269 --> 01:25:43.637
On the Internet?

01:25:43.737 --> 01:25:47.741
Um, my friends make me happy.

01:25:47.841 --> 01:25:50.310
Why do I rate below
Gerbera Daisies?

01:25:50.410 --> 01:25:52.846
Girl, it's in no
particular order.

01:25:52.946 --> 01:25:55.048
All right.

01:25:55.148 --> 01:25:56.617
My friends make me happy.

01:25:56.717 --> 01:25:59.453
- Usually.
- Hey!

01:25:59.553 --> 01:26:00.921
Dina, we're leaving in five.

01:26:01.021 --> 01:26:02.356
OK!

01:26:02.456 --> 01:26:05.492
Uh... And, my mom.

01:26:05.592 --> 01:26:08.028
She makes me happy.

01:26:08.128 --> 01:26:09.830
So, that's my list.

01:26:09.930 --> 01:26:14.034
