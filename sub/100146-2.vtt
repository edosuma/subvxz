WEBVTT

00:00.100 --> 00:01.530
PREVIOUSLY ON "ALL AMERICAN"...

00:01.630 --> 00:02.770
SPENCER JAMES?

00:02.770 --> 00:04.270
BILLY BAKER,
VARSITY COACH,

00:04.270 --> 00:07.270
BEVERLY HIGH.
I NEED YOU TO COME PLAY FOR ME.

00:07.270 --> 00:09.240
HEY, CHEERS, BABY!

00:09.240 --> 00:11.510
ASHER: BRO, YOU ALMOST
MISSED THE WHOLE
CELEBRATION HERE.

00:11.510 --> 00:14.180
I HOPE YOUR DAD
IS ENJOYING HIS
WELL-EARNED VACATION.

00:14.180 --> 00:16.310
I HAD AN AFFAIR
WITH GRACE JAMES.

00:16.310 --> 00:17.950
GRACE: THIS IS
THE LAST TIME I'M COMING
TO GET YOU LIKE THIS.

00:17.950 --> 00:20.920
-I MISS THEM, GRACIE.
-WELL, THEN BOSS UP.

00:20.920 --> 00:22.520
ARE YOU READY TO
FINALLY TELL ME THE TRUTH?

00:22.520 --> 00:24.320
WHAT ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT?

00:24.320 --> 00:25.790
OLIVIA: ONE MINUTE YOU'RE
DESTROYING YOUR HOUSE

00:25.790 --> 00:27.290
AND THE NEXT, YOU'RE ALL
FOOTBALL BARBIE ON CRACK.

00:27.290 --> 00:29.260
LAYLA: I PROMISE YOU,
I DON'T NEED SAVING.

00:29.260 --> 00:30.860
WHY ARE YOU WASTING YOUR TIME?
'CAUSE I'M PRETTY SURE

00:30.860 --> 00:33.300
YOU COULD BE GIVING DRAKE
A RUN FOR HIS MONEY.

00:33.300 --> 00:35.530
JANELLE: I DON'T WANT
YOU HANGING AROUND THAT
PATIENCE GIRL ANYMORE.

00:35.530 --> 00:37.300
MOM, I AM GAY.

00:37.300 --> 00:39.600
SPENCER: SO YOU'RE
QUITTING ON THE TEAM?

00:39.600 --> 00:42.610
-I'M PRIORITIZING.
-NAW, MAN, YOU'RE
PUNISHING YOURSELF.

00:42.610 --> 00:44.840
BOY: LOOK AT THE OLD MAN.

00:44.840 --> 00:47.810
MAN, THANKS FOR
CONVINCING MOMS TO LET
ME COME STAY WITH YOU.

01:53.340 --> 01:54.980
MORNING.

01:54.980 --> 01:56.980
HIYA, SPENCER.
GOOD MORNING.

01:56.980 --> 01:59.620
WHAT CAN I GET YOU?
EGGS? PANCAKES?

01:59.620 --> 02:00.920
I'M GOOD, MRS. BAKER.
THANK YOU, THOUGH.

02:00.920 --> 02:03.750
WELL, AT LEAST LET ME...

02:03.750 --> 02:06.490
TREAT YOU GUYS
TO SOME LUNCH.

02:06.490 --> 02:08.930
GOT TO GET READY FOR WORK.

02:08.930 --> 02:12.130
YOU TWO HAVE A REALLY
GOOD DAY AT SCHOOL.

02:14.260 --> 02:16.400
HOW LONG YOU THINK SHE'S
GONNA KEEP THAT UP?

02:16.400 --> 02:18.230
WHAT,
BUYING US LUNCH?

02:18.230 --> 02:19.800
YEAH, HER WHOLE
FAIRY GODMOTHER ACT.

02:19.800 --> 02:22.240
EVER SINCE MY DAD MOVED OUT,
IT'S LIKE SHE'S BEEN TRYING

02:22.240 --> 02:24.370
WAY TOO HARD TO MAKE
OUR LIVES SEEM NORMAL.

02:24.370 --> 02:26.640
AIN'T NOTHING NORMAL
ABOUT THIS.

02:37.790 --> 02:40.260
YOU OK?

02:42.290 --> 02:44.790
THAT'S MY WAY
OF SAYING, "I KNOW
YOU'RE NOT OK."

02:44.790 --> 02:47.800
YEAH, JUST SOME STUFF
GOING ON WITH MY POPS.

02:47.800 --> 02:50.430
WELL, I KNOW THAT MUCH BY
THE WAY YOU'VE BEEN GIVING
HIS CALLS THE HEISMAN.

02:52.200 --> 02:55.610
HE WANTS ME TO COME PLAY
FOR HIM AT SOUTH CRENSHAW
NEXT SEASON.

02:57.310 --> 02:59.610
WOW. THAT'S REALLY BIG.

02:59.610 --> 03:01.610
I MEAN, YOU--
YOU KNOW THAT.

03:01.610 --> 03:03.250
ARE YOU GOING TO?

03:03.250 --> 03:04.750
I DON'T KNOW YET.

03:04.750 --> 03:06.920
WELL, I'M NOT GONNA LIE.
THAT WOULD SUCK.

03:06.920 --> 03:10.390
BUT I GUESS IT WOULDN'T
SUCK FOR SOUTH CRENSHAW
OR YOUR DAD.

03:10.390 --> 03:14.490
JUST TALK TO HIM.
I MEAN, AVOIDING HIM ISN'T
GONNA MAKE IT ANY EASIER.

03:14.490 --> 03:16.230
YEAH, MAYBE.

03:16.230 --> 03:17.290
LISTEN, DON'T SAY NOTHING
TO CHRIS, ALL RIGHT?

03:17.290 --> 03:18.760
NOT TILL I'VE GOT THIS
FIGURED OUT.

03:18.760 --> 03:20.660
I DON'T WANT HIM
GETTING HIS HOPES UP.

03:20.660 --> 03:23.500
YEAH, I DON'T THINK
NOT TELLING CHRIS IS
GONNA BE A PROBLEM.

03:23.500 --> 03:24.670
WHY? WHAT'S GOING ON?

03:24.670 --> 03:26.670
CHRIS AND I KINDA
BROKE UP.

03:26.670 --> 03:28.770
WELL, CORRECTION.
HE BROKE UP WITH ME.

03:28.770 --> 03:31.570
IT'S NOT A BIG DEAL.
DON'T REALLY WANT
TO TALK ABOUT IT,

03:31.570 --> 03:32.780
SO BACK TO YOUR DAD.

03:32.780 --> 03:34.510
-OLIVIA--
-SPENCER, IT'S OK,

03:34.510 --> 03:35.950
REALLY. UM...

03:35.950 --> 03:39.680
HE NEEDS TO FOCUS
ON PHYSICAL REHAB

03:39.680 --> 03:42.850
WITH NO DISTRACTIONS
AND APPARENTLY
THAT'S WHAT I AM.

03:42.850 --> 03:45.860
JORDAN: SPENCE, LIV,
THIS IS, UH, CHANNEL.

03:45.860 --> 03:47.960
CHANEL.
NICE TO MEET YOU.

03:47.960 --> 03:50.590
RIGHT. OK, LOOK, I'M
GONNA TAKE HER HOME,

03:50.590 --> 03:52.530
SO I'LL SEE YOU GUYS
AT SCHOOL?

03:52.530 --> 03:54.300
COOL. LET'S DO IT.

04:00.140 --> 04:02.140
-DOES SHE LOOK LIKE--
-YOUR MOM? YEAH.

04:02.140 --> 04:03.370
YEAH.

04:05.470 --> 04:07.740
HEY, SORRY I SLEPT
THROUGH THE GYM.

04:07.740 --> 04:09.610
HEY, JULIE AND I
SNUCK OUT LAST NIGHT,

04:09.610 --> 04:12.220
HAD OUR OWN WORKOUT WITH
SOME COLLEGE CHICKS.

04:12.220 --> 04:14.220
YO, COME ON, MAN.

04:14.220 --> 04:16.220
EVER SINCE WE WON STATE,
YOU AND JORDAN HAVE BEEN

04:16.220 --> 04:18.220
PARTYING OUT
AND HALF-ASSING PRACTICES.

04:18.220 --> 04:20.660
"HALF-ASSING" IS A
LITTLE AGGRESSIVE, BRO.

04:20.660 --> 04:23.660
WHATEVER, MAN.
JUST BRING IT
AT PRACTICE TODAY.

04:23.660 --> 04:27.260
OH, COACH DAVIS SAID
TODAY IS, UH, OPTIONAL.

04:27.260 --> 04:29.300
OUR FIRST SCRIMMAGE
IS TOMORROW.

04:29.300 --> 04:31.370
WHEN'D YOU STOP CARING
ABOUT FOOTBALL, MAN?

04:31.370 --> 04:35.170
OH, CHILL. I MEAN,
EVEN COACH BAKER'S
STILL ON VACATION.

04:36.770 --> 04:39.110
SPENCER:
WHAT'S UP?

04:40.380 --> 04:41.910
Y'ALL SEEN LAYLA?

04:41.910 --> 04:44.250
JJ: UH, MAYBE--MAYBE
SHE SLEPT IN.

04:44.250 --> 04:45.780
YOU KNOW, PEOPLE DO
THAT OCCASIONALLY.

04:45.780 --> 04:48.920
SPENCER: NO, MAN, NOT LAYLA.
SHE'S NEVER LATE.

05:30.060 --> 05:33.700
MAN, LAYLA STILL
AIN'T HIT ME BACK.
I HOPE SHE A'IGHT.

05:33.700 --> 05:37.200
HEH! SHE LOOKS FINE TO ME.

05:39.300 --> 05:41.600
-I'MA HOLLA AT YOU.
-ALL RIGHT, MAN.

05:41.600 --> 05:44.370
LATER.

05:44.370 --> 05:46.440
OH, I'LL SEE YOU LATER.

05:46.440 --> 05:48.110
-OK, BYE.
-HEY.

05:48.110 --> 05:49.610
WHERE YOU BEEN?
DIDN'T GET MY TEXT?

05:49.610 --> 05:51.080
SORRY.

05:51.080 --> 05:52.610
I WAS AT BREAKFAST
WITH MY DAD.

05:52.610 --> 05:54.980
-SO YOU SKIPPED CLASS?
-WELL, BREAKFAST WITH MY DAD

05:54.980 --> 05:58.050
DOESN'T HAPPEN VERY OFTEN,
AND CLASS DOES EVERY DAY.

05:58.050 --> 05:59.920
OK.
I WAS JUST WORRIED.

05:59.920 --> 06:01.020
DON'T BE.

06:01.020 --> 06:03.390
I'M GOOD.
I'M BETTER THAN GOOD.

06:03.390 --> 06:05.530
I GET TO SEE MY MAN TAKE
THE FIELD TOMORROW.

06:05.530 --> 06:07.000
YOU SURE YOU'RE NOT
GONNA SKIP IT?

06:07.000 --> 06:08.930
I COULDN'T EVEN
IF I WANTED TO.

06:08.930 --> 06:10.930
STUDENT COUNCIL IS HAVING
A RAFFLE TO RAISE MONEY

06:10.930 --> 06:13.200
FOR THE TEAM, SO YOU
BETTER COME TO PLAY.

06:13.200 --> 06:14.670
-YOU KNOW I ALWAYS DO.
-GOOD, BECAUSE

06:14.670 --> 06:16.440
IF NOT, I JUST
MIGHT SKIP IT.

06:16.440 --> 06:19.610
OH. OUCH. OK.

06:36.060 --> 06:39.160
BABY, THIS IS SO GOOD.
THIS IS REALLY GOOD.

06:39.160 --> 06:42.000
HEH! YOU LIKE IT
FOR REAL, OR YOU LYING
'CAUSE YOU MY GIRL?

06:42.000 --> 06:45.170
NO, I LIKE IT FOR REAL.
I MEAN, YOU KNEW I WOULD.

06:45.170 --> 06:47.170
-JUST WANTED TO HEAR YOU SAY IT.
-SUCH A DIVA.

06:47.170 --> 06:49.140
-YOU ALREADY KNOW.
-MM-HMM.

06:49.140 --> 06:51.770
WELL, I CAN'T WAIT
TO HEAR THE REST.

06:51.770 --> 06:54.680
NEITHER CAN I.
I MEAN, SO EVERY TIME

06:54.680 --> 06:56.450
I SIT DOWN
AND I TRY TO WRITE,
I END UP STARING

06:56.450 --> 06:59.450
AT THAT BLANK-ASS PAGE
AND NOTHING COMES OUT.

06:59.450 --> 07:02.350
OK, WELL, MAYBE I
COULD COME OVER

07:02.350 --> 07:05.120
SO I CAN GIVE YOU
SOME INSPIRATION.

07:05.120 --> 07:07.290
I'M LIKING THE SOUND
OF THAT. HEH!

07:09.020 --> 07:11.030
BUT, YOU KNOW,
YOU LIVE WAY CLOSER,

07:11.030 --> 07:13.960
SO WE MIGHT AS WELL
JUST HEAD OVER THERE
AFTER SCHOOL.

07:16.130 --> 07:18.300
I DON'T GET IT.

07:18.300 --> 07:20.640
-WHAT?
-LIKE, HOW DO YOU GO FROM

07:20.640 --> 07:22.870
FACING DOWN A WHOLE,
ENTIRE GANG ONE DAY

07:22.870 --> 07:25.640
AND THEN BEING AFRAID
OF YOUR MOM THE NEXT? LIKE--

07:25.640 --> 07:27.780
-WHAT DOES THAT EVEN MEAN?
-YOU HAVEN'T INVITED ME OVER

07:27.780 --> 07:30.980
SINCE YOU MOVED BACK HOME,
SO WHAT, DID YOU MOVE BACK
INTO THE CLOSET, TOO?

07:30.980 --> 07:33.650
COME ON, GIRL,
YOU TRIPPIN'.
MY MOM KNOWS I'M GAY.

07:33.650 --> 07:36.920
MM-HMM. I MEAN, AS LONG AS
SHE DOESN'T SEE IT, RIGHT?

07:36.920 --> 07:39.250
NO, IT'S NOT EVEN
LIKE THAT.

07:39.250 --> 07:41.260
YEAH.

07:42.660 --> 07:45.790
PATIENCE!

07:45.790 --> 07:48.000
HEY, DON JUAN.

07:48.000 --> 07:50.800
WHAT THE HELL WAS
THAT GIRL DOING IN
OUR HOUSE THIS MORNING?

07:50.800 --> 07:55.000
WELL, FIRST OFF,
SHE'S IN COLLEGE,
SO SHE'S A WOMAN,

07:55.000 --> 07:57.010
AND I THINK YOU KNOW
WHAT SHE WAS DOING THERE,

07:57.010 --> 07:59.440
BUT IF YOU NEED ME
TO BREAK IT DOWN
FOR YOU, I WILL.

07:59.440 --> 08:02.210
ARE YOU INSANE?
WHAT IF MOM CAUGHT YOU?

08:02.210 --> 08:03.810
WELL, BASED ON THE WAY
SHE'S BEEN ACTING LATELY,

08:03.810 --> 08:05.610
SHE'D PROBABLY PRETEND
TO BE COOL WITH IT.

08:05.610 --> 08:07.120
LOOK, WHY DON'T YOU JUST
TRY TO DO THE SAME?

08:07.120 --> 08:09.080
OK, SHE'S ONLY
PRETENDING

08:09.080 --> 08:11.350
BECAUSE SHE FEELS GUILTY
ABOUT DAD LEAVING,

08:11.350 --> 08:13.620
WHICH, BY THE WAY,
ISN'T HER FAULT,

08:13.620 --> 08:15.090
SO WHY ARE YOU BEING
A JACKASS?

08:15.090 --> 08:17.090
WHY ARE YOU BEING
ANNOYING, LIV?

08:17.090 --> 08:18.390
WE HAVE FREE REIN.
WE MIGHT AS WELL
HAVE SOME FUN,

08:18.390 --> 08:20.830
AND IF YOU DON'T WANT TO,
THAT'S FINE.

08:20.830 --> 08:23.700
JUST AT LEAST STOP
RUINING MINE.

08:26.840 --> 08:28.740
SPENCER:
YO, WHAT'S UP, CHRIS?

08:28.740 --> 08:30.310
LOOK, I KNOW YOU'RE OUT
IN A.T.L. GETTING YOKED

08:30.310 --> 08:32.240
FOR THE NEXT SEASON, BUT I
JUST THOUGHT YOU'D APPRECIATE

08:32.240 --> 08:34.910
SEEING WHAT'S WAITING
FOR YOU WHEN YOU GET BACK.

08:34.910 --> 08:37.250
YOUR TEAM MISSES YOU, DAWG,
SO DO WHAT YOU GOT TO DO

08:37.250 --> 08:38.980
AND HURRY UP AND GET
YOUR ASS BACK, A'IGHT?

08:38.980 --> 08:40.780
YO, BILL BELICHICK,

08:40.780 --> 08:42.750
GET YOUR SPYING ASS
OFF OUR FIELD.

08:42.750 --> 08:44.650
YO, CHILL, MAN.
I'M RECORDING A VIDEO
FOR CHRIS WHILE I WAIT

08:44.650 --> 08:46.150
FOR MY POPS
TO FINISH UP, A'IGHT?

08:46.150 --> 08:48.420
OH, WELL, IN THAT CASE,
HEY, CHRIS JACKSON,

08:48.420 --> 08:50.730
GET YOUR BLACK ASS BACK
ON OUR FIELD.

08:50.730 --> 08:52.930
-SEE? EVEN CAM MISSES YOU, DAWG.
-NAW, NAW.

08:52.930 --> 08:55.400
I'M JUST SAYING YOU BETTER
NOT BE GONE TOO LONG

08:55.400 --> 08:58.070
'CAUSE YOUR NEW BACKUP'S
GOT A CANNON, BRO.

08:58.070 --> 08:59.800
WHAT ARE YOU DOING, MAN?
HE AIN'T GOTTA
SEE ALL THAT.

08:59.800 --> 09:01.840
LOOK, I'M JUST TRYING
TO LIGHT A FIRE
UNDER HIS ASS.

09:01.840 --> 09:03.870
IF CHRIS DON'T COME BACK
ON HIS "A" GAME, HE'S
GETTING REPLACED.

09:03.870 --> 09:08.110
THIS NEW KID COACH COREY
BROUGHT IN FROM NEVADA
AIN'T NO JOKE.

09:09.710 --> 09:11.710
YOU SAY FROM NEVADA?

09:11.710 --> 09:14.080
MM-HMM.

09:14.080 --> 09:16.220
CAM: WHAT, YOUR POPS
DIDN'T TELL YOU ABOUT HIM?

09:16.220 --> 09:18.950
THEY SUPER CLOSE, TOO.

09:20.620 --> 09:24.590
MAYBE CHRIS AIN'T THE ONLY ONE
ABOUT TO BE REPLACED.

09:33.800 --> 09:35.600
COOP: PATIENCE,
I'M SORRY, OK?

09:35.600 --> 09:37.610
EVERYBODY ALREADY
HATES ME IN SCHOOL

09:37.610 --> 09:39.110
FOR SNITCHING ON TYRONE.

09:39.610 --> 09:41.840
PLEASE DON'T TELL ME
YOU JOINED THE LIST.

09:41.840 --> 09:43.940
I DON'T HATE YOU,
TAMIA.

09:43.940 --> 09:45.450
"TAMIA"?

09:45.450 --> 09:46.850
NOT "BABE"?

09:46.850 --> 09:48.480
YOU DO HATE ME.

09:48.480 --> 09:51.190
A'IGHT, BUT DO YOU HATE
MY NEW LYRICS?

09:51.190 --> 09:52.990
CHECK IT.

09:52.990 --> 09:54.520

09:54.520 --> 09:57.930

09:57.930 --> 09:59.260
STOP, STOP.

09:59.260 --> 10:01.200
YES, THOSE I HATE.

10:01.200 --> 10:02.960
GOD, YOU'RE
SO ANNOYING.

10:02.960 --> 10:05.600
YOU'RE SO ANNOYING.
DON'T--DON'T
EVEN HUG ME.

10:05.600 --> 10:07.130
YOU'RE SO ANNOYING.
UGH.

10:07.130 --> 10:08.500
-SPENCE, WHAT'S UP?
-WHAT'S UP?

10:08.500 --> 10:10.470
MOVE BACK ALREADY?

10:10.470 --> 10:12.370
HEY, MY LIPS
ARE SEALED, OK?

10:14.210 --> 10:16.480
NAH, I WAS JUST
CHECKING OUT THAT
CRENSHAW PRACTICE.

10:16.480 --> 10:18.880
Y'ALL KNOW ANYTHING
ABOUT THAT NEW QB?

10:18.880 --> 10:21.980
COME ON, MAN.

10:21.980 --> 10:24.020
PATIENCE: YEAH, WE'LL WATCH

10:24.020 --> 10:26.020
LOYALTY. I LIKE--
I LIKE THAT. HA HA.

10:26.020 --> 10:27.150
BOY: SMELLS LIKE SNITCH.

10:27.150 --> 10:29.890
Y'ALL FELLAS GOT
SOMETHING TO SAY?

10:29.890 --> 10:34.230
SEE, I WOULD TELL YOU,
BUT, UH, YOUR NARC
FRIEND WOULD RAT US OUT.

10:34.230 --> 10:37.130
SPENCER: MAYBE SHE AIN'T THE ONE
YOU GOT TO BE WORRIED ABOUT.

10:37.130 --> 10:38.670
LOOK, COME ON.
IT'S ALL GOOD.

10:38.670 --> 10:41.140
IT AIN'T ALL GOOD.
HOW COME YOU AIN'T
SAY NOTHIN'?

10:41.140 --> 10:43.100
WHAT YOU WANT ME TO SAY?
THEY'RE NOT WORTH MY TIME.

10:43.100 --> 10:45.110
HOLD UP.
SINCE WHEN DOES COOP NOT
STAND UP FOR HERSELF?

10:45.110 --> 10:47.170
PATIENCE: OH, YEAH, SHE'S
BEEN REAL QUIET LATELY.

10:47.170 --> 10:49.240
AT HERE, AT HOME.

10:51.380 --> 10:54.380
WHATEVER. UM, LOOK,
I GOT TO GO, SO I WILL
CATCH YOU GUYS LATER, OK?

10:54.380 --> 10:56.680
WHAT'S THAT ALL ABOUT?

10:56.680 --> 11:00.650
SHE IS TRIPPIN', BRO, AND
IT'S PROBABLY 'CAUSE I AIN'T
HAD HER OVER IN A WHILE.

11:00.650 --> 11:01.990
-ALL RIGHT, SO INVITE HER OVER.
-COME ON.

11:01.990 --> 11:03.360
MY MOMS IS A WORK
IN PROGRESS.

11:03.360 --> 11:05.130
I CAN'T JUST PUT
THEM TWO TOGETHER
IN A ROOM.

11:05.130 --> 11:07.530
LOOK, PATIENCE IS YOUR GIRL,
AND SHE FELL IN LOVE

11:07.530 --> 11:09.260
WITH THE COOP WHO SPEAKS
HER MIND, NO MATTER WHAT,

11:09.260 --> 11:11.070
THE COOP I'VE KNOWN
MY WHOLE LIFE.

11:11.070 --> 11:13.200
NOTHING CHANGED, MAN.
I'M STILL THE SAME PERSON.

11:13.200 --> 11:15.840
NOT FROM WHAT I JUST SAW.

11:27.350 --> 11:29.280
TO THE STATE CHAMPS
AND THE LADIES
WHO LOVE THEM.

11:29.280 --> 11:31.020
-YEAH.
-DRINK TO THAT.

11:31.020 --> 11:32.620
JORDAN: LET'S TAKE
A SELFIE, GUYS.

11:32.620 --> 11:34.960
LET'S DO IT.
YOUR PHONE?

11:34.960 --> 11:37.860
JORDAN: I'VE TAKEN
SO MANY OF THESE...

11:39.890 --> 11:43.100
#STATECHAMPLIFE.
HMM.

11:44.670 --> 11:47.900
IS IT WRONG
THAT I KINDA WISH
THEY LOST THAT GAME?

11:47.900 --> 11:51.840
YES, LIV, YOU'RE AN EAGLE.
THEY'RE JUST HAVING FUN.

11:53.540 --> 11:55.910
YEAH, I DON'T SEE FUN.
I SEE A SIGN AROUND HIS NECK

11:55.910 --> 11:58.510
THAT SAYS "HELP ME"
WRITTEN IN THAT GIRL'S
LIPSTICK.

11:58.510 --> 12:01.180
YOU SEE THAT SIGN
AROUND EVERYONE'S NECK,
MAYBE MINUS THE LIPSTICK.

12:01.180 --> 12:03.450
-OK, THAT'S NOT TRUE.
-NO?

12:03.450 --> 12:06.590
HOW MANY TIMES HAVE YOU
ASKED ME ABOUT MY DAD
SINCE HE'S BEEN BACK?

12:06.590 --> 12:08.460
ONE...

12:08.460 --> 12:10.460
MMM...

12:10.460 --> 12:11.860
-HUNDRED?
-CLOSER, YEAH.

12:11.860 --> 12:14.860
I'M SORRY.
I'M JUST REALLY HAPPY

12:14.860 --> 12:17.100
THAT YOU TWO ARE
DOING SO WELL.

12:17.100 --> 12:19.870
IT'S LIKE WE'RE PLAYING
MUSICAL FATHERS.

12:19.870 --> 12:21.340
MINE LEAVES,
YOURS COMES BACK.

12:21.340 --> 12:23.070
DON'T FORGET
ABOUT SPENCER'S DAD.

12:23.070 --> 12:25.140
HOW COULD I? I MEAN,
I CAN'T BELIEVE HE WANTS

12:25.140 --> 12:27.510
SPENCER TO MOVE BACK
TO CRENSHAW.

12:32.480 --> 12:34.980
AND I HAVE THE BIGGEST
MOUTH IN THE WORLD.

12:34.980 --> 12:38.490
I AM SO SORRY.
HE DIDN'T WANT
TO TELL ME, OK?

12:38.490 --> 12:41.220
I PRIED IT OUT OF HIM
THIS MORNING, AND I JUST
ASSUMED THAT HE TOLD YOU.

12:41.220 --> 12:44.220
LIV, IT'S FINE.
SURE HE WAS PLANNING
ON TELLING ME.

12:44.220 --> 12:47.490
HE JUST HASN'T GOTTEN
THE CHANCE YET.

12:47.490 --> 12:49.900
-HERE YOU GO.
-THERE IT IS.

12:49.900 --> 12:52.500
-NO? OK.
-HA HA HA!

12:54.500 --> 12:57.040
HEY. SO THIS IS
WHY YOU GUYS
MISSED PRACTICE?

12:57.040 --> 12:58.310
-PRACTICE?
-HA HA!

12:58.310 --> 12:59.970
I MEAN, WE'RE TALKING
ABOUT PRACTICE?

12:59.970 --> 13:01.310
YEAH,
IT WAS OPTIONAL.

13:01.310 --> 13:03.610
AND...
GAME TOMORROW ISN'T.

13:03.610 --> 13:06.510
ASHER: LOOK, I GUARANTEE
YOU GUYS THAT ENCINO'S
BEEN PRACTICING.

13:06.510 --> 13:08.450
YEAH, OF COURSE THEY
HAVE BEEN, OK?

13:08.450 --> 13:10.480
THEY'RE ABOUT TO FACE
THE STATE CHAMPS, ASH.

13:10.480 --> 13:12.620
HEY, YOU'RE OUR
QUARTERBACK, JORDAN.

13:12.620 --> 13:14.860
WE SHOULD BE RUNNING
OUR PLAYS RIGHT NOW.

13:14.860 --> 13:17.860
WE ALREADY KNOW THE PLAYS.
YOU--YOU NEED TO RELAX,
SERIOUSLY.

13:17.860 --> 13:19.860
JJ, TELL HIM
YOUR JOKE, PLEASE.

13:19.860 --> 13:21.800
OH, UH, KNOCK KNOCK.

13:23.130 --> 13:24.200
-OK, WHO'S THERE?
-HA HA!

13:24.200 --> 13:26.000
STATE CHAMPS, BABY!

13:26.000 --> 13:27.330
JORDAN: WHOO! HA HA!

13:27.330 --> 13:29.870
JJ: HA HA! OK.

13:34.880 --> 13:37.480
-THANK YOU.
-OH, YOU'RE WELCOME.

13:37.480 --> 13:41.080
SO, LISTEN, I, UH, I JUST
DROPPED BY TO THANK YOU

13:41.080 --> 13:44.890
FOR THE MUCH-NEEDED
KICK IN THE BEHIND
YOU GAVE ME LAST WEEK.

13:44.890 --> 13:47.390
WELL, THAT IS DEFINITELY
AN IMPROVEMENT.

13:47.390 --> 13:51.020
THE MIRACLES OF A RAZOR
AND A SHOWER.

13:51.020 --> 13:52.490
YEAH.

13:52.490 --> 13:55.630
HOW'S, UH...HOW'S SPENCER?

13:55.630 --> 13:58.230
HE'S STILL NOT SURE
WHAT SCHOOL HE'S GONNA
PLAY FOR NEXT YEAR.

13:58.730 --> 14:01.940
HE'S AFRAID HE'S
GONNA MAKE THE
WRONG DECISION...

14:01.940 --> 14:04.940
WHICH, I HEAR,
HAS BEEN GOING AROUND.

14:07.470 --> 14:09.610
SPENCER TOLD ME
YOU'RE RESIGNING.

14:09.610 --> 14:12.010
I THINK YOU'RE MAKING
A HUGE MISTAKE.

14:12.010 --> 14:16.350
YOU KNOW, I JUST WANT
TO DO WHAT'S RIGHT FOR
MY FAMILY RIGHT NOW,

14:16.350 --> 14:19.090
AND I THINK LEAVING THE TEAM
WILL GIVE JORDAN SOME SPACE.

14:19.090 --> 14:22.690
BOYS DON'T NEED SPACE.
THEY NEED THEIR FATHERS.

14:22.690 --> 14:26.360
ISN'T THAT WHY YOU MOVED
BACK HOME, TO MAKE THINGS
RIGHT WITH YOUR DAD?

14:26.360 --> 14:28.460
YEAH, AND LOOK HOW
THAT TURNED OUT.

14:28.460 --> 14:32.570
I BOOKED HIM A FLIGHT
BACK FROM FLORIDA,
AND HE DIDN'T GET ON IT.

14:32.570 --> 14:36.000
WELL, WILLY MAY NOT
BE IN L.A.,

14:36.000 --> 14:38.370
BUT THERE IS ANOTHER
BAKER MAN WHO IS.

14:38.370 --> 14:41.040
THAT'S WHO YOU SHOULD
BE TALKING TO.

14:41.040 --> 14:44.510
SPACE ISN'T GONNA FIX
YOU AND JORDAN.

14:55.520 --> 14:57.990
WHY THIS THING
GOT YOU SO UPSET?

14:57.990 --> 15:01.030
AIN'T NO KID GONNA
COME IN SOUTH CRENSHAW
AND TAKE CHRIS' SPOT.

15:01.030 --> 15:03.400
WHY NOT?
THAT'S HOW IT WENT DOWN
WHEN I ROLLED TO BEVERLY.

15:03.400 --> 15:05.530
YEAH, BUT THIS KID
AIN'T SPENCER JAMES.

15:05.530 --> 15:07.670
I DON'T KNOW WHO HE IS.

15:07.670 --> 15:09.670
SO WHY DIDN'T YOU ASK
YOUR POPS WHEN YOU WAS
JUST AT THE PRACTICE?

15:09.670 --> 15:11.810
'CAUSE HE WAS TOO BUSY
WITH HIS NEW RECRUITS,
SO I BOUNCED.

15:11.810 --> 15:14.670
HEE HEE! YO, YOU LOVE
MAKING THINGS TOUGH
FOR YOURSELF.

15:14.670 --> 15:15.980
YEAH, LOOK WHO'S
TALKING.

15:15.980 --> 15:17.580
YOU AIN'T EXACTLY
KEEPING IT REAL

15:17.580 --> 15:18.950
WITH YOUR MOMS,
EITHER; OTHERWISE
YOU'D BE

15:18.950 --> 15:20.410
KICKING IT WITH
PATIENCE RIGHT NOW.

15:20.410 --> 15:21.680
CAM: HEY.

15:23.820 --> 15:25.450
-THAT'S HIM?
-YEAH.

15:25.450 --> 15:28.090
HEH! DON'T LOOK
LIKE MUCH TO ME.

15:28.090 --> 15:29.590
YOU KNOW, YOU LEFT
BEFORE I COULD
INTRODUCE YOU

15:29.590 --> 15:31.620
TO COACH'S
FAVORITE NEW QB1.

15:31.620 --> 15:33.760
HEY, I DON'T KNOW
NOTHING ABOUT FOOTBALL,

15:33.760 --> 15:35.360
BUT AIN'T THAT
CHRIS' SPOT?

15:35.360 --> 15:37.100
NAH, NOT WHAT I'VE
BEEN TOLD.

15:37.100 --> 15:39.770
SOMEBODY LIED TO YOU.

15:39.770 --> 15:42.440
AND YOU? CHRIS IS YOUR BOY.
YOU REALLY GONNA
DO HIM LIKE THIS?

15:42.440 --> 15:44.440
LONG AS I GET
MY TARGETS, MAN.

15:44.440 --> 15:46.440
I JUST GOT TO
LOOK OUT FOR MYSELF,

15:46.440 --> 15:48.840
LIKE YOU DID WHEN
YOU WENT TO BEVERLY.

15:48.840 --> 15:50.840
COME ON, BRO.

15:56.380 --> 15:58.520
HA HA!

15:58.520 --> 16:00.850
SIR, YOU REALLY CAN'T
BE DRINKING IN HERE.

16:00.850 --> 16:03.420
LOOK, MAN, WE'RE NOT--WE'RE
NOT BOTHERING ANYBODY, OK?

16:03.420 --> 16:06.390
ACTUALLY, YOU ARE.
PEOPLE ARE COMPLAINING THAT
YOU'RE BEING TOO LOUD.

16:06.390 --> 16:10.000
TOO--HEH! LOOK, I THINK
THEY'RE BEING TOO QUIET.

16:10.000 --> 16:13.670
MAYBE IT'S BEST IF YOU
AND YOUR FRIENDS LEAVE.

16:13.670 --> 16:15.800
REA--YOU'RE KICKING US OUT?

16:15.800 --> 16:17.800
OH, OK. LOOK, BIG GUY,

16:17.800 --> 16:20.940
HOW OFTEN DO YOU GET
STATE CHAMPS IN HERE?

16:20.940 --> 16:23.680
SPENCER JAMES WORKS HERE.

16:23.680 --> 16:25.950
OK, WHATEVER. LOOK,

16:25.950 --> 16:28.620
IF ANYBODY HAS A PROBLEM
WITH THE WAY I AM ACTING,

16:28.620 --> 16:31.120
THEY CAN SAY IT TO MY FACE,
INSTEAD OF WHINING TO
THIS KID RIGHT HERE.

16:31.120 --> 16:33.120
MAN: WE ALL HAVE
A PROBLEM WITH THE WAY

16:33.120 --> 16:35.460
YOUR SPOILED
BITCH-ASS IS ACTING.

16:35.460 --> 16:37.360
YOU'RE BEING A DICK.

16:37.360 --> 16:39.490
OH, YEAH?

16:39.490 --> 16:41.130
WELL, THEN YOUR GIRL
MUST NOT THINK SO,

16:41.130 --> 16:43.130
CONSIDERING SHE'S
ALREADY DM'd ME

16:43.130 --> 16:45.130
WHILE YOU WERE BORING HER
FOR THE LAST HOUR.

16:45.130 --> 16:49.340
HEY, SWEETHEART, YOU WANT
TO DUMP THIS LOSER?
THERE'S ROOM AT OUR TABLE.

16:50.570 --> 16:52.340
KEEP YOUR MOUTH SHUT--

16:59.710 --> 17:01.650
LAURA: THANK YOU FOR NOT
PRESSING CHARGES,

17:01.650 --> 17:03.420
AND I'M REALLY SORRY.

17:03.920 --> 17:07.590
THEY'RE NORMALLY
REALLY GOOD KIDS.

17:07.590 --> 17:09.420
-THANK YOU.
-THANK YOU.

17:09.420 --> 17:11.090
NO PROBLEM.

17:13.460 --> 17:16.300
I DON'T EVEN KNOW WHAT
TO SAY TO YOU RIGHT NOW.

17:16.300 --> 17:19.830
I SHOULD HAVE LET
THAT POLICE OFFICER
TAKE YOU TWO TO JAIL.

17:19.830 --> 17:21.900
-HOW? SHE WAS ON A BICYCLE.

17:21.900 --> 17:23.470
YOU THINK THIS
IS FUNNY, JJ?

17:23.470 --> 17:25.040
-NO, MA'AM.
-'CAUSE YOU TWO ARE GONNA PAY

17:25.040 --> 17:27.110
FOR THE DAMAGES OUT
OF YOUR OWN POCKETS,

17:27.110 --> 17:30.310
AND I AM NOT EVEN CLOSE
TO THROUGH WITH YOU.

17:34.310 --> 17:36.180
-HEY.
-WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

17:36.180 --> 17:38.850
A BETTER QUESTION IS
WHY DIDN'T YOU CALL ME?

17:38.850 --> 17:42.920
I SHOULDN'T HAVE TO FIND OUT
BECAUSE MY SON'S IDIOT FRIEND
LIVESTREAMED THE ARREST.

17:42.920 --> 17:44.460
I DIDN'T CALL YOU BECAUSE I
DIDN'T NEED YOU,

17:44.460 --> 17:46.060
BECAUSE I'VE GOT IT HANDLED.

17:46.060 --> 17:48.090
OK, SURE ABOUT THAT?

17:50.330 --> 17:52.600
GREAT.

17:53.100 --> 17:57.700
YOU KNOW WHAT, BILLY?
JUST...GO BACK
TO YOUR DAD'S.

17:57.700 --> 17:59.770
ALL RIGHT.

18:20.330 --> 18:23.660
IT'S SO GOOD TO SEE YOU
GETTING BACK INTO YOUR MUSIC.

18:23.660 --> 18:27.070
YOU USED TO LOVE TO SING ME
SONGS WHEN YOU WERE LITTLE.

18:27.070 --> 18:28.670
-DID I?
-MM-HMM.

18:28.670 --> 18:31.070
YOUR FAVORITE ONE WAS
"ANOTHER SATURDAY NIGHT,"

18:31.070 --> 18:34.470
ONLY YOU THOUGHT HE WAS SINGING
ABOUT HAVING "NO BODY,"

18:34.470 --> 18:36.840
LIKE HE WAS JUST A HEAD
FLOATIN' OUT THERE.

18:36.840 --> 18:39.340
THAT AIN'T CHANGED.

18:39.340 --> 18:41.680
I STILL CAN'T FIND
THE RIGHT WORDS.

18:41.680 --> 18:44.120
GIRL, DON'T BE
SO HARD ON YOURSELF.

18:46.490 --> 18:49.420
THE WORDS DON'T
REALLY MATTER.

18:49.420 --> 18:53.430
PEOPLE ONLY CARE
ABOUT THE MUSIC AND HOW
IT MAKES THEM FEEL.

18:53.430 --> 18:56.430
YOU KNOW, PATIENCE IS
REALLY DOPE WITH LYRICS,

18:56.430 --> 18:58.460
AND SHE OFFERED
TO HELP ME.

18:58.460 --> 19:01.130
-WELL, THAT'S VERY SWEET OF HER.
-YEAH.

19:01.130 --> 19:04.640
SHE, UH, SAID SHE WAS GONNA
COME OVER TOMORROW NIGHT.

19:04.640 --> 19:07.310
WELL, TOMORROW NIGHT'S
NOT ANY GOOD

19:07.310 --> 19:09.810
'CAUSE, UH, I'M HOSTING
MY CHURCH GROUP.

19:11.080 --> 19:13.310
THAT'S COOL.
I MEAN, WE AIN'T
GONNA BOTHER YOU.

19:13.310 --> 19:14.910
WE'RE JUST GONNA BE
IN MY ROOM, WORKIN'.

19:14.910 --> 19:17.050
WELL, I DON'T THINK
THAT'S A GOOD IDEA.

19:17.050 --> 19:18.920
I MEAN, YOU KNOW HOW
JUDGMENTAL THEY CAN BE.

19:18.920 --> 19:22.790
MOM...THEY KNOW I'M GAY, OK?
I AIN'T BEEN HIDIN' IT.

19:22.790 --> 19:26.590
BUT WE DON'T NEED
TO GO FLAUNTING IT
IN THEIR FACES, DO WE?

19:26.590 --> 19:30.660
I'M JUST TRYING
TO PROTECT YOU AND
PATIENCE, THAT'S ALL.

19:45.480 --> 19:47.510
LAYLA?

19:48.980 --> 19:50.950
WHAT'S GOING ON?

19:52.320 --> 19:54.320
YOU OUT HERE
BY YOURSELF?

19:54.320 --> 19:56.320
WHAT, NO SUITCASES?

19:56.320 --> 19:59.490
NO MOVING VAN
TO TAKE YOUR STUFF
BACK TO CRENSHAW?

19:59.490 --> 20:02.860
-LAYLA, LOOK--
-HOW COULD YOU NOT TELL ME?

20:02.860 --> 20:04.860
I WAS GOING TO, A'IGHT?
I JUST--

20:04.860 --> 20:06.360
YOU JUST THOUGHT IT
WOULD SOUND BETTER
COMING FROM OLIVIA?

20:06.360 --> 20:08.470
NO, I WASN'T PLANNING
ON TELLING ANYONE,

20:08.470 --> 20:10.870
NOT UNTIL I KNEW WHAT
I WAS GONNA DO.

20:10.870 --> 20:13.940
WOW. SO NOW I'M
JUST ANYONE.

20:13.940 --> 20:15.540
BABY, COME ON.

20:15.540 --> 20:17.480
YOU KNOW I LOVE YOU.

20:17.480 --> 20:19.480
LOOK, YOU'VE BEEN SO HAPPY
WITH YOUR DAD BEING BACK,

20:19.480 --> 20:21.110
I DIDN'T WANT TO RUIN THAT
BY BRINGING THIS UP,

20:21.110 --> 20:23.150
ESPECIALLY WHEN
NOTHING'S BEEN DECIDED.

20:23.150 --> 20:26.480
SO YOU WANT ME TO
BELIEVE THAT YOU LIED
TO ME FOR MY OWN GOOD?

20:26.480 --> 20:28.550
-I DIDN'T LIE.
-NO, IT'S ALL GOOD.

20:28.550 --> 20:30.990
YOU KNOW, I DON'T KNOW
WHY I BOTHER TO CARE

20:30.990 --> 20:33.020
SO MUCH ABOUT
OTHER PEOPLE'S FEELINGS

20:33.020 --> 20:35.960
WHEN NO ONE SEEMS
TO CARE ABOUT MINE,

20:35.960 --> 20:38.900
SO FROM NOW ON, I'M
JUST GONNA WORRY
ABOUT MYSELF.

20:56.380 --> 20:58.650
HEY. YOU OK?

20:58.650 --> 21:00.250
YEAH.

21:00.250 --> 21:02.550
YEAH, I WAS ACTUALLY
LOOKING FOR JORDAN.

21:02.550 --> 21:04.590
HE'S GONE M.I.A.
AND HE'S NOT
ANSWERING HIS PHONE

21:04.590 --> 21:07.190
AND MY MOM'S
ON A WARPATH,

21:07.190 --> 21:10.060
SO I FIGURED IT WAS
SAFER FOR HIM IF I
FOUND HIM FIRST.

21:10.060 --> 21:13.330
YEAH...
I HEARD ABOUT THE FIGHT.

21:14.930 --> 21:17.340
THE TRACK COACH SAID
HE MIGHT BE BACK HERE.
IS HE?

21:17.340 --> 21:19.470
NO, I'M SORRY. JUST ME.

21:19.470 --> 21:21.970
OK. UM, THANKS.

21:21.970 --> 21:23.840
YEAH.

21:25.610 --> 21:27.510
WAIT. WHY ARE YOU
STILL HERE?

21:27.510 --> 21:29.510
ISN'T FOOTBALL
PRACTICE WAY OVER?

21:29.510 --> 21:32.020
I'VE JUST BEEN
GETTING IN EXTRA TIME

21:32.020 --> 21:33.950
IN THE WEIGHT ROOM
AND ON THE FIELD.

21:33.950 --> 21:36.020
GUYS ARE ALL RIDING HIGH
ON THE CHAMPIONSHIP,

21:36.020 --> 21:39.020
BUT MY RANKING TOOK
A MAJOR HIT LAST SEASON.

21:39.020 --> 21:41.090
BEST THING I GOT GOING
FOR ME RIGHT NOW IS
JUNIOR COLLEGE,

21:41.090 --> 21:45.030
AND THAT'S...THAT'S
NOT GOOD ENOUGH.

21:45.030 --> 21:49.830
7-ON-7s MIGHT BE
MY BEST CHANCE TO GET BACK
ON A D1 SCHOOL'S RADAR.

21:53.570 --> 21:55.240
WHAT?

21:55.240 --> 21:57.240
I'M JUST PROUD OF YOU.

22:00.010 --> 22:03.920
WELL, I WILL LET YOU
GET BACK TO IT.

22:03.920 --> 22:05.350
YEAH.

22:18.460 --> 22:20.470

22:20.470 --> 22:23.330
YEAH, THAT'S MY BAD.
I BEEN KINDA BUSY.

22:23.330 --> 22:26.070
COME ON IN, SIT DOWN.

22:34.010 --> 22:36.010
LOOK, POPS, THIS NEW KID
FROM NEVADA...

22:37.350 --> 22:39.080
WHY HE THINK HE TAKING
CHRIS' SPOT?

22:39.080 --> 22:41.120
I MEAN, HOW YOU JUST
WRITING CHRIS OFF

22:41.120 --> 22:43.150
WITHOUT GIVING HIM
A CHANCE TO BOUNCE BACK?
THAT'S NOT FA--

22:43.150 --> 22:45.020
WHOA, EASY, SON.
FIRST OF ALL,

22:45.020 --> 22:47.090
THE KID FROM NEVADA,
HE'S GOT A NAME.

22:47.090 --> 22:48.960
IT'S DARNELL.

22:48.960 --> 22:51.230
HE'S WHY I'VE BEEN TRYING
TO GET A HOLD OF YOU.

22:52.500 --> 22:53.560
DARNELL.

22:53.560 --> 22:56.370
YEP, I'M COMING.

22:56.370 --> 22:59.040
OH...

22:59.040 --> 23:01.040
DARNELL: HEY, MAN.

23:01.040 --> 23:02.670
LOOK, MY BAD
ABOUT EARLIER.

23:02.670 --> 23:05.440
I NEVER WOULD HAVE
GONE DOWN LIKE THAT IF
I'D KNOWN WHO YOU WERE.

23:05.440 --> 23:07.950
IT WAS NICE
MEETING YOU, THOUGH.

23:09.310 --> 23:11.850
WHAT IS THIS?

23:14.450 --> 23:16.450
DARNELL IS
MY EX-GIRLFRIEND'S SON.

23:16.450 --> 23:19.190
HE LIVED WITH US
IN, UH, NEVADA,

23:19.190 --> 23:23.330
BUT NOW HE'S GONNA LIVE
WITH ME OUT HERE FOR A
LITTLE WHILE.

23:24.630 --> 23:27.930
Y'ALL LIVED TOGETHER
IN NEVADA?

23:29.130 --> 23:31.270
YEAH.

23:34.110 --> 23:36.110
I SHOULD HAVE KNOWN.

23:36.110 --> 23:38.010
HEY, SPENCER?

23:38.010 --> 23:40.010
NO, THAT'S MY BAD.

23:40.010 --> 23:42.350
I BROKE UP Y'ALL
LITTLE FAMILY REUNION.

23:42.350 --> 23:45.350
SPENCER, WAIT.

23:54.890 --> 23:56.890
JJ: DUDE, MY MOM WAS

23:56.890 --> 23:58.900
SO PISSED
ABOUT YESTERDAY.

23:58.900 --> 24:01.000
LUCKILY, SHE BELIEVED
ME WHEN I SAID IT WAS
ALL YOUR FAULT.

24:01.000 --> 24:01.970
-AH, OK.
-HA HA!

24:01.970 --> 24:03.500
WHAT'D YOUR MOM DO
TO YOU?

24:03.500 --> 24:04.970
I'VE BEEN DODGING HER,
BUT MY GUESS IS

24:04.970 --> 24:07.310
SHE'LL DO NOTHING,
AS USUAL.

24:09.570 --> 24:11.910
NICE OF YOU
TO SHOW UP, MAN.

24:11.910 --> 24:14.250
HEY, DON'T START
WITH ME, BOY,
A'IGHT? NOT TODAY.

24:14.250 --> 24:15.980
SPENCER: LAYLA,
CAN YOU CALL ME BACK?

24:15.980 --> 24:17.920
LOOK, I'M SORRY
ABOUT YESTERDAY.

24:17.920 --> 24:20.250
I JUST NEED TO TALK
TO YOU, A'IGHT?

24:20.250 --> 24:21.850
HEY!

24:21.850 --> 24:24.960
WHAT THE HELL IS UP,
GUYS? WHO DIED?

24:24.960 --> 24:27.460
I'LL TELL YOU WHO'S
ABOUT TO DIE.

24:27.460 --> 24:29.790
THE ENCINO PANTHERS,
THAT'S WHO.

24:31.500 --> 24:33.500
LET ME HEAR IT!
WHOSE HOUSE?

24:33.500 --> 24:34.930
ALL: OUR HOUSE.

24:34.930 --> 24:38.000
WHAT, THAT'S ALL
WE'VE GOT?

24:38.000 --> 24:40.000
HEY!

24:40.000 --> 24:42.140
WE'RE THE DAMN
BEVERLY EAGLES!

24:42.140 --> 24:44.010
WAIT, I--I SAID
THAT WRONG.

24:44.010 --> 24:47.350
WE'RE THE STATE CHAMPION
BEVERLY EAGLES.

24:47.350 --> 24:49.210
-RIGHT. YEAH.
-RIGHT?

24:49.210 --> 24:52.120
LET'S MAKE IT
SO LOUD, COACH BAKER
HEARS US IN HAWAII!

24:52.120 --> 24:53.350
WHOSE HOUSE?

24:53.350 --> 24:56.090
-OUR HOUSE!
-SCREW COACH BAKER!

24:56.090 --> 24:59.290
HE ISN'T LOUNGING
ON SOME HAWAIIAN BEACH.

24:59.290 --> 25:02.030
SPENCER:
NOW'S NOT THE TIME, MAN.

25:02.030 --> 25:04.900
HE'S PASSED OUT
ON MY GRANDPA'S COUCH.

25:06.430 --> 25:08.430
MY DAD QUIT

25:08.430 --> 25:11.470
ON ALL OF US, BUT WHO CARES?

25:11.470 --> 25:15.310
WE DON'T NEED HIM OR
ANYONE ELSE WHO DECIDES
TO QUIT ON THIS TEAM.

25:18.310 --> 25:20.440
LET'S GET THIS OVER WITH.

25:27.920 --> 25:30.320
NAOMI AUGUST:
♪ I WANT TO GIVE YOU... ♪

25:33.460 --> 25:35.830
I TALKED TO MY MOM.

25:37.960 --> 25:42.130
AND BY THE LOOK ON YOUR FACE,
I'M GUESSING I'M NOT COMING
OVER ANYTIME SOON.

25:42.130 --> 25:45.440
SHE'S NOT THE EASIEST
PERSON TO TALK TO,
BUT AT LEAST I TRIED.

25:45.440 --> 25:47.440
REALLY?

25:47.440 --> 25:50.440
WELL, DID YOU TELL HER
THAT YOU NEED TO LIVE
YOUR OWN LIFE

25:50.440 --> 25:54.710
AND THAT ACCEPTING YOU
MEANS ACCEPTING WHO
YOU WANT TO BE WITH?

25:54.710 --> 25:57.850
I THINK IT'S A MIRACLE
SHE LET HER GAY DAUGHTER

25:57.850 --> 26:00.120
BACK IN THE HOUSE
IN THE FIRST PLACE.

26:00.120 --> 26:02.320
SO THAT'S A NO.

26:03.920 --> 26:05.320
I MEAN, WHY CAN'T YOU
JUST BE HONEST?

26:05.320 --> 26:06.790
-WHO SAYS I'M NOT?
-THAT'S JUST LIKE

26:06.790 --> 26:08.660
YOU'RE NOT SAYING
ANYTHING.

26:08.660 --> 26:10.430
LOOK, EVER SINCE
PEOPLE CAME AT YOU

26:10.430 --> 26:11.960
FOR BEING A SNITCH,
IT'S LIKE--

26:11.960 --> 26:14.060
IT'S LIKE YOU'RE AFRAID
TO SPEAK YOUR MIND.

26:14.060 --> 26:15.730
DAMN RIGHT I AM.

26:15.730 --> 26:17.100
EVERY TIME
I OPEN MY MOUTH,
SOMEBODY GET HURT.

26:17.100 --> 26:18.800
MY MOM, PREACH,
SHAWN.

26:18.800 --> 26:20.940
I'M NOT TRYIN'
TO HURT YOU, TOO.

26:20.940 --> 26:22.970
YEAH, WELL,
YOU ARE HURTING ME
BY STAYING QUIET.

26:22.970 --> 26:25.610
WELL, BABY--HEH!--
YOU'RE MAKING THIS
WAY TOO BIG OF A DEAL.

26:25.610 --> 26:27.540
MY MOM IS NOT SAYING
WE CAN'T BE TOGETHER.

26:27.540 --> 26:29.010
THAT'S EXACTLY
WHAT SHE'S SAYING

26:29.010 --> 26:30.950
EVERY TIME SHE MAKES YOU
HIDE WHO YOU ARE.

26:30.950 --> 26:32.420
AND IF YOU ALLOW HER, THEN
YOU'RE SAYING THAT, TOO.

26:32.420 --> 26:34.020
WE AIN'T ALL GOT PARENTS
AS COOL AS YOURS.

26:34.020 --> 26:36.020
YOUR MOMS ACCEPTED YOU,
STRAIGHT OUT OF THE GATE.

26:36.020 --> 26:38.020
LOOK, ALL I'M SAYING IS
THAT YOU JUST NEED
TO FIGURE OUT A WAY

26:38.020 --> 26:39.990
TO MAKE HER LISTEN,
BECAUSE IF YOU DON'T,

26:39.990 --> 26:43.430
THEN...SHE'S JUST GONNA END UP
HURTING YOU ALL OVER AGAIN.

26:43.430 --> 26:45.460
MAYBE IT'S YOU WHO
NEED TO LISTEN.

26:45.460 --> 26:48.100
I TRIED TALKING TO HER.
IT DIDN'T WORK.

26:48.100 --> 26:50.870
SHE TOLD ME WORDS
DON'T MATTER,

26:50.870 --> 26:55.370
SO IT DOESN'T MATTER
WHAT I SAY OR HOW MANY
TIMES I SAY IT.

WEREN'T EVEN MY FAULT.

30:25.750 --> 30:28.220
YOU AND SPENCER
WEREN'T EXACTLY
ON FIRE TODAY, EITHER.

30:28.220 --> 30:30.750
YEAH, THAT'S MY BAD.
MY HEAD WASN'T IN IT TODAY.

30:30.750 --> 30:32.990

HAVE PRACTICED, GUYS.

30:32.990 --> 30:35.060
ENCINO DIDN'T
GET BETTER,

30:35.060 --> 30:36.590
WE GOT WORSE.

ASHER'S RIGHT.

30:41.130 --> 30:43.730
I DON'T BLAME HIM

30:43.730 --> 30:45.470
BUT I DON'T
UNDERSTAND

30:45.470 --> 30:47.670
WHY Y'ALL AREN'T
MORE PISSED OFF.

30:47.670 --> 30:50.270
COMING FROM THE COACH
WHO WALKED OUT ON US.

30:52.140 --> 30:55.010
THAT WAS A MISTAKE.

30:55.010 --> 30:57.650
THAT WAS MY MISTAKE
AND, UH,

30:57.650 --> 31:00.120
AND I'M SORRY I WASN'T
THERE FOR YOU ALL.

31:00.120 --> 31:04.350
I WAS GOING THROUGH SOME
PERSONAL ISSUES, AND I--
I GUESS I LOST MY WAY.

31:04.350 --> 31:07.460
I'M NOT GONNA ACT
LIKE IT'S NOT A BIG DEAL
BECAUSE I KNOW IT IS,

31:07.460 --> 31:10.730
BUT THAT'S STILL
NO EXCUSE FOR HOW Y'ALL
PLAYED OUT THERE.

31:10.730 --> 31:13.730
Y'ALL THINK Y'ALL
ARE BIG SHOTS BECAUSE
YOU WON STATE?

31:13.730 --> 31:17.730

YOU'RE GONNA PLAY.

31:17.730 --> 31:19.970
THIS 7-ON-7 LEAGUE

31:19.970 --> 31:22.370

THE BEST, Y'ALL.

31:22.370 --> 31:24.240

31:24.240 --> 31:26.640
BOOSTERS, SCOUTS.

31:26.640 --> 31:29.480
YOU DON'T KNOW WHO'S
GONNA SHOW UP.

31:29.480 --> 31:32.480
YOU DON'T KNOW.

31:32.480 --> 31:36.320
SO...TWO-A-DAYS.

31:36.320 --> 31:39.090
PRACTICES, TWO A DAY,

31:39.090 --> 31:42.660
AND I WANT TO SEE HUSTLE
IN EVERY STEP YOU TAKE.

31:42.660 --> 31:44.990
IF I SEE YOU WALK SLOW
BY ME IN THE HALL,

31:44.990 --> 31:47.600
BEST BELIEVE I'M GONNA MAKE YOU
DROP AND GIVE ME 20.

31:47.600 --> 31:49.460

32:19.290 --> 32:21.730
EMMA: ALL RIGHT, THE RAFFLE
WAS A HUGE SUCCESS,

32:21.730 --> 32:24.630
DESPITE A FEW
KEY ABSENCES.

32:26.570 --> 32:28.640
OK, UH, MOVING ON
TO OTHER ISSUES,

32:28.640 --> 32:30.640

32:39.110 --> 32:41.050
EMMA: LAYLA?

32:41.050 --> 32:43.190
LAYLA?

32:43.190 --> 32:45.190

32:45.190 --> 32:47.460
WHAT DO YOU THINK?

32:47.460 --> 32:50.090

32:50.090 --> 32:52.590
UH, UM, YOU--YOU
DON'T CARE ABOUT WHAT?

32:52.590 --> 32:54.130

IT'S ALL SUPERFICIAL
B.S. AND I DON'T CARE.

32:56.770 --> 32:59.600
SO ENJOY
YOUR STUPID TOFU
AND WASH IT DOWN

32:59.600 --> 33:02.140
WITH WHATEVER
UNFILTERED CRAP COMES
OUT OF THE FOUNTAIN.

33:02.140 --> 33:04.110
WHERE ARE YOU GOING?

33:04.110 --> 33:06.610
WASN'T IT OBVIOUS?

33:06.610 --> 33:09.410
CONGRATULATIONS, EMMA.

PRESIDENT.

33:09.410 --> 33:11.950

FOR THE NEXT MONTH--
YOU CAN TAKE THE BUS--

33:35.970 --> 33:38.240

33:38.240 --> 33:39.740

33:39.740 --> 33:42.640
OLIVIA: OOH.
#GROUNDED, HUH?

33:42.640 --> 33:44.450
TOO BAD YOU CAN'T POST

33:44.450 --> 33:46.580

THE ONLY ONE, OK?

33:59.330 --> 34:02.230
AND THIS BEHAVIOR
HAS GOT TO STOP.

34:02.230 --> 34:05.030
SO FROM NOW ON,
YOUR LIFE CONSISTS
OF GOING TO SCHOOL,

34:05.030 --> 34:09.040
FOOTBALL PRACTICE,
AND COMING HOME
AND THAT'S IT.

34:09.040 --> 34:11.270

-OH, THAT'S RIGHT.

35:41.960 --> 35:45.430
HE'S NOT YOUR ACTUAL
SON, HE'S JUST A KID
