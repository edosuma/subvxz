( taps )

00:45.629 --> 00:47.061
I'm sorry to bother you,

00:47.095 --> 00:48.831
but we're the people
who paid for your meal,

00:48.866 --> 00:51.636
and as much as I am committed
to you enjoying your food

00:51.671 --> 00:53.444
while it's still piping hot,

00:53.479 --> 00:55.680
I do have a few more
questions, if you don't mind.

00:55.714 --> 00:57.913
I'll give you
the $3.10 back.

00:57.948 --> 00:59.819
I have to beat my husband home.

00:59.853 --> 01:01.557
Would your husband be
happy if you were late,

01:01.591 --> 01:03.894
but had another $10?

01:03.928 --> 01:06.165
Well, I guess it would help.

01:07.437 --> 01:08.877
Good evening, ma'am.

01:08.911 --> 01:10.048
What's your name, little girl?

01:10.082 --> 01:12.751
It's Stacy.
Is that your question?

01:12.785 --> 01:15.286
Would you say that you eat
here weekly, monthly?

01:15.320 --> 01:17.928
Too much.

01:17.962 --> 01:20.302
What's your favorite
thing about Burger Chef?

01:20.337 --> 01:22.073
The taste or the price?

01:22.107 --> 01:24.676
- It's near my house.
- Convenience.

01:24.711 --> 01:26.714
Usually.

01:27.817 --> 01:29.590
Does your husband
ever pick it up?

01:29.624 --> 01:33.229
Oh, he wouldn't do that. It's bad
enough that I'm not making dinner.

01:33.263 --> 01:35.536
Is that all?

01:39.915 --> 01:42.285
Come back soon.

01:45.492 --> 01:47.958
How much money do you have?

01:47.992 --> 01:51.164
Two more families
and Chinese for us.

01:59.503 --> 02:02.174
It's not a listing.
It's Sybil's apartment.

02:03.143 --> 02:04.875
I'm not squatting.

02:04.909 --> 02:06.508
I can afford a hotel.

02:06.542 --> 02:08.676
It's seven nights.

02:10.616 --> 02:12.586
I'm not paying for it, <i>bonita</i>.

02:14.087 --> 02:16.020
Let me at least pay for
the theater tickets.

02:16.054 --> 02:17.687
I get them for free.

02:17.721 --> 02:20.391
Well, I'm going to buy you a
pair of loafers on Fifth Avenue.

02:20.425 --> 02:23.928
I want you shopping all day...

02:23.963 --> 02:26.900
and screwing all night.

02:26.934 --> 02:28.971
You'll spend the weekend
with me, won't you?

02:29.005 --> 02:30.706
I will need to spend

02:30.741 --> 02:33.876
some of Saturday
afternoon in Cos Cob.

02:33.910 --> 02:35.778
Well, I'll come.

02:35.813 --> 02:37.582
Why would you want to do that?

02:37.617 --> 02:40.118
I sure would like
to meet Tammy.

02:40.152 --> 02:41.786
I picked out her Barbie.

02:41.821 --> 02:44.557
I don't want
to confuse her, baby.

02:44.591 --> 02:46.060
She's probably more confused

02:46.094 --> 02:47.996
that her parents
aren't actually divorced.

02:48.430 --> 02:51.064
So that's something
that bothers you.

02:52.366 --> 02:54.802
Of course it bothers me.

02:56.174 --> 02:58.477
I don't know
where this is going,

02:58.511 --> 03:00.678
but I don't want it to
fail on account of delay.

03:02.013 --> 03:04.048
I haven't seen her in a while.

03:04.083 --> 03:06.988
Next time...
I promise.

03:09.792 --> 03:12.127
I thought you were never
going to get married again.

03:22.277 --> 03:24.546
Meet me in the restroom
in 60 seconds.

03:25.748 --> 03:28.884
I've always wanted to do that.

03:51.247 --> 03:53.914
( TV playing )

03:57.751 --> 04:00.152
- Aren't you going to eat?
- I'll have a roll at the office.

04:00.186 --> 04:01.785
Well, you're disappearing.

04:03.120 --> 04:04.721
Every time you say
something like that,

04:04.756 --> 04:06.323
I go off my diet.

04:08.327 --> 04:09.662
( TV off )

04:09.696 --> 04:11.964
Go outdoors today, please.

04:13.901 --> 04:16.137
( clicking )

04:17.841 --> 04:20.608
I hope I'm not interrupting?
It's Bonnie.

04:21.675 --> 04:23.074
I remember you.

04:23.109 --> 04:25.044
You can't just walk in here.

04:25.079 --> 04:27.313
Bonnie, this is Meredith.

04:27.347 --> 04:30.249
Do you want me to come and
get you in five minutes?

04:30.283 --> 04:32.253
Meredith, that'll be all.

04:34.656 --> 04:37.627
Pete's having quite a homecoming,
so I thought I'd duck in.

04:37.661 --> 04:39.295
You're the only one
I know here.

04:39.329 --> 04:41.029
How long are you in town?

04:41.063 --> 04:43.365
I hate to say it, but I
knew where to find you.

04:43.400 --> 04:45.768
- Don, how are you?
- Good to see you.

04:45.802 --> 04:48.136
I like what you've
done with the place.

04:48.171 --> 04:49.803
I heard you have
quite the home.

04:49.838 --> 04:51.371
Pete says it's
2,000 square feet.

04:51.406 --> 04:53.307
Not quite.

04:53.741 --> 04:57.146
Peggy's going to be leading us
through the work, as it were.

04:57.180 --> 04:58.814
I assume you're attending?

04:58.849 --> 05:01.482
- Burger Chef?
- You're on the team.

05:01.516 --> 05:02.983
I'd like you to be there.

05:05.020 --> 05:06.987
I guess this is my cue.

05:07.022 --> 05:09.321
Baloney. Walk me to
the conference room.

05:09.356 --> 05:11.156
He wants to make sure
everyone's seen you.

05:11.191 --> 05:13.058
( chuckles )

05:14.060 --> 05:16.296
- Ta-ta.
- Very well.

05:20.035 --> 05:22.001
Is this the billboard?

05:22.036 --> 05:23.636
It's kind of lackluster.

05:23.670 --> 05:26.607
That's the tray liner.

05:26.642 --> 05:29.576
- That's everything, chief.
- Thank you, Stan.

05:33.245 --> 05:35.576
- Hello, Stan.
- Good to see you, Pete.

05:35.611 --> 05:36.709
How's life treating you?

05:36.744 --> 05:38.543
I'm in New York
and I'm in love.

05:38.577 --> 05:39.977
Me as well.

05:40.011 --> 05:42.345
Hello, Pete.

05:42.379 --> 05:46.181
Well, I think we should
get this started.

05:46.515 --> 05:48.183
Did you need something, Don?

05:48.217 --> 05:49.785
I've asked Don to join us.

05:51.855 --> 05:53.622
I didn't know
you wanted the team.

05:53.657 --> 05:54.789
Should we get Mathis as well?

05:54.824 --> 05:56.590
No, Don's plenty.

05:56.624 --> 05:58.660
Well, he has been instrumental.

06:04.399 --> 06:07.003
I think we're
circling a strategy--

06:07.037 --> 06:09.041
all the research
points to the fact

06:09.076 --> 06:11.578
that mothers feel guilty.

06:11.612 --> 06:13.344
They don't eat
at the restaurant

06:13.379 --> 06:15.413
because of what Mathis calls
a "cleanliness fetish."

06:15.447 --> 06:16.782
( chuckles )

06:16.816 --> 06:18.886
And even when they get home,
they're embarrassed.

06:18.920 --> 06:20.756
Our job is to turn Burger Chef

06:20.790 --> 06:23.124
into a special treat
served with love.

06:23.158 --> 06:24.993
So the more these women
go to Burger Chef,

06:25.027 --> 06:26.964
- the worse they feel.
- Yes.

06:26.998 --> 06:29.298
We need to address how to
give homemakers permission.

06:29.733 --> 06:31.932
Well, who gives
moms permission? Dads.

06:34.370 --> 06:37.541
It's a dark night.
Reveal our mom, driving,

06:37.576 --> 06:39.344
girl in a tutu next to her,

06:39.379 --> 06:41.212
boy wearing a football
helmet in the back.

06:41.246 --> 06:44.683
Push into a close-up
as we hear Mom's voice--

06:44.718 --> 06:46.520
the things on her mind.

06:46.554 --> 06:49.522
"Let's see, check that list for
the marching band fundraiser.

06:49.556 --> 06:51.591
Get the sink trap checked.

06:51.625 --> 06:53.728
Get Jim to take down
the storm windows.

06:54.263 --> 06:55.630
( gasps )
Jim!

06:55.664 --> 06:57.431
Jim will be home
in a half an hour."

06:57.465 --> 07:00.899
Just then the little
girl says, "I'm hungry."

07:00.933 --> 07:03.636
The boy says,
"I'm starving."

07:03.671 --> 07:06.438
Mom says,
"One more stop."

07:06.473 --> 07:09.040
We see the reflection
of the Burger Chef sign

07:09.075 --> 07:11.776
on the station wagon
windshield as she pulls in.

07:11.810 --> 07:14.045
Mom gets out of the car.

07:14.079 --> 07:17.180
A handsome man comes out
holding a bag.

07:17.213 --> 07:20.883
Mom walks up to him
and gives him a deep kiss.

07:20.918 --> 07:24.189
The kids in the car
looking surprised.

07:24.223 --> 07:26.957
He laughs and says,
"Can I take you to dinner?"

07:26.992 --> 07:30.093
She says, "Next time,
let me get dinner.

07:30.127 --> 07:31.730
You take down
the storm windows."

07:31.764 --> 07:33.700
( chuckling )

07:34.135 --> 07:35.802
Cut to them
at the kitchen table,

07:35.837 --> 07:38.838
camera moving from face
to smiling face.

07:38.872 --> 07:42.243
They're laughing,
Mom looks around, smiling.

07:42.277 --> 07:44.646
VO, "Aren't you glad

07:44.680 --> 07:47.148
everybody loves Burger Chef
as much as you do?"

07:48.748 --> 07:52.018
Very nice. I think
it's coming along.

07:52.053 --> 07:54.255
It's nice to see
family happiness again.

07:54.289 --> 07:56.288
Thank you.

07:58.326 --> 08:00.131
What do you think?

08:04.907 --> 08:08.208
Dad surprising the family
absolves the mom.

08:08.242 --> 08:10.777
It's right on strategy.
It's exactly what they wanted.

08:12.781 --> 08:15.251
Don worked the tag over
by the syllable.

08:15.286 --> 08:17.786
- It's deceptively simple.
- Thank you.

08:17.820 --> 08:19.219
Why don't you take us
through the legs?

08:19.253 --> 08:21.590
Let's start with radio.

08:24.262 --> 08:27.230
Looky here.
A sight for sore eyes.

08:28.232 --> 08:31.198
Ah...

08:31.232 --> 08:33.631
Hello, Jim.

08:33.666 --> 08:35.332
How's your Burger Chef
work going?

08:35.366 --> 08:37.001
Better than yours, I guess.

08:37.035 --> 08:39.703
Thank you, by the way, for failing
and giving us a shot at it.

08:39.736 --> 08:42.606
It's not McDonald's.
It's run by morons.

08:42.640 --> 08:44.442
A lot of companies
succeed that way.

08:44.476 --> 08:46.409
But look who I'm talking to.

08:46.444 --> 08:49.978
You don't mean that.
You're going after fast food,

08:50.013 --> 08:52.283
you've got
your little car--

08:52.317 --> 08:54.486
it's not Buick, but it's cute.

08:55.020 --> 08:57.786
I know you folks want to be just
like McCann when you grow up.

08:57.820 --> 09:00.754
When we grow up, we're going to
kill you and marry your wife.

09:00.789 --> 09:04.293
( chuckles ) Listen, I hear
you're talking to Philip Morris.

09:04.327 --> 09:06.394
Is Leo Burnett in here, too?

09:06.428 --> 09:08.365
Well, I'm just curious how you think
you're going to pull that off

09:08.399 --> 09:10.267
with Don Draper
haunting your halls.

09:10.302 --> 09:12.635
( sighs )

09:12.670 --> 09:15.136
You're so lucky my problems
aren't your problems.

09:15.570 --> 09:18.140
What if I wanted them to be?

09:18.174 --> 09:19.775
Are you looking for a job?

09:19.809 --> 09:22.909
No. No.
I'm just looking

09:22.943 --> 09:25.645
to enrich the lives
of people I respect.

09:27.180 --> 09:28.846
The New York Athletic Club
frowns on people

09:28.881 --> 09:30.948
making advances
in their steam room.

09:33.386 --> 09:35.353
I was kidding around,

09:35.387 --> 09:37.223
but I think you're
making eyes at me.

09:39.228 --> 09:41.630
I'm gonna go get a massage,
relieve some of this tension.

09:41.664 --> 09:44.900
Fellas, we got a live one here.

09:49.339 --> 09:51.407
Come in, join us

09:51.441 --> 09:53.843
I'm drinking rum.
Do you want some?

09:53.878 --> 09:57.682
- No, thank you.
- That bar, it's hysterical.

09:57.716 --> 09:59.818
My wife's a card.

09:59.853 --> 10:02.355
I'm very pleased with the
direction I saw this morning.

10:02.390 --> 10:04.956
- We all are.
- Thank you.

10:04.991 --> 10:07.859
And-- not but--

10:07.893 --> 10:09.993
I think with my understanding
of George Payton,

10:10.027 --> 10:13.926
that our success would
be further assured

10:13.961 --> 10:16.163
if Don delivered
the presentation.

10:16.198 --> 10:18.866
- Oh.
- Here's the but.

10:18.901 --> 10:21.634
It is completely your decision.

10:21.668 --> 10:24.536
Why are you doing this now?

10:24.971 --> 10:27.374
That's what I said.
She's doing fine.

10:27.408 --> 10:31.108
Lou, first of all, you've
never seen Don at his best.

10:31.143 --> 10:33.246
It'll be a tearjerker.

10:33.280 --> 10:36.348
Number two is Peggy, in my
mind, will still speak,

10:36.382 --> 10:39.514
but as the mother.
A change of tone.

10:39.548 --> 10:40.915
You were wonderful in there.

10:42.617 --> 10:44.317
I don't like
being in this position.

10:44.352 --> 10:46.352
I know I can bring this home.

10:46.387 --> 10:49.454
Peggy, you didn't walk into
this office and see Don here.

10:49.488 --> 10:50.855
This is your client,

10:50.889 --> 10:53.323
and you're going to write as
much of it as you want to.

10:53.858 --> 10:56.758
Don will give authority,
you will give emotion.

10:56.793 --> 10:59.593
I have authority.
And Don has emotion.

10:59.627 --> 11:02.163
I prefer you
as an expert witness.

11:02.197 --> 11:05.034
- You will introduce him.
- Intercom: <i>But it's your decision.</i>

11:05.068 --> 11:07.103
- What?
- <i> It's Ted.</i>

11:07.138 --> 11:08.906
Ted's on the phone.

11:08.940 --> 11:11.076
Oh.

11:11.110 --> 11:12.678
Hello.

11:12.713 --> 11:14.717
I've seen the work so far.
I'm impressed.

11:14.751 --> 11:16.351
And what would <i> you</i> do?

11:16.385 --> 11:19.454
I would use everything
at my disposal to win it.

11:25.163 --> 11:27.397
If you think George Payton
will prefer it,

11:27.431 --> 11:29.501
I'm not going to ignore that.

11:29.535 --> 11:31.572
You know that she's
every bit as good

11:31.607 --> 11:33.509
as any woman in this business!

11:33.544 --> 11:35.676
I do.

11:39.046 --> 11:41.046
He'll be great.

11:43.682 --> 11:46.152
Keep up the good work.

11:53.725 --> 11:56.925
It's big and powerful and costs a
fortune, but it can't make coffee.

11:56.959 --> 11:58.593
They've got a computer
twice that size

11:58.627 --> 12:01.394
working on the
engine for the XP.

12:01.428 --> 12:03.961
- Clara?
- Nice to see you, Mr. Benson.

12:03.996 --> 12:06.294
Gentlemen, there's coffee and
cake in Mr. Crane's office.

12:06.328 --> 12:08.329
May I take your hats?

12:08.364 --> 12:10.332
Hey, fellas.

12:10.366 --> 12:12.200
Jack, Bill, nice to see you.

12:12.234 --> 12:14.702
- Hello, Kenny.
- How's the kid? Is he flying yet?

12:14.737 --> 12:16.869
Are you kidding? He's
crawling all over the place.

12:16.903 --> 12:18.571
You've really got
to keep an eye on him.

12:20.474 --> 12:22.775
Joan!
Come say hello.

12:22.809 --> 12:25.909
Welcome back, Bob.
Gentlemen.

12:25.944 --> 12:28.114
How the hell did we end up
with him instead of you?

12:28.148 --> 12:31.151
- No one asked.
- This is Bill Hartley.

12:31.185 --> 12:33.086
Bill's been bumped
to vice president of brand.

12:33.120 --> 12:34.454
Congratulations.

12:34.489 --> 12:36.291
You certainly picked the
right place to celebrate.

12:36.325 --> 12:39.094
You mean New York City
or this very spot?

12:39.128 --> 12:40.729
( laughs )

12:40.764 --> 12:42.099
So far all we have lined up

12:42.133 --> 12:43.533
is six hours of network pilots.

12:43.568 --> 12:46.102
Clara, could you take
them to Harry's office?

12:46.137 --> 12:48.471
- Enjoy.
- Very funny.

12:48.505 --> 12:50.406
Pleasure, ma'am.

12:51.408 --> 12:53.208
I'd love to see you Sunday.

12:53.243 --> 12:55.942
Unless you've made plans
with some married guy.

12:55.977 --> 12:58.914
I am all yours.

12:58.948 --> 13:01.550
But if you want to see Kevin, you're
going to have to see my mother.

13:01.584 --> 13:04.217
I want to see everyone.

13:12.924 --> 13:15.760
- You need something?
- Yes, actually, I do.

13:16.795 --> 13:18.496
I've given it careful thought,

13:18.531 --> 13:21.199
and I think you should give the
presentation to Burger Chef.

13:21.234 --> 13:23.936
Hold on.

13:23.970 --> 13:25.371
You did a great job
this morning.

13:25.405 --> 13:28.208
That's good to hear,
but I want to have

13:28.242 --> 13:29.677
the best chance
of winning this,

13:29.711 --> 13:31.846
and I'm not going to
pretend you're not it.

13:31.881 --> 13:35.215
- Whose idea was this?
- Mine.

13:35.250 --> 13:37.916
I'll introduce you, and
when you're rounding third,

13:37.950 --> 13:40.150
you hand it off
to "the voice of moms."

13:40.183 --> 13:43.421
And then you turn and hit the tag
like you just thought of it.

13:43.455 --> 13:46.423
- Do I do that?
- Yes, you do.

13:48.158 --> 13:51.090
- Whatever you want.
- That's what I want.

13:51.125 --> 13:53.256
Thank you.

13:54.757 --> 13:57.526
You know, I was just noodling
around with the idea

13:57.560 --> 13:59.894
of seeing the whole thing
from the kids' perspective.

13:59.928 --> 14:03.064
- "Mom, can we go to Burger Chef?"
- Excuse me?

14:03.099 --> 14:04.534
I don't know.
Just a thought.

14:06.069 --> 14:08.668
I appreciate it, but we
already have a strategy.

14:10.104 --> 14:11.838
<i>( door closes )</i>

14:16.877 --> 14:18.745
Megan?

14:18.779 --> 14:20.646
Hello!

14:23.549 --> 14:25.284
Oh, I'm sorry.

14:25.719 --> 14:27.120
Why didn't you say something?

14:27.154 --> 14:29.654
No, Marsha, this is
Megan, Don's wife.

14:29.689 --> 14:31.622
I didn't know he was married.

14:32.825 --> 14:35.258
So nice to meet you.

14:35.293 --> 14:37.094
Marsha, can you
get Megan some coffee?

14:37.128 --> 14:39.997
I'm fine.

14:40.031 --> 14:42.333
This is very impressive,
but where do you work now?

14:42.367 --> 14:44.669
My office is right here.

14:46.739 --> 14:49.344
- Are you a surprise?
- No, he's expecting me.

14:49.378 --> 14:52.080
Well, you're a surprise for me.

14:52.115 --> 14:53.983
How is everything in LA?

14:54.017 --> 14:57.325
It's exciting
and new and different.

14:57.359 --> 15:00.062
And a lot quieter.

15:00.096 --> 15:02.930
What a great office.

15:02.964 --> 15:05.532
Sooner or later you're going
to get Don's, aren't you?

15:05.566 --> 15:07.937
I don't know
how much better it is.

15:07.971 --> 15:10.071
He's right next door.

15:10.105 --> 15:12.639
Oh.

15:12.674 --> 15:14.207
Hey!

15:14.241 --> 15:16.209
I didn't expect to see you.

15:16.243 --> 15:19.080
- Peggy: Megan's in for a visit.
- Thanks for the subtitles.

15:19.114 --> 15:22.047
- Did you hear about Ginsberg?
- Yes. Have you seen him?

15:22.081 --> 15:24.415
I did.
She won't go.

15:24.449 --> 15:25.984
Don: <i>All right,
Meredith, I'm gonna go.</i>

15:26.018 --> 15:28.218
Don?

15:28.753 --> 15:30.185
What are you doing here?

15:30.220 --> 15:32.018
I couldn't wait to see you.

15:32.053 --> 15:33.886
I thought
we could eat downtown.

15:33.920 --> 15:36.021
That's a great idea.

15:38.091 --> 15:40.759
Well, it was so great
to see you both.

15:40.793 --> 15:42.695
Is it okay?
I have a visitor.

15:42.729 --> 15:44.628
Enjoy yourself.

15:44.662 --> 15:47.228
Good night.

15:53.233 --> 15:54.633
I miss her.

15:54.668 --> 15:57.272
You didn't even ask me
how the dry run went.

15:57.307 --> 15:59.007
Was there a problem?

15:59.042 --> 16:01.575
No, they loved it.

16:01.609 --> 16:03.810
Are you mad at me?

16:03.844 --> 16:07.049
No.
Good night, Stan.

16:08.350 --> 16:10.751
Good night.

16:17.365 --> 16:19.165
Ah, good, you're still here.

16:19.200 --> 16:20.833
That's your opinion.

16:20.867 --> 16:23.134
I played a round this
morning with Les Clark--

16:23.169 --> 16:24.869
my friend from Philip Morris?

16:24.904 --> 16:27.138
The brand commander
of Commander brand.

16:27.172 --> 16:29.473
Your name came up
and I sure would appreciate

16:29.508 --> 16:31.609
you helping us pave that road.

16:31.643 --> 16:33.812
Your secret plan
to win the war?

16:33.846 --> 16:36.118
Stop thinking about Don

16:36.153 --> 16:38.456
and start thinking
about the company.

16:41.491 --> 16:43.625
( ringing )

16:58.333 --> 16:59.933
Who's here for William Hartley?

17:01.766 --> 17:03.465
- Bill?
- Don't say anything.

17:03.500 --> 17:05.733
But you should say thank
you to your boyfriend

17:05.769 --> 17:07.736
- for posting bail.
- Has he seen a doctor?

17:07.770 --> 17:10.503
- What did I just say?
- Take him to a headshrinker.

17:10.538 --> 17:13.173
He tried to fellate
an undercover officer.

17:15.045 --> 17:17.645
May I go?

17:21.285 --> 17:23.520
Good night,
"ladies."

17:26.487 --> 17:29.557
<i>( distant siren wails )</i>

17:31.694 --> 17:34.360
I called you because
I knew you could keep this to yourself.

17:34.395 --> 17:37.265
You should go to the hospital.

17:37.299 --> 17:39.736
You know they're just
going to call the cops.

17:42.471 --> 17:45.038
( sighs ) I wish I
was back in Detroit.

17:45.072 --> 17:47.376
I've got that place wired.

17:48.613 --> 17:50.383
Have you ever been arrested?

17:50.417 --> 17:52.885
No.
Never.

17:54.056 --> 17:56.392
I guess you've been lucky.

17:58.396 --> 18:00.497
Well, I appreciate this.

18:00.531 --> 18:04.002
I'm going to miss
having you around.

18:04.036 --> 18:06.735
I am not of your stripe.

18:06.770 --> 18:10.206
And you should think twice before
you threaten me like that.

18:11.776 --> 18:14.375
Please.
I'm not threatening you.

18:17.012 --> 18:19.980
We're moving the XP over to
Campbell-Ewald, and you're moving on.

18:23.149 --> 18:24.918
- We're losing Chevy?
- Don't worry.

18:24.953 --> 18:27.752
GM loves the work,
and they really love you.

18:27.786 --> 18:29.352
Obviously not.

18:29.387 --> 18:31.655
Your agency had
a successful tryout,

18:31.690 --> 18:34.759
but the plan was always
to take the XP in-house.

18:36.861 --> 18:38.894
But Buick is going
to come to <i> you</i>

18:38.928 --> 18:40.961
with a great job offer.

18:41.996 --> 18:44.630
What?

18:46.933 --> 18:49.503
Well, that's very good news.

18:51.839 --> 18:55.612
- When does all this happen?
- Imminently.

18:57.549 --> 18:59.480
What about you?

18:59.515 --> 19:01.582
I'm gonna call in sick.

19:01.616 --> 19:04.454
My wife understands, thank God.

19:06.692 --> 19:09.194
That's a good idea.

19:12.665 --> 19:15.536
How did you live in this city?

19:15.571 --> 19:18.709
There's so much temptation.

19:20.044 --> 19:22.282
It was hard.

19:55.693 --> 19:57.758
( sighs )

20:05.548 --> 20:08.120
( birds chirping )

20:10.355 --> 20:12.988
Hello?

20:13.022 --> 20:14.756
Trudy?

20:14.791 --> 20:17.026
Come along, let's go say hi.

20:17.997 --> 20:20.467
Hello, sweetie.

20:22.469 --> 20:24.101
It's Daddy, sweetheart.

20:26.271 --> 20:29.074
I got you a Barbie all
the way from California.

20:30.475 --> 20:32.442
Go ahead.

20:36.042 --> 20:38.009
I don't believe we've met.

20:38.544 --> 20:40.746
- Where's Trudy?
- She's at the hairdresser.

20:40.781 --> 20:42.115
I'm Verna.

20:42.150 --> 20:45.752
Well, Verna's going to
come with us to the car.

21:27.526 --> 21:30.296
Tell me it was all a dream.

21:30.331 --> 21:32.565
You're in a good mood.

21:32.599 --> 21:35.235
Tell me you didn't miss this.

21:36.573 --> 21:38.876
I missed you.

21:42.444 --> 21:45.313
Well, we're going to eat
this delicious breakfast,

21:46.649 --> 21:49.183
and I'm going
to take you shopping.

21:49.218 --> 21:51.620
Okay.

22:17.651 --> 22:20.148
( ringing )

22:20.682 --> 22:22.181
Hey, baby, I'm almost ready.

22:22.216 --> 22:24.919
"Hi, baby" yourself. I've
been here since 10:00.

22:24.953 --> 22:28.322
- Oh, it's you.
- Are you coming in?

22:28.356 --> 22:30.190
Find something else to do today.
That's an order.

22:30.224 --> 22:32.923
I don't like the idea.

22:32.957 --> 22:34.289
Of doing something else?

22:34.324 --> 22:36.823
No, the idea for Burger Chef.

22:36.857 --> 22:39.359
You haven't been "noodling"
with anything else, have you?

22:39.394 --> 22:42.364
It came easy.
You don't trust it.

22:42.399 --> 22:45.635
- It didn't come easy at all.
- So find a new one.

22:46.637 --> 22:48.471
So <i> you</i> don't like it either.

22:48.505 --> 22:49.972
The work is great!

22:50.006 --> 22:52.172
I'm positive,
exclamation point!

22:52.706 --> 22:54.639
How do I know you're not
just saying that

22:54.674 --> 22:56.106
so you don't have to come in?

22:56.141 --> 22:58.006
( sighs )

22:58.040 --> 22:59.973
Do you need me to come in?

23:01.409 --> 23:03.376
No.

23:03.410 --> 23:05.376
Your "baby's" calling.

23:06.511 --> 23:08.310
But we both know
there's a better idea.

23:08.345 --> 23:11.383
There's always a better idea.

23:11.417 --> 23:13.184
Bye.

23:16.421 --> 23:19.187
<i>( TV playing )</i>

23:22.324 --> 23:24.791
Look at you.

23:24.826 --> 23:26.994
You say goodbye to your daddy, and
then you're going to take a bath.

23:27.029 --> 23:29.331
- Where's Trudy?
- She's out, Mr. Campbell.

23:29.365 --> 23:31.534
Her car's in the drive.

23:31.569 --> 23:34.675
Well, she came back,
but then she went out.

23:37.080 --> 23:39.382
Why don't you give Tammy a
bath and let me tuck her in?

23:39.416 --> 23:41.620
Of course,
Mr. Campbell.

23:45.660 --> 23:47.628
( ringing )

23:50.101 --> 23:52.137
- Hello?
- Hello, dear.

23:52.172 --> 23:54.239
I'm afraid I've been
waylaid in Cos Cob.

23:54.274 --> 23:57.444
You go without me. I'll pick
you up for a drink after.

23:57.479 --> 24:00.846
You really want me to see "Oh!
Calcutta!" by myself?

24:00.880 --> 24:03.649
Trudy must've forgotten.

24:04.819 --> 24:07.188
There's no one
to look after Tammy.

24:08.189 --> 24:09.756
Oh.

24:09.790 --> 24:11.459
That's rather
inconsiderate, isn't it?

24:11.496 --> 24:14.467
I'm sure it's just a mistake.

24:15.869 --> 24:18.137
Well, I'm going to wait
until the very last minute.

24:19.373 --> 24:21.871
That's sweet.
I'll make it up to you.

24:21.905 --> 24:24.208
You most certainly will.

24:24.242 --> 24:25.778
<i>( line clicks )</i>

24:33.788 --> 24:35.488

- It's not for me.

24:42.565 --> 24:44.531
- Hello?
- Oh, I'm glad I caught you.

24:44.565 --> 24:47.834
- Are you on your way out?
- Just sitting down to dinner.

24:47.868 --> 24:50.774
Well, it's just--

24:50.808 --> 24:52.408
I just wanted to let you know

24:52.442 --> 24:53.909
that I tried your
"kids' point of view" idea,

24:53.943 --> 24:55.244
and it's not good.

24:55.279 --> 24:56.646
( chuckles )

24:56.681 --> 24:58.717
Well, it was great
hearing from you.

24:58.751 --> 25:01.583
It's just I know,
now that you're presenting,

25:01.617 --> 25:03.251
you're prone to more
serious thought,

25:03.285 --> 25:05.189
and I just wanted you
to know that one's a loser.

25:05.223 --> 25:08.025
I'm always working, Peggy.
So are you.

25:09.593 --> 25:11.496
Why are you undermining me?

25:11.531 --> 25:14.469
From now on
I won't express myself.

25:14.504 --> 25:16.737
Well, now it's tainted.

25:16.771 --> 25:19.537
It's poisoned, because you
expressed yourself.

25:19.572 --> 25:22.109
If you don't want to
do it, don't do it.

25:32.890 --> 25:34.624
Did you lose your appetite?

25:34.659 --> 25:36.825
Absolutely not.

25:47.570 --> 25:50.106
Oh, hello.

25:50.140 --> 25:51.608
Did you just get back?

25:51.643 --> 25:53.579
No, but you did.

25:53.613 --> 25:55.478
Is Tammy still up?

25:55.513 --> 25:59.117
No. We said
our good nights.

25:59.551 --> 26:02.954
Verna's back there
hiding somewhere.

26:04.122 --> 26:07.725
Well, did you have a nice time?

26:07.760 --> 26:10.161
I was in fine spirits

26:10.195 --> 26:12.597
until I thought
about you pulled over

26:12.631 --> 26:15.199
on the side of the road
necking with Charlie Fiddich.

26:15.233 --> 26:19.036
- Charlie Fiddich?
- Well, who was it, then?

26:19.070 --> 26:20.640
Or are you going to keep
it a secret from me

26:20.674 --> 26:22.777
like your father's
heart attack?

26:22.811 --> 26:24.411
You've seen your
daughter for the year.

26:24.445 --> 26:25.779
Don't you have
a plane to catch?

26:25.813 --> 26:28.484
I don't like you carrying on like this.
It's immoral.

26:28.519 --> 26:31.555
- You have a child.
- What?!

26:32.958 --> 26:35.630
You picked tonight
for your date?

26:37.201 --> 26:38.938
You still care about me.

26:38.973 --> 26:41.407
I know your
debutante maneuvers.

26:41.442 --> 26:44.043
We're getting a divorce.

26:44.078 --> 26:45.845
We're still married.

26:45.879 --> 26:49.549
You're not part of
this family anymore.

26:58.463 --> 27:00.464
Good night.

27:03.001 --> 27:04.970
<i>( door closes )</i>

27:08.142 --> 27:09.976
( doorbell dings )

27:11.676 --> 27:14.977
- ( Kevin coos )
- Well, hello there.

27:17.148 --> 27:20.884
Well, hello yourself.
Somebody missed you.

27:22.153 --> 27:23.987
You're early, but welcome.

27:24.021 --> 27:26.322
These are for you.

27:26.356 --> 27:30.761
And <i> that</i> is for you.

27:30.795 --> 27:34.131
- Wow.
- It's an Erector Set.

27:34.165 --> 27:35.599
America needs engineers.

27:35.633 --> 27:37.402
What do you say to Uncle Bob?

27:37.436 --> 27:39.572
Thank you.

27:39.606 --> 27:41.207
I know everybody got something,

27:41.241 --> 27:42.475
but I was shopping in Midtown

27:42.509 --> 27:44.143
all day yesterday
and I struck out.

27:44.177 --> 27:46.945
The Jews close
everything on Saturday.

27:46.980 --> 27:48.447
I'm starving.

27:48.481 --> 27:50.782
I see a day that
starts with pancakes

27:50.816 --> 27:52.383
and ends with
an ice cream sundae.

27:52.418 --> 27:53.885
Should I bring the stroller?

27:53.919 --> 27:56.122
I'll carry him if I have to.

27:56.156 --> 27:58.359
Let me get my bag.

28:01.681 --> 28:04.365
_

28:14.145 --> 28:15.912
What are you looking for?

28:15.947 --> 28:18.317
Oh, good morning.

28:18.351 --> 28:20.585
The fondue pot.
It's not in the kitchen.

28:20.619 --> 28:22.221
Coffee's fine.

28:22.255 --> 28:26.360
No, I thought it would
get some use out there.

28:26.394 --> 28:29.029
I thought you just
needed summer clothes.

28:31.066 --> 28:33.170
I miss my things.

28:39.804 --> 28:42.175
You were dead to the world.

28:42.210 --> 28:44.343
I sleep better
when you're here.

28:44.377 --> 28:47.513
Oh, I miss you, too.

28:47.547 --> 28:50.085
I'm sorry the visit's so short.

28:53.921 --> 28:56.586
Can I just check this
in on the plane?

28:56.620 --> 28:58.455
How much is there?
I can take some.

28:58.489 --> 29:00.123
When?

29:00.558 --> 29:03.359
The next time I come.
End of July.

29:06.230 --> 29:09.031
You know what?

29:09.065 --> 29:10.799
I want to see you somewhere

29:10.833 --> 29:13.335
where there's
nothing else going on.

29:13.369 --> 29:16.106
Not LA.
Not here.

29:16.140 --> 29:18.176
Just us.

29:19.612 --> 29:20.945
That'd be nice.

29:35.724 --> 29:38.523
( TV playing )

29:44.296 --> 29:46.430
Air-conditioning.

29:46.464 --> 29:48.700
Delicious.

29:48.734 --> 29:51.503
- Did you have fun?
- You ate already?

29:51.537 --> 29:53.672
I'm sorry, I was hungry.

29:53.706 --> 29:55.038
I can eat again.

29:55.073 --> 29:57.742
Look at these feet.

29:57.776 --> 30:00.077
I wore my sandals
and I look like a hobo.

30:00.112 --> 30:02.046
My toenails are black.

30:02.080 --> 30:03.981
You can't wear
those in the city.

30:04.015 --> 30:05.716
You might as well be barefoot.

30:05.750 --> 30:08.085
Will you try on your wares?
Slowly?

30:08.119 --> 30:10.155
Well, at least
you're in a better mood.

30:10.189 --> 30:12.760
Come over here.

30:18.300 --> 30:20.035
Did you get your work done?

30:20.069 --> 30:22.203
Some of it.

30:24.406 --> 30:26.676
Well, this is my vacation,

30:26.710 --> 30:29.445
and I knew you were
going to the office,

30:29.479 --> 30:30.846
but the first Saturday
we spent here,

30:30.880 --> 30:32.145
you needed to see
your daughter.

30:32.179 --> 30:34.180
Then you didn't come home,

30:34.214 --> 30:37.018
which I understand
was Trudy's fault.

30:37.053 --> 30:40.018
Then you were grumpy.
Okay.

30:40.053 --> 30:42.387
Then I amused myself
all morning,

30:42.422 --> 30:44.389
and when I come back,
you ordered room service?

30:44.423 --> 30:46.756
I'm inundated, sweetheart.

30:46.791 --> 30:48.624
I don't like you in New York.

30:48.659 --> 30:51.794
Well, then you don't like me.

30:51.828 --> 30:53.862
You're not going to
fuck your way out of this.

30:53.896 --> 30:55.196
What?

30:55.231 --> 30:57.601
I'm going to wash my feet.

31:06.143 --> 31:08.311
How's it going?

31:08.345 --> 31:09.978
( huffs )

31:17.021 --> 31:19.420
Did you park your
white horse outside?

31:19.454 --> 31:23.992
Spare me the suspense and tell me
what your "save the day" plan is.

31:24.026 --> 31:25.858
I don't have anything yet.

31:25.892 --> 31:27.460
The idea I had wasn't great.

31:27.495 --> 31:29.196
It wasn't great.
It was terrible.

31:29.230 --> 31:30.797
I want to hear the real one.

31:30.831 --> 31:33.498
Or are you just going to pull
it out during the presentation?

31:33.532 --> 31:35.602
This idea is good.

31:35.636 --> 31:37.171
I think we can get
the client to buy it.

31:37.205 --> 31:40.172
No, you don't, or you
wouldn't have questioned it.

31:42.007 --> 31:43.641
I'm going to do
whatever you say.

31:43.675 --> 31:46.545
So you're going to pitch the
hell out of my shitty idea,

31:46.579 --> 31:48.079
and I'm going to fail.

31:48.114 --> 31:49.913
Peggy, I'm here to help you do

31:49.947 --> 31:51.313
whatever you want to do.

31:51.348 --> 31:54.085
Well, how am I
supposed to know?

31:57.122 --> 31:58.588
That's a tough one.

31:58.622 --> 32:01.525
- You love this.
- Not really.

32:02.828 --> 32:04.627
I want you to feel good
about what you're doing,

32:04.661 --> 32:07.765
but you'll never <i> know.</i>
That's just the job.

32:07.799 --> 32:09.533
What's the job?

32:09.568 --> 32:12.368
Living in
the "not knowing."

32:14.038 --> 32:16.007
You know, I wouldn't have
argued if it was me.

32:16.042 --> 32:18.612
I would have just given
you a hundred ideas

32:18.646 --> 32:21.382
and never questioned why.

32:21.416 --> 32:23.084
You really want to help me?

32:23.119 --> 32:25.319
Show me how you think.

32:25.354 --> 32:27.224
Do it out loud.

32:27.258 --> 32:29.294
You can't tell people
what they want.

32:29.328 --> 32:31.195
It has to be what <i> you</i> want.

32:33.862 --> 32:35.796
I want to go to the movies.

32:39.470 --> 32:42.404
I just came back from
"I Am Curious Yellow."

32:43.539 --> 32:45.507
I'm still scandalized.

32:45.541 --> 32:48.309
Of course Megan would want
to see a dirty movie.

32:48.344 --> 32:51.376
- Do you want to work?
- It doesn't matter if I want to.

32:51.410 --> 32:54.544
I have to, because
all of this is crap.

32:55.613 --> 32:57.847
Pros and cons.

32:57.881 --> 33:00.216
Pros--
it's almost done and it's good.

33:00.250 --> 33:03.219
The account man's overjoyed
and the client's on board.

33:04.622 --> 33:06.323
Those are the cons,
and you know it.

33:08.294 --> 33:10.462
Well...

33:12.165 --> 33:16.403
whenever I'm really
unsure about an idea,

33:16.437 --> 33:18.904
first...

33:18.939 --> 33:21.444
I abuse the people
whose help I need.

33:24.679 --> 33:27.048
And then I take a nap.

33:28.418 --> 33:29.788
Done.

33:29.822 --> 33:33.828
Then I start
at the beginning again...

33:35.598 --> 33:38.265
and see if I end up
in the same place.

33:40.333 --> 33:43.973
Mom's job is to make dinner.

33:44.008 --> 33:46.509
Burger Chef's job
is to stop her.

33:50.683 --> 33:54.048
What is it about that thing?
Little boys love it.

33:54.083 --> 33:56.617
<i>( "The End of a Party"</i>
<i>plays in background )</i>

34:01.158 --> 34:03.393
You're a very lucky person.

34:03.427 --> 34:05.328
Have I been
complaining too much?

34:05.363 --> 34:07.330
No.

34:07.365 --> 34:10.000
- Did Gail go to bed?
- She did.

34:15.540 --> 34:18.944
( sighs ) I know I
shouldn't be saying this,

34:18.978 --> 34:21.681
because my heart is pounding.

34:21.716 --> 34:24.184
What?

34:24.217 --> 34:27.353
I know I said I didn't
get you anything...

34:30.092 --> 34:31.661
but I did.

34:36.231 --> 34:37.664
Bob, put that away.

34:37.697 --> 34:40.266
I know I should have done
this a long time ago.

34:40.300 --> 34:42.869
Did I miss my chance?

34:44.971 --> 34:46.902
No.

34:47.904 --> 34:50.205
I don't know.

34:50.239 --> 34:52.341
So you don't feel
anything for me?

34:52.375 --> 34:54.275
My face doesn't please you?

34:54.309 --> 34:56.742
I don't believe it.

35:07.821 --> 35:09.121
You don't want this.

35:09.155 --> 35:11.923
You're not listening to me.

35:11.957 --> 35:14.692
Bob...

35:16.561 --> 35:18.362
you shouldn't be with a woman.

35:23.303 --> 35:25.571
I have been, you know.

35:27.007 --> 35:29.008
Why are you doing this now?

35:31.314 --> 35:34.214
Well, honestly,

35:34.248 --> 35:36.080
I'm moving on to Buick.

35:37.382 --> 35:40.255
And GM expects a certain
kind of executive.

35:40.589 --> 35:43.759
- You're leaving the agency?
- Yes.

35:43.793 --> 35:45.894
But that's why
it would work so well.

35:45.928 --> 35:49.500
You could stay here,
do whatever you want.

35:49.534 --> 35:51.435
Kevin would have a father.

35:51.469 --> 35:53.203
Or you could come with me.

35:53.237 --> 35:54.906
You'd love Detroit.

35:54.940 --> 35:56.742
We could have a mansion.

35:56.776 --> 35:59.710
- When did all this happen?
- I just heard it.

35:59.745 --> 36:02.413
And you can't relay it,

36:02.448 --> 36:04.814
because they're moving
the XP to Campbell-Ewald.

36:05.815 --> 36:07.782
- We lost Chevy?
- Yes.

36:07.816 --> 36:10.350
But the audition was a success.

36:10.385 --> 36:13.685
There's something else
coming down the road.

36:13.720 --> 36:15.919
The times
like this, Joan--

36:15.954 --> 36:19.787
this is when you need someone.

36:19.821 --> 36:22.923
We could comfort each other
through an uncertain world.

36:24.658 --> 36:26.990
I can't think
about this right now.

36:28.561 --> 36:31.595
I'm thinking about you, Joan.

36:31.629 --> 36:33.697
Is this what you want?

36:33.732 --> 36:36.267
To be near 40 in a
two-bedroom apartment

36:36.301 --> 36:38.536
with a mother and a little boy?

36:39.537 --> 36:42.073
I know I am flawed,

36:42.108 --> 36:46.044
but I am offering you more
than anyone else ever will.

36:48.750 --> 36:51.454
No, you're not, Bob.

36:51.488 --> 36:53.792
Because I want love.

36:55.262 --> 36:59.331
And I'd rather die
hoping that happens

36:59.365 --> 37:01.736
than make some arrangement.

37:04.873 --> 37:07.142
And you should too.

37:09.746 --> 37:11.981
I'm just being realistic.

37:13.984 --> 37:16.385
Good night.

37:35.598 --> 37:37.733
<i>( "Forever and Ever"</i>
<i>plays in background )</i>

37:44.571 --> 37:46.971
Okay, so in this new version,
<i>Dad's</i> driving the car.

37:47.006 --> 37:51.143
Mom's next to him, admiring?

37:52.776 --> 37:54.741
How about a convertible?

37:54.775 --> 37:57.311
Little boy and little girl
in the back,

37:57.346 --> 38:00.712
Dad's got a pipe in his mouth.
( chuckles )

38:00.746 --> 38:03.816
Jesus, it's going to look
like 1955.

38:03.850 --> 38:06.051
1955 was a good year.

38:06.085 --> 38:08.249
I don't remember.

38:08.284 --> 38:10.419
1965 was a good year.

38:11.422 --> 38:13.258
I got married.

38:14.426 --> 38:15.759
Moms love Burger Chef

38:15.793 --> 38:18.732
because it's an answer
to a crisis.

38:20.003 --> 38:22.005
What if Mom's
coming home from work?

38:23.006 --> 38:24.472
What's her profession?

38:25.709 --> 38:27.278
You are surrounded

38:27.312 --> 38:29.582
by all kinds of mothers
who work, Don.

38:33.556 --> 38:35.359
It's too sad for an ad.

38:35.393 --> 38:36.961
( sighs )

38:36.995 --> 38:39.062
Fine.

38:39.096 --> 38:40.862
She burned the roast,

38:40.896 --> 38:43.534
she dented the fender...

38:45.204 --> 38:47.005
Keep going.

38:48.007 --> 38:50.508
She backed over the dog,

38:50.542 --> 38:53.244
little Katie's pregnant,
Jimmy got drafted,

38:53.278 --> 38:55.313
but there is still a burger
and fries on that table?

38:56.949 --> 38:59.918
Does this family exist anymore?

38:59.952 --> 39:02.685
Are there people who eat dinner

39:02.720 --> 39:05.991
and smile at each other
instead of watching TV?

39:09.428 --> 39:11.698
Did you ever do that
with your family?

39:13.867 --> 39:15.969
I don't remember.

39:18.809 --> 39:22.245
What the hell do I know
about being a mom?

39:22.279 --> 39:24.044
I just turned 30, Don.

39:25.447 --> 39:27.582
Shit. When?

39:28.652 --> 39:30.786
A couple of weeks ago.

39:30.820 --> 39:33.154
It doesn't matter.

39:33.189 --> 39:36.490
I kept it as secret as I could.

39:36.524 --> 39:39.728
Now I'm one of those women
lying about her age.

39:39.763 --> 39:41.565
I hate them.

39:44.302 --> 39:47.604
I worry about a lot of things,

39:47.638 --> 39:49.709
but I don't worry about you.

39:54.182 --> 39:56.185
What do you have
to worry about?

40:01.426 --> 40:04.362
That I never did anything,

40:04.397 --> 40:07.167
and that I don't have anyone.

40:13.606 --> 40:16.208
I was in Ohio,

40:16.242 --> 40:19.244
Michigan, Pennsylvania.

40:20.578 --> 40:24.312
I looked in the window
of so many station wagons.

40:28.016 --> 40:30.954
What did I do wrong?

40:41.328 --> 40:43.762
You're doing great.

40:53.246 --> 40:55.581
What if there was a place

40:55.616 --> 40:58.248
where you could go...

40:58.282 --> 41:00.318
where there was no TV...

41:01.488 --> 41:04.290
and you could break bread...

41:05.593 --> 41:07.595
and whoever you were
sitting with

41:07.629 --> 41:09.531
was family?

41:12.770 --> 41:16.069

41:20.042 --> 41:22.346

43:13.872 --> 43:17.039
It's official.
The XP is no longer ours.

43:17.073 --> 43:18.672
But they've thought of a name.

43:18.706 --> 43:21.812
They're going to call it
"Roger Sterling's failure."

43:21.846 --> 43:24.414
- I thought <i> you</i> signed them.
- Where did you hear this?

43:25.649 --> 43:28.050
You knew?

43:28.085 --> 43:29.752
Cutler: <i>I think we should
get ahead of this.</i>

43:29.786 --> 43:31.853
I am proposing a "New
York Times" article

43:31.887 --> 43:34.586
and the "Journal," too, announcing
that we're open for business

43:34.620 --> 43:37.424
with our IBM 360 and our
proprietary software.

43:37.458 --> 43:40.328
And there's a big
picture of Harry Crane,

43:40.362 --> 43:43.361
- our newest partner.
- What?

43:43.396 --> 43:45.930
The rest of it's fine,
but Harry Crane's a partner?

43:45.964 --> 43:47.863
If that's what it takes.

43:47.897 --> 43:49.831
I'm not going limping
into Burger Chef.

43:49.865 --> 43:51.600
Why does he
have to be a <i> partner?</i>

43:51.634 --> 43:53.968
Say what you will,
but he's very loyal.

43:55.502 --> 43:58.033
All in favor?

44:02.006 --> 44:04.240
Opposed?

44:06.776 --> 44:10.012
The motion carries.
With two abstentions.

44:10.047 --> 44:12.582
All right,
everybody back to work.

44:16.921 --> 44:19.721
I've got it.

44:19.756 --> 44:22.996
- What the hell do you want?
- Not Harry Crane as partner.

44:23.031 --> 44:24.866
Well, you knew about Chevy,
and you didn't tell me.

44:24.900 --> 44:27.201
- I could have done something.
- There was nothing to do.

44:27.235 --> 44:28.668
Spill the beans or get out.

44:30.270 --> 44:31.773
Bob Benson told me.

44:31.807 --> 44:34.879
- He's going to Buick.
- Bob Benson?

44:34.913 --> 44:38.583
- Please don't get him in trouble.
- You're kidding?

44:38.617 --> 44:41.618
- I knew McCann was up to something.
- What are you talking about?

44:41.653 --> 44:43.319
They're afraid we're
going to steal Buick.

44:43.353 --> 44:44.619
What?

44:44.653 --> 44:48.159
Just forget it.
Thank you.

44:56.098 --> 44:58.537
Now we have nothing.
We're only weeks away.

44:58.571 --> 45:00.539
Just hear her out.

45:00.574 --> 45:02.740
She'll have you done
in time for dinner.

45:04.377 --> 45:06.913
My plans got cancelled.

45:13.955 --> 45:16.057
Look around.

45:17.060 --> 45:20.626
I want to shoot the ad in here.

45:20.661 --> 45:23.398
- It's not a home.
- It's better.

45:23.433 --> 45:25.702
It's a clean,
well-lighted place.

45:26.837 --> 45:28.237
Okay, Hemingway.

45:28.271 --> 45:30.203
As long as it's
still about moms.

45:30.238 --> 45:32.641
It's about family.

45:32.676 --> 45:35.113
Every table here
is the family table.

45:35.147 --> 45:37.215
I hate
even the word "family."

45:37.250 --> 45:39.115
It's vague.

45:39.149 --> 45:41.518
"Mom" is more specific.
Tell her, Don.

45:41.552 --> 45:44.591
She's doing it the way
she wants to do it.

45:44.626 --> 45:47.393
You want it right or not?
