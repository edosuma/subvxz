00:02.169 --> 00:04.263
Previously on
Arrow and The Flash...

00:05.547 --> 00:07.299
Guys, this isn't a meteor.

00:09.801 --> 00:11.474
<i>We've been calling them
the Dominators.</i>

00:11.762 --> 00:14.686
We learned they were abducting humans
to gather intel about us.

00:14.848 --> 00:17.021
If they decide to attack,
no military can stop them.

00:17.184 --> 00:18.936
- You can't do this alone.
- I don't plan to.

00:19.102 --> 00:20.649
<i>Guys! Thanks for coming.</i>

00:20.812 --> 00:22.189
Barry, I thought
you were bringing an alien?

00:22.356 --> 00:25.701
This is my friend,
Kara Danvers. Supergirl.

00:25.901 --> 00:28.700
Call Lyla, tell her these Dominators
aren't here peacefully.

00:53.637 --> 00:55.184
<i>So, how was your run?</i>

00:55.889 --> 00:58.563
You know how it was,
I told you about it in the shower.

01:00.727 --> 01:02.070
Here you go.

01:05.190 --> 01:07.363
- How could I forget?
- Hmm.

01:08.402 --> 01:10.621
Dinah Laurel Lance,

01:13.907 --> 01:15.329
will you marry me?

01:16.743 --> 01:18.461
I think I already answered that question.

01:19.162 --> 01:20.163
Right.

01:26.211 --> 01:30.136
Okay, time to get ready,
my sister will be here soon.

01:50.652 --> 01:52.404
Any word from Felicity?

01:52.654 --> 01:55.328
Only that Oliver, John, and Thea
have been abducted by aliens.

01:55.657 --> 01:57.455
She actually made that sound normal.

01:57.618 --> 02:00.792
I got every traffic cam from here
to Central City looking for them.

02:00.954 --> 02:03.332
Yeah, like traffic cams are gonna
help against alien invaders.

02:03.498 --> 02:05.250
You know what, it'll probably help more

02:05.417 --> 02:07.169
than you trying to pretend
to be Oliver Queen.

02:07.336 --> 02:09.383
Nothing to pretend about.
Gotta keep in shape,

02:09.545 --> 02:11.844
so when these ETs show up,
I can kick their collective asses.

02:12.007 --> 02:14.226
Yeah, you'll have better luck
on the salmon ladder.

02:14.384 --> 02:18.264
My whole life, I've waited to see
a sign of intelligent life.

02:18.764 --> 02:19.811
Now that I'm seeing it,

02:19.973 --> 02:21.896
they're not intelligent at all,
they're just mean.

02:22.100 --> 02:23.226
I can't believe it.

02:23.560 --> 02:24.777
Try to start.

02:25.187 --> 02:27.986
Guys, this is Cisco Ramon,
of S.T.A.R. Labs.

02:28.440 --> 02:29.612
Curtis. Big fan.

02:30.067 --> 02:31.660
- Rene Ramirez.
- Rory Regan.

02:32.778 --> 02:35.031
Okay. Curtis, you're tall.

02:35.697 --> 02:37.916
Rene, and Rory.

02:38.241 --> 02:41.245
That's two Rorys I know now.
The other one, he's a douche though.

02:41.787 --> 02:43.130
- You're not a douche, are you?
- No.

02:43.372 --> 02:46.216
Okay. Good,
I just had to make sure, right?

02:46.375 --> 02:48.719
Guys, we have to find Oliver and company,

02:48.877 --> 02:51.801
and I'm not talking about the cherished
Disney animated film

02:51.963 --> 02:54.967
starring Billy Joel, okay?
I'm talking, I gotta vibe, all right?

02:55.258 --> 02:56.976
I need something to vibe off of,
something personal?

02:57.135 --> 02:58.978
I got one of his old bows here somewhere.

02:59.429 --> 03:00.521
<i>That'll do.</i>

03:00.722 --> 03:02.599
Um, for those of us
who don't know you as well,

03:02.766 --> 03:03.938
not me, 'cause I feel like
we're best friends,

03:04.101 --> 03:05.148
and we've known each other
for a long time.

03:05.310 --> 03:07.358
Uh, what are you going to do exactly?

03:07.521 --> 03:09.865
Oh, right. Uh, I'm about to vibe.

03:10.107 --> 03:12.826
It's this thing I do
where I touch something,

03:12.984 --> 03:14.486
I can not only see the past,

03:14.653 --> 03:17.281
I can see the future,
but most importantly,

03:17.531 --> 03:20.000
I can see where people are.

03:20.951 --> 03:23.955
So you're one of them, a meta-human.

03:24.788 --> 03:25.960
Yeah.

03:26.123 --> 03:27.966
Don't sound too excited about it.

03:28.542 --> 03:31.887
Okay, so this is it.
Just, please don't break it.

03:32.462 --> 03:34.715
Any more than it already is broken.
Okay, go.

03:55.652 --> 03:56.995
I saw them.

03:57.154 --> 03:59.577
They were in some kind
of stasis, like a ship.

04:00.407 --> 04:02.125
It's a little <i>Alien,</i>

04:02.284 --> 04:05.083
a little Star Trek, J.J. Abrams style,
and a whole lot of tech.

04:05.245 --> 04:06.872
- You said tech!
- Yes, I said tech.

04:07.038 --> 04:09.837
It's an alien spaceship, Felicity,
these guys aren't amateurs.

04:10.584 --> 04:13.133
I think where she's going is,
if we had some,

04:13.336 --> 04:15.759
we might be able download
some intel off it, like,

04:15.922 --> 04:17.173
including everyone's location.

04:17.339 --> 04:18.762
- Yes!
- Hold, please.

04:20.343 --> 04:21.515
- Yes.
- Yes.

04:21.678 --> 04:22.725
- That's what I meant.
- In fact.

04:22.888 --> 04:25.437
- Thank you. Always got my back.
- Of course, yeah. Of course, I do.

04:25.849 --> 04:27.021
What about this?

04:27.309 --> 04:29.812
I took it off the Dominator ship
that crashed in Central City.

04:29.978 --> 04:32.072
- What?
- We're gonna hack alien tech.

04:32.230 --> 04:34.483
This is seriously the best day
of my entire life!

04:36.526 --> 04:38.119
You didn't have to get me a gift, Speedy.

04:38.361 --> 04:40.580
It's just a little
pre-rehearsal dinner gesture.

04:43.241 --> 04:45.960
- Well, "little" is right.
- It's called a "Hozen."

04:46.369 --> 04:49.543
It symbolizes reconnecting,
like you did with Laurel.

04:49.915 --> 04:51.007
Thea, it's a rock.

04:51.166 --> 04:54.966
It's a very thoughtful gesture
from your amazingly loving sister.

04:55.587 --> 04:57.385
- Thank you.
- Yeah, that's better.

04:58.381 --> 04:59.553
Wow. What's going on here?

05:00.550 --> 05:01.802
Thea gave me a rock.

05:03.345 --> 05:04.392
Let's go, champ,

05:04.554 --> 05:07.398
we got a 6:00 appointment
at the tailors, gotta fight traffic.

05:07.557 --> 05:09.480
Oh, Dad, you know
I'm not much of a fighter.

05:09.643 --> 05:12.362
Tell that to the paparazzo you punched.

05:12.896 --> 05:14.318
- Ten years ago!
- Still.

05:14.481 --> 05:16.154
Might as well be a lifetime.

05:17.359 --> 05:19.782
You're practically
a completely different person.

05:20.445 --> 05:21.492
You both are.

05:21.655 --> 05:23.407
Don't start crying again, Momma,

05:23.573 --> 05:25.541
just save all the tears
for the actual wedding.

05:25.700 --> 05:28.749
I think what your mother's trying to say,
is that both of us feel blessed

05:28.912 --> 05:31.381
to have watched the two of you grow up.

05:36.253 --> 05:38.881
Whoa! Sweet reflexes.

05:40.006 --> 05:41.007
God.

05:41.299 --> 05:44.678
How much luggage did you bring?

05:46.012 --> 05:47.059
Thank you.

05:47.222 --> 05:49.145
What do you think, you're moving in?

05:50.851 --> 05:52.478
I wish.

05:54.688 --> 05:57.487
- I miss you.
- I miss you, too.

05:58.275 --> 05:59.697
This is beautiful.

05:59.860 --> 06:00.952
Thanks.

06:01.194 --> 06:02.241
Ollie got it for me.

06:02.445 --> 06:04.368
- Is it a bird?
- It's a canary.

06:07.450 --> 06:08.747
Sara?

06:12.706 --> 06:14.253
I just really missed you.

06:17.544 --> 06:19.217
A tux is a good look on you.

06:19.379 --> 06:21.177
Never really felt like my thing.

06:22.007 --> 06:24.351
Maybe you'd be more comfortable
in a suit and tie.

06:24.634 --> 06:25.726
Dad, come on.

06:25.886 --> 06:28.264
I get sworn in as Mayor
in less than two months.

06:28.513 --> 06:32.063
I don't have time to find a
replacement CEO for Queen Consolidated.

06:32.225 --> 06:33.351
What about, um...

06:33.977 --> 06:35.274
Walter Steele?

06:36.062 --> 06:40.363
The Board won't back him.
Besides, QC is a family company.

06:40.650 --> 06:41.867
It should stay in the family.

06:42.068 --> 06:44.821
Dad, I wanna make my own name.

06:45.155 --> 06:46.828
I don't just wanna rely on yours.

06:46.990 --> 06:48.492
Oliver, if you don't do it,
the Board's gonna push

06:48.658 --> 06:50.877
to accept Ray Palmer's buyout offer.

06:51.369 --> 06:53.121
- I...
- What?

06:53.997 --> 06:55.123
I don't know.

06:59.628 --> 07:01.346
- Excuse me.
- Excuse yourself.

07:02.088 --> 07:04.216
Watches, wallets, phones.

07:04.758 --> 07:06.510
What're you, deaf?
Trying to catch a bullet?

07:06.760 --> 07:08.353
- Take it easy.
- I'll shoot your ass right here.

07:08.553 --> 07:09.645
Hey!

07:10.555 --> 07:12.557
- Get away from him.
- You want a piece of this?

07:26.571 --> 07:28.198
Are you all right?

07:29.407 --> 07:30.533
Yeah.

07:30.700 --> 07:32.247
You could've been killed.

07:33.328 --> 07:34.875
Why would you do a thing like that?

07:43.546 --> 07:46.049
Wow. Mom is totally gonna freak out.

07:46.549 --> 07:48.267
That's probably why
she doesn't need to know.

07:48.426 --> 07:50.394
Yeah, she probably
wouldn't believe the part

07:50.595 --> 07:52.268
about the guy in a hood, anyway, so.

07:52.472 --> 07:55.567
Actually, your brother was the one
who came to my rescue first.

07:56.309 --> 07:57.561
You're quite the hero, son.

08:01.731 --> 08:03.028
on, my God.

08:03.274 --> 08:04.400
I heard what happened.

08:04.651 --> 08:05.823
Are you okay?

08:05.986 --> 08:07.704
Yeah. Hey, hey.

08:07.904 --> 08:09.247
I'm fine, I'm fine.

08:13.868 --> 08:16.121
Oliver. Oliver, are you okay?

08:18.707 --> 08:20.380
No, I'm fine, I'm...

08:20.917 --> 08:23.090
Probably just need some air, I'm gonna...

08:23.670 --> 08:25.092
I'll see you at the restaurant.

08:30.552 --> 08:32.600
I'm so conflicted.

08:32.761 --> 08:34.105
You know, on the one hand,

08:34.264 --> 08:37.313
I get to hack
actual extraterrestrial technology.

08:37.475 --> 08:39.602
But, on the other hand, ETs are real,

08:39.769 --> 08:42.693
but unfortunately they're dickwads
who are gonna kill us.

08:43.273 --> 08:45.196
Don't worry, it's gonna work out.

08:45.734 --> 08:48.237
You're not gonna tell me
God has a plan, are you?

08:48.528 --> 08:49.620
- Well...
- Look,

08:49.779 --> 08:52.749
I respect your religion and all,
I just find it a little hard to believe

08:52.907 --> 08:55.126
that there's some divine plan
to the universe

08:55.285 --> 08:57.253
which also includes space monsters.

08:57.412 --> 08:58.459
What's that?

08:58.621 --> 09:00.999
I like call it my 3PO processor.

09:01.166 --> 09:03.168
"I am fluent in over six million
forms of communication."

09:03.334 --> 09:05.007
And it speaks Dominator?

09:05.170 --> 09:07.172
I didn't specifically program it for that,

09:07.338 --> 09:10.808
but in my defense, I didn't know
the Dominators even existed.

09:11.092 --> 09:12.469
Let's see if it works.

09:18.058 --> 09:20.732
I feel like Elliot in E.T.
"It's working! It's working!"

09:21.144 --> 09:23.146
- Your tech guy quotes movies?
- Yeah.

09:23.313 --> 09:24.656
Real original.

09:26.733 --> 09:28.531
- No, no, no.
- No, no.

09:32.447 --> 09:33.619
What happened?

09:34.491 --> 09:37.370
We made an idiot move,
that's what happened. Ow!

09:37.660 --> 09:40.004
We tried to plug human tech
into a Dominator power source,

09:40.288 --> 09:41.460
of course it overloaded.

09:41.623 --> 09:43.091
We need a regulator, okay?

09:43.249 --> 09:45.297
Something that can handle
the Dominator juice.

09:45.460 --> 09:48.088
Van Horn Industries was working on
a prototype for NASA over a year ago.

09:48.254 --> 09:49.506
Maybe they perfected it by now.

09:49.672 --> 09:52.391
Yeah, they perfected it, all right.
So much so, somebody's already stolen it.

09:52.550 --> 09:55.394
According to SCPD reports, it was
a doctor named Laura Washington?

09:55.553 --> 09:57.351
A doctor? That doesn't make any sense.

09:57.514 --> 10:00.438
It does if she's been artificially
augmenting herself with stolen technology,

10:00.600 --> 10:02.602
because why would the universe
make anything easy?

10:02.811 --> 10:05.690
It says here, implants give her
enhanced strength, stamina,

10:05.855 --> 10:07.528
and electricity-based powers.

10:07.982 --> 10:09.859
Well, it's nothing we can't handle.

10:10.026 --> 10:11.949
That's everything we can't handle.

10:12.112 --> 10:13.705
Come on, Felicity, I mean,
this might be our only chance

10:13.863 --> 10:15.706
to find Oliver and everyone else.

10:16.366 --> 10:17.868
That's why I'm calling in reinforcements.

10:21.412 --> 10:24.211
- Oh, hey, Captain Lance.
- Hey. I was just on my way out.

10:24.415 --> 10:25.541
Do you have a minute for me?

10:25.708 --> 10:27.255
Yeah. Actually,
I should've called you earlier.

10:27.418 --> 10:29.796
Detective Hilton told me
about what happened tonight. You okay?

10:29.963 --> 10:31.636
Oh, yeah, my dad and I are fine.

10:31.798 --> 10:34.142
Good, good.
Well, we got the guy in custody.

10:34.300 --> 10:36.052
Because of the guy with the bow and arrow.

10:36.219 --> 10:40.065
Yeah, yeah, we've been calling him
The Hood. Some kinda vigilante.

10:41.850 --> 10:44.820
If I've got the time right,
your rehearsal dinner is practically now.

10:49.107 --> 10:50.108
Freeze!

10:54.112 --> 10:55.204
Oliver?

10:55.363 --> 10:59.413
Do you have any leads
on who The Hood might be or...

10:59.576 --> 11:00.953
This is the last thing
you should be thinking about

11:01.119 --> 11:02.336
the night before your wedding.

11:03.580 --> 11:05.207
Or is that what's going on here?

11:05.999 --> 11:07.751
- What do you mean?
- You getting cold feet?

11:08.001 --> 11:09.469
No, not at all, I promise.

11:09.627 --> 11:11.721
Good, 'cause I would hate
to have to shoot you

11:11.880 --> 11:13.427
for breaking my girl's heart, okay?

11:13.590 --> 11:15.092
Paperwork would be hell.

11:15.425 --> 11:18.144
In truth, I'm probably
a little bit more shaken up

11:18.344 --> 11:19.937
by the whole mugging than maybe I thought.

11:20.096 --> 11:21.393
Well, you know,
I got just the thing to fix that.

11:21.556 --> 11:23.433
A few drinks at your rehearsal dinner.
I'm buyin', come on.

11:23.641 --> 11:26.269
Yeah, actually, Captain Lance,
I'll meet you there.

11:26.603 --> 11:28.446
- You sure?
- Yeah, I'll see you there.

11:30.732 --> 11:33.281
Actually, uh, Oliver,
something I wanna say.

11:33.443 --> 11:34.615
You know, um,

11:34.819 --> 11:37.743
when you and Laurel were kids,
you know, teenagers,

11:37.947 --> 11:40.450
I... Well, let's face it,
I didn't like you much.

11:40.700 --> 11:41.747
Well.

11:41.910 --> 11:43.332
Yeah, I thought you were a rich,
entitled punk.

11:43.494 --> 11:44.495
I was.

11:44.829 --> 11:48.800
But since then, Oliver,
you have grown into a hell of a man.

11:49.792 --> 11:52.420
The kinda guy I'm proud
to have as my son-in-law.

11:53.588 --> 11:54.840
Thank you, Captain Lance.

11:55.381 --> 11:57.133
- See you at that dinner.
- I'll see you there.

11:57.300 --> 11:58.517
All right.

12:12.148 --> 12:13.274
<i>LAUREL". He's not coming.</i>

12:13.441 --> 12:14.988
Don't worry, he'll be here.

12:15.151 --> 12:17.995
You know Ollie's never been on time
for anything in his entire life.

12:18.154 --> 12:20.953
You didn't see him earlier,
he had this look on his face,

12:21.115 --> 12:22.583
like he was backing out.

12:22.951 --> 12:24.453
No way. He loves you.

12:25.453 --> 12:28.172
He looked like everything
that he knew was wrong.

12:28.414 --> 12:32.464
I'm pretty sure that every guy has
that look the night before their wedding.

12:34.337 --> 12:37.181
You know, there was a time
when I thought the two of you

12:37.382 --> 12:38.634
would actually hook up.

12:39.550 --> 12:41.052
You know I prefer girls.

12:42.553 --> 12:44.021
Oh, hey.

12:44.264 --> 12:47.859
Ah. Miss Lance. Hi, I'm Ray Palmer,
a business associate of Oliver's father.

12:48.017 --> 12:49.769
I just wanted to say congratulations.

12:49.936 --> 12:51.779
Thank you, it's really nice to meet you.

12:52.188 --> 12:54.407
Uh, this is my sister, Sara.

12:56.359 --> 12:57.656
Have we met before?

12:58.528 --> 12:59.654
<i>Ray!</i>

13:01.406 --> 13:02.999
No, I think I'd remember.

13:03.908 --> 13:06.036
You just seem very familiar.

13:07.620 --> 13:08.963
- Excuse us.
- Yeah.

13:10.540 --> 13:13.384
Are you sure you prefer girls? He's hot.

13:38.234 --> 13:39.827
Oh, wow.

13:43.031 --> 13:44.248
What the hell?

13:46.200 --> 13:48.453
Hi. We have an unauthorized entry!

14:09.098 --> 14:10.645
What are you doing here?

14:12.352 --> 14:13.774
How did you find this place?

14:16.773 --> 14:18.741
- My name is Oliver Queen...
- I know who you are.

14:18.900 --> 14:20.402
Everybody knows who you are.

14:20.568 --> 14:23.697
- How did you find this place?
- Better question is why?

14:23.946 --> 14:25.539
He's getting married tomorrow.

14:25.782 --> 14:26.999
- Get out.
- Wait...

14:27.158 --> 14:28.284
Get out!

14:28.451 --> 14:29.623
Wait, wait!

14:29.786 --> 14:32.130
No one can know my secret.

14:35.208 --> 14:36.551
Your name is John.

14:36.709 --> 14:39.462
- What did you say?
- Your name...

14:39.921 --> 14:41.639
...is John Diggle.

14:43.800 --> 14:45.222
<i>My brother needed me.</i>

14:51.933 --> 14:53.480
NO. NO.

14:54.977 --> 14:57.105
No! No, no, no.

14:58.564 --> 14:59.611
Bad idea.

14:59.816 --> 15:00.988
How do you know all this?

15:02.819 --> 15:04.742
I think we've met before

15:05.655 --> 15:07.202
and you were my bodyguard.

15:07.573 --> 15:08.620
And you think I'm funny.

15:08.783 --> 15:11.332
You're thinking of my brother, Andy.
He's in personal security.

15:12.120 --> 15:13.622
You were in the military.

15:16.207 --> 15:18.050
105th Airborne out of Kandahar.

15:18.751 --> 15:21.129
Did a lot of things back then
I'm not proud of.

15:21.337 --> 15:23.055
I came back here to...

15:24.841 --> 15:26.058
...atone, I guess.

15:26.551 --> 15:30.772
Uh, John, stranger danger?
Might wanna ease up on the info dump.

15:31.305 --> 15:32.932
<i>Felicity Smoak?</i>

15:38.187 --> 15:39.404
Felicity...

15:41.315 --> 15:42.612
This isn't right.

15:43.317 --> 15:44.864
I don't think that any of...

15:45.653 --> 15:48.827
...of this is right.
I don't think that you're the Green Arrow.

15:50.533 --> 15:52.456
And I don't think Andy's alive.

15:54.996 --> 15:56.543
John, I think you killed him.

15:59.584 --> 16:01.302
I hate being right all the time.

16:02.712 --> 16:05.386
Listen to me. You're having
some kind of psychotic break.

16:05.631 --> 16:08.931
Go back to your family, your fiancée,
and your fancy house,

16:09.093 --> 16:11.266
and you're gonna forget about all of this!

16:13.055 --> 16:15.399
Felicity is right,
you've got everything.

16:15.933 --> 16:17.355
Everything, man.

16:18.728 --> 16:20.446
Stop trying to throw it all away.

16:31.365 --> 16:33.367
You should've taken him up on
his offer to carry you.

16:33.534 --> 16:36.458
- It was awesome.
- Nobody's carrying me anywhere.

16:37.580 --> 16:40.709
It's so cool Felicity reached out,
it's awesome to meet you.

16:41.042 --> 16:43.340
Yeah, well, wait till you meet her.

16:46.797 --> 16:48.299
', everyone!

16:50.259 --> 16:51.977
Oh, I've had enough of this.

17:00.728 --> 17:02.776
Yo, you want some company?

17:03.105 --> 17:04.402
Not really.

17:05.107 --> 17:09.282
Right. Um, so, what exactly is it
you've "had enough of"?

17:10.029 --> 17:13.032
Nothing. I just didn't know
there were flying meta-humans now.

17:13.199 --> 17:14.541
No sign of Washington.

17:14.700 --> 17:16.953
Yeah, Supergirl's not a meta,
she's an alien.

17:17.161 --> 17:20.131
- Oh, well, I'm one of the good ones.
- There are no good ones.

17:20.330 --> 17:21.958
Hey, what's your damage, man?

17:27.964 --> 17:31.138
My "damage" is that people like you two
have the power of gods,

17:31.300 --> 17:33.052
yet you think you can make
the world a better place

17:33.219 --> 17:34.892
just by putting on a fancy costume.

17:35.137 --> 17:38.016
No, we think we make the world
a better place because...

17:39.100 --> 17:40.352
- Well, we do.
- Yeah.

17:40.518 --> 17:41.565
Look around.

17:41.727 --> 17:44.071
Moment he showed up,
metas start appearing everywhere.

17:44.230 --> 17:46.153
Now you show up, and we get aliens.

17:46.482 --> 17:48.325
Superpowers are evil, man,

17:48.651 --> 17:51.575
and I don't want anything to do with them

17:51.862 --> 17:53.330
or with either of you.

18:15.511 --> 18:19.687
Thea, you have grown into
the most beautiful young woman.

18:21.350 --> 18:23.944
It's just a bridesmaid's dress, Mom.
No one actually looks good in one.

18:24.103 --> 18:25.480
Well, you do.

18:26.272 --> 18:27.489
You look fulfilled.

18:27.648 --> 18:29.992
Yeah, I don't know about that one, Mom,

18:30.943 --> 18:34.163
but I do know I have never been happier.

18:34.697 --> 18:35.789
Good.

18:35.948 --> 18:37.541
- And I love you, Mom.
- Oh.

18:38.200 --> 18:40.123
My baby girl.

18:40.369 --> 18:41.370
Mmm!

18:41.954 --> 18:43.547
Okay, we're gonna wrinkle the dress.

18:43.706 --> 18:45.128
No, I really don't care.

18:45.291 --> 18:46.463
Okay.

18:48.169 --> 18:49.546
<i>No! Mom!</i>

18:51.547 --> 18:52.890
Thea?

18:53.633 --> 18:54.885
Are you okay?

18:55.593 --> 18:56.890
Yeah.

19:00.890 --> 19:02.233
Laurel, I...

19:02.475 --> 19:05.399
Don't you know it's bad luck
to see the bride before the wedding?

19:05.561 --> 19:07.154
Or skip out on the rehearsal dinner?

19:07.313 --> 19:08.860
I know, I said I was sorry.

19:09.023 --> 19:10.366
In a text.

19:11.567 --> 19:13.786
Sara, can you give us
a few minutes, please?

19:18.532 --> 19:21.126
You're lucky
I'm not a trained assassin or anything.

19:30.753 --> 19:31.754
Oh, wow.

19:33.464 --> 19:36.058
You, um, you look beautiful.

19:36.217 --> 19:38.265
I called you over 20 times last night.

19:38.427 --> 19:41.055
I can't explain last night, I just...

19:43.140 --> 19:44.517
Today,

19:45.434 --> 19:47.027
today I wanna marry you.

19:48.229 --> 19:50.072
Well, that's good
because there are guests here...

19:50.231 --> 19:52.108
No, not with guests,
not in a few hours, now!

19:52.692 --> 19:54.786
Laurel, I need to get out of here.

19:55.236 --> 19:56.453
- We can elope.
- Oliver...

19:56.612 --> 19:59.081
I'm being serious, I don't know
what's going on with me right now,

19:59.240 --> 20:02.619
I just know that I want to be with
you as quickly as humanly possible.

20:03.619 --> 20:05.041
What is going on with you?

20:07.456 --> 20:09.458
Last night, somebody reminded me

20:10.876 --> 20:12.298
that I have everything,

20:15.256 --> 20:16.849
and I don't wanna give it up.

20:17.717 --> 20:19.685
I'm afraid that I'm gonna give it up.

20:21.095 --> 20:22.847
Well, that's very sweet of you,

20:23.472 --> 20:26.021
but we have over 200 guests coming
and your parents,

20:26.183 --> 20:27.605
they've have spent a fortune
on this wedding.

20:27.768 --> 20:29.361
I know, I'm just...

20:29.520 --> 20:31.648
I'm sorry if this is confusing,
or if I'm scaring you,

20:31.814 --> 20:34.693
but the only thing in the world

20:35.151 --> 20:36.949
that makes sense to me right now

20:38.404 --> 20:39.826
is that I love you.

20:40.573 --> 20:43.167
And I'm gonna take that job
at Queen Consolidated,

20:44.034 --> 20:46.628
and I swear to God,
I'm gonna work every single day

20:47.121 --> 20:48.998
to be the man you fell in love with.

20:53.335 --> 20:55.008
Sorry about the interruption,

20:55.171 --> 20:57.173
the Russian lady downstairs told me
to come right up.

20:58.174 --> 20:59.596
You got a minute to talk?

21:00.843 --> 21:02.186
I'll be right back.

21:04.054 --> 21:06.603
Now, what happened to,
"I should just go back to my life"?

21:06.766 --> 21:09.690
Well, look, have you been getting
out into the city lately?

21:09.852 --> 21:12.776
Seeing maybe a particular building
that shouldn't be there?

21:13.022 --> 21:14.569
- Smoak Technologies.
- Yeah.

21:14.815 --> 21:17.409
Yeah, well, when I was with my dad,
I saw it, and it, felt...

21:17.693 --> 21:19.320
- It felt wrong.
- Right.

21:19.945 --> 21:24.371
Felicity Smoak says she never owned
a building or a company.

21:25.826 --> 21:27.703
I don't know what's going on here.

21:28.788 --> 21:30.165
But when you left,
I started having these...

21:30.331 --> 21:32.800
Visions, right? Like, uh,

21:33.751 --> 21:35.845
memory flashes, I'm getting them, too.

21:36.420 --> 21:37.797
John, what is happening to us?

21:37.963 --> 21:40.307
I have no idea. I've seen some weird
things in the 'Stan,

21:40.466 --> 21:42.764
even stranger things as The Hood,
but this...

21:44.178 --> 21:46.397
Look, when you left, I tried

21:46.597 --> 21:50.022
to draw one of these
"memory flashes" as you call 'em.

21:50.309 --> 21:52.107
I've never been much of an artist.

21:53.896 --> 21:55.443
This is what I came up with.

21:58.567 --> 22:00.160
- What the hell?
- I don't know.

22:00.569 --> 22:03.322
I've been remembering things.
It's like they're dreams, but they're not.

22:03.572 --> 22:06.621
John, I don't think
that any of this is real.

22:06.784 --> 22:09.879
No, we're real. But whatever's playing
these head games with us,

22:10.329 --> 22:12.627
- I don't think it's fully working.
- Are you sure?

22:12.915 --> 22:14.713
<i>'Cause the Queen's Gambit...</i>

22:15.918 --> 22:18.296
They've put me into a world where
I never got on my father's boat.

22:18.462 --> 22:21.306
Oliver, I don't know if these
are memories, or feelings,

22:21.590 --> 22:24.764
but I think you're a hero, and I don't
think it's because of any boat.

22:24.927 --> 22:26.554
These head games aren't over.

22:26.846 --> 22:29.895
They are gonna push back
against whatever we do.

22:30.391 --> 22:31.517
Push back?

22:32.601 --> 22:33.944
Like how?

22:39.400 --> 22:40.447
Like that.

23:15.144 --> 23:16.316
How did I do that?

23:18.606 --> 23:20.734
All right, this is hard to explain.

23:21.025 --> 23:22.368
Well, start trying.

23:22.651 --> 23:23.823
We think...

23:24.278 --> 23:27.077
We think we're in some sort
of shared hallucination.

23:28.449 --> 23:29.541
That's crazy.

23:29.825 --> 23:32.999
I mean, not as crazy as me knowing
kung fu, but it is definitely up there.

23:33.162 --> 23:35.711
That wasn't kung fu, that was jeet kune do

23:35.873 --> 23:38.171
and I think that you learned it
in a spot called Nanda Parbat.

23:38.334 --> 23:41.508
Nothing you are saying is making sense,
none of this makes sense!

23:41.670 --> 23:43.718
Okay, look. All right.
Sara, what is the last thing you remember?

23:43.964 --> 23:46.467
- I don't know!
- I mean, before you came here, yesterday.

23:47.718 --> 23:50.141
What is the last thing that you remember?

23:56.018 --> 23:57.486
You remembered something. Come on.

23:57.686 --> 23:59.188
Sara, come on, concentrate!

24:06.070 --> 24:07.287
There was a fight.

24:07.446 --> 24:08.993
There was five of us, and then...

24:09.365 --> 24:11.367
- And then we were taken.
- Taken where?

24:12.493 --> 24:13.619
I don't know.

24:14.036 --> 24:16.710
All right, there were five of us.
Who were the other two?

24:16.997 --> 24:18.544
Ray Palmer, and...

24:18.874 --> 24:20.046
.“and, Thea.

24:20.584 --> 24:23.713
I mean, if this some kind of dream,
or "shared hallucination,"

24:23.879 --> 24:26.302
- then how do we wake up?
- By getting out of here.

24:27.299 --> 24:28.926
The Smoak Technologies building,

24:29.093 --> 24:31.471
maybe the reason why that place
seems so strange is because

24:31.637 --> 24:33.435
that's the way we get out of here.

24:34.723 --> 24:35.895
Wherever here is.

24:40.813 --> 24:42.110
What do you want?

24:42.773 --> 24:45.026
You stole something
from Van Horn Industries.

24:45.401 --> 24:46.573
You mean this?

24:46.860 --> 24:48.737
Yeah, hand it over.

24:49.071 --> 24:50.197
Or what?

24:50.906 --> 24:52.374
I'll take it from you.

24:52.908 --> 24:53.955
I doubt that.

24:58.622 --> 24:59.999
Do you wanna give up?

25:01.500 --> 25:03.002
I'm just getting started.

25:03.210 --> 25:04.257
So am l.

25:34.950 --> 25:36.827
That was awesome.

25:37.161 --> 25:41.007
There's the regulator. She seems pretty
attached to it.

25:41.290 --> 25:42.633
Maybe just remove it?

25:42.833 --> 25:43.925
Okay, yeah.

25:44.460 --> 25:45.632
Thanks for the save.

25:45.794 --> 25:49.014
- Is that all you have to say?
- I don't do apologies, sweetheart.

25:51.967 --> 25:53.890
But if super-powers are a thing,

25:54.636 --> 25:57.230
it's good there are guys like you
to help the world.

25:57.639 --> 26:00.563
You know, the green guy would've kicked
my ass if I talked to him like that.

26:00.726 --> 26:02.478
- Oh, yeah. Yeah, we know.
- That he would.

26:02.644 --> 26:03.645
Yep.

26:06.065 --> 26:07.988
It's too bad Tommy couldn't
make it, though.

26:08.150 --> 26:11.324
Well, they've got him working triple
shifts at the hospital these days.

26:11.487 --> 26:13.660
Besides, Chicago isn't exactly next door.

26:13.822 --> 26:15.165
Can't believe he's a doctor now.

26:15.324 --> 26:17.998
Well, he says the same thing about you,
Ms. "Entrepreneur."

26:18.160 --> 26:21.164
Yeah, I don't think running Verdant
makes me an entrepreneur.

26:21.371 --> 26:22.998
No, but it makes you successful.

26:23.165 --> 26:25.964
Your father should be very proud
of the woman you've grown into.

26:26.627 --> 26:28.721
Ray, I need to talk to you.

26:29.588 --> 26:31.010
Sara, right?

26:31.173 --> 26:32.720
- Yeah.
- Hi. Um...

26:33.008 --> 26:35.056
This is my fiancée, Felicity Smoak.

26:35.302 --> 26:37.475
Hi, nice to meet you.
Oh, you're Laurel's sister, right?

26:37.638 --> 26:39.640
Yeah. Can I steal him for a second?

26:39.807 --> 26:42.026
Yeah, yeah. Yeah, okay.

26:43.143 --> 26:44.360
Ray,

26:44.853 --> 26:46.696
doesn't this all feel weird to you?

26:47.648 --> 26:48.695
A little.

26:49.650 --> 26:51.027
I need you to think.

26:52.277 --> 26:53.654
She's not my fiancée.

26:54.530 --> 26:56.157
My fiancée's name is Anna.

26:56.907 --> 26:58.250
Or it was.

26:58.992 --> 27:00.209
What's happening?

27:00.494 --> 27:01.837
You're remembering.

27:06.542 --> 27:09.421
Son, don't you think
you should be getting your tuxedo on?

27:09.586 --> 27:11.384
- Um...
- Are you all right, Oliver?

27:11.547 --> 27:13.015
I just need to speak with Thea.

27:13.173 --> 27:15.926
I think I saw her talking to Malcolm
over by the ice sculpture.

27:16.093 --> 27:17.720
- Yeah, okay.
- Son.

27:19.388 --> 27:20.640
Think you need to calm down.

27:20.806 --> 27:23.480
We both do.
You're acting terribly strange.

27:23.892 --> 27:25.565
Your mother and I are concerned

27:25.769 --> 27:30.240
if you keep up this unstable behavior,
that is not going to finish well.

27:30.566 --> 27:32.489
That is not going to finish well.

27:34.236 --> 27:35.704
I'm just saying.

27:35.946 --> 27:38.199
Laurel, the company...

27:38.740 --> 27:40.287
This is your life now.

27:45.789 --> 27:46.961
No, it isn't.

27:48.834 --> 27:50.086
Oliver.

27:58.468 --> 27:59.765
I'm sorry.

28:06.935 --> 28:08.107
Speedy.

28:08.270 --> 28:09.487
She knows, Ollie.

28:09.730 --> 28:11.653
She knows, and she doesn't wanna go.

28:11.940 --> 28:14.193
Better question is, why would you want to?

28:15.110 --> 28:16.828
Because none of this is real.

28:16.987 --> 28:18.785
It's real enough, okay?

28:19.448 --> 28:21.701
It's better than our real lives,
and in this life,

28:21.992 --> 28:25.246
Laurel is alive, my parents are alive.

28:25.454 --> 28:27.172
But those are not your parents.

28:27.331 --> 28:30.881
They remember the only lullaby that would
actually work to put me to sleep.

28:31.710 --> 28:34.338
They remember every day of my life, okay?

28:34.755 --> 28:36.803
They even smell like them, Ollie.

28:36.965 --> 28:38.387
They're not them, Thea.

28:40.510 --> 28:42.512
I want them to be,

28:43.639 --> 28:44.982
but they're not.

28:48.310 --> 28:49.653
Where are John and Ray?

28:49.811 --> 28:51.313
They're waiting outside.

28:52.314 --> 28:53.657
Give us a few minutes?

28:56.944 --> 29:00.699
We can't stay here, Speedy.
No matter how much we want to, we can't.

29:01.156 --> 29:02.282
Why not?

29:04.326 --> 29:07.170
What is waiting for us
wherever we are right now?

29:08.580 --> 29:10.628
Nothing, nothing but

29:11.625 --> 29:13.673
pain and suffering.

29:13.835 --> 29:16.759
Thea, we have responsibilities,
we have people who count on us.

29:17.005 --> 29:18.348
There's Flash,

29:18.966 --> 29:23.221
and Supergirl and people
with actual powers now.

29:24.054 --> 29:26.432
Whatever needs to be done,
they can handle it.

29:28.934 --> 29:29.935
We...

29:30.310 --> 29:33.530
We finally have a chance to be happy.

29:35.983 --> 29:39.578
I mean, why can't you just,
for a second, accept that maybe

29:39.736 --> 29:43.206
this is your reward
for all of the sacrifices you have made?

29:44.449 --> 29:47.794
I didn't make those sacrifices
for a reward, Thea.

29:49.371 --> 29:51.544
I did what I did
because I thought it was right.

29:53.750 --> 29:57.129
And seeing all of this has just,
it has shown me

29:57.296 --> 30:00.391
that there is still so much more to do,
so, please,

30:01.717 --> 30:05.062
I'm begging you to come with me
because I cannot do it alone.

30:12.519 --> 30:13.941
I can't lose them again.

30:16.064 --> 30:17.691
I can't lose my family.

30:23.822 --> 30:24.914
Okay.

30:25.365 --> 30:27.663
Okay. All right. Just...

30:31.538 --> 30:34.542
I want you to be well,
I want you to be happy.

30:35.959 --> 30:37.256
I love you, Thea.

30:54.936 --> 30:55.937
Where's Thea?

30:57.439 --> 30:58.531
Thea's staying.

30:59.358 --> 31:00.826
Have you explained to Ray
what we have to do?

31:00.984 --> 31:02.952
Yeah, apparently we have
to get to an office tower

31:03.111 --> 31:05.079
that my non-fiancee doesn't own,
which is a little strange.

31:05.238 --> 31:08.208
All that, coming from the guy who's been
having memories that he's able to shrink.

31:08.367 --> 31:09.960
Well, whatever we're doing,
we have to do it fast,

31:10.118 --> 31:11.745
because whatever the Dominators
have done to us,

31:11.912 --> 31:13.630
they would've built in safeguards

31:13.789 --> 31:17.214
that are probably manifestations from
our memories designed to keep us here.

31:34.476 --> 31:35.648
They're not real.

31:35.977 --> 31:39.447
Well, they certainly look real,
but let's not get into that right now.

31:42.067 --> 31:43.284
Speedy?

31:43.985 --> 31:45.953
Yeah, I had a change of heart, okay?

31:46.446 --> 31:47.698
Like I said,

31:48.365 --> 31:49.992
I can't lose my family again.

32:00.168 --> 32:03.342
Your father's still alive, Thea.
Your real father, at least.

32:07.008 --> 32:09.852
Unfortunately, this is gonna be
a little less satisfying for me

32:10.011 --> 32:11.263
than killing your sister.

33:17.245 --> 33:18.337
Ollie!

33:29.257 --> 33:30.349
<i>Ollie!</i>

33:34.930 --> 33:36.022
Sara, Sara,

33:36.223 --> 33:37.440
what's going on here?

33:37.641 --> 33:40.315
Laurel, look, I can't explain but

33:41.520 --> 33:44.069
I have to go. We have to go.

33:44.481 --> 33:45.733
What?

33:46.358 --> 33:48.861
No, no, no, whatever it is, we can fix it.

33:50.195 --> 33:51.447
Look, we can't.

33:53.949 --> 33:55.747
Some things you just can't fix.

34:02.624 --> 34:04.001
Ollie? Ollie.

34:04.209 --> 34:05.631
Ollie, what's happening?

34:05.794 --> 34:06.841
What...

34:07.462 --> 34:08.679
I'm sorry.

34:10.799 --> 34:12.597
The person you fell in love with,

34:14.427 --> 34:15.679
it's not me.

34:16.972 --> 34:18.815
And I never deserved that love,

34:22.060 --> 34:23.812
and you always deserved better.

34:26.063 --> 34:27.281
Please.

34:32.152 --> 34:33.324
I love you.

34:33.655 --> 34:35.828
I love you. Don't... Don't go.

34:50.130 --> 34:51.552
Okay, John. What now?

34:51.797 --> 34:53.846
Guys, I don't think that belongs there.

34:54.426 --> 34:56.393
Okay, that's either the way out of here,

34:56.553 --> 34:58.521
or we gotta click our heels together
three times and say,

34:58.680 --> 35:00.557
- "There's no place like home."
- And if that doesn't work?

35:00.724 --> 35:03.227
It has to work. He's running out of time.

35:03.810 --> 35:04.902
Come on.

35:08.315 --> 35:12.365
<i>You're never without me,
my beautiful boy.</i>

35:13.695 --> 35:17.620
<i>There's nothing else to say,
except I could not be more proud.</i>

35:18.033 --> 35:21.207
<i>You've become someone else,
you've become something else.</i>

35:21.369 --> 35:24.714
<i>You honor the dead by fighting,
and you are not done fighting!</i>

35:25.040 --> 35:27.964
<i>I know I called you a murderer,
but you are not,</i>

35:28.209 --> 35:29.836
<i>you are a hero.</i>

35:30.003 --> 35:32.176
<i>You saved my life.
You gave me purpose.</i>

35:32.339 --> 35:33.591
<i>This time, we had to save you.</i>

35:33.757 --> 35:36.306
<i>I know who you are
in your bones, Oliver,</i>

35:36.468 --> 35:38.015
<i>and that person doesn't give up.</i>

35:38.219 --> 35:39.971
<i>ROBERT". This is your responsibility now.</i>

35:54.569 --> 35:55.866
Where are we?

35:56.279 --> 35:57.405
You all right?

35:57.572 --> 36:00.246
It may not be real, but it still hurts
like a son of a bitch.

36:00.784 --> 36:01.876
Uh, guys?

36:03.411 --> 36:05.254
There's something you really need to see.

36:05.622 --> 36:07.966
Any luck with the regulator
we took off CyberWoman?

36:08.500 --> 36:10.878
"CyberWoman"?
I think I'm starting to like you guys.

36:11.044 --> 36:14.469
The regulator worked,
but my translator did not.

36:14.631 --> 36:18.431
The only thing I got back
from the Dominator tech was soup.

36:18.677 --> 36:21.055
What? What, no, no, no, no, this...

36:22.222 --> 36:24.145
- No, this just looks random.
- It's not.

36:24.891 --> 36:25.892
It's Gematria.

36:26.393 --> 36:29.146
- Huh?
- Gematria is the numerology of...

36:29.312 --> 36:31.565
Of the Torah. How did I not see that?

36:31.773 --> 36:35.494
For the gentiles and those of us who
actually had social lives in high school,

36:35.944 --> 36:37.446
what the hell are you talking about?

36:37.612 --> 36:40.491
In Hebrew, each letter possesses
a numerical value.

36:40.782 --> 36:43.831
Gematria is the calculation
of the numerical equivalence

36:43.993 --> 36:45.540
of letters, words, or phrases.

36:45.745 --> 36:50.046
You mean the Dominators' language
is based off the Old Testament?

36:50.291 --> 36:52.134
Or shares commonalities, at least.

36:52.794 --> 36:55.638
You wanted proof of a
"divine plan to the universe," right?

36:55.797 --> 36:58.471
Guys, I'm getting references
to five Terran captives here.

36:58.633 --> 37:00.226
Okay, the signal is coming from...

37:00.927 --> 37:02.395
That's not possible.

37:02.721 --> 37:05.600
"-3.127 latitude,

37:05.765 --> 37:08.860
"-23.7987 longitude..."

37:09.018 --> 37:10.486
That doesn't make any sense.

37:10.645 --> 37:12.647
Geographical coordinates
don't have any negative numbers.

37:12.814 --> 37:14.316
I mean, they do, only when...

37:16.609 --> 37:18.486
Oh, my God, I think I know where they are.

37:47.849 --> 37:51.069
Okay, so how do we find our way
out of an alien spacecraft?

37:51.227 --> 37:53.776
This way. Even though
it's an alien technology,

37:53.980 --> 37:56.153
certain principles of design
are universal.

38:00.361 --> 38:01.578
Or not.

38:09.996 --> 38:11.168
Ray was right,

38:11.331 --> 38:13.675
certain principles of design
are universal.

38:23.718 --> 38:25.561
You think you can fly one of these things?

38:25.720 --> 38:27.393
I'm hoping that between
you, me, Ray, and Sara,

38:27.555 --> 38:29.228
someone can fly one of these things.

38:38.233 --> 38:39.359
Okay, now what?

38:39.609 --> 38:40.656
Ray?

38:40.819 --> 38:43.572
Um, now might be a good time
to find the owner's manual.

38:52.914 --> 38:56.214
And Morn said I wouldn't amount
to anything if I didn't go to college.

39:25.363 --> 39:28.037
Uh, really hope you hit autopilot 'cause
I don't see any controls on this thing.

39:28.199 --> 39:29.451
Hold on, we got incoming.

39:29.617 --> 39:30.869
How do you know?

39:33.162 --> 39:34.288
Lucky guess?

39:45.091 --> 39:48.186
We need to find a way to steer this thing,
or we're not gonna last very long.

40:10.575 --> 40:13.169
Oliver, nice clothes.
Shop at an alien Gap?

40:13.870 --> 40:15.838
- Not funny.
- Well, lucky for you guys,

40:15.997 --> 40:19.046
the <i>Waverider</i> has a machine that
replicates old clothes and weapons.

40:19.208 --> 40:20.960
- Hi, I'm Nate Heywood.
- Hi! Thea.

40:21.127 --> 40:24.848
And this is exactly twice as many
spaceships as I ever thought I'd be on.

40:25.006 --> 40:26.508
Well, actually, it's a time-ship.

40:26.674 --> 40:27.766
How'd you find us?

40:27.926 --> 40:30.020
I didn't. Your nerd army
back on Earth did.

40:30.178 --> 40:33.022
I'm gonna take Digg to the Medbay,
have Gideon fix him up.

40:33.181 --> 40:34.558
Whoever Gideon is.

40:36.976 --> 40:39.195
- Get out!
- Thanks for the save.

40:39.354 --> 40:40.480
No problem.

40:40.688 --> 40:42.110
Except for all our other problems.

40:42.273 --> 40:43.399
Like what, Ray?

40:44.192 --> 40:45.193
After we woke up,

40:45.360 --> 40:48.409
I got a look at the tech the Dominators
were using to keep us under.

40:48.821 --> 40:52.542
They're using a neuromorphic interface
similar to how I manipulate the Atom suit.

40:52.700 --> 40:54.794
And, wait... What does that mean?

40:54.994 --> 40:56.166
I think,

40:56.329 --> 40:59.003
the shared hallucination
was to keep our minds occupied

40:59.165 --> 41:01.042
- while the Dominators...
- While the Dominators what?

41:01.209 --> 41:03.382
Well, while they probed our subconscious.

41:03.544 --> 41:05.046
I'm guessing, looking for intel.

41:06.589 --> 41:08.717
Wait, maybe they didn't choose us
at random.

41:08.925 --> 41:11.644
Maybe they chose us
because we couldn't fight back.

41:12.136 --> 41:13.888
Because none of you are meta-humans.

41:14.055 --> 41:15.898
Bigger question,
what intel were they after?

41:16.057 --> 41:17.149
What is their plan?

41:20.561 --> 41:21.687
Gesundheit!

41:21.896 --> 41:24.399
It's what one of the Dominators
said to another.

41:24.565 --> 41:28.069
Which sounds like the beginning
of a not so funny joke, but... Gideon?

41:28.319 --> 41:29.411
<i>Translating.</i>

41:31.364 --> 41:33.742
You ever think that our lives
would really get this weird?

41:33.908 --> 41:35.751
<i>The phrase loosely translates to,</i>

41:35.910 --> 41:37.662
<i>"We are nearing completion of the weapon. "</i>

41:37.829 --> 41:38.830
What weapon?

41:38.997 --> 41:40.499
<i>I'm afraid I have no idea,</i>

41:40.665 --> 41:43.418
<i>but I'm tracking the Dominator mothership
you escaped from.</i>

41:43.584 --> 41:47.088
<i>And it appears to be on a direct course
for Earth.</i>
