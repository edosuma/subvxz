WEBVTT

00:00.371 --> 00:03.034
(squeals)

00:03.034 --> 00:05.236
HYAH!

00:05.236 --> 00:07.238
I THINK IT'S A TIE.

00:07.238 --> 00:10.081
YOU'RE KIDDING ME. MY KICK
IS SO MUCH HIGHER THAN HIS.

00:10.081 --> 00:12.213
I KNEW WE SHOULD HAVE GOTTEN
A REAL JUDGE FOR THIS. (sighs)

00:12.213 --> 00:15.046
SO... NATHAN WAS BULLIED
AT SCHOOL YESTERDAY.

00:15.046 --> 00:17.188
WHAT?!
NO ONE PICKS ON MY NEPHEW.

00:17.188 --> 00:18.349
WE SHOULD DO SOMETHING.

00:18.349 --> 00:20.121
THAT'S WHAT I THOUGHT, TOO,

00:20.121 --> 00:22.223
BUT THEN THERESA AND I
TALKED ABOUT IT,

00:22.223 --> 00:23.394
AND SHE HELPED ME REALIZE THAT

00:23.394 --> 00:27.158
MY THOUGHTS, FEELINGS,
AND OPINIONS WERE... WRONG.

00:27.158 --> 00:29.200
THAT IS A LESSON
YOU KEEP LEARNING, MY FRIEND.

00:29.200 --> 00:31.202
WE TOLD NATHAN THE BEST WAY
TO DEAL WITH THE BULLY

00:31.202 --> 00:32.203
IS TO IGNORE HIM.

00:32.203 --> 00:35.166
THE HIGH ROAD IS THE GUY ROAD.

00:35.166 --> 00:38.409
WE ALSO TRIED TO COME UP WITH
A RHYME TO MAKE IT SOUND COOL.

00:38.409 --> 00:40.341
YOU DID NOT SUCCEED.

00:40.341 --> 00:42.273
WHEN I WAS BULLIED IN SCHOOL,
MY DAD MADE ME CONFRONT THE GUY,

00:42.273 --> 00:44.345
AND THEN THE GUY BEAT ME UP
AGAIN FOR CONFRONTING HIM,

00:44.345 --> 00:46.117
AND SO MY DAD MADE ME
CONFRONT HIM AGAIN,

00:46.117 --> 00:48.048
AND THEN THE GUY
BEAT ME UP AGAIN,

00:48.048 --> 00:49.250
AND THEN MY DAD THREW
AN EMPTY BEER CAN AT ME

00:49.250 --> 00:51.322
FOR USING THE PHRASE
"VICIOUS CYCLE."

00:51.322 --> 00:54.385
(whispers) CLASSIC.
MY OLD MAN ALSO BELIEVED
IN CONFRONTATION,

00:54.385 --> 00:58.129
BUT THERESA HELPED ME REALIZE
THAT "IT'S A DIFFERENT AGE.

00:58.129 --> 01:00.291
NO NEED FOR RAGE."

01:00.291 --> 01:02.093
I HATE YOUR RHYMES
A WHOLE DAMN BUNCH,

01:02.093 --> 01:08.339
SO CRAIG AND I...
ARE OFF TO LUNCH.

01:08.339 --> 01:10.371
SO...

01:10.371 --> 01:14.145
I HEAR YOU GOT PICKED ON
BY SOME NE'ER-DO-WELL AT SCHOOL.

01:14.145 --> 01:16.277
WHAT'D HE DO,
LAUGH AT YOUR FUNNY GLASSES?

01:16.277 --> 01:19.350
YOUR GOOFY HAIRCUT?
YOUR HEIGHT? THE WAY YOU TALK?

01:19.350 --> 01:21.382
KENNY.
SORRY.

01:21.382 --> 01:23.354
IT WAS YOUR EARS, WASN'T IT?

01:23.354 --> 01:27.358
NO. HE SAID THAT I LOOKED LIKE
THE IGUANA IN OUR BIOLOGY CLASS.

01:27.358 --> 01:29.160
THEN HE PUSHED ME DOWN.

01:29.160 --> 01:30.391
WHOA, WHOA.WHAT?

01:30.391 --> 01:31.462
UNBELIEVABLE.

01:31.462 --> 01:33.424
YOU HAVE AN IGUANA
IN YOUR BIOLOGY CLASS?

01:33.424 --> 01:35.166
UM, YEAH.

01:35.166 --> 01:36.227
ANYWAY, SO AFTER
HE PUSHED ME DOWN,

01:36.227 --> 01:38.098
HE THREW MY BACKPACK
IN THE TRASH CAN.

01:38.098 --> 01:39.170
(sighs)

01:39.170 --> 01:40.471
COLD-BLOODED.
BIG-TIME.

01:40.471 --> 01:42.133
I'M SAYING REPTILES
ARE COLD-BLOODED.

01:42.133 --> 01:43.234
HAVE YOU TOUCHED THIS THING?

01:43.234 --> 01:45.306
I PICTURE IT SLIPPERY
BUT NOT SLIMY.

01:45.306 --> 01:48.179
FORGET THE IGUANA.
WHO IS THIS KID?

01:48.179 --> 01:51.111
DOESN'T MATTER WHO THE KID IS.
SITUATION'S BEEN DEFUSED.
(door opens and closes)

01:51.111 --> 01:53.384
KID? ARE WE TRASHING A KID?
'CAUSE I WANT IN.

01:53.384 --> 01:55.115
THERE IS NO KID.

01:55.115 --> 01:56.287
I HEARD YOU TALKING ABOUT A KID
WHEN WE WALKED IN.

01:56.287 --> 01:57.318
MM.

01:57.318 --> 01:59.320
I HAVE ACUTE SENSES. (sniffs)

01:59.320 --> 02:01.322
AND ALSO,
CRAIG SWITCHED SHAMPOOS.

02:01.322 --> 02:04.124
MAN, I HATE BULLIES.

02:04.124 --> 02:07.228
THEY'RE MEAN, INSENSITIVE,
AND AGGRESSIVE.

02:07.228 --> 02:08.329
NOW WHO'S THEPUNK

02:08.329 --> 02:11.462
THAT SAID MY NEPHEW WALKS
LIKE ADUCK?!

02:11.462 --> 02:13.404
ALL RIGHT, KIDS, MOMMY'S
ABOUT TO FREAK OUT THE ADULTS.

02:13.404 --> 02:15.506
GO WAIT OUTSIDE FOR AUNT BRENDA
TO TAKE YOU TO SCHOOL.

02:15.506 --> 02:17.508
(door opens and closes)

02:17.508 --> 02:19.370
LOOK, THE NAME OF THE KID
IS NOT IMPORTANT,

02:19.370 --> 02:22.243
BUT THE MOTHER IS
INCREDIBLYIMPORTANT.

02:22.243 --> 02:24.415
SHE IS A VERY INFLUENTIAL MEMBER
OF THE SCHOOL BOARD,

02:24.415 --> 02:26.217
AND I NEED HER ON MY SIDE

02:26.217 --> 02:29.380
BECAUSE I AM LOBBYING THEM THIS
WEEK TO SAVE THE SCIENCE CLUB.

02:29.380 --> 02:31.382
WHAT?!
SCIENCE CLUB'S IN TROUBLE?!

02:31.382 --> 02:32.523
(gasps loudly) I'M SORRY.

02:32.523 --> 02:34.185
I'M TRYING TO FREAK OUT
ABOUT THIS.

02:34.185 --> 02:35.286
I'M JUST NOT FEELING IT.

02:35.286 --> 02:36.457
WAIT A MINUTE.

02:36.457 --> 02:39.159
YOU'RE NOT SUCKING UP
TO SHARON EASTERLING, ARE YOU?

02:39.159 --> 02:40.291
I WOULDN'T SAY "SUCKING UP."

02:40.291 --> 02:42.293
I'M MERELY SHOWERING HER
WITH UNNECESSARY COMPLIMENTS

02:42.293 --> 02:44.465
AND GIFT CARDS
TO ACHIEVE MY GOALS.

02:44.465 --> 02:45.536
OHH, PERFECT.

02:45.536 --> 02:47.498
SUCKING UP,
JUST LIKE HIGH SCHOOL.

02:47.498 --> 02:50.170
THAT'S NOT TRUE.
SHARON AND I WERE FRIENDS.

02:50.170 --> 02:52.343
YEAH? WELL, YOURFRIEND
SPREAD THE RUMOR

02:52.343 --> 02:54.375
THAT I MADE OUT
WITH THE SCHOOL JANITOR,

02:54.375 --> 02:56.347
AND YOU NEVER STOOD UP FOR ME.

02:56.347 --> 02:58.509
WELL, THE TWO OF YOU DID HAVE
COLD SORES AT THE SAME TIME.

02:58.509 --> 03:00.511
IT WAS A COINCIDENCE.

03:00.511 --> 03:04.555
WE JUST BOTH MADE OUT WITH THAT
FRENCH EXCHANGE STUDENT PIERRE.

03:04.555 --> 03:06.357
SO PEOPLE THINK YOU SLEPT

03:06.357 --> 03:08.489
WITH SOME SUPER OLD,
BISEXUAL CUSTODIAN.

03:08.489 --> 03:10.391
LET ITGO.

03:10.391 --> 03:12.423
ISHOULD LET IT GO?
DO YOU KNOW

03:12.423 --> 03:14.525
WHO SHARON EASTERLING
IS MARRIED TO?

03:14.525 --> 03:16.527
AND THIS IS WHERE
THE ADULTS FREAK OUT.

03:16.527 --> 03:18.269
DENNIS MAYDER.

03:18.269 --> 03:19.470
(pounds countertop)
MAYDER!

03:19.470 --> 03:21.332
AAH!

03:21.332 --> 03:24.275
OH! THE BULLY'S DAD
IS DENNIS MAYDER?!

03:24.275 --> 03:26.307
DENNIS MAYDER?

03:26.307 --> 03:29.380
SO THAT'S WHY YOU DIDN'T WANT
TO TELL ME WHO THE DAD WAS.

03:29.380 --> 03:31.382
MAY I BE HONEST WITH YOU ALL?

03:31.382 --> 03:33.213
THERE ARE TIMES
WHEN YOUR SHARED HISTORY

03:33.213 --> 03:34.545
MAKES ME FEEL LIKE AN OUTSIDER.

03:34.545 --> 03:37.388
DENNIS MAYDER WAS
THE BIGGEST JERK IN JUNIOR HIGH.

03:37.388 --> 03:39.250
THANK YOU.
I FEEL BETTER ALREADY.
YEAH.

03:39.250 --> 03:41.352
DENNIS WAS ALWAYS SAYING STUFF
THAT GOT IN YOUR HEAD,

03:41.352 --> 03:44.255
LIKE--LIKE I HAD LADY HIPS

03:44.255 --> 03:46.226
AND THAT'S WHY
I COULDN'T RUN FAST.

03:46.226 --> 03:49.300
(whistles)

03:49.300 --> 03:51.231
I KNOW. IT'S INSANE.

03:51.231 --> 03:52.503
CLASSIC MAYDER.

03:52.503 --> 03:54.365
SO THE BULLY HAD A LITTLE BULLY.

03:54.365 --> 03:57.308
I'M GONNA TALK TO DENNIS.
IT'S TIME TO BREAK THIS CYCLE.

03:57.308 --> 04:00.341
YEAH, WE SHOULD DO SOMETHING--
SOMETHIN' STUPID.

04:00.341 --> 04:01.442
LISTEN TO ME.

04:01.442 --> 04:02.573
NATHAN AND THE MAYDER KID
HAD A LITTLE INCIDENT,

04:02.573 --> 04:04.375
AND NOW IT IS OVER,
AND I NEED SHARON ON MY SIDE

04:04.375 --> 04:06.377
BECAUSE NATHAN LOVES
THAT SCIENCE CLUB.

04:06.377 --> 04:09.380
SONOBODYIS DOING ANYTHING.

04:09.380 --> 04:12.323
FINE. THAT GUY GETS TO ME.

04:12.323 --> 04:16.587
YOU KNOW, HE ONCE SAID THAT
MY HEAD WAS, LIKE, 98% FACE.

04:16.587 --> 04:18.489
I KNOW.

04:18.489 --> 04:21.432
IT'S INSANE.

04:21.432 --> 04:23.634
TARGET ACQUIRED.

04:23.634 --> 04:26.266
I'M GONNA GO SCARE THE HELL
OUT OF THAT KID.

04:26.266 --> 04:28.599
I'M GONNA GO TOUCH
THAT IGUANA.

04:28.599 --> 04:30.270
(imitates explosion)

04:30.270 --> 04:31.372
(children yelling playfully)

04:31.372 --> 04:32.443
(Kenny) HEY!

04:33.644 --> 04:37.408
YOU D.J. MAYDER? THE KID
THAT BULLIED NATHAN KEEN?

04:37.408 --> 04:39.410
YEAH.
HE'S MY NEPHEW.

04:39.410 --> 04:41.482
OH, I SEE WHERE HE GETS
HIS GIANT EARS FROM.

04:41.482 --> 04:43.454
YOU BETTER WATCH YOUR MOUTH,
PUNK.

04:43.454 --> 04:44.485
OR WHAT?

04:44.485 --> 04:47.358
OR MAYBE I WATCH ITFORYOU.

04:47.358 --> 04:50.361
YOU WANNA STARE AT MY MOUTH?
WHAT KIND OF A PERSON ARE YOU?

04:50.361 --> 04:52.323
WHAT? NO!
YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN.

04:52.323 --> 04:54.395
WHAT,
THAT YOU'RE GONNA HIT ME?

04:54.395 --> 04:55.626
UH, MAYBE!

04:55.626 --> 04:57.368
I'M A KID.

04:57.368 --> 04:59.500
YOU TOUCH ME,
YOU GO RIGHT TO JAIL.

04:59.500 --> 05:02.403
COME ON.DOSOMETHIN'.

05:02.403 --> 05:04.304
DO SOMETHIN'!

05:08.609 --> 05:10.541
I'M GONNA TOUCH YOU.

05:10.541 --> 05:13.384
I'M SORRY. CAN I HELP YOU?

05:13.384 --> 05:16.487
OH, NO, I JUST CAME TO, UH--
OH, YOU MUST BE BRANDON'S DAD.

05:16.487 --> 05:18.489
I'M SORRY.
DID YOU NOT GET MY MESSAGE?

05:18.489 --> 05:21.492
I HAD TO CANCEL OUR MEETING
TODAY. I HAVE JUST BEEN SWAMPED.

05:21.492 --> 05:23.424
NO, NO. I JUST--I WAS--
I'D LOVE TO FIND SOME TIME

05:23.424 --> 05:26.397
WHEN YOU AND I CAN SIT
AND TALK ABOUT BRANDON.

05:26.397 --> 05:28.328
HE'S BEEN A LITTLE QUIET
IN CLASS LATELY,

05:28.328 --> 05:31.632
PROBABLY BECAUSE OF...
YOUR DIVORCE.

05:31.632 --> 05:33.604
(chuckles) LOOK,
I GOTTA BE HONEST WITH YOU,

05:33.604 --> 05:35.366
UM...

05:36.537 --> 05:41.412
THIS DIVORCE HAS BEEN HARD
ON ALL OF US.

05:44.545 --> 05:46.417
I JUST MET
THE CUTEST TEACHER,

05:46.417 --> 05:49.420
AND SHE AND I ARE GOING
TO DINNER TOGETHER.

05:49.420 --> 05:52.653
ALSO, I HAVE A SON NAMED BRANDON
AND HE'S STRUGGLING.

05:54.385 --> 05:55.456
(seat belt clicks)

05:55.456 --> 05:57.388
YOU OKAY?

05:57.388 --> 05:59.460
THAT MAYDER KID IS SO MEAN.

05:59.460 --> 06:00.731
HE SAID I LOVE TURDS.

06:00.731 --> 06:03.363
BUT YOU HATE TURDS.

06:03.363 --> 06:04.635
I KNOW!

06:04.635 --> 06:08.368
SO THAT ALSO MAKES HIM
ALIAR!
(starts engine)

06:08.368 --> 06:10.370
(tires peal)

06:10.370 --> 06:12.543
HEY. WHERE'S MOM?

06:12.543 --> 06:13.604
OH, SHE'S JUST INSIDE,

06:13.604 --> 06:16.607
HANGING FLIERS FOR THAT, UH,
SCHOOL BOARD THING.

06:16.607 --> 06:20.451
SO TELL ME, HOW WAS IT TODAY?
DID D.J. PICK ON YOU?

06:20.451 --> 06:21.582
NO, IT WAS FINE.

06:21.582 --> 06:23.454
HE EVEN APOLOGIZED TO ME
AFTER CLASS.

06:23.454 --> 06:25.516
I THINK MOM CALLED HIS MOM
OR SOMETHING.

06:25.516 --> 06:28.459
OKAY. WELL, SEE?

06:28.459 --> 06:29.690
THE HIGH ROAD IS THE GUY--
(smack)

06:29.690 --> 06:31.692
(ball bouncing)
WHAT THE HELL?

06:31.692 --> 06:33.564
OH, I'M SORRY. ONE OF MY BALLS
HIT YOUR FACE.

06:33.564 --> 06:35.726
YOU WANNA HAVE YOUR WIFE CALL
MY WIFE TO COMPLAIN ABOUT IT?

06:35.726 --> 06:37.668
DENNIS MAYDER.

06:37.668 --> 06:38.769
UH-HUH, THAT'S RIGHT.

06:38.769 --> 06:40.631
AND DENNIS MAYDER
WOULD APPRECIATE

06:40.631 --> 06:43.434
IF IN THE FUTURE
OUR KIDS HAVE A PROBLEM,

06:43.434 --> 06:45.436
YOU CALL ME DIRECTLY,
DEAL WITH IT LIKE A MAN.

06:45.436 --> 06:48.509
WHAT'S UP, BUDDY?
I GOT NO BEEF WITH YOU, OKAY?

06:48.509 --> 06:50.541
HERE'S A JUICE BOX.

06:50.541 --> 06:52.483
THIS ISN'T JUICE.

06:52.483 --> 06:54.785
THIS IS JUICE DRINK.
AND WE PREFER NATHAN DOESN'T

06:54.785 --> 06:56.547
HAVE THESE TYPES
OF SUGARY BEVERAGES

06:56.547 --> 06:58.719
UNLESS IT'S A SPECIAL OCCASION.

06:58.719 --> 07:00.491
(juice box thuds)
GOOD ONE, DAD.

07:00.491 --> 07:03.494
HEY, ANYBODY EVER TELL YOU,
YOU LOOK LIKE CURIOUS GEORGE?

07:03.494 --> 07:05.726
OH! REALLY?
(mouths words)

07:05.726 --> 07:08.428
WELL, DID ANYBODY
EVER TELLYOU...THAT...

07:08.428 --> 07:12.463
THAT THE HIGH ROAD
IS THE GUY ROAD?

07:12.463 --> 07:13.534
HEY, D-MAN.

07:13.534 --> 07:14.665
OOH.
GIVE A HUG, LADY BUG.

07:14.665 --> 07:15.766
MMM.

07:15.766 --> 07:17.708
OOH.

07:17.708 --> 07:21.542
GIVE A SMOOCH,
LADY... POOCH.

07:24.775 --> 07:26.547
OKAY.

07:26.547 --> 07:28.649
GUESS WHO I RAN INTO AND INVITED
OVER FOR DINNER TOMORROW

07:28.649 --> 07:30.621
TO TALK ABOUT SCIENCE CLUB?

07:30.621 --> 07:31.822
REMEMBER HOW IMPORTANT
THAT IS TO NATHAN,

07:31.822 --> 07:34.585
BECAUSE HE LOVES SCIENCE?
AND TO ME?

07:34.585 --> 07:35.686
AND YOU'RE GOING TO DO IT?

07:35.686 --> 07:38.559
OR MAYBE WE DECIDE TO GO
IN ANOTHER DIRECTION?

07:38.559 --> 07:43.664
AND THEN WE CIRCLE BACK AND DO
EXACTLY WHAT YOU WANNA DO?

07:43.664 --> 07:45.536
I'M IN.

07:45.536 --> 07:48.539
(Dennis, Sharon,
and Theresa laugh)

07:55.475 --> 07:57.608
IT'S NOT THAT BRANDON'S
NOT A GOOD BOY.

07:57.608 --> 07:59.550
ARE YOU KIDDING ME?
HE'S THE BEST, THAT KID.

07:59.550 --> 08:01.111
OHH! I LOVE HIM.

08:01.111 --> 08:04.184
I THINK HE'S JUST HAVING
A LITTLE TROUBLE RIGHT NOW.

08:04.184 --> 08:06.086
YEAH, WE'RE ALL HAVING
A LITTLE TROUBLE RIGHT NOW.

08:06.086 --> 08:08.118
FOR HIM, IT'S FOCUSING
ON HIS SCHOOLWORK.

08:08.118 --> 08:10.561
FOR ME, IT'S HAVING NO ONE THERE
TO BAKE BREAD FOR,

08:10.561 --> 08:12.623
LOOK AT A SUNSET WITH,

08:12.623 --> 08:15.195
LIE NEXT TO
BY A CRACKLING FIRE.

08:15.195 --> 08:16.567
REALLY?
YOU BAKE YOUR OWN BREAD?

08:16.567 --> 08:19.570
WELL, IT'S A HOBBY OF MINE.
I HAVE A FEW.

08:19.570 --> 08:21.572
I PLAY SOME INSTRUMENTS,
ORGANIC GARDENING,

08:21.572 --> 08:23.203
ALWAYS FIX ANYTHING
AROUND THE HOUSE RIGHT AWAY

08:23.203 --> 08:25.105
IF IT BREAKS.

08:25.105 --> 08:28.508
YOU'RE A FASCINATING MAN,
BRUCE.

08:28.508 --> 08:30.541
PLEASE, CALL ME CRAIG.

08:30.541 --> 08:32.242
WHY?

08:32.242 --> 08:35.245
IT'S A NICKNAME.

08:35.245 --> 08:38.589
SO THEN MAYDER TELLS ME--
GET THIS--

08:38.589 --> 08:40.551
THAT I LOOK LIKE
CURIOUS GEORGE.

08:41.592 --> 08:44.154
I KNOW. IT'S INSANE.

08:44.154 --> 08:45.696
AND NOW I HAVE TO
HAVE DINNER WITH THIS GUY.

08:45.696 --> 08:47.658
I SWEAR,
IF THERESA DIDN'T NEED

08:47.658 --> 08:50.200
THIS SCHOOL BOARD THING
TO GO WELL, I WOULD DECK HIM.

08:50.200 --> 08:52.633
YOU KNOW WHO I'D DECK?
THAT BASTARD KID OF HIS.

08:52.633 --> 08:54.204
THE BABY?

08:54.204 --> 08:58.138
NO, NOT THE BABY.
D.J.--DUMB JERK.

08:58.138 --> 08:59.610
OH, I SHOULD HAVE SAID THAT!

08:59.610 --> 09:01.612
I HAVE A SUGGESTION.

09:01.612 --> 09:04.544
IT SEEMS THAT DENNIS TRIES TO
GET THE BEST OF YOU WITH HIS...

09:04.544 --> 09:08.548
RIDICULOUSLY UNTRUE COMMENTS
ABOUT YOUR PHYSICAL APPEARANCE.

09:08.548 --> 09:10.581
MAYBE YOU SHOULD
TRY TO DEFEAT HIM

09:10.581 --> 09:12.723
BY USING HIS ENERGY
AGAINST HIM.

09:12.723 --> 09:15.155
WOW. THAT'S PRETTY DEEP.

09:15.155 --> 09:16.556
IS THAT SOME SORT
OF EASTERN THING?

09:16.556 --> 09:19.690
YES. I LEARNED IT
FROM A SHERPA NAMED MOMO.

09:19.690 --> 09:21.161
HUH.

09:21.161 --> 09:22.633
HE CUTS THE GRASS
AT MY APARTMENT BUILDING.

09:22.633 --> 09:26.236
WILL, IF YOU AGREE
WITH WHATEVER DENNIS SAYS,

09:26.236 --> 09:29.700
YOU WILL DULL HIS MAIN ATTACK
BLADE, RENDERING HIM IMPOTENT.

09:29.700 --> 09:32.703
USE HIS ENERGY AGAINST HIM...

09:32.703 --> 09:35.275
THAT MAKES SENSE!

09:35.275 --> 09:40.250
GENTLEMEN, TONIGHT
I AM GONNA MAKE A MAN IMPOTENT.

09:40.250 --> 09:41.712
(door closes)

09:41.712 --> 09:43.654
(sighs) AND, KENNY?

09:43.654 --> 09:46.186
YOU NEED TO GET
REVENGE ON THAT KID.

09:47.217 --> 09:48.759
SERIOUSLY?

09:48.759 --> 09:50.260
(laughs) YES!

09:50.260 --> 09:52.222
BUT YOU JUST SAID
THAT WILL SHOULD--

09:52.222 --> 09:54.264
NO, KENNY AND WILL'S PATHS
ARE DIFFERENT.

09:54.264 --> 09:56.767
WILL'S IS THE HIGH ROAD.
KENNY'S IS THE LOW ROAD.

09:56.767 --> 09:59.670
MY PHILOSOPHY IS DO
WHATYOUNEED TO DO TO HEAL.

09:59.670 --> 10:02.703
SEEMS LIKE YOUR PHILOSOPHY JUST
LETS YOU DO WHATEVER YOU WANT.

10:02.703 --> 10:05.736
I ASK THE UNIVERSE,
AND THE UNIVERSE ANSWERS.

10:05.736 --> 10:07.207
SEE, THAT JUST SOUNDS LIKE

10:07.207 --> 10:08.679
YOU'RE DESCRIBING
THE PROCESS OF THINKING.

10:08.679 --> 10:11.341
WHO CARES? HE JUST GAVE ME
THE GREEN LIGHT FOR REVENGE.

10:11.341 --> 10:12.713
OKAY.

10:12.713 --> 10:15.215
WHAT DOES YOUR PHILOSOPHY SAY
ABOUT LYING TO A WOMAN YOU LIKE

10:15.215 --> 10:16.286
ABOUT BEING
THE FATHER OF A CHILD

10:16.286 --> 10:17.648
WHO'S GOING THROUGH
A BRUTAL DIVORCE

10:17.648 --> 10:19.349
ANDMAKING HER THINK
YOU'RE THE SECOND COUSIN

10:19.349 --> 10:21.221
OF THAT REALLY GOOD-LOOKING,
SLEEPY, PALE GUY

10:21.221 --> 10:22.392
FROM THE "TWILIGHT" MOVIES?

10:22.392 --> 10:25.355
THE UNIVERSE WILL NOT STAND IN
THE WAY OF WHAT THE HEART WANTS.

10:25.355 --> 10:29.629
I LIKE THIS UNIVERSE. ALL RIGHT.
KENNY, WHAT'S THE PLAN?

10:29.629 --> 10:31.702
ALL RIGHT, GENTLEMEN,
I GOT FOUR WORDS FOR YOU--

10:31.702 --> 10:34.765
TOY, LET, PAY, PER.

10:34.765 --> 10:36.707
TOY, LET, PAY, PER.

10:36.707 --> 10:38.709
TOY, LET, PAY, PER.

10:38.709 --> 10:40.240
I DON'T KNOW WHAT THAT MEANS.

10:40.240 --> 10:41.311
TOILET PAPER.

10:41.311 --> 10:43.343
OH. IT'S TWO WORDS.

10:43.343 --> 10:45.776
WE ARE GOING TO TOILET PAPER
THIS PUNK'S HOUSE...

10:45.776 --> 10:48.318
DOUBLE PLY. (cackles)

10:48.318 --> 10:49.780
ACTUALLY, THAT'S MORE EXPENSIVE.

10:49.780 --> 10:54.785
SINGLE PLY. (cackles)

10:56.426 --> 10:57.758
THANKS AGAIN
FOR DOING THIS DINNER.

10:57.758 --> 10:59.259
IT'LL ONLY BE
A COUPLE HOURS.

10:59.259 --> 11:00.831
JUST BE KIND,
DON'T LET HIM GET TO YOU--

11:00.831 --> 11:04.664
HONEY, THE LONGER WE TALK,
THE LONGER THE DRUMMING GOES ON.

11:04.664 --> 11:07.738
"HOT FOR TEACHER."
ALEX VAN HALEN. IN YOUR FACE.

11:07.738 --> 11:08.739
HI.
HELLO.

11:08.739 --> 11:09.840
COME ON IN.

11:09.840 --> 11:11.742
HEY. HERE YOU GO.

11:11.742 --> 11:13.704
I WAS GONNA BRING BANANAS,
BUT I FIGURED

11:13.704 --> 11:16.676
YOU GOT PLENTY OF THOSE FROM
THE MAN WITH THE YELLOW HAT.

11:16.676 --> 11:18.308
(chuckles)
THAT'S CLEVER, DENNIS.

11:18.308 --> 11:22.282
BUT I WAS LOOKING IN THE MIRROR
EARLIER, AND YOU KNOW WHAT?

11:22.282 --> 11:24.684
IDOLOOK LIKE
CURIOUS GEORGE.

11:26.356 --> 11:27.687
OH.

11:27.687 --> 11:30.390
WELL, YEAH, YOU DO.

11:30.390 --> 11:34.324
ANYWAY, MIGHT WANT TO
LET THAT MERLOT BREATHE, NERD.

11:44.374 --> 11:46.777
ALL RIGHT, LISTEN UP.
WE ARE IN TOILET PAPER MODE.

11:46.777 --> 11:48.879
THREE ROLLS TO A TREE,
KEEP THE BUNCHING TO A MINIMUM,

11:48.879 --> 11:50.841
WE'RE IN, WE'RE OUT,
STAY FOCUSED, NO DISTRACTIONS.

11:50.841 --> 11:55.385
DUDE, CHECK IT OUT.
DENNIS HAS A SICK MAN CAVE.

11:55.385 --> 11:56.787
OHH.

11:58.418 --> 11:59.790
ALL RIGHT, LISTEN UP.
WE ARE IN MAN CAVE MODE.

11:59.790 --> 12:01.391
WE'RE GONNA PLAY
SOME VIDEO GAMES,

12:01.391 --> 12:02.452
HAVE A COUPLE BEERS,
AND THEN WE'RE OUT OF THERE.

12:02.452 --> 12:03.854
STAY FOCUSED, NO DISTRACTIONS.

12:03.854 --> 12:04.855
(thud)
LET'S GO.

12:06.726 --> 12:10.861
IT'S JUST, SCIENCE CLUB
IS SO IMPORTANT TO MY SON,

12:10.861 --> 12:13.904
AND IT'S CHANGED LIVES. IN FACT,
DO YOU REMEMBER BRENDA CUTTY?

12:13.904 --> 12:17.808
YOU MEAN "SLUTTY CUTTY"?
"THE LEGEND OF BIG-SLUT"?

12:17.808 --> 12:18.839
(laughs)

12:18.839 --> 12:22.512
RIGHT. YOU USED TO
CALL HER THAT.

12:22.512 --> 12:25.776
WELL, SHE WAS SO INSPIRED
BY SCIENCE CLUB

12:25.776 --> 12:28.478
THAT NOW
SHE'S A REGISTERED NURSE.

12:28.478 --> 12:31.481
REMEMBER WHEN SHE GOT
THAT COLD SORE FROM RUDY,

12:31.481 --> 12:33.784
THAT SUPER OLD JANITOR
WHO LIKED TO SWEEP

12:33.784 --> 12:36.486
ON BOTH SIDES OF THE HALLWAY,
IF YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN?

12:36.486 --> 12:37.757
YES!

12:37.757 --> 12:40.460
(both laugh)

12:40.460 --> 12:42.492
THAT WAS SO FUNNY.

12:42.492 --> 12:43.794
SO...

12:43.794 --> 12:45.465
IS YOUR MOM STILL A FATTY?

12:45.465 --> 12:46.837
HUGE.

12:46.837 --> 12:50.400
SHE'S SO FAT, WHEN SHE CUTS
HERSELF, GRAVY COMES OUT.

12:50.400 --> 12:52.772
OKAY. THAT WAS MINE.
I WAS GONNA SAY THAT.

12:52.772 --> 12:54.774
(chuckles)
YEAH.

12:54.774 --> 12:55.946
WHY ARE YOU GRINNING?

12:55.946 --> 12:58.949
I'M HAVING A SURPRISINGLY
GOOD TIME TONIGHT.
HMM.

12:58.949 --> 13:02.512
UH,
THEN IT WOULDN'T ANNOY YOU

13:02.512 --> 13:04.815
IF I MAKE
A LITTLE DOCUMENTARY...
(beep)

13:04.815 --> 13:09.459
ABOUT YOUR LAME HOUSE
AND YOUR PASTY FACE?

13:09.459 --> 13:12.792
OOH, AND ALL THESE
STUPID BASKETS.

13:12.792 --> 13:14.865
ARE THESE BASKETS WHERE YOU KEEP
ALL YOUR UNREALIZED DREAMS?

13:14.865 --> 13:17.828
YEAH. I HAVEN'T ACHIEVED
ANYTHING I SET OUT TO DO.

13:17.828 --> 13:19.469
I'M PRETTY MUCH A FAILURE.

13:19.469 --> 13:21.872
SO HOW DO YOU LIKE
YOUR MEAT, DENNIS?

13:22.903 --> 13:24.404
CHEF'S CHOICE.

13:25.876 --> 13:29.439
IT WAS AMAZING.
GRANT'S ADVICE WORKED PERFECTLY.

13:29.439 --> 13:31.411
IT DROVE DENNIS CRAZY.

13:31.411 --> 13:32.542
LET ME ASK YOU TWO SOMETHING.

13:32.542 --> 13:34.945
DO YOU THINK WE HAVE
TOO MANY BASKETS IN OUR KITCHEN?

13:34.945 --> 13:37.417
I'M NOT GONNA LIE TO YOU.
YOU GOT A LOT OF BASKETS.

13:37.417 --> 13:38.949
IT'S LIKE EASTER SUNDAY
IN THERE.

13:38.949 --> 13:40.550
BUT GUESS WHAT WE DID
LAST NIGHT?

13:40.550 --> 13:43.894
WE WENT OVER TO DENNIS' WITH
144 ROLLS OF TOILET PAPER...

13:43.894 --> 13:47.858
(cackles)
AND THEN WE GOT DISTRACTED.

13:47.858 --> 13:49.960
(dance music playing)
LEFT FOOT, LEFT FOOT,
LEFT FOOT, RIGHT, RIGHT,

13:49.960 --> 13:52.832
CROSS, CROSS, CROSS,
CROSS, CROSS...

13:52.832 --> 13:54.434
YOU GUYS SNUCK IN THERE?

13:54.434 --> 13:55.906
YEAH, WE WERE
TOTALLY INEFFECTIVE.

13:55.906 --> 13:57.507
BUT DON'T WORRY.
WE'RE GOING BACK TONIGHT.

13:57.507 --> 13:58.939
NOT TO T.P., THOUGH.

13:58.939 --> 14:00.540
HE'S GOT A BLU-RAY PLAYER,
SO WE'RE GONNA WATCH A MOVIE.

14:00.540 --> 14:01.611
MAYBE "MONSTERS, INC."

14:01.611 --> 14:02.612
OOH.

14:02.612 --> 14:03.613
(computer alert chimes)

14:03.613 --> 14:04.915
OH.
(typing)

14:04.915 --> 14:07.447
UGH. E-MAIL FROM DENNIS.

14:07.447 --> 14:11.982
"HEY, BASKETS, DINNER SUCKED.
I POSTED THIS ONLINE."

14:11.982 --> 14:15.886
(dance music playing)

14:15.886 --> 14:18.488
I LOVE YOUR MEAT.
I LOVE YOUR MEAT.

14:18.488 --> 14:20.560
LOVE--LOVE--I LOVE YOUR MEAT.

14:20.560 --> 14:23.994
MEAT--MEAT--MEAT--
MEAT--MEAT--MEAT--I'M A DOUCHE.

14:23.994 --> 14:25.465
WHAT THE HELL IS THIS?

14:25.465 --> 14:26.596
I'VE NEVER PLEASED A WOMAN.

14:26.596 --> 14:28.899
NO! I-I WAS NEUTRALIZING HIM,

14:28.899 --> 14:31.601
I WAS DULLING HIS BLADE
LIKE GRANT TOLD ME TO.

14:31.601 --> 14:33.543
OH, IT'S GOOD MEAT, WILL.

14:33.543 --> 14:35.545
HERE, TRY A PIECE,
LET ME KNOW WHAT YOU THINK.

14:35.545 --> 14:37.507
MMM.

14:37.507 --> 14:39.609
THAT'S IT. THAT'S IT.
THIS IS WAR.

14:39.609 --> 14:42.052
HE HAS NO IDEA
WHO HE'S DEALING WITH.

14:42.052 --> 14:44.484
I'M A TINY LITTLE GIRL.
TINY--TINY--

14:44.484 --> 14:46.886
I'M A TINY LITTLE GIRL.
IT'S A LITTLE BASKET!

14:46.886 --> 14:50.921
TISKET--TASKET--BASKET!
TISKET--TASKET--BAS--

14:56.366 --> 14:59.369
(TV playing indistinctly)

15:01.201 --> 15:03.133
I FEEL WEIRD ABOUT THIS.

15:03.133 --> 15:04.334
WHAT? THE GUYS?
THEY'RE NOT WATCHING.

15:04.334 --> 15:07.437
I JUST FEEL LIKE WE SHOULD
TELL BRANDON THAT WE'RE DATING.

15:07.437 --> 15:09.139
NO, NO, IT'S FINE.

15:09.139 --> 15:10.210
IN FACT, LAST NIGHT,

15:10.210 --> 15:11.441
I WAS TUCKING
THAT LITTLE RASCAL INTO BED.

15:11.441 --> 15:14.514
HE SAYS TO ME, "DADDY,
I RECOGNIZE THAT YOU HAVE NEEDS.

15:14.514 --> 15:16.486
"YOU CAN DATE
WHOEVER YOU WANT.

15:16.486 --> 15:19.219
I JUST DON'T WANT
TO KNOW ABOUT IT."

15:19.219 --> 15:21.291
SHALL WE?

15:31.301 --> 15:33.363
THEN WE DID THIS,
THEN WE DID THIS,

15:33.363 --> 15:34.534
THEN WE ALMOST
GOT THE HIGH SCORE,

15:34.534 --> 15:36.366
BUT THEN WE DIDN'T.

15:36.366 --> 15:38.508
YOU MIGHT WANT TO RECONSIDER
CALLING THAT A STORY.

15:38.508 --> 15:41.211
WE ALSO ALL TOOK TURNS
SITTING IN HIS MASSAGE CHAIR.

15:41.211 --> 15:42.472
YOU WANT TO HEAR THAT STORY?

15:42.472 --> 15:44.314
I THINK I JUST DID.

15:44.314 --> 15:46.446
AW, THANKS FOR COMING
TO SUPPORT ME, GUYS.

15:46.446 --> 15:48.318
SO WHEN I TALK
ABOUT SCIENCE CLUB,

15:48.318 --> 15:50.220
I NEED EVERYBODY NODDING,

15:50.220 --> 15:52.382
AN OCCASIONAL WHOOP.
(men) WHOOP!

15:52.382 --> 15:53.523
OH! THAT WAS GOOD.

15:53.523 --> 15:56.326
THEN, BRENDA, YOU STAND UP
WHEN I TALK ABOUT

15:56.326 --> 15:58.558
HOW IT INFLUENCED YOU
TO BECOME A NURSE.

15:58.558 --> 16:00.260
SCIENCE CLUB?
(men) WHOOP!

16:00.260 --> 16:02.392
I HATED SCIENCE CLUB.
(men) WHOOP!

16:02.392 --> 16:03.533
I WAS SURROUNDED
BY NERD VIRGINS

16:03.533 --> 16:06.296
WHO'D RATHER TOUCH
A DEAD FROG THAN A LIVE GIRL.

16:06.296 --> 16:07.367
HAVE YOU GUYS
SEEN DENNIS YET?

16:07.367 --> 16:08.538
WILL, WILL, WILL.

16:08.538 --> 16:10.200
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

16:10.200 --> 16:12.342
I'VE HAD IT, THERESA.
YOU SAW THE REMIX.

16:12.342 --> 16:13.543
IT'S SOME STUPID VIDEO.

16:13.543 --> 16:17.447
LOOK, I KNOW THIS IS HARD,
BUT PLEASE, FOR ME,

16:17.447 --> 16:19.579
DON'T SAY ANYTHING
UNTIL AFTER THE MEETING.

16:19.579 --> 16:23.383
THIS IS BIGGER THAN ANY OF US.
IT'S SCIENCE CLUB.

16:23.383 --> 16:24.414
(men) WHOOP!

16:24.414 --> 16:26.416
(whispers) THANKS, GUYS.

16:26.416 --> 16:28.258
(amplified voice)
AND WHILE I KNOW MONEY'S TIGHT,

16:28.258 --> 16:30.390
KEEPING KIDS
EXCITED ABOUT SCIENCE

16:30.390 --> 16:33.293
IS ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT
THINGS A SCHOOL CAN DO.

16:33.293 --> 16:35.465
(murmuring)
(man) THAT'S RIGHT.

16:35.465 --> 16:38.228
(clears throat, amplified voice)
HI. I'M DENNIS MAYDER.

16:38.228 --> 16:39.599
I'D LIKE TO MAKE
A COUNTER-PROPOSAL.

16:39.599 --> 16:42.302
I BELIEVE THESE FUNDS
SHOULD GO TOWARD

16:42.302 --> 16:44.474
STOCKING THE CAFETERIA
WITH MORE MEAT.

16:44.474 --> 16:49.239
I HAPPEN TO KNOW THERE'S SOMEONE
HERE WHO REALLY LIKES MEAT.

16:49.239 --> 16:51.481
OKAY. GETTING BACK
TO THE TOPIC...

16:51.481 --> 16:53.513
I WOULD JUST LIKE
TO POINT OUT

16:53.513 --> 16:57.417
MY FRIEND BRENDA HAYDEN WAS
SO INFLUENCED BY SCIENCE CLUB...

16:57.417 --> 16:59.319
(both) WHOOP!
THAT SHE BECAME A NURSE.

16:59.319 --> 17:01.291
MM-HMM.
(under breath) I HEARD
SHE BECAME A NURSE

17:01.291 --> 17:03.453
FOR THE FREE ANTIBIOTICS.

17:03.453 --> 17:07.457
EVERY DAY AFTER SCHOOL YOU COULD
FIND BRENDA IN SCIENCE CLUB.

17:07.457 --> 17:11.261
(Kenny, Craig, and Grant) WHOOP!
YEAH, TRYING TO FIND A CURE
FOR CUSTODIAN HERPES. (laughs)

17:11.261 --> 17:12.602
(clears throat)

17:13.603 --> 17:15.465
I'M SORRY, SHARON.

17:15.465 --> 17:17.537
IF YOU HAVE SOMETHING TO SAY,
WHY DON'T YOU SAY IT OUT LOUD

17:17.537 --> 17:20.340
INSTEAD OF MUTTERING IT
LIKE AN OVERGROWN 15-YEAR-OLD?

17:20.340 --> 17:22.342
(all) OOH.

17:22.342 --> 17:25.345
(clears throat)
UH, I'D LIKE TO MAKE A MOTION

17:25.345 --> 17:26.616
THAT WILL KEEN
CONTROL HIS HUSBAND.

17:26.616 --> 17:29.419
(all) OOH.
LOOK, I DON'T MEAN TO BE RUDE.

17:29.419 --> 17:31.621
I'M JUST VERY PASSIONATE
ABOUT THE SCIENCE CLUB...

17:31.621 --> 17:33.423
WHOOP!
AND VERY FRUSTRATED.

17:33.423 --> 17:35.585
UH, YOU'VE GOT A PASSIONATE,
FRUSTRATED WOMAN THERE, WILL.

17:35.585 --> 17:38.528
THAT'S TELLING ME
YOU'RE NOT GETTING THE JOB DONE.

17:38.528 --> 17:39.629
(laughter)

17:39.629 --> 17:42.532
(normal voice, sighs)
SCREW THIS.

17:42.532 --> 17:45.295
YOU WANT TO GO
AFTER THAT GUY, DO IT.

17:45.295 --> 17:47.297
I'LL FIND A DIFFERENT WAY
TO FUND SCIENCE CLUB.

17:47.297 --> 17:48.598
(Kenny, Craig, and Grant) WHOOP!

17:48.598 --> 17:51.371
(amplified voice)
AND ANOTHER THING, SHARON--

17:51.371 --> 17:52.502
BRENDA DIDN'T MAKE OUT
WITH THAT JANITOR.

17:52.502 --> 17:55.405
THEY ACCIDENTALLY SHARED
A FRENCH LOVER.

17:55.405 --> 17:58.608
THAT'S HOW SHE GOT MOUTH HERPES.
(inhales and exhales sharply)

18:01.651 --> 18:04.514
(lowered voice) I'M SORRY I
DIDN'T DEFEND YOU 20 YEARS AGO.

18:04.514 --> 18:08.388
AND EVEN MORE SORRY HOW
I WORDED YOUR DEFENSE JUST NOW.

18:08.388 --> 18:12.422
THAT'S OKAY. ALL I EVER WANTED
WAS FOR YOU TO GO TO BAT FOR ME.

18:12.422 --> 18:14.664
NOW I'LL NEVER
WANT THAT AGAIN.

18:14.664 --> 18:17.327
(microphone feedback whines)
(amplified voice) I'D LIKE
TO GET THIS BACK ON TOPIC.

18:17.327 --> 18:20.470
IF WE DO FUND THE SCIENCE CLUB,
THE FIRST ORDER OF BUSINESS

18:20.470 --> 18:22.672
SHOULD BE BUYING
A MORE POWERFUL MICROSCOPE

18:22.672 --> 18:25.605
SO DENNIS MAYDER
CAN FINALLY FIND HIS WIENER.

18:25.605 --> 18:27.537
(jeers and laughter)

18:27.537 --> 18:29.409
WHOOP!
(banging table)

18:29.409 --> 18:31.411
I THINK WE SHOULD SPEND
MORE MONEY ON CHEERLEADING,

18:31.411 --> 18:33.513
AND WILL WOULD MAKE
A GREAT ANCHOR FOR THE PYRAMID

18:33.513 --> 18:35.415
BECAUSE OF HIS LADY HIPS.

18:35.415 --> 18:36.586
(laughter)

18:36.586 --> 18:39.389
I'M SURPRISED DENNIS DOESN'T
SUPPORT THE SCIENCE CLUB

18:39.389 --> 18:43.353
SO HE CAN BUILD A TIME MACHINE,
GO BACK TO 1991,

18:43.353 --> 18:44.554
AND NOT GET CAUGHT
SMACKING TAFFY

18:44.554 --> 18:46.426
AT RICHIE TIZZARD'S SLEEPOVER.

18:46.426 --> 18:47.727
(laughter)

18:47.727 --> 18:49.629
DUDE, WE WERE ALL AWAKE.

18:49.629 --> 18:51.431
SHUT UP, RICHIE!

18:51.431 --> 18:53.633
I'M SORRY, FOLKS, UH, DENNIS
IS A LITTLE FLUSTERED TONIGHT,

18:53.633 --> 18:54.734
JUST LIKE WHEN HE FUMBLED

18:54.734 --> 18:57.367
THE GAME-WINNING TOUCHDOWN
AGAINST GRANDVIEW.

18:57.367 --> 18:58.708
(crowd) OOH.

18:58.708 --> 19:00.570
(woman) HO HO HO.
OH, SNAP.

19:00.570 --> 19:02.572
I DIDN'T FUMBLE THAT.
MY KNEE WAS DOWN.

19:02.572 --> 19:05.545
YEAH, YOUR KNEE WAS DOWN A LOT
THAT SEASON, AS I REMEMBER.

19:05.545 --> 19:07.547
(crowd) OHH!

19:07.547 --> 19:10.450
THAT'S IT. YOU'RE DEAD.
RICHIE, GET THIS BABY OFF ME.

19:10.450 --> 19:11.481
COME ON. UNSNAP IT.

19:11.481 --> 19:13.383
THERE'S A PLASTIC "V"
RIGHT IN MY BACK.

19:13.383 --> 19:14.754
JUST UNHOOK IT RIGHT NOW.
COME ON. GET IT OFF ME.

19:14.754 --> 19:16.626
DUDE, THERE'S NO "V."

19:16.626 --> 19:17.727
YOU CAN DO IT, RICHIE.

19:17.727 --> 19:20.390
IT'S THE SAME WAY
YOU TAKE OFF HIS BRA.

19:20.390 --> 19:21.431
(laughter)

19:21.431 --> 19:22.732
WHOO!

19:22.732 --> 19:25.465
OKAY, THAT'S IT. I'M FIGHTING
HIM WITH THE BABY ON.

19:25.465 --> 19:26.596
LET'S GO!

19:26.596 --> 19:28.398
(man) WHOA, WHOA, WHOA.

19:28.398 --> 19:29.469
TAKE IT EASY, BUDDY.
AAH.

19:29.469 --> 19:31.501
COME ON. LET'S GO.

19:31.501 --> 19:32.702
(amplified voice)
AND I'D LIKE TO ADD

19:32.702 --> 19:35.575
THAT DENNIS' KID
IS A BUTT-MUNCH,

19:35.575 --> 19:36.606
AND HE SHOULD BE BREADED

19:36.606 --> 19:38.778
AND FRIED AND EATEN
BY CANNIBALS!

19:38.778 --> 19:40.750
(crowd gasps)
WHAT?!

19:40.750 --> 19:42.652
NOT THE BABY, THE OLDER ONE.

19:42.652 --> 19:44.454
(crowd) OHH.

19:44.454 --> 19:46.516
HA!
(applause)

19:46.516 --> 19:48.588
(laughs)

19:48.588 --> 19:50.420
HI, HONEY.

19:50.420 --> 19:51.491
HOW'D THE MEETING GO?

19:51.491 --> 19:53.563
GOOD. WE GOT THE FUNDING
FOR THE SCIENCE CLUB.

19:53.563 --> 19:55.495
AND YOU KNOW HOW WE TOLD YOU

19:55.495 --> 19:58.428
THAT WHEN DEALING WITH A BULLY,
THE HIGH ROAD IS THE GUY ROAD?

19:58.428 --> 20:00.500
WELL, THERE'S SOMETHING ELSE
YOU SHOULD KNOW.

20:00.500 --> 20:03.503
SOMETIMES YOU HAVE TO
PUBLICLY HUMILIATE HIM

20:03.503 --> 20:06.476
AND LEAVE HIM CRYING IN
HIS ESCALADE IN THE PARKING LOT.

20:07.577 --> 20:08.808
WHO WANTS CHAMPAGNE?

20:08.808 --> 20:11.481
NATHAN.
YOU EVER TASTE CHAMPAGNE?

20:11.481 --> 20:14.714
YOUR DAD'S A LITTLE EXCITED.
YOU'RE NOT HAVING CHAMPAGNE.

20:14.714 --> 20:16.646
YOU AND ME, KID!

20:19.949 --> 20:21.251
I CALLED YOU IN

20:21.251 --> 20:22.722
SO YOUR DAD AND I CAN TALK
TO YOU ABOUT SOMETHING--

20:22.722 --> 20:23.893
A GOOD THING.

20:23.893 --> 20:26.225
OH, HERE'S YOUR DAD NOW.
HEY, HONEY.

20:26.225 --> 20:27.226
HI.

20:27.226 --> 20:28.928
(kiss)
READY TO GO?

20:28.928 --> 20:31.931
HELLO. HOW ARE YOU?

20:31.931 --> 20:33.833
CRAIG,
I KNOW THIS IS A SURPRISE,

20:33.833 --> 20:35.004
BUT I REALLY FEEL

20:35.004 --> 20:38.768
WE OWE IT TO BRANDON
TO TELL HIM WE'RE DATING.

20:38.768 --> 20:41.271
(gasps) BRANDON. YES.

20:42.912 --> 20:44.243
I DON'T KNOW WHO
THIS GUY IS.

20:44.243 --> 20:47.717
BRANDON...
(exhales deeply) I...

20:47.717 --> 20:49.719
I KNOW WHAT YOU MEAN, SON.

20:49.719 --> 20:52.722
I, TOO, SOMETIMES FEEL LIKE
YOU AND I ARE STRANGERS,

20:52.722 --> 20:57.256
ONE OF WHOM IS TRYING
TO MAKE A NEW CONNECTION.

20:58.928 --> 20:59.989
HELP ME OUT, MAN.

20:59.989 --> 21:03.262
SERIOUSLY,
THIS GUY'S NOT MY DAD.

21:03.262 --> 21:06.936
OKAY. I THINK I CAN
CLEAR UP THE CONFUSION.

21:06.936 --> 21:08.898
I'VE BEEN LYING,

21:08.898 --> 21:12.742
SO I'M GOING TO
GIVE YOU MY WATCH,

21:12.742 --> 21:14.804
I'M GONNA TOUCH
THIS IGUANA,

21:14.804 --> 21:17.877
AND I'M GONNA
BE ON MY WAY.

21:19.008 --> 21:21.010
OOH! I WAS RIGHT--

21:21.010 --> 21:23.953
SLIPPERY, BUT NOT SLIMY.
