00:56.623 --> 00:58.466
You know,
I realize I haven't kept you

00:58.625 --> 01:01.435
up to speed...
on everything,

01:01.595 --> 01:04.132
but, uh, the situation
on the ground

01:04.298 --> 01:07.142
has, uh, changed, hasn't it?

01:07.301 --> 01:08.609
This is the part of the story

01:08.769 --> 01:12.239
where Dr. Frankenstein looks out
at the burning village

01:12.406 --> 01:14.147
and all the dead bodies

01:14.308 --> 01:17.050
and he thinks about his creation
and he says,

01:17.210 --> 01:21.090
"What-what the fuck
was I thinking?"

01:21.248 --> 01:24.320
How did those guys
save the world?

01:24.484 --> 01:26.486
Jesus Christ.

01:28.722 --> 01:32.295
It all started ten years ago,
the last mission.

01:36.296 --> 01:38.003
Say, we got that fix, Argon.

01:38.165 --> 01:40.270
It appears to be working now.
We're back at...

01:40.434 --> 01:41.874
guys off one by one.

01:41.935 --> 01:45.109
You got the, uh, huge force
that's moving, all armed.

01:45.272 --> 01:47.115
- We did see shots fired.
- Affirmed.

01:47.274 --> 01:49.345
- Roger that.
- Roger.

01:51.578 --> 01:53.854
Take cover!

01:55.515 --> 01:56.687
Look out for that bomb!

01:56.850 --> 01:58.090
All right, let's go!
Move! Move!

03:11.925 --> 03:14.405
Cover! Cover!
Cover! Cover! Cover!

03:14.561 --> 03:15.562
12:00 o'clock!
Watch 'em!

03:15.729 --> 03:16.833
Watch that left!

03:16.997 --> 03:18.601
The roof!

03:20.600 --> 03:22.443
Check the roof out!

03:23.770 --> 03:25.249
Incoming!
Incoming left!

03:25.405 --> 03:26.406
Incoming!

03:26.573 --> 03:27.950
Got a bird!
A bird!

03:30.911 --> 03:32.447
Take 'em out!
Take 'em out!

03:37.918 --> 03:40.262
Hold them here.
I'll go for the package.

03:40.420 --> 03:43.299
Remember, you still owe me ten Gs,
can't die yet.

03:43.457 --> 03:45.767
- See you on the side.
- Men, RPG!

03:45.926 --> 03:47.132
Move out!

03:47.294 --> 03:49.706
We've got a man down!
Man down!

04:25.799 --> 04:27.073
Wolfman.

04:28.902 --> 04:30.404
Go! Go! Go!

04:30.570 --> 04:32.072
Wolfman, you copy?

04:32.239 --> 04:33.549
Copy!
Meet you on the south side!

04:33.573 --> 04:35.348
I'm on my way.

04:36.910 --> 04:38.787
'Bout to have contact!

04:40.247 --> 04:42.693
Somebody's
moving from the south. Over.

04:49.456 --> 04:51.436
Motherfucker.

04:51.591 --> 04:53.696
That's Commander Motherfucker to you.

04:53.860 --> 04:56.500
Now, let's just find a way
I could let you two fools

04:56.663 --> 04:58.472
walk out of here
for old times' sake.

04:58.632 --> 05:00.202
What the fuck
are you doing here?

05:00.367 --> 05:02.369
I'm working.
What the fuck are you doing here?

05:02.536 --> 05:04.812
Saving the world, man?
When you gonna learn?

05:07.707 --> 05:10.119
Go on, tactical genius.
See how this plays out.

05:10.277 --> 05:12.621
Get out of here.
I got this.

05:12.779 --> 05:14.520
Wha...
Yeah, go ahead.

05:14.681 --> 05:16.126
Just... just run off, man.

05:16.283 --> 05:17.557
Bye.

05:19.386 --> 05:21.992
Oh, come on, man.

05:22.155 --> 05:23.800
You're not still on that old shit,
are you?

05:23.824 --> 05:25.132
I owe you one.

05:25.292 --> 05:28.569
Man, you need to let shit go
and grow the fuck up.

05:28.728 --> 05:29.872
I ain't got no time
for this shit.

05:29.896 --> 05:31.341
Oh, you gonna make time today.

05:31.498 --> 05:33.239
Just stop.

05:33.400 --> 05:35.346
Yeah.
Extraction's ready.

05:35.502 --> 05:37.641
Nah, just some checkers
showed up to a chess game.

05:37.804 --> 05:38.805
It'll be..

06:18.044 --> 06:20.046
Now, was that shit necessary?

06:24.451 --> 06:26.624
Enjoy your evening.

06:33.727 --> 06:35.798
He fuckin' played us.

06:51.478 --> 06:54.322
Nearly seven months has passed
since the last sighting

06:54.481 --> 06:56.483
of the infamous
self-made superhero

06:56.650 --> 06:58.152
known as The Vigilante.

06:58.318 --> 06:59.729
Made headlines last year

06:59.886 --> 07:02.765
when he allegedly killed
a rising Armenian syndicate.

07:04.891 --> 07:06.564
And with his disappearance,

07:06.726 --> 07:09.400
the city's crime rates
have risen by 40%.

07:09.562 --> 07:12.099
Michael Hanover's
web videos went viral

07:12.265 --> 07:15.906
after being the only person to capture
The Vigilante in action.

07:16.069 --> 07:18.982
The question is,
where is The Vigilante?

07:36.311 --> 07:48.956
(speaking Spanish)

07:58.645 --> 08:01.216

08:47.594 --> 08:50.268
Unfortunately,
that's no! it.

09:05.111 --> 09:07.057
Handsome.

09:08.681 --> 09:11.287
That'll make it fun.

09:11.451 --> 09:14.295
I hear they call you
The Vigilante.

09:14.454 --> 09:16.127
Is that correct?

09:17.190 --> 09:18.863
Is that correct?

09:19.025 --> 09:20.470
- Fuck you.
- Ah.

09:20.627 --> 09:23.699
You can take pain.
I like that.

09:25.131 --> 09:29.079
There's a very pissed off
Armenian boss who sent me.

09:30.136 --> 09:32.138
You killed his baby brother.

09:45.819 --> 09:48.299
And this is when he saw you,

09:48.455 --> 09:51.561
Mike Hanover, the filmmaker.

09:56.830 --> 10:00.073
And now he wants you
to suffer...

10:00.233 --> 10:02.110
badly.

10:02.268 --> 10:05.249
He will find Mike next.

10:05.405 --> 10:07.442
You had no idea you were at war

10:07.607 --> 10:10.611
with the Armenian mob, did you?

10:16.349 --> 10:20.695
When was the last time
you were touched like this, <i>hmm'?</i>

10:20.854 --> 10:22.856
Fuck you.

11:32.158 --> 11:34.764
Wait.

12:03.423 --> 12:04.925
Please!

12:05.091 --> 12:06.468
Please, I told you.

12:10.563 --> 12:13.908
I just party with Mike.
That's all.

12:14.067 --> 12:15.808
I don't know where he goes.

12:15.969 --> 12:18.040
I don't know what he does!

12:24.544 --> 12:26.319
I'll tell you what he does,

12:26.479 --> 12:29.119
this fucking joke.

12:29.282 --> 12:32.593
He puts videos on the Internet
making this man to be a hero.

12:33.987 --> 12:36.991
That fucking psycho
that killed my baby brother.

12:44.764 --> 12:48.678
But they said
The Vigilante's gone, right?

12:48.835 --> 12:50.906
That he's dead!

12:51.070 --> 12:54.176
That's not good enough.

12:54.340 --> 12:57.082
You know, they sell T-shirts
with his face on 'em,

12:57.243 --> 12:59.814
and I have to look
at that shit in the street.

13:01.247 --> 13:04.694
- Ah!
- Mike Hanover.

13:06.185 --> 13:07.687
Now, tell me where he is.

13:07.854 --> 13:10.027
I don't know.
I don't know.

13:10.189 --> 13:12.829
- I don't know. Please.
- Shh.

13:43.790 --> 13:46.293
You look like shit.

13:49.629 --> 13:51.870
Yeah, you do look like shit.

13:53.800 --> 13:55.541
Come on, bitch.
That's right, bitch.

14:00.640 --> 14:03.917
Motherfucker!
Die, motherfucker!

14:06.179 --> 14:07.817
Fucker.

14:21.494 --> 14:23.235
Fucker!

14:24.230 --> 14:26.369
Die! Die!

14:26.532 --> 14:28.569
Die already!

14:30.837 --> 14:32.612
Fucking dick!
Die, mother...

14:37.377 --> 14:39.721
Ew! Gross!
Gross, gross! Come on!

14:41.547 --> 14:43.067
Shit, man!
I don't know where you been!

14:43.216 --> 14:45.025
Just...

14:46.085 --> 14:48.292
Oh, God.

14:53.593 --> 14:56.233
That's me, Mike Hanover,
and I just killed a man

14:56.396 --> 14:58.376
in a taco shop bathroom.

14:59.465 --> 15:01.809
Hey, but he started it.

15:01.968 --> 15:04.312
I been hiding near the border
looking for The Vigilante,

15:04.470 --> 15:06.746
and hit men are on my ass.

15:06.906 --> 15:08.817
Wait.
ls that how I really run?

15:08.975 --> 15:11.751
Anyway, I had cars,
chicks, a badass crib,

15:11.911 --> 15:15.324
and now I got this
piece-of-shit ice cream truck,

15:15.481 --> 15:18.052
and we're on the run
from the Armenian mob.

15:18.217 --> 15:21.892
It all started seven months ago
with a documentary I was making.

15:26.159 --> 15:29.606
Okay, here's (he backstory,
so pay attention.

15:29.762 --> 15:32.242
That's The Vigilante,
the big dude.

15:32.398 --> 15:35.004
The big dude right there
mowing down bad guys and shit.

15:35.168 --> 15:38.081
You met him as a Special Forces
in the prologue.

15:38.237 --> 15:39.409
Not anymore.

15:39.572 --> 15:42.519
Now he is running the streets
and taking out fuckin' drug dealers,

15:42.675 --> 15:43.676
gangs, you name it.

15:43.843 --> 15:45.584
He has a sidekick, too.

15:45.745 --> 15:47.122
They call him The Kid.

15:47.280 --> 15:50.022
Look, I got to tag along
and document some missions,

15:50.183 --> 15:51.753
throw it up on the Web,

15:51.918 --> 15:54.330
and that's what made this guy
Internet famous.

15:55.354 --> 15:57.163
This last video
was at a heroin lab

15:57.323 --> 15:59.269
where they were using
little kids as drug mules.

15:59.425 --> 16:01.598
Can you believe that shit'?
It was fucked up.

16:01.761 --> 16:04.503
So Vigilante was capping dudes
left and right.

16:05.531 --> 16:08.171
Then he sent me and The Kid
to hang back

16:08.334 --> 16:10.541
at his safe house
while he cleaned up the mess,

16:10.703 --> 16:12.478
but this was
no ordinary safe house.

16:12.638 --> 16:15.551
Oh, no, It had chicks,
titties, and it had Jade,

16:15.708 --> 16:18.052
his numero uno lady.

16:18.211 --> 16:20.555
She was like the Alfred
to his Batcave,

16:20.713 --> 16:22.886
and they were this crazy,
badass couple.

16:23.049 --> 16:26.292
She ran shit, but I should
have been watching out for Red.

16:26.452 --> 16:28.692
That's right. This little hot chick
that worked for Jade.

16:28.721 --> 16:31.998
I was blinded by that ass.

16:32.158 --> 16:33.838
After that, we went back to
the heroin spot

16:33.893 --> 16:35.497
to pick up The Vigilante,

16:35.661 --> 16:37.902
but it was still crawling
with bad guys and shit,

16:38.064 --> 16:40.908
and he was after these guys
something fierce.

16:41.067 --> 16:44.173
The Armenian mob and him
had beef like a motherfucker,

16:44.337 --> 16:47.409
and shit was about
to hit the fan.

16:54.046 --> 16:56.492
Fuck.

16:59.352 --> 17:01.559
Shit.

17:05.258 --> 17:07.101
Don't move!

17:07.260 --> 17:09.205
- Get your hands up!
- Don't fuckin' move!

17:09.362 --> 17:10.897
Then it all made sense.

17:11.063 --> 17:13.339
They wanted him there
to get his ass out in the open.

17:13.499 --> 17:14.842
It was a setup.

17:15.001 --> 17:17.880
No one's seen or heard
from The Vigilante since.

17:18.037 --> 17:21.176
After all that that,
he was just gone, just like that.

17:21.339 --> 17:25.550
When The Kid and I came back to find
the safe-house girls dead, we knew it.

17:25.711 --> 17:26.951
We knew it was a setup.

17:27.113 --> 17:30.117
Oh, shit, it's Jade right here.

17:32.885 --> 17:34.193
This network secure?

17:34.353 --> 17:36.365
Look, they might be able
to hack into my porn,

17:36.389 --> 17:37.800
but other than that, we're good.

17:37.957 --> 17:39.630
- Good.
- You feeling okay?

17:39.792 --> 17:41.396
- I'm fine.
- Are you sure?

17:41.561 --> 17:43.721
- I said I'm fine.
- You don't look so hot, all right?

17:43.796 --> 17:46.800
I mean, you're still hot.
I'd bang the shit out of you...

17:46.966 --> 17:49.810
- Mike, shut up! Listen to me.
- Okay, what?

17:49.969 --> 17:52.449
Intel over
the Mexican cartel feeds

17:52.605 --> 17:55.051
have them holding an American captive
for the Armenian mob.

17:55.207 --> 17:57.312
- Could be him.
- Shit!

17:57.476 --> 17:59.888
Yeah.
No other reason why the Armenians

18:00.046 --> 18:01.557
and Mexicans
could be working together.

18:01.581 --> 18:04.061
The Kardashians could be
having a quinceañera.

18:05.484 --> 18:07.395
I know a guy that can help.

18:07.553 --> 18:09.965
- You know a guy?
- Yeah, I know a guy, all right?

18:10.122 --> 18:12.398
Gay Barry.
He got me out of a few jams in L.A.

18:12.558 --> 18:14.003
That's what he does.

18:14.160 --> 18:16.504
You know, he's just one of those
connected dudes.

18:16.662 --> 18:19.074
I didn't know if he was C.I.A.
or worked for the Apple Store,

18:19.231 --> 18:20.505
but he just knows shit.

18:20.666 --> 18:24.614
I guarantee he knows
some Call of Duty-type dudes.

18:24.770 --> 18:25.908
I'll send someone over now.

18:26.072 --> 18:27.642
- Who?
- Don't worry about it.

18:27.807 --> 18:30.485
- The less you know, the better.
- Okay, as long as the dude is cool,

18:30.509 --> 18:31.647
he'll be fine, all right?

18:31.811 --> 18:33.415
Barry's a little weird.

18:33.579 --> 18:36.150
- Weird?
- Eccentric.

18:59.205 --> 19:01.481
There's someone here for Barry!

19:03.042 --> 19:04.851
Barry!

19:06.545 --> 19:08.286
You interrupted my swim lesson.

19:09.715 --> 19:12.787
This is Jake.
He's my swim coach.

19:14.387 --> 19:16.162
Jake, go in the house.

19:16.322 --> 19:18.122
Wipe that oil off
before you sit on the couch.

19:18.224 --> 19:19.897
<i>Okay '</i>

19:20.893 --> 19:23.669
Bro, you know why the fuck I'm here.
You gonna help me or not?

19:23.829 --> 19:26.469
I would help you
if you'd learn some manners.

19:26.632 --> 19:28.210
You can't just walk around
like you're Baby Blade

19:28.234 --> 19:29.434
and break into people's homes.

19:29.502 --> 19:30.708
What's up with Generation Me?

19:30.870 --> 19:33.248
None of you guys
give a shit about anything.

19:33.406 --> 19:35.852
- You gonna help me or not?
- Okay, I'll help you.

19:36.008 --> 19:39.080
But first, Marta,

19:39.245 --> 19:40.849
get him
a sugar-free Red Bull.

19:41.013 --> 19:43.653
Oh, my...
Really?

19:47.553 --> 19:48.998
He's not here to fuck me.

19:50.656 --> 19:52.693
Half of what you said
is not in my Rosetta Stone.

19:54.827 --> 19:57.364
It's kind of...
It's almost like an arranged thing.

19:59.932 --> 20:01.377
Let's just go in the house.
Marta!

20:01.534 --> 20:04.014
I want my fucking burrito
after my meeting.

20:10.843 --> 20:12.914
So, Vigilante, huh?

20:13.079 --> 20:14.752
I like his work.

20:14.914 --> 20:17.690
Actually, when Mike called me,
I got a boner for it.

20:19.385 --> 20:21.695
Didn't say you'd be coming, though.

20:21.854 --> 20:23.527
Yeah, Jade likes
lo keep us separate.

20:23.689 --> 20:25.930
- Safer that way.
- Yeah, smart girl.

20:27.460 --> 20:28.530
So, how did it work?

20:28.694 --> 20:30.401
Were you in
the Big Brother program,

20:30.563 --> 20:32.874
and Vigilante just walks in and says,
<i>"I'll</i> take the black one"?

20:32.898 --> 20:35.708
- Fuck you.
- Touchy, are we?

20:35.868 --> 20:39.077
- What is all this'!
- Every tactical op in the state...

20:39.238 --> 20:42.151
F.B.I., C.I.A., A.T.F.,

20:42.308 --> 20:44.508
some-even some chatter
from local terrorist cells, too.

20:44.643 --> 20:46.645
I just monitor it,
look for patterns.

20:46.812 --> 20:48.985
For what?

20:49.148 --> 20:51.992
Hey, just because I don't get up
at dawn anymore and do pushups

20:52.151 --> 20:53.892
doesn't mean
I don't love my country.

20:54.053 --> 20:57.000
- You ever heard of SEAL Team Six'?
- You were a SEAL?

20:57.156 --> 20:58.658
Yeah, I was a SEAL.

20:58.824 --> 21:01.668
"Don't ask, don't tell,"
it's fucking bullshit.

21:01.827 --> 21:05.400
Besides, I'm still doing my part
to keep assholes like you safe.

21:05.564 --> 21:07.009
Oh, here it is.

21:07.166 --> 21:09.510
Okay, now the last thing
we got from Mike

21:09.668 --> 21:13.844
has your boy right here
just south of the border in Mexico.

21:14.006 --> 21:15.679
I know the perfect guys for this.

21:15.841 --> 21:18.845
Ex-Blackwater studs,
bored and badass.

21:19.011 --> 21:21.582
- They'll do this.
- How you know they'll do it'?

21:21.747 --> 21:24.250
Trust me.
They'll do it.

21:24.416 --> 21:25.986
- Marta!
- What?

21:26.152 --> 21:28.462
- Get the car!
- Oh, no, no, no.

21:33.592 --> 21:36.300
I can't get a divorce.
It's part of my cover.

21:46.438 --> 21:49.351

- Hey, think someone's here for you.
- Hey, what's up?

22:07.993 --> 22:10.496
Gay Barry!

22:10.663 --> 22:12.870
- Wolfman.
- Gay Barry, man!

22:13.032 --> 22:15.569
- What the fuck, man?
- We gotta talk.

22:15.734 --> 22:18.738
I got us a gig.
It's big.

22:18.904 --> 22:20.975
Let's do this, man.
Let's talk.

22:21.140 --> 22:23.416
It's huge, like 12 inches.

22:23.576 --> 22:25.886
Come on, man.

22:26.045 --> 22:27.365
Let's go talk, man.
You need to...

22:27.413 --> 22:30.360
- You look good. You been training?
- Don't touch me, man.

22:30.516 --> 22:32.723
- Mexico?
- Just the border.

22:32.885 --> 22:34.421
- You have positive l.D.?
- Enough.

22:34.587 --> 22:36.692
And you can trust the intel?

22:37.756 --> 22:39.201
Who's paying?

22:39.358 --> 22:41.201
Rich white kid from the B.H.

22:41.360 --> 22:42.520
He's got the money, trust me.

22:42.661 --> 22:45.767
He'll meet you guys in Tecate,
blitz extraction.

22:45.931 --> 22:48.331
You'll be back in the U.S.
before you know it. It's all good.

22:49.034 --> 22:52.345
- What's going on here?
- Time to go back to work.

22:54.340 --> 22:57.878
Chillax, he's with me.
Gentlemen, meet Kid.

22:58.043 --> 23:00.956
Is you going black now, Barry?

23:01.113 --> 23:03.616
- Once you go black, man...
- Hey, fuck you, man.

23:03.782 --> 23:05.625
Now, chill out,
little toy soldier.

23:05.784 --> 23:07.695
A little badass, this one, huh?

23:07.853 --> 23:09.423
This little badass

23:09.588 --> 23:13.400
- is Vigilante's sidekick.
- Don't call me his fucking sidekick.

23:13.559 --> 23:17.632
Look, Barry says you all
are who we need to get this done.

23:17.796 --> 23:19.469
The Vigilante's being held
at the border

23:19.632 --> 23:21.475
by the cartels,
and I need some more guns.

23:21.634 --> 23:23.875
- Simple as that.
- What do you think, Geek?

23:24.036 --> 23:26.380
If the intel's solid, I'm game.

23:26.538 --> 23:27.915
I like paydays.-

23:28.073 --> 23:30.644
It's true. Mexicans like paydays.

23:30.809 --> 23:32.914
Oh, come on.
Mucho dinero, right'?

23:33.078 --> 23:34.386
Oh, come on.
I'm just kidding.

23:34.546 --> 23:36.787
So, what's up?
Can we do this or what?

23:37.816 --> 23:40.160
There's only one thing
I like doing more than chicks.

23:41.420 --> 23:43.491
It's making money.

24:27.166 --> 24:29.544
Up!

24:29.702 --> 24:32.376
Everyone!

24:56.528 --> 24:58.565
What the fuck are you doing?

25:09.908 --> 25:13.515
- What the fuck are you...
- Hey.

25:13.679 --> 25:15.158
He was our brother.

25:15.314 --> 25:18.488
You're ignoring your business,
my business.

25:18.650 --> 25:20.994
You need to end this.

25:21.153 --> 25:23.929
Just kill that motherfucker
and get it on with.

25:25.324 --> 25:28.533
But we're not done yet.

25:28.694 --> 25:32.107
I want the man who made
The Vigilante a hero.

25:32.264 --> 25:34.266
You bring us down.

25:40.239 --> 25:42.014
But I run this family.

26:14.573 --> 26:16.883
Take the shot.

26:23.082 --> 26:24.720
Two males.

26:24.883 --> 26:27.762
- Cannot confirm l.D.
- Green on both.

26:34.460 --> 26:37.930
I-I have names,
contacts.

26:38.097 --> 26:40.008
I can help you.

26:51.310 --> 26:53.813
What the fuck?
He was still alive.

26:53.979 --> 26:57.426
That's your fault.
You hesitated on your trigger pull.

26:59.451 --> 27:01.522
We could have got names
out of him.

27:01.687 --> 27:04.497
He was the name.

27:12.865 --> 27:15.539
What are you doing?
They're gonna be coming any minute.

27:15.701 --> 27:18.648
- Ain't nobody coming in here.
- What are you talking about?

27:18.804 --> 27:21.284
You were gonna pull on me there,
weren't you'?

27:21.440 --> 27:23.716
I saw it in your eyes.

27:23.876 --> 27:25.947
Yeah.

27:28.547 --> 27:31.050
Your training's far from over, son.
Let's face it.

27:35.020 --> 27:37.466
I'm fuckin' hungry.

27:37.623 --> 27:39.625
Let's go get some breakfast.

27:45.664 --> 27:49.237
If he's too good at what he does,

27:49.401 --> 27:51.347
it can come back lo haunt you.

27:51.503 --> 27:54.074
Man's gotta be careful nowadays.

27:56.074 --> 27:58.748
If he's too good
at what he does,

27:58.911 --> 28:01.255
it can come back lo haunt you.

28:05.417 --> 28:07.829
Whole world's in an upheaval.

28:11.023 --> 28:13.503
Sometimes when you're needed,

28:13.659 --> 28:16.606
you gotta take care of business.

28:19.331 --> 28:22.835
Your identity's gonna be erased
from all the databases,

28:23.001 --> 28:24.742
foreign and domestic.

28:24.903 --> 28:27.782
It'll be like you
were never even born,

28:27.940 --> 28:29.942
like you never existed.

28:32.611 --> 28:34.682
You understand your commitment?

28:37.449 --> 28:40.259
And there is no discharge
from this service, son.

28:40.419 --> 28:42.865
You're never gonna live
a normal life again.

28:43.855 --> 28:45.960
You're a stone-cold killer...

28:47.593 --> 28:49.971
plain and simple.

28:50.128 --> 28:53.302
No family, no next of kin.

28:53.465 --> 28:56.309
Ecerybody's gonna want you.

28:56.468 --> 28:59.745
C.I.A., Rangers,

28:59.905 --> 29:02.317
SEALS...

29:02.474 --> 29:04.147
this ain't like that at all.

29:04.309 --> 29:07.984
Those fellas
get to go home at night,

29:08.146 --> 29:10.148
see their families,
kiss their wives,

29:10.315 --> 29:12.124
and play with their kids,

29:12.284 --> 29:14.230
build that little white fence
around the house,

29:14.386 --> 29:17.731
and, you know, sing hallelujah.

29:19.992 --> 29:22.233
Your country needs you,

29:22.394 --> 29:24.635
plain and simple.

29:27.833 --> 29:30.677
- You follow?
- I do.

29:31.837 --> 29:34.443
All right.
Good luck.

29:48.854 --> 29:51.596
Time to wake up, handsome.

29:54.426 --> 29:56.167
You'll like this.

30:13.779 --> 30:16.885
That smells good.

30:17.049 --> 30:18.722
What happened to you?

30:18.884 --> 30:21.990
What happened to the tough guy

30:22.154 --> 30:26.068
that's always in the news, hmm?

30:31.229 --> 30:33.903
You are a fucking nobody.

30:34.066 --> 30:37.070
You couldn't cut it with
the military or the feds.

30:38.403 --> 30:41.646
Look who it is.

30:42.841 --> 30:45.481
Can that piece of shit hear me?

30:45.644 --> 30:46.918
Yes.

30:47.079 --> 30:50.686
Hey, Mr. Vigilante,
or whatever the fuck your real name is.

30:52.851 --> 30:55.593
You're a trophy now,

30:55.754 --> 30:57.324
not a person.

30:57.489 --> 30:59.662
I want to know something.

31:01.259 --> 31:02.761
Was it worth it?

31:02.928 --> 31:04.999
No.

31:06.431 --> 31:09.275
Except for that stupid look
on your brother's face

31:09.434 --> 31:11.436
when I put a bullet in it.

31:15.774 --> 31:18.778
Please send me videos.

31:18.944 --> 31:21.185
Will do.

31:23.949 --> 31:26.896
This is going to be fun.

32:40.292 --> 32:43.432
I guess it's not your time.

32:46.131 --> 32:48.133
Mmm.

32:54.706 --> 32:56.652
That's how we say good-bye
in London.

33:07.819 --> 33:09.730
Spread out! Find him!

33:09.888 --> 33:12.494
I'll take the back!
Barry! Cover Geek!

33:41.186 --> 33:43.223
Whew.

34:00.272 --> 34:01.910
You got this.

34:03.842 --> 34:07.119
You motherfuckers!
This is Gucci!

34:24.295 --> 34:26.708
Shit, you the motherfucker
we been looking for.

34:26.864 --> 34:29.072
You still owe me ten Gs.
You remember that?

34:29.234 --> 34:31.271
Now's not the time.

34:34.806 --> 34:36.978
We have to go now.

34:45.650 --> 34:48.597
- You good?
- All good.

34:57.429 --> 34:59.841
I believe this is yours.

35:02.434 --> 35:04.505
I thought it'd be bigger.

35:28.593 --> 35:31.199
Yeah! Holy shit!
Aw, fuck!

35:31.363 --> 35:33.036
Yes!

35:34.366 --> 35:37.870
Shit, Jade, they fuckin' did it!
They got him!

35:38.036 --> 35:39.538
We got him!
He's okay!

35:39.704 --> 35:41.149
- They did it!
- Copy that.

35:41.306 --> 35:43.013
Man, you should...
It was insane!

35:43.174 --> 35:45.211
You should have seen this shit,
the action.

35:45.377 --> 35:47.220
There was RPGs
and there was land mines

35:47.379 --> 35:49.723
and fuckin' night vision
and fuckin' machine...

35:53.018 --> 35:54.793
I even saw fuckin' kuh-tai-sin!

35:54.953 --> 35:58.662
Kuh-to-sin!
It was fucking awesome!

35:58.823 --> 36:02.236
- Mike, shut up.
- Oh, my God, wait! The Kid!

36:02.394 --> 36:04.635
- The Kid was with them!
- I know. I know.

36:04.796 --> 36:08.642
- Wait. What? You know?
- Of course. I've always known.

36:08.800 --> 36:10.336
What did I say?

36:10.502 --> 36:13.415
Safer to keep us separate.

36:14.572 --> 36:17.212
Anyway, now that he's back,
it'll all be okay now.

36:17.375 --> 36:18.410
Things will be different

36:18.576 --> 36:21.250
and we can move... move on.

36:21.413 --> 36:23.586
Jade! Jade!

36:23.748 --> 36:25.819
The hell?

36:27.085 --> 36:30.259
Holy shit. Red!

36:30.422 --> 36:32.733
- Get out of the ice cream truck.
- I thought you were dead.

36:32.757 --> 36:35.431
Shut up. Now.

36:35.593 --> 36:37.436
What are you doing?

36:38.697 --> 36:40.938
- What are you doing?
- You really are an idiot.

36:41.099 --> 36:43.375
Why would you go to the...

36:55.580 --> 36:57.700
He's not gonna talk.

37:22.874 --> 37:24.217
I have the package.

37:24.375 --> 37:26.321
Enough with the military lingo.

37:26.478 --> 37:28.651
I'm a civilian now.
I'm tired of hearing that shit.

37:28.813 --> 37:30.486
Now, you kidnapped
the rich kid, right?

37:30.648 --> 37:32.457
Now don't say affirmative.
Say yes.

37:32.617 --> 37:35.223
Yes.
I'm bringing him to you.

37:35.386 --> 37:36.490
Nah, fuck, no.

37:36.654 --> 37:38.574
Your boyfriend,
the dude that looks like Dracula,

37:38.656 --> 37:40.067
he still wants revenge, right?

37:40.225 --> 37:42.136
So bring the rich kid to him.
Let him have some fun.

37:42.160 --> 37:43.600
The Vigilante's
still on the streets.

37:43.728 --> 37:46.299
Good. That fucking gorilla
draws so much attention.

37:46.464 --> 37:47.975
Let the cops and the feds
hunt his ass.

37:47.999 --> 37:49.342
We can get to him.

37:49.501 --> 37:51.503
No, no, no, no.
I have plans for him.

37:51.669 --> 37:54.343
- Now, is that it?
- Yeah.

37:54.506 --> 37:56.645
Enjoy your evening.

38:04.082 --> 38:05.755
About that uranium...

38:05.917 --> 38:08.591
I don't...
I don't know anything.

38:08.753 --> 38:10.630
- I don't know.
- You heard him!

38:10.789 --> 38:12.598
Where is it?

38:12.757 --> 38:14.757
Tell him. Tell him!

38:26.838 --> 38:28.476
You made a commitment.

38:28.640 --> 38:30.711
I didn't beg you for that.

38:39.717 --> 38:42.630
Calm down.
Calm down. Calm down.

38:42.787 --> 38:44.562
You should get that
looked at, you know.

38:44.722 --> 38:47.066
Soon, yeah.

38:47.225 --> 38:48.795
What the fuck
happened over there?

38:49.828 --> 38:51.748
- Nothing you need to know about.
- It's my life.

38:51.796 --> 38:53.207
I'd like to know
what the fuck is going on.

38:53.231 --> 38:55.711
Your life?

38:55.867 --> 38:57.676
It's not your life anymore.

38:57.836 --> 38:59.247
You gave that to me.

38:59.404 --> 39:01.907
That belongs to me now.

39:02.073 --> 39:04.383
You made a commitment.
I didn't beg you for that.

39:04.542 --> 39:06.681
You don't remember, do you?

39:06.845 --> 39:08.381
That was different.

39:08.546 --> 39:09.923
It was for my country.

39:10.081 --> 39:12.254
Now it's for the world.

39:12.417 --> 39:14.488
All you gotta remember
is infiltrate,

39:14.652 --> 39:17.326
pull the trigger,
and get the fuck out.

39:17.488 --> 39:19.900
Outside of that,
there's nothing more to talk about.

39:20.058 --> 39:21.765
And if we've reached an impasse,

39:21.926 --> 39:24.702
there's gonna be a conclusion
that you're not gonna like one bit.

39:26.431 --> 39:27.774
I should've seen this coming.

39:27.932 --> 39:30.276
I saw your psyche tests,
you know.

39:31.736 --> 39:34.546
Propensity for rebellion
and challenge of authority

39:34.706 --> 39:37.619
and, uh, borderline bipolar
and all that, you know.

39:37.775 --> 39:40.056
Look, I don't need to hear
that fuckin' shit now. Come on.

39:40.111 --> 39:42.421
It's been a short time, okay?
Get used to it.

39:42.580 --> 39:43.957
You haven't been around that long.

39:44.115 --> 39:47.062
I don't wanna, you know,
put down your worldview,

39:47.218 --> 39:51.792
but, uh, it's never been
about, uh, good versus the bad.

39:51.956 --> 39:54.095
It's about keeping
the powerful in power.

39:55.627 --> 39:58.699
There's no out for you.
There's no out for me.

39:58.863 --> 40:01.275
There's only the next mission.

40:46.911 --> 40:48.618
This is what you did
with that Arab cash.

40:48.780 --> 40:51.624
We be diversifying, man.
I be flipping cars.

40:51.783 --> 40:53.922
Tex be making tamales
and selling them.

40:54.085 --> 40:56.998
And dude right here, man,
he opened up a gym.

40:57.155 --> 40:59.294
What's the name of your gym?
XPC? DFG?

40:59.457 --> 41:01.334
- EPX.
- We got a problem.

41:03.461 --> 41:05.031
I just got this.

41:06.698 --> 41:08.439
What the fuck?

41:08.599 --> 41:09.976
How'd they get him?

41:10.134 --> 41:12.413
Mike had to open up to communicate
with us about the feed.

41:12.437 --> 41:14.610
They were watching.
They found him.

41:14.772 --> 41:16.547
- Jesus.
- Who's they?

41:16.708 --> 41:19.450
The entire Armenian mob.

41:19.610 --> 41:21.112
They don't like me.

41:21.279 --> 41:23.987
Nobody likes you.
Those dudes don't play.

41:24.148 --> 41:27.721
Half of 'em ex-military.
Your boy's dead.

41:27.885 --> 41:30.991
Wolfman, the fucking white guy,

41:31.155 --> 41:33.157
The Armenians, all that shit,

41:33.324 --> 41:35.133
ain't none
of our fuckin' business.

41:35.293 --> 41:37.295
We did our job.

41:37.462 --> 41:39.908
Here we are,

41:40.064 --> 41:41.907
and there he is safe and sound.

41:42.066 --> 41:44.012
Just show me the fuckin' money.

41:44.168 --> 41:46.409
There is no money
if he fuckin' dies!

41:46.571 --> 41:48.847
This fuckin' white guy
is the one who's paying.

41:49.007 --> 41:51.317
I suggest you start planning
a rescue operation.

41:51.476 --> 41:54.013
- From the Armenian mob?
- Yeah.

41:54.178 --> 41:55.486
That's not a rescue.
That's war.

41:55.646 --> 41:58.490
Look, I'll take a rain check

41:58.649 --> 42:00.492
for saving your ass,

42:00.651 --> 42:03.723
but this rich douche bag
who own daddy won't pay to save him...

42:04.922 --> 42:07.368
that ain't on us, man,
that's... that's your shit.

42:07.525 --> 42:10.995
It is on me.
Just me.

42:12.930 --> 42:15.604
I need wheels.

42:15.767 --> 42:17.440
Got you.

42:20.104 --> 42:21.777
Gear's in the back.

42:25.610 --> 42:28.853
- You know where Mike Hanover is.
- Of course I know where he's at.

42:29.013 --> 42:31.289
Planted a tracker on that dumb-ass
the day I met him.

42:31.449 --> 42:34.396
The only person I trust is that
big motherfucker over there.

42:46.130 --> 42:48.132
So, what's up?
We getting paid?

42:48.299 --> 42:51.576
The dude still owe me ten Gs.

42:51.736 --> 42:53.647
Nobody get paid around him.

43:05.149 --> 43:07.993
What is that?
It's close.

43:08.152 --> 43:11.099
There's his ass right there,
that black BMW.

43:11.255 --> 43:14.327
All right, give him space.

43:31.742 --> 43:34.746
- He's going in that garage.
- I got him.

44:04.675 --> 44:06.211
Hang back.

44:06.377 --> 44:08.379
What the fuck is this?

44:12.383 --> 44:14.192
It's a setup!
Go! Move!

45:26.757 --> 45:28.532
Stop... stop moving.

46:05.162 --> 46:07.472
You're dead.

46:07.632 --> 46:09.339
I'll kill you.

47:00.551 --> 47:02.622
<i>♪ Ohh ♪</i>

47:03.621 --> 47:05.658

47:06.791 --> 47:08.793

47:15.733 --> 47:17.735
Whoa.

47:17.902 --> 47:19.677
Hello!

47:19.837 --> 47:21.839
Someone wants to say hello.

47:22.006 --> 47:23.576
Oh, Dad, come on!

47:23.741 --> 47:25.311
Can you two please stop?

47:25.476 --> 47:27.183
Stop what?

47:27.345 --> 47:29.325
Stop this?

47:29.480 --> 47:30.481
Oh...

47:30.648 --> 47:33.322
Look, tell your boss
I have what he wants.

47:33.484 --> 47:34.929
Dad, look, don't pay.

47:35.086 --> 47:38.590
You know how much I used to pay to get
tied up and get this kind of treatment?

47:38.756 --> 47:41.930
Jesus fucking Christ.
Can you believe this kid?

47:42.093 --> 47:45.267
No, no, no, listen.
Have you seen the ass on this one'?

47:45.429 --> 47:46.931
Right?
She's hot, and she's Asian!

47:47.098 --> 47:48.668
Michael, will you shut up?

47:48.833 --> 47:50.608
Shut the fuck up!

47:50.768 --> 47:54.614
Look, tell that fuckin' Armenian I got
his money, and I'm sending it now.

47:54.772 --> 47:57.446
This idiot's really your son?

47:57.608 --> 48:00.589
Yes, that idiot
is really my son.

48:08.285 --> 48:10.356
Raven...

48:12.123 --> 48:14.034
make our guest feel at home.

48:19.964 --> 48:23.878
So, anyway, r-really,
though, what's your name?

48:25.903 --> 48:29.146
Listen, whatever my dad's paying you,
I'll pay you double.

48:29.306 --> 48:32.810
Now all I... all I want to do
is just have a little fun here.

48:32.977 --> 48:34.650
This is going to be fun.

48:34.812 --> 48:36.223
It will be fun.

48:36.380 --> 48:37.552
Is that what you're saying?

48:37.715 --> 48:39.490
- You're agreeing to my terms?
- Oh, yes.

48:39.650 --> 48:42.130
Yeah, I have a camera we can use.
A little video?

48:42.286 --> 48:45.893
What shall I do to you next,
you naughty boy?

48:46.056 --> 48:49.128
- Sit on my face?
- Oh.

49:41.846 --> 49:43.553
We ain't gonna let you
go by yourself, man.

49:46.217 --> 49:48.219
You're still easy to track.

49:49.320 --> 49:50.856
This one's not gonna be pretty.

49:52.323 --> 49:55.133
It never is.

50:22.486 --> 50:24.227
Hello, ladies.
Come on in.

50:24.388 --> 50:27.096
Right in here.
See me later, okay?

50:27.258 --> 50:28.931
Ugh.
Look at these idiots.

50:29.093 --> 50:31.004
Halloween's next month.
Come back then.

50:31.161 --> 50:33.163
Hey!

51:23.213 --> 51:26.217
- How we doing?
- Fine.

51:32.089 --> 51:34.000
I'll be right back.

52:06.423 --> 52:08.869
You like that, don't you,
you little shit?

52:09.026 --> 52:11.870
All right!
Look, that's my boys coming, all right?

52:12.029 --> 52:14.839
So why don't you just untie me
and just run?

52:14.999 --> 52:16.444
But first, give me your email.

52:16.600 --> 52:19.012
Hey!

52:42.292 --> 52:44.568
You fucking idiot.

52:54.304 --> 52:58.081
- Where are we going?
- To the sky, baby.

53:05.416 --> 53:08.420
Hey, what you always
doing on the floor?

53:08.585 --> 53:10.258
Fucking piece of shit got away.

53:10.421 --> 53:12.025
Let's go get your boy.

53:12.189 --> 53:14.226
I'll call for a pick up.

53:17.828 --> 53:20.069
- Just look, man.
- Shit.

53:22.866 --> 53:24.539
All right, look, look, hold up!

53:24.702 --> 53:26.413
- Why don't we ju...
- Give me that, you little shi...

53:26.437 --> 53:28.508
Wait! Ohh!

53:28.672 --> 53:30.618
Pull this out. Let me pull it out.

53:30.774 --> 53:34.017
I'm sorry. How is it?

53:34.178 --> 53:36.283
Is that better? Give...

53:37.448 --> 53:40.224
Ah, shit!
Not again!

53:40.384 --> 53:43.627
- What the fuck are you doing?
- What up, bro'?!

53:43.787 --> 53:46.791
Wha...
This isn't what it looks like, bro.

53:46.957 --> 53:48.757
It's not at all
what it looks like, all right?

53:48.792 --> 53:50.465
Like, dude,
I knew you would come!

53:50.627 --> 53:53.107
Dude, man, it is so good
to see you, bro.

53:53.263 --> 53:55.503
- What the fuck's going on here, man?
- Another sidekick?

53:55.632 --> 53:57.236
Dude, he's my sidekick.

53:57.401 --> 53:59.472
- Fair enough. Hey!
- No, no. We good.

53:59.636 --> 54:01.214
- We gotta go, man. We gotta go.
- Let's go.

54:01.238 --> 54:03.479
That's awesome, dude.
You got a "V" on you!

54:03.640 --> 54:06.382
Symbol and shit.
That's dope.

54:13.083 --> 54:14.926
Give me the guns,
you freakin' lunatics!

54:15.085 --> 54:16.621
You can't have these
in the streets!

54:21.492 --> 54:23.036
- I'll get you next time.
- All right, man.

54:23.060 --> 54:25.904
- Next time, right.
- Hey, dude. Get back, man.

54:27.931 --> 54:30.673
Mike! Can you see me?

54:30.834 --> 54:31.938
Yeah.

54:32.102 --> 54:35.174
If it wasn't for that
goddamn documentary...

54:35.339 --> 54:37.285
Look, kid, just come home.

54:37.441 --> 54:40.285
Home home?

54:40.444 --> 54:42.481
You need anything?

54:45.082 --> 54:47.084
I think I'll be all right.

54:57.194 --> 54:59.538
- Yeah.
- Hot on patrol?

54:59.696 --> 55:02.370
Every fuckin' day.
What do you want, Moreau?

55:02.533 --> 55:05.343
Think of this
as a common courtesy call

55:05.502 --> 55:07.209
to a former protégé, that's all.

55:07.371 --> 55:08.873
I'm hanging up-

55:09.039 --> 55:13.545
You know, I told you a long time ago,
it's not about right or wrong, okay?

55:13.710 --> 55:17.021
L... I think, you know,
you decided somewhere along the way

55:17.181 --> 55:21.220
to use your infinite powers
to start a war, to go solo.

55:21.385 --> 55:24.298
You wanted a war,
well, now you got one, don't you'?

55:25.389 --> 55:28.302
But you went too far,
went too public,

55:28.458 --> 55:31.405
went after the guys
who are paying the bills.

55:31.562 --> 55:33.803
What's gonna happen then?
They're gonna call me, right?

55:33.964 --> 55:35.910
Good.
I'll be looking out for you.

55:36.066 --> 55:37.977
Yeah, that's nice, but, uh,

55:38.135 --> 55:40.213
you got a lot more to worry about
than that, you know,

55:40.237 --> 55:42.740
- family and all.
- Family?

55:42.906 --> 55:45.011
What the fuck are you talking about?

55:45.175 --> 55:50.716
Oh, the infamous Vigilante
gone soft.

55:50.881 --> 55:53.157
Is that it?

56:19.376 --> 56:22.289
You said you're comin' after me'!
Don't bother.

56:22.446 --> 56:23.618
I'm on my way.

56:24.948 --> 56:27.019
I'll be right here waiting.

56:37.461 --> 56:40.908
I think you still have
a soft spot for that maniac.

56:41.064 --> 56:44.136
That's a very dangerous man,
and you just took his fuckin' wife.

56:44.301 --> 56:46.440
No, we just took his fuckin' wife.

56:47.771 --> 56:50.217
I'm gonna disappear
for a while, 'kay?

56:50.374 --> 56:51.478
And so should you.

56:51.642 --> 56:54.646
Man, I'm a businessman.
I got work to do.

56:54.811 --> 56:57.417
Besides, I'm not worried
about your boy right now.

56:57.581 --> 57:00.960
I'll keep his attention
far away from me for a while,

57:01.118 --> 57:03.064
send his ass to Armenia.

57:04.588 --> 57:07.899
Let's remove Mr. Moreau
from my contact list.

57:08.058 --> 57:10.299
- Copy that.
- Make a left over here.

57:57.541 --> 57:59.714
You know,
agents will flip-flop,

57:59.876 --> 58:02.857
and ops will go sideways.

58:03.013 --> 58:06.392
Best laid plans can turn into
a gigantic clusterfuck.

58:09.052 --> 58:11.157
It happens.

58:11.321 --> 58:13.358
So I had to improvise

58:13.523 --> 58:16.800
and, um, rein things in...

58:18.528 --> 58:22.203
without declaring
our asset a total loss.

58:23.900 --> 58:27.404
I tried everything
I could think of to...

58:27.571 --> 58:29.573
get him on a leash and...

58:30.707 --> 58:33.517
But he's feral, Christ.

58:33.677 --> 58:36.089
That's another word
for a stray animal.

58:38.215 --> 58:41.025
Or a rogue or a ronin or...

58:41.184 --> 58:44.222
Whatever the fuck you wanna call him,

58:44.388 --> 58:46.425
but, uh...

58:47.591 --> 58:50.003
you know,
I trained him right, and, uh...

58:52.062 --> 58:54.372
once he's dead set...

58:56.666 --> 58:58.907
there ain't no stopping him.

59:00.537 --> 59:03.177
And that is a fuckin' fact.

01:00:37.834 --> 01:00:39.279
I need information.

01:00:41.771 --> 01:00:43.512
All right.

01:00:45.208 --> 01:00:46.209
You're not gonna drink?

01:00:49.479 --> 01:00:50.719
You gonna help me or not?

01:00:54.317 --> 01:00:56.888
<i>Okay.</i>

01:01:01.525 --> 01:01:03.129
Let's go.

01:01:12.068 --> 01:01:13.411
Good.

01:01:15.238 --> 01:01:16.678
I've been trying
to forget that shit.

01:02:32.115 --> 01:02:35.324
You sent your dogs
all the way out here

01:02:35.485 --> 01:02:39.558
to my home to fuck with me?

01:02:39.723 --> 01:02:43.000
- When is this game over'!
- When I'm done playing.

01:02:43.159 --> 01:02:45.765
I am done playing.

01:02:45.929 --> 01:02:48.671
The chess pieces
don't get to decide

01:02:48.832 --> 01:02:50.971
when the game is over,
now, do they? No.

01:02:51.134 --> 01:02:52.477
Somebody has
to think it through,

01:02:52.636 --> 01:02:55.014
be three moves ahead
before he moves one piece,

01:02:55.171 --> 01:02:56.946
and you are
a very valuable piece,

01:02:57.107 --> 01:02:58.643
like my bishop.

01:02:58.808 --> 01:03:00.253
I need you in the game.

01:03:00.410 --> 01:03:02.356
What do you want?

01:03:02.512 --> 01:03:05.686
I have what I want.
I'm trusting you with it.

01:03:05.849 --> 01:03:07.522
What is this?

01:03:07.684 --> 01:03:09.459
That's my pawn.

01:03:09.619 --> 01:03:11.030
She'll bring him right to you.

01:03:12.422 --> 01:03:16.199
- The American?
- Yep, your enemy.

01:03:16.359 --> 01:03:18.703
The man who killed
your brothers.

01:03:18.862 --> 01:03:21.206
I will find him myself.

01:03:21.364 --> 01:03:23.935
I don't need to
kidnap babies to do it.

01:03:24.100 --> 01:03:26.546
Why are you keeping me here?

01:03:26.703 --> 01:03:29.274
Because I need you there,
that's why.

01:03:29.439 --> 01:03:31.043
And I need him there, too,

01:03:31.207 --> 01:03:33.153
alive and drawing fire
in his direction.

01:03:33.310 --> 01:03:36.655
See, the you-versus-him thing,
that's just a diversion.

01:03:36.813 --> 01:03:39.054
The real battle's bigger
than both of you,

01:03:39.215 --> 01:03:42.389
and you're just a soldier,
so take your fuckin' orders.

01:03:43.687 --> 01:03:46.167
Fuckin' Count Chocula-looking
motherfucker.

01:03:47.223 --> 01:03:49.328
- Sir.
- Just keep it going.

01:03:55.999 --> 01:03:58.001
Welcome to Westminster Station.

01:03:58.168 --> 01:04:00.239
If you are riding
the Piccadilly Line,

01:04:00.403 --> 01:04:02.383
mind the gap.

01:04:02.539 --> 01:04:05.042
Next stop, Piccadilly Circus.

01:04:31.234 --> 01:04:33.737
Well, there she is.

01:04:36.039 --> 01:04:38.280
Give me a kiss.

01:04:38.441 --> 01:04:41.115
Come on, that's what you do.
We're in Europe.

01:04:41.277 --> 01:04:42.950
What do you got for me?

01:04:43.113 --> 01:04:45.354
I have information.

01:04:45.515 --> 01:04:47.756
Come on.
Let's go for a walk.

01:04:52.389 --> 01:04:55.598
I just-Since getting here,
I feel like shit.

01:04:55.759 --> 01:04:57.636
It's always dark.
It always rains.

01:04:57.794 --> 01:05:01.537
And I know it sounds crazy,
I kind of miss my wife.

01:05:01.698 --> 01:05:04.110
What do you got for me?

01:05:04.267 --> 01:05:06.304
Here. Come over here.

01:05:07.937 --> 01:05:10.713
So, I've got good news,

01:05:10.874 --> 01:05:12.410
and I've got bad news.

01:05:12.575 --> 01:05:14.885
The good news is I found Jade.

01:05:15.044 --> 01:05:18.821
The bad news is
she's in Yerevan, Armenia.

01:05:18.982 --> 01:05:20.484
Fuck!
Again with the Armenians?

01:05:20.650 --> 01:05:23.563
That Andreas has
a real hard-on for you.

01:05:23.720 --> 01:05:26.400
You told me they were both dead,
they died when the chopper blew up.

01:05:26.489 --> 01:05:28.799
It was bad intel.
I know.

01:05:28.958 --> 01:05:30.918
You're gonna run into Red
while you're there, too.

01:05:30.960 --> 01:05:32.405
She's kind of runnin'
the show down there.

01:05:32.429 --> 01:05:33.772
She's a real bitch.

01:05:33.930 --> 01:05:36.843
They sold my family
to the Armenians.

01:05:37.000 --> 01:05:39.446
You know it's a trap, right?

01:05:39.602 --> 01:05:41.013
They're gonna fucking kill you.

01:05:41.171 --> 01:05:43.845
I don't even know
why you're going.

01:05:44.007 --> 01:05:46.920
- Thanks for this.
- No problem, man.

01:05:47.076 --> 01:05:48.987
All right, good luck.

01:05:49.145 --> 01:05:51.182
I hope you don't die.

01:06:17.273 --> 01:06:19.549
So you are his girl, huh?

01:06:21.110 --> 01:06:24.182
You know he killed
my cousins, too?

01:06:30.553 --> 01:06:32.897
If I find out
you were involved in it,

01:06:33.056 --> 01:06:36.902
I will come back and smash
your neck just like this.

01:06:41.231 --> 01:06:43.040
But, you know,

01:06:43.199 --> 01:06:44.735
I'm a good babysitter as well.

01:07:19.102 --> 01:07:22.879
- Can I help you?
- I can't babysit this thing forever.

01:07:25.074 --> 01:07:27.452
Is that what you
came in here to say?

01:07:29.779 --> 01:07:31.122
This is fucking bullshit.

01:07:34.183 --> 01:07:37.392
Welcome to Yerevan.
It's nice, huh?

01:07:37.554 --> 01:07:39.363
Okay, look right there.
See the big guy'?

01:07:39.522 --> 01:07:42.128
That's The Lion.
That's Andreas' bodyguard.

01:07:42.292 --> 01:07:44.294
Follow him,
and you'll find Andreas.

01:07:44.460 --> 01:07:46.440
Find Andreas,
and you'll find your family.

01:07:46.596 --> 01:07:48.596
A kid will approach you tonight
at the opera house.

01:07:48.631 --> 01:07:50.110
Okay, ciao.

01:09:17.319 --> 01:09:20.665
- How the fuck do you shut this up?
- Give her to me.

01:09:20.823 --> 01:09:24.635
- I can't.
- Give her to me. She's hungry.

01:09:26.863 --> 01:09:28.899
I said no.

01:09:29.064 --> 01:09:32.410
Red, give me the baby.

01:09:32.568 --> 01:09:34.639
You work for me.

01:09:34.804 --> 01:09:36.477
Not anymore.

01:09:36.639 --> 01:09:38.743
Fuck!

01:10:12.408 --> 01:10:13.944
Amen.

01:10:31.794 --> 01:10:33.865
<i>My soul.</i>

01:10:35.298 --> 01:10:37.539
I sold my soul.

01:11:58.781 --> 01:12:00.658
Andreas.

01:12:02.051 --> 01:12:04.122
They're ready for you.

01:12:05.488 --> 01:12:07.161
They need you.

01:12:07.323 --> 01:12:09.360
Go without me.

01:12:12.061 --> 01:12:14.302
I need you.

Holy shit, bro.

01:15:15.077 --> 01:15:17.079
It was a boring conversation,
anyway.

01:15:48.044 --> 01:15:50.422
This is fucking ridiculous.

01:15:53.249 --> 01:15:55.889
I agree.
This is fucking ridiculous.

01:15:56.052 --> 01:15:57.759
Don't make a scene.

01:15:57.920 --> 01:16:00.526
And, you,
this isn't gonna be like last time.

01:16:00.689 --> 01:16:03.636
This is gonna be

Now move.

01:16:12.134 --> 01:16:14.205
Move!

01:16:17.473 --> 01:16:20.079
Somebody help me!

01:16:20.242 --> 01:16:22.415
Please! I feel sick!

01:16:27.483 --> 01:16:29.895
I feel sick.

01:16:30.052 --> 01:16:31.692
I don't feel good.

01:16:46.469 --> 01:16:48.107
Mommy's here.

01:16:48.270 --> 01:16:50.307
Shh.

01:17:04.854 --> 01:17:07.698
- You are fucking dead.
- I heard that before.

01:17:07.857 --> 01:17:09.377
- You will never...
- Shut the fuck up.

01:17:09.458 --> 01:17:11.028
You don't get to talk.

01:17:19.201 --> 01:17:22.341
- Don't even think about it.
- We've been here before.

01:17:23.706 --> 01:17:25.879
Andreas?

01:17:26.041 --> 01:17:27.543
Just tell me where she is.

01:17:27.710 --> 01:17:29.712
I don't think so.

01:17:29.879 --> 01:17:32.985
- You think I'm playing?
- No, I don't.

01:17:33.149 --> 01:17:35.720
A-Andreas,
don't... don't do this!

01:17:38.154 --> 01:17:41.226
Get down! Get down!

01:18:33.209 --> 01:18:35.246
Just fucking great!

01:19:07.142 --> 01:19:08.587
What?

01:19:21.824 --> 01:19:23.895
Go right! Go right!

01:19:47.650 --> 01:19:49.687
Shit.

01:20:04.366 --> 01:20:06.437
What the fuck?

01:20:12.708 --> 01:20:14.710
I got this motherfucker!

01:21:42.531 --> 01:21:43.942
Where is she?

01:21:45.634 --> 01:21:47.705
Where's my family?

01:22:56.705 --> 01:22:59.208
You know it's not over.

01:22:59.374 --> 01:23:02.014
I know.

01:23:14.623 --> 01:23:16.227
- You just land'!
- Yeah.

01:23:16.391 --> 01:23:18.029
- Where are they?
- Safe.

01:23:18.193 --> 01:23:20.571
What the fuck is going on?

01:23:20.729 --> 01:23:22.800
Desmond Barrington
is what the fuck's going on.

01:23:22.965 --> 01:23:24.239
Barrington's behind this shit?

01:23:24.399 --> 01:23:27.039
Desmond Barrington
was behind the whole thing.

01:23:27.202 --> 01:23:29.648
He played you.
He played the Armenians.

01:23:29.805 --> 01:23:32.411
He's been behind it
the whole fucking time, man.

01:23:32.574 --> 01:23:35.077
And now, he's getting paid
to tip the global scales.

01:23:35.244 --> 01:23:37.690
- Where's Barrington now'?
- He's here in Los Angeles.

01:23:37.846 --> 01:23:40.019
Look, you're gonna
see him tonight

01:23:40.182 --> 01:23:41.752
at a high rollers game, okay?

01:23:41.917 --> 01:23:43.260
You're gonna have to look slick,

01:23:43.418 --> 01:23:45.830
none of that Call of Duty armor
bullshit, okay?

01:23:45.988 --> 01:23:48.161
- You got a tux?
- Tux? Why?

01:23:48.323 --> 01:23:51.600
- New Kid will fill you in.
- Wait. The New Kid?

01:23:51.760 --> 01:23:53.671
Yeah.
You can thank me later.

01:24:04.439 --> 01:24:06.043
Barry vouched for you?

01:24:06.208 --> 01:24:08.779
No. Barry vouched for you.

01:24:08.944 --> 01:24:10.116
I'm The New Kid.

01:24:10.279 --> 01:24:12.350
All right.

01:24:13.782 --> 01:24:15.090
Run it by me again.

01:24:15.250 --> 01:24:16.957
Members only.
No guns.

01:24:17.119 --> 01:24:18.962
Metal detectors and pat-downs.

01:24:19.121 --> 01:24:20.721
Barrington's in there tonight
celebrating

01:24:20.856 --> 01:24:22.056
some deal he's about to close.

01:24:22.124 --> 01:24:25.196
I get us in,
we find him, isolate him,

01:24:25.360 --> 01:24:28.136
squeeze him for intel,
then we pop him.

01:24:28.297 --> 01:24:30.641
No, we don't pop a guy
like Barrington.

01:24:30.799 --> 01:24:32.870
Your call.

01:24:34.136 --> 01:24:37.140
- You wearing that?
- Nah, brah.

01:24:37.306 --> 01:24:40.150

Don't worry about it.

Oh, let me guess.

01:27:53.835 --> 01:27:56.941
That psycho who thinks
he's a hero, huh?

01:28:00.509 --> 01:28:02.113
Fuck it.
Go ahead, right?

01:28:02.277 --> 01:28:04.450
I deserve it.

01:28:04.613 --> 01:28:06.490
I did just get paid
a billion dollars

01:28:06.648 --> 01:28:09.356
to set off nuclear IEDs
all over the city.

01:28:09.518 --> 01:28:13.193
Why don't you call that off
before I shoot you in the head?

01:28:13.355 --> 01:28:15.426
Better me than my friend.

01:28:15.590 --> 01:28:18.196
Nah, 'cause now it's time

01:28:18.360 --> 01:28:20.806
for my friend to come
and ruin everything.

01:28:24.800 --> 01:28:26.802
You chose
the wrong trick, bitch.

01:28:26.968 --> 01:28:28.879
As much as I'm into
the girl-on-girl action,

01:28:29.037 --> 01:28:32.985
I'd like to stay here and watch,
but you're dead already.

01:28:33.141 --> 01:28:35.178
Everyone in here is.

01:28:36.878 --> 01:28:39.290
Enjoy your evening.

01:28:39.447 --> 01:28:40.892
Where are you going?

01:29:02.838 --> 01:29:04.317
Come and get it.

01:29:04.472 --> 01:29:06.975
Oh, I plan on it, bitch.

01:29:14.916 --> 01:29:16.896
On!

01:29:17.052 --> 01:29:19.163
Security,
guy at the bar, take him out now!

01:29:19.187 --> 01:29:21.258
No guns! Tasers only!

01:29:38.273 --> 01:29:40.617
See, bitch?
I do my fucking job!

01:29:49.117 --> 01:29:51.461
You...

01:30:13.975 --> 01:30:15.453
Comm check. Get outside.

01:30:15.477 --> 01:30:17.548
The Kid has Barrington's driver.

01:30:20.982 --> 01:30:22.825
I'm just driving!
I don't know anything!

01:30:22.984 --> 01:30:26.261
- Tell me!
- I don't know!

01:30:26.421 --> 01:30:29.493
Okay, okay!

01:30:29.658 --> 01:30:32.662
- One more time, motherfucker!
- L.A. Live, P5.

01:30:32.827 --> 01:30:35.171
There's a bomb
in Bentley, old-school.

01:30:35.330 --> 01:30:37.901
You have to defuse by hand.

01:30:45.073 --> 01:30:46.746
Fuck, you okay?

01:30:46.908 --> 01:30:50.583
Barrington's on foot.
He's got IEDs set all over the city.

01:30:50.745 --> 01:30:52.691
He's got the abort codes
on his phone.

01:30:52.847 --> 01:30:55.293
Make the call.
You take care of that.

01:30:59.154 --> 01:31:00.665
Okay, it's game time, guys.

01:31:00.689 --> 01:31:02.166
All right, we can't let Barrington
get away.

01:31:02.190 --> 01:31:03.401
World, like,
literally depends on it.

01:31:03.425 --> 01:31:05.505
- Kid, where are we at?
- This is the parking garage.

01:31:05.627 --> 01:31:07.334
Find the Bentley, P5.

01:31:07.495 --> 01:31:09.031
The L.A. bomb's
just a diversion, guys.

01:31:09.197 --> 01:31:10.938
He's taking out cities
all over the world.

01:31:11.099 --> 01:31:13.110
Yeah, well, even his diversion's
gonna level downtown.

01:31:13.134 --> 01:31:14.772
We've got no time.
This comes first.

01:31:14.936 --> 01:31:16.609
Oh, relax.
I got a guy on it.

01:31:18.039 --> 01:31:20.110
Aw, hell, nah.

01:31:21.676 --> 01:31:23.986
Hey, man, you got me
out here all dressed up.

01:31:24.145 --> 01:31:26.216
Man, I'm lookin' fly
as hell tonight, man.

01:31:26.381 --> 01:31:27.541
I was supposed to be the bomb.

01:31:27.615 --> 01:31:29.617
You didn't tell me that
there was a real bomb!

01:31:29.784 --> 01:31:32.663
What am I supposed to do
with this shit, man?

01:31:32.821 --> 01:31:34.858
I ain't messing my uncle's tux.

01:31:41.062 --> 01:31:43.736
Click, click, motherfucker.

01:31:43.898 --> 01:31:45.900
Now toss your shit.

01:32:03.852 --> 01:32:06.924
- What you go! going on here'!
- Mall cop, get the fuck out of here.

01:32:07.088 --> 01:32:10.160
- This is a dirty bomb.
- Still can't park here.

01:32:10.325 --> 01:32:13.602
I ain't playing with you.
This shit can fuck up the whole city.

01:32:15.663 --> 01:32:18.234
So, that's an actual bomb?

01:32:18.400 --> 01:32:20.243
Damn right.

01:32:20.402 --> 01:32:22.575
<i>Okay '</i>

01:32:24.205 --> 01:32:26.185
Yo, what's up, man?
How this gonna go down'?

01:32:26.341 --> 01:32:28.685
- Walk me through this shit.
- Walk you through it?

01:32:28.843 --> 01:32:30.015
I thought you were demo!

01:32:30.178 --> 01:32:31.756
Look, I'm too busy
to help you out, all right?

01:32:31.780 --> 01:32:33.357
I'm getting pings
from all over the world...

01:32:33.381 --> 01:32:36.794
New York, Sydney,
Hong Kong, Mumbai.

01:32:36.951 --> 01:32:39.295
If Vigilante doesn't get Barrington,
we are fucked!

01:32:39.454 --> 01:32:40.455
We're so fucked!

01:32:40.622 --> 01:32:42.262
Vigilante has to get to
Barrington's cell.

01:32:42.290 --> 01:32:44.702
That's where the codes are at.
It's inside his jacket pocket.

01:32:50.231 --> 01:32:53.144
Still don't understand
how things work, do you?

01:32:53.301 --> 01:32:54.803
I guess I don't work that way.

01:32:54.969 --> 01:32:57.813
Clearly.
That's why your gun's over there.

01:33:01.242 --> 01:33:03.279
What?

01:33:07.816 --> 01:33:09.557
Ah, fuck.

01:33:27.669 --> 01:33:30.172
You think I'm a bad guy.

01:33:30.338 --> 01:33:31.783
Whatever.

01:33:31.940 --> 01:33:35.080
You ever heard
of the trolley problem?

01:33:35.243 --> 01:33:37.189
Fuckin' trolley?

01:33:37.345 --> 01:33:39.291
It's 2016, man,
there's fucking Uber.

01:33:39.447 --> 01:33:42.587
No, the trolley problem.
It's a dilemma.

01:33:42.750 --> 01:33:46.459
Okay, there's a runaway trolley
on a track.

01:33:46.621 --> 01:33:49.465
There's five people
tied to that track.

01:33:49.624 --> 01:33:52.969
Now, there's one person
tied to another track,

01:33:53.128 --> 01:33:56.769
and there's a switch that
diverts the trolley, okay?

01:33:56.931 --> 01:33:58.933
Now, do you let nature
take its course

01:33:59.100 --> 01:34:01.706
and let those five people
get killed by that trolley,

01:34:01.870 --> 01:34:03.713
or do you flip the switch?

01:34:03.872 --> 01:34:07.684
See, me...
I flip the switch every time,

01:34:07.842 --> 01:34:12.484
whether it's 500,000 people
saving 500 million.

01:34:12.647 --> 01:34:14.786
You get it?

01:34:14.949 --> 01:34:17.225
That makes you feel good?

01:34:17.385 --> 01:34:19.456
Yeah.

01:34:21.556 --> 01:34:23.627
Yeah.

01:34:26.995 --> 01:34:29.236
That bomb downtown...

01:34:29.397 --> 01:34:32.401
I got a "Hurt Locker" genius
working on it right now.

01:34:32.567 --> 01:34:34.740
There's no bomb he can't defuse.

01:34:34.903 --> 01:34:36.143
Oh, baby Jesus, please help me.

01:34:36.237 --> 01:34:38.342
Why do these wires
gotta be so small?

01:34:38.506 --> 01:34:41.077
- Such thick fingers.
- Man, shut up!

01:34:41.242 --> 01:34:43.387
I don't think you're supposed
to sweat on those like that.

01:34:43.411 --> 01:34:45.851
You gonna do the red wire?
It's always the red wire in movies.

01:34:45.914 --> 01:34:49.020
- Are you a bomb specialist?
- No, but 17...

01:34:49.184 --> 01:34:50.424
- No, no, don't do that.
- 15...

01:34:50.585 --> 01:34:52.064
- Shut up! Don't do that!
- 13...

01:34:52.220 --> 01:34:53.900
- Shut up! Shut up.
- Stay calm, stay calm.

01:34:54.022 --> 01:34:57.094
- 15 seconds! Stay calm!
- Shut up!

01:34:59.260 --> 01:35:00.705
Fuck it.

01:35:00.862 --> 01:35:04.241
- Ha ha! Booyah!
- That worked'?!

01:35:04.399 --> 01:35:06.343
- What's my name?! What's my name?!
- I don't know!

01:35:06.367 --> 01:35:08.870
Oh, my God.
We saved the city!

01:35:09.037 --> 01:35:11.608
- I-I saved the city.
- You saved the city!

01:35:13.107 --> 01:35:15.280
- I saved the city, man.
- You fuckin' saved the city!

01:35:15.443 --> 01:35:18.287
- I did it! I did it!
- My black person.

01:35:18.446 --> 01:35:21.052
Watch your mouth.

01:35:22.450 --> 01:35:24.896
L.A.'s good.
Barry, where we at?

01:35:25.053 --> 01:35:27.863
Hey, good job, Wolfie, but let's
not jerk each other off just yet,

01:35:28.022 --> 01:35:30.866
'cause the main event's
about to go live worldwide.

01:35:31.025 --> 01:35:32.732
Shit!
Am I seeing this right'?

01:35:32.894 --> 01:35:34.703
There's surges all over.

01:35:43.571 --> 01:35:45.312
That Pakistani guy
you chopped up...

01:35:45.473 --> 01:35:46.884
I don't know.

01:35:46.908 --> 01:35:48.251
I don't know.

01:35:48.409 --> 01:35:51.049
These guys
ain't too happy about it.

01:35:51.212 --> 01:35:53.317
Get in the car!

01:35:55.116 --> 01:35:57.255
Get in the fucking car!

01:36:15.737 --> 01:36:18.081
Tell me you've got that phone!

01:36:18.239 --> 01:36:20.084
He did and took an arm
for it, didn't you? Ouch.

01:36:20.108 --> 01:36:21.519
Here's (he abort hack.
Go.

01:36:21.676 --> 01:36:24.953
We've got Barrington. He's safe.

01:36:25.113 --> 01:36:28.856
- Where to now, boss?
- We head outside the blast radius

01:36:29.017 --> 01:36:30.963
and get ready for detonation.

01:36:37.091 --> 01:36:38.866
<i>That motherfucker.</i>

01:36:39.027 --> 01:36:40.971
These are ready
to launch, man, right now!

01:36:40.995 --> 01:36:42.838
1-1 -3-8. Type it in.

01:36:42.997 --> 01:36:45.944
- Okay, I got it.
- 1-1... What's your deal?

01:36:46.100 --> 01:36:47.545
I got it.

01:36:47.702 --> 01:36:49.204
Oh, shit!

01:36:49.370 --> 01:36:51.015
- Fuck, I had it upside down.
- Are you serious?!

01:36:51.039 --> 01:36:54.213
- Oh, my God! Come on!
- We're responsible for the apocalypse!

01:36:54.375 --> 01:36:57.379
Bye-bye, London.
Tokyo, you're gone.

01:36:57.545 --> 01:36:58.789
I don't even want to watch.
I don't even want lo watch.

01:36:58.813 --> 01:36:59.893
I don't even want to watch.

01:37:06.788 --> 01:37:08.790
Ho... holy shit, we did it!

01:37:08.956 --> 01:37:10.993
Ha! We did it!

01:37:11.159 --> 01:37:13.639
Oh, my God! Oh, my God.

01:37:13.795 --> 01:37:16.241
Hey, guys,
I'm gonna give you all BJs!

01:37:16.397 --> 01:37:20.038
- We saved the fuckin' world, man.
- I'm coming to get you, V.

01:37:26.908 --> 01:37:28.910
The Vigilante is definitely back.

01:37:29.077 --> 01:37:33.025
A bloodbath tonight at a downtown
Los Angeles nightspot.

01:37:33.181 --> 01:37:34.781
Over here outside
a downtown nightclub...

01:37:34.916 --> 01:37:36.759
- The Vigilante...
- El Vigilante...

01:37:36.918 --> 01:37:38.420
- Vigilante!
- Vigilante!

01:37:38.586 --> 01:37:39.860
Continuing coverage tonight.

01:37:40.021 --> 01:37:42.592
I'm joined by Mike Hanover,
web filmmaker,

01:37:42.757 --> 01:37:46.261
famous for his viral hit,
"The Vigilante Diaries,"

01:37:46.427 --> 01:37:49.408
and it appears that
The Vigilante is back.

01:37:49.564 --> 01:37:52.067
That's right. He's back.
I'm back. We're back, man.

01:37:52.233 --> 01:37:53.610
I'm the guy behind the guy.

01:37:53.768 --> 01:37:55.179
That was me.
I put him on the Web.

01:37:55.336 --> 01:37:57.577
I made his **** famous.
That's right.

01:37:57.739 --> 01:38:00.777
So what about the reports we're hearing
that The Vigilante saved the city?

01:38:00.942 --> 01:38:03.354
Uh, he saved the city.
I saved the city.

01:38:03.511 --> 01:38:06.458
- That's what we do, all right?
- We save ****.

01:38:06.614 --> 01:38:09.117
Last month, we saved the city
from a mob, a big mob.

01:38:09.283 --> 01:38:11.095
And you know what,
he went overseas without me,

01:38:11.119 --> 01:38:12.763
and I'm not gonna
hold that against you, Vigi,

01:38:12.787 --> 01:38:14.331
but, you know what,
I like fish and chips

01:38:14.355 --> 01:38:15.857
and pints and all that
good stuff.

01:38:16.023 --> 01:38:17.434
But I'm here
holding down the fort.

01:38:17.592 --> 01:38:18.969
I'm here in The City of Angels.

01:38:19.127 --> 01:38:21.073
You know Bond's guy,
the intel guy?

01:38:21.229 --> 01:38:23.971
I'm that guy, but I'm better.
That's right. Umph!

01:38:24.132 --> 01:38:25.634
Okay, we'll keep this on topic.

01:38:25.800 --> 01:38:28.545
So, does that mean that you're still
involved in The Vigilante's affairs?

01:38:28.569 --> 01:38:29.729
That's what I've been saying.

01:38:29.804 --> 01:38:33.149
I'm always involved, involved some way,
one way or another, right?

01:38:33.307 --> 01:38:35.810
So, Vigi, hit me up, man.
I'm ready for that next mission.

01:38:35.977 --> 01:38:38.617
- I got a new camera.
- I can document the **** out of it!

01:38:38.780 --> 01:38:41.158
And you can come, too,
if you want, girl.

01:38:41.315 --> 01:38:43.454
Uh, okay.
Uh, thanks.

01:38:43.618 --> 01:38:45.495
Uh, we're gonna toss it
back to the studio.

01:38:45.653 --> 01:38:47.428
Tossing... salad.

01:38:51.726 --> 01:38:55.674
- That's one hell of a story.
- Yeah, it's damn good, isn't it'?

01:38:55.830 --> 01:38:58.834
One more for my colleague
over here.

01:39:00.735 --> 01:39:03.511
I gotta know...

01:39:03.671 --> 01:39:06.413
100% that you're in.

01:39:06.574 --> 01:39:09.748
You know you should have had me
in the loop from the start, right'?

01:39:09.911 --> 01:39:11.982
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

01:39:12.146 --> 01:39:14.023
Could have saved you
a lot of time and money.

01:39:14.182 --> 01:39:16.924
Lot of motherfuckers
would still be alive, too.

01:39:19.020 --> 01:39:21.660
Yeah, then there's that.

01:39:21.823 --> 01:39:24.633
- But I wanted to do it my own way.
- Yeah.

01:39:24.792 --> 01:39:28.365
If you want to catch
Frankenstein's monster,

01:39:28.529 --> 01:39:30.531
you don't use Count Chocula

01:39:30.698 --> 01:39:33.542
or the Wolfman
or the "Mommy."

01:39:35.203 --> 01:39:37.012
- "Mommy." Yeah, that's funny.
- Yeah.

01:39:37.171 --> 01:39:38.548
You threw that in there.

01:39:38.706 --> 01:39:40.982
You want to catch the monster,

01:39:41.142 --> 01:39:43.122
use the Invisible Man.

01:39:45.379 --> 01:39:47.188
I'll bring him in.

01:39:47.348 --> 01:39:50.124
Well, yeah,

01:39:50.284 --> 01:39:52.389
but make sure he's still alive,

01:39:52.553 --> 01:39:56.660
'cause he's very fuckin' expensive.

01:39:56.824 --> 01:39:58.565
Don't make a mess.

01:40:01.729 --> 01:40:03.902
They came in before you did.

01:40:09.036 --> 01:40:11.380
So...

01:40:11.539 --> 01:40:13.576
you want the guy playing
with his phone,

01:40:13.741 --> 01:40:15.721
or the clown with
the H.K. behind us

01:40:15.877 --> 01:40:17.686
pretending like he's drunk?

01:40:17.845 --> 01:40:20.416
I think I'll take
the guy on the phone.

01:40:29.423 --> 01:40:31.733
Ow!

01:40:37.098 --> 01:40:39.374
Sorry about the mess.

01:40:39.534 --> 01:40:41.912
I'll see you next time, bro.

01:40:44.772 --> 01:40:47.116
I'm fucking hungry, man.

01:40:47.275 --> 01:40:48.879
Let's go get something to eat.

There's a shipment of heroin and AK-47's
being smuggled into San Diego.
