00:24.757 --> 00:26.725
<i>Previously on</i> Titans...

00:26.792 --> 00:27.817
It's you.

00:27.818 --> 00:30.763
- I'm not sure...
- You're the boy from the circus.

00:30.830 --> 00:35.831
<i>Your parents...
I watched them fall.</i>

00:36.301 --> 00:37.570
Can you help me?

00:37.637 --> 00:40.205
Trigon. This being was
summoned to Earth

00:40.206 --> 00:41.841
- to conceive a daughter.
- Rachel.

00:41.908 --> 00:44.110
She is the doorway
that he can walk through.

00:44.177 --> 00:49.177
Earth will be the first planet that
he will cover in his darkness.

00:49.247 --> 00:50.350
We need a doctor in here!

00:50.415 --> 00:52.518
We need to find
Jason Todd.

00:52.585 --> 00:54.253
<i>Rachel needs our help.</i>

00:54.320 --> 00:55.454
He's dying.

00:55.521 --> 00:56.799
Your father,
he could save Gar.

00:56.823 --> 00:59.192
<i>Bring him to me.
Bring him home.</i>

01:06.265 --> 01:08.167
<i>My child.</i>

01:08.233 --> 01:10.236
<i>I'm finally home.</i>

01:10.302 --> 01:12.305
What the fuck
is going on?

01:12.371 --> 01:15.441
- It's shimmering.
- Dick, wait!

01:15.507 --> 01:17.275
Is it time
to eat the world?

01:17.343 --> 01:20.945
Not until
her heart breaks.

01:21.013 --> 01:23.750
Dick, please... talk to me.

01:23.816 --> 01:25.284
This was not my doing.

01:25.350 --> 01:26.819
I offered your friend a path.

01:26.887 --> 01:30.322
<i>Ultimately,
he chose his own way.</i>

01:30.390 --> 01:32.393
Fuck you, Bruce. You win.

01:32.459 --> 01:36.462
<i>To embrace his darkness
rather than deny its existence.</i>

01:36.528 --> 01:40.031
I've released your friend
from a terrible burden.

01:40.099 --> 01:44.170
It feels so good
to be home.

01:44.236 --> 01:47.072
You'll see.

01:47.138 --> 01:49.539
They'll all see.

01:55.447 --> 01:58.884
No.

01:58.950 --> 02:02.987
Let him go.

02:03.055 --> 02:05.257
Let him go.

02:06.626 --> 02:09.794
I'm afraid
you're grounded.

02:09.860 --> 02:11.062
No more magic.

02:11.129 --> 02:12.931
I won't let you do this.

02:12.997 --> 02:15.033
Let me?

02:15.100 --> 02:16.735
You did this.

02:16.802 --> 02:18.604
You brought me
here, Rachel.

02:18.670 --> 02:22.641
Your purpose was to bring me
into your world.

02:22.709 --> 02:25.377
The whole journey you've
taken with your friends,

02:25.444 --> 02:27.781
it's all been to make
this moment happen.

02:27.847 --> 02:30.483
I couldn't be
more proud.

02:30.550 --> 02:32.718
You've given this world
a gift.

02:32.786 --> 02:35.854
You never loved me.

02:35.920 --> 02:37.923
You used me.

02:37.990 --> 02:39.491
Oh, sweet girl,

02:39.558 --> 02:42.294
this is so much more
important than love.

02:42.360 --> 02:43.663
Just let him go.

02:43.729 --> 02:45.132
Look around you, daughter.

02:45.198 --> 02:50.869
All there is here is loss,
betrayal, and decay.

02:50.870 --> 02:54.372
Everyone you love will leave you
by their own hand or in ashes.

02:54.439 --> 02:56.342
Nothing lasts.

02:56.409 --> 02:59.444
The only thing that awaits
you is disappointment.

02:59.512 --> 03:02.548
You will lose everyone.

03:02.615 --> 03:05.518
It's heartbreaking,
isn't it?

03:05.585 --> 03:08.420
Let your heart break.

03:08.487 --> 03:11.223
It's inevitable.

03:11.289 --> 03:14.193
And then
you'll be free to join me.

03:14.259 --> 03:17.430
Our future will be glorious.

03:17.497 --> 03:19.498
Uh... hard pass.

03:19.566 --> 03:20.734
Rach, we gotta go.

03:20.800 --> 03:24.670
- Gar.
- Run!

03:24.737 --> 03:28.106
She wants to do it
the hard way.

03:28.174 --> 03:32.878
You know what to do.

03:32.945 --> 03:35.313
I should've
prepared her better.

03:35.381 --> 03:38.383
We've waited too long
to fail now.

03:38.450 --> 03:40.218
We will not fail.

03:40.286 --> 03:43.455
Patience, my dear.

03:43.522 --> 03:47.727
One way or another,
her heart will break.

03:47.794 --> 03:52.743
And then this world
will be mine.

04:13.051 --> 04:17.589
Whoo!

04:33.973 --> 04:36.072
That was sick.

04:41.045 --> 04:42.348
Epic.

04:42.415 --> 04:44.216
Don't tell me.

04:44.283 --> 04:46.586
You're Jason Todd.

04:46.653 --> 04:49.387
Yeah, and who the hell
are you?

04:49.454 --> 04:51.824
I'm Dawn Granger.
This is Hank Hall.

04:51.891 --> 04:53.959
Rachel sent us
to find you.

04:54.026 --> 04:55.495
Why me?

04:55.562 --> 04:57.796
Our hunch is she needs the guy
you work for and not you.

04:57.797 --> 04:59.498
I don't know what the hell
you're talking about.

04:59.499 --> 05:01.532
Relax, killer. I'm Dove.

05:01.533 --> 05:02.823
This is Hawk.

05:02.824 --> 05:05.104
- We're friends of Dick Grayson.
- What kind of friends?

05:05.105 --> 05:08.007
The kind that know about
the big, scary cave downstairs.

05:12.978 --> 05:14.814
Does that ring a bell?

05:14.880 --> 05:19.418
You want me to make
bird sounds, too?

05:19.485 --> 05:22.189
- Titans.
- Just tell us where your dad is at, kid.

05:22.254 --> 05:26.192
Bruce is halfway across the world
with the rest of the Justice League.

05:26.257 --> 05:27.560
Alfred, too.

05:27.627 --> 05:30.329
Got this place
all to myself!

05:30.396 --> 05:31.595
Clearly.

05:31.596 --> 05:32.931
Hey, look. Whatever
you need Bruce for,

05:32.932 --> 05:35.668
if Dick needs help,
I'm your guy.

05:35.735 --> 05:37.970
I mean, one Robin saving another?

05:37.971 --> 05:39.436
They'll never let him
hear the end of it.

05:39.437 --> 05:40.605
You're the new Robin?

05:40.673 --> 05:43.175
Present and
accounted for, babe.

05:43.242 --> 05:45.845
"Babe"?

05:45.911 --> 05:47.547
What did he just say?

05:47.612 --> 05:49.014
And that's a pass
on the help

05:49.081 --> 05:50.949
from heroes-on-training-wheels
department.

05:51.016 --> 05:52.528
First off, bro, I'd put you
on your ass in three seconds.

05:52.552 --> 05:54.220
Okay, you little shit.

05:54.221 --> 05:56.788
And secondly, if Dick's really
strapped, I wanna help him.

05:56.855 --> 06:00.192
Kinda freaked out on him
last time and I owe him.

06:00.259 --> 06:04.096
So where is he?

06:04.163 --> 06:06.665
- We don't know.
- Okay, well, then you need me.

06:06.733 --> 06:08.100
Dick's got a tracker
in him.

06:08.168 --> 06:10.603
Nice try, Speed.
He disabled it.

06:10.670 --> 06:12.637
Got a big ol' scar
to prove it.

06:12.704 --> 06:14.540
Let's bounce.

06:14.607 --> 06:17.076
He didn't tell you
about the second one?

06:17.142 --> 06:19.877
It's in a place
he's never gonna find.

06:19.944 --> 06:21.814
Ew.

06:21.880 --> 06:23.649
Just tell us where he is.

06:23.716 --> 06:27.252
We can access it on the Batcomputer
if you let me come with you guys.

06:27.319 --> 06:28.887
I'm gonna kill this kid.

06:28.954 --> 06:31.656
Kill him after we find Dick.

06:31.723 --> 06:33.973
You got a deal.

06:44.004 --> 06:45.672
Would you just
stop blasting it?

06:45.737 --> 06:47.439
You're wasting
all your power.

06:47.507 --> 06:50.408
Rachel is in there.

06:50.475 --> 06:51.944
Anything could be
happening to her.

06:52.012 --> 06:53.848
Says the woman who was
sent here to kill her.

06:53.913 --> 06:56.192
Okay, now that she and Dick are in
there with some intergalactic demon,

06:56.216 --> 06:58.416
maybe you could try something
that might actually work?

06:58.483 --> 07:00.386
Like what, Donna?

07:00.387 --> 07:03.624
Or were you hoping the sheer force
of your criticism would save her?

07:03.690 --> 07:06.593
At least I'm not draining my powers
just because I can't sit still.

07:06.660 --> 07:09.562
- Says the Titan who quit.
- You really wanna go there right now?

07:15.067 --> 07:17.036
Hey, don't stop
on my account.

07:17.103 --> 07:19.338
- I like where that was heading.
- Jason?

07:19.406 --> 07:21.841
That's right! The goddamn
cavalry has arrived.

07:21.908 --> 07:25.379
What the fuck is that? And why
is it wearing Dick's costume?

07:25.444 --> 07:29.649
- The new and improved Robin.
- The annoying new Robin.

07:29.716 --> 07:31.718
Who's your friend?

07:31.783 --> 07:35.286
Um, Hank, Dawn,
this is Kory Anders.

07:35.353 --> 07:38.624
- She's an alien.
- What?

07:38.690 --> 07:40.125
What? It's true.

07:40.192 --> 07:42.928
You could've put a little
more love into that.

07:42.995 --> 07:46.499
Well, I wish we were meeting
under better circumstances.

07:46.565 --> 07:48.000
Why are you guys here?

07:48.067 --> 07:51.036
Rachel got inside of her
head at the hospital.

07:51.103 --> 07:53.872
Yeah, I think she woke
me up from my coma.

07:53.939 --> 07:56.108
She's in there, isn't she?

07:56.175 --> 07:59.846
- Yeah.
- So what the fuck is going on here?

07:59.913 --> 08:02.182
Rachel's father is
a being called Trigon.

08:02.249 --> 08:05.351
And if we can't stop him here,
he'll destroy your world.

08:05.418 --> 08:07.788
And move on,
destroying countless others.

08:07.855 --> 08:12.024
Our scripture states Trigon can
only fully inhabit your world

08:12.091 --> 08:14.060
after he breaks
Rachel's heart.

08:14.127 --> 08:15.728
We're talking metaphors,
right?

08:15.795 --> 08:18.798
We don't know, but if we don't
get through that force field

08:18.865 --> 08:21.100
and into the house in there,

08:21.166 --> 08:23.269
I'm afraid we're
never gonna find out.

08:23.336 --> 08:26.836
Kid should've asked us to get
fucking Superman.

08:29.642 --> 08:32.042
- No offense, but your dad is an asshole.
- Tell me about it.

08:39.652 --> 08:42.587
Oh, that's creepy.

08:42.654 --> 08:45.325
Come on.

08:45.392 --> 08:49.462
Rachel?
Come out and play.

08:49.528 --> 08:52.597
Come on,
we need to find a way out.

08:52.664 --> 08:57.235
What is happening?

08:58.370 --> 08:59.806
What is happening?

09:02.743 --> 09:06.445
It's my father. He's doing this.
He's trying to scare us.

09:06.511 --> 09:07.947
Guess what?

09:08.014 --> 09:12.063
It's de... finitely working.

09:15.788 --> 09:17.889
That dude is
totally messed up.

09:17.956 --> 09:20.058
What the hell
did he do to Dick?

09:20.125 --> 09:22.794
Whatever he did to Dick,
he wants to do to us as well.

09:22.861 --> 09:24.229
We gotta get
Dick back to normal.

09:24.230 --> 09:25.964
There's got to be some way
we can reach him.

09:25.965 --> 09:27.231
Make him hear me.

09:27.298 --> 09:29.067
Hello?

09:29.134 --> 09:33.239
Rachel? Where are you?

09:35.975 --> 09:38.445
This isn't right.
Believe me.

09:38.511 --> 09:41.014
This isn't how
it's supposed to end.

09:41.080 --> 09:43.950
She's right. It ends
with us all being together.

09:44.017 --> 09:45.083
Just let me in.

09:45.150 --> 09:46.918
I just want to
talk to you.

09:46.985 --> 09:50.254
That's what you wanted too,
isn't it, Rachel?

09:50.322 --> 09:51.724
To talk to me.

09:51.791 --> 09:53.558
To get through to me.

09:53.625 --> 09:56.863
To make me see
the light again.

09:56.928 --> 09:58.965
Well, here I am.

09:59.032 --> 10:01.268
I'm listening.

10:01.333 --> 10:04.403
Maybe we can
get through to him.

10:09.741 --> 10:12.611
Let's talk.

10:14.947 --> 10:18.650
Gar! The door.

10:18.717 --> 10:20.653
Rachel, look.

10:21.921 --> 10:23.456
They came.

10:23.523 --> 10:28.523
We have to get to them
before my father does.

10:37.870 --> 10:40.120
Hurry!

10:58.258 --> 11:00.259
Rachel's friends.

11:00.326 --> 11:02.328
They're coming to save her.

11:02.394 --> 11:07.394
And instead, they will
only hurry this along.

11:07.667 --> 11:10.216
Cue the rescuers.

11:13.440 --> 11:17.076
Oh, great.
That's not concerning.

11:17.143 --> 11:19.410
It looks like
someone's inviting us in.

11:19.477 --> 11:22.147
Invitation accepted!

11:22.214 --> 11:23.316
Titans...

11:23.383 --> 11:28.182
- Yes?
- And... new Robin.

11:29.587 --> 11:30.937
Let's go.

11:54.113 --> 11:56.215
- Kory?
- Rachel!

11:56.280 --> 11:58.616
Kory!

11:58.683 --> 12:00.319
Kory!

12:00.320 --> 12:02.821
- Are you okay?
- Trigon did something to Dick.

12:02.822 --> 12:05.057
- He changed him.
- What do you mean?

12:05.124 --> 12:06.925
- Where are the others?
- I don't know.

12:06.926 --> 12:08.494
They came in with me.
They should be here.

12:08.495 --> 12:10.229
You need to stop them
before he can get to them.

12:10.230 --> 12:11.529
Look, it might've
already happened.

12:11.530 --> 12:13.633
He does things to you
in your mind.

12:13.700 --> 12:16.535
Okay, just let me get you guys
out of here first, okay?

12:16.602 --> 12:18.803
No. You don't understand.
It's too late.

12:18.870 --> 12:23.370
No one is safe.
It's my fault.

12:24.342 --> 12:25.845
Kill me.

12:25.912 --> 12:27.514
What?

12:27.581 --> 12:29.225
It's the reason you came to
Earth in the first place.

12:29.249 --> 12:31.683
He'll use me
to take over our friends,

12:31.750 --> 12:33.552
everyone we love.

12:33.619 --> 12:35.153
They'll be his forever.

12:35.221 --> 12:36.556
It's the only way.

12:36.623 --> 12:40.491
- Rachel, this is crazy.
- Kory...

12:40.558 --> 12:43.294
Kill me.

12:43.361 --> 12:45.030
No. No.

12:45.097 --> 12:47.267
Kill me now!

12:47.332 --> 12:50.436
Do what you
came here to do.

12:54.941 --> 12:57.341
Just do it fast.

13:03.482 --> 13:05.918
Kory.

13:05.985 --> 13:08.386
Kory!

13:08.453 --> 13:11.590
Gar!

13:11.657 --> 13:14.807
I'm so sorry, Rachel.

13:34.779 --> 13:36.548
No. Vanilla.

13:36.615 --> 13:38.217
No. Chocolate.

13:38.283 --> 13:40.519
- Where am I?
- Dad, I don't know.

13:40.586 --> 13:43.188
Oh, Donna.
What a dilemma, huh?

13:43.255 --> 13:45.825
What is a dilemma?

13:45.892 --> 13:46.922
Dad?

13:46.923 --> 13:49.194
You don't
have to make a choice.

13:49.195 --> 13:51.264
- You can have both.
- Wow.

13:51.331 --> 13:52.598
On the house.

13:52.599 --> 13:53.864
Say "thank you," honey.

13:53.865 --> 13:57.015
- Thank you.
- Mmm-hmm.

14:00.038 --> 14:01.440
So what do you wanna
do now, Donna?

14:01.441 --> 14:03.374
Go to the park and
take pictures of the horses.

14:03.375 --> 14:04.676
Well, we better
go home and get your camera.

14:04.677 --> 14:05.944
Do you remember
where you left them?

14:05.945 --> 14:07.513
Oh, God.

14:07.580 --> 14:08.748
Not that day.

14:11.083 --> 14:12.183
I can save him.

14:15.087 --> 14:18.258
Dad!

14:21.894 --> 14:22.894
Dad!

14:27.700 --> 14:29.735
Dad!

14:37.643 --> 14:38.643
Dad?

14:43.916 --> 14:48.354
No!

14:48.421 --> 14:50.956
Daddy!

14:51.023 --> 14:52.023
Daddy!

14:57.096 --> 15:01.833
Daddy!

15:01.900 --> 15:02.900
Daddy!

15:16.749 --> 15:17.750
Hey!

15:17.817 --> 15:21.019
You.

15:21.086 --> 15:22.654
It was you. You did this.

15:24.789 --> 15:25.991
Why did you do it?

15:26.057 --> 15:27.927
Why did you set the fire?
Tell me!

15:27.994 --> 15:30.863
I can't help it! I...

15:30.929 --> 15:33.032
I like it when things burn.

15:33.099 --> 15:34.500
I'm sick.

15:34.566 --> 15:36.066
Arrest me.

15:41.307 --> 15:42.307
No.

16:10.336 --> 16:12.071
No, Bruce.

16:12.138 --> 16:13.172
No, no, Bruce!

16:13.239 --> 16:14.974
Bruce, wake up, man.

16:15.041 --> 16:16.240
No, Bruce.

16:16.241 --> 16:17.644
I saw Bruce's
future, Jason.

16:17.711 --> 16:20.346
Yeah, what the fuck
did you do, Dick?

16:20.413 --> 16:23.716
Batman was
going to break.

16:23.782 --> 16:25.518
Kill the Joker.

16:25.585 --> 16:29.054
Take down Gotham with him.

16:29.120 --> 16:32.759
He trained you
too well, Jason.

16:32.826 --> 16:35.961
You could break
just like him.

16:36.028 --> 16:40.378
You need to be
put down, too.

16:54.480 --> 16:55.981
You think you're
better than me?

16:56.048 --> 16:58.748
I didn't say that.

17:02.288 --> 17:05.325
You think you can
take my place?

17:05.391 --> 17:07.040
Dick, stop.

17:13.732 --> 17:18.531
You can be Robin
after I'm dead.

17:18.903 --> 17:20.739
If you insist.

17:42.827 --> 17:44.797
Give it up, Robin.

18:17.730 --> 18:22.468
The gun that killed
Bruce's parents.

18:22.535 --> 18:26.105
You don't actually think
he keeps it loaded?

18:26.172 --> 18:28.039
No.

18:28.106 --> 18:29.457
But I do.

18:45.424 --> 18:47.093
I shouldn't have
involved you.

18:49.194 --> 18:52.944
The coach was my problem.

19:07.446 --> 19:10.982
Hey, Hank.
I got your call.

19:11.049 --> 19:13.599
Special delivery.

19:34.205 --> 19:38.376
This will take
the pain away.

19:38.443 --> 19:40.078
It'll make you feel so good.

19:40.145 --> 19:42.781
I just want you, Hank.

19:42.848 --> 19:47.787
This'll help you
more than I ever could.

19:47.854 --> 19:51.190
It'll make you feel so good.

19:51.257 --> 19:53.726
Trust me, babe.

20:35.733 --> 20:38.471
You see?

20:38.538 --> 20:40.539
Everything's better now.

20:46.145 --> 20:51.116
Real life horror movie!
Real life horror movie!

20:51.182 --> 20:52.417
Oh!

20:52.484 --> 20:54.386
Thank God.

20:54.453 --> 20:58.054
You got in. You're here.

21:02.827 --> 21:04.029
No.

21:04.096 --> 21:07.232
Your children,
aren't they beautiful?

21:07.299 --> 21:09.501
I have only one child.

21:09.568 --> 21:14.406
And to her,
I would give the world.

21:14.473 --> 21:16.809
Rachel, what the hell?

21:16.875 --> 21:19.612
Don't fight it, Rachel.

21:19.679 --> 21:21.413
It's perfectly natural.

21:21.480 --> 21:22.749
It's who they are.

21:22.816 --> 21:24.584
It's who we all are inside.

21:24.651 --> 21:27.252
Don't listen to him.
That's not them.

21:27.319 --> 21:28.988
They're still in there.

21:29.054 --> 21:31.056
No.

21:31.123 --> 21:34.393
Cue the final betrayal.

21:34.460 --> 21:37.460
You know what to do.

21:40.365 --> 21:41.835
Gar.

21:41.901 --> 21:45.903
Uh, hey, guys.
It's me, Gar.

21:49.307 --> 21:52.008
No! Stop!

22:00.752 --> 22:02.220
Dick, please listen to me.

22:02.221 --> 22:04.155
Back in Detroit, remember,
it was just you and me,

22:04.156 --> 22:05.990
and I found you,
and I asked you for help,

22:06.057 --> 22:07.325
and you said yes.

22:07.326 --> 22:08.759
You said you would.
You said you would.

22:08.760 --> 22:10.730
You promised.
You promised.

22:10.797 --> 22:14.500
And if you can hear me now,
please help me.

22:14.567 --> 22:17.569
Please, please, stop them.

22:17.636 --> 22:20.005
Please.

22:20.071 --> 22:21.122
Please.

23:03.915 --> 23:05.384
No!

23:05.451 --> 23:08.319
No, no, no.

23:08.386 --> 23:10.037
No, no, no.

23:41.554 --> 23:44.123
Save him!

23:44.190 --> 23:46.592
Not this time.

23:46.659 --> 23:48.928
I told you it would end.

23:48.994 --> 23:50.663
You should have
listened to me.

23:50.730 --> 23:52.731
Maybe he could've lived.

23:52.798 --> 23:55.433
But now his death
is on your hands.

23:55.500 --> 23:58.570
Your friends
are murders

23:58.637 --> 24:00.439
all because of you.

24:00.506 --> 24:03.409
You're a monster inside.

24:03.476 --> 24:05.411
A bringer of death.

24:05.478 --> 24:06.945
That's all you are.

24:07.012 --> 24:09.214
All you've ever been.

24:09.280 --> 24:11.884
Just... like...

24:11.950 --> 24:13.285
me.

24:13.352 --> 24:17.190
No.

24:17.257 --> 24:22.228
I'm sure
it breaks your heart.

24:22.294 --> 24:23.695
Yes.

24:23.762 --> 24:27.212
I can see that it does.

24:30.368 --> 24:32.304
Good.

25:23.355 --> 25:28.556
With this, you have the
power to rule the world with me.

25:47.814 --> 25:50.382
I understand now.

25:50.449 --> 25:52.618
That's my girl.

25:52.685 --> 25:58.786
We are a family now,
and the world belongs to us.

26:25.617 --> 26:28.287
Should we begin?

26:28.354 --> 26:30.890
Some housekeeping first.

26:30.957 --> 26:32.625
I don't understand.

26:32.692 --> 26:34.926
That's the problem.

26:34.993 --> 26:37.630
You never did.

26:44.903 --> 26:47.003
Now, we begin.

28:05.584 --> 28:06.584
Rach.

28:07.720 --> 28:10.088
You're still you.

28:10.155 --> 28:12.526
<i>Come back to me.</i>

28:12.592 --> 28:15.928
I know you're still
in there, Rach. Please.

28:15.994 --> 28:18.531
<i>Come back to us.</i>

28:18.597 --> 28:22.097
You've gotta fight it, Rach.
Please don't give in.

28:32.045 --> 28:34.513
We've gotta stop
your father.

28:34.580 --> 28:37.817
I need to
get Dick back first.

28:37.884 --> 28:39.451
You reached me.

28:39.519 --> 28:42.388
There has to be
a way to reach him.

28:42.454 --> 28:44.557
I think maybe
we're past that.

28:44.624 --> 28:49.528
No. This started with a
dream I had about him.

28:49.595 --> 28:52.198
Before all this.

28:52.265 --> 28:54.534
I was supposed to find him.

28:54.601 --> 28:57.836
That's what the dream
was telling me.

28:57.903 --> 29:01.574
My dream was the key.

29:01.640 --> 29:02.775
It's all in the dreams.

29:02.842 --> 29:04.042
Rach, no.

29:13.185 --> 29:16.336
What happened to you?

29:19.357 --> 29:20.708
Remember.

29:25.131 --> 29:27.866
Dick.

29:27.933 --> 29:30.603
It's me.

29:30.669 --> 29:32.038
What's with the new look?

29:32.105 --> 29:34.773
I could ask you
the same question.

29:34.839 --> 29:36.108
What are you doin' here?

29:36.174 --> 29:37.910
I came here to save you.

29:40.512 --> 29:43.615
Do I look like
I need saving?

29:43.682 --> 29:46.251
Yes, you do.

29:46.318 --> 29:50.756
What just happened,
what you just did,

29:50.823 --> 29:53.526
it was all planned
by Trigon.

29:53.593 --> 29:56.162
He's been pulling the strings
the entire time.

29:56.229 --> 29:59.898
Dick, you would never
kill Batman.

29:59.965 --> 30:02.434
Are you kidding?

30:02.501 --> 30:07.440
I've been dreaming about this
since I was 12 years old.

30:07.507 --> 30:10.108
My only regret
is waiting for so long.

30:10.175 --> 30:15.048
You taught me how to let
go of the darkness.

30:15.114 --> 30:17.083
You have to let it go, too.

30:17.150 --> 30:19.085
I have a better idea.

30:19.152 --> 30:23.056
Shut your fucking mouth!

30:23.122 --> 30:25.924
This isn't you.

30:25.991 --> 30:27.727
I had a dream about you.

30:27.792 --> 30:30.796
What dream?

30:30.863 --> 30:32.964
I saw you at the circus.

30:33.031 --> 30:34.901
The boy from the circus.

30:34.967 --> 30:38.171
That's how I found you.

30:38.238 --> 30:42.075
We're supposed
to save each other.

30:44.876 --> 30:46.579
I'm sorry, Rachel.

30:46.645 --> 30:50.695
You caught me
on a bad day.

31:03.262 --> 31:05.964
I'm coming to you.

31:06.031 --> 31:11.031
But if I die here,
I die for real.

31:13.373 --> 31:17.722
Is that what
you really want?

32:27.012 --> 32:28.280
I missed you.

32:28.347 --> 32:30.682
Rachel.

32:30.749 --> 32:33.585
Welcome back.

32:37.190 --> 32:38.423
What happened?

32:38.490 --> 32:40.794
Dick can fill you in.

32:40.861 --> 32:43.661
I think I need a minute
alone with my father.

32:58.344 --> 32:59.993
Stay there.

33:08.921 --> 33:11.089
Father!

33:11.156 --> 33:13.525
My child.

33:13.592 --> 33:15.728
Join me.

33:15.794 --> 33:19.565
I would, but, you know...

33:19.631 --> 33:23.269
stuff to do.

33:23.336 --> 33:25.570
I did want to
thank you, though.

33:25.637 --> 33:27.307
For what?

33:27.373 --> 33:30.477
For showing me
who my family really is.

33:30.542 --> 33:32.944
This isn't the time
to get sentimental.

33:34.380 --> 33:36.449
I wouldn't worry.

33:36.516 --> 33:38.683
I know how to
look after myself.

33:38.750 --> 33:40.885
Always have.

33:40.952 --> 33:43.756
You know what they say...

33:43.823 --> 33:46.823
genetics is destiny.

35:05.871 --> 35:09.074
You okay?

35:09.141 --> 35:10.141
Yeah.

35:10.208 --> 35:13.512
Yeah. I think so.

35:13.579 --> 35:15.980
- You?
- I am now.

35:24.090 --> 35:26.403
Clearly, this has been
some kind of major disturbance.

35:26.427 --> 35:28.795
- Can you tell us what happened?
- We can't say for sure.

35:28.862 --> 35:31.073
All we know is that whatever
the cause of the phenomenon,

35:31.097 --> 35:34.101
it appears to have been abated by
this new group of masked heroes.

35:34.166 --> 35:37.103
So, apart from some dead
birds, we seem to have...

35:37.168 --> 35:41.407
Titans are back, bitches!
Whoo!

35:41.474 --> 35:43.443
You're kind of an asshole,
aren't you, kid?

35:43.509 --> 35:46.010
Yeah, but you like me.
Admit it.

35:46.077 --> 35:48.927
Never gonna happen.

35:54.054 --> 35:57.456
I gotta give it to you, Rach, you
really know how to throw a party.

35:57.523 --> 35:59.059
Yeah. Do it again.

35:59.126 --> 36:01.393
- Love beating Dick's ass.
- Keep dreaming, bird boy.

36:01.460 --> 36:02.661
Nice one. Really inventive.

36:02.728 --> 36:04.498
I'll be here all week.

36:04.565 --> 36:07.733
Maybe give us a heads-up next time
so I can do my own eye makeup.

36:07.800 --> 36:10.268
Your demon dad wasn't
much for subtlety.

36:10.335 --> 36:11.670
Really?
I kinda liked it.

36:11.737 --> 36:13.204
It was really
gothic, you know?

36:13.271 --> 36:14.574
Uh... I didn't.

36:14.641 --> 36:17.076
Hey, man, again...

36:17.143 --> 36:18.478
we're really sorry.

36:18.543 --> 36:19.846
No, it's cool.

36:19.913 --> 36:22.347
Hey, I know it wasn't
really you guys.

36:22.414 --> 36:23.949
It couldn't have been.

36:24.016 --> 36:27.552
Dick was actually kinda funny,
in a weird, psycho way.

36:27.619 --> 36:30.623
You do realize I'm listening.

36:30.690 --> 36:32.625
You guys have fun.

36:32.692 --> 36:35.661
- Where are you goin'?
- Um...

36:35.728 --> 36:37.728
Where are we going?

36:37.795 --> 36:39.197
Uh...

36:39.264 --> 36:42.934
I don't know.
It's a mystery.

36:43.001 --> 36:44.070
It's a mystery.

36:44.135 --> 36:45.304
Annoying.

36:45.371 --> 36:49.442
Some things never change.

36:49.509 --> 36:51.376
So, you caught
the road bug, huh?

36:51.443 --> 36:53.445
What, bad coffee
and greasy food?

36:53.512 --> 36:55.181
What's not to love?

36:55.248 --> 36:56.583
It's nice you're
taking the kids.

36:56.648 --> 36:58.351
- Yeah, you think so?
- Mmm-hmm.

36:58.418 --> 37:01.487
Yeah. Yeah,
you're good with them.

37:01.554 --> 37:03.322
So are you.

37:03.389 --> 37:05.090
And this model seats five.

37:05.157 --> 37:08.728
So not for me right now.

37:08.795 --> 37:12.766
I suppose I should figure out
my next move.

37:12.831 --> 37:15.268
- Any thoughts?
- Mmm...

37:15.333 --> 37:19.070
Yeah. Maybe a few.

37:19.137 --> 37:20.972
Ah. A mystery.

37:22.275 --> 37:25.244
Yeah. Well, I'll let you know
when I decide.

37:25.311 --> 37:27.679
Another mystery?

37:27.746 --> 37:30.016
Get used to it.
Life's a lot better with them.

37:30.083 --> 37:33.385
That sounds like something
Batman would say.

37:33.452 --> 37:35.588
Uh, do we get to
meet him this time?

37:35.655 --> 37:37.856
Uh, no. Superman.

37:37.923 --> 37:39.559
- Seriously?
- No. Get in the car.

37:41.795 --> 37:42.895
Shotgun!

37:42.896 --> 37:45.530
- Hey, seriously?
- Hey!

37:45.597 --> 37:48.902
Bye, guys.
I'll miss you.

37:48.969 --> 37:50.702
- Bye, Kory.
- Miss you more.

37:50.769 --> 37:52.304
Send me a postcard
from your planet.

37:52.371 --> 37:54.621
Will do.

37:58.710 --> 38:00.378
You sure it's cool if
we take your ride?

38:00.445 --> 38:02.380
Never use it in the city,
anyway.

38:02.447 --> 38:05.585
You guys need it
more than I do.

38:05.652 --> 38:07.820
Well, guys, take care.

38:07.887 --> 38:11.791
Hey, I mean this
in the best possible way.

38:11.858 --> 38:13.427
It's really been fun,

38:13.494 --> 38:16.094
but let's not meet like this
again for a while, huh?

38:16.161 --> 38:19.063
Hear, hear.

38:19.130 --> 38:22.534
It's a deal.

38:22.601 --> 38:23.999
I'm kidding.

38:24.000 --> 38:25.604
He's an asshole.
He did that on purpose.

38:25.605 --> 38:27.306
Good luck.

38:30.309 --> 38:34.659
- Bye.
- See ya.

40:04.403 --> 40:06.271
I found that foreign tea
you asked me about.

40:06.338 --> 40:08.175
Had to go on the Internet.

40:08.240 --> 40:09.684
<i>We can't say for sure.
All we know is that whatever...</i>

40:09.708 --> 40:11.811
It's around here somewhere.

40:11.878 --> 40:14.555
<i>...it appears to have been abated
by this new group of masked heroes.</i>

40:14.579 --> 40:16.081
<i>So, apart from
some dead birds,</i>

40:16.148 --> 40:17.851
<i>we seem to have escaped
any significant...</i>

40:17.916 --> 40:20.387
<i>Titans are back, bitches!
Whoo!</i>

40:20.454 --> 40:22.654
<i>I'm sorry, you were
saying, "Any significant..."</i>

40:22.655 --> 40:24.189
<i>Right.
Any significant damage.</i>

40:24.190 --> 40:25.624
<i>So, while we're still trying
to find out...</i>

40:25.625 --> 40:28.195
"Chinese chrysanthemum tea"?

40:28.260 --> 40:33.260
Seriously, why do you
hate America?

40:45.878 --> 40:48.581
I have had inquiries.

40:48.648 --> 40:50.817
Mmm-hmm.

40:50.884 --> 40:53.552
There's been
interest in your services.

40:53.619 --> 40:56.168
I'm sure.

40:59.324 --> 41:02.594
The letters I sent?

41:02.661 --> 41:05.532
I read 'em.

41:05.599 --> 41:10.302
I guess you put down the wrong
address when you mailed me back.

41:10.369 --> 41:13.369
Something like that.

41:34.027 --> 41:36.128
- I got this.
- No. No.

41:36.195 --> 41:38.295
It's my house.

41:48.340 --> 41:53.340
<i>System unlocked.</i>

42:08.527 --> 42:13.065
Dry cleaners were asking too
many questions about the blood.

42:13.132 --> 42:17.333
Got it off the best I could.

42:22.242 --> 42:26.092
Little baking soda-lemon
juice combo did the trick.

42:30.416 --> 42:34.920
How about it, old man?

42:34.987 --> 42:38.588
Are we back in business?

43:01.280 --> 43:05.684
Hmm.

43:34.347 --> 43:37.150
I hadn't heard
from you for a while.

43:37.217 --> 43:39.518
When Alfred mentioned
you wished to stop by,

43:39.585 --> 43:41.753
I'll admit, I was surprised.

43:41.820 --> 43:43.889
It's not like you, Bruce,
to be surprised.

43:43.956 --> 43:48.561
True. I try not to
make it a habit.

43:48.628 --> 43:50.096
I see you made the news

43:50.163 --> 43:52.498
with your old Titans friends.

43:52.565 --> 43:54.432
And some new ones, too.

43:54.500 --> 43:56.367
You've been very busy.

43:56.434 --> 43:57.905
I have.

43:57.972 --> 44:00.739
But that's not the
reason you've come to see me.

44:00.806 --> 44:02.509
No.

44:02.576 --> 44:05.876
I never got the chance to
talk to you about why I left.

44:09.248 --> 44:12.284
It wasn't exactly
on great terms.

44:12.351 --> 44:17.189
In my experience, when
people part, it rarely is.

44:17.190 --> 44:18.691
I don't wanna make
a big thing out of this.

44:18.692 --> 44:23.692
I just wanna say a few things
to clear the air.

44:29.568 --> 44:33.239
After I left,
when I moved to Detroit,

44:33.306 --> 44:36.876
part of me
was still back here...

44:36.943 --> 44:41.943
still trying to make sense
about what happened, as a kid.

44:42.047 --> 44:44.050
I struggled.

44:44.117 --> 44:45.885
There was this darkness
inside of me,

44:45.952 --> 44:48.487
and I didn't know
what to do with it.

44:48.554 --> 44:51.056
It hurt me.

44:51.123 --> 44:52.860
And I hurt others.

44:52.925 --> 44:55.927
The whole time, I thought it was
because of the way you raised me,

44:55.994 --> 44:59.032
the way you weaponized
my childhood.

44:59.097 --> 45:02.202
That's one way
of putting it.

45:02.268 --> 45:07.372
Point is, I blamed you for a lot of things
that may or may not have been your fault.

45:07.373 --> 45:09.309
I see.

45:09.376 --> 45:11.244
So you've decided
which one it is now,

45:11.311 --> 45:14.547
and you've come
to render a verdict.

45:14.612 --> 45:16.782
No.

45:16.849 --> 45:18.918
It doesn't matter anymore,

45:18.985 --> 45:21.454
the why or how.

45:21.521 --> 45:23.021
I know you only did
what you knew,

45:23.088 --> 45:25.490
what you thought
was best for me.

45:25.557 --> 45:27.760
The training...

45:27.827 --> 45:29.476
everything.

45:32.965 --> 45:35.433
You only did it so I would
focus on something other than

45:35.434 --> 45:38.605
being angry and sad about
what happened to my parents.

45:40.773 --> 45:42.909
And this, uh...

45:42.974 --> 45:46.045
This darkness
you mentioned...

45:46.112 --> 45:49.048
I had to let it go
in order to move on.

45:49.115 --> 45:53.615
It was stopping me from realizing all
the things you did that helped me.

45:54.820 --> 45:59.820
I'd be curious to know what
you think those things are.

46:02.161 --> 46:05.463
Maybe another time.

46:05.530 --> 46:07.733
Cryptic.

46:07.800 --> 46:10.036
Well done.

46:10.103 --> 46:13.838
I learned from the best.

46:13.905 --> 46:16.742
Well, I appreciate
you coming by.

46:16.809 --> 46:20.079
Things haven't been the same
since you left.

46:20.146 --> 46:21.748
You mean with Jason Todd?

46:21.815 --> 46:24.617
Yeah, he's shown great
promise, as you know.

46:24.684 --> 46:27.853
Though there are some rough edges
that could use sanding down.

46:27.920 --> 46:30.489
Seems right up your alley.

46:30.556 --> 46:32.390
Well, perhaps
after this conversation,

46:32.391 --> 46:34.827
I'll take an
entirely new approach.

46:36.094 --> 46:38.130
I'll believe it
when I see it.

46:38.197 --> 46:41.432
Fair enough.
Old dogs, et cetera.

46:42.635 --> 46:46.235
And you, any new tricks?

46:47.739 --> 46:50.842
Maybe.

46:52.311 --> 46:56.114
If there's anything you need,
you let me know.

46:56.181 --> 47:00.382
Well, as a matter of fact,
there is.

47:03.422 --> 47:06.422
I've been thinkin'
about San Francisco.

47:08.494 --> 47:11.998
Titans again.

47:12.065 --> 47:16.565
Maybe it's time
for a do-over.

47:19.000 --> 47:23.677
On one condition.

47:23.744 --> 47:25.545
It's not
a demotion, per se.

47:25.612 --> 47:27.414
More like
a temporary relocation.

47:27.480 --> 47:30.083
Ugh. Whatever.
Dick, where are we going?

47:30.148 --> 47:31.584
I thought
it was obvious.

47:31.585 --> 47:33.218
I mean, this bridge has been
in a ton of movies.

47:33.219 --> 47:35.221
Yeah, but where exactly?

47:35.288 --> 47:36.422
You'll see.

47:36.489 --> 47:37.757
God, I hate surprises.

48:04.849 --> 48:06.018
Oh...

49:27.300 --> 49:28.835
You gotta be
fucking kidding me.

50:05.170 --> 50:08.673
What is this place?

50:08.740 --> 50:12.110
Home.

50:29.663 --> 50:30.896
I get the big room.

50:30.963 --> 50:34.413
Keep dreamin'.
