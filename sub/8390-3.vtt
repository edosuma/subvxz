THAT'S WHAT MY DAD USED TO DO.
YOU LIKE CAR RIDES?

09:11.130 --> 09:12.199
- CAN I TAKE THE BOARD?

09:12.240 --> 09:13.502
- OH, COULD YOU?

09:13.550 --> 09:15.859
OKAY, WELL, WHAT IF I DON'T WANT
YOU TO DO THAT FOR ME, HUH?

09:15.900 --> 09:20.348
- SO WAS THIS A FISH BOWL
OR AN ACT UAL--

09:20.380 --> 09:21.586
- IT WAS A TAN K.
- YEAH.

09:21.630 --> 09:23.621
- TANK.
- PRETI'Y SIZEABLE TANK.

09:23.660 --> 09:26.174
- WERE THERE ANY...?

09:26.220 --> 09:28.859
- SURVIVORS? NO.

09:28.910 --> 09:30.901
- WELL, SULLIVAN'S RECOMMENDING
YOU CHANGE MAX'S PLACEMENT.

09:30.940 --> 09:33.420
- IF THAT MEANS THAT THEY
KICKED HIM OUT OF THE SCHOOL,

09:33.460 --> 09:34.563
THEN, YES.

09:34.600 --> 09:35.806
- WE'VE LOOKED
INTO A FEW SCHOOLS.

09:35.850 --> 09:38.182
THE ONE THAT EVERYBODY KEEPS
TELLING US ABOUT

09:38.230 --> 09:39.913
IS FOOTPATH ELEMENTARY.
- FOOTPATH, YEAH.

09:39.950 --> 09:41.053
YEAH, THAT WOULD BE BEST,

09:41.090 --> 09:42.739
AND IT WOULD BE A GOOD FIT
FOR MAX.

09:42.780 --> 09:46.739
HOWEVER, IT IS VERY HARD
TO GET INTO.

09:46.790 --> 09:48.712
IT IS QUITE EXPENSIVE.
- HOW EXPENSIVE?

09:48.760 --> 09:50.546
- YOU KNOW HOW MUCH
PRIVATE SCHOOL COSTS--

09:50.590 --> 09:53.161
DOUBLE THAT.
- DOESN'T MA'I'I'ER, OKAY?

09:53.210 --> 09:55.610
- OKAY. WELL,
YOU WOULD NEED TO CONTACT

09:55.660 --> 09:57.002
DR. ROBERTSON IN ADMISSIONS.

09:57.040 --> 09:59.076
- WE HAVE CALLED HER.
- SEVERAL TIMES.

09:59.110 --> 10:00.270
- RADIO SILENCE.

10:00.320 --> 10:01.594
- I'M SURE THAT SHE'LL GET
BACK TO YOU WITHIN THE WEEK.

10:01.630 --> 10:04.838
- LOOK, DR. PELICAN, MY SON MAX
DOESN'T HAVE A SCHOOL TO GO TO.

10:04.880 --> 10:07.667
WHAT AM I SUPPOSED
TO TELL HIM?

10:07.710 --> 10:09.974
- YOU KNOW, WHAT IF YOU
CALLED HER ON OUR BEHALF?

10:10.020 --> 10:12.602
- PLEASE.
LOOK, DON'T MAKE US COME

10:12.640 --> 10:14.289
AND SIT IN YOUR WAITING ROOM
ON A DAILY BASIS.

10:14.330 --> 10:17.640
- 'CAUSE WE'LL DO IT.
WE WILL.

10:19.820 --> 10:22.926
- CAN YOU TAKE ME HOME NOW?

10:22.960 --> 10:25.781
- HUH?
- CAN YOU TAKE ME HOME NOW?

10:25.830 --> 10:26.922
- ARE YOU KIDDING, BUDDY?

10:26.970 --> 10:29.996
WE GOT TWO AND A HALF HOURS
OF BONDING TIME LEFI'.

10:30.900 --> 10:31.719
WHAT DO YOU THINK
OF THESE STREETS?

10:31.760 --> 10:33.387
THEY'RE LIKE
ROLLER COASTERS, RIGHT?

10:34.770 --> 10:36.761
ARE YOU ALL RIGHT, BUDDY?

10:36.800 --> 10:39.280
- NOW I REMEMBER
WHY MY MOM SAYS

10:39.320 --> 10:41.185
THAT I CAN'T EAT CHOCOLATE.

10:41.220 --> 10:42.562
I'M INTOLERANT.

10:42.600 --> 10:43.942
- YOU'RE WHAT?

10:45.090 --> 10:47.672
- [vomits]

10:47.710 --> 10:51.817
- AHH!
- LACTOSE.

10:51.850 --> 10:54.546
- YEAH, YEP.
I SEE THAT.

10:54.580 --> 10:57.993
AW, COME ON.

11:04.870 --> 11:07.134
- QUESTION.
- YES, COUNSELOR?

11:08.250 --> 11:08.796
- ARE WE A LITTLE CONCERNED
THAT SYDNEY HAS HAD

11:08.840 --> 11:09.761
FIVE SWIM LESSONS NOW--

11:09.800 --> 11:11.859
ALL SHE CAN DO IS
THE BLUB BLUB BLUB...

11:11.910 --> 11:13.491
- UH, WE ARE NOT CONCERNED.

11:13.530 --> 11:15.009
I KNOW YOU WERE
ON THE SWIM TEAM,

11:15.050 --> 11:17.018
AND YOU WERE
REALLY, REALLY GOOD.

11:17.050 --> 11:19.189
- I WAS NOT JUST
REALLY, REALLY GOOD.

11:19.230 --> 11:20.390
I WAS ALL-C.I.F.

11:20.430 --> 11:22.534
- OH, OKAY.

11:22.570 --> 11:23.707
- WELL...
- MOMMY, COME SEE.

11:23.750 --> 11:26.469
- GOD, BRAVERMANS ARE
SO COCKY.

11:26.510 --> 11:28.649
- HEY.

11:28.680 --> 11:30.500
- MOMMY, LOOK.

11:30.550 --> 11:32.859
[blowing bubbles]

11:32.890 --> 11:34.710
I'M SWIMMING.

11:34.760 --> 11:36.853
- THAT'S NOT SWIMMING, BABY.

11:36.900 --> 11:39.300
DON'T LET ANYBODY TELL YOU
THAT THAT'S SWIMMING.

11:39.350 --> 11:40.829
WHAT IS THIS?

11:40.870 --> 11:43.338
- JUST LIKE RACQUEL'S.

11:43.390 --> 11:44.869
IT MEANS ABUNDANCE.

11:44.910 --> 11:46.969
- I KNOW WHAT IT MEANS.

11:47.010 --> 11:49.763
OKAY...

11:49.810 --> 11:51.209
- SWIM TIME'S OVER.

11:51.260 --> 11:54.912
[knock on door]

11:54.950 --> 11:56.531
- YOU'VE DEALT
WITH KID PUKE BEFORE, RIGHT?

11:56.570 --> 11:57.810
- UH-HUH.

11:59.370 --> 12:01.258
- WHEW!

12:01.300 --> 12:03.860
I DON'T KNOW HOW YOU DO IT, MAN.
- DO WHAT?

12:03.890 --> 12:05.505
- THIS KID THING--
IT'S STRESSING ME OUT.

12:05.550 --> 12:08.098
- COME ON, MAN, YOU HAD JABBAR
FOR WHAT, HALF A DAY?

12:08.140 --> 12:10.961
- YOU KNOW, WHATEVER.
YOU HAD A LITTLE WARM-UP.

12:11.000 --> 12:13.935
YOU KNOW, YOU GOT TO SEE
YOUR BUN BAKE IN THE OVEN.

12:13.970 --> 12:16.347
MY KID CAME OUT TALKING
AND WALKING--

12:16.390 --> 12:19.416
A THREE-FOOT-TALL
LI'I'I'LE CANDYLAND MASTER.

12:19.460 --> 12:21.007
- WELL, GIVE IT TIME.

12:21.050 --> 12:23.075
- THAT'S EASY
FOR YOU TO SAY.

12:25.600 --> 12:26.828
- YOU KNOW WHAT, CROSBY?

12:26.880 --> 12:29.223
HOWEVER HARD YOU THINK IT IS
HAVING A KID, JUST DOUBLE IT.

12:30.850 --> 12:32.397
- YEAH, WELL,
HE'S COMING OVER AGAIN,

12:32.440 --> 12:33.577
AND I HAVE TO WORK.

12:33.610 --> 12:35.840
WHAT, AM I SUPPOSED
TO BRING HIM TO THE STUDIO?

12:35.890 --> 12:37.858
I CAN'T HANDLE THIS.
- YOU WANT US TO WATCH HIM?

12:37.890 --> 12:39.118
- SERIOUSLY?

12:39.170 --> 12:41.752
- NO, JACKASS, HE'S YOUR SON.
GROW A PAIR.

12:41.790 --> 12:43.200
DEAL WITH IT.

12:43.240 --> 12:45.299
- UH, I WASN'T GONNA TAKE YOU UP
ON IT ANWVAYS.

12:45.350 --> 12:46.829
- OH, OKAY.

12:49.900 --> 12:53.973
- WHAT MAKES ALL THIS
WORTH IT?

12:57.290 --> 13:00.145
- WHAT MAKES IT WORTH IT
IS THE CONNECTION.

13:01.880 --> 13:04.701
IT'S THE BOND YOU FEEL.

13:04.740 --> 13:08.779
THEY'RE YOURS,
YOU KNOW, AND...

13:08.820 --> 13:11.027
YOU'RE PART OF THEM.

13:14.000 --> 13:16.992
- WELL, WHAT IF I DON'T FEEL
A CONNECTION,

13:17.030 --> 13:20.340
YOU KNOW, ANY--ANY MORE
THAN YOU'D FEEL TO ANY KID?

13:20.380 --> 13:21.995
- YOU WILL.

13:26.840 --> 13:29.934
- [sighs deeply]

13:29.980 --> 13:32.039
- [sniffs]
I THINK IT'S BE'I'I'ER.

13:32.080 --> 13:36.210
- [sniffs]
OH, MAN! UGH!

13:36.260 --> 13:39.297
NOT EVEN CLOSE, MY FRIEND.
I'LL SEE YOU INSIDE.

13:39.330 --> 13:41.013
- WHAT, ARE YOU
JUST LEAVING ME HERE?

13:41.060 --> 13:43.949
- YEP. GOOD NIGHT.
- HEY, WE'RE NOT DONE HERE.

14:02.460 --> 14:03.484
- OW.

14:06.740 --> 14:08.560
OW!

14:08.600 --> 14:11.728
SHH, SHH, SHH.

14:11.780 --> 14:14.988
AAH! OW!

14:27.340 --> 14:28.784
HONEY!
- OY!

14:28.830 --> 14:31.651
WATCH IT!
- I HAVE TO SLEEP.

14:31.690 --> 14:33.578
- I'M TRYING TO SLEEP HERE.
WHAT'S WRONG WITH YOU?

14:33.630 --> 14:35.621
- I'M SO TIRED.
- COME ON, GIVE ME A BREAK.

14:35.660 --> 14:36.797
- GIVE ME A BREAK.

14:36.840 --> 14:40.355
GIVE ME ONE LI'ITLE BREAK
SO THAT I CAN GET SOME SLEEP.

14:40.390 --> 14:42.255
- CAN YOU JUST MOVE OVER
A LITTLE BIT?

14:42.290 --> 14:43.973
I CAN'T DO THIS.
I NEED MY SPACE!

14:44.020 --> 14:45.590
- I CAN'T DO IT
ANYMORE EITHER!

14:45.640 --> 14:48.086
- CAN YOU PLEASE REMIND ME
WHY LITTLE, TINY DREW

14:48.120 --> 14:49.360
GETS HIS OWN ROOM?
- DREW'S A BOY.

14:49.400 --> 14:50.742
DO YOU WANT TO SHARE A ROOM
WITH DREW?

14:50.780 --> 14:52.008
- NOT REALLY, BUT, YOU KNOW,

14:52.060 --> 14:52.981
I'M NOT REALLY
LOVING THIS EITHER.

14:53.030 --> 14:54.986
NO OFFENSE.
- I'M NOT LOVING IT EITHER.

14:55.030 --> 14:56.986
- WHATEVER. TOMORROW
I'M ASKING GRANDPA IF I CAN--

14:57.030 --> 14:58.952
- YOU'RE NOT ASKING GRANDPA.
- WHY? WHY NOT?

14:59.000 --> 15:00.479
HE DOESN'T NEED IT BACK THERE.
HE'S RETIRED.

15:00.520 --> 15:01.964
- OH, GOD, I'M SO TIRED.
- WHAT'S WRONG WITH YOU, MOM?

15:02.000 --> 15:03.308
- NOTHING IS WRONG WITH YOU.

15:03.350 --> 15:04.681
- WHY ARE YOU BEING
SUCH A WEENIE ABOUT THIS?

15:04.730 --> 15:05.992
THAT'S HIS PRIVATE SPACE.
I'M NOT BEING A WEENIE.

15:06.040 --> 15:07.484
- EVERY TIME I BRING UP GRANDPA,

15:07.520 --> 15:08.999
YOU GET ALL, LIKE, WEENIE,
AND YOU'RE USUALLY SO BALLSY.

15:09.040 --> 15:11.452
WHAT'S GOING ON?

15:11.490 --> 15:14.311
- THAT'S MEAN.

15:14.360 --> 15:16.499
THAT'S NOT TRUE.

15:20.810 --> 15:22.459
- GOT A MINUTE?

15:22.500 --> 15:24.536
- FOR MY LITTLE SISTER,
I DO, YEAH.

15:24.570 --> 15:26.151
- GREAT. YOU WANT TO GO
TO BERKELEY COFFEE?

15:26.200 --> 15:27.462
THEY LOVE ME OVER THERE.

15:27.510 --> 15:29.603
EVER SINCE I HOOKED JIM UP WITH
SARAH, IT'S LIKE, FREE BISCOTTI

15:30.890 --> 15:33.097
- UH-HUH, IT LOOKS LIKE MAYBE
YOU'VE HAD A FEW TOO MANY.

15:33.130 --> 15:34.404
- WELL...
- I WOULD LOVE TO GO.

15:34.450 --> 15:36.714
BUT I HAVE TO GET OUT
OF HERE EARLY TODAY.

15:36.760 --> 15:39.752
SO IS IT OKAY IF WE JUST TALK
WHILE I ANSWER SOME EMAILS,

15:39.800 --> 15:41.062
AND I KIND OF HALF-LISTEN
TO YOU?

15:41.110 --> 15:42.134
- YEAH, THAT'LL WORK.
- OKAY.

15:42.180 --> 15:44.319
- OKAY, SO...
[sighs]

15:44.350 --> 15:45.419
- WHAT'S UP?

15:45.460 --> 15:47.837
- JOEL HAS SYDNEY
IN THIS ZEN SWIMMING CLASS,

15:47.870 --> 15:49.144
WHICH IS BASICALLY A JOKE.
- RIGHT.

15:49.180 --> 15:50.624
- AND THEN THERE'S RACQUEL,
WHICH IS JUST--

15:50.670 --> 15:52.217
- WAIT, RACQUEL THE HOT ONE?

15:52.260 --> 15:54.148
- IS SHE HOT?
I HADN'T NOTICED.

15:54.190 --> 15:55.259
DO YOU REMEMBER WHAT
A GREAT SWIMMER I WAS?

15:55.290 --> 15:56.427
- YEAH, YOU WERE ALL-C.I.F.

15:56.470 --> 15:57.676
- I WAS. THANK YOU!
GOSH, THAT--

15:57.710 --> 15:59.530
THAT MEANS A LOT TO ME
THAT YOU REMEMBER THAT.

15:59.570 --> 16:01.128
- YOU'RE WELCOME.

16:01.160 --> 16:02.331
- OKAY, ANWVAY,
I DON'T GET A SAY

16:02.370 --> 16:04.577
IN HOW MY DAUGHTER'S LEARNING
HOW TO SWIM.

16:04.610 --> 16:06.054
ME, ALL-C.I.F....

16:06.100 --> 16:07.954
- 'CAUSE YOU HAVE TO WORK.
- BECAUSE I HAVE TO WORK.

16:08.000 --> 16:09.444
- JULIA, LISTEN TO ME.
YOU DON'T HAVE TO CHOOSE

16:09.480 --> 16:12.165
BETWEEN BEING A MOM
AND HAVING TO WORK.

16:12.210 --> 16:13.370
OKAY?
- YEAH.

16:13.420 --> 16:14.546
- YOU MAY NOT BE THERE
ALL THE TIME,

16:14.590 --> 16:16.103
BUT THE TIME THAT YOU DO HAVE,
YOU CAN MAKE IT COUNT.

16:16.140 --> 16:17.175
SHE'S YOUR DAUGHTER.

16:17.210 --> 16:18.245
TEACH HER HOW TO SWIM.

16:18.280 --> 16:20.487
SHE'LL REMEMBER THAT
FOR THE REST OF HER LIFE.

16:23.150 --> 16:24.458
- YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT.
- WELL...

16:24.500 --> 16:27.355
- YOU'RE THE BEST.
OH, MY GOD.

16:27.400 --> 16:28.901
OH, MWAH. OKAY.

16:28.950 --> 16:30.281
- I'LL SEE YOU LATER.
- OKAY, BYE.

16:30.330 --> 16:31.774
NO, SORRY, WAIT.
- WHAT?

16:31.810 --> 16:33.744
- I HAVE SOMETHING FOR YOU.
IT'S FROM RACQUEL.

16:33.780 --> 16:35.429
- WHAT?
- YEAH.

16:35.470 --> 16:38.598
IT'S A TIBETAN PRAYER STONE.
- WELL, THAT'S--THAT'S WEIRD.

16:38.650 --> 16:41.118
- FOR COMFORT AND GOOD LUCK...
- OKAY.

16:41.170 --> 16:42.649
- WITH MAX.

16:42.690 --> 16:45.614
- RIGHT.
OKAY, WELL, UH...

16:45.650 --> 16:47.129
THANK HER FOR ME.

16:47.170 --> 16:48.489
- YEAH, IF I MUST.
- ALL RIGHT.

16:48.520 --> 16:50.101
TEACH THAT GIRIESI-IIOW TO SWIM.

16:50.140 --> 16:51.311
- WHO'S A BETTER TEACHER
THAN YOU?

16:51.350 --> 16:52.578
- NO ONE.
- NO ONE.

16:54.220 --> 16:56.142
[door closes]
SEE YA.

17:06.330 --> 17:08.503
- GOD.

17:08.540 --> 17:10.326
AAH!
-AAH!

17:10.370 --> 17:14.363
[laughing]

17:14.410 --> 17:16.742
WHAT ARE YOU DOING
BACK HERE?

17:16.790 --> 17:18.234
- NOTHING. I JUST--

17:18.270 --> 17:21.478
I WAS JUST TAKING A MINUTE.

17:21.520 --> 17:23.169
- EVERYTHING OKAY?

17:23.210 --> 17:25.064
- YEAH.
I'LL SEE YOU IN THERE.

17:26.250 --> 17:28.696
- OH, GUESS WHO CALLED.
- HMM?

17:28.730 --> 17:30.595
- JIM KAZINSKI.

17:30.630 --> 17:32.973
I FORGOT HOW FUNNY HE IS.
- YEAH.

17:33.010 --> 17:34.181
- DO YOU REMEMBER HIS UNCLE--

17:34.220 --> 17:35.562
THE ONE WHO MARRIED
THE TRANSSEXUAL?

17:35.600 --> 17:37.352
THEY'RE STILL TOGETHER.
DO YOU BELIEVE IT?

17:37.400 --> 17:40.039
I MEAN, TALK
ABOUT BUCKING THE ODDS.

17:40.090 --> 17:41.637
- HOW LONG DID YOU TALK
TO HIM FOR?

17:41.680 --> 17:43.568
- A WHILE.
- WHY?

17:43.610 --> 17:45.089
- BECAUSE HE CALLED.

17:45.130 --> 17:46.506
- FOR ME.
HE CALLED FOR ME.

17:46.540 --> 17:48.189
AND WE JUST BROKE UP.
YOU KNOW WE JUST BROKE UP.

17:48.230 --> 17:50.642
I MEAN, CAN'T YOU JUST SAY,

17:50.690 --> 17:52.237
"SHE'S NOT HERE,
I'LL TAKE A MESSAGE--

17:52.270 --> 17:53.476
SHE'LL CALL YOU BACK"?

17:53.520 --> 17:55.681
- EXCUSE ME.
I'M NOT GONNA BE RUDE TO HIM.

17:55.720 --> 17:57.278
- YOU TALK ABOUT HIS
TRANSSEXUAL RELATIVES

17:57.310 --> 17:58.447
FOR HALF AN HOUR.

17:58.490 --> 18:00.173
- I LIKE HIM.
I'VE ALWAYS LIKED JIM.

18:00.210 --> 18:01.438
- I KNOW. IF ONLY
I HAD MARRIED JIM

18:01.490 --> 18:03.105
INSTEAD OF THAT MUSICIAN,

18:03.150 --> 18:04.549
HOW DIFFERENTLY MY LIFE...
- I NEVER SAID THAT.

18:04.600 --> 18:05.976
WOULD'VE TURNED OUT.
YOU DIDN'T HAVE TO SAY IT.

18:06.010 --> 18:07.591
- DON'T BE SO OVERSENSITIVE!
- DON'T--

18:12.290 --> 18:15.566
- WELL, LISTEN, UM...

18:15.610 --> 18:18.943
YOUR DAD AND I WANT YOU
TO LET US BUY YOU A NEW CAR.

18:18.990 --> 18:20.958
- NO.
- WELL, NOT A NEW CAR,

18:20.990 --> 18:22.878
OF COURSE,
BUT A USED CAR.

18:22.920 --> 18:24.262
- NO.
- BUT ONE WITH A WARRANTY.

18:24.310 --> 18:26.449
NOT A JUNKYARD CAR.
COME ON, YOU'RE LONG OVERDUE.

18:26.480 --> 18:30.962
- MOM, ISN'T IT BAD ENOUGH...?

18:31.000 --> 18:33.889
I'M LIVING AT HOME.
YOU'RE FEEDING ME.

18:33.940 --> 18:35.931
YOU'RE FEEDING MY KIDS.

18:35.970 --> 18:38.450
YOU MAY NOT BUY ME A CAR.

18:39.910 --> 18:41.593
- OKAY, FINE.

18:46.330 --> 18:48.218
- THIS PLACE IS A LOT BIGGER
THAN I THOUGHT IT WAS.

18:48.260 --> 18:49.249
- IT'S HUGE.

18:49.300 --> 18:52.155
- CHIPPED PAINT OVER THERE
ON THE WALL, HUH?

18:52.200 --> 18:54.395
- YEAH, I DON'T SEE
WHAT ALL THE HOOPLA'S ABOUT.

18:54.440 --> 18:57.546
I MEAN, IT'S KIND OF DIRTY.

18:57.580 --> 18:59.855
- YEAH.

18:59.890 --> 19:02.199
- HONEY?

19:02.240 --> 19:05.414
[children chattering]

19:07.930 --> 19:10.342
[overlapping conversations]

19:23.990 --> 19:28.222
- LOOK, IT WOULD BE TOUGH
TO AFFORD THIS PLACE ANYWAY.

19:28.270 --> 19:29.646
- I KNOW.

19:29.680 --> 19:31.671
WHEN WE WERE READING
ABOUT THE KIDS IN YOUR PROGRAM,

19:31.720 --> 19:33.950
THEY SEEMED SO MUCH LIKE MAX,
IT WAS INCREDIBLE.

19:34.000 --> 19:37.231
- AND THEN WE JUST SAW THIS BOY
DOWN THE HALL IN A CLASSROOM.

19:37.270 --> 19:38.271
HE WAS DRESSED UP
LIKE A SAILOR,

19:38.310 --> 19:40.653
WHICH IS JUST LIKE MAX
WITH HIS PIRATE COSTUME.

19:40.690 --> 19:42.066
- THAT'S KELLEN, KELLEN JAMES.
HE'S A GOOD KID.

19:42.110 --> 19:44.032
- HE IS REALLY CUTE.
- YEAH, HE'S GOOD.

19:44.070 --> 19:46.834
I UNDERSTAND
YOUR ENTHUSIASM.

19:46.870 --> 19:49.179
HOWEVER, WE'VE ALREADY TAKEN IN
ONE NEW CHILD

19:49.220 --> 19:50.426
FOR THE THIRD-GRADE CLASS.

19:50.460 --> 19:52.280
- BUT YOU TOOK--YOU TOOK
A LOOK AT MAX'S FILE,

19:52.320 --> 19:53.423
AND YOU SPOKE WITH DR. PELICAN?
- YES, I DID.

19:53.460 --> 19:56.156
- SO YOU UNDERSTAND
WHAT WE'RE DEALING WITH HERE.

19:56.190 --> 19:57.600
OUR SON MAX IS SOMEWHERE
IN BETWEEN.

19:57.640 --> 20:00.609
HE'S TOO HIGH-FUNCTIONING
FOR A SPECIAL-NEEDS PROGRAM,

20:00.640 --> 20:01.982
BE HE DOESN'T REALLY--
- HE HAS REAL TROUBLE

20:02.020 --> 20:03.840
FITTING
INTO A MAINSTREAM SCHOOL.

20:03.890 --> 20:05.027
HE NEEDS SOME HELP.

20:05.060 --> 20:06.948
SO WHAT DO YOU--WHAT DO YOU DO
WITH A CHILD LIKE THAT?

20:06.990 --> 20:09.163
- WE BRING HIM TO A SCHOOL
LIKE OURS...IN SEPTEMBER.

20:09.200 --> 20:12.476
- I'M SORRY, ARE YOU SAYING
THAT YOU WON'T EVEN SEE HIM?

20:12.520 --> 20:14.169
- WE JUST FEEL LIKE
IF YOU SPEND SOME TIME WITH HIM,

20:14.210 --> 20:16.269
AND YOU--
YOU SAT DOWN WITH HIM,

20:16.310 --> 20:17.823
YOU WOULD SEE WHAT WE DO
AS PARENTS.

20:17.870 --> 20:19.269
I MEAN, HE'S--
THE KID'S INCREDIBLE.

20:19.320 --> 20:20.105
- IF YOU JUST MEET HIM...

20:20.140 --> 20:21.346
- SEE, I DON'T WANT
TO GIVE YOU

20:21.390 --> 20:22.618
A FALSE SENSE OF HOPE,

20:22.660 --> 20:24.309
BECAUSE IT'S REALLY,
REALLY VERY UNLIKELY--

20:24.360 --> 20:26.316
- LISTEN, HE IS
A FANTASTIC KID, DR. ROBERTSON.

20:26.360 --> 20:28.419
I'M NOT JUST SAYING THAT
'CAUSE HE'S MY SON.

20:28.460 --> 20:31.156
- HE'S GREAT.
HE'S FUNNY. HE'S BRIGHT.

20:31.190 --> 20:33.363
HE SAYS THE ODDEST,
MOST HILARIOUS THINGS

20:33.400 --> 20:34.947
I'VE EVER HEARD
IN MY ENTIRE LIFE.

20:34.990 --> 20:37.151
- PLAYS THE HARMONICA
IN A WEIRDLY GOOD WAY.

20:37.200 --> 20:38.337
- HE DOES.
AND HE PLAYS CHESS.

20:38.370 --> 20:39.598
HE DOESN'T REALLY
PLAY CHESS SO MUCH,

20:39.650 --> 20:41.333
BUT HE MAKES UP STORIES WITH
THE LITTLE PIECES ON THE BOARD,

20:41.370 --> 20:42.541
LIKE, "I'M GONNA KICK--
I'M GONNA ATTACK YOU."

20:42.580 --> 20:44.753
- YOU KNOW, WE--WE JUST WANT
YOU TO MEET HIM.

20:44.790 --> 20:47.406
JUST 15 MINUTES OF YOUR TIME,
THAT'S ALL--JUST MEET HIM.

20:47.450 --> 20:49.065
- THAT'S IT.
AND IF YOU SAY NO,

20:49.100 --> 20:51.239
THEN AT LEAST YOU'LL HAVE MADE
AN INFORMED DECISION.

20:51.280 --> 20:54.556
- JUST MEET HIM.
- PLEASE. FIVE MINUTES.

20:54.590 --> 20:57.036
- I'M NOT GONNA PROMISE
ANYTHING, ALL RIGHT?

20:57.080 --> 20:58.729
- BUT YOU'RE GONNA MEET HIM?
THAT'S ALL WE ASK.

20:58.770 --> 21:00.351
- I'M GONNA MEET HIM.
- THANK YOU.

21:00.390 --> 21:02.381
- OKAY, I'M GONNA MEET HIM.
- SHE'S GONNA MEET HIM.

21:02.430 --> 21:04.421
- THANK YOU.
- THANK YOU SO MUCH.

21:04.470 --> 21:06.495
THANK YOU.
- I HAVE TO GET SOME WORK DONE.

21:06.540 --> 21:08.360
- THANK YOU. YOU LOOK
A LITTLE BIT LIKE OPRAH.

21:08.400 --> 21:10.539
- GOOD AFTERNOON. BYE.
BE CAREFUL.

21:10.570 --> 21:12.435
- YOU TAKE CARE.
- TAKE CARE.

21:12.470 --> 21:15.576
- SHOULD I LEAVE IT OPEN?
- PLEASE DO.

21:15.610 --> 21:18.374
- OH-OH OH-OH OH-OH

21:18.410 --> 21:21.538
[mid-tempo music]

21:27.250 --> 21:32.665
OH-OH OH-OH OH-OH

21:44.190 --> 21:46.499
- [mouths words]

21:48.410 --> 21:53.507
- OH-OH OH-OH OH-OH

22:01.380 --> 22:03.587
- MOMMY!
- HI, SWEETIE.

22:03.630 --> 22:04.961
- YOU'RE LIKE A FISH.

22:05.010 --> 22:06.625
- YOU WANT ME TO TEACH YOU
HOW TO SWIM LIKE A FISH?

22:06.670 --> 22:08.979
- YEAH.
- [chuckles]

22:09.010 --> 22:10.420
ALL RIGHT.

22:10.460 --> 22:12.451
- NICE ENTRANCE.
- THANKS.

22:12.500 --> 22:15.151
YOU KNOW HOW GRANDPA ZEKE
TAUGHT ME TO SWIM?

22:15.190 --> 22:19.604
HE DROPPED ME IN THE DEEP END
OF THE POOL WHEN I WAS TWO.

22:19.640 --> 22:23.019
I'M GONNA ASK YOU
TO TRUST ME OKAY?

22:23.060 --> 22:24.539
- [groans]

22:24.580 --> 22:26.616
- ALL RIGHT, SWIM TO ME.

22:26.650 --> 22:29.471
- I DON'T KNOW HOW TO SWIM.

22:29.520 --> 22:30.475
- I SAW YOU KICKING.

22:30.520 --> 22:32.659
THAT'S ALL YOU NEED TO KNOW
HOW TO DO, OKAY?

22:32.690 --> 22:35.727
- I'M SCARED.
- JUST KICK OFF, LET GO,

22:35.760 --> 22:37.557
AND COME HERE.

22:37.590 --> 22:39.581
I'M RIGHT HERE.
- I CAN'T.

22:39.630 --> 22:41.552
- YEAH, YOU CAN, BABE.

22:41.600 --> 22:43.386
WE KNOW YOU CAN. COME ON.
- WE'RE RIGHT HERE.

22:43.430 --> 22:45.250
WE'RE NOT GONNA LET
ANYTHING BAD HAPPEN.

22:45.290 --> 22:47.258
WE'RE RIGHT HERE.
- PROMISE?

22:47.290 --> 22:48.496
- PROMISE. ABSOLUTELY.
- PROMISE.

22:48.530 --> 22:50.009
- YOU GOT IT.
COME ON.

22:52.950 --> 22:54.702
- OKAY, SHE'S GONNA KICK.
SHE'S GONNA KICK.

22:54.750 --> 22:56.570
- SHE'S SINKING
IS WHAT SHE'S DOING.

22:56.610 --> 22:57.838
- WELL, GIVE HER A SECOND.
- COME ON.

22:57.890 --> 22:58.914
- HELP, DADDY! HELP!

22:58.960 --> 23:01.576
- YOU DID IT, BABY!
- DADDY, HELP!

23:01.620 --> 23:06.159
DADDY...
[coughing]

23:06.210 --> 23:07.654
- YOU SWAM!

23:07.690 --> 23:10.033
- YOU "DROWNDED" ME!

23:10.070 --> 23:12.721
[coughing and crying]
- IT'S ALL RIGHT.

23:18.180 --> 23:20.740
- SHE SWAM.

23:27.710 --> 23:31.578
- I LOVE HOW THEY CALL IT
"AUTOMOTIVE RECYCLING."

23:31.610 --> 23:33.089
I MEAN, WHAT'S WRONG
WITH "JUNK"?

23:33.130 --> 23:36.190
JUNK IS AN HONEST WORD.

23:36.240 --> 23:37.025
- LOOK AT THESE, DAD.

23:37.070 --> 23:37.991
SOME OF THESE CARS
HAVE BEEN AROUND

23:38.030 --> 23:40.305
SINCE THE FIRST TIME
YOU BROUGHT ME HERE.

23:40.340 --> 23:41.898
[chuckles] OH, DAD, LOOK
AT THAT--PONTIAC.

23:45.110 --> 23:46.338
- THAT'S A GOOD EYE,

23:46.390 --> 23:49.177
BUT IT LOOKS LIKE
IT'S BEEN STRIPPED.

23:49.220 --> 23:50.938
OH, LOOK AT THIS.

23:50.980 --> 23:52.493
1948 CADILLAC--

23:52.530 --> 23:55.181
NOW, I ALWAYS WANTED ONE
OF THESE.

23:55.220 --> 23:56.869
[pounding]

23:56.910 --> 23:58.286
HUH?
- [laughs]

23:58.330 --> 24:00.798
- THAT'S AMERICAN STEEL
RIGHT THERE.

24:00.850 --> 24:01.703
THE BIG IRON!

24:01.750 --> 24:03.012
- WHAT WOULD YOU THINK, DAD,

24:03.060 --> 24:04.914
IF I MOVED INTO YOUR OFFICE
FOR A LITTLE WHILE?

24:04.960 --> 24:07.337
- WELL, HONEY, WHY THE HELL DO
YOU WANT TO SLEEP BACK THERE?

24:07.370 --> 24:08.644
IT'S ALL MOLDY.
- WELL, MAYBE.

24:08.680 --> 24:10.329
BUT ME AND AMBER
IN THAT LITTLE ROOM--

24:10.370 --> 24:13.646
IT'S KIND OF TIGHT.

24:13.690 --> 24:16.158
- WELL, I WORK BACK THERE,
SWEETHEART.

24:16.210 --> 24:17.962
- RIGHT.
- OH, NOW, HERE YOU GO.

24:18.000 --> 24:20.104
SEE, THIS IS AN ENGINE
YOU CAN WORK ON.

24:20.140 --> 24:22.028
ISN'T THAT BEAUTIFUL?

24:22.080 --> 24:26.699
- DAD, WHY DO YOU HAVE CONDOMS
IN THE OFFICE?

24:32.540 --> 24:35.088
- I DON'T WANT TO TALK
TO YOU ABOUT THAT.

24:41.270 --> 24:43.363
- I'M SO SORRY.
I JUST--

24:43.410 --> 24:44.684
I THOUGHT
THAT I COULD HELP--

24:44.720 --> 24:46.403
- JUST POP IN
AND HAVE EVERYTHING YOUR WAY,

24:46.450 --> 24:47.644
AND THEN POP OUT?

24:50.660 --> 24:52.446
- YOU'RE MAD.

24:52.490 --> 24:54.583
- YOU SHOULD HAVE TOLD ME.

24:57.390 --> 25:00.860
- SHE DID SWIM.
YOU SAW THAT.

25:02.460 --> 25:04.803
- I'LL SEE YOU AT HOME.

25:07.400 --> 25:09.186
- JOEL.

25:09.230 --> 25:11.118
- YEAH?

25:11.160 --> 25:14.084
- I'M SORRY.

25:14.130 --> 25:16.644
- YEAH.

25:19.270 --> 25:21.830
HEY, SUGAR.

25:21.860 --> 25:23.828
HEY, GUYS.

25:23.860 --> 25:24.963
- ALL RIGHT, YOU WANT TO LEARN
HOW TO WORK THIS THING?

25:25.000 --> 25:26.888
- MM-HMM.
- ALL RIGHT, HERE WE GO.

25:26.930 --> 25:30.104
WHAT WE WANT TO DO
IS ADD SOME DRUMS, RIGHT?

25:30.140 --> 25:31.277
- YEP.
- HEAR THAT?

25:31.320 --> 25:33.106
[drum beat playing]
HMM, WHAT DOES THAT NEED?

25:33.150 --> 25:35.766
OOH, I KNOW. A LITTLE BASS.
[bass line playing]

25:35.810 --> 25:39.075
PUT SOME BASS IN THERE. OKAY.
STARTING TO SOUND PRETTY GOOD.

25:39.120 --> 25:40.701
BUT I THINK I NEED
A LITTLE SOMETHING MORE.

25:40.740 --> 25:42.014
LET'S THROW SOME GUITAR
IN THERE.

25:42.050 --> 25:44.109
[guitar playing]
THEN WE GO LIKE THIS,

25:44.160 --> 25:47.084
AND THEN BOOM! HUH?
- WHOA! COOL.

25:47.130 --> 25:48.574
[full mix playing loudly]
- RIGHT?

25:48.610 --> 25:50.293
DON'T TELL ANYONE AROUND HERE
WHAT YOU SAW,

25:50.340 --> 25:52.160
'CAUSE I DON'T WANT EVERYONE
TO KNOW HOW FUN MY JOB IS.

25:52.200 --> 25:55.089
- HEY, CROSBY.
- OH, LOOK, IT'S HAPPY HOLLOW.

25:55.130 --> 25:57.712
HEY, HOW'S IT GOING?
- WE'RE SO EXCITED.

25:57.760 --> 25:59.728
- OH, GOOD.
- WE WERE THINKING TONIGHT

25:59.760 --> 26:01.728
MAYBE WE COULD JUST
DO IT, UM, LIVE

26:01.760 --> 26:04.479
AND KIND OF GET THAT RAW,
NATURAL SORT OF FEEL.

26:04.520 --> 26:06.272
- THAT'S GOOD.
WE'LL CAPTURE IT.

26:06.320 --> 26:07.389
- COOL.
WHO'S THAT?

26:07.420 --> 26:11.459
- OH, THIS IS MY SOUND ENGINEER
ASSISTANT, JABBAR.

26:11.500 --> 26:13.320
- HI, JABBAR.
- HI.

26:13.360 --> 26:14.975
- HE'S VERY GIFTED.

26:15.020 --> 26:16.396
- CAN I TALK TO YOU
FOR A SECOND?

26:16.430 --> 26:18.842
- YEAH.

26:18.880 --> 26:21.633
- IS HE GONNA IMPINGE?
- OH, NO, HE NEVER IMPINGES.

26:21.680 --> 26:22.908
I PROMISE.

26:22.960 --> 26:24.120
- 'CAUSE THIS IS REALLY,
REALLY IMPORTANT TO US.

26:24.160 --> 26:25.570
- TAKE HOW IMPORTANT
IT IS TO YOU,

26:25.610 --> 26:27.020
QUADRUPLE IT--

26:27.060 --> 26:28.618
THAT'S HOW IMPORTANT IT IS
TO JABBAR.

26:28.650 --> 26:32.199
- OKAY.
- GO SET UP, GET WILD.

26:32.240 --> 26:34.515
[car radio playing]

26:34.550 --> 26:38.338
- SHINE, SHINE, SHINE ON

26:38.380 --> 26:42.032
- HEY. HI.
HOW WAS YOUR DAY?

26:42.080 --> 26:44.241
- UM, MAYBE YOU SHOULD
LET GRANDMA AND GRANDPA

26:44.290 --> 26:46.383
HELP US BUY A NEW CAR.

26:46.430 --> 26:47.761
I'M JUST SAYING.
- YOU TOO?

26:47.810 --> 26:52.224
- I'M JUST SAYING.
- HEY, COME HERE FOR A SECOND.

26:52.260 --> 26:54.820
I WANT TO EXPLAIN TO YOU
WHY I DON'T WANT TO DO THAT.

26:54.850 --> 26:58.081
IN THIS FAMILY,
WE TAKE CARE OF OURSELVES,

26:58.130 --> 27:00.166
AND WE DON'T EXPECT
OTHER PEOPLE TO HELP US,

27:00.200 --> 27:01.815
WHICH IS WHY,
BY THE TIME I WAS YOUR AGE,

27:01.860 --> 27:06.786
I KNEW HOW TO CHANGE
A TIRE AND, UH...

27:06.830 --> 27:10.414
BAKE A CASSEROLE...
- A CASSEROLE?

27:10.450 --> 27:11.656
- AND BREAK INTO A CAR

27:11.690 --> 27:14.579
AND FASHION A TEPEE
OUT OF WOOD AND LEATHER.

27:14.630 --> 27:16.143
- REALLY?
REALLY, NOW?

27:16.180 --> 27:18.068
I WAS JUST SAYING--
- YOU DON'T BELIEVE ME?

27:18.110 --> 27:19.486
I DON'T THINK YOU GET MY POINT.
COME HERE.

27:19.530 --> 27:21.350
- MOM, I GET THE POINT.
- DO YOU?

27:21.390 --> 27:22.903
- YES.
I UNDERSTAND.

27:22.950 --> 27:25.350
- THEN GIVE ME A HUG.

27:25.400 --> 27:27.322
WHAT? WHAT?

27:27.360 --> 27:29.294
- LOOK AT YOU.
- COME HERE.

27:29.330 --> 27:31.434
YOU'RE STILL
MY FAVORITE SON.

27:33.470 --> 27:35.711
[rock music]

27:35.750 --> 27:38.401
- DON'T HALF-ASS IT!

28:24.350 --> 28:28.389
[distant chatter]

28:31.530 --> 28:33.350
- SORRY.

28:34.600 --> 28:35.771
- ALL RIGHT, NOW, REMEMBER, MAX,
THERE'S NO PRESSURE, OKAY?

28:35.810 --> 28:36.674
YOU JUST BE YOURSELF.

28:36.710 --> 28:37.847
- I WILL.

28:37.880 --> 28:39.017
- ARE YOU HUNGRY, HONEY?

28:39.060 --> 28:40.607
DO YOU WANT A SNACK?
I HAVE CRACKERS.

28:40.640 --> 28:42.119
I HAVE A BANANA.
I HAVE AN APPLE.

28:42.160 --> 28:43.229

I HAVE A GRANOLA BAR.
I HAVE A HARD-BOILED EGG.

28:46.340 --> 28:48.137
- NOPE.
- IT'S RIGHT DOWN THE HALL.

28:48.170 --> 28:52.163
- GRANOLA BAR? CHINESE MIX?
AN APPLE?

28:52.210 --> 28:54.826
- YOU JUST SAID THAT.
IS SOMETHING WRONG?

28:54.870 --> 28:56.064
- NO. WHY?

28:56.110 --> 28:58.249
- BECAUSE YOU'RE SAYING THE SAME
THING OVER AND OVER AGAIN,

28:58.280 --> 29:01.488
WHICH IS WHAT YOU DO
WHEN SOMETHING'S WRONG.

29:01.530 --> 29:02.929
- NO.
NO, WE DON'T.

29:02.980 --> 29:05.426
- OKAY, MAX,

JABBAR?

29:37.390 --> 29:40.109
OH, MAN, YOU SCARED THE CRAP

29:42.330 --> 29:46.289

UH, WHAT ARE YOU DOING BACK?

29:46.330 --> 29:48.082
- OH, I CAME STRAIGHT
FROM THE AIRPORT.

29:48.130 --> 29:50.291
APPARENTLY, MUSIC HISTORY
IS BEING MADE,

29:50.340 --> 29:53.548
AND THE BAND'S MANAGER TOLD ME
THAT I NEEDED TO BE HERE.

29:53.580 --> 29:55.161

29:55.200 --> 29:57.259

HE--HE CAN'T DRINK THAT.
HE'S LACTOSE INTOLERANT.

30:03.420 --> 30:06.173

30:10.840 --> 30:14.970
- UM, HEY.
UH, WELCOME BACK.

30:15.020 --> 30:16.089
I DON'T KNOW.
HE, UH--

30:16.120 --> 30:18.941
ONE OF THE GIRLS UP FRONT
ASKED ME TO WATCH HIM.

30:18.980 --> 30:21.608
- OKAY, WELL,
IT'S REALLY NICE TO MEET YOU.

30:21.640 --> 30:23.528
AND I'M GONNA GO CHECK

30:44.670 --> 30:46.114

30:54.540 --> 30:56.770

30:56.820 --> 30:57.946
THAT'S VERY NICE.
THANK YOU, SARAH.

30:57.990 --> 30:59.127
- WHAT DO YOU GOT THERE,
A ROCK OR--

30:59.160 --> 31:01.367
- NO, IT'S
A TIBETAN PRAYER STONE.

31:01.410 --> 31:04.857
- OH, DEAR GOD.
IT'S COME TO THIS?

31:04.890 --> 31:06.573
- I'M NOT TAKING ANY CHANCES.
- THIS?

31:06.620 --> 31:08.850
- IT WAS AN ABSOLUTE PLEASURE
TO MEET YOU, MAX.

31:08.900 --> 31:09.855
- HEY!

31:09.900 --> 31:11.037

31:18.220 --> 31:20.176

31:20.220 --> 31:21.972

31:24.910 --> 31:27.777
HER FINALS ARE TODAY.

31:27.810 --> 31:29.914
- HADDIE.

31:29.950 --> 31:31.326

WE ARE SO SORRY.

31:31.370 --> 31:33.429

SO I THINK IT'S LOOSENING.

32:20.240 --> 32:22.413
- WHAT DO YOU HAVE,
THE HALF-INCH?

32:22.450 --> 32:24.691
- YEAH.
- YOU MIGHT TRY A SMALLER ONE.

32:24.730 --> 32:28.723
- THAT'S TRUE. HERE.
OH...

32:28.770 --> 32:29.930
- MAYBE A LITTLE MORE OIL.

32:29.980 --> 32:33.143
- COULD YOU USE THIS,
SEE IF IT WORKS?

32:33.190 --> 32:35.841
OH, BOY.
- HERE IT GOES, KIND OF.

32:35.880 --> 32:37.939
- HERE, I'LL TRY
TO PUT THIS ON THERE,

32:37.990 --> 32:39.946
SEE IF IT WORKS.

32:39.990 --> 32:41.389

- YEAH.

32:41.440 --> 32:43.988

32:44.030 --> 32:45.645
- COME HERE,
GIVE ME A HAND.

32:45.680 --> 32:46.749

[knock on door]

32:48.480 --> 32:49.754
[door opens]

32:52.790 --> 32:53.893
- YOU MIND IF I COME IN?

32:53.930 --> 32:57.445
- IT'S FINE, DAD.
I'M OVER IT.

32:57.490 --> 32:58.650
- NO, IT'S NOT FINE.

33:03.180 --> 33:05.694
THERE ARE SOME DAYS
WHEN YOU JUST BLOW IT.

33:05.740 --> 33:07.048
YOU KNOW?

33:07.080 --> 33:09.594
AND THAT IS
WHAT HAPPENED TODAY.

33:09.640 --> 33:11.187
I BLEW IT.

33:11.230 --> 33:14.745
AND I'M--
I'M REALLY, REALLY SORRY.

33:14.780 --> 33:17.499
- IT'S OKAY.
REALLY.

33:17.540 --> 33:22.432
- AND I KNOW WITH EVERYTHING
THAT HAS BEEN GOING ON WITH MAX,

33:22.480 --> 33:25.369
YOU'VE BEEN HAVING
A ROUGH COUPLE OF WEEKS TOO.

33:25.410 --> 33:27.139
- WEEKS?

33:27.170 --> 33:30.617
DAD, TRY YEARS.

33:30.660 --> 33:31.797
- WHAT?

33:31.830 --> 33:34.697
- IT'S BEEN YEARS, DAD.

33:34.730 --> 33:39.667
WHY IS EVERYBODY ACTING LIKE
THIS MAX THING IS BIG NEWS?

33:39.700 --> 33:43.875
HE KNOCKED OVER THE CAKE
AT MY TENTH BIRTHDAY

33:43.910 --> 33:46.117
BECAUSE HE WAS AFRAID
OF THE CANDLES.

33:46.160 --> 33:47.366
WE HAD TO CHANGE ROOMS

33:47.400 --> 33:49.914
BECAUSE HE COULDN'T BE
BY THE AIR CONDITIONER.

33:49.950 --> 33:51.918
WHENEVER HE WANTS
TO WATCH TV,

33:51.960 --> 33:53.404
WE ALL HAVE TO GIVE UP.

33:53.440 --> 33:57.501
IT'S LIKE--
IT'S NEVER-ENDING.

33:57.550 --> 34:01.338
AND EVER SINCE I CAN REMEMBER,
IT'S BEEN ALL ABOUT MAX.

34:07.450 --> 34:09.623
- YOU'RE RIGHT.

34:09.660 --> 34:12.458
YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT.

34:17.810 --> 34:20.461
- DO YOU THINK HE'S GONNA GET
INTO THIS SCHOOL?

34:31.860 --> 34:35.159
- I AM VERY...

34:36.970 --> 34:39.200
VERY PROUD OF YOU...

34:47.980 --> 34:50.312
IN SO MANY WAYS.

35:10.100 --> 35:12.239
- HEY.
- HEY.

35:12.280 --> 35:14.168
THEY KEPT YOU LATE.

35:14.210 --> 35:16.553
- YES, THEY DID.
[sighs]

35:16.590 --> 35:20.174
THE PRICE YOU PAY
FOR TAKING A LITTLE DIP

35:20.220 --> 35:23.769
IN THE MIDDLE OF THE DAY.

35:23.810 --> 35:26.358
- YEAH, SPEAKING OF THAT...

35:26.400 --> 35:29.085
HEY, SYDNEY, MOM'S HOME.

35:29.120 --> 35:32.908

LOOK AT YOU!

35:43.410 --> 35:47.039
- I DID IT!

35:47.070 --> 35:48.719
- YOU SWAM?

35:48.760 --> 35:52.389
- YEAH, AWAY FROM THE SIDE
AND BACK.

35:52.420 --> 35:55.218
- OH. SHOW ME AGAIN.
- OKAY.

35:55.250 --> 35:56.626
- READY? GO!

35:56.670 --> 35:58.183
SHE NEVER WOULD HAVE BEEN ABLE
TO DO IT

35:58.220 --> 35:59.949
WITHOUT YOU TORTURING HER.

36:01.950 --> 36:04.942
- I DID IT!
- YEAH, YOU DID IT!

36:04.990 --> 36:06.776
HIGH FIVE.
- SHOW ME AGAIN.

36:06.810 --> 36:08.289
[laughter]

36:16.000 --> 36:18.821
- HOW MUCH LONGER?

36:18.860 --> 36:23.308
- UH, YOUR MOM SAID
SHE'D BE HERE ANY MINUTE NOW.

36:26.590 --> 36:30.105
HEY, LISTEN...

36:30.150 --> 36:32.971
YOU KNOW WHAT I TOLD
THAT LADY BEFORE

36:33.010 --> 36:34.284
ABOUT WHO YOU WERE?

36:34.330 --> 36:38.846
I JUST GOT REALLY SCARED.

36:38.880 --> 36:40.802
IT WAS STUPID.

36:46.030 --> 36:48.669
- IT'S OKAY.
I UNDERSTAND.

36:49.690 --> 36:50.884
- YOU DO?

37:06.010 --> 37:07.489
IS THIS WHY YOU RAN AND HID,

37:07.530 --> 37:09.760
'CAUSE YOU BROKE THIS
OFF THE MIXING BOARD?

37:11.150 --> 37:13.732
- I THOUGHT YOU'D BE MAD.

37:19.090 --> 37:21.604
- YOU KNOW...

37:23.650 --> 37:25.379
I WOULD HAVE DONE
THE EXACT SAME THING.

37:25.410 --> 37:26.820
- [chuckles]

37:39.080 --> 37:40.934
- ALL RIGHT, THEN.

37:40.980 --> 37:42.834
[sighs]
I GUESS THAT'S IT.

37:42.880 --> 37:44.768
- YOU SURE?

37:44.810 --> 37:46.971
- MM-HMM.

37:47.020 --> 37:48.464
[car door closes]

37:48.500 --> 37:51.367
- YOU'RE NOT GONNA CRY OVER
THIS PIECE OF JUNK, ARE YOU?

37:51.400 --> 37:53.288
- NO.
- OKAY.

37:53.340 --> 37:57.436
- I KNOW IT'S A BAD CAR.
IT'S JUST...

37:57.480 --> 38:00.506
AMBER SAID
HER FIRST WORD IN IT--

38:00.550 --> 38:03.519
"NO."

38:03.550 --> 38:06.997
DREW CAME WITHIN TWO BLOCKS
OF BEING BORN IN IT.

38:07.040 --> 38:09.793
IT HARDLY EVER WORKED,
BUT THE DAY I NEEDED

38:09.830 --> 38:13.004
TO MOVE THEM OUT OF SETH'S,
IT STARTED ON THE FIRST TRY.

38:14.980 --> 38:17.426

38:37.000 --> 38:40.618
I'VE BEEN SPENDING A LOT OF TIME
IN THE GUESTHOUSE.

38:40.660 --> 38:42.867
I'VE BEEN SLEEPING THERE,
AND THAT'S...

38:42.900 --> 38:45.721
WHY I TOLD YOU
YOU COULDN'T MOVE IN,

38:45.770 --> 38:47.101
SO, UH...

38:47.150 --> 38:48.970
IT WAS SELFISH.

38:49.010 --> 38:52.457
I'M SELFISH SOMETIMES.

38:52.500 --> 38:55.776
I WANT YOU TO KNOW THAT,

THIS SUMMER
I SWAM IN THE OCEAN

I MIGHT HAVE DROWNED

41:13.090 --> 41:16.366
BUT I HELD MY BREATH,
AND I KICKED MY FEET

41:16.400 --> 41:19.324
AND I MOVED MY ARMS AROUND

41:19.370 --> 41:22.430
MOVED MY ARMS AROUND

41:22.480 --> 41:24.232
- YEAH!

41:24.270 --> 41:26.238
[cheering]

41:26.270 --> 41:28.443
[laughter]

41:28.480 --> 41:29.959
[school bell ringing]
- HERE YOU GO.

41:30.000 --> 41:32.139
STILL EXCITED?

41:32.170 --> 41:33.899
I'M EXCITED.

41:33.930 --> 41:36.342
- OKAY IF I RUN AHEAD?
IT'S 8:14.

41:36.390 --> 41:38.039
- YEP. SURE.
- YEAH.

41:38.080 --> 41:41.140
- HAVE A GOOD DAY, MAX.
- WE LOVE YOU.

41:58.510 --> 42:00.057
[knocking on door]

42:07.110 --> 42:08.236
- HEY, SARAH.

42:10.660 --> 42:11.934
- CAN I COME IN?

42:17.050 --> 42:18.426
- YOU LIKE LASAGNA?

42:18.460 --> 42:21.281
- TAKE ME FROM

42:21.330 --> 42:27.155
THE LONELIEST

42:27.190 --> 42:31.149
PLACE

42:31.200 --> 42:33.885
I HAVE KNOWN
