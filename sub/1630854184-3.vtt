10:54.321 --> 10:55.845
My editor reminds me,

10:55.888 --> 10:59.022
it's seven years before
car seats are mandatory.

10:59.065 --> 11:02.982
My ex-wife reminds me,
I never owned a Buick.

This is the odyssey
of recollection."

11:12.688 --> 11:16.822
The tapes are an admitted
performance.

11:17.823 --> 11:21.827
This is the premise
of our interview.

11:21.871 --> 11:27.528
Half a century later,
allow me my odyssey.

[Computer beeps]

12:03.782 --> 12:06.045
You were the prince
of your district.

12:06.089 --> 12:07.612
Lestat chased
an American icon

12:07.655 --> 12:10.833
outta town because
he loved you.

12:10.876 --> 12:14.488
1917 doesn't sound like
it was such a bad year.

Rigged to burn, Daniel.

12:17.404 --> 12:20.277
A silent bridge for
your voice to float along.

You talk like you play,
Mr. Lioncourt.

12:22.583 --> 12:25.935
Louis: Lestat filled in
for Jelly the next night.

12:25.978 --> 12:28.502
He and Miss Brown
dazzled the waiting johns

12:28.546 --> 12:31.767
and invited their admirers
back to the Rue Royale.

12:31.810 --> 12:34.987
So, the last one to leave
never left?

12:35.031 --> 12:36.772
No.

12:36.815 --> 12:39.165
He would do his killing
away from me now,

12:39.209 --> 12:41.820
out of respect, he said,
for the choice I had made.

12:44.170 --> 12:45.650
'Round the back.

repeated itself

12:50.655 --> 12:52.962
every night for two weeks.

12:53.005 --> 12:54.702
They would add another song
to their set

12:54.746 --> 12:56.139
and work on another at night,

12:56.182 --> 13:00.012
while I tried to adapt
to my new diet.

13:00.056 --> 13:02.798
I barely had the energy
to hold up a book.

13:02.841 --> 13:04.103
My libido was not
what it had been.

13:04.147 --> 13:05.583
Man: Hey!

13:05.626 --> 13:07.367
I understood
the indulgence.

13:07.411 --> 13:08.847
I let it happen.

13:08.891 --> 13:10.936
Mr. Louis, you have
to convince Lestat

13:10.980 --> 13:12.590
to keep playin'.

13:12.633 --> 13:15.985
Got a better chance makin'
the Mississippi run north.

13:16.028 --> 13:17.595
We had a good run,
but I did it for Louis.

13:17.638 --> 13:19.379
I do everything
for Louis.

13:19.423 --> 13:21.164
Yeah, I heard
that about you two.

13:21.207 --> 13:23.340
Oh? Well, what
have you heard?

13:23.383 --> 13:24.689
I'm not a gossip.

13:24.732 --> 13:26.212
But I am.

13:26.256 --> 13:30.086
Well, people at the Azalea,
they say...

13:30.129 --> 13:33.306
You're confusing me.
[Laughs]

13:33.350 --> 13:36.309
Oh, come now.

13:36.353 --> 13:37.920
I don't bite.

13:40.879 --> 13:42.576
What do the employees
of the Azalea say

13:42.620 --> 13:44.535
about Louis and Lestat?

13:44.578 --> 13:45.841
I'll answer
with a question.

13:45.884 --> 13:47.016
Mm-hmm.

13:47.059 --> 13:50.584
Are there two beds
upstairs or one?

13:50.628 --> 13:51.847
Do you want to find out?

13:51.890 --> 13:53.936
No one goes upstairs,
Miss Brown.

13:53.979 --> 13:55.938
Well, there's my answer.

13:55.981 --> 14:01.421
Still, what do you imagine
confines us to a single note?

14:01.465 --> 14:04.555
Why not a chord?
Why not a cluster?

14:04.598 --> 14:06.600
Oh, see, I'm the same.

14:06.644 --> 14:08.646

I was beginning to wonder
about your manners.

There's a dentistry
convention in town.

Sinister talk of molars and
bicuspids around every corner.

15:13.667 --> 15:15.626
So, you didn't kill her.

simmered on diet

receiving American troops.

or you could --

A hastily composed
attempt by the city

17:11.959 --> 17:14.397
to segregate Storyville.

17:14.440 --> 17:16.399
It required that all
prostitutes

17:16.442 --> 17:18.444
of colored or Black race

17:18.488 --> 17:21.534
move their business
across Canal Street.

This was the heart
of my business,

17:24.276 --> 17:26.539

the ordinance into law

17:30.108 --> 17:32.458
were some of my best clients.

17:32.502 --> 17:36.201
It was an absurdity,
an affront to a Creole man

his fair-skinned competitors.

manage it?

How you put it, Bricks?

Deprives us the use
of our property

denying us equal protection

17:55.481 --> 17:58.223

of these United States.

Russian Bolshevik scheme.

18:01.313 --> 18:02.923
You diddled
the man's money,

18:02.967 --> 18:05.056

an end-around.

Not as colorful as

at the high pile
