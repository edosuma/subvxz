00:02.127 --> 00:04.086
Dad wants us to pick up
where he left off.

00:04.254 --> 00:07.089
Saving people, hunting things,
the family business.

00:12.512 --> 00:16.015
You plan on bringing the demon here.
Having some stupid, macho showdown.

00:16.181 --> 00:19.727
- I have a plan, Sam.
- Dean is dying and you have a plan.

00:19.936 --> 00:23.230
I won't hunt this demon.
Not until we know Dean's okay.

00:23.606 --> 00:25.607
Did you really think
you could trap me?

00:25.775 --> 00:28.027
I don't wanna trap you.
I wanna make a deal.

00:28.194 --> 00:31.363
I will give you the Colt and the bullet.
But you gotta help Dean.

00:31.531 --> 00:35.451
- You gotta bring him back.
- You still need to sweeten the pot.

00:35.618 --> 00:37.953
Key of Solomon.
Protective circles really work?

00:38.121 --> 00:40.748
Get a demon in one,
they're trapped, powerless.

03:21.910 --> 03:23.577
- What's going on?
- Oh, my God.

03:26.122 --> 03:27.122
Get a doctor.

03:28.374 --> 03:29.416
Run.

03:31.252 --> 03:33.962
- What happened? Talk to me.
- Dogs.

03:34.255 --> 03:37.925
- Stay with us, baby.
- Dogs. Black dogs.

03:38.092 --> 03:41.470
Bob?
Robert, don't you die on me.

03:53.983 --> 03:56.151
Great. Thanks, Phil.

03:58.988 --> 04:00.572
So much for our low profile.

04:00.740 --> 04:04.159
You got a warrant in St. Louis.
You're officially in the Feds' database.

04:04.327 --> 04:06.828
- I'm like Dillinger or something.
- It's not funny.

04:06.996 --> 04:08.830
Makes it harder, we gotta be careful.

04:08.998 --> 04:10.749
What do they got on you?

04:12.543 --> 04:15.128
I'm sure they just
haven't posted it yet.

04:15.296 --> 04:17.422
- No accessory? Nothing?
- Shut up.

04:18.466 --> 04:19.841
- You're jealous.
- No, I'm not.

04:20.009 --> 04:21.051
Uh-huh.

04:22.845 --> 04:25.180
All right, what do you got
on the case there...

04:25.348 --> 04:27.307
...you innocent,
harmless young man, you?

04:29.811 --> 04:33.355
"Architect Sean Boyden plummeted
to his death from the roof of his home...

04:33.523 --> 04:35.148
...a condominium he designed."

04:35.316 --> 04:37.859
Build a high-rise
and jump off the top of it. Classy.

04:38.152 --> 04:40.654
- When did he call Animal Control?
- Two days earlier.

04:40.989 --> 04:42.823
- Did he actually say, black dog?
- Yeah.

04:42.991 --> 04:45.158
"Vicious, wild black dog."

04:45.326 --> 04:48.203
The authorities couldn't find it,
no one else saw it.

04:48.371 --> 04:50.122
In fact, authorities are confused...

04:50.290 --> 04:52.791
...as to how a wild dog could get past
the doorman...

04:52.959 --> 04:56.378
...take the elevator and roam
the halls of the cushiest joint in town.

04:56.587 --> 04:58.338
After that, no more calls...

04:58.506 --> 05:01.717
...he doesn't show up for work.
Two days later he takes a swan dive.

05:01.884 --> 05:04.553
- We're dealing with an actual black dog?
- Well, maybe.

05:04.721 --> 05:06.638
- What's the lore on it?
- It's vague.

05:07.098 --> 05:09.683
There are spectral black dogs
all over the world.

05:09.851 --> 05:12.394
Some say they're animal spirits,
others, death omens.

05:12.562 --> 05:15.564
But anyways, whatever they are,
they're big, nasty-

05:15.732 --> 05:19.151
I bet they could hump the crap out
of your leg. Look at that one.

05:20.903 --> 05:22.029
What? They could.

05:25.074 --> 05:28.243
So you and Sean Boyden were
business partners...

05:28.536 --> 05:30.996
...for almost 10 years, right?

05:31.164 --> 05:33.165
That's right.
One more time, this is for-?

05:33.499 --> 05:37.044
A tribute for Mr. Boyden.
Architectural Digest.

05:39.130 --> 05:41.631
- Funny to you?
- No.

05:41.841 --> 05:45.385
It's just a- Tribute. Yeah.

05:45.845 --> 05:47.637
See, Sean always got the tributes.

05:49.390 --> 05:51.099
He kills himself...

05:51.267 --> 05:53.435
...leaves me and his family behind...

05:53.603 --> 05:56.855
- ...but he gets another tribute.
- Right.

05:57.023 --> 05:58.690
Any idea why he'd do such a thing?

05:58.858 --> 06:01.360
I have no clue.
I mean, he lived the charmed life.

06:02.278 --> 06:05.238
- How so?
- He was a flat-out genius.

06:05.406 --> 06:07.866
I mean, I'm capable, but next to him...

06:09.243 --> 06:11.036
It wasn't always that way, either.

06:11.204 --> 06:12.579
No?

06:13.456 --> 06:15.123
Wanna know the truth?

06:15.291 --> 06:17.793
There was a time
when he couldn't design a pup tent.

06:17.960 --> 06:20.128
Hell, 10 years ago,
he worked as a bartender...

06:20.296 --> 06:22.547
...at this place called Lloyd's.
Complete dive.

06:22.715 --> 06:25.050
- Right. So, what changed?
You got me.

06:25.301 --> 06:28.387
But overnight,
he gets this huge commission...

06:28.554 --> 06:30.722
...and he starts designing...

06:31.224 --> 06:34.059
He starts designing
the most ingenious buildings...

06:34.268 --> 06:35.977
...anyone has ever seen.

06:36.145 --> 06:39.439
It was like the level
of Van Gogh and Mozart-

06:40.316 --> 06:41.817
- What?
It's funny.

06:42.235 --> 06:45.404
True geniuses,
they seem to die young, don't they?

06:48.157 --> 06:50.826
To have that kind of talent.

06:51.661 --> 06:53.245
Why-?

06:53.413 --> 06:56.164
Why just throw it away?

07:06.467 --> 07:09.302
So?
- The secretary's name is Carly.

07:09.470 --> 07:11.972
She's 23, she kayaks...

07:12.140 --> 07:13.265
...and they're real.

07:13.433 --> 07:15.851
You didn't ask
if she's seen any black dogs lately?

07:16.018 --> 07:19.604
Every complaint called in this week
about anything big, black or dog-like.

07:19.772 --> 07:20.981
There's 19 calls in all.

07:21.149 --> 07:22.315
And...

07:23.359 --> 07:25.527
...I don't know what this thing is.

07:26.946 --> 07:30.490
- You mean Carly's MySpace address?
- MySpace, what the hell is that?

07:31.784 --> 07:34.661
Seriously, is that like
some sort of porn site?

07:38.374 --> 07:42.794
I swear, if this is another Pomeranian
barking in the neighbor's yard...

07:43.045 --> 07:44.713
Afternoon, ma'am.

07:44.881 --> 07:46.381
Animal Control.

07:46.549 --> 07:49.885
- Someone already came yesterday.
- Oh, we're just following up.

07:50.052 --> 07:52.471
We're looking
for a Dr. Sylvia Pearlman.

07:53.764 --> 07:56.057
The doctor, well, she-

07:56.267 --> 07:58.685
I don't know when she'll be back.
She left two days ago.

07:58.853 --> 08:00.061
Okay. And you are?

08:00.396 --> 08:02.814
- I'm Ms. Pearlman's maid.
- Where did the doctor go?

08:02.982 --> 08:06.276
I'm not sure. She just packed
and went. She didn't say where.

08:06.569 --> 08:10.030
- That stray dog, did you find it finally?
- Not yet.

08:10.198 --> 08:13.658
You know, you didn't ever happen
to see the dog yourself, did you?

08:13.868 --> 08:16.203
Well, no. I never even heard it.

08:16.787 --> 08:19.331
I was starting to think
the doctor was imagining it.

08:19.499 --> 08:21.833
- She's not like that. So-
I read she was...

08:22.001 --> 08:24.252
...a chief surgeon at the hospital?

08:24.420 --> 08:26.171
She's gotta be what, 42, 43?

08:26.339 --> 08:29.216
- That's pretty young for that job.
- Youngest in the history.

08:29.383 --> 08:33.094
- She got the position 10 years ago.
- Huh.

08:33.513 --> 08:37.390
- An overnight success, 10 years ago.
- Yeah, we know a guy like that.

08:38.683 --> 08:40.559
Oh, look at this.

08:43.438 --> 08:45.357
Lloyd's Bar.

09:12.426 --> 09:13.760
Miss Pearlman?

09:14.470 --> 09:15.971
I've been calling for hours.

09:16.138 --> 09:19.724
You need to vacate the room
or you gotta pay for another night.

09:23.145 --> 09:24.938
Okay. No problem.

10:07.189 --> 10:09.524
- Hey.
- Yeah?

10:10.901 --> 10:12.944
That's weird.
What?

10:13.112 --> 10:14.904
You think someone planted these?

10:17.700 --> 10:20.952
In the middle of all these weeds?
- These are, what-do-you-call-them?

10:21.162 --> 10:22.537
- Yarrow flowers.
- Yeah.

10:22.705 --> 10:27.208
- Used for certain rituals, aren't they?
- Yeah, actually, summoning rituals.

10:29.920 --> 10:34.215
So two people become sudden successes
about 10 years ago...

10:34.383 --> 10:36.509
...around the time
they were here at Lloyd's.

10:36.677 --> 10:39.054
Where there happens to be
a crossroads. You think?

10:39.221 --> 10:40.513
Let's find out.

10:46.687 --> 10:49.314
This seem about
the dead center to you?

10:55.863 --> 10:57.238
Yahtzee.

11:11.712 --> 11:14.506
I'd be willing to bet
that's graveyard dirt.

11:15.257 --> 11:17.384
And a black cat bone.

11:17.551 --> 11:21.179
That's serious spell work. I mean,
that's deep south hoodoo stuff.

11:21.389 --> 11:22.764
Used to summon a demon.

11:24.183 --> 11:26.267
Not just summon one.

11:26.477 --> 11:28.603
Crossroads are where pacts are made.

11:29.271 --> 11:32.440
These people are actually making deals
with the damn thing.

11:32.608 --> 11:35.026
You know,
because that always ends good.

11:35.611 --> 11:37.946
They're seeing dogs, all right.

11:38.114 --> 11:40.365
But not black dogs,
they are seeing hellhounds.

11:40.950 --> 11:42.450
Demonic pit bulls.

11:42.618 --> 11:45.745
And whoever this demon is,
it's back and it's collecting.

11:45.913 --> 11:49.124
That doctor lady,
wherever she's running...

11:49.291 --> 11:51.459
...she ain't running fast enough.

13:16.670 --> 13:17.712
Holy-

13:18.047 --> 13:19.881
Holy?

13:22.343 --> 13:23.384
Guess again.

13:30.684 --> 13:33.061
I wanna play guitar.

13:33.354 --> 13:36.940
I want you to make me
the best bluesman ever lived.

13:37.650 --> 13:40.318
If that's what you want.

13:43.656 --> 13:45.615
So how do we-?

13:45.783 --> 13:47.116
Do we shake on it?

14:17.189 --> 14:19.607
So it's just like
the Robert Johnson legend, right?

14:19.775 --> 14:22.110
Selling your soul
at the crossroads kind of deal?

14:22.278 --> 14:25.613
Yeah, except that wasn't a legend.
You know his music.

14:26.532 --> 14:28.324
You don't know
Robert Johnson's songs?

14:28.993 --> 14:31.661
There's occult references
all over his lyrics. I mean:

14:31.829 --> 14:34.497
"Cross Road Blues,"
"Me and the Devil Blues"...

14:34.665 --> 14:37.208
..."Hell Hound on My Trail"?

14:38.127 --> 14:40.587
The story goes
that he died choking on his own blood.

14:40.754 --> 14:44.966
He was hallucinating
and muttering about big, evil dogs.

14:45.134 --> 14:47.635
- Now it's happening all over again.
- Yeah.

14:47.803 --> 14:50.555
We gotta find out
if anyone else struck any bargains here.

14:50.723 --> 14:53.141
Great. So we gotta clean up
people's mess for them?

14:53.309 --> 14:55.268
They're not exactly squeaky clean.

14:55.436 --> 14:57.896
Nobody forced them
to play Let's Make a Deal.

14:58.063 --> 15:01.649
- So, what? We just leave them?
- Someone goes over Niagara in a barrel...

15:01.859 --> 15:03.818
- ...you gonna try to save them?
- Dean.

15:05.195 --> 15:07.822
All right. Fine.

15:09.366 --> 15:12.452
Rituals like this, you put
your own photo into the mix, right?

15:12.661 --> 15:16.456
This guy probably summoned the thing.
I'll go see if anyone inside knows him.

15:16.832 --> 15:17.874
If he's still alive.

15:26.050 --> 15:28.384
What's the guy's name again?
George Darrow.

15:28.594 --> 15:31.346
Apparently quite the regular at Lloyd's.

15:31.513 --> 15:34.891
His house probably ain't up next
on MTV Cribs, is it?

15:35.059 --> 15:37.560
Yeah. So, whatever kind
of deal he made...

15:37.811 --> 15:38.978
It wasn't for cash.

15:39.188 --> 15:43.316
Oh, who knows? Maybe his place is
full of babes in Princess Leia bikinis?

15:43.692 --> 15:47.779
I'm just saying, this guy's got
one epic bill come due.

15:47.947 --> 15:50.114
Hope at least
he asked for something fun.

15:56.705 --> 15:57.997
Look at that.

16:04.088 --> 16:05.588
What is that, pepper?

16:09.009 --> 16:11.135
- Who the hell are you?
- George Darrow?

16:11.428 --> 16:13.137
I'm not buying anything.

16:13.347 --> 16:15.473
Looks like you went
for the wrong shaker.

16:15.724 --> 16:18.935
Usually when you wanna keep
something evil out, you go for the salt.

16:20.896 --> 16:24.649
- I don't know what you're talking about.
- Talking about this.

16:27.736 --> 16:30.655
Tell me. You seen that hellhound yet?

16:31.240 --> 16:33.449
Look, we wanna help.

16:33.617 --> 16:36.244
Please. Just five minutes.

16:49.591 --> 16:53.553
- So, what is that stuff out front?
- Goofer dust.

16:55.806 --> 17:00.309
You boys think you know something
about something but not goofer dust?

17:04.606 --> 17:06.648
We know a little about a lot of things.

17:06.817 --> 17:09.027
Just enough to make us dangerous.

17:09.778 --> 17:12.905
- What is it?
- Hoodoo.

17:13.073 --> 17:14.824
My grandma taught me.

17:15.325 --> 17:16.701
Keeps out demons.

17:16.868 --> 17:18.118
Demons we know.

17:18.328 --> 17:20.538
Well, then, keep it.

17:20.955 --> 17:23.583
Maybe it'll do you some good.

17:26.545 --> 17:27.712
Four minutes left.

17:31.467 --> 17:32.508
Mr. Darrow.

17:33.510 --> 17:37.472
- We know you're in trouble.
- Yeah, that you got yourself into.

17:37.806 --> 17:39.891
But it's not hopeless, all right?

17:40.601 --> 17:43.019
- There's gotta be something we can do.
- Listen.

17:43.187 --> 17:45.104
I get that you boys wanna help.

17:46.315 --> 17:50.651
But sometimes a person makes their bed
and they just got to lie down in it.

17:53.989 --> 17:56.699
I'm the one who called that demon
in the first place.

17:57.326 --> 18:00.369
- What did you do it for?
- I was weak.

18:00.537 --> 18:02.747
I mean, who don't wanna be great?

18:02.915 --> 18:05.083
Who don't want their life
to mean something?

18:07.252 --> 18:09.128
I just-

18:09.671 --> 18:11.839
I just never thought about the price.

18:12.132 --> 18:15.093
- Was it worth it?
- Hell, no.

18:15.344 --> 18:17.220
Of course, I asked for talent.

18:17.387 --> 18:19.889
Should have gone for fame.

18:20.682 --> 18:22.767
I'm still broke.

18:22.935 --> 18:24.227
And lonely.

18:24.394 --> 18:27.355
Just now I got this pile of paintings
don't nobody want.

18:29.858 --> 18:31.359
But that wasn't the worst.

18:35.364 --> 18:37.031
Go on.

18:37.616 --> 18:39.033
Demon didn't leave.

18:39.618 --> 18:42.370
I never counted on that.
After our deal was done...

18:42.538 --> 18:44.914
...the damn thing stayed at Lloyd's
for a week...

18:45.082 --> 18:48.292
...just chatting, making more deals.

18:49.920 --> 18:53.965
I tried to warn folks,
but who's gonna listen to an old drunk?

18:54.133 --> 18:58.678
- How many others are there?
- This architect, a doctor lady.

18:58.887 --> 19:01.889
I kept up with them.
They been in the papers.

19:02.766 --> 19:05.268
At least they got famous.

19:05.477 --> 19:07.228
Who else, George? Come on, think.

19:07.980 --> 19:09.772
One more.

19:10.899 --> 19:12.400
Nice guy too.

19:13.902 --> 19:16.904
Hudson. Evan, I think.

19:17.656 --> 19:20.241
I don't know what he asked for.

19:20.617 --> 19:22.118
Don't matter now.

19:22.327 --> 19:23.494
We done for.

19:24.705 --> 19:25.746
No.

19:25.914 --> 19:27.915
- There's gotta be a way.
- You don't get it.

19:28.458 --> 19:30.334
I don't want a way.

19:30.669 --> 19:33.337
- Look, you don't have-
- Look, I called that thing.

19:33.505 --> 19:35.756
I brought it on myself.

19:36.925 --> 19:39.260
I brought it on them.

19:40.345 --> 19:43.931
I'm going to hell,
one way or another.

19:44.850 --> 19:46.767
All I want is to finish
my last painting.

19:47.978 --> 19:50.396
A day or two, I'm done.

19:50.564 --> 19:53.649
I'm just trying to hold him off
till the end.

19:53.942 --> 19:55.735
Buy a little time.

19:56.612 --> 20:00.072
Okay, boys. Time you went.
Go help somebody that wants help.

20:00.240 --> 20:01.949
We can't just-
Get out!

20:02.951 --> 20:04.660
I got work to do.

20:04.953 --> 20:06.454
You don't really wanna die.

20:08.081 --> 20:09.123
I don't?

20:13.545 --> 20:15.379
I'm...

20:16.256 --> 20:18.090
I'm tired.

20:53.752 --> 20:57.088
Evan, you're spying on the neighbors?

20:57.839 --> 21:01.676
No, I- I thought I heard something
in the yard, but it's nothing.

21:03.387 --> 21:05.846
- You all ready to go?
- If I didn't know better...

21:06.014 --> 21:08.182
...I'd say that you want me
out of the house.

21:09.017 --> 21:10.017
Of course not.

21:10.185 --> 21:13.938
It's just you've barely seen
your sister since she had the baby.

21:14.106 --> 21:16.023
Well, what are you gonna do
all weekend?

21:18.193 --> 21:20.653
Not much, I got some bills to pay.

21:25.701 --> 21:27.034
Come here.

21:31.331 --> 21:33.374
- I'll miss you.
- You better.

21:37.129 --> 21:38.754
You know I love you, right?

21:39.089 --> 21:40.548
Forever.

21:40.841 --> 21:42.717
Of course. Evan, are you okay?

21:44.052 --> 21:45.761
Yeah.

21:46.388 --> 21:47.430
Yeah, I'm fine.

21:49.057 --> 21:50.725
Now get going.

21:52.602 --> 21:54.603
Okay, I'll call you when I get there.

21:56.732 --> 21:58.816
Hey, sweetie?

22:05.449 --> 22:06.574
I love you too.

22:22.466 --> 22:24.008
- Yes?
- Evan Hudson?

22:24.176 --> 22:27.011
- Yeah.
- You ever been to a bar called Lloyd's?

22:27.179 --> 22:29.055
Would have been about 10 years ago?

22:30.474 --> 22:31.932
Come on, we're not demons.

22:34.519 --> 22:36.771
Any other bright ideas?

22:48.283 --> 22:49.825
Wait.

23:02.422 --> 23:04.090
- Evan?
- Please.

23:04.674 --> 23:06.926
- Don't hurt me.
- We're not gonna hurt you.

23:07.094 --> 23:10.429
- We're here to help you.
- We know all about the deal you made.

23:10.680 --> 23:13.557
- What? How?
- It doesn't matter.

23:13.809 --> 23:16.727
- We're trying to stop it.
- How do I know you're not lying?

23:16.937 --> 23:19.897
Well, you don't, but you're low
on options there, buddy boy.

23:25.320 --> 23:29.031
- Can you stop it?
- Don't know. We'll try.

23:30.242 --> 23:32.827
- I don't wanna die.
- Of course you don't. Not now.

23:32.994 --> 23:34.078
Dean. Stop.

23:34.246 --> 23:36.163
What did you ask for, anyway, Ev?

23:36.706 --> 23:39.333
Never need Viagra?
Bowl a perfect game? What?

23:42.337 --> 23:43.462
My wife.

23:44.965 --> 23:47.591
Right. Getting the girl.
That's worth a trip to hell.

23:47.759 --> 23:49.510
- Dean. Stop.
- No.

23:50.345 --> 23:52.638
He's right. I made the deal.

23:53.890 --> 23:54.974
Nobody twisted my arm.

23:56.518 --> 24:00.020
That woman, or whatever she was,
at the bar-

24:00.188 --> 24:04.191
She said I could have anything I wanted.
I thought she was nuts at first, but-

24:09.114 --> 24:11.115
I don't know, I was...

24:11.366 --> 24:12.867
I was desperate.

24:13.368 --> 24:14.785
Desperate?

24:20.709 --> 24:22.710
Julie was dying.

24:27.674 --> 24:29.008
You did it to save her?

24:31.636 --> 24:35.181
She had cancer. They stopped treatment,
they were moving her into hospice.

24:35.390 --> 24:36.515
They kept saying:

24:36.683 --> 24:38.392
"A matter of days."

24:40.645 --> 24:42.313
So, yeah, I made the deal.

24:42.481 --> 24:43.731
And I'd do it again.

24:44.024 --> 24:45.774
I'd have died for her on the spot.

24:50.489 --> 24:53.240
- Did you think about her in all this?
- I did this for her.

24:53.408 --> 24:55.034
You sure about that?

24:56.536 --> 24:58.787
I think you did it for yourself.

24:59.247 --> 25:01.916
So you wouldn't have to live
without her.

25:02.292 --> 25:05.211
But guess what, she's gonna have
to live without you now.

25:07.839 --> 25:09.757
And what if she knew
how much it cost?

25:11.343 --> 25:14.428
What if she knew it cost your soul?
How do you think she'd feel?

25:15.805 --> 25:17.723
Okay. That's enough. Evan.

25:18.016 --> 25:20.935
Sit tight. All right?
We're gonna figure this out.

25:29.361 --> 25:31.111
- You all right?
- Why wouldn't I be?

25:32.781 --> 25:34.448
Hey, I got an idea.

25:34.824 --> 25:38.827
Throw the hoodoo at the hellhound.
Keep it away as long as you can.

25:38.995 --> 25:41.080
I'll go to the crossroads,
summon the demon.

25:41.248 --> 25:43.123
Summon- Are you nuts?

25:44.125 --> 25:45.584
Maybe a little.

25:45.752 --> 25:48.128
But I can trap it. I can exorcise it...

25:48.296 --> 25:50.422
...and buy us time
to figure out something.

25:50.590 --> 25:52.132
- How much time?
- A while.

25:52.467 --> 25:55.636
It's not easy for them to claw
from hell into the sunshine.

25:55.845 --> 25:58.055
- No. No way.
- Not allowed to say no.

25:58.223 --> 26:00.224
- Unless you got a better idea.
- Forget it.

26:00.392 --> 26:01.934
- I'm not letting you.
- Why not?

26:02.102 --> 26:04.520
- I don't like where your head is at.
- What?

26:04.688 --> 26:07.106
You've been on edge
since we found that crossroads.

26:07.274 --> 26:08.983
- I know why.
- Don't have time for it.

26:09.192 --> 26:10.693
Dad.

26:12.195 --> 26:15.489
You think maybe dad made one
of these deals, huh?

26:17.200 --> 26:19.159
Hell, I've been thinking it.

26:19.995 --> 26:22.204
I'm sure you've been thinking it too.

26:29.546 --> 26:31.714
It fits, doesn't it?

26:32.507 --> 26:35.843
I'm alive, dad's dead.
Yellow-eyed demon was involved.

26:38.221 --> 26:40.055
What if he did?

26:40.765 --> 26:42.891
What if he struck a deal?

26:43.560 --> 26:45.894
My life for his soul?

26:48.523 --> 26:50.524
I think I hear it. It's outside.

26:50.692 --> 26:52.735
Just keep him alive, okay?

26:53.778 --> 26:55.154
- Dean-
- Go.

27:21.097 --> 27:24.683
So, what brings a guy like you
to a place like this?

27:27.854 --> 27:31.565
- You called me?
- I'm just glad it worked.

27:32.567 --> 27:34.234
First time?

27:35.236 --> 27:36.403
You could say that.

27:36.780 --> 27:40.658
Oh, come on, now,
don't sell yourself short.

27:40.825 --> 27:44.119
I know all about you,
Dean Winchester.

27:46.081 --> 27:49.208
- So you know who I am?
- I get the newsletter.

27:49.376 --> 27:51.335
Well, don't keep me in suspense.

27:51.795 --> 27:53.379
What have you heard?

27:53.588 --> 27:57.424
Well, I heard you were handsome...

27:57.592 --> 28:00.010
...but you're just edible.

28:00.178 --> 28:02.388
What can I do for you, Dean?

28:04.599 --> 28:07.434
Maybe we should do this in my car.

28:07.602 --> 28:10.938
- Nice and private.
- Sounds good to me.

28:26.746 --> 28:29.123
- What is that stuff?
- Goofer dust.

28:29.624 --> 28:32.960
- You serious?
- Yeah. Afraid so.

28:34.212 --> 28:36.755
Look, believe me, don't believe me.
Whatever you want.

28:36.923 --> 28:40.384
Just whatever you do,
stay inside this circle, all right?

28:41.970 --> 28:45.013
- So I was hoping we could strike a deal.
- That's what I do.

28:45.890 --> 28:49.435
I want Evan Hudson released
from his contract.

28:49.644 --> 28:51.562
So sorry, darling.

28:51.730 --> 28:53.439
That's not negotiable.

28:54.065 --> 28:56.859
I'll make it worth your while.
- Oh, really?

28:57.652 --> 29:00.362
- What are you offering?
- Me.

29:02.490 --> 29:05.284
Well, well, well.

29:05.452 --> 29:08.078
You'd sacrifice your life
for someone else's?

29:09.205 --> 29:11.498
Like father, like son.

29:18.047 --> 29:19.965
That's the last of it.

29:20.717 --> 29:23.510
You did know
about your dad's deal, right?

29:23.678 --> 29:25.179
His life for yours?

29:27.223 --> 29:32.269
Now, I didn't make the deal myself,
but, boy, I wish I had.

29:37.859 --> 29:42.029
- After you.
- Such a gentleman.

29:45.241 --> 29:48.911
A devil's trap?
You've got to be kidding me.

29:49.913 --> 29:52.039
- What?
- You hear that?

29:52.207 --> 29:53.499
No. Where?

29:55.710 --> 29:57.920
Right outside the door.

30:22.278 --> 30:25.113
Just don't move, all right?
Stay where you are.

30:28.952 --> 30:31.411
You stupid, stupid-

30:31.579 --> 30:33.163
I should rip you limb from limb.

30:33.540 --> 30:35.332
Take your best shot.

30:37.502 --> 30:38.919
No.

30:39.087 --> 30:41.088
I don't think so.

30:41.256 --> 30:43.006
I won't put you out of your misery.

30:43.174 --> 30:46.093
- Yeah? Why not?
- Because your misery's the whole point.

30:46.261 --> 30:48.428
It's too much fun to watch.

30:48.596 --> 30:51.306
Knowing how your daddy died for you.

30:51.474 --> 30:53.183
How he sold his soul.

30:53.393 --> 30:55.727
I mean, that's gotta hurt.

30:58.565 --> 31:00.440
He's all you ever think about.

31:00.608 --> 31:04.528
You wake up and your first thought is,
"I can't do this anymore."

31:04.696 --> 31:06.738
You're all lit up with pain.

31:06.906 --> 31:09.116
I mean, you loved him so much.

31:09.284 --> 31:11.535
And it's all your fault.

31:13.454 --> 31:14.955
You blew it, Dean.

31:15.123 --> 31:17.958
- I could've given you what you need.
- What do I need?

31:19.836 --> 31:20.878
Your father.

31:22.672 --> 31:24.590
I could have brought him back.

31:25.592 --> 31:27.301
Your loss.

31:27.677 --> 31:31.138
See you, Dean.
I wish you a nice, long life.

31:40.899 --> 31:42.733
Hold on.

32:04.672 --> 32:06.131
Do you still hear it?

32:06.466 --> 32:07.507
No.

32:07.675 --> 32:09.217
Is it over?

32:15.642 --> 32:16.683
It's here.

32:23.149 --> 32:27.277
You're lucky I've got a soft spot
for lost puppies and long faces.

32:28.905 --> 32:31.073
I just can't leave you like this.

32:31.699 --> 32:34.993
Besides, you didn't call me here
to bargain for Evan.

32:35.536 --> 32:36.745
Not really.

32:36.913 --> 32:38.372
Can you bring him back?

32:39.123 --> 32:40.707
My dad?

32:41.084 --> 32:42.584
Of course I can.

32:42.794 --> 32:44.211
Just as he was.

32:45.213 --> 32:47.506
Your dad would live a long,
natural life...

32:47.966 --> 32:49.841
...like he was meant to.

32:50.051 --> 32:52.219
- That's a promise.
- What about me?

32:52.387 --> 32:53.971
I could give you 10 years.

32:54.138 --> 32:57.182
Ten long, good years with him.

32:57.350 --> 32:58.517
That's a lifetime.

32:58.810 --> 33:00.727
The family can be together again.

33:00.895 --> 33:03.355
John, Dean, Sammy.

33:03.523 --> 33:05.899
The Winchester boys all reunited.

33:11.072 --> 33:14.241
Look, your dad's supposed to be alive.

33:15.243 --> 33:17.285
You're supposed to be dead.

33:17.453 --> 33:19.871
This will just set things straight.

33:20.039 --> 33:22.624
Put things back in their natural order.

33:22.792 --> 33:25.711
And you get 10 extra years on top.

33:25.878 --> 33:27.254
That's a bonus.

33:36.347 --> 33:38.598
Do you think you could...

33:44.022 --> 33:46.106
...throw in a set of steak knives?

33:47.608 --> 33:51.945
You know, this smart ass,
self-defense mechanism of yours-

33:57.994 --> 33:59.036
Dean.

33:59.495 --> 34:01.204
Now you're really trapped.

34:01.914 --> 34:04.958
- That's gotta hurt.
- Let me out now.

34:05.418 --> 34:08.462
Sure. We just gotta make
a little deal here first.

34:08.795 --> 34:10.672
You call off your hellhound...

34:10.882 --> 34:12.132
...let Evan go.

34:12.800 --> 34:14.509
Then I'll let you go.

34:14.677 --> 34:16.969
I can't break a binding contract.

34:17.179 --> 34:20.514
Hm. And by "can't"
you mean, "Don't want to"?

34:21.309 --> 34:23.226
Last chance.

34:23.436 --> 34:26.313
Evan and his wife get to live
to a ripe, old age.

34:26.773 --> 34:28.815
Going, going-

34:28.983 --> 34:31.568
- Let's talk about this.
- Okay. Gone.

34:34.530 --> 34:36.072
Stay inside the circle.

34:45.750 --> 34:46.792
Come on, Dean.

34:48.753 --> 34:51.838
- What are you doing?
- You're just gonna go on a little trip.

34:53.841 --> 34:56.676
- Way down south.
- Look, forget Evan. Think of your dad.

35:23.287 --> 35:24.871
Circle's broken. Come on.

35:44.976 --> 35:46.434
Wait.

36:10.626 --> 36:13.128
- What the hell was that for?
- Sealing the deal.

36:13.296 --> 36:16.464
I usually like to be warned
before I'm violated with demon tongue.

36:16.674 --> 36:18.300
Evan Hudson is free.

36:18.676 --> 36:20.468
He and his wife will live long lives.

36:20.636 --> 36:23.221
- How do I know you're not lying?
- My word is my bond.

36:23.389 --> 36:26.975
- Oh, really?
- It is when I make a deal. It's the rules.

36:28.477 --> 36:30.270
You got what you wanted.

36:30.563 --> 36:32.022
Now let me go.

36:43.034 --> 36:45.160
You're gonna double-cross me?

36:45.328 --> 36:47.662
Funny how I'm the trustworthy one.

36:49.832 --> 36:51.416
You know...

36:51.584 --> 36:53.877
...you renege, send me to hell...

36:54.045 --> 36:57.214
...sooner or later I'm gonna climb out
and skinning Evan Hudson...

36:57.381 --> 36:59.507
...will be the first thing that I do.

37:18.819 --> 37:20.195
I gotta tell you.

37:20.363 --> 37:22.864
You would have never pulled
that stunt if you knew.

37:23.032 --> 37:25.617
- Knew what?
- Where your dad is.

37:26.160 --> 37:28.411
You should have made that deal.

37:28.579 --> 37:31.915
See, people talk about hell,
but it's just a word.

37:32.208 --> 37:34.876
It doesn't even come close
to describing the real thing.

37:35.044 --> 37:36.253
Shut your mouth, bitch.

37:36.420 --> 37:39.089
If you could see your daddy,
hear the sounds he makes...

37:39.257 --> 37:41.758
- ...because he can't even scream.
- How about I send you back?

37:51.644 --> 37:53.311
What?

37:54.021 --> 37:56.398
How did I get here?

38:11.998 --> 38:15.000
Demons lie all the time, right?
Maybe she was lying.

38:15.167 --> 38:17.961
Come on.
Is that really what you think?

38:20.047 --> 38:22.841
- How could he do it?
- He did it for you.

38:23.009 --> 38:25.343
Exactly. How am I supposed
to live with that?

38:27.388 --> 38:29.806
You know, the thought of him...

38:30.975 --> 38:32.892
...wherever he is right now-

38:33.894 --> 38:38.565
I mean, he spent his whole life
chasing that yellow-eyed son of a bitch.

38:39.358 --> 38:41.901
He should have gone out fighting.

38:43.362 --> 38:47.073
That was supposed to be his legacy,
you know?

38:48.367 --> 38:51.161
Not bargaining with the damn thing.

38:53.080 --> 38:56.833
- Not this.
- How many people did Dad save? Total?

38:57.001 --> 38:59.419
- That's not the point, Sam.
- Evan Hudson is safe...

38:59.587 --> 39:02.172
...because of what dad taught us.

39:02.590 --> 39:04.215
That's his legacy, Dean.

39:05.718 --> 39:09.554
Now we're still here, man.
So we gotta keep going.

39:09.722 --> 39:11.431
For him.

39:17.355 --> 39:18.563
- Hey, Dean?
- Yeah.

39:18.731 --> 39:21.858
When you were trapping that demon,
you weren't-

39:22.276 --> 39:24.027
I mean, it was all a trick, right?

39:24.195 --> 39:28.281
You never considered
actually making that deal, right?

39:52.056 --> 39:54.057
I swear it's not in me. It's not in me.

39:54.308 --> 39:55.767
- I swear.
- We're all gonna die.

39:56.685 --> 39:57.936
- I got no choice.
- Stop-

39:58.729 --> 40:00.980
Dean, you can't protect
your loved ones forever.

40:16.247 --> 40:17.580
Hands where I can see them.

40:17.748 --> 40:20.083
Demonic virus.
More like demonic germ warfare.

40:20.251 --> 40:21.960
Like Chuck Heston in The Omega Man.

40:22.128 --> 40:25.505
They're infected, not me.
You've known me all your life.

40:25.714 --> 40:28.299
- Please, let's go.
- No. Those things are everywhere.

40:28.509 --> 40:31.136
She bled on him. He's got the virus.

40:31.595 --> 40:34.097
I need a nationwide search.
What am I looking for?

40:34.265 --> 40:36.349
Psychics, like me.
As many as possible.

40:36.517 --> 40:39.185
The yellow-eyed man
comes to me in my dreams...

40:39.353 --> 40:41.187
...makes me do things, awful things.

40:41.355 --> 40:44.774
I had this dream where I saw
this guy get stabbed in a parking lot.

40:44.942 --> 40:46.985
- He has plans for me.
- What kind of plans?

40:47.820 --> 40:50.238
Last night, I saw you die.

40:52.867 --> 40:56.870
Right before Dad died,
he told me something.

40:59.039 --> 41:00.623
He told me something about you.

41:02.042 --> 41:04.377
Dean, what did he tell you?

41:05.305 --> 41:11.732
