Elena!

Oh, hi, Marzel.

01:12.322 --> 01:13.574
What's going on?

01:13.657 --> 01:16.493
Well, today is
Día de los Muertos,

01:16.577 --> 01:19.162
the day we honor
our loved ones
who have passed away.

01:19.246 --> 01:20.789
-[band playing]
-Oh!

01:21.874 --> 01:23.667
By throwing a party?

01:23.750 --> 01:24.960
Not exactly.

01:25.043 --> 01:27.045
We celebrate their memory
by building altars

01:27.129 --> 01:29.173
and decorating them
with their favorite things.

01:29.256 --> 01:33.051
And in Nueva Vista,
we float the altars
out to sea.

01:33.135 --> 01:35.053
Looks like I'm going
to have dinner for weeks.

01:35.137 --> 01:36.221
Marzel!

01:36.305 --> 01:39.391
I meant, that's a beautiful
custom.

01:43.896 --> 01:45.898
Are those your parents?

01:45.981 --> 01:47.524
Cherries were Papi's
favorite.

01:47.608 --> 01:49.109
And Mami loved
sweet bread.

01:49.193 --> 01:51.528
Mijita, have you seen
your abuelo?

01:51.612 --> 01:53.238
He hasn't been here
all morning.

01:53.322 --> 01:54.823
No, I haven't.

01:58.452 --> 02:00.329
But I think I know
where to find him.

02:02.998 --> 02:04.917
[grumbling]

02:05.000 --> 02:07.461
Abuelo, you shouldn't
be carrying so much.

02:07.544 --> 02:11.340
Elena, I may be old,
but I am not incapable.

02:11.423 --> 02:14.635
I know, but our altar
is way down the beach.

02:14.718 --> 02:16.470
This is for
a different altar.

02:16.553 --> 02:17.804
[grunts]

02:26.605 --> 02:27.606
Who are these men?

02:27.689 --> 02:31.860
[Francisco] Dear friends
I lost many years ago
in a shipwreck.

02:31.944 --> 02:32.945
Uh-oh.

02:33.028 --> 02:35.239
No, it was not
the <i>sirenas' </i>fault.

02:35.489 --> 02:37.658
-Whew!
-It was mine.

02:40.994 --> 02:42.496
Yours?

02:42.579 --> 02:44.581
What are you
talking about?

02:45.541 --> 02:46.667
[sighs]

02:46.750 --> 02:48.335
It was a clear day.

02:49.753 --> 02:52.464
<i>I was steering the ship</i>
<i>with my two friends aboard.</i>

02:52.548 --> 02:54.007
-[loud banging and crashing]
-[yelping]

02:55.217 --> 02:56.885
<i>Then, out of nowhere,</i>

02:56.969 --> 02:59.471
<i>the ship just capsized.</i>

02:59.555 --> 03:00.889
[sighs]

03:00.973 --> 03:03.141
I had no idea what hit us.

03:04.977 --> 03:06.728
I was the only survivor.

03:07.896 --> 03:09.064
Oh, Abuelo.

03:10.107 --> 03:11.483
[El Guerrero]
Oh, por favor.

03:11.567 --> 03:12.776
[gasps]

03:12.860 --> 03:16.321
Someone get him a mop
for all those tears.

03:16.405 --> 03:17.990
Well, I think
it is beautiful

03:18.073 --> 03:19.992
when a man can say
how he feels.

03:20.200 --> 03:22.536
Aye, forget your feelings.

03:22.619 --> 03:25.664
I wish I could feel
this pan de muerto.

03:26.248 --> 03:29.751
Uh, Abuelo,
your friends are here.

03:29.835 --> 03:32.087
Yes, they are in
my heart.

03:32.171 --> 03:33.964
Yeah, they're also
behind your back.

03:34.047 --> 03:36.425
What? You can see us?

03:36.508 --> 03:38.343
<i>Increíble.</i>

03:38.427 --> 03:40.304
Um...Elena?

03:40.387 --> 03:43.932
Right, I probably should have
told you this before, but...

03:44.766 --> 03:46.393
I have the ability
to see ghosts

03:46.476 --> 03:47.728
on Día de los Muertos.

03:47.811 --> 03:48.812
[laughs]

03:48.896 --> 03:50.189
She's joking, right?

03:50.272 --> 03:52.733
I hope so.

03:52.816 --> 03:55.152
Aw! He doesn't
believe her.

03:55.235 --> 04:00.199
Oh, he will when you tell him
El Guerrero says hello.

04:00.282 --> 04:02.201
And El Místico.

04:02.284 --> 04:06.663
Uh, El Guerrero
and El Místico say hi.

04:06.955 --> 04:08.040
How did you...?

04:08.123 --> 04:10.375
Nobody knows their code names.

04:10.459 --> 04:12.127
-Code names?
-[gasps]

04:12.211 --> 04:14.171
They really are here.

04:14.254 --> 04:16.298
I have missed you, amigos.

04:16.381 --> 04:17.382
They're over there.

04:17.633 --> 04:19.927
And we have missed you,
El Capitán.

04:20.010 --> 04:21.762
-El Capitán?
-Hmm.

04:21.845 --> 04:25.474
It has been a long time
since anyone called me that.

04:25.557 --> 04:27.893
Wait, what did you need
a code name for?

04:27.976 --> 04:30.521
It's a secret I have kept
for many years.

04:30.604 --> 04:33.482
But you should know
the truth about...

07:01.421 --> 07:03.423
Until that last mission.

07:03.507 --> 07:04.591
What was the mission?

07:04.675 --> 07:06.552
To find a powerful
magic shield

07:06.635 --> 07:09.388
before the Macoco.

07:09.471 --> 07:10.472
The who-what-co?

07:10.556 --> 07:11.640
I heard stories of the Macoco.

07:11.723 --> 07:15.477
He's an ocean beast who tried
to attack Avalor years ago.

07:15.561 --> 07:17.145
The Royal Wizard
used magic

07:17.229 --> 07:19.147
to send him back
into the ocean.

07:19.231 --> 07:21.108
But then the Macoco
began searching

07:21.191 --> 07:24.695
for a legendary shield
that could block all magic.

07:24.778 --> 07:26.446
El Escudo.

07:27.281 --> 07:29.283
El Místico found a map
to the island

07:29.366 --> 07:30.993
where the shield
was hidden.

07:31.743 --> 07:34.329
But our ship
sank on the way.

07:34.413 --> 07:37.499
It was the only mission
Los Tres never completed.

07:40.127 --> 07:43.547
But wait, Los Tres
are back together...sort of.

07:43.630 --> 07:45.007
We could complete
the mission today.

07:45.090 --> 07:48.552
The Macoco must still be
out there, searching.

07:48.635 --> 07:51.597
But with your help, Elena,
we could secure the shield

07:51.680 --> 07:55.184
and make sure Avalor
is safe forever.

07:55.267 --> 07:56.768
What are they saying?

07:56.852 --> 08:00.063
Uh, they want to complete
the mission.

08:00.147 --> 08:04.526
Oh, what better way to honor
the memory of my old friends.

08:04.610 --> 08:06.862
And make up
for past mistakes.

08:06.945 --> 08:08.864
But everyone's
waiting for us.

08:08.947 --> 08:10.741
Well, we will tell them
we are picking up

08:10.824 --> 08:12.576
something special
for the altars.

08:12.659 --> 08:13.911
[sighs]

08:15.204 --> 08:17.164
We need you, Elena.

08:17.247 --> 08:19.791
Only you can see
my friends.

08:19.875 --> 08:22.878
Will you help Los Tres
complete our final mission?

08:22.961 --> 08:23.962
[laughs]

08:24.046 --> 08:25.714
-You must.
<i>-Por favor.</i>

08:26.673 --> 08:27.758
[sighs]

08:27.841 --> 08:29.843
Okay, I will.

08:29.927 --> 08:32.346
-Ha-ha!
- Viva Los Tres!

08:32.429 --> 08:34.556
Please promise
you'll be careful, Abuelo.

08:34.640 --> 08:36.934
Of course, mijita.

08:37.017 --> 08:39.311
[grunts]

08:39.895 --> 08:41.605
[Elena]
That is not being careful.

08:44.066 --> 08:46.193
You're too old to be
leaping around like this.

08:46.276 --> 08:48.695
I am just a little
out of practice.

08:50.572 --> 08:51.865
He'll be fine.

08:56.578 --> 08:58.539
Okay, so what's the plan?

08:58.622 --> 09:01.375
Well, there is a hidden map
in our old ship

09:01.458 --> 09:04.378
which shows the exact location
of the shield.

09:04.461 --> 09:06.338
But your ship sank.

09:06.421 --> 09:09.299
How are we going to find it?
It could be anywhere.

09:09.383 --> 09:11.218
I know every shipwreck
in these waters.

09:11.301 --> 09:12.386
What did yours looks like?

09:12.469 --> 09:13.595
It was a schooner.

09:13.679 --> 09:16.598
And it waved a flag with
the Los Tres mask.

09:16.682 --> 09:18.725
I've seen that one.
It's not too far.

09:18.809 --> 09:22.104
-Follow me.
-[water splashes]

09:23.564 --> 09:25.774
-He's a <i>sirena?</i>
-They're our friends now.

09:25.858 --> 09:27.651
What?

09:27.734 --> 09:30.529
What else has changed
in Avalor since we passed on?

09:30.612 --> 09:33.866
Well, besides the color
of El Capitán's hair?

09:33.949 --> 09:35.242
[both laugh]

09:36.201 --> 09:37.578
[El Guerrero]
Oh, that guy's funny.

09:42.749 --> 09:45.586
It's just ahead,
about a hundred fins down.

09:46.378 --> 09:47.713
Want me to try
and find the map?

09:47.796 --> 09:49.464
-No.
-Yes.

09:49.548 --> 09:52.885
Thank you, Marzel,
but this is
a job for Los Tres.

09:52.968 --> 09:55.929
Okay. Well, good luck
with the mission.

09:56.013 --> 09:57.222
Viva Los Tres!

09:59.975 --> 10:01.768
Now, to get that map.

10:01.852 --> 10:03.770
Wait, you're not
seriously thinking

10:03.854 --> 10:05.689
of diving down there
yourself, are you?

10:05.772 --> 10:08.233
-Of course I am.
-But it's too deep.

10:08.317 --> 10:11.695
I once held my breath
over 20 minutes.

10:11.778 --> 10:12.905
It is true.

10:12.988 --> 10:14.615
While wrestling a shark.

10:14.698 --> 10:17.075
-Also true.
-During a typhoon.

10:17.451 --> 10:19.828
Okay, but that was
a long time ago.

10:19.912 --> 10:22.497
And I can breathe
underwater with my magic kelp.

10:22.581 --> 10:23.582
I'll go get it.

10:26.210 --> 10:27.586
Why didn't you stop him?

10:27.669 --> 10:29.880
We're ghosts.
We can't stop anyone.

10:31.089 --> 10:32.341
I'm going after him.

10:38.847 --> 10:40.015
I'm coming, Abuelo.

10:40.098 --> 10:41.475
[splashes]

10:41.558 --> 10:42.976
She's as stubborn
as a mule.

10:43.060 --> 10:46.146
Hmm. You know who
she reminds me of?

10:46.230 --> 10:47.314
-Luisa.
-Luisa.

10:49.650 --> 10:51.026
-Hola, again.
-[gasps]

10:51.109 --> 10:52.110
You scared me.

10:52.194 --> 10:54.279
Not as much
as you're scaring us.

10:54.363 --> 10:56.323
Don't you think that you might
be overreacting

10:56.406 --> 10:57.449
just a little bit?

10:57.533 --> 10:58.825
Or a big bit.

10:59.076 --> 11:00.827
No.

11:06.875 --> 11:09.378

-Of course he did.

11:09.461 --> 11:12.089
He is El Capitán.

11:12.172 --> 11:13.215

11:16.635 --> 11:17.636
I've got you.

11:27.396 --> 11:30.858
[both chuckling]

11:36.238 --> 11:37.906
Why did you come
down there?

11:37.990 --> 11:39.825
I was afraid you might
run out of breath.

11:39.908 --> 11:42.119
I was doing fine.
I got the map.

11:42.202 --> 11:44.872
Which I am
trying to read.

11:46.206 --> 11:47.749
-Here.
-Ha-ha!

11:48.250 --> 11:51.420
The shield is in a cave
on this deserted island.

11:51.503 --> 11:52.504
The shield is here.

11:53.422 --> 11:55.007
We'll be there
in no time.

11:55.090 --> 11:56.925
-Anchors aweigh.
-I'll get it.

11:58.427 --> 12:00.345
[sighs]

12:08.437 --> 12:11.440
I told you after we wasted
all those years

12:11.523 --> 12:12.858
searching
for that shield,

12:12.941 --> 12:15.027
if we just hunkered
down here and waited,

12:15.110 --> 12:16.945
someone would come back
for the map.

12:17.029 --> 12:18.030
Did I not tell you that?

12:18.113 --> 12:19.615
Yeah, but where was it?

12:19.698 --> 12:21.074
We looked everywhere, man.

12:21.158 --> 12:25.329
The hull, the cabins,
the deck, the cabins again.

12:25.412 --> 12:27.206
-Ow!
-Enough!

12:27.289 --> 12:29.625
What difference does it make
where it was?

12:29.708 --> 12:31.835
They got it, and now
they're going to lead us

12:31.919 --> 12:33.378
straight to the shield.`

12:33.462 --> 12:35.631
-Ow!
-Ha! How does it feel?

12:35.714 --> 12:37.424
Two can play that game.

12:37.508 --> 12:41.094
So don't be swatting me unless
you want to get swatted back,

12:41.178 --> 12:42.513
because I will-- ow!

12:42.596 --> 12:44.556
Can we go now?
Before we lose them?

12:44.640 --> 12:46.475
-No.
-Ow!

12:46.558 --> 12:47.809
Now we can go.

12:47.893 --> 12:48.894

13:14.711 --> 13:15.838
There was a rustling.

13:15.921 --> 13:17.506
Uh...I didn't hear anything.

13:18.632 --> 13:20.175
I'm going to scout
the area.

13:20.259 --> 13:21.301
Abuelo.

13:21.468 --> 13:22.970
It was probably
just the wind, and--

13:23.053 --> 13:27.474
And I may fall and break
my frail, old bones?

13:27.558 --> 13:28.976
Exactly.

13:29.059 --> 13:30.727
Maybe El Capitán
could've climbed that tree,

13:30.811 --> 13:32.354
but you're not him anymore.

13:32.437 --> 13:33.564
You're just Abuelo.

13:33.939 --> 13:36.275
Plus, we're this close
to completing

13:36.358 --> 13:38.277
the last mission of Los Tres.

13:38.527 --> 13:39.528
Let's finish it.

This is the place.

14:04.970 --> 14:06.471
We are going to need
a torch.

14:06.555 --> 14:09.391
I will gather dry wood,
find some flint, and--

I'll search the walls.
