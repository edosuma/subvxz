WEBVTT

00:01.234 --> 00:01.434
.

00:06.973 --> 00:10.477
We're back and things are
about to get fucking naughty.

00:11.277 --> 00:12.679
(screaming)

00:12.746 --> 00:16.082
It's going to be bigger
than ever before.

00:16.149 --> 00:17.150
Cheers!

00:18.151 --> 00:19.986
More kissing.

00:20.053 --> 00:21.287
Getting fucked up.

00:22.455 --> 00:25.291
Arguing.
(shouting)

00:26.493 --> 00:28.128
Tears.

00:29.129 --> 00:30.797
Bring it on.

00:31.865 --> 00:34.401
Bonjour, Paris,
Geordies have arrived.

00:35.969 --> 00:38.238
I am slightly drunker than usual.

00:38.304 --> 00:40.607
Je m'appelle Vicky.

00:40.673 --> 00:42.876
This isn't going very well at all.

00:44.077 --> 00:46.679
There is no chance
I am allowing Charlotte

00:46.746 --> 00:48.882
to go anywhere near Gary tonight.

00:48.948 --> 00:52.185
Me and Gary are just friends.
I'm not doing anything wrong.

00:52.252 --> 00:54.821
(sobs)

00:54.888 --> 00:57.824
Shit, it's Marnie.
I hope things don't kick off again.

00:57.891 --> 01:01.528
I'm sorry for kissing Kyle.
Wrapped around my little finger.

01:03.329 --> 01:07.934
I need to leave. I need to speak to
Mitch and get this sorted out.

01:11.905 --> 01:14.174
I should have a degree
in pulling women.

01:14.240 --> 01:16.376
I am a Geordie girl
with a VIP edge.

01:16.443 --> 01:18.978
I'm a natural beauty,
real boobs, real hair.

01:19.045 --> 01:21.281
I'm gonna tear the place up.

01:21.347 --> 01:23.483
I never kiss anyone
without a six pack.

01:23.550 --> 01:25.485
Hardest graft I've done is me hair.

01:25.552 --> 01:27.253
Colourful, full of mischief.

01:27.320 --> 01:29.088
Fit, flirty
and I've got double Fs.

01:29.155 --> 01:31.491
I'm gonna make sparks fly.

01:31.558 --> 01:34.427
(all) Geordie Shore, why-aye!

01:45.705 --> 01:49.108
I can't actually believe
Charlotte left last night.

01:50.443 --> 01:54.781
Yeah, I'm glad she's going to go and
finally know where her head's at.

01:54.848 --> 01:58.384
Charlotte's gone to see Mitch
to resolve the issues they have.

01:58.451 --> 02:00.086
I hope she comes back happy.

02:01.688 --> 02:02.789
Oh, God, yeah.

02:02.856 --> 02:05.658
Erm, well...
Let us guess.

02:05.725 --> 02:08.261
It was absolutely fine.
You're forgiven.

02:08.328 --> 02:11.131
Yeah. Oh, fucking hell,
blow me over with a feather.

02:11.197 --> 02:13.666
Aaron's forgiven Marnie, shock(!)

02:13.733 --> 02:17.003
That's because he's a fanny
and she's a bewitching she-devil.

02:19.973 --> 02:21.241
He just can't help it.

02:25.912 --> 02:28.281
Eurgh. You fucking man.
Don't say... Eurgh.

02:28.348 --> 02:30.483
I take it back,
you don't have a vagina.

02:30.550 --> 02:33.086
Last night,
me and Aaron sorted everything out.

02:33.152 --> 02:35.121
I didn't expect it to be so quick,

02:35.188 --> 02:37.624
but he took responsibility
and so did I.

02:41.327 --> 02:44.464
So, where do you stand
with Marnie now?

02:44.531 --> 02:46.699
What did she say?

02:46.766 --> 02:49.769
She was like, "I'm sorry."
But I apologised because

02:49.836 --> 02:54.107
obviously I invited the girl, so...

02:54.173 --> 02:55.575
We're both in the wrong.

02:55.642 --> 02:59.746
Aaron's telling we that he's OK
with Marnie after one little chat.

02:59.812 --> 03:01.981
After all that shit
I put up with in Paris.

03:02.048 --> 03:03.316
What a fucking mug.

03:08.755 --> 03:11.424
I like Marnie,
but there's so much chaos with her,

03:11.491 --> 03:14.727
I don't know if I can cope with it.
But never say never.

03:14.794 --> 03:17.764
(phone rings)
(James) Phone!

03:17.830 --> 03:19.499
It's blatantly gonna be Anna.

03:19.566 --> 03:22.502
First time anyone's heard from her
since before Paris.

03:22.569 --> 03:26.272
I wouldn't like to be Vicky's ear
cos I bet it's getting chewed off.

03:30.610 --> 03:32.779
What? That's preposterous.

03:32.845 --> 03:36.649
Shit, someone's grassed us to Anna
about being pissed in Paris.

03:36.716 --> 03:39.319
I bet it was Gaz.
The brown-nosing bellend.

03:40.787 --> 03:41.854
Sorry, Anna.

03:44.891 --> 03:45.959
OK. Hit us.

03:48.394 --> 03:49.395
OK.

03:51.464 --> 03:52.465
Oh, God.

03:55.602 --> 03:57.170
It might be my fault,

03:57.236 --> 04:01.507
but I am getting everyone involved
because misery loves company.

04:01.574 --> 04:03.042
(James) What's the craic?

04:03.109 --> 04:05.645
Well, I'm in trouble.
You are? For Paris?

04:05.712 --> 04:08.348
She's got a job on for we tonight.

04:09.616 --> 04:11.784
She's got a Japanese event tomorrow

04:11.851 --> 04:17.156
and she needs 200 origami birds
made by then.

04:17.223 --> 04:21.327
What the fuck is origami? Can barely
pronounce it, never mind do it.

04:21.394 --> 04:23.329
Are you fucking kidding?
No.

04:23.396 --> 04:24.931
This is a pure liberty, this.

04:24.998 --> 04:28.868
Don't get me wrong, I love folding
birds but not of the paper variety.

04:28.935 --> 04:31.604
Gotta make roughly 20-25 each.

04:31.671 --> 04:33.640
I can't read that.

04:33.706 --> 04:37.176
Fold in half then open,
then fold in half the other way.

04:37.243 --> 04:40.647
This is more difficult
than I initially anticipated.

04:40.713 --> 04:44.751
I know these brain-dead imbeciles
are not gonna be able to do this.

04:47.987 --> 04:49.022
Oh, man!

04:49.088 --> 04:52.458
The top three corners?
Fuck this.

04:52.525 --> 04:54.360
What?!

04:54.427 --> 04:56.863
Fucking not a chance in hell.

04:56.929 --> 05:00.066
Vicky getting too drunk means
we've gotta make 200 birds

05:00.133 --> 05:01.534
to save her job. Fuck off.

05:01.601 --> 05:04.003
Balls.

05:04.070 --> 05:07.173
(James) We're absolutely useless
at making paper birds.

05:07.240 --> 05:09.475
What's next, fucking brain surgery?

05:10.343 --> 05:12.679
I'm not doing it.
Marns, you're doing it.

05:12.745 --> 05:16.916
I refuse. Fucking get back to making
paper seagulls, you lazy cow.

05:16.983 --> 05:18.618
Paper birds are fucking shit.

05:18.685 --> 05:21.888
I don't want to be doing this
for anyone, never mind Vicky.

05:21.954 --> 05:23.456
She's a shit boss anyways.

05:23.523 --> 05:26.659
Gotta have patience.
I don't have any. Get some, kid.

05:26.726 --> 05:29.996
Look, Marnie,
I'll show you how to do it.

05:30.930 --> 05:32.498
He's done it!
Know what it is?

05:32.565 --> 05:35.168
Just read the fucking bit of paper,
fucking easy.

05:35.234 --> 05:38.037
And I can't even read. (laughs)

05:42.041 --> 05:43.643
I hope Charlotte's OK, like.

05:43.710 --> 05:47.146
No matter what's happened, I think
it'll be so nice for her to have

05:47.213 --> 05:48.548
some sort of resolution.

05:48.614 --> 05:52.285
She was completely in limbo before,
she didn't know where she stood.

05:52.351 --> 05:55.855
I don't know if Charlotte's gonna
sort things out or split up.

05:55.922 --> 05:59.325
Hopefully we'll find out what's
going on between her and Mitch.

06:10.703 --> 06:12.839
Hi, everyone.
Oh, my God. Hi, babe.

06:12.905 --> 06:13.940
How are yous?

06:14.006 --> 06:16.809
I'm so excited to get back
into the house.

06:16.876 --> 06:19.145
I know the girls are gonna be
so supportive

06:19.212 --> 06:22.849
and I need that bunch around us
to take me mind off everything.

06:22.915 --> 06:24.484
Fucking hell, how are you?

06:25.351 --> 06:27.453
We're finished.
What?!

06:27.520 --> 06:28.688
You're joking!

06:29.655 --> 06:32.658
Charlotte's just rocked back in
and she's telling we all

06:32.725 --> 06:35.528
that she's broke up with Mitch.
This is big, big news.

06:35.595 --> 06:37.730
Fucking hell.

06:37.797 --> 06:40.099
I'm single and I'm scared.

06:40.166 --> 06:43.002
I know it's gonna be hard
and I'm gonna have good days

06:43.069 --> 06:44.971
and I'm gonna have really bad days

06:45.037 --> 06:48.841
because I truly feel in me heart
of hearts that this is over now.

06:48.908 --> 06:50.209
How are you?

06:52.011 --> 06:55.448
Charlotte and Mitch have finished.
I can't actually believe it.

06:55.515 --> 06:57.083
I thought he'd fight for her.

06:57.150 --> 06:59.786
Are you OK? I'll be all right
now I'm in here again.

06:59.852 --> 07:01.521
So, what happened?

07:01.587 --> 07:04.824
I text him when I got out saying,
"I think we need to talk."

07:04.891 --> 07:06.025
He text back saying,

07:06.092 --> 07:09.762
"I'll save you the bother and
I'll cut the bullshit, we're over."

07:09.829 --> 07:11.597
It's so upsetting the fact that

07:11.664 --> 07:15.501
I went out of my way to leave
the house and try and speak to him,

07:15.568 --> 07:18.471
but he just seemed like
he couldn't be bothered at all.

07:23.242 --> 07:25.778
Next few days are gonna be
tough for Charlotte,

07:25.845 --> 07:29.081
but I'll be here for her
and so will her Geordie Shore family.

07:30.716 --> 07:31.851
So, are we going out?

07:31.918 --> 07:34.020
We only get to go out
when these are done.

07:34.086 --> 07:35.421
Are you fucking kidding?

07:35.488 --> 07:36.589
For fuck's sake!

07:36.656 --> 07:41.093
I wanted to leave the misery behind
and walk back into the party house,

07:41.160 --> 07:45.131
but what I've walked into is a load
of misos folding bits of paper.

07:45.198 --> 07:46.199
What the fuck?

07:46.265 --> 07:50.002
What? I hate this.
It's OK, everyone does, it's shit.

07:51.504 --> 07:53.806
Fuck it, let's all just go out.
Shall we?

07:55.241 --> 07:57.944
Charlotte's single
and we need to cheer her up.

07:58.010 --> 08:02.181
So that means one thing, fucking off
these birds and everyone going out.

08:02.248 --> 08:04.550
That's it. I'm sacked.

08:16.562 --> 08:19.265
I'm not having anyone stay in
tonight.

08:19.332 --> 08:21.467
It's me first night
as single Charlotte

08:21.534 --> 08:25.238
and I want everyone around us,
so that I don't cry.

08:28.774 --> 08:32.144
Don't get sad.
You don't wanna be with him anyway.

08:32.211 --> 08:35.047
I feel sad that I put so much effort

08:35.114 --> 08:39.784
into a relationship that lasted so
long for it just to end like this.

08:39.852 --> 08:42.388
Why did I waste all of that time,

08:42.455 --> 08:45.558
all of that effort
and all of them emotions?

08:50.630 --> 08:54.166
You're back in here with us.
We're gonna look after you.

08:54.233 --> 08:55.902
You don't need to be sad.

08:55.968 --> 08:57.904
I feel so sorry for Charlotte.

08:57.970 --> 09:00.239
I know she's upset
and I know she's hurting,

09:00.306 --> 09:03.175
but I'm her best friend
and I know she can be strong.

09:03.242 --> 09:06.245
Do you know the best way
to get over someone?

09:06.312 --> 09:10.850
Don't even say to get under
another person, I feel sick.

09:14.654 --> 09:17.156
Come on then.

09:17.223 --> 09:18.691
(cheering)

09:21.994 --> 09:23.729
Let's fucking do this!

09:24.630 --> 09:27.600
Charlotte in a relationship
was average at best

09:27.667 --> 09:32.638
but single Charlotte,
she is where the party's at!

09:32.705 --> 09:37.777
There's only one way
to deal with this. Let's get mortal.

09:37.843 --> 09:40.846
Shit, there could still
be something there between we.

09:40.913 --> 09:43.783
Charlotte's all over Gary
like a cheap suit.

09:43.849 --> 09:46.886
No.
You brush mine, I'll brush yours.

09:48.187 --> 09:50.456
What the fuck is going on?

09:50.523 --> 09:52.959
(all) Geordie Shore, why-aye!

09:55.294 --> 09:55.494
.

09:57.997 --> 09:58.197
.

10:10.910 --> 10:14.547
We are all in Bijoux and we're
all ready to have a mint night.

10:16.082 --> 10:19.185
I wanna get mortal.
I want to get fucked up.

10:19.251 --> 10:21.520
Everyone knows
the main thing you need

10:21.587 --> 10:24.190
when you've broken up with someone.
Shots.

10:29.295 --> 10:31.130
This is gonna be a messy night.

10:41.774 --> 10:45.211
I don't know what it is about
Marnie, no matter how much we argue,

10:45.277 --> 10:48.547
she pulls us back and I hate
that she can do that to us.

10:58.090 --> 11:01.193
Fighting is their fucking foreplay,
weirdos.

11:08.267 --> 11:10.536
Charlotte seems so much happier now.

11:10.603 --> 11:12.805
Drinking a bottle of wine
with a straw.

11:12.872 --> 11:15.174
I love single Charlotte already.

11:23.082 --> 11:26.719
Marnie is telling us that
I already seem a lot happier.

11:26.786 --> 11:30.556
Maybe I'm better at being single
than what I thought.

11:36.562 --> 11:39.732
I haven't seen Charlotte
have this much fun in ages.

11:39.799 --> 11:42.601
She'll be back to pissing herself
in no time.

11:53.446 --> 11:56.148
It's nice that me and Gary
are getting close again

11:56.215 --> 11:58.684
and that we're friends
and we can sit together,

11:58.751 --> 12:00.920
have a laugh, talk to each other.

12:13.199 --> 12:16.502
After everything in Paris,
Charlotte split up with Mitch,

12:16.569 --> 12:20.873
I'm starting to think shit, there
could still be something between we.

12:32.785 --> 12:36.522
I'll always be close to Gary
and he is so special to us

12:36.589 --> 12:40.359
and I'm worried that it's going to
be difficult for us to stay away.

12:52.104 --> 12:56.108
Everyone's mortal. Time to go home.
It's been the best night ever.

13:07.920 --> 13:09.455
Whoo! Yeah!

13:12.191 --> 13:16.061
We all get back to the house
and we're absolutely mortal.

13:16.128 --> 13:17.796
(laughs)

13:17.863 --> 13:20.566
Playing basketball.
Watch the birds, please, no!

13:20.633 --> 13:22.568
The birds can fucking suck me dick.

13:24.603 --> 13:27.873
Me first single night out
has went amazing.

13:30.176 --> 13:31.310
Everybody!

13:38.050 --> 13:40.119
(laughs)

13:40.186 --> 13:41.921
Charlotte's first night back

13:41.987 --> 13:44.490
and she's all over Gary
like a cheap suit.

13:44.557 --> 13:48.060
She looks like such a smitten kitten,
instantly I smell trouble.

13:48.127 --> 13:51.030
I want another one,
I want another one!

13:54.266 --> 13:58.504
Me and Gary have not been close
for a year and a half,

13:58.571 --> 14:01.540
and now all of a sudden
it's like nothing's even changed.

14:01.607 --> 14:03.976
It's like
it's always been like this.

14:04.043 --> 14:05.044
What the fuck?

14:07.479 --> 14:09.081
Turn this way.
No.

14:09.148 --> 14:12.518
Charlotte's just single, I
thought we'd have a laugh together,

14:12.585 --> 14:15.321
do some fun stuff
and eventually start flirting.

14:15.387 --> 14:20.226
I did not think it would be happening
six hours after she became single.

14:25.364 --> 14:29.101
I think I'm getting a bit carried
away. I need to rein meself in.

14:29.168 --> 14:30.970
What the fuck is going on?

14:38.010 --> 14:40.412
Charlotte and Gary
are all over each other.

14:40.479 --> 14:42.648
This is only gonna go
one way tonight.

14:45.484 --> 14:47.820
I need to remove meself
from the situation.

14:47.886 --> 14:51.624
Go for a piss, brush my teeth,
but no, here comes Charlotte.

14:51.690 --> 14:53.292
I am brushing my teeth!

14:56.328 --> 14:59.198
You're not brushing...
Yes, I am!

14:59.265 --> 15:03.335
I feel like now I'm single, all
I'll do is follow Gary everywhere.

15:03.402 --> 15:05.938
But I'm gonna pretend
I'm brushing me teeth.

15:06.005 --> 15:07.439
He'll never know.

15:14.146 --> 15:16.749
No.
You brush mine, I'll brush yours.

15:18.751 --> 15:22.021
Me and Gary are brushing
each other's teeth.

15:22.087 --> 15:24.990
This is so romantic.

15:29.028 --> 15:30.095
What?

15:34.400 --> 15:35.934
Done?

15:45.010 --> 15:48.147
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

15:50.916 --> 15:53.786
I'm actually kissing Charlotte.

15:53.852 --> 15:56.922
I feel like I've gone back in time.
I kind of like it.

16:02.294 --> 16:05.397
Me and Gary have got so much history

16:05.464 --> 16:09.301
and now that I'm single,
I can't help but just look at him

16:09.368 --> 16:14.106
and want to go there because it's
familiar and I really like it.

16:28.120 --> 16:30.856
I'm not gonna stand in the way of
Charlotte and Gary,

16:30.923 --> 16:32.958
but jumping into his bed?

16:33.025 --> 16:35.728
Howay, man, Char,
is this not a bit too soon?

16:40.866 --> 16:42.901
You won't? You won't cry?

16:42.968 --> 16:44.937
You're not gonna whinge?
I won't, no.

16:45.003 --> 16:47.906
You'll think this is
an excellent idea? Excellent.

16:47.973 --> 16:48.974
Crack on.

16:49.875 --> 16:53.245
I don't need saving, Vicky,
I'm single. Just let us enjoy it.

16:53.312 --> 16:54.313
I'm having fun.

17:01.086 --> 17:05.656
Me and Charlotte back in bed,
necking on.

17:05.723 --> 17:07.326
Never seen that coming.

17:12.964 --> 17:17.269
I'm enjoying being in Gary's bed
and it just feels so natural.

17:17.336 --> 17:19.838
It feels like
I've never been away from him.

17:26.211 --> 17:28.146
(giggles)

17:28.213 --> 17:30.749
What am I doing here?

17:31.784 --> 17:33.085
(both) No!

17:33.152 --> 17:36.255
I do not want to watch Scott
and Marnie all over each other.

17:36.321 --> 17:39.925
If looks could kill, Marnie and Scott
would be six feet under.

17:39.992 --> 17:42.594
(all) Geordie Shore, why-aye!

17:44.763 --> 17:44.963
.

17:47.466 --> 17:47.666
.

18:06.518 --> 18:09.421
Good morning, Mrs.

18:09.488 --> 18:11.690
So, I've woken up and I'm by meself.

18:11.757 --> 18:14.626
I'm thinking
where the hell could Charlotte be?

18:14.693 --> 18:17.029
Oh, yeah, I know,
in bed with Gary.

18:17.095 --> 18:19.965
She promised she'd think
it was a good idea today.

18:20.032 --> 18:22.201
She will not think that today.

18:22.267 --> 18:24.703
What the fuck? I'm actually shocked.

18:24.770 --> 18:26.839
I didn't think she'd dive in
this quick.

18:28.440 --> 18:32.444
Fucking hell. Can't believe
DJ Charles slept in the room.

18:32.511 --> 18:38.050
Oh, no! What am I doing here?

18:38.116 --> 18:40.486
This is the worst day of my life.

18:41.920 --> 18:44.756
Cheers for making us feel special,
Char.

18:44.823 --> 18:47.626
Oh, Charl.
This is bad.

18:47.693 --> 18:51.396
Charlotte looks devastated. You knew
it was gonna fucking happen.

18:51.463 --> 18:53.532
(both sigh)

18:54.867 --> 18:56.301
(both) No.

18:56.368 --> 18:58.637
Nothing bad happened,
we didn't have sex.

18:58.704 --> 19:01.573
We just slept together naked,
like twins in a womb.

19:02.374 --> 19:03.976
See? That's not too bad.

19:04.042 --> 19:07.379
What's going on there, like?
Kids, marriage, you know.

19:07.446 --> 19:08.514
(laughs)

19:14.520 --> 19:16.855
I am dreading seeing the girls.

19:16.922 --> 19:18.757
This is like Judgement Day.

19:22.027 --> 19:23.662
Morning.
Hi, girls.

19:23.729 --> 19:25.998
No wonder
Charlotte's looking sheepish.

19:26.064 --> 19:29.501
She's just got out of Gary's bed.
Of course we're gonna judge her.

19:29.568 --> 19:30.802
It's what we do.

19:32.471 --> 19:36.408
(sighs) I don't know what to say.
What did you do?

19:36.475 --> 19:39.144
So, we were brushing
each other's teeth.

19:39.211 --> 19:41.747
Mm, sexy(!) I understand
how it just happened.

19:41.813 --> 19:43.282
Is this foreplay now?

19:43.348 --> 19:45.050
And then we started to kiss.

19:45.117 --> 19:46.318
Fucking weirdos.

19:46.385 --> 19:49.621
Brushing each other's teeth
as some sort of kinky foreplay.

19:49.688 --> 19:52.224
Charlotte didn't bring
a fucking toothbrush,

19:52.291 --> 19:54.927
so it better not have been mine,
the scruffy bitch.

19:56.895 --> 19:58.730
How do you feel about that?

20:00.432 --> 20:03.001
I've been trying
not to think about it.

20:04.369 --> 20:06.638
How's that going so far?
Not very well.

20:10.375 --> 20:11.643
(laughter)

20:11.710 --> 20:14.079
She saying she's not gonna
go there again...

20:14.146 --> 20:16.214
OK, Charlotte, we all believe you.

20:17.215 --> 20:20.085
"Me and Gary are just friends."
(laughter)

20:20.152 --> 20:23.121
Wish I had a paper bird
for every time I'd heard that.

20:27.392 --> 20:31.730
Last night, none of us attempted
to do any of them stupid birds.

20:31.797 --> 20:35.300
Vicky's trying to make us
do these when we're hung over.

20:35.367 --> 20:37.936
I wouldn't do them any way,
never mind now.

20:38.003 --> 20:39.137
Morning.
Hi, Vicky.

20:39.204 --> 20:42.307
You all right?
Yeah, how've you done?

20:42.374 --> 20:45.410
I know that Anna's here
about these fucking birds.

20:45.477 --> 20:48.046
The thing is,
we haven't even made half,

20:48.113 --> 20:49.948
so I've not got a leg to stand on.

20:50.015 --> 20:52.851
How many have we got in total?
We've got about 100.

20:52.918 --> 20:54.219
About 100?
Yeah.

20:54.286 --> 20:57.923
Anna's here and she wants to
count these stupid oregano pigeons

20:57.990 --> 21:00.626
and we are nowhere near finished.
Fuck.

21:00.692 --> 21:04.296
I don't think it's fair to blame
everyone. It's not a group effort.

21:04.363 --> 21:07.466
Marnie spent most of her time in bed,
couldn't be arsed.

21:07.532 --> 21:11.069
I didn't even want her to help,
she just made the energy go down.

21:11.136 --> 21:14.106
Oh, my God.
It's true, mate.

21:14.172 --> 21:16.541
Vicky's grassed us up.
Is she having a laugh?

21:16.608 --> 21:18.377
Who the fuck does she think she is?

21:18.443 --> 21:20.145
Vicky was shit at showing us...

21:20.212 --> 21:22.814
How dare you throw me under the bus,
you lazy cow!

21:22.881 --> 21:27.319
Vicky, it seems like you've been
let down by everybody here,

21:27.386 --> 21:29.655
but ultimately,
you are the team leader.

21:29.721 --> 21:33.091
I know, I know it's my fault.
I think you need to up your game.

21:33.158 --> 21:35.427
I'm sorry,
I won't let you down again.

21:35.494 --> 21:39.364
You want to thank your lucky stars
cos this event got cancelled.

21:41.533 --> 21:46.972
Seven hours. Seven hours I've spent
folding these fucking birds.

21:47.039 --> 21:50.942
I've got paper cuts, paper cuts
on top of fucking paper cuts.

21:51.009 --> 21:54.980
In waltzes Anna, all nonchalant,
and just announces quite casually

21:55.047 --> 21:57.749
that the event's been cancelled!
Cancelled?!

21:57.816 --> 22:02.220
I'll fold you into the shape of
a fucking paper bird, you daft slag!

22:02.287 --> 22:06.158
Anyway, you've got
a Tash On Tours job tonight.

22:06.224 --> 22:08.894
I want brilliant feedback
from this one.

22:08.960 --> 22:12.731
Don't let her down. Bye.
Bye, Anna.

22:12.798 --> 22:15.467
These fucking birds
have pissed us right off!

22:15.534 --> 22:18.070
Fucking...
(laughter)

22:19.771 --> 22:22.374
So, we've got work this evening.

22:22.441 --> 22:24.309
You're going.
Wicked.

22:24.376 --> 22:27.846
Scott, you're going.
Gaz, you're going. Wicked.

22:27.913 --> 22:30.782
Tonight I'm sending Aaron, Scott
and Gary to work.

22:30.849 --> 22:35.220
They did really well with the origami
and I know they love Tash On Tours.

22:35.287 --> 22:38.123
And... I'm gonna say Marnie.

22:38.190 --> 22:40.258
Marnie, she was a lazy cow,

22:40.325 --> 22:44.463
so she can fucking go
cos I know she hates work. Haha!

22:44.529 --> 22:47.632
The rest of yous,
enjoy your night off.

23:01.246 --> 23:03.849
I'm just gonna speak to him.
What you gonna say?

23:03.915 --> 23:07.819
I'm just gonna say, erm,
I'm gonna play it really cool.

23:07.886 --> 23:09.788
Playing it cool never works, Char.

23:09.855 --> 23:13.058
I don't know how to act or behave
around Gary.

23:13.125 --> 23:15.827
It's been such a long time
since we've been close,

23:15.894 --> 23:17.462
I don't know how to play it.

23:17.529 --> 23:21.366
I had this really big cool plan.
What was the cool plan?

23:21.433 --> 23:26.238
I was just gonna be like, I just
wanna pull you aside for a second...

23:26.304 --> 23:30.575
Just to let you know,
I'm just breezy with all this.

23:30.642 --> 23:33.078
You can't say that, though,
cos you're not.

23:33.145 --> 23:35.580
Yeah, I am.
No, you're not.

23:35.647 --> 23:37.582
I am breezy.
You're not breezy.

23:37.649 --> 23:41.019
Everybody knows Charlotte and breezy
don't go together.

23:41.086 --> 23:43.188
She doesn't know
how to play it cool.

23:43.255 --> 23:46.091
Why do I not feel fine with him
going out and pulling?

23:46.158 --> 23:48.927
I can't tell him I'm breezy
cos I'm not breezy.

23:48.994 --> 23:50.328
You're not breezy at all!

23:50.395 --> 23:53.198
I wanna tell Gary that
I don't want him to pull anyone.

23:53.265 --> 23:55.200
Cos I don't want him to pull anyone.

23:55.267 --> 23:56.535
This is too confusing.

23:56.601 --> 23:59.571
I had a boyfriend two days ago
for fuck's sake.

23:59.638 --> 24:01.373
What the hell is going on?

24:08.213 --> 24:10.582
Right then, yous all ready?
Come on then.

24:10.649 --> 24:12.517
Have a good night!
Bye!

24:17.856 --> 24:21.827
I will. What?
(laughs)

24:21.893 --> 24:22.894
(Vicky) See ya!

24:22.961 --> 24:26.131
I'm going.
(stutters)

24:26.198 --> 24:30.368
Charlotte shouts over, but all she's
doing is stuttering and laughing.

24:30.435 --> 24:32.571
I know for a fact
what she was gonna say.

24:32.637 --> 24:35.207
Charlotte, I'm going.
Right, OK.

24:35.273 --> 24:38.143
Right?
(stutters)

24:38.210 --> 24:40.045
(laughs)

24:40.111 --> 24:42.280
Why? Why is this happening?

24:42.347 --> 24:45.617
The words are there,
they're just not coming out.

24:45.684 --> 24:48.286
Don't pull anyone!

24:48.353 --> 24:50.088
I've gotta go.

24:51.089 --> 24:53.358
No.
All right, OK, that's good.

24:53.425 --> 24:55.427
(laughs)

24:55.493 --> 24:58.630
Oh, God, I'm so embarrassed!

25:01.800 --> 25:04.336
We're all off to Tash On Tours
at Tiger Tiger.

25:05.670 --> 25:07.305
Tonight is Singles Night.

25:07.372 --> 25:10.575
Let's play games and see
how many people we get necking on.

25:10.642 --> 25:12.444
This one's called lip synching.

25:12.510 --> 25:15.413
The winner is
who can cover their partner

25:15.480 --> 25:17.616
in as many kisses as possible.

25:17.682 --> 25:20.852
Marnie, are you gonna
do this one as well?

25:22.520 --> 25:26.091
I asked Marnie to do the lip synching
game with one of the singles,

25:26.157 --> 25:27.158
she refused.

25:27.225 --> 25:30.495
That's what it's all about,
getting the singles involved.

25:31.730 --> 25:33.899
I don't get why Vicky's
doing this to us.

25:33.965 --> 25:36.201
What the fuck is
this lass's problem?

25:36.268 --> 25:38.503
Scott, will you do this game
with Marnie?

25:38.570 --> 25:40.739
Bit of a blast from the past
but I'll do it.

25:40.805 --> 25:42.707
Soz, Aaron. Divn't get jealous.

25:42.774 --> 25:43.775
Now!

25:45.510 --> 25:48.780
I do not want to watch Scott
and Marnie all over each other.

25:48.847 --> 25:51.483
If I watch this game,
I'm gonna wind meself up.

25:51.549 --> 25:54.219
(Vicky counts)

25:54.286 --> 25:58.456
If looks could kill, Marnie and Scott
would be six feet under.

25:58.523 --> 26:00.725
Aaron is fucking foaming.

26:00.792 --> 26:05.597
Guys, we have a winner,
Marnie and Scott got 30,

26:05.664 --> 26:08.433
this lovely couple got 45!

26:11.870 --> 26:12.871
Hey!

26:14.205 --> 26:16.241
Don't talk to me.
Shut up, you muppet!

26:16.308 --> 26:17.642
Of course I'm pissed off.

26:17.709 --> 26:21.880
I know it's just a game but if I was
kissing a girl, she would go off it.

26:25.083 --> 26:27.118
I am so glad we are not
at work tonight,

26:27.185 --> 26:29.154
which means we can go out
and get on it.

26:42.968 --> 26:43.969
No.

26:48.373 --> 26:51.810
I am a jealous person and it
comes out even more with Marnie.

26:53.244 --> 26:55.847
OK. Listen, listen, listen. OK.

26:55.914 --> 26:59.184
I'm secretly quite pleased
I made Aaron jealous with Scott

26:59.250 --> 27:01.486
because at least now
I know he still cares.

27:01.553 --> 27:03.688
Ready, let's go!

27:06.925 --> 27:08.626
(cheering)

27:10.695 --> 27:13.732
Work is finally over and although
there was no tashing on,

27:13.798 --> 27:15.500
everyone pulled their weight,

27:15.567 --> 27:18.570
apart from Marnie
who is a bit of a bellend.

27:28.480 --> 27:31.216
We get to the club
and the squad are already there,

27:31.282 --> 27:35.487
but now that I'm in the building,
the party can really get started.

27:40.725 --> 27:42.527
Charlotte is looking fit.

27:42.594 --> 27:45.030
I might have
another bed guest tonight.

27:52.504 --> 27:54.506
Gary's telling us
he's not gonna pull

27:54.572 --> 27:58.009
and I can't help but feel completely
and utterly over the moon.

28:04.749 --> 28:07.419
Mine and Marnie's arguments
are ridiculous,

28:07.485 --> 28:10.555
because to be honest I really
like her and I can't keep away.

28:21.066 --> 28:23.935
Here I am again, playing cupid
with Aaron and Marnie.

28:24.002 --> 28:25.970
Come on, guys, kiss and make up.

28:35.346 --> 28:38.016
Now, me and Aaron
are all over each other again.

28:38.083 --> 28:41.419
We're flirting, we're even kissing.
I can't keep up.

28:41.486 --> 28:44.422
Aaron and Marnie
are all over each other again.

28:44.489 --> 28:48.126
It's funny how she can click her
fingers and he forgets everything

28:48.193 --> 28:49.794
and turns into a pure melt.

28:52.430 --> 28:54.265
Tonight is going amazing.

28:54.332 --> 28:56.801
Everyone is mortal,
everyone is getting on.

28:56.868 --> 28:59.437
This night couldn't be better.

29:05.743 --> 29:07.679
(retches)
Stop it!

29:07.745 --> 29:11.316
I'm absolutely mortal, I've been
sick in a cup, we're going home.

29:19.157 --> 29:22.961
Back at the house and Scotty T
drunk equals pure bedlam.

29:34.639 --> 29:36.741
I live in a house full of animals.

29:36.808 --> 29:38.910
I'm starting to feel like
a zookeeper.

29:42.113 --> 29:44.215
Me and Marnie are getting on
really well

29:44.282 --> 29:48.119
and to be honest, all the arguments
make us wanna come back for more.

29:51.823 --> 29:54.425
If anything is going to
happen tonight,

29:54.492 --> 29:58.129
I need to be prepared. No way I'm
letting him touch my hairy fanny.

29:58.196 --> 29:59.964
Marns...

30:03.835 --> 30:05.537
(they laugh)

30:05.603 --> 30:08.640
I've decided to give her a hand
shaving her vagina.

30:08.706 --> 30:11.442
I don't feel as bad
getting in bed with Aaron

30:11.509 --> 30:13.211
if you get in bed with Gary.

30:13.278 --> 30:17.482
No, do you know what?
I don't feel bad either about it.

30:18.683 --> 30:19.884
(laughs)

30:19.951 --> 30:25.223
Right, the only thing that matters
right now is your vagina.

30:25.290 --> 30:27.225
I can't concentrate on me fanny now.

30:27.292 --> 30:29.093
(laughs)

30:34.465 --> 30:38.736
You are my boy. My boy.

30:38.803 --> 30:41.806
I'm your boy now, am I?
My boy. Eventually.

30:41.873 --> 30:44.943
I can't wait to get into bed,
it's been weeks of teasing

30:45.009 --> 30:46.344
and I'm horny as fuck.

30:48.680 --> 30:52.317
Me and Aaron are having a kiss and
a cuddle and I'm so happy about it.

30:52.383 --> 30:55.887
After all the arguing,
I didn't expect this to happen.

31:03.628 --> 31:06.464
Looks like me and Gary
are gonna cuddle again tonight

31:06.531 --> 31:08.533
and maybe even a bit more.

31:09.434 --> 31:11.369
Oh, my God!

31:12.437 --> 31:15.440
I can't believe I'm back
in the shag pad with Charlotte.

31:15.506 --> 31:18.409
It is so weird
how quick times can change.

31:19.277 --> 31:20.612
(Charlotte moans)

31:21.446 --> 31:24.782
Why should I clean that shit up?
Because you're not a princess!

31:24.849 --> 31:26.684
Being team leader sucks cock.

31:26.751 --> 31:30.388
I've just automatically
started liking Gary again.

31:32.156 --> 31:35.827
I don't care about anyone else,
me and her are perfect together.

31:35.893 --> 31:38.229
(all) Geordie Shore, why-aye!

31:40.231 --> 31:40.431
.

31:42.967 --> 31:43.167
.

31:55.213 --> 31:59.284
(giggles) Morning, everyone.
Morning, everyone.

31:59.350 --> 32:01.653
Why have you got a naughty grin
on your face?

32:01.719 --> 32:06.324
Tell us you haven't shagged Gary?
I didn't shag him. You got poked?

32:06.391 --> 32:09.761
I'm feeling pretty naughty
and satisfied this morning.

32:09.827 --> 32:11.763
Everyone loves a cheeky digit.

32:11.829 --> 32:15.433
And I think I sucked him off.
(laughs)

32:17.068 --> 32:19.504
The look on Charlotte's face
says it all.

32:19.570 --> 32:22.106
She looks like the cat
that got chlamydia.

32:22.173 --> 32:24.976
I got poked, too.
(laughter)

32:25.843 --> 32:27.879
What the hell?

32:27.945 --> 32:30.848
Who doesn't love
synchronised fingering?

32:30.915 --> 32:33.484
I wonder if our moans
were even in tune.

32:33.551 --> 32:37.422
Get what we want then we fuck off.
Ooh, you big players(!)

32:37.488 --> 32:39.223
Ooh, yeah, go on, lasses!

32:39.290 --> 32:41.225
Charlotte got poked by Gaz,

32:41.292 --> 32:45.663
Marnie got poked off Aaron and I went
to bed with me wrinkle cream on.

32:45.730 --> 32:49.167
I know who I think's the winner
in this situation.

32:50.134 --> 32:52.804
(phone rings)

32:55.373 --> 32:58.876
The phone rings and I've got
a funny feeling it's going to be Anna

32:58.943 --> 33:03.448
and I just know she's going to want
to find out what happened at work.

33:03.514 --> 33:05.483
Hi, Anna. You all right?

33:05.550 --> 33:07.185
It was a brilliant night.

33:07.251 --> 33:10.254
The only exception was I asked
Marnie to demonstrate

33:10.321 --> 33:12.724
on one of the clients
and she wouldn't.

33:13.725 --> 33:16.227
I know.
I never thought I'd hear that.

33:16.294 --> 33:19.964
Anna's right. I'm allowing Marnie
to walk all over us.

33:20.031 --> 33:21.866
What the fuck is wrong with us?

33:24.369 --> 33:25.370
OK.

33:31.409 --> 33:32.744
Sounds interesting.

33:32.810 --> 33:35.246
Today's work is blind speed dating.

33:35.313 --> 33:38.349
I've no idea what it is,
but it sounds exciting.

33:38.416 --> 33:40.418
Work this afternoon, two of yous.

33:40.485 --> 33:44.288
Stop looking at me!
Well, you met me eye, didn't you?

33:44.355 --> 33:46.524
You're at work this afternoon.
Oh, man!

33:46.591 --> 33:49.160
What is the point being
friends with the boss,

33:49.227 --> 33:51.662
when she still sends you to work?

33:51.729 --> 33:55.600
And so are you, James. I'm coming
with yous, in a supervisory role.

33:55.666 --> 33:57.301
There's gonna be punishments

33:57.368 --> 34:00.104
if I don't think one of yous
performs well at work.

34:00.171 --> 34:02.407
Bearing that in mind,
last night, Marnie,

34:02.473 --> 34:06.010
I asked you to do the lip synching
game with a single, you refused.

34:06.077 --> 34:08.246
I didn't pull me weight last night?

34:08.312 --> 34:12.516
I put in so much effort.
What the fuck is wrong with her?

34:12.583 --> 34:15.786
Unfortunately today I'm gonna ask you
to clean the kitchen.

34:15.853 --> 34:18.856
(laughter)
I'm not doing the dishes.

34:18.922 --> 34:21.859
I'm not cleaning everyone's
shitty fucking plates up,

34:21.926 --> 34:24.328
especially not for fucking
boss bitch Vicky.

34:24.395 --> 34:26.630
Marnie. Your marigolds are calling.

34:31.202 --> 34:32.603
I'm off to work.

34:32.670 --> 34:36.239
I haven't been yet, so maybes it's
about time I pulled me finger out.

34:37.675 --> 34:39.744
The idea behind blind speed dating

34:39.811 --> 34:42.612
is that you get to know
the person you're chatting to.

34:42.679 --> 34:45.516
You don't judge them purely on
physical appearance.

34:45.583 --> 34:46.784
It's a good idea.

34:46.851 --> 34:50.087
One that some of the lads
in the house could certainly use.

34:50.154 --> 34:52.422
Speed date!

34:52.489 --> 34:55.293
Oh, look at yous two, saucy bastards.

34:55.359 --> 34:56.527
Cracking on already.

34:56.594 --> 34:58.362
Go on!

34:58.429 --> 34:59.897
I can't believe my eyes.

34:59.964 --> 35:03.734
I have never seen speed-dating
like it, it's unreal.

35:03.801 --> 35:08.039
(screams) You don't want to get too
excited in one of these suits.

35:08.105 --> 35:10.808
Everyone is loving it.
This is a success.

35:10.875 --> 35:13.878
One, two, three!

35:19.984 --> 35:21.586
Oi, oi.
Hi.

35:27.391 --> 35:30.328
I get back from work
and who would have thought it?

35:30.394 --> 35:34.465
The kitchen's still a pigsty.
Thanks a lot, Marnie, you lazy bint.

35:34.532 --> 35:35.533
Marnie!

35:37.168 --> 35:39.604
Fuck.
Marnie hasn't cleaned the kitchen.

35:39.670 --> 35:42.173
Vicky is going to kick the fuck off.

35:44.909 --> 35:48.946
Vicky's just stormed in the room
woke us out of a deep, nice sleep

35:49.013 --> 35:51.816
and kicked off
about not cleaning the kitchen.

35:51.883 --> 35:54.252
Who the fuck does she think she is?

35:54.318 --> 35:56.487
I don't know why I got punished,

35:56.554 --> 35:59.557
cos I feel like
I didn't do anything wrong.

35:59.624 --> 36:02.960
You're about to get worse cos
you're not going out tonight. OK.

36:03.027 --> 36:06.097
I pretend I don't care,
but I'm fucking burning inside.

36:06.163 --> 36:07.465
I fucking hate her!

36:07.532 --> 36:11.569
You don't seem very disappointed.
I think you see this as a big joke.

36:11.636 --> 36:14.839
So if you think it's so funny,
you can stay in tonight

36:14.906 --> 36:16.541
and clean the entire kitchen

36:16.607 --> 36:20.945
and if it's not done when I come
back, you will stay in every night.

36:21.012 --> 36:24.048
Well, do that then cos I feel like
this is not on at all.

36:24.115 --> 36:27.318
Vicky's saying I've got to stay in
until the kitchen's clean.

36:27.385 --> 36:28.419
Bothered?

36:28.486 --> 36:32.823
Why should I clean everyone's filth?
That's everyone's there.

36:32.890 --> 36:34.892
I've done nothing wrong.
You have.

36:34.959 --> 36:37.161
Everyone is doing what I tell them.

36:37.228 --> 36:39.864
I don't know who she thinks
she's kicking off at,

36:39.931 --> 36:43.701
if she's not fucking careful, I'll
hoy her in the dishwasher an' all.

36:43.768 --> 36:49.407
Tell me, why should I clean that up?
Why are you different to anyone else?

36:50.207 --> 36:52.510
Why should I clean
that shit hole up?

36:53.844 --> 36:55.880
Why should I?
Everyone has to do it!

36:55.947 --> 36:58.549
I'm telling you!
I would never ask you to do it.

36:58.616 --> 37:01.652
You're not the boss.
I wouldn't ask you to do it!

37:01.719 --> 37:03.454
Fuck off, Marnie, forget it.

37:03.521 --> 37:06.424
Vicky's taking this boss role
way too far

37:06.490 --> 37:09.260
and it's starting to come
in between us as friends.

37:09.327 --> 37:13.497
No-one fucking wants you to be boss,
you take it too fucking seriously!

37:13.564 --> 37:14.599
Oh, my God.

37:14.665 --> 37:17.335
Being team leader proper sucks cock.

37:17.401 --> 37:20.137
I thought I was gonna
sit round and do fuck all.

37:20.204 --> 37:22.607
But in reality,
it's getting on me tits.

37:22.673 --> 37:24.475
Fuck! That got serious.

37:26.544 --> 37:28.913
You can't get yourself
upset about it.

37:42.560 --> 37:46.864
We're all heading out, minus Marnie,
and I hope that without her there,

37:46.931 --> 37:49.667
we're headed for
an argument free night.

37:50.568 --> 37:53.170
Bye, Marnie!
Bye, Marns! Bye!

37:57.208 --> 37:58.776
All the others have gone out

37:58.843 --> 38:02.480
and I've got to stay in until
the kitchen's clean. Fuck my life.

38:02.546 --> 38:06.484
I've done a few dishes,
enough for us all to eat off

38:06.550 --> 38:09.887
and I've put the rest of them
in a bin liner and hid them.

38:11.756 --> 38:14.492
As far as Vicky will be able
to tell, I've cleaned.

38:14.558 --> 38:16.727
What she doesn't know
won't hurt her.

38:17.595 --> 38:19.430
Fuck this. I'm going out.

38:22.566 --> 38:26.871
I'm absolutely buzzing for tonight.
It's our favourite place, Bijoux.

38:36.280 --> 38:37.815
Me and Kyle are on the pull.

38:37.882 --> 38:42.253
Thank God someone in the house
shares the same joys as me. Fanny!

38:51.328 --> 38:56.100
Shit. Gary is talking to the girls.
What do I do? What do I do?

38:56.167 --> 38:59.103
Play it breezy.
I've gotta play this cool.

39:12.249 --> 39:14.685
I know what's going through
Charlotte's head.

39:14.752 --> 39:17.521
She sees me talking to girls,
thinks I'm gonna pull.

39:17.588 --> 39:20.891
I'm not gonna pull any time soon.
Get used to it.

39:24.729 --> 39:28.532
I can't help but feel paranoid
because of all the shit in the past.

39:36.841 --> 39:39.810
Gary saying he's not
gonna pull any other girls,

39:39.877 --> 39:42.413
but I still don't know
whether I fully trust him

39:42.480 --> 39:44.548
and I don't know
whether I ever will.

39:57.561 --> 40:00.965
Tonight is fucking mint, but it's
weird not having Marnie here.

40:02.600 --> 40:05.503
I'm walking into Bijoux
and I'm feeling so nervous

40:05.569 --> 40:09.974
cos I haven't cleaned the kitchen,
I have to bare-faced lie to Vicky.

40:11.408 --> 40:12.643
(screaming)

40:13.544 --> 40:17.348
Marnie's here. Thank God, that must
mean she's cleaned the kitchen

40:17.414 --> 40:19.650
and we can put all this mess to bed.

40:25.689 --> 40:29.393
I look at her straight in the eyes
and lie, it didn't even bother us.

40:30.828 --> 40:34.331
I'm buzzing. Nights without Marnie
aren't the same.

40:34.398 --> 40:36.600
She can always put a smile
on my face.

40:44.642 --> 40:46.744
I would hate to be Marnie

40:46.811 --> 40:49.346
when Vicky finds out
she hasn't done the dishes.

41:00.357 --> 41:04.395
Everyone's mortal. Time to go home.
It's been the best night ever.

41:14.505 --> 41:18.042
We get back to the house and Kyle is
licking my boob and I'm loving it,

41:18.108 --> 41:20.411
but this is the furthest
it's gonna go.

41:27.151 --> 41:28.252
Night.

41:28.319 --> 41:30.287
Yes, thank God. I did it.

41:30.354 --> 41:33.724
I'm a strong, independent woman
who's in her own bed.

41:39.463 --> 41:43.567
This is the third night, you know.
So?

41:46.103 --> 41:49.540
Fuck. Three times
means shit is getting real.

41:49.607 --> 41:52.843
How has this happened?
How has this happened?

41:52.910 --> 41:56.680
I'm enjoying spending time with you,
so I'm enjoying meself.

41:57.748 --> 42:00.150
I'm having fun as well, I just...

42:00.951 --> 42:04.221
It's came out of nowhere.
I know.

42:04.288 --> 42:07.892
Things are starting to sink in
that I've moved on so fast

42:07.958 --> 42:11.962
and back into something that
used to hurt us so much before

42:12.029 --> 42:15.266
and I've automatically
started liking Gary again.

42:15.332 --> 42:17.601
In the past we used to argue
all the time

42:17.668 --> 42:21.205
about me pulling birds
and blah, blah, blah...

42:21.272 --> 42:24.308
But when we had good times,
we had good times.

42:24.375 --> 42:26.543
So, if we cut the pulling birds out,

42:26.610 --> 42:31.815
it means we just have good times
all the time, then everyone's happy.

42:32.950 --> 42:38.255
Is that right? That true?
(sighs)

42:38.322 --> 42:42.359
Gary's saying if he doesn't pull,
we won't argue. Of course we won't.

42:42.426 --> 42:44.695
That's the only time
we used to argue.

42:44.762 --> 42:46.964
You used to upset us
cos you were pulling.

42:50.968 --> 42:52.903
No tongues.
Why no tongues?

42:52.970 --> 42:57.041
I'm not ready to move that fast.
We had tongues last night.

42:57.107 --> 42:59.677
That was when I was drunk.

42:59.743 --> 43:01.312
Get in.

43:03.447 --> 43:08.218
Me and Charlotte are getting on
amazing, I enjoy being around her.

43:08.285 --> 43:12.923
I don't care about anyone else,
cos me and her are perfect together.

43:19.363 --> 43:24.468
Man's got unfinished business.
Are you having a fucking laugh?

43:24.535 --> 43:26.904
Don't you fucking start with me!

43:26.971 --> 43:31.608
