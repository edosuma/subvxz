00:10.061 --> 00:11.193
ANDY BASSICH: I'M LOOKING FOR
A POLE BECAUSE I NEED TO MAKE

00:11.295 --> 00:15.364
AN ICE CHISEL FOR
CHOPPING ICE OUT ON FORD LAKE.

00:15.466 --> 00:19.435
I'M GONNA GO MUSKRAT TRAPPING,
SO I'VE GOT A LOT OF HOLES AND

00:19.537 --> 00:21.303
A LOT OF ICE TO CHOP.

00:21.972 --> 00:24.339
AND I'VE DECIDED I WANNA
MAKE A NICE NEW, GOOD,

00:24.442 --> 00:26.975
EFFICIENT ICE CHISEL.

00:27.078 --> 00:28.477
I'M GOING BACK TO THE
OLD FASHIONED WOOD,

00:29.547 --> 00:31.647
TRIED AND TRUE.

00:31.749 --> 00:34.316
MY NAME IS ANDY BASSICH.

00:35.119 --> 00:37.319
I LIVE HERE AT CALICO BLUFF
ALONG THE YUKON RIVER FOR

00:37.421 --> 00:40.789
ABOUT 30 YEARS.

00:40.891 --> 00:44.226
SOMETHING INSIDE OF ME TOLD
ME I NEEDED TO GO TO ALASKA.

00:44.328 --> 00:46.495
AND FORTUNATELY, I LISTENED
TO IT AND I TOOK ACTION.

00:47.965 --> 00:50.365
THAT'S THE BEST
THING I EVER DID.

00:51.235 --> 00:53.902
FOR SOME PEOPLE, LIVING
THE LIFESTYLE I HAVE WOULD

00:54.004 --> 00:55.838
BE SHEER HELL.

00:56.073 --> 00:58.874
AND FOR ME,
IT'S SHEER PARADISE.

01:01.045 --> 01:03.212
WHAT I FIND REALLY ENTHRALLING
ABOUT THIS LIFESTYLE IS

01:03.314 --> 01:06.949
EVERY SINGLE THING THAT
I HAVE AND I NEED OUT HERE,

01:07.051 --> 01:09.518
I HAVE TO GO GET.

01:10.121 --> 01:12.154
THERE'S NOTHING THAT MAKES
ME FEEL BETTER THAN GETTING A

01:12.256 --> 01:15.924
1,200-POUND MOOSE ON THE
GROUND AND SEEING HIM IN MY

01:16.026 --> 01:18.627
FREEZER OR ON MY
BARBECUE GRILL.

01:20.898 --> 01:22.698
I THINK IT'S A RARE THING
IN THIS WORLD WHEN PEOPLE

01:22.800 --> 01:25.968
CAN FIND A PLACE THAT
THEY'RE SUPPOSED TO BE IN,

01:26.537 --> 01:29.872
BE COMFORTABLE THERE,
AND BE SATISFIED THERE.

01:30.741 --> 01:33.776
THAT PUTS ME IN THE TOP 1%
OF THE WORLD'S POPULATION.

01:36.514 --> 01:43.652
<i>¶ [THEME MUSIC PLAYS] ¶</i>

01:58.369 --> 02:01.537
¶ ¶

02:01.639 --> 02:03.372
ONE OF THE NICE THINGS
ABOUT WHERE I LIVE RIGHT HERE

02:03.474 --> 02:05.374
IS I HAVE THE YUKON
ON ONE SIDE OF ME,

02:05.476 --> 02:09.545
BUT I'VE ALSO GOT A
REALLY NICE BIG LAKE.

02:09.647 --> 02:12.347
I HAVE A REALLY
GOOD POPULATION OF

02:12.449 --> 02:15.083
MUSKRATS OUT THERE.

02:15.186 --> 02:18.687
AND MY HOPE IS THAT
I'M GONNA BE ABLE TO PUT A

02:18.789 --> 02:20.789
TRAP THERE AND CAPTURE THEM.

02:20.891 --> 02:24.059
I CAN TURN THOSE INTO
MITTENS, OR A HAT,

02:24.161 --> 02:26.195
OR WHATEVER I WANT FOR FUR.

02:26.297 --> 02:28.063
AND ALSO, I REALLY
LIKE THE FOOD.

02:29.533 --> 02:31.700
THAT'S FEELING PRETTY GOOD.

02:37.041 --> 02:40.475
I KIND OF HAD A MAJOR
ACCIDENT THIS YEAR AND CUT OFF

02:40.578 --> 02:42.811
THE END OF MY PINKY FINGER.

02:42.913 --> 02:45.347
WORKING WITH MY SAWMILL,
TURNING A HEAVY LOG,

02:45.449 --> 02:48.917
I PINCHED A FINGER REALLY BAD.

02:49.854 --> 02:53.288
I BASICALLY SEVERED
THE TIP OF THE FINGER OFF.

02:54.291 --> 02:57.326
IT WAS A REAL AWAKENING TO
HOW QUICK THINGS CAN HAPPEN AND

02:57.428 --> 02:59.761
WHAT AN IMPACT THEY HAVE.

02:59.864 --> 03:03.098
ONE MOMENT OF AN ACCIDENT
IMPACTS ME FOR THE REST

03:03.200 --> 03:04.266
OF THE WINTER NOW.

03:04.368 --> 03:06.101
WHEN I CUT MY FINGER OFF,
I TRIED TO GET TO FAIRBANKS.

03:06.203 --> 03:09.104
I HAD A BUDDY OF MINE
FLY ME UP TO EAGLE,

03:09.206 --> 03:11.406
COULDN'T GET INTO FAIRBANKS
BECAUSE OF WEATHER,

03:11.508 --> 03:14.343
SO I DECIDED TO COME BACK
DOWN TO CALICO BLUFF AND

03:14.445 --> 03:16.979
DEAL WITH IT MYSELF.

03:19.917 --> 03:23.051
I'M BEGINNING TO REALIZE HOW
IMPORTANT THE PINKY FINGER IS

03:23.153 --> 03:26.388
TO THE TYPES OF THINGS I DO,
WHICH IS HOLDING HAMMERS,

03:26.490 --> 03:29.424
AND A LOT OF
BUILDING PROJECTS.

03:29.526 --> 03:31.493
THIS WAS A PRETTY
GOOD EVENING PROJECT.

03:31.595 --> 03:33.962
I GOT A GOOD HEAVY
DUTY, HOPEFULLY,

03:34.064 --> 03:36.398
ICE CHISEL THAT'S GONNA
CUT THAT ICE PRETTY GOOD.

03:36.500 --> 03:39.735
AND I'M READY TO GO
MUSKRAT TRAPPING TOMORROW.

03:43.574 --> 03:44.773
JESSIE HOLMES: THESE
DOGS HAVE GIVEN ME A LOT.

03:44.875 --> 03:48.110
THEY'VE GIVEN ME A LIFE
THAT I HAVE DIRECTION IN,

03:48.946 --> 03:50.612
SOMETHING THAT
I FEEL PASSIONATE ABOUT

03:50.714 --> 03:52.981
DOING EVERY DAY.

03:57.888 --> 04:00.489
RIGHT NOW, I'M GETTING READY
TO HEAD DOWN TO CANTWELL FOR

04:00.591 --> 04:01.323
THE FIRST RACE OF THE SEASON.

04:01.425 --> 04:04.493
THIS RACE IS A 65-MILE RACE.

04:04.595 --> 04:06.028
IT'S A VERY MOUNTAINOUS RACE.

04:06.130 --> 04:07.963
YOU HAVE TO HAVE YOUR
DOGS IN PRETTY GOOD SHAPE

04:08.065 --> 04:10.165
TO BE ABLE TO
RACE 65 MILES HARD.

04:10.267 --> 04:13.936
THE DOGS HAVE BEEN TRAINING
UP TO 300 MILES A WEEK.

04:14.038 --> 04:16.538
IT LOOKS LIKE IT'S
GONNA BE 30 BELOW ZERO,

04:16.640 --> 04:18.307
GONNA BE SOME FRESH
SNOW ON THE TRAIL.

04:18.409 --> 04:21.143
VERY, VERY STEEP CLIMBS,
VERY STEEP DESCENTS.

04:21.645 --> 04:23.612
THEY NEED LOTS OF
FAT AND PROTEIN.

04:23.714 --> 04:25.647
PROTEIN HELPS
THEM RECOVER, FAT,

04:25.749 --> 04:28.750
THEY USE TO BURN
ENERGY AND KEEP WARM.

04:29.453 --> 04:31.420
HEY, BOYS.

04:31.522 --> 04:33.188
THIS IS HOW EVERY
MORNING STARTS.

04:33.290 --> 04:34.122
I START EARLY.

04:34.224 --> 04:37.192
I GET THEM NICE AND HYDRATED.

04:37.294 --> 04:39.594
THEY GOT TO HAVE CONSISTENCY.

04:39.964 --> 04:42.097
THEIR BODIES HAVE TO BE
ADAPTED TO EXACTLY WHAT I'M

04:42.199 --> 04:44.967
GONNA DO WHEN I'M RACING.

04:52.509 --> 04:53.675
THIS IS GONNA BE
MY RACING SLED.

04:53.777 --> 04:56.111
I HAVEN'T EVEN USED
IT YET THIS YEAR.

04:56.213 --> 04:58.347
BRAKE BAR ON MY SLED IS BROKE.

04:58.449 --> 05:00.349
I'M GONNA TRY TO TAKE IT OFF
AND SEE IF I CAN BEND IT IN.

05:01.418 --> 05:03.952
<i>NARRATOR: FOR JESSIE HOLMES,</i>
<i>SLED DOG RACING IS A YEAR</i>

05:04.054 --> 05:06.955
<i>ROUND JOB, REQUIRING BOTH</i>
<i>RIGOROUS TRAINING FOR HIS</i>

05:07.057 --> 05:09.825
<i>TEAM, AND CONSTANT</i>
<i>MAINTENANCE OF HIS EQUIPMENT.</i>

05:15.766 --> 05:18.700
<i>WITH ONLY TWO DAYS BEFORE</i>
<i>HIS FIRST RACE OF THE SEASON,</i>

05:18.802 --> 05:20.969
<i>IT'S IMPERATIVE THAT</i>
<i>JESSIE MAKES HIS REPAIRS</i>

05:21.071 --> 05:24.139
<i>NOW TO AVOID FALLING</i>
<i>BEHIND THE COMPETITION.</i>

05:25.042 --> 05:27.042
JESSIE HOLMES: A LOT
OF PEOPLE GOT A LOT OF FANCY

05:27.144 --> 05:28.276
EQUIPMENT IN THIS SPORT.

05:28.379 --> 05:29.378
AND A LOT OF THEM
ARE HOURS, AND HOURS,

05:29.480 --> 05:32.047
AND EVEN DAYS BEHIND ME.

05:32.149 --> 05:34.416
I PUT MY WORK INTO THE DOGS.

05:34.518 --> 05:36.651
I GOT THIS BRAKE FIXED.

05:36.754 --> 05:38.587
IT SEEMS LIKE IT'S
GONNA DO GOOD.

05:40.924 --> 05:42.691
NOW, I'M GONNA COME OUT AND
CHECK OUT THE DOGS I'M GONNA

05:42.793 --> 05:45.761
TAKE TO THE RACE AND PUT
SOME OIL ON THEIR FEET,

05:46.096 --> 05:47.329
AND TRIM THEIR TOENAILS.

05:47.431 --> 05:49.631
I SAY ONE THING,
NO FOOT, NO DOG.

05:49.733 --> 05:52.300
IF YOU GOT A DOG WITH A BUM
FOOT, AND HIS FOOT'S HURTING,

05:52.403 --> 05:54.970
THAT GOES TO ITS MIND, AND THE
LAST THING I WANT MY DOG TO

05:55.072 --> 05:58.507
THINK IS THAT RACING'S NOT
THE FUNNEST THING EVER.

05:59.043 --> 06:01.410
NOW THAT I'VE INSPECTED ALL
THE DOGS' FEET AND GOT MY SLED

06:01.512 --> 06:04.379
READY, I GOTTA GET MY OWN
PERSONAL GEAR ALL READY,

06:04.615 --> 06:06.348
AND THEN I GOT A
LONG DAY TOMORROW.

06:06.450 --> 06:08.083
SO, THIS IS WHAT WE LIVE FOR,

06:08.185 --> 06:11.787
AND SO IT'S EXCITING THAT I
ONLY GOT ONE MORE DAY TO WAIT.

06:13.190 --> 06:14.823
HI, BOYS.

06:17.561 --> 06:19.361
GLENN VILLENEUVE:
IT'S ABOUT BEING CONFIDENT.

06:19.463 --> 06:21.029
IT'S ABOUT KNOWING
WHAT YOU'RE DOING,

06:21.131 --> 06:23.298
LEARNING WHAT YOU GOT TO
LEARN TO TAKE CARE OF YOURSELF,

06:23.400 --> 06:25.534
AND YOU DON'T HAVE TO WORRY.

06:33.444 --> 06:37.312
TODAY, I'M HEADED TO
A LAKE SIX OR SEVEN MILES

06:37.414 --> 06:38.713
FROM MY CAMP.

06:38.816 --> 06:40.816
WE'RE GETTING INTO THE
DEEPEST PART OF THE WINTER.

06:40.918 --> 06:43.318
THE COLDEST,
DARKEST TIME OF THE YEAR.

06:43.420 --> 06:45.287
VERY LITTLE SUNLIGHT.

06:45.389 --> 06:46.588
JUST TWILIGHT IN THE
MIDDLE OF THE DAY.

06:46.690 --> 06:49.257
I CAN SEE A LITTLE BIT OF
SUNSHINE IN THE MIDDLE OF

06:49.359 --> 06:52.727
THE DAY, AND THEN
IT DISAPPEARS.

06:53.831 --> 06:56.565
IT'S DARK MOST OF THE TIME,
BUT IT'S A GOOD TIME OF THE

06:56.667 --> 06:58.233
YEAR TO GO TRAPPING.

06:58.335 --> 07:00.168
THIS IS WHEN FUR
IS AT ITS PRIME.

07:00.270 --> 07:02.804
THIS IS WHEN I GO OUT AND
TRY TO CATCH SOME FUR.

07:03.407 --> 07:04.339
THE ICE IS THICK ENOUGH NOW.

07:04.441 --> 07:07.375
I CAN WALK SAFELY
ACROSS THE LAKES.

07:07.478 --> 07:09.578
I COULD TRAVEL THE
COUNTRY RELATIVELY EASILY.

07:09.680 --> 07:12.981
THIS IS THE TIME TO GET
TRAPS AND SNARES SET.

07:13.083 --> 07:15.283
SO, TODAY, I'M GONNA
GO OUT AND I'M GONNA SET

07:15.385 --> 07:17.652
SOME SNARES FOR BEAVER.

07:18.689 --> 07:22.224
LAST SPRING, I WAS EXPLORING
AND I FOUND A LAKE WHERE THERE

07:22.326 --> 07:23.758
WERE SOME BEAVERS LIVING.

07:23.861 --> 07:26.328
THAT WAS REALLY EXCITING TO
ME BECAUSE THERE ARE VERY FEW

07:26.430 --> 07:27.863
BEAVER IN THIS COUNTRY.

07:27.965 --> 07:29.631
BEAVER ARE A VALUABLE
ANIMAL BECAUSE THEY HAVE

07:29.733 --> 07:31.066
A VERY USEFUL FUR.

07:31.168 --> 07:33.068
IT'S A GOOD UTILITARIAN FUR.

07:33.170 --> 07:34.336
YOU CAN USE IT TO KEEP WARM.

07:34.438 --> 07:35.637
I WEAR BEAVER EVERY DAY.

07:35.739 --> 07:37.973
I'VE GOT BEAVER FUR RIGHT
UP NEXT TO MY FACE, NICE,

07:38.075 --> 07:38.874
AND SOFT, AND WARM.

07:38.976 --> 07:41.143
AND BEAVER'S REALLY
GOOD FOOD TO EAT.

07:41.245 --> 07:43.245
THEY'VE GOT A REALLY TASTY
MEAT AND THEY OFTEN HAVE

07:43.347 --> 07:45.614
A LOT OF FAT ON THEM.

07:45.716 --> 07:47.249
THE SOONER I GET
MY SNARES OUT,

07:47.351 --> 07:49.084
THE LONGER THEY'RE
GONNA WORK FOR ME.

07:49.186 --> 07:50.585
NOW IS THE TIME TO DO IT.

07:53.056 --> 07:55.323
WHAT I'M LOOKING FOR NOW
IS A REALLY GOOD BAIT TO

07:55.425 --> 07:57.459
CATCH A BEAVER WITH.

07:57.561 --> 07:59.594
RIGHT UP HERE, THERE'S
ONE LITTLE STAND OF ASPEN.

07:59.696 --> 08:02.297
THIS IS THE ONLY ASPEN AROUND
HERE FOR MILES AND MILES.

08:02.399 --> 08:04.299
IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT TO KNOW
THE COUNTRY OUT HERE WELL,

08:04.401 --> 08:07.435
BECAUSE THERE ARE ONLY
CERTAIN PLACES WHERE YOU

08:07.538 --> 08:08.603
CAN FIND CERTAIN RESOURCES.

08:08.705 --> 08:11.339
THIS ASPEN IS AN
EXCELLENT BAIT FOR BEAVER.

08:12.042 --> 08:14.242
AND AROUND THIS COUNTRY,
ASPEN'S HARD TO FIND.

08:14.578 --> 08:16.344
THE BEAVER DON'T GET A
CHANCE TO EAT IT NORMALLY.

08:16.446 --> 08:18.180
WHEN THEY SMELL THIS ASPEN,

08:18.282 --> 08:19.681
IT'S GONNA BE
SOMETHING DIFFERENT.

08:19.783 --> 08:21.082
IT'S GONNA BE A DELICACY.

08:21.185 --> 08:23.852
AND THERE'S A GOOD CHANCE
THE BEAVER WILL GO TO IT.

08:26.190 --> 08:28.290
TO A BEAVER, THAT'S
GONNA BE IRRESISTIBLE.

08:29.259 --> 08:31.259
NOW I JUST GOT TO GO TO
WHERE THE BEAVERS ARE,

08:31.361 --> 08:33.828
AND THAT'S SEVERAL
MORE MILES FROM HERE.

08:33.931 --> 08:35.263
OUT HERE, BEAVERS
ARE NOT PLENTIFUL.

08:35.365 --> 08:38.533
IF YOU WANNA CATCH ONE, YOU
HAVE TO WALK A LONG WAYS.

08:41.071 --> 08:43.071
SUE AIKENS: OPPORTUNITY
PRESENTS ITSELF OUT HERE AT

08:43.173 --> 08:45.240
A MOMENT'S NOTICE, AND IF
YOU CAN'T CHANGE YOUR GEARS

08:45.342 --> 08:47.609
ON THE FLY,
YOU'RE GONNA MISS OUT.

08:56.920 --> 09:03.124
¶ ¶

09:04.428 --> 09:07.462
I AM INTERESTED TO
SEE WHAT'S OVER HERE.

09:10.133 --> 09:11.132
SHEEP.

09:11.235 --> 09:12.334
THERE IS JUST A BUNCH.

09:12.436 --> 09:14.536
THERE'S A WAD OF 'EM,
A WHOLE BIG LINE.

09:14.638 --> 09:16.972
YOU CAN SEE THE
TRAILS GOING ACROSS.

09:17.074 --> 09:19.407
ALL THOSE TRACKS ARE
WHERE THOSE SHEEP HAVE

09:19.509 --> 09:21.142
GONE FOR CENTURIES.

09:21.245 --> 09:22.644
I SEE 26 PLUS.

09:22.746 --> 09:27.148
SOME OF 'EM ARE GOING BACK OVER
THE RIDGE TO THE OTHER SIDE.

09:27.251 --> 09:30.285
<i>NARRATOR: SUE AIKENS HAS</i>
<i>TRAVELED 70 MILES FROM HER</i>

09:44.167 --> 09:46.401
SUE AIKENS: TO HUNT SHEEP,
THEY DON'T LIVE IN THE BOTTOM

09:46.503 --> 09:48.570
OF THE LAND, THEY
LIVE UP IN THE TOP.

09:48.672 --> 09:50.472
THAT'S A GOOD SIX,
SEVEN HOUR HIKE.

09:50.574 --> 09:51.339
THIS IS NOT EASY HIKING.

09:51.441 --> 09:53.675
IT IS FROZEN.

09:53.777 --> 09:55.110
AS LONG AS I DON'T
GET A HEAVY SNOW,

09:55.212 --> 09:57.746
THERE'S NO REASON FOR THEM
TO WANNA COME DOWN LOWER YET.

09:57.848 --> 09:59.914
I'VE GOT TO COME UP TO THEM,

10:00.017 --> 10:02.317
AND THEN
YOU'RE SHOOTING UPHILL.

10:02.419 --> 10:04.786
SO, YOU'VE GOT
GRAVITY, WIND PROBABLY.

10:04.888 --> 10:06.288
I CAN SEE THERE'S WIND
UP HIGH BY WHAT'S HAPPENING

10:06.390 --> 10:09.658
WITH THE FOG AND
THE CLOUDS OVER THERE.

10:09.760 --> 10:11.059
THERE'S A LOT
OF ROOM FOR ERROR.

10:11.161 --> 10:13.628
THIS IS NOT A TYPICAL TIME
OF THE YEAR WHERE PEOPLE GO

10:13.730 --> 10:15.597
FLYING AROUND IN THE REFUGE.

10:15.699 --> 10:17.065
I'M GONNA GO CHECK IT OUT.

10:17.167 --> 10:19.601
I GOT THE PERMITS TO
DO A WINTER SHEEP HUNT.

10:19.703 --> 10:21.102
THE 50-SOMETHING YEARS THAT
I'VE BEEN ON THE PLANET,

10:21.204 --> 10:25.273
I'VE NEVER BEEN RECOGNIZED FOR
THE SUBSISTENCE HUNTING AND

10:25.375 --> 10:27.042
NOW THEY'VE ALLOWED IT.

10:27.144 --> 10:29.044
A LITTLE BIT OUT OF
SHAPE FOR A SHEEP HUNT,

10:29.146 --> 10:30.478
THAT'S NOT GONNA STOP ME.

10:30.580 --> 10:34.249
SHEEP HUNTING HAS ALWAYS
BEEN AND WILL ALWAYS BE ONE

10:34.351 --> 10:35.617
OF THE HARDEST.

10:35.719 --> 10:40.922
YOU ARE PITTED AGAINST AN
ENORMOUSLY INTELLIGENT CREATURE.

10:41.024 --> 10:41.956
THEY ARE HEARTY.

10:42.092 --> 10:44.926
THEY LIVE IN THE MOST
INHOSPITABLE REGIONS.

10:45.028 --> 10:47.962
YOU HAVE GOT TO HIDE YOURSELF
SIX WAYS FROM SUNDAY TO EVEN

10:48.065 --> 10:49.064
SNEAK UP ON THEM.

10:49.166 --> 10:51.800
YOU ARE PITTING YOURSELF
AGAINST THE APEX.

10:51.902 --> 10:55.770
THE ARCTIC, WHILE IT'S
GOT THIS PRISTINE BEAUTY,

10:56.940 --> 10:59.007
AND IT'S AUSTERE,
AND I MEAN,

10:59.109 --> 11:01.876
IT'S JUST INCOMPARABLE
IN A LOT OF WAYS.

11:01.978 --> 11:05.146
IT IS NOT DESIGNED TO
HAVE THE LESSER SPECIES

11:05.248 --> 11:06.414
THRIVE AND SURVIVE.

11:06.516 --> 11:08.583
IT IS MADE FOR THE TOUGH.

11:10.087 --> 11:12.354
OH, I JUST GOT MYSELF
SURROUNDED BY WATER.

11:12.456 --> 11:13.855
SUZY CANNOT CROSS THAT.

11:13.957 --> 11:16.491
JUST CRAZY TO HAVE THIS
MUCH WATER THIS TIME OF YEAR,

11:16.593 --> 11:17.692
IT REALLY IS.

11:17.794 --> 11:19.361
I'M AT ZERO DEGREES RIGHT NOW.

11:19.463 --> 11:23.765
IF I GET WET OR I HIT
MY HEAD, I'M DEAD.

11:24.301 --> 11:27.335
I CANNOT GET AN AIRPLANE
HERE TO RESCUE ME FOR

11:27.437 --> 11:29.371
ABOUT 24 HOURS.

11:29.473 --> 11:33.141
I CANNOT DO THAT TO
MYSELF JUST FOR A SHEEP.

11:34.511 --> 11:36.611
I'M NOT GONNA RISK IT.

11:36.713 --> 11:38.346
THE SHEEP ARE
PROBABLY UP THERE GOING...

11:38.448 --> 11:39.981
<i>[LAUGHS]</i>

11:40.884 --> 11:43.485
THAT SUN IS THE THING THAT'S
TELLING ME IT'S TIME FOR ME TO

11:43.587 --> 11:47.655
HEAD BACK, MAKE ANOTHER
PLAN FOR TOMORROW.

11:51.895 --> 11:53.361
ANDY BASSICH: WHEN YOU
LIVE OUT IN THE BUSH,

11:53.463 --> 11:54.863
YOU LEARN TO JUST
TRUST YOUR GUT.

11:54.965 --> 11:56.364
YOU LEARN THROUGH EXPERIENCES
JUST TO DO A LOT OF DIFFERENT

11:56.466 --> 12:00.168
THINGS AND THAT GIVES
YOU A CONFIDENCE.

12:04.841 --> 12:06.107
MY FINGER'S HEALING UP
REALLY WELL AND EVERYTHING'S

12:06.209 --> 12:09.944
GOING GOOD EXCEPT FOR WHEN
I PUT IT BACK TOGETHER,

12:10.046 --> 12:14.082
THE QUICK OR THE ROOT OF
THE NAIL DIED BECAUSE THERE

12:14.184 --> 12:15.450
WAS NO FLESH COVERING IT.

12:15.552 --> 12:17.118
THAT'S WHERE THE
INITIAL BREAK WAS.

12:17.220 --> 12:20.255
AND IT'S SLOWLY GETTING
TO THE POINT WHERE THERE'S

12:20.357 --> 12:21.890
NOT MUCH LEFT ATTACHED.

12:21.992 --> 12:24.025
JUST A LITTLE BIT
BACK DOWN IN HERE.

12:24.127 --> 12:26.528
AND WHAT I'M AFRAID OF IS,
I'M GONNA PULL A GLOVE OFF AND

12:26.630 --> 12:28.997
I'M GONNA SNAG THIS NAIL,
AND I'M GONNA RIP IT OFF

12:29.099 --> 12:31.032
IN AN UNCONTROLLED MANNER.

12:31.134 --> 12:33.902
SO, WHAT I REALLY NEED TO
DO IS I NEED TO SOAK THIS

12:34.004 --> 12:36.137
FOR A LITTLE BIT, GET
EVERYTHING NICE AND SOFT,

12:36.239 --> 12:39.073
AND THEN I NEED TO JUST
PEEL THAT NAIL OFF AND

12:39.176 --> 12:40.141
GET RID OF THIS NAIL.

12:40.243 --> 12:42.877
IT'S GONNA HURT, BUT IT'S
SOMETHING I GOT TO DO.

12:43.980 --> 12:46.481
ANY DIRT, ANY BACTERIA
YOU GET DOWN IN THERE,

12:46.583 --> 12:48.283
THAT COULD GET INFECTED,
AND THEN I COULD BE IN REAL

12:48.385 --> 12:51.553
TROUBLE IF I GET AN INFECTION.

12:51.655 --> 12:54.322
HOPEFULLY, IT'LL
COME OFF NICELY.

12:54.424 --> 12:56.357
I CAN TELL RIGHT NOW
THAT'S GONNA HURT.

12:56.460 --> 12:59.561
<i>[SIGHS]</i>

13:01.364 --> 13:03.047
BREATHE DEEP.

13:04.634 --> 13:07.435
ANDY BASSICH: BREATHE DEEP.

13:07.837 --> 13:10.571
OKAY, I'M JUST GONNA
DO A QUICK ONE.

13:12.642 --> 13:13.474
ON THREE.

13:13.576 --> 13:15.576
ONE, TWO, THREE.

13:17.580 --> 13:19.614
YOWZA.

13:19.916 --> 13:22.350
OH YEAH, WELL, THAT DID IT.

13:22.452 --> 13:24.085
IT'S OFF.

13:24.187 --> 13:25.353
HMM, OKAY, HOW ABOUT
A LITTLE ALCOHOL?

13:25.455 --> 13:27.588
THAT OUGHT TO GIVE IT A WINCE.

13:29.659 --> 13:32.527
WHEW, I THINK I'M
GONNA BE OKAY.

13:33.530 --> 13:37.398
A BIT OF A STING,
BUT SMALL PRICE TO PAY FOR

13:37.500 --> 13:40.668
STILL HAVING A FINGER.

13:46.276 --> 13:50.278
TIME TO GET KIND OF SETUP
FOR MUSKRAT TRAPPING.

13:53.016 --> 13:54.916
IT'S GONNA BE KIND OF AN
INTERESTING TIME OUT ON THE

13:55.018 --> 13:57.552
LAKE TODAY, TRYING
TO DEAL WITH THIS.

13:57.654 --> 13:59.320
IT'S PRETTY SENSITIVE
TO THE TOUCH,

13:59.422 --> 14:01.022
BUT I'M FEELING REALLY GOOD.

14:01.124 --> 14:03.491
I'M STARTING TO GET COLOR
AND A LITTLE BIT OF FEELING

14:03.593 --> 14:07.028
BACK TO THE
END OF THAT FINGER.

14:07.764 --> 14:09.297
IT REALLY COMPLICATES
EVERYTHING.

14:09.399 --> 14:11.299
IT SLOWS YOU DOWN,
NOT TO MENTION IT'S

14:11.401 --> 14:12.733
PRETTY UNCOMFORTABLE.

14:12.836 --> 14:13.968
BUT IT'S JUST SOMETHING YOU
GOT TO DEAL WITH, YOU KNOW,

14:14.070 --> 14:15.970
IF YOU'RE OUT IN THE
BUSH, YOU'RE ON YOUR OWN,

14:16.072 --> 14:18.005
YOU DEAL WITH IT.

14:18.107 --> 14:20.241
OH YEAH, THAT'LL WORK.

14:20.677 --> 14:22.877
OKAY, LET'S GO, GUYS.

14:23.079 --> 14:25.713
I THINK I'M READY TO
GO MUSKRAT TRAPPING.

14:27.951 --> 14:30.418
WHOA, GOOD BOYS.

14:30.520 --> 14:31.452
THAT WAS GOOD, BERGY.

14:31.554 --> 14:34.989
OOH, LOOK AT HOW
THICK THAT ICE IS.

14:35.992 --> 14:36.991
HOLY CRAP.

14:37.093 --> 14:39.193
IT LOOKS LIKE THERE'S
A GOOD 10 INCHES OF ICE ON

14:39.295 --> 14:40.328
THE LAKE RIGHT NOW.

14:40.430 --> 14:41.796
THAT'S NOT A GOOD SIGN.

14:41.898 --> 14:44.265
THE TEMPERATURE'S JUST
STARTED GETTING REALLY COLD,

14:44.367 --> 14:45.766
AND THE LAKE ICE
IS GETTING THICK.

14:45.869 --> 14:49.770
AND ONCE THOSE MUSKRATS CAN
NO LONGER KEEP THEIR HOLE OPEN,

14:49.873 --> 14:51.672
THEN TRAPPING FOR
MUSKRATS IS OVER.

14:53.109 --> 14:54.408
I'M GONNA FIND OUT IN A
MINUTE OR TWO WHETHER OR NOT

14:54.510 --> 14:58.179
THIS IS EVEN DOABLE
THIS LATE IN THE SEASON,

14:58.281 --> 15:01.415
BUT WE'LL KEEP OUR THUMBS UP.

15:01.784 --> 15:03.818
THERE'S QUITE A FEW MUSKRAT
HOUSES RIGHT IN THIS LITTLE

15:03.920 --> 15:06.754
SECTION, MIGHT
BE A TOTAL BUST.

15:06.856 --> 15:10.057
YOU NEVER KNOW UNTIL YOU TRY.

15:17.567 --> 15:21.102
I'M GONNA TRY AND
PUT A SET IN HERE.

15:27.944 --> 15:30.978
I'M GONNA GO GRAB SOME
CATTAILS, TOO, I THINK.

15:31.080 --> 15:32.380
IF I THROW THOSE ON
THERE, THAT WILL HELP.

15:32.482 --> 15:34.982
IT'S BEEN A STRANGE YEAR.

15:35.084 --> 15:36.851
VERY LITTLE SNOW.

15:36.953 --> 15:39.220
VERY WARM TEMPERATURES
FOR THE MOST PART.

15:39.322 --> 15:42.423
IT'S REALLY KIND OF SCREWED
UP THE WHOLE EFFORT TO GO

15:42.525 --> 15:44.959
TRAPPING BECAUSE THERE'S
NO SNOW TO INSULATE

15:45.061 --> 15:47.862
THE ICE VERY WELL.

15:48.431 --> 15:51.532
ALL RIGHT, I THINK I FEEL
PRETTY GOOD ABOUT THAT ONE.

15:53.236 --> 15:56.103
THE MAIN GOAL OF THIS IS TO
CATCH FUR TO MAKE MITTENS FOR

15:56.205 --> 16:00.274
MY HAND, AND IT'S ALSO
SOME PRETTY DARN GOOD FOOD.

16:06.416 --> 16:08.316
THAT'S HOW THICK THE ICE IS.

16:08.418 --> 16:09.583
NOT GOOD.

16:09.686 --> 16:12.353
BUT, THE FACT THAT THESE
HOLES ARE OPEN IS A HECK

16:12.455 --> 16:15.790
OF A GOOD SIGN.

16:15.892 --> 16:18.526
I PROBABLY HAVE A PRETTY
NARROW WINDOW OF TIME.

16:18.628 --> 16:19.427
CAN'T IMAGINE I'M
GONNA GET TOO MANY

16:19.529 --> 16:21.896
MORE DAYS OF TRAPPING,

16:21.998 --> 16:23.864
SO I'M GONNA TRY AND
MAXIMIZE IT PRETTY GOOD

16:23.967 --> 16:25.800
IN THE NEXT DAY OR TWO
BECAUSE I THINK MY DAYS ARE

16:25.902 --> 16:28.269
NUMBERED WITH THIS
PARTICULAR RESOURCE.

16:28.771 --> 16:31.672
LAST TRAP OF THE DAY.

16:34.210 --> 16:36.577
SO MY GLOVES ARE FROZEN SOLID.

16:36.679 --> 16:39.380
THE FINGERS INSIDE ARE
STARTING TO GET THAT WAY.

16:39.482 --> 16:40.982
ALL RIGHT, LET'S GO HOME.

16:41.084 --> 16:42.149
ATTABOYS.

16:42.285 --> 16:46.053
I'M COUNTING ON THESE MUSKRATS
TO BE ACTIVE AND HUNGRY.

16:52.428 --> 16:55.062
JESSIE HOLMES: MUSHING IS NOT
JUST A WINTER SPORT FOR ME,

16:55.164 --> 16:56.163
IT'S A LIFE.

16:56.265 --> 16:57.665
IT'S WHAT I DO EVERY DAY.

16:57.767 --> 17:01.202
AND THIS IS WHAT I
DO 365 DAYS A YEAR.

17:11.314 --> 17:13.981
IT'S TIME TO GET THE DOGS
LOADED UP AND ALL MY STUFF

17:14.083 --> 17:16.684
PACKED UP AND TRAVEL
DOWN TO CANTWELL.

17:16.786 --> 17:18.853
<i>NARRATOR: AFTER MONTHS</i>
<i>OF RELENTLESS TRAINING,</i>

17:18.955 --> 17:21.122
<i>TOMORROW WILL BE THE FIRST</i>
<i>SLED DOG RACE OF THE SEASON</i>

17:21.224 --> 17:24.525
<i>FOR JESSIE HOLMES AND HIS</i>

17:25.194 --> 17:27.395
JESSIE HOLMES: TODAY IS
A DAY OF NERVES FOR ME.

17:27.497 --> 17:28.729
AND I'M ALWAYS THIS
WAY BEFORE A RACE.

17:28.831 --> 17:30.231
ONCE I PULL THE HOOK AND
I'M OUT THERE WITH THE DOGS,

17:30.333 --> 17:33.134
AND THEY'RE BOOTED UP
AND THEY'RE HARNESSED UP,

17:33.236 --> 17:34.802
I KNOW EXACTLY WHAT TO DO.

17:34.904 --> 17:38.606
BUT THERE'S JUST SO MUCH TO
GET READY THAT IT'S A LITTLE

17:38.708 --> 17:41.275
UNNERVING SOMETIMES.

17:41.377 --> 17:44.045
DOGS LOADED UP, HIT THE ROAD.

17:44.781 --> 17:47.581
SIXTEEN DOGS IS
A TON OF POWER.

17:47.683 --> 17:49.583
IT'S LIKE A FREIGHT TRAIN.

17:49.685 --> 17:51.619
THEY GOT A LOT OF ENERGY,
THEY'RE READY TO GO.

17:54.390 --> 17:55.322
YOU KNOW, THE
WORK'S BEEN DONE.

17:55.425 --> 17:57.258
IT'S TIME TO GO SEE
HOW THE DOGS DO,

17:57.360 --> 17:59.560
AND THIS IS WHAT THEY LIVE
FOR AND WHAT I LIVE FOR, SO,

18:01.030 --> 18:03.130
IF IT'S SNOWING,
THEN I'M GOING.

18:03.733 --> 18:06.734
THE CONDITIONS ARE GONNA
BE PRETTY BAD DOWN THERE.

18:07.136 --> 18:08.869
THERE'S BEEN SNOW,
THERE'S DRIFTS.

18:08.971 --> 18:10.738
IT'S PREDICTED TO BE 30 BELOW.

18:10.840 --> 18:13.074
GONNA BE 90 MILES TO THE
STARTING LINE DOWN PAST

18:13.176 --> 18:16.043
CANTWELL, GOING DOWN
TO DO THE 65-MILE RACE.

18:16.145 --> 18:17.044
I DID IT LAST YEAR.

18:17.146 --> 18:18.479
I DIDN'T COME IN SO WELL.

18:18.581 --> 18:20.681
THIS YEAR, WITH THE MORE
MATURE DOG TEAM THAT I'VE

18:20.783 --> 18:24.385
WORKED WITH LONGER, I FEEL
CONFIDENT AND I'M GOING THERE

18:24.487 --> 18:26.487
TO TRY TO BE A
CONTENDER IN THIS RACE,

18:26.589 --> 18:29.557
WHICH WOULD MEAN TO ME
BEING IN THE TOP THREE.

18:29.659 --> 18:31.992
THIS IS 65 MILES OF
MOUNTAINOUS TRAILS.

18:32.095 --> 18:35.496
IF I CAN KEEP THE DOGS MOVING
REALLY GOOD ON THE UPHILLS,

18:35.598 --> 18:38.299
I THINK I CAN GET FIVE
HOURS ON THIS RACE.

18:38.734 --> 18:40.901
THAT WOULD BE RIGHT AT
AROUND 12 MILES AN HOUR.

18:41.003 --> 18:43.571
I THINK THAT'S A
VERY REALISTIC TIME.

18:44.507 --> 18:45.506
THE DOGS ARE READY.

18:45.608 --> 18:47.007
WE PUT THE HARD TRAINING IN.

18:47.110 --> 18:49.443
I FEEL CONFIDENT IN THEM
THAT WE CAN PUSH HARD AND

18:49.545 --> 18:50.811
GIVE 100% OUT THERE.

18:50.913 --> 18:53.981
SO, NO MATTER WHAT, HOW I
PLACE, IF I PLACE THIRD PLACE,

18:54.083 --> 18:55.449
I'M GONNA BE HAPPY
BECAUSE WE'RE OUT THERE,

18:55.551 --> 18:58.919
WE'RE GIVING IT ALL WE GOT,
AND WE'RE GETTING BETTER EVERY

18:59.021 --> 19:01.088
TIME WE RACE.

19:02.859 --> 19:04.358
ALL RIGHT, WE'RE HERE
IN THE DENALI HIGHWAY.

19:04.460 --> 19:07.528
FIRST THING I GOT TO
DO IS GET THESE DOGS OUT,

19:07.630 --> 19:08.462
LET 'EM RUN AROUND,
CHECK 'EM OUT,

19:08.564 --> 19:10.564
MAKE SURE THEY'RE DOING GOOD.

19:10.666 --> 19:12.800
WE'RE HERE EARLY, WE
GOT PLENTY OF TIME.

19:12.902 --> 19:14.268
I GOT A GOOD TIME TO
GET A GOOD REST TONIGHT.

19:14.370 --> 19:16.537
THESE DOGS LOOK GREAT.

19:16.639 --> 19:18.038
WE'RE READY TO RACE, MAN.

19:18.141 --> 19:21.575
I'M THE ONLY RACER HERE RIGHT
NOW, AND I'M THAT MUCH AHEAD,

19:21.677 --> 19:24.178
BECAUSE I'M HERE
AND I'M READY TO GO.

19:24.280 --> 19:27.248
I'M TURNING IN FOR THE NIGHT,
AND TOMORROW'S A NEW DAY.

19:27.350 --> 19:29.283
TOMORROW'S OUR DAY TO
SHOW ALL THE HARD WORK THAT

19:29.385 --> 19:30.718
WE'VE DONE THIS WINTER.

19:30.820 --> 19:33.454
I'M JUST GONNA HAVE TO TRY
TO QUIET MY MIND, AND WIND DOWN,

19:33.556 --> 19:34.555
AND GET SOME
MUCH NEEDED SLEEP.

19:34.657 --> 19:36.524
I'M GONNA NEED
THAT ENERGY RUNNING UP

19:36.626 --> 19:38.759
THESE HILLS TOMORROW.

19:46.035 --> 19:47.601
GLENN VILLENEUVE: ONE THING
I'VE LEARNED OVER THE YEARS,

19:47.703 --> 19:49.470
PERSISTENCE AND
PATIENCE PAY OFF.

19:49.572 --> 19:52.773
OUT HERE, YOU CAN'T
EXPECT INSTANT RESULTS.

20:02.451 --> 20:04.752
¶ ¶

20:04.854 --> 20:05.986
I'M GETTING CLOSE NOW.

20:06.088 --> 20:08.656
THIS IS WHERE I FOUND
THE BEAVERS LAST SPRING.

20:08.758 --> 20:10.925
RIGHT UP HERE.

20:12.795 --> 20:15.062
<i>NARRATOR: GLENN HAS HIKED</i>
<i>SEVEN MILES FROM HIS CABIN TO</i>

20:15.164 --> 20:17.565

<i>HE'LL BE FORCED</i>
<i>TO FIND SHELTER IN</i>

20:27.610 --> 20:29.677
<i>BONE CHILLING CONDITIONS.</i>

20:30.279 --> 20:31.779
GLENN VILLENEUVE: NOW
I HAVE TO BE CAREFUL.

20:31.881 --> 20:34.014
SOMETIMES, THERE
CAN BE THIN ICE.

20:34.116 --> 20:35.916
THE BEAVERS ARE COMING OUT
OF THEIR LODGE AND THEY'RE

20:36.018 --> 20:37.184
SWIMMING AROUND UNDER THE ICE.

20:37.286 --> 20:39.320
A LOT OF TIMES, THEY'LL
GO IN THE SAME PATH BACK

20:39.422 --> 20:41.255
AND FORTH TO THEIR FOOD PILE.

20:41.357 --> 20:43.390
AND THE ICE THERE WILL
BE REAL THIN WHERE THEY'RE

20:43.492 --> 20:45.659
BLOWING UP THE AIR BUBBLES.

20:45.761 --> 20:47.127
THIS IS THE BEAVER LODGE.

20:47.230 --> 20:49.597
IT'S JUST A DOME-SHAPED HOUSE
BUILT OUT OF STICKS AND MUD,

20:50.900 --> 20:54.201
AND THEY HAVE A TUNNEL
UNDERNEATH THE ICE HERE.

20:54.303 --> 20:57.071
RIGHT HERE, I'M GONNA
CHISEL A HOLE, PUT MY BAIT,

20:57.173 --> 20:59.273
AND SET MY SNARES.

21:01.077 --> 21:03.777
IF I CATCH A GOOD BEAVER
IN HERE, IT'LL GIVE ME FUR,

21:03.879 --> 21:05.746
AND IT'LL GIVE
ME MEAT AND FAT.

21:05.848 --> 21:07.514
BEAVER ARE A VERY
USEFUL ANIMAL,

21:07.617 --> 21:08.716
BUT THEY'RE NOT VERY
COMMON IN THIS COUNTRY.

21:08.818 --> 21:11.919
YOU GOT TO LOOK LONG
AND HARD TO FIND ONE.

21:15.391 --> 21:17.458
THERE, I HIT WATER.

21:17.660 --> 21:19.960
YEAH, LOOK AT THAT.

21:20.463 --> 21:21.662
WHOO.

21:21.764 --> 21:23.230
A LOT OF WORK CHISELING
A HOLE THROUGH THIS ICE.

21:23.332 --> 21:26.500
THAT'S WHAT YOU GOT TO DO
IF YOU WANNA CATCH A BEAVER.

21:26.702 --> 21:27.601
I NEED TO GET SOME
SPRUCE POLES THEN I CAN SET

21:27.703 --> 21:29.770
THE SNARE THERE.

21:29.872 --> 21:33.874
I'D LIKE TO GET A DEAD SPRUCE
TREE THAT I CAN PUT DOWN IN

21:33.976 --> 21:36.610
THERE, AND ATTACH MY BAIT TO.

21:43.552 --> 21:45.119
BEAVER LIVE ON BARK,
AND IN THE WINTERTIME,

21:45.221 --> 21:48.455
THEY HAVE STICKS THAT THEY'VE
STORED UNDERNEATH THE ICE.

21:48.557 --> 21:50.291
HERE'S MY ASPEN BAIT.

21:50.393 --> 21:51.759
BEAVER REALLY LIKE ASPEN.

21:51.861 --> 21:55.129
WHEN THE BEAVERS SMELL THIS,
IT'S GONNA BE LIKE A DELICACY,

21:55.231 --> 21:56.497
AND HOPEFULLY, THEY'RE GONNA
COME OVER AND GET CAUGHT IN

21:56.599 --> 21:59.700
ONE OF MY SNARES WHEN
THEY TRY TO GET IT.

21:59.802 --> 22:01.702
ALL RIGHT, THERE'S MY BAIT.

22:01.804 --> 22:04.838
NOW, I'LL PUT IT
DOWN IN THE WATER.

22:05.141 --> 22:08.809
AND NOW, I'M GOING TO
MAKE A CROSS RIGHT HERE,

22:08.911 --> 22:10.878
AND HANG MY SNARES
DOWN IN THE WATER RIGHT

22:10.980 --> 22:11.712
AROUND THE BAIT.

22:11.814 --> 22:13.847
HERE ARE MY SNARES.

22:13.949 --> 22:15.382
THIS LOOP OF WIRE RIGHT
HERE IS JUST THE RIGHT SIZE

22:15.484 --> 22:17.651
TO CATCH A BEAVER.

22:17.753 --> 22:19.219
WHEN I PUT IT DOWN
THERE BY THE BAIT,

22:19.322 --> 22:23.857
THE BEAVER COMES SWIMMING
ALONG, SWIMS THROUGH THIS,

22:23.959 --> 22:25.626
AND GETS CAUGHT.

22:32.468 --> 22:34.468
THERE, OKAY, I GOT
FOUR SNARES ON HERE NOW,

22:34.570 --> 22:37.638
AND NOW I'M GONNA LOWER
ALL FOUR SNARES DOWN

22:37.740 --> 22:39.606
INTO THE WATER.

22:41.277 --> 22:43.043
I GOT MY SNARES SET.

22:43.145 --> 22:45.279
I'M TOO TIRED TO WALK
ALL THE WAY BACK TO CAMP.

22:45.381 --> 22:46.714
I'LL SPEND THE
NIGHT RIGHT HERE.

22:46.816 --> 22:48.449
I'LL BUILD MYSELF A SHELTER,
AND THEN I CAN CHECK THIS IN

22:48.551 --> 22:51.719
THE MORNING BEFORE
I HEAD BACK TO CAMP.

22:53.055 --> 22:55.222
SUE AIKENS: YOU KNOW, NATURE
NEVER REALLY GIVES UP HER

22:55.324 --> 22:56.523
PRIZES WILLINGLY.

22:56.625 --> 22:59.026
YOU'VE GOT TO WORK FOR
EACH AND EVERY ONE OF 'EM.

23:04.800 --> 23:06.433
ANOTHER BIG DAY FOR
THE SHEEPIE HUNT AND

23:06.535 --> 23:09.403
SUE'S ARCTIC EXTRAVAGANZA.

23:09.505 --> 23:11.238
YESTERDAY, I TRIED TO GET ON
THE SHEEP THAT WERE OVER HERE

23:11.340 --> 23:15.576
TO THE NORTH ON THE HILL,
BUT LOTS OF WATER EVERYWHERE.

23:16.011 --> 23:18.212
I COULD NOT CROSS
THIS WAY, BACKTRACKED,

23:18.314 --> 23:20.748
GOT A LITTLE FURTHTH,
COULD NOT CROSS AGAIN.

23:20.850 --> 23:24.385
IT IS IMPOSSIBLE FOR ME TO GET
THROUGH SO MANY DEEP CHANNELS

23:24.487 --> 23:25.819
OF THE RIVER TO GET TO 'EM.

23:25.921 --> 23:28.288
IF I LOOK ON THE TOPO MAP,
WHAT YOU SEE DOWN THERE,

23:28.391 --> 23:32.693
IT'S A BIG HILL, AND I'VE
GOT TO JUST KIND OF SCALE IT.

23:34.930 --> 23:36.530
NEW AREA.

23:36.632 --> 23:37.998
NEW DAY.

23:38.100 --> 23:40.100
HOPEFULLY, NEW LUCK.

23:41.404 --> 23:44.571
SO TODAY'S GOAL
IS TO GO SOUTH.

23:44.673 --> 23:46.206
<i>NARRATOR: WITH</i>
<i>TEMPERATURES DROPPING,</i>

23:46.308 --> 23:49.143
<i>SUE'S DAYS IN THE</i>
<i>REFUGE COULD BE LIMITED,</i>

23:49.245 --> 23:50.377
<i>AND SHE MUST TAKE</i>
<i>ADVANTAGE OF THE OPPORTUNITY</i>

23:50.479 --> 23:52.813
<i>TO HUNT SHEEP.</i>

23:52.915 --> 23:54.915
SUE AIKENS: THIS IS
NOT A TERRAIN I DEAL MUCH

23:55.017 --> 23:56.350
WITH IN KAVIK.

23:56.452 --> 23:58.852
BUT IT'S WHAT I'VE GOT TO DEAL
WITH IF I WANNA TRY AND FIND

23:58.954 --> 24:02.089
SHEEP OR ANYTHING ELSE.

24:05.294 --> 24:09.363
PART OF THIS TRIP IS
FOR ME TO EXAMINE WHERE

24:09.465 --> 24:10.664
I'M AT IN LIFE.

24:10.766 --> 24:12.366
DO WE NOT ALL DO THAT?

24:12.468 --> 24:14.301
I'M FAT, FIFTIES,
AND OUT OF SHAPE.

24:14.403 --> 24:15.436
CAN I EVEN MAKE IT
UP THE SCREE FIELD?

24:15.538 --> 24:17.604
CAN I SKIRT AROUND IT?

24:17.706 --> 24:18.605
SHEEP LIVE HIGH.

24:18.707 --> 24:21.508
THEY DON'T USUALLY LIVE LOW.

24:21.777 --> 24:25.345
AND IN THIS ROCKY CRAG SYSTEM
UP HERE, RIGHT UP THERE,

24:25.448 --> 24:27.481
I THOUGHT I SAW
A BIG OLD SHEEPIE.

24:27.583 --> 24:29.616
SO, I'M TRYING
TO GET UP THERE.

24:29.718 --> 24:32.052
HE'S GOT NOWHERE
ELSE TO GO BUT DOWN,

24:32.154 --> 24:35.222
SO IF HE IS UP THERE,
MAYBE I'LL, MAYBE I'LL GET HIM.

24:35.324 --> 24:37.825
FOR HUNTERS, IT
IS THE PINNACLE.

24:37.927 --> 24:41.061
IT IS THE ANIMAL YOU PIT
YOURSELF AGAINST WHEN YOU

24:41.163 --> 24:43.363
WANNA KNOW YOUR
INTELLIGENCE LEVEL.

24:43.466 --> 24:46.967
YOUR ABILITY TO
OUTGUESS YOUR OPPONENT.

24:47.069 --> 24:48.535
(BLEEP).

24:53.375 --> 24:55.342
THOUGHT I HEARD HIM.

24:55.444 --> 24:56.944
HE'S RIGHT UP THERE.

24:57.046 --> 24:59.713
I DON'T KNOW THAT
I CAN, I DON'T,

24:59.815 --> 25:03.684
THERE'S NOWHERE
FOR ME TO PUT THIS.

25:07.490 --> 25:09.089
<i>[GUNSHOT]</i>

25:20.135 --> 25:21.034
<i>[GUNSHOT]</i>

25:21.136 --> 25:22.636
(BLEEP).

25:27.777 --> 25:29.276
<i>[GUNSHOT]</i>

25:29.378 --> 25:31.846
SUE AIKENS: (BLEEP).

25:34.016 --> 25:35.749
<i>[GUNSHOT]</i>

25:40.723 --> 25:44.758
WELL, THAT BLOWS THAT ONE.

25:45.361 --> 25:46.427
I THINK MY SHEEP
ARE LONG GONE.

25:46.529 --> 25:49.630
I GET FRUSTRATED.

25:51.567 --> 25:53.968
AND I KNEW I SAW THE
DAMN SHEEP UP THERE,

25:54.070 --> 25:56.503
AND I TRIED TO SHOOT
HIM, AND I WAS JUST THAT

25:56.606 --> 25:59.373
LITTLE TINY BIT OFF.

26:00.343 --> 26:03.544
SEEMS LIKE I GET THWARTED
EVERY (BLEEP) CHANCE I GET.

26:06.182 --> 26:07.381
ONE OF THE SMARTEST
DAMN ANIMALS,

26:07.483 --> 26:10.284
AND MAJESTIC ANIMALS
ON THE PLANET,

26:10.853 --> 26:16.957
AND I GET THREE SHOTS
OFF ON HIM, AND, IN THE END,

26:17.393 --> 26:20.628
THIS COUNTRY IS GONNA
WIN IF I DON'T GET MY ASS

26:20.730 --> 26:22.229
DOWN THE HILL.

26:22.331 --> 26:23.397
WHAT AM I FACING?

26:23.499 --> 26:24.865
THE SUN IS GOING DOWN.

26:24.967 --> 26:25.799
IT IS GETTING MARKEDLY COLDER.

26:25.902 --> 26:28.636
THIS IS ICY, IT IS DANGEROUS.

26:28.738 --> 26:29.503
THE SHEEP ARE GONNA
LIVE TO SEE ANOTHER DAY,

26:29.605 --> 26:31.505
I'VE GOT TO AS WELL.

26:31.607 --> 26:34.975
HUNTING IS ABOUT THE
OPPORTUNITY TO DO IT,

26:35.077 --> 26:36.677
NOT THE GUARANTEE THAT
YOU'RE GONNA GET IT.

26:40.416 --> 26:42.283
ANDY BASSICH: IT'S A
NEVER-ENDING LEARNING PROCESS

26:42.385 --> 26:47.121
AND A NEVER-ENDING QUEST TO
USE THE RESOURCES AROUND HERE

26:47.223 --> 26:49.490
TO BE SELF-SUFFICIENT,
AND THAT'S WHY I LIKE

26:49.592 --> 26:50.691
LIVING OUT HERE.

27:00.202 --> 27:03.737
¶ ¶

27:03.839 --> 27:06.240
TODAY, I'M JUST GONNA
TAKE MY PUPPIES BACK TO THE

27:06.342 --> 27:08.142
LAKE TO CHECK MUSKRAT SETS.

27:08.244 --> 27:11.679
I'VE GOT ABOUT SIX MUSKRAT
SETS ALREADY MADE YESTERDAY.

27:13.149 --> 27:14.748
COUPLE OF 'EM LOOKED
REALLY PROMISING,

27:14.850 --> 27:16.150
THE HOLES WERE STILL OPEN.

27:16.252 --> 27:18.319
I'M REALLY HOPING I'M GONNA
PULL A FEW MUSKRATS OUT

27:18.421 --> 27:19.320
OF THE ICE.

27:19.422 --> 27:20.554
COME HERE, KRUG.

27:20.656 --> 27:22.489
I'M GONNA GO HARNESS
UP KRUGGERAND.

27:22.591 --> 27:24.024
I'M GONNA GATHER
UP THE PUPPIES.

27:24.126 --> 27:25.526
I'M GONNA GO BACK TO THE
LAKE, CHECK THE TRAPS,

27:25.628 --> 27:29.797
AND HOPEFULLY, COME HOME WITH
SOME MUSKRAT FOR MUSKRAT STEW

27:29.899 --> 27:31.632
AND MUSKRAT MITTENS.

27:32.101 --> 27:35.402
YEAH, LOOK, ATTABOY, GOOD BOY.

27:35.705 --> 27:38.305
MY DOG KENNEL'S DOWN TO
10 WORKING DOGS RIGHT NOW.

27:38.407 --> 27:41.275
COUPLE OF 'EM ARE GETTING
OLD AND WILL RETIRE SOON,

27:41.377 --> 27:44.378
SO I JUST ADDED TWO NEW
PUPPIES TO THE MIX THIS YEAR.

27:44.480 --> 27:46.013
YEAH, GOOD JOB.

27:46.115 --> 27:47.514
THIS YEAR IS KIND OF UNIQUE
IN THAT I DON'T HAVE MUCH SNOW

27:47.616 --> 27:49.883
FOR TRAINING THE DOGS.

27:49.986 --> 27:52.152
IT'S REALLY THROWING
A MONKEY WRENCH INTO

27:52.254 --> 27:53.220
MY TRAINING EFFORTS,

27:53.322 --> 27:56.090
SO WHAT I'M DOING IS I'M
CUTTING MY DOGS LOOSE AND

27:56.192 --> 27:58.892
I'M JUST GOING FOR
WALKS ALONG THE RIVER,

27:58.995 --> 28:00.327
OUT ON THE LAKE,

28:00.429 --> 28:03.364
AND IT'S PRETTY
MUCH JUST PLAYTIME.

28:03.699 --> 28:04.932
LOOK AT THEM PUPPERS.

28:05.034 --> 28:07.201
THEY SAY, "OH, THERE
IS A MUSKRAT IN THERE.

28:07.303 --> 28:08.669
THERE'S A MUSKRAT IN THERE."

28:08.771 --> 28:11.472
ALL RIGHT, LET'S SEE IF
WE GOT A MUSKRAT IN HERE.

28:11.574 --> 28:14.408
UH-OH, I DON'T KNOW.

28:15.344 --> 28:20.114
WHOA, IT GOT SNAPPED,
BUT NOTHING GOT CAUGHT.

28:20.216 --> 28:21.215
THAT'S A COOL SIGN.

28:21.350 --> 28:25.052
I LIKE THE FACT THAT
SOMETHING SET THAT TRAP OFF.

28:25.154 --> 28:26.887
MEANS THEY'RE HUNGRY
AND THEY'RE OUT.

28:26.989 --> 28:28.355
THAT TRAP, IT WAS
QUITE A WAYS DOWN,

28:28.457 --> 28:30.190
SO I THINK I'M GONNA MOVE IT
UP TO WHERE IT'S RIGHT AT THE

28:30.292 --> 28:33.727
BOTTOM OF THE ICE, AND THEN
THEY HAVE TO GO THROUGH THE

28:33.829 --> 28:35.796
TRAP TO COME OUT OF THE HOLE.

28:35.898 --> 28:39.233
ALL RIGHT, LIKE THAT.

28:39.502 --> 28:43.103
ONTO THE NEXT ONE.

28:43.706 --> 28:45.439
GIVE ME SOME
MUSKRAT LOVE HERE.

28:45.541 --> 28:48.075
IT FEELS PRETTY LIGHT.

28:48.177 --> 28:50.110
NOPE, THAT ONE
DIDN'T GET SET OFF.

28:50.212 --> 28:51.712
OH, DID IT?

28:51.814 --> 28:52.713
YEAH, IT DID.

28:52.815 --> 28:54.715
THAT ONE GOT SET OFF, TOO.

28:54.817 --> 28:59.253
TWO TRAPS CHECKED, TWO
TRAPS SET OFF, NO FUR.

28:59.355 --> 29:01.989
SO, I'M GONNA GO
ONTO THE NEXT ONES.

29:08.831 --> 29:09.797
NOTHING.

29:09.899 --> 29:11.465
GOT SET OFF AGAIN THOUGH.

29:11.567 --> 29:14.768
DEFINITELY COMING
INTO THESE SETS.

29:14.870 --> 29:16.403
I THINK I MIGHT SWITCH
THIS ONE UP WITH A LEG-HOLD

29:16.505 --> 29:18.672
TRAP THIS TIME.

29:18.774 --> 29:21.875
SAME IDEA AS THE CONIBEARS,
ONLY THE TRAPS WILL BE SET

29:21.977 --> 29:24.244
PRETTY CLOSE TO THE
TOP OF THE WATER.

29:24.346 --> 29:27.681
IT'S HUMBLING TO BE OUTSMARTED
BY A MUSKRAT, THAT'S FOR SURE.

29:27.983 --> 29:31.485
BUT EVERYTHING ABOUT LIVING
OUT HERE IS HUMBLING.

29:31.720 --> 29:32.719
CLOSE THIS ONE UP.

29:32.822 --> 29:35.656
SEE IF I CAN OUTSMART
'EM TOMORROW.

29:35.858 --> 29:40.127
SO FAR, IT'S MUSKRATS
THREE, AND ANDY ZIP.

29:42.164 --> 29:43.464
NOTHING.

29:44.400 --> 29:47.501
LOTS OF DEBRIS COMING UP
THROUGH, BUT NO MUSKRATS.

29:48.404 --> 29:51.071
SO IT'S KIND OF FRUSTRATING
THAT I'M GETTING OUTSMARTED BY

29:51.173 --> 29:53.640
A MUSKRAT, BUT THE FACT
THAT I'M GETTING OUTSMARTED

29:53.742 --> 29:55.843
BY A MUSKRAT MEANS THAT
THEY'RE THERE.

29:55.945 --> 29:58.145
IT MEANS SOONER OR LATER,
I'M GONNA CONNECT HERE.

29:58.247 --> 29:59.847
I THINK I MIGHT
DOUBLE SET THIS ONE.

29:59.949 --> 30:02.116
I THINK I MIGHT PUT THE
CONIBEAR DOWN AT THE BOTTOM

30:02.218 --> 30:04.518
AND THEN I'LL PUT THE
FOOTHOLD TRAP UP NEAR THE TOP.

30:04.987 --> 30:07.621
DOUBLE MY CHANCES HERE.

30:09.091 --> 30:12.759
SURE WISH I COULD CURL UP
ON A COLD LAKE LIKE THAT.

30:12.862 --> 30:15.395
OH, YOU GUYS LOOK PRETTY
COMFORTABLE THERE.

30:15.498 --> 30:18.232
EVERYBODY'S PILED
UP ON EACH OTHER.

30:18.334 --> 30:19.967
LET'S PILE UP AND GO HOME.

30:20.069 --> 30:21.401
WE GOT SKUNKED.

30:21.504 --> 30:22.536
STRAIGHT AHEAD, LET'S GO.

30:22.638 --> 30:25.139
HAW, HAW.

30:25.241 --> 30:27.274
ATTABOYS, STRAIGHT AHEAD.

30:28.944 --> 30:30.110
GLENN VILLENEUVE:
WHEN I'VE BEEN OUT HERE,

30:30.212 --> 30:32.279
AND SOME MISFORTUNE
HAS BEFALLEN ME,

30:32.381 --> 30:34.781
AND I'VE BEEN ABLE TO OVERCOME
IT AND DEAL WITH IT MYSELF,

30:34.884 --> 30:37.351
I FIND THAT SATISFYING.

30:41.624 --> 30:43.390
IT'S GETTING COLDER.

30:43.492 --> 30:45.659
IT'S DOWN TO 44 BELOW NOW.

30:45.761 --> 30:47.694
IT'S GONNA BE A COLD NIGHT.

30:47.796 --> 30:49.763
I'VE GOT TO FIND A
PLACE TO MAKE A SHELTER.

30:50.633 --> 30:51.765
IT'S SIX OR SEVEN
MILES BACK HOME.

30:51.867 --> 30:54.401
I DON'T HAVE ENERGY TO
WALK THAT FAR TONIGHT.

30:54.503 --> 30:58.272
RIGHT UP HERE, I BUILT THIS
LITTLE SPRUCE POLE TEEPEE

30:58.374 --> 31:00.541
SHELTER UP HERE LAST SPRING.

31:00.643 --> 31:01.909
THERE IT IS.

31:02.011 --> 31:03.677
IT'S STILL STANDING,
THAT'S GOOD.

31:03.779 --> 31:05.546
IT'S NOT REALLY GOOD
FOR COLD WEATHER,

31:05.648 --> 31:06.513
BUT MAYBE I CAN USE
THE MATERIALS IN IT.

31:06.615 --> 31:08.382
I'M GLAD I FOUND THIS PLACE.

31:08.484 --> 31:10.517
I BUILT THIS LITTLE SHELTER
LAST SPRING WHEN I WAS

31:10.619 --> 31:11.818
EXPLORING THE AREA BY CANOE.

31:11.921 --> 31:13.320
IT'S GONNA COME
IN HANDY TONIGHT.

31:13.422 --> 31:14.788
IT'S GETTING BRUTALLY COLD.

31:14.890 --> 31:17.391
IT'S DOWN TO 44 BELOW,
AND I'VE GOTTA SPEND THE

31:17.493 --> 31:18.825
NIGHT OUT HERE.

31:18.928 --> 31:20.727
I DID BRING MY SLEEPING BAG,
BUT I DON'T HAVE MUCH ELSE.

31:21.697 --> 31:23.597
I'LL HAVE TO MODIFY THIS.

31:23.699 --> 31:24.498
FIRST OF ALL,
I DEFINITELY WANNA BE ABLE

31:24.600 --> 31:26.533
TO CLOSE THIS OFF.

31:26.635 --> 31:28.902
I WANNA BE ABLE TO KEEP
SOME HEAT IN THERE.

31:31.240 --> 31:35.275
EVERY TIME I EXHALE, I CAN
HEAR MY BREATH FREEZING.

31:36.812 --> 31:38.445
I'M GONNA HAVE TO MAKE USE
OF SOME NATURAL MATERIALS.

31:38.547 --> 31:42.082
LOOKING AROUND FOR
SOME SPRUCE TREES.

31:42.451 --> 31:44.751
HERE'S ONE I CAN USE.

31:46.021 --> 31:50.057
<i>[SAWING]</i>

31:57.166 --> 31:59.266
OKAY.

31:59.368 --> 32:00.968
I GOT ENOUGH
SPRUCE TREES ON IT.

32:01.070 --> 32:03.503
NOW, I'LL JUST SHOVEL
A LITTLE MORE SNOW.

32:03.606 --> 32:05.072
SNOW IS A REALLY
GOOD INSULATOR,

32:05.174 --> 32:08.575
AND IT WILL BREAK THE WIND,
FILL SOME OF THE GAPS.

32:08.811 --> 32:11.144
EVERY LITTLE BIT HELPS
WHEN IT'S 44 BELOW.

32:11.247 --> 32:13.780
IT'S IMPORTANT TO KNOW WHAT
YOU CAN USE OUT HERE WHEN YOU

32:13.882 --> 32:14.948
NEED TO TO SURVIVE.

32:15.050 --> 32:18.018
A LITTLE BIT OF KNOWLEDGE
GOES A LONG WAYS.

32:18.120 --> 32:19.686
IF YOU CURLED UP UNDER A
SPRUCE TREE AND DIDN'T HAVE

32:19.788 --> 32:21.221
ANY SHELTER, YOU
MIGHT FREEZE TO DEATH.

32:21.323 --> 32:24.958
SOMETIMES IT'S HAPPENED,
PEOPLE HAVE DIED OF EXPOSURE

32:25.060 --> 32:26.627
BECAUSE THEY JUST
DIDN'T REALIZE,

32:26.729 --> 32:28.395
IF YOU KNOW HOW TO
USE SIMPLE MATERIALS.

32:28.497 --> 32:30.197
THE SPRUCE POLES, THE SNOW.

32:30.299 --> 32:32.733
PUT IT TOGETHER THE RIGHT
WAY, YOU CAN ACTUALLY SURVIVE,

32:33.035 --> 32:34.668
EVEN WHEN IT'S 44 BELOW ZERO.

32:37.172 --> 32:38.972
I REMEMBER WHEN I WAS A LITTLE
KID GROWING UP IN VERMONT,

32:39.074 --> 32:41.541
SOMETIMES I'D GO OUT IN
THE WINTER AND I'D DIG INTO

32:41.644 --> 32:42.876
THE SNOW BANK
BESIDE THE HOUSE,

32:42.978 --> 32:47.247
MAKE A LITTLE SHELTER AND
SLEEP OUT THERE FOR A WHILE.

32:47.349 --> 32:49.349
NEVER KNEW I WAS GONNA BE
BUILDING SHELTERS LIKE THIS

32:49.451 --> 32:52.286
ALMOST 40 YEARS LATER.

32:52.388 --> 32:53.720
THERE.

32:53.822 --> 32:57.758
I GOT ENOUGH SNOW ON IT
NOW, I'M READY TO MOVE IN.

32:59.094 --> 32:59.826
NICE.

32:59.928 --> 33:03.163
TIME TO GET SOME REST.

33:08.370 --> 33:10.704
THE AIR IN THIS SLEEPING
BAG IS FORTY BELOW ZERO,

33:10.806 --> 33:13.974
BUT I'M STARTING TO
WARM IT UP WITH MY BODY.

33:16.545 --> 33:18.078
OH, I'M GLAD I
HAVE THIS SHELTER.

33:18.180 --> 33:20.981
IF I WAS OUT IN THE OPEN,
IT'D JUST BE TORTUROUS.

33:21.083 --> 33:22.849
I'LL GET UP TOMORROW,
CHECK MY SNARES,

33:22.951 --> 33:26.086
THEN HEAD BACK TO CAMP.

33:28.123 --> 33:30.324
JESSIE HOLMES: THERE'S NOT
A DAY IN DOG MUSHING WHERE

33:30.426 --> 33:31.558
YOU'RE NOT LEARNING SOMETHING.

33:31.660 --> 33:33.327
IF YOU'RE NOT LEARNING
SOMETHING EVERY DAY AS A

33:33.429 --> 33:35.662
DOG MUSHER, THEN
YOU'RE STAGNANT.

33:35.864 --> 33:38.165
YOU'RE NOT GROWING.

33:41.603 --> 33:43.804
IT'S TIME TO GET THE
DOGS READY TO HOOK UP.

33:43.906 --> 33:46.340
THE FIRST THING I'M GONNA
DO IS GET SOME BOOTS ON 'EM.

33:46.542 --> 33:48.275
<i>NARRATOR: JESSIE HAS TRAVELED</i>
<i>90 MILES FROM HIS HOME IN</i>

33:48.377 --> 33:52.412
<i>NENANA TO CANTWELL, WHERE</i>
<i>HE'LL RUN HIS FIRST SLED DOG</i>

33:52.514 --> 33:55.048
<i>RACE OF THE SEASON.</i>

33:55.150 --> 33:58.752
<i>BUT AFTER REPAIRING HIS</i>
<i>SLED BRAKE AT THE 11TH HOUR,</i>

33:58.854 --> 34:01.922
<i>JESSIE'S ABILITY TO CONTROL</i>
<i>THE POWER OF HIS 16-DOG TEAM</i>

34:02.024 --> 34:04.624
<i>WILL BE TESTED ON THE</i>
<i>FROZEN 65-MILE TRAIL.</i>

34:05.894 --> 34:07.661
JESSIE HOLMES:
16-DOG LIMIT IN THIS RACE.

34:07.763 --> 34:10.230
IN ALL HONESTY, THAT'S
PRETTY LARGE LIMIT FOR A

34:10.332 --> 34:12.999
SHORT RACE LIKE THIS.

34:13.102 --> 34:15.435
WHAT THAT DOES IS GIVES ME
AN OPPORTUNITY TO BRING MY

34:15.537 --> 34:18.472
16 BEST DOGS AND THEN BENEFIT
FROM WORKING TOGETHER AND

34:18.574 --> 34:22.442
TRAINING TOGETHER
AND RACING TOGETHER.

34:22.544 --> 34:23.643
BUT THEY'RE LOOKING GOOD.

34:23.746 --> 34:24.878
THEY'RE READY TO GO.

34:24.980 --> 34:26.246
THEY'RE NOT WORRIED
ABOUT THE WIND.

34:26.348 --> 34:29.049
BUT I'M A LITTLE APPREHENSIVE
OF IT, IT'S PRETTY WINDY.

34:29.685 --> 34:31.952
ALL RIGHT, STRAIGHT
AHEAD, STRAIGHT AHEAD.

34:41.063 --> 34:42.229
THERE'S A LOT OF POWER
IN THESE 16 DOGS.

34:42.331 --> 34:45.732
THEY'RE RUNNING REALLY
GOOD, RIGHT UP THE START.

34:46.635 --> 34:48.869
I TRAINED ALL WINTER FOR THIS.

34:48.971 --> 34:50.937
I FEEL LIKE THESE DOGS GOT
A GREAT SHOT AT WINNING THIS

34:51.039 --> 34:54.307
RACE IF I CAN JUST
MANAGE THEM CORRECTLY.

34:57.379 --> 35:00.814
WHOA, EASY, EASY!

35:01.517 --> 35:03.917
WE'RE COMING DOWN
SOME PRETTY BIG HILLS.

35:04.019 --> 35:05.285
THEY'RE REALLY
STEEP AND THE DOGS,

35:05.387 --> 35:08.255
I CAN'T REALLY GET ANY
BRAKING POWER WITH THE BRAKES,

35:08.357 --> 35:09.623
HARD AS I'M STANDING ON IT,

35:09.725 --> 35:11.725
I CANNOT SLOW 'EM
DOWN ENOUGH.

35:14.530 --> 35:16.997
EASY.

35:17.332 --> 35:20.600
I JUST CAN'T SLOW THESE
DOGS DOWN ON THESE DOWNHILLS

35:20.702 --> 35:22.102
WITH THIS BRAKE.

35:22.204 --> 35:24.504
THEY'RE GOING 17, 18
MILES AN HOUR WHEN I NEED TO

35:24.606 --> 35:25.839
BE GOING 12.

35:25.941 --> 35:29.042
THIS COULD NOT WORK OUT
THAT GOOD BECAUSE STARTING

35:29.144 --> 35:31.611
OUT FAST USUALLY
EQUALS FINISHING SLOW.

35:33.248 --> 35:34.581
STRAIGHT AHEAD.

35:36.652 --> 35:38.618
MY GOAL WAS TO GO OUT
SLOW AND FINISH FAST.

35:39.922 --> 35:43.323
SO I'M GONNA HAVE TO JUST
GO FOR IT AT THIS POINT.

35:50.199 --> 35:52.499
I'VE ALREADY PASSED THREE
TEAMS AND NOW I'M COMING UP ON

35:52.601 --> 35:55.435
THE LEADER OF THE RACE.

35:55.537 --> 35:57.003
STRAIGHT AHEAD.

35:57.105 --> 35:59.072
RIGHT, STRAIGHT AHEAD.

35:59.174 --> 36:00.507
ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT,
RIGHT, STRAIGHT AHEAD.

36:00.609 --> 36:03.643
STRAIGHT AHEAD, ALL RIGHT,
HEY, KNOCK THAT OFF.

36:04.846 --> 36:06.479
ALL RIGHT.

36:06.581 --> 36:08.014
HEY, KNOCK THAT OFF!

36:08.116 --> 36:09.015
GET UP THERE.

36:09.117 --> 36:11.150
STRAIGHT AHEAD.

36:11.253 --> 36:15.121
HUP, YEAH!

36:25.533 --> 36:27.901
I'M NOT GONNA GIVE IT TO
MYSELF TILL THE FINISH LINE,

36:28.003 --> 36:30.236
BUT I GOT A LOT OF
CONFIDENCE IN THIS TEAM.

36:39.915 --> 36:41.314
THEY'RE DRIVING HARD.

36:41.416 --> 36:44.183
I'M SCARED TO DEATH BACK HERE,
JUST TRYING TO HANG ON TO 'EM,

36:44.286 --> 36:45.585
AND THAT'S THE KIND
OF DOG TEAM I'VE ALWAYS

36:45.687 --> 36:47.020
BEEN LOOKING TO HAVE.

36:47.122 --> 36:49.122
IF I DON'T HAVE A LITTLE BIT
OF FEAR TRYING TO HANG ON TO

36:49.224 --> 36:50.623
THESE DOGS, THEN THEY'RE
NOT GONNA BE POWERFUL ENOUGH

36:50.725 --> 36:54.060
TO BE CHAMPIONS.

37:01.903 --> 37:04.804
GOOD DOGS, STRAIGHT AHEAD.

37:07.208 --> 37:09.642
MAN: THERE HE IS,
HERE THEY COME.

37:09.744 --> 37:11.644
LOOK AT THAT, HERE THEY COME.

37:11.746 --> 37:13.179
WHOO!

37:13.281 --> 37:16.582
ALL: YEAH!

37:16.685 --> 37:18.551
MAN: WHOO,
ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT!

37:18.653 --> 37:22.021
MAN: YEAH, WHOO!

37:22.123 --> 37:26.526
JESSIE HOLMES:
HAW, WHOA, HAW, HAW.

37:26.828 --> 37:27.727
MAN: WAY TO GO, JESSIE!

37:27.829 --> 37:30.229
YEAH, GOOD BOYS.

37:30.332 --> 37:34.467
JESSIE HOLMES:
I'M ABSOLUTELY, FLOORED.

37:35.870 --> 37:37.470
LET'S GO PRAISE THE DOGS.

37:37.572 --> 37:40.606
HEY BOYS, GOOD JOB.

37:40.809 --> 37:42.842
HEY, GUESS WHAT?

37:42.944 --> 37:45.878
YOU DID IT AGAIN,
YOU WON AGAIN.

37:45.981 --> 37:47.580
ARE YOU THE WINNERS?

37:47.682 --> 37:49.148
I HAD NO CHOICE
BUT TO START HARD,

37:49.250 --> 37:50.917
BECAUSE I COULDN'T SLOW
'EM DOWN DOWN THE HILLS.

37:51.019 --> 37:52.318
THINK WE WERE PROBABLY GOING
20 MILES AN HOUR SOME OF THOSE

37:52.420 --> 37:56.155
PLACES DOWN THE HILLS,
PASSING OTHER TEAMS.

37:56.257 --> 37:58.458
IN THE END, IT'S THE TRUST
OF THE DOGS THAT TOOK CARE

37:58.560 --> 38:01.094
OF ME, THEM TRUSTING ME.

38:01.196 --> 38:02.195
HEY, BOYS.

38:02.297 --> 38:03.196
I FEEL GREAT.

38:03.298 --> 38:04.464
I FEEL INVIGORATED.

38:04.566 --> 38:07.800
I GOT 16 DOGS THAT EXPERIENCE
A VICTORY IN WINNING,

38:07.902 --> 38:08.868
AND THAT'S GONNA
COUNT IN THE FUTURE.

38:08.970 --> 38:11.871
THESE DOGS KNOW THEY
WON, I KNOW THAT.

38:11.973 --> 38:14.640
THIS IS AN EXCEPTIONAL
DAY, NOT JUST A GOOD DAY.

38:14.743 --> 38:17.276
THIS IS WHAT I CALL
A GOOD DAY TO DIE.

38:17.379 --> 38:20.513
TO ME, RACING IS
EMOTIONAL, IT'S SPIRITUAL.

38:20.615 --> 38:23.149
BECAUSE I'M OUT THERE WITH MY
DOGS AND THEY ARE MY FAMILY.

38:23.251 --> 38:24.984
I FEEL LIKE I AM A
PART OF THE PACK.

38:25.086 --> 38:25.852
I'M THE COACH.

38:25.954 --> 38:27.086
THEY'RE THE ATHLETES.

38:27.188 --> 38:28.755
THEY'RE THE ONES WITH
THE DESIRE TO WORK HARD.

38:28.857 --> 38:31.524
THEY HAVE GREAT ATTITUDES,
ALASKAN HUSKIES.

38:31.626 --> 38:33.393
THEIR ATTITUDES HAVE
RUBBED OFF ON ME.

38:33.495 --> 38:35.528
I KNOW THESE DOGS ARE
CHAMPIONS AND THEN THEY GOT A

38:35.630 --> 38:38.664
CHANCE TO BE IN THE
WINNER'S CIRCLE.

38:39.334 --> 38:40.099
I'M DOING WHAT I LOVE.

38:40.235 --> 38:41.667
THE DOGS ARE DOING
WHAT THEY LOVE,

38:41.770 --> 38:43.202
AND IT JUST DOESN'T GET
ANY BETTER THAN THAT.

38:43.304 --> 38:45.271
AND IF I DIED TODAY,
I'D BE HAPPY WITH ALL THE

38:45.373 --> 38:49.242
WORK I PUT IN AND THE
DIRECTION I TOOK MY LIFE IN.

38:52.213 --> 38:53.613
GLENN VILLENEUVE: A LOT OF
PEOPLE THINK IT'S REALLY

38:53.715 --> 38:55.615
BOUNTIFUL BECAUSE
THEY'RE THINKING ALASKA,

38:55.717 --> 38:57.083
THE WILDERNESS.

38:57.185 --> 38:58.651
THERE MUST BE A BEAR BEHIND
EVERY BUSH AND A MOOSE AROUND

38:58.753 --> 39:00.219
EVERY CORNER, IT'S
NOT LIKE THAT.

39:00.321 --> 39:03.056
GOT TO WALK MILES TO
FIND ANIMALS OUT HERE.

39:11.800 --> 39:14.700
COLD NIGHT OUT IN THE WOODS.

39:17.372 --> 39:18.704
LITTLE SHELTER SERVED ME WELL.

39:18.807 --> 39:19.806
MADE IT THROUGH THE NIGHT.

39:19.908 --> 39:21.040
I GOT SOME GOOD REST.

39:21.142 --> 39:23.943
NOW IT'S TIME TO GO
CHECK MY BEAVER SNARES.

39:24.045 --> 39:26.079
IT'S JUST GETTING A LITTLE
LIGHT AND IT WON'T BE LONG

39:26.181 --> 39:27.713
BEFORE IT'S
GETTING DARK AGAIN.

39:27.816 --> 39:29.849
I GOTTA GO
CHECK THESE SNARES,

39:29.951 --> 39:31.884
THEN I'M GONNA
HEAD BACK TO MY CAMP.

39:31.986 --> 39:33.519
IF I'M LUCKY,
I'LL HAVE A BEAVER.

39:33.621 --> 39:37.890
HERE ARE MY BEAVER SNARES.

39:37.992 --> 39:39.725
DOWN HERE UNDER THE ICE.

39:39.828 --> 39:41.461
IT IS THE COLDEST, DARKEST
TIME OF THE YEAR AND IT'S A

39:41.563 --> 39:43.763
PARTICULARLY COLD DAY.

39:43.865 --> 39:45.965
IT'S 43 BELOW
ZERO RIGHT NOW.

39:46.067 --> 39:48.668
NOT THE IDEAL CONDITION
FOR CHECKING BEAVER SNARES,

39:48.770 --> 39:51.404
BUT OUT HERE, THAT'S
THE KIND OF THING YOU HAVE

39:51.506 --> 39:52.638
TO DEAL WITH.

39:52.740 --> 39:54.073
COLD WEATHER,
IF YOU DON'T LIKE IT,

39:54.175 --> 39:56.742
THIS ISN'T THE PLACE FOR YOU.

40:08.456 --> 40:11.958
IT'S TIME TO HAVE A
LOOK AT THESE SNARES.

40:12.760 --> 40:15.461
SEE IF I GOT A BEAVER.

40:15.563 --> 40:16.496
NOPE.

40:16.598 --> 40:18.764
NOTHING.

40:18.867 --> 40:21.400
NO, DIDN'T CATCH ANYTHING.

40:24.139 --> 40:26.973
THE BEAUTY OF SNARES IS THAT
THEY'LL KEEP WORKING FOR ME AS

40:27.075 --> 40:28.641
LONG AS I LEAVE THEM SET.

40:28.743 --> 40:31.244
I CAN LEAVE IT THERE
AS LONG AS I WANT TO.

40:31.346 --> 40:33.813
SO I'M GONNA PUT THESE
SNARES BACK DOWN,

40:33.915 --> 40:36.782
COVER IT BACK UP WITH SNOW,
AND THIS SNARE SET HERE WILL

40:36.885 --> 40:42.255
KEEP WORKING FOR ME.

40:45.894 --> 40:47.860
NOW I'LL BURY IT WITH SNOW
AND THE NEXT TIME I GO TO

40:47.962 --> 40:52.398
TAKE IT OUT, IT WON'T
BE BADLY FROZEN IN.

40:55.303 --> 40:56.269
THERE.

40:56.371 --> 40:57.670
GOT MY SNARES RESET.

40:57.772 --> 40:59.205
I GOT THE WHOLE
WINTER AHEAD OF ME.

40:59.307 --> 41:00.239
I DON'T HAVE TO RUSH.

41:00.375 --> 41:02.308
I CAN TAKE MY TIME, WAIT
FOR THE RIGHT MOMENT.

41:02.410 --> 41:03.709
SOONER OR LATER, THE RIGHT
ANIMAL WILL COME ALONG.

41:03.811 --> 41:06.779
UNTIL THAT TIME COMES,
I'M GONNA BE PATIENT AND

41:06.881 --> 41:09.682
ENJOY EVERY MINUTE OF IT.

41:11.019 --> 41:12.785
SUE AIKENS:
THIS IS MY BUCKET LIST.

41:12.887 --> 41:14.887
THIS IS WHAT I THRIVE.

41:14.989 --> 41:17.490
I DON'T WANNA DIE
WITHOUT KNOWING I ROSE

41:17.592 --> 41:20.059
TO THE CHALLENGE.

41:29.204 --> 41:31.938
FOR ME, THINGS ARE REALLY
GETTING KIND OF REAL.

41:32.040 --> 41:35.241
MY LITTLE PROPANE TANK
OFFICIALLY RAN OUT LAST NIGHT.

41:35.343 --> 41:37.877
NO HEAT, YOU GOT
THE WIND COMING IN.

41:37.979 --> 41:39.078
IT'S SUNNY RIGHT NOW.

41:39.180 --> 41:42.148
BUT I'VE GOT CLOUDS,
AND FOG IS COMING IN.

41:42.250 --> 41:45.117
I GOT SEVERAL INCHES
OF BRAND-NEW SNOW.

41:45.220 --> 41:47.019
I'VE USED THE SAT
PHONE TO CALL IN.

41:47.121 --> 41:49.889
I'VE GOT THE SMALLEST OF
WINDOWS TO TRY TO GET OUT,

41:49.991 --> 41:51.857
AND IF NOT, I'VE GOTTA HUNKER
DOWN FOR A WEEK OR MORE.

41:53.761 --> 41:56.095
I'M GONNA GO PUT MY CONES UP.

41:56.197 --> 41:58.531
THAT LETS THE PILOT
SAFELY KNOW WHERE THE RUNWAY

41:58.633 --> 42:00.566
IS UNDER THE SNOW.

42:00.668 --> 42:05.504
IT'S A WAY OF LETTING
THAT PILOT KNOW WHERE

42:05.607 --> 42:07.473
THE STANDARD STRIP IS.

42:07.575 --> 42:09.709
THIS IS THE BEAUTIFUL
DANGER OF NATURE.

42:10.612 --> 42:14.347
SO BEAUTIFUL, SO
PRISTINE, SO FRESH,

42:14.449 --> 42:16.649
WITH ALL THE BRAND-NEW SNOW.

42:16.751 --> 42:19.518
ALL THE BEAUTY IN THE
WORLD COMES WITH JUST THAT

42:19.621 --> 42:22.922
TOUCH OF CRUELTY.

42:24.859 --> 42:27.793
I'M JUST GONNA MAKE MYSELF
A PILE OF MY HEAVIER ITEMS

42:27.895 --> 42:30.062
BECAUSE WHEN
THAT PLANE LANDS,

42:30.164 --> 42:32.498
IT DEFINITELY IS
NOT GONNA GIVE ME

42:32.600 --> 42:36.736
A LOT OF
TIME FOR PACKING.

42:46.748 --> 42:52.385
¶ ¶

42:56.591 --> 42:58.491
MY TRIP HERE HAS BEEN A GOOD
ONE, BUT LIKE ALL ADVENTURES,

42:58.593 --> 43:01.694
SOONER OR LATER,
YOU GOT TO COME INTO PORT.

43:01.796 --> 43:06.899
SO I GOTTA GET BACK
TO THE PORT OF KAVIK AND

43:07.001 --> 43:08.234
SEE WHAT'S GOING ON THERE.

43:08.970 --> 43:11.504
GET READY FOR THE FINAL
COUNTDOWN TO WINTER.

43:11.606 --> 43:13.572
I GOT A LITTLE
BIT OF A REPRIEVE.

43:13.675 --> 43:15.841
HELL OF A GREAT TRIP.

43:15.943 --> 43:17.276
WAS I SUCCESSFUL HUNTING?

43:17.378 --> 43:18.778
NO.

43:18.880 --> 43:21.881
WAS I SUCCESSFUL IN
HAVING SUE TIME AND SEEING

43:21.983 --> 43:23.049
THINGS ONCE IN A LIFETIME?

43:23.151 --> 43:24.884
YUP.

43:24.986 --> 43:27.286
THIS IS IT, THE END OF
A REALLY GOOD JOURNEY.

43:27.388 --> 43:30.856
SOMETIMES, IT'S NOT ALL
ABOUT TAKING THE ANIMALS DOWN

43:30.958 --> 43:33.225
BUT ENJOYING THE
NATURE YOU'RE GIVEN.

43:33.328 --> 43:35.027
AND I CERTAINLY DID THAT.

43:35.129 --> 43:36.595
I GOT TO DANCE WITH WOLVES,

43:36.698 --> 43:38.631
<i>[HOWLING]</i>

43:38.733 --> 43:40.633
CATCH A FISH IN MY BARE HANDS.

43:40.735 --> 43:41.667
I GOT A FISH.

43:41.769 --> 43:45.104
I GOT REALLY
CLOSE TO THE SHEEP,

43:45.406 --> 43:48.274
FOUND OUT I AM ABLE TO SCURRY
UP AND DOWN THE SCREE FIELDS.

43:48.876 --> 43:51.344
SO, THAT'LL HELP ME PLAN
FOR THE NEXT ADVENTURE,

43:51.779 --> 43:54.980
BUT THIS JOURNEY
IS AT A CLOSE.

43:55.316 --> 43:59.285
SHEEP ONE, SUE ZERO, BUT I
THINK SUE HAD THE BETTER TRIP.

44:06.694 --> 44:09.395
ANDY BASSICH:
I LIKE EXPERIMENTING.

44:09.497 --> 44:10.496
I LIKE TRYING NEW THINGS.

44:10.598 --> 44:11.597
I LIKE DEVELOPING NEW SKILLS.

44:11.699 --> 44:14.600
AND I REALLY LIKE
BEING SELF-SUFFICIENT

44:14.702 --> 44:16.936
AND INDEPENDENT.

44:26.180 --> 44:28.647
¶ ¶

44:28.750 --> 44:30.583
SO I THINK IT'S PROBABLY
THE LAST DAY OF MUSKRAT

44:30.685 --> 44:31.784
TRAPPING OUT HERE.

44:31.886 --> 44:34.153
TEMPERATURES ARE ABOUT
TEN, FIFTEEN BELOW ZERO,

44:34.255 --> 44:36.489
AND IT'S GONNA BE HARD
TO KEEP THESE HOLES OPEN.

44:36.591 --> 44:39.925
HOPEFULLY, I GOT A LITTLE BIT
OF FUR IN ONE OF THESE HOLES.

44:40.027 --> 44:44.196
THESE HOLES FROZE
UP A LOT LAST NIGHT,

44:44.298 --> 44:46.766
WHICH GONNA MAKE IT HARD
TO KEEP THESE TRAPS WORKING.

44:49.737 --> 44:53.939
THIS FINGER'S REALLY
HURTING THOUGH TODAY.

44:56.978 --> 44:58.444
OH, I GOT A MUSKRAT.

44:58.546 --> 44:59.779
LOOK AT THAT.

44:59.881 --> 45:00.780
HE'S JUST A LITTLE GUY.

45:00.882 --> 45:03.983
SO ANDY ONE, RATS ZERO.

45:04.852 --> 45:07.086
WE JUST HAD THE SEVENTH
INNING STRETCH LAST NIGHT,

45:07.321 --> 45:10.423
NOW WE'RE IN THE
TOP OF THE SEVENTH.

45:10.525 --> 45:12.291
SEE IF WE GOT ANOTHER ONE.

45:12.393 --> 45:15.127
OH YEAH, TWO FOR TWO.

45:15.596 --> 45:17.530
YEE-HAW, I GOT FOOD.

45:18.399 --> 45:21.066
IN THIS CASE, ONE OF THE BIG
BENEFITS OF MUSKRAT TRAPPING

45:21.169 --> 45:23.903
IS GETTING SOME FUR TO MAKE
SOME MITTENS AND I'M A PERSON

45:24.005 --> 45:26.772
THAT JUST LOVES TO GET OUT AND
DO NEW THINGS AND EXPERIMENT

45:26.874 --> 45:29.341
AND I'M NOT GONNA LET A
LITTLE THING LIKE LOSING PART

45:29.444 --> 45:31.477
OF A PINKIE SLOW ME DOWN
FROM DOING THE KINDS OF THINGS

45:31.579 --> 45:35.581
I LOVE TO DO OUT HERE.

45:35.683 --> 45:38.417
LET'S SEE.

45:38.519 --> 45:43.022
OH YEAH, THREE FOR THREE,
GOT HIM WITH THE LEG-HOLD.

45:44.392 --> 45:45.891
YEAH, BUDDY.

45:45.993 --> 45:47.593
WE'RE AT THE BOTTOM
OF THE EIGHTH.

45:47.695 --> 45:49.895
IT'S ANDY THREE,
MUSKRATS ZIP.

45:49.997 --> 45:52.731
I GOT TWO MORE TO GO,
LET'S SEE WHAT HAPPENS.

45:57.805 --> 45:59.839
WELL, GOT BEAT ON ONE.

45:59.941 --> 46:03.042
SO NOW IT'S ANDY
THREE, MUSKRATS ONE.

46:03.311 --> 46:05.277
WE'RE AT THE BOTTOM
OF THE NINTH WITH

46:05.379 --> 46:06.679
ONE MORE HOLE TO GO.

46:06.781 --> 46:09.048
THERE'S TWO TRAPS IN
THIS ONE SO THEY COULD TIE

46:09.150 --> 46:11.851
IT UP RIGHT NOW.

46:14.489 --> 46:17.923
AND IT IS, A BUST.

46:20.361 --> 46:22.061
NOTHING IN THE LAST ONE.

46:22.163 --> 46:25.865
SO I'M FEELING LIKE THIS WAS
WORTH THE TIME AND THE EFFORT.

46:25.967 --> 46:28.667
NOT ONLY DID I CATCH SOME
MUSKRAT BUT I GOT THE PUPPIES

46:28.769 --> 46:29.668
OUT ON THE ICE AND
THEY'RE FEELING PRETTY

46:29.770 --> 46:31.704
COMFORTABLE WITH IT.

46:31.806 --> 46:34.907
PICKED UP SOME
FOOD FOR A NICE MUSKRAT STEW

46:35.009 --> 46:38.210
AND SOME FUR FOR SOME
MITTENS FOR MY DAMN FINGER.

46:38.513 --> 46:41.313
AND SO, ALL IN ALL,
I'M FEELING LIKE ALL THE TIME

46:41.415 --> 46:45.417
I SPENT OVER THE LAST DAY OR
TWO ON THIS IS TIME WELL SPENT.

46:46.320 --> 46:47.486
ALL RIGHT, BUDDY.

46:47.588 --> 46:48.621
COME ON, KRUG.

46:48.723 --> 46:49.855
ATTA-BOY.

46:49.957 --> 46:52.691
YEAH, YEAH, YEAH, GOOD BOY.
