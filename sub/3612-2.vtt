00:02.003 --> 00:04.119
Previously on Lost:

00:05.381 --> 00:06.496
Juliet?

00:08.342 --> 00:09.457
You did this.

00:11.429 --> 00:13.294
Kate! Hurley!

00:18.019 --> 00:21.136
Pick him up. Get him to the spring.
The water isn't clear. What happened?

00:24.192 --> 00:25.853
You're not saving him!
You're drowning him!

00:28.112 --> 00:30.524
- Your friend is dead.
- Jack!

00:35.620 --> 00:37.110
What happened?

00:58.100 --> 00:59.761
He's alive.

01:10.488 --> 01:14.401
It worked? Dude, you're OK!

01:14.492 --> 01:18.861
Hurley, let him breathe.
Miles, can you go get some water?

01:18.955 --> 01:20.911
Yeah, on it.

01:20.998 --> 01:23.159
Sayid. Hey.

01:23.709 --> 01:26.166
- How are you feeling?
- A little light-headed.

01:29.674 --> 01:31.164
Jack...

01:33.844 --> 01:35.835
What happened to me?

01:38.182 --> 01:39.513
You died.

01:43.271 --> 01:44.727
How is that even possible?

01:45.731 --> 01:49.223
I mean... One minute he's gone,
and now he's fine?

01:50.236 --> 01:52.568
- Of course he's fine.
- What does that mean?

01:52.655 --> 01:56.068
He's an Iraqi torturer who shoots kids.
He deserves another go-around.

02:05.710 --> 02:07.325
What are you looking at?

02:08.379 --> 02:10.586
How many guys with guns
are outside this place?

02:10.673 --> 02:11.788
What?

02:11.882 --> 02:13.964
l was out cold when they brought me in.

02:14.051 --> 02:16.303
How many guards did you see?
Five? Ten? A hundred?

02:16.387 --> 02:17.718
What are you thinking?

02:19.807 --> 02:21.513
I'm thinking about running, Kate.

02:24.729 --> 02:27.311
She's in handcuffs,
but probably got 'em covered, OK?

02:30.359 --> 02:31.394
Hey!

02:32.320 --> 02:33.730
Hey, watch it.

02:35.406 --> 02:38.443
- Go! Go now!
- Lady, I already have a customer.

02:38.534 --> 02:40.946
- Damn it, I said go!
- OK.

02:42.580 --> 02:44.286
Easy, easy. Slow down.

02:44.373 --> 02:46.580
- Just slow down. Slow down!
- OK! You said go!

02:46.667 --> 02:50.831
- Just get us out of here.
- Hey! Hey! Stop the cab!

02:50.921 --> 02:53.583
- Please, please just let me out of...
- Be quiet!

03:02.725 --> 03:04.636
- What are you doing? Move!
- There's a guy.

03:04.727 --> 03:06.263
I'm not gonna run him over.

03:06.604 --> 03:09.437
Hey. I'm walkin' here! I'm walkin' here!

03:20.618 --> 03:22.324
Do not get out of this car.

03:24.914 --> 03:27.781
Just go. Go now!
I don't care about the guy! Go!

03:30.044 --> 03:33.628
Hey! What the hell?!
I got your license plate!

03:37.301 --> 03:38.882
At the light, take a left.

03:41.764 --> 03:45.256
Can you please let me go? I promise
I won't say anything to anyone.

03:46.018 --> 03:47.519
Hey! Hey!

03:50.231 --> 03:51.516
Damn it!

03:52.358 --> 03:53.973
Please. Please.

03:59.323 --> 04:00.904
Give me your purse.

04:00.991 --> 04:03.152
- What?
- I said, give me your purse!

04:05.162 --> 04:07.904
- Now get out of the car.
- Can I just get my suitcase?

04:07.998 --> 04:09.704
No, you can't! Get out of the car!

04:21.971 --> 04:23.336
Easy.

04:24.432 --> 04:25.922
Right over there.

04:34.525 --> 04:36.766
Who are these people?

04:36.861 --> 04:39.728
- What do they want?
- It's the Others, dude.

04:39.822 --> 04:42.359
They caught us... again.

04:43.367 --> 04:46.359
I don't know. I think
they're trying to protect us.

04:46.454 --> 04:51.244
Yeah, and as you can see, Hugo here
has assumed the leadership position,

04:51.333 --> 04:52.914
so... that's pretty great.

04:54.295 --> 04:56.331
- What?
- The wound.

04:57.423 --> 04:59.630
It's almost completely closed.

05:10.060 --> 05:13.302
- Thank you, Jack.
- For what?

05:13.397 --> 05:14.807
Saving my life.

05:30.956 --> 05:32.947
Mr. Jarrah, will you
come with us, please?

05:33.042 --> 05:35.533
- Come with you where?
- Inside.

05:35.628 --> 05:38.165
- Nothing to worry about. We...
- I'm coming with him.

05:39.006 --> 05:41.918
Oh, I'm sorry.
We need to talk to him alone.

05:42.009 --> 05:45.172
- Just a few questions.
- You have a few questions? So do we.

05:45.262 --> 05:49.380
I mean, let's start with "Who are you?
Why are you holding us here?" You...

05:57.274 --> 06:00.937
Once we've spoken to Mr. Jarrah, we'll
tell you everything you want to know.

06:02.112 --> 06:05.775
Something tells me that you're not
gonna be happy to tell us anything.

06:22.132 --> 06:24.464
Don't shoot! Lower your weapons!

06:26.220 --> 06:28.006
Please, you don't have to do this.

06:28.973 --> 06:31.589
- We won't hurt your friend.
- He ain't my friend.

06:31.684 --> 06:34.391
You do what you want with him
and anybody else.

06:34.478 --> 06:37.311
But me? I'm walking outta here.

06:37.398 --> 06:40.310
- James?
- I'm gone. You understand?

06:42.069 --> 06:43.309
Please.

06:45.072 --> 06:46.812
You have to stay.

06:46.907 --> 06:48.818
No, I don't.

06:57.668 --> 06:59.499
Don't come after me.

07:25.738 --> 07:28.650
Hey! Hey!
Where are they taking Sayid?

07:28.741 --> 07:30.982
Hey, calm down! Everybody calm down!

07:32.202 --> 07:34.454
- Where'd Ford go?
- What?

07:34.538 --> 07:37.621
Ford. Your friend who just
ran out of here. Where did he go?

07:37.708 --> 07:39.744
- I don't know.
- You expect me to believe that?

07:39.835 --> 07:42.451
He told me he wanted to kill me.
You believe that?

07:42.546 --> 07:45.253
- I can bring him back.
- You know where he went?

07:45.341 --> 07:47.127
No, but I can track him.

07:48.177 --> 07:52.170
Let me go. I will bring him back,
and I can make him stay.

07:52.264 --> 07:55.973
Kate... You sure you wanna go
out there alone with these people?

07:56.060 --> 07:57.095
I'll go with her.

08:01.065 --> 08:04.307
It's very important
that he gets back here safely.

08:04.401 --> 08:06.813
What makes you think
he's gonna listen to you?

08:06.904 --> 08:09.896
I can very convincing when I wanna be.

08:24.129 --> 08:25.460
Where's your tire hammer?

08:31.387 --> 08:33.594
- You got a problem.
- So do you.

08:33.681 --> 08:37.424
- Where's your tire hammer?
- Tire hammer'll cut off your wrists.

08:37.518 --> 08:40.510
Your problem is you need a punch press,
and you're not gonna be able

08:40.604 --> 08:42.936
to use one of those
and keep that gun pointed at me.

08:44.108 --> 08:46.224
- You volunteering?
- I got steady hands,

08:46.318 --> 08:48.855
but I kinda feel like
we got off on the wrong foot.

08:51.532 --> 08:53.193
I'll give you $200.

08:57.454 --> 08:58.705
Now hold still.

09:09.717 --> 09:11.207
Thanks.

09:11.301 --> 09:15.135
- So why the bracelets?
- l'm wanted for murder.

09:17.015 --> 09:18.004
Murder?

09:18.100 --> 09:19.965
You don't have somewhere
I could change?

09:22.146 --> 09:23.886
Bathroom's over there.

09:23.981 --> 09:26.142
- Make it quick.
- Thank you.

10:26.210 --> 10:27.871
You better not slow us down.

10:29.755 --> 10:31.461
You better not slow me down.

10:36.887 --> 10:40.550
- I'd go with you, but...
- But Sawyer would kill you?

10:46.563 --> 10:49.851
I'll take care of James.
You take care of Sayid.

10:52.569 --> 10:53.854
Deal.

10:59.952 --> 11:01.112
Goodbye.

11:05.999 --> 11:07.500
Be careful.

11:28.939 --> 11:30.725
What is it you want?

11:33.694 --> 11:36.231
Please, whatever
you're thinking of doing...

11:44.288 --> 11:45.778
What is that?

12:02.931 --> 12:04.307
Just tell me what you want.

12:34.087 --> 12:37.921
Why?! Why are you doing this?

12:52.189 --> 12:53.895
I don't have any secrets.

12:55.692 --> 12:57.023
Ask...

13:17.339 --> 13:20.422
I'm sorry we had to put you
through that. It was a test.

13:20.509 --> 13:23.342
- We had to be sure.
- Test to be sure of what?

13:23.887 --> 13:25.047
Don't worry.

13:25.931 --> 13:27.421
You passed.

13:41.405 --> 13:43.487
| just lied to him, didn't I?

13:45.283 --> 13:46.568
Yes.

14:03.051 --> 14:05.428
- Where were you going?
- What?

14:06.138 --> 14:08.174
Before I got in the cab,
where were you going?

14:08.265 --> 14:10.426
Why, so you can hijack them, too?

14:12.811 --> 14:16.303
- l was waiting for a bus.
- I came to bring you your stuff.

14:18.108 --> 14:22.226
- Relax. I didn't take your money.
- Well, gee, thanks.

14:23.780 --> 14:26.772
- So where were you goin'?
- Don't worry about it.

14:30.495 --> 14:31.996
Fine.

14:34.791 --> 14:37.749
Langdon Street. Brentwood.

14:41.131 --> 14:43.713
- You got family there?
- No.

14:43.800 --> 14:46.837
It's the... couple
who's adopting my baby.

14:48.972 --> 14:51.088
They were meant
to meet me at the airport,

14:51.183 --> 14:54.175
but I guess they got
the days mixed up or somethin'.

14:54.269 --> 14:57.136
- It's not like they abandoned me.
- Brentwood's not far. Get in.

14:57.230 --> 14:58.345
Seriously?

14:59.983 --> 15:01.484
Do you want a ride or not?

15:13.622 --> 15:15.908
So why do you people
want us to stay at the Temple?

15:15.999 --> 15:18.456
- We're protecting you.
- From what?

15:18.543 --> 15:20.579
You've been on this island
a while, right?

15:20.670 --> 15:24.413
Ever see a pillar of black smoke, makes
a "ticka ticka" sound, looks pissed off?

15:24.508 --> 15:27.375
- Yes.
- From that.

15:28.345 --> 15:31.508
Do you know anything about another
plane coming in? An Ajira flight.

15:31.598 --> 15:33.509
I'm sorry. Is this a press conference?

15:34.851 --> 15:38.309
- Think he means the one that landed...
- Justin. Shut up.

15:45.237 --> 15:47.228
No, that's a decoy trail.
He went this way.

15:47.322 --> 15:50.405
- And you're basing this on what?
- Experience.

15:51.701 --> 15:53.441
- Aldo.
- What?

15:53.537 --> 15:57.121
- I think she's right.
- Of course she is.

15:57.874 --> 15:59.660
After you, princess.

16:00.710 --> 16:04.123
What's your strategy for bringing
your boyfriend back? I hope you got one.

16:04.214 --> 16:06.876
He shot a guy on his way out.
If he tries that on me,

16:06.967 --> 16:08.628
- I'm gonna blow his head off.
- Watch it.

16:11.471 --> 16:15.089
- Thank you.
- Looks like one of Rousseau's traps.

16:15.183 --> 16:18.550
The Frenchwoman? She's been dead
for years. This couldn't be one...

16:18.645 --> 16:21.432
Justin! Shut up.

16:25.485 --> 16:27.396
What was he gonna say?

16:28.321 --> 16:32.234
You don't even remember me, do you?
You don't recognize me?

16:34.411 --> 16:37.027
Well, maybe this will jog your memory.
Three years ago,

16:37.122 --> 16:40.410
you staged yourself
a little prison break,

16:40.500 --> 16:44.038
by knocking the guard out with the
butt of your rifle. That would be me.

16:54.181 --> 16:55.296
What are you doing?

16:59.060 --> 17:00.766
Escaping.

17:07.402 --> 17:08.903
Sayid!

17:11.156 --> 17:13.772
- You OK, man?
- Jack! He's back!

17:20.207 --> 17:22.493
Sayid, what happened?

17:22.584 --> 17:24.700
- They tortured me.
- Why?

17:24.794 --> 17:28.753
Don't know. They didn't
ask me any questions.

17:37.641 --> 17:39.006
Step aside.

17:55.951 --> 17:57.407
Hey, Shephard.

17:58.662 --> 18:02.120
- We were hoping you'd come on your own.
- What the hell did you do to Sayid?

18:03.625 --> 18:05.581
We didn't do anything to him.

18:05.669 --> 18:08.331
- Your friend is sick.
- Sick with what?

18:11.466 --> 18:15.084
He's... Yeah, I... There's not really...

18:15.178 --> 18:17.043
There's not really
a literal translation.

18:17.138 --> 18:18.548
The closest thing would be...

18:19.766 --> 18:21.757
- ...infected.
- Infected?

18:21.851 --> 18:23.591
He's not even runnin' a fever.

18:27.315 --> 18:28.771
Did I say something funny?

18:28.858 --> 18:31.850
I doubt it. He doesn't
really have a sense of humor.

18:44.874 --> 18:47.081
He says you have to
give your friend this pill.

18:49.796 --> 18:51.457
Are you serious?

18:53.800 --> 18:55.256
Why don't you give it to him?

18:56.386 --> 18:58.468
It won't work unless
he takes it willingly,

18:58.555 --> 19:00.420
and he won't take it willingly from us.

19:00.515 --> 19:03.052
You should've asked him to take it
before you tortured him.

19:03.143 --> 19:04.883
We didn't torture him.

19:05.895 --> 19:09.479
- We were diagnosing him.
- To see if he was infected.

19:09.566 --> 19:10.772
Yes.

19:11.985 --> 19:14.818
I'm not gonna give anything to Sayid
unless I know what's in it.

19:17.907 --> 19:19.192
Tell me, Shephard...

19:21.161 --> 19:22.196
...your friend...

19:24.205 --> 19:25.536
...how did he get shot?

19:27.709 --> 19:29.370
He was...

19:31.546 --> 19:35.835
- He was helping me.
- So it was your fault?

19:35.925 --> 19:40.009
- Yes.
- And there have been others

19:40.096 --> 19:42.257
who were hurt or died...

19:42.849 --> 19:44.589
...helping you?

19:46.144 --> 19:47.680
Yes.

19:49.856 --> 19:51.357
Well...

19:52.484 --> 19:55.976
...then this is your chance
to redeem yourself.

20:03.620 --> 20:07.533
It's medicine,
and your friend needs it.

20:09.125 --> 20:11.707
What happens if! don't give it to him?

20:16.466 --> 20:19.299
The infection will spread.

20:27.811 --> 20:30.678
So... nothing?
There wasn't anything?

20:30.772 --> 20:35.186
No white light? Angels singing?
No dead relatives?

20:35.276 --> 20:37.653
I remember being shot.

20:38.905 --> 20:40.645
You're not a zombie, right?

20:42.659 --> 20:46.493
No. I am not a zombie.

20:47.497 --> 20:48.987
Hey.

20:52.836 --> 20:55.043
You mind giving me and Sayid a minute?

20:55.130 --> 20:57.246
Yeah, see, private talks
kinda freak me out,

20:57.340 --> 21:01.583
'cause they usually lead to me having to
do something I don't quite understand.

21:01.678 --> 21:04.841
- I'm right there with ya.
- It's fine.

21:04.931 --> 21:07.172
We'll be in the food court
if you need us.

21:17.944 --> 21:21.027
So did they tell you why
they burnt me with a hot poker?

21:23.408 --> 21:25.694
They said they were trying
to diagnose you.

21:25.785 --> 21:27.366
Right.

21:28.371 --> 21:33.582
They told me it was some sort of test,
which they said I passed.

21:35.503 --> 21:36.538
Clearly, I didn't.

21:43.511 --> 21:44.842
What's that?

21:46.973 --> 21:48.679
They want you to take it.

21:49.267 --> 21:52.430
- It's medicine, according to them.
- What about according to you?

21:53.480 --> 21:55.016
I don't know.

21:58.359 --> 22:00.350
And, you know, before, when you...

22:00.653 --> 22:03.269
...when you thanked me
for saving your life, I...

22:05.700 --> 22:07.736
I didn't have anything
to do with it, Sayid.

22:09.245 --> 22:11.281
I didn't fix you. They did.

22:16.711 --> 22:18.576
I don't care who fixed me.

22:19.756 --> 22:24.341
I only care about who I trust, so if
you want me to take that pill, Jack...

22:26.346 --> 22:28.007
...|'|| do it.

22:38.525 --> 22:41.733
- Wait. Where are you going?
- Catching up with Sawyer.

22:42.445 --> 22:44.811
You never planned
to bring him back to the Temple.

22:44.906 --> 22:46.988
No. I'm not interested
in being a prisoner.

22:47.075 --> 22:49.782
- Where did your plane land, Kate?
- What?

22:49.869 --> 22:52.451
The Ajira plane that you,
Jack and Hurley came in on...

22:52.539 --> 22:55.030
- Where did it land?
- I don't know.

22:55.124 --> 22:58.457
Sun was on that plane, too,
and I have to find her.

22:58.545 --> 23:00.035
You think they're gonna tell you?

23:00.129 --> 23:03.496
You think they care about you
or about Sun or about any of us?

23:06.636 --> 23:08.297
Who do you care about, Kate?

23:10.223 --> 23:11.713
Good luck, Jin.

23:12.308 --> 23:14.799
Once you catch up with Sawyer...
then what?

23:17.272 --> 23:19.137
I guess we'll figure that out together.

23:26.322 --> 23:29.735
So... What happened
to your handcuffs?

23:29.826 --> 23:31.657
I cut them off.

23:36.457 --> 23:38.163
It's a beautiful neighborhood.

23:39.836 --> 23:42.168
I bet they're a really nice couple.

23:48.177 --> 23:51.510
- What?
- I didn't say anything.

23:51.598 --> 23:54.931
What, you think they didn't
come to the airport on purpose?

23:56.019 --> 23:57.725
Why would I think that?

23:58.771 --> 24:01.183
Good, 'cause they didn't.

24:05.153 --> 24:06.643
This is it.

24:20.585 --> 24:21.995
Will you come in with me?

24:24.047 --> 24:25.787
Are you kidding me?

24:25.882 --> 24:29.249
Please, ljust... I really
don't want to go up there on my own.

24:40.605 --> 24:44.314
Hi. Mrs. Baskum?
I'm Claire Littleton.

24:46.444 --> 24:47.980
Oh, my God.

24:49.280 --> 24:50.986
I'm so sorry.

24:53.910 --> 24:55.946
My husband...

25:00.917 --> 25:02.828
...he left me.

25:02.919 --> 25:08.710
And... believe me,
I wanted a baby so much,

25:08.800 --> 25:12.713
but... I can't do it alone.

25:13.429 --> 25:14.680
I'm sorry.

25:16.182 --> 25:19.049
Look, I know I should've called you...

25:19.143 --> 25:21.976
So, you just changed your mind?

25:22.063 --> 25:26.477
Look... Look, my life isjust...
a little bit complicated right now.

25:26.567 --> 25:29.309
She came all the way from Australia,
and you don't call?

25:29.404 --> 25:30.610
Oh, my God.

25:34.033 --> 25:37.275
- Are you OK?
- It's coming!

27:23.267 --> 27:24.768
Who's there?

27:26.354 --> 27:29.812
You better come out now or so help me,
I'm just gonna start shootin'.

27:34.946 --> 27:37.107
What the hell are you doin' here?

27:39.200 --> 27:41.282
I was worried about you.

28:13.067 --> 28:14.568
What's happening?

28:14.902 --> 28:17.814
- I think I'm having contractions.
- When did they start?

28:17.905 --> 28:20.317
- About 20 minutes ago.
- Try to relax.

28:20.408 --> 28:23.320
We're gonna take you to
the MCU to get looked at.

28:23.411 --> 28:24.696
Are you with her?

28:25.413 --> 28:27.495
- Yeah.
- OK, follow me.

28:28.583 --> 28:30.164
What are you doing? What's going on?

28:30.251 --> 28:32.663
Hold on. The doctor will
be with you in just a moment.

28:33.296 --> 28:37.005
What's going on?
Is something wrong?

28:37.717 --> 28:40.299
Excuse me. Excuse me.

28:40.386 --> 28:42.047
- Yes.
- Are you a doctor?

28:42.138 --> 28:44.880
- Yes. I'm Dr. Goodspeed.
- Can I please get your help in here?

28:49.020 --> 28:52.512
Ms. Littleton?
Claire, how are you feeling?

28:52.607 --> 28:55.895
Uncomfortable. What's happening?

28:55.985 --> 29:00.399
What's happening is that Mother Nature's
gotten a little ahead of herself.

29:01.282 --> 29:02.567
You ready to have your baby?

29:03.618 --> 29:06.234
- I'm sorry. What?!
- You're at 36 weeks.

29:06.329 --> 29:09.196
Three centimeters dilated
and about 80 percent effaced.

29:09.290 --> 29:12.123
Which means, if you want,
you can have your baby tonight.

29:12.209 --> 29:15.201
If I want? So what, you mean...
You mean you can stop it, then?

29:15.296 --> 29:18.083
Maybe. However, to do that
would require a number of drugs.

29:18.174 --> 29:20.506
Drugs? I mean, will that hurt the baby?

29:20.593 --> 29:22.174
No, they're perfectly safe.

29:22.261 --> 29:26.470
I don't want to stick you with needles
ifl don't have to. So it's up to you.

29:36.817 --> 29:39.069
- I'm not ready.
- OK.

29:39.820 --> 29:42.072
Let's get her started
on the nifedipine drip.

29:44.116 --> 29:46.573
- What is it?
- Margaret, let's do an ultrasound.

29:47.662 --> 29:49.948
I wanna get a picture
of what's going on in there.

29:50.039 --> 29:52.325
It could just mean
the baby's out of position.

29:52.416 --> 29:56.534
What are you... What are you saying?!
What's happening to my baby?!

29:56.629 --> 30:00.542
Is my baby OK?! ls Aaron OK?!

30:02.551 --> 30:03.882
See?

30:04.887 --> 30:10.553
There he is. Everything is just fine.
Your boy just likes to move around.

30:12.979 --> 30:16.312
One hundred and forty BPM.
Perfectly normal.

30:17.358 --> 30:21.897
I have a feeling that Aaron
is gonna be a handful.

30:23.864 --> 30:25.604
Now let's see if we can slow this down.

30:28.244 --> 30:29.484
You did great, Mommy.

30:31.080 --> 30:32.911
Thanks.

31:00.526 --> 31:05.441
A couple days ago, you asked me
why I came back to the island.

31:10.453 --> 31:11.863
I need to find Claire.

31:13.289 --> 31:18.875
I thought, maybe, if! could
catch up to you, you could help me,

31:18.961 --> 31:20.872
and then...

31:21.630 --> 31:24.337
...maybe if we could find her
and bring her back to Aaron,

31:24.425 --> 31:26.962
then maybe all of this
wouldn't have been for nothing.

31:30.973 --> 31:34.932
I'm sorry. I never
should've followed you.

31:36.979 --> 31:38.685
Which time?

31:46.072 --> 31:48.905
That was your house, right? With Juliet.

31:50.159 --> 31:51.649
Yep.

31:53.662 --> 31:55.118
I'm sorry.

31:55.206 --> 31:57.322
- You already said that.
- No...

31:59.376 --> 32:01.207
...for Juliet.

32:03.089 --> 32:04.954
If I hadn't come after you on the sub,

32:05.049 --> 32:08.212
then you two would've left,
and she would've never died.

32:08.302 --> 32:10.258
It's not your fault she's dead.

32:14.600 --> 32:16.261
It's mine.

32:18.395 --> 32:22.855
She was sittin' right there,
right where you are now,

32:22.942 --> 32:25.433
tryin' to leave this place.

32:26.529 --> 32:28.986
And I convinced her to stay.

32:33.702 --> 32:37.866
I made her stay on this island
'cause I didn't want to be alone.

32:42.211 --> 32:44.577
You understand that, right?

32:51.387 --> 32:52.877
But...

32:55.391 --> 32:59.384
But I think some of us
are meant to be alone.

33:07.194 --> 33:09.401
I was gonna ask her to marry me.

33:35.764 --> 33:38.676
You can probably make it back
to the Temple by nightfall.

34:14.011 --> 34:17.003
- What's that?
- It's a baseball.

34:26.815 --> 34:29.306
You speak pretty good English
for someone who needs a translator.

34:31.028 --> 34:33.940
We both know that
I don't need a translator.

34:34.031 --> 34:35.441
Then why do you have one?

34:36.492 --> 34:41.657
Because I have to remain separate
from the people I'm in charge of.

34:43.165 --> 34:47.875
It makes it easier when they don't like
the decisions I make for them.

34:50.798 --> 34:52.004
Who are you?

34:53.759 --> 34:57.502
- My name is Dogen.
- Are you from here, the island?

34:58.597 --> 35:03.341
- I was brought here like everyone else.
- What do you mean, "brought here?"

35:07.231 --> 35:09.222
You know exactly what I mean.

35:13.153 --> 35:15.860
You didn't give your friend
the pill, did you?

35:16.991 --> 35:21.325
- No.
- Why not?

35:21.412 --> 35:23.243
Because I don't know what's in it.

35:24.873 --> 35:27.410
- Itwill eliminate...
- The infection, yeah.

35:27.501 --> 35:29.207
I got that.

35:30.004 --> 35:31.915
- But what's in it?
- I cannot explain.

35:32.006 --> 35:34.338
- Try.
- There isn't any time.

35:34.425 --> 35:36.916
- He'll die if you don't...
- He already died.

35:39.763 --> 35:41.879
What is in it?

35:45.894 --> 35:48.101
You just have to trust me.

35:50.524 --> 35:52.810
I don't trust myself.

35:52.901 --> 35:54.437
How am I supposed to trust you?

36:02.077 --> 36:03.817
Let's see where trust gets us.

36:18.177 --> 36:22.591
Now... are you gonna tell me
what's in it?

36:29.605 --> 36:30.970
Poison.

36:40.532 --> 36:41.817
Come in.

36:44.203 --> 36:47.536
- Excuse me. Ms. Littleton?
- Yeah?

36:47.623 --> 36:49.579
I'm Detective Rasmussen.

36:50.417 --> 36:53.534
- ls Ms. Hart here?
- I'm sorry. Who?

36:53.629 --> 36:59.169
- Joan Hart. She signed in with you.
- She was just the cab driver.

36:59.259 --> 37:01.295
I needed help,
and she brought me up here.

37:01.387 --> 37:03.969
She left after they treated me, though.

37:04.056 --> 37:06.968
Did she give you any indication
where she was headed?

37:07.059 --> 37:09.550
- Why? Is something wrong?
- No.

37:09.645 --> 37:13.433
It's nothing for you to worry about.
Come on. Let's go.

37:25.994 --> 37:28.155
- Thanks.
- Sure.

37:32.251 --> 37:33.866
Thank you.

37:36.672 --> 37:40.005
Why are they after you?
What did you do?

37:41.218 --> 37:43.880
Would you believe me
if! said I was innocent?

37:46.849 --> 37:48.760
Yeah. Yeah, I would.

37:55.190 --> 37:56.691
Well, I should go.

37:57.776 --> 37:59.357
Oh, wait.

38:00.404 --> 38:02.986
- Here. Take my credit card.
- No.

38:03.073 --> 38:06.281
There's not much of a limit on it,
but it's something.

38:06.368 --> 38:07.699
You don't have to do this.

38:07.786 --> 38:09.947
You didn't have to do
what you did either.

38:18.338 --> 38:19.919
Aaron's a great name.

38:20.007 --> 38:22.589
I don't know why I said it. It's like...

38:22.676 --> 38:24.883
I don't know. I knew it or something.

38:27.097 --> 38:29.258
I think you should keep him.

38:31.977 --> 38:37.563
- Well, good luck.
- Yeah. You, too.

38:38.901 --> 38:40.061
Thanks.

39:31.995 --> 39:33.110
He swallowed it?

39:35.582 --> 39:36.742
Yes.

39:44.841 --> 39:47.127
- What's this?
- Tea.

40:03.652 --> 40:06.143
Why would you people want to kill Sayid?

40:11.326 --> 40:13.408
We believe he has been...

40:19.251 --> 40:23.836
- Closest translation is "claimed."
- Claimed.

40:27.009 --> 40:27.998
By what?

40:31.179 --> 40:33.670
There is a darkness growing in him.

40:34.683 --> 40:37.095
And once it reaches his heart...

40:38.312 --> 40:40.553
...everything your friend once was...

40:42.024 --> 40:43.685
...will be gone.

40:45.360 --> 40:46.645
No, I don't...

40:47.988 --> 40:49.979
How can you be sure of that?

40:55.370 --> 40:57.861
Because it happened to your sister.

41:23.398 --> 41:24.649
Get up!

41:26.360 --> 41:27.566
That's for my head.

41:28.737 --> 41:30.648
Now... Where's that bitch?

41:30.739 --> 41:33.981
I don't know.
You don't understand.

41:34.076 --> 41:36.158
- I'm going back to the Temple!
- Yeah, right.

41:36.244 --> 41:39.077
It looks like he's alone.
Maybe we should take him back.

41:39.164 --> 41:41.496
Or maybe we didn't find him alive.

41:41.583 --> 41:43.915
Aldo, no. We can't. He's one of them.

41:44.002 --> 41:45.458
He may be one of them.

41:45.545 --> 41:47.410
Hey! Hey!

41:55.138 --> 41:56.514
Where you goin'?

42:11.822 --> 42:13.028
Claire?
