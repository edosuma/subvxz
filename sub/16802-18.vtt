WEBVTT

00:03.003 --> 00:04.713
Georgie: Previously
on "Heartland".

00:04.754 --> 00:06.589
- One of our major investors
just pulled out

00:06.631 --> 00:07.716
at the last minute.

00:07.757 --> 00:09.467
- So when is the big day?

00:09.509 --> 00:10.677
- Well, we can't do it
without Ty,

00:10.719 --> 00:12.387
so as soon as he's back,
it's happening.

00:12.429 --> 00:13.847
- Ready to go? Hey.
- Hey.

00:13.888 --> 00:15.849
- Peter and I are going
for dinner

00:15.890 --> 00:18.643
with an investor friend of his.
- Uh, cross my fingers for you.

00:18.685 --> 00:20.478
For both of you.

00:20.520 --> 00:23.523
- There is a reason
that Peter is your ex.

00:23.565 --> 00:26.484
Please don't go into business
with him.

00:26.526 --> 00:28.445
- I got your test back
from the lab,

00:28.486 --> 00:29.738
and it looks like
the antibiotics

00:29.779 --> 00:32.031
are starting to work.

00:32.073 --> 00:34.242
Then I don't see why you won't
make a full recovery.

00:34.284 --> 00:36.411
(Relieved sighs)

00:39.706 --> 00:41.583
(Hooves thunder)

00:42.834 --> 00:55.513
**

00:55.555 --> 00:56.514
- Come on.

00:56.556 --> 00:57.766
(Clicks tongue)

00:57.807 --> 01:00.268
Let's go.
Good boys. Come on.

01:01.728 --> 01:04.355
There you go.

01:04.397 --> 01:07.025
Amy: Hey, Georgie,
do you need a hand?

01:07.067 --> 01:10.278
- You need to relax.
- I am relaxed.

01:10.320 --> 01:12.572
- No, you're not.
- Okay, fine.

01:12.614 --> 01:14.991
I'm not going to until Ty
gets out of the hospital.

01:15.033 --> 01:17.577
- When's he getting home?
- Soon. I hope.

01:17.619 --> 01:19.037
Maybe today?

01:19.079 --> 01:20.872
It'll be great.
He's going stir crazy.

01:20.914 --> 01:22.415
- So are you.

01:22.457 --> 01:24.793
(Horses whinny)
- Yeah.

01:24.834 --> 01:26.169
What's got into them?

01:26.211 --> 01:27.712
- Who knows.

01:27.754 --> 01:29.464
(Horses whinny)

01:31.591 --> 01:33.927
Hey, Georgie.

01:33.968 --> 01:35.512
There he is.

01:35.553 --> 01:37.806
That is Ghost. The horse
I was telling you about.

01:37.847 --> 01:40.725
- The one who got caught
in a fence?

01:40.767 --> 01:42.811
- Yeah.

01:42.852 --> 01:46.981
**

01:47.023 --> 01:49.818
- He's beautiful.

01:49.859 --> 01:52.946
Maybe I can see if his cuts
are all healed up?

01:52.987 --> 01:55.699
- No, it's okay.
- Yeah, I'll try to get closer.

01:55.740 --> 02:05.750
**

02:05.750 --> 02:11.589
**

02:11.631 --> 02:12.799
Easy.

02:14.259 --> 02:15.677
(Snorts)

02:18.471 --> 02:19.597
(Slow exhale)

02:22.392 --> 02:24.686
(Whinnies)

02:24.728 --> 02:27.022
(Snorts)

02:27.063 --> 02:28.898
(Crow caws)

02:28.940 --> 02:32.819
**

02:32.861 --> 02:34.654
Sorry, I shouldn't have
gotten so close,

02:34.696 --> 02:37.407
but his cuts look healed up.

02:37.449 --> 02:39.993
- That's good. At least we know
he's all right.

02:40.035 --> 02:41.453
- You okay?

02:41.494 --> 02:43.079
- Yeah. Yeah.

02:43.121 --> 02:45.123
It's just, I don't know what
it is about that horse,

02:45.165 --> 02:48.084
but every time I see him
something bad happens.

02:48.126 --> 02:50.879
Like, Ty getting sick.

02:50.920 --> 02:53.089
(Shivers) It's freezing.

02:53.131 --> 02:54.841
Let's get these horses inside.

02:54.883 --> 02:57.385
- You need a bigger coat.
A much bigger coat.

02:57.427 --> 02:58.970
Amy: Very funny.

02:59.012 --> 03:00.847
(Georgie giggles)

03:02.974 --> 03:04.434
Caleb: Hey!

03:04.476 --> 03:05.810
What do you think you're doing,
Amy?

03:05.852 --> 03:07.062
You shouldn't be messing
around with the horses.

03:07.103 --> 03:10.148
Not this late in the game.
- And that's what I told her.

03:10.190 --> 03:12.108
- Why don't you go inside,
put your feet up.

03:12.150 --> 03:14.861
Do whatever pregnant ladies do.
- Thanks, Caleb.

03:14.903 --> 03:16.863
You know, a few days ago,

03:16.905 --> 03:18.990
I had no problem bringing
the horses in by myself.

03:19.032 --> 03:21.576
But, I don't know, the baby
must have dropped or something.

03:21.618 --> 03:23.244
It's getting harder to walk.

03:23.286 --> 03:25.330
- Yeah, way too much
information for a cowboy.

03:25.372 --> 03:26.790
- Sorry.

03:26.831 --> 03:28.667
(Groans) So...

03:28.708 --> 03:30.669
How are the wedding plans going?

03:30.710 --> 03:33.254
- Good. I mean, you know Cass,

03:33.296 --> 03:35.882
she's crazy nervous about every
last little detail, but--

03:35.924 --> 03:37.634
Tim: She should be nervous.

03:37.676 --> 03:40.011
She should be terrified.

03:40.053 --> 03:43.014
So, Amy,
doctor's appointment today.

03:43.056 --> 03:45.058
I can drive you into town, but
we gonna have to leave early.

03:45.100 --> 03:46.726
- I don't know
if that's gonna work.

03:46.768 --> 03:48.603
I wanted to visit Ty.
- I can give you a ride.

03:48.645 --> 03:49.979
We can visit Ty together.

03:50.021 --> 03:52.023
- Well, if you two can do that
that would be very helpful.

03:52.065 --> 03:53.692
- Okay, great.
I'll be ready in a few minutes.

03:53.733 --> 03:55.610
- Cool.

03:55.652 --> 03:57.237
- So...

03:57.278 --> 03:59.364
you're really gonna go through
with this marriage, huh?

03:59.406 --> 04:00.865
- Yeah. (laughs)

04:00.907 --> 04:02.617
It's only a couple days away.

04:02.659 --> 04:04.619
Cass' parents get into town
tomorrow.

04:04.661 --> 04:07.038
- I can only imagine what's
going through their heads?

04:07.080 --> 04:10.667
Their college educated
veterinarian daughter,

04:10.709 --> 04:14.462
marrying an unemployed,
divorced rodeo cowboy.

04:14.504 --> 04:18.048
- Actually,
I gotta ask you something.

04:18.091 --> 04:20.885
Can I have a job? Full-time job
at your rodeo school?

04:20.927 --> 04:26.558
**

04:26.599 --> 04:27.851
Georgie: (Exhales)

04:27.892 --> 04:29.686
Guess what Amy and I just saw?

04:29.728 --> 04:30.937
That horse Cass fixed up, Ghost.

04:30.979 --> 04:32.939
- No kidding. How's he look?

04:32.981 --> 04:34.232
- Good. His cuts are all
healed up.

04:34.274 --> 04:35.984
- Well, it's good to hear that.

04:36.026 --> 04:37.986
- Yeah, but I kinda feel bad
for him.

04:38.028 --> 04:40.071
All alone. No one to take
care of him.

04:40.113 --> 04:42.157
- Ghost has looked after
himself pretty well

04:42.198 --> 04:43.783
over the years.

04:43.825 --> 04:44.993
- Yeah, but he got himself
caught up

04:45.035 --> 04:47.871
in that barbed wire fence.

04:47.912 --> 04:51.666
Do you think a wild horse
could ever actually be broke?

04:51.708 --> 04:53.752
- Well, it can be done
for sure, but it aint' easy.

04:53.793 --> 04:55.670
Amy tried with Ghost.

04:55.712 --> 04:57.630
- Really? Amy tried to gentle
him?

04:57.672 --> 05:00.592
- Yeah. Boy,
that was a long time ago.

05:00.633 --> 05:02.761
And it wasn't a good experience.

05:02.802 --> 05:06.181
You know, sometimes they
just wanna be wild.

05:06.222 --> 05:08.058
- Yeah, I don't get that
feeling with Ghost.

05:08.099 --> 05:12.604
I feel like he wants
or almost needs to be here.

05:12.645 --> 05:16.024
I know Amy tried,
but maybe I can gentle him.

05:18.777 --> 05:20.528
Can you help me?

05:20.570 --> 05:22.697
- (Sighs)

05:22.739 --> 05:24.783
- So how'd your appointment go?

05:24.824 --> 05:26.534
- Well, the doctor said
I'm ready to have this baby

05:26.576 --> 05:28.161
at any moment.

05:28.203 --> 05:30.121
I told her I'm waiting 'til Ty
gets out of the hospital.

05:30.163 --> 05:31.790
And her words?
"Good luck with that."

05:31.831 --> 05:33.208
- Well, he's gotta get
out of the hospital.

05:33.249 --> 05:35.085
I'm not getting married
without my best man.

05:35.126 --> 05:37.295
- Caleb, Ty not coming
to your wedding

05:37.337 --> 05:39.839
is slightly different than him
missing the birth of his child.

05:39.881 --> 05:42.050
Get some perspective.
(Caleb laughs)

05:44.594 --> 05:46.096
I hate this place.

05:46.137 --> 05:48.890
Every time I come here,
I start to sweat.

05:48.932 --> 05:50.642
- The maternity ward
is upstairs.

05:50.684 --> 05:52.727
I'll take you there right away.

05:52.769 --> 05:55.980
Uh, we'll let your husband
know when you're settled in.

05:56.022 --> 05:57.899
- Oh, we're not married.

05:57.941 --> 06:01.027
Actually, I'm about to marry
someone else.

06:01.069 --> 06:04.489
Amy: And I'm not,
I'm not in labor.

06:04.531 --> 06:06.825
Thanks.

06:06.866 --> 06:08.743
- Did you see the look
on her face?

06:08.785 --> 06:09.869
- That was not funny.

06:09.911 --> 06:12.664
I mean, why did she even
think I was in labor?

06:12.706 --> 06:14.165
- In all fairness, you're kinda
waddling like a duck.

06:14.207 --> 06:16.418
No offence.
- None taken.

06:16.459 --> 06:18.211
Dr. Holt.

06:18.253 --> 06:21.256
- Amy. Good to see you.
- Yeah, you too.

06:21.297 --> 06:24.884
So, can my husband
come home today?

06:24.926 --> 06:27.053
- I can't do anything about it.
They've brought in a specialist

06:27.095 --> 06:28.972
just to make sure
I'm absolutely good to go,

06:29.014 --> 06:30.682
but they still wanna
run more tests.

06:30.724 --> 06:32.642
- More tests, why?!
- I don't know,

06:32.684 --> 06:34.352
but I can't leave until
they've done them.

06:34.394 --> 06:36.563
- So, you're basically
just a prisoner here?

06:39.733 --> 06:49.784
**

06:49.784 --> 06:55.165
**

06:55.206 --> 06:59.627
* And at the brake of day
you sank into your dream *

07:02.130 --> 07:04.007
* You dreamer *

07:04.049 --> 07:06.551
* Oh, oh, oh, oh *

07:06.593 --> 07:08.595
* You dreamer *

07:10.764 --> 07:14.642
* You dreamer *

07:20.065 --> 07:23.777
- Okay, so Brooklyn Maggie's
is still in trouble.

07:23.818 --> 07:27.113
Nicole said the other backers
are ready to pull out as well.

07:27.155 --> 07:30.158
I guess I'll take you up
on your offer.

07:31.826 --> 07:34.120
- You guess?

07:34.162 --> 07:36.831
- I mean, without it,
the Maggie's franchise

07:36.873 --> 07:38.667
is basically dead
in the water, so...

07:38.708 --> 07:41.044
- Right. And no one wants
to see that happen.

07:41.086 --> 07:43.588
So, we have a deal?

07:46.966 --> 07:49.678
- Deal.
- All right, partner.

07:50.762 --> 07:52.639
- Oh God.
(Peter chuckles)

07:57.227 --> 07:59.688
- Thank you.
- It's exciting.

08:00.814 --> 08:03.358
Jack: Georgie, this is crazy.

08:03.400 --> 08:06.152
My arthritis is finicky enough

08:06.194 --> 08:09.197
without going out searching
for some Ghost horse

08:09.239 --> 08:10.824
on a chilly morning.

08:10.865 --> 08:14.244
I don't know why
I ever agreed to this.

08:14.285 --> 08:16.329
(Distressed whinny)

08:16.371 --> 08:18.707
- Did you hear that?

08:20.083 --> 08:21.084
(Snorts)

08:21.126 --> 08:23.712
There he is.

08:25.672 --> 08:27.549
(Snorts)

08:28.800 --> 08:30.885
- And there he goes.

08:32.095 --> 08:34.222
You stay put. Hya!

08:34.264 --> 08:40.895
**

08:40.937 --> 08:42.897
(Hooves thunder)

08:42.938 --> 08:44.566
(Rope whooshes)

08:47.152 --> 08:48.236
(Snorts)

08:49.404 --> 08:50.864
(Whinnies)

08:52.240 --> 08:53.825
(Whinnies)

08:53.867 --> 08:56.077
- Woo, settle.

08:56.119 --> 08:58.079
Settle.

08:58.121 --> 08:59.998
- (Pants)

09:01.207 --> 09:02.667
- Hey.

09:02.709 --> 09:05.253
There you are.

09:05.295 --> 09:07.088
I have some news.

09:07.130 --> 09:10.550
- Oh yeah?
Let me take a wild stab.

09:10.592 --> 09:13.178
Peter pulled out all the stops
and got you your investor.

09:13.219 --> 09:15.096
- Yes. He did.

09:15.138 --> 09:17.182
How did you know?

09:17.223 --> 09:19.559
- Just a crazy hunch.

09:20.810 --> 09:22.896
- But there was a catch.

09:22.937 --> 09:24.773
The investor would only
go through with the deal

09:24.814 --> 09:26.858
if Peter bought in as well.

09:26.900 --> 09:29.110
- (Laughs) Okay.

09:29.152 --> 09:31.321
Here's another hunch.

09:31.363 --> 09:33.740
Your ex-husband is now
a partner in your project.

09:33.782 --> 09:36.868
- Silent partner.

09:36.910 --> 09:39.871
Mitch, I...
I didn't have a choice.

09:39.913 --> 09:42.165
Okay? The whole deal
was gonna fall through.

09:42.207 --> 09:46.419
- Business is business, right?
Whatever it takes.

09:46.461 --> 09:48.380
- Are you mad at me?

09:48.421 --> 09:51.007
- (Sighs) No.

09:51.049 --> 09:53.760
No.

09:53.802 --> 09:56.638
Okay, I, um...
I gotta go into town.

09:58.056 --> 09:59.891
- Okay.
- I'll see you.

09:59.933 --> 10:01.810
- Okay.

10:06.940 --> 10:08.733
Georgie: Hey, Hey, Hey.

10:10.193 --> 10:11.236
(Nervous snorting)
Woo.

10:11.277 --> 10:13.988
(Door slams, engine cuts out)

10:14.030 --> 10:15.240
(Nervous snorting)

10:15.281 --> 10:17.200
- What is that horse doing here?

10:17.242 --> 10:20.036
- Jack caught him.
- Why?

10:20.078 --> 10:22.205
- Because he needs a home.
It's obvious.

10:22.247 --> 10:23.873
That's why he keeps
showing up here.

10:23.915 --> 10:25.625
He's trying to tell us
something.

10:25.667 --> 10:27.794
Caleb: I think he's trying
to tell you he wants out.

10:29.295 --> 10:31.297
(Engine starts)

10:34.092 --> 10:37.762
Amy: Georgie, that horse
is not happy in a pen.

10:37.804 --> 10:39.472
You need to let him out.

10:39.514 --> 10:41.433
- No, I'm gonna gentle him.

10:41.474 --> 10:43.393
You tried. Jack said you did.

10:43.435 --> 10:47.063
- (Scoffs) Yeah,
I tried and it didn't work.

10:47.105 --> 10:49.399
- Well, that was years ago.
Can't you try again?

10:49.441 --> 10:51.901
- Obviously I can't.

10:51.943 --> 10:54.195
- Well, then let me.

10:54.237 --> 10:56.990
(Nervous snorting)

10:57.032 --> 11:00.201
- All I know is that horse is
not happy being cooped up.

11:05.915 --> 11:08.710
(Snorting)

11:12.297 --> 11:14.716
(Engine rumbles)

11:17.385 --> 11:19.888
(Engine shuts off)

11:19.929 --> 11:21.723
(Door slams)

11:22.849 --> 11:24.476
- What?

11:24.517 --> 11:28.396
- What we were talking about
earlier. I'm serious.

11:28.438 --> 11:29.814
- No.

11:29.856 --> 11:33.109
I don't need full time help,
especially not in the winter.

11:33.151 --> 11:35.111
- I know you rented
a year round arena.

11:35.153 --> 11:36.988
So you'll be going all year.

11:37.030 --> 11:39.074
You're gonna need help.

11:39.115 --> 11:41.993
Tim, Please.
C'mon, man, I need a job.

11:42.035 --> 11:44.162
- Why? And why me?

11:44.204 --> 11:46.247
- Okay, well, this may come
as a real shock to you,

11:46.289 --> 11:48.500
but Cass' parents
are a little leery about me

11:48.541 --> 11:50.460
and if we told them I didn't
have a full time job?

11:50.502 --> 11:52.295
Well, that just wouldn't
go over well.

11:52.337 --> 11:55.507
so, Cass, she may have told
her parents

11:55.548 --> 11:58.760
that I am employed... by you.

11:58.802 --> 12:02.555
And in fact, I'm a full partner
in the rodeo school.

12:02.597 --> 12:05.600
- (Sighs) No, Caleb,

12:05.642 --> 12:08.269
that is not how you
start a marriage.

12:08.311 --> 12:10.188
Not with a lie.
- Well, what am I gonna do?

12:10.230 --> 12:11.731
I mean, they're gonna be
at the wedding,

12:11.773 --> 12:13.441
they're gonna meet you
and they're gonna ask.

12:13.483 --> 12:15.110
- You're gonna have to work
that out with your bride.

12:15.151 --> 12:17.195
Now, move your truck.

12:20.198 --> 12:25.495
**

12:25.537 --> 12:27.205
- So, how's Ty?

12:27.247 --> 12:28.498
- I thought they were
letting him out today?

12:28.540 --> 12:30.375
- Yeah, but now they have
to run more tests.

12:30.417 --> 12:31.501
- Why more tests?

12:31.543 --> 12:33.336
- What? They still don't know
what's going on?

12:33.378 --> 12:35.213
- Dad, no. Now they're
bringing in a specialist.

12:35.255 --> 12:36.715
- A specialist?

12:36.756 --> 12:38.758
- They wanna be sure he doesn't
have any reoccurring infection.

12:38.800 --> 12:40.677
It makes sense.
- No. None of it makes sense.

12:40.719 --> 12:43.013
The guy is days away
from being a father,

12:43.054 --> 12:45.181
he's not gonna be there
for the birth.

12:45.223 --> 12:47.726
- Okay, that's enough.
- Well, here's a plan:

12:47.767 --> 12:50.145
why don't you have the baby
in his hospital room.

12:50.186 --> 12:51.396
That would be handy,
wouldn't it?

12:51.438 --> 12:53.565
- I told all of you,
I'm not having this baby

12:53.606 --> 12:55.734
at the hospital, okay?

12:55.775 --> 12:58.278
I spoke with my doctor today,
everything is fine.

12:58.319 --> 13:00.447
- What, you're still set
on having the baby in the barn?

13:00.488 --> 13:02.657
- You can't really call
the loft a barn.

13:02.699 --> 13:04.492
- A home birth with a midwife

13:04.534 --> 13:07.412
has always been my first plan,
Lou, you knew that.

13:07.454 --> 13:08.872
And besides...

13:08.913 --> 13:11.207
you were the one who told me
to go take classes with Margo

13:11.249 --> 13:13.168
in the first place.
- I know, Amy.

13:13.209 --> 13:15.545
- And you had Katie at home.
- Yeah, but not by choice.

13:15.587 --> 13:17.547
I mean, you and Ty
delivered Katie.

13:17.589 --> 13:18.798
Anything could've happened.

13:18.840 --> 13:20.967
- Yeah, well you're lucky
that me and Ty were there.

13:21.009 --> 13:22.385
- Amy?
- Okay.

13:22.427 --> 13:24.554
So, if your doctor gave you
the go ahead

13:24.596 --> 13:26.890
then I'm sure it's fine.
- (Sighs) Dad.

13:26.931 --> 13:29.726
You were at my prenatal classes
so you heard what Margo said:

13:29.768 --> 13:31.811
if everything looks fine
at your last appointment,

13:31.853 --> 13:33.563
then there's no reason that
you can't have a home birth

13:33.605 --> 13:36.232
with a midwife.
And Margo's gonna be there

13:36.274 --> 13:38.234
and the doctor can come
if there's a problem.

13:38.276 --> 13:39.736
- Yeah, and how long will it
take for your doctor

13:39.778 --> 13:41.279
to get here if there's
a problem?

13:41.321 --> 13:42.614
I'm just saying, Okay?

13:42.655 --> 13:45.116
I know this is your birth plan,
but the closer we get,

13:45.158 --> 13:47.577
the more your plan
is driving me crazy!

13:47.619 --> 13:51.039
- I'm actually not hungry.
I'm sorry, Lisa.

13:52.999 --> 13:54.542
- Nice.

13:54.584 --> 13:56.378
- You started it.

13:57.671 --> 13:59.381
- You know what?
I'm not hungry either.

13:59.422 --> 14:01.633
May I be excused, please?

14:01.675 --> 14:04.219
- (Sighs)

14:04.260 --> 14:05.804
Don't start, okay.

14:05.845 --> 14:08.098
I know, I shouldn't have
opened my big mouth.

14:08.139 --> 14:10.850
- Your sister is due
any day now.

14:10.892 --> 14:13.353
And she's under an unbelievable
amount of stress,

14:13.395 --> 14:15.021
what, with this whole Ty
situation.

14:15.063 --> 14:18.274
- Okay, I know. I'm sorry.

14:18.316 --> 14:19.317
(Receding footsteps)

14:20.610 --> 14:22.404
- Chicken.

14:25.740 --> 14:28.410
- Well, I can certainly see
why you're stressed.

14:28.451 --> 14:30.328
When did Peter make this offer?

14:30.370 --> 14:32.122
- Just the other day.

14:32.163 --> 14:34.624
- Please tell me you
did not jump at it.

14:34.666 --> 14:37.085
You did, didn't you?

14:37.127 --> 14:38.837
- I had to!

14:38.878 --> 14:40.422
This whole Maggie's deal
has come too far

14:40.463 --> 14:42.382
for me to let it fall apart.

14:42.424 --> 14:44.718
- I understand that, Lou,
but I promise you,

14:44.759 --> 14:47.220
putting Peter in the equation
is going to be a problem.

14:47.262 --> 14:50.515
Why have you not included
your dad?

14:50.557 --> 14:52.392
He's already a partner
in Maggie's.

14:52.434 --> 14:54.269
- I don't want him involved
anymore than he already is.

14:54.310 --> 14:56.146
Okay?

14:56.187 --> 14:59.649
Besides, mixing business
and family is never easy.

14:59.691 --> 15:02.193
- Well, you try mixing business
with an ex.

15:02.235 --> 15:04.946
Don't say I didn't try
to warn you.

15:07.699 --> 15:09.576
(Amy's cell phone rings)

15:11.119 --> 15:13.329
(Beeps phone on)
- Hey.

15:13.371 --> 15:14.914
- I just talked to Dr. Holt

15:14.956 --> 15:17.500
and apparently a lab technician
messed up my test results,

15:17.542 --> 15:19.711
so they gotta do it again.
- What?

15:19.753 --> 15:21.504
Ty: Yeah, and the specialist
is crazy busy,

15:21.546 --> 15:23.381
so who knows when
that's gonna be.

15:23.423 --> 15:24.591
And they're not gonna release me

15:24.632 --> 15:26.718
until those test results
come back so....

15:26.760 --> 15:29.763
- (Sighs) No. Ty.
- I know, this is insane.

15:29.804 --> 15:31.723
I mean, who knows when
I'm ever gonna get out of here.

15:31.765 --> 15:34.601
- But you're not contagious,
so I don't understand

15:34.642 --> 15:36.686
why you can't just wait
for the results at home?

15:36.728 --> 15:38.646
- That's what I said,
but I can't leave.

15:38.688 --> 15:41.191
They won't let me.

15:41.232 --> 15:43.360
Anyways, um, listen,

15:43.401 --> 15:45.403
Caleb keeps texting me
every ten seconds.

15:45.445 --> 15:47.655
Can you...can you just
talk to him for me?

15:47.697 --> 15:49.741
Make him see that he needs
to do his wedding without me?

15:49.783 --> 15:53.411
- Okay, forget about Caleb,
I need you here.

15:53.453 --> 15:55.372
I need you here
when this baby's born.

15:55.413 --> 15:57.165
- And I will be, Amy, okay?

15:57.207 --> 15:59.292
I promise. No matter what.

16:04.381 --> 16:06.257
- They're not gonna let him out?

16:06.299 --> 16:09.260
No. (Whines) No,
I need my best man.

16:09.302 --> 16:12.806
- Caleb, this wedding
is not about me or Ty,

16:12.847 --> 16:15.934
it's about you and Cassandra.
It's gonna be amazing.

16:15.975 --> 16:17.894
Ty can't go against
what his doctor ordered.

16:17.936 --> 16:19.979
- I know, I know.
- She saved his life.

16:20.021 --> 16:22.732
- I know and I appreciate that.
I do, but it's just...

16:22.774 --> 16:25.276
I'm nervous.
I'm gonna be a mess.

16:25.318 --> 16:26.778
- You're gonna be fine.

16:26.820 --> 16:29.489
- Cassandra will be right there
next to you.

16:29.531 --> 16:32.367
- Okay, you're right.
I can do this.

16:32.409 --> 16:34.786
And look I know you're worried
too, about the baby.

16:34.828 --> 16:37.080
And I promise,
if Ty can't be there for you,

16:37.122 --> 16:38.623
I will.

16:38.665 --> 16:40.709
- Thanks Caleb.

16:40.750 --> 16:43.378
Hey, I gotta run.
I told Ty I'd give him a call.

16:46.673 --> 16:56.599

17:18.371 --> 17:19.122
(Clicks tongue)

17:19.164 --> 17:21.958
Get!

17:22.000 --> 17:24.544
(Clicks tongue) Get!

17:26.628 --> 17:29.674
Good boy.

17:29.716 --> 17:31.593

Ghost, No!

17:55.283 --> 17:56.868
- What is that, a Mustang?

17:56.910 --> 17:58.870
- Yeah.

17:58.912 --> 18:00.372
(Hooves thud, snorts)

18:00.413 --> 18:02.499
- I'm gonna try to gentle him.

18:02.540 --> 18:03.875
Mitch: You are, are you?

18:03.917 --> 18:06.378
I hope you have endless time
and patience.

18:06.419 --> 18:08.630
Kind of like dealing
with your sister.

18:10.632 --> 18:14.302
Hey, Georgie, uh,
you seen your mom around?

18:14.344 --> 18:15.929
I can't get a hold of her.

18:15.970 --> 18:18.390
No, I think she went out.

18:18.431 --> 18:20.392
- Okay.

18:20.433 --> 18:21.893
Thanks.

18:21.935 --> 18:24.854
Well, good luck with that guy.

18:24.896 --> 18:26.648
It looks like he'd rather
be anywhere, but here.

18:31.569 --> 18:33.613
I know what you're thinking.

18:36.950 --> 18:39.577
(Hooves thud, snorts)

18:40.912 --> 18:43.081
Lou: You gotta be kidding me!

18:43.123 --> 18:44.874
Did you tell him that
you were willing to step up?

18:44.916 --> 18:47.043
- I told him that I'd be
investing too, yeah,

18:47.085 --> 18:49.087
but he walked away.

18:49.129 --> 18:50.880
He just, he changed his mind,
Lou.

18:50.922 --> 18:52.465
- Well, that's it then.
It's done.

18:54.551 --> 18:58.680
- Well, um, not necessarily.

19:00.765 --> 19:02.726
Look, I believe in what
you're doing here.

19:02.767 --> 19:05.937
And more than that,
I-I believe in you.

19:05.979 --> 19:08.648
- What are you saying?

19:08.690 --> 19:10.859
- I'll come in with the
full amount that you need.

19:12.277 --> 19:14.487
- Wow, um, Peter...

19:17.866 --> 19:19.492
you don't have to do that.

19:19.534 --> 19:22.162
(stammers) I don't know
if that's a good idea.

19:22.203 --> 19:24.539
- Well, hey, look,
what I don't want

19:24.581 --> 19:26.708
is for all your hard work,

19:26.750 --> 19:28.752
not to mention the passion
you put in for this project

19:28.793 --> 19:30.545
to go to waste, okay?

19:32.005 --> 19:33.923
I wanna do this for you.

19:33.965 --> 19:36.885
- Are you sure about this?
- Absolutely.

19:38.678 --> 19:40.680
- Ah...

19:40.722 --> 19:43.683
Shoot. I forgot I have an
appointment in town um,

19:43.725 --> 19:45.602
but I'm gonna think about that,
okay?

19:45.643 --> 19:48.688
Your offer, it's so generous.
Really.

19:48.730 --> 19:50.482
I just, I gotta run, okay?

19:50.523 --> 19:51.900
- Okay.

brother.

20:32.774 --> 20:34.984
- I need you at my wedding
tomorrow and there is no way

20:35.026 --> 20:37.654
I am standing up in a church
filled with people without you.

20:37.696 --> 20:40.532
- Caleb?
No, man, I can't leave.

20:40.573 --> 20:42.534

20:42.575 --> 20:44.452
- Right.

20:44.494 --> 20:46.746
- And you're not contagious,
right?

20:46.788 --> 20:48.623

- Hey, Amy.

21:45.889 --> 21:48.767
- This is amazing!

21:48.808 --> 21:52.520
(Sighs) They...they did
release you, right?

21:52.562 --> 21:55.607
- Well, not exactly, um...

21:55.648 --> 21:58.610
- You went AWOL? Are you crazy?

21:58.651 --> 22:00.570
- Yes I am.
- Hey.

22:00.612 --> 22:02.947
Good to see you on your feet.
- Thank you.

22:02.989 --> 22:04.741
- So they finally let you out.

22:04.783 --> 22:07.619
- Well, actually I sprung
him out.

22:07.660 --> 22:09.079
It's just like
"The Great Escape."

22:09.120 --> 22:10.246
Super awesome, man.

22:10.288 --> 22:12.457
- You sprung him out?

22:12.499 --> 22:13.667
- Yeah, yeah.

22:13.708 --> 22:15.043
- Genius.

22:15.085 --> 22:16.961
- You guys are all crazy.

22:17.003 --> 22:19.422
(Happy laugh)

22:19.464 --> 22:23.134
**

22:23.176 --> 22:24.886
- I understand.

22:27.722 --> 22:30.642
Well, thank you, Dr. Holt,
I appreciate that.

22:30.684 --> 22:32.894
Okay, thanks.

22:32.936 --> 22:35.063
Bye.
(Phone beeps off)

22:35.105 --> 22:37.565
Okay, so I gotta reprieve.

22:37.607 --> 22:38.942
- How?

22:38.983 --> 22:41.152
- Well, I told her the truth,

22:41.194 --> 22:44.239
that your doctor said you could
go into labor at any moment

22:44.280 --> 22:46.491
and I need to be here, I just
have to report back after.

22:46.533 --> 22:47.992
- After what?

22:48.034 --> 22:50.954
The birth of our child
or Caleb's wedding?

22:50.995 --> 22:53.873
- I was kind of vague
about that part.

22:53.915 --> 22:55.792
(Both laugh)

22:55.834 --> 22:57.794
-You do realize that
this is the first time

22:57.836 --> 23:02.007
we've been alone together
in our loft for months?

23:02.048 --> 23:05.468
- Yeah. Not since I left
for Mongolia.

23:05.510 --> 23:06.845
- Yeah.

23:06.886 --> 23:09.639
Welcome home, stranger.

23:09.681 --> 23:11.266
- Thank you.

23:11.307 --> 23:12.559
(Giggles)

23:14.561 --> 23:17.814
Georgie: Oh, it's okay.

23:17.856 --> 23:19.691
Ah!

23:19.733 --> 23:21.234
(Clicks tongue)

23:21.276 --> 23:23.778
(Nervous snorting)

23:23.820 --> 23:38.543
**

23:38.585 --> 23:42.714
**

23:42.756 --> 23:44.758
- Can we talk?

23:46.092 --> 23:48.470
- Hm. That doesn't sound good.

23:49.763 --> 23:52.015
- Look.

23:52.057 --> 23:54.184
I know that you hate
that Peter is involved

23:54.225 --> 23:57.645
with this Maggie's deal at all,
but guess what?

23:57.687 --> 23:59.981
The other guy dropped out

24:00.023 --> 24:03.151
and Peter has offered to be
the sole investor.

24:03.193 --> 24:05.445
- Of course he has.

24:05.487 --> 24:08.239
- And if I say no,
I run the risk of--

24:08.281 --> 24:11.785
- Losing everything.
Yeah, I know.

24:11.826 --> 24:13.870
- I haven't given him
an answer yet.

24:13.912 --> 24:15.830
But if I say yes,
it is strictly business.

24:15.872 --> 24:18.333
Nothing more.

24:18.375 --> 24:21.086
And let's face it, Mitch,
I've run out of options here.

24:22.879 --> 24:24.839
What should I do?

24:27.926 --> 24:31.680
- Okay, how about a little
you and me alone time

24:33.348 --> 24:36.017
and we can talk about it.

24:36.059 --> 24:38.687
- Yes. I would love that,
Mitch, but I can't.

24:38.728 --> 24:40.397
I can't, I have -
(They kiss)

24:40.438 --> 24:43.274
I have a million errands
to run, okay?

24:43.316 --> 24:45.443
- Okay.

24:45.485 --> 24:48.196
Okay. Yeah.
Oh, Lou, before you go,

24:48.238 --> 24:49.781
you've got to give me
the details on this wedding.

24:49.823 --> 24:51.449
Do you still need me
to pick you up?

24:51.491 --> 24:54.327
- Right, um, Peter was supposed
to fly out tonight,

24:54.369 --> 24:56.913
but we have this deal
to work out now, so--

24:56.955 --> 24:59.833
- So, he's coming
to the wedding?

24:59.874 --> 25:01.918
- (Huffs) Would you rather
I didn't come then?

25:01.960 --> 25:04.504
- No, no, of course not.

25:04.546 --> 25:07.048
- Lou, you're,
you're killing me here.

25:07.090 --> 25:09.092
- What? Why?
- Face it.

25:09.134 --> 25:10.885
You can't bring yourself
to go to a wedding with me

25:10.927 --> 25:14.097
if Peter's gonna be there.
- That is not true.

25:14.139 --> 25:17.225
- Okay, then, yeah,
I'll come with you.

25:19.144 --> 25:21.354
You see you're uncomfortable.
I get it.

25:21.396 --> 25:24.315
But Lou, I still think there's
something between you too.

25:24.357 --> 25:26.985
- Of course there is, Mitch,
it's called two kids.

25:27.027 --> 25:28.570
But that's it.

25:29.821 --> 25:32.073
You know what?
Come to the wedding, okay?

25:32.115 --> 25:34.701
I will text you the details.

25:34.743 --> 25:37.787
Yes?

25:37.829 --> 25:39.456
- Yes.
- Okay.

25:39.497 --> 25:41.916
I'll see you tomorrow.

25:41.958 --> 25:43.626
- See ya.

25:43.668 --> 25:50.967
**

25:51.009 --> 25:53.219
Ty: You ready, Amy?

25:53.261 --> 25:56.306
- Yes. These shoes are way
too tight!

25:56.348 --> 25:58.475
And, Ty, look at this dress.

25:58.516 --> 26:01.144
When I tried it on in the
fitting, it was fine, but now--

26:01.186 --> 26:03.229
- Amy, you look great.
You look beautiful.

26:03.271 --> 26:05.523
- No, I don't.
- Yes, you do.

26:05.565 --> 26:07.859
Caleb: Yo, you guys up there?

26:07.901 --> 26:09.277
(Footsteps clop on the stairs)

26:09.319 --> 26:11.488
- Doesn't she look beautiful?
- Stunning.

26:11.529 --> 26:13.907
- Thanks, Caleb. You look
very handsome yourself.

26:13.948 --> 26:15.992
- Thank you.
Uh, bouquet for the lady.

26:16.034 --> 26:17.911
- Thank you.
- Tiny flowers for the man.

26:17.952 --> 26:19.371
And I don't mean to put
pressure on you guys,

26:19.412 --> 26:21.164
but I told Cass I'd be
at the church early.

26:21.206 --> 26:23.541
Already running pretty late.
- Okay, well let's do this.

26:23.583 --> 26:25.168
Are we taking my truck?
- Oh, no-no.

26:25.210 --> 26:27.128
I got this crazy vehicle
for us.

26:30.965 --> 26:32.425
Woo!

26:32.467 --> 26:34.386
And there's even tons
of room for Amy.

26:34.427 --> 26:36.304
Not that you're, uh,
big or anything.

26:39.182 --> 26:41.184
Let's get this party started.
- All right, man.

26:41.226 --> 26:42.977
- You know, they had one
with a hot tub too.

26:43.019 --> 26:44.938
Kind of kicking myself.

26:44.979 --> 26:46.189
(Car engine starts)

26:46.231 --> 26:47.816
(Door slams)

26:47.857 --> 26:49.943
(Rumbles away)

26:54.030 --> 26:55.865
Caleb: I'm nervous.
Ty: You're gonna do great, man.

26:55.907 --> 26:57.325
- I hope so.

26:57.367 --> 26:58.743
- (Groans in discomfort)

26:58.785 --> 27:00.370
- You okay?
- Yeah.

27:00.412 --> 27:02.080
- Yeah, you sure?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

27:02.122 --> 27:07.836
**

27:07.877 --> 27:09.087
Caleb: All right.

27:09.129 --> 27:10.547
Ty: Easy now.

27:10.588 --> 27:12.465
- Here let me give you
a hand out of there.

27:12.507 --> 27:15.468
Ty: You okay?
Caleb: You okay?

27:15.510 --> 27:16.928
Ty: Amy, are you...?
Are you...?

27:16.970 --> 27:19.014
- Um...
- Uh, we need to go.

27:20.181 --> 27:22.058
We need to go home now.
Ty: Yeah, okay.

27:22.100 --> 27:26.187
Caleb: Back in the limo.
Back in the limo, come on.

27:26.229 --> 27:28.314
Cassandra: Caleb!

27:28.356 --> 27:29.941
You're supposed to be
in the church!

27:29.983 --> 27:32.318
You aren't supposed to see me
before the wedding!

27:32.360 --> 27:34.571
- I didn't see anything.
- What are you doing?

27:34.612 --> 27:36.948
- Look, (stammers nervously)
I gotta go.

27:36.990 --> 27:38.366
- But where are you going.

27:38.408 --> 27:40.910
- Okay let's go.
- Go, go.

27:40.952 --> 27:43.455
- Are you just... are you
leaving me at the alter?

27:43.496 --> 27:44.914
Ty: Okay, we're going,
we're going.

27:44.956 --> 27:46.499
Caleb?
- Yeah?

27:46.541 --> 27:48.877
What are you doing here, man?
You, you got a wedding.

27:48.918 --> 27:50.587
Hey, buddy, stop the car.
Stop, stop.

27:50.628 --> 27:52.547
You gotta get to the church,
man. What are you doing here?

27:52.589 --> 27:55.091
- You guys take the limo.
Amy: Yeah. (Groans)

27:55.133 --> 27:56.968
- You sure you're all right?
- Okay, just go get married!

27:57.010 --> 27:58.678
- Good luck.
Caleb: Bye guys.

27:58.720 --> 28:03.183
- Caleb, what are you doing?
Don't you wanna marry me?

28:03.224 --> 28:06.436
- Of course I wanna marry you.
But honey, Amy's having a baby.

28:06.478 --> 28:09.314
- What?!

28:09.356 --> 28:12.192
- Wow, you look so beautiful.

28:17.364 --> 28:20.200
You wanna marry me?
- Yeah.

28:26.664 --> 28:29.417
- Where are you, Mitch?

28:29.459 --> 28:32.128
Cass, you look beautiful.

28:32.170 --> 28:34.047
Caleb, Where's Amy?
Where's Ty?

28:34.089 --> 28:36.508
- Amy's having the baby.
- What?

28:36.549 --> 28:38.843
- Yeah, we gotta get going.
- Yeah, uh...

28:38.885 --> 28:41.179
Peter! Peter!

28:41.221 --> 28:43.056
(Engine hums)

28:49.646 --> 28:52.190
Peter, hurry up. Let's go.
C'mon, c'mon, c'mon.

28:52.232 --> 28:55.110
- Okay. What about the wedding?
- Forget the wedding. Hurry.

28:55.151 --> 28:56.778
- I'm kidding. Let's get in.

28:59.072 --> 29:02.409
**

29:02.450 --> 29:04.160
Ty: Are you okay?
Amy: Yeah.

29:04.202 --> 29:05.704
Ty: Yeah?
Just keep breathing, all right,

29:05.745 --> 29:07.372
just keep breathing.
- I'm trying!

29:07.414 --> 29:09.708
- Hey, Lou. Yeah. Yeah.

29:09.749 --> 29:12.544
She's in labor right now,
we're heading home.

29:12.585 --> 29:15.171
- Why don't she--
- No, Lou, listen,

29:15.213 --> 29:16.673
you gotta stop yelling, Lou,

29:16.715 --> 29:18.258
We're not going to the hospital
right now.

29:18.299 --> 29:20.510
- No, Lou, I'm going home.
Tell her--

29:20.552 --> 29:22.554
Can you get off the phone
and call Margo, please?

29:22.595 --> 29:23.847
- I will, I will, Amy.

29:23.888 --> 29:26.599
Listen, Lou, I gotta go. I'll
call you back, okay? Okay.

29:26.641 --> 29:28.435
- Okay, tell her to meet us
at the house

29:28.476 --> 29:31.104
and then call Dr. Adler
and say that I'm in labor.

29:31.146 --> 29:32.897
- Breathe, Amy, breathe.
Breathe.

29:32.939 --> 29:34.274
Straight to voicemail.

29:34.315 --> 29:36.359
I'm gonna leave her a message,
okay?

29:36.401 --> 29:38.987
Margo! Hi, it's Ty Borden.
Amy's husband.

29:39.029 --> 29:40.155
Listen, she's in labor
right now,

29:40.196 --> 29:42.115
we're heading to Heartland.
Can you meet us there

29:42.157 --> 29:45.035
as soon as you possible?
Thanks. Call me.

29:45.076 --> 29:46.995
- Oh my God.
- Okay, just relax, Amy.

29:47.037 --> 29:49.539
Just relax, we'll be okay.

29:49.581 --> 29:51.291
We'll be okay.
Breathe. Yeah, that's good.

29:51.332 --> 29:52.917
(Rumbles up)

29:55.128 --> 29:56.921
Okay, here we are.

29:58.590 --> 30:01.259
You're home now. You're okay.

30:01.301 --> 30:03.303
- Did you get a hold
of Margo yet?

30:03.345 --> 30:05.221
- I called, then I left
her some messages.

30:05.263 --> 30:07.223
- Messages? We've got to get
Amy to the hospital!

30:07.265 --> 30:08.683
Sir, can you take us
to the hospital?

30:08.725 --> 30:11.269
Peter: Lou, calm down.
- I'm calm. I'm really calm.

30:11.311 --> 30:13.021
Ty: Okay, now.

30:14.272 --> 30:16.441
All right?
- Yeah.

30:16.483 --> 30:19.235
- Okay, let's get you settled.
- Amy, I'm here for you!

30:19.277 --> 30:20.737
I'll get her out of her dress,
Ty.

30:20.779 --> 30:22.614
- Oh, okay.
- I got you, honey.

30:22.655 --> 30:25.283
Oh, I got you.
- I'll get this out of the way.

30:25.325 --> 30:27.535
Lou: All right, in we go.
I got you.

30:27.577 --> 30:29.579
Okay, let's get your coat off.
Amy: Okay.

30:29.621 --> 30:32.457
- Yeah, just give me a second,
Amy, let me try...

30:32.499 --> 30:34.501
- I can do it, Lou!
- No-no-no, you just relax...

30:34.542 --> 30:36.461
...I'll pull the sleeve.
Amy: Okay. Okay. Just stop it!

30:36.503 --> 30:39.130
Tim: Okay, I just heard.
I'm here. Where is she?

30:39.172 --> 30:41.591
- She's with Lou.
Just hold on though, okay?

30:41.633 --> 30:44.302
- I'm her coach.
- She's getting changed.

30:44.344 --> 30:46.179
- Amy, breathe, honey,
just breathe!

30:46.221 --> 30:47.514
You know the drill.

30:47.555 --> 30:49.349
- Margo, the contractions
are getting closer together.

30:49.391 --> 30:51.851
Amy is in labor!
Call me back, please!

30:51.893 --> 30:54.729
She's not answering. I told her
this was a stupid idea.

30:54.771 --> 30:56.856
Amy, I told you this
was a stupid idea!

30:56.898 --> 30:59.401
- Lou, you know what? Please,
I do not need this right now.

30:59.442 --> 31:01.778
Just leave.
Lou: Okay.

31:01.820 --> 31:04.197
Yeah, I'll just, I'll come back
and check on you.

31:04.239 --> 31:07.659
Oh my God.
- Just breathe, Lou.

31:07.701 --> 31:11.121
Okay. Amy, you're coach is here.

31:11.162 --> 31:13.373
(Barn doors swing open)

31:13.415 --> 31:15.834
Peter: Hey.
- How's Amy?

31:15.875 --> 31:18.128
Peter: I don't know.
- The girls are in the house.

31:18.169 --> 31:21.297
- Margo, answer the phone.
Amy's having this baby.

31:21.339 --> 31:23.508
- Lou, you gotta calm down.

31:23.550 --> 31:26.094
- I'm calm, okay, Peter?
Don't tell me to calm down!

31:26.136 --> 31:28.304
- I'm gonna check on the girls.

31:28.346 --> 31:30.473
- Where's Margo?
You know, where is she?

31:30.515 --> 31:33.601
I'm gonna call Dr. Adler.
That's what I'm gonna do.

31:33.643 --> 31:35.311
- Breathe, okay?

31:35.353 --> 31:37.647
- Yeah, he's right.
Breathe, just breathe.

31:37.689 --> 31:41.818
- I am trying! Please,
just give me some space.

31:41.860 --> 31:45.613
- Okay. It's okay, Amy.
Here, here, take my hand.

31:45.655 --> 31:47.365
Breathe, Amy.
Just breathe, okay?

31:47.407 --> 31:48.950
- Ty. Ty.

31:50.285 --> 31:52.412
- Okay, just one second.
There you go.

31:52.454 --> 31:53.663
- Ty.
- What?!

31:53.705 --> 31:55.040
- (Grunts) Don't go.

31:55.081 --> 31:56.374
- Okay, just...

31:56.416 --> 31:58.543
Amy, just need to...
I just need to...

31:58.585 --> 31:59.586
- Ty!
- I'll be right back, okay?

31:59.627 --> 32:00.545
What?
- Where's Margo?

32:00.587 --> 32:02.589
She should be here by now.

32:02.630 --> 32:05.467
- If worst comes to worst,
I can deliver this baby, okay.

32:06.760 --> 32:09.054
- You're a vet!

32:13.308 --> 32:15.477
- No, get that Amy
wants a midwife,

32:15.518 --> 32:17.604
that she trusts a midwife,

32:17.645 --> 32:19.856
but what good is a midwife
if she's not here

32:19.898 --> 32:21.816
when she needs to be.

32:21.858 --> 32:24.527
- I am here, Lou.
- Oh, thank goodness.

32:24.569 --> 32:26.529
- Nice to see you too.
Where's Amy?

32:26.571 --> 32:28.073
Everyone: Upstairs!

32:29.407 --> 32:30.658
Ty: I wouldn't miss this, Amy.

32:30.700 --> 32:32.410
Amy: Ty, I'm so glad
you're here.

32:32.452 --> 32:34.371
Ty: You're dong amazing.
Just breathe.

32:34.412 --> 32:37.582
- Margo, she's in the
transitional stage right now.

32:37.624 --> 32:39.584
That-that's what the book says.

32:39.626 --> 32:41.544
- That's it.
Amy, you're doing great.

32:41.586 --> 32:44.089
Okay, and baby's doing great.

32:44.130 --> 32:45.882
Good.

32:45.924 --> 32:48.343
Now I want you to stop pushing
for the moment, okay?

32:48.385 --> 32:50.178
- Okay.

32:50.220 --> 32:52.138
- All right. All right.

32:52.180 --> 32:54.224
You're almost there.

32:54.265 --> 32:55.558
- Just breathe, Amy.
Just breathe.

32:55.600 --> 32:57.352
Margo: Just breathe.

32:57.394 --> 32:59.521
Baby's crowning. Okay.

32:59.562 --> 33:01.898
(Screams in pain)

33:01.940 --> 33:04.401
- Good, good. Chin down, honey.

33:04.442 --> 33:06.569
Oh! Okay. I think the chin--

33:06.611 --> 33:08.697
- Baby's doing great. Okay?

33:10.949 --> 33:12.409
(Approaching footsteps)

33:12.450 --> 33:13.868
Lisa: Hey.
- Hey.

33:13.910 --> 33:16.621
Lisa: How is she?
- Uh, good. They're all good.

33:16.663 --> 33:18.498
Yeah.

33:18.540 --> 33:20.291
- Way to go, coach. Nice job.
- Thanks.

33:20.333 --> 33:22.377
- I feel like I should be
up there with her.

33:22.419 --> 33:24.337
Like, I should check on her.
- Oh no. Honey, they're fine.

33:24.379 --> 33:26.006
They're fine without you -
even you.

33:27.799 --> 33:29.259
- Hey.
- Hi.

33:29.300 --> 33:31.553
- Baby? Oh.
- No, not yet.

33:31.594 --> 33:33.680
- So, you two got married?

33:34.848 --> 33:36.933
Caleb: Yes we did.

33:36.975 --> 33:38.768
- Caleb was incredible.

33:38.810 --> 33:40.395
I thought he was running
out on me,

33:40.437 --> 33:41.938
but he was just so concerned
for Amy,

33:41.980 --> 33:43.690
he wouldn't leave her side.

33:43.732 --> 33:45.775
Lisa: Well, look at you.
Come here.

33:45.817 --> 33:47.527
How's Amy?
Lou: She's okay,

33:47.569 --> 33:48.611
but you know,
it took Margo two hours...

33:48.653 --> 33:50.321
- Good for you.
- Thanks.

33:50.363 --> 33:52.449
So we decided something.

33:52.490 --> 33:54.325
We're gonna tell Cass's parents
the truth.

33:54.367 --> 33:56.327
You were right.

33:56.369 --> 33:58.830
You can't start a marriage
with a lie.

33:58.872 --> 34:01.750
- Well, it wouldn't be a lie
if I hired you.

34:03.710 --> 34:05.670
(Sighs)

34:05.712 --> 34:07.464
What? You're full of surprises,
Caleb.

34:07.505 --> 34:09.341
You sprung your buddy, Ty,
from the hospital,

34:09.382 --> 34:10.884
so he could be with Amy.

34:10.925 --> 34:13.969
You were there for Amy
when she needed you the most.

34:14.012 --> 34:16.222
I'm impressed. You're hired.

34:17.349 --> 34:19.434
- Thanks. Thanks, Tim!

34:21.311 --> 34:23.980
- Yeah. Don't screw it up.

34:24.022 --> 34:26.858
- Okay, you're gonna give me
one big push, okay, Amy?

34:26.900 --> 34:29.485
Take a deep breath.
Baby's ready.

34:29.527 --> 34:32.030
Ty: Okay. That's it, Amy.
You got it, you got it.

34:32.072 --> 34:33.864
(Effort grunts)
You got it.

34:33.907 --> 34:36.284
(Big exhale)
- Looks good.

34:38.745 --> 34:40.580
Caleb: So, how's this
for a wedding night?

34:40.621 --> 34:41.956
Cass: It's pretty eventful.

34:41.998 --> 34:43.792
(Baby cries)

34:47.253 --> 34:49.297
(Lisa giggles)

34:49.339 --> 34:50.799
(Happy exhale)

34:50.840 --> 34:53.092
(Happy laughter)

34:54.511 --> 34:56.471
(Snorting)

34:56.513 --> 34:57.764
(Baby cries)

34:58.765 --> 34:59.766
**

35:08.817 --> 35:10.944
- Hi!
- It's a girl.

35:10.985 --> 35:13.947
- Hey. Oh, she's beautiful.
- It's a girl, Amy.

35:13.988 --> 35:16.282
- Yeah, she is.
- Hey.

35:16.324 --> 35:18.159
- She's perfect.
- Hey.

35:19.411 --> 35:22.247
- You're amazing, Amy.

35:23.790 --> 35:25.834
- Hey... sweetheart. It's okay.

35:27.460 --> 35:29.629
(Happy laughter)

35:31.464 --> 35:33.717
Hey...

35:33.758 --> 35:35.510
- You were amazing.

35:37.303 --> 35:37.637
Hey...

35:39.806 --> 35:41.558
Hey...

35:41.599 --> 35:43.560
(Ghost whinnies loudly)

35:43.601 --> 35:45.186
(Amy laughs)

35:49.941 --> 35:56.614
**

35:56.656 --> 35:58.658
- I love this chair, grandpa.

35:58.700 --> 36:01.411
- Well, we finished it
just in time, didn't we, Lis.

36:01.453 --> 36:03.621
- Yeah.
- Well, thank you, both of you.

36:03.663 --> 36:05.707
- Oh, you're so cute.

36:07.000 --> 36:09.544
- She's so wonderful.

36:09.586 --> 36:11.713
- Amy, you were wonderful.

36:12.839 --> 36:14.341
- So was my coach.

36:15.467 --> 36:17.635
So were you.

36:17.677 --> 36:20.013
- I think she kinda
looks like me.

36:20.055 --> 36:21.931
- (Chuckles)

36:21.973 --> 36:23.892
- Actually, she's the spitting
image of Marion

36:23.933 --> 36:26.478
when she was born.

36:26.519 --> 36:29.564
Amy: Well, mom would be happy.

36:29.606 --> 36:31.608
- We haven't picked out
a first name yet,

36:31.649 --> 36:33.485
but Amy and I were thinking,
for her middle name,

36:33.526 --> 36:35.695
we would call her--
- Marion.

36:35.737 --> 36:38.406
Lisa: Oh, that's lovely.
Lou: Oh. I'm so glad.

36:38.448 --> 36:39.783
Amy: I think it suits her.

36:39.824 --> 36:41.493
Lou: Yeah, it does.

36:41.534 --> 36:43.745
(Horse whinnies outside)

36:49.167 --> 36:51.753
(Nervous snorting
and whinnying)

36:51.795 --> 36:56.007
**

36:56.049 --> 36:57.926
- I need to go calm him down.

36:57.967 --> 36:59.469
It's not working.

36:59.511 --> 37:01.638
I tried, Jack. I really did,

37:01.680 --> 37:04.182
but he's not happy.

37:04.224 --> 37:06.142
- Well, you can't force some
things to happen

37:06.184 --> 37:08.770
no matter how hard you try.

37:08.812 --> 37:11.439
(Ghost whinnies)

37:15.902 --> 37:17.028
(Hooves thud, nervous snorting)

37:17.070 --> 37:24.202
**

37:24.244 --> 37:26.621
(Hooves thud, nervous snorting)

37:28.123 --> 37:30.375
(Distressed whinny)

37:30.417 --> 37:38.675
**

37:38.717 --> 37:40.802
(Latch clinks)

37:43.888 --> 37:50.979
**

37:51.021 --> 37:52.480
(Happy exhales)

37:58.111 --> 38:00.321
(Phone rings)

38:01.740 --> 38:04.659
(Baby coos)

38:04.701 --> 38:05.994
(Beeps phone on)

38:06.036 --> 38:07.662
- Dr. Holt.

38:08.955 --> 38:12.042
Yeah, yeah. The baby was born
last night.

38:12.083 --> 38:13.835
It's a girl!

38:15.211 --> 38:16.504
Thank you!

38:18.923 --> 38:20.675
Oh, you're kidding!

38:21.968 --> 38:24.471
(Sighs) Well, that's great news.

38:25.597 --> 38:26.765
Yeah. Thank you.

38:26.806 --> 38:28.099
Okay. We'll talk later!

38:28.141 --> 38:29.517
Okay, bye.

38:29.559 --> 38:30.727
Lou: Here you go, Lisa.

38:30.769 --> 38:32.645
- Just got off the phone
with the doctor,

38:32.687 --> 38:34.147
the results came back,
they're all clear!

38:34.189 --> 38:35.774
I'm officially a free man!

38:35.815 --> 38:37.776
Lisa: Congratulations.

38:37.817 --> 38:41.112
- A free man?
Oh, I don't think so.

38:41.154 --> 38:43.073
(Small laugh)
Not for a long time.

38:43.114 --> 38:44.032
- (Chuckles)

38:46.743 --> 38:49.579
(Chuckles)
(Baby coos)

38:49.621 --> 38:50.955
Peter: Sorry, I have to leave.

38:50.997 --> 38:52.999
I gotta get things going
at the bank

38:53.041 --> 38:57.837
and uh, they're gonna send you
those papers to sign too so...

38:57.879 --> 39:01.132
But you know what
I was thinking is...

39:01.174 --> 39:03.843
why don't you come to Vancouver
to sign the papers?

39:03.885 --> 39:07.055
And that way we can spend
some time together.

39:07.097 --> 39:09.224
Maybe go out to dinner.

39:09.265 --> 39:11.559
Make a thing of it, you know?

39:11.601 --> 39:13.645
I'll be fun. What do you say?

39:13.687 --> 39:16.064
- Peter, I haven't actually
said yes

39:16.106 --> 39:17.732
to your business proposal yet.

39:19.984 --> 39:22.737
- Oh. Uh... I just assumed.

39:22.779 --> 39:23.988
- No, I know.

39:24.030 --> 39:26.908
And I would, I would love
to say yes.

39:26.950 --> 39:29.327
I mean, I hate the idea of
losing the Maggie's project.

39:29.369 --> 39:32.163
It's...it's almost unthinkable.

39:32.205 --> 39:34.958
Um... but even more than that,

39:35.000 --> 39:38.086
I hate the idea of wrecking
what you and I have.

39:38.128 --> 39:40.130
- It's not gonna wreck it.

39:40.171 --> 39:42.173
- Well, it might... it might.

39:42.215 --> 39:44.884
Peter, because something
feels wrong.

39:44.926 --> 39:47.804
Something, it feels like
you think this is a way

39:47.846 --> 39:49.973
of keeping us involved,

39:50.015 --> 39:51.933
together...

39:54.185 --> 39:56.271
- No. That's...

39:56.312 --> 39:59.149
that is not why I offered.

39:59.190 --> 40:02.569
- It was so generous of you
to offer to help me.

40:03.737 --> 40:06.448
But it wouldn't be good for us.

40:07.240 --> 40:09.743
Or me.

40:12.287 --> 40:15.123
- That's, that's really
how you feel?

40:16.916 --> 40:19.544
- Yeah. I do.

40:22.881 --> 40:24.966
- Okay. Okay...

40:27.927 --> 40:29.804
I mean, I do get that things
are good

40:29.846 --> 40:33.183
with us and the kids the way
they are.

40:33.224 --> 40:36.144
I do get that. I...

40:36.186 --> 40:37.645
- Yeah. This-I...

40:37.687 --> 40:39.647
This is for the best.

40:41.107 --> 40:42.650
- Okay.

40:45.070 --> 40:47.614
- Hey... thank you.

40:49.240 --> 40:53.244
- Yeah. If you change your
mind, give me a call me.

40:53.286 --> 40:54.662
