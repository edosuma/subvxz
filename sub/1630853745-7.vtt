WEBVTT

00:02.085 --> 00:03.211
Previously, on
"Below Deck Mediterranean"...

00:04.379 --> 00:07.048
Welcome, Courtney.

00:07.090 --> 00:08.341
I'm back!

00:19.853 --> 00:21.521
Are they together?

00:27.610 --> 00:29.320
She was telling me
all this stuff,

00:29.362 --> 00:30.530
saying that she's not
happy with her boyfriend.

00:30.572 --> 00:32.741
Yeah, my exes cheated on me,

00:32.782 --> 00:35.243
but I guess it's not
right to cheat back.

00:39.539 --> 00:44.169
My ex is telling me we can make
this work, like, I forgive you.

00:45.962 --> 00:47.130
Charter number three.

00:47.172 --> 00:48.214
-We're sisters.
-We're sisters.

00:48.256 --> 00:49.591
We're cousins.

00:49.632 --> 00:50.967
Did you tell them
we're sisters, too?

00:51.009 --> 00:52.594
No?

00:54.346 --> 00:55.889
My tooth is, like,
really killing me.

00:55.930 --> 00:57.640
Can I be in housekeeping
tonight, just for tonight?

00:57.682 --> 00:58.850
-Yeah, 100 percent.
-So you can do service?

00:58.892 --> 01:00.060
Yeah.

01:00.101 --> 01:01.728
Everybody knows
that I let Raygan go.

01:01.770 --> 01:05.398
But for now, Storm is stepping
in as the provisional bosun.

01:05.440 --> 01:07.359
It's been a dream of mine,
to obviously become a bosun.

01:07.400 --> 01:09.527
What I'm gonna do is show Sandy,

01:09.569 --> 01:11.654
you know, that she made
the right decision.

01:11.696 --> 01:12.989
Here we go.

01:13.031 --> 01:14.741
Starboard quarter
[garbled radio chatter] stern.

01:14.783 --> 01:16.117
I don't hear Storm.

01:16.159 --> 01:19.621
Three meters to V4 off your
[garbled radio chatter].

01:19.662 --> 01:22.916
Kick forward.
Kick forward.

01:22.957 --> 01:24.417
Storm, can't hear.

01:24.459 --> 01:26.753
Two meters to V4
[garbled radio chatter] quarter.

01:26.795 --> 01:30.173
And Storm, again,
press your mic and then talk.

01:30.215 --> 01:31.966
Ugh!
We're gonna hit.

01:32.008 --> 01:35.845
One meter... oh.

01:41.351 --> 01:44.270
We are touching V4 on the
starboard quarter.

01:48.024 --> 01:50.860
Did we damage the vessel?

01:50.902 --> 01:52.737
No.

01:52.779 --> 01:55.365
You're three meters off
your starboard bow

01:55.407 --> 01:56.700
[garbled radio chatter]

01:59.536 --> 02:00.870
They're not going through?

02:00.912 --> 02:01.913
Why, dude?

02:01.955 --> 02:04.249
Press your mic and then talk.

02:04.290 --> 02:05.625
I do not hear your meters.

02:05.667 --> 02:07.877
Copy that...
apologies, Captain.

02:07.919 --> 02:12.298
Your V4 is three meters off
your starboard bow.

02:12.340 --> 02:17.303
Thirteen meters off your
starboard quarter to V6.

02:17.345 --> 02:19.931
Stern is clear,
stern is clear.

02:19.973 --> 02:21.141
Thank you, Storm.

02:21.182 --> 02:22.142
Are we good to go fenders?

02:22.183 --> 02:23.351
Yeah.

02:31.860 --> 02:33.862
I was just drooling blood
the whole of last night.

02:33.903 --> 02:35.739
-Oh, no.
-I know.

02:37.073 --> 02:39.534
Oh!

02:41.369 --> 02:42.912
Butter, butter.

02:54.632 --> 02:56.051
Okay, do you
wanna start deflating,

02:56.092 --> 02:57.135
and I'll go grab the others?

02:57.177 --> 02:58.345
Yep.

02:58.386 --> 03:01.306
Oh, my God, can
Kyle wake up already?

03:01.348 --> 03:04.392
[bleep] me.

03:04.434 --> 03:08.396
Storm, Mzi, you grabbing
the main deck fenders?

03:08.438 --> 03:10.190
<i>Yeah, all fenders</i>
<i>are on board.</i>

03:10.231 --> 03:12.233
Copy, thanks.

03:20.492 --> 03:21.743
How are you feeling?

03:21.785 --> 03:23.953
I'm exhausted,
but day heads are done,

03:23.995 --> 03:26.373
table set, orange juice
is done, water's done.

03:26.414 --> 03:28.041
So, behind the bar,
everything's done, but...

03:28.083 --> 03:29.125
Oh, you're waiting for Kyle?

03:29.167 --> 03:30.669
I think I'm gonna flip laundry.

03:30.710 --> 03:31.586
Yeah.

03:31.628 --> 03:33.380
-Hey, Storm.
-Hey, guys.

03:33.421 --> 03:36.675
You guys did fine, well done.

03:36.716 --> 03:39.761
-Storm, to the bridge.
<i>-Copy that, Captain.</i>

03:39.803 --> 03:41.221
You did well.

03:41.262 --> 03:43.306
No, I understand
where I went wrong.

03:43.348 --> 03:44.808
I was pressing this too early,

03:44.849 --> 03:46.768
which was obviously
frustrating for you, because...

03:46.810 --> 03:48.687
Okay, but I didn't go over that
with you, so you don't know.

03:48.728 --> 03:49.479
No.

03:49.521 --> 03:50.689
You gotta press and talk,

03:50.730 --> 03:51.690
because all I heard was,
you know, the...

03:51.731 --> 03:53.525
The last end of it, yeah.

03:53.566 --> 03:54.901
Yeah, and I know that's a
lot of pressure back there.

03:54.943 --> 03:57.529
Just relax and breathe.

03:57.570 --> 04:00.573
Before this charter season,
I've never hit anything.

04:00.615 --> 04:02.200
Now it's twice that it happened,

04:02.242 --> 04:03.952
but Storm is still
provisional...

04:03.993 --> 04:04.994
that's the difference.

04:05.036 --> 04:06.579
It's a teachable moment.

04:06.621 --> 04:09.040
But, you know, I need to make
sure he can do the job,

04:09.082 --> 04:10.458
that he can command his deck,

04:10.500 --> 04:13.128
organize it,
and run the deck team.

04:13.169 --> 04:15.046
Thanks, Cap.

04:15.088 --> 04:16.381
Service.

04:17.799 --> 04:18.883
Kyle.

04:20.135 --> 04:21.720
Come on, get to work.

04:21.761 --> 04:22.929
Did you have a good night?

04:22.971 --> 04:27.017
Yes, definitely
a birthday to remember.

04:27.058 --> 04:29.102
You all looked fabulous.

04:29.144 --> 04:30.812
We don't feel fabulous, though.

04:30.854 --> 04:32.022
Aw.

04:32.063 --> 04:33.273
Honestly, your hair
actually looks better

04:33.314 --> 04:34.315
now that you've got that on.

04:34.357 --> 04:35.775
-Oh.
-Seriously.

04:35.817 --> 04:37.819
How's been your
two days of vacation?

04:37.861 --> 04:39.612
Are you feeling
fresh after that?

04:39.654 --> 04:41.072
I need to take over
the laundry.

04:41.114 --> 04:43.033
Good luck, I'm so excited
to see Mt. Everest

04:43.074 --> 04:44.367
at 12:00 at night.

04:44.409 --> 04:45.660
[sighs]

04:45.702 --> 04:47.037
You know what you wanna
do with the lines?

04:47.078 --> 04:49.414
Just gonna tie them up
and put them down.

04:49.456 --> 04:50.707
Okay.

04:53.960 --> 04:55.754
I know that Mzi would never,
like, judge me

04:55.795 --> 04:56.796
if I was sh-- or whatever.

04:56.838 --> 04:58.340
But I just kinda wanna be good.

04:58.381 --> 05:01.384
Like, I wanna kinda show him
that I am a good deckhand.

05:01.426 --> 05:03.011
One more.

05:03.053 --> 05:05.055
And also, like, I wanna do,
like, Captain Sandy proud.

05:05.096 --> 05:07.265
Like, she doesn't know if I'm
a good deckhand or not.

05:07.307 --> 05:10.226
She's just hoping that I am.

05:10.268 --> 05:12.354
She's got some
weird faith in me.

05:12.395 --> 05:14.814
Ee, not a vibe.

05:20.111 --> 05:22.238
Seeing as you've only worked
a quarter of this charter,

05:22.280 --> 05:25.533
you will only take a quarter of
what is gonna be your tip money.

05:32.457 --> 05:34.417
Nat, just shut the [bleep] up.

05:41.174 --> 05:42.759
Anchor down.

05:42.801 --> 05:43.927
Copy, Cap.

05:46.554 --> 05:48.682
Anchor is up and down,
up and down, no tension.

05:48.723 --> 05:50.934
<i>Okay, terrific.</i>
<i>Anchor ball up.</i>

05:50.975 --> 05:53.895
Deck crew, deck crew,
be ready to do water sports.

05:53.937 --> 05:55.188
Copy.

05:55.230 --> 05:57.232
Ah-ha!

05:57.273 --> 05:58.233
Was that a yawn?

05:58.274 --> 06:00.151
Yeehaw.

06:00.193 --> 06:01.903
It's so beautiful out.

06:04.781 --> 06:05.949
You still getting
ready for work?

06:05.990 --> 06:08.743
Can I have
two seconds to myself,

06:08.785 --> 06:10.453
and you can shut your face?

06:10.495 --> 06:12.539
-That would be fantastic.
-You've had the last 24 hours.

06:12.580 --> 06:15.250
I'm up, in massive pain,
working my ass,

06:15.291 --> 06:17.752
because I can't let you and
Tash down, and then I asked,

06:17.794 --> 06:19.045
listen, do you mind being
in service and

06:19.087 --> 06:20.714
you're up in the
housekeeping again.

06:22.132 --> 06:23.299
-Thank you so much.
-Did you sleep okay?

06:23.341 --> 06:24.718
I did.

06:24.759 --> 06:26.219
This morning, you've
only just gotten up.

06:26.261 --> 06:27.429
I've set the table,
the orange juice is done,

06:27.470 --> 06:28.722
the pantry's clear...

06:28.763 --> 06:30.348
You're not supposed to be here.
Like--

06:30.390 --> 06:31.558
What do you want me to do
stand there and have a coffee

06:31.599 --> 06:33.351
with my hands crossed?

06:33.393 --> 06:35.228
That's right, I wanna do this,
because I don't want you...

06:35.270 --> 06:36.813
-I'm helping you turn over.
-And I appreciate that so much,

06:36.855 --> 06:37.814
but I don't want you
to do extra work.

06:37.856 --> 06:39.691
Well, clearly ----ing not.

06:39.733 --> 06:41.026
Just understand, I don't
wanna be in front of the guests

06:41.067 --> 06:42.360
with a gaping ----ing
tooth and in pain.

06:42.402 --> 06:43.653
It's a sensitive topic.

06:43.695 --> 06:44.863
Like, I've been sh-- on
so many times

06:44.904 --> 06:46.489
because I leave work
for two seconds.

06:46.531 --> 06:47.574
Kyle, I've never worked
with you in the past,

06:47.615 --> 06:48.867
so how am I supposed to know

06:48.908 --> 06:50.744
that you get offense
about this stuff?

06:50.785 --> 06:52.579
Well, basically, I'm honestly
saying I'm apologizing

06:52.620 --> 06:55.790
for the dig that
I was pushed into.

06:55.832 --> 06:57.625
So, I said, when
I was up there...

06:57.667 --> 06:58.710
Kyle, this is
literally going nowhere.

06:58.752 --> 07:00.253
I'm actually getting pissed off.

07:00.295 --> 07:02.672
Oh, my ----ing God.

07:03.465 --> 07:04.758
Yeah.

07:04.799 --> 07:06.259
And I said, can I be
in ----ing laundry.

07:06.301 --> 07:09.012
Where is she again?

07:09.054 --> 07:11.931
There you go... housekeeping,
laundry, yours, go on.

07:14.517 --> 07:15.935
Oh, what's the...

07:15.977 --> 07:18.104
he's starting stuff out
of absolutely nothing.

07:18.146 --> 07:19.981
I'm bringing up valid topics,
it's not absolutely anything.

07:20.023 --> 07:21.900
Well, do you wanna hang
in laundry or what?

07:23.026 --> 07:25.320
So-and-so said this,
so-and-so said that.

07:25.362 --> 07:26.780
I feel like a schoolteacher.

07:26.821 --> 07:28.531
Like, listen, guys.

07:28.573 --> 07:30.825
You cannot afford
to not get along.

07:30.867 --> 07:33.495
It's going to affect your work.

07:33.536 --> 07:34.871
You always get defensive when

07:34.913 --> 07:36.498
you know you're actually
----ing wrong.

07:36.539 --> 07:40.585
How am I not wrong?

07:40.627 --> 07:41.836
Great.

07:41.878 --> 07:43.797
I don't want you
to have a bad vibe.

07:43.838 --> 07:45.465
Neither do I; hence,
I apologized.

07:45.507 --> 07:47.092
She just didn't
----ing take it.

07:47.133 --> 07:49.094
Mzi, your method last
time worked out well.

07:49.135 --> 07:50.804
-Yeah.
-If you wanna replicate it?

07:50.845 --> 07:53.014
Mzi's got this
thing on lockdown.

07:53.056 --> 07:55.392
Should we just try it with one,
and see how it works?

07:55.433 --> 07:57.060
With just the one what?

07:57.102 --> 07:58.561
-So, we'll just put...
-One of these.

07:58.603 --> 07:59.604
...one NautiBuoy out, not both.

07:59.646 --> 08:01.064
Yeah.

08:01.106 --> 08:02.732
<i>Courtney, Courtney,</i>
<i>to the bow, please.</i>

08:02.774 --> 08:05.694
<i>On my way, Storm.</i>

08:05.735 --> 08:07.445
Oh, lookit, the floating raft.

08:07.487 --> 08:09.531
-Jetski time?
-Yes, ma'am.

08:09.572 --> 08:10.782
Yeehaw!

08:10.824 --> 08:12.367
Gonna jump on the top?

08:12.409 --> 08:13.368
Yee...

08:13.410 --> 08:15.286
[grunts]

08:16.371 --> 08:17.747
Hot dang.

08:17.789 --> 08:20.208
Courtney, is the water warm?

08:22.752 --> 08:24.713
You look like a mermaid.

08:26.715 --> 08:28.091
If you guys can all jump
in the banana,

08:28.133 --> 08:29.843
I'll take you for
a slow little cruise.

08:29.884 --> 08:31.553
-Yeah?
-Yeah!

08:36.349 --> 08:38.560
All right, ladies, ready?

08:43.314 --> 08:44.941
Woo!

08:46.901 --> 08:49.237
Yay, they're having fun.

08:49.279 --> 08:51.239
-Yeah!
-Woo!

08:59.414 --> 09:01.041
What's that?

09:03.084 --> 09:05.003
Getting back together
with my ex,

09:05.045 --> 09:09.549
I feel like Dave
is going to be upset.

09:09.591 --> 09:11.301
I don't know
what he's gonna say.

09:11.343 --> 09:13.219
He's just so unpredictable.

09:13.261 --> 09:15.347
I don't know what
runs through Dave's head

09:15.388 --> 09:16.931
at the best of times.

09:19.934 --> 09:21.186
That was super fun.

09:21.227 --> 09:22.896
I'm not gonna lie,
I was jealous.

09:22.937 --> 09:25.023
You guys looked like you guys
were having a blast.

09:29.110 --> 09:31.071
It's so painful.

09:32.364 --> 09:33.990
I don't know where this
wind's coming from.

09:34.032 --> 09:36.242
It's not on
the weather forecast.

09:36.284 --> 09:39.329
<i>Deck crew, deck crew, we're,</i>
<i>like, getting 20 knots of wind,</i>

09:39.371 --> 09:41.706
<i>so you can get the toys</i>
<i>on the swim platform.</i>

09:41.748 --> 09:42.874
<i>Copy, copy.</i>

09:42.916 --> 09:44.417
-All right, guys...
-Yeah.

09:44.459 --> 09:47.003
who's rode a jet-ski
in rough waters before?

09:47.045 --> 09:49.547
-I haven't done it before, no.
-I've done it before.

09:49.589 --> 09:50.799
I was in swell on my last boat.

09:50.840 --> 09:54.344
Might sh-- my pants,
but I'll do it.

09:54.386 --> 09:55.387
Believe in you!

09:55.428 --> 09:57.806
Hah... last time I did this,

09:57.847 --> 10:00.058
I got smacked in
the face by a crane.

10:00.100 --> 10:01.267
Oh, serious?

10:01.309 --> 10:02.602
Yeah, I had, like, a
big bruise down my face

10:02.644 --> 10:04.813
for about three days.

10:04.854 --> 10:06.815
Trying to hook jet-skis back up
to the crane and stuff,

10:06.856 --> 10:10.110
it's hard anyway,
and when there's swell,

10:10.151 --> 10:11.820
it just makes it
a lot more dangerous.

10:14.823 --> 10:18.827
Rapido, rapido,
the wind's, like, 20 knots.

10:18.868 --> 10:20.704
Slow yourself down.

10:22.372 --> 10:23.415
Grab hold of it.

10:28.753 --> 10:29.963
Mind your head...

10:30.005 --> 10:31.297
you're gonna do it.

10:32.841 --> 10:36.302
There we go, great job.

10:36.344 --> 10:37.762
Good job!

10:37.804 --> 10:39.389
Thank God.

10:39.431 --> 10:41.016
Pull, Mzi, pull, pull, pull.

10:41.057 --> 10:42.851
Pull your tension,
pull your tension.

10:42.892 --> 10:45.770
Seriously, this wind.

10:45.812 --> 10:47.897
We're going up.

10:47.939 --> 10:50.025
Okay, boys, listen,
it's very, very windy.

10:50.066 --> 10:54.320
This is gonna be moving a lot.
I'm going this way around.

10:54.362 --> 10:55.739
That's it.

10:57.365 --> 10:59.784
Can you guys confirm that
all toys are out the water?

10:59.826 --> 11:01.036
Yeah, that's the last one in.

11:01.077 --> 11:02.912
We're just putting
the railings in.

11:02.954 --> 11:04.831
Thank you, guys.

11:04.873 --> 11:06.374
<i>Nice work.</i>

11:06.416 --> 11:09.252
-Oh, my God.
-Ooh!

11:09.294 --> 11:10.337
As we rock.

11:10.378 --> 11:11.629
Swell coming now.

11:11.671 --> 11:14.007
Bloody boat.
Oh, Christ.

11:19.220 --> 11:21.848
[alarm blares]

11:21.890 --> 11:23.933
Carlos, I can't
get the stabilizers on,

11:23.975 --> 11:25.435
I can't get the stabilizers on.

11:25.477 --> 11:28.730
Oh [bleep] not this again.

11:29.856 --> 11:32.484
Whoa... whoa!

11:32.525 --> 11:33.693
Everybody hold on.

11:33.735 --> 11:35.362
Oh, God.

11:35.403 --> 11:37.030
Coffee machine!

11:37.072 --> 11:38.531
Hang on, everybody.

11:38.573 --> 11:40.784
The ----ing boat's gonna roll.

11:40.825 --> 11:42.869
Hang on, hang on.

11:42.911 --> 11:44.621
-Whoa!
-Jesus.

11:44.662 --> 11:46.706
----ing nightmare.

11:46.748 --> 11:48.249
Oh, God.

11:55.924 --> 11:56.883
Carlos, I can't
get the stabilizers on,

11:58.218 --> 12:00.470
I can't get the stabilizers on.

12:00.512 --> 12:02.931
Oh, my God.

12:02.972 --> 12:05.642
Hang on, everybody, this
----ing boat's gonna roll.

12:05.684 --> 12:07.811
<i>So, just hang on, hang on.</i>

12:13.483 --> 12:15.819
Could someone please
find the engineer for me?

12:17.404 --> 12:19.072
Oh, God.

12:21.658 --> 12:24.202
It's a little unstable.

12:28.790 --> 12:29.833
Grab that glass,
grab that glass!

12:29.874 --> 12:31.543
It's gonna fall.

12:31.584 --> 12:33.586
<i>If these stabilizers</i>
<i>aren't fixed in five minutes,</i>

12:33.628 --> 12:35.088
<i>anchor's up.</i>

12:40.677 --> 12:41.803
Yeah.
It's on.

12:41.845 --> 12:42.804
<i>Okay.</i>

12:42.846 --> 12:43.805
Are you guys all right?

12:43.847 --> 12:45.181
Yeah.

12:45.223 --> 12:47.767
It's all good up here, isn't it?

12:47.809 --> 12:49.936
The cooling alarm went off.

12:49.978 --> 12:51.187
That's when I started
losing the stabilizers.

12:51.229 --> 12:52.605
Yeah.

12:54.107 --> 12:55.817
-The cooling mode...
-Yeah.

12:55.859 --> 12:57.485
-Is that what this is?
-Mm-hmm.

12:57.527 --> 13:00.488
So, air conditioning is
taking a big part of it.

13:00.530 --> 13:02.240
So, we gotta keep
the doors closed.

13:02.282 --> 13:03.366
Yeah.

13:03.408 --> 13:05.827
<i>All crew, from now on,</i>
<i>doors closed.</i>

13:05.869 --> 13:07.245
Roger that.

13:14.586 --> 13:16.171
You all right?

13:16.212 --> 13:17.172
I was coming to check on you,
see if you were all right.

13:17.213 --> 13:18.840
Oh, no, I was good.

13:18.882 --> 13:20.258
<i>All crew, all crew,</i>
<i>we're going back to the port.</i>

13:20.300 --> 13:21.718
<i>-Sh--.</i>
<i>-Copy that.</i>

13:21.760 --> 13:23.595
We're gonna head
back to the dock.

13:23.636 --> 13:24.679
That sounds like a good plan.

13:24.721 --> 13:25.805
Thank you for letting me know.

13:25.847 --> 13:27.349
Okay, no worries.

13:27.390 --> 13:28.933
Stresses me out.

13:28.975 --> 13:32.520
Even though the stabilizers are
working, these swells are big.

13:32.562 --> 13:35.523
I never want the guests to get
sick, but also it's not safe.

13:35.565 --> 13:38.443
So, my decision-making
is based on safety.

13:38.485 --> 13:41.988
Hey, Cap, are we going
alongside or stern-to?

13:42.030 --> 13:44.491
-Stern-to.
-Copy that.

13:47.285 --> 13:49.371
Well, now, I don't know
what I'm doing right now.

13:51.414 --> 13:53.583
What?

13:53.625 --> 13:57.379
I think it's, like, cooked in,
like, a soy type sauce.

13:57.420 --> 14:00.298
Why don't you come do this, and
I'll make cocktails tonight.

14:00.340 --> 14:01.883
Sorry, I'm trying to
give you some inspo.

14:01.925 --> 14:04.219
All right, thanks.

14:04.260 --> 14:07.555
Oh, Lord, my teeth
----ing in again.

14:07.597 --> 14:10.016
<i>-Anchor up, anchor up.</i>
-Copy that.

14:14.396 --> 14:16.064
Oh!

14:16.106 --> 14:18.233
Anchor is at waterline,
it's coming home.

14:22.028 --> 14:23.196
<i>Copy that.</i>

14:23.238 --> 14:25.115
Shall I just get
this little top bit?

14:25.156 --> 14:27.200
-It's just the tip, though.
-Just the tip.

14:29.703 --> 14:31.037
No?
Not find it funny?

14:31.079 --> 14:32.414
-Okay.
-No, I'm just, like...

14:32.455 --> 14:33.748
Tough crowd!

14:33.790 --> 14:36.584
I'm happy with the fact
that Courtney's here.

14:36.626 --> 14:38.586
She brings a lot of flair,

14:38.628 --> 14:41.131
and she just has such a good
energy and aura about her.

14:41.172 --> 14:44.092
Whereas Jason can be,
like, relatively monotone,

14:44.134 --> 14:45.677
and sort of doing his own thing.

14:45.719 --> 14:47.470
So, I think Courtney's energy
is just gonna bring

14:47.512 --> 14:49.222
a whole different dynamic
to the team.

14:49.264 --> 14:52.017
It's got a boner.

14:52.058 --> 14:54.436
-Moving, driving.
-Moving.

14:54.477 --> 14:55.979
We're yachting.

15:00.233 --> 15:02.193
Can I Google
what the hell is this?

15:02.235 --> 15:03.778
What is it called, '70s...

15:03.820 --> 15:05.238
54.

15:05.280 --> 15:07.282
The group would like to
have a decadent night by...

15:07.323 --> 15:09.701
-Yes!
-throwing a Studio 54 party.

15:09.743 --> 15:11.619
I'm doing the table,
and you're doing this on deck?

15:11.661 --> 15:13.663
-Yeah.
-Okay.

15:26.676 --> 15:29.262
Get yourself heaving lines,
and get yourself stoppers.

15:29.304 --> 15:30.638
-Yeah.
-Yeah?

15:30.680 --> 15:32.223
-Hello?
-So cute!

15:32.265 --> 15:34.642
-It's kinda Studio 54ish.
-It's Studio 54, dude.

15:34.684 --> 15:37.187
Mmm, hmm, hmm.

15:39.397 --> 15:41.191
Are we setting up lines
and blowing up fenders?

15:41.232 --> 15:43.860
Yeah, we're going stern-to.

15:43.902 --> 15:46.154
I'm here to partay.

15:50.784 --> 15:52.202
You are ----ing kidding.

15:56.039 --> 15:57.165
----ing unbelievable.

15:57.207 --> 15:59.292
Because I can't see sh--.

15:59.334 --> 16:01.419
Storm, Storm,
please come to the bridge.

16:01.461 --> 16:03.171
I'm gonna be on the port side.

16:03.213 --> 16:05.507
Yes, copy, Captain, on the way.

16:05.548 --> 16:08.677
I'm definitely nervous, because
today we've hit a dolphin,

16:08.718 --> 16:11.680
and I did not expect my first
docking to be at night.

16:11.721 --> 16:15.016
I'm completely sh--ting myself,
because no one likes failure.

16:15.058 --> 16:16.685
I hate failure.

16:16.726 --> 16:17.977
Bow lines ready to go?

16:18.019 --> 16:18.978
-Bow lines are ready to go.
-Okay.

16:19.020 --> 16:20.647
Stern lines are ready to go.

16:20.689 --> 16:23.191
Yeah, I want one person on the
bow and the rest on the stern.

16:23.233 --> 16:25.193
All right, copy, Captain.

16:26.361 --> 16:28.363
<i>-Hey, Jason?</i>
-Yeah?

16:28.405 --> 16:29.864
<i>You're gonna have to be</i>
<i>alone on the bow.</i>

16:29.906 --> 16:30.990
Okay.

16:31.032 --> 16:32.867
<i>Sandy is on the port side,</i>

16:32.909 --> 16:35.036
so I need to give her
starboard readings.

16:35.078 --> 16:38.081
It's ----ing dark,
though, mate.

16:38.123 --> 16:40.000
Forty meters off
your starboard quarter.

16:40.041 --> 16:42.127
Jason, I can't see your hand,

16:42.168 --> 16:43.795
so you're gonna
have to stand up,

16:43.837 --> 16:45.714
because I can't see where
you're standing right now.

16:47.757 --> 16:49.384
-[bleep] me.
-Well...

16:49.426 --> 16:51.261
It's the second time
I've done this in my life.

16:52.387 --> 16:54.723
Storm, Storm,
is V3 to my starboard side

16:54.764 --> 16:56.307
or port side, over.

16:56.349 --> 16:58.059
V3 is to your starboard side.

16:58.101 --> 16:59.686
Great, thanks.

16:59.728 --> 17:01.563
Mzi, can you bring one fender
down to the stairs, just ready,

17:01.604 --> 17:03.690
just in case we
go into the dolphin?

17:06.067 --> 17:07.610
Three meters.

17:08.611 --> 17:09.654
Coming up...

17:09.696 --> 17:11.781
You all right, hon?

17:11.823 --> 17:15.201
Oh, babe, go and lie down.

17:15.243 --> 17:17.078
He's in so much pain.

17:28.381 --> 17:29.549
One meter off V3,
off your starboard quarter.

17:32.260 --> 17:33.636
You're clear.

17:33.678 --> 17:36.473
Great, Storm, now I need
to know am I center on

17:36.514 --> 17:39.267
where we're gonna be tying off.

17:39.309 --> 17:41.144
Kick to port, kick to port.

17:41.186 --> 17:43.146
Ten meters to the dock.

17:43.188 --> 17:46.149
-Okay, guys, throw.
-Yeah.

17:46.191 --> 17:47.650
Get it.

17:47.692 --> 17:50.070
<i>Seven meters off the dock.</i>

17:50.111 --> 17:52.364
<i>Five meters off the dock.</i>

17:54.199 --> 17:56.284
Good job, Jason.

17:57.202 --> 17:58.536
Are you gonna lock it off?

18:00.288 --> 18:01.498
Nice.

18:04.459 --> 18:05.627
We are good for the dock.

18:05.669 --> 18:07.504
You guys did an excellent job.

18:07.545 --> 18:09.089
We didn't hit anything!

18:09.130 --> 18:10.215
Deck team, baby!

18:10.256 --> 18:11.675
Yes.

18:11.716 --> 18:12.550
Thanks, ma'am.

18:12.592 --> 18:13.968
Did you just call her "mate?"

18:14.010 --> 18:15.970
I said "ma'am."

18:17.180 --> 18:19.224
Mm!

18:20.892 --> 18:22.727
We need to take
all the fenders back.

18:22.769 --> 18:23.978
Yeah.

18:25.563 --> 18:26.690
Good job on your lines, Court.

18:26.731 --> 18:28.108
Thank you.

18:28.149 --> 18:31.277
Mzi, you also smashed it,
homie, thank you so much.

18:31.319 --> 18:32.278
How do you feel?

18:32.320 --> 18:33.905
Relieved.

18:42.372 --> 18:45.250
Are you all right, hon?

18:46.251 --> 18:48.753
Oh, babe, go and lie down.

18:50.005 --> 18:51.548
<i>Storm, Tasha.</i>

18:51.589 --> 18:53.049
<i>I don't suppose</i>
<i>we've got anyone available</i>

18:53.091 --> 18:55.135
<i>to help us with the interior?</i>

18:55.176 --> 18:57.095
<i>If you give us about</i>
<i>maybe 20 minutes,</i>

18:57.137 --> 18:58.596
<i>we'll be able to help you.</i>

19:00.265 --> 19:01.474
What's going on?

19:01.516 --> 19:04.477
I'm so...
I'm happy to help.

19:04.519 --> 19:07.105
No, you're all right, hon.

19:07.147 --> 19:08.565
I still have feelings for her,

19:08.606 --> 19:11.985
obviously, which I can't
remove or run away from.

19:12.027 --> 19:13.445
I kind of not boxed it up.

19:13.486 --> 19:15.363
Like, I still enjoy
being around her,

19:15.405 --> 19:16.573
and I still enjoy her presence.

19:16.614 --> 19:17.907
But I'm not gonna make it harder

19:17.949 --> 19:19.576
for us to work
as a team, either.

19:19.617 --> 19:20.994
But I don't know how to act.

19:21.036 --> 19:23.246
It's just all a bit weird.

19:23.288 --> 19:25.498
Okay, I'm good now.

19:39.304 --> 19:41.097
Okay, so, what's
gonna happen

19:41.139 --> 19:43.141
is we're gonna clean up
the deck, put the lines away.

19:43.183 --> 19:45.268
Court is gonna break from us
and go join the interior.

19:45.310 --> 19:46.728
Thank you so much again.

19:46.770 --> 19:48.605
Like, I hate the fact that
you have come to deck

19:48.646 --> 19:50.023
and now you're getting
pulled back.

19:50.065 --> 19:52.108
Yeah, yeah.
I'm happy to help in interior.

19:52.150 --> 19:53.401
Like, I understand...

19:53.443 --> 19:56.363
obviously, I understand,
I've been there.

19:56.404 --> 19:59.783
If I was a crib,
how would I be put up?

19:59.824 --> 20:02.202
Is anybody available to
help me with this crib?

20:02.243 --> 20:04.162
Just stand on the bottom to
keep it on the floor...

20:04.204 --> 20:05.413
we have crib.

20:05.455 --> 20:07.499
Oh, my God, you're
real-life daddy!

20:07.540 --> 20:09.668
But at the same time,
I want to be, like,

20:09.709 --> 20:11.795
moving forward and
progressing on deck.

20:11.836 --> 20:13.129
But it's fine.

20:13.171 --> 20:14.547
Everything's fine.

20:14.589 --> 20:17.967
-But yeah, thank you so much.
-Yeah.

20:19.094 --> 20:20.553
<i>Sandy, Sandy, Tasha.</i>

20:20.595 --> 20:22.764
<i>Can you meet me in the pantry?</i>

20:22.806 --> 20:24.140
On my way.

20:24.182 --> 20:26.643
I'm so excited to see what
Chef Dave's making us.

20:26.685 --> 20:29.062
I know, I mean, I've had
Thai food, so what's different?

20:29.104 --> 20:31.856
You guys, the table is amazing.

20:36.695 --> 20:37.821
He's in so much pain.

20:37.862 --> 20:38.822
Why?

20:38.863 --> 20:40.532
His back tooth and
everything.

20:40.573 --> 20:42.033
I'll check on him.

20:45.745 --> 20:47.497
Hi, hon.

20:47.539 --> 20:49.040
Hi, so, it's just me and
you on service now.

20:49.082 --> 20:50.083
-Yeah.
-Storm, Nat.

20:50.125 --> 20:51.710
<i>Yes, Nat?</i>

20:51.751 --> 20:55.422
Hi, are you able to bring up
a rag with you to the sundeck?

20:55.463 --> 20:56.631
Copy that.

20:56.673 --> 20:58.174
You're doing double duty.

20:58.216 --> 21:00.635
You were a deckhand,
and now you're doing this.

21:00.677 --> 21:02.595
I know, I meant to be
a deckhand, and...

21:02.637 --> 21:03.680
You are a stud on the deck.

21:03.722 --> 21:05.181
Yeah, you are a swimmer.

21:05.223 --> 21:07.017
-Aw, thanks.
-Yeah!

21:07.058 --> 21:09.853
My brother says I swim
really bad, so I'll tell him.

21:14.107 --> 21:15.525
Kyle?

21:15.567 --> 21:17.027
How are you feeling?

21:17.068 --> 21:18.111
I have an infection.

21:18.153 --> 21:19.404
It's so sore.

21:19.446 --> 21:22.240
Yeah, that's the worst pain.

21:22.282 --> 21:23.950
Every day, it's, like,

21:23.992 --> 21:26.286
literally paining so much
on the side here.

21:26.327 --> 21:28.455
You need to see the dentist.

21:28.496 --> 21:30.707
Go lie down.

21:30.749 --> 21:33.209
Are you going to the same
place for Thanksgiving?

21:33.251 --> 21:34.669
Yeah, we're doing Cabo.

21:34.711 --> 21:35.670
Are you gonna do
just the two families,

21:35.712 --> 21:36.880
or do you have mom, too?

21:36.921 --> 21:38.965
Our mom was going to,
but now is not.

21:39.007 --> 21:40.717
We try and get her to go,
but she never wants to go.

21:40.759 --> 21:42.385
-Why?
-She hates us.

21:42.427 --> 21:44.137
[laughing]

21:46.848 --> 21:48.266
I'm a little bit stressed
out right now.

21:48.308 --> 21:52.062
-Want to clear the...
-Every single glass is...

21:52.103 --> 21:53.438
Oh my gosh.

21:56.566 --> 21:58.985
Are you okay?

21:59.027 --> 22:00.779
Hi, Dr. Tea.

22:00.820 --> 22:02.697
I actually have a crewmember,
he's in severe pain,

22:02.739 --> 22:05.283
and his tooth... okay.

22:05.325 --> 22:08.370
So, I'm thinking maybe
he should go to the hospital?

22:08.411 --> 22:10.538
Thank you very much.

22:10.580 --> 22:12.040
All right, bye-bye.

22:12.082 --> 22:13.833
What's on my head?

22:16.127 --> 22:17.295
[knocking]

22:17.337 --> 22:19.172
-Kyle?
-Yes, Cap?

22:19.214 --> 22:21.132
Hey.

22:23.176 --> 22:24.427
Okay, thank you, Cap.

22:24.469 --> 22:25.428
-I'll be up.
-You're welcome.

22:25.470 --> 22:27.138
Okay.

22:31.685 --> 22:34.270
Okay, so they're good to go.

22:34.312 --> 22:35.480
Okay, are we ready?

22:35.522 --> 22:36.981
Let's ----ing go guys.

22:37.023 --> 22:39.067
Oh, this soy things
looks amazing.

22:41.486 --> 22:43.446
Ooh!

22:43.488 --> 22:44.447
Wow.

22:44.489 --> 22:45.448
Oh, my gosh.

22:45.490 --> 22:46.950
It smells amazing.

22:46.991 --> 22:49.119
It's called morning glory,
inspired by Tash.

22:49.160 --> 22:51.579
And then the octopus,
I've cooked it three times,

22:51.621 --> 22:53.707
so it should be super tender.

22:53.748 --> 22:54.958
-Great.
-Looks amazing.

22:55.000 --> 22:56.126
Thank you.

22:56.167 --> 22:57.627
It's my favorite dish,
I'm sure.

22:57.669 --> 22:58.628
-I hope you enjoy it, guys.
-Thank you!

22:58.670 --> 23:00.088
-Wow.
-Enjoy.

23:00.130 --> 23:01.339
It's unbelievable.
This looks beautiful.

23:01.381 --> 23:02.590
-Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.
-Very good.

23:02.632 --> 23:04.551
So delicious.

23:04.592 --> 23:07.262
-Where you going?
-To hospital, babe.

23:07.303 --> 23:09.014
Good luck, my love.

23:09.055 --> 23:09.848
Thank you.

23:09.889 --> 23:11.891
You'll be all right, hey?

23:17.647 --> 23:19.065
I don't wanna let my team down.

23:19.107 --> 23:20.942
Losing one person
could be detrimental

23:20.984 --> 23:22.610
for the interior crew, you know?

23:22.652 --> 23:25.113
But it's literally
throbbing into my skull.

23:25.155 --> 23:27.657
It feels like being
punched in the face

23:27.699 --> 23:29.993
by a professional boxer,
I would say.

23:30.035 --> 23:31.828
Yeah, no, I'd rather just
have had that.

23:35.165 --> 23:36.541
Coming up...

23:38.835 --> 23:41.963
This whole Dave situation
is quite awkward.

23:42.005 --> 23:43.757
But that's the
thing about boats,

23:56.811 --> 23:58.104
Oh, God.

24:00.648 --> 24:02.525
-Court?
-Yeah?

24:02.567 --> 24:04.152
I'm just gonna need
a hand clearing.

24:04.194 --> 24:05.445
Yeah, no worries.

24:05.487 --> 24:06.988
-Give us a kiss?
-No.

24:07.030 --> 24:09.449
Give us a kiss?
Give us a kiss?

24:09.491 --> 24:11.826
-Dave?
-Yeah.

24:11.868 --> 24:13.953
What's the plan with
the dessert just now?

24:13.995 --> 24:15.663
Do you wanna come up
and announce it, or...

24:15.705 --> 24:17.207
Yeah.

24:17.248 --> 24:20.001
-The octopus was really good.
-It was outta control.

24:20.043 --> 24:22.796
That octopus was amazing.

24:24.964 --> 24:27.133
For the dessert this evening,
Dave's going to explain.

24:27.175 --> 24:29.844
So, basically, it's a...
I call it a false apple.

24:29.886 --> 24:31.554
It's a chocolate ganache,
it's super rich.

24:31.596 --> 24:32.972
What?

24:33.014 --> 24:35.433
And then inside of it is a
banana-and-caramel core.

24:35.475 --> 24:36.768
So, it's all edible.

24:36.810 --> 24:38.395
-It's super rich.
-Oh, wow.

24:38.436 --> 24:39.396
This looks amazing.

24:39.437 --> 24:40.397
-Wow.
-Oh, wow.

24:40.438 --> 24:41.439
Thank you so much for having me.

24:41.481 --> 24:42.440
Thank you!

24:42.482 --> 24:46.361
Oh, my gosh, it's so good.

24:50.990 --> 24:53.451
I've definitely been
through way worse

24:53.493 --> 24:55.995
than this whole Dave situation.

24:56.037 --> 25:00.542
I was engaged to somebody
that I worked with on a boat.

25:00.583 --> 25:02.002
We'd been together three years,

25:02.043 --> 25:04.504
we were engaged
for a year and a half.

25:04.546 --> 25:06.131
I broke up with him, actually,

25:06.172 --> 25:08.883
when we were crossing
from Mallorca to Abu Dhabi.

25:08.925 --> 25:10.719
He clearly loved me a lot,

25:10.760 --> 25:13.555
and I still loved him,
but not in that way.

25:13.596 --> 25:18.643
We had to continue sharing
a cabin for almost a month.

25:18.685 --> 25:21.187
That was quite awkward and hard.

25:21.229 --> 25:23.023
But that's
the thing about boats...

25:23.064 --> 25:24.399
you've got nowhere
to run and hide.

25:24.441 --> 25:26.401
You just have to deal
with things face-on.

25:31.197 --> 25:32.407
Thanks, boys.

25:40.915 --> 25:44.878
You look like
you've been through a tornado.

25:44.919 --> 25:46.504
Okay, we'll meet
you at the club.

25:46.546 --> 25:48.548
-Studio 54.
-Yeah!

25:48.590 --> 25:51.009
I feel like the lighting and the
background and everything...

25:51.051 --> 25:54.012
-Yeah, everything is...
-Yeah, super shiny and cute.

25:54.054 --> 25:56.348
Do a shot with your sister.

25:56.389 --> 25:57.682
Wow, yum, yum, yum.

25:57.724 --> 25:59.559
More alcohol.

25:59.601 --> 26:01.186
I'm actually exhausted.

26:01.227 --> 26:02.854
Things just got very stressful
towards the end of today.

26:02.896 --> 26:06.399
Drink it down.

26:06.441 --> 26:08.902
Basically the way we're gonna
set up in the future,

26:08.943 --> 26:11.488
we'll have the usual,
like, foil Seabobs,

26:11.529 --> 26:14.908
and just the hot dog, because
we're getting more toys.

26:14.949 --> 26:16.201
Wait, this is all for tomorrow?

26:16.242 --> 26:17.744
No, no, no,
so for future reference.

26:17.786 --> 26:20.080
-Oh, oh, oh. Okay.
-Yeah.

26:20.121 --> 26:22.874
We're getting to a place on
deck where things

26:22.916 --> 26:24.584
are starting to sort
of take shape.

26:24.626 --> 26:28.296
But I really wanna step up
into setting up a system

26:28.338 --> 26:29.714
to get a better
structure in place.

26:29.756 --> 26:31.591
The Seabobs aren't on charge.

26:31.633 --> 26:34.928
I know, because I just
put them in there earlier.

26:34.969 --> 26:37.305
Growing up, I had to do,
like, dishes after dinner,

26:37.347 --> 26:40.058
and I had to, like,
books on holidays,

26:40.100 --> 26:42.060
and I think that's
why structure's always been

26:42.102 --> 26:43.561
so important to me,
just because

26:43.603 --> 26:45.480
in order to have progress,
you need structure.

26:45.522 --> 26:48.441
And it will just make us
a lot more efficient.

26:48.483 --> 26:50.443
This heat.

26:50.485 --> 26:51.778
Whoa!

26:51.820 --> 26:54.239
[shouting]

26:54.280 --> 26:55.573
Yeah!

26:55.615 --> 26:57.742
That's the running man!

26:57.784 --> 27:00.370
From 1985.

27:01.830 --> 27:04.082
Oh, my God, Gina's flexible.

27:04.124 --> 27:07.168
-Okay.
-Yes!

27:11.756 --> 27:15.093
To the pub, yeah, pub
across the road, then club.

27:15.135 --> 27:16.261
Whoa.

27:16.302 --> 27:17.429
Then twerk.

27:17.470 --> 27:18.930
Oh, yeah.

27:18.972 --> 27:20.682
Oh, God, you're
bringing us water?

27:20.724 --> 27:22.350
That's not a good sign.

27:22.392 --> 27:24.602
I need to wear a
good twerking outfit.

27:24.644 --> 27:26.730
-Going to bed.
-Good night.

27:26.771 --> 27:27.897
I've been practicing.

27:27.939 --> 27:30.734
In quarantine, just like...

27:30.775 --> 27:32.402
-Good night, thank you.
-Good night.

27:34.696 --> 27:36.740
-Okay, I'm going to bed.
-Yeah.

27:36.781 --> 27:38.491
[bleep] it's 20 past 12:00.

27:42.495 --> 27:44.039
What's going on?

27:44.080 --> 27:46.750
What's going on with you?
How was your day?

27:46.791 --> 27:48.835
Oh, man, it's been a long day.

27:48.877 --> 27:50.295
I'm excited
to finish this charter.

27:50.337 --> 27:51.921
Yeah, it's been, like, good.

27:51.963 --> 27:53.423
We've had like the best guests.

27:53.465 --> 27:54.966
But it's just been, like,
the exhaustion, I think,

27:55.008 --> 27:56.343
because, like, we've lost Kyle.

27:56.384 --> 27:58.011
No, you crushed it.
Look at your sundeck.

28:00.847 --> 28:03.808
Well, I wanted to ask, tomorrow
night, if you're keen to...

28:03.850 --> 28:05.643
To do what?

28:05.685 --> 28:07.812
If you're keen to have a dinner,

28:07.854 --> 28:10.315
and then we'll go and
join the crew afterwards.

28:10.357 --> 28:12.317
Okay.

28:12.359 --> 28:14.152
It's not called a date, okay?

28:14.194 --> 28:16.529
Yeah, you're gonna
pay for it as well.

28:16.571 --> 28:18.323
Okay, thanks.

28:18.365 --> 28:19.991
Okay, I'll come.

28:20.033 --> 28:22.285
-What do you feel like?
-Getting drunk.

28:22.327 --> 28:24.621
Yeah, me too, but we have
to eat something, right?

28:24.662 --> 28:26.039
No, I'll find something sick.

28:26.081 --> 28:29.250
We're not planning a
bloody wedding, Christ.

28:29.292 --> 28:32.337
Ninety-nine percent of people
I've dated have cheated on me.

28:32.379 --> 28:34.839
So, now I'm just kinda like,
oh, there goes another one.

28:34.881 --> 28:36.341
Oh, you cheated on me?
Oh, great.

28:36.383 --> 28:38.927
But I'm hoping Storm
is different.

28:38.968 --> 28:41.221
It's hard to find
good people these days.

28:42.806 --> 28:44.349
Oh!

28:44.391 --> 28:47.602
I'll come give you a good
night kiss later, then.

28:47.644 --> 28:52.107
Coming up...

28:52.148 --> 28:53.942
You don't know what you want.

28:53.983 --> 28:55.026
What the [bleep] are you doing?

28:55.068 --> 28:56.611
This doesn't make sense.

28:56.653 --> 29:06.705
Because the only person that
actually gets hurt is you.

29:15.046 --> 29:15.547
What's up, honey?

29:16.214 --> 29:18.258
Oh, look at this.

29:18.299 --> 29:19.426
You got mad breakfast?

29:19.467 --> 29:20.760
Mm.

29:20.802 --> 29:24.014
So, you're the diangle...
diagonal diamond man.

29:24.055 --> 29:27.600
I tried to say "diagonal" and
"diamond" together, apparently.

29:29.269 --> 29:31.604
I'm more of a CZ kinda guy...

29:31.646 --> 29:33.690
cubic zirconium.

29:33.732 --> 29:35.316
It's a fake diamond.

29:38.486 --> 29:40.155
I'm not in sync with these guys.

29:40.196 --> 29:42.198
A lot of my jokes, they're
not landing, for sure.

29:42.240 --> 29:44.325
And then, like, Mzi's laughing

29:44.367 --> 29:46.286
at literally everything
Courtney says.

29:46.327 --> 29:48.246
-It's just the tip, though.
-Just the tip.

29:48.288 --> 29:50.415
No?
Not find it funny? Okay.

29:50.457 --> 29:52.709
-No, I'm just, like...
-Tough crowd!

29:52.751 --> 29:54.961
At this point, I'm actively
strategizing

29:55.003 --> 29:59.174
on how I can fit in, because
right now, I'm 100 percent not.

30:02.344 --> 30:07.682
-Oh, I'm alive.
-It's alive, barely.

30:07.724 --> 30:09.351
Oh, my God.

30:09.392 --> 30:10.977
-What's up?
-Shade.

30:11.019 --> 30:12.854
-Good morning.
-Hi!

30:12.896 --> 30:13.980
How are you?

30:14.022 --> 30:15.899
Oh, we're alive.

30:15.940 --> 30:18.026
Coffee with cream and sugar?

30:25.867 --> 30:27.702
I'm going on a date tonight.

30:27.744 --> 30:29.162
We're going for dinner.

30:29.204 --> 30:30.580
So, are you not coming
with us for dinner?

30:30.622 --> 30:32.624
No, yes, I'm coming
to after drinks.

30:32.665 --> 30:34.167
We're only going
for a quick one...

30:34.209 --> 30:37.087
quick dinner.

30:37.128 --> 30:38.505
I don't wanna leave.

30:38.546 --> 30:41.424
All crew, all crew,
let's be in our whites

30:41.466 --> 30:44.386
<i>and meet on the dock</i>
<i>for guest departure.</i>

30:46.846 --> 30:48.390
We're not leaving!

30:48.431 --> 30:51.559
-Whew.
-Every day, every day.

30:51.601 --> 30:53.812
Small, tiny deck man
carries small, baby bag.

30:53.853 --> 30:55.397
Shut your ----ing mouth.

30:57.857 --> 30:58.983
No, I don't wanna leave.

30:59.025 --> 31:00.610
Please don't make us.

31:00.652 --> 31:02.404
-Watch your step.
-Thank you.

31:02.445 --> 31:05.865
-You're welcome.
-Thank you so much.

31:05.907 --> 31:07.117
Thank you for everything.

31:07.158 --> 31:08.868
Next time we're
coming for longer.

31:08.910 --> 31:10.620
Okay, yes.
I'd love that.

31:10.662 --> 31:13.415
And sorry Kyle's MIA.
He's off to the dentist.

31:13.456 --> 31:15.041
He's pretty chipper
for the pain he's in.

31:15.083 --> 31:16.042
Yeah.

31:16.084 --> 31:17.168
Thank you for being so gracious.

31:17.210 --> 31:18.545
We expected a lot,

31:18.586 --> 31:21.506
but you guys exceeded
our expectations by far.

31:21.548 --> 31:24.134
We have a little
something for you.

31:24.175 --> 31:26.094
-Thank you very much.
-Thank you.

31:26.136 --> 31:27.095
Bye!

31:27.137 --> 31:28.722
Everybody into your reds

31:28.763 --> 31:30.306
and we'll meet in the main
salon for our tip meeting.

31:30.348 --> 31:32.100
-Woo!
-Nice.

31:32.142 --> 31:33.101
Are we doing a champagne shower?

31:33.143 --> 31:35.186
-Oh, yeah.
-Woo!

31:40.108 --> 31:41.234
I've got some.

31:41.276 --> 31:42.736
It's gonna be hot
out there.

31:42.777 --> 31:45.196
Dude, gonna be dripping.

31:45.238 --> 31:48.450
My love! Oh!

31:52.787 --> 31:54.122
How are you?

31:54.164 --> 31:55.623
They just removed two teeth.

31:55.665 --> 31:57.792
Tooth pain...
it's next-level.

31:57.834 --> 31:59.544
I feel so relieved.

31:59.586 --> 32:01.588
I can't wait to eat
certain foods again,

32:01.629 --> 32:04.215
I can't wait to suck on
certain things again.

32:07.427 --> 32:09.137
All crew, all crew,

32:09.179 --> 32:11.306
<i>let's meet in the main salon</i>
<i>for our tip meeting.</i>

32:15.894 --> 32:19.022
Okay, so, charter
number three down.

32:19.064 --> 32:20.482
-Mm.
-Man down.

32:20.523 --> 32:21.900
You guys did really well.

32:21.941 --> 32:23.443
New crew...

32:23.485 --> 32:25.195
Courtney, it's so great
to have you here, really.

32:25.236 --> 32:26.905
-Thanks.
-I just... you know...

32:26.946 --> 32:28.198
Everyone's been very
welcoming, thank you.

32:28.239 --> 32:29.199
Yeah.

32:29.240 --> 32:31.785
Storm, you accepted a challenge

32:31.826 --> 32:33.995
that you said you
were ready for.

32:34.037 --> 32:35.580
Sure.

32:35.622 --> 32:39.125
And I have to be honest,
like, when I came off this dock,

32:39.167 --> 32:40.460
I was worried.

32:40.502 --> 32:42.212
We're gonna hit.
One meter.

32:42.253 --> 32:45.090
Ugh.

32:45.131 --> 32:47.342
But then when I came
in last night...

32:47.384 --> 32:49.177
You guys did an excellent job!

32:49.219 --> 32:50.470
Deck team, baby!

32:50.512 --> 32:52.305
...you did a superb job.

32:52.347 --> 32:54.265
-Thanks, Sandy.
-Anyway, guess what?

32:54.307 --> 32:55.392
-Woohoo!
-This thing's really thick...

32:55.433 --> 32:58.061
-$20,000 U.S.
-Woo!

32:58.103 --> 33:00.313
Eighteen hundred dollars
per person.

33:00.355 --> 33:04.317
-Well done, everyone.
-Thank you.

33:04.359 --> 33:05.777
Let's make it rain tonight.

33:05.819 --> 33:07.445
I'm glad that this
first trip's over,

33:07.487 --> 33:09.531
because I feel like I can
relax a bit more now.

33:11.574 --> 33:13.076
In the mornings, it's Coco.

33:13.118 --> 33:16.830
And then later in the night,
if we drink, it's Chloe.

33:16.871 --> 33:19.165
Yes, daddy.

33:19.207 --> 33:20.166
[chattering]

33:20.208 --> 33:22.711
-Oh, my...
-Oh, my God!

33:22.752 --> 33:23.920
Oh, no.

33:23.962 --> 33:25.672
I will not be getting as
drunk as I used to,

33:25.714 --> 33:28.133
but I will definitely let
me hair down.

33:28.174 --> 33:29.592
I mean, I don't know, who knows?

33:31.177 --> 33:32.721
-Cheers!
-Nice work, everyone.

33:32.762 --> 33:34.514
-Cheers, everybody.
-Honestly.

33:39.894 --> 33:41.396
Hey, man, how's it going?

33:41.438 --> 33:44.357
I'd like to reserve a table
for two for tonight.

33:44.399 --> 33:46.609
You know what I've recently,
like, overcome?

33:46.651 --> 33:48.486
I've just accepted that,
you know,

33:48.528 --> 33:50.655
there's not really a
soulmate for everyone.

33:50.697 --> 33:54.909
Yeah, I think a lot of this
stuff is just, like, flings.

33:54.951 --> 33:57.037
I was just dating a guy
and he broke up with me...

33:57.078 --> 33:58.413
Excuse me?

33:58.455 --> 34:00.331
Over text, 2:00 in the morning.

34:00.373 --> 34:01.833
He wrote to me, he's like,

34:01.875 --> 34:03.376
"Sorry, I've decided that
I wanna be single."

34:03.418 --> 34:04.753
Thought it was love.

34:05.587 --> 34:06.546
When was this, by the way?

34:06.588 --> 34:07.964
Like, a month ago.

34:11.634 --> 34:13.011
So, you're just going
straight to dinner?

34:13.053 --> 34:14.471
Yeah.

34:14.512 --> 34:16.389
My last relationship
was eight months,

34:16.431 --> 34:18.266
and it got quite serious.

34:18.308 --> 34:19.851
I was prepared to leave my job,

34:19.893 --> 34:22.896
start a life with her,
and then she lost feelings.

34:22.937 --> 34:24.647
To be in a relationship
with someone,

34:24.689 --> 34:27.525
to watch them fall out of
love with you, is gnarly.

34:27.567 --> 34:29.027
But I think moderation
is for cowards,

34:29.069 --> 34:31.571
and everything worth doing
is worth overdoing.

34:31.613 --> 34:33.531
That's just who I am,
with my work,

34:33.573 --> 34:34.866
with my love,
with everything.

34:34.908 --> 34:37.744
So, just superstructure,
windows, railings.

34:37.786 --> 34:39.704
-I'm gonna be with you now.
-Cool.

34:44.668 --> 34:47.253
So, that tip was kinda, like,
the same as the last one, hey?

34:47.295 --> 34:49.005
Mm, yeah.

34:51.675 --> 34:53.468
Sure.

34:55.178 --> 34:56.846
Yeah?

35:17.701 --> 35:20.787
To me, you're kind of,
like, thinking,

35:20.829 --> 35:22.580
like, the easy way out of it.

35:22.622 --> 35:26.084
No, I guess my problem
is I just don't know...

35:26.126 --> 35:27.419
You don't know what you want.

35:27.460 --> 35:29.170
My problem is I just
run away from problems,

35:29.212 --> 35:31.256
and that's what
I've been doing.

35:31.297 --> 35:33.133
-Yeah.
-I mean...

35:33.174 --> 35:34.134
And, like, it's...

35:34.175 --> 35:35.719
It's hard to face them.

35:35.760 --> 35:39.139
And now, like,
I actually have to.

35:39.180 --> 35:41.307
What the [bleep] are you doing?

35:41.349 --> 35:42.809
What on Earth are you doing?

35:42.851 --> 35:45.103
Tash told me quite
a lot about her ex.

35:45.145 --> 35:48.148
She spoke openly to me
about it on the other boat.

35:48.189 --> 35:51.401
She told me that he cheated
on her multiple times.

35:51.443 --> 35:54.571
She told me they had
difficulties for years.

35:54.612 --> 35:56.114
He didn't seem like a great guy.

35:56.156 --> 35:58.700
This doesn't make sense.

36:03.246 --> 36:04.706
You can do your dishes any time.

36:04.748 --> 36:05.749
Hey?

36:20.638 --> 36:21.765
Oh, I did it wrong again,
what the [bleep]?

36:23.224 --> 36:24.684
Is he drunk?

36:24.726 --> 36:26.936
Mm-mmm, he's excited,
his wiener's hard.

36:26.978 --> 36:28.396
Shut up!

36:28.438 --> 36:29.856
Oh, my God, I'll see you soon.

36:29.898 --> 36:31.358
Why are you leading the way?

36:31.399 --> 36:34.569
Yeah, I don't know
where I'm going.

36:34.611 --> 36:35.612
You look beautiful, by the way.

36:35.653 --> 36:36.654
Aw, you just had to say that.

36:36.696 --> 36:37.864
No, but I like this, though.

36:37.906 --> 36:38.656
The skirt?

36:38.698 --> 36:40.825
I like everything, though.

36:40.867 --> 36:43.203
-Where are we off to?
-It's a surprise.

36:47.415 --> 36:48.917
-Thank you.
-Here's your table.

36:48.958 --> 36:50.460
I'll sit you in like
a ----ing gentleman.

36:50.502 --> 36:52.253
Oh, my gosh.

36:52.295 --> 36:53.421
I've gotta play the part, you
know, I've gotta play the part.

36:53.463 --> 36:54.964
I feel so...

36:55.006 --> 36:56.216
I swear, if you pull the chair
from underneath me...

36:56.257 --> 36:57.467
I was about to do it.

36:57.509 --> 36:58.802
I wanted to do it, but...

36:58.843 --> 37:00.011
how's it going, buddy?

37:00.053 --> 37:01.054
This is perfect.

37:01.096 --> 37:02.263
What do you recommend,
a cocktail?

37:02.305 --> 37:03.932
The Bertos.

37:03.973 --> 37:05.100
I don't even want to know
what it is, I'll have it.

37:05.141 --> 37:06.601
What's your lagers?

37:06.643 --> 37:07.852
Yeah, yeah, can I have one
in a pint, please?

37:07.894 --> 37:09.729
-Yes.
-Thanks, mate.

37:09.771 --> 37:10.772
It's a very big table, eh?

37:10.814 --> 37:12.399
I feel, like, very far from you.

37:12.440 --> 37:14.275
You've got the same nails as me.

37:14.317 --> 37:15.944
What, like, ruined?

37:21.449 --> 37:23.952
Because that would
drive me insane.

37:25.995 --> 37:27.372
Let's leave.

37:27.414 --> 37:31.001
Okay, guys, let's go.

37:31.042 --> 37:33.044
Guys, this is my first meal
with you all!

37:33.086 --> 37:36.006
Yay!

37:38.550 --> 37:40.218
No, never.

37:40.260 --> 37:41.302
In my entire life.

37:41.344 --> 37:42.929
-Shut up!
-Swear to God.

37:42.971 --> 37:44.305
What's the weirdest pet name
you've ever been called?

37:44.347 --> 37:45.390
Daddy.

37:45.432 --> 37:46.725
No one has ever
called you that.

37:46.766 --> 37:48.351
All my mates in Cape Town
call me Daddy.

37:48.393 --> 37:51.104
-Yeah, but from a girl.
-Oh.

37:52.105 --> 37:53.606
Do you exercise?

37:53.648 --> 37:56.317
Well, not when I'm working,
because I work 18 hours a day.

37:56.359 --> 37:58.653
My deck crew and I have
heaps to do tomorrow.

37:58.695 --> 38:00.488
Like, we haven't done
the corridors,

38:00.530 --> 38:02.282
we haven't done the aft.

38:02.323 --> 38:04.826
Uh, you've got four people,
so I think you'll be right.

38:04.868 --> 38:06.995
I've got a schedule for them,

38:07.037 --> 38:09.247
so now they have three
hours every day to relax.

38:09.289 --> 38:12.709
It took us two hours
to get to the main deck.

38:14.627 --> 38:17.672
Obviously, I'm very stoked to
be spending more time with her,

38:17.714 --> 38:20.508
and she's ----ing beautiful.

38:20.550 --> 38:21.676
But I am only
thinking about work.

38:21.718 --> 38:23.011
I am very nervous.

38:23.053 --> 38:24.846
Being a provisional bosun
is definitely

38:24.888 --> 38:27.515
a trial period for me, so
I've got a lot on my plate.

38:27.557 --> 38:30.518
I met you, and I'm stoked
to see where this goes...

38:30.560 --> 38:31.728
cheers.

38:31.770 --> 38:33.355
Oh, my God, okay.

38:33.396 --> 38:35.231
Yeah, I wanna sit next to Kyle.

38:35.273 --> 38:36.441
You want a candle?

38:36.483 --> 38:37.567
Yeah.

38:37.609 --> 38:39.611
Thank you.

38:39.652 --> 38:41.571
Cheers, everyone.

38:41.613 --> 38:43.531
Honestly, I just want us
to realize

38:43.573 --> 38:45.367
how calm it is without Nat.

38:45.408 --> 38:46.368
Cheers.

38:46.409 --> 38:48.036
Oh, she's here in spirit.

38:51.956 --> 38:54.167
-Thanks for dinner.
-Pleasure, babe.

38:54.209 --> 38:56.586
Woohoo!

38:56.628 --> 38:58.171
I can hear Kyle a mile away.

38:58.213 --> 38:59.714
Hi.

38:59.756 --> 39:00.840
Don't get too comfortable,
we're leaving soon.

39:00.882 --> 39:01.883
Where are we going now?

39:01.925 --> 39:03.218
We're going to the club.

39:03.259 --> 39:04.552
Yeah.

39:04.594 --> 39:05.887
Okay, let's get outta here,
guys.

39:05.929 --> 39:08.014
-All right.
-Yeah, guys, let's go.

39:08.807 --> 39:10.266
Guys, this way.

39:10.308 --> 39:11.810
Ready to rave.

39:19.651 --> 39:21.194
Shots for everyone!

39:21.236 --> 39:22.904
Yes, please!

39:31.538 --> 39:33.915
She literally just got back
with her boyfriend.

39:33.957 --> 39:35.500
So, now she can't
even be, like, sit...

39:35.542 --> 39:36.793
Did she?

39:36.835 --> 39:38.211
Yeah, she got back
with her boyfriend.

39:38.253 --> 39:39.504
So, now she can't even be,
like, seen...

39:39.546 --> 39:41.506
so, wherever I go.

39:41.548 --> 39:43.758
So, she waits to see
where I go.

39:43.800 --> 39:45.343
I'm, like, this
is ----ing terrible.

40:11.953 --> 40:13.830
-You are!
-No.

40:20.170 --> 40:21.379
And, like, I understand that...

40:21.421 --> 40:22.464
All right!

40:22.505 --> 40:23.465
And then Sandy said--

40:23.506 --> 40:24.466
Oi! Oi!

40:24.507 --> 40:26.926
-Shots.
-Shots!

40:28.053 --> 40:29.346
You know, what
I'm saying is that...

40:30.513 --> 40:31.848
Mate, mate...

40:34.517 --> 40:37.270
You need to snap out of what
a little emotional pity party

40:37.312 --> 40:38.980
this is and we need
to get ----ed up..

40:39.022 --> 40:40.482
Storm is such an over-thinker.

40:40.523 --> 40:41.900
Like, he just can't drop it.

40:41.941 --> 40:43.985
Like, keep the work chat
in the workplace.

40:44.027 --> 40:45.987
Like, we just went
out for a first date.

40:46.029 --> 40:47.572
I wanna have fun, let's dance,

40:47.614 --> 40:48.907
let's have, like, a few drinks.

40:48.948 --> 40:50.367
There's just no point
just going on.

40:50.408 --> 40:52.202
It's just very draining.

41:08.218 --> 41:10.970
I didn't ruin the vibe.
What are you talking about?

41:16.726 --> 41:19.854
-Oh, sh--.
-Where's the tip money?

41:19.896 --> 41:21.981
-Come on, guys.
-Are we outta here?

41:22.023 --> 41:23.692
Wait, now we're going to
see my vagina.

41:23.733 --> 41:25.902
Ah!

41:28.238 --> 41:29.906
Ah!

41:32.075 --> 41:34.077
I don't do emotional.

41:44.379 --> 41:45.922
Cheers, guys.

41:51.970 --> 41:53.847
I'm really hungry.

42:00.270 --> 42:02.939
I don't know what
the [bleep] happened, dude.

42:04.566 --> 42:06.151
We were having a great time.

42:06.192 --> 42:07.694
Tell me what I did wrong.

42:07.736 --> 42:09.320
You didn't do anything wrong.

42:18.747 --> 42:20.457
All right, all,
have a good night.

42:20.498 --> 42:21.958
Good night.

42:28.089 --> 42:30.967
She wanted nothing
to do with me.

42:31.009 --> 42:32.427
Let her deal with her sh--.

42:32.469 --> 42:33.678
You're not here
for a relationship,

42:33.720 --> 42:35.096
you're here to work.

42:35.138 --> 42:38.600
You've been promoted,
my friend, promoted.

42:38.641 --> 42:40.477
Yeah, mate.

42:43.480 --> 42:45.732
Appreciate it, homie.

42:45.774 --> 42:47.859
Oh, Kyle.

42:53.865 --> 42:57.452
Yeah, I know it's
so tough for you,

42:57.494 --> 43:00.872
but you came here for a
bigger purpose than Dave.

43:07.837 --> 43:09.464
You okay, buddy?

43:25.897 --> 43:27.023
Next, on "Below Deck Med"...

43:27.065 --> 43:28.650
Charter number four.

43:28.692 --> 43:31.444
I'm so excited to see who's
the new charter guests.

43:33.196 --> 43:35.573
When I saw you coming down,
I'm like, wow.

43:35.615 --> 43:37.742
You could argue
I'm being unprofessional,

43:37.784 --> 43:40.286
and I would agree.

43:44.082 --> 43:45.458
I feel like how you
feel about Storm now.

43:45.500 --> 43:48.086
He could lose
his job over this.

43:49.879 --> 43:52.340
If you wanna do a bowline,
you must do a proper bowline.

43:52.382 --> 43:55.218
This is a ----ing
proper bowline.

43:56.386 --> 43:58.138
Don't ever do that... ever.

44:02.684 --> 44:07.022
I've been struggling to deal
with the whole situation.

44:07.063 --> 44:08.189
It won't happen anymore.

44:08.231 --> 44:09.983
You're on your own now, girl.
