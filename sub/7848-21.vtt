ALL WORTHWHILE.

19:31.867 --> 19:32.400
DON'T HUG.

19:32.400 --> 19:35.200
CODY'LL THINK
YOU'RE GETTING BACK TOGETHER.

19:35.200 --> 19:37.500
NO, I WON'T.

19:38.000 --> 19:39.834
CODY, HONEY?

19:39.834 --> 19:41.500
HONEY.

19:41.500 --> 19:44.300
I KNOW YOU WERE HOPING
YOUR DAD AND I

19:44.300 --> 19:45.300
WOULD GET BACK TOGETHER,

19:45.300 --> 19:48.400
BUT EVEN IF WE'RE NOT
GETTING REMARRIED,

19:48.400 --> 19:49.834
WE'RE...

19:49.834 --> 19:51.400
STILL A FAMILY.

19:51.400 --> 19:53.734
NOT LIKE THEM.

19:53.734 --> 19:55.400
YES, LIKE THEM.

19:55.400 --> 19:58.500
THAT BABY HAS
2 PARENTS THAT LOVE HER,

19:58.500 --> 20:00.400
JUST LIKE YOU GUYS.

20:00.400 --> 20:01.567

[SOBS]

20:20.867 --> 20:22.734
I THINK THIS
BELONGS TO YOU.

20:22.734 --> 20:24.500
EVERY TIME
I THROW IT AWAY,

20:24.500 --> 20:25.500
IT KEEPS COMING BACK.

20:25.500 --> 20:30.100
I GUESS THE THIRD ARM
ACTS LIKE A BOOMERANG.

20:31.567 --> 20:34.500
HEY, LONDON,
WHAT IS THIS STITCH
UNDER THE THIRD ARM?

20:34.500 --> 20:36.100
IT'S YOUR NAME.

20:36.100 --> 20:40.000
M-A-T-E-E.
MADDIE.

20:40.000 --> 20:40.467
OH.

20:40.467 --> 20:44.567
TO THINK I'VE BEEN
SPELLING IT WRONG
ALL THESE YEARS.

20:45.100 --> 20:47.300
BOY, THIS MUST'VE
TAKEN A LOT OF WORK.

20:47.300 --> 20:49.867
SURE DID,
NOT THAT YOU CARE.

20:49.867 --> 20:51.500
WELL, I SHOULD HAVE.

20:51.500 --> 20:54.567
AND I'M SORRY I DIDN'T
APPRECIATE IT EARLIER.

20:54.567 --> 20:56.700
SO YOU REALLY LIKE IT?

20:56.700 --> 20:57.834
YES.

20:57.834 --> 21:00.400
AS MUCH AS
A CAR OR DIAMOND?

21:00.400 --> 21:02.000
DON'T PUSH IT.

21:02.000 --> 21:03.934

21:03.934 --> 21:06.600
[SIGHS]

21:09.500 --> 21:13.233

21:13.233 --> 21:16.600
[MAKES SIREN NOISE]

21:16.600 --> 21:19.367
[SIREN NOISE
QUIETS DOWN]

21:20.567 --> 21:24.000
IT MAY NOT HAVE BEEN
THE HOLIDAY WE EXPECTED,

21:24.000 --> 21:27.500
BUT WE'RE ALL HERE
HELPING EACH OTHER,

21:27.500 --> 21:28.967
AND CELEBRATING
THE MIRACLE OF LIFE.

21:28.967 --> 21:33.300
I CAN'T THINK
OF A BETTER PLACE
TO BE ON CHRISTMAS

21:33.300 --> 21:35.300
THAN THE TIPTON HOTEL.

21:35.300 --> 21:37.300
MR. MOSEBY.
OH, MR. MOSEBY.

21:37.300 --> 21:40.400
THE ROAD'S OPEN,
AND SO IS THE AIRPORT.

21:41.800 --> 21:43.900
SLOW DOWN!

21:45.000 --> 21:46.900

21:49.133 --> 21:51.100
