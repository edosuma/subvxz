♪♪

00:03.380 --> 00:05.250
Previously on Andi Mack...

00:05.250 --> 00:09.170
Every year, Cece tries so hard
to impress my Aunt Mei

00:09.170 --> 00:11.460
that it turns into
a festival of stress.

00:11.460 --> 00:15.170
Bowie's not the caterer,
he's Andi's father.

00:15.170 --> 00:16.540
He's a fabulous cook

00:16.540 --> 00:19.040
and an avid botanist.

00:20.460 --> 00:22.210
His work...

00:22.210 --> 00:24.580
Jonah gets back from
ultimate camp today.

00:24.580 --> 00:25.710
You heard from him?

00:25.710 --> 00:28.210
I didn't miss him as much
as I thought I would.

00:28.210 --> 00:29.790
Or, at all.

00:30.960 --> 00:32.080
-Hey, Shnoo.
-Yes!

00:32.080 --> 00:34.790
Andi:
Cece, do you hear me?
Pops is home.

00:34.790 --> 00:36.420
Both:
Will you marry me?

00:36.420 --> 00:37.750
Yes!

00:37.750 --> 00:38.750
-Yo!
-Yo!

00:38.750 --> 00:40.330
Andi: My parents
are getting married.

00:40.330 --> 00:41.460
Jonah: Cool.

00:41.460 --> 00:43.960
You and me...
We're...

00:43.960 --> 00:47.420
-Definitely just friends.
-Still together.

00:51.290 --> 00:53.080
Can you get it any higher?

00:53.080 --> 00:55.170
Not unless we call
the fire department.

00:56.750 --> 00:58.670
Wow. Look at this place.

00:58.670 --> 00:59.750
Ham:
Hello, girls.

00:59.750 --> 01:01.790
(scoffs) Finally.
Did you get everything?

01:01.790 --> 01:03.670
Shadyside isn't
exactly stocked up

01:03.670 --> 01:05.290
for the Moon Festival.

01:05.290 --> 01:06.790
This was the closest
we could get

01:06.790 --> 01:08.380
to a Jade Rabbit candle.

01:08.380 --> 01:10.460
Oh, well,
thanks for trying.

01:10.460 --> 01:11.920
I guess.

01:11.920 --> 01:13.750
I think a unicorn
will fit right in.

01:13.750 --> 01:15.960
Boggles the mind, huh?

01:15.960 --> 01:17.830
You've outdone yourself.

01:17.830 --> 01:19.880
It's beyond
Chinese New Year.

01:21.420 --> 01:22.500
Oh no.

01:24.040 --> 01:26.250
Please tell me
this doesn't mean
what I think it means.

01:27.880 --> 01:29.080
-(groaning)
-What?

01:29.080 --> 01:31.920
I couldn't stop her.
I tried.

01:31.920 --> 01:33.420
What are you guys
talking about?

01:33.420 --> 01:35.420
She invited Aunt Mei.

01:36.790 --> 01:38.080
You wouldn't.

01:38.080 --> 01:40.000
We only see her
once a year, right Cece?

01:40.000 --> 01:41.830
Well, I have
to formally announce

01:41.830 --> 01:44.540
Bex and Bowie's engagement
to the rest of the family.

01:44.540 --> 01:47.170
But the rest of the family
is just Aunt Mei.

01:47.170 --> 01:48.880
Really? Huh.

01:48.880 --> 01:52.170
Okay. Well, maybe it could
just be a celebration.

01:52.170 --> 01:53.500
I mean, just because
Aunt Mei is here

01:53.500 --> 01:56.040
doesn't mean it has to be
all tense and stressful

01:56.040 --> 01:58.330
with you two trying
to one up each other.

02:00.620 --> 02:03.000
It's too late, isn't it?

02:03.000 --> 02:04.540
I should have
gotten here sooner.

02:04.540 --> 02:06.670
Yeah, like 40 years ago.

Ooh, a situation.

03:02.580 --> 03:04.080
I love a good situation.

03:04.080 --> 03:06.250
Also a sticky wicket
and a brouhaha.

03:06.250 --> 03:07.620
-Are you done?
-Never.

03:08.540 --> 03:11.750
I told Jonah that I just
want to be friends.

03:11.750 --> 03:12.880
Good for you.

03:12.880 --> 03:15.620
But he still thinks
we're a couple.

03:15.620 --> 03:17.880
Ah, we have reached
the sticky part of the wicket.

03:17.880 --> 03:21.380
So I quickly backpedaled
and agreed with him.

03:21.380 --> 03:22.580
I think I was
a little premature

03:22.580 --> 03:24.000
with that
"good for you."

03:24.000 --> 03:26.790
I don't even know
why I said it.

03:26.790 --> 03:31.580
I guess a part of me
likes that he still likes me.

03:31.580 --> 03:33.670
Either way, I should
probably invite him

03:33.670 --> 03:35.170
to the Moon Festival
party, right?

03:35.170 --> 03:37.170
Yeah, you should.

03:37.170 --> 03:38.670
And if anything
gets awkward,

03:38.670 --> 03:39.790
we'll be there
to smooth things over.

03:39.790 --> 03:40.710
Thanks.

03:40.710 --> 03:42.330
That makes me feel
a lot better.

03:42.330 --> 03:43.620
Don't thank us yet.

03:43.620 --> 03:44.670
Thank us in half now.

03:44.670 --> 03:47.210
And you can thank us in full
once the job is complete.

03:53.290 --> 03:54.500
Take a look.

03:55.420 --> 03:57.750
(snorting)

03:57.750 --> 03:59.750
What's that scary
little sound mean?

03:59.750 --> 04:01.040
Oh, nothing.

04:01.040 --> 04:05.000
Just wondering
if Mei still got that same
helmet head haircut.

04:05.000 --> 04:06.460
Mom.

04:06.460 --> 04:08.170
You heard what Andi
said didn't you?

04:08.170 --> 04:10.380
Please don't make this
a competition.

04:10.380 --> 04:11.960
You don't have to win
Moon Festival.

04:13.120 --> 04:14.500
You're right.

04:14.500 --> 04:16.040
I don't have to.

04:16.040 --> 04:17.330
But I can.

04:17.330 --> 04:19.830
Between your engagement
and this look,

04:19.830 --> 04:21.500
I think I'm a lock.

04:25.540 --> 04:26.880
Oh, you don't
want to do that.

04:26.880 --> 04:28.670
Why not?

04:28.670 --> 04:30.080
Mooncakes are
the Chinese version

04:30.080 --> 04:31.710
of a Christmas fruit cake.

04:31.710 --> 04:33.540
But they look so delicious.

04:33.540 --> 04:35.000
And I'm feeling
really dessert-y.

04:35.000 --> 04:37.250
They're filled
with bean paste.

04:37.250 --> 04:39.670
I've lost
that dessert-y feeling.

04:39.670 --> 04:41.500
Oh, I better remember
to warn Jonah.

04:41.500 --> 04:43.710
After what happened
at Chinese New Year,

04:43.710 --> 04:45.250
he's pretty brave
to take on another holiday.

04:45.250 --> 04:47.380
That reminds me,
I have to warn Cece

04:47.380 --> 04:49.080
that I invited Jonah too.

04:49.080 --> 04:51.830
Nothing says "party"
like dishing out
a bunch of warnings.

04:55.210 --> 04:58.290
Oh, the bowl I sent you!
I wasn't sure you liked it.

04:58.290 --> 05:00.830
Of course I do.
It's lovely.

05:00.830 --> 05:02.710
You filled it with chips.

05:02.710 --> 05:05.120
Taro chips.
To dispel bad luck.

05:05.120 --> 05:07.170
It's a Tibetan singing bowl!

05:07.170 --> 05:09.540
You use it to create
healing vibrations!

05:09.540 --> 05:11.290
But when it's not singing,

05:11.290 --> 05:13.750
it also works
as a "bowl" bowl.

05:13.750 --> 05:15.420
(doorbell rings)

05:15.420 --> 05:19.040
It's Mei!
She's early!

05:19.040 --> 05:21.000
-Family! Places!
-I'm gonna get that.

05:21.000 --> 05:22.750
Oh, no, no. Andi, you need
to get in your spot.

05:22.750 --> 05:24.540
But it's probably
Buffy or Cyrus

05:24.540 --> 05:26.120
or, it could really even be...

05:28.380 --> 05:30.040
Oh, oh. No, no, no.
Not tonight.

05:30.040 --> 05:31.000
The stakes are too high.

05:32.420 --> 05:33.580
(speaking in Cantonese)

05:35.080 --> 05:37.380
You used
the right dialect...

05:37.380 --> 05:39.380
You're dressed
appropriately...

05:40.540 --> 05:43.540
You even brought me
my second favorite tea.

05:43.540 --> 05:44.500
Get in here.

05:45.710 --> 05:48.710
Wait. We're here
for the moon, too.

05:48.710 --> 05:50.540
Uh... How thoughtful?

05:50.540 --> 05:51.670
It's not a gift.

05:51.670 --> 05:53.210
This is to keep
the mosquitos away.

05:53.210 --> 05:55.830
The Goodman blood
is like nectar to them.

05:55.830 --> 05:59.170
It's true. Like moths
to a swollen, itchy flame.

06:01.210 --> 06:03.500
This is actually
a singing bowl, you know,

06:03.500 --> 06:05.710
when it's not
filled with chips.

06:06.830 --> 06:09.500
Look at Jonah, already
killing it at the party.

06:09.500 --> 06:11.000
He's like
the perfect boyfriend.

06:11.000 --> 06:13.500
Okay, he politely
accepted a snack.

06:13.500 --> 06:15.380
We don't have
to give him a blue ribbon.

06:15.380 --> 06:17.380
Mei is point two miles away.

06:17.380 --> 06:19.000
Uh, how do you know that?

06:19.000 --> 06:20.790
I'm tracking her ride.

06:20.790 --> 06:22.380
(groaning)

06:22.380 --> 06:24.080
If she doesn't
turn off location services,

06:24.080 --> 06:26.500
she's practically
begging me to spy on her.

06:26.500 --> 06:28.580
Family, take your places!

06:28.580 --> 06:29.750
What's happening?

06:29.750 --> 06:31.790
We have to create
a "family tableau"

06:31.790 --> 06:33.040
so that everything
is perfect

06:33.040 --> 06:35.540
when CeCe announces
Bex and Bowie's engagement.

06:35.540 --> 06:36.920
Andi! Your mark!

06:36.920 --> 06:38.580
Good luck.
We'll stay clear.

06:38.580 --> 06:39.620
Okay.

06:41.620 --> 06:43.170
Alright, tilt
your head like this,

06:43.170 --> 06:45.290
and remember,
look natural.

It's the Moon Festival!

08:43.000 --> 08:44.330

this great party.

08:44.330 --> 08:46.580
And she looks amazing.

08:46.580 --> 08:49.040
And her daughter's
getting married.

08:49.040 --> 08:51.710
Oh. Oh, the babies
are moving.

08:51.710 --> 08:53.500
The babies are moving.

08:55.040 --> 08:56.580
I'm gonna go see
if she's okay.

08:58.250 --> 08:59.330
Whoo!

09:06.710 --> 09:08.580
Why did I wipe the wax?

09:08.580 --> 09:11.000
That was so dumb.

09:11.000 --> 09:13.790
These things happen.
No need to panic.

09:13.790 --> 09:15.000
Take a deep breath.

09:15.000 --> 09:17.420
(both breathe deeply)

09:17.420 --> 09:19.040
There you go.

09:19.040 --> 09:20.670
I wish I didn't
have to be here.

09:20.670 --> 09:21.960
You were doing so well.

09:21.960 --> 09:25.040
Aggh! It's so stressful!

09:25.040 --> 09:26.580
I mean, saying
the right things,

09:26.580 --> 09:27.960
wearing the right clothes,

09:27.960 --> 09:29.000
buying the right tea--

09:29.000 --> 09:32.040
You have no idea
how many teas are out there.

09:32.040 --> 09:32.960
Somewhere around
three thousand.

09:32.960 --> 09:34.710
-That's too many.
-I know.

09:34.710 --> 09:36.120
And now this mess.

09:36.120 --> 09:37.080
This is nothing.

09:37.080 --> 09:38.120
At my Bubbe's birthday,

09:38.120 --> 09:39.880
I had to help her
blow out the candles.

09:39.880 --> 09:41.920
Eighty-five,
plus one to grow on.

09:41.920 --> 09:44.250
Bubbe was covered in wax.

09:44.250 --> 09:45.290
And then
this one Hanukkah--

09:45.290 --> 09:47.460
Cyrus.

09:47.460 --> 09:48.830
Just how do I fix this?

09:52.000 --> 09:55.920
Well, now that
the wax is dry...

09:55.920 --> 09:57.540
We just scrape it off.

09:59.000 --> 10:01.790
Cyrus, you're a life-saver.

10:01.790 --> 10:04.000
This is so much easier
without Bubbe squirming.

10:04.000 --> 10:05.080
-The paint!
-(gasps)

10:18.210 --> 10:21.000
Lotus seed.
My favorite paste.

10:28.790 --> 10:31.380
Mmm, good tea.

10:31.380 --> 10:32.540
Oolong.

10:33.960 --> 10:35.420
Isn't it wonderful?

10:35.420 --> 10:39.040
Mothers and daughters
together, bonding.

10:40.170 --> 10:42.380
The Joy Luck Club's
got nothing on us.

10:55.120 --> 10:56.960
Do you think Bex is okay?

10:56.960 --> 10:58.120
Why wouldn't she be?

10:58.120 --> 11:00.960
We left her alone
with Celia, Mei and Ling.

11:00.960 --> 11:03.000
She might need back-up.

11:03.000 --> 11:04.540
I should go in.

11:05.710 --> 11:07.040
What do you think?

11:07.040 --> 11:09.540
You're just gonna
just flash your smile
and twinkle your eyes

11:09.540 --> 11:11.120
and everything's
gonna be okay?

11:11.120 --> 11:13.710
Well... yeah.

11:14.830 --> 11:16.710
I'm sure she's fine.

11:18.170 --> 11:20.960
But keep that twinkle
and smile on standby,

11:20.960 --> 11:22.210
just in case.

11:22.210 --> 11:24.420
I have a pretty great
pout too,

11:24.420 --> 11:26.080
in case we need that.

11:26.080 --> 11:28.420
Sorry, that's my department.

11:28.420 --> 11:30.040
I own pout.

11:31.920 --> 11:33.960
Ooh, that is pretty good.

11:36.620 --> 11:38.120
Hey guys. What are you--

11:38.120 --> 11:39.960
(gasps)
Bad.

11:39.960 --> 11:41.210
We know. Can you
help us fix it?

11:41.210 --> 11:44.420
No! I want
no part of this.

11:44.420 --> 11:48.250
Too late.
You've seen it. You're in.

11:48.250 --> 11:49.750
We need a plan.

11:49.750 --> 11:50.880
-Do you have one?
-Yes.

11:50.880 --> 11:53.040
-What is it?
-Asking you guys for help.

11:55.170 --> 11:57.040
(all laughing and chatting)

11:59.120 --> 12:02.250
Well, Bowie was
a rock star touring with
the Renaissance Boys,

12:02.250 --> 12:06.210
but gave it all up
to be with Bex and Andi.

12:06.210 --> 12:08.080
Well, my son-in-law
would've been here

12:08.080 --> 12:10.620
except he is at
a gum disease conference.

12:10.620 --> 12:11.920
-Ew.
-Ugh.

12:11.920 --> 12:14.250
I think rock star
wins this round.

12:16.250 --> 12:18.170
I want to talk
about your wedding.

12:18.170 --> 12:19.290
When's the big day?

12:19.290 --> 12:21.620
-We haven't
gotten that far yet.
-No.

12:21.620 --> 12:25.000
Well, word to the wise,
start planning soon.

12:25.000 --> 12:27.790
My wedding took
fifteen months to prepare.

12:27.790 --> 12:30.710
Fifteen months?
No thank you.

12:30.710 --> 12:32.710
We could just
get married at City Hall.

12:32.710 --> 12:34.250
That's fine by me.

12:34.250 --> 12:35.540
Andi, quick question.

12:35.540 --> 12:36.960
Cyrus, not now!

12:36.960 --> 12:40.330
City Hall?
Well, that would be lovely.

12:40.330 --> 12:42.670
It's a destination wedding.

12:42.670 --> 12:44.960
-Oh, don't be ridiculous.
-She's gonna have a wedding.

12:44.960 --> 12:46.290
-There's gonna be a wedding.
-Obviously.

12:46.290 --> 12:47.880
Maid of honor,
ready to go.

12:50.040 --> 12:51.540
I need toothpaste.

12:51.540 --> 12:53.040
Cyrus, your breath is fine.

12:53.040 --> 12:55.620
-I have a situation.
-I have a bigger one.

12:57.250 --> 12:59.830
Buffy: Toothpaste cleans
plaque not wax.

12:59.830 --> 13:02.040
This from one sneeze?

13:02.040 --> 13:03.790
How did this happen?

13:04.920 --> 13:06.790
I don't know.

13:06.790 --> 13:11.580
I'm just a boy,
standing in front of a wall,

13:11.580 --> 13:13.460
trying to cover it
with toothpaste.

13:19.960 --> 13:22.000
It doesn't matter
how hard I try,

13:23.290 --> 13:26.250
every time I come
to one of your family parties,

13:26.250 --> 13:27.620
I mess up.

13:29.880 --> 13:31.500
You deserve
a better boyfriend.

13:32.460 --> 13:35.040
If I were you,
I'd break up with me.

13:38.880 --> 13:42.210
That was a joke.
I was kidding.

13:54.620 --> 13:56.250
Do you want to
break up with me?

14:03.080 --> 14:04.080
Let's talk.

14:09.540 --> 14:11.120
Should we keep doing this,

14:11.120 --> 14:13.250
or can we just walk away?

14:13.250 --> 14:15.460
I don't think
we can walk away.

14:15.460 --> 14:16.960
But I'm willing to try.

14:21.580 --> 14:23.170
I wasn't here
from the beginning.

14:23.170 --> 14:24.830
I just came on
at toothpaste.

14:26.040 --> 14:28.250
I don't know
what we're gonna do
about this mess.

14:30.960 --> 14:32.170
Yes, I do.

14:32.170 --> 14:34.500
It's nothing, I can fix it
in like, two minutes.

14:36.580 --> 14:39.420
Who ever gave you
the idea to use toothpaste?

14:39.420 --> 14:41.120
And my toothbrush?

14:41.120 --> 14:43.710
All the others
were electric.

14:43.710 --> 14:45.250
Go. Go, go, go.

14:46.540 --> 14:48.920
(laughing) God.

14:50.250 --> 14:51.710
City Hall?

14:51.710 --> 14:54.790
How could you say City Hall?
In front of my sister!

14:54.790 --> 14:56.330
Well, I'm sorry.

14:56.330 --> 14:58.420
Maybe you're forgetting--
it's my wedding,

14:58.420 --> 14:59.830
which means I get to
do things my way.

14:59.830 --> 15:01.380
That's not how it works.

15:01.380 --> 15:03.710
No? How does it work?

15:03.710 --> 15:05.790
I get to plan your wedding,

15:05.790 --> 15:07.790
but I convince you
it was your idea.

15:09.250 --> 15:11.380
Is that true?
Is that how it works?

15:11.380 --> 15:15.000
Well, it can be a very fun
and bonding experience

15:15.000 --> 15:17.170
for a mother
and daughter to share.

15:17.170 --> 15:21.420
I just... I want
my wedding to be simple.

15:21.420 --> 15:24.210
And small. No fuss.

15:24.210 --> 15:25.620
Then it will be.

15:28.290 --> 15:30.460
I'm really not opposed
to having it at City Hall.

15:32.710 --> 15:36.460
But I am sorry I said that
in front of Aunt Mei.

15:36.460 --> 15:37.790
Did you hear her cackle

15:37.790 --> 15:40.250
about how she'd be able
to pay her parking tickets?

15:41.830 --> 15:44.380
Maybe... we don't invite her?

15:45.540 --> 15:48.420
See? We're bonding already!

15:48.420 --> 15:50.790
I can't even look
at that mooncake she brought.

15:50.790 --> 15:52.080
(both make gagging sounds)

15:54.330 --> 15:55.580
Let me see
if I got this.

15:55.580 --> 15:57.330
You don't want
to break up.

15:58.920 --> 16:03.210
No. Those words,
they're so awful.

16:03.210 --> 16:05.540
But you don't want to be
a couple anymore either?

16:08.040 --> 16:09.330
Huh.

16:13.750 --> 16:18.750
Jonah, I like you so much,

16:21.460 --> 16:24.000
but I just want
to be friends.

16:26.880 --> 16:29.120
I'm sorry.

16:29.120 --> 16:31.080
Don't be sorry.

16:31.080 --> 16:33.460
I just... I wanna
be friends, too.

16:35.040 --> 16:36.210
But you said that--

16:36.210 --> 16:38.380
I didn't want to
"break up" with you either.

16:38.380 --> 16:40.880
I thought there were
only two options.

16:44.380 --> 16:48.420
So we both want to go back
to just being friends.

16:48.420 --> 16:49.710
But you don't want
to break up with me,

16:49.710 --> 16:51.170
and I don't want
to break up with you.

16:52.380 --> 16:53.960
Is that allowed?

16:53.960 --> 16:55.330
I don't know.

16:56.540 --> 16:58.250
But I think
we just did it.

17:04.880 --> 17:08.380
Oh, there you are.
I was looking for you.

17:08.380 --> 17:09.670
I didn't want you
to get upset.

17:09.670 --> 17:11.460
There was a little accident
with the candle wax--

17:11.460 --> 17:13.170
I don't care.

17:13.170 --> 17:14.620
Excuse me now?

17:15.790 --> 17:18.960
I really thought I was gonna
win Moon Festival.

17:18.960 --> 17:22.380
You lost?
Oh, I had no idea.

17:22.380 --> 17:24.420
When did the final
results come in?

17:27.380 --> 17:33.040
Celia, thank you
for another lovely holiday.

17:33.040 --> 17:35.670
What? You're not gonna stay
for the floating lanterns?

17:35.670 --> 17:37.830
Oh, Ling needs her rest.

17:37.830 --> 17:40.120
She's eating and sleeping
for three now.

17:40.120 --> 17:43.330
Mei, you don't need
to keep rubbing it in.

17:43.330 --> 17:45.290
I'm truly happy for you.

17:45.290 --> 17:47.750
For all of you.

17:47.750 --> 17:49.710
But wait. We don't have
a picture of you two.

17:49.710 --> 17:51.250
Ham: We need a picture.

17:51.250 --> 17:52.500
Do we?

17:52.500 --> 17:54.460
Trust me.

17:54.460 --> 17:57.460
Okay, so, scoot back
just a little.

17:57.460 --> 17:59.120
Little bit more.

17:59.120 --> 18:01.040
Just a... Oh! Perfect.

18:01.040 --> 18:02.120
And...

18:04.250 --> 18:05.750
Ham: Look
how beautiful you look.

18:05.750 --> 18:08.080
-Text it to me.
-Oh, for sure.

18:10.250 --> 18:11.380
Why did we need
that picture?

18:11.380 --> 18:13.120
So we can get this one.

18:15.080 --> 18:18.170
-(both laughing)
-Text it to me.

18:18.170 --> 18:19.460
Oh, yes!

18:20.540 --> 18:21.830
Okay, everybody.

18:21.830 --> 18:24.080
Write down a wish
you to send up
in your lantern.

18:24.080 --> 18:26.460
-I'll take two.
-No. One wish per lantern.

18:27.620 --> 18:29.670
I'm bringing my own
rice paper next time.

18:29.670 --> 18:31.880
So, how'd it go
with Jonah?

18:31.880 --> 18:33.380
Great! We're just friends.

18:33.380 --> 18:35.460
-You broke up with him.
-Nope.

18:35.460 --> 18:38.880
-He broke up with you?
-Nope.

18:38.880 --> 18:40.790

Walker.

-Great.

Walker.

21:18.250 --> 21:19.540
What are you doing here?

21:19.540 --> 21:20.620
We need to talk.
