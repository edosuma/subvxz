WEBVTT

00:04.041 --> 00:06.125
Okay, Charlie. Let's go.

00:06.375 --> 00:07.875
Time for Daddy to take you to school.

00:09.625 --> 00:10.667
Forgetting something, Bob?

00:11.250 --> 00:12.542
Um... uh,

00:12.625 --> 00:13.959
keys, wallet, phone.

00:14.041 --> 00:14.917
No, I'm good.

00:17.166 --> 00:18.250
How about your pants?

00:20.166 --> 00:22.291
You're not taking Charlie
to school in your bathrobe.

00:23.000 --> 00:26.250
Honey, it's Little Dolphins Preschool.
It's not Buckingham Palace.

00:27.542 --> 00:29.709
- Go change.
- I haven't showered yet.

00:30.417 --> 00:34.542
Then I gotta get dressed, take Charlie,
come back, get undressed, shower,

00:34.625 --> 00:36.417
then get dressed all over again.

00:37.333 --> 00:38.959
You mean like a regular person?

00:39.583 --> 00:42.625
Hey, he's planning on taking a shower.
Let's not push it.

00:44.583 --> 00:45.625
Teddy, you want a ride?

00:45.709 --> 00:46.917
Yeah, but you...

00:47.208 --> 00:48.875
can drop me off a block away.

00:50.041 --> 00:51.166
Me too.

00:57.208 --> 00:58.542
- Bye.
- Amy: Bye.

01:00.000 --> 01:00.917
Hey, guys.

01:01.000 --> 01:03.583
Hey, honey I'm so glad you're here,
I need you to do something for me.

01:03.667 --> 01:05.041
Oh, again?

01:05.875 --> 01:09.375
You know, for once,
I'd like to just drop off my dirties,

01:09.458 --> 01:12.792
eat the breakfast you make for me and
leave with my clothes clean and folded.

01:15.792 --> 01:17.125
I'll pass that on to the staff.

01:17.792 --> 01:20.375
Okay, look. I need you to take Toby
to the playground later.

01:20.458 --> 01:21.333
And you're going too.

01:21.625 --> 01:22.709
Why me?

01:22.792 --> 01:25.291
Because your brother has a bad record
with babies.

01:26.542 --> 01:29.709
- What are you talking about?
- Oh, come on. You lost Charlie.

01:29.792 --> 01:30.667
Twice.

01:31.208 --> 01:32.917
You raced Charlie. Twice.

01:34.125 --> 01:35.792
And those are the things I know about.

01:37.083 --> 01:39.166
When did I become the responsible one?

01:39.250 --> 01:41.333
Oh, honey, you didn't.
I'm just out of options.

01:43.125 --> 01:44.792

02:49.750 --> 02:50.750
No, thank you.

02:53.709 --> 02:55.083
Mr. Duncan.

02:55.166 --> 02:56.750
Hey, teacher Emma!

02:57.000 --> 02:59.542
It's "Director" now. And it's Emily.

03:00.250 --> 03:02.583
Oh, wow, look at that.
They even promoted your name.

03:03.125 --> 03:05.166
Well, congratulations, Director Emily.

03:05.250 --> 03:07.667
Uh... I hate to ask you this.

03:08.333 --> 03:11.959
But, you do know
you're in a bathrobe, right?

03:12.041 --> 03:14.083
I was just dropping Charlie off.

03:14.166 --> 03:16.542
You know what? I'm in, I'm out,
you won't even know I'm here.

03:16.625 --> 03:18.750
Oh, but I do know you're here.

03:19.208 --> 03:21.542
And you're in violation of our dress code.

03:21.625 --> 03:23.959
You've got a dress code for drop-off?

03:24.041 --> 03:25.125
And pick-up.

03:25.750 --> 03:27.041
We have rules here.

03:27.417 --> 03:30.166
And I expect all parents to follow them.

03:31.583 --> 03:33.083
Come on!

03:33.792 --> 03:36.166
Oh! I put four kids
through Little Dolphins.

03:36.250 --> 03:38.125
How about cutting me a little slack?

03:38.208 --> 03:40.542
What I'd like to cut you, Mr. Duncan...

03:40.625 --> 03:41.917
Are some slacks.

03:49.333 --> 03:51.458
Hey, Kelsey. How was practice?

03:51.542 --> 03:54.709
Not good. There was this accident,
and one of the girls got hurt.

03:55.250 --> 03:56.166
Oh, no.

03:56.250 --> 03:59.000
I'd explain it to you, but it involves
a lot of technical cheerleading stuff

03:59.083 --> 04:00.250
you
probably wouldn't understand.

04:02.000 --> 04:03.542
- What happened?
- We dropped her.

04:05.417 --> 04:08.667
Yeah, she's okay. But now we have to
replace her before our big trip to Oahu.

04:09.333 --> 04:10.458
Oahu?

04:10.709 --> 04:13.250
Yeah, it's where the National
Cheerleading Competition is this year.

04:13.542 --> 04:15.083
Oh, man!

04:15.375 --> 04:18.250
I love that place.
I went there with my family.

04:18.333 --> 04:20.542
I'd love to go there without my family.

04:21.875 --> 04:23.625
Yeah, well, tryouts are later.

04:24.250 --> 04:27.417
- I could try out.
- Really? That would be awesome!

04:27.500 --> 04:29.250
Go, Teddy!

04:32.250 --> 04:33.166
Hi, Gabe.

04:33.750 --> 04:34.834
Hi, Kelsey.

04:37.500 --> 04:39.250
I didn't know you were a cheerleader.

04:39.750 --> 04:42.458
- I am. And you know who else might be?
- Gabe: Hmm?

04:44.417 --> 04:46.375
I thought you said
you didn't like cheerleaders.

04:46.458 --> 04:48.333
They were always the dumbest
kids in school.

04:49.458 --> 04:51.458
No, Gabe.

04:51.542 --> 04:55.375
I said they're the funnest kids in school.

04:56.125 --> 04:58.250
Yeah, we are super fun.

04:59.667 --> 05:01.458
You know, the coach
actually tried to recruit me

05:01.542 --> 05:02.959
to The Squad freshman year.

05:04.250 --> 05:05.667
Why?

05:06.917 --> 05:08.083
Isn't it obvious?

05:08.166 --> 05:09.625
Imagine all this...

05:10.417 --> 05:11.583
in that.

05:13.375 --> 05:14.333
Now, you've ruined it.

05:24.959 --> 05:28.667
All right, since we have to be here,
can we at least make things interesting?

05:28.750 --> 05:29.625
How about a bet?

05:30.208 --> 05:31.166
I'm listening.

05:31.250 --> 05:32.291
All right.

05:32.917 --> 05:34.083
How about this?

05:34.583 --> 05:36.917
I bet you can't fit into this baby swing.

05:37.291 --> 05:38.166
Oh, yeah?

05:38.834 --> 05:40.917
Well, a cheeseburger says I can.

05:41.625 --> 05:42.875
- You're on.
- Hold on.

05:43.375 --> 05:44.583
A cheeseburger with onions.

05:45.250 --> 05:46.375
- Fine.
- Hold on.

05:47.375 --> 05:48.208
And mustard.

05:49.375 --> 05:51.333
- Fine.
- And not just plain old yellow mustard,

05:51.417 --> 05:53.834
- I'm talking about the kind of mustard--
- Okay, just do it.

05:53.917 --> 05:55.000
Okay. All right.

06:02.333 --> 06:03.333
Hang on.

06:06.959 --> 06:08.750
Okay, this is not over.

06:09.250 --> 06:11.333
I have an idea.

06:11.667 --> 06:12.583
Let's go!

06:13.333 --> 06:14.583
Forgetting something?

06:16.500 --> 06:17.917
I knew that.

06:18.709 --> 06:20.834
You don't actually think I'd forget a baby
three times, do you?

06:21.625 --> 06:23.250
Let's take it one bet at a time.

06:32.250 --> 06:33.959
- Hey, girls.
- Hey, mom.

06:34.250 --> 06:35.375
Whatcha doing?

06:35.458 --> 06:38.250
My friend Kelsey sent me this video
of a cheerleading routine.

06:38.375 --> 06:39.875
I have to learn it for tryouts.

06:40.458 --> 06:41.458
Really?

06:42.417 --> 06:44.333
Okay, so I looked through
all of your old yearbooks

06:44.417 --> 06:46.208
to confirm you were never a cheerleader.

06:46.291 --> 06:47.792
That's why I'm telling you this.

06:49.333 --> 06:50.542
Well, honey.

06:50.625 --> 06:51.917
You know, I had to choose.

06:52.000 --> 06:55.250
Be one of many cheerleaders
or be the mascot.

06:56.208 --> 06:58.792
There's only one Wammy the Rammy!

06:59.959 --> 07:02.917
Charlie, honey, have I ever told you
about my years as Wammy the Rammy?

07:04.166 --> 07:05.250
Coming!

07:10.208 --> 07:12.625
Mom, I'm kind of surprised
you chose mascot,

07:12.709 --> 07:15.125
since your face was
hidden under a giant head.

07:15.208 --> 07:17.625
Mm-hmm. I struggled with that.

07:18.667 --> 07:20.750
But then I realized that the head...

07:21.250 --> 07:22.542
could fall off...

07:22.625 --> 07:24.250
twice a performance.

07:24.583 --> 07:26.166
Which became my trademark.

07:27.000 --> 07:28.125
Good luck.

07:33.542 --> 07:34.667
Is she gone?

07:35.792 --> 07:37.125
All clear, Charlie.

07:40.583 --> 07:43.291
Okay, Teddy. Here's the routine.
See if you can stay with me.

07:44.583 --> 07:47.250
Seven, eight... run, run, run, run.

07:47.375 --> 07:49.041
Step, turn, step, turn.

07:49.125 --> 07:50.709
Kelsey: Run, run, run, run.

07:50.792 --> 07:52.667
Step, turn, step, turn.

07:52.750 --> 07:54.458
Step, step, hip, cross.

07:54.542 --> 07:56.375
Open, cross, down, up.

07:56.458 --> 07:57.834
Go Rams!

07:58.750 --> 08:00.166
And that's all there is to it.

08:01.041 --> 08:02.291
Piece of cake.

08:04.000 --> 08:05.250
Where are you going?

08:05.333 --> 08:07.792
I'm going to the Mall to
get some things for Oahu.

08:08.000 --> 08:09.125
That's right, Charlie.

08:09.208 --> 08:11.834
Your sister's going to Hawaii!

08:12.083 --> 08:13.875
Hey hey! Hoot, hoot!

08:13.959 --> 08:15.750
I'm off to buy a bathing suit.

08:15.834 --> 08:17.667
Hey hey, hoot, hoot...

08:17.750 --> 08:18.834
Woo!

08:23.709 --> 08:25.583
Now, here's where it get complicated.

08:40.959 --> 08:41.959
Uh-oh.

08:55.542 --> 08:56.542
Huh!

08:58.792 --> 09:01.208
Okay, what's with the huh-ing?

09:02.417 --> 09:06.709
Oh, Director Emily had a little problem
with my robe this morning.

09:07.333 --> 09:10.750
Oh, I'm sorry, Bob. I should have said
something before you left.

09:12.625 --> 09:13.500
Look...

09:13.583 --> 09:15.750
uh, according to the
Little Dolphins handbook...

09:16.834 --> 09:18.417
"When dropping off children,

09:18.834 --> 09:22.792
pajamas, lounge-wear and
sleepwear of any kind"...

09:23.208 --> 09:24.959
are strictly prohibited".

09:25.208 --> 09:27.667
It's no big deal, Bob,
okay? Just let it go.

09:27.959 --> 09:30.041
Oh, just let it go. Just like that.

09:30.417 --> 09:31.667
Yeah, just like that.

09:32.709 --> 09:35.208
All right, all right, all right.
I'll... I'll let it go.

09:35.291 --> 09:36.417
I'm letting it go.

09:36.625 --> 09:37.625
Look.

09:38.583 --> 09:41.667
It's gone.

09:41.750 --> 09:42.667
Good.

09:44.792 --> 09:46.375
Oh, no.

09:55.542 --> 09:57.583
You really wanna win this bet, don't you?

09:57.792 --> 09:59.458
It is now a question of honor.

10:00.041 --> 10:02.583
You're buttering your legs
to fit into a baby swing.

10:04.041 --> 10:05.667
Honor comes in many flavors.

10:09.667 --> 10:10.750
Okay.

10:16.125 --> 10:17.000
Uh-huh.

10:18.792 --> 10:20.166
Ah, yes!

10:20.792 --> 10:22.166
Yeah!

10:22.250 --> 10:23.375
Yeah!

10:23.917 --> 10:25.125
Yup. Oh!

10:28.709 --> 10:29.750
And I'm stuck.

10:31.000 --> 10:32.125
Stuck?

10:32.917 --> 10:35.250
- Are you sure?
- Yup yup, I'm sure.

10:36.500 --> 10:37.583
Okay, well, I...

10:38.250 --> 10:39.709
I guess I should probably do something.

10:39.792 --> 10:41.083
- How about this?
- What?

10:41.375 --> 10:42.333
- Whee!
- Hey!

10:45.750 --> 10:47.125
Whee!

10:54.041 --> 10:56.375
Mrs. Lutes, hello!

10:56.458 --> 11:00.417
Teddy Duncan. I was a little surprised
to see your name on the sign-up sheet.

11:00.750 --> 11:03.500
Why? We've talked about
cheerleading before.

11:03.583 --> 11:07.458
Right, I remember that conversation.
I suggested you try out and you said...

11:07.542 --> 11:10.667
"I'll become a cheerleader
when I lose 50 I.Q. Points".

11:13.834 --> 11:15.542
I say some crazy things.

11:17.208 --> 11:20.458
No, uh, I have so much respect
for cheerleading now.

11:20.542 --> 11:22.709
I've seen "bring it on", like...

11:23.375 --> 11:24.250
twice.

11:26.250 --> 11:29.125
This has nothing to do
with our big trip, does it?

11:29.208 --> 11:30.500
You're taking a trip?

11:30.792 --> 11:33.417
Wait. This is the first
I'm hearing of this.

11:34.667 --> 11:37.083
All right, let's see what you got.

11:39.625 --> 11:40.583
Hit it.

11:44.667 --> 11:46.208
Woo! Woo!

11:48.417 --> 11:50.000
Woo! Woo!

11:53.458 --> 11:54.709
Go Rams!

11:57.875 --> 11:58.834
Keep going.

12:20.166 --> 12:21.583
Go Rams!

12:29.959 --> 12:32.750
I don't understand.
How can you get in, but not out?

12:32.834 --> 12:34.542
Oh, it's hot, and...

12:34.625 --> 12:36.417
my legs are cooking with all this butter.

12:37.208 --> 12:39.625
They've swelled up like a couple
of hairy hot dogs.

12:45.458 --> 12:46.625
Oh, hey, Mom.

12:47.125 --> 12:49.166
Yeah, no, we'll be home soon.
I just, uh...

12:49.250 --> 12:51.125
Just gotta get this kid outta the swing.

12:51.959 --> 12:53.834
All right, I'll talk to you soon.
Okay, bye.

12:54.709 --> 12:56.125
Dude, you gotta get me outta here.

12:56.750 --> 12:58.542
I'm losing feeling in my hot dogs.

13:00.792 --> 13:02.583
My buns don't feel so good either.

13:12.917 --> 13:13.875
Hey, what's wrong?

13:14.375 --> 13:15.583
I blew my...

13:15.959 --> 13:17.834
- stupid cheerleading tryout.
- Oh.

13:18.083 --> 13:19.583
So, what's the big deal?

13:19.667 --> 13:21.417
I fail at stupid things all the time.

13:23.250 --> 13:24.375
Kinda what I'm known for.

13:25.834 --> 13:28.208
Yeah, well, I'm known for being a winner.

13:28.875 --> 13:32.375
Teddy, a winner is someone who gets
back up after being knocked down.

13:32.583 --> 13:34.333
No, PJ.

13:34.625 --> 13:37.375
A winner is someone who doesn't lose.

13:39.667 --> 13:41.041
So much for that fortune cookie.

13:43.250 --> 13:45.333
I just can't believe
I'm not going to Oahu.

13:45.625 --> 13:46.792
It's all my own fault.

13:47.875 --> 13:49.417
Let me tell you a story, sis.

13:51.333 --> 13:53.959
This is a story that
happened a long, long time ago.

13:54.875 --> 13:55.834
Not today.

13:57.375 --> 13:58.375
There was this guy

13:59.125 --> 14:00.417
who made a bet with his brother...

14:00.834 --> 14:03.750
that he could fit into a baby swing.

14:03.834 --> 14:05.458
Now, he couldn't at first, but...

14:06.083 --> 14:07.500
did he give up?

14:08.041 --> 14:09.834
No.

14:10.750 --> 14:12.041
He buttered up his legs...

14:14.083 --> 14:15.625
Forced 'em into that swing.

14:17.458 --> 14:18.709
Now, that's what I call a winner.

14:22.333 --> 14:24.333
You're wearing a baby swing, aren't you?

14:26.375 --> 14:27.458
I might be.

14:29.792 --> 14:32.000
Quick! Mom's coming upstairs! Hide! Go go!

14:39.375 --> 14:41.041
What... Mom is not home.

14:41.333 --> 14:43.333
I know, I just wanted to
see him run around like that.

14:49.125 --> 14:50.583
Good morning, Charlie.

14:50.667 --> 14:52.250
Did mommy drop you off today?

14:52.333 --> 14:53.208
No.

14:57.750 --> 14:58.959
Good morning.

15:00.834 --> 15:01.792
Bye, Daddy.

15:02.250 --> 15:03.583
Sayonara, Sweetie.

15:06.792 --> 15:07.792
Mr. Duncan?

15:08.500 --> 15:10.583
I thought we discussed the dress code.

15:11.000 --> 15:14.417
Yes. And I read the
handbook cover to cover.

15:14.875 --> 15:16.542
Then why are you wearing a robe?

15:17.000 --> 15:18.291
Oh!

15:18.375 --> 15:20.041
No. This is not a robe.

15:20.542 --> 15:22.583
This is a kimono.

15:23.208 --> 15:25.333
It is a traditional Japanese garment.

15:25.417 --> 15:27.834
Often worn at weddings and tea ceremonies.

15:27.917 --> 15:31.709
It is not sleepwear,
it is not lounge-wear,

15:31.792 --> 15:34.583
and therefore is allowed at the school.

15:34.667 --> 15:36.083
Game, set...

15:36.166 --> 15:37.750
and match!

15:39.458 --> 15:41.709
You know, if you were a little dolphin,

15:42.250 --> 15:44.125
you'd be in a time-out right now.

15:44.917 --> 15:46.959
Oh, let me put this
in little dolphin talk.

15:47.375 --> 15:48.875
The kimono...

15:48.959 --> 15:50.709
Not a no-no.

15:52.792 --> 15:55.125
So, until tomorrow then?

15:55.458 --> 15:58.709
When Bob Duncan takes a trip
to the continent of Europe.

16:01.291 --> 16:02.750
Oh, do I have your attention?

16:05.583 --> 16:07.583
9upbeat music )

16:10.625 --> 16:12.834
Oh, Mrs. Lutes, hi! Um...

16:13.583 --> 16:18.500
If you have a second, I'd love to explain
what happened at my tryout.

16:18.583 --> 16:20.750
What happened was
you didn't make the team.

16:20.834 --> 16:25.000
I know. But do you know
why I didn't make the team?

16:25.250 --> 16:26.417
Because you were terrible?

16:27.458 --> 16:29.417
Okay, but do you know why I was terrible?

16:29.500 --> 16:30.750
Because you have no talent.

16:32.000 --> 16:33.083
Let's try a different tack.

16:33.166 --> 16:35.500
- Because you're uncoordinated.
- We're not doing that anymore!

16:37.125 --> 16:39.041
Look.

16:39.125 --> 16:41.625
Being on this team
is very important to me.

16:42.166 --> 16:45.667
In fact, it's always been a
dream of mine to be a cheerleader

16:45.750 --> 16:48.000
for the last half of my senior year.

16:49.792 --> 16:52.166
Well, seeing as we haven't
filled the spot,

16:52.667 --> 16:55.458
I'm gonna give you one more chance
to prove yourself.

16:55.709 --> 16:58.166
This time at a real sporting event.

16:58.250 --> 16:59.333
- Really?
- Mm-hm.

16:59.417 --> 17:00.667
Well, what is it?

17:00.917 --> 17:02.166
Volleyball?

17:02.250 --> 17:03.625
Basketball?

17:03.792 --> 17:05.625
Eh, not exactly.

17:06.583 --> 17:08.458
You can do it! Woo-hoo!

17:08.542 --> 17:10.041
Oh!

17:10.875 --> 17:12.625
Get it out! Get it out!

17:12.709 --> 17:14.583
All out!

17:17.750 --> 17:19.625
Way to go, way to be!

17:19.709 --> 17:21.834
I think we have an emergency!

17:27.709 --> 17:29.250
Are you guys not seeing this?

17:45.834 --> 17:47.041
Good morning, honey.

17:48.583 --> 17:50.083
You look beautiful today.

17:50.333 --> 17:51.500
So do you.

17:54.375 --> 17:55.291
So,

17:55.542 --> 17:57.333
wearing a skirt puts you
in a good mood, huh?

17:58.417 --> 17:59.667
It's not a skirt.

18:00.041 --> 18:01.834
It's a kilt!

18:03.709 --> 18:07.375
It's not sleepwear.
It's not lounge-wear and therefore...

18:07.667 --> 18:09.500
Is permitted at drop-off.

18:11.041 --> 18:13.959
Every day I fall in love with you
all over again.

18:15.959 --> 18:18.208
You know, yesterday
I told Director Emily...

18:18.500 --> 18:20.583
"The kimono not a no-no".

18:22.667 --> 18:24.542
I wonder what I'm gonna tell her today.

18:25.875 --> 18:28.917
Well, don't rack your brain.
Director Emily called.

18:29.667 --> 18:33.250
You and your international wardrobe
have been banned from the school.

18:33.709 --> 18:35.417
Oh! No, no, no!

18:35.667 --> 18:37.166
- This is not over.
- Yes, it is.

18:37.250 --> 18:39.375
No, it's not over until I say it's over.

18:39.709 --> 18:42.542
- I just said it's over.
- Well, okay. Now it's over.

18:46.667 --> 18:48.083
Shaved my legs for nothing.

18:56.375 --> 18:58.959
Hey, I've been meaning to thank
you for taking Toby to the park.

18:59.041 --> 19:00.250
Oh, no problem.

19:00.333 --> 19:01.542
There were no mishaps,

19:01.625 --> 19:03.000
nobody got lost.

19:03.083 --> 19:05.041
Three people left, three people came back.

19:06.333 --> 19:07.709
- The same three people.
- Yeah.

19:10.792 --> 19:12.834
Come here. Give your mother a hug.

19:13.875 --> 19:14.875
Oh.

19:14.959 --> 19:16.000
No, thanks.

19:17.333 --> 19:18.208
PJ...

19:18.291 --> 19:19.291
Hug.

19:19.375 --> 19:20.375
Now.

19:32.709 --> 19:34.333
Is there something you wanna tell me?

19:35.500 --> 19:36.375
No.

19:38.583 --> 19:39.458
PJ.

19:41.458 --> 19:43.041
I know you're wearing a swing.

19:45.792 --> 19:47.750
You know you're wearing a swing.

19:49.875 --> 19:51.750
Can we just be honest with each other?

19:53.875 --> 19:55.083
Or we could just...

19:55.792 --> 19:57.250
Pretend we don't know and...

19:57.792 --> 19:59.083
go about our day.

20:00.709 --> 20:02.291
Pretend we don't know?

20:03.417 --> 20:04.417
Okay.

20:06.458 --> 20:07.750
- Bye, mom!
- Bye, Sweetie.

20:16.500 --> 20:17.333
Teddy...

20:17.417 --> 20:19.583
I hear you did great
at the cross-country meet.

20:19.667 --> 20:21.709
That the runners loved you,
the fans loved you

20:21.792 --> 20:23.041
and so did the paramedics.

20:25.500 --> 20:27.542
So, am I on the team?

20:28.667 --> 20:29.583
Yes, you are.

20:31.875 --> 20:33.792
Woo-hoo!

20:33.875 --> 20:36.083
Hey, save some of that spirit for Ohio.

20:37.792 --> 20:40.375
I'm sorry, what?

20:40.583 --> 20:43.417
The cheerleading competition
is in Columbus, Ohio.

20:43.834 --> 20:45.667
The Big Apple of the Midwest.

20:46.625 --> 20:47.583
Ohio?

20:48.083 --> 20:49.709
You said Oahu!

20:49.875 --> 20:50.875
I did?

20:53.041 --> 20:55.375
I always mix those up.

20:55.709 --> 20:57.417
I'm such a cheerleader!

20:59.375 --> 21:01.375
Ohio. Not Oahu.

21:01.792 --> 21:04.250
I thought it was weird
we were taking the bus.

21:11.500 --> 21:12.625
Well, Charlie,

21:12.709 --> 21:14.625
I made fun of cheerleaders
all my life, and...

21:14.792 --> 21:16.500
now I am one.

21:17.125 --> 21:18.792
My reward...

21:19.166 --> 21:21.709
27 hours on a bus.

21:23.291 --> 21:25.291
Go, Teddy!

21:26.333 --> 21:30.166
To pass the time, Kelsey and I will be
working on this puzzle.

21:31.166 --> 21:34.917
She's gonna learn where the states are
and how to pronounce them.

21:37.375 --> 21:38.709
- PJ!
- Huh?

21:41.375 --> 21:42.375
Hi, there.

21:43.083 --> 21:44.166
Uh,

21:44.667 --> 21:46.083
I see you got the baby swing off.

21:46.166 --> 21:47.083
Yes, I did.

21:48.625 --> 21:50.458
- Make any new bets?
- Yes, I did.

21:58.083 --> 22:00.041
That's your gene pool.

22:01.834 --> 22:02.792
Good luck, Charlie.

22:07.625 --> 22:08.625
How about this?

22:09.041 --> 22:11.875
I bet you, you can't throw this pine cone,

22:12.375 --> 22:14.667
- have it hit that street sign,
- Uh-huh.

22:14.917 --> 22:16.333
ricochet off the bird's nest,

22:16.709 --> 22:18.834
knock the glass out of that lady's hands,

22:19.333 --> 22:20.125
carom off the cat,

22:20.667 --> 22:22.250
have it bounce off the trampoline,

22:22.375 --> 22:23.875
and then hit the giant in the head.

22:24.792 --> 22:25.667
Question.

22:26.542 --> 22:28.333
Why is there a giant in the park?

22:30.208 --> 22:31.333
Do you want the bet or not?

22:33.250 --> 22:34.250
Cone me.

22:34.333 --> 22:35.625
All right.

22:37.750 --> 22:39.208
Yeah!

22:44.834 --> 22:45.667
Yeah!

22:45.917 --> 22:47.125
Woo! I got it!

22:47.625 --> 22:48.625
Huh.

22:48.709 --> 22:50.625
- I gotta say, that was a heck of a shot.
- Yeah.

22:51.917 --> 22:53.083
Both: Oh...

22:57.125 --> 23:00.917
I am not the guy
you wanna be messing with.
