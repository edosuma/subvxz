01:12.407 --> 01:14.216
Morning, Gordon.

01:15.927 --> 01:17.133
Nice day, huh?

01:26.247 --> 01:29.296
Hurry up, Bucky. Jeez, slow poke.

01:30.167 --> 01:32.295
I'm going as fast as I can, Clint.
No fooling.

01:32.447 --> 01:34.734
I see you're trying
the Cool Ranch Doritos today.

01:35.367 --> 01:39.372
You spoke so highly of them,
I figured I'd give them a whirl.

01:39.527 --> 01:42.531
They should be their own food group.
No fooling, they're that good.

01:42.687 --> 01:44.815
Tell her your life story,
why don't you?

01:44.967 --> 01:47.573
No, I was just commenting
on the Doritos.

01:47.727 --> 01:48.967
Are you sassing me?

01:49.447 --> 01:50.573
No, no, he was just--

01:50.727 --> 01:53.936
He don't need a lawyer,
Mrs. Bozobop.

01:54.087 --> 01:56.328
Come on. Let's get on.

01:56.487 --> 02:00.173
The way we've been meaning to get on
ever since you started bagging here.

02:04.247 --> 02:06.090
You hit me in the eye!

02:07.327 --> 02:10.536
What? No, Clint, you hit yourself.
I saw you.

02:10.687 --> 02:11.893
You've gone Ioony.

02:12.047 --> 02:14.015
You get out of here. You're fired.

02:14.167 --> 02:16.932
- Fired?
- Yeah. Go on!

02:22.367 --> 02:25.655
I'm so sorry I got you in trouble,
Bucky.

02:25.807 --> 02:28.651
I shouldn't have distracted you
from your job.

02:29.167 --> 02:32.376
Mrs. Bozobop,
this has nothing to do with you.

02:32.527 --> 02:35.656
It is an honour
to have you as my last bag.

02:37.047 --> 02:40.130
And I meant what I said about
the Cool Ranch. They're so good....

02:40.887 --> 02:42.730
Oh, listen to me, Bucky.

02:43.847 --> 02:46.453
Don't let these people
get you down.

02:46.607 --> 02:48.974
I can feel it in my bones.

02:49.527 --> 02:51.848
You're destined for greatness.

03:06.247 --> 03:08.011
Oh, jeez, Bucky.

03:08.167 --> 03:11.376
I haven't seen you this down
since they cancelled Jericho.

03:11.887 --> 03:15.687
You know,
that Clint guy is just a little off.

03:16.887 --> 03:20.289
I was repairing the soles of his loafers,
and I'm not Lying...

03:20.447 --> 03:21.687
...he's got six toes.

03:22.887 --> 03:25.333
- Now, get right out of town.
- No joke.

03:25.487 --> 03:28.616
No. I saw the outline
right there in the shoe.

03:29.647 --> 03:32.014
I think his dad
was some sort of an amphibian.

03:37.287 --> 03:39.972
Jeremiah, shame on you!

03:40.127 --> 03:42.733
Pop, you had me going
real good there.

03:44.327 --> 03:47.171
- He sure did.
- See, you're feeling better already, hon.

03:47.327 --> 03:48.738
I bet it's that new haircut.

03:48.887 --> 03:51.538
I've been getting a lot
of compliments on it. Thanks, Mom.

03:51.687 --> 03:54.338
Oh, don't thank me. Thank the bowl.

03:54.487 --> 03:56.649
Mrs. Bozobop said
I look like Brad Pitt.

03:56.807 --> 03:59.378
Yeah, you do look like
kind of the Legends of the Fall...

03:59.527 --> 04:01.734
...with the hair working there.

04:01.887 --> 04:04.015
What do you say we adjourn
to the living room...

04:04.167 --> 04:06.329
- ...and play some Yahtzee?
- That's a good idea.

04:06.487 --> 04:07.977
Oh, actually....

04:08.127 --> 04:10.858
Mom, I'm gonna go over
to Dale's tonight.

04:12.327 --> 04:14.898
Okay, I just thought
you loved the Yahtz.

04:15.047 --> 04:17.288
I do. It's just Rory said
they've got some movie...

04:17.447 --> 04:19.176
...that will turn my frown
upside down.

04:19.567 --> 04:22.730
Yeah, you know, it's good
to have friends when times are tough.

04:22.887 --> 04:24.696
I want you to wear
your bright sneakers...

04:24.847 --> 04:26.656
...so the cars can see you.

04:26.807 --> 04:29.048
Already on, Pop.

04:30.487 --> 04:32.171
Look at him dancing. Like a rapper.

04:53.607 --> 04:55.689
Here he comes.
We gotta cheer him up.

04:55.847 --> 04:58.327
- Hi, Buck.
- Hey, what's the word, Big Bird?

04:59.167 --> 05:01.056
Hey, Dale, what is that,
a robot head?

05:01.207 --> 05:02.538
I wish.

05:02.687 --> 05:05.896
It's my parents' old projector.
We used to watch home movies on it.

05:06.047 --> 05:10.018
But tonight, we're gonna use it
to watch nude movies.

05:11.487 --> 05:13.535
- Nude?
- A skin-filmer.

05:13.687 --> 05:16.611
One of those movies
you can play with your business to.

05:16.767 --> 05:19.213
Play with your busi....
Business what?

05:19.367 --> 05:20.607
Don't you twang your wang?

05:21.047 --> 05:24.176
If that means washing my ween,
then yeah, it's an every-dayer.

05:24.607 --> 05:27.690
You know, "Up, down, all around,
do it again if I see some brown."

05:29.567 --> 05:31.331
No, it means rubbing
your skin flute...

05:31.487 --> 05:35.048
...after it gets stiff
from seeing a pair of love balloons.

05:37.167 --> 05:38.737
Nope. Can't say I've done that.

05:38.887 --> 05:41.254
- You are fibbing!
- No way!

05:41.407 --> 05:44.411
Jeez, Bucky, I build my day
around the whack.

05:44.567 --> 05:47.298
I get in a breakfast flapjack,
a nooner...

05:47.447 --> 05:51.338
...an after-lunch, pre-nap slap,
a post-work, traffic-jam slam...

05:51.487 --> 05:54.138
...a pre-dinner spinner,
an after-dinner dink...

05:54.287 --> 05:55.527
...a dog-walk leash-pull...

05:55.687 --> 05:58.258
...and then I round it out
with a midnight snack-whack...

05:58.407 --> 05:59.852
...if my folks are asleep.

06:00.007 --> 06:01.850
Sometimes I do it
at the dinner table.

06:02.007 --> 06:04.931
I'm not gonna lie, Bucky.
I've been choking the bald man...

06:05.087 --> 06:08.011
...the whole time Lars was telling you
his pud-pulling schedule.

06:09.287 --> 06:11.415
Pocket patty-cake!

06:12.807 --> 06:15.538
Jeez. You guys spend
a lot of time on this.

06:15.687 --> 06:16.768
Is it really that fun?

06:16.927 --> 06:18.497
Better than "Donkey Kong."

06:18.647 --> 06:20.251
Now, get right out of town.

06:23.487 --> 06:24.488
Okay.

06:24.647 --> 06:26.888
So how do you do it, this....
What is it, whacking?

06:27.047 --> 06:29.778
It's a breeze. We'll walk you
through it, step by step.

06:29.927 --> 06:32.498
We'll even kill the lights,
So you can have your privacy.

06:32.647 --> 06:35.571
But you know what? We'll put on
the old Billy Squier black light...

06:35.727 --> 06:37.138
...so you can see your business.

06:39.167 --> 06:41.773
Jeez, guys, thanks a lot
for helping me out here.

06:41.927 --> 06:44.976
Hey, we wouldn't be your friends
if we didn't.

06:45.127 --> 06:47.812
Now, jump in the big bean.

06:47.967 --> 06:49.128
All right.

06:57.447 --> 07:00.417
Now you're gonna see
some sexy stuff in the movie.

07:00.567 --> 07:03.650
Stuff that's gonna inflate
your fun-tool.

07:05.007 --> 07:07.169
Like hot-buttered yaboes.

07:07.327 --> 07:09.295
I got a feeling
this is gonna be a doozy.

07:09.447 --> 07:11.529
So pop a button
and go ankles on your trousers.

07:11.687 --> 07:13.416
You're gonna wanna
be ready, Bucky.

07:16.927 --> 07:18.133
We should put down a tarp.

07:18.287 --> 07:20.335
Could be a flood when he blows.

07:20.967 --> 07:23.049
Just finished baling the hay.

07:23.207 --> 07:25.369
Need me to put the pitchfork
anywhere else?

07:25.527 --> 07:27.052
How's it going up there, Bucky?

07:27.207 --> 07:29.608
Not sure. I'm catching some air
off my wrinkle-bag.

07:29.767 --> 07:32.498
- Is that what we're looking for?
- One hundred percent, Bucky.

07:32.647 --> 07:34.729
That's called liftoff.

07:34.887 --> 07:36.651
Okay.

07:38.447 --> 07:41.496
Bucky, grab your joystick.
The game's about to begin.

07:41.647 --> 07:44.412
- Okay, one hand or two?
- No, just the one.

07:44.567 --> 07:45.807
Keep your other hand free...

07:45.967 --> 07:47.776
...in case you wanna tap
on your dirt button.

07:47.927 --> 07:49.577
Okay.

07:49.727 --> 07:52.298
Forget your dirt button!
Just ice-pick it, Bucky!

07:52.447 --> 07:54.097
Grab at it and really go to town!

07:59.847 --> 08:02.373
Up and down, like a pogo stick!

08:03.887 --> 08:06.538
Am I doing It now? Am I a whacker?

08:06.687 --> 08:08.291
You're a whacking machine!

08:11.687 --> 08:13.610
Is that who I think it is?

08:14.287 --> 08:16.176
How does that feel?

08:16.327 --> 08:18.250
You know,
that's got a real kick to it, hon.

08:18.407 --> 08:20.375
Just like a donkey.

08:24.007 --> 08:26.374
That's your folks.

08:26.527 --> 08:27.972
One hundred percent.

08:28.127 --> 08:29.617
By golly.

08:29.767 --> 08:31.132
Oh, my!

08:31.287 --> 08:33.448
Jeez, that's weird.

08:39.167 --> 08:41.613
That's my folks.

08:41.767 --> 08:44.338
On the big screen.

08:44.487 --> 08:47.058
I think that's pretty dang cool,
Bucky.

08:51.727 --> 08:52.728
Hi, Buck.

08:52.887 --> 08:54.935
I knew you couldn't resist
the Yahtzee.

08:55.087 --> 08:58.091
So you finished the movie already?

09:01.447 --> 09:03.529
I bet acting is fun.

09:07.367 --> 09:09.938
But it's gotta be weird
having a camera pointed at you...

09:10.087 --> 09:11.930
...don't you think, Pop?

09:12.967 --> 09:15.095
Probably not that weird.

09:16.807 --> 09:18.616
I bet you couldn't do it.

09:18.767 --> 09:20.337
Oh, I bet you I could.

09:21.047 --> 09:22.458
I bet you couldn't...

09:22.607 --> 09:24.097
...if you're nude!

09:24.967 --> 09:27.971
Jim Spraysium and Rosie Bush!

09:32.647 --> 09:34.570
How'd you know about that?

09:34.727 --> 09:36.411
I saw it.

09:36.567 --> 09:38.888
I didn't even know
you were a farmer, Pop.

09:40.287 --> 09:42.893
We were gonna tell you
on your 50th birthday...

09:43.047 --> 09:45.288
...but I guess
you stumbled on it early.

09:45.447 --> 09:47.449
- You made all of these?
- Sure did.

09:47.607 --> 09:51.134
- Eighty-six, to be exact.
- Jeez. I mean....

09:51.287 --> 09:52.777
How the heck did you get into it?

09:53.447 --> 09:54.494
Well...

09:54.647 --> 09:57.776
...one day, your mother says,
"I wanna see the ocean."

09:57.927 --> 10:02.615
Sol rented a van and, well,
we went out there to California.

10:02.767 --> 10:05.088
Anyway, we're taking a walk
on the beach.

10:05.647 --> 10:07.297
So we threw down a beach towel...

10:07.447 --> 10:10.178
...and we start a pretty mean session
of kissy-face.

10:10.967 --> 10:13.891
And then, out of nowhere,
an older gentleman comes up...

10:14.047 --> 10:16.288
...and says
we look good smooching.

10:16.447 --> 10:19.018
And he said he made movies
about people doing the stuff...

10:19.167 --> 10:20.817
- ...that we were doing.
- Yeah...

10:20.967 --> 10:24.414
...and he said that we had
a natural look and technique.

10:24.567 --> 10:26.410
He said it was our destiny.

10:27.367 --> 10:31.691
When someone says
it's your destiny, you listen up.

10:34.687 --> 10:36.735
Old Mrs. Bozobop said
I had a destiny earlier.

10:37.607 --> 10:40.975
Well, sure you do.
Everybody does, Bucky.

10:41.127 --> 10:42.253
Yeah, but this is it.

10:43.407 --> 10:44.932
What's it?

10:45.087 --> 10:47.089
This is why I was fired.

10:47.247 --> 10:48.533
This is my destiny.

10:48.687 --> 10:50.530
I was born to be a star.

10:50.887 --> 10:53.493
Oh, I don't know about that, Bucky.

10:53.647 --> 10:55.968
I mean, it's not an easy life.

10:56.127 --> 10:59.529
It's filled with long days
and lots of chafing.

11:00.167 --> 11:02.488
I ain't afraid of chafing.
I ain't afraid of nothing.

11:02.647 --> 11:05.935
I'm gonna go to California and I'm
gonna be a star on the silver screen.

11:06.087 --> 11:07.612
I'm the son of two movie stars.

11:07.767 --> 11:11.772
That's like a super-duper
movie star.

11:12.167 --> 11:15.091
- Buck!
- No. Let him go, dear.

11:19.847 --> 11:23.090
I love you so much. I'm gonna call you
right when I get there, I promise.

11:23.247 --> 11:24.692
- You better.
- All right.

11:24.847 --> 11:26.258
- All right, son.
- Bye.

11:29.287 --> 11:31.415
There goes our boy, Jeremiah.

11:31.567 --> 11:32.807
Give them heck, son!

11:50.047 --> 11:52.049
No way.

11:53.287 --> 11:55.051
Pop.

12:23.047 --> 12:25.095
- Take care.
- Be safe, Bucky.

12:27.047 --> 12:28.856
Bye, Piggies.

13:12.487 --> 13:13.568
Hey, how are you?

13:16.047 --> 13:17.537
We don't sell kiddie porn, man.

13:17.967 --> 13:19.935
Oh, I'm allergic to cats.

13:23.367 --> 13:26.257
Self-service, pal. Don't see
what you want, just do some laps...

13:26.407 --> 13:30.093
- ...until something gives you a boner.
- No, I don't wanna buy a movie.

13:30.247 --> 13:33.376
I wanna be in one. Let's go.

13:34.247 --> 13:35.294
We just sell the porn.

13:35.447 --> 13:37.973
If you wanna make it,
you have to go to the Valley.

13:38.127 --> 13:39.538
No way.

13:39.687 --> 13:41.451
Is that far?

13:41.607 --> 13:44.497
We just-- The bus went through
a valley in Colorado. Was that it?

13:44.647 --> 13:46.456
- Did I miss it?
- No.

13:46.607 --> 13:48.450
Just go over the hill.

13:48.607 --> 13:49.893
Take Laurel Canyon.

13:50.047 --> 13:51.492
All right, good. Thanks.

13:51.647 --> 13:52.978
How are you doing?

13:53.127 --> 13:54.731
All right. It's hot out.

13:55.287 --> 13:57.608
Fart in my mouth! Fart in my mouth!

13:57.767 --> 14:01.294
Fart in my mouth! Fart in my mouth!

14:03.167 --> 14:04.657
Hi, how are you?

14:05.687 --> 14:09.772
Yeah, good day.
Yeah, good day to you. All right.

14:11.687 --> 14:12.973
Hi, all right.

14:44.447 --> 14:46.256
Hey, what's your soup today?

14:47.727 --> 14:50.651
Split pea with rice and broccoli.

14:50.807 --> 14:52.969
That sounds good.
I'll have a bowl of that.

14:54.047 --> 14:55.458
And some braces?

14:56.007 --> 14:59.932
And maybe a haircut?
And a new shirt? God.

15:00.647 --> 15:02.058
Kathy, I'm going on break.

15:02.207 --> 15:04.892
Bring a bowl of soup
to Bugs Bunny at the counter.

15:05.447 --> 15:07.768
Marge, you just went on break.

15:11.527 --> 15:13.928
I'll get that soup over to you
right away.

15:19.207 --> 15:20.618
My name's Kathy, by the way...

15:20.767 --> 15:23.134
...so if you need anything,
just holler.

15:24.007 --> 15:27.614
Okay. I'm Hucky.
Boiler at me if you need spazzing.

15:28.847 --> 15:30.212
Okay.

15:39.847 --> 15:41.451
I need you to clean up
the bathrooms.

15:42.087 --> 15:44.169
Oh, it's Marge's night
to clean the bathrooms.

15:44.327 --> 15:45.374
Marge had to leave sick.

15:45.527 --> 15:46.972
Why are you being so difficult?

15:47.127 --> 15:48.492
Marge has a hard life.

15:49.367 --> 15:51.529
Marge has got hairy ears
just like a tarantula.

15:51.687 --> 15:53.257
And she's ugly as shit.

15:53.407 --> 15:56.013
Show some compassion,
would you?

15:56.167 --> 15:57.976
Okay.

16:00.007 --> 16:02.374
I didn't know we had rats over here.

16:04.887 --> 16:08.175
Do you want me to clean
the bathrooms for you? I can.

16:08.327 --> 16:10.853
No, it's sweet of you to offer,
but I can do it.

16:11.807 --> 16:13.696
All right. Let me know.

16:14.127 --> 16:15.538
I love that accent.

16:15.687 --> 16:19.089
- Are you from the Midwest?
- Yeah! Iowa.

16:19.247 --> 16:21.249
Good guess.

16:21.807 --> 16:23.047
Are you here on vacation...

16:23.207 --> 16:25.289
...or did you come here
to become a movie star?

16:25.447 --> 16:27.017
A movie star.

16:27.167 --> 16:28.453
Do you have mind powers?

16:29.447 --> 16:32.929
No, just root-beer-float powers.

16:38.887 --> 16:40.048
Hey

16:41.287 --> 16:43.608
- I have a question.
- Okay.

16:44.327 --> 16:46.091
Are there any stars here?

16:46.247 --> 16:48.978
Because it says
"Tony's Famous Diner" on the sign...

16:49.127 --> 16:51.733
...but I haven't recognised anyone.

16:52.847 --> 16:55.168
Yeah. Play it cool.

16:55.687 --> 16:57.610
I'm not supposed to say this...

16:57.767 --> 17:00.168
...but the guy behind you,
on your left...

17:01.447 --> 17:03.688
...was Chewbacca in Star Wars.

17:03.847 --> 17:06.976
- What? He was Chewbacca?
- Yes.

17:07.207 --> 17:09.289
I love Star Wars.

17:09.686 --> 17:12.166
- On my left?
- Yeah.

17:27.287 --> 17:30.097
Oh, my God. He looks just like him.

18:16.127 --> 18:18.255
Midwest,
what are you doing in there?

18:18.407 --> 18:21.570
Munching on this chocolate Frisbee,
doing some Mad Libs.

18:21.727 --> 18:23.297
I see that.

18:23.447 --> 18:25.609
Why are you doing it in the bushes?

18:25.767 --> 18:28.008
I actually thought I'd setup camp
in here tonight.

18:28.167 --> 18:29.373
It's actually kind of warm.

18:30.767 --> 18:33.134
You don't have any place to stay?

18:33.287 --> 18:36.336
No. I just got to town,
so I don't really know anybody yet.

18:36.487 --> 18:39.696
But it's fine. I was a Cub Scout,
so I can make do.

18:40.927 --> 18:42.770
Bucky, get out of the bushes.

18:42.927 --> 18:45.134
Come on,
it's not a nice neighbourhood.

18:46.087 --> 18:49.296
There's a guy at my apartment building
who's been looking for a roommate.

18:49.447 --> 18:51.415
Let's go see
if the room's still available.

18:51.567 --> 18:55.333
And, you know, if not,
we've got much nicer bushes.

18:55.487 --> 18:57.296
All right, sounds like a plan.

18:58.527 --> 19:00.211
So you live here your whole life?

19:00.367 --> 19:03.769
No, I grew up in New Jersey.
I moved here after high school.

19:03.927 --> 19:05.338
You went to high school?

19:05.487 --> 19:09.014
- Yeah, you didn't go?
- No, my town didn't have one.

19:10.487 --> 19:13.889
So, what kind of movies
you wanna do? Comedy, drama?

19:14.047 --> 19:15.378
Nude.

19:15.927 --> 19:17.611
So comedy.

19:18.287 --> 19:20.176
No, full-on nude. My folks did it.

19:20.327 --> 19:21.738
Cross my heart.

19:22.487 --> 19:24.569
Well, that's awesome. Awesome.

19:24.727 --> 19:25.933
- Thanks.
- Here we are.

19:26.087 --> 19:27.532
Home, sweet home.

19:27.687 --> 19:29.257
Your bushes are super nice.

19:29.407 --> 19:30.897
Yeah, they're nice.

19:31.047 --> 19:34.210
I hope he's still awake.
It is kind of late.

19:37.687 --> 19:39.689
Hey, Gary, I'm sorry to bother you.

19:39.847 --> 19:41.929
I wanted to see
if you have that room for rent.

19:42.087 --> 19:43.498
So are we gonna do this or not?

19:44.207 --> 19:45.697
Yeah. Yeah.

19:45.847 --> 19:49.454
Well, you can tell him
that Gary said to eat my shit.

19:49.847 --> 19:51.212
Yeah, totally.

19:51.367 --> 19:53.131
You wanna move your stuff
in tonight?

19:53.287 --> 19:54.891
No. No, it's not for me.

19:55.047 --> 19:57.448
It's for my friend Bucky here.
I'm still up In 44.

19:58.447 --> 20:00.176
How are you doing? Bucky Larson.

20:00.327 --> 20:01.613
What line of work are you in?

20:01.767 --> 20:03.929
I'm here to be a movie star.

20:04.087 --> 20:07.455
My last roommate came here to be a
rock star then skipped town, that fuck.

20:07.607 --> 20:09.132
Owes me three months rent.

20:09.287 --> 20:11.051
Fuck you, John Mayer.

20:11.207 --> 20:13.938
Wait, no. I got the dough.
I'm good for it.

20:15.727 --> 20:19.174
- Can you excuse us for a minute?
- Yeah, sure.

20:19.887 --> 20:22.174
And don't leave.
I'd like to say goodbye.

20:22.727 --> 20:24.331
Okay.

20:27.367 --> 20:29.369
Look, I don't know you
and I don't know Kathy.

20:29.527 --> 20:31.655
I've seen her in the laundry room
a few times...

20:31.807 --> 20:34.378
...but that doesn't mean I trust her.
I trust her tits.

20:35.447 --> 20:36.937
Okay.

20:37.247 --> 20:39.898
I'm gonna let you have the room
because I know you got cash.

20:40.047 --> 20:43.210
And I know I could pound
those woodcutters down your throat.

20:44.127 --> 20:45.731
Why are you being weird
about that?

20:45.887 --> 20:48.652
- I'm not. It's fine. Whatever you want.
- Yeah, no fucking shit.

20:49.927 --> 20:51.770
You can have the bathroom
off the hallway.

20:51.927 --> 20:54.373
Don't use the one in my room.
That's my sanctuary.

20:54.527 --> 20:56.894
- Roommates?
- Yeah, roommates.

20:59.927 --> 21:02.373
- Good.
- Great seeing you again, Kathy...

21:02.527 --> 21:05.451
...and if you ever wanna hang out
by the pool, let me know.

21:05.607 --> 21:07.052
Okay.

21:07.527 --> 21:10.212
- Good night, Bucky.
- Good night, Kathy.

21:37.607 --> 21:39.132
All right.

21:54.567 --> 21:57.093
I could do this all day, bird...

21:57.247 --> 21:59.648
...but I gotta go and take this town
by the antlers.

22:04.327 --> 22:05.613
What the fuck?

22:05.767 --> 22:07.690
- I'm sorry.
- Shut the door!

22:07.847 --> 22:09.417
You said this was my bathroom.

22:09.567 --> 22:10.978
It is! But I shit here!

22:11.127 --> 22:13.368
I can't shit where I shower!
Shut the fucking door!

22:13.527 --> 22:14.972
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

22:15.127 --> 22:17.448
You better not be a psycho!

22:20.327 --> 22:23.058
Sorry. We got a new intern
out here at our office.

22:29.287 --> 22:30.732
Bucky.

22:30.887 --> 22:33.697
Why are you brushing your teeth
in the pool?

22:34.927 --> 22:36.497
There's a problem
with my bathroom.

22:36.647 --> 22:38.649
There's gonna be a problem
in your stomach...

22:38.807 --> 22:40.889
...if you keep using that water.

22:47.207 --> 22:49.448
- Thanks for the warning.
- Yeah.

22:50.287 --> 22:52.813
I'm off to work.
Good luck being nude today.

22:52.967 --> 22:54.571
Okay. Say hi to Chewbacca.

22:54.727 --> 22:56.729
Okay.

23:02.887 --> 23:05.891
Free snake? No, thanks.

23:09.007 --> 23:12.807
"Actors wanted.
Open call audition."

23:18.127 --> 23:19.208
Bucky Larson.

23:29.527 --> 23:31.814
This is Bucky Larson.

23:34.767 --> 23:36.576
Do you have a headshot?

23:38.247 --> 23:39.851
Like a shot of my head or what?

23:40.567 --> 23:42.456
Yeah.

23:44.007 --> 23:45.930
Yeah, wait.

23:48.007 --> 23:49.293
I got a picture here of me.

23:49.447 --> 23:52.371
That's me on the left. You can just
fold it and get the head part.

23:53.727 --> 23:55.217
Your accent's awesome, man.

23:55.367 --> 23:57.654
I like the Midwest choice.
And that vest is amazing.

23:57.807 --> 23:59.650
Oh, thanks.
My mom made it for me.

24:02.647 --> 24:04.331
This isn't a proper headshot.

24:04.487 --> 24:07.297
Who cares?
Come on, this guy's great.

24:07.447 --> 24:08.608
Don't be such a buzz-kill.

24:08.767 --> 24:10.849
Are you familiar with Redondi
Mac and Cheese?

24:11.007 --> 24:12.611
Oh, Yeah. That's my favourite.

24:12.767 --> 24:15.054
My mom makes it every Tuesday
for Boggle night.

24:15.207 --> 24:16.288
I love your slogan.

24:16.447 --> 24:18.495
Eat Redondi
Fill your belly

24:18.647 --> 24:20.251
Monday through Sunday

24:20.407 --> 24:23.968
That's perfect. My name is Claudio
and I'll be directing this commercial.

24:24.127 --> 24:25.367
We're gonna put you on tape.

24:25.527 --> 24:27.928
- Did you get to peep the script?
- Peep?

24:30.047 --> 24:31.128
Peep?

24:31.287 --> 24:33.733
Screw it. We'll do a cold read.
You're a pro.

24:35.047 --> 24:36.173
Owen, press record.

24:36.967 --> 24:38.378
And Bucky, go for it.

24:38.527 --> 24:40.211
Okay.

24:44.087 --> 24:46.533
- Holy shit!
- Fuck, man, what are you doing?

24:46.687 --> 24:48.212
No, no, no!

24:48.367 --> 24:49.448
Did I whack it right?

24:49.607 --> 24:51.609
- Stop the camera! Stop it!
- Oh, my God.

24:51.767 --> 24:53.417
Oh, my God, he's going for his butt!

24:56.167 --> 24:58.568
- Get out of here, you pervert!
- Get the fuck out!

24:58.727 --> 25:00.491
Did I get the part?

25:06.327 --> 25:07.692
Hey.

25:07.847 --> 25:11.010
Hey, man. Pull your pants up.

25:11.167 --> 25:12.817
What the fuck is your problem?

25:12.967 --> 25:16.130
I don't know. I was doing what the guys
in the neighbourhood told me to.

25:16.287 --> 25:18.415
So this is a dare,
some YouTube bullshit?

25:18.567 --> 25:21.411
No. I wanna be a movie star,
like my folks.

25:21.567 --> 25:23.569
They were on camera
and they were nude.

25:23.727 --> 25:25.650
And they helped people.

25:25.807 --> 25:29.368
- Who the hell were your parents?
- Rosie Bush and Jim Spraysium.

25:29.527 --> 25:31.211
The porn stars from the '70s?

25:31.367 --> 25:33.415
- Are you serious?
- Yeah, for sure.

25:33.567 --> 25:35.331
Look at the picture.

25:35.927 --> 25:37.452
Holy shit, that is them.

25:38.487 --> 25:39.534
Rosie Bush.

25:39.687 --> 25:41.928
Damn, her bush sure was rosy.

25:42.087 --> 25:44.533
That explains it, how you got
that thick Midwest accent.

25:44.687 --> 25:46.052
I don't have an accent.

25:47.767 --> 25:50.054
So you seriously wanna do porn?

25:50.207 --> 25:52.972
You can't whip your dick out
at mac-and-cheese commercials.

25:53.127 --> 25:54.652
You'll go to jail.

25:54.807 --> 25:55.968
I don't wanna go to jail.

25:58.207 --> 26:00.494
When I started out,
I used to direct some porno.

26:00.647 --> 26:03.218
A lot of directors do it.
There's nothing weird about it.

26:03.367 --> 26:05.608
My boy Dick Shadow's
having a house party tonight.

26:05.767 --> 26:07.769
You can make
a lot of connections there.

26:07.927 --> 26:09.929
People will trip meeting the son
of Rosie and Jim.

26:10.087 --> 26:12.488
- A trip out?
- Do you wanna roll with me?

26:12.647 --> 26:14.411
Yeah, I'll roll with you.

26:14.647 --> 26:16.331
Actually,
I'm glad you wanna do porn.

26:16.487 --> 26:19.172
At first, I thought you had some weird
mac-and-cheese fetish.

26:19.327 --> 26:21.853
No, I don't use fetish cheese.
I use Velveeta.

26:23.687 --> 26:26.816
Oh, you can't go this way.
They probably called the cops.

26:30.247 --> 26:32.136
I've never ridden
in a convertible before.

26:32.287 --> 26:34.688
This is something else.

26:34.847 --> 26:37.771
Get the full experience, man.
Stand up, feel the breeze.

26:38.447 --> 26:40.927
- Are you serious?
- Yeah, buddy.

26:53.767 --> 26:57.488
Holy cow! That was wild, man.

27:00.327 --> 27:03.331
Bucky,
I think you've got bugs in your teeth.

27:03.487 --> 27:05.057
- No.
- You wanna scrape those off...

27:05.207 --> 27:08.256
- ...before you get to the party.
- Oh, it's still moving!

27:10.927 --> 27:14.568
This is the joint, Bucky,
the hardest, horniest party in town.

27:14.727 --> 27:17.458
If you wanna be in the porn world,
you got to know the Shadow.

27:17.607 --> 27:19.177
Shadows are so mysterious.

27:19.327 --> 27:20.533
What's up, Ricky?

27:20.687 --> 27:23.054
- What's up, guys?
- Where are you going, crackhead?

27:23.207 --> 27:25.448
Yo, guys, he's cool. He's with me.

27:27.487 --> 27:29.330
Your hands are like a bear trap.

27:29.487 --> 27:31.694
- Any cameras or weapons?
- No, I don't--

27:31.847 --> 27:33.133
Cool. Don't bite anybody.

27:35.887 --> 27:38.572
Hi, how are you? Good to see you.

27:38.767 --> 27:41.737
- Claudio.
- Hey

27:44.447 --> 27:46.688
Hey, guys. How are you? Having fun?

27:51.327 --> 27:52.408
Sushi?

27:52.567 --> 27:55.855
"Sushi"? Is that with an "S"?

27:56.007 --> 27:58.931
Sushi. All right.

27:59.087 --> 28:01.135
Oh, it smells like--

28:04.247 --> 28:06.249
Do you want some sushi?

28:33.607 --> 28:36.929
No, thank you! No, thank you!

28:41.687 --> 28:44.657
So, Dick Shadow.
Is that a family name?

28:45.287 --> 28:47.130
Because it sounds like a superhero.

28:49.447 --> 28:52.257
Well, in many ways,
I am a superhero.

28:53.727 --> 28:55.968
Yeah, when I was a boy...

28:56.127 --> 28:58.573
...I was 12 or so,
I was playing out in the fields.

29:00.247 --> 29:02.978
The sun was so bright that day.

29:04.487 --> 29:07.058
I was wearing these baggy shorts.

29:07.207 --> 29:08.777
A bee flew up my trousers.

29:08.927 --> 29:10.691
Oh, my God.

29:10.847 --> 29:11.848
Yeah.

29:12.007 --> 29:13.611
Sol panicked, right?

29:13.767 --> 29:16.008
I took off my shorts
as fast as I could.

29:16.407 --> 29:18.409
I stood there naked
from the waist down.

29:19.127 --> 29:20.413
Well, where did the bee go?

29:21.287 --> 29:23.051
Doesn't matter. He flew away.

29:23.207 --> 29:25.255
But as I stood there...

29:25.407 --> 29:29.492
...the wind blowing and the sun
beating down on my manhood...

29:30.287 --> 29:33.211
...I saw a shadow before me.

29:34.687 --> 29:36.337
It was gigantic.

29:38.527 --> 29:40.894
Then I looked over
to the neighbourhood girls.

29:41.047 --> 29:42.776
And their mothers.

29:42.927 --> 29:45.407
And they were standing there
in awe of my shadow.

29:46.607 --> 29:49.417
And that's when
Randy Dooley died...

29:49.607 --> 29:52.178
...and Dick Shadow was born.

29:53.207 --> 29:55.972
Nothing grows in my cock shade.

29:56.127 --> 29:57.288
Nothing.

29:57.927 --> 29:59.133
Oh, yeah.

29:59.287 --> 30:00.493
Yeah. Yeah.

30:01.607 --> 30:03.530
Claudio. My man.

30:03.687 --> 30:05.052
Dick Shadow.

30:05.207 --> 30:07.369
Hey.
Ladies, why don't you take a break?

30:08.167 --> 30:09.851
Give me a second
with my buddy here.

30:10.887 --> 30:13.891
There's somebody I want you to meet.
You'll get a kick out of this.

30:14.047 --> 30:16.891
Do you remember
Rosie Bush and Jim Spraysium?

30:17.047 --> 30:21.928
Yeah, I think so. Married couple
from the '70s, talked like retards...

30:22.087 --> 30:25.296
- ...never shaved?
- Yeah. This is their son.

30:25.447 --> 30:26.892
He wants to get into porn.

30:27.047 --> 30:28.492
Really?

30:29.487 --> 30:32.058
So, what do you want to do?
You wanna be a lighting guy...

30:32.207 --> 30:33.368
...or a fluffer?

30:33.527 --> 30:35.370
No, a star.

30:36.647 --> 30:38.411
Okay.

30:38.647 --> 30:40.649
Well, let's see what you got.

30:41.607 --> 30:43.097
Here I go.

30:43.647 --> 30:46.127
I got about two bucks
and some Bazooka Joes.

30:46.287 --> 30:48.016
It's a little warm, but it's chewable.

30:49.047 --> 30:51.175
No, no. Let's see your stuff.

30:52.087 --> 30:55.216
Oh, my-- My stuffs in my apartment.
Was I supposed to bring it?

30:55.367 --> 30:57.369
No, your junk, kid. Whip it out.

30:57.527 --> 31:00.815
Your dick, Bucky. Pull down your
pants. That's what he's talking about.

31:02.687 --> 31:04.974
- Oh, my....
- Yeah.

31:05.487 --> 31:06.932
Yeah.

31:17.287 --> 31:19.335
Very impressive.

31:19.847 --> 31:21.611
This is quite extraordinary, Bucky.

31:21.767 --> 31:24.008
I think you've got quite a future
in this business.

31:24.487 --> 31:26.091
- No.
- Yeah.

31:26.247 --> 31:27.692
Can I borrow him for a minute?

31:27.847 --> 31:29.531
I would just love
to show him around...

31:29.687 --> 31:31.655
...and introduce him
to some people, okay?

31:31.807 --> 31:35.209
Yeah, come on. No, I'm serious.

31:37.447 --> 31:40.257
It's Miles Deep, the director.

31:40.407 --> 31:42.296
How about I direct my dick
in your mouth...

31:42.447 --> 31:44.495
...if you don't get
the fuck out of here?

31:44.647 --> 31:47.048
Look, let me just go in there
for a minute and I can--

31:47.207 --> 31:50.256
Wait. Wait. You son of a bitch.

31:50.727 --> 31:52.491
Party people!

31:55.807 --> 31:58.538
Yeah. Let's stop the music, please.

31:58.967 --> 32:01.618
I've got somebody very important
I want you to meet.

32:02.247 --> 32:05.251
Now I've seen many porn stars
come and go...

32:05.407 --> 32:07.694
...but this guy right here I just met...

32:07.847 --> 32:10.851
...he's gonna be coming
for a very long time.

32:12.487 --> 32:15.855
Ladies and gentlemen,
may I present Bucky Larson?

32:18.167 --> 32:19.328
Hey, how are you?

32:21.087 --> 32:23.693
Drop the pants.
Show them what you got, kid.

32:23.847 --> 32:24.973
All right.

32:33.607 --> 32:36.497
Did I mention he'll be starring
in lesbian porn?

32:40.927 --> 32:42.417
No.

32:48.247 --> 32:49.578
Somebody help him.

32:49.727 --> 32:51.695
I'll save you, little man.

32:55.447 --> 32:57.415
He really pushed you
In the pool like that?

32:57.567 --> 32:58.853
What a jerk.

32:59.007 --> 33:01.214
Maybe he thought
you were a walrus.

33:04.607 --> 33:07.292
Yeah, and I can't swim good
without my water wings, you know.

33:07.767 --> 33:10.532
You know, Dick Shadow's
the biggest star in the nude business.

33:10.687 --> 33:12.735
You know, I mean,
what am I gonna do?

33:12.887 --> 33:16.175
Well, if it makes you feel any better,
I've never heard of Dick Shadow...

33:16.327 --> 33:18.409
...but I have heard of Bucky Larson.

33:21.167 --> 33:22.817
Hey, Kathy.

33:23.367 --> 33:25.290
There's a dead cat
in the woman's bathroom.

33:25.447 --> 33:26.892
I need you to put it in my car.

33:28.167 --> 33:29.612
I can feed it to my snake.

33:30.647 --> 33:32.615
- Okay.
- Stop being difficult.

33:39.287 --> 33:40.573
Excuse me.

33:40.727 --> 33:44.015
Thought I overheard you say
something about the nude business.

33:44.247 --> 33:45.248
Yeah.

33:45.767 --> 33:47.849
Were you at Dick Shadow's party
last night?

33:48.007 --> 33:49.293
Yeah, for a little bit.

33:49.447 --> 33:52.849
- Are you friends with Dick?
- No, not exactly.

33:53.007 --> 33:55.374
- My friend Claudio brought me.
- The director, right?

33:57.047 --> 33:58.936
I'm a director too.

33:59.367 --> 34:02.098
Miles. Miles Deep.

34:02.247 --> 34:05.137
Wow, cool. Pleasure to meet you.
Bucky Larson.

34:05.287 --> 34:07.688
- So did you go to Dick's party too?
- No.

34:07.847 --> 34:11.533
The porn world is full
of fucking degenerates.

34:11.687 --> 34:14.610
My folks aren't degenerates.
They're the sweetest in the world...

34:14.766 --> 34:16.735
...and they were gigantors
in the pornos.

34:16.887 --> 34:18.331
Who were your folks?

34:18.487 --> 34:20.649
Rosie Bush and Jim Spraysium.

34:23.206 --> 34:25.608
- Farmer in the Smell?
- Yeah.

34:25.766 --> 34:27.690
I worked on that movie.

34:27.847 --> 34:29.257
Yeah, get right out of a creek.

34:29.407 --> 34:32.172
I was a production assistant.

34:35.967 --> 34:39.858
- Hell, they were the last real originals.
- I'll tell them you said that.

34:40.806 --> 34:43.492
I knew I knew that accent.

34:44.487 --> 34:47.616
Everyone keeps talking about
my accent, but I'm from America.

34:50.367 --> 34:54.417
- Do you want to be on camera?
- Yeah.

34:55.047 --> 34:58.210
I just bought a vintage camera.

34:58.967 --> 35:00.810
Would you like to shoot
something tonight?

35:03.607 --> 35:06.929
Yeah. I think I can do that.

35:11.647 --> 35:13.536
Did you take Social Studies
in fifth grade?

35:13.687 --> 35:15.689
- Yeah, for sure. I got a B.
- Yeah.

35:15.847 --> 35:18.327
- The line by your thumb says B.
- No fooling.

35:21.247 --> 35:25.093
- Is that guy retarded, Miles?
- No, Jimmy, you're retarded.

35:26.087 --> 35:28.533
I told you, his parents were famous.

35:28.687 --> 35:30.735
There may be a nostalgic market
out there.

35:30.887 --> 35:32.889
Bucky, come on over here
and stand by the bar.

35:33.047 --> 35:34.333
Oh, yeah, sure.

35:38.927 --> 35:41.931
Nice, Gretchen. Really sexy.

35:42.087 --> 35:45.375
I knew I'd be good at this.
I was a huge whore in high school.

35:45.527 --> 35:49.054
Okay, and we're rolling.
Iowa, go ahead and step in there.

35:51.607 --> 35:53.609
Get that fucking thing out of there.

35:53.767 --> 35:54.893
Jesus.

35:55.887 --> 35:58.049
Don't look at the camera.

35:58.207 --> 36:01.575
All right, Bucky, go ahead,
lose the shirt. Let's see how you look.

36:07.687 --> 36:10.896
Kill that light.
I got a glare off of Bucky's chest.

36:13.127 --> 36:16.097
Okay, Bucky, let's go ahead,
drop your pants.

36:16.247 --> 36:17.897
Yeah, no problem.

36:32.887 --> 36:37.927
Okay, Gretchen, now would be
a good time to pop out the puppies.

36:54.367 --> 36:55.698
What the fuck just happened?

36:56.607 --> 36:59.292
My brain just sparkled.

37:00.287 --> 37:01.618
Where did that go?

37:01.767 --> 37:04.008
Oh, I see some on the ceiling.

37:05.287 --> 37:07.369
I don't think I have any on me.

37:22.567 --> 37:24.251
Did he just come again?

37:24.407 --> 37:26.887
Yeah. You got it on the lens.

37:27.367 --> 37:29.529
I'm so sorry, Miles.

37:29.767 --> 37:31.769
I have no control, honest.

37:33.607 --> 37:35.052
No worries, kid.

37:35.207 --> 37:38.017
Go ahead, put your clothes back on.

37:41.047 --> 37:42.412
So...

37:42.887 --> 37:44.651
...was it good or bad? How did I do?

37:46.167 --> 37:48.010
It was....

37:50.207 --> 37:51.208
It was.

37:53.007 --> 37:56.807
- Yes.
- Let's wrap it up for today.

37:56.967 --> 37:58.457
Jimmy will give you a ride home.

37:58.607 --> 38:00.496
He's not gonna jizz all over my car,
is he?

38:00.647 --> 38:02.486
Shut the fuck up, Jimmy.

38:07.847 --> 38:09.611
Here you go.

38:14.807 --> 38:15.808
Where's the blue one?

38:17.767 --> 38:19.895
Don't play with me, man.

38:20.487 --> 38:21.613
And the black one.

38:22.407 --> 38:25.854
The black one is what keeps me
from biting your fucking ear off.

38:27.447 --> 38:30.417
It's just my mom said that
you went to rehab a couple times--

38:30.567 --> 38:31.648
Your mom's a slut.

38:32.327 --> 38:33.613
But she's your sister.

38:33.767 --> 38:35.690
Exactly. How do you think I know?

38:36.127 --> 38:39.256
Why are you looking at this footage?
I thought you said it was garbage.

38:39.407 --> 38:42.616
Because I'm looking to see
how the camera looks.

38:42.767 --> 38:45.213
- If that's all right with you, shit stains.
- It's fine.

38:45.367 --> 38:47.131
Thank you.

38:48.647 --> 38:50.695
My God.

38:51.127 --> 38:53.892
This guy has got some piano keys
in his mouth.

38:54.487 --> 38:57.377
Yeah, when he pulled down his pants,
I thought he had a vagina.

38:57.527 --> 39:01.213
Yeah. I had that vagina moment too.

39:02.687 --> 39:06.897
Even though he's hung like a ladybug,
at least he's not afraid to show it.

39:08.847 --> 39:10.212
God, I got up too fast.

39:11.327 --> 39:13.375
What do you want me to do
with all the footage?

39:13.527 --> 39:17.293
I don't give a fuck what you do with it.
Put it up your ass.

39:23.407 --> 39:26.172
Gary, I'm so glad
you're finally awake.

39:26.327 --> 39:29.012
I had the craziest night last night.
I shot an actual movie--

39:29.167 --> 39:30.896
Whose cereal is that?

39:31.367 --> 39:32.653
Mine. I bought it yesterday.

39:32.807 --> 39:34.093
Did you buy your own milk?

39:34.567 --> 39:36.649
- No. Can I borrow some?
- Hell, no. Fuck you.

39:41.607 --> 39:43.689
Hey. Hi, Bucky.

39:43.847 --> 39:45.087
Hey, Kathy.

39:45.247 --> 39:47.136
What's up, Kathy?
Would you like some milk?

39:47.767 --> 39:50.532
No, thanks, Gary. Hey, Bucky.
You wanna walk me to work?

39:50.687 --> 39:52.576
Yeah, sure.

39:53.047 --> 39:55.653
- I like walking.
- That's nice, Gary.

39:56.527 --> 39:58.097
- Come on.
- I had the craziest night.

39:58.247 --> 39:59.931
Oh, yeah? What happened?

40:00.607 --> 40:03.577
Why don't you walk on my tits,
you big, fucking lesbo?

40:03.847 --> 40:06.532
Hi, Mom. No, I wasn't talking to you.

40:07.167 --> 40:10.649
It was like I dreamed. The lights were
on and the director had a cool camera.

40:10.807 --> 40:13.208
When I pulled down my pants,
I saw colours in my brain.

40:13.367 --> 40:15.369
Then there was a pop.
And then stuff came out.

40:15.527 --> 40:17.256
There was a pop,
they said, "It was."

40:17.407 --> 40:20.297
They had a weird helmet. They
knew I got a B in Social Studies.

40:21.527 --> 40:23.131
I mean, you've been here two days...

40:23.287 --> 40:25.176
...and your dreams
are already coming true.

40:25.327 --> 40:27.136
- That's incredible.
- Yeah, it's crazy.

40:27.287 --> 40:28.891
I don't know, but I'm babbling.

40:29.047 --> 40:31.095
Enough about me.
I wanna know about you, Kathy.

40:31.247 --> 40:32.737
What are your dreams?

40:33.607 --> 40:36.008
I want to be a waitress.

40:36.847 --> 40:38.895
Your dreams came true.
Why didn't you tell me?

40:39.047 --> 40:41.368
So you know what I'm going through.
Dreams are crazy.

40:41.527 --> 40:45.134
Well, not really.
I mean, the diner's not my dream.

40:45.287 --> 40:47.016
It's my nightmare, actually.

40:47.167 --> 40:50.808
But, you know,
it's where I've been banished.

40:51.167 --> 40:53.010
Yeah, I was going to
mention that earlier.

40:53.167 --> 40:54.771
The people don't seem nice to you...

40:54.927 --> 40:58.090
...and the food
makes my bottom burn.

40:58.767 --> 41:00.178
Why were you banished?

41:00.327 --> 41:02.409
There was an incident, Bucky.

41:03.127 --> 41:07.371
- You killed a man?
- No. Not exactly.

41:07.847 --> 41:11.818
When I first moved to L. A.,
I got a job at a five-star restaurant.

41:12.447 --> 41:14.097
You know, it was my dream job.

41:14.247 --> 41:15.976
And on the first day of training...

41:16.127 --> 41:20.496
...I was carrying a tray of soups
for a table of 10.

41:21.167 --> 41:24.011
And it was heavy, you know?
But I toughed it out.

41:24.167 --> 41:26.818
But then, halfway to the table,
my arm gave out...

41:26.967 --> 41:29.777
...and I spilled soup
all over this old lady.

41:31.687 --> 41:33.769
She screamed...

41:34.007 --> 41:35.850
...so loud.

41:36.847 --> 41:40.010
She had to be choppered
to a burn unit in San Diego.

41:40.167 --> 41:41.168
No.

41:41.327 --> 41:42.533
And ever since then...

41:42.687 --> 41:48.410
...you know, I just burst into tears
when I see a large food tray.

41:49.847 --> 41:52.691
So that's why I work at Tony's.

41:53.247 --> 41:55.056
No trays.

41:55.207 --> 41:57.653
Listen up, Kath.
We'll get your dream back, okay?

41:57.807 --> 42:00.458
And you won't burn the elderly.
I promise.

42:01.567 --> 42:02.648
Thanks, Bucky.

42:04.887 --> 42:07.128
- Oh, there's one other thing.
- What?

42:07.287 --> 42:08.777
You're it.

42:17.087 --> 42:19.488
- Hi, Bucky.
- Hey, Miles.

42:19.647 --> 42:20.773
It's great to see you.

42:20.927 --> 42:22.736
So hey, how did our scene
edit together?

42:23.807 --> 42:25.889
That's what I want
to talk to you about.

42:26.047 --> 42:27.811
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah. Now, listen.

42:27.967 --> 42:29.332
Yeah. Sit.

42:33.927 --> 42:37.932
So I think you should be
in the porn business.

42:39.767 --> 42:44.614
But in another way
besides on camera.

42:45.687 --> 42:48.657
Perhaps behind the scenes.

42:50.407 --> 42:54.378
But I want to be a star.
It's my destiny.

42:54.527 --> 42:56.848
Yeah, yeah, I know, Bucky.

42:57.047 --> 42:59.448
Your parents and destiny.

43:00.607 --> 43:04.976
But porn stars have to have
certain things.

43:05.527 --> 43:09.134
- You know?
- Yeah, I can get a tan.

43:09.807 --> 43:13.368
No, I meant more in the crotch area.

43:13.527 --> 43:15.768
Oh, yeah. No, I can tan my crotch.

43:17.247 --> 43:18.373
No, Bucky.

43:18.527 --> 43:20.291
He's talking about your dick,
dum-dum.

43:20.447 --> 43:22.097
You don't got the:

43:26.087 --> 43:30.536
Bucky, you're a really nice kid.

43:31.407 --> 43:33.853
I just don't want to see you
waste your time.

43:36.167 --> 43:38.090
I'm just trying to be
honest with you, kid.

43:42.047 --> 43:43.048
Yeah, okay.

43:46.887 --> 43:48.651
I'm sorry. I gotta go.

43:50.447 --> 43:52.017
Bucky, are you all right?

43:52.167 --> 43:54.295
Yeah, I'm okay.

43:54.647 --> 43:56.251
Bucky.

44:01.727 --> 44:05.334
Hey, Miles, baby.
I'll do a movie for you.

44:06.167 --> 44:08.010
I'm hung like a cocker spaniel.

44:09.607 --> 44:14.010
- Cocker spaniel is not a big dog.
- Yeah, but it's nice and soft.

44:14.167 --> 44:15.532
With cuddly eyes.

44:16.407 --> 44:17.852
Your dick has cuddly eyes?

44:18.647 --> 44:22.413
You know what I mean.
You know what the fuck I mean.

44:24.567 --> 44:26.171
Fuck you!

44:34.527 --> 44:36.416
Did you eat one of my grapes?

44:36.567 --> 44:40.014
Is that why you're crying,
you son of a bitch?

44:40.167 --> 44:41.931
You're pathetic.

44:51.007 --> 44:54.807
What the fuck is with
the forwarding of all the videos?

44:56.007 --> 44:58.135
What did my mom send me?

45:00.647 --> 45:02.092
What the fuck?

45:02.247 --> 45:04.136
I uploaded it on youpube.net.

45:04.287 --> 45:06.972
It's gotten almost a million hits
in three days.

45:08.287 --> 45:09.288
- You're kidding.
- No.

45:09.447 --> 45:12.894
All my friends watched it with their
girls and they all got laid afterwards.

45:13.447 --> 45:14.937
Right.

45:15.967 --> 45:17.731
The guys aren't threatened.

45:17.887 --> 45:21.414
And the girls think they've got a prize
compared to Bucky.

45:25.287 --> 45:27.654
Every small dick out there
has been waiting for this.

45:28.447 --> 45:29.448
How do you know that?

45:30.367 --> 45:32.256
Let's stay focused.

45:32.967 --> 45:34.366
This is a good angle.

45:34.367 --> 45:34.777
Retail Spell Checked

45:37.407 --> 45:40.650
I'm just saying, I've never been
fully filled up on camera before.

45:40.807 --> 45:43.936
You're saying you have more inches
to your torpedo?

45:44.087 --> 45:45.088
At least five more.

45:45.567 --> 45:48.776
- We could blow some minds.
- And more loads.

45:51.127 --> 45:54.097
- J. Day.
- Hey, Miles, come in.

45:54.247 --> 45:56.375
- How's it going, buddy?
- Good, good.

45:56.527 --> 45:58.097
Do you know Dick Shadow?

45:58.247 --> 46:00.249
- Yeah. It's been a while.
- Yeah.

46:00.407 --> 46:02.535
Yeah, well, you've been busy.

46:03.807 --> 46:05.775
Yeah, Nice. Miles, is that the DVD?

46:06.607 --> 46:08.177
Right there.

46:08.327 --> 46:11.456
Miles called me about discovering
the new heat in porn.

46:11.607 --> 46:14.895
Really?
I didn't know porn needed heating up.

46:16.327 --> 46:18.136
Do you mind if I sit in on this,
J. Day?

46:18.287 --> 46:20.176
- Yeah, yeah, yes, of course.
- Yeah.

46:20.327 --> 46:22.250
Stay and check it out.
Have a seat, Miles.

46:22.407 --> 46:24.569
- Make yourself comfy.
- Okay. Thanks.

46:33.607 --> 46:35.769
I know who that guy is.

46:44.407 --> 46:47.968
- Does he have pussy?
- Wait, wait, wait.

46:52.807 --> 46:55.048
Wait a minute here.

46:55.207 --> 46:57.448
What--?
What's he turning into, a werewolf?

46:57.607 --> 47:00.577
He's got quite the squirt gun, huh?

47:06.727 --> 47:08.411
Well, what do you think?

47:08.567 --> 47:10.535
I mean, the guy can spunk
like a monkey...

47:10.687 --> 47:13.213
...but his face is a nightmare
with the teeth.

47:13.647 --> 47:16.617
He should not be on camera.
You're pulling my nuts, huh?

47:16.767 --> 47:18.974
- This a joke?
- No.

47:19.127 --> 47:21.937
This thing was all over the Internet.

47:22.087 --> 47:26.092
It was the most e-mailed clip
of the week on youpube.net.

47:26.247 --> 47:30.377
Yes, of course it was. This guy's like
Muppet with clown-flower spray-penis.

47:30.967 --> 47:32.651
But this isn't porno, man.

47:32.807 --> 47:35.697
Porn is to fantasies about the cock
you wish you had.

47:35.847 --> 47:38.248
Or wish was in your wife's hand
or ass crack.

47:39.127 --> 47:43.451
But it's also about the cock
you're glad you don't have.

47:45.047 --> 47:48.290
I know it's different,
but this could be something...

47:48.447 --> 47:49.687
...really groundbreaking.

47:50.607 --> 47:54.214
J. Day, you got to give this a shot.

47:54.647 --> 47:57.378
You know what?
I want to do several shots of tequila...

47:57.527 --> 48:01.851
...black out, and forget I ever saw
the rat face and mouse pee-pee.

48:03.527 --> 48:07.168
Listen, I'm really sorry, Miles.
What can I do?

48:07.687 --> 48:09.849
- I'm sorry, buddy.
- Okay.

48:11.327 --> 48:14.809
Take it easy, broheim. Relax.
Go home, wax your asshole.

48:17.287 --> 48:19.449
I feel bad turning my back on him.

48:19.607 --> 48:22.929
But he's a mess with the pills and the
ex-wives and the:

48:26.727 --> 48:29.856
- Are you into pills too?
- No, it's just a little Viagra.

48:30.167 --> 48:31.976
I'm going to the mall.

48:34.527 --> 48:35.858
Jeez.

48:37.287 --> 48:39.051
Are you sure you wanna do this,
Miles?

48:39.207 --> 48:41.778
My professor said you should
never invest your own money.

48:41.927 --> 48:45.374
Yeah? And where is your professor?

48:45.527 --> 48:49.293
In the classroom,
teaching a bunch of dick-divers.

48:49.447 --> 48:52.337
I'm a fucking artist
and the movies always come first.

48:52.487 --> 48:55.616
Not money, not happiness,
the movies.

48:56.207 --> 48:58.733
You know who knows that?
My first wife, my second wife...

48:58.887 --> 49:01.015
...my fourth wife, and my ninth wife.

49:01.727 --> 49:03.616
Plus, I just got approved for a loan.

49:04.927 --> 49:06.417
What bank gave you a loan?

49:06.567 --> 49:09.696
The bank of the Vietnamese mafia.

49:14.127 --> 49:15.856
I just got off a night shoot.

49:16.007 --> 49:19.534
I wrapped another movie like
an hour ago and I come right over.

49:19.687 --> 49:22.896
You know, you should get some sleep,
though. Sleep ls really important.

49:23.047 --> 49:25.288
My mom said everyone
should have nine hours a day.

49:25.447 --> 49:28.337
Nine hours would be good.
I love work, you know....

49:28.487 --> 49:30.091
What the fuck are you doing?

49:30.247 --> 49:33.296
- I was just trying to fix his hair.
- But who told you to do that?

49:33.447 --> 49:35.814
- I thought--
- I don't give a shit what you thought.

49:35.967 --> 49:38.891
I don't want him to look good.
I want him to look natural.

49:39.687 --> 49:41.610
But he looks horrible.

49:42.407 --> 49:43.932
Get the fuck out.

49:45.007 --> 49:46.896
Get the fuck out.

49:49.007 --> 49:51.135
- How are you feeling, Bucky?
- I'm good.

49:51.287 --> 49:53.574
I think he was trying to be nice.
He was tired--

49:53.727 --> 49:55.695
Who cares? Fuck him.
He's getting paid.

49:55.847 --> 49:58.418
I want to talk to you
about the scene we're about to shoot.

49:58.567 --> 50:00.729
- Oh, yeah. Okay, good.
- Okay.

50:00.887 --> 50:04.733
You're a paperboy. And you've been
delivering papers all day long.

50:04.887 --> 50:06.889
And you're hot. And you're tired.

50:07.047 --> 50:09.573
You've been up and down the streets,
throwing the papers.

50:09.727 --> 50:12.810
And you need an ice cream.

50:13.487 --> 50:14.693
Oh, boy.

50:15.487 --> 50:16.568
What?

50:17.407 --> 50:19.057
I never delivered a paper in my life.

50:19.207 --> 50:22.017
I'm so sorry. I should have told you.
I just didn't even think.

50:22.167 --> 50:24.295
I didn't have a paper route
in the neighbourhood.

50:24.447 --> 50:26.768
I mowed the lawns.
You want to make it lawn mowing--

50:26.927 --> 50:29.658
It's okay. It's okay. It's okay.

50:30.487 --> 50:34.697
Oh, God. I love it
that you care about the details.

50:34.847 --> 50:37.293
- Yeah.
- Did we powder Blueberry's tits?

50:38.247 --> 50:40.818
- Not yet.
- Well, why the fuck not?

50:40.967 --> 50:42.412
Yo, fruit bat.

50:43.807 --> 50:45.411
- Where the fuck are you going?
- What?

50:45.567 --> 50:48.173
- I thought you said--
- Fuck you, what I thought.

50:48.327 --> 50:51.171
Powder her tits.
Do something right today.

50:54.567 --> 50:56.569
Excuse me, ma'am.
Could you wait one second?

50:56.727 --> 50:59.014
- For what?
- We're shooting a movie.

51:00.447 --> 51:03.053
Who's the star, Judge Reinhold?

51:08.047 --> 51:10.414
Is it a monster movie?

51:10.567 --> 51:15.368
- And er-action.
- Oh, er-action. Bucky, go. Go, go, go.

51:19.247 --> 51:20.772
Hey, ma'am, I got your paper.

51:20.927 --> 51:23.692
You can leave the paper
on the counter.

51:27.007 --> 51:28.850
- I got it right.
- I saw it.

51:29.007 --> 51:30.008
Don't look at me.

51:33.647 --> 51:36.457
I have a problem, paperboy.

51:38.367 --> 51:40.654
Maybe you can help me.

51:40.807 --> 51:42.093
I have a sundae...

51:43.287 --> 51:47.372
...but it needs nuts and cream on it.

51:47.847 --> 51:50.851
Oh, no. Here, let me help.
I'll just get my scooper out.

51:56.727 --> 51:59.378
- That's it?
- It's average.

51:59.847 --> 52:04.774
Boy, my sugar cones
could really use some alr.

52:24.247 --> 52:27.456
Cut! That was great, Bucky.

52:27.607 --> 52:30.895
- It was?
- It was.

52:31.047 --> 52:32.856
Do you got another one in you?
Good.

52:33.007 --> 52:35.055
That was great. Good job.

52:35.367 --> 52:37.017
Hi, Blueberry, do you need a rag?

52:37.167 --> 52:40.808
I saw it come out,
but I didn't get any on me.

52:40.967 --> 52:42.890
There's some on my shoe.

52:43.047 --> 52:45.448
I wouldn't eat that.

52:45.607 --> 52:46.733
Okay, you can walk now.

52:46.887 --> 52:48.810
Thanks,
but I'm gonna send you a bill...

52:48.967 --> 52:51.857
...for this bird poop on my shoulder.

53:03.927 --> 53:07.374
So there it is. The future.

53:08.487 --> 53:10.091
I wanted you all to see it first...

53:10.247 --> 53:12.932
...because you're the best distributors
in the business.

53:13.087 --> 53:15.135
And I value your opinion.

53:15.287 --> 53:16.971
And we're looking
for a modest deal...

53:17.127 --> 53:20.609
...foreign and domestic.
Any questions?

53:21.567 --> 53:25.128
- Yeah, Eddie.
- Miles, are you fucking kidding us?

53:25.287 --> 53:27.972
- What?
- That didn't even get me half hard.

53:28.127 --> 53:30.778
It actually got my dick
to go back inside me...

53:30.927 --> 53:33.817
...and it's pointed towards
my stomach.

53:34.087 --> 53:35.657
And it hurts.

53:35.807 --> 53:37.172
It's a new style.

53:37.327 --> 53:40.888
But Eddie, this is going to catch on.

53:41.047 --> 53:42.970
How did he lose his penis?

53:43.127 --> 53:44.617
Was it a hunting accident?

53:46.567 --> 53:50.697
Miles, where'd you find a
buck-tooth dyke with a clit that big?

53:56.967 --> 53:58.093
Unbelievable.

53:59.527 --> 54:00.653
So that went good?

54:08.727 --> 54:10.729
Who's taller?

54:10.887 --> 54:12.173
He is.

54:12.327 --> 54:13.897
Okay. All right, well, wait.

54:15.607 --> 54:17.928
- Now, who's taller?
- He is.

54:19.127 --> 54:21.812
Look, Bucky, I'm a parade float.

54:22.247 --> 54:24.056
Oh, my gosh.

54:27.487 --> 54:30.491
I don't know what those distribution
guys were talking about, Bucky.

54:30.647 --> 54:34.015
I thought you were totally adorable
and charming in that paperboy movie.

54:34.167 --> 54:36.329
Really? Thanks.

54:36.487 --> 54:38.410
Yeah, I just got to keep on believing.

54:38.567 --> 54:41.218
You know,
this town ls really testing me.

54:41.367 --> 54:44.576
Yeah. And you know what's funny?

54:44.727 --> 54:46.411
Clowns?

54:46.687 --> 54:48.894
Yes, but, you know, in your videos...

54:49.047 --> 54:52.017
...you never actually have
sex with the girls.

54:53.607 --> 54:57.578
Yeah, I've never really
done that before, so I don't know.

54:57.727 --> 55:00.492
Yeah. No.

55:02.807 --> 55:05.128
- Can I take a picture?
- All right. How's my hair?

55:05.287 --> 55:07.686
Very good. Very good.

55:08.287 --> 55:10.255
No way. I don't believe this.

55:10.407 --> 55:13.217
I've seen all the shit In here,
but that is not real.

55:13.367 --> 55:15.051
- Hi.
- Whoa, shit.

55:15.207 --> 55:17.892
I'm sorry, man. You're real. Okay.

55:18.047 --> 55:19.856
They pay you
to glue those chopsticks on?

55:20.007 --> 55:22.658
- To glue what sticks?
- Baby, I don't think he works here.

55:22.807 --> 55:24.457
I don't care. If those are real...

55:24.607 --> 55:27.736
...then I gotta get a picture
with the beaver man. Here, watch this.

55:28.527 --> 55:32.498
All right, leave it to my man, beaver.
Look at you, brother.

55:32.647 --> 55:35.218
You could tear up a carrot.
Look at that.

55:35.367 --> 55:36.448
Thanks.

55:42.967 --> 55:45.493
Are my teeth really that weird?

55:45.647 --> 55:48.173
No. Not at all.

55:48.327 --> 55:50.489
They just have character.

55:50.687 --> 55:52.018
- Really?
- Yeah.

55:52.167 --> 55:53.578
Thanks, Kathy.

55:53.727 --> 55:56.333
No. It cannot be.

55:59.287 --> 56:00.777
Yeah, they're real.

56:00.927 --> 56:03.294
You are him?
Bucky from the Internet?

56:03.447 --> 56:05.131
You spray from your nest.

56:05.287 --> 56:07.210
Yeah, that's me.

56:07.367 --> 56:12.294
Your video was beautiful, inspiring.

56:15.167 --> 56:17.010
It was such a big help to me
and my wife.

56:17.167 --> 56:21.092
She had grown tired
of my Water Wiggle...

56:21.247 --> 56:25.297
...but you renewed her joy in my rod.

56:25.447 --> 56:29.133
- Thank you so much.
- Yeah, my pleasure. That's great.

56:29.287 --> 56:32.177
Listen, I have a restaurant
called Chop.

56:32.327 --> 56:34.056
It is an Italian steakhouse.

56:34.207 --> 56:36.653
You come in,
I'll give you the meal of your lifetime.

56:37.487 --> 56:39.251
- What?
- I know Chop.

56:39.407 --> 56:42.490
You got nine-and-a-half stars
out of 10 in Restaurant Magazine.

56:42.647 --> 56:46.094
The only Los Angeles restaurant
to do that in four years.

56:46.247 --> 56:49.729
Their chef, Alfred DuPont,
flies in stone crab claws...

56:49.887 --> 56:52.208
...fresh from Florida every day.

56:52.367 --> 56:55.052
And he's also cultivated
the largest wine selection...

56:55.207 --> 56:57.608
...in all of southern California.
And he's a Libra.

56:57.767 --> 56:59.496
Wow, how do you know this?

57:00.967 --> 57:02.651
I'm a food fan.

57:02.807 --> 57:04.809
Kathy's like the best waitress
in the world.

57:04.967 --> 57:05.968
Where do you work?

57:07.927 --> 57:10.089
She's talking to a couple places.

57:11.087 --> 57:14.250
You come in to Chop on Friday,
you ask for Dominic.

57:14.407 --> 57:17.172
I'll see if we got any openings.

57:17.327 --> 57:19.648
- Thank you so much.
- Thank you.

57:24.607 --> 57:25.608
Oh, my God.

57:26.247 --> 57:27.817
Bucky.

57:28.327 --> 57:30.898
Wow, your head is full
of so many food facts.

57:32.327 --> 57:34.898
But Bucky, I can't.

57:36.727 --> 57:40.493
The old woman. I burned somebody.

57:40.647 --> 57:44.174
Listen to me. That was an accident.

57:44.327 --> 57:45.533
You can do this.

57:46.087 --> 57:48.613
Come on, you can't keep working
in that stupid diner...

57:48.767 --> 57:52.010
...getting tipped in Monopoly money
and belly-button lint.

57:54.887 --> 57:58.608
I know it's hard, but I'll help you.

57:58.767 --> 58:00.815
We can do this.

58:00.967 --> 58:02.173
Okay.

58:06.207 --> 58:09.416
- Video or the teeth?
- Teeth.

58:12.327 --> 58:16.616
Oh, no, no. We gotta have six or eight
of those before you get the fire started.

58:16.767 --> 58:18.371
What's the big whoop-de-doo,
Miles?

58:18.527 --> 58:20.131
Bucky.

58:20.287 --> 58:24.258
Hey. Hey, what's the deal
with your roommate?

58:24.407 --> 58:26.808
You can't talk on the phone
for more than 20 seconds...

58:26.967 --> 58:28.617
...or else he'll burn your pubes off?

58:28.767 --> 58:32.328
Oh, Yeah, I know. Gary just had
a rough day. He's got diarrhoea.

58:32.487 --> 58:34.728
You keep pubes.

58:35.367 --> 58:37.495
Anyway. Great news.

58:37.647 --> 58:40.730
We set up a link so that people
could buy our latest piece of work...

58:40.887 --> 58:42.730
- ...and guess what.
- What?

58:42.887 --> 58:44.616
It's selling like a mofo.

58:44.767 --> 58:46.212
Hot dog.

58:46.367 --> 58:48.973
Not only did we make
all of our money back...

58:49.127 --> 58:52.654
...the Vietnamese guys have offered to
finance a couple more pictures for us.

58:53.127 --> 58:55.858
- No fooling?
- Fuck fooling.

58:56.007 --> 58:59.056
You were right.
You were born to be a star.

58:59.207 --> 59:02.654
This is-- I gotta call my folks.

59:02.807 --> 59:05.856
I have to tell Kathy. I'm gonna
call Kathy? My gosh. And my folks--

59:06.007 --> 59:08.214
You do that and we're going to party.

59:08.807 --> 59:11.856
- Oh, shit.
- I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Sorry.

01:00:10.007 --> 01:00:14.092
Where the fuck do I put my
grapes now, you insensitive bastard?

01:00:33.287 --> 01:00:35.972
I'm an old lady and I love soup.

01:00:48.847 --> 01:00:52.294
- I did it.
- You did it! I knew you could!

01:00:52.447 --> 01:00:54.017
Bucky!

01:01:08.967 --> 01:01:11.288
There you go.
Enjoy the brain sparkle.

01:01:11.447 --> 01:01:15.497
- Next.
- We are just so excited to meet you.

01:01:15.647 --> 01:01:18.617
I mean, for so long,
our relationship was really off.

01:01:18.767 --> 01:01:20.007
It was just shit.

01:01:20.647 --> 01:01:22.536
My boyfriend's
got a really small dick.

01:01:22.687 --> 01:01:25.133
Like, no meat on it.
And it really bothered me.

01:01:25.727 --> 01:01:27.650
I was kind of used
to being with guys...

01:01:27.807 --> 01:01:30.094
...with big-to-huge dicks
before I met him.

01:01:30.247 --> 01:01:32.375
I thought dicks
were supposed to be like that...

01:01:32.527 --> 01:01:34.416
...with fatness and length
and whatever.

01:01:34.567 --> 01:01:36.649
When Allen would ask me to blow him,
I was like:

01:01:36.807 --> 01:01:40.016
"Keep that fucking gross niblet
away from me."

01:01:40.167 --> 01:01:42.408
But then when I saw your dick...

01:01:42.567 --> 01:01:45.935
...it was like a rebirth,
a new beginning.

01:01:46.807 --> 01:01:49.048
I watched the whole video
and I thought...

01:01:49.207 --> 01:01:52.290
...maybe I do have something great
with Allen after all.

01:01:52.447 --> 01:01:55.098
Compared to you, he's gigantic.

01:01:55.247 --> 01:01:57.898
I mean, you make me look
like I got a big dick.

01:01:59.007 --> 01:02:01.613
So anyways,
we've been fucking a lot.

01:02:01.767 --> 01:02:04.657
And I can't ride his dick
because I always fall right off.

01:02:04.807 --> 01:02:08.016
But he's been dogging me
and I don't know, I can kind of feel It...

01:02:08.167 --> 01:02:11.694
...or it's his pubes bumping up
against my sandbar, but whatever.

01:02:11.847 --> 01:02:15.329
At least we're doing it, connecting.

01:02:15.487 --> 01:02:17.091
Just, thank you.

01:02:17.447 --> 01:02:19.609
Yeah. Thank you.

01:02:19.767 --> 01:02:21.735
Changing lives.

01:02:22.687 --> 01:02:25.133
Our next guest went from
being an Internet sensation...

01:02:25.287 --> 01:02:28.814
...to getting the most nominations
in the history of adult film.

01:02:28.967 --> 01:02:31.254
This should be good.

01:02:32.487 --> 01:02:35.058
Please welcome Bucky Larson,
everybody.

01:02:39.527 --> 01:02:42.178
No! You fucking prick!

01:02:45.247 --> 01:02:49.093
You don't look like
the average porn star.

01:02:49.247 --> 01:02:52.012
Oh, yeah,
because I'm wearing a sweater.

01:03:12.327 --> 01:03:13.408
Blueberry's with me.

01:03:17.967 --> 01:03:19.207
Bucky.

01:03:22.007 --> 01:03:23.372
Another shot, Bucky.

01:03:26.247 --> 01:03:27.294
Bucky....

01:03:29.687 --> 01:03:30.688
It's Bucky.

01:03:32.007 --> 01:03:33.691
- Is that him?
- Hey, Bucky.

01:03:33.847 --> 01:03:35.417
God, he's here.

01:03:35.567 --> 01:03:38.491
Miles.
It's great to see you, Miles. Hello.

01:03:38.647 --> 01:03:43.369
Your vision with Bucky?
I didn't see it, but you did.

01:03:43.527 --> 01:03:46.849
You turned a Tic Tac
into a gold mine.

01:03:47.847 --> 01:03:49.736
- Well, here he is.
- Hey, how are you?

01:03:49.887 --> 01:03:51.332
Hello, it's great to meet you.

01:03:51.487 --> 01:03:52.613
- Hello, beautiful.
- Hello.

01:03:52.767 --> 01:03:55.213
Yes, you can have a seat here.
Be my guest.

01:03:55.367 --> 01:03:57.608
And you know Rosie Bush
and Jim Spraysium.

01:03:57.767 --> 01:03:59.007
- Of course.
- Bucky's parents.

01:03:59.167 --> 01:04:00.293
Hi, how are you?

01:04:00.447 --> 01:04:03.610
Your movies were like
my Batman growing Up.

01:04:04.007 --> 01:04:06.897
- How sweet.
- Batman? That's swell. I love Batman.

01:04:07.047 --> 01:04:08.333
- Have a seat.
- Thanks so much.

01:04:08.487 --> 01:04:11.138
- Hey, Dick. Good to see you again.
- Good to see you too.

01:04:11.287 --> 01:04:13.289
Congratulations on winning
Best "Newcomer."

01:04:13.447 --> 01:04:16.337
What? Are we late?
Did we miss an award?

01:04:16.487 --> 01:04:19.297
- No, no, but you'll get that one.
- How do you know?

01:04:20.287 --> 01:04:22.255
That's the only award I can't win.

01:04:23.567 --> 01:04:26.252
- Who's the pretty girl?
- Oh, this is Kathy.

01:04:26.407 --> 01:04:28.774
She's my girl.... Neighbour.

01:04:29.807 --> 01:04:35.849
Friend. She lives by me.
I like her a lot. She's a girl. Lady.

01:04:36.487 --> 01:04:38.330
I'm Bucky's girlfriend.

01:04:41.087 --> 01:04:44.648
Welcome to the 15th annual
Adult Film Awards.

01:04:44.807 --> 01:04:48.175
And here's your host,
Pauly Shore.

01:04:49.127 --> 01:04:51.209
What? I love Pauly.

01:04:53.087 --> 01:04:55.533
The first award is
Best "Newcomer."

01:04:55.967 --> 01:04:58.095
Which is great
because it's something you get...

01:04:58.247 --> 01:05:00.090
...before the herpes
and hep-C kick in.

01:05:00.487 --> 01:05:03.058
- I got herpes!
- I got hep-C!

01:05:03.207 --> 01:05:06.256
And your nominees
are Steven Storm.

01:05:08.127 --> 01:05:10.653
- Mike Thunder.
- Yeah, Mike!

01:05:10.807 --> 01:05:13.572
Jeffrey Lightning.

01:05:15.527 --> 01:05:18.815
And a new kid who's making
quite a splash around here lately.

01:05:18.967 --> 01:05:19.968
Bucky Larson.

01:05:24.367 --> 01:05:25.414
And the winner is....

01:05:26.567 --> 01:05:28.331
Holy shit, Bucky Larson.

01:05:52.487 --> 01:05:54.808
I've never held a trophy before.

01:05:54.967 --> 01:05:56.492
Or given a speech.

01:05:56.887 --> 01:06:00.778
I want to thank my director,
Miles Deep, for making my movies.

01:06:00.927 --> 01:06:02.895
And for saying
I could be a paperboy...

01:06:03.047 --> 01:06:05.618
...when I swear I've never delivered
a paper in my life.

01:06:07.687 --> 01:06:09.451
Also...

01:06:10.407 --> 01:06:12.978
...to my girlfriend, Kathy.

01:06:16.967 --> 01:06:18.890
Who made sure
I didn't sleep in the bushes.

01:06:19.567 --> 01:06:22.173
And to my folks.

01:06:22.887 --> 01:06:26.255
You are my inspiration
and my heroes.

01:06:27.287 --> 01:06:31.133
I thought I was going to bag groceries
till I was grey in the hair.

01:06:33.127 --> 01:06:37.177
But you showed me
that you can have dreams.

01:06:37.327 --> 01:06:43.858
And that dreams can make
your downstairs explode with magic.

01:06:46.887 --> 01:06:51.290
Thank you. I love you so much.

01:07:00.167 --> 01:07:04.491
Okay. That's out of the way.
Now is when I cast my shadow.

01:07:04.847 --> 01:07:08.897
And the award for
biggest load goes to....

01:07:10.247 --> 01:07:11.328
Bucky Larson!

01:07:22.487 --> 01:07:24.489
Everyone In Iowa, I love you!

01:07:25.927 --> 01:07:28.168
The award for Best Bush goes to....

01:07:28.767 --> 01:07:29.768
Come on.

01:07:30.407 --> 01:07:31.488
Bucky Larson.

01:07:33.367 --> 01:07:36.177
I told you not to shave completely
down there.

01:07:36.327 --> 01:07:38.375
You have too many moles.

01:07:39.127 --> 01:07:41.016
To my roommate, Gary,
who always said:

01:07:41.167 --> 01:07:42.737
"Don't shit where you shower."

01:07:44.127 --> 01:07:46.573
Am I in the fucking Twilight Zone?

01:07:46.727 --> 01:07:49.537
- Bucky Larson!
- Bucky Larson.

01:07:49.687 --> 01:07:54.090
- Bucky Larson.
- Bucky Larson.

01:07:55.527 --> 01:07:57.894
- Bucky Larson.
- Bucky Larson.

01:07:58.047 --> 01:08:03.258
- Bucky Larson!
- Best taint is...

01:08:03.687 --> 01:08:05.291
...Bucky Larson.

01:08:05.447 --> 01:08:08.451
This is wild stuff, man. Exciting.

01:08:09.287 --> 01:08:11.528
I don't even know what a taint is.

01:08:12.607 --> 01:08:15.816
But if I have the best one,
that's because of my mother.

01:08:17.407 --> 01:08:19.694
Bucky. Buck.

01:08:20.006 --> 01:08:22.738
You're not nominated for best tits.
Come with me.

01:08:22.886 --> 01:08:25.935
- I want you to meet some people.
- Okay. Are you gonna be all right?

01:08:26.087 --> 01:08:28.977
- Yeah. Yeah, go do your thing.
- Are you sure? I'll be right back.

01:08:31.807 --> 01:08:34.697
- Quite a night.
- Yeah.

01:08:35.687 --> 01:08:37.256
This is crazy.

01:08:37.407 --> 01:08:39.455
So tell me...

01:08:39.607 --> 01:08:42.258
...a guy like Bucky,
what are his tricks?

01:08:43.727 --> 01:08:46.332
- What do you mean?
- You know, in the bedroom.

01:08:46.607 --> 01:08:48.371
He's gotta have something
up his sleeve.

01:08:48.527 --> 01:08:50.894
He surely doesn't have anything
in his pants.

01:08:51.567 --> 01:08:53.456
Well, that's Bucky's
personal business...

01:08:53.607 --> 01:08:56.258
...and I don't really think
it's any concern of yours.

01:08:58.487 --> 01:09:01.296
So you don't even know?
You two haven't...?

01:09:03.207 --> 01:09:06.734
In that case, I really think you need
to spend a night in the shadow.

01:09:07.846 --> 01:09:09.656
I'm already in the shadow.

01:09:09.807 --> 01:09:12.457
The shadow of the 11 awards
Bucky's won tonight.

01:09:13.167 --> 01:09:15.533
He's already tied your record, right?

01:09:15.687 --> 01:09:18.497
And I believe we have
one more award to go.

01:09:18.647 --> 01:09:21.457
So thanks.

01:09:24.647 --> 01:09:28.412
I don't care what they said. I have
the best taint and everybody knows it.

01:09:30.247 --> 01:09:34.809
And now for the winner of the
most prestigious award of the night.

01:09:34.966 --> 01:09:37.447
Male Genitals of the Year.

01:09:40.807 --> 01:09:42.218
And the winner...

01:09:42.367 --> 01:09:46.577
...and the new record-holder
of 12 Adult Film awards....

01:09:48.247 --> 01:09:49.612
Bucky Larson!

01:10:33.447 --> 01:10:35.370
So I asked Miles
if he wanted to hang out...

01:10:35.527 --> 01:10:38.895
...but he said he got an eight ball.
So I guess he's gonna go play pool.

01:10:44.647 --> 01:10:49.096
So it's pretty cool that we both
won awards on the same night.

01:10:49.767 --> 01:10:52.338
What do you mean, "we"?
I didn't win anything.

01:10:52.487 --> 01:10:53.932
Oh, yeah, you didn't hear?

01:11:00.608 --> 01:11:02.098
What the heck is this?

01:11:02.487 --> 01:11:05.297
Open it.
This is your award ceremony.

01:11:06.087 --> 01:11:08.010
Bucky,
you didn't have to give me anything.

01:11:08.727 --> 01:11:11.173
I didn't. You won it.

01:11:12.128 --> 01:11:18.010
And now, for waitress of the year
or millennium, Kathy McGee!

01:11:21.568 --> 01:11:24.048
Oh, flip it over, read the back.

01:11:25.287 --> 01:11:28.291
"Congratulations to the
best waitress in the world.

01:11:28.448 --> 01:11:31.213
Nobody carries food better."

01:11:33.607 --> 01:11:35.291
That's you.

01:11:35.888 --> 01:11:38.858
I didn't plan on winning anything
tonight, so, you know, I just....

01:11:39.008 --> 01:11:42.808
- I thought you should get a trophy.
- Thank you, Bucky.

01:11:42.967 --> 01:11:47.211
You know,
I've never won anything before.

01:11:47.927 --> 01:11:53.093
I've never been to any
fancy award shows and....

01:11:54.727 --> 01:11:57.412
I've never had a guy
treat me like a star.

01:11:59.447 --> 01:12:03.532
And I've never had anyone
believe in me the way that you do.

01:12:04.007 --> 01:12:07.216
Yeah, of course.
You deserve it, Kathy.

01:12:19.367 --> 01:12:23.133
- What is that for?
- For being you.

01:12:25.927 --> 01:12:28.897
You know, Bucky, I was thinking...

01:12:29.888 --> 01:12:33.449
...since you've never done it
with any of the girls in your videos...

01:12:33.607 --> 01:12:38.374
...and, you know,
I've never done it, either...

01:12:40.087 --> 01:12:42.693
...I was thinking that maybe
we could do it together.

01:12:42.848 --> 01:12:47.854
- So you're a Virgo too?
- Yeah.

01:12:49.767 --> 01:12:53.169
But if we're going to do this,
then we have to be careful, okay?

01:12:53.328 --> 01:12:55.490
My mother said that protection...

01:12:55.648 --> 01:12:57.776
...is just as important for you
as it is for me.

01:12:57.927 --> 01:12:59.167
Yeah, sure, sure.

01:12:59.648 --> 01:13:04.131
- Okay. Do you have any protection?
- Do I have a knife?

01:13:31.488 --> 01:13:33.138
Try that.

01:13:47.168 --> 01:13:48.454
It fits.

01:14:01.408 --> 01:14:03.456
You've got hair too.

01:14:23.047 --> 01:14:24.651
Kathy?

01:14:28.007 --> 01:14:30.897
Kathy? Where are you, sweet pea?

01:14:31.527 --> 01:14:33.131
There you are.

01:14:33.287 --> 01:14:37.417
Good morning.
Look at you, carrying a tray like a pro.

01:14:37.568 --> 01:14:40.492
- It's not a big deal.
- Kathy....

01:14:41.527 --> 01:14:43.529
That was so great last night.

01:14:43.927 --> 01:14:46.089
With all the kissing and the cuddling...

01:14:46.727 --> 01:14:49.697
...and the pushing and the bumping.

01:14:50.887 --> 01:14:53.094
That was the best night of my life.

01:14:53.287 --> 01:14:55.176
And I'm not even talking
about the awards.

01:14:55.488 --> 01:14:59.174
I could careless about that.
I'm talking about...

01:14:59.328 --> 01:15:01.251
...just being with you.

01:15:02.407 --> 01:15:06.731
Yeah.
Yeah, it was pretty cool, I guess.

01:15:08.807 --> 01:15:12.653
You know, Bucky,
I've been thinking about it...

01:15:13.207 --> 01:15:18.088
...and last night was really
fun and everything...

01:15:18.247 --> 01:15:23.492
...and I just think, you know,
since it was my first time...

01:15:23.648 --> 01:15:27.369
...that I should explore all my options.

01:15:29.767 --> 01:15:34.489
Just really get out there and have
other experiences with other guys.

01:15:35.047 --> 01:15:37.448
Other--? Other guys?

01:15:37.808 --> 01:15:40.493
But I only want to do that with you.

01:15:40.647 --> 01:15:43.730
Yeah. We're not married, Bucky.

01:15:43.888 --> 01:15:46.892
We're young
and we should have fun.

01:15:47.047 --> 01:15:50.176
And I have to get an earlier flight
back to L.A.

01:15:50.327 --> 01:15:56.175
I picked up the dinner shift,
and I'll see you later. Okay?

01:15:56.327 --> 01:15:58.694
I don't understand.

01:16:13.527 --> 01:16:15.814
- Hello?
- Hey, up and at them, sunshine.

01:16:15.968 --> 01:16:19.336
Me and J. Day have been at the airport
all night trying to outrun airplanes.

01:16:19.488 --> 01:16:21.377
Come on,
meet us downstairs for breakfast.

01:16:21.527 --> 01:16:23.689
I've got breakfast up here.

01:16:23.847 --> 01:16:26.691
Fuck that. Let's go, down.

01:16:30.087 --> 01:16:31.851
We're not stopping now, Bucky.

01:16:32.167 --> 01:16:34.090
This is only the beginning.

01:16:34.727 --> 01:16:36.172
Kathy left this morning.

01:16:36.327 --> 01:16:40.616
That's what chicks do. They leave.
That's how this shit works.

01:16:40.768 --> 01:16:44.773
They're whores. Except Blueberry.

01:16:46.407 --> 01:16:49.138
- We are taking it to the next level.
- Oh, yes.

01:16:49.287 --> 01:16:52.291
J. Day is producing
all of our movies now.

01:16:52.448 --> 01:16:56.169
He paid off the mafia and he wants
to put you under an exclusive deal.

01:16:56.327 --> 01:16:58.807
Men don't want to live
in the shadows anymore.

01:16:58.967 --> 01:17:00.935
They want to look down
at their baby dick...

01:17:01.088 --> 01:17:03.489
...and pee and bang and be happy.

01:17:03.648 --> 01:17:06.333
We think that, in our new movies,
what you should do...

01:17:06.487 --> 01:17:09.616
...is you should
actually have sex with the girls.

01:17:10.247 --> 01:17:12.249
But what about
what we've been doing?

01:17:12.407 --> 01:17:16.890
The world's wondering if you can even
get inside someone with that thing.

01:17:17.767 --> 01:17:20.373
- But Kathy. I--
- Kathy's gone, man.

01:17:20.528 --> 01:17:22.610
She's gone. She told you so.

01:17:22.768 --> 01:17:26.090
She's probably on the plane right now,
fucking another guy on her way home.

01:17:26.247 --> 01:17:30.889
Yes, she's probably banging the pilot
like crazy. "Kathy," you know?

01:17:35.927 --> 01:17:38.168
Hey, Bucky, Bucky, Bucky.

01:17:38.887 --> 01:17:41.288
This is about you now.

01:17:41.447 --> 01:17:43.336
You gotta look to the future, man.

01:17:45.447 --> 01:17:48.018
- Let's have a toast.
- Let's drink to you, Bucky.

01:17:48.167 --> 01:17:49.453
You're the big--

01:17:51.207 --> 01:17:54.575
I'm sorry. I think I just jizzed on you.

01:17:55.328 --> 01:18:00.175
- I'm a lucky Internet chipmunk.
- Come on, show some respect, Dick.

01:18:00.327 --> 01:18:02.853
That's a joke, J. Day.

01:18:03.527 --> 01:18:05.768
Why don't you show some respect
to our industry?

01:18:05.927 --> 01:18:07.338
Or to your manhood?

01:18:07.488 --> 01:18:10.571
- You fucking wannabes.
- Come on, Dick.

01:18:11.527 --> 01:18:13.734
Nothing grows in my cock-shade.

01:18:15.687 --> 01:18:17.257
Nothing.

01:18:18.208 --> 01:18:20.210
Do you know what grows
in your cock-shade?

01:18:20.368 --> 01:18:23.417
A field of baby dicks.

01:18:24.007 --> 01:18:25.930
I just still can't believe it, Pop.

01:18:26.087 --> 01:18:29.216
I tried to call her.
She didn't even answer the phone.

01:18:29.367 --> 01:18:32.018
I don't know.
She seemed like a good egg.

01:18:32.167 --> 01:18:34.898
She was a beautiful egg.

01:18:35.207 --> 01:18:37.096
Painted gold.

01:18:38.208 --> 01:18:41.132
Laid by a diamond goose.

01:18:41.287 --> 01:18:45.770
Now, look, son, you gotta buck up.
You have to power through this.

01:18:45.927 --> 01:18:48.578
You got a big movie to shoot.
That's why you're out there.

01:18:53.607 --> 01:18:55.655
Suck it, whore!

01:19:03.808 --> 01:19:06.652
The weather is a little bit windy....

01:19:07.888 --> 01:19:10.494
- Here you go, Uncle Miles.
- What the hell are you doing?

01:19:11.127 --> 01:19:12.128
You said you wanted--

01:19:12.288 --> 01:19:15.576
I'm about to direct the biggest movie
of my career. I don't wanna be high.

01:19:15.728 --> 01:19:17.378
I want to be focused.

01:19:17.527 --> 01:19:19.529
She moved out of your complex?

01:19:20.567 --> 01:19:22.490
She won't even see me at her job.

01:19:23.408 --> 01:19:26.218
That's heavy, man.
I had a man leave me once.

01:19:27.047 --> 01:19:30.847
One night, after he fucked me,
he told me the smell is so brutal...

01:19:31.008 --> 01:19:34.649
...that he break up with me.
And we were in love too.

01:19:35.328 --> 01:19:38.252
But he said that the fumes
from my backside...

01:19:38.407 --> 01:19:41.934
...that they make him gag
and that they give him nightmares.

01:19:42.487 --> 01:19:45.377
And he said
that the sweat from my ass...

01:19:45.527 --> 01:19:47.689
...it could be used
as a chemical weapon.

01:19:48.528 --> 01:19:50.735
So I tried cleaning it
and scrubbing it.

01:19:50.887 --> 01:19:52.173
I used a car freshener.

01:19:52.327 --> 01:19:55.058
Nothing.
I tried eating only pineapple.

01:19:55.207 --> 01:19:59.292
- What the fuck are you doing?
- Nothing. Just talking about the movie.

01:19:59.447 --> 01:20:03.338
There's no talking. Get the fuck out
of his head. Get out of here!

01:20:06.128 --> 01:20:08.335
Come on.
Stand up, let me see the duds.

01:20:14.807 --> 01:20:16.809
Good. Good, good. Perfect.

01:20:16.967 --> 01:20:18.651
- Hey, Miles?
- Yeah, Buck?

01:20:21.127 --> 01:20:22.731
I just wanted to say thanks.

01:20:23.927 --> 01:20:26.692
Thanks for bringing me my dreams.

01:20:26.848 --> 01:20:28.657
And for being my friend.

01:20:28.807 --> 01:20:32.016
- Of course, Bucky.
- And my folks thank you too.

01:20:32.167 --> 01:20:34.898
They know how tough
this town can be...

01:20:35.447 --> 01:20:39.452
...and to have someone that's in your
corner and that cares about you...

01:20:39.607 --> 01:20:41.257
...is real nice.

01:20:55.367 --> 01:20:57.734
This rock is boiling, Miles.
Can we go?

01:20:57.888 --> 01:20:58.969
Relax.

01:20:59.127 --> 01:21:02.415
You know how many girls
would love to be tied to a hot rock...

01:21:02.567 --> 01:21:06.413
...waiting for Bucky Larson
to try and put it in them?

01:21:07.207 --> 01:21:11.053
We are rolling. Er-action!

01:21:11.808 --> 01:21:17.053
The sun is beating down on me.
I'm losing my mind.

01:21:17.207 --> 01:21:20.654
Oh, no! It's Fucky Bucky.

01:21:20.807 --> 01:21:23.777
Don't touch me, you dirty man.

01:21:25.808 --> 01:21:29.779
Oh, no.
The wind just blew my clothes off.

01:21:34.928 --> 01:21:36.418
She's good actress.

01:21:39.527 --> 01:21:42.656
Come on, buddy. Pound her.

01:21:58.247 --> 01:21:59.533
Cut!

01:22:06.848 --> 01:22:10.773
- I can't let you do this, Buck.
- Why, what happened?

01:22:12.727 --> 01:22:14.570
I got a confession to make, Bucky.

01:22:16.567 --> 01:22:20.288
Kathy didn't leave you on her own.
I told her to do it.

01:22:20.807 --> 01:22:23.697
- What?
- That morning in Las Vegas...

01:22:23.847 --> 01:22:26.168
...at the hotel,
we'd been up partying all night...

01:22:26.327 --> 01:22:29.536
...and J. Day gave me the news
about our new deal.

01:22:29.687 --> 01:22:33.134
And I ran into Kathy in the restaurant
and she was so happy...

01:22:33.287 --> 01:22:37.531
...but I was so fucked up,
I told her about our new plan...

01:22:37.687 --> 01:22:39.769
...to have you bang the chicks.

01:22:41.207 --> 01:22:46.088
She looked horrified.
She said you'd never want to do that.

01:22:46.247 --> 01:22:47.578
I just lost it.

01:22:47.728 --> 01:22:50.334
I told her that this is why
you come out here.

01:22:50.487 --> 01:22:51.648
This was your destiny.

01:22:51.808 --> 01:22:54.778
And that she'd be selfish
if she stood in your way.

01:22:54.928 --> 01:22:59.968
She started to cry
and I said to her that...

01:23:00.247 --> 01:23:03.171
...if she cared about you...

01:23:03.328 --> 01:23:06.969
...that she'd cut you loose
and let you be great.

01:23:09.767 --> 01:23:12.452
I had no right to do that.

01:23:13.767 --> 01:23:14.893
She loved you.

01:23:16.167 --> 01:23:18.534
You meant the world to her.

01:23:19.687 --> 01:23:22.577
And I don't want to see you
make the same mistakes I did.

01:23:26.208 --> 01:23:28.449
You need to go to Kathy.

01:23:28.848 --> 01:23:31.215
You need to go right now.

01:23:37.968 --> 01:23:39.936
I forgive you, Miles.

01:23:45.207 --> 01:23:48.256
I'm gonna go tell her.
I'm gonna tell her right now.

01:24:01.008 --> 01:24:05.058
- Miles, where's he going?
- He's gone, J. Day.

01:24:05.207 --> 01:24:06.891
But I need that horse!

01:24:07.047 --> 01:24:10.369
He's the star of another movie
I'm doing in Germany.

01:24:11.047 --> 01:24:13.254
Horse-cock Island.

01:24:32.087 --> 01:24:33.612
God gave me a magic wand.

01:24:33.767 --> 01:24:35.929
Why wouldn't I want to cast
love spells?

01:24:36.727 --> 01:24:39.128
You are the most aggressive person
I have ever met.

01:24:39.287 --> 01:24:41.289
It's ridiculous.

01:24:41.927 --> 01:24:45.056
Is it ridiculous how much pleasure
I could bring to your smell garden?

01:24:46.048 --> 01:24:48.335
Trust me.
I would be the best you ever had.

01:24:48.487 --> 01:24:51.457
Dick, you are a dick.

01:24:51.607 --> 01:24:54.372
You know why Bucky Larson
is a bigger star than you now?

01:24:55.367 --> 01:24:59.292
Because he showed people that it
wasn't about having a giant wiener...

01:24:59.447 --> 01:25:01.131
...swinging between your legs.

01:25:01.767 --> 01:25:05.249
It's about being a beautiful
and caring partner.

01:25:06.407 --> 01:25:09.616
And even though
it broke my heart in two...

01:25:10.327 --> 01:25:15.128
...I knew it was more important for him
to continue helping the world...

01:25:15.287 --> 01:25:17.608
...than for me to have happiness.

01:25:20.048 --> 01:25:22.733
So you know
what you need to do now?

01:25:24.087 --> 01:25:25.896
Give you some good rebound sex?

01:25:26.048 --> 01:25:28.528
Let you swing on my sweet meat?

01:25:29.088 --> 01:25:30.738
No. You need to leave.

01:25:31.408 --> 01:25:32.898
Look who's back.

01:25:33.047 --> 01:25:36.813
Kathy, I remember the first time
I saw you at the diner.

01:25:36.967 --> 01:25:40.688
My heart stopped.
My stomach felt funny.

01:25:40.848 --> 01:25:42.691
I thought I had the flu.

01:25:43.968 --> 01:25:47.575
But I didn't. It was you.

01:25:48.327 --> 01:25:52.218
Being in those nude movies,
that's not my destiny.

01:25:52.368 --> 01:25:53.779
Being with you is.

01:25:55.447 --> 01:25:56.812
You make my heart smile.

01:25:56.967 --> 01:26:00.016
- Does your heart have buck teeth too?
- Shut your cock.

01:26:03.847 --> 01:26:07.932
What I'm trying to say is
I love you, Kathy.

01:26:08.407 --> 01:26:09.852
I love you too, Bucky.

01:26:16.727 --> 01:26:19.128
- Will you do me a favour?
- Yeah.

01:26:19.287 --> 01:26:22.814
Will you give me a ride home
to Iowa?

01:26:23.767 --> 01:26:24.973
With honours.

01:26:35.767 --> 01:26:37.929
I smell a garden.

01:26:44.007 --> 01:26:46.578
Ride, little dick. Ride.

01:27:15.927 --> 01:27:20.137
- Do I have chips in my teeth?
- No, you don't have any teeth.

01:27:20.288 --> 01:27:23.337
- Jeremiah.
- Well, she doesn't.

01:27:23.488 --> 01:27:24.489
Oh, my.

01:27:24.647 --> 01:27:26.809
Table 17.
And thank you for coming.

01:27:26.967 --> 01:27:29.618
Hey, best steaks
and service in the state, Bucky.

01:27:29.767 --> 01:27:31.007
That's my wife's doing.

01:27:31.168 --> 01:27:34.490
Hey, honey, there's a table in back,
wants to take a picture with you.

01:27:34.647 --> 01:27:38.049
Yeah, sure. Jeez, how many bowls
you got there?

01:27:38.208 --> 01:27:41.291
- Seven. It's my new record.
- No way.

01:27:43.488 --> 01:27:45.570
You owe me rent money, fucker!

01:27:45.728 --> 01:27:48.459
- Gary, no!
- You're just like John Mayer!

01:27:48.608 --> 01:27:50.258
Just like John Mayer.
