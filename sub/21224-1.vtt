11:16.744 --> 11:18.979
moving up 15 spots in the Draft
to get your man

11:19.012 --> 11:22.916
would be enough drama
for an entire off-season.

11:22.950 --> 11:27.187
But the trade was only the Rams'
second-biggest move of 2016.

and something

the right decision.

"Oh, y'all moving?

11:58.185 --> 12:00.220
Are y'all moving?"
I'm like, "Man, I have no idea.

when everybody else did,

And, you know, from there,
it was just a go.

After all, the Rams did play
there for almost 50 years.

Keenum was a college superstar.

He still holds the NCAA record

18:11.224 --> 18:13.326

the big numbers end.

18:17.430 --> 18:19.132
At 6'1",

18:19.166 --> 18:21.834
he's not quite tall enough
for most NFL experts,

18:21.868 --> 18:23.903
so Keenum has mostly
been a backup,

18:23.936 --> 18:28.408
first with the Texans,
then the Rams.

18:28.441 --> 18:31.378
But when the offense
struggled last year,

18:31.411 --> 18:34.147
Keenum got the call

18:34.181 --> 18:36.549
and played well as a starter,

18:36.583 --> 18:38.818
leading the Rams
to three wins in four games

18:38.851 --> 18:43.290
to finish out the 2015 season.

18:43.323 --> 18:45.858

Keenum is the starter.

was who will be
handing off to Gurley --

The expectation after the draft

27:52.204 --> 27:54.340
was that Jared Goff
would be the guy,

as an organization is say,

You just can't do that.

with it before

28:43.990 --> 28:46.392

In fact, the rookie won't even
dress against the 49ers.

32:57.243 --> 32:59.711
It's great to be back.

32:59.745 --> 33:02.548
So here's to
beating the Niners.

Our Father, who art in heaven,

33:17.096 --> 33:19.165
hallowed by thy name,
thy kingdom come,

33:19.198 --> 33:21.100
thy will be done on earth
as it is in heaven.

33:21.133 --> 33:22.334
Give us this day
our daily bread,

33:22.368 --> 33:23.735
forgive us our trespass

33:23.769 --> 33:25.671
as we forgive
those who trespass against us.

33:25.704 --> 33:28.674
Lead us not into temptation,
but deliver us from evil.

33:28.707 --> 33:29.741
Thine is the king, the power,
and the Lord forever, amen.

We are so glad to have you

33:39.318 --> 33:42.421
for the 50th season
of Rams football in L.A.

33:42.454 --> 33:46.525
and the first since 1994.

33:46.558 --> 33:48.260
Fisher: Here's the deal.

33:48.294 --> 33:50.429
You guys are ready to play.

33:50.462 --> 33:53.199
Wear on them and wear on them
and wear on them.

33:53.232 --> 33:55.834
Just wear on their...ass.
O-line, kick their ass.

33:55.867 --> 33:58.070
Defense, D-line, you guys know
what you got to do.

33:58.104 --> 33:59.671
Let's just go do it.
Go...do it.

33:59.705 --> 34:02.274
Trust what you've learned,
trust your instincts,

34:02.308 --> 34:03.809
and let's put this all together.

Announcer: What better way
to usher in a new era

34:09.315 --> 34:12.251
of Los Angeles Rams football

34:12.284 --> 34:15.321
than with
the San Francisco 49ers?

34:15.354 --> 34:16.822
Jared Goff,

34:16.855 --> 34:19.425
the number-one overall
selection, will not dress.

34:19.458 --> 34:23.462
Case Keenum taking a
regular-season snap in September

34:23.495 --> 34:26.498
for the first time
in his career.

34:26.532 --> 34:30.336
88 Z around, false pit,
on the freeze. Ready?

34:30.369 --> 34:34.306
From the 11-yard line,
it's third down and 8.

34:34.340 --> 34:36.375
Keenum's in the shotgun.

34:36.408 --> 34:38.544
He takes a waist-high snap.

34:38.577 --> 34:41.613
And he is dropped inside his 5.

34:43.215 --> 34:44.550
Hut, hut.

34:44.583 --> 34:45.884
Announcer #2:
The San Francisco 49ers

34:45.917 --> 34:47.419
are sending blitzes
all over the place.

34:47.453 --> 34:49.155
They're getting penetration.
-Hut, hut!

34:49.188 --> 34:51.123
Guys are being unblocked.

34:51.157 --> 34:53.792
A lot of missed assignments by
this offensive line right now.

34:53.825 --> 34:56.528
[ Cheers and applause ]

34:56.562 --> 34:58.130
Green, hut, hut!

34:58.164 --> 35:01.300
This -- this is not
a good showing right now.

35:01.333 --> 35:02.701
I guarantee you Gregg Williams

35:02.734 --> 35:04.270
is probably screaming
and throwing stuff,

35:04.303 --> 35:07.573
saying,
"We're not doing our job."

35:07.606 --> 35:08.907
This is what happens

35:08.940 --> 35:10.742
when your defense
is on the field all night.

35:10.776 --> 35:12.411
Left, Brock!
Left, Brock!

35:12.444 --> 35:14.446
They get tired,
and all of a sudden,

35:14.480 --> 35:17.316
you get a big play.

Announcer: Touchdown, 49ers!

35:23.555 --> 35:27.893

remember to keep their cool.

Case: Hut, hut!

35:29.595 --> 35:31.763
Announcer: Rams looking to
break up this shutout.

35:31.797 --> 35:34.300
They throw down the seam,
and it's picked.

35:44.376 --> 35:47.179
-I thought he was out.
-I thought he was out, too.

35:47.213 --> 35:51.250
No, it was definitely zone.
It's just, what kind of zone?

35:51.283 --> 35:53.185
No, hey.

35:53.219 --> 35:54.453
Announcer #2: You don't need to
look on a tablet

35:54.486 --> 35:57.656
to find out
what's going on here.

35:57.689 --> 35:59.825
If the Rams are gonna
get something going,

35:59.858 --> 36:01.893
it's gonna be Case Keenum's
gonna figure out

36:01.927 --> 36:05.431
a way to get into this defense.

36:05.464 --> 36:07.866
This horizontal game,
quick screens and passes

36:07.899 --> 36:11.570
is not gonna get the job done.
There's no chance.

36:11.603 --> 36:12.871
Gurley:
We gonna make something happen.

36:12.904 --> 36:15.207
We gonna make something happen,
now.

36:15.241 --> 36:16.575
We gonna make
something happen, baby.

36:16.608 --> 36:19.245
Oh, yeah.

36:19.278 --> 36:20.946
Hamm:
After all the moves and miles

36:20.979 --> 36:23.349
and planning and practicing,

36:23.382 --> 36:27.886
the Rams' opening night
is a flop.

36:27.919 --> 36:32.358
Announcer: It's now fourth down
and a short 2 from the 34.

36:32.391 --> 36:34.993
Gurley, straight-ahead running,
he picks it up.

36:35.026 --> 36:38.364
First down Rams
in 49ers' territory.

36:39.798 --> 36:42.568
Todd Gurley tossed the ball
about 6 yards downfield

36:42.601 --> 36:44.736
to the 49ers safety
with his left hand,

36:44.770 --> 36:46.605
and he was flagged.

36:46.638 --> 36:49.508
So the reining offensive rookie
of the year Todd Gurley

36:49.541 --> 36:54.313
gets the first down,
but also gets the personal foul.

36:54.346 --> 36:56.382
Hamm: It's a tough night.

36:56.415 --> 36:57.883
But when Alec Ogletree takes

36:57.916 --> 37:01.353
a hard tackle
just a little too far,

37:01.387 --> 37:03.555
the night unravels.

37:03.589 --> 37:05.624
Announcer: And there are some
extracurricular activities

37:05.657 --> 37:08.360
as Ogletree gets mixed up
with Torrey Smith.

37:08.394 --> 37:10.262
Alec: I ain't do that.

37:10.296 --> 37:11.730
Announcer:
And it was Quinton Patton
was in there talking,

37:11.763 --> 37:13.632
then Aaron Donald grabs him.

37:13.665 --> 37:16.568
And with two hands, just knocks
his helmet right off his head.

37:16.602 --> 37:19.905
Then everyone starts
grabbing Aaron Donald.

37:19.938 --> 37:23.375
And he bumps into the official
is what it looked like.

37:23.409 --> 37:27.313
Man: Unsportsmanlike conduct,
contact with an official,

37:27.346 --> 37:30.282

37:30.316 --> 37:33.719
Half the distance to the goal,
automatic first down.

37:33.752 --> 37:37.589
Number 99 has been disqualified.

37:42.894 --> 37:44.863
Announcer: Aaron Donald ejected,

37:44.896 --> 37:47.366
and there's your night
for the Rams.

37:50.502 --> 37:52.070
Announcer #2: You know, really
the best players

37:52.103 --> 37:53.872
on each side
of the ball tonight,

37:53.905 --> 37:56.608
Todd Gurley and Aaron Donald,
have each lost their cool,

37:56.642 --> 37:58.977
and it's proven to be
costly for the Rams.

38:01.880 --> 38:05.717
Yeah, but we still -- we still
got to keep our composure, man.

38:05.751 --> 38:08.854
We still got to
keep our composure.

on your chest for a reason, bro.

You know what I mean?

38:26.705 --> 38:29.841
That...y'all know exactly
what y'all need to do, so...

38:29.875 --> 38:31.910
It's game 1.
We got to get through this...

38:31.943 --> 38:35.080
but don't worry about it.
We got a long...season.

38:35.113 --> 38:36.882
And I promise you that...
will never happen again, bro.

38:36.915 --> 38:39.050
Don't worry.
That...will
never happen again.

38:39.084 --> 38:42.053
Yeah.
That...ain't
gonna never happen again.

38:42.087 --> 38:43.855
We gonna bounce back.

Announcer:
Talking to the Rams yesterday,

38:47.993 --> 38:49.795
coming out of all the travel

38:49.828 --> 38:52.464
and all the places
that they've been since January,

38:52.498 --> 38:54.666
different training camps
that they've been to,

38:54.700 --> 38:58.537
you thought Jeff Fisher
has worked this out,

38:58.570 --> 39:00.606
and these guys should be tired
and distracted.

39:00.639 --> 39:02.408
They acted like a team
that wasn't,

39:02.441 --> 39:06.044
but they've played tonight
like a team that's distracted.

39:06.077 --> 39:09.114
**

39:11.082 --> 39:14.853
Fisher: There's no excuses.

39:14.886 --> 39:17.889
I don't want this last
six months and this movement

39:17.923 --> 39:20.426
and all that...
to have people say that,

39:20.459 --> 39:22.060
"Oh, we just couldn't
overcome it."

39:22.093 --> 39:25.831
No.
We have to move on.

39:25.864 --> 39:29.034
So turn to each other
and let's come back

39:29.067 --> 39:31.770
and get ready to win
a football game.

39:36.041 --> 39:37.776
We got some work to do,
obviously.

39:37.809 --> 39:40.045
Very disappointed
in the outcome.

39:40.078 --> 39:44.182
15 other teams
lost this weekend.

39:44.215 --> 39:46.818
Some of them are pretty good.

39:46.852 --> 39:48.153
I happen to think these guys

39:48.186 --> 39:49.721
in this locker room
are pretty good.

39:49.755 --> 39:51.890
So, you know,
if I'd have seen it coming,

39:51.923 --> 39:53.825
you know, we'd have
done something different.

39:53.859 --> 39:55.193
I thought we were doing
everything right.

39:55.226 --> 39:58.029
So -- we will this week, though.

39:58.063 --> 39:59.865
Okay? Thank you.

40:06.071 --> 40:08.574
[ Applause ]
Long:
Well, good evening, everyone,

40:08.607 --> 40:10.075
and welcome to
the "Jeff Fisher Show"

40:10.108 --> 40:11.977
on ESPN L.A. 710,

40:12.010 --> 40:15.747
live from Bogie's
at the Westlake Village Inn.

40:15.781 --> 40:17.816
What has the day been like
for you and your camp?

40:17.849 --> 40:19.885
Fisher:
Well, it's a challenge.

40:19.918 --> 40:21.953
We have what we call
a 24-hour rule.

40:21.987 --> 40:25.724
And so we give
the players 24 hours.

40:25.757 --> 40:27.025
Once you get through
that period,

40:27.058 --> 40:28.794
you're on to the next game.

40:28.827 --> 40:32.564
And so I actually
cut it down to 22.

40:32.598 --> 40:33.932
-Short week.
-Yeah.

40:33.965 --> 40:36.635
I cut it down to 22
'cause it's a short week.

40:36.668 --> 40:39.638
Aaron Donald, he seems like
a wonderful person.

40:39.671 --> 40:41.507
But his emotions
boiled over last night.

40:41.540 --> 40:43.542
-Yeah!
-And what did you say to Aaron?

40:43.575 --> 40:45.243
You know, Aaron needs
to keep his composure.

40:45.276 --> 40:48.547
It's uncharacteristic of him,
and it will never happen again.

40:48.580 --> 40:50.516
And, you know,
you watched the game.

40:50.549 --> 40:53.652
-Mm-hmm.
-He had an outstanding game

40:53.685 --> 40:55.186
in there
against those guys.

40:55.220 --> 40:58.089
Their whole game plan
was based on where Aaron was,

40:58.123 --> 41:00.626
yet he was still
making plays.

41:05.564 --> 41:08.266
Donald: You go into a season
with so much high expectations,

41:08.299 --> 41:11.002
and then things don't turn out
how you want to.

41:11.036 --> 41:13.872
And one thing leads to another,
and you make bonehead decisions

41:13.905 --> 41:15.741
and do something
to hurt your team.

41:15.774 --> 41:18.977
And that's what I did, you know,
but I just put so much time

41:19.010 --> 41:20.812
into this game, you know.

41:20.846 --> 41:22.914
Sometimes your emotions
take the best of you.

41:25.917 --> 41:30.188
I usually come in early
and at least try to get an hour,

41:30.221 --> 41:33.091
hour in before meetings
to watch film.

41:33.124 --> 41:35.627
Sometimes I might stay after
and watch a couple --

41:35.661 --> 41:38.029
a little bit more.

41:38.063 --> 41:40.632
This is probably my third or
fourth time watching this game.

41:40.666 --> 41:42.801
Right now, I'm just trying
to find tendencies

41:42.834 --> 41:46.938
that the offensive line
is giving, just little tips.

41:46.972 --> 41:49.307
When I'm at home,
I'm usually watching film, too.

41:49.340 --> 41:50.976
During that season,
that's all I do is football.

41:51.009 --> 41:53.244
I don't do too much.
Get home, relax with the family.

41:53.278 --> 41:56.114
It's football season, so...

41:58.349 --> 42:00.318
It's just like studying
for a test.

42:00.351 --> 42:01.987
You study for the test,

42:02.020 --> 42:05.156
come game time,
you're prepared for it.

42:06.057 --> 42:09.094
**

42:16.768 --> 42:19.638
Hamm:
The Rams have to play smarter.

42:19.671 --> 42:21.306
So they're hitting
the books hard,

42:21.339 --> 42:23.074
preparing for their Week 2 game

42:23.108 --> 42:24.610
against another division rival,

42:24.643 --> 42:27.312
the Seattle Seahawks.

42:27.345 --> 42:29.615
I just had a question
on one of the...

42:29.648 --> 42:33.184
It was a saw with a gone.

42:33.218 --> 42:35.053
Announcer:
Wilson gives aside to Lynch!

42:35.086 --> 42:36.855
It's stopped!

42:36.888 --> 42:40.626
The Rams' defense wins it!

42:40.659 --> 42:43.094
Hamm:
Seattle is a perennial power,

42:43.128 --> 42:45.196
but the Rams
have beaten them three times

42:45.230 --> 42:46.998
in their last four meetings.

42:47.032 --> 42:49.801
Still, the Seahawks roster
is loaded,

42:49.835 --> 42:53.371
starting with Russell Wilson,
their dual-threat quarterback --

42:53.404 --> 42:57.609
as good with his feet
as he is with his arm.

42:57.643 --> 43:01.212
Then there's the defense.

43:01.246 --> 43:05.817
Fast, physical,
and worthy of their nickname,

43:05.851 --> 43:08.253
the Legion of Boom.

43:10.789 --> 43:13.358
-Bam!
-Good, Cory!

43:13.391 --> 43:16.995
The 24-hour rule has passed.

43:17.028 --> 43:21.633
But the shock of a nationally
televised blowout lingers.

43:21.667 --> 43:23.702
Williams: What have we said?

43:23.735 --> 43:26.705
If we would have given up
four...field goals, okay,

43:26.738 --> 43:29.407
and about 221 yards, okay,

43:29.440 --> 43:30.942
12-0 would have been different

43:30.976 --> 43:33.211
from how we're setting here
right now.

43:33.244 --> 43:35.113
Okay, this is
a good football team.

43:35.146 --> 43:37.683
You guys can be as good
as you want to be.

43:37.716 --> 43:39.384
But this is all I'm saying,
dude,

43:39.417 --> 43:41.920
we had seven
three-and-outs

43:41.953 --> 43:45.390
starting off
the second half.

43:45.423 --> 43:47.025
You can give a...
the opportunity,

43:47.058 --> 43:48.994
they're gonna find a way
to exploit it.

43:49.027 --> 43:50.095
Right.

43:53.131 --> 43:56.201
See,
it took us to get...

44:01.106 --> 44:02.407
Yeah.

44:18.890 --> 44:20.058
Yeah.

44:27.999 --> 44:29.334
You think
I like the taste?

44:29.367 --> 44:30.435
...

44:32.170 --> 44:34.139
Way too good.

44:36.775 --> 44:38.777
That's...up.

44:43.181 --> 44:45.283
Especially Friday.

44:45.316 --> 44:47.318
Or our Saturday practice,

44:47.352 --> 44:49.087
that...
was looking awesome.

45:00.031 --> 45:02.133
Only way to wash the taste
out the mouth

45:02.167 --> 45:04.335
is go get you a dub.

45:05.837 --> 45:07.505
That's the only way.

45:07.538 --> 45:10.776
**

45:13.779 --> 45:15.146
Hut, hut!

45:19.284 --> 45:21.219
Go.

45:21.252 --> 45:24.089
You punk!

45:24.122 --> 45:25.290
Nothing!

45:25.323 --> 45:27.158
All right, 20, Mike!

45:27.192 --> 45:28.894
Here we go, here we go.
Break, break.

45:28.927 --> 45:30.528
Here we go, Jamal, Jamal.

45:30.561 --> 45:33.164
Set, set, set!
Louie!

45:33.198 --> 45:37.335
Right, 20, hut, hut!

45:42.941 --> 45:45.510
Hooking me up now!
Touchdown.

45:45.543 --> 45:47.112
Good job, dude.

45:47.145 --> 45:48.780
I'm trying to take
that...all the way.

45:48.814 --> 45:52.283
-I already know.
-All the way, every time, baby.

45:55.253 --> 45:59.257
Buck: Do you feel pressure
to get the ball downfield?

45:59.290 --> 46:01.392
You know what I mean?
It seems like everything

46:01.426 --> 46:03.261
from the last few years

46:03.294 --> 46:05.130
has been around
the line of scrimmage.

46:05.163 --> 46:06.965
Do you feel like you need
to push it

46:06.998 --> 46:08.366
down the field
a little more?

46:08.399 --> 46:10.201
It's not something
that I feel pressured to.

46:10.235 --> 46:12.103
I mean, it's just
it's something I think

46:12.137 --> 46:15.006
that is good to do
to put pressure on defenses,

46:15.040 --> 46:16.174
to let them know
we have it.

46:16.207 --> 46:17.342
And when there's shots there

46:17.375 --> 46:19.177
to be taken,
we're gonna take them.

46:19.210 --> 46:21.880
Just kind of where do you go
from here, offensively?

46:21.913 --> 46:24.215
Well, we got to go up,
you know?
Yeah.

46:24.249 --> 46:25.917
I just got to trust --

46:25.951 --> 46:27.118
trust my preparation.

46:27.152 --> 46:28.386
You know,
I was in the building

46:28.419 --> 46:31.322
till 9:00 Saturday night
last week.

46:31.356 --> 46:34.025
Like, I'm gonna put
a time limit today,

46:34.059 --> 46:36.027
and I'm gonna leave, you know.

46:36.061 --> 46:37.495
I'm prepared, I know these guys.

46:37.528 --> 46:40.065
This is Seattle,
I'm gonna trust my guys,

46:40.098 --> 46:41.900
and don't over-think.

46:41.933 --> 46:44.069
You know, I don't want to say
the word "don't over-think."

46:44.102 --> 46:46.404
I like using the word "trust."
Just trust.

46:46.437 --> 46:48.940
Well, how are you gonna
get your quarterback to relax?

46:48.974 --> 46:50.942
He was in here talking,
you know.

46:50.976 --> 46:52.577
There's a lot of guys
that get uptight,

46:52.610 --> 46:54.846
but they don't normally say
they're uptight, you know?

46:54.880 --> 46:56.181
-Yeah, right.
-Yeah.

46:56.214 --> 46:58.383
No, that was our challenge
even going in.

46:58.416 --> 46:59.851
I mean,
last Saturday night,

46:59.885 --> 47:01.552
he was in here
till about 8:30, 9:00.

47:01.586 --> 47:04.189
You know you're
in trouble, you know.

47:04.222 --> 47:06.491
And that was, you know,

47:06.524 --> 47:08.393
a little formula for disaster
for all of us,

47:08.426 --> 47:10.261
just kind of over-thinking
some things.

47:10.295 --> 47:11.596
Appreciate it.

47:11.629 --> 47:13.865
Hamm: The TV crew's
well wishes are genuine.

47:13.899 --> 47:16.567
-Appreciate it.
-But they're outsiders.

47:16.601 --> 47:18.503
They won't be on
the field this Sunday.

47:18.536 --> 47:19.938
Nice to see you.

47:19.971 --> 47:22.107
And they won't be living
with the results.

47:23.174 --> 47:26.511
And Sunday is no ordinary game.

47:26.544 --> 47:29.014
It will be played
at the Coliseum,

47:29.047 --> 47:32.350
one of the grand old venues
of American sports,

47:32.383 --> 47:35.120
hosting a Rams
regular-season game

47:35.153 --> 47:39.257
for the first time
in nearly 40 years.

47:39.290 --> 47:41.192
That's one way of looking at it.

47:41.226 --> 47:43.428
Here's another.

47:43.461 --> 47:45.463
After a grueling
nine-month journey,

47:45.496 --> 47:47.966
the Rams are at a crossroads,

47:47.999 --> 47:51.136
and the Seahawks don't care.

47:51.169 --> 47:53.304
Fisher: We got plenty of time,

47:53.338 --> 47:56.341
plenty of reps
to...be ready.

47:56.374 --> 47:59.144
And guess what!
It's your responsibility,

47:59.177 --> 48:01.679
your responsibility,
your responsibility,

48:01.712 --> 48:03.214
your responsibility,

48:03.248 --> 48:08.019
your responsibility
to be...ready.

48:08.053 --> 48:09.420
After a loss like that,

48:09.454 --> 48:11.122
you're just so ready
just to get back at it.

48:11.156 --> 48:14.926
So we're gonna get a win
this week for sure.

48:14.960 --> 48:17.028
Keenum: And we need to play
with some tempo, man, 'cause...

48:17.062 --> 48:18.363
-Yeah.
-We can't let them do this,

48:18.396 --> 48:19.965
like...
-65 plays that game.

48:19.998 --> 48:22.033
Scrambled up,
Mike's left.

48:22.067 --> 48:23.301
We've been doing that
all camp.

48:23.334 --> 48:25.703
That's easy stuff.
All right, man.

48:25.736 --> 48:27.205
This is the last one.

48:27.238 --> 48:28.606
We good with that?
-Yeah.

48:28.639 --> 48:32.710
-That's it.
-Yeah, we're at home, man.

48:32.743 --> 48:36.181
Man: Let's just communicate
and heck yeah, dude.

48:36.214 --> 48:39.084
Hamm: "Home."

48:39.117 --> 48:42.120
It's been a while since the Rams
have been able to say that.

48:42.153 --> 48:46.591
**

48:46.624 --> 48:48.459
Fisher: This thing we're getting
ready to do here

48:48.493 --> 48:51.229
on Sunday is historic.

48:51.262 --> 48:53.598
That place is gonna be rocking.

48:53.631 --> 48:56.567
And the best part about it
who we're playing --

48:56.601 --> 48:58.203
and that's the Seahawks.

48:58.236 --> 49:01.572
Great week.
Great week bouncing back.

49:01.606 --> 49:03.008
I'll see you in the morning.
Good job.

49:03.041 --> 49:04.175
-Case!
-Let's go, Case.

49:04.209 --> 49:05.543
-Here we go, baby!
-Here we go.

49:05.576 --> 49:07.378
Man: All right, let's do it
together, huh?

49:07.412 --> 49:08.713
Hey, "together" on three.
One, two, three!

49:08.746 --> 49:09.981
All: Together!

49:12.750 --> 49:15.353
Hamm: On the next episode of
"All or Nothing"...

49:15.386 --> 49:16.687
LeBron James!

49:16.721 --> 49:20.091
Announcer: The Rams have
a home game in L.A.

49:20.125 --> 49:24.429
You got to ask for help?
Be a man!

49:24.462 --> 49:25.663
Whoo!

49:25.696 --> 49:27.332
Has Gurley scored
a touchdown yet?

49:27.365 --> 49:28.766
No.

49:28.799 --> 49:30.768
You're doing exactly
what we want you to do.

49:30.801 --> 49:32.637
This is good football.

49:32.670 --> 49:34.505
Man: Okay.
Easy money.

49:34.539 --> 49:37.508
Fisher: Nobody crosses our
goal line. Make sure.

49:37.542 --> 49:39.310
Announcer: The field and
the stands had to be evacuated

49:39.344 --> 49:40.711
because of a weather alert.

49:40.745 --> 49:42.580
-We're gonna be here an hour.
-Let's go.

49:42.613 --> 49:44.515
All we got to do is keep them
out of the end zone, baby.

49:44.549 --> 49:48.219
Announcer: So here we go,
the final snap of the game.
