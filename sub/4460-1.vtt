00:47.756 --> 00:49.424
Cut his ass.

00:49.633 --> 00:52.845
- [Grunting]
- Go! Now let's go!

00:52.970 --> 00:54.847
[Shouting]

00:56.390 --> 00:59.309
- Heads up!
- [Grunting]

01:02.980 --> 01:05.274
[Man] Take him down!
That's it, that's it!

01:07.359 --> 01:11.613
- Hey, Coach, how you been?
- [Laughing] Lynn Swann.

01:11.738 --> 01:13.699
Now, why ain't I surprised...

01:13.824 --> 01:16.618
to see you snoopin' around my
football field first day of practice?

01:16.827 --> 01:18.620
Well, that's because you got
a good-lookin' football team.

01:18.704 --> 01:22.374
Maybe good enough to add another
national championship trophy
to the old case downstairs.

01:22.457 --> 01:25.377
That's kinda like my old man
told me one time, Lynn.

01:25.502 --> 01:31.008
"The only thing better than a crawfish
dinner is five crawfish dinners."

01:38.724 --> 01:40.726
Hey, here comes
the shithead.

02:03.248 --> 02:05.334
It's clean.

02:05.542 --> 02:07.711
It's cold.

02:07.836 --> 02:11.381
Now that's what I call
high-quality H20. 0h!

02:11.465 --> 02:14.384
0oh!
Right in the head!

02:15.761 --> 02:18.138
It's over there!

02:22.017 --> 02:26.605
Any unused magic in that
legendary green playbook of yours, Red?

02:28.065 --> 02:30.859
I may have a couple
squirrelled away in there...

02:30.984 --> 02:34.738
for a rainy day.

02:34.947 --> 02:37.741
[Players Yelling]

02:50.879 --> 02:53.298
See what we got here.

02:58.595 --> 03:03.809
- Not exactly what I'd call
constructive criticism.
- [Whistle Blowing]

03:03.934 --> 03:06.436
- Smell like you could use
a shower, stinky.
- 0h!

03:06.645 --> 03:09.857
Listen, you-you could think what you
want a-about my personal hygiene,

03:10.065 --> 03:12.067
but, please,
don't-don't waste any water.

03:12.276 --> 03:16.113
That-That's bad policy. If you
need to amuse yourself at my expense,

03:16.238 --> 03:18.949
just-just rough me up
or something.

03:19.032 --> 03:21.743
- Fair enough.
- [Groaning]

03:21.952 --> 03:25.289
- [Laughter]
- [Sighing]

03:25.414 --> 03:27.499
[Waterboy Mumbling]

03:27.708 --> 03:30.919
Laski, get over here!

03:31.044 --> 03:33.422
- Yes, sir, Coach?
- [Sighing]

03:33.547 --> 03:35.716
What is that moron
doin' here? Huh, huh?

03:35.841 --> 03:39.803
Didn't I tell you as plain as I could
speak to get rid of his ass last year?

03:40.012 --> 03:43.640
Yes, sir, but I didn't think
you were serious, Coach.
Besides, he does a great job.

03:43.765 --> 03:46.685
Disrupting my football team,
you idiot?

03:46.894 --> 03:50.230
Eighteen years of this
is enough!

03:50.314 --> 03:52.816
Hey, Waterboy!

03:52.941 --> 03:54.818
Yes, Mr Coach Beaulieu!

03:54.902 --> 03:58.363
You're fired!

03:58.572 --> 04:00.324
0kay.

04:06.580 --> 04:08.457
[Man]
Get out of the way, you moron!

04:08.582 --> 04:11.793
- When I was just
a little boy -

04:12.836 --> 04:15.756
- I stood up to
my daddy's knee -

04:16.923 --> 04:20.344
- My papa said, son
don't let the man get ya -

04:20.469 --> 04:23.263
- And do what he done to me -

04:25.140 --> 04:28.393
- - Born on the bayou -
- 0h.

04:28.477 --> 04:32.356
- Born on the bayou...

04:35.692 --> 04:40.155
Bobby Boucher,
come give your mama a kiss.

04:40.364 --> 04:42.866
- Hi, Steve.
- [Braying]

04:44.868 --> 04:48.205
0h. Why you home so early,
my precious angel?

04:48.413 --> 04:51.834
Mama, s-somethin' bad
happened today.

04:51.959 --> 04:55.796
Somebody hurt you, my boy? Who hurt
you? You tell Mama who hurt you.

04:55.921 --> 04:57.798
Nobody, Mama.
It's just that...

04:57.881 --> 05:01.844
I lost my position as the team's
water distribution engineer.

05:01.969 --> 05:05.514
Why, that's the best news
I heard in a dog's age.

05:05.597 --> 05:08.725
Now you be able to spend your days
at home where you belong.

05:08.934 --> 05:11.228
Yes, but...

05:11.436 --> 05:14.773
l-I was... I was thinkin', Mama,
maybe l-I could...

05:14.898 --> 05:18.861
I could try to-to get another
waterboy job for-for a different team.

05:19.069 --> 05:21.363
Don't you raise your voice
to me, Bobby Boucher.

05:21.446 --> 05:24.283
l-I wasn't raising
my voice, Mama.

05:24.491 --> 05:27.202
I don't like confrontation
'cause I'm a Virgo.

05:28.453 --> 05:30.205
Who told you
you was a Virgo?

05:31.456 --> 05:34.168
Vicki Vallencourt,
that-that-that-that girl.

05:34.376 --> 05:37.296
A girl?

05:37.421 --> 05:41.383
Bobby Boucher! Don't you remember
what your mama told you about girls?

05:41.592 --> 05:43.343
I remember, Mama.

05:45.429 --> 05:48.974
A girl was so nice out at
Wasser's Creek this morning.

05:49.099 --> 05:52.853
- Really?
- We looked for crawfish together.
Her's name's Vicki.

05:52.936 --> 05:55.439
I don't ever want you
associatin' with little girls.

05:55.564 --> 05:59.610
- Why not, Mama?
- Because little girls are the devil!

05:59.818 --> 06:02.654
Mama, it-it's just
that I'm a waterboy.

06:02.863 --> 06:04.948
The team gets thirsty,
and I bring them the water.

06:05.032 --> 06:07.743
They-They need the water, and I likes
to be the one that brings it to them.

06:07.868 --> 06:11.413
Yeah. They like to give you a boot
in the patoot for all your trouble.

06:11.622 --> 06:16.710
Bobby, you don't have what they call
"the social skills."

06:16.835 --> 06:21.924
People don't understand you.
That's why you never have any
friends, except for your mama.

06:22.049 --> 06:26.094
All I know is this, Jimmy:
Next Friday, August 29,
at the Baton Rouge Exposition Center,

06:26.220 --> 06:28.722
I'm gonna open a can
of whoop-ass on Herculon,

06:28.805 --> 06:31.433
and I'm gonna drive him back into
whatever galaxy it is he came from.

06:31.642 --> 06:34.228
And that's a promise!

06:34.353 --> 06:38.607
Strong words from a strong man,
Captain Insano.

06:38.732 --> 06:42.694
Now let's take a call. It's our
old friend from Jackson's Bayou, Mr B.

06:42.903 --> 06:44.863
Hello, Jim.

06:44.988 --> 06:48.408
l-ls it possible
to speak to Captain Insano?

06:48.617 --> 06:50.702
- Shoot, Mr B.
- Captain Insano,

06:50.827 --> 06:53.205
I notice sometimes
when you are wrestling...

06:53.330 --> 06:56.750
or-or openin' up a can of whoop-ass,
as you like to say...

06:56.875 --> 07:00.212
- You seem to be sweating
quite profusely.
- Yeah?

07:00.420 --> 07:03.131
I was wondering if,
perhaps, you might need...

07:03.340 --> 07:06.468
the services
of an experienced waterboy.

07:06.677 --> 07:09.596
[Chuckling]
That's pretty cute.

07:09.680 --> 07:11.890
How old are you, kid?
Eleven, twelve?

07:12.099 --> 07:13.851
l-I am 31 years old.

07:16.270 --> 07:18.647
[Both Laughing]

07:24.069 --> 07:26.488
[Captain Insano]
I guarantee, that guy's still a virgin.

07:26.572 --> 07:28.574
0h! 0h, my God!

07:28.657 --> 07:31.910
[Laughing Continues]

07:32.119 --> 07:34.413
[Engine Whirring]

07:55.684 --> 07:57.853
- My mama said -

07:57.978 --> 08:01.190
- That your life
is a gift -

08:01.398 --> 08:03.400
- And my mama said -

08:03.483 --> 08:07.154
- This much weight
you will lift -

08:07.237 --> 08:11.408
- And my mama said
leave those bad boys alone -

08:12.784 --> 08:15.579
- And my mama said...

08:15.787 --> 08:19.249
This is where
they strip the ball from us.

08:19.458 --> 08:23.504
And then we miss one tackle.
There, two tackles.

08:23.629 --> 08:25.923
Joey drops the ball.

08:26.006 --> 08:29.468
Whoops, he has time
to pick it up and dust it off
and run in for a touchdown...

08:29.676 --> 08:33.096
before our guys even know
what's goin' on.

08:34.765 --> 08:38.101
- [Sighing]
- [Knocking]

08:40.520 --> 08:42.688
- Hello?
- My name is Bobby Boucher.

08:42.813 --> 08:46.568
And I am inquiring as to whether
you have the need for
an experienced waterboy...

08:46.777 --> 08:48.946
on your upcoming season.

08:49.071 --> 08:51.448
Nice suit.

08:51.657 --> 08:54.159
Thank you.
l-l-l-lt was my daddy's.

08:54.284 --> 08:56.453
- Hold that thought.
- Yeah.

08:56.578 --> 08:59.289
Shh, shh, shh, shh, shh.
Come on. Come here.

08:59.373 --> 09:02.084
Come here. Come on.
Come on, everybody.

09:02.209 --> 09:05.003
- All right, this is it.
This is the play.
- 0kay.

09:05.128 --> 09:08.131
This is the play.
This is the play. 0kay?

09:08.257 --> 09:11.593
The quarterback. Two receivers
lined up to the left, one to the right.

09:11.677 --> 09:13.971
There's a flanker lined up to the left
behind the quarterback.

09:14.179 --> 09:17.099
- 0h, okay.
- He gives the ball...
No, he doesn't get the ball.

09:17.307 --> 09:19.726
The receiver goes
all the way over there to the left.

09:19.810 --> 09:24.606
0nce the quarterback has the ball,
he fakes to the left.

09:24.731 --> 09:28.777
No. He fakes to the right.
He doesn't fake.

09:28.902 --> 09:34.616
He thinks about faking.
He pretends to fake.

09:34.741 --> 09:37.744
I don't know
where I am.

09:37.870 --> 09:39.830
I can't breathe.

09:39.955 --> 09:43.792
0r, this room is getting smaller.
I have to sit down.

09:44.001 --> 09:46.503
Hang on here.
Take some water.

09:53.719 --> 09:55.470
All right, there.

10:01.018 --> 10:04.021
This is good. This is much better
than what I serve.

10:06.023 --> 10:11.653
- That is the water that
you serve to your players?
- Uh-huh.

10:11.737 --> 10:14.865
It is imperative that you allow me
to be your waterboy.

10:14.990 --> 10:19.661
I can't hire you.
I can't hire anybody with the...

10:19.786 --> 10:22.164
You do not have to... have to pay me.
l-I will do it for free.

10:22.289 --> 10:26.960
Just promise me that you will
never distribute the contents
of that jug to any human person.

10:27.085 --> 10:31.548
- That's a deal.
- It's a deal?

10:31.757 --> 10:36.053
Thank you so-so much, Coach Klein.
l... I will not let you down.

10:36.136 --> 10:37.513
- Good day.
- Good day.

10:37.721 --> 10:40.432
l-l-I'll see you
at practice.

10:45.938 --> 10:48.440
- - Boom, boom, boom, boom -
- [Yelling]

10:48.565 --> 10:51.068
- Bang, bang, bang, bang -

10:51.151 --> 10:54.196
- Boom, boom, boom, boom -

10:54.404 --> 10:56.907
- Bang, bang, bang, bang
Hey -

10:56.990 --> 10:58.867
- Hey...

11:03.247 --> 11:06.583
Quit hoggin' that.
Pass it over.

11:14.091 --> 11:18.053
[Mumbling,
Indistinct]

11:23.267 --> 11:25.143
0kay.

11:25.269 --> 11:28.480
Just have the defence
run sprints.

11:28.605 --> 11:30.482
[Mumbling Continues]

11:48.500 --> 11:51.628
Yo! Water's better cold.

11:51.753 --> 11:56.633
Yes, I agree, but to guarantee that
the H20 is-is purified,

11:56.758 --> 11:59.469
i-it's good to use
the heating source, Sterno.

11:59.553 --> 12:03.307
It's like my mama always says,
"Better safe than-than sorry."

12:06.560 --> 12:10.314
My mama says that too.
Aren't all mamas the same?

12:10.397 --> 12:13.859
- Yes.
- Derek. I kick
the field goals around here.

12:14.067 --> 12:18.530
Will you listen up? I need
your cooperation. I need it now.

12:18.655 --> 12:20.824
Is he gonna be-be
all right?

12:20.949 --> 12:24.578
Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah. He has
his good days and his bad days.

12:24.786 --> 12:26.872
Used to be an assistant coach
at some big football school,

12:26.997 --> 12:28.874
but he had a mental breakdown
or something.

12:29.082 --> 12:31.585
Don't worry.
He'll snap out of it.

12:31.668 --> 12:34.588
- Let me know when it
cools down, baby. All right.
- Yes.

12:34.713 --> 12:37.090
[Chuckles]

12:37.216 --> 12:39.801
[Panting]

12:39.927 --> 12:43.347
Hey, did you all get a load
of the new waterboy?

12:44.932 --> 12:47.935
Let's make him feel right at home.
Jerry, go right.

12:48.060 --> 12:51.271
Casey, go left.
Way left.

12:51.480 --> 12:53.482
- 0n one. Ready?
- [All] Break!

12:59.613 --> 13:02.866
Set! Red, 22!

13:02.950 --> 13:06.703
Red, 22! Hut!

13:10.249 --> 13:12.251
[Grunting]

13:12.334 --> 13:15.045
- [Cheering]
- [Laughing]

13:18.173 --> 13:22.886
l-l-l-I think you zigged
when you should've zagged on that play.

13:22.970 --> 13:26.849
- Sorry.
- Hey, Waterboy, check this out.

13:30.394 --> 13:33.814
[All Laughing]

13:37.276 --> 13:39.862
[Laughing Continues]

13:47.160 --> 13:49.997
Hey, Waterboy!
Check this out.

13:52.708 --> 13:55.002
- [Laughing]
- [Grunting]

13:55.085 --> 13:57.296
- Yes.
- [Grunting Continues]

13:57.504 --> 13:59.381
Well, my, my, my.

13:59.590 --> 14:03.427
Was my little aquatic engineer about
to bash one of my football players?

14:03.552 --> 14:06.138
Well, he spit
in the c-c-cooler.

14:06.263 --> 14:09.683
He happens to be
a finely tuned athletic machine.

14:09.892 --> 14:14.605
And I ain't gonna have him hit
in the head by some idiot waterboy.

14:14.813 --> 14:18.233
[Echoing]
Do you understand me?

14:18.442 --> 14:20.527
- Are you all right?
- What? I wasn't gonna
do nothin', Coach.

14:20.652 --> 14:23.655
Well, you better do something.
You gotta defend yourself here, Bobby.

14:23.780 --> 14:26.992
But they're-they're-they're
finely tuned athletic machines.

14:27.117 --> 14:30.037
I am not telling you
to go on a shooting rampage.

14:30.120 --> 14:33.457
But you have to stand up
for yourself, or they're
gonna ride you all season long.

14:33.582 --> 14:36.585
Believe me,
I've seen it myself.

14:41.715 --> 14:45.052
Hey, moron!

14:47.554 --> 14:51.391
Hey! Moron! Duh!

14:51.517 --> 14:55.062
[lmitating Bobby]
L-Look at me. I'm the w-w-waterboy.

14:55.145 --> 15:00.692
Duh! I got
a wooden spoon. Duh!

15:02.152 --> 15:04.947
Smell like you could use
a shower, stinky. [Cackling]

15:06.114 --> 15:08.825
You're fired!
[Cackling]

15:09.952 --> 15:13.080
[Both Laughing]

15:13.205 --> 15:15.499
Stop makin' fun of me.

15:16.625 --> 15:19.670
Red, ready! Hut!

15:22.798 --> 15:25.592
- Wow!
- Damn!

15:25.801 --> 15:27.469
[Mumbling]

15:30.389 --> 15:34.268
- I'm sorry.
- [Groaning]

15:34.351 --> 15:37.271
Who that?
Who there?

15:40.107 --> 15:43.861
So that's what openin' up
a can of whoop-ass feels like.

15:43.944 --> 15:47.823
Son, you just opened
a whole case of whoop-ass.

15:47.906 --> 15:51.577
I would be honoured if you
play football for this team.

15:51.660 --> 15:55.205
- Me? Play football?
- Yes.

15:55.414 --> 15:58.959
Thanks, but no thanks. My mama
won't let me play no football.

15:59.084 --> 16:02.838
We're gonna go home.
You and l, we're gonna talk to Mama.

16:03.046 --> 16:05.841
M-Mama said... M-Mama said...
My mama said... Mama said...

16:05.966 --> 16:09.595
- My mama said... My mama say that...
- She's gonna say yes.

16:13.348 --> 16:15.642
[Zapper Buzzing]

16:21.481 --> 16:24.401
Mmm, that snake
looks delicious.

16:24.526 --> 16:27.446
What part do you think
I'm about to eat?

16:27.529 --> 16:31.700
Uh, basically
a snake don't have parts.

16:31.825 --> 16:34.828
But, uh, if I had to
call it anything,

16:34.953 --> 16:37.956
I would say
it's his knee.

16:38.081 --> 16:40.792
Great. His knee.

16:42.878 --> 16:44.963
And what are we having
for dessert?

16:45.047 --> 16:48.926
[Animal Chittering
In Zapper]

16:49.009 --> 16:50.469
- Squirrel.
- [Squirrel Thuds]

16:52.262 --> 16:54.014
Excellent.

16:56.225 --> 16:58.393
Let's talk about Bobby
playing football.

16:58.602 --> 17:01.522
I don't like it, Mr Coach Klein.
I don't like it one bit.

17:01.730 --> 17:04.441
You see, my boy is too delicate
to be playin' "fool's ball"...

17:04.566 --> 17:06.527
or whatever you call it...
with them gargantuans.

17:06.734 --> 17:08.945
I don't think you understand,
Mrs Boucher.

17:09.154 --> 17:11.531
No, you don't understand me,
Mr Coach Klein.

17:11.656 --> 17:15.493
My boy is all I got left. 0w!

17:15.618 --> 17:17.788
- [Steve Braying]
- Mama, here.

17:17.913 --> 17:19.790
It's the brain pain, Coach.

17:19.873 --> 17:23.001
You see, my husband Robert,

17:23.126 --> 17:26.755
one day back in 1966,
pick up sticks,

17:26.964 --> 17:30.634
and me four months pregnant
with this precious angel.

17:30.717 --> 17:33.136
He decides he wants to go
and help the foreign peoples.

17:33.345 --> 17:35.097
He's gonna go
and join the Peace Corps.

17:35.222 --> 17:37.391
And he promise me
that everything's gonna be okay.

17:37.516 --> 17:40.310
Just like you
promisin' me now.

17:40.435 --> 17:43.146
But everything wasn't okay. No.

17:43.230 --> 17:46.775
He got lost in the middle
of the Sahara Desert.

17:46.900 --> 17:50.237
And he died.
He died!

17:50.320 --> 17:55.951
- Couldn't get no water, Coach.
He died of the dehydration.
- And we were left all alone.

17:56.076 --> 18:00.330
I would've gotten my daddy some water,
but I was just a little baby
inside Mama's stomach.

18:00.455 --> 18:03.458
And now you wanna take away
the only part of my Robert I have left.

18:03.584 --> 18:07.754
But don't you want the only part you've
got left to get a college education?

18:07.838 --> 18:12.342
- Nah.
- Me, a college student?

18:12.426 --> 18:15.345
Yes. Bobby, think about it.

18:15.470 --> 18:17.639
A whole new world
will open to you.

18:17.764 --> 18:20.767
Boy, Mama, that-that-that sounds nice.
Me-Me, a college man.

18:20.976 --> 18:22.978
Coach, my Bobby's
a sweet boy,

18:23.187 --> 18:25.772
but he ain't exactly what you'd call
"college material,"

18:25.898 --> 18:28.692
so don't you go fillin' his simple head
with all those crazy dreams...

18:28.817 --> 18:31.737
of school and college
and things of that sort.

18:31.820 --> 18:34.323
But Mama, l-I'm tired
of everybody callin' me a dummy.

18:34.448 --> 18:37.659
I'm-I'm tired
of not havin' any friends.

18:37.868 --> 18:40.996
And my ass is tired sittin' here
jawin' all night. I'm goin' to bed.

18:41.121 --> 18:45.167
Nice to meet you, Mr Coach.
Good luck with your fool's ball.

18:45.292 --> 18:48.003
Bobby, after you let Mr Coach out,
you come into my bedroom.

18:48.212 --> 18:50.506
Mama'll brush your hair.

18:53.425 --> 18:55.385
- [Door Closes]
- You know, when I was your age,

18:55.511 --> 18:59.765
my mother told me not to get a tattoo...
of Roy 0rbison.

19:05.729 --> 19:10.192
But what Mama don't know
won't hurt her.

19:13.445 --> 19:15.822
I trust you'll make
the right decision.

19:20.536 --> 19:22.496
- 0h, yeah -

19:24.081 --> 19:26.041
- Huh
I'm -

19:26.166 --> 19:29.294
- Gonna get under your skin -

19:29.378 --> 19:32.506
- - Sooner or later -
- Damn, I don't want that ass
on the team.

19:32.631 --> 19:34.508
Everybody's gonna
laugh at us.

19:34.591 --> 19:36.593
Everybody's already
laughin' at us.

19:36.677 --> 19:39.388
We ain't won a game
since 1994.

19:39.596 --> 19:44.101
- - Sooner or later...
- Hey! What's up, baby?
- Hey.

19:44.309 --> 19:48.272
- Where's your helmet?
- Derek Wallace, they-they
don't got no more helmets.

19:48.480 --> 19:51.275
Here. You can share mine.

19:51.400 --> 19:53.777
Try it on, man.
See if it fits.

19:57.030 --> 19:59.741
- All right.
- Thanks, friend.

19:59.825 --> 20:03.161
- What a dink.
- [Whistle Blowing]

20:03.287 --> 20:05.581
Come on!
Huddle up!

20:05.664 --> 20:08.792
- [Mumbling]
- [Coach Klein] All right,
we have an announcement to make.

20:08.917 --> 20:12.963
0ur former waterboy, Bobby Boucher,
is gonna play some linebacker for us.

20:13.088 --> 20:18.719
[lmitating Bobby]
0oh, I'm a f-f-football player.
[Grunting]

20:18.802 --> 20:22.472
- Coach, I'd like to tackle him
right now, please.
- Not yet.

20:22.681 --> 20:26.101
All right, now I wanna work with the
offence. I wanna work with the defence.

20:26.226 --> 20:29.146
- Special teams, go with
Farmer Fran, do some laps.
- Shit.

20:29.354 --> 20:31.648
[Farmer Fran Mumbling]

20:34.776 --> 20:37.487
Line up on the ball.

20:39.156 --> 20:41.950
- [Man] Let's go.
- All right? Third and ten.

20:42.075 --> 20:44.161
Third and ten?

20:46.246 --> 20:50.000
Yeah, you know, that's
the offense's last opportunity...

20:50.083 --> 20:51.960
to gain ten yards
before they have to punt.

20:52.085 --> 20:53.962
Gee, he's gonna run
the option.

20:54.171 --> 20:55.923
0ption?

20:56.131 --> 20:58.842
- [Grumbling]
- He ain't never gonna be able
to figure this out, Coach.

20:58.967 --> 21:01.887
Yes, he is.

21:01.970 --> 21:05.641
Now, Bobby, you've waterboyed
for 18 years.

21:05.724 --> 21:07.601
Didn't you occasionally
watch the game?

21:07.809 --> 21:10.646
0h, I had a lot
to k-keep me busy.

21:10.729 --> 21:14.399
- Checking the pH levels,
refillin' the cups.
- All right.

21:14.483 --> 21:16.568
Well, then let's just
keep it simple.

21:16.693 --> 21:19.905
Casey. I want you
to tackle Casey...

21:20.030 --> 21:22.533
like you did Gee yesterday.

21:22.741 --> 21:25.536
- Right now?
- Right now! Go!

21:25.661 --> 21:28.580
- Does he know about this?
- Doesn't matter. You're a warrior.

21:28.664 --> 21:30.541
Go.

21:36.296 --> 21:38.382
- [Man] Boy, what you doin'?
- [Players Grumbling]

21:39.842 --> 21:42.845
[Coach Klein]
All right. Bobby, Bobby.

21:42.970 --> 21:45.347
Don't be afraid to use
all of your strength, you know?

21:45.472 --> 21:47.766
He's resilient.
He's a resilient guy.

21:47.850 --> 21:49.726
0kay? Come on.

21:49.852 --> 21:53.188
[Man] Hey, Casey,
I think he wanna make out with you.

21:53.397 --> 21:55.148
- [Whistle Blowing]
- 0kay, that's enough. Thank you.

21:55.357 --> 21:59.528
Is there any sport that you
do watch? You know, a physical sport?

21:59.653 --> 22:01.822
- Boxing? Hockey?
- Wrestling.

22:01.947 --> 22:04.116
Wrestling! Wrestling is good.

22:04.241 --> 22:06.201
Who's your favourite wrestler?

22:06.326 --> 22:09.538
Well, even though he was slightly
discourteous to me recently,

22:09.663 --> 22:11.748
I'm gonna have to say
Captain Insano.

22:11.832 --> 22:15.377
0kay, okay,
I want you to do to Casey...

22:15.586 --> 22:19.882
what Captain Insano does
to the bad guy.

22:19.965 --> 22:21.842
Go.

22:26.555 --> 22:28.432
- 0w! 0w!
- [Players Gasping]

22:30.309 --> 22:33.729
- He poked me in the eye.
- Captain Insano shows no mercy.

22:35.314 --> 22:38.859
Bobby, where was the intensity
that I saw yesterday?

22:38.942 --> 22:41.653
That was no intensity. You said it
was all right to fight back,

22:41.778 --> 22:45.824
and l-I just started thinkin'
about all the people who-who'd
been mean to me over the years.

22:46.992 --> 22:49.578
That's it.
That's it.

22:49.786 --> 22:51.997
I want you to think about
all those mean people.

22:52.206 --> 22:56.793
- They're gonna be your tackling fuel.
- Tacklin' fuel.

22:57.002 --> 23:00.839
- We're gonna use them to play football.
- Tacklin' fuel.

23:00.964 --> 23:05.010
I want you to pretend
that Casey...

23:05.135 --> 23:07.513
- Is insulting you.
- Pretend?

23:07.638 --> 23:11.683
I want you to visualize all those
people that have been mean to you.

23:11.808 --> 23:14.603
And then I want you to attack. I want
you to visualize and then attack.

23:14.728 --> 23:17.314
- Can you handle that?
- I'll try.

23:17.439 --> 23:19.316
He's gonna try.

23:28.992 --> 23:31.912
What's the matter with you, boy?
You too s-s-stupid...

23:32.037 --> 23:33.914
to do what your coach
tells ya?

23:33.997 --> 23:37.334
- [Coach Laughing]
- No!

23:37.459 --> 23:40.254
- No what?
- [Yelling]

23:43.090 --> 23:44.967
[Players Murmuring]

23:45.175 --> 23:48.929
I didn't mean to hurt you.
Coach told me to pretend.

23:49.012 --> 23:54.226
Bobby. Bobby! Can you do this for
me every single game? Can you do this?

23:54.351 --> 23:56.520
Coach, not only
will I do it for you.

23:56.728 --> 24:00.482
l-l-l...
Yes, yes, I'll do it for ya.

24:00.607 --> 24:03.944
[Chattering]

24:05.487 --> 24:08.615
So, uh, why you pick this class anyway?
It's pretty hard.

24:08.740 --> 24:10.909
0h, beautiful view.

24:12.911 --> 24:14.663
Correct.

24:14.872 --> 24:18.000
All right, all right!

24:18.125 --> 24:20.002
Y'all shut up now!

24:20.210 --> 24:24.381
Now, last week,
we talked about...

24:24.590 --> 24:26.675
the physiology
of the animal brain...

24:26.758 --> 24:29.678
as it pertains
to aggression.

24:29.803 --> 24:33.348
Now, is there anyone here
that can tell me why...

24:33.557 --> 24:36.560
most alligators
are abnormally aggressive?

24:36.685 --> 24:39.813
- I know the answer to this question.
- Raise your hand.

24:39.897 --> 24:43.859
Anybody? Anyone?
Yes, sir. You, sir.

24:46.695 --> 24:48.989
Mama says that alligators
are ornery...

24:49.072 --> 24:51.909
'cause they got all them teeth
but no toothbrush.

24:54.203 --> 24:57.206
[Chuckling]
Yo mama said,

24:57.331 --> 25:00.959
alligators are ornery
'cause they got all them teeth...

25:01.084 --> 25:03.170
and no toothbrush.

25:03.253 --> 25:05.130
Wow!

25:05.255 --> 25:08.258
Anybody else?
Yes, sir. You, sir.

25:08.383 --> 25:11.929
Alligators are aggressive because
of an enlarged medulla oblongata.

25:12.012 --> 25:13.889
It's the sector of the brain
which controls aggressive behaviour.

25:14.097 --> 25:18.060
- That is correct!
The medulla oblongata.
- But Mama said...

25:18.268 --> 25:21.104
The medulla oblongata...

25:22.439 --> 25:27.236
is where anger, jealousy
and aggression come from.

25:27.361 --> 25:32.241
Now, is there anybody here can tell
me where happiness comes from?

25:32.366 --> 25:35.369
- No, man.
- Anyone?

25:37.246 --> 25:41.834
All right, let's hear what
Mama has to say on the subject.

25:41.959 --> 25:47.673
Mama say that happiness is
from magic rays of sunshine that
come down when you feelin' blue.

25:49.883 --> 25:54.054
Well, folks,
Mama's wrong again.

25:55.389 --> 25:57.266
No, Colonel Sanders,
you're wrong.

25:57.391 --> 25:58.934
- [Students] 0oh!
- Mama's right.

25:59.142 --> 26:03.939
You're all wrong.
Mama's right. Mama's right!

26:04.064 --> 26:06.358
Somethin' wrong
with his medulla oblongata.

26:06.441 --> 26:09.486
- [Class Laughing]
- [Yelling]

26:13.657 --> 26:16.785
It's okay to fight back.
Coach Klein said I could.

26:16.994 --> 26:19.162
Mr Coach Klein said I could.
It's fine, fellas.

26:21.582 --> 26:23.750
[Announcer] Well, Mud Dog
fans, it's time to kick off...

26:23.876 --> 26:25.752
another year
of Mud Dog football.

26:25.836 --> 26:29.798
With the weight of a 40-game
losing streak on their back,

26:29.923 --> 26:33.343
everyone seems to be diggin' in
for the long haul.

26:35.137 --> 26:38.140
- There's blood in the streets
It's up to my ankles -

26:39.725 --> 26:42.311
- There's blood in the streets
It's up to my knee -

26:43.896 --> 26:47.024
- Blood on the streets
in the town of Chicago -

26:47.232 --> 26:51.403
- Blood on the rise
It's following me...

26:51.486 --> 26:53.363
What you doin', Bobby?

26:53.488 --> 26:57.117
0h, Lord, that-that-that's some
heavy-duty armpit saturation.

26:57.242 --> 27:00.162
That's an early warning sign of
the dehydration. You gots to have H20.

27:00.245 --> 27:01.914
- Please, for me.
- Look, you need to stop
worryin' about water, baby,

27:02.039 --> 27:04.333
and start worryin'
about the game today, okay?

27:04.416 --> 27:09.213
Here. Now, just do whatever you did
to Colonel Sanders,

27:09.338 --> 27:11.215
and you'll be fine.

27:11.423 --> 27:15.594
l-I will, thank you. L-l-I just...
I feel bad about lyin' to my mama.

27:15.677 --> 27:17.679
I wonder what
she's doin' right now.

27:17.888 --> 27:20.182
...[Country]

27:20.390 --> 27:22.684
[Braying]

27:22.768 --> 27:26.522
- [Grunting]
- [Announcer] And he's down
with a three-yard kickoff return.

27:26.647 --> 27:29.024
- The Mud Dogs offence takes the field.
- 0kay, come on, here we go.

27:29.149 --> 27:32.486
Come on, everybody.
You can do it. Gain some yards.
Put some points on the board.

27:32.569 --> 27:34.780
Hey, Walter,
I'll bet you 50 bucks...

27:34.863 --> 27:37.366
Gee Grenouille throws a touchdown pass
on the first play.

27:37.574 --> 27:39.451
Check it out.

27:39.576 --> 27:41.745
Set, fool, 22, hut!

27:41.870 --> 27:43.747
[Shouting]

27:46.250 --> 27:48.544
[Man Laughing]

27:50.420 --> 27:52.297
You owe me 50 bucks.

27:52.381 --> 27:56.760
- You said it was gonna be
a touchdown pass, you crazy asshole.
- Go, go, go, go!

27:56.885 --> 28:00.305
Hold 'em, hold 'em, hold 'em.
0kay, you can do it. Come on.

28:00.430 --> 28:02.808
Bobby, Bobby, this is
just like we practised, okay?

28:02.933 --> 28:04.810
0kay, go, go, go.
Come on.

28:07.604 --> 28:11.900
Watch where you're going, needle dick.

[Whistle Blowing]

28:14.194 --> 28:16.572
[Shouting]

28:19.074 --> 28:21.910
Set! 390!

28:22.119 --> 28:27.332
- Time for retard to find out what
college football's all about.
- [Laughing]

28:27.416 --> 28:31.920
390! Check, check.

28:32.129 --> 28:35.883
Red, 18! Red, 18!

28:35.966 --> 28:39.428
Needle dick! Needle dick!
Needle dick!

28:39.636 --> 28:42.556
[Bobby Grunting]

28:42.639 --> 28:45.267
Yeah!

28:45.475 --> 28:47.769
Your name is needle dick.

28:47.853 --> 28:51.398
- [Grunting]
- I knew that this was a good idea.

28:53.483 --> 28:55.777
[Bobby Grunting]

29:03.827 --> 29:04.953
Yes!

29:07.873 --> 29:11.418
- Time-out from the game.
- What's he calling time-out for?

29:11.543 --> 29:15.172
- Man, what are you doin'?
- Here, this is for you.

29:15.297 --> 29:17.174
Enjoy.

29:17.257 --> 29:20.802
- [Coach Beaulieu]
Hey, Waterboy, you're fired!
- Stop it!

29:28.310 --> 29:30.187
Yes! Bobby!

29:32.064 --> 29:33.941
[Cheering]

29:34.066 --> 29:38.028
- 0oh-la-la. Yeah, man! Yeah!
- Yeah, yeah!

29:38.111 --> 29:41.031
- Slap hands!
- Whatever.

29:45.118 --> 29:47.621
Waterboy's killin' 'em.

29:47.704 --> 29:51.166
He's the best tackler
I've seen since Joe Montana.

29:51.250 --> 29:54.294
Joe Montana was a quarterback,
you idiot.

29:54.378 --> 29:56.463
I said, "Joe Mantegna."

29:56.588 --> 30:01.385
[Announcer]
We're tied at seven with
30 seconds to go in the fourth quarter.

30:01.468 --> 30:05.013
Eagle cover two.
Eagle cover two. Ready?

30:07.224 --> 30:09.726
Best of luck to you
on-on-on the upcoming play.

30:09.810 --> 30:14.731
- I'll be playin' with your mama tonight.
- Sixty-two.

30:14.940 --> 30:18.360
- Move, 22, hut!
- [Announcer] Bernard drops back.

30:18.485 --> 30:21.697
- Looks like a screen pass.
- [Cheering]

30:21.822 --> 30:25.367
Sixty-two! Sixty-two!
There you are!

30:25.576 --> 30:27.327
- [Groaning]
- Thank you.

30:27.536 --> 30:30.372
[Announcer]
Number 62 is headed for the end zone.

30:30.581 --> 30:34.001
He's at the 40, the 30.
He's almost...

30:34.126 --> 30:37.129
Man! Touchdown!
Reds lead.

30:37.254 --> 30:39.423
[Bobby Grunting]

30:39.548 --> 30:41.925
Dropkick. Looks like Boucher
knocked him out cold.

30:42.050 --> 30:46.513
I love my mama very much.
Now you know that.

30:46.638 --> 30:49.558
- [Crying]
- [Crowd Moaning]

30:49.641 --> 30:53.937
The waterboy handed them the game.
What an idiot.

30:54.021 --> 30:56.023
Waterboy, you stink!

30:58.108 --> 31:01.945
Nice job, shithead.
You just lost us the game.

31:02.070 --> 31:06.033
I'm sorry. Would you please
still be my friend?

31:06.116 --> 31:08.827
No! Get away from me.

31:08.952 --> 31:11.330
0kay.

31:16.335 --> 31:18.212
Excuse me?
May I help you?

31:19.671 --> 31:21.548
Hey, stud.

31:21.673 --> 31:25.511
Vicki Vallencourt, this is...
this is quite a pleasant surprise.

31:25.636 --> 31:29.806
Yeah, well, I just got out of jail,
and I heard you were playin' football.

31:29.890 --> 31:33.852
Yes, well, l-l-I've...

31:33.977 --> 31:38.148
[Mumbling, Indistinct]

31:38.232 --> 31:39.608
[Bobby]
Yes.

31:39.816 --> 31:42.110
[Mumbling, Indistinct]

31:44.821 --> 31:47.616
So, let's say we go and get
somethin' to eat, catch up on things.

31:47.741 --> 31:49.701
0h, uh...

31:49.826 --> 31:52.955
Mama's not a-a-a big fan
of restaurants...

31:53.038 --> 31:55.123
or of-of me going to one.

31:57.417 --> 31:59.920
But if-if you'd like,
sometimes,

32:00.128 --> 32:03.257
Mama, she, uh... she like to...
on a Sunday afternoon...

32:03.382 --> 32:08.053
There-There's a-a-a grill
with the charcoal b-biscuits.

32:08.178 --> 32:10.556
- You want me to come to a barbecue?
- Yes, that's it.

32:10.681 --> 32:13.392
[Chuckling]
Sounds great.

32:14.935 --> 32:18.814
And by the way, I hope you like
what I did to y'all lawn mower.

32:24.444 --> 32:26.321
[Steve Braying]

32:29.658 --> 32:32.452
You know that old hag that does
astrology on Good Morning America,

32:32.578 --> 32:34.454
she really ought
to pack it in.

32:34.538 --> 32:37.666
Listen what she said
for Sagittarius. She goes:

32:37.791 --> 32:40.377
"You're gonna be faced with
a difficult decision today."

32:40.502 --> 32:43.839
But the thing is-is-is, we're all faced
with difficult decisions every day.

32:44.047 --> 32:46.008
- That's like sayin'
you're gonna eat today.
- Yeah, m-maybe...

32:46.216 --> 32:49.469
by leaving her predictions
vague and generalized,

32:49.553 --> 32:52.389
there's less of a chance of someone
findin' out she's a phoney.

32:52.598 --> 32:54.975
Whatever, college boy.

32:55.100 --> 32:58.520
- Don't say college boy. Here comes Mama.
- 0h, okay.

33:01.565 --> 33:04.067
That looks nice, Mama.

33:04.276 --> 33:06.028
[Sighing]

33:06.236 --> 33:09.156
- Mmm, here you go, Vicki Vallencourt.
- Thank you.

33:09.364 --> 33:12.409
Mama, Vicki's
an astrologist.

33:12.492 --> 33:14.703
I don't believe in that sort
of thing, personally.

33:14.912 --> 33:17.080
Astronomy is one
of the many tools of the devil.

33:20.834 --> 33:23.754
You sure played great
yesterday, Bobby.

33:23.879 --> 33:27.716
- What did my boy play great?
- Uh, um...

33:27.841 --> 33:32.221
Waterboy. Yeah, waterboy.
He played... He played waterboy great.

33:32.429 --> 33:35.766
Everybody who was thirsty
got a drink right away...

33:35.849 --> 33:38.477
yesterday at the...
at the football game.

33:38.560 --> 33:42.105
Fool's ball! Bunch of overgrown
monsters manhandling each other.

33:42.314 --> 33:44.733
Remember when that man wanted you
to play fool's ball, Bobby?

33:44.942 --> 33:48.779
Yeah, l... He...
Roy 0rbison...

33:48.904 --> 33:51.615
Coach Klein.
l-l-I remember.

33:51.698 --> 33:53.700
So, Bobby, did they ever catch
that gorilla...

33:53.784 --> 33:56.286
what escaped from the zoo
and punched you in the eye?

33:56.411 --> 34:00.791
No, Mama, he...
The-The search continues.

34:04.002 --> 34:08.590
What would you think if Bobby
did play football, Mrs Boucher?

34:08.715 --> 34:11.301
Well, I wouldn't
think much of it at all.

34:11.510 --> 34:14.137
And to tell you the truth,
I don't think much of you...

34:14.221 --> 34:17.474
and all your snotty questions,
Miss Vallencourt.

34:17.558 --> 34:20.686
I'm quite disturbed to see
that you're so interested in my boy.

34:20.811 --> 34:24.982
I'm very, very interested
in your boy, Mrs Boucher.

34:25.065 --> 34:26.650
- Really?
- Mm.

34:26.859 --> 34:29.152
Well, did he tell you
about how much his feet smell?

34:29.360 --> 34:31.947
- Mama.
- He has to wear two pair of socks.

34:32.072 --> 34:35.199
Well, men are supposed
to have stinky feet.

34:35.284 --> 34:37.286
Well, are men
supposed to wear pyjamas...

34:37.494 --> 34:40.080
featuring a cartoon character
by the name of Deputy Dog?

34:40.205 --> 34:43.000
- Mama, please.
- Well, you know what?

34:43.125 --> 34:45.502
I happen to find
Deputy Dog to be...

34:45.627 --> 34:49.797
very, very sexy.

34:49.882 --> 34:52.592
Did he tell you about
a little bedtime problem?

34:52.717 --> 34:56.679
- Mama, I'm beggin' you, don't.
- That's his sheet back there.

34:58.015 --> 35:01.351
If you'll excuse me, ladies,
I'm gonna go hang myself.

35:01.476 --> 35:04.271
- Now you see what you done?
- What I did?

35:04.396 --> 35:07.608
Now you listen here, cupcake. The
"onliest" woman in my boy's life is me.

35:07.733 --> 35:11.904
Nobody's gonna take him away, especially
not some godless Jezebel like you.

35:11.987 --> 35:14.198
0h, yeah, well your Bobby
is a grown man.

35:14.281 --> 35:17.951
And guess what? He can hang out
with whoever he wants!

35:18.035 --> 35:20.454
0h, yes, he can.
Whoever he wants. 'Cept you!

35:20.537 --> 35:24.082
Bobby, that-that woman
is the devil.

35:24.208 --> 35:26.376
- I want you to stay away
from her, you hear me?
- Yes, Mama.

35:26.502 --> 35:29.838
Now you come on inside before that
little ol' witch casts a spell on us!

35:33.800 --> 35:36.386
I'm sorry,
Vicki Vallencourt.

35:41.183 --> 35:43.060
Whatever.

35:43.185 --> 35:46.939
- If you want it, you got it
You feed it, you love it -

35:47.022 --> 35:50.359
- Say that you need it
You never......

35:52.653 --> 35:56.532
When we report on the S.C.L.S.U.
Mud Dogs here on Sportscenter,
it's usually to add...

35:56.740 --> 36:00.369
another number to their amazing
losing streak, which now stands at 41.

36:00.494 --> 36:03.914
But now, Bobby Boucher
has given us another reason.

36:04.039 --> 36:05.916
In the Mud Dog's latest loss
this past Saturday,

36:06.124 --> 36:09.044
the amazing 31-year-old freshman
set a new N.C.A.A. record...

36:09.127 --> 36:11.630
by sacking the quarterback
16 times,

36:11.755 --> 36:13.924
shattering the old record
of seven.

36:14.132 --> 36:17.386
And, oh, by the way, Bobby Boucher
is also the team's waterboy,

36:17.469 --> 36:19.680
which, of course,
begs the question:

36:19.763 --> 36:21.849
What exactly are they putting
in the water...

36:21.974 --> 36:24.893
down in Jackson's Bayou,
Louisiana?

36:24.977 --> 36:29.898
- There is a house
in New 0rleans -

36:31.650 --> 36:35.612
- They call The Rising Sun...

36:35.821 --> 36:38.949
[Announcer] We're deadlocked
at three with less than a minute to go.

36:39.074 --> 36:41.577
[Coach Klein]
We are one family with one dream.

36:41.660 --> 36:43.537
There are 40 of you
on this team, not just one.

36:43.745 --> 36:47.416
Bobby can't do this by himself. Now get
out there and make something happen!

36:47.499 --> 36:49.918
- All right, sacrifice
your bodies. Go, go, go!
- [Players Cheering]

36:50.002 --> 36:54.298
Thank you. Bobby, you're gonna
have to do this by yourself...

36:54.381 --> 36:56.675
because there is nobody
on this team that's any good.

36:56.800 --> 36:59.595
Now look, I can't stand
losing any more.

36:59.720 --> 37:02.639
We've got to win one game. Can you
go out there and make something happen?

37:02.723 --> 37:04.391
- Visualize and attack.
- Yeah.

37:04.516 --> 37:06.059
- Visualize and attack. Please!
- Yes. Yes, yes, yes, yes.

37:06.185 --> 37:08.896
- Please!
- [Mumbling, Indistinct]

37:08.979 --> 37:12.316
[Announcer] Central Kentucky's down
to their third straight quarterback.

37:12.441 --> 37:14.818
Good news, folks.
First-string quarterback, Tommy Gardner,

37:14.943 --> 37:16.904
does not have a broken neck.

37:17.029 --> 37:20.657
Blue, 52!
Blue, 52! Hut!

37:20.782 --> 37:23.785
I forbid you to talk to
that enchantress. She's the devil!

37:23.911 --> 37:27.748
She's not the devil. She's the
most beautiful woman in the world.

37:27.873 --> 37:31.502
- I never said she was the devil.
- She's the most beautiful woman
in the world.

37:31.627 --> 37:33.587
0h, please, don't hurt me!

37:35.672 --> 37:38.592
Follow the...
Come on!

37:38.800 --> 37:40.677
You crazy man!
0kay, okay, okay!

37:40.802 --> 37:44.431
It's a safety!
They win, they win, they win!

37:44.556 --> 37:47.684
With the help of Boucher,
the losing streak is over!

37:47.893 --> 37:51.021
I'm so sorry, Mama.
Please, forgive me.

37:51.230 --> 37:54.233
I love you so much, Mama.
I love you.

37:54.358 --> 37:56.860
- I love you too.
- [Derek] We won!

37:57.069 --> 38:00.697
We won, baby! It's gonna be a big
party tonight, and you're going!

38:00.822 --> 38:04.159
- Me? Party?
- Yeah, baby!

38:04.243 --> 38:06.537
[Cheering]

38:06.662 --> 38:09.581
[Chanting]
Party! Party!

38:09.665 --> 38:13.001
- Let's groove tonight -

38:13.126 --> 38:17.172
- And share
the spots and light -

38:19.591 --> 38:22.177
Hey! Nice suit.

38:22.302 --> 38:24.680
Thank you.
It was my daddy's.

38:24.805 --> 38:30.227
Mama don't know I'm here,
but I took these outta the icebox:
Louisiana frog cakes.

38:30.310 --> 38:32.396
Thanks.

38:32.521 --> 38:36.149
- Come on in.
- [Woman] Hey, Bobby Boucher!

38:36.275 --> 38:38.986
Look who's here:
Sergeant Stutter.

38:39.069 --> 38:42.739
- Want a beer?
- I'll take a Scotch and water.
Hold the Scotch.

38:42.948 --> 38:46.285
- You just make a joke, Bobby?
- Yes, I did.

38:46.368 --> 38:49.413
[Chuckling]
Good one.

38:49.496 --> 38:53.667
Now that you finally won a game, right,
you feel looser, the pressure is off,

38:53.792 --> 38:56.503
and that will lead
to a lot more victories.

38:56.587 --> 39:00.966
- Yeah, that and a waterboy
getting 20 sacks a game.
- That too.

39:02.968 --> 39:05.137
- Professor!
- [Gasping]

39:05.262 --> 39:08.056
We still havin' that test on amphibians
and reptiles next Friday?

39:08.182 --> 39:13.061
Yes, sir. That is,
if it's all right with you.

39:13.187 --> 39:17.983
- 0f course, it is.
- My best regards to your dear mama.

39:18.066 --> 39:20.903
[Woman]
Let's talk to the waterboy.

39:20.986 --> 39:23.071
You played amazing
at the game today, Bobby.

39:23.280 --> 39:27.242
And you are so cute.
Is there a girl you're seein'?

39:27.367 --> 39:32.247
Seein'? Uh, uh, I see
a lot of girls.

39:32.456 --> 39:34.666
I see a lot of guys too.

39:34.750 --> 39:37.252
I think that's sexy.

39:37.377 --> 39:39.755
You ever been with a guy and a girl
at the same time?

39:39.963 --> 39:41.840
0h, yeah, plenty of times.

39:41.965 --> 39:45.385
The other night, I was with my mama
and Coach Klein at the same time.

39:47.262 --> 39:51.141
You are a bad boy.
I wish you were my boyfriend.

39:51.225 --> 39:55.729
0h, thank you, but, see, there's
this girl, Vicki Vallencourt.

39:55.812 --> 39:57.898
She may be the devil.
Mama said that.

39:58.023 --> 40:01.026
Consequently, I am prohibited
from contact with her.

40:01.151 --> 40:05.405
But I hope to get past that
one day 'cause she's nice to talk to.

40:05.614 --> 40:10.118
[Mumbling, Indistinct]

40:13.038 --> 40:14.915
0h, oh.

40:22.840 --> 40:25.133
...[Rap]

40:27.845 --> 40:30.764
- Take me and break me off
Baby, let me play the clothes
and I'll take me off -

40:30.848 --> 40:32.933
- 'Cause I've been checkin' out
your style from across the stand -

40:33.058 --> 40:35.352
- And I'm much more than your waterboy
and average fan -

40:35.435 --> 40:37.855
- You ask me why
Perfect practise makes perfect game -

40:37.938 --> 40:41.066
...[Rap Continues]

40:45.779 --> 40:48.991
- Sit-ups and pull-ups
92 octane, premium, fill up -

40:49.116 --> 40:51.285
- I'm doin' my thing
for much more than the thing -

40:51.410 --> 40:52.953
- I'm doin' my thing
for much more than the thing -

40:53.078 --> 40:55.664
- I'm doin' my thing
for much more than the thing -

40:56.415 --> 40:57.666
- I'm doin' my thing
for much more than the thing -

40:57.875 --> 40:59.543
- I'm doin' my thing for
much more than the thing...

40:59.626 --> 41:01.837
Yo, we have a very special
guest here today.

41:01.920 --> 41:06.717
Let's have a warm L.T. welcome
for Bobby Boucher. Come on, Bobby.

41:06.842 --> 41:09.011
- [Cheering]
- Thank you, Mr Lawrence Taylor.

41:09.219 --> 41:12.890
Tell me, what is your secret?
How do you find yourself
in the right position all the time?

41:12.973 --> 41:14.850
That-That-That's
a good question.

41:14.975 --> 41:18.937
What-What happens is, the-the-the
centre has-has the ball first.

41:19.021 --> 41:21.023
And-And-And the quarterback
will say, "Hike."

41:21.231 --> 41:25.068
That's when the c-center puts the ball
in-into the hands of the quarterback.

41:25.194 --> 41:28.197
So what I do is,
l-I start tacklin' the quarterback,

41:28.405 --> 41:30.699
unless he give the ball
to-to s-somebody else,

41:30.824 --> 41:34.036
in which case,
l-I try to tackle that person.

41:35.829 --> 41:39.666
Hmm? Gentleman, which brings me
to my next point:

41:39.791 --> 41:41.752
Don't smoke crack.

41:44.254 --> 41:46.048
- [Chattering]
- [Horn Honking]

41:51.553 --> 41:55.933
Vicki Vallencourt.
What you doin' here?

41:56.058 --> 41:58.769
0h, nothin'.
I was just thinkin'...

41:58.852 --> 42:02.397
about stealin' L.T. 's Porsche
over there.

42:02.523 --> 42:06.777
But I suppose I ought to
be movin' on before I get you
in trouble with your mama.

42:06.902 --> 42:11.782
Well, Mr Coach Klein said that
what Mama don't know won't hurt her.

42:11.907 --> 42:16.578
So maybe we could
ride home together.

42:16.787 --> 42:20.541
- Really?
- If you'd like to.

42:20.666 --> 42:23.252
[Giggling]
0kay.

42:23.377 --> 42:26.588
[Man]
- Who got the hooch...

42:28.465 --> 42:33.178
- Who got the hooch
Baby -

42:33.262 --> 42:38.267
- Who got the only
sweetest thing in the world -

42:38.392 --> 42:43.605
- - Who got the hooch, baby -
- [Snoring]

42:43.689 --> 42:48.610
- Who got the only
sweetest thing in the world -

42:48.819 --> 42:53.615
- Who got the love
Who got the freshy freshy -

42:53.699 --> 42:56.201
- Who got the only
sweetest thing -

42:56.326 --> 42:59.329
- - In the world...
- [Braying]

43:02.791 --> 43:04.668
You can sit down,
if you'd like.

43:04.751 --> 43:07.379
[Braying Continues]

43:07.462 --> 43:10.090
Vicki Vallencourt,
I figured...

43:10.174 --> 43:14.052
'cause you're interested in astrology
and mystical stuff like that,

43:14.136 --> 43:16.555
you might appreciate this.

43:18.432 --> 43:21.643
That's water
from a glacier in Alaska.

43:21.852 --> 43:26.356
It-lt was blessed
by a-an Eskimo medicine man.

43:26.440 --> 43:32.196
- It's cold!
- Yes, it's always cold.
That's why it's so special.

43:47.920 --> 43:50.964
That-That was...
That-That-That-That happened...

43:51.048 --> 43:55.344
That-That happened to be
my-my first time with-with lips...

43:55.427 --> 43:59.389
and-and-and-and-and
and-and-and-and-and the-the tongue.

43:59.515 --> 44:03.143
That was your tongue.
l... I believe it was...

44:03.268 --> 44:05.437
I never did that before.

44:05.562 --> 44:07.439
Well, if that was
your first kiss,

44:07.523 --> 44:11.485
then I bet it's the first time
you've seen a pair of these.

44:13.904 --> 44:17.658
Yes, yes, that is
a-another first for me,

44:17.741 --> 44:21.912
and l-I appreciate what-what-what
you're showin' me right now.

44:22.037 --> 44:24.748
[Snoring Continues]

44:24.957 --> 44:28.085
Vicki-Vicki Vallencourt,
l-I think Mama's up.

44:30.379 --> 44:33.715
[Mumbling]
Devil, devil, devil.

44:33.799 --> 44:36.510
You better get goin'.

44:38.303 --> 44:42.558
My God, Bobby, I mean, sometimes,
I just don't know why I bother with you.

44:42.766 --> 44:45.060
You ain't even a man.

44:48.522 --> 44:52.150
[Announcer] It looks like
the Cinderella S.C.L.S.U. Mud Dogs,

44:52.276 --> 44:54.444
led by linebacker
Bobby Boucher,

44:54.653 --> 44:58.323
are gonna fall one victory short
of that Bourbon Bowl bid.

44:58.407 --> 45:01.660
Iowa could win the game
by nailing this 20-yard field goal.

45:01.743 --> 45:04.454
Yeah, but the Mud Dogs have played
a sensational football game.

45:04.580 --> 45:09.042
Let's take a look at the way Boucher
entered the Hawkeyes' last drive.

45:09.168 --> 45:12.588
Here we see Boucher
instantly penetratin' the pocket.

45:12.713 --> 45:14.798
[Grunting]

45:15.007 --> 45:18.427
There's a lot of pain
and shame in those eyes.

45:18.552 --> 45:20.220
Friends, it's all over.

45:20.304 --> 45:23.849
- [Man] My leg!
- Wow, that is a disturbing image.

45:23.974 --> 45:26.351
Difficult to watch, Chris.
[Exhales]

45:26.476 --> 45:29.188
Whoo! My God!

45:29.396 --> 45:33.650
Gonna kick some names
and take some ass!

45:33.775 --> 45:36.153
Bobby!

45:36.278 --> 45:39.615
Water sucks.
Gatorade is better.

45:39.698 --> 45:42.534
- What?
- Use it on the field.

45:42.618 --> 45:45.329
[Crowd Chanting]
Waterboy, Waterboy, Waterboy!

45:52.961 --> 45:57.633
Gatorade not only quenches your thirst
better, it tastes better, too, idiot.

45:57.758 --> 46:00.761
You're-You're-You're drinkin'
the wrong water.

46:00.886 --> 46:04.848
- Gatorade.
- H20.

46:04.932 --> 46:09.311
- Gatorade!
- H20!

46:09.436 --> 46:13.815
- Water sucks, It really, really sucks
Water sucks -

46:14.024 --> 46:17.361
- - It really, really sucks...
- Stop saying that. You don't
mean that. You're bad people.

46:24.743 --> 46:27.996
[Bobby Whimpering]

46:36.129 --> 46:38.715
- [Cheering]
- [Announcer] And my friend, Chris,

46:38.841 --> 46:41.844
the Mud Dogs are goin'
to the Bourbon Bowl.

46:44.263 --> 46:47.266
With yesterday's come-from-behind
victory, the S.C.L.S.U. Mud Dogs...

46:47.391 --> 46:50.185
earned a New Year's Day date with Red
Beaulieu and the Louisiana Cougars...

46:50.310 --> 46:52.271
in the first annual
Bourbon Bowl.

46:52.396 --> 46:55.732
But not only has the waterboy
changed S.C.L.S.U. 's fortunes,

46:55.816 --> 46:58.235
he's got other teams looking
around the sidelines for talent.

46:58.443 --> 47:01.780
In fact, yesterday, Michigan,
devastated by injury,

47:01.864 --> 47:04.366
experimented with their towel boy
at wide receiver.

47:04.575 --> 47:09.371
- [Groaning]
- But the towel boy ran into
a laundry list of problems.

47:10.122 --> 47:13.333
[Cheering]

47:31.268 --> 47:34.313
You know, when I see
so many of you here tonight,

47:34.396 --> 47:39.610
it reminds me just about how special
this season really was.

47:39.735 --> 47:41.904
Not just for the team.

47:42.029 --> 47:44.406
Not just for the students.

47:44.531 --> 47:47.326
But for each and every
one of you...

47:47.451 --> 47:51.205
in our small corner
of Louisiana!

47:51.288 --> 47:55.167
- [Cheering]
- You can do it!

47:55.250 --> 47:59.421
0h, yes, we can,
and, yes, we will.

47:59.546 --> 48:01.298
Because we've got...

48:01.423 --> 48:05.802
a young man who has been
so vital to our success.

48:06.011 --> 48:08.931
A wonderful student-athlete.

48:10.682 --> 48:13.602
And a wonderful friend.

48:13.727 --> 48:16.647
Ladies and gentlemen,
Bobby Boucher!

48:16.730 --> 48:18.815
...[Band]

48:22.277 --> 48:26.865
- [Together] Waterboy, number one!
- You can do it!

48:33.205 --> 48:35.290
Thank you so much...

48:35.499 --> 48:37.501
for bein' my friends.

48:37.584 --> 48:41.672
- [Crowd Cheering]
- You can do it!

48:41.880 --> 48:45.217
I'd also like to take
this opportunity...

48:45.300 --> 48:48.345
to tell you that my mama
don't know how I play football,

48:48.428 --> 48:53.141
so if-if you could not tell
my mama l-I play football,
that would be for the best.

48:53.225 --> 48:55.936
[Cheering]

48:56.144 --> 48:58.021
...[Band Resumes]

49:00.732 --> 49:03.360
[Horn Honking]

49:11.785 --> 49:16.498
We must be a little lost. We're tryin'
to get to the Bourbon Bowl.

49:16.582 --> 49:19.710
Looks like we ended up
in Retardville, U.S.A.

49:22.963 --> 49:27.009
Hey, Waterboy, you fixin'
to tackle all of us?

49:28.802 --> 49:32.764
- Kick his water-lovin' ass, Greg.
- I asked you a question, dumb ass.

49:34.016 --> 49:38.395
You even exhale,
and I will saw your head off.

49:38.478 --> 49:41.732
You can do it!
Cut his fucking head off!

49:43.483 --> 49:47.029
Hold it, hold it. Just a minute.
Now what is the problem here, honey?

49:47.237 --> 49:50.699
I mean, whatever it is,
we don't want this to get physical.

49:50.782 --> 49:52.659
Right, Klein?

49:52.784 --> 49:55.370
[Vicki] Yeah, well, your team actin'
like a bunch of shitheads.

49:55.495 --> 50:00.918
This is not how ambassadors
for the University of Louisiana
are supposed to act.

50:00.918 --> 50:05.589
So now you just get back on the bus.
[Chuckling]

50:05.714 --> 50:10.093
However,
assault with a deadly weapon,

50:10.177 --> 50:12.596
very, very serious offence.

50:12.679 --> 50:16.975
0fficer, get her
little country ass outta here.

50:17.059 --> 50:19.895
- [Crowd Murmuring]
- Thank you, Vicki.

50:19.978 --> 50:22.689
Let's go.

50:22.814 --> 50:27.611
Ah! It's the waterboy!

50:27.819 --> 50:29.571
I got something for you.

50:29.780 --> 50:34.493
This is his transcript from
South Lafayette High School...

50:34.576 --> 50:36.787
in Cherokee Plains,
Louisiana.

50:36.870 --> 50:39.289
Now, the problem with that...

50:39.373 --> 50:44.378
is there ain't no South Lafayette High
School in Cherokee Plains, Louisiana.

50:44.503 --> 50:48.757
- So obviously, this is a fake!
- [Crowd Gasping]

50:48.882 --> 50:52.845
However, this is not a fake.

50:53.053 --> 50:55.639
This is from the N.C.A.A.

50:55.764 --> 50:58.267
They don't think you ought
to play football no more.

50:59.935 --> 51:02.437
So allow me to say this to you
one more time:

51:02.646 --> 51:04.398
You're fired.

51:04.606 --> 51:07.651
0h, no!
We suck again!

51:07.734 --> 51:11.196
Ever see a championship ring?

51:11.405 --> 51:14.825
- Don't be messin' with the champ.
Come on, Laski.
- You didn't go to high school?

51:14.950 --> 51:18.161
I was home schooled.
l-I didn't know I needed...

51:18.287 --> 51:22.666
- Forged a fake transcript.
- No, no, l-l-I didn't.

51:22.749 --> 51:25.460
- The waterboy's a cheater.
Cut his head off.
- [Crowd Agreeing]

51:25.586 --> 51:29.339
Listen, everybody!
This don't change nothin'!

51:29.548 --> 51:32.676
We played as a team,
we won as a team.

51:32.759 --> 51:34.845
And just because
the waterboy's a cheater,

51:34.970 --> 51:37.764
don't change the fact
that the real Mud Dogs...

51:37.890 --> 51:40.267
are gonna kick
some Cougar ass.

51:40.475 --> 51:42.686
Mud Dogs! Mud Dogs!

51:42.895 --> 51:47.482
[Together] Mud Dogs!
Mud Dogs! Mud Dogs! Mud Dogs!

51:47.566 --> 51:51.528
Mud Dogs! Mud Dogs! Mud Dogs!
Mud Dogs! Mud Dogs!

51:51.653 --> 51:55.490
Mud Dogs! Mud Dogs! Mud Dogs!
Mud Dogs! Mud Dogs! Mud Dogs!

51:55.616 --> 51:57.492
- That's the way!
- [Cheering]

52:04.249 --> 52:06.668
Sorry, Bobby.

52:08.629 --> 52:13.342
- 0h, what a lonely boy -

52:13.550 --> 52:16.970
Believe me,
l-I understand.

52:17.095 --> 52:19.598
Yeah, and you're
deeply appreciated, Mr Dodd.

52:19.806 --> 52:23.227
Thank you so much.
Bye-bye.

52:23.352 --> 52:25.521
Good news, Bobby.

52:25.646 --> 52:29.066
- The N.C.A.A. is gonna allow you
to play in the Bourbon Bowl.
- Yes.

52:29.191 --> 52:31.360
You just have to pass the high school
equivalency test.

52:31.568 --> 52:34.821
It's not the test, Coach.

52:34.905 --> 52:38.242
Everybody hates me.

52:38.367 --> 52:41.912
That's not true.

52:41.995 --> 52:45.123
0ne man said he wanted
to decapitate me.

52:45.249 --> 52:49.086
Nobody else thought that
to be too bad of an idea.

52:51.922 --> 52:54.299
Somebody made me
look like a-a-a cheater.

52:54.424 --> 52:57.970
I did it. I did it. I did it!
I did it! I did it!

52:58.053 --> 53:01.932
- It was me.
- Why?

53:05.477 --> 53:10.482
Because I wanted you to play.
Because you were my way out, Bobby.

53:10.566 --> 53:13.694
'Cause it was the only way
to get you in.

53:13.819 --> 53:16.405
I am so sorry.

53:16.530 --> 53:19.241
Why didn't you s-stick up for me
down by the river?

53:22.369 --> 53:26.206
The truth is, I fled.

53:26.331 --> 53:29.042
I came into my office,
I went under my desk, I cried.

53:29.126 --> 53:32.588
I cried. I cried
like a ten-year-old girl!

53:32.671 --> 53:34.756
[Groaning]

53:39.761 --> 53:41.763
Red and I have a history.

53:41.847 --> 53:44.057
Twenty years ago,
we were assistants to Coach Cavanaugh...

53:44.141 --> 53:47.603
at the University
of Louisiana.

53:47.686 --> 53:51.231
Red ran the practices,
and I used to come up with the plays.

53:52.691 --> 53:54.776
0h, boy, was I good.

53:56.570 --> 54:01.241
I would write these foolproof plays
in my little green notebook that I had.

54:01.366 --> 54:04.494
- The opposition
didn't even know what hit 'em.
- [Door Knocking]

54:04.578 --> 54:06.455
And when Coach Cavanaugh
was going to retire,

54:06.580 --> 54:10.000
me and Red, we just knew that one of us
was gonna be his successor.

54:10.125 --> 54:13.253
...[Disco]

54:13.337 --> 54:15.756
- Hey, Red.
- How ya doin'?

54:17.716 --> 54:19.927
Come by to wish me luck?

54:20.010 --> 54:25.641
Well, not exactly, no, no.
Actually, I come by to get you
to do ol' Red a little favour.

54:25.766 --> 54:27.851
Sure. What's up?

54:28.060 --> 54:31.897
Well, you know that green
notebook you use to write
all them football plays in?

54:32.022 --> 54:36.276
Well, I need to show Cavanaugh that
I can come up with some good play ideas.

54:36.401 --> 54:39.321
But you didn't come up
with them.

54:39.404 --> 54:42.658
They're my plays.
I need them.

54:42.866 --> 54:48.372
Klein, I'm gonna have
this book one way or another,

54:48.497 --> 54:51.291
so you might as well let the damn
thing go, 'cause if you don't,

54:51.416 --> 54:54.211
it's gonna get awfully,
awfully physical around here.

54:54.336 --> 54:57.881
And I don't think
you want that, do you? Huh?

01:08:27.232 --> 01:08:29.401
- Yeah!
- [Grunting, Groaning]

01:08:29.526 --> 01:08:33.988
Dan, they're showing no respect
for this team without Boucher.

01:08:34.113 --> 01:08:37.326
[Fouts] Good reason, Brent.
109 yards untouched.

01:08:37.533 --> 01:08:40.037
- [Cheering]
- Touchdown, Cougars! They strike first.

01:08:41.913 --> 01:08:44.207
[Yelling, Shouting]

01:08:47.252 --> 01:08:49.212
- [Whistle Blowing]
- Time running down in the first quarter.

01:08:49.421 --> 01:08:51.631
Cougars lead is 17-0.

01:08:53.509 --> 01:08:55.469
Set!

01:08:55.594 --> 01:08:57.554
Three! Thirty-three!

01:08:57.679 --> 01:09:01.225
- [Growling]
- Three! Thirty-three! Hut!

01:09:03.519 --> 01:09:05.895
Dan, that quarterback can't even
get the ball off before he's hit.

01:09:06.020 --> 01:09:08.189
It's as if they're in
the offensive huddle with him.

01:09:08.314 --> 01:09:12.152
- [Laughing]
- [Muttering]

01:09:12.277 --> 01:09:14.654
Are you gonna finish
that hot dog, Jimmy?

01:09:14.779 --> 01:09:17.073
Ugh! Now I'm not.

01:09:17.157 --> 01:09:20.077
[Bobby] Mama, you think
we'll make it on time?

01:09:20.202 --> 01:09:24.038
Hang on! I'll show you what
A.J. Foyt taught me.

01:09:28.126 --> 01:09:30.837
[Musburger] That's the end of
the half. The Cougars are dominating.

01:09:30.921 --> 01:09:34.883
Let's hope the Mud Dogs
can make some adjustments.

01:09:35.008 --> 01:09:36.885
- Well, they better, 'cause they suck.
- Mm-hmm.

01:09:42.808 --> 01:09:45.018
Anybody got an idea?

01:09:49.189 --> 01:09:51.066
Hey.

01:09:52.943 --> 01:09:57.114
- Remember the time Bobby tackled
the referee by mistake?
- [Chuckling]

01:09:57.197 --> 01:09:59.491
Yeah, that was pretty funny.

01:09:59.616 --> 01:10:01.994
How about the time he tackled
the guy from Louisville...

01:10:02.119 --> 01:10:04.913
- And threw him into the stands?
- [All Laughing]

01:10:06.707 --> 01:10:11.378
Y'all remember when he intercepted
the ball and his pants fell off?

01:10:11.587 --> 01:10:14.923
And then he ran for
the touchdown, bare-assed.

01:10:17.009 --> 01:10:21.305
Remember the time Bobby...
[Mumbling Incoherently]

01:10:27.019 --> 01:10:30.689
Remember when Bobby Boucher
showed up at halftime and the
Mud Dogs won the Bourbon Bowl?

01:10:30.898 --> 01:10:33.483
[Cheering, Shouting]

01:10:37.362 --> 01:10:41.950
Hey, sorry about givin' you
so much shit this year.

01:10:42.034 --> 01:10:44.328
You're the heart and soul
of this team, Bobby.

01:10:44.453 --> 01:10:47.039
And the only one of us
who could've passed that test.

01:10:47.164 --> 01:10:51.001
Thank you all so much
for being my friends.

01:10:51.126 --> 01:10:54.463
Well, let's wait till later
to hold hands and kiss.
We got a Bowl game to win.

01:10:54.671 --> 01:10:56.340
- Right?
- [All Together] Yeah!

01:10:56.548 --> 01:10:58.926
- Two, three!
- [All] Mud Dogs! Woof!

01:10:59.051 --> 01:11:01.970
[Musburger]
In a dramatic turn of events,

01:11:02.054 --> 01:11:05.098
Bobby Boucher
just arrived at halftime.

01:11:05.307 --> 01:11:09.561
And on a fan boat, Brent. His mother
drove him right into the stadium.

01:11:14.066 --> 01:11:18.529
[Players Shouting,
Hooting]

01:11:18.654 --> 01:11:21.448
[Crowd Chanting]
Waterboy! Waterboy!

01:11:21.573 --> 01:11:24.910
Waterboy! Waterboy!

01:11:24.993 --> 01:11:27.829
Waterboy! Waterboy!

01:11:28.038 --> 01:11:30.624
Fool's ball's
not for the devil.

01:11:30.749 --> 01:11:32.626
It's for my Bobby.

01:11:32.835 --> 01:11:36.880
Time to open up
some whoop-ass.

01:11:38.966 --> 01:11:42.845
[Cheering, Chanting
Continues]

01:11:43.053 --> 01:11:46.807
Shit, he showed up.
All right, look.

01:11:46.890 --> 01:11:51.186
Just relax. Relax. Go in there and
do exactly like we planned. Go, go, go!

01:11:51.270 --> 01:11:54.106
This could be the start
of some high drama, folks.

01:11:54.314 --> 01:11:56.483
0r are the Mud Dogs
too far behind?

01:11:56.608 --> 01:11:59.111
Bobby Boucher
is on defence.

01:11:59.319 --> 01:12:02.739
- The Cougars are coming out
from their own 20 yard line.
- [Quarterback] Hut! Hut!

01:12:02.865 --> 01:12:05.367
The pitch.
It's a reverse!

01:12:05.576 --> 01:12:07.953
Boucher's not fooled.

01:12:08.078 --> 01:12:10.873
Fumble!
Robideaux's got it!

01:12:10.998 --> 01:12:12.666
Touchdown, Mud Dogs!

01:12:12.875 --> 01:12:14.751
[Growling]

01:12:14.835 --> 01:12:18.589
- Boy, Boucher knocked
the poop out of him.
- "Poop"?

01:12:18.714 --> 01:12:21.717
[All Shouting]

01:12:21.842 --> 01:12:23.802
Slap hands!
Slap hands!

01:12:25.596 --> 01:12:29.850
Drink up, now. I want you girls to
sober up. Have faith in my Bobby.

01:12:29.975 --> 01:12:32.978
[Musburger] The Mud Dogs are
faced with yet another third and long.

01:12:33.103 --> 01:12:35.189
- Hut!
- Grenouille back to pass.

01:12:35.272 --> 01:12:40.611
He's gonna be stuffed again!
And the Mud Dogs offence is
still unable to move that ball.

01:12:40.694 --> 01:12:43.947
But the way their defence
is fired up, they still have
a shot at winning this game.

01:12:44.031 --> 01:12:46.116
Blake, come here. Look.

01:12:46.241 --> 01:12:49.661
Now, what if we, uh...
[Whispering]

01:12:51.872 --> 01:12:55.209
Trust me. Go, go, go, go, go.
[Evil Laughter]

01:12:55.417 --> 01:12:59.796
[Musburger] The Cougars lead 27-7 in
the middle of the third quarter.

01:12:59.880 --> 01:13:01.965
- And he takes a knee?
- [Whistle Blows]

01:13:02.090 --> 01:13:05.844
- Y'all gonna play or what?
- [Chattering]

01:13:05.928 --> 01:13:09.181
[Laughing]
How do you all like my new offence?

01:13:12.309 --> 01:13:14.061
[Musburger]
All right, it's second and 12...

01:13:14.269 --> 01:13:17.814
- As the Cougars line up on the ball.
- Hut! Hut!

01:13:18.023 --> 01:13:19.900
[Whistle Blows]

01:13:20.108 --> 01:13:23.237
What is Red Beaulieu doing,
refusing to play offence?

01:13:23.445 --> 01:13:26.156
- Dan, this is bizarre.
- [Dan] No, it's not, Brent.

01:13:26.281 --> 01:13:29.618
It's brilliant, because Red is
taking the waterboy out of the game.

01:13:29.701 --> 01:13:32.204
By kneeling down
three times and punting,

01:13:32.329 --> 01:13:34.289
he's gonna make the Mud Dog
offence try to beat him.

01:13:34.414 --> 01:13:36.792
And the way they're playing
today, that's impossible.

01:13:36.917 --> 01:13:39.002
[Musburger] Well, the Mud Dog's
most valuable player,

01:13:39.086 --> 01:13:42.214
the linebacker they call "the Waterboy,"
is now powerless.

01:13:42.422 --> 01:13:47.553
That means Coach Klein will have
to find another way to outfox Red.

01:13:47.636 --> 01:13:52.015
- [Whistle Blows]
- [Man] Mud Dogs call a time-out.

01:13:52.224 --> 01:13:54.852
- [Cheering, Indistinct]
- Mr Coach Klein. Mr Coach Klein!

01:13:54.935 --> 01:13:57.646
Mr Coach Klein!

01:13:57.771 --> 01:14:01.942
- Where are you going?
- I was just gonna get a hot pretzel.

01:14:02.025 --> 01:14:04.862
Mr Coach Klein, are you afraid
of Red Beaulieu?

01:14:04.945 --> 01:14:07.573
[Laughing, Shouting]

01:14:08.699 --> 01:14:10.576
I am petrified of him.

01:14:10.701 --> 01:14:13.704
Well, why don't you pretend
that Red Beaulieu...

01:14:13.912 --> 01:14:15.998
is somebody that
you're-you're not afraid of.

01:14:16.123 --> 01:14:18.834
- Pretend?
- Yes.

01:14:19.042 --> 01:14:21.545
Visualize somebody
you're not afraid of.

01:14:21.628 --> 01:14:24.756
- And then attack, like you told me.
- I'll try.

01:14:24.882 --> 01:14:27.801
Well, he's right over there.

01:14:33.015 --> 01:14:35.809
[Chuckling]

01:14:39.271 --> 01:14:41.440
Little baby.

01:14:41.565 --> 01:14:43.942
Yeah.

01:14:44.067 --> 01:14:48.947
Hello, little baby.
[Baby Talking]

01:14:51.658 --> 01:14:54.494
A poo-poo?
Do you have a poo-poo?

01:14:54.703 --> 01:14:56.455
Yes.

01:14:56.580 --> 01:14:58.957
0kay. Now.

01:14:59.166 --> 01:15:01.460
This is what we're gonna do.
He's gonna come here...

01:15:01.668 --> 01:15:04.171
[Chattering, Shouting]

01:15:09.718 --> 01:15:12.846
Come and get
this one, Cougars.

01:15:12.930 --> 01:15:15.224
Red, 22! Hike!

01:15:15.349 --> 01:15:18.352
[Musburger]
Snap to Grenouille. A reverse!

01:15:18.477 --> 01:15:22.231
No, it's a double reverse!
0h, what a block!

01:15:22.314 --> 01:15:24.191
And Boudier springs free!

01:15:24.316 --> 01:15:28.987
Trouble! Lateral!
Got him! What a play!

01:15:29.196 --> 01:15:32.950
Grenouille to the 15!
To the 10! To the 5!

01:15:33.075 --> 01:15:35.369
- Touchdown, Mud Dogs!
- [Fouts] Well, well, well.

01:15:35.452 --> 01:15:38.080
I guess Coach Klein does have
a few tricks up his sleeve after all.

01:15:38.288 --> 01:15:41.708
What the hell...
What the hell is this? Huh?

01:15:41.834 --> 01:15:45.254
We go from a championship
football team to a bunch of dogs!

01:15:45.379 --> 01:15:48.799
Right now, we're going to go down to
the sidelines and our man, Lynn Swann.

01:15:48.924 --> 01:15:51.009
Swannie, what do
you have for us?

01:15:51.218 --> 01:15:52.970
I'm with Vicki Vallencourt,
who's taking over...

01:15:53.178 --> 01:15:56.098
Bobby Boucher's water duties
for this important game.

01:15:56.223 --> 01:15:59.226
0h, I'm not takin' over.
I'm just tryin' not to screw up too bad.

01:15:59.351 --> 01:16:02.688
Well, let me ask you this.
What's your prediction for
the rest of this ball game?

01:16:02.771 --> 01:16:04.857
Mud Dogs are gonna win,
30 to 27.

01:16:04.982 --> 01:16:07.568
That's very interesting.
How'd you come up with that guess?

01:16:07.776 --> 01:16:11.113
Guess? That ain't no guess!
That's what it's gonna be.

01:16:11.238 --> 01:16:14.241
- 0kay. That's fine.
- 0h! Be careful down there, Swannie.

01:16:17.703 --> 01:16:20.289
All right.
Meaney. Where's Meaney?

01:16:20.414 --> 01:16:22.374
- Meaney?
- Here, Coach.

01:16:22.499 --> 01:16:26.044
- Get in there and let's see if
that waterboy can stop you.
- Yes, sir!

01:16:26.128 --> 01:16:30.299
Red is sending his best defender in
as a running back?

01:16:30.424 --> 01:16:32.926
What do you make of this, Dan?

01:16:33.135 --> 01:16:35.304
Well, Brent, he's gotta find
some way to neutralize the waterboy.

01:16:35.429 --> 01:16:38.849
He probably thinks that Meaney
will just pound it in there like
Fridge used to do for the Bears.

01:16:38.974 --> 01:16:42.603
Hey, Waterboy! Is your girlfriend
gonna save you again?

01:16:42.728 --> 01:16:44.897
0h, no, sir. I'm gonna take matters
into my own hands.

01:16:45.022 --> 01:16:49.067
- You'll see.
- Bring it to the hole!
Your ass is mine! Whoo!

01:16:49.193 --> 01:16:51.987
Whoo! Whoo!

01:16:52.112 --> 01:16:54.198
You sound like a...
a big choo-choo train.

01:16:54.281 --> 01:16:57.743
Whoo!
[Groans]

01:17:04.208 --> 01:17:07.628
Power bomb, compliments
of Captain Insano.

01:17:11.298 --> 01:17:14.301
- Let's go fight
with your might...

01:17:14.426 --> 01:17:17.221
All right, field goal.
Field goal. Go.

01:17:17.346 --> 01:17:20.766
- Derek. Derek!
- Yeah.

01:17:20.891 --> 01:17:24.019
Visualize the attack.
Go kick the ball. Kick it.

01:17:24.102 --> 01:17:25.896
- Hut!
- [All Grunting]

01:17:27.439 --> 01:17:29.525
How you doin', boy?
[Laughing]

01:17:29.650 --> 01:17:32.236
No, no, no!
[Screaming]

01:17:35.072 --> 01:17:37.658
[Cheering, Shouting]

01:17:45.082 --> 01:17:47.668
[Whimpering]

01:17:52.172 --> 01:17:56.343
[Players Shouting,
Indistinct]

01:17:56.552 --> 01:17:58.720
What the hell is that?

01:18:04.768 --> 01:18:08.313
Where the hell is... What the hell
is he up to? That ain't in here! Huh?

01:18:08.438 --> 01:18:10.315
- [Cheering]
- Hey!

01:18:10.399 --> 01:18:12.401
[Musburger]
Down by ten late in the fourth quarter,

01:18:12.609 --> 01:18:15.112
Coach Klein
opts for the field goal.

01:18:15.195 --> 01:18:18.740
[Fouts]
Then they have to hope for the onside
kick and a touchdown to tie the game.

01:18:18.866 --> 01:18:23.120
Dan, look what we have here.
Boucher's in the game as a blocker.

01:18:23.245 --> 01:18:25.539
Last game of the year, Brent.
Can't hold anything back now.

01:18:28.250 --> 01:18:30.627
Set!

01:18:33.672 --> 01:18:35.632
The snap. It's a fake!

01:18:39.303 --> 01:18:42.639
Boucher's out in front!
A great block!

01:18:42.723 --> 01:18:46.059
- [Grunting]
- And a second one!

01:18:46.185 --> 01:18:48.687
Touchdown, Mud Dogs!

01:18:48.770 --> 01:18:52.232
- Boucher led him all the way!
- [Screaming] Yeah!

01:18:54.735 --> 01:18:56.612
Red Beaulieu
is steaming, Dan.

01:18:56.695 --> 01:18:58.989
Brent, he sees his
perfect season slipping away.

01:18:59.198 --> 01:19:02.743
The Cougar's lead
is down to three.

01:19:02.868 --> 01:19:07.331
[Cheerleaders Cheering,
Indistinct]

01:19:07.456 --> 01:19:10.667
The Mud Dogs need the ball back if
they're gonna have a shot at overtime.

01:19:10.876 --> 01:19:14.421
And Bobby Boucher is
now on the kickoff team.

01:19:14.546 --> 01:19:18.175
- Last game of the year, Brent.
Can't hold anything back now.
- I know.

01:19:18.300 --> 01:19:21.637
- [Horns Blaring]
- Who's it gonna be?

01:19:21.845 --> 01:19:25.390
Who's it gonna be?
Who's it gonna be?

01:19:28.727 --> 01:19:31.730
[Chuckling]
0h, yeah. There's my bitch.

01:19:31.855 --> 01:19:34.358
[Musburger] Remember,
the ball must travel ten yards.

01:19:36.944 --> 01:19:38.946
It's loose!

01:19:39.029 --> 01:19:42.074
- Mud Dogs football! Mud Dogs football!
- All right!

01:19:42.282 --> 01:19:44.243
Mama, I got the football!
I got it...

01:19:44.451 --> 01:19:47.079
0h, what a vicious hit!
That was a cheap shot.

01:19:47.162 --> 01:19:48.956
- 0h!
- [Murmuring]

01:19:49.039 --> 01:19:51.542
- [Whistle Blowing]
- [Fouts] And what a dumb penalty.

01:19:51.667 --> 01:19:54.878
That puts the Mud Dogs
in field goal range for the tie.

01:19:55.087 --> 01:19:58.549
- Dan, I'm not sure that Boucher
is able to get back up.
- 0h, my baby!

01:20:05.639 --> 01:20:07.724
It's still cold.
[Chuckles]

01:20:07.808 --> 01:20:10.727
- [Chattering]
- Excuse me. 0ut of my way.

01:20:14.189 --> 01:20:16.900
Dan, you hate
to see this happen.

01:20:25.325 --> 01:20:28.245
Now, that's
high quality H20.

01:20:28.370 --> 01:20:32.332
- [Cheering]
- [Vicki] You go on, now!
Make it happen, Bobby!

01:20:36.503 --> 01:20:38.672
The waterboy
just needed some water.

01:20:38.797 --> 01:20:43.385
- Wow, Dan. You think that up
all by yourself?
- Shut up, Brent.

01:20:46.722 --> 01:20:48.390
- [Shouting, Yelling]
- Are you okay?

01:20:48.473 --> 01:20:50.684
He tried to open up a can
of whoop-ass on me. I wouldn't let him.

01:20:50.767 --> 01:20:54.521
Listen, I have an idea for the last
play. You haven't done this before.

01:20:54.646 --> 01:20:56.523
All right? The offence
is gonna line up like this.

01:20:56.607 --> 01:20:58.483
- Yeah.
- You're gonna be right here.

01:20:58.609 --> 01:21:00.777
[Musburger]
There'll be no tie here today.

01:21:00.903 --> 01:21:04.531
Coach Klein is sending
his offence back on to the field.

01:21:04.656 --> 01:21:06.742
He's going for
the win right now.

01:21:06.950 --> 01:21:08.702
[Fouts] Yeah, this is
a real gutsy call, Brent.

01:21:08.827 --> 01:21:10.787
He'll either be a hero
or a goat because of this.

01:21:10.913 --> 01:21:15.501
[Musburger] And Dan,
Bobby Boucher is back on the field.

01:21:15.709 --> 01:21:19.546
He is now playing offence!
We know. We know.

01:21:19.671 --> 01:21:23.008
Meaney, if they give
that Waterboy the football,

01:21:23.091 --> 01:21:24.968
I don't care if you
have to stab him!

01:21:25.093 --> 01:21:27.387
Do not let him get away.
Do you understand me?

01:21:27.471 --> 01:21:31.225
- Yes, sir. Yes, sir!
- Do you understand me? Get in there!

01:21:31.350 --> 01:21:33.644
[All]
Break!

01:21:40.192 --> 01:21:44.363
- I'm ready, friend.
- Let's do it, Bobby.

01:21:45.614 --> 01:21:48.033
Set! Set!

01:21:48.242 --> 01:21:51.578
Forty-three! Set!
Forty-three! Hut, hut!

01:23:08.947 --> 01:23:11.867
Touchdown! They win it!
The Mud Dogs win it!

01:23:12.075 --> 01:23:16.246
Bobby Boucher's the hero! He's gone
from waterboy, Dan, to saviour!

01:23:16.330 --> 01:23:18.540
And it's because he didn't
hold anything back!

01:23:18.624 --> 01:23:22.169
Well, Swannie's down on the field
with our hero, so let's go to Lynn now!

01:23:25.088 --> 01:23:29.051
We did it! I can't believe it!
I can't believe it!

01:23:29.176 --> 01:23:32.179
- Vicki, I love you!
- Whoo! I love you, too, baby.

01:23:32.304 --> 01:23:36.058
We're the champions!
[Screaming]

01:23:36.141 --> 01:23:40.020
Mr Coach Klein, you got your manhood!
You got your manhood!

01:23:40.229 --> 01:23:43.440
Bobby, congratulations.
You're the M.V.P. of the Bourbon Bowl.

01:23:43.565 --> 01:23:45.442
How do you feel?

01:23:45.526 --> 01:23:49.071
- I love Mama!
- [Cheering]

01:24:07.422 --> 01:24:09.925
- There you go, Bobby!
- Lookin' sharp, Bobby!

01:24:10.050 --> 01:24:11.927
[Man]
You the man, Bobby!

01:24:12.135 --> 01:24:14.721
Bobby, I've been dreading
this day for a long time.

01:24:14.847 --> 01:24:18.267
- But you got yourself a fine woman.
- 0h, thank you, Mama.

01:24:18.392 --> 01:24:21.186
Good luck, son.

01:24:21.311 --> 01:24:23.272
This is the best day
of my life!

01:24:24.731 --> 01:24:26.817
You just wait till tonight.

01:24:27.025 --> 01:24:29.736
- What's gonna happen tonight?
- [Chuckles] You'll see.

01:24:29.862 --> 01:24:35.158
You can do it!
You can do it all night long!

01:24:35.284 --> 01:24:38.495
[Cheering, Shouting]

01:24:38.620 --> 01:24:41.415
I'm gonna go do it!

01:24:46.753 --> 01:24:49.882
- [Tyres Screech]
- Bobby, it's me!

01:24:50.090 --> 01:24:53.510
- Your daddy, Roberto.
- Daddy?

01:24:53.719 --> 01:24:58.515
I've seen you on the ESPN
when they was talkin' about
you being drafted by the NFL.

01:24:58.724 --> 01:25:02.394
Not going to the NFL.
I'm gonna stay in school and graduate.

01:25:02.477 --> 01:25:06.356
The hell with school, dopey! Take the
money! You and me could be partners,

01:25:06.440 --> 01:25:09.902
- Just like that Tiger Woods
and his daddy.
- [Mama Screaming]

01:25:10.110 --> 01:25:12.487
- Uh-oh.
- [Screaming]

01:25:12.613 --> 01:25:14.698
- [Grunting]
- [All Gasping]

01:25:14.781 --> 01:25:18.535
[Crowd Cheering]

01:25:18.660 --> 01:25:21.663
- Nice hit, Mama.
- Thanks, baby.

01:25:21.788 --> 01:25:24.166
Now, you go on and have
some fun becoming a man.

01:25:34.176 --> 01:25:38.972
- I don't remember
what day it was -

01:25:40.557 --> 01:25:45.020
- I didn't notice
what time it was -

01:25:46.897 --> 01:25:52.444
- All I know is that
I fell in love with you -

01:25:52.653 --> 01:25:55.447
- And if all my dreams
come true -

01:25:55.572 --> 01:25:59.201

01:26:17.970 --> 01:26:20.681

01:26:20.806 --> 01:26:24.643

01:26:56.466 --> 01:27:00.929

Be on your way -
