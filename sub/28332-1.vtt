WEBVTT

00:11.469 --> 00:15.306
Please welcome my daddy, Nate Bargatze.

00:33.575 --> 00:34.451
We're doing it.

00:34.951 --> 00:35.910
This is it.

00:36.536 --> 00:38.538
This is, you know, it's something.

00:38.955 --> 00:40.290
-Uh...

00:40.707 --> 00:43.460
Thank you, guys, for coming out.
I appreciate it. Uh...

00:43.543 --> 00:44.544
I'm very excited.

00:45.086 --> 00:46.588
I tried to, uh...

00:46.963 --> 00:49.924
I'm always trying to lose weight,
and then you think, "I'll tape a special.

00:50.008 --> 00:53.386
That will, you know... That'll do it."
And then you just kind of...

00:53.470 --> 00:55.847
Next thing you know,
it's already started, so...

01:00.226 --> 01:01.102
I...

01:02.228 --> 01:04.355
I had a thing that happened that I do,

01:04.439 --> 01:06.733
where it's like,
"I gotta get it together." Like, I...

01:06.983 --> 01:08.359
I like to golf,

01:08.443 --> 01:11.696
and so I tend to bring clubs
and I'll golf on the road.

01:11.780 --> 01:14.532
And so I was in Florida,
and we go golfing.

01:14.824 --> 01:16.701
It's very hot, humid, gross.

01:16.785 --> 01:18.369
You get kind of feeling gross.

01:18.578 --> 01:21.581
So I wanted to change shirts
before I drove back,

01:21.664 --> 01:25.585
and I go to the trunk of my car,
and I take my shirt off.

01:25.668 --> 01:27.170
Standing there, no shirt,

01:27.253 --> 01:30.131
and this old man walks up
and goes, "Olivia?"

01:39.516 --> 01:43.019
I had to turn. I was like, "I'm sorry,
what'd you just say? I'm sorry."

01:43.311 --> 01:45.647
And he was like,
"Oh, sorry, honest mistake."

01:45.730 --> 01:47.774
And I was like, "I don't know. Uh..."

01:49.192 --> 01:51.027
He was looking for his elderly wife,

01:51.361 --> 01:52.445
and saw...

01:53.029 --> 01:54.739
me with no shirt on,

01:55.490 --> 01:57.867
and thought that could be Olivia,

01:58.201 --> 02:00.620
at a car that he does not recognize.

02:01.329 --> 02:03.248
None of this is making him not...

02:03.331 --> 02:06.417
He's like, "I don't know,
that's a dead ringer for Olivia."

02:11.339 --> 02:15.176
I don't know who he disrespected more,
me or Olivia, to be honest. I mean...

02:16.094 --> 02:17.679
we could both have a word with him.

02:22.183 --> 02:25.436
I travel, uh, all the time, and if I...

02:25.770 --> 02:27.897
if I fly... if I fly Delta,

02:27.981 --> 02:30.859
if I buy a ticket through Delta's system,

02:31.067 --> 02:33.236
my name in their system is Nathan.

02:33.528 --> 02:35.864
And on my license, my name is Nathaniel.

02:36.197 --> 02:38.867
I do not remember making this decision.

02:41.411 --> 02:44.372
It's a big deal. You can't just change it.
I've tried.

02:44.455 --> 02:48.418
I've asked Delta if they could change it,
and they're like, "We can't change it."

02:48.501 --> 02:49.961
And you're like, "Then I don't know.

02:50.044 --> 02:51.963
I don't know where we go from here,"
you know?

02:52.797 --> 02:55.091
If you can't do it, who can do it?
I mean...

02:56.134 --> 02:58.428
Do you call...
Is that why people call senators?

02:58.511 --> 03:00.388
Do they do it? 'Cause I don't know...

03:06.477 --> 03:07.687
What you have to do,

03:07.770 --> 03:10.273
you have to mail
your birth certificate in.

03:10.857 --> 03:14.652
Some moms give their children
their birth certificates.

03:15.737 --> 03:17.405
I've never received mine.

03:18.698 --> 03:21.242
I thought I was the proof of my birth.

03:23.119 --> 03:26.247
And you gotta mail it in.
I've never been a big mailing-in guy.

03:26.497 --> 03:27.540
I've mailed...

03:27.999 --> 03:29.792
maybe four letters my entire life.

03:29.876 --> 03:31.127
I've just never done it.

03:31.211 --> 03:32.629
Stamps make me nervous.

03:34.005 --> 03:36.758
Because I don't know how many
you're supposed to put on. Like...

03:36.841 --> 03:39.761
Where they're gonna be like,
"You should put one more on." Uh...

03:40.762 --> 03:44.599
And they change the price of stamps,
and that's not in the news, you know?

03:45.725 --> 03:48.102
You don't find that out on Twitter.

03:48.186 --> 03:51.773
You have to find out from old people.
They're the only people that know.

03:54.192 --> 03:55.026
They keep up with it.

03:55.109 --> 03:57.946
They'll be like, "Stamps went up."
You're like, "Okay. Uh...

03:58.029 --> 03:59.030
All right.

04:00.615 --> 04:02.909
Is it $100?" Like, they're furious.

04:04.285 --> 04:05.787
"Is it $100 a stamp?"

04:06.496 --> 04:07.830
"It's three more pennies."

04:10.959 --> 04:11.793
So...

04:12.877 --> 04:16.673
I will never go through that process
to get my name changed.

04:16.756 --> 04:17.840
I just deal with it.

04:18.174 --> 04:20.093
And... it gets brought up.

04:20.176 --> 04:21.678
Once, I was checking a bag,

04:21.761 --> 04:24.305
and the guy behind the counter,
he sees my ticket says "Nathan,"

04:24.389 --> 04:26.182
the license says "Nathaniel,"

04:26.266 --> 04:28.643
and he was like...
"This is not good."

04:31.813 --> 04:33.189
He goes, "These names don't match."

04:33.273 --> 04:35.525
And I was like,
"But they match, right? Like...

04:36.526 --> 04:39.737
You can see the leap that we took
to get from one to the other."

04:44.993 --> 04:48.329
He was like, "But they're not the same."
I was like, "They're the same." And...

04:48.413 --> 04:52.917
I'm realizing he cannot find out people
call me Nate at that point, because...

04:53.710 --> 04:55.169
I mean, he can't handle that.

04:55.253 --> 04:57.088
He's gonna call the police over
to be like,

04:57.171 --> 04:59.549
"There's a guy with three names
trying to fly right here,

04:59.632 --> 05:02.260
if you guys wanna just shoot him
from over there or something."

05:05.555 --> 05:08.474
I was like, "What do you want me to do?"
And he goes, "You should go home."

05:08.558 --> 05:10.143
That's, like, honest, he's like...

05:11.436 --> 05:13.438
"I can't believe you've made it this far."

05:15.356 --> 05:18.484
I was like, "Let me just try it.
You know? Shouldn't I try it?"

05:19.485 --> 05:22.405
I said, "Look, I'll give you
that those names don't match.

05:22.488 --> 05:24.782
But what I think is gonna help a ton

05:24.866 --> 05:27.201
is the picture on the ID.

05:28.995 --> 05:32.332
Something that I've always loved
that they did, and I think...

05:34.167 --> 05:38.212
with 70 percent of that name matching,
and 100 percent face...

05:40.715 --> 05:42.383
That's 100 and 70 percent.

05:45.386 --> 05:46.596
I think I'll get through."

05:49.349 --> 05:52.477
And this is what he told me. This is
honestly what he said. He goes, uh...

05:52.560 --> 05:54.520
He goes, "Look, man, I get it. All right?"

05:54.604 --> 05:57.690
He was trying to relate to me,
and he was like, "My name's Joseph.

05:57.774 --> 05:59.192
That's what's on my license.

05:59.442 --> 06:02.320
So I can't buy a ticket
under my nickname, 'Bart.'

06:02.403 --> 06:03.863
They're not gonna let me through."

06:05.698 --> 06:08.368
And he said it like, "Right? You know?
Does that makes sense?"

06:08.451 --> 06:11.954
And I was like, "That doesn't at all.
Those are two different names. All right?"

06:12.038 --> 06:14.040
I should be over there,
and you should be over here,

06:14.123 --> 06:15.875
because that's how you're treating me.

06:15.958 --> 06:17.460
Like I'm a Joseph Bart.

06:22.673 --> 06:23.758
I made it through.

06:24.258 --> 06:25.593
And on that trip,

06:25.676 --> 06:28.054
uh, I was going to Seattle.

06:28.596 --> 06:30.473
And if you've ever been to Seattle,

06:30.556 --> 06:32.809
uh, Mount Rainier is near Seattle,

06:32.892 --> 06:35.395
that's what they call it, and...

06:35.728 --> 06:36.938
I don't... That's...

06:37.021 --> 06:39.565
I don't know if that's true.
Just so y'all... Uh...

06:39.649 --> 06:41.818
It felt like y'all took that like, "Yeah."

06:41.901 --> 06:43.486
-Uh...

06:45.446 --> 06:46.406
So...

06:47.115 --> 06:49.826
We were going out to Mt. Rainier,
and I was with a buddy of mine.

06:49.909 --> 06:54.372
And Mt. Rainier is the... It's the third
biggest mountain in America.

06:54.455 --> 06:56.249
It's a good one to go to.

06:56.332 --> 06:58.584
I don't know who number one
or number two is,

06:58.918 --> 07:01.629
but maybe one day,
it'll be number one, you know?

07:02.046 --> 07:04.799
Do mountains keep growing?
I don't think we know that yet.

07:05.800 --> 07:07.093
So it's a good time to see it.

07:07.176 --> 07:09.429
It doesn't have the attitude
of a one or a two.

07:12.598 --> 07:15.143
So, me and my buddy, we rented a car.
He's driving.

07:15.351 --> 07:18.354
On the way out there,
I see a dead horse...

07:18.771 --> 07:21.441
just laid out in this guy's yard.

07:21.899 --> 07:22.984
I've never seen that before,

07:23.067 --> 07:26.571
and I was like, "Man, I bet you don't
think about that when you buy a horse...

07:26.654 --> 07:27.488
it dying."

07:27.572 --> 07:30.783
You know, what do you do?
That's a huge thing dying in your yard.

07:31.033 --> 07:34.120
You can't just scoot it off
into the woods with your foot,

07:34.495 --> 07:37.832
and try to get another one that matches
before the kids come home.

07:39.459 --> 07:41.836
You have to tell your wife
to keep the kids away for a month.

07:41.919 --> 07:43.963
You gotta google
"how to move a dead horse."

07:45.256 --> 07:47.842
You gotta probably try to get
another horse to help you do it,

07:47.925 --> 07:49.510
and that's not easy.

07:50.052 --> 07:52.096
That's what the blinders
were invented for,

07:52.180 --> 07:54.849
'cause it's like, "Just look ahead.
Don't worry about what's going on.

07:54.932 --> 07:55.808
No, look!"

07:58.269 --> 07:59.896
Or you gotta get your friends to help you,

07:59.979 --> 08:02.315
and you can't spill the beans
too quick on that.

08:02.398 --> 08:05.985
You think it's hard for them to help you
move a couch, try a dead horse.

08:07.153 --> 08:09.197
You gotta lie to them.
Like, "We're getting a divorce.

08:09.280 --> 08:11.866
Just come over.
Bring your truck and some gloves."

08:16.078 --> 08:19.207
When they get there, let me tell you,
they're gonna see it, all right?

08:19.290 --> 08:20.333
Everybody saw it.

08:20.791 --> 08:22.126
It was next to the road.

08:22.210 --> 08:24.837
And they're gonna pull into that driveway
and just be like,

08:24.921 --> 08:27.298
"I don't think
they're getting a divorce at all.

08:28.591 --> 08:31.511
I think we're here to move that dead horse
is what I think.

08:34.347 --> 08:37.225
Let's let him bring it up.
All right, make him ask.

08:38.476 --> 08:41.479
But I'll be shocked if we don't touch
that dead horse today."

08:47.193 --> 08:50.863
And if you ever have to move a dead horse,
I've thought a lot about all this.

08:51.239 --> 08:54.033
You want to be the first one to the horse.
All right?

08:54.116 --> 08:57.453
You don't want someone else to tell you
where to grab a dead horse.

08:57.870 --> 08:59.664
So you run out there, like you love it,

08:59.747 --> 09:02.041
like, you're like,
"This what I hoped it was," and...

09:02.124 --> 09:05.253
get to the hoofs in the front,
and be like, "All right, I'm here.

09:05.336 --> 09:07.713
You guys decide
where you guys want to be."

09:12.969 --> 09:16.305
So, now we're basically at Mount Rainier.

09:16.389 --> 09:18.724
That was the whole car ride, and...

09:20.226 --> 09:21.936
if you ever go, just so you know,
uh, you have to pay to go up it.

09:23.813 --> 09:24.814
It's not a free mountain.

09:24.897 --> 09:27.483
Someone bought it,
and they're charging tickets.

09:29.068 --> 09:31.445
It's also all uphill. It's a nightmare.

09:31.529 --> 09:33.948
So, be ready for those things.

09:35.491 --> 09:39.245
We drive up, we park,
and we're walking up the trail.

09:39.537 --> 09:41.080
So, we're going up it.

09:41.163 --> 09:43.249
Halfway, I mean, I can barely breathe.

09:43.958 --> 09:46.419
And this couple's coming down,
so I stopped them.

09:46.502 --> 09:48.337
I was like, "Hey, is this enough?

09:48.421 --> 09:51.257
Where we're at, you know?
Is this, like, you get it.

09:51.340 --> 09:53.301
Like, we're not trying
to live on this mountain."

09:54.510 --> 09:57.513
And the lady goes,
"I'm 75 years old, and I did it."

09:57.597 --> 10:01.434
And I was like, "Maybe that's why you
didn't hear the question that I asked."

10:06.105 --> 10:09.108
Everybody's pretty cocky
on the way down, I mean...

10:10.526 --> 10:11.819
There was women with babies,

10:11.902 --> 10:13.696
three-month-old babies
strapped to their chest.

10:13.779 --> 10:16.032
I was like, "Why would you bring
that much weight with you?

10:16.115 --> 10:17.575
I left my wallet in the car."

10:17.658 --> 10:19.327
-They looked exhausted.

10:19.410 --> 10:21.370
I'm surprised there's not just
babies left up there

10:21.454 --> 10:24.040
and rangers have to come down,
"Whose baby is this?"

10:24.457 --> 10:27.710
"That's ours. We were gonna let it
grow up and come down on its own."

10:30.713 --> 10:33.424
So, we get our picture,
and we come back down,

10:33.716 --> 10:34.925
and we're driving back.

10:35.134 --> 10:37.762
And on the way back,
since my buddy was driving,

10:37.845 --> 10:41.098
he did not see the dead horse, you know?

10:41.182 --> 10:43.017
And I'm like, "We can't <i>not </i>see it."

10:43.851 --> 10:47.021
So, it's just one road, and I was like,
"I'll just show you where it's at."

10:47.104 --> 10:49.065
So we get...
We're driving, and we get to it.

10:49.148 --> 10:50.983
I was like, "It's right here,"
and I pointed,

10:51.067 --> 10:54.153
and the horse was standing up,
doing unbelievable.

10:57.698 --> 11:00.117
One of the healthier horses
that I've ever seen.

11:02.745 --> 11:06.165
So I learned
that horses lay down to sleep.

11:06.666 --> 11:07.917
I did not know that.

11:11.087 --> 11:14.256
I don't know what I thought
before that day. I don't know.

11:14.548 --> 11:16.842
That they lock their knees,
that's why they have four knees.

11:16.926 --> 11:20.429
I don't know, that's what I... I would
have probably argued with you about it.

11:24.016 --> 11:25.351
People put signs up

11:25.643 --> 11:27.895
that say, like, "Horses lay down.
Don't call 911,"

11:27.978 --> 11:29.730
'cause people call the police.

11:30.898 --> 11:35.403
They drive by a horse
laying down in some guy's yard,

11:35.778 --> 11:39.073
and they're like, "Y'all guys should go,
like, deal with that." And they're like...

11:39.615 --> 11:41.117
Some people knock on people's door.

11:41.200 --> 11:43.369
"Hey, is your dad home?
Your horse died outside.

11:43.452 --> 11:46.288
I thought you should hear it
from a stranger first."

11:46.372 --> 11:47.206
Uh...

11:52.837 --> 11:54.171
I'm, uh... I'm married.

11:54.255 --> 11:55.214
I'm still married.

11:55.297 --> 11:57.091
-And I--

11:57.174 --> 11:58.467
Thanks, yeah.

11:59.051 --> 12:00.845
I, uh... I like to say it.

12:00.928 --> 12:02.972
You know, like I'm at the same job.

12:03.055 --> 12:04.807
Just like, "Yeah, no, I still work there.

12:04.890 --> 12:06.434
-Uh...

12:06.517 --> 12:09.103
Yeah, right out of school.
Only job I applied for."

12:09.186 --> 12:10.354
-Uh...

12:12.440 --> 12:13.983
My wife will tell me that...

12:14.650 --> 12:17.570
She always says that I don't like
the way she talks,

12:17.903 --> 12:18.946
and it's not her voice.

12:19.029 --> 12:20.531
I like the sound of her voice.

12:20.740 --> 12:23.284
That'd be a big problem, I think,
if it was like, "It's your voice.

12:23.367 --> 12:24.285
I just hate it."

12:25.911 --> 12:28.748
To go to couples' therapy,
and be like, "Can <i>you </i>hear it? Right?"

12:28.831 --> 12:30.458
-Like, it's not--

12:30.541 --> 12:32.710
You know? It's not fun.

12:35.921 --> 12:39.258
It's the information
that she chooses to tell me at times.

12:41.218 --> 12:44.054
We took a trip to Florida,
to Fort Lauderdale,

12:44.138 --> 12:47.850
and her and our daughter are flying
from Nashville where we live,

12:47.933 --> 12:49.351
and I'm flying from Detroit.

12:49.435 --> 12:51.771
We're meeting
at Fort Lauderdale's airport.

12:52.104 --> 12:54.231
I have to find them when they land.

12:54.315 --> 12:56.317
So I called her,
'cause I was about to take off,
and I was like,
"What time do you guys leave?"

12:58.486 --> 12:59.612
She goes, "Noon."

12:59.695 --> 13:01.906
And it was 11:30,
and they're still at home.

13:01.989 --> 13:05.451
I was like, "Laura, I don't know
if you even know what an airport is.

13:08.788 --> 13:12.166
But if that plane was in our driveway,
I don't think you could make it."

13:16.754 --> 13:18.756
She said, "That's what time
we leave for the airport.

13:18.839 --> 13:20.090
Our flight's not till 1:30."

13:20.174 --> 13:22.092
And I was like, "All right. All right.

13:22.760 --> 13:25.638
So, what do you think I wanted to know
when I asked that?

13:31.727 --> 13:33.854
Is that what you thought
the best time you could give me

13:33.938 --> 13:36.190
was a time that means nothing to nobody?

13:37.775 --> 13:39.276
What time did you go to bed last night?

13:39.360 --> 13:42.905
Just tell me that and I'll just look up
all the planes that land in Florida,

13:42.988 --> 13:45.157
and I'll guess which one
I think you're on."

13:48.118 --> 13:50.538
She said, "I'm sorry I don't talk
the way you want me to talk."

13:50.621 --> 13:53.624
I'm like, "I want you to talk
like a regular person, all right?

13:54.124 --> 13:56.585
Like you've been around people before,
you know?"

13:59.463 --> 14:02.299
We didn't talk in Florida,
I'll tell you that. Uh...

14:09.682 --> 14:12.351
She's good at not talking to me.
She can go a long time.

14:12.852 --> 14:14.854
She could do her whole marriage career.

14:17.022 --> 14:20.901
We... Marriage fights are great,
because they're all very dumb.

14:21.694 --> 14:26.532
I would say 90 percent of them are dumb,
ten percent the cops show up, but...

14:29.743 --> 14:31.620
We got in a fight, uh,

14:31.704 --> 14:33.330
once, over chocolate milk.

14:34.790 --> 14:36.625
We didn't talk for 24 hours.

14:39.128 --> 14:41.964
What happened is,
I brought chocolate milk home,

14:42.047 --> 14:44.091
and she was like,
"Why did you bring it home?"

14:44.174 --> 14:47.344
And I was like, "You're supposed
to drink it after you workout."

14:47.887 --> 14:50.055
And she was like, "That's not true."

14:50.139 --> 14:52.182
And I was like,
"Well, there's a commercial on TV.

14:52.266 --> 14:54.894
They probably looked into it
more than you did, so...

14:55.477 --> 14:57.187
I decided to listen to them."

14:58.522 --> 15:01.442
And she said. "That's just the milk people
pushing chocolate milk."

15:01.525 --> 15:04.820
And I was like, "You don't even know
what that statement means.

15:04.904 --> 15:08.282
You don't know if there's milk people,
and I think chocolate milk is doing fine.

15:08.365 --> 15:10.701
I don't think they're sitting
on barrels of it,

15:11.201 --> 15:12.828
and they're like,
'We got to make up a lie.

15:12.912 --> 15:14.788
We gotta get rid of this chocolate milk!'"

15:19.501 --> 15:21.921
She went to college, all right,
and I did not,

15:22.004 --> 15:24.089
but she did not study chocolate milk,

15:24.173 --> 15:26.216
when is it good and not good for you.

15:30.012 --> 15:31.513
To be fair to her, though,

15:31.597 --> 15:33.265
I do not work out.

15:33.515 --> 15:34.433
So...

15:36.435 --> 15:38.270
You know?
But I was probably gonna start,

15:38.354 --> 15:40.356
and I needed to get all the stuff there.

15:44.026 --> 15:46.362
Do you ever get in those fights?
Like, you'll be at home,

15:46.445 --> 15:49.198
you and your spouse, and you guys
are not talking to each other,

15:49.281 --> 15:51.325
and... But you're in the house together,

15:51.408 --> 15:53.035
no kids, the house is quiet,

15:53.535 --> 15:55.245
and you just stay on opposite ends,

15:55.329 --> 15:57.539
and then you pass each other
in the hallway.

15:58.165 --> 16:00.542
That's the funniest part,
'cause you don't live in a mansion.

16:00.626 --> 16:01.710
You have one hallway.

16:03.003 --> 16:04.713
And you just didn't time it out right,

16:04.797 --> 16:07.466
and you just have to walk by each other
like strangers.

16:07.549 --> 16:10.427
You're like, "Oh, excuse me. Sorry.
Yeah, no, go ahead."

16:14.515 --> 16:16.976
She'll be watching TV,
I'm like, "Ma'am, are you watching this?

16:17.059 --> 16:20.062
I couldn't tell, I was going to change it
if you weren't watching it."

16:23.941 --> 16:27.027
It's the silent treatment. The silent
treatment is a very common thing.

16:27.111 --> 16:28.487
Everybody knows what it is.

16:28.988 --> 16:31.490
Uh, I think women
are just born knowing it.

16:31.573 --> 16:33.158
I don't think you're taught it.

16:33.242 --> 16:36.370
I don't think it's like,
"My mom did it, and her mom..."

16:37.913 --> 16:41.959
It's an instinct that's in us all,
that we all just know.

16:42.251 --> 16:45.045
And here's what made me,
uh, think of that.

16:45.379 --> 16:49.008
I re-watched the movie <i>Sixth Sense,</i>

16:49.550 --> 16:51.677
and I'm not trying to do a six-inch joke.

16:51.760 --> 16:53.762
This is a 20-year-old movie.

16:55.014 --> 16:56.557
I also have to spoil it,

16:56.849 --> 16:58.517
but it's... I mean, it's 20 years old.

16:58.600 --> 16:59.977
So, if...

17:01.395 --> 17:04.565
If you don't know by now,
I don't know what to tell you, you know?
And don't be like,
"We were gonna watch it tonight. Uh...

17:09.611 --> 17:12.448
We were gonna go to Blockbuster
on the way home, and...

17:12.531 --> 17:13.657
-What?"

17:16.869 --> 17:17.828
There's...

17:18.078 --> 17:21.582
But... So he's... You know,
he's dead the whole time,

17:21.790 --> 17:22.958
and I don't know.

17:24.918 --> 17:25.878
I mean, that's...

17:26.420 --> 17:29.673
If you haven't seen it,
that's a pretty big part of it, but...

17:33.343 --> 17:35.429
for those that have,
think about when you watched it.

17:35.512 --> 17:38.515
When we saw this movie for the first time,
none of us knew he was dead.

17:38.599 --> 17:42.186
That was the biggest surprise
we've ever seen in our life. You know?

17:42.269 --> 17:45.022
We just thought his wife
wasn't talking to him for, like, a year.

17:45.105 --> 17:48.484
That made more sense to us
than him possibly being dead.

17:57.409 --> 17:59.912
And when I watched it, I was like,
"What, do they show him dying?"

17:59.995 --> 18:02.039
Yeah, that guy shoots him with a gun.

18:02.122 --> 18:04.083
That's how the movie starts.
That's how obvious.

18:04.166 --> 18:05.751
They're like, "Hey, he's dead."

18:06.085 --> 18:08.337
And we still watched it for two hours,

18:08.420 --> 18:11.590
just like, "I know what this guy's
going through, you know? This is...

18:11.965 --> 18:15.302
This is a movie about marriage
and how hard marriage is. Yeah.

18:15.761 --> 18:17.763
Even if you get shot, it's your fault."

18:23.268 --> 18:26.730
On a, uh... On a sadder note, of sorts,

18:27.523 --> 18:30.275
we, uh...
We had to put our dog down recently.

18:30.651 --> 18:32.778
And, uh, it's a tough thing to do.

18:32.861 --> 18:35.030
You know? There was...
Nothing was wrong with her.

18:35.114 --> 18:37.825
I'm just really busy right now, and...

18:39.701 --> 18:41.954
She was... No, she was very sick.
That was a joke.

18:42.037 --> 18:43.288
All right? She was...

18:43.372 --> 18:45.541
That was a joke,
and she would have loved that joke,

18:45.624 --> 18:47.084
so don't you worry about it.

18:47.960 --> 18:50.337
That's the type of humor she had.
She was a rescue.

18:50.420 --> 18:52.714
It's not your labradoodle humor,
all right?

18:52.798 --> 18:53.966
It's a little darker.

18:59.054 --> 19:00.139
She, uh...

19:00.430 --> 19:02.432
She was a wonderful dog. We loved her.

19:02.516 --> 19:04.268
And, uh, her name was Annie.

19:04.643 --> 19:07.771
And the reason we got her
was my sister worked at a vet,

19:07.855 --> 19:10.023
and people do put dogs down for no reason.

19:10.107 --> 19:13.485
So, if someone brought a dog in
that was fine, they just didn't want it,

19:13.569 --> 19:15.195
uh, my sister couldn't do it.

19:15.279 --> 19:18.282
So she would walk the dog back
and then just steal the dog.

19:19.408 --> 19:22.077
Like, I don't know the laws
on all that, but...

19:22.786 --> 19:25.747
I'm sure now people are finding out
their dog is still alive right now,

19:25.831 --> 19:26.915
like, they're like...

19:28.000 --> 19:30.043
So, uh, we got Annie.

19:30.419 --> 19:31.587
Annie was getting put down.

19:31.670 --> 19:34.131
She was a hunting dog,
and she was terrible at it.

19:34.756 --> 19:36.633
And she was bred to be a hunting dog,

19:36.717 --> 19:40.554
and she was just like a misfit toy
that just couldn't, didn't do it.

19:40.637 --> 19:41.889
She got shot once,

19:42.431 --> 19:44.850
and that's 'cause the guy, like...

19:44.933 --> 19:46.768
He would be, like, doing target practice,

19:46.852 --> 19:49.313
and then she'd just walk
in front of the targets.

19:50.397 --> 19:52.608
He would hit her,
and he was like, "What are you doing?"

19:52.691 --> 19:54.443
And she was like, "What are <i>you</i> doing?"

19:58.155 --> 20:03.076
She had, uh, no awareness about her,
like the senses that dogs have.

20:03.160 --> 20:05.120
We had turkeys in our backyard once,

20:05.204 --> 20:07.331
and I let her out
to go chase these turkeys.

20:07.414 --> 20:10.125
You know, retired hunting dog.
I figured, "That's fun."

20:10.334 --> 20:13.128
And... we have a very normal backyard.

20:13.212 --> 20:16.465
It's not Yellowstone Park.
You can see all of it at all times.

20:19.009 --> 20:22.262
I, like, push her out, and she just pees
and then comes back in the house.

20:22.346 --> 20:23.931
Never sees the turkeys.

20:26.016 --> 20:28.810
I'm looking at her like, "You didn't
feel anything? Nothing was going...

20:28.894 --> 20:31.230
Like, I sensed it as a human on the couch.

20:31.313 --> 20:32.689
I felt there was turkeys outside.

20:32.773 --> 20:35.025
You wanna take just one lap around,
see if..."

20:38.111 --> 20:40.197
The guy used her a lot for duck hunting.

20:40.280 --> 20:41.823
So he would shoot a duck,

20:41.907 --> 20:44.618
she was supposed to run and go get it,
and then bring it back.

20:44.701 --> 20:46.078
So what I like to picture

20:46.411 --> 20:47.663
is he shoots the duck,

20:47.746 --> 20:48.830
she runs out,

20:49.206 --> 20:50.582
comes back, no duck.

20:50.999 --> 20:53.877
She's like, "I don't even know
what we're doing, all right? I did not...

20:53.961 --> 20:56.255
A million things flew in the air
when you shot that gun,

20:56.338 --> 20:58.507
and I'm supposed to know
which one you hit?"

20:58.924 --> 21:01.343
And the guy's just looking at her,
and then she's like,

21:01.426 --> 21:03.929
"You're not even the guy
that I came out here with. Uh...

21:06.598 --> 21:09.559
Do you see... Is there another guy
out here by any chance?"

21:13.146 --> 21:15.357
Our daughter would put
birthday cone hats on her,

21:15.440 --> 21:17.442
and one time, one slipped over her eye,

21:17.818 --> 21:19.778
and it was like that for six hours.

21:20.988 --> 21:22.447
I was just trying to see how long...

21:22.531 --> 21:24.658
Like, how's it accidentally
not coming off?

21:25.200 --> 21:27.661
And she was just going about her day.
Just eating, drinking,
like, "Yeah, I can't see
out that eye no more, all right?

21:30.831 --> 21:33.208
That's the cards I was dealt,
and that's okay."

21:34.793 --> 21:37.796
Then I pulled it off her. She was like,
"Ah, I didn't know  you were a doctor."

21:37.879 --> 21:39.214
I'm like, "I <i>am </i>a doctor."

21:40.007 --> 21:42.342
Just two dumb animals
talking to each other.

21:45.095 --> 21:47.931
So she had skin cancer,
and she would get all these spots on her.

21:48.015 --> 21:49.433
So we kept getting them removed,

21:49.516 --> 21:52.185
but it was really starting to take
a toll on her and she was older.

21:52.269 --> 21:54.104
So we knew the day was close.

21:54.187 --> 21:55.856
And our daughter, she's six now,

21:55.939 --> 21:57.357
but she was five at the time.

21:57.441 --> 22:00.527
This was her first pet.
She was best friends with this dog.

22:00.610 --> 22:03.363
Annie was the first thing
that was gonna die in her lifetime.

22:03.447 --> 22:06.742
So it's a lot of stuff to have to explain
to a kid, you know?

22:06.825 --> 22:09.619
So I was talking to my wife about like,
"How are we going to tell her?"

22:09.703 --> 22:12.706
At first, I was like, "Let's just act
like we didn't have a dog."

22:14.166 --> 22:17.544
Five-year-olds are smart,
but if we stick together on this,

22:17.961 --> 22:20.380
and she comes home from school
and is like, 'Where's the dog?"

22:20.464 --> 22:22.591
And we're like "What dog? Like, I don't...

22:23.759 --> 22:24.760
I've never seen a dog.

22:24.843 --> 22:27.304
Don't you think I would know
if there was a dog?"

22:28.930 --> 22:32.017
But I read an article
about the long-term damage of that.

22:32.100 --> 22:33.810
It's pretty good. So...

22:38.315 --> 22:40.567
I was just honest with her.
I sat her down.

22:40.650 --> 22:44.112
I said, "Look, Annie's very sick,
and she's older, and she's gonna die soon.

22:44.196 --> 22:46.740
This happens, so just love her
as much as you can right now."

22:46.823 --> 22:48.992
And she took it as good
as a five-year-old can take it.

22:49.076 --> 22:52.579
So, the next day, I told her again.
You gotta tell kids over and over again.

22:52.662 --> 22:54.915
I kept telling her.
I didn't want this to be a surprise.

22:54.998 --> 22:58.335
And then Annie surprised us
by living six months longer.

22:58.794 --> 23:02.381
I mean, we were <i>way </i>off
on when we thought she was gonna die.

23:02.839 --> 23:04.466
But I already started telling my daughter.

23:04.549 --> 23:06.885
I didn't want to stop
and then have to start it again.

23:06.968 --> 23:09.179
So I just kept it up for six months.

23:10.013 --> 23:13.058
Every day, I was like, "She'll die.
All right? She will die.

23:15.310 --> 23:16.353
She will die.

23:16.436 --> 23:18.438
I will die. Your mom's dead."

23:25.070 --> 23:25.904
So...

23:26.405 --> 23:27.406
we get...

23:27.739 --> 23:29.866
Finally, the day was here,

23:30.075 --> 23:31.785
and our daughter was at school.

23:32.035 --> 23:34.454
And so my sister and my wife,

23:34.538 --> 23:37.040
they took Annie
to go have to put her to sleep,

23:37.124 --> 23:39.126
and I went to go pick up
our daughter to tell her.

23:39.209 --> 23:40.585
I've already been telling her.

23:40.669 --> 23:43.130
And so I picked her up, I told her.

23:43.213 --> 23:44.506
It was brutal.

23:44.589 --> 23:45.757
Very sad.

23:45.841 --> 23:48.802
She took it as if this was
the first she's heard about it.

23:52.848 --> 23:55.183
We get home, and my wife was like,
"How was it?"

23:55.267 --> 23:57.769
Which is already a dumb...
Like, "It was great.

23:57.978 --> 23:59.563
-You know? I...

24:00.147 --> 24:03.358
...loved it. Can't wait
for the next thing to die. Uh...

24:04.276 --> 24:06.361
Nice to say 'I told you so,' you know."

24:08.113 --> 24:10.490
I told my wife,
"It was terrible," you know?

24:10.824 --> 24:14.202
And then my wife goes, "You didn't
tell her that I did it, did you?"

24:14.536 --> 24:16.580
I was like, "No, why would I say that?"

24:16.663 --> 24:19.249
Like, I didn't even think about it,
you know?

24:19.833 --> 24:22.002
I looked at her like,
"Is that what you would have said?

24:22.085 --> 24:24.045
Would you have told her that I did it?"

24:27.424 --> 24:29.134
"Your dad's been talking
about the dog dying.

24:29.217 --> 24:30.802
Well, he's finally had enough."

24:35.474 --> 24:37.642
We've been married, uh, 12 years,

24:37.726 --> 24:39.978
and our wedding, uh...

24:40.061 --> 24:41.229
it was not good.

24:41.605 --> 24:43.356
-There's...

24:43.857 --> 24:46.359
This is not... This is not my fault.

24:46.610 --> 24:49.654
This was... My mom and my wife
planned the wedding,

24:50.030 --> 24:51.239
and they're both cheap.

24:51.948 --> 24:53.158
So they cut corners.

24:53.241 --> 24:56.161
If we hire someone... If we hire someone
to do something to our house,

24:56.244 --> 24:58.663
I promise he does not
do that job full-time.

25:01.833 --> 25:04.503
He'll be fixing our dishwasher,
and we're like, "Do you paint houses?"

25:04.586 --> 25:07.214
He's like, "Yeah, I probably
could paint houses." You know?

25:07.631 --> 25:10.550
His business card says, "How hard
could it be? Right? Can't be that hard."

25:10.634 --> 25:11.635
-Uh...

25:14.471 --> 25:16.348
We got married on Friday the 13th.

25:16.431 --> 25:18.225
Got a pretty sweet deal on that.

25:20.977 --> 25:22.229
They were wide open.

25:23.021 --> 25:26.191
We were like, "What times are available?"
They go, "Every one of them, all 24.

25:26.274 --> 25:28.193
You can call us that day if you want."

25:30.695 --> 25:32.948
Her brother married us, that was free.

25:34.282 --> 25:36.826
The photographer was
just a buddy of ours that had like a...

25:36.910 --> 25:39.704
He just bought a new camera. So we're
like, "You gonna do our wedding?"

25:39.788 --> 25:42.249
Never done anything professionally,
and it showed.

25:42.499 --> 25:43.583
-Uh...

25:44.543 --> 25:46.545
His camera stopped working during it,

25:46.836 --> 25:50.423
and he started taking stuff out of it,
like that would be the problem, like...

25:50.507 --> 25:51.758
It's like, "Yeah, you know what?

25:51.841 --> 25:54.469
I bet they put too much stuff inside of it
when they built it.

25:54.553 --> 25:55.971
You should yank some wires.

25:56.054 --> 25:58.014
That's not supposed to be
in there like that."

25:59.432 --> 26:01.309
Our DJ was awful,

26:01.393 --> 26:03.770
and that's because we got my mom
to hire the DJ.

26:04.187 --> 26:08.483
I don't know who thinks to ask someone
in their 50s for DJ recommendations.

26:09.359 --> 26:13.238
No one ever is like, "Mom, are you in
with the local DJ scene by any chance?"

26:15.824 --> 26:17.742
She hired someone older than her.

26:18.618 --> 26:21.997
He just had CDs, and this was
when computers were doing real good.

26:28.003 --> 26:29.838
He got, uh, super drunk,

26:30.338 --> 26:33.008
played the same song three times in a row.

26:33.633 --> 26:36.052
"White Wedding,"
which he said was by Billy Joel.

26:40.390 --> 26:42.767
He only had one leg... seriously.

26:43.059 --> 26:45.979
And that's fine, you know? No one cares...

26:46.354 --> 26:47.564
until he starts messing up,

26:47.647 --> 26:49.899
and then you're like,
"Why does he have one leg?"

26:59.284 --> 27:02.329
The best wedding I've ever been to
was my cousin's wedding.

27:02.704 --> 27:04.623
It was a real redneck affair.

27:05.498 --> 27:08.752
It was right outside Louisville, Kentucky,
where my parents are from.

27:08.835 --> 27:12.756
And my cousin's name is Tuesday,
which is a good start.

27:15.550 --> 27:17.385
The invitation said,
"Tuesday's getting married,

27:17.469 --> 27:19.054
rehearsal's Friday, wedding's Saturday."

27:19.137 --> 27:21.473
People were like, "We gotta be there
Monday for this wedding?

27:21.556 --> 27:23.558
How long is this wedding? It's a week?"

27:27.354 --> 27:28.355
We get there,

27:28.438 --> 27:30.857
I'm wearing a button-down shirt,
khaki pants.

27:30.940 --> 27:33.109
Nothing crazy. I'm wildly overdressed.

27:33.652 --> 27:35.070
I look like I work there.

27:35.153 --> 27:36.071
-Uh...

27:36.738 --> 27:39.741
Everybody else just has
a football or basketball jersey on.

27:41.451 --> 27:43.370
My uncle, his daughter's getting married.

27:43.453 --> 27:46.873
He has his tuxedo jacket,
pants, cummerbund, bowtie.

27:46.956 --> 27:47.832
No shirt.

27:49.501 --> 27:52.253
They forgot his shirt,
and instead of waiting to go get it,

27:52.337 --> 27:54.756
he was like, "Let's do it without it."
Right? Like, that's...

27:56.633 --> 27:59.344
And he doesn't have a body
that's like, "That's cool, man." You know?

27:59.427 --> 28:02.597
He has a body that you're like,
"Put your jacket on backwards.

28:02.681 --> 28:04.516
Flip it around." Yeah.

28:05.892 --> 28:07.644
Then you see his back,
and you're like, "Oof.

28:07.727 --> 28:10.021
All right, go back to regular way.
Yeah, that's my fault.

28:10.105 --> 28:12.982
I didn't... How's your back worse
than your front?" Uh...

28:16.361 --> 28:18.530
We go into the church.
It's bride and groom.

28:18.613 --> 28:21.282
Looks like it's home and away
That's how many jerseys are in there.

28:21.366 --> 28:22.617
-Uh...

28:25.161 --> 28:28.873
Guys are drinking beers in the church.
Like, that's something I've never heard,

28:28.957 --> 28:32.419
a pastor be like, "Guys, can we not drink
alcohol in the church?"

28:32.836 --> 28:36.506
They're like, "Oh, I didn't know this was
the nice part of town. All right." Uh...

28:38.133 --> 28:41.553
The reception is next door,
just at a lady's house.

28:41.928 --> 28:44.097
Like, in her backyard.
Like, she doesn't do...

28:44.180 --> 28:47.100
It isn't like, she's like,
"And I do receptions all the time."

28:47.183 --> 28:49.436
We were her one and only reception.

28:50.061 --> 28:52.313
So we walk over.
They took a horse and buggy.

28:52.397 --> 28:55.233
The horse was
the oldest horse I've ever seen.

28:55.316 --> 28:57.819
I thought it was a donkey.
I thought they got a deal on a donkey.

28:57.902 --> 29:01.573
And the guy was like,
"This horse was in the Kentucky Derby."

29:01.656 --> 29:03.324
You're like, "The first one that they did?

29:03.408 --> 29:05.368
Is that Secretariat's father?

29:05.452 --> 29:06.828
How old is this horse, man?

29:07.078 --> 29:09.247
You know they lay down, right?"<i> </i>Uh...

29:13.334 --> 29:15.253
So we walk. They took... They...

29:15.378 --> 29:17.839
It took them... It took them 45 minutes.

29:17.922 --> 29:20.341
They went up a driveway
and back down the next driveway.

29:20.425 --> 29:23.219
They're sweating, almost divorced
by the time they get there.

29:24.721 --> 29:26.806
The reception, like I said,
it's in her backyard.

29:26.890 --> 29:28.892
They put plywood on the grass,

29:28.975 --> 29:31.144
like, side-by-side, to make a dance floor.

29:31.227 --> 29:34.230
We danced just to a radio station
on a boombox.

29:35.064 --> 29:37.025
Just, like, 104.5.

29:37.108 --> 29:39.569
You would have to stop
for weather and traffic updates.

29:42.697 --> 29:46.576
There was a punch bowl that was
low to the ground, like on a low table.

29:46.659 --> 29:48.995
And so I was giving it to kids.
I was trying to help out.

29:49.078 --> 29:52.707
And then someone was like, "That's wine."
And I gave it to so many kids.

29:56.127 --> 29:57.420
I don't know anything about wine,

29:57.504 --> 29:59.714
but I don't think they tell you
to pour it into a bowl.

29:59.798 --> 30:00.882
Like, that's not...

30:01.591 --> 30:04.177
No one's ever like, "Let's get it
out of that box, get it in a bowl.

30:04.260 --> 30:06.304
You know,
let's let it breathe a little bit."

30:07.680 --> 30:10.391
I got a couple of nine-year-olds
pretty loose that night.

30:14.687 --> 30:16.815
The end of the night comes,
everybody's drunk.

30:16.898 --> 30:19.192
Children, adults - it's across the board.

30:22.445 --> 30:24.697
A fight breaks out,
we hear someone yell, "Fight!'

30:24.781 --> 30:27.492
And I mean, you're sitting there,
you got a 50/50 shot

30:27.575 --> 30:29.244
it's not your side of the family.

30:30.245 --> 30:33.122
We get over there, it's 100% our side.

30:34.833 --> 30:36.793
It's my dad's aunt and uncle,

30:37.168 --> 30:39.003
both rolling around on the ground.

30:39.462 --> 30:40.547
They're in their late 70s.

30:40.630 --> 30:42.507
He wanted to leave, she did not,

30:42.841 --> 30:45.969
so they thought, "Let's just handle it
in front of everybody."

30:47.804 --> 30:48.972
She's on top of him.

30:49.055 --> 30:50.265
She punches him.
He then punches her,

30:51.641 --> 30:54.018
and you're like,
"You can't do that," you know?

30:54.227 --> 30:56.563
So we gotta get them apart,
and he starts fighting us,

30:56.646 --> 30:58.273
and he's a pretty good fighter, all right?

30:58.356 --> 30:59.899
He's punching women in public.

31:00.358 --> 31:03.194
You don't think he's handled
some dudes in his lifetime?

31:05.530 --> 31:08.825
That ends the night, you know?
You can't be like, "Guys, let's calm...

31:08.908 --> 31:11.369
Cut the radio back on,
find a good station." Uh...

31:14.122 --> 31:17.041
Tuesday, uh, is sadly divorced now.

31:17.542 --> 31:18.668
That did not work out.

31:19.752 --> 31:22.171
My dad's aunt and uncle,
sadly, they're still...

31:22.255 --> 31:24.757
It did work out.
They're still together. So...

31:26.593 --> 31:28.595
That's our family, you know? We come...

31:29.220 --> 31:30.680
It's a pretty wild bunch.

31:32.390 --> 31:34.392
My dad is a magician.

31:34.475 --> 31:36.352
He's done that my entire life.
He was a clown at the very beginning,

31:39.188 --> 31:42.483
just in case you're like, "How do you get
into something like that?" Uh...

31:44.193 --> 31:46.571
It goes clown, then magic.
There's two steps.

31:46.654 --> 31:48.364
You can take them in either order.

31:53.411 --> 31:55.038
I was born, he was a clown.

31:55.121 --> 31:56.456
It was never weird to me.

31:56.539 --> 31:58.666
I thought everybody's dad was a clown.

32:01.002 --> 32:04.005
My, uh, first memory of my life

32:04.088 --> 32:05.423
is I was five years old,

32:05.673 --> 32:09.218
and I remember
my mom walked me out to the front yard,

32:09.302 --> 32:11.971
and my dad pulled up...
We had this old red Mazda.

32:12.055 --> 32:14.974
He's dressed as a clown,
that doesn't even faze me.

32:15.058 --> 32:17.352
That's just how he left.
How else would he come home?

32:17.435 --> 32:18.269
And...

32:19.395 --> 32:21.272
The Easter Bunny was
in the passenger seat.

32:21.356 --> 32:23.942
That's the first thing
that I remember, to my life.

32:24.734 --> 32:26.694
If you want to know
how you get into comedy,

32:26.778 --> 32:28.154
that's a pretty good nudge.

32:31.449 --> 32:33.159
And I remember it didn't fit.

32:33.242 --> 32:35.203
The Easter Bunny head
didn't fit in the car.

32:35.286 --> 32:36.829
Like, he couldn't sit normal,

32:36.913 --> 32:38.831
so his head was bent to the side.

32:39.832 --> 32:41.668
And I remember he had his seat belt on,

32:41.751 --> 32:43.711
and he's just like... and I was like...

32:45.880 --> 32:48.716
I like to think about
all the other people that saw that.

32:48.800 --> 32:51.010
Just in the car next to them,
just at a red light,

32:51.094 --> 32:53.972
you're like, "I didn't even know
they hung out like that." Uh...

32:57.350 --> 32:58.434
So, me and my dad, we do...

32:58.518 --> 33:00.895
He just does magic now,
and he's very good at what he does.

33:00.979 --> 33:03.648
He's very funny, and we do shows together.

33:03.856 --> 33:05.858
So, uh, one time, we did this show.

33:05.942 --> 33:08.611
Magicians have conventions
where they get together

33:08.695 --> 33:11.072
and they buy and sell tricks,
and they give a lecture,

33:11.155 --> 33:12.490
and they do this big show.

33:12.573 --> 33:15.994
So this guy was putting one together
in Des Moines, Iowa,

33:16.077 --> 33:19.330
which is the birthplace of magic,
something a lot of people don't know.

33:19.414 --> 33:23.209
And... It's not,
but that does sound like it could be.

33:23.292 --> 33:24.335
I don't know why.

33:25.044 --> 33:26.337
I said that in Des Moines,

33:26.421 --> 33:28.881
and people are like,
"I think I already knew that." Uh...

33:28.965 --> 33:31.551
They're like, "No. Uh, yeah, he's...
No, he's right."

33:32.468 --> 33:35.304
So, this guy calls me, he's like,
"Your dad's performing this year,

33:35.388 --> 33:36.806
so we want you to come down,

33:36.889 --> 33:39.892
and we're gonna make you
appear out of a magic trick."

33:39.976 --> 33:42.478
I'm gonna come out,
I'm gonna surprise my dad,

33:42.562 --> 33:44.981
surprise the audience,
everybody will go crazy,

33:45.064 --> 33:48.359
and then I'll do five minutes of stand-up,
and that will end the show.

33:48.443 --> 33:51.904
He's like, "It's gonna be a big deal."
I was like, "All right." I agreed to it.

33:51.988 --> 33:53.072
I fly to Des Moines.

33:53.156 --> 33:56.159
I'm hiding.
I'm in my room. No one knows I'm there.

33:56.242 --> 33:57.410
The show starts.

33:57.493 --> 34:00.496
My dad's out performing,
I climb in a box backstage.

34:00.580 --> 34:02.165
When my dad gets done performing,

34:02.248 --> 34:04.876
they ask him to stay and help,
and they push the box out.

34:05.543 --> 34:08.337
The trick is, the guy has
a very pretty lady assistant.

34:08.421 --> 34:11.132
She walks around, shows the box is empty,
and then she climbs in.

34:11.215 --> 34:13.426
Normally, it just falls apart,
and then she disappears.

34:13.509 --> 34:16.095
But now, it falls apart,
and it's me, and I pop out.

34:16.179 --> 34:17.305
And you have to come out big.

34:17.388 --> 34:20.391
I don't know if you've ever appeared
out of a magic trick, but...

34:21.559 --> 34:24.437
if you do, you can't just be like,
"How you doing?"

34:24.520 --> 34:26.022
-You know? Like...

34:26.105 --> 34:28.816
It's gotta be a big grand, like,
"Can you believe it?"

34:29.400 --> 34:32.195
And I look at my dad,
his face is so surprised.

34:32.278 --> 34:33.321
He had no idea.

34:33.404 --> 34:36.240
But his eyes are just like,
"Why would you ever do this?"

34:36.783 --> 34:39.660
And I was like,
"Is this not a good time to visit you?"

34:39.744 --> 34:40.787
Uh...

34:42.997 --> 34:45.917
The audience is clapping,
but they're not going that crazy...

34:46.000 --> 34:48.628
Like, they start...
The clapping starts dying down,

34:48.711 --> 34:50.713
and as I'm standing there,
it's, like, hitting me.

34:50.797 --> 34:52.840
I was like,
"I don't think they know who we are."

34:52.924 --> 34:55.176
That guy told me they did, and they don't.

34:55.426 --> 34:57.845
They don't know that's my dad,
they don't know I'm a comedian.

34:57.929 --> 35:00.598
This looks like the stupidest trick
they've ever seen.

35:02.100 --> 35:03.184
It doesn't make sense.

35:03.267 --> 35:06.437
They're like, 'A pretty girl goes in
and just a whatever dude pops out?

35:06.521 --> 35:07.480
That's your trick?

35:08.022 --> 35:09.482
Your trick is backwards, sir.

35:09.565 --> 35:10.733
It's backwards."

35:13.820 --> 35:16.239
And now I gotta do comedy,
but they don't know I'm a comedian.

35:16.322 --> 35:19.534
So I get a microphone, they're like,
"He's gonna talk to us now?

35:19.992 --> 35:21.702
How long is this trick?"

35:24.914 --> 35:27.917
When you do comedy
in front of people not expecting comedy,

35:28.000 --> 35:29.585
it does not come off as comedy.

35:30.711 --> 35:32.588
It sounds like a mean speech.

35:32.672 --> 35:35.466
They were just like, "Get back in the box.
Where's the girl?

35:35.758 --> 35:37.510
Is she fine? Can we hear from her?"

35:43.391 --> 35:46.519
I don't think things through.
That's the message tonight, guys.

35:47.228 --> 35:49.188
There's not... There's no message.

35:51.149 --> 35:53.734
But if there was,
it's I don't think things through.

35:54.527 --> 35:57.488
No. I'm a huge, uh, Vanderbilt fan.

35:57.572 --> 36:00.116
-And... Thank you, a couple of us.

36:00.199 --> 36:02.618
Yeah, the storm is coming together.

36:02.952 --> 36:04.370
Uh...

36:04.996 --> 36:06.372
I mean, I, uh...

36:06.706 --> 36:08.124
I did not go to Vanderbilt, too.

36:08.207 --> 36:11.085
Vanderbilt asked me to say that, and...

36:13.629 --> 36:16.966
I was like, "I think people know,"
and they go, "We do too, but just say it."

36:17.049 --> 36:18.384
-Uh...

36:20.303 --> 36:23.973
Vanderbilt went to their first bowl game
in football

36:24.056 --> 36:26.434
in, like, 20 years, in 2008.

36:26.851 --> 36:29.437
And, uh, so we all go to it.
We're very excited.

36:29.520 --> 36:30.855
It's at Tennessee Titans' stadium.

36:30.938 --> 36:32.648
So, me and a bunch of buddies
get together,

36:32.732 --> 36:35.985
we go tailgate,
we get a cornhole, a grill.

36:36.068 --> 36:38.154
Like, we're going... we're going all out.

36:38.571 --> 36:40.406
And my ticket was at will-call, so I went.

36:40.489 --> 36:42.658
I was like, "I gotta get my ticket.
I'll be right back."

36:42.742 --> 36:45.703
So I go get my ticket,
and before the lady gives it to me,

36:45.786 --> 36:48.122
she ripped it,
which means you have to go in.

36:48.206 --> 36:52.293
And it was, I mean, a full three hours
before the game starts.

36:52.752 --> 36:54.670
I was like, "I don't want to go in yet,"
you know?

36:54.754 --> 36:56.505
And she was like, "You have to go."

36:57.340 --> 37:00.593
And I just walked in
to just an empty stadium.

37:01.010 --> 37:02.929
Sixty thousand empty seats.

37:03.304 --> 37:06.098
I go to my seat,
I don't go to a different one.

37:06.182 --> 37:09.268
I went to, like, the one
I'm supposed to go to, like a loser.

37:10.269 --> 37:13.356
The players are, like, in jeans.
They're not even dressed yet.

37:14.607 --> 37:16.984
I was like, "I'm real excited
for the game!" I startled them.

37:17.068 --> 37:19.904
They were like, "I didn't know
anybody was in here. Uh...

37:20.488 --> 37:23.407
Did you go to Vandy?" I was like,
"You would think with how early I'm here,

37:23.491 --> 37:25.076
-but...

37:25.159 --> 37:26.410
I also think if I went to Vandy,

37:26.494 --> 37:28.663
I wouldn't be
in the situation that I'm in."

37:30.331 --> 37:32.959
I walked to the top of the stadium
and watched my friends tailgate.

37:33.042 --> 37:34.835
I just sat up at the very top.

37:35.628 --> 37:37.213
And I was like, "I'm already in, guys.

37:37.296 --> 37:39.924
Yeah, I decided to save
our numbered seats." Uh...

37:41.842 --> 37:44.345
Nothing was open.
I stood in front of a concession stand,

37:44.428 --> 37:46.639
like I was waiting for an iPhone
to come out.

37:47.848 --> 37:49.350
Just that gate was down,

37:49.433 --> 37:51.686
and I'm already trying to figure out
what I'm gonna eat.

37:51.769 --> 37:55.898
And they came and opened it,
and one side got stuck, and I helped them.

37:55.982 --> 37:58.192
I go, "I'll get that."
So I helped them open it.

37:58.609 --> 37:59.860
They were like, "You work here?"

37:59.944 --> 38:02.655
I was like, "I've been here
a bit longer than you have, so..."

38:09.161 --> 38:10.162
I'm not smart.

38:11.330 --> 38:12.206
At all.

38:12.373 --> 38:13.291
No, I'm pretty...

38:13.791 --> 38:17.545
I, uh... I'm smart enough to, like,
answer my six-year-old's questions.

38:17.628 --> 38:18.921
She's like, "Why is the sun hot?"

38:19.005 --> 38:22.216
I'm like, "'Cause it's on fire.
That's a stupid question." And...

38:23.592 --> 38:25.136
I tell her that, all right,

38:25.219 --> 38:27.638
because I know that she'll be smarter
than me next year,

38:27.722 --> 38:29.265
and then just for the rest of her life.

38:29.348 --> 38:31.726
So I am really sticking it to her
while I can.

38:35.479 --> 38:39.400
I know nothing about, like, adult stuff
that you're supposed to know about.

38:39.734 --> 38:43.279
Uh, global warming, that's one
that everybody yells at you about.

38:43.362 --> 38:46.073
They're like, "You better do something."
I'm like, "I'm so tired of it.

38:46.157 --> 38:47.783
Let's do it." Like...

38:48.451 --> 38:50.369
I'm like, "I barely made it
out of high school.

38:50.453 --> 38:52.121
I don't really know how rain works.

38:52.204 --> 38:55.333
So why don't...
why don't you let me figure that out,

38:55.416 --> 38:56.834
and then I'll do global warming.

38:56.917 --> 39:00.629
But I've seen it rain without clouds.
Where's that water coming from? So...

39:00.713 --> 39:03.007
I'm pretty swamped
with this rain stuff right now,

39:03.090 --> 39:05.718
but once I get to the bottom of that,

39:05.801 --> 39:07.303
then we'll do global warming,

39:07.386 --> 39:09.472
and I got some pretty good ideas,
you know?"

39:14.060 --> 39:15.394
We recycle, you know,

39:15.478 --> 39:17.855
and we recycle because my wife,
it's her...

39:17.938 --> 39:19.607
She gets all the credit for that.

39:19.690 --> 39:21.859
I would never recycle if I was by my...

39:21.942 --> 39:24.445
I don't... I don't do it
if she's not looking at me,

39:24.737 --> 39:28.157
so I would never do it if I was alone.

39:29.575 --> 39:31.786
I looked up a list of, like,

39:31.869 --> 39:34.997
"All right, what are you supposed to do
for global warming, as an individual?"

39:35.456 --> 39:37.458
And it was a big, long list,

39:37.541 --> 39:39.377
but the first thing on the list
was my favorite.

39:39.460 --> 39:42.213
It just said, "Just talk to your friends
and family about it."

39:44.215 --> 39:45.674
Think about your friends and family.

39:45.758 --> 39:48.803
Like, not the ones that are
the good ones, that are close.

39:48.886 --> 39:50.012
Think about how...

39:50.513 --> 39:51.722
far out it goes.

39:52.264 --> 39:55.267
When you guys get together, be like,
"You mind if we talk about global warming?

39:55.351 --> 39:58.229
I just thought this would be
a good time to get into it."

39:59.397 --> 40:02.608
I had a great aunt and uncle
fist fight each other at a wedding.

40:03.317 --> 40:04.443
"Let me get in the middle.

40:04.527 --> 40:06.362
Any chance this fight
was about global warming?

40:06.445 --> 40:10.241
Because I just would love to get
that conversation rolling, you know?"

40:13.577 --> 40:15.913
I get it. We're supposed to...
It's supposed to...

40:15.996 --> 40:17.873
It's for our kids' kids, and their kids,

40:17.957 --> 40:20.042
and we wanna make sure
they have a good Earth,

40:20.126 --> 40:23.587
and their environment and stuff.
We don't want 'em to have a bad Earth.

40:23.838 --> 40:26.674
And we don't want them
to be mad at us, and yell at us,

40:26.757 --> 40:29.135
but I don't think they will,
because I don't think we get mad.

40:29.218 --> 40:32.054
I don't ever see litter on the ground
and call my grandmother,

40:32.138 --> 40:34.014
and be like, "Where do you get off,"
you know?

40:35.182 --> 40:37.935
"I don't know how you show your face
anymore, all right?

40:38.227 --> 40:41.188
It's cloudy today. Is that because
you smoked on planes? Probably.

40:41.272 --> 40:42.773
Why'd you have to smoke that high?

40:43.774 --> 40:45.609
Where do you think that smoke was going?"

40:50.698 --> 40:53.951
We did stuff as a kid.
I did Earth Day as a kid.

40:54.034 --> 40:55.453
I think they still do Earth Day.

40:55.536 --> 40:57.246
And we did it.

40:57.621 --> 40:59.915
I'm from Old Hickory, and we're a plant...

40:59.999 --> 41:01.959
Like, DuPont Plant is the...

41:02.251 --> 41:03.502
We were a plant town.

41:03.794 --> 41:05.171
So, they had a plant,

41:05.421 --> 41:09.341
and we went and planted trees
in front of the DuPont Plant,

41:09.425 --> 41:12.303
and there was just black smoke
coming out of this thing.

41:12.803 --> 41:15.598
And we're just in front of it,
like, "This is for Earth."

41:15.681 --> 41:18.058
And you can't even see us, it's so dark.

41:18.476 --> 41:21.228
And we're just like...
"This is for the Earth and stuff,

41:21.312 --> 41:22.563
and we're gonna breathe better."

41:22.646 --> 41:26.066
And you're like, "I don't know
if that's the problem." Uh...

41:30.362 --> 41:31.363
I, uh...

41:32.156 --> 41:34.074
Here's what I'm doing

41:34.158 --> 41:37.495
for, you know,
my daughter's future environment,

41:37.912 --> 41:39.413
is, uh, what I decided to do--

41:39.497 --> 41:41.457
They... They say we won't have water.

41:41.707 --> 41:45.044
So, I put a bunch of buckets outside
to collect water,

41:45.544 --> 41:48.088
and when she turns 18,
and she's like, "Do I get money?"

41:48.172 --> 41:51.050
I'm like, "Something a little better
than money. Uh...

41:52.551 --> 41:55.095
I bet you've always wondered
what those buckets were doing outside.

41:55.179 --> 41:56.597
Well, they're all yours.

41:56.680 --> 41:58.766
And that's for your kids, and their kids.

41:58.849 --> 42:00.559
Everybody gets a bucket of water."

42:06.857 --> 42:07.691
No.

42:07.775 --> 42:10.110
Look, guys. All seriousness, though...

42:10.486 --> 42:12.029
global warming, we gotta...

42:12.112 --> 42:13.489
you know, we gotta stop it.

42:14.073 --> 42:16.033
Or... more of it.

42:16.116 --> 42:18.702
I don't really know which way
we want to go, but...

42:19.036 --> 42:21.205
It can't stay warmer. I know that.

42:21.288 --> 42:24.583
It's gotta be one or... You know,
something's gotta happen.

42:24.667 --> 42:26.544
Something. Can't stay where we're at.

42:26.919 --> 42:29.880
So, go... I don't know
what direction you want me...

42:30.130 --> 42:30.965
Just go.

42:34.635 --> 42:37.763
Look, in all...
Guys, in all seriousness, as...

42:39.974 --> 42:43.060
To use this as a platform
for global warming, guys,

42:44.311 --> 42:48.023
I felt like, you know,
I was a spokesperson for all of Earth.

42:48.107 --> 42:49.525
All right? I think...

42:51.277 --> 42:53.737
I'll give you a message
that I don't think no one will give you,

42:53.821 --> 42:55.990
and I'm here to say that we're doing fine.

42:56.073 --> 42:58.784
So just relax.

42:59.577 --> 43:02.830
You know, we're in a time where everybody
yells  at you, and everybody's bad.

43:02.913 --> 43:04.456
We're doing great. All right?

43:04.915 --> 43:07.334
I did some... I looked up,
I did some research.

43:07.418 --> 43:09.878
And I was like,
"Let me look at the other planets.

43:09.962 --> 43:12.423
Let's see how good they're doing." And...

43:13.132 --> 43:15.134
I don't want to...
I mean, it's unbelievable.

43:15.217 --> 43:17.469
They're nowhere right now. Uh...

43:17.845 --> 43:20.514
Some of them have too many moons.
That's how stupid they are.

43:20.598 --> 43:23.517
And... So let's calm down. All right?

43:23.601 --> 43:25.519
We're doing so...
We're so much farther ahead.

43:25.603 --> 43:28.230
I mean, they haven't started,
and we're almost done.

43:28.314 --> 43:29.815
-So let's...

43:29.898 --> 43:32.109
celebrate being first!

43:32.192 --> 43:33.527
Don't be sore winners.

43:42.077 --> 43:43.621
Look, in all...

43:43.704 --> 43:45.080
Guys, in all seriousness...

43:46.707 --> 43:47.666
I don't know.

43:49.835 --> 43:52.963
No, look, the world, we're...
It's getting very advanced.

43:53.047 --> 43:53.881
All right?

43:54.214 --> 43:56.967
I have, uh...
I've been to a dog bakery.

43:57.051 --> 43:58.969
I've been to a dog bakery in my life.

44:01.221 --> 44:03.682
And this wasn't in, you know,
Beverly Hills,

44:03.766 --> 44:04.975
or, like, Miami or something.

44:05.059 --> 44:06.685
You feel like they would have that.

44:06.769 --> 44:09.063
And this was in Mt. Juliet, Tennessee.

44:10.564 --> 44:13.484
And if you don't know
where Mt. Juliet is, it's fine,

44:13.567 --> 44:16.862
but I bet you can tell that doesn't sound
like a town you would drive through,

44:16.945 --> 44:19.948
going, "I bet they have
a pretty good dog bakery here."<i> </i>Uh...

44:22.576 --> 44:24.662
I went in there, and no one was in there.

44:24.745 --> 44:27.790
The lady was looking at me like,
"Are you here to buy this store from me?"

44:27.873 --> 44:29.166
That was her only hope.

44:35.756 --> 44:38.509
I talked to her,
she had some time on her hands,

44:38.592 --> 44:39.677
excited to talk.

44:39.927 --> 44:43.180
And, uh, she said her and her husband
bought the store

44:43.263 --> 44:45.140
for their 27-year-old daughter

44:45.224 --> 44:47.810
who graduated from college with a degree,

44:48.227 --> 44:51.522
and came out of college,
and said, "I want to own a dog bakery.

44:51.897 --> 44:53.482
I want to make cakes for dogs."

44:53.899 --> 44:57.945
Which, if I asked my six-year-old
what she wants to do when she grows up,

44:58.696 --> 45:01.448
I think she'll tell me
she wants to make cakes for dogs.

45:02.157 --> 45:04.743
And I'm gonna tell her
that she can do whatever she wants to do,

45:04.827 --> 45:07.079
hoping she doesn't turn 27...

45:08.205 --> 45:11.083
and go, "Let's talk about
those cakes for those dogs."

45:15.587 --> 45:16.714
Maybe they're usually busy.

45:16.797 --> 45:19.383
Maybe I was in there
on a slow dog birthday day.

45:19.466 --> 45:20.718
I don't know. All right?

45:21.552 --> 45:23.220
She told me everything was organic,

45:23.303 --> 45:26.181
and I was like, "That's good.
That's what I like to hear. All right?

45:26.265 --> 45:29.852
This is for that dog that's outside
licking gum off the sidewalk right now.

45:29.935 --> 45:33.772
And if anybody deserves organic food
in our house...

45:33.856 --> 45:36.483
it's not this little girl,
not gonna waste it on her.

45:37.484 --> 45:39.778
It's for that dog
that's wandered out on the highway,

45:39.862 --> 45:41.864
'cause it doesn't know what cars are."

45:49.747 --> 45:53.709
But, look, next time you guys
go to Mt. Juliet for a vacation,

45:53.792 --> 45:55.544
let me tell you, look, do...

45:56.086 --> 45:58.547
do 'em a favor, go by there, all right?

45:58.630 --> 46:01.341
Swing through, you know,
buy some dog cakes.

46:01.884 --> 46:05.137
Uh, and I'll be honest with you.
I'll be upfront with you, guys.

46:05.220 --> 46:08.474
I bought a dog bakery.
It's not going that good. All right? I...

46:10.267 --> 46:13.228
All right, we're almost done,
so don't worry about it. Uh...

46:16.565 --> 46:17.941
And I think you can tell...

46:18.358 --> 46:20.944
I always think people are like,
"He's talking about dog bakeries.

46:21.028 --> 46:22.654
He's about out of stuff." Uh...

46:22.738 --> 46:25.282
Yeah, where were we? Where is this going?

46:28.827 --> 46:30.871
I, uh... uh...

46:30.954 --> 46:31.914
First, thank you.

46:31.997 --> 46:33.957
I can't thank you enough
for coming out tonight.

46:34.041 --> 46:35.918
It means the world, and, uh...

46:36.210 --> 46:38.796
I've been making... This is how
I've been closing shows on the road,

46:38.879 --> 46:41.006
and I want to close
my special with it. Uh...

46:41.089 --> 46:44.718
I'm assuming that people saw the Netflix,
<i>The Standups,</i> the little half-hour...

46:44.802 --> 46:46.386
-...that I did.

46:47.763 --> 46:48.597
Thank you.

46:50.140 --> 46:52.643
Thank you for watching it.
Thank you for coming out.

46:52.726 --> 46:56.104
Uh, so some stuff's happened
since that special,

46:56.188 --> 46:59.608
and I want to give you some updates
to a couple of stories I told

47:00.025 --> 47:01.151
on that special.

47:01.819 --> 47:04.112
And if you haven't seen it,
I'll walk you through it.

47:04.196 --> 47:06.323
Don't, you know,
think you're gonna be lost,

47:06.406 --> 47:08.283
and I think you've seen
what I've talked about.

47:08.367 --> 47:10.285
I bet you're like,
"I bet we'll catch up quick."

47:10.369 --> 47:11.453
So, just...

47:14.748 --> 47:18.418
So the first update is about
the Cape Fear Serpentarium.

47:21.046 --> 47:21.880
And...

47:23.090 --> 47:24.842
if you... if you haven't seen it,

47:24.925 --> 47:27.594
you could... you could pause it right now
and go watch it,

47:27.678 --> 47:30.806
but you might be like,
"I can't handle really much more of you."

47:30.889 --> 47:31.723
But...

47:32.933 --> 47:35.477
If not, I'm gonna
walk you through it. Uh...

47:35.853 --> 47:39.606
Or maybe just a reminder.
But a very quick, unfunny version

47:39.690 --> 47:41.984
is I went to Wilmington, North Carolina

47:42.276 --> 47:43.485
to a guy's house,

47:43.694 --> 47:46.238
and he had a bunch of snakes, lizards,
and a crocodile.

47:46.321 --> 47:48.240
When I was there, a crocodile got out

47:48.323 --> 47:50.659
and a lady wrote
a TripAdvisor review about it.

47:50.951 --> 47:53.245
That's the very quick, unfunny version.

47:53.328 --> 47:56.415
If you haven't seen it, don't think that's
all it takes to get a Netflix special.

47:56.498 --> 47:57.416
Uh...

47:59.418 --> 48:01.003
So the first thing is

48:01.086 --> 48:05.173
the lady that wrote the TripAdvisor review
messaged me after the special came out.

48:05.591 --> 48:09.344
And if you write a review on TripAdvisor,
you can see how many people look at it,

48:09.428 --> 48:12.514
and it jumped 50,000 views
the day the special came out.

48:13.599 --> 48:17.185
So... But she did not know this
for a couple of days,

48:17.269 --> 48:20.647
so, I mean, she was like,
"I'm crushing it as a reviewer. All right?

48:20.856 --> 48:22.107
-I swear...

48:22.733 --> 48:24.234
You better... I'll bring your place...

48:24.318 --> 48:27.821
You better treat me right, Applebee's.
I'll bring this whole place down!"

48:35.579 --> 48:38.498
The next update to it is the, uh...

48:38.832 --> 48:41.585
So that... So Cape Fear Serpentarium
has closed down.

48:41.668 --> 48:42.711
- Aww.
-And...

48:42.794 --> 48:45.714
I know, you guys had a chance to go to it.

48:46.548 --> 48:48.175
Uh, it is closed.

48:48.258 --> 48:51.261
So the guy that owned it,
his name is Dean Ripa.

48:51.511 --> 48:53.805
I do not know this guy.
He was there that day.

48:53.889 --> 48:56.058
Uh, I saw him that day. I don't know him.

48:56.141 --> 48:59.019
I mean, this place will be
a part of my life for the rest of my life,

48:59.102 --> 49:00.520
and I was there for one day.

49:00.771 --> 49:04.608
But... So he was a very original guy,
he was his own guy.

49:04.691 --> 49:08.612
And, uh, there's... You can see
there's great stuff on him.

49:08.695 --> 49:11.281
There's another thing on Netflix
called <i>72 Deadliest Animals,</i>

49:11.365 --> 49:12.824
they interview him in that.

49:12.908 --> 49:14.701
There's also great YouTube clips

49:14.785 --> 49:17.079
where, like, he would bring,
like, venomous snakes

49:17.162 --> 49:18.914
to local Wilmington news channels,

49:18.997 --> 49:21.708
and he would barely pay attention
to these snakes.

49:21.792 --> 49:24.920
He would, like, have it on the table
and he's not even looking.

49:25.003 --> 49:26.713
They're like,
"Could you grab it maybe more?"

49:26.797 --> 49:27.965
And he's like, "What's that?"

49:28.048 --> 49:30.467
They're like, "We didn't ask you
to bring that in, by the way."

49:30.550 --> 49:33.512
And he's going, "You need me to leave it
in the car? What'd you want me..."

49:35.263 --> 49:36.932
I remember when I was there that day.

49:37.015 --> 49:39.601
There was cages empty. You're like,
"Is that supposed to be empty?"

49:39.685 --> 49:40.936
He's like, "We're cleaning that.

49:41.019 --> 49:43.230
If you see something, tell us,
but I'm pretty sure...

49:43.313 --> 49:45.065
I'm pretty sure we're cleaning that one."

49:47.567 --> 49:50.612
So the main reason it closed is, uh...

49:50.696 --> 49:53.615
sadly to announce, that guy,
he has, uh, died.

49:53.782 --> 49:55.200
Uh, he passed away.

49:55.492 --> 49:58.620
And it's pretty... pretty wild stuff.

49:59.162 --> 49:59.997
Uh...

50:00.080 --> 50:03.041
So, how he died,
a little different than most.

50:03.709 --> 50:06.003
And... I will just tell you, uh...

50:06.086 --> 50:08.588
You know, and I already know
what you're thinking in your head,

50:08.672 --> 50:10.549
and his wife shot him.

50:10.757 --> 50:14.219
So, yeah, you weren't thinking that,
I can tell you that.

50:15.762 --> 50:17.180
It's unbelievable. I mean...

50:17.597 --> 50:21.018
The odds of this are definitely higher
than if you don't own a snake museum,

50:21.101 --> 50:22.477
but there's still...

50:26.940 --> 50:28.525
It's insane. So...

50:28.608 --> 50:31.528
This all happened after we taped
that last <i>The Standups,</i>

50:31.611 --> 50:33.613
and so, uh, I would let...

50:33.697 --> 50:36.491
I was telling an audience to guess,
like, how he died.

50:36.992 --> 50:39.703
And so I'm just gonna tell you the guesses
where people, you know,

50:39.786 --> 50:43.540
"A snake got him," good guess.
"Crocodile ate him," solid guess.

50:43.623 --> 50:46.209
Someone yelled "cancer" once,
and I was like, "What?"

50:46.293 --> 50:47.335
Like, I don't...

50:47.419 --> 50:51.131
I don't know if I'd present it like this
if I knew the answer was "cancer."

50:51.965 --> 50:54.509
"Let's go around the room, everybody.
Guess how he died.

50:54.593 --> 50:55.844
Cancer? That guy got it.

50:55.927 --> 50:57.596
That was a good guess." You know?

51:01.767 --> 51:04.644
One guy guessed it once,
in Huntsville, Alabama.

51:05.270 --> 51:07.064
And it was an older gentleman,

51:07.147 --> 51:08.356
he was sitting up front,

51:08.648 --> 51:11.151
and, uh, he just goes,
"Did his wife shoot him?

51:11.234 --> 51:14.488
You know when someone guesses your guess,
and you're like, "You're the worst, man."

51:17.282 --> 51:18.700
I was like, "Did you look it up?"

51:18.784 --> 51:21.036
And he had a flip phone on his table.

51:21.119 --> 51:22.537
He wasn't looking stuff up.

51:25.791 --> 51:27.876
And I was like,
"Why would you ever guess that?"

51:27.959 --> 51:29.836
He was like, "Because my wife shot me."

51:29.920 --> 51:32.547
And I was like, "Oof. Well, that's fair."

51:34.049 --> 51:35.926
I bet he guesses that
with every death he hears,

51:36.009 --> 51:38.428
like, I mean, just, "Frank died."
"Did his wife shoot him?"

51:38.512 --> 51:42.349
"No, and I'm not gonna tell you anymore
if you keep guessing that, all right?

51:42.432 --> 51:43.600
That's the last one."

51:51.358 --> 51:52.526
The final update.

51:53.110 --> 51:54.194
That's what this next...

51:54.277 --> 51:57.739
The special after this is gonna be
just more... just all updates.

51:57.823 --> 52:01.827
And... it'll be something you don't know,
like, "Remember when my car didn't start?"

52:01.910 --> 52:04.287
You're like, "I don't...
Who is this update for? Uh..."

52:08.291 --> 52:09.876
I like to, uh...

52:09.960 --> 52:12.003
I like to drink iced coffee with milk,

52:12.587 --> 52:13.505
and...

52:15.006 --> 52:15.841
Thank you.

52:16.883 --> 52:18.176
Uh, I told a story.

52:18.260 --> 52:20.762
I went into a Starbucks inside a Target.

52:21.513 --> 52:23.849
I ordered, uh, iced coffee with milk,

52:23.932 --> 52:26.017
and the guy gave me milk with ice in it.

52:27.227 --> 52:28.854
I did not want milk with ice.

52:28.937 --> 52:32.357
I wanted iced coffee with milk,
and he heard milk with ice.

52:33.942 --> 52:36.862
I have learned that a lot of people
do drink milk with ice.

52:36.945 --> 52:39.156
People send me pictures all the time...

52:39.823 --> 52:42.951
of adults just drinking milk with ice.

52:43.034 --> 52:44.661
And they stay in the Starbucks.

52:44.744 --> 52:47.622
They don't even, like, run to their car,
like, "This is so embarrassing.

52:47.706 --> 52:49.416
I gotta stop..." Like, they...

52:49.499 --> 52:51.668
-...do it openly.

52:53.837 --> 52:57.257
My wife puts, uh, ice
in our daughter's milk,

52:57.340 --> 52:59.718
and I was like,
"Oh, you do that because of my joke?"

52:59.801 --> 53:01.636
And she's...
she's not a big fan of my comedy,

53:01.720 --> 53:04.598
so she was like, "I haven't seen it."

53:04.681 --> 53:06.224
I was like, "We have Netflix, you know."

53:06.308 --> 53:08.768
She was like, "I don't think we do,"
I was like, "I know we do."

53:08.852 --> 53:11.396
And she was like,
"I'm just so busy right now."

53:11.479 --> 53:12.397
Uh...

53:16.985 --> 53:19.029
So, all of it's true,

53:19.112 --> 53:21.406
except my wife,
my wife does like my comedy.

53:21.489 --> 53:23.408
She's very nice to me, but, uh...

53:24.284 --> 53:25.619
All the rest is true.

53:25.702 --> 53:27.162
And the truth of it, too,

53:27.245 --> 53:28.997
is it's happened to me two times.

53:29.456 --> 53:32.918
Twice, and let me tell you,
one time is a lot of times.

53:35.754 --> 53:38.215
The second time,
you start looking at yourself.

53:38.298 --> 53:42.010
You start thinking, "What am I doing?
I don't know if I know how to order."

53:43.261 --> 53:45.555
I would say... I looked at...
I ordered it in a mirror,

53:45.639 --> 53:48.058
just to see what it looked like.
Like, "Iced coffee with milk."

53:48.141 --> 53:50.227
I was just trying to see
what they would see.

53:54.064 --> 53:55.190
I thought it was happening...

53:55.273 --> 53:57.400
There was a third time
I thought it was happening.

53:57.484 --> 53:59.653
I was at a Starbucks at an airport,

53:59.986 --> 54:02.030
and she put the drink down,

54:02.113 --> 54:03.782
I was like,
"They're doing this on purpose."

54:03.865 --> 54:06.576
I was convinced
that they're just calling each other,

54:06.660 --> 54:08.453
like, "Let's drive this guy crazy."

54:10.038 --> 54:12.415
But she just put too much,
uh, milk into it.

54:12.499 --> 54:13.833
It was an honest mistake.

54:13.917 --> 54:15.543
And she told me,

54:15.627 --> 54:17.295
'cause she set the drink down,

54:17.504 --> 54:19.214
and we're both just staring at it.

54:22.384 --> 54:23.426
And she just goes...

54:24.761 --> 54:26.930
"That feels like a lot of milk,
doesn't it?"

54:33.728 --> 54:37.232
I was like, "Not as much as usual,
but it does feel..."

54:43.405 --> 54:45.198
So, I have, uh...
I've changed my drink up...

54:47.701 --> 54:51.371
since then, and I honestly did it
because I don't think I say "milk" good.

54:51.454 --> 54:54.916
I was having this one problem,
and I was like, "I'm not gonna say milk."

54:55.000 --> 54:58.461
So, now I drink iced coffee with cream.
That's all I changed it to.

54:58.545 --> 55:01.172
I'm tired of saying milk.
All they kept giving me was milk with ice.

55:01.256 --> 55:03.675
I was like, "I'm gonna say cream,
they can't do cream with ice.

55:03.758 --> 55:05.593
That's against the law." So...

55:06.845 --> 55:09.389
I'll get rid of the one problem
that I have.

55:09.931 --> 55:12.934
And I've only been drinking coffee
for maybe four years.

55:13.018 --> 55:15.020
Not very long.
I only order this one little drink.

55:15.103 --> 55:17.856
I get very nervous when I order coffee,
'cause it's a whole world,

55:17.939 --> 55:19.691
and I don't know the world, you know.

55:19.774 --> 55:21.234
They always ask you a bunch of stuff.

55:21.318 --> 55:24.070
They're like, "What kind of cream?
I'm like, "Just please do it.

55:24.154 --> 55:26.364
-Just do it." You know?

55:26.448 --> 55:28.533
Sometimes they're like,
"Heavy cream or half-and-half?"

55:28.616 --> 55:31.411
I'll go, "I'm sorry, I'm not taking
questions right now, so...

55:31.494 --> 55:35.165
if you could just do
whatever you think it is,

55:35.498 --> 55:38.710
and if it's wrong, I won't even tell you.
How about that?

55:38.793 --> 55:42.255
I will walk out of here
as if that's exactly what I ordered.

55:42.589 --> 55:45.175
I will go outside, I will throw it away,

55:45.383 --> 55:47.177
and go try again
at a different Starbucks."

55:47.260 --> 55:50.430
That's how I'll handle the entire...
That's why they have so many Starbucks,

55:50.513 --> 55:51.890
so you can just keep going.

55:51.973 --> 55:53.808
-Someone's got to get it.

55:56.519 --> 55:59.814
If I have to get my wife's coffee,
she has to text me what she wants,

55:59.898 --> 56:02.692
'cause I don't know how to pronounce,
like, most of the words there.

56:02.776 --> 56:05.487
So I just show them the phone.
I go, "She wants this."

56:05.570 --> 56:07.197
They're like,
"Does she want it sweetened?"

56:07.280 --> 56:10.200
I'm like, "Guess we have to call her now,
don't we?" And...

56:11.242 --> 56:13.453
I make them talk to her.
I go, "Talk to a stranger's wife.

56:13.536 --> 56:14.788
Say what you said to me."

56:18.583 --> 56:20.752
Have you ever been to a Starbucks,
like, inside?

56:20.835 --> 56:23.046
Like, you go inside,
and there's, like, a big, long line,

56:23.129 --> 56:25.215
and you'll be waiting,
and they try to take your order

56:25.298 --> 56:26.758
before you're even to the front.

56:26.841 --> 56:28.885
You'll be in the back,
They're like," What you want?"

56:28.968 --> 56:31.805
You're like, "I would like to wait
till I get right in front of you.

56:32.097 --> 56:34.557
Yeah, you see how everybody looked at me
when you said that?

56:34.641 --> 56:36.267
I didn't care for that, so...

56:37.435 --> 56:40.772
How about we do it like a regular,
normal business, you know,

56:40.855 --> 56:42.982
and you let me do it
right in front of you?

56:43.358 --> 56:46.236
Starbucks is, like,
waving cars down on the street,

56:46.653 --> 56:48.571
like, "We're trying to get
your order started

56:48.655 --> 56:50.740
in case you ever come here one day." Uh...

56:56.413 --> 56:59.374
So I was in, uh, San Francisco,

56:59.457 --> 57:02.293
and I bet there's a bunch
of fun coffee places,

57:02.585 --> 57:06.589
and I live in my dumb world that just...
I just want this one little drink.

57:07.298 --> 57:09.717
So I go into a Starbucks,

57:09.926 --> 57:13.471
and I get in the front, and I was like,
"Uh, I'll take an iced coffee with cream."

57:13.555 --> 57:15.181
She goes, "With cream?"
I go, "With cream."

57:15.265 --> 57:17.809
She goes, "Iced coffee with cream?"
I go, "Iced coffee with cream."

57:17.892 --> 57:19.644
She goes, "With cream?"
I go, "With cream."

57:19.727 --> 57:22.147
And she said it one more time,
"So, iced coffee with cream?"

57:22.230 --> 57:25.233
And that point I should have said,
"What's going on right now?

57:30.363 --> 57:31.739
Where are you at in your head?

57:31.823 --> 57:34.534
Because I... I feel like
we're in two different places."

57:36.786 --> 57:38.872
But I was nervous,
and there was people behind me,

57:38.955 --> 57:40.707
and I was like,
"Cream or no cream, honestly.

57:40.790 --> 57:43.418
I'll give you $20
if you let me leave right now.

57:43.501 --> 57:45.879
I cannot...
This is the most I can talk about this.

57:45.962 --> 57:48.214
I don't even know
what's happening anymore."

57:51.301 --> 57:53.761
So I paid, I go stand in line,

57:53.845 --> 57:55.346
where you gotta wait for your drink.

57:55.763 --> 57:57.932
There's, like, five of us
waiting  for our drinks.

57:58.016 --> 58:00.101
So she puts the iced coffee
up there first.

58:00.185 --> 58:02.061
No cream, and I was like, "Whatever."

58:02.937 --> 58:04.522
I'll just do it myself, you know?

58:04.606 --> 58:06.107
Like, I don't like doing it myself,

58:06.191 --> 58:07.901
but I was like,
"All right, I'll just do it."

58:07.984 --> 58:09.402
So, before I could get it,

58:09.486 --> 58:12.906
she's walked back with a can
of whipped cream, and she's shaking it.

58:13.531 --> 58:16.159
And I'm just looking at it,
like, thinking that's someone else's.

58:16.242 --> 58:19.037
I'm like, "Someone's getting
whipped cream. That's fun.

58:19.120 --> 58:21.456
One of you guys
are getting  whipped cream?"

58:21.539 --> 58:22.957
And I look down,

58:23.041 --> 58:26.586
and she starts spraying the whipped cream
on top of my iced coffee.

58:26.920 --> 58:30.298
She just yells out, "Iced coffee,
whipped cream!" Yells it out.

58:31.299 --> 58:33.635
The other four people,
they turn their back.

58:33.718 --> 58:36.638
Like, they don't want you to accidentally
think that's what they ordered.

58:37.639 --> 58:38.932
And I'm just left alone.

58:39.015 --> 58:41.518
Like, "That's what you thought
I said over there?

58:41.601 --> 58:44.229
You don't think I would have said
'iced coffee <i>with</i> whipped cream'?

58:44.312 --> 58:46.105
You think I'm just some nut job?"

58:46.564 --> 58:48.816
Like, "I've had too many problems
in this Starbucks,

58:48.900 --> 58:51.986
so I'm gonna use the words that I want
and no other words:

58:52.779 --> 58:54.447
Iced coffee, whipped cream, cup."

58:55.782 --> 58:57.367
And they didn't have a top for it.

58:57.450 --> 59:01.287
So whipped cream, it doesn't sink
and become less embarrassing. It moves.

59:01.371 --> 59:04.249
It's like a buoy in an ocean
that everybody sees.

59:04.332 --> 59:06.751
I'm walking through the crowd like,
"This is my favorite drink.

59:06.834 --> 59:08.545
I don't know
if you guys drink this at all.

59:08.628 --> 59:11.130
Does anybody...
Nobody does this? I'm surprised."

59:11.214 --> 59:14.801
And I walked outside and threw it away
and tried again at a different Starbucks.

59:14.884 --> 59:16.719
-All right. Thank you, guys.

59:16.803 --> 59:19.430
I can't thank you enough.
You are unbelievable.

59:22.100 --> 59:23.810
Thank you so much for coming out.

59:25.812 --> 59:28.147
You were, uh, really, you're awesome.
