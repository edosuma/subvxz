00:15.040 --> 00:19.440
Special treat for you, Opal. There's a nice dinner

00:15.040 --> 00:19.440
for you today.

00:19.480 --> 00:21.720
I think our luck might be changing.

00:26.160 --> 00:28.280
MAN ON TV: "Hello, everyone, and welcome back.

00:28.320 --> 00:32.040
"Of course, the main story here on Saint-Marie

00:28.320 --> 00:32.040
is that it is hot.

00:32.080 --> 00:33.880
"We are currently at 95 degrees,

00:33.920 --> 00:37.160
"and it looks like that temperature might rise

00:33.920 --> 00:37.160
over the next few hours.

00:37.200 --> 00:40.080
"So please make sure you stay out of direct..."

00:55.840 --> 00:58.080
Mm!

00:58.120 --> 01:00.760
How do you stand it, eh?

01:00.800 --> 01:05.120
Sunshine, palm trees, beach bodies...

01:05.160 --> 01:07.240
Every day must be pure hell.

01:08.080 --> 01:10.000
-Only hotter. -Hm.

01:10.040 --> 01:11.520
How long are you here for?

01:11.560 --> 01:14.920
A fortnight. Got here a couple of days ago.

01:14.960 --> 01:18.280
I don't suppose you fancy showing me the sights?

01:18.320 --> 01:21.000
I'm not sure what your wife would have to say about that.

01:21.040 --> 01:23.520
-Hm...

01:23.560 --> 01:24.720
Ah.

01:24.760 --> 01:27.320
Well, I won't tell her if you don't.

01:27.360 --> 01:29.520
Maybe another beer will do for now?

01:29.560 --> 01:33.720
Keep it cool for me, will you, love? Just going to

01:29.560 --> 01:33.720
nip out for some fags.

01:34.880 --> 01:36.280
Try not to miss me.

01:39.640 --> 01:42.240
<i>Your affinities</i> <i>will be closely entwined.</i>

01:42.280 --> 01:44.760
<i></i>

01:44.800 --> 01:46.960
<i>I see a picture forming.</i>

01:47.000 --> 01:50.400
<i>All around you</i> <i>are strange-looking objects,</i>

01:50.440 --> 01:52.920
<i>white and shining.</i>

01:52.960 --> 01:56.640
<i>I see a marriage,</i>

01:56.680 --> 02:00.280
<i>and one, two, three,</i> <i>14 children!</i>

02:01.480 --> 02:03.320
"Don't be disgusting!"

<i></i> <i>-Not 'alf! Let me get these</i>

02:24.760 --> 02:27.200

03:05.400 --> 03:07.800
-Thank you. Cheese-head screwdriver, please.

03:05.400 --> 03:07.800
-Uh-huh.

03:07.840 --> 03:08.960
Thank you.

03:13.120 --> 03:15.920
-Yes! Yes, yes.

03:15.960 --> 03:18.280
It's obviously just a, you know, loose connection.

03:18.320 --> 03:19.360
Agh!

03:21.280 --> 03:24.600
-Yes, yes. It's just

03:21.280 --> 03:24.600
a little shock.

03:33.280 --> 03:37.320
Nothing. Don't worry. Give it a moment.

03:33.280 --> 03:37.320
It will stop, OK?

03:42.480 --> 03:44.520
Look, just answer the bloody thing, would you?

03:47.720 --> 03:49.440
Hello, this is Dwayne Myers.

03:49.480 --> 03:52.640
I'm not available right now, but if you'd like to leave

03:49.480 --> 03:52.640
a message...

03:52.680 --> 03:56.280
WOMAN ON PHONE:<i> Dwayne,</i> <i>I know that's you.</i>

03:52.680 --> 03:56.280
<i>I need you now.</i>

03:56.320 --> 03:58.320
Estelle, we talked about this.

03:58.360 --> 04:00.920
-I'm at work! -<i> I know! That's why</i>

03:58.360 --> 04:00.920
<i>I'm calling.</i>

04:00.960 --> 04:03.120
I've found a body.

04:03.160 --> 04:04.560
A dead one.

04:07.800 --> 04:10.480
ESTELLE: I got here just after half past three.

04:10.520 --> 04:13.920
I could tell something was wrong straight away. I could feel it.

04:13.960 --> 04:17.960
-It's like I got a fifth sense. -That must come in useful.

04:18.000 --> 04:19.480
Dwayne?

04:19.520 --> 04:22.320
-I work here.

04:22.360 --> 04:24.760
It's a rental place. They just arrived yesterday.

04:24.800 --> 04:26.080
And who are "they" exactly?

04:26.120 --> 04:29.640
Um, wife, husband, wife's sister.

04:29.680 --> 04:32.480
Wife was in a wheelchair. She never stand a chance.

04:32.520 --> 04:35.560
Er, Dwayne, take a full statement from Miss Du Bois.

04:35.600 --> 04:38.320
-Yes. Unless you have something

04:35.600 --> 04:38.320
better to do?

04:38.360 --> 04:40.640
And see if you can get a number for the rental agency.

04:40.680 --> 04:42.840
We need to inform the family.

04:42.880 --> 04:43.960
Chief.

04:46.520 --> 04:48.920
Now, it's my turn to ask the questions.

04:49.320 --> 04:50.840
Yes?

04:56.720 --> 05:00.240
The burglar must've assumed the house was empty,

04:56.720 --> 05:00.240
no one by the pool,

05:00.280 --> 05:02.240
-and took his chances. -Mm.

05:03.560 --> 05:06.000
Well, you can see why she wasn't outside.

05:06.040 --> 05:09.280
Look at that sunburn. Typical Brit abroad.

05:09.320 --> 05:11.640
White bread at breakfast, lobster by lunch.

05:14.720 --> 05:16.720
Strangled by her own scarf.

05:16.760 --> 05:19.680
So she saw the burglar, reached for the phone,

05:19.720 --> 05:23.400
and was strangled before she could call for help?

05:23.440 --> 05:25.480
I should check with the phone company.

05:25.520 --> 05:28.600
If she made a call, it may indicate the time of the attack.

05:28.640 --> 05:30.760
This door's been wiped clean.

05:30.800 --> 05:32.560
You think that's how the killer got in?

05:32.600 --> 05:35.320
No. The perimeter is walled.

05:35.360 --> 05:38.480
You can only enter and leave from the front,

05:35.360 --> 05:38.480
and it was unlocked.

05:38.520 --> 05:41.920
Well, holiday villa,

05:41.960 --> 05:44.000
you wouldn't necessarily lock the door.

05:46.920 --> 05:49.840
So, why would the killer come out here by the pool?

06:03.120 --> 06:07.280
-I'm sorry, sir.

06:03.120 --> 06:07.280
This is a crime scene.

06:07.320 --> 06:11.520
-I'm staying here. With my wife.

06:19.760 --> 06:22.160
So we have a victim in a wheelchair,

06:23.440 --> 06:25.080
alone in the house,

06:26.120 --> 06:28.720
phone in hand, strangled with a scarf,

06:28.760 --> 06:30.880
and indications of a robbery. Hm...

06:34.440 --> 06:36.680
-This is very strange,

06:36.720 --> 06:38.480
but this really reminds me of something.

06:39.920 --> 06:41.920
I feel like I'm having deja vu.

06:41.960 --> 06:44.160
Oh, finally, he speaks French!

06:44.200 --> 06:47.080
There was a case in England, um, five years ago.

06:47.120 --> 06:49.480
Charles Tyburn, elderly, wheelchair bound.

06:49.520 --> 06:54.760
Intruder broke in thinking the house was empty, strangled

06:49.520 --> 06:54.760
Tyburn with his own scarf.

06:54.800 --> 06:56.680
And he was found with the phone in his hand.

06:56.720 --> 06:58.480
Do you think it's the same killer?

06:58.520 --> 07:01.920
Previous crimes cannot be considered relevant to the

06:58.520 --> 07:01.920
present charge,

07:01.960 --> 07:05.800
as in the terms set out by Makin versus...

07:05.840 --> 07:08.440
-I so knew this last night. -Is this for your

07:05.840 --> 07:08.440
sergeants' exam?

07:08.480 --> 07:09.720
I'll never pass at this rate.

07:09.760 --> 07:12.920
Makin versus AG for New South Wales, 1894.

07:12.960 --> 07:16.000
And no, I am not thinking this is the same killer as Tyburn.

07:16.040 --> 07:19.520
It just bears striking similarities to that

07:16.040 --> 07:19.520
crime scene.

07:19.560 --> 07:22.840
So this Charles Tyburn case, did you solve it?

07:22.880 --> 07:25.840
No. No, no, it wasn't my case.

07:25.880 --> 07:29.160
No, it was investigated by one of my more

07:25.880 --> 07:29.160
objectionable colleagues,

07:32.080 --> 07:33.520
...Doug Anderson.

07:42.520 --> 07:45.240
-Will Teague. -POLICE OVER THE PHONE:

07:42.520 --> 07:45.240
<i>Sir, it's the Honore Police.</i>

07:45.280 --> 07:49.520
<i>I'm afraid there's been a death</i> <i>at your rental villa,</i>

07:45.280 --> 07:49.520
<i>Eagle's Edge. June Anderson.</i>

07:49.560 --> 07:51.920
-<i> We need you to come up</i>

07:49.560 --> 07:51.920
<i>right away.</i>

07:51.960 --> 07:54.560
Um, yes. Er, OK.

07:54.600 --> 07:55.960
We'll be straight up there.

08:04.120 --> 08:06.840
You have to get out. Now!

08:06.880 --> 08:09.600
-Go away.

08:09.640 --> 08:12.960
-I said go away! -MAN: June Anderson's

08:09.640 --> 08:12.960
been killed!

08:15.400 --> 08:18.920
I'd heard on the police grapevine you'd been

08:15.400 --> 08:18.920
shipped off somewhere,

08:18.960 --> 08:21.040
-I wasn't shipped, I...

08:21.080 --> 08:25.200
-Yes.

08:29.960 --> 08:32.200
Cause of death?

08:32.240 --> 08:34.400
I'm sorry but your wife was strangled.

08:37.320 --> 08:39.280
So, have you, um,

08:39.320 --> 08:42.920
started rounding up the usual suspects, smackheads, druggies?

08:42.960 --> 08:45.440
-We're still gathering evidence. -Oh, yes, I forgot,

08:45.480 --> 08:50.880
you do like to cross the t's and dot the i's, don't you,

08:45.480 --> 08:50.880
Dicky boy?

08:50.920 --> 08:53.880
I like to do things properly, if that's what you mean.

08:53.920 --> 08:57.280
-I thought we could start

08:53.920 --> 08:57.280
with a few questions.

08:57.320 --> 09:00.640
-I meant you answering them.

09:02.520 --> 09:04.960
Your wife was home alone?

09:05.000 --> 09:08.000
She got sunburn, couldn't go out.

09:08.040 --> 09:12.400
And you're here with her sister? Yes. Janice. She's off at

09:08.040 --> 09:12.400
some spa this afternoon.

09:12.440 --> 09:15.000
-I was at a little bar in town.

09:15.040 --> 09:18.040
Not up to much, but the bird behind the bar

09:15.040 --> 09:18.040
was friendly enough.

09:18.080 --> 09:21.680
Kaz's something?

09:22.440 --> 09:24.040
-Hm.

09:25.760 --> 09:28.680
-Yes, yes! Look, I get it!

09:28.720 --> 09:32.040
Husband, chief suspect. Bang! Done! Dusted!

09:32.080 --> 09:36.680
But now we've established my alibi, perhaps we can move on

09:32.080 --> 09:36.680
to find the real killer.

09:38.920 --> 09:40.600
Doug...

09:40.640 --> 09:42.080
Janice, I'm so sorry.

09:47.760 --> 09:50.200
I left the villa at about quarter to two.

09:51.800 --> 09:55.760
It might've been a few minutes earlier, I'm not sure.

09:55.800 --> 09:57.680
I'm so sorry, it's really important, isn't it?

09:57.720 --> 09:59.760
That's fine. Your brother

09:59.800 --> 10:02.000
Yes. He dropped me at the spa.

10:02.760 --> 10:03.920
Sorry.

10:04.600 --> 10:07.360
I should've been here.

10:09.520 --> 10:11.480
Um, just before two.

10:11.520 --> 10:14.320
I think... I'm sorry.

10:14.360 --> 10:16.240
Maybe five to?

10:16.280 --> 10:19.560
It was meant to be a little treat for me,

10:16.280 --> 10:19.560
but I didn't enjoy it,

10:19.600 --> 10:23.600
knowing it was all my fault that she burnt.

10:23.640 --> 10:28.560
-She was out here in the sun.

10:23.640 --> 10:28.560
She couldn't reach her chair.

10:28.600 --> 10:32.080
-JUNE: I've been calling and calling you!

10:28.600 --> 10:32.080
-I'm so sorry.

10:32.120 --> 10:35.520
I was upstairs listening to my book.

10:35.560 --> 10:37.200
I just didn't hear her.

10:37.240 --> 10:39.880
I've been stuck out here all day!

10:39.920 --> 10:42.600
-Oh, yes! Yes, she was.

10:42.640 --> 10:46.720
She really looked after her skin. Always factor 50.

10:46.760 --> 10:49.440
But obviously it wasn't enough!

10:50.680 --> 10:53.840
It's all my fault. It always is. I'm so stupid.

10:56.360 --> 10:58.600
Who made the travel arrangements,

10:56.360 --> 10:58.600
picked the destination?

10:58.640 --> 11:00.680
Well, Douglas did.

11:00.720 --> 11:03.280
-JANICE: Yes.

11:04.080 --> 11:06.040
It all seemed so perfect.

11:25.480 --> 11:28.480
Doug said he'd been at Catherine's.

11:25.480 --> 11:28.480
Go and check it out.

11:28.520 --> 11:31.120
Find out exactly when he arrived, exactly when he left.

11:32.240 --> 11:35.240
-Exactly. -Yes, Chief.

11:35.280 --> 11:37.240
RICHARD: I want you to get the scarf

11:35.280 --> 11:37.240
to the lab in Guadeloupe.

11:37.280 --> 11:40.360
Tell them to do a VMD test. See if they can lift a print

11:37.280 --> 11:40.360
off the fabric.

11:43.800 --> 11:46.480
You think Doug Anderson killed his own wife.

11:49.680 --> 11:51.080
You don't know him, Camille.

11:51.120 --> 11:53.320
He is one of the most reprehensible detectives

11:53.360 --> 11:55.560
to grace the ranks of the Metropolitan Police.

11:55.600 --> 11:58.440
He takes bribes, intimidates suspects.

11:58.480 --> 12:00.040
He came back drunk from lunch so often,

12:00.080 --> 12:02.800
it was mandatory for him to attend alcohol

12:00.080 --> 12:02.800
support meetings.

12:02.840 --> 12:05.640
That man is a bad apple.

12:06.760 --> 12:08.440
None of that makes him a murderer.

12:22.320 --> 12:23.880
OK, great. Thank you.

12:24.640 --> 12:26.480
Camille,

12:26.520 --> 12:29.520
June Anderson's prints were on the sunscreen bottle

12:26.520 --> 12:29.520
we found by the pool. -So even though she burnt,

12:29.560 --> 12:32.560
she must have applied it. -OK.

12:35.040 --> 12:38.160
You said you had trouble remembering your topics

12:35.040 --> 12:38.160
for your exam.

12:38.200 --> 12:39.560
Yes?

12:39.600 --> 12:41.560
I used this when I was studying for mine.

12:41.600 --> 12:44.680
Oh, great! Yes, thanks, Camille.

12:50.920 --> 12:54.640
I've got the list of the items stolen from the villa.

12:50.920 --> 12:54.640
Mostly jewellery.

12:54.680 --> 12:57.400
I've circulated a description to local dealers.

12:57.440 --> 13:00.200
Right. Now, this phone she was holding,

13:00.240 --> 13:05.120
the phone company said the last call made today

13:00.240 --> 13:05.120
was to a number in England.

13:05.160 --> 13:07.120
So, she didn't call for help?

13:07.160 --> 13:10.400
-It seems not. -Because she was overcome

13:07.160 --> 13:10.400
by her attacker?

13:10.440 --> 13:14.800
Or possibly because the phone was placed in her hand

13:10.440 --> 13:14.800
after she was attacked

13:14.840 --> 13:17.440
to make it appear as if she'd seen her intruder.

13:17.480 --> 13:19.800
Put there by her husband, I presume.

13:24.400 --> 13:27.440
How many times have you told me not to follow my feelings?

13:27.480 --> 13:29.480
If I can't use my intuition, neither can you.

13:29.520 --> 13:32.480
I'm a detective! You can't ban me from using my intuition.

13:32.520 --> 13:35.520
We can't make someone a suspect just because

13:32.520 --> 13:35.520
you don't like them.

13:36.080 --> 13:37.640
That was Dwayne.

13:37.680 --> 13:40.520
Your mother has confirmed that Douglas Anderson was at her bar.

13:40.560 --> 13:42.680
He got there at 2 pm and stayed until 4:30.

13:42.720 --> 13:44.480
Which rules him out.

13:44.520 --> 13:47.120
-The only time he left was to get cigarettes from Eldred's.

13:44.520 --> 13:47.120
-Ah-ha.

13:47.160 --> 13:49.600
-No longer than ten minutes.

13:49.640 --> 13:51.120
Dwayne had Catherine check the till roll.

13:51.160 --> 13:53.720
Mr Anderson bought a drink when he came back at 2:32.

13:53.760 --> 13:56.760
Right. And the drive to Eagle's Edge is what,

13:53.760 --> 13:56.760
five or six minutes?

13:56.800 --> 13:59.280
So, if the ten minutes he left the bar was say,

13:59.320 --> 14:02.120
12, maybe even 15,

14:02.160 --> 14:04.400
it's just possible to place him at the scene.

14:06.560 --> 14:10.000
<i>Merci.</i> I knew Eldred had CCTV in his shop.

14:10.040 --> 14:12.120
I thought this was the logical place

14:12.160 --> 14:14.920
to check Doug's movements for the missing ten minutes?

14:15.840 --> 14:17.640
You see?

14:18.560 --> 14:21.120
And the time, 2:24pm.

14:21.160 --> 14:22.560
-Yes, but he may have... -Yes, wait!

14:23.480 --> 14:27.200
2:26 pm, 2:27 pm... See?

14:27.240 --> 14:29.480
He wasn't zooming back to the villa to kill his wife...

14:29.520 --> 14:33.160
Whoa, stop, stop the tape! Rewind it.

14:33.200 --> 14:34.480
Yes, there. Now play.

14:36.800 --> 14:37.920
Freeze it.

14:43.240 --> 14:45.560
He's smiling at the camera.

14:45.600 --> 14:48.440
He knows he's being filmed. He is smiling at the camera!

14:48.480 --> 14:51.400
No, he is a man smiling because he's on holiday,

14:51.440 --> 14:54.240
smoking a cigarette and not strangling his wife!

14:54.280 --> 14:57.360
His alibi holds up. He couldn't have done it.

15:00.200 --> 15:03.280
You do remember that it's my wife who was murdered?

15:03.320 --> 15:05.760
Yes, of course. And you have my sincere condolences...

15:05.800 --> 15:08.560
All I want to know is what leads you're following up.

15:08.600 --> 15:12.440
I told you, you're not on duty. You're not attached to this case

15:12.480 --> 15:15.200
in any official capacity! It would be

15:12.480 --> 15:15.200
wholly inappropriate-

15:15.240 --> 15:18.440
Didn't you ever wonder why nobody liked you

15:15.240 --> 15:18.440
in the division?

15:21.520 --> 15:23.200
-Well...

15:23.240 --> 15:27.440
You don't seem to get the fact that, as coppers,

15:27.480 --> 15:30.680
we're all in it together. Us and them.

15:30.720 --> 15:33.080
It's not about doing it by the book.

15:33.120 --> 15:35.240
It's about taking care of our own,

15:35.280 --> 15:37.480
-watching each others' backs. -I'm not sure that's...

15:37.520 --> 15:39.760
Don't get smart with me, Dicky boy.

15:41.440 --> 15:43.280
All I'm asking is,

15:43.320 --> 15:45.240
have you got any suspects?

15:46.560 --> 15:48.640
And if you don't want to tell me as a copper,

15:49.760 --> 15:52.000
tell me as the victim's husband.

15:55.960 --> 15:57.360
No. No, I haven't.

15:58.440 --> 15:59.680
OK!

16:02.680 --> 16:06.400
I'm not trying to bust your chops, Dick.

16:06.440 --> 16:09.040
I just want to help catch whoever did this, OK?

16:20.920 --> 16:22.680
The pathology report is back.

16:22.720 --> 16:25.960
-It confirms strangulation

16:22.720 --> 16:25.960
as cause of death.

16:26.000 --> 16:27.400
Which we already knew.

16:30.440 --> 16:33.880
There was a wide contusion across the front of the neck.

16:30.440 --> 16:33.880
Look.

16:33.920 --> 16:38.840
If she was strangled from behind, that makes it

16:33.920 --> 16:38.840
less likely...

16:38.880 --> 16:44.080
...that she surprised a burglar and more likely

16:38.880 --> 16:44.080
to be pre-meditated murder.

16:44.120 --> 16:46.400
Which will explain why she didn't make the call.

16:47.200 --> 16:48.280
So, er...

16:49.400 --> 16:50.840
...he crept up on her.

16:52.200 --> 16:54.240
I knew it. That scene was staged!

16:54.280 --> 16:58.920
But would the killer really leave it to chance that

16:54.280 --> 16:58.920
she would be wearing a scarf?

16:58.960 --> 17:02.320
Maybe the killer already knew she would be wearing it.

17:02.360 --> 17:05.040
Like her husband, you mean?

17:05.080 --> 17:07.600
Look, I thought you were getting these fans fixed!

17:07.640 --> 17:09.360
Jonah said he'd be here about 11.

17:09.400 --> 17:12.520
Yes, is that 11:00 real time or 11:00...

17:13.280 --> 17:15.200
...island time?

17:16.520 --> 17:18.200
Wait, what if he cheated the time of death?

17:18.840 --> 17:20.520
Huh?

17:20.560 --> 17:23.600
We've proved he didn't kill her between 1:45,

17:20.560 --> 17:23.600
when he and Janice left,

17:23.640 --> 17:26.080
and 3:30pm, when the body was discovered,

17:26.120 --> 17:28.680
but what if he somehow killed her before that

17:29.920 --> 17:32.000
We need to speak to the sister again.

17:36.200 --> 17:38.000
JANICE: Would you like a drink? I'm sorry,

17:38.040 --> 17:41.000
I don't have any juice, but I could get you some water.

17:41.040 --> 17:42.120
No, thank you.

17:46.400 --> 17:51.840
I need you to tell me exactly when you last saw

17:46.400 --> 17:51.840
your sister alive.

17:51.880 --> 17:56.640
I told you yesterday, it would've been when I left

17:51.880 --> 17:56.640
for the spa, at about 1.45.

17:56.680 --> 17:58.880
And when you last saw June,

17:58.920 --> 18:01.160
she was wearing the zebra

18:01.200 --> 18:03.160
No. She thought she'd lost it.

18:03.200 --> 18:05.000
Lost it? Yes, it was new.

18:05.040 --> 18:07.280
Doug bought it for her. Duty free.

18:07.320 --> 18:08.800
Doug bought it?

18:08.840 --> 18:12.640
Yes. But when we, um, started unloading the car at the villa,

18:12.680 --> 18:14.920
she couldn't find it.

18:14.960 --> 18:17.680
She must've found it again when we were out.

18:17.720 --> 18:20.760
When you left, after saying goodbye to your sister,

18:20.800 --> 18:23.560
-Yes.

18:23.600 --> 18:25.680
Well, no, actually.

18:28.640 --> 18:33.760
<i>I realised as we were leaving</i> <i>that I'd forgotten my purse.</i>

18:28.640 --> 18:33.760
<i>I'm always forgetting things.</i>

18:33.800 --> 18:37.440
-Hurry up. -I'm sorry. I'll just

18:33.800 --> 18:37.440
be two minutes.

18:37.480 --> 18:40.080
And Doug was alone for how long?

18:40.120 --> 18:43.240
Well, I can't have been in the house for more than two minutes.

18:43.280 --> 18:47.280
-Yes. Yes, he was.

18:47.320 --> 18:52.280
OK, so, er, when you came to leave the villa again,

18:47.320 --> 18:52.280
after picking up your purse,

18:52.320 --> 18:54.200
you didn't see your sister again?

18:54.240 --> 18:56.800
No. Sorry.

18:59.200 --> 19:02.600
How long had your sister been in a wheelchair?

19:02.640 --> 19:06.040
She had a car accident in Corfu ten years ago.

19:06.080 --> 19:08.560
And, erm, when did she meet Doug?

19:08.600 --> 19:11.080
Funny story, I suppose! I was seeing him first,

19:11.120 --> 19:15.120
and, well, things didn't work out, and, er,

19:15.160 --> 19:17.560
well, he started dating June.

19:17.600 --> 19:19.600
That didn't upset you? Are you sure

19:25.160 --> 19:27.160
I can't get you some water?

19:29.280 --> 19:31.000
No. No, thank you.

19:32.680 --> 19:36.760
Oh, actually, um, I do have one last question.

19:36.800 --> 19:39.000
Was June left

19:39.040 --> 19:42.320
June? Left-handed. We both are. Were...

19:43.560 --> 19:44.640
Thank you.

19:48.480 --> 19:51.880
So Doug could've strangled his wife while

19:48.480 --> 19:51.880
Janice was getting her purse.

19:51.920 --> 19:54.080
And he bought the scarf.

19:54.120 --> 19:56.960
But why did the scarf go missing?

19:57.000 --> 20:01.680
I don't know. Maybe Doug hid it, you know, so he could pounce

19:57.000 --> 20:01.680
when he had the chance.

20:01.720 --> 20:04.240
But he didn't know Janice would forget her purse.

20:04.280 --> 20:06.920
Or that June would have sunburn.

20:06.960 --> 20:13.040
And why would he place the phone in her right hand, knowing

20:06.960 --> 20:13.040
that she was left

20:13.080 --> 20:15.840
That's usually the kind of thing you'd be the first to spot,

20:15.880 --> 20:19.960
but because it doesn't match your theory that Doug

20:15.880 --> 20:19.960
is the killer, you ignore it.

20:20.000 --> 20:21.880
-I am not ignoring it. -Yes, you are.

20:21.920 --> 20:25.320
Just like you're ignoring the fact that June took

20:21.920 --> 20:25.320
her sister's boyfriend.

20:35.640 --> 20:38.920
Sir, the lab in Guadeloupe called.

20:38.960 --> 20:42.160
They did a VMD test, enabling them to

20:38.960 --> 20:42.160
lift a print off the scarf.

20:42.200 --> 20:43.280
Doug Anderson's?

20:43.320 --> 20:44.440
ALL: No.

20:44.480 --> 20:46.880
Sir, it's unidentified.

20:46.920 --> 20:49.560
But from the size, they believe it could be that of a woman.

20:49.600 --> 20:51.000
Janice Palmer?

20:51.040 --> 20:54.080
No. I matched it with the exclusion prints. It's not hers.

20:54.120 --> 20:56.840
But interestingly enough, it's not June Anderson's either.

20:56.880 --> 20:59.880
There was some kind of oil mixed in with the print.

20:59.920 --> 21:02.040
-No. It's more like a lubricant.

21:02.080 --> 21:06.080
Hm. Well, if June Anderson's prints weren't on the scarf,

21:06.120 --> 21:10.160
that rather implies she didn't find it, as her sister

21:06.120 --> 21:10.160
suggested.

21:10.200 --> 21:12.280
I just checked the number June phoned in England.

21:12.320 --> 21:14.160
It was a friend in the UK.

21:14.200 --> 21:17.960
She said she spoke to June at 2:40pm, meaning she was

21:14.200 --> 21:17.960
still alive then.

21:18.000 --> 21:20.960
During the time Doug Anderson was at my mother's bar.

21:21.000 --> 21:25.880
Yes, remember? The till roll clearly stated that

21:21.000 --> 21:25.880
he bought a drink at 2:32pm.

21:25.920 --> 21:31.560
So that's it. We can say with certainty Doug Anderson

21:25.920 --> 21:31.560
did not kill his wife!

21:42.680 --> 21:45.720
You're right. I was wrong and...and...

21:47.680 --> 21:49.080
...and you were right.

21:49.120 --> 21:51.400
By focusing on Doug Anderson,

21:51.440 --> 21:55.040
I let my feelings about a former colleague

21:51.440 --> 21:55.040
get in the way of the facts.

21:58.200 --> 22:02.840
I apologise to you all. I only hope my hubris hasn't

21:58.200 --> 22:02.840
impeded the investigation.

22:02.880 --> 22:04.880
From now on, we widen things out.

22:04.920 --> 22:06.800
I want background checks on everyone

22:06.840 --> 22:10.080
-who came into contact with June since she arrived.

22:06.840 --> 22:10.080
-Chief.

22:10.120 --> 22:13.680
-Contact the spa. Let's check the sister's alibi.

22:10.120 --> 22:13.680
-Sir.

22:13.720 --> 22:15.680
And what are you doing?

22:15.720 --> 22:18.560
I'm going to answer the question you have quite rightly

22:15.720 --> 22:18.560
been asking

22:18.600 --> 22:21.160
since the beginning of this investigation,

22:21.200 --> 22:22.920
why did June Anderson burn

22:22.960 --> 22:26.640
if she was wearing factor

22:26.680 --> 22:30.000
I'm not cooking for them any more. It's creepy!

22:30.040 --> 22:32.560
Well, I'm sorry, but they've booked a chef for two weeks.

22:32.600 --> 22:35.560
What if I am next? The killer is still out there,

22:32.600 --> 22:35.560
you know.

22:35.600 --> 22:37.640
Estelle, I'm sure you'll be alright.

22:37.680 --> 22:39.600
Unless you eat your own cooking...

22:39.640 --> 22:40.920
What?

22:40.960 --> 22:43.160
Your, er, swordfish...

22:43.200 --> 22:45.480
We were both sick yesterday.

22:45.520 --> 22:47.560
There was nothing wrong with that fish!

22:47.600 --> 22:50.120
Don't take it out on me just 'cause

22:47.600 --> 22:50.120
your girlfriend dump you!

22:51.960 --> 22:53.560
I didn't say a word.

22:53.600 --> 22:55.000
-Oh!

22:56.880 --> 22:58.080
Hello.

22:59.320 --> 23:00.600
No, don't do that!

23:01.480 --> 23:03.960
Look, I'll deal with it, OK?

23:04.000 --> 23:05.040
No...

23:05.720 --> 23:06.840
Just wait! OK, bye.

23:09.960 --> 23:11.080
Everything alright?

23:11.120 --> 23:15.400
Er, yes. That was Mr Davis at Palm Bay.

23:15.440 --> 23:18.240
Er, the air con's on the blink. I said I'd go over.

23:34.920 --> 23:36.600
Sorry, what is going on?

23:36.640 --> 23:39.520
My wife's been murdered and you're sat sunning yourself.

23:39.560 --> 23:42.400
-I was... -Is that what passes

23:39.560 --> 23:42.400
for an investigation round here?

23:42.440 --> 23:46.280
What are you going to do next, interview suspects during

23:42.440 --> 23:46.280
Happy Hour?

23:46.320 --> 23:48.960
Actually, I was just testing your wife's sunscreen.

23:49.000 --> 23:52.840
This arm's got June's sunscreen on and this arm's got nothing.

23:52.880 --> 23:54.520
Well, big surprise there,

23:54.560 --> 23:58.600
the arm with sunscreen is burning.

23:58.640 --> 24:02.120
-I thought it might've been tampered with so...

23:58.640 --> 24:02.120
-I can't believe this.

24:02.160 --> 24:06.840
If we were in the UK and the wife of one of our own

24:02.160 --> 24:06.840
had been murdered,

24:06.880 --> 24:09.840
any normal copper would have men

24:06.880 --> 24:09.840
banging down doors,

24:09.880 --> 24:11.720
they'd be out looking for witnesses,

24:11.760 --> 24:15.920
scouring the landscape for any shred of evidence

24:11.760 --> 24:15.920
until we got a result.

24:15.960 --> 24:18.440
-I will get a result. -Once you've topped up

24:15.960 --> 24:18.440
your tan?

24:18.480 --> 24:20.440
This is my wife we're talking about!

24:20.480 --> 24:24.840
-There's no need... -Oh, I forgot. You don't know

24:20.480 --> 24:24.840
what that's like, do you?

24:24.880 --> 24:28.000
Never been married have you, Dick?

24:28.040 --> 24:30.840
Never even had a girlfriend, as far as I remember.

24:40.600 --> 24:45.640
Well, um, it looks as though June Anderson's sunscreen

24:40.600 --> 24:45.640
wasn't tampered with.

24:45.680 --> 24:47.240
He's not a very nice man, is he?

24:47.280 --> 24:50.480
No, no, he's not a very nice man.

24:47.280 --> 24:50.480
But as you rightly say,

24:50.520 --> 24:52.120
that doesn't make him a murderer.

25:26.000 --> 25:28.680
Janice Palmer didn't turn up for her appointment at the spa.

25:28.720 --> 25:31.360
So, her whereabouts are unaccounted for?

25:31.400 --> 25:34.520
I've also completed the background check.

25:34.560 --> 25:37.120
She stands to inherit her sister's fortune.

25:37.160 --> 25:39.320
-Her father was in pest control.

25:39.360 --> 25:40.920
He built up quite an empire.

25:40.960 --> 25:43.360
When he died, he left all the money to June.

25:43.400 --> 25:45.400
Right. And what about him?

25:45.440 --> 25:47.120
DWAYNE: He gets nothing, as far as I can see.

25:47.160 --> 25:50.200
I also checked out the car accident that

25:47.160 --> 25:50.200
paralysed June in Corfu.

25:50.240 --> 25:51.680
And?

25:51.720 --> 25:53.800
Janice was driving.

25:53.840 --> 25:56.400
You think maybe that was the first attempt

25:53.840 --> 25:56.400
on her sister's life?

25:57.720 --> 26:00.160
Maybe she's waited ten years before trying again?

26:03.480 --> 26:04.720
Opal!

26:04.760 --> 26:06.560
Opal!

26:16.560 --> 26:19.840
Mummy's going to buy you the biggest fish she can find!

26:28.600 --> 26:29.760
Oh, God!

26:32.040 --> 26:34.320
-Leave me alone. -Just give me five minutes.

26:42.400 --> 26:44.480
I gave you a year and a half and all you've done is lie to me.

26:44.520 --> 26:46.960
-I haven't cheated on you. -Don't insult my intelligence.

26:47.000 --> 26:48.960
Tell me what I'm meant to have done!

26:49.000 --> 26:52.920
Just get lost, Ronnie. I mean it! Just go see her,

26:49.000 --> 26:52.920
whoever she is.

26:52.960 --> 26:56.600
There is nothing you can say that will make me want to be

26:52.960 --> 26:56.600
in the same room as you.

27:02.920 --> 27:05.280
CAMILLE: Why did you lie about going to the spa?

27:06.320 --> 27:08.240
It just seemed silly,

27:08.280 --> 27:11.520
a hot island and I go and sit in a sauna?

27:12.320 --> 27:13.640
So, where did you go?

27:13.680 --> 27:16.800
Oh, well, I... Nowhere really.

27:16.840 --> 27:19.920
I just wanted to be by myself.

27:23.120 --> 27:27.880
Janice, we also know it was you driving the car in which

27:23.120 --> 27:27.880
your sister was paralysed.

27:27.920 --> 27:30.000
Yes. Yes, it was me.

27:30.040 --> 27:31.960
Blame me. Everyone else has.

27:32.000 --> 27:35.080
I don't want to blame you, but I need to understand.

27:35.120 --> 27:38.760
You can't understand what it's like to live with that,

27:38.800 --> 27:42.320
to be responsible for ruining your sister's life.

27:42.360 --> 27:46.200
And she made me pay every single day. And Dad!

27:46.240 --> 27:48.200
He left all his money to her,

27:48.240 --> 27:51.760
not to take care of her, but to punish me.

27:51.800 --> 27:57.000
And she held onto those purse strings so tightly, too.

27:57.040 --> 28:00.560
It could just as easily have been her driving

27:57.040 --> 28:00.560
that night in Corfu.

28:00.600 --> 28:03.520
But it wasn't. It was me.

28:03.560 --> 28:05.800
I need to know where you went yesterday.

28:05.840 --> 28:09.160
Doug dropped me off, and then I got in a taxi

28:09.200 --> 28:11.680
and I asked him to take me to a bar.

28:11.720 --> 28:13.320
Any bar.

28:13.360 --> 28:16.200
-I wanted to meet someone.

28:16.240 --> 28:21.280
I just wanted to be a person, just for once.

28:21.320 --> 28:24.960
I wanted to be someone other than the sister,

28:25.000 --> 28:26.200
the carer,

28:26.240 --> 28:27.840
the guilty party.

28:30.400 --> 28:32.120
Did you meet anyone?

28:32.160 --> 28:34.880
Can anyone else vouch for you being in this bar?

28:34.920 --> 28:36.400
I don't know.

28:36.440 --> 28:39.760
It was called The Shack or something.

28:39.800 --> 28:41.600
The barman was chatty but...

28:43.680 --> 28:48.080
And what's this selfishness got me,

28:43.680 --> 28:48.080
now June's dead?

28:48.120 --> 28:50.720
I've got all the freedom I want, I've got all the money I need,

28:50.760 --> 28:51.920
but the guilt...

28:53.400 --> 28:55.240
It'll never go away, will it?

28:59.200 --> 29:00.640
I think someone came here today.

29:00.680 --> 29:03.040
No, in fact, I know they did. And it was really strange.

29:03.080 --> 29:05.120
I could hear someone in the house,

29:05.160 --> 29:07.800
and then I saw them just as they were driving away.

29:07.840 --> 29:09.440
Can you give me a description?

29:09.480 --> 29:12.880
Yes, a man from the rental agency,

29:09.480 --> 29:12.880
the one who moved us here.

29:12.920 --> 29:13.960
Will.

29:16.360 --> 29:18.400
I called the bar Janice Palmer was at.

29:18.440 --> 29:22.040
They said she had been in, but couldn't be certain about

29:18.440 --> 29:22.040
the time she left.

29:22.080 --> 29:25.920
So, she could easily have had time to get back and

29:22.080 --> 29:25.920
murder her sister?

29:25.960 --> 29:27.600
I don't think so.

29:27.640 --> 29:31.440
She seemed to resent her sister, said she wasn't generous

29:27.640 --> 29:31.440
with money,

29:31.480 --> 29:34.640
but I had the feeling she was really sorry she was dead.

29:34.680 --> 29:36.440
Oh, right. Right. You had a feeling...

29:37.600 --> 29:39.640
We just got a call from a jeweller.

29:39.680 --> 29:42.080
Someone tried to sell June Anderson's jewellery.

29:42.720 --> 29:43.800
Who?

29:43.840 --> 29:45.680
-Dwayne's Estelle. -Hey!

29:51.120 --> 29:52.720
She's not my Estelle.

29:56.040 --> 29:57.760
RICHARD: How did you acquire these pieces?

29:57.800 --> 29:59.120
I found them.

29:59.160 --> 30:01.480
-I was looking for my cat.

30:01.520 --> 30:04.280
Were you aware that you were impeding a murder investigation?

30:04.320 --> 30:06.600
I didn't know they belonged to her.

30:06.640 --> 30:09.800
My tea leaves said it was going to be my lucky week so...

30:09.840 --> 30:11.640
Not so lucky for June Anderson.

30:11.680 --> 30:14.120
From what I could see, she'd had enough luck

30:11.680 --> 30:14.120
in her life.

30:14.160 --> 30:16.680
Nice clothes, fancy holidays...

30:16.720 --> 30:20.280
-Estelle, that doesn't justify you...

30:16.720 --> 30:20.280
-Dwayne! Don't judge me.

30:20.320 --> 30:24.520
How do you think it feels to be working in houses

30:20.320 --> 30:24.520
nicer than your own every day,

30:24.560 --> 30:26.600
scrubbing and cooking?

30:26.640 --> 30:30.960
I grew up on this island and they swan in and use it! Use me!

30:31.000 --> 30:32.920
Even Ronnie and Will,

30:32.960 --> 30:35.600
I know how much they charge for those villas and

30:32.960 --> 30:35.600
I know how much they pay me.

30:35.640 --> 30:38.240
So yes, I took the jewels.

30:38.280 --> 30:40.800
And you know what? It's not all I take!

30:40.840 --> 30:44.000
Half-finished rum bottles, uneaten chicken...

30:44.040 --> 30:48.240
I even go through their bins for fish for my cat,

30:44.040 --> 30:48.240
and it ends up killing her!

30:48.280 --> 30:50.280
God rest her soul.

30:50.320 --> 30:54.200
How d'you think it makes me feel, stealing food at my age?

30:54.240 --> 30:57.440
And if that's a crime, then lock me up!

30:58.480 --> 30:59.760
Actually, it is a crime.

31:02.840 --> 31:05.280
You and Fidel search the area where these were found,

31:05.320 --> 31:07.600
-see if you can find anything else.

31:05.320 --> 31:07.600
-Yes, Chief.

31:22.960 --> 31:24.880
-No.

31:25.320 --> 31:26.360
Not yet.

31:29.280 --> 31:32.240
I'm sorry I didn't say anything about the jewels.

31:32.280 --> 31:33.960
Never mind about that now.

31:34.960 --> 31:36.560
It's just,

31:36.600 --> 31:39.360
you know, I get so lonely.

31:39.400 --> 31:43.800
And now with Opal gone, I don't have anyone. So,

31:43.840 --> 31:46.600
you know, if one night, maybe wanted to...

31:46.640 --> 31:50.600
Estelle! The couple of times we went out, I had fun.

31:50.640 --> 31:53.040
I know you did. We both did, didn't we?

31:53.080 --> 31:55.400
Yes. But that's all it was.

31:56.520 --> 31:58.280
Are you dumping me?

31:58.320 --> 32:00.440
Estelle, we were never an item...

32:00.480 --> 32:02.200
FIDEL: Dwayne! I've got something!

32:04.560 --> 32:07.320
-It's exactly the same brand as June Anderson used.

32:04.560 --> 32:07.320
-Hm.

32:07.360 --> 32:09.040
The killer must've come from Eagle's Edge,

32:09.080 --> 32:11.600
tried to throw it into the bushes

32:09.080 --> 32:11.600
with the jewellery.

32:16.600 --> 32:17.680
Hm!

32:19.000 --> 32:20.880
I'd like you to dust this for prints.

32:32.120 --> 32:35.600
-I'm beginning to think you're enjoying the sun.

32:32.120 --> 32:35.600
-Hm.

32:44.480 --> 32:46.720
I'm sorry your friend isn't the killer.

32:46.760 --> 32:48.040
He's hardly my friend!

32:48.080 --> 32:49.640
No, but you know what I mean.

32:50.640 --> 32:51.720
Yes.

32:54.080 --> 32:57.440
-It must've been difficult working with him.

32:54.080 --> 32:57.440
-Yes. Yes, it was.

33:01.960 --> 33:03.280
He called me Dick.

33:05.080 --> 33:06.600
It can't be just that.

33:08.440 --> 33:10.680
Well, when I joined the Met, people questioned my methods.

33:10.720 --> 33:13.240
They said I was pedantic... Well, yes.

33:13.280 --> 33:15.480
-Exacting... -Just like here.

33:15.520 --> 33:18.520
But I got results. In the end, people came to see that.

33:18.560 --> 33:22.680
They almost, er, dare I say it, respected for me.

33:22.720 --> 33:24.960
-So they should. -Yes.

33:25.000 --> 33:29.000
-And then Doug Anderson joined our team.

33:25.000 --> 33:29.000
-Ah!

33:29.040 --> 33:31.440
I'm guessing he wasn't respecting your methods?

33:31.480 --> 33:35.680
He was the life and soul of the party, everybody's mate.

33:31.480 --> 33:35.680
Except mine.

33:35.720 --> 33:40.040
He sort of singled me out. Started calling me Dick.

33:40.080 --> 33:43.680
Before I knew it, the whole station was calling me Dick.

33:43.720 --> 33:46.400
That's just what bullies do, isn't it? They, er...

33:46.440 --> 33:48.600
You know, they...

33:48.640 --> 33:53.680
Well, they turn the pack against you by setting you apart

33:48.640 --> 33:53.680
from the group.

33:53.720 --> 33:57.400
Two years later, Doug got a promotion,

33:53.720 --> 33:57.400
moved to a different division,

33:57.440 --> 33:59.480
and, um...

33:59.520 --> 34:03.440
Well, you know, I was stuck there, the fool in the corner.

34:03.480 --> 34:06.040
You're a lot of things but you're not a fool.

34:06.720 --> 34:08.760
Picky, stubborn,

34:08.800 --> 34:10.240
-impatient... -All right, thank you!

34:10.280 --> 34:12.880
Infuriating, irritating, difficult...

34:12.920 --> 34:16.400
Stop any time you like. Hang on. Wait.

34:16.440 --> 34:18.440
-Both my feet have gone red.

34:18.480 --> 34:22.400
See, it wasn't sunscreen in the bottle Fidel found.

34:22.440 --> 34:24.000
So, what was it?

34:24.040 --> 34:27.000
I don't know. Moisturiser maybe?

34:27.040 --> 34:31.040
So the killer must've exchanged the bottles after she died.

34:31.080 --> 34:34.040
-Which explains why they went out through the pool.

34:31.080 --> 34:34.040
-Yes.

34:34.080 --> 34:38.440
Someone wanted June Anderson to get sunburned so

34:34.080 --> 34:38.440
she'd be home alone.

34:38.480 --> 34:40.480
There was a print on the bottle I found.

34:40.520 --> 34:41.840
Will Teague's.

34:44.280 --> 34:48.160
Will Teague and Ronnie Stuart met while they were both

34:44.280 --> 34:48.160
working in private security.

34:48.200 --> 34:51.040
They were based in the Gulf, protecting oil convoys.

34:51.080 --> 34:53.360
-FIDEL: No.

34:53.400 --> 34:55.720
DWAYNE: The only thing we found relating to Will's wife

34:55.760 --> 34:59.160
is that she was killed in a hit-and-run in

34:55.760 --> 34:59.160
Manchester last year.

34:59.200 --> 35:00.400
How terrible.

35:00.440 --> 35:02.320
DWAYNE: He got a big chunk of life insurance.

35:02.360 --> 35:04.600
We think that's how he funded his move here.

35:04.640 --> 35:07.720
It helped him invest in the rental business with Ronnie.

35:07.760 --> 35:11.480
Were there any suspicious circumstances

35:07.760 --> 35:11.480
around his wife's death?

35:11.520 --> 35:16.000
Don't seem to be. They got an E-FIT of the driver, but the van

35:11.520 --> 35:16.000
turned out to be stolen.

35:16.040 --> 35:17.720
There were never any convictions,

35:17.760 --> 35:20.560
and the police eliminated Will from their enquiries early on.

35:23.560 --> 35:24.800
RICHARD: What about Ronnie?

35:24.840 --> 35:26.880
He suddenly had a very rich partner.

35:26.920 --> 35:29.640
You mean, he could've killed Will's wife?

35:29.680 --> 35:31.760
He seemed to benefit from her death.

35:31.800 --> 35:34.960
No. I cross-checked the dates. He was here in Saint-Marie.

35:35.000 --> 35:36.480
CAMILLE: I don't get it.

35:36.520 --> 35:39.240
What motive could Will Teague have for killing June Anderson?

35:39.280 --> 35:41.960
Why don't we ask him?

35:42.000 --> 35:44.960
Yes, I can tell you why my prints were on the bottle.

35:45.000 --> 35:49.120
We stock the villas with all the products,

35:45.000 --> 35:49.120
shampoo, shower gel, sunscreen.

35:49.160 --> 35:51.440
I would've put it in the villa.

35:51.480 --> 35:54.000
They could've just as easily been my prints.

35:54.040 --> 35:56.800
So, you have no idea how the moisturiser

35:54.040 --> 35:56.800
got in the bottle?

35:56.840 --> 35:58.480
No.

35:58.520 --> 36:01.760
We need to get back into Eagle's Edge at some stage

35:58.520 --> 36:01.760
to clean it up.

36:01.800 --> 36:03.600
Are we allowed back in yet?

36:03.640 --> 36:06.360
When we're finished here, yes.

36:06.400 --> 36:08.960
So, you hadn't met June Anderson before this week?

36:09.000 --> 36:11.640
No. I'd never spoken to her before.

36:09.000 --> 36:11.640
Neither of us had.

36:11.680 --> 36:13.800
The first time I met her was when I picked them up

36:11.680 --> 36:13.800
from the airport.

36:13.840 --> 36:15.360
You're sure about that?

36:15.840 --> 36:17.280
Yes.

36:17.320 --> 36:19.360
And I had food poisoning at the time of the murder.

36:19.400 --> 36:23.480
Estelle cooked us some swordfish.

36:23.520 --> 36:26.240
We were throwing up all night and out cold the next day.

36:26.280 --> 36:28.920
So, your alibi is your best friend?

36:28.960 --> 36:31.920
No. My alibi is, I was sick as a dog.

36:31.960 --> 36:36.200
Then, maybe you can explain why you entered

36:31.960 --> 36:36.200
Allamanda Retreat earlier today?

36:37.880 --> 36:40.120
You said you were fixing the air con at Palm Bay.

36:40.160 --> 36:42.280
Look, don't get mad.

36:42.320 --> 36:44.120
What?

36:44.160 --> 36:46.120
I let Lily stay at Allamanda.

36:46.160 --> 36:48.840
She had nowhere else to go and the villa was empty.

36:51.520 --> 36:54.360
Lily Shaw. She's my ex-fiancee.

36:54.400 --> 36:57.160
We finished a couple of days ago.

36:54.400 --> 36:57.160
She accused me of cheating.

36:57.200 --> 36:59.440
-She told me what happened,

36:59.480 --> 37:02.320
about the secret calls, the presents she found...

37:02.360 --> 37:04.120
Can we focus, please?

37:04.160 --> 37:06.200
Why did you go to the villa?

37:07.200 --> 37:09.480
Lily left her make-up bag there.

37:09.520 --> 37:12.600
-I went to get it for her. -One more thing...

37:12.640 --> 37:16.360
Your wife was killed in a hit

37:16.400 --> 37:19.720
Yes. I don't see what that has to do with anything?

37:19.760 --> 37:21.280
Neither do I yet.

37:21.320 --> 37:25.920
But, er, it was after she died that you came to Saint

37:25.960 --> 37:28.560
Yes. Ronnie asked if I'd invest in the company,

37:28.600 --> 37:32.600
so he came to Manchester to see us just before my wife died.

37:32.640 --> 37:35.440
But Karen, she thought...

37:35.480 --> 37:38.560
She thought I might drink the money away!

37:38.600 --> 37:41.600
You're over the death of your wife

37:38.600 --> 37:41.600
and you're moving on to Lily?

37:41.640 --> 37:43.440
WILL: We're just friends!

37:43.480 --> 37:46.280
RONNIE: So, she's the one that's cheating? I don't believe this.

37:46.320 --> 37:47.680
Thank you for your time, gentleman.

37:52.600 --> 37:54.840
Hey, what's happened?

37:54.880 --> 37:56.920
We need to speak to Lily Shaw.

38:07.880 --> 38:09.760
RICHARD: Not long.

38:09.800 --> 38:13.640
He's being secretive. I know the signs from last time.

38:09.800 --> 38:13.640
He acts differently and...

38:13.680 --> 38:18.960
You told Will Teague that he bought this other woman

38:13.680 --> 38:18.960
something, a present?

38:19.000 --> 38:21.560
-I found it at the back of the wardrobe.

38:21.600 --> 38:25.080
No. You should've seen it. It was for a much older woman.

38:25.120 --> 38:27.280
-Oh, my God...

38:27.320 --> 38:28.360
Yes.

38:29.120 --> 38:30.200
What...

38:30.720 --> 38:33.560
Ah, Fidel,

38:33.600 --> 38:37.000
I want you to check the prints on this photo

38:37.040 --> 38:39.760
against the ones on this scarf.

38:39.800 --> 38:41.960
Then I need you to talk to Janice Palmer.

38:42.000 --> 38:46.240
Find out about their arrival on the island. Exact details,

38:42.000 --> 38:46.240
if you would.

38:46.280 --> 38:49.480
And then I need you to call this number

38:50.160 --> 38:51.840
in England. Hm?

38:53.000 --> 38:54.600
Right, Camille...

38:56.520 --> 38:58.400
You and I have got a body to dig up.

39:02.640 --> 39:05.520
We just thought we'd update you on the murder investigation.

39:05.560 --> 39:07.320
-Almost.

39:07.360 --> 39:09.920
We're just making the last few connections.

39:09.960 --> 39:13.360
June Anderson had never been to Saint-Marie before,

39:13.400 --> 39:17.680
but, er, everyone else here had been to the UK.

39:17.720 --> 39:20.760
Except you, Estelle. Are you trying to

39:17.720 --> 39:20.760
pin this on me?

39:20.800 --> 39:25.200
We're just wondering whether June Anderson

39:20.800 --> 39:25.200
met her killer in the UK.

39:25.240 --> 39:27.240
Um...

39:27.280 --> 39:29.880
Ronnie! You travelled back and forth to the UK.

39:29.920 --> 39:32.760
In fact, you went to visit Will in Manchester last year.

39:32.800 --> 39:36.680
-No, no, no. It's not a crime.

39:36.720 --> 39:39.720
And, Will, you lived in the UK until quite recently.

39:39.760 --> 39:43.160
In fact, er, until just after the death of your wife.

39:43.200 --> 39:45.280
Yes. That's true.

39:45.320 --> 39:49.160
But there's no connection between anybody here and

39:45.320 --> 39:49.160
June Anderson?

39:49.200 --> 39:51.280
None at all.

39:51.320 --> 39:52.560
And yet, one of you killed her.

39:55.240 --> 39:56.560
Ronnie Stuart.

39:58.000 --> 39:59.040
No.

40:02.040 --> 40:04.920
You substituted June's sunscreen,

40:04.960 --> 40:09.520
ensuring she'd burn, be home alone, and then

40:04.960 --> 40:09.520
you strangled her.

40:09.560 --> 40:12.720
<i>You strangled her with her</i> <i>own scarf to make it look like</i>

40:09.560 --> 40:12.720
<i>a random killing,</i>

40:12.760 --> 40:16.640
<i>then arranged the murder scene</i> <i>to make it look like</i>

40:12.760 --> 40:16.640
<i>she disturbed a burglar.</i>

40:20.960 --> 40:26.280
Janice Palmer told us the scarf that was used to kill her sister

40:20.960 --> 40:26.280
had recently gone missing.

40:26.320 --> 40:30.040
We've, er, just spoken to Janice Palmer again.

40:30.080 --> 40:33.440
She told us that you unloaded their bags here at the villa

40:33.480 --> 40:35.160
after picking them up at the airport.

40:37.600 --> 40:40.480
<i>I suppose that must've been</i> <i>when you stole the scarf.</i>

40:40.520 --> 40:44.240
Scarf? I didn't even know she had a scarf!

40:44.280 --> 40:49.080
How do you account for the fact that your ex-fiancee, Lily Shaw,

40:49.120 --> 40:52.800
found the exact same scarf in your wardrobe?

40:52.840 --> 40:57.360
<i>She assumed it was a gift</i> <i>for your new love,</i>

40:52.840 --> 40:57.360
<i>an older woman.</i>

40:57.400 --> 41:01.400
It was for an older woman, wasn't it? It was for

40:57.400 --> 41:01.400
June Anderson.

41:04.640 --> 41:08.440
The oily fingerprint found on the scarf is Lily's.

41:04.640 --> 41:08.440
We've just matched them.

41:08.480 --> 41:10.880
It was bicycle oil on the scarf,

41:10.920 --> 41:12.440
proving it was the one she handled and

41:12.480 --> 41:14.920
proving it was the one she found

41:12.480 --> 41:14.920
in your wardrobe.

41:14.960 --> 41:19.160
You're forgetting that I was laid up in bed

41:14.960 --> 41:19.160
with food poisoning.

41:19.200 --> 41:22.200
-Yes. We both were.

41:22.240 --> 41:26.600
Of course. The food poisoning from the swordfish

41:22.240 --> 41:26.600
Estelle prepared for you?

41:26.640 --> 41:30.080
You didn't know that Estelle had stolen some fish from your bin.

41:30.120 --> 41:32.280
It's not stealing if it's in the bin!

41:32.320 --> 41:38.040
You didn't know that Estelle recycled some fish from

41:32.320 --> 41:38.040
your bin, gave it to her cat.

41:38.080 --> 41:40.640
She told us the cat died soon after.

41:40.680 --> 41:45.680
After performing an exhumation earlier today, we sent the poor

41:40.680 --> 41:45.680
lamented Opal for an autopsy.

41:45.720 --> 41:49.720
Her body contained a lethal level of Allamandin,

41:49.760 --> 41:52.400
a toxin from the Allamanda plant,

41:52.440 --> 41:56.280
which grows at the appropriately named Allamanda Retreat.

41:56.320 --> 41:58.160
You killed my cat?

41:58.200 --> 42:00.520
It was a dose high enough to kill a cat,

42:00.560 --> 42:04.920
but in a human it would simply induce symptoms

42:00.560 --> 42:04.920
similar to food poisoning.

42:04.960 --> 42:08.640
Ronnie must've added the Allamanda to your fish,

42:04.960 --> 42:08.640
Will, before serving it to you.

42:08.680 --> 42:11.080
But, Ronnie, your symptoms were faked.

42:11.120 --> 42:12.720
You can't prove that.

42:12.760 --> 42:15.640
Really? I think a simple blood test, once we're done here,

42:15.680 --> 42:20.120
will show traces of allamandin in Will's blood stream

42:15.680 --> 42:20.120
and none in yours.

42:20.160 --> 42:23.440
With Will sick in bed, it allowed you

42:20.160 --> 42:23.440
to leave your apartment.

42:23.480 --> 42:27.160
You came up here to Eagle's Edge, crept up

42:23.480 --> 42:27.160
behind June Anderson,

42:27.200 --> 42:29.600
<i>took out the scarf</i> <i>you'd stolen from her</i>

42:29.640 --> 42:31.800
<i>and squeezed</i> <i>the life out of her.</i>

42:33.440 --> 42:35.240
Fidel, read him his rights.

42:37.200 --> 42:38.240
Is this true?

42:39.360 --> 42:41.520
You killed her?

42:41.560 --> 42:44.560
-I'm not saying anything

42:41.560 --> 42:44.560
without a lawyer.

42:50.160 --> 42:52.640
You know, if you tell me the truth, I can help you.

42:57.480 --> 42:59.280
OK, sir,

42:59.320 --> 43:01.240
if you'd like to check the list,

43:01.280 --> 43:03.480
confirm all your possessions are accounted for

43:03.520 --> 43:05.080
and sign the bottom.

43:15.080 --> 43:17.440
Hey, Chief, look at this.

43:17.480 --> 43:18.880
Do you think he's a gambler?

43:24.240 --> 43:27.560
Get me details of where this was issued.

43:24.240 --> 43:27.560
It'll be in Manchester.

43:27.600 --> 43:30.560
-Take a closer look.

43:35.920 --> 43:37.360
DOUG: Dicky boy!

43:38.720 --> 43:40.280
I just heard!

43:40.320 --> 43:43.440
You got him. Bloody well done!

43:43.480 --> 43:45.320
There's still a way to go, but...

43:45.360 --> 43:47.360
But it's definitely him, yes?

43:47.400 --> 43:51.160
The evidence is irrefutable. Ronnie Stuart killed your wife.

43:51.200 --> 43:52.880
So, bang to rights, then?

43:52.920 --> 43:53.960
Absolutely.

43:55.680 --> 43:57.040
Is he in there?

43:57.080 --> 44:00.280
Yes, yes. But, er, don't worry, he's not going anywhere.

44:00.320 --> 44:02.040
He's in a cell.

44:02.080 --> 44:04.640
He's asked me for a few things. I'll go and get them.

44:04.680 --> 44:05.920
All right, Fidel.

44:07.000 --> 44:08.320
Listen, erm...

44:10.080 --> 44:14.320
I know we've had our differences, Dicky,

44:10.080 --> 44:14.320
but good work.

44:14.360 --> 44:19.320
You got there in the end. I just wish I could, erm,

44:14.360 --> 44:19.320
you know...

44:20.280 --> 44:22.840
Copper to copper,

44:22.880 --> 44:25.360
-That's not how

44:22.880 --> 44:25.360
we do things here.

44:25.400 --> 44:27.120
-He murdered my June. -Even so...

44:27.160 --> 44:30.000
If you had a wife, you would know how I feel.

44:35.560 --> 44:38.200
I'm sorry, I can't.

44:38.240 --> 44:40.080
I won't sanction that.

44:40.120 --> 44:41.240
We should go.

45:03.600 --> 45:05.040
Now, I don't have a wife,

45:05.920 --> 45:07.320
but I have a sister...

45:10.160 --> 45:11.520
Five minutes.

45:36.680 --> 45:39.520
-You really screwed this up. -It wasn't my fault!

45:39.560 --> 45:41.880
Yes, well, you got sloppy, letting them find the jewels.

45:41.920 --> 45:44.440
No! I am not doing this on my own!

45:44.480 --> 45:47.360
You're one of them. Have a word, get me off this.

45:47.400 --> 45:49.040
-It's not that easy. -I don't care.

45:49.080 --> 45:51.440
-We had a deal! -Not any more.

45:51.480 --> 45:55.320
You did mine and I'd do yours. We agreed.

45:55.360 --> 45:58.400
You killed Karen, Doug. You ran her over!

45:58.440 --> 46:02.000
Yes. And you got the money. The only difference is,

46:02.040 --> 46:05.280
-I wasn't stupid enough to get caught!

46:02.040 --> 46:05.280
-No, you...

46:05.320 --> 46:08.040
You've got to get me out of this.

46:08.080 --> 46:10.480
I'll tell them! When they come back,

46:08.080 --> 46:10.480
I'll tell them.

46:10.520 --> 46:13.000
You do, they'll find another body.

46:13.040 --> 46:14.760
I'll tell them, I swear.

46:14.800 --> 46:18.680
Those morons? Be my guest. They'll have a job proving it.

46:18.720 --> 46:20.560
Actually, I think we just have.

46:24.400 --> 46:25.800
DOUG: Get out of my way.

46:31.760 --> 46:35.040
Everyone thought I was mad to pursue you

46:31.760 --> 46:35.040
for your wife's murder,

46:35.080 --> 46:38.040
but the minute I saw the crime scene

46:35.080 --> 46:38.040
I knew it had to be you.

46:38.080 --> 46:40.400
Once we'd proved you couldn't have killed her in person,

46:40.440 --> 46:44.680
the obvious solution was that you put someone else

46:40.440 --> 46:44.680
up to the job. But who?

46:44.720 --> 46:47.640
And what could be the connection?

46:47.680 --> 46:48.920
And then I found it!

46:50.680 --> 46:53.120
An alcohol sobriety chip...

46:58.400 --> 47:02.440
Ronnie has been sober, with the help of a

46:58.400 --> 47:02.440
support group, for four years.

47:02.480 --> 47:06.120
But someone who has been less successful in recovery

47:02.480 --> 47:06.120
is you, Doug.

47:06.160 --> 47:08.320
In fact, when we worked together,

47:08.360 --> 47:12.360
-it was mandatory you attended AA meetings.

47:08.360 --> 47:12.360
-True.

47:12.400 --> 47:15.520
But there's still no way I killed my wife and you know it.

47:15.560 --> 47:16.840
But you didn't kill your wife.

47:17.840 --> 47:20.280
You killed Will Teague's.

47:20.320 --> 47:23.880
What

47:23.920 --> 47:28.440
Because someone else agreed to do the same for you.

47:28.480 --> 47:30.640
I think you met Ronnie at an

47:30.680 --> 47:33.800
alcohol recovery meeting in April last year, didn't you?

47:33.840 --> 47:36.160
At the Arnold Rehab Centre in Manchester.

47:36.200 --> 47:40.400
The same night that Will's wife refused Ronnie the money

47:36.200 --> 47:40.400
to save his business.

47:40.440 --> 47:43.240
I was nowhere near Manchester last April.

47:43.280 --> 47:45.560
Ah, but you were. We checked.

47:45.600 --> 47:48.880
You were at a conference. The 17th April.

47:48.920 --> 47:52.240
The same day Ronnie met with Will to ask for the money.

47:52.280 --> 47:54.560
One week later, Will's wife Karen was dead,

47:54.600 --> 47:56.880
run down by a stolen van.

47:56.920 --> 47:59.400
And there was an E-FIT of the driver.

47:59.440 --> 48:04.040
Yes, it didn't really strike any chords in the Manchester region,

47:59.440 --> 48:04.040
but here in Saint-Marie,

48:04.080 --> 48:06.640
we recognised a familiar face.

48:06.680 --> 48:10.880
Ronnie had a problem and, er, you told him you could

48:06.680 --> 48:10.880
help each other.

48:10.920 --> 48:16.080
You'd kill Karen Teague and he'd get the money from Will

48:10.920 --> 48:16.080
to save his business

48:16.120 --> 48:20.840
if, in return, he killed your wife here on Saint-Marie.

48:20.880 --> 48:24.840
There would be no connection. No way to link either of you

48:20.880 --> 48:24.840
with each other's crimes.

48:24.880 --> 48:27.840
And the local police force would never be a match for you.

48:27.880 --> 48:29.320
But we were.

48:29.360 --> 48:33.400
And my supposed motive for having June killed?

48:33.440 --> 48:37.560
-Money. -Wrong. All the money

48:33.440 --> 48:37.560
went to Janice.

48:37.600 --> 48:40.000
You married June for her money.

48:40.040 --> 48:43.440
But she kept tight control of it.

48:40.040 --> 48:43.440
Left you nothing in the will.

48:43.480 --> 48:47.600
-But she did have a sister. -Who dreamed of love, romance...

48:47.640 --> 48:49.720
Someone who had once been in love with you.

48:49.760 --> 48:54.120
After a suitable period of mourning, you could've

48:49.760 --> 48:54.120
made your move on Janice,

48:54.160 --> 48:55.360
got control of the money.

48:55.400 --> 48:58.240
Or maybe just organised another strangling...

48:59.760 --> 49:00.920
Nice case.

49:02.160 --> 49:04.480
But no court would convict on that

49:04.520 --> 49:08.400
and the word of some former drunk.

49:08.440 --> 49:13.560
Good work, but you've still got nothing, Dick.

49:15.680 --> 49:17.880
DOUG:<i> I don't care.</i> <i>We had a deal.</i>

49:17.920 --> 49:21.600
<i>You did mine and I do yours.</i> <i>We agreed.</i>

49:21.640 --> 49:25.360
<i>You killed Karen, Doug.</i> <i>Yes. And you got the money.</i>

49:30.120 --> 49:32.280
RICHARD: I'd say that's better than a confession.

49:34.800 --> 49:36.680
He can't help you now,

49:36.720 --> 49:39.080
but you can help yourself by telling us the truth.

49:45.280 --> 49:47.200
I'm sure that your conversation with Ronnie,

49:47.240 --> 49:50.880
coupled with his confession, will be ample to convict you.

49:50.920 --> 49:53.720
-In fact, I'd suggest you were...

49:50.920 --> 49:53.720
-Bang to rights.

49:55.480 --> 49:58.440
Doug Anderson, I am arresting you for the murder of

49:55.480 --> 49:58.440
Karen Teague

49:58.480 --> 50:01.600
and for conspiracy to kill your wife, June Anderson.

50:01.640 --> 50:02.640
Come on.

50:03.640 --> 50:05.240
It's funny, isn't it,

50:05.280 --> 50:07.080
all those days

50:07.120 --> 50:10.120
you were at the pub with the boys at lunchtime

50:07.120 --> 50:10.120
and I was in the office,

50:10.160 --> 50:13.560
do you know what Dick was doing? Reading.

50:13.600 --> 50:15.640
Past files. That's what put me onto you,

50:15.680 --> 50:19.160
the similarity to the Charles Tyburn murder.

50:19.200 --> 50:21.560
Good job I wasn't in the pub, wasn't it,

50:21.600 --> 50:23.320
or I'd never have known about that.

50:24.280 --> 50:25.520
Oh, and one more thing...

50:28.440 --> 50:30.320
My name is Richard.

50:37.800 --> 50:39.920
I think we've earned ourselves a drink,

50:37.800 --> 50:39.920
don't you?

50:51.560 --> 50:53.080
I know.

50:53.120 --> 50:55.560
I thought it might cheer up Estelle a bit, you know?

50:56.800 --> 50:58.720
Or at least get her off my back, anyway.

50:58.760 --> 51:00.240
What do you think?

51:00.280 --> 51:02.760
I think the further that thing stays away from me, the better.

51:03.440 --> 51:04.640
Spoil sport.

51:08.880 --> 51:11.720
So, you finally got Doug Anderson.

51:11.760 --> 51:13.240
How does it feel?

51:13.280 --> 51:16.880
Maybe for the first time in his life he got what he deserves.

51:16.920 --> 51:20.040
Go on, allow yourself a happy dance!

51:20.080 --> 51:23.280
A little cheer

51:23.320 --> 51:25.560
-Be a happy Richard. -Ah-ah!
