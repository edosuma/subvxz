WEBVTT

00:01.002 --> 00:02.921
<i>Previously on</i> Homeland...

00:03.004 --> 00:04.464
<i>- Maggie around?
- Uh, no.</i>

00:04.547 --> 00:07.467
Don't call her. She's--
she's talking to a lawyer.

00:07.550 --> 00:10.387
- About?
- Franny.

00:10.470 --> 00:12.972
You can't provide her with a
stable home, so we are going to.

00:13.056 --> 00:14.849
- Carrie.
- Stay the fuck away from my kid.

00:14.933 --> 00:17.811
Dante's missing.
I can't go, then.

00:17.894 --> 00:19.688
This can put the whole
operation at risk.

00:19.771 --> 00:22.774
Then I must plan
to never see you again.

00:23.983 --> 00:25.819
Simone. Simone.

00:25.902 --> 00:28.446
Mr. Allen is
in federal custody, Senator,

00:28.530 --> 00:31.408
charged with violations
of the Espionage Act.

00:31.491 --> 00:35.120
And he's talking. So far, he's
confirmed a devastating account

00:35.203 --> 00:37.455
of Russian interference
in our democratic process,

00:37.539 --> 00:39.833
including feeding you and
your committee a steady diet

00:39.916 --> 00:43.670
- of manipulated information.
- You've been played, Sam.

00:43.753 --> 00:45.463
- Sorry, can you help me?
- Sure.

00:45.547 --> 00:47.716
I need to pull my daughter out
a little early today.

00:47.799 --> 00:50.051
- Hey, sweetheart. You ready?
- Yeah.

00:50.135 --> 00:52.137
<i>- Hey, Dante?
- Yeah.</i>

00:52.220 --> 00:54.806
<i>Can I call you back
in, like, five minutes?</i>

00:54.889 --> 00:56.683
Yevgeny's here.
Lock down the hospital.

00:58.435 --> 01:00.437
Dante! Fuck.

01:02.063 --> 01:04.065
Hey, you need to go
back to class.

01:04.149 --> 01:06.443
- I love you, baby.
I'll see you after school.
- No, Mommy.

01:06.526 --> 01:08.486
- No, Mommy. No.
- No, I gotta go. I gotta go.

01:18.288 --> 01:20.457
Hey!

01:25.754 --> 01:29.257
What did you do?

01:37.640 --> 01:39.893
<i>He saved our lives.</i>

01:39.976 --> 01:41.436
<i>Yeah.</i>

01:41.519 --> 01:45.815
<i>What was his name?</i>

01:45.899 --> 01:49.444
<i>Carrie, you're not yourself.</i>

01:49.527 --> 01:52.071
<i>But you don't have
my condition.</i>

01:52.155 --> 01:54.532
<i>I'm dealing with it.
I-I've been dealing with it</i>

01:54.616 --> 01:56.284
<i>since I was 22.</i>

01:57.952 --> 02:01.414
<i>She said no one at work
could know. She's bipolar.</i>

02:01.498 --> 02:05.210
<i>The mood of the country,
it's not great.</i>

02:05.293 --> 02:08.004
<i>Civil... war.</i>

02:08.087 --> 02:10.215
<i>Madam President, please!</i>

02:10.298 --> 02:13.092
<i>You have to put a stop to this!</i>

02:13.176 --> 02:15.345
<i>It's only getting worse.</i>

02:15.428 --> 02:17.347
<i>Is there no fucking line?</i>

02:17.430 --> 02:21.726
<i>Ridiculous lies
and accusations.</i>

02:24.562 --> 02:27.941
<i>The White House
is in crisis mode.</i>

02:28.024 --> 02:31.694
<i>I'm talking
about information warfare.</i>

02:31.778 --> 02:34.781
<i>Our country
is under attack.</i>

02:36.241 --> 02:39.661
<i>The time to rise up is now!</i>

02:41.287 --> 02:44.582
<i>I swore an oath
to protect it.</i>

02:46.876 --> 02:49.796
<i>Just think of me
as a light on the heavens,</i>

02:49.879 --> 02:54.592
<i>a beacon, steering you clear
of the wrongs.</i>

03:01.641 --> 03:05.061
You're doing great. Doc says
this is the last one, okay?

03:27.208 --> 03:30.128
You ready, Carrie?
We're gonna start prepping

03:30.211 --> 03:31.921
for your third
and final treatment.

03:32.005 --> 03:34.924
Same procedure as before.

03:35.008 --> 03:36.509
Let's get started.

03:36.593 --> 03:39.262
Today, we've got
a bilateral application

03:39.345 --> 03:43.057
with dexmedetomidine infusion
for her lithium at 2cc's

03:43.141 --> 03:46.311
and 5cc's of succinylcholine.

03:46.394 --> 03:49.022
So far, the patient's responded
well to the procedure,

03:49.105 --> 03:51.190
other than slight memory loss
immediately

03:51.274 --> 03:53.943
following the application.

04:06.122 --> 04:09.876
Just like before, okay?
Counting backwards from 100.

04:13.004 --> 04:16.132
100, 99,

04:16.215 --> 04:18.676
98...

04:18.760 --> 04:20.762
97...

04:20.845 --> 04:22.430
96...

04:24.599 --> 04:27.602
Ready for oxygen.

04:36.986 --> 04:40.198
Giving succinylcholine now.

04:46.788 --> 04:48.581
Vitals are normal.

04:50.166 --> 04:52.835
Current is good.
EEG is good.

04:53.628 --> 04:55.296
Everyone clear.

05:03.930 --> 05:05.181
Apply stimulus.

05:10.812 --> 05:12.981
Seizure induced.

05:29.414 --> 05:31.541
- Yeah, there you go.
- Mm-hmm.

05:34.419 --> 05:36.212
Something wrong, sir?

05:36.295 --> 05:40.091
The knot's fine.
Tie's too red.

05:40.174 --> 05:41.968
Maybe the wrong kind
of red.

05:45.179 --> 05:46.806
Sir, he's been downstairs
for half an hour.

05:46.889 --> 05:49.767
He's kept me waiting longer
than that more than once.

05:49.851 --> 05:53.688
They both have.
He can wait.

06:10.580 --> 06:13.875
- Sorry to keep you.
- Mr. Vice President.

06:13.958 --> 06:16.210
Want some coffee?
Something stronger?

06:16.294 --> 06:17.545
It's early,

06:17.628 --> 06:19.630
but Kyle can get you
whatever you like.

06:19.714 --> 06:21.007
I'm fine. Thank you.

06:21.090 --> 06:24.594
Ah. Please, sit.

06:26.095 --> 06:28.931
Am I mistaken, or is this
your first visit here?

06:29.015 --> 06:31.392
- Um, my first time.
- Ah.

06:31.476 --> 06:34.812
It was built
for the superintendent

06:34.896 --> 06:39.067
of the Naval Observatory
back in 1893...

06:39.150 --> 06:41.444
until the Chief
of Naval Operations

06:41.527 --> 06:45.114
decided he liked it so much,
he took it for himself.

06:45.198 --> 06:48.743
That rank has
its prerogatives.

06:48.826 --> 06:51.746
Mm.

06:51.829 --> 06:54.916
I'm usually the one
who's summoned.

06:54.999 --> 06:57.210
Something important
must be happening.

06:57.293 --> 06:59.170
Last night,

06:59.253 --> 07:02.799
the attorney general
called the president

07:02.882 --> 07:07.386
about a document Senator Paley
wanted the A.G. to sign.

07:07.470 --> 07:10.056
What kind of document?

07:10.139 --> 07:12.558
Invoking the 25th Amendment.

07:14.894 --> 07:15.978
Hmm.

07:16.062 --> 07:20.066
Declaring the president
unfit for office.

07:20.149 --> 07:23.027
The senator thinks enlisting
the president's cabinet

07:23.111 --> 07:26.197
will be easier than
getting Congress to impeach.

07:26.280 --> 07:30.827
He claims four members
have signed on already.

07:30.910 --> 07:33.955
Four short of
the majority required.

07:34.038 --> 07:36.290
Who are the four?

07:37.750 --> 07:39.752
Well, I was hoping
you could tell me.

07:39.836 --> 07:43.506
I wouldn't have asked
if I knew.

07:43.589 --> 07:47.051
So you, yourself,
haven't been approached?

07:47.135 --> 07:49.345
No. In fact, I was under
the assumption

07:49.428 --> 07:52.098
that Paley had eased off
once he saw the Russia file.

07:52.181 --> 07:57.311
He had. Dante Allen's death
put him back on the warpath.

07:57.395 --> 08:00.773
And how worried are we?

08:03.151 --> 08:04.902
Depends.

08:04.986 --> 08:07.488
On what?

08:07.572 --> 08:09.657
You, sir.

08:11.826 --> 08:14.829
Because Congress can't
ratify the 25th Amendment

08:14.912 --> 08:17.248
- without my signature.
- Correct.

08:17.331 --> 08:19.292
Even if he's got
a majority of the cabinet,

08:19.375 --> 08:23.254
Paley can't get this done
without you.

08:25.715 --> 08:27.884
Must gall her,

08:27.967 --> 08:30.011
that the survival
of her presidency

08:30.094 --> 08:32.972
could come down to me.

08:33.055 --> 08:35.892
The president trusts
your judgment.

08:35.975 --> 08:37.101
Trusts my judgment?

08:37.185 --> 08:38.978
That's a very generous
interpretation

08:39.061 --> 08:40.271
of our relationship.

08:40.354 --> 08:42.899
You're being a little
sensitive, aren't you?

08:42.982 --> 08:45.026
Maybe.

08:45.109 --> 08:47.904
Still, I can't remember
one time she demonstrated

08:47.987 --> 08:52.450
any real interest in my opinion
or solicited my advice.

08:52.533 --> 08:55.244
But I took an oath

08:55.328 --> 08:57.830
to defend this country
against all enemies,

08:57.914 --> 09:00.458
foreign and domestic.

09:00.541 --> 09:02.793
And I won't let
the president's indifference

09:02.877 --> 09:04.795
interfere with that.

09:04.879 --> 09:07.548
So...

09:07.632 --> 09:10.593
you tell her she's got
nothing to worry about,

09:10.676 --> 09:12.762
at least not from me.

09:12.845 --> 09:14.805
- Thank you, sir.
- Mm.

09:14.889 --> 09:16.974
- She'll appreciate it.
- Mm-hmm.

09:45.419 --> 09:47.588
Saul, quickly.

09:49.840 --> 09:51.300
Thanks for coming.

09:51.384 --> 09:54.011
I couldn't think of another
excuse to get out of the house.

09:54.095 --> 09:55.513
He thinks I've been subbing
all this time

09:55.596 --> 09:57.139
for another professor
out with the flu.

09:57.223 --> 09:59.433
- Please, sit.
- Yeah.

10:03.312 --> 10:05.815
So I couldn't get those damn
flight logs out of my head.

10:05.898 --> 10:08.317
- What about 'em?
- Two private aircraft booked

10:08.401 --> 10:12.655
out of the same private airfield
within 24 hours of each other?

10:12.738 --> 10:14.240
Tail numbers
on both planes blocked

10:14.323 --> 10:17.201
by an identical
onboard system.

10:17.285 --> 10:20.538
Let's just say the timing
of Dante's murder

10:20.621 --> 10:24.083
puts Yevgeny
on the second flight.

10:24.166 --> 10:26.210
Question is, who's on
the first flight?

10:26.294 --> 10:28.879
Could be anybody
in his network.

10:28.963 --> 10:30.214
Or Simone.

10:30.298 --> 10:33.009
Simone's at the bottom
of a lake somewhere.

10:33.092 --> 10:36.137
What if she isn't?

10:38.097 --> 10:39.390
If Yevgeny was gonna
kill her,

10:39.473 --> 10:42.518
why not do it on the spot
like he did with Dante?

10:42.601 --> 10:45.646
No, Saul. He couldn't
leave her behind.

10:45.730 --> 10:47.481
It's a love story.

10:49.775 --> 10:51.986
It's always a love story
with you.

10:52.069 --> 10:55.072
11 years ago, they were
both living in Paris.

10:55.156 --> 10:57.575
She, a doctoral candidate
at the Sorbonne.

10:57.658 --> 10:59.910
He, running a small group
of Western residencies

10:59.994 --> 11:02.496
- for the SVR.
- Still, you can't...

11:02.580 --> 11:06.250
you can't be sure the young spy
met the young graduate student.

11:06.334 --> 11:07.585
Actually, I can.

11:07.668 --> 11:09.253
Simone's thesis advisor
at the time

11:09.337 --> 11:11.589
has a vivid memory
of her boyfriend--

11:11.672 --> 11:14.717
tall, dark, and Russian.

11:27.646 --> 11:30.733
- You good?
- I'm good.

11:34.612 --> 11:36.864
- Your lawyer's here.
- Oh, thanks.

11:39.158 --> 11:40.576
Morning.

11:40.659 --> 11:43.621
- Hey, Rhonda.
- You said there was news.

11:43.704 --> 11:45.539
There is.

11:47.166 --> 11:48.918
There's an offer
on the table.

11:49.001 --> 11:50.544
Tell me.

11:50.628 --> 11:53.506
Your sister's agreed to
a visitation schedule.

11:53.589 --> 11:55.174
Every third weekend
at first,

11:55.257 --> 11:59.428
moving to alternating weekends
after a probationary period.

11:59.512 --> 12:02.264
Okay. Uh...

12:02.348 --> 12:05.017
This is a giant step forward,
Carrie.

12:05.101 --> 12:06.394
It means that
you're guaranteed

12:06.477 --> 12:08.729
to see your daughter
every month.

12:08.813 --> 12:10.648
That wasn't the case
yesterday.

12:12.650 --> 12:14.318
This is assuming
Maggie and Bill win

12:14.402 --> 12:17.196
- the custody hearing tomorrow.
- No.

12:17.279 --> 12:20.658
This is
in lieu of the hearing.

12:20.741 --> 12:25.204
I-I don't...
I don't understand.

12:25.287 --> 12:27.998
It's an agreement
between parties

12:28.082 --> 12:31.544
in exchange for signing over
sole physical custody.

12:34.046 --> 12:36.424
Me signing over custody
to them.

12:37.925 --> 12:40.010
Yes.

12:42.805 --> 12:45.808
And no hearing?
I don't even get a chance

12:45.891 --> 12:47.309
to argue my side
in front of a judge?

12:47.393 --> 12:50.146
Carrie, I think your sister
wants to avoid

12:50.229 --> 12:52.314
a protracted legal battle,

12:52.398 --> 12:55.609
which will be hard
on everyone.

12:55.693 --> 12:59.196
Right now,
that gives you leverage.

12:59.280 --> 13:01.115
After the hearing,
not so much.

13:04.785 --> 13:07.371
If they want Franny, I'm not
just gonna hand her over.

13:07.455 --> 13:10.833
They're gonna have to
take her from me.

13:10.916 --> 13:13.836
I thought
you understood that.

13:13.919 --> 13:15.463
As long as you understand,

13:15.546 --> 13:19.884
if the court awards Maggie
and Bill sole custody tomorrow,

13:19.967 --> 13:22.678
even temporarily,
you stand to lose

13:22.761 --> 13:26.474
any and all access
to your daughter.

13:30.311 --> 13:32.188
Is that what you think's
gonna happen?

13:36.108 --> 13:38.027
I really don't know.

13:38.110 --> 13:40.821
In your professional
opinion, then.

13:40.905 --> 13:42.448
Look, I've done this
long enough

13:42.531 --> 13:46.577
to tell you that there are
no certain outcomes.

13:46.660 --> 13:48.287
But you said courts
bend over backwards

13:48.370 --> 13:50.456
to keep children
with their parents.

13:50.539 --> 13:53.334
Yes. They do.

13:53.417 --> 13:56.629
Come on, Rhonda. Quit hedging.
Tell me what you think.

13:58.172 --> 14:00.883
I think you should seriously
consider the merits

14:00.966 --> 14:03.260
of the visitation offer.

14:14.188 --> 14:16.106
As most of you know,

14:16.190 --> 14:19.902
my ex-husband was
an anthropologist.

14:19.985 --> 14:22.613
About politics, he used to say,

14:22.696 --> 14:26.116
mankind was not descended
from peaceful arboreal apes

14:26.200 --> 14:30.120
but from a cruder, earthbound
type who hunted in packs

14:30.204 --> 14:33.791
and crushed the skulls
of his prey with gloves.

14:39.171 --> 14:42.883
Ladies and gentlemen...

14:42.967 --> 14:46.136
we are under attack,

14:46.220 --> 14:50.140
as radical as it sounds.

14:50.224 --> 14:55.437
Senator Paley must now be
considered a witting participant

14:55.521 --> 14:59.525
in a massive
Russian influence operation,

14:59.608 --> 15:02.945
designed to paralyze
our democracy

15:03.028 --> 15:07.032
and to diminish our role
on the world stage.

15:07.116 --> 15:11.203
If you don't believe it,

15:11.287 --> 15:15.666
and I gather that
some of you don't,

15:15.749 --> 15:17.835
ask yourself this--

15:17.918 --> 15:22.673
what of the people's business
have we, any of us,

15:22.756 --> 15:27.428
managed to get done
in the first 100 days?

15:27.511 --> 15:32.516
All our high hopes
in pieces on the ground.

15:32.600 --> 15:36.645
If there was ever a moment
to stand together,

15:36.729 --> 15:38.939
it is now.

15:42.901 --> 15:46.155
So...

15:46.238 --> 15:48.490
the next time the good senator
comes calling

15:48.574 --> 15:53.537
with his schemes
of invoking the 25th...

15:53.621 --> 15:56.624
and he will come calling,

15:56.707 --> 15:59.209
know two things.

15:59.293 --> 16:03.047
One, that there is no daylight
between me

16:03.130 --> 16:05.466
and the vice president
on this matter.

16:05.549 --> 16:08.552
None.

16:08.636 --> 16:10.846
And two...

16:10.929 --> 16:12.765
feel free to
beat his head in with a club.

16:16.727 --> 16:19.313
- Okay. Are we ready?
- Yes, Madam President.

16:19.396 --> 16:23.192
- Yes, Madam President.
- Let's get into character, then.

16:27.154 --> 16:29.948
- Madam President...
- Madam President...

16:30.032 --> 16:32.368
- Madam President...
- Thank you.

16:32.451 --> 16:34.953
You'll come
through this, Madam President.

16:35.037 --> 16:38.749
With your help, I will.

16:38.832 --> 16:40.000
Good morning.

16:40.084 --> 16:44.505
Doesn't sound
like Rhonda's exactly...

16:44.588 --> 16:47.466
brimming with confidence.

16:47.549 --> 16:51.762
Well, she's a lawyer. She wants
to prepare me for the worst.

16:51.845 --> 16:53.222
And?

16:53.305 --> 16:56.266
Are you? Prepared?

16:57.935 --> 17:00.562
I don't think you are,
Carrie.

17:00.646 --> 17:03.565
You're in a knife fight
without a knife.

17:03.649 --> 17:06.068
- Well, what do you suggest?
- I don't know.

17:06.151 --> 17:09.363
Maybe a little
opposition research?

17:09.446 --> 17:12.783
- On my sister?
- Or her husband?

17:16.412 --> 17:19.456
I'm sensing some moral confusion
here. Should I shut up?

17:19.540 --> 17:22.710
No, not at all. I-I was just
wondering what kind of dirt

17:22.793 --> 17:24.712
you could actually dig up
on those two.

17:24.795 --> 17:26.505
Well, you tell <i>me.</i>

17:29.466 --> 17:31.427
What,
Supermom and St. Bill?

17:31.510 --> 17:33.429
It's not exactly
a laundry list.

17:33.512 --> 17:36.598
Come on, Carrie.
Everybody has something.

17:37.850 --> 17:40.269
- Well...
- What?

17:43.397 --> 17:46.316
She was my unofficial doctor
for years,

17:46.400 --> 17:47.776
treated me under an alias,

17:47.860 --> 17:50.320
ran my blood tests,
wrote my lithium prescriptions.

17:50.404 --> 17:52.030
To avoid you getting
flagged by the agency?

17:52.114 --> 17:53.657
Yep.

17:53.741 --> 17:57.202
Well...

17:57.286 --> 17:59.747
That's her medical license
right there.

18:11.842 --> 18:13.010
Good to go?

18:13.093 --> 18:15.471
Moscow's on
the secure uplink, sir.

18:17.431 --> 18:20.684
- Talk to me.
<i>- Good morning, Saul.</i>

18:20.768 --> 18:22.644
This is crap, Jim.

18:22.728 --> 18:24.438
It's been over a week.

18:24.521 --> 18:26.106
It's fuckin' amateur hour.

18:26.190 --> 18:29.193
<i>Well, to be fair,
finding Yevgeny</i>

18:29.276 --> 18:31.820
<i>was only made
a priority yesterday.</i>

18:31.904 --> 18:35.032
If I didn't know better,
I'd say I'm being slow-rolled.

18:35.115 --> 18:38.160
Am I being
slow-rolled, Jim?

18:38.243 --> 18:39.828
<i>The long answer is</i>

18:39.912 --> 18:41.747
<i>the president hasn't
exactly banked</i>

18:41.830 --> 18:44.708
<i>a whole lot
of goodwill with HQ.</i>

18:44.792 --> 18:47.961
- What's that supposed to mean?
<i>- Well, after what she said
during the campaign,</i>

18:48.045 --> 18:50.672
<i>nobody on the seventh floor
is much in the mood</i>

18:50.756 --> 18:52.174
<i>to throw her a lifeline.</i>

18:52.257 --> 18:53.967
Fuck them.

18:57.888 --> 19:00.724
<i>You don't seem happy, Saul.</i>

19:00.808 --> 19:03.560
<i>Is the president
really that vulnerable?</i>

19:03.644 --> 19:04.978
Yeah, she is.

19:05.062 --> 19:07.314
If we don't produce
some hard evidence

19:07.397 --> 19:09.483
that screams Russia,
and soon,

19:09.566 --> 19:12.444
I don't see her making it
to the end of the year,

19:12.528 --> 19:14.112
much less
the end of her term.

19:14.196 --> 19:15.906
<i>Tell me what to do.</i>

19:15.989 --> 19:19.409
Start by sending a team
to Sergiyev Posad.

19:19.493 --> 19:20.869
<i>Why there?</i>

19:20.953 --> 19:22.746
I hear it's a beautiful town.

19:22.830 --> 19:24.414
Plus, Yevgeny goes on and on
about it

19:24.498 --> 19:27.793
in a unpublished novel
he wrote at university.

19:27.876 --> 19:29.461
Describes
an idyllic summer there

19:29.545 --> 19:31.880
at a baronial dacha
on the river.

19:31.964 --> 19:34.174
<i>Shouldn't be hard to find,
if it exists.</i>

19:34.258 --> 19:36.093
In the novel, a rich uncle
on his mother's side

19:36.176 --> 19:38.053
- owns the place.
<i>- I'll have people there</i>

19:38.136 --> 19:41.098
<i>- first thing in the morning.</i>
- Good.

19:42.975 --> 19:45.602
Jim, while you're there,

19:45.686 --> 19:48.188
keep an eye out
for Simone Martin, too.

19:48.272 --> 19:50.399
I will.

19:50.482 --> 19:51.608
Good.

20:05.956 --> 20:08.792
- Can I come in?
- Of course.

20:08.876 --> 20:11.295
Saul, you didn't have to.
They're beautiful.

20:11.378 --> 20:14.923
Where do you want them?

20:17.009 --> 20:19.803
I was here on Monday.
You were sleeping.

20:19.887 --> 20:21.263
I didn't want
to disturb you.

20:21.346 --> 20:22.598
Yeah, Anson told me.

20:22.681 --> 20:24.641
How are you?

20:24.725 --> 20:27.227
Better. I'm much better.

20:27.311 --> 20:29.146
I'm starting a whole new
drug protocol.

20:29.229 --> 20:30.522
Is it true you also did

20:30.606 --> 20:32.733
another course of
electroconvulsive therapy?

20:32.816 --> 20:35.235
I did. I know they scare
the hell out of you,

20:35.319 --> 20:38.739
those treatments, but for me,
they're a miracle, really.

20:40.824 --> 20:44.745
What happened, Carrie?

20:44.828 --> 20:46.580
Can you tell me?

20:49.416 --> 20:52.502
Um, wh-what happened is...

20:52.586 --> 20:53.962
what always happens

20:54.046 --> 20:55.464
when I don't listen
to the people around me,

20:55.547 --> 20:59.176
when I think I can keep all
the plates spinning by myself.

20:59.259 --> 21:01.595
I swear, I should've
seen it coming.

21:01.678 --> 21:04.014
That makes two of us.

21:04.097 --> 21:06.975
No. In no way is this
your responsibility.

21:07.059 --> 21:08.769
I feel responsible.

21:08.852 --> 21:11.772
Don't. It was a complete
psychotic break.

21:11.855 --> 21:13.649
They had to hit me with
a massive dose of Haldol

21:13.732 --> 21:15.275
and take me away
in four-point restraints.

21:17.569 --> 21:19.905
Waking fucking nightmare.

21:21.448 --> 21:25.702
And now I'm in the middle

21:25.786 --> 21:28.538
of this ugly, ugly
custody battle with Maggie.

21:28.622 --> 21:29.957
Hearing's tomorrow, huh?

21:30.040 --> 21:33.794
- Yeah.
- What can I do?

21:37.255 --> 21:39.174
Nothing.

21:39.257 --> 21:41.259
Wish me luck.

21:41.343 --> 21:43.929
Good luck.

21:48.266 --> 21:52.354
Come on, Saul.
I-I appreciate the visit, but...

21:52.437 --> 21:54.648
why are you really here?

22:00.821 --> 22:02.906
Yevgeny slipped the net.

22:02.990 --> 22:04.574
Best guess is he made it
back to Russia.

22:04.658 --> 22:06.201
- Fuck.
- Yeah.

22:06.284 --> 22:08.412
There's also some institutional
resistance on our side

22:08.495 --> 22:10.872
to finding him,
if you can believe that.

22:10.956 --> 22:13.917
Oh, I believe it.
So what do you need?

22:14.001 --> 22:17.546
Next best thing to you,
Carrie-- people I can trust.

22:17.629 --> 22:20.799
- I need your team.
- To do what? Repatriate him?

22:20.882 --> 22:22.718
Him or Simone Martin.

22:22.801 --> 22:24.970
Turns out she might
be alive after all.

22:25.053 --> 22:27.514
Of the two of them,

22:27.597 --> 22:30.892
she'd be the easier
to exfiltrate.

22:30.976 --> 22:32.269
What's the time frame?

22:32.352 --> 22:33.979
Soon as we can locate
one or the other,

22:34.062 --> 22:36.231
which we're hoping happens
in the very near future.

22:36.314 --> 22:39.151
I'll reach out
right away, then.

22:39.234 --> 22:40.569
The boys will jump
at the chance.

22:40.652 --> 22:43.780
Who leads the team,
Anson or Bennet?

22:45.657 --> 22:47.951
That's a tough call.
Uh...

22:48.035 --> 22:52.748
Bennet's steady, but Anson
can think outside the box.

22:52.831 --> 22:57.127
Either one run an operation
in Eastern Europe before?

22:57.210 --> 22:59.546
Not that I know of.

23:02.132 --> 23:04.342
Really should be you,
Carrie.

23:06.511 --> 23:08.430
I can't.

23:08.513 --> 23:10.766
I'm talking about
in a purely supervisory role.

23:10.849 --> 23:12.434
Really, I-I can't.
I'm-I'm sorry.

23:12.517 --> 23:16.104
You'd be in the field
three days. Week at the most.

23:18.523 --> 23:20.609
It's not about days
or weeks, Saul.

23:20.692 --> 23:22.611
This is about
the rest of my life.

23:24.571 --> 23:26.198
Tomorrow, I walk
into a courtroom

23:26.281 --> 23:29.493
to fight for my daughter.

23:29.576 --> 23:31.036
If I'm ever gonna
convince anybody

23:31.119 --> 23:32.287
I deserve a second chance,

23:32.370 --> 23:34.915
first,
I have to convince myself.

23:34.998 --> 23:38.668
That means putting the job
behind me once and for all.

23:38.752 --> 23:42.047
You tried that before.
Didn't work.

23:43.423 --> 23:45.550
It will this time.

23:58.772 --> 24:01.233
- James.
- Good to see you.

24:07.864 --> 24:11.118
- Mr. Vice President.
- Sir.

24:13.578 --> 24:17.040
You asked me to review
the defense budget

24:17.124 --> 24:18.625
over a working dinner.

24:18.708 --> 24:20.293
Last I checked,

24:20.377 --> 24:23.255
the senator wasn't on
the Appropriations Committee.

24:25.090 --> 24:28.009
You're wasting your time, Sam.
Whatever differences

24:28.093 --> 24:30.137
I may have with the president
are overstated.

24:30.220 --> 24:33.348
Look, none of us
wants to be here,

24:33.431 --> 24:37.185
but it's on all of us to hold
that woman accountable.

24:37.269 --> 24:39.896
You know, your indignation
might be more convincing

24:39.980 --> 24:41.857
if it weren't
quite so covered in crap.

24:41.940 --> 24:44.276
Crap? You mean like, uh,
this, uh,

24:44.359 --> 24:46.903
Russian bogeyman
she keeps talking about?

24:46.987 --> 24:50.532
Have you seen any evidence?
Any actual evidence?

24:50.615 --> 24:52.909
I've seen the same
intelligence you have.

24:52.993 --> 24:55.078
Right, those photographs
and timeline.

24:55.162 --> 24:58.915
It all looks real enough,
I'll give 'em that.

24:58.999 --> 25:03.420
I almost bought it myself until
that FBI agent turned up dead.

25:03.503 --> 25:05.839
Murdered
by Russian operatives.

25:05.922 --> 25:08.341
Dante Allen was
in federal custody,

25:08.425 --> 25:10.760
just like General McClendon,

25:10.844 --> 25:13.221
just like Simone Martin,

25:13.305 --> 25:15.015
Fool me once, shame on you.

25:15.098 --> 25:18.727
But... three times?

25:18.810 --> 25:23.773
The president is covering up
one crime with another.

25:23.857 --> 25:25.901
A majority of the cabinet
concurs.

25:29.321 --> 25:30.947
What are you talking about?

25:31.031 --> 25:34.201
Eight secretaries are ready
to sign a document, if you are.

25:36.119 --> 25:37.996
We gave her the chance
to step down

25:38.079 --> 25:41.750
and to do so with dignity,
but she refused.

25:44.920 --> 25:48.590
So that leaves you,
Mr. Vice President.

25:48.673 --> 25:50.425
Like it or not,

25:50.508 --> 25:53.553
it's up to you to end
this national nightmare.

25:57.849 --> 25:59.809
Please.

26:01.519 --> 26:05.148
At least hear us out.

26:05.232 --> 26:08.109
It's the most important decision
you'll ever make.

26:19.746 --> 26:21.957
Okay, what are
the classification parameters

26:22.040 --> 26:24.918
so I can sign off on them?

26:25.001 --> 26:28.546
No, consider it a go order
until you hear otherwise.

26:28.630 --> 26:30.715
And good luck.

26:30.799 --> 26:32.634
Saul Berenson.

26:32.717 --> 26:36.137
He's working a lead with
our station chief in Moscow.

26:36.221 --> 26:39.099
- Sounds promising.
- We'll see.

26:39.182 --> 26:41.309
So far, so good today.

26:44.646 --> 26:47.357
Nothing to worry about,
but I thought you should know--

26:47.440 --> 26:51.027
Senator Paley just reached out
to the vice president.

26:51.111 --> 26:52.737
No surprise there.

26:52.821 --> 26:55.949
Well, only that
it's taken this long.

26:56.032 --> 26:57.867
Warner had
a dinner scheduled

26:57.951 --> 27:02.664
with Secretary Mullen
in Georgetown.

27:02.747 --> 27:06.543
Paley ambushed him there.

27:06.626 --> 27:09.296
So... Mullen was in on it.

27:11.715 --> 27:13.842
Looks that way.

27:17.512 --> 27:20.015
He was sitting next to me
in the Cabinet Room,

27:20.098 --> 27:23.268
looked me right in the eye.

27:25.562 --> 27:30.066
Besides Mullen, who else
might be wavering?

27:30.150 --> 27:32.152
Warner find out?

27:32.235 --> 27:35.322
I actually haven't
spoken to him yet.

27:35.405 --> 27:37.115
So how do you know
this dinner happened?

27:37.198 --> 27:39.826
<i>Is</i> happening, right now.

27:39.909 --> 27:41.953
There's a bartender
at the restaurant

27:42.037 --> 27:45.165
I keep on retainer.

27:45.248 --> 27:47.417
How long have they been
in there?

27:47.500 --> 27:50.086
Over an hour.

27:52.047 --> 27:55.467
What the hell are they
talking about?

28:01.348 --> 28:03.391
Get me the vice president,
please.

28:03.475 --> 28:05.685
I wouldn't read too much
into this.

28:05.769 --> 28:07.896
I can't afford not to.

28:09.564 --> 28:12.400
Voicemail.

28:12.484 --> 28:14.944
Ralph?

28:15.028 --> 28:19.282
I know where you are,
and I know who you're with.

28:19.366 --> 28:21.701
Please call me back
when you get this.

28:24.579 --> 28:27.457
Elizabeth, you talked to him
this morning.

28:27.540 --> 28:28.875
Trust me, he's solid.

28:28.958 --> 28:33.630
I talked to Mullen, too,
and he lied to my face.

28:38.009 --> 28:40.261
I'll be here late tonight.

28:40.345 --> 28:42.680
Let me know
when he calls back.

29:00.281 --> 29:01.408
Hello?

29:01.491 --> 29:03.118
It's not here.

29:03.201 --> 29:04.577
- What?
<i>- The file.</i>

29:04.661 --> 29:07.163
There's no one by the name
of Jessica Field.

29:08.748 --> 29:09.999
Um...

29:10.083 --> 29:12.252
F-I-E-L-D.

29:12.335 --> 29:14.838
Nope. Nothing.

29:14.921 --> 29:16.714
You sure?

29:16.798 --> 29:20.635
Look, I'm looking at the F's
now-- Feddermen, Feld, Fuchs.

29:20.718 --> 29:22.720
- Maybe she shredded it?
<i>- Not Maggie.</i>

29:22.804 --> 29:25.890
- She keeps everything.
- Fraudulent prescriptions?

29:25.974 --> 29:27.267
<i>It wasn't
just prescriptions.</i>

29:27.350 --> 29:29.144
She monitored my dosages,
my blood work.

29:29.227 --> 29:30.645
It was an important
medical record.

29:30.728 --> 29:33.148
She wouldn't have
just tossed it.

29:36.192 --> 29:38.778
- Oh, wait.
- What?

29:38.862 --> 29:42.532
Fuck. It must be at home.
She has an office there, too.

29:42.615 --> 29:45.702
- Where?
- Above the garage.

29:45.785 --> 29:48.037
So what do you want me
to do?

29:48.121 --> 29:51.040
Is there an alarm?

29:51.124 --> 29:53.293
Yeah.

29:53.376 --> 29:55.253
<i>Do you know the code?</i>

29:58.131 --> 29:59.632
Yeah.

30:02.093 --> 30:04.846
So are you gonna
give it to me or what?

30:17.317 --> 30:20.278
Thank you.

30:21.905 --> 30:23.865
Olivia.

30:23.948 --> 30:28.661
- Didn't see you on the schedule.
- I asked her here myself.

30:32.081 --> 30:34.751
What's going on?

30:34.834 --> 30:37.587
Madam President, if you'd like
a minute alone with--

30:37.670 --> 30:39.255
What I need is for
my White House counsel

30:39.339 --> 30:41.216
to deliver these before
the vice president

30:41.299 --> 30:42.717
invokes the 25th.

30:42.800 --> 30:45.094
Before he does what?

30:45.178 --> 30:47.889
- What exactly did he tell you?
- Nothing.

30:47.972 --> 30:51.643
He didn't return my calls
last night or this morning.

30:51.726 --> 30:54.187
His office is saying
he is unreachable.

30:54.270 --> 30:56.606
Well, if-if he's
not returning your calls,

30:56.689 --> 30:58.566
- there must be a reason.
- Yeah, there is.

30:58.650 --> 31:00.485
He's thrown down
with Paley and Mullen.

31:00.568 --> 31:02.862
- You don't know that.
- Why do you doubt it?

31:02.946 --> 31:06.616
The plan is to deprive him of
the signatures Congress needs

31:06.699 --> 31:09.786
- to open debate.
- Deprive him? How?

31:09.869 --> 31:11.538
Let me see that.

31:17.877 --> 31:19.587
You're firing your cabinet.

31:19.671 --> 31:21.089
Only those who caved.

31:21.172 --> 31:25.009
Besides Mullen, you have
no idea who that is.

31:25.093 --> 31:28.513
Well, I can
damn well guess.

31:28.596 --> 31:30.807
The ones I didn't handpick.

31:30.890 --> 31:32.141
The ones
whose portfolios

31:32.225 --> 31:34.269
intersect with
National Security.

31:34.352 --> 31:35.770
Is this even legal?

31:35.853 --> 31:38.064
It's unprecedented,
but the law's clear.

31:38.147 --> 31:40.817
The president can dismiss
cabinet members at any time

31:40.900 --> 31:42.777
- for any reason.
- You do realize

31:42.860 --> 31:45.071
that you are playing
right into their hands.

31:45.154 --> 31:47.490
You don't think
I know that?

31:50.118 --> 31:52.328
Warner is
a human weather vane,

31:52.412 --> 31:54.872
- but Paley and Mullen...
- No, no, no, no, not them!

31:54.956 --> 31:56.541
- ...are smart as--
- The Russians!

31:56.624 --> 31:59.669
You are giving them
the very constitutional crisis

31:59.752 --> 32:02.130
they've been trying
to instigate for months.

32:02.213 --> 32:05.466
What choice do I have?
Wait any longer,

32:05.550 --> 32:08.261
and I could be removed
from office this afternoon!

32:08.344 --> 32:12.473
Temporarily. Even if Warner does
deliver those signatures,

32:12.557 --> 32:13.975
it's just the first round.

32:14.058 --> 32:16.978
He still needs Congress
to declare you unfit

32:17.061 --> 32:20.148
and by a two-thirds vote
in each house.

32:20.231 --> 32:22.650
If I let them march me
out of here today,

32:22.734 --> 32:24.861
they are never
letting me back in.

32:24.944 --> 32:29.240
The press will crucify you,
Elizabeth.

32:29.324 --> 32:31.868
Articles of impeachment
will be drafted.

32:31.951 --> 32:34.370
This will make
the Saturday Night Massacre

32:34.454 --> 32:36.873
look like a dress rehearsal
for the real thing.

32:36.956 --> 32:39.042
Please...

32:39.125 --> 32:40.960
I'm begging you.

32:42.420 --> 32:45.006
Reconsider.

32:53.931 --> 32:58.186
I did not bust my ass
to get elected.

32:58.269 --> 33:01.230
I did not survive
an assassination attempt

33:01.314 --> 33:06.361
just to fold up my tent
and go home.

33:06.444 --> 33:08.112
Send 'em.

33:20.667 --> 33:21.918
Don't.

34:06.379 --> 34:08.464
Hey. Carrie.

34:12.009 --> 34:13.136
Any issues?

34:13.219 --> 34:16.347
No. I got out
in five minutes.

34:16.431 --> 34:18.224
It's all there.

34:18.307 --> 34:19.559
Thanks.

34:19.642 --> 34:21.602
Good luck.

34:49.630 --> 34:52.175
Franny always loved
when Aunt Carrie was around--

34:52.258 --> 34:54.135
played with her,
fixed her breakfast.

34:54.218 --> 34:55.970
Stuff like that.

34:56.053 --> 34:58.598
Does your Aunt Carrie
spend a lot of time with Franny?

35:02.393 --> 35:03.770
Not really.

35:03.853 --> 35:06.314
Can you speak up, please?

35:07.815 --> 35:09.650
No.

35:09.734 --> 35:12.153
It always seems like Aunt Carrie
is going somewhere,

35:12.236 --> 35:15.948
and my mom couldn't
depend on her.

35:17.492 --> 35:21.037
Do you know what kept
her out of the house so much?

35:21.120 --> 35:25.374
I think she's trying
to save our democracy,

35:25.458 --> 35:27.376
which is a pretty good thing,
if you ask me.

35:29.086 --> 35:31.380
Josie,
have you noticed any changes

35:31.464 --> 35:34.967
in Franny recently?

35:36.427 --> 35:37.512
Some, yeah.

35:37.595 --> 35:40.598
Can you give the court
an example?

35:42.433 --> 35:46.020
She's gotten really quiet.
I've noticed that.

35:46.103 --> 35:47.730
Anything else?

35:48.981 --> 35:51.317
At night, she crawls
into bed with me.

35:55.655 --> 35:58.032
Most times,
she cries herself to sleep.

36:00.451 --> 36:04.914
It's a terrible situation.
Mr. Quinn was a close friend.

36:04.997 --> 36:08.751
He was homeless and suffered
from PTSD, so she took him in.

36:08.835 --> 36:11.671
It wasn't, uh, the wisest
decision on her part,

36:11.754 --> 36:14.715
but it was
an act of compassion.

36:14.799 --> 36:17.051
Unfortunately,
things got out of hand,

36:17.134 --> 36:18.553
and there was an incident.

36:18.636 --> 36:20.096
More than
an incident, correct?

36:20.179 --> 36:24.517
Didn't he hold Franny
hostage at gunpoint?

36:24.600 --> 36:27.895
According to Carrie, he thought
he was protecting her.

36:27.979 --> 36:32.608
Ms. Lonas, do you
think it's sometimes necessary

36:32.692 --> 36:36.487
to separate a child
from her parent?

36:36.571 --> 36:38.781
I hate to see it happen.

36:38.865 --> 36:40.241
Research has shown
that children

36:40.324 --> 36:42.910
suffer lifelong damage
when their bond

36:42.994 --> 36:47.123
with the primary caregiver
is broken.

36:47.206 --> 36:49.959
Is there any exception?

36:50.042 --> 36:54.589
Yes, when a child has
suffered repeated trauma.

36:57.008 --> 36:59.510
Apparently, she had been
in a man's house.

36:59.594 --> 37:01.220
Someone she called
Mommy's friend.

37:01.304 --> 37:05.725
Then she said some bad men
broke in. They had guns.

37:05.808 --> 37:08.394
They fought with Mommy
and her friend

37:08.477 --> 37:10.354
and took the friend away.

37:10.438 --> 37:11.731
She said
Mommy was screaming,

37:11.814 --> 37:13.900
and somebody
was screaming at her.

37:13.983 --> 37:16.193
We didn't press too hard
for details

37:16.277 --> 37:21.032
because it really agitated her
to talk about it.

37:21.115 --> 37:23.743
She would literally
start trembling.

37:23.826 --> 37:26.954
No more questions.

37:27.038 --> 37:29.206
The witness may step down.

37:29.290 --> 37:31.834
Our next witness is
Dr. Margaret Mathison.

37:44.472 --> 37:47.308
- Good morning, Dr. Mathison.
- Good morning.

37:47.391 --> 37:50.311
- You're Franny's aunt?
- Yes.

37:50.394 --> 37:53.189
And the sister of her mother,
Carrie Mathison.

37:53.272 --> 37:54.815
Yes.

37:54.899 --> 37:56.567
And you and your husband are
petitioning the court

37:56.651 --> 37:59.528
for sole physical custody
of your niece. Is that correct?

37:59.612 --> 38:01.197
- That's correct.
- You have a lot

38:01.280 --> 38:03.866
of experience taking care
of Franny, don't you?

38:03.950 --> 38:07.370
I've been taking care of her
on and off since she was born.

38:07.453 --> 38:09.705
And Franny lives with you now,
doesn't she?

38:09.789 --> 38:11.999
Yes, uh, Carrie and Franny
moved in with us

38:12.083 --> 38:13.834
about three months ago.

38:13.918 --> 38:16.045
Was that difficult
for you and your family?

38:16.128 --> 38:17.588
Not at first.

38:17.672 --> 38:21.676
Um, Josie's always loved her
Aunt Carrie, so she was happy.

38:21.759 --> 38:25.179
And Franny's a delight.
It was good to have them.

38:25.262 --> 38:26.681
But it didn't last.

38:26.764 --> 38:29.684
What happened,
Dr. Mathison?

38:29.767 --> 38:31.102
What always happens.

38:31.185 --> 38:34.522
Uh, Carrie became
obsessed with something,

38:34.605 --> 38:36.065
started staying out
all hours,

38:36.148 --> 38:38.359
forgetting to pick up
Franny from school.

38:38.442 --> 38:42.363
I found strangers in the house
at night in her bedroom.

38:42.446 --> 38:45.241
And she was racking up
thousands of dollars in debt

38:45.324 --> 38:48.077
on her credit cards
and lying about it.

38:48.160 --> 38:51.330
- Did you confront her?
- I did. Finally.

38:51.414 --> 38:53.916
At first,
she denied everything,

38:54.000 --> 38:55.918
and then she said she was
working on something

38:56.002 --> 38:58.421
but couldn't say what.
That's typical.

38:58.504 --> 39:00.131
And the whole time
in the middle of it all

39:00.214 --> 39:03.634
is this little girl, desperate
for her mother's attention.

39:03.718 --> 39:06.595
Was there something specific
that prompted you

39:06.679 --> 39:09.348
- to petition for custody?
- Definitely.

39:09.432 --> 39:11.684
It was the incident
Mrs. Shepherd was talking about.

39:11.767 --> 39:14.061
But what she didn't
tell you is that

39:14.145 --> 39:15.896
the man who was
arrested that night,

39:15.980 --> 39:19.150
he was an FBI agent who Carrie
suspected was dirty.

39:19.233 --> 39:21.861
- Dirty? How?
- I have no idea.

39:21.944 --> 39:25.948
But your point is, your sister
thought this was a bad guy,

39:26.032 --> 39:27.783
and, still, she allowed him
near her daughter?

39:27.867 --> 39:29.577
- Is that correct?
- It's worse than that.

39:29.660 --> 39:31.662
She deliberately
put Franny in harm's way

39:31.746 --> 39:35.583
in order to collect evidence
against him.

39:39.045 --> 39:41.464
Is that the only reason
you're petitioning for custody?

39:41.547 --> 39:43.883
No, there's more.

39:45.259 --> 39:46.469
Your Honor,
Dr. Mathison would

39:46.552 --> 39:47.887
like to read a statement
to the court.

39:47.970 --> 39:49.764
I'll allow it.

40:10.201 --> 40:13.079
Is it okay if I just
speak to her instead?

40:13.162 --> 40:14.705
I mean, directly,
is that okay?

40:14.789 --> 40:16.540
Yes, go ahead.

40:28.344 --> 40:31.430
Carrie, the last thing I wanna
do is take Franny away from you.

40:31.514 --> 40:32.973
- Then don't.
- Please don't interrupt

40:33.057 --> 40:34.266
the witness, Ms. Mathison.

40:34.350 --> 40:36.352
You'll get your chance
to respond.

40:39.814 --> 40:44.735
From the day you were born,
you've had a mind of your own.

40:44.819 --> 40:49.198
You never listened to anyone,
even when you were little.

40:49.281 --> 40:53.369
You used to wave at planes.
Remember?

40:53.452 --> 40:57.706
And I would say, "Who are you
waving at? They can't see you."

40:57.790 --> 41:02.044
But you would just
keep on waving.

41:02.128 --> 41:05.131
You were always so fearless,
too, my God.

41:08.050 --> 41:10.761
I hated you for that.

41:10.845 --> 41:14.431
Why was I scared
all the time?

41:14.515 --> 41:16.433
How come you got to be
the brave one?

41:16.517 --> 41:19.436
And Dad going around
to everyone,

41:19.520 --> 41:21.397
calling you
his little daredevil

41:21.480 --> 41:24.483
until I could scream.

41:28.237 --> 41:30.531
I am not...

41:32.241 --> 41:35.202
...extraordinary
like you, Carrie.

41:36.787 --> 41:39.790
I don't run CIA stations
in Afghanistan

41:39.874 --> 41:43.419
or disrupt terrorist plots
in Berlin.

41:43.502 --> 41:47.298
I don't advise the president
of the United States.

41:48.549 --> 41:53.220
My job doesn't require me
to risk my life.

41:53.304 --> 41:55.222
I'm not a hero.

41:57.558 --> 41:59.768
But as it turns out,

41:59.852 --> 42:03.939
safe has
its advantages, too.

42:04.023 --> 42:06.192
A family...

42:07.818 --> 42:11.280
A stable home life...

42:11.363 --> 42:15.492
These are the things that
I can offer Franny...

42:15.576 --> 42:17.953
things that you can't.

42:18.037 --> 42:19.622
It's a chance to be normal.

42:19.705 --> 42:23.792
No. I-- Maggie, that's what
I've decided, too.

42:25.377 --> 42:28.172
I have to give it up.
All of it. I swear.

42:28.255 --> 42:31.759
I'm seeing this
very clearly now.

42:31.842 --> 42:35.846
Carrie, you're my sister,
and I love you, I really do,

42:35.930 --> 42:38.933
but I don't believe you.

42:39.016 --> 42:41.602
In six weeks,
the ECT will wear off,

42:41.685 --> 42:44.230
and Saul will come knocking
with some new crisis,

42:44.313 --> 42:47.983
and the whole crazy orchestra
will start playing again.

42:52.488 --> 42:54.740
I'm sorry. I really am.

42:59.662 --> 43:02.039
That's all I have to say.

43:04.708 --> 43:06.669
Mr. Schroder?

43:06.752 --> 43:08.629
No more questions,
Your Honor.

43:08.712 --> 43:11.632
I think this would be
a good time for a short break.

43:11.715 --> 43:13.550
Court is adjourned
for 15 minutes.

43:21.225 --> 43:23.435
You okay?

43:23.519 --> 43:26.021
Yeah.

43:26.105 --> 43:28.857
Yeah, I'm just gonna-- I'm just
gonna sit here for a while,

43:28.941 --> 43:32.486
- if that's all right.
- Sure. Take your time.

44:17.489 --> 44:19.658
Talk to you for a second?

44:33.797 --> 44:36.592
Before you say anything,
and just so you know,

44:36.675 --> 44:38.594
I wanted to come see you
in the hospital.

44:38.677 --> 44:42.097
- I was advised not to.
- It's fine.

44:44.016 --> 44:47.978
Listen, is that visitation
agreement still on the table?

44:49.980 --> 44:51.690
What?

44:51.774 --> 44:54.068
If I sign over sole custody
to you and Bill,

44:54.151 --> 44:56.737
do I still get to see her
every third weekend?

44:58.113 --> 44:59.948
Of course.

45:02.076 --> 45:05.371
How about
every other weekend?

45:07.915 --> 45:10.292
I think we can make
that work, yeah.

45:13.712 --> 45:15.422
We should get the lawyers,
then.

45:15.506 --> 45:18.300
Oh, my God.
Are you sure about this?

45:18.384 --> 45:19.968
I am.

45:20.052 --> 45:22.262
- Carrie.
- Quick. Before I change my mind.

45:22.346 --> 45:24.807
Okay.

45:36.193 --> 45:39.154
<i>The White House has yet to
respond to what one source</i>

45:39.238 --> 45:41.615
<i>has characterized as
a major purge</i>

45:41.698 --> 45:43.117
<i>in the administration.</i>

45:43.200 --> 45:44.952
<i>According to that
unconfirmed report,</i>

45:45.035 --> 45:47.996
<i>President Keane will dismiss
at least four</i>

45:48.080 --> 45:51.542
<i>cabinet-level secretaries
effective today at 5:00 p.m.</i>

45:51.625 --> 45:54.002
<i>While three of the four
are unknown at this time,</i>

45:54.086 --> 45:55.963
<i>the source did name
Secretary of Defense</i>

45:56.046 --> 45:57.965
<i>Terry Mullen as one of
the potential...</i>

45:58.048 --> 45:59.967
- They're piling on.
<i>- ...to be dismissed.</i>

46:00.050 --> 46:01.760
And it's happening a lot
faster than I thought.

46:01.844 --> 46:03.303
<i>...are directly tied</i>

46:03.387 --> 46:05.305
<i>to Senator Sam Paley's
investigation...</i>

46:05.389 --> 46:07.558
The vice president is here.

46:07.641 --> 46:09.685
- He's asking to see you.
- Now?

46:09.768 --> 46:11.979
He's right outside.

46:12.062 --> 46:15.816
Well, if he's carrying
an olive branch,

46:15.899 --> 46:19.736
tell him he's a day late
and a dollar short.

46:19.820 --> 46:21.029
He won't say what he wants

46:21.113 --> 46:24.616
except that
he'll only talk to you.

46:24.700 --> 46:27.661
If you like,
I can get rid of him.

46:27.744 --> 46:32.082
No. Now I'm curious.

46:32.166 --> 46:35.461
Bring him in.

46:53.604 --> 46:55.105
Thank you, David.

46:59.860 --> 47:03.864
Madam President, when you
asked me to stand with you,

47:03.947 --> 47:07.034
I was grateful
for the opportunity.

47:07.117 --> 47:10.287
Whatever bad blood existed,
I was happy to put it behind us.

47:10.370 --> 47:12.289
- I truly was.
- Until you weren't.

47:12.372 --> 47:14.416
Until you let Paley
turn your head.

47:14.500 --> 47:18.128
- Well, you're wrong there.
- How do you mean?

47:18.212 --> 47:23.133
It's true. After I saw him,
I-I had some second thoughts.

47:23.217 --> 47:27.721
I... I found myself wanting
more time to think it through.

47:27.804 --> 47:30.682
Once I did, though,
I came down on your side.

47:34.436 --> 47:35.729
You mean...

47:37.814 --> 47:41.985
You signed no document
invoking the 25th Amendment?

47:42.069 --> 47:46.031
I have not, and I won't...

47:46.114 --> 47:49.409
on the one condition that you
immediately walk back the firing

47:49.493 --> 47:51.453
of Secretary Mullen
and the others.

47:51.537 --> 47:55.082
Power without authority
is tyranny.

47:55.165 --> 47:58.293
That's the line I'm trying
to keep you from crossing.

47:58.377 --> 48:00.796
Okay.

48:00.879 --> 48:03.090
Okay, what?

48:03.173 --> 48:08.011
What assurance can you give me
that if I rescind the firings,

48:08.095 --> 48:11.598
you won't just go ahead
and sign the document anyway?

48:11.682 --> 48:16.436
I guess you'll just
have to trust me.

48:18.438 --> 48:21.817
When you're one signature away
from sitting at this desk?

48:21.900 --> 48:25.112
After you ignored my phone calls
knowing full well

48:25.195 --> 48:28.448
- what I was going through?
- I needed the time I needed--

48:28.532 --> 48:32.327
time I knew you wouldn't allow
without browbeating me somehow

48:32.411 --> 48:33.996
into pledging my loyalty.

48:34.079 --> 48:37.624
Which, now, all of a sudden,
you're willing to do.

48:37.708 --> 48:41.878
In good faith, as long
as you do the right thing.

48:41.962 --> 48:43.839
I don't like being
dictated to.

48:43.922 --> 48:46.758
I'm defining the limits
of my support.

48:46.842 --> 48:49.553
There's a difference.

48:57.227 --> 48:58.854
Without a majority
of the cabinet,

48:58.937 --> 49:02.107
which you do not have
as of now,

49:02.190 --> 49:04.818
that document is invalid.

49:04.901 --> 49:08.196
You are pointing
an empty gun at my head.

49:08.280 --> 49:10.198
Before I came here,

49:10.282 --> 49:14.036
I spoke
to three separate lawyers.

49:14.119 --> 49:17.205
Each one confirmed that
firing close to a third

49:17.289 --> 49:20.125
of your cabinet
under these circumstances

49:20.208 --> 49:22.544
is probably unconstitutional.

49:22.628 --> 49:26.214
The White House counsel
doesn't share their opinion.

49:26.298 --> 49:30.052
I'm giving you a simple choice,
Madam President.

49:30.135 --> 49:32.429
Plunge this nation
into crisis

49:32.512 --> 49:35.474
or defend it
from its real enemies.

49:38.477 --> 49:40.020
Madam President--

49:40.103 --> 49:42.230
The answer is no.

49:47.069 --> 49:49.780
Then you leave me no choice
but to deliver

49:49.863 --> 49:52.240
to the president pro tempore
of the Senate

49:52.324 --> 49:56.787
and the Speaker of the House
a document declaring you

49:56.870 --> 50:00.123
unfit for the office
of the presidency.

50:06.129 --> 50:09.716
It doesn't have to be
such a snake pit, Elizabeth--

50:09.800 --> 50:11.843
the world.

50:13.470 --> 50:16.640
It really doesn't.

50:55.679 --> 50:58.765
- I miss the service?
- Just ended.

51:01.560 --> 51:03.186
What happened in court?

51:05.856 --> 51:08.775
Franny's gonna live
with Maggie and Bill.

51:08.859 --> 51:10.610
Sorry.

51:10.694 --> 51:13.447
I'm okay.

51:13.530 --> 51:14.948
Really?

51:15.031 --> 51:19.411
Yeah.
It's the right thing.

51:23.749 --> 51:26.293
Did you find Simone?

51:26.376 --> 51:28.920
At a dacha on the outskirts
of Moscow.

51:29.004 --> 51:32.174
Yevgeny's with her.
The clock's ticking.

51:32.257 --> 51:34.009
- What do you mean?
- Warner signed on

51:34.092 --> 51:36.595
- to the 25th Amendment.
- Fuck.

51:36.678 --> 51:39.306
- So Keane has to stand down?
- Not yet.

51:39.389 --> 51:42.976
She preemptively fired
four members of her cabinet.

51:43.059 --> 51:45.479
Warner's petitioning
the Supreme Court

51:45.562 --> 51:48.648
to rule on the legality
of her action.

51:48.732 --> 51:51.526
- So what's your plan?
- At my request,

51:51.610 --> 51:54.446
the president's demanded
immediate and high-level talks

51:54.529 --> 51:56.198
with my counterparts at

51:56.281 --> 51:58.366
the Russian
National Security Council.

51:58.450 --> 52:00.952
As the pretext for an operation
to grab Simone?

52:01.036 --> 52:03.830
Delegation leaves tonight.

52:07.125 --> 52:08.710
Is it too late?

52:08.794 --> 52:10.086
For?

52:10.170 --> 52:12.422
Me to join?
I think I could be useful.

52:12.506 --> 52:16.384
Fucking kidding? Can you
be ready in four hours?

52:16.468 --> 52:21.306
If I hustle.
Text me the details.

52:21.389 --> 52:26.186
I gotta say something
to Dante's parents first.

52:26.269 --> 52:28.688
- What do they know?
- Medical examiner found

52:28.772 --> 52:31.691
a congenital heart defect
that was never diagnosed.

52:53.964 --> 52:57.467
Here you go, sweetie.

53:08.311 --> 53:10.063
Hey.

53:10.146 --> 53:13.149
- Find your bag?
- Yeah. Yeah, I got it.

53:13.233 --> 53:16.403
- Hi, Mommy.
- Hi, sweetheart.

53:16.486 --> 53:19.906
- What kind of cookies are those?
- Chocolate chip.

53:19.990 --> 53:21.658
Mmm.
Did Aunt Maggie make 'em?

53:21.741 --> 53:24.619
No, she brought them
from the store.

53:31.084 --> 53:32.961
So, um...

53:36.673 --> 53:39.551
Sweetheart, you know how
Mommy goes away sometimes?

53:41.177 --> 53:45.265
And you stay
with Aunt Maggie, right?

53:45.348 --> 53:47.267
Are you going away?

53:47.350 --> 53:50.312
Yeah. Yeah,
I have to go to work.

53:50.395 --> 53:53.189
And while I'm gone,

53:53.273 --> 53:55.442
you're gonna live here
with Aunt Maggie

53:55.525 --> 53:58.820
and Josie and Uncle Bill
just like you have been.

53:58.904 --> 54:00.697
Where are you going?

54:02.324 --> 54:04.868
Um, I'm going to Europe.
Remember?

54:04.951 --> 54:07.287
- Where we used to live?
- Not really.

54:07.370 --> 54:11.124
I showed you on a map once.
Across the ocean.

54:11.207 --> 54:13.877
You showed me,
but I don't remember.

54:13.960 --> 54:17.047
Well, that's where
I'm goin'.

54:17.130 --> 54:20.008
Are you coming back?

54:22.886 --> 54:25.472
Of course I'm coming back.
I'm going to work,

54:25.555 --> 54:29.476
and I always come back
when my work's over, don't I?

54:29.559 --> 54:31.686
Hey, Franny.

54:31.770 --> 54:35.732
I always come back.

54:37.067 --> 54:41.321
And while she's gone, you and I
are going to what?

54:41.404 --> 54:43.448
Make pictures for her every day.

54:43.531 --> 54:47.160
- Are you?
- We are going to draw a picture

54:47.243 --> 54:48.912
of something
we've done that day.

54:48.995 --> 54:51.081
And then when Mommy comes home,

54:51.164 --> 54:52.874
we're gonna give her
all the pictures

54:52.958 --> 54:55.627
so she's going to know
what we've been up to. Right?

54:55.710 --> 54:57.712
- Right.
- That's an amazing idea.

54:57.796 --> 55:01.299
Did you think of that?
Ah. You're so smart.

55:01.383 --> 55:04.594
Come here. Give Mom a hug.

55:26.825 --> 55:29.244
Can I go play
with Josie now?

55:29.327 --> 55:32.580
Yeah, of course you can.

55:44.134 --> 55:46.219
She's going to be fine.

55:48.513 --> 55:52.434
Yeah, I know.

56:05.071 --> 56:07.115
Thank you.

56:08.616 --> 56:11.703
Come here.

56:18.585 --> 56:20.795
Now go.

56:22.338 --> 56:26.134
Go do what you were
born to do.

56:29.888 --> 56:31.306
Thank you.

56:31.389 --> 56:34.934
Stop saying that.

57:09.636 --> 57:12.806
- Ready?
- Yeah.
