WEBVTT

00:06.840 --> 00:10.278
STOP APOLOGIZING.
REALLY.

00:10.311 --> 00:11.579
I DIDN'T LIKE
THE SERMON ANYWAY.

00:13.181 --> 00:14.482
WELL, IT'S A GOOD LESSON.

00:14.515 --> 00:16.750
WE SHOULD PROBABLY DRIVE
TO CHURCH SEPARATELY.

00:16.784 --> 00:18.719
OKAY.

00:18.752 --> 00:21.389
OKAY, SO, UH,
I'M GONNA GO ON INSIDE.

00:21.422 --> 00:23.624
UH, IF YOU WANT TO HEAD ON
TO THE RESTAURANT

00:23.657 --> 00:25.259
AND I'LL, UH,
CATCH A RIDE BACK WITH --
NO, NO. NO.

00:25.293 --> 00:27.128
NO.

00:27.161 --> 00:29.330
I AM NOT GOING TO BRUNCH
WITH YOUR GRANDPARENTS

00:29.363 --> 00:31.699
WITHOUT YOU.

00:31.732 --> 00:33.101
MM-HMM.
LIKE YOUR MOTHER DOES?

00:37.171 --> 00:39.373
ANN, MY MOTHER LOVES YOU.

00:39.407 --> 00:41.342
NOW, THAT'S JUST --
THAT'S NOT TRUE.

00:41.375 --> 00:43.711
IT -- IT -- THE ONLY --
THE ONLY --

00:43.744 --> 00:45.846
ONLY THING YOU HAVE EVER DONE
THAT UPSET MY MOTHER WAS --

00:45.879 --> 00:49.083
WAS WHEN YOU TOLD HER SHE RINSED
THE DISHES OFF TOO MUCH

00:49.117 --> 00:50.684
BEFORE PUTTING THEM
IN THE DISHWASHER.

00:50.718 --> 00:53.721
AND I STILL HAVE NIGHTMARES
ABOUT THE LOOK THAT SHE GAVE ME.

00:53.754 --> 00:55.789
LISTEN, IT'S VERY SIMPLE.

00:55.823 --> 00:59.693
I'M N GOING TO BRUNCH
WITH YOUR FAMILY WITHOUT YOU,

00:59.727 --> 01:02.296
BY MYSELF -- NO.

01:02.330 --> 01:06.134
OKAY.
I GOT A BETTER IDEA.

01:06.167 --> 01:07.635
YOU'RE COMING IN WITH ME.

01:07.668 --> 01:10.171
WHAT? NO!

01:10.204 --> 01:12.740
YES. YES. YES.
YOU'RE NOT JUST GONNA WAIT HERE.
NO, I'LL CONTAMINATE
THE CRIME SCENE.

01:12.773 --> 01:17.245
BESIDES, IT'S TIME YOU MET
THE PEOPLE I WORK WITH ANYWAY.
OH, MY GOD.

01:17.278 --> 01:20.748
LOOK,
IF YOU DON'T COME INSIDE...
REALLY?

01:20.781 --> 01:22.350
TO AVOID SPENDING TIME
WITH THEM.

01:22.383 --> 01:23.617
YEAH, I AM DOING THAT.
THAT -- YES.

01:23.651 --> 01:25.219
THAT'S -- THAT'S EXACTLY
WHAT I'M DOING.

01:25.253 --> 01:26.787
ANN?

01:26.820 --> 01:28.689
DAVID?

01:34.595 --> 01:36.164
UH, OKAY.

01:36.197 --> 01:37.531
SO, UH, WHY DON'T YOU
JUST WAIT HERE

01:37.565 --> 01:39.400
WHILE I GET EVERYTHING READY
FOR THE CHIEF?

01:39.433 --> 01:40.434
YEAH.
OKAY.

01:40.468 --> 01:42.803
UH...

01:42.836 --> 01:44.772
UH, DETECTIVE SERGEANT
DAVID GABRIEL, MAJOR CRIMES.

01:44.805 --> 01:46.240
UH, SHE'S WITH ME, OKAY?

02:40.961 --> 02:42.430
YEAH, CHIEF.

02:45.899 --> 02:47.701
OKAY. YEAH.
ON SECOND FLOOR. OKAY.

02:49.903 --> 02:52.473
UH, JUST, UH, ONE SECOND.

02:54.475 --> 02:55.909
DETECTIVE GABRIEL.
CHIEF.

02:55.943 --> 03:00.381
WHAT DO WE KNOW?

03:00.414 --> 03:04.685
HE'S 41 YEARS OLD.

03:04.718 --> 03:07.388
I THINK
I SAID THAT RIGHT.

03:07.421 --> 03:08.989
SO, THAT'S WHAT?
CANCERS OF THE STOMACH?

03:09.022 --> 03:10.791
UH, COLON, INTESTINES...

03:10.824 --> 03:12.293
THAT SORT OF THING.

03:12.326 --> 03:14.562
DR. BRADY LIVES ALONE.

03:14.595 --> 03:16.630
HE'S UNMARRIED,
ORIGINALLY FROM FLORIDA.

03:16.664 --> 03:19.533
HE SHARES THIS OFFICE
WITH A DR. STEPHEN PARR,

03:19.567 --> 03:21.702
ALSO AN ONCOLOGIST

03:21.735 --> 03:23.904
SPECIALIZING IN CANCERS
OF THE HEAD AND NECK.

03:23.937 --> 03:26.840
CANCERS OF THE HEAD
AND NECK.

03:26.874 --> 03:28.942
I GUESS
THAT INCLUDES THYROIDS.

03:28.976 --> 03:31.279
IS YOUR FATHER
STILL STRUGGLING?

03:31.312 --> 03:32.846
YES, HE IS.

03:32.880 --> 03:34.915
UM, AND THE, UH, BODY
WAS FOUND BY?

03:34.948 --> 03:37.785
UH, BY A JANITOR
CLEANING THE INFUSION ROOM

03:37.818 --> 03:39.653
THIS MORNING AT 9:15 A.M.

03:39.687 --> 03:41.322
HE CALLED 911.
THEY CALLED US.

03:41.355 --> 03:44.024
OKAY. OH,

03:44.057 --> 03:47.528
OH. BOUTONNIERE.

03:47.561 --> 03:51.465
BEFORE WE WENT TO CHURCH.

03:51.499 --> 03:53.434
Provenza: DON'T WORRY.

03:53.467 --> 03:57.771
THEY'LL BE OPEN
NEXT SUNDAY, TOO.

03:57.805 --> 03:59.540
THAT DR. PARR,
WHO WAS OUR VICTIM'S PARTNER,

03:59.573 --> 04:01.675
IS ON HIS WAY IN.

04:01.709 --> 04:02.576
OKAY.
UH, CHIEF?

04:02.610 --> 04:03.911
MM

04:03.944 --> 04:05.946

04:34.475 --> 04:36.544
I'LL...WAIT HERE.

04:39.413 --> 04:40.914
BE RIGHT BACK.
YEAH.

04:48.956 --> 04:50.991
BLUNT-FORCE TRAUMA
TO THE HEAD.

04:51.024 --> 04:53.761
WHATEVER THE WEAPON WAS,
CHIEF,

04:53.794 --> 04:56.530
WE HAD PATROL LOOK AT THE GARAGE
AND THE DUMPSTERS.

04:56.564 --> 04:59.667
NO LUCK.

04:59.700 --> 05:02.102
OH, FOR HEAVEN'S SAKES.

05:02.135 --> 05:03.871
HE WAS BEATEN
AND STRANGLED?

05:03.904 --> 05:05.806
WITH THIS, CHIEF --
I.V. TUBING.

05:05.839 --> 05:08.476
MAKES A REALLY GOOD
GARROTE.
TIME OF DEATH?

05:08.509 --> 05:10.444
BETWEEN 6:00 AND 10:00 P.M.
LAST NIGHT, GIVE OR TAKE.

05:10.478 --> 05:13.013
THANK YOU, KENDALL.

05:13.046 --> 05:14.482
WHAT WAS A DOCTOR
DOING IN HERE

05:14.515 --> 05:16.116
IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT
ON A WEEKEND?

05:16.149 --> 05:18.819
WELL, HE ADMINISTERED, UH,
CHEMOTHERAPY ON SATURDAY, TOO.

05:18.852 --> 05:20.888
STAFF?
ONE NURSE, CHIEF.

05:20.921 --> 05:22.089
SHE SAYS SHE LEFT
EARLY YESTERDAY

05:22.122 --> 05:24.358
TO MEET HER SISTER
FOR DINNER.

05:24.392 --> 05:25.793
SECURITY CAMERAS?

05:25.826 --> 05:27.595
THEY ONLY RUN LIVE FEEDS.
NOTHING'S SAVED.

05:27.628 --> 05:29.763
SO THE KILLER COULD BE ANYONE.

05:29.797 --> 05:32.366
WE DON'T KNOW WHO.
DO WE KNOW WHY?

05:32.400 --> 05:35.102
WELL, MAYBE.

05:35.135 --> 05:37.505
AND ALL THEIR SHELVES
HAVE DRUG NAMES ON THEM,

05:37.538 --> 05:38.872
BUT THEY'RE EMPTY.

05:38.906 --> 05:41.041
CHIEF, SOME OF
THE MISSING MEDICATIONS

05:41.074 --> 05:42.910
ARE CHEMOTHERAPY AGENTS,

05:42.943 --> 05:44.812
BUT THEY ALSO HAVE MORPHINE,
HYDROCODONE,

05:44.845 --> 05:46.580
OXYCODONE, FENTANYL.

05:46.614 --> 05:47.915
OPIATES.

05:49.617 --> 05:51.619
Dr. Parr: I TOLD CHRIS
THIS WOULD HAPPEN.

05:51.652 --> 05:55.856
TOLD CHRIS
WHAT WOULD HAPPEN?

05:55.889 --> 05:57.491
WHOEVER KILLED HIM
PROBABLY DIDN'T EVEN LOOK

05:57.525 --> 05:58.859
TO SEE WHAT DRUGS
THEY WERE TAKING.

05:58.892 --> 06:01.995
OH, MY GOD.

06:02.029 --> 06:03.997
THIS IS THE KIND OF THING
THAT COULD RUIN OUR BUSINESS.

06:04.031 --> 06:05.866
YOU CONSIDER TREATING CANCER
A BUSINESS?

06:05.899 --> 06:09.637
I'M SORRY.
DO YOU WEAR THAT BADGE FOR FREE?

06:09.670 --> 06:13.106
YES. TREATING CANCER PATIENTS
IS HOW I MAKE MY LIVING.

06:13.140 --> 06:15.843
AND WHEN PEOPLE CHOOSE ME,
HOPING THAT I CAN CURE THEM,

06:15.876 --> 06:17.778
AND THEY HAVE TO SIT
IN THIS WAITING ROOM

06:17.811 --> 06:19.713
NEXT TO SOME STREET PERSON
WHO'S JUST PISSED HIS PANTS

06:19.747 --> 06:21.515
BECAUSE HE'S TOO HIGH
TO REMEMBER

06:21.549 --> 06:22.783
TO GET UP TO GO TO THE BATHROOM,
THAT'S BAD.

06:22.816 --> 06:24.652
ALSO BAD?

06:24.685 --> 06:27.921
PEOPLE COMING IN
FOR CHEMO TOMORROW,

06:27.955 --> 06:30.458
OKAY. UH, LET'S START
AT THE BEGINNING.

06:30.491 --> 06:32.726
ACCORDING TO DR. BRADY'S
PHONE RECORDS,

06:32.760 --> 06:35.929
HE HAD ONE PERSONAL APPOINTMENT
AROUND THE TIME OF THE MURDER,

06:35.963 --> 06:36.930
A "W. SANDERS"?

06:36.964 --> 06:38.499
WALLY.
WALLY SANDERS.

06:38.532 --> 06:41.101
ONE OF CHRIS'
WHOLESALE DRUG SUPPLIERS.

06:41.134 --> 06:43.571
OKAY, UH,
WE'LL TRACK DOWN MR. SANDERS.

06:43.604 --> 06:47.174
NOW, ALL I NEED FROM YOU

06:47.207 --> 06:48.876
I CAN'T GIVE YOU THAT.

06:48.909 --> 06:50.143
WHY NOT?

06:50.177 --> 06:51.211
HIPAA, DAVID.

06:51.244 --> 06:54.515
EXCUSE ME?
HIP-- HIPAA.

06:54.548 --> 06:57.618
UM, HEALTH INSURANCE PORTABILITY
AND ACCOUNTABILITY ACT.

06:57.651 --> 06:59.620
IT SEVERELY RESTRICTS
PATIENT RECORDS, BUT IF YOU --

06:59.653 --> 07:01.822
UH. SO SORRY.
ONE SECOND.

07:01.855 --> 07:04.492
UM, DAVID?
YEP.

07:04.525 --> 07:06.226
IS

07:06.259 --> 07:10.197
UH, NO. NOT YET.
SHE'S STUDYING TO TAKE THE BAR.
MM-HMM.

07:10.230 --> 07:12.566
YOU'RE DATING A LAWYER?

07:12.600 --> 07:14.702
WHO I MET IN CHURCH.

07:14.735 --> 07:17.505
THAT'S SUPPOSED
TO MAKE IT BETTER?

07:17.538 --> 07:19.573
LOOK, DOCTOR, NO ONE WANTS
TO VIOLATE FEDERAL LAW,

07:19.607 --> 07:21.542
BUT IF WE'RE GOING TO FIND OUT
WHO KILLED CHRIS

07:21.575 --> 07:25.178
AND WHERE YOUR
MEDICATIONS WENT --

07:25.212 --> 07:27.615
TO DRAW UP A WARRANT
ASSIGNING A SPECIAL MASTER,

07:27.648 --> 07:28.982
THEN YOU CAN EXAMINE
MEDICAL RECORDS.

07:29.016 --> 07:30.684
PARDON ME.

07:30.718 --> 07:32.252
DAVID, WHY DON'T YOU GO
WITH ANN SOMEWHERE

07:32.285 --> 07:35.122
WHERE SHE COULD
MORE FREELY EXPLAIN

07:35.155 --> 07:36.690
HOW A SPECIAL MASTER MIGHT WORK
IN THIS SITUATION?

07:36.724 --> 07:37.591
YEAH.
THANK YOU.

07:37.625 --> 07:39.627
AND, UH, MAKE SURE

07:39.660 --> 07:41.529
TO WRITE IT ALL DOWN,
WOULD YOU?

07:41.562 --> 07:42.696
YES, MA'AM.

07:42.730 --> 07:45.065
THANK YOU.
THANK YOU SO MUCH.

07:45.098 --> 07:47.968
LOOK, DOCTOR, I DON'T NEED
TO KNOW WHY A PERSON WAS HERE.

07:48.001 --> 07:51.204
I JUST NEED THEIR NAMES.

07:51.238 --> 07:54.274
ON AN AS-NEEDED BASIS.

07:54.307 --> 07:56.577
OF PEOPLE WHO MIGHT HAVE BEEN
UPSET WITH DR. BRADY

07:56.610 --> 07:58.546
AND A CONTACT LIST
OF NEXT OF KIN.

07:58.579 --> 08:00.681
I DON'T HAVE TIME
FOR THIS RIGHT NOW.

08:00.714 --> 08:03.584
I HAVE MEDICATIONS I NEED
TO REPLACE FOR TOMORROW...

08:03.617 --> 08:05.919
DOCTOR, NO ONE IS COMING
HERE TOMORROW.
...EXTRA HELP TO CALL IN
TO GET MY INFUSION ROOM --

08:05.953 --> 08:07.955
TO SET IT UP --
YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE TO SEND
YOUR PATIENTS SOMEWHERE ELSE.

08:07.988 --> 08:09.590
I AM NOT GOING TO EXPOSE MYSELF
TO LIABILITY ISSUES.

08:09.623 --> 08:10.991
SIR, THIS OFFICE
IS A CRIME SCENE,

08:11.024 --> 08:13.827
AND IT WILL REMAIN CLOSED
UNTIL WE PROCESS IT.

08:13.861 --> 08:15.228
IS THERE SOMETHING WRONG
WITH YOUR HEARING,

08:15.262 --> 08:16.830
OR DO YOU JUST NOT CARE
ABOUT PEOPLE WITH CANCER?

08:22.803 --> 08:25.005
OH, YOU DON'T WANT
TO ANSWER THAT,

08:25.038 --> 08:26.273
SO YOU JUST WALK OFF?

08:26.306 --> 08:28.075
HEY.

08:28.108 --> 08:30.143
YOU WANT SOME ANSWERS?
I'LL GIVE YOU SOME ANSWERS.

08:30.177 --> 08:32.980
HER FATHER'S RECOVERING
FROM CANCER RIGHT NOW,

08:33.013 --> 08:34.782
SO DO YOU HAVE
ANY MORE GENIUS QUESTIONS?

08:34.815 --> 08:36.617
Provenza:
JUST DO WHAT WE ASK.

08:36.650 --> 08:38.952
WRITE DOWN
WHO WAS HERE YESTERDAY,

08:38.986 --> 08:41.254
ANYBODY THAT WAS UPSET
WITH DR. BRADY,

08:41.288 --> 08:42.623
AND HIS NEXT OF KIN.

08:44.057 --> 08:47.661
UNTIL I GET MY OFFICE BACK,
YOU GET JACK.

08:56.870 --> 08:58.171
UH, SO, CHIEF, TURNS OUT

08:58.205 --> 09:00.674
OUR VICTIM FIRED ONE
OF HIS NURSES LAST WEEK --

09:00.708 --> 09:02.009
A WOMAN NAMED LORI SHAW.

09:02.042 --> 09:04.111
DO WE KNOW WHY
SHE WAS LET GO?

09:04.144 --> 09:05.846
NO, MA'AM. BUT I TOLD HER
WE NEEDED TO GET A SET

09:05.879 --> 09:07.180
OF ELIMINATION PRINTS
FROM HER.

09:07.214 --> 09:08.816
SHE'S IN INTERVIEW ROOM 2.

09:08.849 --> 09:10.618
DO YOU WANT ME
TO TALK TO HER?

09:10.651 --> 09:12.185
NO. NO. WE'LL BOTH GO.
UH...

09:12.219 --> 09:14.855
WOULD YOU PLEASE LET
LIEUTENANT PROVENZA KNOW

09:14.888 --> 09:16.890
THAT I'M WAITING FOR AN UPDATE
FROM HIM?

09:16.924 --> 09:18.959
YES, MA'AM.
THANK YOU SO MUCH.

09:21.194 --> 09:24.197
SO NOW IT'S NOT
JUST YOUR MOTHER.

09:24.231 --> 09:26.233
YOUR BOSS HATES ME, TOO.

09:26.266 --> 09:28.802
NO, SHE'S JUST...

09:28.836 --> 09:31.071
REALLY FOCUSED ON THE MURDER
RIGHT NOW.

09:31.104 --> 09:32.740
AND MY MOM LOVES YOU.

09:32.773 --> 09:34.241
OH

09:34.274 --> 09:35.375
SHE DOES!

09:35.408 --> 09:36.744
DON'T. DAVID.

09:38.278 --> 09:39.747
LORI SHAW?

09:39.780 --> 09:42.115
I'M DEPUTY CHIEF JOHNSON.

09:42.149 --> 09:43.817
THANK YOU SO MUCH
FOR GIVING UP

09:43.851 --> 09:45.252
SOME OF YOUR SUNDAY
TO TALK TO US.

09:45.285 --> 09:48.055
I CAN ONLY IMAGINE
HOW YOU MUST FEEL

09:48.088 --> 09:49.857
AFTER WORKING FOR DR. BRADY
FOR HOW LONG?

09:49.890 --> 09:52.292
THREE YEARS.

09:52.325 --> 09:54.828
LOOK, CAN I ASK?

09:54.862 --> 09:56.363
WAS HIS MURDER
IN ANY WAY DRUG

09:56.396 --> 09:57.998
AND WHY WOULD YOU
THINK THAT, MA'AM?

09:58.031 --> 09:59.833
ABOUT TWO WEEKS AGO,

09:59.867 --> 10:03.236
I WAS LOOKING THROUGH
SOME CHARTS WHEN I NOTICED

10:03.270 --> 10:06.807
WHAT LOOKED LIKE
SOME CREATIVE ACCOUNTING.

10:06.840 --> 10:08.275
YOU MEAN FRAUD?

10:08.308 --> 10:10.277
I DON'T KNOW.

10:10.310 --> 10:13.313
DR. BRADY WAS ONE OF
THE MOST CARING PHYSICIANS

10:13.346 --> 10:14.948
I'D EVER WORKED FOR.

10:14.982 --> 10:17.718
BUT...HE HADN'T BEEN
HIMSELF LATELY.

10:17.751 --> 10:21.088
FIRST, WE LOST A FEW MORE
PATIENTS THAN WE USUALLY DO.

10:21.121 --> 10:22.756
THAT HAPPENS,

10:22.790 --> 10:25.325
BUT THEN THESE ODD
PRESCRIPTION ORDERS TURNED UP.

10:25.358 --> 10:27.360
AND YOU ASKED DR. BRADY
ABOUT THEM?

10:27.394 --> 10:29.396
OH.

10:29.429 --> 10:31.164
PARDON ME
FOR INTERRUPTING.

10:31.198 --> 10:34.034
DID MAJOR CRIMES
TELL A DR. PARR

10:34.067 --> 10:35.903
THAT HE COULD NOT INFUSE
CANCER PATIENTS

10:35.936 --> 10:37.437
AT HIS OFFICE
TOMORROW MORNING?

10:37.470 --> 10:40.273
YES. WE'RE STILL PROCESSING
THE SCENE.

10:40.307 --> 10:42.943
AND LIEUTENANTS FLYNN AND
PROVENZA WERE LEFT BEHIND TO...

10:42.976 --> 10:44.678
TALK THE DOCTOR
INTO COOPERATING?

10:44.712 --> 10:47.380
WELL, YES. WHY?

10:47.414 --> 10:50.718
BECAUSE CHIEF POPE
IS DRIVING IN RIGHT NOW

10:50.751 --> 10:54.254
TO TALK ABOUT HOW HE WOULD LIKE
MAJOR CRIMES TO...PROCEED.

10:54.287 --> 10:57.758
Lori: AS A NURSE, I COMPLETELY
UNDERSTOOD HIS COMMITMENT

10:57.791 --> 11:01.695
TO THE POOR AND TO THE SICK,
AND I ADMIRED HIM FOR IT.

11:01.729 --> 11:03.296
DR. BRADY HATED THE IDEA
OF PEOPLE DYING

11:03.330 --> 11:04.765
JUST BECAUSE IT WAS
TOO EXPENSIVE

11:04.798 --> 11:06.033
TO CURE THEM.

11:06.066 --> 11:09.770
BUT WHEN I TOLD HIM

11:09.803 --> 11:11.238
A LITTLE TOO FAR,

11:11.271 --> 11:13.040
HE SAID THAT
I COULD EITHER QUIT

11:13.073 --> 11:14.141
OR HE WOULD HAVE TO FIRE ME.

11:14.174 --> 11:15.175
SO I LEFT.

11:15.208 --> 11:17.144
BUZZ: Chief?

11:17.177 --> 11:19.880
SORRY. CAPTAIN RAYDOR
WOULD LIKE A WORD.

11:23.150 --> 11:26.754
I-IF YOU THOUGHT THAT DR. BRADY
WAS BREAKING THE LAW,

11:26.787 --> 11:28.155
WHY DIDN'T YOU CONTACT
THE AUTHORITIES?

11:28.188 --> 11:30.090
YOU KNOW HOW HARD IT IS
FOR A NURSE

11:30.123 --> 11:34.161
TO GET HIRED ANYWHERE ELSE

11:34.194 --> 11:36.463
FOR SCAMMING MEDICARE?

11:36.496 --> 11:38.198
AND HOW DID
DR. BRADY DO THAT?

11:38.231 --> 11:40.467
BY ORDERING LOTS OF
EXPENSIVE PRESCRIPTIONS

11:40.500 --> 11:42.069
HIS PATIENTS DIDN'T NEED.

11:42.102 --> 11:44.371
AND WHAT MADE YOU SO SURE

11:44.404 --> 11:47.240
BECAUSE THE PATIENTS
THAT DR. BRADY

11:47.274 --> 11:49.709
WAS ORDERING THEM FOR
DIDN'T EXIST.

11:57.550 --> 12:01.188
WELL, I JUST TRANSFERRED,
ACTUALLY.

12:01.221 --> 12:02.856
LET'S NOT USE
THE WORD "WRONG."

12:02.890 --> 12:05.125
LET'S SAY THE SITUATION
HAS BECOME COMPLEX.

12:05.158 --> 12:06.459
WHAT SITUATION?

12:06.493 --> 12:08.195
AM I THE ONLY ONE
WHO REMEMBERS

12:08.228 --> 12:09.797
THAT FEDERAL LAWSUIT
WE SETTLED?

12:09.830 --> 12:11.431
ABSENT THE APPOINTMENT
OF A SPECIAL MASTER,

12:11.464 --> 12:13.033
THE HIPAA STATUTE --

12:13.066 --> 12:15.335
EXCUSE ME. I'M NOT ASKING
FOR PATIENT INFORMATION!

12:19.907 --> 12:22.475
SHOULD I APOLOGIZE
FOR BEING RIGHT?

12:22.509 --> 12:25.278
OH, GOD.

12:25.312 --> 12:26.914
Brenda:
DO YOU KNOW HOW LONG IT TAKES

12:26.947 --> 12:28.348
TO GET A WARRANT
WITH A SPECIAL MASTER?

12:28.381 --> 12:30.050
12 TO 16 HOURS.

12:30.083 --> 12:31.985
YEAH, AND IT HAS TO BE DONE
THROUGH THE D.D.A.'s OFFICE.

12:32.019 --> 12:33.486
WHICH IS WHY I CALLED
D.D.A. HOBBS

12:33.520 --> 12:35.422
AND ASKED HER TO RUSH IT
THROUGH TO TOMORROW.

12:35.455 --> 12:37.791
THERE. HAPPY?!
NO. NO, I'M NOT.

12:37.825 --> 12:39.392
THAT ONLY GETS
A SPECIAL MASTER APPOINTED.

12:39.426 --> 12:40.961
IT COULD TAKE DAYS --
WEEKS, EVEN --

12:40.994 --> 12:42.295
TO SORT THROUGH
WHAT WE NEED.

12:42.329 --> 12:43.897
AND IF DR. BRADY
WAS KILLED

12:43.931 --> 12:46.166
BECAUSE HE WAS
PROVIDING MEDICATIONS

12:46.199 --> 12:47.534
FOR "FICTITIOUS" PATIENTS,

12:47.567 --> 12:49.069
WHICH IS WHAT A NURSE
HE JUST FIRED

12:49.102 --> 12:50.070
TOLD US WAS HAPPENING --

12:50.103 --> 12:53.106
THIS NURSE WAS LET GO.

12:53.140 --> 12:54.141
WELL, SOMETHING
YOU WOULD KNOW ABOUT.

12:54.174 --> 12:56.243
WHAT?

12:56.276 --> 12:57.845
Raydor:
UH, PARDON ME.

12:57.878 --> 12:59.813
COMMANDER TAYLOR,
YOU'VE GOT GOOD NEWS.

12:59.847 --> 13:01.481
UH, YEAH. YEAH.
FLYNN AND PROVENZA,

13:01.514 --> 13:03.884
THEY GOT DR. PARR
TO COME DOWNTOWN.

13:03.917 --> 13:05.385
THEY'RE HOPING THAT
MAYBE YOU CAN TALK HIM

13:05.418 --> 13:07.420
INTO BEING MORE HELPFUL.

13:07.454 --> 13:09.089
AND AM I SUPPOSED TO DO
SOMETHING IN RETURN

13:09.122 --> 13:10.557
FOR THE HONOR
OF DR. PARR'S COMPANY?

13:10.590 --> 13:12.926
LOOK, THIS DOCTOR'S OFFICE
IS A LEGAL MINE FIELD.

13:12.960 --> 13:14.427
IF WE INTERFERE
WITH TREATMENT,

13:14.461 --> 13:16.296
ANY ONE OF HIS PATIENTS
COULD SUE US.

13:16.329 --> 13:17.330
I DON'T HAVE TIME TO PROCESS
A CRIME SCENE

13:17.364 --> 13:18.531
BEFORE TOMORROW MORNING.

13:18.565 --> 13:22.269
THEN LOOK
FOR THE MISSING DRUGS!

13:22.302 --> 13:25.338
ESTABLISH A TIMELINE.
LET THE SYSTEM WORK!

13:27.140 --> 13:28.942
TRY TO
HELP HER UNDERSTAND, OKAY?

13:28.976 --> 13:31.578
SERIOUSLY.

13:35.983 --> 13:37.384
WHEN IS DR. PARR ARRIVING?

13:37.417 --> 13:38.952
UH, ANY MINUTE.

13:38.986 --> 13:41.421
LOOK, THOUGH YOU HEARD
THE CHIEF ORDER US

13:41.454 --> 13:44.024
TO GIVE THIS MAN BACK
HIS INFUSION ROOM,

13:44.057 --> 13:47.861
I, UH, I MAY HAVE
NEGLECTED TO MENTION THAT

13:47.895 --> 13:50.397
TO DR. PARR BEFORE
I INVITED HIM DOWNTOWN.

13:50.430 --> 13:52.299
THANK YOU.

13:52.332 --> 13:53.934
THANK YOU, COMMANDER.

13:53.967 --> 13:55.969
GIVES YOU
A FIGHTING CHANCE, RIGHT?

13:57.437 --> 13:59.973
ANYWAY, GOOD LUCK.

14:08.615 --> 14:11.218
CAPTAIN, I THOUGHT YOU WERE
STILL MONITORING MY DIVISION

14:11.251 --> 14:14.454
BECAUSE OF THE LEAK.

14:14.487 --> 14:16.623
CHIEF POPE
DIDN'T TELL YOU?

14:16.656 --> 14:19.492
TELL ME WHAT?

14:19.526 --> 14:21.261
I'M NOW SUPPOSED TO INFORM
THE D.A.'s OFFICE

14:21.294 --> 14:24.331
EVERY TIME MAJOR CRIMES
ROLLS OUT FOR A HOMICIDE.

14:26.033 --> 14:27.234
I THOUGHT YOU KNEW.

14:27.267 --> 14:29.036
I DIDN'T.

14:29.069 --> 14:30.637
YES!

14:30.670 --> 14:33.106
EXCUSE ME, CHIEF.
WALLY SANDERS IS HERE.

14:33.140 --> 14:34.674
WHO IS THAT?

14:34.707 --> 14:36.643
THE WHOLESALE PHARMACEUTICAL
SUPPLIER FOR DR. BRADY.

14:36.676 --> 14:38.445
OH, RIGHT.

14:38.478 --> 14:40.213
YOU FOUND HIS NAME ON THE
VICTIM'S CELLPHONE CALENDAR,

14:40.247 --> 14:41.681
MAYBE THE LAST PERSON
TO SEE HIM ALIVE?

14:41.714 --> 14:43.116
YES, OF COURSE.
THANK YOU. I'LL BE RIGHT THERE.

14:45.718 --> 14:48.688
DOES CHIEF POPE REALLY WANT
A D.D.A. INVOLVED

14:48.721 --> 14:51.691
IN ALL MY CASES
FROM THE VERY BEGINNING

14:51.724 --> 14:53.560
THE CHIEF BELIEVES
HE'S ABOUT TO BE APPOINTED

14:53.593 --> 14:54.694
TO HIS OWN FULL TERM.

14:54.727 --> 14:55.929
HE WILL MOVE UPSTAIRS.

14:55.963 --> 14:58.331
HE WILL BE FURTHER REMOVED

14:58.365 --> 15:00.167
FROM DAY-TO-DAY SUPERVISION
OF DIVISIONS.

15:00.200 --> 15:01.501
YEAH, SO NOW
HE'S SADDLING ME

15:01.534 --> 15:03.570
WITH AS MANY BABYSITTERS
AS POSSIBLE, IS THAT IT?

15:03.603 --> 15:06.706
I'M KEEPING THE D.A.'s OFFICE
BUSY WITH THE SPECIAL MASTER.

15:06.739 --> 15:09.476
D.D.A. HOBBS WON'T EVEN BE ABLE
TO CROSS THE STREET

15:09.509 --> 15:12.212
BEFORE TOMORROW AFTERNOON.
AT THE EARLIEST.

15:12.245 --> 15:14.281
WELL, IT'S NICE TO KNOW
THAT YOU AND COMMANDER TAYLOR

15:14.314 --> 15:15.282
ARE RUNNING INTERFERENCE
FOR ME.

15:19.619 --> 15:21.054
THANK YOU.

15:24.357 --> 15:26.559
THANK YOU.
EXCUSE ME.

15:31.531 --> 15:33.700
I-I DON'T KNOW
IF I CAN BE MUCH HELP.

15:33.733 --> 15:35.435
YOU KNOW, I DON'T DELIVER
THE KIND OF DRUGS

15:35.468 --> 15:40.140
THAT PEOPLE
WANT TO STEAL.

15:40.173 --> 15:43.210
WELL,
THIS IS A COMPLETE LIST

15:43.243 --> 15:46.413
FIVE PRESCRIPTIONS?

15:46.446 --> 15:48.748
BUT IT -- IT VARIES
FROM WEEK TO WEEK.

15:48.781 --> 15:51.284
MAN...

15:51.318 --> 15:53.653
IT'S REALLY AWFUL.

15:53.686 --> 15:55.522
HE WAS ONE
OF THE GOOD GUYS.

15:55.555 --> 15:58.725
I DON'T KNOW WHERE A LOT
OF HIS PATIENTS ARE GONNA GO.

15:58.758 --> 16:00.627
WON'T DR. PARR TAKE THEM?
NO.

16:00.660 --> 16:03.663
WELL, YOU SEE, THEY TREAT
DIFFERENT KINDS OF CANCERS,

16:03.696 --> 16:05.632
AND THEY HAVE DIFFERENT
APPROACHES. CHRIS WOULD --

16:05.665 --> 16:09.336
DR. BRADY, HE --
HE WOULD SEE SICK PEOPLE

16:09.369 --> 16:11.104
REGARDLESS OF WHETHER OR NOT
THEY COULD PAY.

16:11.138 --> 16:13.406
IT'S ONE OF THE REASONS HE GOT
THE MEDICATIONS THROUGH ME.

16:13.440 --> 16:15.475
I MEAN, EVEN WITH MY DISCOUNTS,
CANCER DRUGS ARE NOT CHEAP.

16:15.508 --> 16:18.645
YOU SELL
DISCOUNT CHEMOTHERAPY?

16:18.678 --> 16:21.614
CHIEF, MR. SANDERS' COMPANY
SERVES AS A LINK

16:21.648 --> 16:24.484
BETWEEN LARGE PHARMACIES
AND DOCTORS' OFFICES.

16:24.517 --> 16:27.020
SOME OF THESE MEDICATIONS
HAVE A VERY SHORT SHELF LIFE.

16:27.054 --> 16:29.222
SO RATHER THAN LET THEM GO BAD
WHEN THEY'RE NOT SELLING,

16:29.256 --> 16:31.258
THE COMPANY I WORK FOR
GETS THEM OUT TO THE DOCTORS

16:31.291 --> 16:34.161
AT STEEPLY
REDUCED PRICES.

16:34.194 --> 16:36.196
THE EFFICACY OF THE MEDICATIONS
IS THE SAME.

16:36.229 --> 16:38.131
ACTUALLY,
IT'S THE EXPIRATION DATE

16:38.165 --> 16:40.033
THAT MAKES STEALING
WHAT I DELIVERED
YESTERDAY EVEN CRAZIER.

16:40.067 --> 16:42.369
I MEAN, UNLESS YOU WERE
GONNA DELIVER THOSE DRUGS

16:42.402 --> 16:44.237
TO SEVERAL PATIENTS
BY NEXT FRIDAY --

16:44.271 --> 16:46.206
BUT THEY ARE EXPENSIVE.

16:46.239 --> 16:48.675
HERE'S ONE
FOR $10,000 A DOSE.

16:48.708 --> 16:50.510
THAT'S THE DISCOUNTED PRICE.

16:50.543 --> 16:55.182
WELL

16:55.215 --> 16:56.549
WELL, IT DEPENDS.

16:56.583 --> 16:58.385
DR. BRADY WOULD PASS
ON THE DISCOUNT.

16:58.418 --> 17:02.122
DR. PARR HAS
A VACATION HOME IN NAPA.

17:02.155 --> 17:05.692
LOOK, WHAT THEY BILL
THEIR PATIENTS IS NOT
MY BUSINESS, REALLY.

17:05.725 --> 17:07.627
BUT I DON'T DELIVER
TO DR. PARR ANYMORE,

17:07.660 --> 17:09.028
IF THAT TELLS YOU
ANYTHING.

17:10.463 --> 17:12.365
WELL,
WHAT ABOUT OTHER DOCTORS?

17:12.399 --> 17:14.067
WOULD A THIEF SELL TO --

17:14.101 --> 17:16.403
NO, REPUTABLE PHYSICIANS
WOULD NEVER EVEN CONSIDER

17:16.436 --> 17:18.271
GETTING THESE DRUGS
OUTSIDE THE SYSTEM.

17:18.305 --> 17:20.173
I MEAN, THERE'S PEOPLE'S
LIVES AT STAKE.

17:20.207 --> 17:22.309
PLUS THEY HAVE TO GET APPROVAL
FROM THE INSURANCE COMPANY

17:22.342 --> 17:24.844
AND MEDICARE BEFORE THE DRUGS
ARE EVEN DELIVERED.

17:24.877 --> 17:26.746
AND THEY HAVE PAPERWORK
FOR THE BILLING.

17:26.779 --> 17:29.649
UH...

17:32.252 --> 17:34.821
OH, I'M SO SORRY,
UH, MR. SANDERS.

17:34.854 --> 17:36.523
THANK YOU SO MUCH.

17:39.726 --> 17:42.162
MAMA?
I NEED TO CALL YOU BACK.

17:42.195 --> 17:44.264
I'M RIGHT IN THE MIDDLE
OF SOMETHING.

17:44.297 --> 17:46.133
I

17:46.166 --> 17:48.668
UM, ALL RIGHT, THEN.
I'LL CALL YOU TOMORROW.

17:48.701 --> 17:50.337
ALL RIGHT.
YOU MAY NOT BE AWARE OF THIS,

17:50.370 --> 17:51.438
BUT I'M VERY GOOD FRIENDS
WITH THE CITY ATTORNEY.

17:51.471 --> 17:55.675
I SAVED HIS MOTHER'S LIFE.

17:55.708 --> 17:58.278
SO I DON'T HAVE TO DO
ANYTHING HE SAYS.

17:58.311 --> 18:00.613
TO INFUSE MY PATIENTS TOMORROW,
I WILL GIVE HIM A CALL --

18:00.647 --> 18:02.215
LET'S NOT THREATEN
EACH OTHER, DOCTOR.

18:02.249 --> 18:04.851
WHY DON'T WE MAKE A DEAL?

18:04.884 --> 18:09.789
WHO ENTERED
YOUR OFFICE YESTERDAY,

18:09.822 --> 18:11.824
I'VE ALREADY TOLD
YOU -- MEDICAL RECORDS
ARE PROTECTED BY --

18:11.858 --> 18:14.294
I'M NOT ASKING YOU TO IDENTIFY
ANY INDIVIDUAL AS A PATIENT.

18:14.327 --> 18:16.129
I'M ASKING FOR A LIST.

18:16.163 --> 18:18.198
NAMES, ADDRESSES,
PHONE NUMBERS, PLEASE.

18:18.231 --> 18:19.832
I'M NOT SURE
I CAN DO THAT LEGALLY.

18:19.866 --> 18:21.668
WELL, WHY DON'T WE
ASK THE EXPERT?

18:21.701 --> 18:24.504
YOU REMEMBER ANN...
GABRIEL.

18:24.537 --> 18:25.772
ANN ORIGINALLY BROUGHT UP
THE HIPAA STATUTE.

18:25.805 --> 18:27.574
THAT'S BECAUSE
SHE IS A LAWYER

18:27.607 --> 18:30.177
WHO ADVISES THE L.A.P.D.
ON MEDICAL ISSUES.

18:30.210 --> 18:32.712
ANN, IF DR. PARR
DOESN'T IDENTIFY ANY
INDIVIDUAL AS A PATIENT,

18:32.745 --> 18:34.547
IS IT LEGAL FOR HIM TO --
WAIT!

18:34.581 --> 18:36.849
YOU'RE HOLDING MY INFUSION ROOM
AS HOSTAGE

18:36.883 --> 18:39.719
TO YOUR INVESTIGA--
I'M NOT HOLDING ANYTHING
HOSTAGE, SIR!

18:39.752 --> 18:41.821
YOU ARE.
I'M OFFERING YOU A CHOICE.

18:41.854 --> 18:43.523
IF YOU THINK
IT'S TOUGH NOW,

18:43.556 --> 18:45.658
WAIT UNTIL WE HAVE A
COURT-APPOINTED SPECIAL MASTER.

18:45.692 --> 18:48.495
YEAH, AND WE HAVE SOMEBODY

18:48.528 --> 18:49.896
WILL WE DISCOVER
THAT YOU WERE BUYING

18:49.929 --> 18:51.398
SOME OF YOUR DRUGS
AT DISCOUNT

18:51.431 --> 18:53.300
WHILE CHARGING YOUR PATIENTS
FULL PRICE?

18:53.333 --> 18:55.435
THERE'S NOTHING ILLEGAL
ABOUT THAT.

18:55.468 --> 18:58.638
OR THAT DR. BRADY WAS SUBMITTING
PAPERWORK TO MEDICARE

18:58.671 --> 19:00.307
FOR IMAGINARY PATIENTS?

19:00.340 --> 19:01.641
DOES HIPAA COVER THEM, TOO?

19:01.674 --> 19:04.377
IT'S NOT TRUE.
HE WASN'T --

19:04.411 --> 19:07.580
NO, NO, NO.
IT WASN'T LIKE THAT.

19:07.614 --> 19:09.749
MAYBE WE SHOULD HAVE THE FBI
CONFIRM THAT.

19:09.782 --> 19:11.351
OF COURSE,
THERE'S A CHANCE

19:11.384 --> 19:13.220
THE MEDIA COULD GET
THE STORY FIRST.

19:13.253 --> 19:15.522
GEE, I WONDER WHAT THAT WOULD
MEAN TO YOUR BUSINESS.

19:15.555 --> 19:18.358
Brenda:
OR YOU COULD GIVE US THE NAMES,

19:18.391 --> 19:19.692
TO EXAMINE
THEIR MEDICAL RECORDS.

19:21.261 --> 19:23.930
AND BY COOPERATING HERE,
I INCUR NO LIABILITY?

19:23.963 --> 19:25.698
OH, I...

19:28.335 --> 19:30.937
DON'T...
SEE WHY YOU WOULD.

19:30.970 --> 19:35.242
LOOK, I THINK THAT YOU COULD
HAVE EVEN MORE PROBLEMS

19:35.275 --> 19:36.709
IF YOUR PATIENTS DON'T RECEIVE
THEIR TREATMENTS, DOCTOR.

19:38.945 --> 19:40.713
FINE.

19:41.814 --> 19:43.316
I'LL GIVE YOU THE NAMES.

19:43.350 --> 19:45.952
JUST TRY
AND BE DISCREET.

19:45.985 --> 19:48.521
OH, DOCTOR.
DISCRETION'S MY SPECIALTY.

20:03.736 --> 20:07.874
OH, MY GOD.

20:07.907 --> 20:10.243
BUT WATCHING YOUR BOSS
IN PERSON IS JUST...

20:10.277 --> 20:14.481
SHE'S INTENSE.

20:14.514 --> 20:15.982
I MEAN, DON'T FORGET
THE DEAD DOCTOR.

20:16.015 --> 20:17.817
WHOEVER KILLED HIM
IS PRETTY INTENSE, TOO.

20:17.850 --> 20:20.587
AND IF IT'S A DRUG USER,

20:20.620 --> 20:22.722
YOU KNOW,
ON A BRIGHTER NOTE,

20:22.755 --> 20:25.958
YOU WE HERE LONG ENOUGH TO
AVOID MEETING MY GRANDPARENTS.

20:25.992 --> 20:28.395
OH, WELL,
THEY'RE HERE TILL FRIDAY,

20:28.428 --> 20:31.498
SO I THINK WE'LL HAVE PLENTY
OF TIME TO TELL EVERYONE

20:31.531 --> 20:33.266
ABOUT OUR NEW
LIVING ARRANGEMENTS.

20:35.668 --> 20:36.703
OH.

20:36.736 --> 20:39.038
OH. OH.

20:39.071 --> 20:41.374
UH, ANN.

20:41.408 --> 20:42.642
UH...
HI.

20:43.876 --> 20:45.978
OH.
ARE YOU LEAVING SO SOON?

20:46.012 --> 20:49.048
WELL, ASK CHIEF JOHNSON
HOW SOON IT FEELS.

20:49.081 --> 20:51.651
LEAVING TOO LATE, MAYBE.

20:53.620 --> 20:55.288
UH, SHOULD I COME BACK
TO GET YOU?

20:55.322 --> 20:56.656
UH, NO, NO.
WITH ALL THE MEDICAL RECORDS

20:56.689 --> 20:58.325
WE'RE GONNA BE GETTING,
IT'S GONNA TAKE SOME TIME.

20:58.358 --> 20:59.592
I'LL, UH, I'LL JUST SEE YOU
WHEN I GET HOME.

20:59.626 --> 21:00.927
OKAY.

21:00.960 --> 21:01.961
ALL RIGHT.
BYE.

21:01.994 --> 21:03.730
UH, GOOD NIGHT.

21:03.763 --> 21:06.466
UH...BYE.

21:06.499 --> 21:07.767
BYE.

21:11.438 --> 21:14.006
YOU LIVE TOGETHER.

21:14.040 --> 21:17.744
UH, WELL, YEAH.

21:17.777 --> 21:20.580
BUT, UH, WE'VE BEEN DATING
FOR ABOUT A YEAR NOW.

21:20.613 --> 21:22.315
YOU KNOW,
FELT LIKE IT WAS TIME.

21:22.349 --> 21:24.784
YOU KNOW, I HAVEN'T TOLD
MY FAMILY YET.

21:24.817 --> 21:27.887
I'D ACTUALLY APPRECIATE IT

21:27.920 --> 21:31.023
KNOWING WHAT PEOPLE THINK
ABOUT LAWYERS.

21:31.057 --> 21:32.492
MARRIED ONE MYSELF.

21:32.525 --> 21:34.327
REALLY?

21:34.361 --> 21:35.895
WELL, TECHNICALLY,
HE WAS A LAWYER.

21:35.928 --> 21:39.532
FIRST, HE PASSED THE BAR,

21:39.566 --> 21:41.033
TILL HE GAVE THAT UP
FOR GAMBLING.

21:41.067 --> 21:42.635
SO, WHAT,
YOU'RE DIVORCED?

21:42.669 --> 21:44.103
SEPARATED.
FOR 20 YEARS.

21:44.136 --> 21:45.538
IT'S ALL VERY CATHOLIC.

21:45.572 --> 21:49.676
UM, DETECTIVE, UH,
FOR WHAT IT'S WORTH,

21:49.709 --> 21:52.111
I FIND FROM TIME TO TIME
A LAWYER'S OPINION

21:52.144 --> 21:54.547
ON WHAT I'M DOING
IS WORTH HEARING.

21:54.581 --> 21:56.683
OH, YEAH, I GET ANN'S
POINT OF VIEW ON EVERYTHING,

21:56.716 --> 21:58.050
WHETHER I WANT IT OR NOT,
FRANKLY.

21:58.084 --> 22:00.420
IT'S MORE THE OPINIONS
OF THE PEOPLE AROUND HERE

22:00.453 --> 22:02.422
THAT I'M NOT INTERESTED
IN DEALING WITH RIGHT NOW.

22:02.455 --> 22:04.090
SECRET'S SAFE WITH ME.

22:04.123 --> 22:05.625
THANK YOU, CAPTAIN.
MM-HMM.

22:05.658 --> 22:07.627
UH, DETECTIVE?

22:07.660 --> 22:08.961
YEAH.

22:08.995 --> 22:10.930
THIS IS D.D.A. HOBBS'
APPLICATION

22:10.963 --> 22:12.131
FOR A SPECIAL MASTER.

22:12.164 --> 22:15.602
IT NEEDS A SIGNATURE

22:15.635 --> 22:17.770
WOULD YOU MIND WALKING
CHIEF JOHNSON THROUGH IT FOR ME?

22:17.804 --> 22:20.940
I THINK SHE'S, UH, SEEN ENOUGH
OF ME TODAY.

22:20.973 --> 22:23.510
YEAH. NO PROBLEM.

22:23.543 --> 22:24.844
GOOD. THANK YOU.

22:24.877 --> 22:26.379
YOU'RE WELCOME, CAPTAIN.

22:27.914 --> 22:29.949
JUST TELL ME WHAT
YOU'RE SEARCHING FOR.

22:29.982 --> 22:32.585
MAYBE WE WOULDN'T HAVE TO
FAX OVER EVERY SINGLE PAGE

22:32.619 --> 22:34.153
OF EVERY PATIENT'S
RECORDS.

22:34.186 --> 22:36.155
I AM LOOKING FOR
THE MURDERER, DOCTOR.

22:36.188 --> 22:37.156
I'M SO SORRY.

22:37.189 --> 22:38.691
I KNOW THAT THIS HAS BEEN

22:38.725 --> 22:43.530
AN ENORMOUS
IMPOSITION ON YOUR TIME,

22:43.563 --> 22:44.831
WHAT MAKES YOU SO SURE
CHRIS' KILLER

22:44.864 --> 22:46.065
WAS SOMEONE FROM
SATURDAY'S APPOINTMENTS?

22:46.098 --> 22:47.900
MAYBE HE WAS MURDERED
BY SOMEONE

22:47.934 --> 22:49.869
JUST WALKING IN
OFF THE STREET.

22:49.902 --> 22:52.605
'CAUSE AFTER SMASHING DR. BRADY
ON THE HEAD,

22:52.639 --> 22:54.441
SOMEONE OFF THE STREETS WOULD
HAVE GRABBED THE DRUGS AND RUN.

22:54.474 --> 22:56.809
INSTEAD, YOUR PARTNER
WAS STRANGLED TO DEATH.

22:56.843 --> 23:00.947
WITH I.V. TUBING.

23:00.980 --> 23:02.549
OUR MURDERER IMPROVISED

23:02.582 --> 23:04.183
WITH STUFF HE FOUND
AROUND THE OFFICE,

23:04.216 --> 23:06.118
STUFF THAT HE MIGHT HAVE KNOWN
WAS THERE.

23:06.152 --> 23:08.020
WHICH INDICATES
THAT DR. BRADY KNEW

23:08.054 --> 23:10.490
AND RECOGNIZED HIS KILLER
AND THAT THE KILLER KNEW HIM,

23:10.523 --> 23:12.124
WHICH IS WHY
THE LESS HELPFUL YOU ARE,

23:12.158 --> 23:17.864
THE MORE WORRIED
YOU MAKE ME.

23:17.897 --> 23:19.799
AND HERE I AM GOING TO HIS.

23:19.832 --> 23:22.001
CAN NEVER BE
TOO SURE OF ANYTHING

23:22.034 --> 23:23.536
IN THIS LIFETIME, CAN YOU?

23:23.570 --> 23:25.738
AND YOU HAVE NO IDEA
WHO HIS KILLER IS?

23:25.772 --> 23:26.873
NO, MA'AM. NOT YET.

23:26.906 --> 23:29.175
Tao: IF YOU COULD SIGN
THIS WAIVER,

23:29.208 --> 23:31.878
WE'LL HAVE DR. PARR HERE
FAX US YOUR MEDICAL RECORDS.

23:31.911 --> 23:34.981
UM, IT COULD HELP US.

23:35.014 --> 23:36.783
OH.

23:36.816 --> 23:40.753
YOU JUST HAD YOUR CHEMOTHERAPY
YESTERDAY, MISS...?

23:40.787 --> 23:43.122
UM, L-LEE.
RITA LEE. YES.

23:43.155 --> 23:46.192
I FEEL PRETTY GOOD,
ALL THINGS CONSIDERED.

23:46.225 --> 23:48.761
DR. BRADY WAS
AN AMAZING ONCOLOGIST.

23:48.795 --> 23:53.466
HE REALLY CARED
ABOUT PEOPLE.

23:53.500 --> 23:55.134
AND THE RASH
WILL COME BACK,

23:55.167 --> 23:57.036
AND MY HAIR
WILL FALL OUT AGAIN --

23:57.069 --> 23:59.539
THE SIDE EFFECTS I GET
WHEN THOSE PEOPLE TREAT ME.

23:59.572 --> 24:01.674
THE PRESENCE OR ABSENCE
OF SIDE EFFECTS

24:01.708 --> 24:02.842
HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH
THE STANDARDIZED DELIVERY

24:02.875 --> 24:04.210
OF CHEMOTHERAPY AGENTS.

24:04.243 --> 24:06.813
INDIVIDUAL RESULTS VARY
BASED ON THE --

24:06.846 --> 24:10.950
YOU WOULD SAY THAT,
WOULDN'T YOU?

24:10.983 --> 24:13.152
I'VE SEEN THEM, WHAT YOU PUT
THOSE PEOPLE THROUGH!

24:16.956 --> 24:17.990
OKAY, I'M SORRY.

24:18.024 --> 24:19.191
UM, I'LL SIGN.

24:19.225 --> 24:20.927
YOU CAN GET
MY MEDICAL RECORDS.

24:20.960 --> 24:22.228
I HOPE IT HELPS YOU
FIND OUT

24:22.261 --> 24:23.930
WHY SOMEONE WOULD MURDER
A DOCTOR

24:23.963 --> 24:25.164
WHO HELPED CANCER PATIENTS

24:25.197 --> 24:27.066
STOP FROM FEELING SICK
ALL THE TIME.

24:29.936 --> 24:31.838
WHAT'S THE MATTER, DOCTOR?

24:31.871 --> 24:33.272
UNLESS HE ASKED ME
SOMETHING SPECIFIC,

24:33.305 --> 24:35.141
I NEVER BOTHERED
WITH CHRIS' PATIENTS.

24:35.174 --> 24:38.144
SINCE YOU HAVE
THEIR RECORDS,

24:38.177 --> 24:39.779
WE HAVE OUR OWN EXPERTS
LOOKING AT THEM.

24:39.812 --> 24:41.080
WHAT DO YOU WANT TO SEE?

24:41.113 --> 24:44.717
REGARDLESS OF
WHAT YOU THINK OF ME,

24:44.751 --> 24:45.985
I'M PROBABLY ONE OF THE MOST
HIGHLY REGARDED PHYSICIANS

24:46.018 --> 24:46.986
IN THE COUNTRY.

24:47.019 --> 24:48.921
REALLY?

24:48.955 --> 24:50.690
YES, REALLY.
CHECK IT OUT.

24:50.723 --> 24:53.593
THAT WOMAN WAS INFUSED
YESTERDAY.

24:53.626 --> 24:54.761
LOOK AT HER.

24:54.794 --> 24:56.062
SHE SEEMS...FINE.

24:56.095 --> 25:00.232
AND I'D LIKE TO KNOW WHY.

25:00.266 --> 25:04.003
THAT'S BECAUSE SHE WASN'T TAKING
CHEMOTHERAPY -- AT ALL.

25:04.036 --> 25:05.304
RITA SAID SHE WAS.

25:05.337 --> 25:07.206
AND THE NURSE'S
RECORDS INDICATE

25:07.239 --> 25:08.875
THAT SHE HAD
A REGULAR DOSE YESTERDAY.

25:08.908 --> 25:10.943
UH, I CAN GO INTO A LOT
OF TECHNICAL DETAIL,

25:10.977 --> 25:11.878
BUT LET'S JUST
KEEP IT SIMPLE.

25:11.911 --> 25:13.279
SEE THAT NUMBER?

25:13.312 --> 25:16.849
THAT'S MS. LEE'S
CARCINOEMBRYONIC ANTIGEN LEVEL.

25:16.883 --> 25:18.685
THAT'S YOUR IDEA
OF KEEPING IT SIMPLE?

25:18.718 --> 25:20.687
SORRY. YOU DON'T HAVE
TO LEARN THE TERMS.

25:20.720 --> 25:22.655
ALL YOU NEED TO KNOW
IS A COUPLE OF NUMBERS.

25:22.689 --> 25:24.824
FIRST, MS. LEE'S CURRENT
CARCINOEMBRYONIC ANTIGEN LEVEL

25:24.857 --> 25:26.893
IS AT 106,

25:26.926 --> 25:28.561
AND ON THE DRUG SHE'S
BEEN TAKING FOR THE
PAST THREE MONTHS,

25:28.595 --> 25:29.762
THAT NUMBER SHOULD BE
LESS THAN THREE.

25:29.796 --> 25:34.734
SO, W

25:34.767 --> 25:37.036
AND SHE'S NOT BEING
TREATED FOR IT.

25:37.069 --> 25:40.740
WHY WOULD DR. BRADY JUST PRETEND
HE WAS GIVING HER THE DRUG?

25:40.773 --> 25:42.141
OH, WELL, WE COULD ASK HIM,

25:42.174 --> 25:46.012
BUT, OH, HEY, WAIT,
HE'S BACK AT THE MORGUE.

25:46.045 --> 25:49.281
OH, MY GOD.
OH, MY GOD.

25:49.315 --> 25:51.784
ACROSS THE BOARD.
ALL THESE PEOPLE.

25:51.818 --> 25:53.152
WHAT?

25:53.185 --> 25:56.255
DR. BRADY'S BEEN
WITHHOLDING CHEMOTHERAPY

25:56.288 --> 25:58.124
FROM EVERY ONE
OF HIS PATIENTS.

26:02.194 --> 26:05.064
Provenza: HMM.
SAY YOU FOUND OUT THAT DR. BRADY

26:05.097 --> 26:06.999
HADN'T BEEN GIVING YOU THE DRUG

26:07.033 --> 26:09.101
THAT'S SUPPOSED
TO SAVE YOUR LIFE.

26:09.135 --> 26:11.003
THAT'S A GOOD MOTIVE
FOR MURDER.

26:11.037 --> 26:12.739
THE NURSE SAID HE'D LOST MORE
PATIENTS THAN USUAL RECENTLY.

26:12.772 --> 26:14.641
Dr. Morales:
I'M NOT SURPRISED.

26:14.674 --> 26:16.743
M-MAYBE YOU SHOULD EXHUME
THE BODIES

26:16.776 --> 26:18.978
WHOA. WHOA.
EXHUMING BODIES?

26:19.011 --> 26:21.648
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?
IT'S SUNDAY NIGHT!

26:21.681 --> 26:24.717
I MIGHT ASK YOU
THE SAME THING.

26:24.751 --> 26:28.287
I CAN'T JUSTIFY
THIS OVERTIME.

26:28.320 --> 26:30.623
MIGHT BE WORTH STAYING LATE
JUST TO STRIKE MEDICARE FRAUD

26:30.657 --> 26:32.158
OFF YOUR LIST
OF POSSIBLE OFFENSES.

26:32.191 --> 26:34.360
WHY?
Fritz:
'CAUSE THERE ISN'T ANY.

26:34.393 --> 26:36.295
DR. BRADY MAY HAVE BEEN BUYING
DRUGS FOR NONEXISTENT PATIENTS,

26:36.328 --> 26:38.030
BUT HE WAS PAYING FOR THEM
OUT OF HIS OWN POCKET.

26:38.064 --> 26:39.999
WHAT?

26:40.032 --> 26:41.634
SO, DR. BRADY ORDERED FALSE
PRESCRIPTIONS FROM MEDICARE,

26:41.668 --> 26:43.235
FILLED THOSE PRESCRIPTIONS

26:43.269 --> 26:45.137
WITH DRUGS
NEAR THEIR EXPIRATION DATE,

26:45.171 --> 26:47.740
PAID FOR THEM
OUT OF HIS OWN POCKET,

26:47.774 --> 26:50.843
AND THEN DELIBERATELY WITHHELD
THEM FROM HIS PATIENTS?

26:50.877 --> 26:52.679
HMM.

26:52.712 --> 26:55.748
THAT'S AN INTERESTING
QUESTION...

26:55.782 --> 26:58.117
WHICH I THINK
COULD BE ANSWERED TOMORROW.

27:01.387 --> 27:06.025
I KNOW, MAMA.
DON'T YOU WORRY.

27:06.058 --> 27:07.894
NO, NO, NO.
THE TICKETS ARE ALL PAID FOR.

27:07.927 --> 27:10.162
YOU JUST SHOW UP AT THE AIRPORT
WITH YOUR I.D.

27:10.196 --> 27:13.099
IF -- IF YOU CAN GET HIM HERE,
I HAVE A PLAN.

27:13.132 --> 27:15.334
YES. I KNOW.

27:15.367 --> 27:17.003
I HEAR HIM CALLING.

27:18.270 --> 27:21.941
WELL, TELL HIM I LOVE HIM,

27:21.974 --> 27:24.010
AND HE NEEDS TO GO WITH ME
ON THIS, OKAY?

27:24.043 --> 27:25.311
YEAH.

27:25.344 --> 27:27.279
ALL RIGHT.

27:28.447 --> 27:29.415
I LOVE YOU, TOO.

27:29.448 --> 27:31.283
OKAY. I --

27:31.317 --> 27:33.686
OKAY.

27:33.720 --> 27:35.722
I'LL SEE Y'ALL
REAL SOON.

27:35.755 --> 27:37.389
BYE NOW.

27:37.423 --> 27:39.926
YOU REALLY THINK YOUR DAD'S
IN GOOD ENOUGH SHAPE

27:39.959 --> 27:42.394
TO COME ALL THE WAY HERE
FROM ATLANTA TOMORROW?

27:42.428 --> 27:44.864
THE DOCTOR'S NOT GONNA FLY OUT
THERE TO SEE HIM,

27:44.897 --> 27:46.432
I CAN TELL YOU THAT.
YOU DIDN'T GET MUCH SLEEP
LAST NIGHT.

27:46.465 --> 27:48.367
HOW COULD YOU TELL?

27:49.869 --> 27:51.871
'CAUSE YOU KEPT ME AWAKE.

27:51.904 --> 27:53.239
I'M SORRY.

27:53.272 --> 27:55.341
IT'S JUST FINDING
ALL THESE PEOPLE WITH CANCER

27:55.374 --> 27:56.375
WHO THOUGHT THEY WERE
GETTING BETTER

27:56.408 --> 27:58.077
WEREN'T EVEN
BEING TREATED.

27:58.110 --> 28:01.347
HONEY, THAT -- THAT COULD
HAPPEN TO DADDY, TOO.

28:01.380 --> 28:03.282
HE'S NOT FEELING
ANY BETTER.

28:03.315 --> 28:07.286
HE'S CANCER-FREE.

28:09.521 --> 28:11.223
AND THERE'S
THIS OTHER THING.

28:11.257 --> 28:12.792
WHAT OTHER THING?

28:12.825 --> 28:15.928
YOU WERE RIGHT
ABOUT POPE ALL ALONG.

28:15.962 --> 28:17.864
OH?

28:17.897 --> 28:19.165
HE'S NOT TRUSTWORTHY.

28:19.198 --> 28:21.033
IN FACT, HE'S A JERK!

28:21.067 --> 28:23.502
HE'S ALWAYS BEEN A JERK.

28:23.535 --> 28:26.839
NOW HE'S ABOUT TO BE MADE
CHIEF FOR LIFE

28:26.873 --> 28:29.041
OR SOMETHING AND -- AND --
AND HE'S GOT THE D.A.

28:29.075 --> 28:30.843
WATCHING OVER ME
AND -- AND -- AND RAYDOR

28:30.877 --> 28:38.851
AND I DON'T KNOW
WHO ELSE.

28:38.885 --> 28:41.353
I MAY NOT HAVE DONE RIGHT
BY EVERYONE IN MY LIFE,

28:41.387 --> 28:44.023
BUT I HAVE ALWAYS GIVEN
MY PROFESSIONAL BEST TO WILL.

28:44.056 --> 28:48.260
AND I'VE ALWAYS, ALWAYS DONE
EVERYTHING HE TOLD ME TO DO.

28:48.294 --> 28:49.962
YOU HAVE?

28:49.996 --> 28:51.898
NO, YOU HAVE.
YOU HAVE.

28:51.931 --> 28:53.900
JUST ASSUMING THAT HE HAD
MY BACK, BUT HE DOESN'T.

28:53.933 --> 28:56.368
HE DOESN' HAVE MY BACK.

28:56.402 --> 28:57.536
I'M...

28:57.569 --> 28:59.138
I'M REALLY UPSET.

28:59.171 --> 29:01.774
WELL, I CAN SEE THAT.

29:01.808 --> 29:03.442
YOU CAN'T.
HE HAS NO DEFENSE.

29:03.475 --> 29:04.844
WILL POPE
IS A SELFISH BASTARD.

29:04.877 --> 29:08.114
YES, HE IS!

29:08.147 --> 29:10.349
WELL...YES.

29:10.382 --> 29:12.484
THAT'S EXACTLY RIGHT.

29:12.518 --> 29:14.520
AND I FEEL YOUR PAIN. I DO.
I REALLY DO.

29:14.553 --> 29:17.023
IT'S HURTFUL, ISN'T IT, WHEN
SOMEONE THINKS THEIR JOB --

29:17.056 --> 29:19.959
I MEAN, THEIR JOB --
IS MORE IMPORTANT

29:19.992 --> 29:23.262
THAN WHAT ANOTHER PERSON
MIGHT WANT OR NEED?

29:23.295 --> 29:26.365
IS THERE ANYONE ELSE
WE KNOW

29:26.398 --> 29:30.870
WHO YOU THINK MIGHT
SOMETIMES BEHAVE LIKE THAT?

29:30.903 --> 29:32.905
HMM?

29:32.939 --> 29:34.506
ANYONE?

29:36.375 --> 29:37.509
OH, MY GOSH.

29:39.011 --> 29:40.579
DOCTORS!

29:40.612 --> 29:43.482
THEY'RE ALL LIKE THAT,
AREN'T THEY?

29:43.515 --> 29:46.285
WELL, DOCTORS, YEAH.
BUT, UM --

29:46.318 --> 29:48.454
MAYBE DR. PARR'S MORE LIKE
HIS PARTNER THAN WE KNOW.

29:54.560 --> 29:56.028
I SAID I WANTED TO EXAMINE
CHRIS' FILES LAST NIGHT,

29:56.062 --> 29:58.130
AND YOU WOULDN'T LET ME.

29:58.164 --> 30:00.132
TODAY, I NEED TO BE
WORKING WITH THE PEOPLE
IN MY OWN PRACTICE.

30:00.166 --> 30:01.533
YOU'RE LUCKY I HAVEN'T SHUT
YOUR PRACTICE DOWN.

30:04.370 --> 30:07.206
I HAVE A SPECIAL MASTER WARRANT
READY TO GO,

30:07.239 --> 30:09.241
AND AS SOON AS I HAVE ACCESS
TO YOUR PATIENTS' CHARTS --

30:09.275 --> 30:11.043
MY PATIENTS?

30:11.077 --> 30:13.212
WHY WOULD YOU WANT TO BE
LOOKING AT MY PATIENTS?

30:13.245 --> 30:14.981
TO FIND OUT IF THEY'VE BEEN
DYING LIKE DR. BRADY'S WERE.

30:16.615 --> 30:18.284
IS THAT WHAT'S
BEEN HAPPENING, SIR?

30:46.012 --> 30:48.047
IT'S VERY STRAIGHTFORWARD,
REALLY.

30:48.080 --> 30:51.083
YOU DRAW THE MEDICATION
FROM A VIAL WITH A SYRINGE,

30:51.117 --> 30:53.085
INJECT IT
INTO A BAG OF SALINE,

30:53.119 --> 30:56.122
AND ADMINISTER THE DRUG
THROUGH AN I.V. DRIP.

30:56.155 --> 30:59.325
THE SYSTEM SHOULD WORK
AS DESIGNED, BUT...

30:59.358 --> 31:02.361
BUT SOMETIMES
WE HAVE MISTAKES.

31:04.463 --> 31:06.165
AWFUL MISTAKES.

31:06.198 --> 31:11.270
SO, LAST NIGHT,

31:11.303 --> 31:12.538
TO THE CHEMO,

31:12.571 --> 31:14.273
I WENT BACK TO MY OFFICE

31:14.306 --> 31:16.342
AND LOOKED AT MY OWN FILES
FROM LAST YEAR.

31:16.375 --> 31:19.011
WHAT DID YOU FIND?

31:19.045 --> 31:21.013
WHAT I THOUGHT I'D FIND.

31:22.681 --> 31:25.384
A PERIOD DURING WHICH
MANY PATIENTS

31:25.417 --> 31:28.387
SEEMED NOT TO PROPERLY ABSORB
THE CHEMO,

31:28.420 --> 31:32.024
WHEN INSTEAD OF IMPROVING,
PEOPLE DIED.

31:32.058 --> 31:34.994
I FELT ERRORS
MAY HAVE BEEN MADE,

31:35.027 --> 31:36.562
BUT I WAS AFRAID

31:36.595 --> 31:39.331
THAT IF I BROUGHT ATTENTION
TO THE PROBLEM, THAT --

31:39.365 --> 31:40.532
YOU'D BE SUED.

31:43.669 --> 31:44.971
YES, I'D BE SUED.

31:46.305 --> 31:49.008
I DEAL WITH LIFE AND DEATH
ON A DAILY BASIS.

31:49.041 --> 31:51.143
I CAN BE TAKEN TO COURT
WHERE EVEN IF I WIN, I LOSE.

31:51.177 --> 31:55.047
MY LIABILITY INSURANCE
GOES UP.

31:55.081 --> 31:56.448
MY PEERS.

31:56.482 --> 31:58.384
AND IF I EVER FIND MYSELF
IN CIRCUMSTANCES

31:58.417 --> 32:00.152
WHERE I CAN'T PROPERLY
CLEAR MY NAME,

32:00.186 --> 32:01.620
NOTHING IS THE SAME
AFTER THAT.

32:04.456 --> 32:06.258
I'M SURE CHRIS WAS THINKING
THE SAME THING, TOO.

32:06.292 --> 32:08.060
IN FACT,
WHEN HIS NURSE TOLD ME

32:08.094 --> 32:10.029
THAT HE HAD ORDERED MEDICATIONS
FOR PATIENTS

32:10.062 --> 32:13.265
THAT DIDN'T REALLY EXIST,

32:13.299 --> 32:20.272
TO SEE IF THEY WERE REAL.

32:20.306 --> 32:22.508
THE DRUGS HE GOT
FROM WALLY SANDERS.

32:24.343 --> 32:25.711
I SUSPECTED
THEY WERE FAKE.

32:27.779 --> 32:31.183
HOW COULD HE GET AWAY
WITH THAT?

32:31.217 --> 32:33.485
WALLY CONTROLS
ALL THE PAPERWORK.

32:33.519 --> 32:36.155
HE HAS ACCESS
TO THE ORIGINAL PACKAGING,

32:36.188 --> 32:39.391
SO COUNTERFEITING IT
WOULD BE SIMPLE ENOUGH.

32:39.425 --> 32:41.327
AS FOR THE REST,
WE JUST...TRUSTED THE WORDS.

32:41.360 --> 32:43.029
WHAT WORDS?

32:43.062 --> 32:45.364
"USE AS DIRECTED."

32:45.397 --> 32:49.001
IF WE CAN'T EVEN BELIEVE
IN THAT, I...

32:49.035 --> 32:51.003
AT $10,000 A DOSE...

32:51.037 --> 32:52.304
WALLY COULD BE
MAKING MILLIONS.

32:52.338 --> 32:53.705
MILLIONS?

32:53.739 --> 32:56.375
HOW MANY ONCOLOGISTS
DOES HE SERVE?

32:56.408 --> 32:58.710
HE DELIVERS DRUGS
TO SAN DIEGO,

32:58.744 --> 33:00.646
ORANGE COUNTY,

33:00.679 --> 33:04.183
PALM SPRINGS, LOS ANGELES,
SANTA BARBARA -- MY GOD.

33:04.216 --> 33:06.252
I SHOULD HAVE REPORTED HIM

33:06.285 --> 33:08.654
INSTEAD OF JUST DROPPING HIM
AS A SUPPLIER.

33:08.687 --> 33:10.056
BUT IF I HAD BEEN WRONG...

33:10.089 --> 33:12.191
DETECTIVE,
WE NEED A WARRANT.

33:12.224 --> 33:15.694
YEAH. SANDERS' HOME,
BUSINESS OFFICE, EVERYTHING.

33:15.727 --> 33:17.096
I'M ON IT, CHIEF.

33:36.148 --> 33:38.617
DR. ROYCE,
I DON'T KNOW HOW I SWUNG IT,

33:38.650 --> 33:41.553
BUT I MANAGED TO FILL
YOUR ENTIRE ORDER THIS WEEK.

33:41.587 --> 33:43.522
WELL, I CAN'T WAIT
TO TAKE A LOOK AT IT.

33:43.555 --> 33:46.558
OH, I'M SORRY.
I THOUGHT YOU WERE DR. ROYCE.

33:46.592 --> 33:48.227
AND DR. ROYCE THOUGHT

33:48.260 --> 33:50.729
THAT HE WAS GIVING HIS PATIENTS
CHEMOTHERAPY.

33:50.762 --> 33:53.232
SO DID ALL THE OTHER
ONCOLOGISTS ON YOUR ROUTE.

33:53.265 --> 33:55.134
W

33:55.167 --> 33:56.702
QUALITY CONTROL.
HANDS BEHIND YOUR HEAD, SIR.

33:56.735 --> 34:00.272
YOU HAVE THE RIGHT
TO REMAIN SILENT.

34:00.306 --> 34:03.275
IT'S MEANT FOR
A SPECIFIC PATIENT,

34:03.309 --> 34:04.643
THEY WOULD WHAT, DIE?
IS THAT WHAT YOU
WERE ABOUT TO SAY?

34:04.676 --> 34:06.245
HAVE YOU HEARD AND UNDERSTOOD
THESE RIGHTS

34:06.278 --> 34:07.346
AS THEY HAVE BEEN READ
TO YOU?

34:07.379 --> 34:11.217
Provenza:
YOU SEE, WALLY,

34:11.250 --> 34:12.551
THE ONES
THAT ARE STILL ALIVE.

34:12.584 --> 34:14.253
Tao: THEY HAVE CERTAIN THINGS
IN COMMON.

34:14.286 --> 34:15.387
NO HAIR LOSS, NO RASHES.

34:15.421 --> 34:16.855
ALSO, THEY'RE ALL DYING.

34:16.888 --> 34:19.825
THAT'S BECAUSE
THIS IS NOT A DRUG.

34:19.858 --> 34:22.261
TO THE CAMERA, PLEASE,
DOCTOR?

34:22.294 --> 34:24.163
I DON'T KNOW WHAT THIS MAN SOLD
ELSEWHERE ON HIS ROUTE,

34:24.196 --> 34:27.333
BUT HERE HE'S SELLING SALTWATER
TO CHILDREN WITH LEUKEMIA.

34:27.366 --> 34:29.635
Wally: NO, NO, NO, NO, NO.
LOOK...

34:29.668 --> 34:31.570
Y-YOU CAN'T SERIOUSLY THINK
I WOULD DO SOMETHING LIKE THIS.

34:31.603 --> 34:33.739
THERE MUST BE A PROBLEM
IN THE PIPELINE SOMEWHERE.

34:33.772 --> 34:36.708
NO MISTAKE, SIR.

34:39.378 --> 34:40.546
WE FOUND THESE DRUG LABELS

34:40.579 --> 34:41.813
AT YOUR APARTMENT
ON YOUR PRINTER,

34:41.847 --> 34:44.650
ABOUT 500 OF THEM.

34:44.683 --> 34:46.652
ON ACTUAL CHEMOTHERAPY
PRESCRIPTION VIALS,

34:46.685 --> 34:49.155
ONLY THE EXPIRATION DATES
HAVEN'T BEEN FILLED IN.

34:49.188 --> 34:51.157
WE ALSO FOUND OVER 50 GALLONS
OF SALINE SOLUTION

34:51.190 --> 34:53.825
IN YOUR SPARE BEDROOM,

34:53.859 --> 34:55.794
AND A REALLY EXPENSIVE
PRINTER.

34:55.827 --> 34:59.365
IT'S NOT ILLEGAL
TO HAVE THOSE THINGS.

34:59.398 --> 35:00.532
NOT REPORTING INCOME.

35:00.566 --> 35:02.334
YOU BILLED A LOT OF DOCTORS

35:02.368 --> 35:04.603
FOR MONEY YOUR COMPANY
NEVER RECEIVED.

35:04.636 --> 35:06.138
HELPS EXPLAIN
THAT $6 MILLION

35:06.172 --> 35:07.839
YOU HAVE IN
YOUR MERRILL LYNCH ACCOUNT.

35:07.873 --> 35:11.843
SOME OF IT INVOLVING
MEDICARE, MEDICAID.

35:11.877 --> 35:14.413
BUT WHAT WE DIDN'T FIND, SIR,
WAS THE, UH,

35:14.446 --> 35:17.349
METAL TROLLEY CASE
FILLED WITH, UH,

35:17.383 --> 35:19.651
SALTWATER THAT YOU WERE
ROLLING AROUND LAST WEEK.

35:19.685 --> 35:21.753
THIS ONE LOOKS
BRAND-SPANKING-NEW.

35:21.787 --> 35:24.156
WE FOUND A RECEIPT
ON YOUR CREDIT CARD --

35:24.190 --> 35:26.858
BOUGHT SATURDAY NIGHT,
7:07 P.M.

35:26.892 --> 35:30.662
PRETTY SOON
AFTER THE MURDER.

35:32.231 --> 35:33.499
OF COURSE, YOU NEEDED
TO CONTINUE YOUR BUSINESS --

35:33.532 --> 35:36.268
I HAVE THE WARRANT
FOR THE SPECIAL MASTER.

35:36.302 --> 35:37.836
YOU BETTER HOLD ON TO IT.

35:37.869 --> 35:40.406
ANN, WE MIGHT BE
USING IT AS A TEMPLATE.

35:40.439 --> 35:43.242
IF YOU SUDDENLY STOPPED
MAKING YOUR DELIVERIES --
TEMPLATE FOR WHAT?

35:43.275 --> 35:45.544
WELL, WE'RE GONNA NEED
40 MORE SPECIAL MASTERS --

35:45.577 --> 35:47.213
THAT WE KNOW OF --
MAYBE MORE.

35:47.246 --> 35:49.448
40?

35:49.481 --> 35:51.517
THAT'S HOW MANY ONCOLOGISTS
THIS GUY WAS SERVING, MA'AM.

35:51.550 --> 35:53.619
WANT TO SEE THE FACE OF
A MASS MURDERER, CAPTAIN?

35:53.652 --> 35:55.587
JUST TAKE A LOOK.

35:55.621 --> 35:58.324
AND YOU DIDN'T WANT ANYONE
TO NOTICE ANYTHING, DID YOU?

35:58.357 --> 35:59.525
DID YOU?

35:59.558 --> 36:01.793
NO.
I DIDN'T THINK SO.

36:01.827 --> 36:03.795
YOU MUST HAVE BEEN
REALLY ANXIOUS

36:03.829 --> 36:05.597
TO GET THINGS
BACK TO NORMAL.

36:06.832 --> 36:08.934
Tao:
AND THIS CASE HERE?

36:08.967 --> 36:11.303
YOU USED TO BASH IN
DR. BRADY'S HEAD.

36:11.337 --> 36:13.472
AND I BET THIS CORNER
MATCHES UP

36:13.505 --> 36:15.874
WITH THE WOUND WE FOUND
ON THE SIDE OF HIS SKULL.

36:15.907 --> 36:20.246
DON'T WORRY, SIR.

36:20.279 --> 36:22.381
I WONDER, WILL IT HAVE
THE VICTIM'S BLOOD ON IT?

36:22.414 --> 36:23.915
"VICTIM."

36:23.949 --> 36:26.618
WILL IT BE FILLED
WITH THE MEDICINE

36:26.652 --> 36:28.254
TO MAKE IT LOOK LIKE HE WAS
STRANGLED BY AN ADDICT?

36:28.287 --> 36:29.888
"MEDICINE."

36:29.921 --> 36:34.593
IT'S NOT MEDICINE.

36:34.626 --> 36:36.795
NOT MAKE YOUR HAIR
FALL OUT.

36:36.828 --> 36:39.465
NOT GIVE YOU DIARRHEA,
HEADACHES,

36:39.498 --> 36:41.333
AND STROKE, AND WASTING.

36:41.367 --> 36:44.703
MEDICINE DOESN'T DESTROY
YOUR SENSE OF TASTE,

36:44.736 --> 36:47.506
YOUR SENSE OF SMELL,
MAKE YOU VOMIT!

36:47.539 --> 36:50.242
THESE DOCTORS WERE NOT
GIVING A MEDICINE.

36:50.276 --> 36:51.710
THEY WERE
GIVING THEM POISON,

36:51.743 --> 36:56.615
TOXIC CHEMICALS PUSHED INTO
THEIR VEINS THROUGH AN I.V.,

36:56.648 --> 36:58.784
AND THEY WERE CHARGING THEM
FOR THE PRIVILEGE.

37:02.754 --> 37:05.657
THEY DIDN'T CARE
HOW MANY PEOPLE THEY HURT.

37:05.691 --> 37:09.595
YOU MURDERED HUNDREDS
OF CANCER PATIENTS!
I DIDN'T MURDER ANYONE!

37:09.628 --> 37:12.631
YOU TOOK AWAY THEIR ONLY
OPPORTUNITY TO SURVIVE!
THESE PEOPLE
WERE DYING ANYWAY!

37:12.664 --> 37:15.000
AND WHAT I DID DO, I HELPED
THEM ENJOY WHAT LITTLE TIME

37:15.033 --> 37:16.668
THEY HAD LEFT
AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE.

37:16.702 --> 37:18.804
AND WHEN THEY DID PASS AWAY,

37:18.837 --> 37:20.539
AT LEAST THEY STILL
LOOKED LIKE HUMAN BEINGS,

37:20.572 --> 37:22.040
NOT SOME DRIED-UP HUSKS.

37:22.073 --> 37:25.677
I SAVED THESE PEOPLE
FROM BEING TORTURED.

37:25.711 --> 37:27.379
THESE DRUGS...

37:27.413 --> 37:30.616
IT'S NOT MEDICINE.

37:34.686 --> 37:37.689
THAT'S NOT WHAT IT SAYS
IN YOUR INVOICE.

37:37.723 --> 37:39.858
YOU CHARGED FOR
BRAND-NAME PRESCRIPTIONS --

37:39.891 --> 37:41.560
NOT EVEN GENERIC.

37:41.593 --> 37:43.662
AND THE MILLIONS
IN YOUR BANK ACCOUNT,

37:43.695 --> 37:46.398
HOW MANY -- HOW MANY PATIENTS
DOES THAT REPRESENT?

37:51.337 --> 37:53.004
ASK MY LAWYER.

37:54.940 --> 37:56.375
HOW ABOUT THAT?

37:58.076 --> 37:59.578
IT'S MY CIVIL RIGHT.

38:02.681 --> 38:05.384
I GET A LAWYER.

38:05.417 --> 38:08.754
HUH
SEE, GABRIEL?

38:08.787 --> 38:10.856
YOU BETTER TAKE A LONG,
HARD LOOK AT YOUR LIFE CHOICES,

38:10.889 --> 38:11.857
MY FRIEND.

38:11.890 --> 38:13.759
COME ON.

38:13.792 --> 38:15.561
ATTORNEYS PROTECT US FROM PEOPLE
LIKE THIS, LIEUTENANT.

38:15.594 --> 38:17.496
PROTECT US

38:17.529 --> 38:19.465
IMAGINE WHAT WE WOULD DO
WITH A MAN LIKE THIS

38:19.498 --> 38:21.567
IF WE DIDN'T KNOW HE HAD
AN ATTORNEY COMING.

38:22.834 --> 38:25.637
THAT'S A GOOD POINT.
EXCELLENT POINT.

38:25.671 --> 38:28.507
HOW MUCH LONGER DID YOU INTEND
ON DOING THIS TO PEOPLE?

38:28.540 --> 38:30.576
YOU ALREADY MADE
$6 MILLION.

38:30.609 --> 38:32.778
YOU HAD $6 MILLION
IN THE BANK!

38:32.811 --> 38:35.714
CHIEF, WE NEED TO LEAVE.

38:35.747 --> 38:36.782
COULDN'T YOU JUST TAKE
THAT MONEY AND GO?

38:36.815 --> 38:37.983
HMM?

38:38.016 --> 38:39.551
O-OUT OF CURIOSITY,

38:39.585 --> 38:41.953
H-HOW MUCH MORE
WERE YOU WANTING TO MAKE?

38:41.987 --> 38:44.423
ANOTHER MILLION?
TWO
CHIEF.

38:44.456 --> 38:47.092
H-HOW MANY MORE PEOPLE
WERE YOU GOING TO LET DIE

38:47.125 --> 38:48.927
BEFORE YOUR BANK ACCOUNT
HIT THE RIGHT NUMBER?!
CHIEF. CHIEF?

38:51.997 --> 38:53.098
PLEASE.

38:55.701 --> 38:57.469
NEVER MIND.
I DON'T WANT TO KNOW.

39:16.555 --> 39:19.124
YOU WANTED TO SEE ME
BEFORE I LEFT?

39:19.157 --> 39:21.460
YES, I DID.
UM...

39:21.493 --> 39:26.031
YOU WERE RIGHT.

39:26.064 --> 39:29.034
LIST YOU AS ONE OF THE TOP 50
DOCTORS IN AMERICA.

39:29.067 --> 39:31.403
IS THIS SOME KIND
OF APOLOGY?

39:31.437 --> 39:33.439
NO. NO.
YOU DON'T DESERVE AN APOLOGY.

39:33.472 --> 39:35.774
A LOT OF PEOPLE DIED
WHILE YOU SAT ON YOUR HANDS.

39:35.807 --> 39:37.409
I DIDN'T HAVE PROOF.

39:37.443 --> 39:38.577
YES, YOU DID.
I WASN'T SURE.

39:38.610 --> 39:39.578
YES, YOU WERE.

39:42.981 --> 39:44.950
IS THERE ANYTHING ELSE?

39:44.983 --> 39:47.118
YES. UM, I NEED TO MAKE
AN APPOINTMENT WITH YOU.

39:47.152 --> 39:50.121
YOU'RE KIDDING ME.

39:50.155 --> 39:53.959
YOU'VE JUST MADE IT ABUNDANTLY
CLEAR WHAT YOU THINK OF ME.

39:53.992 --> 39:56.094
I'M NOT LOOKING
FOR A DECENT HUMAN BEING.

39:56.127 --> 39:59.064
I'M LOOKING FOR A GREAT DOCTOR,
AND...YOU'RE IT.

40:00.966 --> 40:04.770
IT'S -- IT'S NOT FOR ME.
IT'S, UM, IT'S FOR MY FATHER.

40:04.803 --> 40:07.839
HE'S, UM, COMING IN
TOMORROW AROUND NOON,

40:07.873 --> 40:12.878
AND, UH, AS SOON
AS HE GETS HERE --
I'M NOT TAKING ON
ANY NEW PATIENTS RIGHT NOW.

40:12.911 --> 40:14.846
YOU ARE GOING TO EXAMINE HIM

40:14.880 --> 40:16.815
AND FIND OUT WHY
HE'S NOT RECOVERING

40:16.848 --> 40:18.717
FROM HAVING HIS THYROID
REMOVED.

40:18.750 --> 40:20.852
HE'S HAVING
A-A TERRIBLE TIME,

40:20.886 --> 40:22.921
AND I'M AFRAID
THAT HE MIGHT DIE,

40:22.954 --> 40:25.591
AND I DON'T -- I DON'T KNOW
WHAT ELSE TO DO.

40:29.127 --> 40:31.029
DID THEY GET ALL
THE CANCER?

40:31.062 --> 40:33.699
THEY SAY SO, YES.
BUT...

40:35.266 --> 40:37.769
...he's not getting
any better.

40:42.508 --> 40:44.676
I CAN'T LOSE MY FATHER.

40:47.646 --> 40:50.115
PLEASE HELP ME.

40:50.148 --> 40:51.750
HELP ME.

40:52.951 --> 40:55.754
OKAY.

40:55.787 --> 40:57.556
OKAY.

40:57.589 --> 41:00.592
WE'LL SEE YOU AT...3:00?

41:00.626 --> 41:01.760
IS 3:00 GOOD?

41:01.793 --> 41:03.595
YES.

41:03.629 --> 41:04.896
3:00's VERY GOOD.

41:04.930 --> 41:06.097
GREAT.

41:09.234 --> 41:10.902
SO I CAN GO, THEN?

41:10.936 --> 41:13.138
YES. THANK YOU, DOCTOR.
I APPRECIATE IT.
