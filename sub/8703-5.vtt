* *

01:57.251 --> 02:01.690
Someone can see you now,
if you'll follow me.

02:06.060 --> 02:08.997
* *

02:26.848 --> 02:27.816
They're here.

02:27.882 --> 02:29.550
Yes, thank you.

02:29.617 --> 02:31.485
Welcome.
Please come in.

02:31.552 --> 02:33.521
Hello.
Thank you, Abby.

02:33.587 --> 02:36.390
Do you still need the binder?
I can't locate it.

02:36.457 --> 02:38.359
Well, it was there this morning.

02:38.426 --> 02:41.329
So maybe you could look again?

02:43.564 --> 02:46.167
Thank you so much.

02:46.234 --> 02:47.535
Sorry about that.

02:47.601 --> 02:50.004
Things are still a little
topsy-turvy around here

02:50.071 --> 02:52.273
with the recent tragedy, so...

02:52.340 --> 02:54.876
Please have a seat.
I'm Rochelle Baer.

02:54.943 --> 02:57.726
How can I help you?

02:57.746 --> 03:00.248
It-it was our understanding
that we would be

03:00.314 --> 03:02.751
speaking with the charge d'affaires.

03:02.817 --> 03:05.553
I am the charge d'affaires.

03:05.619 --> 03:07.255
Acting.

03:07.321 --> 03:09.758
The other charge d'affaires
is at the funeral.

03:09.824 --> 03:12.260
Maybe you haven't
heard our sad new...

03:12.326 --> 03:13.762
Yes, we heard.

03:13.795 --> 03:15.496
Well, what... what
is your position

03:15.563 --> 03:17.365
under normal circumstances?

03:17.431 --> 03:19.100
I'm the third secretary.

03:19.167 --> 03:21.770
- There's three secretaries?
- No, no.

03:21.836 --> 03:24.572
Uh, no, I'm to assume

03:24.638 --> 03:26.040
the duties of the charge d'affaires

03:26.107 --> 03:28.242
should he or she be
unable to do so themselves.

03:28.309 --> 03:30.759
And the charge d'affaires,
they assume the duties

03:30.779 --> 03:31.813
of the ambassador if the ambassador

03:31.880 --> 03:34.215
is incapacitated.

03:34.282 --> 03:37.251
Which... he is.

03:37.318 --> 03:40.121
So it was my understanding
that you needed to speak

03:40.188 --> 03:42.390
to someone about an urgent
matter and if that is,

03:42.456 --> 03:46.360
in fact, the case, I am the
authority that you're seeking.

03:50.799 --> 03:52.533
The night after we arrived...

03:52.600 --> 03:54.435
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, we are not...

03:54.502 --> 03:55.669
I am fucking doing this!

03:55.804 --> 03:57.906
It's what I have to do.

03:59.540 --> 04:00.975
The night after we arrived...

04:01.042 --> 04:05.013
Could you hold for just...
one moment?

04:13.855 --> 04:15.689
Please continue.

04:15.824 --> 04:17.458
The night after we arrived,

04:17.524 --> 04:22.163
our friend was shot in the head
by a guy in a cat mask.

04:22.230 --> 04:25.834
And we think that he's
connected to the police,

04:25.900 --> 04:28.569
um, local police.

04:28.636 --> 04:29.737
Our friend stole a boat.

04:29.838 --> 04:31.239
Before... before he got shot.

04:31.305 --> 04:33.174
And the boat was full of money.

04:33.241 --> 04:34.976
Drugs.
It was... it was drugs.

04:35.043 --> 04:36.244
- Yeah.
- On the boat.

04:36.310 --> 04:38.913
The Cat took my DNA.
He swabbed me.

04:38.980 --> 04:40.314
Yeah, okay, fine.

04:40.381 --> 04:42.050
Look, the boat was full of drugs.

04:42.116 --> 04:44.185
The money was given to us
by two Dutch drug dealers.

04:44.252 --> 04:45.854
They were part of a drug deal

04:45.920 --> 04:48.089
that was connected
to a man named Jesús.

04:48.156 --> 04:49.490
- We should talk about Sophia.
- Right.

04:49.557 --> 04:51.625
Right.
We've surmised that The Cat

04:51.692 --> 04:53.027
was also connected to Jesús.

04:53.094 --> 04:55.296
I-I didn't surmise that.

05:07.775 --> 05:09.911
- We're not safe here?
- Shh.

05:34.435 --> 05:36.804
Okay.

05:47.248 --> 05:49.050
Do you have the money?

05:51.986 --> 05:56.224
I need you to show me.

06:06.434 --> 06:10.939
Okay... okay.

06:12.206 --> 06:15.576
There's a dead police captain
in our pool.

06:18.512 --> 06:20.481
I'll follow you.

06:33.694 --> 06:34.943
Joel was over there.

06:34.963 --> 06:36.497
And we... and we were
all in the pool.

06:36.564 --> 06:39.968
She was about where you are
standing there and threatening.

06:40.034 --> 06:41.970
- She had that gun at us.
- Yelling shit.

06:42.003 --> 06:43.471
I think there was some cursing.

06:43.537 --> 06:45.339
Definitely some cursing.
She was cursing, she was...

06:45.406 --> 06:49.410
she was waving the gun,
really hostile.

06:49.477 --> 06:50.444
And then?

06:50.511 --> 06:52.680
And she said she was gonna kill us.

06:52.746 --> 06:56.250
She said she had to kill us
so we shot her.

06:56.317 --> 07:00.421
Joel.
I mean, Joel shot her.

07:04.758 --> 07:06.394
Where's the gun?

07:06.460 --> 07:08.429
I need the gun.

07:08.496 --> 07:11.199
The embassy is well aware
of her activities.

07:20.841 --> 07:22.443
Excuse me a moment.

07:24.712 --> 07:27.548
Uh, what... okay.

07:27.615 --> 07:29.083
She's gonna go look for the gun.

07:29.150 --> 07:31.319
- It's not there.
- Well, where is it?

07:31.385 --> 07:33.254
Just give her the gun so we
can get the fuck out of here.

07:33.321 --> 07:35.023
Yeah.

07:37.525 --> 07:39.007
She's not moving.

07:39.027 --> 07:40.561
Well, what is she doing?

07:40.628 --> 07:44.165
We said we were going to
tell the embassy everything.

07:44.232 --> 07:45.766
Yeah, full cooperation.

07:45.833 --> 07:47.635
"Joel shot her."

07:47.701 --> 07:49.603
You did.

08:11.559 --> 08:13.261
I believe you.

08:19.767 --> 08:21.269
I believe you.

08:26.740 --> 08:28.476
I believe you.

08:33.280 --> 08:35.549
Could you, please...

08:39.087 --> 08:40.621
I believe you.

08:42.655 --> 08:45.726
And I want to help, so here's
what we're going to do.

08:45.793 --> 08:48.629
We're going to take the money
to the Coast Guard station

08:48.696 --> 08:49.763
in San Pedro.

08:49.830 --> 08:51.499
They take custody
of any illicit monies

08:51.565 --> 08:52.866
and transfer it to
the State Department.

08:52.933 --> 08:54.502
That's protocol.

08:54.568 --> 08:57.338
From there, I will personally
drive you across the border.

08:57.405 --> 08:59.173
As I am the acting charge d'affaires,

08:59.240 --> 09:00.874
you will be under
my diplomatic umbrella

09:00.941 --> 09:02.810
and you will not be detained
in any way.

09:02.876 --> 09:04.745
I'm going to take you
to Guatemala City

09:04.812 --> 09:06.247
to the American Embassy there.

09:06.314 --> 09:09.283
There, they will take your statements

09:09.350 --> 09:11.852
and they will dispatch you home.

09:11.919 --> 09:17.758
Now, given the incendiary
nature of this incident,

09:17.825 --> 09:19.593
I suggest we leave immediately.

09:19.660 --> 09:20.694
Sounds good.

09:20.761 --> 09:23.964
So, it's just you.
Just Rochelle.

09:24.031 --> 09:26.134
It's not some other official.

09:26.167 --> 09:29.337
No... no, no, uh,
additional attaché?

09:29.403 --> 09:30.904
It's a bit unorthodox,
but given what we know

09:30.971 --> 09:32.706
about you-know-who, I think
the most important thing

09:32.773 --> 09:35.909
is getting you out of the
country quickly and quietly.

09:35.976 --> 09:40.681
And I, Rochelle, am the best
candidate for that.

09:42.015 --> 09:46.154
This is a good plan.

09:46.220 --> 09:48.689
Where is the gun?

09:48.756 --> 09:50.158
It's gone.

10:11.078 --> 10:13.314
You okay?

10:15.616 --> 10:18.519
I'll let you ride shotgun, all right?

11:10.938 --> 11:14.074
Uh, and this, please?

11:14.141 --> 11:18.312
And a pack of cigarettes.

11:20.481 --> 11:22.583
If not now, when?

11:24.151 --> 11:26.153
Oh, and, uh,
a pay-as-you-go phone.

11:26.254 --> 11:27.521
Oh, let me get one of those.

11:27.588 --> 11:30.258
- Oh, yeah. Me, too.
- Yeah, make it four.

11:30.291 --> 11:32.460
Only three left.

11:32.526 --> 11:34.895
You can use mine if you need to.

11:34.962 --> 11:37.531
Guys, text me your numbers.

11:40.934 --> 11:42.102
Okay.

11:42.169 --> 11:43.637
- Did you get it?
- Got it.

11:43.704 --> 11:45.172
Those don't make calls
for the States.

11:45.273 --> 11:47.174
Just so you know.

11:47.275 --> 11:49.310
Oh, well.

11:49.377 --> 11:51.345
It's still good to have, right?

11:51.412 --> 11:54.114
Yeah, you can call each other.

11:54.181 --> 11:56.183
Did you enjoy your stay?

11:56.284 --> 11:58.319
- Wonderful.
- Really fun.

11:58.386 --> 11:59.953
Wonderful time.

12:00.020 --> 12:02.390
We haven't heard much
from Mr. Milo since he retire.

12:02.456 --> 12:05.459
Me drop a package off the other day.

12:05.526 --> 12:08.195
Something he asked me to get for him.

12:08.296 --> 12:10.063
You know if he get it?

12:10.130 --> 12:12.400
A package?

12:12.466 --> 12:13.634
Me put it through the fence.

12:13.701 --> 12:15.969
Me want make sure he get it.

12:16.036 --> 12:17.938
Oh, oh.

12:18.005 --> 12:20.007
Yeah, yeah, he got it.

12:23.143 --> 12:24.445
Good.

12:24.512 --> 12:26.647
- Thank you, sir.
- Thank you.

12:44.765 --> 12:50.237
Hey, I just wanted you to know...

12:50.338 --> 12:51.972
you did the right thing.

13:08.889 --> 13:10.458
What is he doing?

13:11.392 --> 13:15.429
Hey! What are you doing?

13:22.603 --> 13:24.505
- Goddamn it.
- What?

13:24.572 --> 13:26.840
I got a head... I got
a migraine coming on.

13:26.907 --> 13:29.176
- I can feel it.
- You bring anything for it?

13:29.242 --> 13:30.644
Man, we... we gotta stop.

13:30.711 --> 13:32.646
Um, there... there's a
pharmacy in... in town.

13:32.713 --> 13:34.382
My apartment's in the other
direction, though.

13:34.415 --> 13:35.849
Why are we going to your apartment?

13:35.916 --> 13:37.618
- I have to get something.
- Pharmacy, please.

13:37.685 --> 13:38.986
All right, all right, all right.

13:39.052 --> 13:40.588
- Turn here.
- No, that's not the turn.

13:40.654 --> 13:42.690
- Turn here!
- Don't touch the wheel!

13:42.756 --> 13:44.372
- All right.
- That's not the turn.

13:44.392 --> 13:47.027
- That is the turn.
- That's the turn.

13:49.930 --> 13:51.031
Hey.

13:51.098 --> 13:53.266
You know, I'm about
to get on the road

13:53.401 --> 13:55.102
and I wanted to talk to my daughters

13:55.168 --> 13:56.770
and I was just hoping
I could use your phone.

13:56.837 --> 13:58.772
They're staying with
my ex-wife in Chicago.

13:58.839 --> 14:01.475
A whole country full of phones.

14:01.542 --> 14:03.744
Yeah, but, um, you know, I...

14:05.813 --> 14:08.416
...uh, I wanted
to use your phone.

14:08.482 --> 14:11.985
Hi, I'd like to purchase some Valium.

14:12.052 --> 14:13.421
How many?

14:16.023 --> 14:18.959
Comes loose or in a pack of ten.

14:19.026 --> 14:20.428
Ten.

14:22.863 --> 14:24.432
20.

14:28.201 --> 14:29.670
When in Rome.

14:29.737 --> 14:30.938
Ah.

14:31.004 --> 14:35.208
Hey, honey, it's Dad.
Listen...

14:35.275 --> 14:37.811
To send your message,
press one at any time.

14:37.878 --> 14:39.613
Hon... honey, it's...
it's... it's Dad.

14:39.680 --> 14:41.014
Your phone keeps cutting
me off, but I want...

14:41.081 --> 14:43.016
To send your message,
press one at any time.

14:43.083 --> 14:44.452
What the fuck!

14:58.466 --> 14:59.833
All right.

15:10.143 --> 15:11.812
What... what is
she doing up there?

15:11.879 --> 15:13.461
She said she had to get something.

15:13.481 --> 15:14.748
That's what she said.

15:14.815 --> 15:16.349
Maybe she's working for Jesús.

15:16.484 --> 15:17.585
Do you trust her?

15:17.651 --> 15:19.252
What, you think she's gonna pop us

15:19.319 --> 15:20.721
and leave us on the roadside?

15:20.788 --> 15:22.355
I don't know, that's a lot of money.

15:22.490 --> 15:24.091
$7 million.

15:24.157 --> 15:30.330
$7,618,311 U.S. minus the,
uh, 10 that Helena wired us.

15:30.397 --> 15:31.999
She's not motivated by money.

15:32.065 --> 15:33.767
No? Well, what then?

15:33.834 --> 15:37.505
A job well done, the
approbation of her superiors,

15:37.571 --> 15:40.340
the knowledge that with
this little coup,

15:40.407 --> 15:43.744
she will have handled the crisis
with bravery and aplomb

15:43.811 --> 15:47.515
and will ascend ever higher
on the ladder to nowhere.

15:47.581 --> 15:49.617
People like her are the reason
I quit teaching.

15:49.683 --> 15:51.499
I couldn't stomach the little fuckers

15:51.519 --> 15:53.020
with their pointless ambition.

15:53.086 --> 15:56.389
So our terrible misfortune
is a career boon for her.

15:56.524 --> 15:58.291
She did seem pretty fucking peppy,

15:58.358 --> 16:01.562
considering there's a dead
lady in the pool.

16:01.629 --> 16:03.931
I don't think she believed me
about the gun.

16:03.997 --> 16:05.999
Yeah, where is it, by the way?

16:18.111 --> 16:20.748
Okay. I'm coming.

16:20.814 --> 16:23.684
Sorry about that.

16:23.751 --> 16:25.318
Thanks for waiting.

16:25.385 --> 16:28.989
I, uh, I notice you don't
have diplomatic plates.

16:29.056 --> 16:31.258
Oh, yeah, you, you noticed that.

16:31.324 --> 16:33.561
Well, yeah, no, they're,

16:33.594 --> 16:36.764
they're coming next month,
apparently.

16:39.066 --> 16:40.968
Hey, uh, the fellas and I
had a little bet going,

16:41.034 --> 16:43.003
trying to figure out what
you were doing up there,

16:43.070 --> 16:46.774
- what you were getting.
- Oh, my passport.

16:46.840 --> 16:49.843
You never walk around
Belize with your passport.

17:11.665 --> 17:14.034
That's the jaguar preserve
over there.

17:15.836 --> 17:17.938
It's really amazing, actually.

17:18.005 --> 17:19.940
They're so beautiful up close.

17:21.473 --> 17:23.844
I'm sure you guys are just
glad to be going home, though.

17:26.512 --> 17:28.015
Yeah.

17:53.106 --> 17:54.942
You can sleep if you want to.

17:55.008 --> 17:57.477
Yeah, I was in bands
for most of my life, so I'm...

17:57.544 --> 17:59.312
I'm used to late nights.

17:59.379 --> 18:02.449
Up all night, I would only
sleep a few hours in a day.

18:02.515 --> 18:04.484
So you were into rock, then.

18:04.551 --> 18:05.853
You were, like, a rock guy or...

18:05.919 --> 18:07.988
Mm-hmm, rock guy.

18:08.055 --> 18:12.025
I've always wondered what
that kind of life is like.

18:12.092 --> 18:14.294
Especially when
I was younger, you know,

18:14.361 --> 18:15.896
like it's time to rebel or...

18:15.963 --> 18:18.265
I don't know,

18:18.331 --> 18:20.734
I've always been kind of
straight and narrow, I guess.

18:20.801 --> 18:22.502
In case you couldn't tell.

18:22.569 --> 18:24.137
That's good.

18:24.204 --> 18:26.707
I think it's good
that you're that way.

18:32.412 --> 18:34.815
- I sing.
- Really?

18:34.882 --> 18:40.087
Yeah. I mean, I...
I did in chorale.

18:40.153 --> 18:41.722
I love harmony.

18:41.789 --> 18:43.691
Harmony's wonderful.

18:43.724 --> 18:46.026
Yeah. There's this two-year
chorale college

18:46.093 --> 18:49.730
and, uh, I was going to go.

18:49.797 --> 18:52.399
But, I don't know, then I was like,

18:52.465 --> 18:54.167
what the fuck am I doing?

18:54.234 --> 18:56.804
You know, I've been accepted
to Stanford, for God's sake.

18:56.870 --> 18:59.272
...Well, you did the right thing.

18:59.339 --> 19:01.875
I am totally passionate
about diplomacy.

19:01.942 --> 19:03.877
I feel like I'm exactly
where I'm supposed to be.

19:03.944 --> 19:08.148
Careerwise, not,
you know, Belize, exactly.

19:08.215 --> 19:09.717
Well, you didn't miss anything,

19:09.750 --> 19:11.218
that kind of life or whatever.

19:11.284 --> 19:12.820
It seems like it's the only way to be

19:12.886 --> 19:16.323
at the time, but in reality...

19:16.389 --> 19:18.726
You didn't feel free?

19:18.759 --> 19:20.360
No.

19:25.598 --> 19:27.267
Sometimes.

19:30.503 --> 19:31.972
I'm sorry if I upset you.

19:32.039 --> 19:34.808
You didn't upset me.

19:34.875 --> 19:36.443
It's all ahead of you.

19:36.509 --> 19:41.281
Well, I mean,
it's all ahead of you, too.

19:41.348 --> 19:43.817
If you want it, right?

19:43.884 --> 19:45.618
Sing something.

19:45.753 --> 19:48.655
You guys should sing something
together, harmonize.

19:48.756 --> 19:50.523
No.

19:50.590 --> 19:52.760
Like the Captain & Tennille.

19:52.793 --> 19:55.763
I wonder if he still wears that hat.

20:11.678 --> 20:14.381
How they taste?
Taste good?

20:14.447 --> 20:17.117
Yeah, they're not so bad
if you have no tongue.

20:19.019 --> 20:22.722
Thanks.
Good to see you again.

20:33.533 --> 20:34.802
Ouch, ouch, ouch.

20:34.868 --> 20:36.736
Be careful, guys.

20:36.804 --> 20:39.639
Come on, just move it!

20:39.706 --> 20:42.075
Why did the refrigerator
cross the road?

20:45.312 --> 20:46.947
Come on, we don't have all day.

20:47.014 --> 20:49.116
- We gotta help them.
- What do you mean, help them?

20:49.182 --> 20:51.384
Cobi, we don't have time.

20:52.719 --> 20:55.288
Wait, wait, wait, wait, hold on.

20:55.355 --> 20:57.457
Here, let me help.

20:57.524 --> 20:59.759
H-Hey, hey, I'm here to help.

20:59.827 --> 21:01.661
I am a friend.

21:01.728 --> 21:03.096
Hey! Help!

21:03.163 --> 21:05.498
I can't do this alone!

21:07.835 --> 21:09.837
All right. Hold on.

21:09.903 --> 21:12.439
Watch your fingers,
watch your fingers.

21:12.505 --> 21:13.974
Move it!

21:14.041 --> 21:15.442
Okay. We're going up.
All right.

21:15.508 --> 21:17.010
- All right, come this way.
- Watch your head.

21:17.077 --> 21:19.446
- I got it. -I got it, I got it.
Okay. All right.

21:19.512 --> 21:20.647
Watch out, watch out.

21:20.713 --> 21:22.415
Watch out, watch out, watch out.

21:23.917 --> 21:24.885
Bring it down.

21:24.952 --> 21:26.186
Watch your fingers.

21:28.721 --> 21:30.290
Yeah!

21:30.357 --> 21:34.127
- We were going that way.
- Can you help us, please?

21:39.967 --> 21:41.849
One, two, buckle your shoe.

21:41.869 --> 21:43.136
Three, four, open the door.

21:43.203 --> 21:44.938
Five, six, picking up sticks.

21:45.005 --> 21:46.573
Seven, eight... ugh.

21:46.639 --> 21:48.175
Nine, ten, do it again.

21:48.241 --> 21:50.978
- Okay, here we go.
- Please don't dent my roof.

21:51.044 --> 21:52.212
One, two, buckle your shoe.

21:52.279 --> 21:54.314
Three, four, close the door.

21:54.381 --> 21:55.863
Five...

21:55.883 --> 21:58.018
One, two, three, four,

21:58.085 --> 22:00.954
five, six, seven and eight.

22:01.021 --> 22:03.090
One, two, buckle your shoe.

22:03.156 --> 22:04.892
Three, four, open the door.

22:04.958 --> 22:07.560
Five, six, picking up sticks,
seven, eight...

22:07.627 --> 22:08.561
Where do you live?

22:08.628 --> 22:11.798
In the mountains.

22:11.899 --> 22:14.001
There.

22:15.768 --> 22:17.404
Nice.

22:17.470 --> 22:19.907
Very nice.

22:19.973 --> 22:25.712
I'm going to go home soon,
have my lunch.

22:25.778 --> 22:28.781
Kiss your wife.

22:28.916 --> 22:30.951
That's right.

22:32.719 --> 22:34.687
I'm looking for my goats.

22:34.754 --> 22:39.092
Have you seen them?
They got little bells on.

22:42.762 --> 22:44.932
Perfect, yes!

22:44.998 --> 22:46.666
I think we got it.

22:46.733 --> 22:48.601
- All right.
- Good job!

22:48.668 --> 22:50.603
Show's over, Dumpling.

22:52.005 --> 22:53.506
- Bye, guys.
- Thank you, guys.

22:53.573 --> 22:55.275
Okay, thanks.
Bye, yeah, thank you.

22:55.342 --> 22:57.677
- Thanks, man.
- Thank you. Gracias, thank you.

22:57.744 --> 23:01.414
If you see my goats, tell them
it's time to come home.

23:06.353 --> 23:09.256
- All right, bye-bye.
- I got it.

23:09.322 --> 23:11.158
Here.

23:14.962 --> 23:17.497
Hey, man, what's your name?

23:17.564 --> 23:18.865
Hobo Joe.

23:18.966 --> 23:23.603
Hobo Joe. Solid.
Hey, what's your name?

23:23.670 --> 23:25.005
Hobo Joe.

23:25.072 --> 23:28.275
You're Hobo Joe, too?

23:29.542 --> 23:30.877
Wow, that's amazing.

23:30.978 --> 23:32.579
I want to be named Hobo Joe.

23:32.645 --> 23:34.247
- Stick with Homeless Lex.
- Fuck you.

23:34.314 --> 23:35.615
- Hey, oh!
- Guys,

23:35.682 --> 23:37.584
little pitchers have big ears.

23:37.650 --> 23:38.718
Sorry.

23:38.785 --> 23:40.353
You didn't hear that, did you?

23:40.420 --> 23:43.190
No, you... oh, okay, whatever.
What's your name, hmm?

23:43.256 --> 23:46.426
- Come on.
- Angelina.

23:46.493 --> 23:48.461
Angelina?

23:48.528 --> 23:51.798
That's a beautiful name.

23:51.864 --> 23:54.401
* Angelina, Angelina *

23:54.467 --> 23:56.803
* Please bring down your concertina *

23:56.869 --> 23:59.106
* And play a welcome for me *

23:59.172 --> 24:01.808
* 'Cause I'll be
coming home from sea *

24:01.874 --> 24:03.643
- Whoo-hoo!
- Whoo-hoo!

24:03.710 --> 24:05.378
* Hobo Joe, Hobo Joe *

24:05.445 --> 24:10.050
* You ride the rails
and you drink Sterno *

24:10.117 --> 24:12.419
* Hobo Joe, Hobo Joe *

24:12.485 --> 24:15.722
* Diabetes gonna take your big toe *

24:15.788 --> 24:17.724
- Oh, ho, ho!
- Everybody!

24:17.790 --> 24:22.495
* Angelina, Angelina, please
bring down your concertina *

24:22.562 --> 24:24.331
* And play a welcome for me *

24:24.397 --> 24:28.135
* 'Cause I'll be coming
home from sea. *

24:32.205 --> 24:33.640
Careful, okay?

24:33.706 --> 24:36.043
Good job.

24:37.210 --> 24:39.112
So this is where you live?

24:39.179 --> 24:41.148
I thought we were
bringing this to your house.

24:41.214 --> 24:43.250
You guys don't live here, do you?

24:43.316 --> 24:46.053
Pakt mit dem Teufel.
Pakt mit dem Teufel.

24:46.119 --> 24:47.420
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

24:47.487 --> 24:49.056
- No, no, no.
- Eas... easy, easy, easy!

24:49.122 --> 24:50.790
- What, what is he saying?
- Teufel, Teufel, Teufel!

24:50.857 --> 24:53.893
...Hey, cut that out, Hobo Joe 2.

24:53.960 --> 24:55.395
Teufel is a bad man.

24:55.462 --> 24:57.797
"Teufel" means "devil" in German.

24:57.864 --> 24:59.866
Is that what you're saying?
Are you saying "devil"?

24:59.932 --> 25:02.235
He cut off your hands.

25:02.302 --> 25:04.404
What are you talking about?

25:07.674 --> 25:09.642
Thank you, misters, thank you, lady.

25:19.919 --> 25:21.621
We got another fridge today.

25:21.688 --> 25:24.657
They didn't even lock
the door. How much?

25:40.407 --> 25:43.410
Family size, always in demand.

25:47.180 --> 25:52.152
Eins, zwei, drei, vier...

26:00.527 --> 26:02.962
The children told us
you had a misfortune.

26:04.331 --> 26:07.167
- What'd he say?
- A saw.

26:11.504 --> 26:13.206
Saw.

26:13.273 --> 26:17.210
He used to make furniture,
but now he does this.

26:20.713 --> 26:22.182
Here.

26:22.249 --> 26:23.850
The bad man chopped them off.

26:23.916 --> 26:26.919
The bad man chopped them off,
the bad man chopped them off.

26:26.986 --> 26:29.356
I told the children a fairy tale
by way of explanation.

26:29.422 --> 26:31.591
The bad man chopped them off.

26:31.658 --> 26:34.161
We couldn't make him hands of silver.

26:37.964 --> 26:40.367
No more detours.

27:03.856 --> 27:06.693
* *

27:19.572 --> 27:22.442
Hello?
Mr. Milo!

27:51.838 --> 27:53.740
* *

28:20.267 --> 28:22.134
Okay, guys, let's get going.

28:22.269 --> 28:23.135
- Border awaits.
- Okay.

28:23.270 --> 28:24.637
No, no, okay, okay.

28:24.704 --> 28:27.173
- Whoa. It's okay, it's okay.

28:27.274 --> 28:29.108
- No, no, Angelina, please.
- Gus!

28:29.175 --> 28:30.977
I'm coming.
It's okay, it's okay.

28:31.043 --> 28:32.779
Please, Ange...

28:32.845 --> 28:34.080
No, no, no.

28:34.146 --> 28:36.263
Okay.
Here, please, I'm sorry.

28:36.283 --> 28:38.385
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

29:03.310 --> 29:06.346
Hey, she'll be okay.

29:06.413 --> 29:09.349
Street kids here, they...
I don't know.

29:09.416 --> 29:10.617
They manage, you know?

29:10.683 --> 29:13.886
Yeah.
Just let them scavenge.

29:13.953 --> 29:15.888
Nothing we can do.

29:15.955 --> 29:19.359
Are you saying that there's
something I personally can do?

29:19.426 --> 29:20.993
No, I'm saying the embassy.

29:21.060 --> 29:22.595
I mean, there's an American
presence in this country.

29:22.662 --> 29:24.664
Yet the kids, everywhere
we go, they're begging.

29:24.731 --> 29:27.066
Some of them probably
being exploited.

29:27.133 --> 29:28.601
It's not our purview.

29:28.668 --> 29:29.769
Right, so we don't care.
I get it.

29:29.836 --> 29:32.171
Again, do you mean me personally?

29:32.238 --> 29:35.342
- Yes, you. I'm saying you.
- Gus.

29:38.177 --> 29:40.146
Hey, how much longer?

29:40.212 --> 29:43.015
About an hour.

29:45.485 --> 29:49.822
So, uh, what's next for
you after... after Belize?

29:49.889 --> 29:52.339
I don't know yet.
You just get assigned.

29:52.359 --> 29:54.761
You seem pretty fluent in German.

29:54.827 --> 29:57.797
Actually, I speak five languages.

29:57.864 --> 30:03.235
Six if you count Romanian,
which I don't.

30:03.302 --> 30:05.572
And Latin.

30:05.638 --> 30:09.942
I'm sure you've kind of thought
of, like, an ideal scenario.

30:10.009 --> 30:11.611
I have.

30:11.678 --> 30:14.714
You going to share it?

30:14.781 --> 30:17.083
I find your line of questioning odd.

30:17.149 --> 30:21.521
My line of... for just...
for taking an interest in...

30:21.588 --> 30:23.356
you know, I'm sorry
for being curious.

30:23.423 --> 30:24.957
Non-apology apology.

30:25.024 --> 30:26.659
I don't have anything
to apologize for.

30:26.726 --> 30:28.194
Then don't say sorry.

30:28.260 --> 30:30.397
Listen, I'm just saying
I know what it's like to be

30:30.463 --> 30:31.998
a minority in a competitive field.

30:32.064 --> 30:33.332
It's called relating.

30:33.400 --> 30:34.767
You can make a request,
though, right?

30:34.834 --> 30:36.969
I mean, this whole thing,
getting us to the border

30:37.036 --> 30:40.139
and everything and securing
the drug money,

30:40.206 --> 30:42.509
you can pretty much write your
own ticket after this, right?

30:42.575 --> 30:43.876
What are you insinuating?

30:43.943 --> 30:45.878
That you're ambitious
and that's a good thing.

30:45.945 --> 30:47.480
Rochelle, they're
just jealous 'cause you're

30:47.547 --> 30:49.248
gonna actually do
something with your life.

30:49.315 --> 30:51.918
Listen, I have done a lot more
with my life than you, okay?

30:51.984 --> 30:54.454
And I've done it with a hell of
a lot more opposition than you.

30:54.521 --> 30:56.055
Yeah, play the race card,
win the argument.

30:56.122 --> 30:58.625
Who said anything... look, first
of all, race is not a card.

30:58.691 --> 31:00.326
It's an experience.

31:00.393 --> 31:02.629
Okay, now that we've got that
clear, do you have any idea

31:02.695 --> 31:06.065
how much overcompensating
I have to do to make people

31:06.132 --> 31:08.901
like Rochelle feel comfortable?

31:08.968 --> 31:10.236
Excuse me.

31:10.302 --> 31:11.771
What, you don't think women
spend their lives

31:11.838 --> 31:14.306
making men feel comfortable?

31:14.441 --> 31:16.943
Be nice. Smile.

31:17.009 --> 31:19.846
Ha, oh, no, I'm sorry,
you were talking.

31:19.912 --> 31:22.515
Don't get emotional, don't get angry.

31:22.582 --> 31:24.250
Yes, please explain it to me.

31:24.316 --> 31:26.052
No, I'm... I'm not a threat.

31:26.118 --> 31:29.321
Oh, absolutely, gosh, I would
love to suck your dick.

31:33.059 --> 31:36.696
Oh, by the way, thanks for
staring at my legs earlier.

31:36.763 --> 31:38.731
Sure.

31:40.266 --> 31:45.938
My eyes happened
to be in this general area.

31:46.005 --> 31:49.008
Over-reactor.

31:49.075 --> 31:50.743
Um, wait, was...

31:50.810 --> 31:53.713
wasn't that the... the turnoff,
uh, San Pedro?

31:56.382 --> 31:58.918
Yeah, that's where you said
the Coast Guard station was.

31:58.985 --> 32:00.920
I'm gonna take you across
the border now while it's light

32:00.987 --> 32:03.089
and then I'll take the money to
the Coast Guard station later.

32:03.155 --> 32:04.857
But that's not
what you said originally.

32:04.924 --> 32:06.659
Well, originally,
we weren't going to drop off

32:06.726 --> 32:10.863
a refrigerator at
a Mennonite fencing operation.

32:10.930 --> 32:13.633
Listen, when you visually
assess a woman,

32:13.700 --> 32:15.702
that is threatening, okay?

32:15.768 --> 32:18.004
Yes, you, by the mere fact
that you could overpower her

32:18.070 --> 32:19.486
if you wanted to.

32:19.506 --> 32:21.908
Did you ever stop
to think that maybe,

32:21.974 --> 32:26.078
as a woman alone in a car
with four strange men,

32:26.145 --> 32:29.115
that your entitled gaze is,
in fact, hostile?

32:32.018 --> 32:34.787
I'm sorry...

32:34.854 --> 32:37.356
that you chose to wear a skirt

32:37.423 --> 32:40.392
and by the transitive power
of vision I saw your knee.

32:40.527 --> 32:41.961
I chose to wear a skirt

32:42.028 --> 32:43.630
because it's 90 degrees out,
you asshole.

32:43.696 --> 32:45.264
Hey, you know what?

32:45.331 --> 32:46.699
I think we should go back to
the, uh, Coast Guard station.

32:46.766 --> 32:48.000
I want to see you drop
that money off.

32:48.067 --> 32:49.569
So just turn around wherever you can.

32:49.636 --> 32:51.604
You did say that we were going
to go to the...

32:51.671 --> 32:53.039
You're not in charge here!

32:53.105 --> 32:55.207
Okay, look, I understand
that you took a lot

32:55.274 --> 32:58.811
of women's study classes
at Stanford and that even

32:58.878 --> 33:00.813
though you've had ever
possible opportunity,

33:00.880 --> 33:03.683
you still need to identify
yourself as a victim.

33:03.750 --> 33:04.917
I got that, okay, cool.

33:04.984 --> 33:06.819
But let me just get something clear,

33:06.886 --> 33:11.123
I do not, no, want to rape you.

33:11.190 --> 33:14.293
In fact, I wouldn't rape
you with Lex's dick.

33:14.360 --> 33:15.562
Hey!

33:15.595 --> 33:18.865
Oh, hey!
Have I gone too far?

33:18.931 --> 33:20.266
I'm sorry.

33:20.332 --> 33:21.834
Lex, are you gonna show her
what a good guy you are now?

33:21.901 --> 33:25.337
Hey, by the way,
your boyfriend back here

33:25.404 --> 33:26.573
wasn't always this sensitive.

33:26.606 --> 33:27.974
Hey, it's time to stop.

33:28.040 --> 33:29.776
Time... the voice of authority.

33:29.842 --> 33:31.844
- Time to stop, okay?
- What the...?

33:31.911 --> 33:34.581
- Okay, it's time to stop.
- Will you cut it out?

33:34.614 --> 33:37.564
- Cobi, Cobi!
- What the... stop!

33:37.584 --> 33:38.951
- Stop it! Stop it.
- Cobi.

33:39.018 --> 33:40.920
- Enough! Enough!
- Cobi, sit down.

33:40.987 --> 33:42.722
- Cut it out!
- Oh, shit.

33:42.789 --> 33:45.858
Get out of my car!
Get out! Everybody out!

33:45.925 --> 33:47.594
Get the fuck out of my car!

33:47.627 --> 33:48.628
- All right.
- All right.

33:48.695 --> 33:50.062
All right.

33:50.129 --> 33:52.732
Jesus Christ.

33:52.799 --> 33:55.067
What's up with the fucking slapping?

33:55.134 --> 33:56.803
Stay away from me.

34:01.173 --> 34:04.611
Uh, so, um...

34:04.644 --> 34:06.846
should we walk from here, or...?

34:13.620 --> 34:15.521
Okay, get back in the car.

34:15.621 --> 34:17.123
Get back...
get back in the car!

34:17.188 --> 34:19.992
Get back in the car!
Get back in the car!

34:28.635 --> 34:30.770
Whoa.

34:39.178 --> 34:41.246
Wait.
Where are we going?

34:54.293 --> 34:56.228
I have to pee.

35:07.406 --> 35:08.741
This is fucking creepy.

35:08.808 --> 35:10.209
So she just knew exactly
where to turn,

35:10.276 --> 35:12.812
- exact road to go down?
- She has to take a piss.

35:12.879 --> 35:14.981
She can't just squat
on the side of the road.

35:15.047 --> 35:17.383
Hey, I'm not comfortable leaving
the money with her.

35:17.449 --> 35:19.351
You're not comfortable
leaving the money, period.

35:19.418 --> 35:21.020
What's to say she won't take it?

35:21.087 --> 35:22.669
She's a nice girl.
She's a regular girl.

35:22.689 --> 35:23.790
She ain't that nice.

35:23.856 --> 35:25.191
You heard the shit she had to say.

35:25.257 --> 35:26.392
- You provoked her.
- I didn't provoke shit.

35:26.458 --> 35:28.127
You provoked her.

35:28.194 --> 35:30.677
My point is, she's not going
to steal seven million euros.

35:30.697 --> 35:32.431
Maybe she'd just take one million.

35:32.498 --> 35:34.033
Yeah, exactly.

35:34.100 --> 35:35.868
Let her fucking take...
let her take one, two, three...

35:35.935 --> 35:37.069
what the fuck do I care?

35:37.136 --> 35:38.270
I just want to get to the border.

35:38.337 --> 35:39.571
I want to go home.

35:39.706 --> 35:41.340
You know, one...
one would be smart.

35:41.407 --> 35:42.775
I bet you she speaks French.

35:42.842 --> 35:46.512
Swiss bank accounts,
accrue interest, retire at 35.

35:46.578 --> 35:47.613
And what difference would that make?

35:47.714 --> 35:48.815
Look, we earned that money.

35:48.881 --> 35:50.449
I wouldn't go that far.

35:50.516 --> 35:52.484
Hey, you have PTSD. Yeah.

35:52.551 --> 35:54.987
Joel, he's walking around
like a fucking zombie.

35:55.054 --> 35:58.024
My shoulder's fucked.
Pain and suffering, pal.

35:58.090 --> 36:00.727
So you want to keep
the money now and... and what?

36:00.760 --> 36:02.061
I... I don't know.

36:02.128 --> 36:03.763
I just don't want her to have it.

36:03.830 --> 36:04.964
She doesn't want it.

36:28.921 --> 36:31.590
Hey, it's the goats.

36:31.657 --> 36:34.761
The goats.

36:35.762 --> 36:36.796
The goats.

36:36.863 --> 36:38.530
See?

36:38.597 --> 36:40.666
His brain, completely gone.

36:40.767 --> 36:42.749
How'd they get this far?

36:42.769 --> 36:44.670
He's like a retard at a petting zoo.

36:44.771 --> 36:46.272
Do you think it's them?

36:46.338 --> 36:47.807
Uh, I don't know, man.

36:47.874 --> 36:49.675
I mean, what are the chances, right?

36:49.776 --> 36:51.911
They got the bells, though.

36:53.279 --> 36:54.981
Come on, goats.

36:57.349 --> 36:59.285
Yes, that's it.

37:30.249 --> 37:35.254
Go home, go home.
That's it, home!

37:47.699 --> 37:49.635
She's been gone a long time.

37:49.701 --> 37:53.873
- Rochelle!
- Rochelle!

37:53.940 --> 37:57.109
-Rochelle! -Rochelle!

37:57.176 --> 38:02.714
Rochelle, it's just us!
Not the Teufel.

38:02.849 --> 38:07.186
- Rochelle!
- Rochelle!

38:07.253 --> 38:08.855
Rochelle!

38:08.888 --> 38:10.389
- Whoa!
- Shit!

38:10.456 --> 38:11.657
Ah!

38:11.723 --> 38:13.725
Oh, oh, my God.

38:13.860 --> 38:16.428
Oh, shit! Shit.

38:16.495 --> 38:17.930
Oh, my God.

38:17.997 --> 38:19.665
What is that?

38:19.731 --> 38:20.967
It's a cave.

38:21.033 --> 38:22.534
Yo, that is one big-ass hole.

38:22.601 --> 38:24.236
Do you think the goats
went over the edge?

38:24.303 --> 38:26.305
Oh, who cares about
the fucking goats?

38:26.372 --> 38:28.507
Rochelle!

38:30.442 --> 38:31.743
Oh, hey.

38:31.878 --> 38:33.345
Look.

38:33.412 --> 38:35.147
Oh, yeah, she's definitely
the type that'd have

38:35.214 --> 38:36.682
a travel pack of Kleenex.

38:36.748 --> 38:37.917
- We should go down there.
- How?

38:37.984 --> 38:39.451
We should try!
I'm gonna try!

38:39.518 --> 38:41.520
- No, no.
- We can't leave her down there!

38:41.587 --> 38:42.889
Maybe she's not down there, Lex.

38:42.922 --> 38:46.092
You think she just went for a stroll?

38:46.158 --> 38:49.695
I don't see anything.

38:49.761 --> 38:52.031
Rochelle!

38:54.700 --> 38:56.302
You hear something?

39:03.342 --> 39:05.945
- She couldn't have survived.
- We can't leave her there.

39:06.012 --> 39:07.914
There's no way down.

39:09.048 --> 39:10.649
There's one way down.

39:10.716 --> 39:12.484
Wait a minute, wait a minute.

39:12.551 --> 39:13.719
Maybe we missed her.

39:13.785 --> 39:16.155
Maybe when we were headed this way,

39:16.222 --> 39:17.623
she was headed back that way.

39:17.689 --> 39:19.158
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

39:45.851 --> 39:48.988
* *

40:30.429 --> 40:31.964
Fuck.

40:34.566 --> 40:36.168
She took the keys.

40:40.306 --> 40:43.042
We should get our stuff
and start walking.

40:43.109 --> 40:44.576
Well, shouldn't we contact someone?

40:44.643 --> 40:46.278
Shouldn't... shouldn't
we tell someone

40:46.345 --> 40:48.480
so they could at least
come and get the body?

40:50.983 --> 40:52.351
No.

40:52.418 --> 40:56.322
Maybe... when... when
we're safe, we can...

41:09.235 --> 41:13.105
- So...
- No.

41:13.172 --> 41:15.341
Split four ways?

41:17.876 --> 41:21.413
$1,922,000 U.S.,

41:21.480 --> 41:24.030
minus the 10 that Helena wired.

41:24.050 --> 41:27.753
Look at you.
It's like you willed this.

41:27.819 --> 41:30.956
You're like... you're like
a fucking black magician.

41:31.057 --> 41:35.061
Lex, come on, Lexie.

41:35.094 --> 41:38.497
Jesus.

41:38.564 --> 41:40.366
If anybody willed it, it's Joel.

41:40.432 --> 41:44.050
He's the one who called the goats.

41:44.070 --> 41:47.339
So...

41:47.406 --> 41:49.075
Open a shell company.

41:49.108 --> 41:50.342
- No!
- Offshore accounts.

41:50.409 --> 41:53.245
No! No!
This is wrong!

41:53.312 --> 41:55.314
This is fucking wrong!

41:55.381 --> 41:57.083
She was trying to help us!

41:57.116 --> 41:59.318
We can't leave her body there.

41:59.385 --> 42:03.089
We can't just leave her
in a fucking hole.

42:03.122 --> 42:04.690
It's despicable!

42:07.659 --> 42:09.261
We can't help her.

42:20.839 --> 42:23.542
No one wanted this to happen,

42:23.609 --> 42:25.111
but it has.

42:27.913 --> 42:30.749
So I set up the shell company,
offshore accounts.

42:30.816 --> 42:33.985
We transfer the money once,
transfer it twice,

42:34.120 --> 42:35.321
and the money's in our respective

42:35.387 --> 42:38.357
Cayman accounts
early Tuesday morning.

42:43.729 --> 42:45.131
I don't want that money.

42:45.197 --> 42:46.998
I'll put your share
in an interest-accruing

42:47.133 --> 42:49.968
instant access account, Lex.

42:50.035 --> 42:52.204
If you need it, it's there.

43:28.039 --> 43:30.176
You guys okay?

43:31.510 --> 43:35.847
Uh... we need to get
to the border.

43:35.914 --> 43:37.216
Guatemala?

43:37.283 --> 43:40.586
My cousin can take you.
He's a fisherman.

43:40.652 --> 43:42.754
He's going to do
a delivery for me tonight.

43:42.821 --> 43:45.357
Um...

43:45.424 --> 43:47.293
Some of us don't have passports.

43:47.359 --> 43:48.727
Oh, no matter.

43:48.794 --> 43:51.177
The fishing boats go back
and forth all the time.

43:51.197 --> 43:54.266
No checkpoint.
Just reach.

43:54.333 --> 43:56.001
Climb in.

43:56.067 --> 43:58.337
Yeah.

44:00.572 --> 44:02.374
Thank you.

44:23.729 --> 44:27.433
Milo? Milo?

44:27.499 --> 44:29.301
The gate was open.

44:29.368 --> 44:31.737
Do you want me to set up out here?

44:45.251 --> 44:49.855
Hey, do you think
those guys are in love?

44:53.592 --> 44:56.895
If they are, they've got
a lot to overcome,

44:56.962 --> 44:58.397
I'll tell you that.

44:58.464 --> 45:01.933
Complete opposites,
except for the white pants.

45:02.000 --> 45:04.603
Good luck, ax guy, oar guy.

45:04.670 --> 45:06.638
Hope it all works out for you.

45:08.874 --> 45:11.510
I wish I knew what it said
at the bottom.

45:12.878 --> 45:16.282
"We are registered
at Crate and Barrel."

45:20.619 --> 45:24.270
I don't understand putting
anything down in Latin.

45:24.290 --> 45:28.093
Sub Umbra Floreo.

45:28.159 --> 45:31.563
Under the shadow, we flourish.

45:40.306 --> 45:43.842
¡Vámonos!
¡Vámonos!

45:50.816 --> 45:53.519
* *

46:17.843 --> 46:19.945
No. No, no, no, no, no.

46:48.374 --> 46:51.477
* *

47:11.397 --> 47:14.533
* *

47:44.996 --> 47:48.867
* Brown-skin girl, stay
home and mind baby *

47:48.934 --> 47:53.138
* Brown-skin girl,
stay home and mind baby *

47:53.204 --> 47:57.308
* I'm going away in a sailing boat *

47:57.443 --> 47:59.210
* And if I don't come back... *

47:59.277 --> 48:03.114
Hey! How much longer?

48:03.181 --> 48:05.250
About 30 minutes!

48:05.316 --> 48:08.319
* Stay home and mind baby *

48:08.454 --> 48:12.758
* Brown-skin girl,
stay home and mind baby *

48:12.824 --> 48:16.828
* I'm going away in a sailing boat *

48:16.895 --> 48:19.364
* And if I don't come back *

48:19.465 --> 48:23.602
* Throw away the damn baby *

48:23.669 --> 48:27.606
* Brown-skin girl,
stay home and mind baby *

48:27.673 --> 48:32.544
