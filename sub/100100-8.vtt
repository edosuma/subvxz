00:01.094 --> 00:02.784
Previously on "Batwoman"...

00:02.785 --> 00:06.143
Bruce never stopped looking
for your sister's body.

00:06.144 --> 00:09.015
Catherine Hamilton's investigators found

00:09.016 --> 00:11.051
skull fragments of a little girl.

00:11.052 --> 00:12.886
It's Beth.

00:12.887 --> 00:14.755
You never would have moved on

00:14.756 --> 00:17.124
if you didn't think that Beth were dead.

00:17.125 --> 00:20.127
I paid the DNA analyst
to write the report.

00:20.128 --> 00:22.629
As hard as I have tried
to get over you, I can't.

00:22.630 --> 00:24.431
It's definitely not fair to Tyler.

00:24.432 --> 00:26.867
Maybe it's best if I keep
my distance from now on.

00:26.868 --> 00:28.100
Daddy!

00:32.406 --> 00:34.307
Catherine seems to think so.

00:34.308 --> 00:35.909
We are to host

00:35.910 --> 00:39.980
the most memorable mad tea-party

00:39.981 --> 00:43.250
Gotham has ever seen.

00:43.251 --> 00:44.550
Ha ha ha!

00:47.921 --> 00:50.223
They say the choices we make define us,

00:50.224 --> 00:53.160
but despite all the darkness,
despite all those who doubt,

00:53.161 --> 00:56.129
and despite my own fear that
I've lost my sister forever,

00:56.130 --> 00:59.633
I choose to hope that
Beth is still there.

00:59.634 --> 01:03.069
Don't tell anyone, Bruce, but I
think this makes me an optimist.

01:15.115 --> 01:17.416
- Give me your jacket!
- Wait. What?

01:18.618 --> 01:20.654
Unh! Give me your jacket.

01:20.655 --> 01:22.789
This is vintage, bitch.

01:22.790 --> 01:25.158
Hyah!

01:25.159 --> 01:27.828
Okay. Take it, take
it, take it, take it.

01:44.811 --> 01:47.547
- Vintage.
- Thanks.

01:47.548 --> 01:50.016
Not exactly my style or size.

01:50.017 --> 01:51.852
Ooh. Is that blood? You
really shouldn't have.

01:51.853 --> 01:53.520
Front right pocket.
Rabbit dropped it in there

01:53.521 --> 01:54.712
before he made a run for it.

01:54.713 --> 01:56.838
Think we can use the
phone's GPS to track Alice?

01:56.839 --> 01:58.339
- I can try.
- Cool.

02:01.728 --> 02:05.298
I see you broke the staff in two.

02:05.299 --> 02:06.867
Like I wouldn't notice?

02:06.868 --> 02:08.869
Sorry. For the record,
it'd be a whole lot cooler

02:08.870 --> 02:10.203
if it actually came apart.

02:10.204 --> 02:13.173
It doesn't, though, so...

02:13.174 --> 02:16.676
Okay. Here is every location the
phone's gone to the past 7 days.

02:16.677 --> 02:18.678
Where's this?

02:18.679 --> 02:21.815
Ah. Slice of Gotham. Worst
breadsticks in the city,

02:21.816 --> 02:24.308
but location two is a
little more promising.

02:24.309 --> 02:26.253
It's a warehouse in The Bowery.

02:26.254 --> 02:28.221
Then that's where she is.

02:28.222 --> 02:29.488
Don't wait up.

02:37.864 --> 02:41.878
Ohh! Too sad, too loud, too mundane!

02:41.879 --> 02:46.172
Whaa! Why do I have nothing to wear?

02:46.173 --> 02:49.543
Ugh. If you're going to kidnap me again,

02:49.544 --> 02:53.246
do wait until I can dolly
up into something with, um,

02:53.247 --> 02:54.948
a little more flair.

02:54.949 --> 02:56.683
Did you hire The Rifle to kill me?

02:56.684 --> 02:59.553
Says the walking, talking, living girl.

02:59.554 --> 03:01.788
He shot someone that he
believed to be Batwoman

03:01.789 --> 03:03.147
with the coil accelerator,

03:03.148 --> 03:05.225
a weapon designed for only one reason...

03:05.226 --> 03:07.360
To kill me.

03:07.361 --> 03:09.062
The guy who designed it was found

03:09.063 --> 03:10.864
with a butterfly knife in his heart.

03:10.865 --> 03:12.766
Yeah. Mm-hmm. Let me rephrase that.

03:12.767 --> 03:17.537
So an evil man was trying
to kill my twin sister,

03:17.538 --> 03:21.440
and I ensured that that didn't happen.

03:23.877 --> 03:25.010
What is this?

03:25.011 --> 03:27.615
Uh, that is a multimillion-dollar
piece of technology

03:27.616 --> 03:30.383
that allows the coil accelerator
to penetrate your suit.

03:30.384 --> 03:32.648
That's the only one that
exists on the planet.

03:32.649 --> 03:34.454
Anyone who knew how to make it is,

03:34.455 --> 03:37.724
well, um, exactly that, past tense,

03:37.725 --> 03:40.660
so... you're welcome.

03:40.661 --> 03:43.063
Turn yourself in, Alice.

03:43.064 --> 03:45.665
Let me help you.

03:45.666 --> 03:48.501
I know my sister is in there.

03:48.502 --> 03:49.836
Oh, this again.

03:49.837 --> 03:51.503
You kept this...

03:53.807 --> 03:55.608
From the day of our bat mitzvahs.

03:59.613 --> 04:01.915
Take it and be gone.

04:01.916 --> 04:06.185
I am quite busy, and
I have nothing to wear.

04:21.267 --> 04:24.170
It's Kane. I'll be back
in Gotham later tonight.

04:24.171 --> 04:27.031
We'll go over the floor plan for
the gala first thing tomorrow.

04:27.032 --> 04:28.474
Talk then.

05:03.476 --> 05:06.246
So the way I see it you can either spend

05:06.247 --> 05:10.350
your Friday night in
here inhaling asbestos,

05:10.351 --> 05:13.687
or you could join me
in wearing this season's

05:13.688 --> 05:16.056
sexiest haute couture, hmm?

05:16.057 --> 05:20.926
Seriously, Gigi and Bella could not
even get their hands on this yet.

05:22.696 --> 05:24.564
You want me to go to that thing tonight.

05:24.565 --> 05:27.340
That thing is the
Gotham Humanitarian Gala,

05:27.341 --> 05:29.703
i.e. the most important
event of the season.

05:29.704 --> 05:32.906
Honoring your mom, who told
my dad that Beth was dead.

05:32.907 --> 05:34.607
Asbestos it is.

05:34.608 --> 05:37.277
I get that we are bordering on too soon.

05:37.278 --> 05:39.403
Hmm. Pretty sure we're
right in the middle of it.

05:39.404 --> 05:41.074
I know that this isn't important to you,

05:41.075 --> 05:42.916
but it's important to me, okay,

05:42.917 --> 05:45.185
so why can't it be important to
you that it's important to me?

05:45.186 --> 05:47.721
Because you think that if
Gotham sees us as a family

05:47.722 --> 05:49.046
that we'll start to believe it,

05:49.047 --> 05:50.590
and that's just not how it works,

05:50.591 --> 05:51.916
not after what Catherine did.

05:51.917 --> 05:53.393
But you gave Alice a second chance

05:53.394 --> 05:55.361
and a third and a fourth.

05:55.362 --> 05:57.564
How can you just write
off my mom as Satan

05:57.565 --> 05:59.390
but you don't seem to have any problem

05:59.391 --> 06:02.402
holding out hope for the actual
most evil person in Gotham?

06:02.403 --> 06:05.205
Because she's my family.

06:05.206 --> 06:09.776
And I'm not? Got it.

06:09.777 --> 06:12.412
I guess I am the crazy one, you know,

06:12.413 --> 06:15.615
for thinking that you and
I could still be sisters.

06:15.616 --> 06:17.317
Of course you're my family.

06:17.318 --> 06:19.119
It's just...

06:19.120 --> 06:22.222
Different? Yeah. Do yourself
a favor. Stop digging.

06:22.223 --> 06:24.591
Listen. Even if I wanted to go,

06:24.592 --> 06:26.760
I could never do that to my dad.

06:26.761 --> 06:30.563
You don't know? He
decided to come tonight...

06:30.564 --> 06:32.632
For me.

06:32.633 --> 06:35.100
Sorry for thinking that
you would do the same.

06:46.479 --> 06:48.782
You're going to the Humanitarian Gala?

06:48.783 --> 06:51.151
Yeah. I meant to talk to you about that.

06:51.152 --> 06:53.399
Unless Catherine somehow
didn't fake Beth's death,

06:53.400 --> 06:55.321
then I don't know what
there is to talk about.

06:55.322 --> 06:57.023
Hmm.

06:57.024 --> 06:59.073
- Are you getting back with her?
- Hmm.

06:59.074 --> 07:01.527
When you've been with someone
for a decade and a half,

07:01.528 --> 07:03.053
you don't just walk away.

07:03.054 --> 07:04.979
You're letting her weasel
her way back into your life.

07:04.980 --> 07:07.039
There's no weaseling, Kate.

07:07.040 --> 07:09.103
We've been spending some time together.

07:09.104 --> 07:11.095
When? You've been out of town.

07:11.096 --> 07:13.488
Oh. You know, we had
breakfast when I got back.

07:13.489 --> 07:15.448
You're seriously forgiving her?

07:15.449 --> 07:18.611
I'm not defending what
Catherine did. She's not either,

07:18.612 --> 07:20.847
but I'm beginning to
understand why she did it

07:20.848 --> 07:22.549
as a mother,

07:22.550 --> 07:24.017
as a wife.

07:24.018 --> 07:26.986
She thought she was helping us move on.

07:35.795 --> 07:39.632
Wake up, father dear.

07:39.633 --> 07:43.648
Hmm. Why, what a long sleep you've had.

07:45.639 --> 07:49.742
I thought it was high time you and I

07:49.743 --> 07:52.544
finally had a daddy-daughter chat.

07:55.215 --> 07:57.584
- That's all I want.
- Hmm.

07:57.585 --> 08:00.612
Oh, come on. Not like this.

08:00.613 --> 08:03.556
- Let me out of these chains.
- Shh.

08:03.557 --> 08:06.926
You're not the commander here...

08:06.927 --> 08:08.695
Commander.

08:08.696 --> 08:11.497
Kate will know I'm gone.

08:11.498 --> 08:13.733
Will she? Hmm.

08:13.734 --> 08:15.268
Because I saw her last night,

08:15.269 --> 08:17.937
and there was nary a mention of you.

08:17.938 --> 08:22.876
Guess she's 0 for 2 in
missing family members.

08:22.877 --> 08:27.714
What do you want me to say? I'm sorry?

08:27.715 --> 08:30.774
There is no word to
describe what it feels like

08:30.775 --> 08:33.253
to know that I left you behind.

08:33.254 --> 08:36.856
Then find the words to explain

08:36.857 --> 08:41.394
why you never tested the skull
fragments Catherine found.

08:41.395 --> 08:44.230
I had no reason to
think that she was lying.

08:44.231 --> 08:47.867
But your daughter was missing,

08:47.868 --> 08:51.304
and this was just a handful of bones

08:51.305 --> 08:56.042
found by some woman you'd
known for less than a year.

08:56.043 --> 08:58.611
Maybe believing that you were dead

08:58.612 --> 09:02.815
was easier than waking
up every morning with hope

09:02.816 --> 09:06.151
or going to sleep every
night with a broken heart.

09:10.290 --> 09:12.458
Of course, I should have looked longer.

09:12.459 --> 09:15.588
I should have hoped harder,
I should have... I should have

09:15.589 --> 09:18.131
had the DNA tested myself.

09:18.132 --> 09:22.035
I wish... I wish I could
have been your father

09:22.036 --> 09:25.838
for the past 15 years, but...

09:25.839 --> 09:28.741
I failed.

09:28.742 --> 09:30.442
I failed you.

09:34.180 --> 09:35.981
Thank you for saying that.

09:41.854 --> 09:44.257
And thank you

09:44.258 --> 09:48.628
for making me who I am today.

09:48.629 --> 09:50.997
What are you planning?

09:50.998 --> 09:55.301
Tell me what to do to stop it.

09:55.302 --> 10:01.174
Today is the day of my mad tea-party

10:01.175 --> 10:04.711
to which you've been invited.

10:04.712 --> 10:09.716
Hmm. I'm fairly certain you'll attend.

10:09.717 --> 10:13.653
Catherine will be delighted,

10:13.654 --> 10:17.790
but how can that be if you're stuck here

10:17.791 --> 10:21.728
and still the guest of honor?

10:21.729 --> 10:26.232
I guess you'll see as we drink tea

10:26.233 --> 10:29.402
and someone ends up

10:29.403 --> 10:30.836
a goner.

10:47.804 --> 10:49.701
Catherine manipulated
my dad 15 years ago,

10:49.702 --> 10:51.737
and here she is just doing it again.

10:52.978 --> 10:54.702
My dad is the head of The Crows.

10:54.703 --> 10:56.328
I mean, how is he even falling for this?

10:56.329 --> 10:57.979
Alice has been on a killing
spree since you got back,

10:57.980 --> 10:59.827
and this is what's got you
drinking Bruce's good stuff?

10:59.828 --> 11:01.375
Alice was brainwashed
against her own will.

11:01.376 --> 11:02.730
This is different. My dad is choosing.

11:02.731 --> 11:05.004
He is choosing to
forgive a woman who lied

11:05.005 --> 11:06.286
about the death of his daughter.

11:06.287 --> 11:09.156
Catherine paid a team of scientists

11:09.157 --> 11:11.285
to change DNA results.

11:11.286 --> 11:13.840
My dad once found a joint in my backpack

11:13.841 --> 11:15.275
and grounded me for a whole summer.

11:15.276 --> 11:18.512
It doesn't make sense. This is not him.

11:19.013 --> 11:21.713
- This isn't him.
- What am I missing?

11:26.309 --> 11:28.343
If you're calling with a
lecture, I don't have time.

11:28.344 --> 11:29.568
The opposite actually.

11:29.569 --> 11:31.557
I know complicated
better than anyone else,

11:31.558 --> 11:35.018
and if you want to work things
out with she who must not be named,

11:35.019 --> 11:36.677
it's not my business.

11:36.678 --> 11:38.300
Well, I appreciate that, kiddo.

11:38.301 --> 11:40.326
And in thinking about it, I realized

11:40.327 --> 11:42.585
that I never really
gave her a chance. Heh.

11:42.586 --> 11:44.826
Remember the wedding
and the big snowstorm

11:44.827 --> 11:48.063
and I just kept wishing that
maybe if we got snowed in

11:48.064 --> 11:49.708
you wouldn't have to get married?

11:49.709 --> 11:51.976
If only a snowstorm
were our biggest hurdle.

11:54.703 --> 11:58.573
Anyway, I just wanted to say
I'm sorry and have fun tonight.

11:58.574 --> 12:00.074
Thanks, Kate.

12:01.776 --> 12:04.045
My dad married Catherine on
the hottest day of the year.

12:04.046 --> 12:07.248
- So if that's not your dad, then...
- It's Mouse.

12:07.249 --> 12:09.684
So you know those
vacation days we banked?

12:09.685 --> 12:12.187
What if we took one of
our old-school road trips?

12:12.188 --> 12:16.358
I was thinking down
south, maybe Dollywood.

12:16.359 --> 12:17.692
Sounds cool.

12:17.693 --> 12:19.527
What is up with you?

12:19.528 --> 12:22.063
I just suggested a
road trip to Dollywood.

12:22.064 --> 12:23.932
Nothing's up with me.

12:23.933 --> 12:25.903
Nothing, or you're pretending to be cool

12:25.904 --> 12:28.805
about Kate and me and you're
obviously still freaked?

12:31.740 --> 12:33.936
Ty, if this is going to be a thing,

12:33.937 --> 12:35.276
we should talk about it.

12:36.968 --> 12:38.968
_

12:42.140 --> 12:44.075
Sorry to keep you waiting.

12:44.076 --> 12:47.245
I wanted to go over tonight's agenda.

12:47.246 --> 12:49.881
As you know, this is one of
the city's biggest nights,

12:49.882 --> 12:52.417
so I need you two to run point.

12:52.418 --> 12:53.918
Sophie, you take the Alpha team

12:53.919 --> 12:55.311
and cover the interior.

12:55.312 --> 12:58.223
Tyler, you're with Bravo
locking up the perimeter.

12:58.224 --> 13:00.309
Teams are already down in the theater

13:00.310 --> 13:02.527
- beginning their sweep.
- _

13:02.528 --> 13:05.330
I want this evening to
go off without a hitch.

13:12.337 --> 13:15.173
Good evening, Gotham.
Tonight is the city's

13:15.174 --> 13:17.742
Humanitarian Gala, which is rich person

13:17.743 --> 13:20.133
for "let's dress up and
congratulate each other

13:20.134 --> 13:21.613
on being rich and dressed up",

13:21.614 --> 13:23.847
and it's all to honor Hamilton Dynamics'

13:23.848 --> 13:27.352
matriarch of munitions
Catherine Hamilton-Kane.

13:27.353 --> 13:31.189
Not sure how they're gonna fit a
Tomahawk missile into a swag bag.

13:31.190 --> 13:34.425
So I'm en route to the
Humanitarian Gala with the rents.

13:34.426 --> 13:36.861
What uuup?!

13:36.862 --> 13:38.863
Where Mom is being honored

13:38.864 --> 13:41.599
as the Gotham giver of
the year... #prouddaughter.

13:41.600 --> 13:42.934
I just wanted to take a moment and say

13:42.935 --> 13:44.493
how thankful I am for family

13:44.494 --> 13:46.905
and for sticking by each
other through thick and thin.

13:46.906 --> 13:48.540
That's what it's all about.

13:48.541 --> 13:52.109
To Catherine, a most
extraordinary woman.

13:55.713 --> 13:57.815
Cheers.

14:07.158 --> 14:09.827
Ugh.

14:09.828 --> 14:11.930
Must be time to move. Ha ha!

14:11.931 --> 14:14.065
You are becoming incessant.

14:14.066 --> 14:16.301
And you are becoming predictable.

14:16.302 --> 14:17.936
Whatever you have planned for the gala,

14:17.937 --> 14:19.470
The Crows are already on to it.

14:19.471 --> 14:20.829
Tell me where Dad is.

14:20.830 --> 14:23.474
Or what? You'll have me arrested,

14:23.475 --> 14:26.477
institutionalized, killed?

14:26.478 --> 14:29.013
You hate him. I get it. I would, too,

14:29.014 --> 14:31.182
but he did not mean to hurt you.

14:31.183 --> 14:34.085
You keep holding on so tightly

14:34.086 --> 14:39.290
to the childish notion
that Beth is still in here.

14:39.291 --> 14:42.860
If Beth is gone, then
why did you keep this?

14:42.861 --> 14:45.049
You saved this for the
same reason you saved me

14:45.050 --> 14:47.265
from The Rifle.

14:47.266 --> 14:51.102
Because despite the hate,
the resentment, the rage,

14:51.103 --> 14:54.973
there's still good, there's still Beth.

14:54.974 --> 14:59.043
So tell me where Dad is.

14:59.044 --> 15:03.514
I left him in the same place he left me.

15:03.515 --> 15:06.284
Thank you.

15:06.285 --> 15:08.353
Kate.

15:08.354 --> 15:09.721
He's not doing so well.

15:09.722 --> 15:11.622
You might want to be quick about it.

15:18.563 --> 15:19.896
Dad?

15:34.358 --> 15:35.625
Hi.

15:39.964 --> 15:41.565
Good evening.

15:41.566 --> 15:44.435
I assume you have everything in order.

15:44.436 --> 15:46.903
10-4, Commander. All good here.

15:52.977 --> 15:54.412
Got to hand it to you, Mouse.

15:54.413 --> 15:55.713
That's impressive.

15:55.714 --> 15:57.581
If you're not Jacob,

15:57.582 --> 16:01.252
then you're...

16:01.253 --> 16:03.621
Not a Crow. Oh, crap.

16:04.990 --> 16:06.657
To date, the Hamilton Foundation

16:06.658 --> 16:08.967
has donated countless millions

16:08.968 --> 16:10.828
to fund work in the health,

16:10.829 --> 16:14.572
emergency relief, poverty,
and education sectors

16:14.573 --> 16:17.101
both globally and in Gotham.

16:17.102 --> 16:18.769
All of these philanthropic efforts

16:18.770 --> 16:21.333
are spearheaded by Catherine herself.

16:21.334 --> 16:23.669
I can think of no-one more deserving

16:23.670 --> 16:27.373
of the Gotham humanitarian
of the year award

16:27.374 --> 16:29.442
than Catherine Hamilton-Kane.

16:29.443 --> 16:31.177
Whoo! Ha ha!

16:36.749 --> 16:38.083
Whoo!

16:40.920 --> 16:43.889
Thank you, Dr. Campbell,
for that wonderful intro

16:43.890 --> 16:46.592
and to Mayor Akins
and the city of Gotham

16:46.593 --> 16:50.196
for this great honor.

16:50.197 --> 16:52.864
When I took over this
company from my father...

16:56.602 --> 16:59.138
Tyler. Tyler!

16:59.139 --> 17:01.941
Wake up!

17:01.942 --> 17:03.442
What happened?

17:03.443 --> 17:05.478
The commander tranqed us.

17:05.479 --> 17:07.747
What?

17:07.748 --> 17:10.148
Help! We're in here!

17:10.150 --> 17:12.084
One-way windows, soundproof walls.

17:12.085 --> 17:14.954
No one can hear us or see us.

17:14.954 --> 17:17.276
Kate was right. Alice's new minion

17:17.277 --> 17:19.157
is impersonating Jacob Kane.

17:19.159 --> 17:21.227
I'm still way too drugged
up to process that.

17:21.228 --> 17:23.395
Alice must be planning
something at the gala,

17:23.396 --> 17:24.797
which is why she took us out.

17:24.798 --> 17:26.965
I thought Alice was more of a...

17:26.967 --> 17:30.669
Slit open our necks and pose
for a tea-party type murderer.

17:30.670 --> 17:32.171
Ketamine's a little dull, no?

17:32.172 --> 17:33.672
She didn't want to hurt us.

17:33.673 --> 17:35.608
We're talking about
the same Alice, right?

17:35.609 --> 17:37.643
She's trying to preserve
some sick relationship

17:37.644 --> 17:40.145
with Kate, and killing me would...

17:43.082 --> 17:45.317
Killing you would mean
Kate would never forgive her

17:45.318 --> 17:48.754
because Kate's still in love with you.

17:48.755 --> 17:51.991
I have no idea.

17:51.992 --> 17:54.592
And what about you?
Any idea how you feel?

17:57.530 --> 17:59.610
We should probably figure
out how to get out of here.

18:02.768 --> 18:05.004
Today, Hamilton is a household name

18:05.005 --> 18:06.704
in technology innovation.

18:09.321 --> 18:12.821
_

18:16.471 --> 18:19.871
_

18:29.634 --> 18:30.926
She's fine.

18:30.927 --> 18:33.061
"Tonight...

18:33.633 --> 18:37.570
You honor me as one of Gotham's heroes,

18:37.571 --> 18:40.906
an honor that I...

18:40.907 --> 18:43.042
bought and paid for"...

18:45.078 --> 18:48.480
"Quite literally with... blood money.

18:48.481 --> 18:51.884
My company makes millions
by putting weapons of war

18:51.885 --> 18:54.219
in the hands of Gotham's criminals"...

18:56.355 --> 18:58.189
"And my husband...

18:59.825 --> 19:02.394
rakes in even more by
protecting you from them".

19:02.395 --> 19:03.553
Dad.

19:03.554 --> 19:05.598
"Quite the scam we've been running,

19:05.599 --> 19:07.233
wouldn't you say?"

19:14.907 --> 19:18.377
"What my husband
doesn't want you to know

19:18.378 --> 19:20.746
is that the true villains
of Gotham don't go

19:20.747 --> 19:23.415
by the name Joker,

19:23.416 --> 19:26.951
Riddler, or Alice".

19:28.754 --> 19:31.389
"Gotham's true enemies
are right in front of you".

19:37.296 --> 19:41.195
I... I... I...

19:43.436 --> 19:45.104
Mom!

19:45.105 --> 19:46.971
Mom, Mom, Mom!

19:52.726 --> 19:54.094
Orpheum Theater. We need medics.

19:54.610 --> 19:56.713
You hang in there,
sweetheart. You're okay.

19:56.714 --> 19:59.106
Hello? Something's happened to my mom.

19:59.107 --> 20:01.523
She's breathing, but we need
medical help immediately.

20:01.524 --> 20:03.925
You keep an eye over
them until I get back.

20:03.926 --> 20:05.960
Oh, my God. Where are you going?

20:05.961 --> 20:07.796
I'm gonna meet the medical
help and bring them here.

20:07.797 --> 20:10.932
- Okay. All right. Okay.
- Hang in there, sweetheart.

20:10.933 --> 20:13.201
Oh, my God.

20:15.471 --> 20:17.572
I didn't have a choice.

20:17.573 --> 20:19.908
It's okay.

20:19.909 --> 20:21.810
She made me.

20:21.811 --> 20:25.046
Stay with me. Help is on the way.

20:25.047 --> 20:27.382
Ladies and gentlemen, as we get medics

20:27.383 --> 20:31.286
for Mrs. Hamilton-Kane,
please stay in your seats.

20:31.287 --> 20:34.622
There's no cause for alarm. Please.

20:35.791 --> 20:36.991
Everything's under control.

20:36.992 --> 20:38.029
Stay in your seats.

20:38.030 --> 20:40.328
There's no need to panic.

20:40.329 --> 20:42.897
The Crows are holding us!

20:42.898 --> 20:44.765
Let us out!

20:46.134 --> 20:47.802
Okay. I'm in position.

20:47.803 --> 20:49.469
Batwoman's here. Let's bounce!

20:52.640 --> 20:54.942
Rrrraaahh!

21:13.628 --> 21:14.995
Aah!

21:27.008 --> 21:28.209
A little left.

21:28.210 --> 21:30.879
Trying. Nope.

21:30.880 --> 21:32.881
Other one.

21:32.882 --> 21:35.683
- Got it.
- Nice.

21:35.684 --> 21:37.412
Yeah. I'm really
regretting not getting you

21:37.413 --> 21:39.854
a bigger one of these in this moment.

21:39.855 --> 21:41.556
I wouldn't have wanted it.

21:41.557 --> 21:44.058
You sure you still want this one?

21:44.059 --> 21:45.217
Tyler.

21:45.218 --> 21:46.809
It's a little hard to ignore the irony

21:46.810 --> 21:48.830
of using the engagement
ring I got you to escape

21:48.831 --> 21:51.431
your ex-girlfriend's lunatic sister,

21:51.432 --> 21:53.307
who didn't kill us
because she knows more

21:53.308 --> 21:55.303
about your past relationships than I do.

21:55.304 --> 21:56.670
What do you want to know?

21:58.673 --> 22:00.875
What was it between you two?

22:00.876 --> 22:03.070
And don't say it was just
some drunk college hookup

22:03.071 --> 22:05.371
unless you were actually
drunk for 3 years.

22:15.390 --> 22:18.026
Look.

22:18.027 --> 22:20.261
All my life I followed the rules,

22:20.262 --> 22:23.597
my family's rules, the army's rules.

22:25.667 --> 22:27.480
This was the first time I broke one,

22:27.481 --> 22:30.705
and it almost cost me everything.

22:30.706 --> 22:32.072
That's why I lied.

22:34.375 --> 22:36.276
Didn't answer my question.

22:51.926 --> 22:53.393
Let's go get some help.

22:57.729 --> 22:59.488
Commissioner, with all due respect,

22:59.489 --> 23:01.089
I need your men to stand down.

23:01.090 --> 23:02.457
She's infiltrated The Crows.

23:02.458 --> 23:04.192
If you breach, we're all dead.

23:06.686 --> 23:08.645
Why isn't Jacob back?

23:08.646 --> 23:09.912
He'll be back soon.

23:19.508 --> 23:22.611
Your husband won't be joining you.

23:22.612 --> 23:25.280
Get me the tray.

23:25.281 --> 23:28.283
Catherine, you do not look so well.

23:28.284 --> 23:30.986
You stay the hell away from us!

23:30.987 --> 23:34.489
I'm not the one you should worry about,

23:34.490 --> 23:37.893
for "It was all very
well to say, 'Drink me',"

23:37.894 --> 23:40.162
but you should have first looked

23:40.163 --> 23:42.864
to see whether it's
marked poison or not.

23:42.865 --> 23:45.000
Oh! You poisoned her?

23:45.001 --> 23:48.503
Group effort. I used a
Catherine Hamilton recipe,

23:48.504 --> 23:50.163
project 4782.

23:50.164 --> 23:51.707
Ring any bells?

23:51.708 --> 23:53.475
4782?

23:53.476 --> 23:57.512
Catherine, do you want to tell her?

23:57.513 --> 24:00.816
I think her internal
organs are liquefying.

24:00.817 --> 24:03.685
I'll just tell you.
It's a deadly neurotoxin

24:03.686 --> 24:05.776
designed to kill without mercy.

24:05.777 --> 24:07.990
First, there is the dizzy spells

24:07.991 --> 24:11.426
and then nosebleeds and
then comes muscle paralysis

24:11.427 --> 24:13.595
and, uh, oh, respiratory failure,

24:13.596 --> 24:18.033
but lucky for us, Hamilton
developed an antidote.

24:18.034 --> 24:21.640
Okay. You just got to hold on
until we can get that antidote.

24:21.641 --> 24:24.576
Oh, no, my dear, I'm
confusing my stories.

24:24.577 --> 24:27.913
Hamilton never even bothered
to develop an antidote.

24:27.914 --> 24:31.082
If she dies, I'll kill you!

24:33.151 --> 24:37.589
She made a choice.

24:37.590 --> 24:41.193
Maybe if she'd made
better choices in the past,

24:41.194 --> 24:43.228
we wouldn't be here right now.

24:43.229 --> 24:45.530
You're just gonna let her die.

24:45.531 --> 24:51.281
Aw, Mary, my darling,
impetuous stepsister,

24:51.282 --> 24:53.570
I'm not a total monster.

24:55.105 --> 24:57.874
No. I found a solution,

24:57.875 --> 25:02.612
a universal cure-all
all the way from Coriana.

25:02.613 --> 25:03.980
Where's Coriana?

25:03.981 --> 25:07.283
Hmm. On a map or two.

25:07.284 --> 25:09.218
It's made from a desert rose that blooms

25:09.219 --> 25:11.154
only on the island.

25:11.155 --> 25:15.825
One prick of its thorn
can kill you on the spot,

25:15.826 --> 25:19.762
but harness the flower

25:19.763 --> 25:22.098
and nurture its serum,

25:22.099 --> 25:24.266
and it gives you life.

25:27.336 --> 25:29.071
What do you want?

25:29.072 --> 25:33.775
Hmm. A simple apology...

25:35.912 --> 25:40.516
for all the pain you've caused me.

25:42.486 --> 25:47.156
I'm sorry... Alice.

25:47.157 --> 25:49.424
I just don't believe you.

26:06.309 --> 26:08.444
Get me eyes on Alice and Jacob.

26:10.113 --> 26:12.982
She said she was sorry!

26:12.983 --> 26:16.152
You think I enjoy watching

26:16.153 --> 26:17.720
a daughter lose her mother?

26:17.721 --> 26:19.555
Gah!

26:19.556 --> 26:23.459
I was just inches from my own mother's

26:23.460 --> 26:26.927
severed head floating
down the Gotham river

26:26.928 --> 26:30.198
after our car plummeted off the bridge.

26:31.867 --> 26:34.203
Oh, please.

26:34.204 --> 26:37.006
Please just try.

26:37.007 --> 26:40.242
I can't lose you. Please just try.

26:43.079 --> 26:44.980
I'm a mother.

26:47.216 --> 26:49.819
Alice...

26:49.820 --> 26:52.888
When I saw Kate grieving,

26:52.889 --> 26:54.323
I saw my own daughter.

26:54.324 --> 26:57.893
I just wanted to take away her pain,

26:57.894 --> 27:00.278
but in trying to take away Kate's pain,

27:00.279 --> 27:01.697
I gave you a lifetime of it.

27:01.698 --> 27:05.768
It's all my fault, Alice.

27:05.769 --> 27:08.437
All the lost years, all
the agony you endured,

27:08.438 --> 27:11.774
it's all my fault. It's all...

27:11.775 --> 27:14.377
I'm truly sorry.

27:14.378 --> 27:16.611
Thank you, Catherine.

27:18.447 --> 27:21.017
I do believe you've earned
a draught of this tea.

27:21.018 --> 27:24.420
Oh!

27:24.421 --> 27:27.290
Oh, dear. Not you, too.

27:27.291 --> 27:30.092
What?!

27:30.093 --> 27:34.930
Uhh. No. What did you do? How did you...

27:34.931 --> 27:39.935
Tell me you didn't both
drink the champagne.

27:39.936 --> 27:42.071
Oh, that's such a shame,

27:42.072 --> 27:45.740
seeing as there's only
enough antidote for one.

27:54.100 --> 27:55.531
Dad drank the champagne, too.

27:55.532 --> 27:56.997
We need to go find him.

27:56.998 --> 27:58.853
He'll be fine. He knows better than

27:58.854 --> 28:00.855
- to poison himself.
- What?

28:00.856 --> 28:02.857
He poisoned you, Mary.

28:02.858 --> 28:04.392
Jacob would never hurt us.

28:04.393 --> 28:06.243
Hmm. Getting closer.

28:06.244 --> 28:08.979
You had someone impersonate him.

28:08.980 --> 28:10.747
What?

28:10.748 --> 28:12.416
The Skin Pirate.

28:12.417 --> 28:14.483
There is an escapee from Arkham.

28:18.088 --> 28:20.157
That wasn't Jacob in the limo.

28:20.158 --> 28:23.193
There you go.

28:23.194 --> 28:25.262
Now what were we talking about?

28:25.263 --> 28:30.167
Yes. The choices we make.

28:30.168 --> 28:31.934
Do choose wisely.

28:39.243 --> 28:43.113
Okay. Maybe if we split it,

28:43.114 --> 28:45.082
maybe we'll buy enough time

28:45.083 --> 28:46.583
to get to the emergency room.

28:46.584 --> 28:48.411
No, no. Alice would
have accounted for that.

28:48.412 --> 28:50.220
No. Mom, we have to try, okay?

28:50.221 --> 28:51.555
We have to try.

28:51.556 --> 28:55.225
Mary, listen to me. Drink it.

28:55.226 --> 28:57.561
No. There has to be another way.

28:57.562 --> 29:00.062
Mary, I am your mother.

29:01.465 --> 29:03.800
Ugh! Drink it.

29:03.801 --> 29:05.268
It's okay.

29:08.405 --> 29:09.639
Drink it.

29:26.424 --> 29:27.460
Did you do it?

29:27.461 --> 29:29.386
Jacob's drugged, and
I put him in the SUV.

29:29.387 --> 29:31.224
- Good.
- He doesn't know what happened.

29:31.225 --> 29:33.459
I have to go.

29:33.460 --> 29:37.230
You're too late.

29:37.231 --> 29:38.864
Where is my dad?

29:42.569 --> 29:46.739
Our... dad.

29:46.740 --> 29:48.741
You'll find out soon enough.

29:48.742 --> 29:51.075
Whatever you did, you can undo it.

29:51.076 --> 29:53.246
But I don't want to undo it.

29:53.247 --> 29:56.440
I was locked in a cell

29:56.441 --> 29:59.719
for 11 years.

29:59.720 --> 30:02.322
What do you think put
me to sleep at night,

30:02.323 --> 30:07.293
rainbows, unicorns?

30:07.294 --> 30:11.532
I dreamt of revenge.

30:11.533 --> 30:12.865
What did you do?

30:14.647 --> 30:16.449
What did you do?!

30:16.450 --> 30:21.287
"It was all very well
to say, 'Drink me',

30:21.288 --> 30:23.456
but the wise little Alice

30:23.457 --> 30:26.258
was not going to do that in a hurry".

30:29.195 --> 30:33.466
Oh, come on. It's not like
Catherine didn't have it coming.

30:33.467 --> 30:35.188
You poisoned Catherine?

30:35.189 --> 30:37.751
Catherine poisoned Catherine

30:37.752 --> 30:40.707
when she slithered into our family

30:40.708 --> 30:42.642
and brainwashed our father

30:42.643 --> 30:46.179
and replaced us with that vapid

30:46.180 --> 30:50.282
human run-on sentence of a daughter.

30:52.618 --> 30:56.022
Catherine brought this on herself,

30:56.023 --> 30:59.792
and I was more than happy to watch

30:59.793 --> 31:01.995
Daddy go down with her. Ha ha ha!

31:01.996 --> 31:03.529
Unh!

31:13.907 --> 31:15.874
Ha ha ha!

31:22.182 --> 31:23.815
That's what I thought.

31:31.257 --> 31:32.859
We need to go.

31:32.860 --> 31:34.927
One way or another, dear sister,

31:34.928 --> 31:36.595
you'll come to see my way.

31:43.703 --> 31:45.872
Hang on, Mom.

31:45.873 --> 31:48.174
They'll be here, they'll
pump your stomach,

31:48.175 --> 31:49.876
they'll find an antidote.

31:49.877 --> 31:52.177
You just got to hang on, okay?

31:55.381 --> 31:59.952
I always wanted to see you work

31:59.953 --> 32:02.889
in your clinic.

32:02.890 --> 32:05.458
How did you know about the clinic?

32:05.459 --> 32:07.393
I've always known.

32:07.394 --> 32:09.695
How come you never said anything?

32:09.696 --> 32:15.301
The fastest way for you
to stop doing something

32:15.302 --> 32:19.038
was for me to approve of it.

32:19.039 --> 32:21.307
Oh, my God.

32:21.308 --> 32:24.733
Do you know how many wardrobe
changes I did in that elevator

32:24.734 --> 32:27.480
thinking that I was fooling you?

32:27.481 --> 32:29.715
Cameras in that elevator.

32:29.716 --> 32:31.884
Ha ha ha!

32:31.885 --> 32:35.421
Mom?

32:35.422 --> 32:39.725
Mom. Shh. Yeah.

32:42.262 --> 32:46.432
- Mary...
- Yeah?

32:46.433 --> 32:49.301
You're the one thing I did right.

32:52.105 --> 32:55.108
Nothing makes me prouder

32:55.109 --> 32:56.942
than having raised you.

32:59.912 --> 33:02.648
I love...

33:02.649 --> 33:04.684
I...

33:04.685 --> 33:06.084
love...

33:10.456 --> 33:12.758
Mom? No, no, no, no, no, no.

33:12.759 --> 33:16.362
Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, stay with me.

33:16.363 --> 33:18.531
Wake up.

33:18.532 --> 33:21.467
Mom! Please!

33:21.468 --> 33:22.701
Mom!

33:37.967 --> 33:39.434
What is this?

33:42.471 --> 33:43.938
Ohh.

33:47.977 --> 33:50.913
- Kate.
- Who is this?

33:50.914 --> 33:53.783
What? It's... it's me, Kate.

33:53.784 --> 33:55.718
What did you get me
for my sixth birthday?

33:55.719 --> 33:57.987
- What?
- What was it?

33:57.988 --> 34:00.389
Ohh. It was, um...

34:00.390 --> 34:02.335
It was a bike that was too big for you.

34:02.336 --> 34:04.727
You wrecked it the same
day. What is going on?

34:04.728 --> 34:06.508
Alice and Mouse were at the gala.

34:20.822 --> 34:22.489
Get out of the car, Commander.

34:22.491 --> 34:25.192
- Dad?
- I'll call you right back.

34:28.429 --> 34:30.331
What's going on, Commissioner?

34:30.331 --> 34:32.331
Hands in the air, Kane.

34:43.411 --> 34:46.081
Commissioner.

34:46.081 --> 34:48.415
Jacob Kane, you're under arrest.

34:50.717 --> 34:52.719
I don't understand. What
are you talking about?

34:52.721 --> 34:54.255
I've never seen that before in my life.

34:54.255 --> 34:55.690
What the hell is happening?

34:55.690 --> 34:56.889
Get your hands off of me!

34:59.761 --> 35:01.689
Gotham is in shock tonight

35:01.690 --> 35:04.140
over the death of Hamilton Dynamics CEO

35:04.141 --> 35:05.533
Catherine Hamilton-Kane,

35:05.534 --> 35:07.926
allegedly at the hands of her husband

35:07.927 --> 35:10.105
and head of Crows security Jacob Kane.

35:10.106 --> 35:12.388
Her death occurred
just after some stunning

35:12.389 --> 35:14.840
and very public
admissions by Hamilton-Kane

35:14.841 --> 35:18.442
while accepting an award at
Gotham's Humanitarian Gala.

35:21.449 --> 35:22.783
Mary?

35:27.589 --> 35:28.922
Mary.

35:35.597 --> 35:38.298
Do you know how many horrible
people that I've saved?

35:40.468 --> 35:46.808
Druggies... thugs with face tattoos.

35:46.809 --> 35:49.544
Pulled a windshield out of a guy

35:49.545 --> 35:53.481
who stole the car that he totaled.

35:53.482 --> 35:55.283
Walked out of my clinic the next day

35:55.284 --> 35:59.087
like nothing had happened,

35:59.088 --> 36:02.223
but I...

36:02.224 --> 36:04.625
I couldn't save her.

36:06.327 --> 36:08.129
I am so sorry, Mary.

36:08.130 --> 36:10.398
You know how she died?

36:10.399 --> 36:15.069
Exactly the way that Alice planned it.

36:15.070 --> 36:16.570
Slowly...

36:19.240 --> 36:21.341
And in pain...

36:24.279 --> 36:26.413
And the only way for her to save herself

36:26.414 --> 36:28.807
was for me to die, and she sure as hell

36:28.808 --> 36:30.518
wasn't about to let that happen

36:30.519 --> 36:33.639
because she is not the horrible person

36:33.640 --> 36:36.324
that you and Alice claim that she is.

36:36.325 --> 36:39.194
You...

36:39.195 --> 36:41.492
You are literally the last person

36:41.493 --> 36:44.666
who can bring me comfort right now.

36:44.667 --> 36:46.434
I'm gonna ask you again, Kate.

36:46.435 --> 36:48.703
Is Alice worth it?

36:48.704 --> 36:49.871
No.

36:49.872 --> 36:52.207
Finally.

36:52.208 --> 36:53.840
Too bad it's too late.

37:01.549 --> 37:04.452
Agent Sophie Moore.

37:04.453 --> 37:06.988
Yeah. It's been a
late night for us, too.

37:06.989 --> 37:08.656
Just put me on with the Commissioner.

37:08.657 --> 37:11.492
He's got the wrong guy.

37:11.493 --> 37:14.229
Because I've got a dart
hole in my neck to prove it.

37:14.230 --> 37:15.693
Please have him call me.

37:18.000 --> 37:19.734
This is insane.

37:19.735 --> 37:22.036
How can they think he actually did this?

37:22.037 --> 37:23.471
People believe what they're told.

37:23.472 --> 37:24.973
It's human nature.

37:24.974 --> 37:27.208
Then people are idiots.

37:27.209 --> 37:30.044
- I should call Mary.
- I want kids.

37:30.045 --> 37:31.546
What?!

37:31.547 --> 37:35.236
And a dog and... family traditions

37:35.237 --> 37:38.419
that we bitch about but do anyways.

37:38.420 --> 37:39.887
Okay.

37:39.888 --> 37:41.380
I don't want to move past this today

37:41.381 --> 37:43.091
and then have it come
up again in two years

37:43.092 --> 37:45.168
and realize that I'm wasting my life

37:45.169 --> 37:49.163
fighting for something
I can't actually have.

37:49.164 --> 37:51.032
I don't want that either.

37:51.033 --> 37:53.201
Do you love me?

37:53.202 --> 37:54.936
Yes.

37:54.937 --> 37:58.106
Are you in love with me?

37:58.107 --> 38:00.374
Because if you love me, you'll
be real with me right now.

38:07.282 --> 38:08.782
I don't know.

38:18.293 --> 38:20.394
Let's not make this
any harder than it is.

38:24.899 --> 38:29.037
I think you need to figure yourself out,

38:29.038 --> 38:30.371
and when you do and if you see

38:30.372 --> 38:33.708
the same future I do,

38:33.709 --> 38:37.078
maybe I'll still be here.

38:37.079 --> 38:38.578
Maybe I won't.

38:52.995 --> 38:54.629
We all make choices, Bruce.

38:54.630 --> 38:56.964
I chose hope.

39:06.008 --> 39:07.522
And I chose to believe Beth

39:07.523 --> 39:09.077
was still alive.

39:09.078 --> 39:10.781
I chose to save my sister

39:10.782 --> 39:12.080
from the monster she's become,

39:12.081 --> 39:14.015
but by making that choice...

39:14.016 --> 39:16.784
I lost my entire family
for the second time,

39:16.785 --> 39:18.835
and now the only thing I'm left with

39:18.836 --> 39:21.322
is the awful truth that Alice was right.

39:21.323 --> 39:23.791
Beth is gone.

39:35.770 --> 39:39.273
My lawyer could only get us 5 minutes.

39:39.274 --> 39:42.844
I hate her so much, Dad.

39:42.845 --> 39:46.179
When I get out of here, I'm gonna
put her down once and for all.

39:48.282 --> 39:50.650
This time, I won't stop you.

- _

40:09.471 --> 40:12.507
across the multiverse to do one thing...

40:12.508 --> 40:14.909
Kill you,

40:14.910 --> 40:19.380
and now here, you save my life.

40:19.381 --> 40:24.819
Submit and begin your life anew.

40:24.820 --> 40:26.487
Show me.

40:26.488 --> 40:28.989
The knowledge is within you.
