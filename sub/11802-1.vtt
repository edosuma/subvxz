01:30.859 --> 01:33.706
Hello, Janice. Doctor Hamilton.

01:34.909 --> 01:37.121
Everything's gonna be okay.

01:37.221 --> 01:39.200
My baby.

01:41.539 --> 01:44.527
I need you to relax your stomach muscles.

01:45.430 --> 01:47.016
Okay.

01:47.266 --> 01:50.221
She's having a complete
placental abruption.

01:52.293 --> 01:54.549
What's wrong with my baby?

01:54.849 --> 01:58.171
Your placenta has dislodged
from the uterine lining.

01:58.271 --> 02:01.963
Which means your baby needs to
come out right now. Do you understand?

02:02.063 --> 02:05.804
I'm going to perform a C-section. Okay.

02:05.904 --> 02:09.323
- Call Ops, tell them we're coming down.
- Doctor Hamilton...

02:11.816 --> 02:14.465
Oxytocin's not working, can you...

02:14.905 --> 02:18.463
Doctor Hamilton. It's not her. It's you.

02:18.563 --> 02:21.413
Oh, shit! No!

02:21.903 --> 02:24.157
Oh, shit!

02:41.307 --> 02:43.528
There you are.

02:46.502 --> 02:48.889
Welcome to Unst.

02:50.133 --> 02:54.568
Thank you for doing this. I know adopting
in America would have been easier, but...

02:56.439 --> 02:58.826
I just want a baby.

03:00.880 --> 03:02.726
Come on.
Let me make you breakfast. Come on.

03:02.826 --> 03:05.308
Then I'll show you around the island.

03:30.305 --> 03:32.493
Beautiful, eh?

03:36.100 --> 03:39.458
Hey... what are these things?

03:39.558 --> 03:43.164
- I see them all over the island.
- You mean the runes?

03:43.264 --> 03:45.503
No, these, these carving things.

03:45.603 --> 03:49.176
Not ruins, I said "runes."
It's old Viking script.

03:49.276 --> 03:52.937
And you'll have to watch yourself as you
might have people make fun of your accent.

03:53.452 --> 03:57.527
- I don't have an accent!
- Spoken like a true American.

04:03.472 --> 04:05.810
Right now...

04:06.310 --> 04:10.687
we're north of the last inhabited house
in the UK. The closest train station...

04:10.787 --> 04:13.893
it's 300 kilometers that way, in Norway.

04:13.993 --> 04:17.082
- Really?
- Yeah.

04:17.617 --> 04:20.690
I used to come here when I was a kid.
It felt like the end of the world.

04:21.591 --> 04:23.846
What's that?

04:23.996 --> 04:28.488
Oh, that? That's Tronal Island.
That's where we'll be adopting our baby from.

04:31.147 --> 04:33.180
Are you okay?

04:34.033 --> 04:36.871
I just hate not knowing why.

04:42.366 --> 04:45.773
Excuse me.
I'm looking for Doctor Wickliff's office?

04:45.873 --> 04:48.629
Oh, he's on the third floor.
Just that way.

04:48.729 --> 04:50.491
Thank you.

04:50.591 --> 04:52.804
This is quite a CV.

04:52.904 --> 04:54.681
Thank you.

04:54.781 --> 04:58.696
I think you might find things a lot quieter
here at Saxa Vord than you maybe used to.

04:58.796 --> 05:02.490
- Well, I hope so.
- So how soon would you like to get started?

05:02.590 --> 05:07.184
- If you need a week or two to settle in...
- No, actually, I'd like to keep busy.

05:07.284 --> 05:09.870
Idle hands are the devil's playthings, eh?

05:11.274 --> 05:13.074
Something like that.

05:14.280 --> 05:17.729
We act as a fully functioning hospital
and all out patient treatments.

05:17.829 --> 05:21.865
We have Oncology, Pediatrics,
Coronary care,

05:21.965 --> 05:23.782
there's even a Psychiatrist on call.

05:23.882 --> 05:27.406
And then anything long term,
they transfer to Lerwick.

05:27.807 --> 05:30.044
And this is your office.

05:30.153 --> 05:32.633
Oh... nice.

05:35.322 --> 05:38.584
- What's in that wing?
- Upstairs is Dental,

05:38.684 --> 05:42.686
downstairs Physiotherapy and a Burns Unit
and in the basement we have the Mortuary.

05:42.786 --> 05:45.225
Oh, you certainly pack it all in.

05:45.325 --> 05:47.664
Well, you have your father-in-law
to thank for that.

05:47.764 --> 05:50.085
He prided himself on the care he provided.

05:50.185 --> 05:54.794
He said, "Just because we're an island,
doesn't mean people don't deserve the best."

06:01.641 --> 06:05.782
- Oh, yeah, there he is.
- Is that the heartbeat?

06:07.770 --> 06:09.827
Yes.

06:19.961 --> 06:22.467
<i>A toast to my only son and heir</i>

06:22.567 --> 06:26.156
<i>beautiful wife and to my future grandson.</i>

06:26.290 --> 06:27.727
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

06:27.827 --> 06:31.501
It's good to have you back, Duncan.
And, thank you, Tora, for bringing him.

06:31.601 --> 06:36.676
No, thank you, Richard, for everything,
for the house, for my job, for...

06:36.776 --> 06:39.652
- the adoption.
- It's what families are for.

06:39.752 --> 06:42.507
Anything you ever need,
please don't hesitate to ask.

06:42.607 --> 06:46.164
- How are you finding the islands dear?
- I think they're beautiful.

06:46.264 --> 06:49.738
- And the hospital? You're settling in?
- Ken treating you well, I hope.

06:50.138 --> 06:52.627
- He's a prick.
- Oh, Duncan!

06:52.727 --> 06:54.781
Why would you say that?

06:54.881 --> 06:56.956
Because he's licked dad's ass
since we were kids.

06:57.056 --> 06:59.989
He's modelled his entire career on him.

07:00.089 --> 07:03.349
You're criticizing the man
for knowing what he wanted?

07:04.534 --> 07:09.526
Who's for pudding?
I made your favorite, Duncan.

07:10.496 --> 07:12.550
Cranachan.

07:12.650 --> 07:15.906
- You spoil me, thank you.
- Tora, um...

07:16.006 --> 07:18.995
why don't you go
and help Elspeth with the coffee?

07:19.931 --> 07:23.976
- Not too much sugar, sweetie.
- Oh? Why is that?

07:24.356 --> 07:27.513
'Cause I had too many New York slices
got to lose a few pounds.

07:27.613 --> 07:30.101
- Oh!
- Nonsense.

07:30.201 --> 07:32.556
The world's gone diet mad.

07:37.900 --> 07:41.073
Oh, who's this? Is this you?

07:41.173 --> 07:46.281
No, that's Duncan's mother, Rose.
She died shortly after Duncan's birth.

07:47.503 --> 07:49.806
And is that the library?

07:50.609 --> 07:53.631
No, dear, that's Richard's study.

08:17.663 --> 08:20.051
Your dad doesn't know
you're diabetic, does he?

08:20.151 --> 08:23.223
And burst his illusion
that Guthrie men are perfect?

08:41.109 --> 08:44.600
And here we are. Tronal International.

08:44.700 --> 08:47.740
It's amazing to think
this is all just maternity.

08:47.840 --> 08:50.529
You'd be surprised how many women
need sensitive solutions

08:50.629 --> 08:54.520
to unfortunate or ill-timed pregnancies
even this day and age.

08:54.620 --> 08:57.476
And with us, we guarantee
their baby will be well cared for.

08:57.576 --> 08:59.964
That's one of the reasons
they come to Tronal.

09:00.064 --> 09:03.170
- What's the other reason?
- Anonymity.

09:12.703 --> 09:15.763
<i>So, who provides your obstetrics support?</i>

09:15.863 --> 09:19.492
We have a resident OBGYN.
A fellow of the Royal College.

09:19.592 --> 09:22.175
He has six fully qualified
midwives working with him.

09:22.275 --> 09:25.745
So, I can assure you
our clients are well cared for.

09:38.959 --> 09:42.331
Would you like some tea?
Or a dram of whisky?

09:43.150 --> 09:44.687
Uh, no, thank you.

09:44.787 --> 09:47.526
I'm sure your father
explained the process.

09:47.626 --> 09:50.532
You're set up with bank accounts
and jobs here on the island.

09:50.632 --> 09:53.805
Uh, why the twelve months
before we can adopt the baby?

09:53.905 --> 09:57.671
Well, that's to settle any residency
issues with the Scottish Government.

09:57.771 --> 10:01.056
We don't go giving our
wee nippers to just anyone.

10:01.336 --> 10:03.758
No, there's just the matter
of some filing fees

10:03.858 --> 10:06.295
and we can get you on the waiting list.

10:07.725 --> 10:10.238
- Is that your son?
- Aye.

10:10.338 --> 10:12.484
- He's very handsome.
- Thank you.

10:12.584 --> 10:14.664
We adopted him from Tronal, actually.

10:14.764 --> 10:17.411
Really? He's not yours?

10:19.624 --> 10:22.111
He has your eyes.

11:13.831 --> 11:16.102
Oh, no.

11:20.912 --> 11:25.546
<i>At the tone, record your message.
To end, please hang up.</i>

11:31.534 --> 11:36.652
Hi, this is Dr. Hamilton. I'm going to need
someone to cover my morning patients.

12:22.886 --> 12:26.776
Oh, Jesus. Oh, Jesus.

12:47.318 --> 12:49.055
Tora Guthrie?

12:49.155 --> 12:51.610
- Detective Inspector McKie.
- Hi.

12:51.710 --> 12:54.234
- This is D.S. Tulloch.
- Hi.

13:04.436 --> 13:05.855
What can you tell us, Steven?

13:05.955 --> 13:08.573
Well, at first glance,
what we have here are the remains

13:08.673 --> 13:12.703
of a female aged somewhere
between 25 and 35 years of age.

13:12.803 --> 13:15.724
Her skin has been tanned
by the peat, but...

13:15.824 --> 13:20.384
from her bone structure and the shape of her
skull I'm pretty sure that she's Caucasian.

13:20.485 --> 13:22.806
What are those markings?

13:23.306 --> 13:28.233
They look like runes that have either
been carved or branded into the flesh.

13:28.333 --> 13:31.256
From the position, I say they
couldn't have been self-inflicted.

13:31.356 --> 13:33.578
You sure about that?

13:34.429 --> 13:37.686
Sure as I am...
that she didn't die of natural causes.

13:46.637 --> 13:49.024
I had no reception. Are you okay?

13:58.978 --> 14:01.025
Did you hear that her heart was cut out?

14:01.125 --> 14:04.772
Gives me the creeps to think of her
lying downstairs right now.

14:31.543 --> 14:36.034
- What are you doing?
- Dr. Hamilton, you shouldn't be in here.

14:37.054 --> 14:39.599
I'm sorry. I... I just...

14:43.133 --> 14:46.990
You do realize this woman gave birth
shortly before she was murdered?

14:47.090 --> 14:49.563
This is a police investigation.

14:49.663 --> 14:53.202
No, that's okay. Go on, doctor.

14:56.108 --> 14:58.781
The uterus contracts...

14:58.881 --> 15:02.254
between one and three weeks after delivery

15:02.354 --> 15:05.035
depending on the age of the mother,
the younger the woman,

15:05.135 --> 15:06.413
the faster this happens.

15:06.513 --> 15:11.940
In my opinion, this woman gave birth
between a week to ten days before she died.

15:12.040 --> 15:13.527
You're sure about that?

15:13.627 --> 15:18.339
Well, if you look here, you can see that...
that she was nursing.

15:31.680 --> 15:33.600
Is she right?

15:34.853 --> 15:38.877
Hm, it seems your talents are wasted
on the living, Dr. Hamilton.

15:40.598 --> 15:43.069
So, what do we have so far?

15:43.169 --> 15:47.044
We only know that the victim's rib cage
was split open with some kind of blade

15:47.144 --> 15:50.785
and that she died of a massive hemorrhage
when her heart was cut out.

15:50.885 --> 15:52.672
Why take the heart?

15:52.772 --> 15:54.943
Maybe someone was trying
to harvest her organs.

15:55.043 --> 15:57.381
This was no harvest.

15:57.482 --> 16:01.322
Pulmonary trunk and semi aorta
were both quite badly hacked out.

16:01.423 --> 16:05.731
Also, there's trauma on the wrist
the upper arm and the ankle.

16:05.831 --> 16:07.669
Probably from some kind of restraints.

16:07.819 --> 16:11.307
So, she was probably still alive
when they did this to her?

16:12.196 --> 16:13.116
Jesus!

16:13.316 --> 16:16.482
Oh, these islands were rife
with this sort of thing way back when...

16:16.582 --> 16:20.343
the Druids, the Norsemen...
they all performed ritual sacrifices.

16:20.444 --> 16:22.347
Do you think she's that old?
I mean, she looks so...

16:22.448 --> 16:26.423
Preserved? Well, she's a bog body.
Buried in peat.

16:26.523 --> 16:31.048
After death... putrefactive bacteria
secretes digestive enzymes

16:31.148 --> 16:33.704
which decompose the body, but...

16:33.804 --> 16:36.208
sphagnum moss in the peat

16:36.308 --> 16:39.883
chemically reacts with the enzymes
and immobilizes them.

16:39.983 --> 16:42.369
If you have to guess?

16:43.457 --> 16:45.661
I found...

16:45.761 --> 16:49.183
these strawberry seeds in her stomach.

16:53.994 --> 16:58.168
Wild strawberries haven't grown
around these parts in over 200 years.

17:02.260 --> 17:04.800
200 years, that...

17:05.099 --> 17:07.170
hardly seems possible.

17:07.270 --> 17:09.107
Google Tollund Man.

17:11.445 --> 17:13.115
Dug up some time in the '50s.

17:13.214 --> 17:16.843
He was in such good condition that the Danish
thought that he was some recent murder.

17:17.123 --> 17:19.663
Turns out he was from the 4th Century BC.

17:32.320 --> 17:34.476
Hey. What are you doing?

17:34.576 --> 17:39.418
Oh, I... all this wood's rotten
I've got to throw it all out.

17:41.121 --> 17:43.009
What happened?

17:43.109 --> 17:46.028
Builder in the village said there was
a flood a couple of years ago,

17:46.128 --> 17:50.441
some big storm and the whole area
was underwater for three days.

17:50.541 --> 17:54.966
Seriously, I thought this place
would be a nice 12-month flip.

17:55.066 --> 17:56.703
Need a hand?

17:56.803 --> 17:59.930
You with a hammer? No.
Can you get me some pizza?

18:01.596 --> 18:04.701
- Thought you were off the slices.
- Yeah, well...

18:10.464 --> 18:12.201
Hey...

18:12.902 --> 18:14.851
when did you say this happened?

18:15.716 --> 18:19.798
Uh... early 2012.

18:20.734 --> 18:22.896
Are you sure?

18:23.205 --> 18:26.060
That's what he said. Why?

18:32.148 --> 18:33.726
Tora!

18:40.891 --> 18:43.430
Already did a thorough autopsy,
Dr. Hamilton.

18:43.530 --> 18:45.434
What's going on?

18:45.534 --> 18:48.740
If the peat bog floods,
its preserving abilities become diluted.

18:48.840 --> 18:51.374
Just take a look at the dates.

18:54.151 --> 18:56.915
So, if Jane Doe was in the ground
before the storm

18:57.015 --> 18:59.077
her body would be
in much poorer condition than it is.

18:59.177 --> 19:02.918
- The case is closed, Dr. Hamilton.
- Okay, well, what if I'm right?

19:03.018 --> 19:06.241
What if she was murdered
less than three years ago?

19:06.341 --> 19:08.329
You're not!

19:08.430 --> 19:12.637
Okay, so you're going to turn your back
on a sacrificial murder?

19:17.990 --> 19:20.663
Now, you listen to me,
and you listen to me good.

19:20.913 --> 19:24.011
Sacrificial, satanic, ritualistic.

19:24.111 --> 19:26.950
They're all words I don't want to hear.

19:27.050 --> 19:30.570
If you want someone dead,
you slit their throat

19:30.670 --> 19:32.753
or you put a pillow over their head.

19:32.853 --> 19:35.049
Maybe you blow their brains out
with a shotgun

19:35.149 --> 19:38.557
but you do not do
what was done to that poor girl

19:38.657 --> 19:41.762
and I don't care what you call it.

19:47.666 --> 19:49.975
What are you doing still standing there?

19:53.812 --> 19:57.453
<i>Well, what do you expect him to say?
He's just trying to keep a lid on things.</i>

19:57.553 --> 20:00.083
Tora, you've got to let it go.

20:00.784 --> 20:03.799
There is one question nobody's asking.

20:04.299 --> 20:06.501
What's that?

20:07.481 --> 20:09.991
What happened to the baby?

20:13.091 --> 20:14.934
Tora.

20:56.103 --> 20:59.167
- So when did you find it?
- This morning.

20:59.267 --> 21:02.857
But I'm pretty sure I haven't worn
those boots since that day.

21:03.117 --> 21:05.697
"Z.M. and J.H."

21:05.797 --> 21:08.385
Zoe McClaskey and Joss Hawick.

21:08.586 --> 21:10.791
Councilor Hawick?

21:11.091 --> 21:15.291
- You must be mistaken.
- Well, I checked the island records.

21:15.391 --> 21:17.504
You know how many women
whose names begin with Z

21:17.604 --> 21:20.427
have been married on this island
in the past 50 years?

21:20.527 --> 21:23.600
- No.
- 3. How many Z.M.'s?

21:23.700 --> 21:28.748
1. Plus there's a child and his age fits.

21:32.049 --> 21:34.304
Okay, I'll look into it.

21:34.405 --> 21:36.798
That's all I ask.

22:19.978 --> 22:21.716
Hey.

22:21.816 --> 22:25.148
- How are you feeling?
- Oh!

22:26.149 --> 22:27.143
I'm fine.

22:27.243 --> 22:30.572
That was a terrible thing,
you finding that body.

22:32.654 --> 22:34.950
You're tense as hell.

22:35.050 --> 22:36.830
Yeah.

22:37.831 --> 22:40.837
- Duncan.
- Guthrie!

22:40.937 --> 22:43.610
I was wondering when you were going
to show your face around here.

22:44.110 --> 22:46.621
Get your hands off my wife.

22:49.328 --> 22:51.191
Just being friendly.

22:51.291 --> 22:54.698
- What are you doing here?
- Lunch, remember?

22:54.798 --> 22:56.641
Right.

23:36.297 --> 23:40.540
So, you know you've got nothing
to worry about with Ken, I mean...

23:40.640 --> 23:43.835
No, I know, I know,
I just saw his hands on you, and I...

23:44.615 --> 23:46.441
Hmm...

23:50.443 --> 23:52.348
Hang on.

23:53.416 --> 23:55.658
Yeah, it's me.

24:13.121 --> 24:16.032
Are you writing to the Trowey folk?

24:18.131 --> 24:20.988
- Who?
- The Grey fellows.

24:22.590 --> 24:26.297
- Are you talking about these?
- Aye.

24:26.397 --> 24:28.836
What? You know what these are?

24:28.936 --> 24:30.890
Trowey marks, sure.

24:30.990 --> 24:34.898
- I'm sorry. What... what's a Trowey?
- The Trows...

24:34.998 --> 24:37.554
Jimmy! Leave the good doctor
alone, will you?

24:37.654 --> 24:40.615
No, no, it's okay. Really.

24:42.764 --> 24:44.568
Can you read these?

24:44.668 --> 24:47.139
- Aye.
- Jimmy!

24:47.490 --> 24:49.666
Away with you.

24:56.808 --> 25:00.872
Sorry about that, doctor.
He'll not bother you again.

25:06.578 --> 25:08.645
<i>The Trows, eh?</i>

25:08.748 --> 25:12.306
Now, why on Earth would you be
asking about these old stories?

25:12.407 --> 25:14.811
Oh, just curiosity.

25:14.911 --> 25:17.066
You want to be careful.

25:17.166 --> 25:19.477
You know what happened to the cat.

25:21.240 --> 25:23.846
I'm just joshing.

25:23.946 --> 25:27.657
Are you going to tell me why this sudden
fascination with our local folklore?

25:27.757 --> 25:30.648
Well, have you ever seen...

25:31.695 --> 25:33.538
these?

25:35.151 --> 25:39.009
- These are from the body you found.
- How do you know that?

25:39.109 --> 25:42.617
Because Andy McKie already
asked me to translate them.

25:42.717 --> 25:44.788
What are you doing with them?

25:44.888 --> 25:46.875
Well, I just...

25:46.975 --> 25:49.714
can't get them out of my head.
I wanna know what they mean.

25:49.814 --> 25:53.989
Well, therein lies the rub.
They're not from the Norse runic alphabet.

25:54.089 --> 25:57.564
So as far as I can tell,
they don't mean anything.

25:57.664 --> 26:00.703
I met a guy in a bar. Um, Jim somebody.

26:00.803 --> 26:03.659
He said he could translate them.

26:03.759 --> 26:07.082
- Jimmy McNally?
- Yeah.

26:07.182 --> 26:10.818
Well, I shouldn't set too much
store by what he says.

26:12.209 --> 26:15.516
You know we do have
a police force here, you know, Tora.

26:15.616 --> 26:19.946
It may not be much of one,
but, um... it works for us.

26:30.730 --> 26:35.338
You're looking really good
and I'll be seeing you in a month.

26:35.439 --> 26:38.501
And you get some rest, okay?

26:39.481 --> 26:42.620
Oh, Sergeant Tulloch.

26:42.920 --> 26:44.980
Come in.

26:47.597 --> 26:49.640
So, how bad is it?

26:50.686 --> 26:54.365
- You're six weeks along.
- Shit!

26:55.111 --> 26:56.854
Sorry.

26:58.769 --> 27:01.357
Not the reaction
you usually get, I'm sure.

27:01.458 --> 27:04.464
Well, it's early days.

27:04.564 --> 27:06.702
You still have options.

27:06.802 --> 27:08.994
No, I don't.

27:11.628 --> 27:16.443
I'm going to write you a prescription
for some pre-natal vitamins.

27:16.905 --> 27:19.393
I was praying it was stress.

27:19.494 --> 27:22.320
I should be so lucky, right?

27:24.787 --> 27:26.613
Thanks.

27:29.681 --> 27:31.523
Sergeant.

27:31.935 --> 27:33.989
Is there any news on the case?

27:34.089 --> 27:38.014
Oh, right, um,
I spoke to Councilor Hawick.

27:38.114 --> 27:40.936
He wasn't happy, obviously,
but I showed him the ring.

27:41.036 --> 27:45.285
He denied that it was his wife's.
Said hers was buried with her at St. Magnus.

27:45.863 --> 27:48.519
- So, she is dead.
- Three years ago.

27:48.619 --> 27:51.190
Some sort of horse riding accident.

27:51.290 --> 27:56.016
So, the time of death fits. If she had
the boy within two weeks of her death...

27:56.116 --> 27:57.453
She didn't.

27:57.553 --> 28:02.118
Mr. Hawick adopted his son, as a newborn
about 8 months after Zoe died.

28:02.378 --> 28:05.853
What about the initials, though?
She's the only one on the island that fits.

28:05.953 --> 28:07.703
Maybe that's the problem.

28:07.803 --> 28:11.598
We get thousands of visitors here every year.
They trample all over this island.

28:11.698 --> 28:15.088
Any one of them could be
the Z.M. that lost the ring.

28:15.188 --> 28:18.149
Probably there's nothing
to do with our Jane Doe.

28:20.265 --> 28:22.937
What? So, that's... that's it?

28:23.037 --> 28:26.026
We have no ID. The case is closed.

28:26.126 --> 28:29.512
Look, for what it's worth, I looked through
our database for the last 3 years

28:29.612 --> 28:33.357
and nobody matching Jane Doe's age
or height was reported missing.

28:33.458 --> 28:35.779
Well, what if she wasn't reported missing?

28:35.879 --> 28:39.426
Then I don't know what database
to look through for that.

28:40.789 --> 28:42.632
Thanks.

29:47.305 --> 29:49.347
Oh, dear.

29:51.396 --> 29:54.704
Doctor... would you let me
get that for you?

29:54.804 --> 29:56.793
Oh, would you?

29:58.294 --> 30:00.336
Thank you.

31:22.078 --> 31:24.818
Yeah? No, I'm here.

31:27.973 --> 31:30.016
Yeah, hang on.

31:48.481 --> 31:50.907
Okay, got it.

31:52.221 --> 31:54.832
Don't worry, it's been taken care of.

32:08.253 --> 32:10.508
Okay, Zoe.

32:10.608 --> 32:13.483
Let's see if your husband
was telling the truth.

32:37.061 --> 32:40.502
Let's try women between the ages of 16...

32:40.802 --> 32:44.516
and... 34.

35:15.528 --> 35:17.386
Shit!

35:37.922 --> 35:41.529
Oh, shit! Ah! Shi...

35:46.757 --> 35:48.276
Get off me!

36:21.309 --> 36:23.664
- Did you see the man's face?
- No.

36:23.764 --> 36:27.087
But it's pretty clear he didn't want me
getting out of there with that X-ray.

36:27.187 --> 36:30.761
- You stole this from the mortuary?
- I took it to see if I could find a match.

36:30.861 --> 36:34.117
And then Stephen Renney showed up
and took the rest of the autopsy file.

36:34.217 --> 36:35.855
But that's evidence,
that doesn't make sense.

36:35.955 --> 36:39.868
Oh, it will.
It will when you see who Jane Doe is.

36:42.526 --> 36:44.689
Theresa Renney?

36:44.789 --> 36:46.960
There must be a mistake.

36:47.060 --> 36:48.212
Why?

36:48.312 --> 36:52.538
'Cause Renney's wife died
of ovarian cancer in October 2011.

36:52.638 --> 36:55.544
There's no way she had a child.
You must have grabbed the wrong X-ray.

36:55.644 --> 36:57.047
I didn't.

36:57.147 --> 37:00.187
Look, I don't know what's going on
here but you now have a positive ID,

37:00.287 --> 37:03.519
so the question is
what are you gonna do with it?

37:04.954 --> 37:06.078
<i>I'll do the talking.</i>

37:06.178 --> 37:09.926
You found these on the corridor floor
and ran a search to match for filing, okay?

37:10.026 --> 37:11.824
Sure.

37:13.212 --> 37:15.434
Sir, some new evidence has come to light.

37:15.534 --> 37:19.258
Ah, Sergeant Tulloch, Doctor Hamilton.

37:19.959 --> 37:22.554
You both know Stephen Gair.

37:24.067 --> 37:27.040
Hello, Tora. How's Duncan?

37:27.541 --> 37:28.844
He's fine.

37:28.944 --> 37:30.881
If you don't mind, sir,
we need a private word.

37:30.981 --> 37:34.719
There's no need for that.
I filled him in on what's going on.

37:35.089 --> 37:36.793
Is that right?

37:36.893 --> 37:39.699
Last week a body was found
in your land, Tora.

37:39.799 --> 37:41.903
And my sympathies, by the way.

37:42.153 --> 37:45.411
The body was that of a young woman
who was brutally murdered a long time ago

37:45.511 --> 37:50.095
and whose remains are probably destined
for the Museum of Natural History.

37:50.195 --> 37:52.973
Yet despite the coroner's findings
the two of you have engaged

37:53.073 --> 37:57.435
in an unethical possibly illegal,
comparison of dental records.

37:57.535 --> 38:01.765
I believe you found a match to Doctor
Renney's late wife, Theresa.

38:02.360 --> 38:06.033
- How do you know?
- It's a small island.

38:06.711 --> 38:09.876
The problem, Mr. Gair, is that we've now
revised the estimate of time of death.

38:09.976 --> 38:15.136
It's irrelevant. Whether your Jane Doe
died last week or a thousand years ago...

38:15.236 --> 38:19.645
Theresa was under the supervision of the
finest doctors at Saxa Vord when she passed.

38:19.745 --> 38:24.956
She was then cremated.
There were over 50 people at her service.

38:25.156 --> 38:27.082
Including McKie here.

38:28.830 --> 38:30.473
That's true.

38:35.811 --> 38:39.178
You seem very sure
of Theresa Renney's medical records.

38:39.419 --> 38:43.465
That's because my own wife passed away
right around the same time.

38:44.745 --> 38:47.777
It was a very hard time for everyone.

39:14.212 --> 39:18.245
- <i>I'm telling you he's lying.</i>
- Oh, Tora.

39:18.345 --> 39:21.351
<i>Stephen Renney may have murdered his wife.
That doesn't bother you?</i>

39:21.452 --> 39:23.840
Yeah, yeah, of course, but...

39:23.940 --> 39:27.009
How could Renney's wife
be the body buried in our field

39:27.109 --> 39:31.060
when everybody saw it being buried
in the graveyard 6 months earlier.

39:31.581 --> 39:33.075
I don't know.

39:33.175 --> 39:36.164
<i>And how could she have a baby
when she's riddled with cancer?</i>

39:36.264 --> 39:38.545
Well, obviously, she couldn't.

39:38.645 --> 39:41.818
<i>Well, is it possible
that he faked her illness?</i>

39:41.918 --> 39:45.124
You can't fake Stage 4 ovarian cancer.

39:45.224 --> 39:49.188
Well, here's... here's a bigger question.
Why would he do it?

39:50.677 --> 39:54.067
- I don't know.
- Duncan!

39:54.167 --> 39:56.906
Yeah, look, I've got to go, okay.
I'll see you back at the house.

39:57.006 --> 39:59.633
- <i>Okay.</i>
- Bye-bye.

40:13.038 --> 40:16.120
You can leave your bags over there, Suzie.

40:16.320 --> 40:19.008
Can I help you with something,
Dr. Hamilton?

40:19.969 --> 40:21.773
Were you working here 3 years ago?

40:21.873 --> 40:25.997
No, I wasn't. I'm sorry,
did you want me to call Doctor Wickliff?

40:26.097 --> 40:28.458
No, it's okay.

40:29.822 --> 40:32.828
Now, remember,
she may not look quite herself.

40:32.928 --> 40:36.546
Your mother's lost a lot
of weight due to the chemo.

40:40.861 --> 40:43.095
It's okay, come here.

41:43.686 --> 41:48.011
Everybody knows that Theresa Renney
died of Stage 4 ovarian cancer, right?

41:48.111 --> 41:49.949
- Correct.
- So...

41:50.049 --> 41:55.744
how could she be in the hospital
and buried in my field?

41:55.844 --> 41:57.338
- She couldn't.
- Exactly.

41:57.439 --> 42:01.589
So what if Theresa Renney
was never in the hospital?

42:01.689 --> 42:05.229
- What do you mean?
- Have you ever been to an Oncology ward?

42:05.329 --> 42:08.335
Some of the victims
are so badly ravaged by cancer

42:08.436 --> 42:10.840
that their own families
barely recognize them.

42:10.940 --> 42:13.529
Are you saying he switched
his sick wife for someone else?

42:13.629 --> 42:18.092
I'm saying Theresa Renney
was never even sick.

42:18.192 --> 42:19.865
But why go to all that risk?

42:19.965 --> 42:23.500
There wasn't even any life insurance.
Her death cost Renney money.

42:23.600 --> 42:26.639
What if it wasn't about the money?
What if it was about the baby?

42:26.739 --> 42:29.583
Just... just take a look at this.

42:31.264 --> 42:34.738
"The Kunal Trows?" You know
these stories are told to wee bairns.

42:34.838 --> 42:40.254
Not this version. This was sent to me
by an expert at Oxford University.

42:43.130 --> 42:46.763
"The Kunal Trows were a patriarchal
warrior race of Shetland males

42:46.863 --> 42:51.764
"who believed themselves stronger,
healthier and smarter than ordinary men.

42:53.258 --> 42:55.764
"Unable to beget female children
to reproduce with

42:55.864 --> 42:57.951
"the Trows selected human females to marry

42:58.051 --> 43:02.527
"and the babies born of these unions
were always strong healthy sons.

43:02.627 --> 43:06.300
"Then nine days after delivery
and the Trows having no further use for them,

43:06.401 --> 43:10.727
"the mothers were sacrificed
by having their hearts cut out."

43:10.827 --> 43:13.082
"As part of the burial ceremony,

43:13.182 --> 43:18.255
"the mother's corpse had sacred prayers
carved into her flesh."

43:21.482 --> 43:24.557
- The details are remarkable, but...
- Well, the guy from Oxford

43:24.657 --> 43:27.427
thinks that the Trows
were a real religious sect.

43:27.527 --> 43:30.622
- Real?
- Yeah, what if they still are?

43:31.669 --> 43:34.780
And, what? You think
Stephen Renney is one of them?

43:37.881 --> 43:40.536
- I don't know.
- Yeah, well, I do.

43:40.636 --> 43:44.544
Look, it's the 21st century
and nobody would believe this stuff.

43:44.644 --> 43:45.737
It's crazy.

43:45.837 --> 43:49.452
All I'm saying is, there is something
weird going on on this island

43:49.552 --> 43:53.007
and you can't just ignore this.

43:54.397 --> 43:57.203
Oh, it's McKie, I have to get back.

43:57.303 --> 43:59.553
I'll see myself out.

43:59.992 --> 44:01.885
Look, I'm sorry, Tora, but...

44:01.985 --> 44:05.294
it's a small island and a group with
the kind of power you're talking about...

44:05.394 --> 44:07.763
they just couldn't hide.

44:29.534 --> 44:31.387
Ah, doctor, can I get you a drink?

44:31.488 --> 44:34.945
Actually, do you have an address
for Jim McNally?

44:35.045 --> 44:37.274
Drunk Jimmy?

44:37.374 --> 44:39.142
Yeah.

44:40.171 --> 44:42.719
Aye. I'll get you a pen.

44:47.369 --> 44:49.758
Aye. She's here right now.

44:49.858 --> 44:52.118
Asking about Jimmy McNally.

46:34.233 --> 46:37.640
- How was work?
- Exhausting.

46:37.740 --> 46:40.434
Had a problem with some of the machinery.

46:41.898 --> 46:44.008
Go back to sleep.

47:24.182 --> 47:27.740
- Inspector McKie.
- Dr. Hamilton.

47:27.840 --> 47:32.182
- What are you doing here?
- I was passing by, I saw the ambulance.

47:32.282 --> 47:36.496
- Can I be of any help?
- Well, not with this one, I'm afraid.

47:37.292 --> 47:39.472
What happened?

47:40.164 --> 47:42.809
McKIE: Drunken idiot must've fallen off.

47:44.039 --> 47:46.482
How do you know he was drunk?

47:47.045 --> 47:50.658
Old McNally, you have a hard time
finding him sober.

48:03.462 --> 48:07.168
Some of these roads are treacherous
after dark, doctor.

48:07.268 --> 48:09.679
You'd do well to remember that.

49:17.893 --> 49:22.625
So... what's so important we couldn't meet
at the station or your office?

49:24.707 --> 49:27.813
- What's this?
- Members of the Shetland Rite.

49:27.913 --> 49:30.034
And these dates next to them?

49:30.134 --> 49:33.129
Those are the dates
their first wives died.

49:34.910 --> 49:36.914
And the stars next to that?

49:37.014 --> 49:39.754
Those whose baby
either survived the mother

49:39.854 --> 49:43.115
or who adopted a son within 9 months.

49:44.112 --> 49:46.823
Your husband's father's name's
on this list.

49:47.853 --> 49:49.409
I know.

49:59.460 --> 50:03.322
What you're suggesting takes planning
and money. Lots of money.

50:07.158 --> 50:09.502
Password protected.

50:23.190 --> 50:25.194
What's that?

50:25.294 --> 50:28.172
Got it from a hacker back in Dundee.

50:30.054 --> 50:32.648
Oh, I should get one of those.

50:39.473 --> 50:41.165
Did you find anything?

50:41.961 --> 50:46.236
Nothing stands out in Renney's accounts.
They look in order, but...

50:46.737 --> 50:48.592
Hang on, what's this?

50:48.992 --> 50:51.437
Three payments from Gair's
account to something called

50:51.537 --> 50:55.054
- the Cathy J Morton Trust.
- Who's that?

50:55.154 --> 50:59.980
I don't know, but they add up to over
300,000 pounds. Look at the dates.

51:00.080 --> 51:04.139
September to October 2011.

51:04.239 --> 51:07.578
Right around the time
Theresa Renney reportedly died.

51:11.787 --> 51:13.407
Shit!

51:13.507 --> 51:15.770
That's the cops.

51:23.093 --> 51:25.069
Jesus, what are you doing?

51:25.648 --> 51:27.953
- Go out the back way.
- What about you?

51:28.053 --> 51:30.458
I'll be fine, just go.

51:55.374 --> 51:56.610
Dana?

51:56.710 --> 52:00.351
- That took forever.
- <i>Well, what did you tell them?</i>

52:00.452 --> 52:03.925
That I saw some kids leaving the building
and that it looked like a burglary.

52:04.225 --> 52:07.331
Anyway, I ran a check
on Catherine J Morton.

52:07.432 --> 52:10.538
- Guess what she died of?
- Ovarian Cancer?

52:10.638 --> 52:14.345
<i>Stage 4. Exactly the same
as Theresa Renney.</i>

52:14.646 --> 52:17.134
Anyway, I'm driving up to Oban now
to talk to the family

52:17.234 --> 52:19.255
to show them a picture of Stephen Renney.

52:19.355 --> 52:22.078
<i>If I hurry, I should make the last ferry.</i>

52:22.178 --> 52:25.167
Okay, look, Duncan's here. I should go.

52:25.267 --> 52:27.911
<i>So call me when you talk to them.</i>

52:29.493 --> 52:31.514
Go around, dickhead!

52:31.614 --> 52:33.851
Dana, you okay?

52:33.951 --> 52:35.881
Some arse thinks he owns the road.

52:40.632 --> 52:42.869
- He just hit me.
- What?

52:42.969 --> 52:45.750
- <i>He hit you?</i>
- What's going on?

52:49.516 --> 52:53.223
- He's following me.
- Well, pull over. Let him pass.

52:53.825 --> 52:56.048
No. I'm not stopping
in the middle of nowhere.

53:04.563 --> 53:07.858
Dana? Dana?

53:22.866 --> 53:25.276
Dana!

53:36.075 --> 53:37.996
Dana!

53:38.096 --> 53:40.351
Dana!

53:59.690 --> 54:01.920
That was McKie.

54:02.320 --> 54:04.755
They still have no leads.

54:05.568 --> 54:08.941
They should ask Stephen Renney
where he was last night.

54:09.041 --> 54:11.112
Tora, you've got to stop this.

54:11.212 --> 54:14.023
But if it was me out there,
you would stop?

54:23.671 --> 54:27.144
- That's an American accent, isn't it?
- Uh, New York.

54:27.244 --> 54:30.050
We went to Florida last year
with the nippers.

54:30.150 --> 54:32.922
Disneyland. Or is it Disney World?

54:33.022 --> 54:36.980
- I always get them confused.
- Yes, it's an easy mistake.

54:37.080 --> 54:40.325
Here, you, never mind her.
Just eat your breakfast.

54:41.773 --> 54:45.853
I'm sorry, I don't mean to be rude
but who did you say you are?

54:48.554 --> 54:53.062
My name is Dr. Tora Hamilton. I'm here
on behalf of Detective Sergeant Tulloch.

54:53.162 --> 54:56.870
Who I believe spoke to either you
or your wife on the phone.

54:56.970 --> 54:59.893
She was enquiring
about your sister-in-law.

54:59.993 --> 55:02.565
I thought nobody was gonna be coming.

55:02.665 --> 55:04.958
Who told you that?

55:05.972 --> 55:07.759
Look, Mrs...

55:07.859 --> 55:11.800
if you're not a police woman
then we don't have to answer anything.

55:11.900 --> 55:15.090
So if you'll excuse me,
I've got to go to work.

55:15.190 --> 55:17.996
Okay, Mark. May I call you Mark?

55:18.096 --> 55:20.434
You can call me whatever
you want while you're leaving.

55:20.534 --> 55:24.158
Well, if I walk out that door
the next knock you hear will be the police

55:24.258 --> 55:26.847
and they'll be asking you
all about the Cathy Morton Trust

55:26.947 --> 55:29.920
and how a single income family
living in a house like this

55:30.020 --> 55:34.143
are able to drive a brand new BMW
and taking Florida vacations.

55:39.906 --> 55:43.677
It all started when Stephen
saw her in the local paper.

55:43.997 --> 55:47.321
They'd written a small story
about ovarian cancer.

55:47.472 --> 55:49.730
He said he wanted to help.

55:49.960 --> 55:53.708
- Help? How?
- She was very ill.

55:53.808 --> 55:58.025
In bed all the time. Mark thought
she needed to be in a hospice.

55:58.125 --> 56:01.867
It was bad for the wee nippers.
Seeing their mum like that.

56:01.967 --> 56:05.555
He made her an offer, to take part
in some trials of a new drug

56:05.655 --> 56:09.449
and in return the drug company
would set up a trust fund for her children.

56:09.549 --> 56:14.058
It gets released monthly for things
like school uniforms and child care.

56:14.459 --> 56:16.713
We get none of it, you understand.

56:16.813 --> 56:19.384
So what happened after she agreed?

56:19.485 --> 56:23.226
Stephen paid the first instalment
like he promised.

56:23.326 --> 56:26.315
- And they came for her.
- Who came for her?

56:26.416 --> 56:28.654
An ambulance. A nurse.

56:28.754 --> 56:32.294
I don't really remember.
It all happened so fast.

56:32.394 --> 56:35.923
- Where'd they take her?
- We don't know.

56:36.737 --> 56:41.067
- Did you not go visit her?
- She died a few days later.

56:42.247 --> 56:44.653
Oh, what about the body?

56:44.753 --> 56:47.709
- Did you go to the funeral?
- There wasn't one.

56:47.809 --> 56:50.815
He said that had been part
of the agreement.

56:50.915 --> 56:53.787
Cathy's body would be used for research.

56:53.887 --> 56:56.652
How do you explain that to your child?

56:57.077 --> 57:00.668
So after Renney took her away
you never saw your sister again?

57:00.768 --> 57:03.607
- Who?
- Stephen Renney.

57:03.707 --> 57:08.316
- Who's that?
- I'm sorry. Who are we talking about?

57:08.417 --> 57:13.466
The man we were dealing with
was a lawyer. Stephen Gair.

57:18.637 --> 57:20.505
Look familiar?

57:20.605 --> 57:23.212
- Should she?
- Her name is Cathy Morton.

57:23.312 --> 57:26.352
Now she's the woman you all
watched die of ovarian cancer.

57:26.453 --> 57:29.709
Not... Melissa Gair.

57:31.042 --> 57:34.969
- What are you talking about?
- What I'm saying is that Melissa Gair

57:35.069 --> 57:37.405
is your Jane Doe.

57:38.075 --> 57:40.046
This is preposterous.

57:40.146 --> 57:42.440
Money doesn't lie.

57:48.864 --> 57:51.942
- Where'd you get this?
- From Dana.

58:09.755 --> 58:12.219
I wish we could hear
what his lawyer's telling him.

58:17.286 --> 58:20.015
Whatever it is, he doesn't look happy.

58:25.186 --> 58:27.006
Right.

58:27.106 --> 58:29.344
Let's get back in there.

58:29.445 --> 58:33.459
- What's she doing here?
- She refuses to leave.

58:34.622 --> 58:38.000
Put her in my office.
Give her a cup of tea or something.

58:49.084 --> 58:51.138
My daughters.

58:51.238 --> 58:53.527
They're beautiful.

58:54.327 --> 58:56.821
Aye, they take after their mother.

58:57.000 --> 58:59.661
Please, take a seat.

59:05.984 --> 59:09.475
I don't normally include civilians
at this stage of an investigation.

59:09.675 --> 59:11.916
But in your case...

59:12.016 --> 59:15.904
it seems only fair to tell you that
Stephen Gair gave us a full confession.

59:16.004 --> 59:17.273
What did he confess to?

59:17.373 --> 59:20.279
Well, the murder
of Sergeant Tulloch for starters.

59:20.379 --> 59:22.377
He knew his computer had been accessed.

59:22.478 --> 59:25.273
And he was worried in case she was, uh...

59:25.373 --> 59:27.411
figuring everything out.

59:27.511 --> 59:31.724
- About the Shetland Rite?
- About his money laundering scheme.

59:32.955 --> 59:34.664
What?

59:35.242 --> 59:38.533
He murdered his wife Melissa because
she was threatening to expose him.

59:38.633 --> 59:42.674
Unless he paid millions in the divorce.
Knew the house was empty.

59:42.774 --> 59:47.133
He kept Melissa there until she
gave birth, then he killed her.

59:47.233 --> 59:50.391
That can't be right. This is a cult murder.
What about the markings?

59:50.492 --> 59:53.362
What about the missing heart?

59:53.463 --> 59:56.853
All done to throw us off
if the body was ever found.

59:56.953 --> 01:00:00.447
He said he got the idea of switching bodies,
carving her up, cutting out her heart,

01:00:00.547 --> 01:00:02.280
from a local legend.

01:00:02.380 --> 01:00:04.518
He claims he did this alone?

01:00:04.618 --> 01:00:06.622
That's right.

01:00:06.722 --> 01:00:10.447
Well, what about Theresa Renney's X-Rays?

01:00:10.547 --> 01:00:12.601
Planted by Gair.

01:00:12.701 --> 01:00:15.463
When Renney found out, he panicked.

01:00:17.076 --> 01:00:19.465
Alison Gair is here.

01:00:19.565 --> 01:00:25.510
Right. Well, I hope this, uh...
gives you closure, Dr. Hamilton.

01:00:25.610 --> 01:00:30.191
And, uh, I'd appreciated you keeping
what I've told you between us for now.

01:00:32.206 --> 01:00:34.834
What happened to Melissa's baby?

01:00:35.647 --> 01:00:37.935
Gair faked an adoption.

01:00:38.035 --> 01:00:40.674
Does his current wife know?

01:00:40.774 --> 01:00:42.817
Not yet.

01:00:48.723 --> 01:00:50.562
Mrs. Gair.

01:01:01.264 --> 01:01:03.074
Hi.

01:01:04.922 --> 01:01:09.047
- What's all this?
- It's an apology.

01:01:09.147 --> 01:01:12.876
I heard about Stephen Gair.
I should have listened to you.

01:01:14.207 --> 01:01:16.077
Just...

01:01:16.277 --> 01:01:18.850
Answer me one thing.

01:01:18.950 --> 01:01:22.691
The other night, you weren't at work
you went to a meeting with the Rite.

01:01:22.791 --> 01:01:26.771
- You followed me?
- Just tell me why you lied.

01:01:27.968 --> 01:01:29.455
Well, it's supposed to be a surprise.

01:01:29.555 --> 01:01:33.150
Dad's organizing a big party for us
when we get the baby.

01:01:39.408 --> 01:01:42.168
Why? Wha... When did you...

01:03:00.252 --> 01:03:02.457
Why don't you hold him?

01:03:02.557 --> 01:03:04.962
- Me?
- Of course.

01:03:05.062 --> 01:03:07.116
Come here.

01:03:13.979 --> 01:03:15.516
When can we take him home?

01:03:15.616 --> 01:03:20.025
We monitor the babies for 9 days just to
make sure there's no medical complications.

01:03:20.125 --> 01:03:22.346
And to finalize all the paperwork.

01:03:22.447 --> 01:03:24.451
You, hello.

01:03:35.707 --> 01:03:37.783
Thank you.

01:03:38.128 --> 01:03:39.681
You're a natural.

01:03:47.046 --> 01:03:49.457
Great to see you again.

01:04:03.729 --> 01:04:05.850
Tora, you look absolutely lovely.

01:04:05.950 --> 01:04:09.424
Oh, thank you. What a beautiful party.

01:04:09.524 --> 01:04:11.795
Do you mind if I borrow
my son for a moment?

01:04:11.895 --> 01:04:14.133
Not at all.

01:04:25.540 --> 01:04:29.664
Lady of the hour standing alone.
Well, that won't do at all.

01:04:29.764 --> 01:04:33.623
- Ken, are you alone?
- No, I'm with my son, Hamish.

01:04:33.723 --> 01:04:37.747
Oh, he's very handsome.
Have any more hidden away?

01:04:37.847 --> 01:04:42.529
No, I think you'll find that, uh...
one Unst boy is quite enough.

01:04:45.863 --> 01:04:48.824
Oh, duty calls.

01:04:55.549 --> 01:04:57.158
- Steven.
- Hello.

01:04:57.258 --> 01:05:00.493
- Hi.
- Tora, may I introduce Mr. Grey?

01:05:00.593 --> 01:05:03.966
- Oh.
- Congratulations on your adoption.

01:05:04.066 --> 01:05:06.810
I'm sure you'll make a splendid mother.

01:05:12.583 --> 01:05:17.517
Right, well, I'll just go and see
if Elspeth needs a hand with anything.

01:08:56.564 --> 01:08:59.553
Excuse me, Elspeth,
have you seen Tora anywhere?

01:08:59.653 --> 01:09:00.627
No.

01:09:52.325 --> 01:09:54.880
Ah. Whoa! Hey, easy there, jumpy.

01:09:54.980 --> 01:09:57.658
Everybody's been wondering where you are.

01:10:05.148 --> 01:10:06.100
What?

01:10:06.200 --> 01:10:09.192
Where's my son?
Duncan, old son, where are you?

01:10:09.292 --> 01:10:12.055
Duncan, you're wanted.

01:10:27.144 --> 01:10:29.755
Duncan, the honor is yours.

01:10:47.385 --> 01:10:49.145
Tora!

01:11:10.130 --> 01:11:13.187
- Tora!
- Stay away from me.

01:11:13.888 --> 01:11:17.383
Where're you going?
You can't run from this.

01:11:17.746 --> 01:11:20.885
- You're one of them.
- I'm not, if you couldn't give me a son

01:11:20.985 --> 01:11:24.410
they were gonna kill you
to make room for someone who could.

01:11:24.510 --> 01:11:27.131
But we tried. We tried so hard.

01:11:27.231 --> 01:11:29.503
Even though you knew
what they would do to me!

01:11:29.603 --> 01:11:34.094
- I knew you'd never go to term.
- What? How could you know?

01:11:34.345 --> 01:11:37.858
How? How did you know?

01:11:42.361 --> 01:11:46.307
- What is this?
- It's an unapproved male contraceptive.

01:11:46.408 --> 01:11:49.733
- This is what you've been taking?
- Yeah.

01:11:51.045 --> 01:11:52.908
Are you even diabetic?

01:11:54.553 --> 01:11:56.732
Oh, my God.

01:11:56.832 --> 01:11:59.065
Oh, my God.

01:11:59.165 --> 01:12:02.434
All this time you let me think I was
the reason we couldn't have kids

01:12:02.534 --> 01:12:05.917
- when you... you were stopping us.
- I was protecting you.

01:12:06.017 --> 01:12:07.479
- Protecting me?
- Yeah.

01:12:07.579 --> 01:12:11.454
- You robbed me of my chance to be a mother!
- Do you think I don't know that?

01:12:11.554 --> 01:12:14.993
I had four miscarriages
'cause you were taking this shit!

01:12:15.093 --> 01:12:18.183
And if you hadn't, you'd have been
a mother for exactly nine days

01:12:18.283 --> 01:12:20.948
before they cut your fucking heart out!

01:12:22.709 --> 01:12:25.595
Is that what I should have let happen?

01:12:28.971 --> 01:12:30.942
Tora, wait!

01:12:31.042 --> 01:12:35.118
Don't you get it? I do nothing, you die.
I get you pregnant, you die.

01:12:35.218 --> 01:12:38.858
So I made a deal. We adopt one of them...

01:12:38.958 --> 01:12:41.929
- they let you live.
- And who's the mother?

01:12:42.029 --> 01:12:44.101
Grey's coming. I need
to tell him that you won't talk.

01:12:44.201 --> 01:12:45.930
- Who is she?
- Tora, please!

01:12:46.030 --> 01:12:48.265
Who is she?

01:12:50.598 --> 01:12:52.641
It's Dana.

01:12:55.566 --> 01:12:58.352
Dana's alive? She's next?

01:12:59.458 --> 01:13:01.700
There's nothing you can do.

01:13:08.366 --> 01:13:09.720
Tora!

01:13:10.721 --> 01:13:13.416
Wait! Don't! Tora!

01:13:14.378 --> 01:13:16.190
Tora!

01:13:22.896 --> 01:13:24.691
No!

01:13:24.791 --> 01:13:26.871
Nobody hurts her, that was the deal.

01:13:26.971 --> 01:13:30.985
You were only allowed to break tradition
if you could control her, you couldn't.

01:13:42.309 --> 01:13:45.466
If you weren't Richard's son,
I'd finish you right now.

01:13:45.566 --> 01:13:47.282
Nobody...

01:13:47.382 --> 01:13:49.248
hurts...

01:13:49.348 --> 01:13:52.402
my... wife!

01:14:37.645 --> 01:14:40.097
She's taken one of the boats.

01:15:37.105 --> 01:15:38.957
Dana?

01:15:43.844 --> 01:15:45.719
Dan...

01:15:57.370 --> 01:15:59.589
Talk to me.

01:16:00.845 --> 01:16:03.166
I have men searching the island for her.

01:16:03.266 --> 01:16:07.345
- I don't think she's in the building.
- I don't pay you to think.

01:16:52.505 --> 01:16:55.526
We'll just have to keep looking.
She must be here...

01:16:56.171 --> 01:16:59.157
- Duncan, what are you doing here?
- He's looking for his wife.

01:16:59.257 --> 01:17:03.614
No, no, no, no. I came to warn you.
I couldn't reason with her. She's here.

01:17:03.714 --> 01:17:05.812
I know.

01:17:24.754 --> 01:17:27.640
Sir, I think you'd better see this.

01:17:34.716 --> 01:17:38.630
She's found the ward. Go!

01:17:53.645 --> 01:17:57.451
Dana? Dana, wake up. Wake up!

01:18:04.525 --> 01:18:06.404
What is this shit?

01:18:06.504 --> 01:18:09.356
Dana, can you hear me?

01:18:10.036 --> 01:18:11.887
Dana?

01:18:45.974 --> 01:18:48.299
She's not down here.

01:18:48.680 --> 01:18:51.051
I'll wait here in case she doubles back.

01:18:51.151 --> 01:18:53.890
<i>I don't care who does what.</i>

01:18:53.990 --> 01:18:57.603
I just want the bitch found, okay?

01:18:57.948 --> 01:18:59.803
I'll deal with your wife,

01:18:59.903 --> 01:19:03.552
and when I'm done
maybe I'll take care of you.

01:19:11.158 --> 01:19:13.217
He's gone.

01:19:15.584 --> 01:19:18.924
- How did you know?
- I bought you that perfume, you remember?

01:19:19.024 --> 01:19:21.477
Wake her up. Go, go.

01:19:37.828 --> 01:19:39.688
It's okay.

01:19:46.161 --> 01:19:49.402
No, it's this way, to the lighthouse.
Come on.

01:19:49.502 --> 01:19:52.012
Okay. Come on.

01:19:52.608 --> 01:19:54.394
Wait.

01:19:54.695 --> 01:19:57.656
Please. My son.

01:19:58.603 --> 01:19:59.588
Please.

01:19:59.688 --> 01:20:01.926
- You go to the boat.
- No, I'll go.

01:20:02.026 --> 01:20:04.305
Would you even recognize him?
I'll be right behind you.

01:20:04.406 --> 01:20:06.668
Tora, no!

01:20:32.169 --> 01:20:34.013
Jesus!

01:20:35.527 --> 01:20:37.935
I'm sure it's just a false alarm.

01:20:51.776 --> 01:20:53.663
Oh.

01:20:53.963 --> 01:20:57.208
It's okay. It's okay.

01:20:59.207 --> 01:21:03.214
What are you doing?
Give him to me! Give him to me!

01:21:28.800 --> 01:21:31.067
You think you can turn your back on us?

01:21:35.989 --> 01:21:38.199
Where's Tora?

01:21:41.408 --> 01:21:44.838
- Where is she?
- Duncan!

01:21:47.904 --> 01:21:50.292
Dana, run!

01:21:50.392 --> 01:21:52.212
Run!

01:22:18.365 --> 01:22:20.369
You disgust me!

01:22:20.470 --> 01:22:23.397
You're a traitor to your clan!

01:22:27.867 --> 01:22:30.295
Come on. I've got you.

01:22:57.844 --> 01:23:01.833
If you're not one of us
you can die like one of them!

01:23:23.479 --> 01:23:26.657
Dana... come on.

01:23:27.904 --> 01:23:32.480
Alright, sweetheart. Sweetie,
I'm just gonna put you down for one second.

01:23:32.580 --> 01:23:34.835
There you go.

01:23:35.335 --> 01:23:39.745
Come on, Dana, get up! Come on, get up!

01:23:39.845 --> 01:23:42.074
Put her down.

01:23:49.280 --> 01:23:51.122
Ah!

01:23:53.539 --> 01:23:55.885
You've got guts, Tora.

01:23:55.985 --> 01:23:59.238
You would've been a strong Trow mother.

01:23:59.338 --> 01:24:01.705
Don't you touch that baby.

01:24:01.805 --> 01:24:06.155
It's the ninth day.
The ritual must be performed.

01:24:06.255 --> 01:24:09.972
The only question is...
will it be done by me?

01:24:10.873 --> 01:24:14.013
- Or you?
- Nobody has to do this.

01:24:14.414 --> 01:24:17.535
The first milk is done.
The colostrum is gone.

01:24:17.795 --> 01:24:22.184
Her body is of no more use
to the boy now than... formula.

01:24:22.396 --> 01:24:25.833
- She's his mother.
- No.

01:24:29.009 --> 01:24:31.097
You are.

01:24:31.197 --> 01:24:35.338
It's what you've always wanted.
It's what you've dreamed of.

01:24:35.439 --> 01:24:37.619
And here he is.

01:24:37.719 --> 01:24:42.156
And while other mothers only think
their children are special...

01:24:42.457 --> 01:24:44.846
yours truly will be.

01:24:45.893 --> 01:24:50.343
All you have to do...
is slip the knife into her...

01:24:50.444 --> 01:24:52.557
and you get to go home.

01:24:52.657 --> 01:24:54.968
You get to live your lives.

01:25:04.296 --> 01:25:06.590
What do I have to do?

01:25:06.860 --> 01:25:09.111
Kneel over her.

01:25:14.366 --> 01:25:16.938
You need to stab down hard...

01:25:17.038 --> 01:25:21.437
and slice the rib cage in a sawing motion.

01:25:22.416 --> 01:25:24.893
Do it for your son!

01:25:25.815 --> 01:25:29.047
And give thanks for the life
this glorious mother

01:25:29.147 --> 01:25:31.843
has given our newest son.

01:25:31.943 --> 01:25:36.249
So that our genetic supremacy
may continue.

01:25:43.007 --> 01:25:45.518
You think you can kill me?

01:25:48.852 --> 01:25:52.297
I'm not man, I'm Kunal Trow.

01:26:24.239 --> 01:26:27.730
And you... you could have been part of it.

01:26:30.769 --> 01:26:36.297
Instead, you'll be just like
the rest of your... miserable kind.

01:26:36.397 --> 01:26:38.198
Nothing!

01:27:04.504 --> 01:27:06.955
Tora!

01:27:30.556 --> 01:27:33.660
Oh, I'm sorry, I'm so sorry.

01:28:13.023 --> 01:28:14.861
- <i>D.I. McKie.</i>
- Go ahead.

01:28:14.961 --> 01:28:19.451
We've got another one. This one's
wearing a necklace that says Zoe.

01:28:21.006 --> 01:28:23.412
Joss Hawick's wife.

01:28:23.912 --> 01:28:26.250
How many's that?

01:28:26.851 --> 01:28:28.680
Too many.

01:28:29.448 --> 01:28:32.033
Can I ask you something?

01:28:33.063 --> 01:28:35.658
Did you know about all this?

01:28:39.494 --> 01:28:41.904
I have daughters.

01:28:47.233 --> 01:28:50.206
They were all somebody's daughter.
