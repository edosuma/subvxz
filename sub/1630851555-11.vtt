00:07.215 --> 00:09.718
A NETFLIX SERIES

00:09.801 --> 00:14.973
Putting a jigsaw puzzle together
requires strategy, a methodology,

00:15.765 --> 00:17.767
dominating the pieces,

00:17.851 --> 00:20.228
defeating them as if they were an enemy.

00:20.895 --> 00:23.773
THREE MONTHS LATER

00:25.108 --> 00:26.192
I said no, dude!

00:28.528 --> 00:29.946
Some pieces are difficult,

00:30.030 --> 00:32.741
but you love the challenge
of finding them.

00:32.824 --> 00:34.200
What, asshole?

00:34.951 --> 00:36.453
Fucking drunks!

00:38.663 --> 00:43.418
You're obsessed with some pieces
because you only see them from afar.

00:43.501 --> 00:45.795
-A rat!
-Where?

00:46.588 --> 00:50.091
-Call the cops.
-How do we convince them it was Pocho?

00:50.175 --> 00:52.260
You put a restraining order on him,

00:52.343 --> 00:55.597
and isn't that the wedding ring
you gave back to him?

00:55.680 --> 00:58.767
You know that's not enough
to have him arrested.

01:00.351 --> 01:01.561
Where's the cash?

01:03.146 --> 01:05.148
-In the drawer.
-Get it.

01:06.524 --> 01:08.443
Others are tricky.

01:09.569 --> 01:11.696
If you're not experienced enough.

01:18.119 --> 01:19.579
Take off your skirt.

01:29.255 --> 01:30.256
Relax.

01:30.965 --> 01:32.967
Others are not what they seem.

01:33.468 --> 01:35.095
That works in your favor.

01:35.762 --> 01:36.930
Or against you.

01:39.390 --> 01:40.225
Hop in.

01:40.308 --> 01:41.976
-Are you okay?
-Yes.

01:42.769 --> 01:44.604
López, ready to go in.

01:45.855 --> 01:47.023
Are you a nun?

01:47.107 --> 01:51.986
I was, now I work for the cops,
rescuing women like you.

01:56.074 --> 02:01.162
And finally, there are pieces
that hide all their secrets.

02:02.080 --> 02:04.249
Look, honey. For Rose.

02:10.797 --> 02:11.673
Valentina.

02:14.801 --> 02:15.635
Hi.

02:16.302 --> 02:19.013
Hi. I didn't know you were in Mexico.

02:19.097 --> 02:20.098
I got here today.

02:20.849 --> 02:22.475
Look, honey.

02:24.894 --> 02:26.396
Sorry. Hi.

02:29.816 --> 02:32.819
Meet Isabel, my girlfriend.

02:33.486 --> 02:34.904
And this is…

02:35.405 --> 02:36.489
Your sister.

02:37.157 --> 02:37.991
-Half.
-Half.

02:38.074 --> 02:39.409
On Dad's side.

02:39.492 --> 02:40.493
Nice to meet you.

02:41.035 --> 02:42.370
Nice to meet you.

02:42.453 --> 02:45.582
I like you a lot better now.
You've got great taste.

02:49.002 --> 02:51.754
-I need to go.
-Okay.

02:51.838 --> 02:53.548
-It was a pleasure.
-Same here.

02:56.050 --> 02:57.260
-Bye.
-Take care.

02:57.969 --> 02:59.304
-Bye.
-Bye.

03:00.972 --> 03:03.183
To me the real satisfaction…

03:04.434 --> 03:05.894
is the process.

03:08.021 --> 03:12.192
Knowing that with each piece you match,
you're closer to the goal.

03:12.275 --> 03:13.735
Completing the picture.

03:13.818 --> 03:16.279
And then destroying them.

03:16.863 --> 03:19.449
Like I will destroy those girls.

03:20.366 --> 03:24.662
Until they're forgotten in an old box
nobody's interested in.

03:26.706 --> 03:29.500
But first, we get them together.

03:35.089 --> 03:37.967
Good afternoon.
Mr. Marroquín is expecting you.

03:51.481 --> 03:53.066
Look, they have a jacuzzi.

03:53.149 --> 03:56.861
-Mr. Rogelio will be here soon.
-Excuse me. Does he live here?

03:58.279 --> 04:01.241
What do we call him? Grandpa?

04:01.324 --> 04:02.533
Yes.

04:02.617 --> 04:04.744
Why does he want to see us?

04:04.827 --> 04:08.623
To distribute Simón's estate.
What? We need the money.

04:08.706 --> 04:10.667
We can't accept it.

04:10.750 --> 04:13.878
We have every right to it,
although we're illegitimate.

04:14.420 --> 04:15.964
We made Simón commit suicide.

04:16.631 --> 04:19.342
Isn't it wrong to talk about his estate
with his dad?

04:19.425 --> 04:22.679
It was his guilty conscience
for using our mothers, not…

04:23.596 --> 04:24.639
Not what?

04:24.722 --> 04:26.808
She's having a vision.

04:41.197 --> 04:44.575
Tell Víctor to wait in the car.
They can't see him.

04:45.326 --> 04:46.160
Right away.

04:48.121 --> 04:49.956
-What did you see?
-Death.

04:52.875 --> 04:54.085
The Tarot card.

04:55.003 --> 04:56.379
What does it mean?

04:56.462 --> 05:00.216
I'm so glad you accepted my invitation.

05:00.758 --> 05:02.927
We need to get to know each other.

05:04.679 --> 05:05.805
Valentina.

05:05.888 --> 05:07.140
Bautista?

05:08.975 --> 05:10.101
Caridad.

05:10.601 --> 05:11.769
Manny.

05:12.645 --> 05:13.771
Matilde.

05:15.273 --> 05:17.400
Welcome. Was I right?

05:18.318 --> 05:19.152
Thank you.

05:19.652 --> 05:22.572
Are any of you good at archery?

05:24.741 --> 05:27.869
We begin with 501 points,

05:28.536 --> 05:29.954
we subtract points,

05:30.538 --> 05:33.333
and the goal is getting to zero.

05:35.293 --> 05:36.377
You.

05:40.173 --> 05:41.007
Like it?

05:42.091 --> 05:44.469
I had it made by an artist from Catemaco.

05:45.636 --> 05:49.474
-It's just like…
-The birthmark you got from Simón.

05:50.391 --> 05:52.727
Which he got from me,
and I got from my mother.

05:53.269 --> 05:55.605
It's a very special symbol.

05:55.688 --> 05:58.941
How do you know my sisters and I
have that birthmark?

05:59.025 --> 06:00.234
Simón told me.

06:00.902 --> 06:05.031
He also told me how you were conceived.

06:07.075 --> 06:11.454
But I didn't ask you over
to talk about any sad issues.

06:13.039 --> 06:16.376
You did it to teach us
how to use a bow and arrow?

06:30.098 --> 06:31.516
I don't need any lessons.

06:32.975 --> 06:34.352
I like playing games.

06:35.645 --> 06:38.398
But I asked you over
to give you a present.

06:52.036 --> 06:53.371
-Hi.
-Hi.

06:54.122 --> 06:55.665
How can I help you?

06:55.748 --> 06:57.792
You are Camilo.

06:58.793 --> 06:59.627
Yes.

06:59.710 --> 07:01.254
Hi. I'm Isabel.

07:02.463 --> 07:04.090
-Right.
-Cárdenas.

07:05.883 --> 07:08.344
The company's PR specialist.

07:10.263 --> 07:12.306
-This company's?
-Yes.

07:13.182 --> 07:14.016
Camilo.

07:14.725 --> 07:18.729
Why didn't you call me?
I would've picked you up at the airport.

07:18.813 --> 07:23.234
There was no need for that.
It was a surprise.

07:23.317 --> 07:26.320
-Okay.
-Thanks for running it for three months.

07:26.404 --> 07:29.115
It's not like you were vacationing.

07:29.198 --> 07:31.033
And now you're back for good.

07:31.117 --> 07:32.827
You need to put up with me.

07:32.910 --> 07:38.749
Why didn't you tell me
about our new PR specialist?

07:38.833 --> 07:40.543
-And…
-Girlfriend.

07:41.085 --> 07:42.920
I told you about her. Remember?

07:43.004 --> 07:47.258
Right. I'm such a moron.
You're twice as welcome.

07:47.341 --> 07:48.885
-Thanks.
-How about a tour?

07:48.968 --> 07:52.013
-I'd love it.
-Great. Follow me.

07:53.055 --> 07:54.348
Let's see.

07:54.432 --> 07:57.643
This is where we store the casks,

07:57.727 --> 07:59.896
and we process the beer here.

08:00.688 --> 08:03.691
WOMAN OF COURAGE CRAFT BEER

08:05.735 --> 08:08.529
Meet Isabel, my girlfriend.

08:09.780 --> 08:13.117
Wow! This place is awesome!

08:13.201 --> 08:16.245
Five rooms, a Jacuzzi, a gym.
It's got everything!

08:17.121 --> 08:20.416
Nobody's lived here in ages.
The energy is too light.

08:21.000 --> 08:22.168
Unbelievable!

08:22.877 --> 08:25.588
One room is like
two of the convent's rooms.

08:25.671 --> 08:27.548
Or three or four.

08:27.632 --> 08:30.718
If he really gives us the house
and $5,000…

08:30.801 --> 08:32.512
I'll sign whatever the old man says.

08:33.054 --> 08:36.140
We need to take our time
and meditate on it.

08:37.308 --> 08:38.643
I'll be right there.

08:42.146 --> 08:43.397
Do you like the house?

08:45.399 --> 08:49.153
You can move in tomorrow if you want.

08:49.737 --> 08:50.905
What's the catch?

08:53.407 --> 08:55.660
No one can ever know the truth.

08:56.494 --> 09:00.623
Nobody would benefit from knowing
what Simón did to your moms.

09:01.541 --> 09:04.085
Or the lengths he went to, to do it.

09:06.420 --> 09:08.548
I'm just protecting the family.

09:10.466 --> 09:12.718
Which now includes you guys, of course.

09:13.219 --> 09:16.264
My sisters and I only wanted justice.

09:16.347 --> 09:20.142
And you got it. Simón paid with his life
for the pain he caused.

09:20.226 --> 09:21.852
Thanks, but I want nothing.

09:23.145 --> 09:25.648
I didn't even want to meet my dad.

09:26.607 --> 09:29.026
We just keep quiet and the house is ours?

09:29.527 --> 09:32.321
Yes, but only if all of you accept it.

09:35.658 --> 09:38.953
The place is yours
for the rest of the day.

09:39.036 --> 09:41.330
Enjoy it, and think about it.

09:42.456 --> 09:44.542
But whatever you decide,

09:45.960 --> 09:51.674
thank you so much for this afternoon,
which I hope is just the first of many.

09:53.968 --> 09:55.261
Thanks, Grandpa.

09:56.846 --> 09:57.805
Grandpa?

10:06.439 --> 10:07.940
Did they accept it, Boss?

10:08.024 --> 10:12.320
Three of them still need to be convinced
living here is their only option.

10:17.074 --> 10:20.119
We'll never have a chance like this
in our lives.

10:20.828 --> 10:22.121
I don't need a house.

10:22.204 --> 10:24.874
You can never have too many houses,
Valentina.

10:25.666 --> 10:27.835
It's our chance to live together.

10:28.502 --> 10:33.299
And it's big enough to avoid each other
for two weeks if we want.

10:33.883 --> 10:35.468
I say yes!

10:36.761 --> 10:38.554
I need to ask my dad.

10:39.805 --> 10:40.890
What do you think?

10:40.973 --> 10:42.975
Only if everybody says yes.

10:43.059 --> 10:48.272
I want nothing from the  Marroquíns.
I'll ask Rogelio to let you guys move in.

10:48.773 --> 10:52.818
The guy is impenetrable.
I can't even read his aura. He'll say no.

10:52.902 --> 10:54.820
My answer is still no.

10:54.904 --> 10:55.988
Pride or fear?

10:56.739 --> 11:01.410
Because you still want Federico.
And you'll screw us over.

11:01.494 --> 11:02.953
Manny, shut up.

11:05.665 --> 11:06.999
What are you doing?

11:07.083 --> 11:10.002
I want to know what it feels like
to have a sibling touch my boobs.

11:13.172 --> 11:14.006
Gross.

11:21.889 --> 11:24.558
No, Manny! My hair!

11:29.146 --> 11:30.648
I'll be very brief.

11:31.941 --> 11:33.150
When we met,

11:33.234 --> 11:36.737
you wanted a new logo
and brand name, remember?

11:38.030 --> 11:39.865
I don't see why. They're okay.

11:40.866 --> 11:45.788
I had other ideas,
but we were already marketing it,

11:45.871 --> 11:48.708
so it wasn't profitable, that's why.

11:49.750 --> 11:50.751
Wasn't it her?

11:53.462 --> 11:55.881
The woman who broke your heart?

12:01.011 --> 12:02.054
Yes, it was her.

12:04.515 --> 12:06.892
I immortalized my ex in my logo.

12:09.645 --> 12:10.855
I'm kidding!

12:14.817 --> 12:15.651
Okay.

12:16.902 --> 12:19.155
So why was it an impossible love?

12:19.947 --> 12:21.574
Was she married?

12:21.657 --> 12:22.533
No.

12:23.033 --> 12:26.078
Lesbian? Alien?

12:27.705 --> 12:32.042
I need to know
what kind of ghost I'm fighting.

12:32.543 --> 12:35.755
You're fighting against
your own fantasies.

12:53.564 --> 12:55.900
Do you believe in fighting fire with fire?

12:56.400 --> 12:58.652
Because Federico sure took the advice.

12:59.278 --> 13:03.365
It hardly ever works,
and it could get even worse.

13:03.449 --> 13:05.201
It's the voice of experience.

13:06.702 --> 13:09.371
I thought you dumped Tomás.

13:09.455 --> 13:12.458
It was a mutual decision
and I didn't mean Tomás.

13:12.541 --> 13:13.959
Who then?

13:15.920 --> 13:17.588
No one that matters anymore.

13:22.009 --> 13:24.970
The only way to get someone
out of your heart

13:25.638 --> 13:26.806
is with your head.

13:29.558 --> 13:33.145
I'd have to learn to see Federico
as my brother, but…

13:35.022 --> 13:37.691
my memories of him
are anything but brotherly.

13:39.902 --> 13:41.987
I can't accept the house, Bautista.

13:43.197 --> 13:46.158
Last thing I need now
is to be near him and his family.

13:51.080 --> 13:52.498
You're saying no, right?

13:53.833 --> 13:56.335
Marroquín can't make you keep quiet.

13:58.420 --> 14:00.798
But nobody wants to report Simón anymore.

14:01.924 --> 14:04.301
He's dead. What good would it do?

14:05.261 --> 14:10.224
People will want to know all the details
of how he took advantage of your moms.

14:11.350 --> 14:15.563
Mine is so vulnerable,
it could even be traumatic for her.

14:17.314 --> 14:21.068
I think moving to the house with me
would do her a lot of good.

14:21.735 --> 14:24.780
And anyway,
we can't stay at the convent forever.

14:27.157 --> 14:28.367
You're right about that.

14:31.871 --> 14:33.122
We need names.

14:34.164 --> 14:36.542
Make the girl tell you
now that she's okay.

14:37.251 --> 14:39.336
INTERROGATION ROOM

14:39.420 --> 14:43.549
She's scared he'll find her
like so many other times.

14:50.180 --> 14:52.600
See why people like Julia
are so important?

14:54.518 --> 14:57.813
-You said you'd never go back there.
-And I kept my word.

14:58.939 --> 15:03.444
But since the cops can't promise anything

15:04.695 --> 15:06.030
they've no other choice

15:06.864 --> 15:09.700
but to forge papers
and start living a new life.

15:12.703 --> 15:13.537
Okay?

15:17.958 --> 15:18.792
Good luck.

15:21.295 --> 15:23.213
Hi. How are you?

15:24.006 --> 15:26.759
This is half of my rent, Julia, sorry.

15:27.927 --> 15:31.597
With the robbery
and my Instagram account hacked…

15:31.680 --> 15:35.017
Wow, sis. You need a cleansing.

15:35.100 --> 15:38.312
Been three times already.
Somebody's targeting you.

15:42.983 --> 15:44.485
You're lucky.

15:45.235 --> 15:48.489
She came from Catemaco yesterday
for a few days.

15:52.326 --> 15:54.078
Hi, Serrana.

15:56.372 --> 15:59.625
La Serrana, a lifelong friend of mine.

16:00.793 --> 16:03.879
My dear friend here
says you need a reading.

16:04.588 --> 16:07.341
I don't use black magic.

16:07.424 --> 16:08.258
Me neither.

16:09.635 --> 16:11.136
That's why I need your help.

16:12.388 --> 16:14.431
I need to know if a ring has a spell.

16:14.515 --> 16:18.394
It's from Catemaco
with a family birthmark.

16:19.103 --> 16:23.315
If you have a photograph or drawing,
I can ask around in my town.

16:28.696 --> 16:31.657
A guy who's trying to get close
to my sisters and me has it.

16:32.157 --> 16:34.785
I need to know if we're in any danger.

16:36.912 --> 16:40.749
I'm in as much danger at your place
as the new house.

16:40.833 --> 16:44.962
And I can't stay with you and Claudio
forever, Dad.

16:46.296 --> 16:47.131
Why not?

16:48.507 --> 16:52.803
Because I need my space.
And I won't be alone.

16:55.347 --> 16:57.016
You worry too much.

16:57.516 --> 16:58.726
Come here.

17:00.644 --> 17:02.021
I still can't believe it.

17:02.521 --> 17:05.858
Bumping into each other
without knowing he was your dad?

17:05.941 --> 17:07.860
That's better than a soap.

17:07.943 --> 17:12.823
Bea, I'm a little hot.
Can I have a dark beer please?

17:12.906 --> 17:15.159
-Can I get you something?
-No, thanks.

17:19.621 --> 17:21.623
When will you tell her the truth?

17:22.124 --> 17:27.129
You're the only person I wanted to know
all about my sex change.

17:30.257 --> 17:32.176
My mom told me she received

17:32.259 --> 17:37.514
Dominga Heredia's
Colombian death certificate.

17:38.015 --> 17:39.933
That's great!

17:40.017 --> 17:43.854
I am finally totally free.

17:46.607 --> 17:47.441
Hey.

17:48.567 --> 17:49.735
Stay with me.

17:51.570 --> 17:53.530
Don't move to that house.

18:02.915 --> 18:06.460
I'm just saying
I'm not sure it's a good idea.

18:06.960 --> 18:10.506
Fede told me Rogelio's a sly fox.

18:10.589 --> 18:12.841
I've dealt with sly foxes all my life.

18:13.801 --> 18:15.469
I could use the money and the house.

18:15.552 --> 18:20.099
Since I can't work in clubs,
I've had to do bachelor parties.

18:20.182 --> 18:22.976
You could get another job.

18:26.939 --> 18:28.232
Wait.

18:31.443 --> 18:32.277
I've tried.

18:33.445 --> 18:35.948
You know I can't find a job.

18:36.031 --> 18:39.743
I can't because I've always worked
as a table dancer.

18:39.827 --> 18:40.702
Look, Manny.

18:41.328 --> 18:44.915
You can't expect your boyfriend
to like you being a stripper.

18:44.998 --> 18:47.126
We're fuck buddies, Camilo!

18:48.377 --> 18:49.378
That's it.

18:51.296 --> 18:52.131
Right.

19:04.184 --> 19:06.145
And stripping has its advantages.

19:10.023 --> 19:10.858
I don't know.

19:13.986 --> 19:14.945
Private shows.

19:17.906 --> 19:19.074
If you behave.

19:29.585 --> 19:31.253
The right to touch me.

19:40.262 --> 19:42.598
Not another word about my job.

19:48.604 --> 19:52.357
The room is huge
compared to the one we have here.

19:53.942 --> 19:55.944
And we could use the money.

19:57.529 --> 20:00.782
What the precinct pays me
isn't enough for something decent.

20:01.617 --> 20:03.827
And your therapy, imagine.

20:04.745 --> 20:06.830
I'm not complaining.

20:07.998 --> 20:11.293
You know your well-being
is all that matters to me.

20:12.586 --> 20:15.005
All right, child.

20:17.591 --> 20:21.428
You really don't remember
Rogelio Marroquín?

20:23.639 --> 20:28.435
No, that part of my life
and my relationship with your dad

20:28.518 --> 20:30.938
are lost in my mind.

20:35.525 --> 20:37.402
Maybe it's better to forget.

20:43.283 --> 20:44.117
What's this?

20:44.910 --> 20:46.703
They slipped it under the door.

20:52.793 --> 20:54.503
TERMINATION OF LEASE AGREEMENT

20:54.586 --> 20:59.466
What's wrong with this dumb landlord?
He wants us out of here in a week.

21:01.635 --> 21:02.636
What's going on?

21:03.845 --> 21:08.016
Salvador did paycuts at the magazine
and now we don't have a home.

21:08.100 --> 21:10.018
And I have no clients or savings

21:10.602 --> 21:13.438
precisely when we're offered
a house for free?

21:20.070 --> 21:23.282
Rogelio is not the kind of man
you really get to know.

21:23.782 --> 21:25.784
Tell Manny not to be surprised

21:25.867 --> 21:29.579
if he asks them to sign an agreement
like he asked me.

21:30.247 --> 21:31.290
How is Fede?

21:32.749 --> 21:35.127
Traveling was good for him.
Hasn't he called?

21:37.296 --> 21:39.214
Manny says to forget about working,

21:39.298 --> 21:41.800
Fede made the offer
before finding out and…

21:42.467 --> 21:47.431
Susana, you were Simón's victim too,
and we all deserve a chance.

21:47.514 --> 21:50.642
-Like me with this coat, how do I look?
-Fabulous.

21:50.726 --> 21:55.314
One day you told me
you had married the wrong guy.

21:56.398 --> 21:59.359
Was there or is there anyone else?

22:00.569 --> 22:03.613
How many tequilas did I have
when I said that?

22:03.697 --> 22:08.327
-A lot.
-Exactly. And this coat suits you better.

22:08.410 --> 22:09.244
You think so?

22:11.621 --> 22:12.456
Done.

22:14.875 --> 22:16.084
Is that all?

22:18.045 --> 22:18.879
Yes.

22:20.714 --> 22:23.300
You're out of the trust as you requested.

22:25.052 --> 22:26.011
Ignacio.

22:28.180 --> 22:31.433
You're the only son I have left.
We're good, right?

22:32.309 --> 22:34.394
I'd have to trust you, Dad.

22:34.978 --> 22:36.313
Let me guess.

22:36.396 --> 22:38.357
Apart from your mother's death,

22:39.441 --> 22:42.444
you think I'm involved
in your brother's death.

22:42.527 --> 22:45.197
You said it, not me.

22:47.324 --> 22:50.410
Simón was 12 when your mother
committed suicide.

22:50.994 --> 22:52.579
That devastated him.

22:52.662 --> 22:55.749
That's why he wanted to die the same way.

22:56.666 --> 22:58.668
Any shrink can explain it to you.

22:59.294 --> 23:00.253
Yes, I guess so.

23:01.171 --> 23:04.633
But I'd rather ask a coroner.

23:05.550 --> 23:08.095
I'm having my brother's body exhumed.

23:12.349 --> 23:13.975
Have a nice day, Dad.

23:15.018 --> 23:15.852
You too.

23:17.771 --> 23:21.066
This is The Woman of Courage pale ale.

23:22.818 --> 23:23.735
For the brave?

23:23.819 --> 23:27.072
Right, this is the porter,
the IPA, the Pilsner,

23:27.155 --> 23:31.201
and we're developing a pale lager,
but the taste needs to improve.

23:32.119 --> 23:35.038
-It's delicious!
-Really?

23:35.122 --> 23:36.623
-Amazing.
-Really?

23:36.706 --> 23:40.627
Sure, you'll be a huge success.
When's the opening?

23:40.710 --> 23:43.004
-Well…
-Next week.

23:44.339 --> 23:45.882
I hope you can make it.

23:46.800 --> 23:48.301
You came for the opening.

23:48.802 --> 23:50.262
I haven't told you, Mom.

23:50.846 --> 23:53.223
He moved to Mexico
to focus on the business.

23:55.392 --> 23:57.644
It's never too late
to start all over again.

24:05.360 --> 24:09.322
The place looks great
and I know you'll do very well.

24:09.406 --> 24:12.909
Good luck to the three of you
from the bottom of my heart.

24:13.577 --> 24:17.664
Thanks, Camilo. I need to go.
Don't forget to call your aunt.

24:18.248 --> 24:19.124
Excuse me.

24:22.669 --> 24:26.173
What was that? Did you fight or something?

24:27.883 --> 24:28.800
No.

24:29.843 --> 24:31.595
But after three months,

24:33.013 --> 24:34.681
it looks like I'm not welcome.

25:10.592 --> 25:12.427
I'm not saying it's a bad omen.

25:12.511 --> 25:14.721
All I'm saying is I don't like it.

25:14.804 --> 25:16.640
But what does it mean?

25:18.183 --> 25:21.061
The High Priestess is someone powerful.

25:21.728 --> 25:22.771
Rogelio?

25:24.814 --> 25:27.400
Seven of Wands, a battle.

25:27.484 --> 25:30.070
And The Hanged Man, oppressive separation.

25:31.238 --> 25:35.909
I don't get any of this.
They're just cards to me.

25:37.077 --> 25:38.620
Is Valentina accepting?

25:39.621 --> 25:44.251
It looks like we have no choice.
And I don't like that either.

25:44.918 --> 25:46.461
Did you talk to Daniel?

25:47.212 --> 25:49.381
Yes, but he insists.

25:49.464 --> 25:52.842
And I don't want to hurt him
after all he's been through.

25:54.594 --> 25:57.722
Mati, your dad says to go home.

26:01.851 --> 26:05.188
What kind of sicko
does this to an innocent dog?

26:05.855 --> 26:08.316
It had to be while we were at the market.

26:08.400 --> 26:11.403
Aren't there any cameras
to see who did it?

26:11.486 --> 26:12.779
It was clearly Pocho.

26:13.697 --> 26:17.909
The rat in the sink and this
are messages from a sick guy.

26:17.993 --> 26:20.537
He thinks killing animals
will make me go back?

26:20.620 --> 26:22.497
I'm calling the cops.

26:23.081 --> 26:25.667
Honey, you need to move.

26:27.627 --> 26:29.629
He might come for you next time,

26:31.006 --> 26:32.507
and I don't want him to find you.

26:33.508 --> 26:35.468
Accept Marroquín's house.

26:44.311 --> 26:46.688
Carefully, please. Over here.

26:51.943 --> 26:53.028
Thank you.

27:08.251 --> 27:09.794
She's always with you.

27:12.297 --> 27:15.091
I kind of feel lonely all of a sudden.

27:15.884 --> 27:16.718
Lonely?

27:17.886 --> 27:20.513
You're moving in with your four sisters.

27:27.020 --> 27:29.439
How are you, Alice?

27:30.607 --> 27:32.901
Improving. Thank you.

27:32.984 --> 27:33.985
You look good.

27:34.694 --> 27:38.823
Are you moving here with Manny?

27:38.907 --> 27:42.702
No, I don't think my daughter
will like the idea.

27:43.244 --> 27:46.665
Three months living together
were more than enough for her.

27:48.083 --> 27:49.000
You?

27:49.501 --> 27:52.253
Yes, but in a few weeks.

27:52.754 --> 27:56.841
I need to get accustomed
to the idea slowly.

27:57.592 --> 27:58.426
Mom.

27:59.552 --> 28:00.387
Hi.

28:19.948 --> 28:23.284
Get out, stay away from my daughter!

28:23.368 --> 28:26.121
I just want to check the water heater.

28:26.204 --> 28:27.997
-Get out!
-Susana.

28:29.082 --> 28:31.000
He tried to kill my daughter!

28:31.084 --> 28:35.547
Yes, but carrying out Simón's orders
when he kidnapped her.

28:36.339 --> 28:37.757
And he's very remorseful.

28:39.217 --> 28:41.720
He's just another victim
of my son's machinations.

28:42.887 --> 28:45.140
You of all people must know that.

28:46.349 --> 28:49.769
Víctor will have no contact
with the girls.

28:50.437 --> 28:54.566
I promise he'll only come over
to do odd-jobs.

29:05.493 --> 29:08.288
Rogelio Marroquín
knows nothing about me, right?

29:08.371 --> 29:10.039
-No.
-You're sure?

29:10.123 --> 29:12.876
No. Your secret is safe.

29:20.300 --> 29:21.134
Come here.

29:28.349 --> 29:31.311
Come downstairs.
He wants to speak with us.

29:31.394 --> 29:32.812
-Come.
-I don't want to.

29:33.521 --> 29:35.064
-Behave.
-No…

29:35.148 --> 29:38.276
I bought this house ten years ago,

29:40.320 --> 29:44.824
thinking it would be
a kind of retirement insurance.

29:46.284 --> 29:48.453
Not that it would be for five girls

29:49.621 --> 29:53.333
who a few months ago,
I didn't even know existed.

29:54.584 --> 29:58.421
And I'm extremely lucky
to have you in my life.

29:59.589 --> 30:04.052
I can finally offer you
everything you deserve.

30:05.887 --> 30:08.348
Alice and Susana,

30:09.641 --> 30:11.559
as I told your daughters…

30:13.144 --> 30:15.313
Count on me for anything.

30:16.022 --> 30:17.190
You too, Daniel.

30:18.024 --> 30:22.904
I know Matilde is like a daughter to you,
so that goes for you too.

30:26.074 --> 30:26.908
Bye.

30:28.076 --> 30:29.786
But first…

30:31.746 --> 30:33.039
here in the library…

30:34.499 --> 30:37.752
there's a jigsaw puzzle.

30:38.253 --> 30:43.967
It's not complete, but the missing pieces
are hidden all over the house.

30:44.592 --> 30:45.927
Is this Big Brother?

30:47.136 --> 30:48.221
We must find them?

30:48.304 --> 30:52.308
Only if you want to.
I said I liked playing games, right?

30:52.976 --> 30:57.063
If you find them,
you'll get an even nicer present.

31:05.780 --> 31:07.073
Mr. Marroquín.

31:09.075 --> 31:10.493
Thank you for everything.

31:11.494 --> 31:13.121
You are very generous.

31:13.204 --> 31:15.582
Call me Rogelio. We're family, right?

31:17.041 --> 31:22.297
Caridad says your doctor's office
wasn't near the house.

31:23.131 --> 31:24.007
No.

31:26.676 --> 31:27.969
Here's my card.

31:31.222 --> 31:34.851
If you want, after you move,
we'll find another doctor.

31:36.102 --> 31:37.687
Call me anytime.

31:52.535 --> 31:53.661
Mom.

31:57.498 --> 31:58.791
Everything okay, Mom?

32:00.668 --> 32:01.794
Yes.

32:03.004 --> 32:04.797
Marroquín is a very weird guy.

32:05.924 --> 32:08.718
I've never put a jigsaw puzzle together.

32:09.427 --> 32:12.096
There's nothing bad about it. I'm excited.

32:12.180 --> 32:14.682
We'll be spending our time
looking for the pieces.

32:15.391 --> 32:16.309
That's ridiculous.

32:16.392 --> 32:19.020
I don't think it's about looking for them.

32:20.480 --> 32:22.065
But finding them.

32:26.402 --> 32:27.946
Isn't it the same thing?

32:32.200 --> 32:34.202
I found one!

32:35.453 --> 32:37.538
I wonder what the prize is! How exciting!

32:37.622 --> 32:42.126
I'm excited too,
but accepting more gifts is impolite.

32:42.210 --> 32:45.880
Caridad! Will you ever stop being a nun?

32:48.299 --> 32:51.135
Come, Manny. We need to talk.

32:51.803 --> 32:53.763
-We've had enough of you.
-Wait.

32:54.681 --> 32:57.141
Games are clearly the guy's passion.

32:57.725 --> 32:59.727
It's not passion or family pride.

33:00.728 --> 33:02.647
It's more than just a game.

33:14.033 --> 33:15.994
Anyone ever told you
how beautiful you are?
