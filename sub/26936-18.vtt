00:01.050 --> 00:02.770
NARRATOR: Tonight,
on The Curse of Oak Island...

00:03.270 --> 00:06.139
RICK: These items came
from the tunnel

00:06.139 --> 00:07.140
associated with the Money Pit.

00:07.140 --> 00:08.460
MARTY:
We might be closing in.

00:08.460 --> 00:10.450
Human beings were down there.

00:10.450 --> 00:11.850
This is the kind of thing
you were hoping for.

00:11.850 --> 00:13.269
Oh, really?
I would put it

00:13.269 --> 00:14.740
in the early 1700s.

00:14.740 --> 00:16.510
GARY:
Look at that.

00:16.510 --> 00:18.279
Fits like a glove!

00:18.279 --> 00:19.990
Know what this reminds me of?

00:19.990 --> 00:21.760
What?
The hole in the cross!

00:21.760 --> 00:24.359
TOBIAS:
The lead isotope data here

00:24.359 --> 00:27.810
is identical to the cross.

00:27.810 --> 00:30.169
Excellent.
MARTY: Wow.

00:30.169 --> 00:32.940
NARRATOR:
There is an island

00:32.940 --> 00:35.219
in the North Atlantic

00:35.219 --> 00:42.020
where people have been looking
for an incredible treasure

00:42.020 --> 00:43.020
for more than 200 years.

00:43.020 --> 00:44.809
So far, they have found
a stone slab

00:44.809 --> 00:47.500
with strange symbols carved
into it,

00:47.500 --> 00:50.750
mysterious fragments
of human bone,

00:50.750 --> 00:54.480
and a lead cross whose origin
may stretch back

00:54.480 --> 00:57.230
to the days
of the Knights Templar.

00:57.230 --> 01:01.339
To date, six men have died
trying to solve the mystery.

01:01.339 --> 01:03.339
And, according to legend,

01:03.339 --> 01:06.330
one more will have to die

01:06.330 --> 01:11.240
before the treasure
can be found.

01:19.540 --> 01:26.040
NARRATOR: As a new day begins
on Oak Island...

01:26.040 --> 01:28.600
Let's get Craig on the TV
and talk about this.

01:28.600 --> 01:31.670
...brothers Rick and Marty
Lagina are in the war room

01:31.670 --> 01:33.340
to conduct an important meeting

01:33.340 --> 01:36.630
via video conference with
their partner Craig Tester.

01:36.630 --> 01:39.430
Hello, Craig.
Hey, Craig.

01:39.430 --> 01:40.840
Hey, guys.

01:40.840 --> 01:41.840
We're here to discuss

01:41.840 --> 01:43.980
Smith's Cove.
Sounds good.

01:43.980 --> 01:46.490
For me,
as close as we're getting

01:46.490 --> 01:50.030
to the end of the year here, we
really got to do this excavation

01:50.030 --> 01:52.010
and dig underneath
the crane pad.

01:52.010 --> 01:53.010
Yep.

01:53.010 --> 01:55.170
We did get an extension
on the cofferdam.

01:55.170 --> 01:56.770
MARTY:
And our permits.

01:56.770 --> 01:57.970
Oh, no kidding?

01:57.970 --> 02:00.090
But we need to make a decision,

02:00.090 --> 02:02.110
because time and weather's
closing in.

02:02.110 --> 02:06.270
You know,
Marty's well aware that

02:06.270 --> 02:08.949
and you are, too
of the red dye results

02:08.949 --> 02:10.970
coming out in Smith's Cove.

02:10.970 --> 02:13.160
NARRATOR:
Three weeks ago...

02:13.160 --> 02:15.680
Let's do this.
The Oak Island team

02:15.680 --> 02:18.980
conducted a largescale test
at the Money Pit site

02:18.980 --> 02:21.670
by pumping thousands
of gallons of water,

02:21.670 --> 02:23.950
mixed with nontoxic red dye,

02:23.950 --> 02:26.590
down the exploratory
borehole C1.

02:26.590 --> 02:28.404
MARTY (over radio):
The dye has been cast.

02:28.404 --> 02:29.504
Copy that.

02:29.504 --> 02:31.104
NARRATOR:
They were attempting to locate

02:31.204 --> 02:33.580
where a number of believed
flood tunnels originate

02:33.680 --> 02:35.850
off the island's shores,

02:36.250 --> 02:38.069
flood tunnels
which were designed

02:38.069 --> 02:39.640
as a means of boobytrapping

02:39.640 --> 02:43.060
the centuriesold
treasure shaft.

02:43.060 --> 02:44.220
Just hours after beginning

02:44.220 --> 02:47.340
their operation,
treasure hunter Gary Drayton

02:47.340 --> 02:48.760
was astonished to discover

02:48.760 --> 02:51.510
redcolored water
seeping out from the ground

02:51.510 --> 02:54.630
at Smith's Cove,

02:54.630 --> 02:56.630
water which
then tested positive

02:56.630 --> 02:58.680
for traces of the red dye...

02:58.680 --> 03:00.250
That's a good
positive indication.

03:00.250 --> 03:01.730
...meaning that the team

03:01.730 --> 03:04.040
may have finally located
a flood tunnel

03:04.040 --> 03:05.990
connected directly
to the location

03:05.990 --> 03:08.400
of the fabled
Oak Island treasure vault.

03:08.400 --> 03:10.810
Yeah! It's even higher!

03:10.810 --> 03:14.250
I have to say, the dye
only coming out in Smith's Cove,

03:14.250 --> 03:17.850
do you find that persuasive
like I kind of do?

03:17.850 --> 03:20.400
Yeah, I do.
I mean, especially, you know,

03:20.400 --> 03:23.870
where... where historically
we think the, um,

03:23.870 --> 03:25.190
flood system is,

03:25.190 --> 03:27.990
that there's still water
seeping around the edges.

03:27.990 --> 03:31.150
So, you know, I think
we have to follow it, for sure.

03:31.150 --> 03:33.670
I do, too. I mean,
if we actually unearthed

03:33.670 --> 03:35.970
the flood tunnel,
that would change a lot.

03:35.970 --> 03:38.750
I think we all agree that
it should be followed up on.

03:38.750 --> 03:39.810
It's just, how?

03:39.810 --> 03:42.650
You know,
with the fall storms coming in,

03:42.650 --> 03:45.770
I think the sooner the better
that Billy gets out there.

03:45.770 --> 03:48.290
I'd call him
and start tomorrow. Say, "Okay,

03:48.290 --> 03:51.490
start taking the crane pad apart
and follow it back."

03:51.490 --> 03:52.650
Yep.
Yeah.

03:52.650 --> 03:55.709
NARRATOR: Having just obtained
government permission

03:55.709 --> 03:59.239
to leave the 525footlong
steel cofferdam

03:59.239 --> 04:01.709
surrounding Smith's Cove
in place,

04:01.709 --> 04:04.770
the Laginas and their partners
will now dismantle

04:04.770 --> 04:07.790
the 6,000 squarefoot
wooden construction pad

04:07.790 --> 04:09.709
so that they can dig
beneath the area

04:09.709 --> 04:11.599
and hopefully uncover
what could be

04:11.599 --> 04:14.930
the convergence point
for the flood tunnels.

04:14.930 --> 04:18.600
What's becoming clear is to do
a complete job in Smith's Cove,

04:18.600 --> 04:20.819
we're gonna have
to move the crane pad.

04:20.819 --> 04:22.740
And we are absolutely
running out of time.

04:22.740 --> 04:23.949
The weather's closing in.

04:23.949 --> 04:26.090
We're tired. He's tired.

04:26.090 --> 04:27.259
Uh, everybody is.

04:27.259 --> 04:29.449
I agree, but we still have
a window of time,

04:29.449 --> 04:31.610
and I'm hoping that
we'll get some answers yet.

04:31.610 --> 04:33.999
And I think that's exactly
what we're gonna do.

04:33.999 --> 04:36.940
Yeah. Okay, well, then we do it.

04:36.940 --> 04:38.780
And, you know,
at the end of the year

04:38.780 --> 04:40.039
we'll have no regrets.

04:40.039 --> 04:41.590
Sounds good.
All right, Craig.

04:41.590 --> 04:43.139
Okay.
Thanks for The time.

04:43.139 --> 04:47.939
RICK: See you.
MARTY: See you soon.

04:47.939 --> 04:54.460
NARRATOR: Following
his meeting in the war room...

04:54.460 --> 04:56.810
Hi, Rick.
Good morning.

04:56.810 --> 04:59.770
...Rick Lagina joins other
members of the Oak Island team

04:59.770 --> 05:01.270
at the Money Pit site,

05:01.270 --> 05:03.889
where they are continuing
efforts to excavate

05:03.889 --> 05:06.589
the exploratory borehole
known as S6.

05:09.689 --> 05:11.820
So, we stuck an... stuck
another can on this morning,

05:12.120 --> 05:16.800
and our casing teeth is
at 164 total length now.

05:16.900 --> 05:18.770
Anything come up?
Not yet.

05:18.770 --> 05:20.163
We're kind of
pulling up some mud

05:20.163 --> 05:22.563
and some, what we're
gonna call harder rock, but...

05:22.663 --> 05:24.963
we'd have to, you know,
turn to Terry

05:24.963 --> 05:26.463
on what exactly that rock is.

05:27.763 --> 05:30.189
We're getting mostly
carbonaceous sediments,

05:30.189 --> 05:33.050
bedded sediments,
and a little bit of wood.

05:33.050 --> 05:34.999
So we're still in the influence,
I would say,

05:34.999 --> 05:36.910
of the debris field.

05:36.910 --> 05:40.220
NARRATOR:
While drilling at this same

05:40.220 --> 05:42.139
site just three days ago...

05:42.139 --> 05:44.849
DOUG:
That's a lot of wood, Terry.

05:44.849 --> 05:47.240
That's a nice chunk.
Look at The flat surface there.

05:47.240 --> 05:50.490
...the Oak Island team
penetrated a hard wooden object

05:50.490 --> 05:53.199
at a depth of 101 feet,

05:53.199 --> 05:58.129
which they believe to be
the socalled Shaft Six tunnel,

05:58.129 --> 06:01.720
a searcher tunnel
constructed in 1861

06:01.720 --> 06:05.249
which connects directly to
the original Money Pit shaft.

06:05.249 --> 06:07.470
CHARLES:
That's some big timbers.

06:07.470 --> 06:10.520
But as they continued
to drill deeper,

06:10.520 --> 06:12.580
Rick and the team
made what could be

06:12.580 --> 06:15.439
one of their most significant
discoveries so far:

06:15.439 --> 06:19.379
That's oak.
a handcut oak timber,

06:19.379 --> 06:20.969
the same kind reportedly used

06:20.969 --> 06:24.650
to construct the original
Money Pit centuries ago.

06:24.650 --> 06:29.590
It is the team's belief that
the discovery of this timber,

06:29.590 --> 06:31.599
as well as possible
leather bookbinding

06:31.599 --> 06:35.419
and iron chain, are evidence
of the massive collapse

06:35.419 --> 06:39.050
that occurred
in the Money Pit in 1861

06:39.050 --> 06:42.339
and which left a debris field
of potential artifacts

06:42.339 --> 06:45.699
and treasure scattered
across the Shaft Six tunnel.

06:45.699 --> 06:48.550
I think at this point

06:48.550 --> 06:50.979
we should take the material
to the wash plant,

06:50.979 --> 06:53.340
and what we'll do is
we'll wash it,

06:53.340 --> 06:56.469
and then we'll take
the intermediary back to this,

06:56.469 --> 06:57.910
That wash table...
That's where I sent

06:57.910 --> 06:58.910
the last one,

06:58.910 --> 07:00.099
down to The wash plant.
Okay.

07:00.099 --> 07:01.650
I'd just continue to do that,

07:01.650 --> 07:03.419
unless something comes up
of "some significance,"

07:03.419 --> 07:06.430
and then we'll go back
to the wash table.

07:06.430 --> 07:07.430
Okay.

07:07.430 --> 07:09.649
NARRATOR:
In order to thoroughly examine

07:09.649 --> 07:12.319
the spoils being excavated
from the S6 shaft,

07:12.319 --> 07:16.289
the team has decided to use
the largescale wash plant

07:16.289 --> 07:19.939
located near Smith's Cove.

07:19.939 --> 07:21.830
As each load
of earth and material

07:21.830 --> 07:25.479
is fed into the machine, they
will automatically be cleaned

07:25.479 --> 07:27.610
and sorted according to size,

07:27.610 --> 07:30.899
allowing them to be
carefully searched by hand

07:30.899 --> 07:35.210
for any important artifacts
and, hopefully, treasure.

07:35.210 --> 07:38.889
Hey, Bill.
Hey, Rick.

07:38.889 --> 07:41.650
So... what's up?

07:41.650 --> 07:44.819
Well, this is what we found

07:44.819 --> 07:46.599
so far off the wash plant line.

07:46.599 --> 07:47.599
S6?
Yep.

07:47.599 --> 07:50.550
RICK:
What do you make of it?

07:50.550 --> 07:53.110
Well, it's a few
cool little things.

07:53.110 --> 07:55.101
I'm not a pottery expert,
but some of it

07:55.101 --> 07:57.409
looks pretty...
What is that?

07:57.409 --> 07:58.409
Pipe stem?

07:58.409 --> 08:01.249
BILLY:
Kind of looks like a pipe stem.

08:01.249 --> 08:05.729
But our guess...
This is The chewing end?

08:05.729 --> 08:08.469
BILLY:
Yeah, where it tapers down.

08:08.469 --> 08:10.289
That fits in the pipe.

08:10.289 --> 08:11.660
That's interesting.
Yep.

08:11.660 --> 08:13.719
Oh, this is...
this is cool stuff.

08:13.719 --> 08:14.719
Yeah.
No question about that.

08:14.719 --> 08:18.639
To me, this speaks
to two things.

08:18.639 --> 08:20.089
Human beings were down there,

08:20.089 --> 08:23.869
so it's either these items
came from the shaft,

08:23.869 --> 08:28.399
or someone was in a tunnel
associated with the Money Pit.

08:28.399 --> 08:30.800
To me, that's huge.
Yeah, exactly.

08:30.800 --> 08:34.240
RICK: We have a container
literally filled to the brim

08:34.240 --> 08:38.630
with objects that have
been found on the wash plant.

08:38.630 --> 08:41.539
There's certainly pieces
of pottery,

08:41.539 --> 08:43.811
little bits of glass,

08:43.811 --> 08:46.509
but you don't know
what it means, other than:

08:46.509 --> 08:49.440
people were down
at those depths doing something.

08:49.440 --> 08:51.069
DOUG:
160?

08:51.069 --> 08:55.160
TERRY:
Yeah, yeah, there's there.

08:55.160 --> 08:57.610
Hey, Rick.
Hey.

08:57.610 --> 08:59.339
This came up
from the wash plant,

08:59.339 --> 09:03.200
and Billy was kind enough
to get his guys on it.

09:03.200 --> 09:04.990
Right.
So...

09:04.990 --> 09:05.990
that...

09:05.990 --> 09:09.190
To me, that's fairly old glass.

09:09.190 --> 09:11.990
TERRY:
Mm, that looks very old, yeah.

09:11.990 --> 09:14.720
And then we have
pieces of pottery,

09:14.720 --> 09:16.769
which Laird will have to render

09:16.769 --> 09:18.620
an opinion about.
TERRY: Oh, wow.

09:18.620 --> 09:20.420
Laird will be interested
in that.

09:20.420 --> 09:21.420
Yep.

09:21.420 --> 09:23.019
DOUG:
That's people on there.

09:23.019 --> 09:26.970
JARDINE: Really?
They're going over a bridge.

09:26.970 --> 09:28.100
TERRY:
Interesting.

09:28.100 --> 09:29.440
DOUG:
We saw some of that

09:29.440 --> 09:32.490
last year out of H8.

09:32.490 --> 09:35.839
NARRATOR: Pottery? Similar
to pieces the team has found

09:35.839 --> 09:42.420
in Borehole H8,
located just ten feet away?

09:42.420 --> 09:44.019
It was also in H8,

09:44.019 --> 09:47.889
one year ago, that Rick
and Marty encountered an object

09:47.889 --> 09:51.170
they believed to be
a sevenfoothigh wooden vault,

09:51.170 --> 09:52.649
first reported
by treasure hunters

09:52.649 --> 09:57.620
Frederick Blair
and William Chappell in 1897.

09:57.620 --> 09:59.459
Could the pottery
the team has just found

09:59.459 --> 10:02.519
in the S6 spoils
be further evidence

10:02.519 --> 10:04.180
that they have located
the tunnel

10:04.180 --> 10:09.269
connected directly
to the original Money Pit?

10:09.269 --> 10:12.660
RICK:
This looks old to me.

10:12.660 --> 10:13.660
TERRY:
Oh, look at that.

10:13.660 --> 10:16.399
Now, that's a re...

10:16.399 --> 10:21.709
RICK:
This looks old to me.

10:21.709 --> 10:26.889
Oh, look at that!
Now that's a re...

10:26.889 --> 10:30.270
NARRATOR:
In the Money Pit area,

10:30.270 --> 10:32.959
Rick Lagina and members
of the Oak Island team

10:32.959 --> 10:36.329
have just made a potentially
significant discovery

10:36.329 --> 10:39.690
while examing the spoils
excavated from Borehole S6.

10:39.690 --> 10:42.410
Look at the glaze on that.

10:42.410 --> 10:45.209
That's pretty crude,
like an earthenware.

10:45.209 --> 10:46.209
RICK:
Yup.

10:46.209 --> 10:48.579
Does that indicate age?
I don't know.

10:48.579 --> 10:52.089
But some of these things are...
surely quite unique.

10:52.089 --> 10:53.970
Yeah.
We've never seen them before.

10:53.970 --> 10:56.100
Yeah. That'sthat's a bubble
in the glaze,

10:56.100 --> 10:58.339
a flaw.
RICK: Mmhmm.

10:58.339 --> 11:00.040
TERRY:
Careless work or age,

11:00.040 --> 11:01.630
I'm not sure which.

11:01.630 --> 11:04.569
Well, Laird will be interested
in that.

11:04.569 --> 11:06.110
RICK:
We did find some pottery

11:06.110 --> 11:10.410
of the kind that we have
not found as of yet.

11:10.410 --> 11:13.360
So, we need to bring
those items to Laird.

11:13.360 --> 11:15.160
And we've got
an enormous amount

11:15.160 --> 11:18.140
of wash plant material
to go through, so,

11:18.140 --> 11:21.009
there's still hope
that the one thing is

11:21.009 --> 11:24.129
in those, uh, materials.

11:24.129 --> 11:30.110
Good job, guys.
Let's keep digging.

11:30.110 --> 11:32.650
NARRATOR:
The next day,

11:32.650 --> 11:35.730
Rick Lagina and Craig Tester,
along with island

11:35.730 --> 11:38.090
historians Doug Crowell
and Paul Troutman,

11:38.090 --> 11:41.990
meet with archeologist
Laird Niven in the war room.

11:41.990 --> 11:44.670
Again, Laird, welcome back.
Thank you.

11:44.670 --> 11:46.110
NARRATOR:
After finding pieces

11:46.110 --> 11:47.129
of what could be

11:47.129 --> 11:50.290
ancient pottery
in Borehole S6,

11:50.290 --> 11:52.540
Rick is eager
for Laird to examine them

11:52.540 --> 11:54.899
and confirm whether or not
they might date

11:54.899 --> 11:59.029
to before the Money Pit's
discovery in 1795.

11:59.029 --> 12:01.470
I've been on and on and on,

12:01.470 --> 12:03.490
almost ad nauseam,
everybody knows.

12:03.490 --> 12:05.490
I always thought
the way to unravel

12:05.490 --> 12:08.120
the Money Pit mystery was, uh,

12:08.120 --> 12:09.540
to find the tunnel, the tunnel

12:09.540 --> 12:12.319
between Shaft Six
and the Money Pit.

12:12.319 --> 12:14.589
We did make some finds,

12:14.589 --> 12:17.039
and I'd like you
toto weigh in on them.

12:17.039 --> 12:18.150
Okay.
and to have a Look

12:18.150 --> 12:20.320
for yourself.

12:22.000 --> 12:28.074
-= www.OpenSubtitles.org =-

12:31.020 --> 12:32.290
This is kind of
an interesting case.

12:32.290 --> 12:33.880
Yes, you have a pattern,

12:33.880 --> 12:36.350
an identifiable
Blue Willow pattern

12:36.350 --> 12:38.850
that was used
for a number of years.

12:38.850 --> 12:40.970
This is aa transfer print
that had been

12:40.970 --> 12:42.540
used over and over again.

12:42.540 --> 12:43.540
So, we're gonna say...

12:43.540 --> 12:48.290
1810s to 1840s.

12:48.290 --> 12:49.290
Oh?

12:49.290 --> 12:51.339
hmm.
PAUL: Okay.

12:51.339 --> 12:55.079
Now this is a really cool piece
right there.

12:55.079 --> 13:02.220
LAIRD:
So that's a pipe bit.

13:02.220 --> 13:03.410
See...

13:03.410 --> 13:05.459
this is so obviously
not a clay pipe.

13:05.459 --> 13:06.730
PAUL:
Yeah.

13:06.730 --> 13:08.009
LAIRD:
Um...

13:08.009 --> 13:11.209
this wouldn't be
out of place in...

13:11.209 --> 13:13.850
in the 1870s, 1880s.

13:13.850 --> 13:15.410
Mmhmm.
I would say

13:15.410 --> 13:17.920
it's probably post1850.

13:17.920 --> 13:23.560
RICK:
Might be a little piece

13:23.560 --> 13:25.759
of history.

13:25.759 --> 13:32.100
That's a big piece of stoneware,

13:32.100 --> 13:35.760
redbodied stoneware.

13:35.760 --> 13:37.579
Hmm.

13:44.279 --> 13:47.089
It's got a pretty
highlyfired red body.

13:47.889 --> 13:50.569
I've seen a lot
of pottery from...

13:50.569 --> 13:53.500
from Oak Island, but see this?

13:53.500 --> 13:56.800
See the striations
on the outside? I haven't

13:56.800 --> 13:58.689
seen That before.
Oh?

13:58.689 --> 14:00.329
It's almost made with a...

14:00.329 --> 14:02.310
like a comb
or tool of some sort.

14:02.310 --> 14:04.209
And what does that tell you?

14:04.209 --> 14:07.060
Well, this would be the one
thing that could be earlier.

14:07.060 --> 14:09.819
Oh. How early?

14:09.819 --> 14:12.689
I would put it...

14:12.689 --> 14:14.040
in the early,

14:14.040 --> 14:17.490
possibly in the earlier part
of the 1700s.

14:17.490 --> 14:22.290
So this is the kind of thing
you were hoping for.

14:22.290 --> 14:25.310
Really?
Yeah.

14:25.310 --> 14:28.630
NARRATOR:
Stoneware pottery?

14:28.630 --> 14:32.779
Dating back to the early 1700s?

14:32.779 --> 14:35.269
Could this piece of pottery
be definitive proof

14:35.269 --> 14:37.339
of human activity
deep underground

14:37.339 --> 14:39.060
in the Money Pit area

14:39.060 --> 14:44.360
prior to the treasure shaft's
discovery in 1795?

14:44.360 --> 14:47.439
And if so, could it validate
the team's belief

14:47.439 --> 14:50.470
that they intercepted part
of the socalled debris field

14:50.470 --> 14:53.930
in Borehole S6?

14:53.930 --> 14:55.240
Having you be surprised

14:55.240 --> 14:56.240
isis... isis important.

14:56.240 --> 14:57.579
Mmhmm.
I mean, obviously,

14:57.579 --> 14:59.260
you know, you've looked at

14:59.260 --> 15:03.999
a myriad number of things,
and this is, really for you,

15:03.999 --> 15:05.810
it's the first real "Aha."
Yeah.

15:05.810 --> 15:07.370
It is, definitely.

15:07.370 --> 15:09.450
RICK:
So, given that,

15:09.450 --> 15:10.450
this may be evidence

15:10.450 --> 15:12.800
that, you know,
there's much earlier activity

15:12.800 --> 15:15.680
on the island
than we had, um... supposed.

15:15.680 --> 15:17.680
Yup. I agree.

15:17.680 --> 15:20.350
That's great.
CRAIG: Definitely.

15:20.350 --> 15:22.360
Yup.
RICK: So,

15:22.360 --> 15:27.839
thank you, Laird.
Laird: Yeah.

15:27.839 --> 15:30.430
NARRATOR:
Later that day...

15:30.430 --> 15:31.939
Hey, guys.
Hey.

15:31.939 --> 15:32.939
Hey, Rick.

15:32.939 --> 15:36.040
...Rick Lagina arrives
in the Money Pit area

15:36.040 --> 15:38.279
after receiving
an important call

15:38.279 --> 15:40.990
from representatives
of Irving Equipment Limited

15:40.990 --> 15:42.510
concerning Borehole S6.

15:42.510 --> 15:45.269
I'm sure you've got
some information here,

15:45.269 --> 15:47.129
but but before you do that,
let me get Craig

15:47.129 --> 15:49.600
up on The line.
TERRY: Okay.

15:49.600 --> 15:51.279
NARRATOR:
Although Craig Tester is

15:51.279 --> 15:53.459
currently off the island,

15:53.459 --> 15:56.699
Rick is eager for his partner,
who is also an engineer,

15:56.699 --> 15:58.740
to weigh in
on any new decisions.

15:58.740 --> 16:01.100
Craig, you there? Hello?

16:01.100 --> 16:02.860
RICK:
Yeah, Craig.

16:02.860 --> 16:06.279
I'll let Danny give you
thethe digging details,

16:06.279 --> 16:07.779
and then Terry will render
an opinion

16:07.779 --> 16:10.060
about the geology
we're encountering.

16:10.060 --> 16:14.980
And then, each of us will
weigh in as to where we sit.

16:14.980 --> 16:18.050
Here's Dan... here's Danny.

16:18.050 --> 16:19.579
Hello, Craig.

16:19.579 --> 16:22.500
I got some numbers for you.

16:22.500 --> 16:27.230
We have a total
of 216 feet of casing.

16:27.230 --> 16:30.900
190 of it is in the ground.

16:30.900 --> 16:33.570
We have a hole depth of 175.

16:33.570 --> 16:37.399
We have a plug of 15 foot.

16:37.399 --> 16:41.050
That's what...
that's what we got.

16:41.050 --> 16:44.330
Here's Terry's understanding
of the geology.

16:44.330 --> 16:49.579
So, we're definitely below the
level of the bedrock plateau.

16:49.579 --> 16:51.550
Most of the material is

16:51.550 --> 16:57.430
groundup, uh,
limestonerich sediment.

16:57.430 --> 16:59.570
Just fairly classic,
fairly straightforward material

16:59.570 --> 17:01.269
that we've encountered
in a number of places

17:01.269 --> 17:04.250
when we've gone
into the solution channel.

17:04.250 --> 17:07.410
NARRATOR:
News that the 60inchwide

17:07.410 --> 17:08.410
drilling caisson

17:08.410 --> 17:12.680
has encountered limestone
bedrock at a depth of 190 feet

17:12.680 --> 17:15.540
is a disappointing development.

17:15.540 --> 17:19.810
It indicates
that the S6 shaft has now dug

17:19.810 --> 17:22.310
well below
the believed debris field

17:22.310 --> 17:23.880
and the possible location

17:23.880 --> 17:26.390
of any more valuable clues
or objects.

17:26.390 --> 17:30.430
Rick, I'll just let you
take it from there.

17:30.430 --> 17:31.430
Yeah, so,

17:31.430 --> 17:34.550
II'm of the position that

17:34.550 --> 17:36.530
we're not gonna encounter
anything further

17:36.530 --> 17:41.270
that will direct us
where to go next.

17:41.270 --> 17:42.420
I guess what it comes down to,

17:42.420 --> 17:44.950
I would strongly advocate
that we...

17:44.950 --> 17:47.700
we end the hole,
andand, you know,

17:47.700 --> 17:51.200
do everything we need to do to
set up onto the next location.

17:51.200 --> 17:53.770
RICK:
I'm disappointed.

17:53.770 --> 17:56.350
I was hoping for the one thing.

17:56.350 --> 17:59.170
And unfortunately,
wewe took a swing,

17:59.170 --> 18:01.770
and, yeah, we certainly
didn't hit a home run.

18:01.770 --> 18:03.870
But did we find the one thing?

18:03.870 --> 18:05.520
Nope.
No, we didn't.

18:05.520 --> 18:08.380
You know, maybe...
maybe we were real close.

18:08.380 --> 18:11.650
Um, and I guess
that's what I'm gonna cling to.

18:11.650 --> 18:13.820
Okay. That's what we'll do.

18:13.820 --> 18:15.560
All right. Thanks, Craig.

18:15.560 --> 18:17.300
Good night.
CRAIG: Bye.

18:17.300 --> 18:19.720
Okay. That's what we'll do then.

18:19.720 --> 18:22.880
We're done.

18:22.880 --> 18:30.760
TERRY:
Okay. See you later.

18:30.760 --> 18:37.070
RICK:
See you tomorrow.

18:37.070 --> 18:39.840
NARRATOR:
As a new day dawns

18:39.840 --> 18:42.360
on Oak Island,

18:42.360 --> 18:44.580
Rick Lagina joins
heavy equipment operator

18:44.580 --> 18:46.650
Billy Gerhardt at Smith's Cove.

18:46.650 --> 18:49.460
Okay, we have the extension.
That's great news.

18:49.460 --> 18:50.460
NARRATOR:
Having received

18:50.460 --> 18:51.690
the necessary permits

18:51.690 --> 18:55.490
to expand their excavation
into the beach area,

18:55.490 --> 18:59.520
Rick is eager to start removing
the 6,000 squarefoot crane pad

18:59.520 --> 19:03.060
so that the team can dig in
search of the convergence point

19:03.060 --> 19:05.490
leading
to a manmade flood tunnel.

19:05.490 --> 19:09.060
A tunnel which the team hopes
can be traced back

19:09.060 --> 19:11.690
to the legendary
Money Pit treasure vault.

19:11.690 --> 19:15.200
RICK:
What do you think?

19:15.200 --> 19:16.550
Deconstructing,
what's the timeline?

19:16.550 --> 19:19.220
You can do it in a hurry if
you're not fussy where it goes,

19:19.220 --> 19:21.670
But you know that...
Aah...

19:21.670 --> 19:24.360
Being not fussy means ultimately
more work, more time.

19:24.360 --> 19:25.390
Yeah, that's what I think,
too, right?

19:25.390 --> 19:28.210
So... so, it's about putting
the material here

19:28.210 --> 19:29.420
That we have room for.
Mmhmm.

19:29.420 --> 19:32.560
And the rest we have to put in
the truck and truck up the hill.

19:32.560 --> 19:33.940
NARRATOR:
In order to build

19:33.940 --> 19:35.810
the massive cofferdam,

19:35.810 --> 19:38.800
the team from Irving Equipment
Limited had to first move

19:38.800 --> 19:42.330
some 2,500 tons of earth
and gravel to construct

19:42.330 --> 19:46.320
a foundation strong enough
to support a 300ton crane.

19:46.320 --> 19:48.610
It looks like
a really sturdy pad.

19:48.610 --> 19:50.560
NARRATOR:
This material,

19:50.560 --> 19:52.240
along with
the several hundred tons

19:52.240 --> 19:56.070
of spoils displaced during the
excavation of Smith's Cove

19:56.070 --> 19:57.650
must now be relocated

19:57.650 --> 20:00.450
in order for the team
to dig beneath the crane pad.

20:00.450 --> 20:02.700
RICK:
Well, bottom line is,

20:02.700 --> 20:03.700
let's start.

20:03.700 --> 20:05.840
We'll be ready.
All righty.

20:05.840 --> 20:07.870
NARRATOR:
As work to remove the crane pad

20:07.870 --> 20:11.080
begins at Smith's Cove,

20:11.080 --> 20:13.190
Rick Lagina heads
to the research center

20:13.190 --> 20:16.510
to meet with historians
Doug Crowell and Paul Troutman

20:16.510 --> 20:18.920
regarding the team's plans
moving forward

20:18.920 --> 20:20.040
in the Money Pit area.

20:20.040 --> 20:21.980
DOUG: Hey, Rick.
Good morning.

20:21.980 --> 20:23.910
Good morning.
Okay, today, uh,

20:23.910 --> 20:25.850
you know, we've got, uh,

20:25.850 --> 20:27.350
not a difficult choice,

20:27.350 --> 20:29.640
but certainly
an important choice ahead of us.

20:29.640 --> 20:33.490
Um, you know,
I had high hopes for S6.

20:33.490 --> 20:34.490
Uh, unfortunately,
we only got

20:34.490 --> 20:36.860
more clues, which beget more...

20:36.860 --> 20:39.170
more questions.
Paul, your opinion?

20:39.170 --> 20:42.340
You know, we could be close
to the Money Pit.

20:42.340 --> 20:45.080
That's what I feel we're in
because of those new timbers.

20:45.080 --> 20:46.970
It could be from any number
of shafts, but the fact

20:46.970 --> 20:49.360
that they're solid oak,
some of these,

20:49.360 --> 20:53.760
that says to me that it might be
original Money Pit.

20:53.760 --> 20:56.490
We have but one can today

20:56.490 --> 20:58.760
that we have to put a pin in.

20:58.760 --> 20:59.760
What's your choice?

20:59.760 --> 21:03.010
PAUL:
I would actually go

21:03.010 --> 21:04.970
to this location.

21:04.970 --> 21:08.510
NARRATOR:
Two weeks ago, the Laginas

21:08.510 --> 21:09.800
and their partners hired

21:09.800 --> 21:11.820
professional surveyor
Steve Guptill

21:11.820 --> 21:14.580
to compile the records
of previous searchers

21:14.580 --> 21:16.570
from the past two centuries.

21:16.570 --> 21:19.500
STEVE G.:
Here's just a quick overview

21:19.500 --> 21:21.140
of everything
that has been drilled up there.

21:21.140 --> 21:23.000
NARRATOR:
By combining this data

21:23.000 --> 21:24.650
along with
the more recent efforts

21:24.650 --> 21:26.750
of the Oak Island team,

21:26.750 --> 21:30.060
Steve was able to create
a virtual master map,

21:30.060 --> 21:32.260
one that Rick hopes
will help them locate

21:32.260 --> 21:35.050
the original
Money Pit treasure shaft.

21:35.050 --> 21:39.090
PAUL:
So, from about 103 to 120,

21:39.090 --> 21:41.120
we did come into
conglomerations of wood,

21:41.120 --> 21:42.810
and we found
all those pieces of wood,

21:42.810 --> 21:44.360
which were really interesting.

21:44.360 --> 21:47.210
So, we possibly did hit
into a shaft

21:47.210 --> 21:48.870
or a tunnel like we're finding.
The problem is

21:48.870 --> 21:50.720
we found so much wood

21:50.720 --> 21:53.520
of different size,
shape and construction.

21:53.520 --> 21:55.220
But I feel like we're close
in this area.

21:55.220 --> 21:57.630
Whether it goes west or north,

21:57.630 --> 22:00.230
we'rewe're definitely
somewhere around in here.

22:00.230 --> 22:02.850
Presently, we're right here,

22:02.850 --> 22:05.460
so I would go further north,
and this is a...

22:05.460 --> 22:06.762
a good location to go to.

22:06.762 --> 22:08.840
I think the debris field
will possibly go up,

22:08.840 --> 22:10.520
and this could be
the Money Pit area.

22:10.520 --> 22:12.910
But we're gonna have
to explore it and find out.

22:12.910 --> 22:13.910
Doug?

22:13.910 --> 22:16.030
DOUG:
I agree with Paul.

22:16.030 --> 22:19.380
I think the preponderance
of evidence that we have so far,

22:19.380 --> 22:20.960
it's circumstantial,

22:20.960 --> 22:23.200
but the pottery turned out
to be really interesting.

22:23.200 --> 22:26.640
So, is that a sign that we're
really close to the Money Pit?

22:26.640 --> 22:27.810
RICK:
We're starting

22:27.810 --> 22:30.200
to get
to real interesting pieces.

22:30.200 --> 22:32.060
We're creating
quite a mosaic, but...

22:32.060 --> 22:33.490
DOUG:
Clues are questions,

22:33.490 --> 22:36.300
Not answers.
Yes, exactly. Well said.

22:36.300 --> 22:37.340
But I think

22:37.340 --> 22:39.800
for right now, today,

22:39.800 --> 22:42.940
the location
that we need toto put an "X" on

22:42.940 --> 22:45.300
isis that one right there.
FG5.5.

22:45.300 --> 22:47.840
NARRATOR:
Based on their discoveries

22:47.840 --> 22:49.150
in the S6 shaft,

22:49.150 --> 22:50.870
it is the team's belief

22:50.870 --> 22:53.650
that they may have intercepted
the Shaft Six tunnel

22:53.650 --> 22:58.150
and that their new site
known as FG5.5,

22:58.150 --> 23:00.410
which is located
some five feet north

23:00.410 --> 23:01.610
and on the same line,

23:01.610 --> 23:07.220
could be on target to hit
the original Money Pit itself.

23:07.220 --> 23:09.220
That whole area is of interest.

23:09.220 --> 23:10.690
H8 is close by.

23:10.690 --> 23:12.540
The Hedden Shaft is close by.

23:12.540 --> 23:14.300
Chappell Shaft is close by.

23:14.300 --> 23:16.800
We're still on the track
of the supposed tunnel

23:16.800 --> 23:19.640
associated with
the original Money Pit, but...

23:19.640 --> 23:22.580
There's a lot of
interesting information there,

23:22.580 --> 23:25.060
but where is the vault?

23:25.060 --> 23:29.810
Okay, Paul,
put a lucky "X" on that spot.

23:29.810 --> 23:33.030
"X" marks the spot.
"X" marks the spot.

23:33.030 --> 23:35.060
NARRATOR:
As Rick, Doug and Paul

23:35.060 --> 23:36.170
conclude their meeting

23:36.170 --> 23:37.820
in the Oak Island
Research Center...

23:37.820 --> 23:39.820
GARY: Lot 21, Jack.
JACK: Mmhmm.

23:39.820 --> 23:43.640
...Jack Begley and metal
detection expert Gary Drayton

23:43.640 --> 23:44.980
head to Lot 21.

23:44.980 --> 23:47.660
There's a lot of history
in this area.

23:47.660 --> 23:49.030
Yeah.
And it's opposite

23:49.030 --> 23:51.990
The McGinnis foundation.
Mmhmm.

23:51.990 --> 23:54.480
So with this little coil,

23:54.480 --> 23:55.940
hopefully we can get
in between the iron

23:55.940 --> 23:57.910
and find something good.

23:57.910 --> 24:00.300
JACK:
Mmhmm.

24:00.300 --> 24:02.700
I'll zigzag down the hill.

24:02.700 --> 24:06.260
I'm gonna go really slow
and try and winkle out

24:06.260 --> 24:08.090
some good signals.

24:08.090 --> 24:09.290
NARRATOR:
In light of their

24:09.290 --> 24:10.670
significant new finds

24:10.670 --> 24:12.480
at the Money Pit site,

24:12.480 --> 24:14.900
the team is eager to look
for more clues

24:14.900 --> 24:17.040
by continuing
their investigation

24:17.040 --> 24:18.980
into one of the men
who first uncovered

24:18.980 --> 24:22.230
the treasure shaft in 1795:

24:22.230 --> 24:25.370
Daniel McGinnis.

24:25.370 --> 24:27.530
Not long after McGinnis
and two friends

24:27.530 --> 24:29.690
made their
lifechanging discovery,

24:29.690 --> 24:31.820
he purchased Lot 21

24:31.820 --> 24:33.480
on the western end
of the island

24:33.480 --> 24:35.140
and built a home,

24:35.140 --> 24:36.940
where he spent the remainder
of his life

24:36.940 --> 24:38.730
raising a family,

24:38.730 --> 24:42.450
farming
and searching for treasure.

24:42.450 --> 24:45.510
Although the house
has long since weathered away,

24:45.510 --> 24:48.980
the stone foundation remains
a protected historical site

24:48.980 --> 24:50.510
on Oak Island.

24:50.510 --> 24:52.940
However, it is the team's hope

24:52.940 --> 24:54.880
that by searching nearby
on the property

24:54.880 --> 24:56.770
McGinnis once owned,

24:56.770 --> 24:58.650
they might find important clues

24:58.650 --> 25:01.190
or precious objects
he may have recovered

25:01.190 --> 25:04.070
from the Money Pit
centuries ago,

25:04.070 --> 25:05.600
such as the goldplated brooch

25:05.600 --> 25:08.670
discovered on this same lot
earlier this year,

25:08.670 --> 25:10.570
which was determined by experts

25:10.570 --> 25:13.520
to be as much as 700 years old.

25:13.520 --> 25:17.660
GARY:
I'm hearing a bit of iron.

25:17.660 --> 25:21.050
JACK:
It's blinking?

25:21.050 --> 25:23.310
GARY:
Yeah.

25:23.310 --> 25:26.700
That's definitely modern.

25:26.700 --> 25:31.160
I can tell it's a higher pitch.

25:31.160 --> 25:33.290
Hey, that's not iron.

25:33.290 --> 25:36.370
Yeah, that doesn't sound
too bad, actually.

25:36.370 --> 25:37.370
(detector whing)

25:37.370 --> 25:39.020
Yeah, let's get this one, Jack.

25:39.020 --> 25:40.350
That doesn't sound too bad.

25:40.350 --> 25:43.140
Ooh, I think I've got one
over here, as well,

25:43.140 --> 25:44.470
just behind that.

25:46.370 --> 25:52.070
Let me get a...

25:52.070 --> 25:54.910
All right.

25:54.910 --> 25:55.910
Go on, mate.

25:55.910 --> 25:57.130
Give it some welly.

26:03.130 --> 26:04.400
It might be out, Jack.

26:04.400 --> 26:06.080
Oh, all right.

26:06.080 --> 26:06.770
(detector beeping)

26:08.370 --> 26:10.510
Yeah, that's what it is.
I think you're right.

26:11.710 --> 26:14.880
(sighs) You never know.

26:15.380 --> 26:16.380
(beeping)

26:16.380 --> 26:18.560
JACK:
Come on.

26:18.560 --> 26:20.450
Something good.

26:20.450 --> 26:25.730
GARY:
What? Ooh!

26:25.730 --> 26:30.310
GARY:
Yeah, that's what it is.

26:30.310 --> 26:32.490
NARRATOR
While exploring Lot 21

26:32.490 --> 26:34.660
on the western end
of Oak Island...

26:34.660 --> 26:36.160
JACK:
Come on.

26:36.160 --> 26:37.160
Something good.

26:37.160 --> 26:38.160
(beeping)

26:38.160 --> 26:39.160
GARY:
What? Ooh!

26:39.160 --> 26:42.830
Yeah, that is good, actually.
is That lead?

26:42.830 --> 26:44.350

...Jack Begley

26:45.790 --> 26:48.030
and metal detection expert
Gary Drayton

26:48.030 --> 26:51.920
have just made a potentially
important discovery.

26:51.920 --> 26:53.360
This, actually,

26:53.360 --> 26:54.680
with it being this shape

26:54.680 --> 26:57.330
on both ends,
this had a purpose.

26:57.330 --> 26:59.000
It might... I don't know what.

26:59.000 --> 27:00.480
JACK:
Oh, you think it broke off

27:00.480 --> 27:01.480
from something?

27:01.480 --> 27:02.480
GARY:
Yeah.

27:02.480 --> 27:06.970
Wow. II think
I see decoration on this.

27:06.970 --> 27:08.200
That's pretty cool.
Yeah, it is.

27:08.200 --> 27:09.200
GARY:
'Cause the more

27:09.200 --> 27:10.200
I'm looking at it,

27:10.200 --> 27:11.660
you can see little leaf designs

27:11.660 --> 27:13.270
where it was poured in the mold

27:13.270 --> 27:14.840
or bark of a tree.

27:14.840 --> 27:16.980
JACK: Where?
Do you See that?

27:16.980 --> 27:19.310
Looks like little flowers.

27:19.310 --> 27:21.810
JACK: Oh, yeah.
Along it.

27:21.810 --> 27:23.550
Decorated.
right near The edge.

27:23.550 --> 27:25.100
GARY:
It's gonna be interesting

27:25.100 --> 27:26.100
to see what this is

27:26.100 --> 27:27.260
when it's cleaned up.

27:27.260 --> 27:29.780
All right, mate,
we'll have a little look

27:29.780 --> 27:31.520
and see if we can find
anything else.

27:31.520 --> 27:33.530
Doublecheck the hole.

27:33.530 --> 27:37.000
GARY: It's a different tone.
That's all right.

27:37.000 --> 27:38.000
Ooh!

27:38.000 --> 27:41.820
There's more.
Something in The spoil pile.

27:41.820 --> 27:47.490
Come on, baby,
be something good.

27:47.490 --> 27:51.440
Maybe it's more of this lead.

27:51.440 --> 27:54.290
Ooh. Yeah, it is more of it.
it is more of it.

27:54.290 --> 27:56.430
Oh, man, this is interesting.
Look at that.

27:56.430 --> 27:58.730
Let's get that other piece out.

27:58.730 --> 28:00.090
You think it fits together?

28:00.090 --> 28:01.950
GARY:
Yeah, look at that.

28:01.950 --> 28:03.480
Fits like a glove.

28:03.480 --> 28:04.630
JACK:
Yeah!

28:04.630 --> 28:07.510
GARY:
It's a square hole.

28:07.510 --> 28:09.810
Man, look at that.

28:09.810 --> 28:12.240
you know What
this reminds me of?

28:12.240 --> 28:13.240
What?

28:13.240 --> 28:14.980
The hole in the cross.

28:14.980 --> 28:16.970
NARRATOR:
Lead pieces found on the

28:16.970 --> 28:20.010
property of Daniel McGinnis?

28:20.010 --> 28:22.440
With features similar
to the lead cross discovered

28:22.440 --> 28:24.570
one year ago at Smith's Cove?

28:24.570 --> 28:27.590
Hello, Tobias.
Hi, guys.

28:27.590 --> 28:29.610
NARRATOR:
Earlier this year,

28:29.610 --> 28:31.780
the Oak Island team sought
the expertise

28:31.780 --> 28:34.640
of Tobias Skowronek,
a geochemist

28:34.640 --> 28:37.900
at the German Mining Museum
in Bochum, Germany,

28:37.900 --> 28:41.240
who conducted a lead isotope
analysis on the cross.

28:41.240 --> 28:44.590
I think it's pre15th century.

28:44.590 --> 28:47.770
This could be Templar connected.

28:47.770 --> 28:50.510
NARRATOR:
Using data collected

28:50.510 --> 28:52.480
from laser ablation testing,

28:52.480 --> 28:55.510
he was able to determine
that the lead was mined

28:55.510 --> 28:59.330
over 600 years ago
in a region of Southern France

28:59.330 --> 29:02.320
near a onetime stronghold
of the Knights Templar.

29:02.320 --> 29:06.660
This might be holy shamoly,
part two!

29:06.660 --> 29:07.900
No way!

29:07.900 --> 29:10.370
Sweet!
Yeah, that is.

29:10.370 --> 29:11.560
This is fantastic.

29:11.560 --> 29:14.310
a couple of Good things
to show Rick.

29:14.310 --> 29:15.310
Mmhmm.

29:15.310 --> 29:16.310
JACK:
He'll be really excited

29:16.310 --> 29:18.610
to see this stuff.

29:18.610 --> 29:21.410
NARRATOR:
Following his exciting

29:21.410 --> 29:23.190
discovery on Lot 21,

29:23.190 --> 29:26.940
Gary Drayton heads to the
Oak Island Research Center

29:26.940 --> 29:29.520
to share his latest find
with Rick, Marty

29:29.520 --> 29:31.560
and other members of the team.

29:31.560 --> 29:35.580
Found a really nice decorative
piece of lead on Lot 21.

29:35.580 --> 29:37.160
Oh, really?

29:37.160 --> 29:40.290
And I believe it's really,
really old.

29:40.290 --> 29:42.730
GARY:
When this first came

29:42.730 --> 29:43.730
out the ground,

29:43.730 --> 29:45.670
there was soil stuck to it,

29:45.670 --> 29:48.180
and both Jack and I saw,

29:48.180 --> 29:51.690
like, a floral decorative
pattern on it.

29:51.690 --> 29:53.480
That's the side where we see it.

29:53.480 --> 29:56.950
This is the top side.
You see the little design there?

29:56.950 --> 30:00.950
Seems to... Yeah.
MARTY: Like a rope thing

30:00.950 --> 30:02.530
right here?

30:02.530 --> 30:04.800
PAUL:
Do you think it looks like

30:04.800 --> 30:06.210
a leaf or a vine

30:06.210 --> 30:07.970
that's on the pattern here?

30:07.970 --> 30:10.470
That would be interesting
because the vines are

30:10.470 --> 30:14.530
supposed to be a symbology,
a sacred symbology for

30:14.530 --> 30:17.680
the children of Israel
and the Holy Lands over there.

30:17.680 --> 30:18.740
Yeah, it could be.

30:18.740 --> 30:20.560
PAUL:
I wonder if it has any bearing

30:20.560 --> 30:21.610
to the Tree of Life.

30:21.610 --> 30:23.711
It's another possibility
with symbology on it.

30:23.711 --> 30:26.890
NARRATOR:
The Tree of Life?

30:26.890 --> 30:30.450
The ancient Hebraic symbol the
team found carved on the wall

30:30.450 --> 30:35.060
of a 14th century Templar
prison in Domme, France?

30:35.060 --> 30:37.220
One year ago...
Oh, wow.

30:37.220 --> 30:40.100
...Rick Lagina and his nephews
Alex and Peter

30:40.100 --> 30:43.420
visited Domme, France,
where they were shown carvings

30:43.420 --> 30:46.060
made by members
of the Knights Templar,

30:46.060 --> 30:49.180
including one that depicted
The Tree of Life.

30:49.180 --> 30:53.090
This kabbalistic symbol
features ten points,

30:53.090 --> 30:56.040
known as sefirot, representing
the divine principles

30:56.040 --> 31:00.120
of the human soul
and the spiritual path to God.

31:00.120 --> 31:03.090
Even more astonishing
was a large cross

31:03.090 --> 31:05.020
in the wall next to it,

31:05.020 --> 31:08.100
which, incredibly,
is nearly an exact match

31:08.100 --> 31:13.240
to the lead cross discovered
one year ago at Smith's Cove.

31:13.240 --> 31:15.360
Could the vinelike pattern
found

31:15.360 --> 31:17.560
on the newly discovered
lead artifact

31:17.560 --> 31:19.910
really symbolize
the Tree of Life?

31:19.910 --> 31:24.790
And, if so, could it also be
related to the medieval cross?

31:24.790 --> 31:29.690
Jack and I,
we found one long strip of lead,

31:29.690 --> 31:32.460
and then, at the side of it,
we found another little piece.

31:32.460 --> 31:35.650
And when we put 'em together,
we noticed

31:35.650 --> 31:37.290
there was a square hole

31:37.290 --> 31:40.690
similar in size to the one

31:40.690 --> 31:42.190
in The cross. Yeah.
in The cross.

31:42.190 --> 31:44.670
MARTY: Can I See that?
PAUL: Yeah, we actually have

31:44.670 --> 31:46.480
a small piece right here.

31:46.480 --> 31:48.170
GARY:
Wow.

31:48.170 --> 31:50.560
MARTY:
And you found those

31:50.560 --> 31:52.170
right next to each other?
Yeah.

31:52.170 --> 31:53.790
Yeah.
So, they definitely...

31:53.790 --> 31:56.230
belong to each other.
Fit... Right.

31:56.230 --> 31:57.230
GARY:
Once you put

31:57.230 --> 31:58.770
those two pieces together,

31:58.770 --> 32:00.940
and I saw

32:00.940 --> 32:03.890
so much similarities
between this

32:03.890 --> 32:06.590
and the cross
that came out of Smith's Cove.

32:06.590 --> 32:10.450
And especially
the square hole as well.

32:10.450 --> 32:13.120
MARTY:
Yeah, I see that, Gary.

32:13.120 --> 32:14.150
Definitely a square hole.

32:14.150 --> 32:15.250
GARY:
It looks like

32:15.250 --> 32:18.130
it's got a square hole
on the other end.

32:18.130 --> 32:20.600
Itit looked like it was tacked,

32:20.600 --> 32:23.230
nailed on to something.

32:23.230 --> 32:24.230
And I would imagine,

32:24.230 --> 32:27.740
if it was part
of a larger cross,

32:27.740 --> 32:31.680
it would've been nailed
onto wood with square nails,

32:31.680 --> 32:34.190
little square nails.
Well,

32:34.190 --> 32:36.720
obviously, this cries out to

32:36.720 --> 32:38.390
where did the lead come from
testing.

32:38.390 --> 32:39.800
RICK: Exactly.
Yeah.

32:39.800 --> 32:42.090
MARTY:
We have to test the lead, Gary.

32:42.090 --> 32:44.180
It would go from
eh, what is it to "dramatic"

32:44.180 --> 32:47.270
if This was mined
at RennesleChteau.

32:47.270 --> 32:48.270
RICK: Yeah.

32:48.270 --> 32:49.560
Yep. Laser ablation.
GARY: Yeah.

32:49.560 --> 32:51.890
I mean, this has got a really,

32:51.890 --> 32:53.380
really old feel about it.

32:53.380 --> 32:55.600
I think you guys
are gonna be surprised

32:55.600 --> 32:57.640
once we get This tested.
good.

32:57.640 --> 32:58.940
RICK:
Of all the tests

32:58.940 --> 32:59.940
we've conducted,

32:59.940 --> 33:00.970
all the analytics applied

33:00.970 --> 33:02.680
to all kinds of science,

33:02.680 --> 33:05.440
laser ablation
really has been, uh,

33:05.440 --> 33:07.340
probably the most definitive.

33:07.340 --> 33:09.140
So why wouldn't we get it
tested?

33:09.140 --> 33:12.600
It takes a lot to float my boat
when it comes to lead,

33:12.600 --> 33:13.600
but... this has.

33:13.600 --> 33:15.630
You know,
it's hard to disbelieve you,

33:15.630 --> 33:16.130
Yeah.

33:16.130 --> 33:17.830
because you've said that many
more than a few times,

33:17.830 --> 33:18.830
Mm.

33:18.830 --> 33:19.830
and you've been correct
every single time.

33:19.830 --> 33:20.830
All right,

33:20.830 --> 33:22.110
well, keep finding, Gary.
Keep looking.

33:22.110 --> 33:25.150
and you guys keep analyzing.
Yeah, we'll keep at it, Marty.

33:25.150 --> 33:27.250
we got a million things to do.
Let's go.

33:27.250 --> 33:28.250
Yeah.

33:28.250 --> 33:29.300
Well done, Gary.
Yep.

33:29.300 --> 33:32.340
If there's a piece of metal,
you'll find it.

33:32.340 --> 33:39.100
That's what I'm here for.
Yep.

33:39.100 --> 33:41.940
Three days after the
discovery of a lead artifact

33:41.940 --> 33:42.950
on Lot 21...

33:42.950 --> 33:45.150
Good morning.
VANESSA: Hello!

33:45.150 --> 33:47.320
I should say "good afternoon."

33:47.320 --> 33:49.020
...Rick, Doug and Paul

33:49.020 --> 33:52.270
join surveyor Steve Guptill
in the Money Pit area,

33:52.270 --> 33:55.580
where the team from Irving
Equipment Limited has begun

33:55.580 --> 33:58.210
to remove
the 60inchwide steel caisson

33:58.210 --> 34:01.170
from the S6 shaft.

34:01.170 --> 34:03.580
Having abandoned
their excavation there,

34:03.580 --> 34:05.830
the team has decided
to repurpose

34:05.830 --> 34:07.600
the massive steel sections

34:07.600 --> 34:09.760
to dig
their new exploratory borehole

34:09.760 --> 34:12.040
in search
of the original Money Pit.

34:12.040 --> 34:15.489
Okay, so what we'd like to do

34:15.489 --> 34:18.550
I mean, I don't want to stop
you, but I think you'd like

34:18.550 --> 34:21.449
to know a general area
of where we're gonna go next.

34:21.449 --> 34:22.679
Yeah.
So we're hoping just

34:22.679 --> 34:23.679
to show you...

34:23.679 --> 34:25.840
That would be great.
I mean, we'll pinpoint it

34:25.840 --> 34:26.840
exactly,

34:26.840 --> 34:28.719
but we'll have to come back
after everything's removed

34:28.719 --> 34:30.739
and actually put a stake
in the ground.

34:30.739 --> 34:34.080
So, we'll set Steve loose. We
have all the points programmed,

34:34.080 --> 34:37.050
get him over there,
and let you know.

34:37.050 --> 34:38.909
Okay. Yeah, that'd be great,

34:38.909 --> 34:39.909
'cause then we'll know
where to put equipment.

34:39.909 --> 34:40.909
RICK:
Exactly.

34:40.909 --> 34:41.909
Okay,
we'll let Steve go to work,

34:41.909 --> 34:42.969
andand then we'll all get
aa really good idea

34:42.969 --> 34:44.889
of where we need to go.

34:44.889 --> 34:46.170
Perfect. Let's do it.

34:46.170 --> 34:47.449
It's just over here.

34:47.449 --> 34:51.949
NARRATOR: Using GPS coordinates
provided to him by the team,

34:51.949 --> 34:55.899
Steve Guptill will now mark the
location of the next dig site,

34:55.899 --> 34:59.780
designated earlier as FG5.5,

34:59.780 --> 35:04.860
located some six feet northwest
of Borehole S6.

35:04.860 --> 35:06.970
The trail of information
from S6

35:06.970 --> 35:10.520
to this location, we believe
we're rounding to something.

35:10.520 --> 35:12.570
And we may,
because of this hole,

35:12.570 --> 35:15.380
we may find the Oak Island
Treasure Company vault,

35:15.380 --> 35:16.820
i.e. the Chappell Vault.

35:16.820 --> 35:18.770
We may find the Money Pit.

35:18.770 --> 35:22.120
We're very close to
a number of things, possibly.

35:22.120 --> 35:24.310
So, it's pretty close
to the last drill.

35:24.310 --> 35:25.310
Okay.

35:25.310 --> 35:26.890
From center point,
it's only two meters off.

35:26.890 --> 35:27.570
Okay.

35:35.970 --> 35:37.490
So, right about here.

35:37.690 --> 35:39.101
VANESSA: right about there.
Okay, so the corner of this.

35:39.101 --> 35:41.530
So we're coming right up here
for... What's this one gonna

35:41.530 --> 35:45.920
be called?
RICK: you name it.

35:45.920 --> 35:48.850
me name it?
Yeah.

35:48.850 --> 35:50.310
What's your daughter's name?

35:50.310 --> 35:51.310
Gracie.

35:51.310 --> 35:54.220
Let's do GG1,

35:54.220 --> 35:58.310
because we call her GG
and my daughter's named Gracie.

35:58.310 --> 35:59.850
So how 'bout GG1?

35:59.850 --> 36:02.510
It's a lucky name.
it is. it is a lucky name.

36:02.510 --> 36:04.620
RICK: Fair enough. All Right.
All right. We'll get set up.

36:04.620 --> 36:05.910
NARRATOR:
As the team from Irving

36:05.910 --> 36:07.500
Equipment Limited breaks ground

36:07.500 --> 36:11.510
on Borehole GG1
at the Money Pit site...

36:11.510 --> 36:14.820
...brothers Marty
and Rick Lagina,

36:14.820 --> 36:16.750
their partner Craig Tester,

36:16.750 --> 36:19.070
and metal detection expert
Gary Drayton

36:19.070 --> 36:20.900
gather in the war room.

36:20.900 --> 36:22.450
They are eager to hear

36:22.450 --> 36:24.980
the results
of scientific analysis

36:24.980 --> 36:26.760
conducted on the lead artifact

36:26.760 --> 36:29.630
found three days ago on Lot 21.

36:29.630 --> 36:33.200
As you guys know,

36:33.200 --> 36:36.320
Rick sent the laser ablation
data on to Tobias,

36:36.320 --> 36:37.950
the guy who determined
where the cross

36:37.950 --> 36:39.610
was mined and when.
Yeah.

36:39.610 --> 36:41.880
So, he's gonna have some data
for us.

36:41.880 --> 36:44.700
Hopefully we get some good news.

36:44.700 --> 36:47.880
We're going to have an
information session from Tobias.

36:47.880 --> 36:50.250
He's the German scientist
that, uh,

36:50.250 --> 36:53.990
has the extensive lead mine data

36:53.990 --> 36:55.370
and analyzed the cross.

36:55.370 --> 36:58.210
Gary, can you get Tobias
on the screen, please?

36:58.210 --> 36:59.210
Yeah, sure.

36:59.210 --> 37:01.210
I'll get him up.

37:01.210 --> 37:02.220
Hello, Tobias.

37:02.220 --> 37:03.870
Hello again, everyone.

37:03.870 --> 37:06.010
RICK:
So, Tobias,

37:06.010 --> 37:07.650
we sent on the isotope values,

37:07.650 --> 37:09.550
so we're very keenly interested

37:09.550 --> 37:11.480
in what your determination
has been.

37:11.480 --> 37:13.460
Okay, so, uh, I had a look

37:13.460 --> 37:20.570
at the data
of the Lot 21 artifact, right?

37:20.570 --> 37:22.100
Correct.
Exactly.

37:22.100 --> 37:23.360
Okay, the Lot 21 artifact,

37:23.360 --> 37:25.190
well, it could be
a little bit different

37:25.190 --> 37:26.450
from your expectations.

37:26.450 --> 37:28.720
So, can I tell you
what I think?

37:28.720 --> 37:29.720
Yes, please.
Absolutely.

37:29.720 --> 37:30.720
Okay.

37:30.720 --> 37:34.711
I believe that this object
could have been once

37:34.711 --> 37:35.880
an art object.

37:35.880 --> 37:37.830
What makes you think that?

37:37.830 --> 37:39.530
In the Middle Ages,

37:39.530 --> 37:42.640
there was invented
a technique called cloisonn\.

37:42.640 --> 37:46.690
And this is a technique where

37:46.690 --> 37:50.580
the artist would first do
some netlike structure

37:50.580 --> 37:51.580
on the object...

37:51.580 --> 37:54.960
Yeah.
...and then put in

37:54.960 --> 37:55.960
a binding medium

37:55.960 --> 37:56.960
of calcite, enamel,

37:56.960 --> 37:58.950
and some pigments
to achieve some colors.

37:58.950 --> 38:01.140
And this is exactly
the assemblage

38:01.140 --> 38:04.980
of elements that we have here.

38:04.980 --> 38:06.260
Wow.
Excellent.

38:06.260 --> 38:07.260
Mm.

38:07.260 --> 38:10.160
NARRATOR:
Dating as far back as 5000 BC,

38:10.160 --> 38:13.920
cloisonn is an ancient method
for decorating metal

38:13.920 --> 38:16.680
and ceramic objects,

38:16.680 --> 38:18.320
used in everything
from fine art

38:18.320 --> 38:22.160
and jewelry to ornate weaponry.

38:22.160 --> 38:25.700
This technique involves
soldering metal wire or strips

38:25.700 --> 38:27.760
often made of gold or silver

38:27.760 --> 38:31.520
to make compartments
on the surface of an item.

38:31.520 --> 38:33.730
These compartments,
or cloisons,

38:33.730 --> 38:37.230
would be filled with a mixture
of powdered glass and minerals

38:37.230 --> 38:39.420
and then fired in a kiln,

38:39.420 --> 38:41.850
creating a smooth,
polished finish.

38:41.850 --> 38:45.360
TOBIAS:
Okay, so this piece is

38:45.360 --> 38:47.090
particularly interesting

38:47.090 --> 38:50.100
because
the lead isotope data here

38:50.100 --> 38:54.110
is identical
to those of the cross.

38:54.110 --> 38:57.500
Really?
Wow.

38:57.500 --> 39:00.710
TOBIAS:
The lead isotope data

39:00.710 --> 39:05.980
here is identical
to those of the cross.

39:05.980 --> 39:06.980
Really?
Wow.

39:06.980 --> 39:08.240
That's great.
and That means

39:08.240 --> 39:11.070
that probably both pieces

39:11.070 --> 39:13.670
come from the same ore deposit.

39:13.670 --> 39:17.340
So, it's pre15th century.

39:17.340 --> 39:18.470
Wow.

39:18.470 --> 39:20.640
This is fantastic.

39:20.640 --> 39:23.530
NARRATOR:
In the war room,

39:23.530 --> 39:25.820
geochemist Tobias Skowronek

39:25.820 --> 39:28.150
has just shared
an astonishing report

39:28.150 --> 39:31.360
with members
of the Oak Island team.

39:31.360 --> 39:33.920
He has determined
that the decorative lead piece

39:33.920 --> 39:36.280
found on Lot 21

39:36.280 --> 39:38.830
matches the lead used
to make the medieval cross

39:38.830 --> 39:42.380
discovered last year
at Smith's Cove,

39:42.380 --> 39:46.050
lead which was mined
more than 600 years ago

39:46.050 --> 39:47.800
in a region of Southern France

39:47.800 --> 39:50.810
with deep ties
to the Knights Templar.

39:50.810 --> 39:53.210
TOBIAS:
This is absolutely

39:53.210 --> 39:59.800
from the same source,
uh, as the cross is.

39:59.800 --> 40:00.800
Wow.

40:00.800 --> 40:01.800
That's huge.

40:01.800 --> 40:02.800
Yeah.

40:02.800 --> 40:03.800
That is amazing,
'cause that reminded me

40:03.800 --> 40:04.800
of the cross.

40:04.800 --> 40:06.840
MARTY:
You know, it makes sense.

40:06.840 --> 40:07.850
If people were here,

40:07.850 --> 40:09.700
they would probably have put
an impact

40:09.700 --> 40:11.600
all over the island.

40:11.600 --> 40:13.770
So it seems incredible

40:13.770 --> 40:17.910
and stretches belief, but...

40:17.910 --> 40:20.600
the lead from the cross and
the lead from this other piece

40:20.600 --> 40:24.100
were from the same ancient mine
in France.

40:24.100 --> 40:27.000
Fantastic job.
Appreciate the data.

40:27.000 --> 40:28.000
RICK: Yeah.

40:28.000 --> 40:29.570
Very much appreciate the time.
Thank you. I'm sure

40:29.570 --> 40:30.800
you'll hear from us again.
(chuckles)

40:30.800 --> 40:32.050
TOBIAS:
Thank you, guys.

40:32.050 --> 40:34.032
It was a tremendous opportunity
for me,

40:34.032 --> 40:36.430
so I hope
that the story continues.

40:36.430 --> 40:38.050
The story will continue.
Thank you.

40:38.050 --> 40:40.980
NARRATOR:
For Rick, Marty and the team,

40:40.980 --> 40:43.940
the confirmation
that two discoveries

40:43.940 --> 40:47.080
made on opposite ends
of Oak Island both date

40:47.080 --> 40:51.240
to a time and place connected
to the Knights Templar

40:51.240 --> 40:54.170
offers what could be
the greatest breakthrough yet

40:54.170 --> 40:57.780
in the 223 years old
Oak Island mystery.

40:57.780 --> 41:02.210
Could they be proof that
members of the medieval order

41:02.210 --> 41:04.080
really did visit Oak Island

41:04.080 --> 41:06.210
as early as the 14th century?
(shouting)

41:06.210 --> 41:09.040
Or might
they have been left here

41:09.040 --> 41:11.140
by their heirs during an effort

41:11.140 --> 41:14.370
to protect their most
sacred treasures and secrets

41:14.370 --> 41:16.850
for all of eternity?

41:16.850 --> 41:20.000
As the team continues
their quest

41:20.000 --> 41:22.730
to locate the legendary
Money Pit treasure vault,

41:22.730 --> 41:26.950
one thing now seems
more certain than ever.

41:26.950 --> 41:29.490
Whatever lies buried
on Oak Island

41:29.490 --> 41:31.550
could very well change

41:31.550 --> 41:36.000
the history of North America.

41:36.000 --> 41:37.600
Next time
on The Curse of Oak Island...

41:37.600 --> 41:40.150
D'ARCY O'CONNOR:
A Spanish galleon loaded

41:40.150 --> 41:41.150
with plunder

41:41.150 --> 41:43.400
got caught in a storm
and was purposefully beached

41:43.400 --> 41:44.610
on Oak Island.

41:44.610 --> 41:45.830
Oh, sweet!

41:45.830 --> 41:47.980
A really old piece of glass.

41:47.980 --> 41:49.130
They call 'em pirate bottles.

41:49.130 --> 41:50.130
See? Pirates were here.

41:50.130 --> 41:51.130
DANNY:
Yeah!

41:51.130 --> 41:52.180
That's what we're looking for!

41:52.180 --> 41:54.430
RICK:
We're on something.

41:54.430 --> 41:55.710
That is massive.

41:55.710 --> 41:58.800
Oh, look at that.
JACK: What?

41:58.800 --> 41:59.800
That's a lock.

41:59.800 --> 42:01.839
JACK: Oh, it is!
That looks like it's off

42:01.863 --> 42:03.863
A treasure chest.
