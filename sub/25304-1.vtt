03:40.185 --> 03:41.163
You're in a hurry.

03:42.400 --> 03:44.413
- Long drive, I'm excited.
- Yeah.

03:46.230 --> 03:47.063
Can I help?

03:49.103 --> 03:50.103
Take that.

03:51.930 --> 03:52.763
Don't bother.

03:57.940 --> 03:58.773
Alright.

03:59.684 --> 04:01.684
The river's right there.

04:19.103 --> 04:22.228
Is that like a fire or somethin'?

04:22.230 --> 04:26.358
They log right there,
so it's not a fire.

04:26.360 --> 04:28.323
We should have brought a boat out here.

04:29.605 --> 04:30.753
That would have been fun.

04:31.660 --> 04:32.493
Next time.

04:33.873 --> 04:35.183
Meant for pictures today.

04:38.850 --> 04:39.683
You know...

04:41.255 --> 04:43.752
Oh, go ahead, I'm not stopping you.

04:43.754 --> 04:45.004
Yeah?

04:51.015 --> 04:52.933
Glad we're here.

04:52.935 --> 04:55.102
I know, finally made it.

05:56.095 --> 05:58.178
Wait up, wait up.

06:42.960 --> 06:44.778
Have you ever been out here before?

06:44.780 --> 06:45.613
Never.

06:46.920 --> 06:48.818
Well, I think that there's
some trails over there.

06:48.820 --> 06:50.320
- Let's go see.
- Lead the way.

07:32.018 --> 07:34.461
Working on my photography lately.

07:34.463 --> 07:35.296
Mm-hm.

07:40.600 --> 07:42.278
So I've been working on my photography.

07:42.280 --> 07:45.183
You know how it's been a passion
of mine since I was little.

07:46.130 --> 07:47.130
Yeah, well, now...

07:57.693 --> 07:59.593
This looks like a good spot.

08:03.670 --> 08:05.520
Yeah, I'm a little tired, honestly.

08:09.200 --> 08:10.898
How're you feelin'?

08:10.900 --> 08:11.808
I'm a little tired, too.

08:11.810 --> 08:13.868
I can't wait to get some pictures, though.

08:13.870 --> 08:15.673
I'm really working on my portfolio.

08:19.002 --> 08:21.358
What do you have? Let me see.

08:21.360 --> 08:22.193
It's a Nikon.

08:25.170 --> 08:26.270
Did you just buy it?

08:27.312 --> 08:30.358
Kind of recently, I
upgraded from my last one.

08:30.360 --> 08:32.059
I don't know if you remember that.

08:33.289 --> 08:34.153
I really don't.

08:38.042 --> 08:39.153
That was a good shot.

08:52.980 --> 08:54.330
So, how's your boyfriend?

08:55.210 --> 08:56.866
He's good.

08:56.868 --> 08:57.701
Yeah?

09:02.718 --> 09:05.548
Is he good?

09:05.550 --> 09:07.928
Yeah, he's good.

09:07.930 --> 09:11.240
He just got a new job recently, so...

09:13.290 --> 09:14.123
I'm excited.

09:15.030 --> 09:15.863
Where at?

09:17.148 --> 09:18.998
For a construction company.

09:31.825 --> 09:33.325
Do you love him?

09:36.550 --> 09:37.973
Yeah, I think I do.

09:45.890 --> 09:47.240
Then why are we out here?

09:49.210 --> 09:52.808
Well, I was wanting to work
on my portfolio for pictures,

09:52.810 --> 09:57.170
and you wanted to talk,
so I figured we can...

09:58.920 --> 10:00.063
Go on a little hike.

10:01.910 --> 10:02.743
Well...

10:15.190 --> 10:16.540
Do you have a girlfriend?

10:18.970 --> 10:21.073
Uh, no, I don't.

10:21.930 --> 10:24.310
- No?
- Or I wouldn't be here.

10:27.582 --> 10:28.632
Does that make sense?

10:31.060 --> 10:33.423
I guess, yeah, that
makes a little sense.

10:34.530 --> 10:39.253
But I thought we were
coming out as friends.

10:41.850 --> 10:44.393
I mean, do friends have sex?

10:46.591 --> 10:48.991
Is that a thing friends
do or is that a thing...

10:51.773 --> 10:54.170
A boyfriend and girlfriend, what is that?

10:55.400 --> 10:58.368
Well, last we had sex
was a long time ago.

10:58.370 --> 10:59.470
When we were together.

11:02.330 --> 11:04.380
So, yeah, boyfriend and girlfriend thing.

11:05.942 --> 11:06.775
Well...

11:13.235 --> 11:15.720
Look at that bird.

11:17.113 --> 11:19.128
I think that was an eagle.

11:19.130 --> 11:19.963
Oh, really?

11:21.570 --> 11:22.648
Let me see.

11:22.650 --> 11:23.883
You got a picture of it?

11:27.250 --> 11:29.598
- Cool, huh?
- Yeah, it's alright.

11:29.600 --> 11:31.700
You know I don't really like pictures, so.

11:34.560 --> 11:35.860
Where are we going, again?

11:37.290 --> 11:40.578
Well, I know this area a little.

11:40.580 --> 11:43.038
There should be some trails down that way,

11:43.040 --> 11:46.968
but I would much rather
get more real shots

11:46.970 --> 11:50.053
than go down trails that
everyone else has seen.

11:52.520 --> 11:53.353
Okay.

11:55.850 --> 11:57.000
You hear that damn fly?

11:59.100 --> 11:59.933
Sorry.

12:01.210 --> 12:04.963
I saw, I saw somethin' down
there we could go check out.

12:07.553 --> 12:08.653
- If you want.
- Okay.

12:11.520 --> 12:13.088
Sorry for bringing
up the boyfriend thing,

12:13.090 --> 12:15.008
I shouldn't have brought that up.

12:15.010 --> 12:16.330
- It's okay.
- I just...

12:17.370 --> 12:19.908
- People have questions.
- Yeah.

12:19.910 --> 12:22.860
You know, I just got a little
caught up in my thoughts, so.

12:23.740 --> 12:25.998
- Should we head out that way?
- Yeah.

12:26.000 --> 12:27.458
Yeah.

12:27.460 --> 12:29.028
Alright, do you mind holding this?

12:29.030 --> 12:30.780
- Oh, yeah, for sure.
- Thank you.

12:34.217 --> 12:36.238
Alright, you lead the way.

12:36.240 --> 12:37.090
Okay, let's go.

14:03.560 --> 14:05.960
Alright, so I said I
wasn't gonna bring it up.

14:08.230 --> 14:09.063
I'm sorry.

14:10.085 --> 14:12.013
But does your boyfriend think I'm a joke?

14:13.610 --> 14:16.010
He doesn't
really know much about you.

14:19.300 --> 14:20.658
Does he take me serious?

14:20.660 --> 14:22.268
Does he know we're on a hike?

14:22.270 --> 14:24.008
Does he know we're hangin' out?

14:24.010 --> 14:25.998
I mean, he knows I have
a friend named James.

14:26.000 --> 14:28.750
I just didn't see the point
of him knowing our history.

14:29.650 --> 14:34.650
It wasn't a huge deal for me,
I thought we were friends.

14:34.660 --> 14:37.263
Wanted to come out here
for pictures and a hike.

14:38.310 --> 14:40.328
So, yes, he does know that
I'm on a hike with you,

14:40.330 --> 14:42.288
but he doesn't know our history.

14:42.290 --> 14:45.138
So, he just thinks
we're friends on a hike.

14:45.140 --> 14:46.193
He's okay with that?

14:47.290 --> 14:48.540
So, he thinks I'm a joke.

14:49.760 --> 14:51.798
I think we're just
friends on a hike, but,

14:51.800 --> 14:53.493
I wouldn't consider you a joke.

14:58.630 --> 14:59.461
Do you know how much time

14:59.463 --> 15:03.203
that I've put into this
relationship with you?

15:06.190 --> 15:07.163
Not really.

15:08.114 --> 15:10.563
Yeah, you've been too busy
takin' photos, you don't know?

15:11.674 --> 15:13.724
That was my purpose of coming out here.

15:16.130 --> 15:16.963
Years.

15:20.570 --> 15:21.413
I've wasted.

15:22.370 --> 15:23.437
You know what?

15:24.700 --> 15:27.100
I said I wasn't gonna
bring it up, let's just...

15:29.385 --> 15:30.348
Did you bring a lunch?

15:30.350 --> 15:32.978
Let's just change the
subject, let's just,

15:32.980 --> 15:35.338
- you know, let's...
- Enjoy this beautiful day?

15:35.340 --> 15:37.418
Yeah, let's...

15:37.420 --> 15:38.253
Let's do that.

15:40.900 --> 15:43.543
Boyfriend, meh.

15:43.545 --> 15:44.795
Okay, let's go.

16:15.310 --> 16:16.410
So, is he good at sex?

16:24.750 --> 16:27.163
I don't think that
that's appropriate to ask.

16:31.450 --> 16:35.158
Is he good at making love?

16:35.160 --> 16:36.108
Is that better?

16:36.110 --> 16:37.410
I'll sugarcoat it for you.

16:41.640 --> 16:42.473
Wow.

16:44.670 --> 16:46.478
Answer the question.

16:46.480 --> 16:47.693
Does he fuck you right?

16:53.310 --> 16:54.508
That's so inappropriate.

16:54.510 --> 16:57.578
You need to stop asking me this stuff.

16:57.580 --> 16:59.808
But we've had sex
before, how's it inappropriate?

16:59.810 --> 17:02.728
It's a simple question, I wanna know.

17:02.730 --> 17:04.755
- Why are you being so rude?
- How am I being rude?

17:04.757 --> 17:07.573
You need to stop, this is inappropriate.

17:08.609 --> 17:11.387
We've had sex
before, how's it inappropriate?

17:11.390 --> 17:13.018
It's inappropriate for you to ask me

17:13.020 --> 17:17.438
about my new relationship and
personal things like that.

17:17.440 --> 17:20.190
What happened between you
and me ended a long time ago.

17:23.670 --> 17:25.233
I thought we were just friends.

17:26.970 --> 17:28.220
Does he fuck you right?

17:31.180 --> 17:32.680
Answer the damn question, man.

17:34.550 --> 17:36.548
You just
absolutely need to stop.

17:36.550 --> 17:37.909
It's just a simple question, though.

17:37.911 --> 17:40.088
I mean, I don't see what's
wrong with it, animals have sex.

17:40.090 --> 17:43.008
I mean, does he fuck you good at night?

17:43.010 --> 17:44.908
When I'm sittin' at the
house thinkin' about you,

17:44.910 --> 17:46.539
is he havin' sex with you?

17:46.541 --> 17:49.478
I don't see why you can't just
answer the fuckin' question.

17:49.480 --> 17:50.980
This is fuckin' crazy, dude.

17:51.930 --> 17:53.180
You have to knock it off.

17:58.930 --> 18:01.888
Are you gonna, are you
gonna call your boyfriend?

19:12.021 --> 19:13.798
Bring a swimsuit.

19:13.800 --> 19:15.760
We could swim, we can...

19:16.811 --> 19:18.310
I don't know, what do you wanna do?

19:18.312 --> 19:19.968
There's a lot of stuff to do out here.

19:19.970 --> 19:23.070
- Like hike and take pictures?
- Like hike and take pictures.

19:24.290 --> 19:25.240
I guess that's fun.

19:27.100 --> 19:28.750
Give me a hug, that's all I want.

19:29.719 --> 19:31.004
I missed you.

19:31.006 --> 19:32.006
I missed you, too.

19:33.688 --> 19:36.685
You know they got blackberry
bushes out here, right?

19:36.687 --> 19:38.688
There's an old shack out here, too, right?

19:38.690 --> 19:40.318
Didn't you tell me about that?

19:40.320 --> 19:43.418
Yeah, I did, a while ago,
where the crazy old man lives.

19:43.420 --> 19:45.038
Yeah, let's go see
that, which way is it?

19:45.040 --> 19:47.004
I don't know if he's still
alive, that was just a legend.

19:47.006 --> 19:51.208
- I've not really seen it.
- Creep old shack, a hike.

19:51.210 --> 19:53.238
You know, it sounds fun, right?

19:53.240 --> 19:55.724
- Can have a good time.
- Yeah, let's go.

19:55.726 --> 19:57.608
♪ No matter ♪

19:57.610 --> 19:58.443
Try it.

19:59.589 --> 20:00.458
- I don't sing.
- Let's hear, I wanna hear.

20:00.460 --> 20:01.581
- I take pictures.
- From right here.

20:01.583 --> 20:02.928
I don't sing.

20:02.930 --> 20:04.368
Cheese.

20:04.370 --> 20:07.038
Cheese.

20:07.040 --> 20:08.298
- There we go.
- There.

20:08.300 --> 20:10.698
You always said I don't smile, so.

20:10.700 --> 20:12.818
The bird out here are so beautiful.

20:12.820 --> 20:15.028
- I just absolutely love it.
- Aw, I love it, too.

20:15.030 --> 20:18.248
They're great, they're
great, let's take more.

20:18.250 --> 20:20.518
Why do you always
have to be so sarcastic?

20:20.520 --> 20:22.458
- Appreciate the little things.
- I love birds, man.

20:22.460 --> 20:24.228
- Where they at?
- Look at that bird.

20:24.230 --> 20:26.088
- How perfect.
- Oh, yeah, that's so cool.

20:26.090 --> 20:27.584
Man, let me see that.

20:27.586 --> 20:28.898
- Oh, my god.
- Okay, okay.

20:28.900 --> 20:30.728
You don't have to...

20:30.730 --> 20:32.258
- You wanna take some?
- Let me take some pictures.

20:32.260 --> 20:34.793
Man, this is awesome,
this is so cool, man.

20:34.795 --> 20:36.023
Oh, my god.

20:38.220 --> 20:41.288
You're not even holding
it right, James.

20:41.290 --> 20:43.728
This is the button, here's the focus.

20:43.730 --> 20:45.530
See, there's a good one right there.

20:47.157 --> 20:47.990
Oh.

20:51.296 --> 20:53.346
You know what, Amanda, this is awesome!

20:54.380 --> 20:56.128
I could...

20:56.130 --> 20:58.523
Oh, man, I think I can do this all day.

20:59.580 --> 21:01.538
Take some more!

21:01.540 --> 21:02.371
Oh.

21:02.373 --> 21:04.618
You can make a little album from you.

21:04.620 --> 21:07.223
Oh.

21:08.847 --> 21:10.608
Oh, yeah.

21:10.610 --> 21:12.723
You know I'm just bein'
a smart-ass, right?

21:14.040 --> 21:16.645
Well, I was hoping
you'd actually be into it.

21:31.954 --> 21:33.986
- Hey!
- Oh, my goodness.

21:33.988 --> 21:36.705
That was not funny.

21:36.707 --> 21:38.866
I missed you, sorry.

21:38.868 --> 21:40.554
It's okay, I missed you, too.

21:40.556 --> 21:44.431
Alright.

21:44.433 --> 21:46.683
Are we gonna go look for...

22:16.040 --> 22:17.027
Is this locked?

22:20.060 --> 22:20.893
That's cool.

22:21.780 --> 22:23.383
- It is pretty cool.
- It's really cool.

22:25.579 --> 22:27.329
I wonder if the old man's in there.

22:30.537 --> 22:31.928
How do we get in?

22:31.930 --> 22:32.930
That's the question.

22:35.630 --> 22:37.580
You can rip it off, come on, muscles.

22:39.090 --> 22:40.683
- Rip it off?
- Let's go.

22:43.219 --> 22:44.848
Shit.

22:44.850 --> 22:46.118
Huh?

22:46.120 --> 22:47.117
Oh, I was just...

22:48.480 --> 22:49.703
That is so cool.

22:51.880 --> 22:53.933
I'm tired of carrying, alright?

22:54.970 --> 22:56.615
You can carry.

22:56.617 --> 22:58.373
Hey, get a picture of me right here, look.

23:04.899 --> 23:06.683
Oh, macho.

23:08.712 --> 23:10.838
Makes you happy, right, pictures?

23:10.840 --> 23:11.989
Oh, yeah.

23:11.991 --> 23:14.181
- You know what's gonna happen.
- Come here.

23:14.183 --> 23:15.921
- A hug?
- I know you want pictures.

23:15.923 --> 23:17.908
Does that make you happy?

23:17.910 --> 23:20.388
All these damn pictures,
birds and tractors.

23:20.390 --> 23:22.260
I mean, what do you need?

23:22.262 --> 23:24.609
You want more pictures?

23:24.611 --> 23:25.444
Okay.

23:28.819 --> 23:30.849
Take your fuckin' picture.

23:30.851 --> 23:32.268
I'm just kiddin'.

23:34.299 --> 23:36.799
Let's go see the...

23:38.540 --> 23:39.373
Yeah.

23:41.870 --> 23:44.918
What about this cabin, how are
we gonna get into this cabin?

23:44.920 --> 23:46.663
Have you figured that out yet, hm?

23:47.550 --> 23:49.633
James, stop being a freak.

23:51.240 --> 23:53.898
It's just a stick, lighten up.

23:53.900 --> 23:56.638
At least it's not a knife, right?

23:56.640 --> 23:57.863
At least it's not a knife.

24:00.840 --> 24:02.063
What're you doin' over there?

24:02.900 --> 24:05.393
You doin' anything
useful with yourself, hm?

24:07.780 --> 24:09.468
- Amanda?
- Building my future.

24:09.470 --> 24:12.858
When the last time that
you did somethin' useful,

24:12.860 --> 24:13.693
for yourself?

24:14.870 --> 24:16.993
You're being awfully rude, James.

24:25.580 --> 24:26.413
I'm waiting.

24:29.002 --> 24:30.678
Take some pictures, that's
what we're here for, right?

24:30.680 --> 24:33.697
I'm trying, but you keep
being so rude, I don't...

24:33.699 --> 24:36.638
I'll be patient,
here, look, there's so many cool

24:36.640 --> 24:39.733
things you can take
pictures of out here, okay?

24:40.979 --> 24:43.638
Then let's do it, and
quit being rude, please?

24:43.640 --> 24:46.267
How are the pictures comin' along here?

24:46.269 --> 24:47.338
They're turning out wonderful.

24:47.340 --> 24:49.587
I can't wait to edit them and publish 'em.

24:51.350 --> 24:53.808
- Reviews are gonna be great.
- Look, I can't take it.

24:53.810 --> 24:56.760
Alright, let me come clean with
you, okay, on why I'm here.

24:59.460 --> 25:00.710
Do you know why I'm here?

25:03.400 --> 25:05.288
Come along
with me to hike and...

25:05.290 --> 25:07.090
No, I'm here to get back with you.

25:10.840 --> 25:11.673
Okay?

25:13.400 --> 25:14.473
Isn't that obvious?

25:19.210 --> 25:20.653
It has to be obvious, right?

25:22.940 --> 25:25.483
I mean, I'm, you know we're good.

25:27.700 --> 25:30.060
Me and you go back so
many years, I mean...

25:31.580 --> 25:32.630
What do I have to do?

25:35.110 --> 25:36.320
What do I have to do?

25:37.490 --> 25:40.140
To take pictures and to
hang out with me, that's...

25:41.736 --> 25:43.606
That's what I thought.

25:43.608 --> 25:45.908
It's what you thought.

25:45.910 --> 25:49.830
But what you should know...

25:49.832 --> 25:51.749
Is I wanna be with you.

25:54.270 --> 25:56.728
We can never be together again.

25:56.730 --> 25:57.563
I'm sorry.

26:00.070 --> 26:01.918
I don't want to be with you ever again.

26:01.920 --> 26:06.920
What happened was a lot
of drama and stuff that

26:08.600 --> 26:11.400
I can't ever go through
again and I don't want to...

26:13.070 --> 26:14.208
Okay.

26:14.210 --> 26:16.048
You've just given me a bunch
of shit I don't wanna hear.

26:16.050 --> 26:17.498
I don't wanna hear any of that.

26:17.500 --> 26:19.255
All that should be comin'
out of your mouth is,

26:19.257 --> 26:22.120
"Hey, hey, James, I love
you, I wanna be with you.

26:22.122 --> 26:25.083
"Let's go over there and hang out.

26:26.067 --> 26:27.805
"Let's go get naked, let's go in the pool.

26:27.807 --> 26:29.268
"Let's go have a good time."

26:29.270 --> 26:32.093
But instead you just give me
this, you just give me shit.

26:34.960 --> 26:36.360
That's never gonna happen.

26:37.250 --> 26:38.083
Sorry.

26:39.500 --> 26:41.748
Never again, we were together for such

26:41.750 --> 26:44.528
a little amount of time,
lots of stuff happened.

26:44.530 --> 26:46.543
Yes, I've known you for years, but,

26:47.470 --> 26:49.778
we were together for like a week.

26:49.780 --> 26:51.108
I'll tell you what you need to do.

26:51.110 --> 26:55.918
Get a pen and paper, write
it down, are you ready?

26:55.920 --> 26:57.381
Are you ready?

26:57.383 --> 27:00.328
I don't have a pen
and paper with me, so,

27:00.330 --> 27:03.267
I think you're going a little
crazy, maybe we should just...

27:03.269 --> 27:05.248
Shut your mouth
for a few seconds, okay?

27:05.250 --> 27:07.608
I think we should continue
on with our pictures, James.

27:07.610 --> 27:08.443
Please?

27:10.909 --> 27:14.565
- Let's go.
- Would that make you happy?

27:14.567 --> 27:15.484
It would.

27:18.200 --> 27:19.033
Yes.

27:20.407 --> 27:21.240
It will.

27:28.990 --> 27:30.828
I'm not satisfied.

27:30.830 --> 27:32.880
We're not gonna leave, I'm not satisfied.

27:33.880 --> 27:35.401
Here's what's gonna happen.

27:35.403 --> 27:39.408
When we leave this hike, you're
gonna call your boyfriend,

27:39.410 --> 27:43.993
or you can do it now, and
tell him you're done, okay?

27:45.670 --> 27:47.020
It's pretty fuckin' simple.

27:47.910 --> 27:48.743
Call him.

27:53.277 --> 27:55.388
"Hey, I don't wanna be with you."

27:55.390 --> 27:56.223
What's his name?

28:01.320 --> 28:02.158
His name is Andrew.

28:02.160 --> 28:03.638
I don't give a
fuck what his name is, okay?

28:03.640 --> 28:06.818
Just call him and tell him
that, that's the first step.

28:06.820 --> 28:10.048
And then after that, me
and you, you know what?

28:10.050 --> 28:11.841
I'll take you on a nice date.

28:11.843 --> 28:14.389
I don't wanna go on a date, James.

28:14.391 --> 28:15.418
Why not?

28:15.420 --> 28:18.631
Because I'm with someone
who I'm not gonna leave.

28:18.633 --> 28:22.982
We'll go on
a nice seafood dinner.

28:22.984 --> 28:25.513
Then we can go, honeymoon.

28:26.890 --> 28:29.461
- Honeymoon?
- Yeah.

28:29.463 --> 28:34.333
We can go see a movie or,
anyways, back to the list.

28:36.840 --> 28:38.508
Back to the list.

28:38.510 --> 28:42.308
After that is done,
we're gonna get married.

28:42.310 --> 28:43.143
Write that down.

28:44.260 --> 28:45.558
I hope you're staying sober,

28:45.560 --> 28:47.403
'cause this is some crazy thoughts.

28:49.000 --> 28:51.648
I'm really happy in my
relationship right now.

28:51.650 --> 28:55.743
You're really starting to
freak me out, you need to stop.

29:02.890 --> 29:06.300
You know I'm just
fuckin' with you, right?

29:07.763 --> 29:09.930
I don't wanna be with you.

29:12.254 --> 29:13.154
I was just joking.

29:15.490 --> 29:16.938
So, I think we should just continue on,

29:16.940 --> 29:18.240
and go take some pictures.

29:24.675 --> 29:26.968
You know I'm fuckin' with you, right?

29:26.970 --> 29:28.158
The whole time.

29:28.160 --> 29:29.560
I've just been playin', I...

29:31.545 --> 29:32.378
I'm kidding.

29:34.862 --> 29:36.162
I don't wanna be with you.

29:38.610 --> 29:39.443
Alright?

29:40.340 --> 29:41.508
I'm kidding!

29:41.510 --> 29:43.593
Okay, so let's go get some pictures!

30:24.898 --> 30:26.585
How beautiful.

30:31.790 --> 30:33.343
Stand right there, let me get a picture.

30:35.090 --> 30:38.428
Smile.

30:38.430 --> 30:39.493
A real smile.

30:51.721 --> 30:56.721
That was good.

31:20.058 --> 31:21.908
Well, which way would you rather go?

31:21.910 --> 31:24.368
I think we should stay on the trail.

31:24.370 --> 31:25.378
I don't see a point in going down there.

31:25.380 --> 31:27.411
Come on, it looks
fine, let's go, come on.

31:27.413 --> 31:30.339
- It's a little remote.
- Stop being soft.

31:30.341 --> 31:31.424
Being a baby.

31:32.402 --> 31:33.485
Hold my hand.

31:34.738 --> 31:36.571
Hold my hand, come on.

31:37.692 --> 31:40.450
Come on, let's go, it'll be fine.

36:17.775 --> 36:20.258
Do you wanna take a break?

36:20.260 --> 36:22.142
- A break?
- Yeah.

36:22.144 --> 36:24.534
We've still got a long ways to go.

36:24.536 --> 36:26.086
I'm just kinda tired.

36:26.930 --> 36:29.718
- Let's just sit down for...
- You can lie down.

36:29.720 --> 36:31.181
Sit down.

36:31.183 --> 36:33.513
Just like five minutes, ten minutes.

36:33.515 --> 36:35.283
Eight minutes.

36:36.170 --> 36:37.270
However long it takes.

36:41.373 --> 36:42.897
You're always takin' pictures.

36:51.690 --> 36:52.523
Take a seat.

36:54.650 --> 36:55.843
- Okay.
- Don't be shy.

36:58.870 --> 37:01.443
All I've got is water down here.

37:04.243 --> 37:05.638
What is this?

37:05.640 --> 37:07.168
What happened?

37:07.170 --> 37:08.973
- Oh, I think a sticker bush.
- Oh.

37:11.820 --> 37:13.870
So, tell me about this future you have.

37:14.860 --> 37:17.068
What school you were talking about.

37:17.070 --> 37:18.220
To be a photographer?

37:19.210 --> 37:22.328
No, you said a marine
biologist, is that right?

37:22.330 --> 37:26.128
Oh, well, yeah, but that's
gonna be in the future.

37:26.130 --> 37:29.917
I wanna start off getting
my photography professional.

37:34.380 --> 37:35.848
Since that's what I
really have a passion for.

37:35.850 --> 37:38.698
Well, you don't go to
school for that, do you?

37:38.700 --> 37:39.563
I guess you can.

37:40.950 --> 37:42.808
Is that an artsy kinda degree?

37:42.810 --> 37:44.847
Is that theater arts, what is that?

37:44.849 --> 37:47.523
Not theater
arts, but just photography.

37:52.580 --> 37:53.413
Kinda tired.

37:57.119 --> 37:57.950
- You know?
- I'm not.

37:57.952 --> 37:59.420
We still have a long ways to go.

38:05.348 --> 38:07.705
Can you see these power lines here?

38:09.310 --> 38:13.933
I'm just gonna take a seat,
lay down, five minutes.

38:15.988 --> 38:19.493
It's actually comfortable, you know?

38:21.210 --> 38:23.053
Oh, hey, I like this.

38:25.660 --> 38:28.276
Oh, you just got somethin'
on your leg, I'm just...

38:28.278 --> 38:32.568
Somethin' there, I don't know what it was.

38:32.570 --> 38:34.020
Didn't I buy you these pants?

38:35.640 --> 38:37.790
No, you bought me a
different black pair.

38:40.180 --> 38:42.573
All these damn bugs on me here.

38:44.130 --> 38:46.313
No, just rest your head right here.

38:47.390 --> 38:48.338
I'm not too tired, it's okay.

38:48.340 --> 38:50.200
No, I mean it, come on.

38:54.049 --> 38:55.768
Why do you keep movin' away from me?

38:55.770 --> 38:57.808
Because I don't
think you should be touching me.

38:57.810 --> 38:58.643
Why?

39:01.030 --> 39:02.823
Brought you
here to take pictures.

39:06.132 --> 39:10.808
I think you just
need to live in the moment.

39:10.810 --> 39:13.148
I think you need to relax, alright?

39:13.150 --> 39:15.208
I think you're thinkin' about
your boyfriend, whatever,

39:15.210 --> 39:18.548
you know, just forget about
every, look where we're at.

39:18.550 --> 39:20.320
Just forget about everything.

39:24.420 --> 39:26.888
You know we got the same shoes on, right?

39:26.890 --> 39:29.988
Yeah, I noticed that.

39:29.990 --> 39:33.683
Did I tell you that you look good today?

39:35.330 --> 39:38.875
Yeah, you did, thank you.

39:38.877 --> 39:43.430
Did I tell you that, uh...

39:47.928 --> 39:49.977
I don't know what I was telling you.

39:52.568 --> 39:53.401
What?

39:55.836 --> 39:59.236
I think it's a little inappropriate.

39:59.238 --> 40:00.725
Just relax.

40:00.727 --> 40:01.894
It's all good.

40:08.848 --> 40:09.681
Hey.

40:15.080 --> 40:18.063
Look, isn't this nice,
like we used to do it?

40:19.320 --> 40:20.153
Right?

40:25.860 --> 40:26.693
Amanda.

40:27.790 --> 40:29.588
You're so...

40:29.590 --> 40:31.540
No, I don't wanna do any damn pictures.

40:37.000 --> 40:38.588
Amanda.

40:38.590 --> 40:40.550
You're so uptight, you're so...

40:42.539 --> 40:44.539
I don't know what's got into you lately.

40:46.990 --> 40:48.090
But you're just so...

40:49.890 --> 40:51.988
Is it the school thing, I
mean, why are you so uptight?

40:51.990 --> 40:55.178
Why can't you just relax for five minutes?

40:55.180 --> 40:56.013
Take a seat.

40:57.170 --> 40:59.335
Is that alcohol, James?

41:08.306 --> 41:10.635
What were you saying?

41:10.637 --> 41:14.825
Is that
alcohol you're drinking?

41:14.827 --> 41:17.395
I thought you told me you
were gonna stop drinking.

41:17.397 --> 41:18.783
No, this isn't alcohol.

41:21.709 --> 41:23.458
It's, it's apple juice.

41:23.460 --> 41:24.460
Go ahead and try it.

41:26.510 --> 41:27.343
That's beer.

41:29.440 --> 41:31.464
It's not beer, it's...

41:31.466 --> 41:34.998
You can't
fool me with apple juice.

41:35.000 --> 41:37.628
Look, just because your
family is full of alcoholics

41:37.630 --> 41:39.968
doesn't mean that I'm
drinking right now, alright?

41:39.970 --> 41:40.963
You need to relax.

41:41.950 --> 41:43.943
Wow, you're gonna bring up my family.

41:48.880 --> 41:50.428
Did you try it?

41:50.430 --> 41:51.585
How do you know what it
is if you didn't try it?

41:51.587 --> 41:53.913
- I can smell it.
- Just take a sip.

41:55.010 --> 41:56.358
Just try it real quick.

41:56.360 --> 41:57.657
- James, I'm not...
- Come on.

41:57.659 --> 42:00.088
Look, your family's full of alcoholics.

42:00.090 --> 42:01.592
- They're all dirt bags.
- You know I don't drink.

42:01.594 --> 42:03.266
So, just try it out.

42:03.268 --> 42:05.823
Why do you need to
bring up my family like that?

42:09.249 --> 42:11.328
You told me you were gonna stop drinking.

42:11.330 --> 42:14.748
I'm just saying your dad's
an alcoholic, so I don't see,

42:14.750 --> 42:16.383
you know, they say that, uh...

42:18.649 --> 42:20.688
That women are attracted
to people that are,

42:20.690 --> 42:22.958
to men that are like their father.

42:22.960 --> 42:24.660
Maybe that's why you like me, huh?

42:26.350 --> 42:29.208
James, I'm really
starting to not like you.

42:29.210 --> 42:31.858
You're making me regret
bringing you on this trip.

42:31.860 --> 42:34.438
I didn't know you were
gonna bring alcohol and

42:34.440 --> 42:37.503
asking me questions, very
inappropriate questions.

42:38.610 --> 42:39.773
You're freakin' me out.

42:45.480 --> 42:46.313
Look.

42:50.450 --> 42:53.265
Your father's not a
piece of shit, alright?

42:53.267 --> 42:54.100
I'm sorry.

42:56.360 --> 42:57.385
Okay, he is kind of a piece of shit.

42:57.387 --> 42:59.218
But just admit he's a
piece of shit, right?

42:59.220 --> 43:02.083
'Cause I got a lot of built
up anger towards him, so,

43:03.340 --> 43:05.283
maybe I'm holdin' onto it.

43:07.918 --> 43:09.108
Do you still talk to him?

43:09.110 --> 43:11.678
I haven't talked to him in a while, no.

43:11.680 --> 43:13.298
I don't really like to associate myself

43:13.300 --> 43:15.013
with people who rely on alcohol.

43:20.830 --> 43:22.463
I didn't think it was a big deal.

43:24.439 --> 43:27.348
A little worried about
you and your problem.

43:27.350 --> 43:29.728
Why would you bring it on a hike?

43:29.730 --> 43:30.780
You need it that bad?

43:32.580 --> 43:34.418
Why does it matter if
I'm drinkin' so much?

43:34.420 --> 43:36.988
I mean, your family's
full of fucking shit bags.

43:36.990 --> 43:39.788
Your boyfriend's a shit bag,
he drinks every god damn day.

43:39.790 --> 43:41.658
Why does it matter if I'm drinking?

43:41.660 --> 43:43.773
We're not together, are we?

43:44.610 --> 43:46.808
If you say that you'll be
with me, I'll put this down.

43:46.810 --> 43:48.210
Right now, I'll dump it out.

43:51.140 --> 43:53.408
Why does it fuckin'
matter, why does it matter

43:53.410 --> 43:56.128
if I'm drinking if we're not together?

43:56.130 --> 43:56.963
Tell me.

43:57.920 --> 43:58.753
Amanda.

43:59.660 --> 44:01.128
Say it.

44:01.130 --> 44:02.938
I guess I just don't.

44:02.940 --> 44:05.500
I was just trying to help you, but...

44:07.080 --> 44:08.603
Honestly, I don't really care.

44:10.370 --> 44:12.008
Drinking.

44:12.010 --> 44:12.843
It's great.

44:14.320 --> 44:15.463
My one true love.

44:18.170 --> 44:19.678
You know what?

44:19.680 --> 44:20.513
Fuck you.

44:21.751 --> 44:23.568
How does that sound?

44:23.570 --> 44:25.868
This is so silly, can we stop?

44:25.870 --> 44:27.997
Come on, get up, let's go.

44:29.631 --> 44:30.519
You know what?

44:30.521 --> 44:33.497
I feel free out here, I don't
wanna get up right now, okay?

44:37.860 --> 44:39.360
Okay, I'll get up.

44:41.492 --> 44:42.959
No, pull me up.

44:42.961 --> 44:44.723
I mean, what are you doin', pull me up.

44:46.520 --> 44:48.588
Sittin' there lookin' stupid,
you know I'm tryin' to get up,

44:48.590 --> 44:51.123
just pull me up, what's so hard about it?

44:54.410 --> 44:57.198
I think you're a little
unsteady right now.

44:57.200 --> 45:00.938
We should just put the alcohol
away and keep on with our

45:00.940 --> 45:01.790
photography hike.

45:05.240 --> 45:07.090
It's interesting that you say that.

45:10.510 --> 45:11.343
But I love it.

45:13.410 --> 45:14.243
I love it.

45:15.180 --> 45:18.248
If you want some, it'll
be right here, alright?

45:18.250 --> 45:20.028
It'll be right here.

45:20.030 --> 45:20.863
I'll pass.

45:23.451 --> 45:24.282
Of course you'll pass.

45:24.284 --> 45:26.458
You'll pass on every damn
thing in your life, huh?

45:26.460 --> 45:30.758
A good man, a relationship, kids.

45:30.760 --> 45:32.108
A career.

45:32.110 --> 45:35.369
I mean, you can barely keep a
hold of your damn self, right?

46:21.587 --> 46:23.326
That's my problem is you're
never fuckin' listening

46:23.328 --> 46:26.158
to what I'm saying to you,
you don't listen for one bit.

46:26.160 --> 46:28.305
You're too caught up in
your boyfriend, you're not...

46:29.180 --> 46:30.608
Stop taking pictures for a second, okay?

46:30.610 --> 46:33.298
Okay, but I think I got a
really good one right here.

46:33.300 --> 46:35.778
No, I'm tired of the fucking camera.

46:35.780 --> 46:39.293
I'm gonna throw that in the
woods in a second, okay?

46:40.550 --> 46:42.815
- What if I yanked it out?
- Okay, James.

46:42.817 --> 46:45.170
- You need to calm down.
- Oh, I'm calm.

46:46.273 --> 46:48.483
- Okay, let go.
- No, listen.

46:49.410 --> 46:50.778
Go that way.

46:50.780 --> 46:53.280
Go that way, stop playing
with me and go that way.

46:55.750 --> 46:56.583
Go.

46:57.587 --> 46:59.087
Sit the fuck down.

47:02.696 --> 47:03.863
Okay, James.

47:04.797 --> 47:05.913
You want some water?

47:07.530 --> 47:10.638
You're always running
your fuckin' mouth, man.

47:10.640 --> 47:12.290
What's funny, is somethin' funny?

47:13.410 --> 47:14.260
Are you laughin'?

47:20.560 --> 47:21.393
Here.

47:22.640 --> 47:24.008
Take some.

47:24.010 --> 47:25.093
Drink it, drink it.

47:48.690 --> 47:50.090
What are you doing, James?

47:54.535 --> 47:57.452
You know, that's a good question.

48:03.210 --> 48:04.173
What am I doing?

48:05.640 --> 48:06.473
What am I doing?

48:08.630 --> 48:10.933
Right now, or with my life?

48:13.360 --> 48:15.558
Like why are we doing
this, we're supposed to be...

48:15.560 --> 48:17.460
You ask yourself that, Amanda.

48:18.460 --> 48:21.113
Why do you think I just
brought you out here?

48:23.210 --> 48:25.760
Did you think it was to go
on a fuckin' hike and...

48:27.980 --> 48:30.573
Take pictures of birds?

48:32.845 --> 48:34.418
And bugs.

48:34.420 --> 48:35.928
And leafs.

48:35.930 --> 48:36.873
And tractors.

48:39.438 --> 48:41.924
And whatever the fuck you
want to take pictures of.

48:41.926 --> 48:44.935
What is that, did you hear that?

48:44.937 --> 48:47.037
What is that, wildlife expert, what is it?

48:50.337 --> 48:52.468
I think it's all in your head, James.

48:52.470 --> 48:56.423
I think we need to just
keep going on our way.

48:58.230 --> 49:00.433
No, I don't think we can continue.

49:04.700 --> 49:06.968
- What do you mean?
- Without figuring this out.

49:06.970 --> 49:08.163
The reason I came here.

49:10.420 --> 49:12.000
I'm not gonna leave until...

49:16.030 --> 49:18.633
Until you give me the answers that I need.

49:25.085 --> 49:28.688
I'm not sure what that means.

49:28.690 --> 49:31.590
Well, how many times do I
have to break it down for you?

49:33.020 --> 49:36.093
I've explained to you so many times.

49:39.686 --> 49:40.769
What is that?

49:43.274 --> 49:46.308
Was that a wolf, do you hear that?

49:46.310 --> 49:49.128
It's, there's nothing, James.

49:49.130 --> 49:50.273
There's really nothing.

49:55.155 --> 49:58.988
Well, I keep breaking
it down for you, okay?

50:00.700 --> 50:03.840
What do you want from
this trip we're on, huh?

50:08.143 --> 50:09.693
It's so quiet out here.

50:11.297 --> 50:13.953
You know, you can't hear anything.

50:19.110 --> 50:20.253
Besides silence.

50:23.740 --> 50:25.193
Everything's just so quiet.

50:30.100 --> 50:32.700
So, if you screamed, do you
think anyone would hear?

50:35.660 --> 50:37.363
Do you think anyone would hear that?

50:38.570 --> 50:41.743
That's a silly question.

50:44.150 --> 50:45.100
How was it silly?

50:48.610 --> 50:50.333
Death happens out here.

50:54.900 --> 50:56.208
Every day.

50:56.210 --> 50:58.278
It's part of life,
death is a part of life.

50:58.280 --> 50:59.843
Suffering is a part of life.

51:05.025 --> 51:08.358
Do you wanna suffer, like I've suffered?

51:11.100 --> 51:12.478
Of course not.

51:12.480 --> 51:15.013
Well, then why do I have
to suffer and you don't?

51:17.250 --> 51:18.083
Hm?

51:18.980 --> 51:20.730
I didn't know you were suffering.

51:26.750 --> 51:27.583
Well, I am.

51:28.850 --> 51:30.130
I've suffered for...

51:31.870 --> 51:32.853
Two years.

51:35.360 --> 51:36.660
I've wasted time with you.

51:38.638 --> 51:42.277
I didn't even talk to you
for a year and a half of that.

51:48.260 --> 51:51.110
You know what it's like to
think about someone all day?

51:52.400 --> 51:55.183
And fantasize over someone
all day that you can't have?

51:57.540 --> 51:58.990
Do you know what that's like?

52:01.760 --> 52:05.563
Do you know what it's
like to be by yourself?

52:10.580 --> 52:14.423
In a room, with no friends.

52:16.210 --> 52:17.490
Thinking about...

52:20.230 --> 52:21.663
That person you love,

52:24.150 --> 52:26.650
loving someone else, do
you know what that's like?

52:29.440 --> 52:30.490
I don't think you do.

52:33.340 --> 52:35.653
That's suffering, that's pain.

52:37.590 --> 52:39.818
Are you listening to
what I'm saying to you?

52:39.820 --> 52:41.358
Am I making sense?

52:41.360 --> 52:42.598
Are you picking it up?

52:42.600 --> 52:44.550
Do I have to keep fuckin' repeatin' it?

52:46.020 --> 52:46.853
Huh?

52:48.110 --> 52:48.943
Listen.

52:51.300 --> 52:52.133
Wake up.

52:57.620 --> 52:59.323
Where's your fuckin' camera?

53:12.457 --> 53:14.393
- Can we please just go?
- Shut up.

53:15.460 --> 53:16.293
For a second.

53:17.330 --> 53:19.378
Where are we gonna go from here?

53:19.380 --> 53:20.883
Do you hear that fuckin' bird?

53:23.270 --> 53:26.653
Yeah, it's beautiful.

53:35.470 --> 53:36.301
- Please let go.
- Do you see that?

53:36.303 --> 53:38.030
Do you see that ditch right over there?

53:49.538 --> 53:52.955
Do you wanna go in that ditch over there?

53:56.490 --> 53:57.988
No, James, I don't.

53:57.990 --> 53:59.148
- Just let go.
- What are you gonna do?

53:59.150 --> 54:00.843
You gonna call your boyfriend on me?

54:03.140 --> 54:03.973
Hm?

54:07.540 --> 54:09.890
- I can report it to the...
- Shut the fuck up.

54:10.910 --> 54:11.743
For one...

54:13.590 --> 54:14.890
Give me this camera, okay?

54:16.010 --> 54:17.228
I'm gonna throw it pretty soon,

54:17.230 --> 54:18.980
if you don't start listening to me.

54:19.940 --> 54:23.348
How much did you pay for that?

54:23.350 --> 54:25.191
You sure you don't want some of this?

54:25.193 --> 54:26.026
I don't drink.

54:31.000 --> 54:33.150
I don't remember
asking you if you drink.

54:37.070 --> 54:41.218
I didn't say, "hey, hey,
do you drink alcohol?"

54:41.220 --> 54:42.103
Did I say that?

54:43.890 --> 54:45.953
No, I asked you if you wanted a drink.

54:48.470 --> 54:49.620
- Here.
- No, thank you.

54:56.081 --> 54:57.171
Fine.

54:57.173 --> 54:59.698
How about we, let's do
somethin' you wanna do, alright?

54:59.700 --> 55:00.650
Let's change it up.

55:02.419 --> 55:04.973
Let's grab this fuckin' thing.

55:06.260 --> 55:08.483
This goofy thing, here,
you want some pictures?

55:09.670 --> 55:10.720
How about we do that?

55:14.070 --> 55:15.318
What's wrong with you?

55:15.320 --> 55:16.831
Am I scaring you?

55:16.833 --> 55:17.666
A little bit.

55:20.730 --> 55:21.593
Well, too bad.

55:23.520 --> 55:26.370
Just get comfortable, get real
nice and comfortable here.

55:27.340 --> 55:29.623
Alright, we're gonna take
a good picture of you.

55:31.382 --> 55:32.803
Look at me.

55:34.970 --> 55:36.228
Do you think I'm gonna
take a fuckin' picture

55:36.230 --> 55:38.317
of the back of your
head, what're you doin'?

55:39.630 --> 55:41.573
Well, what do you want me to do, James?

55:43.473 --> 55:45.123
Hit you in your god damn mouth.

55:49.254 --> 55:51.208
There you go.

55:51.210 --> 55:52.043
Smile.

55:54.042 --> 55:55.142
Smile.

55:57.770 --> 55:58.603
With your teeth.

56:04.320 --> 56:05.153
There you go.

56:06.406 --> 56:08.123
Smile like you love me.

56:11.980 --> 56:13.580
Smile like you wanna be with me.

56:15.635 --> 56:18.328
Now look angry.

56:32.460 --> 56:33.293
James.

56:38.193 --> 56:41.260
What if I did this?

56:41.262 --> 56:42.628
Does that feel good?

56:42.630 --> 56:43.768
- No.
- Right there.

56:43.770 --> 56:45.558
- No.
- No?

56:45.560 --> 56:46.675
- No, it doesn't.
- Don't push away from me.

56:46.677 --> 56:49.027
How about I pull your
hair out, how about that?

56:50.890 --> 56:52.598
James, please stop.

56:52.600 --> 56:53.433
James!

56:54.350 --> 56:57.140
- Stop, please.
- I'm not gonna stop.

56:58.753 --> 57:00.336
How does that feel?

57:02.004 --> 57:03.704
- Come here.
- James, stop, please.

57:05.860 --> 57:07.303
James, stop, please.

57:09.990 --> 57:11.240
How does that feel, hm?

57:12.560 --> 57:14.360
- You're scaring me, James.
- Am I?

57:16.814 --> 57:19.397
What if I continued to do this?

57:21.073 --> 57:24.082
What're you gonna do, you
gonna call your boyfriend?

01:10:10.982 --> 01:10:15.982
