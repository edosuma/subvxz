WEBVTT

00:06.106 --> 00:09.442
I WANT TO SEE MY WIFE,
AS I USED TO BE,

00:09.509 --> 00:10.977
A MAN.

00:11.044 --> 00:12.946
IF THIS INFORMATION
IS WHAT YOU SAY IT IS,

00:13.012 --> 00:14.714
WYNN WILL GO AWAY.

00:14.781 --> 00:15.982
WHAT'S
GOING ON ?

00:16.049 --> 00:17.450
WYNN HAS PEOPLE
EVERYWHERE.

00:17.517 --> 00:19.018
( Terry )
WHEN HE REALIZES
I WAS THE ONE

00:19.085 --> 00:20.453
WHO DROPPED
THE DIME ON HIM,

00:20.520 --> 00:21.521
HE'LL COME
AFTER ME.

00:21.588 --> 00:23.156
TERRY, WAIT.

00:23.223 --> 00:25.225
( Cogliostro )
YOU COME BACK FROM HELL
TO RECLAIM YOUR WIFE

00:25.291 --> 00:27.360
AND YOU MAKE
LOVE TO HER

00:27.427 --> 00:29.529
IN THE BODY
OF ANOTHER MAN ?

00:29.596 --> 00:32.232
( clown )
HEY, WYNN, YOU'RE
A FREE AGENT NOW.

00:32.298 --> 00:35.802
YOU JUST BECAME
THE MOST DANGEROUS MAN

00:35.869 --> 00:39.239
ON EARTH.

00:40.974 --> 00:43.443
THIS IS YOUR CHANCE,
BOUNTY HUNTER.

00:43.510 --> 00:46.579
I WANT YOU TO BE STRONG
WHEN I COME BACK FOR YOU.

00:46.646 --> 00:47.914
( Al )
MAJOR FORSBERG, SIR.

00:50.717 --> 00:53.052
DON'T GIVE IN
TO THE DEMONS.

00:53.119 --> 00:55.522
( Spawn )
FORSBERG...

00:55.588 --> 00:57.924
I TRUSTED HIM,
HE WAS A ROCK.

00:57.991 --> 00:59.359
NOT ANYMORE.

00:59.426 --> 01:02.395
DON'T LET
THE DEMONS TAKE YOU...

01:04.097 --> 01:06.666
MAJOR, I'VE
COME FOR YOU.

01:06.733 --> 01:09.502
Captions made possible by
HOME BOX OFFICE

01:09.569 --> 01:12.372
A DIVISION OF TIME WARNER
ENTERTAINMENT COMPANY, L.P.

01:40.934 --> 01:42.535
NO !

01:53.179 --> 01:54.547
AHHH !

02:12.632 --> 02:15.068
WHAT IF YOU CAME ACROSS
A SHELF FULL OF MASKS

02:15.134 --> 02:17.237
IN THE BASEMENT
OF SOME OLD MUSEUM ?

02:17.303 --> 02:20.240
WHAT IF YOU PICKED OUT
ONE AMONGST THE MANY,

02:20.306 --> 02:23.309
AND IT COULD GIVE YOU
ANYTHING THAT YOU

02:23.376 --> 02:26.012
EVER WISHED FOR ?

02:26.446 --> 02:29.749
IF THERE ARE CONSEQUENCES,
WOULD IT EVEN MATTER ?

02:29.816 --> 02:31.951
WHAT IF IT WAS
THIS ONE ?

02:32.018 --> 02:33.520
WOULD YOU
PUT IT ON ?

02:33.586 --> 02:35.088
OH, I FORGOT
TO MENTION,

02:35.154 --> 02:37.257
IT FEEDS OFF
YOUR DARKEST THOUGHTS.

02:37.323 --> 02:39.259
SO, IF YOU
DID PUT IT ON,

02:39.325 --> 02:41.794
WHAT WOULD YOU
WISH FOR ?

03:24.170 --> 03:25.705
OVER THERE !

03:30.944 --> 03:33.146
HEY, WHAT ABOUT
MY MONEY ?

03:43.556 --> 03:45.558
YANKEE, PIG.

03:55.101 --> 03:56.402
( chanting )

04:41.280 --> 04:43.883
WYNN SENT YOU.

04:43.950 --> 04:45.885
HE ALWAYS
SENDS SOMEONE.

04:45.952 --> 04:48.321
YOU KNEW
THAT, MAJOR.

04:48.388 --> 04:51.391
DID YOU COME ALL THIS
WAY TO KILL ME, AL ?

04:51.457 --> 04:54.394
MY ORDERS ARE,
ALIVE, IF POSSIBLE,

04:54.460 --> 04:56.863
DEAD IF NECESSARY.

04:56.929 --> 04:59.766
I FIGURED YOUR CHANCE OF
SURVIVAL WAS BETTER WITH ME.

04:59.832 --> 05:02.669
WE WON'T GET AS
FAR AS THE RIVER.

05:02.735 --> 05:05.038
THEY'RE WAITING
FOR YOU.

05:05.104 --> 05:06.706
I LIKE
A GOOD FIGHT.

05:06.773 --> 05:10.476
I'VE FOUND PEACE HERE,
IN THIS TEMPLE.

05:10.543 --> 05:14.280
I HELP THESE PEOPLE PROTECT
THEIR ANCIENT RELICS

05:14.347 --> 05:16.916
FROM THOSE WHO
WOULD TAKE THEM.

05:18.718 --> 05:21.754
I DON'T GIVE A SHIT
ABOUT YOUR TRINKETS.

05:21.821 --> 05:23.923
IT'S TIME TO GO HOME,
FORSBERG.

05:36.936 --> 05:38.705
HE'S GETTING
TOO CLOSE.

05:57.090 --> 06:00.593
NO, HE'S BROKEN
THE CIRCLE.

06:02.128 --> 06:04.497
WAIT, DON'T SHOOT !

06:12.739 --> 06:14.474
( weeping )

06:22.448 --> 06:26.519
WHAT HAVE
YOU BECOME ?

06:26.586 --> 06:28.054
NO !

06:36.996 --> 06:39.832
( Cogliostro )
FRAGMENTS OF
THE HELL SPAWN'S PAST

06:39.899 --> 06:41.768
STILL HAUNT HIM.

06:41.834 --> 06:44.370
HE CANNOT ESCAPE
HIS PAST LIFE,

06:44.437 --> 06:46.706
EVEN IN DEATH.

06:46.773 --> 06:50.309
HE MUST MAKE THE WRONG
THINGS RIGHT AGAIN.

06:54.747 --> 06:58.151
YOU'RE FINDING OUT
WHAT KIND OF MAN YOU WERE.

06:58.217 --> 07:01.254
WHY DO I EVEN BOTHER
WITH YOU, OLD MAN ?

07:01.320 --> 07:05.591
BECAUSE SOME PART OF YOU
SEEKS THE TRUTH.

07:05.658 --> 07:07.260
THERE WAS A MAN.

07:07.326 --> 07:11.297
FORSBERG,
HE TRUSTED M

07:11.364 --> 07:14.600
I BROUGHT HIM BACK
TO JASON WYNN.

07:14.667 --> 07:16.068
YOU BETRAYED HIM.

07:16.135 --> 07:17.370
I HAD ORDERS !

07:18.571 --> 07:21.440
YOU KNEW WHAT
MAJOR FORSBERG'S
FATE WOULD BE

07:21.507 --> 07:23.242
AT THE HANDS
OF WYNN.

07:23.309 --> 07:24.343
I DIDN'T KNOW.

07:24.410 --> 07:25.812
YOU KNEW.

07:25.878 --> 07:27.880
FORSBERG WAS THROWN
IN A HOLE,

07:27.947 --> 07:29.715
BEATEN
AND LEFT TO DIE.

07:29.782 --> 07:33.419
HE HAS THE ANSWERS YOU SEEK
IF HE'S STILL ALIVE.

07:35.855 --> 07:37.790
( rambling )
I MUST FINISH THE CIRCLE.

07:37.857 --> 07:39.592
THE CIRCLE
WILL PROTECT ME.

07:39.659 --> 07:41.160
IF I FINISH
THE CIRCLE,

07:41.227 --> 07:43.396
THE CIRCLE
WILL PROTECT ME.

07:43.462 --> 07:45.631
I AM PREPARED
TO DIE NOW.

07:45.698 --> 07:47.934
IF I FINISH
THE CIRCLE,

07:48.000 --> 07:50.636
THE CIRCLE
WILL PROTECT ME.

07:54.407 --> 07:56.642
OH, GOD...

08:12.291 --> 08:15.094
ALL I HAVE LEFT,
I OFFER TO YOU.

08:15.161 --> 08:17.864
I AM PREPARED
TO DIE.

08:23.769 --> 08:26.873
DO YOU REMEMBER
GIVING ME THIS PICTURE,

08:26.939 --> 08:28.374
YEARS AGO ?

08:29.609 --> 08:31.677
BEFORE YOU
BETRAYED ME.

08:31.744 --> 08:34.280
YOU TOLD ME ABOUT
WHAT YOU HAD FOUND.

08:34.347 --> 08:36.549
THE WAR MASK
OF GENGHIS KHAN.

08:36.616 --> 08:39.285
YOU TOLD ME THAT WHOEVER
PUT HIS WAR MASK ON,

08:39.352 --> 08:41.354
WOULD POSSESS
HIS POWERS.

08:41.420 --> 08:43.356
THE POWERS
GIVEN BY HELL.

08:43.422 --> 08:46.492
I THOUGHT
THOSE MISSIONS
IN THE JUNGLES

08:46.559 --> 08:47.960
HAD MADE YOU CRAZY.

08:48.027 --> 08:49.595
BUT, I AM
A BELIEVER NOW.

08:49.662 --> 08:52.865
YOU DON'T BELIEVE
IN ANYTHING.

08:53.933 --> 08:56.502
I BELIEVE IN POWER.

08:56.569 --> 09:00.106
THERE'S A CREATURE,
IT STORMED THE NSC BUILDING.

09:00.172 --> 09:02.675
IT COULD HAVE
KILLED ME.

09:04.110 --> 09:05.678
HE WAS FROM
HELL, TOO.

09:05.745 --> 09:07.680
I'M ALREADY DEAD.

09:07.747 --> 09:11.317
YOU THINK YOU CAN TAKE
THE POWER OF THE MASK ?

09:11.384 --> 09:14.587
IT WILL DESTROY YOU.

09:16.188 --> 09:19.225
I'VE BEEN BY TO SEE
THE WIFE AND KID, MAJOR.

09:19.292 --> 09:22.895
SOME MEMENTOS...
HAVE A LOOK.

09:27.133 --> 09:29.702
WHERE DID YOU
GET THIS ?

09:29.769 --> 09:31.804
I KNOW THIS TOY.

09:31.871 --> 09:34.240
IT BELONGED
TO MY BOY.

09:39.278 --> 09:41.814
OH, MY DARLING,

09:41.881 --> 09:44.784
I CAN SMELL
YOUR PERFUME.

09:52.725 --> 09:54.627
I MISS YOU SO MUCH.

09:54.694 --> 09:56.796
I'M MOVED
BY YOUR TEARS.

09:56.862 --> 09:58.831
I'LL SPARE THEIR
LIVES FOR NOW.

09:58.898 --> 10:00.733
I WILL HAVE
THE MASK.

10:00.800 --> 10:01.968
NO !

10:02.034 --> 10:05.071
GIVE ME A NAME
OR I'LL KILL THEM.

10:06.605 --> 10:08.641
ZHANG LAO.

10:13.379 --> 10:15.881
THEY ARE INNOCENT...

10:17.283 --> 10:19.585
... THEY ARE
INNOCENT...

10:20.853 --> 10:22.855
... THEY ARE INNOCENT.

10:42.308 --> 10:44.543
( loud chatter )

10:51.550 --> 10:54.053
GEN SOON,
HOW ARE YOU ?

11:08.734 --> 11:11.303
WE HAVE WAITED
A LONG TIME FOR THIS DAY.

11:11.370 --> 11:14.874
WITH THE TRIAD
AS YOUR PARTNER,

11:14.940 --> 11:17.410
YOU WILL
BE WEALTHY.

11:17.476 --> 11:19.512
I ASSUME YOU GOT
ALL OUR CASH

11:19.578 --> 11:21.347
OUT OF
HONG KONG.

11:21.414 --> 11:22.715
YES,

11:22.782 --> 11:28.254
NO ONE QUESTIONS PLANES
THAT SAYS "U.S. AIR FORCE".

11:29.922 --> 11:34.360
747s FILLED WITH
ONE HUNDRED DOLLAR BILLS.

11:35.394 --> 11:37.163
A BEAUTIFUL SIGHT.

11:37.229 --> 11:39.465
I KNOW THINGS HAVE
BEEN ROUGH FOR YOU

11:39.532 --> 11:42.501
SINCE HONG KONG WENT
BACK TO OUR CHINESE FRIENDS.

11:42.568 --> 11:45.971
YES, THE CHINESE
PAY ATTENTION.

11:46.038 --> 11:47.840
THE BRITISH DIDN'T.

11:47.907 --> 11:50.543
I'VE LOST
HONG KONG.

11:50.609 --> 11:53.045
MAYBE NOT.

11:53.112 --> 11:55.081
WHAT THE CHINESE
WANT MOST

11:55.147 --> 11:57.450
IS ACCESS TO
U.S. MILITARY
TECHNOLOGY.

11:57.516 --> 12:00.753
THAT HAS ALWAYS
BEEN IMPOSSIBLE.

12:00.820 --> 12:02.621
NOT ANYMORE.

12:02.688 --> 12:04.390
AT EVERY LEVEL
OF GOVERNMENT

12:04.457 --> 12:07.326
I'VE PLACED PEOPLE
WHO WILL BE USEFUL TO ME.

12:07.393 --> 12:09.261
NOTHING IS
IMPOSSIBLE.

12:09.328 --> 12:11.764
YOU GIVE
CHINA ACCESS,

12:11.831 --> 12:13.499
THEY'LL GIVE YOU
BACK HONG KONG.

12:14.800 --> 12:17.303
BUT THERE IS
SOMETHING ELSE I WANT.

12:17.369 --> 12:20.439
IT'S HERE
IN CHINATOWN.

12:20.506 --> 12:23.042
YOU'LL HAVE
MY BEST MEN.

12:23.109 --> 12:25.845
WHEREVER, WHENEVER.

12:25.911 --> 12:29.515
A MASK, A RELIC
FROM THE TIME OF KHAN.

12:29.582 --> 12:32.184
A MAN NAMED
ZHANG LAO HAS IT.

12:32.251 --> 12:34.620
I CANNOT HELP
YOU WITH HIM.

12:34.687 --> 12:37.490
THIS ZHANG LAO
YOU SPEAK OF,

12:37.556 --> 12:40.993
HE IS NO
ORDINARY MAN.

12:41.060 --> 12:43.829
HE IS A WITCH.

12:43.896 --> 12:47.433
GEN SOON,
YOU SURPRISE ME.

12:47.500 --> 12:49.935
A HARVARD
BUSINESSMAN.

12:50.002 --> 12:53.038
YOU SOUND AS SUPERSTITIOUS
AS THE OLD TONG WARLORDS.

12:53.105 --> 12:55.941
AND LOOK HOW
FAR THEY FELL.

12:56.008 --> 12:57.676
YOU HAVE THEM
CHASING THE DRAGON

12:57.743 --> 12:59.945
IN YOUR OPIUM DEN
DOWNSTAIRS.

13:15.261 --> 13:17.630
( chatter )

13:20.466 --> 13:23.569
IT HAS BEEN
A LONG TIME.

13:23.636 --> 13:27.373
I'M TOLD THAT I STILL
HAVE A PRICE ON MY HEAD.

13:27.439 --> 13:29.742
WHY DO THEY BOTHER WITH
AN OLD MAN LIKE ME ?

13:29.808 --> 13:33.679
YOU'RE LIFE HAS BEEN
SPARED THIS LONG.

13:35.014 --> 13:37.449
THERE IS
A REASON FOR THAT.

13:37.516 --> 13:41.287
BUT YOU DID NOT
COME HERE FOR YOURSELF.

13:41.353 --> 13:43.689
YES, THE HELL SPAWN,

13:43.756 --> 13:45.758
I WANT YOU TO
SPARE HIS LIFE.

13:45.824 --> 13:48.427
HELL SPAWN MUST
BE DESTROYED.

13:48.494 --> 13:53.032
THE ARMY OF LIGHT
DEMANDS THAT.

13:53.098 --> 13:55.534
I CAN SAVE
THIS ONE.

13:55.601 --> 13:57.736
YOU'VE FAILED WITH
ALL THE OTHERS.

13:57.803 --> 14:00.472
THAT IS WHY
THE BOUNTY HUNTERS
KILL THEM !

14:00.539 --> 14:06.145
I KNEW THIS HELL SPAWN
THAT YOU SPEAK OF,

14:06.212 --> 14:09.148
WHEN HE WAS HUMAN.

14:09.215 --> 14:13.252
HELL HAS
CHOSEN WELL.

14:13.319 --> 14:16.655
YEAH, THEY
ALWAYS DO.

14:16.722 --> 14:18.757
IT'S TOO LATE
FOR HIM.

14:18.824 --> 14:22.795
THE PROPHECY HAS
ALREADY BEEN FULFILLED.

14:22.861 --> 14:27.066
THE SEED OF A HELL SPAWN
HAS BEEN PLANTED.

14:27.132 --> 14:28.467
I'VE FAILED.

14:32.838 --> 14:34.707
THERE IS A WOMAN.

14:34.773 --> 14:37.443
SHE WAS THE WIFE
OF THE HELL SPAWN.

14:37.509 --> 14:40.679
SHE CARRIES
HIS SEED.

14:45.651 --> 14:46.719
( groaning )

14:49.188 --> 14:50.889
( telephone )

14:50.956 --> 14:52.057
YEAH.

14:52.124 --> 14:53.158
WANDA, IT'S ME.

14:53.225 --> 14:54.126
WHERE ARE YOU ?

14:54.193 --> 14:56.462
I'M IN CHINATOWN.

14:58.197 --> 14:59.798
I found Wynn.

14:59.865 --> 15:01.967
I need to
finish this.

15:02.034 --> 15:03.202
DON'T DO THIS !

15:03.269 --> 15:05.871
IT'S THE ONLY WAY TO
KEEP YOU AND CYAN SAFE.

15:05.938 --> 15:07.006
TERRY !

15:08.007 --> 15:09.475
Terry ?

15:09.541 --> 15:11.744
I love you,
Wanda.

15:13.779 --> 15:15.714
( Cyan )
DAD !

15:20.386 --> 15:22.588
IT'S OKAY,
SWEET GIRL.

15:24.456 --> 15:26.158
MAMA'S HERE.

15:26.225 --> 15:28.460
I WANT DADDY,
WHERE'S MY DADDY ?

15:28.527 --> 15:30.829
SHHH, IT'S OKAY, BABY.

15:30.896 --> 15:31.897
DAD !

15:31.964 --> 15:33.666
NO, HONEY,
NO, NO, SHHHH.

15:33.732 --> 15:35.801
MAMA'S HERE.

15:35.868 --> 15:38.437
HE HAD TO GO
AWAY ON A TRIP.

15:38.504 --> 15:40.339
HE'LL BE BACK.

15:40.406 --> 15:42.675
HE'S TAKING
TOO LONG.

15:42.741 --> 15:45.077
MAYBE DADDY GOT LOST.

15:46.779 --> 15:48.580
THEN I'LL
FIND HIM, BABY.

15:48.647 --> 15:50.683
I'LL FIND HIM.

15:58.557 --> 16:03.062
JADE, YOUR HEART
IS TROUBLED.

16:03.128 --> 16:06.365
YOU HAVEN'T KILLED
THE HELL SPAWN YET.

16:06.432 --> 16:08.000
WHY ?

16:08.067 --> 16:11.136
THERE IS AN ART
TO THE HUNT.

16:11.203 --> 16:15.441
YOU WANT ART ?
LOP OFF HIS HEAD !

16:15.507 --> 16:17.943
YOU CAN HANG IT
ON THE WALL.

16:19.411 --> 16:23.949
BUT THINGS HAVE BECOME
SO STRANGE LATELY.

16:25.751 --> 16:27.419
GOOD AND EVIL.

16:27.486 --> 16:29.988
THEY ARE LIKE
TWO SHADOWS CAST TOGETHER

16:30.055 --> 16:31.790
ON THE SAME WALL.

16:31.857 --> 16:35.728
JADE, MAYBE I SHOULD
SEND ANOTHER HUNTER.

16:35.794 --> 16:37.229

TO POSSESS
THE WAR MASK.

21:13.372 --> 21:15.874

THE POWERS OF HELL.

21:45.037 --> 21:46.772

23:00.078 --> 23:01.546
WHEN THEY FIND HER.

23:01.613 --> 23:05.117
THEY'LL SELL HER ASS
TO THE WHOREHOUSES
IN THAILAND.

23:05.183 --> 23:07.619
THIS IS
A NICE KNIFE.

23:07.686 --> 23:10.756
