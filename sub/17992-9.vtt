Announcer: Previously on
"Love and Hip Hop: Hollywood".

00:03.670 --> 00:06.373
{\an8}I brought you your [bleep]
back, your Monistat, your BV.

00:06.439 --> 00:08.641
{\an8}I'm tripping.

00:08.708 --> 00:10.210
{\an8}Broadcaster: Brandy's little
brother Ray J was arrested in

00:10.276 --> 00:12.946
{\an8}Beverly Hills on Friday night.

00:13.012 --> 00:15.448
{\an8}Listen, I need you to admit
to yourself that you

00:15.515 --> 00:17.350
{\an8}are losing control.

00:17.417 --> 00:18.618
{\an8}I don't have a problem.

00:18.685 --> 00:21.488
{\an8}You just have these days where
you just go off the deep end.

00:21.554 --> 00:23.556
{\an8}And it starts right
there in that cup.

00:23.623 --> 00:25.392
{\an8}I feel like I'm
owed an apology too.

00:25.458 --> 00:27.427
{\an8}Well, you're not going to get
it, because I'm not with you.

00:27.494 --> 00:29.696
{\an8}I don't have to get along
with you if I don't want to.

00:29.763 --> 00:31.197
{\an8}You won't be at the birth.

00:31.264 --> 00:32.131
{\an8}Oh, I won't?

00:32.198 --> 00:33.500
{\an8}I need you to apologize, ma.

00:33.566 --> 00:36.669
{\an8}I apologize, I didn't
mean of what I was saying.

00:36.736 --> 00:39.806
{\an8}It was a way of me
asking, can I help you?

00:39.873 --> 00:41.608
{\an8}I've been, like I
said, looking at places.

00:41.674 --> 00:42.675
{\an8}I actually brought her.

00:42.742 --> 00:43.877
{\an8}Moniece can't look
for a place by herself?

00:43.943 --> 00:45.111
{\an8}She's not an adult?

00:45.178 --> 00:47.113
{\an8}You can't come in here making
demands when we're not even

00:47.180 --> 00:48.214
{\an8}in a relationship.

00:48.281 --> 00:49.616
{\an8}Me and Drew, we're on a break.

00:49.682 --> 00:50.750
{\an8}Do you understand that?

00:50.817 --> 00:52.986
{\an8}Do you break up with Drew,
you break up with Cameron.

00:53.052 --> 00:54.120
{\an8}Do you take Cameron
to school every day?

00:54.187 --> 00:55.255
{\an8}Do you make him
dinner every night?

00:55.321 --> 00:56.656
{\an8}Do you make him a
bath every night?

00:56.723 --> 00:59.159
{\an8}Didn't I tell you?

00:59.225 --> 01:00.460
{\an8}I'm done with you.

01:00.527 --> 01:02.262
{\an8}Why the [bleep] do you get
to talk to me in that way?

01:02.328 --> 01:05.265
{\an8}That's why the [bleep] I
can't be with your ass.

01:05.331 --> 01:06.099
{\an8}You start working with Teairra.

01:06.166 --> 01:06.933
{\an8}Who, my boo?

01:07.000 --> 01:07.567
{\an8}That's your boo now?

01:07.634 --> 01:08.501
{\an8}I'm not working with you.

01:08.568 --> 01:09.969
{\an8}You can't use any
of my material.

01:10.036 --> 01:11.604
{\an8}You should try and
attack the song.

01:11.671 --> 01:12.906
{\an8}We can do something tonight.

01:12.972 --> 01:14.774
{\an8}We need an Instagram
or something like that.

01:14.841 --> 01:16.209
{\an8}[squeals]

01:16.276 --> 01:21.147
{\an8}I'm really confused by all
this that's going on, what's up?

01:21.214 --> 01:22.715
{\an8}You sound dumb as [bleep].

01:22.782 --> 01:25.118
{\an8}We're having an argument about
a [bleep] I've never [bleep],

01:25.185 --> 01:27.854
{\an8}don't want to [bleep]
and ain't gonna [bleep].

01:27.921 --> 01:28.888
{\an8}Baby, did you [bleep] her?

01:28.955 --> 01:29.856
{\an8}No.

01:29.923 --> 01:30.690
{\an8}Don't yell.

01:30.757 --> 01:32.358
{\an8}Don't [bleep] with me, bitch.

01:32.425 --> 01:34.694
{\an8}I couldn't think of a more
prettier face than yours to be

01:34.761 --> 01:36.362
{\an8}the face of my club.

01:36.429 --> 01:38.898
{\an8}One of my friends mother
owns the property,

01:38.965 --> 01:40.099
{\an8}the Maderas family.

01:40.166 --> 01:42.268
{\an8}I'm here to introduce
to you the face of Ace.

01:42.335 --> 01:43.503
{\an8}[cheers and applause]

01:43.570 --> 01:45.905
{\an8}Oh [bleep].

01:45.972 --> 01:51.444
{\an8}[cheers and applause]

01:51.511 --> 02:01.488
{\an5}♪♪

02:01.554 --> 02:21.474
{\an5}♪♪

02:23.376 --> 02:25.812
We're here to celebrate the
unveiling of our billboard

02:25.879 --> 02:27.347
for Ace of Diamonds.

02:27.413 --> 02:29.816
I'm here to introduce
to you the face of Ace.

02:29.883 --> 02:36.656
[cheers and applause]

02:36.723 --> 02:38.625
I came here to support the owner
of the Ace of Diamonds

02:38.691 --> 02:41.661
who's unveiling the billboard
of his new club in Vegas.

02:41.728 --> 02:44.230
My parents own the property
that the building sits on, so I

02:44.297 --> 02:47.367
thought I would show my pretty
face, but the face, rather the

02:47.433 --> 02:51.337
naked, flat ass i'm looking
at belongs to that ho Masika.

02:51.404 --> 02:52.605
Bitch, is that Masika?

02:52.672 --> 02:55.842
{\an5}Not only that, I was there when
that rat took the pictures and

02:55.909 --> 02:57.577
{\an5}she never said a [bleep] thing.

02:57.644 --> 03:00.613
If this bitch thinks I'm going
to let her face grace the entry

03:00.680 --> 03:04.317
of my family's property, then
she must not know me at all.

03:04.384 --> 03:09.656
It's Masika Kalysha.

03:09.722 --> 03:12.225
Clap, clap, clap.

03:12.292 --> 03:14.594
[cheers and applause]

03:14.661 --> 03:16.963
So, I'm glad I stayed around
to have a cocktail at the bar.

03:17.030 --> 03:20.466
I got to see all these fraud,
fake ass hos in the same room.

03:20.533 --> 03:23.970
I ain't even seen Teairra since
I moved out of the apartment.

03:24.037 --> 03:25.738
And the fact that she's
kicking it with Masika now,

03:25.805 --> 03:27.941
it's like these bitches
deserve each other.

03:28.007 --> 03:30.476
Pop champagne.

03:30.543 --> 03:33.379
So, I'm gazing through the crowd
and who's face do I see other

03:33.446 --> 03:36.149
{\an5}than that plastic Cabbage Patch
Nikki Ma-no-no looking bitch.

03:36.215 --> 03:38.685
Kind of glad that you're here
though, so I can see the look on

03:38.751 --> 03:41.721
your face when you find out that
my face is plastered all over

03:41.788 --> 03:43.556
mommy and daddy's building.

03:43.623 --> 03:47.260
Pick your face up off
the floor, sweetie.

03:47.327 --> 03:50.196
I see Hazel standing there
in all of her fraudness,

03:50.263 --> 03:52.966
and to be honest, I don't have
two words to say to her.

03:53.032 --> 03:56.035
Besides, I'm here with Nikki and
this reunion between Mally's two

03:56.102 --> 03:58.071
girls should be way more
interesting than

03:58.137 --> 04:01.341
anything Hazel-E's crater-face
ass has to say.

04:01.407 --> 04:02.208
Well, hello.

04:02.275 --> 04:03.376
Congratulations.

04:03.443 --> 04:04.477
Well, thank you, you
look absolutely gorgeous.

04:04.544 --> 04:05.545
That was cute.

04:05.612 --> 04:06.245
That was a surprise, bitch.

04:06.312 --> 04:07.513
Thank you for coming.

04:07.580 --> 04:08.548
Hello.

04:08.615 --> 04:10.817
So, you guys had a
little trick up your sleeve.

04:10.883 --> 04:12.085
When I walked in your photo
shoot, you were doing it

04:12.151 --> 04:12.952
for my club?

04:13.019 --> 04:13.753
Yeah.

04:13.820 --> 04:14.988
That's my club,
I'm the landlord.

04:15.054 --> 04:15.989
Your parents are the landlord.

04:16.055 --> 04:17.423
I can get you off
the billboard too.

04:17.490 --> 04:18.291
No, you can't.

04:18.358 --> 04:19.225
You don't
understand, I'm the boss.

04:19.291 --> 04:20.392
You're not the boss.

04:20.459 --> 04:21.827
I work for the clubs.

04:21.894 --> 04:24.030
You work daddy's credit card.

04:24.097 --> 04:26.666
Well, well, well, it looks like
the backstabber Masika got

04:26.733 --> 04:28.434
more problems than just me.

04:28.501 --> 04:29.736
If they were here,
they'd be the boss.

04:29.802 --> 04:31.270
If it isn't miss boomerang.

04:31.337 --> 04:32.505
I just threw her out
and she came back.

04:32.572 --> 04:34.807
First of all, pause.

04:34.874 --> 04:36.142
You know I can't pass
up an opportunity to go

04:36.209 --> 04:37.844
and mix things up.

04:37.910 --> 04:40.980
What up, TT, haven't seen
you since the move out.

04:41.047 --> 04:43.082
And what's crazy is like word
on the street is some crazy

04:43.149 --> 04:45.118
[bleep], Berg
calling you his boo.

04:45.184 --> 04:46.919
And I'm like, damn.

04:46.986 --> 04:49.522
We might have had our issues,
but I never thought we'd would

04:49.589 --> 04:51.591
like go behind each other.

04:51.658 --> 04:53.593
Well, first of all,
I'm not Berg's boo.

04:53.660 --> 04:56.963
I was like, TT couldn't
always be doing that [bleep].

04:57.030 --> 04:59.298
No, you actually said
that's what Teairra's known for,

04:59.365 --> 05:01.267
because she could be doing
it, but I hope she wouldn't.

05:01.334 --> 05:03.636
Actually, why don't you see your
way out of this conversation.

05:03.703 --> 05:05.338
Why don't you see your
way out of the club.

05:05.405 --> 05:09.342
See how me and Teairra
have anything to do with you.

05:09.409 --> 05:12.145
Hold up, wait a minute, I want
to know what the [bleep]

05:12.211 --> 05:13.713
you've been saying to
this bitch about me.

05:13.780 --> 05:15.281
She said you're a bum bitch.

05:15.348 --> 05:16.616
You [bleep]
everything in the streets.

05:16.683 --> 05:17.850
You're a sex addict.

05:17.917 --> 05:19.118
You'll [bleep] everybody's man.

05:19.185 --> 05:20.153
You'll [bleep] anything.

05:20.219 --> 05:20.820
What?

05:20.887 --> 05:21.988
You're an alcoholic.

05:22.055 --> 05:22.789
You're a drunk bitch.

05:22.855 --> 05:24.023
You need rehab.

05:24.090 --> 05:26.325
And a whole bunch of
stuff, a whole bunch of stuff.

05:26.392 --> 05:27.360
Really?

05:27.427 --> 05:28.861
She's making half
that [bleep] up.

05:28.928 --> 05:31.130
Which half?

05:31.197 --> 05:33.399
You know what, it's one thing to
hear all the trash talking that

05:33.466 --> 05:35.168
Hazel did to Berg.

05:35.234 --> 05:38.237
They were in an argument and
she let loose, I get that.

05:38.304 --> 05:41.641
But for this [bleep] bitch to
run to Masika and Kiki about

05:41.708 --> 05:43.943
my news, that's crossing a line.

05:44.010 --> 05:45.344
I don't even know Masika.

05:45.411 --> 05:47.814
This is a person that I lived
with and I considered

05:47.880 --> 05:49.415
a [bleep] friend.

05:49.482 --> 05:52.218
Bitch, you must have
lost your complete mind.

05:52.285 --> 05:53.986
You're making
yourself look like a fool.

05:54.053 --> 05:55.755
I'm not [bleep] Berg.

05:55.822 --> 05:57.757
I don't want to [bleep] Berg.

05:57.824 --> 05:59.058
What more do you want to hear?

05:59.125 --> 06:00.660
I believe in the code.

06:00.727 --> 06:01.928
You know rule number one.

06:01.994 --> 06:04.897
If you knew the code, you would
have told me you was moving out.

06:04.964 --> 06:06.966
Actually, if you would have
never turned up on me in the

06:07.033 --> 06:08.501
house, I would never
have had no reason.

06:08.568 --> 06:10.503
So, don't talk about a code
right now because if you want to

06:10.570 --> 06:15.775
take it back to me moving out
the house, you're taking it back

06:15.842 --> 06:16.809
to say, "Teairra, we don't
[bleep] with each

06:16.876 --> 06:17.710
other no more."

06:17.777 --> 06:18.945
So, you're not his boo?

06:19.011 --> 06:19.912
I'm not his boo.

06:19.979 --> 06:21.414
The problem is Berg.

06:21.481 --> 06:23.449
You're man about a [bleep] she
don't want, I don't want

06:23.516 --> 06:24.751
and don't want you.

06:24.817 --> 06:26.285
Shut the [bleep] up, bitch.

06:26.352 --> 06:27.620
You watch your [bleep] mouth.

06:27.687 --> 06:29.388
You're back in the Ray J
situation, T, you said he

06:29.455 --> 06:30.990
was fronting you out.

06:31.057 --> 06:32.325
You said you didn't.

06:32.391 --> 06:33.593
He did front me out.

06:33.659 --> 06:36.195
And Berg fronted me out too, so
why don't you understand that?

06:36.262 --> 06:38.631
Why do I get to have your
back and you don't have mine?

06:38.698 --> 06:40.032
Straight up.

06:40.099 --> 06:40.800
Stop.

06:40.867 --> 06:42.168
Straight up, T.

06:42.235 --> 06:44.170
What the [bleep] more
did you want to hear?

06:44.237 --> 06:45.104
Why did you do it?

06:45.171 --> 06:46.539
Because I like the record.

06:46.606 --> 06:47.473
And that's you.

06:47.540 --> 06:48.541
Good luck.

06:48.608 --> 06:51.210
So, all my fraud ass fake
ex-friends want to join

06:51.277 --> 06:52.912
together against me?

06:52.979 --> 06:55.948
I don't need none of y'all
hos in my life, I'm out.

06:56.015 --> 06:57.416
Good luck.

06:57.483 --> 06:58.417
Bye.

06:58.484 --> 06:59.886
Seriously, where's
the damn security.

06:59.952 --> 07:02.522
Watching Berg's
harem explode was fun.

07:02.588 --> 07:04.624
I didn't get to say everything
I needed to say to that ho,

07:04.690 --> 07:07.160
Masika, but I think Hazel
was everything she can

07:07.226 --> 07:08.528
handle for one night.

07:51.370 --> 07:55.842
and your crazy ass baby
momma grabbed my hair

07:55.908 --> 07:56.676
and pulled my hair.

07:56.742 --> 07:57.410
What?

07:57.476 --> 07:58.277
Are you okay?

07:58.344 --> 07:59.345
I'm fine.

07:59.412 --> 08:01.080
Sheesh.

08:01.147 --> 08:02.915
It's like yo.

08:02.982 --> 08:04.250
That's your reaction.

08:04.317 --> 08:05.685
This is the problem
that I have with Drew.

08:05.751 --> 08:07.620
He never steps up
when it counts.

08:07.687 --> 08:10.089
He's never there for me
when I truly need him.

08:10.156 --> 08:11.224
He knows Moniece is crazy.

08:11.290 --> 08:14.260
I need a man, not a pretty boy.

08:14.327 --> 08:16.128
I need you to be present and do
something in the moment

08:16.195 --> 08:16.963
when I need you.

08:17.029 --> 08:17.530
What happened?

08:17.597 --> 08:18.631
What was said?

08:18.698 --> 08:20.032
It doesn't matter if we were
[bleep] saying the ABC's

08:20.099 --> 08:20.800
to each other.

08:20.867 --> 08:21.934
What?

08:22.001 --> 08:23.436
The bottom line is that
she put her hands on me.

08:23.502 --> 08:24.804
I'm going to go talk to her
and I'm going to handle it.

08:24.871 --> 08:25.872
You're going to do
more than talk to her.

08:25.938 --> 08:27.473
What do you mean
more than talk to her?

08:27.540 --> 08:28.808
Like, I'm going to go talk to
her and check her that you

08:28.875 --> 08:30.576
need to calm down with
your tone first off.

08:30.643 --> 08:31.544
No, I'm not going to calm down.

08:31.611 --> 08:33.011
Yes, you need to calm down.

08:33.078 --> 08:34.179
The person that you decided to
have a child with laid

08:34.246 --> 08:35.214
her hands on me.

08:35.280 --> 08:36.349
I'm going to go talk to her.

08:36.414 --> 08:38.116
{\an5}No, it's not cool that
Moniece put her hands on Amanda.

08:38.183 --> 08:39.684
{\an5}But at the end of the day we
were on a break,

08:39.751 --> 08:41.220
so what did you expect?

08:41.287 --> 08:43.188
Like you still can't
stay away from Moniece?

08:43.256 --> 08:44.190
Come on, man.

08:44.256 --> 08:45.358
What you want me to do?

08:45.424 --> 08:47.193
The first time that you met
with her, you got nowhere.

08:47.260 --> 08:48.661
So, I didn't tell you
to go meet with her.

08:48.728 --> 08:50.363
You chose to take
that upon yourself.

08:50.429 --> 08:51.364
So, this is my fault, is this
what you're saying,

08:51.430 --> 08:53.232
that I put myself
in the situation.

08:53.299 --> 08:54.700
I didn't say it was your fault,
but yes, at the end of the day

08:54.767 --> 08:56.669
you put yourself in this
predicament, straight up.

08:56.736 --> 08:58.004
This is our [bleep].

08:58.070 --> 08:59.372
As a man I'm your girl.

08:59.438 --> 09:00.773
You decided to go talk to her.

09:00.840 --> 09:01.707
You decided to go talk to her.

09:01.774 --> 09:02.642
If I want to talk
to her, [bleep].

09:02.708 --> 09:03.809
If that's what you
want to do, then bounce.

09:03.876 --> 09:06.479
I'm a man, I handle
mine, I raise my kid.

09:06.545 --> 09:07.647
Then bounce.

09:07.713 --> 09:09.282
What exactly did you handle?

09:09.348 --> 09:10.316
All that [bleep], yo.

09:10.383 --> 09:11.584
You're very
ignorant and immature.

09:11.651 --> 09:13.686
You don't know how to handle any
situations like a grown woman.

09:13.753 --> 09:18.257
There's no grown woman,
you're blaming on me.

09:18.324 --> 09:20.760
{\an8}About us living together,
man, we should push that back.

09:20.826 --> 09:21.661
{\an8}Why?

09:21.727 --> 09:22.728
{\an8}What is this?

09:22.795 --> 09:23.963
{\an8}This is her mugshot.

09:24.030 --> 09:26.032
{\an8}Shoplifting and petty theft.

09:26.098 --> 09:27.767
{\an8}I could sit here and
talk about you too.

09:27.833 --> 09:30.770
{\an8}I could be like, "Okay,
seen the bitch's mugshot."

09:30.836 --> 09:32.805
{\an8}I'm not apologizing to her.

09:32.872 --> 09:34.573
{\an8}[bleep] you, shove it up your
ass and [bleep] deal

09:34.640 --> 09:35.708
{\an8}with it, bitch.

09:35.775 --> 09:36.709
{\an8}How about you eat some granite?

09:36.776 --> 09:37.977
{\an8}How does that taste?

09:38.044 --> 09:40.379
{\an8}There's a war going on
inside and yo know who's losing?

09:40.446 --> 09:41.480
{\an8}You.

09:41.547 --> 09:42.748
{\an8}I'm sorry if I let y'all down.

09:42.815 --> 09:43.683
{\an8}I'm going to do better.

09:43.749 --> 09:44.583
{\an8}I promise, pop.

09:44.650 --> 09:46.953
{\an8}Baby's almost here.

09:47.019 --> 09:50.523
{\an8}And I'm going into a
contraction, one second.

09:50.589 --> 09:52.325
{\an8}Oh my God, hold on.

09:52.391 --> 09:53.626
{\an8}Mmm hmm.

09:53.693 --> 09:57.697
♪♪

10:02.234 --> 10:05.338
Oh my God, oh, bugs, oh my God.

10:05.404 --> 10:09.175
I can't deal,
especially with the pregnancy.

10:09.241 --> 10:10.710
I really can't deal with bugs.

10:10.776 --> 10:12.311
I gotta waddle.

10:12.378 --> 10:13.145
It's okay.

10:13.212 --> 10:14.714
It looks sexy on you, baby.

10:14.780 --> 10:16.248
I gotta take a seat real quick.

10:16.315 --> 10:17.416
My back.

10:17.483 --> 10:18.718
I'm due any day now.

10:18.784 --> 10:22.221
And at this point I'm so
ready for this baby to be here.

10:22.288 --> 10:25.224
I'm excited, but I'm
nervous at the same time.

10:25.291 --> 10:29.295
Omari has been amazing, but
that's not helping me because

10:29.362 --> 10:32.665
all I'm thinking about is
dropping this baby today.

10:32.732 --> 10:34.834
I want to commend you, you know,
on handling the situation

10:34.900 --> 10:36.802
with my mom as a woman.

10:36.869 --> 10:38.070
I respect that.

10:38.137 --> 10:40.206
You know, but I know you have
your own issues with your mom.

10:40.272 --> 10:41.574
Right.

10:41.640 --> 10:43.642
I'm going to have to have a
conversation with her, you know,

10:43.709 --> 10:45.378
when they come out here and
they visit, obviously,

10:45.444 --> 10:46.545
for the birthing.

10:46.612 --> 10:49.015
I want to talk to her about
my relationship with her.

10:49.081 --> 10:51.050
What do you want from her,
though, because you know.

10:51.117 --> 10:53.119
Closeness with my mom.

10:53.185 --> 10:55.187
I look at your relationship with
your mom and you know,

10:55.254 --> 10:59.025
granted she's as crazy as hell
with me, but y'all are close.

10:59.091 --> 11:01.427
I don't know anything much about
my mom because she doesn't

11:01.494 --> 11:02.595
talk about her life.

11:02.661 --> 11:03.996
She loves you though.

11:04.063 --> 11:05.197
I know she loves me, but that
has nothing to do with

11:05.264 --> 11:07.099
feeling like I have a
connection with my mom.

11:07.166 --> 11:08.334
Right.

11:08.401 --> 11:10.002
Because I don't feel like I
had a lot of love from my mom.

11:10.069 --> 11:10.770
That's true.

11:10.836 --> 11:12.104
It's like, who are you?

11:12.171 --> 11:14.407
Do you really love your kids?

11:14.473 --> 11:18.177
{\an5}Miss Leslie can definitely be a
pain in my ass, but I understand

11:18.244 --> 11:20.279
that she just loves Omari.

11:20.346 --> 11:22.748
It has me questioning my mom a
little bit, you know, because

11:22.815 --> 11:24.984
she never really
showed affection like that.

11:25.051 --> 11:26.719
There's pieces of me that I
obviously need to figure

11:26.786 --> 11:28.154
out from my mom.

11:28.220 --> 11:31.323
Growing up and not understanding
why things happened, I naturally

11:31.390 --> 11:32.992
disliked my mom and my dad.

11:33.059 --> 11:36.796
But as I've gotten older and now
that I understand that my mom,

11:36.862 --> 11:39.632
you know, she's not from
here, she's from Taiwan, all her

11:39.698 --> 11:41.567
family members are from Taiwan.

11:41.634 --> 11:43.836
So my dad's mom had
to take care of us.

11:43.903 --> 11:46.439
My mom wasn't involved in my
life very much growing up.

11:46.505 --> 11:49.408
She sent me and my sister to go
live with my grandmother while

11:49.475 --> 11:53.279
she kept the two older siblings
because my dad was incarcerated.

11:53.345 --> 11:56.248
I don't know anything from the
relatives that I have in Taiwan

11:56.315 --> 11:59.885
to why my sisters and I weren't
raised together, to why

11:59.952 --> 12:01.720
my father was incarcerated.

12:01.787 --> 12:03.756
There's so many questions that I
have to ask my mom now

12:03.823 --> 12:06.025
because I'm about to be a mom.

12:06.092 --> 12:08.427
So, it's really important
for me to know my history.

12:08.494 --> 12:11.163
There's just certain things
that I feel like I need to know.

12:11.230 --> 12:14.266
I just want to dig in her hurt
and find out why my dad,

12:14.333 --> 12:18.003
why he went to jail, why she
wasn't involved with him and

12:18.070 --> 12:20.072
communicating with him and
letting him try to be a

12:20.139 --> 12:21.507
part of my life.

12:21.574 --> 12:23.075
I want to find out her pain.

12:23.142 --> 12:24.310
She kind of covers it up.

12:24.376 --> 12:25.911
And I don't know if
it's to protect us.

12:25.978 --> 12:28.347
There's missing parts of a
puzzle that I can't piece

12:28.414 --> 12:30.950
together unless I have
this conversation with her.

12:31.016 --> 12:34.520
I know that Apryl has some
communication issues with her

12:34.587 --> 12:37.756
moms, which can cause
resentment and frustration.

12:37.823 --> 12:41.460
But since Chachi is coming into
town, hopefully Apryl and her

12:41.527 --> 12:44.797
can sit down and they can have a
mother to daughter talk

12:44.864 --> 12:46.866
and fix their issues.

12:46.932 --> 12:50.703
But for now my mom is here,
which is good,

12:50.769 --> 12:52.371
because she apologized,
now she can be a part of

12:52.438 --> 12:54.807
this beautiful pregnancy.

12:54.874 --> 12:57.977
Family, friends, we need
everyone to be in one accord.

12:58.043 --> 13:04.416
I really need to understand
who I am to be the type of mom

13:04.483 --> 13:05.851
I need to be for my son.

13:05.918 --> 13:07.219
You will.

13:07.286 --> 13:08.654
Well, let's go, baby.

13:08.721 --> 13:10.589
Let's get this walk out, okay.

13:10.656 --> 13:12.825
Wait, my ass.

13:12.892 --> 13:14.293
Well.

13:14.360 --> 13:15.327
Ow.

13:15.394 --> 13:17.196
You got that big ole
ass, that's what you got.

13:17.263 --> 13:19.698
I know.

13:19.765 --> 13:21.534
Let's walk this baby out.

13:21.600 --> 13:27.540
♪♪

13:27.606 --> 13:28.507
{\an5}Look, what about these?

13:28.574 --> 13:29.575
No.

13:29.642 --> 13:30.976
You don't think I
look good like a nerd?

13:31.043 --> 13:33.379
Nerd swag or
gangster rapper swag?

13:33.445 --> 13:34.146
What are you?

13:34.213 --> 13:35.848
Both.

13:35.915 --> 13:37.183
That is true.

13:37.249 --> 13:38.751
{\an5}Dre has some shows in Brazil
coming up and I can't

13:38.817 --> 13:40.786
{\an5}go because I have Cam.

13:40.853 --> 13:43.822
{\an5}So, that means I can't keep an
eye on him and I won't know

13:43.889 --> 13:46.458
if he's mingling with
the Brazilian bitches.

13:46.525 --> 13:49.128
But to keep my mind off of it,
I'm going to try and settle in

13:49.195 --> 13:50.896
at the house while he's gone.

13:50.963 --> 13:52.364
What your daddy said about me?

13:52.431 --> 13:53.299
Was he feeling me?

13:53.365 --> 13:54.533
Was he not feeling me?

13:54.600 --> 13:56.802
He didn't say if he was or not.

13:56.869 --> 13:58.571
I think he wants to see it.

13:58.637 --> 14:00.039
He doesn't want to
keep talking about it.

14:00.105 --> 14:03.943
I think he'll realize that once
we live together and he knows

14:04.009 --> 14:08.147
how you are with Cam and he gets
to see that, he'll understand.

14:08.214 --> 14:11.717
About us living together,
man, we should push

14:11.784 --> 14:14.753
that back a little bit?

14:14.820 --> 14:16.088
Why?

14:16.155 --> 14:18.123
Because I'm leaving for
Brazil like tomorrow.

14:18.190 --> 14:20.859
I got like 11 shows.

14:20.926 --> 14:22.928
I'm going to be
gone like two weeks.

14:22.995 --> 14:25.364
It's not a gated community,
anybody could just pull up.

14:25.431 --> 14:26.865
Fans know where I live at.

14:26.932 --> 14:28.801
They'll be riding by the
house taking pictures.

14:28.867 --> 14:32.571
And your pops just told me,
make sure that you're safe.

14:32.638 --> 14:35.608
{\an5}Mr. Teddy Riley got the boy
kind of nervous right now.

14:35.674 --> 14:38.644
{\an5}I'm pretty sure I can take care
of his princess, live up to the

14:38.711 --> 14:40.946
{\an5}expectations and make sure
she's safe, but right now's

14:41.013 --> 14:42.514
not the time for that.

14:42.581 --> 14:45.084
I gotta focus on my
career, my music and my tour.

14:45.150 --> 14:46.986
I gotta focus on this
Brazil turn up,

14:47.052 --> 14:48.220
you dig what I'm saying?

14:48.287 --> 14:50.322
I'm going to need Nia to just
chill out at her mom's house

14:50.389 --> 14:52.992
and relax until I get back.

14:53.058 --> 14:54.293
I'm thinking about
the big picture.

14:54.360 --> 14:55.194
I'm thinking about Cam.

14:55.261 --> 14:56.295
I'm thinking about your safety.

14:56.362 --> 14:57.463
Nobody's going to be there.

14:57.529 --> 14:59.298
None of my security
is going to be there.

14:59.365 --> 15:01.200
Why can't you leave
somebody there with us?

15:01.267 --> 15:04.436
Because everybody's
going on tour with me.

15:04.503 --> 15:06.005
I should have known Dre was
going to find an excuse

15:06.071 --> 15:08.540
for us to postpone us
moving in together.

15:08.607 --> 15:10.309
I'm starting to think if
it's ever going to happen.

15:10.376 --> 15:11.944
I've been through this before.

15:12.011 --> 15:13.345
We're good.

15:13.412 --> 15:15.848
He goes on tour and
something always happens to

15:15.914 --> 15:17.416
drive us apart.

15:17.483 --> 15:19.118
We were just getting to
a really good place

15:19.184 --> 15:21.687
and now he's leaving again.

15:21.754 --> 15:26.292
I don't even know if I want to
do the move in at the house.

15:26.358 --> 15:28.360
Maybe we can use the house,
but maybe we should look for a

15:28.427 --> 15:31.030

15:34.300 --> 15:36.035
I can have my man cave.

15:36.101 --> 15:36.969
For what?

15:37.036 --> 15:38.737
To do what?

15:38.804 --> 15:40.406
To smoke.

15:40.472 --> 15:42.741
Now, a man needs to be
able to hold on to something.

15:42.808 --> 15:44.777
I'm willing to sacrifice a lot
for this relationship,

15:44.843 --> 15:46.645

15:46.712 --> 15:50.482
I still need to be able to turn
up inside and outside the crib.

Nia know all this about me

15:53.886 --> 15:59.224
All right, I don't like it, but
I'll wait until you get back.

15:59.291 --> 16:01.560

16:01.627 --> 16:02.761

16:50.642 --> 16:51.844

16:51.910 --> 16:53.345
Nine years?

16:53.412 --> 16:54.680
No, nine hours.

Nine hours in Beverly Hills.

{\an5}But I know Willie Ray Norwood
Junior's got to be scared.

17:03.322 --> 17:04.990
He's facing some
real serious charges.

17:05.057 --> 17:06.625
He ain't built for this
whole lock up thing, man.

17:06.692 --> 17:08.227
What'd they charge you with?

17:08.292 --> 17:12.196
They charged me with ten counts
of like battery, trespassing,

17:12.263 --> 17:13.632
vandalism, resisting arrest.

17:13.699 --> 17:14.800
What'd you think
going to happen?

17:14.867 --> 17:16.300
You think they're going
to push the line on you

17:16.367 --> 17:17.269
and do some jail time?

17:17.336 --> 17:18.369
It's in God's hands.

17:18.436 --> 17:19.805
Man, I don't know.

17:19.872 --> 17:20.973

17:21.039 --> 17:22.273
She knows what she's doing.

17:22.340 --> 17:24.943
I'm going to tell you what
you told me years ago, bro.

17:25.010 --> 17:27.346
You just gotta learn
how to control your high?

How you doing?

17:30.082 --> 17:31.116
I'm amazing, man.

17:31.183 --> 17:32.618
We bros, so I'm going to
lay everything on the table.

17:32.684 --> 17:36.755
So, Hazel
reintroduced me back to Teairra.

17:36.822 --> 17:39.858
We end up getting cool
and we hit the stew.

17:39.925 --> 17:41.093
And I end up giving her a hit.

17:41.160 --> 17:42.294
So.

17:42.361 --> 17:43.629
You know what I thought
you was about to tell me?

17:43.695 --> 17:44.363
What?

17:44.430 --> 17:45.697
That you [bleep] her.

17:45.764 --> 17:47.032
We don't [bleep]

17:49.268 --> 17:50.302

17:50.369 --> 17:51.437

{\an5}I ain't even going to lie.

17:52.905 --> 17:56.708
{\an5}When Teairra coming around and
titties all out, she's a fest,

17:56.775 --> 17:58.177
she's something to be at.

17:58.243 --> 18:00.846
But me and my smashing

You didn't give me all the
details, you just said it

18:06.118 --> 18:07.519

18:07.586 --> 18:09.188
She put her hands on me.

18:09.254 --> 18:11.990
I told y'all she was violent.

18:12.057 --> 18:14.059
Sincere, he not even with her.

18:14.126 --> 18:15.260

I'm saying she can sing,
but shorty,

18:16.929 --> 18:18.096
she got a real bad temper.

18:18.163 --> 18:18.831
She hit him.

18:18.897 --> 18:19.798
She hit me.

18:19.865 --> 18:21.233
She hit Hazel.

18:21.300 --> 18:22.134
She talked about you.

18:22.201 --> 18:23.235
You're next.

18:23.302 --> 18:25.437
You're [bleep] next, man.

18:25.504 --> 18:26.638
Good luck.

18:26.705 --> 18:29.408
All I know is she came to
see me after I got locked up.

18:29.475 --> 18:31.310
She came to get some closure or
whatever and I'm like,

18:31.376 --> 18:34.213
"Why you need closure if we
ain't ever been together?"

18:34.279 --> 18:36.181
Berg, listen.

18:36.248 --> 18:38.317
You're cool with me
working with her?

18:38.383 --> 18:39.751
I'm cool with you working with
her, but at the same time,

18:39.818 --> 18:41.854
she went so hard on you,
I don't know if you should

18:41.920 --> 18:42.955
be cool working her.

18:43.021 --> 18:44.156
Yeah, you shouldn't be.

18:44.223 --> 18:45.557
And I don't know if y'all
should be asking me the type of

18:45.624 --> 18:47.693
questions since I'm cool
with working with her.

18:47.759 --> 18:49.761
You know what, it kind of threw
me left and then it threw me

18:49.828 --> 18:52.164

Teairra are cool because

18:52.231 --> 18:53.732

18:55.601 --> 18:57.669
I ain't got nothing but love if
Berg said he's going to make

18:57.736 --> 18:59.872
a hit for her, then make a hit.

18:59.938 --> 19:01.673
Just know that she
gonna hit you if you don't.

19:01.740 --> 19:03.475

appropriate that she's on the

20:31.597 --> 20:33.765
billboard promoting the club.

20:33.832 --> 20:35.968
To be honest, I've been in
the business for 35 years.

20:36.034 --> 20:39.671
If I was going to put a girl on
a billboard, she's going to

20:39.738 --> 20:42.708
be a girl that looks like
she's ready to strip.

20:42.774 --> 20:45.177
When I look at this billboard,
it looks like it's advertising

20:45.243 --> 20:48.080
for a bathtub.

We can't do that.

20:53.285 --> 20:54.553
Why?

20:54.620 --> 20:57.723
Sam has a lease and Sam can
put anybody he likes

20:57.789 --> 20:58.957
on the billboard.

20:59.024 --> 21:00.158
It's business.

21:00.225 --> 21:02.628
{\an5}Sam may have the lease, but
my family owns the property.

type of idea to promote herself.

You know, she's just a
vixen, she's just a video girl.

21:17.876 --> 21:19.411

21:19.478 --> 21:20.879
of obsession with me.

21:20.946 --> 21:22.381
No question about it.

23:21.600 --> 23:25.637
around Cameron she's
all in for Cameron.

23:25.704 --> 23:28.240
It's not your duty to protect
him, it's mine because

23:28.306 --> 23:29.508
he's with me.

23:29.574 --> 23:33.512
Whether he's with me or not, I
still have a maternal instinct.

23:33.578 --> 23:35.280
I have Cameron's best interest.

23:35.347 --> 23:38.683
Whatever actions I take is
what he's going to be a part of.

23:38.750 --> 23:41.386
Period, because he's with me.

23:41.453 --> 23:43.288
Me and Amanda are done,
like literally

23:43.355 --> 23:45.690
with a capital D, done.

23:45.757 --> 23:48.293
So, I'll be damned if Moneice
try to sit up here and dictate

23:48.360 --> 23:49.861
who I can be with.

23:49.928 --> 23:51.463
At the end of the day, you know,
I'm never going to put

23:51.530 --> 23:53.198
Cameron in any harm's way.

23:53.265 --> 23:54.966
I don't want him around anybody.

23:55.033 --> 23:57.402
I'm always even cautious
bringing him around you.

23:57.469 --> 24:00.071
I look at Amanda and I don't see
a young woman who's ready

24:00.138 --> 24:02.574
to be a mother to
someone else's child.

24:02.641 --> 24:03.775
My child.

24:03.842 --> 24:04.843
I don't know why.

24:04.910 --> 24:06.945
That's the vibe I get from her.

24:07.012 --> 24:08.180
I'm sorry you had that vibe.

24:08.246 --> 24:09.981
That's something you're
going to have to get over.

24:10.048 --> 24:14.119
I'm expressing to you what
I feel and why I feel it.

24:14.186 --> 24:15.387
[bleep] you, shove it up
your ass and [bleep]

24:15.453 --> 24:16.855
deal with it, bitch.

24:16.922 --> 24:20.091
It's what you're saying to
me in a round about way.

24:20.158 --> 24:22.694
At the end of the day, unless
Cameron is coming to you and

24:22.761 --> 24:26.731
saying, he's affected by Amanda,
or whoever I'm with, then you

24:26.798 --> 24:28.033
shouldn't have no concern.

24:28.099 --> 24:28.800
She's a whore.

24:28.867 --> 24:29.734
Period, period.

24:29.801 --> 24:30.435
She's over there,
she's [bleep] this one,

24:30.502 --> 24:31.503
she's [bleep] that one.

24:31.570 --> 24:33.705
She's with you, she's
with Cam, then she's not.

24:33.772 --> 24:36.107
I don't know if the bitch is
going to be [bleep] when

24:36.174 --> 24:37.742
you go out of town and
she's with Cameron.

24:37.809 --> 24:38.944
I don't [bleep] know.

24:39.010 --> 24:41.179
The bitch is messy and
that's the vibe I get.

24:41.246 --> 24:44.282
And so when a bitch walks into a
meeting and sit down with me and

24:44.349 --> 24:48.620
tells me what you feel about
your son is irrelevant and I'm

24:48.687 --> 24:52.891
going to do me, regardless of
what you feel, [bleep] you.

24:52.958 --> 24:54.559
Bitch, no [bleep] you.

24:54.626 --> 24:57.262
How about you eat some
granite, how does that taste?

24:57.329 --> 24:58.430
You like it?

24:58.496 --> 24:59.464
You're out of line.

24:59.531 --> 25:00.932
The next time you'll
be chewing cement.

25:00.999 --> 25:02.534
And I'm not apologizing to her.

25:02.601 --> 25:04.870
Both of y'all [bleep] is crazy.

25:04.936 --> 25:07.005
I don't know what's
going on with her.

25:07.072 --> 25:08.073
I don't know what's
going on with you,

25:08.139 --> 25:09.274

Y'all stupid, yo.

25:11.142 --> 25:13.011
Unless it's affecting our child,
it has nothing to do with

25:13.078 --> 25:15.046
how you feel.

25:15.113 --> 25:17.182
I'm telling you I feel like
it will affect our child.

25:17.249 --> 25:19.417
Our son loves that girl,
regardless of if I'm with

25:19.484 --> 25:21.152
her or not, he loves her.

25:21.219 --> 25:24.623
I wouldn't be shocked if the
next time you see Amanda

25:24.689 --> 25:27.058
the bitch is lumped up, or
you don't see her at all.
