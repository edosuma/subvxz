01:47.068 --> 01:49.228
We should ring
the bells in victory.

01:49.230 --> 01:52.592
Every traitor netted overnight
and taken to the Tower.

01:52.594 --> 01:54.954
And Margaret Pole
was found this morning,

01:54.956 --> 01:56.476
so she will be
taken there, too.

01:57.999 --> 02:00.320
There's a small army
gathering outside, Henry.

02:00.322 --> 02:02.041
You planning to arrest
the whole of London?

02:02.043 --> 02:04.444
The French are
restless in Europe,

02:04.446 --> 02:06.446
and the pope
has fears for Venice.

02:06.448 --> 02:08.168
<i>I am sending men
to Kent,</i>

02:08.169 --> 02:10.050
where the French can
feel us watching them.

02:10.051 --> 02:11.892
And if King Louis
decides to march to us

02:11.894 --> 02:13.333
as well
as south to Venice,

02:13.335 --> 02:15.295
then we will
be ready for him.

02:15.297 --> 02:17.339
You are peaky.

02:18.901 --> 02:20.420
I didn't sleep.

02:20.422 --> 02:22.262
I just need some
spearmint for my chest,

02:22.264 --> 02:24.266
and it will pass.

02:37.440 --> 02:39.079
- Lina.
- So you are back

02:39.081 --> 02:40.881
from your night's work
as a Tudor.

02:40.883 --> 02:42.123
I am a soldier
of the court.

02:42.125 --> 02:44.325
Does Lady Pole
now wear their chains?

02:44.327 --> 02:45.486
She's a traitor.

02:45.488 --> 02:47.850
She plotted
on the king's life.

02:51.054 --> 02:53.094
Lina, the army
marches out to Kent.

02:53.096 --> 02:55.416
In two days,
I go with them

02:55.418 --> 02:59.460
and then perhaps
to war in France.

02:59.462 --> 03:01.182
I only joined this army,

03:01.184 --> 03:04.225
because you said you
would not have me.

03:04.227 --> 03:06.668
We could have had
a different life

03:06.670 --> 03:08.952
if you were
not so proud.

03:11.595 --> 03:13.597
Where have you
taken Lady Pole?

03:15.119 --> 03:16.478
Is she in the Tower?

03:16.480 --> 03:18.280
She is unharmed,

03:18.282 --> 03:20.284
and so are
both her children.

03:21.125 --> 03:23.127
We must go there now.

03:24.288 --> 03:26.290
Of course.

03:27.772 --> 03:30.092
<i>I must offer
her what aid I can.</i>

03:30.094 --> 03:32.735
Then I will ride
to Hatfield

03:32.737 --> 03:34.739
and hope that I
may see the prince.

03:43.948 --> 03:47.470
Curiously, I'm warming
to this creature.

03:47.472 --> 03:49.592
It keeps its own counsel,

03:49.594 --> 03:52.957
and it doesn't
suffer patronage.

03:56.281 --> 03:59.202
Does the bird
not cheer you, Henry?

03:59.204 --> 04:01.366
That depends
on how it will taste.

04:06.091 --> 04:08.291
Do you have to walk in here
when I am bathing?

04:08.293 --> 04:10.213
I'm your mother.
I held you

04:10.215 --> 04:12.415
when you were a babe
in swaddling.

04:12.417 --> 04:14.538
<i>We should celebrate.</i>

04:14.540 --> 04:17.380
Our enemies at home
are all apprehended,

04:17.382 --> 04:22.145
and I believe I've found
a new wife for you.

04:22.147 --> 04:25.829
Our enemies breed faster
every time we catch one.

04:25.831 --> 04:28.154
They're like rats.

04:29.555 --> 04:31.635
Lizzie told me
if I ruled with fear,

04:31.637 --> 04:33.717
I'd only get dissent
and hatred in retu...

04:35.161 --> 04:37.163
<i>She was right.</i>

04:38.805 --> 04:40.887
She and her mother
both had the sight.

04:42.248 --> 04:45.369
And Lizzie said
if Harry married Catherine,

04:45.371 --> 04:47.453
<i>he would never have
a son and heir.</i>

04:49.335 --> 04:51.055
He doesn't know it,
but that's why

04:51.057 --> 04:53.337
I told him
he must marry Eleanor.

04:54.661 --> 04:56.781
<i>Well, the wife
I picked for you,</i>

04:56.783 --> 04:58.863
the Duchess of Savoy...

04:58.865 --> 05:01.306
she's daughter to the
Emperor Maximilian,

05:01.308 --> 05:03.788
so she brings with her
a useful new alliance.

05:05.992 --> 05:07.872
<i>What do you say to that?</i>

05:12.599 --> 05:14.439
<i>Henry?</i>

05:16.884 --> 05:18.886
Don't ignore me.

05:32.259 --> 05:34.420
Henry.

05:34.422 --> 05:36.424
Henry.

05:36.864 --> 05:38.866
Henry.

05:48.116 --> 05:50.797
You're lucky I don't put you
in there with all the men.

05:50.799 --> 05:51.798
<i>Mother!</i>

05:51.800 --> 05:53.802
Henry.

05:56.084 --> 05:57.804
May God save
us all, cousin.

05:57.806 --> 05:58.805
Edmund.

05:58.807 --> 06:00.166
Did they hurt you?

06:00.168 --> 06:02.128
I would have killed
them if I could.

06:02.130 --> 06:04.090
<i>Come on.
That's enough.</i>

06:04.092 --> 06:06.294
Come away.

06:11.019 --> 06:13.021
<i>Come on, you.</i>

06:22.711 --> 06:24.231
- My lady?
- Come with me.

06:24.233 --> 06:26.235
Come with me.

06:28.117 --> 06:30.677
H-help, uh...
Take his arms.

06:30.679 --> 06:33.202
- What? Is he...
- Uh, help me to move him.

06:35.364 --> 06:37.486
Uh, move...
Move this...

06:42.892 --> 06:43.891
Take him.

06:48.258 --> 06:49.577
- Oh!
- My lady,

06:49.579 --> 06:51.179
what are we going to do
with the king?

06:51.181 --> 06:52.620
- Take him!
- But...

06:52.622 --> 06:56.384
We'll just take him,
put him onto the...

06:58.308 --> 07:00.310
Yes, yes.

07:06.356 --> 07:08.358
Get his feet
up on the...

07:11.521 --> 07:13.401
I will, uh,
s-summon the royal physician.

07:13.403 --> 07:14.442
No. Eat this.

07:14.444 --> 07:15.964
- No, I ca... I...
- Eat it!

07:15.966 --> 07:16.965
I don't understand.

07:16.967 --> 07:18.807
No, just eat it.

07:18.809 --> 07:23.011
You must get him into his light
shirt, get him into bed.

07:23.013 --> 07:25.013
Uh, His Grace
ate his breakfast,

07:25.015 --> 07:27.015
but his stomach
was upset,

07:27.017 --> 07:29.218
<i>and he...
he needs to rest,</i>

07:29.220 --> 07:32.183
and he must not be
disturbed by anybody.

07:35.786 --> 07:39.388
My lady, the king is dead.

07:39.390 --> 07:41.392
<i>Why would we
not announce it?</i>

07:47.518 --> 07:50.682
The king is Harry.

08:03.815 --> 08:05.735
<i>You.</i>

08:05.737 --> 08:07.739
Take this.

08:09.701 --> 08:11.703
Dispose of it.

08:21.273 --> 08:25.235
Take this to Prince Harry,
into his hands only.

08:25.237 --> 08:27.237
- My lady.
- He must return at once.

08:38.851 --> 08:40.291
John.

08:41.734 --> 08:43.736
<i>Sí.</i>

08:46.219 --> 08:48.221
<i>Sí.</i>

08:57.671 --> 08:59.230
Send word for Dudley.

08:59.232 --> 09:01.635
I need to see him here.

09:03.917 --> 09:05.919
I will have
that Spanish whore...

09:07.120 --> 09:08.880
And I will write

09:08.882 --> 09:11.403
that Princess Eleanor
must come at once

09:11.405 --> 09:13.407
<i>and wed Prince Harry.</i>

09:14.328 --> 09:16.330
Why are you
still here? Go.

09:19.653 --> 09:21.773
I'll write to Eleanor.

09:21.775 --> 09:23.777
She must come...

09:25.099 --> 09:26.618
<i>I spoke to the warden</i>

09:26.620 --> 09:28.220
<i>and told him
God would judge him</i>

09:28.222 --> 09:30.544
<i>if he did not move you
to a better cell.</i>

09:36.711 --> 09:38.833
It will not be
for long, Maggie.

09:40.515 --> 09:41.674
<i>Mother.</i>

09:41.676 --> 09:43.916
Oh, Henry.
Thank God.

09:43.918 --> 09:45.878
Come, Ursula.
Come. Let's see

09:45.880 --> 09:48.002
what we can spy
from this window.

10:01.336 --> 10:03.338
This was Teddy's cell...

10:05.460 --> 10:06.860
12 long years.

10:06.862 --> 10:09.783
Maggie, I give you
my solemn promise

10:09.785 --> 10:11.985
I will see you
freed from here,

10:11.987 --> 10:13.827
and you will have
your Reggie back.

10:13.829 --> 10:16.510
You have no power,
Catherine.

10:16.512 --> 10:20.674
You're at the mercy of that
woman, Lady Margaret.

10:20.676 --> 10:23.277
It was she who locked
my brother in here,

10:23.279 --> 10:25.559
and she murdered
two young boys before him.

10:25.561 --> 10:29.123
They received no mercy,
and nor will we.

10:29.125 --> 10:30.764
<i>There is nothing
you can do.</i>

10:30.766 --> 10:34.088
There is always
something, Maggie.

10:34.090 --> 10:35.329
<i>Ya basta.</i>

10:35.331 --> 10:37.651
Hold fast.

10:37.653 --> 10:39.816
I promise
I will not fail you.

10:47.984 --> 10:49.664
Lina, highness,

10:49.666 --> 10:55.031
I come to tell you I...
I think the king is dead.

10:56.353 --> 10:57.352
Dead?

10:57.354 --> 10:58.833
There was much blood,

10:58.835 --> 11:02.997
and Lady Margaret,
she is like a lion in a cage.

11:02.999 --> 11:07.562
She sends word for Harry
to come to Westminster now.

11:07.564 --> 11:09.164
But, highness, the guards,

11:09.166 --> 11:11.206
they have been told
to throw you from the palace.

11:11.208 --> 11:12.928
It is not safe
for you to return.

11:12.930 --> 11:15.650
Then I will ride to Harry and
intercept him on the road.

11:15.652 --> 11:18.734
There is only one road to
the city from the north.

11:49.567 --> 11:51.567
Who is it?

11:51.569 --> 11:53.571
<i>Dudley.</i>

12:00.098 --> 12:02.298
I didn't send for you.

12:02.300 --> 12:05.061
Eh, the king
didn't send for you.

12:05.063 --> 12:06.703
My lady,
the king's mother,

12:06.705 --> 12:09.666
sh-should we fetch the...
the king's physician?

12:09.668 --> 12:10.947
Is he unwell?

12:23.842 --> 12:25.482
In the name of our Lord,
Jesus Christ,

12:25.484 --> 12:27.164
what has happened here?

12:27.166 --> 12:29.847
The king has taken his
rightful place at God's side.

12:29.849 --> 12:32.930
<i>Now, we must
work quickly.</i>

12:32.932 --> 12:36.213
These ledgers detail
lands and chattels

12:36.215 --> 12:39.216
that the Crown has
seized in lieu of taxes.

12:39.218 --> 12:42.580
But Parliament refused to ratify
that lands could be forfeit.

12:42.582 --> 12:45.102
The landowners can repurchase
their confiscated lands

12:45.104 --> 12:46.304
at the prices
written down.

12:46.306 --> 12:48.388
He doesn't need
to see the prices.

12:51.711 --> 12:55.633
This is against the law.
It... it is thievery.

12:55.635 --> 12:56.834
What were you thinking?

12:56.836 --> 12:58.316
Don't play the innocent,
Wiltshire.

12:58.318 --> 13:00.598
Every member of the privy
council knew that...

13:00.600 --> 13:02.520
Knew the treasury
was short of funds, yes,

13:02.522 --> 13:04.442
and... and I sang
with the chorus,

13:04.444 --> 13:09.648
but this is some secret song
that you both sang.

13:09.650 --> 13:11.770
Did the king know of this?

13:11.772 --> 13:14.613
<i>The issue is
that these must be disposed of.</i>

13:14.615 --> 13:16.935
Prince Harry must be
safely back in the palace

13:16.937 --> 13:19.217
before the country learns
that the king is dead.

13:19.219 --> 13:21.660
If news leaks out,
there could be a rebellion.

13:21.662 --> 13:23.702
He could be
torn apart by a mob.

13:23.704 --> 13:26.825
I must see my grandson
on the throne!

13:26.827 --> 13:28.627
It is the will of God.

13:28.629 --> 13:30.669
I shall take these
to my home

13:30.671 --> 13:34.313
until you instruct me
what to do with them.

13:34.315 --> 13:35.834
What of the king?

13:35.836 --> 13:37.556
<i>He has been sent for.</i>

13:37.558 --> 13:41.160
No, this king,
our beloved monarch.

13:41.162 --> 13:44.724
He cannot be suffered to languish
in his own bloody bedding.

13:44.726 --> 13:46.728
The king sleeps...

13:47.689 --> 13:49.691
until I say otherwise.

15:16.460 --> 15:19.261
- Sir, please, just a little...
- No.

15:19.263 --> 15:21.265
Go.

15:22.626 --> 15:23.905
Good day.

15:23.907 --> 15:25.948
Nothing good about it,
Saracen.

15:37.121 --> 15:39.081
I am sorry.

15:39.083 --> 15:41.724
I have asked
too much of you.

15:41.726 --> 15:44.006
At every turn,
you have been loyal to me,

15:44.008 --> 15:46.851
and you are loyal
as a soldier, too, and...

15:50.655 --> 15:53.416
Lina, I may go to war.

15:53.418 --> 15:55.420
When I return...

15:57.062 --> 15:58.381
I ask you this...

15:58.383 --> 16:00.703
that you will pledge
yourself to me

16:00.705 --> 16:05.270
and our new family
ahead of her.

16:13.719 --> 16:18.642
The king is dead.

16:18.644 --> 16:20.764
He is in his bed.

16:20.766 --> 16:22.646
My lady, the council
needs to know

16:22.648 --> 16:24.408
that illegal taxes
have been levied...

16:24.410 --> 16:26.410
The good people
of England

16:26.412 --> 16:29.733
have been overburdened
by taxation.

16:29.735 --> 16:31.975
They have
been sorely used

16:31.977 --> 16:35.899
by the nobility
and the Crown.

16:35.901 --> 16:41.385
But you said the treasury needed
gold and that we were to find it.

16:41.387 --> 16:43.908
Our new king
may not understand

16:43.910 --> 16:46.671
the measures that were
taken by his council.

16:46.673 --> 16:49.393
<i>He may seek
to apportion blame</i>

16:49.395 --> 16:52.276
<i>so that his reign is
not tainted with it.</i>

16:52.278 --> 16:54.919
I always said
these taxes were immoral.

16:54.921 --> 16:57.562
Did you?
Did you whisper it?

16:57.564 --> 17:00.365
I said it loudly.
Maybe you did not listen, Stafford!

17:00.367 --> 17:02.687
No, I rarely listen to what
you have to say, butcher's boy.

17:02.689 --> 17:04.969
You don't even have
the rank to sit amongst us.

17:04.971 --> 17:07.092
<i>I agreed that the
treasury needed aid,</i>

17:07.094 --> 17:08.772
but Parliament
refused to pass

17:08.775 --> 17:11.016
an act where lands and
property could be confiscated,

17:11.018 --> 17:14.339
yet only yesterday I learned
that Dudley and my lady

17:14.340 --> 17:17.222
and perhaps the king
himself defied Parliament

17:17.223 --> 17:19.184
and seized men's homes
and chattels anyway.

17:19.185 --> 17:21.146
- Dudley.
- <i>There were ledgers</i>

17:21.147 --> 17:22.988
in the king's room detailing
hundreds of seized properties.

17:22.990 --> 17:26.271
<i>Dudley
engineered the plan alone.</i>

17:26.272 --> 17:28.073
He and the king
had knowledge of it.

17:28.075 --> 17:29.995
We did not.

17:29.997 --> 17:32.277
The evidence is all
with Dudley, in his house,

17:32.279 --> 17:36.201
so we must move quickly
to convict him.

17:36.203 --> 17:39.207
<i>All of our hands
are clean of this.</i>

17:41.409 --> 17:43.411
Guard.

17:55.543 --> 17:57.545
Who are they?

17:59.307 --> 18:01.309
Oviedo.

18:15.924 --> 18:18.445
God save the king.

18:18.447 --> 18:20.247
What is this?

18:20.249 --> 18:23.532
Your father passed into
God's mercy, Your Grace.

18:25.414 --> 18:27.054
- <i>God save the king.</i>
- <i>God save the king.</i>

18:27.056 --> 18:28.936
- <i>God save the king.</i>
- <i>God save the king.</i>

18:28.938 --> 18:30.940
<i>God save the king.</i>

18:44.474 --> 18:47.515
Charlie, wine.

18:47.517 --> 18:50.240
Yes, Your Grace.

19:13.463 --> 19:14.422
<i>Dudley!</i>

19:14.424 --> 19:16.545
<i>Keep walking.</i>

19:16.547 --> 19:17.906
<i>I have done nothing wrong.</i>

19:17.908 --> 19:19.387
<i>I have known Prince Harry,</i>

19:19.389 --> 19:21.392
<i>our new king,
since he was a boy.</i>

19:22.433 --> 19:25.033
<i>Wait. I must send a message
to Lady Margaret.</i>

19:25.035 --> 19:27.436
<i>This is an error
that can be remedied.</i>

19:27.438 --> 19:29.318
Then Henry is dead.

19:29.320 --> 19:31.322
<i>Will it help us?</i>

19:45.096 --> 19:48.137
I always knew I'd be king,

19:48.139 --> 19:51.180
ever since I was a boy.

19:51.182 --> 19:55.945
Arthur was groomed for it,
but I felt it,

19:55.947 --> 19:59.469
like a silver thread
pulling me towards this day.

19:59.471 --> 20:02.113
Your grandmother
felt that thread, too.

20:03.595 --> 20:05.597
I am the tangled knot
in it.

20:07.078 --> 20:09.081
What a pair
of poets we make.

20:10.762 --> 20:13.883
Though my father never liked
my writing or my songs.

20:13.885 --> 20:16.526
Or your taste in girls.

20:16.528 --> 20:19.129
No.

20:19.131 --> 20:21.133
No, that was
my grandmother.

20:22.695 --> 20:24.697
I am told you are
to marry my niece.

20:26.098 --> 20:30.180
I thought it best to...
to remove myself from court

20:30.182 --> 20:31.942
to pray upon my duty.

20:31.944 --> 20:34.905
In truth, I was...
I was grateful for the peace.

20:34.907 --> 20:37.147
Peace from me?

20:37.149 --> 20:38.349
Peace from my heart.

20:38.351 --> 20:40.713
And is your heart
at peace?

20:42.675 --> 20:46.277
Do you think of me,
or is your heart

20:46.279 --> 20:48.281
now with the
Princess Eleanor?

20:53.766 --> 20:55.769
<i>Good day.</i>

21:00.453 --> 21:02.576
Good day, mistress,
my lord.

21:04.778 --> 21:06.578
Wait.

21:06.580 --> 21:08.582
<i>Here. Take this.</i>

21:09.663 --> 21:11.423
Buy ale,
and raise a glass

21:11.425 --> 21:13.827
to the king of England,
and save his soul.

21:25.079 --> 21:29.123
No matter which backside is on the
throne, nothing has changed.

21:32.286 --> 21:34.288
So you are
not for Eleanor?

21:38.893 --> 21:41.413
Harry, I...

21:41.415 --> 21:46.018
Harry,
I need to tell you I love you.

21:46.020 --> 21:49.141
I cannot offer you
the Habsburg empire,

21:49.143 --> 21:51.264
nor the sanction
of your grandmother,

21:51.266 --> 21:54.267
and if I cannot
love you as your wife,

21:54.269 --> 21:56.911
then I will try to
love you as a subject.

21:59.794 --> 22:01.917
But I want to love you
as a wife...

22:03.638 --> 22:05.640
and as the mother
of your heirs...

22:06.401 --> 22:08.483
and as a lover
in your bed.

22:11.807 --> 22:14.249
Harry, tell me
what my fate shall be.

22:16.131 --> 22:17.731
I am not Harry anymore.

22:17.733 --> 22:19.733
I'm Henry.

22:19.735 --> 22:25.659
You and I, Catherine,
we do not fear the morrow,

22:25.661 --> 22:29.663
but we make it...

22:29.665 --> 22:34.670
as... as man
or king and wife.

22:46.442 --> 22:48.202
I never wanted Eleanor.

22:48.204 --> 22:51.365
I told my father that.
I told your father, too.

22:51.367 --> 22:54.649
I withdrew from the match
two days ago.

22:54.651 --> 22:57.093
I refused her for your sake.

22:59.616 --> 23:03.420
All we need's a letter from the
pope, and then we shall wed.

23:19.356 --> 23:20.996
<i>Dudley, you'll come with us.</i>

23:20.998 --> 23:22.798
<i>Good. Yes. Hah.</i>

23:22.800 --> 23:26.521
My lady, the king's mother
will see me now, yes?

23:26.523 --> 23:28.526
<i>This matter can be resolved.</i>

23:33.651 --> 23:35.653
Wait!

23:36.173 --> 23:37.172
My gracious lady!

23:39.697 --> 23:40.856
You are devout!

23:40.858 --> 23:42.298
Please don't
let them do this!

23:42.300 --> 23:43.739
I've done
nothing wrong!

23:43.741 --> 23:46.942
My lady!

23:46.944 --> 23:47.984
Please!

23:47.986 --> 23:49.785
- <i>"Edmund Dudley..."</i>
- Christ!

23:49.787 --> 23:52.268
"you stand guilty
of constructive treason,

23:52.270 --> 23:55.551
"a crime of
imprisoning the king,

23:55.553 --> 23:58.634
"insomuch as through
your legislative advice

23:58.636 --> 24:01.277
<i>"to his grace,
King Henry VII,</i>

24:01.279 --> 24:03.479
<i>"you did
ensnare him unwittingly</i>

24:03.481 --> 24:06.723
<i>"to enforce illegal
acts of taxation</i>

24:06.725 --> 24:10.286
"and, in so doing,
did defile the crown

24:10.288 --> 24:15.372
and the holy ordinance of God
under which all kings do serve."

24:15.374 --> 24:17.376
I did your bidding.

24:18.697 --> 24:21.738
<i>I did your bidding!</i>

24:21.740 --> 24:24.821
<i>No! I am
an innocent man!</i>

24:24.823 --> 24:27.584
<i>I took my instruction
from you!</i>

24:27.586 --> 24:29.586
<i>I did it all
for England!</i>

24:29.588 --> 24:33.150
<i>You cannot treat me like
some dog to be put down!</i>

24:33.152 --> 24:34.832
<i>It is un-Christian.</i>

24:34.834 --> 24:36.954
"The detail of your crimes
have been examined

24:36.956 --> 24:39.599
during an extraordinary
session of council."

24:42.441 --> 24:44.964
The sentence of death
has been passed.

24:46.766 --> 24:48.366
God grant you mercy.

24:48.368 --> 24:50.167
<i>Where is my trial?</i>

24:50.169 --> 24:52.410
This is not justice!

24:52.412 --> 24:53.491
Please!

24:53.493 --> 24:54.652
My lady!

24:54.654 --> 24:56.534
<i>No!</i>

24:56.536 --> 24:59.177
<i>God save King Henry!</i>

24:59.179 --> 25:01.579
I am his loyal servant!

25:01.581 --> 25:03.581
God save him!

25:03.583 --> 25:04.662
Aah!

25:04.664 --> 25:06.905
<i>Fuck you all!</i>

25:06.907 --> 25:11.469
Fuck you all in hell!

25:11.471 --> 25:12.791
Aah!

25:12.793 --> 25:16.917
Fuck you all in hell!

25:44.425 --> 25:47.867
The bells will peal
for King Henry's death.

25:47.869 --> 25:50.269
Let it be known
that the traitor

25:50.271 --> 25:54.233
responsible for the
people's yoke of taxation

25:54.235 --> 25:56.638
has been executed.

26:27.269 --> 26:28.949
Long live the king.

26:28.951 --> 26:31.632
Long live the king.

26:31.634 --> 26:35.516
Banners will be lowered to
half-station for my father.

26:35.518 --> 26:37.520
Do it now.

26:48.451 --> 26:51.895
Princess Catherine
is to be your queen.

26:53.376 --> 26:55.378
Be sure
the palace knows it.

26:58.141 --> 26:59.941
If it pleases
Your Grace,

26:59.943 --> 27:01.743
I ask that Lady Pole
and her children

27:01.745 --> 27:03.665
be released
from the Tower.

27:03.667 --> 27:05.146
They are
loyal to you.

27:05.148 --> 27:06.708
If my father
had them arrested,

27:06.710 --> 27:08.470
there must
have been a reason.

27:08.472 --> 27:10.592
We will hear mass
for his soul,

27:10.594 --> 27:12.594
and then we will announce
our wedding.

28:07.092 --> 28:09.094
Your Grace...

28:10.375 --> 28:13.697
this is a time of great
distress and sadness,

28:13.699 --> 28:17.941
but you should know
of an unseemly justice

28:17.943 --> 28:20.944
that was meted out
as you rode back to London.

28:20.946 --> 28:23.667
Edmund Dudley was
engaged to collect

28:23.669 --> 28:26.031
additional levies
for the crown.

28:29.755 --> 28:31.034
My lady, the king's mo...

28:31.036 --> 28:34.360
Uh, my lady,
the king is here.

28:40.726 --> 28:44.168
<i>It was criminal,
not to mention a stain against the Crown.</i>

28:45.892 --> 28:47.894
Lady Grandmother.

28:54.260 --> 28:56.621
Your Grace,
God preserve you.

28:56.623 --> 29:00.024
Your father
has ascended into Heaven

29:00.026 --> 29:02.789
and you
to your rightful throne.

29:06.833 --> 29:08.633
We should speak in private.

29:08.635 --> 29:11.678
I am in vigil
at my father's side.

29:17.804 --> 29:19.805
Princess Eleanor
has been summoned.

29:19.807 --> 29:21.566
Good.

29:21.568 --> 29:23.608
She can attend my wedding
to Princess Catherine.

29:23.610 --> 29:26.571
Harry, you're shocked,
and you're grieving,

29:26.573 --> 29:29.454
but you pledged
to your father

29:29.456 --> 29:31.937
that you would marry Princess
Eleanor for the good of England.

29:31.939 --> 29:35.260
Was it grief...

29:35.262 --> 29:39.104
that led you
to arrest, try,

29:39.106 --> 29:41.827
and behead Edmund Dudley
all in one day?

29:41.829 --> 29:43.549
Oh, no. That's right.

29:43.551 --> 29:45.553
He didn't have a trial.

29:48.997 --> 29:54.160
Your father learned
that Edmund Dudley

29:54.162 --> 29:58.805
had been implementing taxes that
were not agreed by Parliament,

29:58.807 --> 30:01.688
and he gave the order
to arrest him.

30:01.690 --> 30:03.692
No.

30:04.973 --> 30:08.374
My father
was already dead.

30:08.376 --> 30:10.378
You had him arrested...

30:12.100 --> 30:14.783
and then you silenced him
before I could return.

30:17.065 --> 30:22.549
You took it upon yourself
to act as regent.

30:22.551 --> 30:24.551
Why such haste,
Lady Grandmother?

30:24.553 --> 30:26.913
Harry, please.

30:26.915 --> 30:28.918
Be with
your father now.

30:37.046 --> 30:39.647
What was my cousin
Maggie's crime?

30:39.649 --> 30:42.530
Well, she... she was
a traitor to the Crown.

30:42.532 --> 30:44.452
She wrote to Edmund
de la Pool to ask him...

30:44.454 --> 30:45.653
He is her cousin.

30:45.655 --> 30:48.816
<i>You took away
all hope from her.</i>

30:48.818 --> 30:50.738
Her husband dead,
her children starving,

30:50.740 --> 30:54.342
can you be surprised
that she was angry?

30:54.344 --> 30:58.348
If you had had your way,
you would have crushed me, too.

31:00.830 --> 31:03.671
Lady Pole would
never harm you, Harry.

31:03.673 --> 31:06.394
She has been a friend
to me and to you, too.

31:06.396 --> 31:08.556
She's a traitor.

31:08.558 --> 31:13.443
Please, release her
and her children.

31:16.366 --> 31:18.126
<i>If nothing else,</i>

31:18.128 --> 31:19.808
make this your
wedding gift to me.

31:19.810 --> 31:23.051
<i>You cannot marry,
not without a papal dispensation,</i>

31:23.053 --> 31:26.375
and the pope has not seen fit
to grant one for this marriage.

31:26.377 --> 31:28.379
He has refused...

31:29.780 --> 31:31.782
or he is
still deciding?

31:42.473 --> 31:45.634
Send a pardon to the Tower
for Lady Margaret Pole

31:45.636 --> 31:47.476
with my seal on it.

31:47.478 --> 31:51.000
<i>I will take it to her.</i>

31:51.002 --> 31:53.605
Thank you,
Your Grace.

32:04.816 --> 32:07.257
How did she
find the prince so quickly?

32:07.259 --> 32:10.542
The Moor bowman,
he rode in with them.

33:24.258 --> 33:29.101
It works!
The baby comes.

33:40.234 --> 33:42.236
Henry.

34:23.478 --> 34:25.518
I said that I
would free you.

34:25.521 --> 34:27.360
A pardon,
from the new King Henry.

34:28.924 --> 34:32.286
You may return to court
with all your children.

34:32.288 --> 34:34.648
You will be
looked after.

35:00.877 --> 35:03.398
Mm, mm, mm, mm, mm.

35:03.400 --> 35:05.880
I must ready
to march out.

35:05.882 --> 35:07.642
The sergeant-at-arms
is generous,

35:07.644 --> 35:10.565
but, uh, soon,
he kick my arse.

35:12.289 --> 35:14.291
- I must go, too.
- Mm.

35:23.420 --> 35:24.419
<i>Oviedo.</i>

35:24.421 --> 35:26.181
Yes, sir.

35:26.183 --> 35:27.462
<i>My Lady?</i>

35:27.464 --> 35:29.264
A prayer book
has been stolen from me.

35:29.266 --> 35:30.706
I believe
this man took it.

35:30.708 --> 35:32.468
- What do you mean?
- Oviedo does not steal.

35:32.470 --> 35:34.472
Please,
search his belongings.

35:48.246 --> 35:51.007
I believe you'll find an
inscription on the facing page.

35:51.009 --> 35:54.570
It is from the pope
himself to me.

35:54.572 --> 35:55.932
Can you explain this?

35:55.934 --> 35:57.613
This is a mistake.
My lady,

35:57.615 --> 35:59.936
you gave this book
to me as a gift.

35:59.938 --> 36:01.377
He showed it
to me.

36:01.379 --> 36:03.099
You're a Saracen and
an enemy of Christ.

36:03.101 --> 36:04.861
Why would I give
God's word to you?

36:04.863 --> 36:06.022
- I steal nothing!
- Watch your tongue.

36:06.024 --> 36:07.103
In English law,
the punishment

36:07.105 --> 36:08.505
for stealing
is to be hanged.

36:08.507 --> 36:09.906
Is that what you wish?

36:09.908 --> 36:11.347
<i>It is the law.
See that it is done.</i>

36:11.349 --> 36:12.589
- All right. Take him.
- No, this is wrong.

36:12.591 --> 36:14.070
You can't do this!

36:14.072 --> 36:16.192
- What are you doing?
- My lady,

36:16.194 --> 36:18.114
surely he should be given
the chance to speak.

36:18.116 --> 36:20.157
You have your orders,
Sergeant.

36:20.159 --> 36:22.319
My lady! My lady!

36:22.321 --> 36:24.281
Sergeant,
this is wrong!

36:24.283 --> 36:25.922
I am no thief!

36:25.924 --> 36:28.205
My lady! My lady!

36:28.207 --> 36:30.209
Lady Margaret.

36:32.131 --> 36:35.773
You gave that book of
prayers to him as a gift.

36:35.775 --> 36:38.816
He has been loyal to you.

36:38.818 --> 36:42.179
Perhaps you have forgotten
that you gave it to him.

36:42.181 --> 36:45.104
I'm sure
I could remember...

36:46.426 --> 36:48.746
if only you'd remember
that your Infanta

36:48.748 --> 36:50.748
and Prince Arthur
lay together.

36:50.750 --> 36:54.672
Even now?

36:54.674 --> 36:57.435
Even now, you would
destroy her happiness?

36:57.437 --> 37:00.638
She cannot marry anyway,
not without the pope,

37:00.640 --> 37:02.961
and he is
not forthcoming.

37:02.963 --> 37:06.444
Then why do this,
if they cannot wed?

37:06.446 --> 37:08.086
So you refuse?

37:08.088 --> 37:10.208
Then he will hang.

37:10.210 --> 37:11.209
I will go to Catherine.

37:11.211 --> 37:13.171
She will save him.

37:13.173 --> 37:15.013
Guards!

37:15.015 --> 37:16.534
Let me go to her!

37:16.536 --> 37:18.016
Eject her
from the palace,

37:18.018 --> 37:19.457
and do not let her
back inside.

37:19.459 --> 37:23.263
No. No! Wait!

37:45.126 --> 37:47.528
They lay together.

37:49.290 --> 37:52.093
Your Infanta
is no virgin.

37:53.414 --> 37:55.655
No.

37:55.657 --> 37:59.659
She deceived us to trick
my Harry into marriage.

37:59.661 --> 38:01.501
Please, release him.

38:01.503 --> 38:04.065
Swear on this holy cross.

38:13.235 --> 38:18.640
She lied so she
could wed Prince Harry.

38:22.084 --> 38:24.086
At last,
you tell the truth.

38:26.128 --> 38:28.568
Eject her
from the palace.

38:28.570 --> 38:32.575
No!
You will pardon him!

38:46.469 --> 38:47.588
Did you speak to her?

38:47.590 --> 38:50.393
Oviedo,
she has lost her wits.

38:52.115 --> 38:54.555
I want to be your wife.

38:54.557 --> 38:56.277
<i>Now.</i>

38:56.279 --> 38:58.239
Please, Oviedo.

38:58.241 --> 38:59.841
<i>Let her through.</i>

38:59.843 --> 39:02.205
Lina, eh...

39:09.452 --> 39:12.776
You are
everything to me.

39:14.538 --> 39:16.660
We will have
your Muslim service.

39:20.784 --> 39:22.786
No.

39:25.629 --> 39:28.672
We marry Catholic...

39:30.114 --> 39:31.793
for you.

39:31.795 --> 39:33.798
Then both.

39:43.127 --> 39:45.129
Is my lady,
Lina, back yet?

39:48.332 --> 39:50.335
No, my lady.

39:52.657 --> 39:54.659
Would you dress me?

40:10.155 --> 40:13.879
Reggie,
I have come for you.

40:20.325 --> 40:22.165
We can be
a family again,

40:22.167 --> 40:25.130
you and me and
Ursula and Henry.

40:26.372 --> 40:28.414
Please, Reggie,
come with me.

40:30.496 --> 40:33.098
I love you very much.

40:35.020 --> 40:36.700
Look.

40:36.702 --> 40:38.704
Look what
I've brought you.

40:44.831 --> 40:46.833
Please, Reggie.

40:47.633 --> 40:49.635
I am your mother.

40:57.283 --> 40:59.964
I will return tomorrow.

40:59.966 --> 41:01.968
<i>Perhaps
he needs more time.</i>

42:07.596 --> 42:09.075
I, for one,
question the measures

42:09.077 --> 42:10.356
implemented
by this man, Dudley...

42:10.358 --> 42:11.878
Oh, as I recall,
you were in favor...

42:11.880 --> 42:13.359
Silence!

42:13.361 --> 42:15.364
All of you.

42:16.325 --> 42:18.687
You are like
a room full of bees.

42:23.372 --> 42:24.731
Woolsey,

42:24.733 --> 42:27.256
<i>why don't you buzz
like the rest of them?</i>

42:29.018 --> 42:31.899
Because I know my guilt,
Your Grace.

42:31.901 --> 42:34.661
<i>I knew the levies were
unjust, but I did nothing,</i>

42:34.663 --> 42:36.463
because I wished
to curry favor

42:36.465 --> 42:39.588
with the king
and with his mother.

42:41.631 --> 42:43.991
As we all did.

42:45.314 --> 42:47.875
I should hang
the lot of you.

42:47.877 --> 42:49.877
Spoken like
a true king, Harry.

42:49.879 --> 42:53.521
And you should start by casting
out that harlot from the palace.

42:53.523 --> 42:55.202
- Leave.
- Her closest lady

42:55.204 --> 42:56.964
swears on
the holy cross

42:56.966 --> 42:59.807
that her marriage to your
brother was a full one,

42:59.809 --> 43:02.570
consummated daily over
many, many months.

43:02.572 --> 43:03.651
Leave us!

43:03.653 --> 43:04.892
She is no maid.

43:04.894 --> 43:07.535
She is a liar and
a fortune hunter.

43:07.537 --> 43:09.017
She cannot be
your queen.

43:09.019 --> 43:11.021
It is
against God's law.

43:12.542 --> 43:14.863
You brought evil
to this great house

43:14.865 --> 43:16.504
<i>the day
you came here,</i>

43:16.506 --> 43:18.506
but you will not
drag us into ruin.

43:18.508 --> 43:19.628
This is a lie.

43:19.630 --> 43:21.309
Lina did not say this,

43:21.311 --> 43:22.831
because it isn't true.

43:22.833 --> 43:25.233
Where is this woman?

43:25.235 --> 43:26.915
Well, fetch her here,

43:26.917 --> 43:29.760
and have her swear it
on the cross before me.

43:32.243 --> 43:34.245
Bring her to me!

43:39.850 --> 43:41.852
Where is she now?

43:43.614 --> 43:44.894
What have you done to her?

43:44.896 --> 43:46.898
- Uh...
- Guards!

44:19.932 --> 44:21.934
I'm sorry...

44:23.896 --> 44:24.895
but it's time to go.

44:24.897 --> 44:26.899
No.

44:27.740 --> 44:30.621
Don't take him.

44:30.623 --> 44:32.625
Please.

44:34.867 --> 44:36.787
<i>No!</i>

44:36.789 --> 44:38.268
<i>Oviedo!</i>

44:38.270 --> 44:39.790
Oviedo! Please!

44:39.792 --> 44:41.872
We'll make it
as quick as we can.

44:41.874 --> 44:43.874
He has done
nothing wrong.

44:43.876 --> 44:45.796
<i>I am a lady of the future
queen of England.</i>

44:45.798 --> 44:48.078
You cannot do this!

44:48.080 --> 44:50.083
Keep her here.

44:56.729 --> 44:58.609
<i>Pl-please.</i>

44:58.611 --> 45:00.812
<i>Please, no.</i>

45:07.020 --> 45:08.499
<i>Adios, amor de mi vida.</i>

45:08.501 --> 45:10.101
<i>Try and make it quick.</i>

45:10.103 --> 45:11.342
No!

45:11.344 --> 45:12.984
I beg you, please!

45:12.986 --> 45:15.026
Please, no!

45:16.069 --> 45:17.949
Please, no!

45:17.951 --> 45:20.234
<i>No!</i>

45:22.756 --> 45:24.876
Oviedo!

45:30.444 --> 45:31.443
No!

45:31.445 --> 45:33.085
Stop it!

45:33.087 --> 45:35.089
- Cut him down!
- Do it!

45:39.333 --> 45:41.335
Oviedo.

45:42.336 --> 45:44.338
What in God's name
happened here?

45:45.700 --> 45:47.702
Who ordered this?!

46:13.809 --> 46:15.608
Oviedo is released.

46:15.610 --> 46:19.212
The Saracen stole
a book of hours from me.

46:19.214 --> 46:20.734
He's a criminal.

46:20.736 --> 46:22.736
Why would he steal a
Catholic book of prayers?

46:22.738 --> 46:25.018
He does not even share your faith.
He is Muslim.

46:25.020 --> 46:27.060
This has no bearing
on what her lady,

46:27.062 --> 46:29.423
Lina de Cardonnes,
confessed to me,

46:29.425 --> 46:31.985
that she lay
with your brother.

46:31.987 --> 46:34.430
I would have thought
it has every bearing.

46:35.671 --> 46:37.151
There's not
an instrument of torture

46:37.153 --> 46:38.632
in the Tower
that could extract

46:38.634 --> 46:40.834
a false confession
any quicker.

46:40.836 --> 46:42.838
There'll be no wedding.

46:45.321 --> 46:47.842
You do not have
the dispensation.

47:10.066 --> 47:12.947
I thought
I had lost you.

47:15.792 --> 47:18.275
You...

47:21.638 --> 47:24.079
You should attend
to the Infanta's wedding.

47:24.081 --> 47:25.921
She cannot wed.

47:25.923 --> 47:27.925
The pope
has not approved it.

47:29.727 --> 47:31.687
- But he has.
- No.

47:31.689 --> 47:33.408
Lady Margaret paid me

47:33.410 --> 47:36.211
to read all the letters
at the ports.

47:36.213 --> 47:39.457
The pope gave his
permission many weeks ago.

47:40.698 --> 47:44.260
I gave these letters
to Lady Margaret.

47:45.263 --> 47:48.584
Hey. No crying.

47:48.586 --> 47:51.829
You must go and tell
the Infanta that she may wed.

47:55.673 --> 47:58.314
Lady Grandmother,
the pope has confirmed

47:58.316 --> 48:00.396
that he sent a dispensation
for my wedding.

48:00.398 --> 48:03.680
I must assume
that his first communication

48:03.682 --> 48:06.202
on the subject was lost

48:06.204 --> 48:08.725
- or destroyed.
- I-

48:08.727 --> 48:10.647
<i>We choose to
have a private wedding</i>

48:10.649 --> 48:14.290
in the Church of the
Observant Friars in Greenwich.

48:14.292 --> 48:15.372
You will not attend.

48:17.776 --> 48:19.778
Harry, no.

48:22.821 --> 48:24.823
I've been
a mother to you.

48:25.624 --> 48:27.664
I educated you.

48:27.666 --> 48:29.949
I empowered you.

48:32.751 --> 48:34.753
I loved you.

48:39.198 --> 48:41.200
Come, Catherine.

50:52.535 --> 50:54.537
My queen.

50:57.820 --> 50:59.260
<i>Maid!</i>

50:59.262 --> 51:01.943
<i>I'm thirsty!</i>

51:01.945 --> 51:04.065
<i>Maid!</i>

51:04.067 --> 51:06.069
<i>Maid!</i>

51:20.844 --> 51:22.924
Are you a fever?

51:22.926 --> 51:25.367
No. I am here.

51:25.369 --> 51:27.371
To laugh at me.

51:29.213 --> 51:32.254
Well, laugh away.

51:32.256 --> 51:36.658
My children are all here
with me for the wedding,

51:36.660 --> 51:39.023
but Reggie chooses
not to speak.

51:40.304 --> 51:42.787
That is the final gift
you've given me.

51:45.109 --> 51:46.348
Water.

51:58.283 --> 52:01.326
I think I know
more of God than you do.

52:13.538 --> 52:15.338
Ah.

52:15.340 --> 52:17.620
My Harry.

52:17.622 --> 52:19.302
Harry dresses
for his wedding.

52:19.304 --> 52:22.746
No. The Spanish girl
will destroy us all.

52:22.748 --> 52:25.188
<i>If Harry marries her,</i>

52:25.190 --> 52:29.593
he's cursed,
no boys, no heirs.

52:29.595 --> 52:32.716
It's what his mother
said on her deathbed.

52:32.718 --> 52:35.401
You call my actions evil...

52:37.283 --> 52:41.925
but I'm protecting
my family, my country.

52:41.927 --> 52:44.568
It's a lonely path.

52:44.570 --> 52:45.930
I have to go.

52:45.932 --> 52:47.251
No.

52:47.253 --> 52:50.534
Everything I've built
will be undone.

52:50.536 --> 52:51.655
<i>What have you built,
though?</i>

52:51.657 --> 52:55.139
Hatred and fear.

52:55.141 --> 52:57.143
You are forsaken.

53:15.322 --> 53:17.684
<i>This arrived
today from Spain.</i>

53:26.693 --> 53:28.696
What is it?

53:30.658 --> 53:35.543
My father says that I should
know who I am marrying.

53:36.544 --> 53:40.786
<i>It wasn't Harry who refused
the match with Eleanor.</i>

53:40.788 --> 53:42.147
It was my father

53:42.149 --> 53:44.109
who withdrew
my niece's hand.

53:44.111 --> 53:46.113
<i>Why would he do that?</i>

53:47.875 --> 53:49.877
Because...

53:51.399 --> 53:53.479
Because my sister
told him

53:53.481 --> 53:55.843
that she herself
had lain with Harry.

54:06.574 --> 54:08.577
What?

54:13.021 --> 54:14.180
What are...

54:14.182 --> 54:15.261
No!

54:15.263 --> 54:17.023
No.

54:17.025 --> 54:19.466
No.

54:19.468 --> 54:22.951
Go away. Go away. Go away.

54:24.913 --> 54:26.915
Jasper.

54:28.197 --> 54:32.561
Take my soul
to the gates of Heaven.

54:38.407 --> 54:39.847
Jasper.

54:41.610 --> 54:43.813
Jasper.

54:49.699 --> 54:51.539
I didn't know.

54:51.541 --> 54:53.703
I didn't know.

55:29.620 --> 55:31.622
Catherine.

55:35.145 --> 55:37.148
I had a letter
from my father.

55:40.911 --> 55:42.913
My sister says...

55:44.515 --> 55:46.115
she says
you lay with her.

55:46.117 --> 55:48.397
What?

55:48.399 --> 55:50.401
<i>Is it true?</i>

55:51.322 --> 55:52.762
Of course it isn't.

55:52.764 --> 55:56.886
Catherine,
why would I have?

55:56.888 --> 56:00.249
I-I walked
through fire for you.

56:00.251 --> 56:02.894
I stood against my father,
risked my throne.

56:06.458 --> 56:10.982
I've said that we should
be crowned together. I...

56:13.865 --> 56:16.186
How could you
believe this of me?

56:16.188 --> 56:19.789
<i>If you believe your father
and your sister over me,</i>

56:19.791 --> 56:24.556
then everyone that stood
against us will have won.

56:26.358 --> 56:30.562
<i>Everything that we fought for will...
will be for nothing.</i>

56:32.725 --> 56:34.727
Then...

56:36.128 --> 56:38.531
you didn't touch
or lie with her?

56:41.253 --> 56:43.255
Of course I didn't.

56:50.583 --> 56:52.263
I'm sorry.

56:52.265 --> 56:55.108
I should have known my
sister would try to hurt me.

56:58.591 --> 57:00.593
Forgive me.

57:19.333 --> 57:21.335
Catherine.

57:24.898 --> 57:29.783
You didn't lie with Arthur
either, did you?

57:35.870 --> 57:37.872
No.

57:38.552 --> 57:41.353
As I have said,

57:41.355 --> 57:43.357
I am a maid.
