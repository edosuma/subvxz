00:02.085 --> 00:03.337
Previously on 90210:

00:03.378 --> 00:05.088
News flash-- Teddy Montgomery
is a major player.

00:05.130 --> 00:06.340
There's no need to worry.

00:06.381 --> 00:07.549
You just have to be
sensible, that's all.

00:07.591 --> 00:09.969
So check his e-mail,
monitor his cell phone

00:10.010 --> 00:11.178
and follow him occasionally.

00:11.219 --> 00:12.179
You spied on me?

00:12.220 --> 00:13.347
It's never going
to happen again.

00:13.388 --> 00:14.849
'Cause now I know
I can trust you.

00:14.890 --> 00:16.558
I need some space, okay?

00:16.600 --> 00:19.102
Hi, I'm Dana.
I'm Dixon's birth mom.

00:19.144 --> 00:21.689
My son's birth mother
has come to stay with us
for a little while.

00:21.730 --> 00:23.607
How's that going?
I think it's hard for him.

00:23.649 --> 00:25.066
I meant how is it
going for you?

00:25.108 --> 00:27.611
So all this anxiety
was for nothing, right?

00:27.653 --> 00:30.030
You know, everything I'm feeling
is valid, okay?

00:30.071 --> 00:31.615
Guys, where the hell
is my car?

00:31.657 --> 00:34.409
Who do you think got rid
of the one piece of evidence

00:34.451 --> 00:36.119
that's linking you
to my uncle's death?

00:36.161 --> 00:38.246
You like somebody,
and you haven't told me?

00:38.288 --> 00:41.082
The problem is... I like you.

00:54.221 --> 00:58.517
(car horn honking)

00:58.559 --> 01:00.519
(sighs): You mind?

01:00.561 --> 01:02.771
This space is occupied.

01:02.813 --> 01:03.814
Come on.

01:03.856 --> 01:05.482
It's the last one in the lot.

01:05.524 --> 01:07.108
(horn honking)
(sighs)

01:09.361 --> 01:10.946
(drumming on hood)

01:13.198 --> 01:14.449
(Liam chuckles)

01:19.621 --> 01:22.165
JASPER:
Annie, slow down.

01:22.207 --> 01:24.125
Look, I know that
you're freaked out

01:24.167 --> 01:25.794
over what I did, and I'm sorry.

01:25.836 --> 01:27.963
But you have to understand that
I was just trying to help you.

01:28.005 --> 01:29.965
I mean, I don't want anyone
to be able to link you

01:30.007 --> 01:32.009
to my uncle's death.
Just stop.

01:32.051 --> 01:35.846
You have to know I'll do
anything for you, anything.

01:35.888 --> 01:38.933
You really want
to do something for me?

01:38.974 --> 01:41.060
Just leave me alone.

01:50.986 --> 01:52.362
Okay, Blazers, listen up.

01:52.404 --> 01:54.155
I've got a really exciting
announcement to make.

01:54.197 --> 01:55.532
You guys are late.

01:55.574 --> 01:57.534
We have a new
faculty advisor--

01:57.576 --> 01:59.036
Mr. Cannon, everyone.

02:01.162 --> 02:03.791
Now, Mr. Cannon brings
some serious street
cred to the Blaze.

02:03.832 --> 02:05.709
Uh, he was a journalism
major at Columbia,

02:05.751 --> 02:08.169
and he also interned at
60 Minutes, before diving back

02:08.211 --> 02:10.338
into academia.
Thank you, Navid.

02:10.380 --> 02:12.633
I see my role here
as challenging

02:12.674 --> 02:13.884
each and every
one of you

02:13.926 --> 02:15.385
to do better, dig deeper,

02:15.427 --> 02:18.806
find the journalistic truth
in all the stories that we tell.

02:18.847 --> 02:20.849
I have a question.

02:20.891 --> 02:21.850
Yes.

02:21.892 --> 02:23.685
Hi. Naomi Clark.
Hi.

02:23.727 --> 02:27.188
So what happens if I--
like you said-- dig deeper,

02:27.230 --> 02:29.441
find the journalistic truth,
blah, blah, blah,

02:29.483 --> 02:32.820
but it all gets
edited out by Navid?

02:32.861 --> 02:34.822
Well...
Oh, tha-that's
because, uh,

02:34.863 --> 02:35.906
you don't cite your sources.

02:35.948 --> 02:37.908
And if I'm protecting
my sources?

02:37.950 --> 02:40.201
A friend of a
friend of a guy

02:40.243 --> 02:42.162
you used to date? No, that's not
a credible source.

02:42.203 --> 02:44.873
Actually, I do have to agree
with Navid on this one.

02:44.915 --> 02:46.374
If we can't verify
the information,

02:46.416 --> 02:47.375
then we shouldn't air it.

02:47.417 --> 02:48.877
We're not a tabloid here.

02:48.919 --> 02:50.838
But we can be.

02:50.879 --> 02:52.547
You ever heard of making
a good first impression?

02:52.589 --> 02:54.591
Ms. Clark, if you'd
like me to review

02:54.633 --> 02:56.217
any segments
you're unhappy with,

02:56.259 --> 02:59.554
I'd be glad to give you my
honest, unbiased critique, but

02:59.596 --> 03:02.432
I'm warning you, I have
very high standards.

03:02.474 --> 03:04.434
Well, they couldn't
be that high,

03:04.476 --> 03:06.061
or you'd be
working in news--

03:06.103 --> 03:07.562
and not bossing a bunch

03:07.604 --> 03:10.024
of wannabe kids around for what,
20 grand a year?

03:10.065 --> 03:13.568
(students murmuring)

03:13.610 --> 03:16.321
If you're done, I'd like to
discuss the next Blaze edition.

03:16.363 --> 03:17.322
But I'm not.

03:17.364 --> 03:18.239
Yes, you are.

03:22.410 --> 03:24.371
NAOMI (scoffs):
Why do we even need

03:24.412 --> 03:27.374
some stupid faculty advisor
watching over our every move?

03:27.415 --> 03:29.960
Oh, my God, it's like
1984 all over again.

03:30.002 --> 03:32.587
I hope not. I look horrible
in shoulder pads and a perm.

03:32.629 --> 03:34.715
NAOMI:
Come on, Sil,
just tell Ade

03:34.756 --> 03:37.467
how bad Cannon
was, please?

03:37.509 --> 03:38.385
Or not.

03:39.511 --> 03:40.888
Hey.
Hey.

03:40.929 --> 03:42.806
So I was wondering if you maybe

03:42.848 --> 03:44.349
want to have lunch today.

03:44.391 --> 03:46.101
Sorry, I'm taking
a history make-up.

03:46.143 --> 03:47.144
Got to run, actually.

03:47.186 --> 03:48.436
Yeah...

03:48.478 --> 03:51.272
Everything good with
the world again?

03:51.314 --> 03:53.525
No. I just asked him
to have lunch with me,

03:53.567 --> 03:55.944
and he claimed he had to
make up a history test.

03:55.986 --> 03:58.488
Obviously, he's still pissed
at me for spying on him.

03:58.530 --> 04:01.241
That, or he actually has
to make up a history test

04:01.282 --> 04:03.202
and I'm just getting
worked up over nothing.

04:03.243 --> 04:04.411
Or both.

04:04.452 --> 04:05.954
No. You know you can't
leave anything

04:05.996 --> 04:07.206
to interpretation with men.

04:07.247 --> 04:09.083
Next time just ask,
"Am I in or out?

04:09.124 --> 04:10.792
"'Cause I'm not popping
the pill every day

04:10.834 --> 04:12.920
just to get rid of zits
and PMS."

04:12.961 --> 04:14.462
Okay, that's
your solution?

04:14.504 --> 04:15.839
We're not even
having sex yet.

04:15.881 --> 04:16.964
Wow.

04:17.007 --> 04:18.341
Well, no wonder
he's blowing you off.

04:18.382 --> 04:20.260
Come on. Right, Ade?

04:20.301 --> 04:21.344
Uh, yeah, whatever.

04:21.386 --> 04:23.638
Um, I got to run
to my locker.

04:23.680 --> 04:24.973
I will catch
you guys later.

04:25.015 --> 04:25.974
Bye.
Yeah.

04:26.016 --> 04:26.975
Okay.
Sure.

04:32.189 --> 04:34.149
ANNIE:
Wait!

04:34.191 --> 04:37.861
Wait, stop!

04:39.029 --> 04:40.781
Oh...

04:40.822 --> 04:42.282
(sighs)

04:45.786 --> 04:47.495
Do you need a ride?

04:47.537 --> 04:49.748
I'm all right, thanks.

04:51.208 --> 04:55.170
Annie, come on,
let me drive you.

04:55.212 --> 04:57.631
All right, thank you.

05:05.597 --> 05:07.975
DIXON: Yeah, sure the
Cavs have LeBron,

05:08.016 --> 05:11.519
but Shaq, he's a bloated
old man!
Look, son, you are
preaching to the choir.

05:11.561 --> 05:13.188
All right, I led
the petition drive

05:13.230 --> 05:15.149
to try to force him
out of Phoenix.

05:15.190 --> 05:16.357
Hi.

05:16.399 --> 05:17.734
Oh, I didn't even
see you there.

05:17.776 --> 05:20.570
So, any dinner requests?

05:20.612 --> 05:23.031
How about my famous
mac and cheese?

05:23.073 --> 05:24.699
Heavy on the cheese,
light on the mac.

05:24.741 --> 05:27.911
Mmm, sounds good but, uh,
actually, we're about

05:27.953 --> 05:29.288
to go out and watch

05:29.329 --> 05:30.705
some March Madness.
Swish!

05:30.747 --> 05:33.208
Look, don't worry, I know
it's a school night.

05:33.250 --> 05:35.169
We won't be out late.

05:35.210 --> 05:38.546
D-Dixon, aren't you
forgetting something?

05:38.588 --> 05:41.549
Oh, um, bye, Mom.

05:41.591 --> 05:43.468
Peace, Dad.
Hey, uh, peace.

05:43.510 --> 05:45.262
Those two seem to be
getting along well.

05:45.304 --> 05:47.139
Yes, they do.

05:54.271 --> 05:57.482
(rock song plays)

06:04.698 --> 06:06.365
(lowers volume)

06:06.407 --> 06:08.869
Look, again, uh, I gotta say,

06:08.910 --> 06:11.246
I was a coward
with the Jen thing.

06:11.288 --> 06:12.873
Yeah, well, it's over.

06:12.914 --> 06:14.415
No, I know, I just...

06:14.457 --> 06:16.501
I feel like I really
should've just came out and...

06:16.543 --> 06:18.212
Can we talk about
something else?

06:18.253 --> 06:20.297
Like, anything in the world?

06:20.339 --> 06:22.299
Yeah, sure.

06:22.341 --> 06:23.967
Like what?

06:24.009 --> 06:27.595
I don't care, you can
pick the subject.

06:27.637 --> 06:31.432
Hmm... ferrets.

06:31.474 --> 06:32.934
(laughing):
Okay.

06:32.976 --> 06:34.102
Um, that's random.

06:34.144 --> 06:36.771
Well, we just passed
the Beverly Hilton,

06:36.813 --> 06:39.607
which reminded me
of Paris Hilton...

06:39.649 --> 06:43.278
who I think was once caught
with an illegal ferret.

06:43.320 --> 06:46.281
I read the tabloids
in my dentist's office.

06:46.323 --> 06:48.158
ANNIE:
Well, fascinating insight

06:48.200 --> 06:51.619
into that mysterious
brain of yours.

06:51.661 --> 06:54.748
Oh, check out those two.

06:54.789 --> 06:57.167
Whoa, someone's reenacting
Pretty Woman.

06:57.209 --> 06:58.710
(Annie laughs)

06:59.836 --> 07:02.714
Liam, are you okay?

07:04.549 --> 07:07.386
That was my stepdad.

07:07.426 --> 07:09.846
And that wasn't my mom with him.

07:11.181 --> 07:14.351
â™ª â™ª

07:38.625 --> 07:40.419
Navid said you wanted to see me?

07:40.460 --> 07:41.420
Yeah.

07:41.461 --> 07:43.838
If we're going to
be working together,

07:43.880 --> 07:45.299
I think you owe me an apology.

07:45.340 --> 07:48.051
(chuckles) No, I think you
owe me an apology.

07:48.093 --> 07:52.597
Naomi, you were
insulting and belligerent.

07:52.639 --> 07:55.100
Not exactly the apology
I'm looking for.

07:55.142 --> 07:56.393
It's kind of like

07:56.435 --> 07:57.727
pulling off a Band-Aid:

07:57.769 --> 07:59.813
If you do it really quickly,
it hardly hurts.

07:59.854 --> 08:03.108
Okay.

08:03.150 --> 08:05.652
I'm sorry, but life's too short.

08:05.693 --> 08:07.612
I'm kicking you
off the Blaze.

08:07.654 --> 08:08.989
What?

08:09.030 --> 08:10.573
You heard me.

08:10.615 --> 08:14.619
Okay, I'm sorry for whatever
it is you think I did wrong.

08:14.661 --> 08:18.706
Ah, let's see, you were
disruptive, rude, irritating...

08:18.748 --> 08:20.334
Fine, fine, I'm sorry
for all of that.

08:20.375 --> 08:21.626
It won't happen again.

08:21.668 --> 08:23.628
You're absolutely right,
it won't.

08:23.670 --> 08:27.090
Please, please,
don't do this.

08:27.132 --> 08:28.883
Okay, I-I finally
found something

08:28.925 --> 08:30.635
that I'm really
passionate about.

08:30.677 --> 08:32.179
And yes, I want
an extracurricular

08:32.220 --> 08:34.306
on my resume for college,
but it's not just that.

08:34.347 --> 08:35.640
I'm good at this.

08:35.682 --> 08:37.267
I'm good on camera,
and I like reporting.

08:37.308 --> 08:39.477
I think it could be something
that I want to pursue.

08:39.519 --> 08:42.981
I mean, Katie Couric's like a
toothy munchkin compared to me.

08:43.023 --> 08:44.483
Please.

08:44.524 --> 08:45.984
Please give me another chance.

08:46.026 --> 08:49.321
I'm sorry,
I've made my decision.

08:49.363 --> 08:50.489
No, what do you want?

08:50.530 --> 08:52.157
Just name it, I'll do anything.

08:52.199 --> 08:53.992
Please, please, please,
I'll do anything.

08:57.996 --> 08:59.998
Are you offering
to sleep with me?

09:00.040 --> 09:01.958
What? No, I...

09:02.000 --> 09:05.003
Because that would be
completely inappropriate.

09:06.380 --> 09:08.340
Like I said,
you're off the Blaze.

09:08.382 --> 09:10.300
Door's that way.

09:12.511 --> 09:13.845
NAVID:
At the risk of having

09:13.887 --> 09:16.848
our first argument, you are
completely wrong, okay?

09:16.890 --> 09:19.559
Marshall McLuhan like, invented
the term "channel surfing."

09:19.600 --> 09:20.685
He would've definitely
considered

09:20.727 --> 09:22.270
the internet
a cool medium.

09:22.312 --> 09:24.356
It's active, not sedentary.

09:24.398 --> 09:26.691
Okay, what if you use the
internet to watch a movie?

09:26.733 --> 09:29.569
McLuhan considered movies
to be a hot medium.

09:29.610 --> 09:31.321
You know what I think
is really hot?

09:31.363 --> 09:32.489
What?

09:32.531 --> 09:35.075
That you even know who
Marshall McLuhan is.

09:35.116 --> 09:36.368
Are you kidding me?

09:36.410 --> 09:37.827
Understand Media:
The Extensions of Man

09:37.869 --> 09:40.038
was like my Goodnight, Moon.

09:40.080 --> 09:42.123
That's hot.

09:46.503 --> 09:48.255
Uh, I'll s-see you later.

09:48.296 --> 09:49.297
Yeah.

09:55.220 --> 09:56.888
(clears throat)

09:56.930 --> 09:58.223
You need a hand?

09:58.265 --> 09:59.891
Nope, I have it.

09:59.933 --> 10:03.562
Look, I, uh, I know
it's kind of weird,

10:03.603 --> 10:06.523
you know, your bandmate
dating your ex and...

10:06.565 --> 10:08.024
No, no, no, it's fine.

10:08.066 --> 10:10.068
I mean, I knew he
was gonna move on.

10:10.110 --> 10:12.070
Not with the bass player--
I didn't see that coming.

10:12.112 --> 10:14.364
But it's rock and roll,
so, it's fine.

10:14.406 --> 10:17.284
So, we're cool?

10:17.325 --> 10:19.160
Yeah, yeah, totally.

10:23.164 --> 10:25.333
(applause and cheering)

10:28.962 --> 10:32.549
Yeah, I hope you're putting some
money on Villanova tomorrow.

10:32.591 --> 10:34.217
Villanova, really?

10:34.259 --> 10:36.344
Yeah, you know, I've
been on a roll lately.

10:36.386 --> 10:38.972
Hmm. Well, all right,
Villanova it is.

10:39.013 --> 10:41.975
After all, you are
my good luck charm.

10:42.016 --> 10:43.726
And if I win,
we can split it.

10:43.768 --> 10:45.437
Hey, hey, when we win...

10:45.479 --> 10:48.022
I'll take you to that Lakers
game on Sunday to celebrate.

10:48.064 --> 10:50.484
Oh, man, I'd love to.

10:50.525 --> 10:52.777
But unfortunately,
I won't be here Sunday.

10:52.819 --> 10:54.112
I have to head home.

10:54.154 --> 10:55.530
Already?

10:55.572 --> 10:57.157
Yeah, I gotta
get back to work.

10:57.198 --> 10:59.284
You know, I have
responsibilities.

10:59.326 --> 11:02.036
When you called, I dropped
everything and came running.

11:02.078 --> 11:04.414
Yeah, yeah, that's cool.

11:04.456 --> 11:07.125
Look, I tell you what,
tomorrow, after school,

11:07.167 --> 11:08.668
we can come here for
one final celebration.

11:08.709 --> 11:10.962
We can watch the game and wait
for our ship to come in.

11:11.004 --> 11:14.132
Yeah, yeah, that
s... that sounds good.

11:14.174 --> 11:16.217
(applause and cheering)

11:20.013 --> 11:22.432
â™ª â™ª

11:28.522 --> 11:30.440
All right, I want you
to watch the tape,

11:30.482 --> 11:32.859
and you'll see the flaw
in your mechanics, all right?

11:32.900 --> 11:33.985
TEDDY:
You look at the flaws.

11:34.027 --> 11:36.404
I want to relive that
135-mile-an-hour serve.

11:36.446 --> 11:37.696
(laughing)

11:37.738 --> 11:39.782
All right, see you
tomorrow, man.
See you later.

11:39.824 --> 11:42.619
What's going on with us?

11:42.661 --> 11:44.287
So much for small talk.

11:44.329 --> 11:46.331
Look, I know why you're
acting all weird, okay?

11:46.373 --> 11:47.499
I...

11:47.541 --> 11:49.417
I was a jealous,
paranoid freak.

11:50.669 --> 11:52.629
But what I don't know is

11:52.671 --> 11:54.548
if my jealous,
paranoid freakiness

11:54.589 --> 11:57.133
is something that
you can get over

11:57.175 --> 11:59.177
or it's something
that you can't.

11:59.219 --> 12:02.847
I don't know, either.

12:02.889 --> 12:05.016
I want to be with someone
who trusts me, Silver.

12:05.058 --> 12:05.933
I do. I...

12:06.976 --> 12:08.520
Now.

12:08.562 --> 12:10.271
Until I get a call from a girl,

12:10.313 --> 12:11.481
or run into
someone from my past.

12:11.523 --> 12:12.815
Come on, that is not true.

12:12.857 --> 12:13.858
Okay? I...

12:13.900 --> 12:15.610
Look, I made a mistake.

12:15.652 --> 12:18.321
And I'm really sorry.

12:18.363 --> 12:20.699
But the unfortunate
thing here is that

12:20.739 --> 12:22.200
I can't exactly prove to you

12:22.242 --> 12:24.160
that I'm not gonna do
it again unless you...

12:24.202 --> 12:26.371
unless you give me
another chance.

12:27.830 --> 12:29.416
So, how about it?

12:31.668 --> 12:32.835
Okay.

12:32.877 --> 12:35.296
(whispers):
Okay.

12:51.271 --> 12:52.731
LIAM:
Hey.
Yeah?

12:52.813 --> 12:54.982
(groans)
(car alarm chirps)

12:55.024 --> 12:57.569
What the hell is...
wrong with you?

12:57.611 --> 12:59.028
Nothing, nothing kicking
your ass won't fix.

12:59.070 --> 13:00.321
Kicking my ass, huh?

13:00.363 --> 13:01.906
Hey, hey, hey! Stop, stop! Stop!

13:01.948 --> 13:04.325
Come on!
Stop it!

13:04.367 --> 13:05.493
What is going on?

13:05.535 --> 13:07.161
Are you okay, Jeffrey?
I'm fine.

13:07.203 --> 13:08.538
He was hiding in the bushes.

13:08.580 --> 13:10.164
He came out and took
a sucker punch...

13:10.206 --> 13:11.916
Because I saw you coming out
of the Beverly Wilshire today,

13:11.958 --> 13:13.084
making out with some bimbo.

13:13.126 --> 13:14.586
What?!

13:19.840 --> 13:22.427
Oh, my-- you are a bastard.

13:22.469 --> 13:24.596
I can explain!

13:24.638 --> 13:26.889
I don't want to hear
anything you have to say!

13:26.931 --> 13:31.018
Sweetheart, I can explain.

13:32.312 --> 13:34.855
Colleen!

13:39.736 --> 13:42.821
â™ª â™ª

13:42.863 --> 13:46.367
â™ª He is all about she â™ª

13:46.409 --> 13:50.622
â™ª She is all about her â™ª

13:50.664 --> 13:53.207
â™ª He doesn't happen to see â™ª

13:53.249 --> 13:55.042
â™ª That she doesn't know she â™ª

13:55.084 --> 13:57.545
â™ª Really rather would be â™ª

13:57.587 --> 14:00.381
â™ª With someone like her... â™ª

14:00.423 --> 14:01.675
Hi.

14:01.716 --> 14:03.217
You've been avoiding me.

14:03.259 --> 14:06.887
No, I've just been really busy
with the band and stuff.

14:06.929 --> 14:08.389
I don't blame you.

14:08.431 --> 14:10.517
I put you in a really
bad position.

14:10.558 --> 14:13.394
But your friendship means
more to me than anything.

14:13.436 --> 14:15.188
And I really don't
want to lose that.

14:15.229 --> 14:17.440
Me, neither.

14:17.482 --> 14:19.359
Okay, so can we
just pretend like

14:19.400 --> 14:21.569
I never told you
about my stupid crush

14:21.611 --> 14:24.905
and I don't know, just go
back to the way things were?

14:24.947 --> 14:26.199
What crush?

14:26.240 --> 14:28.075
Great, 'cause I have
lots to tell you.

14:28.117 --> 14:29.494
Me, too.

14:29.536 --> 14:31.037
Did you hear
about Pete Duffy?

14:31.078 --> 14:32.497
What?
Yeah, he singed
his eyebrows off.

14:32.539 --> 14:34.332
NAOMI:
So, once it gets out

14:34.374 --> 14:36.959
that I have been dealt
a grave injustice by Cannon,

14:37.001 --> 14:41.047
I'm sure the student body will
demand I get my job back.

14:41.088 --> 14:43.049
Yeah, I wouldn't hold
your breath on that one.

14:43.090 --> 14:46.219
Oh, come on, you
witnessed my humiliation.

14:46.260 --> 14:48.346
We agree that he was
out of line, right?

14:48.388 --> 14:49.347
Eh.
No, "eh"!

14:49.389 --> 14:50.682
He was totally out of line.

14:50.724 --> 14:52.225
He didn't pick on
anyone but me.

14:52.266 --> 14:54.101
I mean, they always go for
the weakest of the herd.

14:54.143 --> 14:55.228
Weakest of the herd?

14:55.269 --> 14:56.771
I've heard you called
many a thing,

14:56.813 --> 14:58.481
but that would be a first.

14:58.523 --> 14:59.940
Look, I know this isn't
what you want to hear,

14:59.982 --> 15:01.818
but you were the one
out of line.

15:01.860 --> 15:03.277
(scoffs)

15:03.319 --> 15:06.113
I cannot believe you're
taking his side, Silver!

15:06.155 --> 15:08.867
Ugh! Gia?

15:08.908 --> 15:12.620
Will you kindly remind Silver
what a jerk Mr. Cannon was

15:12.662 --> 15:15.122
this morning at
the Blaze meeting?

15:15.164 --> 15:16.916
I don't think
he was the jerk.

15:16.957 --> 15:18.418
What is wrong with you people?

15:18.459 --> 15:20.211
It's like we were at two
totally different meetings.

15:20.253 --> 15:22.756
Yeah, I was at the one where
you wouldn't shut up.

15:22.797 --> 15:25.633
I don't think you're gonna get
a lot of support on this one.

15:25.675 --> 15:27.051
Well, you know what, I should!

15:27.093 --> 15:29.136
Because that guy

15:29.178 --> 15:30.764
is a total douchebag!

15:30.805 --> 15:32.098
Total douchebag!

15:32.139 --> 15:33.558
Okay, do you think

15:33.600 --> 15:35.727
you're blowing this out
of proportion a little bit?

15:35.769 --> 15:36.895
No, I'm not!

15:36.936 --> 15:38.229
Do you know what

15:38.271 --> 15:40.774
he said to me-- Mr. Cannon?

15:40.815 --> 15:45.612
He said if I wanted back on the
Blaze, I had to sleep with him!

15:45.653 --> 15:47.238
What?!

15:50.116 --> 15:51.576
Okay, that's sexual harassment.

15:51.618 --> 15:52.993
Yeah, no kidding.

15:53.035 --> 15:56.497
So, can I finally get your
support against this guy?

15:57.624 --> 15:58.999
Sure.

15:59.041 --> 16:00.126
Oh, my God.

16:00.167 --> 16:01.335
(sighs)

16:14.849 --> 16:17.143
Uh, so, I got my tools.

16:17.184 --> 16:19.186
Uh, I'll leave the boat for now

16:19.228 --> 16:21.105
and maybe I can
come back for it later.

16:21.147 --> 16:23.065
I hope so, you know,
but-but if not, I can deal.

16:23.107 --> 16:25.568
Liam, I just had a long
talk with Jeffrey.

16:25.610 --> 16:28.404
Hey, don't worry.

16:28.446 --> 16:29.530
We've survived

16:29.572 --> 16:31.073
a lot worse than this.

16:31.115 --> 16:32.575
We'll be okay on our own.

16:32.617 --> 16:34.744
I'll get an after-school job,
if you need me to kick in.

16:34.786 --> 16:37.204
You don't have to do that.
I would do anything for you.

16:37.246 --> 16:39.039
I know, and I appreciate that.

16:39.081 --> 16:42.042
Look...

16:42.084 --> 16:46.046
Jeffrey and I have our
issues, I won't deny that.

16:46.088 --> 16:49.175
But you don't just walk out
when things are going bad,

16:49.216 --> 16:50.426
you work through it.

16:52.052 --> 16:54.180
I know it's not what
you were expecting,

16:54.221 --> 16:58.225
but please understand.

16:58.267 --> 17:01.270
Liam, say something.

17:01.312 --> 17:04.315
I've got nothing to say to you.

17:09.487 --> 17:11.446
ELLIE (over TV):
Take me with your, Peter.

17:11.489 --> 17:12.866
Take me to your island.

17:12.906 --> 17:15.159
I want to do all those things
you talked about.

17:15.201 --> 17:16.536
Oh...

17:16.577 --> 17:18.454
You'd better go back
to your bed.

17:19.622 --> 17:21.915
It's so romantic.

17:21.958 --> 17:24.042
Oh, yeah.
They're totally...

17:24.084 --> 17:25.920
...meant for...
Meant for each
other, I know.

17:25.962 --> 17:27.630
(giggling)

17:27.672 --> 17:30.591
Oh, my God, I
love this scene.

17:30.633 --> 17:33.427
Sorry.
No, please, after you.

17:33.469 --> 17:35.555
No, go for it.

17:35.596 --> 17:38.307
We can run away, everything
will take care of itself.

17:38.349 --> 17:45.481
Please, Peter, I can't let you
out of my life now.

17:45.523 --> 17:47.233
I couldn't live without you.

17:47.274 --> 17:49.109
(crying)

17:49.151 --> 17:51.487
â™ª â™ª
(Silver chuckling)

17:51.529 --> 17:53.781
Okay, no, I'm not saying
I'm not athletic.

17:53.823 --> 17:55.449
I'm just, you know,
I never really sparked

17:55.491 --> 17:57.744
to traditional
sports, per se.

17:57.785 --> 17:59.286
Except for dodgeball.

17:59.328 --> 18:02.040
I was always pretty
good at dodgeball.

18:02.081 --> 18:03.583
Is that so?
Oh, yeah.

18:03.624 --> 18:05.376
Whatever I lacked in
hand-eye coordination,

18:05.418 --> 18:07.879
I made up for in rage.

18:07.921 --> 18:10.130
(laughing)

18:10.172 --> 18:13.801
Um, are-are you in the mood
for some dessert?

18:13.843 --> 18:16.429
Oh, I wish I could-- I gotta
get back to the Blaze.

18:16.470 --> 18:18.138
They have this really
interesting...
Teddy?!

18:19.306 --> 18:21.141
Tara.
Hey!

18:21.183 --> 18:22.476
Wow!

18:22.518 --> 18:24.103
Long time.

18:24.144 --> 18:25.312
Yeah.

18:25.354 --> 18:26.480
Tara, this is Silver.

18:26.522 --> 18:27.648
Hey, it's nice to meet you.

18:27.690 --> 18:29.275
You, too.

18:29.316 --> 18:30.777
Tara and I used to date.

18:30.818 --> 18:33.487
Did you? Oh, that's cool.

18:33.529 --> 18:34.989
TARA: Hey, you know
what? I have

18:35.031 --> 18:36.616
passes to a screening for the
new Tarantino film tonight.

18:36.657 --> 18:38.659
You guys want to come?

18:38.701 --> 18:40.828
Well, Silver has to get
back to school-- now, actually.

18:40.870 --> 18:41.955
Hmm...

18:41.996 --> 18:43.330
But, uh, I'm free.

18:43.372 --> 18:44.999
TARA:
Great.

18:45.041 --> 18:46.667
Unless, of course, that's
not cool with you, Silver.

18:46.709 --> 18:48.127
Me?

18:48.168 --> 18:50.379
No, of course, it's
totally cool, yeah.

18:50.421 --> 18:53.507
Great! Oh, don't worry,
I'll take care of the check.

18:53.549 --> 18:56.010
Oh, well, thank you.

18:56.052 --> 18:58.137
All right, it was
nice to meet you.

18:58.178 --> 18:59.305
You, too.

18:59.346 --> 19:01.432
You guys have fun.

19:02.725 --> 19:04.351
TEDDY:
So, how have you been?

19:04.393 --> 19:06.520
Good, it's so funny
bumping into you today.

19:06.562 --> 19:07.772
I know, tonight
sounds great.

19:10.357 --> 19:12.234
NAOMI:
Emergency meeting at the Blaze
tomorrow afternoon.

19:12.276 --> 19:15.780
Be there, big announcement!

19:15.822 --> 19:18.240
â™ª â™ª
(dialing phone)

19:18.282 --> 19:19.909
Hi, it's Naomi.

19:19.951 --> 19:23.913
So, emergency meeting tomorrow
afternoon.

19:23.955 --> 19:26.332
Um, I will call you back.

19:26.373 --> 19:27.416
Hey.

19:27.458 --> 19:29.961
What's wrong?

19:36.134 --> 19:37.259
What's going on?

19:37.301 --> 19:40.096
I caught my stepdad
cheating on my mom.

19:40.138 --> 19:42.389
Liam, I'm sorry.

19:42.431 --> 19:46.602
You know what really sucks?

19:46.644 --> 19:48.104
She's staying with him.

19:48.146 --> 19:51.024
I know exactly
what you're feeling.

19:51.065 --> 19:56.487
My mom put up with that same
crap from my dad for... ever.

19:56.529 --> 19:59.323
I still don't get why.

20:01.575 --> 20:03.703
(sighs)

20:03.744 --> 20:05.997
Do you mind if I
crash here tonight?

20:06.039 --> 20:07.999
Not at all.

20:08.041 --> 20:09.876
Tonight, tomorrow,
as long as you want.

20:17.383 --> 20:20.011
â™ª â™ª

20:26.934 --> 20:28.186
Hey.
Hey.

20:28.227 --> 20:30.146
I've been thinking about you.

20:30.188 --> 20:32.690
How's the whole
stepdad situation?

20:32.732 --> 20:34.025
Not great.

20:34.067 --> 20:35.234
Oh...

20:35.275 --> 20:37.028
Annie, I really need
to talk to you.

20:37.070 --> 20:38.071
Not now.

20:38.112 --> 20:39.780
Please, it's important.

20:39.822 --> 20:41.199
It's fine.

20:41.240 --> 20:43.283
I'll see you later.

20:44.744 --> 20:46.037
Can you just give me
five minutes, please?

20:46.079 --> 20:47.371
I'm gonna be late for class.

20:47.413 --> 20:48.706
Okay, three minutes,
uh, one minute?

20:48.748 --> 20:50.041
Come on, Annie,

20:50.083 --> 20:51.542
what's 60 seconds out
of your damn life?

20:51.584 --> 20:53.419
Don't touch me.

20:53.460 --> 20:54.712
Come on, Annie,
please, I'm sorry.

20:54.754 --> 20:56.172
I just... come talk to me.

20:56.214 --> 20:59.008
I love you.

20:59.050 --> 21:00.968
(schoolbell rings)
Damn it.

21:01.010 --> 21:02.136
(thud)

21:09.018 --> 21:10.895
(clock ticking)

21:13.313 --> 21:16.192
(keypad beeps)

21:16.234 --> 21:18.694
(recording):
Yo, it's Dixon. Leave a message.

21:18.736 --> 21:22.031
Hi, hey, it's-it's me. I was
just wondering where you are.

21:22.073 --> 21:23.991
I thought we were meeting
at the house.

21:24.033 --> 21:26.869
Um, maybe I got it wrong.

21:26.911 --> 21:29.038
You know, I'll just meet you
at the restaurant.

21:31.624 --> 21:33.084
SILVER:
Oh, yeah.

21:33.126 --> 21:34.376
And after all that he goes,

21:34.418 --> 21:37.088
"You don't mind if I
go with Tara, right?"

21:37.130 --> 21:39.381
Ugh! It's-It's obvious
what he's doing.

21:39.423 --> 21:40.633
Boning that Tara chick?

21:41.842 --> 21:43.219
Wrong answer.

21:43.261 --> 21:44.262
Testing me.

21:44.303 --> 21:46.597
I'm not buying it.
(knock at door)

21:46.639 --> 21:48.266
Knock, knock!
Hey.

21:48.307 --> 21:50.977
Hey, I wanted to bring you both
a flyer for our band's gig.

21:51.018 --> 21:52.478
I hope you can make it.

21:52.519 --> 21:53.604
Oh!

21:53.646 --> 21:55.273
Wouldn't miss it
for the world!

21:55.355 --> 21:56.983
"The Glorious Steinems"?
Mm-hmm.

21:57.024 --> 21:58.442
"Live at the Beach Club."

21:58.484 --> 22:00.903
What-What is a Steinem? That
disease you get in your eye?

22:00.945 --> 22:03.072
Beats me. They had the
name when I joined.

22:03.114 --> 22:04.490
Are you guys kidding?

22:05.491 --> 22:07.034
Glorious Steinems?

22:07.076 --> 22:08.619
Gloria Steinem?

22:08.661 --> 22:12.290
Oh, come on, she's only one
of the most important feminists.

22:12.331 --> 22:13.958
Editor and publisher
of Ms. magazine.

22:14.000 --> 22:16.627
Oh, you know what a Steinem
is-- it's a beer mug.

22:16.669 --> 22:19.672
ADRIANNA:
Yes, that is totally it.

22:19.713 --> 22:22.424
Um, can I talk to you
guys about something?

22:22.466 --> 22:23.592
Something complicated?

22:23.634 --> 22:27.554
Talk. Complicated's
my second language.

22:32.392 --> 22:36.480
So, Gia told me
she has a crush on me.

22:38.816 --> 22:40.526
How did you handle it?

22:40.567 --> 22:43.821
At first, I totally freaked out
and completely avoided her.

22:43.863 --> 22:45.489
And then,

22:45.531 --> 22:46.907
I got over it.

22:48.201 --> 22:50.452
And now, I... I don't know.

22:50.494 --> 22:54.372
I mean, we have this
really great connection.

22:54.414 --> 22:55.666
And last night,

22:55.708 --> 22:58.460
I started thinking
about it, about her.

22:58.502 --> 23:00.213
Not as a friend, you know?

23:01.339 --> 23:02.380
Really?

23:02.422 --> 23:04.175
Yeah.

23:04.217 --> 23:07.385
We were watching this
romantic scene in a movie and...

23:07.427 --> 23:09.096
I kind of just stopped
watching the movie

23:09.138 --> 23:10.556
and started thinking about Gia.

23:10.597 --> 23:12.725
And I don't know why.

23:12.766 --> 23:15.728
I mean, maybe I'm just
trying to rebound from Navid.

23:15.769 --> 23:17.855
But...

23:17.897 --> 23:19.315
Like, I know I need to move on.

23:19.357 --> 23:21.567
I just didn't think I'd
be moving on with a girl.

23:21.608 --> 23:23.736
Until now.
Crafty!

23:23.777 --> 23:25.196
A little lady-lady action
might be just the thing

23:25.238 --> 23:26.655
to get the Persian stallion back

23:26.697 --> 23:28.991
in your stable.

23:29.033 --> 23:30.492
Seriously, guys,
what do you think?

23:30.534 --> 23:32.370
If I'm having these
feelings for a girl,

23:32.410 --> 23:33.620
does that mean I'm gay?

23:36.582 --> 23:37.541
Well, it's a little gay.

23:38.542 --> 23:40.169
What? It is.

23:40.211 --> 23:43.714
I don't know, I...
I don't think sexuality

23:43.756 --> 23:45.883
is black and white.

23:45.925 --> 23:47.551
It's more of,
um, like a spectrum.

23:47.593 --> 23:49.511
Yeah, there are some people
who are 100% gay,

23:49.553 --> 23:50.846
or 100% straight...

23:50.888 --> 23:52.848
Well, that's true. I mean,
gay guys, straight guys,

23:52.890 --> 23:54.267
they all want to
sleep with me.

23:54.308 --> 23:57.103
But honestly,
I think most of us

23:57.144 --> 23:58.812
fall somewhere
in the middle.

23:58.854 --> 24:00.898
It just depends
on where we are

24:00.940 --> 24:03.192
and who we're open to
falling in love with.

24:03.234 --> 24:05.236
At least, that's what
Kinsey found.

24:05.278 --> 24:06.904
I'd actually make
a really good gay icon.

24:06.946 --> 24:08.406
I mean, think about it.

24:08.446 --> 24:10.032
Cher, Liza...
You know, the
important thing,

24:10.074 --> 24:12.868
just don't get caught up
in the labels.

24:12.910 --> 24:15.537
How does Gia make you feel?

24:15.579 --> 24:17.081
Really happy.

24:17.123 --> 24:18.874
Like more than
"friendship happy"?

24:18.916 --> 24:21.294
Um, yeah, I think so.

24:29.260 --> 24:31.137
â™ª â™ª
(keypad beeps)

24:40.771 --> 24:43.774
(giggling)
Drinking chai, huh?

24:43.816 --> 24:46.026
That's very interesting.

24:46.068 --> 24:48.404
I'm sure you hear what
they say about chai drinkers.

24:48.446 --> 24:50.239
No, what do they say?

24:50.281 --> 24:53.117
They say that they're very
possessive about their papadum.

24:53.159 --> 24:55.619
(laughing)

24:55.661 --> 24:56.954
(chuckles)

24:56.996 --> 24:59.999
Okay, so, tell me,
how are things going

25:00.040 --> 25:01.583
with Dixon's birth mom?

25:01.625 --> 25:03.169
Hmm...

25:03.210 --> 25:04.586
That good, huh?

25:04.628 --> 25:06.172
Oh, I feel like
a horrible person.

25:06.213 --> 25:08.424
You're not horrible.

25:08.466 --> 25:09.758
You're human.

25:09.800 --> 25:11.093
I mean, how can you not

25:11.135 --> 25:12.552
feel conflicted
with her being here?

25:23.063 --> 25:25.274
Thank you.

25:25.316 --> 25:26.859
For everything.

25:26.900 --> 25:28.610
For listening to me vent,

25:28.652 --> 25:30.612
for understanding
where I'm coming from.

25:30.654 --> 25:31.613
Of course.

25:31.655 --> 25:33.240
Yeah, well, you
say "of course,"

25:33.282 --> 25:35.451
but believe me, that's not
what I'm getting at home.

25:35.493 --> 25:37.370
You should be.

25:37.411 --> 25:39.246
You deserve it.

25:53.177 --> 25:54.552
What are you doing?

25:54.594 --> 25:56.389
I misread your signal.
I'm-I'm sorry.

25:56.430 --> 25:58.974
Yeah, that-that-that-that-that
should not have happened.

25:59.016 --> 25:59.975
I'm, I'm, I'm...

26:00.017 --> 26:02.353
Kai, I'm married.

26:02.395 --> 26:03.270
I've gotta go.

26:07.066 --> 26:08.275
(beeps)

26:08.317 --> 26:10.403
(phone line ringing)

26:10.444 --> 26:12.321
TEDDY: Hey.
SILVER:
Hey.

26:12.363 --> 26:14.740
Uh, I didn't see you today.

26:14.781 --> 26:16.574
I was just wondering...
is-is everything okay?

26:16.616 --> 26:18.327
Oh, yeah, just laying low.

26:18.369 --> 26:19.786
Wicked hangover.

26:19.828 --> 26:21.663
From a Tarantino movie?

26:21.705 --> 26:23.999
Oh, yeah, Tara and I
blew that off.

26:24.041 --> 26:26.377
I woke up on a chaise,
covered in sand,

26:26.419 --> 26:29.338
with a headache like it was the
morning after St. Paddy's Day.

26:29.380 --> 26:33.467
Wow, that... that sounds
like a lot of fun.

26:33.509 --> 26:34.634
Yeah, it was.

26:34.676 --> 26:36.845
Anyway, gotta get back
on the court.

26:36.887 --> 26:39.390
Bye.

26:41.475 --> 26:42.684
(sighs)

26:42.726 --> 26:45.645
(loud electronic gunfire,
characters shouting)

26:45.687 --> 26:46.897
(knocking)

26:49.733 --> 26:51.609
It's open.

26:53.571 --> 26:54.821
What happened today?

26:54.863 --> 26:56.740
I thought we had plans.

26:56.782 --> 27:00.660
Oh, uh, yeah,
guess I forgot.

27:00.702 --> 27:01.912
My bad.

27:04.331 --> 27:07.126
Dixon, are you upset
because I'm leaving?

27:09.295 --> 27:11.380
You'd think I'd be
used to that by now.

27:11.422 --> 27:13.090
You know it's not for good.

27:13.132 --> 27:14.716
Whatever.

27:14.758 --> 27:16.510
No, Dixon.

27:16.552 --> 27:18.095
(sighs)

27:18.137 --> 27:22.600
Listen, this last week,
reconnecting with you,

27:22.640 --> 27:24.810
it has been amazing.

27:27.146 --> 27:31.317
Look, I... I want to be
a part of your life.

27:35.154 --> 27:37.739
Why should I believe you?

27:37.781 --> 27:40.451
If you wanted me to be
a part of your life so bad,

27:40.493 --> 27:42.244
why have you never
reached out to me?

27:42.286 --> 27:44.704
Not once, not ever!

27:44.746 --> 27:47.166
Even now, I had to contact you.

27:47.207 --> 27:49.126
You're my mother!

27:49.168 --> 27:50.628
It's not supposed
to be like that.

27:53.297 --> 27:55.424
Look, I didn't contact you

27:55.466 --> 27:57.510
because I didn't want to
disrupt your life.

27:59.303 --> 28:01.388
But that didn't stop me

28:01.430 --> 28:03.307
from thinking about you
every single day.

28:04.891 --> 28:07.269
Look, Dixon,

28:07.311 --> 28:10.105
you were always
in my prayers.

28:10.147 --> 28:12.149
Always.

28:13.859 --> 28:15.653
You gotta believe me.

28:17.821 --> 28:21.283
And all this time, I...
thought you'd moved on.

28:21.325 --> 28:25.787
Never.

28:25.829 --> 28:28.624
You're my baby.

28:28.666 --> 28:31.627
I want to be a... a
part of your life.

28:31.669 --> 28:33.086
All right? And I promise

28:33.128 --> 28:36.549
as much as you want me
around, I'll be around.

28:55.859 --> 28:57.486
NAOMI:
There comes a time

28:57.528 --> 29:00.322
when we are called
to a higher power.

29:00.364 --> 29:03.075
When the little people wake up

29:03.116 --> 29:07.538
and realize, together,
we're a big person.

29:07.580 --> 29:08.872
Together, we can fight

29:08.914 --> 29:11.917
the tyranny that would
control us.

29:11.958 --> 29:16.171
We must speak up now,
or forever hold our peace.

29:16.213 --> 29:18.048
She's kind of a smorgasbord
of metaphors there,

29:18.090 --> 29:19.383
isn't she?
Yeah.

29:19.425 --> 29:23.220
But suffice it to say, I
have been mistreated by Cannon.

29:23.262 --> 29:26.848
So, we, the people, must protest

29:26.890 --> 29:30.894
and demand I be reinstated
and that Cannon be sent back

29:30.936 --> 29:33.522
to that godforsaken nerd-nest.

29:33.564 --> 29:37.276
Uh... wh-what's going on?

29:37.317 --> 29:39.737
Cannon kicked me off the Blaze,

29:39.778 --> 29:43.949
so we are striking until
I'm allowed back on.

29:43.990 --> 29:46.034
We've got to get an
edition out by Friday.

29:46.076 --> 29:48.537
Tough tatas, honey.

29:48.579 --> 29:50.372
Union! Union! Union!

29:50.414 --> 29:52.541
Okay, whoa, whoa,
no, no, no, stop.

29:52.583 --> 29:54.209
Look, all right, whoa,

29:54.251 --> 29:55.628
look, everyone, okay?

29:55.669 --> 29:58.004
Uh, let me just go talk
to Mr. Cannon and see if,

29:58.046 --> 30:00.132
see if I can get him to
give you another chance.

30:00.173 --> 30:02.468
Okay, okay?
Okay.

30:02.509 --> 30:04.720
Okay?
Fine.

30:04.762 --> 30:07.473
I will see you at
1300 hours tomorrow.

30:09.015 --> 30:11.644
I believe that's
lunch period.

30:13.979 --> 30:15.522
(stick clattering)

30:20.360 --> 30:22.404
Hey, Dana.

30:22.446 --> 30:23.405
(whispers):
Hi.

30:23.447 --> 30:25.574
So, Dixon tells me
you're leaving us.

30:25.616 --> 30:28.076
Yeah, I gotta get back to work.

30:28.118 --> 30:30.579
Well, it's been nice having you.

30:30.621 --> 30:32.164
Thanks.

30:32.205 --> 30:34.082
Um, Debbie?

30:34.124 --> 30:39.797
This is awkward, but, um, I
need to tell you something.

30:39.838 --> 30:42.549
Uh, yesterday, I-I went to
the restaurant to meet Dixon.

30:42.591 --> 30:46.637
And I saw you at a cafe
with a handsome man.

30:46.679 --> 30:49.264
Um, yesterday?

30:49.306 --> 30:52.518
Right, you know, that was
my yoga teacher, Kai.

30:52.559 --> 30:56.271
That's a rather close
student/teacher relationship

30:56.313 --> 30:58.315
you have there.
Look, Dana, it's
not what you think.

30:58.357 --> 31:02.110
I-I... that kiss was a mistake,
and... on his part.

31:02.152 --> 31:05.030
I was completely
shocked and taken aback,

31:05.071 --> 31:07.199
and I told him so in
no uncertain terms.

31:07.240 --> 31:08.450
I-I'm going to tell
Harry everything

31:08.492 --> 31:09.618
the minute he gets home.

31:09.660 --> 31:12.454
Are you sure that's a good idea?

31:12.496 --> 31:16.500
Wh-What do you mean?

31:16.542 --> 31:18.460
I mean, I've been
around you two.

31:18.502 --> 31:20.128
There's a little tension.

31:20.170 --> 31:21.588
Look, and jealousy, it's...

31:21.630 --> 31:23.173
it's the number one killer
of relationships.

31:23.215 --> 31:25.634
Believe me, I used to temp
for a divorce lawyer.

31:25.676 --> 31:30.138
But Dana, I think that this
is probably a family matter.

31:30.180 --> 31:33.099
Yeah, yeah.

31:33.141 --> 31:35.853
It's just... family matters
always trickle down

31:35.894 --> 31:37.479
to the kids,
you know, and...

31:37.521 --> 31:40.440
one of your kids
I gave birth to.

31:40.482 --> 31:46.071
Anyways, that's just
my two cents.

31:46.112 --> 31:48.156
You have a great family.

31:48.198 --> 31:50.534
Don't risk it.

31:57.207 --> 31:58.083
(knocking on door)

31:59.668 --> 32:02.379
Hey, picked up a couple more
DVDs on the way over.

32:02.421 --> 32:04.882
But, uh, Sexual Behavior
in the Human Female

32:04.923 --> 32:07.676
seems a lot more interesting.

32:07.718 --> 32:09.010
I'm confused.

32:09.052 --> 32:11.680
Okay.

32:11.722 --> 32:14.974
I mean, if sexuality
is on a spectrum,

32:15.016 --> 32:17.603
does that mean that most people
choose to be straight

32:17.644 --> 32:20.188
because it's what they know
and what they're used to?

32:20.230 --> 32:21.690
Maybe some people do.

32:21.732 --> 32:22.858
What does that mean?

32:22.900 --> 32:24.610
That being gay is a choice?

32:24.651 --> 32:25.736
Because I definitely

32:25.778 --> 32:27.279
don't believe that's true.

32:27.320 --> 32:29.448
I don't think it's a choice
for a lot of people.

32:29.489 --> 32:33.076
As far back as I can remember,
I've liked girls.

32:33.118 --> 32:35.704
But that doesn't mean
that everyone's like that.

32:35.746 --> 32:37.706
Some people

32:37.748 --> 32:39.917
might fall somewhere
in the middle.

32:39.958 --> 32:40.959
That makes sense.

32:42.294 --> 32:44.546
Then again, everything
I'm reading makes sense

32:44.588 --> 32:46.131
until it doesn't
make sense, so...

32:47.507 --> 32:50.803
(sighing)

32:55.599 --> 32:57.476
Why are you reading those?

32:57.517 --> 32:59.561
'Cause...

32:59.603 --> 33:01.104
(chuckling)

33:01.146 --> 33:04.232
Because...

33:04.274 --> 33:05.859
I think I like you.

33:08.904 --> 33:10.989
Look...

33:11.030 --> 33:12.449
whatever you're
struggling with,

33:12.491 --> 33:15.160
I don't think
you're gonna find the answer

33:15.201 --> 33:16.244
in one of these books.

33:16.286 --> 33:17.913
Yeah, no kidding.

33:17.955 --> 33:21.124
So, how do I figure it out?

33:23.669 --> 33:25.629
Well, um...

33:29.257 --> 33:32.678
We could kiss, and,
I don't know...

33:33.887 --> 33:36.055
See how you feel.

33:38.642 --> 33:41.770
Um, yeah. That sounds
like a good idea.

33:41.812 --> 33:43.229
Okay.

33:47.860 --> 33:48.944
Okay.

34:06.378 --> 34:09.339
Good or gross?

34:09.380 --> 34:11.717
Good.

34:11.757 --> 34:13.301
You're a good kisser.

34:13.342 --> 34:14.928
I don't get a lot
of complaints.

34:14.969 --> 34:16.596
(laughing)

34:19.683 --> 34:23.978
But was it, um,
something you liked

34:24.021 --> 34:26.023
and got out of your system?

34:26.063 --> 34:30.527
Or something you liked
and-and want to do again?

34:32.529 --> 34:34.239
Something I wanna do again.

34:36.199 --> 34:39.077
So, what does that mean?

34:39.118 --> 34:41.246
Just that you kind of dig me.

34:41.286 --> 34:43.540
Hmm...

34:43.581 --> 34:47.627
And that if I asked you out on
a date, you'd probably say yes.

34:49.045 --> 34:52.382
So, you wanna go out on a date?

35:01.975 --> 35:03.518
That would be a yes.

35:03.560 --> 35:05.103
(giggles)

35:08.607 --> 35:10.275
(giggling)

35:20.535 --> 35:23.288
(alternative pop song plays)

35:23.329 --> 35:24.915
â™ª Oh, sometimes we fight â™ª

35:24.957 --> 35:27.751
â™ª But when we're lovin',
we make it right â™ª

35:27.793 --> 35:30.128
â™ª I might not always
shave my legs â™ª

35:30.169 --> 35:32.923
â™ª Sometimes my baby's
gotta beg â™ª

35:32.965 --> 35:34.925
â™ª I leave the dishes
in the sink â™ª

35:34.967 --> 35:37.469
â™ª I always ask you for a ring â™ª

35:37.510 --> 35:40.263
â™ª I text ya
about everything I do â™ª

35:40.305 --> 35:42.599
â™ª I always miss you
after just seeing you â™ª

35:42.641 --> 35:44.517
â™ª That's how I know
that you love me â™ª

35:44.559 --> 35:46.311
â™ª That's how I know
that you care â™ª

35:46.352 --> 35:50.107
â™ª That's how I know that you
want me... â™ª

35:50.189 --> 35:51.024
(grunts)

35:59.658 --> 36:02.160
All right, you're right.

36:02.201 --> 36:04.788
You said I was jealous
and I am, okay?

36:04.830 --> 36:07.124
You win.

36:07.165 --> 36:10.710
I tried to tell you, but you
were like, "I can handle this."

36:10.752 --> 36:12.337
Whatever.

36:12.378 --> 36:16.091
I'm sorry,
I just don't get it.

36:16.133 --> 36:19.385
You make this huge play
to be with me and then now

36:19.427 --> 36:21.429
you're just willing
to throw it all away

36:21.471 --> 36:24.474
because I made one incredibly
stupid jealous mistake.

36:24.516 --> 36:26.059
What's going on?

36:26.101 --> 36:28.895
I don't know, I just...

36:28.937 --> 36:32.024
I don't know.

36:32.065 --> 36:33.817
What if it wasn't a mistake?

36:33.859 --> 36:34.985
What if you're right?

36:35.027 --> 36:36.820
What do you mean?

36:36.862 --> 36:39.656
I didn't have to go
to that coffeehouse.

36:39.698 --> 36:41.282
I could've just emailed her,

36:41.324 --> 36:43.660
but instead I left
the door wide open.

36:43.702 --> 36:45.996
Yeah, but nothing happened.

36:46.038 --> 36:47.706
It could have.

36:47.747 --> 36:51.168
Anything could happen
to anyone at any moment.

36:51.209 --> 36:52.502
I'm not just
anyone, Silver.

36:52.544 --> 36:55.922
I'm Spence Montgomery's son.

36:55.964 --> 36:59.425
My dad's had four wives
and cheated on all of them.

36:59.467 --> 37:02.345
You're not your father.

37:02.387 --> 37:03.930
How do you know?

37:03.972 --> 37:05.431
I don't even know.

37:05.473 --> 37:08.101
I've never cared enough about
a girl to stay faithful before.

37:09.853 --> 37:10.896
(rueful chuckle)

37:10.937 --> 37:13.106
But I care about you a lot.

37:15.316 --> 37:18.153
And I'd hate myself
if I ever cheated on you.

37:23.575 --> 37:25.451
I trust you.

37:43.929 --> 37:45.847
(grunts)

37:45.889 --> 37:48.225
(giggling, squealing)

37:48.266 --> 37:50.102
(laughing)

37:55.774 --> 37:57.192
All right, now, I'm warning you,

37:57.234 --> 37:59.652
I'm not really good
with this emotional stuff.

37:59.694 --> 38:01.696
Where you think
you get that from?

38:01.738 --> 38:03.240
It is genetic.

38:03.281 --> 38:04.908
(laughing)

38:04.950 --> 38:07.410
All right, well, I'll call you.

38:07.452 --> 38:08.745
I promise. Every week.

38:08.787 --> 38:12.415
Yeah, and maybe we can Skype
and watch a game together.

38:12.457 --> 38:14.918
Okay, I'm not sure

38:14.960 --> 38:16.253
what that means, but...

38:16.294 --> 38:17.587
sounds like fun.

38:17.629 --> 38:20.799
Oh, I... you know,
I almost forgot.

38:25.137 --> 38:26.930
What's this?

38:26.972 --> 38:28.514
Well, we won the bet.

38:28.556 --> 38:30.267
Yeah, that's your half,

38:30.308 --> 38:32.769
plus a little something extra
to make up for all the missed

38:32.811 --> 38:35.647
birthdays and Christmases and
visits from the tooth fairy.

38:35.688 --> 38:37.690
(chuckles)

38:47.408 --> 38:49.995
Okay, I'll see you, son.

38:55.000 --> 38:57.877
â™ª â™ª

39:16.771 --> 39:17.897
Hey.

39:17.939 --> 39:19.524
You know where
all my shirts went?

39:19.565 --> 39:21.693
Well, I thought since you're
gonna be staying here

39:21.734 --> 39:24.279
for a little while,
you should have a drawer.
Well, thank you.

39:24.321 --> 39:25.780
But all my drawers were filled,

39:25.822 --> 39:27.740
so I cleared you a space
underneath the bed.

39:27.782 --> 39:29.075
Oh, you are sweet.

39:30.660 --> 39:32.537
Mmm, I like playing house
with you.

39:32.578 --> 39:34.998
Really?
Mm-hmm.

39:35.040 --> 39:37.542
SILVER:
Well, this is a
little awkward.

39:37.583 --> 39:38.501
(giggles)

39:38.543 --> 39:40.670
You watching us?

39:40.712 --> 39:42.672
(chuckles)
Sorry.

39:42.714 --> 39:45.050
Uh, look, we just
want to talk to you

39:45.091 --> 39:46.676
about Mr. Cannon.

39:46.718 --> 39:49.304
Oh, that.
Don't worry, it's all good.

39:49.346 --> 39:52.015
Navid talked to him; he's agreed
to let me back on the Blaze.

39:52.057 --> 39:53.683
Isn't that great?

39:53.725 --> 39:57.478
Yeah, I guess, except
for everything he said.

39:57.520 --> 39:58.563
Nao, that stuff was awful.

39:58.604 --> 40:00.023
Yeah, you really

40:00.065 --> 40:02.400
can't let him get
away with it.
With what?

40:02.441 --> 40:05.237
What'd he say to you?
Oh, uh, it's
nothing, honey.

40:05.278 --> 40:07.364
No, I want to know
what happened.

40:07.405 --> 40:09.782
Cannon told her that she
could be back on the Blaze

40:09.824 --> 40:11.659
if she slept with him.

40:11.701 --> 40:13.661
What?!
It's okay.

40:13.703 --> 40:14.704
I got what I wanted.

40:14.746 --> 40:16.373
So, let's all just
forget about it.

40:16.414 --> 40:17.707
Forget about it?

40:17.749 --> 40:19.417
SILVER: You can't let him
get away with this.

40:19.458 --> 40:20.877
Come on, it's
sexual harassment.

40:20.919 --> 40:22.712
Naomi, come on.

40:22.754 --> 40:24.422
You gotta come forward.

40:24.463 --> 40:26.925
You don't want to be a doormat,
like both of our mothers were.

40:31.596 --> 40:34.473
(phone line ringing)

40:34.515 --> 40:37.227
(recording): This is Liam.
I'll call you back.

40:37.269 --> 40:39.896
Uh, h-hey, it's Annie.

40:39.938 --> 40:43.942
I just wanted to check in and,
uh, see how you're doing.

40:43.983 --> 40:46.903
'Cause we didn't get
a chance to talk earlier.

40:46.945 --> 40:49.197
If you need anything, call me.

40:49.239 --> 40:51.241
Bye.

40:51.283 --> 40:53.201
(chuckling sigh)

40:53.243 --> 40:54.411
(phone ringing)

40:54.452 --> 40:55.412
Hey.

40:55.453 --> 40:56.413
JASPER:
Annie.

40:56.454 --> 40:58.415
Jasper.

40:58.456 --> 41:00.166
Look, I told you
to leave me alone.

41:00.208 --> 41:03.128
All right? What do I have to do
to get that through your head?

41:03.169 --> 41:07.966
Don't worry, I got the
message loud and clear.

41:08.007 --> 41:09.717
I just wanted to say good-bye.

41:09.759 --> 41:12.595
Are you going somewhere?

41:12.637 --> 41:16.266
You could say that.

41:16.308 --> 41:18.935
Listen, if I can't be with you,

41:18.977 --> 41:21.271
there's no point in living.

41:21.313 --> 41:22.772
Bye, Annie.

41:22.814 --> 41:24.316
Jasper, no, don't...

41:24.357 --> 41:25.817
(sighs)
