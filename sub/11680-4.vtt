something isn't right.

35:58.501 --> 36:00.434
<i>actually, i think
it's you that screwed up.</i>

36:00.501 --> 36:02.401
You screwed up bad.

36:02.467 --> 36:03.567
[ sirens wailing ]

36:03.634 --> 36:05.234
Oh, here are the cops.
got to run.

36:05.300 --> 36:06.567
You're setting me up?

36:06.634 --> 36:08.401
Not used to being the guy
in the trap, are you?

36:08.467 --> 36:10.033
What made you think
you could piss off

36:10.100 --> 36:11.401
Every drug dealer
and cop in town

36:11.467 --> 36:12.933
And not get any payback?

36:13.000 --> 36:14.868
Oh, wait.
that's your problem --

36:14.933 --> 36:16.334
You don't think.

36:16.401 --> 36:17.900
Son of a bitch!

36:17.967 --> 36:19.501
Let's go.

36:37.834 --> 36:40.000
It's your lucky day,
bitch.

36:40.067 --> 36:42.768
I should get myself
a lottery ticket.

36:42.834 --> 36:45.367
And you should
get yourself a lawyer.

36:48.834 --> 36:51.234
Detective, found the other
getaway car on the street --

36:51.300 --> 36:53.768
It's a silver
'09 impala l.t.

36:53.834 --> 36:56.267
A silver impala?
are you sure?

36:56.334 --> 36:57.667
Yeah.

36:57.734 --> 36:59.967
You'll never believe
what we found in the trunk.

37:07.267 --> 37:09.401
Remember
my 200-to-1 shot?

37:09.467 --> 37:11.534
It's just
him and me now.

37:11.601 --> 37:12.933
Time to go straight,
tommy.

37:13.000 --> 37:15.267
If i ever see you
in a police computer again...

37:15.334 --> 37:17.067
You don't
have to worry about that.

37:17.134 --> 37:19.200
My mom's
back in saint louis.

37:19.267 --> 37:21.868
I was thinking, uh,
i might move there,

37:21.933 --> 37:23.768
Start a kennel
or something.

37:23.834 --> 37:26.000
Sounds good.

37:26.067 --> 37:27.234
Hey, thanks.

37:27.300 --> 37:30.467
The way you and your friends
had my back...

37:33.868 --> 37:36.167
I think you guys
are gonna be okay without me.

37:42.900 --> 37:45.601
[ footsteps approaching ]

37:48.234 --> 37:50.634
I closed
my biggest case today.

37:50.701 --> 37:53.234
Congratulations.
thanks.

37:53.300 --> 37:56.434
The thing is,
he was a master criminal

37:56.501 --> 37:58.634
Who managed to get stuck
in a locked meth lab

37:58.701 --> 38:01.033
With c-4 in a getaway car
parked outside.

38:01.100 --> 38:03.067
Wow.
tough break.

38:03.134 --> 38:04.501
Hmm.
the funny thing is,

38:04.567 --> 38:06.933
Is he's never been tied
to any cases with c-4.

38:07.000 --> 38:09.067
And that c-4
that was found in his trunk,

38:09.134 --> 38:11.933
It's the same used in seven
explosions in the miami area.

38:12.000 --> 38:13.467
Any thoughts?

38:13.534 --> 38:17.200
Well, it seems like you can
close the books on those cases,

38:17.267 --> 38:19.134
Or you can keep
coming after me

38:19.200 --> 38:21.467
And have the case
against matheson unravel.

38:23.267 --> 38:26.367
So i get matheson
and you get a free pass?

38:26.434 --> 38:29.134
If i got a pass,
which i'm not saying that i did,

38:29.200 --> 38:30.401
<i>it was anything but free.</i>

38:32.234 --> 38:35.868
It's like i told you, detective,
we're on the same side.

38:35.933 --> 38:38.567
[ sighs ]

38:42.300 --> 38:45.601
Just remember
where the line is, mr. westen.

38:45.667 --> 38:47.401
I will be watching you.

38:47.467 --> 38:49.134
I'd expect nothing less.

38:55.768 --> 38:57.534
Conolly:
thanks for your call, sam.

38:57.601 --> 38:58.601
Man...

38:58.667 --> 39:00.534
I was so mad at you.

39:00.601 --> 39:01.834
When your name
came across my desk,

39:01.900 --> 39:03.167
I thought, "this is it."

39:03.234 --> 39:05.067
"this is my chance
to get you back."

39:05.134 --> 39:06.634
Well, i'm glad
you found me.

39:06.701 --> 39:08.634
Yeah.

39:08.701 --> 39:10.367
I am, too.

39:10.434 --> 39:12.434
So, how
about another drink, sam?

39:12.501 --> 39:14.000
Coming right up.

39:15.667 --> 39:16.967
There you go.

39:17.033 --> 39:17.868
Okay.

39:20.567 --> 39:22.467
Is there alcohol in this?

39:22.534 --> 39:26.667
'cause it's masked by sort of
a, uh, peachy citrus flavor.

39:26.734 --> 39:27.834
It's called a fuzzy navel.

39:27.900 --> 39:29.200
It's not really
my kind of thing,

39:29.267 --> 39:30.634
But we got to
start you off easy,

39:30.701 --> 39:32.100
Work your way up
to the good stuff.

39:32.167 --> 39:33.601
I got to tell you, sam,
you're like a --

39:33.667 --> 39:34.900
You're like
a drinking genius here.

[ laughs ]

39:36.200 --> 39:37.334
I've forgotten more
about the subject

39:37.401 --> 39:38.334
Than you will ever know.

39:38.401 --> 39:39.701
[ high-pitched laugh ]

39:42.100 --> 39:44.367
[ clears throat ]

39:44.434 --> 39:45.601
If i'm in a bar

39:45.667 --> 39:47.067
And i can't get
the bartender's attention

39:47.134 --> 39:49.100
'cause i need some information
about a drink,

39:49.167 --> 39:50.933
Would it be okay
if i, uh...

39:51.000 --> 39:52.868
Would it be okay
if i call you?

39:52.933 --> 39:54.933
Absolutely, stacey.

39:55.000 --> 39:56.100
Anytime.

39:56.167 --> 39:57.933
Is this not
the best audit ever?

39:58.000 --> 40:00.667
[ both laugh ]

40:00.734 --> 40:03.900
I got rid
of the rest of the c-4.

40:03.967 --> 40:05.234
Such a waste.

40:05.300 --> 40:07.300
Small price to pay for
getting the cops off our back.

40:07.367 --> 40:09.000
Mm, i guess.

40:09.067 --> 40:10.300
Now that
we're in the clear,

40:10.367 --> 40:13.900
There's a few gigs
i've lined up for us.

40:13.967 --> 40:15.401
Fi, this isn't
a good time.

40:15.467 --> 40:16.801
Paxson's backing off,

40:16.868 --> 40:20.501
But we still have no idea
who's coming after me next.

40:20.567 --> 40:22.067
I still need back in.

40:24.234 --> 40:26.567
Michael,
priorities change.

40:26.634 --> 40:27.900
People change.

40:27.967 --> 40:31.834
Tommy always thought
he'd be a criminal.

40:31.900 --> 40:33.868
Maybe you'll find...

40:36.167 --> 40:38.267
You sure?

40:38.334 --> 40:39.768
I'm sure.

40:41.401 --> 40:44.334
I'm free of the people
who burned me.

40:44.401 --> 40:47.300
I'm clear of the cops.

This is the moment
i've been waiting for.

i've been waiting for, too.</i>
