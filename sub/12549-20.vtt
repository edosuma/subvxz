WEBVTT

00:06.927 --> 00:07.928
PREVIOUSLY ON "TWISTED"...

00:07.928 --> 00:09.180
DID YOU TAMPER
WITH VIKRAM'S CAR?

00:09.180 --> 00:10.221
THAT'S ABSURD.

00:10.221 --> 00:11.972
THEN WHY IS YOUR DNA
ALL OVER IT?

00:11.972 --> 00:14.515
MAYBE JACK ISN'T
SUCH A SAINT AFTER ALL.

00:14.515 --> 00:15.846
I HAD ANOTHER BABY.

00:15.846 --> 00:17.808
I KNOW WHERE HE KEPT
THE ADOPTION PAPERS.

00:17.808 --> 00:19.690
SHE DIED WHEN SHE WAS
ONLY TWO YEARS OLD.

00:19.690 --> 00:21.021
I BROUGHT YOU SOME PHOTOS.

00:21.021 --> 00:22.693
I DON'T THINK
THIS IS MY BABY.

00:24.405 --> 00:25.986
I'M STILL THINKING
ABOUT DANNY.

00:25.986 --> 00:27.528
OUCH.

00:27.528 --> 00:28.989
Kyle: WE FOUND VIKRAM'S
CELL PHONE IN THE BOAT HOUSE.

00:28.989 --> 00:30.361
IT'S CRACKED AND COVERED
IN DRIED BLOOD.

00:30.361 --> 00:31.612
YOU'RE THE ONE FRAMING HIM.

00:31.612 --> 00:33.954
AS FAR AS GOING DOWN
FOR MURDER, THAT'S ON YOU.

00:33.954 --> 00:36.867
DANNY WAS HERE.
HE BEAT ME UP PRETTY BAD.

00:36.867 --> 00:39.370
EVERYTHING THAT I HAVE DONE
HAS BEEN FOR YOU.

00:39.370 --> 00:41.792
- WHAT HAVE YOU DONE?
- WHEN I SAW WHAT HAPPENED--

00:41.792 --> 00:43.124
WHAT DO YOU MEAN,
WHEN YOU SAW WHAT HAPPENED?

00:43.124 --> 00:44.625
- OH MY GOD, I HAVE TO GO.
- WAIT! JO, JUST WAIT.

00:44.625 --> 00:46.667
- PLEASE.
- LET ME GO!

00:46.667 --> 00:48.629
CHIEF MASTERSON,
YOU'VE GOT THE WRONG GUY.

00:48.629 --> 00:50.341
- DID YOU MOVE THE BODY?
- NO, SIR.

00:50.341 --> 00:51.382
BUT I KNOW WHO DID.

00:51.382 --> 00:52.513
DANNY WAS HERE.

00:52.513 --> 00:53.884
HE CONFESSED
TO KILLING HIS FATHER.

00:53.884 --> 00:55.346
- DO YOU THINK THAT'S TRUE?
- I KNOW IT IS...

00:55.346 --> 00:56.517
BECAUSE I WAS THERE.

01:05.646 --> 01:07.608
( knocking at door )

01:08.819 --> 01:10.191
COMING.

01:22.163 --> 01:24.465
CHIEF MASTERSON.

01:26.377 --> 01:27.668
OH, YOU KNOW, JO--
JO WAS HERE,

01:27.668 --> 01:28.919
BUT THEN SHE, UM--
SHE LEFT.

01:28.919 --> 01:30.671
ACTUALLY,
I'M HERE TO SEE YOU.

01:33.053 --> 01:34.675
- REALLY?
- YEAH.

01:34.675 --> 01:36.056
YOU AND I ARE GOING
TO TAKE A LITTLE RIDE...

01:36.056 --> 01:37.718
IF THAT'S OKAY
WITH YOU, CHARLIE.

01:39.520 --> 01:41.682
Tess:
VIKRAM ATTACKED YOU.

01:41.682 --> 01:44.225
AND ATTACKED DANNY.
IT'S SELF-DEFENSE.

01:44.225 --> 01:46.066
WE DIDN'T THINK ANYONE
WOULD BELIEVE US.

01:46.066 --> 01:48.028
YOU FATHER DIDN'T SAY
ANYTHING ABOUT YOU.

01:48.028 --> 01:49.400
WELL, I GUESS DANNY
JUST WANTS TO PROTECT ME.

01:49.400 --> 01:51.192
BUT, MOM,
THE BODY WAS MOVED

01:51.192 --> 01:52.443
AND THE ACCIDENT
WAS STAGED.

01:52.443 --> 01:54.074
AND AT FIRST WE COULDN'T
FIGURE OUT WHO DID IT

01:54.074 --> 01:55.496
OR WHY THEY WOULD DO IT.

01:55.496 --> 01:58.078
BUT JACK'S IN JAIL.
YOUR FATHER HAS EVIDENCE.

01:58.078 --> 02:00.201
I KNOW. WE THOUGHT
IT WAS HIM TOO AT FIRST.

02:00.201 --> 02:01.742
WE EVEN THOUGHT IT MIGHT
BE MRS. DESAI,

02:01.742 --> 02:04.044
BUT IT WASN'T.
IT WAS CHARLIE.

02:04.044 --> 02:07.668
CHARLIE?
HE HAS SOMETHING
TO DO WITH THIS?

02:07.668 --> 02:09.630
WE THINK HE HAS
EVERYTHING TO DO WITH IT.

02:09.630 --> 02:13.424
CAN I ASK WHERE EXACTLY
IT IS THAT YOU'RE TAKING ME?

02:13.424 --> 02:15.055
YOU'LL SEE.

02:16.887 --> 02:18.058
SEE THIS GASH?

02:18.058 --> 02:20.181
YOU KNOW,
DANNY DID THIS TO ME.

02:20.181 --> 02:23.023
KNOWING DANNY,
HE HAD A GOOD REASON.

02:25.436 --> 02:27.728
YOU'RE NOT TAKING ME
TO THE POLICE STATION,

02:27.728 --> 02:30.030
ARE YOU?

02:30.030 --> 02:32.443
NO, SON, I'M NOT.

02:33.574 --> 02:36.947
( indistinct
police radio chatter )

02:36.947 --> 02:38.539
( indistinct chatter )

02:41.332 --> 02:43.334
RECOGNIZE THIS PLACE?

02:46.046 --> 02:48.048
LOOK...

02:48.048 --> 02:50.461
DANNY OBVIOUSLY
SAID SOMETHING TO YOU.

02:50.461 --> 02:51.922
HEY, I'M JUST
FOLLOWING UP.

02:51.922 --> 02:54.675
I MEAN, YOU'RE OKAY
TALKING ABOUT THIS, RIGHT?

02:54.675 --> 02:57.177
YEAH. YEAH, I GOT
NOTHING TO HIDE.

02:57.177 --> 02:59.260
EXACTLY.

02:59.260 --> 03:01.802
SO DANNY CLAIMS THIS IS
WHERE VIKRAM DESAI DIED.

03:01.802 --> 03:05.015
HE SAYS HE HIT HIM
AND IT SENT HIM
OFF THAT CLIFF.

03:05.015 --> 03:08.018
HE'S ALSO CONVINCED

03:08.018 --> 03:11.021
THAT YOU WERE
A WITNESS TO THE CRIME.

03:13.814 --> 03:15.906
HERE'S THE DEAL, CHARLIE:

03:15.906 --> 03:17.948
YOU CAN EITHER ANSWER
MY QUESTIONS HERE

03:17.948 --> 03:19.620
OR I CAN TAKE YOU DOWN
TO THE POLICE STATION,

03:19.620 --> 03:21.201
ARREST YOU, WE CAN
BRING IN THE ATTORNEYS

03:21.201 --> 03:22.913
AND SORT IT OUT FORMALLY.

03:22.913 --> 03:25.286
OKAY. I WAS THERE.

03:25.286 --> 03:26.497
IN THE WOODS,
I SAW THEM.

03:26.497 --> 03:28.088
DANNY AND HIS DAD,

03:28.088 --> 03:30.751
THEY WERE ARGUING,
AND THEN...

03:30.751 --> 03:32.092
DANNY HIT HIM.

03:32.092 --> 03:33.294
AND HE FELL.

03:33.294 --> 03:36.717
WAS IT SELF-DEFENSE,
CHARLIE?

03:39.890 --> 03:41.972
LOOK, CHIEF...

03:43.264 --> 03:45.606
I DIDN'T COME FORWARD
ORIGINALLY,

03:45.606 --> 03:47.978
BECAUSE I KNEW THAT
I WOULD GET IN TROUBLE.

03:47.978 --> 03:51.231
BUT MAYBE YOU AND I,
WE CAN...

03:51.231 --> 03:53.023
MAKE A DEAL HERE.

03:53.023 --> 03:55.115
OH, LET ME GUESS--
YOU WANT IMMUNITY

03:55.115 --> 03:57.618
IN EXCHANGE
FOR YOUR TESTIMONY.

03:57.618 --> 04:00.070
WHY DON'T WE START
BY YOU TELLING ME THE TRUTH

04:00.070 --> 04:01.121
ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED
THAT NIGHT,

04:01.121 --> 04:02.953
AND THEN WE'LL TALK?

04:06.957 --> 04:08.959
IT WASN'T SELF-DEFENSE.

04:08.959 --> 04:11.922
DANNY WAS IN A RAGE.

04:11.922 --> 04:14.835
I KNEW FROM JUVIE
HOW MUCH HE HATED HIS DAD

04:14.835 --> 04:17.007
FOR MAKING HIM TAKE THE FALL
FOR HIS AUNT'S DEATH, BUT...

04:18.379 --> 04:22.843
HE WAS IN...
A BLIND RAGE, SIR.

04:24.885 --> 04:27.688
WHY WERE YOU EVEN OUT HERE
IN THE FIRST PLACE?

04:29.650 --> 04:31.982
I WANTED TO SEE DANNY.

04:31.982 --> 04:33.984
I MEAN, I HADN'T--

04:33.984 --> 04:35.896
I HADN'T SEEN HIM
SINCE JUVIE.

04:35.896 --> 04:37.398
AND WHAT DID YOU THINK
WHEN YOU HEARD

04:37.398 --> 04:39.159
THE BODY WAS FOUND
IN A WRECKED CAR?

04:41.031 --> 04:43.203
I THOUGHT...

04:43.203 --> 04:44.745
"WOW.

04:44.745 --> 04:47.077
DANNY MUST HAVE MOVED
THE BODY."

04:47.077 --> 04:50.831
THANK YOU FOR YOUR
COOPERATION, CHARLIE.

04:50.831 --> 04:53.964
I CERTAINLY WILL CONSIDER
WHAT YOU SAID.

04:53.964 --> 04:57.047
THERE IS ONE MORE THING.

04:59.009 --> 05:01.011
STAY THE HELL AWAY
FROM MY DAUGHTER.

05:03.053 --> 05:05.055
DO WE UNDERSTAND
EACH OTHER?

05:05.055 --> 05:07.728
YES, SIR.

05:07.728 --> 05:09.890
( theme music playing )

05:15.896 --> 05:19.239
DANNY THINKS
YOU HAVE NOTHING TO DO
WITH ANY OF THIS.

05:19.239 --> 05:21.612
DO YOU BELIEVE HIM?

05:21.612 --> 05:23.864
YEAH. I THINK I DO.

05:23.864 --> 05:25.946
BUT YOU STILL WANT ME
TO CONFESS.

05:25.946 --> 05:28.208
NO, I WOULDN'T EXPECT THAT.

05:28.208 --> 05:30.120
WELL, YOU CAN HOPE,
RIGHT?

05:30.120 --> 05:31.952
JACK, HE'S MY SON.

05:31.952 --> 05:34.084
I'M GOING TO DO
DANNY A FAVOR

05:34.084 --> 05:36.256
AND I'M GOING TO LET HIM
DECIDE THE OUTCOME OF THIS

05:36.256 --> 05:37.798
BECAUSE I BELIEVE,
IN THE END,

05:37.798 --> 05:39.009
HE'S GOING TO DO
THE RIGHT THING, KAREN.

05:39.009 --> 05:40.881
YOU WANT HIM TO CONFESS.

05:40.881 --> 05:42.383
I WANT HIM TO PROVE TO YOU

05:42.383 --> 05:44.725
AND TO THE REST OF THE WORLD
THAT HE'S NOT HIS FATHER.

05:44.725 --> 05:46.346
AND IF CONFESSING
DOES THAT,

05:46.346 --> 05:47.968
THEN, YEAH, I WANT HIM
TO JUST DO IT.

05:47.968 --> 05:49.059
PUT HIS FAITH IN--

05:49.059 --> 05:50.971
IN WHAT? GOD?

05:50.971 --> 05:52.352
THE POLICE?

05:52.352 --> 05:53.934
I WAS GOING TO SAY
IN THE TRUTH,

05:53.934 --> 05:55.816
'CAUSE RIGHT NOW,
THAT'S ALL THE KID HAS.

05:55.816 --> 05:57.608
JUST LIKE ME, RIGHT?

06:02.613 --> 06:04.535
( handcuffs click )

06:09.249 --> 06:10.411
( elevator dings )

06:13.043 --> 06:15.996
OH, UH, MRS. DESAI,
CHIEF MASTERSON IS
LOOKING FOR YOU.

06:15.996 --> 06:17.708
- ABOUT JACK?
- IT'S ABOUT DANNY.

06:17.708 --> 06:19.089
( sighs )

06:23.303 --> 06:25.886
NOTHING GOES PUBLIC--
HIS ARREST, HIS CONFESSION.

06:25.886 --> 06:28.469
NOTHING. AND KEEP THE DAMN
PRESS AWAY FROM THE RAVINE.

06:28.469 --> 06:30.060
ONCE THAT GETS OUT
IN THE OPEN,

06:30.060 --> 06:31.101
IT'S GONNA BE A CIRCUS.

06:31.101 --> 06:33.313
YOU ARRESTED HIM?
HE'S IN CUSTODY?

06:33.313 --> 06:35.516
( sighs ) LOOK, EVERYBODY
KNOWS WHAT THEY HAVE TO DO.

06:35.516 --> 06:37.277
GET GOING.
IN HERE, PLEASE.

06:39.980 --> 06:41.902
DANNY CONFESSED
TO KILLING VIKRAM

06:41.902 --> 06:44.825
IN THE WOODS OUT
BY THE OLD POST CHURCH.

06:44.825 --> 06:47.117
HE SAYS THEY WERE ALONE.

06:49.119 --> 06:51.121
THAT'S INSANE.

06:55.205 --> 06:57.748
IS THIS THE FIRST TIME
YOU'VE HEARD THIS?

06:57.748 --> 06:59.089
WHAT?

06:59.089 --> 07:02.092
HAS DANNY EVER TALKED
ABOUT KILLING HIS FATHER?

07:02.092 --> 07:03.924
NO, OF COURSE NOT.

07:03.924 --> 07:05.886
OH MY GOD.

07:05.886 --> 07:07.387
I CAN'T BELIEVE
THIS IS HAPPENING.

07:07.387 --> 07:08.889
YOU KNOW I BELIEVE
IN MY HEART

07:08.889 --> 07:10.140
THAT DANNY
IS A GOOD KID.

07:10.140 --> 07:12.102
AND SO FAR HE'S BEEN
VERY COOPERATIVE.

07:12.102 --> 07:14.815
AND EVEN THOUGH
HE'S STILL A MINOR,

07:14.815 --> 07:17.437
THE CIRCUMSTANCES ARE...

07:17.437 --> 07:19.189
HE COULD BE TRIED
AS AN ADULT.

07:19.189 --> 07:21.231
BUT I WANT YOU TO KNOW
THAT I WILL DO EVERYTHING

07:21.231 --> 07:23.023
TO PROTECT HIM AND MAKE SURE
HE IS FAIRLY TREATED

07:23.023 --> 07:24.114
UNDER THE LAW.

07:24.114 --> 07:25.526
YOU UNDERSTAND THAT,
RIGHT?

07:27.067 --> 07:29.199
YEAH, I UNDERSTAND.

07:31.662 --> 07:33.033
MAY I SEE HIM?

07:33.033 --> 07:35.075
OF COURSE. I'LL TAKE YOU
UP THERE RIGHT NOW.

07:36.627 --> 07:38.458
THANKS, KYLE.

07:40.881 --> 07:43.083
( indistinct chatter )

07:43.083 --> 07:44.885
( door opens )

07:44.885 --> 07:46.507
EXCUSE US.
KAREN.

07:46.507 --> 07:48.178
WE'RE HERE TO SEE KYLE.

07:48.178 --> 07:50.470
ANDERSON, WILL YOU
PLEASE ESCORT MRS. DESAI
UP TO SEE HER SON?

07:50.470 --> 07:52.933
( door closes )

07:52.933 --> 07:54.685
WE'LL NEED YOUR OFFICE
FOR THIS.

08:01.902 --> 08:03.483
( door opens )

08:09.950 --> 08:11.411
I HAD TO DO IT, MOM.

08:23.083 --> 08:26.086
YOU TOLD THEM
YOU WERE ALONE.

08:26.086 --> 08:28.178
THAT'S WHAT
SHOULD HAVE HAPPENED.

08:28.178 --> 08:31.011
I SHOULD HAVE BEEN ALONE.

08:31.011 --> 08:33.513
TESS AND JO
JUST GOT HERE.

08:33.513 --> 08:36.056
I'M GUESSING JO
IS CONFESSING SHE WAS THERE.

08:36.056 --> 08:37.517
( sighs )
I DIDN'T WANT THAT.

08:37.517 --> 08:39.900
WHY? SHE'LL TESTIFY
IT WAS SELF-DEFENSE.

08:39.900 --> 08:41.732
I JUST WANTED
TO KEEP HER OUT OF IT.

08:41.732 --> 08:43.644
I ALWAYS JUST WANTED TO--

08:43.644 --> 08:45.946
WELL, RIGHT NOW SHE'S
THE BEST CHANCE YOU'VE GOT.

08:48.108 --> 08:49.910
Tess:
WHERE DID THEY TAKE HER?

08:49.910 --> 08:51.281
AN INTERVIEW ROOM.

08:51.281 --> 08:52.863
SHE'S BEING INTERROGATED
BY A FEMALE DETECTIVE.

08:52.863 --> 08:54.995
I'M NOT ALLOWED
BECAUSE I'M HER FATHER.

08:54.995 --> 08:56.246
WE COULD HAVE
WORKED THIS OUT...

08:56.246 --> 08:57.618
AS A FAMILY.

08:57.618 --> 08:59.119
THAT'S NOT PROCEDURE.

08:59.119 --> 09:01.541
TO HELL WITH PROCEDURE!

09:01.541 --> 09:03.624
FOR ONCE,
TAKE OFF YOUR COP HAT

09:03.624 --> 09:05.545
AND THINK LIKE A DAD.

09:05.545 --> 09:07.467
OUR DAUGHTER HAS BEEN
LYING TO US FOR WEEKS.

09:07.467 --> 09:09.169
SHE'S A WITNESS
TO A MAJOR CRIME,

09:09.169 --> 09:10.721
AN ACCESSORY
AFTER THE FACT--

09:10.721 --> 09:12.262
PLUS SHE LEFT A BODY
IN THE WOODS.

09:12.262 --> 09:14.635
I DIDN'T HAVE A CHOICE!

09:14.635 --> 09:17.227
BUT I'M GOING TO HELP HER
AND GET HER THE HELL
OUT OF HERE.

09:27.688 --> 09:30.901
WHAT DANNY DID
HAD TO BE SELF-DEFENSE.

09:30.901 --> 09:33.033
THE ONLY PROBLEM IS I'VE GOT
A WITNESS WHO SAYS IT
WASN'T SELF-DEFENSE.

09:33.033 --> 09:36.997
AND THEN THERE'S
THE ISSUE OF THEM NOT
COMING FORWARD RIGHT AWAY.

09:36.997 --> 09:38.118
DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA
HOW MUCH EASIER

09:38.118 --> 09:39.159
THIS WOULD HAVE BEEN
IF THEY HAD?

09:39.159 --> 09:41.581
OKAY. I GET IT.

09:43.543 --> 09:45.796
YOU'RE IN A TOUGH POSITION.

09:45.796 --> 09:47.167
WE ALL ARE.

09:47.167 --> 09:51.591
HE WOULD HAVE HURT ME
IF DANNY HADN'T STEPPED IN.

09:51.591 --> 09:55.636
AND I THINK THAT HE
WANTED TO KILL DANNY, TOO.

09:55.636 --> 09:56.677
THANK YOU, JO.

09:56.677 --> 09:58.098
IF ANYTHING ELSE
COMES TO MIND,

09:58.098 --> 09:59.640
I'M AVAILABLE 24/7.

09:59.640 --> 10:01.892
I'M SURE JO APPRECIATES
THAT, KATE. THANKS.

10:01.892 --> 10:04.104
CHIEF MASTERSON,
I'VE OBTAINED A RELEASE FOR JO

10:04.104 --> 10:05.105
INTO YOUR CUSTODY.

10:05.105 --> 10:06.606
THERE ARE SOME FORMS.

10:06.606 --> 10:08.989
IN MY OFFICE.
THE DESK SERGEANT
WILL HELP YOU.

10:08.989 --> 10:10.781
OKAY.

10:16.076 --> 10:17.868
( door closes )

10:17.868 --> 10:21.001
DAD, I'M REALLY SORRY
I DIDN'T SAY ANYTHING EARLIER.

10:21.001 --> 10:22.542
I JUST--

10:22.542 --> 10:24.875
I KNOW THAT I PUT YOU
IN A REALLY BAD PLACE,
AND I'M...

10:30.590 --> 10:32.012
I'M REALLY SORRY.

10:59.870 --> 11:01.621
( door opens )

11:14.054 --> 11:15.635
YOU'RE NOT ALLOWED
TO LEAVE THE CITY LIMITS,

11:15.635 --> 11:16.636
OPERATE A MOTOR VEHICLE,
OR BE OUT AFTER 10:00 P.M.

11:16.636 --> 11:17.718
OKAY.

11:17.718 --> 11:20.100
WHEN ARE YOU GOING
TO ARREST CHARLIE?

11:20.100 --> 11:22.012
HE LIED ABOUT WHAT
HE SAW AT THE RAVINE.

11:22.012 --> 11:24.104
DANNY, STOP WITH ALL THIS.
THEY'RE LETTING YOU GO.

11:24.104 --> 11:25.605
I'M NOT
GONNA STOP, OKAY?

11:25.605 --> 11:27.267
SOMETHING HAS
TO BE DONE HERE.

11:27.267 --> 11:28.899
FORENSICS FOUND
NOTHING AT THE RAVINE,

11:28.899 --> 11:30.230
NOTHING AT THE CHURCH.

11:30.230 --> 11:32.442
SO EVEN WITH YOUR CONFESSION,
YOU MAY JUST WALK.

11:32.442 --> 11:34.074
- I DON'T CARE.
- OH, YES, YOU DO.

11:34.074 --> 11:36.526
LOOK, I JUST NEED TO KNOW
WHAT'S GOING ON WITH CHARLIE.

11:36.526 --> 11:38.078
YOU JUST LEAVE THAT TO ME.
AND JUST SO YOU KNOW,

11:38.078 --> 11:39.699
ANY CONTACT
WITH CHARLIE McBRIDE

11:39.699 --> 11:41.701
COULD BE INTERPRETED
AS THREATENING A WITNESS.

11:41.701 --> 11:42.953
SAME GOES FOR JO.

11:42.953 --> 11:44.825
SO GIVE YOUR CAR KEYS
TO YOUR MOTHER,

11:44.825 --> 11:47.958
AND THEN IT'S HOME, SCHOOL,
THE LIBRARY-- THAT'S IT.

11:47.958 --> 11:49.419
NOWHERE ELSE.
UNDERSTOOD?

11:49.419 --> 11:50.460
HE UNDERSTANDS.
LET'S GO.

11:52.002 --> 11:53.253
( door opens )

11:59.840 --> 12:01.141
HEY.

12:01.141 --> 12:03.053
NO NO NO NO.
NO CONTACT.

12:03.053 --> 12:05.145
CHIEF MASTERSON
JUST SAID SO.

12:05.145 --> 12:06.346
MRS. DESAI, PLEASE.

12:06.346 --> 12:08.939
I MEAN, I CAME FORWARD
FOR DANNY.

12:08.939 --> 12:11.231
MY DAD KNOWS THAT.
SO DO YOU.

12:11.231 --> 12:12.612
( sighs )
FINE.

12:12.612 --> 12:14.194
I'LL WAIT IN THE CAR.

12:17.237 --> 12:19.119
I REALLY DIDN'T WANT
TO INVOLVE YOU IN THIS.

12:19.119 --> 12:20.320
I KNOW THAT.

12:20.320 --> 12:22.412
I KIND OF DIDN'T
HAVE A CHOICE, THOUGH.

12:22.412 --> 12:24.955
YOU WERE RIGHT
ABOUT CHARLIE.

12:24.955 --> 12:26.867
I SHOULD HAVE LISTENED
TO YOU.

12:26.867 --> 12:29.419
I-- I WANT TO APOLOGIZE.

12:29.419 --> 12:31.211
NO, IT DOESN'T--
IT DOESN'T MATTER.

12:31.211 --> 12:33.874
YOUR DAD BELIEVES ME,
AND YOU...

12:35.505 --> 12:38.428
HE'S GOING TO NAIL CHARLIE.
I'M SURE OF IT.

12:38.428 --> 12:41.051
I SAW HIS FACE.

12:41.051 --> 12:43.263
WHOSE-- WHOSE FACE?

12:43.263 --> 12:45.685
CHARLIE'S,
WHAT YOU DID TO HIS FACE.

12:45.685 --> 12:47.147
I DIDN'T DO ANYTHING
TO HIM.

12:47.147 --> 12:48.768
WE GOT INTO AN ARGUMENT.

12:48.768 --> 12:51.021
I PUSHED HIM,
BUT I DIDN'T HIT HIM.

12:52.392 --> 12:54.024
I BELIEVE YOU.

12:54.024 --> 12:56.566
THANK YOU.

12:59.239 --> 13:01.451
I WAS VISITING MY DAD
AT THE JAIL WHEN I HEARD.

13:01.451 --> 13:02.823
Rico: WAIT WAIT WAIT--
LET ME GET THIS STRAIGHT.

13:02.823 --> 13:05.165
DANNY CAME INTO THE JAIL
AND CONFESSED SOMETHING,

13:05.165 --> 13:06.616
AND THEN JO CAME
AND CONFESSED SOMETHING.

13:06.616 --> 13:08.078
BUT WE DON'T KNOW WHAT.

13:08.078 --> 13:10.460
HI, MOM.

13:10.460 --> 13:13.673
WHITNEY... LACEY'S MOTHER
TOLD ME YOU GUYS WOULD BE HERE.

13:13.673 --> 13:15.375
- NICE TO MEET YOU.
- OH.

13:15.375 --> 13:17.467
THANK YOU FOR YOUR
FAMILY'S HOSPITALITY.

13:17.467 --> 13:18.468
OH, YEAH.

13:18.468 --> 13:20.180
I WOULD LOVE
TO STAY AND CHAT

13:20.180 --> 13:22.222
WITH ALL OF WHITNEY'S
NEW FRIENDS,

13:22.222 --> 13:23.383
BUT THERE'S NO TIME, KIDS.

13:23.383 --> 13:25.055
WHITNEY, DEAR.
I'VE COME TO TAKE YOU HOME.

13:25.055 --> 13:27.687
THIS UGLINESS
WITH YOUR FATHER

13:27.687 --> 13:29.229
HAS MADE IT IMPOSSIBLE
FOR YOU TO STAY HERE.

13:29.229 --> 13:32.522
YEAH, A MURDER CHARGE
IS UGLY, ALL RIGHT.

13:32.522 --> 13:35.065
YOUR FATHER IS CERTAINLY
UNPREDICTABLE IF NOTHING ELSE.

13:35.065 --> 13:37.487
HE'S NOT A KILLER,
AND HE'S GOING TO GET OFF.

13:37.487 --> 13:38.698
WELL, WOULDN'T THAT
BE WONDERFUL.

13:38.698 --> 13:40.440
IN THE MEANTIME,
PACK YOUR BAG.

13:40.440 --> 13:43.203
WE'RE LEAVING
AFTER SCHOOL TOMORROW.

13:43.203 --> 13:45.285
I'M STAYING AT
THE GREEN GROVE HOTEL TONIGHT.

13:45.285 --> 13:47.787
WHY DON'T YOU AND LACEY
JOIN ME FOR DINNER?

13:47.787 --> 13:49.870
JUST THE THREE OF US.
IT'LL BE FUN.

13:49.870 --> 13:52.002
ACTUALLY, WE HAVE
OTHER PLANS.

13:52.002 --> 13:53.043
SORRY, MOM.

13:53.043 --> 13:54.875
WHATEVER.

13:54.875 --> 13:57.667
LACEY, NICE TO MEET YOU.

13:57.667 --> 13:58.668
YEP.

14:02.592 --> 14:06.096
WELL, I GUESS WE BETTER GET
BACK TO YOUR PLACE AND PACK.

14:06.096 --> 14:08.098
YEAH, MAN, I CAN'T BELIEVE
YOU'RE LEAVING ALREADY.

14:08.098 --> 14:09.429
STORY OF MY LIFE.

14:09.429 --> 14:11.061
ONCE I START
TO LIKE A PLACE,

14:11.061 --> 14:13.183
ON TO THE NEXT.
BYE, GUYS.

14:13.183 --> 14:14.814
Both: BYE.

14:17.147 --> 14:18.398
( sighs )

14:18.398 --> 14:19.940
WOW, A LOT OF DRAMA
THIS MORNING.

14:19.940 --> 14:22.032
YEAH.

14:22.032 --> 14:24.194
THIS'LL PALE
IN COMPARISON.

14:24.194 --> 14:26.246
MY PARENTS
WANT TO MEET YOU.

14:26.246 --> 14:29.449
THEY'RE REALLY
WARMING UP TO THE IDEA
OF YOU AND ME TOGETHER.

14:29.449 --> 14:31.331
DIDN'T YOU SAY
YOUR PARENTS WERE
KIND OF STRICT?

14:31.331 --> 14:33.043
I'M HOPING THIS
IS A FIRST STEP,

14:33.043 --> 14:34.874
YOU KNOW, TO GET THEM
TO START LIGHTENING UP.

14:34.874 --> 14:36.876
OKAY, YEAH.
DON'T WORRY.

14:36.876 --> 14:38.048
I'LL BE
AT MY MOST CHARMING.

14:38.048 --> 14:39.549
I KNOW YOU WILL.

14:44.965 --> 14:47.767
HEY.

14:47.767 --> 14:49.179
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

14:49.179 --> 14:50.810
MY DAD TOLD YOU
TO STAY AWAY FROM ME.

14:50.810 --> 14:52.272
YEAH YEAH YEAH.
HE DID.

14:52.272 --> 14:53.563
BUT, LOOK, JO-- I MEAN,
YOU GOT THE WRONG IMPRESSION.

14:53.563 --> 14:55.145
- GO AWAY, CHARLIE.
- NO.

14:55.145 --> 14:57.857
LOOK, YOUR DAD--
HE TOOK ME TO THAT RAVINE

14:57.857 --> 14:59.319
AND I WAS CORNERED,
YOU KNOW.

14:59.319 --> 15:00.730
I HAD TO SAY SOMETHING.

15:00.730 --> 15:02.322
ALL YOU HAD TO DO
WAS TELL THE TRUTH.

15:02.322 --> 15:03.733
YOU KNOW
IT WAS SELF-DEFENSE.

15:03.733 --> 15:05.155
OKAY, LOOK,
I LEFT YOU OUT OF IT

15:05.155 --> 15:06.786
TO PROTECT YOU.

15:06.786 --> 15:08.328
I MEAN, YOU SHOULDN'T
HAVE COME FORWARD, JO.

15:08.328 --> 15:10.080
I HAD TO... FOR DANNY.

15:10.080 --> 15:12.202
( chuckles )

15:12.202 --> 15:14.164
YEAH, FOR-- FOR DANNY.

15:14.164 --> 15:16.246
CHARLIE, YOU CAN STILL
GET YOURSELF OUT OF THIS.

15:16.246 --> 15:17.747
JUST GO TO MY DAD
AND TELL HIM THAT YOU LIED.

15:17.747 --> 15:19.879
IT'S NOT THAT EASY,
YOU KNOW.

15:19.879 --> 15:21.171
I HAVE TO THINK ABOUT IT.
I JUST--

15:21.171 --> 15:23.173
DANNY NEVER HIT YOU.

15:23.173 --> 15:24.424
YOU DID THAT TO YOURSELF.

15:24.424 --> 15:26.136
YOU DON'T THINK THAT.

15:28.258 --> 15:32.102
OKAY.
UM, LET ME EXPLAIN.

15:32.102 --> 15:36.016
- GOODBYE, CHARLIE.
- LOOK, I'M SORRY! OKAY?

15:36.016 --> 15:37.227
I'M SORRY.

15:38.398 --> 15:41.191
JUST...
GO FIND YOUR OWN LIFE

15:41.191 --> 15:43.823
AND STAY OUT OF MINE.

15:51.161 --> 15:52.282
Whitney: DON'T WORRY.
I'M GETTING USED TO IT.

15:52.282 --> 15:54.914
NEW TEACHERS,
NEW FRIENDS.

15:54.914 --> 15:57.417
ON TO THE NEXT
NIGHTMARE.

15:57.417 --> 16:00.460
MY MOM'S NOT EVEN LETTING
ME FINISH THE SCHOOL DAY.

16:00.460 --> 16:03.383
SHE'D SHIP ME OUT
U.P.S. IF SHE COULD.

16:05.135 --> 16:07.387
( sighs )

16:07.387 --> 16:10.010
YOU-- I MEAN, YOU SEEM
TO LIKE THE CITY.

16:10.010 --> 16:11.351
YEAH, DON'T GET ME WRONG.

16:11.351 --> 16:13.893
IT'S THE GREATEST
CITY IN THE WORLD.

16:13.893 --> 16:16.186
I'M JUST NOT IN LOVE
WITH SOME--

16:16.186 --> 16:18.358
ONE OF ITS INHABITANTS.

16:18.358 --> 16:20.190
YOUR MOM?

16:21.651 --> 16:26.446
NO, ACTUALLY, HER SCUZZY,
TOFU-OBSESSED BOY TOY.

16:28.028 --> 16:30.200
HE CAME ON TO ME.

16:30.200 --> 16:31.451
WHAT?

16:31.451 --> 16:33.533
THAT'S WHY MY DAD
LET ME STAY HERE.

16:33.533 --> 16:36.876
TO KEEP ME AWAY
FROM THAT JERK.

16:36.876 --> 16:39.419
BUT NOW MY DAD'S IN JAIL
AND MY MOM WON'T LISTEN TO ME.

16:39.419 --> 16:42.382
WELL, MAYBE
SHE'LL LISTEN TO ME.

16:42.382 --> 16:43.883
JUST FORGET ABOUT IT, LACE.

16:49.049 --> 16:51.341
I SHOULD'VE
COME FORWARD RIGHT AWAY,

16:51.341 --> 16:53.973
PROBABLY WHEN
IT HAPPENED, BUT--

16:53.973 --> 16:55.515
AND I JUST
LET YOU SIT IN THERE.

16:55.515 --> 16:58.478
STOP. YOU DID
THE RIGHT THING, DANNY.

16:59.689 --> 17:01.401
THANKS.

17:02.982 --> 17:05.735
ESPECIALLY FOR--
FOR NOT SAYING ANYTHING.

17:05.735 --> 17:08.608
SOMETIMES KEEPING QUIET'S
THE ONLY WAY TO GO.

17:10.150 --> 17:11.741
YOU AND JO SURE DID,

17:11.741 --> 17:13.243
A LONG TIME.

17:15.075 --> 17:16.416
HOW'S THAT GOING,
BY THE WAY?

17:16.416 --> 17:18.538
( sighs )
I DON'T KNOW.

17:20.420 --> 17:21.711
I GOT HIGH HOPES.

17:21.711 --> 17:23.543
NOTHING WRONG WITH HOPE.

17:23.543 --> 17:26.966
I JUST GOT A GOOD DOSE
OF IT MYSELF.

17:26.966 --> 17:29.669
Jo:
THROUGH ALL OF IT, I JUST TRIED
TO KEEP EVERYTHING INSIDE.

17:31.050 --> 17:33.433
LYING TO SO MANY PEOPLE
WAS REALLY HARD.

17:33.433 --> 17:35.475
IT WAS HARD FOR DANNY, TOO.

17:36.476 --> 17:39.309
- WOW. THAT...
- ( sighs )

17:39.309 --> 17:41.101
I MEAN, THAT EXPLAINS
A LOT, YOU KNOW?

17:41.101 --> 17:43.443
LIKE WHY YOU WERE
THROWING YOURSELF
INTO SO MANY THINGS.

17:44.734 --> 17:47.357
I MEAN, I JUST WANTED
YOU GUYS TO BE HAPPY,

17:47.357 --> 17:49.779
LIKE YOU WITH ANDIE
AND DANNY WITH LACEY.

17:49.779 --> 17:51.781
AND THEN EVERYONE STARTED
TO FIGURE EVERYTHING OUT

17:53.533 --> 17:56.786
BUT I'M GLAD,
'CAUSE CONFESSING FELT...

17:56.786 --> 17:58.248
REALLY GOOD.

18:00.330 --> 18:02.752
I KNEW SOMETHING
WAS UP, TOO.
IT JUST--

18:02.752 --> 18:05.044
IT DIDN'T SEEM
LIKE YOU WANTED
TO LET ANYONE IN.

18:06.085 --> 18:08.047
YEAH, I DIDN'T...
WANT TO.

18:10.130 --> 18:12.132
BUT I NEEDED YOU
THROUGH THIS.

18:13.423 --> 18:15.555
YOU'RE THE ONLY PERSON
I REALLY WANTED TO TALK TO.

18:18.598 --> 18:21.851
UM, WELL,
YOU AND DANNY GOT CLOSE.

18:21.851 --> 18:22.892
THAT'S-- THAT'S GOOD.

18:23.893 --> 18:25.565
YEAH.

18:25.565 --> 18:27.187
WELL, I MEAN...

18:27.187 --> 18:29.489
WHEN YOU GO THROUGH SOMETHING
SO AWFUL WITH SOMEONE,

18:29.489 --> 18:30.650
IT JUST MAKES IT SEEM LIKE...

18:32.071 --> 18:34.073
THEY'RE THE ONLY PERSON
WHO CAN UNDERSTAND YOU.

18:34.073 --> 18:37.907
YEAH, THEN YOU PUSH
EACH OTHER AWAY TO AVOID
CONFRONTING IT,

18:37.907 --> 18:40.870
- BUT THERE'S LIKE
THIS INCREDIBLE BOND.
- EXACTLY.

18:42.081 --> 18:43.623
( sighs )

18:43.623 --> 18:45.915
OH GOD, I AM SO LATE.

18:45.915 --> 18:47.507
- OH MY GOD.
- WHAT?

18:47.507 --> 18:49.629
I'M-- I'M S-- I'M LATE

18:49.629 --> 18:51.171
FOR DINNER
WITH ANDIE'S PARENTS.

18:51.171 --> 18:53.513
- OH, OKAY.
IT'S-- GO, IT'S FINE.
- IS THAT--

18:53.513 --> 18:57.887
OKAY.
THANKS FOR SHARING ALL THAT.

18:57.887 --> 18:59.809
- UH...
- THANKS FOR LISTENING.

18:59.809 --> 19:01.641
OKAY.

19:02.642 --> 19:04.524
( door opens, closes )

19:06.476 --> 19:08.478
( indistinct chattering )

19:14.113 --> 19:17.237
OH. WHAT?
NO-- NO ROOM FOR DESSERT?

19:18.488 --> 19:20.870
UH, MR. AND MRS. DANG,
I'M RICO.

19:20.870 --> 19:22.081
I'M-- I'M REALLY SORRY
I'M LATE.

19:22.081 --> 19:23.413
A FRIEND OF MINE
WAS IN JAIL.

19:25.084 --> 19:27.917
SHE-- SHE'S NOT ANYMORE.
SHE JUST NEEDED SOMEONE
TO TALK TO.

19:27.917 --> 19:30.840
JO'S FINE. SHE'S GREAT.
I KNOW YOU WERE CONCERNED

19:30.840 --> 19:33.423
WOW, YOU GUYS ARE...
FAST EATERS.

19:33.423 --> 19:36.005
WELL, MOM AND DAD HAVE
A BIG DAY TOMORROW.

19:36.005 --> 19:38.638
WE'LL HAVE TO PICK
ANOTHER TIME, RIGHT, PETER?

19:38.638 --> 19:40.760
YES, VERY SOON.
NICE MEETING YOU, RICO.

19:40.760 --> 19:41.971
LET'S GO.

19:45.184 --> 19:46.806
I'M-- I'M--
I'M SORRY.

19:46.806 --> 19:50.230
IT'S OKAY.
DON'T WORRY.

19:50.230 --> 19:52.442
I'LL SEE YOU
AT SCHOOL TOMORROW.

19:53.863 --> 19:56.656
( sighs )

20:08.127 --> 20:10.089
- HEY.
- ( sighs )

20:10.089 --> 20:12.001
YOU KNOW THERE'S
A DOOR DOWNSTAIRS.

20:12.001 --> 20:15.425
THIS ISN'T A DOOR?
( chuckles )

20:16.386 --> 20:19.429
- I JUST WANTED TO SEE YOU.
- NOT MY DAD?

20:19.429 --> 20:21.050
NO, JUST YOU.

20:21.050 --> 20:23.843
CHARLIE TRIED
TO TALK TO ME TODAY.

20:23.843 --> 20:27.437
HE WAS TRYING TO BE...
APOLOGETIC.

20:27.437 --> 20:29.439
IS IT OKAY
IF WE DON'T TALK ABOUT HIM?

20:29.439 --> 20:32.442
I THINK AT THIS POINT
WE BOTH KNOW WHO HE IS.

20:32.442 --> 20:34.984
YEAH. WE DO.

20:36.316 --> 20:38.488
I COULDN'T WAIT
TO TELL YOU THIS.

20:39.739 --> 20:42.161
I KNOW THAT THINGS
GOT MESSED UP BETWEEN US,

20:42.161 --> 20:43.993
- AND-- JUST--
- DANNY, IT'S REALLY--

20:43.993 --> 20:46.075
CAN YOU JUST
LET ME FINISH, PLEASE?

20:46.075 --> 20:49.869
LACEY WAS RIGHT.
I JUST--

20:49.869 --> 20:51.631
I CAN'T STOP
THINKING ABOUT IT.

20:51.631 --> 20:54.043
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

20:55.755 --> 20:57.587
IT'S ALWAYS BEEN YOU, JO.

20:59.088 --> 21:01.551
EVEN IF THIS THING
WITH MY DAD NEVER HAPPENED...

21:03.683 --> 21:05.385
I WOULD STILL
HAVE THESE FEELINGS.

21:05.385 --> 21:07.437
- EVEN IF I TRIED
TO DENY THEM...
- PLEASE.

21:07.437 --> 21:09.188
- PLEASE.
- I THOUGHT THAT...

21:11.060 --> 21:15.525
MAYBE... ALL THAT WE WOULD
EVER BE IS JUST FRIENDS.

21:15.525 --> 21:18.358
AND I WAS OKAY
WITH THAT, BUT...

21:19.899 --> 21:21.901
I DON'T THINK
I AM ANYMORE.

21:21.901 --> 21:23.533
DANNY.

21:24.494 --> 21:25.535
( sighs )

21:25.535 --> 21:28.368
YOU-- YOU DON'T FEEL
THE SAME WAY.

21:28.368 --> 21:30.670
- NO, I WANT TO.
I JUST--
- OKAY.

21:31.671 --> 21:33.373
YOU NEED TIME.

21:34.414 --> 21:36.466
JUST SLEEP ON IT, OKAY?

21:36.466 --> 21:38.257
YEAH.

21:42.722 --> 21:44.554
THANK YOU
FOR SAYING THAT.

21:57.897 --> 21:59.899
- ( indistinct chatter )
- ( school bell rings )

21:59.899 --> 22:02.862
- HI.
- HEY.

22:02.862 --> 22:05.945
- I HEARD YOU CAME FORWARD.
- YEAH, I KIND OF HAD TO.

22:05.945 --> 22:09.499
AND DANNY'S OUT
WITH AN ANKLE BRACELET.

22:11.621 --> 22:13.663
IT'S JUST DANNY AND I
THAT CAME FORWARD.

22:13.663 --> 22:15.585
MY DAD DOESN'T THINK THAT
ANYBODY ELSE KNOWS, SO...

22:16.756 --> 22:18.668
I PROBABLY SHOULDN'T
SAY ANYTHING.

22:18.668 --> 22:20.920
BUT DANNY TOLD
THE TRUTH, RIGHT?

22:20.920 --> 22:22.632
WE BOTH DID.

22:22.632 --> 22:24.343
( chuckles softly )

22:25.765 --> 22:28.137
- HAVE YOU SEEN CHARLIE?
- NO.

22:28.137 --> 22:31.310
I JUST-- I DIDN'T SEE HIM
IN GEOMETRY, SO I WAS--

22:31.310 --> 22:32.562
Danny: HEY.

22:32.562 --> 22:34.394
DANNY'S RIGHT, THOUGH--

22:34.394 --> 22:36.476
CHARLIE IS BAD NEWS
AND WE SHOULD ALL STAY
AWAY FROM HIM.

22:36.476 --> 22:38.027
ESPECIALLY YOU.

22:41.320 --> 22:44.323
DANNY, I'M REALLY GLAD
THAT YOU'RE OUT
AND YOU'RE OKAY.

22:45.575 --> 22:47.487
THIS IS ALL
GONNA WORK OUT, RIGHT?

22:47.487 --> 22:50.079
- I HOPE SO.
- YEAH.

22:51.160 --> 22:53.122
WE'RE BACK
ON THE RIGHT TRACKS.

22:56.586 --> 22:58.798
OH, THERE'S WHITNEY. UM...

22:59.799 --> 23:01.921
I'LL SEE YOU GUYS.

23:09.268 --> 23:13.352
( sighs )
THANKS FOR ANOTHER
SLEEPLESS NIGHT.

23:13.352 --> 23:14.434
YEAH, ME TOO.

23:15.815 --> 23:18.317
I JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE
I DON'T SAY TOO MUCH OR--

23:18.317 --> 23:20.109
DID YOU MEAN IT?

23:21.571 --> 23:22.652
EVERY WORD.

23:23.523 --> 23:26.526
I'VE WANTED TO HEAR THAT
FROM YOU FOR...

23:26.526 --> 23:27.737
FOREVER AND...

23:29.408 --> 23:33.372
- THIS IS A REALLY BAD
PLACE TO TALK.
- ( both laugh )

23:33.372 --> 23:35.665
DO YOU WANT
TO MEET UP LATER TONIGHT?

23:35.665 --> 23:37.587
YEAH, OUTSIDE THE LIBRARY...

23:37.587 --> 23:38.838
BY THE STATUE.
LIKE 7:00?

23:38.838 --> 23:41.300
YEAH.
I'LL SEE YOU THERE.

23:58.057 --> 23:59.859
WHITNEY, YOU'VE GOTTA
LET ME DO SOMETHING.

23:59.859 --> 24:02.061
IT'S TOO LATE.
PARENTS ARE SO GOOD

24:02.061 --> 24:04.904
AT MAKING EVERYTHING
A FAIT ACCOMPLI.

24:06.616 --> 24:08.117
ALL DONE, SWEETHEART.

24:08.117 --> 24:09.949
IT'S EASIER EACH GO ROUND.

24:09.949 --> 24:12.121
I KNOW EXACTLY WHERE
TO SIGN, WHERE TO INITIAL,

24:12.121 --> 24:13.623
CAR'S AROUND BACK.

24:17.997 --> 24:21.881
MRS. TAYLOR, I'M SORRY,
BUT I CAN'T KEEP QUIET
ABOUT THIS.

24:21.881 --> 24:24.173
YOUR BOYFRIEND
CAME ONTO WHITNEY...

24:25.505 --> 24:27.176
AND SHE'S SCARED
TO STAY IN YOUR HOUSE.

24:28.798 --> 24:31.090
IT'S AN APARTMENT,
ACTUALLY.

24:31.090 --> 24:34.473
AS FOR GAVIN, I'M WELL AWARE
OF HER WILD ACCUSATIONS.

24:34.473 --> 24:36.055
THAT'S HOW
SHE GOT TO STAY HERE.

24:36.055 --> 24:38.598
THERE'S ALWAYS SOME MOTIVE
BEHIND HER LIES.

24:38.598 --> 24:42.191
JACK, TOO. I WOULDN'T
BE SURPRISED IF THEY COOKED
THAT ONE UP TOGETHER.

24:43.482 --> 24:46.946
BUT... I REALLY--
I DON'T BELIEVE THAT.

24:46.946 --> 24:49.819
OH, YOU HAVEN'T
FIGURED IT OUT YET?
SHE'S A HABITUAL LIAR.

24:49.819 --> 24:52.702
IT'S BEEN A PROBLEM SINCE
SHE WAS OLD ENOUGH TO TALK.
ISN'T THAT RIGHT, WHITNEY?

24:52.702 --> 24:55.034
- WHATEVER YOU SAY, MOM.
- DID SHE TELL YOU THE REASON

24:55.034 --> 24:57.166
THAT WAS SHE KICKED OUT
OF HER LAST BOARDING SCHOOL?

24:57.166 --> 24:59.458
YEAH, SOMETHING TO DO
WITH SKINNY-DIPPING.

24:59.458 --> 25:02.211
- MOM, COME ON.
- AND THAT SHE WAS
WITH ANOTHER STUDENT--

25:02.211 --> 25:03.713
THE SON OF THE DEAN.

25:04.754 --> 25:05.965
- WHAT?
- ( truck approaches )

25:07.426 --> 25:09.298
OH, LOOK WHO'S HERE.

25:09.298 --> 25:10.840
- ( door shuts )
- HEY.

25:12.632 --> 25:14.594
THEY'RE REVIEWING
MY CASE RIGHT NOW
AND IT MIGHT BE DROPPED,

25:14.594 --> 25:17.637
BUT IN THE MEANTIME
I'M OUT ON BAIL AND WHITNEY
STAYS HERE WITH ME.

25:17.637 --> 25:20.189
SHE SETTLED,
SHE HAS FRIENDS.

25:20.189 --> 25:22.021
THERE'S NOTHING
FOR HER IN THE CITY.

25:22.021 --> 25:23.643
YOU KNOW WHAT? FINE.

25:23.643 --> 25:25.565
YOU TWO DESERVE
ONE ANOTHER.
HERE YOU GO.

25:25.565 --> 25:29.358
YOU CAN UNSIGN THEM.
GOOD LUCK WITH EVERYTHING.

25:29.358 --> 25:31.571
LACEY, HAVE FUN
WITH ALL THIS.

25:33.703 --> 25:36.455
- JUST IN TIME, JACK.
- APPARENTLY.

25:36.455 --> 25:39.538
- ( car door closes )
- COME ON, LET'S GET YOU
BACK ENROLLED.

25:39.538 --> 25:42.582
- ( engine starts )
- I'LL CALL YOU LATER, OKAY?

25:50.509 --> 25:53.803
( sighs )
I WAS SO ANGRY AT KYLE FOR
PUTTING JO THROUGH ALL THAT.

25:53.803 --> 25:56.435
WELL, SHE DID IT FOR DANNY.
HER TESTIMONY THAT
IT WAS SELF-DEFENSE

25:56.435 --> 25:58.557
- IS HIS ONLY CHANCE.
- I KNOW.

25:58.557 --> 26:01.140
GOD, LISTEN TO US.
OUR KIDS ARE IN TROUBLE

26:01.140 --> 26:02.812
AND WE'RE LOOKING
FOR SOMEONE TO BLAME.

26:02.812 --> 26:05.855
- IT'S NOT DANNY OR JO.
- OH NO, IT'S VIKRAM
WE SHOULD BLAME.

26:05.855 --> 26:07.276
YEAH, HE LIED
TO ALL OF US,

26:07.276 --> 26:08.648
PAID SOMEONE
TO KILL A YOUNG GIRL,

26:08.648 --> 26:10.690
TRIED TO KILL
OUR CHILDREN...

26:10.690 --> 26:13.242
AND FALSIFIED ADOPTION PAPERS
SO I'D NEVER FIND MY CHILD.

26:13.242 --> 26:14.243
- WHAT?
- OH YEAH.

26:14.243 --> 26:15.785
THOSE PAPERS YOU GAVE ME--

26:15.785 --> 26:17.366
THAT WASN'T MY BABY.

26:17.366 --> 26:21.120
GOD! THE LENGTHS
THAT MAN WENT TO

26:21.120 --> 26:23.162
- TO HURT PEOPLE.
- ( sighs ) WELL,
YOU KNOW WHAT?

26:23.162 --> 26:24.503
LET'S MAKE A PACT RIGHT NOW

26:24.503 --> 26:26.005
THAT WE NEVER MENTION
HIS NAME AGAIN

26:26.005 --> 26:27.627
AND WE JUST WIPE HIM
OUT OF OUR LIVES.

26:27.627 --> 26:29.468
THAT MAY BE THE BEST IDEA
YOU'VE EVER HAD.

26:29.468 --> 26:31.210
YEAH, AND I START HERE--

26:31.210 --> 26:33.883
HIS OFFICE, THAT DESK.

26:33.883 --> 26:35.094
- YOU WANNA HELP?
- WITH WHAT?

26:35.094 --> 26:37.767
SCOURING THIS HOUSE
OF ANYTHING VIKRAM.

26:51.030 --> 26:53.653
( screams )

26:56.946 --> 26:58.327
Karen:
OH, IT'S USELESS.

26:58.327 --> 27:00.449
THEY HAD TO TAKE IT APART
TO BRING IT DOWN HERE.

27:00.449 --> 27:04.203
BUT I THINK
THIS WILL HELP. HERE.

27:04.203 --> 27:06.666
OH. NO, I'LL GIVE YOU
THE HONORS.

27:06.666 --> 27:09.799
- THIS IS YOUR CATHARSIS.
- WELL, I THINK A LITTLE BIT
FOR BOTH OF US.

27:09.799 --> 27:11.711
- WHY DON'T YOU STEP BACK?
- UH-HUH.

27:11.711 --> 27:13.552
OKAY. ( grunts )

27:17.717 --> 27:18.718
( yells )

27:21.100 --> 27:23.562
- ONE MORE TIME!
- ( yells )

27:23.562 --> 27:25.644
OKAY, YOUR TURN.

27:25.644 --> 27:27.316
- YOUR TURN.
- OKAY.

27:33.232 --> 27:35.484
( laughs ) YEAH.

27:35.484 --> 27:36.776
( yells )

27:36.776 --> 27:39.949
OH. THIS FEELS AMAZING.

27:42.742 --> 27:45.334
WAIT WAIT WAIT WAIT.
THERE'S SOMETHING
HIDDEN IN HERE.

27:53.382 --> 27:55.464
LOOKS LIKE MORE SECRETS.

27:58.888 --> 28:00.179
( beeps )

28:02.852 --> 28:04.934
I THOUGHT I TOLD YOU
LIBRARY, SCHOOL, HOME,

28:04.934 --> 28:06.685
- NOWHERE ELSE.
- LOOK, I'M WORRIED ABOUT, JO.

28:06.685 --> 28:09.068
WE WERE SUPPOSED
TO MEET UP AT THE LIBRARY

28:09.068 --> 28:10.940
- AND SHE DIDN'T SHOW UP.
- MEET HER?

28:10.940 --> 28:12.732
- DIDN'T I JUST TELL YOU--
- I KNOW, BUT WE HAD

28:12.732 --> 28:13.983
SOME IMPORTANT THINGS
WE HAD TO TALK ABOUT,

28:13.983 --> 28:15.985
AND SHE WOULDN'T
JUST SKIP IT.

28:15.985 --> 28:18.197
- I'M ASSUMING
YOU CALLED HER.
- I CALLED HER, I TEXTED.

28:18.197 --> 28:21.490
NO RESPONSE.
AND CHARLIE WASN'T
AT SCHOOL TODAY.

28:21.490 --> 28:23.873
- YOU'RE SUPPOSED
TO STAY AWAY FROM HIM, TOO.
- CHIEF, YOU HAVE TO KNOW

28:23.873 --> 28:25.825
- WHERE SOMEONE IS IF YOU WANT
TO STAY AWAY FROM THEM, RIGHT?
- ( chimes )

28:25.825 --> 28:28.087
"AT JOHNNY CAKES
STUDYING WITH RICO."

28:28.087 --> 28:30.379
- THERE YOU GO-- USUAL HAUNT.
- THANKS, CHIEF!

28:30.379 --> 28:32.882
DANNY!
( sighs )

28:35.674 --> 28:38.798
WITH VIKRAM,
THERE'S ALWAYS A MONEY TRAIL.

28:38.798 --> 28:41.600
- IS THERE A MIDDLE INITIAL?
- YEAH, "M."

28:41.600 --> 28:43.432
DR. ROBERT M. PRINZ.

28:44.553 --> 28:46.395
YOU KNOW, IT COULD BE
A CHECK FOR ANYTHING.

28:47.686 --> 28:49.478
DATED TWO DAYS
AFTER YOU GAVE BIRTH?

28:51.560 --> 28:54.944
- ( beeps )
- I GOT HIM. ( sighs )

28:54.944 --> 28:57.817
AND IT'S... EVERTON--

28:57.817 --> 29:00.529
A LITTLE TOWN NEAR THE FARM
WHERE I HAD THE BABY.

29:00.529 --> 29:03.032
A COUNTRY DOCTOR,
AND HE HAS A CLINIC.

29:03.032 --> 29:04.994
A HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS
TO DELIVER A BABY?

29:04.994 --> 29:06.916
IT'S AWFULLY STEEP.

29:08.627 --> 29:11.080
UNLESS AN ILLEGAL ADOPTION
WAS PART OF THE PACKAGE.

29:11.080 --> 29:13.082
( doorbell chimes )

29:20.299 --> 29:22.972
- JACK.
- HI, KAREN.

29:22.972 --> 29:25.845
- YOU'RE OUT.
- BAIL.

29:25.845 --> 29:28.888
AFTER DANNY'S CONFESSION,
IT'S ALL UP IN THE AIR NOW.

29:28.888 --> 29:31.560
HELLO, JACK.
I'M SURE YOU GUYS HAVE
A LOT TO CATCH UP ON.

29:34.483 --> 29:35.524
COME ON IN.

29:37.606 --> 29:39.528
I'M ACTUALLY SURPRISED
YOU'RE HERE.

29:41.901 --> 29:43.993
A LITTLE
SURPRISED MYSELF.

29:43.993 --> 29:47.166
I'M SORRY
FOR WHAT I SAID
WHEN I VISITED YOU.

29:52.751 --> 29:55.044
I'M NOT GONNA LIE.
I STRUGGLED IN THERE, KAREN.

29:56.175 --> 29:58.217
BUT AS UPSET AS I WAS,

29:58.217 --> 30:01.630
HOW CAN
I ARGUE WITH A MOTHER
PROTECTING HER SON?

30:03.472 --> 30:05.474
I NEVER TRIED
TO KILL VIKRAM.

30:07.726 --> 30:09.518
FUNNY THING IS,

30:09.518 --> 30:10.930
YOU WERE RIGHT.

30:10.930 --> 30:12.311
I MOVED THE BODY.

30:12.311 --> 30:14.483
I STAGED THE ACCIDENT.

30:14.483 --> 30:17.396
JUST DIDN'T PLAN
ON THEM FINDING MY D.N.A.

30:17.396 --> 30:19.568
HOW DID YOU--

30:19.568 --> 30:21.400
YOU ASKED ME
TO FIND VIKRAM.

30:21.400 --> 30:22.862
I DID.

30:23.993 --> 30:25.744
AND BEFORE YOU EVEN ASK,

30:25.744 --> 30:27.826
I DID NOT KNOW
ABOUT THE $10 MILLION.

30:27.826 --> 30:29.248
I WAS PROTECTING DANNY.

30:30.249 --> 30:31.911
I WAS PROTECTING YOU.

30:33.832 --> 30:35.834
JACK, I AM SO SORRY.

30:35.834 --> 30:38.837
I NEVER
SHOULD'VE DOUBTED YOU.

30:41.961 --> 30:43.883
COULD YOU EVER FORGIVE ME?

30:45.764 --> 30:47.806
HERE WE ARE AGAIN, RIGHT?

30:47.806 --> 30:50.639
ME NOT BEING ABLE
TO SAY NO TO YOU.

31:05.284 --> 31:07.286
WHY WON'T YOU
ANSWER MY CALLS?

31:09.198 --> 31:10.619
YOU REALLY HAVE TO ASK?

31:10.619 --> 31:13.792
OKAY, SO I LIED
ABOUT BOARDING SCHOOL.

31:13.792 --> 31:16.375
AND YOU TOLD ME
YOU'D ONLY BEEN WITH GIRLS.

31:16.375 --> 31:18.417
I NEEDED A WEEKEND PASS
TO GET INTO THE CITY.

31:18.417 --> 31:21.000
HIS DAD WAS THE DEAN.
IT'S NOT LIKE--
( inhales )

31:21.000 --> 31:22.841
IT WASN'T A RELATIONSHIP.

31:22.841 --> 31:25.674
I'M SORRY.
I'M JUST A LITTLE SENSITIVE
TO LIES RIGHT NOW.

31:25.674 --> 31:28.847
I KNOW, AND I SHOULD'VE
REALIZED THAT AND JUST
TOLD YOU, BUT, LACE,

31:28.847 --> 31:31.680
I'VE RISKED A LOT
BY BEING WITH YOU, TOO.

31:31.680 --> 31:33.012
RISKED WHAT?

31:34.603 --> 31:36.475
- WHAT'D YOU RISK?
- NO, I MEAN...

31:36.475 --> 31:38.647
( sighs )

31:38.647 --> 31:41.190
I HAVEN'T HAD
A LOT OF CLOSE FRIENDS.

31:41.190 --> 31:43.282
- ( sighs )
- AND...

31:44.613 --> 31:46.825
MAYBE I AM
LIKE MY MOM IN THAT WAY.

31:48.697 --> 31:51.410
I JUST USE PEOPLE
TO GET WHAT I WANT.

31:52.741 --> 31:53.993
GUYS AND GIRLS.

31:53.993 --> 31:55.794
YOU REALLY THINK THAT
YOU CAN JUST SAY ALL THIS

31:55.794 --> 31:57.296
AND THEN, WHAT,
WE'LL BE BESTIES,

31:57.296 --> 31:59.378
- AND LIVE HAPPILY EVER AFTER?
- ( sighs )

31:59.378 --> 32:00.960
NO.

32:00.960 --> 32:02.881
I DIDN'T THINK THAT.

32:04.753 --> 32:06.545
I'M SORRY.
I JUST CAN'T RIGHT NOW.

32:09.508 --> 32:11.050
OKAY THEN.

32:12.311 --> 32:14.183
JUST SO YOU KNOW,
I'M SORRY, TOO.

32:21.900 --> 32:23.612
YOU OKAY?

32:25.484 --> 32:27.616
I KINDA OVERHEARD.

32:29.528 --> 32:31.370
I DON'T KNOW.
( sighs )

32:32.701 --> 32:34.783
WHAT'S THE MATTER?

32:34.783 --> 32:36.835
( sighs, chuckles )

32:36.835 --> 32:37.916
IT'S KIND OF A MESS.

32:37.916 --> 32:39.788
HEY, RICO.

32:39.788 --> 32:42.541
WHERE'S-- WHERE'S JO?
IS SHE IN THE RESTROOM?

32:42.541 --> 32:44.923
UH, I-- I DOUBT IT,

32:44.923 --> 32:47.046
UNLESS SHE SNUCK PAST ME.
SHE HASN'T BEEN
HERE ALL NIGHT.

32:47.046 --> 32:49.548
I HAVEN'T
SEEN HER SINCE SCHOOL.
IS EVERYTHING OKAY?

32:49.548 --> 32:51.890
I'M NOT SURE.
SHE TEXTED HER DAD SAYING
SHE WAS GONNA BE HERE

32:51.890 --> 32:53.802
AND SHE WON'T ANSWER
ANY OF MY CALLS, SO...

32:54.893 --> 32:56.595
DANNY, AREN'T YOU
SUPPOSED TO BE, LIKE,

32:56.595 --> 32:58.767
HOME, THEN SCHOOL
AND NOTHING IN BETWEEN?

32:58.767 --> 33:00.769
YEAH. OKAY,
I'M JUST WORRIED THAT--

33:00.769 --> 33:02.901
YOU KNOW WHAT?
NEVER MIND.

33:02.901 --> 33:04.313
YOU'RE JUST GONNA SAY
I'M BEING PARANOID AGAIN.

33:04.313 --> 33:05.904
WELL, NOT IF YOU'RE RIGHT,
THEN IT'S GOOD THINKING,

33:05.904 --> 33:08.317
NOT PARANOIA.
JO TOLD ME WHAT HAPPENED.

33:08.317 --> 33:10.109
- ( sighs )
- GREAT, LACEY,

33:10.109 --> 33:11.950
CAN YOU ACTUALLY
TEXT HER ON HER PHONE?

33:11.950 --> 33:14.953
"TRACK A FRIEND"
IS BETTER.

33:19.708 --> 33:21.710
( beeping )

33:24.833 --> 33:26.885
- OKAY, I GOT HER.
- ( beeps )

33:28.257 --> 33:29.838
CHIEF-- ( sighs )

33:29.838 --> 33:31.720
CHIEF MASTERSON,
THIS IS DANNY.

33:31.720 --> 33:34.513
I FOUND JO.
SHE'S IN WILLOUGHBY.

33:34.513 --> 33:35.844
( buzzes )

33:40.349 --> 33:41.940
( moans )

33:41.940 --> 33:44.353
( gasps )

33:49.648 --> 33:51.530
I'M HOLDING IT FOR YOU.

33:54.243 --> 33:57.156
YOU'RE PROBABLY THIRSTY.
I GOT--

33:57.156 --> 33:59.918
DON'T-- DON'T COME
NEAR ME, CHARLIE.

33:59.918 --> 34:01.660
I'M NOT GONNA HURT YOU, JO.

34:02.871 --> 34:05.964
LOOK, I JUST--
I BROUGHT YOU HERE SO-- SO--

34:05.964 --> 34:08.967
SO WE COULD TALK
AND I COULD FIGURE OUT
WHAT TO DO NEXT.

34:08.967 --> 34:10.469
THIS IS WRONG, CHARLIE.

34:10.469 --> 34:12.591
THIS IS--
THIS IS REALLY WRONG.

34:12.591 --> 34:14.303
YEAH, NO, I-- I KNOW,

34:14.303 --> 34:16.765
AND IF I COULD'VE
FIGURED OUT ANOTHER WAY--

34:16.765 --> 34:18.137
WE'RE NOT
IN GREEN GROVE, ARE WE?

34:21.440 --> 34:22.941
NO.

34:24.443 --> 34:26.445
THIS IS WHERE
I LIVED BEFORE...

34:27.646 --> 34:29.148
BEFORE MY MOTHER
WAS MURDERED

34:29.148 --> 34:30.569
BY VIKRAM DESAI.

34:32.281 --> 34:33.782
YOUR MOM?

34:33.782 --> 34:35.904
( grunts ) YEAH.

34:37.826 --> 34:39.908
MY MOM WAS...

34:41.290 --> 34:43.872
MY MOM WAS
DANNY'S AUNT TARA.

34:49.708 --> 34:51.089
HOW IS THAT POSSIBLE?

34:51.089 --> 34:53.972
"STAY AWAY
FROM GREEN GROVE," SHE SAID.

34:53.972 --> 34:57.055
YOU KNOW, "STAY AWAY
FROM VIKRAM DESAI."

34:57.055 --> 34:59.638
- ( chuckles )
- WHY?

34:59.638 --> 35:01.019
I DON'T KNOW WHY.

35:01.019 --> 35:04.813
I MEAN, NO ONE--
NO ONE TOLD ME ANYTHING.

35:04.813 --> 35:07.146
I MEAN, YOU HAVE TO
UNDERSTAND. I--

35:07.146 --> 35:09.398
I GREW UP IN THIS--
THIS-- THIS CLOUD.

35:09.398 --> 35:12.731
IT WASN'T LIKE OTHER KIDS
WHO HAD FAMILIES,

35:12.731 --> 35:15.073
THEY HAD SIBLINGS--
NORMAL THINGS.

35:15.073 --> 35:17.236
- AND THEN TARA WAS MURDERED.
- YEAH.

35:18.577 --> 35:20.369
I WAS 13 AND NO ONE--

35:20.369 --> 35:21.950
NO ONE REALLY SAID
ANYTHING TO ME.

35:21.950 --> 35:24.042
THEY JUST--
THEY PUT ME IN FOSTER CARE.

35:24.042 --> 35:26.955
BUT ALL I COULD
THINK ABOUT WAS--

35:26.955 --> 35:28.877
WAS HOW
MY MOTHER HAD DIED,

35:28.877 --> 35:30.749
WHO KILLED HER.

35:30.749 --> 35:32.090
IT WASN'T AN ACCIDENT

35:32.090 --> 35:34.343
THAT YOU ENDED UP
IN JUVIE WITH DANNY.

35:34.343 --> 35:36.094
NO.

35:36.094 --> 35:37.716
NO, IT WASN'T
AN ACCIDENT.

35:37.716 --> 35:39.258
I STOLE A CAR

35:39.258 --> 35:41.890
SO THAT I WOULD BE PUT
IN THE SAME FACILITY AS HIM.

35:41.890 --> 35:43.222
I MEAN... ( laughs )

35:43.222 --> 35:45.103
IT TOOK MONTHS TO FIGURE OUT

35:45.103 --> 35:47.606
HOW TO WORK MY WAY
INTO BEING HIS ROOMMATE.

35:47.606 --> 35:49.688
TO KILL HIM.

35:49.688 --> 35:52.030
- YOU WANTED
TO KILL HIM FOR REVENGE.
- NO.

35:52.030 --> 35:53.572
- UNDERSTAND--
THAT'S NOT WHAT I SAID.
- YES, YOU DID.

35:53.572 --> 35:55.113
YOU WANTED TO KILL HIM
FOR KILLING YOUR MOM!

35:55.113 --> 35:57.115
- ADMIT IT, CHARLIE!
- OKAY, FINE! YES!

35:57.115 --> 35:58.737
I WANTED HIM DEAD!

35:58.737 --> 36:01.910
BUT THEN I FIND OUT
THAT HE DIDN'T KILL MY MOM,

36:01.910 --> 36:04.042
THAT VIKRAM KILLED HER!

36:04.042 --> 36:05.544
AND THEN WHAT HAPPENS,
YOU KNOW?

36:05.544 --> 36:07.666
DANNY AND I, WE-- WE--
( crying )

36:07.666 --> 36:08.747
WE BECOME CLOSE,

36:08.747 --> 36:12.211
AND ALL HE TALKS ABOUT
INSIDE IS--

36:12.211 --> 36:15.964
IS YOU, LACEY,
AND GREEN GROVE.

36:15.964 --> 36:17.466
EVERYTHING
THAT HE WAS MISSING

36:17.466 --> 36:20.058
- WAS WHAT I NEVER HAD.
- SO YOU JUST DECIDED

36:20.058 --> 36:21.640
TO COME HERE
AND TAKE IT FROM HIM.

36:21.640 --> 36:22.761
NO, THERE'S--

36:22.761 --> 36:24.353
NO, I JUST WANTED
A FRESH START.

36:24.353 --> 36:27.356
LIKE I TOLD DANNY,
LIKE I TOLD EVERYBODY.

36:29.067 --> 36:32.611
THAT NIGHT IN THE WOODS,
YOU SAW... EVERYTHING.

36:33.772 --> 36:34.983
WHY DIDN'T YOU TELL US?

36:34.983 --> 36:36.154
I DIDN'T--
I DIDN'T WANT--

36:36.154 --> 36:38.156
YOU THOUGHT THAT
YOU COULD USE IT SOMEHOW.

36:38.156 --> 36:40.198
NO. NO, I JUST--

36:40.198 --> 36:42.621
I FOLLOWED YOUR LEAD
AND I DIDN'T SAY ANYTHING.

36:43.992 --> 36:46.665
AND THEN HE--

36:46.665 --> 36:47.826
AND THEN WHAT?

36:50.088 --> 36:52.040
AND THEN I FELL
IN LOVE WITH YOU, JO.

36:53.922 --> 36:57.296
MAYBE BACK IN JUVIE,
BUT DEFINITELY WHEN
I GOT TO GREEN GROVE

36:57.296 --> 37:02.140
AND I SAW THIS SAD GIRL
JUST DEALING WITH SO MUCH.

37:02.140 --> 37:04.012
JUST LIKE ME.

37:15.614 --> 37:16.945
CHARLIE.

37:20.359 --> 37:23.071
CHARLIE, IF YOU LOVE ME,
YOU'LL LET ME GO, RIGHT?

37:24.783 --> 37:26.535
YOU'D NEVER HURT ME.

37:32.080 --> 37:34.002
( breathing heavily )

37:36.084 --> 37:38.086
( screaming )

37:43.382 --> 37:46.305
- Tess: DR. PRINZ.
- YES?

37:48.307 --> 37:50.519
YOU DELIVERED
A BABY 18 YEARS AGO...

37:51.690 --> 37:53.482
AND WERE PAID VAST SUM
TO MAKE SURE THAT CHILD

37:53.482 --> 37:55.233
ENDED UP
IN A CERTAIN FAMILY'S ARMS.

37:55.233 --> 37:57.235
( sighs )

37:57.235 --> 38:00.028
I KNEW YOU'D COME
EVENTUALLY.

38:02.160 --> 38:04.953
( sighs )
I SUPPOSE IT DOESN'T MATTER

38:04.953 --> 38:07.165
THAT WAS
THE ONLY UNETHICAL THING
I'VE DONE IN MY LIFE.

38:08.907 --> 38:11.330
I BUILT THIS CLINIC
WITH THAT HUNDRED THOUSAND.

38:14.963 --> 38:16.965
I'M NOT GOING
TO THE AUTHORITIES, DOCTOR.

38:19.087 --> 38:21.550
I JUST WANNA FIND MY BABY.

38:21.550 --> 38:24.763
( sighs )

38:25.924 --> 38:27.926
THERE WAS A REASON

38:27.926 --> 38:31.189
VIKRAM WENT TO SUCH LENGTHS
TO KEEP THAT KNOWLEDGE FROM YOU.

38:35.394 --> 38:38.236
LOOK, I REALLY APPRECIATE
YOU DOING THIS,

38:38.236 --> 38:40.819
ESPECIALLY AFTER ALL
THAT HAPPENED BETWEEN US.

38:43.902 --> 38:45.904
I-- I'M WORRIED FOR JO, TOO.

38:47.946 --> 38:50.248
AND NO MATTER
HOW ANGRY I GET AT YOU

38:50.248 --> 38:52.831
AND AT JO...
( scoffs )

38:52.831 --> 38:54.543
IT ALWAYS COMES BACK
TO THE FRIENDSHIP.

38:58.957 --> 39:00.959
( cellphone buzzing )

39:04.593 --> 39:06.134
- ( beeps )
- HELLO.

39:06.134 --> 39:07.516
I GOT YOUR MESSAGE.
I'M ON MY WAY.

39:07.516 --> 39:09.267
I also got a report
your ankle bracelet went off.

39:09.267 --> 39:12.391
WHERE ARE YOU?
DANNY? CAN YOU HEAR ME?

39:12.391 --> 39:14.102
- Danny?
- LOSING YOU, CHIEF.

39:14.102 --> 39:16.024
( beeps )

39:16.024 --> 39:17.686
Woman's voice:
Call ended.

39:17.686 --> 39:19.107
HE WANTS US
TO TURN AROUND,
DOESN'T HE?

39:19.107 --> 39:21.610
HE WANTS ME TO.
HE DIDN'T SAY ANYTHING
ABOUT YOU.

39:31.750 --> 39:33.912
( door opens )

39:37.255 --> 39:38.997
( door closes )

39:51.680 --> 39:53.271
NICE HOUSE, HUH?

39:53.271 --> 39:54.683
TO DIE FOR.

39:55.974 --> 39:58.977
- THINK YOU'RE GONNA
LIKE IT HERE.
- YEAH.

40:01.940 --> 40:03.612
HOW ARE THINGS WITH LACEY?

40:04.943 --> 40:07.365
SHE SAID I'M A LIAR
AND MANIPULATOR.

40:09.077 --> 40:12.080
- SMART GIRL.
- HOW ABOUT CHARLIE?

40:12.080 --> 40:12.991
HE WENT ROGUE.

40:14.162 --> 40:16.204
NEVER WAS COMFORTABLE
WORKING WITH HIM.

40:16.204 --> 40:18.246
BUT DON'T WORRY.

40:18.246 --> 40:21.089
PRETTY MUCH,
IT'S ALL WORKED PERFECTLY

40:21.089 --> 40:23.001
WE'RE IN
WITH THE DESAIS NOW.

40:23.001 --> 40:25.464
THAT'S ALL THAT MATTERS.

40:29.097 --> 40:32.681
( grunts )
I NEED YOU
TO STOP THIS, JO, OKAY?

40:32.681 --> 40:35.053
YOU JUST REALLY
HAVE TO LISTEN TO WHAT
I'M SAYING, ALL RIGHT?

40:35.053 --> 40:36.434
I NEED YOU
TO UNDERSTAND.

40:39.437 --> 40:41.059
CHARLIE, THAT'S TOO TIGHT.

40:41.059 --> 40:42.901
( creaks )

40:46.945 --> 40:48.567
- CHARLIE.
- STAY BACK, DANNY.

40:50.989 --> 40:54.282
LET HER GO, CHARLIE.
I'M THE ONE YOU WANT.

40:54.282 --> 40:56.955
- NOT HER.
- DANNY, YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND.

40:57.956 --> 40:58.917
YOUR AUNT TARA
WAS HIS MOM.

41:15.644 --> 41:16.725
( parking brake clicks )

41:29.528 --> 41:31.530
I SHOULDN'T HAVE TOLD YOU.
I SHOULD'VE KEPT IT SECRET.

41:31.530 --> 41:34.372
- I JUST--
- IT'S OKAY. WE WERE
ALL KEEPING SECRETS.

41:34.372 --> 41:38.036
LOOK AT ME. CHARLIE,
YOU DON'T WANNA HURT JO.

41:38.036 --> 41:40.378
YOU WANT
TO LET HER GO, OKAY?

41:40.378 --> 41:42.000
- GIVE ME THE KNIFE.
JUST GIVE ME THE KNIFE.
- ( gun cocks )

41:43.792 --> 41:45.173
NICE AND SLOW, CHARLIE,

41:45.173 --> 41:46.675
- DROP THE KNIFE
AND LET HER GO.
- EASY, CHIEF.

41:46.675 --> 41:48.256
HE'S NOT GONNA HURT HER,
RIGHT, CHARLIE?

41:48.256 --> 41:50.549
- YOU'RE NOT GONNA HURT HER.
- DANNY, GET OUT OF THE WAY.

41:54.342 --> 41:58.096
CHARLIE, STOP.
PLEASE.

41:59.097 --> 42:01.730
KYLE, YOU CAN'T
HURT CHARLIE.

42:01.730 --> 42:04.022
HE'S MY SON.
