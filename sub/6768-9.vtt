00:09.300 --> 00:12.804
Excuse me, I'm looking
for a friend of mine.

00:12.887 --> 00:14.264
Anyone I know?

00:14.347 --> 00:15.932
Yeah, she's a waitress here.

00:16.015 --> 00:17.225
Really friendly.

00:17.308 --> 00:18.977
{\an1}We used to spend a lot
of time together.

00:19.060 --> 00:20.854
But we don't anymore.

00:20.937 --> 00:22.564
Look, I thought
I'd give you some room.

00:22.647 --> 00:23.940
Let you figure things out.

00:24.023 --> 00:25.775
There's nothing to figure out.

00:25.859 --> 00:27.026
It's not my baby.

00:27.110 --> 00:29.446
Then why not get tested?

00:29.529 --> 00:31.990
Carly, we've been over this.
I don't need to spend

00:32.073 --> 00:33.825
a thousand dollars
to find out what I already know.

00:33.908 --> 00:35.326
The problem is,

00:35.410 --> 00:38.163
{\an3}until you do, it's
Jodi's word against yours.

00:38.246 --> 00:39.456
You believe her?

00:39.539 --> 00:40.957
I want to believe you.

00:41.040 --> 00:42.792
{\an3}But if you're
careless enough

00:42.876 --> 00:44.961
to have sex with someone
you hardly know

00:45.044 --> 00:46.254
{\an3}then how careful
could you have been

00:46.337 --> 00:47.756
about birth control?

00:47.839 --> 00:48.965
Very careful.

00:49.048 --> 00:50.633
I know you're scared.

00:50.717 --> 00:52.969
There's nothing
to be scared about.

00:53.052 --> 00:55.513
But the DNA test is the only
way to put this behind you.

00:55.597 --> 00:59.017
So, I'm guilty
until proven innocent,

00:59.100 --> 01:01.102
{\an4}is that it?
In this case,
yes, you are.

01:06.107 --> 01:09.027

<i>So, you'll be looking</i>
<i>for Erica again tonight?</i>

01:09.110 --> 01:10.862
Right.

01:10.945 --> 01:12.947
All right, well, you've
got my number, Detective.

01:13.031 --> 01:14.240
Thanks.

01:14.324 --> 01:15.825
We're covered for tonight.

01:15.909 --> 01:18.661
{\an1}That's what he said last
night and the night before.

01:18.745 --> 01:20.497
{\an3}Don't worry, I'll get
on missing persons.

01:20.580 --> 01:22.791
{\an1}All right, I'm gonna be
in the outreach vans.

01:22.874 --> 01:24.375
Donna will be with me.

01:24.459 --> 01:26.211
You know, if Valerie had
just done what she was

01:26.294 --> 01:27.629
supposed to do, none of
this would've happened.

01:27.712 --> 01:28.838
{\an3}It's not like she meant
for this to happen.

01:28.922 --> 01:31.007
She lost a $20,000 necklace.

01:31.090 --> 01:32.967
{\an1}You know what, I don't want
to talk about Valerie.

01:33.051 --> 01:35.678
{\an3}Okay, look, if Detective
Pate calls, I'll find you.

01:35.762 --> 01:36.721
If he calls.

01:36.805 --> 01:38.139
She'll turn up, Kel.

01:40.600 --> 01:42.644
{\an3}Bye.

Yeah, to the nearest

Thousands of teenage

You know the drill.

04:17.673 --> 04:19.509

04:44.617 --> 04:46.202
{\an1}Hey.

04:46.286 --> 04:47.912
Hey, thanks for coming.

04:49.455 --> 04:51.374
You said it was important.

04:51.457 --> 04:53.668
After we hung up I gave
Jackie six-five and even

04:53.751 --> 04:56.212
that it was either graduate
school or an engagement.

04:56.295 --> 04:57.547
Was I right?

04:57.630 --> 05:00.133
Not exactly.

05:03.136 --> 05:04.303
I'm broke.

05:07.974 --> 05:09.851
{\an3}How bad?
Well...

05:09.934 --> 05:12.228
all my credit cards
are maxed out, um...

05:12.311 --> 05:14.230
I'm in debt to six
different vendors.

05:14.313 --> 05:16.107
The bank won't loan me a nickel.

05:16.190 --> 05:18.192
{\an3}And I paid my
last month's rent

05:18.276 --> 05:20.361
by forging one
of Donna's checks.

05:21.821 --> 05:22.905
I can't believe this.

05:22.989 --> 05:24.073
How could you

05:24.157 --> 05:25.241
let this happen?

05:25.324 --> 05:26.409
{\an3}I'm not worried
about the creditors.

05:26.492 --> 05:28.036
Okay? I can handle them.

05:28.119 --> 05:29.579
It's the money that
I took from Donna.

05:29.662 --> 05:31.748
And how much was that?

05:31.831 --> 05:33.416
2,500.

05:36.335 --> 05:39.255
All right, here's what you do.
You declare bankruptcy.

05:39.338 --> 05:40.840
Dad...
Listen to me.

05:42.008 --> 05:43.092
I have a great attorney.

05:43.176 --> 05:44.969
{\an1}He'll fix it so that
you can stay in business

05:45.053 --> 05:47.263
and keep the vendors away.

05:47.346 --> 05:48.222
What about everybody else?

05:48.306 --> 05:50.725
What everybody?

05:50.808 --> 05:52.060
It's just Donna, right?

05:52.143 --> 05:53.561
Yeah.

05:53.644 --> 05:54.312
Are you sure?

05:54.395 --> 05:55.855
Yes.

05:57.440 --> 06:00.109
All right, as soon as I
get back to the office,

06:00.193 --> 06:02.612
I'll have the attorney's number
and a check for the money

06:02.695 --> 06:04.489
that you owe Donna messengered

06:04.572 --> 06:05.490

06:18.086 --> 06:19.128
Yeah...

06:20.088 --> 06:21.130
{\an3}Hi.

06:24.092 --> 06:25.093
Thanks for meeting me here.

06:25.176 --> 06:27.470
Well, I'm happy you called.

06:27.553 --> 06:30.139
{\an3}After a day went by,
I wasn't sure you would.

06:30.223 --> 06:32.809
{\an1}Well, to be honest, I...
I needed some time to think.

06:32.892 --> 06:35.103
Believe me, I understand.

06:35.186 --> 06:36.229
{\an3}After I found out
I was pregnant,

06:36.312 --> 06:39.774
{\an3}it was at least a week before
I told anybody about it.

06:39.857 --> 06:41.818
Have a seat, please.

06:41.901 --> 06:42.944
{\an3}Thank you.

06:44.904 --> 06:46.489
(sighs)

06:46.572 --> 06:49.826
{\an1}You know, Jodi, I've been
giving it a lot of thought.

06:49.909 --> 06:51.619
I've gone back
over the summer

06:51.702 --> 06:55.706
{\an1}and the weekend
we spent together.

06:55.790 --> 06:57.458
I know we used protection.

06:57.542 --> 06:59.043
So do I.

06:59.127 --> 07:01.671
I mean, that's what makes
this so hard to believe, but...

07:01.754 --> 07:03.131
Well, I know it's yours.

07:03.214 --> 07:04.799
How can you be sure?

07:04.882 --> 07:08.803
Well, because since I broke up
with my boyfriend last December

07:08.886 --> 07:10.221
you're the only guy that I

07:10.304 --> 07:11.222
{\an3}slept with.

07:11.305 --> 07:13.224
I'm not ready to be a dad.

07:14.267 --> 07:15.518
I understand that.

07:15.601 --> 07:16.310
Do you?

07:16.394 --> 07:18.020
{\an1}Because it means
you'll probably be

07:18.104 --> 07:20.189
raising this kid
all by yourself.

07:20.273 --> 07:21.732
I've seen the life
of a single parent

07:21.816 --> 07:23.151
up close, and it's murder.

07:23.234 --> 07:25.027
Well, I'm willing to
do whatever it takes.

07:25.111 --> 07:27.029
Not getting the man you want?

07:27.113 --> 07:29.365
{\an1}Not getting the
job you want?

07:29.448 --> 07:31.033
You're willing to
sacrifice all that?

07:31.117 --> 07:32.034
Yeah, I would.

07:32.118 --> 07:33.077
Why?

07:33.161 --> 07:34.829
Because I'd love my child.

07:34.912 --> 07:35.830
Well, if you really

07:35.913 --> 07:37.039
loved this child,

07:37.123 --> 07:38.207
you wouldn't bring him
into the world

07:38.291 --> 07:40.042
{\an1}like this.
(sighing)

07:40.126 --> 07:41.335
I'm not getting an abortion.

07:41.419 --> 07:43.254
Then give the kid what he needs.

07:43.337 --> 07:45.214
{\an1}A family.

07:45.298 --> 07:46.549
A mother and a father

07:46.632 --> 07:49.218
who can love him
and take care of him.

07:49.302 --> 07:50.344
Give him up for adoption.

07:50.428 --> 07:51.888
Never.

07:51.971 --> 07:53.764
You know, I was adopted.

07:53.848 --> 07:55.349
And I'm grateful

07:55.433 --> 07:56.767
for what my birth mother did.

07:56.851 --> 07:58.561
Well, I said never.

07:58.644 --> 08:00.771
Jodi, please,
just think about it.

08:00.855 --> 08:02.023
I already have.

08:02.106 --> 08:04.108
And I've made up my mind.

08:04.192 --> 08:05.651
I'm having our baby.

08:18.706 --> 08:21.042
How'd you get in here?

08:21.125 --> 08:23.002
{\an3}Easy.

08:23.085 --> 08:25.379
{\an3}I told the harbormaster
that I was your girlfriend.

08:25.463 --> 08:26.589
Which you're not.

08:26.672 --> 08:29.217
Maybe.

08:29.300 --> 08:30.426
The night's still young.

08:32.178 --> 08:33.261
You shouldn't have done this.

08:33.346 --> 08:37.225
{\an3}I know, that's
kind of why I did.

08:40.852 --> 08:41.938
I think you should go.

08:44.023 --> 08:45.942
{\an3}Noah...

08:46.025 --> 08:47.235
We belong together.

08:47.318 --> 08:48.903
Yeah, for richer
or for poorer, right?

08:48.986 --> 08:50.112
I believe that.

08:50.196 --> 08:51.322
(scoffs)

08:51.405 --> 08:52.823
You got a funny way
of showing it.

08:55.534 --> 08:57.954
Come on, I'll walk you
to your car.

08:59.538 --> 09:00.790
Look, people make mistakes.

09:00.873 --> 09:02.792
Even you, everybody does.

09:02.875 --> 09:04.126
Yeah, I've made many.

09:04.210 --> 09:05.795
{\an1}Enough to know which
ones are unforgivable.

09:05.878 --> 09:07.129
Why can't you just let it go?

09:07.213 --> 09:08.631
No.

09:08.714 --> 09:10.925
Look, I'm trying
not to lose it here.

09:16.597 --> 09:19.100
Yeah, I know.

09:19.183 --> 09:20.351
Come on.

09:21.727 --> 09:23.104
Come on, let's go.

09:40.079 --> 09:41.664
{\an1}Hey, hey, where'd
they find her?

09:41.747 --> 09:43.541
{\an3}In a sweep at Sunset
and Orange Grove.

09:43.624 --> 09:44.834
Is she all right? Is she hurt?

09:44.917 --> 09:45.960
She's not hurt.

09:49.588 --> 09:52.383
Regulations say that
a minor can only be released

09:52.466 --> 09:54.427
into the custody
of a legal guardian.

09:54.510 --> 09:56.095
But when there is
no legal guardian,

09:56.178 --> 09:58.014
your department has agreed
to release teen prostitutes

09:58.097 --> 09:59.265
into the custody of the

09:59.348 --> 10:00.349
Wyatt Foundation, right?

10:00.433 --> 10:01.851
And you're here
as a representative

10:01.934 --> 10:02.852
of the foundation?

10:02.935 --> 10:03.853
Yeah.

10:03.936 --> 10:05.855
{\an1}She's also a friend
of the family.

10:05.938 --> 10:07.815
What she is
is a kid who's in trouble.

10:07.898 --> 10:09.525
That's why we're here.

10:17.616 --> 10:19.535
All right, Erica, we'll
get you out of here, okay?

10:19.618 --> 10:20.911
I'm all choked up.

10:25.291 --> 10:28.044
I'm, uh, guessing here, but...
these things

10:28.127 --> 10:30.880
{\an3}don't look like they just
leaped out of your hope chest.

10:30.963 --> 10:33.007
Any of these things yours?

10:33.090 --> 10:34.675
{\an1}And if so, do you
want to press charges?

10:34.759 --> 10:35.718
Yeah, the bracelet's mine.

10:38.512 --> 10:39.722
But I gave it to her.

10:41.140 --> 10:42.141
Merry Christmas.

11:02.370 --> 11:04.163
(garbled dispatch transmission)

11:08.668 --> 11:09.627
Later, Julie.

11:09.710 --> 11:11.170
Yeah.

11:13.673 --> 11:15.091
Is there anything
else, Detective?

11:15.174 --> 11:16.759
Nope.

11:16.842 --> 11:18.552
I've seen all I can stomach.

11:32.692 --> 11:34.819
You should have called first.

11:36.862 --> 11:40.658
{\an1}Um, I didn't think
you'd see me if I did.

11:42.827 --> 11:45.454
{\an1}I-I just... I-I
need five minutes.

11:46.872 --> 11:48.040
Sure.

11:50.543 --> 11:51.919
(sighs)

11:54.839 --> 11:59.802
I'd like to start
by apologizing

11:59.885 --> 12:00.928
for everything I did.

12:01.011 --> 12:03.556
Um, I was in way over my head

12:03.639 --> 12:06.851
and instead of reaching
out for help, um...

12:08.394 --> 12:10.104
I covered up.

12:11.730 --> 12:14.108
Oh, um...

12:16.068 --> 12:17.987
Here.

12:18.070 --> 12:20.656
It's a check.

12:20.739 --> 12:22.658
It covers everything I took.

12:28.038 --> 12:31.959
I'll take the money.

12:32.042 --> 12:33.252
Not the apology.

12:34.253 --> 12:36.797
Donna, I know what
I did was wrong.

12:36.881 --> 12:38.132
No, you don't.

12:39.758 --> 12:42.553
Not if you think you can hand
me a check and be forgiven.

12:47.725 --> 12:49.685
I just can't trust you anymore.

12:49.768 --> 12:52.021
I'm asking for
another chance here.

12:52.104 --> 12:53.647
And I can't give you one.

12:56.734 --> 12:58.486
Not now.

13:00.488 --> 13:02.573
Maybe someday.

13:05.784 --> 13:08.078
But for now I think
we need to be apart.

13:09.663 --> 13:11.373
Donna, please.

13:12.500 --> 13:14.919
I want your things
out of the apartment.

13:18.589 --> 13:21.300
I'll stay away tomorrow
so you can move your stuff.

13:23.552 --> 13:26.597
By the end of the day,
I want you gone.

13:30.809 --> 13:31.894
All right.

13:49.370 --> 13:50.579
Rise and shine.

13:50.663 --> 13:51.580
Up and at 'em.

13:51.664 --> 13:53.415
Let's go, Erica.

13:55.960 --> 13:56.835
What time is it?

13:56.919 --> 13:57.920
9:30.

13:58.003 --> 13:59.380
{\an3}In the morning?
Yep.

13:59.463 --> 14:00.714
Kitchen quits serving at 10:00.

14:00.798 --> 14:02.049
{\an1}BRANDON:
And your doctor's

14:02.132 --> 14:03.926
appointment is at 11:00.

14:04.009 --> 14:05.594
{\an3}Your gynecologist
appointment is 11:00.

14:05.678 --> 14:08.097
Your therapy session
is at 1:00.

14:08.180 --> 14:09.723
Leaving you plenty of time

14:09.807 --> 14:12.768
in between to call Iris
and tell her you're okay.

14:12.851 --> 14:15.062
I thought I was out of jail.

14:15.145 --> 14:16.564
{\an3}For the moment.
We tried to

14:16.647 --> 14:18.023
help you once,
you took advantage of us.

14:18.107 --> 14:18.983
We're not going to let you

14:19.066 --> 14:20.943
do that again.
That's right.

14:21.026 --> 14:22.278
You do everything
we tell you to,

14:22.361 --> 14:23.654
everything will be fine.

14:23.737 --> 14:25.322
Are we clear?

14:25.406 --> 14:28.784
(sighing):
We're clear.

14:28.867 --> 14:31.412
Good, now, where is the
rest of the stuff you stole?

14:37.543 --> 14:38.627
(sighs)

14:42.214 --> 14:44.425
{\an3}How long have
you lived here?

14:44.508 --> 14:45.676
Couple months.

14:45.759 --> 14:47.761
{\an1}But I'm just renting
while they install

14:47.845 --> 14:51.223
a master bath at
my home on Rodeo.

14:56.145 --> 14:57.104
Hey, hey!

14:57.187 --> 14:58.981
I told Riggs,
I said "Riggs,

14:59.064 --> 15:01.609
{\an3}Erica's gonna
make my party."

15:01.692 --> 15:02.985
What are we celebrating?

15:03.068 --> 15:06.155
Um, Riggs won't like this.

15:06.238 --> 15:07.990
I just need to pick up
a few things, okay?

15:08.073 --> 15:09.992
Riggs totally
doesn't need to know.

15:12.703 --> 15:16.582
The big-ticket items
are already pawned.

15:18.250 --> 15:20.669
{\an1}BRANDON:
She's completely stoned.

15:20.753 --> 15:22.838
You don't look so good.

15:22.921 --> 15:25.257
Yeah, but I feel great.

15:27.092 --> 15:29.011
But the trinket box is here.

15:29.094 --> 15:30.804
So, you can get
off my case now.

15:30.888 --> 15:32.556
Is everything there?

15:32.640 --> 15:34.850
BRANDON:
Yeah, I think so.

15:34.933 --> 15:38.020
{\an1}Except for the silver pocket
watch that Dylan gave me.

15:38.103 --> 15:39.855
I haven't seen it.

15:41.065 --> 15:44.026
Look, I said I haven't
seen it, okay?

15:44.109 --> 15:45.027
JULIE:
Hello?

15:45.110 --> 15:46.195
It's me, the birthday girl.

15:46.278 --> 15:48.656
Oh!

15:48.739 --> 15:49.990
{\an1}No way.
Yeah.

15:50.074 --> 15:51.367
{\an5}Today?
Uh-huh, yeah.
Big one eight.

15:51.450 --> 15:53.160
{\an3}I'm legal.

15:53.243 --> 15:54.995
In an illegal sort of way.

15:55.079 --> 15:58.540
Oh, man, Riggs gave me
this awesome present.

15:58.624 --> 16:00.042
I'd share, but...

16:00.125 --> 16:02.544
it all went up in smoke.

16:02.628 --> 16:03.837
{\an3}(chuckling)

16:03.921 --> 16:05.047
{\an1}KELLY:
Julie, you should

16:05.130 --> 16:06.006
let us help you.

16:06.090 --> 16:07.049
{\an3}Get it?

16:07.132 --> 16:08.384
Up in smoke.

16:13.430 --> 16:14.890
Happy Birthday.

16:14.973 --> 16:17.851
Here, hold this for me.

16:17.935 --> 16:19.603
{\an1}It's a gift
from my brother.

16:23.023 --> 16:25.067
Look, I hate to break
up this little party.

16:25.150 --> 16:26.902
But, uh, we gotta go.

16:26.985 --> 16:30.739
{\an3}No, no, no, no, no,
wait, wait, wait, 'cause

16:30.823 --> 16:33.075
Riggs said he-he's gonna
bring me a carrot cake,

16:33.158 --> 16:36.245
{\an3}you know, and, and-and
those little hats.

16:36.328 --> 16:37.913
Can-Can you see him

16:37.996 --> 16:39.415
in one of those hats?

16:39.498 --> 16:41.542
{\an4}Really.
I don't think
we should leave her.

16:41.625 --> 16:44.378
With a little clown face on
it and, and, and the string.

16:44.461 --> 16:46.422
{\an3}(Julie laughs)
There's nothing we can do.

16:48.006 --> 16:50.926
(laughing)

16:51.009 --> 16:53.262
CARLY:
<i>Don't ask me to do that.</i>

16:53.345 --> 16:54.930
But she'll listen to you.
I hardly know her.

16:55.013 --> 16:56.098
You've been in her situation.

16:56.181 --> 16:57.891
{\an3}I won't lecture her
on the horrors

16:57.975 --> 16:59.601
{\an5}of single parenting...
You don't have
to lecture her.

16:59.685 --> 17:01.770
And I can't tell her what
to do with her own body.

17:01.854 --> 17:03.605
Yeah, but supposedly
it's my kid.

17:03.689 --> 17:05.315
On the one hand, she wants
me to take responsibility.

17:05.398 --> 17:06.942
But on the other hand,

17:07.025 --> 17:09.778
{\an1}she won't listen to
a word I have to say.

17:09.862 --> 17:11.780
Steve, you have choices.

17:11.864 --> 17:13.073
{\an1}Really?

17:13.156 --> 17:15.284
What choice do I have?
Cloth or disposable?

17:16.326 --> 17:19.829
Look, even if
the child is yours,

17:19.913 --> 17:22.624
{\an3}there are different
levels of responsibility.

17:22.708 --> 17:24.792
You don't have to be
a full-time dad.

17:24.877 --> 17:26.336
Please, you really believe that?

17:26.420 --> 17:29.590
In a situation like this,
yes, I do.

17:34.386 --> 17:36.764
You never told me
about Zach's dad.

17:39.016 --> 17:39.975
Well, we met in high school

17:40.058 --> 17:43.979
{\an3}and, uh, dated five months
before I got pregnant.

17:44.062 --> 17:46.482
I wanted to have the
baby and he didn't.

17:46.565 --> 17:49.651
Oh, so,
where was his choice there?

17:49.735 --> 17:51.487
{\an1}Huh?

17:52.613 --> 17:53.697
{\an1}You guys!

17:53.781 --> 17:55.616
{\an1}I reached the
Polar Bear level.

17:55.699 --> 17:57.451
Oh, you mean the
unbearable level?

17:57.534 --> 17:58.660
Uh-huh.

17:58.744 --> 18:00.204
I used my lucky marble.

18:00.287 --> 18:02.831
Oh, this I've gotta see.

18:02.915 --> 18:04.333
{\an3}Steve?
Yeah?

18:04.416 --> 18:06.376
What's Jodi's number?

18:07.419 --> 18:08.462
Thanks.

18:12.841 --> 18:14.176
(chuckling)

18:14.259 --> 18:15.677
Look at you!

18:15.761 --> 18:17.763
Two hands, two hands!

18:23.894 --> 18:25.813
{\an1}This is where I work.
Wow.

18:25.896 --> 18:27.314
{\an3}Brandon, front
page is all set.

18:27.397 --> 18:29.358
Ah, Terri, Erica.
Erica, Terri.

18:29.441 --> 18:31.860
Yeah. Listen, we're not
ripping it up, are we?

18:31.944 --> 18:33.028
Couldn't say.

18:33.111 --> 18:34.154
{\an1}Not yet, anyway.
Okay, good.

18:34.238 --> 18:35.489
We're 90 minutes to press.

18:35.572 --> 18:37.866
{\an3}I'm gonna need 15 minutes
to redo the layout

18:37.950 --> 18:40.118
and the paper's gotta be
on the streets tonight.

18:49.127 --> 18:51.255
{\an1}You know, I did
everything you told me to.

18:51.338 --> 18:53.382
You know, we're
doing you a favor,

18:53.465 --> 18:54.925
not the other way around.

18:55.008 --> 18:57.719
You make me see a shrink
and I'm supposed to thank you?

18:57.803 --> 19:00.514
Yeah, you are.

19:02.140 --> 19:05.102
Look, I brought you down here
because I want to do a story

19:05.185 --> 19:06.436
{\an3}on you.

19:06.520 --> 19:08.021
Like that's gonna happen.

19:08.105 --> 19:09.523
About your life.

19:09.606 --> 19:11.066
Not using your name.

19:11.149 --> 19:12.734
Not using your picture.

19:12.818 --> 19:14.027
I just want to tell your story.

19:14.111 --> 19:14.903
Why?

19:14.987 --> 19:16.989
Because I think it might
help some people.

19:17.072 --> 19:20.367
Brandon, girls who do what I do,
they don't read your paper.

19:20.450 --> 19:22.911
Well, maybe they don't.

19:22.995 --> 19:23.745
Maybe they do.

19:23.829 --> 19:26.540
{\an3}Maybe just one.
But if your story

19:26.623 --> 19:28.959
can help that one person,
I think it's worth telling.

19:29.042 --> 19:31.044
The question is:

19:31.128 --> 19:32.129
Do you?

19:42.097 --> 19:43.432
Thanks.

19:43.515 --> 19:46.059
Not a problem.

19:46.143 --> 19:47.811
Are you sure I'm not imposing?

19:47.895 --> 19:49.771
{\an3}If you were
I'd let you know.

19:49.855 --> 19:51.607
{\an1}Thanks, I just thought
it might be a good place

19:51.690 --> 19:52.774
{\an1}to get some
sketching done.

19:52.858 --> 19:54.276
You can stay as long
as you like.

19:54.359 --> 19:56.278
Well, it shouldn't
take that long.

19:56.361 --> 19:57.946
Besides, David doesn't
have that much stuff.

19:58.030 --> 20:00.407
Donna...

20:00.490 --> 20:02.451
Relax.

20:04.077 --> 20:05.454
It's not just the move.

20:05.537 --> 20:08.206
It's, uh, it's the timing.

20:08.290 --> 20:11.126
I just...
I feel like I'm kicking him

20:11.209 --> 20:12.419
when he's down.

20:12.502 --> 20:14.296
I mean, how much
trouble is David in?

20:14.379 --> 20:15.631
(sighs)

20:15.714 --> 20:18.258
If nothing changes, he's
going to lose the club.

20:18.342 --> 20:20.302
And your role in all this?

20:20.385 --> 20:21.970
I don't know.

20:22.054 --> 20:23.805
I mean, I thought I did,

20:23.889 --> 20:27.100
but now I'm not sure.

20:27.184 --> 20:28.477
See, whenever
I'm not sure of something

20:28.560 --> 20:29.811
I like to go for a sail.

20:29.895 --> 20:32.272
Kind of, uh, clears
my head, you know?

20:32.356 --> 20:33.190
I'd like that.

20:33.273 --> 20:35.150
All right, I'll get us set.

20:35.233 --> 20:37.194
And you, uh, take care
of the lunch situation.

20:37.277 --> 20:39.154
Okay.

20:39.237 --> 20:40.364
Looks like you, uh,

20:40.447 --> 20:42.950
{\an1}had quite the
dinner party, huh?

20:43.033 --> 20:45.661
It was a surprise
and, uh, I hate surprises.

20:45.744 --> 20:47.204
(giggles)

20:57.005 --> 20:59.633
{\an3}I gotta tell you,
I agree with your father.

20:59.716 --> 21:02.511
I don't know, I mean...

21:02.594 --> 21:04.304
bankruptcy seems
so irresponsible.

21:04.388 --> 21:06.348
Oh, as opposed to
stiffing your creditors,

21:06.431 --> 21:08.350
{\an3}right?

21:08.433 --> 21:09.977
See, I'm not planning

21:10.060 --> 21:11.520
on stiffing anyone, I just...

21:11.603 --> 21:13.522
I need more time to pay
them back, that's all.

21:13.605 --> 21:16.191
Well, that's what filing
for Chapter 11's all about.

21:17.234 --> 21:19.278
I just want to do
the right thing.

21:21.905 --> 21:25.033
Well, when you figure out what
the hell that is, let me know.

21:25.117 --> 21:27.327
You going to take the test?

21:27.411 --> 21:30.372
Is that the right thing?

21:30.455 --> 21:32.207
I think so.

21:32.290 --> 21:33.875
What about the money
to pay for it?

21:33.959 --> 21:36.920
Definitely don't borrow it

21:37.004 --> 21:38.380
from a loan shark.

21:38.463 --> 21:39.423
You didn't?

21:41.299 --> 21:42.217
Yeah.

21:42.300 --> 21:44.094
{\an1}I, uh,

21:44.177 --> 21:45.387
I borrowed 22 five.

21:45.470 --> 21:46.930
I still owe 15 grand.

21:47.014 --> 21:48.473
By when?

21:50.308 --> 21:51.268
Yesterday.

21:51.351 --> 21:53.937
So, this loan shark,

21:54.021 --> 21:55.272
this is, uh... not the

21:55.355 --> 21:57.524
leg-breaking kind of
loan shark, is it?

21:57.607 --> 21:58.734
{\an1}No.

21:58.817 --> 22:01.278
No, he-he knows I'm a musician.

22:01.361 --> 22:03.405
He'll, uh...

22:03.488 --> 22:05.323
He'll probably start
with my fingers.

22:09.453 --> 22:11.413
(doorbell rings)

22:12.622 --> 22:13.957
Hi.
Hi.

22:14.041 --> 22:15.292
{\an1}Come on in.
Thanks for coming.

22:15.375 --> 22:17.336
Thanks for asking.

22:17.419 --> 22:18.962
{\an3}You know, considering
the situation,

22:19.046 --> 22:20.255
{\an3}I wouldn't blame
you for hating me.

22:20.338 --> 22:23.091
{\an1}Oh, no. Here, uh,
you want to sit down?

22:23.175 --> 22:25.260
{\an1}Oh, be careful of the
obstacle course, though.

22:25.343 --> 22:26.428
(chuckles)

22:34.352 --> 22:37.272
You know, before I was pregnant,
everything about kids scared me.

22:37.355 --> 22:40.442
{\an3}I mean, the mess, the crying,
the responsibility thing.

22:40.525 --> 22:43.320
{\an1}Toys all over the place.
What? I don't see any toys.

22:43.403 --> 22:46.239
{\an3}Right. And the whole
"pregnant is beautiful" trip.

22:46.323 --> 22:47.741
You know, ignore
the hypertension,

22:47.824 --> 22:49.493

22:53.330 --> 22:54.289
Right.

22:54.372 --> 22:56.375
You've got it, haven't you?

22:56.458 --> 22:58.794
Completely.

22:58.877 --> 23:00.128
Mmm.

23:00.212 --> 23:01.588
I miss feeling that way.

23:04.424 --> 23:06.343
Is he kicking?

23:06.426 --> 23:08.428
Oh, yeah. Like a fullback.

23:09.346 --> 23:10.764
Would you like to feel?

23:10.847 --> 23:11.723
Could I?

23:11.807 --> 23:13.350
Yeah.

23:17.687 --> 23:18.897
I love that.

23:20.816 --> 23:23.193
So, I'm guessing you
didn't invite me over

23:23.276 --> 23:24.820

of being pregnant.

23:24.903 --> 23:28.490

23:28.573 --> 23:31.868

you're doing is wrong.

23:34.579 --> 23:35.705
Is that what you think?

23:35.789 --> 23:38.458
No. Actually, no.

23:39.751 --> 23:43.672
Being a single parent
is the hardest thing,

23:43.755 --> 23:46.466
{\an1}but no matter
how they change your life,

23:46.550 --> 23:48.176
children are a blessing.

23:50.053 --> 23:52.472
Well,
I wish Steve believed that.

23:52.556 --> 23:54.307
I think he'll come around.

23:54.391 --> 23:55.267
And if he doesn't?

23:55.350 --> 23:56.226
He will.

23:56.309 --> 23:57.394
I know him pretty well,

23:57.477 --> 23:59.020
and he's not the type of guy

23:59.104 --> 24:00.397
who'd shirk his responsibility.

24:06.653 --> 24:08.363
Ah. Here it is. Ugh.

24:08.446 --> 24:11.199
{\an3}It must've fallen down behind
there while we were out.

24:11.283 --> 24:12.284
Hmm.

24:13.910 --> 24:15.495
{\an3}Well, I had a really
good time today.

24:15.579 --> 24:18.373
{\an4}NOAH:
It's amazing what some sea
air can do for your mood, huh?

24:18.456 --> 24:20.041
{\an3}Yeah. And I've decided
not to feel guilty

24:20.125 --> 24:21.376
{\an3}about something
that's not my fault.

24:21.459 --> 24:22.335
{\an1}NOAH:
There's a plan.

24:22.419 --> 24:23.879

24:38.310 --> 24:40.270

24:40.353 --> 24:42.355
{\an1}NOAH:

24:42.439 --> 24:44.232

24:50.447 --> 24:51.406

25:02.834 --> 25:04.586

25:04.669 --> 25:07.088
{\an1}BRANDON: No, I said
I wouldn't use your name.

25:07.172 --> 25:09.424

the bad publicity he can get.

25:09.507 --> 25:11.009
He's not going to like this.

25:11.092 --> 25:14.763
You may not know this now,
but today was a good day.

25:17.515 --> 25:20.477
{\an3}Um, Brandon, there's
somebody here to see you.

25:20.560 --> 25:23.104
{\an3}She says she's from
the DA's office.

25:28.693 --> 25:29.945
I'm Brandon Walsh.

25:30.028 --> 25:31.947
{\an3}Assistant District
Attorney Debra Mills.

25:32.030 --> 25:33.448
Hello, Assistant
District Attorney Debra Mills.

25:33.531 --> 25:34.783
What can I do for you?

25:34.866 --> 25:36.993
I read your story
on teen prostitution.

25:37.077 --> 25:38.286
{\an1}Mm-hmm.

25:38.370 --> 25:39.454
I want to put together a case

25:39.537 --> 25:40.789
against the pimp
you wrote about.

25:40.872 --> 25:43.083
Good, good.
I hope you nail the guy.

25:43.166 --> 25:45.877
{\an3}I will. If you give
me your source.

25:49.381 --> 25:51.299
I promised her anonymity.

25:51.383 --> 25:55.428
Riggs is evil, but even
a guy who preys on kids

25:55.512 --> 25:57.013
has the right to
face his accuser.

25:57.097 --> 25:59.766
He beats her when
she doesn't earn enough money.

25:59.849 --> 26:01.810
What do you think
he's going to do to her

26:01.893 --> 26:02.978
if she helps
put him in prison?

26:03.061 --> 26:04.479
Hmm?
We'll protect her.

26:04.562 --> 26:06.439
That's what I'm trying to do.

26:07.732 --> 26:10.193
{\an3}Without her,
there's no case.

26:10.277 --> 26:11.861
I can't help you.

26:11.945 --> 26:13.196
Sorry.

26:16.116 --> 26:18.326
I'm going to do whatever I
can to prosecute Mr. Riggs.

26:18.410 --> 26:19.244
{\an1}Mm-hmm.

26:19.327 --> 26:22.122
If that means coming down
with both feet

26:22.205 --> 26:24.457
on anyone who stands in my way,

26:24.541 --> 26:26.376
then that's
what I'm going to do.

26:48.982 --> 26:51.609
Sorry.
I thought you'd be done by now.

26:54.404 --> 26:56.698
{\an3}Um...

26:56.781 --> 26:58.783
I got one box left.

27:03.705 --> 27:06.875
Actually, I've had one box left
for about an hour.

27:08.585 --> 27:10.003
Where have you been?

27:10.086 --> 27:11.880
Just out.

27:13.965 --> 27:16.301
You know,
I still have hope for us.

27:16.384 --> 27:18.720
But you want me to go.

27:20.764 --> 27:22.557
Please.

27:28.104 --> 27:30.106

27:31.983 --> 27:34.027

You sure you're
okay with this?

27:50.627 --> 27:52.253
{\an1}We'll be fine.
All right.

27:52.337 --> 27:54.172
{\an3}It's just with David
moving his stuff out today,

27:54.255 --> 27:55.423
{\an3}I don't think that
Donna should be alone.

27:55.507 --> 27:57.050
It's not a problem.

27:58.676 --> 28:00.261
Now, I know you haven't asked

28:00.345 --> 28:02.764
{\an3}for my opinion,
but I think

28:02.847 --> 28:04.724
you should give the district
attorney Erica's name.

28:04.808 --> 28:06.559
Promised her
I wouldn't do it.

28:06.643 --> 28:07.560
I know, Brandon,

28:07.644 --> 28:09.437
but think about what we've seen.

28:09.521 --> 28:10.271
Kelly, I'm not going to expose

28:10.355 --> 28:12.732
Erica to Riggs.
You have to trust

28:12.816 --> 28:13.942
the system to take care of her.

28:14.025 --> 28:15.860
{\an1}ERICA:
And if they don't?

28:17.362 --> 28:19.656
Erica, I promised to keep
your name out of it and that's

28:19.739 --> 28:21.449
what I'm going to do.

28:21.533 --> 28:23.493
End of story.

28:40.009 --> 28:41.469
Okay, okay, he's asleep.

28:41.553 --> 28:43.012
Did you tell Jodi
how wrong she is?

28:43.096 --> 28:45.473
I tried to, but I couldn't.

28:45.557 --> 28:46.975
The fact is,

28:47.058 --> 28:48.810
I agree with what she's doing.

28:48.893 --> 28:49.894
You what?

28:51.396 --> 28:53.314
Zach's never met his father,

28:53.398 --> 28:55.942
but he asks about
him all the time.

28:56.025 --> 28:58.486
What he looks like,
what he does...

28:58.570 --> 29:01.156
I thought the questions
would stop after awhile,

29:01.239 --> 29:02.782
but they never do.

29:04.075 --> 29:05.702
{\an3}See, kids are
constantly,

29:05.785 --> 29:09.497
constantly trying
to figure out

29:09.581 --> 29:10.707
their place in the world.

29:10.790 --> 29:12.834
{\an3}And that starts
with their parents.

29:14.127 --> 29:16.546
Jodi's child will do
the exact same thing.

29:16.629 --> 29:18.173
{\an3}And...

29:18.256 --> 29:20.175
that's why,
if you are the father...

29:20.258 --> 29:21.676
Which I am not.

29:21.759 --> 29:24.846
...you need to be a part
of your child's life.

29:26.431 --> 29:28.224
Even if it's going
to ruin my life?

29:28.308 --> 29:30.310
But it won't.

29:31.311 --> 29:33.188

Yeah, I mean, I-I saw
David before he left,

30:17.524 --> 30:19.901
and that was
kind of rough on me.

30:19.984 --> 30:22.070

34:00.913 --> 34:02.623
(glass smashes)

34:02.707 --> 34:03.916
(patrons laughing)

34:11.882 --> 34:14.342
{\an1}You got till tomorrow
afternoon, and next time,

34:14.427 --> 34:16.429
Tiny's not gonna be so gentle.

34:16.512 --> 34:17.972
(grunts)

34:23.101 --> 34:25.103
(bottleneck shatters)

34:28.065 --> 34:30.067
(David groans)

34:31.735 --> 34:33.279
You all right, man?

34:33.362 --> 34:34.989
(panting)

34:35.072 --> 34:36.991
(engine turns nearby)

34:37.074 --> 34:39.327
Hey, no thanks necessary.

34:39.409 --> 34:41.746
I'm happy to do it.

34:56.135 --> 34:58.346
{\an3}Getting tested is the
right thing to do.

34:58.429 --> 34:59.680
It's a tough call.

34:59.764 --> 35:01.682
I know, and I'm proud
of you for making it.

35:01.766 --> 35:03.142
{\an3}Huh.
Good luck.

35:03.226 --> 35:04.811
Thanks.

35:06.604 --> 35:08.481
KELLY:
Erica, you have to call the D.A.

35:08.564 --> 35:12.193
Brandon said
I didn't have to, okay?

35:12.276 --> 35:13.236
Well, he's wrong.

35:13.319 --> 35:15.071
{\an1}Look, the district
attorney

35:15.154 --> 35:15.947
will protect you from Riggs.

35:16.030 --> 35:18.032
Look, Riggs is the one
who protects me.

35:18.115 --> 35:20.076
How, by sending you
on the streets?

35:20.159 --> 35:21.202
He's nice to me.

35:21.285 --> 35:23.079
Okay? He gives me things.

35:23.162 --> 35:24.372
He wants his 40 bucks.

35:24.455 --> 35:25.540
You coming back

35:25.623 --> 35:27.041
in one piece is optional.

35:27.125 --> 35:28.125
I'm not doing it.

35:28.209 --> 35:30.086
{\an3}BRANDON:
Erica, why don't, uh,

35:30.169 --> 35:31.045
you go in the kitchen

35:31.128 --> 35:32.880
and get some breakfast,
give us a second?

35:32.964 --> 35:34.173
I'm not doing it.

35:35.633 --> 35:37.969
{\an3}And you...

35:38.052 --> 35:39.637
can't make me.

35:44.183 --> 35:45.226
So how's Donna doing?

35:45.309 --> 35:46.769
{\an1}Don't change
the subject, Brandon.

35:46.853 --> 35:49.063
I am changing the subject,
because this matter's closed.

35:49.146 --> 35:50.606
I could call the D.A. myself.

35:50.690 --> 35:52.066
Sure. But you won't.

35:52.149 --> 35:53.234
Why not?

35:53.317 --> 35:54.277
(door closes)

35:58.155 --> 36:00.157
(car departs)

36:03.578 --> 36:03.911
{\an1}She took my keys.
They were on the counter.

36:03.995 --> 36:05.246
Great. Let's go.

36:07.540 --> 36:09.917
She probably went
to the apartment.

36:10.001 --> 36:11.419
DONNA:
<i>Okay, everybody in wardrobe.</i>

36:11.502 --> 36:13.588
<i>We shoot in ten minutes.</i>

36:20.970 --> 36:22.388
I want to talk to you.

36:22.471 --> 36:23.931
Now is not a good time.

36:24.015 --> 36:25.600
Well, it is for me.

36:25.683 --> 36:26.684
David, please. Look...

36:26.767 --> 36:28.603
I really don't have anything
to say to you right now.

36:28.686 --> 36:30.229
What, you said it all to Noah?

36:30.313 --> 36:31.606
{\an3}I mean,

36:31.689 --> 36:32.940
when you weren't kissing him.

36:33.024 --> 36:34.609
What are you talking about?

36:36.903 --> 36:39.113
You know, I thought maybe
yesterday was a bad day

36:39.196 --> 36:40.698
{\an3}for you, too;
I guess I was wrong.

36:40.781 --> 36:42.950
Yeah, it <i> was</i> a bad day for me.

36:43.034 --> 36:44.285
Why'd you lie about it?

36:44.368 --> 36:45.786
What did I lie about?

36:45.870 --> 36:47.455
Oh, so you weren't with Noah?

36:48.497 --> 36:49.665
You know what?

36:49.749 --> 36:51.000
Where I go and what I do

36:51.083 --> 36:52.543
is really
none of your business.

36:53.961 --> 36:55.796
Did you sleep with him?

36:57.381 --> 37:00.593
I'm not having
this discussion with you.

37:00.676 --> 37:01.802
I'm not finished yet.

37:01.886 --> 37:03.763
Really?

37:03.846 --> 37:05.473
Well, I am.

37:15.733 --> 37:17.735
(woman moaning)

37:20.905 --> 37:23.366
Uh, Kel, here, call 911.

37:28.913 --> 37:30.665
KELLY:
Yes, it's an emergency.

37:30.748 --> 37:31.832
Someone's been
badly beaten.

37:31.916 --> 37:33.793
305 West Decker.

37:33.876 --> 37:35.711
I'm so sorry.

37:35.795 --> 37:36.837
{\an3}KELLY:
All right.

37:36.921 --> 37:38.839
What happened?

37:38.923 --> 37:40.675
Riggs said he had
a present for me.

37:40.758 --> 37:42.843
A special guy.

37:42.927 --> 37:44.136
For my birthday.

37:44.220 --> 37:46.180
A guy who would beat
the hell out of me.

37:46.263 --> 37:47.682
{\an3}Julie, everything's
going to be all right.

37:47.765 --> 37:49.642
The ambulance
is on its way.

37:49.725 --> 37:51.060
You know,
I have a brother, too,

37:51.143 --> 37:54.021
back in Colorado

37:54.105 --> 37:55.982
{\an1}who won't even
talk to me.

37:56.065 --> 37:59.026
And I miss him so much.

37:59.110 --> 38:01.362
{\an3}Here, I can't even
keep this safe.

38:01.445 --> 38:04.532
(Julie sobbing)

38:08.160 --> 38:09.704
It's okay, I'm sure he would've
wanted you

38:09.787 --> 38:12.039
{\an3}to have it.

38:12.123 --> 38:13.332
Thank you.

38:18.462 --> 38:21.132
What the hell's going on here?

38:21.215 --> 38:22.842
{\an3}She's been beaten up.
The police are on their way.

38:22.925 --> 38:24.760
{\an1}BRANDON:
They'll be here in a minute.

38:24.844 --> 38:26.178
Why don't you stick around?
I'm sure they'd love

38:26.262 --> 38:28.222
to talk to you.

38:28.306 --> 38:29.765
Come on.

38:29.849 --> 38:32.101
Let's get out of here.

38:32.184 --> 38:33.728
I said let's go!

38:35.146 --> 38:37.815
No. No more.

38:41.652 --> 38:43.904
(sirens approaching)

38:43.988 --> 38:45.239
You'll be back.

38:46.365 --> 38:48.409
You need me too much.

38:49.452 --> 38:50.828
(sirens continue blaring)

38:54.165 --> 38:56.208
It's okay.

38:58.002 --> 38:59.920
It's okay.
(sniffles)

39:10.598 --> 39:11.724
Hey.
Hi.

39:11.807 --> 39:14.268
What are you doing here?

39:14.351 --> 39:15.936
I thought you could use this.

39:16.020 --> 39:17.772
{\an3}Zach wanted you
to have it.

39:17.855 --> 39:20.024
It's his lucky marble.

39:20.107 --> 39:21.442
You told him?

39:21.525 --> 39:24.195
Only that you were a nice guy
who needed a break.

39:25.863 --> 39:26.989
A really nice guy.

39:27.073 --> 39:28.616
Thanks.

39:31.702 --> 39:33.913
Steve Sanders?

39:47.718 --> 39:49.804
Hey, David, um...

39:49.887 --> 39:51.597
there's some guys
asking about you.

39:52.723 --> 39:54.433
Sharkskin suits,
lots of chains?

39:54.517 --> 39:55.601
Yeah, they don't
look very happy.

39:55.684 --> 39:57.103
They're in the club.

39:57.186 --> 39:58.813
David, what's going on?

39:58.896 --> 40:01.315
{\an1}David?

40:15.746 --> 40:17.248
Here's the deal:

40:17.331 --> 40:19.041
I don't have the money.

40:20.918 --> 40:25.673
So whatever it is you have to do
to me, just do it, okay?

40:25.756 --> 40:27.049
I don't care anymore.

40:29.593 --> 40:31.595
That's nice.

40:32.763 --> 40:34.056
That's real macho.

40:34.140 --> 40:35.724
{\an3}Thing is,

40:35.808 --> 40:37.685
we don't have
a situation here.

40:37.768 --> 40:39.645
What are you talking about?

40:39.728 --> 40:41.230
I came to get paid.

40:41.313 --> 40:42.648
I got paid.

40:42.731 --> 40:44.150
15 grand?

40:44.233 --> 40:46.819
{\an3}With the extra interest,
$16,500, cash.

40:46.902 --> 40:48.654
You're a lucky man.

40:48.737 --> 40:50.531
Who paid you?

40:50.614 --> 40:53.617
Somebody who just saved you
from the beating of your life.

41:02.793 --> 41:04.587
(door opens)

41:04.670 --> 41:07.006
(sighs)

41:19.143 --> 41:20.895
(engine turns)

41:23.147 --> 41:25.691
{\an4}SANDS:
You just saved
David's ass.

41:43.167 --> 41:45.085
{\an1}I don't know about you guys,
but I'd really love

41:45.169 --> 41:47.254
{\an1}to listen to some music
right about now.

41:47.338 --> 41:48.380
Me, too.

41:48.464 --> 41:50.257
{\an3}Too bad we don't
have a stereo.

41:50.341 --> 41:51.926
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

41:52.009 --> 41:53.761
Look, I said
I'd go with you guys

41:53.844 --> 41:55.137
to the pawn shop
this afternoon.

41:55.221 --> 41:58.724
But first,
I have a phone call to make.

42:00.059 --> 42:01.560
(doorbell rings)

42:01.644 --> 42:03.479
{\an1}I better get that,
it might be the door.

42:03.562 --> 42:05.439
Yeah, you better.

42:05.522 --> 42:06.774
{\an1}ERICA:
Hey, uh, you know

42:06.857 --> 42:07.775
Brandon was saying that

42:07.858 --> 42:09.652
you work with a really good
outreach program.

42:09.735 --> 42:11.946
Do you think Julie
can get into it?

42:12.029 --> 42:14.657
I think that can be arranged.

42:14.740 --> 42:17.493
Good. I'm gonna call Iris

42:17.576 --> 42:19.078
{\an1}to let her
know I'm okay.

42:19.161 --> 42:20.955
{\an1}(dialing)

42:24.708 --> 42:27.753
{\an1}Assistant District
Attorney Debra Mills.

42:27.836 --> 42:29.964
What an unexpected,
pleasant surprise.

42:30.047 --> 42:32.758
You know the pimp in your
article is at the center

42:32.841 --> 42:34.760
of a very large
child prostitution ring.

42:34.843 --> 42:37.304
He's a bad man.

42:37.388 --> 42:39.807
And no one wants to see him
prosecuted more than I do.

42:39.890 --> 42:41.600
Then reveal your source.

42:41.684 --> 42:43.811
I'm afraid I can't do that.

42:43.894 --> 42:45.479
And the California

42:45.562 --> 42:46.605
Constitution
protects me from having to.

42:46.689 --> 42:50.317
It protects you against
a misdemeanor contempt charge.

42:50.401 --> 42:53.612
It doesn't protect you against
being charged with a felony.

42:53.696 --> 42:54.780
A felony?

42:54.863 --> 42:56.532
{\an3}By not giving up
your source,

42:56.615 --> 42:58.867
you're protecting
the pimp against arrest,

42:58.951 --> 43:00.786
trial and punishment.

43:00.869 --> 43:02.454
That makes you an accessory,

43:02.538 --> 43:03.497
{\an3}Mr. Walsh.

43:03.580 --> 43:04.665
No, you see,
I'm protecting a child.

43:04.748 --> 43:05.833
And by doing so,

43:05.916 --> 43:07.668
you're also protecting
a criminal.

43:07.751 --> 43:09.503
{\an3}Unless you
give him up...

43:09.586 --> 43:10.671
And the kid, too.

43:10.754 --> 43:12.840
...you're going to jail.

43:12.923 --> 43:14.008
{\an3}For a very

43:14.091 --> 43:15.759
long time.
