00:01.369 --> 00:03.537
ANNOUNCER: Thanks for
downloading this Fox show.

00:03.571 --> 00:05.739
And don't miss
all-new episodes on Fox.

00:07.608 --> 00:10.544
Previously on Empire...
LUCIOUS: I took the liberty
of calling the FBI

00:10.578 --> 00:12.846
ahead of time,
and I packed you something,

00:12.880 --> 00:15.183
just to give you
a fighting chance.

00:15.216 --> 00:16.650
ANDRE: Who is that?

00:16.684 --> 00:18.419
GUILIANA: The most powerful
person in Vegas:

00:18.452 --> 00:20.988
Charlotte Frost.

00:21.021 --> 00:22.923
You betrayed me
one time too many.

00:22.956 --> 00:24.358
Boy, you must be off your meds,

00:24.392 --> 00:26.894
thinking you're gonna
come at your daddy like this.

00:26.927 --> 00:29.263
ANDRE: You better fall back.
Vegas is mine.

00:29.297 --> 00:31.065
I told you, I'm not doing
that deal with Lucious.

00:31.099 --> 00:33.000
Lucious is not
our biggest problem.

00:33.033 --> 00:34.935
It's that bitch, Giuliana.

00:34.968 --> 00:36.537
I thought I'd
fly into town

00:36.570 --> 00:39.006
and make sure Lucious and I
were still on the same page.

00:39.039 --> 00:40.374
Inferno is

00:40.408 --> 00:41.742
the Vegas deal, Cookie.

00:41.775 --> 00:43.444
SUPERVISOR: We can't seem
to find your daughter.

00:43.477 --> 00:45.546
What?!
I want my daughter, man!

00:47.315 --> 00:48.949
MAN:
All right, let them have it.

00:48.982 --> 00:50.684
(remixed version of "Ain't That
a Kick in the Head" playing)

00:50.718 --> 00:53.421
* How lucky can one guy be? *

00:53.454 --> 00:55.923
* I kissed her
and she kissed me *

00:55.956 --> 00:57.458

00:57.491 --> 00:59.793
* Ain't that a kick
in the head? *

01:01.562 --> 01:04.532
* The room was
completely black *

01:04.565 --> 01:06.967
* I hugged her
and she hugged back *

01:07.000 --> 01:08.602
* Like the sailor
said, quote... *

01:08.636 --> 01:11.839
WOMAN: Welcome to
Laviticus, Las Vegas.

01:15.609 --> 01:18.812

* She's picked out
a king size bed *
* King size bed *

01:42.270 --> 01:44.438
* I couldn't feel any better
or I'd be sick *

01:44.472 --> 01:46.507
* Or I'd be sick, be sick *

01:46.540 --> 01:48.809
* Tell me quick, tell me quick *

01:48.842 --> 01:49.843

LUCIOUS: I would love
to make a toast to you guys.

01:58.686 --> 02:00.254
To Charlotte.

02:00.288 --> 02:02.623
Oh.
Without you, none of this
would've been possible.

02:02.656 --> 02:05.793
Giuliana and I are
forever grateful.

02:05.826 --> 02:07.428
WAITRESS: Ma'am.
Oh, no, thank you.

02:07.461 --> 02:09.863
No, it's okay. It's a
non-alcoholic cider.

02:09.897 --> 02:13.033
Oh. That's perfect.

02:13.066 --> 02:15.803
Well, I think
it's time you people...

02:16.704 --> 02:18.005
I mean, you hip-hop people

02:18.038 --> 02:19.440
have a proper seat

02:19.473 --> 02:21.709
at the table here in Vegas.

02:21.742 --> 02:24.378
I just hope it continues
to go smoothly.

02:24.412 --> 02:26.714
Cheers. Cheers.

02:31.352 --> 02:32.320
* Tell me quick... *

02:32.353 --> 02:34.121
Have a look, sir.

02:34.154 --> 02:37.124
* Goin' in, goin' in *

02:37.157 --> 02:39.227
* Tell me quick, tell me quick *

02:39.260 --> 02:40.228
* Goin' in, goin' in... *

02:40.261 --> 02:41.895
Handle it.

02:41.929 --> 02:43.864
Done.

02:43.897 --> 02:45.566
Excuse me, everyone.

02:45.599 --> 02:48.101
I have to attend to something
downstairs for a minute.

02:50.404 --> 02:52.373

Are we done?

02:52.406 --> 02:55.175
Okay, okay, okay. (laughs)

02:58.579 --> 03:00.581
That's it? Okay.

03:00.614 --> 03:02.616
Let's see. Come
on, give me some.

03:04.385 --> 03:07.154
Lucky night. (chuckles)

03:07.187 --> 03:10.023
Yes. I'm betting it all
on black, baby.

03:10.057 --> 03:13.026
Don't matter what number.
You always bet on black.

03:13.060 --> 03:14.862
I told you not
to do this.

03:14.895 --> 03:16.330
What am I doing?

03:16.364 --> 03:19.367
The gaming commissioner
is right upstairs,

03:19.400 --> 03:21.402
and you're not gonna
cost us our license.

03:21.435 --> 03:23.871
COOKIE:
Mm, o license?

03:23.904 --> 03:26.006
As in yours and mines?

03:26.039 --> 03:27.708
Or are you talking
about that bitch

03:27.741 --> 03:29.510
who's dragging you around
by your salty gonads?

03:29.543 --> 03:30.911
Okay, get her
out of here.

03:30.944 --> 03:33.714
Don't touch me.
I can walk.

03:35.783 --> 03:39.620
Oh, wait, I'm not going
nowhere without my money.

03:41.088 --> 03:43.156

MAN: Hey, free chips!

03:45.092 --> 03:46.093

Hey!

03:46.126 --> 03:47.895
Get your hands off of me!
Get off of me!

03:47.928 --> 03:50.230
I will shut
this place down!

03:50.264 --> 03:53.200
That goes for you, too,
you irrelevant bitch!

03:53.233 --> 03:54.234
You are canceled!

03:54.268 --> 03:55.736
Get off of me!

03:55.769 --> 03:57.371
Get off of me!

03:57.405 --> 03:58.772
LUCIOUS:
It's times like this

03:58.806 --> 04:00.608
that the family
needs to stay together.

04:02.510 --> 04:05.145
And trust me,
we are united on this one.

04:05.178 --> 04:06.380
COOKIE:
Yes, Hakeem,

04:06.414 --> 04:08.382
and you know
it's our top priority

04:08.416 --> 04:10.217
that we find
and bring Bella home.

04:10.250 --> 04:11.719
That's the only thing
that matters.

04:11.752 --> 04:14.154
Yeah, stay strong,
little brother.

04:15.289 --> 04:16.324
That's Bella.

04:16.357 --> 04:17.825
COOKIE:
No, no, no, Hakeem.

04:17.858 --> 04:19.327
She got my daughter.

04:19.360 --> 04:20.894
Hakeem. Get him.
Keem.

04:20.928 --> 04:22.396
You took my daughter?!
Hakeem, stop that.

04:22.430 --> 04:23.897
Hakeem, wait.
Excuse me.

04:23.931 --> 04:24.932
JAMAL:
Stop, stop, stop!

04:24.965 --> 04:26.300
It's not her.
I'm so sorry.

04:26.334 --> 04:27.668
I'm so sorry.
Man, it's a little boy.

04:27.701 --> 04:29.069
It's not Bella.
Come on.

04:29.102 --> 04:30.103
I'm so sorry.

04:30.137 --> 04:31.339
I'm sorry.

04:31.372 --> 04:33.106
It's okay.

04:33.140 --> 04:34.141
I thought it was her, Ma.

04:34.174 --> 04:35.443
I know, baby.
Come here.

04:35.476 --> 04:37.411
Look, take him upstairs
to my office, okay?

04:37.445 --> 04:39.079
Yeah.

04:39.112 --> 04:41.682
That's the third time
he's done that.

04:41.715 --> 04:44.117
Every time he sees a baby,
he thinks it's Bella.

04:44.151 --> 04:46.119
Yeah, well,
I know the right person

04:46.153 --> 04:47.521
that could help find Bella.
Okay.

04:47.555 --> 04:48.589
I'm-a track him down,

04:48.622 --> 04:50.257
and then I'm-a let you know
when I find out.

04:50.290 --> 04:51.659
I got to hit a meeting.

04:51.692 --> 04:53.661
Uh, wait a minute.
Hakeem needs us right now.

GIULIANA:
Inferno is gonna be

05:12.012 --> 05:14.782
the biggest live show
Las Vegas has ever seen.

05:14.815 --> 05:17.017
We're gonna do for the Strip
what Hamilton did for Broadway.

05:17.050 --> 05:18.285
It's gonna be hot.

05:18.318 --> 05:20.320
You got to trust me
on this, Charlotte.

05:20.354 --> 05:23.290
Everybody thinks they're gonna
be the next Hamilton, Giuliana.

05:23.323 --> 05:25.659
Look, I've heard this pitch
a million times.

05:25.693 --> 05:27.160
Yeah, but what you haven't
heard is my new music.

05:27.194 --> 05:29.463
No, thank you. I don't drink.

05:29.497 --> 05:31.231
I respect that.

05:31.264 --> 05:33.200
Can I get you some coffee?

05:33.233 --> 05:35.302
No, I don't drink
alcohol or coffee.

05:35.335 --> 05:36.670
I'm Mormon.

05:36.704 --> 05:37.971
LUCIOUS (chuckles):
Oh.

05:38.005 --> 05:40.474
Silly me. All this time,
I thought you was Mexican.

05:40.508 --> 05:43.210
And I thought
you were black,

05:43.243 --> 05:44.512
but I have no idea whether

05:44.545 --> 05:46.213
you're Muslim or Christian
or anything else,

05:46.246 --> 05:48.315
because I don't make
assumptions on your religion

05:48.348 --> 05:50.718
based on race or ethnicity.
Wait a minute.

05:50.751 --> 05:52.152
I was just making a joke.
(phone vibrating)

05:52.185 --> 05:53.754
I wasn't trying to...
Oh. Sorry.

05:53.787 --> 05:56.156
I have to have lunch
with my old pal Rudy.

05:56.189 --> 05:58.426
(chuckles)
Lucious, listen to me.

05:58.459 --> 06:02.329
Make sure this Inferno doesn't
open up the gates of my town

06:02.362 --> 06:04.331
to a bunch of hip-hop
hooligans from hell.

06:04.364 --> 06:06.199
Giuliana.

06:06.233 --> 06:09.002
Thank you, Charlotte.

06:09.036 --> 06:10.504
Thank you for coming.

06:10.538 --> 06:12.506
A Mormon?

06:12.540 --> 06:14.274
Yeah, I should've known that.

06:14.307 --> 06:16.076
Okay? My bad. I'm sorry.

06:16.109 --> 06:17.678
GIULIANA: It's a little
too late for "I'm sorry."

06:17.711 --> 06:19.513
You could've cost us
our gaming license.

06:19.547 --> 06:21.515
Mormons run
the gaming commission.

06:21.549 --> 06:23.250
We can't afford
to offend anyone.

06:25.886 --> 06:27.254
(keypad beeping)

06:31.992 --> 06:35.429
Those the same ledgers from
your office safe in Vegas?

06:35.463 --> 06:37.565
Why are you in my business?

06:37.598 --> 06:40.801
Yes, they are. I take them
with me everywhere.

06:40.834 --> 06:42.736
They never leave my side.
Because Mr. Lyon's business

06:42.770 --> 06:45.038
is my business, that's why;
and it's just a question,

06:45.072 --> 06:47.074
so don't get your
panties in a bunch.
Thirsty.

06:50.010 --> 06:51.612
So, this is
what we're spending

06:51.645 --> 06:53.481
to keep the thugs
off the premises.

06:53.514 --> 06:58.886
I'm sure that Charlotte is
expecting some sort of melee.

06:58.919 --> 07:02.089
Lucious, he's
just so sloppy.

07:02.122 --> 07:03.657
That's just how
he dresses, sweetie.

07:03.691 --> 07:05.793
GIULIANA:
No.

07:05.826 --> 07:07.828
I don't trust him.

07:14.034 --> 07:17.104
Thirst, you like
that champagne?

07:17.137 --> 07:20.007
Yeah.

07:20.040 --> 07:22.009

When Cookie Met Lucious is
gonna be a game changer for us.

09:19.059 --> 09:20.093
Byron Moore.

09:20.127 --> 09:22.763
He's the best PR cat
in the business.

09:22.796 --> 09:24.464
And he has some
interesting insights

09:24.497 --> 09:25.866
that he shared with me

09:25.899 --> 09:28.268
about the releasing of our--
You know what?

09:28.301 --> 09:30.203
Just-just hit them, man.
I think we should hold off

09:30.237 --> 09:31.538
releasing When Cookie Met
Lucious for a few months.

09:31.571 --> 09:33.473
Are you joking?
Wait a minute, what?

09:33.506 --> 09:34.608
Why the hell, why
would we do that?
Are you stupid?

09:34.642 --> 09:36.276
What the hell would...
Inferno's...

09:36.309 --> 09:37.745
Inferno's market awareness
is through the roof.

09:37.778 --> 09:40.247
Two Empire releases
at the same time

09:40.280 --> 09:41.649
will cannibalize
attention from both.
Man.

09:41.682 --> 09:43.050
Excuse me, Byron.
No, man.

09:43.083 --> 09:44.785
Shut your dumb ass up.

09:44.818 --> 09:46.119
Dad, I agreed to do
a song with you,

09:46.153 --> 09:47.287
now you're pulling my album?

09:47.320 --> 09:49.790
I'm not pulling your album;
your album's incredible.

09:49.823 --> 09:52.559
But you only get one chance to
release it out into the world.

09:52.592 --> 09:54.427
Why do it under
all this competition?

09:54.461 --> 09:56.163
You need your own space.

09:56.196 --> 10:00.000
My own space.

10:00.033 --> 10:01.601
Damn, Dad.

10:01.635 --> 10:02.903
(stammers) Jamal!
I'm-I'm serious, man.

10:02.936 --> 10:04.104
He can't, he can't

10:04.137 --> 10:05.673
pull your album
without my...

10:05.706 --> 10:07.407
Jamal!
Byron, please go.

10:07.440 --> 10:09.677
Explain it to him the way
you explained it to me, please.

10:09.710 --> 10:11.011
Look, I'm not
trying to hurt him.

10:11.044 --> 10:12.579
I'm actually trying
to help him right now.

10:12.612 --> 10:13.814
And I got a bridge
in Brooklyn.

10:13.847 --> 10:15.582
Back off, Lucious.

10:15.615 --> 10:18.752
Look, Mr. Moore is the best
PR cat in this business.

10:18.786 --> 10:21.154
He's worked with Giuliana on...
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah!

10:21.188 --> 10:22.823
She recommended him?

10:22.856 --> 10:25.425
(chuckles) Hell no.

10:25.458 --> 10:27.594
Lucious, this company
belongs to me and...

10:27.627 --> 10:28.862
No, it's our company.

10:28.896 --> 10:31.131
It belongs to me and my family.

10:31.164 --> 10:33.166
You keep that bitch
out of my company.

10:33.200 --> 10:34.634
See, it's reasons
like that

10:34.668 --> 10:36.403
that you're kicked out
of the damn casino.

10:38.739 --> 10:42.342
Are you telling me I can't come
to ou casino in Vegas?

10:42.375 --> 10:46.980
It's Giuliana's
casino and mine.

10:47.014 --> 10:48.949
And you've been black-booked,

10:48.982 --> 10:50.550
meaning you're
prohibited.

10:50.583 --> 10:54.054
You can't enter the premises
of Laviticus Las Vegas.

11:05.933 --> 11:07.935
(elevator bell dings)

11:11.739 --> 11:14.708
Hey, where you going?
Wh-What happened?

11:14.742 --> 11:16.710
Seems like my work here is done.

11:16.744 --> 11:18.378
What, you want
to take a free shot?

11:18.411 --> 11:21.381
Giuliana?

11:21.414 --> 11:24.251
I didn't imagine his head
was that far up her ass.

11:24.284 --> 11:25.853
But, look, I'm-I'm in shock.

11:25.886 --> 11:28.255
I didn't see this coming.

11:28.288 --> 11:30.824
Look, for the record,
I respect your gangsta.

11:30.858 --> 11:32.726
You're a good mother.

11:32.760 --> 11:35.095
I'll keep my eyes and ears open
for your granddaughter.

11:38.098 --> 11:39.566
Uh, Thirsty.

11:39.599 --> 11:40.868
(elevator bell dings)

11:40.901 --> 11:43.203
Come to my house tonight.

11:43.236 --> 11:45.272
Huh?
Yeah.

11:45.305 --> 11:47.274
Having a little get-together.

11:47.307 --> 11:48.708
Think you might like it.

11:51.211 --> 11:52.780
(doorbell rings)

11:52.813 --> 11:54.447
Welcome to the resistance.

11:54.481 --> 11:58.018
You are officially
Team Cookie now.

11:58.051 --> 12:00.320
THIRSTY: And this is the team?
COOKIE: Mm-hmm.

12:03.256 --> 12:06.226
Giuliana has Lucious pinky-tied.

12:06.259 --> 12:07.694
We all know it.

12:07.727 --> 12:09.696
He's cut off
family members,

12:09.729 --> 12:11.264
friends, people
who've had his back,

12:11.298 --> 12:13.033
all for Vegas,
all for her.

12:13.066 --> 12:16.804
And that's why this team
is going to end her.

12:16.837 --> 12:18.438
Yeah, you mean "end" her, right?

12:18.471 --> 12:19.439
'Cause that
bitch is cold.

12:19.472 --> 12:20.440
I seen her pull a trig...

12:20.473 --> 12:21.708
Shut your mouth.

12:21.741 --> 12:23.376
No, no, no.
You seen her what?

12:23.410 --> 12:25.112
You shut your mouth!

12:25.145 --> 12:27.047
Hey!
COOKIE: Hey, hey,
everybody...

12:27.080 --> 12:28.148
Hey!
Come on!

12:28.181 --> 12:29.282
Get your hands off me!
(clamoring)

12:29.316 --> 12:30.283
Everybody, be quiet!

12:30.317 --> 12:31.651
Shut up!

12:31.684 --> 12:33.486
Quit acting like
a bunch of bitches!

12:33.520 --> 12:35.555
Thank you, Porsha.
Thank you.

12:35.588 --> 12:37.290
Somebody with some sense.

12:37.324 --> 12:39.059
Keep it together.

12:39.092 --> 12:41.294
Now, listen, let me
get one thing clear.

12:41.328 --> 12:44.097
I don't want to do this.
I wish I didn't have to.

12:44.131 --> 12:46.466
Giuliana is a cancer.

12:46.499 --> 12:49.736
Not just to Lucious,
but to the entire Empire.

12:49.769 --> 12:51.271
To the family!

12:51.304 --> 12:53.306
And if we don't
root that bitch out,

12:53.340 --> 12:55.075
we all die.
SHINE:
I'm sorry, Cookie.

12:55.108 --> 12:57.710
I can't do it.
I can't work with this fool.

12:58.846 --> 13:00.613
I'm out.
Are you serious?

13:00.647 --> 13:02.482
Oh, Drop, you, too?

13:02.515 --> 13:04.151
Oh, so y'all just gonna
bitch up like that?

13:04.184 --> 13:05.352
Say what you want.

13:05.385 --> 13:06.920
COOKIE: Oh, you just
gonna snatch up gifts?

13:06.954 --> 13:08.355
Wow.

13:08.388 --> 13:11.258
Okay. All right,
all right, all right.

13:11.291 --> 13:13.360
So we got eight.

13:13.393 --> 13:14.995
There's eight of us
if, Chicken and Marcel,

13:15.028 --> 13:16.496
y'all still coming to Vegas
with Hakeem?

13:16.529 --> 13:18.031
I'm in. You?

13:18.065 --> 13:20.667
COOKIE: Yeah, soldiers.
We still got soldiers.

13:20.700 --> 13:22.135
Now we just got to get...
No, Mom.

13:22.169 --> 13:24.037
I'm just gonna stay here
and wait for Bella.

13:24.071 --> 13:25.705
No, Hakeem, listen.

13:25.738 --> 13:29.109
There is nothing more important
than getting Bella back.

13:29.142 --> 13:30.477
Nothing. Right, Jamal?
JAMAL: Of course not.

13:30.510 --> 13:33.813
But, I mean, I got an album
coming out in ten days.

13:33.847 --> 13:36.349
I will be back in time
for the album release.

13:36.383 --> 13:39.486
Look, this is not
a side-hustle here!

13:39.519 --> 13:42.689
If we don't end this bitch,
there will be nothing left

13:42.722 --> 13:45.192
for you, for the album,
for Bella, none of us.

13:45.225 --> 13:46.426
Can't you see that?

13:51.198 --> 13:53.400
Oh, okay.

13:53.433 --> 13:54.734
This is great.

13:54.767 --> 13:56.536
You know I love you, Ma.
Yeah.

13:58.338 --> 13:59.772
Hmm.

14:01.041 --> 14:03.110
Great plan, Mom.

14:09.516 --> 14:12.052
Well, that obviously
wasn't the right team.

14:12.085 --> 14:13.186
Obviously not, Thirsty!

14:13.220 --> 14:14.521
Hey, Cookie,

14:14.554 --> 14:16.823
I can get the means
to do whatever.

14:16.856 --> 14:19.559
Who else can you trust?

14:23.030 --> 14:25.065
BECKY:
I have some bad news.

14:25.098 --> 14:27.000
I brought you in to explain

14:27.034 --> 14:29.102
that your recording budget
has been cut.

14:29.136 --> 14:30.337
The recording budget?

14:30.370 --> 14:31.838
It's just that...
Becky, why in the hell

14:31.871 --> 14:33.340
has my hair and makeup
budget been cut?

14:33.373 --> 14:35.508
Take a number, sweetheart.
My budget got cut, too.

14:35.542 --> 14:38.211
Um, your budget got cut
because Andre curved your ass.

14:38.245 --> 14:40.580
Do I need to toss you
off another stage?

14:40.613 --> 14:41.915
Oh, my God.
TIANA: Oh.

14:41.949 --> 14:43.283
You want to try again?
I didn't come here to fight.

14:43.316 --> 14:44.384
Can we please not do this?

14:44.417 --> 14:45.418
I just don't-- Hey! Hey!

14:45.452 --> 14:46.954
Hey, ladies, ladies!

14:46.987 --> 14:49.622
Please do not go all
"Ten Duel Commandments" in here.

14:49.656 --> 14:52.359
Okay, everybody
got their budget cut.

14:52.392 --> 14:54.061
It's got nothing to do
with Hakeem,

14:54.094 --> 14:55.528
and it's got nothing to do

14:55.562 --> 14:56.696
with Andre, all right?

14:56.729 --> 14:58.365
Everything outside of
Lucious' Vegas show

14:58.398 --> 15:01.768
has been cut, including me
and my check, okay?

15:01.801 --> 15:02.769
We're all cut.

15:02.802 --> 15:04.571
Grasshopper.

15:04.604 --> 15:07.040
What do you say
we take care of some business?

15:07.074 --> 15:08.841
It's personal.

15:20.320 --> 15:22.055
Why are you doing that?

15:22.089 --> 15:23.823
No reason.

15:41.208 --> 15:43.643
Did you put glass in here?

15:43.676 --> 15:45.412
For Fatima's bastard.

15:45.445 --> 15:46.846
Did you put glass...

15:46.879 --> 15:49.149
He's not welcome in this house.

15:50.817 --> 15:53.120
(doorbell rings)

15:59.492 --> 16:00.860
(door opens)

16:00.893 --> 16:04.697
Mr. Cousins is here
for lunch with Mr. Lyon.

16:04.731 --> 16:05.898
Miss Leah.

16:08.501 --> 16:12.372
Look, um, lunch is gonna be
a little bit delayed.

16:12.405 --> 16:16.309
We had a little trouble
with the kitchen.

16:18.978 --> 16:21.914
Why am I here, and how
the hell did you find me?

16:24.384 --> 16:27.120
I mean, typically,
a man in my position

16:27.154 --> 16:30.290
can find just about anybody
that they're looking for,

16:30.323 --> 16:31.924
if they're important
enough to him.

16:35.262 --> 16:40.200
I mean, that's always
been my experience.

16:40.233 --> 16:42.569
But I've searched
high and low

16:42.602 --> 16:47.240
to find this one person,
and I keep coming up empty.

16:49.242 --> 16:54.013
As you may
or may not know...

16:54.047 --> 16:59.386
Child Protective Services
illegally entered my home

16:59.419 --> 17:01.221
and took my grandchild

17:01.254 --> 17:06.259
on trumped-up allegations
of child endangerment.

17:06.293 --> 17:11.098
Now, apparently she's been lost
in this matrix of paperwork

17:11.131 --> 17:13.032
that they call a system.

17:13.066 --> 17:18.071
And I'm asking you to use
all of your expertise

17:18.105 --> 17:21.674
as an FBI agent...

17:21.708 --> 17:23.876
to find my grandchild.

17:26.413 --> 17:29.582
I will give you
whatever you want.

17:38.125 --> 17:39.726
All right, the key to taking
Giuliana down is her ledgers,

17:39.759 --> 17:42.028
which she keeps in a wall
safe inside her office.

17:42.061 --> 17:44.564
There's only one way in
and one way out.

17:44.597 --> 17:46.133
And me and Cookie
are both banned.

17:46.166 --> 17:47.434
CANDACE:
So we're going to

17:47.467 --> 17:49.436
sneak inside a casino
and crack a safe?

17:49.469 --> 17:50.870
THIRSTY: Look, I know it
sounds a little Hollywood,

17:50.903 --> 17:52.639
but, uh, Cookie
has faith in you,

17:52.672 --> 17:54.274
and I believe in being prepared.

17:54.307 --> 17:55.742
Now, we're not talking
about the whole casino;

17:55.775 --> 17:57.043
we're just talking
about the VIP room,

17:57.076 --> 17:58.645
where high rollers
do their thing.
Oh.

17:58.678 --> 18:00.780
Now, there's a security
guard blocking that door.

18:00.813 --> 18:02.982
Carol, you're gonna
distract him by using

18:03.015 --> 18:05.552
whatever means necessary.
You cool with that?

18:05.585 --> 18:08.588
Oh, baby, I'm cool with that.
Me and my means...

18:08.621 --> 18:09.822
are good to go.

18:09.856 --> 18:10.823
BECKY:
(chuckles) Yes, honey.

18:10.857 --> 18:13.493
Okay, now, Candace,

18:13.526 --> 18:15.628
you and hubby will get
Giuliana out that door

18:15.662 --> 18:17.597
by Kevin here posing
as a high roller.

18:17.630 --> 18:20.600
Blackjack is my middle name.
Right, babe?

18:20.633 --> 18:21.801
That's right, baby.

18:21.834 --> 18:23.636
THIRSTY:
Okey-dokey. Now,

18:23.670 --> 18:24.904
behind this door,
there's a hallway

18:24.937 --> 18:26.606
that leads to the vault
in one direction

18:26.639 --> 18:28.007
and Giuliana's
office in the other.

18:28.040 --> 18:29.909
Now, the door can
only be opened by using

18:29.942 --> 18:31.978
a four-digit security code
that gets changed daily.

18:32.011 --> 18:34.314
We get the number, and that
gets us to the safecracking.

18:34.347 --> 18:35.848
(whistles)

18:35.882 --> 18:38.017
Marvin, roll it in.

18:40.153 --> 18:41.788
Wow.

18:41.821 --> 18:43.490
THIRSTY:
Yeah.

18:44.557 --> 18:46.859
You got to think
of this safe as

18:46.893 --> 18:49.095
a piggy bank
on steroids.

18:49.128 --> 18:50.630
It's not that deep.

18:50.663 --> 18:51.964
So who's gonna crack that?

18:58.137 --> 19:01.208
Uh, I'm not a safecra... Look,
I'm not gonna crack a safe.

19:01.241 --> 19:04.043
I'll do it. I used to boost
department stores a lot.

19:04.076 --> 19:05.011
No, ma'am.

19:05.044 --> 19:07.046
Can you back your ass up?

19:09.316 --> 19:10.850
You have the chill
disposition we need,

19:10.883 --> 19:13.019
so you will
crack the safe, Becky.

19:14.221 --> 19:15.922
(knuckles crack)

19:21.894 --> 19:23.129
(door opens)

19:23.162 --> 19:24.697
(man grunts)

19:29.068 --> 19:31.238
(grunts)

19:31.271 --> 19:33.873
Only reason I'm doing this
is because of a helpless,

19:33.906 --> 19:37.009
blameless little girl who
happens to be my blood.

19:37.043 --> 19:39.178
Didn't do anything to
deserve getting caught up

19:39.212 --> 19:41.981
in this ugliness
you perpetuate.

19:42.014 --> 19:43.983
This is Sam.

19:44.016 --> 19:45.585
Sam, this is Lucious.

19:45.618 --> 19:47.387
He needs your help
with something.

19:49.456 --> 19:51.424
Hello, Sam.

19:51.458 --> 19:53.226
It's nice to meet you.

19:56.128 --> 19:59.499
I'm told that, um...

19:59.532 --> 20:02.369
you might have been
contacted by somebody

20:02.402 --> 20:05.238
to forge some documents.

20:06.706 --> 20:08.775
Documents for...

20:10.777 --> 20:12.945
...my granddaughter?

20:12.979 --> 20:15.382
I've never seen that kid
in my life.

20:15.415 --> 20:18.618
And even if I had,
I don't dime on paying clients.

20:20.152 --> 20:22.722
He don't dime
on paying clients.

20:26.058 --> 20:27.460
(groaning)

20:34.901 --> 20:36.536
Okay, just take your time,
all right?

20:36.569 --> 20:39.071
Relax your shoulders,
breathe through it.

20:41.508 --> 20:43.276
CAROL: So, these are cameras?
CANDACE: Yeah, just try one.

20:43.310 --> 20:45.211
Okay.
Look there.
She'll show you.

20:45.244 --> 20:48.080
THIRSTY: Don't listen for
the click. Feel the click.

20:48.114 --> 20:50.750
Oh, shut up, shut up.
I almost got it. I got it.

20:50.783 --> 20:52.485
Damn!

20:52.519 --> 20:53.486
I just...

20:53.520 --> 20:54.654
I don't know
about this, Cookie.

20:54.687 --> 20:55.988
Maybe we should
just call this off.

20:56.022 --> 20:57.890
No, no, we are not
calling this off.

20:57.924 --> 21:00.593
I haven't seen my Kevin
this excited since...

21:00.627 --> 21:03.062
Uh, I don't need to know
what gets Kevin excited, okay?

21:03.095 --> 21:04.096
KEVIN:
Blackjack!

21:04.130 --> 21:05.898
Honey, I got a blackjack.

21:05.932 --> 21:07.400
Okay, Kevin, we get it
that you like black.

21:07.434 --> 21:08.468
THIRSTY:
Becky, look at this.

21:08.501 --> 21:09.736
It's just me and you, okay?

21:09.769 --> 21:12.305
Focus.
Be confident.

21:12.339 --> 21:15.942
Put your hands on the
dial... and breathe.

21:15.975 --> 21:17.710
(Becky and Thirsty
breathing deeply)

21:20.713 --> 21:21.681
(grunts)

21:21.714 --> 21:23.115
TARIQ:
Who hired you?

21:23.149 --> 21:25.452
Look, I'm not a bad guy.

21:25.485 --> 21:27.186
You know, some
poor orphan kid

21:27.219 --> 21:28.521
needs a shot
at a decent life,

21:28.555 --> 21:30.022
I get 'em out of the system,

21:30.056 --> 21:32.124
so maybe they won't
become bottom-feeders.

21:32.158 --> 21:34.794
Bottom-feeders?

21:34.827 --> 21:37.196
Are you referring
to these innocent children

21:37.229 --> 21:39.165
that's got no choice
of where they are,

21:39.198 --> 21:42.001
thrown in a system--
you calling them bottom-feeders?

21:42.034 --> 21:44.203
People like me
and my brother?

21:44.236 --> 21:46.506
How do you feel
about that, brother?

21:46.539 --> 21:48.375
I don't like it
one bit, brother.

21:49.542 --> 21:50.510
How you feel about it?

21:50.543 --> 21:51.744
It hurts my feelings.

22:04.223 --> 22:07.059
(Sam groaning)

22:10.062 --> 22:11.664
That felt good.

22:11.698 --> 22:14.701
Sorry it took so long
for us to come together.

22:14.734 --> 22:16.803
(panting)

22:16.836 --> 22:20.306
I'm-a... go and
get to a meeting.

22:20.339 --> 22:23.009
Maybe you can get
some more out of him.

22:23.042 --> 22:24.811
Okay?

22:24.844 --> 22:26.613
(softly):
Yeah.

22:28.180 --> 22:30.550
I'm sorry it took us
this long to get here.

22:32.585 --> 22:34.487
(Sam groans)

22:34.521 --> 22:39.692
This is called
"open monitoring meditation."

22:39.726 --> 22:41.828
So don't focus on the safe.

22:41.861 --> 22:43.896
You focus on
everything that exists.

22:43.930 --> 22:45.565
Be aware of
every sound.

22:45.598 --> 22:46.833
Every sound.

22:46.866 --> 22:49.035
Every thought.
Every thought.

22:49.068 --> 22:51.504
Every memory-- let it
flow through you.

22:51.538 --> 22:53.540
Every memory's
flowing through me.

22:53.573 --> 22:55.207
You're not touching the lock,
you are the lock.

22:55.241 --> 22:56.409
The lock is you.

22:56.443 --> 22:57.444
You and the lock are one.

22:57.477 --> 22:59.378
I am the lock.

22:59.979 --> 23:01.280
(safe clanks)

23:01.313 --> 23:03.282
(sighs)
I am the lock.

23:03.315 --> 23:05.051
I...
Feel the click!

23:05.084 --> 23:06.719
...am the lock.
(safe clanks)

23:07.920 --> 23:09.422
I am the lock.

23:09.456 --> 23:10.723
I am the...

23:15.294 --> 23:17.263
(Cookie and Becky cheering)

23:17.296 --> 23:19.365
COOKIE: All right,
get up, bitches!

23:19.398 --> 23:20.533
Yes!
We are going to Vegas!

23:20.567 --> 23:21.868
Get up, bitches.

23:21.901 --> 23:24.136
Pack up your clothes.
I am the lock! I am the lock!

23:29.609 --> 23:31.377
* We can get low,
oh, nah, nah, nah *

23:31.410 --> 23:33.045
* We can get low, oh,
nah, nah, nah *

23:33.079 --> 23:35.582
* Let me be your friend,
baby, let me in *

23:35.615 --> 23:37.984
* Tell you no lies,
oh, nah, nah, nah *

23:38.017 --> 23:40.419
* We can get lost,
oh, nah, nah, nah *

23:40.453 --> 23:42.589
* Take it all off,
oh, nah, nah, nah *

23:42.622 --> 23:44.891
* Let me be your friend,
baby, let me in *

23:44.924 --> 23:46.659
* Give it to me all,
oh, nah, nah, nah... *

23:46.693 --> 23:48.661
CAROL:
Whoo!

23:48.695 --> 23:49.662
Vegas, baby, yes!

23:49.696 --> 23:51.263
This is my kind of town, guys.

23:51.297 --> 23:52.665
Hey, listen, uh,

23:52.699 --> 23:54.433
when we get done
this little gig we got to do,

23:54.467 --> 23:56.402
I need for y'all to
take me out on the town.

23:56.435 --> 23:57.937
Carol, shut your mouth.

23:57.970 --> 23:59.972
We just met these fools
in the lobby.

24:00.006 --> 24:01.307
(volume decreasing)
CAROL:
Hey, wait a minute.

24:01.340 --> 24:02.775
Why y'all turning
the music down?

24:02.809 --> 24:04.777
It's me. You can do
it from back here.

24:04.811 --> 24:07.514
(exhales slowly)
I'm kind of nervous.

24:07.547 --> 24:09.448
Keep your faith in our plan.

24:09.482 --> 24:11.417
Get it together before
we get with Cookie.
Okay.

24:11.450 --> 24:14.453
* I got the moves,
I got the moves *

24:14.487 --> 24:15.955
(volume increases):
* I'm making moves *

24:15.988 --> 24:18.157
* You gotta move *
* You gotta move *

24:18.190 --> 24:19.425
* She made that back move *

24:19.458 --> 24:21.293
* She made the ... move *

24:21.327 --> 24:23.129
* I make the city move *
* Like whoa *

24:23.162 --> 24:24.497
* I made the city move *

24:24.531 --> 24:25.965
* I got the moves *
* I'm making *

24:25.998 --> 24:27.433
* I got the moves *
* I got the moves... *

24:27.466 --> 24:29.969
WOMAN: Welcome to
Laviticus, Las Vegas.

24:30.002 --> 24:32.004
* You gotta *
* She made that back move *

24:32.038 --> 24:33.439
* She made the ... move *

24:33.472 --> 24:34.974
* I make the city move *
* I do *

24:35.007 --> 24:37.009
* I made the city move *
* I do *

24:37.043 --> 24:38.945
* Give me the ball
and I will have to pass it *
Yes!

24:38.978 --> 24:40.479
* I ain't passing out
till I'm asthma attacking *

24:40.513 --> 24:42.348
* I take a plan,
then I back to back it *

24:42.381 --> 24:43.883
* Hit after hit,
check the batting average *

24:43.916 --> 24:45.618
* I take the work,
flip it, acrobatic *

24:45.652 --> 24:46.953
* Got a little time
and a lot of talent *

24:46.986 --> 24:48.621
* Do a little talking
and a lot of action *

24:48.655 --> 24:50.489
* Seen the competition,
hmm, not a challenge *

24:50.523 --> 24:53.325
* I lean, I move,
I walk through in this... *

24:53.359 --> 24:55.061
* Packed out
but I can count on my hands *

24:55.094 --> 24:56.462
* Who I'm-a talk to
in this ... *

24:56.495 --> 24:57.697
* Girls from law school
in this ... *

24:57.730 --> 24:58.831
(tape rewinding)
* Yeah, they paralegals *

24:58.865 --> 25:00.733
* Barely 21, that's very legal *

25:00.767 --> 25:02.802
* But they doing ... that's
probably barely legal... *

25:02.835 --> 25:04.336
Welcome to
Laviticus Las Vegas.

25:04.370 --> 25:07.306
CAROL:
Damn, you look hot, Chicken.

25:07.339 --> 25:09.475
* From here on out,
it'll be consecutive... *

25:09.508 --> 25:11.310
Lucious and Giuliana?

25:11.343 --> 25:12.378
Upstairs in the club
having dinner

25:12.411 --> 25:14.146
with the Mormon boss lady.

25:14.180 --> 25:16.849
* For a minute, me, I make the
... that last for infinity *

25:16.883 --> 25:19.652
* Hop in the booth, man,
that ... like a gym to me *

25:19.686 --> 25:21.153
* Don't test the agility,
hit your ... *

25:21.187 --> 25:23.089
* From like way,
oh, ways away... *

25:23.122 --> 25:25.391
You know you can still let me
open the safe, right?

25:25.424 --> 25:27.493
Shut your stupid ass up
before you blow your cover.

25:27.526 --> 25:28.928
* I got the moves *
* I'm making *

25:28.961 --> 25:30.730
* I got the moves *
* I got the moves *

25:30.763 --> 25:32.364
* I'm making moves *
* I'm making moves *

25:32.398 --> 25:33.566
* You gotta move *
* You gotta *

25:33.600 --> 25:35.001
* She make that back move *

25:35.034 --> 25:36.903
* She made the ... move *

25:36.936 --> 25:38.571
* I make the city move *
* I do *

25:38.605 --> 25:40.506
* I made the city move *
* I do... *

25:40.539 --> 25:42.274
KEVIN: Lady luck
is with me tonight!

25:42.308 --> 25:43.375
Bring it on.

25:43.409 --> 25:45.077
Honey, are you
still going at it?

25:45.111 --> 25:47.379
We got to go.
Oh, my dear, I'm ahead.

25:47.413 --> 25:49.248
If you want some
of this behind,

25:49.281 --> 25:50.583
you better scale up.

25:50.617 --> 25:53.152
* Any of the above,
now you harder to find. *

25:54.621 --> 25:58.357
A first-class casino
would've comped us a room

25:58.390 --> 26:01.694
and had these winnings
secure in a safe by now.

26:01.728 --> 26:03.462
KEVIN: Mm-hmm.
You know, just saying.

26:03.495 --> 26:05.097
Sir, madam.

26:05.131 --> 26:07.233
If you would like,
we could put your winnings

26:07.266 --> 26:08.400
in one of our vaults.
Oh.

26:08.434 --> 26:10.436
(crowd cheering)

26:15.808 --> 26:18.044
Get off of me!
I will shut this place down!

26:18.077 --> 26:19.578
Get your hands off of me!
My name is...!

26:19.612 --> 26:21.881
Seems a little
hectic here tonight.

26:21.914 --> 26:23.415
If you don't mind,

26:23.449 --> 26:25.785
I'd like to take a tour
of the vault first.

26:25.818 --> 26:27.887
One moment, sir.

26:27.920 --> 26:29.455
COOKIE:
You are canceled! Get off of me!

26:33.125 --> 26:35.261
Get off of me!

26:35.294 --> 26:37.229
Get off of me.

26:37.263 --> 26:39.766
Okay, all right, okay!
Keep your hands to yourself!

26:39.799 --> 26:43.002
High-roller on table four
would like a tour of the vaults.

26:43.035 --> 26:45.271
Meet me at the
east security door,

26:45.304 --> 26:47.573
and make sure Cookie is
out of this building.

26:47.606 --> 26:48.975
Yes, ma'am.

26:49.008 --> 26:50.677
COOKIE: I will end
your career, bitch!

26:50.710 --> 26:52.144
Get off of me.
I can walk.

26:53.846 --> 26:58.484
* Oh, oh, oh, oh *

26:58.517 --> 27:01.821
* Hey, hey, hey, hey... *

27:01.854 --> 27:04.356
Lucious.
Is everything okay?

27:04.390 --> 27:06.125
Everything's absolutely fine.

27:06.158 --> 27:09.428
Look, I know you've got
concerns about Inferno's crowd,

27:09.461 --> 27:11.931
but I assure you, you'll be
able to bring your husband

27:11.964 --> 27:13.465
and your kids to this place.

27:13.499 --> 27:15.768
ANDRE: My father is a man
of his word, Ms. Frost.

27:15.802 --> 27:17.303
I can assure you.

27:18.705 --> 27:19.739
It's Mrs. Frost.

27:21.007 --> 27:23.042
ANDRE:
Oh. I'm Andre Lyon.

27:23.075 --> 27:24.443
We haven't properly met,

27:24.476 --> 27:27.714
but I've heard
wonderful things about you.

27:27.747 --> 27:29.315
LUCIOUS: I'm quite
surprised that you're here.

27:29.348 --> 27:32.184
You know I just had
your mother thrown out.

27:32.218 --> 27:33.452
Are you next?

27:33.485 --> 27:36.555
Actually, I came by to warn you.

27:36.588 --> 27:39.458
Unfortunately,
I was too late.

27:39.491 --> 27:41.560
So, I'm Empire's CFO.

27:41.593 --> 27:44.030
If I can be of service
to you in any way,

27:44.063 --> 27:45.865
please do not hesitate,
let me know.

27:45.898 --> 27:47.366
Thank you. Andre?

27:47.399 --> 27:48.667
That's right.
Andre.

27:48.701 --> 27:51.037
Very kind of you.

27:51.070 --> 27:53.439
(chuckles)

28:01.080 --> 28:04.717
Did you see that bitch
smirking down at me?

28:04.751 --> 28:07.854
I should've threw my heel
right at her neck.

28:07.887 --> 28:09.555
I did good, though,
didn't I?
Yeah.

28:09.588 --> 28:11.758
Gave a little, little
Kill Bill meets Casino,

28:11.791 --> 28:13.392
with the ass of Foxy Brown
left up on there.

28:13.425 --> 28:14.927
Uh, don't be looking at my ass.

28:14.961 --> 28:16.095
No, I'm just--

28:16.128 --> 28:17.563
Okay, look, they're headed
to the security door.

28:17.596 --> 28:20.699
GIULIANA: Your winnings are
totally secure, Mr. Mason.

28:20.733 --> 28:23.369
All of our security
are ex-military.

28:23.402 --> 28:24.370
Oh.

28:24.403 --> 28:26.873
That's nice to know.

28:28.307 --> 28:30.676
Oh. How grotesque.

28:30.709 --> 28:31.911
Just sit your little
debutante ass down

28:31.944 --> 28:32.912
right here, please.
Thank you.

28:32.945 --> 28:34.613
Whatever. Which
screen is which?

28:34.646 --> 28:36.182
All right, this is
Carol, that's Becky,

28:36.215 --> 28:37.716
and there goes your
little hubby right there.

28:37.750 --> 28:39.852
GIULIANA: We like to
take extra special care

28:39.886 --> 28:40.953
of our high-rollers,
like yourself.

28:40.987 --> 28:42.789
How can I speak to him?
Grab the mic.

28:42.822 --> 28:44.023
KEVIN:
Ooh, I can see that.

28:44.056 --> 28:45.091
Eyes up, Kevin.

28:45.124 --> 28:47.059
Mama's watching.

28:48.227 --> 28:50.429
She too old to be showing
that much cleavage.

28:50.462 --> 28:51.764
(chuckles)
THIRSTY:
I got to beg to differ.

28:51.798 --> 28:53.399
Those are nice.
COOKIE:
Yeah, you would.

28:53.432 --> 28:55.534
You like them big
and fake, don't you?

28:55.567 --> 28:57.069
GIULIANA: The vault itself
is state-of-the-art.

28:57.103 --> 28:59.538
Well, as long as
it's secure.

28:59.571 --> 29:01.607
Do I look like the type
of girl you can't trust?

29:01.640 --> 29:02.641
(chuckles)

29:04.676 --> 29:06.212
THIRSTY:
All right, listen up, y'all.

29:06.245 --> 29:08.647
Code is: six, six,

29:08.680 --> 29:10.049
four, nine.

29:10.082 --> 29:11.417
Becky, you got that?

29:11.450 --> 29:13.719
Six, six, four, nine.

29:13.752 --> 29:15.955
(sighs) I'm on it.

29:15.988 --> 29:17.256
Right this way.

29:19.591 --> 29:21.660
THIRSTY: Give them time
to get to the vault.

29:21.693 --> 29:23.796
All right, Carol, it's
your turn. Strangé time.

29:23.830 --> 29:26.565
That's the guy.
He's your target.

29:26.598 --> 29:27.766
Go do your thing.

29:27.800 --> 29:30.002
(sighs)

29:34.040 --> 29:35.507
CAROL:
Hey, baby.

29:35.541 --> 29:37.776
You know, a girl
really feels safe

29:37.810 --> 29:39.411
with a big strapping
brother like yourself

29:39.445 --> 29:40.779
keeping an eye on things.

29:43.282 --> 29:45.117
Damn, my sister is a ho.

29:45.151 --> 29:47.319
Mm. Thank God.
GUARD: If you're soliciting,

29:47.353 --> 29:48.988
I will call the police.
Move along.

29:49.021 --> 29:52.324
CAROL: (chuckles)
Honey, I'm not a working girl.

29:52.358 --> 29:54.193
But you know I can
work it, right?

29:54.226 --> 29:56.362
You don't want to come
get a drink with me?

29:56.395 --> 29:57.429
Ma'am, move away
from the door.

29:57.463 --> 29:59.932
Uh... (laughs) wait a minute.

29:59.966 --> 30:01.600
You ain't got to
call me "ma'am."

30:01.633 --> 30:03.269
I'm probably younger
than your big ass.

30:03.302 --> 30:04.971
He's not going for it.
I know.

30:05.004 --> 30:06.205
GUARD:
This is your final warning.

30:06.238 --> 30:07.239
Step aside.

30:09.508 --> 30:11.077
(quietly):
Ain't that a bitch.

30:12.511 --> 30:13.645
All right, you
know what, y'all?

30:13.679 --> 30:15.014
I'm about to
go to the bar

30:15.047 --> 30:16.715
while y'all figure
this out, okay?

30:16.748 --> 30:18.784
Hell no!
Okay, let me think,
let me think for a minute.

30:18.817 --> 30:21.787
Hurry up. My man can't be
entertaining Giuliana all night.

30:21.820 --> 30:25.324
BECKY:
Oh, we're screwed.

30:25.357 --> 30:27.559
How am I supposed to get
past him? He's not gonna budge.

30:31.063 --> 30:33.132
Hold on, I think this freak
is into Becky.
What?
Oh.

30:33.165 --> 30:34.800
Hey, Becky, I think
this dude is into you.

30:34.833 --> 30:36.335
G-Go get your flirt on.

30:42.274 --> 30:44.576
I am not trained for that.

30:44.610 --> 30:46.478
Look, I can tell by the way
he stands, he's in the military.

30:46.512 --> 30:48.214
All right? So just talk to him
about military stuff.

30:48.247 --> 30:50.182
And shake your ass, see if
we can get him to "Oohrah."

30:50.216 --> 30:52.151
All right, so,
while she's shaking her ass

30:52.184 --> 30:53.652
and getting him to "Oohrah,"

30:53.685 --> 30:55.287
who's gonna
crack the safe, stupid?

31:01.360 --> 31:02.995
Carol.
COOKIE and CANDACE:
Carol?!

31:03.029 --> 31:03.996
What?! Me?

31:04.030 --> 31:05.564
What we got. It's what we got!
Her?!

31:05.597 --> 31:08.600
Ooh, Negro, I know
that's not your plan.
My...

31:08.634 --> 31:10.036
To get the flightiest,
flakiest one on the yard

31:10.069 --> 31:11.370
to crack the damn safe?
CANDACE: Really?

31:11.403 --> 31:12.771
Look, I could've got
my team together,

31:12.804 --> 31:14.340
but you're the one
that wanted to have

31:14.373 --> 31:16.075
this little sisterhood of
the traveling attitude

31:16.108 --> 31:18.210
on the road, so let's
just deal with what we got!
You know,

31:18.244 --> 31:20.112
cut it out with the $10 jokes,
looking like a sherbet pop.

31:20.146 --> 31:21.080
Sit down!

31:21.113 --> 31:22.548
Can we just deal
with what we got?

31:22.581 --> 31:24.116
Sit. Sit!
Could you just
speak English?

31:24.150 --> 31:25.717
This is exactly
why I went Asian.

31:32.258 --> 31:35.094
Let me guess. Navy?

31:35.127 --> 31:36.395
Nope.

31:36.428 --> 31:37.964
BECKY:
Hmm.

31:37.997 --> 31:39.198
Coast Guard?

31:39.231 --> 31:41.067
Nope.

31:41.100 --> 31:43.035
Army.

31:43.069 --> 31:45.071
That's right.
Army Ranger.

31:45.104 --> 31:46.638
BECKY:
Oh, you're a paratrooper.

31:46.672 --> 31:48.274
Hi.

31:48.307 --> 31:50.309
All right, go, go, go, now.
Six, six, four, nine.

31:50.342 --> 31:52.211
BECKY: Nice to meet you.
GUARD: Pleasure.

31:52.244 --> 31:54.280
BECKY: Oh, my God,
you're so much taller

31:54.313 --> 31:55.914
when you get close
to me like that.

31:55.948 --> 31:57.616
(Becky giggles)

31:57.649 --> 31:59.618
GUARD: How have you
been all night?
BECKY: I'm good.

31:59.651 --> 32:01.887
Oh, you guys, I cannot do this.

32:01.920 --> 32:03.055
Carol, you can
and you will.

32:03.089 --> 32:05.624
Just get in there and do it!

32:05.657 --> 32:06.758
GUARD:
I'll be out of here soon.

32:06.792 --> 32:08.260
BECKY:
Oh, soon? How soon?

32:08.294 --> 32:09.561
I'm almost done, too.

32:09.595 --> 32:10.662
(keypad beeping)
GUARD: Yeah?

32:10.696 --> 32:12.131
BECKY: Yeah.
GUARD: What time?

32:12.164 --> 32:13.165
THIRSTY:
All right, you're in.

32:13.199 --> 32:14.933
BECKY: Whenever you're off,
I'm off.

32:14.967 --> 32:16.735
(giggles):
Oh, my God.

32:16.768 --> 32:18.170
I'm so bad.

32:18.204 --> 32:19.205
(giggles)

32:22.308 --> 32:25.777
THIRSTY: Okay, walk into
the room on your left.

32:25.811 --> 32:28.447
That should be
Giuliana's office.

32:30.516 --> 32:32.318
Look for the painting
behind the desk.

32:37.623 --> 32:38.957
Good. There you go.

32:38.991 --> 32:40.526
The safe should be
behind the painting.

32:43.962 --> 32:46.965
Come on, Carol honey,
we don't have a lot of time.

32:46.999 --> 32:49.301
You can do it.

32:49.335 --> 32:50.536
Bingo.

32:50.569 --> 32:52.171
CAROL:
All right, you guys,

32:52.204 --> 32:53.939
listen, I can't do this;
my hands are shaking too much.

32:53.972 --> 32:55.641
Oh.
Okay, all right.

32:55.674 --> 32:57.543
Carol, yes you can
and yes you will.

32:57.576 --> 32:59.645
I will come in and beat...
(Candace whispers angrily)

32:59.678 --> 33:01.680
Carol?
Carol, you got this.

33:01.713 --> 33:05.184
Trying to act like
you a damsel in distress

33:05.217 --> 33:07.053
when I know
you got nerves of steel.

33:07.086 --> 33:08.820
I'm telling you,
I don't trust me.

33:08.854 --> 33:10.022
COOKIE:
Oh, my God.

33:10.056 --> 33:11.957
Okay. All right.

33:11.990 --> 33:13.659
(exhales)

33:13.692 --> 33:15.061
Okay, okay, okay.
(sniffles)

33:15.094 --> 33:16.728
All right. I got it.

33:21.200 --> 33:22.668
Carol?

33:22.701 --> 33:24.770
You got this, girl.

33:26.405 --> 33:29.041
Look, I know
I give you flak a lot.

33:29.075 --> 33:31.143
But you made of steel, girl.

33:31.177 --> 33:32.544
You got this.

33:42.088 --> 33:44.390
Okay, Thirsty,

33:44.423 --> 33:46.858
but you gonna have to
Mr. Miyagi my ass through this.

33:48.560 --> 33:50.028
THIRSTY:
Okay, okay, we got you now.

33:50.062 --> 33:51.197
Okay?

33:51.230 --> 33:53.765
All you got to do is breathe.

33:53.799 --> 33:56.368
(breathes deeply)

34:02.040 --> 34:03.175
THIRSTY:
Carol? Carol, are you there?

34:03.209 --> 34:05.111
Still nothing?
Nothing.

34:05.144 --> 34:07.113
(sighs)

34:08.814 --> 34:10.249
And nobody saw her.

34:11.583 --> 34:12.684
(door opens)

34:12.718 --> 34:14.620
COOKIE: Carol.
CANDACE: Oh, my God.

34:14.653 --> 34:16.054
COOKIE:
We lost video feed.

34:16.088 --> 34:17.356
I thought something
happened to you.

34:17.389 --> 34:18.857
What happened?

34:18.890 --> 34:19.925
We were scared you got caught.

34:19.958 --> 34:21.293
What?

34:21.327 --> 34:22.861
Bam!

34:22.894 --> 34:24.896
(whooping, laughter)

34:26.632 --> 34:28.434
Is that what we need?

34:28.467 --> 34:30.202
Yeah, the gaming commissioner
gets one look at these,

34:30.236 --> 34:31.703
it's multiple indictments
for sure.

34:31.737 --> 34:33.305
Yes, ding dong,

34:33.339 --> 34:34.373
the bitch is dead!

34:34.406 --> 34:36.041
Yes, baby!
I knew you could do it.

34:36.074 --> 34:37.876
CAROL: Told you,
I did it! Yeah, y'all.

34:37.909 --> 34:39.211
You know
I'm a safecracker, right?

34:39.245 --> 34:41.247
I'm a safecracker,
right?

34:41.280 --> 34:43.449
We know you like crack,
but we ain't gonna get into it.

34:43.482 --> 34:44.850
CAROL:
Hey, Cookie!
(laughs)

34:47.486 --> 34:49.488
Fraudulent reporting,
money laundering,

34:49.521 --> 34:51.290
consorting with criminals?

34:51.323 --> 34:53.292
This is really bad.

34:55.194 --> 34:57.229
You have seven kids?

34:57.263 --> 34:58.464
Damn.

34:58.497 --> 34:59.665
I mean... (chuckles)

34:59.698 --> 35:01.633
They must be proud
of their mother.

35:01.667 --> 35:03.269
Well, I hope
they're proud of me someday.

35:03.302 --> 35:05.003
Right now, they hate
how hard I work

35:05.036 --> 35:07.173
and wonder why
I can't be with them at home.

35:07.206 --> 35:08.807
Yeah, I understand that.

35:08.840 --> 35:11.410
Mine are grown, but they will
always need their mama.

35:11.443 --> 35:12.611
Especially...

35:12.644 --> 35:14.580
LUCIOUS:
Hakeem?

35:14.613 --> 35:17.316
Frankly, I'm a bit disturbed
to see that you've left him

35:17.349 --> 35:18.650
at a time of need.

35:20.386 --> 35:22.421
You see, our youngest
is going through

35:22.454 --> 35:24.923
a bit of a rough
time right now.

35:24.956 --> 35:28.194
Fortunately, I've been
able to handle a few things

35:28.227 --> 35:30.196
while his mother
has been here

35:30.229 --> 35:33.699
in Vegas, running
around like a banshee.

35:33.732 --> 35:37.269
Your last little stunt cost
us a half a million dollars.

35:37.303 --> 35:39.037
But it's worth it
if it means I can

35:39.070 --> 35:40.071
get my gaming license.

35:43.642 --> 35:45.344
So what are we
calling this one?

35:45.377 --> 35:47.379
"Charitable donation"?

35:47.413 --> 35:48.780
I don't care
what you call it.

35:48.814 --> 35:51.016
But after reading these,
the price might go up.

35:51.049 --> 35:53.285
I didn't know
Mormons took payoffs.

35:53.319 --> 35:56.322
Wow. You people really are
prone to stereotypes.

35:57.356 --> 35:58.524
Come on.
Now, if you'll excuse me,

35:58.557 --> 35:59.958
I have a lot of work to do.

35:59.991 --> 36:01.026
"You people."

36:01.059 --> 36:03.128
It's okay,
come on. Please.

36:03.161 --> 36:04.230
Cookie, let's go.

36:04.263 --> 36:05.531
Come on, you're
gonna cost us

36:05.564 --> 36:06.765
some more money.

36:09.768 --> 36:11.370
(mutters)

36:11.403 --> 36:13.171
(sighs)

36:16.041 --> 36:17.676
(sighs)

36:19.678 --> 36:23.014
Wow. You have
an interesting family.

36:23.048 --> 36:26.852
"Interesting" isn't the word
I would've chosen.

36:28.787 --> 36:30.656
Well, then.

36:30.689 --> 36:34.125
I guess you're gonna have
to help me find better words.

36:36.127 --> 36:37.429
I'll get to
work on that.

36:37.463 --> 36:39.998
(chuckles)

36:40.031 --> 36:41.800
(laughs softly)

37:05.156 --> 37:07.192
COOKIE: You talked
to your father, right?

37:07.225 --> 37:09.695
He said he expecting to know
where she is today or tomorrow.

37:09.728 --> 37:11.863
Yeah, I trust him on that.

37:11.897 --> 37:14.132
It's the one thing
I do trust him on.

37:14.165 --> 37:15.567
You can trust him, too.

37:15.601 --> 37:17.102
Who I shouldn't
have trusted

37:17.135 --> 37:20.972
is that... shady-ass Mormon.

37:21.006 --> 37:22.974
It's my own damn fault.

37:23.008 --> 37:26.312
So, what, she a Mormon,
you expect her not to be shady?

37:26.345 --> 37:27.245
Ma, you just gonna
have to

37:27.279 --> 37:29.281
dust yourself off
and get back to work.

37:29.315 --> 37:30.549
That's exactly
what I'm gonna do.

37:30.582 --> 37:32.451
Now, sit down,
so you can listen to my plan.

37:32.484 --> 37:33.752
Wait.
No, no, no.

37:33.785 --> 37:35.387
I got to tell you...
Sit down, boy, listen.

37:35.421 --> 37:37.723
Now, y'all remember
old Byron What's-His-Ass

37:37.756 --> 37:40.792
said we would never be able
to go head-to-head with Inferno.

37:40.826 --> 37:42.728
Well, I want to take
them all by surprise

37:42.761 --> 37:44.229
and get out there tonight.

37:44.262 --> 37:45.631
Tonight. Mom...

37:45.664 --> 37:47.833
Look, Coocious, the promo,
still getting, like,

37:47.866 --> 37:50.402
10,000 new streams a day.

37:50.436 --> 37:52.438
Hmm. When Lucious wakes
up tomorrow morning,

37:52.471 --> 37:54.440
I want the press
to be all about

37:54.473 --> 37:57.443
how Inferno can't top
When Cookie Met Lucious.

37:57.476 --> 37:59.110
(chuckles)

37:59.144 --> 38:01.913
And I want y'all to get out
on that stage, together,

38:01.947 --> 38:03.649
and do a-a APB shout-out.

38:03.682 --> 38:05.116
So people can look for Bella.

38:05.150 --> 38:06.485
In front of all those
millions of people.

38:06.518 --> 38:08.119
That's a great idea,
right? Come on.

38:08.153 --> 38:09.855
It's a beautiful idea, Ma,
it really is.
I know it is.

38:09.888 --> 38:10.956
JAMAL:
But listen.

38:10.989 --> 38:12.123
I made a decision, okay?

38:12.157 --> 38:13.325
(footsteps approaching)

38:13.359 --> 38:15.427
Uh, what is
he doing here?

38:15.461 --> 38:16.695
Am I interrupting
something?

38:16.728 --> 38:18.697
You're always
interrupting something.

38:18.730 --> 38:20.366
And what you make
a decision about?

38:20.399 --> 38:24.002
I decided to hold off
on the release

38:24.035 --> 38:25.971
of When Cookie Met Lucious
until after Inferno.

38:26.004 --> 38:27.673
Why?

38:29.207 --> 38:32.411
'Cause I'm gonna
join Dad's show in Vegas.

38:43.321 --> 38:44.690
Ma, come on, it's a good thing.
It's good for all of us.

38:44.723 --> 38:46.625
You know what I'm saying? It'll
get everybody really hype.

38:46.658 --> 38:47.959
Is that what
your father's telling you?

38:47.993 --> 38:49.194
LUCIOUS: What, you think
I'm lying to him?

38:49.227 --> 38:52.063
He doesn't care about you, boy,
he just wants to win.

38:52.097 --> 38:55.567
No, I want us all to win.
That's the whole point of this.

38:55.601 --> 38:57.202
The stuff that he's
saying on this album,

38:57.235 --> 38:59.237
I mean, the things
that he's saying to me,

38:59.270 --> 39:01.339
I'm finally hearing him, and
it's something that I think

39:01.373 --> 39:02.541
the critics and that his fans,

39:02.574 --> 39:04.342
if they got a chance
to hear it...

39:04.376 --> 39:07.212
Oh, shut up.
But they won't get a chance
to listen to what I've heard

39:07.245 --> 39:09.381
if all they're hearing
is noise from Inferno.

39:09.415 --> 39:11.483
Mom, come on. This is
what I've been waiting--

39:11.517 --> 39:14.853
this is what both of us
have been waiting for.

39:14.886 --> 39:16.555
You know, he's
actually hearing us.

39:16.588 --> 39:19.891
You know you can't trust him.
You know you can't trust him.

39:19.925 --> 39:21.192
Ma, how you gonna say
don't trust him?

39:21.226 --> 39:22.828
When you just told me
to trust him about Bella.

39:22.861 --> 39:24.195
Boy...
JAMAL: Yeah.

39:24.229 --> 39:25.864
HAKEEM: How can I trust him
about my own daughter?

39:25.897 --> 39:26.998
JAMAL: And that's a baby.
Like, that's ten times

39:27.032 --> 39:28.266
more important
than our stupid record.

39:28.299 --> 39:29.601
LUCIOUS: Wait, wait, wait,
stop, stop, stop, stop.

39:29.635 --> 39:31.870
Y'all just ganging up
on her right now.

39:31.903 --> 39:34.740
She's having a hard time; maybe
she just needs a few minutes

39:34.773 --> 39:36.074
to think things through.

39:37.809 --> 39:39.377
Give her some space.

39:42.781 --> 39:44.683
Mom, please. Come on,
don't be like that.

39:44.716 --> 39:46.284
Mom.
LUCIOUS:
Just let her go.

39:46.317 --> 39:48.420
She came for me hard,
had her feelings hurt.

39:48.454 --> 39:50.255
Maybe she just needs
to lick her wounds.

39:50.288 --> 39:52.157
(elevator bell dings)

39:55.326 --> 39:57.963
*

39:59.330 --> 40:01.332
(humming tune)

40:04.503 --> 40:06.505
Okay, here we go.

40:11.843 --> 40:13.579
Come on, my little Bella.

40:13.612 --> 40:16.114
(fusses)

40:16.147 --> 40:17.549
All right.

40:17.583 --> 40:19.451
(line rings)
WOMAN: Hello, Mrs. DuBois?

40:19.485 --> 40:21.419
We just finished our walk.
We're at the gate.

40:25.423 --> 40:27.125
(line ringing)

40:27.158 --> 40:29.561
LUCIOUS (over phone):
Lucious here.

40:29.595 --> 40:30.896
Leave a message.
(beep)

40:30.929 --> 40:32.330
Yo, it's Tariq.

40:32.363 --> 40:34.466
I found her. I'm on my way.

40:35.501 --> 40:37.035
(engine starts)

40:45.877 --> 40:46.945
Your father...

40:46.978 --> 40:48.614
ANDRE:
I heard.

40:48.647 --> 40:50.348
Vegas was a bust.

40:50.381 --> 40:53.752
I was just trying to
get Giuliana arrested.

40:53.785 --> 40:54.786
Don't give
up just yet.

40:54.820 --> 40:57.188
No. Dre, I-I'm done.

40:59.224 --> 41:01.092
That's a shame.

41:01.126 --> 41:02.628
'Cause I'm just getting started.

41:02.661 --> 41:04.630
Boy, it's over.

41:04.663 --> 41:07.465
Okay? And I'm-- I know
you heard that frosty bitch

41:07.499 --> 41:09.768
is all in your daddy's pocket.

41:09.801 --> 41:11.336
Charlotte may have taken
Pop's money,

41:11.369 --> 41:13.438
but she has no loyalty to him.

41:13.471 --> 41:15.340
How do you know
who she's loyal to?

41:15.373 --> 41:18.243
We've had our own
private conversations.

41:21.680 --> 41:23.048
Dre.

41:23.081 --> 41:24.716
I'm your mama.

41:24.750 --> 41:26.051
Boy, give me the 411.

41:26.084 --> 41:27.318
All right.

41:27.352 --> 41:29.120
(inhales)

41:29.154 --> 41:30.822
(clears throat)

41:30.856 --> 41:33.491
Charlotte doesn't have
a problem taking payoffs

41:33.525 --> 41:35.193
as long as she tithes
to her church.

41:35.226 --> 41:39.464
But... she is deadly serious

41:39.497 --> 41:42.033
about keeping
the thug element out of Vegas.

41:42.067 --> 41:44.636
Now, anything
jumps off,

41:44.670 --> 41:47.639
anything at all,

41:47.673 --> 41:49.675
she will snuff out Inferno

41:49.708 --> 41:52.310
before Pop can even
strike a match.

41:52.343 --> 41:54.045
Hmm.

41:54.079 --> 41:57.482
So she doesn't like thugs
running amok in her town.

41:57.515 --> 41:59.751
Well,

41:59.785 --> 42:03.021
we'll just have to give her
Biggie and Pac times ten.

42:06.625 --> 42:08.560
(glasses clink)

42:11.863 --> 42:13.832
LUCIOUS:
I owe you everything.

42:13.865 --> 42:16.334
You found my grandbaby.

42:16.367 --> 42:18.036
Please, don't keep me
in suspense.

42:18.069 --> 42:19.605
Oh, never that,
my brother.

42:19.638 --> 42:21.272
(chuckles)

42:21.306 --> 42:23.875
"Brother." Yo.

42:23.909 --> 42:26.077
A lot's gone down
between us, man.

42:26.111 --> 42:27.613
I never thought we'd get here.

42:27.646 --> 42:30.515
Neither did I.

42:30.548 --> 42:32.851
Yeah.

42:32.884 --> 42:36.254
You know,
once Bella comes back home,

42:36.287 --> 42:39.190
I think you and me,
we should really sit down

42:39.224 --> 42:42.527
and talk about how we can
look after each other,

42:42.560 --> 42:46.064
the way brothers are supposed
to, you know, as a family.

42:46.097 --> 42:47.265
Yeah.

42:47.298 --> 42:48.800
We should drink to that.

42:48.834 --> 42:51.069
You're not a Mormon, are you?

42:51.102 --> 42:52.437
(laughs):
No, brother.

42:54.640 --> 42:56.942
Yo, you gonna need
all the family you got.

42:56.975 --> 42:58.644
Wait till you find out

42:58.677 --> 43:00.646
where I found Bella.

43:03.682 --> 43:05.083
(gagging)

43:08.186 --> 43:09.821
What in the hell
is wrong with you?!

43:11.322 --> 43:13.591
(gasping)

43:13.625 --> 43:15.460
Tariq.

43:59.905 --> 44:00.972
Yeah.

Now here are a few more shows
to check out from Fox.

44:11.516 --> 44:14.085
Mommy has to go
out of town for work.

44:15.653 --> 44:17.288
Something
ain't right here.

44:17.322 --> 44:19.524
The department
is obviously corrupt.

44:19.557 --> 44:21.526
-I understand how you feel.
-No, you don't.

44:21.559 --> 44:24.362
My son is dead.

44:24.395 --> 44:26.464
-MAN:
You should go back to DC.
-(grunts)

44:26.497 --> 44:28.499
Their threats
don't faze me.

44:28.533 --> 44:30.702
This some sort
of game to you?

44:30.736 --> 44:33.004
ASHE: We're taking on
an entire sheriff's department.
