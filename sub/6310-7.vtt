00:00.001 --> 00:01.476
Previously on "Legends"...

00:01.511 --> 00:03.990
There is no room in this business for love.

00:04.025 --> 00:05.182
I won't leave her.

00:05.217 --> 00:06.386
One person...

00:06.421 --> 00:07.872
becomes many.

00:08.627 --> 00:09.652
Stop there.

00:09.687 --> 00:11.656
Doku asked me to deliver
message to general.

00:11.691 --> 00:13.274
- When?
- Tomorrow morning.

00:13.309 --> 00:15.177
He proposed on the Charles Bridge.

00:15.212 --> 00:17.073
It's not about charging
Dmitry with a crime.

00:17.108 --> 00:18.457
It's about leverage to flip him.

00:18.492 --> 00:21.936
I haven't heard from
him in almost 15 years.

00:22.562 --> 00:24.239
My God, Curtis.

00:24.274 --> 00:25.876
The computer, it's not where you said.

00:25.911 --> 00:28.282
We're going home. Chechnya.

00:30.572 --> 00:34.177
_

00:35.480 --> 00:37.093
Can we stop for petrol?

00:37.128 --> 00:38.649
I'm dying for the loo.

00:38.684 --> 00:39.504
We have petrol.

00:39.539 --> 00:42.120
- You can wait.
- Beslan.

00:42.153 --> 00:44.459
Respect. Mm?

Don't forget, men's room.

01:28.146 --> 01:29.294
Do you speak English?

01:36.675 --> 01:38.677
- What are you doing?
- I, uh...

01:38.710 --> 01:41.060
I was just, um...

01:41.206 --> 01:43.302
I wanted to call my mum.

01:43.337 --> 01:44.975
- Let her know I'm okay.
- Are you stupid?

01:45.010 --> 01:47.622
The police will be listening to her phone.

01:47.735 --> 01:49.680
You want to go to prison?

01:51.338 --> 01:53.073
Once you're in Chechnya,

01:53.108 --> 01:55.100
you're not my problem.

01:55.135 --> 01:56.694
Till then...

01:56.778 --> 01:58.377
stay next to me.

02:00.796 --> 02:02.231
You need to go?

02:02.561 --> 02:04.335
There it is.

02:22.672 --> 02:26.221
_

02:29.775 --> 02:31.234
Beslan driving?

02:31.269 --> 02:32.531
Could be.

02:32.564 --> 02:34.665
Passenger looks like a woman.

02:34.700 --> 02:36.178
Kate?

02:36.525 --> 02:38.094
I can't tell.

02:39.580 --> 02:41.417
She hasn't signaled.

02:42.263 --> 02:45.142
We haven't seen anyone in
the apartment except Tamir.

02:45.176 --> 02:47.246
They've moved her, right under our noses.

02:47.281 --> 02:48.973
Pure speculation.

02:49.008 --> 02:49.565
Beslan was the one

02:49.600 --> 02:51.340
who drove Kate from Paris.

02:51.375 --> 02:52.669
Maybe he did take her somewhere else.

02:52.704 --> 02:54.192
She has an emergency number.

02:54.227 --> 02:56.918
What if she can't get to a damn phone?

02:57.113 --> 02:58.455
We need to go in there, find out where

02:58.490 --> 02:59.318
they've taken her...

02:59.353 --> 03:00.934
And blow five months of surveillance?

03:00.969 --> 03:02.813
She's an 18-year-old
schoolgirl!

03:02.848 --> 03:05.796
Not a trained intelligence
officer, for God's sake.

03:05.831 --> 03:06.580
Listen,

03:06.615 --> 03:09.215
you lot forced her into this.

03:09.250 --> 03:09.989
I'm gonna get her out.

03:10.024 --> 03:11.978
Look, I'm running the show here.

03:12.013 --> 03:13.957
I'll decide who goes in and when.

03:13.992 --> 03:15.571
If you don't like it, I'll
be happy to phone the FBI...

03:15.606 --> 03:16.933
You're a shit.

03:16.968 --> 03:18.888
Take a break, Martin.

03:30.578 --> 03:31.363
Look, I know you're worried

03:31.398 --> 03:34.204
about Kate... so am I...
but you've got to play nice

03:34.239 --> 03:36.516
- with Simon.
- To hell with Simon.

03:38.061 --> 03:39.865
I know how to get her back...

03:40.168 --> 03:41.071
without compromising

03:41.106 --> 03:42.863
his bloody operation.

03:42.898 --> 03:44.032
How?

03:45.899 --> 03:48.057
I'll become Dmitry again.

03:53.875 --> 03:56.301
Sync and corrections by explosiveskull
www.addic7ed.com

03:57.181 --> 03:58.778
You're mad.

03:58.813 --> 03:59.952
You want the encryption key

03:59.987 --> 04:02.151
- from Tamir's computer, right?
- Yes.

04:02.186 --> 04:04.656
But how does you playing
dress-up help me get it?

04:04.736 --> 04:06.799
Dmitry and Tamir were close.

04:06.834 --> 04:08.727
I gain his trust, get in the apartment,

04:08.760 --> 04:09.967
download the computer.

04:10.002 --> 04:11.246
Come on. You don't give a shit

04:11.281 --> 04:12.354
about getting the intelligence.

04:12.389 --> 04:14.666
- This is just about Kate.
- What if it is?

04:14.808 --> 04:16.622
You both get what you want.

04:20.529 --> 04:22.284
So we rebuild the legend.

04:22.331 --> 04:23.132
Then what?

04:23.167 --> 04:25.973
We come up with a few scenarios
for initiating contact,

04:26.008 --> 04:27.187
decide what's most credible.

04:27.222 --> 04:29.553
That's it? Bat around a few ideas,

04:29.588 --> 04:30.915
see what we come up with?

04:30.950 --> 04:33.111
You have a better way
to get to the computer?

04:35.480 --> 04:37.133
How do you convince
Tamir you're his old chum

04:37.168 --> 04:39.269
when all you know about Dmitry
comes from a hundred pages

04:39.304 --> 04:40.891
of redacted files?

04:40.925 --> 04:42.957
Gabi Miskova knew Dmitry.

04:44.206 --> 04:46.347
She can get us the Czech police reports,

04:46.462 --> 04:47.832
brief Martin.

04:49.021 --> 04:52.325
I know someone who knows
him a hell of a lot better.

04:52.515 --> 04:54.109
Ilyana.

04:55.639 --> 04:57.513
<i>You can't even tell
me where you're going?</i>

04:57.548 --> 04:59.995
They wouldn't say. Just
that it's to do with Kate,

05:00.030 --> 05:01.910
- and I must leave tonight.
- They expect you to jump

05:01.945 --> 05:05.282
on a plane based on nothing more than that?

05:05.416 --> 05:06.937
The man said details were strictly

05:06.972 --> 05:08.573
"need to know."

05:09.315 --> 05:11.326
I'm not meant to speak to anyone about it.

05:11.425 --> 05:13.276
Even your bloody husband?

05:15.544 --> 05:17.428
This trip...

05:18.475 --> 05:21.032
is it about Dmitry somehow?

05:22.218 --> 05:24.478
It's about Kate. I told you.

05:25.994 --> 05:29.616
_

05:31.078 --> 05:35.131
_

05:35.618 --> 05:39.047
_

05:43.706 --> 05:45.347
_

05:47.695 --> 05:51.494
_

05:51.529 --> 05:55.834
I thought Russian is
language of your enemy.

05:55.970 --> 05:58.669
My mother spoke Russian.

05:58.971 --> 06:01.976
For me it is language of the heart.

06:04.099 --> 06:05.810
You want me to go now?

06:05.943 --> 06:07.979
I don't want you to go.

06:09.237 --> 06:12.108
But Doku will wonder where you are.

06:15.260 --> 06:17.904
What if he suspects?

06:18.155 --> 06:21.290
You only have to be brave a little longer.

06:23.381 --> 06:24.616
Mm.

06:32.207 --> 06:34.310
Petrovich.

06:36.181 --> 06:39.373
- Back for lap dance?
- Well, you've been getting

06:39.408 --> 06:41.918
more than lap dances, haven't you, Dmitry?

06:58.332 --> 07:00.059
So what?

07:00.160 --> 07:02.067
Sex is against law in Czech Republic?

07:02.102 --> 07:05.978
What do you think your pal Doku
Zakayev would do if he saw those?

07:08.040 --> 07:10.584
It would be death sentence for Ilyana.

07:10.670 --> 07:13.358
Are FBI assassins now?

07:19.169 --> 07:20.684
You won't show him.

07:20.972 --> 07:23.814
No, you don't know the first
thing about what I might do.

07:23.887 --> 07:25.789
We could protect Ilyana.

07:25.894 --> 07:27.802
But not you.

07:27.875 --> 07:30.458
Our people in Budapest
tell us that Viktor Luhanski

07:30.503 --> 07:33.018
is having a big meet there in three days.

07:33.053 --> 07:35.389
You're gonna help us take him down.

07:36.514 --> 07:38.884
Get yourself invited.

07:47.113 --> 07:48.714
<i>Bad enough that you shagged her,</i>

07:48.749 --> 07:50.783
but now you've been bloody caught.

07:50.818 --> 07:53.428
I mean, what have I always
told you? There's no room...

07:53.463 --> 07:56.587
For love in our business. I know.

07:57.233 --> 07:59.224
So what do you propose to do about it?

07:59.257 --> 08:01.688
Maybe you should tell
Ballard about the operation

08:01.723 --> 08:04.083
and get him off my back once and for all.

08:04.632 --> 08:06.731
He's a problem, Terrence.

08:06.940 --> 08:09.077
I'll talk to the bosses.

08:09.185 --> 08:10.856
Absolutely no.

08:10.974 --> 08:13.315
Tell him to keep his mouth shut,

08:13.350 --> 08:16.052
and his prick in his pants.

08:16.394 --> 08:20.297
So he should tell the FBI he's
willing to become an informant?

08:21.046 --> 08:24.093
If that's what he needs
to do to keep his cover,

08:24.378 --> 08:26.049
it's his own fault... but no one

08:26.084 --> 08:28.651
is to be informed he's an operative.

08:28.764 --> 08:32.654
Not the FBI and certainly not the Czechs.

08:34.523 --> 08:37.285
You are close to Arsanov now, no?

08:37.321 --> 08:37.928
I think it's just

08:37.962 --> 08:41.460
a matter of days until
Dmitry makes contact.

08:42.984 --> 08:46.563
_

08:53.720 --> 08:55.054
Martin?

08:55.612 --> 08:57.713
Say hi to Gabi Miskova.

09:00.859 --> 09:03.056
Hi, Gabi. Thank you for coming.

09:14.638 --> 09:16.535
My friend is dead...

09:16.606 --> 09:18.397
because of you.

09:22.337 --> 09:24.108
_

09:27.183 --> 09:29.448
<i>Where are you taking me?</i>

09:29.810 --> 09:31.384
Can't tell you.

09:31.626 --> 09:33.462
It's a surprise.

09:41.713 --> 09:43.626
Wait, this is a private drive.

09:43.661 --> 09:46.407
- Someone lives here.
- Yeah.

09:46.442 --> 09:48.073
Us.

09:48.145 --> 09:50.649
What?

09:53.239 --> 09:55.641
It's one of the old
schoolmaster's cottages.

09:55.674 --> 09:57.462
You got the job?

09:57.619 --> 09:59.404
Trial basis for the first year.

09:59.439 --> 10:01.816
That's brilliant!

10:01.851 --> 10:02.454
And you sure you're all right

10:02.489 --> 10:04.982
about turning down the government people?

10:05.745 --> 10:08.515
That job doesn't come with a house.

10:15.498 --> 10:17.406
Come and have a look.

10:23.699 --> 10:25.972
Perfect for a nursery, right?

10:35.448 --> 10:37.449
Come see the view.

10:43.993 --> 10:46.760
- Like it?
- I love it.

10:49.348 --> 10:51.640
But isn't it a bit isolated?

10:51.722 --> 10:53.013
What do you mean?

10:53.048 --> 10:55.348
Just out here in the country.

10:55.411 --> 10:58.008
How are our friends gonna find us?

10:58.273 --> 11:00.873
I wouldn't mind if no one could find us.

11:00.939 --> 11:04.079
Sounds perfect, actually.

11:09.262 --> 11:12.927
_

11:28.667 --> 11:30.284
Shapa?

11:30.810 --> 11:32.618
How do you know my name?

11:32.653 --> 11:35.261
I'm Ilyana, wife of Doku.

11:35.625 --> 11:39.235
I have a note from my husband
for the man you work for.

11:40.043 --> 11:41.224
Get on.

12:13.772 --> 12:16.148
I have a message for General.

12:27.353 --> 12:29.752
As-salaam alaikum, Ilyana.

12:30.135 --> 12:31.341
<i>Alaikum as-salaam.</i>

12:31.376 --> 12:35.788
You look... as lovely as
you did on your wedding day.

12:35.877 --> 12:38.018
Thank you, General.

12:38.169 --> 12:41.522
But Doku should know
better than to surprise me.

12:41.557 --> 12:44.504
Even with a visitor as pretty as you.

12:44.539 --> 12:47.447
He told me you would be
angry, but he had no choice.

12:48.776 --> 12:51.173
What's happened to Jamilla?

12:51.274 --> 12:53.715
I believe everything is in note.

13:02.509 --> 13:06.104
_

13:14.271 --> 13:15.996
What is this place?

13:16.070 --> 13:18.739
The president's country house.

13:21.579 --> 13:23.634
Welcome to Chechnya, all of you!

13:25.540 --> 13:27.688
Long drive, my friend, huh?

13:27.809 --> 13:30.180
Yes, it was, Mr. President.

13:30.243 --> 13:31.512
Make yourself at home.

13:31.547 --> 13:32.398
Have something to eat.

13:32.433 --> 13:34.605
- Get some rest.
- Thank you,

13:34.640 --> 13:36.207
but I have to go back.

13:36.242 --> 13:37.736
Tamir needs me.

13:37.801 --> 13:40.559
Tell him I hope to see him in Prague.

13:43.890 --> 13:45.357
Good luck.

13:46.398 --> 13:47.592
Good-bye, Aunt.

13:47.627 --> 13:49.694
As-salaam alaikum.

13:50.247 --> 13:51.889
Katya.

13:53.683 --> 13:56.629
You are much too pretty to be a boy.

13:57.801 --> 13:59.152
Hmm?

14:02.498 --> 14:03.770
Ah.

14:03.860 --> 14:05.916
Now you are Chechen.

14:05.951 --> 14:07.221
Huh?

14:11.390 --> 14:15.012
_

14:16.132 --> 14:18.989
Everything's ready for you.

14:19.119 --> 14:22.151
You'll get more instructions
when you get to the hotel.

14:22.237 --> 14:23.699
I brought you clothes.

14:23.766 --> 14:25.135
For the trip.

14:26.819 --> 14:29.055
Money?

14:35.657 --> 14:38.606
You'll get the rest when
the work is done in Prague.

14:45.993 --> 14:49.186
<i>Dmitry was a Renaissance man.</i>

14:49.497 --> 14:52.669
Drug trafficking, extortion, suspect

14:52.704 --> 14:55.346
in three murders and the...

14:55.398 --> 14:58.596
attempted murder of an FBI agent.

15:01.268 --> 15:03.430
I said I would help you,

15:03.499 --> 15:05.124
but don't think I
wouldn't rather lock you up

15:05.159 --> 15:07.055
for the rest of your life.

15:07.332 --> 15:08.496
Anything you can tell us

15:08.531 --> 15:10.696
that's not in the files?

15:11.538 --> 15:13.327
You've got a problem.

15:13.747 --> 15:15.323
What's that?

15:16.065 --> 15:17.712
Before Ballard found you in Paris,

15:17.747 --> 15:20.404
he looked for you here, in Prague.

15:20.537 --> 15:22.297
He went to Tamir.

15:22.391 --> 15:24.128
What did Tamir tell him?

15:24.245 --> 15:26.052
He said he didn't know anything,

15:26.087 --> 15:28.444
hadn't heard from you in years.

15:28.608 --> 15:30.182
So think how suspicious it will seem

15:30.217 --> 15:32.720
when you suddenly turn up at his door.

15:45.851 --> 15:46.661
You didn't say

15:46.696 --> 15:50.414
- he would be here.
- They were afraid you wouldn't come if...

15:51.108 --> 15:52.835
if you knew.

15:55.538 --> 15:57.091
- Hello, Ilyana.
- What is this?

15:57.126 --> 16:00.472
- I thought this was about Kate.
- No, it is. She was with Tamir.

16:00.550 --> 16:04.677
- Tamir?
- And now she's missing, I'm afraid.

16:04.890 --> 16:07.251
Oh, God.

16:07.500 --> 16:09.810
Mrs. Crawford, we need you

16:09.845 --> 16:13.598
to tell us everything you
remember about Dmitry Petrovich.

16:17.981 --> 16:20.944
I was a covert operative.

16:21.117 --> 16:23.887
Dmitry was my cover.

16:27.830 --> 16:30.753
Dmitry was never real?

16:31.288 --> 16:33.503
No, I'm sorry.

16:44.733 --> 16:47.905
Tell me how to help you find Kate.

16:48.654 --> 16:51.398
<i>If I agreed to spy on my husband...</i>

16:53.059 --> 16:55.446
...help find the general,

16:56.286 --> 16:57.949
you...

16:58.837 --> 17:00.587
Dmitry...

17:00.868 --> 17:03.468
promised us passports.

17:05.013 --> 17:07.011
A new life.

17:07.123 --> 17:08.784
But at some point, the relationship

17:08.819 --> 17:10.917
became more intimate.

17:14.943 --> 17:16.249
- How did it start?
- What does any of this

17:16.284 --> 17:17.906
have to do with fooling Tamir?

17:17.941 --> 17:18.666
He was high all the time.

17:18.702 --> 17:21.038
I'm sure he doesn't remember anything.

17:23.686 --> 17:26.010
Just give us a minute.

17:26.124 --> 17:27.037
Let's, uh... let's get

17:27.071 --> 17:28.913
a cup of tea.

17:36.638 --> 17:39.208
<i>I know this isn't easy for you.</i>

17:39.591 --> 17:43.140
I'm learning what a nasty
piece of work Dmitry was.

17:45.206 --> 17:47.150
You don't understand.

17:47.508 --> 17:49.765
I'm sure I don't.

17:50.981 --> 17:53.774
But I obviously treated you very badly.

17:56.367 --> 17:58.806
Actually...

17:59.587 --> 18:01.529
you were very kind.

18:04.729 --> 18:07.899
You took care of us.

18:08.363 --> 18:10.810
You gave us a new life.

18:13.807 --> 18:16.339
Lived with us for three years.

18:17.272 --> 18:19.442
It was...

18:21.179 --> 18:23.501
...lovely.

18:23.797 --> 18:25.477
Then why wouldn't you speak to me when I...

18:25.512 --> 18:27.089
when I saw you in London?

18:27.156 --> 18:29.838
After you left, some people came to me.

18:30.757 --> 18:32.332
I thought they were gangsters.

18:35.091 --> 18:38.737
They told me if you ever came
back, I couldn't speak to you...

18:39.417 --> 18:41.720
...or...

18:42.549 --> 18:45.786
they would hurt Kate.

18:47.181 --> 18:49.737
Oh, Christ. I'm sorry.

18:55.119 --> 18:56.143
I don't understand it.

18:56.178 --> 18:58.712
You-you said I left you. Why?

18:58.777 --> 19:01.008
I don't really know.

19:02.446 --> 19:05.531
One day you became very cruel.

19:07.613 --> 19:11.034
You said everything you
ever told me was a lie.

19:12.255 --> 19:13.700
At the time, I couldn't believe it was

19:13.735 --> 19:16.104
really all lies.

19:20.021 --> 19:22.508
But from what I know now...

19:25.340 --> 19:29.737
..."all lies" was maybe the
one true thing you ever told me.

19:41.522 --> 19:44.938
_

19:54.272 --> 19:56.270
Did you see him?

20:14.304 --> 20:15.173
Good.

20:16.289 --> 20:17.691
How many guards?

20:17.783 --> 20:19.367
I only saw two.

20:19.483 --> 20:21.461
There could be more.

20:22.821 --> 20:24.854
You did very well.

20:25.839 --> 20:26.927
And now I'm done?

20:26.962 --> 20:29.223
Yes. I hope.

20:31.033 --> 20:33.528
It will move fast now.

20:34.458 --> 20:37.461
But we need to be more careful.

20:38.222 --> 20:39.629
Why?

20:39.959 --> 20:42.195
Has something happened?

20:43.111 --> 20:46.100
No. Nothing.

20:48.744 --> 20:50.513
I'll see you soon.

21:04.192 --> 21:06.562
Hello.

21:08.154 --> 21:09.348
Hello, sweetie.

21:09.433 --> 21:12.213
Bravo.

21:12.923 --> 21:14.991
From the general.

21:20.296 --> 21:21.612
- You have done well.
- Can you watch

21:21.647 --> 21:24.289
Katya a bit longer? I
want to get cleaned up.

21:24.349 --> 21:25.576
Of course.

21:32.827 --> 21:34.852
Oh.

21:44.353 --> 21:46.608
That's beautiful, Katya.

21:46.710 --> 21:48.769
Did Mama make it for you?

21:48.863 --> 21:52.068
No?

21:53.125 --> 21:54.829
Who did?

22:01.125 --> 22:02.613
Doku?

22:04.822 --> 22:06.618
What is this?

22:07.867 --> 22:10.276
- It's just a toy.
- Katya says

22:10.311 --> 22:13.920
your <i>friend</i> made it for her.

22:16.523 --> 22:18.192
What friend?

22:19.676 --> 22:21.565
It was Jamilla, I told you.

22:21.651 --> 22:24.065
Don't lie to me!

22:24.147 --> 22:25.640
What did you do with him? Huh?

22:25.674 --> 22:26.308
- What did you do?
- Nothing.

22:26.343 --> 22:29.009
Nothing. You whore!

22:30.205 --> 22:31.833
You betrayed me.

22:31.868 --> 22:34.638
Doku, no.

22:47.433 --> 22:48.490
Give me the gun.

22:48.537 --> 22:49.793
Give it to me.

23:08.578 --> 23:10.724
I loved you.

23:24.984 --> 23:28.443
Please come. I've done something terrible.

23:28.513 --> 23:30.467
Okay.

23:40.634 --> 23:42.746
In the bathroom.

23:42.881 --> 23:44.716
Put Katya to bed.

24:16.936 --> 24:18.461
The hell?

24:38.683 --> 24:40.938
What are you going to do with him?

24:41.777 --> 24:43.410
Don't worry.

24:44.326 --> 24:47.263
I'm going to make everything okay.

26:01.704 --> 26:03.429
Hey!

26:03.729 --> 26:05.182
Hey!

26:10.342 --> 26:11.938
What are you doing here?

26:12.074 --> 26:14.134
Huh? What are you doing here?

26:14.199 --> 26:16.200
Uh, Doku lets me sleep here.

26:16.232 --> 26:18.625
You know my name? Huh?

26:18.666 --> 26:21.147
Do you know my name?!

26:30.089 --> 26:33.469
If you ever say a word to anyone,

26:33.655 --> 26:35.008
I will find you,

26:35.074 --> 26:37.149
and I will kill you.

28:03.039 --> 28:05.003
You decided she was getting in the way,

28:05.073 --> 28:08.149
cocking up your plans for
me, so you murdered her.

28:08.365 --> 28:11.600
You've seen too many spy movies, Alex.

It's a tragedy.

29:00.649 --> 29:02.836
What's the play for approaching Tamir?

29:02.871 --> 29:06.836
You said Dmitry turning up would
be too much of a coincidence.

29:07.005 --> 29:08.840
What if it wasn't?

29:08.906 --> 29:10.256
How do you mean?

29:10.375 --> 29:11.927
I think I can use Ballard's visit

29:11.962 --> 29:15.242
to convince Tamir that Dmitry's
turned up for a good reason.

29:17.442 --> 29:20.879
If it works, your friend
won't have died for nothing.

29:32.446 --> 29:34.330
Piece of shit.

29:34.516 --> 29:35.992
I'm going to kill you.

29:36.054 --> 29:37.522
Dmitry?

29:37.592 --> 29:40.204
You sold me out to FBI.

29:40.633 --> 29:42.225
What... what are you talking about?

29:42.260 --> 29:43.862
Turn around!

29:44.135 --> 29:45.814
Hands on car.

29:46.970 --> 29:49.307
I don't understand. You-you
are making a mistake.

29:49.396 --> 29:51.033
Shut up!

30:01.326 --> 30:03.698
Ballard came to see you, no?

30:03.805 --> 30:05.629
A couple weeks ago, yes.

30:07.731 --> 30:09.217
You told him where to find me.

30:09.252 --> 30:11.087
How could I? I-I've
heard nothing about you

30:11.122 --> 30:12.796
- for years. Hey!
- Bullshit!

30:12.861 --> 30:14.167
You heard I was in Paris.

30:14.202 --> 30:16.606
You wanted FBI to arrest me. Why?

30:18.875 --> 30:20.732
Maybe you want to take
over my heroin business?

30:20.790 --> 30:23.916
Heroin? No. I'm not in
that business anymore.

30:24.057 --> 30:24.950
You have to believe me.

30:24.985 --> 30:26.693
If Ballard found you, I-I...

30:26.765 --> 30:28.528
It had nothing to do with me.

30:28.563 --> 30:29.342
- No?
- No!

30:29.377 --> 30:32.704
No. My cop friends tell
me Ballard was close.

30:32.847 --> 30:35.624
So I break into his hotel.

30:35.811 --> 30:37.919
Wait, just like for you.

30:40.148 --> 30:42.026
Stick gun in his face.

30:42.061 --> 30:44.948
Ask him, "How did you find me?"

30:46.920 --> 30:48.807
And he said I told him?

30:49.890 --> 30:51.643
Yes, he said this exactly.

30:53.263 --> 30:55.463
So I blew his head off.

30:58.729 --> 31:01.132
Put gun in his hand...

31:02.159 --> 31:03.976
so cops would think he did it himself.

31:05.779 --> 31:08.048
Now I do same to you.

31:08.098 --> 31:10.389
Please... you have to believe me.

31:10.424 --> 31:12.635
I didn't tell him anything.

31:12.670 --> 31:14.655
You saved my life. How could I betray you?

31:14.690 --> 31:16.032
How?

31:16.095 --> 31:18.348
Did you forget? You once framed me

31:18.383 --> 31:20.470
- for murder?
- I'm different now.

31:20.505 --> 31:22.320
When you knew me, I was drug addict,

31:22.355 --> 31:23.730
piece of shit.

31:23.809 --> 31:26.480
But you helped me. I never forgot it.

31:28.645 --> 31:31.185
If you are telling truth,

31:31.492 --> 31:32.567
then Ballard was lying.

31:32.633 --> 31:34.335
- Why would he do that?
- I don't know.

31:34.370 --> 31:35.996
He-he was always trying to get you.

31:36.031 --> 31:39.341
Crazy to get you.
May-maybe... he wanted revenge.

31:39.376 --> 31:42.848
- Revenge?
- For what you did to him, his-his leg.

31:43.318 --> 31:44.677
And when he knew you
were going to kill him,

31:44.741 --> 31:45.661
he lied about me.

31:45.696 --> 31:47.986
Some way to hurt both of us.

31:48.043 --> 31:49.966
I die, you go to jail for killing me,

31:50.001 --> 31:52.634
a-and Ballard finally wins.

31:53.433 --> 31:55.994
He was always very clever, no?

31:59.873 --> 32:01.673
I'm sorry.

32:02.558 --> 32:05.361
I have hot temper.

32:08.879 --> 32:11.186
I give you bit of advice.

32:11.221 --> 32:13.495
You need better security.

32:16.728 --> 32:18.578
I need to settle down.

32:18.613 --> 32:21.890
Get cleaned up. Can I use your washroom?

32:23.169 --> 32:24.339
Yeah.

32:24.374 --> 32:25.942
Of course.

33:23.127 --> 33:25.631
Ah. <i>Spaseeba.</i>

33:28.892 --> 33:29.732
What about you?

33:29.782 --> 33:32.246
I don't drink anymore.

33:32.281 --> 33:33.192
Why?

33:33.240 --> 33:35.451
No dope, no drink, no fun.

33:35.531 --> 33:37.357
It's not so bad.

33:42.030 --> 33:45.282
You... you do good for yourself.

33:46.123 --> 33:47.419
God's will...

33:47.518 --> 33:51.419
and a bit of monkey business.

33:51.857 --> 33:52.963
Yeah?

33:53.079 --> 33:55.550
I could use a little monkey business.

33:56.427 --> 33:57.460
You need money?

33:57.495 --> 34:00.833
Bad situation for me. Killed FBI guy.

34:00.895 --> 34:03.901
Cops roll up all my cash and product.

34:04.349 --> 34:06.411
A little breathing room. Take it, please.

34:06.446 --> 34:09.638
- Please.
- No. I don't want your handout.

34:09.835 --> 34:12.373
Maybe a job?

34:14.764 --> 34:18.034
I always came through for
you and your brother, no?

34:19.411 --> 34:21.380
Yes, you did.

34:22.264 --> 34:24.166
Let me think about it.

34:24.259 --> 34:26.063
Now, excuse me, I'm...

34:26.150 --> 34:26.880
I'm tired.

34:26.946 --> 34:29.420
- I'll text you my number.
- No text.

34:29.500 --> 34:30.773
Okay. I have room

34:30.808 --> 34:32.378
at Penzion Slezska.

34:32.433 --> 34:33.485
Contact me there.

34:33.560 --> 34:35.062
Maybe tomorrow.

34:35.641 --> 34:37.009
I will.

34:44.695 --> 34:47.831
Ilyana and your niece.

34:48.210 --> 34:50.783
How are they? Still in Prague?

34:50.860 --> 34:52.255
I haven't seen them for a long time.

34:52.291 --> 34:54.780
As long as I haven't seen you.

34:54.992 --> 34:55.780
Too bad.

34:55.815 --> 34:57.985
She was nice lady.

35:18.772 --> 35:20.877
Keystroke software's working.

35:21.025 --> 35:23.893
- Tamir's making a call.
- Can you I.D. the number?

35:25.162 --> 35:26.034
Prepaid.

35:26.092 --> 35:27.430
No name.

35:34.308 --> 35:36.003
Tamir, it's late.

35:36.065 --> 35:37.304
My children are sleeping.

35:37.366 --> 35:39.685
First Ballard came to
see me, now Petrovich.

35:39.720 --> 35:41.575
What's going on?

35:41.981 --> 35:44.115
Petrovich...

35:44.310 --> 35:45.979
I haven't heard that name in years.

35:46.014 --> 35:48.987
I want to know where he
was, what he was doing,

35:49.022 --> 35:51.155
arrests, prison.

35:51.294 --> 35:53.157
- Why?
- Doesn't matter.

35:53.209 --> 35:56.725
Find out if he killed Ballard in France.

35:56.841 --> 35:59.664
I heard it was a suicide.

36:00.302 --> 36:01.503
You heard that?

36:01.548 --> 36:03.702
Yes, in Paris.

36:04.441 --> 36:05.550
Check with your friends in police.

36:05.585 --> 36:07.713
Let me know what you find.

36:09.507 --> 36:10.421
Too fast...

36:10.456 --> 36:11.895
I couldn't get a location.

36:11.961 --> 36:13.903
Czech cops? Sounds like Tamir

36:13.938 --> 36:16.121
was talking to one of your guys.

36:16.966 --> 36:18.030
I'll look into it.

36:18.065 --> 36:21.246
See if anyone in the department
tries to access records.

36:21.281 --> 36:23.214
Well, let us know what you find.

36:23.287 --> 36:25.064
Of course.

36:30.232 --> 36:32.524
_

36:33.279 --> 36:35.493
_

36:36.229 --> 36:38.208
_

36:38.551 --> 36:42.223
_

36:42.838 --> 36:44.253
_

36:44.609 --> 36:46.359
_

36:46.493 --> 36:48.493
_

36:48.668 --> 36:51.549
_

36:54.374 --> 36:57.215
_

36:57.578 --> 37:01.238
_

37:01.568 --> 37:03.859
_

37:04.523 --> 37:07.474
_

37:12.610 --> 37:14.175
_

37:51.069 --> 37:53.780
Best to stay in room.

38:03.164 --> 38:05.152
_

38:05.187 --> 38:07.304
<i>Katya's okay?</i>

38:07.452 --> 38:09.378
Yes, just as you wanted it.

38:09.461 --> 38:12.931
The other matter is... handled, too.

38:13.034 --> 38:14.404
That's good.

38:16.202 --> 38:17.572
You should rest.

38:17.660 --> 38:20.369
But first, I have one more task for you.

38:21.192 --> 38:22.876
An old friend is in town.

38:22.911 --> 38:25.979
I owe him. Bring him this.

38:28.275 --> 38:29.473
Heavy.

38:29.520 --> 38:32.484
He asked for work, but now it's too hot.

38:33.473 --> 38:35.001
His name is Dmitry.

38:35.087 --> 38:37.253
Russian guy. Hair slicked back.

38:37.288 --> 38:41.061
He'll be at the bar at Penzion Slezska.

38:41.096 --> 38:42.734
Slezska.

38:44.326 --> 38:48.044
_

38:57.714 --> 38:59.925
Have you talked to our man?

39:01.077 --> 39:03.680
Since the unfortunate incident?

39:03.797 --> 39:04.773
Hate to think you people

39:04.808 --> 39:06.872
had anything to do with what happened.

39:06.911 --> 39:08.615
Please.

39:09.322 --> 39:12.070
You have, uh... quite the imagination.

39:12.315 --> 39:14.764
Terrible accident.

39:15.887 --> 39:17.180
But now you make sure...

39:17.215 --> 39:19.651
life moves on for him.

39:22.825 --> 39:24.562
You understand?

39:37.753 --> 39:40.071
The Service has asked about you.

39:42.167 --> 39:44.662
They're still willing to take you on.

39:44.725 --> 39:47.431
You mean now that my Commie wife is dead?

39:47.596 --> 39:48.999
Look...

39:50.832 --> 39:52.801
you've had a blow.

39:53.009 --> 39:55.103
Crushing, really.

39:55.576 --> 39:57.169
But the Service is a kind of family.

39:57.204 --> 39:59.207
We look out for each other.

40:03.223 --> 40:05.331
Take some time. Think about it.

40:06.395 --> 40:08.746
There's nothing for you here, Alex.

40:09.306 --> 40:11.308
You know where you're meant to be.

40:18.048 --> 40:20.282
_

40:42.543 --> 40:44.286
You give him money?

40:50.042 --> 40:51.798
I'm so sorry, Uncle.

40:51.919 --> 40:54.270
I should have told you before...

40:54.311 --> 40:56.459
but I was just a kid.

40:56.602 --> 40:58.202
What are you talking about?

40:58.269 --> 41:00.013
I was scared.

41:00.161 --> 41:03.636
He said he'd kill me
if I ever said anything.

41:04.427 --> 41:05.494
Who?

41:05.582 --> 41:07.930
That man... Dmitry.

41:11.588 --> 41:14.425
I saw him kill your brother.

41:28.540 --> 41:30.013
For you.

41:37.705 --> 41:39.302
Yes?

41:39.513 --> 41:42.622
Dmitry, my old friend.

41:44.148 --> 41:47.253
Good news: I have
something for you after all.

41:49.020 --> 41:50.579
Thank you.

41:51.924 --> 41:55.196
I'll pick you up at your
hotel tomorrow at 10:00.
