WEBVTT

00:01.202 --> 00:03.737
-I'm a
once-in-a-generation artist.
-Oh.

00:03.771 --> 00:06.874
Who just got verified
on Twitter, about,
what, nine days ago?

00:06.907 --> 00:09.177
I'm glad you feel good
that a robot told you
you're worth it.

00:09.210 --> 00:10.578
* Hi, I'm Dave *

00:26.127 --> 00:28.229
(odd creaking sound)

00:32.733 --> 00:34.868
(sound repeats)

00:36.304 --> 00:38.806
What the...

00:41.575 --> 00:43.043
Who the hell gave you permission

00:43.077 --> 00:45.113
to monkey around
with my precious volumes?

00:45.146 --> 00:46.547
I have no idea what
you're talking about.

00:46.580 --> 00:47.848
NANDOR:
What has he done now?

00:47.881 --> 00:50.050
He's been monkeying around
with my precious volumes.

00:50.084 --> 00:53.053
-No, I haven't been monkey--
I haven't touched your books.
-Oh, really?

00:53.087 --> 00:55.523
Well, explain this.

00:55.556 --> 00:57.225
Shit, he's taken it up
a notch.

00:57.258 --> 00:58.559
That's worse than before.

00:58.592 --> 01:00.694
Guillermo, why would you
do such a thing?

01:00.728 --> 01:02.696
I didn't do it. I-I haven't even
been in this room.

01:02.730 --> 01:03.931
I wasn't even here.

01:03.964 --> 01:05.099
LASZLO:
Well, you're in there now.

01:05.133 --> 01:06.967
-NADJA: What's going on?
-LASZLO: It's Gizmo.

01:07.000 --> 01:08.636
He's been causing havoc
in the household.

01:08.669 --> 01:11.071
Ooh.

01:11.105 --> 01:12.840
Look. Look.

01:16.510 --> 01:19.447
"Laszlo sucks," backwards.

01:19.480 --> 01:21.149
LASZLO:
Laszlo doesn't suck.

01:21.182 --> 01:23.284
And if he did, he certainly
wouldn't do it backwards.

01:23.317 --> 01:24.285
GUILLERMO:
I didn't write it.

01:24.318 --> 01:26.454
NADJA:
Hmm.

01:26.487 --> 01:27.988
We've got ghosts.

01:28.021 --> 01:29.423
-Bullshit.
-(Nadja groans)

01:29.457 --> 01:32.059
(Laszlo grunts)

01:32.092 --> 01:34.162
("You're Dead"
by Norma Tanega playing)

01:34.195 --> 01:36.730
* Don't sing if you want
to live long *

01:36.764 --> 01:39.167
* They have no use
for your song *

01:39.200 --> 01:41.902
* You're dead, you're dead,
you're dead *

01:41.935 --> 01:44.772
* You're dead
and out of this world *

01:46.307 --> 01:49.343
* Now your hope and compassion
is gone *

01:49.377 --> 01:52.112
* You sold out your dream
to the world *

01:52.146 --> 01:54.448
* Stay dead, stay dead,
stay dead *

01:54.482 --> 01:57.117
* You're dead
and out of this world. *

02:06.560 --> 02:09.029
A ghost is the spirit
of a person who has died,

02:09.062 --> 02:12.200
but still has unfinished
business

02:12.233 --> 02:13.267
on this mortal plane.

02:13.301 --> 02:14.602
There's no such thing
as ghosts.

02:14.635 --> 02:16.103
Okay, here we go again.

02:16.136 --> 02:17.505
My wife comes from
the kind of town

02:17.538 --> 02:19.840
that believes in all this kind
of superstitious nonsense.

02:19.873 --> 02:21.942
She also thinks
goblins are real.

02:21.975 --> 02:24.378
Personally, I'm a man
of science.

02:24.412 --> 02:27.181
All right, then, Dr. Arsehole,
how does your science

02:27.215 --> 02:29.617
-explain what we just saw?
-Now, you see,

02:29.650 --> 02:31.151
it can be one of two things.

02:31.185 --> 02:32.453
One, a mercurical zephyr.

02:32.486 --> 02:34.488
Two, it's a farrago of gasses,

02:34.522 --> 02:36.123
possibly from a peat bog.

02:36.156 --> 02:38.326
Now, if you capture these
and add them together,

02:38.359 --> 02:41.195
-using yellow bile
from a plague victim...
-(hisses)

02:41.229 --> 02:43.531
...you've got what
looks like a ghost.

02:43.564 --> 02:45.533
-But it's science.
-Ooh! (blows raspberry)

02:45.566 --> 02:47.201
NANDOR:
Ghosts are

02:47.235 --> 02:49.203
the stuff of fairy tales.

02:49.237 --> 02:51.472
Stories we tell children
to frighten out

02:51.505 --> 02:54.242
their excess energy
so that they might

02:54.275 --> 02:56.544
-slumber more peacefully.
-GUILLERMO: Huh.

02:58.712 --> 03:00.848
Did you say something?

03:00.881 --> 03:03.351
I'm sorry, vampires are real,
but ghosts are not?

03:03.384 --> 03:07.588
He's heard too many
fairy stories from Nadja.

03:07.621 --> 03:08.722
No, I actually just want
to make sure

03:08.756 --> 03:09.823
we're on the same page.

03:09.857 --> 03:11.892
You know, after years
of working for you,

03:11.925 --> 03:14.262
a known vampire,
I have seen

03:14.295 --> 03:16.264
-werewolves, necromancers...
-(growling)

03:16.297 --> 03:18.065
...a zombie
and several Babadooks,

03:18.098 --> 03:20.200
but a ghost, that's where
we draw the line.

03:20.234 --> 03:22.770
Several?
You saw one Bababook.

03:22.803 --> 03:25.205
-Several Ba--
-Don't exaggerate.

03:26.607 --> 03:28.509
Do I believe in ghosts?
Uh, no.

03:28.542 --> 03:30.110
Color me skeptical.

03:30.143 --> 03:34.582
Um, though, maybe it's ghosts
that are always stealing

03:34.615 --> 03:38.452
that one sock from the dryer.
(laughs)

03:38.486 --> 03:42.189
I've been experimenting
with, uh, humor

03:42.222 --> 03:44.692
to drain energy.

03:44.725 --> 03:47.227
Which reminds me,
does anyone here

03:47.261 --> 03:49.196
have any updog?

03:49.229 --> 03:51.699
Updog?

03:51.732 --> 03:53.534
If I didn't know
what updog was,

03:53.567 --> 03:56.570
I would at least ask-ask me.
(chuckles)

03:58.439 --> 04:03.311
Hey, everybody, look at
my enormous crystal balls.

04:03.344 --> 04:07.247
Maybe these ghosts will
bring with them some updog.

04:07.281 --> 04:11.819
Guillermo, did you get my joke
about my enormous balls?

04:11.852 --> 04:14.254
-I did, Master.
-NADJA: Silence!

04:14.288 --> 04:15.423
The time is nigh.

04:15.456 --> 04:17.325
Everybody join hands.

04:17.358 --> 04:19.159
COLIN:
Sorry if my hands are
a little oily.

04:19.192 --> 04:21.829
It's from my rash cream.

04:21.862 --> 04:24.832
NADJA:
Troubled spirits,
draw ye near.

04:24.865 --> 04:29.269
Uncloak yourselves
and reveal to us your forms

04:29.303 --> 04:30.638
on this terrestrial plane.

04:30.671 --> 04:34.241
I beseech you,
using the ancient words.

04:34.274 --> 04:35.676
'Eye' tis ka lay

04:35.709 --> 04:39.847
ksenikon e patroion,
e pakouston e foraton e keye,

04:39.880 --> 04:41.682
kath-eye-restho hon-'pear'

04:41.715 --> 04:44.117
apokatharet-eye.

04:44.151 --> 04:45.986
(vocalizing)

04:46.019 --> 04:47.521
Mm...

04:47.555 --> 04:49.089
(loud creaking)

04:49.122 --> 04:51.559
(creaking moan echoes)

04:54.294 --> 04:56.864
-Guillermo, did you make a fart?
-No.

04:56.897 --> 04:59.132
I think someone summoned
a breakfast burrito.

04:59.166 --> 05:00.133
Silence!

05:00.167 --> 05:02.269
A spirit is struggling
to be heard.

05:02.302 --> 05:06.106
Is it maybe a spirit
who's struggling with IBS?

05:06.139 --> 05:08.141
(laughter)

05:08.175 --> 05:10.177
You have ruined
the energy of the sÃ©ance

05:10.210 --> 05:13.046
with your toilet potty
poo-poo-mouth humor!

05:13.080 --> 05:16.283
And a price will be paid.
You fools!

05:16.316 --> 05:20.821
Nadja, we were only joking.

05:20.854 --> 05:22.122
Idiots.

05:22.155 --> 05:24.825
(sighs)

05:28.028 --> 05:29.530
(Nadja gasps)

05:32.366 --> 05:33.367
Oh, yes.

05:33.401 --> 05:36.236
Jeff... Jesk.

05:36.269 --> 05:38.005
So you are a ghost now, yes?

05:38.038 --> 05:40.674
My Nadja.

05:40.708 --> 05:42.576
For an eternity,
I have longed to hear

05:42.610 --> 05:45.245
your sweet, angelic voice
say my name again.

05:45.278 --> 05:47.247
Well, it's only been a few
months since you died,

05:47.280 --> 05:50.484
but that's...
Thank you, very nice.

05:50.518 --> 05:52.319
I have missed you so.

05:52.352 --> 05:53.754
Sorry, can I just stop you?

05:53.787 --> 05:55.889
It's really weird
with you down there.

05:55.923 --> 05:57.190
If you could--
Sorry, the head.

05:57.224 --> 05:59.092
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah,
yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

05:59.126 --> 06:00.661
-Put it back on the neck.
Sorry, it's just...
-Right, right, right, right.

06:00.694 --> 06:03.063
-Duh. Ew.
-Ugh. (chuckles)

06:03.096 --> 06:04.097
This is better, huh?

06:04.131 --> 06:05.198
So much better.

06:05.232 --> 06:08.602
-Thanks.
-So, Jesk, what can I...

06:08.636 --> 06:11.104
Um, sorry for not taking you
seriously, my darling.

06:11.138 --> 06:13.741
(scoffs) And what do you
think about it now?

06:13.774 --> 06:15.275
What do I think about what?

06:15.308 --> 06:16.544
Jesk, say something.

06:16.577 --> 06:18.712
Hey, thanks for
cutting my head off.

06:18.746 --> 06:21.348
-Again. You dick.
-NADJA: Now, now.

06:21.381 --> 06:23.383
He was just doing
his husbandly duties.

06:23.417 --> 06:25.185
Who are you talking to,
my darling?

06:25.218 --> 06:26.353
Can't you see him?

06:26.386 --> 06:29.356
There's nobody there, my dear.
Are you okay?

06:29.389 --> 06:31.391
-He's sitting right there.
-There's no one there.

06:31.425 --> 06:33.193
-But he's...
-I'll, uh,

06:33.226 --> 06:34.462
just go back inside
and leave you

06:34.495 --> 06:37.064
to, uh, talking to the air.

06:38.666 --> 06:41.301
Shit.

06:41.334 --> 06:43.036
Nandor!

06:43.070 --> 06:45.238
-There's a fucking ghost
on the front lawn.
-What?

06:45.272 --> 06:47.240
-Not you, too.
-I couldn't believe it myself.

06:47.274 --> 06:50.143
But what mine own eyes have
seen, mine own eyes have seen.

06:50.177 --> 06:51.278
I pretended I couldn't see it,

06:51.311 --> 06:53.213
which will give us
the element of surprise.

06:53.246 --> 06:56.216
-Okay. Okay.
-We must act quickly.

06:56.249 --> 06:57.451
Take the large one.

06:57.485 --> 06:58.619
Yes, good idea.

06:58.652 --> 07:00.921
Yeah, that's better.

07:00.954 --> 07:02.823
Right, where's this
fucking ghost?!

07:02.856 --> 07:05.593
(shouting)

07:05.626 --> 07:06.727
JEFF:
...ghost stuff.

07:06.760 --> 07:10.464
Aah! Get ready to swallow
my sword! (grunts)

07:10.498 --> 07:12.533
But it's... What the fuck?

07:18.506 --> 07:20.240
Whoa, shit.

07:20.273 --> 07:22.275
-That's wild.
-Thank you!

07:22.309 --> 07:24.612
-So, this...
-You need to keep
your voice down, otherwise

07:24.645 --> 07:26.647
-that thing will hear us.
-I can hear you.

07:26.680 --> 07:27.981
Now look what you've done.

07:28.015 --> 07:30.017
-What is this gloopy shit?
-Huh.

07:30.050 --> 07:31.451
Looks like ectoplasm.

07:31.485 --> 07:33.821
-Is that right?
-(chuckling): I guess so.

07:33.854 --> 07:37.357
-Is there any in my hair?
-Yeah, yeah. Oh, yeah.

07:37.390 --> 07:38.458
Guillermo, tissue, please.

07:38.492 --> 07:40.528
-COLIN: Quite a bit.
-NANDOR: Fucking guy.

07:40.561 --> 07:41.695
That thing needs to be gone.

07:41.729 --> 07:42.963
He's not going to hurt us.

07:42.996 --> 07:45.533
-You're not going
to hurt them, right?
-No.

07:45.566 --> 07:46.967
I'm not gonna hurt you guys.

07:47.000 --> 07:48.468
-I'm just here
to scare you guys.
-LASZLO: Bollocks.

07:48.502 --> 07:49.970
-Well, we're not scared.
-You should be scared of us.

07:50.003 --> 07:51.805
-NADJA: Calm down.
-Really?

07:51.839 --> 07:53.507
How about now?

07:53.541 --> 07:55.375
-Been there, done that.
-JEFF: How about now?

07:55.408 --> 07:56.710
(roaring)

07:56.744 --> 07:59.847
(all screaming)

07:59.880 --> 08:01.348
NADJA:
Cut it out!

08:01.381 --> 08:03.651
-Would you stop it!?
-(chuckles)

08:03.684 --> 08:06.053
Pardon me, ghost.

08:06.086 --> 08:07.721
Later, man.
It was nice meeting you.

08:07.755 --> 08:10.524
So here's the situation.

08:10.558 --> 08:13.493
Every time my human ex-lover
is reincarnated,

08:13.527 --> 08:16.897
our bodies call to one another.

08:16.930 --> 08:20.734
But without a body,
he's all Jesk and no Gregor.

08:20.768 --> 08:22.135
And it stinks.

08:22.169 --> 08:25.238
My unfinished business,
how it torments me.

08:25.272 --> 08:29.242
-Please, help me complete it
so I may leave this plane.
-Sure.

08:29.276 --> 08:31.545
But what, exactly,
do you want me to do?

08:31.579 --> 08:34.214
Just, like, swear that
you'll help me...

08:34.247 --> 08:36.183
Do what?! No.
I don't have time for this.

08:36.216 --> 08:38.151
My husband is shitting himself
down the road.

08:38.185 --> 08:40.120
All right, all right.
I love you.

08:41.555 --> 08:43.691
-And a little to the left.
-(groans)

08:43.724 --> 08:46.493
-It sort of looks like updog.
-(hisses)

08:46.526 --> 08:49.262
(growls)
These ghosts, what are they?

08:49.296 --> 08:50.731
NADJA:
Humans have bodies.

08:50.764 --> 08:52.933
And within the body
resides the spirit.

08:52.966 --> 08:56.103
When the human dies,
the spirit is released.

08:56.136 --> 08:58.572
And that spirit is a ghost!

08:58.606 --> 09:01.274
We are all dead, technically.

09:01.308 --> 09:02.710
You, me and Laszlo.

09:02.743 --> 09:05.245
Each of us died
when we became vampires.

09:05.278 --> 09:07.080
Colin Robinson
I'm not so sure about.

09:07.114 --> 09:08.548
But the three of us.

09:08.582 --> 09:11.518
Yeah, I'm not positive
what my deal is either,

09:11.551 --> 09:14.087
so I just sort of
keep on truckin'.

09:14.121 --> 09:15.789
But what is the point?

09:15.823 --> 09:18.025
If we are technically dead,
like he says,

09:18.058 --> 09:19.226
could ghosts of us exist?

09:19.259 --> 09:22.095
No, but--

09:22.129 --> 09:23.430
Huh.

09:23.463 --> 09:26.800
-Hmm.
-Hmm.

09:26.834 --> 09:27.935
Huh...

09:27.968 --> 09:30.804
-Not now.
-Shut up.

09:30.838 --> 09:33.941
Hootorektas e-'pay' k-elastero

09:41.148 --> 09:43.450
Ooh, what the blazes?

09:43.483 --> 09:46.219
-(echoing): Where am I?
-NADJA: Bloody hell.

09:46.253 --> 09:48.455
(shouts in foreign language)

09:48.488 --> 09:50.590
-That looks like me.
-What have you done?

09:50.624 --> 09:52.159
Get off me.

09:52.192 --> 09:55.062
(ghosts speaking
foreign languages)

09:55.095 --> 09:56.496
LASZLO:
Be quiet.

09:59.132 --> 10:01.669
Laszlo, he's wearing
your old night skirt.

10:01.702 --> 10:04.604
He is. Got nothing underneath it
by the looks of it.

10:06.339 --> 10:08.776
It's like looking in the mirror.

10:08.809 --> 10:11.144
So handsome.

10:11.178 --> 10:12.646
I didn't even know

10:12.680 --> 10:15.448
I had any unfinished business
when I died.

10:15.482 --> 10:16.784
But, as you can see,

10:16.817 --> 10:18.318
I have a ghost,

10:18.351 --> 10:19.586
so there must be something.

10:19.619 --> 10:21.421
(ghost shouting
in foreign language)

10:21.454 --> 10:23.891
Guillermo, can you help him
with that, please?

10:25.893 --> 10:29.362
-He seems very agitated
and restless.
-(shouting)

10:29.396 --> 10:33.834
And also, he doesn't seem
to speak any English.

10:33.867 --> 10:35.035
Excuse me.

10:35.068 --> 10:39.472
(speaking foreign language)

10:39.506 --> 10:41.641
I can't believe
I've completely forgotten

10:41.675 --> 10:43.276
how to speak
Al Qolnidarese.

10:43.310 --> 10:46.146
My own language.
So embarrassing.

10:46.179 --> 10:48.115
Guillermo, what is he saying?

10:48.148 --> 10:50.150
How-how would I know?

10:50.183 --> 10:53.320
I do remember how to say
"Good morning," though.

10:53.353 --> 10:54.788
GHOST NANDOR:
Aspam...

10:54.822 --> 10:56.757
Sob bekher.

10:57.825 --> 10:59.026
Baleh?

10:59.059 --> 11:00.861
Sob bekher.

11:00.894 --> 11:02.896
(speaking foreign language)

11:04.732 --> 11:06.299
Yeah, no, that's all I've got.

11:06.333 --> 11:08.168
Aspam oonjahss.

11:10.537 --> 11:12.005
You could have learned
to play the bouzouki,

11:12.039 --> 11:13.707
you could have learned
to play the zither,

11:13.741 --> 11:16.376
you could have warmed six
million flatbreads on hot coals.

11:16.409 --> 11:18.078
You could have done
one thousand things

11:18.111 --> 11:20.213
a one thousand times,
but what have you done?

11:20.247 --> 11:22.649
Well, I have some things I've
been planning on getting to.

11:22.682 --> 11:25.418
MalÃ¡ka! All you do
is sit around this house

11:25.452 --> 11:27.654
with these two dumb men
just talking

11:27.687 --> 11:29.656
about their willies
and their arseholes.

11:29.689 --> 11:32.192
I wouldn't call them dumb.

11:32.225 --> 11:33.660
-And their farts.
-Whatever.

11:33.693 --> 11:35.328
Enough about me. What about you?

11:35.362 --> 11:37.430
How can I help you finish
your unfinished business?

11:37.464 --> 11:39.366
Oh...
(exclaims in Greek)

11:39.399 --> 11:40.768
You are my unfinished business.

11:40.801 --> 11:42.770
How can I rest
until you do something

11:42.803 --> 11:44.571
with your eternal life?

11:44.604 --> 11:47.174
Instead of sitting around here
like a bump on a log's ass.

11:47.207 --> 11:49.542
What? Like, learning
to play the bouzouki?

11:49.576 --> 11:51.779
-That might be a start! Ugh...
-Oh... (exclaims in Greek)

11:51.812 --> 11:53.013
BOTH:
...you are absolutely
impossible.

11:53.046 --> 11:55.548
-I am like...
-(laughs)

11:55.582 --> 11:57.684
(both laugh)

11:57.717 --> 11:59.052
We said exactly the same...

11:59.086 --> 12:01.021
We did the same with the words.

12:01.054 --> 12:03.123
Oh, come on.

12:03.156 --> 12:06.293
Hey. I was, uh, just giving you
an update on my, um...

12:06.326 --> 12:08.195
(clears throat)
...unfinished business?

12:08.228 --> 12:09.797
It remains unfinished.

12:09.830 --> 12:12.632
-So, if you have...
-All right, not now, Jesk.

12:12.665 --> 12:14.935
Yeah, okay.

12:14.968 --> 12:17.404
Who was that pasty
little piece of hummus?

12:17.437 --> 12:18.772
I'm telling you,
don't even go there, girly.

12:18.806 --> 12:21.141
Nothing but a pain
and the heartache.

12:21.174 --> 12:23.543
Sounds like somebody
has gone there

12:23.576 --> 12:24.744
-and then come back from there.
-(laughs)

12:24.778 --> 12:26.379
Well, what can I say?

12:26.413 --> 12:28.048
I'm a ravenous little monster.

12:28.081 --> 12:30.818
We both are.
We're very, very horny.

12:30.851 --> 12:33.253
(both laugh)

12:33.286 --> 12:36.323
I bagged this chap on a midnight
sojourn to the Lake District.

12:36.356 --> 12:38.792
-Keswick?
-Grasmere, actually.

12:38.826 --> 12:41.261
Grasmere, yeah, I used to visit
a duchess in Grasmere.

12:41.294 --> 12:44.331
-Yes, I remember.
-Yes, of course you do.

12:44.364 --> 12:47.600
Now I am led to believe that
your presence here indicates

12:47.634 --> 12:51.571
some kind of unfinished business
on this terrestrial plane.

12:51.604 --> 12:53.974
-Indeed so.
-Sorry about that, old chap.

12:54.007 --> 12:55.943
-Anything I can help with?
-Well, actually, yes.

12:55.976 --> 12:57.510
I believe you can.

12:57.544 --> 12:59.646
You remember the night
you officially died, I presume?

12:59.679 --> 13:01.348
Oh, I remember it well.

13:01.381 --> 13:04.117
My lovely Nadja came in through
the window, took my life,

13:04.151 --> 13:06.920
thus making me the vampire
you see before you now.

13:06.954 --> 13:08.621
A damn handsome one at that,
I might say.

13:08.655 --> 13:10.924
(laughs)
You're too kind.

13:10.958 --> 13:13.994
Now, you remember the precise
moment Nadja took our life,

13:14.027 --> 13:16.696
I was on the verge
of a sexual climax.

13:16.729 --> 13:19.699
Well, here's the thing. I was
on the verge of fulfillment,

13:19.732 --> 13:22.435
yet I couldn't quite finish.

13:22.469 --> 13:24.271
Ah. I see.

13:24.304 --> 13:27.607
You want to finish
your final human orgasm?

13:27.640 --> 13:29.977
Yes. I have tried to finish
myself off with these hands,

13:30.010 --> 13:31.478
but they're ghost hands.

13:31.511 --> 13:33.346
-They don't have
the necessary stimulus.
-Hmm.

13:33.380 --> 13:34.948
How irritating.

13:34.982 --> 13:37.484
Yeah, whereas your meat hands,
I'm convinced,

13:37.517 --> 13:41.688
would give me the traction
for full sexual release.

13:53.166 --> 13:54.501
Things are not going so great.

13:54.534 --> 13:57.337
The language barrier
is insurmountable.

13:57.370 --> 13:59.672
Een khar asan zabooneh
khodesham yadesh nist.

13:59.706 --> 14:02.075
Khejahlatam khoob chisiyeh.

14:03.276 --> 14:05.145
Evah.

14:05.178 --> 14:06.679
Aspam oonjahss.

14:09.016 --> 14:11.684
You want to learn how to paint?

14:11.718 --> 14:14.922
Nah. Aspam.

14:14.955 --> 14:17.090
Aspam John.

14:17.124 --> 14:19.326
Yes, my horse John.

14:19.359 --> 14:20.527
John.

14:20.560 --> 14:22.495
Yes.

14:22.529 --> 14:24.164
I get it now.

14:24.197 --> 14:26.333
Aspam John.

14:26.366 --> 14:29.569
Areh. Aspam John.

14:29.602 --> 14:33.073
Aspam means "my horse."

14:33.106 --> 14:34.707
John.

14:34.741 --> 14:37.077
NANDOR:
John was my closest companion.

14:37.110 --> 14:39.846
Closer than even members
of my own family.

14:39.879 --> 14:43.283
House slaves, concubines,

14:43.316 --> 14:45.618
37 wives.

14:45.652 --> 14:49.923
Sometimes I would feed him nuts
and berries from my own mouth.

14:49.957 --> 14:51.925
He would accompany me
everywhere.

14:51.959 --> 14:53.726
On the battlefield,

14:53.760 --> 14:56.863
as I relentlessly slaughtered
thousands of enemies.

14:56.896 --> 15:00.633
And also, he would be there
when I felt a little sad.

15:01.901 --> 15:04.137
John.

15:04.171 --> 15:06.573
(both laugh)

15:06.606 --> 15:09.209
We have decided that my ghost

15:09.242 --> 15:10.944
is going to stick around
for a while.

15:10.978 --> 15:12.912
Because we're having
a real laugh together.

15:12.946 --> 15:14.447
(laughs)

15:14.481 --> 15:15.748
A very funny hat situation.

15:15.782 --> 15:17.917
Two. One and two.

15:17.951 --> 15:21.621
-(whoops)
-You know, it is just so nice

15:21.654 --> 15:23.323
to have someone smart
to talk to for a change.

15:23.356 --> 15:26.159
I love Laszlo, I do,
but it's always...

15:26.193 --> 15:28.161
-Of course.
-(Laszlo impression):
"Ah, darling, I seem

15:28.195 --> 15:30.230
"to have got my crotch stuck

15:30.263 --> 15:33.600
-to the taxidermy fox's mouth
again. Whoopsie."
-So desperate.

15:33.633 --> 15:35.335
You know?
And Nandor is just like,

15:35.368 --> 15:37.504
(Nandor impression): "Oh,
this battle and that battle."

15:37.537 --> 15:39.806
So much toxic masculinity
in the Ottoman Empire.

15:39.839 --> 15:42.175
-Serious. Real problem.
-(regular voice): It is a lot me

15:42.209 --> 15:45.145
sitting there silently,
nodding and smiling politely

15:45.178 --> 15:47.180
and not a lot of plain talk.

15:47.214 --> 15:50.150
Until this one came along.

15:50.183 --> 15:53.153
Oh. Hang on.
(gasps)

15:53.186 --> 15:54.854
Ooh.

15:54.887 --> 15:57.357
-You know,
that could be perfect.
-Do you like?

15:57.390 --> 15:59.926
-I love.
-Okay, so do we need
to do any sort

15:59.959 --> 16:03.830
of occult procedure
or ceremony or...

16:03.863 --> 16:05.865
Ah. It was that easy.

16:05.898 --> 16:08.868
Oh, yes. Yes,
this will do nicely.

16:08.901 --> 16:10.770
-(footsteps approaching)
-(laughs) Oh, shh. Shh, shh.

16:10.803 --> 16:12.939
No more talking.
I don't want the boys to know

16:12.972 --> 16:14.541
that you have taken a new form.

16:14.574 --> 16:15.842
I don't think
they would understand.

16:15.875 --> 16:18.045
-JEFF: Hey, Nadja?
-(sighs)

16:18.078 --> 16:20.947
My unfinished business, please?

16:20.980 --> 16:24.184
Gregor, please, just fuck off
for real this time.

16:24.217 --> 16:27.154
Listen, will you at least
hear my tales of woe?

16:27.187 --> 16:29.989
I want to tell you about them,
I need to tell you about them.

16:30.023 --> 16:33.493
Jesk, you are very sweet,

16:33.526 --> 16:35.628
but you're not
my responsibility anymore.

16:35.662 --> 16:38.398
Jesk, I think you need
to hear this.

16:38.431 --> 16:41.368
You are just a lovely guy that
I took very strong sex with

16:41.401 --> 16:43.136
a few hundred thousand times,

16:43.170 --> 16:45.972
and then my husband
cut your head off. Move on!

16:46.005 --> 16:48.541
So you have been busy
these past 700 years.

16:48.575 --> 16:50.210
(Ghost Nadja laughs)

16:50.243 --> 16:51.844
So you want me to go?

16:51.878 --> 16:54.681
-Go!
-All right, all right.

16:54.714 --> 16:56.649
Oh, he's so pathetic.

16:56.683 --> 16:58.251
I love it.

16:59.286 --> 17:01.354
Seriously. Call me.

17:01.388 --> 17:02.755
Jesk!

17:03.956 --> 17:05.725
-Mm-hmm.
-GHOST NADJA:
See you again soon,

17:05.758 --> 17:06.726
you tasty little honeypot.

17:06.759 --> 17:08.495
(kissing sounds)

17:08.528 --> 17:11.398
Tonne a'otonne-tropon

17:11.431 --> 17:13.533
kathi-restao.

17:13.566 --> 17:17.070
Hon-pear apokatharet-eye.

17:19.239 --> 17:21.174
Yuck.

17:21.208 --> 17:24.444
-(speaks foreign language)
-(horse neighing)

17:24.477 --> 17:26.479
(hooves clopping)

17:33.153 --> 17:35.155
(whinnies softly)

17:38.291 --> 17:41.894
-Aspam John.
-John.

17:41.928 --> 17:43.263
NANDOR:
John?

17:43.296 --> 17:45.298
I have missed you so.

17:45.332 --> 17:48.701
I never thought I would
see you again.

17:48.735 --> 17:51.538
John and I were
inseparable, but, uh,

17:51.571 --> 17:55.142
eventually, I had to eat him.

17:55.175 --> 17:58.245
My army and myself found
ourselves stranded

17:58.278 --> 17:59.712
with no food.

17:59.746 --> 18:02.048
I ate John.

18:02.081 --> 18:05.017
I wept the entire meal...

18:06.353 --> 18:09.789
...even though
he tasted delicious.

18:09.822 --> 18:11.224
(speaking foreign language)

18:11.258 --> 18:13.326
NANDOR:
Been a good boy, yes?

18:13.360 --> 18:14.961
(whinnies softly)

18:14.994 --> 18:16.596
(speaks foreign language)

18:16.629 --> 18:20.267
John? What is happening?

18:20.300 --> 18:22.669
-Where are they going?
-COLIN: I think your ghost's

18:22.702 --> 18:25.405
unfinished business is that

18:25.438 --> 18:29.642
he wanted to be reunited
with your guys's horse.

18:29.676 --> 18:30.777
-John.
-GHOST NANDOR: John.

18:30.810 --> 18:34.080
Right. And now that
you've reunited them,

18:34.113 --> 18:37.717
they can move on from this world
to the afterlife.

18:38.885 --> 18:41.020
Farewell, John.

18:41.053 --> 18:44.324
Perhaps we will be
reunited again

18:44.357 --> 18:47.126
in the hereafter.

18:47.160 --> 18:48.695
Sob bekher.

18:48.728 --> 18:52.732
Yes. Good morning to you, too,
my friend.

18:54.301 --> 18:56.703
Good morning to you both.

18:56.736 --> 18:58.871
Mm...

19:02.742 --> 19:04.511
There, there.

19:04.544 --> 19:06.012
Hug?

19:08.815 --> 19:12.385
(whispers): I think
you just need a little updog.

19:12.419 --> 19:14.221
NANDOR:
Can we go get some now?

19:20.393 --> 19:21.494
Interesting choice
for the walls.

19:21.528 --> 19:22.895
It's not how I would do it.

19:22.929 --> 19:24.464
-NADJA: Hello, darling.
-Hello, my darling.

19:24.497 --> 19:26.466
-What have you got there?
-Oh... (stammers)

19:26.499 --> 19:29.035
Nothing, really, just a little
dolly I thought might

19:29.068 --> 19:31.471
-cuten up the place. (chuckles)
-What a charming addition.

19:31.504 --> 19:32.672
So, where is your ghost?

19:32.705 --> 19:35.308
Oh, he, uh, he's moved on,

19:35.342 --> 19:36.876
to the next world.

19:36.909 --> 19:39.178
Did you helped him finish
his unfinished business?

19:40.213 --> 19:42.382
-Yes.
-Good.

19:42.415 --> 19:44.651
-I'm gonna show her around.
-Ah, ha, ha.

19:44.684 --> 19:48.187
-(squishes)
-Ugh, what is all this
sticky stuff?

19:48.221 --> 19:50.022
Oh, it-it's everywhere.

19:50.056 --> 19:52.024
Is it ghost ectoplasm?

19:52.058 --> 19:54.494
Yes, my darling.
That's exactly what it is.

19:54.527 --> 19:57.330
-Ghost ectoplasm.
-(moans)

19:57.364 --> 19:59.098

20:13.079 --> 20:15.214
-Colin.
-Hi, Grandma.

20:15.248 --> 20:18.685
You are such a big boy now.

20:18.718 --> 20:21.020
And even more handsome.

20:21.053 --> 20:24.424
It's probably because I have
so much updog.

20:24.457 --> 20:26.192
What's updog?

20:26.225 --> 20:28.395
Nothing much, dog,
what's up with you?

20:28.428 --> 20:29.962
(both laugh)

20:29.996 --> 20:32.565
-(snorts)
-Oh, Colin.

20:32.599 --> 20:34.801
You are such a stitch.

20:34.834 --> 20:38.438
-All right, then.
-So tell me, how is your life?

20:38.471 --> 20:40.473
I have missed so much.

20:40.507 --> 20:43.075
Uh, Grandma, I'm gonna be
honest, I'm pretty busy

20:43.109 --> 20:45.545
right now, so maybe we can
catch up another time.

20:45.578 --> 20:47.580
But there's so much
I want to ask you about.

20:47.614 --> 20:50.082
-Okay, got to go.
-Oh...

20:50.116 --> 20:52.118
Later.
(exhales)

20:54.120 --> 20:59.792
* Darling, I will miss you so *

20:59.826 --> 21:05.765
* When you have gone away *

21:05.798 --> 21:09.068
* Miss your kisses *

21:09.101 --> 21:12.939
* And fond caress *

21:12.972 --> 21:15.107
* Your haunting voice *

21:15.141 --> 21:19.245
* And your loveliness *

21:19.278 --> 21:25.151
* Darlin, I will miss you so *

21:25.184 --> 21:29.155
* Darling, I'll miss you so. *

Spirits, uncloak yourselves.

21:42.469 --> 21:44.804
-There's
no such thing as ghosts.
-Okay. Here we go again.

What the hell
is going on out here?

Ta-da!

-You've got 20 seconds
to decide-- arms or legs?

22:21.541 --> 22:23.209
Decide. Decide!

Mummy isn't here.
Try next door.

CHILDREN: Mummy!

22:44.631 --> 22:47.867
WOMAN: Oh, my God.
No, got the wrong house.

22:52.271 --> 22:54.707
Did you call
the speaker of the house
a four-letter word?

22:54.741 --> 22:56.075
-No.
-Are you sure?

22:56.108 --> 22:58.711
Yes, I'm sure.
"Ass" is a three-letter word.

23:07.153 --> 23:09.055
MAN: This is your station.

23:09.088 --> 23:12.191
But... what am I
actually doing here?

23:12.224 --> 23:14.026
I'm not gonna tell you.

23:14.060 --> 23:16.463
Don't worry.
You're gonna figure it out.
