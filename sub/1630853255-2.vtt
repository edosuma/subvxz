I don't want to be here either.

you want to say to me?

11:39.954 --> 11:41.355
You know who killed
the Aztecs, bro?

11:41.355 --> 11:42.690
I know fucking Cortés.

11:42.690 --> 11:45.159
Yeah, everyone says
you're real smart.

11:45.193 --> 11:47.829
But you're wrong.

11:47.862 --> 11:50.865
It was the other
Indigenous tribes.

11:50.865 --> 11:53.868
You see, they were so blinded
by their hatred of the Aztecs,

11:53.902 --> 11:56.370
they allied with the Spanish.

11:56.370 --> 11:58.406
Didn't realize they'd be next.

11:58.472 --> 12:01.042
If we spend all our time
hating each other,

Nothing. (clears throat)

13:25.059 --> 13:26.594
A history lesson.

13:26.627 --> 13:28.762
Don't forget your history.

Don't forget where the fuck
you're from.

Man, you got to lay down
the caulking and then the shims.

14:50.811 --> 14:52.746
I'm just checking to see
if your measurements are good.

14:52.813 --> 14:54.715
My measurements are good but you
still gotta lay down the shims.

14:54.715 --> 14:56.550
-I'm seeing if this fits.
-It's gonna fall if you don't...

14:56.550 --> 14:57.885
If you don't walk away from me
in three seconds,

14:57.885 --> 14:59.153
I'm gonna fucking murder you!

Yo, about to hit a meeting,
dawg. Are you down?

15:07.095 --> 15:09.563
Nah, I'm good. I'm straight

All right, dawg.
Well, if you ever do...

15:15.603 --> 15:17.905
Yeah, Creeps.
I know where to find you.

15:19.740 --> 15:21.709
Gilly, you dropped
something, dawg.

15:21.742 --> 15:23.277
I'll fucking drop you.

15:23.344 --> 15:25.279
(laughs)

15:28.182 --> 15:29.617
Shut up.

15:38.792 --> 15:40.261
Son.

15:45.266 --> 15:47.235
Somebody came looking for you.

15:47.268 --> 15:49.603
Sounds important.

15:49.637 --> 15:51.872
He left me this.

16:28.008 --> 16:30.278
Chibs wants him up in Charming.

16:30.311 --> 16:31.812
JOKER:
Jesus Christ.

16:31.812 --> 16:35.449
Happy'll hang low
and it'll all blow over.

16:35.483 --> 16:37.151
I told him that chick
was trouble.

16:37.151 --> 16:38.619
Her old man pressing charges?

16:38.652 --> 16:41.489
Nah, I got him straight.

16:41.489 --> 16:44.492
Happy's been fucked
ever since Montez bailed.

16:44.525 --> 16:46.194
Just like his fucking cousin.

16:46.260 --> 16:48.462
Start patching in day laborers,
what'd you expect?

16:48.496 --> 16:50.998
Montez is as much of a brother
as anyone in this fucking room.

16:51.031 --> 16:52.333
DOC:
That ain't true.

16:52.366 --> 16:54.802
If it was, he'd be
in this fucking room.

16:54.835 --> 16:57.838
Not out bad somewhere
doing God knows what.

17:00.341 --> 17:02.310
What's the latest with Packer?

17:02.343 --> 17:04.878
UC Davis--
supposed to be the best.

17:04.945 --> 17:07.348
The brothers up north
are keeping vigil.

17:08.349 --> 17:10.518
And the Mayans?

17:11.852 --> 17:14.822
I don't know how many more ways
I can spell it out for you.

17:14.855 --> 17:17.358
There ain't no appetite for war.

17:17.358 --> 17:20.194
Well, Happy specifically
fucking told them.

17:20.228 --> 17:21.862
But they still crossed
in our territory

17:21.862 --> 17:24.332
without a call
and left a fucking mess.

17:24.365 --> 17:27.201
So, tell me that's not
a very clear "fuck you."

17:28.202 --> 17:29.870
War is bad for business.

17:30.904 --> 17:32.740
Santo Padre's on their last leg.

17:32.806 --> 17:37.578
Shit, the whole club's
hanging by a thread.

17:37.645 --> 17:40.248
Let those spic dogs
eat each other.

17:41.249 --> 17:43.217
We'll feast on the bones.

17:56.730 --> 17:58.065
-(knocking on door)
-Come in.

18:01.735 --> 18:04.272
Normally people wait to hear
"come in" before they come in.

18:04.338 --> 18:07.375
(panting):
I'm not people.
I'm your brother.

18:07.408 --> 18:10.844
This was in your door.
Think it's from Pops.

18:13.914 --> 18:15.183
Bro...

18:18.085 --> 18:19.753
How long you gonna
keep icing him out?

18:20.954 --> 18:22.590
Stay out of it, Angel.

18:28.262 --> 18:31.965
(sighs deeply)

18:32.032 --> 18:34.268
You know there's an entire bar
in that clubhouse, right?

18:35.769 --> 18:38.138
Can't I just want to get
some quality time in

18:38.206 --> 18:39.773
with my little bro?

18:40.874 --> 18:42.276
Besides, man,

18:42.310 --> 18:44.144
everyone in there's all moody
and shit these days.

19:02.496 --> 19:04.131
How are things with Nails?

19:08.502 --> 19:11.339
Good. You know?

19:11.405 --> 19:16.310
She's, like, setting the house
all up for a baby.

19:16.310 --> 19:18.312
Bought a bunch
of expensive-ass shit.

19:18.312 --> 19:21.982
I don't have a fucking clue
what any of it does and...

19:23.150 --> 19:26.487
But... things are good.

19:28.422 --> 19:30.658
Yeah, we're good.

19:32.593 --> 19:34.995
(laughing)

19:41.335 --> 19:43.036
If you're gonna make it work...

19:45.005 --> 19:46.374
...like, actually work...

19:47.375 --> 19:49.677
...you got to let go, man.

19:54.282 --> 19:56.350
The past, man.

19:56.350 --> 19:58.786
You may have wanted something
else, but that shit's over.

20:00.354 --> 20:01.622
It's dead.

20:03.056 --> 20:04.224
And you got to bury it...

20:07.728 --> 20:09.697
...or it'll haunt you.

20:09.730 --> 20:12.700
What the fuck is wrong with you?
I just told you, we're good.

20:12.733 --> 20:13.734
You're tripping.

20:15.636 --> 20:17.037
(sighs)

20:20.874 --> 20:23.210
Why you even bother fixing that?

20:23.243 --> 20:26.380
Look at this place, man.
It's... sad.

20:26.414 --> 20:28.048
It suits me.

20:28.048 --> 20:29.717
-It's simple.
-Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

20:29.750 --> 20:31.352
I get it.

20:31.385 --> 20:33.721
Never getting laid
keeps things pretty simple.

20:33.721 --> 20:35.222
(laughs)

20:35.222 --> 20:37.891
Bro, at least put something up
on the walls or get a dog

20:37.925 --> 20:39.560
or-or get a fucking goldfish.

20:43.431 --> 20:45.699
This place is...

20:45.733 --> 20:47.267
depressing as fuck.

20:59.179 --> 21:02.182
(music playing loudly nearby)

21:22.470 --> 21:24.805
Can you turn it down a little?

21:24.872 --> 21:27.274
Are you serious?
It's almost 2:00.

21:28.376 --> 21:30.110
I closed last night.

21:30.110 --> 21:33.113
I spend practically every night
at Robert's house.

21:33.113 --> 21:35.282
The one time that I'm home,
you're gonna bust my balls?

21:35.315 --> 21:37.117
This isn't your fucking house.

21:37.150 --> 21:38.452
Hmm?

21:42.289 --> 21:43.290
Forget it.

21:43.290 --> 21:45.225
Already fucking forgot.

21:46.794 --> 21:48.796
(music playing louder)

21:48.796 --> 21:50.664
COCO:
Eventually think...
I'm thinking a twin turbo,

21:50.731 --> 21:53.333
maybe a new intake,
get that four-barrel carb.

21:53.401 --> 21:55.436
I got to take off the heads,
see how the...

21:55.469 --> 21:56.970
see how the cylinders look.

21:57.004 --> 21:59.440
Fuck this.

21:59.473 --> 22:00.941
-Where are you going?
-Going home.

22:00.974 --> 22:02.443
Oh, Hank's gonna be pissed off.

22:02.476 --> 22:03.644
Fuck Hank!

22:03.677 --> 22:05.779
Bro, you got to get straight
with the club.

22:05.813 --> 22:07.147
I would be straight
with the club

22:07.180 --> 22:08.482
and not on fucking probation

22:08.482 --> 22:10.651
if I didn't lie
to save your ass.

22:10.684 --> 22:12.352
Only reason
you're still here, dawg,

22:12.420 --> 22:14.988
'cause I covered for you
and your Meth Mountain bullshit.

22:15.022 --> 22:16.457
You looked out,
and I appreciate that.

22:16.490 --> 22:18.659
I mean, shit, you showed up
when no one else did.

22:18.692 --> 22:21.361
But that shit's behind me.
I'm straight now.

22:22.663 --> 22:24.765
Great, you can cover for me now.

22:28.436 --> 22:31.439
(barking)

22:49.623 --> 22:50.624
Hey.

22:52.860 --> 22:54.361
Hey, little guy. You okay?

22:54.361 --> 22:55.829
(clicks tongue)

22:55.863 --> 22:58.331
They're always confused
at first...

22:58.365 --> 23:00.400
waiting for their people
to come back.

23:02.235 --> 23:04.838
(barking)

23:04.872 --> 23:08.542
Then, one day they realize
no one's coming.

23:14.147 --> 23:16.684
They shut down.

23:16.717 --> 23:18.586
They shut off, to survive.

23:19.720 --> 23:21.922
Dogs aren't so different
from us, I guess.

23:21.989 --> 23:25.225
Just quicker to forgive,
given the chance.

23:30.397 --> 23:31.932
Sally.

23:31.999 --> 23:34.001
EZ.

23:35.569 --> 23:37.237
Short for Salomé.

23:38.271 --> 23:39.940
EZ's short for Ezek...

23:40.007 --> 23:42.242
If you're serious about her,
let one of the volunteers know.

23:42.242 --> 23:44.945
They can help you
with the paperwork.

23:50.417 --> 23:52.285
Sally, huh?

23:54.254 --> 23:57.424
WOMAN:
No, I just knew
she was up to something.

23:57.424 --> 23:59.593
I mean, why did she
suddenly start

23:59.627 --> 24:00.928
liking all my posts?

24:00.961 --> 24:04.231
-Yeah, well... Yeah, no...
-(beeping)

24:04.264 --> 24:07.267

echoing)

24:09.537 --> 24:11.539
(echo increasing)

24:13.140 --> 24:15.275
(rock music playing)

24:15.308 --> 24:17.444
Let me ask you something.

24:19.479 --> 24:21.281
Which one of these guys
have you been with?

24:21.281 --> 24:22.650
-(laughs)
-No. No, no, no.

24:22.716 --> 24:24.317
I'm serious.

24:24.384 --> 24:28.288
See, I-I just, I want to know
who wants to fuck Justin Bieber?

24:28.321 --> 24:30.123
(laughing):
Right?

24:31.959 --> 24:33.126
Right?

24:33.160 --> 24:34.995
Jess, can I have another one?

24:36.897 --> 24:38.231
Fuck this.

24:40.834 --> 24:42.335
Young boy, hold up...
sorry, young man,

24:42.402 --> 24:44.137
young man, come back.

24:44.171 --> 24:46.073
(laughing):
Come back.

*

25:30.217 --> 25:31.351
Ugh!

25:37.557 --> 25:41.194
And the look on her face.
The terror.

25:41.194 --> 25:44.197
I just couldn't believe
I could scare my baby that way.

25:44.197 --> 25:46.700
I never want to feel that again.

25:47.901 --> 25:49.469

25:51.404 --> 25:52.840

Hi, Neron.

26:14.261 --> 26:17.731
(sighs)
I've been struggling lately.

26:22.569 --> 26:24.237
I've done things...

26:26.740 --> 26:28.108
(hisses)

26:29.743 --> 26:34.081
(stammers) There's people
that I can't step nine to.

26:39.419 --> 26:40.788
That I can't...

26:46.259 --> 26:47.594
It's like...

26:48.762 --> 26:50.898
...sometimes we do these things.

26:50.931 --> 26:52.432
(chuckles)

26:52.465 --> 26:55.135
It-it ain't nothing to us.

26:55.202 --> 26:56.870
Shit we always do.

27:01.541 --> 27:03.143
But then...

27:04.778 --> 27:06.113
...sometimes...

27:09.449 --> 27:11.618
...those same things...

27:12.786 --> 27:14.487
...change someone.

27:20.160 --> 27:22.162
I saw it change him.

27:24.131 --> 27:25.799
I saw it change him.

27:29.636 --> 27:31.171
(breathes heavily)

27:31.238 --> 27:33.240
Was there something
wrong with him?

27:35.809 --> 27:38.746
Or, or was there something
wrong with us?

27:45.485 --> 27:47.487
(whispering): Is there
something wrong with me?

27:51.658 --> 27:53.293
Thanks, Neron.

27:53.326 --> 27:55.162
OTHERS:
Thanks, Neron.

27:56.997 --> 27:58.966

Keep coming back.

27:58.999 --> 28:00.500
It works if you work it.

28:09.376 --> 28:10.510
Hey.

28:12.112 --> 28:13.480
Um...

28:13.513 --> 28:17.317
I, uh, I just wanted
to thank you for tonight

28:17.350 --> 28:18.986
for sharing.

28:19.019 --> 28:20.187
It was really beautiful.

28:20.220 --> 28:21.822
(sighs)

28:21.855 --> 28:23.556
I'm all fucked-up right now.

28:25.959 --> 28:26.960
It was a mess.

28:28.361 --> 28:30.063
Life's a fucking mess.

28:30.130 --> 28:33.733
But you weren't afraid
to show that. It was brave.

28:35.702 --> 28:37.871
Plus, I couldn't take
hearing any more

28:37.871 --> 28:40.373
about Don's fucking cat.

28:40.373 --> 28:42.742
You know that's who he's
talking about, right?

28:42.810 --> 28:45.045
Every fucking week.
His fucking cat.

28:45.045 --> 28:46.046
(laughs)

28:46.046 --> 28:48.215
-For real?
-Yeah.

28:48.215 --> 28:49.549
I swear. (chuckles)

28:49.582 --> 28:51.418
(both laughing)

28:58.558 --> 29:00.894
Okay, well, this has, um...

29:00.894 --> 29:02.429
this has been
incredibly awkward,

29:02.495 --> 29:05.933
so I am going to put us both
out of our misery

29:05.999 --> 29:07.567
and go back inside.

29:10.770 --> 29:12.172
I appreciate it.

29:16.609 --> 29:18.411
You saying it, yeah.

29:23.016 --> 29:25.185
I just didn't think
I made any sense in there.

29:27.520 --> 29:29.122
It made sense to me.

29:32.960 --> 29:36.796
Maybe you've just finally met
your fucked-up match, Neron.

29:39.432 --> 29:41.634
(chuckles)

29:44.137 --> 29:45.138
All right.

29:47.107 --> 29:48.208
Bet.

29:50.210 --> 29:51.611
I like that.

29:52.946 --> 29:53.947
Bet.

33:50.550 --> 33:54.354
* So I'm working in the morn *

33:58.191 --> 34:00.327
(sniffs, grunts)

34:00.360 --> 34:03.963
* There's no heaven
on the field. *

34:11.904 --> 34:15.875
Doc, Chibs, they're coming
from a place of fear.

34:15.875 --> 34:18.211
They're old men, scared.

34:18.245 --> 34:19.579
Everybody's worried
about optics.

34:19.646 --> 34:21.714
Everyone's a fucking
businessman.

34:23.216 --> 34:25.185
What happened
to being an outlaw?

34:25.218 --> 34:27.920
Just get off it, man.
That shit's not gonna happen.

34:27.987 --> 34:30.723
Doc's right.
Whole club's about to fold.

34:30.723 --> 34:32.892
So what?

34:32.925 --> 34:34.861
We just let this shit slide?

34:34.894 --> 34:37.096
No, just let nature
take its course.

34:37.164 --> 34:39.732
Don't worry, man, that shit's
gonna work itself out.

34:50.743 --> 34:53.713
* I know you know
so very, very, very well *

34:53.746 --> 34:56.949
* Your body will be
like thunder *

34:57.016 --> 34:59.219
* Like thunder *

34:59.252 --> 35:01.588
* Yeah, I am wind *

35:01.588 --> 35:06.593
* Blowing through your hair *

35:07.627 --> 35:10.062
(singing along):
* Rest your head
out the window *

35:10.096 --> 35:13.566
* Let the wind blow
through your hair *

35:13.600 --> 35:16.936
* Yeah, I can't wait
any longer *

35:16.936 --> 35:18.971
* You got to know *

35:19.038 --> 35:21.073
* I am standing there *

35:21.107 --> 35:23.443
-* Rest your head
out the window *
-(knocking on door)

35:23.476 --> 35:26.279
* Let the wind blow
through your hair... *

35:26.279 --> 35:28.114
Fuck!

35:28.114 --> 35:31.218
Jesus, Ronnie. I've already
turned it down twice!

35:32.552 --> 35:35.988
* You got to know... *

35:38.558 --> 35:40.427
What the fuck
are you doing here?

35:40.460 --> 35:42.795
Can I come in?

35:46.466 --> 35:47.967
(turns music off)

35:49.969 --> 35:52.171
(sobbing): I'm having
a shitty fucking day.

35:52.239 --> 35:54.774
Please tell me Mom's dead.

35:54.807 --> 35:56.809
It's not Mom, Jaz.

35:56.843 --> 35:57.944
Something happened.

35:57.977 --> 35:59.812
(panting)

35:59.812 --> 36:03.182
I found something
and I don't know what to do.

36:03.250 --> 36:04.651
Well, is it red and itchy?

36:04.651 --> 36:06.486
Because, if so,
that's what you get

36:06.486 --> 36:08.988
for hanging around
those fucking beaners.

36:18.030 --> 36:20.667
(coughing)

36:20.700 --> 36:22.669
Jesus fucking Christ.

36:28.174 --> 36:30.277
Where did you get that?

36:37.350 --> 36:38.618
Hank?

36:41.120 --> 36:42.889
Come on in.

36:42.955 --> 36:45.692
-Thank you, ma'am.
-Please. Izzy.

36:45.692 --> 36:47.660
-MARCUS: It's my turn.
-(Tessa laughs)

36:47.694 --> 36:49.195
You're cheating.

36:49.228 --> 36:51.364
-You're cheating.
-Yeah, you're cheating.

36:51.398 --> 36:53.666
Oh, you're both against me now?
See, that's cheating.

36:53.700 --> 36:54.867
-Babe.
-That's not...

36:56.736 --> 36:57.904
Hank's here.

37:00.307 --> 37:01.240
HANK:
Sorry it's so late.

37:01.308 --> 37:03.410
Come on, kids.
It's time for bed.

37:03.476 --> 37:04.411
-TESSA: No, Mom.
-Tessa,

37:04.477 --> 37:05.845
-to bed.
-We're winning.

37:05.878 --> 37:07.547
You heard what your mom said.
She called it.

37:07.580 --> 37:09.882
You know what that means, right?

37:09.916 --> 37:12.352
Tomorrow we start
all over again, 0-0.

37:12.385 --> 37:14.053
TESSA:
You're a cheater.

37:14.053 --> 37:15.588
No, I'm a winner.

37:16.723 --> 37:19.692
-And you need to go to sleep.
-(Izzy chuckles)

37:19.726 --> 37:21.928
-Good night, Santi.
-Good night, Dad.

37:27.900 --> 37:30.770
Come on, guys.
Go... brush your teeth.

37:37.577 --> 37:39.512
(quietly):
I know.

37:40.580 --> 37:42.415
I got to go to work.

37:42.415 --> 37:43.783
Mm-hmm.

37:51.924 --> 37:52.925
Sit down.

38:03.135 --> 38:05.104
(sighs)

38:07.474 --> 38:08.608
How's it looking?

38:10.477 --> 38:11.611
It's complicated.

38:12.612 --> 38:14.280
Emotions are still
running real high.

38:16.483 --> 38:18.451
I need to know where
everybody's loyalties lie.

38:21.220 --> 38:23.790
You know what I'm asking, Hank.

38:23.823 --> 38:26.158
Am I going to have a problem
with Bishop?

38:31.731 --> 38:32.732
The brothers.

38:34.233 --> 38:37.470
They still... they still
look to him as a leader.

38:38.971 --> 38:41.007
Is he riling them up against
the other charters?

38:58.991 --> 39:00.159
The club...

39:03.262 --> 39:04.831
They're in a lot of pain.

39:08.167 --> 39:09.168
We need you.

39:11.370 --> 39:13.940
We need you to lead us back
to being whole again.

You got to be ready for war!

41:15.161 --> 41:16.896
Anyplace.

41:17.964 --> 41:19.298
The enemy is everywhere.

41:19.298 --> 41:20.800

Dos.

41:20.800 --> 41:24.671
-The enemy is everyone.
-Una, dos, tres.

41:24.737 --> 41:27.106
Una, dos, tres.

41:27.139 --> 41:30.810
Una, dos, tres. Una, dos.

Tres. Una...

Hey, hey.

41:45.191 --> 41:46.659
It's okay.

41:56.936 --> 41:58.337
It's okay.

42:20.459 --> 42:21.728
What's that?

42:21.794 --> 42:23.462
Picked up dinner.

42:24.731 --> 42:26.365

What is it? My birthday?

42:26.398 --> 42:28.534
Can't have you taking
all the credit.

42:28.534 --> 42:30.870
-That's my baby, too.
-(laughs)

42:30.903 --> 42:32.371
Wow.

42:34.373 --> 42:37.043
I should call you out
on your shit more often, huh?

42:37.043 --> 42:38.878
-Shut up.
-(laughing)

I'll go grab some plates.
