<i>Orson, Indiana--</i>

00:05.789 --> 00:07.096
<i>heart of the heartland.</i>

00:07.208 --> 00:09.289
<i>Proud home of Little Betty</i>
<i>Snack Cakes,</i>

00:09.408 --> 00:11.130
<i>the Demolition Derby</i>

00:11.260 --> 00:13.495

00:14.477 --> 00:17.032
<i>And this year, our little town</i>
<i>was turning 100,</i>

00:17.152 --> 00:21.012
the Orsontennial, and everybody
<i>was super-excited.</i>

00:22.649 --> 00:24.016
Don't answer it.

00:24.228 --> 00:26.218
You have to get it.
The machine's broken.

00:26.379 --> 00:27.468
Then <i>you</i> get it.

00:27.573 --> 00:28.865
I'm pooping!

00:31.765 --> 00:33.180
Hello.

00:35.062 --> 00:36.297
What?

00:36.416 --> 00:37.806
Oh, hang on. Sue.

00:37.927 --> 00:40.220
Did you sign up for
the Orson Float Committee?

00:40.821 --> 00:42.471
No.
Are they looking for people?

00:42.548 --> 00:44.140
Ooh! I'll do it!
I'll do it! I'll do it!

00:44.237 --> 00:45.082
I can totally do it.

00:45.193 --> 00:46.257
Please, please,
please, please, please!

00:46.324 --> 00:47.882
- I can be on it!
- Wait, what?

00:48.075 --> 00:49.559
Okay.
It's not for you.

00:49.633 --> 00:51.109
Wh--
I didn't make it?

00:51.184 --> 00:52.839
Is there an alternate squad?
Is there a waiting list?

00:52.918 --> 00:54.122
Ooh, is there a Clean-Up
Committee?

00:54.198 --> 00:55.979
'Cause I have Clean-Up-Committee
experience, you know?

00:56.083 --> 00:56.903
Okay. Hang on.

00:56.982 --> 00:58.158
Look, I-I-I don't know anything
about that.

00:58.249 --> 00:59.558
She's gonna have to
call you back.

01:04.248 --> 01:05.325
Hey.

01:05.441 --> 01:09.323
Did you sign us up for some
Orsontennial Float Committee?

01:09.450 --> 01:12.468
Yeah, right, that sounds exactly
like something I would do.

01:13.226 --> 01:14.387
Wait a minute.

01:14.694 --> 01:15.796
Hey, Frankie.

01:15.917 --> 01:17.397
How would you and Mike
like to drive a float

01:17.490 --> 01:18.956
in the centennial parade?

01:19.074 --> 01:21.312
You bet I would!
Hey, Mike!

01:21.483 --> 01:24.546
Nancy wants us to drive a float
in the centennial parade.

01:24.702 --> 01:26.062
Whatever, baby.

01:26.184 --> 01:27.435
Whoo!

01:28.405 --> 01:30.691
See, this is what happens
when we drink.

01:30.936 --> 01:33.225
We sign up for stupid committees
or get Brick.

01:33.434 --> 01:35.096
Mom, dad,
I'd like you to listen

01:35.227 --> 01:37.701
to my top 100 slogans
for the Orsontennial.

01:37.794 --> 01:39.154
What's the first one?
That's my favorite.

01:39.246 --> 01:40.285
What's this for, anyway?

01:40.379 --> 01:41.897
It's a contest
sponsored by the city.

01:42.007 --> 01:43.714
The winner gets to ride
in the parade

01:43.811 --> 01:45.191
on an old-timey fire truck,

01:45.300 --> 01:46.232
and the best part is,

01:46.321 --> 01:47.784
your motto
becomes the town's motto

01:47.865 --> 01:49.172
for the next 100 years.

01:51.070 --> 01:53.388
Orson--
100 years of fun.

01:53.485 --> 01:55.778
Orson--
you don't look a day over 99.

01:55.975 --> 01:58.777
Orson--
all-new people every 100 years.

01:58.912 --> 02:00.394
I got it!

02:00.529 --> 02:02.648
Orson--
100 years of moderate progress.

02:02.889 --> 02:04.228
Dudes!

02:04.310 --> 02:05.148
- Dude!
- Dude!

02:05.264 --> 02:07.581
- Yeah! The boys are back!
- Yes!

02:07.657 --> 02:08.561
Whoo!

02:08.658 --> 02:09.785
All right, yeah. Take a seat.
Let's get started.

02:09.877 --> 02:10.877
All right, all right.

02:10.971 --> 02:13.509
Okay, guys, been giving this
a lot of thought.

02:13.676 --> 02:15.865
There's no telling when Orson's
gonna have another centennial,

02:15.948 --> 02:18.893
so how's Boss Co. gonna make
some cash off this thing?

02:19.073 --> 02:20.620
Hey, we could be those guys

02:20.713 --> 02:23.136
that put all the cones out
for traffic and stuff.

02:23.329 --> 02:24.937
Yeah, I think the city
does that.

02:25.250 --> 02:26.808
We could pick up the garbage.

02:27.162 --> 02:28.468
The city does that, too.

02:28.682 --> 02:30.337
Man, the city is screwing us.

02:30.430 --> 02:31.954
Dudes,
we're not manual-labor guys.

02:32.043 --> 02:34.073
This is Boss Co.
With college knowledge.

02:34.168 --> 02:35.128
- Yeah.
- Oh, wait a minute.

02:36.121 --> 02:37.734
I got it.

02:37.860 --> 02:39.912
What's the one thing
Orson doesn't have?

02:40.051 --> 02:41.174
- Hot chicks.
- A shoe factory.

02:41.271 --> 02:43.271
A VIP experience.

02:43.484 --> 02:44.481
It's too equal here.

02:44.601 --> 02:46.635
It's like everybody's as good
as everybody else.

02:46.755 --> 02:49.304
We could bring exclusivity
to Orson.

02:49.631 --> 02:50.596
- I like it.
- Mm-hmm.

02:50.712 --> 02:51.522
Get some chairs,

02:51.638 --> 02:52.832
reserve a block
along the parade route,

02:52.934 --> 02:54.828
a-a velvet rope.

02:54.946 --> 02:56.140
My uncle's got some police tape

02:56.208 --> 02:57.635
from where they dug out
that foot.

02:57.821 --> 02:59.305
Yeah.
Let's do it.

02:59.413 --> 03:01.148
Boss Co. 2.0!

03:01.257 --> 03:02.761
Whoo. Yeah.

03:02.989 --> 03:04.503
Now, I'd like to start
by announcing

03:04.591 --> 03:06.779
the official name
of the parade.

03:07.009 --> 03:10.191
It's "Ehlert Motors
Presents The Orsontennial,

03:10.313 --> 03:12.014
Sponsored By Ehlert Motors."

03:15.934 --> 03:18.022
Mr. Ehlert, would you like
to say a few words?

03:18.643 --> 03:20.963
This is a buying opportunity,
folks.

03:21.110 --> 03:23.252
Remember,
for the week of the centennial,

03:23.451 --> 03:28.208
Ehlert Motors is rolling back
prices to 1913--

03:28.418 --> 03:29.838
plus 25 grand.

03:29.968 --> 03:30.991
Wonderful.

03:31.078 --> 03:34.196
Now, we need to make our 100th
a big success,

03:34.395 --> 03:36.488
and I've got
an exciting surprise

03:36.596 --> 03:38.594
which should really kick things
up a notch.

03:38.826 --> 03:41.267
We got Ron Cougar Mellencamp!

03:43.543 --> 03:44.448
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no.

03:44.669 --> 03:46.494
<i>Ron</i> Cougar Mellencamp,

03:46.612 --> 03:48.094
Indiana's number-four

03:48.204 --> 03:50.231
John Cougar Mellencamp
impersonator,

03:50.315 --> 03:51.590
according to Yelp.

03:52.752 --> 03:54.900
Okay. Everyone knows
their assignments.

03:55.056 --> 03:57.361
Let's break up
into our subcommittees.

04:01.289 --> 04:02.609
Hey, Nancy.

04:02.742 --> 04:04.202
Great speech.

04:04.424 --> 04:05.865
Listen, we don't think

04:05.983 --> 04:08.244
we should be driving a float
in the parade.

04:08.423 --> 04:09.480
What? Why?

04:09.582 --> 04:12.807
Well, it's just that when we
signed up, we were--

04:12.906 --> 04:14.173
- Drunk.
- Yeah.

04:14.324 --> 04:16.357
We weren't quite operating
with all our faculties,

04:16.452 --> 04:19.003
or, obviously,
we wouldn't have volunteered.

04:19.173 --> 04:22.209
But you two have been assigned
the Orson cow float.

04:22.361 --> 04:23.722
It's a huge honor.

04:23.868 --> 04:25.669
Plus, you did ask for it.

04:26.032 --> 04:26.938
We did?

04:27.036 --> 04:28.150
You want something simple?

04:28.262 --> 04:30.201
No way, Lady Liberty.

04:30.287 --> 04:33.495
We want the biggest float
you got!

04:33.611 --> 04:34.628
Ow!

04:37.664 --> 04:38.667
Mmm.

04:39.682 --> 04:40.976
Oh, man.

04:41.151 --> 04:42.845
You guys get to drive the cow?

04:43.079 --> 04:45.176
That's only the best float
in the whole parade.

04:45.335 --> 04:47.500
Lucky ducks.

04:47.908 --> 04:50.850
<i>And that's when we realized</i>
<i>100 years is a big deal,</i>

04:50.943 --> 04:52.791
<i>and we should be</i>
<i>doing our part.</i>

04:52.974 --> 04:54.587
<i>Plus,</i>
<i>Nancy brought brownies--</i>

04:54.693 --> 04:55.950
<i>the kind that are melted</i>
<i>on the inside,</i>

04:56.042 --> 04:57.440
<i>but the crust stays</i>
<i>sort of hard.</i>

04:57.514 --> 04:59.603
<i>It's like they're done,</i>
<i>but they're not done.</i>

04:59.718 --> 05:00.534
<i>What can I say?</i>

05:00.625 --> 05:02.338
<i>The woman knows</i>
<i>what she's doing.</i>

05:03.070 --> 05:05.670
Mom, I don't blame you for not
liking my previous mottos.

05:05.827 --> 05:08.492
They weren't personal, and they
lacked historical context.

05:08.655 --> 05:09.718
Hey!

05:10.115 --> 05:11.578
So, to that end,

05:11.821 --> 05:13.810
I went to the library
and did a little research.

05:13.964 --> 05:16.642
Now, did you know
that in the early 1800s--

05:16.730 --> 05:17.880
Yeah, skip ahead, Brick.

05:18.030 --> 05:18.950
Oh, okay.

05:19.046 --> 05:21.103
Uh, well, then,
in the early 1900s,

05:21.207 --> 05:24.056
a down-on-his-luck miner
named Merwin James Orson

05:24.165 --> 05:26.300
found an emerald while digging
on his property.

05:26.452 --> 05:27.655
Word spread quickly,

05:27.781 --> 05:30.217
and people came from miles
around to find their fortune,

05:30.330 --> 05:32.007
but turns out there was none,

05:32.132 --> 05:34.261
and it was a lawless community
for years.

05:34.328 --> 05:36.252
Prostitution was rampant,
but eventually,

05:36.359 --> 05:37.803
it became the town we know
and love today.

05:37.928 --> 05:39.623
So, what do you think
about this?

05:39.804 --> 05:42.325
Orson--
the heartland's hidden gem.

05:42.757 --> 05:43.844
Wow, Brick.

05:43.936 --> 05:45.327
That's actually good.

05:45.424 --> 05:47.114
I know, right?
I think I nailed it.

05:47.272 --> 05:48.480
It's melodious.

05:48.570 --> 05:50.755
It's got alliteration
with the nod to history.

05:50.895 --> 05:52.669
Old-timey fire truck,
here I come.

05:52.833 --> 05:54.648
Most importantly,
I think it'll put me

05:54.744 --> 05:56.293
in certain literary circles.

05:56.535 --> 05:57.543
Dinner!

06:04.785 --> 06:05.945
Hey!

06:13.202 --> 06:14.210
<i>Poor Sue.</i>

06:14.335 --> 06:16.122
<i>For weeks, she'd been trying</i>
<i>to get over Darrin.</i>

06:16.254 --> 06:17.941
<i>I mean,</i>
<i>he had a new girlfriend.</i>

06:18.132 --> 06:20.901
<i>So, she decided if this angel</i>
<i>person was right for him,</i>

06:21.071 --> 06:22.293
<i>she would move on.</i>

06:22.613 --> 06:24.235
<i>But she had to find out.</i>

06:24.339 --> 06:26.713
Hey.
You're... Sue, right?

06:26.828 --> 06:28.003
You're a friend of Darrin's.

06:28.213 --> 06:29.987
Yep. That's me.

06:30.244 --> 06:31.783
<i>Friend</i> of Darrin's.

06:31.989 --> 06:33.692
FOD.

06:33.795 --> 06:36.085
I'm so glad you're here.

06:36.186 --> 06:38.398
I've secretly been dying
to get my hands on your hair.

06:39.708 --> 06:41.900
Oh, cool. Thanks.

06:42.499 --> 06:44.431
Yeah, I'm just looking
for more of a style

06:44.524 --> 06:45.942
for the Orsontennial.

06:46.045 --> 06:47.520
Yeah, you really need one.

06:48.632 --> 06:52.483
So, how long have you and Darrin
been seeing each other?

06:52.588 --> 06:53.751
Oh, just a couple months.

06:53.928 --> 06:55.070
That's cool.

06:55.587 --> 06:57.493
So, like,
what do you like about him?

06:57.685 --> 06:59.910
Oh, you know, he's hot.

07:00.016 --> 07:01.411
Right.

07:01.673 --> 07:02.755
Anything else?

07:03.107 --> 07:04.304
I like his arms.

07:04.690 --> 07:05.868
Mm-hmm.

07:06.094 --> 07:09.257
That would sort of fall under
the "Hot" category.

07:09.395 --> 07:10.472
So...

07:10.664 --> 07:13.363
His neck.
He's got a sexy neck.

07:13.479 --> 07:14.727
And his stomach-- mm.

07:14.825 --> 07:16.917
Okay. We don't have to go
through every body part.

07:17.126 --> 07:20.394
Is there anything else you like
about Darrin?

07:22.327 --> 07:23.672
Uh...

07:23.779 --> 07:27.025
Oh, my God, Brad,
she is so wrong for him.

07:27.182 --> 07:28.293
I mean, obviously,

07:28.398 --> 07:29.763
she's a really talented
hairdresser,

07:29.896 --> 07:31.049
but that's not enough.

07:31.199 --> 07:33.165
Darrin deserves so much more.

07:33.260 --> 07:34.495
I know you're saying stuff,

07:34.624 --> 07:36.768
but I can't stop staring
at your hair.

07:36.879 --> 07:38.878
It looks amahz.
I'm so jel.

07:38.977 --> 07:40.690
Oh, you wouldn't believe
the looks I got.

07:40.787 --> 07:42.031
I wish I could do this myself.

07:42.147 --> 07:43.347
Totally.

07:43.527 --> 07:45.397
She doesn't appreciate him,
Brad.

07:45.629 --> 07:48.204
He is so much more
than his arms.

07:48.391 --> 07:50.483
He is a musician and a poet,

07:50.608 --> 07:53.147
and he can parallel-park
like nobody's business.

07:53.521 --> 07:54.964
You know,
I wouldn't be surprised

07:55.073 --> 07:57.159
if their whole relationship
is based on--

07:57.517 --> 08:00.164
excuse my language--
physical stuff.

08:00.265 --> 08:00.963
Mm.

08:01.058 --> 08:03.138
I mean,
is that all that men want?

08:03.368 --> 08:05.439
Is that really
what all men are like?

08:05.596 --> 08:07.107
Not the good ones, Sue.

08:07.490 --> 08:08.724
Not the good ones.

08:08.844 --> 08:11.355
Brad, I just don't
know what I'm gonna do.

08:11.433 --> 08:12.324
Well, <i>I</i> do.

08:12.437 --> 08:14.031
You need to make him know
what he's missing, Sue.

08:14.130 --> 08:15.664
You need to make him jealous.

08:16.186 --> 08:17.506
You're right, Brad.

08:17.938 --> 08:19.494
I'm gonna go for it.

08:20.161 --> 08:21.800
And you are just the man
to help me.

08:21.894 --> 08:22.988
Oh, I'm so in.

08:23.139 --> 08:25.280
And I know exactly what loafers
I'm gonna wear.

08:25.393 --> 08:27.073
- Can I Instagram this?
- Oh.

08:27.474 --> 08:29.367
♪Stunning.

08:31.649 --> 08:35.500
So, we got over 70 entries
for the motto contest.

08:35.638 --> 08:37.126
No, I'm sorry, seven.

08:37.219 --> 08:38.797
We got over seven entries.

08:39.010 --> 08:40.731
But when we saw this one,

08:40.950 --> 08:43.750
it's clear that a lot of thought
went into this.

08:44.260 --> 08:47.660
The winner
of the motto contest is...

08:48.035 --> 08:50.471
"Orson-- why not?"

08:50.556 --> 08:51.533
What?!

08:51.654 --> 08:52.749
Ooh! Oh, that's me!

08:52.818 --> 08:54.340
Oh, that's me! Oh!

08:54.592 --> 08:55.762
Thank you!

09:00.706 --> 09:02.007
Excuse me, Mr. Ehlert,

09:02.226 --> 09:04.748
there seems to be
some kind of mistake.

09:04.843 --> 09:06.635
I mean, "Orson-- why not?"

09:06.804 --> 09:08.459
What about "The heartland's
hidden gem"?

09:08.612 --> 09:09.582
We didn't get it.

09:09.753 --> 09:10.875
But I turned it in
the day--

09:10.964 --> 09:13.598
No, no, we received it.
We just didn't <i>get</i> it.

09:13.747 --> 09:14.802
"Why not?"

09:14.985 --> 09:17.529
Now, that's snappy.
It's like, "Got milk?"

09:17.644 --> 09:20.171
This is an outrage.
That is an inferior motto.

09:20.287 --> 09:22.423
And nobody said
we could use punctuation.

09:22.543 --> 09:23.251
Forget it, son.

09:23.349 --> 09:24.965
We're moving on
to the pie contest.

09:25.066 --> 09:26.211
- But it's--
- It's done!

09:26.316 --> 09:27.845
You lost.
Get over it.

09:28.032 --> 09:31.349
Now, I've got 35 pies to taste,

09:31.492 --> 09:34.844
so unless you're a pie,
get out of my face.

09:37.678 --> 09:40.875
Remember, Orsonites,
stay with your floats.

09:41.028 --> 09:43.645
I'm not naming names,
but some boys have been seen

09:43.772 --> 09:47.214
running around with egg cartons
and silly string--

09:47.332 --> 09:48.654
the Glossners.

09:48.849 --> 09:51.457
Now, sleep tight,
'cause Don's Oriental Food

09:51.565 --> 09:55.134
is providing free coffee
and crullers at 6:00 AM!

09:56.322 --> 09:57.765
You know,
I never thought I'd be excited

09:57.875 --> 09:59.094
about sleeping
out in the street,

09:59.191 --> 10:00.508
but this is kind of fun.

10:00.800 --> 10:01.768
How do you figure?

10:02.191 --> 10:02.793
Oh, come on.

10:02.911 --> 10:04.506
It's good for us
to get out of our comfort zone

10:04.629 --> 10:05.741
once in a while.

10:05.855 --> 10:08.031
And it's nice
to be giving back.

10:08.189 --> 10:11.050
I mean, think about how much
this town has done for us.

10:11.147 --> 10:13.143
Yeah. Well, after this,
we're even.

10:15.216 --> 10:17.143
It is weird, though.

10:17.246 --> 10:18.328
What?

10:18.495 --> 10:19.740
Just how long we've been here.

10:19.829 --> 10:21.784
That's a lot of years.

10:21.947 --> 10:23.412
And to think,
if it wasn't for that gas cap,

10:23.548 --> 10:25.838
we'd be living in Chicago
right now.

10:25.952 --> 10:27.422
Sure, blame it on the gas cap.

10:27.527 --> 10:28.816
It's true.

10:29.008 --> 10:30.664
We were so close.

10:30.760 --> 10:32.731
We were just outside
of Chicago.

10:32.863 --> 10:35.140
Everything we owned was packed
in that u-haul,

10:35.275 --> 10:37.308
and then we had to stop
at that gas station.

10:37.455 --> 10:39.535
Back then, you were
too good to pee in a ditch.

10:39.772 --> 10:42.385
And then you noticed
that the gas cap was missing.

10:42.484 --> 10:45.006
We had to drive all the way back
to Orson to find it.

10:45.101 --> 10:47.340
Hey, you can't return a rental
truck without a gas cap.

10:47.418 --> 10:49.247
They'd have charged us a fortune
to replace it.

10:49.351 --> 10:51.158
And then you ran into that guy
at the lunch place,

10:51.268 --> 10:52.770
your old friend
from middle school.

10:52.846 --> 10:54.292
What's-his-name
with the mullet?

10:54.427 --> 10:55.888
Rockin' Phil Nissen.

10:56.031 --> 10:57.729
Yeah, that's right.

10:57.870 --> 10:59.704
And then he told us about
that opening at the quarry,

10:59.840 --> 11:02.538
and... 20 years later,
here we are.

11:02.691 --> 11:04.651
Here we are.

11:08.053 --> 11:09.606
Can I tell you something?

11:10.018 --> 11:11.570
If it's that you love me
even more now,

11:11.672 --> 11:13.387
then, please, I'm listening.

11:14.761 --> 11:16.838
I didn't forget the gas cap.

11:18.537 --> 11:19.543
What?

11:19.683 --> 11:21.578
I didn't forget the gas cap.
I made that up.

11:22.862 --> 11:23.823
What are you talking about?

11:23.988 --> 11:25.548
Are you serious?
You're not serious.

11:27.269 --> 11:30.893
We were almost there...
and-- I don't know--

11:31.018 --> 11:32.618
it just didn't feel right.

11:33.138 --> 11:36.650
So you just made up a story
about a gas cap?

11:38.548 --> 11:40.123
Why didn't you talk to me
about it?

11:40.228 --> 11:41.450
I was scared, too.

11:41.538 --> 11:43.318
Why didn't you just tell me
how you felt?

11:43.422 --> 11:44.570
I don't know.

11:44.687 --> 11:46.176
I thought we'd have
a big fight.

11:46.284 --> 11:47.268
We were young.

11:47.355 --> 11:48.750
I wasn't so used to it then.

11:50.642 --> 11:51.792
Are you mad?

11:52.857 --> 11:54.577
Well, I'm always a little mad
but...

11:56.039 --> 11:57.384
...no.

11:57.475 --> 11:58.655
No.

11:58.977 --> 12:00.657
I'm glad we didn't
end up there.

12:00.744 --> 12:02.135
Chicago is so big.

12:02.228 --> 12:03.601
Who knows what would have
happened?

12:03.672 --> 12:05.257
Somebody would have ended up
on drugs.

12:05.619 --> 12:06.561
It might have been us.

12:12.073 --> 12:13.553
I'm glad we're here.

12:13.989 --> 12:15.296
It's a good town.

12:15.706 --> 12:16.847
It is.

12:21.783 --> 12:22.808
Rise and shine!

12:22.896 --> 12:25.017
Wakey, wakey, eggs and bakey!

12:25.214 --> 12:26.510
Happy 100th.

12:26.960 --> 12:28.294
Here's your walkies.

12:28.786 --> 12:30.498
It's showtime!

12:30.668 --> 12:32.807
Wait, why do we need
walkie-talkies?

12:32.916 --> 12:34.180
'Cause you have to communicate.

12:34.500 --> 12:36.783
Frankie,
you're his eyes and ears.

12:36.918 --> 12:38.725
He can't see a thing
back there.

12:38.891 --> 12:41.595
Now climb into your cow,
and let's do this.

12:46.451 --> 12:47.588
Oof.

12:48.182 --> 12:49.519
Okay.

12:50.161 --> 12:53.139
So, I just go through
this little hole to my area?

12:53.571 --> 12:55.913
No, that little hole
<i>is</i> your area.

12:56.891 --> 12:59.133
So, wait, seriously?

12:59.257 --> 13:00.515
This is it?

13:01.122 --> 13:02.240
Uh...

13:03.140 --> 13:04.297
Oh, yeah.

13:04.410 --> 13:07.055
Wow.
This is gonna be horrible.

13:08.107 --> 13:09.962
I'd be more comfortable
in a real cow.

13:10.050 --> 13:12.174
I still don't get why we need
walkie-talkies.

13:12.262 --> 13:13.463
I can yell at you from here.

13:13.536 --> 13:15.278
I've been yelling at you
for 20 years.

13:18.007 --> 13:19.307
Okay, I get it.

13:21.000 --> 13:27.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

13:40.932 --> 13:42.319
Come on down
to Ehlert's Motors!

13:42.456 --> 13:43.796
We'll make you a deal!

13:43.911 --> 13:47.214
And remember, you don't have to
plug our cars in to your house.

13:47.317 --> 13:49.985
Our cars run on good,
old-fashioned American gas,

13:50.093 --> 13:52.073
not foreign electricity.

13:56.955 --> 13:58.573
I can't believe this.
Not a single customer?

13:58.666 --> 13:59.745
No one is biting.

13:59.875 --> 14:00.916
Maybe they don't get it.

14:01.290 --> 14:02.628
I told you we should have
spelled out

14:02.718 --> 14:04.478
"Very Important People."

14:06.007 --> 14:06.882
Oh, hey.

14:06.974 --> 14:07.850
Excuse me, sir.

14:07.940 --> 14:11.621
How would you like
the VIP experience?

14:11.718 --> 14:13.813
Well, now,
why would I want that?

14:13.938 --> 14:15.465
Well, 'cause it's a way
to experience the parade

14:15.560 --> 14:18.464
in unparalleled style
and comfort.

14:18.609 --> 14:21.181
Oh, I wouldn't want folks
thinking I'm fancy.

14:22.776 --> 14:25.030
Can we get your e-mail address
for future events?

14:26.261 --> 14:27.272
<i>Brick was trying his best</i>

14:27.386 --> 14:30.089
<i>to put the motto-contest</i>
<i>disappointment behind him,</i>

14:30.241 --> 14:32.359
<i>but that was proving to be</i>
<i>difficult.</i>

14:34.623 --> 14:36.743
VIP seating right over there.

14:36.890 --> 14:38.074
Eat tiny sandwiches.

14:38.223 --> 14:39.645
Be better than your neighbors.

14:39.801 --> 14:41.663
Seats going fast.

14:47.251 --> 14:50.040
Left. Left.

14:50.172 --> 14:51.007
That's too much left!

14:51.123 --> 14:52.123
Right, right!
Right, right!

14:54.488 --> 14:56.187
No, no, no!
That's too far! Stop!

14:57.427 --> 14:58.860
Oh, my God, that was close.

14:59.278 --> 15:01.146
Why aren't you listening to me?

15:01.232 --> 15:03.789
I <i>am</i> listening.
I need more lead time.

15:03.893 --> 15:06.097
It takes more than a few seconds
to steer this damn thing.

15:06.178 --> 15:07.373
What the hell are you doing
up there?

15:07.461 --> 15:08.413
Well, I'm sorry.

15:08.531 --> 15:10.227
This twirler keeps dropping
her baton.

15:10.334 --> 15:12.146
We could have flattened her
like a pancake.

15:12.252 --> 15:13.500
Just tell me what you see.

15:13.633 --> 15:17.310
I see... Brad
with his arm around Sue.

15:17.630 --> 15:19.060
I always liked those two
together.

15:19.169 --> 15:21.628
Uh...
I can't feel my legs.

15:21.811 --> 15:24.301
I'm gonna get thrombosis.
I saw it on "Dr. Oz."

15:24.444 --> 15:26.257
You know,
maybe if I get on my stomach.

15:27.734 --> 15:29.961
Aah! Oh, oh, oh.
Worse, worse.

15:30.103 --> 15:31.302
So much worse.

15:35.878 --> 15:37.812
No. No, no, no!
What is this, Sean?!

15:37.919 --> 15:38.485
What?

15:38.620 --> 15:39.503
I thought we could
at least recoup

15:39.603 --> 15:40.844
a little of our investment.

15:40.935 --> 15:42.277
We paid to sit here, Axl.

15:42.480 --> 15:43.968
See?

15:45.136 --> 15:47.747
You can't do that. You let the dorks in,
it becomes the dork area.

15:48.598 --> 15:50.744
There's Darrin.
Let's do it.

15:50.896 --> 15:53.013
Are you sure?
In front of everybody?

15:53.093 --> 15:55.574
Trust me. Nothing makes a man
more jealous.

16:21.103 --> 16:22.384
Yeah, okay,
we got to get them out of here.

16:22.775 --> 16:27.087
And here comes an original
Orson fire truck from 1927.

16:27.211 --> 16:30.228
And riding atop, that's our
Orson motto contest winner,

16:30.345 --> 16:32.245
Kristen Rice.

16:32.401 --> 16:35.278
"Orson--
why not? Orson-- why not?"

16:35.389 --> 16:38.303
People, please.
Don't you see what's happening?

16:38.408 --> 16:40.430
This is the dumbing down
of America.

16:40.553 --> 16:43.434
We have to live with this motto
for the next 100 years.

16:43.558 --> 16:45.353
What will future generations
think?

16:45.537 --> 16:47.354
Do we really want this motto?

16:47.510 --> 16:49.703
Is this the legacy we want
to leave our children?

16:49.850 --> 16:50.871
Free t-shirts!

16:50.986 --> 16:53.476
Oh, sure, grab them up
just 'cause they're free.

16:53.607 --> 16:56.180
Just 'cause it's on a t-shirt
doesn't make it right!

16:58.677 --> 17:01.349
Shoot, I'm a sucker
for a good font.

17:01.543 --> 17:03.668
Curse you, Sans Serif.

17:03.820 --> 17:05.869
Sans Serif.

17:09.732 --> 17:11.723
Maybe we picked the wrong song.

17:11.829 --> 17:13.652
The song was flawless, Brad.

17:13.943 --> 17:15.958
I just have to face facts.

17:16.242 --> 17:17.934
Darrin's moved on.

17:18.413 --> 17:19.941
Maybe I should, too.

17:20.700 --> 17:23.616
It's just that I thought we were
so right for each other.

17:23.730 --> 17:24.508
I thought we could have

17:24.617 --> 17:26.973
the kind of relationship
my parents have.

17:27.050 --> 17:28.057
What do you mean you're trying?

17:28.146 --> 17:30.425
Just open your mouth and tell me
which way to turn.

17:30.567 --> 17:32.005
A piece of grass
has fallen down,

17:32.100 --> 17:33.431
and I can't see
where I'm going.

17:33.722 --> 17:34.624
Well, move it.

17:34.725 --> 17:37.639
I'm trying,
but my back is cramping.

17:37.721 --> 17:39.795
What are you complaining about?
You're three feet tall.

17:39.884 --> 17:41.130
Just scooch forward.

17:41.220 --> 17:43.348
Oh, yeah, says the guy in
the back with all the legroom.

17:43.559 --> 17:46.239
Ohh, yeah!
It's a big party back here.

17:46.453 --> 17:48.631
Oh, you had to get us
out of our comfort zone.

17:48.762 --> 17:50.039
We're old, Frankie.

17:50.169 --> 17:51.520
There is no comfort zone!

17:51.618 --> 17:53.363
Everything's uncomfortable.
Everything hurts.

17:53.455 --> 17:55.122
Yeah, if you didn't wuss out
at the last minute,

17:55.219 --> 17:56.863
we would be in Chicago
right now.

17:57.026 --> 17:57.910
Save it.

17:58.039 --> 17:59.167
You were practically crying
last night

17:59.301 --> 18:00.420
how happy you are here.

18:00.537 --> 18:02.521
Last night,
I wasn't stuffed inside a cow.

18:02.696 --> 18:04.769
I am never drinking
another Margarita again.

18:04.942 --> 18:05.817
You don't mean that.

18:05.982 --> 18:07.192
I know.

18:07.313 --> 18:09.138
This is Nancy Donahue's fault.

18:09.258 --> 18:11.798
She plies everybody
with booze and brownies,

18:11.914 --> 18:14.462
and then we all turn into
her little army of idiots.

18:14.566 --> 18:16.653
Why don't you stop
doing what she says?

18:16.786 --> 18:20.068
She acts like Queen Bee,
and you suck up to her.

18:20.197 --> 18:23.081
I mean, who gives a crap
what Nancy Donahue thinks?

18:23.196 --> 18:24.038
Me?

18:24.143 --> 18:26.345
What about you always trying
to act like a big shot

18:26.434 --> 18:28.058
around Bill Norwood.

18:28.187 --> 18:31.449
Yeah. Yeah, that's me.
I live to impress Bill Norwood.

18:31.576 --> 18:34.215
He's married to Paula.
He's got his own cross to bear.

18:34.324 --> 18:37.115
When this is over, I'm gonna
give Nancy a piece of my mind.

18:37.339 --> 18:39.657
- You won't.
- I know.

18:39.763 --> 18:41.636
Um... float operators?

18:41.730 --> 18:45.262
Please switch to channel 3
for all domestic disputes.

18:45.472 --> 18:48.178
They're listening.
Oh, crap on a cracker.

18:48.273 --> 18:49.501
Turn it off.
Turn it off.

18:55.298 --> 18:56.544
What the heck?

18:56.640 --> 18:58.289
Well, that was definitely
our fault.

19:01.578 --> 19:03.046
This is all your fault!

19:03.141 --> 19:04.831
I thought you said
you knew electricity!

19:04.931 --> 19:06.104
I didn't study that yet!

19:06.861 --> 19:07.967
Cut that cord!

19:08.110 --> 19:09.628
- I got it! I got it!
- Grab it, grab it!

19:09.746 --> 19:11.055
- Oh.
- Aah!

19:23.152 --> 19:25.146
Great!
Now everybody hates us.

19:25.244 --> 19:26.264
The whole town is mad.

19:26.359 --> 19:27.973
Look.
They're all yelling at us.

19:28.094 --> 19:30.067
Why is it so hot in here?

19:30.164 --> 19:32.193
- Fire!
- Fire! Out!

19:32.305 --> 19:33.340
Oh, my God!

19:33.492 --> 19:34.467
We're on fire!

19:34.753 --> 19:35.465
What?

19:35.566 --> 19:37.516
Mike, the cow is on fire!
It's burning!

19:37.633 --> 19:39.549
We got to get out of here!
Let's go! Let's go!

19:39.642 --> 19:40.640
Frankie, get out!

19:42.052 --> 19:43.289
Come on.

19:46.158 --> 19:48.237
- Aah!
- Gee whiz! Look at that!

19:50.357 --> 19:52.008
Sue, look out!

19:53.416 --> 19:54.407
Aah!

19:56.063 --> 19:57.152
You okay?

19:57.340 --> 19:59.073
Yeah. Thanks.

20:02.887 --> 20:04.727
Oh, my God!
Sue, are you okay?

20:04.812 --> 20:06.117
Did you see that, Brad?

20:06.282 --> 20:07.863
Darrin saved me.

20:08.130 --> 20:10.184
He saved me first.

20:10.525 --> 20:11.917
Do you know what this means?

20:12.351 --> 20:14.026
There's hope, Brad.

20:14.345 --> 20:16.098
There's hope.

20:20.670 --> 20:23.704
Has anyone seen
Ron Cougar Mellencamp?

20:23.796 --> 20:27.802
Does anyone have eyes
on Ron Cougar Mellencamp?!

20:27.902 --> 20:31.141
