03:11.930 --> 03:14.270
This global warming is killing me.

03:14.350 --> 03:18.350
This is too hot,
the Ice Age was too cold.

03:18.440 --> 03:21.440
What would it take to make you happy?

03:22.940 --> 03:25.110
This I like.

03:59.268 --> 04:01.978
Oh, no, you won't catch me.

04:08.358 --> 04:11.318
No running, James. Camp rules.

04:13.788 --> 04:15.618
Make me, sloth.

04:15.698 --> 04:19.038
Make me, sir. It's all about respect.

04:21.127 --> 04:22.747
Water ball.

04:22.837 --> 04:25.212
Sammy, you just ate. Wait an hour.

04:25.247 --> 04:27.757
Hector, no, no, no,
you can't pee-pee there.

04:27.837 --> 04:30.757
OK, there is fine.
Ashley, stop picking your...

04:30.837 --> 04:32.427
Pinata!

04:32.507 --> 04:35.717
Stop! You're supposed to wear blindfolds.

04:35.807 --> 04:37.727
OK.

04:37.807 --> 04:40.437
- Hey, it's my turn to hit the sloth.
- Mine.

04:40.517 --> 04:42.517
- Mine.
- Mine.

04:48.027 --> 04:50.656
Hey, you didn't have any candy in you.

04:50.736 --> 04:53.116
- Let's bury him.
- Yeah!

04:57.946 --> 05:01.036
Hey, whoa. Who said you kids
could torture the sloth?

05:01.116 --> 05:03.916
Manny, don't squash their creativity.

05:03.996 --> 05:07.916
Hey, Manny, Diego,
my bad mammals-jammals.

05:08.006 --> 05:10.126
Wanna give a sloth a hand?

05:11.676 --> 05:16.425
Look, I opened my camp.
"Campo del Sid". It means Camp of Sid.

05:16.505 --> 05:20.385
Congratulations.
You're now an idiot in two languages.

05:20.475 --> 05:25.145
Not in front of the k-i-d-z.
These little guys love me. Right, Billy?

05:25.225 --> 05:27.475
Don't make me eat you.

05:27.565 --> 05:30.775
They kid. That's why they're called kids.

05:30.855 --> 05:34.655
I told you, Sid.
You're not qualified to run a camp.

05:34.735 --> 05:37.485
What do qualifications
have to do with childcare?

05:37.575 --> 05:42.115
Besides, these kids look up to me.
I'm a role model to them.

05:43.574 --> 05:45.994
I can see that.

05:46.084 --> 05:50.584
You guys never think I can do anything,
but I'm an equal member of this herd.

05:50.664 --> 05:56.254
I made this herd, so you need
to start treating me with some respect.

05:58.054 --> 06:01.344
- Come on, Sid.
- Sid, we were just kidding.

06:01.424 --> 06:04.394
Hey, let's play
pin-the-tail-on-the-mammoth.

06:04.429 --> 06:05.934
Yeah!

06:06.474 --> 06:07.974
Sid!

06:08.064 --> 06:10.064
I can do stuff.

06:11.183 --> 06:14.193
Won't give me their stupid respect.

06:17.773 --> 06:19.363
I'll show 'em.

06:20.403 --> 06:26.243
And so, in the end,
the little burro reached his mommy.

06:26.323 --> 06:29.333
And they lived happily ever after.

06:32.043 --> 06:34.333
- Good job.
- Question.

06:34.423 --> 06:37.883
Why does the burro go home?
Why doesn't he stay with the rabbits?

06:37.963 --> 06:41.842
Because... because he wanted
to be with his family.

06:41.922 --> 06:45.302
He should go with the girl burro.
That's a better love story.

06:45.382 --> 06:49.012
OK, well, when you tell your burro story,
that's what he'll do.

06:49.102 --> 06:53.022
Burro is a demeaning name.
Technically, it's called a wild ass.

06:53.102 --> 06:57.812
Fine. The wild ass boy
came home to his wild ass mother.

06:59.192 --> 07:01.902
See, that's why I called it a burro.

07:03.362 --> 07:06.991
Could the burro have a grazing problem?
Then he'd be more relatable.

07:07.071 --> 07:09.581
- Boring.
- It's not believable.

07:09.661 --> 07:12.201
- Do burros eat their young?
- It's not a good ending.

07:12.291 --> 07:14.621
Sometimes I throw up.

07:15.251 --> 07:19.711
They lived happily ever after.
You can't get more satisfying than that.

07:19.791 --> 07:23.711
One big, happy family.
That's the way it's supposed to be.

07:23.801 --> 07:26.471
Where's your big, happy family?

07:31.261 --> 07:35.520
Then the hungry tiger
ate the pesky little kids.

07:37.480 --> 07:39.980
- You OK, buddy?
- Sure. Why not?

07:40.060 --> 07:42.610
- I thought...
- Story time's over. The end.

07:43.030 --> 07:45.990
- Run for your lives!
- Where's everybody going?

07:46.070 --> 07:49.160
- The world's coming to an end.
- What are you talking about?

07:49.240 --> 07:52.540
Fast Tony - he says
the world's gonna flood.

07:52.620 --> 07:55.330
Folks, I hold in my hand
a device so powerful,

07:55.410 --> 07:57.750
it can actually pull air
right out of the sky.

07:57.785 --> 07:58.830
Yeah, right.

07:58.920 --> 08:01.289
Gather round, gather round.

08:01.379 --> 08:03.879
Pardon me, do you have gills, ma'am?

08:03.959 --> 08:06.509
So you can't breathe underwater?

08:06.589 --> 08:08.929
My assistant here will demonstrate.

08:09.009 --> 08:11.469
Hey, I can smell the ocean.

08:11.549 --> 08:14.809
What are you doing?
I can't sell that now.

08:14.889 --> 08:17.809
You suck air through your mouth,
you moron.

08:17.889 --> 08:21.019
Through its design
and sturdy construction,

08:21.054 --> 08:24.149
you'll have plenty of air
for eons to come.

08:24.439 --> 08:26.939
Of course, results may vary.

08:27.779 --> 08:31.068
Why are you scaring everybody
with this doomsday stuff?

08:31.158 --> 08:33.988
I'm trying to make a living here, pal.

08:35.368 --> 08:39.578
It's my weather forecast. The five-day
outlook calls for intense flooding

08:39.668 --> 08:42.248
followed by the end of the world.

08:43.087 --> 08:46.128
And a slight chance of patchy sunshine
later in the week.

08:46.208 --> 08:51.008
Come on, don't listen to him. Fast Tony
would sell his own mother for a grape.

08:51.088 --> 08:55.677
Are you making an offer?
I mean, no, I would not.

08:55.767 --> 08:58.307
Haven't you heard? The ice is melting.

08:58.387 --> 09:00.727
You see this ground,
it's covered in ice.

09:00.807 --> 09:03.227
A thousand years ago,
it was covered in ice.

09:03.307 --> 09:06.067
A thousand years from now,
it will still be ice.

09:06.147 --> 09:10.487
Say, buddy, not to cast aspersions
on your survival instincts or nothing,

09:10.567 --> 09:13.867
but haven't mammoths
pretty much gone extinct?

09:13.947 --> 09:18.037
- What are you talking about?
- About you being the last of your kind.

09:18.117 --> 09:20.957
Your breath smells like ants.

09:23.916 --> 09:28.416
Be that as it may, when's the last time
you saw another mammoth?

09:29.506 --> 09:31.506
Don't pay any attention to him.

09:31.586 --> 09:34.596
Mammoths can't go extinct.
They're the biggest things on Earth.

09:34.676 --> 09:36.601
What about the dinosaurs?

09:36.636 --> 09:39.056
The dinosaurs got cocky
and made enemies.

09:39.136 --> 09:42.436
Look. Some idiot's
going down the Eviscerator.

09:42.516 --> 09:45.566
Please tell me that's not our idiot.

09:46.226 --> 09:50.895
OK, I'm gonna jump
on the count of three.

09:52.105 --> 09:54.115
One,

09:54.815 --> 09:56.025
two...

09:56.115 --> 09:59.575
Sid, don't move a muscle.
We're coming up.

09:59.655 --> 10:01.405
Jump! Jump! Jump!

10:01.615 --> 10:03.615
Jump! Jump! Jump!

10:03.705 --> 10:05.205
Sorry.

10:05.285 --> 10:09.045
Two and three one-thousandths,
two and four one-thousandths...

10:09.125 --> 10:11.795
Sid, what are you doing?
Get down from there.

10:11.875 --> 10:14.795
No. I'm gonna be the first
to jump off the Eviscerator

10:14.885 --> 10:18.254
and then you guys are gonna have to
show me some respect.

10:18.344 --> 10:21.514
The only respect you'll get
is respect for the dead.

10:21.594 --> 10:24.594
Come on, Manny, he's not that stupid.

10:25.644 --> 10:29.104
- But I've been wrong before.
- Geronimo!

10:32.734 --> 10:34.604
Hey, watch it.

10:40.444 --> 10:45.454
I can't breathe.
I think I just coughed up my spleen.

10:59.753 --> 11:04.633
- Diego, retract the claws, please.
- Right. Sorry.

11:04.723 --> 11:09.143
If I didn't know you better, Diego,
I'd think you were afraid of the water.

11:09.223 --> 11:11.773
OK, OK. Good thing I know you better.

11:11.853 --> 11:13.482
Guys.

11:13.562 --> 11:15.732
Fast Tony was right.

11:16.852 --> 11:19.482
Everything is melting.

11:44.091 --> 11:48.431
It's all gonna flood.
Come on, we gotta warn them.

11:48.511 --> 11:51.431
Maybe we can rapidly evolve
into water creatures.

11:51.511 --> 11:55.641
- That's genius, Sid.
- Call me Squid.

11:56.981 --> 12:02.401
This whole thing's a piece of junk.
I can't believe I live here.

12:03.901 --> 12:05.401
What?

12:10.990 --> 12:16.000
Forget reeds. I present you with this
revolutionary gizmo we call bark.

12:16.080 --> 12:21.420
- It's so buoyant, it actually floats.
- I'll show you something that floats.

12:21.790 --> 12:24.590
All right, it's your funeral.

12:34.220 --> 12:36.889
See? This is exactly
what I'm talking about.

12:36.979 --> 12:40.939
Giants balls of furry lava the size of
mammoths raining from the sky.

12:41.019 --> 12:43.779
Go suck air through a reed.

12:43.859 --> 12:47.239
Listen to him.
He's right about the flood.

12:47.274 --> 12:49.409
I am? I mean, yes, I am.

12:49.489 --> 12:54.079
Wait. You said there wasn't going to be
a flood. Why should we listen to you?

12:54.159 --> 12:58.209
Because we saw what's up there.
The dam's gonna break.

12:58.244 --> 13:00.209
The entire valley's gonna flood.

13:02.629 --> 13:06.418
Flood's real, all right.
And it's coming fast.

13:06.508 --> 13:09.588
Look around. You're in a bowl.

13:10.888 --> 13:14.888
Bowl's gonna fill up. Ain't no way out.

13:15.718 --> 13:17.893
What are we gonna do?

13:17.928 --> 13:20.598
Unless you make it
to the end of the valley.

13:20.688 --> 13:23.438
There's a boat. It can save you.

13:23.518 --> 13:26.478
- I don't see anything.
- But

13:26.568 --> 13:28.898
y'all better hurry.

13:28.988 --> 13:33.487
Ground's melting,
walls tumbling, rocks crumbling.

13:33.567 --> 13:36.577
Survive that
and you'll be racing the water,

13:36.657 --> 13:40.997
cos in three days' time,
it's gonna hit the geyser fields.

13:41.077 --> 13:43.077
Boom!

13:44.127 --> 13:46.747
There is some good news, though.

13:46.837 --> 13:48.877
The more of you die,

13:48.967 --> 13:50.967
the better I eat.

13:52.257 --> 13:55.757
I didn't say it was good news for you.

13:58.926 --> 14:02.686
He must have been
a real pleasure to have in class.

14:26.745 --> 14:28.375
Dam.

14:28.795 --> 14:33.215
All right, you heard the scary vulture.
Let's move out.

14:33.295 --> 14:35.795
Manny, you really think there's a boat?

14:35.885 --> 14:39.515
I don't know, but in a few days,
this place is gonna be underwater.

14:39.595 --> 14:42.595
If there's any hope, it's that way.

15:03.244 --> 15:05.414
Manny, let's go.

15:26.593 --> 15:29.158
Overturned glyptodont
in the far right lane.

15:29.193 --> 15:31.723
Traffic backed up
as far as the eye can see.

15:31.813 --> 15:35.353
And it looks like
there might be a fatality.

15:35.443 --> 15:37.403
I call the dark meat.

15:38.233 --> 15:43.613
Come on, everybody, let's go.
Come on, come, come, come. Get in.

15:44.493 --> 15:48.033
- Come on, Grandpa, come on.
- We have to go.

15:48.122 --> 15:54.122
Well, I'm not leaving. I was born
in this hole and I'll die in this hole.

16:00.962 --> 16:03.632
Do we have to bring this crap?

16:03.722 --> 16:09.052
- I'm sure there's crap where we're going.
- This was a gift from my mother.

16:09.142 --> 16:11.182
OK, keep it moving, keep it moving.

16:11.262 --> 16:14.062
Manny,
I just heard you're going extinct.

16:14.142 --> 16:18.061
Hey, if you ever master hygiene,
try working on sensitivity.

16:18.151 --> 16:23.651
- I'm not going extinct.
- Kids, look. The last mammoth.

16:25.491 --> 16:28.741
Well, you probably won't see
another one of those again.

16:28.821 --> 16:30.071
See?

16:30.161 --> 16:33.791
OK, one, two, three... Where is James?

17:12.279 --> 17:14.659
Stu. Come on, Stu.

17:14.739 --> 17:17.499
Let's blow this ice-cube stand.

17:18.959 --> 17:20.628
Stu.

17:26.128 --> 17:31.469
Folks, be the first in the valley
to have your very own mobile home.

19:45.184 --> 19:47.474
- Shut up, Sid.
- OK.

19:52.564 --> 19:54.894
Stop singing, Sid.

20:00.073 --> 20:03.743
Sid, I'm going to fall on you again
and this time I will kill you.

20:03.823 --> 20:07.033
OK, someone doesn't like the classics.

20:17.753 --> 20:19.843
What if you're right?

20:19.923 --> 20:21.923
What if I am the last mammoth?

20:22.003 --> 20:25.302
But Manny, look at the bright side,
you have us.

20:25.382 --> 20:28.762
Not your most persuasive argument, Sid.

20:32.852 --> 20:35.482
- Mammoths?
- I knew I couldn't be the last one.

20:35.562 --> 20:38.062
I felt it in my gut.

20:49.572 --> 20:51.741
Extinct? Come on.

20:55.331 --> 20:58.421
He's up by a couple of fifths,
ahead by a tusk.

20:58.501 --> 21:02.461
And he's beating Diego
as Diego's coming round the corner.

21:09.261 --> 21:13.181
Sorry. My stomach hates me.

21:15.731 --> 21:19.600
Well, don't that put
the "stink" in extinction?

21:21.310 --> 21:23.320
Nasty.

21:25.110 --> 21:27.150
Manny.

21:28.990 --> 21:31.570
I need to be alone for a while.

21:31.660 --> 21:34.450
You go on ahead. I'll catch up.

21:41.460 --> 21:44.340
One truly is the loneliest number.

21:47.919 --> 21:50.129
These work great.

21:50.929 --> 21:52.799
Cool.

21:53.929 --> 21:57.809
- Missed me, now you gotta kiss me.
- I'll get 'em.

21:58.809 --> 22:02.109
- Which end is up?
- I'd hide that face too.

22:02.479 --> 22:06.029
- Hey, ugly.
- I gotta sit on that.

22:10.699 --> 22:12.279
Gotcha.

22:18.998 --> 22:20.958
OK, I'm going in.

22:21.828 --> 22:24.168
- Sid.
- What?

22:24.248 --> 22:26.048
- Nice miss.
- Cover your side.

22:26.128 --> 22:29.008
- I felt some breeze in that one.
- Smile.

22:33.928 --> 22:36.348
- Out of my way.
- Hello.

22:36.888 --> 22:38.888
Over here.

22:40.518 --> 22:42.267
- Surrender?
- Never.

22:42.347 --> 22:44.057
Cool.

22:44.727 --> 22:46.227
Smoke them.

22:53.197 --> 22:58.287
If anyone asks, there were 50 of 'em
and they were rattlesnakes.

22:58.947 --> 23:01.997
- Here, kitty, kitty.
- Big mistake, you miscreants.

23:02.077 --> 23:04.577
Miscreants?

23:04.667 --> 23:06.957
Diego, they're possums.

23:10.376 --> 23:12.376
Retreat.

23:38.325 --> 23:40.995
I guess it's just you and me now.

23:52.965 --> 23:55.795
I knew it.
I knew I wasn't the only one.

23:55.885 --> 24:00.005
Everyone falls out of the tree now
and then. They just don't admit it.

24:00.095 --> 24:01.675
Wait. What?

24:01.765 --> 24:04.434
Some of us have a tough time
holding on to branches.

24:04.514 --> 24:08.604
It's not like we're bats or something.
We don't have wings to keep us up.

24:08.684 --> 24:12.894
And you were in the tree because...?

24:12.984 --> 24:16.404
I was looking for my brothers.
They are always in trouble.

24:16.484 --> 24:19.024
Brothers? You mean there's more?

24:19.114 --> 24:21.114
Sure.

24:21.904 --> 24:23.994
- There's lots of us.
- Where?

24:24.824 --> 24:28.204
Everywhere.
Under rocks. In holes in the ground.

24:28.284 --> 24:31.493
Usually we come out at night
so birds don't carry us off.

24:31.583 --> 24:33.753
Help! Help!

24:33.833 --> 24:35.833
Help!

24:40.043 --> 24:44.383
Well, shave me down and call me
a mole rat. You found another mammoth.

24:44.473 --> 24:48.183
Where? Wait a minute.
I thought mammoths were extinct.

24:49.853 --> 24:54.603
- What are you looking at me for?
- I don't know. Because you're a mammoth.

24:54.683 --> 24:59.232
Me? Don't be ridiculous.
I'm not a mammoth. I'm a possum.

24:59.312 --> 25:03.322
Right. Good one. I'm a newt.
This is my friend, the badger.

25:03.402 --> 25:05.452
And my other friend, the platypus.

25:05.532 --> 25:09.202
Why do I gotta be the platypus?
Make him the platypus.

25:09.282 --> 25:12.582
- This guy giving you trouble, sis?
- Sis?

25:12.662 --> 25:17.752
That's right. These are my brothers.
Possum, possum, possum.

25:18.252 --> 25:22.882
I don't think her tree
goes all the way to the top branch.

25:24.212 --> 25:27.221
Manny, brink of extinction's
a bad time to be picky.

25:27.301 --> 25:29.511
Hey, she should come with us.

25:29.591 --> 25:32.181
Are you insane? No way.

25:32.261 --> 25:33.811
OK.

25:33.891 --> 25:37.981
Manny wants me to ask you
if you'd like to escape the flood with us.

25:38.061 --> 25:41.521
- I'd rather be road kill.
- That can be arranged.

25:41.611 --> 25:46.191
Funny. Let me have a little word
with my brothers.

25:46.281 --> 25:49.281
Ellie, are you crazy?
We're not going with them.

25:49.361 --> 25:52.701
Look, we'll never make it in time
if we only travel at night.

25:52.781 --> 25:57.210
These guys can protect us out in the open.
What do you say?

25:58.540 --> 26:00.120
Why did you invite them?

26:00.210 --> 26:03.420
Cos you might be
the only two mammoths left on Earth.

26:03.500 --> 26:04.765
He has a point.

26:04.800 --> 26:07.800
Sorry, when did I join
this dating service?

26:07.880 --> 26:12.140
My brothers and I
would be delighted to come with you.

26:12.220 --> 26:14.510
If you treat us nicely.

26:14.600 --> 26:17.180
See that?
That's the total opposite of nice.

26:17.270 --> 26:19.940
Maybe we'll have a snack
before we hit the road.

26:20.020 --> 26:23.189
You want a piece of us? Let's go.

26:23.269 --> 26:25.069
Banzai!

26:25.149 --> 26:27.569
- I got 'em.
- Back! Back!

26:29.279 --> 26:33.529
You know the best part?
We're carrying diseases.

26:39.249 --> 26:43.039
OK, thanks to Sid,
we're now travelling together.

26:43.129 --> 26:46.839
And like it or not,
we're going to be one big, happy family.

26:46.919 --> 26:49.758
I'll be the daddy,
Ellie will be the mommy.

26:49.838 --> 26:53.758
And Diego will be the uncle
who eats the kids who get on my nerves.

26:53.848 --> 26:57.718
Now, let's move it before the ground
falls out from under our feet.

26:57.808 --> 27:00.728
I thought fat guys
were supposed to be jolly.

27:00.808 --> 27:05.018
I'm not fat. It's this fur,
it makes me look big.

27:05.108 --> 27:08.028
- It's poofy.
- OK.

27:08.108 --> 27:10.278
He's fat.

27:44.516 --> 27:48.606
Escaping the flood is the perfect time
to shed those unsightly pounds

27:48.686 --> 27:51.526
with Fast Tony's Disaster Diet.

27:53.396 --> 27:56.776
You, ma'am, you look
like a big, fat, hairy beast.

27:56.866 --> 27:59.866
How would you like
to lose a ton or two?

27:59.946 --> 28:01.536
Would I ever.

28:01.616 --> 28:06.376
Don't listen to him, Vera.
You're already thin as a twig.

28:06.456 --> 28:11.505
I also have the perfect cure
for your eyesight, my blind friend.

28:40.864 --> 28:42.864
We'll never make it at this pace.

28:42.944 --> 28:47.374
Ellie, it's OK, you can
lose the camouflage. You're safe.

28:47.454 --> 28:50.334
OK. Safe? Please.

28:50.414 --> 28:52.454
Crash, Eddie, you two go scope it out.

28:52.544 --> 28:54.754
- What you got?
- Perimeter all clear.

28:54.834 --> 28:59.794
- Roger that. One-niner, over.
- Roger, over, victor...

28:59.884 --> 29:01.754
- Guys.
- All clear.

29:08.303 --> 29:10.053
Hawk!

29:17.353 --> 29:20.773
- What are you doing?
- Playing dead.

29:21.273 --> 29:25.193
- Manny, why don't you do that?
- Because I'm a mammoth.

29:25.283 --> 29:27.663
But you'd do it for treats, right?

29:28.533 --> 29:30.783
Is he gone?

29:33.082 --> 29:35.162
You're safe. Get up.

29:36.212 --> 29:37.332
Man.

29:37.422 --> 29:41.882
If you weren't here, that hawk would have
swooped down and snatched me for dinner.

29:41.962 --> 29:44.632
That's how cousin Wilton went.

29:47.762 --> 29:50.052
Boy, I really feel for you. I do.

29:50.142 --> 29:54.432
I can't even imagine what it'd be like
to be the last one of your species.

29:54.522 --> 29:58.982
- I'm not the last one.
- You brave, brave soul.

29:59.062 --> 30:02.071
That's right. Don't give up hope.

30:03.571 --> 30:05.611
Ellie.

30:05.691 --> 30:08.531
Look at our footprints.

30:08.611 --> 30:10.871
They're the same shape.

30:11.411 --> 30:14.081
Well, how do I know
those aren't your footprints?

30:14.161 --> 30:16.201
Well, then,

30:16.291 --> 30:18.581
look at our shadows.

30:18.661 --> 30:20.961
We match.

30:21.041 --> 30:23.751
You're right. They're the same.

30:23.841 --> 30:26.011
You must be part possum.

30:29.180 --> 30:31.180
You wish.

30:44.270 --> 30:47.490
Diego, there are whole continents
moving faster than you.

30:47.570 --> 30:50.570
We gotta catch up with the others.

30:58.869 --> 31:01.209
Hey. Knock it off.

31:03.709 --> 31:07.549
Cry me a river, blubber-tooth tiger.
Have some fun.

31:07.629 --> 31:10.799
The ice is thin enough
without you two wearing it down.

31:10.879 --> 31:13.049
Diego, come on. The ice may be thin,

31:13.139 --> 31:19.019
but it's strong enough to hold
a ten-ton mammoth and a nine-ton possum.

31:41.368 --> 31:43.328
Mammal overboard!

31:57.637 --> 32:01.387
Ellie, get up.
If you play dead, you'll be dead.

32:01.477 --> 32:03.517
Look at me.

32:10.027 --> 32:12.067
Diego.

32:20.076 --> 32:21.446
Diego.

32:31.006 --> 32:33.216
Come on, Diego. Come on.

32:34.796 --> 32:37.506
This may sting a little.

33:42.153 --> 33:45.363
- What in the animal kingdom was that?
- I don't know.

33:45.453 --> 33:49.323
From now on,
land - safe, water - not safe.

33:55.333 --> 33:58.293
That was the bravest thing
I've ever seen.

33:58.373 --> 34:01.293
- It was nothing. I...
- It's not a compliment.

34:01.383 --> 34:03.423
To a possum, bravery is just dumb.

34:03.503 --> 34:06.473
- Yeah, we're spineless.
- Lily-livered.

34:06.553 --> 34:09.972
Maybe mammoths are going extinct
because they get in danger.

34:10.052 --> 34:13.062
Maybe you should run away more.

34:13.141 --> 34:15.431
Good point. Thanks for the advice.

34:15.522 --> 34:17.522
Happy to help.

34:18.391 --> 34:22.942
Do you believe her? "Bravery is dumb.
Maybe you should run away more".

34:23.022 --> 34:26.112
She's infuriating
and stubborn and narrow-minded.

34:26.192 --> 34:28.452
You like her.

34:28.532 --> 34:33.081
- I do not.
- Don't worry. Your secret's safe with me.

34:33.161 --> 34:35.831
- And so is yours.
- What secret?

34:35.911 --> 34:38.661
You know, the one where you can't swim.

34:38.751 --> 34:40.045
That's ridiculous.

34:40.081 --> 34:42.541
Fine. But we're living
in a melting world.

34:42.630 --> 34:47.130
You're going to have to
face your fear sooner or later.

35:46.269 --> 35:48.609
Almost there.

35:49.489 --> 35:51.859
- OK. Ready, Eddie?
- Set.

35:51.949 --> 35:53.949
Let's roll.

35:56.329 --> 35:58.488
Wait for me.

36:09.208 --> 36:13.008
No brakes. Gotta roll.
Meet you at the other end.

36:13.088 --> 36:16.008
So you think she's the girl for me?

36:16.098 --> 36:19.268
Yeah. She's tons of fun
and you're no fun at all.

36:19.348 --> 36:21.978
She completes you.

36:24.148 --> 36:25.687
Yeah.

36:25.767 --> 36:30.027
Hey, Manny. Can you pull back the tree
and shoot me into the pond?

36:30.107 --> 36:32.447
- No.
- Come on.

36:32.857 --> 36:35.157
You expect to impress
with that attitude?

36:35.192 --> 36:36.657
I don't want to impress.

36:36.737 --> 36:39.617
Why are you trying
to convince her she's a mammoth?

36:39.697 --> 36:43.367
Because that's what she is.
I don't care if she thinks she's a possum.

36:43.457 --> 36:47.837
<i>- You can't be two things.
- Au contraire, Man-fered.</i>

36:47.917 --> 36:50.587
Tell that to the bullfrog,
chicken hawk or turtledove.

36:50.667 --> 36:53.011
He's never gonna let up on you.

36:53.046 --> 36:56.676
It'll be easier on all of us
if you just go with it.

36:58.296 --> 37:00.641
So what do you want me to do?

37:00.676 --> 37:03.136
Pull the tree
and shoot me into the pond.

37:03.226 --> 37:04.811
I don't know.

37:04.846 --> 37:07.766
If you're too lame to do it,
we can get Ellie.

37:07.856 --> 37:10.566
No, no, no. No, I can do it.
I can do it.

37:10.646 --> 37:12.606
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Come on, come on.

37:12.686 --> 37:16.406
- Have you done this before?
- Only a million times.

37:16.856 --> 37:19.026
Farther, farther, farther.

37:19.696 --> 37:22.035
Perfect. Fire!

37:24.205 --> 37:26.575
Yeah! I can fly!

37:38.545 --> 37:40.295
Crash!

37:42.175 --> 37:44.725
Crash! Crash!

37:44.805 --> 37:47.395
- Crash, are you OK?
- What happened?

37:47.475 --> 37:50.434
- Manny shot him out of a tree.
- What's wrong with you?

37:50.514 --> 37:53.854
- He said he could do it.
- And you listened to him?

37:53.934 --> 37:57.314
Crash, whatever you do,
don't go into the light.

37:57.404 --> 37:59.564
Can I help in any way here?

37:59.654 --> 38:02.614
You've done enough.

38:03.154 --> 38:07.534
- Are you happy now?
- Crash, Crash, don't leave me.

38:07.614 --> 38:09.994
Who's gonna watch my back?

38:10.074 --> 38:13.664
Who's gonna be my wingman of mayhem?

38:13.754 --> 38:18.003
Who's gonna roll
in that dung patch with me?

38:18.083 --> 38:20.043
Dung patch?

38:20.133 --> 38:24.883
- Wait. My legs. I can stand.
- He can stand.

38:24.963 --> 38:28.683
- I can run.
- He can run. It's a miracle.

38:28.763 --> 38:30.763
Hallelujah!

38:37.023 --> 38:42.023
What can I say? They're boys.
They make my life a little adventure.

38:42.113 --> 38:45.362
You guys are so dead.
Thanks for embarrassing me.

38:45.442 --> 38:47.612
Not the face.

38:58.332 --> 39:00.672
Ellie, Ellie, me too.

39:00.752 --> 39:02.922
She's not half bad.

39:04.172 --> 39:07.672
Crazy and confused, but sweet.

39:07.762 --> 39:09.762
So?

39:11.301 --> 39:13.811
So what's holding you back?

39:16.141 --> 39:18.141
My family.

39:21.691 --> 39:24.271
You can have that again, you know.

39:24.361 --> 39:26.531
No, Sid, I can't.

39:27.861 --> 39:31.361
OK, OK, but think about it.
I mean, if you let this chance go,

39:31.451 --> 39:36.491
you're letting your whole species go
and that's just... that's just selfish.

39:43.080 --> 39:46.500
I think I'm starting
to get through to him.

39:47.630 --> 39:50.720
- Wait, wait. I got you.
- Slowpoke.

39:54.550 --> 39:58.640
- Need help?
- No, no. Just catching my breath.

39:58.730 --> 40:01.440
- You're stuck.
- I am not.

40:01.520 --> 40:04.190
All right, then, let's go.

40:05.819 --> 40:07.529
I can't.

40:08.189 --> 40:09.819
I'm stuck.

40:09.899 --> 40:14.529
Don't you think that picking them up
like this would be easier?

40:31.129 --> 40:32.759
Ellie?

40:55.448 --> 40:57.658
I know this place.

43:01.523 --> 43:05.533
You know, deep down,
I knew I was different.

43:08.113 --> 43:12.243
I was a little bigger
than the other possum kids.

43:12.333 --> 43:14.833
OK, a lot bigger.

43:16.623 --> 43:20.632
Now I understand why the possum boys
didn't find me appealing.

43:20.712 --> 43:26.632
That's too bad,
because as far as mammoths go, you're,

43:26.712 --> 43:29.052
- you know.
- What?

43:33.642 --> 43:35.352
Attractive.

43:35.432 --> 43:38.522
- Really?
- Sure.

43:38.602 --> 43:41.852
What about me is attractive?

43:43.982 --> 43:45.981
I don't know.

43:46.071 --> 43:48.321
Well, there's your

43:49.741 --> 43:51.861
butt.

43:52.621 --> 43:55.031
What about it?

43:55.121 --> 43:57.251
It's

43:57.331 --> 43:59.581
big.

43:59.661 --> 44:01.791
You're just saying that.

44:02.381 --> 44:05.341
No, no, no, I mean it.

44:05.421 --> 44:09.671
It's huge.
Biggest darn butt I've ever seen.

44:09.761 --> 44:12.721
That is really sweet.

44:12.801 --> 44:15.050
What a crazy day.

44:15.140 --> 44:20.480
This morning I woke up a possum
and now I'm a mammoth.

46:06.786 --> 46:09.496
Boy, Manny sure took a big leap
with Ellie today.

46:09.586 --> 46:11.916
Sure did.

46:12.006 --> 46:16.796
He stood on the shore of uncertainty
and dove right in. Splash.

46:16.876 --> 46:20.346
Kind of brave, huh?
The way he faced his fear.

46:20.426 --> 46:23.636
I wouldn't know.
Sabres don't feel fear.

46:23.726 --> 46:28.266
Come on, all animals feel fear.
It's what separates us from, say, rocks.

46:28.346 --> 46:30.855
Rocks have no fear.

46:30.935 --> 46:34.435
- And they sink.
- What are you getting at, Sid?

46:34.525 --> 46:39.405
It may surprise you to know
that I, too, have experienced fear.

46:39.485 --> 46:41.275
No. You?

46:41.365 --> 46:43.905
Yeah. Yes, as impossible as it seems,

46:43.995 --> 46:49.665
the sloth has natural enemies that would
like to harm or otherwise "kill" us.

46:49.745 --> 46:52.495
- I wonder why?
- Jealousy, mostly.

46:52.585 --> 46:55.545
But the point is that fear is natural.

46:56.585 --> 46:59.214
Fear is for prey.

46:59.294 --> 47:03.004
Well, then, you're letting
the water make you its prey.

47:03.094 --> 47:07.014
Just jump in and trust your instincts.

47:07.094 --> 47:09.804
You know, most animals
can swim as babies.

47:09.894 --> 47:15.894
And for a tiger, it's like crawling
on your belly to stalk helpless prey.

47:16.604 --> 47:21.064
But faster, OK?
Now, claw, kick, claw, kick.

47:21.154 --> 47:24.154
I'm stalking the prey. Claw, kick.

47:24.234 --> 47:27.153
I look back over my shoulder
to see if I'm being followed.

47:27.243 --> 47:29.573
And I'm breathing.

47:29.663 --> 47:33.083
And I'm stalking
and I'm stalking and I'm...

47:34.493 --> 47:38.873
- I'm falling.
- Correction. You're sinking.

47:38.963 --> 47:41.463
Kind of like a rock.

47:46.263 --> 47:49.053
Hey, do we do any special tricks
like roll over?

47:49.133 --> 47:52.223
Or do we just throw our weight around?

47:52.303 --> 47:54.062
Whoops. Sorry.

47:54.142 --> 47:56.722
I don't know my own strength yet.

47:56.812 --> 48:01.192
Ellie, do you realize that now
we have a chance to save our species?

48:01.272 --> 48:05.942
- Really? How are we gonna do that?
- Well, you know...

48:06.032 --> 48:07.902
Did you just...?

48:07.992 --> 48:11.822
I'm not a mammoth for five minutes
and you're hitting on me?

48:11.912 --> 48:15.622
I wasn't saying...
Not right now. In time.

48:15.702 --> 48:18.332
I was just saying that
it's our responsibility.

48:18.367 --> 48:19.712
What?

48:19.792 --> 48:22.581
All right, that came out wrong. I...

48:22.671 --> 48:24.751
You're very pretty, but we just met...

48:24.841 --> 48:28.211
Responsibility?
Just doing your duty? Is that it?

48:28.301 --> 48:32.301
Ready to make the ultimate sacrifice
to save your species.

48:32.391 --> 48:38.141
I got some news for you. You're not saving
the species tonight or any other night.

48:48.110 --> 48:51.990
- So, how did it go?
- Not bad.

48:57.200 --> 48:59.910
OK, let's go.
We travelled with you all day,

48:59.945 --> 49:02.580
now you're coming with us at night.

49:02.670 --> 49:04.830
But we can't see at night.

49:04.920 --> 49:07.130
Then enjoy the flood.

49:07.210 --> 49:09.920
I can't even look at him.

49:10.010 --> 49:12.010
Pervert.

49:16.759 --> 49:21.769
Making friends everywhere you go.
Just making friends.

49:45.828 --> 49:49.088
- Watch out, there's a stump.
- Not anymore.

49:50.878 --> 49:53.418
I thought we could walk together.

49:53.508 --> 49:56.138
Crash,
ask the mammoth why he thinks that.

49:56.218 --> 49:59.508
She said she thinks you're a jerk
and to go away.

49:59.598 --> 50:01.598
She didn't say...

50:02.518 --> 50:05.518
Look, maybe if we spend more time...

50:05.598 --> 50:09.608
Tell him that I need
a little personal space right now.

50:09.688 --> 50:14.607
- She said go jump in a lake.
- And possums rule.

50:14.697 --> 50:17.697
- I can hear her, you know.
- What do you want? A medal?

50:29.417 --> 50:31.627
Stop moving.

50:34.877 --> 50:36.797
Thank you.

50:44.516 --> 50:46.596
Manny, Ellie. Lock trunks.

50:49.436 --> 50:51.516
Now!

50:55.946 --> 50:59.486
Crash, Eddie. Grab on to that ledge.

51:04.866 --> 51:08.415
- Funny. Now what's your real plan?
- Just do it.

51:08.495 --> 51:10.535
- Bye, Eddie.
- Bye, Crash.

51:10.625 --> 51:12.955
- Bye, Ellie.
- Go now.

51:17.375 --> 51:21.095
I'm sorry if what I said before
offended you.

51:21.175 --> 51:23.715
What do you mean "if" it offended me?

51:25.015 --> 51:27.435
That it offended her!

51:27.515 --> 51:30.355
I mean that, that it offended you.

51:34.224 --> 51:36.894
- You just overreacted, that's all.
- What?

51:36.984 --> 51:39.854
- Take it back.
- There are other lives at stake here.

51:39.944 --> 51:42.234
- He's got a point.
- He's got nothing.

51:42.324 --> 51:45.194
- It was a misunderstanding.
- It was insensitive.

51:45.284 --> 51:48.074
- Apologize.
- Why me? She overreacted.

51:48.154 --> 51:50.414
- Just apologies.
- No.

51:50.494 --> 51:53.414
- Do it.
- OK, I'm sorry.

51:53.494 --> 51:54.954
What?

51:55.044 --> 51:57.544
- He's right. I overreacted.
- You mean...

51:57.624 --> 52:02.213
Not another word or I'll come down there
and push you over myself.

52:02.963 --> 52:05.513
I got it. I got it.

52:05.593 --> 52:07.593
I got it.

52:13.513 --> 52:15.773
Manny, Ellie, run! Run!

52:28.572 --> 52:32.122
I guess we finally
did something right together.

52:32.202 --> 52:37.252
Hey, don't mind me.
Just hanging off the edge of a cliff here.

52:57.311 --> 53:00.351
- Remember the good old days?
- Which good old days?

53:00.441 --> 53:03.941
You know. Yesterday, last week.

53:04.021 --> 53:09.491
Back when the trees went up and down
and the ground stayed under our feet.

53:09.571 --> 53:12.111
Yep. Those were the good days.

53:12.201 --> 53:16.661
Possums were possums
and mammoths were mammoths.

53:16.741 --> 53:19.201
- We should get some sleep.
- Yeah.

53:19.291 --> 53:24.290
Tomorrow's the day
the vulture said we're all going to die.

54:38.948 --> 54:41.368
Wait a minute.

54:41.448 --> 54:43.958
Can I help you?

54:54.587 --> 54:57.587
Now, that's what I call respect.

54:59.797 --> 55:01.177
Nice.

55:07.187 --> 55:10.357
Somebody here likes Sid.

55:10.897 --> 55:14.896
Who is your decorator?
I mean, this is fabulous.

55:19.946 --> 55:22.576
Fire King.

55:28.536 --> 55:34.416
Fire King? Well, you know, it's about time
someone recognized my true potential.

55:34.506 --> 55:36.666
Let there be fire.

56:46.363 --> 56:49.203
If only the guys could see me now.

56:50.823 --> 56:54.123
This is either really good
or really bad.

56:56.123 --> 56:57.293
No, no, no.

56:57.373 --> 56:59.878
Me Fire King. Why kill Fire King?

56:59.913 --> 57:03.332
A thousand years' bad juju
for killing Fire King.

57:03.422 --> 57:06.462
Super-heated rock from Earth's core
is surging to the crust,

57:06.552 --> 57:08.882
melting ice built up
over thousands of years.

57:08.972 --> 57:13.052
You're a very advanced race.
Together, we can look for a solution.

57:13.142 --> 57:15.762
We have one - sacrifice the Fire King.

57:15.852 --> 57:18.812
- Well, that's not very advanced.
- Worth a shot.

57:19.642 --> 57:21.642
No! No!

57:37.741 --> 57:40.081
Bad juju!

58:01.560 --> 58:03.810
Water? Water!

58:09.440 --> 58:12.300
Crash, I told you not to drink
before bed.

58:12.335 --> 58:15.160
I didn't do this.
At least, not all of it.

58:15.240 --> 58:18.660
- What's happening?
- We overslept. We need to move.

58:18.740 --> 58:21.040
What if we're the last creatures
left alive?

58:21.075 --> 58:23.330
We'll have to repopulate the Earth.

58:23.410 --> 58:26.749
How? Everyone's either
a dude or our sister.

58:27.709 --> 58:30.549
Hi. Hey, Manny.

58:30.629 --> 58:33.589
Wow. What a night.
You'll never guess what happened.

58:33.679 --> 58:36.139
You were sleepwalking.

58:36.219 --> 58:39.809
No, no, no. I was kidnapped
by a tribe of mini sloths.

58:39.889 --> 58:43.179
- That was gonna be my second guess.
- And they worshiped me.

58:43.269 --> 58:47.479
I mean, sure, they tossed me into a
flaming tar pit, but they worshiped me.

58:47.559 --> 58:51.569
You were dreaming. Come on, the water's
rising faster than we're moving.

58:51.649 --> 58:56.818
I'm telling you, I was kidnapped.
I was worshiped. Guys.

58:56.908 --> 58:58.908
Fine.

59:05.708 --> 59:09.628
Can we slow down a little?
I'm dying here.

59:13.718 --> 59:16.178
It was just a figure of speech.

59:21.177 --> 59:25.017
They just sit there, watching us.

59:25.097 --> 59:27.937
I wish I knew what they were thinking.

01:01:01.154 --> 01:01:04.024
There. Now you know
what they were thinking.

01:01:09.574 --> 01:01:12.453
- Sid!
- What? It's catchy.

01:01:24.883 --> 01:01:28.553
- We made it.
- Yeah, we showed those scary vultures.

01:01:54.662 --> 01:01:58.952
It's just a little hot water and steam.
How bad could it be?

01:02:05.541 --> 01:02:09.421
I just did something
involuntary and messy.

01:02:10.471 --> 01:02:12.471
OK, come on.

01:02:13.511 --> 01:02:16.181
Manny. Get back.
It's a minefield out there.

01:02:16.261 --> 01:02:19.221
There's only one way to go.
Straight through.

01:02:19.311 --> 01:02:23.271
Straight through? We'd like to
keep the fur on our bodies, thank you.

01:02:23.351 --> 01:02:26.651
- We'll head back and go around.
- There's no time.

01:02:26.731 --> 01:02:29.401
The dam will burst before we make it.
We'll drown.

01:02:29.481 --> 01:02:31.951
If we go through this,
we get blown to bits.

01:02:32.031 --> 01:02:33.950
- We go forward.
- We go back.

01:02:34.030 --> 01:02:36.530
- Forward.
- Back.

01:02:36.620 --> 01:02:38.870
- Can I say something?
- No.

01:02:38.950 --> 01:02:43.830
- You are so stubborn and hard-headed.
- Well, I guess that proves it.

01:02:43.920 --> 01:02:45.920
I am a mammoth.

01:02:47.460 --> 01:02:50.710
- Come on.
- Fine.

01:02:50.800 --> 01:02:54.180
I don't know. Drowning sounds like
a much gentler way to go.

01:02:54.260 --> 01:02:57.850
Blown to bits sounds so sudden.

01:03:08.479 --> 01:03:11.609
He's going to get himself killed.
Manny, wait.

01:03:11.689 --> 01:03:13.439
Manny.

01:03:36.378 --> 01:03:39.178
Kids, look, the last mammoth.

01:03:39.258 --> 01:03:41.598
I just heard you're going extinct.

01:03:41.678 --> 01:03:45.308
- You can't be two things.
- She thinks you're a jerk.

01:03:45.388 --> 01:03:48.148
Where's your big, happy family?

01:03:48.228 --> 01:03:50.818
What's wrong with you?

01:03:50.898 --> 01:03:53.318
Manny, come on. We gotta go. Now!

01:04:00.577 --> 01:04:02.077
That way.

01:04:41.736 --> 01:04:47.746
Do not leave your children unattended.
All unattended children will be eaten.

01:04:51.915 --> 01:04:53.915
- Have you seen a mammoth?
- No, sorry.

01:04:53.995 --> 01:04:56.125
- Have you seen a mammoth?
- No.

01:04:56.205 --> 01:04:59.335
Possum? About 11 foot tall?

01:05:01.005 --> 01:05:04.385
- Hey, buddy, have you seen a mammoth?
- I sure have. Big as life.

01:05:04.465 --> 01:05:06.555
- Where?
- I'm looking at him.

01:05:06.635 --> 01:05:08.885
Not me.

01:05:08.975 --> 01:05:11.145
Poor guy doesn't know he's a mammoth.

01:06:10.703 --> 01:06:15.582
- I don't see her anywhere.
- Maybe she's already on board.

01:06:28.552 --> 01:06:30.552
Hurry, this way. Come on.

01:06:32.842 --> 01:06:36.512
- There it is.
- Ellie! Help!

01:06:45.151 --> 01:06:47.821
Come on, come on, run!

01:06:53.911 --> 01:06:55.911
Push.

01:06:58.621 --> 01:07:02.041
- You guys gotta go.
- We're not leaving you.

01:07:02.121 --> 01:07:04.581
- I'm not asking.
- Ellie, no.

01:07:07.131 --> 01:07:09.840
Ellie, don't worry.
We're going for help.

01:07:09.920 --> 01:07:11.760
Stay here.

01:07:26.310 --> 01:07:30.190
- Help us.
- Help! Somebody help.

01:07:30.280 --> 01:07:32.360
Manny.

01:07:32.570 --> 01:07:34.740
Manny.

01:07:38.449 --> 01:07:41.619
- Manny.
- It's Ellie, she's trapped in a cave.

01:08:42.057 --> 01:08:43.716
Ellie.

01:08:43.807 --> 01:08:45.807
Manny.

01:08:48.897 --> 01:08:52.357
- Help!
- I'll save you.

01:08:56.777 --> 01:08:59.066
Great. Who's gonna save him?

01:09:01.696 --> 01:09:03.826
You really need to brush.

01:09:09.076 --> 01:09:12.706
OK, OK, OK. Jump in now.

01:09:14.046 --> 01:09:16.506
Come on, 'fraidy cat. Come on.

01:09:16.586 --> 01:09:20.506
You can do this, you can do this,
you can do this.

01:09:20.586 --> 01:09:22.966
Trust your instincts. Attack the water.

01:09:23.046 --> 01:09:25.176
I am not your prey. I am not your prey.

01:09:25.255 --> 01:09:27.675
I am not your prey.

01:09:50.745 --> 01:09:53.243
Attack the water. Stalking the prey.

01:09:53.323 --> 01:09:56.874
Claw, kick. Even babies can do it.
Come on.

01:09:56.954 --> 01:10:00.964
Claw, kick, claw, kick.

01:10:01.044 --> 01:10:04.174
Hey. I'm stalking the prey.

01:10:10.054 --> 01:10:12.054
Eddie.

01:10:25.733 --> 01:10:29.693
You did it, buddy.
You kicked water's butt.

01:10:29.783 --> 01:10:33.203
Nothing to it. Most animals
can swim as babies, you know.

01:10:33.283 --> 01:10:36.533
Yeah, but not tigers.
I left that part out.

01:10:51.802 --> 01:10:54.762
There he is.

01:10:54.842 --> 01:10:57.262
Ellie, hold on to me.

01:11:29.171 --> 01:11:31.591
Manny, Manny, behind you.

01:12:08.580 --> 01:12:10.589
There they are.

01:12:11.669 --> 01:12:13.759
They made it.

01:12:24.269 --> 01:12:27.309
We thought we'd never see you again.

01:12:36.649 --> 01:12:38.818
We're gonna live.

01:12:42.448 --> 01:12:45.368
We're gonna die.

01:14:39.144 --> 01:14:40.859
Well, I'm not leaving.

01:14:40.894 --> 01:14:43.944
Grandpa, let go of the boat.
The flood's over.

01:14:44.024 --> 01:14:48.994
- This is my boat now.
- Come on, let's go. Come on, come on.

01:14:49.074 --> 01:14:53.164
Stu. We made it. We're gonna live.

01:14:53.244 --> 01:14:55.533
Well, I am anyway.

01:14:58.083 --> 01:15:01.003
I'm thinking about starting
a swim school.

01:15:01.083 --> 01:15:03.543
Sid's Squids.

01:15:08.463 --> 01:15:11.633
All hail Fire King.

01:15:16.853 --> 01:15:18.643
Hi.

01:15:22.692 --> 01:15:28.362
Fire King avert flood.
Join us, O great and noble flaming one.

01:15:31.652 --> 01:15:35.822
No, not so fast there, OK.
You make a quality offer.

01:15:35.912 --> 01:15:41.502
But Fire King has a prior commitment.
His herd needs him.

01:15:42.002 --> 01:15:48.252
He is the gooey, sticky stuff
that holds us together.

01:15:49.382 --> 01:15:55.221
He made this herd,
and we'd be nothing without him.

01:15:55.301 --> 01:15:58.931
- You mean it?
- Sid. Sid.

01:15:59.011 --> 01:16:01.931
That doesn't mean "want to touch".

01:16:07.561 --> 01:16:09.691
Don't ask.

01:17:10.039 --> 01:17:13.128
We're not the last ones anymore.

01:17:18.048 --> 01:17:20.048
You're not coming?

01:17:20.138 --> 01:17:22.388
You wanna go with them?

01:17:22.468 --> 01:17:24.638
I am a mammoth.

01:17:24.718 --> 01:17:27.348
I should probably be with a mammoth.

01:17:27.438 --> 01:17:29.938
Don't you think?

01:17:30.018 --> 01:17:32.018
Yeah, unless...

01:17:33.818 --> 01:17:35.818
Unless?

01:17:37.358 --> 01:17:39.698
Unless I...

01:17:42.157 --> 01:17:44.987
I just wanna say...

01:17:45.907 --> 01:17:48.247
I need to tell you...

01:17:50.037 --> 01:17:53.957
I hope you find everything
you're looking for.

01:17:57.337 --> 01:17:59.337
You too.

01:18:33.666 --> 01:18:39.545
Manny, you've come a long way since we
met and I'll take full credit for that,

01:18:39.625 --> 01:18:44.635
but you need to let go of the past
so you can have a future.

01:18:48.675 --> 01:18:51.635
- Go after her.
- It's OK.

01:18:52.555 --> 01:18:54.805
We'll always be here for you.

01:18:55.515 --> 01:18:59.355
- I'll keep in touch.
- Yeah, yeah. You're a good friend.

01:18:59.435 --> 01:19:02.105
Point made. Now, go on. Scat.

01:19:08.324 --> 01:19:11.364
Our Manny's growing up.

01:19:11.954 --> 01:19:14.874
Ellie! Ellie!

01:19:19.164 --> 01:19:21.164
Manny.

01:19:22.674 --> 01:19:26.714
Ellie, I don't want us
to be together because we have to.

01:19:26.794 --> 01:19:29.424
I want us to be together
because we want to.

01:19:29.514 --> 01:19:31.673
And I wanna be with you, Ellie.

01:19:33.383 --> 01:19:38.143
- What do you say?
- Manny, I thought you were going...

01:19:42.143 --> 01:19:44.563
You're possum enough for me.

01:19:58.792 --> 01:20:04.672
Well, it's just you and me now.
Two bachelors knocking about in the wild.

01:20:05.082 --> 01:20:07.422
Fine. But I'm not gonna carry you.

01:20:07.502 --> 01:20:12.222
- I still have my pride, you know.
- Come on, buddy, for old time's sake.

01:20:12.302 --> 01:20:14.802
I'll carry him.

01:20:16.342 --> 01:20:19.262
- But your herd's leaving.
- We are now.

01:20:19.352 --> 01:20:20.812
Shotgun!

01:20:23.062 --> 01:20:25.771
Manny, who do you like better?
Me or Diego?

01:20:25.851 --> 01:20:29.151
- Diego. It's not even close.
- Told you.

01:20:29.231 --> 01:20:32.151
Manny, you can't choose
between your kids.

01:20:32.241 --> 01:20:35.281
He's not my kid. Not even my dog.

01:20:35.361 --> 01:20:37.956
If I had a dog and my dog had a kid...

01:20:37.991 --> 01:20:40.621
and the dog's kid had a pet,
that would be Sid.

01:20:40.701 --> 01:20:43.291
- Can I have a dog, Manny?
- No.

01:20:43.371 --> 01:20:46.291
- Ellie, can I have a dog?
- Of course you can, sweetie.

01:20:46.371 --> 01:20:49.881
Ellie,
we have to be consistent with him.

01:23:09.136 --> 01:23:11.475
I saved you, little buddy.

01:23:23.865 --> 01:23:27.905
Calm down.
I saved you, little buddy. Remember?
