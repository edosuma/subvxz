00:00.634 --> 00:05.137
Kara: <i> When I was a child,</i>
<i> my planet Krypton was dying.</i>

00:05.139 --> 00:08.340
<i> I was sent to earth</i>
<i> to protect my cousin.</i>

00:08.342 --> 00:10.242
<i> But my pod got</i>
<i> knocked off-course</i>

00:10.244 --> 00:11.977
<i> and by the time I got here,</i>

00:11.979 --> 00:16.081
<i> my cousin</i>
<i> had already grown up</i>
<i> and become Superman.</i>

00:16.083 --> 00:17.950
<i> And so I hide my powers</i>

00:17.952 --> 00:22.588
<i> until recently</i>
<i> when an accident forced me</i>
<i> to reveal myself to the world.</i>

00:22.590 --> 00:26.058
<i> To most people</i>
<i> I'm an assistant</i>
<i> at catco worldwide media.</i>

00:26.060 --> 00:29.762
<i> But in secret, I work with my</i>
<i> adoptive sister for the deo</i>

00:29.764 --> 00:31.630
<i> to protect my city</i>
<i> from alien life</i>

00:31.632 --> 00:34.099
<i> and anyone else</i>
<i> that means to cause it harm.</i>

00:35.569 --> 00:38.103
<i> I am Supergirl.</i>

00:38.105 --> 00:39.671
James:
<i> Previously on</i> Supergirl...

00:39.673 --> 00:42.341
<i> We need to rely on ourselves,</i>
<i> not aliens in capes.</i>

00:42.343 --> 00:45.110
General Lane. What can I do
for army intelligence?

00:45.112 --> 00:46.678
Hank henshaw: I made
your father a promise,

00:46.680 --> 00:49.348
that I would take care
of his daughter.

00:49.350 --> 00:52.518
My name is j'onn j'onzz.

00:54.288 --> 00:56.121
Thank you, Supergirl.

00:56.123 --> 00:57.456
Astra: My dear niece.

00:57.458 --> 00:59.324
Did you really think
this was over?

00:59.326 --> 01:00.759
Astra is your family.

01:00.761 --> 01:02.828
And I think
you still care about her.

01:02.830 --> 01:05.631
Your mother signed the death
warrants of our entire race

01:05.633 --> 01:06.665
I don't believe you.

01:06.667 --> 01:08.400
Lord technologies
is under attack.

01:09.603 --> 01:10.836
You're non.

01:10.838 --> 01:12.237
Astra's husband.

01:41.068 --> 01:42.568
(Supergirl groans)

01:50.244 --> 01:52.311
Astra was wrong about you.

01:52.313 --> 01:54.546
You're as weak as any human.

02:01.689 --> 02:02.821
Alex: Let him go!

02:15.703 --> 02:17.536
I'm sorry
i couldn't stop them.

02:18.305 --> 02:19.838
Stay away from up there.

02:21.775 --> 02:23.075
Max,

02:23.077 --> 02:24.510
we need to secure the area.

02:24.512 --> 02:26.345
This is an active crime scene.

02:26.347 --> 02:29.748
No, this is my property.

02:29.750 --> 02:32.151
Alex: This attack
has been traumatic
for all of us.

02:32.153 --> 02:34.119
They kidnapped
my commanding officer.

02:34.121 --> 02:37.623
I think the days
of us partnering up are over,
agent danvers.

02:39.393 --> 02:43.195
At least tell me
what the aliens
were looking for.

02:43.197 --> 02:45.230
They could least
help us locate our man.

02:45.232 --> 02:47.499
Why don't you ask
your pet alien?

02:47.501 --> 02:50.769
As for me,
I'll protect myself
in the future.

02:50.771 --> 02:53.939
Now, get your jackboots
off my grounds.

03:06.854 --> 03:09.188
-Supergirl:
Who's in charge now?
-I don't know.

03:09.190 --> 03:11.723
Hank classified
the line of succession.

03:11.725 --> 03:13.926
We're implementing
the emergency protocols now.

03:14.962 --> 03:17.362
Agent danvers.
Look.

03:20.868 --> 03:23.035
You two really did
bury the hatchet, didn't you?

03:23.037 --> 03:26.104
I want every satellite we have
pointed at this city.

03:26.106 --> 03:27.706
Scan it block by block.

03:27.708 --> 03:30.442
And I want status updates
every ten minutes.

03:30.444 --> 03:32.444
Yes, director danvers.

03:36.684 --> 03:38.584
(Gun cocking)

03:38.586 --> 03:40.385
Alex,

03:40.387 --> 03:43.255
you must be so upset
about losing Hank.

03:43.257 --> 03:45.290
He can hold his own.

03:45.292 --> 03:49.828
Unless he has superpowers
you're not telling me about,
we have to help him.

03:49.830 --> 03:53.131
Maybe I can get astra
to tell me why non took him.

03:53.133 --> 03:55.167
Do you have a better idea?

03:55.169 --> 03:57.236
Are you sure you're up for it?

03:57.238 --> 03:59.838
I saw how astra
affected you yesterday.

03:59.840 --> 04:01.340
Do we have a choice?

04:07.448 --> 04:09.648
Careful, little one.

04:09.650 --> 04:12.551
These humans are fond
of their kryptonite toys.

04:13.287 --> 04:15.354
Where did non take henshaw?

04:16.590 --> 04:18.090
I spent years in fort rozz.

04:18.092 --> 04:20.859
It's going to take
more than a stern voice
to scare me.

04:20.861 --> 04:22.828
Maybe I'll have
my cousin come down

04:22.830 --> 04:25.430
and the two of us
can force you to talk.

04:25.432 --> 04:27.432
Kal-El doesn't have
the stomach for it.

04:27.434 --> 04:29.935
He was raised on earth.
He might as well be human.

04:29.937 --> 04:33.472
You are the true heir
to the house of El.

04:34.775 --> 04:37.876
If you help me,
maybe I can help you.

04:37.878 --> 04:40.746
You're trying to manipulate
my emotions.

04:42.316 --> 04:44.449
But you're undermined
by your own fear.

04:44.451 --> 04:46.652
I'm not frightened of you.

04:46.654 --> 04:50.055
Not of me.
Of the truth I hold...

04:51.258 --> 04:52.758
About your mother.

04:54.762 --> 04:55.894
(Scoffs)

04:57.164 --> 04:59.598
This has nothing
to do with her.

04:59.600 --> 05:01.900
This is about
saving a man's life.

05:01.902 --> 05:04.236
My mother may not have been
the woman I thought she was,

05:04.238 --> 05:06.138
but I know
what you and non are.

05:06.140 --> 05:08.740
Are you so certain of that?

05:08.742 --> 05:11.543
Did non kill you today
when he had the chance?

05:13.113 --> 05:15.514
I ordered him to spare you

05:16.250 --> 05:19.017
because blood bonds us all.

05:19.019 --> 05:21.386
Those are empty words
coming from you.

05:21.388 --> 05:24.456
If they were,
you would not be alive.

05:26.427 --> 05:29.561
If blood bonds us all,
then why don't you just
tell me where henshaw is?

05:29.563 --> 05:31.530
Because blood does not
bond us to him.

05:31.532 --> 05:33.231
I couldn't disagree more.

05:33.233 --> 05:35.500
All life is bonded by blood.

05:35.502 --> 05:36.935
You speak
of your human family.

05:36.937 --> 05:39.104
The ones who have
caged me in here.

05:39.106 --> 05:41.406
You've done this to yourself.

05:44.311 --> 05:46.111
Then you have
chosen your side.

06:06.767 --> 06:08.967
Alura: <i> "Blood bonds us all."</i>

06:08.969 --> 06:11.570
That ancient proverb comes
from a time when Krypton

06:11.572 --> 06:14.906
was little more than
a wasteland of warring tribes.

06:14.908 --> 06:18.643
And although blood
is indeed a powerful bond
that can unite us,

06:18.645 --> 06:21.580
it can also blind us
from seeing the truth.

06:21.582 --> 06:24.282
The people of Krypton
choose not to see the truth.

06:24.284 --> 06:28.286
Your monstrous plan
would have deprived people
of their very freedom.

06:28.288 --> 06:30.389
You are deluded, sister.

06:30.391 --> 06:34.726
You cling to the belief that
people are inherently good.
But they are weak.

06:34.728 --> 06:36.895
I sought only
to give them courage.

06:36.897 --> 06:39.364
The courage
to save themselves.

06:39.366 --> 06:41.299
Non: You're wasting
your breath.

06:41.301 --> 06:43.335
She brands us terrorists

06:43.337 --> 06:46.004
while standing idly by

06:46.006 --> 06:48.273
as our world
faces annihilation.

06:48.275 --> 06:51.309
Your moral outrage would
be far more convincing, non,

06:51.311 --> 06:56.148
if so many had not died
as a result of your reckless,
delusional actions.

07:07.294 --> 07:13.365
You give me no choice but
to impose the maximum penalty
for your crimes.

07:13.367 --> 07:16.201
Lifetime imprisonment
in fort rozz.

07:16.203 --> 07:21.106
Very soon, alura,
you will realize that
you have not condemned us.

07:21.108 --> 07:25.076
You have condemned
the sons and daughters
of Krypton,

07:25.712 --> 07:27.646
including your own.

07:28.382 --> 07:30.849
Do you hear me, alura?

07:30.851 --> 07:32.984
You have killed your daughter!

07:32.986 --> 07:34.786
(Beaming)

07:40.594 --> 07:43.328
Maxwell: <i> I'd like to address</i>
<i> the rumors of an incident</i>
<i> at lord technologies.</i>

07:43.330 --> 07:45.397
Oh, this is going
to be ugly.
(Sighs)

07:45.399 --> 07:48.066
<i> We're the target</i>
<i> of industrial espionage.</i>

07:48.068 --> 07:49.801
<i> Thankfully,</i>
<i> there were no casualties</i>

07:49.803 --> 07:51.470
<i> and those responsible</i>
<i> have been apprehended.</i>

07:51.472 --> 07:54.239
<i> -Thank you.</i>
-James: He's covering
up the attack.

07:54.241 --> 07:56.775
What is he up to?

07:56.777 --> 07:58.376
Well, let me see
what I can find out.

07:58.378 --> 08:00.412
No way. No!

08:00.414 --> 08:01.947
Max lord is way too dangerous.

08:01.949 --> 08:03.982
Hey, I've dusted off
my press credentials.

08:03.984 --> 08:05.250
Let me just talk to him,
see what I can dig up.

08:09.223 --> 08:10.922
Cat: <i> I don't have</i>
<i> an attitude problem.</i>

08:10.924 --> 08:13.058
<i> You have a perception problem.</i>

08:13.060 --> 08:15.293
Ms. Grant's on her way up.
Okay, um...

08:15.295 --> 08:20.031
Um, today, we have to seem
really, really normal.

08:20.033 --> 08:22.567
Like, like not
just normal-normal,

08:22.569 --> 08:23.869
but super-normal. Only, no...

08:23.871 --> 08:25.804
-No super.
-Are you having a stroke?

08:25.806 --> 08:27.772
Is this what
a stroke looks like?

08:29.409 --> 08:31.710
Ms. Grant thinks
I'm Supergirl.

08:31.712 --> 08:33.044
-What?
-What?

08:33.046 --> 08:34.646
I will handle it.

08:34.648 --> 08:37.449
But if she sees us
acting weird,
it's gonna blow everything.

08:37.451 --> 08:39.451
I just need to
heat up her coffee...

08:39.453 --> 08:41.386
(Stammers) Maybe not on that.

08:41.388 --> 08:42.821
-(Pops)
-(All exclaims)

08:42.823 --> 08:44.422
-What do we do?
-Winn: That got everywhere.

08:44.424 --> 08:46.024
James: All right, all right.
Round 2, round 2...

08:46.026 --> 08:47.926
Good idea. Hurry.

08:47.928 --> 08:49.895
-(Stammers) I gotta hurry.
-Okay.

08:49.897 --> 08:51.029
Kara: Hmm.

08:51.031 --> 08:52.731
(Sighs)

08:52.733 --> 08:54.733
-This, um...
-(Stutters)

08:56.470 --> 08:57.936
Yeah, she's doomed.

09:00.407 --> 09:02.173
(Sighs) Oh, my god, thank you!

09:02.943 --> 09:04.242
(Clears throat)

09:04.244 --> 09:05.577
(Blows)

09:09.283 --> 09:14.686
Ms. Grant,
they were out of lattes,
so here's a coffee.

09:14.688 --> 09:20.292
Mmm. And here you are,
delivering it to me
like a normal, boring person.

09:20.294 --> 09:22.527
Well, that's what I am.

09:22.529 --> 09:26.264
I'm very boring
and really normal.
(Chuckles)

09:26.266 --> 09:30.669
So, um, I'll just get out
of your hair.

09:31.338 --> 09:33.171
Why?

09:33.173 --> 09:36.041
Have a building to leap
in a single bound?

09:37.311 --> 09:39.578
(Laughs)

09:39.580 --> 09:43.682
So, we're still
going with that joke?

09:43.684 --> 09:46.618
Which is great
'cause it's hilarious.

09:47.454 --> 09:50.121
Kara, there are many topics

09:50.123 --> 09:53.792
that I find appropriate
for humor.

09:53.794 --> 09:57.028
English cuisine,
black lipstick,

09:57.030 --> 09:59.764
but I will never make a joke
about a good story.

09:59.766 --> 10:01.800
Ms. Grant, I'm sorry
you think what you think,

10:01.802 --> 10:04.869
but it's not true.

10:04.871 --> 10:06.304
I'm not Supergirl.

10:06.306 --> 10:08.807
One time at a party,
Paul McCartney swore to me

10:08.809 --> 10:11.910
that he and yoko
were the closest of friends.

10:11.912 --> 10:14.746
He was more convincing.

10:14.748 --> 10:18.149
I just... I don't want you
to be embarrassed when
you realize how wrong you are.

10:18.151 --> 10:21.286
Fine. We'll just keep playing
this silly charade.

10:21.288 --> 10:22.721
You may go, Kara.

10:22.723 --> 10:25.557
I'm sure there's a phone
in need of answering

10:25.559 --> 10:28.893
or a plane
in need of catching.

10:29.663 --> 10:31.963
(Whooshing)

10:36.069 --> 10:37.602
Hey.

10:37.604 --> 10:39.270
I know you forget to eat
when you're stressed,

10:39.272 --> 10:41.806
so I stopped by
that food truck you like.

10:41.808 --> 10:43.541
The one in Chicago?

10:43.543 --> 10:45.143
You are my favorite person.

10:45.846 --> 10:47.379
(Computer beeping)

10:47.381 --> 10:50.148
<i> This is lieutenant non</i>
<i> of Krypton.</i>

10:50.150 --> 10:53.585
<i> We each possess</i>
<i> someone of great value</i>
<i> to the other.</i>

10:53.587 --> 10:54.953
<i> I propose a trade.</i>

10:54.955 --> 10:57.088
This is acting director
Alex danvers.

10:57.090 --> 10:59.224
Excuse me
if I don't take you
at your word.

10:59.226 --> 11:02.260
I need proof of life.
I need to hear
from henshaw himself.

11:05.632 --> 11:07.032
Hank henshaw:
<i> Director danvers.</i>

11:07.034 --> 11:09.401
<i> Congratulations</i>
<i> on your promotion.</i>

11:09.403 --> 11:12.170
I will bring you
back safe, sir.

11:12.172 --> 11:15.974
Which will only happen
if you do exactly as I say.

11:15.976 --> 11:18.109
<i> I will return</i>
<i> henshaw unharmed</i>

11:18.111 --> 11:21.312
<i> if you return</i>
<i> general astra</i>
<i> safely to me.</i>

11:21.314 --> 11:24.916
<i> You have 48 hours</i>
<i> or your man dies.</i>

11:26.586 --> 11:27.886
(Sighs)

11:36.396 --> 11:38.496
Now we know
why non took Hank.

11:38.498 --> 11:39.764
So, what are you gonna do?

11:39.766 --> 11:41.700
If I turn down the deal,
non kills Hank.

11:41.702 --> 11:45.170
If I go through with it,
i free a criminal
with the strength of you.

11:45.172 --> 11:46.337
(Sighs)

11:48.408 --> 11:50.575
General Lane...

11:50.577 --> 11:53.411
Well, pleasure to
see you again, agent danvers.

11:53.413 --> 11:57.282
Wish we could say the same,
and it's director danvers.

11:57.284 --> 11:58.983
Not anymore.

11:58.985 --> 12:02.887
I've been granted authority
over the deo
by order of the President.

12:03.623 --> 12:04.956
This feels like a coup.

12:04.958 --> 12:06.858
Nothing so nefarious.

12:06.860 --> 12:10.128
Considering the stakes,
Washington wants
a commander in place

12:10.130 --> 12:12.630
without any personal ties
to the hostage.

12:12.632 --> 12:15.433
My orders are
to locate the alien Garrison

12:15.435 --> 12:19.404
and return director henshaw
safely to his post.

12:20.874 --> 12:23.041
The base is yours, sir.

12:23.043 --> 12:26.911
Now, if you'll
excuse me, ladies.

12:37.357 --> 12:40.158
I don't permit cameras
around my research facilities.

12:41.795 --> 12:43.161
Could've fooled me.

12:44.197 --> 12:46.397
A man's gotta protect himself.

12:46.399 --> 12:47.932
Yeah.

12:47.934 --> 12:50.301
You said the break-in
was the work
of "corporate spies,"

12:50.303 --> 12:54.172
but, uh, I've never met any
that leave giant holes
in the ground like this.

12:54.174 --> 12:56.775
You're here to find out
why I said it was
industrial espionage

12:56.777 --> 12:58.276
when you know it wasn't.

12:58.278 --> 12:59.410
Mmm-hmm.

13:01.548 --> 13:03.414
I know who your friends are.

13:03.416 --> 13:06.351
And I find your
association with them
rather troubling.

13:06.353 --> 13:09.287
Especially considering
your prominent role
within the media.

13:09.289 --> 13:13.925
Well, the media doesn't exist
to make people like you
feel comfortable, Max.

13:13.927 --> 13:15.727
Our job
is to report the truth.

13:15.729 --> 13:19.798
(Scoffs)
What an outstanding job
you've all been doing.

13:19.800 --> 13:23.701
Champion low gas prices,
so we continue
to burn fossil fuels.

13:23.703 --> 13:27.739
You celebrate pop stars while
ignoring corrupt politicians.

13:27.741 --> 13:30.475
And you turn pretty blondes
who fly into heroes,

13:30.477 --> 13:32.544
masking the threat
they represent.

13:34.247 --> 13:36.147
But you've never
been their victim.

13:36.983 --> 13:38.516
It changes your perspective.

13:39.519 --> 13:41.820
What are you planning
on doing?

13:41.822 --> 13:43.788
What needs to be done.

13:43.790 --> 13:46.925
My associates will take you
back to your car.

13:47.994 --> 13:49.994
It's okay, I know the way.

13:55.068 --> 13:58.770
I have those
media authorizations
you asked for, Ms. Grant.

13:58.772 --> 14:01.406
Oh, wonderful, Kara.
Wonderful!

14:03.243 --> 14:07.679
Why don't you sit with me
for a minute?

14:09.516 --> 14:12.750
(Stammers) I really
should be getting back
to my desk, Ms. Grant.

14:12.752 --> 14:14.552
I insist.

14:14.554 --> 14:16.454
Okay.

14:16.456 --> 14:19.190
Is there something
i can help you with?

14:19.192 --> 14:21.559
Well, I've just been doing

14:21.561 --> 14:25.096
a teensy little bit
of research into your past,

14:25.098 --> 14:27.632
and I just wanted
to some clarification

14:27.634 --> 14:30.201
on a few details.

14:30.737 --> 14:32.470
Sit, sit.

14:32.472 --> 14:34.072
(Clears throat)

14:34.074 --> 14:35.607
You're 24 years old?

14:35.609 --> 14:37.475
You know I am, Ms. Grant.

14:37.477 --> 14:38.409
Mmm.

14:38.411 --> 14:40.778
Which means you were
what age

14:40.780 --> 14:44.382
when the movie
<i> Titanic</i> came out in 1997?

14:44.384 --> 14:45.817
Uh, uh, six!

14:45.819 --> 14:49.254
Which is the same age you were
when you started what grade?

14:49.256 --> 14:50.655
-First.
-Uh-huh.

14:50.657 --> 14:53.458
-And your teacher's name was?
-Mr. zarzycki.

14:54.527 --> 14:56.227
According to
this report card...

14:56.229 --> 14:58.329
You have my
first grade report card?

14:58.331 --> 15:00.198
Her name was Ruth marchon.

15:00.200 --> 15:02.400
Ms. marchon taught art
at midvale.

15:02.402 --> 15:05.637
And that's a trick question,
because I didn't transfer
there until the eighth grade.

15:06.573 --> 15:08.506
Hmm.

15:08.508 --> 15:11.109
Now, have I convinced you,
Ms. Grant?

15:11.111 --> 15:13.578
(Sighs) Beyond a shadow
of a doubt.

15:14.781 --> 15:16.114
(Sighs)

15:16.116 --> 15:19.083
You are Supergirl.

15:19.085 --> 15:20.919
(Stammers) But... I...

15:20.921 --> 15:24.455
I knew all of the answers
to your insane questions!

15:24.457 --> 15:27.091
Exactly! Only a person
who is determined to lie

15:27.093 --> 15:29.227
can answer all the questions
they're asked.

15:29.229 --> 15:32.530
How do you think
i caught Lance Armstrong?

15:32.532 --> 15:36.634
You see, Kara, you and i
both fight for truth, justice,

15:36.636 --> 15:37.869
and the American way.

15:37.871 --> 15:40.838
It just so happens
that my methods are better.

15:40.840 --> 15:42.707
And more fun.

15:42.709 --> 15:44.342
That will be all for now,

15:45.512 --> 15:47.345
Supergirl.

15:47.347 --> 15:48.646
(Cell phone vibrates)

15:49.983 --> 15:51.616
Sorry, I saw your missed call.

15:51.618 --> 15:54.519
Alex: <i> You need</i>
<i> to get over here. Now.</i>

15:59.793 --> 16:03.795
I don't understand.
I can't read his mind.

16:03.797 --> 16:06.731
I thought that's what
your race was famous for.

16:06.733 --> 16:09.801
Maybe he's playing you
for a fool, non.
Wouldn't be hard to do.

16:09.803 --> 16:11.769
I would never do that to you!

16:11.771 --> 16:14.605
The humans must have developed
some type of technology
that blocks me.

16:14.607 --> 16:16.841
What are you so desperate
to find out?

16:16.843 --> 16:18.910
The location of the deo?

16:18.912 --> 16:20.678
Thinking of launching
a pre-emptive strike?

16:20.680 --> 16:24.549
Perhaps I should pre-emptively
snap your neck.

16:24.551 --> 16:26.184
You kill me,
you kill your wife.

16:26.186 --> 16:28.953
You're nothing
but a barking dog on a chain.

16:28.955 --> 16:30.488
No threat at all.

16:31.758 --> 16:32.857
(Neck snaps)

16:36.296 --> 16:39.464
Now I see how much more
advanced you are
than us savages.

16:49.009 --> 16:52.910
I'm general Samuel Lane
of the United States army.

16:52.912 --> 16:55.980
I wonder how many
of your fellow humans
you had to kill

16:55.982 --> 16:57.782
in order to achieve
such a rank.

16:58.918 --> 17:00.618
And yet you call me a threat.

17:02.922 --> 17:05.323
When I was a little boy,

17:05.325 --> 17:09.260
my daddy used to take me
and my sister to the movies.

17:09.262 --> 17:14.298
Saw a picture called
<i> the day the earth</i>
<i> stood still.</i>

17:14.300 --> 17:17.802
It was about an alien,
like yourself,

17:17.804 --> 17:22.140
who came to earth
and threatened to destroy it

17:22.142 --> 17:25.410
if human beings
didn't change
their wicked ways.

17:25.412 --> 17:29.313
I had nightmares for months.

17:29.315 --> 17:33.051
And do you know
that still, today,

17:33.053 --> 17:35.219
when I look at you,

17:35.221 --> 17:39.223
I am right back
in that old theater.

17:40.026 --> 17:41.592
Afraid.

17:41.594 --> 17:45.363
On Krypton,
it is a show
of great strength

17:45.365 --> 17:48.032
to admit one's fears
to an enemy.

17:48.034 --> 17:50.034
Which is why I told you.

17:50.036 --> 17:55.773
I wanted you to know that,
by your world's standards,
i am a man of honor.

17:55.775 --> 17:59.944
And I take no pleasure
in what comes next.

18:07.654 --> 18:09.654
-(Astra grunting)
-(Groans)

18:12.892 --> 18:14.692
(Gasps)

18:14.694 --> 18:19.931
Now, you are going to tell me
the location of your base.

18:19.933 --> 18:25.503
The only question
is whether you tell me
before we start or after.

18:25.505 --> 18:28.206
Supergirl:
What are you doing?
(Moans)

18:28.208 --> 18:30.608
You can't just
come in here like that.

18:30.610 --> 18:33.377
He's right. The lights,
the kryptonite's
weakening you.

18:33.379 --> 18:34.679
This is who you choose
to side with?

18:34.681 --> 18:37.148
-(Groaning)
-Against your own people?

18:37.150 --> 18:38.483
Your own family?

18:38.485 --> 18:40.084
Stop it, you're hurting her!

18:40.086 --> 18:43.888
I'm sorry,
was she more forthcoming
when you asked nicely?

18:43.890 --> 18:45.790
There's another way
to save Hank.

18:45.792 --> 18:48.926
We are not releasing
a combatant
of this threat level.

18:50.029 --> 18:51.496
General,
we are better than this!

18:51.498 --> 18:54.499
We are. They aren't.
Get her out of here!

18:54.501 --> 18:56.968
-No, don't! Don't! (Screams)
-(Astra screaming)

18:56.970 --> 18:58.436
Supergirl: Please, please!

18:58.938 --> 19:00.371
Please, no!

19:00.373 --> 19:02.673
(Screaming continues)

19:06.980 --> 19:08.546
I mean, if Alex
hadn't stepped in,

19:08.548 --> 19:10.348
I don't know
what I would've done.

19:10.350 --> 19:12.817
I know astra's made
bad decisions, but...

19:12.819 --> 19:14.685
She's still family.

19:14.687 --> 19:16.454
Right. That's my problem.

19:16.456 --> 19:19.257
Anyway,
did you find out anything
when you talked to Max?

19:19.259 --> 19:22.160
Uh, no.
Ah, it's just a dead end.

19:22.162 --> 19:24.929
(Chuckles) I mean,
there's nothing there really.

19:24.931 --> 19:26.030
(Sighs)

19:26.032 --> 19:27.665
Well, at least there's
some good news.

19:27.667 --> 19:29.400
Cat: Kara.

19:29.402 --> 19:30.835
I gotta go.

19:35.208 --> 19:36.607
Yeah.

19:36.609 --> 19:39.210
Kara's a little too trusting
to notice when you're lying,

19:39.212 --> 19:40.745
but I am definitely not.

19:40.747 --> 19:43.114
What did you actually
find out about Max?

19:43.116 --> 19:44.849
Close the door.

19:48.188 --> 19:50.821
He's planning a countermove
against the Kryptonians.

19:50.823 --> 19:52.557
Including Kara.

19:52.559 --> 19:54.325
Yeah, and I don't want
to give him
a chance to hurt her.

19:54.327 --> 19:56.360
So, we need to find out
what he's up to and fast.

19:56.362 --> 19:58.029
Which is why

19:58.031 --> 20:00.231
I didn't just talk to him
when I went down there.

20:00.233 --> 20:05.336
I took surveillance shots,
so you could help me
find a way inside.

20:05.338 --> 20:09.140
I'm sorry, you want,
you wanna break in
to Max lord's facility?

20:10.743 --> 20:12.977
I knew you picking up
that camera again
was a bad idea.

20:12.979 --> 20:17.515
You're like one of those
crazy war correspondents
who can't just stay home.

20:17.517 --> 20:23.221
Okay. Would you really want
Kara to find out that you
let me do this all alone?

20:23.223 --> 20:26.324
Fine, fine!
I'll find you a way in.

20:26.893 --> 20:28.259
Yes, Ms. Grant?

20:28.261 --> 20:29.460
Sit.

20:32.565 --> 20:33.898
(Kara clears throat)

20:38.671 --> 20:41.639
Look into my eyes, Kara.
What do you see?

20:41.641 --> 20:44.242
-Um...
-Bags.

20:44.244 --> 20:48.312
I stayed up until dawn
watching the news coverage
of Supergirl.

20:48.314 --> 20:51.782
All the interrupted muggings,
and the averted car crashes.

20:51.784 --> 20:54.352
And the more I watched,
the more I thought about

20:54.354 --> 20:56.687
the terrible things
that happen
while you're here at work.

20:56.689 --> 20:59.690
(Chuckles) Don't you think
that should prove to you
that I'm not her?

20:59.692 --> 21:01.459
I'm in here while
she's out there.

21:01.461 --> 21:03.694
Oh, please.
We both know
that Supergirl is capable

21:03.696 --> 21:05.563
of pulling off
that parlor trick.

21:05.565 --> 21:09.000
What it really proves to me
is how little
this job means to you.

21:09.002 --> 21:11.535
No. That's not true.
I love my job.

21:11.537 --> 21:14.705
Every minute that you waste
playing assistant in here

21:14.707 --> 21:18.843
is a minute
that someone out there
is not getting saved.

21:18.845 --> 21:20.444
Ms. Grant,
what are you saying?

21:20.446 --> 21:24.482
I am saying
that I will not partake
in this ruse any longer.

21:24.484 --> 21:27.285
So, you either prove to me
that you are not Supergirl,

21:27.287 --> 21:31.989
or you can clean out
your desk tomorrow.

21:38.965 --> 21:40.398
How we doing, winn?

21:40.400 --> 21:43.000
Feeling kind of
exposed out here.

21:43.002 --> 21:45.536
Okay, okay.
The alarms are disabled.

21:45.538 --> 21:49.006
But I'm just gonna need
a little bit more time
with this lock, bud.

21:49.008 --> 21:50.741
You're sure about the alarms?

21:50.743 --> 21:53.044
Yeah, of course
I'm sure. Why?

21:55.248 --> 21:56.047
No reason.

21:59.385 --> 22:01.218
Oh, okay. Okay.

22:04.757 --> 22:07.158
Wow. We may have
a problem here.

22:09.929 --> 22:12.830
Aw. You can't kick lasers,
can you?

22:12.832 --> 22:14.432
Come on, winn.
Help me out here.

22:14.434 --> 22:18.002
Okay, okay.
Only 'cause you asked
so politely.

22:22.842 --> 22:25.910
Got to say, winn,
I'm pretty impressed.

22:35.421 --> 22:37.888
Winn: <i> Wait, wait.</i>
<i> Hold on, wait. Hold there.</i>

22:37.890 --> 22:40.057
(Stammers) That's interesting.

22:40.059 --> 22:41.926
What's interesting?

22:41.928 --> 22:44.228
Well, all the other locks
in Max's facility
use a keypad system,

22:44.230 --> 22:47.465
but this one's
a bio-diagnostic.

22:47.467 --> 22:48.599
What...

22:49.502 --> 22:50.968
Can you hack that?

22:50.970 --> 22:53.104
Winn: <i> No, no, James.</i>
<i> That's, like,</i>
<i> kind of the whole point.</i>

22:53.106 --> 22:55.806
It's better than
a finger print, a voice print,
a retinal scan...

22:55.808 --> 22:57.475
-(Thuds)
-(Groans)

22:57.477 --> 22:59.110
(Feedback)

22:59.112 --> 23:00.911
James, are you still there?

23:03.649 --> 23:05.616
(Cracks neck and sighs)

23:07.220 --> 23:09.220
Alex: <i> Astra gave up</i>
<i> non's location.</i>

23:09.222 --> 23:10.921
We're mobilizing now
to get Hank.

23:10.923 --> 23:14.358
Astra would never
betray her soldiers
or her husband.

23:14.360 --> 23:16.961
If there's a chance
to save Hank,
i have to take it.

23:16.963 --> 23:18.362
Then I'm coming with you.

23:19.532 --> 23:20.631
(Sighs)

23:21.434 --> 23:22.666
(Whooshing)

23:34.514 --> 23:38.449
Echo team, you are clear
for weapons-free engagement.

23:50.062 --> 23:51.562
General, Supergirl's on site!

23:51.564 --> 23:53.330
What the hell
is she doing there?

23:53.332 --> 23:55.900
General Lane: <i> This is</i>
<i> a human recovery mission.</i>

23:55.902 --> 23:57.234
I called her.

24:02.475 --> 24:06.844
The containers
are lined with lead.
I can't see through them.

24:06.846 --> 24:10.247
Right, echo team.
Search those containers
and check your six.

24:27.700 --> 24:29.366
They're closing in, sir.

24:34.807 --> 24:36.207
Supergirl: Hank!

24:42.048 --> 24:43.647
(Buzzing)

24:43.649 --> 24:45.015
Bomb!

24:48.821 --> 24:50.387
(Explosion)

25:08.674 --> 25:10.741
No. (Groaning)

25:19.619 --> 25:21.018
My men...

25:21.020 --> 25:22.486
It was a trap.

25:23.589 --> 25:25.122
Astra played us.

25:37.637 --> 25:41.372
Maxwell: Jimmy Olsen,
intrepid photographer.

25:41.374 --> 25:43.173
I just didn't realize
how intrepid.

25:43.175 --> 25:47.578
My security system
isn't state of the art,
it is the art.

25:49.248 --> 25:52.750
Who helped you get past it?

25:53.252 --> 25:55.519
Hmm?

25:55.521 --> 25:59.189
Well, it's like you said,
I'm intrepid.

26:01.127 --> 26:02.192
Fine.

26:03.129 --> 26:04.795
Let's do this another way.

26:06.666 --> 26:08.899
James: You know, you're...

26:08.901 --> 26:12.169
You're real tough
hiding behind your muscle.

26:12.171 --> 26:15.639
Why don't you be a man
and admit what you're
really up to here, Max?

26:15.641 --> 26:20.311
You think insulting my ego
is going to get me to spill
like some bond villain?

26:20.313 --> 26:21.979
That won't work on me, Jimmy.

26:21.981 --> 26:25.316
But I do like your idea
of settling this like men.

26:25.318 --> 26:28.018
(Groaning)

26:28.020 --> 26:29.219
(Coughing)

26:29.221 --> 26:30.788
-(Maxwell sighs)
-(Groans)

26:33.626 --> 26:37.962
-Human, alien, super.
-(Metal clangs)

26:41.233 --> 26:44.301
-If you go up against me,
you will lose.
-(Gasps)

26:44.303 --> 26:45.936
(Exclaims)

26:45.938 --> 26:47.304
(Clattering)

26:47.306 --> 26:49.607
(James panting)

26:52.144 --> 26:53.243
Next time...

26:55.481 --> 26:57.581
I won't stop with the camera.

27:01.420 --> 27:03.253
(Panting)

27:06.058 --> 27:08.125
May I speak with you,
Ms. Grant?

27:08.127 --> 27:09.994
Oh, well, that depends.

27:10.730 --> 27:12.529
Show me your cape.

27:12.531 --> 27:14.398
(Sighs)

27:14.400 --> 27:18.969
I know you want me
to tell you I'm Supergirl,
but I can't do that.

27:18.971 --> 27:20.270
(Groans)

27:20.272 --> 27:25.542
What I can tell you
is that this job, this place,

27:25.544 --> 27:28.278
is more important to me
than you realize.

27:29.181 --> 27:30.314
Hmm.

27:32.551 --> 27:37.388
Whenever I'm confused
or overwhelmed,

27:37.390 --> 27:40.958
I come in your office
and you somehow sense it.

27:40.960 --> 27:43.527
It's like your superpower.

27:43.529 --> 27:46.230
I know I'm not going
to be your assistant
for the rest of my life,

27:46.232 --> 27:49.233
but I do know whatever
i do next will be easier

27:49.235 --> 27:52.269
because of everything
you taught me.

27:52.271 --> 27:56.306
The truth is, I need you now
more than I ever have.

27:59.645 --> 28:03.280
Well, then you know
what you need to do.

28:11.657 --> 28:14.191
Then you leave me
no choice.

28:16.429 --> 28:17.695
I quit.

28:18.297 --> 28:19.663
Hmm.

28:20.766 --> 28:23.300
You can at least
finish out the day.

28:39.785 --> 28:43.020
James! What happened to you?

28:43.022 --> 28:44.688
It looks
much worse than it is.

28:44.690 --> 28:45.823
That's not what I asked.

28:45.825 --> 28:47.291
I don't want you
getting upset.

28:47.293 --> 28:48.759
That's why I didn't tell you
in the first place.

28:48.761 --> 28:50.694
Max lord did this to you.

28:52.264 --> 28:53.397
(Kara laughs)

28:54.300 --> 28:55.833
You were in on this, too?

28:56.569 --> 28:57.901
You both lied to me?

28:57.903 --> 28:59.703
Hey, we were trying
to help you.

28:59.705 --> 29:02.106
By taking him on yourselves?

29:02.108 --> 29:03.240
(Scoffs)

29:05.711 --> 29:08.712
Max lord is evil.

29:08.714 --> 29:12.549
I see it now,
and I will do
whatever it takes to stop him.

29:12.551 --> 29:15.586
Wait. Kara,
you're sounding
awful lot like astra.

29:15.588 --> 29:17.354
Yeah, what if
she's not so wrong?

29:17.356 --> 29:19.990
-Hey, Kara, don't do this.
Come on!
-You can't stop me!

29:21.560 --> 29:22.793
Get out of my way.

29:22.795 --> 29:27.164
If you go after
Maxwell lord
like this,

29:27.166 --> 29:28.932
then you know what,
you're just proving
him right.

29:28.934 --> 29:31.769
That you are no different
from astra or non.

29:31.771 --> 29:33.604
What if I'm not so different?

29:33.606 --> 29:37.040
You have to be, Kara.

29:37.042 --> 29:40.778
Because if you aren't,
then we lose.

29:40.780 --> 29:46.216
No, you don't understand,
winn. I feel like
i lost everything.

29:47.720 --> 29:49.419
I can't stop Max.

29:49.421 --> 29:51.054
Or get through to astra.

29:51.056 --> 29:55.159
I can't rescue Hank
or salvage
what I had with cat.

29:55.161 --> 29:57.861
Even the memory
of my own mother,

29:57.863 --> 30:01.431
one thing that
i could always count on,

30:03.636 --> 30:05.202
is ruined.

30:09.375 --> 30:10.474
(Sighs)

30:12.444 --> 30:13.911
I have nothing left.

30:16.115 --> 30:18.482
I don't know
what to do anymore.

30:18.484 --> 30:22.786
I have all these powers,
but I've never felt
more powerless.

30:24.356 --> 30:25.455
Hey.

30:26.425 --> 30:30.227
Kara, it's going to be okay.

30:30.229 --> 30:32.462
Even when things
look the bleakest,

30:34.667 --> 30:37.100
heroes find a way.

30:53.886 --> 30:56.286
They sent you back
to try again.

30:56.288 --> 30:58.355
What makes you think
it'll be any different
this time?

30:58.357 --> 31:01.058
Because now,
I'm ready to hear
what you have to say.

31:01.060 --> 31:03.093
I was afraid to listen before.

31:05.664 --> 31:09.233
But today, I got so upset,

31:10.436 --> 31:12.302
I couldn't think.

31:12.304 --> 31:16.506
I didn't want to.
I just wanted
to hurt someone.

31:16.508 --> 31:20.911
Because I was afraid
of losing everything
that mattered to me.

31:20.913 --> 31:22.980
Like you must've felt
back home.

31:26.685 --> 31:28.986
But if we have
any hope for the future,

31:28.988 --> 31:31.889
we can't let
our fear control us.

31:31.891 --> 31:33.557
We have to be better.

31:35.461 --> 31:37.294
You give me too much credit.

31:38.530 --> 31:40.797
Because I know the real you.

31:42.835 --> 31:46.103
The woman you knew
died on Krypton.

31:46.105 --> 31:48.872
I still have faith
there's good in you.

31:50.876 --> 31:53.410
I am not worth your faith.

31:53.412 --> 31:58.282
Everyone deserves faith,
astra. Even you.

31:58.284 --> 32:00.484
Now, tell me what happened
on Krypton.

32:01.854 --> 32:03.387
The truth.

32:05.057 --> 32:08.926
Astra, please look at me.

32:10.696 --> 32:12.362
I believe you.

32:13.432 --> 32:16.867
I believe Krypton
faces annihilation.

32:16.869 --> 32:19.603
And far sooner
than anyone here
will admit.

32:19.605 --> 32:21.071
Then why condemn me?

32:21.073 --> 32:24.241
Because you
killed people,
astra.

32:24.243 --> 32:26.376
No matter what noble goals
you hid behind,

32:26.378 --> 32:28.578
nothing will ever
change that fact.

32:28.580 --> 32:32.015
And I am bound
by more than blood
in this court.

32:33.285 --> 32:36.987
But I promise you,
i will fight for your cause,

32:36.989 --> 32:40.357
not through fear
and manipulation,

32:40.359 --> 32:44.594
but through compassion
and reason.

32:44.596 --> 32:47.597
It is the only hope
to save our world.

32:57.977 --> 32:59.943
I love you, astra.

33:02.548 --> 33:04.081
(Beaming)

33:06.085 --> 33:08.552
Your mother never stopped
believing in me.

33:10.656 --> 33:13.156
You are so much
like her, Kara.

33:17.763 --> 33:19.930
(Sniffling)

33:22.301 --> 33:24.634
It's not too late, astra.

33:26.238 --> 33:28.372
Please tell me
where henshaw is.

33:28.374 --> 33:31.842
The only way to save him
is to make the trade.

33:31.844 --> 33:34.177
The humans
will never agree to that.

33:35.848 --> 33:37.114
(Sighs)

33:37.116 --> 33:39.116
Then it's a good thing
I'm not human.

33:52.664 --> 33:54.998
What do you think
you're doing?

33:55.000 --> 33:56.400
Making a prisoner exchange.

33:56.402 --> 33:58.735
-The hell you are.
-(Guns cocking)

34:01.240 --> 34:02.406
Let us pass, general.

34:02.408 --> 34:05.876
That alien is the enemy,
agent danvers.

34:05.878 --> 34:09.112
Your orders were to bring
director henshaw home.

34:09.114 --> 34:10.814
That's what I'm doing.

34:10.816 --> 34:16.153
You take one more step
and my men will put you down.

34:16.155 --> 34:17.888
I wouldn't be so sure of that.

34:25.664 --> 34:27.631
Soldier:
She saved my life, sir.

34:41.947 --> 34:45.348
How do you know
non and his army
won't betray you?

34:45.350 --> 34:48.518
I don't. But I have faith.

35:05.304 --> 35:09.139
Despite your earlier bravado,
you're clearly conflicted
about this deal.

35:09.141 --> 35:13.009
If it were up to me,
I'd leave you rotting
in that cell.

35:13.011 --> 35:16.012
But I want your people
to see that we're better
than general Lane,

35:16.014 --> 35:19.616
because maybe then
we'll find a way
to end this war.

35:19.618 --> 35:21.518
You sound just like my niece.

35:21.520 --> 35:23.787
She has a powerful effect
on people.

35:27.226 --> 35:28.625
They're here.

35:45.711 --> 35:46.910
Go.

35:52.284 --> 35:53.750
Alex: It's good
to see you, sir.

35:56.655 --> 35:58.221
When I get out of here,
I'll remind you about

35:58.223 --> 36:00.824
our policy against
negotiating with terrorists.

36:00.826 --> 36:04.027
Until then,
I'll just say thanks.

36:04.029 --> 36:05.529
(Chuckles)

36:07.065 --> 36:08.565
Something's wrong.

36:22.281 --> 36:23.613
We're surrounded.

36:23.615 --> 36:25.081
You have to transform.

36:26.685 --> 36:28.151
Prepare to attack!

36:39.531 --> 36:41.264
Stop!

36:41.266 --> 36:42.699
Stand down!

36:46.838 --> 36:48.572
We must strike now, general.

36:48.574 --> 36:49.906
We have them at our mercy.

36:49.908 --> 36:52.676
Honor the agreement, non.

36:52.678 --> 36:54.744
There will be
no more battles today.

37:07.326 --> 37:08.692
Withdraw!

37:19.738 --> 37:22.272
Do not mistake
my compassion
for weakness.

37:23.075 --> 37:24.808
This is not a truce.

37:24.810 --> 37:26.776
Then let's call it a start.

37:34.152 --> 37:36.686
General Lane:
You've only delayed
the inevitable.

37:36.688 --> 37:39.089
This enemy cannot
be reasoned with.

37:39.091 --> 37:44.060
We prefer a more thoughtful
approach here at the deo,
general. Which reminds me...

37:44.062 --> 37:46.463
Your presence
is no longer required.

37:46.465 --> 37:49.199
You can thank my agents
for completing your mission.

37:49.201 --> 37:52.435
Their idealism
will doom this planet.

37:52.437 --> 37:53.803
No.

37:53.805 --> 37:55.639
That's what will save it.

38:07.152 --> 38:08.985
So...

38:08.987 --> 38:12.322
What did Alex mean
when she said
you had to "transform?"

38:12.324 --> 38:14.791
Or did you forget
i had super-hearing?

38:21.767 --> 38:23.733
You're from Mars?

38:23.735 --> 38:25.201
You're from Krypton.

38:26.138 --> 38:28.038
But why stay hidden?

38:28.040 --> 38:31.875
I'm trying to make the world
a safe place for everyone.
Humans and aliens alike.

38:31.877 --> 38:35.478
I failed Alex's father
before I assumed the identity
of Hank henshaw.

38:35.480 --> 38:37.013
I won't fail again.

38:37.015 --> 38:39.649
And you saw what the deo
is like under general Lane.

38:39.651 --> 38:43.953
So, we need Hank,
j'onn, at the top.

38:45.023 --> 38:47.290
You know,
you guys could've told me.

38:47.292 --> 38:48.525
I can keep a secret.

38:48.527 --> 38:49.959
Both: No, you can't.

38:58.970 --> 39:00.303
Ugh.

39:00.305 --> 39:01.371
Kar...

39:04.609 --> 39:06.242
(Whooshing)

39:07.946 --> 39:12.382
And I never realized
how absurd you look
in that ridiculous outfit.

39:12.384 --> 39:14.517
Blue, yellow, and red.

39:14.519 --> 39:16.986
It's like a color wheel
threw up.

39:16.988 --> 39:19.222
(Chuckles) I'm sorry
to bother you, Ms. Grant.

39:19.224 --> 39:21.157
But James Olsen said
you wanted to see me.

39:21.159 --> 39:23.993
Something about you thinking
your assistant was me?

39:23.995 --> 39:28.331
Oh, for god's sake,
are we gonna keep on playing
this tiresome game?

39:28.333 --> 39:31.134
I told you it wasn't
a game, Ms. Grant.

39:31.136 --> 39:32.936
I'm afraid I can't stay long.

39:32.938 --> 39:34.671
There're a lot
of people out there
who need help.

39:34.673 --> 39:36.139
As you well know.

39:36.141 --> 39:37.807
Nice to meet you, by the way.

39:37.809 --> 39:40.310
Nice to meet you, too.
I really like your outfit.

39:40.312 --> 39:42.779
-I like your glasses.
-Thanks.
(Chuckles)

39:42.781 --> 39:44.948
(Clears throat)
We're finished here.

39:44.950 --> 39:48.651
Kara, stop treating Supergirl
like she's your
personal assistant.

39:48.653 --> 39:50.787
She has important work to do.

39:50.789 --> 39:52.689
As do you.

39:52.691 --> 39:56.359
This bottle will
not refill itself.

39:56.361 --> 39:59.062
Good night,
Ms. Grant. Kara.

40:02.134 --> 40:04.033
-(Whooshes)
-And Kara,

40:04.035 --> 40:06.870
you can have your job back
if you would like it.

40:06.872 --> 40:09.973
As long as you don't
tell anyone that I thought
you were...

40:11.376 --> 40:13.143
You know.

40:13.145 --> 40:15.879
I think that would be
in both of our interests,
Ms. Grant.

40:15.881 --> 40:18.848
And Kara, I was wrong.

40:18.850 --> 40:22.752
Now, that I've seen you both
in the same room,
you look nothing like her.

40:44.743 --> 40:46.176
Thank you.

40:47.279 --> 40:48.945
You're welcome.

40:51.516 --> 40:57.887
But, you know,
i wouldn't have minded you
coming to the deo full time.

40:57.889 --> 41:00.323
(Sighs)
I can't leave this place.

41:02.227 --> 41:05.295
It's not just
a secret identity to me.

41:08.633 --> 41:12.836
I almost did something today
that I would've regretted
the rest of my life.

41:12.838 --> 41:14.404
What stopped you?

41:15.340 --> 41:16.973
My friends.

41:17.843 --> 41:19.909
The deo
keeps you human.

41:19.911 --> 41:21.845
They do that for me.

41:58.850 --> 42:01.784
Hey, how are things
on the cat front?

42:01.786 --> 42:05.488
She came to her senses.

42:05.490 --> 42:06.890
(Chuckles)

42:07.792 --> 42:10.093
So did I.

42:10.095 --> 42:12.462
Thank you
for stopping me before.

42:12.464 --> 42:15.298
Hey, it's why
you keep us around, right?
(Chuckles)

42:16.134 --> 42:18.101
So, what's the plan?

42:18.103 --> 42:23.339
We expose whatever
Maxwell lord is up to
and we put him away for good.

42:30.015 --> 42:31.447
They just brought her in.

42:31.449 --> 42:33.216
She meets
all your requirements.

42:33.218 --> 42:35.952
No relatives.
No connections
of any kind.

42:35.954 --> 42:37.687
It wasn't easy to arrange.

42:37.689 --> 42:39.389
I didn't think it would be.

42:39.391 --> 42:41.057
That will be all.

43:06.685 --> 43:08.518
My name is Maxwell lord.

43:09.821 --> 43:12.155
And I'm going to help you.
