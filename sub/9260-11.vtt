WEBVTT

00:01.379 --> 00:02.806
<i>Previously on</i> The Shield <i>...</i>

00:02.903 --> 00:05.855
The bosses are
shipping grenades into L.A.

00:05.952 --> 00:07.404
Get him off!

00:08.782 --> 00:10.355
Grenade!

00:12.667 --> 00:14.800
Guardo's gone.

00:14.867 --> 00:16.600
Vic. What the hell?

00:16.667 --> 00:18.334
Kavanaugh.
What did you tell him?

00:18.401 --> 00:20.301
That I saw your guy
take the heroin.

00:20.367 --> 00:21.700
That's it.

00:21.767 --> 00:24.201
6 months,
you could've warned me!

00:24.267 --> 00:26.800
Maybe all of us are going
to jail because of you.

00:26.867 --> 00:29.700
Without you,
IAD's case goes away.

00:31.684 --> 00:33.591
Jesus. It's you.

00:33.697 --> 00:35.568
You're trying to get
Mackey running to me.

00:35.633 --> 00:38.234
And I so want there
to be trust between you two.

00:38.301 --> 00:40.185
Oh, what the enemy
of my enemy is my friend?

00:40.240 --> 00:42.595
They're gonna need a friend
in a high place, that's you.

00:42.648 --> 00:43.800
If Kavanaugh is successful,

00:43.867 --> 00:46.231
I'm gonna scorch the earth
covering this whole department,

00:46.284 --> 00:47.367
starting with you.

00:47.434 --> 00:49.733
You ever hear of
an Armenian money train?

00:49.800 --> 00:52.067
It's a money laundering
operation of the Armenian mob.

00:52.134 --> 00:54.468
I think the Strike Team
ripped them off.

00:54.534 --> 00:56.110
I heard you had
a rough week,

00:56.137 --> 00:58.706
so I told John
I'd stop by and check--

01:00.367 --> 01:03.267
Your ex-wife's pussy
tastes like sweet butter.

01:03.334 --> 01:05.233
You're under arrest
for possession

01:05.301 --> 01:08.134
of heroin with intent
to distribute.

01:08.201 --> 01:10.834
If I plead guilty
to the heroin,

01:10.900 --> 01:12.301
without me,
this whole deal's off.

01:12.367 --> 01:13.867
He's got nothing
on you guys.

01:13.934 --> 01:16.134
I got Niners
in every pen in the state.

01:16.201 --> 01:19.034
So wherever he touches down,
it will happen.

01:19.101 --> 01:20.334
You sent Lem to Lompoc.

01:20.401 --> 01:21.812
It's you that's
the real murderer.

01:21.865 --> 01:23.267
You don't have
the stomach

01:23.334 --> 01:24.534
to serve Lem up
to Antwon.

01:24.600 --> 01:25.900
I didn't used to.

01:25.967 --> 01:28.534
I'm taking him to the
courthouse 9:00 tomorrow morning.

01:28.600 --> 01:30.120
Listen, I gotta
tell you something.

01:30.226 --> 01:30.900
What?

01:33.246 --> 01:34.597
You're not going
to prison.

01:34.623 --> 01:36.101
Look, we made
a deal with Antwon

01:36.167 --> 01:37.667
to get you
safe passage inside.

01:37.733 --> 01:39.591
It went bad.

01:39.697 --> 01:41.587
Christ, what the hell
am I supposed to do?

01:41.614 --> 01:42.859
We're gonna
hide you locally.

01:42.912 --> 01:44.124
You mean, put him on the run?

01:44.203 --> 01:46.167
Lem, right now, this is
about keeping you alive.

01:46.234 --> 01:47.101
No, no.

01:47.167 --> 01:48.267
Lem, it's only temporary.

01:48.334 --> 01:50.034
I promise you, man.

01:50.101 --> 01:52.367
I promise you
we're gonna make this work.

01:52.434 --> 01:55.301
He screwed my ex-wife
with the sole purpose

01:55.367 --> 01:57.101
of making
this investigation

01:57.167 --> 01:59.301
seem like
a personal vendetta.

01:59.367 --> 02:02.367
You have 48 hours
to tie up the loose ends.

02:05.967 --> 02:07.468
Can I talk to you
for a second?

02:10.467 --> 02:12.568
First of all,
I need you to know,

02:12.633 --> 02:14.267
I've always liked you.

02:14.334 --> 02:16.867
From the first moment
that we met at the school.

02:16.934 --> 02:18.900
I hated that I wasn't able
to tell you the truth

02:18.967 --> 02:20.568
about who I was.

02:20.633 --> 02:21.834
Maybe if I had,

02:21.900 --> 02:23.767
you'd have a whole
different picture of me.

02:23.834 --> 02:26.633
I mean, you like me, right?

02:26.700 --> 02:28.767
Before you found out
I was a, you know...

02:31.218 --> 02:33.920
you thought I was,
like, a decent guy.

02:34.158 --> 02:34.934
Yes.

02:35.000 --> 02:37.600
Different circumstances,

02:37.667 --> 02:38.867
a different time,

02:38.934 --> 02:41.534
Our relationship could've
taken a different turn.

02:41.600 --> 02:45.367
I'm just really, really
tired, you know?

02:45.434 --> 02:48.633
I haven't been able
to eat lately.

02:50.000 --> 02:56.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

03:00.434 --> 03:01.967
Why aren't
you guys inside?

03:02.034 --> 03:03.271
Lem's not here yet.

03:03.324 --> 03:05.101
Where is he?
He's already 1/2 hour late.

03:05.167 --> 03:06.201
He'll be here.

03:06.267 --> 03:08.334
How are you
this morning?

03:09.834 --> 03:11.101
I'm OK.

03:13.334 --> 03:15.000
He didn't leave a message.

03:15.067 --> 03:16.667
If I was going to jail for 18 months,

03:16.733 --> 03:18.367
I wouldn't be
in a rush either.

03:18.434 --> 03:19.733
Give him some time.

03:30.034 --> 03:32.234
I've made you coffee,
and I've been patient.

03:32.301 --> 03:34.067
You need to go.

03:41.234 --> 03:42.700
OK, stop. Stop.

03:42.767 --> 03:43.700
Stop!

03:43.767 --> 03:44.834
Don't touch me!

03:44.900 --> 03:46.267
You're right.

03:46.334 --> 03:48.367
That's good. That's good.

03:48.434 --> 03:50.099
Why are you still here?

03:50.417 --> 03:52.767
Because there's
nowhere else.

03:52.834 --> 03:54.800
You see how lonely
he's made both of us?

03:54.867 --> 03:56.534
I'm not lonely.

03:56.600 --> 03:59.334
I'm moving on with my life.
You need to do the same.

04:00.234 --> 04:01.900
No. Not until
there's justice.

04:01.967 --> 04:04.534
You need to let this go.
You need to let it go.

04:04.600 --> 04:05.667
No, don't.

04:05.733 --> 04:08.201
Cause nobody ever
fights back against him.

04:08.267 --> 04:09.434
Nobody ever
takes his punch

04:09.501 --> 04:11.110
and just smacks him
one right back.

04:11.216 --> 04:12.938
You need to leave.

04:14.301 --> 04:16.067
If I take this fight to him...

04:17.468 --> 04:19.034
and I win.

04:20.267 --> 04:23.534
I need to know
that you're gonna be OK.

04:23.600 --> 04:26.134
Because I don't want you
to hurt anymore.

04:27.334 --> 04:29.501
What are you
talking about?

04:29.568 --> 04:31.800
Would you
be all right...

04:31.867 --> 04:33.134
without him?

04:36.633 --> 04:38.349
- No.
- Mom?

04:40.201 --> 04:41.767
What's going on?

04:41.834 --> 04:46.000
Your mom, she's
a very good person.

04:46.067 --> 04:47.401
She's a...

04:49.067 --> 04:50.733
very good person.

05:29.167 --> 05:30.267
Kavanaugh was here?

05:30.334 --> 05:31.434
All morning.

05:31.501 --> 05:32.434
Yeah.

05:32.501 --> 05:34.101
He said
he wanted to ask me

05:34.167 --> 05:36.267
a few questions to wrap
up this case, but...

05:36.334 --> 05:37.800
did he try to touch you?

05:37.867 --> 05:39.867
Why would you ask that?

05:39.934 --> 05:41.743
What did he say?

05:41.822 --> 05:43.667
Well, he was desperate
and kind of lonely,

05:43.733 --> 05:44.700
and I felt bad for him,

05:44.767 --> 05:45.733
and then out of nowhere,

05:45.793 --> 05:47.175
he said
he was coming after you,

05:47.227 --> 05:48.552
and that he wanted
to make sure

05:48.578 --> 05:50.009
me and the kids
would be OK--

05:50.088 --> 05:51.633
If something
happened to me.

05:51.700 --> 05:53.501
This is about Lem.

05:53.568 --> 05:55.800
He didn't show up at
court to turn himself in.

05:55.867 --> 05:56.934
Where is he?

05:57.000 --> 05:58.367
Nobody knows.
He's a fugitive.

05:58.434 --> 06:01.093
Kavanaugh probably figures
I had something to do with it.

06:01.401 --> 06:02.800
No, I didn't.

06:02.867 --> 06:05.667
He's just pissed because
his case against Lem tanked.

06:05.733 --> 06:07.600
He's making it personal.

06:07.667 --> 06:10.834
He wants to hurt me
through you.

06:10.900 --> 06:12.934
Please, don't let him
in this house again.

06:13.000 --> 06:14.900
All right?

06:17.034 --> 06:18.401
All right.

06:20.267 --> 06:21.900
Be careful.

06:21.967 --> 06:23.534
Always.

06:31.600 --> 06:32.767
Where's Lemansky?

06:32.834 --> 06:34.301
I don't know.

06:35.198 --> 06:37.582
You screwed him once, and now
you've done it again.

06:37.662 --> 06:38.735
Putting him on the run.

06:38.788 --> 06:40.600
Didn't they kick your ass
out of the Barn?

06:40.643 --> 06:41.700
You aid and abet him,

06:41.753 --> 06:43.234
you communicate with him
in any way

06:43.301 --> 06:44.834
without reporting it,

06:44.900 --> 06:46.767
you'll be put in prison
along side him.

06:46.834 --> 06:48.967
We had nothing
to do with this.

06:49.034 --> 06:50.501
My office will have eyes

06:50.568 --> 06:53.234
on all of you, every
second of every day

06:53.301 --> 06:55.501
until Lemansky's caught.

06:58.201 --> 06:59.167
Thank you...

06:59.234 --> 07:01.700
for bringing me back
into your life.

07:10.252 --> 07:13.283
POSTPARTUM

07:17.167 --> 07:19.333
All right, where are we
with those errands?

07:19.334 --> 07:21.001
Spoke to our
federale buddy,

07:21.068 --> 07:22.534
who took Doomsday
off our hands.

07:22.600 --> 07:24.267
He's gonna meet
Lem in TJ,

07:24.333 --> 07:26.014
get him to a safe house
in Ensenada.

07:26.067 --> 07:27.390
That's wall-to-wall
wetbacks.

07:27.391 --> 07:28.768
Surfer Boy will be
a little obvious.

07:28.795 --> 07:29.828
He'll be on the move.

07:29.881 --> 07:31.567
Taco Cop's got a
brother owns a goat ranch

07:31.634 --> 07:33.467
in the mountains north of San Ignacio.

07:33.534 --> 07:35.200
It's a really good place to get lost.

07:35.267 --> 07:36.233
How much?

07:36.300 --> 07:37.801
It's two grand.

07:37.867 --> 07:40.034
And a call on our services
to be determined later.

07:40.101 --> 07:41.333
I can't wait.

07:41.400 --> 07:42.500
What about
living expenses?

07:42.567 --> 07:44.267
Got a line on wire
transfers to Guatemala.

07:44.333 --> 07:45.247
How secure?

07:45.300 --> 07:47.001
Enough to keep it
off immigration's radar.

07:47.068 --> 07:48.168
Used to pay
coyotes mostly.

07:48.233 --> 07:49.701
He's gonna need cash.

07:49.767 --> 07:50.986
It's gonna be
his only leverage.

07:51.065 --> 07:52.549
Let me work on that.

07:53.534 --> 07:56.134
Now all we need is a way
to get him across the border.

07:56.896 --> 07:59.253
How are we gonna
pull that off, man?

07:59.412 --> 08:01.567
Kavanaugh and his cronies
are watching us 24/7.

08:01.634 --> 08:03.333
We're gonna pull it off
the way we always do.

08:03.400 --> 08:06.134
Right under their noses
with a goddamn smile.

08:14.134 --> 08:15.500
Claudette.

08:15.567 --> 08:17.534
We were working
something else.

08:17.600 --> 08:18.634
Not anymore.

08:18.701 --> 08:20.599
You've got history
with these grenade tossers.

08:20.626 --> 08:21.333
Any victims?

08:21.400 --> 08:23.867
Just a half dozen
crown vics.

08:23.934 --> 08:25.434
You've tangled with

08:25.500 --> 08:28.034
some well-armed
Salvadorans before, right?

08:28.101 --> 08:30.434
The guy who imports the
grenades is named Guardo.

08:30.500 --> 08:32.600
We hit him hard
and his weapons stash,

08:32.667 --> 08:34.001
but he got away.

08:34.068 --> 08:35.482
Looks like
he didn't go far.

08:35.561 --> 08:37.101
Agent Gallagher. DEA.

08:37.134 --> 08:39.400
Captain Wyms.
Farmington division.

08:39.467 --> 08:40.400
This is our lot.

08:40.453 --> 08:42.332
We've been running an
op on the El Salvadorans

08:42.400 --> 08:43.600
out of
the travel agency.

08:43.667 --> 08:46.101
Someone wants to move up
to first class.

08:46.168 --> 08:47.400
Detective Mackey
and his team

08:47.467 --> 08:48.967
busted some of that gang
a week ago.

08:49.034 --> 08:50.422
Swept up
a bunch of grenades, MP5s,

08:50.501 --> 08:52.034
a few top level
lieutenants.

08:52.101 --> 08:53.494
And let their
playmaker, Guardo,

08:53.547 --> 08:54.801
slip out
from under your nose.

08:54.867 --> 08:56.434
We're here to assist.

08:56.500 --> 08:58.367
Great. Start
directing traffic.

08:58.434 --> 08:59.967
If a grenade goes off
on my turf,

09:00.034 --> 09:01.901
you get help whether
you like it or not.

09:01.967 --> 09:04.467
Don't step on our toes,
we'll stay off yours.

09:06.600 --> 09:08.034
What an asshole.

09:08.101 --> 09:09.667
Rawlings did burn them.

09:09.734 --> 09:11.692
So now's our chance
to make it up.

09:11.798 --> 09:12.967
Track down whatever
you can find.

09:13.034 --> 09:14.400
Run everything by me.

09:14.467 --> 09:15.667
And Vic,
that renegade shit's

09:15.734 --> 09:16.934
not gonna fly
on my watch.

09:17.001 --> 09:18.767
But you already
knew that.

09:18.834 --> 09:20.901
Looks like a new sheriff
just limped into town.

09:20.967 --> 09:23.534
She's smart. She keeps tabs
on us from her end,

09:23.600 --> 09:25.367
DEA keeps an eye on us
from the other.

09:25.434 --> 09:27.068
I don't give a shit
about neither.

09:27.134 --> 09:28.267
We'll follow up on this,

09:28.333 --> 09:30.400
but finding Lem
safe passage to Mexico

09:30.467 --> 09:32.367
is still priority one.

10:02.634 --> 10:04.267
Hey, hello?

10:04.333 --> 10:05.901
Hey, open the door.

10:05.967 --> 10:07.934
Open the door now.

10:15.434 --> 10:18.001
Hey, it's OK. It's OK.
Where's your mommy?

10:18.068 --> 10:19.500
Where's your mommy?

10:19.567 --> 10:22.634
Hey, buddy,
what's your name?

10:22.701 --> 10:24.901
What's his name?

10:24.967 --> 10:26.034
Wendell.

10:26.101 --> 10:28.410
Wendell, will you let me
wash it off for you?

10:28.543 --> 10:29.701
Shh. It's OK.

10:29.767 --> 10:31.015
It's gonna be
all right, buddy.

10:31.095 --> 10:31.867
It's all right.

10:31.934 --> 10:34.034
It's gonna be OK.
It's just a little cut.

10:34.101 --> 10:36.134
Here we go.
It's all right.

10:36.200 --> 10:37.934
What the hell's
going on in here, guys?

10:38.001 --> 10:39.467
It's OK.
It's all right.

10:39.534 --> 10:41.434
Lisa.
Call the police.

10:41.500 --> 10:43.267
It's OK. I'm a cop.

10:43.333 --> 10:45.168
Lisa, there's a gun.
Call the police!

10:45.233 --> 10:46.333
Come here, come here.

10:46.400 --> 10:47.333
Hold this tight.

10:47.400 --> 10:49.040
Hold it till
someone gets here, OK?

10:49.120 --> 10:50.736
Are you calling?

11:27.400 --> 11:27.947
Yo.

11:28.900 --> 11:29.562
Hey.

11:30.701 --> 11:31.967
We're cops. We're cops.

11:33.130 --> 11:34.084
Get up!

11:34.267 --> 11:35.567
Get him down.

11:35.634 --> 11:36.600
Let me see your hands.

11:36.667 --> 11:37.834
What do you want?

11:37.901 --> 11:40.667
Some of our Salvadoran
amigos went all Superdome

11:40.734 --> 11:42.200
on a DEA
parking lot.

11:42.267 --> 11:44.867
Turned some crown vics
into some scrap metal.

11:47.567 --> 11:50.034
I'd start talking before he
goes Superdome on your head.

11:50.101 --> 11:51.434
The DEA's
been up our ass.

11:51.500 --> 11:53.333
Busted our number
two Osorio.

11:53.400 --> 11:55.934
Bosses sent
a message to the feds.

12:04.658 --> 12:06.566
That's the third Mexican
that gave up

12:06.619 --> 12:08.181
that it's payback
for busting Osorio.

12:08.234 --> 12:09.901
Which means it can't
possibly be true.

12:09.967 --> 12:11.734
Soldiers have been fed
their cover story,

12:11.801 --> 12:12.801
but what's the truth?

12:12.867 --> 12:15.967
I think Kavanaugh
found Lem's trailer.

12:16.034 --> 12:16.934
What?

12:17.001 --> 12:18.333
Sheriff's department
got called

12:18.400 --> 12:19.701
to the trailer park
on a disturbance.

12:19.767 --> 12:21.701
Cliff says Kavanaugh's
on his way there now.

12:21.767 --> 12:23.300
Your pal say anything
about Lem?

12:23.367 --> 12:24.934
No. Radio blackout,
but something's poppin'.

12:25.001 --> 12:26.500
Kavanaugh's
poking around, man.

12:26.567 --> 12:27.934
What else
could it be?

12:28.001 --> 12:30.016
Look, we would've heard
something if they arrested him.

12:30.069 --> 12:32.001
Maybe. Maybe not.
Who knows with Kavanaugh.

12:32.068 --> 12:33.734
Maybe they found him,
and he was...

12:33.801 --> 12:35.200
There's no way
he'd eat his gun.

12:35.267 --> 12:36.300
No way.

12:36.367 --> 12:39.434
We told him not to
contact us at any cost.

12:39.500 --> 12:41.967
We're in
no man's land.

12:42.034 --> 12:43.034
Best case scenario,

12:43.101 --> 12:44.890
he's on the run with
Kavanaugh on his ass.

12:44.969 --> 12:46.456
Look, man.
Lem knows the score.

12:46.536 --> 12:48.072
He's gonna meet us tonight,
get supplies,

12:48.125 --> 12:49.901
which means we gotta
pull our shit together

12:49.967 --> 12:51.701
to get his ticket
out of here by then.

12:51.767 --> 12:55.734
The truth is,
this could be good bye.

12:55.801 --> 12:57.134
Come on.

12:59.145 --> 13:01.297
Well... he been runnin' that way.

13:02.034 --> 13:03.500
This is it?

13:10.233 --> 13:11.168
This the man you saw?

13:11.233 --> 13:12.567
Yeah, that's him.

13:12.634 --> 13:13.600
So...

13:13.667 --> 13:14.767
what happened?

13:14.834 --> 13:15.767
I heard something.

13:15.834 --> 13:17.367
Came outside,
saw him in the trailer.

13:17.434 --> 13:19.300
Saw the kid bleeding.

13:19.367 --> 13:20.929
Did he say
anything to you?

13:21.194 --> 13:23.534
He said he was a cop.

13:23.819 --> 13:28.248
The whole thing seemed pretty weird
so I had my lady called the real cops.

13:28.767 --> 13:29.867
What then?

13:29.934 --> 13:31.400
Oh, he was off and running.

13:31.467 --> 13:34.434
Funny thing was,
big guy like that

13:34.500 --> 13:35.634
with a gun and all,

13:35.701 --> 13:38.034
he still looked
awful scared.

13:39.467 --> 13:40.867
Yeah, it's funny.

13:46.634 --> 13:47.767
What's this?

13:47.834 --> 13:49.667
Your former C.I. says
she's got information

13:49.734 --> 13:51.669
on the demolished
DEA cars.

13:51.722 --> 13:53.549
Well, give her to the feds.
We don't want her.

13:53.655 --> 13:55.300
I tried. She'll only
talk to you.

13:55.367 --> 13:56.901
Kavanaugh cut me
loose, Vic.

13:56.967 --> 13:58.734
I'm not working
for him no more.

13:58.801 --> 14:01.534
Now that you've stabbed one
of my guys with an indictment.

14:01.600 --> 14:03.567
You need another
PD tit to suck on?

14:03.634 --> 14:07.101
It's real good intel.

14:07.168 --> 14:10.134
It's not my dime.
Your call.

14:10.233 --> 14:11.767
Give us a minute.

14:16.767 --> 14:19.967
I know she's the one Kavanaugh
had testify against Lem.

14:20.034 --> 14:21.701
It's all bullshit.

14:21.767 --> 14:23.134
She as inside
as she says?

14:24.467 --> 14:26.101
See what the story is.

14:26.168 --> 14:27.434
Make sure she sticks
around the Barn

14:27.500 --> 14:28.967
where I can see her.

14:30.467 --> 14:32.967
Blowing up those DEA
cars wasn't retaliation.

14:33.034 --> 14:34.534
Nothing we don't know.

14:34.600 --> 14:36.734
Guardo's play for drug
protection's paid off.

14:36.801 --> 14:38.701
Colombians have a huge
shipment coming up from Mexico.

14:38.767 --> 14:40.791
Hired him and his crew
to guard it.

14:40.817 --> 14:42.565
The feds feel like they
were making a dent

14:42.618 --> 14:44.134
in the Salvadoran
drug game.

14:44.200 --> 14:47.034
Meanwhile, something else is
going on underneath their noses.

14:47.101 --> 14:49.634
Yeah. Guardo's
a crazy shithead.

14:49.701 --> 14:51.333
Any excuse to blow
something up.

14:51.400 --> 14:52.333
When and where?

14:52.400 --> 14:53.333
Tonight.

14:53.400 --> 14:55.267
Going through a grocery import guy.

14:55.333 --> 14:57.233
Aldo Melchor.

14:57.300 --> 14:59.200
The importer.
He Salvadoran?

14:59.267 --> 15:00.600
Mexican.

15:02.333 --> 15:05.367
Need a place and a time.

15:05.434 --> 15:06.767
That's all I got.

15:06.834 --> 15:08.967
That's real good
information though.

15:09.034 --> 15:10.267
If it's true.

15:10.333 --> 15:12.267
Not just another chance
for you to help Kavanaugh

15:12.333 --> 15:13.567
to nail us again.

15:13.634 --> 15:16.001
No. I never wanted
to help Kavanaugh.

15:16.068 --> 15:17.901
Right. Now who's the source
of your intel?

15:17.967 --> 15:20.300
You never needed
to know that before.

15:20.367 --> 15:22.001
I trusted you before.

15:24.034 --> 15:25.267
Fine.

15:27.233 --> 15:29.134
I want to get paid
up front then.

15:29.200 --> 15:30.734
I need money
to get out of L.A.

15:30.801 --> 15:32.834
Take Sebastio,
head up to Seattle,

15:32.901 --> 15:34.267
be with my sister.

15:34.333 --> 15:37.300
I'm so happy you got
a little plan.

15:38.134 --> 15:39.068
What about Lem?

15:39.134 --> 15:40.701
He gonna head up
to Seattle?

15:40.767 --> 15:42.689
Live with
your sister, too?

15:42.742 --> 15:44.225
Oh, that's right.
He can't.

15:44.278 --> 15:45.567
Because he's gonna
be in prison.

15:45.634 --> 15:46.701
I'm sorry.

15:46.767 --> 15:47.767
Vic took care of you.

15:47.834 --> 15:49.901
He fed you and your kid
for months.

15:49.967 --> 15:52.200
And you were sticking us
the whole goddamn time.

15:52.267 --> 15:53.801
No! You see this?

15:53.867 --> 15:56.001
I slept with
this scumbag Ignacio

15:56.068 --> 15:58.034
to get this info
for you, OK?

15:58.101 --> 16:00.734
Then two of his buddies
joined in.

16:00.801 --> 16:02.600
Ripped me up pretty bad.

16:07.134 --> 16:08.667
If you...

16:08.734 --> 16:12.434
made different choices
from the beginning...

16:13.500 --> 16:15.701
none of us would be
ripped up right now.

16:36.534 --> 16:37.801
Becca.

16:40.780 --> 16:42.448
Come on, make it look
like we're on a date.

16:42.528 --> 16:44.534
I can't do anything to
help you escape the police.

16:44.600 --> 16:46.367
Make it look like
a lovers quarrel then.

16:46.434 --> 16:49.701
Look, the only advice
I can give you legally

16:49.767 --> 16:51.367
is to turn yourself in now.

16:51.434 --> 16:52.867
That's exactly what
I want to do.

16:52.934 --> 16:54.734
Then we're on
the wrong side of town.

16:54.801 --> 16:56.134
Look, I need assurances.

16:56.200 --> 16:58.300
You're not exactly
in a position--

16:58.367 --> 16:59.934
I need to do
my time someplace

17:00.001 --> 17:02.867
where the One-Niners and
Antwon Mitchell can't get to me.

17:02.934 --> 17:05.001
Federal prison
back east.

17:05.068 --> 17:06.400
The feds aren't calling this

17:06.467 --> 17:09.034
and going fugitive means
the original deal's gone.

17:09.101 --> 17:10.567
Then I'll plead to
new federal charges.

17:10.634 --> 17:12.200
I'll tell them
all the shit that I did.

17:12.267 --> 17:15.222
You can't just serve them
your head on a platter either.

17:15.267 --> 17:16.500
Kavanaugh's
not gonna stop

17:16.567 --> 17:18.967
until he's
carving me up.

17:19.034 --> 17:21.800
Tell them that
I ripped off

17:21.867 --> 17:23.666
an Armenian money laundering operation,

17:23.733 --> 17:25.701
stole cash that was
part of a federal sting.

17:25.767 --> 17:26.867
I'll plead to that.

17:26.934 --> 17:28.134
You did this by yourself?

17:28.200 --> 17:29.134
Yeah.

17:29.200 --> 17:30.734
Listen to me.

17:30.801 --> 17:32.734
They're going to insist
on Vic and the others.

17:32.801 --> 17:34.333
I got nothing to say
about them.

17:34.400 --> 17:35.534
Then why are you running?

17:35.600 --> 17:38.068
I'm not running.
I'm giving myself up.

17:38.134 --> 17:39.534
All right,
I'm ending it.

17:39.600 --> 17:41.701
You want a new deal,
they'll want new information.

17:41.767 --> 17:44.200
I'm giving them
new information on myself.

17:44.267 --> 17:46.200
You are not hearing me.

17:46.267 --> 17:47.867
There will be no deal

17:47.934 --> 17:49.474
until you give them
more than you.

17:49.554 --> 17:51.333
Curtis, please,
you listen to me.

17:51.400 --> 17:54.200
You have got to
think about yourself.

17:54.267 --> 17:55.233
This one time.

17:55.399 --> 17:57.034
It's your only option.

17:57.101 --> 17:59.200
Now, Vic told me
that you guys sometimes

17:59.267 --> 18:00.867
would spread around
some drug money

18:00.934 --> 18:02.168
to keep peace on the streets.

18:02.233 --> 18:03.434
Listen to me,
this Armenian thing

18:03.500 --> 18:04.667
was armed robbery.

18:04.734 --> 18:06.934
People got killed.

18:07.001 --> 18:08.834
And they weren't
the only ones.

18:08.901 --> 18:11.101
You think it was all just
pawning off some drug money

18:11.168 --> 18:12.600
to keep the streets quiet?

18:12.667 --> 18:15.333
I can't tell the truth
about the others because...

18:15.400 --> 18:17.362
they'll throw us away
for the rest of our lives.

18:17.441 --> 18:19.168
Open your goddamn eyes
to who we are.

18:19.233 --> 18:20.333
People got killed?

18:20.344 --> 18:22.300
This is all
attorney/client privilege.

18:22.367 --> 18:24.265
Detective Terry Crowley.

18:24.367 --> 18:25.367
You've heard enough.

18:25.434 --> 18:26.801
Just get me my deal,

18:26.867 --> 18:28.400
do my time back east.

18:28.467 --> 18:30.967
Then I'll
turn myself in.

18:32.001 --> 18:33.967
I'll call you
in a few hours.

18:44.400 --> 18:46.734
Ow! Goddamnit!

18:52.400 --> 18:54.233
Piece of shit just
scalded my hand.

18:54.300 --> 18:55.400
Could've been
user error.

18:55.467 --> 18:57.433
If you can push
through the pain,

18:57.512 --> 18:59.010
we've got a woman
assaulted on Vermont.

18:59.063 --> 19:00.134
Let's roll.

19:00.200 --> 19:01.767
Get a statement
from her.

19:01.834 --> 19:03.934
Um, you're not
pairing me up with him.

19:04.001 --> 19:05.834
You're the only
two singles on the floor.

19:05.901 --> 19:07.734
Consider it permanent.

19:07.801 --> 19:09.034
Cross Street, 7th.

19:09.101 --> 19:11.734
Hey, it's no great joy
for me, either.

19:11.801 --> 19:13.600
I'm gonna put
some ice on this.

19:13.864 --> 19:15.834
6 months I kept this place
running smooth as silk,

19:15.901 --> 19:17.001
and for what?

19:17.068 --> 19:19.667
No commendation, no
letter for my package,

19:19.734 --> 19:21.534
not even a "hey, Steve,
way to go."

19:21.600 --> 19:22.634
It's humiliating.

19:22.701 --> 19:24.400
Welcome back.

19:25.734 --> 19:28.001
See? No respect.

19:28.068 --> 19:29.434
Wyms is even
moving my desk

19:29.500 --> 19:31.034
where everybody can get
a good gander

19:31.101 --> 19:32.713
at Caesar lying
in a puddle of blood.

19:32.793 --> 19:35.200
In this story,
you're Caesar?

19:35.267 --> 19:36.701
Did I get stabbed
in the back or not?

19:36.767 --> 19:38.934
Um, I'm driving.

19:39.001 --> 19:41.667
I get nauseous
in the passenger seat.

19:45.701 --> 19:47.034
Why don't you apply
for a transfer?

19:47.101 --> 19:48.934
Show them they can't
kick you around.

19:49.001 --> 19:51.001
No, I got this commute
all figured out.

19:51.068 --> 19:53.034
Besides, it's only
56 months 'til I retire.

19:53.101 --> 19:55.333
And then I get out of
this shithole for good.

20:13.233 --> 20:14.467
Aldo Melchor?

20:14.534 --> 20:16.934
Hey, let me see
your hands!

20:17.001 --> 20:18.767
Easy, easy.

20:20.300 --> 20:21.567
It's a knife.

20:21.634 --> 20:22.634
To cut my chorizo.

20:22.701 --> 20:23.867
It's OK if I have my lunch?

20:23.934 --> 20:26.333
As long as it's
finger food.

20:26.400 --> 20:28.600
What can I do
for you, officers?

20:28.667 --> 20:30.168
Rumor has it
you import

20:30.233 --> 20:32.233
more than just
chorizo from down south.

20:32.300 --> 20:34.567
Everything in this store
is legal.

20:34.634 --> 20:36.134
Really?

20:36.200 --> 20:38.500
You won't mind
if we stick around

20:38.567 --> 20:40.168
and monitor your
import-export.

20:40.233 --> 20:41.233
I close at 7:00.

20:41.300 --> 20:42.634
Not tonight.

20:42.701 --> 20:44.892
You're gonna stay open until
that shipment of coke arrives.

20:44.972 --> 20:46.137
We're just
gonna hang out.

20:46.217 --> 20:48.267
Provide a little
after hours security.

20:49.929 --> 20:51.967
Salvadorans realize
you snitched on them,

20:52.034 --> 20:54.834
they're gonna grind you
into chorizo.

20:54.901 --> 20:56.068
Sell you by
the quarter pound

20:56.134 --> 20:58.168
like the rest of the sausage
you got down there.

21:02.421 --> 21:04.333
Is there something
I can do for you?

21:04.400 --> 21:06.367
Tell us what time
the shipment comes.

21:06.434 --> 21:07.580
We'll keep you out of it.

21:07.659 --> 21:09.275
Bust the Salvadorans
after they leave.

21:09.354 --> 21:11.200
Keep your pipeline
up and running.

21:11.267 --> 21:13.200
What else?

21:16.233 --> 21:17.567
Obviously, you can import.

21:17.634 --> 21:20.767
Your exporting skills
better be just as good.

21:20.834 --> 21:23.400
I've stayed in business
15 years.

21:25.967 --> 21:27.200
We have a little package

21:27.267 --> 21:29.200
we want to overnight
to Mexico.

21:29.267 --> 21:31.434
How big is it?

21:31.500 --> 21:33.534
About 6'2".

21:44.313 --> 21:45.716
Just heard.

21:49.134 --> 21:50.767
There's a good-looking kid.

21:52.300 --> 21:53.901
His name's Lee.

21:53.967 --> 21:55.400
After my dad.

21:56.333 --> 21:58.168
Congratulations.

21:58.234 --> 22:00.700
Yeah. Thanks.

22:07.967 --> 22:09.534
You good? Do you
need anything?

22:09.600 --> 22:11.567
My mom's coming tomorrow.

22:11.634 --> 22:13.101
My two brothers,
this weekend.

22:13.168 --> 22:15.700
I got more help than
I know what to do with.

22:17.967 --> 22:19.367
Cash from the baby pool.

22:19.433 --> 22:21.333
Pretty shrewd.

22:21.400 --> 22:24.801
Not revealing
the baby's daddy.

22:30.433 --> 22:31.767
Want to hold him?

22:33.667 --> 22:34.901
Sure.

22:45.693 --> 22:46.567
Hey...

22:48.079 --> 22:50.304
Shh. OK. OK.

22:53.394 --> 22:55.567
We didn't find one of...

22:57.706 --> 23:00.634
Everyone thought you could use
it more than anyone else, so...

23:00.700 --> 23:03.667
It's almost 3 grand.

23:03.734 --> 23:06.467
My evil plan worked.

23:07.801 --> 23:09.567
Tell everyone
I said, thank you.

23:19.567 --> 23:21.034
When he's old enough
and he asks,

23:21.101 --> 23:24.134
I'll tell him.

23:25.834 --> 23:27.101
But for now, I just...

23:27.168 --> 23:29.567
When he's
old enough.

23:46.201 --> 23:47.467
Hey. Yo.

23:49.979 --> 23:52.390
You want to tell me what the
hell Becca's doing up there?

23:52.469 --> 23:54.134
Talking to Kavanaugh
and Aceveda.

23:54.201 --> 23:56.067
Can you think
of any scenario

23:56.134 --> 23:57.867
where that's a good thing?

23:57.934 --> 24:00.634
Curtis Lemansky is
prepared to turn himself in.

24:00.700 --> 24:02.168
If you've talked to him,

24:02.234 --> 24:04.201
you have an obligation
to tell us where he is.

24:04.268 --> 24:05.324
I know my obligations.

24:05.350 --> 24:06.489
I don't know
where he is.

24:06.595 --> 24:08.201
Curtis knows where
the Barn is

24:08.268 --> 24:09.400
if he wants to
turn himself in.

24:09.467 --> 24:10.970
He couldn't turn himself
over to you

24:11.050 --> 24:12.534
for reasons
that involve his safety.

24:12.600 --> 24:14.500
Any cop who's incarcerated
faces those risks.

24:14.567 --> 24:15.934
He knew that.

24:16.001 --> 24:17.500
He made his choice
when he broke the law.

24:17.567 --> 24:19.801
This was a calculated move
by lieutenant Kavanaugh

24:19.867 --> 24:21.767
to put Curtis' life
in jeopardy

24:21.834 --> 24:24.801
to compel him to testify
against his team.

24:24.867 --> 24:26.234
Any proof of that?

24:27.670 --> 24:30.027
Look, the department wants
to mitigate the damage.

24:30.080 --> 24:31.901
And when Lemansky didn't
show up for processing,

24:31.967 --> 24:33.168
the chief
handed authority

24:33.234 --> 24:34.234
over to my
police committee.

24:34.300 --> 24:36.141
All we're asking for
is protection.

24:36.194 --> 24:38.059
At least until I have
a chance to investigate

24:38.138 --> 24:39.754
his claims against
lieutenant Kavanaugh.

24:39.860 --> 24:40.700
And after that?

24:40.767 --> 24:42.067
He'll accept
the previous deal.

24:42.134 --> 24:44.367
As long as we can reasonably
guarantee his safety.

24:44.433 --> 24:45.734
He can't have
the same deal.

24:45.801 --> 24:47.034
He ran away
from that deal,

24:47.101 --> 24:49.467
and if the council signs
off, they're gonna want more.

24:49.534 --> 24:52.101
My client is willing
to plead to new charges.

24:52.181 --> 24:54.054
But he wants his choice
of federal prisons.

24:54.134 --> 24:55.834
What's he have to say
about his friends?

24:55.901 --> 24:56.867
Nothing.

24:56.934 --> 24:57.867
Not good enough.

24:57.934 --> 24:59.534
I have to run this
up a few ladders,

24:59.600 --> 25:03.934
so... give me 'til
the end of the day.

25:10.767 --> 25:12.234
Look, I'll find him first.

25:12.300 --> 25:14.901
Then we can
dictate the terms.

25:14.967 --> 25:16.567
I need bodies, though.

25:16.634 --> 25:19.433
I want two surveillance
teams on Mackey and his guys

25:19.500 --> 25:21.268
in case they try to help
Lemansky escape.

25:21.333 --> 25:23.600
You burned your bridges
with the chief.

25:23.667 --> 25:26.034
I need my people
on the street.

25:29.891 --> 25:30.712
Becca.

25:31.068 --> 25:32.233
Becca.

25:32.313 --> 25:33.801
What happened with Lem,
is he all right?

25:33.867 --> 25:34.967
Privileged information.

25:35.034 --> 25:36.734
Tell me he's OK.

25:38.500 --> 25:40.567
Well, at least
tell me what's wrong.

25:40.634 --> 25:41.600
Wait.

25:41.667 --> 25:42.767
Don't touch me.

25:42.834 --> 25:45.333
Haven't you done
enough damage yet?

25:45.400 --> 25:46.534
Becca, come on.

25:46.600 --> 25:49.234
Come on. Let's go
somewhere and talk.

25:49.300 --> 25:50.634
Talk about

25:50.700 --> 25:54.067
armed robbery of an Armenian
money laundering operation?

25:54.134 --> 25:56.667
Talk about murdering
Terry Crowley?

25:56.734 --> 25:57.734
I told you.

25:57.801 --> 25:59.101
Yes, you did.

25:59.168 --> 26:00.400
And now,
I know the truth.

26:00.467 --> 26:02.101
I let you touch me.

26:02.168 --> 26:03.834
It makes me sick.

26:03.901 --> 26:06.567
Becca, I don't know
what Lem told you...

26:06.634 --> 26:07.767
No more explanations.

26:07.834 --> 26:09.168
It's all bullshit.

26:10.734 --> 26:12.567
You've lied so much

26:12.634 --> 26:14.867
you forgot
what the truth is.

26:16.367 --> 26:17.567
Was I lying
to you last night?

26:17.634 --> 26:21.367
I don't ever want to think
about last night.

26:23.101 --> 26:25.534
You know, I was worried about

26:25.600 --> 26:27.467
what I'd do if I had to
choose between

26:27.534 --> 26:31.001
being Curtis's lawyer
or your friend.

26:31.067 --> 26:32.333
Not anymore.

26:47.967 --> 26:49.234
Did you see the guy
who attacked you?

26:49.300 --> 26:51.300
No. He just came up
from behind me

26:51.367 --> 26:52.767
and started
hitting me.

26:52.834 --> 26:55.034
I was trying
to cover my face.

26:55.101 --> 26:57.767
This area can get pretty
rough even in daylight.

26:57.834 --> 26:58.867
What were you
doing here

26:58.934 --> 27:02.367
besides prettying up
the place.

27:02.433 --> 27:06.400
Um, I'm a volunteer tutor at the
community center on the corner.

27:06.467 --> 27:08.667
I was trying
to help some kids, you know.

27:08.734 --> 27:10.934
We're gonna have you come
in, look at some pictures.

27:11.001 --> 27:14.201
But why? I told you,
I didn't see him.

27:14.268 --> 27:16.433
Maybe you saw more
than you think.

27:16.500 --> 27:18.067
Is that really
necessary?

27:18.134 --> 27:19.500
Excuse us for a minute.

27:21.767 --> 27:22.734
Send her home.

27:22.801 --> 27:24.801
If she remembers anything,
she can call us.

27:24.867 --> 27:27.001
Well, figure out another
way to get her phone number

27:27.067 --> 27:29.168
because I'm
bringing her in.

27:29.234 --> 27:30.567
I was acting captain,
remember?

27:30.634 --> 27:32.500
I'm making the call.

27:39.168 --> 27:40.634
Hey, I talked to the owner
of the store

27:40.700 --> 27:42.671
across from where
Tori was attacked.

27:42.803 --> 27:44.333
He see anything?

27:44.400 --> 27:45.520
She saw them arguing,

27:45.584 --> 27:47.067
she went in the back,
when she came out,

27:47.134 --> 27:48.934
the guy had Tori on the
ground and was hitting her.

27:49.001 --> 27:50.490
- You get the description?
- I got an I.D.

27:50.569 --> 27:52.007
Owner says the guy's
a curb jockey.

27:52.060 --> 27:53.333
Sits in a green cab
most days

27:53.400 --> 27:54.981
waiting for fares
by the intersection.

27:55.034 --> 27:56.173
Yeah, well,
miss pretty thing

27:56.226 --> 27:57.921
never said anything
about arguing with the guy.

27:57.974 --> 27:58.821
No. I know she didn't.

27:58.900 --> 28:00.734
We should take another
run at Tori.

28:00.801 --> 28:03.067
Maybe she'll ask you
to give her a hug.

28:03.134 --> 28:04.300
Let's wait.

28:04.367 --> 28:06.201
Bring the suspect
in first.

28:06.268 --> 28:07.967
Uh, yes, yes.

28:08.034 --> 28:10.367
I'd like to talk
to the owner

28:10.433 --> 28:11.700
of the vending machines

28:11.767 --> 28:14.001
at the Farmington
police station.

28:14.067 --> 28:15.975
- Hey, it's Curtis.
- Hi.

28:16.055 --> 28:18.001
<i>Look, I'm kind of in a
hurry. What's going on?</i>

28:18.067 --> 28:19.333
You're in
a holding pattern.

28:19.400 --> 28:21.167
They said they'd take your
offer under advisement,

28:21.246 --> 28:22.700
but gave no
indication when

28:22.767 --> 28:23.967
or what
the answer might be.

28:24.034 --> 28:25.667
Jesus Christ.

28:26.834 --> 28:29.234
OK, look. I need you to get
a message to Vic.

28:29.300 --> 28:30.600
That would be
breaking the law.

28:31.075 --> 28:31.934
Shit.

28:32.001 --> 28:33.700
All right. Forget it.
Forget it.

28:33.767 --> 28:35.333
It's gonna be worse
if they catch you.

28:35.400 --> 28:36.767
Now that I've told them
what you want.

28:36.834 --> 28:38.767
They know there's more
shit to uncover.

28:38.834 --> 28:40.934
Kavanaugh will show
no mercy.

28:41.001 --> 28:42.300
I know.

28:45.567 --> 28:47.433
There is one other
option though.

28:47.500 --> 28:48.600
What?

28:48.667 --> 28:50.400
<i>Witness protection.</i>

28:51.600 --> 28:53.433
And you tell them
everything.

28:55.034 --> 28:56.201
Witness protection.

28:56.268 --> 28:57.834
The entire truth.

28:57.901 --> 29:00.600
Imagine. You'll be free
of the lies, the running.

29:00.667 --> 29:04.134
People pay a price
for what they did.

29:06.634 --> 29:08.734
I can't. I can't.

29:08.801 --> 29:11.667
<i>Curtis, you're the one
with the heart.</i>

29:11.734 --> 29:12.667
<i>Now, use your head.</i>

29:12.734 --> 29:14.834
This isn't about
my goddamn heart.

29:14.901 --> 29:16.934
I'm just trying
to help you here, Curtis.

29:17.001 --> 29:19.534
No, you're trying
to get me to turn

29:19.600 --> 29:21.367
on my family.

29:24.567 --> 29:27.067
Please, just get me my deal.

29:35.036 --> 29:36.573
He held out
as long as he could.

29:36.625 --> 29:37.687
He's still holding.

29:37.740 --> 29:39.276
He didn't want to run
in the first place.

29:39.329 --> 29:40.634
He would run
before he would rat.

29:40.700 --> 29:42.168
How do they know about
the money train?

29:42.234 --> 29:43.159
Educated guess.

29:43.212 --> 29:44.973
There's always been
plenty of suspicion,

29:45.026 --> 29:45.867
just never any proof.

29:45.934 --> 29:47.134
Unless Lem gave it
to them.

29:47.201 --> 29:48.333
We know Lem, look...

29:48.400 --> 29:49.766
if he had
a change of heart,

29:49.767 --> 29:50.834
he would've tipped us.

29:50.901 --> 29:53.500
He wouldn't if his deal
meant us going down.

29:53.567 --> 29:54.867
Look, I'm not saying
that it happened.

29:54.934 --> 29:56.713
I'm just saying are we
willing to bet our freedom

29:56.793 --> 29:57.685
that it didn't.

29:57.738 --> 29:59.667
I'm not gonna believe it 'til
I see it with my own eyes.

29:59.910 --> 30:00.867
Lem's not
contacting us

30:00.934 --> 30:01.856
to protect us.

30:01.936 --> 30:03.578
We're gonna meet him
tonight at midnight,

30:03.631 --> 30:04.876
and he's gonna
travel tonight.

30:05.008 --> 30:06.677
That's it.

30:07.001 --> 30:09.001
OK. On whose nickel?

30:09.067 --> 30:11.834
This spic cop doesn't take
American Express.

30:11.901 --> 30:13.067
It's already
taken care of.

30:13.134 --> 30:15.424
I told Mara
that Lem was in trouble.

30:15.477 --> 30:17.596
She felt very strongly
that we needed to help him.

30:17.649 --> 30:19.801
So we pulled a little
cash out of the house.

30:19.867 --> 30:22.034
I mean,
it's not a lot, but...

30:22.101 --> 30:23.870
Hey, 5 grand ought to
keep him in burritos and beer

30:23.896 --> 30:25.857
long enough, man.

30:26.201 --> 30:27.367
Yeah.

30:28.700 --> 30:31.134
All right.
Go get this cashed.

30:31.201 --> 30:32.433
Keep half of it
for tonight.

30:32.500 --> 30:34.234
Put the rest
on the wire.

30:39.034 --> 30:42.333
Lem must've said something
to Becca about Terry, too.

30:45.300 --> 30:47.700
All that gives Kavanaugh
is a little more suspicion.

30:47.767 --> 30:50.934
Doesn't mean
we're gonna catch a case.

30:51.001 --> 30:52.500
Let alone a needle.

30:52.567 --> 30:53.967
Lem starts talking,

30:54.034 --> 30:57.967
it puts teeth in an
otherwise empty rumor.

30:58.034 --> 30:59.101
These people,

30:59.168 --> 31:00.134
every time
they look at us,

31:00.201 --> 31:02.467
they're gonna see
two cop killers.

31:02.534 --> 31:03.834
That's on me.

31:03.901 --> 31:06.433
Terry was a decision
that we both made.

31:06.500 --> 31:07.467
I forced it on you.

31:07.534 --> 31:09.433
Now you're in
Kavanaugh's crosshairs.

31:09.500 --> 31:10.700
That's on me.

31:10.767 --> 31:12.168
Lem's gonna have to hide
under a rock

31:12.234 --> 31:14.034
for the rest of his life.
That's on me, too.

31:14.101 --> 31:15.201
I know that.

31:15.268 --> 31:17.071
And skewering yourself
is helping Lem how?

31:17.150 --> 31:18.934
How's that gonna help
any of us?

31:19.001 --> 31:20.268
You made a call,

31:20.333 --> 31:22.500
and that call was
to protect the team.

31:22.567 --> 31:24.534
That couldn't have
gone down any other way.

31:24.600 --> 31:26.934
It's done.

31:27.001 --> 31:28.234
It's done.

31:28.300 --> 31:30.767
Now is he still on our
side against Kavanaugh?

31:31.934 --> 31:33.300
I'm gonna find out.

31:36.276 --> 31:36.806
You!

31:36.946 --> 31:39.034
What the hell was that
pow-wow upstairs about?

31:39.101 --> 31:39.967
Call me later.

31:40.034 --> 31:41.700
I'm running out
of later.

31:41.767 --> 31:46.134
Now. Are you and me still
allies against Kavanaugh?

31:46.201 --> 31:47.567
Or do I pull out
my flame thrower

31:47.634 --> 31:49.300
and start that
scorched earth plan

31:49.367 --> 31:50.934
that I talked to you about?

31:52.534 --> 31:54.001
Becca's being
a good lawyer.

31:54.067 --> 31:56.001
Lem wants to
turn himself in

31:56.067 --> 31:57.634
if he can get his
original deal back,

31:57.700 --> 31:59.067
but Kavanaugh
won't sign off on it.

31:59.134 --> 32:00.667
He's gonna file
new charges

32:00.734 --> 32:01.896
for him running.

32:01.976 --> 32:03.512
I thought Kavanaugh
was out of the picture.

32:03.591 --> 32:05.366
He was until
Lem didn't show.

32:05.446 --> 32:06.767
And now,
the chief's believing

32:06.834 --> 32:08.404
that Kavanaugh was right.

32:08.457 --> 32:10.134
He's giving him back
all his power.

32:10.201 --> 32:11.067
What about Lem?

32:11.134 --> 32:12.667
He'll let him
twist in the wind?

32:12.734 --> 32:14.034
Claudette's gonna
call the D.A.,

32:14.101 --> 32:15.600
but she's waiting
as long as she can

32:15.667 --> 32:17.346
to give Kavanaugh a chance to find Lem.

32:17.426 --> 32:18.934
That's all I know.

32:19.001 --> 32:21.169
You got to throw
a wrench in the works.

32:21.248 --> 32:22.674
You wanted an inside guy
for intel.

32:22.727 --> 32:23.867
You got one.

32:23.934 --> 32:26.234
You need help aiding
and abetting a fugitive,

32:26.300 --> 32:28.168
find someone else.

32:40.967 --> 32:42.000
What happened
to your face?

32:42.067 --> 32:43.234
Nothing.
What happened to yours?

32:43.301 --> 32:45.100
Where were you
at 8 AM this morning?

32:45.167 --> 32:46.134
Driving. Working.

32:46.200 --> 32:48.768
On what,
your right cross?

32:48.833 --> 32:51.100
Witness says
you attacked Tori Birke.

32:51.167 --> 32:52.743
Also says you two
had an argument first.

32:52.823 --> 32:54.598
What was that about?

32:55.833 --> 32:57.601
You just think
you can go around

32:57.668 --> 32:58.800
beating women on the street?

32:58.867 --> 33:00.601
How do you know her?

33:00.668 --> 33:02.000
She take your cab?

33:02.067 --> 33:03.634
You stalking her
or something?

33:06.401 --> 33:08.434
OK, your thing is just
knocking the shit

33:08.501 --> 33:09.668
out of random,
total strangers.

33:09.734 --> 33:11.134
Works for me, Gilbos.

33:11.200 --> 33:13.401
So I...
so I picked up a hooker.

33:13.467 --> 33:15.100
I'm not the only guy

33:15.167 --> 33:16.567
who's had to
bust out of a slump.

33:16.634 --> 33:18.634
Doesn't mean I deserved
to get rolled and robbed.

33:18.701 --> 33:20.567
Say again?

33:20.634 --> 33:21.967
She set me up.

33:22.034 --> 33:23.100
Soon as I got
my clothes off,

33:23.167 --> 33:24.434
and my dick hard,

33:24.501 --> 33:25.833
These two black guys
ran in.

33:25.900 --> 33:27.567
Started
smashing me up.

33:27.634 --> 33:29.200
Took everything.

33:29.267 --> 33:30.734
The woman you attacked

33:30.800 --> 33:33.167
is a volunteer tutor
for at risk kids.

33:33.234 --> 33:34.658
She was on her way
to a session

33:34.711 --> 33:35.601
when you jumped her.

33:35.668 --> 33:37.701
That whore
flagged my cab.

33:37.768 --> 33:40.567
OK, offered me
anything in the book

33:40.634 --> 33:42.401
for a "C" note.

33:42.467 --> 33:43.701
Picked the motel.

33:43.768 --> 33:45.734
Then had her buddies

33:45.800 --> 33:48.701
steal my wallet and a
chain my mother gave me.

33:48.768 --> 33:50.933
So I gave her
a little payback.

33:51.000 --> 33:53.434
Arrest her ass,
not mine.

33:58.034 --> 33:59.768
So, did you find him?

34:00.410 --> 34:01.258
We did.

34:02.034 --> 34:06.967
Good. So I guess that means
that I can go now,

34:07.034 --> 34:09.034
and you'll just let me know

34:09.100 --> 34:10.434
if you need me
in court or anything?

34:10.501 --> 34:12.293
We talked to people
at the community center.

34:12.347 --> 34:14.121
You volunteer there
at least 3 days a week?

34:14.175 --> 34:16.034
Yeah. I read to
disadvantaged kids.

34:16.100 --> 34:19.100
Are you
a prostitute, Tori?

34:20.867 --> 34:23.900
Maybe in your fantasy
I'm a prostitute.

34:25.400 --> 34:26.501
All right,
you know what?

34:26.567 --> 34:28.668
If I'm gonna be insulted
on top of assaulted,

34:28.734 --> 34:30.534
I think I'd--
I think I'd like to leave.

34:30.601 --> 34:33.768
OK. We need to ask you
a few more questions.

34:33.833 --> 34:34.833
You're a suspect

34:34.900 --> 34:38.434
in a separate
assault and robbery.

34:41.601 --> 34:43.601
I'd like to see
my legal counsel.

34:46.167 --> 34:48.067
All right. They're moving
blow into the van.

34:48.134 --> 34:49.900
Still no sign of Guardo?

34:49.967 --> 34:52.467
They'll lead us to him.

34:57.067 --> 34:58.367
That's the second time

34:58.434 --> 34:59.900
that car's passed
by here tonight.

34:59.967 --> 35:01.734
What the Mexi chicks
in the el camino?

35:01.800 --> 35:03.933
They don't look like
Kavanaugh's boys.

35:04.000 --> 35:07.900
I think we're all right.

35:07.967 --> 35:09.375
Hey. Wire transfer
went through.

35:09.507 --> 35:11.153
Meet and greet
in TJ Is confirmed.

35:11.206 --> 35:12.796
Now he just need
to get Lem on board.

35:12.933 --> 35:14.367
OK, good.

35:14.434 --> 35:15.900
Almost home.

35:17.015 --> 35:18.207
They're on the move.

35:23.115 --> 35:23.618
Hey.

35:24.501 --> 35:26.768
Come on.
Pairing me up with Billings.

35:26.833 --> 35:28.100
You know a guy like that

35:28.167 --> 35:29.701
is gonna throw me
off my game.

35:29.768 --> 35:31.100
You'll adjust.

35:31.167 --> 35:33.334
I'm filing
for a transfer.

35:33.401 --> 35:34.367
Dutch.

35:34.434 --> 35:35.800
No. I'm serious.

35:35.867 --> 35:37.668
Things haven't been
the same between us.

35:37.734 --> 35:39.067
Even before
you got captain.

35:39.134 --> 35:41.601
There is no reason why
we can't work this out

35:41.668 --> 35:43.053
in a new way.

35:43.291 --> 35:44.934
Yes, there is.

35:45.013 --> 35:46.845
The only reason I was
hanging around here

35:46.871 --> 35:49.267
was because we were
partners, and that's gone.

35:49.334 --> 35:51.668
I'd just like
to move on.

35:52.121 --> 35:54.601
OK. I'll prepare
the paperwork.

35:54.668 --> 35:56.102
OK. Check this out.

35:56.200 --> 35:58.501
Tori has an MBA
from UCLA.

35:58.567 --> 36:00.867
Worked as an account
manager at a brokerage firm

36:00.933 --> 36:02.651
until she was fired
6 months ago.

36:02.704 --> 36:03.552
What for?

36:03.605 --> 36:04.833
Her work started
to get sloppy,

36:04.900 --> 36:06.384
and she stopped showing
up half the time.

36:06.464 --> 36:07.267
But no arrest.

36:07.334 --> 36:09.467
Yeah, if she's a hooker,
she had me fooled.

36:09.534 --> 36:11.401
And I can
usually smell them.

36:11.467 --> 36:13.434
This guy is here
for Tori Birke.

36:13.501 --> 36:15.701
I'm her legal counselor.

36:17.000 --> 36:18.401
And what are
your credentials

36:18.467 --> 36:20.355
Mr. Wallis, esquire?

36:20.401 --> 36:21.833
What I have
is a client.

36:21.900 --> 36:25.334
And I need to see her
immediately.

36:25.401 --> 36:27.234
Now, do I get to
see her now?

36:27.301 --> 36:29.167
Or do I file
for a dismissal?

36:31.401 --> 36:33.567
She's in 2.
Show him up.

36:36.334 --> 36:37.833
I'll check him out.

36:39.967 --> 36:41.967
I'm getting a whiff
of something now.

36:44.800 --> 36:47.567
Gallagher's DEA bozos are
tied up in a sting in Compton,

36:47.634 --> 36:49.167
and they're a little
short on cars.

36:49.234 --> 36:50.196
Maybe in a few hours.

36:50.276 --> 36:51.800
We can't wait that long.
We gotta meet Lem.

36:51.867 --> 36:53.189
What about back-up
from the Barn?

36:53.267 --> 36:54.336
There's a manhunt
on Curson.

36:54.401 --> 36:55.701
Byz-Lats shot
a grocery clerk,

36:55.768 --> 36:57.620
and there's no units
to spare.

36:59.601 --> 37:00.567
We gotta go in.

37:00.652 --> 37:02.867
There are 6 of them
at least.

37:02.933 --> 37:04.200
We don't know
how many more inside.

37:04.267 --> 37:07.034
Lem's gonna be
waiting on us.

37:07.100 --> 37:08.601
Who's coming?

37:22.900 --> 37:24.434
Get down!
Down on the ground!

37:24.501 --> 37:25.800
On the floor!
On the floor!

37:25.867 --> 37:27.000
Don't move!

37:27.067 --> 37:29.167
Get down on your knees.
Hands up!

37:30.668 --> 37:31.668
I got rabbits!

37:31.734 --> 37:32.933
Let them run.

37:33.000 --> 37:35.434
Get up. Let's go.

37:35.501 --> 37:36.434
Hands on your head.

37:36.501 --> 37:37.601
Hands on your head.

37:37.668 --> 37:38.701
You all right?

37:38.768 --> 37:39.734
Yeah.

37:39.800 --> 37:40.833
Let's go. Right now.

37:40.900 --> 37:41.867
On the ground.

37:41.933 --> 37:43.134
On the ground right now.

37:52.601 --> 37:54.167
How many of these things
these guys got?

37:54.234 --> 37:55.634
Claudette's so hot
for these guys,

37:55.701 --> 37:56.967
she can book them
herself.

37:57.034 --> 37:58.833
We gotta go get Lem.

38:01.401 --> 38:04.200
Yes, yes. I still
want to hold.

38:04.267 --> 38:05.933
Tyrez Wallis
is no more a lawyer

38:06.000 --> 38:08.301
than I am
a figure skater.

38:08.367 --> 38:09.267
Really?

38:09.334 --> 38:11.283
So Dutch's girlfriend's
got a pimp?

38:12.034 --> 38:14.367
You know, they've
been up there awhile.

38:15.833 --> 38:17.000
Dutch, let's go.

38:17.067 --> 38:18.281
No, no.

38:18.900 --> 38:20.900
I want the name of the
owner of these machines

38:20.967 --> 38:23.601
right now, or you will be
sitting in a holding cell

38:23.668 --> 38:25.601
for as long as it takes
me to track it down.

38:25.668 --> 38:27.467
Dutch, let's go.
Hang it up.

38:38.367 --> 38:40.267
You own those machines?

38:40.334 --> 38:41.634
I was just
filling a need.

38:41.701 --> 38:44.334
Isn't it illegal
for department employees

38:44.401 --> 38:46.967
to profit from things
like vending machines?

38:47.034 --> 38:48.634
Especially when you
use your position

38:48.701 --> 38:49.734
as acting captain

38:49.800 --> 38:52.334
to create a defacto
monopoly?

38:52.401 --> 38:54.340
I think it's more of
a gray area than that.

38:54.366 --> 38:55.501
I don't think so.

38:55.567 --> 38:57.833
I think it's more
black and white.

38:57.900 --> 38:58.833
All right, so what now?

38:58.900 --> 39:01.067
You gonna snitch me out
to Wyms?

39:01.134 --> 39:03.477
Like I haven't been
shithammered enough around here.

39:03.662 --> 39:06.073
Is that what this
is gonna be?

39:07.367 --> 39:09.367
I don't know what
I'm gonna do yet.

39:18.011 --> 39:19.733
Attorney/client privilege?

39:23.768 --> 39:26.601
It's illegal to practice law
in the state of California

39:26.668 --> 39:28.701
without a license,
counselor.

39:28.768 --> 39:29.867
What do you think?

39:29.933 --> 39:31.800
Did I need
anymore practice?

39:38.937 --> 39:40.606
Bomb Squad's
on a crank call

39:40.659 --> 39:41.900
at some westside
abortion clinic.

39:41.967 --> 39:43.367
They'll pick up
the grenades later.

39:43.434 --> 39:44.933
I told you to call in
every move.

39:45.000 --> 39:46.833
You were outnumbered
three to one.

39:46.900 --> 39:48.277
They were getting ready
to bolt.

39:48.303 --> 39:50.467
Split up in two vans.
We had no choice.

39:50.534 --> 39:52.833
Sorry I missed
all the action.

39:52.900 --> 39:55.334
Good work.

39:55.401 --> 39:57.134
Just wish we were able
to nail Guardo.

39:57.200 --> 39:59.401
He's been staying off
the frontlines these days.

39:59.467 --> 40:01.267
Probably feeling
the heat from you guys.

40:01.334 --> 40:03.634
Two busts
in as many weeks.

40:03.701 --> 40:04.900
He's feeling your heat.

40:04.967 --> 40:07.029
And I've seen what they
do when they get pissed.

40:07.082 --> 40:08.900
Better watch
your crown vics.

40:08.967 --> 40:12.234
You should be
warning him. Not me.

40:20.933 --> 40:22.167
Thanks.

40:26.007 --> 40:27.434
Glad you caught the guys.

40:27.501 --> 40:29.000
Actually, we didn't
nail Guardo.

40:29.067 --> 40:31.668
I'll see if I can
find something out.

40:31.734 --> 40:33.434
You find another tip,
find another buyer.

40:33.501 --> 40:35.267
Please don't be this way.

40:35.334 --> 40:37.867
I'm sorry I made that deal.
Helped Kavanaugh.

40:37.933 --> 40:38.867
You should go.

40:38.933 --> 40:41.900
I did it for Sebastio.

40:41.967 --> 40:44.900
You'd do the same thing
for your kids, too.

40:44.967 --> 40:45.900
Take your rat money,

40:45.967 --> 40:47.301
your retarded rat
baby kid,

40:47.367 --> 40:48.534
and get on
the first bus--

40:48.601 --> 40:51.367
Don't you say that
about my boy!

40:51.434 --> 40:52.286
What?

40:52.419 --> 40:54.867
You gonna let him talk
about Sebastio that way?

41:00.701 --> 41:02.200
I showed you mercy once,

41:02.267 --> 41:04.534
and it ruined
my friend's life.

41:04.601 --> 41:07.100
Not gonna happen again.

41:08.367 --> 41:09.567
Get out.

41:27.329 --> 41:30.434
The police committee is
willing to consider a deal.

41:30.501 --> 41:32.801
But like I thought, they
insist on adding more time.

41:32.868 --> 41:33.967
How much?

41:34.033 --> 41:36.320
Maximum of 10 years
with parole in 4

41:36.373 --> 41:38.028
if he turns himself
in immediately.

41:38.147 --> 41:39.134
What about
the safety issue?

41:39.200 --> 41:40.701
He'll be held in
protective custody.

41:40.768 --> 41:42.300
Until it's all
sorted out,

41:42.367 --> 41:44.300
but there's no guarantee
of location.

41:44.367 --> 41:45.900
Unless you can
prove your claims.

41:45.967 --> 41:47.567
What about the others?

41:47.634 --> 41:49.768
No condition about him
giving us something on them?

41:49.834 --> 41:51.911
We want to put this
behind us.

41:52.017 --> 41:53.567
Now if he's caught
before he comes in,

41:53.634 --> 41:54.900
all bets are off.

41:59.601 --> 42:00.801
Excuse me.

42:07.067 --> 42:08.868
What's going on, man?

42:08.933 --> 42:09.801
What was that?

42:09.868 --> 42:11.200
It wasn't my choice.

42:11.267 --> 42:13.601
It's what the police
committee wanted.

42:13.667 --> 42:15.334
If we don't find
Lemansky

42:15.401 --> 42:17.535
before he comes in,
or he gets out of the country,

42:17.588 --> 42:22.334
we're gonna lose our
last... chance at nailing Vic

42:22.401 --> 42:23.367
before this case
seals off.

42:23.434 --> 42:25.501
What do you want
me to do, Jon?

42:30.134 --> 42:32.868
He trusts you now, right,
when it comes to me?

42:32.933 --> 42:34.401
Maybe.

42:35.701 --> 42:38.067
I want you to scare him.

42:38.134 --> 42:40.401
I want you to make Vic
lead us to him.

42:40.467 --> 42:41.227
How?

42:43.768 --> 42:47.933
We both failed at trying
to nail Mackey

42:48.000 --> 42:49.134
on old business.

42:49.200 --> 42:50.100
They don't crack.

42:50.167 --> 42:53.334
They don't
turn on each other.

42:53.401 --> 42:55.300
Good for them.

42:58.000 --> 43:00.100
The way to get him

43:00.167 --> 43:01.801
is we gotta catch him
in the act.

43:01.868 --> 43:02.843
With Lemansky AWOL,

43:02.896 --> 43:04.670
Vic knows he's got eyes
and ears all over him.

43:04.723 --> 43:06.000
He's not gonna do
anything stupid.

43:06.067 --> 43:08.033
Unless he thinks he's got
one last mess

43:08.100 --> 43:09.033
to clean up.

43:09.100 --> 43:10.334
What mess?

43:10.401 --> 43:12.367
There's a detective
I spoke to here.

43:12.434 --> 43:14.601
He suspects
that the Strike Team

43:14.667 --> 43:16.234
robbed an Armenian
money train.

43:16.300 --> 43:17.567
Wagenbach.

43:17.634 --> 43:20.768
Yeah, but he doesn't
know it was Dutch.

43:20.834 --> 43:22.768
You gotta make him believe

43:22.834 --> 43:25.967
that Lemansky gave it up
for witness protection.

43:26.033 --> 43:28.567
It'll put him in motion.

43:28.634 --> 43:30.572
We follow him.
We catch him

43:30.599 --> 43:32.347
trying to help
Lemansky escape

43:32.427 --> 43:34.134
and nail them for
harboring a fugitive.

43:34.200 --> 43:36.067
It won't be the amount
of time that they deserve,

43:36.134 --> 43:37.701
but it'll be enough time

43:37.768 --> 43:39.701
to make them
lose their badges,

43:39.768 --> 43:42.200
and get them off the street.

43:42.267 --> 43:43.401
Catch them in the act.

43:43.467 --> 43:45.234
That's gonna
give us leverage.

43:45.300 --> 43:46.701
Lemansky, he may have
held his tongue,

43:46.768 --> 43:48.067
but the other ones,

43:48.134 --> 43:49.834
they might not
be as strong.

43:52.200 --> 43:53.234
David.

43:53.300 --> 43:56.300
It's time to put the mess
that Mackey made

43:56.367 --> 43:57.701
behind both of us.

44:03.868 --> 44:05.234
Lemansky's talking.

44:05.300 --> 44:06.501
That's bullshit.

44:06.567 --> 44:08.300
Is the Armenian
money train bullshit?

44:08.367 --> 44:09.667
Because that's what
he gave them.

44:09.734 --> 44:10.900
He's coming clean.

44:10.967 --> 44:12.601
There's nothing
to come clean about.

44:12.667 --> 44:14.601
That explains
where your 65,000

44:14.667 --> 44:16.337
unaccounted for
dollars comes from, huh?

44:16.390 --> 44:19.192
Look, he's tired.
He's scared.

44:19.378 --> 44:21.765
He doesn't want to die
at the hands of Antwon Mitchell.

44:21.818 --> 44:23.967
The D.A. said he's got to give
them something on the team.

44:24.033 --> 44:25.401
I guess he's agreed.

44:25.467 --> 44:27.267
Lem would never
agree to that.

44:27.334 --> 44:28.967
D.A. gave him no choice.

44:29.033 --> 44:31.000
He has to
give you guys up.

44:31.067 --> 44:33.401
And now all this bullshit
can blow back on me.

44:33.467 --> 44:35.567
Now you gotta get
a message to your boy.

44:35.634 --> 44:37.000
Tell him to
shut the hell up.

44:37.067 --> 44:40.100
Can you do that, hmm?

44:40.167 --> 44:41.810
If you can speak to him,
can you convince him

44:41.863 --> 44:44.089
to keep his mouth shut?

44:45.259 --> 44:45.975
Yes.

44:46.234 --> 44:49.367
Then do it,
for Christ's sake.

44:49.434 --> 44:51.701
I don't know
where he is.

44:51.768 --> 44:54.000
You know, Kavanaugh
is out of control.

44:54.067 --> 44:55.167
With Lemansky
unaccounted for,

44:55.234 --> 44:57.267
he's got
the chief's ear.

44:57.334 --> 44:58.667
And now the D.A.
is smelling blood.

44:58.734 --> 45:00.100
All of ours.

45:00.167 --> 45:01.514
I shouldn't be telling you any of this,

45:01.567 --> 45:02.918
but you've
threatened me,

45:02.945 --> 45:05.038
so now I've told you
everything I know.

45:06.601 --> 45:08.634
Now start
cleaning this up.

45:16.701 --> 45:18.734
We'll look the other
way on solicitation,

45:18.801 --> 45:20.734
but you gotta
make a statement

45:20.801 --> 45:23.967
about Spank's involvement in
the robbery and the beating.

45:24.033 --> 45:26.067
Do a little time yourself
for the stick-up.

45:26.134 --> 45:29.100
No. Spank wasn't there
when the cabbie got rolled.

45:29.167 --> 45:30.734
If you're
afraid of Spank,

45:30.801 --> 45:32.000
we'll protect you.

45:32.067 --> 45:33.033
He will not hurt you.

45:33.100 --> 45:34.401
You guys just see
pimp and hooker.

45:34.467 --> 45:35.601
That's not who we are.

45:35.667 --> 45:37.933
Yeah, says the hooker
letting pimp daddy

45:38.000 --> 45:39.447
drag her into
the shit with him.

45:39.553 --> 45:41.900
No, actually,
he dragged me out.

45:41.967 --> 45:43.033
He dragged me out

45:43.100 --> 45:45.567
of the steaming
shitpiles

45:45.634 --> 45:49.401
of a superficial,
empty...

45:49.467 --> 45:51.667
everything.

45:51.734 --> 45:52.834
And then
he hosed me off,

45:52.900 --> 45:53.967
and he held me.

45:54.033 --> 45:56.033
And he made me whole.

45:56.100 --> 45:57.834
I had nothing.
I was nothing.

45:57.933 --> 45:59.401
Before I met him.

45:59.467 --> 46:00.734
According to your sister,

46:00.801 --> 46:02.067
you had a pretty nice condo.

46:02.134 --> 46:06.200
You equate a roof
over your head to love?

46:06.267 --> 46:09.067
What exactly
does equal love?

46:13.801 --> 46:16.467
Do you see the wrinkles
on my face?

46:16.534 --> 46:17.734
Do you see them?

46:17.801 --> 46:18.493
Yes.

46:19.067 --> 46:20.634
Well, Spank doesn't.

46:23.434 --> 46:25.567
I understand you not
wanting to be away

46:25.634 --> 46:27.234
from your, uh...

46:27.300 --> 46:28.567
boyfriend.

46:28.634 --> 46:29.834
But what do you think

46:29.900 --> 46:31.501
is gonna happen
when you go to jail?

46:31.567 --> 46:33.000
Because we both know
that your man

46:33.067 --> 46:34.167
is just gonna
set his sights

46:34.234 --> 46:36.300
on the next piece of
Century City ass

46:36.367 --> 46:37.701
that comes his way.

46:37.768 --> 46:39.033
Shut your mouth!

46:39.100 --> 46:40.367
Shut your
goddamn mouth!

46:40.434 --> 46:42.134
Who do you think you are?

46:42.200 --> 46:44.367
You don't know us.

46:44.434 --> 46:45.667
You don't know us.
How dare you.

46:45.734 --> 46:47.033
Let go of me!

46:47.100 --> 46:48.933
No, no, no.
Let's just sit down.

46:49.000 --> 46:50.601
You don't know me!

46:50.667 --> 46:51.768
Let go of me.

46:51.834 --> 46:53.267
Sit down.

46:54.401 --> 46:55.834
The girl just gave you up.

46:55.900 --> 46:57.267
Says it was all
your idea,

46:57.334 --> 46:58.758
and you're the one
that beat up the John.

46:58.837 --> 47:00.667
I know that
didn't happen.

47:00.734 --> 47:03.200
Oh, she put the claws
in you, right?

47:03.267 --> 47:05.701
You shouldn't let no
woman do you like that.

47:05.768 --> 47:06.967
Someone like Tori.

47:07.033 --> 47:08.900
Smart, educated,
good job.

47:08.967 --> 47:10.801
How do you turn out
a girl like that?

47:16.067 --> 47:17.667
Any punk can get
some crack ho

47:17.734 --> 47:19.501
to go down on dick.

47:19.567 --> 47:22.100
But how do I get a little
pink toe from Westwood

47:22.167 --> 47:23.334
to do what I say

47:23.401 --> 47:25.900
whenever I say.

47:27.167 --> 47:30.167
Every chick's got a hole
in her heart.

47:30.234 --> 47:33.501
And it's connected to
the one between her legs.

47:33.567 --> 47:36.701
I just figure out
how to fill it.

47:36.768 --> 47:38.401
And then I feed it to her.

47:38.467 --> 47:40.367
And I keep
feeding it to her.

47:40.434 --> 47:42.334
'Til it's overflowing.

47:42.401 --> 47:44.667
Until she can't live
without it.

47:44.734 --> 47:47.667
And then,
I take it away.

47:47.734 --> 47:49.601
That makes me God.

47:50.701 --> 47:52.234
Tori was easy.

47:52.300 --> 47:54.234
Her fiance
left her last year

47:54.300 --> 47:55.900
for some young blood bitch.

47:55.967 --> 47:57.300
I just kept telling
old girl

47:57.367 --> 47:58.801
she was still
the prom queen

47:58.868 --> 48:00.534
like back in the day.

48:00.601 --> 48:01.985
And that white
faggot dude,

48:02.065 --> 48:03.667
he didn't have eyes
to see.

48:03.734 --> 48:05.667
Sooner or later,

48:05.734 --> 48:07.634
all bitches break.

48:07.701 --> 48:09.200
Every goddamn one.

48:09.267 --> 48:11.667
That's if you got game.

48:11.734 --> 48:13.667
And that's why
she's your whore?

48:13.734 --> 48:17.434
If you born a woman,
I can make you my ho.

48:17.501 --> 48:19.234
Which is why she's saying

48:19.300 --> 48:21.334
I had nothing to do
with no illegal shit.

48:21.401 --> 48:24.601
Now that y'all got some
pimpology,

48:24.667 --> 48:26.601
no charge,

48:26.667 --> 48:29.100
my black ass is out
of here, right?

48:42.834 --> 48:45.134
Anyone here believe
Lem cut a deal?

48:45.200 --> 48:48.200
Maybe he felt like
he had no choice.

48:48.267 --> 48:49.787
I mean, he's out there
in the wind alone.

48:49.867 --> 48:51.300
Becca's probably
pushing it.

48:51.367 --> 48:53.933
He has no idea about
this ranch in San Ignacio.

48:54.000 --> 48:56.401
Or the money we're gonna
be funneling to him.

48:56.467 --> 48:57.742
Becca told you
he took a deal?

48:57.815 --> 48:58.401
No.

48:58.467 --> 48:59.434
Aceveda.

48:59.501 --> 49:00.401
Aceveda?

49:00.467 --> 49:02.065
He's got a stake
in this, too.

49:02.144 --> 49:03.098
Not like we do.

49:03.151 --> 49:04.267
He could be
full of shit, man.

49:04.334 --> 49:05.334
Look, the truth is,

49:05.401 --> 49:06.801
we can't know what's inside Lem's head

49:06.868 --> 49:08.534
until we see him
face to face.

49:08.601 --> 49:09.952
We need an exit strategy.

49:10.005 --> 49:11.200
How are we gonna
get out of this?

49:11.267 --> 49:12.442
We don't need
an exit strategy.

49:12.495 --> 49:13.634
We need to fill Lem in.

49:13.701 --> 49:15.467
On the cash, the ranch.

49:15.534 --> 49:16.734
The lines
of communication.

49:16.801 --> 49:17.933
He's right.

49:18.000 --> 49:19.601
You know Lem,
he's been in the dark

49:19.667 --> 49:22.467
as much as we've been.

49:22.534 --> 49:23.667
And if Lem is talking,

49:23.734 --> 49:25.734
it's because he believes

49:25.801 --> 49:28.000
that Antwon has marked him
as a dead man

49:28.067 --> 49:29.467
behind bars.

49:29.534 --> 49:30.734
Now, once he knows

49:30.801 --> 49:32.801
what we've pulled
together for him,

49:32.868 --> 49:35.234
he'll go along.

49:39.100 --> 49:40.667
He will.

49:42.234 --> 49:43.768
We go to the spot.

49:43.834 --> 49:46.567
If he doesn't show...

49:48.300 --> 49:49.933
assume he made the deal.

49:50.000 --> 49:51.401
And then what?

49:51.467 --> 49:53.000
If he does show,

49:53.067 --> 49:56.634
then we'll
take his temperature.

49:56.701 --> 49:58.834
And make sure he's still
solidly on board.

49:58.900 --> 50:00.634
He'll be on board.

50:02.300 --> 50:03.734
Lem trusts us.

50:05.067 --> 50:06.334
He trusts us.

50:06.401 --> 50:08.534
And I still trust Lem.

50:09.254 --> 50:09.933
I do.

50:20.668 --> 50:21.734
Where's Vendrell?

50:21.800 --> 50:23.634
Shit. They're taking
different cars.

50:23.701 --> 50:25.200
I'll take Mackey.

50:44.900 --> 50:47.034
Ronnie, I got a tail.
I'm trying to lose him.

50:47.252 --> 50:49.914
- You sure?
- It's pretty far back but he's there.

50:50.020 --> 50:51.680
Watch your back, man.

50:55.967 --> 50:57.668
Looks like I got one, too.

50:57.734 --> 50:59.768
<i>Call Shane.
Give him a heads up.</i>

51:02.100 --> 51:03.134
Yeah.

51:03.187 --> 51:04.334
Vic and I
both have tails.

51:04.401 --> 51:05.334
Shit.

51:05.479 --> 51:07.439
Yeah, I'm looking.

51:07.545 --> 51:09.823
We gotta lose him without
looking like we're trying to lose him.

51:09.876 --> 51:11.042
Take your time.

51:11.095 --> 51:14.114
- We can't lead Kavanaugh to Lem.
- I don't see anyone on me yet.

51:14.194 --> 51:16.134
Vic says, whoever
loses his tail first,

51:16.200 --> 51:17.734
gets to Lem, moves him
someplace safe,

51:17.800 --> 51:19.334
'til we can all regroup.

51:19.401 --> 51:20.734
<i>Got it.</i>

51:58.734 --> 52:01.167
Jesus, am I glad to see you.

52:01.234 --> 52:02.567
Man, how you doing?

52:02.613 --> 52:04.370
- We gotta get out of here.
- What's going on?

52:04.423 --> 52:05.900
Kavanaugh's got a tail
on Vic and Ronnie.

52:05.967 --> 52:07.495
He could have an eye
up in the sky.

52:07.548 --> 52:09.167
Follow me to the old
body shop

52:09.234 --> 52:10.833
that closed down.
The one on Mission, OK?

52:10.900 --> 52:12.067
All right, man.

52:21.334 --> 52:22.833
Captain.

52:22.900 --> 52:26.833
I've been reviewing
officer Hanlon's package.

52:26.900 --> 52:28.967
Julien's T.O. report.

52:29.034 --> 52:31.768
You ignored a
recommendation for dismissal.

52:31.833 --> 52:34.668
Right. You know, with all
due respect to Julien,

52:34.734 --> 52:38.034
you'll find, as I did, that
he's a little tightly wound.

52:38.100 --> 52:39.367
Suffice it to say,

52:39.434 --> 52:40.634
I felt he was too tough
on Tina,

52:40.701 --> 52:42.101
and she deserved
a second chance.

52:42.154 --> 52:43.867
Two counts
of excessive force,

52:43.933 --> 52:45.634
contamination
of crime scenes,

52:45.701 --> 52:49.134
failure to identify an
undercover officer in the field.

52:49.200 --> 52:50.567
Seems more like
a sixth chance.

52:50.634 --> 52:52.200
She's still learning
her field work.

52:52.267 --> 52:54.167
But her instincts are good.

52:54.234 --> 52:57.034
That's why Dutch agreed
to take her under his wing.

52:59.000 --> 53:00.567
She's very intuitive.

53:03.267 --> 53:05.401
I'm calling
her PBA rep.

53:05.467 --> 53:07.334
Start the paperwork
for dismissal.

53:07.401 --> 53:10.100
You know, you may not
want to do that.

53:11.967 --> 53:13.900
Tina and I, we...

53:13.967 --> 53:15.467
made an arrangement.

53:16.768 --> 53:18.867
Someone was ripping off
the gourmet quick-mealer.

53:18.933 --> 53:20.034
I figured it was
an inside job,

53:20.100 --> 53:22.234
so I put a nanny cam
in the locker room.

53:22.301 --> 53:24.933
There are photos of officer
Hanlon in her skivvies

53:25.000 --> 53:27.000
that got out
into the world.

53:27.067 --> 53:29.291
The important thing is
is that Dutch and I

53:29.370 --> 53:30.768
handled it quietly
and efficiently.

53:30.833 --> 53:32.634
Uh, all I did
was find the pictures,

53:32.701 --> 53:34.267
bring them
to Steve's attention.

53:34.334 --> 53:35.267
I had nothing to do with--

53:35.334 --> 53:37.249
Oh, please, you helped
cover up this mess

53:37.302 --> 53:39.900
for a shot
in Hanlon's panties.

53:39.967 --> 53:41.032
Asshole.

53:41.085 --> 53:43.098
Look, you want to spend
your first month on the job

53:43.177 --> 53:44.601
overseeing
a full-time lawsuit?

53:44.668 --> 53:46.933
Ruining several careers,
Wagenbach's included?

53:47.000 --> 53:48.334
You go right ahead.

53:51.200 --> 53:52.367
Asshole.

54:21.768 --> 54:23.800
I never thought
it'd come to this.

54:26.933 --> 54:28.734
Hasn't come
to anything yet.

54:32.167 --> 54:33.401
What now?

54:34.634 --> 54:37.134
I'll go back and get
Vic and Ronnie.

54:37.200 --> 54:39.167
We got a way for you
to get to Mexico.

54:39.234 --> 54:41.000
What, like Gilroy?

54:41.067 --> 54:43.534
No, man.
The man died alone.

54:43.601 --> 54:44.601
I'm not going that route.

54:44.668 --> 54:46.100
You're not
a miserable drunk.

54:46.167 --> 54:47.467
It's gonna be different.

54:47.534 --> 54:49.833
No. It won't.

54:49.900 --> 54:51.167
It won't.

54:51.234 --> 54:53.367
Look, I'm not going.

54:55.000 --> 54:56.334
No more running.

54:56.401 --> 54:57.844
Oh, so you spend
the rest of your life

54:57.923 --> 54:59.933
looking over your shoulder
for Antwon Mitchell?

55:00.000 --> 55:01.100
You in Mexico
is the only thing

55:01.167 --> 55:02.634
that keeps us all safe.
Especially you.

55:02.701 --> 55:04.567
How the hell am I
going to live in Mexico?

55:04.634 --> 55:06.067
We got it all
figured out.

55:06.134 --> 55:07.134
How?

55:07.200 --> 55:08.134
San Ignacio.

55:08.200 --> 55:09.590
What the hell is that?
Some shithole?

55:09.670 --> 55:10.967
No, man. It's a ranch.

55:11.034 --> 55:12.534
Up in the mountains.

55:12.601 --> 55:15.367
We got a federale that's
going to get you there.

55:15.434 --> 55:16.367
It's beautiful, man.

55:16.434 --> 55:17.567
It's going
to be peaceful.

55:17.634 --> 55:19.098
We got money parked
in an account for you.

55:19.177 --> 55:20.167
It's all set up.

55:20.234 --> 55:23.200
Mara and I even kicked in
5 grand for you.

55:23.267 --> 55:25.768
I don't want that.

55:25.833 --> 55:26.867
It's just a start.

55:26.933 --> 55:28.601
We'll keep skimming
off the street, man.

55:28.668 --> 55:29.634
We'll keep you
hooked up.

55:29.701 --> 55:30.668
I can't.

55:30.734 --> 55:33.634
I can't.
I can't do that.

55:33.701 --> 55:36.501
It's all in play.

55:36.567 --> 55:37.900
Trust me, man.
It's gonna work.

55:37.967 --> 55:39.034
It's gonna work.

55:39.100 --> 55:42.234
There's a way for me
to take the hit solo.

55:42.301 --> 55:43.967
No, there's not, man.
No, there's not.

55:44.034 --> 55:45.401
Man, Kavanaugh.

55:45.467 --> 55:47.267
Aceveda, the D.A.

55:47.334 --> 55:49.234
There's no other
deal to make.

55:50.467 --> 55:52.534
They're gonna make you
give us up.

55:54.967 --> 55:58.198
Maybe not now.
Maybe a year from now.

55:58.304 --> 56:00.496
But man, you got one chance
to get out of here.

56:00.575 --> 56:03.867
Take it, man. Take that chance,
right now. Take it.

56:03.933 --> 56:05.334
I got it figured out.

56:16.501 --> 56:18.734
Why'd you even
come back here tonight

56:18.800 --> 56:20.634
if you weren't
planning on leaving?

56:20.701 --> 56:23.134
I came to see you guys.

56:25.534 --> 56:27.167
Don't do this, man.

56:28.134 --> 56:29.701
Look, where's Vic?

56:29.768 --> 56:31.267
I want to talk
to Vic.

56:32.634 --> 56:34.501
He'll call when
he loses his tail.

56:35.668 --> 56:38.200
We can't let Kavanaugh
catch us with you, man.

56:57.401 --> 56:59.167
Mara's pregnant again.

57:00.601 --> 57:02.167
No shit.

57:03.701 --> 57:06.452
Yeah, yeah.
Almost 3 months.

57:06.505 --> 57:08.501
I wasn't supposed to
say anything to anybody

57:08.567 --> 57:10.034
until next week,
but, uh...

57:10.100 --> 57:12.100
Hey, congratulations.

57:12.167 --> 57:13.634
Yeah. Yeah, yeah.

57:13.701 --> 57:16.000
That's another
mouth to feed.

57:21.501 --> 57:23.127
Mara's gonna be laid up
near the end,

57:23.207 --> 57:24.717
so I'm gonna have to...

57:25.432 --> 57:27.267
have to step it up,
you know?

57:31.034 --> 57:33.234
I hope I get to see
the little guy.

57:34.367 --> 57:35.601
Or girl.

57:37.467 --> 57:39.067
Little girl, huh?

57:40.234 --> 57:41.467
Yeah.

57:43.734 --> 57:45.434
Yeah. A little girl.

57:48.634 --> 57:50.634
Hey, I'm gonna
be all right.

57:51.867 --> 57:53.134
Shane.

57:54.367 --> 57:55.301
Yeah.

57:55.367 --> 57:56.334
Shane.

57:56.401 --> 57:58.334
I'm gonna be all right.

58:00.167 --> 58:02.234
It's all about
family, right?

58:08.401 --> 58:11.467
Look, what if Vic and Ronnie
can't shake the tail?

58:14.967 --> 58:17.070
Maybe they doubled back
to the Barn.

58:17.150 --> 58:19.640
I'll go check it out,
all right?

58:24.897 --> 58:26.000
Move your car.

58:26.067 --> 58:27.634
Get it out of sight.

58:34.644 --> 58:35.968
Did you get enough
to eat today?

58:36.074 --> 58:37.399
No, man. I'm hungry.

58:37.505 --> 58:38.750
I brought you some food.

58:38.882 --> 58:40.127
Thanks.

59:10.657 --> 59:12.169
Thanks, man.

59:16.611 --> 59:18.453
My favourite.

59:21.808 --> 59:23.934
Shane? Shane!

01:00:04.609 --> 01:00:06.121
I'm sorry.

01:00:11.507 --> 01:00:13.208
Shane...

01:00:17.177 --> 01:00:19.351
I'm sorry, buddy...

01:00:19.682 --> 01:00:22.233
I'm so sorry...

01:00:34.109 --> 01:00:34.798
Lem?

01:00:36.505 --> 01:00:38.773
Lem, I'm sorry!

01:00:39.937 --> 01:00:41.849
But I had to, right?

01:00:43.881 --> 01:00:47.703
But you know I'm sorry.
I'm so sorry, man.

01:00:59.486 --> 01:01:00.865
Oh, God!

01:01:37.878 --> 01:01:40.241
What are we gonna do
if Lem doesn't show?

01:01:40.347 --> 01:01:41.860
He's gonna show.

01:01:41.973 --> 01:01:43.258
He will.

01:01:52.302 --> 01:01:53.578
Hey...

01:01:54.901 --> 01:01:56.697
I had a tail.

01:01:56.813 --> 01:01:58.807
- Took me a while to shake it.
- Yeah.

01:01:59.085 --> 01:02:01.408
- Lem hadn't shown, huh?
- He's late.

01:02:02.492 --> 01:02:04.040
But he'll be here.

01:02:14.741 --> 01:02:15.554
Hey!

01:02:15.747 --> 01:02:17.393
It's your lucky day.

01:02:17.470 --> 01:02:20.594
The cab driver can't ID
and she won't testify against you.

01:02:21.058 --> 01:02:22.607
Only thing to testify about

01:02:22.684 --> 01:02:24.726
is my love for that girl right there.

01:02:24.823 --> 01:02:26.734
I'm gettin' you out of here soon, baby.

01:02:26.855 --> 01:02:28.670
Yeah, get yourself out of here.

01:02:28.776 --> 01:02:30.058
Take him out, will ya?

01:02:31.558 --> 01:02:32.816
Dutch,

01:02:32.937 --> 01:02:35.090
I spoke to your ex-partner,
the new captain,

01:02:35.213 --> 01:02:37.765
and she says
she trusts your instincts, so...

01:02:37.826 --> 01:02:40.280
she wants me to increase
the number of hours I trail you.

01:02:40.338 --> 01:02:42.990
I just wanted to say thank you
for putting in the good word.

01:02:43.067 --> 01:02:44.364
Yeah, sure.

01:02:46.265 --> 01:02:47.155
Okay.

01:02:49.227 --> 01:02:50.659
Hey, hmm...

01:02:55.285 --> 01:02:58.362
You know why you're gonna be
such a great detective someday?

01:02:58.691 --> 01:03:01.865
Because most people don't realize
how damn smart you are.

01:03:02.194 --> 01:03:03.994
They just see the surface.

01:03:04.157 --> 01:03:07.602
They cannot get paste your looks
to see what you're really about.

01:03:08.705 --> 01:03:10.157
I know, right?

01:03:10.234 --> 01:03:12.499
But you're not nearly
as smart as you need to be.

01:03:12.711 --> 01:03:15.324
The help I'm offering
doesn't come along every day.

01:03:15.421 --> 01:03:19.498
And if I'm gonna spend
my valuable time focusing it on you,

01:03:19.711 --> 01:03:20.981
well...

01:03:21.374 --> 01:03:23.884
you'd better make it worth my while.

01:03:25.246 --> 01:03:26.094
Sure.

01:03:26.525 --> 01:03:28.388
Definitely, of course.

01:03:31.339 --> 01:03:33.178
- What's going on?
- I don't know.

01:03:44.403 --> 01:03:46.096
- He did it.
- No.

01:03:49.629 --> 01:03:52.048
He's not coming.

01:03:52.822 --> 01:03:54.540
Maybe he had some heat on him,

01:03:54.637 --> 01:03:55.991
he had to hide.

01:03:56.137 --> 01:03:59.552
He's coming,
or he's gonna get a message to us.

01:04:00.070 --> 01:04:03.215
And we're gonna wait for him,
gonna give him more time.

01:04:03.685 --> 01:04:06.128
Kavanaugh could be
at our houses right now man,

01:04:06.225 --> 01:04:08.281
we have got to get out of here!

01:04:15.333 --> 01:04:16.325
Vic.

01:04:25.107 --> 01:04:26.486
Go home.

01:04:27.624 --> 01:04:30.285
Check around,
look for anything incriminating.

01:04:30.768 --> 01:04:32.679
Don't take any chances.

01:04:35.060 --> 01:04:35.728
No.

01:04:36.923 --> 01:04:38.447
We're gonna wait.

01:05:07.717 --> 01:05:08.597
Yeah?

01:05:14.313 --> 01:05:16.128
The transfert is denied.

01:05:16.249 --> 01:05:18.426
I need my best detective on this.

01:05:25.030 --> 01:05:26.434
Grenades.

01:05:26.627 --> 01:05:28.055
The thing this morning.

01:05:28.200 --> 01:05:30.934
El Salvadorans. The leader's missing.

01:05:31.055 --> 01:05:33.765
His name is Guardo.
Start there.

01:05:44.693 --> 01:05:46.120
Oh my God!

01:06:53.437 --> 01:06:55.784
Vic, Vic...
You can't touch anything.

01:07:40.354 --> 01:07:42.658
You're happy?

01:07:54.472 --> 01:07:57.425
Are you happy now,

01:07:57.602 --> 01:07:59.729
detective Mackey?

01:08:11.036 --> 01:08:13.190
Stop it!
Stop!

01:08:18.937 --> 01:08:20.788
Break 'em up!

01:08:20.902 --> 01:08:21.885
Come on.

01:08:23.813 --> 01:08:25.287
That's enough, come on.

01:08:28.501 --> 01:08:29.787
Break it up!

01:08:32.130 --> 01:08:33.604
Get off of him.

01:08:49.028 --> 01:08:51.372
Calm down, calm down...

01:09:07.033 --> 01:09:09.707
We're gonna find out who did this.

01:09:09.858 --> 01:09:12.277
And we're gonna kill him.

01:09:14.113 --> 01:09:16.113
