Okay. Let's rescue me.

12:02.805 --> 12:04.973
After all, I went back
to the past to save me,

12:04.974 --> 12:07.058
so now I'll stay
in the future to save me.

the same for me.

14:56.729 --> 14:58.606
Did you get a haircut?

15:00.775 --> 15:03.234
Yes! I also had
my body replaced

with a giant mainframe computer,

15:04.904 --> 15:06.905
so I can live forever.

I saw a chance to make sure
no one ever teased me again!
