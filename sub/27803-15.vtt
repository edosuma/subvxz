00:04.000 --> 00:05.661
[Helen]
Previously on Siren.

00:05.670 --> 00:07.535
[Ryn] It is time
to make baby.

00:07.540 --> 00:09.496
-Mating season?
-Important.

00:09.500 --> 00:12.287
We found out
why you and the others
aren't getting pregnant.

00:12.290 --> 00:15.168
-There are substances.
-Causmg fertility problems.

00:15.170 --> 00:16.740
[Kyle] We're interested
in the fertility research
you've been doing.

00:16.750 --> 00:18.411
It's important work.

00:18.420 --> 00:20.820
[Maddie] There are cameras
in the houseboat.

00:20.830 --> 00:21.876
[Kyle] There's nothing
that goes on in my lab

00:21.880 --> 00:23.324
I don't know about.

00:23.330 --> 00:24.786
So it's authentic?

00:24.790 --> 00:25.996
Who are you?

00:26.000 --> 00:28.457
I know something
bigger's happening here.

00:28.460 --> 00:30.109
Something with the military
and whatever creature
you guys caught?

00:30.120 --> 00:32.076
That's what I'm really after.

00:32.080 --> 00:34.708
[Ben] This is Ryn,
our other intern.

00:34.710 --> 00:36.029
Why Ben's mother hurt?

00:36.040 --> 00:38.110
She tried to get
some medicine.
It hurt her.

00:38.120 --> 00:39.530
I help Ben.

00:39.540 --> 00:42.418
Stem cells from a deepwater
marine creature?

00:42.420 --> 00:44.411
This new treatment
has re-energlzed me.

00:44.420 --> 00:46.456
I feel better
than I did before.

00:46.460 --> 00:48.746
[Helen] My family
has had a burial plot.

00:48.750 --> 00:51.287
I believe the military
raided that graveyard.

00:51.290 --> 00:54.919
If they analyze those bones,
they could ﬁnd us.

00:54.920 --> 00:56.035
[Xander]
I'm worried about Nicole.

00:56.040 --> 00:57.280
I've been trying to reach her.

00:57.290 --> 00:58.530
There's nothing, just crickets.

00:58.540 --> 00:59.916
I'll find her.

00:59.920 --> 01:01.035
[suspenseful music]

01:01.040 --> 01:02.029
Do I know you?

01:14.540 --> 01:17.532
[suspenseful music]

01:19.790 --> 01:20.996
Chris?

01:22.120 --> 01:24.497
It's me, Ben.

01:24.500 --> 01:26.377
[cartoon playing]

01:26.380 --> 01:27.950
From Bristol Cove.

01:30.420 --> 01:31.910
You've got the wrong guy.

01:31.920 --> 01:33.114
[sighs] No.

01:35.620 --> 01:36.575
All right.

01:36.580 --> 01:37.786
Here.

01:37.790 --> 01:38.950
Look.

01:40.080 --> 01:41.616
That's me.

01:41.620 --> 01:42.917
That's you.

01:43.960 --> 01:45.825
And Xander and Calvin

01:45.830 --> 01:47.161
at The Anchor.

01:48.830 --> 01:50.286
[Kyle] Ben?

01:50.290 --> 01:52.997
You're not authorized
to be in this area.

01:53.000 --> 01:54.911
What the hell is going on?

01:56.210 --> 01:58.201
Ben, you really need to leave.

01:58.210 --> 02:01.111
He says he knows me.

02:01.120 --> 02:03.372
It's okay.
I'll take care of it.

02:05.290 --> 02:06.416
What did you do to him?

02:12.710 --> 02:13.779
Bristol Cove?

02:19.210 --> 02:22.031
I am from Bristol Cove.

02:24.880 --> 02:28.077
[ominous music]

02:29.620 --> 02:32.111
[high-pitched call]

02:45.460 --> 02:46.575
Ryn?

02:47.710 --> 02:48.825
Are you all right?

02:50.380 --> 02:51.574
No baby.

02:54.210 --> 02:55.450
You can feel it?

02:55.460 --> 02:56.449
Yes.

03:04.960 --> 03:07.167
This happens
to humans, too.

03:07.170 --> 03:09.115
It can be hard
for us to get pregnant.

03:10.420 --> 03:11.409
Donna had a baby.

03:12.380 --> 03:13.369
Did you ever have one?

03:13.380 --> 03:15.166
No.

03:15.170 --> 03:17.115
Sister was older.

03:18.250 --> 03:21.242
Maybe when I was
ready for baby,

03:24.120 --> 03:26.202
You try?

03:26.210 --> 03:27.245
To have baby with Ben?

03:29.170 --> 03:30.990
Well, no, not yet.

03:31.000 --> 03:32.069
Why not?

03:32.080 --> 03:33.911
It's complicated.

03:33.920 --> 03:35.490
A big decision.

03:37.120 --> 03:39.031
Ryn, you can't give up.

03:40.460 --> 03:42.075
My aunt tried for many years.

03:42.080 --> 03:43.741
Eventually, it happened.

03:43.750 --> 03:45.160
How?

03:45.170 --> 03:48.662
Something called IVF,
a medical procedure.

03:48.670 --> 03:51.537
They take an egg from you
and fertilize it.

03:51.540 --> 03:55.533
Basically, they make a baby
outside your body with science.

03:55.540 --> 03:58.327
Then they place it
inside you to grow.

04:05.000 --> 04:06.536
[Kyle] After we got you
out of jail,

04:06.540 --> 04:08.201
Chris was in bad shape.

04:08.210 --> 04:09.575
You guys
just let him walk away.

04:09.580 --> 04:11.536
We found him,
brought him here.

04:11.540 --> 04:14.998
His EEG showed
disturbing changes
from that song.

04:15.000 --> 04:18.163
It was devouring
his frontal cortex.

04:21.830 --> 04:22.876
and we've been treating him.

04:23.880 --> 04:25.529
With what?

04:25.540 --> 04:28.612
The recording
that you captured
from the echo chamber.

04:28.620 --> 04:30.247
We've been exposing him
to it consistently

04:30.250 --> 04:31.615
over these past few weeks,

04:31.620 --> 04:33.372
and his recovery
has been remarkable.

04:33.380 --> 04:35.166
I'd like to see
hIS brain scans.

04:37.080 --> 04:38.160
Sure.

04:46.790 --> 04:49.031
The damage
has largely receded.

04:49.040 --> 04:50.109
It's a huge improvement.

04:50.120 --> 04:51.997
Except he can't
remember anything.

04:52.000 --> 04:54.241
We're hopeful
that'll improve over time.

04:56.170 --> 04:58.161
Maddie and I were exposed
to the echo chamber.

04:58.170 --> 04:59.740
We've had no memory loss.

04:59.750 --> 05:01.615
Chris' damage
was much more extensive.

05:01.620 --> 05:02.609
We've given him
many more treatments

05:02.620 --> 05:04.167
at higher intensity.

05:05.500 --> 05:08.071
Ben, it saved his life.

05:09.540 --> 05:12.031
Look, how much longer
you gonna keep him here?

05:12.040 --> 05:15.828
We're not keeping him
anywhere.

05:15.830 --> 05:17.320
He's free to come and go
as he pleases.

05:17.330 --> 05:18.740
He's chosen to stay.

05:18.750 --> 05:21.412
So I-- I can take him
with me right now?

05:21.420 --> 05:23.536
If he wants to go,
yes, of course.

05:23.540 --> 05:27.169
Might be good for him,
help jog his memory.

05:32.040 --> 05:34.417
[Helen] I'm so sorry
we've been put in danger.

05:34.420 --> 05:36.411
[Beth] We've prepared
ourselves for the worst,

05:36.420 --> 05:38.957
as we live in fear
of being discovered.

05:40.210 --> 05:41.871
Persecuted
for being different.

05:43.540 --> 05:46.282
[Helen] So you've created
a safe haven for yourself.

05:46.290 --> 05:47.450
For all of us.

05:47.460 --> 05:49.701
We have a plan in place.

05:49.710 --> 05:52.076
We'd go into hiding
if necessary.

05:52.080 --> 05:54.457
We're well supplied.

05:54.460 --> 05:56.997
Even our medical needs
could be handled from here.

05:57.000 --> 05:59.412
We have our own doctor,
one of us.

06:03.710 --> 06:06.611
Oh, I've been
self-diagnosing
and self-treating

06:06.620 --> 06:07.951
ever since I can remember.

06:11.120 --> 06:13.748
All of our babies
have been born right here.

06:15.290 --> 06:16.279
Even my own.

06:18.290 --> 06:20.167
It's good to know
you're prepared.

06:26.000 --> 06:27.570
What am I looking at?

06:27.580 --> 06:30.492
This is footage
taken the night of
the Klesco Oil attack.

06:30.500 --> 06:31.956
That's over 2,500 feet down.

06:31.960 --> 06:32.995
This isn't real.

06:33.000 --> 06:34.115
I had it authenticated.

06:34.120 --> 06:35.417
So what does that mean?

06:35.420 --> 06:36.990
I don't know.

06:38.250 --> 06:40.161
I can't explain it.
Here.

06:41.540 --> 06:43.201
Looks like there's
something on her face.

06:43.210 --> 06:44.700
Some kind of scales.

06:44.710 --> 06:45.995
It's weird, right?

06:48.210 --> 06:50.701
Ian, what's going on here?

06:50.710 --> 06:52.075
I have a theory.

06:52.080 --> 06:53.911
It's gonna sound crazy.

06:53.920 --> 06:57.117
I think that this girl,
or whatever she is,

06:57.120 --> 06:59.611
works for the military
and spearheaded
the attack on Klesco.

07:01.040 --> 07:02.371
I think
that she's some kind of

07:03.710 --> 07:05.075
government experiment.

07:05.080 --> 07:06.616
Like she's been, uh,

07:08.120 --> 07:09.030
altered or something.

07:09.040 --> 07:10.029
Altered?

07:11.580 --> 07:13.036
Something not natural.

07:15.290 --> 07:16.871
This is all the evidence
you have?

07:16.880 --> 07:17.915
For now.

07:17.920 --> 07:20.161
This isn't proof of anything.

07:21.290 --> 07:23.667
You want to know
what real evidence would be?

07:23.670 --> 07:25.114
Her.

07:35.080 --> 07:38.038
To do Ivy-Eff,
you say we need him?

07:38.040 --> 07:39.667
Just to be a donor.

07:39.670 --> 07:41.035
We'd need doctors, too,

07:41.040 --> 07:42.780
like at the military lab.

07:42.790 --> 07:45.247
It could get complicated
having them involved.

07:48.580 --> 07:49.660
Stop!

07:51.210 --> 07:52.029
He stays.

07:54.120 --> 07:55.200
You go back.

07:55.210 --> 07:56.825
Ryn, I'm not sure--

07:56.830 --> 07:58.036
Now.

08:14.540 --> 08:15.495
[snoring lightly]

08:15.500 --> 08:17.286
[tapping]

08:17.290 --> 08:19.030
Oh.

08:19.040 --> 08:20.780
Hey, did you, uh...
Did you find Nicole?

08:20.790 --> 08:22.530
No.

08:22.540 --> 08:24.030
But I found someone else.

08:27.080 --> 08:28.240
What the hell?

08:28.250 --> 08:30.070
-Chris!
-Hey.

08:31.790 --> 08:32.916
Chris,

08:32.920 --> 08:34.490
this is Xander.

08:36.120 --> 08:37.280
It's nice to meet you.

08:38.330 --> 08:39.456
Go on.

08:41.040 --> 08:44.112
Uh, yeah.

08:44.120 --> 08:46.327
Yeah, it's nice
to meet you, too.

08:48.670 --> 08:49.785
All right, come on.

08:56.580 --> 08:57.660
I'll explain later.

09:04.670 --> 09:06.206
[Chris]
So this is your place?

09:06.210 --> 09:08.826
Yeah. Go ahead.

09:08.830 --> 09:10.240
Check it out.

09:17.540 --> 09:18.871
You think being with us

09:18.880 --> 09:20.029
is gonna help him
get his memory back?

09:20.040 --> 09:21.667
It might.

09:21.670 --> 09:23.240
We don't know.

09:23.250 --> 09:25.320
But you and Maddie listened
to the same underwater noise.

09:25.330 --> 09:26.877
How come your memory
isn't shot?

09:26.880 --> 09:30.202
He had more treatments,
higher intensity.

09:30.210 --> 09:32.075
What if you and Maddie
need those treatments again?

09:32.080 --> 09:33.661
How are you sure
that this isn't

09:33.670 --> 09:34.876
how you two
are gonna end up?

09:34.880 --> 09:37.531
Honestly,
we don't know exactly

09:37.540 --> 09:39.417
what the military
did to him.

09:39.420 --> 09:41.160
There was no sign
of Nicole in there?

09:41.170 --> 09:42.819
No.

09:42.830 --> 09:44.206
You text her again?

09:44.210 --> 09:45.199
Yeah, like, 20 times.

09:48.250 --> 09:49.569
Go.

09:58.040 --> 09:59.450
We, uh...

09:59.460 --> 10:01.530
used to fish together.

10:02.540 --> 10:03.529
Oh, yeah.

10:03.540 --> 10:04.996
Yeah.

10:09.250 --> 10:10.820
Aw, shit.

10:10.830 --> 10:14.379
[ominous music]

10:28.880 --> 10:31.246
This is my dad.

10:32.250 --> 10:33.319
He had a boat.

10:34.380 --> 10:35.369
The North Star.

10:35.380 --> 10:36.779
Looks like a cool guy.

10:37.960 --> 10:39.029
I'd like to meet him.

10:41.210 --> 10:42.245
Yeah.

10:44.000 --> 10:45.240
He died.

10:47.000 --> 10:49.070
I'm... I'm sorry.

10:53.210 --> 10:54.666
When we were, uh,

10:54.670 --> 10:56.206
out on the boat,

10:59.420 --> 11:00.614
we came under attack.

11:02.250 --> 11:07.324
These things
came out of the water.

11:07.330 --> 11:08.490
It was all around us.

11:09.500 --> 11:10.615
[spear clanks]

11:12.540 --> 11:13.700
[grunts]

11:16.170 --> 11:18.070
[Donna shrieks]

11:20.080 --> 11:24.198
[singing Siren song]

11:24.210 --> 11:25.825
[knock on door]

11:30.880 --> 11:32.245
Hey.

11:32.250 --> 11:34.206
I got here
as fast as I could.

11:36.080 --> 11:37.069
How's he doing?

11:37.080 --> 11:38.069
He's not great.

11:41.170 --> 11:41.989
Hey.

11:42.000 --> 11:43.536
[Xander] Chris?

11:45.120 --> 11:47.076
This is Calvin.

11:47.080 --> 11:48.911
[Calvin] Hey, man,
I know you don't remember me,

11:48.920 --> 11:51.821
but I, uh...
I brought you some stuff.

11:51.830 --> 11:54.287
I know the memory's
been foggy, so

11:54.290 --> 11:56.326
I thought that
these things could help.

11:58.540 --> 12:00.167
Cap'n Crunch? Really?

12:00.170 --> 12:03.116
Yeah. They say taste and smell
triggers the memory.

12:04.120 --> 12:05.496
You loved this stuff, hmm?

12:05.500 --> 12:07.115
[cell phone chimes]

12:07.120 --> 12:09.202
Got you your favorite candy,
some snacks.

12:09.210 --> 12:11.201
You used to love all this.

12:11.210 --> 12:11.995
All your favorites.

12:13.000 --> 12:15.412
Check this out.

12:15.420 --> 12:16.910
What is this?

12:16.920 --> 12:18.569
It's your favorite beer.

12:20.830 --> 12:22.491
[chimes]

12:22.500 --> 12:25.708
Hey, I gotta go
see Maddie and Ryn.

12:25.710 --> 12:28.201
Right. Um, we're
gonna take Chris
to The Anchor.

12:28.210 --> 12:30.201
Hopefully,
it'll jog his memory.

12:30.210 --> 12:32.110
We got this.

12:32.120 --> 12:33.075
Okay.

12:33.080 --> 12:34.707
Keep me posted,
all right?

12:34.710 --> 12:36.200
-Let me know how he's doing.
-All right.

12:36.210 --> 12:37.780
It's good
to see you, man.

12:39.080 --> 12:40.786
We can't do this
with the military.

12:40.790 --> 12:42.530
Even if it was successful,

12:42.540 --> 12:44.781
they'd never let us transfer
the embryo back to Ryn.

12:44.790 --> 12:46.166
They'd want to control it.

12:46.170 --> 12:47.740
But is mine.

12:47.750 --> 12:49.706
They would grow the baby
in the lab without you.

12:51.000 --> 12:53.821
Maybe Nicole?
She can help?

12:53.830 --> 12:55.070
I don't know
where Nicole is.

12:55.080 --> 12:56.786
There's no one
you trust there?

12:56.790 --> 12:58.417
No, especially now.

12:58.420 --> 12:59.819
What do you mean?

12:59.830 --> 13:02.412
When I went back there,

13:02.420 --> 13:03.535
I saw some things.

13:06.080 --> 13:07.286
They did it.

13:08.290 --> 13:09.370
The graveyard.

13:09.380 --> 13:11.610
As we suspected.

13:14.460 --> 13:17.031
We'll do it without them
with our own doctors.

13:17.040 --> 13:20.077
We can't just take Ryn
to a fertility clinic.

13:20.080 --> 13:21.707
Beth. Her people.

13:21.710 --> 13:22.995
They have
their own doctors.

13:23.000 --> 13:24.661
Hi, it's Helen.

13:24.670 --> 13:26.160
A question.

13:26.170 --> 13:28.491
Can you tell me more
about the doctors
at the ranch?

13:28.500 --> 13:29.876
Ryn.

13:31.040 --> 13:33.873
I'm so sorry
about your sister.

13:35.040 --> 13:37.702
That is not my sister.

13:38.710 --> 13:39.699
Only her bones.

13:40.920 --> 13:41.989
Not...

13:43.830 --> 13:45.286
-her.
-Yeah.

13:47.920 --> 13:49.376
They took Chris, too.

13:49.380 --> 13:50.824
What?

13:50.830 --> 13:52.661
They grabbed him
before he went back to Iowa.

13:52.670 --> 13:54.376
They said
he was losing it.

13:54.380 --> 13:55.665
They've been treating him

13:55.670 --> 13:57.376
with the recording
we took down there.

13:57.380 --> 13:58.495
How is he doing?

13:58.500 --> 13:59.489
Not great.

14:01.040 --> 14:03.076
It's pretty much wiped
his memory.

14:03.080 --> 14:04.377
-[Maddie] Ben!
-I know.

14:04.380 --> 14:05.745
I know.

14:05.750 --> 14:07.536
We gotta make it
clear to them

14:07.540 --> 14:09.747
that they're
not in control of us.

14:09.750 --> 14:11.286
I pulled out the cameras,
all of them.

14:11.290 --> 14:12.530
Good.

14:12.540 --> 14:14.076
Okay.

14:14.080 --> 14:16.878
I'll let you know.

14:16.880 --> 14:18.245
What did she say?

14:18.250 --> 14:21.162
They could implant
the fertilized egg.

14:21.170 --> 14:24.207
But extracting the egg,
then fertilizing the egg,

14:24.210 --> 14:27.373
requires special equipment
and expertise they don't have.

14:27.380 --> 14:31.749
Okay, so let's have
the military do that part,

14:31.750 --> 14:34.878
then we'll get Beth's doctors
to transfer it to Ryn.

14:34.880 --> 14:38.202
You just said the military
isn't gonna hand
that embryo over.

14:38.210 --> 14:39.074
[Ben] They won't.

14:40.540 --> 14:41.780
We'd have to take it.

14:43.080 --> 14:45.378
[keyboard clicking]

14:47.920 --> 14:49.239
Ted, I thought
you left already.

14:49.250 --> 14:50.990
You're still here.

14:51.000 --> 14:53.377
Hey. Yeah.
Uh, just heading out.

14:53.380 --> 14:54.745
Back for dinner?

14:54.750 --> 14:56.911
Oh, well,
I'll do my best, sweetie.

14:59.920 --> 15:01.569
You okay?

15:01.580 --> 15:03.457
You touched my leg.

15:04.830 --> 15:05.876
Ted, I felt it.

15:08.250 --> 15:09.535
[gaSPSI

15:09.540 --> 15:10.780
Here?

15:10.790 --> 15:12.075
I definitely feel something.

15:25.580 --> 15:26.990
What do you think?
Get him some food?

15:27.000 --> 15:28.206
Yeah.
I think Janine's working.

15:28.210 --> 15:29.450
Maybe seeing her
will help.

15:29.460 --> 15:31.075
[Calvin] Yeah.

15:31.080 --> 15:34.572
[Siren song echoing]

15:49.620 --> 15:51.030
[Xander, distant sounding]
Chris?

15:54.540 --> 15:55.871
[echoing] Chris!

15:57.670 --> 15:58.876
Chris?

16:00.040 --> 16:01.246
You all right, man?

16:02.540 --> 16:03.996
Yeah.

16:06.040 --> 16:07.075
Yeah.

16:12.080 --> 16:13.991
[ominous music]

16:17.500 --> 16:19.456
The equipment will be
set up right away,

16:19.460 --> 16:21.917
then our doctors
can retrieve the eggs from Ryn.

16:24.040 --> 16:26.531
And as for the male sample?

16:27.880 --> 16:29.029
We'll have that.

16:31.000 --> 16:32.877
Look, at this point,
we should probably

16:32.880 --> 16:34.825
all put our cards on the table,
don't you think?

16:34.830 --> 16:36.286
Is this when you tell us

16:36.290 --> 16:38.531
about the cameras
you hid in my house?

16:38.540 --> 16:41.282
It's my job
to gather information
about these creatures,

16:41.290 --> 16:44.168
how they behave,
if they pose a threat.

16:44.170 --> 16:45.660
You crossed a line.

16:45.670 --> 16:48.036
But sometimes that's the cost
of gaining knowledge.

16:49.170 --> 16:50.910
How's Chris doing?

16:50.920 --> 16:53.662
Getting out of here
has been good for him.

16:53.670 --> 16:56.036
So that recording
that you got down there

16:56.040 --> 16:58.668
might just be the treatment
that he needed after all.

16:58.670 --> 17:00.820
You see?

17:00.830 --> 17:03.572
Good things happen
when we collaborate.

17:08.000 --> 17:09.490
Our doctor will be prepared

17:09.500 --> 17:11.616
as soon
as we receive the embryo.

17:11.620 --> 17:12.996
-Good.
-And, Helen,

17:13.000 --> 17:14.786
this is what
I wanted to share with you.

17:14.790 --> 17:16.951
There's a cleansing ritual
we have.

17:16.960 --> 17:19.167
It's something we've done
for many years in our community

17:19.170 --> 17:21.570
to help us overcome
our fertility issues.

17:21.580 --> 17:23.116
We want to give Ryn
the best chance

17:23.120 --> 17:24.826
at a successful pregnancy.

17:24.830 --> 17:27.116
That's very kind of you,

17:27.120 --> 17:29.168
but it's _ _
completely Ryn's deCI5ion.

17:29.170 --> 17:30.910
Of course.

17:30.920 --> 17:32.740
Would all members
of the community
be attending?

17:32.750 --> 17:34.206
Bryan won't be here.

17:34.210 --> 17:36.747
Fertility rituals
are female only.

17:36.750 --> 17:39.571
I'm sure Ryn would
want Ben to be here.

17:40.710 --> 17:42.575
Ryn can have
anything she wants.

17:51.210 --> 17:53.531
[ominous music]

17:55.500 --> 17:57.411
Excuse me. Hey!

17:57.420 --> 17:58.785
Hey.

18:01.120 --> 18:02.781
Uh, hi. Um...

18:03.920 --> 18:05.035
I'm sorry. I'm Ian?

18:05.040 --> 18:06.871
I'm a friend of Ben's?

18:06.880 --> 18:08.029
We met the other day.

18:08.040 --> 18:09.280
You're Ryn, right?

18:09.290 --> 18:10.496
Yes.

18:10.500 --> 18:12.206
Would you believe it?

18:12.210 --> 18:13.666
I was actually on my way
to Ben's right now

18:13.670 --> 18:14.876
to try and ﬁnd you.

18:14.880 --> 18:17.030
-Must be fate.
-Okay.

18:19.250 --> 18:20.990
Is, uh, something wrong?

18:22.000 --> 18:23.991
I can't find the service.

18:25.420 --> 18:27.706
Yeah, that's frustrating.

18:27.710 --> 18:29.871
You know, Ryn,
I'd like to talk with you.

18:29.880 --> 18:31.575
You are talking with me.

18:31.580 --> 18:35.038
No, I'm--
I'm interested in you.

18:35.040 --> 18:36.371
I'd like to learn
more about you.

18:37.790 --> 18:39.200
[cell phone rings]

18:39.210 --> 18:40.700
[Ryn growls]

18:40.710 --> 18:41.916
Hey, I can-- I can help.

18:41.920 --> 18:43.911
-I can help.
-[ringing]

18:43.920 --> 18:46.115
_ It's--
It's just your alarm.

18:46.120 --> 18:47.417
I'll just turn it off.

18:48.710 --> 18:50.371
Okay, yes.

18:50.380 --> 18:51.824
[ringing stops]

18:55.920 --> 18:58.241
There you go. All set.

18:58.250 --> 19:01.037
[ominous music]

19:01.040 --> 19:03.201
-So, uh, if you have the time.
-I go. Bye-bye.

19:11.080 --> 19:13.071
[Dr. Park]
You might feel it as a warm

19:13.080 --> 19:16.288
or a_kind of mild
electrical sensation.

19:17.790 --> 19:19.109
[beeping]

19:20.120 --> 19:21.166
Yeah.

19:22.250 --> 19:24.206
Moving down my leg
just a little.

19:24.210 --> 19:25.199
What does this mean?

19:25.210 --> 19:26.370
Seems some amount

19:26.380 --> 19:28.166
of nerve function
has been restored.

19:28.170 --> 19:30.035
But it's been weeks
since the treatment.

19:30.040 --> 19:33.112
Tissue repair
can be a slow process.

19:33.120 --> 19:35.076
So what do we do next?

19:35.080 --> 19:38.163
I recommend you come in
for a full neurological exam.

19:38.170 --> 19:39.535
And we'll discuss
starting you

19:39.540 --> 19:42.282
on another round
of stem cell treatments.

19:47.120 --> 19:49.111
Is this really happening?

19:54.540 --> 19:56.030
Let's not get
ahead of ourselves, okay?

19:57.290 --> 19:59.167
Let's take it_
one step at a time.

20:02.790 --> 20:04.951
All these years,
I've tried to push it away.

20:06.170 --> 20:07.785
Life before the accident,

20:08.880 --> 20:09.915
life after.

20:13.670 --> 20:14.739
Do you think about it?

20:16.710 --> 20:17.950
Every day.

20:21.880 --> 20:22.915
What is this?

20:22.920 --> 20:25.115
It's for him, for the...

20:26.120 --> 20:27.109
donaﬁon.

20:28.120 --> 20:30.281
You know, for him to...

20:30.290 --> 20:32.030
I think you're gonna need
to show him how to do it.

20:32.040 --> 20:33.530
I'm gonna show him?

20:33.540 --> 20:34.871
You want me to do it?

20:34.880 --> 20:36.370
No.

20:36.380 --> 20:38.166
Oh, for God sakes.

20:38.170 --> 20:39.535
I'll do it.

20:39.540 --> 20:42.111
Wait, you're gonna
do it with him?

20:42.120 --> 20:43.747
I'm gonna teach him
how to do it.

20:43.750 --> 20:45.206
The rest is up to him.

20:49.580 --> 20:51.161

[rock music playing
in The Anchor]

20:54.330 --> 20:56.286

remember this place?

Kinda. Spent
a lot of time here?

21:00.170 --> 21:02.115
[laughs] Yeah.

21:02.120 --> 21:03.246

I'd like to admit.

-What happened?
-You should lie down.

22:24.120 --> 22:27.169
It's good. They extracted
two eggs from you.

22:27.170 --> 22:28.910
That means
two chances for success.

22:28.920 --> 22:30.706
They're already ready.

it takes a lot longer
for fertilization.

22:34.830 --> 22:38.072
Yeah. They're about
to start the process.

22:38.080 --> 22:40.992
I will go to see this.

in the ultrasound
that I can see,

Now, on a scale
of one to ten...

24:00.710 --> 24:01.995
How much pain?

24:02.000 --> 24:03.319
No more pain.

24:03.330 --> 24:04.456
I feel better.

24:04.460 --> 24:05.996
Good.

24:06.000 --> 24:07.456
Some cramping is

24:07.460 --> 24:09.200
completely normal
after extraction,

24:09.210 --> 24:10.871
at least in humans,

24:10.880 --> 24:12.996
so that's probably
all that it was.

24:13.000 --> 24:14.490
Now, having said that,

24:14.500 --> 24:16.456
we don't know
how your body Will react,

24:16.460 --> 24:17.996
so I would feel better

24:18.000 --> 24:19.206
if you spent the night

24:19.210 --> 24:19.995
and you let us
observe you.

24:20.000 --> 24:22.992
No. I will go.

24:25.000 --> 24:27.070
There could be
complications.

24:27.080 --> 24:28.616
We'd like to keep
a close watch on her.

24:28.620 --> 24:30.076
We'll keep a close watch,

24:30.080 --> 24:31.286
call you
if anything happens.

24:31.290 --> 24:32.370
You got what you wanted.

24:32.380 --> 24:33.574
Let her go home.

24:36.170 --> 24:37.489
[hisses]

24:43.210 --> 24:45.371
Ben, when Ryn
is feeling better,

24:45.380 --> 24:47.166
we need to collect
some more stem cells from her.

24:47.170 --> 24:48.489
Why?

24:48.500 --> 24:49.706
Your mother didn't tell you?

24:49.710 --> 24:51.826
She's made
significant progress,

24:51.830 --> 24:53.991
and very soon,
she'll need another infusion.

24:56.210 --> 24:58.030
You must be so relieved.

25:08.380 --> 25:10.075
[Elaine's voice] Do you think
about the accident?

25:11.500 --> 25:13.320
-[splash]
-[Ted's voice] Elaine!

25:14.790 --> 25:16.451
[Elaine's voice]
Ted, help!

25:19.500 --> 25:23.038
[ethereal voice singing]

25:27.710 --> 25:28.995
[sighs]

25:42.080 --> 25:43.877
-Aaah!
-Ryn! Ryn!

25:45.000 --> 25:46.570
I am good at pretending.

25:46.580 --> 25:48.491
[both laughing]

25:48.500 --> 25:50.912
Got me that time.

25:50.920 --> 25:53.070
[laughing]

25:56.540 --> 25:59.668
[suspenseful music]

25:59.670 --> 26:02.571
-You have?
-It's in the bag.

26:03.540 --> 26:04.666
I hold.

26:07.790 --> 26:09.326
[Maddie]
Both eggs are in there.

26:09.330 --> 26:10.877
Thank you.

26:13.080 --> 26:15.116
What was Kyle saying
about your mother?

26:16.170 --> 26:18.616
Uh, that she was
doing better.

26:21.330 --> 26:22.991
As soon as he finds out
what we did,

26:23.000 --> 26:24.991
that'll be the end
of our relationship with him.

26:26.000 --> 26:27.536
Yeah.

26:27.540 --> 26:29.167
This is_ what matters
right now.

26:30.210 --> 26:32.417
For Ryn and her species.

26:38.000 --> 26:40.161
All the rest, we'll
just have to figure out.

26:46.750 --> 26:48.741
[breathing heavily]

26:48.750 --> 26:49.990
Stop it.

26:52.460 --> 26:54.451
Stop it!

26:56.380 --> 26:58.780
Hey, you all right, man?

26:58.790 --> 27:00.997
[rock music playing
in The Anchor]

27:01.000 --> 27:02.035
Yeah.

27:03.040 --> 27:04.200
I'm, uh...

27:05.830 --> 27:07.036
I'm feeling pretty tired.

27:09.040 --> 27:10.246
Well, let's take off.

27:10.250 --> 27:11.490
We'll head back to Ben's.

27:12.500 --> 27:13.489
Yeah.

27:15.670 --> 27:16.739
[phone chimes]

27:26.620 --> 27:28.110
Your call
has been forwarded

27:28.120 --> 27:30.111
_ to an automatic
v0ice message system.

27:30.120 --> 27:32.327
-[beep]
-Nicole.

27:32.330 --> 27:33.456
What's goin' on?

27:35.920 --> 27:37.035
I want to talk to you

27:37.040 --> 27:38.667
just to make sure
you're okay.

27:38.670 --> 27:41.116
So just call me back.

27:50.330 --> 27:53.037
Ben, you made
this plan for me.

27:53.040 --> 27:54.951
We all did.

27:56.080 --> 27:56.990
Thank you.

28:04.170 --> 28:05.819
[Beth] We're
so glad you're here.

28:08.380 --> 28:09.495
How are
you feeling, Ryn?

28:09.500 --> 28:10.706
Good.

28:10.710 --> 28:12.371
This is Leena,
our doctor.

28:12.380 --> 28:15.827
Hello. It's an honor
to meet you, Ryn.

28:15.830 --> 28:17.036
To meet all of you.

28:17.040 --> 28:20.077
I'm Maddie.
This is Ben.

28:20.080 --> 28:21.911
I'll take
good care of Ryn.

28:21.920 --> 28:23.069
I promise.

28:23.080 --> 28:24.206
[Beth]
We've had many births,

28:24.210 --> 28:25.700
many fertility treatments

28:25.710 --> 28:26.995
right here at this ranch.

28:30.330 --> 28:32.070
Yes. Ready.

28:42.080 --> 28:43.115
[exhales]

28:47.540 --> 28:48.609
[knocking]

28:52.920 --> 28:53.955
Ted.

28:53.960 --> 28:55.530
Hello, Susan.

28:55.540 --> 28:57.030
Can I come in?

29:02.540 --> 29:05.031
[ominous music]

29:08.500 --> 29:10.877
Would you mind
if I sit down for a sec?

29:10.880 --> 29:13.371
No. Not at all.

29:15.210 --> 29:16.996
Can I get you anything?

29:17.000 --> 29:19.036
Uh, water.
Water would be nice.

29:23.080 --> 29:23.990
[water pouring]

29:26.500 --> 29:27.615
Thanks.

29:31.040 --> 29:32.075
Been a while.

29:33.920 --> 29:36.070
Yeah.
Are the kids all right?

29:36.080 --> 29:37.115
Yeah, yeah.

29:38.790 --> 29:41.202
Yeah, this-- this is maybe
gonna sound a little strange,

29:41.210 --> 29:44.031
but, uh, do you
remember the night
of Elaine's accident?

29:45.040 --> 29:46.029
Of course.

29:46.040 --> 29:47.871
I was sitting in the ER.

29:47.880 --> 29:49.165
They just rushed
Elaine into surgery,

29:49.170 --> 29:50.910
then you and Dale
showed up.

29:50.920 --> 29:52.615
Yeah, that's right.
We were out to dinner,

29:52.620 --> 29:54.201
and Dale got a call
from the station,

29:54.210 --> 29:56.667
and we, um, took off
for the hospital

29:56.670 --> 29:58.035
right after.

29:59.880 --> 30:01.871
You sat with me,
waited with me.

30:03.920 --> 30:05.205
You were pretty messed up,

30:05.210 --> 30:07.917
probably in shock,

30:07.920 --> 30:09.069
a little drunk maybe.

30:11.170 --> 30:13.161
Do you remember
specifically what I said?

30:13.170 --> 30:15.035
Ted, it was ten years ago.

30:15.040 --> 30:17.998
I need to know.
Did I say anything
about what happened?

30:18.000 --> 30:18.989
It's important.

30:22.290 --> 30:25.418
[suspenseful music]

30:25.420 --> 30:28.207
You said you two
had been drinking,

30:29.210 --> 30:31.246
got into an argument.

30:31.250 --> 30:34.788
Then you lost control
of the boat.

30:36.460 --> 30:39.782
Elaine fell over,
you dove in after her,

30:41.460 --> 30:42.609
and then you said you...

30:43.790 --> 30:44.825
YOU saw someone.

30:46.040 --> 30:48.201
A woman
under the water.

30:48.210 --> 30:51.111
And not Elaine.
A-another woman.

30:52.420 --> 30:54.035
You said she attacked you.

30:55.420 --> 30:57.160
Doesn't make sense, right?

30:57.170 --> 30:59.491
Under the water at night,
how could I see anything?

30:59.500 --> 31:01.036
We're miles out to sea,

31:01.040 --> 31:02.701
and there aren't
any other boats around.

31:02.710 --> 31:06.373
Trauma sometimes,
twisting things
in our brains.

31:07.750 --> 31:09.115
Yeah.

31:09.120 --> 31:11.953
Woman under the water
doesn't make any sense.

31:13.250 --> 31:14.740
Thank you, Susan.

31:23.120 --> 31:24.166
How are you doing?

31:26.210 --> 31:27.245
I'm okay.

31:27.250 --> 31:29.707
Good days, bad days.

31:29.710 --> 31:31.166
Getting any work?

31:31.170 --> 31:34.207
Mmm. Not for a lack
of trying.

31:36.670 --> 31:38.535
_ Roberta in our office
is g0ing down to part-time.

31:38.540 --> 31:40.167
I might have
something for you.

31:41.040 --> 31:42.325
Okay.

31:44.500 --> 31:45.876
[door opens]

31:47.330 --> 31:48.536
[door closes]

31:50.380 --> 31:53.872
[disquieting music]

31:56.080 --> 31:58.571
-[Maddie, whispers] Wow.
-[Ben] Yeah.

32:01.580 --> 32:04.617
[Maddie] So this ritual,
what's it for?

32:04.620 --> 32:06.668
It's called shedding.

32:06.670 --> 32:09.412
Ryn's lower half
will be submerged
in seawater.

32:09.420 --> 32:11.615
Wait, you want her
to transform?

32:11.620 --> 32:12.826
Helen,
you didn't say this.

32:12.830 --> 32:13.956
It's too dangerous.

32:13.960 --> 32:15.245
I was hesitant, too,

32:15.250 --> 32:17.070
but just hear them out.

32:17.080 --> 32:19.162
When our people
are exposed to seawater,

32:19.170 --> 32:21.240
our epidermis begins to shed.

32:21.250 --> 32:24.617
A very thin layer of skin,
almost a film,

32:24.620 --> 32:26.611
simply releases
into the water

32:26.620 --> 32:29.748
and is immediately
replaced by a new layer,
a healthier one.

32:29.750 --> 32:32.662
That's not at all the same
as an actual transformation.

32:32.670 --> 32:35.161
When I change,
I am stronger.

32:35.170 --> 32:37.070
IfI am hurt, I get better.

32:37.080 --> 32:39.071
We want Ryn's body to be
as strong as possible

32:39.080 --> 32:40.411
for the implantation.

32:40.420 --> 32:42.615
[Maddie] Then she should
transform in the ocean.

32:42.620 --> 32:44.872
You've never done this before.

32:44.880 --> 32:46.450
Only half your body,

32:46.460 --> 32:47.575
we don't know
what might happen.

32:49.210 --> 32:50.108
I will be okay.

32:53.460 --> 32:55.200
You want me to trust you.

32:56.670 --> 32:58.206
Now you must trust me.

32:59.420 --> 33:00.614
I want to do this

33:01.830 --> 33:02.990
for the baby.

33:12.670 --> 33:14.206
[beeping]

33:31.120 --> 33:32.951
[line disconnected signal]

33:32.960 --> 33:35.076
We're sorry.
You have reached a number

33:35.080 --> 33:37.457

or is no longer in serwce.

these cleansing waters

35:11.880 --> 35:13.666
and that life may be created.

[bottle spritzing]

36:02.000 --> 36:03.035
Excuse me.

36:04.170 --> 36:05.876
The girl that was
staying in here,

36:05.880 --> 36:07.529
did she...
did she check out?

36:07.540 --> 36:09.280
I don't know.

36:09.290 --> 36:11.110
They tell me
to clean the room,
I clean the room.

36:12.710 --> 36:14.166
Yeah.

36:15.330 --> 36:16.991
Thanks.

36:20.670 --> 36:24.071
Hey. If it means anything,
I did see her.

36:24.080 --> 36:25.991
-Yeah?
-Yeah, a few days ago.

36:26.000 --> 36:27.911
I was cleaning
the room next door,

36:27.920 --> 36:29.456
and I heard voices.

36:29.460 --> 36:31.496
Kinda loud--
that girl and a man,

36:31.500 --> 36:33.377
arguing, you know.

36:33.380 --> 36:35.280
And then she left
with him.

36:35.290 --> 36:38.077
Didn't seem thrilled
about going.

36:38.080 --> 36:39.206
What, um...

36:39.210 --> 36:40.108
What'd he look like?

36:40.120 --> 36:41.872
Uh, had on a uniform,

36:41.880 --> 36:44.280
like in the Army
or something.

36:44.290 --> 36:46.576
I could get in trouble
for saying it,

36:46.580 --> 36:48.662
you know,
so if anyone asks.

36:48.670 --> 36:51.070
Yeah. Yeah, uh...

36:51.080 --> 36:53.492
You know what,
hey, thank you.

36:55.080 --> 36:56.320
Hope your friend's okay.

36:58.960 --> 37:00.029
Thank you.

Chris, you're back.

37:19.540 --> 37:21.167
Yeah.

37:21.170 --> 37:23.206
I can't be out there.

37:23.210 --> 37:24.108
I can't do it.

37:25.120 --> 37:26.246
It's okay.

37:26.250 --> 37:28.036
I understand.

37:28.040 --> 37:30.076
We'll take
good care of you.

37:34.040 --> 37:35.996
Are you doing okay?

37:36.000 --> 37:37.035
Fine.

37:37.040 --> 37:39.417
To see you
transform like that,

37:40.830 --> 37:42.240
it was magnificent.

37:43.250 --> 37:44.319
[door opens]

37:46.750 --> 37:48.206
[Leena]
How are you doing?

37:48.210 --> 37:49.199
Everything okay?

37:49.210 --> 37:51.826
Yes. I am ready for baby.

37:53.620 --> 37:55.030
What is that?

37:55.040 --> 37:57.031
That's just
a mild tranquilizer.

37:57.040 --> 37:58.325
Help her relax,

37:58.330 --> 38:00.161
stay still
for the implantation.

38:05.750 --> 38:07.741
It'll take a moment
or two to work.

38:07.750 --> 38:09.240
I'll be back.

38:11.080 --> 38:12.616
[door opens]

38:12.620 --> 38:13.666
[door closes]

38:22.250 --> 38:24.115
[ominous music]

38:24.120 --> 38:25.326
You'll feel drowsy
for a little while.

38:25.330 --> 38:27.036
Try to stay
as still as possible.

38:30.080 --> 38:32.116
The procedure
went exceptionally well.

38:34.290 --> 38:35.450
And Ryn?

38:35.460 --> 38:36.666
Not yet.

38:36.670 --> 38:38.877
I implanted
the first embryo in you.

38:38.880 --> 38:40.825
She'll receive the second.

38:40.830 --> 38:42.707
Okay.

38:42.710 --> 38:43.995
I'll pray for us both.

38:49.750 --> 38:50.819
[door closes]

38:57.500 --> 38:59.070
What are you doing here?

39:00.120 --> 39:01.951
This is a female ritual.

39:01.960 --> 39:03.109
And you include him?

39:03.120 --> 39:04.576
[Beth]
We needed his help.

39:04.580 --> 39:05.990
How did you know
about this?

39:08.210 --> 39:10.610
-I'm in charge here.
-Are you?

39:12.170 --> 39:14.661
This is supposed to be
a safe place for us,

39:14.670 --> 39:17.571
and you welcome him here,
a Pownall.

39:17.580 --> 39:20.378
She's choosing the family
that killed our people.

39:20.380 --> 39:21.824
We can't keep living
in the past,

39:21.830 --> 39:23.570
worrying about threats
that don't exist.

39:23.580 --> 39:24.990
It happened once.

39:25.000 --> 39:26.536
It'll happen again.

39:26.540 --> 39:28.326
Nothing good comes
from that family.

39:28.330 --> 39:30.378
That's not true.

39:30.380 --> 39:33.201
I've sacrificed
everything for us,

39:33.210 --> 39:34.575
to protect us.

39:36.620 --> 39:37.700
And I'm one of them.

39:39.040 --> 39:40.109
What do you mean?

39:40.120 --> 39:41.610
I am a Pownall.

39:41.620 --> 39:42.826
And so am I.

39:44.080 --> 39:46.992
[ominous music]

40:10.120 --> 40:12.076
How long have you
known this for?

40:12.080 --> 40:14.287
I only told her
the last time I was here.

40:14.290 --> 40:16.702
She's kept you safe
all these years.

40:16.710 --> 40:18.075
She deserves your trust.

40:18.080 --> 40:19.160
Not anymore.

40:19.170 --> 40:20.706
I'm going.

40:20.710 --> 40:22.746
Who's with me?

40:31.920 --> 40:32.989
[Bryan]
You'll regret this.

40:35.960 --> 40:36.949
[door opens]

40:39.460 --> 40:41.166
-[door closes]
-[Leena] Ryn!

40:45.210 --> 40:47.701
-She's gone!
-Come on!

40:47.710 --> 40:50.110
[female singer]
'Cause everybody talks

40:50.120 --> 40:51.417
[Ben] No! No!

40:51.420 --> 40:53.786
- Tell me your sin
-Ryn!

40:53.790 --> 40:55.109
Ryn!

40:55.120 --> 40:57.782
Nobody forgives

40:57.790 --> 41:00.372
Hey! Ian! Ian, stop!

41:00.380 --> 41:02.826
-Stop! Hey! Hey!
-[Maddie] Ryn!

41:04.420 --> 41:08.379
'Cause everyone is scared

41:08.380 --> 41:12.111
But nobody cries

41:12.120 --> 41:14.372
Nobody dares

41:14.380 --> 41:18.828
Speak to you

41:18.830 --> 41:21.071
[Warren] Ian, a call
this late better be good.

41:21.080 --> 41:22.206
You wanted evidence, right?

41:23.250 --> 41:24.490
I got it.

41:31.120 --> 41:34.203
[dramatic music]

41:36.580 --> 41:39.993
[music playing]
