00:03.729 --> 00:05.379
You try our patience.

00:06.129 --> 00:07.780
- What is done--
- Cannot be undone.

00:07.929 --> 00:09.539
I know. You keep saying that.

00:09.730 --> 00:12.400
But I need Doyle.
You can fold time. Bring him back.

00:13.330 --> 00:15.650
To what end?
To nullify his noble death?

00:16.329 --> 00:19.699
- To leave his atonement unfulfilled?
- If it means he lives.

00:20.530 --> 00:23.789
- He doesn't so that you may.
- You do so that others will.

00:25.929 --> 00:27.260
He's my friend.

00:27.730 --> 00:30.260
If that is so, then so
shall it ever be.

00:30.730 --> 00:34.060
- But it is of no consequence.
- The war rages on.

00:34.929 --> 00:37.670
Do not come to us again
on so self-serving a matter.

00:39.130 --> 00:42.750
There's one consequence,
even by your generous standards.

00:43.329 --> 00:45.609
He was my sole contact
to The Powers That Be.

00:46.329 --> 00:48.719
Without his visions,
I'm fighting blind.

00:49.329 --> 00:51.329
All will soon be made clear.

00:51.729 --> 00:54.469
For every door that closes,
another opens.

00:55.329 --> 00:56.909
And for every one that opens....

02:23.330 --> 02:25.150
- What are you looking for?
- Nothing.

02:28.129 --> 02:29.949
Doyle's special coffee mug.

02:31.129 --> 02:32.360
Doyle didn't have one.

02:34.729 --> 02:36.800
Don't you think he should've?

02:46.129 --> 02:48.409
I guess I thought
it would make me feel better...

02:48.530 --> 02:50.810
...if I could hold something
that he left behind.

02:51.530 --> 02:54.509
Some evidence he was here.
But there's nothing.

02:56.330 --> 02:57.270
Almost like...

02:58.129 --> 02:59.360
- ...like he never--
- Cordelia.

03:01.729 --> 03:02.780
Get out.

03:02.930 --> 03:04.860
- What?
- I mean, of the office.

03:05.930 --> 03:08.560
Take the day off. Go live a bit.
I can manage here.

03:08.930 --> 03:11.180
I know what you're doing, Angel.

03:12.530 --> 03:14.110
- What?
- You're pushing me away.

03:14.930 --> 03:16.580
- Close yourself off.
- That's not--

03:16.729 --> 03:19.259
I've got news for you.
We're all we've got now.

03:19.729 --> 03:23.699
You don't like sharing grief, but it's
the normal way of dealing with loss.

03:24.530 --> 03:28.780
I'm not going anywhere, so get used
to it. I'm staying right here.

03:31.129 --> 03:32.460
I gotta go.

03:33.530 --> 03:36.199
Audition. If it wasn't a national,
I'd blow it off.

03:37.729 --> 03:41.629
- Don't go if you don't feel up to it.
- Reverse psychology. Very cute.

03:42.530 --> 03:43.469
- I'm going.
- I'm not--

03:43.729 --> 03:46.750
- Don't get any ideas. I'll be back.
- Right.

03:49.729 --> 03:51.620
- You scared the heck out of me.
- You?

03:52.129 --> 03:54.090
I scared you?
Look in the mirror lately?

03:55.129 --> 03:56.639
Every chance I get.

03:57.530 --> 03:59.000
You're him, right?

03:59.330 --> 04:01.469
You're the guy.
The vampire with the soul?

04:01.729 --> 04:03.240
- I'm Angel.
- You gotta help me.

04:04.129 --> 04:07.639
Please. I mean that's what you do,
right? You help the helpless.

04:08.330 --> 04:11.069
You protect the, what do
you call them? The helpless.

04:11.930 --> 04:13.610
- Something like that.
- Should I stay?

04:13.729 --> 04:15.099
- That's okay.
- Break a leg.

04:16.129 --> 04:18.620
- Excuse me?
- I sense a little performance anxiety.

04:19.129 --> 04:22.319
- Little trick, picture everybody--
- In their underwear.

04:23.329 --> 04:27.120
I was gonna say dead. But, hey,
if that underwear thing works....

04:27.529 --> 04:28.649
So...

04:31.129 --> 04:33.129
- ...what's the problem?
- Call me Barney.

04:33.529 --> 04:37.850
First off, you should know,
before there's any misunderstanding...

04:38.930 --> 04:39.800
...I'm a demon.

04:41.329 --> 04:44.949
- I appreciate your candor.
- Secondly, it's 3:45 in the afternoon.

04:45.529 --> 04:48.019
Middle of the day.
Why aren't you in your coffin?

04:49.730 --> 04:52.399
Coffin. I hate that stereotype.

04:53.930 --> 04:56.879
- Do you know anything about vampires?
- What I learned from TV.

04:57.529 --> 05:00.019
Vampires don't use coffins.
It's a misconception...

05:00.529 --> 05:02.110
...made by writers and the media.

05:02.329 --> 05:05.589
We can move around as long as
we avoid direct sunlight. Got it?

05:06.529 --> 05:09.129
Sorry. Didn't want to push
any sore spots.

05:12.569 --> 05:14.959
Okay, let's try this
whenever you're ready.

05:16.769 --> 05:17.709
Action.

05:17.970 --> 05:20.990
Look at this wine stain.
I can't meet your folks like this.

05:21.569 --> 05:25.220
Don't worry, honey. It's no problem
with extra-strength StainBeGone.

05:25.769 --> 05:28.050
- Extra-strength StainBeGone?
- Yep.

05:30.569 --> 05:34.709
Now StainBeGone is more
effective at melting away...

05:35.370 --> 05:38.850
...stubborn blood, wine...

05:40.170 --> 05:42.199
...even grass stains.

05:43.170 --> 05:44.290
See?

05:44.970 --> 05:47.139
Just spray it on...

05:49.170 --> 05:50.779
...and rub it in...

05:53.370 --> 05:54.949
...and in minutes...

05:56.370 --> 05:58.160
...the stain is gone.

05:58.769 --> 06:01.050
It's completely gone.

06:08.970 --> 06:11.180
- Okay, that was....
- Good. That was good.

06:11.370 --> 06:12.420
- Very nice.
- Good, good.

06:13.170 --> 06:15.800
But I think what we're
going for is more of a--

06:16.170 --> 06:17.290
- Happy.
- Happy, yeah.

06:17.970 --> 06:20.850
- An "up" feeling about cleaning.
- Because stains are--

06:21.569 --> 06:22.730
- Not good.
- Exactly.

06:22.769 --> 06:24.139
I'm sorry.

06:24.569 --> 06:27.620
It's an interesting choice.
Let's try again. We'll go from:

06:28.170 --> 06:30.490
- "StainBeGone is more effective."
- Yeah.

06:35.370 --> 06:37.120
Now, StainBeGone...

06:39.569 --> 06:41.430
...is more...

06:41.970 --> 06:42.980
...effective!

06:44.370 --> 06:45.740
Grass stains!

06:50.370 --> 06:51.910
- Okay, nice adjustment.
- Thanks.

06:52.170 --> 06:53.399
We'll let you know.

07:04.170 --> 07:07.079
- What's hunting you?
- I don't know. But whoever it is...

07:07.769 --> 07:09.769
...he's unstoppable, like a machine.

07:10.170 --> 07:13.009
Been on my tail through a few states.
Ever since Phoenix.

07:13.769 --> 07:16.750
Pulled out all the stops to shake him,
but he keeps on coming.

07:17.370 --> 07:18.949
You think he means you harm?

07:19.170 --> 07:22.500
He's not tracking me to tell me
I won the Publishers Clearinghouse.

07:23.970 --> 07:25.230
He's an assassin,

07:27.569 --> 07:29.250
- Is he a demon?
- He could be,

07:29.970 --> 07:32.430
He knows all the hangouts.
Wherever I go...

07:32.970 --> 07:36.480
...he's just a step behind. It's a
miracle I've eluded him this long.

07:46.769 --> 07:47.850
Why you?

07:48.569 --> 07:50.529
- What do you mean?
- Who are you?

07:50.970 --> 07:53.740
That's what I'm saying.
I'm nothing. I'm a nobody.

07:54.569 --> 07:58.329
I'm just a guy trying to get by.
No different from everybody else.

07:59.370 --> 08:02.420
Been my experience that when one
is being pursued tenaciously...

08:02.970 --> 08:06.300
...it's because the pursuer
has a strong grievance.

08:07.170 --> 08:09.730
Hey, I never said I was a boy scout.

08:10.769 --> 08:13.750
I'm an Empath demon.
I can read emotions.

08:14.370 --> 08:18.939
Gives me a slight advantage at cards.
Blackjack, poker, and for the fights.

08:20.370 --> 08:21.350
So you're a cheat.

08:21.569 --> 08:23.990
I think of it as going
with my strengths.

08:24.569 --> 08:27.519
Look, whatever. I'm a demon.
Sure, I'm evil.

08:28.170 --> 08:31.009
But, hey, I'm not, you know, "evil."

08:41.970 --> 08:43.830
You don't have beef with anyone?

08:44.370 --> 08:48.200
No one. But like my old man always
said, "Can't please everybody."

08:49.169 --> 08:50.850
So you gonna help me?

08:55.529 --> 08:56.370
Hi.

09:01.529 --> 09:02.860
Everything okay?

09:11.129 --> 09:11.830
Okay.

09:14.129 --> 09:18.100
Cordelia, that was--
I think you're acting out of grief.

09:18.929 --> 09:21.389
- You're confusing our--
- I didn't feel anything.

09:21.929 --> 09:25.230
- Did you feel anything?
- No, that's what I'm trying--

09:25.529 --> 09:29.149
That means that I still have it.
I can't believe he did this to me.

09:30.330 --> 09:31.529
- Who did what?
- Doyle.

09:31.529 --> 09:34.649
I thought our kiss meant something.
Instead, he used the moment...

09:35.730 --> 09:39.240
...to pass it on to me. Why couldn't
it have been mono or herpes?

09:39.929 --> 09:43.549
I didn't ask for this responsibility,
unlike some who shall remain lifeless.

09:44.129 --> 09:45.570
I have nothing to atone.

09:45.929 --> 09:49.370
If they know what's good for them,
The PTB better stay out of my head.

09:50.129 --> 09:51.250
Powers That Be.

09:53.730 --> 09:55.379
- You had a vision.
- Boy, howdy!

09:55.529 --> 09:58.860
You know how they look painful?
They feel a whole lot worse.

10:00.330 --> 10:01.980
Another door opens.

10:03.929 --> 10:07.090
- You're my link to The Powers now.
- I'm nobody's link.

10:07.529 --> 10:11.779
I lost control of my entire central
nervous system with that vision.

10:12.929 --> 10:16.440
And I'm not certain, but I think
I may have drooled a little.

10:17.129 --> 10:19.759
- It's my first audition in weeks.
- What was it?

10:20.129 --> 10:23.220
StainBeGone. A national, no less.
Probably never call me again.

10:23.730 --> 10:26.570
- What was the vision?
- Who knows? It was a thing.

10:27.330 --> 10:30.419
- A thing?
- An ugly, gray, blobby thing.

10:31.529 --> 10:35.179
- What difference does it make?
- This could be a dangerous thing.

10:35.730 --> 10:38.639
I want it out. If kissing's
the only way to get rid of it...

10:39.330 --> 10:42.379
...I will smooch every damn frog
in this kingdom.

10:44.129 --> 10:45.710
Oh, thought I heard voices.

10:47.129 --> 10:50.360
Barney, you remember
my associate, Cor--

10:52.529 --> 10:53.299
--delia?

10:54.330 --> 10:55.490
Maybe not every frog.

10:55.529 --> 10:59.710
Boy, I gotta say, I like the way
you people treat your clients.

11:00.929 --> 11:01.909
Excuse me.

11:06.929 --> 11:09.700
- He's a client?
- Something's after him.

11:10.529 --> 11:13.409
- The ugly, gray, blobby thing?
- You tell me.

11:14.730 --> 11:18.309
Try sketching it. In the meantime,
Barney would feel safer downstairs.

11:18.929 --> 11:19.629
Babysit him.

11:20.129 --> 11:21.740
- Where are you going?
- His apartment.

11:22.529 --> 11:24.700
He thinks it knows where he lives.

11:27.929 --> 11:31.480
Behave yourself. I don't want to
find you two necking on the couch.

13:05.129 --> 13:06.809
Hello, Angel.

13:08.929 --> 13:10.159
Wesley.

13:10.730 --> 13:15.049
- Never thought you'd see me again?
- I didn't think about it. What are--?

13:15.529 --> 13:16.440
Hup, hup, hup.

13:17.330 --> 13:20.950
I'm the one asking questions here.
And I think it only fair to warn you:

13:21.529 --> 13:24.019
Any sudden movement
and I'll be forced to--

13:24.529 --> 13:25.610
Right.

13:26.929 --> 13:28.470
You had a question?

13:33.529 --> 13:36.830
Interesting look for you.
Motorcycle.

13:37.730 --> 13:40.009
The Watchers' Council
trying out a new image?

13:41.929 --> 13:44.840
In point of fact,
I no longer work for the Council.

13:46.730 --> 13:51.049
I believe I am of greater value
to the cause, working autonomously.

13:52.129 --> 13:54.899
- They fired you.
- Hardly.

13:55.129 --> 13:57.200
With Buffy unwilling
to follow orders...

13:58.129 --> 14:01.110
...there was no opportunity
to function as Watcher.

14:02.330 --> 14:04.889
And that's why I became
a rogue demon hunter.

14:05.929 --> 14:08.740
- You're a demon hunter?
- Rogue demon hunter, yes.

14:09.529 --> 14:11.919
I'm on the trail of
a nasty bugger right now.

14:11.929 --> 14:14.419
- I suggest you stay out of my way.
- Easy, tiger.

14:15.529 --> 14:19.500
I think you're making a mistake.
This demon seems harmless to me.

14:20.330 --> 14:23.139
He's left a trail
of mutilated corpses.

14:23.330 --> 14:26.419
- Mutilated?
- Each victim possessed a unique power.

14:27.529 --> 14:30.440
Telepathy, poisoned tongues,
healing hands.

14:31.129 --> 14:35.129
The physical source of their power was
ripped and torn from their corpses.

14:35.330 --> 14:38.840
- He's collecting powers.
- To what purpose, I can only guess.

14:40.129 --> 14:43.110
The fiend's cut a swath
across half the continent.

14:43.730 --> 14:46.500
Almost caught it in Phoenix.
Got a fair look too.

14:46.730 --> 14:50.940
- Kind of short? Ruddy complexion?
- Short? No, on the contrary.

14:52.129 --> 14:55.179
Quite enormous and powerful.
More of a yellow-green.

14:55.730 --> 14:58.539
It seems to be secreting
some sort of viscous fluid.

14:59.929 --> 15:01.370
Like that?

15:46.850 --> 15:50.399
I hear drawing can be very therapeutic
during a grieving period.

15:51.049 --> 15:53.399
- What?
- I'm sorry.

15:54.649 --> 15:56.370
Couldn't help sensing your pain.

15:57.649 --> 16:00.250
You just lost someone
close to you, didn't you?

16:01.250 --> 16:04.090
- Angel told you?
- No, I'm empathic.

16:04.850 --> 16:07.340
I feel your feelings
when you feel them.

16:07.850 --> 16:12.059
- It's a gift my kind is blessed with.
- Really? My kind believes in privacy.

16:13.850 --> 16:17.149
You shouldn't nose around other
people's feelings without asking.

16:18.649 --> 16:22.970
You're right. I'm sorry.
Just trying to make conversation.

16:24.049 --> 16:25.169
Wait.

16:26.450 --> 16:27.429
Barney, I'm sorry.

16:28.250 --> 16:31.409
I'm just going through a difficult
time right now. I'm just--

16:31.850 --> 16:33.080
Missing your friend.

16:36.049 --> 16:38.220
- Why don't you tell me about him?
- Doyle?

16:40.250 --> 16:43.620
He drank too much and his taste
in clothing was like a Greek tragedy.

16:46.850 --> 16:48.919
And he could be really
sweet sometimes.

16:49.850 --> 16:54.129
You'll like this. He was half demon,
a secret he kept from me forever.

16:54.649 --> 16:56.970
I guess that's why he
sometimes smelled weird.

16:59.450 --> 17:01.309
You remind me a little of him.

17:02.450 --> 17:04.410
I'll take that as a compliment.

17:07.250 --> 17:08.410
That's him.

17:09.049 --> 17:10.700
- Barney.
- He's after me!

17:11.450 --> 17:12.529
Barney, it's okay.

17:13.250 --> 17:14.650
The books are over there.

17:18.049 --> 17:20.368
Good lord. Cordelia?

17:21.049 --> 17:24.769
Angel never mentioned.
Well, what a nice...

17:36.650 --> 17:37.730
...surprise.

17:40.250 --> 17:42.880
- Didn't work!
- No?

17:45.049 --> 17:46.910
I think it went
better than last time.

17:47.450 --> 17:50.470
No. It was just a kind of experiment.
I was trying....

17:51.650 --> 17:52.450
Wesley?

17:52.849 --> 17:55.309
What are you doing here?
Are you working with Angel?

17:55.849 --> 18:00.420
A lone wolf never works with anyone.
I'm only allowing Angel to assist me.

18:01.849 --> 18:04.730
- Wow.
- I'm a rogue demon hunter now.

18:06.650 --> 18:07.980
Wow.

18:09.049 --> 18:10.130
What's a rogue demon?

18:10.849 --> 18:14.400
So you're saying, all this time
your friend wasn't hunting me...

18:15.049 --> 18:18.140
- ...but what was hunting me?
- That's about the size of it.

18:18.650 --> 18:21.630
- Why is the other thing after me?
- It wants your empathic ability.

18:22.250 --> 18:24.319
The feeling feelings thing?

18:24.650 --> 18:27.599
- What kind of demon would do this?
- A Kungai.

18:28.849 --> 18:31.170
- Kungai?
- The description matches.

18:31.250 --> 18:33.039
It's of Asian origin, very deadly.

18:33.650 --> 18:37.269
"A powerful race of demons,
the Kungai possess a Tak horn...

18:37.849 --> 18:40.730
...capable of consuming
its opponent's life force."

18:42.650 --> 18:46.160
- We're lucky to have escaped alive.
- Hey, I know these Kungais.

18:46.849 --> 18:48.150
They're relentless killers.

18:48.650 --> 18:50.680
- You gotta take it out.
- I'm on it.

18:51.049 --> 18:52.799
I have to find it first.

18:57.049 --> 18:58.559
Hang on. It's of Asian origin.

18:58.849 --> 19:01.690
I tracked it through
an Asian district just north of here.

19:02.450 --> 19:04.869
- Koreatown.
- It's very likely it's hiding there.

19:05.450 --> 19:08.259
- That's where I'll start looking.
- Don't you mean "we"?

19:09.650 --> 19:12.000
- I work alone, Wesley.
- The hell, you say.

19:12.650 --> 19:14.230
This demon is mine. Angel!

19:15.650 --> 19:18.839
I know how to track him.
You're not catching him without me.

19:19.849 --> 19:21.390
I had somebody at my side.

19:22.849 --> 19:23.829
He's dead now.

19:24.650 --> 19:28.130
I won't let that happen again.
I work alone.

19:29.450 --> 19:32.150
- You don't even know where to start.
- I have an idea.

19:36.049 --> 19:37.380
Yes.

19:39.650 --> 19:40.809
Well.

19:42.650 --> 19:46.900
- Are you all right, Wesley?
- No. These pants chafe one's...

19:49.250 --> 19:50.480
...legs.

20:52.089 --> 20:54.720
Hey, do you know where they
do the shiatsu massages?

21:02.890 --> 21:04.220
That's kind of nice.

21:05.289 --> 21:07.009
- What is it?
- I don't know.

21:07.089 --> 21:10.180
I don't know! I don't know.

21:11.289 --> 21:12.900
You're frustrated.

21:14.289 --> 21:16.750
That's one spooky talent.
You can just look at me...

21:17.289 --> 21:21.359
...grinding my teeth, grunting,
and sense that I'm frustrated?

21:22.089 --> 21:25.069
- Amazing.
- It's good at sensing sarcasm too.

21:26.890 --> 21:28.990
- Can I help?
- Only if you can explain...

21:29.289 --> 21:31.079
...why I have to suffer
splitting migraines...

21:31.690 --> 21:34.569
...getting visions so vague
they require closed captioning.

21:35.289 --> 21:37.009
What do you mean, visions?

21:38.890 --> 21:42.890
My friend Doyle used to get
brain flashes, messages from The PTB.

21:45.490 --> 21:46.569
The Powers That Be.

21:46.690 --> 21:49.289
Visions of all sorts of stuff.
People in trouble...

21:49.690 --> 21:52.150
...things causing trouble,
places trouble's happening.

21:52.690 --> 21:56.759
- And he left you that inheritance?
- I'm never gonna forgive him.

21:58.089 --> 22:00.509
What? Choosing you?

22:01.690 --> 22:04.740
Trusting you with an enormous
responsibility?

22:05.289 --> 22:07.779
Believing that you were
the only one worthy...

22:08.289 --> 22:10.569
...of such a rare and important gift?

22:11.289 --> 22:13.250
Did I mention the drooling?

22:13.690 --> 22:17.549
I get the impression Doyle didn't
have much by way of possessions?

22:19.089 --> 22:21.859
No. No, he didn't.

22:23.289 --> 22:26.480
Seems like he gave you
the most valuable thing he had.

22:44.890 --> 22:48.049
I hope you like your coffee black,
because the boss's lightener...

22:48.490 --> 22:51.299
- ...is O-positive.
- Black is great.

23:00.490 --> 23:01.750
Hank, it's me.

23:02.289 --> 23:05.269
Of course I got the Kungai horn.
In a safe place.

23:05.890 --> 23:06.900
But listen...

23:08.890 --> 23:11.240
...I think I just found something
even better.

23:26.250 --> 23:30.039
It's strong and a little clumpy.
I can't brew the old-fashioned way.

23:31.049 --> 23:34.349
I'm more the "auto-drip." Sorry.

23:34.650 --> 23:35.910
Yes, you are.

23:37.650 --> 23:40.319
- What?
- Sorry. Pathetic, really.

23:41.250 --> 23:44.269
Thanks for that insight,
Mr. Emotional Radar.

23:44.849 --> 23:46.670
- How old are you?
- That's none--

23:47.250 --> 23:49.710
Twenty-something?
With your head in the clouds...

23:50.250 --> 23:52.920
...and your feet in shoes
you can't afford...

23:53.849 --> 23:56.380
...all self-absorbed,
full of regret.

23:56.849 --> 24:01.420
Poor little Cordelia with her
delusions of an acting career.

24:02.250 --> 24:06.640
- Delusions?
- You don't think you'll succeed?

24:07.650 --> 24:10.210
- You're a terrible actress.
- You've never seen me.

24:10.650 --> 24:15.039
- How could you possibly know?
- Because you know. You feel it.

24:17.250 --> 24:21.319
Your entire being is whispering it
to me right now.

24:22.650 --> 24:26.509
Me, on the other hand?
You must admit I'm a fine actor.

24:26.849 --> 24:27.829
Fooled you.

24:31.049 --> 24:34.670
You dislike the truth. No wonder
Doyle never showed his demon half.

24:35.849 --> 24:38.940
You don't know anything
about me or Doyle.

24:39.450 --> 24:41.029
I know you let him die.

24:43.049 --> 24:46.809
- That is not true.
- No, but it feels true, doesn't it?

24:47.849 --> 24:51.990
Mixed in with all the pain and grief,
a healthy dollop of guilt.

24:52.650 --> 24:56.480
A nagging thought that, somehow,
you could've saved him.

24:56.849 --> 25:00.150
If you'd been nicer to him.
If you'd let your walls down.

25:01.049 --> 25:03.859
If only for one freaking second...

25:04.650 --> 25:08.269
...you gave a damn about anyone
besides yourself, huh?

25:08.849 --> 25:10.150
- Let me--
- Shut up!

25:10.650 --> 25:13.460
So you hate your gift, the visions?

25:13.650 --> 25:18.220
You'd love to rip those pretty eyes
out of your head. I know I would.

25:38.849 --> 25:41.519
- I don't know your language.
- I do.

25:42.450 --> 25:44.240
I think I recognize the dialect.

25:45.450 --> 25:46.920
Then it's good you came by.

25:49.650 --> 25:53.970
- The wound wasn't fatal.
- It wasn't. Look at his head.

25:55.049 --> 25:56.769
His Tak horn's broken.

25:59.250 --> 26:02.230
Not...stick...not...not dying...

26:03.450 --> 26:06.500
...horn. I think he's trying
to say his horn was taken.

26:07.049 --> 26:08.769
Yes, but by whom?

26:09.450 --> 26:13.559
Good. Terror. I feel it.
You have no idea what a rush it is.

26:14.250 --> 26:15.410
Keep it coming.

26:16.049 --> 26:17.210
The horn was taken.

26:21.450 --> 26:26.119
His horn was taken for something.
The "Klu-Ka." I don't know that word.

26:28.049 --> 26:31.000
Yes. Fish...fish will die...

26:31.049 --> 26:34.670
...not fish.... More...die more?
Oh. He says more will die.

26:35.849 --> 26:38.339
- Okay, how? Who?
- No good losing patience.

26:38.849 --> 26:40.599
He's dying and I'm not fluent.

26:44.250 --> 26:47.160
A vision. I'm having a vision.

26:48.450 --> 26:52.519
A demon! A creepy, little--
You! It's definitely you!

26:53.250 --> 26:55.500
- You're in great, great--
- Danger?

26:56.250 --> 26:57.299
Pain.

27:01.650 --> 27:05.829
I really don't want to hurt you.
Bruises bring down the price.

27:07.650 --> 27:08.519
Help!

27:11.250 --> 27:12.650
But not by much.

27:13.650 --> 27:16.279
Hit the cherry? Slam the cherry?

27:17.849 --> 27:20.690
Oh, no. Oh, dear. Stop?

27:21.450 --> 27:24.359
Stop the demon? Red...

27:25.650 --> 27:27.539
...heart...reader.

27:35.250 --> 27:37.599
He was trying to describe his killer.

27:38.250 --> 27:41.269
Demon...heart...reader....

27:41.849 --> 27:43.359
Empath demon.

27:44.849 --> 27:46.109
Barney.

28:20.730 --> 28:24.589
That's too much trouble.
I'll get the eyes and dump the body.

28:24.930 --> 28:28.619
We get an extra thousand if
the seer's eyes are intact. Drop it.

28:30.329 --> 28:31.490
Fine.

28:33.329 --> 28:36.349
- Shouldn't you be cataloging flesh?
- Yeah, whatever.

28:39.930 --> 28:41.089
Cordelia!

28:42.930 --> 28:43.980
Cordelia!

28:48.930 --> 28:51.599
- This is all my fault.
- We both left her here.

28:51.930 --> 28:53.230
Neither of us knew.

28:54.329 --> 28:58.259
I should have. All this time,
I've been tracking the wrong demon.

28:58.529 --> 29:02.319
- If anything happens to her--
- It won't. I won't allow it.

29:14.130 --> 29:17.609
This is me, looking for a clue.
Feel free to join in.

29:18.329 --> 29:19.869
I'm a fraud.

29:21.329 --> 29:22.910
The Council was right to sack me.

29:26.130 --> 29:27.880
Yes, I was fired.

29:28.529 --> 29:31.130
I had two. Two slayers in my care.

29:32.130 --> 29:36.269
One turned evil and is now in a coma.
The other's a renegade.

29:36.930 --> 29:40.259
Fire me? I'm surprised
they didn't cut my head off.

29:45.930 --> 29:47.400
I'm useless.

29:50.130 --> 29:51.640
A fool.

29:52.529 --> 29:55.690
- A sniveling, great--
- Ugly, gray, blobby thing.

29:56.130 --> 29:59.079
Yes, I'm an ugly, gray, blobby--
What?

30:00.329 --> 30:03.380
It's a sculpture by Van Gieson.
Maiden with Urn,

30:03.930 --> 30:06.839
Cordelia's vision.
Could be where Barney took her.

30:07.529 --> 30:11.710
So we ascertain this sculpture's
whereabouts, Cordelia's whereabouts.

30:12.329 --> 30:14.750
- Then you rescue her.
- We rescue her.

30:15.329 --> 30:19.329
I need you. The Kungai said Barney
wanted the horn for something.

30:20.130 --> 30:21.210
"Klu-Ka."

30:21.930 --> 30:25.549
You're the only one here who can
translate that. You with me?

30:29.130 --> 30:30.140
Good.

30:32.289 --> 30:33.339
Got it.

30:35.289 --> 30:39.079
Maiden with Urn was sold
to the Ramsey hotel chain in '82.

30:40.089 --> 30:42.720
Twelve hotels around here.
It's got to be in one.

30:43.089 --> 30:45.619
I keep finding
a translation for Klu-Ka...

30:46.089 --> 30:49.880
...which translates as "caller sale,"
whatever that means.

30:51.490 --> 30:54.299
Caller. Caller sale.

30:55.690 --> 30:58.670
Yes, of course!
I know what Klu-Ka is.

30:59.289 --> 31:00.869
- What?
- "Auction."

31:01.089 --> 31:04.950
Sold! For 20,000 to number 118,
the dapper gentleman in the aisle.

31:05.890 --> 31:09.119
Well done. You are the proud owner
of an authentic Tak horn.

31:09.490 --> 31:12.369
Stab your enemies with it.
It'll drain the life out of them.

31:14.890 --> 31:16.849
An investment in peace of mind.

31:17.289 --> 31:19.500
Next up, lot 32.

31:19.690 --> 31:22.109
We're very lucky
to have this here today...

31:22.690 --> 31:25.250
...a rare and beautiful find.

31:30.490 --> 31:32.420
I'm not a seer!
I had a vision once...

31:32.890 --> 31:34.990
...and I'm sure it was
something I ate.

31:35.289 --> 31:37.960
The magnificent eyes of a seer.

31:40.690 --> 31:42.759
Your own pipeline
to The Powers That Be.

31:43.089 --> 31:45.970
The possibilities are endless.
Keep her as a slave...

31:46.690 --> 31:49.250
...remove the head as a trophy
or harvest the eyes.

31:50.289 --> 31:51.410
In any case...

31:51.490 --> 31:55.000
...a unique party icebreaker.
It doesn't get any better than this.

31:55.690 --> 31:58.950
We'll start the bidding at 2000,
do I hear 2000?

32:00.490 --> 32:02.519
Two thousand. Do I hear 2500?

32:03.490 --> 32:05.950
Two thousand and five.
Do I hear three? Three.

32:11.930 --> 32:15.160
Eight thousand, do I hear nine?
Eyes of a seer, folks.

32:16.130 --> 32:18.759
I don't have to tell you
what a rare find this is.

32:19.130 --> 32:21.589
Nine thousand.
Nine gets me 10.

32:22.130 --> 32:23.779
Do I hear 10? 10,000?

32:24.529 --> 32:26.210
Ten thousand, do I hear 10?

32:27.529 --> 32:30.059
Ten thousand! Do I have 11 ?
11,000?

32:30.529 --> 32:32.880
Eleven thousand from
the gentleman in the back.

32:33.529 --> 32:34.650
Do we have 1 2?

32:35.329 --> 32:39.579
Seer's eyes going at 11,000,
do I hear 12?

32:40.730 --> 32:42.869
Ramsey Hotel, recently redecorated.

32:43.730 --> 32:45.900
The Van Gieson sculpture
used to be there.

32:48.529 --> 32:50.529
Eleven thousand it is.

32:50.930 --> 32:53.210
Going for 11,000 once, twice--

32:53.329 --> 32:55.150
Hey! You'd pay double for cataracts.

32:55.730 --> 32:59.240
My eyes are flawless even without
visions! That's the best you can do?

33:04.130 --> 33:06.410
I have 12,000 from the gentleman.

33:07.130 --> 33:09.589
Do I hear 13? Thirteen?

33:10.130 --> 33:12.759
- Going for 12,000--
- You know what these eyes can do?

33:13.130 --> 33:16.640
They can see stuff, like danger...

33:17.329 --> 33:21.259
...and evil, and locations
of buried treasure!

33:23.930 --> 33:26.529
Thirteen thousand. Do I hear...?

33:28.130 --> 33:31.079
Have some huevos, guy!
Whitey here's stepping all over you.

33:32.329 --> 33:34.289
You gonna take that from his kind?

33:35.930 --> 33:36.910
Fourteen.

33:37.730 --> 33:38.430
Fifteen.

33:38.930 --> 33:40.650
Sixteen, 17.

33:41.329 --> 33:42.940
- You decide,
- Eighteen.

33:43.730 --> 33:44.849
Nineteen.

33:48.529 --> 33:50.849
Twenty thousand from
the gentleman in the center!

33:51.529 --> 33:53.700
Going once, going twice--

33:54.529 --> 33:55.470
Thirty thousand!

33:57.529 --> 34:00.200
Sold for $30,000
to the lovely lawyer...

34:01.130 --> 34:02.779
...from Wolfram and Hart.

34:06.529 --> 34:09.940
- You'll be happy with your purchase.
- We don't need the body.

34:10.730 --> 34:13.190
My employers want the eyes extracted.

34:13.730 --> 34:16.329
An extraction is a very
delicate process.

34:16.730 --> 34:19.780
We run the risk of damaging the gift.

34:20.329 --> 34:24.119
- It'll cost you an extra thousand.
- Extraction is always included.

34:25.130 --> 34:26.880
- Not seers.
- I never heard of that.

34:27.530 --> 34:30.199
There's never been something
like this on the market.

34:32.329 --> 34:34.579
An extra thousand
or you take it as is.

34:40.130 --> 34:41.670
- Go ahead.
- Alrighty, then.

34:42.530 --> 34:44.389
Hank, give me the extractor.

34:46.130 --> 34:49.010
But.... I want to do it.
You know that!

34:49.730 --> 34:52.360
- I've been begging--
- Hank, you're embarrassing yourself.

34:53.329 --> 34:54.590
Hand it over.

35:03.809 --> 35:05.840
- Convention halls?
- Downstairs.

35:11.610 --> 35:13.750
- Where's the auction?
- We have no auction.

35:14.610 --> 35:15.550
Where is it?

35:15.809 --> 35:17.769
It's in the Tulip Room.
That way.

35:26.610 --> 35:30.510
Be a good girl and hold still.
This will only hurt a lot.

35:35.010 --> 35:36.519
The sculpture's not here.

35:37.409 --> 35:39.340
As usual, one step behind.

35:41.010 --> 35:42.730
Hey, have you got a number?

35:47.610 --> 35:49.119
Hank, stakes.

36:00.210 --> 36:01.329
Get Cordelia!

36:03.210 --> 36:04.579
You all right?

36:06.210 --> 36:07.579
I'm so far not.

36:08.010 --> 36:09.380
Right, wrists.

36:11.010 --> 36:12.090
Wesley, come on!

36:29.010 --> 36:30.480
Okay, let's get out of here!

36:31.409 --> 36:32.110
Follow me!

36:36.809 --> 36:37.789
You!

36:38.610 --> 36:40.329
Butcher an innocent girl, huh?

36:40.409 --> 36:42.619
I'll thrash you within an inch
of your life.

36:43.409 --> 36:44.599
Then I'll take that inch!

36:45.210 --> 36:47.380
Our merchandise was
taken off the market.

36:48.210 --> 36:49.750
Three guesses by whom.

37:01.409 --> 37:03.199
Feel this, feeling-creepo!

37:32.610 --> 37:34.750
I never doubted for a minute
you'd find me.

37:38.010 --> 37:41.269
I was lucky. I had a rogue
demon hunter on my side.

37:44.610 --> 37:46.329
Glad I could be of service.

37:48.289 --> 37:51.619
Not that he didn't have it coming.
He was a horrible, evil monster.

37:52.489 --> 37:55.539
- He did kill a lot of people.
- Mutilated their corpses.

37:56.090 --> 37:58.900
Plus, he started the bidding on me
at a paltry $2000.

38:02.090 --> 38:04.480
This I framed for saving my life...

38:06.289 --> 38:10.500
...and as a reminder that something
of Doyle's is here in our office.

38:15.289 --> 38:17.079
Well, I'll be off then.

38:17.690 --> 38:20.849
Farewell, Angel. Who knows
when our paths will cross again.

38:21.289 --> 38:22.409
Wesley.

38:23.690 --> 38:27.449
- Do you know where you're headed?
- Rogue demon hunters rarely do.

38:27.889 --> 38:31.750
Wherever evil lurks, wherever
the dark forces threaten humanity...

38:32.690 --> 38:35.429
- ...that's where I'll be.
- Oh, okay.

38:36.289 --> 38:37.130
Keep in touch.

38:38.090 --> 38:38.960
Yes.

38:39.889 --> 38:40.969
Yes, I will.

38:41.690 --> 38:45.130
But now, the evil lurking
everywhere bids me onwards.

38:47.690 --> 38:50.360
So, I go.

38:53.090 --> 38:55.789
- Take care!
- Yes.

39:00.289 --> 39:02.150
No rest for the wicked fighters.

39:03.289 --> 39:06.519
Through storm and rain, heat...

39:06.889 --> 39:08.079
...famine...

39:08.690 --> 39:11.460
...deep, painful, gnawing hunger...

39:13.489 --> 39:15.239
- ...I go.
- Breakfast?

39:15.889 --> 39:16.760
Ooh!

39:19.489 --> 39:20.750
I suppose so.

39:21.289 --> 39:25.639
One of the perks of the job: After
a night of fighting evil, we get eggs.

39:27.289 --> 39:28.159
- Toast?
- Please.

39:28.489 --> 39:31.719
I'm famished. He's a good cook,
for someone on a liquid diet.

39:32.690 --> 39:34.059
Astonishing, really.

39:35.690 --> 39:37.550
Did you say something about toast?

39:38.305 --> 39:44.931
