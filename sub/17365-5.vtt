WEBVTT

00:11.720 --> 00:15.325
Tonight, I get scared half to death
on our track,

00:15.360 --> 00:21.480
We host our own art exhibition and the world
champion is in our reasonably priced car,

00:27.855 --> 00:30.085
Thank you, everybody!

00:30.120 --> 00:34.000
Thank you, Hello! Hello and welcome,

00:34.035 --> 00:35.605
Welcome, everybody,

00:35.640 --> 00:42.140
Now, a few years ago, we got very
excited by this, the Noble M400,

00:42.175 --> 00:48.605
But then the man behind the company
that made it upped sticks and left

00:48.640 --> 00:54.080
and then they stopped making it and then the
whole operation just disappeared from the radar,

00:54.115 --> 00:57.560
Now though... it's back,

00:59.400 --> 01:02.520
This is what it's come up with,

01:04.080 --> 01:09.920
Designed and built by some blokes I've never
heard of on an industrial estate in Leicester,

01:09.955 --> 01:12.800
it's called the M600,

01:16.240 --> 01:19.605
Underneath
the rather featureless body,

01:19.640 --> 01:23.200
the chassis is made not from
carbon fibre, but stainless steel,

01:23.235 --> 01:28.960
The V8 that powers it
is lifted from this,

01:31.600 --> 01:34.285
Yep, It uses the same engine,

01:34.320 --> 01:39.800
albeit with a couple of turbo
chargers that Volvo use in the XC90,

01:42.360 --> 01:46.360
So, built in Leicestershire from
bits of the Industrial Revolution

01:46.395 --> 01:50.280
and powered by the engine
from a Volvo school bus,

01:52.560 --> 01:55.640
And the cost? 200,000,

01:58.360 --> 02:03.120
That does seem like a lot for a car
that has no satellite navigation,

02:03.155 --> 02:06.445
no climate control, no airbag,

02:06.480 --> 02:09.000
It doesn't even have
anti-lock brakes,

02:11.000 --> 02:14.245
The men from Leicestershire
say ABS is just another example

02:14.280 --> 02:18.920
of the nanny state sticking its
nose in, and that's very admirable,

02:18.955 --> 02:23.525
But you can't help suspecting
the real reason it doesn't have ABS

02:23.560 --> 02:27.040
is because when you're operating out
of a industrial unit in Leicestershire,

02:27.075 --> 02:28.880
you can't really afford them,

02:31.120 --> 02:33.725
There's another problem as well,

02:33.760 --> 02:37.680
What kind of person looks at
the established range of supercars

02:37.715 --> 02:41.040
and thinks,
I don't like any of them?

02:43.160 --> 02:49.880
However, it turns out that there is
a reason why you might choose a Noble,

02:49.915 --> 02:54.400
rather than a Porsche, or a Ferrari

02:54.435 --> 02:56.237
or a Lamborghini,

02:56.272 --> 02:58.216
or an Aston Martin,

02:58.251 --> 03:00.160
or a McLaren Mercedes,

03:02.040 --> 03:07.560
You see, in terms of sheer speed,
the Noble can blow all of that lot

03:07.595 --> 03:10.240
into the middle of last week,

03:12.000 --> 03:18.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

03:19.880 --> 03:23.325
Let me show you
what I'm on about here,

03:23.360 --> 03:27.400
I'm currently doing 40 mph
in second gear, Ready? Foot down,

03:29.120 --> 03:30.885
And there's 60,

03:30.920 --> 03:34.800
40-60 in one second, One!

03:38.040 --> 03:41.880
In fourth gear,
100 to 120 in two seconds,

03:41.915 --> 03:46.365
100 to 130 in three seconds,

03:46.400 --> 03:54.000
It does 150 to 170 so quick that your
eyeballs bounce off the back of your skull...

03:54.035 --> 03:55.880
like squash balls!

04:00.640 --> 04:02.685
Break it, break it! Oh, my God!

04:02.720 --> 04:07.780
You have to push, There's very
little servo assistance there,

04:07.815 --> 04:12.840
If you push too hard, you'll lock
them up because there's no ABS,

04:12.875 --> 04:13.920
God, it's quick!

04:18.279 --> 04:19.880
That's mind-blowingly fast,

04:19.915 --> 04:21.485
That is properly,

04:21.519 --> 04:24.480
head-alteringly quick,

04:29.080 --> 04:33.845
Flat out,
it'll do 225 miles an hour,

04:33.880 --> 04:37.760
Mainly because the engine,
despite the Volvo connection,

04:37.795 --> 04:41.605
develops 650 horsepower,

04:41.640 --> 04:45.520
The whole car only weighs 1,250kg,

04:45.555 --> 04:49.400
And the news
keeps on getting better,

04:51.720 --> 04:54.605
This down here
is exactly the same switch

04:54.640 --> 04:59.165
that a pilot uses in a Tornado
fighter-bomber to fire the missiles,

04:59.200 --> 05:05.600
It was specifically designed so it couldn't
be used by accident and that is a good thing,

05:05.635 --> 05:08.757
Because in here, what it does

05:08.792 --> 05:11.880
is turn the traction control off,

05:16.600 --> 05:18.840
Argh! I wish I'd kept it on!

05:21.480 --> 05:23.400
I really wish I'd kept it on!

05:27.640 --> 05:29.845
The margin for error

05:29.880 --> 05:37.080
in most supercars is actually quite
wide, but in this, it really isn't,

05:37.115 --> 05:39.005
Stop,

05:39.040 --> 05:41.805
It's a constant nightmare,

05:41.840 --> 05:47.280
1% too much speed going into a
corner, you get understeer like that,

05:47.315 --> 05:51.440
1% too much throttle to
correct it, you've got oversteer,

05:51.475 --> 05:54.640
1% wrong with the steering,
you're going to spin,

05:55.840 --> 05:59.120
Remember, there are no electronic
driver aids to help you out,

05:59.155 --> 06:02.485
There's no medevac chopper,

06:02.520 --> 06:04.680
You get it wrong,
you're on your own!

06:16.520 --> 06:22.285
There is a fantastic
sweet spot in this thing,

06:22.320 --> 06:27.880
But even when you find it, you're
often too terrified to enjoy the moment,

06:27.915 --> 06:31.720
To really enjoy it
and to find it regularly...

06:33.440 --> 06:35.960
...you have to be a much
better driver than I am,

06:35.995 --> 06:38.600
I'm not really doing this justice,

06:42.920 --> 06:46.600
Driving it fast, then,
you need to be good,

06:46.635 --> 06:50.280
But weirdly, to drive it at all,
you don't,

06:51.960 --> 06:57.240
Happily, if you wind the engine down
to 550 horsepower or 450,

06:57.275 --> 07:00.045
which you can do using
this switch here,

07:00.080 --> 07:03.800
it becomes a different animal,
It becomes completely docile,

07:03.835 --> 07:08.840
Calm, No harder to drive
than... a Nissan Micra,

07:12.560 --> 07:16.080
And like the old Noble, it's
quiet and extremely comfortable,

07:16.115 --> 07:20.245
It really does ride beautifully,

07:20.280 --> 07:24.300
Summing this car up, then, is hard,
because let's be honest,

07:24.335 --> 07:28.320
there are several very good reasons
why you shouldn't buy one,

07:35.520 --> 07:40.160
But there is one
very good reason why you should...

07:43.840 --> 07:46.200
Losers!

07:53.160 --> 07:55.845
APPLAUSE

07:55.880 --> 07:59.285
So it's that fast? That edgy?
That edgy?

07:59.320 --> 08:03.980
Honestly, it's the nearest I've ever come
to collecting a camera car on a shoot,

08:04.015 --> 08:08.640
I think that was the first time I've ever
seen you properly scared on our track,

08:08.675 --> 08:10.365
Oh, I was, No, I really was,

08:10.400 --> 08:16.120
It's not so bad when it's dry, but when it's
wet you have to have the reactions of a housefly,

08:16.155 --> 08:20.997
So not a fat, balding middle-aged man,
then? Exactly,

08:21.032 --> 08:25.840
Not that, which is why we're now going
to hand it over to our tame racing driver,

08:25.875 --> 08:29.245
Some say that you shouldn't
go round to his house

08:29.280 --> 08:34.000
for your Christmas lunch, unless you
enjoy the great taste of seagull,

08:35.840 --> 08:38.405
And that the reason
he always wears a helmet

08:38.440 --> 08:43.320
is because a man once smashed him in the
face with a model of Salisbury Cathedral,

08:44.840 --> 08:47.205
All we know is
he's called the Stig!

08:47.240 --> 08:52.520
And he's off! We've had rain for the past
few weeks now and we've got a dusting of snow,

08:52.555 --> 08:55.760
Still hoping for good things,
since Stig is one of the few things

08:55.795 --> 08:59.760
that can really get to the
bottom of a Noble, He loves them!

08:59.795 --> 09:04.200
That is nice through there,
Beautiful on the way out,

09:04.235 --> 09:08.965
# In the bleak midwinter... #

09:09.000 --> 09:11.445
Appropriate music for this weather,

09:11.480 --> 09:14.685
Performing in the style of
a Kray brother's funeral there,

09:14.720 --> 09:19.280
A bit of twitchiness on the way in, but tasty
on the way out of Chicago, now Hammerhead,

09:19.315 --> 09:22.477
He came in very fast, understeering
as I discovered earlier,

09:22.512 --> 09:25.640
but Stiggy knows how to drive
through and find that sweet spot,

09:25.675 --> 09:29.080
# Oh, God
Oh, my king... #

09:32.680 --> 09:36.480
Right, time now to unleash the
twin-turbo kick in the kidneys,

09:36.515 --> 09:39.417
He does seem to be sawing
at the wheel a lot in there,

09:39.452 --> 09:42.246
It is a brute, this car,
but the Stig isn't fazed,

09:42.281 --> 09:45.005
That would be literally impossible,
Two corners left,

09:45.040 --> 09:48.800
He's still working hard, but the
car itself looks really composed,

09:48.835 --> 09:50.685
Coming up to Gambon,

09:50.720 --> 09:53.120
slices through there
and across the line!

09:53.155 --> 09:55.280
APPLAUSE

09:59.800 --> 10:02.520
OK, Here it is! Here it is,

10:02.555 --> 10:05.325
It goes, mmm...

10:05.360 --> 10:07.800
Hang on,
you've just gone above a 599,

10:07.835 --> 10:09.325
Yes, And above a Scuderia,

10:09.360 --> 10:11.840
That's that fast Lambo, 
And above the Enzo,

10:11.875 --> 10:13.685
That's an Enzo up there!

10:13.720 --> 10:15.900
Past the Veyron,
Past the Zonda convertible...

10:15.935 --> 10:18.080
Whoa! 
To there!

10:20.120 --> 10:22.200
So it's expensive, but it works?

10:24.920 --> 10:28.365
Excellent, Right,

10:28.400 --> 10:31.800
Now we will do the news
and we begin with the this -

10:31.835 --> 10:35.557
it's a new Aston Martin,
It's called the Rapide,

10:35.592 --> 10:39.245
You can think of it as a DB9
with two extra doors,

10:39.280 --> 10:45.160
That means there's room back here
for two extra fully-grown adults

10:45.195 --> 10:50.125
to enjoy the 470 horsepower,
V12 motoring experience,

10:50.160 --> 10:55.560
And they can enjoy exquisite details, such as
these magnetically located grab handles, look,

10:55.595 --> 10:58.440
It won't flap around
when you're driving along,

10:58.475 --> 11:02.497
All this is yours for 140,000,

11:02.532 --> 11:06.006
Now,
that is quite a bit more expensive

11:06.041 --> 11:09.445
than Porsche's four-door,
the Panamera,

11:09.480 --> 11:13.520
but there are two very good reasons
why you should choose the Aston Martin,

11:13.555 --> 11:18.577
Firstly, and unlike the Porsche,
it does look rather magnificent,

11:18.612 --> 11:23.600
Secondly, most importantly,
this is quintessentially British,

11:23.635 --> 11:26.480
Despite the fact
that it's made in Austria,

11:28.160 --> 11:30.925
Which I think is in Germany,

11:30.960 --> 11:35.165
OK, Now, as you can see,
we are surrounded here

11:35.200 --> 11:38.165
by a mountain of motoring-related
Christmas present ideas,

11:38.200 --> 11:42.160
I say present ideas,
actually it's landfill, Oh, yes,

11:42.195 --> 11:46.000
We haven't got time to get through all
of it, but I want to start with this,

11:46.035 --> 11:50.400
Perfume, as we know,
is a very popular Christmas gift,

11:50.435 --> 11:54.760
Big names, Givenchy, Chanel,
Now look... The RAC,

11:56.520 --> 11:58.540
Yes, the RAC has launched this,

11:58.575 --> 12:00.560
They're calling it Eau De Voiture,

12:00.595 --> 12:02.125
Ooh, sounds promising!

12:02.160 --> 12:04.600
What you do is
you spray it into your car

12:04.635 --> 12:07.005
and it makes it smell
like a minicab,

12:07.040 --> 12:10.805
It's quite strong! 
Have some of that,

12:10.840 --> 12:14.080
It is like a minicab,
Because it smells... Oh, shit!

12:15.560 --> 12:18.485
My eyes!

12:18.520 --> 12:21.760
You cretin!
I'm blind!

12:22.960 --> 12:26.445
The thing is, what it does,
and I've really got a lot of it now,

12:26.480 --> 12:31.120
is it's one of those smells that makes
you think it's covering up other smells,

12:31.155 --> 12:32.200
Like Femme Fresh,

12:32.235 --> 12:34.485
LAUGHTER

12:34.520 --> 12:40.320
Because it's a very strong smell in it's own right,
but it suggests that there are other things masking,

12:40.355 --> 12:45.040
You get notes, don't you? You get
notes, undercurrents, Suggestions of...

12:45.075 --> 12:48.160
I can smell the fruity stuff,
but also a bit of stale wee,

12:48.195 --> 12:49.805
Sick?

12:49.840 --> 12:52.365
I can get a really beery burp,

12:52.400 --> 12:54.525
All the things
you'd expect in a minicab,

12:54.560 --> 12:58.005
I have another gift suggestion here
for Christmas,

12:58.040 --> 13:01.525
Are you fed up with people bumping
into you in a crowd situation?

13:01.560 --> 13:04.280
Yes, I am!
Well, I have the solution here

13:04.315 --> 13:09.077
with these small, ear-mounted
human indicators, I kid you not,

13:09.112 --> 13:13.840
What happens is, I'm walking along,
say in a shopping centre,

13:13.875 --> 13:16.725
Here I am in a shopping centre
and you'll be the crowd?

13:16.760 --> 13:20.480
There's a danger of jostling here,
because I'm going to that shop on my right,

13:20.515 --> 13:22.405
You can indicate!

13:22.440 --> 13:25.200
So now you know and you can take evasive action,
And you can go left?

13:25.235 --> 13:29.160
Yes, Actually,
I fancy the record shop over there,

13:30.680 --> 13:34.720
Everybody knows what's happening, I think it's a very
good gift, Human indicators,

13:34.755 --> 13:36.817
So how much are they? Do we know?

13:36.852 --> 13:38.845
Oh, I don't know, Some money,

13:38.880 --> 13:41.645
Land Rover are taking
a very pragmatic approach

13:41.680 --> 13:44.445
to the Christmas gift idea
and they have produced this,

13:44.480 --> 13:49.520
It's the Land Rover distress
whistle and it will cost you 1,50,

13:49.555 --> 13:52.805
I just want to paint the scene
for you, You're in the wilderness

13:52.840 --> 13:58.280
in your Land Rover and you drive into
an impassable gully, You become stuck,

13:58.315 --> 14:00.165
It starts to fill up with water,

14:00.200 --> 14:02.480
You're out of food,
you're almost out of fuel,

14:02.515 --> 14:04.725
You cannot get a signal
on your mobile phone

14:04.760 --> 14:08.480
and you're bleeding heavily from a
severe abdominal wound, But it's OK!

14:08.515 --> 14:10.325
HE BLOWS WHISTLE

14:10.360 --> 14:13.900
If I was there with you in that
situation and you produced that whistle,

14:13.935 --> 14:17.467
I would beat you to death, 
That's nice,

14:17.502 --> 14:21.000
Well, yes,
Look at this superb shirt,

14:21.035 --> 14:24.680
It's got everything
you need, really,

14:24.715 --> 14:27.525
It has a web address here,

14:27.560 --> 14:30.405
It's stitched into the collar
and then on the back,

14:30.440 --> 14:33.245
look at that
- Mercedes-Benz, That's classy,

14:33.280 --> 14:38.600
Oh, yeah, Really, honestly, it's hard to
think of any way that this could be improved,

14:38.635 --> 14:42.800
That says, I have a washing machine and
everything else I own is already in it,

14:42.835 --> 14:46.280
But, James, you like a flowery
shirt, so why wouldn't you like that?

14:46.315 --> 14:49.240
Well, why would you want
a web address?

14:49.275 --> 14:52.245
Jeremy? Jeremy?

14:52.280 --> 14:54.845
OK, this is a bad thing,
That's a bad thing,

14:54.880 --> 14:58.440
It's got out of hand,
It's all right, No, it's gone out,

14:58.475 --> 15:00.645
Relax,

15:00.680 --> 15:02.085
That's actually quite...

15:02.120 --> 15:05.205
Jeremy has
set fire to the Christmas presents!

15:05.240 --> 15:09.120
I have actually set fire to
the Land Rover teddy bear, No,

15:12.680 --> 15:14.760
You know
the smoking rules in Britain?

15:20.040 --> 15:22.480
My eyes! Sorry about that!

15:22.515 --> 15:24.165
Anyway, look - I think...

15:24.200 --> 15:27.040
It's still on fire! 
It's not,

15:27.075 --> 15:29.320
It's smouldering, that's all,

15:29.355 --> 15:32.085
Look at this!

15:32.120 --> 15:36.000
It's a fork on one end and
a 10mm ring spanner on the other,

15:36.035 --> 15:39.880
And the best thing is, there's
another spanner in the middle!

15:39.915 --> 15:42.725
No, but this means
you can go seamlessly

15:42.760 --> 15:46.640
from mending your motorcycle to
eating a pie without even pausing,

15:46.675 --> 15:49.480
Look at this, 

15:49.515 --> 15:51.765
You say wow,

15:51.800 --> 15:53.445
This is some packaging,

15:53.480 --> 15:57.840
You know the sort of packaging? You're
going to sever your fingers getting in there,

15:57.875 --> 16:00.525
When you get in there,
you've got this metal thing,

16:00.560 --> 16:04.140
Then you get underneath your car,
use what fingers you have left

16:04.175 --> 16:07.720
from opening the packaging
to attach it to your exhaust pipe,

16:07.755 --> 16:11.920
And then it makes a noise
which fools other road users

16:11.955 --> 16:14.760
into thinking
that your car is turbo-charged,

16:17.000 --> 16:19.040
Is it like that wastegate
noise when you lift off?

16:19.075 --> 16:21.565
Brilliant,

16:21.600 --> 16:24.165
We could attach you -
it would be easier,

16:24.200 --> 16:29.200
It's not really going to fool anybody bolted
onto my Panda, whatever sort of noise it makes,

16:29.235 --> 16:32.845
Chaps, you know how difficult
it is to choose the right calendar,

16:32.880 --> 16:37.080
Obviously you choose it now and
you've got to live with it, It's a big commitment,

16:37.115 --> 16:39.125
For 12 months,
you have to live with it,

16:39.160 --> 16:43.240
So I'm a bit stumped on what I'm going to
use next year, because there's this one,

16:43.275 --> 16:47.760
This is Her Majesty's
Prisons of England,

16:47.795 --> 16:51.485
Different picture every month,

16:51.520 --> 16:57.200
But then I found this one
- Birmingham's Outer Circle Municipal Bus Route, nice!

16:57.235 --> 17:02.600
But then I found, I think, the
solution to my calendar problems,

17:02.635 --> 17:04.640
The Unofficial...

17:04.675 --> 17:06.377
Oh, yes!

17:06.412 --> 17:08.045
CHEERING

17:08.079 --> 17:10.280
Who did that? It's awful!

17:13.760 --> 17:16.160
You can have it, James,
I've got loads,

17:17.319 --> 17:20.525
Why are you
drunk in all the pictures?

17:20.560 --> 17:24.365
It looks like all the pictures were
taken coming out of award ceremonies,

17:24.400 --> 17:28.560
so, yes, I probably was drunk, 
Do you know what I really love about that calendar?

17:28.595 --> 17:33.000
Because it's unofficial, you all go and
buy one, he receives not one single penny,

17:33.035 --> 17:35.400
I know, I know!
Thank you for publicising it,

17:35.435 --> 17:38.125
It's very kind of you,

17:38.160 --> 17:42.000
We'd like to recommend this
calendar, Everybody go and buy it,

17:42.035 --> 17:43.645
Get rid of that thing!

17:43.680 --> 17:46.165
Let's do
the rest of the show like that,

17:46.200 --> 17:50.120
Why does everything get
broken in our Christmas thing?

17:50.155 --> 17:54.005
As we know, the Lottery Fund
has spent millions of pounds

17:54.040 --> 17:59.760
turning old warehouses in places like Liverpool
and the West Midlands into art galleries,

17:59.795 --> 18:03.405
And we also know that they have
all been an unmitigated failure,

18:03.440 --> 18:08.200
We think the reason for this is because
they haven't got any cars in them,

18:08.235 --> 18:13.497
Art experts will tell you that cars
aren't art, We think they can be,

18:13.532 --> 18:18.725
Back in the 1970s, BMW started
making things like this over here,

18:18.760 --> 18:24.440
It's a three-litre CSL, but the bodywork has
been painted by American artist Alexander Calder,

18:24.475 --> 18:27.205
Then in the '90s,
there was a three-series race car,

18:27.240 --> 18:31.140
The body's been painted by artist
Sandro Chia, Then over here,

18:31.175 --> 18:35.005
an 850 CSI - that's been painted
by British artist David Hockney,

18:35.040 --> 18:38.280
Provincial galleries would never
accept this sort of thing these days,

18:38.315 --> 18:41.325
and that, we reckon,
is exactly why they're failing,

18:41.360 --> 18:45.000
So we decided to take over the
Mima Gallery in Middlesbrough,

18:45.035 --> 18:47.845
And using nothing
but motoring-based art,

18:47.880 --> 18:54.040
we would attempt to get 30,000 visitors
through the door up North in a single week,

18:54.075 --> 18:58.160
And that's as many as Tate
Britain gets in a week in London,

18:59.160 --> 19:04.360
This is the North,
which is where northerners live,

19:08.400 --> 19:11.525
And this is the art gallery
we've taken over,

19:11.560 --> 19:16.480
We'd simply clear out the paintings
northern people plainly don't want to see,

19:16.515 --> 19:21.080
and fill it with motoring
exhibits that hopefully they do,

19:22.600 --> 19:30.000
To decide what these exhibits would be, we
went to our secret motoring art base in Surrey,

19:30.035 --> 19:33.360
What on earth is that? It's a car,

19:33.395 --> 19:36.365
The artist claims that he makes
these by painting them

19:36.400 --> 19:39.405
and then driving a remote control
over them, I mean, I like it,

19:39.440 --> 19:41.800
I like it, 
It's got a joie de vivre to it,

19:41.835 --> 19:44.645
Yes, put it in! Oh!

19:44.680 --> 19:47.325
It's Damon Hill in the wet,

19:47.360 --> 19:50.000
Superb, That goes in,

19:50.035 --> 19:52.605
What he should have done
is just given us that bit,

19:52.640 --> 19:58.480
That would now look like one of Monet's visions of
his lily pond, but it would be about Formula One,

19:58.515 --> 20:01.005
It does have a Monet
quality to it, no question,

20:01.040 --> 20:04.565
I'm sorry, gentlemen, this
is the worst painting I've ever seen

20:04.600 --> 20:08.240
in my entire
life and it's not coming, Or is it?

20:08.275 --> 20:12.125
Maybe this is a commentary
on the superhuman,

20:12.160 --> 20:16.280
almost alien nature of
a Formula One driver at this level,

20:16.315 --> 20:18.857
Because clearly this isn't human,

20:18.892 --> 20:21.365
That much is immediately apparent,

20:21.400 --> 20:25.920
What it's done is suck the life out
of this corpse in the overalls her,

20:25.955 --> 20:29.845
All of that is gone,
drained out by this creature,

20:29.880 --> 20:33.560
This is coming with us,
This is properly amazing stuff,

20:33.595 --> 20:37.205
And so is that, I think in
Middlesbrough this will go well,

20:37.240 --> 20:42.840
Why-aye, a tab! They're refuelling
his car and he's having a tab,

20:42.875 --> 20:47.245
That is, without doubt,
the centrepiece of our exhibition,

20:47.280 --> 20:50.320
It's exquisite work, 
That is not going in,

20:50.355 --> 20:52.640
Hammond... It cannot go in!

20:52.675 --> 20:56.445
We went round
the room ticking the yeses,

20:56.480 --> 21:00.200
Look at the way they've captured
his moustache so beautifully here,

21:00.235 --> 21:03.480
Not just that moustache, but
the other two moustaches as well,

21:03.515 --> 21:07.960
So this is a collage
out of press comments about him,

21:07.995 --> 21:09.765
I see,

21:09.800 --> 21:12.200
Excellent, Definitely going in,

21:12.235 --> 21:14.365
Oh, gentlemen!

21:14.400 --> 21:18.440
Gentlemen! I bet you any money
that in the North,

21:18.475 --> 21:22.445
people will be stunned by this,
It's a V8 Shark,

21:22.480 --> 21:26.360
If it provokes a response, that's going,
It will provoke a response,

21:27.520 --> 21:32.160
In addition to the pre-prepared art,
we've been making some ourselves,

21:32.195 --> 21:36.685
James, for example,
is keen to make a sculpture,

21:36.720 --> 21:40.940
I've decided to de-construct the car,
literally, as you can see, and artistically,

21:40.975 --> 21:45.125
Then rather than try and rebuild it as
a sculpture that speaks about the car,

21:45.160 --> 21:51.440
I'm going to do it as a sculpture that speaks
about my emotions, my feelings, when I drive a car,

21:51.475 --> 21:53.720
Inspired to some extent by Picasso...

21:55.240 --> 21:58.165
What you need to bear in mind
is if you can get an artist,

21:58.200 --> 22:02.960
somebody with frizzy hair and sticky-out
teeth, to say it's art, then it's art,

22:04.120 --> 22:08.045
While James set to work
on his big metal face,

22:08.080 --> 22:14.720
Richard went off to create a modern day
interpretation of Constable's Hay Wain,

22:15.960 --> 22:17.360
Right...

22:23.320 --> 22:28.000
Unlike Richard, I'm not very good at
drawing, because I didn't go to art school,

22:28.035 --> 22:32.160
So my painting will be done by this,

22:34.040 --> 22:39.885
The 2005 Red Bull F1 car, Yep,

22:39.920 --> 22:44.380
Its three-litre V10
will be my brush,

22:44.415 --> 22:48.805
All we need now
is a tame racing driver,

22:48.840 --> 22:52.680
Some say he has a massive chin,
and that's true, he does,

22:52.715 --> 22:56.485
Because he's David Coulthard,
So are you ready for this?

22:56.520 --> 22:59.640
I think so, I'm still trying
to get my head round the concept,

22:59.675 --> 23:01.325
Well, the idea is very simple,

23:01.360 --> 23:05.205
We are going to put
paintballs into the air box,

23:05.240 --> 23:08.520
They will then shoot out of
the exhaust, and into the canvas

23:08.555 --> 23:10.125
that I'll be holding behind the car,

23:10.160 --> 23:13.765
so we'll sort of splatter the canvas
using this car as our brush,

23:13.800 --> 23:17.960
Sounds beautiful, It's
triggered to start firing them at 5,000 RPM,

23:17.995 --> 23:20.445
So you need to go to 5,000,
Can you do that?

23:20.480 --> 23:25.400
I can probably manage that, So if you
want to hop in, mate, I'll go and stand behind the vehicle,

23:25.435 --> 23:28.880
Actually I might just put
some protection on my head,

23:30.400 --> 23:34.080
I've done some weird things
in my life, but this is up there,

23:34.115 --> 23:35.720
All right then, David, Ready!

23:43.920 --> 23:47.320
Argh! Oh, God! Oh!

23:47.355 --> 23:49.645
My gloves!

23:49.680 --> 23:53.965
I'm not giving him mouth-to-mouth,
that's for sure,

23:54.000 --> 23:58.040
Things were going badly for me, but
they were worse for Sir Henry May,

24:09.240 --> 24:14.685
Every day, over 10,000 people go to the
National Gallery to see the Hay Wain,

24:14.720 --> 24:20.040
More will come and see this, because it's
got more of a social statement about it,

24:20.075 --> 24:25.280
Also, because I'd substituted
the Hay Wain for a Zonda,

24:25.315 --> 24:27.120
It's poetry in paint,

24:30.600 --> 24:34.400
One's now protected and using
a stronger aluminium canvas,

24:34.435 --> 24:37.040
Coulthard and I were in business,

24:46.080 --> 24:50.240
A plane of light
just bouncing off here,

24:50.275 --> 24:52.000
Work it in, work it in...

24:54.680 --> 25:00.165
With the paintball painting finished,
I was now busy on another creation,

25:00.200 --> 25:07.980
What I'm doing is spraying the car with a special
paint that shows up best in ultra-violet light,

25:08.015 --> 25:15.760
Sorry, sorry! So when I've finished, Mr Coulthard
is going to take it for a spin round the track,

25:15.795 --> 25:20.120
It will streak, showing me
where the air flow has gone,

25:20.155 --> 25:23.125
Sorry, sorry again, Sorry, mate,

25:23.160 --> 25:26.840
With the car dripping wet,
David set off,

25:30.400 --> 25:34.600
But unfortunately some of the paint
had gone on his visor,

25:37.160 --> 25:38.720
Oh, dear!

25:42.280 --> 25:48.000
After wiping his helmet, he set
off again to create some 200mph art,

25:54.600 --> 25:56.885
You sprayed my helmet,

25:56.920 --> 25:58.565
You shot one of my testicles,

25:58.600 --> 26:01.680
Oh, I see, that helmet,
That was, I admit, a mistake,

26:01.715 --> 26:04.557
but you should
see what has been achieved,

26:04.592 --> 26:07.365
When we put this
under ultra-violet light...

26:07.400 --> 26:09.920
Can we edit the spin out? 
Yes, we can edit that out!

26:09.955 --> 26:11.805
You promise?

26:11.840 --> 26:15.580
Projects completed,
we reconvened at the secret base,

26:15.615 --> 26:19.320
where our exhibits
were to be assessed by Rupert Maas,

26:19.355 --> 26:21.600
an art dealer
from the Antiques Roadshow,

26:23.120 --> 26:24.725
It was a lot better than this,

26:24.760 --> 26:28.600
The problem was, it didn't
dry, It's sort of still happening, isn't it?

26:28.635 --> 26:34.400
It's performance art, because
it has streaked in a living way,

26:35.440 --> 26:37.205
Yes...

26:37.240 --> 26:39.325
It fell off the easel,

26:39.360 --> 26:44.080
I mean, it really is nature and the
automotive world absolutely crashing together,

26:44.115 --> 26:46.325
It's very good, Very good,

26:46.360 --> 26:51.600
Quite, quite, I have to say, I think it is
probably more compost than art, but thank you,

26:53.480 --> 26:58.880
Annoyingly, Rupert seemed to quite
interested in James May's big face,

26:58.915 --> 27:02.405
It's called
Acceleration Face Number One,

27:02.440 --> 27:05.845
I mean, I was inspired
to some extent by Der Blaue Reiter

27:05.880 --> 27:09.405
and some of the works of that era, 
tts:color=lime0 And African masks, Exactly,

27:09.440 --> 27:15.920
The African mask has had an influence on it, It's very
angular, it's quite simplistic, it's quite primitive,

27:15.955 --> 27:19.005
Has it been on fire? No,

27:19.040 --> 27:25.040
What does the expert think? Well, let's have
a look at it in the round, I quite like the welding, Oh!

27:29.680 --> 27:31.240
We can repair this, James,

27:32.720 --> 27:36.240
That's better! You see?

27:37.560 --> 27:40.645
The Mona Lisa of the scrapheap,

27:40.680 --> 27:44.365
The rest of the visit
wasn't any better,

27:44.400 --> 27:47.720
Is there anything
here that catches your eye? No,

27:47.755 --> 27:49.517
Does that one work? No,

27:49.552 --> 27:51.280
Is this no good? No,

27:51.315 --> 27:53.925
Does it work on any level for you?

27:53.960 --> 27:56.540
No, Does it have artistic merit?

27:56.575 --> 27:59.085
No, So all of this is terrible?

27:59.120 --> 28:02.440
Frankly, yes, Thank you
very much for coming along, Thank you,

28:02.475 --> 28:07.485
I value your opinion, I won't
necessarily pay any attention to it,

28:07.520 --> 28:11.400
In fact, none of us will, But thank you very much for
coming, Rupert, Pleasure,

28:11.435 --> 28:17.600
Feeling a bit disheartened, we decided
to try and create our own BMW art car,

28:17.635 --> 28:21.245
We need to agree on
a light source and a viewpoint,

28:21.280 --> 28:26.340
Our genius plan was to paint the
inside of the car on the outside,

28:26.375 --> 28:31.400
with James taking the bonnet,
me the side, and Jeremy the boot,

28:31.435 --> 28:33.445
Can you tell what it is yet?

28:33.480 --> 28:36.080
Jeremy, though,
didn't quite get the idea,

28:36.115 --> 28:38.760
Right, red for the blood,

28:38.795 --> 28:41.840
Er, mate...

28:41.875 --> 28:44.365
What?

28:44.400 --> 28:46.645
It's supposed to be
what's INSIDE the car,

28:46.680 --> 28:50.805
How do you know there isn't
a horse's head in the boot?

28:50.840 --> 28:57.760
For our final creation, we had to cut a car in
half, which meant using a dangerous plasma cutter,

28:57.795 --> 29:01.565
That meant
we had to take precautions,

29:01.600 --> 29:04.640
I could help,
You can't do this with a hammer,

29:04.675 --> 29:07.057
That's exactly why
you're taped to a chair,

29:07.092 --> 29:09.440
This is like a scene
out of Reservoir Dogs,

29:09.475 --> 29:12.885
Don't give us ideas,

29:12.920 --> 29:16.485
Guys, where did you find that car?

29:16.520 --> 29:19.560
It was just outside with
all the rest of them for this,

29:19.595 --> 29:24.160
It says here,
RJO4 RWZ, it's a rental car,

29:27.560 --> 29:29.880
APPLAUSE

29:32.040 --> 29:34.365
We'll see how that pans out
later on,

29:34.400 --> 29:39.005
but now it's time to put a
star in our reasonably priced car,

29:39.040 --> 29:45.680
Now, my guest tonight won the 2009
Formula One World Drivers' Championship,

29:45.715 --> 29:51.445
He won the 2009 World Constructors'
Championship for Brawn,

29:51.480 --> 29:56.120
And when he was pipped to the BBC's
Sports Personality of the Year award

29:56.155 --> 29:58.405
last weekend, by Ryan Giggs,

29:58.440 --> 30:03.440
he won the 2009 trophy
for the best forced smile,

30:04.720 --> 30:06.800
Let's see
if he's still gritting his teeth,

30:06.835 --> 30:09.720
Ladies and gentlemen, Jenson Button!

30:09.755 --> 30:11.680
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE

30:11.715 --> 30:14.317
Thank you,

30:14.352 --> 30:16.885
He's here,

30:16.920 --> 30:18.640
Hello to you, Well done,

30:20.240 --> 30:23.000
Jenson Button,
Formula One World Champion, Wooh!

30:23.035 --> 30:26.137
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE

30:26.172 --> 30:29.240
Have a seat, Have a seat,

30:30.960 --> 30:35.840
OK, that's the congratulations
over now the commiserations,

30:35.875 --> 30:38.845
Because this
time last week...

30:38.880 --> 30:41.560
Did anybody see
Sports Personality Of The Year?

30:41.595 --> 30:44.445
Yes, Yes,

30:44.480 --> 30:50.160
I mean, let's be honest, Ryan Giggs,
he's 73,

30:50.195 --> 30:51.725
And he can still kick a football,

30:51.760 --> 30:53.925
I think you do need an
award for this, actually,

30:53.960 --> 30:56.080
We have actually got a clip of the
moment, If you want to look away,

30:56.115 --> 31:01.080
Everyone else can see this,
here we go, This is the moment,

31:01.115 --> 31:03.917
Well, that is a shock,

31:03.952 --> 31:06.720
That's a big shock,

31:06.755 --> 31:08.565
Yeah,

31:08.600 --> 31:12.120
That is a... That is a rictus grin,
that is,

31:13.760 --> 31:15.920
I could be an actor with that, no?

31:15.955 --> 31:18.005
No, you couldn't,

31:18.040 --> 31:20.365
You couldn't because what I loved
was when he said

31:20.400 --> 31:23.125
I haven't got a speech ready I
thought, no, but the man behind you has,

31:23.160 --> 31:27.100
So anyway, I just want to know because I'm
sure loads of people will be interested,

31:27.135 --> 31:31.040
It was actually this time last year,
there you were gearing up for a new season,

31:31.075 --> 31:35.045
You had got Ross Brawn on board
who's obviously a genius designer

31:35.080 --> 31:40.680
and then the call comes through from Honda that
they're pulling out of the sport, How did that feel?

31:40.715 --> 31:45.160
It was difficult, I had just got back from, I
was in Lanzarote doing some fitness training,

31:45.195 --> 31:47.525
I was all ready for the new season,

31:47.560 --> 31:51.320
I arrived at Gatwick and I got a
message from my manager saying,

31:51.355 --> 31:52.805
it's over,

31:52.840 --> 31:54.445
Honda are pulling out of the sport,

31:54.480 --> 31:58.805
It was a really difficult thing
to take in, Because you know, will

31:58.840 --> 32:04.400
were going to be racing in 2009, We were going to
have a competitive car, possibility of winning races,

32:04.435 --> 32:06.605
There was a lot of work
that went into that car and

32:06.640 --> 32:09.605
it would have been an absolute
tragedy if it wasn't on the grid,

32:09.640 --> 32:14.320
So all I could do was stay focused and
try to help the team as much as I could,

32:14.355 --> 32:18.965
And that's what we did, we got through a
difficult winter and we produced a car...

32:19.000 --> 32:22.880
And this was when Ross was able to buy what
remained of the Honda team,  Yes,

32:22.915 --> 32:30.925
Now, you came here last time having not won a
race in Formula One and you had done about 14011,

32:30.960 --> 32:37.680
 Yeah, And you said you'd cheerfully
give up the jets, the lifestyle, the Monte Carlo for that first win,

32:37.715 --> 32:43.240
But the thing is you damn nearly did give up
all that lifestyle to go to Brawn, didn't you?

32:43.275 --> 32:48.005
I mean how big a sort of cut
was it in terms of everything?

32:48.040 --> 32:53.845
There were 700 odd people working at the
factory and they had to scale down the team

32:53.880 --> 32:58.560
so obviously there were some redundancies,
which was tough, even for the people that stayed,

32:58.595 --> 33:03.880
But we all gave as much as we could
and we tried to help as much as we can,

33:03.915 --> 33:06.760
I suppose it would be impossible to
say, no, I want n million dollars

33:06.795 --> 33:08.605
a year when people are
being made redundant,

33:08.640 --> 33:10.760
Because you went to 20% of
your salary or something,

33:10.795 --> 33:15.080
Can't remember the figure
at the moment,

33:15.115 --> 33:16.720
But don't feel sorry for me,

33:16.755 --> 33:18.365
LAUGHTER

33:18.400 --> 33:20.845
But that first test that you did

33:20.880 --> 33:27.280
in what would become the Brawn car,
were you surprised how fast it was?

33:27.315 --> 33:31.445
I knew we had built a good
car because all the numbers

33:31.480 --> 33:35.525
said so in the wind tunnel but until you
actually drive it, yeah, you don't know 100%,

33:35.560 --> 33:40.520
But we bolted in the Mercedes Benz engine in the
back because obviously it wasn't made for that engine,

33:40.555 --> 33:46.920
We had to sort of trim the chassis down and
make sure the gearbox fitted, just about fitted,

33:46.955 --> 33:49.085
With some spaces and what have you,

33:49.120 --> 33:54.360
And went out and tested it at Barcelona and after
five laps I really felt comfortable in the car,

33:54.395 --> 33:57.880
And I came and I said, Guys, you know,
this is all right, This is a good baseline,

33:57.915 --> 34:00.357
Even though it was a last minute
botch job to get the Mercedes engine,

34:00.392 --> 34:02.765
Yes, yep, this fills pretty nice,
My engineer came up to me and said,

34:02.800 --> 34:07.360
 Jenson, you are seven tenths quicker
than anyone, They had been testing for three months, 

34:07.395 --> 34:12.920
Seven-tenths,  Seven tenths, Which
is a lot, That's three years in Formula One,

34:12.955 --> 34:16.040
It's massive, Oh yeah,
And then every race people were putting on

34:16.074 --> 34:19.880
big packages and for us to try and
keep the advantage was impossible,

34:19.915 --> 34:22.445
So, yeah, it's been a
very tricky season,

34:22.480 --> 34:25.080
Leading the championship from
start to finish sounds easy,

34:25.114 --> 34:26.725
But it's not,

34:26.760 --> 34:29.005
It's really, really hard,

34:29.040 --> 34:31.324
Cos I have to say,
I mean Brazil, I don't know

34:31.360 --> 34:34.679
if anybody was watching Brazil
which was the penultimate race,

34:34.715 --> 34:37.077
You had to come fourth and
then you were definitely

34:37.112 --> 34:39.405
World Champion irrespective
of what anyone else did,

34:39.440 --> 34:45.440
Let's just have a look at these clips of
you in that race needing to come fourth,

34:45.475 --> 34:48.085
So that's big John, isn't it?

34:48.120 --> 34:50.480
Grosjean? Grosjean, Yeah,

34:50.514 --> 34:52.925
'Can he do it?'

34:52.960 --> 34:56.400
'Another stunning piece of driving under pressure from
Button,'  Thank you, Martin,

34:56.435 --> 34:59.037
Look at that
again, that's round the outside,

34:59.072 --> 35:01.605
'Wonderful move by
Button squeezed in there,'

35:01.640 --> 35:05.080
We're almost doing 200 miles an hour there you can't really see
it from the camera but it's ... 

35:05.115 --> 35:07.237
Jesus that's so close,

35:07.272 --> 35:09.325
'Jenson Button through,'

35:09.360 --> 35:11.885
'I have to say,
he's been impressive,'

35:11.920 --> 35:15.805
So this is now whatever
his name is, the Red Bull,

35:15.840 --> 35:19.480
That was last of the late
breakers, wasn't it? Take that,

35:22.160 --> 35:23.365
APPLAUSE

35:23.400 --> 35:28.600
Great drive,  Thank you,
That was the drive of a champion that was,

35:28.635 --> 35:30.640
You know when it kicks out...

35:30.880 --> 35:35.685
When I'm driving a car and it
kicks out like that, I poo myself,

35:35.720 --> 35:39.725
This might sound really silly and
think I'm a bit of a know it all, but

35:39.760 --> 35:44.460
 I did actually do that on
purpose a little bit, What, kick the tail out?

35:44.495 --> 35:49.160
Because I had to make sure that I could get to turn
two first and one of the only way of doing it is

35:49.195 --> 35:51.600
a little bit of oversteer makes the guy a
little nervous that you're getting close,

35:51.635 --> 35:55.725
And that is what happened, And the
great thing is he backed out of it,

35:55.760 --> 36:03.720
Sorry, I just need to... This is very peculiar,
So you have the World Championship riding on

36:03.755 --> 36:06.240
your having to finish the race,
obviously to get the World Championship,

36:06.275 --> 36:10.360
And you kick the arse of the car
out, ON PURPOSE,

36:10.395 --> 36:13.165
to unnerve whoever he is,

36:13.200 --> 36:17.120
Well, it's giving him less room he's
got no room to turn on the inside,

36:17.155 --> 36:20.805
Yes but what if you had
cocked it up,

36:20.840 --> 36:25.800
You know for me to win the world championship before the
last race was a must, Oh, yeah,

36:25.835 --> 36:29.520
I really wanted to get it done
before so I had to take the risk,

36:29.555 --> 36:32.800
Now, obviously we are
looking forward to you versus Lewis,

36:32.835 --> 36:34.765
Are you going to
be able to beat him?

36:34.800 --> 36:36.685
That's the aim, I
wouldn't be doing it if not,

36:36.720 --> 36:38.840
That's going to be, I tell you it's
going to be a fascinating battle,

36:38.875 --> 36:42.525
This is a massive buzz for me,
It's so exciting,

36:42.560 --> 36:46.965
I've been in F1 for ten years and
having the chance to race

36:47.000 --> 36:51.160
alongside Lewis at McLaren, it's
something I'm really excited about,

36:51.195 --> 36:53.045
Can we just talk
about your road cars?

36:53.080 --> 37:00.600
 Yes, Have you not got a Veyron? 
Yes, I have, Can I just ask what's the fastest you've driven it?

37:00.635 --> 37:05.560
Um, 70 times... Less 10%... 77,

37:05.595 --> 37:08.640
LAUGHTER

37:11.080 --> 37:13.085
LAUGHTER

37:13.120 --> 37:14.765
 It's actually been here, 
 Do you believe him? Has it?

37:14.800 --> 37:18.520
I sneaked in one day and unlocked the bars and drove round your
circuit, Had a bit of a practice,

37:18.555 --> 37:20.645
Was it any good here?

37:20.680 --> 37:27.840
It was all right, except for you had... I can't say
what I was going to say, Because I want to sell it,

37:27.875 --> 37:30.525
LAUGHTER

37:30.560 --> 37:34.240
So anyway, obviously you came here
into our Liana,

37:34.275 --> 37:36.165
I tell you what,

37:36.200 --> 37:38.160
I had to change my driving style here,
Really?

37:38.195 --> 37:41.477
I think it was the snow, possibly,

37:41.512 --> 37:44.725
You say that, you're such a fusspot,

37:44.760 --> 37:48.720
No, seriously, listen to this, You've
got to listen to me, I'm a guest,

37:48.755 --> 37:51.205
LAUGHTER

37:51.240 --> 37:53.920
Go on because it would just
be a racing driver excuse,

37:53.955 --> 37:56.165
No, it isn't an excuse
but I jumped in

37:56.200 --> 38:00.240
and I sat there revving the engine with
the heater on thinking, I'm so nervous,

38:00.275 --> 38:03.525
This thing is an amazing bit of
kit,

38:03.560 --> 38:07.600
I've learnt so much coming here I'm really
going to take it into the 2010 season,

38:09.800 --> 38:12.605
Who would like to see Jenson's lap?

38:12.640 --> 38:14.205
Yeah!

38:14.240 --> 38:16.440
There you go, It's
obviously the old Liana,

38:17.960 --> 38:20.285
And there it is,
We haven't seen that for ages,

38:20.320 --> 38:23.100
Look how wet it is, It's damp,

38:23.135 --> 38:25.987
Think like this is for the
World Championship, come on JB,

38:26.022 --> 38:28.840
It's more important than the
Formula One world championship,

38:28.875 --> 38:30.445
Look at it, it's greasy,

38:30.480 --> 38:35.405
In F1 if it's wet the tyres work,
if it's greasy you just slide,

38:35.440 --> 38:40.240
You're holding on nicely through there,
 A little bit slippery out here,

38:40.275 --> 38:42.685
It is interesting, that first turn,

38:42.720 --> 38:45.565
Yes, I'm
impressed, no power understeer,

38:45.600 --> 38:50.480
First turn you took the
wide line in, A little bit wild, JB, Come on!

38:50.515 --> 38:51.725
At least I'm not singing,

38:51.760 --> 38:56.960
You're not singing, And Lewis has a different line
in that first corner and he's adamant about it,

38:56.995 --> 39:01.777
So there you
go, you see, now that's tidy, 

39:01.812 --> 39:06.560
I tell you what, I'm more scared
driving this than I'm a Formula One car,

39:06.595 --> 39:08.845
I was, This bit here is scary,

39:08.880 --> 39:13.680
It is, If you go on the red wires, that's
quite slippery, I think they should put this on the F1 calendar,

39:13.715 --> 39:15.240
This place rocks,

39:16.760 --> 39:18.360
Oh, That was nice and close
to the tyres made the move,

39:18.395 --> 39:21.320
Second to last corner
here let's have a look,

39:21.355 --> 39:22.885
Yes, that's good,

39:22.920 --> 39:26.160
Got the back out a bit,
 Yeah, it's fun, Beauty,

39:26.195 --> 39:27.840
Come-on, got the back out again,

39:27.875 --> 39:29.557
There we are,

39:29.592 --> 39:31.205
Across the line,

39:31.240 --> 39:32.960
I thought that looked
quite good, that,

39:32.995 --> 39:34.445
So,

39:34.480 --> 39:36.960
APPLAUSE

39:40.800 --> 39:43.840
So, Here we go, Jenson... Button,

39:47.440 --> 39:49.800
 See that, I didn't
even lean forward, You will,

39:51.520 --> 39:53.640
No, really, Where do you reckon?

39:53.675 --> 39:55.245
It felt good,

39:55.280 --> 39:57.940
Very slippery but I could slide
the car through the corners,

39:57.975 --> 40:00.600
It was fun, I don't think
I'm quicker than I was before,

40:00.635 --> 40:04.445
Because it was dry, how would I be?

40:04.480 --> 40:08.965
Well, Lewis was here in exactly the
same car in exactly the same conditions,

40:09.000 --> 40:12.720
They rarely were exactly
the same, I'm a better driver than I was then,

40:12.755 --> 40:18.400
You did it, he's a 1,44,7,
you did it in 1...

40:18.435 --> 40:20.497
40...

40:20.532 --> 40:22.560
4...

40:24.560 --> 40:26.045
9...

40:26.080 --> 40:28.640
 Oh, you're kidding, 
 You just missed out,

40:28.675 --> 40:30.885
But give him a huge one,

40:30.920 --> 40:33.160
Wait a minute, I'll
give you the wet,

40:35.120 --> 40:37.360
Look at that,

40:38.920 --> 40:42.120
Do you know what it was? It was that
showboating in the last two corners,

40:42.155 --> 40:44.685
It was fun, though,
That little thing is so fun,

40:44.720 --> 40:48.800
It is, You should try the
more powerful Chevrolet Lacetti,

40:48.835 --> 40:50.360
Well, they wouldn't let
me have a go in that one,

40:50.395 --> 40:51.885
No, because that's the Formula One
car,

40:51.920 --> 40:58.240
Anyway ladies and gentlemen, I give
our World Champion, Jenson Button,

40:58.275 --> 41:02.405
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE

41:02.440 --> 41:06.045
And actually your face will be

41:06.080 --> 41:10.480
back in a minute because what we're going
to do now is pick up our art gallery film,

41:14.040 --> 41:17.920
James and I arrived by aeroplane
fresh from the south,

41:17.955 --> 41:20.120
Where do Geordies actually come from?

41:20.155 --> 41:22.645
Geordies are from the Northeast,

41:22.680 --> 41:25.480
Maybe they're all Geordies, Then
there's others, Foggies, aren't there?

41:25.515 --> 41:27.725
There's the Foggies and the
Muggies and the monkey hangers,

41:27.760 --> 41:30.340
 I don't know what they
are, Are they all types of Geordie?

41:30.375 --> 41:32.920
 Well I think so,
Or are they, maybe they're different,

41:32.955 --> 41:36.525
They all say why-aye so
they must all be Geordies,

41:36.560 --> 41:43.760
As our BMW art car was so valuable, I
decided to drive it to the exhibition myself,

41:46.400 --> 41:51.040
What I have here is a 3,5
litre straight six painting,

41:51.075 --> 41:55.680
It's art that moves you,
quite literally, moves you,

41:59.720 --> 42:03.365
At the Middlesbrough Institute Of
Modern Art, Captain Sense of Direction

42:03.400 --> 42:08.765
had decided to make an audio guide to that
would steer visitors around the exhibits,

42:08.800 --> 42:15.200
If you turn through almost 180 degrees to your left
or even to your right in fact because it of course

42:15.235 --> 42:20.320
makes no difference whatsoever and walk
straight ahead towards the wall and rotating to

42:20.355 --> 42:25.200
your right and not quite through 180
degrees but probably about 155,

42:26.960 --> 42:33.560
I, meanwhile was on the road, touring the local radio
stations in a bid to drum up some support for our show,

42:33.595 --> 42:35.437
This is fantastic,

42:35.472 --> 42:37.245
I've got a van,

42:37.280 --> 42:40.000
I've got a list of phone
numbers and I've got a mission,

42:40.035 --> 42:42.520
I'm a PR agent,

42:46.320 --> 42:50.765
And then walking through the white
door we arrive at the upstairs gallery,

42:50.800 --> 42:55.760
Actually, that's not right, You need to come out
and turn left or right if you haven't gone through

42:55.795 --> 42:57.920
the white door through the
glass door, which you push,

42:57.955 --> 43:01.685
You are then in
the upstairs gallery,

43:01.720 --> 43:05.440
The first stop on my publicity tour
was Radio Tees,

43:05.475 --> 43:09.160
Who cares about the weather
because it's the weekend,

43:09.195 --> 43:12.725
Who cares when Top Gear is in town,

43:12.760 --> 43:15.680
And Richard flipping Hammond is with
us, Yes!

43:15.715 --> 43:17.840
Here comes the publicity,

43:20.160 --> 43:26.800
Welcome to Teesside, You of course used to work
here many many years ago, why are you here?'

43:26.835 --> 43:29.520
Well, it's great to be here,
I did used to work here, apparently,

43:29.555 --> 43:33.240
I worked in a lot of radio
stations for not very long,

43:33.275 --> 43:36.125
What are you doing!

43:36.160 --> 43:37.805
'So yes I worked here... '

43:37.840 --> 43:41.960
Talk about the exhibition,
And I have fond memories of working here,

43:41.995 --> 43:46.097
Nobody's interested in your
bloody memories,

43:46.132 --> 43:50.200
Because I started in radio York
in 1989,

43:50.235 --> 43:53.485
Oh for crying out loud!

43:53.520 --> 43:57.360
For the rest of the interview Hammond
brilliantly publicised... himself,

43:57.395 --> 44:01.200
I've just started something up called
Blast Lab, a kids' science show,

44:01.235 --> 44:04.285
Oh, for God's sake,
This is ridiculous,

44:04.320 --> 44:08.245
To make matters worse
in the gallery May was busy

44:08.280 --> 44:12.725
ignoring our instructions to
make the audio guide interesting,

44:12.760 --> 44:16.880
As it was codenamed during development,
rejecting the complicated hydragas suspension

44:16.915 --> 44:20.725
of its forebear, the Allegro,
in favour of a straightforward

44:20.760 --> 44:27.800
steel-sprung chassis with a rear axle derived
from a design already used to great effect,

44:27.835 --> 44:29.320
Hello?

44:31.800 --> 44:34.240
Yeah, I'm doing it,

44:34.275 --> 44:36.125
I've just,

44:36.160 --> 44:37.960
Yes, I know it's got to be done by
it 3,30, But I can't do it because

44:37.995 --> 44:40.520
people keep ringing me up and
asking me if I've done it yet,

44:42.640 --> 44:49.000
As I bore down on Middlesbrough, Hammond's
publicity tour was going from bad to worse,

44:49.035 --> 44:52.525
Yes, I did, I started in 1989
at Radio York,

44:52.560 --> 44:59.280
'Yeah, absolutely, I think Total Wipeout
has been a tremendous success... '

44:59.315 --> 45:01.565
I'm going to have a heart attack!

45:01.600 --> 45:03.125
There's one where people
have to climb a platform and

45:03.160 --> 45:05.680
in front of them are four massive red
inflatable balls and they have to...

45:05.715 --> 45:09.240
Total Wipeout is just
idiots falling over,

45:09.275 --> 45:11.480
Talk about our art exhibition!

45:20.720 --> 45:24.085
The good people of Hartlepool,

45:24.120 --> 45:27.965
Hammond is in town with his
PR machine,

45:28.000 --> 45:32.280
At Mima, the other idiot was
in the gallery of motor-racing,

45:32.315 --> 45:34.965
A subject about
which he knows nothing,

45:35.000 --> 45:38.165
Some pictures of racing
cars going around corners...

45:38.200 --> 45:41.840
Hopefully, these cardboard boxes
won't be here by the time you arrive,

45:41.875 --> 45:43.725
There's a man on fire,

45:43.760 --> 45:46.680
There's a car going along, erm...

45:46.715 --> 45:49.320
And then I had a problem,

45:50.840 --> 45:53.920
I was coming round the corner
doing about 27mph

45:53.955 --> 45:56.365
and a cow was there,

45:56.400 --> 45:58.645
And I just had nowhere
to go because of this...

45:58.680 --> 46:03.080
I'd say there was a school bus... well it was
a bus full of children, handicapped children,

46:03.115 --> 46:05.685
and I saw some ginger
ones on so I just...

46:05.720 --> 46:08.440
I thought, well I'm going to have
to miss that, so I'll put it

46:08.475 --> 46:10.800
in the ditch rather than injure
the children,

46:10.835 --> 46:14.245
That story didn't wash,

46:14.280 --> 46:18.040
Take a deep breath, Sir, Lips around
the tube, constant stream of breath,

46:18.075 --> 46:20.000
Keep going, keep going, keep going,
thank you,

46:20.035 --> 46:21.645
The good news was, I scored zero,

46:21.680 --> 46:26.520
The bad news came when the car
was towed out of the ditch,

46:26.555 --> 46:31.005
That's not too...
It is quite bad, Oh, God,

46:31.040 --> 46:36.080
And my attempts to mask the damage
with T-Cut just made everything worse,

46:36.115 --> 46:39.680
ENGINE REVS

46:43.360 --> 46:46.605
This was an important
exhibit for us, this car,

46:46.640 --> 46:53.000
I'm casting around in my head for someone to
blame but it's just me, it keeps coming back at me,

46:53.035 --> 46:57.560
So, when we met up, I decided
to do the honourable thing,

46:57.595 --> 46:59.045
And go on the attack,

46:59.080 --> 47:00.885
Did you hear what he did on the...?

47:00.920 --> 47:04.200
 Yes, I did hear what you did on
the radio, I've been working my backside off,

47:04.235 --> 47:08.240
You have been and done one interview and
you talked about Blast Lab, Total Wipeout...

47:08.275 --> 47:10.360
He didn't ask the right questions, 
 I told you,

47:10.395 --> 47:12.685
I know more about PR than you,
I was on top of it,

47:12.720 --> 47:15.565
Listen, none of this detracts
from the fact, and I can read it in

47:15.600 --> 47:20.520
your face, that you've been an idiot
and you have ruined the whole event,

47:20.555 --> 47:22.765
By the way, Thanks for asking,

47:22.800 --> 47:25.480
I'm fine, We don't care,

47:25.515 --> 47:27.245
Evidently, No, it has not...

47:27.280 --> 47:32.800
As the exhibition was due to open the following
morning, we agreed to stop bickering and get to work,

47:32.835 --> 47:35.765
James went off to rouse the troops,

47:35.800 --> 47:38.840
And Richard
relaunched his PR campaign,

47:40.520 --> 47:42.885
My work is complete,
One mobile billboard,

47:42.920 --> 47:45.845
But better still,
just to really give the message,

47:45.880 --> 47:51.360
what I've done is actually put one of the exhibits
from the gallery, on the move, lit and everything,

47:51.395 --> 47:55.605
so that people can see it, I'll leave
the door open as I am driving around,

47:55.640 --> 47:58.605
THAT is PR,  I'm good,
Good,

47:58.640 --> 48:05.840
I was with Stephen Wiltshire, the artist famous
for creating detailed drawings from memory,

48:05.875 --> 48:09.120
So which bit of New York do you think
you're going to put behind the car?

48:09.155 --> 48:14.680
I'm going to
put the Brooklyn Bridge,

48:14.715 --> 48:16.320
Brooklyn Bridge, OK,

48:18.120 --> 48:22.800
Out on the streets, the PR machine
had adopted a more personal approach,

48:24.680 --> 48:26.325
People of Middlesbrough,

48:26.360 --> 48:30.720
Tomorrow morning is your opportunity to soak
up some art, Madame, in the black tracksuit,

48:30.755 --> 48:33.577
Sir, in the white tracksuit
top, you could visit Mima,

48:33.612 --> 48:36.400
You, young man, in the grey
black tracksuit trousers,

48:36.435 --> 48:37.885
You sir, in the blue tracksuit top,

48:37.920 --> 48:41.000
Tomorrow morning, nine o'clock at
Mima,

48:41.035 --> 48:44.045
Art is for the masses,
art is for you sir,

48:44.080 --> 48:48.000
In the black tracksuit trousers and you
young man in the blue tracksuit trousers,

48:48.035 --> 48:51.560
There is a festival of art
available for you,

48:54.280 --> 48:57.880
Back at the gallery it was all go,
Each of us had chosen what he

48:57.915 --> 49:00.677
thought was the
best-looking car of all time,

49:00.712 --> 49:03.405
And Jeremy and I were
busy installing them,

49:03.440 --> 49:06.960
Richard had gone for his
own, Series 1 Land Rover,

49:06.995 --> 49:09.937
Jeremy for a Ferrari 275 GTS,

49:09.972 --> 49:12.845
No, it is absolutely terrific,

49:12.880 --> 49:17.000
I bet if you turn the radio on it'll just be
the beginning of The Italian Job, That music,

49:17.035 --> 49:19.765
And I'd gone for a
Lamborghini Countach,

49:19.800 --> 49:23.520
How long have you talked about the
Lamborghini Countach for on the audio tape?

49:23.555 --> 49:25.680
Please tell me it's no
more than two seconds,

49:25.715 --> 49:28.245
A few minutes,

49:28.280 --> 49:30.285
It's a very important car,

49:30.320 --> 49:32.965
So, this idea that...
seriously James...

49:33.000 --> 49:34.965
Yes, but you're only thinking in
terms of numbers of people coming

49:35.000 --> 49:37.480
 through, which I know is an honourable
ambition... Yes, that's the goal,

49:37.515 --> 49:40.085
Yes, but they have to come to a
gallery and experience some art,

49:40.120 --> 49:45.800
OK, what's this James? This is how I want
to see the people of Middlesbrough, OK,

49:48.520 --> 49:52.960
On your left, there's a Lamborghini Countach,
that's a Ferrari 275 GTS and there's a Land-Rover,

49:52.995 --> 49:56.137
In here,
we've actually got some art,

49:56.172 --> 49:59.245
That's the speed
I want them to be doing,

49:59.280 --> 50:05.240
If they saunter, if they're standing there,
saying, Oh, look at the wire wheels and the seats...

50:05.275 --> 50:06.765
The log jam,

50:06.800 --> 50:10.480
There was, however, a more immediate
problem, Oh, hang on a minute,

50:10.515 --> 50:15.085
Hang on, Is it too wide?

50:15.120 --> 50:16.605
Well, yeah, We cannot not have it,

50:16.640 --> 50:19.160
Can't it just be there?
 Well, not really,

50:19.195 --> 50:23.400
Eventually, the Countach was
bought in on a special giant thing,

50:23.435 --> 50:28.285
And with that done,
we went to check on Stephen,

50:28.320 --> 50:32.880
So that's four hours, And it's gone from a blank
piece of paper to that James, in four hours,

50:32.915 --> 50:37.440
 That's extremely good,
How many times have you been to this place,

50:37.475 --> 50:40.125
Twice, in the Brooklyn Heights,

50:40.160 --> 50:46.880
So you remember the detail on this bridge, just from
standing here two times?  Yeah,

50:46.915 --> 50:49.165
That car is astonishing,

50:49.200 --> 50:54.840
I know, You're pedantic on these things,
That is really accurate,  Spot on,

50:59.760 --> 51:03.600
Darkness fell but still
Hammond's PR onslaught rumbled on,

51:03.635 --> 51:05.325
We've stuffed the Mima
gallery full of things

51:05.360 --> 51:08.285
that people want to go and see,
Obviously, it's automotive themed...

51:08.320 --> 51:13.200
And long into the night, James and I were
arguing about where the art car should go,

51:13.235 --> 51:18.080
So what, you want to position it to draw
people's attention to the bit you crashed?

51:18.115 --> 51:20.000
Well, yes, No, I disagree,

51:20.035 --> 51:23.285
OK, it needs to be...

51:23.320 --> 51:25.720
Leave it like that, Please
go, get on with your next job,

51:25.755 --> 51:27.760
I'm very happy, Leave it there,

51:39.600 --> 51:45.205
Show day, And amazingly, our
exhibition was looking rather good,

51:45.240 --> 51:50.605
We had installed many thought-provoking
pieces including, Stig World,

51:50.640 --> 51:58.200
A video installation where visitors get a
glimpse of what goes on inside his helmet,

51:58.235 --> 52:02.680
We also had our ground-breaking
masterpiece called, What's Europcar

52:02.715 --> 52:08.285
Going To Say About This?,
and obviously Our BMW art car,

52:08.320 --> 52:14.060
We knew that all of this would bring in the
multitudes and prove that motoring is the way forward

52:14.095 --> 52:19.800
for the nation's art galleries, so we went on
to the roof for our first glimpse of the queues,

52:19.835 --> 52:21.560
We'll be able to look at
the crowd from over here,

52:21.595 --> 52:23.240
Are you ready, steady...

52:25.200 --> 52:26.800
It's not that big, is it?

52:29.480 --> 52:31.845
It was a disaster,

52:31.880 --> 52:36.440
And the news from the outlying
car-parks was even worse,

52:36.475 --> 52:39.480
It was like a scene from Omega Man,

52:41.440 --> 52:45.880
It's now 10 to 10, As you can see,
we've been open for 15 minutes,

52:45.915 --> 52:47.400
And there is just...

52:56.360 --> 53:00.005
There, officially now,
the people looking after

53:00.040 --> 53:03.165
the exhibits, outnumbering the
number of people looking at it,

53:03.200 --> 53:08.040
My carefully-prepared personal
lectures were a complete waste of time,

53:08.075 --> 53:12.280
For me, the artist has managed
to avoid any kind of branding,

53:12.315 --> 53:14.600
It's just simply pure...

53:17.720 --> 53:24.200
To hit our targets we needed 800 visitors
an hour but it just wasn't happening,

53:24.235 --> 53:26.685
I am just doing a
rough head count here,

53:26.720 --> 53:29.120
That's about... It's not a lot,

53:29.155 --> 53:31.565
Around 75 people, tops,

53:31.600 --> 53:36.520
By midday the numbers had picked up a bit but
instead of following the prescribed route through

53:36.555 --> 53:42.237
the gallery, everyone was all over the
place thanks to James' useless audio guide,

53:42.272 --> 53:47.920
'And then walking through the white
door, we arrive at the upstairs gallery,'

53:47.955 --> 53:49.605
'Actually, that's not quite right,'

53:49.640 --> 53:52.480
'Into the next room,
The door of which should be open,'

53:52.515 --> 53:55.120
HIGH-PITCHED ALARM BLARES

53:55.155 --> 53:58.925
'Bloody Nora,'

53:58.960 --> 54:01.880
'Yeah, but I can't do it because people keep
ringing me up and asking me if I've done it yet,'

54:06.520 --> 54:09.120
'I can't even turn it off,'

54:09.880 --> 54:15.000
Worse still, Hammond had forgotten
to do his homework on the exhibits,

54:15.035 --> 54:16.965
That's a Ferrari 275 GTS,

54:17.000 --> 54:20.160
As you can see, the lines are...

54:20.195 --> 54:22.680
It's lovely,

54:25.640 --> 54:28.320
 Nice colour,
Yes, it is a lovely colour, yes, it is,

54:28.355 --> 54:31.325
We called an emergency meeting,

54:31.360 --> 54:33.680
OK, right, what are we
doing, what are we doing?

54:35.800 --> 54:37.685
Don't skid away, let's just relax,

54:37.720 --> 54:40.645
Please... What is going to
work about it? This is a catastrophe, James,

54:40.680 --> 54:44.760
 It's not a catastrophe...
It's a catastrophe,

54:44.795 --> 54:47.445
Plainly, Hammond's
PR had been rubbish,

54:47.480 --> 54:50.920
So, to bring in the crowds
we needed to find one,

54:50.955 --> 54:52.725
And we did,

54:52.760 --> 54:57.325
FOOTBALL FANS CHANT

54:57.360 --> 54:59.245
At half-time, we would
make a hearts and minds

54:59.280 --> 55:04.040
appeal for the Middlesbrough fans
to come to our show after the match,

55:04.075 --> 55:09.040
Sadly, though, we put Captain
Geordie in charge of our outfits,

55:14.480 --> 55:18.720
BOOING AND WHISTLING

55:22.480 --> 55:24.040
Is this not...?

55:27.840 --> 55:29.320
Give us a minute,

55:36.000 --> 55:39.200
CHEERING

55:41.520 --> 55:44.325
People of the Northeast,

55:44.360 --> 55:46.720
We apologise for
that terrible mistake,

55:48.440 --> 55:54.040
We are here to ask... Please, we have
an art exhibition at the Mima Gallery,

55:54.075 --> 55:59.760
we need your support,
we have Ferraris, Lamborghinis,

55:59.795 --> 56:01.680
we have Richard
Hammond's Land Rover,

56:04.280 --> 56:06.400
Er, anything else?
No, Oh, there's one thing,

56:06.435 --> 56:09.685
Nottingham, You can't come,

56:09.720 --> 56:12.925
The away fans responded with
good grace,

56:12.960 --> 56:17.320
# You fat bastard, you fat bastard
you fat bastard... #

56:17.355 --> 56:18.480
You fat bastard!

56:23.600 --> 56:25.960
Amazingly, though, our plan worked,

56:25.995 --> 56:27.920
In you come,

56:30.200 --> 56:33.205
If you start shuffling
through that way,

56:33.240 --> 56:38.400
Soon the place was packed, which meant
I could finally unveil our centrepiece,

56:38.435 --> 56:43.080
Without a doubt, the highlight,
the highlight of the show so far,

56:45.640 --> 56:48.645
How much do you have to
hate somebody

56:48.680 --> 56:53.400
to sit down with a piece of
cloth and then do that to him?

56:55.440 --> 56:59.525
Among the crowd was a learned art scholar who
could see James' sculpture for what it was,

56:59.560 --> 57:04.080
 Are you saying it's a bit crap, 
tts:color=lime0 Yeah, Nothing to see, Nothing to see,

57:04.115 --> 57:08.245
The crowds, though, meant we had a
new problem with a James' audio guide,

57:08.280 --> 57:15.040
Not only was it still getting everybody lost but
as I'd feared it was also extremely long-winded,

57:15.075 --> 57:17.725
'And latterly, to
5,2 litres, an expansion'

57:17.760 --> 57:21.000
'that was accompanied by the
fitment of a new cylinder head... '

57:21.035 --> 57:22.245
PHONE RINGS 
tts:color=cyan0 'Hello,'

57:22.280 --> 57:26.085
This meant the visitors weren't
moving through the gallery fast enough,

57:26.120 --> 57:29.920
Have you been listening to the audio guide?
 Yeah, How is it?

57:29.955 --> 57:32.085
Pretty boring,

57:32.120 --> 57:36.880
With bottlenecks springing up everywhere
there was no way we'd get the numbers through,

57:36.915 --> 57:40.325
So I was forced to shorten
my personal lectures a bit,

57:40.360 --> 57:44.325
Right, everybody, there's only one
interesting thing in here

57:44.360 --> 57:47.200
and it's that painting there of the
Bentley, Good, you've seen it, off we go,

57:47.235 --> 57:49.845
There we are, that's
a BMW, we've done it,

57:49.880 --> 57:52.520
In here's a Formula One car
with some paint on it, lovely,

57:52.555 --> 57:54.245
Right, out, Out,

57:54.280 --> 57:57.445
Out, you, you, off you go,

57:57.480 --> 58:01.280
James, however, simply didn't
get the idea of this at all, Does he know?

58:01.315 --> 58:03.217
Does a cat know it's a cat?

58:03.252 --> 58:04.986
Does a dog know when its old,

58:05.021 --> 58:06.720
What does he actually know?

58:08.240 --> 58:10.045
What are you doing
with them up there?

58:10.080 --> 58:12.605
Well, I'll tell you
exactly what's happening,

58:12.640 --> 58:16.920
Everybody's getting into a room where
James May is talking and they're stuck,

58:16.955 --> 58:21.205
This called for drastic measures,

58:21.240 --> 58:25.280
These are stink bombs, So
in machine terms he's extremely bright but he's inanimate,

58:25.315 --> 58:31.600
Does he have any feelings? Can we transfer
our own feelings on to the crash-test dummy?

58:31.635 --> 58:34.285
Sorry,

58:34.320 --> 58:38.365
Rodin's Thinker, He's sort of naked,

58:38.400 --> 58:42.120
Ooo, bit of an itch, The point of
art is, you have to interact with it, You don't just look at it,

58:45.040 --> 58:46.800
What's that stink?

58:49.000 --> 58:52.165
Sorry about that, it's
unfortunate, but...

58:52.200 --> 58:56.360
OK, if you'd like to move to the exits
now, tremendous, thank you for leaving here,

58:56.395 --> 59:00.085
Sorry about the smell, I've
no idea how that happened,

59:00.120 --> 59:07.760
Soon the crowds were moving along at a fair old
pace, which meant there wasn't much more we could do,

59:07.795 --> 59:10.760
We've got the best
exhibits that we could have got, Yep,

59:10.795 --> 59:13.720
We've done the best
PR that we can do,

59:13.755 --> 59:15.885
Oh yeah,

59:15.920 --> 59:21.080
It's now time for us to bail out
and let the numbers roll in,

59:21.115 --> 59:23.717
With that, Back to the studio,

59:23.752 --> 59:26.320
I finally got to say that,

59:27.920 --> 59:30.040
APPLAUSE

59:30.075 --> 59:32.725
OK,

59:32.760 --> 59:34.160
I have the figures here, remember...

59:35.680 --> 59:37.805
Remember, we had to beat 30,000,

59:37.840 --> 59:42.480
Yes, so... And
what we actually managed was 50,000,

59:42.515 --> 59:44.897
Yes, yes,

59:44.932 --> 59:46.946
No, no, 15,

59:46.981 --> 59:48.925
15,000,

59:48.960 --> 59:51.680
Oh,
so, a half of what we needed then,

59:51.715 --> 59:54.445
Yeah, we were halfway there,

59:54.480 --> 01:00:00.125
But, this is still an all-time
record for the Mima Gallery,

01:00:00.160 --> 01:00:03.520
Yes, That is brilliant,  
We did it,

01:00:03.555 --> 01:00:05.560
We sort of did it, We did something,

01:00:05.595 --> 01:00:07.245
Cars are the future of art,

01:00:07.280 --> 01:00:12.085
They are and that is a bombshell
and that means we can end,

01:00:12.120 --> 01:00:19.120
Now, we're back on December 27th with an elongated
special in which we drive across South America,

01:00:19.155 --> 01:00:21.965
That is quite something,
But until then,

01:00:22.000 --> 01:00:25.760
Have a very, very happy Christmas,
Take care, Good night,

01:00:25.795 --> 01:00:28.600
