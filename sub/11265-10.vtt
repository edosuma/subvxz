WEBVTT

00:02.508 --> 00:04.878
DIETRICH: And so, to reiterate...

00:04.912 --> 00:07.046
HARRIS: Due to your various
relationships with the victim,

00:07.080 --> 00:09.783
Ellis Crane, both
professional and personal...

00:09.815 --> 00:13.653
DIETRICH: You are all persons of interest
in an active homicide investigation.

00:13.686 --> 00:15.555
(ALL GRUMBLING)

00:15.589 --> 00:17.458
Wait. Can't you eliminate
us by testing our hands

00:17.491 --> 00:20.561
- for gunshot residue? Hmm?
- Wha... Y-Yes!

00:20.594 --> 00:21.320
Yes, we can.

00:21.345 --> 00:23.497
And that's exactly what
we're gonna do, smart guy.

00:23.530 --> 00:25.299
- So...
- Think you're so goddamn smart.

00:25.332 --> 00:28.836
So we're gonna need everybody
to come down to the station,

00:28.869 --> 00:32.406
so, uh, we can test your
hands for gunshot residue!

00:32.439 --> 00:35.808
Yeah, hi. Alan Shapiro,
attorney for Veronica Deane?

00:35.842 --> 00:37.912
- God, she is so great!
- Huge fan. Huge!

00:37.945 --> 00:39.680
- Ohhh!
- Yeah. Super.

00:39.713 --> 00:42.849
But my client will not be
frog-marched into a police station

00:42.882 --> 00:45.418
like a common criminal before
God knows how many cameras,

00:45.452 --> 00:48.087
every one of which was
tipped off by the LAPD!

00:48.120 --> 00:49.589
I-I... Well, no. No. (COUGHS)

00:49.623 --> 00:52.326
- We wouldn't want that.
- She will, however...

00:52.358 --> 00:55.495
consent to the test being
conducted at my office.

00:55.528 --> 00:57.263
Thank you. That's very accommodating.

00:57.296 --> 00:59.265
Get a load of Obi-Wan-Attorney.

00:59.298 --> 01:00.867
So, should we head there now, or...

01:00.900 --> 01:03.336
No, let's say tomorrow. Elevenish?

01:03.370 --> 01:05.272
- Elevenish it is!
- Looking forward to it.

01:05.304 --> 01:07.107
- Are you kidding me?
- How is that fair?

01:07.140 --> 01:09.843
- Why does she get special treatment?
- Because she is special.

01:09.876 --> 01:13.280
- She's... a movie star!
- Yeah. Because she's special.

01:13.313 --> 01:16.016
Well, I don't really want to go down
to the police station either, so...

01:16.048 --> 01:18.618
Goddamn it! You will comply!

01:18.652 --> 01:21.287
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey hey...
It's all good, buddy!

01:21.320 --> 01:23.456
She's comin' down to the station.

01:23.489 --> 01:25.292
- Comin' down to the station, right?
- Uh, yup.

01:25.325 --> 01:27.795
See? She's comin' down to the station.

01:27.828 --> 01:30.798
Yeah! 'Cause I remember you, Lana Kane.

01:30.831 --> 01:32.633
You're still on probation for the
gun charge and the stalking.

01:32.665 --> 01:34.968
- It was a hamentashen!
- Yeah.

01:35.001 --> 01:36.970
Well, you're not gonna "yummy Jewish
cookies" your way out of this one.

01:37.004 --> 01:39.239
Ah! I couldn't have murdered Ellis.

01:39.271 --> 01:42.141
I was in Veronica's dressing room
ripping Archer like a rented mule!

01:42.174 --> 01:44.911
(LAUGHS) Oh, man, you never rent a mule.

01:44.944 --> 01:46.913
- So wait a second...
- You lease that surly bastard.

01:46.947 --> 01:48.716
- Shut up! So wait...
- Shut up!

01:48.748 --> 01:52.085
So, your alibi is that you were
busy committing felony assault.

01:52.119 --> 01:53.920
- Yes!
- She's a real menace.

01:53.954 --> 01:55.823
Shut up, and they all saw me.

01:55.855 --> 01:57.557
- I didn't.
- What?

01:57.591 --> 01:59.492
Yes, you did! I was right there!

01:59.526 --> 02:00.828
- Nope.
- You little...

02:00.860 --> 02:02.829
- Shapiro! You saw me!
- Did I?

02:02.863 --> 02:04.431
- What?
- Because what I don't see...

02:04.464 --> 02:06.667
is how that helps my
client, Veronica Deane.

02:06.699 --> 02:07.900
- (GASPS) - Huge fan.
- So great.

02:07.933 --> 02:10.068
- Archer...
- Yes, Lana?

02:10.103 --> 02:12.006
Would you care to tell the detectives...

02:12.038 --> 02:13.740
that I couldn't have killed Ellis...

02:13.774 --> 02:15.842
because I was busy beating your ass?

02:15.876 --> 02:17.911
- I would love to.
- (DEEP SIGH)

02:17.943 --> 02:20.079
- There. See?
- Unfortunately...

02:20.113 --> 02:20.939
Goddamn it!

02:20.964 --> 02:23.417
I must have gotten a
bonk on the noggin,

02:23.449 --> 02:26.286
- because I can't remember anything!
- Ohahhh!

02:26.318 --> 02:28.521
So, Miss Kane, you can ride with me...

02:28.555 --> 02:30.024
I'll call a van for the rest of you.

02:30.056 --> 02:32.358
And remain with you in a
supervisory capacity.

02:32.391 --> 02:37.397
- Because. Whatever you do...
- You are not to wash your hands!

02:41.568 --> 02:43.838

03:25.235 --> 03:27.271
Yeah, so listen. The
whole thing about...

03:27.298 --> 03:29.366
not washing our hands...

03:29.400 --> 03:32.537
But, darling, they were so terribly
goopy from our love-making!

03:32.570 --> 03:34.371
Which was so wonderful, darling.

03:34.405 --> 03:36.775
Wasn't it just... so... wonderful.

03:36.808 --> 03:39.043
Well, yeah. I mean, it almost always is,

03:39.077 --> 03:41.145
both wonderful and goopy, but...

03:41.179 --> 03:44.315
But, darling, surely you don't think
that I could have murdered Ellis?

03:44.347 --> 03:48.219
- No! I mean... you know...
- After all, he was killed at 2:14,

03:48.251 --> 03:51.555
and I was in here with you, until
almost the very stroke of 3:00.

03:51.589 --> 03:53.892
Which you were extremely clear about.

03:53.924 --> 03:55.559
And repeatedly, come to think of it.

03:55.592 --> 03:58.295
- But there's no clock in here, so...
- What do you think...

03:58.328 --> 04:00.165
about... Mexico?

04:00.198 --> 04:02.400
Like, their extradition treaty, or...

04:02.432 --> 04:04.802
No, you goose. As a romantic getaway!

04:04.835 --> 04:08.172
Oh. Well, then, theoretically,
me gusto mucho.

04:08.205 --> 04:09.148
But...

04:09.173 --> 04:11.975
I have a fabulous
bungalow in Las Caletas.

04:12.008 --> 04:14.578
- Just down the beach from John Huston.
- Really?

04:14.612 --> 04:16.579
Hmm. You could hit his
house with a coconut.

04:16.613 --> 04:18.015
Which I've always wanted to do.

04:18.048 --> 04:19.750
We could be there in four hours.

04:19.783 --> 04:23.754
Is... But is now a great time,
or even a not very bad time?

04:23.787 --> 04:25.823
What with the whole
murder investigation...

04:25.857 --> 04:27.424
Oh, Alan can handle that.

04:27.458 --> 04:28.993
But until all the fuss dies down,

04:29.025 --> 04:30.929
we could swim in the ocean...

04:30.962 --> 04:34.765
swim in tequila, dance naked
on the beach by firelight...

04:34.799 --> 04:37.001
Prank John Huston with some coconuts...

04:37.033 --> 04:40.604
Besides, it looks like that enormous
Lana Kane person is the real killer.

04:40.638 --> 04:43.041
What? No, I-I shouldn't
have joked about that.

04:43.073 --> 04:45.710
- I'll tell the cops she...
- She certainly had a motive.

04:45.742 --> 04:48.178
I mean, my God, the
victim's jealous lover?

04:48.212 --> 04:51.015
Yeah, hey, uh, you know what?
My hands are pretty goopy, too.

04:51.047 --> 04:53.550
I'm just gonna pop out, give
'em a quick rinse, and...

04:53.583 --> 04:55.386
Well, just use the sink here, silly.

04:55.419 --> 04:58.790
- Uh, no. I have diarrhea, so...
- (KNOCKING)

04:58.823 --> 05:01.793
Miss Deane? I have kind
of a fanboy request.

05:01.826 --> 05:04.195
And you can't let those fans down!

05:04.227 --> 05:07.131
- See, I... Oh.
- Yeah.

05:07.165 --> 05:09.633
- I...
- I have diarrhea.

05:09.667 --> 05:12.070
- You better not wash those hands!
- I won't!

05:12.102 --> 05:14.472
- I'd like your word, please!
- You have it!

05:14.504 --> 05:16.140
Great police work.

05:16.174 --> 05:19.977
Seriously? What is it with
everybody washing their hands?

05:20.011 --> 05:22.647
Exactly! I'm not going
to be the only chump

05:22.679 --> 05:25.316
walking into that police
station with unwashed hands!

05:25.349 --> 05:27.218
(HIGH-PITCHED VOICE) Oh, man!

05:27.251 --> 05:30.155
- (TOILET FLUSHING)
- We gotta wash our hands?

05:30.188 --> 05:32.157
What? No! They said, "Don't wash them."

05:32.189 --> 05:34.091
CAROL: Wait, what are we all washing?

05:34.124 --> 05:36.326
Goddamn it, wash everything!

05:36.359 --> 05:38.562
Geez! Make up your mind, America!

05:38.595 --> 05:40.931
And I need to talk to you. Now.

05:40.965 --> 05:43.167
MALORY: All right, Grabney Coleman!
What?

05:43.201 --> 05:45.102
(SIGHS) It's about the murder.

05:45.136 --> 05:48.273
Oh, Sterling, I know exactly
what you're going to say.

05:48.306 --> 05:50.909
- You do?
- And I know exactly what to do.

05:50.941 --> 05:52.843
- You do.
- Sterling, it's me.

05:52.876 --> 05:55.679
Of course I do, just like I knew
you were headed for trouble

05:55.713 --> 05:58.850
the minute you laid your eyes
on that washed-up old crone.

05:58.883 --> 06:01.019
Oh, for... She's like 50!

06:01.052 --> 06:03.287
Also, maybe, a little a lot crazy.

06:03.321 --> 06:06.924
- Oh, really? An actress?
- Who's crazy?

06:06.958 --> 06:08.859
Nobody. Get out of here, Krieger!

06:08.893 --> 06:11.796
- With your goddamn human breast milk.
- Okay! Geez!

06:11.828 --> 06:13.364
And it's not human!

06:13.397 --> 06:15.700
I don't know if that's better or worse.

06:15.732 --> 06:18.268
Anyway, now I'm worried the cops might
actually think Lana did it, so...

06:18.302 --> 06:19.636
Mexico.

06:19.669 --> 06:21.872
Wait? Yeah. That's what she said.

06:21.905 --> 06:25.376
Well, it's obvious. It's basically
right next door, for God's sake.

06:25.408 --> 06:28.212
As if Los Angeles needed another minus.

06:28.246 --> 06:30.982
Come... I don't know, mother.
Fleeing to Mexico?

06:31.015 --> 06:32.884
It just kinda screams, "I'm guilty."

06:32.917 --> 06:37.789
So, no one is technically fleeing,
because no one is under arrest.

06:37.821 --> 06:38.631
Yet.

06:38.656 --> 06:41.059
So you're saying now would
be the best time to go? If...

06:41.092 --> 06:43.294
If there could ever be a "best time"

06:43.326 --> 06:46.964
to have your picture taken with a
donkey painted to look like a zebra.

06:46.998 --> 06:49.467
Hmm, pretty sure those are real zebras.

06:49.499 --> 06:51.068
- Typical.
- Who's a zebra?

06:51.102 --> 06:53.571
Goddamn it, Krieger. I
told you to... Wait.

06:53.604 --> 06:55.740
- How did you change so fast?
- Oh! Um...

06:55.773 --> 06:59.744
Don't engage him! You need to be on the
first mode of transport to Mexico.

06:59.777 --> 07:02.479
Don't even bother packing,
just grab a fake passport

07:02.513 --> 07:04.415
at the office and go...

07:04.448 --> 07:07.085
But first, wash your gunpowdery hands.

07:07.117 --> 07:08.852
My... Wait. You don't think I did it?

07:08.886 --> 07:11.422
- Wh... Who else?
- Veronica!

07:11.455 --> 07:13.258
- Who's Veronica? - Jesus!
- What the...

07:13.290 --> 07:15.192
Why are your frickin' cyborgs here?

07:15.225 --> 07:18.528
Because we're getting 30
bucks a day as extras! Each!

07:18.561 --> 07:20.264
- Who is?
- Well, get the hell out of here.

07:20.297 --> 07:22.833
- All of you!
- No! Now wait a minute.

07:22.866 --> 07:24.602
This could actually help you!

07:24.635 --> 07:27.372
To do what? Open an Adolf E. Cheese?

07:27.405 --> 07:30.775
Krieger, you have one of these
god-awful monstrosities

07:30.807 --> 07:33.110
- for each of us?
- No!

07:33.143 --> 07:36.780
- Maybe. Yes.
- There you go! You go to Mexico,

07:36.814 --> 07:38.883
your robo-doppelganger takes the fall,

07:38.915 --> 07:41.451
you come back after he gets the chair.

07:41.484 --> 07:44.021
- Ohh...
- First of all, I didn't do it!

07:44.054 --> 07:46.290
- I doesn't matter!
- I feel like it does!

07:46.323 --> 07:49.193
- It's not always about you!
- Wha... And second of all,

07:49.225 --> 07:51.696
there's no way one of
these damn "inepticons"

07:51.729 --> 07:53.631
could pass the fricking Turing test!

07:53.664 --> 07:54.507
(SHOCKED GASPS)

07:54.532 --> 07:57.035
Oh, they can totally
pass the Turing test.

07:57.068 --> 07:59.637
What is that? A thing from Star Wars?

07:59.669 --> 08:03.040
No, it's a test to see if a
machine's artificial intelligence

08:03.073 --> 08:05.876
can convince a human that
the machine is also human.

08:05.910 --> 08:09.580
Which they totally can. Go ahead.
Ask them anything about anything.

08:09.613 --> 08:12.083
Ugh. Okay, uh, let's see.

08:12.115 --> 08:14.318
What is love?

08:14.351 --> 08:17.487
(ELECTRONIC STROKE) Batubatu... battery.

08:17.521 --> 08:19.324
Wh-wh-wh-wha...

08:20.925 --> 08:22.994
- (SCREAMS)
- (SIGHS)

08:23.027 --> 08:26.598
- Now I have to wash my hands again.
- (SHORT-CIRCUIT ZAPPING)

08:34.965 --> 08:37.385
Goddamn it, this is classic Archer!

08:37.409 --> 08:39.546
- Oh, yeah?
- He knows I didn't kill Ellis!

08:39.580 --> 08:41.881
But he's so goddamn immature,
he thinks it's funny

08:41.914 --> 08:45.285
to watch the mother of his
child hauled off to jail.

08:45.318 --> 08:47.654
Which, by the way, is a
total waste of time,

08:47.687 --> 08:50.390
because you are not gonna
find any gunshot residue

08:50.423 --> 08:52.992
- on my hands.
- Uh, you never know.

08:53.025 --> 08:55.662
No, actually, I do know, because...
I'm sorry...

08:55.696 --> 08:57.298
- And that means what?
- What?

08:57.331 --> 09:00.401
- You never know...
- Uh, figure of speech?

09:00.433 --> 09:02.502
Oh, really? Because
from where I'm sitting,

09:02.535 --> 09:04.571
which by the way is in
a black woman's skin,

09:04.605 --> 09:06.740
in the back of a prowler
with no door handles

09:06.773 --> 09:09.310
driven by a white cop,
it sounds like the LAPD

09:09.342 --> 09:10.910
is gonna frame me for murder.

09:10.943 --> 09:13.981
Like I said, "You never know!"

09:14.014 --> 09:16.182
Oh, damn it!

09:16.216 --> 09:17.985
No-o-o!

09:18.018 --> 09:21.021
You maniac! You blew him up!

09:21.053 --> 09:26.092
Aw, damn you! Goddamn you all to hell!

09:26.125 --> 09:27.995
Oh, give it a rest.

09:28.028 --> 09:31.599
That'll do, Milkly, that'll do.
(SOBBING)

09:31.631 --> 09:33.833
- And here. Hold this.
- Wait. What? No.

09:33.866 --> 09:36.269
- I don't want to...
- Hold it! Hold it right there!

09:36.303 --> 09:38.606
Man down! Man down! Man down!

09:38.639 --> 09:40.774
Man? It's basically an appliance.

09:40.807 --> 09:42.776
- (SHOCKED SIGH)
- What the hell happened here?

09:42.808 --> 09:44.444
- What's happening?
- Don't y'all know?

09:44.477 --> 09:46.947
That is what I'm trying to find...
Damn it, woman!

09:46.980 --> 09:49.115
I thought I told you not
to wash your hands!

09:49.149 --> 09:50.951
Yeah, I'm almost positive you did.

09:50.984 --> 09:53.620
Okay. Nobody move. Nobody do anything.

09:53.654 --> 09:56.689
In fact, everybody put your
hands in your damn pockets!

09:56.722 --> 09:58.692
- All right, you heard the man.
- (SIGHS)

09:58.725 --> 10:00.360
- Let's go. - Whatever.
- Okay, okay.

10:00.394 --> 10:02.363
- Ugh.
- (PHONE RINGING)

10:02.395 --> 10:05.064
Hey. Yeah, I need you to come
back to the studio real quick.

10:05.097 --> 10:08.301
No, the van's not here, but it looks
like we've got another homicide...

10:08.335 --> 10:11.739
Uh, just in the very brief
time since you left, yes.

10:11.772 --> 10:13.807
What are ya, shootin' 'em yourself?

10:13.840 --> 10:16.476
How... Uh... Okay. Shut up.
I'm almost at the station,

10:16.509 --> 10:18.312
just wait for the van, dummy.

10:18.345 --> 10:20.814
Well, sweetheart, today just
might be your lucky day.

10:20.846 --> 10:23.082
What? You're gonna park in
an alley, and let me go

10:23.115 --> 10:25.818
- if I give you a blow job?
- Mmmm... no.

10:25.851 --> 10:28.988
They made us quit doing that. There
was a whole big thing about it.

10:29.022 --> 10:31.825
- Then why am I suddenly so lucky?
- Because it looks like...

10:31.857 --> 10:34.093
- maybe the killer struck again.
- Ha!

10:34.126 --> 10:36.763
Told you! Dumbass idiot cops!

10:36.797 --> 10:38.999
So, how's it feel to be such an idiot?

10:39.032 --> 10:42.235
Mm, I guess... almost like
there's a vast number of things

10:42.269 --> 10:45.505
that can happen to you between
now and when you're released

10:45.538 --> 10:48.174
from police custody, and
almost none of them are good?

10:48.207 --> 10:51.178
Um. Point. Taken.

10:51.211 --> 10:53.681
Let's go, folks. Nothing to see here.

10:53.713 --> 10:57.116
- What on earth is going on?
- Because whatever it is, my client had

10:57.149 --> 10:59.019
absolutely nothing to do with it!

10:59.052 --> 11:01.021
Come on, beat it! 23 skidoo!

11:01.053 --> 11:04.524
Hey! You need to get your
old, tiny, fake policeman ass

11:04.557 --> 11:07.794
out of my space! I'm trying
to do real policeman shit!

11:07.827 --> 11:10.029
Then arrest her! For murder!

11:10.062 --> 11:11.865
You can't murder a machine!

11:11.898 --> 11:14.134
Yeah, that's like the
first law of robotics.

11:14.167 --> 11:16.202
No, it's the exact opposite of that!

11:16.235 --> 11:19.807
Well, excuse me, Dr. Han Fastolfe.

11:19.840 --> 11:21.475
- Too obscure?
- I mean...

11:21.508 --> 11:23.043
The point is, legally speaking,

11:23.076 --> 11:25.211
a murder victim has to be a human being.

11:25.245 --> 11:28.215
- That is true.
- Besides, it's your word against mine.

11:28.248 --> 11:30.150
No, it isn't! Because all my K-bots

11:30.182 --> 11:32.152
have a digital recorder in their CPU.

11:32.184 --> 11:34.487
You can't record me
without my permission!

11:34.520 --> 11:38.991
That is also true. California is
a two-party consent state, so...

11:39.024 --> 11:41.728
Actually, in California, you
can record a conversation

11:41.761 --> 11:43.731
without the other party's
consent, if you believe

11:43.764 --> 11:46.066
- it will collect evidence of a crime.
- Aha!

11:46.099 --> 11:48.402
But you didn't know a
crime was going to occur

11:48.434 --> 11:49.902
when you started recording!

11:49.936 --> 11:53.907
Aha! But also, isn't the question moot?

11:53.939 --> 11:58.077
Because that dude's CPU's...
totally dickholed.

11:58.110 --> 12:01.314
Aha! But his CPU is working perfectly!

12:01.347 --> 12:04.918
- And he witnessed everything! Copley?
- Yep, yep, yep!

12:04.951 --> 12:08.322
Please rewind to Milkly's heinous
murder and play it back for us.

12:08.355 --> 12:10.591
- All righty...
- None of this is admissible!

12:10.624 --> 12:12.426
And more importantly, they're robots.

12:12.458 --> 12:14.260
Accessing digit... al...

12:25.404 --> 12:29.942
Aw, thank God. Okay. Gunshot
residue testing and the truth...

12:29.976 --> 12:31.611
shall set you free!

12:31.644 --> 12:33.947
Or not. But get in that van!

12:33.980 --> 12:36.350
- With the exception of my client!
- Of course.

12:36.383 --> 12:38.952
(LAUGHS) Absolutely. And
thank you for the autograph.

12:38.985 --> 12:42.055
That was so great, and you're just...
so great!

12:42.087 --> 12:45.024
And this is all a huge waste of time.

12:45.057 --> 12:47.961
(CHUCKLES) Well, yes! Because
it's so totally obvious

12:47.994 --> 12:49.696
that Lana Kane murdered Ellis.

12:49.729 --> 12:50.964
Uh, hang on. Actually...

12:50.996 --> 12:53.132
As a matter of fact, Mr. Shapiro will be

12:53.165 --> 12:55.701
presenting you evidence of Miss
Kane's guilt tomorrow morning.

12:55.735 --> 12:57.538
- He what? - Do what?
- I what?

12:57.571 --> 13:00.807
- Isn't that what you told me?
- Uh, yes?

13:00.841 --> 13:03.543
So, Detective. See you at elevenish?

13:03.577 --> 13:05.479
Oh, yes. (LAUGHING) Yes.

13:05.511 --> 13:08.981
So great. The rest of
you, asses in the van!

13:09.014 --> 13:11.485
- You'd better do something.
- Let's go! Come on!

13:11.518 --> 13:14.053
- Get in there!
- But, Veronica, what about Mexico?

13:14.086 --> 13:15.822
We may not need to go, after all.

13:15.856 --> 13:18.057
But the coconuts. The naked tequila.

13:18.091 --> 13:21.260
- Can't we at least talk about it?
- All right, darling. Calm down.

13:21.293 --> 13:23.396
Come to my house
tonight, and we'll talk.

13:23.429 --> 13:25.665
Yo! Faceman! In the van! Now!

13:25.698 --> 13:28.101
Okay. There's a nice way to do that.

13:28.134 --> 13:29.603
See ya tonight.

13:29.635 --> 13:33.005
- (SIGHS) Okay, is everybody in?
- (EVERYBODY) Yes!

13:33.038 --> 13:34.508
Okay, count off!

13:34.540 --> 13:35.675
(IN UNISON) One...

13:35.708 --> 13:37.944
Goddamn it. Would you go?

13:37.977 --> 13:39.846
But, Veronica, what evidence?

13:39.880 --> 13:41.682
- Well, my darling Alan...
- (VAN STARTING)

Okay, come on. I'll brief
you while we get ready.

- Excuse me.

15:19.085 --> 15:21.701
Do you have any idea how
long this is going to take?

15:21.726 --> 15:23.127
Yes.

15:23.161 --> 15:25.431
At this rate, we'll be here all night.

15:25.464 --> 15:29.100
Or forever, once Veronica Deane fakes
her whatever bullshit evidence on me.

15:29.133 --> 15:32.370
Thanks to you and Archer, who
lied to the cops with her.

15:32.403 --> 15:34.873
- Hope you're happy!
- Uh, duh... Free cornrows.

15:34.907 --> 15:37.942
- Lana, Sterling feels awful about that.
- Phht!

15:40.077 --> 15:42.714
working on a plan to trap Veronica Deane

15:42.748 --> 15:44.282
so there's no need to worry.

15:44.316 --> 15:46.317
ARCHER: Are you sure?

15:46.350 --> 15:48.620
Yes! Trust me, it's a good plan.

15:48.653 --> 15:51.556
It just kind of seems a little more
complicated than it needs to be.

15:51.590 --> 15:53.893
No, it isn't. Shut up. It'll work.

15:53.926 --> 15:56.795
Hmm. Also, why are we wearing tuxedos?

15:56.827 --> 15:59.631

Although, I have to say...

16:25.556 --> 16:28.526
I prefer my margaritas
on the beach in Mexico.

16:28.559 --> 16:32.530
Mm, yes, of course! And we'll dance
naked on the beach in Mexico...

16:32.562 --> 16:34.864
after... Oh, my!

16:34.897 --> 16:38.868
Is that a gun in your pocket,
or are you just glad to see me?

16:38.902 --> 16:41.238
Oh! Uh, both. Sorry.

I'll just lay this right
here, on this table.

16:44.775 --> 16:47.578

16:47.611 --> 16:50.980
Well, after they formally charge
Lana Kane with Ellis's murder.

16:51.014 --> 16:53.417
- And... you think they will.
- Oh, I should think so.

16:53.450 --> 16:56.053
Once they find her enormous
fingerprints on the gun.

with all the details,

18:12.863 --> 18:15.732
and science, which actually I
don't even understand, so...

18:15.766 --> 18:18.502
So, all this time, you
knew that I killed Ellis.

18:18.535 --> 18:21.572
Well, I suspected. All that
"stroke of three" stuff?

18:21.604 --> 18:25.174
Then you were trying so hard
to make Lana look guilty?

18:25.208 --> 18:27.811

over here, just because

18:27.844 --> 18:29.813
I was mad at her... I mean, Jesus!

- I'm such an idiot.
- Oh, I wouldn't say that, darling.

18:33.016 --> 18:34.919
You caught me, didn't you?

18:34.951 --> 18:38.255
- Well, yeah, but...
- You knew that I was secretly having

18:38.287 --> 18:40.156
all these shoots sabotaged,

18:40.190 --> 18:42.692
because Sandpiper-Crane was
insuring the productions

18:42.726 --> 18:45.463
for ten times what they could
ever make at the box office!

18:48.632 --> 18:52.268
- Yes.
- Well, bravo, Archer. Bravo.

18:52.302 --> 18:55.940
Well, wait! So Longwater was all
just a grubby little insurance scam?

18:55.972 --> 18:58.675
Little? It was a massive insurance scam,

18:58.709 --> 19:00.611
and also a re-insurance scam,

19:00.643 --> 19:02.947
not to mention a stock
manipulation scam...

19:02.979 --> 19:05.950
with a little help from those
odious twits at Stratton-Whitney!

19:05.982 --> 19:06.874
Wait, what?

19:06.899 --> 19:09.552
Their hedge fund shorted the
insurance company's stock.

19:09.585 --> 19:12.855
- We made millions!
- (GUFFAWS) I mean, Jesus!

19:12.889 --> 19:15.626
And all this time, I thought
it was just a sex tape!

19:15.659 --> 19:18.128
Oh. That actually was a sex tape,

19:18.161 --> 19:20.229
which I accidentally
recorded onto a disk

19:20.263 --> 19:21.632
with some Longwater evidence.

19:21.664 --> 19:23.800
Oh, well, that's just stupid.

you just confessed.

19:26.002 --> 19:27.904
Yes, darling, but only to you.

19:27.938 --> 19:29.974
Doesn't do you a bit of
good without a witness.

19:30.007 --> 19:32.642
- Uh, dahoy?
- What, the robot?

19:32.675 --> 19:36.379
No, not a robot! Again, I don't
understand all the science, but...

19:36.412 --> 19:39.315
(LAUGHING) Robots can't
testify in court.

19:39.348 --> 19:41.818
Oh, I know that. But wait. Hang on...

19:41.852 --> 19:44.988
Plus, it didn't hear what I said,
because... spoiler alert...

19:45.021 --> 19:47.657
- it's dead!
- Wait, but... Goddamn it!

19:47.690 --> 19:50.494
So, no, Archer. I didn't confess.

19:50.527 --> 19:54.064
Not to a crime, anyway. But I'm
afraid I do have to confess

19:54.096 --> 19:56.400
that... ohh...

19:56.432 --> 19:59.603
I really could have fallen for you.

19:59.635 --> 20:01.504
- Really?
- My God, yes.

20:01.537 --> 20:03.606
- But unfortunately... - (GUNSHOT)
- (GROANS)

20:03.640 --> 20:05.676
(GASPING)

20:05.709 --> 20:07.577
- Goddamn it.
- (GUN CLICKS)

20:07.611 --> 20:09.747
- Goddamn it!
- (GUN CLATTERS)

20:09.779 --> 20:13.416
Veronica! (GRUNTS) Veronica!

20:13.450 --> 20:14.617
- (CLATTERING)
- Ow. Wha...

20:14.651 --> 20:16.854
(COUGHS) Who puts a table there?

20:16.886 --> 20:18.588
(FOOTSTEPS)

20:18.622 --> 20:21.425
Archer? Archer.

20:21.458 --> 20:24.862
- Archer!
- That would be Ms. Archer to you.

20:24.894 --> 20:26.930
Oh! I'll make a note.

20:26.962 --> 20:29.700
You're free to go. Actually,
you're all free to go.

20:29.732 --> 20:31.200
- Really?
- (ALL CHATTERING)

20:31.234 --> 20:32.870
But I haven't even been tested yet.

20:32.902 --> 20:36.206
You don't need to get tested,
they have a suspect.

20:36.238 --> 20:37.874
- Veronica Deane.
- Ha!

20:37.908 --> 20:39.810
- (SURPRISED CHATTER)
- Geezy Petes!

20:39.843 --> 20:43.212
This whole time, I thought Ellis Crane...
was the one behind all this.

20:43.246 --> 20:46.883
Yeah, right up until he shot himself
through both the wrist and the face.

20:46.917 --> 20:50.054
Anymahoo, apparently
she shot another guy.

20:50.086 --> 20:52.556
Floating in her pool as we speak.

20:52.588 --> 20:54.390
(GASPS) Sterling!

20:54.423 --> 20:56.893
(CHATTER ON POLICE RADIO)

20:56.927 --> 20:59.329
HARRIS: Well, what do you think?

20:59.362 --> 21:02.065
DIETRICH: I think that in my next life,
I'm gonna come back as a movie star.

21:02.098 --> 21:03.733
Yeah. Look out, gay porn.

21:03.767 --> 21:05.568
- Rimshot.
- Yeah, that could be your name.

21:05.602 --> 21:07.403
So what, some movie star lives here?

21:07.437 --> 21:09.740
Yes. Veronica Deane. Don't you remember?

21:09.773 --> 21:11.809
She's a person of interest in
the other murder we're working.

21:11.842 --> 21:13.911
- No shit.
- Wait, what are you...

21:13.943 --> 21:16.079
You were just questioning
her ten hours ago!

21:16.113 --> 21:18.181
He was her alibi.

21:18.215 --> 21:20.851
- You like her?
- As an actress, or for this homicide?

21:20.883 --> 21:22.853
- Both.
- Loved her in Shanghai Moon.

21:22.885 --> 21:25.021
- Oh, my God, that dress?
- Right?

21:25.055 --> 21:27.423
But as for Tennessee Tuxedo
here, I want to talk to her.

21:27.457 --> 21:29.860
See if she knows who tried
to weight him down...

21:29.892 --> 21:33.096
with an ounce of lead. Found it on
the ground, over there by the table.

21:33.130 --> 21:35.265
- Is it hers?
- Hard to tell with no serial number.

21:35.297 --> 21:36.899
Yeah, probably why
they put them on there.

21:36.924 --> 21:37.433
Rimshot.

21:37.467 --> 21:40.771
Hey, you should ask Veronica Deane
if her agent reps gay porn stars.

21:40.804 --> 21:42.339
And maybe if she murdered this guy.

21:42.372 --> 21:44.775
- Ah, you got a real knack for this.
- Rim Schott.

21:44.807 --> 21:46.276
Yeah, you don't have
to say it every time.

21:46.308 --> 21:48.612
No, as my gay porn name. Not bad.

21:48.644 --> 21:50.113
- Let me through!
- Whoa, whoa, whoa!

21:50.146 --> 21:51.714
- Hey, this is a crime scene!
- Hang on, hang on!

21:51.748 --> 21:53.883
Sterling! (GASPS)

21:53.917 --> 21:56.053
(ALL SHRIEKING)

21:56.085 --> 21:58.555
(SOBBING)

21:58.587 --> 22:02.291
- Thanks. Thanks, assholes!
- Yeah. Yeah, right?

22:02.325 --> 22:04.061
- (GASPS)
- Archer?

22:04.094 --> 22:05.962
(SHOCKED CHATTERING)

22:05.996 --> 22:08.799
Bet she hasn't cried like
that since Prohibition.

22:08.832 --> 22:10.566
- You little...
- Ow!

22:10.600 --> 22:12.469
- Ow! Cut it...
- Had me worried sick!

22:12.501 --> 22:15.806
Mother! Ow! Stop it. I
am gut-shot, woman!

22:15.838 --> 22:18.142
By Veronica Deane, by the way,

22:18.174 --> 22:20.978
and I will be... more than
happy to testify to that.

22:21.010 --> 22:22.311
Damn! (SIGHS)

22:22.344 --> 22:23.814
Any idea where she is?

22:23.846 --> 22:26.583
Probably Mexico. Go to
John Huston's house,

22:26.615 --> 22:29.318
- and start throwing coconuts.
- Which I've always wanted to do.

22:29.352 --> 22:31.655
But... What? Okay, wait.
How are there two of you?

22:31.688 --> 22:34.491
They've got robots. It's cool. We've
already been through all this. So...

22:34.524 --> 22:36.660
- Okay, A: They're not robots.
- Nobody cares.

22:36.692 --> 22:39.997
And B: they're obviously good
enough to pass the Turing test.

22:40.029 --> 22:41.764
- Oh, totally.
- Whatever that is.

22:41.797 --> 22:43.599
Okay, you're all free to go!

22:43.633 --> 22:46.402
- Including you, Miss Kane.
- With our sincere apologies.

22:46.436 --> 22:48.338
Yeah... Not accepted. But...

22:48.371 --> 22:50.274
Speaking of... Archer,

22:50.306 --> 22:52.175
is there anything you'd
like to say to me?

22:52.209 --> 22:56.180
(SIGHS) Yes, Lana. There is.

22:56.212 --> 22:59.582
(GASPING, EXCLAMATIONS)

22:59.615 --> 23:01.652
What's happening? What are we doing?

23:02.485 --> 23:04.854
Lana Kane...

23:04.888 --> 23:08.692
(CYBORG CRASHING)

23:08.725 --> 23:10.961
No-o-o!

23:10.994 --> 23:12.196
(HYSTERICAL TEARS AND SCREAMING)

23:12.229 --> 23:14.096
Wait, what just happened?

23:14.130 --> 23:17.200
Holy shitsnacks!

23:17.234 --> 23:20.604
Wait. But if that's a cyborg...

23:20.636 --> 23:22.739
That means... the man in the pool is...

23:25.174 --> 23:29.946
MALORY: Ster-ling!

23:29.979 --> 23:33.183
