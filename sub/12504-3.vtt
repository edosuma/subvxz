00:06.274 --> 00:08.176
[Emily] Previously on
Make It or Break It:

00:08.209 --> 00:10.544
You're banging your secretary?

00:10.578 --> 00:13.081
[man] It's Emily Kmetko,
the scholarship kid.

00:13.114 --> 00:14.515
Mystery woman over here.

00:14.548 --> 00:16.584
What go you got?
Some big, old secret life?

00:16.617 --> 00:20.054
- No. But, I keep myself busy.
- You don't wrap your hands?

00:20.088 --> 00:23.291
When I'm flying through the air,
everything else in my life
completely disappears.

00:23.324 --> 00:25.593
I spend every waking minute...

00:25.626 --> 00:27.561
...thinking of ways
that we can be together.

00:27.595 --> 00:29.330
So far, no one knows
that Marty's been lost.

00:29.363 --> 00:31.465
Houston knows.
They want Payson.

00:31.499 --> 00:33.467
We've been friends
for 10 years.

00:33.501 --> 00:35.203
Why didn't you tell me
about you and Carter?

00:35.236 --> 00:36.304
Because, it's not true.

00:38.406 --> 00:40.141
[rock music playing]

00:40.174 --> 00:44.178
* She's such a
small town girl *

00:44.212 --> 00:48.216
* Starting to see the light

00:48.249 --> 00:52.386
* She's coming up for air

00:52.420 --> 00:58.292
* These things are never
Easy to figure out *

00:58.326 --> 01:02.463
* Winning is all you've got

01:02.496 --> 01:06.467
* Sometimes you
just can't hide *

01:08.169 --> 01:09.270
[Alex] Kaylie.

01:09.303 --> 01:11.372
You want to stop dragging your
butt and get over here!

01:11.405 --> 01:12.540
I need to chalk up, Dad.

01:14.542 --> 01:18.612
* She's gonna
break his heart *

01:18.646 --> 01:23.117
* She's gonna rescue me

01:23.151 --> 01:26.154
* She's gonna save my heart

01:29.290 --> 01:33.494
* She'd known him forever

01:33.527 --> 01:37.231
* And she loved him too

01:37.265 --> 01:41.535
* But I guess
we all get older *

01:41.569 --> 01:45.373
* Sometimes you just
Do what you gotta do *

01:45.406 --> 01:48.409
[Carter] T-minus-five means my
truck in five minutes, remember?

01:48.442 --> 01:50.144
Sorry, somebody beat me
to the chalk box.

01:50.178 --> 01:51.845
- I was freezing out there.
- Yeah, well...

01:51.879 --> 01:55.716
Guess we have to find
a better means of communication
than a communal bucket of chalk.

01:58.619 --> 01:59.620
Gotta go.

01:59.653 --> 02:03.691
* She's gonna set him free

02:03.724 --> 02:08.196
* She's gonna break his heart

02:08.229 --> 02:11.599
* She's gonna save my heart *

02:31.219 --> 02:32.286
[Alex] Kaylie.

02:32.320 --> 02:34.322
We have got to get more height
on that Shushunova.

02:34.355 --> 02:36.457
- Yep.
- Keep those legs straight.

02:36.490 --> 02:38.192
OK.

02:38.226 --> 02:40.561
I thought Bela Karolyi
was a slave driver.

02:40.594 --> 02:43.231
I swear if my father doesn't
find a real coach soon

02:43.264 --> 02:44.632
I'm gonna join the carnival.

02:44.665 --> 02:48.602
We're gonna need work permits,
tattoos and gypsy names.

02:48.636 --> 02:50.204
OK, no one is joining
the carnival.

02:50.238 --> 02:52.473
Easy for you to say. You've
have gyms begging for you.

02:52.506 --> 02:54.342
Yeah, but it's not
like I want to go.

02:55.543 --> 02:57.511
I know. I just...

02:57.545 --> 03:00.348
I don't think I can do this
alone if you end up in Houston.

03:00.381 --> 03:01.749
Sure you can.

03:01.782 --> 03:04.752
So, what happens if
we don't have a coach?

03:04.785 --> 03:06.454
Can we not go to Nationals?

03:06.487 --> 03:08.222
Without a star coach...

03:08.256 --> 03:09.557
...you just won't
be seen the same way.

03:09.590 --> 03:12.426
[Alex] Kaylie! It's not
called practice for nothing.

03:12.460 --> 03:15.763
- Let's see your beam.
- I swear, I'm going to lose it.

03:15.796 --> 03:18.266
Coming.

03:21.402 --> 03:24.438
[Steve]
Excuse me! Mr. Belov?

03:25.573 --> 03:28.242
Mr. Belov?
Steve Tanner.

03:28.276 --> 03:30.278
I'm sorry for just
showing up like this.

03:30.311 --> 03:32.246
But, I've tried
to contact you and...

03:32.280 --> 03:35.649
The reason I didn't return your
call is I have no interest
in your offer.

03:37.585 --> 03:39.520
Look, it's been five years...

03:39.553 --> 03:42.256
...since you dropped out.
You're fading into obscurity.

03:42.290 --> 03:44.658
For a man of your talents,
that's gotta be hard to watch.

03:44.692 --> 03:46.527
Not if you don't watch.

03:46.560 --> 03:49.663
You expect me to believe the
coach who reinvented the sport

03:49.697 --> 03:52.600
- doesn't even watch it anymore?
- I don't know you, Mr. Tanner,

03:52.633 --> 03:55.669
so I don't expect you
to believe anything.

03:57.838 --> 04:00.007
The truth is, I have no
interest in gymnastics.

04:00.040 --> 04:02.776
I haven't for many years.
That's that.

04:04.712 --> 04:08.716
You assembled what is perhaps
the greatest team in the history
of the sport.

04:08.749 --> 04:10.751
I think you can do it again.

04:10.784 --> 04:14.355
And I'm prepared to offer you
whatever money it takes to make
that happen.

04:14.388 --> 04:19.327
You think I left England
to compete in Romania
because I want money?

04:19.360 --> 04:20.694
Who do I look like,
David Beckham?

04:20.728 --> 04:24.465
Yes, actually,
you kinda do.

04:25.766 --> 04:27.868
I'm sorry you wasted
your time, Tanner.

04:30.371 --> 04:31.372
All right.

04:33.741 --> 04:36.477
Tell your daughter Lauren
she's piking her layouts.

04:36.510 --> 04:40.047
It's costing her at least
a tenth of a point.

04:40.080 --> 04:42.850
I thought you stopped
watching gymnastics?

04:42.883 --> 04:45.853
You don't fish, do you, Tanner?

04:45.886 --> 04:49.623
- Uh, no, I...
- It wasn't a question.

04:49.657 --> 04:52.593
See, fishing is all about
finding the right lure.

04:52.626 --> 04:55.429
And that club team you had
back at The Rock...

04:55.463 --> 04:58.666
That was the best
I've seen in a decade.

04:58.699 --> 05:01.669
And then you took your daughter
and my old friend Marty Walsh
to Denver.

05:01.702 --> 05:04.338
[Steve] Look. That's...

05:04.372 --> 05:06.807
That's just it, I can get rid
of Marty in Denver and...

05:06.840 --> 05:10.411
I'm not interested in Denver.

05:10.444 --> 05:11.612
If The Rock was
still together,

05:11.645 --> 05:13.414
we might have had
something to talk about.

05:16.817 --> 05:18.619
You see, Tanner,

05:18.652 --> 05:21.555
when you broke
those girls up...

05:21.589 --> 05:23.624
...you lost your lure.

05:23.657 --> 05:25.593
[Sasha] Excuse me.

05:33.801 --> 05:36.437
Drive, Kaylie.

05:36.470 --> 05:37.538
Kaylie, push through.

05:41.509 --> 05:45.446
Oh, you've got to throw your
head back on that ring leap!

05:45.479 --> 05:47.915
Don't forget to smile!
I gotta see teeth!

05:47.948 --> 05:50.651
I can't focus
with you yelling at me.

05:50.684 --> 05:52.453
And this is not
a toothpaste commercial!

05:55.623 --> 05:57.558
[Steve] Gee, I hope, uh...

05:57.591 --> 05:59.527
...hope we haven't
come at a bad time?

05:59.560 --> 06:01.429
[Alex] What the hell
are you doing here?

06:01.462 --> 06:03.731
[Steve] Now don't be that way.
I come bearing gifts.

06:03.764 --> 06:06.934
Yeah, well you can get back on
the Trojan Horse you rode in on.

06:06.967 --> 06:09.703
Because we don't need
anything from you.

06:09.737 --> 06:12.540
[Steve] Ah, but you do my
friend. You need a coach.

06:12.573 --> 06:14.842
And I just happen to have
the best in the business.

06:14.875 --> 06:17.711
[Kaylie] No way we're
letting Lauren back.

06:17.745 --> 06:21.749
If someone doesn't hold me
back, she's gonna get my heel
up her bleach blonde head.

06:21.782 --> 06:22.950
I'm not holding you back.

06:22.983 --> 06:24.752
There's no way we take
you or Marty back.

06:24.785 --> 06:26.754
Who said anything about Marty?

06:28.522 --> 06:29.523
Oh, my God.

06:32.660 --> 06:34.528
Oh, my God.

06:34.562 --> 06:36.697
Is that...?

06:36.730 --> 06:38.666
Sasha Belov.

07:08.662 --> 07:10.698
[Alex] You think you
can waltz back in here

07:10.731 --> 07:12.866
like nothing happened just
because you have Sasha Belov?

07:12.900 --> 07:14.668
Ah, yeah, Alex.

07:14.702 --> 07:17.738
I'm offering you a world
class coach, people.

07:17.771 --> 07:19.873
You should be
kissing my... feet.

07:19.907 --> 07:22.476
It'll be a cold day in hell
before I kiss anything of yours.

07:22.510 --> 07:23.711
Now you're just
hurting my feelings.

07:23.744 --> 07:25.513
Come on gentlemen,
this isn't productive.

07:25.546 --> 07:28.015
What happened to Marty
and Denver?

07:28.048 --> 07:30.918
Look, Lauren misses her
friends here at The Rock.

07:30.951 --> 07:32.019
These girls should
be together...

07:32.052 --> 07:33.621
It's Sasha Belov.

07:33.654 --> 07:35.789
What is there to discuss?
This is awesome.

07:35.823 --> 07:37.625
Not if Lauren 's
part of the package.

07:37.658 --> 07:40.694
- Who cares? It's Sasha Belov!
- I care.

07:40.728 --> 07:42.896
Whatever happened to your
foot upside her head?

07:42.930 --> 07:44.665
Kaylie!

07:44.698 --> 07:46.033
It's Sasha Belov!

07:46.066 --> 07:47.801
[Alex] How do we know
the next time your
daughter stomps her feet

07:47.835 --> 07:50.237
that you won't leave and
take this coach with you?

07:50.270 --> 07:52.673
So, that's what it was about?
My daughter throwing a tantrum?

07:52.706 --> 07:54.608
[Alex] That's exactly
what it was about.

07:54.642 --> 07:56.977
No, no, no.
We built this together...

07:57.010 --> 07:59.813
[Alex and Steve arguing]

07:59.847 --> 08:01.582
[Alex] We're trying
to get to the Olympics

08:01.615 --> 08:03.984
and you took our coach and left!

08:05.619 --> 08:07.588
[Lauren] Hey Chelsea.
I love your new bangs.

08:07.621 --> 08:08.856
They're major.

08:08.889 --> 08:10.758
Thanks, just
got 'em yesterday.

08:18.932 --> 08:21.068
You're looking good Carter.

08:21.101 --> 08:23.704
Ah. Thanks.

08:28.809 --> 08:29.677
Where's he going?

08:31.645 --> 08:32.713
Wait. Payson.

08:35.749 --> 08:36.684
They'll be back.

08:43.323 --> 08:44.958
Mr. Belov?

08:44.992 --> 08:46.627
Mr. Belov? Wait.
Where are you going?

08:46.660 --> 08:49.062
- Home. To Cambria.
- Why?

08:49.096 --> 08:51.965
Because your parents seem
to think they're the ones
doing me a favor.

08:51.999 --> 08:53.667
Please, let us talk to them.

08:54.334 --> 08:55.769
You can't leave.

09:00.708 --> 09:02.009
You're Payson Keeler.

09:03.777 --> 09:06.647
You... You know who I am?

09:09.717 --> 09:11.652
Wait, wait.

09:11.685 --> 09:13.787
We need you here.

09:28.736 --> 09:31.772
You think you can get the
grown-ups to stop behaving
like children?

09:38.011 --> 09:40.013
[Alex] No parents on the floor?
That's a new one.

09:40.047 --> 09:42.650
Well, can you blame him?

09:42.683 --> 09:43.651
[Steve] Look...

09:43.684 --> 09:46.119
We all want the same thing.

09:46.153 --> 09:47.821
For our girls
to kill at Nationals

09:47.855 --> 09:49.122
and make the Olympic Team.

09:49.156 --> 09:51.625
Sasha's the coach
who'll get them there.

09:51.659 --> 09:52.660
So in the meantime...

09:52.693 --> 09:55.195
Can't we all
just get along?

10:09.943 --> 10:12.780
- Does the man speak?
- Shhh.

10:22.890 --> 10:26.694
You are all very special.

10:28.696 --> 10:30.964
You've chosen to do something
few people are capable of.

10:32.232 --> 10:33.834
Look at each other.

10:34.835 --> 10:36.169
Go on, look.

10:40.207 --> 10:42.676
[Sasha] No one but your peers
can understand what it takes

10:42.710 --> 10:44.745
to be the best gymnasts
in the world.

10:44.778 --> 10:46.246
No one.

10:47.214 --> 10:49.817
Which is why you
need each other.

10:52.853 --> 10:54.221
But mostly...

10:54.254 --> 10:56.089
...you need me.

10:56.123 --> 10:59.693
I have a few simple rules.

10:59.727 --> 11:01.962
Work as hard as I do.

11:01.995 --> 11:05.733
Care as much as I do.
Sacrifice as much as I do.

11:05.766 --> 11:10.838
You will live, breathe, eat,
sleep, bleed gymnastics.
And nothing else.

11:10.871 --> 11:12.973
We have only 49 days
until Nationals.

11:13.006 --> 11:17.044
And you will spend every waking
moment of it in this gym.

11:17.077 --> 11:18.879
Together.

11:21.782 --> 11:24.985
Go home and say goodbye
to your lives as you know it.

11:25.018 --> 11:28.722
And any one of you not willing
to sacrifice your blood,

11:28.756 --> 11:31.859
sweat and tears
to achieve excellence...

11:33.961 --> 11:35.729
...shouldn't bother
to come back.

11:38.531 --> 11:40.968
We begin Monday morning,
five AM.

11:47.240 --> 11:48.776
That's all.

11:57.818 --> 11:59.519
- Five AM?
- He's right.

11:59.552 --> 12:01.789
We only have 49 days
until Nationals.

12:01.822 --> 12:04.524
And he expects us to spend
every waking minute here?

12:04.557 --> 12:08.161
Where else? He is the coach
that can make us great.

12:08.195 --> 12:10.530
Yeah, Payson.
If he doesn't kill us first.

12:10.563 --> 12:13.100
I need a Spruce Juice fix.

12:13.133 --> 12:15.836
- Who's up for a Spruce Juice?
- I'm in.

12:15.869 --> 12:16.669
That's our place.

12:16.703 --> 12:19.873
She used to be
a part of... "our."

12:20.841 --> 12:21.809
Hey, Em.

12:21.842 --> 12:25.078
Payson and I are going
to Spruce Juice. You in?

12:26.079 --> 12:28.215
- Uh...
- My treat.

12:30.117 --> 12:32.219
Sure, Kay. I'd love to go.

12:40.027 --> 12:42.562
Lauren's daddy may have bought
her way back into The Rock,

12:42.595 --> 12:45.232
but she's not buying her way
back into our group.

12:46.900 --> 12:48.201
Oh, you don't have
to buy me my drink.

12:48.235 --> 12:50.537
I know you just invited
me to piss Lauren off.

12:50.570 --> 12:52.139
- [both] No.
- [Payson] We didn't.

12:52.172 --> 12:55.308
It's fine.
I'm happy to be of service.

12:57.344 --> 12:59.346
[Payson] Can't get over
how amazing this is.

12:59.379 --> 13:02.249
I know, she's got a lot of
nerve following us around.

13:05.018 --> 13:06.820
No. I was talking
about Sasha Belov!

13:06.854 --> 13:08.355
- Oh.
- We just went

13:08.388 --> 13:10.958
from having no coach to having
the best coach in the world.

13:10.991 --> 13:12.559
Who hasn't coached
in five years.

13:12.592 --> 13:15.963
And who wants us to eat,
sleep and bleed gymnastics.

13:15.996 --> 13:18.098
- This is gonna be...
- Awesome.

13:18.131 --> 13:19.967
[Chelsea]
Happy birthday, Lauren.

13:20.000 --> 13:21.401
[giggles] Thank you.

13:22.402 --> 13:23.603
Oh, that's right.

13:23.636 --> 13:25.205
Today's Lauren's birthday.

13:25.238 --> 13:27.841
[Lauren] My dad's taking
me to Le Privilege tonight.

13:27.875 --> 13:30.577
That little French place
in the foothills? Swanky.

13:30.610 --> 13:32.145
We always do something special.

13:33.280 --> 13:35.115
Just the two of us.

13:35.148 --> 13:36.616
I feel sort of bad.

13:36.649 --> 13:38.986
We used to celebrate all of our
birthdays together.

13:39.019 --> 13:40.854
Whatever. Don't feel bad.

13:40.888 --> 13:44.624
It's not our fault that
she's not our friend anymore.

13:44.657 --> 13:46.259
As if uber-coach wasn't
stressful enough,

13:46.293 --> 13:48.361
now we gotta train with
the bitch of the beam.

13:48.395 --> 13:52.099
It sounds like Sasha's gonna
be on us like bad spray tan.

13:52.132 --> 13:54.634
I'm already maxed out in
the pressure department.

13:54.667 --> 13:56.970
- I need a vacation.
- [man] Check it out.

13:59.206 --> 14:00.240
Here you go, lovelies.

14:00.273 --> 14:02.876
You are cordially invited.

14:02.910 --> 14:05.145
- We're not interested.
- Who says?

14:05.178 --> 14:07.047
Blast off? What's that?

14:07.080 --> 14:08.982
[man] Only the biggest
kegger of the year.

14:09.016 --> 14:11.251
Music, bands and all the beer
you can drink.

14:11.284 --> 14:12.319
It's gonna be dope!

14:12.352 --> 14:15.322
Sounds awesome. Thanks.

14:16.689 --> 14:17.657
Let's go.

14:17.690 --> 14:19.126
We just ordered.

14:19.159 --> 14:20.894
To the kegger, Payson.

14:20.928 --> 14:23.396
No. No. We cannot go
to a kegger.

14:23.430 --> 14:25.899
Why not?
It's Saturday night.

14:25.933 --> 14:27.634
Our lives aren't over
until Monday.

14:27.667 --> 14:30.170
Come on. Let's go do
something fun for once!

14:30.203 --> 14:32.139
What's fun about a party?

14:32.172 --> 14:34.007
Oh, my God. I cannot believe
you just said that.

14:34.041 --> 14:35.008
[chuckles]

14:35.042 --> 14:37.377
Have you ever even been
to a high school party?

14:38.478 --> 14:41.048
- No.
- Have you?

14:41.081 --> 14:42.649
Um, yeah, a few.

14:42.682 --> 14:44.417
- What's it like?
- Well...

14:44.451 --> 14:46.386
Music, dancing...

14:46.419 --> 14:48.055
They can be a lot of fun.

14:48.088 --> 14:50.323
- Oh.
- And they can be stupid.

14:50.357 --> 14:51.658
We could definitely
use some fun.

14:51.691 --> 14:54.194
That's exactly
what we don't need.

14:54.227 --> 14:55.428
What if we got caught?

14:55.462 --> 14:56.463
By who?

14:57.497 --> 14:59.432
By our new coach.

14:59.466 --> 15:01.434
- And how would he find out?
- Thank you.

15:01.468 --> 15:05.472
I'm just so sick of jumping
through hoops I can scream.

15:05.505 --> 15:09.943
Don't you wonder what it would
be like to go to a big party?

15:09.977 --> 15:12.479
Yeah and I'm happy to keep
waiting until I'm at
the Olympic Village.

15:12.512 --> 15:14.381
[Kaylie] No, Payson.

15:14.414 --> 15:16.483
This is our last chance
to do something like this.

15:16.516 --> 15:18.451
- Forget it.
- Fine.

15:18.485 --> 15:20.988
I'll go by myself.

15:24.424 --> 15:25.492
Or...

15:25.525 --> 15:28.095
Emily, we can go together.

15:28.128 --> 15:31.731
I mean, since you have
experience and all.

15:31.764 --> 15:34.267
Come on, lets blow it out
before our lives are over.

15:35.235 --> 15:36.436
OK, yeah. I'll go.

15:36.469 --> 15:38.071
I haven't checked out
the scene in Boulder.

15:38.105 --> 15:40.373
Yes! This is gonna
be off the chain!

15:44.544 --> 15:48.248
OK, I'll go. But just to
keep the two of you guys
out of trouble.

15:48.281 --> 15:51.118
[Kaylie] This is gonna be so
awesome! We're gonna party
like Rock stars.

15:51.151 --> 15:52.285
Do you get it?

15:52.319 --> 15:54.087
The Rock...

15:54.121 --> 15:56.356
- Stars...
- Yeah, we get it.

15:57.390 --> 16:00.260
[Kaylie] Woo-hoo! Woo!

16:11.171 --> 16:13.773
- Hey.
- I'm totally screwed.

16:13.806 --> 16:15.508
Fine thanks, how was your day?

16:15.542 --> 16:17.277
What?

16:17.310 --> 16:19.279
Oh, you go.

16:19.312 --> 16:22.382
Well, the good news
is we have a new coach.

16:22.415 --> 16:26.419
And not just any coach.
The coach. Sasha Belov.

16:26.453 --> 16:28.355
Wow. And the bad news?

16:28.388 --> 16:32.492
He wants us to train
seven days and nights week.

16:32.525 --> 16:34.027
- How am I gonna work?
- Well...

16:34.061 --> 16:35.328
...at least Ronnie Cruz
got Mom a job.

16:35.362 --> 16:37.364
Yeah. For as long as it lasts.

16:38.398 --> 16:39.532
- Yeah.
- What are you doing?

16:39.566 --> 16:41.568
Well, I'd like to say
surfing the web

16:41.601 --> 16:45.038
but I think someone
forgot to pay the phone bill.

16:45.072 --> 16:46.473
What?

16:49.609 --> 16:52.212
Merry Christmas! Ho, ho, ho!

16:55.148 --> 16:56.183
It's June.

16:56.216 --> 16:58.051
Well, it's
better late than never!

16:58.085 --> 17:00.820
- You went shopping?
- Not just for myself.

17:00.853 --> 17:02.455
For you. Voilà.

17:02.489 --> 17:05.192
Oh yeah!
* It's getting hot in here *

17:05.225 --> 17:07.494
Whoo! And for you
my little star gazer...

17:07.527 --> 17:09.129
October Sky!

17:09.162 --> 17:10.497
Your favorite movie!

17:10.530 --> 17:13.066
No, no, no. You need to
take all of this stuff back.

17:13.100 --> 17:14.367
Why?

17:14.401 --> 17:16.603
Because we can't even
pay the phone bill!

17:16.636 --> 17:19.606
And you've been working
for exactly one day.

17:19.639 --> 17:22.209
Somebody needs to be
responsible around here.

17:27.514 --> 17:28.515
[door closes]

17:29.616 --> 17:32.519
[Mark] Sasha Belov
is an egomaniac.

17:32.552 --> 17:35.355
Aren't they all?

17:35.388 --> 17:37.390
It says:

17:37.424 --> 17:40.627
"As a gymnast he won,
in '96, the Gold."

17:40.660 --> 17:42.095
Guess who he beat that year?

17:42.129 --> 17:44.364
The great Marty Walsh?

17:44.397 --> 17:45.365
- Bingo.
- Wow.

17:45.398 --> 17:48.101
But apparently he was
an even better coach.

17:48.135 --> 17:49.869
Until he dropped out
for reasons unknown.

17:49.902 --> 17:54.507
They say he's the James Bond
version of Bela Karolyi .

17:54.541 --> 17:57.277
I'll never forget Karolyi
yelling at Kerri Strug:

17:57.310 --> 17:59.112
"You can do it!"

17:59.146 --> 18:00.413
When she had a broken ankle.

18:00.447 --> 18:03.516
Or James Bond skiing off the
cliff in The Spy Who Loved Me.

18:03.550 --> 18:06.553
I don't want that
to be our little girl.

18:06.586 --> 18:08.855
She's not all that little.

18:08.888 --> 18:12.492
Do you ever just wish
she was a normal teenager?

18:12.525 --> 18:14.327
I'm just going to be up front.

18:14.361 --> 18:17.230
I'm going to a high
school party tonight.

18:17.264 --> 18:20.133
Kaylie's driving and I'm not
drinking. But if she does...

18:20.167 --> 18:23.270
...I'll make sure I get
a designated driver to
bring us home.

18:23.303 --> 18:24.471
So...

18:24.504 --> 18:26.206
...can I go?

18:26.239 --> 18:28.275
- Yes.
- Yes.

18:28.308 --> 18:29.376
But be home by...

18:29.409 --> 18:30.343
- Eleven.
- Thirty.

18:30.377 --> 18:32.279
If you need us to come
get you just call...

18:32.312 --> 18:36.183
- I know the drill, dad.
- All right. Well, have fun.

18:36.216 --> 18:37.584
I doubt it.

18:39.586 --> 18:41.688
She's going to a party.

18:41.721 --> 18:44.157
Look at us. We're almost normal.

18:44.191 --> 18:45.525
- Hello.
- Yeah!

18:45.558 --> 18:46.559
- Ow! Shhh.
- Shhh.

18:49.396 --> 18:50.630
[knocking]

18:52.199 --> 18:54.434
I need refuge. My room's too
close to the living room and

18:54.467 --> 18:57.604
Dad's yelling at old footage
of himself playing baseball.

18:57.637 --> 18:59.306
OK, just, Close the door.

19:02.342 --> 19:03.676
OK. I have something to ask you

19:03.710 --> 19:06.446
but you gotta promise
not to say anything.

19:06.479 --> 19:08.715
How can I answer your question
if I promise not to say
anything?

19:08.748 --> 19:10.317
Ha, ha.

19:10.350 --> 19:11.518
You know what I mean.

19:11.551 --> 19:13.152
[Kaylie] All right...

19:15.455 --> 19:19.158
Is this the right outfit
to wear to a kegger?

19:23.630 --> 19:24.664
You're going to Blast Off?

19:24.697 --> 19:26.566
You know about Blast Off?

19:26.599 --> 19:28.635
It was a big deal
even way back in my day.

19:28.668 --> 19:30.637
Sweet.

19:31.538 --> 19:33.606
All right. What do you think?

19:33.640 --> 19:35.542
You look fine.

19:36.543 --> 19:37.710
Listen, I'm serious.

19:37.744 --> 19:39.946
Boys are after four things,
at a kegger:

19:39.979 --> 19:41.748
Brew and booty.

19:41.781 --> 19:44.584
Then more booty
and even more brew.

19:44.617 --> 19:46.286
And you deserve
better than that.

19:46.319 --> 19:47.620
Leo.

19:47.654 --> 19:49.589
I'm a world class athlete,

19:49.622 --> 19:51.591
I think I can handle
a few drunken boys.

19:51.624 --> 19:52.625
[sighs]

19:52.659 --> 19:54.627
[cell phone rings]

20:13.646 --> 20:16.416
Did you tell lover boy
you're going to a kegger?

20:16.449 --> 20:19.252
[sighs] I don't want
to hurt his feelings.

20:19.286 --> 20:21.654
And I just need a night
of no pressure. So...

20:21.688 --> 20:25.525
- He's pressuring you?
- No. No. Of course not.

20:25.558 --> 20:27.527
He's super supportive

20:27.560 --> 20:29.696
and totally understands
I'm not ready to have sex.

20:31.564 --> 20:32.632
Too much information?

20:34.701 --> 20:36.803
It's cool. Just because
I'm your brother doesn't mean

20:36.836 --> 20:39.038
we can't talk about...

20:39.071 --> 20:40.773
...these things.

20:40.807 --> 20:43.610
However, if he lays a hand
on you before you're ready,

20:43.643 --> 20:47.447
- I'll rip his heart out.
- Wow.

20:55.087 --> 20:56.289
Where's Mom?

20:56.323 --> 20:58.458
She went to take her stuff back.

21:00.760 --> 21:02.762
We have to be able to
pay the bills, Brian.

21:02.795 --> 21:05.698
Yeah, I know. It's OK.

21:11.338 --> 21:12.505
Why didn't she take
your movie back?

21:14.774 --> 21:17.810
She said it's been a long time
since she's had a decent job

21:17.844 --> 21:22.749
and she just wants to be able
to buy her kids something
special every now and then.

21:48.675 --> 21:50.543
- Hey.
- The phone's back on.

21:50.577 --> 21:53.380
Yeah, I know.
I paid the bill. In cash.

21:53.413 --> 21:55.448
Wow. Yay, Mom.

21:55.482 --> 21:56.849
Did your sister get back, yet?

21:56.883 --> 21:59.852
Yeah, she's been in the
bathroom for like, hours.

22:05.858 --> 22:09.696
- Honey, is everything OK?
- [Emily] Just a minute.

22:09.729 --> 22:12.699
Oh, my God.
Did you get your period?

22:12.732 --> 22:16.603
Mom, gymnasts don't get their
periods. Not enough body fat.

22:16.636 --> 22:18.805
But you never know.
She's a young woman.

22:18.838 --> 22:20.440
Honey?

22:26.946 --> 22:30.383
You look hot!

22:30.417 --> 22:31.418
Smokin' hot!

22:34.654 --> 22:37.957
- I'm going to a party.
- In the dress I bought you?

22:40.693 --> 22:41.928
Honey, give me a hug.

22:44.464 --> 22:46.533
I don't want you to feel
guilty about this dress, OK?

22:46.566 --> 22:47.667
You were right.

22:47.700 --> 22:50.670
I took back everything
that I bought myself

22:50.703 --> 22:52.439
and I paid the phone bill.

22:52.972 --> 22:54.674
That's great, Mom.

22:54.707 --> 22:56.543
Good for you.

22:56.576 --> 22:57.877
We're not gonna worry
about money anymore.

22:57.910 --> 22:59.846
This job is really
going to work out.

22:59.879 --> 23:01.681
OK?

23:01.714 --> 23:03.550
Can I please...

23:03.583 --> 23:05.718
...put some lip gloss on you?

23:07.620 --> 23:08.855
- OK.
- OK. OK. Hang on.

23:11.591 --> 23:12.892
Ready?

23:18.465 --> 23:19.566
Good job.

23:19.599 --> 23:21.668
You look beautiful.

23:21.701 --> 23:24.637
She's a chip off the old block.
What do you think, Brian?

23:24.671 --> 23:25.872
You two could be sisters.

23:25.905 --> 23:29.642
You know, that's what they say,
"Hey, is that your sister?"

23:29.676 --> 23:30.677
[chuckling]

23:30.710 --> 23:32.879
Now, I need to give you some
earrings. Hang on. OK?

23:36.816 --> 23:38.751
You just made her life.

23:41.754 --> 23:43.623
[rock music]

23:50.630 --> 23:52.732
OK, you look amazing.

23:52.765 --> 23:55.635
It's my mom's.
She made me wear it.

23:55.668 --> 23:57.670
At least you had something
other than a Rock sweatshirt.

23:58.938 --> 24:03.610
So what do we do now,
just stand here?

24:03.643 --> 24:04.611
[Kaylie] Uh...

24:04.644 --> 24:06.746
We get beer.

24:06.779 --> 24:08.748
- Right?
- Yeah.

24:08.781 --> 24:09.749
I'm not drinking.

24:09.782 --> 24:13.019
I think we're aware of
that, Payson. Thanks.

24:13.052 --> 24:14.754
Where's the keg?

24:14.787 --> 24:17.990
Probably at the end of that line
of people holding empty cups.

24:18.024 --> 24:19.759
No, I did not come
here to wait in line.

24:19.792 --> 24:21.528
Do you think there's
more than one keg?

24:22.795 --> 24:24.263
[Emily] Why don't you
guys look over there.

24:24.296 --> 24:25.998
- I'll wait in line here.
- Yeah. OK.

24:26.032 --> 24:28.735
Wait. Do you think it's
a good idea to split up?

24:28.768 --> 24:31.771
Don't worry, if you're
not back in ten minutes

24:31.804 --> 24:33.673
I'll call the National Guard.

24:35.307 --> 24:36.776
[Lauren] Daddy, this is perfect.

24:36.809 --> 24:38.911
This is one of the best
traditions we have.

24:38.945 --> 24:40.813
I love my birthday dinner.

24:40.847 --> 24:43.683
Oh, you can take away
this third place setting.

24:43.716 --> 24:44.917
It's just gonna be
the two of us.

24:44.951 --> 24:48.621
Actually, I invited
Summer to join us.

24:48.655 --> 24:52.024
- What?
- Honey, it's your birthday.

24:52.058 --> 24:54.927
You don't want to celebrate
with just your boring old dad.

24:54.961 --> 24:58.631
Besides, I'd really like
you to get to know Summer.

24:58.665 --> 25:00.600
What's to know?
She's your secretary.

25:00.633 --> 25:02.535
And she's practically my age.

25:02.569 --> 25:03.970
It's not like you're
going to marry her.

25:06.906 --> 25:09.008
- You're not going to marry her.
- No.

25:09.041 --> 25:11.678
I mean, we don't know
where it's going

25:11.711 --> 25:15.815
but she's a wonderful woman
and I enjoy her company.

25:16.983 --> 25:18.685
Look...

25:18.718 --> 25:21.954
I would really appreciate it
if you gave her a chance.

25:21.988 --> 25:25.825
Daddy, I don't believe you.
She totally has you fooled.

25:25.858 --> 25:28.695
What makes her different
than all the other women
you've blown through?

25:29.762 --> 25:31.598
She's just different.

25:31.631 --> 25:32.932
For one thing, she's smart.

25:32.965 --> 25:37.704
For another, her faith
is really important to her.

25:37.737 --> 25:38.605
Are you falling for that?

25:38.638 --> 25:40.807
How much of a Christian
could she be?

25:40.840 --> 25:43.342
I mean, Please. The woman
wears Dolce & Gabbana.

25:43.375 --> 25:46.545
And there she is. Be nice.

25:49.048 --> 25:50.750
Hi, honey. Thanks for coming.

25:54.921 --> 25:56.088

This is my friend Jasper.

Pizza Shack girl?

Ah... Not so much
friend as bandmate.

27:01.821 --> 27:03.389
- Bandmate?
- [man] Were you...

27:03.422 --> 27:05.191
...expecting the Jonas Brothers?

27:05.224 --> 27:08.060
Come on, who named the band?.

27:08.094 --> 27:10.763
- Brian or Mick?
- I have no idea.

27:10.797 --> 27:12.932
Those guys are like skeletons.

27:12.965 --> 27:14.934
I would like to introduce
you to somebody...

27:14.967 --> 27:18.671
- C'mon. Who named the band?
- I have no clue.

27:18.705 --> 27:19.772
Well then, cough it up.

Thank you.

she looks like a freak.

You look great.

27:31.818 --> 27:35.121

Exceptionally great.

27:36.088 --> 27:37.757

feel like a freak.

He really is a freak.

answer a simple trivia question.

Cheers, boys.

28:14.260 --> 28:17.897
Hey, wait. 1962.

28:17.930 --> 28:19.265
Brian Jones named the band

28:19.298 --> 28:22.134
after the Muddy Waters song,
"Rolling Stone".

28:22.168 --> 28:24.837
Ironic cause he named the band

28:24.871 --> 28:26.138
and taught Mick
how to play harmonica,

28:26.172 --> 28:30.009
but they had to kick him
out cause he was such an
arrogant ass.

28:30.042 --> 28:31.778
We have one of those too.

28:37.850 --> 28:39.752
I believe this
belongs to you.

28:43.856 --> 28:46.292
Wait. How could you
possibly know that?

28:46.325 --> 28:48.761
My mom has a thing
for musicians.

rock 'n roll trivia,

28:51.798 --> 28:54.133

Well... Like mother like
daughter, hopefully, right?

28:57.804 --> 29:01.941
- Just as friends.
- Yeah.

29:01.974 --> 29:04.944
So, are you here with somebody?

29:04.977 --> 29:06.245
Yeah.

29:07.246 --> 29:08.514
Where is he?

29:08.547 --> 29:10.082
No. I'm here
with some girls.

29:10.116 --> 29:12.051
Oh. Nice.

29:12.084 --> 29:13.786
Look, I know this sounds
kind of weird, but...

29:13.820 --> 29:15.922
They don't know I work
at the Shack, so...

29:15.955 --> 29:17.890
Yeah, I got you.

29:17.924 --> 29:21.961
You don't want them to know
you work in a place that
smells like pepperoni?

29:21.994 --> 29:24.163
No! That's not it. Not at all.

29:24.864 --> 29:26.833
Oh.

You don't want
them catching you

smells like pepperoni, huh?

29:31.603 --> 29:34.206
- Not at all.
- No, no...

29:34.240 --> 29:37.343
It's all good. I'm cool.

29:37.376 --> 29:38.811
Don't worry about it, Emily.

29:41.247 --> 29:42.949
I'll catch you later.

Happy birthday, Lauren.

29:53.993 --> 29:57.229
[sighs] It's beautiful.

29:57.263 --> 30:01.233
It really is, Steven.
Your father has such good taste.

30:01.267 --> 30:03.836
He bought me this
for my birthday.

30:03.870 --> 30:06.105
There you go.

30:06.138 --> 30:08.374
You really like it?

30:08.407 --> 30:10.609
I love it. Thank you, Daddy.

30:10.642 --> 30:13.880
Dad buys me a new charm
for my birthday every year.

30:13.913 --> 30:15.314
- Isn't that great?
- It is.

30:19.651 --> 30:22.955
You know, it's actually
appropriate that Summer is here.

30:22.989 --> 30:26.192
The whole charm bracelet idea
was hers in the first place.

30:26.225 --> 30:30.129
Talk about great taste.
She picked out all those charms.

30:35.434 --> 30:36.435
I'll be right back.

30:41.640 --> 30:44.343
I only helped him
pick them out really.

30:44.376 --> 30:47.947
He just needed a little feminine
guidance. You know how men are.

30:47.980 --> 30:49.882
So, let me get this straight.

30:49.916 --> 30:52.284
For the past few years,
all the special gifts
my father has given me

30:52.318 --> 30:53.852
have actually come from you?

30:55.021 --> 30:56.388
Well, he paid for them.

30:57.456 --> 31:00.226
Money's easy for my dad.
He's rich.

31:00.259 --> 31:01.427
But I don't have
to tell you that.

31:01.460 --> 31:04.163
I am not interested
in your father's money.

platinum goody-girl cross
around your neck

31:07.433 --> 31:09.135

You have ambition
written all over you.

more like the third wheel
than the birthday girl.

36:41.400 --> 36:42.668
"This is Emily Kmetko."

36:44.570 --> 36:45.804
Yeah.

36:46.705 --> 36:48.740
[Kaylie] I don't feel so good.

36:48.774 --> 36:51.310
Do not toss your cookies
in my car.

36:51.343 --> 36:53.979
And do not toss them on me!

36:54.012 --> 36:55.547
- What were you thinking?
- Don't...

36:55.581 --> 36:56.648
Don't lecture me.

36:56.682 --> 36:57.983
You're training for
the Olympics!

36:58.016 --> 37:00.786
La, la, la, la, la...

37:00.819 --> 37:02.654
So how many beers
did she have?

37:02.688 --> 37:04.556
I don't know.

37:04.590 --> 37:07.426
However many it takes for
a 90 pound girl to get drunk.

37:07.459 --> 37:08.727
So, one?

37:10.529 --> 37:13.265
- Definitely, at least two.
- Maybe even three.

37:13.299 --> 37:16.302
Oh man, she is gonna hurt
so bad in the morning.

37:16.335 --> 37:17.803
I'm glad you called me.
You did the right thing.

37:17.836 --> 37:20.439
It was Payson's idea.

37:21.440 --> 37:22.674
It was a good one.

37:22.708 --> 37:25.577
We'll drop you off
first, Payson.

37:28.580 --> 37:30.048
[slow rock music]

37:30.081 --> 37:32.751
- [indistinct shouting]
- [laughing]

37:37.589 --> 37:40.258
[man] Hey Maggie,
we'll see ya!

37:59.611 --> 38:02.648
Whoa! Yeah!

38:03.615 --> 38:04.583
[Lauren] Hey.

38:04.616 --> 38:06.485
What are you doing here?

38:08.119 --> 38:09.688
I could ask you the same.

38:10.656 --> 38:13.359
Do you mind if I sit down?

38:20.799 --> 38:24.870
So, you look like you
just lost your best friend.

38:24.903 --> 38:27.105
I guess you could say that.

38:27.138 --> 38:29.675
Yeah, I know the feeling.

38:29.708 --> 38:31.309
Kaylie and I used
to be best friends.

38:32.611 --> 38:33.912
Who's fault is that?

38:35.146 --> 38:36.548
Mine.

38:36.582 --> 38:37.649
I guess.

38:39.551 --> 38:41.753
But Kaylie wasn't there for me,
when the new girl showed up.

38:41.787 --> 38:43.121
She was just all about herself.

38:43.154 --> 38:45.524
Sounds like Kaylie.

38:46.592 --> 38:48.093
Yeah, well...

38:48.126 --> 38:49.661
You know rich girls.

38:50.796 --> 38:52.698
Aren't you rich?

38:52.731 --> 38:54.600
Yeah, but I'm not spoiled.

38:57.636 --> 38:59.638
OK. Maybe a little bit.

38:59.671 --> 39:01.840
[chuckles] OK.

39:01.873 --> 39:05.477
But, I don't blow off the
people I love when something
better comes along.

39:05.511 --> 39:08.614
- It's always about her.
- That's Kaylie.

39:08.647 --> 39:11.583
She's always got to have
everybody chasing after her.

39:11.617 --> 39:14.686
Screw her. Why are we
even talking about her?

39:15.921 --> 39:18.356
Why are we even
talking at all?

39:33.572 --> 39:37.676
So, that guy glaring at me when
I drove you away from the party.

39:37.709 --> 39:38.877
Is he your boyfriend?

39:38.910 --> 39:40.846
We're not allowed
to have boyfriends.

39:40.879 --> 39:42.581
You're not allowed
to go to keggers either.

39:42.614 --> 39:43.882
But, you don't strike me

39:43.915 --> 39:45.617
as a girl who's afraid
to break the rules.

39:47.185 --> 39:49.688
Well, sometimes you have
to break the rules.

39:49.721 --> 39:51.523
To survive.

39:53.525 --> 39:54.693
What?

39:54.726 --> 39:57.696
You're not like
most girls your age.

39:58.897 --> 40:01.199
It that a good thing
or a bad thing?

40:01.232 --> 40:03.902
Neither. It's just...

40:03.935 --> 40:05.504
You're interesting.

40:08.006 --> 40:09.475
Well...

40:09.508 --> 40:11.510
I'm walking you
to the door this time.

40:11.543 --> 40:12.978
No argument.

40:13.011 --> 40:15.747
What about her?

40:16.848 --> 40:18.550
Trust me. She won't miss us.

40:25.657 --> 40:27.759
See? That wasn't so horrible.

40:30.028 --> 40:30.996
Thanks for the ride.

40:31.029 --> 40:33.565
My pleasure. Again.

40:34.666 --> 40:36.535
Oh! I'm sorry.

40:36.568 --> 40:39.605
I didn't realize
anyone was out here.

40:39.638 --> 40:41.873
I was just on my way out
to get the paper.

40:41.907 --> 40:44.843
It's not morning yet,
and we don't get the paper.

40:44.876 --> 40:46.011
Oh, right.

40:46.044 --> 40:47.713
[laughing]

40:49.748 --> 40:51.750
I'm Emily's mom.

40:51.783 --> 40:53.619
We haven't officially met but...

40:53.652 --> 40:56.522
But since you've brought
my daughter home twice...

40:56.555 --> 40:57.723
It's nice to meet you,
Mrs. Kmetko.

40:57.756 --> 41:00.726
Oh please. Call me Chloe.

41:00.759 --> 41:02.661
Would you like to come in
for a cup of tea?

41:02.694 --> 41:04.029
No! He can't.

41:04.062 --> 41:05.931
Kaylie's in the car.

41:07.699 --> 41:09.768
Well, I don't see Kaylie.

41:09.801 --> 41:11.269
She's lying down.

41:11.302 --> 41:15.040
Oh! Well, then you should get
her home and get her to bed.

41:15.073 --> 41:17.609
- I will Mrs...
- Ah! Ah! Ah!

41:17.643 --> 41:18.777
- Chloe.
- Yes.

41:18.810 --> 41:20.045
Good night, Emily.

41:20.078 --> 41:21.913
Good night.

41:25.083 --> 41:26.618
Hmm!

41:26.652 --> 41:28.720
You know,
if you don't marry him I will.

41:30.556 --> 41:31.923
He's young enough
to be your son.

41:31.957 --> 41:33.692
He is not!

41:35.026 --> 41:36.928
Oh, honey. I was just kidding.

41:36.962 --> 41:39.064
Aw... Honey!

41:39.097 --> 41:41.299
[* Brett Dennen:
Follow Your Heart]

41:41.332 --> 41:42.701
[Kaylie] If Dad
finds out about tonight...

41:42.734 --> 41:44.670
...I'm dead.

41:44.703 --> 41:47.973
- He won't.
- What about my car?

41:48.006 --> 41:50.008
We'll get it tomorrow
before he notices it's gone.

41:50.041 --> 41:52.878
You're the best brother
in the world.

41:52.911 --> 41:57.583
And I don't deserve you
or Carter.

41:57.616 --> 41:59.751
You'll feel better
in the morning.

41:59.785 --> 42:00.952
No, I won't.

42:00.986 --> 42:02.520
Because...

42:04.122 --> 42:05.891
Carter came...

42:05.924 --> 42:07.693
...and we had...

42:07.726 --> 42:08.994
...we had a big fight.

42:11.597 --> 42:13.031
What am I going to do?

42:14.766 --> 42:15.934
Tell him you're sorry.

42:15.967 --> 42:18.770
In the morning you'll
kiss and make-up and...

42:18.804 --> 42:21.039
Are you sure?

42:21.072 --> 42:25.010
The guy is crazy about you.
I'm sure.

42:26.778 --> 42:29.748
Everything will be back
to the way it was tomorrow.

42:30.348 --> 42:31.883
Now go to sleep.

42:35.020 --> 42:38.123
* I've been a poor man

42:38.156 --> 42:40.859
* I've been a rich man

42:40.892 --> 42:46.798
* I made a fortune
And I paid the cost *

42:47.833 --> 42:50.869
* I've had some good friends

42:50.902 --> 42:54.039
* They come and go

42:54.072 --> 42:59.745
* Follow your heart
Follow your heart *

42:59.778 --> 43:01.346
[clears throat]

43:01.379 --> 43:02.681
So...

43:03.915 --> 43:05.150
So...

43:07.786 --> 43:08.787
You OK?

43:09.788 --> 43:12.624
Yeah, I'm fine. Of course.

43:13.759 --> 43:14.893
Do you need a ride home?

43:14.926 --> 43:16.695
I have my car.

43:19.898 --> 43:20.899
Cause...

43:20.932 --> 43:23.134
We have practice
in the morning.

43:23.168 --> 43:25.170
Tom... Tomorrow's Sunday, but...

43:25.203 --> 43:27.673
I get it if you have to go.

43:27.706 --> 43:28.840
I'm cool. I'm cool.

43:32.010 --> 43:32.978
You sure?

43:33.011 --> 43:34.212
Yeah. I'm fine.

43:36.114 --> 43:37.115
OK.

43:39.450 --> 43:42.187
* I've been cheated

43:42.220 --> 43:45.657
* I've been defeated

43:45.691 --> 43:50.929
* I played the game
And I've been double crossed *

* Every friend of mine

[door closes]

* Has been in hard times

* And you won't get lost

44:10.982 --> 44:16.955
* Follow your heart
Follow your heart *

44:16.988 --> 44:19.758
* Follow your heart

44:19.791 --> 44:23.795
* And you won't get lost
