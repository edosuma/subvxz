M_I_SForEver

05:16.751 --> 05:18.853
The bar is closed.

05:23.724 --> 05:27.061
I said, "The bar is closed."

05:30.798 --> 05:33.801
What's the matter, buddy?
You deaf or something?

05:39.640 --> 05:41.042
Whoa, whoa, whoa, wait!

05:41.075 --> 05:43.044
Paulie, Paulie, Paulie, hey!

05:43.077 --> 05:44.812
Whoo.

05:46.013 --> 05:48.415
Jesus Christ.

05:48.448 --> 05:50.618
Long time, no see, buddy.

05:50.651 --> 05:53.054
- How's it going?
- How's it going?

05:53.087 --> 05:54.956
I just about cracked open
your fucking skull.

05:54.989 --> 05:57.091
That's how it's going.

06:01.195 --> 06:03.496
Man...

06:03.531 --> 06:06.067
The place sure looks the same.

06:06.100 --> 06:09.770
And so do you
since the last time.

06:09.804 --> 06:12.006
Since you fucking disappeared?

06:14.041 --> 06:15.643
I didn't disappear.

06:15.676 --> 06:16.811
I went away for school.

06:16.844 --> 06:18.679
Oh, yeah, I heard about that.

06:18.713 --> 06:21.015
I also heard you flunked out
after the first semester.

06:21.048 --> 06:22.583
Yeah, so?

06:22.617 --> 06:25.553
So where you been since then,
college boy?

06:27.655 --> 06:29.456
Around.

06:29.489 --> 06:30.958
Doing what?

06:32.492 --> 06:33.594
Drifting.

06:33.628 --> 06:35.096
Drifting.

06:36.764 --> 06:38.165
Yeah, more or less.

06:38.199 --> 06:39.834
Drifting after what?

06:39.867 --> 06:41.869
Experience.

06:41.903 --> 06:43.537
Knowledge.

06:47.241 --> 06:49.110
- Inspiration.
- Hey!

06:49.143 --> 06:50.244
Did you grow up
in a fucking barn?

06:50.278 --> 06:53.014
I just finished wiping
the place down for fuck sakes!

06:53.047 --> 06:54.682
- Sorry.
- Just waltz in here

06:54.715 --> 06:56.083
like you own the place.

06:56.117 --> 06:58.519
Haven't changed a bit,
have you?

06:58.552 --> 07:00.788
- I hope not.
- You're still the same punk

07:00.821 --> 07:03.490
who used to run around town
with what's her face.

07:03.524 --> 07:06.160
- Lizzie.
- Who the fuck is Lizzie?

07:06.193 --> 07:07.561
What's her face.

07:07.595 --> 07:10.463
The girl I used to date
in high school.

07:10.497 --> 07:11.766
- Lizzie O'Connor?
- Jesus.

07:11.799 --> 07:13.701
Elizabeth O'Connor.

07:13.734 --> 07:15.069
And it ain't O'Connor anymore.

07:15.102 --> 07:16.537
It's Krasinski.

07:16.570 --> 07:18.039
She married some Polack.

07:18.072 --> 07:20.942
They went away
to Winnipeg last year.

07:29.917 --> 07:31.185
- So...
- So what?

07:31.218 --> 07:32.753
So why are you staring at me
like that?

07:32.787 --> 07:33.888
'Cause I'm trying to figure out

07:33.921 --> 07:35.189
what you're doing here, Steve,

07:35.222 --> 07:37.725
now out of the fucking blue

07:37.758 --> 07:40.561
when you couldn't even come
to the fucking funeral.

07:42.964 --> 07:45.666
You should be ashamed
of yourself.

07:48.836 --> 07:50.604
I get it. I get it.

07:50.638 --> 07:53.507
- You're surprised to see me.
- Surprised?

07:53.541 --> 07:54.976
That's fucking rich.

07:55.009 --> 07:56.577
And don't give me
that stupid look.

07:56.610 --> 07:58.145
Just because you've been
hiding for three years

07:58.179 --> 08:00.181
doesn't mean
I'd magically forget.

08:01.816 --> 08:03.184
Forget what?

08:03.217 --> 08:06.287
Don't play games with me, kid.

08:06.320 --> 08:09.090
I... I'm not playing games
with you.

08:09.123 --> 08:11.559
If you don't want my foot

08:11.592 --> 08:14.228
far, far, far
up your fucking ass,

08:14.261 --> 08:15.930
do not walk in here

08:15.963 --> 08:19.133
and start playing games
with me.

08:19.166 --> 08:20.534
Do I owe you?

08:21.902 --> 08:23.270
Do you owe me?

08:23.304 --> 08:25.840
Yeah, do I owe you?

08:25.873 --> 08:29.744
Jesus Christ,
are you fucking kidding me?

08:29.777 --> 08:30.578
Yeah, well...

08:30.611 --> 08:34.215
You're goddamn right
you owe me!

08:37.918 --> 08:41.822
Calm down. Of course,
of course I owe you.

08:41.856 --> 08:45.793
Man, you sh... you should see
the look on your face.

08:45.826 --> 08:48.629
"You're goddamn right
you owe me, hm!"

08:48.662 --> 08:51.098
Oh, you think this is all
pretty funny, eh?

08:53.634 --> 08:55.002
- Yeah.
- You ain't the only one

08:55.036 --> 08:57.238
with a sense of humor.

09:00.241 --> 09:03.911
- Hey, who are you calling?
- Shut up, I'm on the phone.

09:09.183 --> 09:10.651
Hey, it's me.

09:10.684 --> 09:11.585
Yeah, yeah, I know
what time it is.

09:11.619 --> 09:13.354
Sorry about that,
but just listen to this.

09:13.387 --> 09:15.589
I'm cleaning up the place,
I'm counting the money.

09:15.623 --> 09:18.225
Guess who walks
through the fucking door?

09:18.259 --> 09:19.760
Steve.

09:19.794 --> 09:20.961
Yeah, little Stevie shithead.

09:20.995 --> 09:21.962
Out of the blue
he comes in here

09:21.996 --> 09:25.232
acting like a big shot, so, uh,

09:25.266 --> 09:28.202
I thought you might like
to come down and say hi.

09:28.235 --> 09:29.070
I know it's snowing.

09:29.103 --> 09:29.904
What do you want me to do,
chain him

09:29.937 --> 09:31.872
to the fucking radiator
till tomorrow?

09:34.208 --> 09:35.176
Yeah. So you'll come?

09:36.877 --> 09:38.779
Great. An hour, good.

09:38.813 --> 09:41.048
Thanks. And, you know, sorry.

09:45.052 --> 09:47.621
Is that who I think it was?

09:51.225 --> 09:53.027
You know, I better get going.

09:53.060 --> 09:55.329
Oh, no, no, no, wait a minute,
wait a minute.

09:55.362 --> 09:57.865
Stevie, Stevie, have a seat.

09:59.834 --> 10:03.337
Don't you want to say hi
to your old buddy Stellie?

10:07.308 --> 10:09.877
Stellie's coming here?

10:09.910 --> 10:12.813
Mm-hm.

10:12.847 --> 10:16.283
- In this storm?
- Yep.

10:19.787 --> 10:22.156
You're bluffing.

10:22.189 --> 10:25.693
- Bluffing?
- Yeah, I...

10:25.726 --> 10:28.362
I don't think
you even called him.

10:31.165 --> 10:33.868
Oh.

10:33.901 --> 10:35.803
You think you're pretty smart,
don't you, college boy?

10:35.836 --> 10:37.071
You think you're gonna
actually talk your way

10:37.104 --> 10:38.005
out of this one, right?

10:38.038 --> 10:39.773
Well, listen to me.

10:39.807 --> 10:40.774
The only reason I haven't

10:40.808 --> 10:42.076
personally busted your kneecaps

10:42.109 --> 10:43.244
is out of respect
for your old man,

10:43.277 --> 10:45.412
God rest his soul, but Stellie
doesn't give two shits

10:45.446 --> 10:47.948
about your old man
or you or me or anybody,

10:47.982 --> 10:50.251
and if he doesn't get
his fucking money,

10:50.284 --> 10:52.052
he's gonna take
one of his smokes

10:52.086 --> 10:55.456
and he's gonna put it out
in your fucking eyeball.

10:58.792 --> 11:02.163
- Where are you going?
- To get what you came here for.

12:31.151 --> 12:33.153
Recognize this?

12:33.187 --> 12:36.123
Of course I recognize this.

12:36.156 --> 12:38.926
He wouldn't go fishing
without it.

12:41.061 --> 12:45.466
But I... I came back for my dad,
not his tackle box.

12:49.003 --> 12:51.038
- Oh, Paul.
- Hey, I couldn't afford

12:51.071 --> 12:53.541
a proper urn because I had
to pay for the funeral

12:53.575 --> 12:55.309
and the cremation.

13:00.314 --> 13:02.584
- Come on, give him to me.
- Why?

13:02.617 --> 13:03.817
Because he would've
wanted me to have it.

13:03.851 --> 13:06.987
Said the guy who couldn't
show his face at the funeral.

13:07.021 --> 13:09.490
Guess you were too busy
drifting, eh?

13:09.524 --> 13:12.026
Me? I'm scraping together
money for flowers

13:12.059 --> 13:13.227
and a funeral parlor.

13:13.260 --> 13:15.563
I even put a collection jar
at the end of the bar there

13:15.597 --> 13:18.065
for a coffin because I didn't...

13:18.098 --> 13:20.267
because I didn't want
your old man to be cremated

13:20.301 --> 13:21.935
in a fucking cardboard box.

13:21.969 --> 13:23.237
You know, I would've been there
if I could.

13:23.270 --> 13:25.072
Well, you weren't. I was.

13:25.105 --> 13:27.308
I saw them roll the casket
into the furnace.

13:27.341 --> 13:28.610
I saw my friend burn.

13:28.643 --> 13:30.978
Why? Because I thought
it was important

13:31.011 --> 13:34.214
that somebody should be there
when it happened.

13:34.248 --> 13:37.351
So, no, I am not surprised
to see you, Stevie,

13:37.384 --> 13:39.987
'cause I knew one day you'd
come crawling back in here

13:40.020 --> 13:42.156
to collect these
and the rest of his home

13:42.189 --> 13:44.358
that's boxed up in my basement,
by the way.

13:44.391 --> 13:48.329
But don't think that
I'm handing over a goddamn thing

13:48.362 --> 13:50.431
until you reach
into your pocket

13:50.464 --> 13:53.334
and start settling up
what you owe me.

13:56.571 --> 13:59.607
That's not the only reason
I'm back.

13:59.641 --> 14:02.544
Hey, where the fuck
do you think you're going?

14:04.546 --> 14:06.581
I got something for you, too.

14:06.614 --> 14:09.149
Oh, yeah?

14:09.183 --> 14:11.185
How much you got?

14:13.354 --> 14:15.222
I've got something
better than cash.

14:15.255 --> 14:17.358
- Better than cash?
- Yeah.

14:17.391 --> 14:20.394
Oh, so guns, drugs, booze?

14:22.930 --> 14:25.165
I've got a story.

14:29.103 --> 14:31.205
Story?

14:31.238 --> 14:32.473
Yeah.

14:33.974 --> 14:36.377
I don't want a fucking story.

14:36.410 --> 14:37.978
- Why not?
- 'Cause a story

14:38.011 --> 14:39.547
has got no value.

14:39.581 --> 14:41.348
You see this watch?

14:41.382 --> 14:43.183
This watch has value.

14:43.217 --> 14:45.452
You see... you see these smokes?

14:45.486 --> 14:47.622
These smokes have value.

14:47.655 --> 14:52.527
This bar and everything in it,
it all has value.

14:52.560 --> 14:54.428
Except that fridge,
it's fucking busted.

14:54.461 --> 14:56.163
- So?
- So,

14:56.196 --> 14:58.232
you think I can pay
Old Man McCauley a visit,

14:58.265 --> 15:00.200
pick out a nice new icebox
and pay for it

15:00.234 --> 15:01.703
with a goddamn story?

15:01.736 --> 15:03.270
What does this have to...

15:03.303 --> 15:05.205
It's a simple question, Steve.

15:05.239 --> 15:06.473
I don't understand.

15:06.508 --> 15:08.643
Can I pay for a fridge
with a story?

15:08.676 --> 15:09.943
What does this have to do
with anything?

15:09.977 --> 15:12.446
- Yes or no?
- Probably not.

15:12.479 --> 15:14.616
Probably fucking no way, right?

15:16.083 --> 15:17.719
Right.

15:17.752 --> 15:19.286
So what the fuck
makes you think

15:19.319 --> 15:20.655
you can come back here
and settle up

15:20.688 --> 15:22.089
with a goddamn story?

15:22.122 --> 15:23.490
Jesus Christ.

15:25.025 --> 15:27.161
You know, your old man,
he used to say

15:27.194 --> 15:29.963
you'd never amount
to a hill of shit.

15:29.997 --> 15:33.267
And I'm sorry to tell you, kid.

15:33.300 --> 15:35.235
He was right.

15:47.181 --> 15:49.216
What the fuck is that?

15:49.249 --> 15:51.985
- It's a coaster.
- Is it?

15:52.019 --> 15:55.222
Are you sure
it's not a fucking Skidoo?

15:55.255 --> 15:57.291
- Go ahead.
- What?

15:57.324 --> 15:59.226
Take a look.

16:07.234 --> 16:10.772
The Oak Room. And...

16:10.805 --> 16:13.240
It's a bar in Elk Lake.

16:13.273 --> 16:14.776
I know that.

16:14.809 --> 16:16.310
Who gives a shit?

16:16.343 --> 16:19.379
Well, I was there
this weekend.

16:19.413 --> 16:21.315
Once more for the cheap seats.

16:21.348 --> 16:22.416
Who gives a shit?

16:22.449 --> 16:24.619
- You should.
- Why is that?

16:24.652 --> 16:27.087
Because...

16:27.120 --> 16:31.526
You're never gonna believe
what happened at The Oak Room.

16:40.835 --> 16:43.270
Can I at least tell you
what happened?

16:43.303 --> 16:44.471
No.

16:44.506 --> 16:47.509
I... I can just talk
as you clean.

16:47.542 --> 16:49.376
You're pushing it, kid.

16:49.409 --> 16:52.747
You know, I can just sit here
and ramble on,

16:52.780 --> 16:55.583
- and you go about your...
- Hey!

16:55.617 --> 16:58.553
I don't want

16:58.586 --> 17:01.756
to hear it.

17:01.789 --> 17:04.191
- But...
- But what?

17:04.223 --> 17:07.595
I think you're gonna want
to hear what I have to say.

17:09.096 --> 17:11.231
- Why?
- Because

17:11.265 --> 17:15.603
a story is worth
a thousand words.

17:17.104 --> 17:21.074
A story is worth
a thousand words?

17:28.516 --> 17:30.852
You know what?

17:30.885 --> 17:32.085
It's almost midnight.

17:32.119 --> 17:33.621
Stellie is gonna be here
in an hour.

17:33.655 --> 17:35.289
One way or another,
you're gonna pay up tonight.

17:35.322 --> 17:39.827
So, in the meantime,
if you want to entertain me,

17:39.861 --> 17:41.829
tell your little story.

17:43.263 --> 17:44.766
Knock yourself out.

17:44.799 --> 17:48.770
Okay, well, The... The Oak Room,

17:48.803 --> 17:52.574
um, have... have you
been there before?

17:52.607 --> 17:54.509
- To The Oak Room?
- Yeah.

17:54.542 --> 17:56.644
- In Oak Lake?
- Yeah.

17:56.678 --> 17:58.646
What the fuck
would I be doing there?

17:58.680 --> 18:00.682
Well, uh,

18:00.715 --> 18:04.886
the story I'm about to tell you
happened a week ago,

18:04.919 --> 18:08.590
Saturday night
in the big storm,

18:08.623 --> 18:12.426
kind of like the one
raging outside.

18:17.264 --> 18:19.601
The guy behind the bar,
he was cleaning up,

18:19.634 --> 18:21.636
about to... about to close up
and...

18:21.669 --> 18:22.870
Jesus, you know what?

18:22.904 --> 18:24.639
This is starting
to sound familiar.

18:24.672 --> 18:25.907
Let me guess.

18:25.940 --> 18:29.777
All of a sudden, some jerk-off
comes through the fucking door

18:29.811 --> 18:31.813
and everything goes to shit.

18:31.846 --> 18:33.715
Exactly.

19:07.314 --> 19:09.249
The bar is closed.

19:11.953 --> 19:13.621
I said the... I said we're cl...

19:16.824 --> 19:18.660
You can wait.

19:37.244 --> 19:40.682
Uh, is, uh...

19:40.715 --> 19:41.883
...everything okay?

19:41.916 --> 19:43.417
Yeah.

19:43.450 --> 19:44.719
I just need to warm up.

19:44.752 --> 19:47.387
Well, like I said,
we're closed, so, uh...

19:47.421 --> 19:50.457
Yeah, is that what you call
small town hospitality?

19:50.490 --> 19:52.994
Look, I don't want
any trouble, so...

19:53.027 --> 19:55.596
Nobody said anything
about trouble.

19:55.630 --> 19:59.534
Fuck. I don't suppose
you got a charger?

19:59.567 --> 20:00.434
No.

20:01.903 --> 20:03.771
Then how about a drink?

20:03.805 --> 20:05.940
Um...

20:05.973 --> 20:07.240
Come on.

20:07.274 --> 20:08.876
Look, it's been a long day.

20:08.910 --> 20:12.446
Please, man,
I'm practically hypothermic.

20:15.883 --> 20:19.486
Yeah, all right. What...

20:19.520 --> 20:21.923
- What do you want?
- Brandy. That brandy?

20:23.423 --> 20:25.492
Yeah, uh...

20:35.703 --> 20:37.538
There you go.

20:39.372 --> 20:40.541
Your first day on the job?

20:43.443 --> 20:46.748
Usually, when you pour
someone a brandy,

20:46.781 --> 20:48.950
you put it in a snifter.

20:48.983 --> 20:52.019
You... you complaining
about a free drink?

20:52.053 --> 20:54.555
- Free?
- Yeah.

20:54.589 --> 20:59.326
This is what I call
small town hospitality.

21:01.394 --> 21:04.532
- Well, then, cheers.
- Mm-hm.

21:07.602 --> 21:09.871
Mm.

21:09.904 --> 21:12.607
So, is that gonna be enough
to get you home?

21:12.640 --> 21:14.075
Not hardly.

21:14.108 --> 21:16.443
Excuse me?

21:16.476 --> 21:18.746
I'm a long way from home.

21:18.780 --> 21:22.415
Yeah, okay,
so, uh, what's the game then?

21:22.449 --> 21:25.853
No games, but I am gonna need
to use that telephone

21:25.887 --> 21:29.090
if it's not too much trouble.

21:29.123 --> 21:32.325
No luck there
because, uh, the storm,

21:32.359 --> 21:33.493
it knocked out the phone lines.

21:33.528 --> 21:35.495
It won't be back on till,

21:35.530 --> 21:37.765
I don't know, maybe tomorrow.

21:37.799 --> 21:38.966
But you still have electricity.

21:39.000 --> 21:41.068
Yeah, for now.

21:42.703 --> 21:44.005
Fuck.

21:44.038 --> 21:45.807
You're not from around here,
are ya?

21:45.840 --> 21:48.609
- No.
- Yeah, so, uh...

21:49.877 --> 21:50.945
What are you doing here?

21:56.951 --> 21:59.854
- Passing through.
- Well,

21:59.887 --> 22:03.456
maybe you should
just keep on passing.

22:03.490 --> 22:07.494
Wow. There you go
with that hospitality again.

22:07.528 --> 22:10.497
I don't want any trouble,
all right?

22:10.531 --> 22:13.000
- You already said that.
- And...

22:14.735 --> 22:18.539
And once I'm warm,
I'll be on my way.

22:21.876 --> 22:24.444
Well, are you warmed up yet?

22:24.477 --> 22:27.380
Look, I just walked

22:27.414 --> 22:29.584
two miles through a blizzard.

22:29.617 --> 22:31.719
My face is frozen,
I lost my glasses,

22:31.752 --> 22:35.455
I can't feel my feet,
any part of them.

22:35.488 --> 22:36.858
From the ankles down,

22:36.891 --> 22:39.861
it feels like there is
nothing fucking there!

22:39.894 --> 22:41.095
Hey, all right, all right.

22:41.128 --> 22:43.531
I'm...

22:43.564 --> 22:45.432
I'm sure it's because your feet

22:45.465 --> 22:47.400
are probably soaking wet.

22:47.434 --> 22:49.103
You know what, just...

22:49.136 --> 22:52.573
Why don't you take off
your shoes and socks

22:52.607 --> 22:55.610
and, here, wrap 'em in this.

23:06.520 --> 23:07.487
Thank you.

23:09.590 --> 23:12.960
Your second problem is, well,

23:12.994 --> 23:14.528
you didn't dress
for the weather, did ya?

23:14.562 --> 23:15.796
Yeah, no shit.

23:30.645 --> 23:32.647
Where'd you say you were from?

23:34.181 --> 23:35.516
I didn't.

23:35.549 --> 23:36.984
Hm.

23:42.523 --> 23:43.958
Do you mind?

23:43.991 --> 23:45.927
What?

23:45.960 --> 23:47.695
Looking at me like that.

23:47.728 --> 23:48.796
Like what?

23:48.829 --> 23:50.831
Like I'm guilty of something.

23:50.865 --> 23:53.668
Are you guilty of something?

23:53.701 --> 23:54.936
Yeah.

23:54.969 --> 23:56.604
Driving north
without winter tires.

23:56.637 --> 24:00.174
So, you are driving north.

24:00.207 --> 24:01.142
Hm.

24:04.979 --> 24:07.748
Ah, if you're not
gonna talk, buddy,

24:07.782 --> 24:10.084
do you mind if I do
a little thinking out loud

24:10.117 --> 24:12.119
for the two of us?

24:15.656 --> 24:17.258
Okay.

24:17.291 --> 24:21.562
So let's say
that you are driving north

24:21.595 --> 24:23.764
and your car breaks down.

24:23.798 --> 24:26.133
But if that's the case,
why didn't you stop

24:26.167 --> 24:28.135
at the gas station
just off the highway

24:28.169 --> 24:30.037
and not here?

24:30.071 --> 24:33.541
And, yet, here you are
checking your phone,

24:33.574 --> 24:35.843
showing me that it's dead,
like that wouldn't have been

24:35.876 --> 24:38.679
the first thing that you did
when your car broke down?

24:40.247 --> 24:43.617
You're complaining
about your feet and the cold

24:43.651 --> 24:46.053
and the fact that you aren't
dressed for the weather,

24:46.087 --> 24:50.691
but not once, not once
have you mentioned the fact

24:50.725 --> 24:53.627
that your hand is bleeding.

24:53.661 --> 24:56.163
I mean, that's just...

24:56.197 --> 24:57.631
That's a little suspicious.

24:59.734 --> 25:01.202
Well, believe me,

25:01.235 --> 25:05.106
nothing that's happened tonight
has been suspicious.

25:10.911 --> 25:12.913
Okay.

25:12.947 --> 25:14.749
Sure.

25:26.627 --> 25:28.162
No hard feelings, buddy.

25:28.195 --> 25:32.566
Just... just trying to make
conversation with ya.

25:32.600 --> 25:33.834
I'm not here for conversation.

25:33.868 --> 25:37.338
Yeah, I know,
that's exactly my point.

25:37.371 --> 25:41.609
Okay, look,
I appreciate the fact

25:41.642 --> 25:43.344
that you let me
into your establishment,

25:43.377 --> 25:46.881
thus saving me
from the unfavorable task

25:46.914 --> 25:49.050
of, you know, freezing to death
in a snowbank

25:49.083 --> 25:50.985
in the middle
of buttfuck nowhere.

25:51.018 --> 25:54.688
Now just because you are doing
the absolute bare minimum

25:54.722 --> 25:56.590
that any halfway decent
human being

25:56.624 --> 25:59.026
in your position would do,
that does not obligate me

25:59.060 --> 26:01.595
to confess the world.

26:01.629 --> 26:02.531
Now trekking through the snow

26:02.563 --> 26:04.965
has been the least
of my problems today,

26:04.999 --> 26:07.802
so until I leave,
which will be soon,

26:07.835 --> 26:08.903
you'll have to excuse me

26:08.936 --> 26:10.371
if I am not dancing on rainbows

26:10.404 --> 26:13.274
and shitting ice cream.

26:15.342 --> 26:17.678
Well, suit yourself.

26:17.711 --> 26:20.281
Thank you very much,
I think I will.

26:51.378 --> 26:53.747
Ahh.

26:57.384 --> 27:00.387
What if I like to talk?

27:03.958 --> 27:05.426
You just said you wanted to go.

27:05.459 --> 27:07.394
- Yeah.
- But, now, you want to talk.

27:07.428 --> 27:09.196
Yeah, that's right.

27:09.230 --> 27:11.799
Okay. What's that about?

27:11.832 --> 27:14.101
Well, I guess
I just changed my mind.

27:16.370 --> 27:19.406
Anyway, do you know
bartenders love to talk?

27:19.440 --> 27:20.774
Wrong.

27:20.808 --> 27:22.309
Bartenders listen.

27:22.343 --> 27:25.112
It's the alcoholics
that never shut the fuck up.

27:25.146 --> 27:26.981
That much you should know.

27:39.994 --> 27:44.198
Fatto a Mano in Italia.

27:44.231 --> 27:46.800
Congratulations, you can read.

27:48.235 --> 27:49.703
What, are you Mafioso?

27:56.043 --> 27:56.877
Well, whatever you are,

27:56.911 --> 27:59.213
you certainly do not
let the weather

27:59.246 --> 28:03.250
get in the way
of dressing to the nines.

28:03.284 --> 28:05.886
I'm sorry, I'm only laughing
because that storm out there,

28:05.920 --> 28:07.454
you know, the one
that you walked through

28:07.488 --> 28:10.991
in these silly shoes,
it ain't so bad.

28:11.025 --> 28:13.727
I mean, the snow is coming down
pretty hard,

28:13.761 --> 28:16.497
but it's barely below zero.

28:16.531 --> 28:20.100
I mean, look at it out there.

28:20.134 --> 28:22.903
It's gorgeous.

28:26.073 --> 28:29.376
It's like a goddamn movie
or something.

28:31.946 --> 28:33.914
But...

28:33.948 --> 28:35.382
I mean, if you want to hear
about the cold,

28:35.416 --> 28:38.953
well, I can tell ya
about the cold.

28:38.986 --> 28:41.021
You see, I'm not
from around here.

28:41.055 --> 28:43.757
I grew up on a pig farm
just outside of Belleville

28:43.791 --> 28:45.092
and, you know, back then,

28:45.125 --> 28:46.961
we lived pretty close
to the lake.

28:46.994 --> 28:48.530
So in the wintertime,
we'd get some

28:48.563 --> 28:50.464
pretty serious wind chill.

28:50.497 --> 28:52.800
Ice storms too.

28:54.001 --> 28:56.003
And there was this one time
that I'll never forget.

28:56.036 --> 28:59.873
It was a night in January
and, you know,

28:59.907 --> 29:01.408
I can't even tell you
what time it was

29:01.442 --> 29:05.513
because I was sound asleep.

29:05.547 --> 29:07.881
You know,
off in dreamland when...

29:07.915 --> 29:09.917
when, all of a sudden,
my dad burst in my room

29:09.950 --> 29:12.453
and wakes me up.

29:12.486 --> 29:15.089
Now I can see he is in a panic.

29:18.959 --> 29:22.196
It was actually kind of scary
'cause I had never seen my dad

29:22.229 --> 29:25.065
so worked up before.

29:25.099 --> 29:26.900
But without explaining anything,

29:26.934 --> 29:28.969
he just told me
to get my ass out of bed

29:29.003 --> 29:31.272
and come help him in the barn,
and then just like that...

29:33.874 --> 29:35.276
...he's gone.

29:36.544 --> 29:37.978
You know, as for me,

29:38.012 --> 29:40.347
I'm still a little dazed
and half asleep,

29:40.381 --> 29:42.016
and I didn't know
what to think,

29:42.049 --> 29:45.919
but I could tell just
from the tone of his voice

29:45.953 --> 29:47.254
that it was something serious.

29:47.288 --> 29:50.024
So I got out of bed,
I threw on my boots,

29:50.057 --> 29:53.894
and I ran off to join him
wearing nothing but my PJs.

30:09.310 --> 30:11.546
That's when I started to worry.

30:11.579 --> 30:15.382
You see, we were poor.

30:15.416 --> 30:17.384
Dirt poor.

30:17.418 --> 30:20.254
We didn't have that many pigs,
and the ones that we did have,

30:20.287 --> 30:23.190
we relied on for the money.

30:23.223 --> 30:25.859
And we had
this one pregnant sow

30:25.893 --> 30:27.928
and she was sick.

30:27.961 --> 30:29.897
Long overdue.

30:29.930 --> 30:34.068
And my dad was just terrified
that her or her litter

30:34.101 --> 30:37.905
were not gonna make it
through the pregnancy.

30:40.074 --> 30:43.143
And as I got to the barn,
I could hear her squealing.

30:43.177 --> 30:46.180
She was in labor,
and my dad, he was just...

30:47.582 --> 30:50.585
He was just trying
to help her along.

30:57.157 --> 30:58.526
Didn't think there was
anything I could do,

30:58.560 --> 31:01.028
but then, my dad,
he turned to me

31:01.061 --> 31:05.366
and he handed me this...
this steel flashlight.

31:05.399 --> 31:07.901
It felt like a block of ice.

31:07.935 --> 31:10.638
He told me
just to... to hold it steady.

31:10.672 --> 31:15.075
That's all I had to do,
just hold it steady.

31:15.109 --> 31:18.445
The only problem was that
I had left the barn door open

31:18.479 --> 31:20.047
and now there was a wind
coming through

31:20.080 --> 31:22.684
like you wouldn't believe,
and here I was

31:22.717 --> 31:25.452
just trying to hold
this flashlight steady,

31:25.486 --> 31:30.324
but when the wind
cut through my pajamas...

31:30.357 --> 31:34.629
I could not stop myself
from shaking like a leaf.

31:36.497 --> 31:39.199
Like I felt like crying out
and running back to my house,

31:39.233 --> 31:42.002
but I couldn't, I just...

31:44.238 --> 31:47.941
And that's when I saw
my dad's watch.

31:47.975 --> 31:49.544
I was just sitting there,

31:49.577 --> 31:53.013
and I focused in on the sound.

31:53.046 --> 31:56.049
I mean, at first,
it was so faint,

31:56.083 --> 31:58.085
but then it became
the only thing I could hear.

32:00.421 --> 32:03.290
It was actually
kind of soothing.

32:03.323 --> 32:05.727
I zoned in on that sound

32:05.760 --> 32:09.463
and I pushed everything
out of my head.

32:12.433 --> 32:16.036
It must have worked
because, well,

32:16.069 --> 32:17.672
I made it through the night.

32:17.705 --> 32:22.109
And the cold, well,
it's never bothered me since.

32:38.225 --> 32:41.696
Oh, I'm sorry,
have I bored you?

32:45.132 --> 32:48.235
It must be hard for you
to relate to a story like that,

32:48.268 --> 32:50.705
the way you dress.

32:52.239 --> 32:55.108
Yeah, I bet you live in
a climate-controlled

32:55.142 --> 32:59.079
concrete and glass box
40 floors up.

32:59.112 --> 33:01.348
The only reason
you wear those stupid shoes

33:01.381 --> 33:03.518
is because you never
set foot outside.

33:03.551 --> 33:07.120
It's just end of the elevator,
down into the parking garage,

33:07.154 --> 33:11.726
into your expensive car
so you can zip across town

33:11.759 --> 33:15.062
into another parking garage
and up another elevator

33:15.095 --> 33:17.599
and on, and on, and on.

33:19.199 --> 33:22.035
I mean, is that about right?

33:47.529 --> 33:51.164
Kiss my ass,
you self-righteous country fuck.

33:52.366 --> 33:53.635
"Kiss my ass,

33:53.668 --> 33:56.504
you self-righteous
country fuck"?

33:56.538 --> 34:00.508
Oh, Jesus,
I got to remember that one.

34:00.542 --> 34:02.844
Okay, then what happened?

34:02.877 --> 34:05.780
- What do you mean?
- What happened next?

34:05.813 --> 34:08.114
Oh, well, that's...
it's not really important

34:08.148 --> 34:09.516
- what happens next.
- Not important?

34:09.551 --> 34:11.251
What are you talking about?

34:11.284 --> 34:14.187
Well, that's more or less
the end of the story.

34:14.221 --> 34:16.489
That's it?
That's the end of the story?

34:16.524 --> 34:18.292
- More or less.
- Guy walks into a bar,

34:18.324 --> 34:19.226
talks shit for ten minutes,

34:19.259 --> 34:20.293
and that's it,
that's your story?

34:20.327 --> 34:22.630
That kind of shit happens here
every goddamn day.

34:22.664 --> 34:23.764
What the fuck
makes that a story?

34:23.797 --> 34:25.667
- Well, there's more...
- No offense, college boy,

34:25.699 --> 34:26.668
but that's got to be just about

34:26.701 --> 34:29.202
the dumbest fucking story
I've ever heard.

34:29.235 --> 34:31.271
Well, that's because
you've only heard

34:31.304 --> 34:32.639
the end of the story.

34:32.674 --> 34:34.609
I haven't told you
the beginning.

34:34.641 --> 34:36.143
- The beginning?
- Yeah.

34:36.176 --> 34:38.312
Oh, fuck me,
this just gets worse.

34:38.344 --> 34:39.478
- What?
- You're telling me

34:39.514 --> 34:40.547
the story backwards?

34:40.581 --> 34:41.516
If I'm this bored
by the ending,

34:41.549 --> 34:43.350
why am I gonna bother
with the beginning?

34:43.382 --> 34:44.851
Yeah, well, the ending
only makes sense

34:44.886 --> 34:45.786
once you've heard
the beginning.

34:45.820 --> 34:47.387
Yeah, that's exactly why
you should have

34:47.420 --> 34:49.222
started there
in the first place.

34:49.255 --> 34:50.757
It's embarrassing that
I have to explain this to you.

34:50.792 --> 34:52.860
I didn't even finish
fucking high school.

34:52.893 --> 34:55.495
- Where are you going?
- I'm stretching my legs.

34:55.530 --> 34:58.733
The fucking story
put them to sleep.

35:07.942 --> 35:11.244
Well, can I continue?

35:11.278 --> 35:14.582
You can only continue
if you goose the truth a bit.

35:15.717 --> 35:18.185
- What?
- Goose the truth.

35:18.218 --> 35:20.622
The only reason your story
is boring the shit out of me

35:20.655 --> 35:23.825
is that you're telling it like
you're giving sworn testimony

35:23.858 --> 35:25.392
on the goddamn witness stand.

35:25.425 --> 35:26.293
You want to keep my attention,

35:26.326 --> 35:28.295
you've got to skip over
the boring shit,

35:28.328 --> 35:29.931
you've got to pump up
the action,

35:29.964 --> 35:32.700
you've got to give me
some meat to chew on.

35:32.734 --> 35:34.802
What makes you such an expert?

35:34.836 --> 35:37.204
Because I'm a bartender
with a big mouth

35:37.237 --> 35:38.606
and I know how to tell
a good story,

35:38.640 --> 35:40.575
and goosing the truth
is the way to do that.

35:40.608 --> 35:43.343
Your old man knew that.

35:43.377 --> 35:45.580
Old man, pfft.

35:57.257 --> 36:00.460
He ever take you ice fishing?

36:00.494 --> 36:03.564
A couple times.

36:03.598 --> 36:06.366
It figures.

36:06.400 --> 36:08.703
Hell of a fisherman, wasn't he?

36:08.736 --> 36:11.271
What's the name of that place
he liked?

36:11.304 --> 36:14.976
- Gray Owl.
- Gray Owl, yeah.

36:15.009 --> 36:16.711
Yeah, I went with him
a couple of times.

36:16.744 --> 36:19.346
It was pretty good.

36:19.379 --> 36:20.815
Myself, I prefer Turtle Lake.

36:20.848 --> 36:22.884
I mean, I got spots up there,
the fish, whoosh,

36:22.917 --> 36:26.921
they just jump
right into the boat.

36:26.954 --> 36:28.856
Did your dad ever tell you
about that crazy day

36:28.890 --> 36:30.992
I had up there?

36:31.025 --> 36:32.894
I don't think so.

36:35.863 --> 36:38.398
Must have been
about ten years ago.

36:38.432 --> 36:41.002
I had perfect conditions, right?

36:41.035 --> 36:45.006
I'm the only one on the lake.

36:45.039 --> 36:46.273
I'd gone the whole day

36:46.306 --> 36:47.675
without a single bite, not one,

36:47.709 --> 36:49.276
and I'm there for hours, right,

36:49.309 --> 36:50.745
with nothing
but a flask of whiskey

36:50.778 --> 36:52.245
in my pocket to keep me warm.

36:52.279 --> 36:55.382
Anyway, it gets to the point,

36:55.415 --> 36:58.553
pfft, I'm ready to go home.

36:58.586 --> 37:01.756
At the last second, I think,

37:01.789 --> 37:05.593
"I'm gonna drop one more line."

37:05.626 --> 37:07.662
So I drop it,

37:07.695 --> 37:09.797
and I wait a second.

37:12.600 --> 37:14.769
And I hook something,
something strong.

37:14.802 --> 37:16.403
I mean, I don't know
what it is,

37:16.436 --> 37:18.506
but I figure it must be
pretty fucking huge

37:18.539 --> 37:19.640
'cause this thing
is putting up

37:19.674 --> 37:20.942
one hell of a fight.

37:20.975 --> 37:22.543
I mean, it's a battle,
all right?

37:22.577 --> 37:24.444
And it goes on, and on, and on.

37:24.478 --> 37:25.913
And I'm fighting it,
and I'm fighting it,

37:25.947 --> 37:28.883
I'm fighting it,
and the sun is going down,

37:28.916 --> 37:30.918
and the wind is coming up,
and I'm fighting it,

37:30.952 --> 37:34.822
and I finally haul
this bastard in.

37:34.856 --> 37:36.891
It's nothing
but a little walleye.

37:36.924 --> 37:38.526
I can't fucking believe it.

37:38.559 --> 37:39.761
No more than five pounds.

37:39.794 --> 37:42.630
This thing fought
like a monster.

37:42.663 --> 37:44.297
Anyway, who cares?

37:44.331 --> 37:46.433
I got something for dinner
that night, right?

37:46.466 --> 37:48.970
So, I lay it down
in the bottom of the boat

37:49.003 --> 37:50.805
'cause I'm gonna clean
the little bastard right there.

37:50.838 --> 37:52.540
I'm still so fucking pissed off.

37:52.573 --> 37:56.544
But when I cut it open
and I pull out the guts...

37:59.514 --> 38:02.984
What do you think I find
in that goddamn walleye?

38:07.722 --> 38:10.490
A finger.

38:10.525 --> 38:12.425
- A finger?
- A finger.

38:12.459 --> 38:14.629
A human fucking finger.

38:14.662 --> 38:17.364
I swear to God, whole thing,
right down to the knuckle.

38:17.397 --> 38:21.602
And get this,
there's a silver ring on it.

38:23.771 --> 38:25.807
What? You don't believe me?

38:25.840 --> 38:29.577
Yeah, no, no,
it's a... it's a good story.

38:31.012 --> 38:32.747
So what did you do with it?

38:32.780 --> 38:35.750
I took it home, seasoned it up
with some salt and pepper.

38:35.783 --> 38:37.785
Fried it up
with a little butter.

38:37.819 --> 38:39.954
The fish, you jackass,
not the finger.

38:39.987 --> 38:41.055
What's wrong with you?

38:41.088 --> 38:42.824
The finger, I threw away.

38:42.857 --> 38:44.592
God.

38:44.625 --> 38:47.662
But I still got the ring.

38:47.695 --> 38:50.397
Oh, holy shit.

38:50.430 --> 38:51.966
Wait, that actually happened?

38:51.999 --> 38:53.067
No, you dumb shit.

38:53.100 --> 38:54.769
My dad gave me this ring.

38:54.802 --> 38:56.037
I goosed the fucking truth.

38:56.070 --> 38:58.139
Do you get it now?

39:00.908 --> 39:04.411
Well, thanks for the lesson,

39:04.444 --> 39:08.716
but I don't think
this needs any goosing.

39:08.749 --> 39:10.651
Ohh.

39:10.685 --> 39:12.954
I get it.

39:12.987 --> 39:14.956
College boy's come here
to teach me a lesson, huh?

39:14.989 --> 39:16.456
That'll be the day.

39:16.489 --> 39:17.692
I'm not here
to teach you a lesson.

39:17.725 --> 39:19.527
The day you walk
through that door,

39:19.560 --> 39:21.162
come in here
and teach me a lesson

39:21.195 --> 39:23.631
will be the day your old man
comes through that door again

39:23.664 --> 39:25.032
and orders a bottle of beer.

39:26.601 --> 39:28.970
Ah, fuck.

39:29.003 --> 39:31.105
I think the power went out.

39:31.138 --> 39:33.473
No shit, Einstein.

39:33.507 --> 39:34.742
- What ya gonna do?
- What am I gonna do?

39:34.775 --> 39:36.777
I've been on my feet all day.

39:36.811 --> 39:38.411
What you're gonna do,

39:38.445 --> 39:40.181
you're gonna
make yourself useful,

39:40.214 --> 39:43.184
go downstairs
and start the generator.

39:43.217 --> 39:45.119
Over there.

39:59.499 --> 40:01.736
Go on, tough guy.

40:38.639 --> 40:40.473
Where is it?

40:40.508 --> 40:43.044
In the corner,
just keep walking.

40:44.645 --> 40:45.813
Where?

40:45.846 --> 40:48.015
In the corner.

43:53.134 --> 43:54.301
No wonder it's so cold in here.

43:54.335 --> 43:57.638
The basement door is open.

43:59.907 --> 44:01.242
Paul?

45:04.805 --> 45:06.473
Sit down.

45:06.508 --> 45:08.309
Sit down!

45:12.880 --> 45:15.816
It's my turn
to tell a fucking story,

45:15.849 --> 45:17.218
so listen up.

45:28.963 --> 45:30.798
Yeah, coming up, Gordy.

45:36.370 --> 45:37.771
Did you ever hitchhike?

45:37.805 --> 45:39.240
Hitchhike, sure,
plenty of times.

45:39.273 --> 45:40.374
Yeah?

45:40.407 --> 45:41.842
When was that?

45:41.875 --> 45:43.377
Well, when I was a kid,

45:43.410 --> 45:45.346
I used to bum rides
out west all the time.

45:45.379 --> 45:47.214
Bumming rides from friends,

45:47.248 --> 45:50.784
not strictly speaking
hitchhiking.

45:50.818 --> 45:52.920
All right, I never stood
on the side of the road

45:52.953 --> 45:55.489
shouldering a bindle
on a fucking stick, no.

45:55.523 --> 45:58.292
- I take it you have?
- Oh, yeah.

45:58.325 --> 46:00.528
Well, no bindle.

46:00.562 --> 46:03.163
Yeah, I used to do it
like a lot when I was a kid.

46:03.197 --> 46:06.333
I mean, easy way to get around,

46:06.367 --> 46:07.935
the price was right.

46:07.968 --> 46:10.304
And it was safer back then.

46:10.337 --> 46:12.172
People used to
help each other out.

46:12.206 --> 46:14.208
I'm sensing a story
coming on here, Gordy.

46:14.241 --> 46:17.111
I don't know, I don't know.

46:17.144 --> 46:18.379
I mean, it's been a long time

46:18.412 --> 46:21.982
since I even thought
about this one.

46:22.016 --> 46:23.183
I've gotta tell you,
the other day,

46:23.217 --> 46:24.586
I was in the garage
and I was basically

46:24.619 --> 46:27.087
just twiddling my thumbs.

46:27.121 --> 46:29.023
As usual.

46:29.056 --> 46:35.062
And suddenly
I remembered something.

46:35.095 --> 46:37.565
And it was something
that happened to me...

46:37.599 --> 46:40.868
I hopped into
this one guy's car

46:40.901 --> 46:42.236
way back then.

46:45.406 --> 46:47.141
- Don't leave me hanging, man.
- I don't know.

46:47.174 --> 46:49.276
- You really want to hear this?
- Yes, fuck yes.

46:51.045 --> 46:53.581
Well, buckle up,
because this story's worth

46:53.615 --> 46:55.949
a thousand words,

46:55.983 --> 46:57.552
if that's an expression.

47:00.655 --> 47:02.990
You all right?

47:03.023 --> 47:06.226
Shit, I've never actually told
this story to anybody.

47:09.029 --> 47:10.497
Tommy.

47:12.667 --> 47:14.234
What?

47:14.268 --> 47:15.903
What's the matter, Gordo?

47:15.936 --> 47:17.539
Fuck off.

47:17.572 --> 47:20.107
Fuck off all...
do you need a hug, Gordo?

47:20.140 --> 47:21.175
No, fuck off, fuck off!

47:21.208 --> 47:23.077
Okay, okay, come on, Tommy,

47:23.110 --> 47:24.878
knock it off, knock it off.

47:24.912 --> 47:26.480
Christ, did you spit on me?

47:26.514 --> 47:27.948
Who's driving you home?

47:27.981 --> 47:29.584
- What?
- Who's driving you home?

47:31.952 --> 47:33.020
My dad, I think.

47:33.053 --> 47:34.922
You want me to call him?

47:34.955 --> 47:37.091
Why?

47:37.124 --> 47:39.993
To come and collect you.

47:40.027 --> 47:41.529
Yeah, sure.

47:41.563 --> 47:43.297
Daddy's gonna drive him home.

47:43.330 --> 47:45.667
Tell him he can come
collect my remains.

47:47.067 --> 47:48.335
Hysterical.

47:49.303 --> 47:52.106
You're a disgrace.

47:52.139 --> 47:54.408
- Am I?
- Yeah.

47:54.441 --> 47:56.076
You and your whole generation,

47:56.110 --> 47:57.311
you get everything
handed to you

47:57.344 --> 48:00.247
and you just piss it away.

48:00.280 --> 48:01.549
Fuck.

48:01.583 --> 48:02.983
Geez, you're cranky.

48:03.016 --> 48:05.185
What did you call me?

48:05.219 --> 48:06.153
What did you fucking call me?

48:06.186 --> 48:10.424
I said that you are
a sad, cranky old man.

48:10.457 --> 48:11.593
And you're getting upset

48:11.626 --> 48:13.227
because I interrupted
your little story

48:13.260 --> 48:15.295
about hopping into
some stranger's car

48:15.329 --> 48:16.598
and giving him a hand job.

48:16.631 --> 48:18.098
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!

48:18.132 --> 48:19.066
Come on, sit down.

48:19.099 --> 48:20.467
We getting back
to that story there, Gord?

48:20.501 --> 48:22.269
Yeah.

48:22.302 --> 48:24.572
Gordo's gonna finish his story.

48:24.606 --> 48:26.306
- Come on.
- Come on, let's hear it, Gordy.

48:26.340 --> 48:28.676
Come on. Come on.

48:33.213 --> 48:34.616
Piece of shit.

48:34.649 --> 48:37.317
This little tit, does he work?

48:37.351 --> 48:39.953
I mean, I've seen him pump gas
at Bill's a couple of times.

48:39.987 --> 48:41.589
Oh, that's really good.

48:41.623 --> 48:43.290
Good for you.

48:43.323 --> 48:45.259
- Why are you so...
- Gord!

48:45.292 --> 48:46.728
Yeah?

48:46.761 --> 48:47.896
You were saying
about hitchhiking

48:47.928 --> 48:50.297
and there was that one guy
and you got into his car...

48:50.330 --> 48:51.398
- That guy.
- Yeah.

48:51.432 --> 48:53.367
Oh, no.

48:53.400 --> 48:55.269
I was pretty young.

48:55.302 --> 48:58.706
I must've been only about 21
or 22 at the time.

48:58.740 --> 49:00.508
I was working up in that...

49:00.542 --> 49:02.342
remember that logging camp
up north of Hearst, there?

49:02.376 --> 49:03.410
Oh, yeah, yeah.

49:03.444 --> 49:06.413
Well, it was
the end of the season,

49:06.447 --> 49:09.016
like the middle of December,

49:09.049 --> 49:11.218
so I was trying to hitch a ride

49:11.251 --> 49:13.353
to get back home
for Christmas.

49:15.255 --> 49:17.024
Standing on the side
of the highway

49:17.057 --> 49:19.259
with my thumb out.

49:19.293 --> 49:22.429
And I was just having
the worst kind of fucking luck.

49:22.463 --> 49:25.432
Cars are just whipping by me,

49:25.466 --> 49:27.367
one after the other.

49:27.401 --> 49:30.437
Nobody was stopping,
and I'm freezing.

49:30.471 --> 49:35.577
It was really cold
and my feet were wet.

49:35.610 --> 49:36.744
I was miserable.

49:36.778 --> 49:39.179
And finally one guy stops,

49:39.213 --> 49:41.114
so I run to try
and catch up with him,

49:41.148 --> 49:42.750
it's just one guy in there.

49:42.784 --> 49:46.721
So he's headed south,
perfect, so I hop in.

49:46.754 --> 49:51.024
Well, I'm really, really happy
about being out of the cold.

49:55.630 --> 50:00.033
Well, I'm telling you as sure
as I'm sitting here right now,

50:00.067 --> 50:04.171
I'm getting this bad,
bad vibe from this guy.

50:04.204 --> 50:08.710
First off,
he doesn't even look at me.

50:08.743 --> 50:10.410
God, I remember it so well.

50:10.444 --> 50:12.412
He doesn't even look at me,

50:12.446 --> 50:14.616
even when I tell him
where I'm going,

50:14.649 --> 50:16.518
he doesn't look at me.

50:16.551 --> 50:18.620
And it's still light out,

50:18.653 --> 50:21.388
but I look over at him,
and he's like in the dark,

50:21.421 --> 50:23.156
it's like he's sitting
in a shadow.

50:23.190 --> 50:26.093
And second off,
he doesn't say anything.

50:26.126 --> 50:30.330
He's not gonna say
a single goddamn word to me.

50:33.568 --> 50:35.502
So it's getting kinda awkward.

50:35.537 --> 50:37.304
Very awkward.

50:37.337 --> 50:39.139
So I figure, okay,
I'll do the talking,

50:39.172 --> 50:41.108
I'll start talking,
so I start telling him

50:41.141 --> 50:43.377
about fascinating stuff,
this, that, and the other,

50:43.410 --> 50:46.748
and meanwhile, I'm getting
nothing from this guy at all.

50:46.781 --> 50:48.315
Not even an,
"Oh, is that right?"

50:48.348 --> 50:49.449
Nothing.

50:49.483 --> 50:53.453
So now it's going from weird
to like really weird.

50:53.487 --> 50:54.756
Very uncomfortable.

50:54.789 --> 50:58.492
Now, I've run out
of things to say, so...

50:58.526 --> 51:00.562
and neither of us are saying
anything at this point,

51:00.595 --> 51:04.632
we're just sitting there
driving in silence, oh, my God.

51:04.666 --> 51:08.703
And it just... it stays that way
like for a long time.

51:08.736 --> 51:11.271
So now I'm just kinda
looking out the window,

51:11.305 --> 51:15.442
I'm watching the trees go by
and I dare not fall asleep.

51:15.475 --> 51:20.147
And out of the clear blue,
I hear him say to me something.

51:20.180 --> 51:21.849
And what I hear him say is...

51:23.718 --> 51:27.454
"So where do you think
you're going?"

51:27.487 --> 51:28.690
So I says,
"Where do I think I'm going?

51:28.723 --> 51:31.325
I'm going to Kirkland Lake."

51:31.358 --> 51:33.193
And he kind of does this laugh.

51:33.226 --> 51:34.394
I don't know
if it's a laugh or not,

51:34.428 --> 51:36.798
but he started this laugh,

51:36.831 --> 51:40.835
and then he says,
"No, after that.

51:40.868 --> 51:42.804
After you die.

51:42.837 --> 51:44.471
I'm gonna ask you again, boy.

51:44.505 --> 51:46.273
Where is it you think
you're going?

51:46.306 --> 51:47.742
Is it gonna be heaven?

51:47.775 --> 51:50.578
Or is it gonna be hell?"

51:50.612 --> 51:53.246
That's what he asked me.

51:53.280 --> 51:55.282
After all this time,
I'm sitting in his car

51:55.315 --> 51:57.885
and that's the first thing
he says to me.

51:57.919 --> 51:59.554
That's what he asks me.

51:59.587 --> 52:01.221
Jesus Christ, what'd you say?

52:01.254 --> 52:04.626
Well, I don't want
to make things weirder.

52:04.659 --> 52:07.729
So I say, "Heaven."

52:07.762 --> 52:09.664
'Cause I suppose
it's best to answer him.

52:09.697 --> 52:10.798
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

52:10.832 --> 52:14.167
And he kinds laughs again
and he says,

52:14.201 --> 52:15.469
"Well, that's what I thought

52:15.502 --> 52:17.204
when I was
a little puke like you

52:17.237 --> 52:18.673
and I was your age.

52:18.706 --> 52:22.744
Back when the future was
stretched out before me

52:22.777 --> 52:24.846
like an open highway.

52:24.879 --> 52:27.381
But then things happen,
then things change,

52:27.414 --> 52:29.751
and you find yourself
going down on roads

52:29.784 --> 52:31.686
that you never
would have imagined."

52:31.719 --> 52:34.454
And he starts going on and on
after roads,

52:34.488 --> 52:35.757
and I'm trying to decide,
what do I do?

52:35.790 --> 52:38.593
Do I just bail out of the car?

52:38.626 --> 52:40.828
Or do I just continue
to play it cool?

52:40.862 --> 52:43.397
I mean, trust me, I wanted
the hell out of that car

52:43.430 --> 52:45.232
as much as I wanted anything
in my life.

52:45.265 --> 52:47.434
I was scared stiff!

52:47.467 --> 52:49.604
Is that when you gave the guy
the handjob?

52:49.637 --> 52:51.739
Shut the fuck up, Tommy.

52:52.940 --> 52:54.441
What happened then?

52:54.474 --> 52:56.811
Well, really, actually nothing.

52:56.844 --> 52:58.345
Just sitting there in silence

52:58.378 --> 53:00.313
and eventually we make it
to Kirkland Lake,

53:00.347 --> 53:03.951
he pulls off after the exit
onto the shoulder,

53:03.985 --> 53:05.520
he's gonna let me out.

53:05.553 --> 53:07.254
But I don't go right away.

53:07.287 --> 53:09.524
I'm sort of waiting
for a second,

53:09.557 --> 53:11.358
because I kind of felt like
he had something else

53:11.391 --> 53:12.593
that he wanted to tell me.

53:14.261 --> 53:17.565
So I took a breath and I started
turning towards him.

53:17.598 --> 53:19.834
And he's looking straight at me.

53:20.835 --> 53:23.403
And he says, "Kid,

53:23.437 --> 53:25.540
you're going to hell.

53:25.573 --> 53:27.274
You are going to hell,

53:27.307 --> 53:28.609
and not because
you've been bad,

53:28.643 --> 53:29.911
not because you've been good,

53:29.944 --> 53:32.379
but because we all go there.

53:32.412 --> 53:35.382
And when you get there,
you remember this.

53:35.415 --> 53:38.786
You come and see me
and you say hello."

53:56.938 --> 53:58.673
Fuck that guy, Gordy.

53:58.706 --> 54:00.340
Yeah, Gordy, fuck that guy.

54:00.373 --> 54:02.375
That guy is nothing
but a miserable old fuck.

54:02.409 --> 54:04.846
He doesn't mean nothing.

54:04.879 --> 54:07.347
Except I'm that miserable
old fuck now.

54:07.380 --> 54:10.051
Oh, no, no, come on,
cheer up, pal.

54:10.084 --> 54:10.918
I'd flip a switch.

54:10.952 --> 54:13.386
If there was a switch,
I'd flip it.

54:15.523 --> 54:19.026
Fact is, I've been feeling
very strange lately.

54:19.060 --> 54:22.563
I really have, like not caring.

54:22.597 --> 54:25.465
Like nothing's
all that important.

54:25.499 --> 54:26.868
Sometimes it's the end
of my day,

54:26.901 --> 54:28.035
and I realize
I'm still working on

54:28.069 --> 54:29.937
the same
cock-sucking oil change.

54:29.971 --> 54:31.539
We all have days like that.

54:31.572 --> 54:33.340
No, I...

54:33.373 --> 54:35.375
I've been working there
for 28 years,

54:35.408 --> 54:37.979
busting my ass
at the stupid garage.

54:38.012 --> 54:39.446
Twenty-eight years!

54:41.448 --> 54:43.551
Like, that's a long time.

54:43.584 --> 54:45.586
That's a long to be
spinning your wheels.

54:45.620 --> 54:48.421
That's a long time
to not make any progress,

54:48.455 --> 54:50.658
and I'm telling you,
I really believed in my heart

54:50.691 --> 54:52.627
that I would make something.

54:52.660 --> 54:56.664
I thought that
Stevie would stick around,

54:56.697 --> 54:58.465
I thought that
Stevie would kind of

54:58.498 --> 55:01.536
learn the trade
and we'd build the business.

55:04.772 --> 55:06.941
But he didn't, he left.

55:06.974 --> 55:09.342
Didn't like it here.

55:09.376 --> 55:10.845
None of them like it here.

55:13.681 --> 55:16.349
I don't think
he liked me much neither.

55:19.787 --> 55:22.557
Shit, I haven't even talked
to him for two years.

55:24.592 --> 55:26.994
And I worry about him,
goddamn it.

55:32.834 --> 55:35.670
That boy was so impressionable.

55:35.703 --> 55:37.705
I used to see it,
he used to always be hanging

55:37.738 --> 55:40.007
with the wrong guys.

55:40.041 --> 55:43.476
He was making bad decisions.

55:47.414 --> 55:49.684
Right now, I really worry
that he's got himself involved

55:49.717 --> 55:52.587
in some really ugly shit.

55:52.620 --> 55:54.487
And me, just gotta look at me,

55:54.522 --> 55:56.724
I'm falling apart here,
I'm getting old,

55:56.757 --> 56:00.161
and I've got nothing
to show for it.

56:00.194 --> 56:01.963
So I think
that's why that story

56:01.996 --> 56:03.564
popped into my head
when it did,

56:03.598 --> 56:06.701
because, you know,
the guy was right.

56:06.734 --> 56:08.102
You've gotta admit that.

56:08.135 --> 56:10.538
I did end up in hell.

56:10.571 --> 56:12.439
I'm in hell.

56:12.472 --> 56:13.608
There's not really
a goddamn thing

56:13.641 --> 56:15.543
I can do about it.

56:36.496 --> 56:38.599
So?

56:38.633 --> 56:40.801
What do you say about that,
smart guy?

56:40.835 --> 56:42.435
Hmm?

56:42.469 --> 56:44.171
What do you say about a guy
who comes from nothing,

56:44.205 --> 56:46.607
starts his own business,
and then breaks his back

56:46.641 --> 56:48.175
just to put his kid
through school,

56:48.209 --> 56:51.112
his ungrateful kid?

56:51.145 --> 56:52.847
I wasn't ungrateful.

56:52.880 --> 56:55.583
That's not what he said.

56:55.616 --> 56:57.484
- He wouldn't have said that.
- What's that?

56:57.518 --> 56:59.787
He wouldn't have said
that I was ungrateful.

56:59.820 --> 57:01.488
- He sure did.
- No, he didn't.

57:01.522 --> 57:02.657
- Yes, he did.
- No, he didn't!

57:02.690 --> 57:04.158
Stop goosing the fucking truth!

57:04.191 --> 57:06.193
Oh, I get it.

57:06.227 --> 57:08.729
You just want to forget, huh?

57:08.763 --> 57:11.098
Okay, I can play that game.

57:11.132 --> 57:15.202
Let's just forget about
all of the money you owe me

57:15.236 --> 57:16.771
and all of the money
you owe Stellie,

57:16.804 --> 57:19.006
and let's just talk
about how your old man

57:19.040 --> 57:20.708
had to sell his fucking business

57:20.741 --> 57:22.710
to put you through school.

57:22.743 --> 57:25.179
Then let's talk about
what you did with that.

57:25.212 --> 57:27.581
You pissed it away,
you flunked out,

57:27.615 --> 57:29.750
and you drifted around
until you ran out of money.

57:29.784 --> 57:31.252
Meanwhile, your old man
worked himself

57:31.285 --> 57:33.521
into an early grave.

57:40.995 --> 57:42.063
It wasn't the work
that killed him.

57:42.096 --> 57:43.597
What'd you say?

57:45.566 --> 57:47.034
It wasn't the work
that killed him.

57:47.068 --> 57:48.069
It was the bottle,

57:48.102 --> 57:51.072
and we both know
who's responsible for that!

59:30.871 --> 59:32.239
All right, let's finish this.

59:32.273 --> 59:34.175
We are finished.

59:34.208 --> 59:36.043
But you still haven't heard
the beginning of the story yet.

59:36.077 --> 59:38.579
It doesn't make sense otherwise.

59:41.115 --> 59:43.217
Hey, are you listening to me?

59:45.286 --> 59:48.189
Hey, if I tell you the rest,
are you going to listen?

59:48.222 --> 59:50.658
You can do whatever you want,
kid, it's almost midnight.

59:54.662 --> 59:57.331
So it was earlier that evening.

01:00:30.698 --> 01:00:32.166
Bar's closed.

01:00:33.834 --> 01:00:35.970
Closed or closing?

01:00:36.003 --> 01:00:38.405
Well, it depends
on what you need.

01:00:38.439 --> 01:00:40.441
Well, I don't mean to be a pain,

01:00:40.474 --> 01:00:43.777
I just... I've been driving
all day.

01:00:43.811 --> 01:00:45.246
- Pretty bad out there?
- Yeah, yeah,

01:00:45.279 --> 01:00:46.747
it's really bad.

01:00:46.780 --> 01:00:49.183
Anyways, I can see
you're closed...

01:00:49.216 --> 01:00:50.384
Yes sir, I was just about
to walk over there

01:00:50.417 --> 01:00:52.386
and lock the door.

01:00:52.419 --> 01:00:54.255
I mean, you'd be doing me
a huge favor

01:00:54.288 --> 01:00:57.224
if you could just do
one more round.

01:00:57.258 --> 01:01:01.162
Well, I suppose I've got time
for one more round.

01:01:01.195 --> 01:01:02.897
Oh, thank you.

01:01:02.930 --> 01:01:04.832
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

01:01:08.903 --> 01:01:10.337
You're a lifesaver.

01:01:10.371 --> 01:01:13.407
And you're a paying customer.

01:01:13.440 --> 01:01:15.176
So what'll it be?

01:01:15.209 --> 01:01:17.745
Um, beer, beer's fine.

01:01:17.778 --> 01:01:19.480
Which brand?

01:01:19.514 --> 01:01:20.981
Bartender's choice.

01:01:21.015 --> 01:01:22.750
That's easy enough.

01:01:24.852 --> 01:01:27.188
- You want a glass?
- No, no.

01:01:32.927 --> 01:01:34.028
Cheers.

01:01:43.003 --> 01:01:45.873
Oh, yeah, yeah, that is...

01:01:45.906 --> 01:01:47.942
that is exactly
what the doctor ordered.

01:01:47.975 --> 01:01:49.410
You just passing through?

01:01:49.443 --> 01:01:52.112
Yeah, I'm just headed in
from Toronto.

01:01:52.146 --> 01:01:54.181
Oh, yeah?
Which way you headed?

01:01:54.215 --> 01:01:55.282
Kapuskasing.

01:01:55.316 --> 01:01:56.917
Oh, Toronto to the Kap.

01:01:56.951 --> 01:01:58.819
That is one long haul.

01:01:58.852 --> 01:02:00.754
Yeah, tell me about it.

01:02:00.788 --> 01:02:02.289
I thought I could do it all
in one shot,

01:02:02.323 --> 01:02:05.159
but it is slow going
in this weather.

01:02:05.192 --> 01:02:06.994
Yeah, it's brutal.

01:02:07.027 --> 01:02:08.295
Whatever happened
to that global warming

01:02:08.329 --> 01:02:09.797
they keep talking about?

01:02:09.830 --> 01:02:11.298
I don't know.

01:02:11.332 --> 01:02:14.401
- Bring it on.
- Yeah, ice caps be damned.

01:02:17.438 --> 01:02:20.874
Hey, um, how much longer
would you say it is

01:02:20.908 --> 01:02:21.842
to the Kap, anyway?

01:02:21.875 --> 01:02:25.346
Oh, I'd say at least
another 250 clicks.

01:02:25.379 --> 01:02:27.214
It wouldn't be so bad
if it was during the day,

01:02:27.248 --> 01:02:31.553
but that storm, shit,
you could be driving all night.

01:02:35.456 --> 01:02:37.491
So what's happening
in Kapuskasing?

01:02:39.561 --> 01:02:41.962
Um...

01:02:41.996 --> 01:02:44.265
I know, I should apologize
for being so nosy,

01:02:44.298 --> 01:02:46.300
but I'm a bartender,
it's my job to get you talking.

01:02:46.333 --> 01:02:48.402
Right, right.

01:02:48.435 --> 01:02:52.239
I just got some family business
to attend to.

01:02:52.273 --> 01:02:53.240
Well, if it's none
of my business,

01:02:53.274 --> 01:02:55.075
- you just say the word.
- No, no, you know what?

01:02:55.109 --> 01:02:58.912
After being alone
in the car all day,

01:02:58.946 --> 01:03:01.583
it's nice to finally have
someone to talk to.

01:03:01.616 --> 01:03:05.419
Yeah, I'm heading up there
to see my father.

01:03:05.452 --> 01:03:07.888
- Oh?
- He's not well.

01:03:07.921 --> 01:03:08.956
What's he got?

01:03:08.989 --> 01:03:10.391
That's the thing, I mean,

01:03:10.424 --> 01:03:12.126
every time I call the hospital,

01:03:12.159 --> 01:03:14.562
I get a different doctor
who gives me a different story,

01:03:14.596 --> 01:03:17.498
so it's really hard to tell
what's going on.

01:03:17.532 --> 01:03:19.066
Yeah, I know what you mean.

01:03:19.099 --> 01:03:21.902
So I just figured to, well,

01:03:21.935 --> 01:03:23.571
I might as well
drive on up there

01:03:23.605 --> 01:03:27.207
and see him and meet
those doctors in person.

01:03:27.241 --> 01:03:29.043
Yeah.

01:03:29.076 --> 01:03:30.477
My wife's mother died last year.

01:03:30.512 --> 01:03:32.112
She was living down
in Antigonish,

01:03:32.146 --> 01:03:33.247
all by herself.

01:03:33.280 --> 01:03:34.415
When she got sick,
there was no one

01:03:34.448 --> 01:03:37.017
to drive her to the hospital,
cook her meals for her,

01:03:37.051 --> 01:03:38.419
make sure
she took her medication,

01:03:38.452 --> 01:03:40.555
so believe me,
I understand the frustration

01:03:40.588 --> 01:03:43.090
of not being near
a sick relative.

01:03:43.123 --> 01:03:45.959
Yeah, yeah, I mean,
I can appreciate that,

01:03:45.993 --> 01:03:48.162
- thank you.
- Anyway, driving up there

01:03:48.195 --> 01:03:50.364
- is the right thing to do.
- Yeah.

01:03:50.397 --> 01:03:52.032
He'll be happy to see you.

01:03:52.066 --> 01:03:53.334
Yeah.

01:03:53.367 --> 01:03:54.602
You two are close?

01:03:57.938 --> 01:04:02.176
We barely speak,
but I mean, when I was a kid,

01:04:02.209 --> 01:04:04.211
we were very close.

01:04:05.379 --> 01:04:06.380
What happened?

01:04:09.950 --> 01:04:10.984
Life, I guess.

01:04:11.018 --> 01:04:15.590
I mean, I'm sure
it's the same for everyone.

01:04:15.623 --> 01:04:17.525
You grow up, you move out,

01:04:17.559 --> 01:04:18.992
you start a new life,

01:04:19.026 --> 01:04:22.429
and then a year passes,
two years, 10 years,

01:04:22.463 --> 01:04:25.132
and, well, you find yourself

01:04:25.165 --> 01:04:26.900
so far away
from where you started

01:04:26.934 --> 01:04:29.036
that it's hard to get back.

01:04:29.069 --> 01:04:30.404
Shit.

01:04:30.437 --> 01:04:31.972
I know why you wanted that beer.

01:04:34.341 --> 01:04:37.579
Anyways, it's great to get out
of the city, you know?

01:04:37.612 --> 01:04:39.647
I mean, the drive up
brought back

01:04:39.681 --> 01:04:42.015
so many great memories.

01:04:42.049 --> 01:04:45.319
The sights, the sounds,
the smells,

01:04:45.352 --> 01:04:47.154
especially the smells.

01:04:47.187 --> 01:04:50.324
That crisp,
clean smell of the cold.

01:04:50.357 --> 01:04:53.293
Right? So cold that
it freezes your nostrils.

01:04:53.327 --> 01:04:54.662
Yeah, it's been
a pretty bad winter,

01:04:54.696 --> 01:04:55.663
one of the coldest in a while.

01:04:55.697 --> 01:04:59.066
Yeah, you know,
the worst winter I can remember

01:04:59.099 --> 01:05:03.003
was 1988.

01:05:03.036 --> 01:05:04.171
Oh, yeah.

01:05:04.204 --> 01:05:05.973
I remember '88.

01:05:06.006 --> 01:05:08.175
Snowed every day in January.

01:05:08.208 --> 01:05:10.578
Yeah, I mean, and that would
have been fine by me,

01:05:10.612 --> 01:05:15.082
but when the sun went down
and the wind picked up,

01:05:15.115 --> 01:05:18.452
I have never known a cold
like that before or since.

01:05:18.485 --> 01:05:20.988
You see, back then,
we were living on a pig farm

01:05:21.021 --> 01:05:22.624
just outside of Belleville,

01:05:22.657 --> 01:05:23.691
and there was this one night

01:05:23.725 --> 01:05:25.660
when my dad needed help
in the barn

01:05:25.693 --> 01:05:27.995
because we had this sow

01:05:28.028 --> 01:05:29.697
that was having
a difficult pregnancy.

01:05:29.731 --> 01:05:33.167
But I mean, I was just a kid,
so all I could do

01:05:33.200 --> 01:05:37.070
was just hold a flashlight.

01:05:37.104 --> 01:05:40.174
And as it turned out,
the sow was fine.

01:05:40.207 --> 01:05:43.177
And out of her come
a litter of six, you know.

01:05:43.210 --> 01:05:47.080
Five healthy ones
and one stillborn.

01:05:52.520 --> 01:05:54.054
Now, when that happens,

01:05:54.087 --> 01:05:55.255
you have to get rid
of the dead one,

01:05:55.289 --> 01:05:57.224
otherwise it upsets the mother,

01:05:57.257 --> 01:06:01.328
so my dad told me to take it out
to the end of our property

01:06:01.361 --> 01:06:03.531
and throw it in the forest.

01:06:06.133 --> 01:06:09.403
He said that way the coyotes
will come and get it

01:06:09.436 --> 01:06:13.106
and they'd stay off our farm.

01:06:13.140 --> 01:06:17.512
But needless to say,
I didn't want to do it,

01:06:17.545 --> 01:06:21.783
but when my dad gave an order,

01:06:21.816 --> 01:06:24.151
you'd better fucking do it.

01:06:32.192 --> 01:06:35.295
You ever been on a farm
during a full moon

01:06:35.329 --> 01:06:37.331
all alone under
the soft blue light?

01:06:38.633 --> 01:06:40.100
Yeah.

01:06:40.133 --> 01:06:44.739
Well, I remember on that night
under that moon,

01:06:44.772 --> 01:06:48.676
the pig glistened
like a dead fish.

01:06:48.710 --> 01:06:50.310
I remember that
it was still warm

01:06:50.344 --> 01:06:53.781
and there was steam
coming off of its body.

01:06:53.815 --> 01:06:55.315
I remember it took a long time

01:06:55.349 --> 01:06:57.150
to walk out to the tree line
in the dark.

01:06:57.184 --> 01:06:59.821
I remember the crunch
of the snow

01:06:59.854 --> 01:07:01.756
and the sting of the wind.

01:07:04.358 --> 01:07:05.693
But...

01:07:08.563 --> 01:07:10.698
...most of all,
I remember the sadness.

01:07:13.200 --> 01:07:16.604
That sinking feeling
of childhood sadness.

01:07:20.140 --> 01:07:21.709
So instead of doing
what I was told,

01:07:21.743 --> 01:07:26.413
I just... I just stopped
and I stood there

01:07:26.446 --> 01:07:29.383
and I...

01:07:29.416 --> 01:07:30.785
I started to cry.

01:07:34.187 --> 01:07:36.591
I bawled my eyes out
for this poor little animal

01:07:36.624 --> 01:07:38.125
who never had a chance to live,

01:07:38.158 --> 01:07:40.828
I mean, I just...

01:07:40.862 --> 01:07:42.730
I just wanted to be
back in my bed, you know,

01:07:42.764 --> 01:07:45.098
and far away from it all and...

01:07:47.200 --> 01:07:51.138
But all I could do was
just stand there

01:07:51.171 --> 01:07:55.175
as the tears froze
against my cheeks.

01:08:01.583 --> 01:08:04.686
I finally got it together
and I...

01:08:04.719 --> 01:08:07.220
I said a little prayer and...

01:08:08.790 --> 01:08:12.192
Well, I knelt down
and I put that little animal

01:08:12.225 --> 01:08:13.895
down on the snow.

01:08:32.580 --> 01:08:34.314
Jesus.

01:08:34.348 --> 01:08:36.316
Yeah.

01:08:36.350 --> 01:08:40.654
That goddamn little pig
was still alive.

01:08:40.688 --> 01:08:46.225
But I mean, I was just a kid.

01:08:46.259 --> 01:08:48.630
But I knew, I just knew
that there was nothing

01:08:48.662 --> 01:08:51.532
that I could do
to help it survive,

01:08:51.566 --> 01:08:53.701
especially through
a night like that.

01:08:53.734 --> 01:08:56.236
I definitely could not
bring it back to my father,

01:08:56.269 --> 01:09:01.341
because if I did,
there would be hell to pay.

01:09:01.375 --> 01:09:03.243
That said...

01:09:06.380 --> 01:09:07.279
I couldn't stand the thought

01:09:07.314 --> 01:09:12.654
of just leaving it there
to freeze to death.

01:09:15.523 --> 01:09:17.692
So what'd you do?

01:09:20.895 --> 01:09:22.796
I picked him up,
I tightened my grip,

01:09:22.830 --> 01:09:25.198
and I snapped his neck.

01:09:29.236 --> 01:09:32.205
Just like I'm gonna snap yours,
you fucking rat.

01:09:32.238 --> 01:09:33.640
Huh?

01:14:47.088 --> 01:14:48.889
So he's dead?

01:14:48.923 --> 01:14:50.524
Dead?

01:14:50.558 --> 01:14:51.892
He got his fucking head
chopped off.

01:14:51.926 --> 01:14:53.794
No, no, no, not that guy,

01:14:53.828 --> 01:14:55.696
the second guy,
the well-dressed guy,

01:14:55.730 --> 01:14:57.231
the guy who came in afterwards.

01:14:57.264 --> 01:14:59.233
Yeah, he's dead, too.

01:14:59.266 --> 01:15:00.701
Why'd he chop his head off?

01:15:00.735 --> 01:15:03.537
He didn't.

01:15:03.571 --> 01:15:05.806
He got beaten to death
with a phone.

01:15:05.840 --> 01:15:08.676
No, no!

01:15:08.709 --> 01:15:10.544
No, not him, the other guy,
the first guy.

01:15:10.578 --> 01:15:12.313
Oh, yeah,
completely decapitated.

01:15:12.346 --> 01:15:14.248
- Why?
- I don't know.

01:15:14.281 --> 01:15:15.950
Well, it sounds
like a hit, right?

01:15:15.983 --> 01:15:18.019
A goddamn execution.

01:15:25.993 --> 01:15:27.228
Gotta hand it to you,
college boy,

01:15:27.261 --> 01:15:30.097
- that was a good one.
- Wait, what?

01:15:30.131 --> 01:15:32.099
Goosed it up real good.

01:15:32.133 --> 01:15:34.068
I didn't goose anything.

01:15:34.101 --> 01:15:35.836
- That's what happened.
- Uh-huh.

01:15:35.870 --> 01:15:37.805
You don't believe me?

01:15:37.838 --> 01:15:39.640
- No.
- How come.

01:15:39.673 --> 01:15:41.809
Because you can't snow
the snowman,

01:15:41.842 --> 01:15:42.977
you know what I mean?

01:15:43.010 --> 01:15:44.712
No.

01:15:44.745 --> 01:15:45.913
You say this really happened.

01:15:45.946 --> 01:15:47.181
- Yeah.
- When?

01:15:47.214 --> 01:15:48.582
Saturday night.

01:15:48.616 --> 01:15:50.284
- In Elk Lake.
- That's right.

01:15:50.317 --> 01:15:53.020
Then why haven't I heard
anything about it?

01:15:53.054 --> 01:15:56.624
Because the police
are shitting themselves.

01:15:56.657 --> 01:15:58.793
They're not releasing
any information

01:15:58.826 --> 01:16:02.763
and, I don't know,
in a storm like this?

01:16:02.797 --> 01:16:05.766
Everything just slows down.

01:16:05.800 --> 01:16:08.302
It's not like the news
caught wind of it.

01:16:09.870 --> 01:16:12.173
Okay. Okay, I'll grant you that.

01:16:12.206 --> 01:16:13.240
But let me get this straight:

01:16:13.274 --> 01:16:16.310
You just told me about a crime.

01:16:16.343 --> 01:16:18.012
Hasn't been leaked
to the media,

01:16:18.045 --> 01:16:20.314
police aren't talking about it,

01:16:20.347 --> 01:16:21.849
for which there are
no survivors.

01:16:21.882 --> 01:16:23.951
Correct?

01:16:23.984 --> 01:16:25.920
So how are you able
to tell me the complete story

01:16:25.953 --> 01:16:29.390
in such precise detail?

01:16:29.423 --> 01:16:32.626
Well, because this.

01:16:32.660 --> 01:16:34.929
This is the craziest part.

01:16:34.962 --> 01:16:37.631
While all this is going down,

01:16:37.665 --> 01:16:40.367
the killer is
under the impression

01:16:40.401 --> 01:16:42.803
that the bar is empty.

01:16:42.837 --> 01:16:44.271
But it wasn't.

01:16:44.305 --> 01:16:47.408
There was a guy,
nearly passed out,

01:16:47.441 --> 01:16:50.344
in the far corner of the bar.

01:16:52.446 --> 01:16:54.048
He was hiding in the shadows.

01:16:54.081 --> 01:16:55.816
He saw the whole thing.

01:17:07.928 --> 01:17:10.331
And he didn't do
anything about it?

01:17:10.364 --> 01:17:12.766
Nope.

01:17:12.800 --> 01:17:15.136
Who's the guy?

01:17:15.169 --> 01:17:18.339
The aptly named Thomas Coward.

01:17:20.441 --> 01:17:22.276
- Tommy Coward?
- Yeah, it's funny

01:17:22.309 --> 01:17:24.445
that you mentioned him earlier.

01:17:24.478 --> 01:17:26.013
What's he doing in Elk Lake?

01:17:26.046 --> 01:17:28.782
I thought he was pumping gas
for Bill's two boys.

01:17:28.816 --> 01:17:31.051
He was, but the brothers,
they got into a fight

01:17:31.085 --> 01:17:32.286
and split up the business.

01:17:32.319 --> 01:17:33.754
You know.

01:17:33.787 --> 01:17:35.122
I know Dennis from way back.

01:17:35.156 --> 01:17:36.957
I was helping out
at the garage,

01:17:36.991 --> 01:17:41.362
and that's where Tommy
told us the whole story

01:17:41.395 --> 01:17:43.097
- Monday morning.
- Wait, wait, wait.

01:17:43.130 --> 01:17:46.734
You're saying that
Tommy just sat back

01:17:46.767 --> 01:17:48.836
and watched two people
get killed.

01:17:48.869 --> 01:17:51.038
Yeah.

01:17:51.071 --> 01:17:52.873
But he could have intervened
at any point,

01:17:52.907 --> 01:17:54.074
he could have stopped it.

01:17:54.108 --> 01:17:56.076
I guess so.

01:17:56.110 --> 01:17:58.479
- Nobody had to die.
- No.

01:17:58.513 --> 01:18:01.048
And get this, not only that,

01:18:01.081 --> 01:18:02.449
but you have to remember,

01:18:02.483 --> 01:18:04.318
Ken was closing up,

01:18:04.351 --> 01:18:07.188
so if he would have gone
and locked the door

01:18:07.221 --> 01:18:10.357
before he started mopping,

01:18:10.391 --> 01:18:12.026
this guy
wouldn't have gotten in,

01:18:12.059 --> 01:18:14.828
and none of this
would've happened.

01:18:14.862 --> 01:18:17.164
But why Ken, what did he do?

01:18:17.198 --> 01:18:18.933
I don't know.

01:18:18.966 --> 01:18:20.901
Random death, you know?

01:18:20.935 --> 01:18:22.369
You think
you're on steady ground

01:18:22.403 --> 01:18:25.272
and then the earth opens up
and swallows you whole.

01:18:25.306 --> 01:18:27.041
A guy chopped
his fucking head off, Stevie,

01:18:27.074 --> 01:18:29.476
there had to be a reason.

01:18:29.511 --> 01:18:33.047
I guess some things
just can't be explained.

01:18:34.882 --> 01:18:36.150
I don't know.

01:18:38.185 --> 01:18:41.155
Maybe he got the wrong guy.

01:18:41.188 --> 01:18:42.990
What do you mean wrong guy?

01:18:43.023 --> 01:18:44.325
Hey, where are you going?

01:18:46.093 --> 01:18:47.027
Just grabbing my stuff.

01:18:47.061 --> 01:18:51.098
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, just wait.

01:18:51.131 --> 01:18:53.334
Let me... let me
buy you a drink.

01:18:54.935 --> 01:18:57.471
You're gonna buy me a drink?

01:18:57.504 --> 01:18:59.039
Take it before
I change my mind.

01:19:07.915 --> 01:19:11.952
What do you mean by,
"maybe he got the wrong guy"?

01:19:13.954 --> 01:19:16.890
I mean, from my understanding,

01:19:16.924 --> 01:19:20.394
Ken was a... Ken was a good guy.

01:19:20.427 --> 01:19:25.533
He worked 60 hours a week,
woke up early on Sundays,

01:19:25.567 --> 01:19:28.402
shoveled the church parking lot.

01:19:28.435 --> 01:19:30.437
He didn't have an enemy
in the world.

01:19:30.471 --> 01:19:32.940
And...

01:19:32.973 --> 01:19:34.241
What?

01:19:34.275 --> 01:19:36.343
I don't know.

01:19:36.377 --> 01:19:38.112
Like you said,

01:19:38.145 --> 01:19:40.314
sounds like some kind
of organized crime thing.

01:19:40.347 --> 01:19:43.585
Like, "Bring me the head
of Alfredo Garcia."

01:19:43.618 --> 01:19:45.319
Who?

01:19:45.352 --> 01:19:46.920
Never mind.

01:19:46.954 --> 01:19:51.559
Just suppose you're a guy,

01:19:51.593 --> 01:19:54.228
asked to do a job like that.

01:19:54.261 --> 01:19:56.330
You're not from around here.

01:19:56.363 --> 01:19:59.166
You're driving up Highway 11

01:19:59.199 --> 01:20:01.135
in a snowstorm.

01:20:01.168 --> 01:20:06.940
You start passing signs
for Elk Lake, Dog Lake,

01:20:06.974 --> 01:20:08.309
Desert Lake, Kirkland Lake,

01:20:08.342 --> 01:20:12.012
and the other little
goddamn lakes along the way.

01:20:12.046 --> 01:20:17.519
One wrong turn,
you're in the wrong town

01:20:17.552 --> 01:20:20.154
at the wrong bar

01:20:20.187 --> 01:20:22.389
killing the wrong guy.

01:20:28.996 --> 01:20:30.998
I mean, it could happen.

01:20:53.487 --> 01:20:58.959
Well, I guess we'll never know
the whole story.

01:20:58.992 --> 01:21:03.163
I mean, it's not like
he left behind a business card.

01:21:06.500 --> 01:21:07.968
Right?

01:21:08.001 --> 01:21:09.436
Nope.

01:21:13.407 --> 01:21:16.377
Except the name he said
before he killed him.

01:21:30.090 --> 01:21:32.025
What name?

01:21:32.059 --> 01:21:34.328
Oh. Oh, shit.

01:21:34.361 --> 01:21:35.496
You got me so worked up,

01:21:35.530 --> 01:21:37.097
I didn't tell the story
properly.

01:21:37.131 --> 01:21:39.032
What fucking name?

01:21:40.535 --> 01:21:44.138
Well, right after
he smashed Ken's face in,

01:21:44.171 --> 01:21:46.574
he stood over him and said,

01:21:46.608 --> 01:21:49.476
"Jimmy Thompson
sends his regards."

01:21:53.380 --> 01:21:54.682
Jimmy Thompson.

01:21:54.716 --> 01:21:55.683
Who?

01:21:55.717 --> 01:21:57.217
Jimmy fucking Thompson.

01:21:59.019 --> 01:22:02.489
Jimmy fucking Thompson.

01:22:06.360 --> 01:22:08.495
Are you sure?

01:22:08.530 --> 01:22:10.464
Pretty sure.

01:22:14.001 --> 01:22:16.370
Do... do you think
he maybe could have said

01:22:16.403 --> 01:22:18.238
a different name?

01:22:18.272 --> 01:22:21.576
In the story that Tommy told me,

01:22:21.609 --> 01:22:23.511
it was Jimmy Thompson.

01:22:23.545 --> 01:22:26.548
He could be wrong.

01:22:26.581 --> 01:22:27.749
He was pretty sure.

01:22:27.782 --> 01:22:29.651
Or you could be wrong.

01:22:29.684 --> 01:22:30.552
What do you mean?

01:22:30.585 --> 01:22:32.319
He could be wrong,
you could be wrong.

01:22:32.352 --> 01:22:34.388
Nobody's got a perfect
fucking memory, right?

01:22:34.421 --> 01:22:36.190
What's the problem?

01:22:44.498 --> 01:22:45.767
Nothing.

01:23:02.750 --> 01:23:04.117
It's beautiful, though.

01:23:04.151 --> 01:23:06.119
Huh?

01:23:06.153 --> 01:23:08.288
The snow.

01:23:08.322 --> 01:23:11.659
It really does look
like a movie out there.

01:23:15.229 --> 01:23:17.765
Too bad you won't get
to enjoy it much longer.

01:23:21.368 --> 01:23:22.604
Why not?

01:23:26.674 --> 01:23:29.611
It's gonna melt.

01:23:29.644 --> 01:23:31.813
The temperature's
supposed to go up tomorrow.

01:23:37.451 --> 01:23:40.420
Do you think
I could get that now?

01:24:03.210 --> 01:24:04.311
You just finish your beer

01:24:04.344 --> 01:24:06.480
and get the hell
out of here, Stevie.
