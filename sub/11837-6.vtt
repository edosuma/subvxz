00:01.601 --> 00:02.903
BERLUTI:
Previously on "The Practice"

00:02.936 --> 00:04.237
NANCY: The kids aren't yours.

00:04.270 --> 00:04.938
They're Richard's.

00:04.971 --> 00:05.606
Nancy.

00:05.639 --> 00:06.507
What?

00:06.540 --> 00:07.508
NANCY: So drop this case

00:07.541 --> 00:09.009
or you'll never see them again.

00:09.042 --> 00:10.043
(doorbell dings)

00:10.076 --> 00:11.411
Roland.

00:11.444 --> 00:13.714
I think I need a lawyer.

00:13.747 --> 00:15.849
SHORE: Not guilty
by reason of automatism.

00:15.882 --> 00:17.250
"Auto-matism"?

00:17.283 --> 00:18.251
SHORE: It's actually one word,
Your Honor.

00:18.284 --> 00:20.186
It basically means my client
was not in control

00:20.220 --> 00:21.087
of his actions.

00:21.121 --> 00:22.823
Well, I won't let you
argue that.

00:22.856 --> 00:24.891
SHORE: Deny my defense,
I'll get you tossed

00:24.925 --> 00:26.392
for abuse
of judicial discretion,

00:26.426 --> 00:27.561
and we can be done
with each other.

00:27.594 --> 00:29.596
Oh, you won't be done
with me, Mr. Shore.

00:29.630 --> 00:30.964
I assure you.

00:30.997 --> 00:34.467
Our plea is not guilty
by reason of automatism.

00:34.501 --> 00:35.969
Deal with it.

00:36.970 --> 00:41.074
How do you mistakenly
use my toothbrush?

00:41.107 --> 00:42.308
It is my toothbrush,

00:42.342 --> 00:44.477
used to clean my mouth,

00:44.511 --> 00:46.412
and I like the bristle dry.

00:46.446 --> 00:47.648
I never said
it was such a big deal--

00:47.681 --> 00:48.982
I can promise you

00:49.015 --> 00:51.552
that your bristle
won't be getting wet tonight.

00:52.185 --> 00:54.821
FOX: You have a new client,
Mr. Young.

00:54.855 --> 00:56.122
His name is Jonathan Macklin.

00:56.156 --> 00:57.724
Jon Macklin is a racist.

00:57.758 --> 00:59.425
Also a defendant.

00:59.459 --> 01:00.567
YOUNG: And a white supremacist.

01:00.601 --> 01:02.402
The victim was black.

01:02.435 --> 01:05.004
My mission is to help people
to improve their lives.

01:05.038 --> 01:06.106
White people.

01:06.139 --> 01:07.307
My people.

01:07.340 --> 01:09.576
The shooter says
you ordered him to kill.

01:09.609 --> 01:12.779
MACKLIN: The shooter came to us
as a runaway.

01:12.813 --> 01:13.880
He said my mission

01:13.914 --> 01:15.582
was to eliminate
Mr. Coleman.

01:15.616 --> 01:16.917
Did you question it?

01:16.950 --> 01:18.118
No.

01:18.151 --> 01:19.319
Why not?

01:19.352 --> 01:20.787
He had a great love
for me.

01:20.821 --> 01:22.455
He still does,
I believe,

01:22.488 --> 01:25.859
just as I continue
to have great love for him.

01:25.892 --> 01:27.027
Is it possible this boy

01:27.060 --> 01:28.929
has homosexual feelings
towards you?

01:28.962 --> 01:32.265
There's no homosexuality
in my Church, Mr. Young.

01:32.298 --> 01:34.000
Your client ordered
an execution.

01:34.034 --> 01:35.636
The most he will serve
is 10 years.

01:35.669 --> 01:38.304
It seems like a fair offer,
Mr. Young.

01:38.338 --> 01:40.073
There won't be any plea.

01:41.374 --> 01:42.442
Mr. Young,

01:42.475 --> 01:45.512
you and I need to get
on the same side now.

01:45.546 --> 01:47.247
Mr. Macklin,

01:47.280 --> 01:50.684
I will give you
the best defense I can,

01:50.717 --> 01:53.754
but you and I will never be
on the same side.

01:58.291 --> 02:00.734
What kind of business
was your dad in?

02:00.767 --> 02:02.803
COLEMAN: Commercial real estate.

02:02.836 --> 02:04.237
He would buy properties

02:04.270 --> 02:05.906
then try to flip them
for a profit.

02:05.939 --> 02:07.708
And at some point,

02:07.741 --> 02:08.709
he bought the building

02:08.741 --> 02:10.544
where the defendant
had his Church.

02:10.577 --> 02:11.477
COLEMAN: Yes.

02:11.512 --> 02:14.147
He knew about
Mr. Macklin's organization.

02:14.180 --> 02:15.682
Institutional racism,

02:15.716 --> 02:17.416
that's what he called it.

02:17.450 --> 02:18.885
He said it was up
to people like us

02:18.918 --> 02:20.153
to do something about it.

02:20.186 --> 02:22.523
So, what exactly did he do?

02:22.556 --> 02:24.257
Well, after he bought
the building,

02:24.290 --> 02:26.927
he served a notice of eviction
to Mr. Macklin

02:26.960 --> 02:28.328
to get his Church out of there.

02:28.361 --> 02:29.696
And what happened?

02:29.730 --> 02:33.266
Mr. Macklin went to Court
to fight the eviction.

02:33.299 --> 02:34.901
He lost.

02:34.935 --> 02:36.102
And then?

02:36.136 --> 02:39.506
Mr. Macklin came up to my dad
in the Courtroom

02:39.540 --> 02:41.775
and said...

02:41.808 --> 02:42.876
that it wasn't over.

02:44.978 --> 02:45.612
He just kept saying that.

02:45.646 --> 02:46.813
"It isn't over."

02:49.282 --> 02:52.819
The next day,
my dad was shot dead

02:52.853 --> 02:54.220
right in front of me.

02:54.254 --> 02:57.390
I know that this is difficult,
Mr. Coleman.

02:58.559 --> 03:00.266
Could you tell us
what you saw?

03:01.602 --> 03:03.937
We were leaving work.

03:05.639 --> 03:07.373
My dad and I walked out
to his car,

03:07.407 --> 03:10.410
which was out front
like it always is.

03:10.443 --> 03:12.546
And a young man,

03:12.579 --> 03:16.449
a white guy came up

03:16.482 --> 03:17.951
and started shooting

03:17.984 --> 03:19.419
and shooting.

03:19.452 --> 03:22.188
Did he say anything?

03:22.222 --> 03:24.024
Yes.

03:24.057 --> 03:26.326
After the gun was empty,
he turned to me and said,

03:26.359 --> 03:29.162
"Courtesy of Jon Macklin."

03:33.166 --> 03:36.102
(music playing)

04:10.911 --> 04:12.979
YOUNG: Next up is the shoe
to Danny Grant.

04:13.013 --> 04:14.548
Now, there seems
there's no record of him

04:14.581 --> 04:16.315
before 1997.

04:16.349 --> 04:17.983
Do you know
if he has another name?

04:18.017 --> 04:20.153
Many of my people
change their names once--

04:20.185 --> 04:22.322
I can't be concerned
with "many people,"

04:22.355 --> 04:23.189
not at the moment,

04:23.223 --> 04:25.125
only Danny Grant.

04:25.158 --> 04:26.960
This kid could bury you,
Mr. Macklin.

04:26.993 --> 04:28.962
Now, if we could expose
some prior record--

04:28.995 --> 04:31.364
I know
what you're trying to do.

04:31.397 --> 04:34.701
You're trying to expose
a previous homosexual life.

04:34.734 --> 04:37.136
I have no knowledge
of any such history

04:37.170 --> 04:39.238
with Danny Grant.

04:39.272 --> 04:40.641
Do you know anything?

04:40.674 --> 04:43.376
Just that he was a runaway,

04:43.409 --> 04:46.747
who seemed like a terrific kid.

04:46.780 --> 04:48.682
BERLUTI: We need something,
Mr. Macklin.

04:48.715 --> 04:52.018
This kid is the prosecution's
whole case.

04:52.052 --> 04:55.155
Well, I can tell you
that he's a liar,

04:55.188 --> 04:58.825
because I never instructed him
to shoot anybody.

05:01.968 --> 05:02.936
Whose sister?

05:02.969 --> 05:05.739
Richard's.

05:05.772 --> 05:07.107
My best friend,

05:07.140 --> 05:08.374
the man I shot.

05:08.408 --> 05:10.744
Why do you want me to go
see his sister?

05:10.777 --> 05:11.945
ROLAND: Because...

05:14.881 --> 05:17.083
Richard and I grew up
next to each other.

05:17.618 --> 05:19.052
My parents were never around,

05:19.085 --> 05:22.589
so I was pretty much raised
by Richard's family.

05:22.623 --> 05:25.358
And I was very close
to his sister.

05:25.391 --> 05:28.662
I need for you
to say how sorry I am,

05:28.695 --> 05:30.363
how truly--

05:32.766 --> 05:35.035
Would you please
tell her I'm sorry?

05:35.068 --> 05:37.037
Yes.

05:39.806 --> 05:41.975
Are you doing okay
otherwise, Roland?

05:42.008 --> 05:45.478
My head feels funny.

05:45.512 --> 05:48.048
I don't handle loneliness well.

05:51.084 --> 05:52.653
How soon can I get out?

05:55.856 --> 05:57.223
It's gonna take a while.

05:58.458 --> 06:00.433
Can you move my trial date up?

06:00.466 --> 06:03.937
My head feels very funny.

06:05.471 --> 06:08.642
I'm not handling this well.

06:11.011 --> 06:13.446
The Church saved my life.

06:13.479 --> 06:15.081
HILL: Specifically,

06:15.115 --> 06:17.618
what happened when you joined
Mr. Macklin's group?

06:17.651 --> 06:18.852
I went through intake,

06:18.885 --> 06:20.854
just like everybody else.

06:20.887 --> 06:23.524
The first three months
were physical training.

06:23.557 --> 06:26.159
After that, we started classes
with Mr. Macklin.

06:26.192 --> 06:27.327
What kind of classes?

06:27.360 --> 06:29.162
History, religion.

06:29.195 --> 06:31.364
He said he had
to reverse the damage

06:31.397 --> 06:32.699
of our government education.

06:32.733 --> 06:35.035
You were trained to fight?

06:35.068 --> 06:37.403
We were trained to stand ready.

06:37.437 --> 06:39.540
We were soldiers
in the divine army.

06:39.573 --> 06:41.207
We could be called upon
at any time.

06:41.241 --> 06:43.176
And did the day come
when you were called upon?

06:43.209 --> 06:44.611
Yes.

06:44.645 --> 06:45.712
When I left camp,

06:45.746 --> 06:47.380
I was assigned
to a recruiting unit.

06:47.413 --> 06:50.016
I went to schools, parks,

06:50.050 --> 06:51.885
looking for newbies.

06:51.918 --> 06:53.987
But when Mr. Macklin
started going to Court,

06:54.020 --> 06:56.389
I got moved
to his security detail.

06:56.422 --> 06:59.025
So you were there the day
the Judge's ruling came in?

06:59.059 --> 06:59.793
Yes.

06:59.826 --> 07:02.002
What was Mr. Macklin's reaction?

07:02.035 --> 07:03.804
He was angry.

07:03.837 --> 07:05.972
I had never seen him so upset.

07:06.006 --> 07:09.643
What happened next,
Mr. Grant?

07:09.676 --> 07:10.911
Back in his office,

07:10.944 --> 07:13.146
he told everyone to get out,

07:13.179 --> 07:14.447
except me.

07:14.480 --> 07:16.550
He said he had a mission for me.

07:16.583 --> 07:19.052
He said the Church looked weak.

07:19.085 --> 07:21.522
People needed to be shown
our vengeance would be swift.

07:21.555 --> 07:22.989
And he assigned me a mission.

07:23.023 --> 07:24.558
What was your mission?

07:24.591 --> 07:26.326
To eliminate Mr. Coleman.

07:26.359 --> 07:28.529
He used those exact words?

07:28.562 --> 07:29.696
Yes.

07:29.730 --> 07:32.432
"Eliminate Mr. Coleman."

07:32.465 --> 07:34.334
And did you, sir?

07:34.367 --> 07:38.204
The next day,
I shot him.

07:38.238 --> 07:40.541
YOUNG: Did you make a deal
with the district attorney?

07:40.574 --> 07:42.976
In exchange for testimony
against my client,

07:43.009 --> 07:45.846
your sentence for murder
would be reduced.

07:45.879 --> 07:47.013
Yes.

07:47.047 --> 07:49.082
But I'm testifying truthfully,
Mr. Young.

07:49.115 --> 07:51.785
Were you testifying truthfully
when you told us your name?

07:51.818 --> 07:54.254
Danny Grant isn't your name,
is it, sir?

07:54.287 --> 07:56.690
It is today and has been
for several years.

07:56.723 --> 07:58.058
Did you change it legally?

07:58.091 --> 07:59.025
No.

07:59.059 --> 08:00.867
Then what's your real name?

08:00.901 --> 08:02.135
Daniel Johnson.

08:02.168 --> 08:04.104
Where are you from,
Daniel Johnson?

08:04.137 --> 08:05.739
GRANT: Philadelphia.

08:05.772 --> 08:08.241
YOUNG: Got a criminal record
as Daniel Johnson?

08:08.274 --> 08:10.744
As a teenager,
I committed a few burglaries,

08:10.777 --> 08:12.412
one assault.

08:12.445 --> 08:13.547
YOUNG: You said
you were assigned

08:13.580 --> 08:15.115
to Mr. Macklin's
security detail.

08:15.148 --> 08:17.217
In truth,
you begged for that assignment,

08:17.250 --> 08:17.884
did you not?

08:17.918 --> 08:19.319
I asked for it, yes.

08:19.352 --> 08:22.222
In fact, you repeatedly asked
for any and every assignment

08:22.255 --> 08:24.457
that brought you in contact
with Mr. Macklin.

08:24.490 --> 08:25.291
Isn't that true?

08:25.325 --> 08:26.927
I was and continue

08:26.960 --> 08:28.962
to be very loyal to Mr. Macklin.

08:28.995 --> 08:30.964
Loyal.

08:30.997 --> 08:32.065
Are you in love with him?

08:36.169 --> 08:37.504
Did you hear my question,
Mr. Grant?

08:37.538 --> 08:39.272
Homosexuality

08:39.304 --> 08:41.975
is against God, Mr. Young.

08:42.008 --> 08:43.544
Yes, terrible,

08:43.577 --> 08:46.847
but are you in love
with Jonathan Macklin?

08:46.880 --> 08:49.249
No, I am not.

08:49.282 --> 08:51.985
Well, did you murder Mr. Coleman
as a means of pleasing

08:52.018 --> 08:54.020
or impressing the man
you were secretly in love with?

08:54.054 --> 08:54.921
No.

08:54.955 --> 08:56.623
Does being gay
make you angry, Mr. Grant?

08:56.657 --> 08:57.658
HILL: Objection!

08:57.691 --> 08:58.659
GRANT: I am not gay.

08:58.692 --> 09:00.166
Does being in love
with Jon Macklin cause you

09:00.200 --> 09:00.934
to have feelings of rage?
GRANT: I am not in love

09:00.967 --> 09:01.968
with Mr. Macklin!

09:02.002 --> 09:03.303
Mr. Young, that's enough.

09:03.336 --> 09:06.139
You say you're a devout follower
of Mr. Macklin.

09:06.172 --> 09:06.940
Yes.

09:06.973 --> 09:08.108
His teachings condemn violence,

09:08.141 --> 09:08.775
do they not?

09:08.809 --> 09:09.710
Yes, but in this particular--

09:09.743 --> 09:10.811
YOUNG: And yet when he suddenly

09:10.844 --> 09:11.878
gives you a mission,

09:11.912 --> 09:13.980
in your mind,
to commit murder,

09:14.014 --> 09:15.248
you just do it.
You don't even question--

09:15.281 --> 09:17.483
I considered Mr. Macklin
to be infallible,

09:17.518 --> 09:19.586
so I fulfilled--
YOUNG: The man says "Eliminate."

09:19.620 --> 09:20.721
You infer "murder"

09:20.754 --> 09:21.955
and you don't even ask
for a clarification as to what--

09:21.988 --> 09:23.423
GRANT: I knew what he meant,
so I continued--

09:23.456 --> 09:25.258
YOUNG: Did he mean for you to
do it in front of an eyewitness?

09:25.291 --> 09:27.427
Did he mean for you to say
to the eyewitness,

09:27.460 --> 09:28.862
"Courtesy of Jon Macklin"?

09:28.895 --> 09:29.796
You framed him then

09:29.830 --> 09:31.031
just like you're framing
him now,

09:31.064 --> 09:31.898
because you're in love with him.
No, I am not.

09:31.932 --> 09:33.066
Objection!

09:33.099 --> 09:35.135
Homosexuality is against God.
FOX: Mr. Young--

09:35.168 --> 09:36.870
You're in love with him,
Mr. Grant,

09:36.903 --> 09:37.871
and you're lashing out

09:37.904 --> 09:39.339
because he doesn't
love you back.

09:39.372 --> 09:40.974
That is not true!

09:41.007 --> 09:42.442
Mr. Young, that's enough.

09:52.185 --> 09:53.353
Okay, you're going
to Philadelphia.

09:53.386 --> 09:54.320
What?

09:54.354 --> 09:55.589
I'll get Jamie
to second chair.

09:55.622 --> 09:56.723
There's something
on this kid, Jimmy.

09:56.757 --> 09:58.925
I know it.
You're going to Philadelphia.

10:14.715 --> 10:16.116
(doorbell dings)

10:26.492 --> 10:28.228
I'm looking for Diane Ward.

10:28.261 --> 10:30.230
I'm her.

10:31.297 --> 10:32.899
Are you the sister

10:32.933 --> 10:35.602
of the late Richard Ward?

10:35.636 --> 10:36.537
Yes.

10:38.004 --> 10:39.540
My name is Alan Shore.

10:39.573 --> 10:42.576
I represent Roland Huff.

10:43.710 --> 10:45.111
May I come in?

10:47.180 --> 10:49.783
What do you want?

10:49.816 --> 10:53.153
Well, uh, Roland asked me
to come here

10:53.186 --> 10:56.990
to convey
his profound sorrow over...

10:57.023 --> 10:58.725
Murdering my brother?

11:00.200 --> 11:01.301
Yes.

11:02.235 --> 11:04.705
Fine.

11:04.738 --> 11:08.441
You've done so.

11:08.474 --> 11:09.843
Good night, Mr. Shore.

11:10.310 --> 11:11.011
Forgive me.

11:14.447 --> 11:17.651
I'm not feeling wholly
satisfied.

11:21.588 --> 11:24.457
I don't, uh, know
whether you've eaten yet,

11:24.490 --> 11:26.593
but if not, may I take you
to dinner?

11:28.529 --> 11:29.730
Why?

11:31.865 --> 11:33.867
I haven't the slightest idea.

11:35.502 --> 11:38.572
I suspect, in part,
because you look like a person

11:38.605 --> 11:40.507
who could use some company.

11:40.541 --> 11:44.044
Forgive me, I don't mean
to be presumptuous.

11:44.077 --> 11:48.281
But also you strike me
as a person

11:48.314 --> 11:52.052
whose company I might enjoy.

12:00.333 --> 12:02.969
MATTHEWS: I did my Graduate
Studies in Sociology

12:03.003 --> 12:04.605
at Northwestern.

12:04.638 --> 12:07.340
My focus is on race
and religion.

12:07.373 --> 12:10.043
And doctor, you're familiar
with Mr. Macklin's Church

12:10.076 --> 12:11.144
of divine power?

12:11.177 --> 12:13.379
MATTHEWS: I've read most
of his writings,

12:13.413 --> 12:14.948
heard tapes of his sermons,

12:14.981 --> 12:16.082
interviewed members.

12:16.116 --> 12:18.719
YOUNG: And were you able
to form an opinion

12:18.752 --> 12:20.921
as to Mr. Macklin's position
on violence?

12:20.954 --> 12:23.189
He's against it.

12:23.223 --> 12:24.758
Don't misunderstand.

12:24.791 --> 12:27.794
There's tremendous hate
in what he teaches,

12:27.828 --> 12:30.897
but his primary goal
is separatism.

12:30.931 --> 12:34.467
He calls
for the black race to fail.

12:34.500 --> 12:37.003
Yes, but I don't believe
it's a call for violence.

12:37.037 --> 12:39.573
I must tell you, doctor,

12:39.606 --> 12:42.342
for an African-American man
to be sitting in that chair

12:42.375 --> 12:43.644
supporting this defendant--

12:43.744 --> 12:45.846
I endorse nothing about the man.

12:45.879 --> 12:47.681
His teachings are racist,

12:47.714 --> 12:49.816
perhaps dangerous.

12:49.850 --> 12:52.853
But there are many prominent
voices in the black community

12:52.886 --> 12:55.121
who support the idea
of separatism.

12:55.155 --> 12:58.358
Segregation required us
to be self-sufficient,

12:58.391 --> 13:00.433
and along with that came

13:00.466 --> 13:03.003
a cultural awareness,

13:03.036 --> 13:06.239
a sense of identity
some think we've lost.

13:06.272 --> 13:09.309
You sound like a separatist
yourself, professor.

13:09.342 --> 13:10.777
I'm not,

13:10.811 --> 13:12.012
but I understand the impulse

13:12.045 --> 13:14.147
to protect your culture,
Mr. Hill.

13:14.180 --> 13:16.817
We're becoming
more diverse every day,

13:16.850 --> 13:18.852
and I think
it's fair to wonder

13:18.885 --> 13:21.154
if by joining others,

13:21.187 --> 13:23.957
we're losing
a little sense of self.

13:40.440 --> 13:41.875
Why are we having lunch?

13:43.544 --> 13:45.245
Did you not enjoy dinner
last night?

13:45.278 --> 13:47.648
I did.

13:47.681 --> 13:49.049
Why are we having lunch?

13:50.651 --> 13:53.053
I just felt I needed
to continue apologizing

13:53.086 --> 13:54.320
on Roland's behalf.

13:57.390 --> 13:59.125
Also, I find you attractive.

14:03.169 --> 14:04.137
Why?

14:04.170 --> 14:07.874
It could be the way
you study me.

14:07.908 --> 14:08.909
You did so yesterday

14:08.942 --> 14:10.511
as soon
as you opened the door.

14:12.546 --> 14:16.349
What is it in particular
that you're drawn to?

14:16.382 --> 14:17.984
Curiosity,

14:18.018 --> 14:20.020
suspicion,

14:20.053 --> 14:21.555
or simply distrust?

14:21.588 --> 14:24.991
I think I enjoy the company
of inquisitive people,

14:25.025 --> 14:26.793
especially
when they're perceptive.

14:29.262 --> 14:33.399
And they often
cause me to...

14:33.433 --> 14:35.268
discover more
about myself.

14:35.301 --> 14:36.770
So, it's all about you?

14:36.803 --> 14:38.672
(chuckles) Perhaps.

14:41.074 --> 14:44.244
And I also find you interesting
in your own right.

14:44.277 --> 14:46.012
So there's that added bonus.

14:49.950 --> 14:50.817
Diane,

14:54.788 --> 14:56.422
would you mind visiting Roland?

14:59.325 --> 15:00.667
From what I gather,

15:00.701 --> 15:04.370
you may be his only semblance
of family.

15:07.674 --> 15:08.942
STRINGER:
As soon as you can, Jimmy.

15:08.975 --> 15:11.645
It's going fast here.

15:11.678 --> 15:13.747
He landed in Philadelphia.

15:13.780 --> 15:15.081
He's on his way to probation.

15:15.115 --> 15:17.250
Well, let's hope
he finds something.

15:17.283 --> 15:18.952
I testify next?

15:18.985 --> 15:20.320
Yes.

15:20.353 --> 15:23.489
The main thing
is to tell the truth.

15:23.524 --> 15:25.926
I plan to.

15:26.960 --> 15:28.795
Look at me, Mr. Macklin.

15:30.363 --> 15:32.465
Do not expend any time
or energy

15:32.498 --> 15:34.735
trying to get the jury
to like you.

15:34.768 --> 15:36.903
That isn't going to happen.

15:36.937 --> 15:38.805
Now, I don't mean
to offend you,

15:38.839 --> 15:41.341
but you need to understand

15:41.374 --> 15:42.509
our chances
have nothing to do

15:42.543 --> 15:45.178
with you coming off as
a sympathetic or likeable guy.

15:45.211 --> 15:48.481
Our defense--our only defense--

15:48.515 --> 15:52.018
is that you did not
commission a murder.

15:53.887 --> 15:55.055
Are we clear?

15:56.790 --> 15:57.824
Yes.

16:00.133 --> 16:02.503
Am I allowed to share
with the jury that I'm afraid?

16:02.536 --> 16:05.506
It won't help.

16:05.539 --> 16:07.140
It's interesting.

16:07.173 --> 16:11.011
You're exploring
Danny Grant's past,

16:11.044 --> 16:13.013
and you've expressed
no interest in mine.

16:13.046 --> 16:16.249
I know who and what you are.

16:16.282 --> 16:19.319
You may know my beliefs,

16:19.352 --> 16:22.956
but you clearly
don't know my heart.

16:25.592 --> 16:27.694
Maybe he's in love with you.

16:27.728 --> 16:29.062
Maybe.

16:32.432 --> 16:34.901
What'd you think
of our expert's testimony

16:34.935 --> 16:37.938
on how interracial relationships
threaten black culture?

16:37.971 --> 16:39.105
What about it?

16:39.139 --> 16:41.007
STRINGER: Well, do you believe
that at all?

16:41.041 --> 16:42.509
YOUNG: Do you?

16:42.543 --> 16:45.546
Well, I mean,
if all the races became one,

16:45.579 --> 16:47.480
it'd be great for world harmony,

16:47.514 --> 16:50.483
but the culture won't be black.

16:50.517 --> 16:51.985
Does that bother you?

16:52.018 --> 16:53.720
Clearly, it bothers you.

16:53.754 --> 16:56.757
You're being evasive.

16:56.790 --> 16:58.992
I was reading this book,
"The Cornel West Reader."

16:59.025 --> 16:59.726
Since when?

16:59.760 --> 17:01.434
Since 6:00.

17:01.467 --> 17:04.104
And he talks about
black cultural distinctiveness,

17:04.137 --> 17:07.907
black manners,
styles, rhythms,

17:07.941 --> 17:10.810
ways of praying
and singing.

17:10.844 --> 17:12.579
What a rich culture.

17:14.146 --> 17:16.916
To think it could be assimilated
into White America.

17:16.950 --> 17:20.420
Are you talking
generally, Jamie,

17:20.453 --> 17:24.156
or is this discussion
honing in on you and me?

17:28.161 --> 17:29.530
(horn buzzes)

17:36.269 --> 17:36.937
Roland?

17:36.970 --> 17:39.205
You need to get me out.

17:39.239 --> 17:42.108
WILSON: Roland,
we've talked about this.

17:42.142 --> 17:44.645
You need--
I can't wait, Tara.

17:44.678 --> 17:46.312
They're watching me.

17:46.346 --> 17:48.949
They have a guard watching me.

17:48.982 --> 17:50.350
Okay.

17:50.383 --> 17:51.451
Roland,

17:51.484 --> 17:55.021
you made a noose
out of your bed sheets.

17:57.758 --> 17:59.793
Do you wanna take
your life, Roland?

18:01.167 --> 18:03.369
They refuse
to come visit me.

18:03.403 --> 18:04.671
Who?

18:05.539 --> 18:07.574
My children.

18:07.608 --> 18:10.711
They say I--
I'm not their father.

18:15.381 --> 18:19.853
My life, Mr. Shore,

18:19.886 --> 18:22.556
was Nancy and Richard
and my children.

18:22.589 --> 18:24.658
They're all gone.

18:24.691 --> 18:26.560
There's no life left to take.

18:28.929 --> 18:31.064
I'm not a loner.

18:31.097 --> 18:32.833
I need people in my life.

18:32.866 --> 18:33.634
I--

18:35.301 --> 18:36.770
Do you have other family?

18:36.803 --> 18:37.604
What about your parents?

18:37.638 --> 18:38.605
They're dead.

18:41.007 --> 18:43.409
Okay.

18:43.443 --> 18:45.679
What needs to happen,
Roland,

18:45.712 --> 18:48.314
is for you to start
building a new life.

18:48.348 --> 18:49.983
We're gonna help you do that.

18:51.484 --> 18:53.419
I met with Richard's sister,
Diane.

18:53.453 --> 18:54.521
She's going to come visit.

18:54.555 --> 18:57.524
I cannot exist in prison.

18:57.558 --> 19:00.534
I know things about myself.

19:00.567 --> 19:03.704
I cannot exist in prison.

19:12.045 --> 19:13.947
YOUNG: We're running out
of time, Jimmy.

19:13.980 --> 19:17.217
I mean, how many addresses
have you checked out?

19:17.250 --> 19:18.018
All right.

19:18.051 --> 19:20.153
Well, keep going and hurry.

19:23.724 --> 19:25.158
Okay.

19:26.893 --> 19:28.795
What's the problem?

19:28.829 --> 19:29.730
What problem?

19:29.763 --> 19:32.866
Doors slamming, dishes clanking.

19:32.899 --> 19:34.400
What's the issue?

19:34.434 --> 19:35.636
STRINGER: You're black.

19:35.669 --> 19:38.238
I'm white.

19:38.271 --> 19:41.742
For you to consider it
such a non-issue,

19:41.775 --> 19:43.009
I just don't get it.

19:43.043 --> 19:44.110
That's all.

19:44.144 --> 19:45.879
Clearly,
it's an issue with you.

19:45.912 --> 19:48.649
So, let's have it.

19:48.682 --> 19:51.417
My issue

19:51.451 --> 19:53.053
is your denial.

19:54.054 --> 19:57.423
You wouldn't be in any denial
yourself then, huh?

20:02.435 --> 20:05.371
Are you?

20:05.405 --> 20:07.307
I don't think so.

20:07.340 --> 20:09.042
I'm the one raising it.

20:10.176 --> 20:11.111
But why?

20:12.746 --> 20:14.948
Ellenor, would you date
a black man?

20:14.981 --> 20:17.483
Yes.

20:17.518 --> 20:18.885
And I have.

20:18.919 --> 20:22.556
Would you marry a black man?

20:23.824 --> 20:26.627
Would there be a reason
I shouldn't?

20:35.669 --> 20:36.837
(door knock)

20:38.171 --> 20:38.872
(door opens)

20:39.472 --> 20:40.741
BERLUTI: Hello.

20:40.774 --> 20:43.176
I'm looking
for a Bernice Johnson.

20:43.209 --> 20:45.646
Do I look like Bernice to you?

20:46.312 --> 20:47.013
No.

20:47.047 --> 20:48.481
Does she live here?

20:48.515 --> 20:50.684
Not anymore.

20:50.717 --> 20:52.719
Do you know where
I might find her?

20:52.753 --> 20:54.988
You got 50 bucks?

20:57.490 --> 21:00.634
My mission
has always been clear,

21:00.667 --> 21:03.504
to reclaim strength
for the white race.

21:03.537 --> 21:06.039
Okay, that's politics,

21:06.072 --> 21:07.340
but we're sitting
in a room today

21:07.373 --> 21:08.642
because someone was murdered.

21:08.675 --> 21:12.312
Which I was not involved in.

21:12.345 --> 21:15.982
I've never supported violence,
even in theory.

21:16.016 --> 21:18.585
I did not endorse
the murder of Mr. Coleman

21:18.619 --> 21:19.953
or anyone else.

21:19.986 --> 21:21.655
Danny Grant said you did.

21:21.688 --> 21:25.191
Danny Grant is either mistaken
or he is a liar.

21:25.225 --> 21:26.993
I can only surmise
that he did

21:27.027 --> 21:29.630
what he thought
would please me.

21:29.663 --> 21:32.332
I'd suffered
a very public defeat in Court.

21:32.365 --> 21:33.499
I was angry.

21:33.534 --> 21:37.203
Perhaps he decided
to avenge that defeat.

21:37.237 --> 21:39.272
If so, he chose a manner

21:39.305 --> 21:41.474
I find deplorable.

21:41.508 --> 21:45.579
Did you ever tell Mr. Grant
to eliminate Mr. Coleman?

21:45.612 --> 21:48.248
No, I did not.

21:48.281 --> 21:51.017
I did say,
after losing in Court,

21:51.051 --> 21:53.419
"These defeats are unacceptable.

21:53.453 --> 21:56.657
We cannot allow for people
such as Mr. Coleman

21:56.690 --> 21:58.191
to undermine our cause."

21:58.224 --> 21:59.626
That's what I said,

21:59.660 --> 22:01.602
my precise words.

22:04.838 --> 22:06.172
Now, here's a quote

22:06.206 --> 22:08.742
from one of your sermons.

22:08.775 --> 22:10.744
"The tree of liberty
must be refreshed

22:10.777 --> 22:14.681
from time to time
with the blood of patriots."

22:14.715 --> 22:15.682
Did you say that?

22:15.716 --> 22:17.851
I was quoting
Thomas Jefferson.

22:17.884 --> 22:20.220
Thomas Jefferson
was discussing a revolution.

22:20.253 --> 22:21.622
So was I,

22:21.655 --> 22:23.289
a nonviolent one.

22:23.323 --> 22:26.527
Nonviolent with blood.

22:26.560 --> 22:29.796
It's a figure of speech,
a speech made

22:29.830 --> 22:32.465
by one of the founding fathers
of our country.

22:32.498 --> 22:34.735
Oh, so you are a fan

22:34.768 --> 22:36.002
of Thomas Jefferson's?

22:37.638 --> 22:38.872
In another sermon,

22:38.905 --> 22:40.574
you condemned his soul to hell.

22:40.607 --> 22:42.208
My condemnation
there was aimed

22:42.242 --> 22:44.578
at reports that he had
had sexual relations

22:44.611 --> 22:45.879
with one of his slaves.

22:45.912 --> 22:47.113
A black slave?

22:47.147 --> 22:49.082
It's against God.

22:49.115 --> 22:51.084
What do you think
of homosexuality?

22:52.719 --> 22:55.789
That, too,
is against God.

22:55.822 --> 22:56.957
HILL: In fact,

22:56.990 --> 22:59.325
you condemned homosexuality

22:59.359 --> 23:01.467
in a sermon two years ago,
did you not?

23:01.502 --> 23:04.037
I have done so many times.
HILL: Yes.

23:04.070 --> 23:07.473
Well, the day after this time,

23:07.508 --> 23:10.143
two of your parishioners
beat a gay man half to death.

23:10.176 --> 23:11.745
Objection, prejudicial.

23:11.778 --> 23:13.146
HILL: And now they sit
in prison--

23:13.179 --> 23:15.348
MACKLIN: I never ordered them
to do that.

23:15.381 --> 23:16.850
They just got it wrong?

23:16.883 --> 23:17.951
Yes.

23:17.984 --> 23:19.653
Like Danny Grant
got it wrong when,

23:19.686 --> 23:21.487
after a conversation with you,

23:21.522 --> 23:23.489
he killed Arnold Coleman?

23:23.524 --> 23:25.291
Yes.

23:37.070 --> 23:39.740
Bail for a double-homicide case?

23:39.773 --> 23:41.274
SHORE: Your Honor,
in addition to my client

23:41.307 --> 23:42.342
having no prior record.

23:42.375 --> 23:44.811
I don't particularly care.
And roots in the community

23:44.845 --> 23:46.513
and posing very little
flight risk,

23:46.547 --> 23:48.882
his trial is scheduled
for next week.

23:48.915 --> 23:51.752
His emotional stability
is being jeopardized

23:51.785 --> 23:53.119
by his ongoing confinement.

23:53.153 --> 23:56.322
You have a medical affidavit
confirming as much.

23:56.356 --> 23:59.359
I would submit to ensure
Mr. Huff's ability

23:59.392 --> 24:01.535
to competently contribute
to his defense--

24:01.568 --> 24:02.736
HARROD: Counsel,

24:02.769 --> 24:05.371
the man shot two people.

24:05.405 --> 24:08.642
You are claiming automatism
as a defense.

24:08.675 --> 24:11.211
How can I release a guy
who can't control himself?

24:11.244 --> 24:12.713
That breakdown was triggered

24:12.746 --> 24:14.915
by a very specific event.

24:14.948 --> 24:17.083
He discovered
his lifelong best friend

24:17.117 --> 24:18.384
in bed with his wife.

24:18.418 --> 24:20.120
My client has no
more best friends.

24:20.153 --> 24:21.522
He has no more wives.

24:21.555 --> 24:23.690
The situation isn't
likely to repeat itself.

24:23.724 --> 24:25.792
You know what
your problem is, counsel?

24:25.826 --> 24:27.794
You ooze smug.

24:27.828 --> 24:29.763
I don't like smug.

24:29.796 --> 24:32.465
Your Honor,
this is Diane Ward.

24:32.498 --> 24:35.001
She is the sister
of one of the victims.

24:35.035 --> 24:36.570
Even she is here willing

24:36.603 --> 24:38.071
to extend some compassion.

24:38.104 --> 24:40.106
This forum isn't
about indulging tears

24:40.140 --> 24:41.642
or compassion

24:41.675 --> 24:44.745
or some misplaced
self-righteousness, counsel.

24:44.778 --> 24:47.514
It's about enforcing
the letter of the law.

24:47.548 --> 24:48.782
Under the law,

24:48.815 --> 24:50.250
I do not grant bail

24:50.283 --> 24:52.352
to double-homicide defendants.

24:52.385 --> 24:53.987
Your motion is denied.

24:55.121 --> 24:57.223
The defendant goes back
into custody.

24:57.758 --> 24:58.525
(gavel bangs)

25:05.071 --> 25:06.472
I'm sorry.

25:06.507 --> 25:08.041
Try to stay strong, Roland.

25:08.074 --> 25:09.442
It's only a week
till the trial.

25:09.475 --> 25:10.544
I don't know
if I can make it.

25:10.577 --> 25:11.477
SHORE: Yes, you can.

25:11.512 --> 25:13.446
Yes, you can.

25:13.479 --> 25:16.449
(indistinct chatter)

25:16.482 --> 25:19.419
(music playing)

25:33.433 --> 25:34.300
(door opens)

25:35.368 --> 25:37.270
STRINGER: All set?

25:37.303 --> 25:37.971
One second.

25:46.046 --> 25:47.313
Something on your mind, Jamie?

25:57.323 --> 26:00.233
I'm Jewish,
which you know...

26:01.401 --> 26:02.669
A half-Jewish.

26:03.403 --> 26:04.538
By blood.

26:04.571 --> 26:06.072
I was raised Jewish.

26:06.106 --> 26:08.041
I consider myself Jewish.

26:10.410 --> 26:11.277
Okay.

26:11.311 --> 26:12.513
And?

26:12.546 --> 26:16.382
And the Jewish culture

26:16.416 --> 26:17.551
is being threatened

26:17.584 --> 26:19.319
by intermarriage.

26:19.352 --> 26:22.188
And, well, the truth is...

26:22.222 --> 26:23.824
as I look to my future,

26:27.427 --> 26:29.162
I don't see myself sharing it

26:29.195 --> 26:31.231
with someone who's not Jewish.

26:34.701 --> 26:35.802
(scoffs)

26:37.704 --> 26:39.039
Jamie, if you want out,

26:39.072 --> 26:40.607
just say you want out,

26:40.641 --> 26:42.442
but don't invent some
religious reason

26:42.475 --> 26:44.578
for why we have--
STRINGER: I'm not inventing.

26:49.282 --> 26:53.019
Fine. You're Jewish.

26:53.053 --> 26:54.220
You want out.
We're done.

26:57.423 --> 26:58.825
Anything else?

27:04.070 --> 27:05.972
You have an odd little house.

27:07.941 --> 27:10.043
Can I get you a cup
of coffee or--

27:10.076 --> 27:11.778
SHORE: No, I better get going.

27:13.580 --> 27:16.349
As I told you, I have a trial
rapidly approaching.

27:19.119 --> 27:21.387
Diane, would you perhaps
consider testifying

27:21.421 --> 27:22.856
on Roland's behalf?

27:24.457 --> 27:25.759
Are you using me?

27:28.061 --> 27:29.329
I'm not sure.

27:30.997 --> 27:32.866
I am very drawn to you.

27:34.134 --> 27:37.070
But can I separate
my fascination

27:37.103 --> 27:39.906
from my need to have you
at trial for Roland?

27:39.940 --> 27:40.874
I'm not sure.

27:44.077 --> 27:46.547
When you said before
I was an attractive woman--

27:46.580 --> 27:49.249
I said that
because I find you attractive.

27:55.421 --> 27:56.990
Would you sleep with me tonight?

27:59.159 --> 28:00.433
I mean, we don't have
to be physical.

28:00.466 --> 28:02.302
I...

28:02.335 --> 28:05.138
I would just really like
to fall asleep

28:05.171 --> 28:06.439
next to somebody.

28:07.808 --> 28:09.976
It's been so long since--

28:19.152 --> 28:21.888
I would very much like
to sleep with you tonight,

28:24.224 --> 28:26.527
but it could render
you impeachable.

28:33.567 --> 28:35.569
I think Roland was abused

28:35.602 --> 28:37.370
by his father,

28:37.403 --> 28:39.105
if that helps with his trial.

28:39.139 --> 28:40.774
Sexually abused?

28:40.807 --> 28:42.142
Yes.

28:42.175 --> 28:43.744
And his mother's an alcoholic,

28:43.777 --> 28:45.211
if that counts for anything.

28:45.245 --> 28:47.147
He said his family was dead.

28:47.180 --> 28:48.682
Well, they may as well be.

28:50.483 --> 28:52.519
His mother's never sober.

28:52.553 --> 28:54.621
And his father
is a Croatian diplomat

28:54.655 --> 28:57.157
who's almost always
out of the country.

28:57.190 --> 29:00.834
That's why he has so many
issues about being alone.

29:00.867 --> 29:02.435
His parents were gone, really.

29:04.470 --> 29:06.406
Will this be helpful
at his trial?

29:09.409 --> 29:11.077
Diane, you have no idea.

29:14.915 --> 29:16.650
DRIVER: Thank you, sir.

29:19.886 --> 29:22.823
(engine revving)

29:32.599 --> 29:35.068
Hello.
My name is James Berluti.

29:35.101 --> 29:37.203
I'm looking for
a Mrs. Bernice Johnson.

29:38.271 --> 29:39.205
Speaking.

29:41.508 --> 29:44.444
I'm looking for the mother
of Daniel Johnson,

29:44.477 --> 29:46.112
now known as Daniel Grant.

29:46.146 --> 29:47.681
Speaking.

29:51.384 --> 29:53.353
I'm looking for the mother

29:53.386 --> 29:54.888
of this man.

29:56.723 --> 29:57.858
Here I am.

29:57.891 --> 29:59.826
Now, what do you want?

30:10.811 --> 30:13.213
Croatian?
Yeah, I need all the research,

30:13.246 --> 30:15.582
Tara, not just--
WILSON: Well, this is all of it.

30:15.616 --> 30:17.618
And here's the statute
followed by the treaty.

30:20.253 --> 30:21.287
What's going on?

30:27.493 --> 30:28.529
What?

30:28.562 --> 30:30.163
Call our Judge, Tara.

30:32.398 --> 30:33.534
Make an appointment.

30:34.400 --> 30:36.269
I don't need to talk to you.

30:36.302 --> 30:38.071
Danny, I just--

30:38.104 --> 30:40.507
Please don't speak to me
in familiar terms

30:40.541 --> 30:43.143
after what your colleague
subjected me to.

30:43.176 --> 30:45.011
Implying I'm a homosexual?

30:45.045 --> 30:47.180
Look, your mother--

30:47.213 --> 30:49.349
She didn't even know
that you committed a murder

30:49.382 --> 30:50.551
or that you were in jail.

30:50.584 --> 30:52.619
What a surprise.

30:52.653 --> 30:54.087
I haven't spoken to my mother

30:54.120 --> 30:56.356
in over five years.

30:56.389 --> 30:58.358
Look, it's not uncommon

30:58.391 --> 30:59.693
for a biracial man

30:59.726 --> 31:01.835
to think of himself as white,

31:02.969 --> 31:05.238
but to become
a white supremacist?

31:07.774 --> 31:10.010
Are you really a white
supremacist, Danny,

31:10.043 --> 31:12.445
or do you consider
yourself black

31:12.478 --> 31:14.414
and you found the perfect way

31:14.447 --> 31:15.982
to take down a racist?

31:18.118 --> 31:20.120
If I were black,

31:20.153 --> 31:22.155
do you really think I'd murder

31:22.188 --> 31:23.757
a black man to make a point?

31:25.325 --> 31:28.261
I killed because I know

31:28.294 --> 31:30.531
it's what Mr. Macklin wanted,

31:30.564 --> 31:32.566
because I'm devoted to him,

31:32.599 --> 31:35.068
because I would do
anything for him.

31:38.438 --> 31:40.641
And I'm not gay,
Mr. Berluti.

31:40.674 --> 31:44.044
Oh, I don't believe
you're gay anymore.

31:46.112 --> 31:48.014
Your mother,
she also gave me

31:48.048 --> 31:49.916
a picture of your father.

31:51.117 --> 31:54.220
She didn't think
you even knew his identity,

31:54.254 --> 31:56.422
but that would be just

31:56.456 --> 31:58.659
too big a coincidence,

31:58.692 --> 32:00.026
wouldn't it, Danny?

32:10.544 --> 32:12.112
My son?

32:12.145 --> 32:13.980
Evidently,
you had a brief affair

32:14.014 --> 32:16.049
with this Bernice 20 years ago.

32:16.082 --> 32:17.984
I never!

32:18.018 --> 32:19.419
BERLUTI: She's positive.

32:19.452 --> 32:21.822
She says this man
is the father.

32:21.855 --> 32:23.223
She's lying.

32:23.256 --> 32:26.292
Mr. Macklin,
this is very good news.

32:26.326 --> 32:27.561
It's new evidence we can use

32:27.594 --> 32:29.295
to impeach Danny Grant.

32:29.329 --> 32:31.497
At a minimum,
we expose a--

32:31.532 --> 32:33.133
MACKLIN: It's a lie
being told by my enemies.

32:33.166 --> 32:34.868
YOUNG: Well, if it's a lie,
it can get you acquitted,

32:34.901 --> 32:35.702
so why don't we--
MACKLIN: No.

32:35.736 --> 32:38.872
I will not let
my enemies destroy me.

32:38.905 --> 32:41.975
I will not let
my attorneys destroy me.

32:43.510 --> 32:45.278
BERLUTI: We're not trying
to destroy you.

32:45.311 --> 32:47.714
We--
This information is false.

32:47.748 --> 32:50.584
You will not present it.

32:50.617 --> 32:53.554
(music playing)

33:06.773 --> 33:08.241
Are you telling me...

33:09.710 --> 33:10.844
you'd rather go to prison

33:10.877 --> 33:12.746
for the rest of your life

33:12.779 --> 33:14.581
than to let it be known
that you have a son

33:14.615 --> 33:16.349
who's half black?

33:16.382 --> 33:19.319
(music playing)

33:28.529 --> 33:31.532
You will not speak

33:31.565 --> 33:33.567
of this information.

33:44.377 --> 33:46.613
I am not pleased
to be back here, counsel.

33:46.647 --> 33:48.615
Actually, Your Honor,
I have splendid news.

33:48.649 --> 33:49.816
I think you'll be delighted.

33:49.850 --> 33:51.552
May I?
Please.

33:51.585 --> 33:53.253
It turns out
Roland Huff's father

33:53.286 --> 33:55.121
is a Croatian diplomat,
and, as such,

33:55.155 --> 33:56.256
is a party to the conventions

33:56.289 --> 33:58.091
and treaties
which grant immunity--

33:58.124 --> 34:00.433
full immunity--

34:00.466 --> 34:02.202
to representatives
of foreign sovereignties,

34:02.235 --> 34:05.639
which--and I apologize
if I'm oozing smug,

34:05.672 --> 34:08.007
but it's just too delicious.

34:08.041 --> 34:11.344
The immunity extends
to children.

34:11.377 --> 34:12.012
Isn't it wonderful?

34:12.045 --> 34:14.114
Roland gets to go free.

34:14.313 --> 34:15.681
What the hell is this?

34:15.716 --> 34:17.283
I suspected you might
be ill-inclined

34:17.317 --> 34:18.318
to accept my word,

34:18.351 --> 34:20.654
so joined with me
is Martin Adler

34:20.687 --> 34:22.188
from the Department of Justice.

34:22.222 --> 34:23.289
ADLER:
Good morning, Your Honor.

34:23.322 --> 34:24.658
I represent the United States

34:24.690 --> 34:26.627
and appear at the request
of the defendant,

34:26.659 --> 34:29.495
but certainly not
in support of him.

34:29.530 --> 34:30.463
Regretfully,

34:30.496 --> 34:33.867
Mr. Huff has two valid
claims of immunity.

34:33.900 --> 34:35.768
He is, in fact,

34:35.802 --> 34:36.803
the son of a diplomat.

34:36.837 --> 34:39.339
He is also listed as a member

34:39.371 --> 34:40.774
of his nation's mission.

34:40.806 --> 34:42.643
You have the declarations
before you,

34:42.676 --> 34:45.277
which, I'm loathe to say,

34:45.311 --> 34:46.446
are in order.

34:46.478 --> 34:48.514
You are here from the Office

34:48.549 --> 34:50.951
of International Affairs

34:50.984 --> 34:52.518
requesting Mr. Huff's

34:52.553 --> 34:54.621
unconditional release?

34:54.655 --> 34:56.623
ADLER: We have contacted
the Croatian government,

34:56.657 --> 34:59.259
urged them to waive
Mr. Huff's immunity.

34:59.292 --> 35:00.967
Unfortunately,
this is a government

35:01.001 --> 35:02.402
that hardly ever does so.

35:02.435 --> 35:04.404
This man shot

35:04.437 --> 35:07.473
and killed two people

35:07.508 --> 35:09.209
in cold blood.

35:10.210 --> 35:11.411
SHORE: The main thing,
Your Honor,

35:11.444 --> 35:13.079
is not to indulge compassion

35:13.113 --> 35:14.314
or tears

35:14.347 --> 35:16.416
or especially
misplaced righteousness,

35:16.449 --> 35:18.451
but simply to enforce

35:18.484 --> 35:20.721
the letter of the law.

35:20.754 --> 35:21.922
You could hold me in contempt

35:21.955 --> 35:23.189
if it'll make you feel better.

35:31.632 --> 35:34.167
I just can't believe it.

35:34.200 --> 35:35.501
I feel like I could cry.

35:36.937 --> 35:38.138
I wouldn't do that.

35:41.107 --> 35:42.175
SHORE: There is a catch, Roland.

35:42.208 --> 35:43.977
You'll need
to leave the country.

35:45.411 --> 35:46.246
What?

35:47.213 --> 35:48.582
And go where?

35:49.282 --> 35:50.183
Croatia.

35:51.652 --> 35:53.019
Mr. Adler over there

35:53.053 --> 35:55.556
and those officers,

35:55.589 --> 35:58.291
they'll be taking you
to the airport,

35:58.324 --> 36:00.466
possibly as early as tonight.

36:00.500 --> 36:02.536
I've never been to Croatia.

36:02.569 --> 36:05.071
Unfortunately,
that's the way the law works.

36:05.105 --> 36:07.473
It's either prison here or...

36:07.508 --> 36:09.843
HUFF: I don't even know
anybody there.

36:09.876 --> 36:11.444
I came here
when I was three.

36:11.477 --> 36:13.479
Roland, you need
to start a new life.

36:14.748 --> 36:15.982
Maybe this is best.

36:18.284 --> 36:19.820
You might not get
the chance to do that

36:19.853 --> 36:21.588
in this country,
not truly.

36:21.622 --> 36:23.456
Yeah.

36:26.860 --> 36:28.328
I'll never see my kids.

36:37.604 --> 36:40.006
I just can't believe
he'd rather face prison than--

36:42.643 --> 36:46.146
How could racism
run so deeply?

36:46.179 --> 36:47.313
You got to be kidding.

36:54.254 --> 36:55.956
It was--

37:02.301 --> 37:04.003
it's not a Jewish thing.

37:06.239 --> 37:07.306
What is it, then?

37:09.576 --> 37:11.277
I adore you.

37:12.746 --> 37:14.581
And I--

37:14.614 --> 37:16.482
but it's...

37:16.516 --> 37:17.951
a man-woman thing.

37:23.089 --> 37:24.625
I wanna break up.

37:26.126 --> 37:29.462
I've, uh,
manufactured...

37:30.897 --> 37:32.198
so many excuses

37:32.232 --> 37:33.967
to conceal the real one.

37:38.739 --> 37:39.973
I'm not interested.

37:45.445 --> 37:47.881
Jamie, you and I,
it's just a thing.

37:47.914 --> 37:49.650
We both know that.
It's no big deal.

37:50.617 --> 37:51.885
It isn't?

37:54.154 --> 37:55.722
Since we work together,

37:55.756 --> 37:57.223
it's probably not
too practical

37:57.257 --> 37:58.559
for us to be, you know--

38:01.234 --> 38:02.468
so let's just move on.

38:02.503 --> 38:05.471
(music playing)

38:17.918 --> 38:19.720
Oh, jury's back.

38:21.454 --> 38:22.689
Let's go.

38:35.536 --> 38:36.637
It's not too late.

38:36.670 --> 38:39.172
I'm in God's hands now,
Mr. Young.

38:41.207 --> 38:42.976
FOX: Madam Foreperson,
I understand the jury

38:43.009 --> 38:43.910
has reached a verdict?

38:45.045 --> 38:46.046
We have, Your Honor.

38:46.813 --> 38:48.649
Will the defendant
please rise?

38:55.889 --> 38:56.890
What say you?

38:56.923 --> 38:59.760
Commonwealth
vs. Jonathan Macklin--

38:59.793 --> 39:01.001
on the charge of murder

39:01.034 --> 39:02.135
in the first degree,

39:02.168 --> 39:04.505
we, the jury,
find the defendant,

39:04.538 --> 39:06.339
Jonathan Macklin,

39:06.372 --> 39:08.141
guilty.

39:08.174 --> 39:09.309
FOX: Members of the jury,

39:09.342 --> 39:10.611
we thank you.

39:10.644 --> 39:12.412
Security,
take the defendant

39:12.445 --> 39:13.547
into custody.

39:13.580 --> 39:14.548
We're adjourned.

39:14.581 --> 39:15.682
(gavel bangs)

39:19.052 --> 39:19.953
I'm sorry.

39:22.022 --> 39:23.557
This is what he intended.

39:24.791 --> 39:25.859
Good luck.

39:25.892 --> 39:27.661
Thank you.

39:29.395 --> 39:30.564
I'll be fine.

39:30.597 --> 39:33.567
