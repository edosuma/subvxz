00:06.274 --> 00:08.409
[female narrator] Previously
on Make It Or Break It:

00:08.442 --> 00:11.079
I don't want us
to be a distraction
before Nationals.

00:11.112 --> 00:12.813
I am so lucky
to have you.

00:12.846 --> 00:15.416
If you want to be friends
with benefits, you know
where to find me.

00:15.449 --> 00:16.584
My mother doesn't
give a crap about me.

00:16.617 --> 00:18.319
[Summer] What is she
talking about?

00:18.352 --> 00:19.587
Lauren's mother is an addict.

00:19.620 --> 00:22.056
She loved getting high
more than her own kid.

00:22.090 --> 00:23.457
[Emily]
You bid on my outfit?

00:23.491 --> 00:26.594
I'll sell it on eBay
when you become a gold medalist.

00:26.627 --> 00:29.197
I left because it was
a better move for me.

00:29.230 --> 00:31.832
I'm gonna be ten times better
without you than
I ever was with you!

00:31.865 --> 00:33.201
Do what you have to do.

00:33.234 --> 00:34.468
Goodbye, Marty.

00:38.539 --> 00:40.541
[rock music]

00:40.574 --> 00:42.343
[Sasha] All right, now.

00:45.513 --> 00:49.183
If we put that move into your
routine it will lift the
difficulty level to a 6.8.

00:49.217 --> 00:51.585
- That's as high as Payson's.
- That's as high as anybody's.

00:51.619 --> 00:54.855
With this routine, we could
win it all at Nationals.
Ready to do another?

00:54.888 --> 01:00.261
Did you see? Sasha just put
a layout layout in
Lauren's routine.

01:00.294 --> 01:03.164
Yup. Looks like
she's ready for it.

01:03.197 --> 01:07.301
Uh, you're not at all nervous?
Her D.O.D. is probably as high
as yours now.

01:07.335 --> 01:09.137
Nationals are
three weeks away.

01:10.438 --> 01:12.140
I don't have time
to be nervous.

01:22.250 --> 01:23.284
Sasha.

01:36.230 --> 01:38.532
- You're not ready for that.
- I just landed it.

01:38.566 --> 01:41.202
Barely. Do a double tuck
from now on.

01:41.235 --> 01:43.571
But I need that move if I'm
gonna make it in the top ten.

01:46.674 --> 01:50.611
Emily, you have incredible
natural gifts as a gymnast.
Incredible.

01:50.644 --> 01:53.581
It's amazing you've come
this far without any
real consistent coaching.

01:53.614 --> 01:56.550
I think you'll make
a decent splash at Nationals,

01:56.584 --> 01:58.486
but you're not
top ten material yet.

01:58.519 --> 02:02.390
Marty thought so.
That's why he brought me here.

02:02.423 --> 02:04.425
Marty is no longer here.

02:04.458 --> 02:06.260
Though I am
expecting him momentarily.

02:06.294 --> 02:07.628
What?

02:09.597 --> 02:12.466
[rock music]

02:21.275 --> 02:22.610
Awkward.

02:24.278 --> 02:25.646
What the hell is he doing here?

02:29.583 --> 02:31.685
Do I have to light a fire under
your asses? It's crunch time.

02:31.719 --> 02:32.753
Go!

02:43.697 --> 02:45.366
You haven't aged a bit.

02:46.600 --> 02:47.635
Well, you have.

02:47.668 --> 02:49.637
Guess you're
still hitting the sauce?

02:49.670 --> 02:51.605
I guess you're still hitting on
unavailable women?

02:51.639 --> 02:53.607
Still reeling
from that one, huh?

02:53.641 --> 02:55.543
Maybe a bit, at the time.

02:55.576 --> 02:59.380
But it did allow me more
focus to win four Olympic
gold medals.

03:00.548 --> 03:03.251
So I've decided you're nuts.

03:03.284 --> 03:05.353
Yeah, it is a ballsy idea.

03:05.386 --> 03:07.621
But then, hey,
I thought you had balls.

03:07.655 --> 03:09.657
I don't know what
you have up your sleeve.

03:09.690 --> 03:11.592
What I do know is that
I'm on top of my game.

03:11.625 --> 03:15.363
And they just pulled you
out of the mothballs.

03:15.396 --> 03:16.630
[chuckling]

03:16.664 --> 03:20.401
We accept your offer.
It's on.

03:27.575 --> 03:29.577
[Sasha] Gather 'round.

03:33.281 --> 03:37.351
I took the job of bringing
this club to Nationals in
under the span of two months.

03:37.385 --> 03:39.320
It's a big risk.

03:39.353 --> 03:41.289
You're a fine club, you are.

03:41.322 --> 03:43.657
But you need more confidence,

03:43.691 --> 03:46.627
more motivation,
more momentum,

03:46.660 --> 03:48.662
if you're gonna
win at Nationals.

03:48.696 --> 03:51.299
And, well,

03:51.332 --> 03:55.269
just as I took a big gamble
in coming here, I have decided
to double down on that gamble.

03:55.303 --> 03:58.839
I've invited Denver
to an invitational here,
and they have accepted.

04:00.608 --> 04:02.543
This is high stakes
poker, ladies.

04:02.576 --> 04:05.746
We are the two best
clubs in America.

04:05.779 --> 04:08.416
The eyes of the entire
gymnastics world will be
upon us.

04:08.449 --> 04:11.519
If we beat Denver,
we'll go to Nationals
with an overwhelming advantage.

04:11.552 --> 04:13.621
We'll be seen
as a superior club.

04:13.654 --> 04:15.589
But if we lose to Denver...

04:17.558 --> 04:20.828
We won't lose. We can't lose.

04:20.861 --> 04:23.697
So what do you say?
You up for the challenge?

04:23.731 --> 04:26.567
[all] Yes, Sasha.

04:26.600 --> 04:28.702
I'm sorry, what was that?

04:28.736 --> 04:30.704
Yes, Sasha!

04:30.738 --> 04:33.674
Now, that's the level
of enthusiasm and confidence
I'm looking for,

04:33.707 --> 04:36.310
and with that,
I know we can beat Denver.

04:36.344 --> 04:38.446
All right, we got work to do.
Back to work.

04:38.479 --> 04:40.314
Let's go.

04:43.484 --> 04:44.518
Belov...

04:46.454 --> 04:48.756
I forgot to mention
one little thing.

04:48.789 --> 04:51.492
The Denver Club
has Kelly Parker now.

04:53.627 --> 04:56.597
Best gymnast in the country.
She just joined last week.

04:56.630 --> 05:01.502
It's amazing timing.
Anyway, cheerio.

05:06.774 --> 05:08.676
Kelly Parker?

05:29.597 --> 05:32.733
[rock music]

05:35.869 --> 05:39.607
I can't believe Denver
has Kelly Parker now.
We're screwed.

05:39.640 --> 05:42.376
Is she as full of herself
as she comes off in interviews?

05:42.410 --> 05:43.477
Oh, worse.

05:44.845 --> 05:47.648
Since she won Nationals last
year she's become quite
the celebralete.

05:47.681 --> 05:50.651
She's practically at every film
premiere and night club opening.

05:50.684 --> 05:52.786
And she's launching
her own cosmetics line.

05:52.820 --> 05:55.789
And they're paying her
a ga-zillion dollars.

05:55.823 --> 05:58.626
Beautiful, rich,
and number one in the country.

05:58.659 --> 05:59.693
- I hate her.
- I hate her.

05:59.727 --> 06:00.728
I'm not scared
of Kelly Parker.

06:00.761 --> 06:03.664
I'm training my ass off
all year just to beat her.

06:03.697 --> 06:06.667
The most important thing
is we win as a team.

06:06.700 --> 06:10.638
We have to go to Nationals with
the world knowing we're the
number one club in the country.

06:10.671 --> 06:14.608
Yeah, well, according to Sasha,
I'm not ready for prime time.

06:14.642 --> 06:16.677
Even though he's barely
pays attention to me.

06:20.948 --> 06:24.885
Well, he's right.
She's isn't consistent.

06:24.918 --> 06:27.821
Uh, she was consistent enough
to beat you when Marty was here.

06:30.691 --> 06:32.826
So how are things
with lover boy?

06:32.860 --> 06:34.728
Great.

06:34.762 --> 06:36.664
He's amazing.

06:36.697 --> 06:40.000
How many guys would put
their girlfriend's careers
before having sex?

06:42.670 --> 06:46.574
Not many. Unless they're
getting it from somewhere else.

06:46.607 --> 06:49.610
Thanks. That's a really
nice thing to say.

06:49.643 --> 06:52.446
Sorry, but guys are dogs.

06:52.480 --> 06:55.483
Carter's not like that.
He loves me and he
would never cheat on me.

06:55.516 --> 06:59.720
And if he did, he
knows that would be the end.

07:00.954 --> 07:02.656
You sure he knows that?

07:04.024 --> 07:05.659
Positive.

07:17.938 --> 07:21.008
- Could have told me
you were gonna be here.
- It was a last minute invite.

07:23.777 --> 07:24.778
I miss you.

07:24.812 --> 07:27.748
You're sweet, Marty.

07:29.783 --> 07:32.620
Well, if you
ever need a friend...

07:33.621 --> 07:37.858
It's over, Marty.
But thanks.

07:39.527 --> 07:40.561
Yeah, well...

07:50.771 --> 07:53.240
I did the layout layout today
and I landed it perfectly.

07:53.273 --> 07:56.510
- No way?!
- Sasha's upping my degree
of difficulty to Payson's level.

07:56.544 --> 07:58.746
He says my routine
could win it all!

07:58.779 --> 08:00.948
I can't wait to show it off
at the Invitational.

08:00.981 --> 08:04.785
That's awesome!
See, I told you...

08:04.818 --> 08:06.754
I'm gonna say hi to Kim.

08:14.662 --> 08:16.697
So are you psyched out
for this Denver meet?

08:16.730 --> 08:18.566
I guess.

08:18.599 --> 08:20.267
- You know what I'd be
more psyched about?
- Hmm?

08:20.300 --> 08:22.536
Day off with you.

08:22.570 --> 08:24.805
Can't we just run away together
when this is over.

08:24.838 --> 08:28.642
Yeah, right. Explain that
to Sasha and your father.

08:31.612 --> 08:32.980
You wouldn't
cheat on me, right?

08:33.013 --> 08:35.048
To have sex, I mean?

08:37.117 --> 08:39.553
You're the only girl
I want to have sex with.

08:39.587 --> 08:42.656
I don't need
to get it anywhere else.

08:42.690 --> 08:45.959
I know. I'm sorry.

08:45.993 --> 08:47.094
I love you.

08:47.127 --> 08:49.029
I love you too.

08:54.802 --> 08:57.771
I'm just so proud
of you, sweetheart.

08:57.805 --> 09:02.576
O-12.
It's gonna be our year.

09:02.610 --> 09:04.878
There's nothing I want more
than to win us an Olympic medal.

09:04.912 --> 09:06.113
Me either.

09:06.146 --> 09:07.848
Really?

09:09.149 --> 09:11.852
Because it doesn't seem like
it means as much to you anymore.

09:11.885 --> 09:13.854
Now that you're
pre-occupied with Summer.

09:13.887 --> 09:17.357
Honey, I can be with Summer
and still give you all
the support...

09:17.390 --> 09:18.959
No, you can't.

09:18.992 --> 09:20.694
I need all of you
to do this.

09:20.728 --> 09:23.664
You can't be a 100 percent
committed to her and me.

09:23.697 --> 09:26.767
- Lauren.
- At least promise me you're
not gonna marry her.

09:28.035 --> 09:29.703
Marriage isn't
even on the table.

09:30.938 --> 09:31.939
Promise?

09:31.972 --> 09:33.674
I promise.

09:37.645 --> 09:39.012
[both make explosion sound]

09:39.046 --> 09:40.914
I can't believe
Kelly Parker is coming here.

09:40.948 --> 09:43.583
Who cares?
We have Payson Keeler.

10:02.736 --> 10:05.939
[rock music]

10:05.973 --> 10:08.041
Hey. Folding boxes?

10:08.075 --> 10:10.778
Yeah, it's kind of
like origami on steroids.

10:11.779 --> 10:13.413
- Here.
- What's this?

10:13.446 --> 10:14.915
Nothing really.

10:22.155 --> 10:25.959
The Stones. Brussels, '73.

10:25.993 --> 10:28.796
- I thought you might dig it.
- Thanks.

10:28.829 --> 10:30.898
"Thanks"? "Thanks"?

10:30.931 --> 10:33.701
[stuttering]
That's what you're giving me?

10:33.734 --> 10:35.769
That's a rare concert,
little miss.

10:35.803 --> 10:40.173
Look, Damon, I just really
need to focus on my gymnastics
right now.

10:40.207 --> 10:45.145
OK, easy, hot shot. I burned
you a CD, I didn't ask you
to marry me.

10:46.479 --> 10:48.749
You're not even my type.

10:48.782 --> 10:50.718
- Your type?
- Yeah.

10:50.751 --> 10:53.453
I like girls that have
been kissed more than once
in their life.

10:53.486 --> 10:57.224
And if you think that buying
that jacket at the fund-raiser
was some grand gesture,

10:57.257 --> 10:59.793
maybe I just
like separates.

11:00.894 --> 11:04.832
Mm-mm! All in favor of self
serve fro-yo, say, "Yo, yo!"

11:04.865 --> 11:06.900
No, thanks, Mom.
Nothing frozen.

11:12.773 --> 11:17.277
Mm-hm, except for
your lower vertebrae.

11:18.812 --> 11:21.114
- You're icing your back?
- It's fine.

11:21.148 --> 11:24.684
Says the kid with the pain
threshold of a gladiator.

11:26.820 --> 11:27.888
It's nothing.

11:28.856 --> 11:30.090
Just a little
tweak on the vault.

11:30.123 --> 11:34.728
This is your disc.
There's nothing little
about an injury there.

11:35.996 --> 11:37.865
- I'm talking to Sasha.
- Mom!

11:37.898 --> 11:40.968
No. No. No.

11:41.001 --> 11:43.871
It's fine. I just need
to rest it tonight.

11:45.072 --> 11:48.241
Trust me, I can handle this.
Injuries are part of the sport.

11:49.810 --> 11:51.945
I know when I can push it
and when I can't.

11:51.979 --> 11:54.748
You're not just pushing through
because of the Invitational?

11:54.782 --> 11:56.850
It's gonna be fine.

11:58.118 --> 12:00.720
You know,
a little vanilla might help.

12:01.789 --> 12:02.756
Mom.

12:04.091 --> 12:05.826
Trust me.

12:11.198 --> 12:13.000
- Pay...?
- Mom.

12:15.803 --> 12:18.538
I'm sorry.
I'm not trying to be a jerk.

12:18.571 --> 12:21.975
I just feel like everything
I've worked for my entire life
is riding on this new coach.

12:22.009 --> 12:24.812
Why am I supposed
to do everything his way?

12:24.845 --> 12:26.279
Is he a clown?

12:26.313 --> 12:28.782
Not exactly.

12:28.816 --> 12:31.785
He's a former
Olympic medalist.

12:32.820 --> 12:35.322
But I have my own
way of doing things, you know?

12:35.355 --> 12:37.791
I have my own style.
It's gotten me this far.

12:38.892 --> 12:42.529
Look, even though I taught
myself three chord structure,

12:42.562 --> 12:44.865
if Keith Richards
walked through that door

12:44.898 --> 12:48.035
right now and offered me tips
on noodling, I'd listen.

12:48.068 --> 12:52.539
Yeah, but we have
a meet coming up,

12:52.572 --> 12:57.344
and if I don't blow it out
of the water then I'm not
gonna get noticed at Nationals.

12:57.377 --> 12:59.079
I just feel like
he's holding me back.

12:59.112 --> 13:01.982
I think if he knows his stuff,
maybe you should trust him.

13:02.015 --> 13:04.551
If you haven't noticed,
I don't do trust very well.

13:04.584 --> 13:07.821
Yeah, well, copy that.

13:07.855 --> 13:12.092
So, can regular people
come to these meets?

13:12.125 --> 13:13.593
Why? You'd wanna come?

13:13.626 --> 13:16.830
Come see you in a leotard?
Hell yeah.

13:16.864 --> 13:18.098
[chuckles]

13:22.602 --> 13:26.373
Yeah. I guess I could use
some moral support.

13:26.406 --> 13:28.275
Good.

13:28.308 --> 13:31.879
I gotta warn you, the morality
of my support is definitely
in question.

13:33.213 --> 13:36.416
[rock music]

13:44.157 --> 13:45.425
Nice, Emily.

13:46.960 --> 13:49.062
Good rhythm.
Keep it steady.

13:49.096 --> 13:50.830
Now the double tuck.

13:53.300 --> 13:56.403
- Excellent!
That's how you do it.
- It feels too easy.

13:56.436 --> 14:00.140
That's the point. Until you can
make it look easy you don't
do it in competition.

14:00.173 --> 14:01.909
Like the full in
back out. Trust me.

14:16.189 --> 14:18.225
How can you act
like the perfect boyfriend

14:18.258 --> 14:21.628
after you seduced your
girlfriend's best friend.

14:21.661 --> 14:24.031
Look, I feel terrible
what happened.

14:24.064 --> 14:27.300
So do I, which is why you need
to break up with Kaylie.

14:27.334 --> 14:28.301
What?

14:28.335 --> 14:29.937
[sighs] Look,

14:29.970 --> 14:32.672
if you break up with her
you never have to tell her.

14:32.705 --> 14:34.041
And she won't hate me
or you.

14:34.074 --> 14:35.909
[sighs]

14:35.943 --> 14:38.311
I love Kaylie. I'm not
breaking up with her.

14:38.345 --> 14:41.314
And I'm telling her
about us after Nationals.

14:41.348 --> 14:43.683
You think after Nationals
it'll be OK?

14:43.716 --> 14:46.186
You're living in a dream world
if you think she'll ever
forgive you.

14:46.219 --> 14:48.455
Think about it, Carter.

14:48.488 --> 14:51.358
Lauren, get back to work.

14:52.960 --> 14:55.662
Look, I know
it's not gonna be easy,

14:55.695 --> 14:58.265
but if you really love her,
you'll let her go.

15:05.372 --> 15:09.409
- You wanted to see me?
- Payson, come in.

15:09.442 --> 15:13.480
Your mother told me your
back injury's flaring up again.
Herniated disc?

15:13.513 --> 15:17.217
I told her it wasn't anything.
She wasn't supposed to tell you.

15:17.250 --> 15:21.488
You should've mentioned it to
me. If your back's that bad you
have to sit out the Denver meet.

15:21.521 --> 15:23.156
I can't sit out a meet
against Kelly Parker.

15:23.190 --> 15:28.261
Everybody's gonna think I'm
scared of her. Why can't
I just get a shot of cortisone?

15:30.097 --> 15:32.966
Those doses need to be spaced
out. When was the last time
you had one?

15:33.000 --> 15:37.337
At least six months.
And don't worry, my parents
are cool with it.

15:37.370 --> 15:39.072
What are we cool with?

15:39.106 --> 15:42.242
Payson says you're OK
with her taking cortisone.

15:43.343 --> 15:45.345
Oh, we are?

15:45.378 --> 15:48.215
Payson, you just had
a cortisone shot two months ago.

15:48.248 --> 15:50.717
It's been longer than that.
Why can't I just get
another one?

15:50.750 --> 15:55.188
Because we have an agreement.
No more than one shot every
six months.

15:55.222 --> 15:59.126
Other parents let their kids do
it all the time. Will you tell
her it's not that big of a deal?

16:03.096 --> 16:05.765
- I'm with
your mother on this.
- I don't believe this!

16:05.798 --> 16:09.536
You're my mom, you're supposed
to be on my side, and you're
holding me back.

16:09.569 --> 16:12.139
Don't you get it?

16:12.172 --> 16:15.442
I'm not trying out for
a cheerleading squad.
I'm trying to make the Olympics.

16:16.576 --> 16:18.545
- Payson...
- Let her cool it off.

16:20.347 --> 16:24.584
What am I supposed to do?
Am I being a horrible parent?

16:25.518 --> 16:28.288
No. But she's got a point.

16:28.321 --> 16:30.557
Being a good parent
of a normal teenager

16:30.590 --> 16:33.460
and being a good parent
of an Olympic gold medalist
isn't always the same thing.

16:34.461 --> 16:35.528
Great.

16:37.230 --> 16:42.602
I still have trouble coming
to terms with the fact that
my 16-year-old has a career.

16:45.238 --> 16:48.241
Look, it's no secret
that I blew my knee out.

16:48.275 --> 16:53.046
Must've had at least five shots
of cortisone in the two months
leading up to the Olympics.

16:53.080 --> 16:56.316
There's no standard,
no protocol. And it's
legal in this sport.

16:56.349 --> 17:01.188
I know, but we thought
it was best if we erred
on the safe side.

17:01.221 --> 17:05.158
There's long term
liver damage if she does
too much of that stuff,

17:05.192 --> 17:07.594
it could weaken her tendons...

17:07.627 --> 17:10.463
Training for the Olympics
isn't always safe.

17:10.497 --> 17:12.399
What are you trying
to tell me?

17:12.432 --> 17:14.101
I'm telling you...

17:16.136 --> 17:18.371
I'm telling you I understand.

17:21.574 --> 17:23.810
Congratulations on
your new degree of difficulty.

17:23.843 --> 17:26.646
What are you
still doing here?

17:28.248 --> 17:30.617
You know, Lauren. I have put up
with a lot of crap from you.

17:30.650 --> 17:35.355
But I can handle it 'cause
I realize now where a lot
of your anger comes from.

17:35.388 --> 17:36.623
I'm not angry.

17:36.656 --> 17:38.291
I would be.

17:38.325 --> 17:42.129
If my mother abandoned me and
if I felt like I was losing
my father to another woman.

17:42.162 --> 17:45.232
Yeah, well, I don't have
to worry about that anymore.

17:45.265 --> 17:49.602
My father told me this morning
that he will never marry you.

17:51.438 --> 17:53.573
Carter? Can I have a word?

17:53.606 --> 17:55.642
Uh... [clears throat] Sure.

17:56.576 --> 17:58.378
Take a seat.

17:58.411 --> 18:00.180
Oh, um, OK.

18:03.650 --> 18:08.155
So I'm gonna make this
short and to the point.
My girls are off-limits.

18:08.188 --> 18:09.822
They don't date.

18:09.856 --> 18:14.127
They don't loiter at the chalk
box, batting their lashes
at the ever so cute gym studs.

18:14.161 --> 18:16.163
They're here to train
for the biggest event
of their lives.

18:16.196 --> 18:19.532
For most of them, this Olympic
cycle is their only chance
to realize their dreams.

18:19.566 --> 18:22.869
As you know, these young women,
they peak in their teens.

18:22.902 --> 18:25.572
You're not gonna peak
until your early 20s.
You have time. They don't.

18:25.605 --> 18:27.407
You need to respect that.

18:27.440 --> 18:29.409
If you don't, your career
at The Rock is finished

18:29.442 --> 18:31.711
and I'll do my personal
best to ruin you.

18:33.346 --> 18:34.681
Are we clear?

18:34.714 --> 18:36.416
Yes, sir.

18:41.188 --> 18:43.323
- Have a good night.
- Bye.

18:50.297 --> 18:52.332
[Alex] You know tomorrow
is a big day.

18:54.601 --> 18:57.537
Kaylie, you're up two pounds.
Come on, it's crunch time!

18:57.570 --> 19:01.541
I know. I'll just stick to egg
whites and ice from now on.

19:01.574 --> 19:03.610
Sweetie,
I understand pressure.

19:03.643 --> 19:08.448
But what separates champions
from those suckers whose names
nobody remembers

19:08.481 --> 19:11.451
is the ability to accelerate
under clutch situations.

19:11.484 --> 19:15.522
Like now.
And you're a champion. OK?

19:17.357 --> 19:19.659
- OK.
- That's my girl.

19:21.628 --> 19:25.498
What's a doctor's scale
doing in my family room?

19:25.532 --> 19:29.369
For motivation. I want Kaylie
to see it, front and center
every day.

19:30.670 --> 19:34.341
Listen, honey,
I was thinking.

19:34.374 --> 19:38.645
It's been a really long time
since you and I went away,
just the two of us.

19:38.678 --> 19:41.748
No, Ronnie, this is no time
to be thinking about a vacation.

19:41.781 --> 19:44.751
We have to focus on Kaylie.
This is everything she's
worked so hard for,

19:44.784 --> 19:46.753
everything she's dreamed of.

19:46.786 --> 19:49.956
Did you ever stop and think
maybe she dreams

19:49.989 --> 19:52.292
of being a real
16-year-old girl

19:52.325 --> 19:54.694
who goes to the prom
and has a boyfriend?

19:54.727 --> 19:56.463
Boyfriends? No.

19:56.496 --> 19:59.366
Kaylie is not like real girls.
She's special.

19:59.399 --> 20:01.768
And quite frankly, if I had
parents who gave a crap
about my dreams.

20:01.801 --> 20:04.237
Maybe things would have
turned out differently for me.

20:04.271 --> 20:05.772
I know, honey, I know.

20:05.805 --> 20:09.309
But Kaylie's not you.

20:09.342 --> 20:10.577
She's not you either.

20:11.811 --> 20:14.447
You forget what it's like to
have a dream, Ronnie?

20:18.585 --> 20:20.353
No.

20:21.688 --> 20:23.556
No, I haven't forgotten.

20:23.590 --> 20:26.426
So Lauren said something
interesting today.

20:27.627 --> 20:29.629
- Oh?
- She said you told her

20:29.662 --> 20:31.531
you were never gonna marry me.

20:31.564 --> 20:34.534
That's just not...

20:34.567 --> 20:36.636
She misconstrued
the conversation.

20:37.637 --> 20:38.605
Did she?

20:40.307 --> 20:43.510
I might have down-played
our relationship a little,

20:43.543 --> 20:45.612
but you know Lauren.

20:45.645 --> 20:48.815
With Nationals coming up, I just
don't want her to lose focus.

20:48.848 --> 20:51.718
There will always be
a Nationals, Steve.

20:51.751 --> 20:54.554
There will always be
a meet or a practice

20:54.587 --> 20:56.556
or an invitational
or an Olympics.

20:56.589 --> 21:00.560
And my life, our life, can't
skid to a stop for each one.

21:00.593 --> 21:02.261
I know,
you're right, but...

21:02.295 --> 21:07.434
Maybe you should be a man, and
stop letting your 16-year-old
daughter call all the shots.

21:10.102 --> 21:13.640
And since you can't, bye, Steve.

21:15.074 --> 21:16.643
Summer...

21:32.592 --> 21:33.726
Will you marry me?

21:33.760 --> 21:35.628
[clapping]

21:47.774 --> 21:51.077
Hey, it's me.

21:51.110 --> 21:53.880
Hi. I...

21:53.913 --> 21:56.616
I thought I'd take you up
on needing a friend.

21:58.785 --> 22:02.422
I know it sounds soppy,
but I would give anything
in the world

22:02.455 --> 22:04.524
to have your arms
around me right now.

22:07.694 --> 22:10.597
I told you it was soppy.
I just...

22:11.931 --> 22:15.435
I don't know why I called.
I just... I was...

22:15.468 --> 22:17.470
I was having a moment.

22:19.739 --> 22:22.375
Yeah. OK.

22:22.409 --> 22:23.810
Good night, Marty.

22:27.580 --> 22:30.617
Kaylie, what...
what are you doing?

22:30.650 --> 22:31.851
What am I doing?

22:31.884 --> 22:35.522
What are you doing telling Marty
you want to be in his arms?

22:35.555 --> 22:37.790
- That wasn't Marty.
- Really?

22:37.824 --> 22:41.528
So if I dialed star 69 right
now, Marty wouldn't answer?

22:41.561 --> 22:43.563
Kaylie, Kaylie,
I'm am sorry.

22:43.596 --> 22:46.666
Oh, my God, Mom.
You and... You and Marty?

22:46.699 --> 22:48.801
- Shh.
- Is that why he went to Denver?

22:48.835 --> 22:53.573
Kaylie, there is absolutely
no excuse for this,

22:53.606 --> 22:58.545
but Marty and I did
have a brief... affair.

22:58.578 --> 23:00.680
But it's... it's... it's over.

23:00.713 --> 23:02.148
It has been over.

23:02.181 --> 23:04.517
How can you do this
to my dad?

23:05.518 --> 23:06.786
How could you
cheat on him?

23:06.819 --> 23:09.656
Honey, I can't imagine
how you feel right now,

23:09.689 --> 23:11.724
but this is between
your father and me.

23:11.758 --> 23:15.462
How, if he doesn't
even know about it?

23:16.863 --> 23:19.799
There's lots of things
your father doesn't know about.

23:19.832 --> 23:21.634
Like you and Carter.

23:37.850 --> 23:39.652
Baby, I'm so sorry.
Are you OK?

23:40.687 --> 23:42.655
I just can't believe it.

23:42.689 --> 23:44.824
I mean, I always thought
my parents were happy.

23:45.892 --> 23:48.595
How could my mother
do this to my dad?

23:49.629 --> 23:50.763
Are you gonna tell him.

23:53.900 --> 23:56.035
I don't see how I can.

23:57.637 --> 23:59.005
My mom knows about us.

23:59.038 --> 24:00.607
Oh, man.

24:00.640 --> 24:03.442
Don't worry, she's not
gonna tell my dad.

24:04.511 --> 24:07.647
I guess she's known
and hasn't told him.

24:07.680 --> 24:09.982
This is just so messed up.

24:13.586 --> 24:14.821
Thank God I have you.

24:18.057 --> 24:22.862
I just...
I feel like you're the only
person that I can believe in.

24:30.770 --> 24:32.071
I just wanted
to give you this.

24:39.278 --> 24:40.980
Carter, it's beautiful.

24:43.550 --> 24:46.052
It was my mother's.

24:55.027 --> 25:00.733
Before she died she told me
to give it to the girl
I wanted to spend my life with.

25:02.334 --> 25:04.003
And that's you.

25:05.972 --> 25:11.077
We don't have to have
everything now...
because we're forever.

25:13.312 --> 25:16.549
If...
that's what you want too.

25:16.583 --> 25:20.787
Yes! Yes, that's all I want.

25:23.690 --> 25:25.958
So, whatever happens,

25:25.992 --> 25:29.729
between now and then.

25:29.762 --> 25:33.733
Don't forget,
you're the one. I love you.

25:35.635 --> 25:38.738
I won't forget.
I love you too.

25:44.877 --> 25:46.879
[rock music]

25:49.816 --> 25:52.685
[announcer] Welcome to
the Rocky Mountain
Gymnastics Invitational,

25:52.719 --> 25:56.789
where The Rock will be facing
off against the Denver Elite
Gymnastics Club.

25:58.758 --> 26:00.960
Pin one of those on me.
I'm good to go.

26:04.396 --> 26:05.632
I trust her.

26:13.005 --> 26:14.040
How does that feel?

26:14.073 --> 26:16.575
Good. So? Can I compete?

26:20.913 --> 26:25.752
Start warming up. But I don't
want you pushing yourself
too hard today.

26:31.023 --> 26:32.725
So you nervous?

26:32.759 --> 26:33.926
I don't get nervous.

26:33.960 --> 26:36.162
But I am a little surprised
to see you here.

26:36.195 --> 26:38.831
I thought, after you found
out my dad wasn't going
to marry you,

26:38.865 --> 26:41.634
you might have a little
self-respect to call it off.

26:41.668 --> 26:45.672
But here you are, still
following him around like
a little stray dog.

26:45.705 --> 26:48.741
Actually, I mentioned
our conversation to
your father last night.

26:48.775 --> 26:49.976
And?

26:50.009 --> 26:52.044
And he asked me
to marry him.

26:53.079 --> 26:55.047
And I said yes.

26:56.716 --> 26:58.150
Good luck out there today.

27:04.924 --> 27:08.728
[announcer] This is four-time
gold medalist Sasha Belov's
first competitive meet

27:08.761 --> 27:11.698
since becoming the new head
coach here at The Rock.

27:18.805 --> 27:23.209
Expecting someone special? Like
the cute band boy who bought
your outfit at the fashion show?

27:24.711 --> 27:25.745
We're just friends.

27:25.778 --> 27:26.846
Right.

27:28.180 --> 27:29.782
[hip hop music]

27:29.816 --> 27:32.952
[announcer] Let's welcome the
Denver Elite Gymnastics Club,

27:32.985 --> 27:37.924
led by reigning Nationals,
Kelly Parker.

27:37.957 --> 27:40.827
Wow. Kelly Parker
is even prettier in person.

27:42.161 --> 27:43.262
And bitchier.

27:45.898 --> 27:48.034
Look at her walk in here
like she owns the place.

27:51.838 --> 27:52.805
Oh, Payson?

27:58.878 --> 28:01.714
I was so looking forward
to kicking your ass at Nationals

28:01.748 --> 28:04.216
but now it's not gonna be
nearly as fun after I kick
your ass here.

28:06.018 --> 28:08.988
You know what's sad
about you? You're a legend in
your own mind,

28:09.021 --> 28:12.124
and while you've been selling
mascara and blush,

28:12.158 --> 28:15.895
I've been training,
day and night.

28:15.928 --> 28:17.730
So we'll see
who gets their ass kicked.

28:17.764 --> 28:18.831
You're cute.

28:18.865 --> 28:20.867
But I'm the reigning
National champion.

28:20.900 --> 28:23.870
I have no intention
of letting you or your
little friends forget it.

28:23.903 --> 28:26.205
[clears throat] You know,

28:26.238 --> 28:28.741
these devil horns
really suit you.

28:28.775 --> 28:30.142
[Sasha] OK, gather
'round.

28:32.845 --> 28:35.314
[announcer] Ladies and
gentlemen, we are about
to get started.

28:39.051 --> 28:41.754
This is it, ladies.

28:41.788 --> 28:45.124
If we're gonna be the team
to beat at Nationals,
we have got to win.

28:45.157 --> 28:48.795
So everyone stay focused,
do the routines as we
practiced them, and we will.

28:49.896 --> 28:52.899
OK. We're on beam first.
They're on vault. Bring it in.

28:53.900 --> 28:55.768
One, two, three.

28:55.802 --> 28:56.869
Rock on!

28:56.903 --> 28:59.171
[rock music]

29:00.840 --> 29:03.810
[announcer] The Rock's Lauren
Tanner, first up on beam.

29:10.349 --> 29:13.920
Reigning National Champion
Kelly Parker, up on vault.

29:13.953 --> 29:18.024
* There's a dark spot
on my hot sun *

29:18.057 --> 29:21.794
* Tell me just what
I have gone and done *

29:21.828 --> 29:24.897
Kelly Parker
sticks the landing.

29:24.931 --> 29:28.234
Up next, newcomer Emily Kmetko
on beam with a split mount.

29:31.237 --> 29:33.840
* I want it here in my head

29:33.873 --> 29:37.810
* You've got no right
to take what's mine
I'm taking it back *

29:37.844 --> 29:42.081
* You're thinking that
my rhythm may be something
you can keep *

29:42.114 --> 29:46.853
* But I'll only let you hold it
It belongs to me *

29:46.886 --> 29:49.321
[announcer] A solid performance
from Miss Kmetko.

29:49.355 --> 29:52.224
Next up on beam, Payson Keeler.

29:52.258 --> 29:56.262
* This drop of sweat
Got what you need *

29:56.295 --> 29:58.364
* Get what you get

29:58.397 --> 30:00.833
* I'm gonna rock you
Roll you *

30:00.867 --> 30:04.103
* Only hold you to the heat
I own the beam *

30:04.136 --> 30:08.074
* With my stone heart
You're such a hard shove *

30:08.107 --> 30:11.944
* Did you really think
that I'd fall in love? *

30:11.978 --> 30:13.980
* You tell a good lie

30:14.013 --> 30:17.316
* Oh, baby, so do I

30:17.349 --> 30:21.888
- Yes!
- Payson Keeler, with the
highest score in first rotation

30:21.921 --> 30:24.156
edging out Kelly Parker
in the individual standing.

30:25.424 --> 30:27.860
Good work. Let's keep this
rolling. We're on floor next.

30:27.894 --> 30:29.261
Kaylie, let's see you shine.

30:31.931 --> 30:35.935
* I own the beam
That's in your head *

30:35.968 --> 30:37.636
* I own the beam

30:37.669 --> 30:39.071
[announcer] At the end
of the first rotation,

30:39.105 --> 30:40.372
The Rock is in the lead

30:40.406 --> 30:42.408
by more than a point
over the Denver Club.

30:42.441 --> 30:45.111
Nice. Good job.

30:45.144 --> 30:49.248
Now, Kaylie Cruz on floor
to start the second rotation
for The Rock.

30:49.281 --> 30:51.017
The Denver Elite are on bars.

30:51.050 --> 30:52.952
* That's right
I'm in the building *

30:52.985 --> 30:55.421
* The warning out
to all male civilians *

30:55.454 --> 30:57.023
* Have you on the ceiling

30:57.056 --> 30:59.191
* When I drop it lower
than Sicilians *

30:59.225 --> 31:01.894
* And if we knock boots
like the shape of Italy *

31:01.928 --> 31:03.295
* It'll be the epitome

31:03.329 --> 31:05.998
Next up for Denver,
Anna Alvarez.

31:08.234 --> 31:10.169
* No imitations
No copycat chicks *

31:10.202 --> 31:11.971
* Packin' ten by Miss '86

31:12.004 --> 31:14.073
* So step to the girl
at your own risk *

31:14.106 --> 31:16.375
* 'Cause I know the killer
gonna put it down like this *

31:16.408 --> 31:18.911
* Migga lang lang lang
Migga lang *

31:18.945 --> 31:20.679
* Jigga lang jing jang
Jigga lang *

31:20.712 --> 31:23.049
* Ding a lang dang dang
Ding a lang *

31:23.082 --> 31:25.051
* Ring a lang lang lang
Ring a lang *

31:25.084 --> 31:27.319
* Ring a lang lang lang
Ring a lang *

31:27.353 --> 31:29.421
* Jing a lang jing jing
Jing a lang *

31:29.455 --> 31:31.123
* Ding a lang ding ding
Ding a lang *

31:31.157 --> 31:33.192
Wooh!

31:33.225 --> 31:37.029
Kaylie Cruz with an impressive
routine on floor.

31:45.704 --> 31:47.373
And now, Kelly Parker
up on bars,

31:47.406 --> 31:48.975
looking to catch
Payson Keeler.

31:50.509 --> 31:52.478
* Migga lang lang lang
Migga lang *

31:52.511 --> 31:54.947
* Jigga lang jing jang
Jigga lang *

31:54.981 --> 31:56.348
* Ding a lang dang dang
Ding a lang *

31:56.382 --> 32:00.452
Last year at Nationals,
Payson Keeler won silver
in this event,

32:00.486 --> 32:03.222
edged out by Kelly Parker.

32:03.255 --> 32:05.457
* Ding a ling ding ding
Ding a ling *

32:05.491 --> 32:07.326
* Ring a lang lang lang
Ring a lang *

32:07.359 --> 32:09.495
* That's right
He catching feelings *

32:09.528 --> 32:12.098
* And the feeling
She's so appealing *

32:12.131 --> 32:15.201
* I learned that from the girls
on the islands *

32:15.234 --> 32:17.503
* I swerve, with a little bit
of every culture *

32:17.536 --> 32:22.474
* Mix six, connected by...

32:22.508 --> 32:25.411
Kelly Parker
with a flawless dismount.

32:27.013 --> 32:29.048
* Jing a lang jing jing
Jing a lang *

32:29.081 --> 32:31.117
* Ding a lang ding ding
Ding a lang *

32:32.751 --> 32:35.387
- [crowd sighs]
- A costly mistake.

32:35.421 --> 32:39.025
Payson Keeler steps out
of bounds on her final pass.

32:45.164 --> 32:50.002
And after the second rotation,
the Denver Club has pulled
ahead of The Rock.

32:50.036 --> 32:53.472
[applause]

32:53.505 --> 32:55.507
Well, old friend.
You ready to fold?

32:55.541 --> 32:56.542
Girls.

33:03.582 --> 33:05.451
We've got some serious
catching up to do, OK?

33:05.484 --> 33:08.020
That means you put everything
you've got into this next vault.

33:08.054 --> 33:09.488
Everything. Understand?

33:14.426 --> 33:17.196
[announcer] Payson Keeler
is up on vault for The Rock.

33:33.479 --> 33:36.548
Beautiful vault.
That will get a big score.

33:45.491 --> 33:49.461
Payson Keeler scoring
a huge 15.700 on vault.

33:49.495 --> 33:52.464
That puts her just ahead of
Kelly Parker in the individual
standings...

33:52.498 --> 33:53.499
You OK?

33:55.101 --> 33:57.503
Pain. Scale of one to ten.
And don't lie to me.

33:58.637 --> 33:59.638
Nine.

34:01.107 --> 34:03.409
Payson, are you OK?

34:05.644 --> 34:08.380
- I'm taking her
out of the competition.
- No!

34:09.381 --> 34:10.616
You can't.

34:10.649 --> 34:15.354
I'm beating Kelly Parker.
I can't quit now.

34:15.387 --> 34:17.489
Payson, you're in
way too much pain
to go out there.

34:17.523 --> 34:19.658
Not if I get
a cortisone shot.

34:22.628 --> 34:24.663
Please, Mom.

34:26.432 --> 34:28.267
I need you to say yes.

34:30.469 --> 34:32.138
OK.
Let's get the shot.

34:33.672 --> 34:35.541
Let's go.

34:38.344 --> 34:40.479
- [announcer] This is
the last rotation.
- Come on, ladies.

34:40.512 --> 34:43.882
The Rock is on uneven bars,
Denver is on floor.

34:43.915 --> 34:46.485
This is it. Let's do
what we came here to do.

34:46.518 --> 34:48.220
Floor is Kelly Parker's
best event.

34:48.254 --> 34:49.355
Yeah? And bars are

34:49.388 --> 34:50.522
about to become ours. Let's go.

34:50.556 --> 34:52.358
[announcer]
Kelly Parker on floor

34:52.391 --> 34:53.525
for the Denver Elite.

34:53.559 --> 34:54.626
* The wheels of the devil

34:54.660 --> 34:55.627
* The wheels of the devil

34:55.661 --> 34:57.529
* Run right over me

34:57.563 --> 35:02.434
* The devil's got my soul
The devil's got my soul *

35:02.468 --> 35:06.472
* The wheels of the devil
got my soul *

35:07.673 --> 35:09.241
* The devil's got my soul...

35:09.275 --> 35:10.609
Band boy a no-show?

35:10.642 --> 35:12.678
I don't know what
you're talking about.

35:12.711 --> 35:16.282
* Wings of an angel
come right over me *

35:16.315 --> 35:18.417
* The devil's got
my soul, I'm afraid *

35:18.450 --> 35:22.354
* Nothing goes for free
The wings of an angel... *

35:22.388 --> 35:24.690
[announcer] Parker performs
a flawless floor routine...

35:24.723 --> 35:27.326
- Beat that, Keeler.
- ...taking the lead
over Payson Keeler.

35:31.630 --> 35:32.898
- Payson...
- Yeah?

35:32.931 --> 35:34.933
This will decide
the all-around winner.

35:34.966 --> 35:40.372
Payson Keeler needs
an almost-perfect score
to beat Kelly Parker.

35:40.406 --> 35:41.940
* Get loose

35:41.973 --> 35:44.176
* Everybody, on the floor

35:44.210 --> 35:48.180
- * Get loose
- * Leave your drama
at the door *

35:48.214 --> 35:51.950
- * Get loose
- * Like you've never
done before *

35:51.983 --> 35:55.921
- * Get loose
- * Feel the music
in your soul *

35:55.954 --> 35:58.557
- * Get loose
- * Our soul is mystical

35:58.590 --> 36:00.659
* So metaphysical

36:00.692 --> 36:05.197
* When rhythm takes control
I am invincible *

36:05.231 --> 36:07.766
[announcer] Keeler sticks it.
That's as good as it gets.

36:12.638 --> 36:14.506
And with the highest
score at the meet,

36:14.540 --> 36:16.408
Payson Keeler
edges out Kelly Parker

36:16.442 --> 36:18.544
for the individual title.

36:21.012 --> 36:23.949
OK, Lauren,
we've got this in the bag.

36:23.982 --> 36:25.484
Just you and Emily left.

36:25.517 --> 36:27.686
No major slip-ups
and we're home free, OK?

36:27.719 --> 36:29.355
Got it.

36:33.392 --> 36:34.760
[announcer] Up next,
Lauren Tanner.

36:34.793 --> 36:37.796
A clean routine could secure
the win for the Rock.

36:56.548 --> 36:58.517
[crowd groans]

36:58.550 --> 37:02.521
[announcer] An unusual error
on a fairly routine move.

37:11.630 --> 37:13.832
She totally had that!

37:14.833 --> 37:16.402
Why'd she let go?

37:50.669 --> 37:53.339
[cheering, applause]

37:53.372 --> 37:55.474
[announcer] A good
recovery for Tanner.

38:01.613 --> 38:03.615
[under breath]
We might be screwed.

38:05.651 --> 38:09.488
OK, Emily,
you do your routine
like we practiced.

38:09.521 --> 38:10.822
No frills.

38:10.856 --> 38:14.593
I can land
the full in back out.
I know I can!

38:14.626 --> 38:19.565
We play it safe.
There's still a chance
we can pull this off, OK?

38:19.598 --> 38:21.667
[announcer]
Up next is Emily Kmetko.

38:21.700 --> 38:23.769
It all comes down
to this final routine.

38:26.505 --> 38:28.507
So I heard she was
someone to watch

38:28.540 --> 38:30.509
but I haven't seen her
do anything out there

38:30.542 --> 38:32.811
- an eight-year-old
couldn't do.
- [both giggle]

38:33.745 --> 38:34.780
Emily.

38:55.801 --> 38:57.403
[groaning, gasps]

38:59.438 --> 39:02.541
[heartbeat]

39:15.754 --> 39:19.758
[announcer] An unfortunate fall
for Kmetko and the team.

39:34.673 --> 39:36.875
And that clinches
the win for Denver.

39:36.908 --> 39:40.512
The Denver Elite club is the
Rock Invitational champion

39:40.546 --> 39:44.583
by less than four-tenths
of a point.

39:44.616 --> 39:47.719
A disappointing loss
for the Rock
on their own turf.

39:51.890 --> 39:53.592
Hey!

39:53.625 --> 39:55.527
What happened to you
out there?

39:55.561 --> 39:58.730
You can do that move
flawlessly. I've seen you.

39:58.764 --> 40:00.599
You taught me
a new move, Daddy.

40:00.632 --> 40:02.468
- What?
- Giving up.

40:02.501 --> 40:04.636
You gave up on our dreams,
so I figured I could too.

40:04.670 --> 40:06.972
- I didn't give up.
- Yes, you did.

40:07.005 --> 40:09.641
When you asked Summer
to marry you last night.

40:09.675 --> 40:13.479
Better watch out, Dad.
I might just give up
on our dream again,

40:13.512 --> 40:16.615
say, in Boston at Nationals.

40:18.216 --> 40:20.552
Well, win some, lose some.

40:20.586 --> 40:22.688
Gambling rarely
pays off, my friend.

40:22.721 --> 40:24.723
I wouldn't say that.

40:24.756 --> 40:26.925
Payson Keeler beat
Kelly Parker one week
before Nationals.

40:26.958 --> 40:28.860
I'd say that's a gamble
well worth it.

40:39.538 --> 40:41.507
You know,
you were right.

40:41.540 --> 40:43.509
Now that I've kicked
your ass here at the Rock,

40:43.542 --> 40:46.444
it's not gonna be
nearly as fun
when I do it at Nationals.

40:51.917 --> 40:54.753
Mom! Did you see that?

40:54.786 --> 40:56.855
- Ooh!
- Did you see it?
I did it!

40:56.888 --> 40:59.491
- Yes!
- Thank you so much
for trusting me, Mommy.

41:13.038 --> 41:14.706
[door opens]

41:18.076 --> 41:19.077
Go home.

41:20.779 --> 41:24.049
Look...
I know you're mad.

41:25.584 --> 41:26.718
You're right.

41:27.819 --> 41:30.522
I should've listened to you.
I shouldn't have done it.

41:31.923 --> 41:34.693
But I thought I had to try
so that we could win.

41:37.328 --> 41:39.731
I promise it'll
never happen again,

41:39.765 --> 41:41.800
especially at Nationals.

41:41.833 --> 41:43.602
I know.

41:47.573 --> 41:49.708
Because you're not
going to Nationals.

41:50.842 --> 41:53.679
- What?!
- You heard me.

41:55.581 --> 41:58.684
- But you can't!
- Go home, Emily.

42:20.606 --> 42:24.743
I'm so stupid!
I never should have gone for it.

42:24.776 --> 42:26.678
So why did you?

42:26.712 --> 42:28.747
I wanted us to win.

42:28.780 --> 42:32.317
I wanted to prove
that I'm better than he thinks.

42:32.350 --> 42:33.652
What a joke.

42:33.685 --> 42:35.754
You are better
than he thinks

42:35.787 --> 42:37.723
and you will
prove it to him.

42:37.756 --> 42:41.760
How? I'm not going
to Nationals.

42:41.793 --> 42:43.762
Of course you are.

42:43.795 --> 42:46.998
Sasha will cool off,
and tomorrow he'll
forget all about it.

42:47.032 --> 42:49.034
No, he won't.

42:49.067 --> 42:51.803
He will never forget.

42:52.771 --> 42:54.606
[knock on door]

42:59.745 --> 43:02.047
Oh! Look who's here.

43:03.815 --> 43:07.686
Well, I'm just gonna
go get ready for bed.

43:11.389 --> 43:13.058
Hey. How was the meet?

43:14.760 --> 43:16.094
Why do you care?

43:18.697 --> 43:20.365
Listen, I'm sorry
I wasn't there.

43:20.398 --> 43:23.769
Yeah, well, to be honest
I didn't even notice.

43:26.805 --> 43:28.039
I got this today.

43:29.140 --> 43:31.609
Razor sent it to me
to give to you.

43:36.815 --> 43:40.786
OK. So bros over hos.
I get it.

43:40.819 --> 43:44.723
Still a pretty lame
excuse as a friend, you know?

43:44.756 --> 43:46.424
That's the thing, Emily.

43:46.457 --> 43:49.194
I don't think
I can just... [sighs]

43:49.227 --> 43:51.830
I don't think
I could just be your friend.

43:55.834 --> 43:56.935
You know?
