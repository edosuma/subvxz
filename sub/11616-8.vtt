00:00.167 --> 00:03.268
What's going on?
Possible flu outbreak.

00:03.270 --> 00:04.303
There is, currently,

00:04.305 --> 00:06.472
<i> no vaccine and it has thus far</i>

00:06.474 --> 00:08.574
<i> proven to have</i>
<i> a mortality rate of 100%.</i>

00:08.576 --> 00:10.442
Dr. Lommers just called
from Washington.

00:10.444 --> 00:12.511
<i> National Guard's on their way.</i>

00:12.513 --> 00:13.746
Captain Scott!

00:13.748 --> 00:14.780
Carnahan, right?

00:14.782 --> 00:16.515
You're walking on thin ice.

00:16.517 --> 00:18.283
You like her.

00:18.285 --> 00:19.952
JAKE:
<i> She's good, Lex.</i>

00:19.954 --> 00:21.887
<i>In the kind of way that I feel</i>
<i>like I have to do right by her.</i>

00:21.889 --> 00:23.222
I think we're being lied to.

00:23.224 --> 00:24.590
<i> I saw two bodies.</i>

00:24.592 --> 00:26.158
They were both dead
before Patient Zero.

00:26.160 --> 00:27.292
From the very beginning,

00:27.294 --> 00:28.927
you believed
that they were lying to us.

00:28.929 --> 00:30.896
What if we can prove
that you were right?

00:30.898 --> 00:32.197
We just need to get the tape

00:32.199 --> 00:34.566
<i> of the hospital security feed.</i>

00:34.568 --> 00:35.801
It's corrupted.

00:35.803 --> 00:36.902
LEX:
<i> Get it to Jana.</i>

00:36.904 --> 00:37.836
<i> She's the only person</i>

00:37.838 --> 00:39.071
<i> I can trust with this.</i>

00:39.073 --> 00:40.205
JANA:
<i> Here.</i>

00:40.207 --> 00:42.341
Recovered, decrypted...
all the footage restored.

00:42.343 --> 00:43.675
This place isn't the ivory tower

00:43.677 --> 00:44.810
<i> you think it is.</i>

00:44.812 --> 00:46.578
(grunts)
Lex, help!

00:46.580 --> 00:48.080
Please!
Jana!

00:50.418 --> 00:50.949
Freeze!

00:50.951 --> 00:52.451
Party's over.

00:52.453 --> 00:54.253
We have to find a way
out of the Cordon.

00:54.255 --> 00:55.521
The sooner, the better.

00:55.523 --> 00:56.455
Thomas, no.

00:58.959 --> 01:00.092
Don't worry.

01:00.094 --> 01:01.560
I don't get sick.

01:12.106 --> 01:15.107
CANNERTS: We are currently
47 hours post-exposure.

01:15.109 --> 01:18.243
Subject Thomas Graham continues
to show no signs of illness.

01:18.245 --> 01:21.280
I've inoculated several
cohorts of sentinel rats

01:21.282 --> 01:22.815
with the subject's serum, sputum

01:22.817 --> 01:24.883
and saliva and tested
their blood...
(squeaking)

01:24.885 --> 01:26.218
Ow! Crap!

01:26.220 --> 01:27.152
It bit me.

01:27.154 --> 01:28.387
Let me see.
Ah...

01:28.389 --> 01:31.090
Is that infected or control?

01:31.092 --> 01:33.392
Maybe it didn't

01:33.394 --> 01:34.893
go through
the gloves.
I'm infected, Doc.

01:34.895 --> 01:36.128
Larry...

01:36.130 --> 01:37.863
Larry, look at me.

01:37.865 --> 01:39.098
Now, check your gloves.

01:39.100 --> 01:42.134
(panting)

01:43.304 --> 01:44.103
Oh, no.

01:44.105 --> 01:45.871
No, no, no...
Larry...

01:45.873 --> 01:47.106
No!
Focus.

01:47.108 --> 01:48.874
The next glove.

01:48.876 --> 01:50.008
(sobs)

01:50.010 --> 01:52.277
(panting)

01:52.279 --> 01:55.013
Oh, no. Oh, no.

01:55.015 --> 01:57.249
Doc,
please help me.

01:57.251 --> 01:58.917
Got any eights?

01:58.919 --> 01:59.785
Go fish.

01:59.787 --> 02:01.186
This way, man.

02:01.188 --> 02:02.921
(people gasping, coughing)

02:02.923 --> 02:04.656
(gasping for air)

02:04.658 --> 02:06.558
Right here.

02:07.661 --> 02:09.361
Sir... right
in here.

02:15.436 --> 02:17.202
I'll check on you
in a few hours.

02:17.204 --> 02:19.037
QUENTIN:
Got any twos?

02:19.039 --> 02:21.540
Go fish!

02:21.542 --> 02:24.510
BESSER:
<i> Just couldn't toe the line,</i>

02:24.512 --> 02:25.577
could you?

02:25.579 --> 02:28.013
Did you think you'd
actually be able

02:28.015 --> 02:29.281
to breach
the Cordon?

02:29.283 --> 02:33.185
I don't even know
if she's alive.

02:34.522 --> 02:36.155
Now, you can
discipline me later,

02:36.157 --> 02:39.491
but please... help me find out.

02:39.493 --> 02:41.643
(sighs)

02:41.644 --> 02:43.794
Sorry, son,
but you don't have access.

02:43.797 --> 02:44.796
That's on you.

02:44.798 --> 02:46.098
I heard Jana screaming.

02:46.100 --> 02:47.933
Being attacked,
maybe even killed.

02:47.935 --> 02:49.468
I couldn't care less

02:49.470 --> 02:51.770
who I pissed off
trying to get to her.

02:51.772 --> 02:52.838
Well, you should.

02:52.840 --> 02:54.373
Those are the people
who could've helped you now.

02:54.375 --> 02:56.642
I don't trust
any of those people!

02:57.678 --> 02:58.744
But you?

03:00.314 --> 03:02.447
I thought at least you
would've had my back.

03:02.449 --> 03:04.349
I've had your back.

03:04.351 --> 03:07.786
I've vouched for you
from day one.

03:07.788 --> 03:10.756
I said you wouldn't be
anything like your father.

03:21.635 --> 03:23.902
You're suspended
until further notice.

03:28.509 --> 03:30.976
I'm telling you,
it's been two days

03:30.978 --> 03:32.945
and the kid's absolutely fine.

03:32.947 --> 03:34.613
You were one of
my favorite students, Victor,

03:34.615 --> 03:36.248
and you know I've always
admired your optimism...

03:36.250 --> 03:39.851
I've assayed his viral load
every six hours

03:39.853 --> 03:41.653
and... nothing.

03:41.655 --> 03:43.255
I understand
it must be difficult there

03:43.257 --> 03:44.890
and you want to believe that...

03:44.892 --> 03:46.925
If Thomas is resistant,

03:46.927 --> 03:48.994
that could be the key
to a vaccine.

03:48.996 --> 03:50.128
Even if you're able

03:50.130 --> 03:51.396
to develop a vaccine,

03:51.398 --> 03:54.132
it could take... 12, 18 months?

03:54.134 --> 03:55.400
So?

03:55.402 --> 03:57.603
That's still hope.

03:57.605 --> 04:00.038
More than we've ever had before.

04:00.040 --> 04:02.274
Does the Cordon have that long?

04:04.845 --> 04:06.678
You should call your sister
in Rockville.

04:06.680 --> 04:09.248
This line's for
official use only.

04:11.118 --> 04:12.117
She's worried about you.

04:12.119 --> 04:13.418
Well, tell her I'm fine.

04:13.420 --> 04:15.287
I'll call when
I've found a way to end this.

04:16.991 --> 04:19.625
(door opens)

04:19.627 --> 04:20.759
Hey.

04:20.761 --> 04:22.628
Hey.

04:22.630 --> 04:24.930
Well?

04:24.932 --> 04:25.998
I see you got in.

04:26.000 --> 04:27.032
Yeah.

04:27.034 --> 04:29.001
The password was "password."

04:29.003 --> 04:30.969
Nice work.

04:30.971 --> 04:33.038
Gotta hustle if I want to
make detective before you.

04:33.040 --> 04:34.039
(laughs)

04:34.041 --> 04:35.307
Better keep hustling.

04:37.478 --> 04:39.745
Think I finally found
the right footage.

04:41.315 --> 04:42.447
All right, what are we
looking at here?

04:42.449 --> 04:45.917
Okay. So here's
where it all started.

04:45.919 --> 04:47.019
Tuesday at 8:00 a.m.

04:47.021 --> 04:48.487
Here's Sanders
with Sayid.

04:48.489 --> 04:51.189
So Cannerts insists
that Sayid was Patient Zero,

04:51.191 --> 04:53.225
but we both know
Sanders died before him,

04:53.227 --> 04:54.293
so if I'm right,

04:54.295 --> 04:56.595
Sanders is infecting
Sayid here,

04:56.597 --> 04:58.063
not the other way around.

04:58.065 --> 05:00.165
We just need
to prove it.

05:00.167 --> 05:01.967
What about the boyfriend?

05:01.969 --> 05:04.770
I mean, they-they died
around the same time.

05:04.772 --> 05:06.538
I went back through
the old sign-in ledgers

05:06.540 --> 05:08.307
to see if I could
figure out who he was.

05:08.309 --> 05:10.976
A "Henry Burns" signed in
almost every day at 5:00 a.m.

05:10.978 --> 05:12.844
5:00 a.m.?

05:17.251 --> 05:18.917
Right there.
Oh.

05:18.919 --> 05:19.885
Is that him?

05:19.887 --> 05:22.020
JAKE:
There's Sanders.
That's our guy.

05:22.022 --> 05:24.089
Henry Burns.

05:26.493 --> 05:29.728
Where are you going?

05:33.067 --> 05:34.966
There's the quickie.

05:34.968 --> 05:36.635
Like clockwork.

05:36.637 --> 05:38.904
Just like
Nurse Helen said.

05:43.043 --> 05:45.077
JAKE:
5:15.

05:45.079 --> 05:46.611
That<i> was</i> a quickie.

05:49.083 --> 05:51.249
KATIE:
He stays inside until...

05:51.251 --> 05:53.285
8:16.

05:53.287 --> 05:54.519
Wait...

05:54.521 --> 05:56.788
JAKE:
Where is he going now?

06:01.895 --> 06:03.962
(sneezes)

06:06.400 --> 06:07.532
Did you see that?

06:08.736 --> 06:09.668
He knows.

06:13.874 --> 06:16.675
He knows he's sick.

06:18.278 --> 06:19.311
JAKE:
He looks panicked.

06:19.313 --> 06:21.546
KATIE:
Who is he calling?
Sanders?

06:21.548 --> 06:23.482
JAKE:
Makes sense, she's
in the building.

06:28.155 --> 06:29.955
What are you doing?

06:31.425 --> 06:32.691
That explains why
we couldn't find

06:32.693 --> 06:33.959
his personal effects, huh?

06:33.961 --> 06:36.561
Why wouldn't he want
anyone to know who he is?

06:38.132 --> 06:40.065
What are you doing?

06:45.439 --> 06:48.473
"Closed for maintenance."

06:48.475 --> 06:49.975
Burns quarantined himself.

06:53.447 --> 06:54.446
We were right.

06:54.448 --> 06:55.914
He-He's the real Patient Zero.

06:57.751 --> 07:00.752
CANNERTS:<i> I must declare</i>
<i> the virus as highly contagious</i>

07:00.754 --> 07:03.989

Oh, don't be reductive.

07:24.545 --> 07:26.111
(knocking at door)
No, David,
it really is that simple.

07:26.113 --> 07:28.480
No, it isn't, no, it...
Impeccable timing.

07:29.616 --> 07:31.082
I'm sorry,
I didn't mean to interrupt.

07:31.084 --> 07:32.083
Should I come back?

07:32.085 --> 07:34.386
No,

07:34.388 --> 07:36.755
Lex, it's fine.

07:39.326 --> 07:40.325
What do you need?

07:40.327 --> 07:41.593
Uh...

07:49.570 --> 07:52.370
I know we haven't
always seen eye-to-eye,

07:52.372 --> 07:54.272
but I'm not coming
to you as a cop.

07:54.274 --> 07:55.907
I'm coming to you as a person.

07:57.244 --> 08:00.479
You know I have
someone on the inside.

08:00.481 --> 08:02.747
I just need to know she's okay.

08:03.517 --> 08:05.684
Will you help me?

08:05.686 --> 08:07.986
I appreciate you
coming to me,

08:07.988 --> 08:10.121
Lex.

08:10.123 --> 08:12.224
And I will see about
having your sluice access

08:12.226 --> 08:15.794
temporarily reinstated so you
can get an update on Jana.

08:17.998 --> 08:19.664
Thank you.

08:19.666 --> 08:21.132
But since you're here...

08:21.134 --> 08:22.300
(clears throat)

08:22.301 --> 08:23.467
...I'd like you
to meet the Director

08:23.470 --> 08:25.237
of Infectious Diseases
at Georgetown.

08:25.239 --> 08:26.371
This is
Dr. David MacIntyre.

08:26.373 --> 08:28.039
It's good to meet you.

08:28.041 --> 08:30.542
My husband.

08:32.279 --> 08:34.546
(indistinct conversations)

08:38.185 --> 08:39.818
Two.

08:41.922 --> 08:44.289
FAITH HEALER:
<i> Should evil come upon us,</i>

08:44.291 --> 08:45.357
<i> the pestilence</i>

08:45.359 --> 08:49.160
<i> or the plague,</i>
<i>we will stand before this house</i>

08:49.162 --> 08:50.662
<i> and cry out to him.</i>

08:50.664 --> 08:53.932
<i> And he will deliver us.</i>

08:53.934 --> 08:56.968
<i> Our days on Earth</i>
<i> are like a shadow.</i>

08:56.970 --> 08:59.704
<i>But for those among the living,</i>

08:59.706 --> 09:02.073
<i> there is hope.</i>

09:02.075 --> 09:03.842
For it is written:

09:03.844 --> 09:05.944
"A prayer offered
in faith

09:05.946 --> 09:07.946
"shall save the sick.
(coughing)

09:07.948 --> 09:10.682
And the Lord will raise him up."

09:10.684 --> 09:15.053
He will sprinkle
clean water on your head.

09:15.055 --> 09:18.189
And he will cleanse you
of your impurities.

09:18.191 --> 09:19.591
Amen!
Amen.

09:19.593 --> 09:22.227
He will send
the angel of death...

09:22.229 --> 09:23.461
This place is as creepy as ever.

09:23.463 --> 09:25.897
Hmm. No, it's a little creepier.

09:25.899 --> 09:29.000
But when the destroyer
sees the mark of the faithful,

09:29.002 --> 09:31.036
he will pass
over your door...
Okay, come on.

09:31.038 --> 09:33.471
Can't believe they used
to bring us here every Sunday.

09:33.473 --> 09:35.874
Those nuns
were sadists.

09:35.876 --> 09:37.609
Are we really risking
losing our lives

09:37.611 --> 09:39.744
over this wild
goose chase?

09:39.746 --> 09:40.745
We should go back
to BitScan.

09:40.747 --> 09:41.746
Enough about
BitScan, Dennis.

09:41.748 --> 09:42.914
We're getting
out of here.

09:42.916 --> 09:44.115
SAM:
You lost the vote, man.

09:44.117 --> 09:45.750
Take it with some grace.
Come on, man.

09:45.752 --> 09:47.619
A Civil War tunnel
leading out of the city?

09:47.621 --> 09:48.987
Are you even hearing this?

09:48.989 --> 09:52.324
FAITH HEALER:
And it will move.

09:52.326 --> 09:55.226
If you have faith,

09:55.228 --> 09:56.494
nothing is impossible.

09:56.496 --> 09:58.163
Let those without fear

09:58.165 --> 10:01.967
or doubt come forward
and be healed.

10:01.969 --> 10:03.034
(coughing)

10:03.036 --> 10:06.771
As you have
believed,

10:06.773 --> 10:09.007
so it will be done.

10:09.009 --> 10:10.709
LEX:
<i> What happened?</i>

10:10.711 --> 10:12.410
JAKE:
<i> She's fine, I promise.</i>

10:12.412 --> 10:13.411
What happened?

10:13.413 --> 10:14.512
BitScan got
overrun

10:14.514 --> 10:15.914
by tweakers.

10:15.916 --> 10:17.182
Little hairy for a minute,

10:17.184 --> 10:19.384
but we...
we pulled through all right.

10:19.386 --> 10:20.819
It actually was...

10:20.821 --> 10:23.021
it was her plan
that saved all of us.

10:23.023 --> 10:24.856
You'd be proud.

10:27.694 --> 10:29.527
That's good.

10:29.529 --> 10:31.630
I mean, she's smart, right?

10:31.632 --> 10:34.666
(laughs):
Smart. She's a genius.

10:35.602 --> 10:37.802
Hey, that reminds me.

10:37.804 --> 10:40.338
Our elusive
hospital surveillance.

10:42.209 --> 10:44.809
She fixed it?
Yeah, like
a charm.

10:44.811 --> 10:46.945
Hey, by the way,
don't ever piss her off.

10:46.947 --> 10:50.148
Your woman is lethal
with a blowtorch.

10:50.150 --> 10:52.283
(laughs)

10:53.053 --> 10:55.286
Hey, what's with the civvies?

10:55.288 --> 10:56.855
Chief suspended me.

10:56.857 --> 10:59.524
You're the best cop he's got.
Being a good cop

10:59.526 --> 11:01.926
and being
on Besser's good side...

11:01.928 --> 11:04.663
they seem to be
two different ideas these days.

11:04.665 --> 11:05.697
(sighs)

11:05.699 --> 11:07.499
What'd you find?

11:07.501 --> 11:10.602
You take a look at
time code 8:16, the day
before the Cordon went up.

11:10.604 --> 11:12.470
That's our real
Patient Zero.

11:12.472 --> 11:13.872
Name of Henry Burns.

11:13.874 --> 11:15.974
He made some mystery call
and then ditched his I.D.

11:15.976 --> 11:17.275
after he realized he was sick.

11:17.277 --> 11:19.477
He went to an awful lot
of trouble to hide his identity.

11:19.479 --> 11:22.781
You think you can find out
who this guy is?
I'm sure I can.

11:24.084 --> 11:26.685
Listen, this was
a one-time deal.

11:26.687 --> 11:29.087
Since I got suspended...

11:29.089 --> 11:31.056
I won't have access
to the sluice.

11:31.058 --> 11:33.591
I don't know when
we'll see each other again.

11:33.593 --> 11:35.260
Maybe not until
this is over.

11:35.262 --> 11:39.064
Just do what you got to do to
blow this whole thing wide open.

11:39.066 --> 11:41.232
Will do.

11:41.234 --> 11:43.168
Got any queens?

11:44.004 --> 11:45.603
Hi, Nurse Helen.
Hi, Katie.

11:45.605 --> 11:47.605
Come on, Quentin,
time for lunch.

11:47.607 --> 11:49.074
I can't just
leave Thomas.

11:49.076 --> 11:52.977
He'll still be here
when you get back.
CANNERTS: Actually, he won't.

11:55.882 --> 11:57.082
What's happening?

11:57.084 --> 11:58.049
Sit tight.

11:58.051 --> 11:59.417
I'm gonna keep you
in isolation

11:59.419 --> 12:01.720
for the standard 48 hours
just as a precaution.

12:01.722 --> 12:03.922
But don't worry...

12:03.924 --> 12:06.558
the rat that bit you was
inoculated with Thomas' blood.

12:06.560 --> 12:10.061
And since Thomas can't get sick,
the rat can't be sick, either.

12:10.063 --> 12:12.030
KATIE:
How is that possible?
We know Thomas

12:12.032 --> 12:14.766
was exposed over and over again.
At first

12:14.768 --> 12:16.101
I thought Thomas
didn't get infected

12:16.103 --> 12:18.636
because he was resistant
to the virus,

12:18.638 --> 12:20.338
which would help us
make a vaccine.

12:20.340 --> 12:23.007
But now I know
we can do

12:23.009 --> 12:24.542
better than that.

12:24.544 --> 12:27.746
I've just discovered that Thomas
has viral-specific antibodies,

12:27.748 --> 12:29.814
which means he<i> did</i> get infected.

12:29.816 --> 12:32.417
But everyone
who gets the virus dies.

12:32.419 --> 12:35.320
CANNERTS: Not Thomas.
His body defeated the virus,

12:35.322 --> 12:38.757
and that will help us
defeat it.

12:38.759 --> 12:40.291
Do you know
what that means?

12:40.293 --> 12:42.327
(Thomas laughs)
It means Thomas' cells

12:42.329 --> 12:45.130
contain the blueprint
for a cure.

12:55.075 --> 12:58.009
¶ ¶
(indistinct chatter)

13:05.118 --> 13:06.484
SUZY:
I'm telling you, it's real.

13:06.486 --> 13:08.953
The Confederates used it
during Sherman's siege.

13:08.955 --> 13:10.221
Tell him, Jana.

13:10.223 --> 13:12.123
It's real.
We've seen it.

13:14.294 --> 13:16.728
Half those people look sick.
FAITH HEALER:
Whoever has faith

13:16.730 --> 13:18.129
has hope.
I don't know.

13:18.131 --> 13:19.964
I don't get why
you didn't tell us

13:19.966 --> 13:22.400
about this tunnel
days ago.
Drop it, Dennis.

13:22.402 --> 13:24.335
(faith healer continues
indistinctly)

13:24.337 --> 13:27.038
It's because you didn't think
Suzy could make it out

13:27.040 --> 13:28.306
with her claustrophobia.

13:28.308 --> 13:30.008
Uh, I can make it.

13:30.010 --> 13:31.776
I made it before.

13:31.778 --> 13:33.878
That Sunday when we tried
to run away after Bible study,

13:33.880 --> 13:35.513
we almost made it.

13:35.515 --> 13:36.848
Right, Jana?

13:36.850 --> 13:38.650
You're right, Sooz.

13:38.652 --> 13:40.118
You'll be fine.

13:40.120 --> 13:42.487
(indistinct chatter)

13:45.425 --> 13:47.492
SAM: What really happened
in that tunnel?

13:48.695 --> 13:50.261
(sighs)

13:50.263 --> 13:52.831
She had a meltdown
20 yards in.

13:52.833 --> 13:56.201
She wouldn't go further,
and I couldn't get
her to go back out.

13:56.203 --> 13:58.436
We were stuck there for hours.
That's how I figured out

13:58.438 --> 14:00.205
she was claustrophobic.
FAITH HEALER:
Believe...

14:00.207 --> 14:02.440
and be healed.
WOMAN: Amen!

14:02.442 --> 14:04.943
Driven and tossed
by the wind...

14:04.945 --> 14:06.578
WOMAN:
Yeah, let him speak!

14:06.580 --> 14:08.346
(shuddering)
Believe...

14:08.348 --> 14:10.148
and be healed!

14:11.651 --> 14:13.585
Don't be afraid!
WOMAN: Amen!

14:14.788 --> 14:17.021
Let's get out of here.
Where's this tunnel?

14:17.023 --> 14:19.624
FAITH HEALER:
If you believe, you will see...

14:19.626 --> 14:20.959
Behind that door

14:20.961 --> 14:22.327
is a brick wall.

14:22.329 --> 14:23.528
Behind that is

14:23.530 --> 14:25.964
our way out.

14:25.966 --> 14:28.132
How do we get through?

14:29.636 --> 14:32.537
We wait.

14:32.539 --> 14:35.273
MAN: Preach, preach!
FAITH HEALER: Believe!

14:36.343 --> 14:39.944
I know you've not been
cleaning the place.

14:39.946 --> 14:40.845
Oh. Thank you.

14:40.847 --> 14:42.247
What'd you find?

14:42.249 --> 14:44.215
Checked out that Burns guy.
Get this.

14:44.217 --> 14:46.918
Got his PhD in
microbiology.
Suspicious.

14:46.920 --> 14:48.920
Did his postdoc
in emerging infectious diseases

14:48.922 --> 14:51.723
at Emory from 2009 to 2013.

14:51.725 --> 14:53.057
And then what?

14:53.059 --> 14:54.359
And then nothing.

14:54.361 --> 14:57.428
No employment, no presence
of any kind on the Internet.

14:57.430 --> 14:58.730
So what, he's a spy?

14:58.732 --> 15:02.100
See, that's the thing-- spies
always have convincing covers.

15:02.102 --> 15:04.102
You know what
that tells me?
He's been working

15:04.104 --> 15:05.803
off the books.
Exactly.

15:05.805 --> 15:07.071
I'm gonna get
my hacker friend on this.

15:07.073 --> 15:09.674
Burns' girlfriend was
a doctor at the hospital--
I'll see if my friend

15:09.676 --> 15:11.042
can track him
through her e-mail.

15:11.044 --> 15:12.610
And what about Burns'
phone records?

15:12.612 --> 15:14.512
Who'd he call<i> from </i>
the hospital?

15:14.514 --> 15:17.615
I'd check the records
myself, but, uh...

15:18.718 --> 15:21.886
I might have a way
to get those, too.

15:21.888 --> 15:23.554
(beeping)

15:28.561 --> 15:30.128
I'm being summoned.

15:30.130 --> 15:31.596
I thought you were suspended.

15:31.598 --> 15:32.997
Yeah, me, too.

15:32.999 --> 15:35.433
(beeping)

15:35.435 --> 15:36.634
Yeah?

15:36.636 --> 15:38.036
(opens door)

15:38.038 --> 15:40.505
CANNERTS:
<i> ELISA plate reader,</i>
<i> PCR thermocyclers,</i>

15:40.507 --> 15:42.540
cell culture incubator.
All right.

15:42.542 --> 15:44.776
Tell Lommers we need
more firepower.

15:44.778 --> 15:46.377
Right.
As soon as
we figure out

15:46.379 --> 15:49.981
how Thomas defeated the virus,
we can develop a treatment.

15:49.983 --> 15:53.851
(sighs)
And then this cordon comes down.

15:53.853 --> 15:55.486
Dr. Cannerts.

15:55.488 --> 15:58.089
I can't believe this
could all be over soon.

15:58.091 --> 16:02.293
I know. This feels like
it could actually happen.

16:02.295 --> 16:04.262
Hey, you know,
for someone who's just heard

16:04.264 --> 16:06.164
they might not be
spending life in prison,

16:06.166 --> 16:08.199
you don't seem
that excited.

16:08.201 --> 16:10.568
Yeah, well, the real
world's no picnic.

16:11.871 --> 16:13.271
Oh, God.
(laughs)

16:13.273 --> 16:16.374
(laughing):
That sounded terrible!

16:16.376 --> 16:17.141
No.

16:17.143 --> 16:19.077
Of course I'm excited.

16:19.079 --> 16:21.946
I'm just nervous, I guess.

16:21.948 --> 16:23.614
Afraid to get my hopes up.

16:23.616 --> 16:24.749
Yeah.

16:24.751 --> 16:27.385
What about you?
No, I'm not afraid
to get my hopes up.

16:27.387 --> 16:28.386
(laughs)

16:28.388 --> 16:30.488
Definitely gonna take
a sick day

16:30.490 --> 16:32.156
or... or five.

16:32.158 --> 16:35.026
You know,
hit some ball games,

16:35.028 --> 16:36.227
grab some beers.

16:36.229 --> 16:38.296
(takes deep breath)

16:38.298 --> 16:40.498
Just be nice to not have
any responsibilities

16:40.500 --> 16:42.166
for a while, you know?

16:43.503 --> 16:46.170
Yeah. Sounds nice.

16:46.172 --> 16:48.706
(woman speaking indistinctly
over P.A.)

17:02.655 --> 17:04.522
What is this,
a bribe?

17:04.524 --> 17:07.592
It's an olive branch.
I need you in uniform for this.

17:07.594 --> 17:10.061
There's a child
under Cannerts' care

17:10.063 --> 17:13.364
who represents a chance
for a cure.

17:14.667 --> 17:15.800
Hope.

17:15.802 --> 17:18.636
What do you want me to do?

17:18.638 --> 17:22.607
I need you to help me
sneak him out of the Cordon.

17:22.609 --> 17:24.275
¶ ¶

17:31.284 --> 17:33.618
LOMMERS: Thanks to Dr. Cannerts'
extraordinary efforts,

17:33.620 --> 17:34.886
we now have
an unusual opportunity

17:34.888 --> 17:37.388
that may allow us to bring
a swift end to this cordon.

17:37.390 --> 17:40.658
Although Dr. Cannerts has
been working around the clock,

17:40.660 --> 17:42.827
there's only so much
one man can do.

17:42.829 --> 17:44.095
It's imperative we get Thomas

17:44.097 --> 17:46.364
to the CDC for further study.

17:46.366 --> 17:49.700
Dr. Lommers, I must disagree
with this course of action.

17:49.702 --> 17:52.103
You will field-test
any promising drugs,

17:52.105 --> 17:54.372
but the actual research
will be done here.

17:54.374 --> 17:56.240
If Thomas is
coming out of the Cordon,

17:56.242 --> 17:57.909
I should come with him.
Dr. Cannerts,

17:57.911 --> 17:58.976
you know that's not possible.

17:58.978 --> 18:01.045
Thomas is the only one
who's immune to the virus.

18:01.047 --> 18:02.313
But I'm the only one
who understands

18:02.315 --> 18:03.514
how this virus works.

18:03.516 --> 18:05.183
If I could...
I'm aware that you've been

18:05.185 --> 18:06.551
in communication with my husband
regarding Thomas.

18:06.553 --> 18:09.153
If it makes you feel better,
I can have David take point

18:09.155 --> 18:10.555
on the research.

18:10.557 --> 18:11.522
Now,

18:11.524 --> 18:13.124
secrecy will
be critical

18:13.126 --> 18:14.525
for a successful
extraction.

18:14.527 --> 18:16.427
If anyone realizes we're
letting Thomas out,

18:16.429 --> 18:17.528
there could be chaos.

18:17.530 --> 18:19.630
No one will see the hope
for a cure,

18:19.632 --> 18:21.999
just the fact that someone
got out that wasn't them.

18:22.001 --> 18:23.134
I've asked
Major Carnahan

18:23.136 --> 18:26.003
to spearhead
this operation. Lex?

18:26.005 --> 18:28.473
Wait. You're putting
the guy who tried

18:28.475 --> 18:30.541
to break into
the Cordon in charge?

18:30.543 --> 18:32.376
As Major Carnahan
was instrumental

18:32.378 --> 18:35.179
in the construction
and protection of the Cordon,

18:35.181 --> 18:38.282
no one is better suited
to break someone out.

18:38.284 --> 18:42.153
He did almost make it past you,
after all.

18:43.623 --> 18:45.490
Too many eyes
on the primary sluice.

18:45.492 --> 18:48.159
I've determined that
the best course of action

18:48.161 --> 18:50.928
is to create a makeshift sluice
in an area

18:50.930 --> 18:52.597
with sufficient ground cover

18:52.599 --> 18:54.899
to obscure direct
sight lines.

18:54.901 --> 18:56.601
Workmen will
cut holes here

18:56.603 --> 18:59.604
and here, creating
two new reinforced doors,

18:59.606 --> 19:01.839
making a new sluice
to the Cordon.

19:01.841 --> 19:04.308
SCOTT:
A new door is a
new vulnerability.

19:04.310 --> 19:07.345
I'll need my men
stationed above.

19:07.347 --> 19:09.580
Armed guards will
be visible on top.

19:09.582 --> 19:12.583
They will draw eyes exactly
where we don't want them--

19:12.585 --> 19:14.252
on that door.
Maybe you just

19:14.254 --> 19:15.520
don't want my eyes on you.

19:15.522 --> 19:17.054
LOMMERS:
Gentlemen, give it a rest.

19:17.056 --> 19:18.723
You can whip out
the rulers later.

19:18.725 --> 19:20.758
Captain Scott will be
in charge of security,

19:20.760 --> 19:24.362
but Major Carnahan
will have final word
on logistics.

19:24.364 --> 19:26.330
What he says goes.

19:26.332 --> 19:28.099
And, Dr. Cannerts,
you will have that child

19:28.101 --> 19:30.067
to the wall
at 7:00 a.m. tomorrow.

19:30.069 --> 19:31.702
Are we all clear?

19:34.340 --> 19:36.741
LOMMERS:
Then this is it.

19:38.077 --> 19:39.911
The beginning of the end.

19:39.913 --> 19:42.280
JAKE:<i> It's the most exposed part</i>
<i> of our route.</i>

19:42.282 --> 19:44.282
We need to be at the
extraction point at 7:00 a.m.

19:44.284 --> 19:47.752
And once we've delivered
Thomas, we can head back
to the hospital.

19:48.721 --> 19:50.821
And after that?

19:50.823 --> 19:52.890
(chuckles)

19:53.993 --> 19:55.726
After that, um...

19:57.864 --> 19:59.363
...then eventually life...

19:59.365 --> 20:01.499
life goes back to normal.

20:02.235 --> 20:05.203
(sighs):
Jake...

20:06.372 --> 20:09.440
After this is all over...

20:09.442 --> 20:12.009
if we don't end up
seeing each other much,

20:12.011 --> 20:13.544
if...

20:13.546 --> 20:16.314
this is just a moment in time...

20:16.316 --> 20:19.984
I just want you to know
I'm still glad I met you.

20:21.721 --> 20:25.256
Why wouldn't...
why wouldn't we...

20:25.258 --> 20:27.058
Don't you want

20:27.060 --> 20:29.126
to see each other?

20:29.128 --> 20:31.829
(sighs):
It's just...

20:31.831 --> 20:35.533
Back in the real world,
I am going back to debt...

20:38.371 --> 20:40.871
...and custody battles...

20:40.873 --> 20:42.907
and...

20:42.909 --> 20:44.442
keeping my chemistry
in line,

20:44.444 --> 20:46.611
and God knows what
else. (laughs)

20:48.681 --> 20:51.449
You shouldn't have to deal
with the responsibilities

20:51.451 --> 20:53.084
in my crazy life.

20:53.086 --> 20:54.318
Yeah, okay,

20:54.320 --> 20:56.787
what if I want to?
You won't.

20:56.789 --> 20:58.990
And that's okay.

21:18.478 --> 21:19.710
...this get you down.

21:19.712 --> 21:21.078
Why, you're
Donald Lockwood, aren't you?

21:21.080 --> 21:22.446
(door opens)

21:22.448 --> 21:24.782
WOMAN: This is a Cordon
emergency broadcast channel.

21:24.784 --> 21:25.650
(door closes)

21:25.652 --> 21:27.752
You'll never guess the news
from the hospital.

21:27.754 --> 21:31.022
Dr. Cannerts,
he had a breakthrough.

21:31.024 --> 21:33.224
Maybe even the key
to a cure.

21:33.226 --> 21:35.359
Ah, I bet your rats helped.

21:35.361 --> 21:36.827
Well, I don't know.

21:36.829 --> 21:38.195
Let's celebrate.

21:38.197 --> 21:39.830
Take me dancing.

21:39.832 --> 21:40.931
(both chuckle)

21:40.933 --> 21:43.934
I'll put on
our song.

21:43.936 --> 21:45.469
All right.

21:45.471 --> 21:47.738
(Leonard Cohen's "Anthem" plays)

21:47.740 --> 21:51.042
I'll just go find
a pretty dress.

21:51.044 --> 21:52.209
You look perfect just like that.

21:52.211 --> 21:53.477
Prettier than
the day I met you.

21:53.479 --> 21:55.212
And you're a better
liar than you were

21:55.214 --> 21:56.647
the first time I met you.

21:56.649 --> 22:00.651
Well, just let me
go get my pearls on.

22:00.653 --> 22:02.386
A girl can't dance
without pearls.

22:02.388 --> 22:04.588
(both chuckle)

22:04.590 --> 22:06.590
BERT: It's still
the best day of my life,

22:06.592 --> 22:09.327
day I first met you.

22:09.329 --> 22:12.063
I wanted to dance with you then,

22:12.065 --> 22:14.999
and I wanted to dance
with you every day

22:15.001 --> 22:17.034
for the rest of my life.

22:18.404 --> 22:21.405

22:32.051 --> 22:35.786
It's all right, Bertie,
I'm-I'm all right.

<i> I'll be there in five minutes.</i>

22:43.696 --> 22:46.697
Nobody touches those containers
until I get there.

22:55.141 --> 22:56.407
Your phone does work.

22:56.409 --> 22:58.409
Leo, I'm on the move, all right?

22:58.411 --> 23:00.411
I will come by
your place tomorrow.

23:00.413 --> 23:02.279
I have a gift.

23:02.281 --> 23:03.547
From my hacker friend.

23:03.549 --> 23:08.285
A biohazard package was
delivered to Burns from the CDC

23:08.287 --> 23:10.020
two days before the outbreak.

23:10.022 --> 23:12.656
From the CDC?
Yes.

23:12.658 --> 23:14.425
You actually think
they sent Burns the virus?

23:14.427 --> 23:15.426
Of course I do.

23:15.428 --> 23:16.560
And we are gonna nail them, man.

23:16.562 --> 23:17.962
But we got to have more proof.

23:17.964 --> 23:19.697
The delivery notice doesn't say
what was inside the package,

23:19.699 --> 23:21.966
but the CDC should have
a copy of it.

23:21.968 --> 23:23.367
So can we use
your access to prove

23:23.369 --> 23:25.302
that's where
the virus came from?
Yes, yes, we can.

23:25.304 --> 23:27.405
Just not right now, Leo.

23:27.407 --> 23:28.539
Priorities, man.

23:28.541 --> 23:29.807
You said you wanted the truth.

23:29.809 --> 23:31.675
This is what it means
to dig for it.
I do want the truth.

23:31.677 --> 23:33.411
But I want to end this cordon,

23:33.413 --> 23:35.946
and... that has priority.

23:38.351 --> 23:39.884
What does Lommers
got you doing now?

23:39.886 --> 23:42.153
I can't tell you.
LEO: Ah...

23:42.155 --> 23:43.687
So we're hot on the trail

23:43.689 --> 23:46.056
of the people who put
Jana in this prison,

23:46.058 --> 23:47.158
and you want to bail

23:47.160 --> 23:49.093
because you're right back
in the pocket of its warden.

23:49.095 --> 23:50.628
Leo. Leo, you have to trust me.

23:50.630 --> 23:52.363
LEO: Trust you!
I will get to this,

23:52.365 --> 23:53.798
just not right now.

23:53.800 --> 23:55.866
Trust you?

23:57.570 --> 23:59.837
You mean like the way
you're trusting me right now?

23:59.839 --> 24:02.106
By telling me
what Lommers is up to?

24:05.511 --> 24:07.778
Yeah, that's what I thought.

24:09.982 --> 24:12.049
Well...

24:13.786 --> 24:16.053
Congrats on getting
your badge back, Major.

24:29.235 --> 24:31.602
(grunting)

24:34.540 --> 24:36.640
(indistinct chatter)

24:36.642 --> 24:39.243
You mind if I take a turn?

24:39.245 --> 24:40.778
Knock yourself out.

24:43.015 --> 24:44.248
Hey!
JANA: Hey!

24:44.250 --> 24:45.683
Watch it, Dennis.

24:45.685 --> 24:47.685
Let him get
out of the way first.

24:47.687 --> 24:49.119
Uh, yeah, I'm sorry.

24:49.121 --> 24:50.154
You good?

24:50.156 --> 24:52.089
Yeah, I'm good.

24:54.160 --> 24:55.259
(chiseling)

24:55.261 --> 24:57.528
And let me guess.

24:57.530 --> 24:58.929
Dennis suddenly remembered

24:58.931 --> 25:01.866
he's got a wife
on the outside?

25:04.637 --> 25:07.438
Hey, where's your birth mom now?

25:07.440 --> 25:10.674
I don't want to play that
stupid game right now, Jana.

25:10.676 --> 25:12.943
(chiseling continues)

25:16.482 --> 25:18.916
(cell phone rings)

25:18.918 --> 25:20.451
Major Carnahan.

25:20.453 --> 25:22.253
Thought you were busy
being a minion.

25:22.255 --> 25:25.256
Yeah, so I found a record
of that shipment at the CDC.

25:25.258 --> 25:26.857
Yeah? What happened
to your other priorities?

25:26.859 --> 25:29.126
I said I'd get to it,
and I got to it.

25:29.128 --> 25:31.428
Did you confirm
it was the virus?

25:31.430 --> 25:32.596
No, it didn't say.

25:32.598 --> 25:33.597
But guess who paid for it.

25:33.599 --> 25:35.866
A Dr. Victor Cannerts.

25:35.868 --> 25:38.702
The Cordon's chief scientist
sent hazardous material

25:38.704 --> 25:40.170
to Patient Zero?

25:40.172 --> 25:41.972
Oh, man, that is good.

25:41.974 --> 25:43.974
You really know the way
to a journalist's heart.

25:43.976 --> 25:46.443
Yeah, well, I poked around
Cannerts' office

25:46.445 --> 25:48.579
while at the CDC, and nothing.

25:48.581 --> 25:49.713
You think you can
check his place?

25:49.715 --> 25:51.115
Yeah, I'll see what I can find.

25:51.117 --> 25:53.484
May need to dust off
my B and E skills for it.

25:53.486 --> 25:54.718
I didn't hear that.

25:54.720 --> 25:55.853
Hey, now that you're
back on the force,

25:55.855 --> 25:57.321
you think you can get
those phone records?

25:57.323 --> 25:58.589
One thing at a time, Leo.

25:58.591 --> 25:59.990
Hey, look, I'm getting
close to the Cordon,

25:59.992 --> 26:02.259
(connection breaking):
so I might lose recep...

26:03.462 --> 26:05.262
Hello.

26:10.202 --> 26:12.002
Come on! You got to be kidding!

26:21.347 --> 26:22.479
What the hell is this?!

26:22.481 --> 26:25.082
I said no armed guards
on the wall!

26:25.084 --> 26:26.617
You're logistics.

26:26.619 --> 26:27.885
I'm security.

26:27.887 --> 26:30.387
Came down here
and found it unsecured.

26:30.389 --> 26:31.789
They will draw attention!

26:31.791 --> 26:33.357
You let me worry about that.

26:33.359 --> 26:34.358
Stop! Stop!

26:34.360 --> 26:36.493
(saw whirring)

26:36.495 --> 26:37.494
What is he doing?

26:37.496 --> 26:39.396
Your guy wasn't making progress.

26:39.398 --> 26:42.600
All right, if we can hear it,
they can hear it.

26:42.602 --> 26:43.867
What you think they'd do
if they knew

26:43.869 --> 26:46.036
we were letting
just one person out?

26:48.507 --> 26:50.774
Let's go.

26:50.776 --> 26:52.242
(saw resumes whirring)

27:05.358 --> 27:07.358
Big day
tomorrow.

27:07.360 --> 27:08.659
Can't sleep?

27:08.661 --> 27:11.428
Do I have to go?

27:11.430 --> 27:13.530
Who's your favorite superhero?

27:13.532 --> 27:14.999
Superman.

27:15.001 --> 27:15.933
Me, too.

27:15.935 --> 27:18.268
You know how
he has superpowers?

27:18.270 --> 27:20.270
He's from Krypton.

27:20.272 --> 27:21.271
He can fly.

27:21.273 --> 27:23.974
And he has X-ray vision.

27:23.976 --> 27:24.942
Exactly.

27:24.944 --> 27:28.545
Did you know that you have
a superpower, too?

27:28.547 --> 27:30.247
What?

27:30.249 --> 27:34.718
Your power is that you
give people hope.

27:34.720 --> 27:37.521
I know it's scary
to leave Quentin

27:37.523 --> 27:41.692
and-and Mary and Britney,
but you are helping all of us.

27:41.694 --> 27:43.927
And we really appreciate it.

27:46.699 --> 27:49.366
Thanks, Miss Katie.

27:50.569 --> 27:51.835
Good night.

27:51.837 --> 27:55.105
(chuckles)
Night, Superman.

28:11.190 --> 28:13.257
(sighs)

28:14.927 --> 28:17.494
You...

28:17.496 --> 28:20.064
You think I'll run.

28:21.567 --> 28:25.569
And maybe I would
have once, okay?

28:25.571 --> 28:27.137
But I'm not that guy anymore.

28:27.139 --> 28:31.341
If you think that your crazy
life is gonna scare me off,

28:31.343 --> 28:34.611
you are so wrong, okay?

28:34.613 --> 28:36.680
There's nothing
out there or in here

28:36.682 --> 28:41.018
that scares me as much
as the thought of losing you.

28:44.757 --> 28:48.492
There's no version of my life...

28:48.494 --> 28:50.761
that doesn't have you in it.

28:54.200 --> 28:57.267
You can't promise that.

29:02.775 --> 29:06.043

33:01.780 --> 33:04.147
Okay, it's time to go.

33:04.149 --> 33:05.482
MARY:
Thanks for saving me,

33:05.484 --> 33:06.450
Thomas.

33:06.452 --> 33:07.184
(kisses)

33:07.186 --> 33:09.553
KATIE:
Okay, let's go.

33:10.723 --> 33:12.656
You be good.

33:19.665 --> 33:21.164
Sooz.

33:21.166 --> 33:22.566
I was wrong.

33:23.736 --> 33:24.768
I can't do it.

33:24.770 --> 33:25.769
You can.

33:25.771 --> 33:27.037
Come on.

33:27.039 --> 33:28.071
You almost made it before.

33:28.073 --> 33:29.773
Remember?

33:29.775 --> 33:32.175
We both know I won't make it.

33:33.812 --> 33:35.312
Just go without me.

33:35.314 --> 33:36.646
I'm not leaving you here.

33:36.648 --> 33:37.447
I'll hole up here.

33:37.449 --> 33:38.648
Wait till this is all over.

33:38.650 --> 33:39.783
Then I'll find you.

33:39.785 --> 33:42.285
You have a life waiting for you.

33:42.287 --> 33:43.420
Go.

33:43.422 --> 33:44.521
Be with Lex!

33:44.523 --> 33:45.522
Suzy.

33:45.524 --> 33:47.424
It's okay, Jana.

33:47.426 --> 33:49.760
I'll be okay without you.

33:49.762 --> 33:51.328
(sighs)

33:53.599 --> 33:55.332
Yeah, but I'm not gonna
be okay without you,

33:55.334 --> 33:56.800
so let's just go back.

33:56.802 --> 33:57.985
No!

33:57.986 --> 33:59.169
I won't let you
give up everything

33:59.171 --> 34:00.103
because of me.

34:00.105 --> 34:01.772
(panting)

34:05.544 --> 34:06.676
(sighs)

34:06.678 --> 34:07.677
(sighs)

34:07.679 --> 34:09.312
Okay, let's go.

34:09.314 --> 34:10.113
(sighs)

34:10.115 --> 34:11.114
Faster is better.

34:11.116 --> 34:13.650
(chuckles) Sooz.

34:13.652 --> 34:15.685
(panting)

34:15.687 --> 34:17.354
Come on.

34:18.824 --> 34:19.956
Careful.

34:19.958 --> 34:21.158
Okay.

34:21.160 --> 34:23.727
(panting)

34:24.830 --> 34:25.829
BERT:
Ooh.

34:25.831 --> 34:27.197
That doesn't look good.

34:27.199 --> 34:28.698
I'm not sure that's gonna
heal on its own.

34:28.700 --> 34:29.733
I'm fine, mother hen.

34:29.735 --> 34:31.401
Stop clucking.

34:31.403 --> 34:33.537
I'd say we should go
to the hospital, but...

34:33.539 --> 34:35.472
I'll go ask Dr. Cannerts
what we should do.

34:35.474 --> 34:37.207
No, do not bother that poor man

34:37.209 --> 34:39.843
about a nothing paper cut
like this.

34:39.845 --> 34:40.677
I'm going.

34:40.679 --> 34:42.245
We'll have our dance

34:42.247 --> 34:43.580
when I get back home.

34:43.582 --> 34:45.315
All right?

34:48.954 --> 34:51.221
(panting)

34:53.692 --> 34:54.991
Where are we?

34:54.993 --> 34:56.259
I don't know.

34:56.261 --> 34:57.661
Where are the guys?

35:03.268 --> 35:04.734
(groans)
This place is a graveyard.

35:11.143 --> 35:13.176
Oh, my God.

35:13.178 --> 35:15.479
There must be some sort
of gas in here. Help me!

35:15.481 --> 35:16.480
Hurry.

35:16.482 --> 35:18.482
(groaning)

35:18.484 --> 35:19.449
Stand by!

35:19.451 --> 35:21.017
As soon as Thomas comes out,

35:21.019 --> 35:22.886
I want him on his way to the CDC

35:22.888 --> 35:24.287
before the morning rush hour.

35:24.289 --> 35:26.423
That's T-minus 15.

35:26.425 --> 35:28.291
Assume your positions.

35:28.293 --> 35:29.392
OFFICER:
Yes, sir.

35:29.394 --> 35:32.295
Everything on schedule, then?

35:32.297 --> 35:34.364
I didn't think you were planning
on coming down here.

35:34.366 --> 35:36.800
You never have before.

35:36.802 --> 35:38.735
This is a big day.

35:43.442 --> 35:45.709
(indistinct conversations)

35:51.850 --> 35:53.316
We're good.
Close it.

35:55.053 --> 35:56.453
Change the dressing once a day

35:56.455 --> 35:58.355
using antiseptic
and a new gauze.

35:58.357 --> 36:00.323
There are antibiotics
in there.

36:00.325 --> 36:02.392
Start them now so the wound
doesn't get infected.

36:02.394 --> 36:04.728
Oh, thank you, Doctor.

36:04.730 --> 36:06.263
HELEN: That is quite
the war room, Larry.

36:06.265 --> 36:07.364
LARRY: And warm champagne

36:07.366 --> 36:09.065
never tasted so good.

36:09.067 --> 36:10.433
Sure you won't stay?

36:10.435 --> 36:12.602
We found some champagne in one
of the surgeon's lockers.

36:12.604 --> 36:14.604
This is your accomplishment,
too, after all.

36:14.606 --> 36:16.806
Thanks, but, uh,
my Micheline is waiting.

36:16.808 --> 36:18.141
Give her my best.

36:18.143 --> 36:19.809
Stop by the cafeteria
on your way out.

36:19.811 --> 36:21.611
Take a few more MREs home.

36:24.816 --> 36:26.416
LARRY:
To Thomas.

36:26.418 --> 36:28.318
Hey, Dr. Cannerts,

36:28.320 --> 36:29.920
you want a glass of bubbly?

36:32.157 --> 36:34.191
(sneezes)

36:35.460 --> 36:37.394
(groans)

36:39.998 --> 36:41.598
(retching)

36:42.367 --> 36:43.934
(Helen screaming)

36:54.279 --> 36:56.112
Go to my office, call Lommers,

36:56.114 --> 36:57.414
tell her to abort the transfer.

36:57.416 --> 36:59.316
Thomas is
an asymptomatic carrier.

36:59.318 --> 37:01.484
He can still infect people
even if he seems fine.

37:01.486 --> 37:04.254
If Thomas leaves the Cordon,
the virus leaves with him.

37:18.570 --> 37:20.937
No one wants to say it, but...

37:20.939 --> 37:23.773
We have to go back to BitScan.

37:25.010 --> 37:26.710
It's familiar.

37:26.712 --> 37:28.778
We can refortify.

37:31.650 --> 37:33.250
Dennis?

37:35.153 --> 37:37.420
I'm not coming.

37:37.422 --> 37:38.421
No, Dennis.

37:38.423 --> 37:40.290
There must be
another way out.

37:40.292 --> 37:43.059
Look, I just...

37:43.061 --> 37:45.328
I can't go back to square one.

37:47.699 --> 37:48.999
I can't

37:49.001 --> 37:51.334
do any of this.

37:52.204 --> 37:54.471
I need to get back to my family.

37:58.644 --> 38:00.410
Come back!

38:03.048 --> 38:04.681
Don't leave me.

38:04.683 --> 38:06.283
(door opens)

38:06.285 --> 38:08.184
Let him go.

38:08.186 --> 38:09.319
(door closes)

38:09.321 --> 38:10.754
(sobbing)

38:12.991 --> 38:15.325
How about bowling?

38:16.995 --> 38:18.094
Yeah, sweaty shoes.

38:18.096 --> 38:19.429
(laughs)
Not romantic.

38:21.500 --> 38:22.465
You okay in there?

38:22.467 --> 38:23.566
Are we there yet?

38:23.568 --> 38:25.068
A bit more, kiddo.
Lie still and quiet.

38:25.070 --> 38:26.069
Just like we practiced.

38:26.071 --> 38:28.138
Okay?

38:28.140 --> 38:29.773
There it is.

38:34.212 --> 38:36.513
Hey, put your mask up.

38:36.515 --> 38:38.381
Let's hurry, get this done.

38:56.401 --> 38:57.967
JAKE:
Get him out.

38:57.969 --> 38:59.769
Come on.

38:59.771 --> 39:01.004
Jump out.

39:03.875 --> 39:06.009
Hey.

39:06.011 --> 39:07.777
Remember your superpower, okay?

39:18.724 --> 39:20.790
Let's go.

39:23.328 --> 39:26.696
Hey, buddy.
Now, I'm Lex.

39:26.698 --> 39:28.932
Thanks for helping us out.

39:30.268 --> 39:31.434
This is
my friend,

39:31.436 --> 39:33.269
Dr. Lommers.

39:33.271 --> 39:34.671
Hello, Thomas.

39:35.674 --> 39:38.007
You're giving
a lot of people hope.

39:38.009 --> 39:39.409
I know.

39:39.411 --> 39:41.478
That's my superpower.

39:41.480 --> 39:42.946
It sure is.

39:44.349 --> 39:45.849
We did it.

39:45.851 --> 39:48.485
Yeah. We did it.

39:48.487 --> 39:49.152
Oh, and I got it.

39:49.154 --> 39:50.687
What?

39:50.689 --> 39:52.188
Movie under the stars.

39:52.190 --> 39:53.323
(chuckles)

39:53.325 --> 39:54.424
Literally the perfect date.

39:54.426 --> 39:55.959
You in?

39:55.961 --> 39:57.293
You ready, pal?

39:57.295 --> 39:58.762
Okay.

40:01.933 --> 40:03.700
Step away from the boy.

40:03.702 --> 40:07.103
He needs to go back
inside right now.

40:09.174 --> 40:10.807
Miss Katie!

40:10.809 --> 40:11.841
Miss Katie!

40:11.843 --> 40:13.576
Miss Katie!

40:13.578 --> 40:14.644
What's happening?

40:14.646 --> 40:15.845
You need to take him back.

40:15.847 --> 40:17.447
WOMAN:
Hey, there's
a door there!

40:17.449 --> 40:18.715
They're letting people out!

40:18.717 --> 40:20.183
(people clamoring)
LEX: All right,

40:20.185 --> 40:21.184
you need to go back to Katie.

40:21.186 --> 40:21.985
Sorry, son.

40:25.590 --> 40:27.323
(muffled clamoring continues)

40:27.325 --> 40:28.458
Ma'am, stay
where you are.

40:28.460 --> 40:29.993
You've both
been exposed.

40:29.995 --> 40:32.729
It isn't right!
Let us out!
Stay there, Thomas,

40:32.731 --> 40:34.597
I'm coming!
Whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa.

40:34.599 --> 40:36.733
Let us out! Let us out!

40:36.735 --> 40:39.536
CANNERTS:
Don't touch him!

40:39.538 --> 40:42.505
Don't touch him.
Let us out!
Let us out!

40:42.507 --> 40:45.041
I was wrong.
(panting)

40:45.043 --> 40:46.276
I was wrong.

40:46.278 --> 40:50.380
Let us out!
Let us out!
(people clamoring)

40:50.382 --> 40:54.350
Stay back.
Stay back!

40:54.352 --> 40:55.819
Thomas is a carrier.

40:55.821 --> 40:58.221
You'll be quarantined
here for 48 hours.

40:58.223 --> 41:00.190
(scoffs)
Get out of my way.
(gun cocks)

41:03.028 --> 41:05.462
Don't test these guys.
I didn't even touch him.

41:07.799 --> 41:10.133
But I did.

41:14.940 --> 41:16.840
(beep)
Max, we have to meet.

41:16.842 --> 41:19.108
I got into Cannerts' apartment,
I found his lab notebook,

41:19.110 --> 41:21.211
and you're not gonna believe
what I've got, man.

41:21.213 --> 41:25.181
I think Cannerts
created the virus. Call me.

41:25.183 --> 41:26.549
(shouting, clamoring)

41:26.551 --> 41:29.652
(shouting)

41:41.733 --> 41:42.732
(pounding, clamoring continue)

41:42.734 --> 41:45.869
What the hell
is going on out there?

41:45.871 --> 41:49.205
What always happens
when people have no hope.

41:52.544 --> 41:53.977
They fight back.
