02:33.387 --> 02:35.154

02:38.893 --> 02:41.226
No pony's ever put
together a whole set.

02:41.228 --> 02:43.295
And I'm gonna be the first!

02:43.297 --> 02:44.830
If it hasn't been traded yet.

02:44.832 --> 02:46.932
It's the only one
in all of equestria.

02:46.934 --> 02:50.536
Oh no! I'd really hate to
see you disappointed.

02:50.538 --> 02:52.771
<i>I did want to trade this</i>

02:52.773 --> 02:54.473
<i>For a bird whistle.</i>

02:54.475 --> 02:57.209
But getting that book
seems so important to you.

02:57.211 --> 02:59.278
So if you need me
to help you first...

02:59.280 --> 03:01.280
Normally, I'd say I
don't need any help.

03:01.282 --> 03:03.549
But you're right: This
is really important.

03:03.551 --> 03:05.350
I've gotta get that book!

03:06.686 --> 03:09.955
Well, I'm off to take a gander
at some of the vintage stalls.

03:09.957 --> 03:11.390
Did you say vintage?

03:13.326 --> 03:16.695
Why, old and rare items
are so in style right now.

03:16.697 --> 03:19.198
I'm hoping to get a
vintage item as well.

03:19.200 --> 03:21.800
I just hope I brought
enough to trade.

03:21.802 --> 03:23.769
I know what you mean, rarity.

03:23.771 --> 03:27.306
Hey, why don't we pool
our trade stashes?

03:27.308 --> 03:28.640
Pool?

03:28.642 --> 03:30.842
That way, if one of us finds
something real valuable

03:30.844 --> 03:33.212
She can't live without...

03:33.214 --> 03:35.847
She'll definitely
be able to get it.

03:35.849 --> 03:38.283
Who could say no to
exchanging a single object

03:38.285 --> 03:40.352
For such a huge
assortment of items?

03:40.354 --> 03:43.422
Oh, yes, that is
absolutely brilliant.

03:43.424 --> 03:46.291
I'm so glad I have a
friend like you, applejack.

03:46.293 --> 03:47.859
I feel the same way.

03:47.861 --> 03:50.329
Then let's go shopping!

03:55.368 --> 03:57.436
Um, shouldn't your
princessness be heading

03:57.438 --> 03:59.404
To the royal box seats?

03:59.406 --> 04:02.474
I may be the princess on duty,
but I don't think that means

04:02.476 --> 04:04.943
I have to sit up there
all alone doing nothing.

04:04.945 --> 04:07.813
Ever since I became a princess,
celestia has been sending me

04:07.815 --> 04:09.548
More books to read than ever.

04:09.550 --> 04:10.949
<i>The library is overflowing.</i>

04:10.951 --> 04:15.420
I might as well trade away some
books I don't need any more.

04:15.422 --> 04:16.855
Mm hm!

04:19.392 --> 04:21.593
(gasp) there it is!

04:21.595 --> 04:24.730
The first edition of daring
do and the sapphire statue!

04:24.732 --> 04:26.531
It hasn't been traded yet!

04:26.533 --> 04:28.333
Lucky for you.

04:28.335 --> 04:30.702
Because I've brought my
most valuable possession

04:30.704 --> 04:32.471
To trade for it:

04:32.473 --> 04:33.472
<i>(clang)</i>

04:33.474 --> 04:35.274
<i>My lucky horse shoe.</i>

04:36.342 --> 04:37.376
I don't want it.

04:37.378 --> 04:39.044
What?

04:39.046 --> 04:40.846
It's just a rusty
old horse shoe.

04:40.848 --> 04:43.348
That's not worth
anything to me.

04:43.350 --> 04:48.387
But how is rainbow dash going to
get the book she really wants?

04:48.389 --> 04:49.655
Well, she's not.

04:49.657 --> 04:50.656
<i>(sigh)</i>

04:50.658 --> 04:51.657
<i>(thud)</i>

04:51.659 --> 04:52.958
Unless ...

04:52.960 --> 04:54.893
She can get me that.

04:55.695 --> 04:58.864
<i>(snarls)</i>

04:58.866 --> 05:01.366
Ooh, an orthros.

05:01.368 --> 05:02.534
<i>How cute.</i>

05:03.903 --> 05:05.771
The pony running the
ancient beast stall

05:05.773 --> 05:07.773
Doesn't want
anything I got.

05:07.775 --> 05:10.942
But if you can get
me the orthros,

05:10.944 --> 05:12.811
I'll trade you
the book for it.

05:14.681 --> 05:15.781
You got it!

05:17.750 --> 05:21.086
I don't know how, but somehow
we're gonna get that orthros.

05:27.493 --> 05:28.527
Oh, applejack!

05:28.529 --> 05:30.028
I am so glad I found you.

05:30.030 --> 05:31.630
Me, too. You're not
gonna believe it.

05:31.632 --> 05:35.367
I found a super valuable vintage
item I just have to have.

05:35.369 --> 05:37.636
And all it's going to
cost is all our stuff!

05:37.638 --> 05:39.004
Uh-oh.

05:41.074 --> 05:44.376
So where is this
valuable vintage item

05:44.378 --> 05:46.945
You want to trade
everything we have for?

05:46.947 --> 05:48.413
There.

05:49.882 --> 05:50.882
Where?

05:50.884 --> 05:51.950
Right there.

05:53.086 --> 05:55.987
But that's a dented
old pie tin.

05:55.989 --> 05:58.490
A dented vintage pie tin.

05:58.492 --> 06:00.992
The metal they used to fashion
this one helps cook the pies

06:00.994 --> 06:02.994
Up to five seconds faster.

06:02.996 --> 06:05.530
<i>They don't make 'em</i>
<i>like this anymore.</i>

06:05.532 --> 06:08.433
I am so glad you showed
that to me, darling.

06:08.435 --> 06:09.634
<i>(crash)</i>

06:09.636 --> 06:11.470
Because once you
see what I found,

06:11.472 --> 06:14.139
You won't want to waste
our trade goods on that.

06:14.141 --> 06:18.076
<i>Just look at this</i>
<i>gorgeous vintage brooch.</i>

06:18.078 --> 06:19.611
It's one of a kind.

06:21.748 --> 06:24.916
It looks exactly like the
one you're already wearing.

06:24.918 --> 06:26.852
Well, yes, they
may look the same.

06:26.854 --> 06:28.086
But I know it's older.

06:28.088 --> 06:30.455
That's what makes it
so much more divine.

06:30.457 --> 06:32.624
But that doesn't
make a lick of sense.

06:32.626 --> 06:34.526
Why I wager if I
switched 'em up,

06:34.528 --> 06:36.461
You wouldn't even
know the difference.

06:36.463 --> 06:38.430
Oh, don't be silly;
of course I would.

06:46.072 --> 06:48.573
So which is the vintage one?

06:49.909 --> 06:51.476
That one, of course.

06:52.645 --> 06:54.079
Ha! You're bluffin'.

06:54.081 --> 06:55.180
Am I?

06:55.182 --> 06:56.782
How can you tell?

06:56.784 --> 06:58.550
Well, because...

06:58.552 --> 07:00.185
Agh! I can't.

07:00.187 --> 07:02.721
'cause the one you want to
waste our whole stash on

07:02.723 --> 07:04.956
Is exactly the same as
the one you already got.

07:04.958 --> 07:07.192
There's no way anypony
would notice the difference.

07:08.561 --> 07:10.862
I'd say it's a lot more
likely they'd notice that

07:10.864 --> 07:12.864
Than some dented tin
that cooked a pie

07:12.866 --> 07:15.133
A whole two
seconds faster.

07:15.135 --> 07:17.202
It's five
seconds faster!

07:20.573 --> 07:23.041
<i>(growling)</i>

07:23.043 --> 07:24.109
<i>(snap)</i>

07:29.615 --> 07:31.450

07:36.656 --> 07:39.157
Yes, such a good
two-headed boy.

07:39.159 --> 07:40.692
Yes you are.

07:42.629 --> 07:45.597
Come on! Don't you
start now, too.

07:49.001 --> 07:52.471
Ok, I can see you're busy, so
I'll give it to you straight.

07:52.473 --> 07:56.475
I need to trade this
horse shoe for ...That.

07:56.477 --> 07:57.876
Nope.

07:57.878 --> 07:59.578
<i>(groan)</i>

07:59.580 --> 08:00.579
Down boy!

08:00.581 --> 08:01.780
Watch out for the lamp.

08:03.049 --> 08:04.883
<i>(smash)</i>

08:04.885 --> 08:07.586
Well, I could use
another lamp.

08:10.189 --> 08:13.492
<i>A whole stand filled with</i>
<i>discord-shaped lamps?</i>

08:13.494 --> 08:15.527
Seriously?

08:15.529 --> 08:18.530
They really do have everything
at the traders exchange.

08:18.532 --> 08:20.732
Will you trade a lamp
for my horse shoe,

08:20.734 --> 08:23.268
So I can trade it for an
orthros and get my book?

08:23.270 --> 08:24.669
No.

08:25.571 --> 08:27.772
But I'd trade it for
an antique chicken.

08:27.774 --> 08:28.907
Great!

08:30.109 --> 08:31.776
What's an antique chicken?

08:32.945 --> 08:36.214
Oh, I got all kinds of
antique chicken statues:

08:36.216 --> 08:39.117
I got your blue hens,
speckled greys, your...

08:39.119 --> 08:42.087
So will you trade
one for a horse shoe,

08:42.089 --> 08:45.257
So I can trade it for a lamp and
<i>then trade it for an orthros</i>

08:45.259 --> 08:46.658
<i>So I can get my book?</i>

08:46.660 --> 08:48.927
Well, let me think.

08:48.929 --> 08:50.896
Uh, no.

08:50.898 --> 08:55.534
But I'd gladly trade one of my
chickens for a crystal chalice.

08:57.737 --> 08:58.870
<i>(panting)</i>

08:58.872 --> 08:59.938
Hang on a sec.

08:59.940 --> 09:03.208
<i>We need a crystal chalice</i>
<i>to trade for a chicken</i>

09:03.210 --> 09:05.310
<i>To trade for a lamp to</i>
<i>trade for an orthros.</i>

09:05.312 --> 09:07.646
So what are you
willing to trade for?

09:07.648 --> 09:09.814
I'm guessing it's gotta
be some crazy thing

09:09.816 --> 09:11.816
Way across the exchange.

09:11.818 --> 09:15.120
Actually, I could use a
slightly rusty old horse shoe.

09:16.289 --> 09:18.323
Yeah, but where am
I gonna find...Wait!

09:18.325 --> 09:19.691
I've got one of those!

09:21.594 --> 09:24.129
Now that we've got the chalice,
this is gonna be a cinch.

09:24.131 --> 09:27.832
All we gotta do is bring this
thing to the chicken stand

09:27.834 --> 09:28.833
And we are--

09:28.835 --> 09:30.268
<i>(smash)</i>

09:30.270 --> 09:31.703
<i>(horrified scream)</i>

09:34.640 --> 09:37.576
You want me to trade all
my books for a broken pen?

09:40.079 --> 09:42.080
All right fine, you got
yourself a dea--

09:42.082 --> 09:43.982
Stop! What are you doing?

09:43.984 --> 09:47.118
I was trying to get rid of all
the books I don't need anymore.

09:47.120 --> 09:48.286
For that?

09:48.288 --> 09:51.790
Do you really want that?

09:51.792 --> 09:54.225
Well, not really.

09:54.227 --> 09:56.027
But I'm running out of
library space, so-

09:56.029 --> 09:57.896
Oh my gosh! Oh my gosh!
Oh my gosh!

09:57.898 --> 09:59.064
I can't believe that
almost happened.

09:59.066 --> 10:00.732
But luckily it didn't happen.

10:00.734 --> 10:01.766
Thanks to me.

10:01.768 --> 10:03.335
What are you talking about?

10:03.337 --> 10:05.036
According to the
rules of the exchange,

10:05.038 --> 10:07.138
A trade is only fair
if both ponies end up

10:07.140 --> 10:08.340
With something they want.

10:08.342 --> 10:10.108
You can't break
the rules.

10:11.177 --> 10:12.644
Did anypony see you do it?

10:12.646 --> 10:14.245
I don't think anypony saw.

10:15.781 --> 10:18.016
But you're not going to
say anything, are you?

10:18.018 --> 10:19.017
Just kidding.

10:19.019 --> 10:20.018
Or am I?

10:20.020 --> 10:21.219
Sometimes I can't
even tell...

10:23.356 --> 10:25.323
You know, if you
want to go check out

10:25.325 --> 10:27.859
The rest of the exchange and
trade whatever you brought...

10:27.861 --> 10:30.161
Nope. I just came
to pony watch.

10:30.163 --> 10:31.863
I'm not going anywhere.

10:31.865 --> 10:33.965
I won't let you make a
mistake like that again.

10:36.802 --> 10:37.902
Hey, everypony!

10:37.904 --> 10:39.004
Step right up.

10:39.006 --> 10:42.974
Gallop over here for your
chance to trade for authentic,

princess merchandise!

10:52.818 --> 10:54.653

11:01.327 --> 11:02.894
This is perfect!

11:03.863 --> 11:04.896
<i>(smash)</i>

11:04.898 --> 11:08.900

antique chicken do you want?

11:12.372 --> 11:14.439
<i>I got speckled, brown, grey...</i>

11:14.441 --> 11:17.709
The pony we're supposed to
trade the chicken statue to

11:17.711 --> 11:19.344
Didn't tell us what
kind he wanted.

11:19.346 --> 11:20.945
Ok, look, I'm fast.

11:20.947 --> 11:23.048
I'll fly over to the
lamp stand and find out

11:23.050 --> 11:28.319
Just don't let anypony trade for
any chicken while I'm gone, ok?

11:28.321 --> 11:30.355
Um, well, ok.

11:30.357 --> 11:31.823
Um, I can do that.

11:31.825 --> 11:32.891
I think.

11:36.062 --> 11:38.997
Uh, well, maybe you
shouldn't get one of those.

11:40.933 --> 11:43.201
Um, you know, unless
you really want to.

11:46.405 --> 11:47.472

Well, since we can't
both get what we want,

11:57.284 --> 11:58.983
I will be the
better friend.

11:58.985 --> 12:01.886
You take our trade goods

12:01.888 --> 12:03.488
I'm an amazin' friend.

12:03.490 --> 12:05.457
So even though it's fer
somethin' that don't seem

12:05.459 --> 12:08.393

you take our stash.

12:08.395 --> 12:10.328

12:10.330 --> 12:12.297

do you think I am?

12:12.299 --> 12:14.065
You're going to
get what you want.

12:14.067 --> 12:15.266
No, you are.

12:15.268 --> 12:16.801

Big fat zero.

12:40.927 --> 12:41.993

12:41.995 --> 12:43.928
Then she read these
books and voila!

12:43.930 --> 12:45.497

12:45.499 --> 12:47.532
So who wants to
start the bidding?

12:47.534 --> 12:48.533
Me!

12:48.535 --> 12:49.534

your help and all.

12:57.077 --> 12:59.043
But I'm not sure I'm
comfortable with this.

12:59.045 --> 13:00.512
No pony should
trade for my books

13:00.514 --> 13:02.447
Just because I'm a princess.

13:02.449 --> 13:04.516

13:08.288 --> 13:09.921
Just leave this to me.

13:09.923 --> 13:12.924
Oh, did I mention that princess
twilight got these books

13:12.926 --> 13:15.960
From princess celestia?

13:15.962 --> 13:17.061
Whoa, wait!

13:17.063 --> 13:18.163
You don't mean?

13:18.165 --> 13:21.866
Oh, that's right:
Double princess.

your break and all,

13:36.883 --> 13:38.249
But you've got to
open your stand

and the sapphire statue.

21:15.708 --> 21:17.642
It's just a beat
up old paperback,

21:17.644 --> 21:19.944
Not a one-of-a-kind
first edition.

21:19.946 --> 21:20.945
<i>(gasp)</i>

21:20.947 --> 21:22.413
Even better!

21:22.415 --> 21:26.484
Because I can read this
one with all my friends.

21:28.954 --> 21:30.021
<i>(giggle)</i>
