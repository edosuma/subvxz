01:16.824 --> 01:19.361
Which boxes?

01:19.461 --> 01:24.265
Those are... Those are
my photos, my negatives.

01:24.365 --> 01:28.134
Okay, well, that's because it used
to be my closet, David, so...

01:30.604 --> 01:34.342
What do you need the closet space
for anyway? Is she moving in there?

01:47.121 --> 01:49.524
This is it, this is it

01:54.462 --> 01:56.064
This is it

02:06.336 --> 02:08.473
Hello?

02:09.610 --> 02:13.913
Amy, are you up? It's almost noon.

02:15.282 --> 02:20.488
So I ordered these big Wanguni lips...

02:20.588 --> 02:22.424
the sculptor...

02:22.524 --> 02:24.492
three months ago for the new room.

02:24.592 --> 02:28.163
It's a glass sculpture by Bob Wanguni.

02:28.263 --> 02:31.633
These giant lips...
He's known for his lips, Wanguni.

02:31.733 --> 02:36.235
So today I get a call... it's gonna take
another 10 weeks for them to get here.

02:40.941 --> 02:43.244
So we're having a dinner...

02:43.344 --> 02:45.513
for a possible client and his wife.

02:45.613 --> 02:47.115
Okay.

02:47.215 --> 02:49.417
They're staying here for
the summer, with their son.

02:49.517 --> 02:51.152
And...

02:51.252 --> 02:53.186
I'm not saying you... you can't come.

02:55.222 --> 02:58.860
- What are you not saying?
- Well, I'm not not saying anything.

02:58.960 --> 03:01.396
I'm saying, of course, you can come.
You're living here.

03:01.496 --> 03:04.199
- I'm staying here.
- Well, at some point,

03:04.299 --> 03:05.867
I don't know what the difference is?

03:07.735 --> 03:13.308
Look, honey, I need you to...
shape up a little.

03:13.408 --> 03:17.145
- What?
- I need you to get something nice to wear.

03:17.245 --> 03:19.147
Oh, Mom, I'm...

03:19.247 --> 03:22.550
Look, I have offered to take you
shopping many times.

03:22.650 --> 03:26.888
I cannot have you walking around at this
dinner party in the same shabby T-shirt.

03:26.988 --> 03:29.691
Come on. I need you to make an effort.

03:29.791 --> 03:32.360
I just don't really feel like
going shopping right now.

03:32.460 --> 03:36.295
Do you think that Daddy feels like wining
and dining some New York lawyer at his age?

03:37.798 --> 03:40.468
I'm just kind of having a hard time
at the moment, Mom.

03:40.568 --> 03:42.001
I know.

03:43.670 --> 03:46.808
Look, I... I talked to Phyllis Nagel.
You know Jennifer.

03:46.908 --> 03:49.344
Jennifer's really having
a hard time too.

03:49.444 --> 03:51.746
Her new... second novel...

03:51.846 --> 03:54.215
is being published by some dinky press.

03:54.315 --> 03:56.551
She's very distraught.

03:56.651 --> 04:00.488
So she's taking something for it.

04:00.588 --> 04:02.457
Some...

04:02.557 --> 04:04.826
antidepressant or something.

04:04.926 --> 04:09.364
Just to help her
with the difficult transition.

04:09.464 --> 04:13.466
Amy, you haven't left
the house in three months.

04:18.738 --> 04:21.374
It's so good to see you
out of the house, Amy.

04:23.343 --> 04:26.881
Caley is gonna be so excited.
She insisted that you come.

04:26.981 --> 04:29.551
Did she?

04:29.651 --> 04:33.721
Oh, Aims, I... I ran into,

04:33.821 --> 04:35.957
Monica Cohen, Jessica's mom.

04:36.057 --> 04:42.597
She told me that Jessica is
taking a yoga teacher training.

04:42.697 --> 04:45.733
I thought that might be
something you could do.

04:45.833 --> 04:49.470
I don't even take yoga, Mom.

04:49.570 --> 04:51.239
Well, you could try.

04:51.339 --> 04:52.974
You know, Noah and Missy...

04:53.074 --> 04:55.310
are gonna want you to babysit for them.

04:55.410 --> 04:56.544
- Pull over.
- What?

04:56.644 --> 04:59.045
- Oh, God.
- Oh, God.

05:06.720 --> 05:09.490
- Hi.
- Hey. Get a bucket.

05:09.590 --> 05:11.593
Some water, ammonia, some rags.

05:11.693 --> 05:13.761
Oh, God. It's awful.

05:13.861 --> 05:15.428
Where's Amy?

05:18.899 --> 05:21.769
It's totally genetic.
Noah always gets carsick when I drive.

05:23.638 --> 05:25.473
Hear about this big client
we're trying to get, Amy?

05:25.573 --> 05:28.243
I told her she has to get
something to wear for the dinner.

05:28.343 --> 05:30.645
She knows, Mom. She's done a
thousand of these things for David.

05:30.745 --> 05:33.612
- Noah.
- What? What, I can't even say his name?

05:34.881 --> 05:36.484
Hi.

05:36.584 --> 05:38.553
- Oh, there she is!
- Hi.

05:38.653 --> 05:41.456
Ooh, I'm gonna get you.
I'm gonna get you, get you, get you.

05:41.556 --> 05:45.460
- Don't get me, Granny!
- I'm gonna get you!

05:45.560 --> 05:47.996
Amy, seriously. You gotta snap
out of this thing for the party.

05:48.096 --> 05:51.633
Look, if the office gets this client,
Dad gets to retire.

05:51.733 --> 05:55.570
He's gotta retire, Amy.
I am suffocating.

05:55.670 --> 05:57.803
Just get something nice to wear, okay?

06:05.979 --> 06:07.913
Something to wear.

06:12.686 --> 06:14.856
- Hey, Amy.
- Hey, Gary.

06:14.956 --> 06:18.359
Your mom said to tell you that
she took the Infinity to work out.

06:19.122 --> 06:20.528
Fuck.

06:20.628 --> 06:22.797
The fox went out on a chilly night

06:22.897 --> 06:25.466
And he prayed for the moon
to give him light

06:25.566 --> 06:28.503
He had many a mile to go that night

06:28.603 --> 06:30.905
Before he reached the town-o

06:31.005 --> 06:33.841
Town-o, town-o

06:33.941 --> 06:36.611
Many a mile to go that night

06:36.711 --> 06:39.178
Before he reached the town-o

06:42.449 --> 06:45.887
- Can I help you?
- Oh. Yeah.

06:45.987 --> 06:48.690
I just need a new T-shirt.

06:48.790 --> 06:51.492
We've got some new super
soft Pima cottons in today.

06:51.592 --> 06:53.993
Okay. Thanks.

07:06.640 --> 07:08.174
Shit.

07:13.815 --> 07:16.551
- Can you just take the shirt off?
- Sure. I'm...

07:16.651 --> 07:19.887
Yeah. Okay. Okay. I'm sorry.

07:19.987 --> 07:22.988
I mean... I'm not stealing it.

07:28.128 --> 07:29.385
Hey, Karen.

07:35.101 --> 07:36.669
It's Amy Minsky.

07:38.572 --> 07:42.775
Oh. We, went to West Farms together.

07:44.711 --> 07:47.913
I took the yearbook pictures of the
soccer team when you were cocaptain.

07:49.216 --> 07:51.919
Oh, yeah. Did you have glasses then?

07:52.019 --> 07:53.686
Yeah.

07:54.521 --> 07:55.857
And were you...

07:55.957 --> 07:57.592
Bigger.

07:57.692 --> 07:59.660
- That was you?
- Yeah.

07:59.760 --> 08:02.630
Oh, I can't believe it.

08:02.730 --> 08:05.400
- Look at me.
- Oh, wow.

08:05.500 --> 08:08.436
Can you believe it?
And I already have two kids.

08:08.536 --> 08:11.572
I'm like, "Scotty, get off."

08:11.672 --> 08:13.408
- Do you have kids?
- No, I don't. No.

08:13.508 --> 08:16.775
Wow. It changes everything.

08:19.080 --> 08:21.015
So, are you married?

08:21.115 --> 08:25.150
Well, I got divorced a few months ago.

08:26.086 --> 08:28.089
That's so sad. Who was he?

08:28.189 --> 08:30.990
He... I mean, he's not dead.

08:31.925 --> 08:33.594
- Oh.
- Just, like...

08:33.693 --> 08:37.597
- We're still friends and...
- That's awesome.

08:37.698 --> 08:39.967
If only it were true.

08:40.067 --> 08:42.904
Hey, a bunch of us still go out to
Viva's on Thursday night and get drunk.

08:43.004 --> 08:45.137
You should come. Girls' night.

08:50.310 --> 08:52.980
He ran till he came
to his nice warm den

08:53.080 --> 08:55.216
And there were the little ones,
eight, nine, 10

08:55.316 --> 08:57.852
Cryin' Dad, Dad,
you better go back again

08:57.952 --> 09:00.721
For it must be a mighty fine town-o

09:00.821 --> 09:03.558
Town-o, town-o

09:03.658 --> 09:05.660
Dad, Dad, you better go back again

09:05.760 --> 09:09.831
For it must be a mighty fine town-o

09:09.931 --> 09:12.633
The Fox and his wife,
without any strife

09:12.733 --> 09:15.102
Cut up the goose with a carving knife

09:15.202 --> 09:17.605
Never had such a meal in their life

09:17.705 --> 09:19.774
And the little ones chewed
on the bones-o

09:19.874 --> 09:21.709
Bones-o, bones-o

09:21.809 --> 09:25.513
- Amy!
- Never had such a meal in their life

09:25.613 --> 09:28.213
And the little ones chewed
on the bones-o

09:30.250 --> 09:33.087
Honey, are you... Oh.

09:33.187 --> 09:36.524
Come on. How can it just be stress?
What does she do all day long?

09:36.624 --> 09:39.160
I-I-I don't see
where this is going, Stan.

09:39.260 --> 09:42.797
She made a big mistake,
not taking alimony from David.

09:42.897 --> 09:45.900
No, no, no. She felt humiliated.

09:46.000 --> 09:48.769
She didn't want to take from him,
and I can take care of her.

09:48.869 --> 09:51.105
Oh. Oh, yeah. What if we
can't stay in this house?

09:51.205 --> 09:54.175
Are we all gonna move in
somewhere together?

09:54.275 --> 09:57.245
- Well, she doesn't need him.
- Well, she sure needs something.

09:57.345 --> 10:00.114
She left all of her stuff there
like a crazy person.

10:00.214 --> 10:03.718
I don't... I don't know where this comes...
She's uneducated, unmotivated...

10:03.818 --> 10:05.887
She's not uneducated.

10:05.987 --> 10:09.123
Well, that liberal arts degree
with that phony master's...

10:09.223 --> 10:11.292
Where's that going to get her?

10:50.730 --> 10:52.398
Yeah?

11:13.153 --> 11:15.020
You know she doesn't mean it.

11:19.525 --> 11:21.794
I just wish I didn't agree with her.

11:23.063 --> 11:25.397
Oh, come on.

11:28.201 --> 11:30.302
You just had some bad luck.

11:39.279 --> 11:42.617
You know I'm not good
at talking about things.

11:42.717 --> 11:45.119
You know...

11:47.354 --> 11:49.388
What can you do?

11:50.890 --> 11:52.958
That's all I know how to say.

11:54.094 --> 11:56.795
But it's kind of true too.

12:00.967 --> 12:02.501
Thanks, Dad.

12:06.005 --> 12:07.372
It's his loss.

12:09.109 --> 12:12.213
Just, you know, stick to the...

12:12.313 --> 12:14.226
- "What can you do?"
- Yeah.

12:22.822 --> 12:24.925
Remember when we used to...

12:25.025 --> 12:28.262
stay up late and watch all those
Marx Brothers movies together?

12:29.400 --> 12:31.664
When you were little?

12:32.466 --> 12:35.936
And you could never get up
for school the next day.

12:36.036 --> 12:38.904
Your mom would get so mad at me.
Oh, my God.

12:44.144 --> 12:47.348
What... What are the, clients?

12:47.448 --> 12:50.051
- What's the company you're trying to get?
- Oh.

12:50.151 --> 12:54.353
Yeah. Th-That's... That's a big
online thing that's about to go public.

12:56.189 --> 12:57.892
You know, if we get this client,

12:57.992 --> 13:01.729
we could make back some of the
money we lost in the market.

13:01.829 --> 13:05.199
I mean, we could keep the house and...

13:05.299 --> 13:07.468
Well, I could actually retire.

13:07.568 --> 13:10.404
Like we planned.

13:10.504 --> 13:16.043
Your mother wants to take this trip
around the world this fall.

13:16.143 --> 13:18.477
"Gallivanting the Globe" it's called.

13:19.512 --> 13:22.049
Oh, the trip has a name?

13:22.149 --> 13:24.183
All the best ones do.

13:25.585 --> 13:27.784
Apparently.

13:29.889 --> 13:31.123
Look...

13:31.925 --> 13:33.428
would you just...

13:34.528 --> 13:37.331
get a nice dress or something,
for Chrissakes?

13:37.431 --> 13:40.201
Yes, I know. I...

13:40.301 --> 13:42.303
Look, here.

13:42.403 --> 13:44.505
Oh. No, Dad.

13:44.605 --> 13:46.974
I'll just borrow something. Please.

13:47.074 --> 13:50.511
Then... Then just keep it. Okay?

13:50.611 --> 13:54.381
- Whose happiness are you buying?
- Mine.

13:58.418 --> 14:00.054
Then I'll take it.

14:00.154 --> 14:01.489
Take whatever you want.

14:01.589 --> 14:04.158
- Thanks, Missy.
- Yeah.

14:12.332 --> 14:14.132
Hey, can I try this one?

14:15.401 --> 14:17.135
Go for it, Aim.

14:39.559 --> 14:41.428
Fuck.

14:41.528 --> 14:44.565
Oh, it's a great house.
How long have you been here?

14:44.665 --> 14:47.101
Well, we've been here about five years.

14:47.201 --> 14:50.271
And we're going room by room.
It's such a mess.

14:50.371 --> 14:53.307
And the people before... it's as if they
had no idea they were on the water.

14:53.407 --> 14:55.209
There was no use of the views.

14:55.309 --> 14:58.279
And it was supposed to be
finished last week, of course.

14:58.379 --> 15:00.381
Of course. I mean, sometimes I think...

15:01.476 --> 15:05.853
Aren't contractors aware that everybody
is talking about them in this way?

15:06.695 --> 15:07.822
Doesn't it bother them?

15:07.922 --> 15:10.591
And does it bother you the way
they talk about lawyers, Stan?

15:16.430 --> 15:18.497
Amy, what do you do?

15:19.499 --> 15:22.203
Not much.

15:28.207 --> 15:30.444
No. I mean...

15:30.544 --> 15:34.513
Originally, a long, long time ago,
I was a lit major.

15:36.449 --> 15:39.320
And then I went to grad school
for photography.

15:39.420 --> 15:41.188
So...

15:41.288 --> 15:43.557
I was just trying to see how many
things I could major in...

15:43.657 --> 15:45.159
that would never make me any money.

15:47.061 --> 15:49.630
Are you familiar with the
work of Robert Mapplethorpe?

15:49.730 --> 15:52.233
Yeah, I am. Yeah.

15:52.333 --> 15:54.368
Well, Jeremy here is an actor,

15:54.468 --> 15:57.037
and he recently played
Mapplethorpe in a play.

15:57.137 --> 15:58.505
Oh, for heaven's sakes.

15:58.605 --> 16:00.307
Oh, that's a good segue.

16:00.407 --> 16:02.977
- Well...
- That's impressive.

16:03.077 --> 16:06.180
But Jeremy, of course, got to know
his work very well and he loved it.

16:06.280 --> 16:08.949
But I just find it so unsettling.

16:09.049 --> 16:12.319
What do you think, Amy?

16:12.419 --> 16:15.890
Yeah, some of the
images are shocking. Yeah.

16:20.226 --> 16:23.330
But I think because he gives the
shocking images the same attention as...

16:23.430 --> 16:26.100
as he does his... his flowers,

16:26.200 --> 16:29.203
you know, that the shocking
images become really kind of...

16:29.303 --> 16:30.502
beautiful.

16:31.304 --> 16:32.907
Yeah.

16:33.007 --> 16:35.910
I don't know. I think he's
a master, really. Honestly.

16:36.010 --> 16:39.013
Amy would have made a great lawyer.
I've always told her that.

16:39.113 --> 16:41.315
Well, I make a pretty
good lawyer, right? Right?

16:41.415 --> 16:45.152
- Pretty good.
- Oh!

16:45.252 --> 16:47.087
- More red?
- Yeah, thank you.

16:47.187 --> 16:49.154
It's good for you.

16:51.057 --> 16:54.092
- Yeah, the antioxidants, right?
- That's right.

16:58.431 --> 17:01.535
Well, you know, all those studies
come from the wine companies though.

17:01.635 --> 17:04.271
- Oh, no.
- That can't be true, Amy.

17:04.371 --> 17:06.240
That would be illegal, right?

17:06.339 --> 17:10.711
Otherwise, companies would just go
around making unsubstantiated claims.

17:10.810 --> 17:13.213
- Isn't that right, Stan?
- You bet.

17:17.650 --> 17:19.420
I read that too.

17:19.520 --> 17:22.119
- Yeah?
- I did.

17:25.191 --> 17:29.263
Jeremy, would we have seen you
in anything else, acting-wise?

17:29.363 --> 17:32.433
He was in a TV show for a long time.

17:32.533 --> 17:34.201
- It was for kids.
- Ooh.

17:34.301 --> 17:36.136
It was called In the Garden.

17:36.236 --> 17:39.828
I knew it. You are Mr. Green!

17:41.475 --> 17:44.211
Oh, you know, Caley watches that show.

17:44.311 --> 17:46.647
In da Garden where da world is green

17:46.747 --> 17:48.382
Yeah?

17:48.482 --> 17:50.584
Lives a man who you have never seen

17:50.684 --> 17:53.053
- That's you, right?
- Oh, yeah!

17:53.153 --> 17:54.989
- I love it!
- Yes.

17:55.089 --> 17:56.991
Do you ever do any Broadway musicals?

17:57.091 --> 17:59.560
- He's far too serious.
- You have such a good voice.

17:59.660 --> 18:02.329
- I wish he would though.
- Thank you.

18:02.429 --> 18:05.099
Truth be told,
I was actually an actress.

18:05.399 --> 18:08.148
- Really?
- Oh, I know. Hard to believe.

18:09.436 --> 18:14.041
I had to give it up though when,
Jeremy's dad and I divorced.

18:14.141 --> 18:17.144
It was just too difficult.
I had to get a real job.

18:17.244 --> 18:19.380
Thank goodness for Jeremy.

18:19.480 --> 18:21.482
Otherwise I would have...
I don't know... killed myself.

18:23.517 --> 18:25.786
Jeremy, is everything
okay with your food?

18:25.886 --> 18:27.788
Jeremy's a vegan.

18:27.888 --> 18:30.591
- Oh, no.
- Lord, I should have asked. I'm so sorry.

18:30.691 --> 18:32.526
- It is such a pain in the ass. Honestly.
- It's okay.

18:32.626 --> 18:34.728
Well, Amy will eat anything
you put in front of her,

18:34.828 --> 18:37.097
although she'll starve
herself for dessert, right?

18:37.197 --> 18:39.433
Especially chocolates, right, Aim?

18:39.533 --> 18:42.169
When she was a little girl,
I used to have to hide the chocolate,

18:42.269 --> 18:44.271
'cause she would eat it all.

18:45.049 --> 18:46.471
I'm sorry. I just...

18:54.580 --> 18:57.785
- She's been having sort of a rough time recently.
- She's going through a divorce.

18:57.885 --> 19:01.055
Oh, my gosh. I'm so sorry.
I was going on and on...

19:01.155 --> 19:03.057
Oh, it's all right. It's all right.

19:03.157 --> 19:05.259
Does she have any kids?

19:05.359 --> 19:07.061
There was a miscarriage.

19:20.640 --> 19:21.640
You.

19:28.314 --> 19:29.514
Hi.

19:30.483 --> 19:32.453
Hey.

19:32.553 --> 19:35.422
I like... I like your dress.

19:35.522 --> 19:37.624
It's my sister-in-law's dress.

19:37.724 --> 19:39.391
Yeah.

19:51.237 --> 19:55.209
Jeremy? Are you in there?

19:55.309 --> 19:57.478
What are you doing? It's so dark.

19:57.578 --> 19:59.179
Are you okay?

19:59.279 --> 20:00.681
- I'm just...
- What, honey?

20:00.781 --> 20:03.317
I don't know. I feel a little anxious.

20:03.417 --> 20:05.486
Oh, my God, it's me.

20:05.586 --> 20:08.889
I shouldn't have mentioned that show.
I'm so proud of you, it gives me Tourette's.

20:08.989 --> 20:11.825
- No, no. It's okay.
- Oh, gosh, I'm sorry.

20:11.925 --> 20:14.394
- Honey, you feel really warm.
- No, it's okay.

20:14.494 --> 20:16.595
Come on, let's go get you water.

20:18.831 --> 20:22.136
- Hey, Larry, thank you so much for coming.
- It was so nice.

20:22.236 --> 20:23.904
Oh, no, no, no. Thank you.
This... This was great.

20:24.004 --> 20:25.639
Oh, thank you.

20:25.739 --> 20:28.642
It was lovely. And thank you
for including the whole family.

20:28.742 --> 20:30.410
Look, we're family people.

20:30.510 --> 20:33.680
We haven't spent a summer in
Westport since Jeremy was 14.

20:33.780 --> 20:36.316
Well, you know, Noah and Amy...

20:36.416 --> 20:40.187
could give Jeremy some pointers on some
of the new hot spots for young people.

20:40.287 --> 20:41.889
- Yes.
- Except we're not young anymore.

20:41.989 --> 20:44.291
- Oh, stop.
- You're younger than we are.

20:44.391 --> 20:46.693
That's not saying much, Stan.
Good night.

20:46.793 --> 20:48.929
- Good night. So long.
- Amy.

20:49.029 --> 20:50.764
- It was lovely to meet you.
- Oh.

20:50.864 --> 20:53.634
- I feel terrible about what I said before.
- Oh.

20:53.734 --> 20:58.439
Listen, if you need to talk to someone
about your divorce or anything,

20:58.540 --> 21:01.909
- just give me a call. I've been there.
- You call us anytime, all right?

21:02.009 --> 21:04.776
- Of course. Good night.
- Good night.

21:12.885 --> 21:14.388
You're up early.

21:14.488 --> 21:16.757
Am I?

21:16.857 --> 21:19.259
- What a great night?
- Let's hope it helps.

21:19.359 --> 21:21.461
It'll help.
Wasn't it a great night, Aim?

21:21.561 --> 21:23.728
Nice people.

21:26.065 --> 21:27.632
Are you working on Saturday?

21:28.868 --> 21:30.771
Yeah. I have to go in.

21:30.871 --> 21:34.342
Gwen Hammer called this morning, Amy.

21:34.442 --> 21:36.944
- Who?
- The woman who was here last night.

21:37.044 --> 21:40.747
- Jeremy Hammer's mother. Larry's wife.
- Oh, yeah.

21:40.847 --> 21:45.552
She wants to know if you'll show
Jeremy around town.

21:45.652 --> 21:47.888
- Wh-What's there to show?
- I don't know, Amy.

21:47.988 --> 21:50.324
- She asked, so...
- I think it sounds like a great idea.

21:50.424 --> 21:52.359
See you later.

21:52.459 --> 21:53.925
Bye.

21:54.593 --> 21:55.960
So?

21:57.830 --> 21:58.770
So?

21:59.700 --> 22:02.302
I need to know what
to say to Gwen Hammer.

22:02.402 --> 22:05.103
Will you show Jeremy Hammer around?

22:10.976 --> 22:13.044
Hi.

22:27.560 --> 22:29.663
Sweet ride.

22:29.763 --> 22:31.029
Thanks.

22:35.835 --> 22:39.738
So, this is the quaint Main Street.

22:40.840 --> 22:42.809
It's pretty quaint.

22:42.909 --> 22:45.779
Well, it's very quaint.
It's very quaint.

22:45.879 --> 22:49.316
There's a quaint little inn so that,
people from the city...

22:49.416 --> 22:52.686
can experience quaintness...

22:52.786 --> 22:54.886
for $500 a night.

22:57.656 --> 22:59.023
You're divorced?

23:03.897 --> 23:05.597
I am.

23:06.565 --> 23:08.035
What's that like?

23:08.135 --> 23:12.470
Which... Which thing?
Being married or being...

23:14.106 --> 23:15.676
I...

23:15.776 --> 23:18.777
I... I don't know. I... I...
I loved being married.

23:20.045 --> 23:21.613
I was happy.

23:22.615 --> 23:24.685
I guess my husband wasn't.

23:24.785 --> 23:26.453
I had the...

23:27.453 --> 23:29.856
rug pulled out from under me.

23:29.956 --> 23:32.726
Or the wool pulled over my eyes,
or one of those.

23:32.826 --> 23:34.461
I had the...

23:34.561 --> 23:37.064
Maybe I had the rug pulled over my eyes.

23:39.699 --> 23:43.134
My God, I don't know why I'm
telling you this. I'm sorry.

23:43.836 --> 23:45.870
I asked.

23:47.106 --> 23:48.673
I'm interested.

23:51.544 --> 23:52.913
And... And so you...

23:53.013 --> 23:55.082
you did photography?

23:55.182 --> 23:58.883
Yeah. I mean, like, a long time ago.

24:00.152 --> 24:01.688
What were your pictures of?

24:03.723 --> 24:05.592
Rivers.

24:05.692 --> 24:08.528
Water. Mostly rivers.

24:11.897 --> 24:14.901
I was... I was going
to do this, thing.

24:15.001 --> 24:19.938
Like a collection of
my "work" or whatever.

24:21.106 --> 24:22.943
You know, it was kind of like a thesis.

24:23.043 --> 24:26.911
It was gonna be like my thesis,
but I did not finish it.

24:27.680 --> 24:28.915
Why not?

24:29.015 --> 24:33.754
Well, I met David,
and we got engaged and...

24:33.854 --> 24:37.924
He was this big, like, celebrity,
like, entertainment lawyer,

24:38.024 --> 24:40.925
so we had to have all these parties
all the time for his clients, and...

24:42.595 --> 24:45.997
We bought a place.
We had to redo the kitchen.

24:47.266 --> 24:49.067
Do you want to go to the beach?

24:55.674 --> 24:57.175
Amy?

26:22.761 --> 26:24.829
Okay.

26:25.931 --> 26:27.365
Well, good luck this summer.

26:29.602 --> 26:30.969
Can I see you again?

26:33.339 --> 26:34.574
No.

26:34.674 --> 26:36.076
I mean...

26:36.176 --> 26:40.146
I think this was a bit, crazy.

26:40.246 --> 26:42.148
No.

26:42.248 --> 26:43.216
Just...

26:43.316 --> 26:45.151
Please?

26:45.251 --> 26:46.820
- "Please."
- Really, "Please"?

26:46.920 --> 26:48.722
What?

26:48.822 --> 26:50.688
My mother raised me to be polite.

26:53.726 --> 26:55.325
She didn't do a very good job.

27:00.366 --> 27:03.768
- I'm just really busy.
- Busy?

27:04.336 --> 27:06.237
Yep.

27:07.072 --> 27:08.909
I'm busy.

27:09.009 --> 27:12.045
"'Oh, dear. Oh, dear, I cannot hear.

27:12.145 --> 27:13.880
Will you please come over near?

27:13.980 --> 27:16.216
Will you please look in my ear?

27:16.316 --> 27:19.319
There must be something there, dear.'

27:19.419 --> 27:22.889
"'Say, look. A bird was in your ear.

27:22.989 --> 27:25.725
But he is out, so have no fear.

27:25.825 --> 27:30.230
Again your ear can hear, my dear.'"

27:30.330 --> 27:32.999
Says the other character, right?
So I have to have other voices.

27:33.099 --> 27:34.634
Right?

27:40.039 --> 27:41.873
Hey.

27:45.978 --> 27:47.879
Are you there?

27:51.183 --> 27:52.884
Do you wanna come over tomorrow?

27:59.958 --> 28:01.361
Don't worry. There's nobody here.

28:01.461 --> 28:03.063
Just...

28:03.163 --> 28:05.899
Is there a more private place
we can... be?

28:05.999 --> 28:08.301
Okay. All right, don't freak out.

28:08.401 --> 28:11.038
I haven't been in this room since I was 12.

28:12.038 --> 28:14.338
- Oh, my God.
- What?

28:15.307 --> 28:17.110
This was a mistake.

28:18.300 --> 28:19.746
Oh, my God.

28:19.846 --> 28:21.681
Why?

28:21.781 --> 28:25.183
Look, you are a lot younger than me,
in... in case you haven't noticed.

28:26.385 --> 28:30.190
I've been with older women before, okay?

28:30.290 --> 28:33.057
- You have?
- Yeah.

28:34.159 --> 28:35.960
Really? Who?

28:39.798 --> 28:43.236
My on-set tutor, Mrs. Botstein.

28:55.114 --> 28:57.917
This just... It...

28:58.017 --> 29:00.151
can't be, like, a thing.

29:02.254 --> 29:04.958
- A what?
- Do... Like a...

29:05.058 --> 29:06.758
Like a, you know. Like...

29:08.160 --> 29:11.129
- What, a shell game?
- No.

29:13.999 --> 29:16.870
My dad is trying to get these
clients from your stepdad...

29:16.970 --> 29:18.738
I have no relationship with that guy.

29:18.838 --> 29:20.807
Okay, but I have a
relationship with my dad.

29:20.907 --> 29:22.876
And it happens to be, like,

29:22.976 --> 29:26.911
the only good relationship
in my life, so...

29:28.213 --> 29:30.982
Well, nobody has to know.

29:32.918 --> 29:35.255
I don't lie to my parents, okay?

29:35.355 --> 29:37.321
I don't sneak around.

29:44.396 --> 29:48.234
Gwen Hammer called, Amy,
to thank you for showing Jeremy around.

29:48.334 --> 29:51.738
- She said he had a really good time.
- Of course he did.

29:52.876 --> 29:56.276
He's playing Walt Whitman
in a play in New York this fall.

29:56.376 --> 29:58.745
Apparently he's very talented.

29:58.845 --> 30:02.148
Really, I, frankly... I think she
goes a little over the top, you know?

30:02.248 --> 30:03.767
Like he's God's gift.

30:04.518 --> 30:07.020
- Sounds like you two bonded.
- No, I wouldn't go that far.

30:07.120 --> 30:09.989
I mean, she likes to talk.
She's very open.

30:10.089 --> 30:12.859
She's a therapist.
You know how they are.

30:12.959 --> 30:16.730
Yeah, she said she's worried
about him blowing his career.

30:16.830 --> 30:20.834
She says she's always worried about him
because he's gay and everything.

30:20.934 --> 30:23.436
Apparently it's very hard for gay teenagers.

30:26.272 --> 30:28.241
Amy. Stan!

30:28.341 --> 30:29.258
Heimlich!

30:38.851 --> 30:41.187
Amy.

30:41.287 --> 30:42.922
What is so funny?

30:45.491 --> 30:47.058
Oh, stop.

30:50.162 --> 30:51.495
Dad.

31:08.881 --> 31:10.548
What?

31:12.017 --> 31:14.154
You're awake?

31:14.254 --> 31:16.156
I'm always awake.

31:17.056 --> 31:18.822
What is it?

31:19.490 --> 31:20.794
J...

31:20.894 --> 31:22.896
Just...

31:22.996 --> 31:24.929
I have to go out.

31:26.164 --> 31:28.034
I have to go to the drugstore.

31:28.134 --> 31:31.538
There's Motrin and Aleve in the
top drawer, above the hair dryers.

31:31.638 --> 31:32.939
No.

31:34.607 --> 31:37.010
I-it's a prescription.

31:37.110 --> 31:39.477
I forgot it, to pick it up.

31:41.280 --> 31:43.147
What for?

31:44.549 --> 31:47.187
I'm starting some meds.

31:47.287 --> 31:50.655
You... You know, for...
for my depression.

31:51.456 --> 31:54.027
- Oh.
- Yeah.

31:54.127 --> 32:00.033
So when you hear the garage door and the...
the ding-ding thing of the gate sensor...

32:00.133 --> 32:02.033
that's what it'll be.

32:02.668 --> 32:04.904
It's me...

32:05.004 --> 32:09.209
going out to pick up my antidepressants.

32:29.695 --> 32:32.465
I guess I was just...

32:32.565 --> 32:35.235
really good...

32:35.335 --> 32:37.503
at playing gay.

32:37.603 --> 32:39.239
You know?

32:39.339 --> 32:42.108
I guess I was just really convincing.

32:42.208 --> 32:46.012
You know, like, it was just a
gay part in a gay play, but...

32:46.112 --> 32:48.414
she...

32:48.514 --> 32:52.352
she just latched onto
the idea, like a...

32:52.452 --> 32:54.752
like a pit bull, and she
just wouldn't let it go.

32:56.989 --> 32:59.525
Oh, God. And...

32:59.625 --> 33:01.895
I had to take all my
clothes off in the play.

33:03.068 --> 33:04.397
All my clothes off.

33:04.497 --> 33:07.934
And she brought all these people
to come and see it.

33:08.034 --> 33:10.301
And they all sat in the front row.

33:11.336 --> 33:13.504
I saw them, they saw me.

33:15.507 --> 33:17.944
So embarrassing.

33:18.044 --> 33:20.980
But she just had this huge
smile on her face and...

33:21.080 --> 33:26.118
She was just... She was,
like, clapping so loudly.

33:26.218 --> 33:29.255
She's like the loudest clapper.

33:29.355 --> 33:33.226
But, I don't know.
I've never seen her that happy.

33:33.326 --> 33:37.163
She's really into being accepting, so...

33:37.263 --> 33:39.032
I just let her think I'm gay.

33:40.633 --> 33:42.333
And she gets to be accepting.

33:49.374 --> 33:54.213
Yeah, sometimes it's just easier,
you know, just to be...

33:54.313 --> 33:56.147
like what other people want you to be,

33:57.749 --> 33:59.650
rather than fight it.

34:02.120 --> 34:03.521
You know?

34:04.556 --> 34:06.557
You ever feel like that?

34:13.831 --> 34:15.735
What about your ex-husband?

34:15.835 --> 34:17.701
Why did you guys split up?

34:18.837 --> 34:21.040
Well,

34:21.139 --> 34:23.376
he had an affair...

34:23.476 --> 34:25.712
with a woman from his work.

34:27.480 --> 34:29.580
I thought she was my friend.

34:32.083 --> 34:36.688
They planned this, like,
surprise party for me, together.

34:36.789 --> 34:38.456
- Wow.
- Yeah.

34:39.224 --> 34:40.658
"Surprise."

34:43.360 --> 34:44.829
It was surprising.

34:46.864 --> 34:48.565
Why did he do that?

34:52.637 --> 34:55.840
I mean, I... I assumed
he was in love with her.

35:02.247 --> 35:04.784
I don't know. I...
You know, I fucked up somehow,

35:04.884 --> 35:09.186
and he wanted a divorce, so...

35:11.423 --> 35:13.324
Well, I think he fucked up.

35:19.264 --> 35:23.169
- So why can't you stay out?
- I just... I don't wanna get in trouble.

35:23.269 --> 35:26.470
I'll get in so much trouble.

35:27.539 --> 35:29.279
I can't.

35:36.414 --> 35:38.249
I wanna see you.

35:41.520 --> 35:43.287
You know?

35:48.660 --> 35:52.298
I want to see you come. Yeah?

35:56.768 --> 35:59.305
You know?

35:59.405 --> 36:02.508
I wanted to make

36:02.608 --> 36:05.611
Something built to last

36:05.711 --> 36:08.347
A bottled ship

36:08.447 --> 36:11.751
With a golden mast

36:11.851 --> 36:15.721
And through the squall

36:15.821 --> 36:19.459
- The course stays true
- What the fuck?

36:19.559 --> 36:21.258
Make something good

36:23.461 --> 36:27.831
I want to be able to walk in and, click...
all the lights go on at once. You know?

36:31.336 --> 36:36.473
It's gonna take a long, long time

36:37.909 --> 36:40.813
But we're gonna make something so fine

36:40.913 --> 36:44.484
I'm supposed to be learning my
lines for this Walt Whitman play.

36:44.584 --> 36:49.320
It's gonna take a long, long time

36:50.722 --> 36:54.894
But we're gonna make something so fine

36:54.994 --> 36:57.828
Nobody's following us.

37:04.736 --> 37:06.372
Thanks for taking me to work out.

37:06.472 --> 37:08.973
Well, getting fat doesn't
do anybody any good.

37:10.442 --> 37:13.746
- Can I quote you on that?
- You joke,

37:13.846 --> 37:18.015
but when I went to my Radcliffe reunion,
everybody was fat but me.

37:22.988 --> 37:25.825
Boy, those antidepressants are
getting you out of the house?

37:25.925 --> 37:27.491
That's good.

37:29.394 --> 37:32.863
So, think you're coming up
with a plan for yourself now?

37:44.010 --> 37:45.478
I...

37:45.778 --> 37:48.746
I already feel like I'm really stoned.

37:50.482 --> 37:55.052
I used to have to smoke pot
for so long to get stoned.

37:57.455 --> 37:59.757
Back in ye olden days.

38:02.060 --> 38:07.765
That's when I saw U2
at Nassau Coliseum, dude.

38:22.013 --> 38:23.981
Oh, shit.

38:26.084 --> 38:28.052
I'm supposed to do this play.

38:30.789 --> 38:32.556
You know?

38:34.693 --> 38:36.593
I got such a big part in this play.

38:37.896 --> 38:39.697
That's soon, I think, yeah?

39:10.628 --> 39:12.178
What?

39:14.899 --> 39:17.270
I hate smoking pot.

39:18.471 --> 39:19.970
I do too.

39:24.008 --> 39:25.945
I don't want to do it.

39:26.045 --> 39:28.912
Should we stop? Let's just stop.

39:29.914 --> 39:32.485
I don't want to do the play.

39:32.585 --> 39:35.853
Oh, my God. I do not want
to do this play, Amy.

39:37.088 --> 39:39.759
I don't want to play Walt Whitman.

39:40.923 --> 39:42.366
I just...

39:44.562 --> 39:46.766
I... hate...

39:46.866 --> 39:48.465
acting.

39:50.135 --> 39:52.636
- You do?
- I do.

39:54.506 --> 39:56.409
I do. I fucking hate it.

39:56.509 --> 39:57.743
- Jeremy...
- I hate it.

39:57.843 --> 40:00.746
You're, like...
You're standing up there...

40:00.846 --> 40:02.815
and then people are clapping for you.

40:02.915 --> 40:07.453
People are telling you what to say,
where to go and where to stand.

40:07.553 --> 40:09.455
And then they say, "Good job,"

40:09.555 --> 40:11.357
like... like... like...

40:11.457 --> 40:14.158
like I'm like a fucking toddler who
just learned how to use the toilet.

40:15.193 --> 40:17.563
So why? Why do you do it?

40:17.663 --> 40:20.399
I don't know. I don't know.

40:20.499 --> 40:22.065
Don't do it.

40:25.570 --> 40:27.073
Really?

40:27.173 --> 40:29.540
Just don't do it if you
don't want to do it.

40:31.910 --> 40:34.044
It's your life, right?

40:35.580 --> 40:37.214
It's nobody else's.

40:42.154 --> 40:47.727
Tumble, tumble into my arms

40:47.827 --> 40:51.664
Fumble, fumble, can't keep the grip

40:51.764 --> 40:55.232
Hello, miss. What can I
get you for your supper?

40:57.035 --> 41:00.673
Hello. My... My name is Leonardo.

41:00.773 --> 41:04.475
- Let me enter the castle, please.
- You are not Leonardo.

41:05.777 --> 41:09.081
I'm just a sad princess,
and I need to come in.

41:09.181 --> 41:10.883
- Please, oh.
- You're not a princess.

41:10.983 --> 41:13.753
- You're Auntie Amy.
- Ooh.

41:13.853 --> 41:17.590
It's a very specific kind
of rose in your cheeks.

41:17.690 --> 41:18.958
Maybe it's the antidepressants.

41:19.058 --> 41:21.627
What?

41:21.727 --> 41:24.964
Mom told me. I think it's great for you.

41:25.064 --> 41:27.867
It's not for me, personally, taking a
pill every time I have a problem.

41:27.967 --> 41:29.735
All right. No, it's not that.

41:29.835 --> 41:34.006
You just look... I don't know...
sexy, is all.

41:34.106 --> 41:36.942
Are you seeing someone?

41:38.440 --> 41:39.977
What?

41:40.277 --> 41:41.714
No.

41:41.814 --> 41:46.485
- How could I be seeing someone?
- Mom said she thought you might be.

41:46.985 --> 41:47.787
Well...

41:47.887 --> 41:50.654
She said she's been hearing the
gate sensors go off at night.

41:54.660 --> 41:57.530
Well, if you're not, you should be.

41:57.630 --> 41:59.765
We know this guy who's friends
with Craig Mankewitz.

41:59.865 --> 42:01.834
- Oh.
- Not Craig Mankewitz.

42:01.934 --> 42:03.702
His name is Phil Bauer.

42:03.802 --> 42:06.939
- He's in my rotisserie baseball league.
- He's divorced. He has one kid.

42:07.039 --> 42:09.809
He's an investment banker in
New York, but he lives here now.

42:09.909 --> 42:12.111
Your family would go crazy over him.

42:12.211 --> 42:14.811
- I already told your mom.
- Oh.

42:32.564 --> 42:34.200
You got the shovel, the ax and the pick?

42:34.300 --> 42:36.802
Where's the pick?

42:36.902 --> 42:39.939
No. That's a-no pick. That's a hog.

42:40.039 --> 42:42.808
A hog. Don't you know what a hog is?

42:42.908 --> 42:47.146
Oh, come on, let's get going. We gotta
kidnap a couple of football players.

42:47.246 --> 42:48.948
Hey.

42:49.048 --> 42:51.717
I feel pretty stupid trying
to write a novel.

42:51.817 --> 42:53.752
Because my dad's a writer.

42:53.852 --> 42:57.690
And... it just feels like...

42:57.790 --> 43:00.090
I'm trying to be like him or something.

43:05.263 --> 43:07.097
Now, what about you?

43:10.768 --> 43:13.303
I mean, like, what do
you really wanna do?

43:16.007 --> 43:18.811
Now the raging

43:18.911 --> 43:23.949
Of the forest fires end

43:24.049 --> 43:27.186
And all the mammals fled

43:27.286 --> 43:31.824
I smell in the charred darkness

43:31.924 --> 43:35.225
A little green, a little red

43:38.763 --> 43:42.535
When you sing your song

43:42.635 --> 43:45.636
Your voice washed over the sea

43:50.315 --> 43:53.513
Glacial runoff

43:53.913 --> 43:57.583
Beautiful blue light came o'er me

43:58.247 --> 44:01.218
Came o'er me

44:02.186 --> 44:05.057
Drink deep, my love

44:05.157 --> 44:08.193
For the water is gasping

44:08.293 --> 44:09.995
For your mouth

44:10.095 --> 44:13.899
Gasping for your mouth

44:13.999 --> 44:17.002
Drink deep, my love

44:17.102 --> 44:19.705
For the water is gasping

44:19.805 --> 44:22.839
For your mouth

44:47.965 --> 44:50.803
I remember in the burning

44:54.372 --> 44:57.042
A flame universe

44:57.142 --> 44:59.912
- Of bright gold and white
- Stop it.

45:00.312 --> 45:03.015
- Stop it.
- I treasured the whole fast

45:03.115 --> 45:05.048
But it was too hot to touch

45:08.219 --> 45:09.853
Why don't we go away together?

45:14.158 --> 45:16.126
Okay.

45:17.962 --> 45:20.332
No, I'm serious.

45:20.432 --> 45:22.265
I mean, I still have money
from the show.

45:24.736 --> 45:26.336
You can take pictures.

45:27.905 --> 45:29.406
I can write.

45:43.921 --> 45:45.255
Okay.

45:47.091 --> 45:49.061
- Okay. We'll go away. Where do you wanna go?
- Yeah?

45:49.161 --> 45:50.961
Where should we go?

45:53.464 --> 45:55.134
Paris?

45:55.234 --> 45:56.969
Is that cliché?

45:57.069 --> 45:59.838
It's Paris.

46:02.874 --> 46:05.342
Okay. How about somewhere un-cliché?

46:06.844 --> 46:08.479
Poland.

46:10.314 --> 46:11.982
Poland.

46:13.885 --> 46:15.921
No?

46:16.021 --> 46:18.090
L... Liechtenstein.

46:21.225 --> 46:24.129
- Canada. How about Canada?
- Oh.

46:24.229 --> 46:26.129
Exotic Canada.

46:26.864 --> 46:29.401
Saskatchewan?

46:31.904 --> 46:34.237
The wilds of Manitoba.

46:35.907 --> 46:37.710
We'll be Canadian.

46:37.810 --> 46:40.210
Are you ready for me?

46:41.312 --> 46:43.048
O...

46:43.148 --> 46:44.850
Okay. No, I got it.

46:44.950 --> 46:47.517
O Canada

46:53.191 --> 46:54.391
Hi!

46:56.929 --> 46:58.895
there was an understudy...

47:00.298 --> 47:04.369
for Patti LuPone,
so we decided not to stay.

47:04.469 --> 47:07.037
- Oh.
- We wanted to see Patti.

47:09.907 --> 47:11.877
Okay.

47:11.977 --> 47:15.414
Thank you. I'm... You...
I'm gonna let you guys go.

47:15.514 --> 47:18.582
I mean, myself go... I will be going.

47:21.219 --> 47:26.358
Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck!
Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck.

47:26.458 --> 47:28.060
Fuck, fuck.

47:28.160 --> 47:29.326
Fuck!

47:32.697 --> 47:34.665
Good evening.

47:35.900 --> 47:37.534
Oh, you scared me.

47:40.938 --> 47:42.272
Where were you tonight?

47:46.043 --> 47:48.211
- I...
- It's none of my business.

48:01.926 --> 48:03.228
Hey.

48:03.328 --> 48:05.996
Gee, I feel like I haven't
seen you in weeks.

48:10.568 --> 48:13.970
Mom says you're taking antidepressants.

48:18.242 --> 48:22.414
God, it's tough to be a parent.

48:22.514 --> 48:26.349
You just want so much for your kids,
and you just can't...

48:32.990 --> 48:38.330
If we get these cases,
it can really happen.

48:38.430 --> 48:42.933
We can stay in this house, finish the
renovations, get your mom a new car.

48:44.368 --> 48:46.002
And I could...

48:47.505 --> 48:49.007
retire.

48:49.107 --> 48:52.144
Take this trip with your mother.

48:52.244 --> 48:56.413
It would mean so much to both of us.

48:58.582 --> 49:01.017
But the one thing, you know,

49:02.687 --> 49:07.492
a father wants to feel that his kids
are all set when he retires,

49:07.592 --> 49:09.294
you know?

49:09.394 --> 49:11.930
Secure, married.

49:12.885 --> 49:14.837
With a house.

49:16.400 --> 49:18.468
A family of your own.

49:25.042 --> 49:26.309
Yeah.

49:28.212 --> 49:30.747
Yeah. No, I'm sorry. I know it's late.

49:34.685 --> 49:36.720
It's going okay.

49:38.289 --> 49:40.390
Oh, I do? That's good.

49:43.427 --> 49:48.565
I don't... I don't know
why I called exactly. I...

49:51.002 --> 49:52.671
Yeah, I know.

49:52.771 --> 49:55.572
Yeah, I know I have to
sign the papers, David.

50:00.779 --> 50:03.415
They're good.

50:03.515 --> 50:05.548
I'm sorry.

50:07.518 --> 50:11.522
No, I'm sorry. They miss you too. Yeah.

50:13.058 --> 50:14.491
Yes.

50:19.797 --> 50:23.669
No. Do you really want me to say that?

50:23.769 --> 50:26.071
Okay. I mean, no.

50:26.171 --> 50:29.406
No, they don't hate you.
No, the opposite. It's...

50:31.742 --> 50:33.410
Okay.

50:58.235 --> 50:59.669
Hey.

51:02.506 --> 51:04.674
- What?
- Come here.

51:08.512 --> 51:10.649
What?

51:10.749 --> 51:12.384
You shouldn't have come here, okay?

51:12.484 --> 51:14.052
- I'm so... We...
- Somebody could fucking see you!

51:14.152 --> 51:16.021
You just ran off.
What do you want me to do?

51:16.121 --> 51:19.658
- What did you say to her?
- Nothing. I just... I just left.

51:19.758 --> 51:22.561
I just got my bike and I
just went riding around.

51:22.661 --> 51:25.197
Well, you need to go home
and tell her something.

51:25.297 --> 51:26.563
What would you want me to say?

51:28.165 --> 51:30.402
Jeremy, I don't fucking care
what you say.

51:30.502 --> 51:33.705
Tell her some guy broke up with you and I
came over to help you pick up the pieces.

51:33.805 --> 51:36.708
Yeah, and what? And then you
just took your clothes off?

51:36.808 --> 51:38.610
Jeremy!

51:38.710 --> 51:40.645
Tell her anything, okay?

51:40.745 --> 51:43.648
Tell... Tell her I'm doing some
fucking howling at the moon,

51:43.748 --> 51:46.318
primal-scream divorce therapy!

51:46.418 --> 51:49.054
But you were singing "O Canada," Amy.

51:49.154 --> 51:52.157
- Oh!
- Amy, I don't... Why...

51:52.257 --> 51:54.491
Why can't I just tell her the truth?

51:56.760 --> 52:00.699
If she says something to your stepdad,
it could ruin my dad's retirement, okay?

52:00.799 --> 52:02.734
I could fucking ruin everything for him.

52:02.834 --> 52:08.206
Oh, God! It's like... It's like you're more
of a coward than I am, you know?

52:08.306 --> 52:10.773
And you're supposed to be
the adult in this relationship.

52:14.678 --> 52:17.514
We're not in a relationship.

52:22.387 --> 52:26.491
This whole thing,
it just got out of hand, okay?

52:26.591 --> 52:28.493
I didn't mean for it to.

52:28.593 --> 52:31.396
It just... It just happened,
and we both just went crazy.

52:31.496 --> 52:33.730
I'm... I'm sorry.

52:36.267 --> 52:39.502
You just... You just do whatever
they want you to do.

52:40.404 --> 52:42.605
And it is so pathetic.

52:44.642 --> 52:50.082
You... You don't even know what
the fuck you're talking about.

52:50.182 --> 52:53.552
I mean, it's like you think
you're so mature...

52:53.652 --> 52:58.090
and so savvy,
and you... you're just not,

52:58.190 --> 53:00.392
because you don't know a fucking
thing about the real world.

53:00.492 --> 53:04.594
There is no difference
between me and you, Amy.

53:06.864 --> 53:11.169
Yeah, there is, Jeremy.
Because you're fucking 19 years old.

53:11.269 --> 53:16.541
Okay? I was married to a man,
and I was in love with him.

53:16.641 --> 53:19.876
I had a fucking life,
and I was happy in it.

53:21.779 --> 53:24.583
Do I have to spell this out for you?

53:24.683 --> 53:27.486
You and I can't be
in a relationship, okay?

53:27.586 --> 53:28.720
- Okay.
- Okay?

53:28.820 --> 53:31.323
- Okay!
- It's ridiculous.

53:31.423 --> 53:33.758
I mean, what the fuck do you think?

53:33.858 --> 53:37.362
Do you think we're gonna go off
somewhere and wear fucking sarongs?

53:37.462 --> 53:39.798
- All right.
- And visit with holy men and smoke opium.

53:39.898 --> 53:41.800
Oh, forget it. Okay.

53:41.900 --> 53:43.866
I don't even know what you
think is gonna happen.

54:10.728 --> 54:13.331
Amy, won't you at least
go out with him once?

54:13.431 --> 54:16.766
He lives in Westport.
He has a big house here.

54:20.671 --> 54:23.873
Now you know,
if Daddy doesn't get this client,

54:25.009 --> 54:27.043
we'll all be out on the street.

54:48.932 --> 54:52.368
I think I will have the ahi tuna steak.

54:53.671 --> 54:55.004
No, I had tuna for lunch.

54:56.740 --> 54:59.411
Shoot.

54:59.511 --> 55:04.013
Can't have tuna for every meal,
or I'll turn into a thermometer.

55:05.816 --> 55:07.485
What?

55:07.585 --> 55:10.355
It's a joke. It's stupid.

55:10.455 --> 55:12.557
- I was just... 'Cause all the mercury in...
- Oh.

55:12.657 --> 55:14.226
...the oceans, in the fish.

55:14.326 --> 55:17.495
Of course. Yeah. No, I know.

55:17.595 --> 55:19.898
Isn't it a shame? Yeah.

55:19.998 --> 55:22.767
You know, I look at my...
my daughter Sarah, she's eight,

55:22.867 --> 55:27.472
and I, think what are we doing
to our oceans, you know?

55:27.572 --> 55:32.544
When fish, the most healthy thing...

55:32.644 --> 55:34.043
It's just...

55:38.549 --> 55:42.587
Because I love it.
I could have it every meal.

55:42.687 --> 55:44.556
Just, like, fish.

55:46.491 --> 55:47.890
Love it, love it, love it, love it.

55:50.427 --> 55:51.930
Salmon?

55:52.030 --> 55:53.932
Give it to me, you know?

55:54.032 --> 55:59.771
I can eat lox, gravlax, poached.
Oh, my God!

55:59.871 --> 56:01.539
I could eat poached fish all day.

56:01.639 --> 56:04.509
Yeah, I get... I get kind of
queasy from it sometimes.

56:04.609 --> 56:05.710
Really?

56:05.810 --> 56:07.579
Fish?

56:07.679 --> 56:09.078
I wonder why.

56:11.148 --> 56:12.148
Not me.

56:13.717 --> 56:17.856
And you know it's one of those,
top 10 foods...

56:17.956 --> 56:19.958
in terms of being good for you.

56:22.394 --> 56:23.428
almonds...

56:23.528 --> 56:25.528
is one of them, I think.

56:26.897 --> 56:29.499
Spinach.

56:31.468 --> 56:34.537
Yogurt, which is...

56:35.873 --> 56:40.445
kind of weird to me,
'cause I'm not a big yogurt fan.

56:40.545 --> 56:44.316
And I'm not an angry guy, you know.
I'm about enjoying life.

56:44.416 --> 56:49.054
And, you know, sometimes stuff happens.
So whose fault is that really?

56:49.154 --> 56:51.589
It's... It's two people, you know?

56:51.689 --> 56:54.759
It takes two people
to tango, so to speak.

56:54.859 --> 56:59.864
So I just think it's really unfair to...
to put all the blame on one person.

56:59.964 --> 57:03.968
The good news is Sarah is
totally fine with it, so...

57:04.068 --> 57:05.570
- That's great.
- At least there's that, yeah.

57:07.772 --> 57:10.575
- You are just so cute, and this outfit is adorable.
- Okay.

57:10.675 --> 57:13.643
- It's my mother's. I borrowed it from my mother.
- Oh, that's... that's okay.

57:14.878 --> 57:17.048
- Sorry.
- Okay. I get it.

57:17.348 --> 57:20.452
I'm sorry. Totally. I get it.

57:20.552 --> 57:25.357
Right after my divorce, I couldn't even
imagine dating anybody else, no way, no how.

57:25.457 --> 57:28.157
- So...
- Okay.

57:28.926 --> 57:30.726
Can I see you again?

57:32.963 --> 57:35.367
The fox went out on a chilly night

57:35.467 --> 57:37.969
And he prayed for the moon
to give him light

57:38.069 --> 57:40.872
He had many a mile to go that night

57:40.972 --> 57:43.575
Before he reached the town-o

57:43.675 --> 57:46.411
Town-o, town-o

57:46.511 --> 57:48.813
Many a mile to go that night

57:48.913 --> 57:51.516
Before he reached the town-o

58:11.603 --> 58:13.738
Here I am, this therapist,

58:13.838 --> 58:16.741
and I don't know what's
going on with my own child.

58:16.841 --> 58:20.612
- It's so embarrassing.
- It's so humiliating. Gwen...

58:20.712 --> 58:24.149
He says that you listen to him.
You see him.

58:24.249 --> 58:26.584
He says that I'm in denial.

58:26.684 --> 58:29.421
That I'm trying to make him into
something that I want him to be.

58:29.521 --> 58:31.990
That I don't see him. You know what?

58:32.090 --> 58:34.426
That's not even the point, I guess.

58:34.526 --> 58:38.630
The point is he finally
told me the truth.

58:38.730 --> 58:43.699
Even though it's upsetting that I
didn't even know, the point is...

58:46.270 --> 58:49.140
He doesn't like acting.

58:49.240 --> 58:53.878
I mean, I deal with
this stuff every day.

58:53.978 --> 58:58.214
And here I am not realizing the effect
that I'm having on my own child.

59:00.217 --> 59:04.222
"The greatest tragedy of the family
is the unlived lives of the parents."

59:04.322 --> 59:05.990
Jung said that.

59:06.090 --> 59:10.595
I say that to my patients
almost every day.

59:10.695 --> 59:13.965
Hey, how is your therapy going?

59:14.065 --> 59:17.535
The, singing, naked, swimming thing?

59:17.635 --> 59:20.102
- Yeah, it's good.
- Good.

59:22.306 --> 59:24.073
I'm so sorry about that.

59:25.242 --> 59:28.480
Oh, no. You know, whatever works.

59:28.580 --> 59:31.216
Geez, I wish that I had had
something like that...

59:31.316 --> 59:36.852
so visceral and active...
when I was going through my divorce.

59:39.089 --> 59:40.790
Thank you for listening.

59:42.726 --> 59:45.361
Come here. Give me a hug, will ya?

59:47.297 --> 59:49.632
- Thank you.
- Gwen.

59:56.807 --> 59:58.910
Sorry about throwing the rock at you.

59:59.010 --> 01:00:02.547
Yeah.

01:00:02.647 --> 01:00:07.685
Please don't tell Jeremy that I
was snooping in his room.

01:00:07.785 --> 01:00:12.090
It's just he's been seeing some boy all
summer and they just broke up and...

01:00:12.190 --> 01:00:14.526
I don't know, I was just looking...

01:00:14.626 --> 01:00:18.263
to find something, I don't know.

01:00:18.363 --> 01:00:20.296
Sure.

01:00:21.965 --> 01:00:25.703
Intimacy is such a rare thing.

01:00:25.803 --> 01:00:29.372
And I want it for Jeremy so badly.

01:00:30.707 --> 01:00:34.913
Even if it is with some big hairy guy.

01:00:39.249 --> 01:00:42.020
Where is Jeremy?

01:01:03.741 --> 01:01:07.579
Hey, Honky! Honky!

01:01:07.679 --> 01:01:10.348
- Get in here, you fucking idiot dog.
- Hi.

01:01:10.448 --> 01:01:12.216
- Oh.
- Sorry.

01:01:12.316 --> 01:01:15.753
- Hey.
- I'm just, looking...

01:01:15.853 --> 01:01:17.219
Somebody's mom's here!

01:01:19.356 --> 01:01:21.359
Yo! Somebody's mom's here!

01:01:21.459 --> 01:01:23.328
No, sorry. It's the wrong house.

01:01:23.428 --> 01:01:24.796
Wrong...

01:01:25.687 --> 01:01:27.833
Off!

01:01:29.499 --> 01:01:31.167
Geez.

01:01:47.863 --> 01:01:49.396
Hello?

01:02:00.463 --> 01:02:03.835
Oh, shit. Oh, shit.

01:02:03.935 --> 01:02:06.215
Oh, I need to get out of here.

01:02:44.341 --> 01:02:47.243
Where the fuck is bottom?

01:02:49.412 --> 01:02:54.952
Where the motherfucking fuck
is motherfucking bottom?

01:03:05.062 --> 01:03:08.199
- Whoo!
- Amy Minkie's in the house!

01:03:08.299 --> 01:03:09.834
- Whoo!
- Minsky!

01:03:09.934 --> 01:03:12.436
- You go, girl!
- Whoo, yee-haw!

01:03:13.538 --> 01:03:16.708
- Oh, I just got a brain freeze from that ice.
- You go, girl!

01:03:16.808 --> 01:03:18.843
You need another, girl.
I'll get you another.

01:03:18.943 --> 01:03:20.878
Whoo. I haven't done this
since high school.

01:03:20.978 --> 01:03:22.346
Whoa!

01:03:22.446 --> 01:03:24.213
Hey, what have you been
doing since high school?

01:03:25.515 --> 01:03:28.986
- Yeah.
- You know...

01:03:29.086 --> 01:03:32.290
She was totally married and had
everything. My mom told me.

01:03:32.390 --> 01:03:35.891
Cute husband, big apartment.
Then he totally dumped her.

01:03:38.261 --> 01:03:43.201
- Yeah.
- But that was... pssk! You know?

01:03:43.301 --> 01:03:47.071
'Cause now I'm back here. It's whoo!

01:03:47.171 --> 01:03:49.073
So fun, you guys.

01:03:49.173 --> 01:03:51.509
- Here, girl.
- No, I can't.

01:03:51.609 --> 01:03:53.411
- Oh, you can do that!
- Yeah.

01:03:53.511 --> 01:03:55.379
Yep.

01:03:56.179 --> 01:03:58.816
I don't think I can. You can have it.

01:03:58.916 --> 01:04:03.821
No, you are here to "par-tay,"
you divorcée!

01:04:05.923 --> 01:04:09.794
Go, go, go, go, go, go,
go, go, go, go, go, go!

01:04:09.894 --> 01:04:12.194
Minkie, Minkie, Minkie, Minkie!

01:04:16.867 --> 01:04:19.036
Sorry, Infinity.

01:04:29.546 --> 01:04:31.113
Are you okay?

01:04:56.974 --> 01:04:58.908
Hey, what's wrong?

01:05:02.012 --> 01:05:04.234
Oh, Karen...

01:05:05.483 --> 01:05:07.919
I fuck everything up.

01:05:08.019 --> 01:05:10.488
Oh, hey, come on.

01:05:10.588 --> 01:05:13.622
I... I screw everything up.

01:05:15.191 --> 01:05:18.563
Everything in my life, Karen.
Every fucking thing.

01:05:19.997 --> 01:05:22.066
It's, like, amazing.

01:05:22.166 --> 01:05:25.336
I fail everyone in my fucking life.

01:05:25.436 --> 01:05:27.071
Everyone who loves me.

01:05:27.171 --> 01:05:30.272
If somebody loves me, then I fuck it up.

01:05:34.478 --> 01:05:36.478
What are you talking about?

01:05:40.350 --> 01:05:42.887
Love isn't like a prize
you get at the circus...

01:05:42.987 --> 01:05:45.554
for squirting water in the
clown's face the longest.

01:05:47.624 --> 01:05:50.659
If somebody loves you,
they just love you, you know?

01:06:04.034 --> 01:06:06.110
What the fuck?

01:06:06.610 --> 01:06:10.181
Oh, no. Oh, no!

01:06:10.281 --> 01:06:12.650
My lips!

01:06:12.750 --> 01:06:16.954
Oh, my God! They cost a fortune!

01:06:17.054 --> 01:06:21.025
Look. Look what you've done!

01:06:21.125 --> 01:06:24.028
They... They were...
They were right in the front hallway.

01:06:24.128 --> 01:06:28.197
I left a note on the door.
Are you drunk?

01:06:29.399 --> 01:06:32.570
You are! Oh, God! Look what you've done.

01:06:32.670 --> 01:06:37.008
I can't believe that you've done this.
You are so incredibly selfish.

01:06:37.108 --> 01:06:40.611
- Just... I'm gonna clean it up, just...
- No! Just leave it.

01:06:40.711 --> 01:06:45.950
Don't you... Don't you touch anything.
Don't you ruin anything more.

01:06:46.050 --> 01:06:49.120
- Oh, my God!
- My God. Mom, I'm sorry.

01:06:49.220 --> 01:06:51.255
But they were completely
corralled in darkness.

01:06:51.355 --> 01:06:54.392
- You take no responsibility for anything.
- What?

01:06:54.492 --> 01:06:56.560
That is not true.

01:06:56.660 --> 01:06:58.930
Oh, yeah. Your father
and I have taken you in.

01:06:59.030 --> 01:07:01.933
We let you sleep late.
We let you loll around in that T-shirt.

01:07:02.033 --> 01:07:04.335
And you've just...
you've just given up...

01:07:04.435 --> 01:07:07.171
the way that you've given up on
everything you've ever started.

01:07:07.271 --> 01:07:09.206
What have I ever given up on?

01:07:09.306 --> 01:07:12.176
Oh. Well, let me...
let me count the ways.

01:07:12.276 --> 01:07:14.712
Let's see, you...
Oh, tennis camp when you were 10.

01:07:14.812 --> 01:07:18.683
- I was the only one with boobs!
- You could get a bra that fit!

01:07:18.783 --> 01:07:20.618
You didn't have to jump ship!

01:07:20.718 --> 01:07:23.988
Oh, my God. I could give you a list
that would fill a roll of toilet paper.

01:07:24.088 --> 01:07:26.090
All of those internships...

01:07:26.190 --> 01:07:29.527
and the projects on the living
room floor that I had to clean up!

01:07:29.627 --> 01:07:32.697
And your... And your master's degree
Daddy said that you would never finish.

01:07:32.797 --> 01:07:35.166
But he was so happy when
you were gonna marry David.

01:07:35.266 --> 01:07:38.135
He said, "Oh, Ruth, yes!
She's getting married.

01:07:38.235 --> 01:07:40.004
She'll have someone
to take care of her."

01:07:40.104 --> 01:07:43.505
I thought you were finally gonna
wake up and see what you had.

01:07:44.574 --> 01:07:48.646
David left me, Mom! Okay? Remember?

01:07:48.746 --> 01:07:52.216
I didn't quit my marriage. He left me.

01:07:52.316 --> 01:07:55.484
And why... do you think?

01:08:00.423 --> 01:08:02.193
What?

01:08:02.293 --> 01:08:05.062
You think because I did something wrong,
so he stopped loving me?

01:08:05.162 --> 01:08:06.497
Is that what you think?

01:08:06.597 --> 01:08:08.464
That I failed?

01:08:10.233 --> 01:08:13.404
Well, that's not what love is, Mom.

01:08:13.504 --> 01:08:17.639
It's not a prize that you get for coming
in the clown's face at the circus.

01:08:19.475 --> 01:08:20.576
What?

01:08:22.612 --> 01:08:26.017
Listen. If... If you behaved in your
marriage the way that you behave here,

01:08:26.117 --> 01:08:27.551
of course it fell apart.

01:08:27.651 --> 01:08:30.187
Hey, I've been watching you
for three months...

01:08:30.287 --> 01:08:33.090
do nothing to help yourself,
do nothing at all.

01:08:33.189 --> 01:08:37.259
I have not been doing nothing
for the past three months.

01:08:38.627 --> 01:08:41.131
How would you even know
what I've been doing?

01:08:41.232 --> 01:08:45.036
You're so much more interested in those
Wanguni lips than you have ever been in me!

01:08:45.136 --> 01:08:49.040
Do you think anyone in this house
has ever shown any interest in me?

01:08:49.140 --> 01:08:52.309
Oh, my God, Amy. Do you...
What do you think life is?

01:08:52.408 --> 01:08:55.078
Just one... one ribbon
cutting after another?

01:08:55.179 --> 01:08:59.750
I keep this house together.
I keep this marriage together.

01:08:59.850 --> 01:09:02.720
And I don't get any accolades or praise.

01:09:02.819 --> 01:09:04.685
I'm like the family dog.

01:09:06.788 --> 01:09:10.461
And all I would like... one little thing
I would like after all these years...

01:09:10.560 --> 01:09:13.564
is to spend some time with your father.

01:09:13.663 --> 01:09:17.399
And you just keep finding ways to
make everything harder for me!

01:09:23.805 --> 01:09:25.908
Don't forget to turn out the lights.

01:09:32.348 --> 01:09:35.386
Well, I'm certainly grateful for this
magnificent washout... turnout.

01:09:35.486 --> 01:09:38.354
And, now I'd like to say a few words.

01:09:38.455 --> 01:09:41.425
Hello, I must be going

01:09:41.524 --> 01:09:44.562
I cannot stay I came to say
I must be going

01:09:44.662 --> 01:09:47.363
I'm glad I came
But just the same I must be going

01:09:47.464 --> 01:09:48.566
La, la

01:09:48.666 --> 01:09:51.202
For my sake you must stay

01:09:51.301 --> 01:09:55.272
If you should go away,
you'd spoil this party I am throwing

01:09:55.372 --> 01:09:57.575
I'll stay a week or two

01:09:57.675 --> 01:10:00.177
I'll stay the summer through

01:10:00.277 --> 01:10:02.746
But I am telling you

01:10:02.846 --> 01:10:07.218
I must be going

01:10:16.626 --> 01:10:19.828
Don't worry about your mom.
She'll settle down.

01:10:25.268 --> 01:10:27.302
You can stay here as long as you want.

01:11:15.585 --> 01:11:18.389
Yeah. Yeah. Bye.

01:11:18.489 --> 01:11:21.456
- Aims. Hey.
- Hi.

01:11:22.625 --> 01:11:24.528
- You look nice, hon.
- Thank you.

01:11:24.628 --> 01:11:27.331
I feel overdressed, like...

01:11:27.431 --> 01:11:30.632
What are you talking about?
You can't overdress in New York. Come on.

01:11:32.568 --> 01:11:35.537
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

01:11:44.981 --> 01:11:48.285
So look at this. Look at my shoe.

01:11:48.385 --> 01:11:50.387
You believe this? $700.

01:11:50.487 --> 01:11:53.524
All I did was walk from Union Square.

01:11:53.624 --> 01:11:55.759
It's terrible.

01:11:55.859 --> 01:11:58.696
What, you making fun of me?

01:11:58.796 --> 01:12:02.733
I bought these for a meeting I have
tomorrow with one of the Olsen twins.

01:12:02.833 --> 01:12:04.468
I don't even know which one.

01:12:05.068 --> 01:12:08.639
- You should find out.
- If I can.

01:12:08.739 --> 01:12:11.006
- Before tomorrow. Thank you.
- Thank you.

01:12:13.743 --> 01:12:17.379
So really, you really...
You look good. I was worried.

01:12:18.047 --> 01:12:19.617
Really?

01:12:19.717 --> 01:12:22.351
Yeah, you know, last time.

01:12:22.985 --> 01:12:25.990
Unsightly circles? What?

01:12:26.090 --> 01:12:29.091
No, no, I don't... Come on,
not like that. I... You know.

01:12:29.892 --> 01:12:31.460
No, I know.

01:12:32.829 --> 01:12:34.999
Yeah. I... I'm okay.

01:12:35.299 --> 01:12:39.101
- I'm... I mean, I'm better.
- Wait just a sec.

01:12:43.973 --> 01:12:45.476
Good.

01:12:45.576 --> 01:12:47.109
Good.

01:12:52.648 --> 01:12:54.616
Can we talk openly?

01:12:57.990 --> 01:13:00.124
I don't know.

01:13:00.424 --> 01:13:01.790
Can we order first?

01:13:04.526 --> 01:13:07.095
Just wait... Just one second.

01:13:07.930 --> 01:13:10.399
Oh, God.

01:13:11.434 --> 01:13:12.868
Okay.

01:13:20.176 --> 01:13:21.943
What happened?

01:13:23.413 --> 01:13:26.317
- What?
- Between us.

01:13:26.417 --> 01:13:30.988
Here? You-You-You want me to
talk about this... about this here?

01:13:31.088 --> 01:13:33.824
I promise I won't cry.

01:13:33.924 --> 01:13:37.959
I'm not gonna... I... I just...
I wanna know, okay?

01:13:41.130 --> 01:13:47.705
I don't know. I-I don't... I mean I just...
You know, I felt... I felt...

01:13:47.805 --> 01:13:50.541
- Amy, can we...
- Come on.

01:13:50.641 --> 01:13:53.975
Please? I... I promise.

01:13:55.845 --> 01:13:59.047
We'd been together for so long,
you know. I-I-I...

01:14:03.586 --> 01:14:05.856
All right, you wanna...
you wanna know why?

01:14:05.956 --> 01:14:10.661
I... I knew everything
that was gonna happen to us.

01:14:10.761 --> 01:14:13.063
I mean, I knew everything that was
gonna happen to me, more importantly,

01:14:13.163 --> 01:14:14.865
because I was... I was with you,

01:14:14.965 --> 01:14:17.368
and I just... I didn't...
I didn't wanna know that.

01:14:17.468 --> 01:14:21.536
I didn't wanna... I didn't wanna
see the end of my life like that.

01:14:25.007 --> 01:14:27.044
I loved you.

01:14:27.144 --> 01:14:32.950
You know. I mean, I... We were...
We were compatible.

01:14:33.050 --> 01:14:37.719
We were great friends, right? And that was...
that was great. That was great.

01:14:39.722 --> 01:14:41.223
But...

01:14:49.932 --> 01:14:52.801
So are you jumping out of planes now?

01:14:55.261 --> 01:14:57.064
No.

01:14:57.773 --> 01:15:00.043
No. Hey, can we order now?

01:15:00.143 --> 01:15:02.646
Are you still seeing Kimberly?

01:15:02.746 --> 01:15:05.716
No. No, that... No.

01:15:05.816 --> 01:15:08.183
That whole thing... That was... I mean,
really, that was... that was crazy.

01:15:10.953 --> 01:15:13.054
You know, I thought I wanted to,

01:15:15.525 --> 01:15:17.561
be with someone successful, you know,

01:15:17.661 --> 01:15:19.661
like someone in my field.

01:15:21.230 --> 01:15:23.133
Aims, all she did was talk
about her fucking cases.

01:15:23.233 --> 01:15:26.637
It was like I couldn't
get away from work.

01:15:26.737 --> 01:15:30.238
It was, like, no escape, no island.

01:15:33.876 --> 01:15:35.944
I started seeing someone
for a while too.

01:15:37.613 --> 01:15:38.615
Really?

01:15:38.715 --> 01:15:40.248
Yeah.

01:15:43.119 --> 01:15:44.825
I...

01:15:47.057 --> 01:15:50.625
Sorry. What can you do? I mean, it's...

01:16:07.610 --> 01:16:09.012
What?

01:16:09.112 --> 01:16:12.783
I... It's okay. I'm not sad.

01:16:12.883 --> 01:16:15.752
- It's not... I'm not sad.
- What are you doing?

01:16:15.852 --> 01:16:18.555
I just don't feel like seeing you.

01:16:18.655 --> 01:16:20.491
You... Why?

01:16:20.591 --> 01:16:22.659
Amy?

01:16:22.759 --> 01:16:27.998
Because I feel bad about myself
when I'm with you.

01:16:28.098 --> 01:16:32.503
I feel really bad, and I always have.

01:16:32.603 --> 01:16:36.304
But I didn't know it. I...
I was just so used to it.

01:16:37.039 --> 01:16:39.841
And I think...

01:16:41.043 --> 01:16:45.680
I just thought that
that was being alive.

01:16:47.984 --> 01:16:52.055
To always feel bad and wrong and...

01:16:52.155 --> 01:16:56.358
just insecure and invisible.

01:16:58.060 --> 01:16:59.897
So thank you.

01:16:59.997 --> 01:17:02.297
Thank you for ending our marriage.

01:17:04.734 --> 01:17:06.003
- David.
- Yeah?

01:17:06.103 --> 01:17:09.206
I really mean it.

01:17:09.306 --> 01:17:11.808
Thank you.
Because I wasn't happy with you.

01:17:11.908 --> 01:17:13.842
And I would never have ended it myself.

01:17:14.910 --> 01:17:17.180
Truly. I...

01:17:17.280 --> 01:17:19.883
And you know what?

01:17:19.983 --> 01:17:22.753
I wanna change the papers.

01:17:22.853 --> 01:17:24.855
I'm not a fucking idiot.

01:17:24.955 --> 01:17:27.558
I invested a lot of time into you,

01:17:27.658 --> 01:17:32.127
and I just think I should be reimbursed.

01:17:34.330 --> 01:17:35.730
Okay.

01:17:50.913 --> 01:17:53.183
Amy, we're having a party!

01:17:53.283 --> 01:17:55.886
- Oh!
- They picked daddy.

01:17:55.986 --> 01:17:57.721
- Amazing?
- Oh.

01:17:57.821 --> 01:18:02.326
- I bought the tickets for the trip.
- Come, have a glass of champagne.

01:18:02.426 --> 01:18:05.329
- Isn't it just great?
- Yeah, it's really great.

01:18:05.429 --> 01:18:07.230
It all worked out. You see, Ruth?

01:18:07.330 --> 01:18:09.798
- And you were right.
- Your mother was worried.

01:18:11.767 --> 01:18:13.168
To "Gallivanting the Globe."

01:18:14.236 --> 01:18:17.839
To Mom and Dad, for taking me in.

01:18:19.809 --> 01:18:21.309
Thanks.

01:18:31.755 --> 01:18:33.357
Come on, think fast

01:18:38.161 --> 01:18:41.365
- Noah.
- Come here.

01:18:41.465 --> 01:18:44.901
- Dad's retiring.
- Congratulations to everyone.

01:18:45.001 --> 01:18:48.772
I'm gonna be my own boss.
Finally fuckin' free.

01:18:48.872 --> 01:18:51.174
I'm so happy for you.

01:18:51.274 --> 01:18:54.311
Hey. Oh, my God.
We talked to Phil Bauer.

01:18:54.411 --> 01:18:56.880
I think he's in love with you.

01:18:56.980 --> 01:18:59.349
He said that you were the
greatest listener he's ever met.

01:19:01.818 --> 01:19:04.821
Hi, Gwen!

01:19:04.921 --> 01:19:07.222
Are you okay?

01:19:11.494 --> 01:19:14.829
Can you... I have to go.

01:19:16.031 --> 01:19:18.869
See? See? That's why
I never eat shellfish.

01:19:18.969 --> 01:19:22.272
To keep your love around

01:19:22.372 --> 01:19:25.208
I need you every day

01:19:27.144 --> 01:19:28.412
Jeremy.

01:19:30.814 --> 01:19:33.114
- Jeremy.
- Shit.

01:19:37.920 --> 01:19:40.724
I didn't know that you
were gonna be here, okay?

01:19:40.824 --> 01:19:42.824
I would... I wouldn't have come.

01:19:44.426 --> 01:19:47.197
I was hoping that you would be here.

01:19:47.297 --> 01:19:51.334
What are you talk... I thought...
I thought that you didn't wanna see me.

01:19:51.434 --> 01:19:52.967
Look, okay.

01:19:54.370 --> 01:19:55.939
This whole thing is just...

01:19:56.039 --> 01:20:00.977
It's embarrassing for me, okay?

01:20:01.077 --> 01:20:03.378
And I'd just rather
not even talk about it.

01:20:06.215 --> 01:20:09.083
You taught me how to be loved.

01:20:16.859 --> 01:20:21.231
I don't think that I even knew
what that meant to be loved...

01:20:21.331 --> 01:20:22.897
before I met you.

01:20:25.467 --> 01:20:27.101
And you're...

01:20:29.104 --> 01:20:32.209
you're not a kid, Jeremy, like I said.

01:20:32.309 --> 01:20:34.375
You're not like some boy.

01:20:38.247 --> 01:20:42.383
I just had never been with a man before.

01:20:43.619 --> 01:20:46.054
And I didn't know what that was like.

01:20:50.627 --> 01:20:52.393
Fuck.

01:20:54.463 --> 01:20:57.165
That was a good thing to say.

01:21:00.069 --> 01:21:02.539
I don't want anything from you.

01:21:02.639 --> 01:21:05.776
I don't. And I know that
we cannot be together.

01:21:05.876 --> 01:21:07.544
I know that, but...

01:21:07.644 --> 01:21:11.515
My God, when I'm 35, you...

01:21:11.615 --> 01:21:13.183
- Yeah. Yeah.
- You're gonna be...

01:21:13.283 --> 01:21:16.217
- Right. I got it.
- But I have to say...

01:21:19.021 --> 01:21:21.656
I just fucking love you.

01:21:23.893 --> 01:21:25.262
I just fucking love you.

01:21:25.362 --> 01:21:27.328
Okay.

01:21:35.571 --> 01:21:37.174
What are you doing?

01:21:37.274 --> 01:21:40.074
- I have to...
- Oh, no, you're crazy.

01:21:59.228 --> 01:22:01.096
Shit.

01:23:03.392 --> 01:23:07.364
Hey, so I'm gonna be in the sublet for,
like, two months until I find a place.

01:23:07.464 --> 01:23:09.764
Okay.

01:23:16.538 --> 01:23:20.076
At least I didn't screw
everything up for you.

01:23:20.176 --> 01:23:22.343
That's good anyway.

01:23:27.316 --> 01:23:31.352
So, retirement...
that's exciting. Finally.

01:23:34.123 --> 01:23:36.259
And the trip and...

01:23:36.359 --> 01:23:37.527
Oh, Dad.

01:23:40.729 --> 01:23:43.197
Are we ever gonna talk about this?

01:23:44.466 --> 01:23:46.067
What is there to talk about?

01:23:58.180 --> 01:23:59.547
I gotta go.

01:24:09.491 --> 01:24:11.059
Okay.

01:24:14.163 --> 01:24:16.230
What can you do?

01:24:20.235 --> 01:24:21.803
Mom?

01:24:25.140 --> 01:24:26.774
Mom?

01:24:34.216 --> 01:24:36.453
Mom?

01:24:36.553 --> 01:24:38.219
Yeah?

01:24:43.292 --> 01:24:44.659
Hey, I'm leaving.

01:24:46.128 --> 01:24:49.397
I never liked lapis.
It's just cheap looking.

01:24:54.603 --> 01:24:57.238
I'm really sorry about everything, Mom.

01:25:04.646 --> 01:25:07.450
I'm glad that it all worked out
for you guys in the end,

01:25:07.550 --> 01:25:10.253
and I'm glad that Dad got the clients,

01:25:10.353 --> 01:25:13.123
and I didn't completely screw
everything up.

01:25:13.223 --> 01:25:16.190
Yeah. Well, it doesn't matter.

01:25:18.594 --> 01:25:21.364
What do you... What do
you mean it doesn't matter?

01:25:21.464 --> 01:25:24.701
Well, we're not going on the trip.
We're not going on the trip.

01:25:24.801 --> 01:25:26.601
- You're not?
- No.

01:25:27.836 --> 01:25:30.571
He's not retiring.

01:25:33.575 --> 01:25:34.644
What?

01:25:34.744 --> 01:25:37.178
No, he doesn't want to.

01:25:39.781 --> 01:25:42.383
He doesn't want to, Amy.

01:25:46.388 --> 01:25:47.755
- Mom.
- Nah.

01:25:48.857 --> 01:25:51.728
He never wanted to.

01:25:52.740 --> 01:25:54.750
He was never going to.

01:25:54.850 --> 01:25:57.865
So, I thought I would,
you know, sit here and just...

01:25:59.434 --> 01:26:01.502
organize this shit!

01:26:03.672 --> 01:26:07.844
There's nothing else to do.
There's nothing else to do.

01:26:07.944 --> 01:26:10.213
- Mom.
- No.

01:26:10.313 --> 01:26:13.116
- Oh, I'm so sorry.
- I don't care.

01:26:13.216 --> 01:26:15.719
Mom, come on.

01:26:16.619 --> 01:26:19.589
- Hey, Mom, I'm so sorry.
- Oh, stop.

01:26:19.689 --> 01:26:22.292
I'm so sorry. Come here.

01:26:22.392 --> 01:26:24.258
Come on, come on.

01:26:26.962 --> 01:26:29.263
Oh, Amy.

01:26:33.435 --> 01:26:36.106
I'm so sorry, Mom.

01:26:36.206 --> 01:26:37.373
- I'm sorry.
- No.

01:26:37.473 --> 01:26:41.377
I'm sorry for what I've done...

01:26:41.477 --> 01:26:43.813
to you.

01:26:43.913 --> 01:26:46.514
I'm so sorry.

01:27:25.687 --> 01:27:28.158
We will see each other again, right?

01:27:31.560 --> 01:27:33.296
You're not just gonna
disappear forever, are you?

01:27:33.396 --> 01:27:35.997
No. No.

01:27:37.466 --> 01:27:39.333
Okay.

01:27:40.802 --> 01:27:42.703
So, Oberlin?

01:27:43.739 --> 01:27:45.773
Yeah.

01:27:47.676 --> 01:27:50.246
College is gonna be
really exciting, Jeremy.

01:27:50.346 --> 01:27:53.816
- Fuck off.
- Well, I'm just trying something, right?

01:27:53.916 --> 01:27:57.287
I'm trying to be...

01:27:57.387 --> 01:28:00.354
You'll fall in love,
and I will kill myself.

01:28:01.456 --> 01:28:03.591
Yeah, that's better.

01:28:06.828 --> 01:28:08.963
I wanted to tell you...

01:28:10.866 --> 01:28:13.034
I'm gonna finish my thesis.

01:28:15.370 --> 01:28:16.406
You are?

01:28:16.506 --> 01:28:17.905
Yeah.

01:28:20.409 --> 01:28:23.711
I'm gonna go "Gallivanting the Globe"...

01:28:25.013 --> 01:28:27.684
- What?
- ...with my mom.

01:28:27.784 --> 01:28:32.653
I'm gonna go with her and take
pictures of her next to rivers.

01:28:34.856 --> 01:28:37.425
There are some amazing rivers out there.

01:28:42.798 --> 01:28:44.400
The driver just got out of the car.

01:28:44.500 --> 01:28:46.334
Well, he's...

01:28:55.544 --> 01:28:58.748
Now the raging

01:28:58.848 --> 01:29:01.751
Okay. Of the forest fires end

01:29:02.458 --> 01:29:04.254
Okay.

01:29:04.454 --> 01:29:06.176
Okay.

01:29:06.989 --> 01:29:11.561
I smell in the charred darkness

01:29:11.661 --> 01:29:15.663
A little green, a little red

01:29:18.500 --> 01:29:21.704
When you sang your song

01:29:21.804 --> 01:29:25.473
Your voice washed over the sea

01:29:29.945 --> 01:29:33.483
Glacial runoff

01:29:33.583 --> 01:29:37.620
Beautiful blue light came o'er me

01:29:37.720 --> 01:29:41.791
Came o'er me

01:29:41.891 --> 01:29:44.727
Drink deep, my love

01:29:44.827 --> 01:29:49.866
For the water is gasping for your mouth

01:29:49.966 --> 01:29:53.469
Gasping for your mouth

01:29:53.569 --> 01:29:56.606
Drink deep, my love

01:29:56.706 --> 01:30:01.709
For the water is gasping for your mouth

01:30:05.080 --> 01:30:08.084
Drink deep, my love

01:30:08.184 --> 01:30:13.056
For the water is gasping for your mouth

01:30:13.156 --> 01:30:16.793
Gasping for your mouth

01:30:16.893 --> 01:30:19.796
Drink deep, my love

01:30:19.896 --> 01:30:25.199
For the water is gasping for your mouth

01:30:28.203 --> 01:30:31.107
Drink deep, my love

01:30:31.207 --> 01:30:36.079
For the water is gasping for your mouth

01:30:36.179 --> 01:30:39.782
Gasping for your mouth

01:30:39.882 --> 01:30:42.819
Drink deep, my love

01:30:42.919 --> 01:30:48.222
For the water is gasping for your mouth

01:31:36.204 --> 01:31:40.410
I'm finally melting

01:31:40.510 --> 01:31:42.910
In the sun

01:31:45.814 --> 01:31:51.952
Springtime is helping me hear the hum

01:31:54.890 --> 01:32:00.227
Oh, the pulse I thought was
freezing's coming back

01:32:04.199 --> 01:32:09.939
Beneath the surface I can
feel they're coming bright

01:32:10.039 --> 01:32:12.740
It's coming fast

01:32:14.276 --> 01:32:20.114
Out in the clearing here with you

01:32:23.685 --> 01:32:29.990
Buds all a-bursting green and new

01:32:32.694 --> 01:32:38.866
All the planets never seen
inside the cloud

01:32:42.037 --> 01:32:47.777
Into focus now they come
They're rolling bright

01:32:47.877 --> 01:32:50.277
They're rolling fast

01:32:52.581 --> 01:32:58.652
Winter was crushing
Now the water is rushing in the stream

01:33:01.957 --> 01:33:07.230
Winter was crushing
Now the water is rushing in the stream

01:33:39.128 --> 01:33:41.962
