00:58.934 --> 01:00.519
My petal got caught
in the fence again.

01:00.519 --> 01:01.812
Do we have to lay down
like that?

01:01.812 --> 01:03.314
- Yes.
- Can we just crouch?

01:03.314 --> 01:05.065
You haven't bloomed yet.
If you crouch, you've bloomed.

01:05.065 --> 01:06.525
- There's not enough room.
- Well, it's all the room
we have,

01:06.525 --> 01:08.402
so there's plenty of room.
Back to one!

01:08.402 --> 01:09.904
Are we ever gonna get
through this?

01:09.904 --> 01:11.739
Frank. Nicky.

01:11.739 --> 01:14.992
Wow.
You got here fast.
- The message said come quick.

01:14.992 --> 01:17.828
Usually when we call people
to come quick, they dillydally.

01:17.828 --> 01:19.288
And cross state lines.

01:19.288 --> 01:20.998
We appreciate you not making us
go to Connecticut

01:20.998 --> 01:23.626
- to get you back.
- So, what's the emergency?

01:23.626 --> 01:24.960
We need a favor.

01:24.960 --> 01:27.463
Sure. What kind of favor?

01:27.463 --> 01:29.590
We got a little show opening
here at the Expo tomorrow.

01:29.590 --> 01:31.050
Just something fun, informative.

01:31.050 --> 01:32.468
Excellent production values.

01:32.468 --> 01:34.178
It is very good this year.
Mm-hmm.

01:34.178 --> 01:36.138
But our lead performer
just dropped out.

01:36.138 --> 01:38.224
- We can't find him.
- You tried Connecticut?

01:38.224 --> 01:40.226
- We have, actually.
- Oh, he'll turn up somewhere,

01:40.226 --> 01:41.644
most likely on the shore.

01:41.644 --> 01:44.772
So, we were thinking: Midge.

01:44.772 --> 01:46.982
- As what?
- As the lead character.

01:46.982 --> 01:48.442
The lead.
I thought you'd like that.

01:48.442 --> 01:49.652
What the hell
are you talking about?

01:49.652 --> 01:51.779
One of our affiliates is
selling a product here

01:51.779 --> 01:54.114
through the forum
of music and dance,

01:54.114 --> 01:56.367
and the leading part
is sort of a narrator.

01:56.367 --> 01:57.868
Like <i>Our Town</i> with an edge.

01:57.868 --> 01:58.994
Midge is a comic.

01:58.994 --> 02:00.287
This isn't really her thing.

02:00.287 --> 02:01.997
Could it be her thing?
Just for a day?

02:01.997 --> 02:03.582
I don't think so.

02:03.582 --> 02:06.085
How about now?

02:06.085 --> 02:08.087
That is a very nice number,

02:08.087 --> 02:10.089
but she's got
a full-time job now.

02:10.089 --> 02:11.549
Mm. We already mentioned her
to the boss.

02:11.549 --> 02:12.800
He loved the idea.

02:12.800 --> 02:15.302
I'm really sorry.

02:15.302 --> 02:18.222
Oh.

02:19.265 --> 02:20.474
Where are you going?

02:20.474 --> 02:21.934
Boss was counting on this.

02:21.934 --> 02:24.270
He likes to hear bad news
as soon as it happens.

02:24.270 --> 02:28.107
Look, it's just
really short notice, you know?

02:28.107 --> 02:30.568
<i>Our Town,</i>
those people were actors.

02:30.568 --> 02:32.486
Right? And Midge isn't an actor.

02:36.156 --> 02:38.742
How about I help you
find someone, huh?

02:38.742 --> 02:41.328
Boss likes the idea of
the cute dirty girl doing this.

02:41.328 --> 02:43.956
- Made him smile.
- A rarity, let me tell you.

02:43.956 --> 02:45.791
I got a magician
you guys will love.

02:45.791 --> 02:47.710
His hair is long.
I put him in a dress.

02:47.710 --> 02:51.964
- From a distance...
- Susie, this is me
asking you for a favor.

02:51.964 --> 02:53.883
You understand "favor"?

02:53.883 --> 02:55.134
Yeah, I understand "favor."

02:55.134 --> 02:57.011
See,
in a relationship like ours,

02:57.011 --> 02:59.722
based partly on mutual respect
and partly on the fact

02:59.722 --> 03:01.682
that I did a lot of
fucking favors for you--

03:01.682 --> 03:03.225
- the office...
- The furniture.

03:03.225 --> 03:04.643
...the not killing you
that time.

03:04.643 --> 03:06.729
- That was a good favor.
- But, see, this,

03:06.729 --> 03:09.398
when we come to you,
hat in hand,

03:09.398 --> 03:12.943
asking for a favor,
this is how you reciprocate.

03:12.943 --> 03:16.530
This is how payback works.

03:16.530 --> 03:18.449
So, I do this, it's payback.

03:18.449 --> 03:20.576
It is, and very nice of you.

03:20.576 --> 03:23.412
- And this counts as payback.
- Definitely counts.

03:23.412 --> 03:24.997
- You want to see
the paper again?
- No. I'm good.

03:24.997 --> 03:26.415
- I'll talk to Midge.
- Ah.

03:26.415 --> 03:27.958
The boss will be thrilled
to hear it.

in Wollman Rink?

04:29.478 --> 04:30.813

04:30.813 --> 04:32.064
Ah. Beats me.

04:32.064 --> 04:33.941
Had skates on.
Did I skate there?

04:33.941 --> 04:35.234
At least it was a skating rink.

04:35.234 --> 04:36.860
Yeah, but not the same rink
I started out in.

04:36.860 --> 04:39.488

Betty Porter wasn't there
last night.

04:44.159 --> 04:46.203
- Are you sure?
- She had a baby last Tuesday.

04:46.203 --> 04:48.122
- Baby?
- Christ. Who did I kiss?

04:48.122 --> 04:50.082
Betty Porter was pregnant?

04:50.082 --> 04:51.750
Drink up, boys.

04:51.750 --> 04:54.169
- Hair of the dog?
- No, thank you.
- Morning, boss.

04:54.169 --> 04:56.672
Midge, no one needs
that much happiness right now.

04:56.672 --> 04:59.466
Sorry. Geez, no one here
can hold their liquor?

04:59.466 --> 05:02.511

05:02.511 --> 05:04.221

05:05.681 --> 05:07.266
What are you insinuating?

05:07.266 --> 05:09.727
Midge, Gordon wants to see you
in the studio.

05:09.727 --> 05:11.895
- Oh. Now?
- Uh-huh.

more fun with a girl.

05:36.462 --> 05:39.256
New chair. Making sure
it maneuvers just right.

05:39.256 --> 05:41.008

is all about

05:41.008 --> 05:42.468
the charisma and the jokes,

05:42.468 --> 05:44.219
but really
it's all about the chair.

05:45.554 --> 05:47.514
Five point eight
from the Russian judge.

05:47.514 --> 05:49.933
Let's see Jack Paar do that.

05:49.933 --> 05:51.393
You seem to have
weathered the storm

05:51.393 --> 05:52.936
better than
the rest of the group.

05:52.936 --> 05:54.772
Mm. Scottish ancestry.

05:54.772 --> 05:56.940
And I've had three of Marge's
drinks and I've thrown up twice.

05:56.940 --> 05:58.567
- Huh.
- You look good.

05:58.567 --> 06:00.110
I never drink and skate.

06:00.110 --> 06:01.820
Yeah, I was a little tipsy
last night.

06:01.820 --> 06:03.197
- Were ya?
- Yes.

06:03.197 --> 06:04.823
I might've noticed.

06:04.823 --> 06:07.326
I just wanted to make sure that
you're okay with everything.

06:07.326 --> 06:09.286
With me, actually,
after the, uh,

06:09.286 --> 06:12.122
sort of, the thing
with the lips that touched.

06:12.122 --> 06:13.916
- The kiss.
- Is that what the kids
are calling it these days?

06:13.916 --> 06:15.042
I'm fine.

06:15.042 --> 06:17.336
Good. Good, I'm fine, too.

06:17.336 --> 06:19.755
Hey, since we're both fine,
what do you say we start over?

06:19.755 --> 06:21.590
- Meaning?
- Go out with me.

06:21.590 --> 06:23.634
Dinner. No ice. Solid ground.

06:23.634 --> 06:25.385
- I'm flattered, but...
- Come on.

06:25.385 --> 06:26.804
I can be quite charming
when I'm not plastered

06:26.804 --> 06:29.264
- and flat on my ass.
- No.

06:29.264 --> 06:32.101
- Give me one good reason.
- I can give you
30 good reasons.

06:32.101 --> 06:33.644
Okay, well,
I don't have time for 30,

06:33.644 --> 06:35.854
- but give me your top ten.
- One, you are not Jewish.

06:35.854 --> 06:38.565
Ah, I am Jewish.
Changed it from Fordberg. Next.

06:38.565 --> 06:41.318
- Two, you are my boss.
- You're fired. Three.

06:41.318 --> 06:43.070
How about I just skip to ten?
You're married.

06:43.070 --> 06:44.905
That's number ten?

06:44.905 --> 06:46.156
Interesting.

06:46.156 --> 06:48.200
Yes, I am married
but with a caveat.

06:48.200 --> 06:49.451
That's a new one.

06:49.451 --> 06:50.702
It's a very specific
kind of marriage.

06:50.702 --> 06:52.162
We have an understanding.

06:52.162 --> 06:53.664
As in, if there's a sock
on the door, don't come in?

06:53.664 --> 06:55.290
As in, she has her life
and I have mine.

06:55.290 --> 06:57.918
- That's called being single.
- My wife is a great lady.

06:57.918 --> 07:00.671
I admire her, I love her,

07:00.671 --> 07:02.714
- and she's very flexible.
- Contortionist?

07:02.714 --> 07:05.175
No. Well, yes, but no.

07:05.175 --> 07:06.885
Jack Paar dated a girl
on his show once,

07:06.885 --> 07:08.428
and then that girl was
mysteriously killed.

07:08.428 --> 07:09.930
I have never heard that story.

07:09.930 --> 07:11.598
- Ask Jack.
- I will.

07:11.598 --> 07:13.058
But even if that were true,
that's very unlikely

07:13.058 --> 07:14.518
to happen to you
here at 30 Rock.

07:14.518 --> 07:16.520
The worst that can happen is you
get fan-kicked by a Rockette.

07:16.520 --> 07:18.105
I'm not going out with you.

07:18.105 --> 07:20.149
I haven't even told you
where we're going.

07:20.149 --> 07:22.901
It would complicate my quest
to be on your show.

07:22.901 --> 07:25.863
- You are on my show.
- I mean "on" on your show.

07:25.863 --> 07:27.573
No. You're too pretty
to be "on" on my show.

07:27.573 --> 07:28.991
- No one would look at me.
- Well, I plan on

07:28.991 --> 07:30.576
walking through
a plate glass window later on.

07:30.576 --> 07:32.786
- You'd still be pretty.
- Excuse me.

07:32.786 --> 07:34.538
Sorry, Gordon.
Midge, you have a phone call.

07:34.538 --> 07:35.539
Thanks, Dorie.

07:38.709 --> 07:41.086
Seems I have
a very important phone call.

07:41.086 --> 07:43.964
I notice you tend to leave all
of our conversations unfinished.

07:43.964 --> 07:45.465
I have a problem with closure.

07:45.465 --> 07:47.342

07:59.980 --> 08:01.064
Hello?

08:01.064 --> 08:02.816
Hi. Listen.

08:02.816 --> 08:05.235
I got a weird call today
from Frank and Nicky.

08:05.235 --> 08:06.486
Oops.

08:06.486 --> 08:08.113
<i>Yeah, yeah,
I thought "oops," too,</i>

08:08.113 --> 08:09.907
originally, but I met with them,

08:09.907 --> 08:12.910
- and it may not be "oops"
after all.
- <i>Okay.</i>

08:12.910 --> 08:16.872
Uh, they're doing a show
at the Building New York Expo.

08:16.872 --> 08:18.415
Frank and Nicky
are doing a show?

08:18.415 --> 08:19.583
- <i>Yes.</i>
- Like performing in it?

08:19.583 --> 08:21.210
No, they're sort of
producing it.

08:21.210 --> 08:23.086
Are they hands-on producers
or just the money?

08:23.086 --> 08:25.255
- None of that is important.
- Well, if you're
in the show, it is.

08:25.255 --> 08:26.882
Can you stop your brain
for one second

08:26.882 --> 08:28.842
and take in all the information
before you speak?

08:28.842 --> 08:30.469
- No.
- <i>Fine.</i>

08:30.469 --> 08:32.095
Listen, they got this show,

08:32.095 --> 08:34.681
someone dropped out,
and they asked me for a favor.

08:34.681 --> 08:35.891
I'm back to "oops."

08:35.891 --> 08:37.559
It's not "oops."
Enough with the "oops."

08:37.559 --> 08:38.644
They want you to fill in.

08:38.644 --> 08:40.687
- Is it a stand-up show?
- <i>No.</i>

08:40.687 --> 08:43.190
It's like an industrial show.
Scripted stuff.

08:43.190 --> 08:44.399
I don't do scripted stuff.

08:44.399 --> 08:45.734
You did it on the radio.

08:45.734 --> 08:46.902
<i>No one could see me
on the radio.</i>

08:46.902 --> 08:48.695
I was visibly free to panic.

08:48.695 --> 08:49.947
It's two shows.

08:49.947 --> 08:51.573
I'm not asking you
to star in <i>Brigadoon.</i>

08:51.573 --> 08:53.742
I don't know.

08:53.742 --> 08:55.702
Look...
Susie Myerson
and Associates.

08:55.702 --> 08:57.162
She is on another call
right now.

08:57.162 --> 08:58.664
Okay, you were right.

08:58.664 --> 09:00.666
Frank and Nicky
come with strings.

09:00.666 --> 09:02.376
- Susie...
- <i>Yes.</i>

09:02.376 --> 09:03.961
Fine, I am an asshole.

09:03.961 --> 09:06.129
But here's the deal:
if you do this thing for them,

09:06.129 --> 09:09.007
this one favor, it'll be
considered reciprocation,

09:09.007 --> 09:10.634
meaning we're off the hook.

09:10.634 --> 09:12.094
I know what reciprocation means.

09:12.094 --> 09:13.428
<i>Well?</i>

09:13.428 --> 09:15.013
Do they know
what reciprocation means?

09:15.013 --> 09:16.807
Yes, it means I'm not
looking over my shoulder

09:16.807 --> 09:18.183
for the rest of my goddamn life.

09:20.185 --> 09:21.561
And what is this thing, again?

09:21.561 --> 09:24.231
Oh, the thing I saw was cute.

09:24.231 --> 09:26.858
Oh, they had
tulips dancing around.

09:26.858 --> 09:28.944
Girly shit. You love girly shit.

09:28.944 --> 09:30.362
And what about my day job?

09:30.362 --> 09:32.072
Tell 'em you're sick.
Lady troubles.

09:32.072 --> 09:34.199
I am not telling them
I have lady troubles.

09:34.199 --> 09:35.617
<i>It's a great excuse.</i>

09:35.617 --> 09:37.452
It could mean anything,
and I can guarantee you

09:37.452 --> 09:39.496
not one guy is gonna
ask you to clarify.

09:39.496 --> 09:42.291
Hey, what do you know
about Gordon's wife?

09:42.291 --> 09:44.293
- What?
- <i>His wife.</i>

09:44.293 --> 09:46.712
<i>I think her name's Hedy.</i>

09:46.712 --> 09:49.047
Nothing. Why? Nothing.

09:49.047 --> 09:50.257
They have a weird relationship,

09:50.257 --> 09:51.508
and I wondered
if you knew the story.

09:51.508 --> 09:53.385
Why the fuck would
I know the story?

09:53.385 --> 09:55.137
Who am I, Louella Parsons?

09:55.137 --> 09:56.930
<i>She's kind of a public figure,
so I thought...</i>

09:56.930 --> 09:58.473
I don't know anything
about wives.

09:58.473 --> 10:00.809
I don't like wives.
There shouldn't be wives.

10:00.809 --> 10:01.977
Okay. Sorry.

10:01.977 --> 10:04.313
Look, are you gonna do
this thing or not?

10:04.313 --> 10:06.064
<i>I went to an industrial once.</i>

10:06.064 --> 10:08.066
On a school trip.
It was fun, actually.

10:08.066 --> 10:10.319
I saw a Pyrex show
that changed my life.

10:10.319 --> 10:12.946
- Uh-huh.
- <i>Maybe I could have Joel
bring the kids down to see it.</i>

10:12.946 --> 10:15.324
It's gonna be years before I'll
let them watch my real show.

10:15.324 --> 10:17.868
Longer if they're screwed up
and I need them for material.

10:17.868 --> 10:19.286
So, you'll do it?

10:19.286 --> 10:21.204
<i>Sure. Let's reciprocate.</i>

10:21.204 --> 10:22.414
Thank you.

10:22.414 --> 10:23.582
You owe me.

10:23.582 --> 10:25.334
<i>Yeah. Story of my fucking life.</i>

10:25.334 --> 10:27.794
Hair of the dog?

10:29.796 --> 10:31.840
Mmm.

10:31.840 --> 10:33.342
Mmm!

10:33.342 --> 10:36.303
Zelda, this is delicious.
What is it?

10:36.303 --> 10:38.305
You like it? It's
an old-world recipe called...

10:38.305 --> 10:40.557
Stop! Don't tell me. Too scary.

10:40.557 --> 10:42.267
I just want to enjoy it.

10:42.267 --> 10:45.729
Miriam, pass some more of the
old-world mystery stew, please.

10:45.729 --> 10:48.065
- So pretty.
- Well, we haven't been
out to the theater

10:48.065 --> 10:50.275
and supper after with friends
in forever.

10:50.275 --> 10:51.943
I thought it was time
to break out the finery.

10:51.943 --> 10:53.153
Miriam, the bowl.

10:53.153 --> 10:55.197
This was Grandma's, right?

10:55.197 --> 10:56.365
It was my grandmother's, actually.

10:56.365 --> 10:57.491
Handed down to my mother
then to me.

10:57.491 --> 10:59.493
Then to me. Someday.

10:59.493 --> 11:01.578
Yeah, someday.

11:01.578 --> 11:03.789
Stop imagining my death.

11:03.789 --> 11:05.832
- I'm not imagining your death.
- Can someone please hand me...

11:05.832 --> 11:07.542
You're imagining
those earrings on your ears,

11:07.542 --> 11:09.044
which means I'm dead.

11:09.044 --> 11:11.588
Maybe you just decided to give
them to me for my next birthday.

11:11.588 --> 11:13.382
No, I'm dead.

11:13.382 --> 11:14.883
What's the show
you're going to see?

11:14.883 --> 11:17.094
Well, it's... That's disturbing.

11:17.094 --> 11:19.429
It's something written by
a friend of Abe's, right, Abe?

11:19.429 --> 11:21.515
Not a friend, exactly.

11:21.515 --> 11:23.934
He was a writer at <i>The Voice.</i>

11:23.934 --> 11:25.519
I knew him a little bit,

11:25.519 --> 11:27.729
but he left
soon after I got there.

11:27.729 --> 11:29.231
He was a fine fellow.

11:29.231 --> 11:31.983
I think there were real
friendship possibilities there,

11:31.983 --> 11:34.069
had he stayed, but he left.

11:34.069 --> 11:36.405
Long-distance relationships
rarely work.

11:36.405 --> 11:37.697
Well, I don't care who wrote it.

11:37.697 --> 11:39.741
I just want to
get dressed up and go out.

11:39.741 --> 11:41.618
I hope everyone is roomy
for dessert.

11:41.618 --> 11:43.620
It's very special.
Janusz made it.

11:43.620 --> 11:45.539
It looks lovely, Janusz.

11:45.539 --> 11:49.209
It is a babka with a special
rum syrup and candy violets,

11:49.209 --> 11:50.752
- just like my mother
used to make.
- Aw.

11:50.752 --> 11:52.546
The little ones are having
pieces in the kitchen now.

11:52.546 --> 11:54.506
I put little plastic soldiers
on theirs.

11:54.506 --> 11:56.133
They thought that was fun.

11:56.133 --> 11:58.093
Oh, put it here, Zelda.
I'm done.

11:58.093 --> 12:00.804
Whoa, Janusz, this seems like
it has a lot of booze in it.

12:00.804 --> 12:03.014
Oh, no, no, no.
That's just the smell.

12:03.014 --> 12:05.016
The rum all burns off
in the baking. Try.

12:05.016 --> 12:06.560
Should I put some soldiers
on it for you?

12:06.560 --> 12:08.145
I'm a pacifist, but thank you.

12:08.145 --> 12:09.563
Ah.

12:33.253 --> 12:35.505
They'll sleep well tonight.

12:35.505 --> 12:37.215
Okay.

12:40.469 --> 12:42.220
Building
New York,

12:42.220 --> 12:45.348
<i>where the greatest city in
New York keeps getting better.</i>

12:45.348 --> 12:46.850
How'd you
get here?

12:46.850 --> 12:48.226
<i>Don't you live on Staten Island?</i>

12:48.226 --> 12:50.270
I took
the new Verazzano Bridge.

14:01.967 --> 14:04.928
That is an excellent neckline
for you, Midge.

14:04.928 --> 14:08.223
- Same to you, Nicky.
- I hope Susie expressed to you

14:08.223 --> 14:10.725
our deepest gratitude
for doing this.

14:10.725 --> 14:13.311
She has expressed
many things, yes.

14:13.311 --> 14:15.814
Good. So, Jerome here...
Where are you?

14:15.814 --> 14:18.316
- Uh... No.
- Don't fucking hide from me.

14:18.316 --> 14:21.528
You'd think these show business
types would be so outgoing,

14:21.528 --> 14:23.780
but I got to tell you,
I find them a total mess.

14:23.780 --> 14:26.199
- Shaking, crying.
- Very nervous bunch.

14:26.199 --> 14:27.951
Anyhow, Jerome is our writer,

14:27.951 --> 14:31.079
and he's making some quick
adjustments, emphasis on quick.

14:31.079 --> 14:32.747
- Very quick.
- Nice to meet you, Jerome.

14:32.747 --> 14:35.208
Apologies for getting
the pages to you so late.

14:35.208 --> 14:36.960
We had a lot of reworking to do.

14:36.960 --> 14:38.712
Anyway, here's your costume.

14:38.712 --> 14:41.006
It's got a little hat.
I knew you'd like that.

14:41.006 --> 14:42.674
Jerome, pages.

14:42.674 --> 14:44.801
Uh, it would be terrific
if you were off-book.

14:44.801 --> 14:46.970
But if you have to cheat
a little, we understand.

14:46.970 --> 14:48.763
Ah, here we are.

14:48.763 --> 14:50.932
Uh... what's this?

14:50.932 --> 14:53.184
- This is your stage.
- Biggest one in the joint.

14:53.184 --> 14:55.103
Had to wrestle it out
from under the bricklayers.

14:55.103 --> 14:56.771
Those motherfuckers don't budge.

14:56.771 --> 14:59.232
But what is waste management?

14:59.232 --> 15:00.692
I'm doing waste management?

15:00.692 --> 15:03.528
Private demolition
and waste management.

15:03.528 --> 15:05.030
I'm hawking garbage?

15:05.030 --> 15:06.990
Garbage disposal.

15:06.990 --> 15:08.325
Huh.

15:08.325 --> 15:09.576
You sound disappointed.

15:09.576 --> 15:11.578
Well, no, but I just saw
the pretty kitchen

15:11.578 --> 15:13.371
and the oven
that hands you a cake, and I...

15:13.371 --> 15:15.206
Did Susie not tell you about
the slip of paper?

15:15.206 --> 15:17.083
- Buy yourself a cake.
- Sure.

15:17.083 --> 15:20.003
So, you should get changed
and learn those lines.

15:20.003 --> 15:21.963
Jerome. Run 'em with her.

15:28.303 --> 15:31.348
Next stop,

15:51.242 --> 15:53.119
- Yes.
- That suit
doesn't even fit you.

15:53.119 --> 15:55.205
It's not for me.
It's for a 200-pound guy

15:55.205 --> 15:56.498
hiding out in Binghamton.

15:56.498 --> 15:57.707
And from the smell
of this thing,

15:57.707 --> 15:59.084
he shit his pants
before he left.

15:59.084 --> 16:01.086
- Jesus.
- It came with a cigar stub.

16:01.086 --> 16:02.462
It's still wet.

16:02.462 --> 16:04.422
- No.
- I am not putting it

Gee, you sure know

- Where's the cigar stub?
- I'm having it dry-cleaned.

16:29.864 --> 16:32.367
- It's a great prop.
- It says so much
about the character.

16:32.367 --> 16:33.910
- Try it.
- Not without a tetanus shot.

16:33.910 --> 16:35.704
Suit yourself.
Still fucking adorable.

16:35.704 --> 16:38.039
- Right, Susie?
- I'm gonna get one for myself.

16:38.039 --> 16:40.625
- It's time.
- Oh, I've got butterflies.

16:40.625 --> 16:42.752
We'll be over there watching.

16:45.630 --> 16:48.383
- Wait, where are you going?
- I got some work.

16:48.383 --> 16:51.469
- Fuck you. This is your work.
- I do not want to watch this.

16:51.469 --> 16:53.388
I am not reciprocating
alone here.

16:53.388 --> 16:54.723

17:24.669 --> 17:26.921
the greatest city
in the whole wide world.

17:26.921 --> 17:30.008
I sure am lucky
I live here. Amen.

17:38.141 --> 17:40.059
Hey, guys,
he's asleep.

19:49.856 --> 19:52.525
Wow.
Smell that fresh, sweet air.

19:52.525 --> 19:54.444
You'd never know
that just last night,

19:54.444 --> 19:57.614
there was a mound of trash
as high as an elephant's eye.

19:57.614 --> 19:59.949
High enough that
the Von Trapp Family Singers

19:59.949 --> 20:02.535
could climb over it
to escape the Nazis.

20:03.578 --> 20:07.165
That's pretty high,
but now look at it. Gone.

20:07.165 --> 20:10.335
Now all you see are
sidewalks so clean

20:10.335 --> 20:11.836
you could eat off of them.

20:11.836 --> 20:14.672
Streets so gleaming
you could see your reflection.

20:15.757 --> 20:18.217
Hmm, looks like
I need a shave.

20:18.217 --> 20:19.552
Extra! Extra!

20:19.552 --> 20:21.554
Oh, look, there's the paperboy.

20:21.554 --> 20:23.139
New York's rooster.

20:23.139 --> 20:24.724
Looks like it's that time again.

20:24.724 --> 20:27.393
The city's waking up.

20:27.393 --> 20:30.980
All these happy people
excited to start their day.

20:30.980 --> 20:33.232
Why, there's young mothers
with babies

20:33.232 --> 20:35.526
There's a businessman
with a briefcase,

20:35.526 --> 20:37.362
off to conquer the world.

20:37.362 --> 20:39.364
Storekeepers ready
to sell their goods

20:39.364 --> 20:42.408
and waitresses rushing to
get you those sunny-side up eggs

20:42.408 --> 20:44.661
you need to get you
through your day.

20:44.661 --> 20:47.872
All these people
walking down cleared sidewalks,

20:47.872 --> 20:49.248
nothing in their way.

20:49.248 --> 20:51.292
And yet some people think
the city is responsible

20:51.292 --> 20:52.919
for this modern miracle.

20:52.919 --> 20:55.672
But I'll tell you a secret:
it's not.

20:55.672 --> 20:58.758
It's not?
- No, little boy, it's not.

20:58.758 --> 21:02.178
The city only disposes of
a small amount of actual trash

21:02.178 --> 21:04.222
that is thrown away,
the easy stuff,

21:04.222 --> 21:06.015
but we live in a big city.

21:06.015 --> 21:08.184
- We have big city trash.
- That's right.

21:08.184 --> 21:10.228
And to get rid of
big city trash,

21:10.228 --> 21:12.397
you're going to need
private demolition

21:12.397 --> 21:13.773
and waste management.

21:13.773 --> 21:16.401
What is private demolition
and waste management?

21:16.401 --> 21:19.112
Well, it's a company that
you pay to take away everything

21:19.112 --> 21:21.322
that the city won't,
and unlike the city,

21:21.322 --> 21:23.157
they never say no.

21:23.157 --> 21:25.410
Hello, old-timer.

21:25.410 --> 21:28.079
- What you got there?
- I just got my bill here.

21:28.079 --> 21:30.707
- A bill for what?
- I ran into some old paint,

21:30.707 --> 21:34.544
rat poison, liquid chemicals,
DDT and a broken bookshelf,

21:34.544 --> 21:36.254
and I wanted someone
to take it all away.

21:36.254 --> 21:38.881
Then I got this estimate,
ten dollars.

21:38.881 --> 21:41.843
Just to pick some trash up
and take it far away from me?

21:41.843 --> 21:44.345
- Are they kidding?
- Ten dollars isn't much.

21:44.345 --> 21:46.472
It's ridiculous. I won't pay it.

21:46.472 --> 21:48.099
I'll just put it out
with my city trash.

21:48.099 --> 21:49.851
The city won't take that,
old-timer.

21:49.851 --> 21:51.602
Well,
then I'll just take it down

21:51.602 --> 21:54.439
to the church preschool
parking lot on the corner

21:54.439 --> 21:55.940
and burn it, problem solved.

21:55.940 --> 21:58.192
- You sure you want to do that?
- I certainly do.

21:58.192 --> 22:00.403
As far as I'm concerned,
I wish I'd never heard

22:00.403 --> 22:02.405
of private demolition
and waste management.

23:00.213 --> 23:02.048
Oh, no,
that looks like something

23:02.048 --> 23:04.258
the demolition of a giant
building might've caused.

23:04.258 --> 23:06.260
It did. I thought
the city would've hauled away

23:06.260 --> 23:08.221
all the dangerous
demolition waste.

23:08.221 --> 23:10.389
The city doesn't
haul that away, old-timer.

23:10.389 --> 23:12.183
I know.
- I tried to warn you.

23:12.183 --> 23:14.477
- You did.
- You need private demolition

23:14.477 --> 23:16.312
and waste management to do that,

23:16.312 --> 23:17.730
but you didn't want
to pay for it.

23:17.730 --> 23:21.818
I didn't want to pay for it,
and now my boy is gone!

23:21.818 --> 23:23.069
Yes, he is.

23:23.069 --> 23:25.696
Happy people die every day
from trash.

23:25.696 --> 23:27.782
Ten thousand tons
of garbage accumulate

23:27.782 --> 23:29.826
in New York City
every single hour.

23:29.826 --> 23:34.038
The average person throws out
2.68 pounds of garbage per day,

23:34.038 --> 23:36.124
and that's a really thin person.

23:36.124 --> 23:40.002
Mismanaged waste kills up to
a million people a year globally

23:40.002 --> 23:43.881
and can potentially carry
diphtheria, dysentery,

23:43.881 --> 23:46.634
hepatitis A and B and C
and D and E,

23:46.634 --> 23:49.846
meningitis, cancer, tetanus,
tuberculosis, pneumonia,

23:49.846 --> 23:53.057
influenza, syphilis and
assorted blood-borne pathogens,

23:53.057 --> 23:55.893
parasitic infections,
zoonotic illnesses,

23:55.893 --> 23:57.979
plus there won't be
any place to park.

23:57.979 --> 24:00.148
I can't hear any more.
I'm convinced.

24:00.148 --> 24:03.109
Private demolition and
waste management is important.

24:03.109 --> 24:05.236
It's important! Oh!

24:05.236 --> 24:06.821
It is important.

24:06.821 --> 24:10.032
People think happiness is such
a difficult thing to attain,

24:10.032 --> 24:11.784
when in reality
it all comes down

24:11.784 --> 24:13.244
to the little things in life:

24:13.244 --> 24:16.414
family, friends, smiles

24:16.414 --> 24:19.167
and private demolition
and waste management.

24:19.167 --> 24:21.711
The truth is
right in front of your face,

24:21.711 --> 24:23.713
or on the sole of your shoe.

24:23.713 --> 24:25.256

25:09.884 --> 25:12.345
Well, I was a little behind
at the beginning, I admit.

25:12.345 --> 25:14.305
It took me 45 minutes to realize
she was talking about the dog...

25:14.305 --> 25:15.681
It's as if each play was written
by a different person.

25:15.681 --> 25:17.266
I don't know his theater work.

25:17.266 --> 25:18.726
I only know his writing
in <i>The Voice.</i>

25:18.726 --> 25:21.145
Well, his theater work is
infinitely better.

25:21.145 --> 25:22.730
Oh, he'd love to hear that, Abe.

25:22.730 --> 25:25.149
I just mean that
i-in the theater,

25:25.149 --> 25:27.526
he can explore
more meaningful subjects.

25:27.526 --> 25:29.570
There are layers
to his work onstage.

25:29.570 --> 25:32.156
- Some of his work.
- <i>The Taskmaster?</i>

25:32.156 --> 25:33.908
Oh, sure,
pick the one great one,

25:33.908 --> 25:35.451
but <i>A Bridge to a Road?</i>

25:35.451 --> 25:37.119
- Terrible title.
- Terrible play.

25:37.119 --> 25:38.913
- I don't think so. Abe?
- But a couple of
terrific monologues.

25:38.913 --> 25:41.123
Abe, that was
an Irish accent, right?

25:41.123 --> 25:44.001
- Dublin.
- Dublin. I assume he means
the Dublin in Ireland.

25:44.001 --> 25:46.254
You do realize
he's sitting right over there?

25:46.254 --> 25:48.381
- Where?
- Right th... Carl!

25:48.381 --> 25:50.132
- One of your best.
- Hear, hear.

25:50.132 --> 25:51.759
- Congratulations.
- It was wonderful.
- Well done.

25:51.759 --> 25:54.428
Well, now I feel a little dirty.

25:54.428 --> 25:56.764
- Who was that?
- That was the playwright.

25:56.764 --> 26:00.393
- Really? He looks so normal.
- Like a bank teller.

26:00.393 --> 26:02.770
Well, he's not a bank teller.
He's a talented writer.

26:02.770 --> 26:04.438
Occasionally, yes, he is.

26:04.438 --> 26:05.815
Better to be a bank teller.

26:05.815 --> 26:07.275
A bank teller
can always get a job.

26:07.275 --> 26:09.735
But seriously, Abe,
you liked this play tonight?

26:09.735 --> 26:11.737
I did.
I thought his contemplation

26:11.737 --> 26:13.739
on God and religion,

26:13.739 --> 26:17.076
the parallels between marriage
and death and madness--

26:17.076 --> 26:20.413
though a little heavy-handed--
was extremely thoughtful.

26:20.413 --> 26:22.832
My goodness.
When did all of that happen?

26:22.832 --> 26:24.542
That's what the play was about.

26:24.542 --> 26:26.961
Really? I thought it was about
a little boy who loses his dog.

26:26.961 --> 26:29.046
- In Dublin.
- Yes, in Dublin.

26:29.046 --> 26:31.841
No, that was just
a device he used

26:31.841 --> 26:35.970
to talk about the man's
confusion with his sexuality

26:35.970 --> 26:38.973
and his tortured relationship
with Jesus.

26:38.973 --> 26:40.891
When did they mention Jesus?

26:40.891 --> 26:44.270
They didn't have to mention it.
Jesus was all over the place.

26:44.270 --> 26:48.149
His wife's name was Mary.
He wore sandals, the wine.

26:48.149 --> 26:51.068
He owned a bar. Wouldn't they
have wine in a bar?

26:51.068 --> 26:53.112
You know, they usually don't
have very good wine in a bar.

26:53.112 --> 26:55.531
- It's always warm.
- I never order wine in a bar.

26:55.531 --> 26:57.158
When are you ever in a bar?

26:57.158 --> 26:59.285
Never, which is why
I never order wine in a bar.

26:59.285 --> 27:01.620
Well, I didn't notice
any of these things.

27:01.620 --> 27:04.457
I thought it was a very touching
story of a boy and his dog.

27:04.457 --> 27:06.500
And the dog was terrific. Wonderful.

27:06.500 --> 27:09.045
Oh, wait. Last November.
I was in a bar last November.

27:09.045 --> 27:10.254
With whom?

27:10.254 --> 27:12.965
That wasn't what
the play was about at all, Rose.

27:12.965 --> 27:15.176
But I agree with you
about the dog.

27:15.176 --> 27:18.179
They never mention Jesus or his
confusion with his sexuality.

27:18.179 --> 27:21.098
- They don't have to mention it.
- Well, it would certainly help.

27:21.098 --> 27:22.892
Anyhow,
that's not the play I saw.

27:22.892 --> 27:25.311
Art is there
for your interpretation, Rose.

27:25.311 --> 27:27.563
No, it's not.

27:27.563 --> 27:30.733
You don't just decide the story
is whatever you want it to be.

27:30.733 --> 27:32.568
I didn't decide anything.

27:32.568 --> 27:34.528
I watched a boy
and his dog who died.

27:34.528 --> 27:37.865
- But it wasn't about that.
- How do you know?

27:37.865 --> 27:41.202
I am a theater critic.
I'm paid to know.

27:41.202 --> 27:43.329
It's fine if you didn't get it.

27:43.329 --> 27:45.873
It's not <i>Guys and Dolls.</i>

27:48.209 --> 27:50.711
Well, I just loved her dress.

27:50.711 --> 27:51.921
Well, I need another drink.

27:51.921 --> 27:53.214
You loved <i>Guys and Dolls.</i>

27:53.214 --> 27:55.174
Of course I did.
It was a delight.

27:55.174 --> 27:57.385
- Tuppance, drink?
- I saw <i>Guys and Dolls</i> with...

27:57.385 --> 27:58.886
Is it possible, Abe,
that you're wrong?

27:58.886 --> 28:01.514
That the play tonight was not
actually a deep meditation

28:01.514 --> 28:03.641
on Jesus
and latent homosexuality

28:03.641 --> 28:07.812
but instead a sweet, simple play
about a boy who lost his dog?

28:07.812 --> 28:10.189
- No.
- It's not possible?

28:10.189 --> 28:12.274
- Under any circumstances?
- No, Rose,

28:12.274 --> 28:15.152
and I don't know why you're
getting so upset over this.

28:15.152 --> 28:18.989
- Because you're calling me
an idiot.
- I am not calling you an idiot.

28:18.989 --> 28:22.451
I simply said
you don't understand the play,

28:22.451 --> 28:25.454
- at all. That's fine.
- Because I'm an idiot.

28:25.454 --> 28:27.498
Retreat, retreat, retreat.

28:27.498 --> 28:29.708
Rose, just because
you can't grasp

28:29.708 --> 28:32.044
a complex thematic piece
like this

28:32.044 --> 28:34.713
is not some reflection
on your intelligence.

28:34.713 --> 28:38.175
I don't understand
anything that you do.

28:38.175 --> 28:39.885
Does that make me an idiot?

28:39.885 --> 28:42.471
- I'm gonna have dessert.
- Me, too.

28:42.471 --> 28:44.098
You know what?
Maybe you're right.

28:44.098 --> 28:46.308
- Thank you.
- Let's ask the man
who wrote it.

28:46.308 --> 28:48.310
What? No, Rose.

28:48.310 --> 28:49.770
You do not interrupt
a post-opening meal.

28:49.770 --> 28:51.981
Not until the good reviews
come out. Rose!

28:51.981 --> 28:54.984
Excuse me.
I'm Rose Weissman, Abe's wife.

28:54.984 --> 28:58.821
We just saw your play tonight,
and, um, do you mind?

28:58.821 --> 29:02.032
- Oh, well, I, uh...
- Thank you so much.

29:02.032 --> 29:03.951
I was just wondering
if you could tell us

29:03.951 --> 29:05.536
what you think
your play's about.

29:05.536 --> 29:07.788
He wrote it, Rose.
He knows what it's about.

29:07.788 --> 29:10.207
- Hello, Carl.
- Hello, Abe.

29:10.207 --> 29:12.334
The sound design was terrific.

29:12.334 --> 29:14.003
Well, fine. Tell me, then.

29:14.003 --> 29:15.588
What was your play about?

29:15.588 --> 29:18.007
Well, when I was a boy,
I had a dog named Tom,

29:18.007 --> 29:19.717
and he died very suddenly
one summer,

29:19.717 --> 29:22.470
and I never really got over it.

29:22.470 --> 29:24.597
Is that it?

29:24.597 --> 29:26.682
I-It was very scarring.

29:33.522 --> 29:35.107
Now the
Crusaders come into this game

29:35.107 --> 29:38.360
<i>sporting a 26 and 2 record,
while the Marksmen have...</i>

30:01.926 --> 30:03.552
Oh! Mr. and Mrs. Weissman!

30:03.552 --> 30:05.763
Janusz just proposed,
and I said yes!

30:05.763 --> 30:07.640
- She said yes.
- Can I make you a sandwich?

30:07.640 --> 30:10.351
What? No. No. You proposed?

30:10.351 --> 30:12.061
- And I said yes.
- She said yes.

30:12.061 --> 30:13.312
How about an omelet?

30:13.312 --> 30:15.022
No. No omelet.

30:15.022 --> 30:17.566
Oh, Zelda. I'm so happy for you.

30:17.566 --> 30:19.443
Thank you, Mrs. Weissman.

30:19.443 --> 30:21.070
I will clean up the rose petals
after dessert.

30:21.070 --> 30:22.530
You've got yourself
a wonderful woman.

30:22.530 --> 30:24.114
Thank you, Mr. Weissman.

30:24.114 --> 30:25.783
I fixed the light
in the linen closet.

30:25.783 --> 30:27.493
Oh, good.

30:27.493 --> 30:30.496
- Well, good night.
- Yes. Good night.

30:47.471 --> 30:49.139
I finished the dishes.

30:49.139 --> 30:50.641
I moved furniture back.

30:50.641 --> 30:52.726
What a wonderful evening.

30:52.726 --> 30:55.437
The door needs oil.

32:35.079 --> 32:36.789
- Wow.
- This was performed?

32:36.789 --> 32:38.999
- In front of live people?
- Unfortunately, yes.

32:38.999 --> 32:41.293
- We work too hard.
- I just want it
a little better.

32:41.293 --> 32:42.795
Please, any suggestion at all.

32:42.795 --> 32:44.630
Adam, come on. Jump in here.
Your wife's so fat that...

32:44.630 --> 32:46.298
Well, that's just rude.

32:46.298 --> 32:48.092
No. You're always making
"my wife's so fat" jokes.

32:48.092 --> 32:49.760
The woman's had three kids.

32:49.760 --> 32:51.762
You try losing the baby weight
after three kids.

32:51.762 --> 32:53.347
Alvin,
is the script ready yet?

32:53.347 --> 32:55.557
- Almost.
- 'Cause I should be
typing it already.

32:55.557 --> 32:57.434
- One second, Trudy.
- Should I bring in
my typewriter?

32:57.434 --> 32:59.728
- Will it make you happy, Trudy?
- Gordon's gonna need it soon.

32:59.728 --> 33:01.480
Even if I had
a better opening joke.

33:01.480 --> 33:03.315
We have to finish
our real work first, Midge.

33:03.315 --> 33:05.401
I was gonna pitch the kid should
get a pole through his head,

33:05.401 --> 33:07.277
- but that's already taken.
- What about a pogo stick?

33:07.277 --> 33:09.446
Goddamn it, George!

33:09.446 --> 33:10.989
Ah, I can't believe
this is happening!

33:10.989 --> 33:13.200
We will
fix this, Gordon.

33:16.078 --> 33:18.831
- No one saw him go?
- He was in the makeup chair.

33:18.831 --> 33:20.374
Sally went to get
some more cotton balls.

33:20.374 --> 33:22.334
When she came back, he was gone.

33:22.334 --> 33:24.545
- Did I need to know about
the cotton balls, Marge?
- No, Gordon.

33:24.545 --> 33:26.338
Was that information
pertinent to this situation?

33:26.338 --> 33:28.632
- I'm just filling you in, Gordon.
- Oh! Well, thank you.

33:28.632 --> 33:30.259
Any other random facts
you want to throw in there?

33:30.259 --> 33:31.760
What was the temperature
of the room when he left?

33:31.760 --> 33:33.178
Was he cold?
Maybe he needed a sweater.

33:33.178 --> 33:34.430
Maybe that's why

33:34.430 --> 33:35.806
20 minutes before
I'm supposed to go on air,

33:35.806 --> 33:37.933
my fucking comedian takes off
and no one notices.

33:37.933 --> 33:39.518
Have we checked
the sweater room?

33:39.518 --> 33:41.687
Do we have a sweater room?
Maybe we need a sweater room.

33:41.687 --> 33:43.021
George, call a guy.

33:43.021 --> 33:44.440
I want a sweater room installed
right now.

33:44.440 --> 33:45.858
Okay.
Are you serious about that?

33:45.858 --> 33:47.609
No, I'm not serious about
installing a sweater room.

33:47.609 --> 33:49.862
I am serious about the fact
that I'm now missing a guest,

33:49.862 --> 33:51.864
and is anyone doing
anything about that? Mike?

33:51.864 --> 33:53.323
- I'm on it, Gordon.
- You are my talent booker.

33:53.323 --> 33:54.908
Book me some goddamn talent.
Marge?

33:54.908 --> 33:56.577
- Yes?
- Was I just an asshole to you?

33:56.577 --> 33:58.787
- Yes.
- I'm sorry. Buy yourself
some flowers. Mike?

33:58.787 --> 34:00.205
Got his manager on the line now.

34:00.205 --> 34:02.291
How? How does he just leave?

34:02.291 --> 34:04.376
He's unstable.
That's why he's funny.

34:04.376 --> 34:06.336
- Eh, he's not that funny.
- He could come back.

34:06.336 --> 34:08.088
I don't think he's coming back.

34:08.088 --> 34:10.883
He took his coat, his hat and
a <i>Gordon Ford Show</i> coffee mug.

34:10.883 --> 34:12.718
From now on, no one gets a mug

34:12.718 --> 34:15.304
until after they've actually
appeared on the show.

34:15.304 --> 34:17.973
- Am I clear? Mike?
- No coffee mugs
until after the show.

34:17.973 --> 34:20.309
- I mean where are we
with a comic, Mike?
- Doing my best, Gordon.

34:20.309 --> 34:23.187
Okay, well, bright side,
it's the final slot.

34:23.187 --> 34:25.981
People may have tuned out
by then.

34:25.981 --> 34:27.566
Is that the bright side, George?

34:27.566 --> 34:29.276
That people have tuned out
before the show is even over?

34:29.276 --> 34:32.446
No, I mean, why don't we just
extend the next to last guest,

34:32.446 --> 34:34.364
- the guy from the Bronx Zoo?
- Oh, God.

34:34.364 --> 34:36.241
We'll just ask him
to bring out a third animal.

34:36.241 --> 34:37.910
No. No, no, no, no, no.
I'm-I'm not pretending

34:37.910 --> 34:39.536
to give a shit
about three animals.

34:39.536 --> 34:40.913
I don't give a shit
about two animals.

34:40.913 --> 34:43.290
One animal can go fuck himself.
I want a comic!

34:43.290 --> 34:46.293
Writers!

34:46.293 --> 34:48.504
Pay close attention!

34:48.504 --> 34:50.297
Any loser stand-ups
that you know,

34:50.297 --> 34:51.965
that you're friends with,
went to school with,

34:51.965 --> 34:53.425
that you bowl with,
who fucked your cousin

34:53.425 --> 34:55.260
or who you might be related to,
call them.

34:55.260 --> 34:57.179
Bring them in, Mike will vet
them, and even if they stink,

34:57.179 --> 34:59.097
he will still give them
the thumbs up.

34:59.097 --> 35:01.225
I repeat, anyone breathing
with a tight six minutes,

35:01.225 --> 35:03.060
it's their goddamn lucky day.

35:03.060 --> 35:05.687
Mike! You and that Rolodex,
my office, now!

35:05.687 --> 35:07.231
Yep!

35:11.360 --> 35:12.903
Come on, guys,
someone must know someone.

35:12.903 --> 35:14.488
Gee, Alvin, I don't know.

35:14.488 --> 35:16.031
Got a dozen
knock-knock jokes.

35:16.031 --> 35:18.283
No? Nobody?
Cecil,
what about your dad?

35:18.283 --> 35:22.955
Now, this is going to be
a very nice house,

35:22.955 --> 35:26.792
so I'd appreciate if you didn't
immediately shit all over it.

35:26.792 --> 35:29.253
You have an entire city
out there.

35:29.253 --> 35:30.838
Crap to your heart's content.

35:32.464 --> 35:35.217
Susie Myerson and...
Yep. Yep, she's right here.

35:35.217 --> 35:37.219
It's Midge.

35:37.219 --> 35:38.554
Hey there.

35:38.554 --> 35:40.430
how much trouble will you get in

35:40.430 --> 35:42.057
if I don't do
the garbage show today?

35:42.057 --> 35:43.517
You mean
how many limbs will I lose?

35:43.517 --> 35:44.893
<i>- Yes.
-</i> And will I miss them?

35:44.893 --> 35:46.728
- <i>Right.</i>
- I'd say four and I would.

35:46.728 --> 35:49.106
There's a chance I might be
on the show tonight.

35:49.106 --> 35:51.316
<i>- What show?
- The Gordon Ford Show.</i>

35:51.316 --> 35:52.776
Fuck.

35:52.776 --> 35:54.403
Is that a bad "fuck"
or a good "fuck"?

35:54.403 --> 35:56.446
It's a bad "fuck" at the moment,
but it could turn into

35:56.446 --> 35:58.198
a good "fuck"
if you get on the show.

35:58.198 --> 36:00.826
It's basically a very flexible
"fuck." What's going on?

36:00.826 --> 36:02.578
Things are happening.
Stay by the phone.

36:02.578 --> 36:04.246
I'll call you back.

36:04.246 --> 36:06.456
Diller's in Paris,
Schreiber's in Denver,

36:06.456 --> 36:09.459
Sahl's sick.
Stiller said yes, Meara said no.

36:09.459 --> 36:12.170
She never forgave
that crack about her upper arms.

36:12.170 --> 36:14.590
Waiting to hear from Storch
and Allen. Should I try Hope?

36:14.590 --> 36:15.799
No.

36:15.799 --> 36:17.009
Fuck. Yes.

36:17.009 --> 36:19.177
Okay. Be right back.

36:22.347 --> 36:24.266
- Gordon?
- Yeah?

36:25.267 --> 36:27.978
- Put me in, Coach.
- What?

36:27.978 --> 36:30.272
I've got 20 clean,
broadcast-friendly minutes

36:30.272 --> 36:31.481
on various topics.

36:31.481 --> 36:33.150
I've got family jokes,
political jokes.

36:33.150 --> 36:35.527
I've got political family jokes.
I'm ready.

36:35.527 --> 36:37.112
For what?

36:37.112 --> 36:38.447
To go on the show.

36:38.447 --> 36:40.324
- This show?
- Yes.

36:40.324 --> 36:42.117
What other show is there?

36:42.117 --> 36:44.119
Tina, could you give me
a minute, please?

36:44.119 --> 36:46.038
- Don't touch your nose.
- I will not touch my nose.

36:46.038 --> 36:48.540
- Don't touch his nose.
- Mm-hmm.

36:49.750 --> 36:52.294
So? What do you think?

36:52.294 --> 36:54.254
I think, yes,
you should not touch my nose.

36:54.254 --> 36:56.465
Come on.
It solves all your problems.

36:56.465 --> 36:58.050
I'm right here, I will not
disappear from the green room,

36:58.050 --> 36:59.468
and I just had my hair done.

36:59.468 --> 37:00.886
- Midge...
- I'll run the jokes
by the team.

37:00.886 --> 37:02.095
I'll even ask Alvin
for his opinion,

37:02.095 --> 37:03.263
even though I truly don't care.

37:03.263 --> 37:05.891
- It's not gonna happen.
- Why not?

37:05.891 --> 37:07.559
Thank you for offering.

37:08.602 --> 37:10.395
Is this because
I won't go out with you?

37:10.395 --> 37:12.522
- I don't think
that's been settled yet.
- It's pretty settled.

37:12.522 --> 37:13.774
Not the way I remember it.

37:13.774 --> 37:15.400
Me dating you
and the Dreyfus affair. Settled.

37:15.400 --> 37:17.402
- No, this is not because
you won't go out with me.
- Then why?

37:17.402 --> 37:18.445
Because I'm too pretty?

37:18.445 --> 37:20.739
No, but you are very pretty.

37:20.739 --> 37:22.866
We have a rule here, hard
and fast, never been broken.

37:22.866 --> 37:25.077
No one who works on the show
can be on the show.

37:25.077 --> 37:27.245
Well, that's a dumb rule.
Change that rule.

37:27.245 --> 37:29.081
I'm not gonna change that rule.

37:29.081 --> 37:30.457
Gordon, I'm a stand-up.

37:30.457 --> 37:33.168
- You saw me. You liked me.
- I did.

37:33.168 --> 37:34.461
No exceptions.

37:34.461 --> 37:36.171
I want to be on your couch.

37:36.171 --> 37:38.173
- Oh, well, sure...
- No, not that couch.

37:38.173 --> 37:39.967
- Sorry.
- This is dumb.

37:39.967 --> 37:41.802
You have an empty slot to fill.

37:41.802 --> 37:44.262
You said, and I quote:
"Any loser comic."

37:44.262 --> 37:45.764
You even said they could stink.

37:45.764 --> 37:47.182
You know Ralph's a stand-up?

37:47.182 --> 37:48.767
I did not know that.

37:48.767 --> 37:51.019
He really wants to be
on the show.

37:51.019 --> 37:52.854
Ralph's never coming
on the show.

37:52.854 --> 37:54.564
- Okay, but...
- Cecil's a comic, too.

37:54.564 --> 37:56.608
A good one. Cecil's never
coming on the show.

37:56.608 --> 37:59.027
- Mel's a stand-up.
- I know about Mel.

37:59.027 --> 38:00.237
Works all the time.
People love him.

38:00.237 --> 38:01.405
Mel's never coming on the show.

38:01.405 --> 38:03.991
This is an arbitrary rule.

38:03.991 --> 38:05.951
Willie tried. You know Willie?

38:05.951 --> 38:07.452
The security guard?

38:07.452 --> 38:10.330
Singer.
Beautiful baritone voice.

38:10.330 --> 38:12.499
- Willie's not coming
on the show.
- Gordon...

38:12.499 --> 38:14.084
You make a good living here, right?

38:14.084 --> 38:17.212
- I do.
- It's nice, the paycheck.

38:17.212 --> 38:18.505
That should be enough.

38:19.548 --> 38:21.466
Well, guess that's it.

38:21.466 --> 38:23.301
That's it.

38:24.344 --> 38:26.388
Thank you for your time.

38:26.388 --> 38:28.724
Now, I have to go, or I'll be
late for my garbage gig.

38:28.724 --> 38:30.767
I have no context
for what you just said.

38:30.767 --> 38:33.061
Send Tina back in.

38:33.061 --> 38:34.521
He touched his nose.

38:34.521 --> 38:36.440
I did not.

38:36.440 --> 38:39.151
I'm not wearing that.
- I will pay you an extra ten.

38:39.151 --> 38:40.569
That's embarrassing.

38:40.569 --> 38:41.987
Oh, what you got on now
is a step-up?

38:41.987 --> 38:44.322
Susie.
- What are you doing here?

38:44.322 --> 38:45.699
What happened to being
on the show?

38:45.699 --> 38:47.159
It's not happening.
That's what happened.

38:47.159 --> 38:48.910
Can I have my jumpsuit, please?

38:48.910 --> 38:51.872
- I don't understand.
- A writer can't be
on the show, ever.

38:51.872 --> 38:54.124
The fuck are you talking about?
You can go.

38:54.124 --> 38:56.418
Fine. Here.

38:56.418 --> 38:58.045
It's a rule. Never broken.

38:58.045 --> 39:00.380
I will never appear
on <i>The Gordon Ford Show.</i>

39:00.380 --> 39:02.549
- Fuck!
- A good "fuck" or a bad "fuck"?

39:02.549 --> 39:05.177
- That is a flat-out bad "fuck."
- I second that "fuck,"

39:05.177 --> 39:07.554
and I'll raise you
two "shits" and a "cocksucker."

39:07.554 --> 39:09.973
- It's a stupid-ass rule!
- Yes, it is.

39:09.973 --> 39:13.018
Okay. I'm gonna go get this
over with, if you don't mind.

39:13.018 --> 39:14.853
Mommy! Mommy!

39:16.063 --> 39:17.856
Ethan. Hi, baby.

39:17.856 --> 39:19.483
We're here to see the show.

39:19.483 --> 39:21.735
- How did you know
about the show?
- You invited us.

39:21.735 --> 39:24.571
Oh, shit, that's right.
We almost
didn't make it.

39:24.571 --> 39:25.989
Esther suddenly decided
she was sick of hearing

39:25.989 --> 39:28.200
- the voices of our family.
- Wow.

39:28.200 --> 39:30.744
I had to bribe her with ice
cream and a trip to FAO Schwarz.

39:30.744 --> 39:32.746
She's a genius.

39:32.746 --> 39:34.915
You okay?
- Yes. I'm fine.

39:34.915 --> 39:37.125
- You remembered
we were coming, right?
- I did.

39:37.125 --> 39:38.919
Just as soon as you got here.

39:38.919 --> 39:40.170
- You want us to go?
- No.

39:40.170 --> 39:42.297
No. Stay, enjoy the show.

39:42.297 --> 39:45.050
I just had a bad day,
that's all.

39:45.050 --> 39:46.343
Why? Problems at work?

39:46.343 --> 39:48.512
- Well...
- Ah! Too much talking!

39:48.512 --> 39:50.806
Boy, are you
in the wrong family, kid.

39:50.806 --> 39:52.933
Okay. There's hot dogs
around somewhere.

39:52.933 --> 39:55.268
Just stuff their faces.
I'll see you after.

39:56.436 --> 39:57.938
Hey.

39:59.231 --> 40:01.233
Just...

40:01.233 --> 40:03.777
some days are harder
than others, you know?

40:03.777 --> 40:06.029
Yeah. I know.

40:10.575 --> 40:12.953
Daddy! Daddy!
- Hey, Esther.

40:12.953 --> 40:14.412
The public
has spoken.

40:14.412 --> 40:15.705
- Hey. Hey. Sorry. Sorry.
- Private Waste Management:

40:15.705 --> 40:17.082
A Musical Journey in Three Acts

40:17.082 --> 40:19.376
- <i>is a hit.</i>
- That looks good.
- Yeah.

40:19.376 --> 40:21.711
<i>Catch it now on the main stage.</i>

40:24.673 --> 40:26.925
Ah, ah, ah.

40:28.969 --> 40:31.138
Now I lay me
down to sleep,

40:31.138 --> 40:33.223
I pray the Lord my soul to keep.

40:33.223 --> 40:35.976
Please bless Mommy and Daddy
and my little brother...

40:42.065 --> 40:43.483
And, mostly, God,
please bless...

40:43.483 --> 40:45.861
Christ. Hot in there.

40:48.822 --> 40:50.115
Go on.

40:51.158 --> 40:53.243
Please bless
New York City,

40:53.243 --> 40:55.579
the greatest city
in the whole wide world.

40:55.579 --> 40:58.415
I sure am lucky I live here. Amen.

40:59.708 --> 41:02.252
This kid's gonna spend
the next ten years

41:02.252 --> 41:04.629
- stuffed in a locker.
- Hey, guys, he's asleep.

41:51.384 --> 41:53.178
You'd never know
that just last night,

41:53.178 --> 41:56.181
there was a mound of trash
as high as an elephant's eye.

41:56.181 --> 41:58.516
High enough that
the Von Trapp Family Singers

41:58.516 --> 42:00.393
could climb over it
to escape the Nazis.

42:01.478 --> 42:03.230
That's pretty high.

42:03.230 --> 42:04.731
But now look at it. Gone.

42:04.731 --> 42:06.942
Now all you see are
sidewalks so clean

42:06.942 --> 42:08.401
you could eat off them.

42:08.401 --> 42:11.321
Streets so gleaming
you could see your reflection.

42:11.321 --> 42:15.617
Hmm, looks like
I need a shave.

42:15.617 --> 42:17.869
Ah, that joke has found
its demographic.

42:17.869 --> 42:20.288
What the fuck?
Extra! Extra!

42:20.288 --> 42:21.623
There's the paperboy.

42:21.623 --> 42:23.625
He delivers, well, papers,

42:23.625 --> 42:25.418
which become trash, ironically.

42:25.418 --> 42:27.963
There's a mother
with her babies.

42:27.963 --> 42:29.798
A guy with a briefcase
who's the father

42:29.798 --> 42:31.758
of at least one of those babies.

42:31.758 --> 42:33.510
Apparently, the one thing
these people haven't thrown away

42:33.510 --> 42:34.636
is the amphetamines.

42:34.636 --> 42:37.097
It's not?
- What?

42:37.097 --> 42:39.057
Oh, right. Wait. Okay.

42:39.057 --> 42:40.684
Here I am, okay.

42:40.684 --> 42:42.269
You haven't missed much,
trust me.

42:42.269 --> 42:44.271
No, little boy, it's not.

42:44.271 --> 42:46.940
The city only disposes of a
small amount of the actual trash

42:46.940 --> 42:49.150
that is thrown away,
the easy stuff.

42:49.150 --> 42:52.320
But we live in a big city.
We have big city trash.

42:52.320 --> 42:53.989
See where I'm going with this?

42:53.989 --> 42:56.700
What is private demolition
and waste management?

42:56.700 --> 42:58.326

Hey, what the hell's

43:42.078 --> 43:44.289
- What? It's the trash show.
- No, it's not.

43:44.289 --> 43:46.833
- She's fucking around up there.
- And she's still not off-book.

43:46.833 --> 43:49.294
- What do you want from me?
- I want what was promised.

43:49.294 --> 43:50.545
She's up there.
She's in the suit.

43:50.545 --> 43:52.672
From the beginning,
she's been a problem.

43:52.672 --> 43:53.798
She wouldn't
use the cigar.

43:53.798 --> 43:55.050
Nobody's missing the cigar.

43:55.050 --> 43:56.551
- I asked you for a favor.
- I know.

43:56.551 --> 43:58.678
And I thought you were taking
that favor seriously.

43:58.678 --> 44:00.013
I did take it seriously.

44:00.013 --> 44:02.098
Does this look like
serious to you?

44:02.098 --> 44:03.850
Is this a bad time
to ask where his mother is?

44:03.850 --> 44:05.935
That looks like
a temper tantrum,

44:05.935 --> 44:08.188
and I don't like
temper tantrums.

44:08.188 --> 44:10.231
Listen to me, the next time
I ask you for a favor...

44:10.231 --> 44:12.776
- Next time?
- Yeah, next time.

44:12.776 --> 44:14.778
This was the favor, Frank.

44:14.778 --> 44:16.738
What the fuck
are you talking about?

44:16.738 --> 44:18.281
We reciprocated. This was it.

44:18.281 --> 44:21.242
- It? It?
- There is no "it," Susie.

44:21.242 --> 44:22.494
We own you.

44:22.494 --> 44:24.454
Thirty percent of
everything you do,

44:24.454 --> 44:26.623
everything you touch,
everything she touches.

44:26.623 --> 44:27.957
That's the deal.

44:27.957 --> 44:30.293
Yeah, but that was
before we agreed to do this.

44:30.293 --> 44:32.670
Oh, Susie, I think you have
a problem understanding things.

44:32.670 --> 44:35.256
No, I don't. This was
supposed to make us square.

44:35.256 --> 44:36.633
There is no making us square.

44:36.633 --> 44:39.052
This is it.
This is the situation.

44:39.052 --> 44:40.595
Mismanaged waste
kills up to...

44:40.595 --> 44:41.888
For how long?

44:41.888 --> 44:44.808
For as long as you are
Susie fucking Myerson!

44:44.808 --> 44:48.395
Now you get your head straight,
and you get her head straight.

44:48.395 --> 44:50.313
And don't you ever fuck

44:50.313 --> 44:53.274
with a musical production
of ours again.

44:53.274 --> 44:56.611
Next time,
there's gonna be tech.

44:56.611 --> 44:58.446
...parasitic illness.

44:58.446 --> 45:00.615
Yeah, I guess while he mourns
his little cartwheeler,

45:00.615 --> 45:01.991
I'm supposed to
tell you now about

45:01.991 --> 45:03.827
all the ways
that trash can kill you.

45:03.827 --> 45:05.412
<i>Bye Bye Birdie</i> it ain't.

45:05.412 --> 45:06.871
What's going on here?

45:06.871 --> 45:08.832
It's a trade show.
Go buy some tires, hmm?

45:08.832 --> 45:11.000
Why is Midge giving up onstage?
She never gives up onstage.

45:11.000 --> 45:13.211
I don't know, Joel.
It's an off night.

45:13.211 --> 45:15.713
- Ask for your money back.
- Who are those guys, Susie?

45:15.713 --> 45:17.173
- They're no one.
- They don't look like no one.

45:17.173 --> 45:19.509
- Well, they are.
- Did you piss them off?

45:19.509 --> 45:21.094
Leave me alone.

45:21.094 --> 45:22.679
What did you do?

45:22.679 --> 45:24.097
Why are they threatening you?

45:24.097 --> 45:25.473
Why are they looking at Midge
like she's got

45:25.473 --> 45:26.683
a fucking lot number on her ass?

45:26.683 --> 45:27.809
I don't know
what you're talking about.

45:27.809 --> 45:29.227
Did you get her mixed up
in something?

45:29.227 --> 45:31.229
What's happening, "manager"?
You mobbed up?

45:31.229 --> 45:32.355
- No.
- No?

45:32.355 --> 45:33.440
This whole place looks like

45:33.440 --> 45:34.649
part two of
the Apalachin meeting.

45:34.649 --> 45:36.860
- I got to go.
- Hey. Look at me.

45:37.902 --> 45:39.779
- Do you have a handle on this?
- Yes.

45:39.779 --> 45:41.489
- Do you need help?
- No.

45:41.489 --> 45:43.575
How deep is my wife
in this shit you got going here?

45:43.575 --> 45:46.244
- Just go babysit, Joel, okay?
- Fuck you.

45:46.244 --> 45:47.996
You're not cute just 'cause
you're four feet tall

45:47.996 --> 45:49.622
and you dress like
a Katzenjammer Kid.

45:49.622 --> 45:51.332
I want to know what you're into.

45:51.332 --> 45:53.710
Okay, well,
thanks for stopping by.

45:53.710 --> 45:55.420
I'm gonna find out, Susie.

45:55.420 --> 45:57.297
I'm gonna get to the bottom
of whatever it is

45:57.297 --> 45:59.174
you have once again fucked up,
you hear me?

46:36.669 --> 46:40.131
And we're back from commercial
in three, two...

46:47.305 --> 46:49.766
Welcome back, folks,
and yes, we are still here

46:49.766 --> 46:51.684
with my guest Hart Buckley
of the Bronx Zoo,

46:51.684 --> 46:53.728
and I just can't believe my luck

46:53.728 --> 46:56.731
but he has yet one more
adorable critter for us to meet,

46:56.731 --> 46:58.149
so let's...
Excuse me, sir.

46:58.149 --> 47:00.026
Is this the ladies' room?

47:03.446 --> 47:05.740
Well, what do you know,
Sophie Lennon.

47:07.242 --> 47:09.077
Boy, are you
a sight for sore eyes.

47:09.077 --> 47:10.578
- Mwah.
- Mm, careful, Gordon.

47:10.578 --> 47:12.205
That's how
my fifth marriage started.

47:12.205 --> 47:14.874
And my fourth one ended.

47:23.091 --> 47:25.885
Well, that sure was
a nice greeting.

47:25.885 --> 47:27.845
Hello.

47:27.845 --> 47:30.890
I think I wore your brother
to Delmonico's last night.

47:30.890 --> 47:33.309
Oh, we are delighted
to see you, Sophie.

47:33.309 --> 47:35.895
- Hey, would you like a termite?
- Maybe later.

47:35.895 --> 47:37.855
Sophie Lennon,
as you all know, folks,

47:37.855 --> 47:39.816
hosts the hit game show
<i>Seconds Count.</i>

47:39.816 --> 47:42.110
Thank you.

47:42.110 --> 47:44.445
It is a hit, isn't it?

47:44.445 --> 47:46.489
Now, correct me if I'm wrong,
but isn't your studio

47:46.489 --> 47:48.449
- right down the hall?
- I think it is.

47:48.449 --> 47:50.910
And yet, I believe this is the
first time you've come to visit.

47:50.910 --> 47:53.496
- Is that right?
- Now, not to be
too much a braggart,

47:53.496 --> 47:54.789
but I feel we've been

47:54.789 --> 47:56.457
a good friend to you
at <i>The Gordon Ford Show.</i>

47:56.457 --> 47:59.085
- Maybe helped you
get that hit show.
- You did, Gordon.

47:59.085 --> 48:02.589
I was at my lowest point,
and you gave me a leg up.

48:02.589 --> 48:04.007
So, what happened?

48:04.007 --> 48:06.217
Well, you know me,
once I've got my legs up...

48:09.554 --> 48:11.431
Heel, Sophie, heel.

48:11.431 --> 48:13.182
Hey. We need talk.

48:13.182 --> 48:14.684
What in
the ever-loving fuck?

48:14.684 --> 48:16.644
Why didn't you tell
me about this bullshit rule?

48:16.644 --> 48:18.438
- What?
- No one who works on the show

48:18.438 --> 48:19.897
can be on the show,
is that right?

48:19.897 --> 48:21.399
Yeah. So?

48:21.399 --> 48:23.359
So, why didn't you tell me that
when you hired her?

48:23.359 --> 48:25.903
- I didn't fucking hire her.
- No excuse.

48:25.903 --> 48:27.572
Little excuse.

48:27.572 --> 48:29.240
- You need to fix this.
- I need to...

48:29.240 --> 48:31.618
There is
a goddamn show going on.

48:31.618 --> 48:35.788
- Well, fix it after.
- I am not gonna fix anything.

48:35.788 --> 48:37.290
It's a bullshit rule.

48:37.290 --> 48:39.876
It's Gordon's rule. Talk to him.

48:39.876 --> 48:41.544
Fuck.

48:57.769 --> 48:58.978
Susan?

49:02.190 --> 49:03.983
Susan!

49:05.943 --> 49:07.987
Susan, they just
waxed the floors.

49:07.987 --> 49:09.656
Susan!

49:09.656 --> 49:10.907
I will catch up with you.

49:10.907 --> 49:12.533
Don't forget I played lacrosse.

49:12.533 --> 49:14.327
Susan! Damn it.

49:14.327 --> 49:16.913
Could you not? I'm in... Oh!

49:16.913 --> 49:18.748
This is a ridiculous waste
of stockings.

49:18.748 --> 49:21.709
Stop. I mean,
you're going to lose.

49:21.709 --> 49:23.920
You know, this is just like
that party we went to

49:23.920 --> 49:25.922
where you were supposed to dress
up as the woman you admire most,

49:25.922 --> 49:27.173
and you came as Lady Macbeth,

49:27.173 --> 49:28.591
and we got
in that terrible fight.

49:28.591 --> 49:31.636
You left and ran away,
and I caught you then, too.

49:31.636 --> 49:33.262
Oh, no,
you went through a glass door.

49:33.262 --> 49:35.598
How will I ever find you?

49:38.267 --> 49:40.228
You can't not talk to me.

49:40.228 --> 49:41.896
There's a reason
we ran into each other.

49:41.896 --> 49:43.564
The universe is
telling us something.

49:43.564 --> 49:44.816
No, it isn't.

49:44.816 --> 49:47.318
And this is nothing like
that night or that party.

49:47.318 --> 49:49.153
And you were on
the lacrosse team for two hours,

49:49.153 --> 49:51.197
- and then you got bored.
- Lacrosse is boring.

49:51.197 --> 49:52.740
I know it's boring.

49:52.740 --> 49:54.826
I told you it was boring
and you shouldn't join,

49:54.826 --> 49:57.120
and then you joined
because I told you not to join.

49:57.120 --> 49:58.830
How fucked-up is that?

49:58.830 --> 50:00.957
Jesus Christ. Don't you have
a gala to go to or something?

50:00.957 --> 50:02.583
Nope. Today's my day of rest.

50:02.583 --> 50:04.836
Wow, Susan Myerson.

50:04.836 --> 50:06.796
I can't believe
I'm talking to you. It's been...

50:06.796 --> 50:09.674
Do not stand there and pretend
this is a touching reunion.

50:09.674 --> 50:11.134
- I got to go.
- Why?

50:11.134 --> 50:13.761
I have work. I have a life.

50:13.761 --> 50:15.388
Just because you lose
interest in something,

50:15.388 --> 50:17.181
- it doesn't just go away.
- I know.

50:17.181 --> 50:19.183
There was still lacrosse
after you quit.

50:19.183 --> 50:21.102
Well, there shouldn't have been.

50:21.102 --> 50:23.688
Please, just...

50:23.688 --> 50:25.148
It's been so long.

50:27.233 --> 50:28.860
You look really good.

50:29.986 --> 50:31.446
You do.

50:31.446 --> 50:33.281
Yeah, I love the hat.

50:34.699 --> 50:36.576
Mrs. Gordon Ford?

50:36.576 --> 50:38.578
Yeah.

50:38.578 --> 50:40.580
It's quite an accomplishment.

50:40.580 --> 50:43.374
- That's not all I am.
- Yeah, that's all you are.

50:43.374 --> 50:46.127
It's all you are to me,
Mrs. Fucking Gordon Ford.

50:47.628 --> 50:48.796
How are you?

50:48.796 --> 50:50.173
Oh, you better pick
a different question.

50:50.173 --> 50:52.550
Oh, Susie, can we take this
down just a hair?

50:52.550 --> 50:55.636
I didn't tell you to follow me.
I didn't want to talk to you.

50:55.636 --> 50:58.139
Hey, let's get a drink.

50:58.139 --> 51:01.517
Let's find a bar and get soused,
and you can say everything to me

51:01.517 --> 51:02.977
you've wanted to say
for 15 years.

51:02.977 --> 51:05.104
I don't want to say
anything to you.

51:05.104 --> 51:06.606
Fine, then you can ask me

51:06.606 --> 51:08.441
anything you wanted to ask me
for 15 years.

51:08.441 --> 51:10.818
No. Everything you say
is bullshit anyhow.

51:11.944 --> 51:13.821
I guess I understand
why you feel like this.

51:13.821 --> 51:16.491
Well, I don't give a fuck
if you understand or not.

51:16.491 --> 51:18.451
This is public. It's too loud.

51:18.451 --> 51:19.660
I'm loud!

51:19.660 --> 51:21.037
I was loud then, I'm loud now.

51:21.037 --> 51:22.580
This isn't new.

51:22.580 --> 51:24.123
Please, let's sit and drink.

51:25.500 --> 51:27.084
I can't cover everything

51:27.084 --> 51:28.753
right here on the street
like this.

51:28.753 --> 51:30.630
- No.
- Please, let's talk.

51:30.630 --> 51:33.132
I... Let me find out about you.

51:33.132 --> 51:35.802
I'm the same.
I am what I always was. You?

51:35.802 --> 51:37.470
- Well, let me...
- What?

51:37.470 --> 51:39.263
Explain? Apologize?

51:39.263 --> 51:40.723
Apologize for what?

51:40.723 --> 51:42.725
For what?

51:42.725 --> 51:45.478
For, I don't know,
making plans and promises and...

51:45.478 --> 51:47.146
I never made promises.

51:47.146 --> 51:49.148
- You're kidding.
- I was 22.

51:49.148 --> 51:51.359
What promises
can you make at 22?

51:51.359 --> 51:53.486
- Plenty!
- We're grown-ups.

51:53.486 --> 51:54.737
Can't we be grown-ups?

51:54.737 --> 51:56.531
Can't we talk like grown women?

51:56.531 --> 51:57.907
I don't know
what grown women talk like.

51:57.907 --> 51:59.367
I deal with comics.

51:59.367 --> 52:01.369
Okay.

52:01.369 --> 52:03.037
I'll apologize
if you want me to.

52:03.037 --> 52:05.873
Oh, will you? What a sport.

52:05.873 --> 52:07.124
What a fucking peach.

52:07.124 --> 52:08.584
I don't want an apology.

52:08.584 --> 52:10.878
I don't want anything from you.

52:10.878 --> 52:13.589
I swear,
I didn't mean to hurt you.

52:13.589 --> 52:15.007
It was college.

52:15.007 --> 52:18.094
I was a redhead.
That was a mistake, too.

52:18.094 --> 52:19.595
No.

52:20.763 --> 52:22.723
I didn't...

52:24.058 --> 52:26.769
You were definitely not...

52:28.771 --> 52:31.899
Oh, boy, I really want
to buy you that drink.

52:31.899 --> 52:34.068
I have to go.

52:34.068 --> 52:36.529
Nice to see you, Hedy.

52:36.529 --> 52:38.447
