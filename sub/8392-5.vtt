WEBVTT

00:01.550 --> 00:02.881
- YOU WANNA KNOW WHY I SAID NO?
I WANT A CLOSED ADOPTION.

00:03.000 --> 00:04.308
- I THINK YOU HAVE A CRUSH
ON DR. JOE,

00:04.410 --> 00:06.093
AND I THINK DR. JOE
HAS A CRUSH ON YOU.

00:06.210 --> 00:07.962
- THIS GUY IS
A SON OF A BITCH.

00:08.070 --> 00:09.298
- HE WAS THE LOVE
OF MY LIFE,

00:09.420 --> 00:11.274
BUT HE'S SICK NOW,
AND I KNOW THAT NOW!

00:11.390 --> 00:12.721
- I HAVE RELATIONSHIPS
WITH BANDS.

00:12.840 --> 00:14.216
IF I STARTED MY OWN STUDIO,

00:14.320 --> 00:15.719
THEY WOULD ALL FOLLOW ME OVER
IN A SECOND.

00:15.840 --> 00:16.738
- DO YOU HAVE THAT
IN WRITING?

00:16.840 --> 00:18.046
- I HAVE IT IN FIST BUMPS.

00:18.150 --> 00:19.139
- I THINK I MIGHT WANNA
DO THIS WITH YOU.

00:19.260 --> 00:20.113
- TO THE LUNCHEONETI'E.
- I'M WORRIED.

00:20.220 --> 00:22.905
ALL I'M ASKING YOU
IS TO NOT SCREW UP.

00:23.020 --> 00:24.248
- HOW DID THIS
WHOLE THING START?

00:24.360 --> 00:26.248
- MAX TOLD JABBAR
THAT THEY HAD

00:26.370 --> 00:27.530
TO EAT LUNCH TOGETHER
EVERY DAY.

00:27.640 --> 00:29.198
- I THOUGHT THAT THEY WANTED
TO EAT TOGETHER.

00:29.300 --> 00:31.985
- NOT ALL THE TIME.

00:32.100 --> 00:34.261
- SO I DON'T GET LUNCH?

00:34.370 --> 00:36.440
- NO, HONEY, YOU GET LUNCH.

00:36.550 --> 00:38.643
YOU JUST--YOU HAVE TO EAT
IN A CLASSROOM.

00:38.760 --> 00:39.829
THAT'S ALL.

00:39.930 --> 00:42.239
- I'LL BE ALONE?

00:42.350 --> 00:44.932
- YEAH, BUT IT'S JUST ONE WEEK
DURING LUNCH.

00:45.040 --> 00:47.270
ONE WEEK LUNCH DETENTION,
THEN IT'S OVER.

00:47.390 --> 00:49.176
- YEAH, AND THEY ALSO
WANT YOU TO WRITE

00:49.290 --> 00:51.929
A LETTER OF APOLOGY
TO JABBAR.

00:52.050 --> 00:53.904
JUST A QUICK LETI'ER.

00:54.010 --> 00:56.399
- WHAT'S JABBAR'S PUNISHMENT?

00:56.500 --> 01:00.322
- I--I THINK HE MIGHT HAVE
A DIFFERENT PUNISHMENT THAN YOU.

01:00.430 --> 01:01.943
- SO HE DOESN'T
GET DETENTION?

01:02.060 --> 01:03.914
- NO.
- NO, I--

01:04.020 --> 01:05.362
- DOES HE HAVE
TO WRITE ME A LETTER?

01:05.470 --> 01:08.473
- NO, HONEY, HE DOESN'T HAVE
TO WRITE YOU A LETTER.

01:08.580 --> 01:09.308
- HE HIT ME FIRST.

01:09.410 --> 01:11.059
- MAX, I KNOW
IT DOESN'T MAKE SENSE,

01:11.170 --> 01:12.205
BUT THE REASON THAT
THEY'RE DOING THIS

01:12.310 --> 01:13.618
IS BECAUSE YOU'RE
IN THE FIFTH GRADE.

01:13.720 --> 01:14.789
HE'S IN THE SECOND GRADE,

01:14.900 --> 01:16.276
AND THEY WANT YOU,
THE OLDER KID,

01:16.380 --> 01:17.369
TO SET A GOOD EXAMPLE.

01:17.490 --> 01:19.037
- YOU'RE OLDER,
AND THAT'S THE REASON.

01:19.140 --> 01:21.381
- IT'S NOT FAIR!
THIS ISN'T FAIR!

01:21.490 --> 01:24.141
HE HIT ME FIRST, AND THEN
I GET LUNCH DETENTION?

01:24.250 --> 01:25.797
WHAT GENIUS
THOUGHT THAT UP?

01:25.910 --> 01:27.491
- YOU'RE RIGHT
TO BE ANGRY, OKAY?

01:27.600 --> 01:29.079
SOMETIMES IN LIFE
THINGS HAPPEN,

01:29.190 --> 01:30.589
AND YOU JUST--
THIS IS ONE OF THOSE THINGS

01:30.710 --> 01:32.496
WHERE YOU JUST GO'I'I'A
SUCK IT UP AND DO IT.

01:32.600 --> 01:34.295
- SUCK WHAT UP?
- AH, IT'S JUST AN EXPRESSION.

01:34.400 --> 01:35.116
- DON'T USE EXPRESSIONS.

01:35.230 --> 01:37.437
YOU KNOW I HATE EXPRESSIONS.

01:37.540 --> 01:40.054
- OKAY, JUST--IT MEANS IT'S
SOMETHING YOU HAVE TO DO

01:40.160 --> 01:41.673
WHETHER YOU LIKE IT OR NOT.

01:41.790 --> 01:43.951
YOU JUST HAVE TO DO IT.
- IT'S JUST A WEEK.

01:44.060 --> 01:47.097
HONEY, WE'RE SORRY.
WE'RE SO SORRY.

01:47.210 --> 01:50.304
[Max sobs]

01:50.420 --> 01:51.580
- MAX.

01:51.690 --> 01:52.725
BUDDY, HEY.

01:52.830 --> 01:54.411
- IT'S OKAY.

01:54.520 --> 01:58.411
- [sobs]

02:01.500 --> 02:02.979
- NOW, LOOK,
I KNOW A LOT OF GUYS

02:03.080 --> 02:05.014
WOULD HAVE VALETED
ON A FIRST DATE.

02:05.120 --> 02:07.668
BUT I'M NOT GONNA PASS UP
A SPOT LIKE THAT.

02:07.780 --> 02:10.010
AND I JUST SAVED SIX BUCKS.
PRETTY GOOD, HUH?

02:10.130 --> 02:12.121
AND WHEN ALL THE OTHER IDIOTS
ARE WAITING FOR THEIR CAR,

02:12.230 --> 02:14.334
WE'RE JUST GONNA ZIP OUT,
FAST GETAWAY.

02:14.440 --> 02:17.364
- YOU ARE SO FINANCIALLY
RESPONSIBLE AND SMART.

02:17.480 --> 02:19.300
- THANK YOU.
WELL, I TRY.

02:19.410 --> 02:20.957
I THINK THAT'S A GOOD QUALITY
OF MINE ACTUALLY.

02:21.070 --> 02:22.094
- I THINK IT'S A GREAT QUALITY.

02:22.210 --> 02:23.609
- HEY.

02:23.720 --> 02:24.721

02:27.900 --> 02:29.242

- HI, I'M TUF.

02:31.250 --> 02:32.103

02:50.750 --> 02:51.956
YEAH.

02:52.060 --> 02:53.163
- THANKS.
- VOILA.

02:53.270 --> 02:55.579
- YEAH.

02:58.830 --> 03:01.583
- HE DOESN'T SAY,
"I KNEW IT WAS YOU."

03:01.690 --> 03:04.318
HE SAYS,
"I KNOW IT WAS YOU, FREDO."

03:04.420 --> 03:06.035
- WELL, THEN HE SHOULD
HAVE SAID,

03:06.150 --> 03:08.357
"AND YOU ARE
BREAKING MY HEART."

03:08.460 --> 03:10.906
- OH, MY GOD, I CAN'T BELIEVE
YOU'RE GETTING IT WRONG.

03:11.010 --> 03:13.490
HE SAYS,
"I KNOW IT WAS YOU, FREDO.

03:13.600 --> 03:16.046
YOU BROKE MY HEART.
YOU BROKE MY HEART."

03:16.160 --> 03:17.252
- AND HOLDS--
HE GOES LIKE THIS--

03:17.360 --> 03:21.194
- HELLO, YOU TWO.

03:30.690 --> 03:32.271
HI.

I'M HANGING OUT IN TOWN.

03:36.070 --> 03:37.276
- BACK IN TOWN, HUH?

03:37.380 --> 03:39.348
- WANTED TO HANG, YOU KNOW,

03:39.460 --> 03:42.486
GET THE MUSIC OUT
AND PLAY GUITARS

03:42.600 --> 03:44.761
AND JUST, YOU KNOW,
HANG OUT AND SING.

03:44.870 --> 03:46.451
YOU GOT A GUITAR IN THERE?

03:46.570 --> 03:48.140

03:51.470 --> 03:52.494
- COME HERE.
COME OVER HERE AND TALK TO ME.

03:52.610 --> 03:54.009
- I HAD A DRINK.
- I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU'RE DRUNK.

03:54.130 --> 03:55.324
- I HAD ONE DRINK.

03:55.440 --> 03:56.600
- WHAT HAPPENED, SETH?
WHAT HAPPENED?

03:56.710 --> 03:59.190

03:59.300 --> 04:02.167
- WELL, THEY FIRED ME,
BUT THEN I QUIT.

04:02.270 --> 04:03.407

HEY, CAPTAIN, I TOLD YOU

04:09.450 --> 04:10.826

06:40.020 --> 06:43.945
- UM, I'VE JUST HAD A CRAMP
FOR THE LAST COUPLE OF HOURS.

06:44.050 --> 06:45.153
- COUPLE HOURS STRAIGHT?

06:45.260 --> 06:47.012
- LIKE EVERY TEN MINUTES.

06:47.130 --> 06:47.778
- HOW LONG DOES IT LAST?

06:47.890 --> 06:49.505
- FOR, LIKE, TWO MINUTES.

06:49.610 --> 06:51.225

- OKAY.

06:58.240 --> 07:01.858
[exhales deeply]

07:01.970 --> 07:02.925
- OKAY, WE'RE GOING
TO THE HOSPITAL.

07:03.040 --> 07:04.792
- I CAN'T--
I CAN'T GO TO THE HOSPITAL.

07:04.900 --> 07:06.128
I'M NOT GOING
TO THE HOSPITAL.

07:06.250 --> 07:07.342
I'LL GET FIRED.

07:07.460 --> 07:09.416
- YOU CAN'T GET FIRED
FOR THIS.

07:09.530 --> 07:12.044
AND YOU ARE DEFINITELY
GOING TO THE HOSPITAL.

07:17.220 --> 07:19.984
- HELLO?

07:20.090 --> 07:21.773

07:28.930 --> 07:30.374

07:30.480 --> 07:31.959
- HANG ON, LET ME--
- OH, HEY.

07:32.070 --> 07:33.059
- HEY.

07:33.170 --> 07:34.512

07:34.620 --> 07:35.996
- NO, NO, I JUST--
I JUST GOT UP.

07:36.110 --> 07:37.680
- CAN I COME IN FOR A SECOND?
- YES, OF COURSE.

07:37.800 --> 07:38.824
- I WAS GONNA CALL YOU,

07:38.940 --> 07:40.896
AND THEN I THOUGHT, WELL,
I'LL JUST COME OVER

07:41.010 --> 07:42.409
AND SAY HELLO.

07:42.530 --> 07:43.519
I HAVEN'T SEEN
THIS PLACE YET.

07:43.630 --> 07:44.938
IT'S BEAUTIFUL.
VERY COOL.

07:45.050 --> 07:46.176
VERY, VERY COOL
FIRST APARTMENT.

07:46.290 --> 07:47.382

07:47.500 --> 07:49.218

A LITTLE--

07:49.330 --> 07:50.558
SORT OF A WEIRD FAVOR.

07:50.670 --> 07:52.114
- ARE YOU OKAY?
DO YOU WANNA SIT DOWN?

07:52.230 --> 07:53.913
YOU SHOULD SIT.
- YEAH, JUST FOR A SECOND.

07:54.020 --> 07:54.918
- HERE.

07:55.020 --> 07:56.908
PLEASE.

07:59.340 --> 08:00.841
LET ME SEE IF I CAN--
CLEAN GLASS.

08:00.960 --> 08:02.882
- AMBER, YOU KNOW
THE THING THAT HAPPENED

08:02.990 --> 08:04.855
WITH MAX AND JABBAR
AT SCHOOL?

08:04.960 --> 08:07.019
- YES.
- THEY GOT INTO A BIG FIGHT.

08:07.140 --> 08:10.610
AND NOW HIS DETENTION
IS THAT HE HAS TO SPEND

08:10.730 --> 08:14.109
AN HOUR ALONE FOR THIS WEEK

08:14.210 --> 08:15.199
AT LUNCHTIME BY HIMSELF.

08:15.320 --> 08:17.140
- THAT'S EXTREME.

08:17.250 --> 08:19.457
- I WAS WONDERING MAYBE
IF YOU COULD JUST GO

08:19.560 --> 08:21.972
AND JUST SIT WITH HIM
FOR AN HOUR?

08:22.080 --> 08:24.184
- SIT IN--SIT WITH HIM IN--
- HIS CLASSROOM.

08:24.290 --> 08:25.518
- IN HIS CLASSROOM.

08:25.640 --> 08:26.709
- I ALREADY CLEARED IT
WITH SCHOOL,

08:26.810 --> 08:27.947
AND THEY SAID
IT WOULD BE FINE.

08:28.050 --> 08:30.052
AND JUST TO MAKE HIM
FEEL COMFORTABLE,

08:30.160 --> 08:31.707
BECAUSE I CAN'T BE THERE.

08:31.820 --> 08:33.674
- I'M JUST--
I'M NERVOUS BECAUSE

08:33.780 --> 08:35.122
I HAVEN'T SPENT
AS MUCH TIME WITH HIM.

08:35.230 --> 08:36.640
I DON'T KNOW HIM AS WELL.

08:36.750 --> 08:38.433
I MEAN, I'M NOT EVEN SURE
HE'D BE COMFORTABLE

08:38.550 --> 08:39.574
WITH ME BEING THERE.

08:39.690 --> 08:41.089
AM I REALLY EQUIPPED TO--
- YOU ARE.

08:41.210 --> 08:42.757
YOU'RE FAMILY.

08:42.860 --> 08:44.828
AND BASICALLY I DON'T HAVE
ANY OTHER OPTIONS RIGHT NOW.

08:44.930 --> 08:46.101
SO IF YOU CAN HELP ME
WITH THIS--

08:46.210 --> 08:47.199
- THERE IT IS.

08:47.310 --> 08:49.244
- NO, AMBER, I SWEAR,
I WOULD ASK YOU ANYWAY, BUT--

08:49.350 --> 08:51.079
- PLEASE,
I'M NOT OFFENDED.

08:51.180 --> 08:53.933
- SO, UM, HE HAS TO WRITE
A LETTER OF APOLOGY TO JABBAR.

08:54.050 --> 08:55.836
- RIGHT.
- AND HE DOESN'T WANT TO DO IT.

08:55.940 --> 08:57.567
HE'S GONNA BE
REALLY DEFIANT ABOUT IT

08:57.670 --> 08:59.638
AND KIND OF, I DON'T KNOW,
STANDOFFISH,

08:59.740 --> 09:01.150
BUT I REALLY
NEED YOU TO PERSIST AND--

09:01.260 --> 09:03.672
AND GET THROUGH TO HIM.

09:03.780 --> 09:04.940
- OF COURSE.
- YOU'LL DO IT?

09:05.060 --> 09:06.539
- OF COURSE.
IT'LL BE FUN.

09:06.640 --> 09:08.221
- TODAY AT NOON.

09:08.340 --> 09:09.887
- TODAY AT NOON, OKAY.

09:09.990 --> 09:10.718
- I LOVE YOU.

09:10.820 --> 09:11.741
- LOVE YOU TOO.

09:11.860 --> 09:13.168
- YOU HAVE A GOOD DAY,

09:13.270 --> 09:14.259
AND CALL ME FOR ANYTHING.

09:14.380 --> 09:15.927
AND JUST BE PERSISTENT
WITH HIM.

09:16.030 --> 09:17.133
OKAY, PERSIST.

09:17.240 --> 09:18.343
- PERSIST.

09:18.450 --> 09:20.202
- OKAY. BYE.

09:22.830 --> 09:23.865
- I ASKED HER POINT BLANK,

09:23.970 --> 09:26.109
"WHAT IF THIS DR. JOE
ASKED YOU ON A DATE?"

09:26.220 --> 09:28.211
- YEAH.
- WANTED TO GO OUT FOR DINNER?

09:28.320 --> 09:29.901
SHE SAID, "NO WAY."
- RIGHT.

09:30.010 --> 09:31.523
- AND WHERE WOULD
I RUN INTO HER?

09:31.640 --> 09:32.732
AT A PLACE WHERE
THEY JUST HAD DINNER.

09:32.840 --> 09:34.182
- REALLY?
- ON A DATE.

09:34.290 --> 09:35.666
- HUH.
- TEXTBOOK DATE.

09:35.780 --> 09:37.634
I MEAN, HOW UNPROFESSIONAL
IS THIS GUY?

09:37.740 --> 09:39.014
- YOU KNOW WHAT
THAT SOUNDS LIKE?

09:39.130 --> 09:40.984
- HE'S DATING HIS PATIENTS?
THAT'S WHERE HE'S PULLING FROM?

09:41.090 --> 09:42.842
- THAT SOUNDS LIKE
SHE CHANGED HER MIND.

09:42.960 --> 09:45.508
- WELL, CLEARLY
SHE CHANGED HER MIND.

09:45.610 --> 09:46.929
I WOULD NEVER DO THAT.

09:47.030 --> 09:48.474
- YEAH, WELL, TELL YOU WHAT,
WHY DON'T WE DO A LITTLE WORK,

09:48.580 --> 09:49.717
GET YOUR MIND OFF IT, OKAY?

09:49.830 --> 09:51.582
YOU SAID YOU WERE GONNA FIX
THAT BOARD IN STUDIO "A."

09:51.690 --> 09:53.169
- WHAT, ARE YOU GONNA WATCH
IN A RECLINER OR--

09:53.280 --> 09:54.963
- NO, I'M GONNA BE WORKING
ON THAT CONTRACT

09:55.070 --> 09:56.207
FOR THE MEETING

09:56.310 --> 09:57.174

10:03.150 --> 10:04.629

10:10.880 --> 10:11.847
WHEN YOU SAY MISTAH.

10:11.950 --> 10:13.565

10:23.450 --> 10:24.951
MAYBE DROP

10:25.070 --> 10:26.753
JUST HIP IT UP A LITTLE?

10:41.980 --> 10:43.459
CONVINCING HIM

10:43.570 --> 10:45.777
NOT ABOUT CONTRACTS.

10:45.880 --> 10:47.871
CROSBY, YOU TOLD ME THAT
MISTAH R.A.Y. WAS GONNA RECORD

10:47.990 --> 10:49.844

10:51.400 --> 10:52.606

10:54.100 --> 10:55.021
WHEN WE GO AND WE FIND

11:01.000 --> 11:02.410
YOU CAN'T DO THIS IF WE'RE

11:07.010 --> 11:08.147
I'M GONNA LOCK

11:08.250 --> 11:10.309
YOU JUST NEED TO RELAX

23:40.280 --> 23:41.679
AND I LOOK LIKE A CLOWN.
SO WHERE ARE YOU RIGHT NOW?

23:41.790 --> 23:43.269
- I'M AT COLLEGE AND EIGHTH.

23:43.380 --> 23:45.132
- WELL, LISTEN, YOU'RE CLOSER
TO MY HOUSE THAN I AM.

23:45.250 --> 23:46.797
I DON'T HAVE TIME TO GET THERE.
I'M BY MISTAH R.A.Y.'S.

23:46.900 --> 23:48.276
YOU GOTTA GO TO MY HOUSE,
GET ME SOME NORMAL CLOTHES.

23:48.390 --> 23:49.937
GET ME SOME JEANS,
A JACKET, AND A TIE.

23:50.040 --> 23:51.837
NORMAL ADAM BRAVERMAN CLOTHES,
OKAY?

23:51.940 --> 23:53.282
- OKAY.

23:53.390 --> 23:54.527
I JUST WANNA
GET THIS STRAIGHT.

23:54.640 --> 23:56.426
SO YOUR PLAN
IS TO GET NAKED

23:56.530 --> 23:58.213
IN FRONT OF
MISTAH R.A.Y.'S HOUSE?

23:58.330 --> 23:59.319
- YEAH, I'M WEARING BULLDOG--

23:59.430 --> 24:01.773
OH, MY GOD,
A BULLDOG NECKLACE, CROSBY.

24:01.880 --> 24:04.053
JUST GO TO THE HOUSE
AND GET ME SOME NORMAL CLOTHES.

24:04.160 --> 24:05.081
- ALL RIGHT, I WILL.

24:05.200 --> 24:07.782
- THANK YOU.

24:07.890 --> 24:12.680
- ZEEK, YOU'RE GONNA HAVE
TO APOLOGIZE TO SARAH.

24:12.790 --> 24:14.166
- I'M GONNA HAVE TO WHAT?

24:14.280 --> 24:15.269
- GONNA HAVE TO APOLOGIZE
TO SARAH.

24:15.380 --> 24:16.995
COME ON,
IT'S BEEN THREE DAYS.

24:17.110 --> 24:17.997
- YOU WANT ME TO APOLOGIZE

24:18.110 --> 24:20.032
FOR KICKING THAT SCUMBAG
OFF OUR PROPERTY, DO YOU?

24:20.140 --> 24:21.653
- OH, COME ON,
YOU DON'T HAVE TO TALK

24:21.770 --> 24:22.998
ABOUT HIM LIKE THAT.

24:23.110 --> 24:24.725
- I'M NOT GONNA EDIT
MY FEELINGS FOR YOU,

24:24.840 --> 24:26.068
FOR SARAH,
OR FOR ANYBODY ELSE, CAMILLE.

24:26.180 --> 24:28.284
- COME ON, ZEEK, THEY WERE
MARRIED FOR 12 YEARS.

24:28.390 --> 24:30.494
HE'S DREW AND AMBER'S DAD.

24:30.600 --> 24:31.874
- YEAH.
OH, YEAH.

24:31.980 --> 24:33.390
WELL, I WAS THERE TOO,
YOU KNOW?

24:33.500 --> 24:34.706
I MEAN, WHAT'D HE DO,

24:34.810 --> 24:36.630
SPEND HALF THOSE YEARS
DRUNK, LOADED?

24:36.750 --> 24:38.251
WHAT'D HE DO TO DREW?
WHAT'D HE DO TO AMBER?

24:38.370 --> 24:39.598
WHAT'D HE DO TO SARAH?

24:39.710 --> 24:40.881
I MEAN, HE'S THE REASON
FOR MOST OF HER PAIN,

24:40.990 --> 24:43.504
FOR HER HEARTACHE.
- HE HAS A DISEASE.

24:43.620 --> 24:46.646
- MY GOD, CAMILLE, JEEZ.

24:46.760 --> 24:49.376
UGH, YOU ALWAYS HAD
THIS SOFT SPOT IN YOUR HEART

24:49.480 --> 24:51.277
FOR THAT--

24:51.380 --> 24:53.439
- HE NEEDS HELP.

24:53.560 --> 24:54.788
- YEAH, WELL,
HE NEEDS HELP.

24:54.900 --> 24:56.629
I TELL YOU WHAT,
I'M GONNA GET HIM SOME HELP.

24:56.730 --> 24:58.971
HE SHOWS UP HERE
DRUNK OR LOADED AGAIN,

24:59.080 --> 25:00.900
I'M GONNA CALL THE COPS.
- NO, YOU'RE NOT GONNA CALL--

25:01.010 --> 25:02.386
- I'M GONNA CALL THE COPS
ON SETH.

25:02.500 --> 25:03.762
- NO, YOU'RE GONNA
STAY OUT OF IT.

25:03.880 --> 25:05.188
- NO, I'M NOT GONNA
STAY OUT OF IT.

25:05.290 --> 25:06.496
I'M GONNA HANDLE IT.

25:06.600 --> 25:08.420
SHE CAN'T HANDLE IT.
SHE NEVER COULD.

25:08.540 --> 25:12.294
MY GOD, A DISEASE?

25:12.400 --> 25:15.028
- I WANT TO SAY AGAIN

25:15.130 --> 25:17.678
TO THE AMERICAN PEOPLE

25:17.790 --> 25:20.020
HOW PROFOUNDLY SORRY I AM

25:21.720 --> 25:22.926
TO TRIGGER THESE EVENTS

25:23.030 --> 25:25.203
AND THE GREAT BURDEN
THEY HAVE IMPOSED

25:25.310 --> 25:29.417
ON THE CONGRESS
AND ON THE AMERICAN PEOPLE.

25:29.520 --> 25:31.624
- WHAT DID HE DO?

25:31.730 --> 25:33.937
- THE DETAILS
AREN'T REALLY IMPORTANT,

25:34.040 --> 25:36.497
BUT WHAT DO YOU THINK
HE WAS FEELING?

25:36.600 --> 25:39.114
- SAD.
- YES.

25:39.220 --> 25:41.040
OKAY, SO WHY DO YOU THINK
HE WAS FEELING SAD?

25:41.160 --> 25:42.184
- BECAUSE HE'S SAYING,
"I'M SORRY."

25:42.290 --> 25:44.087
- YES, THAT'S TRUE,

25:44.190 --> 25:46.124
BUT WHAT ABOUT HIS FACE

25:46.230 --> 25:47.777
OR WHAT ABOUT HIS EYES,
WHAT ARE THEY DOING?

25:47.890 --> 25:48.959
- WELL, HIS EYES
ARE FACING DOWN.

25:49.060 --> 25:51.119
- YES, HIS EYES
ARE FACING DOWN.

25:51.230 --> 25:52.128
VERY GOOD.

25:52.240 --> 25:54.162
FACING--
- DOWN.

25:54.270 --> 25:55.066
- RIGHT, OKAY.

25:55.170 --> 25:58.025
SO WHAT ELSE?
LIKE, IS HE SMILING OR--

25:58.140 --> 26:00.654
- NO, HE'S NOT SMILING.
- NOT SMILING, OKAY.

26:00.760 --> 26:03.752
- AND HIS VOICE,
IT SOUNDED REAL LOW.

26:03.870 --> 26:05.098
- MM-HMM.
- LIKE THIS.

26:05.210 --> 26:06.484
AND HE WASN'T VERY LOUD.

26:06.590 --> 26:08.217
- YES, GREAT.

26:08.320 --> 26:09.730
THESE ARE GOOD NOTES.

26:09.840 --> 26:10.659
YOU READY TO TRY ONE?

26:10.770 --> 26:13.330
- YES.
- OKAY.

26:14.260 --> 26:16.353
- JABBAR, I'M VERY SORRY
FOR HITTING YOU.

26:16.470 --> 26:18.802
- OKAY, YOUR EYES.

26:18.920 --> 26:20.945
- JABBAR, I'M VERY SORRY
FOR HITTING YOU.

26:21.060 --> 26:22.607
- AND YOUR VOICE.

26:22.710 --> 26:25.019
- [softly] JABBAR, I'M VERY
SORRY FOR HITTING YOU.

26:25.130 --> 26:26.404
- MAX.

26:26.510 --> 26:28.546
THAT WAS SO GOOD.
OH, MY GOSH.

26:28.650 --> 26:29.878
- OKAY, NOW I WANT
ANOTHER ONE.

26:30.000 --> 26:31.956
- OKAY.

26:32.070 --> 26:33.617
- JABBAR, I'M VERY SORRY
FOR HITTING YOU.

26:33.730 --> 26:34.958
- VERY GOOD.

26:35.070 --> 26:36.276
OH, WAIT,
WHAT DO WE SAY?

26:36.380 --> 26:37.824
- THANK YOU.
- EYES.

26:37.940 --> 26:39.555
- THANK YOU.
- TONE.

26:39.660 --> 26:41.241
- THANK YOU.
- OH, BEAUTIFUL.

26:41.350 --> 26:42.760
MY FAVORITE STUDENT.

26:48.950 --> 26:50.838
- OH, SORRY,
I DIDN'T KNOCK.

26:50.950 --> 26:52.986
I DIDN'T KNOW
YOU WERE IN HERE.

26:53.090 --> 26:55.888
UM, ADAM HAD
A BIG SHOPPING DISASTER,

26:55.990 --> 26:57.389
AND I NEED TO GET
A SUIT FOR HIM.

26:57.510 --> 26:59.228
SO MAY I GO UPSTAIRS?

26:59.340 --> 27:00.739
- YEAH.

27:00.860 --> 27:02.430
YOU KNOW WHAT,
I CAN HELP YOU.

27:02.550 --> 27:03.710
- I CAN GET IT.

27:03.820 --> 27:05.026
- I THOUGHT YOU GUYS
HAD THAT MEETING.

27:05.140 --> 27:06.300
- YEAH, I'M ON MY WAY
THERE NOW.

27:06.410 --> 27:07.786
- CROSBY, I CAN HELP YOU.
HEY.

27:07.900 --> 27:11.245
- I CAN GET IT.
- WHAT IS THE MATTER?

27:11.350 --> 27:13.898
YOU OKAY?

27:14.010 --> 27:16.035
- DO YOU KNOW THAT
JASMINE'S SEEING DR. JOE?

27:16.150 --> 27:19.142
- YEAH, SHE MAY HAVE
MENTIONED IT TO ME.

27:19.250 --> 27:20.979
- SO YOU KNOW THAT,

27:21.080 --> 27:22.593
AND THEN YOU STILL TRIED
TO GET AN APPOINTMENT WITH HIM?

27:22.710 --> 27:24.632
- WELL, HE'S A PEDIATRICIAN,

27:24.740 --> 27:26.219
AND WE NEED A PEDIATRICIAN,
CROSBY.

27:26.330 --> 27:28.321
- YEAH, THERE'S A TON OF
PEDIATRICIANS IN THIS CITY.

27:28.430 --> 27:30.057
YOU HAVE TO HAVE THAT ONE?

27:30.160 --> 27:31.707
- OKAY, WHAT IS THE PROBLEM?
I JUST FEEL LIKE--

27:31.820 --> 27:32.775
- OH, WHAT'S THE PROBLEM?

27:32.890 --> 27:34.152
WHAT IF YOU AND ADAM
GOT DIVORCED

27:34.270 --> 27:35.430
AND THEN I STARTED
TAKING MY SON

27:35.550 --> 27:36.778
TO HIS NEW GIRLFRIEND'S
PRACTICE?

27:36.890 --> 27:38.164
YOU DON'T THINK
THAT WOULD BOTHER YOU?

27:38.270 --> 27:40.784
IF THE WHOLE FAMILY WAS GOING
TO SEE ADAM'S NEW GIRLFRIEND?

27:40.900 --> 27:42.788
- ARE YOU UPSET
THAT SHE'S DATING AGAIN?

27:42.900 --> 27:44.959
- NO, I'M NOT UPSET
THAT SHE'S DATING.

27:45.070 --> 27:47.061
I'M UPSET SHE'S DATING
MY SON'S DOCTOR

27:47.180 --> 27:49.148
AND THAT NOW YOU'RE
TRYING TO MAKE HIM

27:49.250 --> 27:50.148
YOUR KID'S DOCTOR.

27:50.250 --> 27:52.241
- YOU ARE OVERREACTING.
- I'M OVERREACTING?

27:52.360 --> 27:54.248
OKAY, WELL, I HOPE IT DOESN'T
EVER HAPPEN TO YOU

27:54.360 --> 27:56.635
SO YOU DON'T HAVE TO FIND OUT
WHETHER I'M OVERREACTING.

27:56.740 --> 27:58.082
- OKAY, FAIR ENOUGH.

27:58.190 --> 27:59.043
- YOU'RE BEING INSENSITIVE,
IS WHAT IT IS.

28:00.810 --> 28:01.913
- YES.
- YOU KNOW WHAT,

28:02.020 --> 28:03.499
YOU'RE INSENSITIVE.

28:03.610 --> 28:05.089
YOU KNOW WHAT'S INSENSITIVE?

28:05.200 --> 28:07.225
INSENSITIVE IS YOU
SLEEPING WITH GABY.

28:07.340 --> 28:09.786
NOW WE CAN'T FIND
A REPLACEMENT FOR GABY STILL.

28:09.890 --> 28:11.118
I ALSO THINK
THAT IT'S INSENSITIVE

28:11.240 --> 28:13.094
FOR YOU TO NOT TELL US
ABOUT JABBAR AND MAX

28:13.200 --> 28:14.952
GETTING IN A FISTFIGHT
AT SCHOOL,

28:15.070 --> 28:16.230
BECAUSE GUESS WHAT,
MAX HAS DETENTION

28:16.340 --> 28:18.035
AND JABBAR DOESN'T.
HE'S OFF SCOT-FREE.

28:18.140 --> 28:20.131
THAT'S REALLY GREAT FOR MAX'S
SELF-ESTEEM, ISN'T IT?

28:20.250 --> 28:22.036
- 'CAUSE I COULDN'T BARE
TO TELL ADAM

28:22.140 --> 28:23.459
THAT JABBAR DIDN'T WANT
TO EAT WITH YOUR SON?

28:23.560 --> 28:25.528
YOU CALL THAT INSENSITIVE?
- THAT'S NOT THE POINT.

28:25.630 --> 28:26.699
THAT'S NOT THE CLOSET,
THAT IS.

28:26.800 --> 28:28.939
YOU KNOW WHAT,
IT DOESN'T MATTER.

28:29.050 --> 28:30.119
- OKAY, WELL,
I HANDLED IT MY WAY,

28:30.220 --> 28:31.073
AND APPARENTLY
IT DIDN'T WORK.

28:31.190 --> 28:32.145
- OKAY, GUESS WHAT,
YOU'RE GONNA HAVE

28:32.260 --> 28:34.251
TO SUCK IT UP
WHILE MY FAMILY SEES DR. JOE

28:34.360 --> 28:36.112
BECAUSE HE'S THE BEST DAMN
PEDIATRICIAN IN TOWN.

28:36.230 --> 28:38.744
AND GUESS WHAT, I'M THINKING
ABOUT MY FAMILY RIGHT NOW.

28:38.850 --> 28:40.465
I'M NOT THINKING
ABOUT YOU, CROSBY.

28:40.580 --> 28:41.842
- HEY, I CARE ABOUT
MY FAMILY TOO!

28:41.960 --> 28:43.530
- AND WHILE WE'RE AT IT,
DON'T LIE TO MY HUSBAND.

28:43.650 --> 28:44.958
- I DID NOT LIE TO HIM!

28:45.060 --> 28:46.095
- YES, YOU HAVE.
DON'T TELL HIM

28:46.200 --> 28:48.134
THAT YOU HAVE A CLIENT BOOKED
AND YOU DON'T.

28:48.240 --> 28:50.026
- I DIDN'T TELL HIM
I HAD HIM BOOKED.

28:50.140 --> 28:51.858
I NEVER SAID THAT I HAD
A CLIENT BOOKED, OKAY?

28:51.970 --> 28:53.062
I SAID PEOPLE
WOULD FOLLOW ME OVER.

28:53.170 --> 28:55.058
THAT DOESN'T MEAN WE DON'T
HAVE TO MEET WITH THEM.

28:55.180 --> 28:56.340
- ACT LIKE AN ADULT
IF YOU'RE GONNA BE IN BUSINESS

28:56.450 --> 28:57.963
WITH MY HUSBAND.

28:58.080 --> 28:59.581
- HEY, I'M IN BUSINESS WITH
YOUR HUSBAND, NOT YOU, OKAY?

28:59.700 --> 29:00.689
I DON'T NEED
TO TAKE THIS FROM YOU.

29:00.800 --> 29:01.869
I'M GONNA GO
CLOSE THIS DEAL.

29:01.980 --> 29:03.356
- YOU KNOW WHAT,
CLOSE THE DAMN DEAL

29:03.460 --> 29:05.803
BECAUSE YOU DON'T EVEN
HAVE A DEAL TO CLOSE.

29:05.910 --> 29:08.663
- YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT
THE HELL YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT.

29:08.780 --> 29:10.111
- CROSBY!

29:10.230 --> 29:12.744
- WHAT?

29:12.850 --> 29:14.226
- CAN YOU COME HERE
FOR A MINUTE?

29:14.330 --> 29:17.914
- LISTEN, I DON'T HAVE TIME
TO HAVE THIS ARGUMENT.

29:18.030 --> 29:18.951
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

29:19.060 --> 29:21.267
- MY WATER JUST BROKE.

29:21.380 --> 29:23.302
- OKAY, WHAT--

29:28.040 --> 29:29.268
- OKAY, I NEED YOU
TO CALL ADAM RIGHT NOW.

29:29.380 --> 29:30.347
GET HIM ON THE PHONE.

29:30.450 --> 29:31.963
- ADAM, ADAM, MAN,
YOU GOTTA FORGET THE MEETING.

29:32.080 --> 29:34.219
WE ARE CODE BLUE RIGHT NOW.
KRISTINA IS IN LABOR.

29:34.320 --> 29:36.174
YOU GOTTA GET
TO THE HOSPITAL NOW.

29:36.290 --> 29:38.212
- CROSBY, JUST STOP--
- WHAT?

29:38.320 --> 29:40.459
WHAT DO YOU WANT ME TO DO?
I'M GOING AS FAST AS I CAN.

29:40.570 --> 29:42.595
- OOH!
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

29:42.710 --> 29:44.849
- OH, OH, OH!
OH, GOD!

29:44.950 --> 29:46.019
- HOLD IT.
- OH, I CAN'T.

29:46.120 --> 29:47.257
I'M GONNA HAVE THIS BABY
IN YOUR CAR.

29:47.370 --> 29:49.258
- YOU'RE NOT HAVING
THE BABY IN THE CAR, KRISTINA.

29:49.370 --> 29:51.531
- JUST DRIVE.

29:55.510 --> 29:56.954
- CROSBY.

30:00.830 --> 30:02.991
[hip-hop music]

30:03.110 --> 30:04.418
- YOU EXPECTING SOMEBODY?

30:04.520 --> 30:07.648
- HELL NO.

30:07.770 --> 30:09.032
- HEY, I THOUGHT--
- YOU LOST?

30:09.150 --> 30:10.356
- NO, NO, NO, I'M NOT LOST.

30:10.460 --> 30:11.939
I'M HERE FOR THE MEETING.
MISTAH R.A.Y.

30:12.050 --> 30:13.938
I'M BRAVERMAN.
ADAM BRAVERMAN.

30:14.050 --> 30:15.426
HI.
- YOU'RE CROSBY'S BROTHER?

30:15.530 --> 30:16.667
- YES, I AM.

30:16.780 --> 30:19.089
- YOU DON'T LOOK
LIKE CROSBY'S BROTHER.

30:19.190 --> 30:20.498
- I AM.
I'M CROSBY'S BROTHER, ADAM.

30:20.610 --> 30:22.293
ADAM BRAVERMAN,
AND I JUST--

30:22.400 --> 30:24.709
I'M A LITTLE LATE, AND I'M SURE
HE'S JUST STUCK IN TRAFFIC.

30:24.820 --> 30:25.980
AND YOU KNOW WHAT,
YOU GUYS ARE LATE TOO,

30:26.100 --> 30:27.021
SO IT'S ALL GOOD.

30:27.130 --> 30:28.779
- COME HERE.
- YEAH, WHAT?

30:28.890 --> 30:31.711
- COME HERE.

30:31.830 --> 30:33.138
- NICE DUDS.

30:33.240 --> 30:36.300
[laughter]

30:36.420 --> 30:37.614
- THANK YOU.

30:37.730 --> 30:39.061
- SHOULD I JUST PULL IN?

30:39.180 --> 30:41.034
- COME ON, MAN, FOLLOW ME.

30:41.140 --> 30:42.482
- ALL RIGHT, OKAY, I JUST GOTTA
GRAB SOME STUFF FROM MY CAR,

30:42.590 --> 30:44.831
AND I'LL--OKAY.

30:57.710 --> 31:00.361
- DOES YOUR HUSBAND ALWAYS
LET YOUR DAUGHTER DO THAT?

31:00.470 --> 31:01.789
- WHAT?

31:01.890 --> 31:03.926
OH, LET HER PAINT HIS NAILS?

34:20.430 --> 34:22.466
I DON'T KNOW.
HONESTLY, I DON'T KNOW.

34:22.570 --> 34:24.151
CROSBY WOULD REALLY BE
THE PERSON TO TALK TO

34:24.260 --> 34:25.602
ABOUT THE EQUIPMENT.
- WELL, HE AIN'T HERE.

34:25.710 --> 34:27.223

UNDERSTAND WHAT HAPPENED.

34:27.340 --> 34:30.548
I'M VERY SORRY.
HE JUST MUST BE DELAYED.

34:30.650 --> 34:32.811
- SO WHAT ABOUT YOU,
YOU BEEN DOING THIS FOR LONG?

34:32.930 --> 34:34.238

34:34.340 --> 34:35.068
I'M JUST GETTING STARTED
IN THE RECORDING INDUSTRY,

34:35.170 --> 34:36.023

I MEAN, I REALLY--
I LOVED WHAT I HEARD, I DID.

34:46.910 --> 34:48.969
I THINK THAT SOMETIMES
IT CAN BE A LITTLE CRUDE.

34:49.080 --> 34:50.388
- WHAT?

34:50.500 --> 34:53.253
- THE EXPLICIT LANGUAGE,
I THINK IT'S TOO MUCH.

34:53.360 --> 34:55.089

35:04.610 --> 35:07.090
YOU'RE A POET,
AND I'M NOT JUST SAYING THAT.

35:09.450 --> 35:11.338
DID THAT REALLY HAPPEN?
- HELL, YEAH, THAT HAPPENED.

35:11.450 --> 35:12.610
YOU THINK I'D MAKE THAT UP?

35:12.730 --> 35:13.685
- NO, NO, GOD, NO.

35:13.800 --> 35:16.132
NO, NOT AT ALL.
I JUST--I'M VERY SORRY.

35:16.250 --> 35:17.865
I DON'T KNOW WHAT I'D DO
IF MY BROTHER GOT SHOT.

35:17.970 --> 35:19.210
THAT MUST HAVE BEEN
REALLY HARD.

35:19.320 --> 35:20.389

ALL THE CURSING,

35:27.260 --> 35:29.421

39:50.690 --> 39:52.203
- OH, HI.
- HEY.

39:52.320 --> 39:54.629
- COME IN.
- NO, I CAN'T STAY.

39:54.730 --> 39:56.664
- IS EVERYTHING OKAY?

39:56.770 --> 39:59.113
- YEAH, I'M FINE.
- HEY.

39:59.220 --> 40:00.312
- HI.

40:00.430 --> 40:01.636

THOSE PAINS AGAIN?

40:01.740 --> 40:03.492
- NO, I'M OKAY.
I'M GOOD.

40:03.600 --> 40:05.636
I'M SORRY TO COME HERE
THIS LATE.

40:05.740 --> 40:08.049
- IT'S OKAY.
WHAT'S GOING ON?

40:08.160 --> 40:09.604
- YOU CONTROL THE GAME

40:09.710 --> 40:12.156
WITHOUT PLAYING IT RIGHT

40:12.270 --> 40:14.056
- IF YOU STILL--IF YOU STILL
WANT TO HAVE MY BABY,

40:14.170 --> 40:17.856
YOU CAN HAVE IT.

40:21.550 --> 40:23.199
YOU HAVE A NICE FAMILY.

40:30.040 --> 40:34.079
- RAISE HIGH IN ME

40:34.190 --> 40:39.423
WHAT ONCE DID SINK BELOW

40:43.640 --> 40:47.644
ALL DARK WITHIN NOW

40:47.750 --> 40:50.878
RADIANTLY GLOWS

40:51.000 --> 40:52.752
- [sobs]

40:57.210 --> 40:59.678
- COME ON TAKE ME BACK

40:59.800 --> 41:03.964
ALL THAT TIME AGO

41:04.080 --> 41:05.934
[phone buzzing]

41:15.850 --> 41:17.112
- GOD.

41:17.230 --> 41:20.438
SETH?

41:20.540 --> 41:23.429
- OUR LOVE WAS JUST

41:23.550 --> 41:27.850
ONE OF YOUR
DISCARDED JEWELS

41:27.960 --> 41:30.895
[bell sounds]

41:31.000 --> 41:33.867
- HELLO?

41:33.970 --> 41:37.133
- YOU THINK BACK
TO ITS PRICE

41:37.250 --> 41:42.358
AND OH YOU FEEL A FOOL

41:47.780 --> 41:50.419
IN THAT CERTAIN LIGHT

41:50.540 --> 41:54.124
IT LOOKED SO BEAUTIFUL

41:54.230 --> 41:56.369
[loud crash]

41:58.370 --> 42:01.191
- SETH?

42:01.310 --> 42:05.167
OH, NO.

42:12.110 --> 42:14.249
- YOU CAME.
