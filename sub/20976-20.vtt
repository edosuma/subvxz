08:56.533 --> 08:59.533
- There is.
- And usually when I see that,

08:59.600 --> 09:01.166
it means
there's an open roof deformity.

09:01.200 --> 09:04.533
An open roof deformity
is when a nasal hump

09:04.600 --> 09:05.667
has been rasped down,

09:05.734 --> 09:06.667
and now the nasal bones

09:06.734 --> 09:08.266
went from being like this

09:08.333 --> 09:09.700
to now like that.

09:09.734 --> 09:12.166
I don't know if he fractured--
he didn't break it.

09:12.200 --> 09:13.700
Feel that real quick.

09:13.734 --> 09:15.100
- Do you think he shaved it?
- He filed. He did.

09:15.166 --> 09:16.667
- He filed it down
and just left it alone.

09:16.734 --> 09:18.567
And your tip, it's just pretty
much going in its own direction.

09:18.600 --> 09:19.567
- It is.

09:20.533 --> 09:21.767
- The doctor took too much
of your tip cartilage,

09:22.033 --> 09:25.000
and this is why it's crooked,
it's collapsed.

09:25.066 --> 09:27.567
This nostril's lifted up
on the left side.

09:27.600 --> 09:28.567
You know,
you got some things going on.

09:29.533 --> 09:31.133
And now what we want to do
is take a look inside.

09:31.200 --> 09:34.000
- He did take
all of the turbinates out.

09:34.066 --> 09:35.166
- So let me check because

09:35.200 --> 09:37.700
if that's the case,
we got a big problem.

09:37.734 --> 09:38.500
Okay, put your head back.

09:40.567 --> 09:42.000
Take a look
all the way over there.

09:42.066 --> 09:43.266
- Wow.
- Look at the turbinate.

09:43.333 --> 09:44.467
- Yeah, it's gone.
- Gone.

09:45.633 --> 09:46.600
- When someone removes
the inferior turbinates,

09:46.633 --> 09:48.000
you lose two things:

09:48.066 --> 09:50.066
one, humidity,
and two, the resistance.

09:50.100 --> 09:52.700
So you feel like you have
this huge open tunnel,

09:52.767 --> 09:54.700
and the air goes in,
and it bounces back and forth,

09:54.767 --> 09:56.567
and you feel like
you have nasal obstruction.

09:56.633 --> 09:59.133
With the turbinates gone,
I hate saying this,

09:59.200 --> 10:02.734
but there's not a good way
to fix your breathing.

10:02.767 --> 10:04.033
And here's the other thing.

10:04.100 --> 10:05.700
To make your nose
more symmetric,

10:05.767 --> 10:08.667
when we add cartilage here,
I'm making it look better,

10:08.734 --> 10:11.066
but your breathing can be made
even worse

10:11.100 --> 10:14.734
by me working on the outside
appearance of your nose.

10:14.767 --> 10:16.667
Jessica has empty nose syndrome.

10:16.734 --> 10:20.133
But now with me making the nose
aesthetically more pleasing,

10:20.200 --> 10:23.767
that automatically is gonna make
the nasal airways bigger.

10:24.000 --> 10:28.200
So that, in essence, can make
her nasal obstruction worse.

True story.

So before the chemo,

12:38.767 --> 12:41.300
I was maintaining a weight
of about 150 pounds.

12:41.367 --> 12:45.200

I went down to 118 pounds.

12:45.233 --> 12:46.467
So I went to my doctor,

got affected by the chemo.

doing the protein,

12:52.767 --> 12:53.734

12:54.700 --> 12:56.066
I finally gained
seven pounds back,

12:56.100 --> 12:58.033
and my arms are still small.

12:58.100 --> 13:03.033
I decided to get a little
silicone implant in my bicep

13:03.100 --> 13:04.200

13:10.367 --> 13:13.367
who seemed to be an expert
in male implants.

13:13.400 --> 13:15.767
When I took the bandages
off my arms,

13:16.000 --> 13:19.066
my left bicep seemed
to develop a lot of fluid.

13:19.133 --> 13:21.700
I had to have it
drained four times,

13:21.767 --> 13:23.734

it was getting sucked in.

anything like this before?"

13:33.133 --> 13:34.233

17:34.600 --> 17:38.266
♪ ♪

17:38.333 --> 17:40.533
- The next patient is someone
we wouldn't normally

17:40.600 --> 17:41.533
see in our practice.

17:41.600 --> 17:42.533
His name's Joey.

17:42.600 --> 17:44.066
He's very into fitness,

17:44.100 --> 17:45.433
but he had a medical condition

17:45.467 --> 17:47.200
which caused him to lose
a lot of muscle mass,

17:47.233 --> 17:49.266
so he started getting
these muscle implants.

17:49.333 --> 17:52.133
- Oh.
- Which normally we don't treat

17:52.200 --> 17:53.433
'cause we'd rather people
go to the gym.

17:53.467 --> 17:55.300
But he's having a problem,
so let's see him

17:55.333 --> 17:56.433
and see if we can help him.

17:56.467 --> 17:57.767
- Can you please send in Joey?

17:59.166 --> 18:00.567
Joey, hi, Dr. Nassif.

18:00.600 --> 18:01.467
- Hi, nice to meet you.
- Hi, Joey, Terry Dubrow.

18:02.300 --> 18:03.100
- Hi, it's a pleasure.
- Pleasure.

18:03.166 --> 18:05.066
- Look at that tan on you.
- Always.

18:05.100 --> 18:06.200
- Yeah.
- You guys--you know,

18:06.233 --> 18:07.433
actually you got a tan
almost like that

18:07.500 --> 18:08.533
because you like doing that.

18:09.567 --> 18:10.600
- I was just on vacation.
- I thought Terry was dark

18:10.633 --> 18:12.300
when he got that tan.

18:12.367 --> 18:14.633
Nah. Joey beats him by a mile.

18:14.667 --> 18:16.567
- Tell us your journey
with body implants.

18:16.633 --> 18:18.500
- I was Mr. New England in 1986.

18:18.533 --> 18:20.200
- And was that
a bodybuilding contest?

18:20.233 --> 18:21.433
- No, it was like a male version
of Miss America.

18:21.500 --> 18:22.600
I mean, it was--
- Oh, beauty pageant.

18:22.633 --> 18:24.066
- It was--
yes.

18:24.100 --> 18:26.600
It was in a swimsuit,
in formal wear.

18:26.633 --> 18:28.033
- They do that for men?
- No kidding.

18:29.233 --> 18:31.166
- Yeah, there's a Mr. America.
- Paul could be Mr. Universe.

18:31.233 --> 18:33.567
Not for his looks,
but for the size of his ass.

18:33.633 --> 18:36.300
Could you imagine him in the
bikini portion of the contest?

18:36.367 --> 18:38.600
Could you, just spilling
out over a mankini?

18:38.633 --> 18:42.467
- Terry's just jealous
because I'm pageant material.

18:42.533 --> 18:45.100
If we both were
in Speedos right now,

18:45.133 --> 18:46.667
I would look a lot better
than you,

18:46.700 --> 18:51.100
except for my abs and my chest.

18:51.133 --> 18:53.233
But my lower half,
I'm gonna say I beat you.

18:53.266 --> 18:54.166
Lower half.

18:55.066 --> 18:56.633
- Sorry, Paul,
but it's all or nothing.

18:56.667 --> 18:59.066
Just because you think
you have nice calves,

18:59.133 --> 19:00.633
you're not Mr. Beverly Hills.

19:00.667 --> 19:03.400
- Before I did the implants,
I had cancer.

19:03.433 --> 19:05.333
- What kind of cancer?
- It was lymphoma.

19:05.400 --> 19:08.500
- Okay.
- I went from 155 to 118.

19:08.533 --> 19:10.467
- Wow.
- Everybody thought I was dying.

19:10.533 --> 19:12.100
- You're totally
in remission now?

19:12.133 --> 19:13.367
- Everything's good. Everything.

19:13.400 --> 19:14.533
- How many years has it been?
- Four.

19:14.567 --> 19:16.266
So I went to my doctor.

19:16.300 --> 19:18.500
He said less muscle mass,
bone density.

19:18.533 --> 19:20.633
So I did my research,
and I found this doctor.

19:20.667 --> 19:22.133
I liked his work.

19:22.166 --> 19:23.500
- What part of the body?

19:23.533 --> 19:24.433
- My biceps,
because my arms are skinny.

19:25.300 --> 19:25.567
- So that's the operation
you had first.

19:25.600 --> 19:26.633
- Mm-hmm.

19:26.700 --> 19:28.533
- So what was the result
of that?

19:28.567 --> 19:30.500
- So I developed fluid.

19:30.567 --> 19:32.300
He took the fluid out twice.

19:32.333 --> 19:33.533
- When you put an implant in

19:33.567 --> 19:34.667
and fluid continues
to accumulate,

19:34.700 --> 19:36.300
that's called a seroma.

19:36.333 --> 19:38.633
That's a--can be
a difficult problem to fix.

19:38.700 --> 19:41.166
- And he said to me, "The only
way I know how to fix that,

19:41.200 --> 19:42.133
"you have to gain 8 pounds,

19:43.066 --> 19:44.233
"and I'll suck the fat out
and put it back in.

19:44.300 --> 19:45.633
- So you had a fat graft
in your arm.

19:45.700 --> 19:47.367
- Yeah.
- Over an implant.

19:47.433 --> 19:48.500
- Well, wait, so it gets better.

19:48.567 --> 19:49.500
- I've never heard of that.
Have you?

19:49.567 --> 19:50.433
- It gets better, wait.

19:51.333 --> 19:51.567
- There's a reason
you never heard of that.

19:52.266 --> 19:53.233
- So I got tricep implants.

19:53.300 --> 19:54.266
- Wait, wait,
you're having a problem

19:54.300 --> 19:55.367
with the biceps, so in order--

19:56.433 --> 19:57.567
- So while I was there--
- They put tricep implants.

19:57.600 --> 19:59.500
- I said to him, "Do me a favor.

19:59.567 --> 20:01.533
Make sure
they just accent the bicep."

20:01.567 --> 20:03.633
I said I don't want any--
you know, just a little.

20:03.700 --> 20:05.367
Anyway, long story short--

20:05.433 --> 20:06.667
- They're huge?
- Oh, my God.

20:06.734 --> 20:09.166
- When you have a complication,

20:09.200 --> 20:11.266
you should deal
with the complication

20:11.333 --> 20:14.667
and not do an additional
procedure at the same time.

20:14.734 --> 20:18.300
- Your main issue now sounds
like you're having a problem

20:18.333 --> 20:21.433
with the contour
of the left bicep,

20:21.467 --> 20:23.400
and your triceps are too big.

20:23.467 --> 20:24.667
- Yeah.

20:24.734 --> 20:26.133
- What would you like
to happen theoretically?

20:26.200 --> 20:27.400
- I just want
normal-looking arms.

20:27.467 --> 20:28.567
- So you want
normal-looking arms

20:28.600 --> 20:30.567
that are a little bigger
than normal?

20:30.600 --> 20:32.133
- So he wants implants.
- Mm-hmm.

20:32.200 --> 20:33.567
- We need to go in
and examine you,

20:33.600 --> 20:35.266
but I want to plant this thought

20:35.333 --> 20:36.600
in the back of your head,
all right?

20:36.633 --> 20:39.266
Plastic surgery procedures,
the common ones,

20:39.333 --> 20:42.700
the top ten, they have
about a 5% complication rate.

20:42.734 --> 20:44.567
When you go
to the unconventional,

20:44.600 --> 20:46.266
like body implants,

20:46.333 --> 20:49.600
they have a complication rate
way over 35%.

20:49.633 --> 20:52.600
The reason guys like us
don't do this kind of surgery

20:52.633 --> 20:54.567
is because the risks
outweigh the benefits.

20:54.633 --> 20:56.667
The complication rate
is prohibitive.

20:56.734 --> 20:58.700
In order to figure out
what the best options are,

20:58.767 --> 21:00.433
let's go do an exam, okay?

21:00.500 --> 21:01.533
All right, let's go.

21:02.633 --> 21:03.567
- It's starting to sound
like Dr. Dubrow

21:03.633 --> 21:04.567
may not be able to help me.

21:04.633 --> 21:06.367
I'd be devastated if not.

21:06.400 --> 21:07.700
I don't know
where I'm gonna turn.

21:07.767 --> 21:09.433
- So this is
a bicep implant here.

21:09.500 --> 21:11.567
How was this put in?
- Underneath.

21:11.633 --> 21:13.734
- The armpit.
And then the tricep implant?

21:13.767 --> 21:15.734
You know what's interesting?
These...

21:15.767 --> 21:18.233
You've got really good
muscular development here.

21:18.266 --> 21:19.500
These aren't implants
at all, right?

21:19.533 --> 21:20.734
- No.

21:20.767 --> 21:22.633
- So if you've developed
these so beautifully,

21:22.667 --> 21:25.200
why can't you develop
your own natural triceps?

21:25.233 --> 21:26.233
Let me see this one.

21:26.266 --> 21:27.567
So this is
the problem area, yes?

21:27.633 --> 21:29.600
- Oh.
- Go like this.

21:31.233 --> 21:32.333
It's interesting.

21:32.400 --> 21:34.500
This is where it looks more
unnatural to me than this one.

21:34.533 --> 21:35.500
- Oh,
this one is no good either.

21:35.533 --> 21:36.400
This one's cutting in my armpit.

21:37.266 --> 21:39.266
- Yeah, this one's
sort of way displaced.

21:39.300 --> 21:43.333
So this one actually does have a
complication called malposition,

21:43.400 --> 21:46.367
and then these,
although they're in place

21:46.400 --> 21:47.533
and they're stable,

21:47.567 --> 21:49.633
they're very big
and very projecting.

21:49.667 --> 21:50.600
- Yeah.
- It's not that--to me,

21:50.667 --> 21:51.667
it's not they're so wide.

21:51.700 --> 21:53.500
It's they're so tall.

21:53.533 --> 21:54.600
If I was Joey,

21:54.667 --> 21:55.734
I would just take them out

21:56.000 --> 21:57.367
and do some work in the gym.

21:57.400 --> 21:59.633
Take these out.
Enough of the complications.

21:59.667 --> 22:01.467
Implants aren't working for you.

22:01.533 --> 22:03.633
Come on. You're a smart guy.

22:03.667 --> 22:04.667
- I just can't imagine

22:04.700 --> 22:06.667
going back
to the two skinny arms

22:06.700 --> 22:08.633
that I had before
this whole thing happened.

22:08.667 --> 22:10.633
The one that's cutting in my arm
doesn't bother me.

22:10.667 --> 22:13.433
- You want to keep this one
even though it's malpositioned

22:13.467 --> 22:15.300
and in your armpit?

22:15.333 --> 22:18.000
The nerves in your armpit
are called the brachial plexus.

22:18.033 --> 22:21.767
They control all the movement
and sensation in your arms.

22:22.033 --> 22:24.667
Those are migrating
up into your armpit

22:24.700 --> 22:27.633
and ultimately may cause
motor nerve injury

22:27.700 --> 22:29.667
and atrophy of your hands.

22:29.700 --> 22:30.600
And then if that happens,

22:31.533 --> 22:33.633
then you'll lose the ability
to lift weights

22:33.700 --> 22:35.500
in order to maximize

22:35.567 --> 22:37.633
the muscular development
in your arms.

22:37.700 --> 22:40.367
I don't think
it's that he can't build muscle.

22:40.433 --> 22:42.567
I think he has
unrealistic expectations.

22:42.600 --> 22:45.500
Over time, this situation's
gonna get worse.

22:45.567 --> 22:47.633
Here's what we
can help you with.

22:47.700 --> 22:50.633
We can take the implant out,
release the scar tissue,

22:50.700 --> 22:52.667
take the capsule out
surrounding the implant,

22:52.700 --> 22:55.567
and then that'll allow
everything to sort of heal okay

22:55.600 --> 22:56.533
and look better.

22:56.600 --> 22:58.433
What do you think?

22:58.467 --> 23:00.767
- I think you gave me
some good information, and...

23:03.300 --> 23:06.600
I came here thinking Dr. Dubrow
can replace the implants,

23:06.633 --> 23:07.700
and I don't think
that's gonna happen.

23:08.767 --> 23:11.600
So I'm gonna sleep on it,
and we'll see what happens.

23:11.633 --> 23:13.433
- All right, well,
you think about it,

23:13.467 --> 23:15.533
and we'll reconvene
and talk about it

23:15.600 --> 23:17.266
and see what
you've decided maybe.

23:17.333 --> 23:19.266
- Sounds good to me.
- All right, buddy. All right.

23:19.333 --> 23:20.700
- Thank you, guys.
- You're welcome.

23:22.433 --> 23:24.300
- I'm a professional sugar baby.

23:24.333 --> 23:25.300
- What're we talking about
financially?

23:26.233 --> 23:28.433
- Elite sugar babies
get maybe $6,000 a month.

23:28.467 --> 23:29.667
- You ever thought
about doing this?

23:29.734 --> 23:32.300
- Are you single?
[laughs]

23:32.333 --> 23:34.600
- I took all your photos.
- Okay.

23:34.633 --> 23:37.300
- I laid 'em out on the kitchen
counter last night.

23:37.367 --> 23:40.367
I had my three children
look at your nose

23:40.400 --> 23:42.567
to decide what is
the best nose for you.

23:42.633 --> 23:44.567
- Oh, awesome.

23:44.633 --> 23:45.667
- What do you think?

23:50.633 --> 23:52.500
- ♪ I want to be perfect ♪

23:53.767 --> 23:56.667
♪ ♪

23:56.734 --> 23:58.600
both: Hi.
- How are you? Morning.

23:58.633 --> 24:00.533
- Welcome.
- Thank you.

24:00.600 --> 24:01.734
I am excited.

24:01.767 --> 24:04.333
It could just be done.
Wait. Love you.

24:04.367 --> 24:05.600
- Okay. Love you, too. Okay?

24:05.633 --> 24:07.333
I'll be here when you're--
when you wake up.

24:07.367 --> 24:08.333
- Okay.

24:08.367 --> 24:10.333
I could feel like the woman

24:10.367 --> 24:11.700
Brad should be with.

24:11.767 --> 24:13.467
- Good morning!
- Hi!

24:13.500 --> 24:15.166
- How you feeling?
- Excited.

24:15.233 --> 24:16.633
- You're excited?
- A little nervous.

24:16.667 --> 24:18.767
- I took all your photos.
- Okay.

24:19.000 --> 24:21.633
- I laid 'em out on the kitchen
counter last night.

24:21.667 --> 24:24.734
I had my three children
look at your nose

24:25.000 --> 24:27.066
to decide what is
the best nose for you.

24:27.133 --> 24:30.100
- Oh, awesome.
- What do you think?

24:30.133 --> 24:31.500
My kids did this.

24:31.533 --> 24:33.633
Remember we talked about
how the previous doctor

24:33.667 --> 24:34.767
took out your turbinates.

24:35.000 --> 24:37.100
- He did.
- So there's that whole chance

24:37.133 --> 24:39.367
just by putting
the cartilage here

24:39.400 --> 24:40.633
that that airway's gonna get
a little bit bigger

24:42.033 --> 24:44.100
and that you possibly can say
that your airway is even worse.

24:44.133 --> 24:45.467
- Yeah.
- Who knows?

24:45.533 --> 24:46.734
I mean, the point is
there's also that chance

24:47.000 --> 24:48.033
we can put the cartilage in,

24:49.133 --> 24:50.734
especially on your right side,
where it's collapsed,

24:51.000 --> 24:52.600
and you could say,
"Hey, I can breathe better."

24:52.667 --> 24:53.500
And that's a bonus
if that happens.

24:54.400 --> 24:55.433
- It is.
- For Jessica's surgery,

24:56.567 --> 24:57.300
my team will start
by harvesting rib cartilage

24:58.467 --> 24:59.533
while I take composite grafts
from each ear.

25:00.767 --> 25:01.767
Then I'll open up her nose,
take down the nasal hump,

25:03.233 --> 25:05.233
and fix her open roof deformity
by fracturing the nasal bones.

25:05.300 --> 25:09.000
Next, I will use alar batten
grafts to make nostrils wider.

25:09.033 --> 25:10.633
The last thing,
I'll use composite grafts

25:10.700 --> 25:12.400
to lengthen her nostrils.

25:12.433 --> 25:15.367
I'm marking the ears
for the composite graft,

25:15.433 --> 25:18.500
and Dr. Peng is harvesting rib.

25:20.133 --> 25:21.767
Okay, and here's your
composite graft from the left,

25:22.033 --> 25:24.633
and this is skin,
and this is cartilage.

25:24.700 --> 25:26.667
Okay, we've finished
taking the composite grafts.

25:26.700 --> 25:30.000
Now we're gonna inject the nose
and start the rhinoplasty.

25:30.033 --> 25:33.400
Okay, so I'm lifting
the tissue off the bone.

25:33.433 --> 25:35.100
So we've opened up the nose,

25:35.166 --> 25:37.667
and now we're fracturing
nasal bones.

25:37.700 --> 25:41.166
Go. Go.

25:41.200 --> 25:43.133
When someone has
asymmetrical nasal bones,

25:43.200 --> 25:45.667
such as
the right bone was oblique

25:45.734 --> 25:47.033
and the left bone
was more vertical,

25:48.166 --> 25:50.700
and there was an open roof,
a gap, that causes problems

25:50.734 --> 25:52.033
when we're trying
to fracture the nasal bones

25:52.066 --> 25:53.433
and get 'em symmetrical.

25:53.467 --> 25:55.633
I fractured
Jessica's nasal bones

25:55.700 --> 25:57.700
in about five different places.

25:57.734 --> 26:01.166
And now we can do
the tip nasal reconstruction

26:01.200 --> 26:04.133
and also reconstruct
the middle part of the nose.

26:04.200 --> 26:05.533
The intraoperative decision
I made

26:05.600 --> 26:07.433
is to not build up the dorsum

26:07.467 --> 26:10.166
but bring her nose back
and then de-project her tip

26:10.200 --> 26:12.667
basically to match
her lower middle vault.

26:14.166 --> 26:15.633
[sighs]

26:15.700 --> 26:17.633
Okay, reconstructing
this middle vault has been hard.

26:17.700 --> 26:20.233
I think I'm pretty good
on the symmetry

26:20.300 --> 26:22.066
of the middle part of the nose.

26:22.100 --> 26:26.633
Now is reconstructing
the tip of the nose.

26:26.667 --> 26:28.467
The domes of the cartilage
are so sharp,

26:28.500 --> 26:30.066
even if I cover them,
I have a feeling

26:30.100 --> 26:31.734
they're gonna start popping
through the skin again

26:31.767 --> 26:34.734
and see 'em.
Jessica's nasal domes,

26:34.767 --> 26:37.667
which are the peaks
of the cartilage here, unusable.

26:37.734 --> 26:40.567
And it's rare
that I'll actually shave them.

26:40.633 --> 26:44.567
Hopefully I'm gonna give the tip
something gentle and smooth.

26:44.633 --> 26:46.600
Okay, we finished with the tip.

26:46.633 --> 26:48.667
We put
lateral crural strut grafts in

26:48.734 --> 26:50.467
to make the airway
a little bit more symmetric

26:50.500 --> 26:51.600
and the cartilage
more symmetric.

26:52.700 --> 26:57.700
However, the right side
is probably about 85% better.

26:57.767 --> 26:58.533
The profile is a lot better.

26:59.367 --> 27:01.600
The middle vault
is more symmetric.

27:01.633 --> 27:03.767
Her nostrils are lower.

you're gonna have
a much smaller bicep

worse than you were

33:58.133 --> 34:00.166
- Okay.
I will begin Joey's surgery

34:00.200 --> 34:03.033
by entering through his
previous scars under his armpits

34:03.066 --> 34:05.100

to his left bicep,

34:09.200 --> 34:10.300
before taking out the implant.

34:11.433 --> 34:12.767

the underlying muscle

to an understanding

such trouble building muscle.

34:18.600 --> 34:20.300
We're gonna start
on the right side

34:20.333 --> 34:22.600

that first tricep implant.

34:22.633 --> 34:23.567
So here's the implant.

34:24.500 --> 34:26.200
You can almost flip
these implants around,

in relationship to his arm.
