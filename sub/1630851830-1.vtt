00:10.720 --> 00:13.920
Our universe
Is a place of infinite variety.

00:15.920 --> 00:18.120
Two trillion galaxies.

00:22.080 --> 00:25.000
Billions and billions of stars.

00:28.080 --> 00:29.840
And countless planets.

00:30.880 --> 00:33.320
Worlds beyond imagination.

00:37.960 --> 00:39.720
The universe is so vast,

00:39.800 --> 00:43.200
so incomprehensible, so terrifying,

00:43.280 --> 00:45.240
that I think it's quite natural
for us to choose

00:45.320 --> 00:48.160
to live out our lives
completely oblivious to it.

00:51.920 --> 00:56.200
Perhaps that's why there's a sense
of relief that rises with the dawn.

00:56.280 --> 01:01.040
The brightening sky hides the stars
and the questions that they pose.

01:03.160 --> 01:06.360
After all,
they are the biggest questions.

01:09.320 --> 01:11.160
How did the universe come to be?

01:12.640 --> 01:13.760
Why are we here?

01:15.360 --> 01:17.120
And how will it all end?

01:23.480 --> 01:25.320
We have to face those questions

01:25.400 --> 01:30.040
if we're ever to acquire
a truly deep understanding of ourselves.

01:30.120 --> 01:33.200
You see, astronomy challenges us.

01:33.280 --> 01:36.840
From one perspective,
we're just grains of sand adrift

01:36.920 --> 01:39.800
in an infinite and indifferent ocean.

01:39.880 --> 01:44.600
But from another perspective, we are
nature's most magnificent creation.

01:44.680 --> 01:49.280
Collections of atoms that can think
and wonder about the universe

01:49.360 --> 01:52.080
and choose to explore it.

01:54.120 --> 01:58.160
Five, four,
three, two, one.

01:58.520 --> 02:00.920
We have lift-off. All systems go.

02:06.640 --> 02:11.040
In our quest for answers,
we re venturing ever further from home,

02:11.640 --> 02:13.320
far beyond the planets...

02:16.800 --> 02:18.920
and out to the stars.

02:22.600 --> 02:27.080
Our spacecraft are sending back
a stream of extraordinary revelations.

02:29.440 --> 02:31.840
Visions of alien worlds...

02:34.280 --> 02:37.360
with the ingredients to create life.

02:44.480 --> 02:46.680
We've seen galaxies collide,

02:51.160 --> 02:54.240
black holes devouring star systems.

02:57.520 --> 03:02.040
And we may have glimpsed
the origin of the cosmos itself.

03:04.920 --> 03:08.760
With every new observation,
with every new piece of knowledge,

03:08.840 --> 03:12.680
there is the opportunity to acquire
a deeper understanding.

03:12.760 --> 03:15.840
And, as we answer
question after question

03:15.920 --> 03:18.480
we get ever closer to being able to tell

03:18.560 --> 03:22.560
what is surely
the greatest story ever told.

04:09.240 --> 04:11.880
NASA's Parker Solar Probe,

04:11.960 --> 04:13.960
a daring mission to shed light

04:15.480 --> 04:19.200
on the mysteries of our closest star.

04:29.400 --> 04:34.640
This is a journey
into never-never land you might say.

04:44.160 --> 04:50.680
NASA's Parker Solar Probe is
the first spacecraft to touch a star.

05:15.400 --> 05:18.840
It's designed to fly
through the Sun's atmosphere,

05:21.240 --> 05:25.080
braving temperatures
no spacecraft has ever endured.

05:54.360 --> 05:58.240
The Parker Solar Probe is
allowing us to know our star

05:58.880 --> 06:00.480
as we've never known it before.

06:05.640 --> 06:10.400
And it's also helping us
to tell the story of all the stars.

06:20.080 --> 06:25.040
Our Sun is from a long line of stars
dating back to the dawn of time.

06:27.320 --> 06:29.360
From fierce blue giants

06:30.960 --> 06:33.160
which first lit up the universe,

06:36.240 --> 06:38.080
to later generations,

06:40.520 --> 06:44.160
whose deaths enriched the cosmos
with precious elements,

06:49.160 --> 06:51.480
the building blocks of our solar system,

06:58.800 --> 07:04.360
and allowed our Sun to create the thing
which brings meaning to the cosmos.

07:12.120 --> 07:13.360
Life.

07:14.680 --> 07:17.080
You and me.

07:57.000 --> 08:00.080
We have
a strange relationship with the stars,

08:00.160 --> 08:03.480
somewhere between awe and indifference.

08:05.160 --> 08:07.800
I think we take our star,
the Sun, for granted,

08:07.880 --> 08:09.800
partly because of its predictability.

08:09.880 --> 08:13.440
Every day it rises in the east
and sets in the west,

08:15.600 --> 08:19.440
without any help or reverence from us.

08:24.040 --> 08:27.160
But many ancient cultures deified
the Sun.

08:27.920 --> 08:29.680
They treated it as a God,

08:30.480 --> 08:34.840
and the Sun gods were creators
and destroyers of worlds.

08:35.480 --> 08:37.040
So which is it?

08:38.080 --> 08:43.640
Well, I think that the modern story
of the stars as told by science,

08:43.720 --> 08:46.400
which is indisputably an epic story

08:46.480 --> 08:50.920
stretching back over 13 billion years
to the origin of the universe,

08:51.000 --> 08:54.560
places them firmly
in the realm of the gods.

09:06.160 --> 09:09.400
If we want to understand
where these gods came from...

09:11.520 --> 09:12.960
We have to go back...

09:18.480 --> 09:21.080
to a time before the stars.

09:50.560 --> 09:54.800
In the beginning the universe was dark.

10:00.720 --> 10:03.040
But it was not empty.

10:07.280 --> 10:10.080
Something was lurking in the void,

10:13.320 --> 10:15.440
stretching out tendrils.

10:37.760 --> 10:41.600
The cosmic web grew
to become a vast structure,

10:46.880 --> 10:49.160
criss-crossing the entire universe.

10:54.520 --> 10:58.520
It was formed by interlocking filaments
of dark matter,

11:04.160 --> 11:06.880
and it was at the places
where these filaments met

11:10.080 --> 11:11.640
the intersections,

11:18.120 --> 11:24.520
that the first stars,
our Sun's earliest ancestors, were born.

12:01.080 --> 12:04.200
The cosmic web is
the scaffolding of the universe,

12:05.400 --> 12:09.520
the vast and intricate structure
that spans the void.

12:15.080 --> 12:18.120
The web is made
primarily out of dark matter,

12:18.200 --> 12:22.000
a mysterious substance
that dominates the universe,

12:22.080 --> 12:24.720
although we don't know what it is.

12:24.800 --> 12:26.800
It's one of the great mysteries
in modern physics.

12:26.880 --> 12:32.600
It's probably some kind of particle
that interacts very weakly with itself

12:32.680 --> 12:34.320
and with light.

12:34.400 --> 12:36.080
If it doesn't interact with light,

12:36.160 --> 12:38.440
we can't see it, which is
why it's called dark matter.

12:40.720 --> 12:45.040
But it does influence the universe
through its gravity.

12:49.800 --> 12:52.480
It was in the dark heart
of the cosmic web

12:53.120 --> 12:56.360
that gravity began to sculpt
the early universe,

13:00.200 --> 13:03.280
drawing together
the two simplest elements,

13:03.360 --> 13:05.400
hydrogen and helium.

13:07.320 --> 13:11.080
The raw material
for the very first stars.

13:14.440 --> 13:18.600
Hydrogen gas clings
to the filaments of the web,

13:18.720 --> 13:21.000
attracted there
by the gravitational pull

13:21.080 --> 13:22.440
of the dark matter.

13:23.800 --> 13:26.280
And where those filaments cross,

13:26.360 --> 13:30.760
the gas can become dense enough
to collapse under its own gravity

13:30.840 --> 13:35.520
to form great clusters of galaxies,
each filled with billions of stars.

13:52.360 --> 13:55.360
The universe was
approaching a turning point.

13:57.280 --> 13:59.960
Hydrogen and helium poured
into the regions

14:00.040 --> 14:01.720
where the filaments crossed,

14:04.520 --> 14:07.000
gathering into ever denser clouds.

14:12.000 --> 14:14.280
Gravity asserted its grip,

14:17.520 --> 14:20.440
and the clouds of gas began to collapse,

14:25.400 --> 14:28.000
becoming denser and denser.

14:31.400 --> 14:33.760
And in the densest regions,

14:33.840 --> 14:35.800
the gas became so hot...

14:38.320 --> 14:41.080
that nuclear fusion reactions began.

15:03.000 --> 15:04.720
And out of maelstrom,

15:05.960 --> 15:08.840
the first gods emerged,

15:11.680 --> 15:13.240
and there was light.

16:00.360 --> 16:02.960
The stars illuminate the universe,

16:03.920 --> 16:07.680
but that is the least interesting thing
that they do.

16:09.560 --> 16:11.400
The thing that makes
the universe interesting,

16:11.480 --> 16:17.640
that brings meaning to the universe is
that, life. You and me.

16:17.720 --> 16:20.640
And life is just chemistry.

16:20.720 --> 16:24.560
And chemistry requires
complex chemical elements.

16:24.640 --> 16:27.720
The only thing that existed
in the universe before the stars

16:27.800 --> 16:29.800
was hydrogen and helium.

16:29.880 --> 16:33.360
Life requires carbon
and oxygen and iron.

16:33.440 --> 16:37.440
All those things were made
in a process called nuclear fusion

16:37.520 --> 16:39.200
in the cores of stars,

16:39.280 --> 16:43.920
or even the heavier elements,
like gold, in the collisions of stars.

16:44.000 --> 16:48.880
So, without the stars,
the universe would be uninteresting.

16:48.960 --> 16:50.720
It would be meaningless.

16:50.800 --> 16:54.320
It would be just an infinite box of gas.

17:07.040 --> 17:09.280
The first stars were monsters.

17:17.960 --> 17:20.800
Hundreds of times as massive as our Sun.

17:25.800 --> 17:30.000
They burnt with such ferocity
that they shone blue,

17:33.960 --> 17:38.560
with surface temperatures
in excess of 100,000 degrees.

17:42.640 --> 17:45.840
They were the largest stars ever
to have lived.

17:47.680 --> 17:50.400
Violent and volatile giants.

18:00.680 --> 18:03.400
A star is essentially a balancing act.

18:03.480 --> 18:07.200
The force of gravity is
constantly trying to collapse it,

18:07.280 --> 18:09.480
and that pushes its ingredients,

18:09.560 --> 18:13.640
primarily hydrogen, single protons,
closer and closer together.

18:14.120 --> 18:17.120
Now, when those protons
get close enough together,

18:17.200 --> 18:19.520
another of the fundamental forces
of nature,

18:19.600 --> 18:22.480
the strong nuclear force, takes over,

18:22.560 --> 18:24.640
and it can stick the protons together.

18:24.720 --> 18:29.800
That releases energy which creates
a pressure which holds the star up.

18:29.880 --> 18:34.120
Now the more massive the star,
the stronger the inward pull of gravity

18:34.200 --> 18:37.880
and the more energy has to be released
to maintain the balance,

18:37.960 --> 18:40.880
and so the faster
the ingredients are used up.

19:01.400 --> 19:04.720
These giant stars were
in a struggle for survival,

19:06.280 --> 19:09.320
fighting the relentless pull of gravity,

19:13.880 --> 19:17.240
consuming more and more hydrogen fuel

19:17.320 --> 19:20.280
to maintain
their precarious equilibrium.

19:37.360 --> 19:40.280
For most of its life,
a star burns hydrogen,

19:40.360 --> 19:43.560
the simplest chemical element
with one proton in its nucleus,

19:44.240 --> 19:46.640
into helium with two protons.

19:47.720 --> 19:50.040
Now, when it runs out
of hydrogen in the core,

19:50.120 --> 19:53.000
the core starts to collapse and heat up,

19:53.080 --> 19:57.960
and the star responds by building
ever more complex elements.

19:58.040 --> 20:02.080
So it makes carbon with six protons
and oxygen with eight protons,

20:02.160 --> 20:04.920
releasing more
and more energy as it goes.

20:08.080 --> 20:11.520
But when the star has
assembled iron in its core,

20:11.600 --> 20:14.160
with 26 protons in its nucleus,

20:14.240 --> 20:17.000
no more energy can be released.

20:17.120 --> 20:20.400
The star loses
its battle against gravity.

20:20.480 --> 20:25.640
It collapses
and in a final moment of creation,

20:25.760 --> 20:28.560
salvaged if you like,
from its destruction,

20:28.640 --> 20:32.480
it distributes those newly minted
heavy chemical elements

20:32.560 --> 20:34.720
out into the universe.

20:49.840 --> 20:53.360
Imagine we could journey back in time

20:53.440 --> 20:58.680
and watch the first star live out
its brief luminous life.

21:19.360 --> 21:24.880
After only a million years
the star used up all of its fuel.

21:36.000 --> 21:37.800
The core collapsed.

21:52.920 --> 21:55.000
The star imploded.

22:07.440 --> 22:09.040
And then rebounded...

22:10.240 --> 22:12.120
in a colossal explosion.

22:13.600 --> 22:15.000
A supernova.

22:37.280 --> 22:41.800
In death, the first stars began
to transform the cosmos,

22:45.360 --> 22:48.760
enriching the ocean
of hydrogen and helium

22:48.840 --> 22:52.560
which filled the universe
with heavy elements...

22:55.040 --> 22:59.280
to build new generations
of more complex stars.

23:08.080 --> 23:11.680
Over time,
these elements gathered together,

23:20.280 --> 23:24.040
creating rich clouds of gas and dust.

23:33.280 --> 23:38.360
Nurseries where new generations
of stars were born.

23:44.760 --> 23:48.840
And not just stars,
but families of stars.

23:51.200 --> 23:52.840
The first galaxies.

24:00.480 --> 24:01.680
And around this time,

24:02.560 --> 24:09.160
some of the earliest star systems
formed in our own galaxy, the Milky Way.

24:20.280 --> 24:23.960
A new age of complexity was
dawning in the universe.

24:26.720 --> 24:29.560
Now, there were stars
of different sizes,

24:35.640 --> 24:37.160
and different colours.

24:51.320 --> 24:55.320
And crucially new bodies had appeared.

25:04.400 --> 25:05.760
Planets.

25:07.800 --> 25:14.200
Places where the rich chemical elements
built by previous generations of stars

25:14.760 --> 25:17.840
could finally find a home.

25:33.600 --> 25:35.920
Countless billions of stars
have come and gone

25:36.000 --> 25:39.840
since those first giants
illuminated the darkness.

25:39.920 --> 25:42.280
Each enriching the universe

25:42.360 --> 25:45.560
with the material
out of which the next generation formed.

25:46.240 --> 25:50.240
Blue stars and white stars,
single stars, double stars,

25:50.320 --> 25:53.760
even triple star systems orbiting
around each other.

25:57.080 --> 25:59.000
The conditions were now right

25:59.080 --> 26:02.120
for those stars to drive the universe

26:02.200 --> 26:05.400
into a new and profound age
of complexity.

26:35.080 --> 26:39.520
Our Sun was formed from the ashes
of generations of ancestors.

26:54.480 --> 27:00.280
Just one small star in a galaxy
of billions of brilliant gods.

27:09.680 --> 27:14.560
For the first million years of its life,
the Sun was virtually alone,

27:16.880 --> 27:20.280
wreathed in clouds of gas and dust.

27:23.520 --> 27:26.080
The dust slowly clumped together...

27:30.680 --> 27:33.280
forming clusters the size of pebbles.

27:36.600 --> 27:38.440
Then, boulders.

27:45.120 --> 27:46.600
And finally...

27:48.560 --> 27:49.800
planets.

27:56.160 --> 27:58.560
But the planets were lifeless rocks.

28:06.080 --> 28:11.840
Only the Sun had the power
to turn them into worlds.

28:19.080 --> 28:21.720
Some were too far away from the Sun.

28:35.000 --> 28:36.440
Ice giants,

28:37.800 --> 28:42.120
frozen, seemingly into infertility.

28:46.960 --> 28:49.640
Others formed too close to the Sun,

28:52.600 --> 28:55.360
seared by a relentless light.

28:58.360 --> 29:01.440
They became scorched desert worlds.

29:05.000 --> 29:08.040
But there was a planet
in the Sun's family

29:09.960 --> 29:15.200
that, quite by chance, formed
neither too close nor too far away.

29:21.840 --> 29:27.640
An Arcadia, where our star could
breathe life into dust.

29:52.560 --> 29:56.440
The planets are just the leftovers
from the formation of stars.

29:56.520 --> 29:58.840
Debris, if you like.

30:00.200 --> 30:04.440
They're just little specks orbiting
around those magnificent flames.

30:06.760 --> 30:10.320
But the planets are also
the places in the universe

30:10.400 --> 30:13.680
where gravity has concentrated
the heavy elements built

30:13.760 --> 30:16.480
by previous generations of stars.

30:16.560 --> 30:21.440
And that makes the planets the canvas
on which the stars can create.

30:24.240 --> 30:27.760
"The canvas on which the stars can
create." What do I mean by that?

30:27.840 --> 30:29.360
Well, just look around.

30:29.440 --> 30:32.520
Everywhere you look on Earth
there is complexity.

30:32.600 --> 30:37.120
Not only mountains and rivers,
but living things, animals and plants,

30:37.200 --> 30:39.800
human beings, human civilisation,

30:39.880 --> 30:43.920
the most complex thing we know of
anywhere in the universe.

30:44.000 --> 30:45.960
So, you have to ask yourself

30:46.040 --> 30:49.640
how can it be
that such complexity can emerge

30:49.720 --> 30:52.560
completely naturally in the universe?

30:57.600 --> 31:02.080
Well the answer, in fact was
known in the 19th century

31:02.160 --> 31:04.880
and it comes from the science
of thermodynamics.

31:07.800 --> 31:08.960
In the 19th century,

31:09.040 --> 31:11.480
people were interested
in the efficiency of steam engines,

31:11.560 --> 31:16.040
and steam engines are, after all,
the machines that powered the factories

31:16.120 --> 31:19.600
that allowed people to build
increasingly complex things.

31:20.080 --> 31:24.160
And it turns out that the only thing
that matters for a steam engine,

31:24.240 --> 31:26.320
the thing
that determines its efficiency,

31:26.400 --> 31:30.000
the thing that allows it
to do work and build things

31:30.080 --> 31:33.600
is the temperature difference
between the fire,

31:33.680 --> 31:36.520
the furnace
at the heart of the steam engine,

31:36.600 --> 31:39.800
and the cold environment surrounding it.

31:41.960 --> 31:46.800
In the universe, the stars are
hot spots in a cold sky.

31:46.880 --> 31:52.080
We are sitting, in a very real sense,
inside a giant steam engine,

31:52.160 --> 31:54.680
powered by the furnace of the Sun.

31:56.360 --> 31:58.280
And it's in that sense

31:58.360 --> 32:03.480
that the stars are the creators
of complexity in the universe.

32:07.520 --> 32:11.160
But creating complexity is a subtle art.

32:14.120 --> 32:19.560
You need an engine, in this case a star,
that's not too wild and flashy.

32:24.440 --> 32:29.120
A star which is
consistent enough for long enough

32:29.200 --> 32:31.320
to kindle the sparks of life,

32:37.240 --> 32:41.400
and allow those sparks
to flicker and flourish.

32:54.360 --> 32:59.760
The most important property of a star,
if it's to nurture a civilisation...

33:01.800 --> 33:05.080
is magnificent dependability.

33:30.040 --> 33:33.920
No one knows exactly
how life on Earth emerged.

33:41.120 --> 33:44.720
But what we do know is
that at some point

33:44.800 --> 33:50.240
primitive cells living in the ocean
began using the Sun's energy

33:50.320 --> 33:53.640
to power life-giving chemical reactions.

33:56.240 --> 34:01.440
These cells formed a bridge
between Earth and Sun.

34:03.480 --> 34:07.760
Delicate engines
which harness the fires of our star,

34:09.480 --> 34:15.240
using sunlight to turn
carbon dioxide and water into food.

34:21.920 --> 34:28.560
This process, known as photosynthesis,
unleashed the Sun's creative power,

34:42.760 --> 34:46.040
and drove the evolution of complexity.

34:54.720 --> 34:56.640
From primitive bacteria,

34:57.680 --> 35:00.480
to plants and trees...

35:12.840 --> 35:16.880
and ultimately, to you and me.

35:20.840 --> 35:22.560
You know, photosynthesis is a process

35:22.640 --> 35:25.120
that's very easy to describe in words.

35:25.680 --> 35:27.640
The plants take energy from the Sun,

35:28.760 --> 35:32.440
then use it to react carbon dioxide
and water together

35:32.520 --> 35:35.920
to make sugars
and a waste product, oxygen.

35:36.000 --> 35:39.360
Really easy to say.
Very difficult to do.

35:39.440 --> 35:42.920
There's a part
of that photosynthetic machinery

35:43.000 --> 35:44.640
in everything you see here.

35:44.720 --> 35:47.600
Every plant on the planet has
got Photosystem II.

35:47.680 --> 35:52.840
It's comprised of 46,630 atoms

35:52.920 --> 35:56.480
all working together
in an intricate machine.

35:56.600 --> 36:00.440
Very efficient.
It took billions of years of evolution.

36:01.080 --> 36:02.440
Then we eat the plants,

36:02.520 --> 36:05.120
or we eat something
that's eaten the plants

36:05.200 --> 36:07.760
and we do the reverse reaction.

36:07.840 --> 36:12.440
We take those sugars and we breathe in
that waste product, oxygen.

36:12.520 --> 36:14.680
React them together,
release a bit of energy,

36:14.760 --> 36:17.200
a bit of the stored sunlight
if you like,

36:17.280 --> 36:22.920
and we use that energy to maintain
our structure, to grow, to live.

36:30.520 --> 36:34.120
Trillions of stars have existed
since the universe began.

36:39.120 --> 36:43.680
But ours has nurtured
that most miraculous thing,

36:45.280 --> 36:46.440
life.

36:49.960 --> 36:54.480
And that makes the Sun
a truly remarkable star.

37:03.160 --> 37:06.040
That is the only star
we know of anywhere

37:06.120 --> 37:10.720
where there are collections of atoms
in orbit around it, you and me,

37:10.800 --> 37:15.080
that have named it The Sun. Our Sun.

37:15.160 --> 37:18.880
We worshipped it, deified it
since the dawn of history.

37:18.960 --> 37:22.200
In fact, it's been argued
that the Sun lies at the foundation

37:22.280 --> 37:26.680
of all religion, and there may be
some truth in that.

37:26.760 --> 37:29.800
In fact, I think
there is a deep truth in that

37:29.880 --> 37:32.520
because we all owe our existence,

37:32.600 --> 37:37.000
this brief time we have
in the universe to that star.

37:37.080 --> 37:40.400
In fact, in a deeper sense
to all the stars.

37:40.480 --> 37:45.800
We don't need to invent
imaginary gods to explain the universe.

37:45.880 --> 37:48.720
We can replace them with the real thing.

38:02.600 --> 38:04.160
Everyone we love.

38:09.880 --> 38:12.120
Everything we value.

38:15.040 --> 38:19.720
Our supreme accomplishments
as a civilisation...

38:23.480 --> 38:26.400
were created and crafted...

38:30.080 --> 38:31.360
by stars.

38:51.240 --> 38:55.480
There are over 200 billion stars
in our galaxy.

39:00.520 --> 39:05.080
And there are two trillion galaxies
in the observable universe.

39:14.480 --> 39:16.840
We're living in the age of stars.

39:27.760 --> 39:31.120
An era of light and life in the cosmos.

39:37.280 --> 39:39.920
From our fleeting human perspective,

39:40.720 --> 39:42.800
stars seem eternal.

40:02.680 --> 40:06.520
But even gods are not immortal.

40:10.840 --> 40:12.720
Where there is light,

40:15.320 --> 40:16.760
there is darkness.

40:21.880 --> 40:23.640
Stars are creators,

40:29.560 --> 40:32.920
but they can be jealous guardians
of their creations.

40:38.320 --> 40:43.360
Many smaller stars don't die
in spectacular explosions.

40:45.200 --> 40:49.800
Instead, they slowly fade away.

40:51.680 --> 40:55.600
They hang on
to the precious elements they made,

40:57.720 --> 40:59.480
becoming fossil stars.

41:04.040 --> 41:06.720
And as more fossils litter the universe,

41:09.400 --> 41:13.040
more life giving elements
remain locked away,

41:15.720 --> 41:17.960
starving the cosmos

41:18.040 --> 41:21.960
of the material needed to make
new generations of stars.

41:39.880 --> 41:42.840
The age of stars may seem infinite,

41:45.120 --> 41:46.640
but it had a beginning,

41:48.400 --> 41:50.880
and it will also have an end.

41:54.680 --> 41:57.600
Imagine a timeline of the universe

41:57.680 --> 42:00.640
and imagine that this is
the origin of the universe,

42:00.720 --> 42:03.520
the big bang 13.8 billion years ago.

42:04.240 --> 42:08.040
After 100 million years or so,
the first stars formed.

42:08.120 --> 42:13.120
On this scale, one centimetre is
about 20 million years.

42:13.200 --> 42:17.800
After four billion years the peak rate
of star formation occurred.

42:17.880 --> 42:21.360
The maximum number
of new stars were born.

42:21.440 --> 42:26.120
After nine billion years,
our sun was born.

42:26.960 --> 42:31.560
And, today, we stand
13.8 billion years later,

42:31.640 --> 42:34.680
about halfway through
the lifetime of our sun.

42:35.600 --> 42:38.160
Now, in about five billion years' time,

42:38.240 --> 42:41.600
our sun will die
but new stars will be born,

42:42.200 --> 42:44.600
and many of the older stars
in the universe,

42:44.680 --> 42:47.800
the smaller stars, will
continue to shine.

42:47.880 --> 42:52.440
In fact, we think that the last star
will cease to shine,

42:52.520 --> 42:57.120
the universe will go dark,
in around ten trillion years.

42:58.760 --> 43:01.760
On this scale,
that's about 5000 metres away

43:01.840 --> 43:03.520
from the big bang.

43:04.040 --> 43:05.600
But that's not the end of the universe.

43:05.680 --> 43:11.080
As far as we know, the universe will
continue expanding forever.

43:11.600 --> 43:16.760
And so, the age of starlight is
the briefest moment of time

43:16.840 --> 43:19.000
in the infinite history of the universe.

43:19.080 --> 43:24.480
The age of darkness will go on
and on and on.

43:31.160 --> 43:34.120
Stars won't just disappear, of course.

43:37.040 --> 43:39.920
They'll be here for aeons to come.

43:43.480 --> 43:45.720
But over time,

43:45.800 --> 43:51.720
the universe will grow darker,
colder and emptier.

44:02.160 --> 44:03.920
There are stars around today

44:04.000 --> 44:07.800
that existed close to the beginning
of the age of stars.

44:16.480 --> 44:20.280
And some of them will
also witness the end.

44:24.920 --> 44:28.160
They're the longest-lived stars
in the universe.

44:30.080 --> 44:31.360
Red Dwarfs.

44:39.960 --> 44:42.720
Trappist-1 is one of these ancients.

44:50.000 --> 44:53.280
It's already more than
seven billion years old.

44:54.720 --> 44:56.880
Almost twice as old as our sun.

45:06.520 --> 45:09.920
But only around a tenth of the size,

45:15.920 --> 45:18.760
and less than one percent as bright.

45:22.720 --> 45:24.360
It's a cool star.

45:26.160 --> 45:27.680
Slow burning.

45:33.720 --> 45:36.800
And that is the secret of its longevity.

45:41.880 --> 45:43.600
Because they burn slowly,

45:44.960 --> 45:48.080
Red Dwarfs live for a very long time,

45:54.880 --> 45:58.240
far longer than any other star.

46:04.120 --> 46:07.680
Like the sun, Trappist-1 has
its own planets.

46:09.840 --> 46:11.880
Seven rocky worlds,

46:14.760 --> 46:17.200
each roughly the size of Earth.

46:21.680 --> 46:26.080
Some may have atmospheres,
and even oceans.

46:35.320 --> 46:37.840
But there the similarity ends,

46:49.800 --> 46:52.200
because these are strange worlds.

46:55.240 --> 46:58.960
Every one of these planets
is locked in its orbit

47:01.080 --> 47:03.760
one side facing Trappist-1,

47:05.760 --> 47:07.680
the other side frozen,

47:07.760 --> 47:11.760
permanently exposed
to the cold void of space.

47:24.040 --> 47:27.880
If you could stand on the surface
of one of these ancient worlds,

47:34.520 --> 47:37.000
as the aeons passed,

47:41.160 --> 47:46.040
you could watch the future
of the cosmos slowly unfold.

47:56.240 --> 48:01.240
And, one day,
five billion years from now,

48:03.720 --> 48:07.080
you'd see our sun flicker

48:08.360 --> 48:11.720
and fade away forever.

48:40.120 --> 48:43.240
The death of our sun will
probably go unremarked.

48:46.000 --> 48:47.960
I doubt that we'll be around to see it.

48:48.040 --> 48:51.920
Maybe some alien astronomer,
on a world far away

48:52.000 --> 48:53.800
across the milky way, will see it

48:53.880 --> 48:55.960
through the end of their telescope

48:56.040 --> 48:57.936
but I don't think
they'll give it a second thought.

48:57.960 --> 49:02.640
I mean, we've seen hundreds of stars die
and we don't give them a second thought.

49:02.720 --> 49:07.640
But, I think the death of our sun will
matter here, locally,

49:07.720 --> 49:10.480
in this little corner of the galaxy,

49:10.560 --> 49:13.480
because it will mark the end
of a glorious time

49:13.560 --> 49:15.000
in the history of our galaxy,

49:15.160 --> 49:19.040
where meaning,
where science and literature

49:19.120 --> 49:22.320
and art and poetry
and music existed here.

49:22.960 --> 49:24.240
And that does matter.

49:28.240 --> 49:30.520
Why does meaning have to be eternal?

49:30.600 --> 49:34.840
It's the fragility of our lives
that makes them valuable.

49:40.200 --> 49:43.560
I think the wonderful thing is
that our star has

49:43.640 --> 49:47.880
taken the laws of nature,
here on this planet,

49:47.960 --> 49:51.680
and crafted such
a magnificent expression of them.

49:51.760 --> 49:53.440
You and me,

49:54.960 --> 49:56.200
and all this.

50:24.680 --> 50:29.840
Stars like Trappist-I will linger on
long after the death of our sun.

50:37.960 --> 50:41.400
We will never know the name
of the last star.

50:49.080 --> 50:50.480
But we know

50:51.520 --> 50:53.680
that the last star to shine

50:55.560 --> 50:57.000
will be a Red Dwarf.

51:04.240 --> 51:06.840
The last star will slowly cool...

51:10.800 --> 51:12.080
and fade away.

51:26.080 --> 51:28.680
With its passing
the universe will become,

51:29.520 --> 51:32.240
once again, a void,

51:37.320 --> 51:38.720
without light,

51:41.120 --> 51:42.240
or life,

51:45.640 --> 51:46.800
or meaning.

52:05.720 --> 52:07.680
The stars illuminate the universe

52:07.760 --> 52:10.200
and create
its most intricate structures.

52:14.600 --> 52:17.280
And, one day, they will all be gone.

52:21.360 --> 52:24.960
The stars are gods,
but they're mortal gods.

52:25.360 --> 52:28.600
And, when that time comes
and the last stars have faded,

52:28.680 --> 52:34.320
and all possibility of life and meaning
in the universe has faded with them,

52:34.400 --> 52:37.520
they will have left
the most profound legacy.

52:37.600 --> 52:42.040
Because, for a moment
in the long history of the universe,

52:42.120 --> 52:45.120
the stars illuminated the dark,

52:45.200 --> 52:48.280
and allowed us to illuminate it, too.

53:22.560 --> 53:26.920
We want to study the sun
because it teaches us a lot about stars.

53:27.000 --> 53:30.960
It teaches us a lot about all the other
millions and billions of stars

53:31.040 --> 53:32.680
in our galaxy and beyond.

53:40.960 --> 53:42.320
There was a moment,

53:42.400 --> 53:44.096
when we were putting
the spacecraft together,

53:44.120 --> 53:46.096
that I just took a moment
and looked at the spacecraft

53:46.120 --> 53:47.360
and realised,

53:47.440 --> 53:49.760
this is going into a star,

53:50.440 --> 53:53.960
and to realise how special it was

53:54.240 --> 53:56.640
to be able to have worked on this,

53:56.720 --> 54:00.680
and that humanity decided this was
something we wanted to do.

54:01.480 --> 54:03.600
- Minus 30.
- Status check.

54:03.920 --> 54:06.280
- Pro delta.
- Go PSP.

54:06.840 --> 54:08.000
Minus 15.

54:08.160 --> 54:10.760
Launch night,
I was sick to my stomach.

54:11.200 --> 54:16.640
Five, four, three, two,
one, zero.

54:17.520 --> 54:19.600
Lift-off of the mighty Delta IV...

54:19.680 --> 54:23.160
...Heavy Rocket
with NASA's Parker Solar Probe.

54:23.240 --> 54:25.480
There we go.

54:25.560 --> 54:27.000
The spacecraft is the first

54:27.080 --> 54:29.080
that NASA has named
after a living person,

54:29.480 --> 54:31.280
because Eugene Parker is

54:31.360 --> 54:33.720
really such, you know,
an eminent physicist in our field.

54:36.080 --> 54:39.040
The Delta IV Heavy
is a very slow rocket

54:39.120 --> 54:41.120
compared to the other launches
I've seen,

54:41.240 --> 54:43.120
so I just saw fireballs,

54:43.200 --> 54:46.160
and was very,
very frightened for a while.

54:46.240 --> 54:47.840
Twenty-five seconds
into flight.

54:50.200 --> 54:52.760
Temp and pressures continue to look good
on all three boosters.

54:52.920 --> 54:56.720
Then realising that this was all okay
as it slowly made its way up

54:56.800 --> 54:58.080
into the sky.

54:59.160 --> 55:00.840
Now 50 seconds into flight.

55:07.360 --> 55:10.280
Parker Solar Probe is
so revolutionary

55:10.360 --> 55:13.920
because it's the first time that we're
actually going in to touch the sun.

55:15.520 --> 55:17.600
We're going 94 % of the way

55:17.680 --> 55:19.480
from the Earth to the sun

55:19.560 --> 55:23.400
to actually experience the solar corona,
the sun's atmosphere.

55:24.640 --> 55:26.880
I think, at closest approach,

55:26.960 --> 55:30.000
it'll be about eight solar radii
from the Sun

55:30.080 --> 55:32.920
which is just mind-blowingly close.

55:36.600 --> 55:39.720
So, we were expecting
things to be very hot,

55:39.840 --> 55:42.800
over 2,500 Fahrenheit,

55:42.880 --> 55:46.080
but in a soup
of a million degree plasma.

55:50.560 --> 55:52.136
That's a real challenge
for the spacecraft

55:52.160 --> 55:53.640
to survive that environment.

55:53.880 --> 55:54.920
So, in order to do that,

55:55.000 --> 55:57.920
there's a very large heat shield
on the front of the spacecraft

55:58.000 --> 56:00.440
which protects
the majority of the instruments

56:00.520 --> 56:02.720
which are sat behind
on the spacecraft body.

56:05.040 --> 56:07.680
What makes
Parker so great is the fact

56:07.760 --> 56:09.320
that it has a set of instruments

56:09.400 --> 56:12.480
that work together
in order to look in all directions

56:12.560 --> 56:16.000
in order to solve those big mysteries
about the solar wind.

56:23.320 --> 56:27.080
The solar corona has been mysterious
to us since we've known about it,

56:27.160 --> 56:28.640
so it's a very strange thing.

56:28.720 --> 56:32.520
The surface of the sun is
sort of 6,000 degrees

56:32.600 --> 56:35.160
and then, above that, you have
this very thin atmosphere

56:35.240 --> 56:36.640
that's a million degrees.

56:36.720 --> 56:37.840
Super-hot.

56:37.920 --> 56:39.840
And the way that's heated,

56:39.920 --> 56:42.360
we know it has something to do
with magnetic fields

56:42.440 --> 56:44.520
but we don't know exactly how it works.

56:44.640 --> 56:46.640
That's where
the solar wind is generated.

56:46.720 --> 56:48.680
We don't know quite exactly
how that works either.

56:51.080 --> 56:54.680
Other things that have
come out of this are

56:54.760 --> 56:56.480
coronal mass ejections.

56:56.560 --> 56:59.080
When we originally did the proposal,

56:59.160 --> 57:02.520
we were thinking that we would see five
in the entire seven-year mission,

57:02.600 --> 57:04.160
if we were lucky.

57:06.040 --> 57:08.840
We ended up seeing around
four to five in the first year.

57:10.640 --> 57:13.880
So, there has been just a total switch

57:13.960 --> 57:17.360
in terms of how active the sun is

57:17.440 --> 57:19.480
or what we classify
as coronal mass ejections.

57:19.560 --> 57:20.880
Maybe a little bit of both.

57:27.160 --> 57:30.400
It is a joy to see
all the data coming back.

57:30.480 --> 57:32.760
It's a joy to share it with others

57:32.840 --> 57:36.760
and to see them be as curious
as I have been for the last decade.

57:40.440 --> 57:42.320
So, Parker has just begun
its mission really,

57:42.400 --> 57:43.800
and it's already really started

57:43.880 --> 57:46.680
to truly transform our understanding
for how the sun works.
