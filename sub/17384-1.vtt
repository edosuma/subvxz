03:04.710 --> 03:07.520
What are you doing out here?

03:07.520 --> 03:08.880
I'm lost.

03:08.890 --> 03:10.690
This is a restricted area.

03:10.690 --> 03:13.020
Oh, I didn't know that.
There's no signs.

03:13.020 --> 03:14.790
They're everywhere.

03:14.790 --> 03:17.120
Let's see some ID.

03:17.130 --> 03:18.830
Why?

03:18.830 --> 03:21.630
There's a broken gate back
there, and you're trespassing.

03:21.630 --> 03:23.700
Excuse me, sir,
that gate was open

03:23.700 --> 03:25.670
and I was under the opinion
that this was a detour.

03:25.670 --> 03:27.840
Let me see the ID. Take it out.

03:27.840 --> 03:29.300
What kind of uniform is that?

03:29.310 --> 03:32.370
I'll ask the fucking questions.

03:32.380 --> 03:34.880
It's a private outfit, huh?

03:34.880 --> 03:37.650
I tried to get one of those jobs.
I like guarding things.

03:37.650 --> 03:39.080
Really?

03:40.150 --> 03:41.250
Here you go, sir.

03:41.250 --> 03:42.520
I think what must have happened

03:42.520 --> 03:45.290
is I just must have
gotten turned around.

03:51.160 --> 03:53.330
<i> Is it in the high-end
or the low-end range?</i>

03:53.330 --> 03:54.700
<i> Oh, there's no
question it's up!</i>

03:54.700 --> 03:56.400
<i> Yes, but 20%?</i>

03:56.400 --> 03:59.170
<i> Foreclosure,
foreclosure, foreclosure!</i>

03:59.170 --> 04:01.500
<i> We're talking about over
two-thirds of the market,</i>

04:01.500 --> 04:03.270
<i> and, of course, it's
linked to unemployment.</i>

04:03.270 --> 04:05.010
<i> So, the opportunity
for the average</i>

04:05.010 --> 04:06.840
<i> investor with the
right know-how...</i>

04:06.840 --> 04:09.210
<i> Is all in the book.
In the seminars.</i>

04:09.210 --> 04:11.110
<i> Very little doubt?</i>

04:11.110 --> 04:12.510
<i> Yes, their</i> <i> distress sales makes
them</i> <i> want them off the books.</i>

04:12.520 --> 04:13.850
<i> Oh...</i>

04:13.850 --> 04:17.019
<i> They need to sell them.
They have to, right?</i>

04:19.560 --> 04:21.690
<i> ...you name it,
we teach them all.</i>

04:21.690 --> 04:22.890
<i> I guesstimate</i>

04:22.890 --> 04:25.230
that I have about 50
pounds of copper wire,

04:25.230 --> 04:26.460
100 pounds of chain-link fence

04:26.460 --> 04:29.130
and two manhole covers.
The nice thick ones.

04:29.130 --> 04:31.230
I'll give 50 cents a
pound for the wire,

04:31.230 --> 04:32.970
15 for the fence, and
10 for the covers.

04:32.970 --> 04:34.740
That's below market value.

04:34.740 --> 04:36.270
Market value?

04:36.270 --> 04:39.110
You know the cops came by
asking about manhole covers?

04:39.110 --> 04:42.140
I'd like to counter at a
dollar a pound for the copper,

04:42.150 --> 04:44.110
30 cents a pound for the fence,

04:44.110 --> 04:45.980
and 20 cents per
for the covers.

04:45.980 --> 04:47.450
Ah, sell them somewhere else.

04:47.450 --> 04:49.620
I'd feel good at
75, 25, and 15.

04:49.620 --> 04:51.220
I'm not negotiating with you.

04:51.220 --> 04:52.720
I think we're close. I'm done.

05:00.300 --> 05:02.630
I'm willing to take less to
establish a business relationship.

05:02.630 --> 05:04.970
If that's your last best
offer, then I guess I accept.

05:04.970 --> 05:06.400
All right. Drive around
back and unload them.

05:09.470 --> 05:11.010
Excuse me, sir?

05:12.440 --> 05:14.240
I'm looking for a job.

05:14.240 --> 05:15.680
In fact, I've made up my mind

05:15.680 --> 05:18.110
to find a career that I
can learn and grow into.

05:18.110 --> 05:20.820
Who am I? I'm a hard-worker,
I set high goals

05:20.820 --> 05:22.620
and I've been told
that I am persistent.

05:22.620 --> 05:24.320
Now, I'm not fooling
myself, sir.

05:24.320 --> 05:26.020
Having been raised with
the self-esteem movement

05:26.020 --> 05:27.190
so popular in schools,

05:27.190 --> 05:28.860
I used to expect my
needs to be considered.

05:28.860 --> 05:30.290
But I know that
today's work culture

05:30.290 --> 05:32.160
no longer caters to
the job loyalty that

05:32.160 --> 05:33.990
could be promised to
earlier generations.

05:34.000 --> 05:35.860
What I believe, sir,
is that good things

05:35.870 --> 05:37.670
come to those who
work their asses off.

05:37.670 --> 05:39.030
And that people
such as yourself,

05:39.040 --> 05:41.470
who reach the top of the
mountain, didn't just fall there.

05:41.470 --> 05:43.540
My motto is if you
wanna win the lottery,

05:43.540 --> 05:45.210
you have to make the
money to buy a ticket.

05:46.440 --> 05:48.410
Did I say that I
worked in a garage?

05:50.850 --> 05:54.680
So, what do you say? I could start
tomorrow, or why not tonight?

05:54.680 --> 05:55.680
No.

06:05.130 --> 06:06.460
How about an internship then?

06:06.460 --> 06:07.860
A lot of young
people are taking

06:07.860 --> 06:09.330
unpaid positions to get
a foot in the door.

06:09.330 --> 06:11.130
That's something I'd
be willing to do.

06:11.130 --> 06:12.970
I'm not hiring a fucking thief.

06:46.270 --> 06:48.270
This thing's gonna blow!

06:48.270 --> 06:49.500
Crap! Gotta move!

06:54.040 --> 06:55.240
Help!

07:04.340 --> 07:05.590
This thing is not budging.
Hold on.

07:07.090 --> 07:08.690
I can't move!

07:19.700 --> 07:20.770
Let's go. Let's go!

07:25.370 --> 07:26.540
Let's go!

07:28.740 --> 07:29.880
We're first!

07:29.880 --> 07:32.550
No shit! Get a shot
on the other side!

07:32.550 --> 07:33.650
All right, all right.

07:35.820 --> 07:37.620
Get a shot inside the car.

07:41.390 --> 07:43.260
Go around. Get inside the car.

07:43.260 --> 07:44.560
The fuck am I paying you for?

07:51.170 --> 07:52.470
Yeah, it's free.

07:52.470 --> 07:53.970
Get back, Loder. Get back!

07:53.970 --> 07:55.640
I'm back, I'm back, I'm back!

07:57.440 --> 08:00.710
All units. EMS,
just past exit 31.

08:20.600 --> 08:22.430
Excuse me.

08:22.430 --> 08:24.260
Will this be on television?

08:24.270 --> 08:26.530
Morning news. If it
bleeds, it leads.

08:26.540 --> 08:27.970
What channel?

08:27.970 --> 08:30.800
Whoever pays the most.

08:30.810 --> 08:32.740
What do you get for
something like this?

08:34.280 --> 08:35.510
Not nearly enough.

08:39.679 --> 08:42.380
Enough to buy all that gear.

08:42.390 --> 08:44.179
Let me tell you something.

08:44.190 --> 08:45.690
It's a flaming
asshole of a job.

08:47.220 --> 08:49.760
Can I ask you, are
you currently hiring?

08:50.960 --> 08:53.360
Fuck, no.

08:53.360 --> 08:55.730
Well, thank you for
taking the time

08:55.730 --> 08:57.300

12:06.060 --> 12:07.690
This is a custom
racing bicycle, sir.

12:07.690 --> 12:09.220
Designed for competitive
road cycling.

12:09.230 --> 12:10.760
This bike has a light-weight,

12:10.760 --> 12:12.090
space-age carbon frame

12:12.090 --> 12:14.060
and handlebars positioned
to put the rider

12:14.060 --> 12:15.930
in a more aerodynamic posture.

12:15.930 --> 12:17.830
It also has micro-shifters
and 37 gears,

12:17.830 --> 12:19.070
and weighs under six pounds.

12:19.070 --> 12:21.370
I won the Tour de
Mexico on this bike.

12:21.370 --> 12:23.500
$700 is as high as I'll go.

12:24.710 --> 12:26.440

12:26.440 --> 12:27.670
$700.

12:27.680 --> 12:29.080
$2,500, and that's
giving it away.

12:29.080 --> 12:31.080
No bike has got 37 gears.

12:32.350 --> 12:33.910

No.

Get back. You. Get back.

15:17.610 --> 15:19.080
Get the fuck back now.

15:21.020 --> 15:22.380
Okay.

15:22.380 --> 15:23.920
Shit. All right.

15:23.920 --> 15:26.890
Get back, 100 feet back, now.

15:26.890 --> 15:29.020
You get back, too. 100 feet.

15:30.230 --> 15:31.890
Fucking asshole,
you shut it down.

15:31.890 --> 15:34.030
I had a great fucking angle
back there until you crowded in.

15:34.030 --> 15:36.300
Get the fuck home. There's people
trying to do their fucking job.

15:36.300 --> 15:37.760
Fucking asshole.

15:41.270 --> 15:44.600
Yeah. It's Ace Video. Your lead's
gonna be at First and Western.

15:44.610 --> 15:47.310
Yeah, you wanna get there.
It's a shooting.

15:47.310 --> 15:49.810
Yeah, I got some great footage
of a victim being treated.

15:49.810 --> 15:51.650
No, the LAPD hasn't released it

15:51.650 --> 15:53.310
but a manager at
a Walgreens says

15:53.320 --> 15:54.920
it's a carjacking and
the victim is the owner.

15:54.920 --> 15:56.450
He's Asian and critical.

15:56.450 --> 15:57.980
Right.

15:57.990 --> 15:59.420
Look, I got a 60-second cut

15:59.420 --> 16:00.620
with the manager
and a neighbor.

16:02.090 --> 16:03.460
$500.

16:03.460 --> 16:06.060
Then, make me a deal. $400.

16:06.060 --> 16:07.790
$300. All right, deal.

16:10.270 --> 16:12.500
Are you fucking kidding me?

16:12.500 --> 16:13.800
Get out of here.

16:59.180 --> 17:00.550
Okay, dip into graphics.

17:00.550 --> 17:02.520
I don't think that's
going to cover it.

17:02.520 --> 17:04.050
Frank, it's not my call.

17:06.220 --> 17:07.450
Oh, excuse me.

17:09.359 --> 17:11.960
Excuse me. I have
video footage.

17:11.960 --> 17:13.130
Uh, down the hall,
to the right.

17:18.200 --> 17:19.869
- Right here.
- Okay.

17:19.869 --> 17:22.500
Put the neighbor here, and the
kids with their mother by the door.

17:22.500 --> 17:24.839
- You can get it back from 2:16.
- Yeah.

17:24.839 --> 17:26.310
Then I want to lay
in some nat-sound.

17:26.310 --> 17:27.470
Let's loop the
neighbor's dog barking.

17:27.480 --> 17:30.040
And then try taking the
crying kid from B-roll

17:30.050 --> 17:31.550
and dropping that
in the background.

17:31.550 --> 17:32.980
Got it.

17:32.980 --> 17:34.410
You my fill-in operator?

17:34.420 --> 17:36.550
I don't think so.
I'm Lou Bloom.

17:36.550 --> 17:38.050
I have some footage for sale.

17:38.050 --> 17:39.390
A stringer?

17:39.390 --> 17:41.290
What? Who do you work for?

17:44.560 --> 17:46.890
At the moment, I
work for myself.

17:46.900 --> 17:49.830
See Frank out there,
the way you came.

17:49.830 --> 17:51.000
Uh, what's it timed to?

17:51.000 --> 17:52.070
1:06.

17:53.270 --> 17:54.500
What do you have?

17:57.270 --> 17:58.710
Something I'm fairly certain

17:58.710 --> 17:59.570
you'll be very excited about.

17:59.580 --> 18:01.610
What is it?

18:01.610 --> 18:04.710
It's a shooting. A man was shot.
Several times, in fact.

18:04.710 --> 18:07.410
He's lying on the ground, and
he's bleeding on the ground.

18:07.420 --> 18:09.220
I'd be surprised if
he survived, honestly.

18:09.220 --> 18:11.050
He was shot during
a carjacking.

18:11.050 --> 18:12.120
Western and First?

18:12.890 --> 18:14.050
Yes, that's right.

18:14.060 --> 18:16.260
We're getting that from Ace.

18:16.260 --> 18:18.560
I was there. I was much
closer to what happened.

18:19.760 --> 18:21.230
Okay. Okay.

18:21.230 --> 18:22.430
Let's see it.

18:25.700 --> 18:27.500
You can fast forward
through this.

18:30.410 --> 18:31.810
Keep going, keep going.

18:31.810 --> 18:34.110
<i> Walk away, or I'll
arrest you for...</i>

18:34.110 --> 18:35.610
A minute-and-a-half in.

18:39.550 --> 18:41.480
There.

18:41.480 --> 18:43.120
Oh, fuck.

18:46.760 --> 18:48.190
I need you to see something.

18:56.630 --> 18:58.100
Yeah? Lou Bloom.

18:58.100 --> 19:00.730
Frank Kruse, our
assignment editor.

19:00.740 --> 19:01.900
Play it back.

19:04.670 --> 19:05.710
<i> I got no pulse, here.</i>

19:07.910 --> 19:09.680
That's the lead.

19:09.680 --> 19:12.280
I want to break it up and do
a wrap-around from the scene.

19:12.280 --> 19:15.080
I want a walking stand-up, teaser
at five, repeat on the half

19:15.080 --> 19:16.520
and I want the copy to
start with a warning.

19:16.520 --> 19:17.650
You're going to show this?

19:17.650 --> 19:19.590
With a warning. It's excessive.

19:19.590 --> 19:21.350
We should have packages
like this every day.

19:21.360 --> 19:22.760
People are eating breakfast.

19:22.760 --> 19:24.760
And they'll talk
about it at work.

19:24.760 --> 19:26.860
Tie it in with the carjacking
last month in Glendale.

19:26.860 --> 19:30.030
And the other one, the van in Palms.
When was that? In March?

19:30.030 --> 19:31.260
March, yeah.

19:31.270 --> 19:32.830
It's a carjacking crime wave.

19:32.830 --> 19:34.530
That's the banner.

19:34.540 --> 19:36.300
Call the victim's family,
get a quote, mic it.

19:36.300 --> 19:37.670
You know what to do.

19:37.670 --> 19:38.510
Yeah.

19:39.840 --> 19:41.710
How much?

19:41.710 --> 19:43.340
I'm selling this particular
piece for $1,000.

19:43.350 --> 19:44.510
Not even close.

19:44.510 --> 19:46.180
This late, you have
nowhere else to go.

19:46.180 --> 19:48.180
And the quality's for shit.

19:48.180 --> 19:50.350
I'll give you $250,
that's the most I'll do.

19:50.350 --> 19:51.450
Now, let's get you paid.

19:53.890 --> 19:55.460
Here you go.

19:55.460 --> 19:57.990
Buy yourself some better
equipment, a directional mic,

19:57.990 --> 19:59.560
and get interviews
when you can.

19:59.560 --> 20:00.730
You have a good eye.

20:00.730 --> 20:02.160
Thank you.

20:02.160 --> 20:04.630
I'm just beginning, so praise
from someone such as yourself,

20:04.630 --> 20:06.500
well, you can imagine
that it means quite a lot.

20:06.500 --> 20:08.470
I'll help in any way I can.

20:08.470 --> 20:11.000
And, of course, you can
help me by calling us first.

20:11.010 --> 20:13.210
I want you to contact me
when you have something.

20:13.210 --> 20:14.540
Something like this.
That's right.

20:14.540 --> 20:16.540
Bloody.

20:16.550 --> 20:18.980
Well, that's only part of it.
We like crime.

20:18.980 --> 20:20.510
Not all crime.

20:20.520 --> 20:22.820
Carjacking in
Compton, for example.

20:22.820 --> 20:24.350
That isn't news, now is it?

20:24.350 --> 20:26.850
We find our viewers
are more interested

20:26.860 --> 20:29.760
in urban crime creeping
into the suburbs.

20:29.760 --> 20:32.330
What that means is a
victim, or victims,

20:32.330 --> 20:34.860
preferably well-off and white,

20:34.860 --> 20:37.730
injured at the hands of
the poor or a minority.

20:37.730 --> 20:39.170
Just crime.

20:39.170 --> 20:40.930
No. Accidents play.

20:40.940 --> 20:43.100
Cars, busses, trains, planes.
Fires.

20:43.110 --> 20:44.340
But bloody.

20:45.840 --> 20:47.670
Well, graphic.

20:47.680 --> 20:49.340
The best and clearest way

20:49.340 --> 20:50.580
that I can phrase
it to you, Lou,

20:50.580 --> 20:53.210
to capture the spirit
of what we air,

20:53.220 --> 20:55.850
is think of our newscast
as a screaming woman

20:55.850 --> 20:57.620
running down the street
with her throat cut.

20:58.790 --> 21:01.190
I understand.

21:01.190 --> 21:03.220
I'm a very, very quick learner.

21:03.230 --> 21:04.260
You will be seeing me again.

21:04.930 --> 21:06.160
I believe you.

24:02.140 --> 24:03.600
Uh, Rick.

24:03.610 --> 24:05.740
I'm Louis Bloom. Hey, Lou.

24:05.740 --> 24:07.540
Louis. Sit down.

24:12.750 --> 24:14.750
The situation is that
I lost an employee,

24:14.750 --> 24:16.950
and I'm interviewing
for a replacement.

24:16.950 --> 24:19.990
Okay. The ad didn't
say what the job was.

24:20.760 --> 24:21.990
It's a fine opportunity

24:21.990 --> 24:23.520
for some lucky someone.

24:23.930 --> 24:26.060
Okay.

24:26.060 --> 24:27.890
I'd like to know about
your prior employment

24:27.900 --> 24:29.560
and hear, in your own words,

24:29.560 --> 24:31.560
what you learned
from each position.

24:32.170 --> 24:33.400
My old jobs?

24:35.400 --> 24:38.670
I did landscaping
for a couple months.

24:38.670 --> 24:40.570
Like, mow, blow, and go.

24:41.640 --> 24:43.640
Uh...

24:43.650 --> 24:46.210
I learned that I had
hay fever, so I quit.

24:48.080 --> 24:50.020
Other jobs?

24:50.020 --> 24:51.280
I don't know.

24:51.290 --> 24:52.720
Like, a week here,
a week there.

24:54.090 --> 24:55.460
Why hire you?

24:57.490 --> 24:58.560
Sell yourself.

24:59.190 --> 25:00.930
Okay. Go.

25:00.930 --> 25:02.630
Okay.

25:02.630 --> 25:04.430
I'm Rick. Of course.

25:04.930 --> 25:06.000
Uh...

25:07.640 --> 25:09.700
I took three buses to get here.

25:09.700 --> 25:12.610
I finished high school.
I need a job.

25:12.610 --> 25:14.470
I'll do pretty much anything.

25:14.480 --> 25:16.040
That's me. Hire Rick.

25:16.040 --> 25:16.880
So... Hmm.

25:18.010 --> 25:19.780
What's your address, Richard?

25:20.450 --> 25:21.610
I don't have one.

25:21.620 --> 25:23.320
Not a permanent one right now.

25:23.320 --> 25:24.380
You're homeless.

25:24.390 --> 25:26.490
I was for a while.

25:26.490 --> 25:27.550
You trick.

25:27.560 --> 25:29.290
Work the street? No.

25:29.290 --> 25:31.020
Wasn't a question.

25:31.030 --> 25:32.460
I'm straight.

25:32.460 --> 25:33.630
Plenty of straight guys trick.

25:33.630 --> 25:34.960
Do you have a driver's license?

25:34.960 --> 25:36.530
Yeah.

25:36.530 --> 25:38.160
Do you know Los Angeles?

25:38.170 --> 25:39.530
Yeah. I grew up
all around here.

25:39.530 --> 25:41.130
Can you start tonight?

25:41.140 --> 25:42.400
Doing what?

25:45.970 --> 25:49.710
I run a successful
TV news business.

25:49.710 --> 25:52.080
We film breaking stories.

25:52.080 --> 25:53.680
Maybe you saw my
item this morning

25:53.680 --> 25:55.520
of a fatal carjacking.

25:55.520 --> 25:59.090
No. I don't have a TV,
but that sounds cool.

25:59.090 --> 26:00.490
Do you have a cellphone?

26:00.490 --> 26:01.650
Yeah.

26:02.560 --> 26:03.660
Does it have GPS?

26:03.660 --> 26:04.720
Yes, it does.

26:04.730 --> 26:05.930
Congratulations. You're hired.

26:06.430 --> 26:07.830
Okay.

26:10.100 --> 26:12.270
Your job will be to listen
to the emergency radio,

26:12.270 --> 26:15.840
learn police codes, help
navigate, and watch the car.

26:16.910 --> 26:17.740
Okay.

26:18.570 --> 26:19.910
And what does it pay?

26:19.910 --> 26:21.140
It's an internship.

26:24.180 --> 26:26.750
Man, I, uh...

26:26.750 --> 26:29.780
I can't do that. I need money.

26:29.780 --> 26:31.350
I'm giving you a chance

26:32.750 --> 26:34.220

my organization.

26:34.220 --> 26:35.920
It's not at all unusual for me

26:35.920 --> 26:38.020
to make full-time job
offers to my interns.

26:38.030 --> 26:39.090
No, I know.

26:41.730 --> 26:43.860
I got to get paid,

26:43.870 --> 26:45.470
like, something at
least, you know.

26:50.610 --> 26:52.610
I'll give you $30
cash per night.

26:53.780 --> 26:55.810

Slow down, man.

28:47.560 --> 28:48.750
That's too fast!

28:53.760 --> 28:55.230
Talk to me, Richard.
Talk to me, Richard.

28:55.230 --> 28:56.360
What next?

28:56.360 --> 28:57.560
Next left, coming up.

28:59.270 --> 29:00.930
Fuck!

29:02.740 --> 29:04.500
I need more warning next time.

29:04.510 --> 29:05.570
Where are we going?

29:05.570 --> 29:06.710
Talk to me! What's next?

29:06.710 --> 29:08.710
Okay. Keeping on this five...

29:08.710 --> 29:10.080
No, six blocks. Then a right.

29:10.080 --> 29:11.510
On what?

29:11.510 --> 29:13.110
I made a mistake!

29:13.110 --> 29:14.950
It's a right five blocks back.

29:17.920 --> 29:19.750
It's just five blocks.

29:33.530 --> 29:34.730
Did they bring him out?

29:34.740 --> 29:35.870
Ambulance left two minutes ago.

29:35.870 --> 29:37.440
You're a lifetime too late.

29:37.440 --> 29:38.970
Nice camera!

29:43.140 --> 29:44.480
On to the next.

29:58.130 --> 30:00.590
I bet I wasted five dollars
of gas just getting here

30:00.600 --> 30:02.030
or don't you think
that's a lot of money?

30:02.560 --> 30:03.960
I'm sorry.

30:03.970 --> 30:06.030
I couldn't see the screen,
you were driving so fast.

30:07.840 --> 30:09.940
Okay, first of all, Richard,

30:09.940 --> 30:12.840
don't answer me by
telling me a problem.

30:12.840 --> 30:14.510
I have enough of those already.

30:14.510 --> 30:16.040
Bring me a solution, and then
we can make a decision together.

30:17.910 --> 30:20.180
Okay. Maybe if you
didn't rush me.

30:23.080 --> 30:24.450
Don't rush you. Okay.

30:24.450 --> 30:26.790
I can use that.

30:26.790 --> 30:29.460
See, Rick, they've done studies

30:29.460 --> 30:32.120
and they found that in any
system that relies on cooperation

30:32.130 --> 30:33.530
from a school of fish,

30:33.530 --> 30:36.160
say, or even a professional
hockey team, for example,

30:36.160 --> 30:38.930
these experts have
identified communication

30:38.930 --> 30:41.000
as the number one
single key to success.

30:48.940 --> 30:51.180
You know what "fear" stands for?

30:51.650 --> 30:52.780
What?

30:52.780 --> 30:55.080
"False Evidence
Appearing Real."

30:58.190 --> 31:00.120
You're going really
fucking fast, dude.

31:00.120 --> 31:01.320
Get out of your head, Rick.

31:01.320 --> 31:03.020
It's a bad neighborhood.

31:03.020 --> 31:04.360
Now, when you get a chance,

31:04.360 --> 31:05.890
I'd like to know
where we're going.

31:05.890 --> 31:07.590
Uh, left on Third. Six blocks.

31:14.340 --> 31:16.540
Find a more appropriate
place to park the car,

31:16.540 --> 31:18.170
and don't get blocked in.

31:18.170 --> 31:19.870
Are you the one
that made the call?

31:19.870 --> 31:21.510
No, no. I think...

31:21.510 --> 31:24.180
I was trying to go to
sleep, and I heard a sound.

31:24.180 --> 31:26.180
It scared me.
That's why I called.

31:26.180 --> 31:28.050
Sir, what's going on?

31:28.050 --> 31:29.150
Who the fuck are you?

31:34.720 --> 31:36.860
TV news. What happened?

31:36.860 --> 31:38.690
It was a shooting.

31:38.690 --> 31:40.890
I told the cops that he was
waving a gun last week,

31:40.900 --> 31:42.330
but they didn't fucking care.

31:43.530 --> 31:45.730
Can you try one more
time without swearing?

31:45.730 --> 31:47.030
I'm not doing it again.

31:47.030 --> 31:49.170
But this is for TV.

31:49.170 --> 31:50.870
Yeah? I don't have a TV.

32:01.050 --> 32:02.720
It's over.

32:02.720 --> 32:04.450
Shot the place to shit.

32:13.430 --> 32:16.030
All right, guys, pack it up.
Let's move it out.

32:16.030 --> 32:19.200
...running out of there as fast as
we could. Through that window there.

33:25.770 --> 33:27.070
<i> Great shot.</i>

33:29.940 --> 33:31.570
Oh, that's fantastic.

33:32.670 --> 33:34.240
Oh, that's a great
piece of tape.

33:35.780 --> 33:37.640
You didn't get an
interview with the couple?

33:37.650 --> 33:39.180
I have footage of them.

33:39.180 --> 33:40.680
I have an interview
with a neighbor.

33:40.680 --> 33:42.150
She curses, but you
can cut that out.

33:42.150 --> 33:44.050
How did you get
inside the house?

33:44.050 --> 33:45.150
The door was open.

33:45.150 --> 33:46.220
They allowed you?

33:46.220 --> 33:47.620
I heard somebody
yell to come in,

33:47.620 --> 33:49.020
and when nobody was
inside, I left.

33:49.020 --> 33:50.890
And the only shot of the
couple is through a window?

33:50.890 --> 33:52.560
The police were
shutting it down.

33:52.560 --> 33:54.030
I don't like it. Like what?

33:54.030 --> 33:55.790
The footage looks
like he broke in.

33:55.800 --> 33:57.500
There's no close-up
of the homeowners

33:57.500 --> 33:58.630
and he's giving us their name

33:58.630 --> 34:00.130
off a piece of private
correspondence.

34:00.130 --> 34:01.130
Excuse me, that's junk mail.

34:01.140 --> 34:02.900
Well, I have a
problem with that.

34:02.900 --> 34:04.370
We'll knock out a
killer package.

34:04.370 --> 34:06.040
This is my job. No!

34:06.040 --> 34:08.040
Your job is writing
the tweet of the day.

34:08.040 --> 34:09.409
And getting Deb
to turn sideways

34:09.409 --> 34:10.639
during the weather forecast.

34:10.650 --> 34:12.909
We're running it.

34:12.909 --> 34:14.909
I like how you handled Frank.

34:14.920 --> 34:17.050
You didn't soften the
truth or dilute it.

34:17.050 --> 34:19.080
I think being clear with your
objectives is more important

34:19.090 --> 34:21.050
than trying to
present your ideas

34:21.060 --> 34:22.889
in a non-confrontational
manner.

34:22.889 --> 34:25.090
Do you have experience
in an office?

34:25.090 --> 34:27.030
Myself? Not presently, no.

34:27.030 --> 34:28.659
Where did you get all that?

34:28.659 --> 34:29.830
I study a lot online.

34:29.830 --> 34:31.199
Yeah? Like what?

34:31.199 --> 34:32.870
All sorts of things, actually.

34:32.870 --> 34:34.130
I'm on my computer all day.

34:35.870 --> 34:37.940
I haven't had what you'd call
much of a formal education,

34:37.940 --> 34:40.239
but you can find most anything
if you look hard enough.

34:48.050 --> 34:52.179
Last year, I took an online
business course, for example.

34:52.190 --> 34:55.050
And I learned that you have
to have a business plan

34:55.060 --> 34:57.120
before starting a business.

34:57.120 --> 34:59.460
And that why you
pursue something

34:59.460 --> 35:01.360
is equally as important
as what you pursue.

35:03.030 --> 35:05.930
The site advised you

35:05.930 --> 35:07.400
to answer the
following question

35:07.400 --> 35:09.640
before you decide where
to focus your abilities.

35:09.640 --> 35:11.240
The question was

35:11.240 --> 35:12.940
"What do I love to do?"

35:14.480 --> 35:16.080
The site suggested
making a list

35:16.080 --> 35:17.480
of your strengths
and weaknesses.

35:17.480 --> 35:18.780
What am I good at?

35:18.780 --> 35:21.080
What am I not good at?

35:21.080 --> 35:22.980
Maybe I want to strengthen
and develop knowledge

35:22.980 --> 35:24.280
about the things I'm
already good at.

35:24.290 --> 35:26.390
Maybe I want to
strengthen my weaknesses.

35:32.560 --> 35:34.460
I recently remade my list.

35:36.130 --> 35:38.800
And I'm thinking

35:38.800 --> 35:41.100
that television news

35:41.100 --> 35:44.400
might just be something I love

35:44.410 --> 35:46.370
as well as something I
happen to be good at.

35:59.920 --> 36:01.850
On TV, it looks so real.

36:03.820 --> 36:05.220
Yes. It does.

36:07.160 --> 36:09.090
Well, I have a show to do.

36:09.100 --> 36:12.000
Your check is at the desk.

36:12.000 --> 36:14.430
Outstanding work, Lou.
Really, just great.

36:14.440 --> 36:16.500
Thanks, Nina. That
means an awful lot.

36:18.870 --> 36:20.110
Okay.

36:44.730 --> 36:47.030
<i> It's every parent's nightmare.</i>

36:47.030 --> 36:49.370

39:06.710 --> 39:08.310
Rick, I'm very pleased
with how you progressed.

39:08.310 --> 39:10.340
You're doing a great job.

39:10.340 --> 39:11.780
However, you just spilled
gasoline on my car

39:11.780 --> 39:12.880
which will eat the paint.

39:12.880 --> 39:14.650
I need you tighten
up a bit on this.

39:14.650 --> 39:15.810
Because if you fill
it like that again,

39:15.820 --> 39:16.880
I will terminate
you immediately,

39:16.880 --> 39:18.620
I promise you.

39:56.220 --> 39:57.660
Oh, that's a good store.

40:00.590 --> 40:02.530
Making peace with
what you don't have,

40:02.530 --> 40:04.430
that's what it's all about.

40:04.430 --> 40:07.200
Living with what you
ain't got, right?

40:07.200 --> 40:09.170
Don't you think?

40:12.670 --> 40:15.170

Good neighborhood.

40:19.080 --> 40:20.780
TV news. What happened?

40:20.780 --> 40:22.680
I think it was a
head-on collision,

40:22.680 --> 40:24.180
and there's a guy
who's dead over there.

40:24.180 --> 40:26.080
There's a woman... Did
you see what happened?

40:26.090 --> 40:28.020
Am I supposed to help? I
didn't see, I came after.

40:28.020 --> 40:29.520
Can you tell me exactly
what happened?

40:29.520 --> 40:30.920
Will you get the
camera out of my face?

40:30.930 --> 40:32.290
Get it out!

40:32.290 --> 40:33.760
I'm trying to talk to 911!

No, it's at... The guy is down.

42:22.400 --> 42:25.570

We'll block it off.

42:37.420 --> 42:39.250

That's your third

42:59.840 --> 43:02.210
I'm focusing on framing.

43:02.210 --> 43:04.440
A proper frame not only
draws the eye into a picture

43:04.450 --> 43:06.180
but keeps it there longer,

43:06.180 --> 43:07.410
dissolving the barrier

43:07.410 --> 43:09.250
between the subject and
the outside of the frame.

43:10.920 --> 43:12.750
Is that blood on your shirt?

43:13.850 --> 43:16.390
I don't think so.

43:16.390 --> 43:18.890
I recently heard of
a Mexican restaurant

43:18.890 --> 43:20.460
called Cabanita.
Have you heard of it?

43:20.460 --> 43:22.190
It's also on your sleeve.

43:23.730 --> 43:25.100
I didn't see that.

43:27.970 --> 43:29.130
What I'm asking is,

43:29.140 --> 43:30.040
do you like Mexican food, Nina?

43:31.940 --> 43:33.210
Yes.

43:33.210 --> 43:35.810
Stand by, people. Here we go.

43:35.810 --> 43:37.580
Cabanita has been called

43:37.580 --> 43:38.640
"an authentic taste
of Mexico City."

43:42.150 --> 43:43.280
Do you wanna go with me?

43:43.280 --> 43:44.320
I think we could
have fun together.

43:45.650 --> 43:47.590
Thanks, but I'm busy.

43:47.590 --> 43:48.590
Saturday is your
night off, isn't it?

43:48.590 --> 43:50.560
I have a rule, Lou.

43:50.560 --> 43:52.760
I don't date
people I work with.

43:52.760 --> 43:54.560
And I'm twice your age.

43:54.560 --> 43:55.790
I like older women.

43:56.600 --> 43:58.060
Besides, I don't work with you.

43:58.070 --> 43:59.160
You're someone I sell to.

43:59.170 --> 44:01.770
And I don't wanna fuck that up.

44:01.770 --> 44:04.800
What if by saying
no, you fuck it up?

44:04.810 --> 44:06.300
All right, 10 seconds
to go and back on.

44:06.310 --> 44:07.670
Is that what you're saying?

44:09.610 --> 44:11.110
I didn't say that.

44:11.110 --> 44:14.680
Eight, seven, six, five...

44:14.680 --> 44:16.410
Well, I don't know what to say.

44:16.420 --> 44:18.450
...three, two, one.

44:18.450 --> 44:20.490
Good morning. Thank you for joining us.
I'm Lisa Mays.

44:20.490 --> 44:21.850
And I'm Ben Waterman.

44:21.860 --> 44:23.990
First up on <i> This
Morning</i> on KWLA News,

44:23.990 --> 44:26.460
a horrible car crash
over in Benedict Canyon.

44:26.460 --> 44:28.630
It's claimed the
life now of one man.

44:28.630 --> 44:30.100
Severely injured a young woman.

44:32.270 --> 44:33.060
Hey, Lou!

44:35.600 --> 44:38.170
Hey, man. Joe Loder, Mayhem.

44:38.170 --> 44:40.140
Great get tonight.

44:40.140 --> 44:42.640
They were closing it down
by the time we showed up.

44:42.640 --> 44:44.810
Were you waiting
for me out here?

44:44.810 --> 44:47.150
No, I was driving by
and I saw your car.

44:47.150 --> 44:50.050
You're not dropping your shit
off, are you? Nobody does that.

44:50.050 --> 44:52.480
You need an air card if you
want to be in the game.

44:52.490 --> 44:54.320
Import the video
to your laptop.

44:54.320 --> 44:55.450
Cut the video.

44:55.460 --> 44:57.120
Upload to your FTP site

44:57.120 --> 44:59.460
and notify stations you
got something for sale.

44:59.460 --> 45:01.030
Boom, boom, boom!

45:01.030 --> 45:02.760
Otherwise, it's a nice ride.

45:04.060 --> 45:06.060
Listen, man, you got
a good run going

45:06.070 --> 45:07.800
but there's valleys out there.

45:07.800 --> 45:10.470
Take it from me. I've been
nightcrawling for 14 years.

45:10.470 --> 45:12.040
You heard I'm
adding a second van?

45:12.040 --> 45:13.370
No. I didn't hear that.

45:13.370 --> 45:15.810
Gonna be a game changer.

45:15.810 --> 45:17.840
Cut my on-scene time in half.

45:17.840 --> 45:19.410
I'm setting up a
dedicated dispatch, too.

45:19.410 --> 45:22.210
No more listening and driving.
That's for suckers.

45:22.220 --> 45:24.020
You like the Canon 305s?

45:24.020 --> 45:25.380
Never used one.

45:25.390 --> 45:26.820
Six thou a piece.

45:26.820 --> 45:31.590
2.4 megapixels. Night vision.
18:1 zoom.

45:31.590 --> 45:33.990
I got one of those puppies
with your name on it.

45:33.990 --> 45:35.490
I have a camera.

45:35.500 --> 45:37.260
I want you running
my second van.

45:37.260 --> 45:39.700
Two crews. Half
the area to cover.

45:39.700 --> 45:41.070
Now, I know what
you're thinking.

45:41.070 --> 45:42.530
Half the money, right?

45:42.540 --> 45:44.600
You should be thinking,
twice the sales.

45:44.610 --> 45:45.940
Because we're going
to be the first

45:45.940 --> 45:47.240
at every scene.

45:47.240 --> 45:49.510
Why compete when we
can work together?

45:49.510 --> 45:51.080
You can share my press cards.

45:51.080 --> 45:53.510
Puppy dog off my
police connections.

45:53.510 --> 45:56.080
This is the big move,
the next level.

45:56.080 --> 45:57.720
We can corner this whole thing.

45:57.720 --> 45:59.880
I'm talking about putting some
heavy digits in our pocket, brah.

45:59.890 --> 46:01.520
Thank you for offering
me the position

46:01.520 --> 46:03.790
but working for
myself is more in line

46:03.790 --> 46:04.990
with my skills
and career goals.

46:08.060 --> 46:09.190
Take a few days
to think about it.

46:09.200 --> 46:10.430
No.

46:10.430 --> 46:11.760
You'll need to
hire someone else,

46:11.770 --> 46:12.930
and I don't want to
hold up the process.

46:12.930 --> 46:14.970
You want to be on the
inside of this, man

46:14.970 --> 46:17.800
because I'm going to be
tag-teaming every call.

46:17.800 --> 46:20.970
You keep talking
like it's something

46:20.970 --> 46:23.240
that I may be interested
in, but I'm not.

46:23.240 --> 46:25.440
You don't even
understand the offer.

46:25.450 --> 46:27.810
If you did, you'd be
fucking sucking my dick!

46:27.810 --> 46:29.280
You'd be asking me questions.

46:29.280 --> 46:31.380
What does this mean?
What does that mean?

46:31.390 --> 46:34.890
I feel like grabbing you
by your ears right now

46:34.890 --> 46:37.290
and screaming in your face,

46:37.290 --> 46:38.860
"I'm not fucking interested."

46:41.300 --> 46:44.030
Instead, I'm going to drive
home and do some accounting.

46:48.500 --> 46:49.700
Fuck you!

46:50.240 --> 46:51.540
Twerp.

47:04.480 --> 47:07.520
I didn't wake up until 5:00.

47:07.520 --> 47:10.420
My body is so off, I feel
like it's time for breakfast.

47:14.960 --> 47:17.530
I bet you're beautiful
any time of the day.

47:17.530 --> 47:20.470
In fact, I'd say

47:20.470 --> 47:22.270
you're much prettier
than Lisa Mays.

47:25.310 --> 47:26.710
I like the dark
makeup on your eyes.

47:26.710 --> 47:28.340
I also like the way you smell.

47:31.650 --> 47:33.180
So, where you from, Lou?

47:35.450 --> 47:36.950
The north end of the Valley.

47:38.550 --> 47:40.490
Some of the calls sometimes
take me over there,

47:40.490 --> 47:43.220
but nobody I know
still lives out there.

47:43.220 --> 47:45.290
You're from Philadelphia,
Pennsylvania.

47:45.290 --> 47:47.490
How did you know that?

47:47.490 --> 47:48.590
It's online.

47:50.030 --> 47:51.360
Everything about you is online.

47:51.370 --> 47:53.800
Not everything, but
definitely a lot.

47:53.800 --> 47:55.730
I've watched all the videos
from when you were a reporter.

47:55.740 --> 47:56.970
I'm sure you look
at those, of course.

47:56.970 --> 47:58.670
No. God, no.

47:58.670 --> 47:59.800
Not without a drink in my hand.

48:01.310 --> 48:03.710
I watch my work all the time.

48:03.710 --> 48:05.340
Yeah? Do you want to
become a reporter?

48:05.350 --> 48:06.280
No.

48:07.510 --> 48:09.310
Most of you guys want air time.

48:09.320 --> 48:11.080
Not me.

48:11.080 --> 48:14.520
I want to be the guy that owns
the station that owns the camera.

48:14.520 --> 48:17.090
The business is going well,

48:17.090 --> 48:18.990
but in order to grow
to the next level,

48:18.990 --> 48:20.360
I need to stay one step
ahead of my competition

48:20.360 --> 48:21.760
and take risks.

48:21.760 --> 48:23.800
I also need financial support
to implement expansion.

48:26.030 --> 48:27.330
Would you like
another margarita?

48:28.540 --> 48:29.970
One is enough.

48:30.900 --> 48:32.740
Thanks for coming out to talk.

48:33.710 --> 48:35.270
The place I'm in now

48:35.280 --> 48:37.710
is that I want a relationship

48:37.710 --> 48:40.040
with someone I can team up with

48:40.050 --> 48:43.010
and share, like we share, the
same job and hours and whatnot.

48:43.020 --> 48:44.750
I could go down a laundry
list, but you get the idea.

48:44.750 --> 48:46.380
Yes.

48:46.390 --> 48:48.190
Well, I hope you find someone.

48:49.960 --> 48:52.790
Here's the thing
about that, Nina.

48:52.790 --> 48:54.190
I'm quite certain
I already have.

48:57.360 --> 48:58.530
Okay.

48:59.630 --> 49:01.870
Let me put this politely.

49:01.870 --> 49:04.040
I only came out to
dinner with you, Lou,

49:04.040 --> 49:06.300
purely as a
professional courtesy.

49:08.710 --> 49:10.010
Thank you.

49:12.380 --> 49:13.650
I don't think it's any secret

49:13.650 --> 49:15.110
that I've
single-handedly raised

49:15.120 --> 49:16.480
the unit price of
your ratings book.

49:18.450 --> 49:22.290
Our ratings book price? Whoa!

49:24.060 --> 49:25.660
I'm a very fast learner.

49:25.660 --> 49:27.660
We had a conversation where I
specifically mentioned that.

49:27.660 --> 49:28.530
Do you remember that?

49:30.400 --> 49:31.230
Well, do you?

49:31.230 --> 49:32.830
Yes.

49:32.830 --> 49:35.000
I recently learned,
for instance,

49:35.000 --> 49:38.040
that most Americans watch
local news to stay informed.

49:40.010 --> 49:41.640
I also learned that

49:41.640 --> 49:43.170
the average half-hour of
Los Angeles television news

49:43.180 --> 49:45.580
packs all of its local
government coverage

49:45.580 --> 49:47.780
including law enforcement,
budget, transportation,

49:47.780 --> 49:49.480
education and immigration

49:49.480 --> 49:51.450
into 22 seconds.

49:51.450 --> 49:54.250
Local crime stories, however,
not only usually led the news

49:54.250 --> 49:55.920
but filled 14 times
the broadcast,

49:55.920 --> 49:57.490
averaging five minutes
and seven seconds.

49:57.490 --> 50:00.760
KWLA relies heavily
on such stories.

50:00.760 --> 50:02.490
With Los Angeles crime
rates going down,

50:02.500 --> 50:05.630
I think that makes items like
mine particularly valuable.

50:05.630 --> 50:07.270
Like rare animals.

50:08.640 --> 50:10.370
I can only imagine that
your needs will increase

50:10.370 --> 50:11.500
during next month's
rating sweeps period.

50:14.470 --> 50:15.540
Ooh!

50:18.380 --> 50:19.780
Yeah.

50:19.780 --> 50:22.210
Well, we certainly
appreciate what you do.

50:29.060 --> 50:31.260
There's certain good
things about being alone.

50:34.690 --> 50:36.360
You have time to do the
things you wanna do,

50:36.360 --> 50:38.000
like study and plan,

50:38.000 --> 50:39.030
but you can't have
dinners like this

50:39.030 --> 50:40.470
or be physical with a person.

50:40.470 --> 50:42.100
I mean, outside of
flirtation-ship.

50:45.140 --> 50:46.870
Where are you going with this?

50:48.910 --> 50:50.380
I want that.

50:52.680 --> 50:54.210
With you.

50:56.980 --> 50:59.720
Like you want to keep your job
and your health insurance.

51:01.860 --> 51:04.720
Look, just for starters,

51:04.720 --> 51:08.430
I don't need you to
keep my fucking job.

51:08.430 --> 51:11.260
You're the news director
on the vampire shift

51:11.260 --> 51:14.630
of the lowest-rated
station in Los Angeles.

51:18.370 --> 51:22.240
We have what could be considered
an almost-exclusive relationship.

51:22.240 --> 51:25.340
There are many other
places I could go.

51:25.350 --> 51:28.180
I have to think that you're
invested in this transaction.

51:28.180 --> 51:29.250
Here you are.

51:29.250 --> 51:30.350
Wow.

51:30.350 --> 51:32.120
Enjoy. Thank you.

51:35.790 --> 51:39.890
Where did you get the balls to
even suggest something like this?

51:39.890 --> 51:41.360
We're still talking.

51:41.360 --> 51:43.600
No. There's nothing
more to say.

51:43.600 --> 51:44.930
You can leave.

51:51.770 --> 51:53.400
Okay, look.

51:53.410 --> 51:56.310
You've done well. Okay?

51:56.310 --> 51:59.810
And we pay you well, very well.
We always have.

51:59.810 --> 52:04.420
If you like, I could get
you an exclusive retainer.

52:04.420 --> 52:06.650
That would be on top
of your segment fees.

52:06.650 --> 52:09.090
I could maybe even get
you a job at the station

52:09.090 --> 52:10.720
starting as a
production assistant.

52:10.720 --> 52:12.590
So that you could learn the
business from the inside.

52:12.590 --> 52:14.230
That's where you said
your interests lie.

52:14.660 --> 52:15.730
Mmm-hmm.

52:16.660 --> 52:18.160
You're not listening, Nina.

52:19.630 --> 52:21.500
I happen to know that you
haven't stayed at one station

52:21.500 --> 52:23.430
for longer than two
years at a time,

52:23.440 --> 52:24.970
and you're coming up
on two years soon.

52:28.240 --> 52:29.670
I can imagine

52:29.680 --> 52:31.010
that your contract is
for that length of time.

52:31.010 --> 52:32.310
And that next month's ratings

52:32.310 --> 52:33.850
directly affect that.

52:33.850 --> 52:36.780
So, you're threatening
that if I don't...

52:36.780 --> 52:38.150
I'm negotiating.

52:38.150 --> 52:39.820
You're threatening to
stop selling to me.

52:39.820 --> 52:42.020
That's your choice.

52:42.020 --> 52:43.590
The true price of any item

52:43.590 --> 52:45.190
is what somebody's
willing to pay for it.

52:45.190 --> 52:47.130
You want something.

52:47.130 --> 52:48.830
And I want you.

52:48.830 --> 52:50.190
To fuck you.

52:50.860 --> 52:52.860
And as a friend.

52:52.870 --> 52:55.600
Jesus Christ, friends
don't pressure friends

52:55.600 --> 52:56.670
to fucking sleep with them.

52:58.270 --> 53:00.040
Actually, that's
not true, Nina.

53:02.340 --> 53:05.780
Because as I'm sure you know,

53:05.780 --> 53:09.510
a friend is a gift
you give yourself.

53:42.720 --> 53:44.420
Okay, a left on Roth,

53:44.420 --> 53:45.920
and then six
blocks to the ramp.

53:45.920 --> 53:47.320
You're putting me on the 5?

53:47.320 --> 53:49.750
Yeah, the 2 to the 5
to the 110 to the 10.

53:49.760 --> 53:52.390
Did you read my traffic
memo yesterday?

53:52.390 --> 53:54.390
Did I read it?

53:54.390 --> 53:55.890
Yeah, I read it.

53:55.900 --> 53:57.930
What did it say?

53:57.930 --> 53:59.730
About the 5?

53:59.730 --> 54:01.530
Okay. I looked at it. What?

54:01.530 --> 54:02.900
Well, for one thing,
it included that

54:02.900 --> 54:04.240
the 5 has floating construction

54:04.240 --> 54:05.440
in the fast lane for
the next three weeks.

54:05.440 --> 54:07.370
So, given that, I
expect you to put me

54:07.370 --> 54:09.440
on the 2 to the 101
to the 110 to the 10.

54:09.440 --> 54:11.580
That's half of one,
six of the other.

54:11.580 --> 54:13.110
It's half dozen of
one, six of the other.

54:13.110 --> 54:14.280
What I'd like you
to do is admit that

54:14.280 --> 54:15.910
you didn't read what
you said you did.

54:15.920 --> 54:17.420
You know I'm a
reasonable person,

54:17.420 --> 54:19.080
but nobody likes to be lied to!

54:19.090 --> 54:21.250
Okay! When am I going
to get my raise?

54:21.250 --> 54:22.690
That's reasonable, right?

54:22.690 --> 54:24.420
You keep talking about
this performance review.

54:24.420 --> 54:25.520
When is it gonna happen?

54:25.530 --> 54:27.130
I've been out here
two months already,

54:27.130 --> 54:28.630
busting my ass every night.

54:28.630 --> 54:30.900
I'm tired of your promises
for more pay, man.

54:30.900 --> 54:32.100
I'm sleeping in a garage.

54:32.100 --> 54:34.030
Rick, trying to
leverage your salary

54:34.030 --> 54:35.900
in this economic environment
is near impossible.

54:35.900 --> 54:37.740
Most firms have set
starting wages.

54:37.740 --> 54:39.900
Ideally, you could
leverage with other offers,

54:39.910 --> 54:41.110
but that's just not the case

54:41.110 --> 54:42.540
in your situation right now.

54:42.540 --> 54:44.040
<i> Test 498.</i>

54:44.040 --> 54:45.480
<i> Engine 91. North division.
</i> <i> Battalion 12.</i>

54:45.480 --> 54:46.880
<i> Heavy rescue. 56.</i>

54:46.880 --> 54:48.280
<i> Air ops respond.
Reported plane down.</i>

54:48.280 --> 54:49.210
<i> Whiteman Field,
south of Foothill.</i>

54:49.220 --> 54:50.920
Reroute us to that.

54:50.920 --> 54:52.980
We're 22 minutes from Foothill,

54:52.990 --> 54:54.590
and only five from
a hit and run.

54:54.590 --> 54:56.150
They're rolling heavy
rescue and an air ambulance.

54:56.160 --> 54:57.820
Get me there, please.

55:13.770 --> 55:16.170
It's good right there.
Stay on that spot.

55:16.180 --> 55:17.910
Not getting through here.

55:19.680 --> 55:21.450
Whoa, whoa, whoa. It's
all over here, buddy.

55:21.450 --> 55:22.480
Turn it around, let's go.

55:25.990 --> 55:27.080
You're late.

55:28.790 --> 55:30.590
Hey, brah!

55:30.590 --> 55:33.660
Five fatals. Come screaming
out of the fucking sky.

55:33.660 --> 55:35.430
All lit up with
the brush on fire.

55:35.430 --> 55:38.830
Mine. Exclusive. I'm banging!

55:40.630 --> 55:43.600
And my other van is in
Carson, getting the jumper.

55:43.600 --> 55:45.640
You know...

55:45.640 --> 55:48.170
I was trying to
hook you up, man.

55:48.170 --> 55:50.040
I was trying to
teach you something.

55:53.110 --> 55:55.110
Welcome to the future, brah.

56:10.860 --> 56:12.960
A car crash.

56:12.970 --> 56:15.800
Well, none of this is
gonna knock anybody out.

56:15.800 --> 56:17.400
I can't use any of
this in my rundown.

56:18.140 --> 56:19.300
Is this it?

56:20.410 --> 56:22.410
No, I have a
stabbing in Corona.

56:22.410 --> 56:24.480
Where's the plane
crash at Foothill?

56:24.480 --> 56:26.410
I don't mind saying that I'm
trying to bring you stories

56:26.410 --> 56:27.880
that happen here on the ground.

56:27.880 --> 56:30.410
Two has it. It'll
be their lead.

56:30.420 --> 56:31.850
Well, I hope that
works well for them.

56:31.850 --> 56:33.650
Now, let me show you
the stabbing in Corona.

56:33.650 --> 56:37.020
I don't give a goddamn
about fucking Corona!

56:37.020 --> 56:38.860
You know how important
this week is.

56:38.860 --> 56:42.030
This shit is fucking
death to me!

56:42.030 --> 56:43.490
I understand your frustration.

56:43.500 --> 56:45.700
I was just trying not to
be too hard on myself.

56:45.700 --> 56:48.770
I sold you upstairs as some
kind of fucking sweeps savior.

56:48.770 --> 56:51.770
And I'm leading with
a goddamn stabbing.

56:51.770 --> 56:52.900
In Corona!

56:53.670 --> 56:54.910
So, you want that, then?

56:54.910 --> 56:57.240
I want you to get
in the goddamn game!

56:57.240 --> 56:59.610
I want something people
can't turn away from.

56:59.610 --> 57:01.680
I want what you
fucking promised me!

57:14.630 --> 57:16.130
<i> Good morning, everyone.</i>

57:16.130 --> 57:17.630
<i> Thanks for joining us.
</i> <i> I'm Pat Harvey.</i>

57:17.630 --> 57:19.560
<i> Hope your day's getting off to a
good start. I'm Kent Shocknek.</i>

57:19.570 --> 57:21.270
<i> We begin with</i> <i> a
tragedy last night</i>

57:21.270 --> 57:22.930
<i> in the foothills
of Santa Susana Pass</i>

57:22.940 --> 57:25.740
<i> where a private plane
crashed with no survivors.</i>

57:25.740 --> 57:28.310
<i> CBS2 has obtained
this exclusive video.</i>

57:28.310 --> 57:29.640
<i> We want to remind you now</i>

57:29.640 --> 57:31.640
<i> that what you're</i> <i> about
to see is graphic,</i>

57:31.640 --> 57:33.280
<i> and viewer
discretion is advised.</i>

58:32.640 --> 58:35.040
Since when did Coldwater
become faster than Laurel?

58:35.040 --> 58:38.310
Huh? What was the
thinking there?

58:38.310 --> 58:39.980
I didn't ask that to
hear myself speak.

58:39.980 --> 58:42.980
Because, you know, Coldwater
only has six lights.

58:42.980 --> 58:44.280
Laurel has places to pass.

58:44.280 --> 58:46.850
I can't get around this
person until Ventura.

58:46.850 --> 58:49.220
It's the same argument, man.
I said this route.

58:49.220 --> 58:50.520
If you wanted to take Laurel,

58:50.520 --> 58:51.790
you should have said something.

58:51.790 --> 58:53.160
I thought that you
worked in other factors.

58:53.160 --> 58:54.790
If I didn't think that
you could do better,

58:54.790 --> 58:56.730
I wouldn't ride you so
hard about the routes.

58:56.730 --> 58:58.330
I think you know that, Rick.

58:58.330 --> 58:59.830
I think it may just be possible

58:59.830 --> 59:02.670
that I have a higher opinion of
you than you have of yourself.

59:02.670 --> 59:04.070
What the fuck?

59:04.070 --> 59:05.200
God damn it!

59:07.310 --> 59:08.770
Seriously?

59:09.910 --> 59:12.180
To get to a van
crash on Moorpark?

59:12.180 --> 59:14.650
Who cares? What's the rush?

59:14.650 --> 59:17.720
Why aren't we at the rape at
Griffith Park like everybody else?

59:25.020 --> 59:27.860
Oh, fuck! Oh, fuck me.

59:27.860 --> 59:30.660
Oh, God! That's the
fucking Mayhem van.

59:30.660 --> 59:32.160
Joe Loder and the other dude.

59:32.170 --> 59:34.600
What's his name?
Fucking Marcus.

59:34.600 --> 59:36.570
Park the car and
get your camera.

59:39.870 --> 59:41.870
Now, let's get one guy inside.
Hold the seats back.

59:41.870 --> 59:43.040
You can't get that
in right there?

59:43.040 --> 59:44.940
No, there's no room.

59:47.010 --> 59:48.850
Here we go.

59:53.250 --> 59:56.050
What the hell happened?

59:56.060 --> 59:59.260
According to witnesses, they were
driving at a high rate of speed,

59:59.260 --> 01:00:01.130
probably toward Griffith Park,

01:00:01.130 --> 01:00:03.030
when, apparently, they ran
head-on into this light pole.

01:00:03.030 --> 01:00:04.600
No other car. Single vehicle.

01:00:06.430 --> 01:00:08.270
How did they just
run into a pole?

01:00:13.710 --> 01:00:15.310
Get that backboard
right up against him.

01:00:15.310 --> 01:00:16.740
Easy.

01:00:16.740 --> 01:00:18.940
Hey, don't film that, man.
He's one of us.

01:00:18.950 --> 01:00:20.440
Not anymore, Rick.

01:00:20.450 --> 01:00:22.110
We're professionals.

01:00:22.120 --> 01:00:24.580
He's a sale.

01:00:24.580 --> 01:00:27.790
Got facial trauma. Got
lacerations all the way down...

01:00:28.620 --> 01:00:30.050
Yeah, I'm calling it in.

01:00:30.060 --> 01:00:31.420
Minimize that movement.

01:00:31.420 --> 01:00:33.920
Get him back in the ambulance
and put some oxygen on him.

01:00:33.930 --> 01:00:35.490
Keep pressure on him.

01:00:35.500 --> 01:00:37.500
Back that unit off.

01:00:37.500 --> 01:00:39.500
Yeah, let's get some
four-by-fours on there.

01:00:40.900 --> 01:00:42.100
Bring the gurney all the way up.

01:00:43.240 --> 01:00:44.300
Come on, let's go.

01:00:44.300 --> 01:00:45.670
Stay with me.

01:00:45.670 --> 01:00:47.570
I got him, I got him.

01:00:47.570 --> 01:00:49.470
- Make sure you size him right.
- All right.

01:01:16.440 --> 01:01:18.770
Man, we are way
the hell out here.

01:01:26.210 --> 01:01:27.550
<i> Any Mission unit.</i>

01:01:27.550 --> 01:01:29.280
<i> Residential 211 in progress.</i>

01:01:29.280 --> 01:01:30.980
<i> 37 Bonhill Road.</i>

01:01:30.980 --> 01:01:32.850
<i> Receiving 211
siren activation.</i>

01:01:32.850 --> 01:01:36.050
Armed response on
a home invasion.

01:01:36.060 --> 01:01:37.960
We're five blocks away.
Pull a U-turn.

01:01:48.830 --> 01:01:51.200
At the end of the street.
Coming up.

01:01:51.200 --> 01:01:53.240
4808. Here!

01:01:58.380 --> 01:02:00.040
We beat the police.

01:02:00.050 --> 01:02:02.210
What do you want me to do?
You know what to do, Rick!

01:04:27.830 --> 01:04:30.290
<i> 3-X-21. Go ahead.</i>

01:04:30.300 --> 01:04:32.060
<i> 3-X-21, confirm address</i>

01:04:32.060 --> 01:04:33.560
<i> on the 211 at Bonhill Road.</i>

01:05:35.060 --> 01:05:37.190
What is going on?

01:05:37.200 --> 01:05:39.060
We're leaving. What?

01:05:39.060 --> 01:05:41.470
What's in there?
What's going on?

01:05:41.470 --> 01:05:42.630
What happened in there?

01:05:42.640 --> 01:05:43.770
You should have walked
in and looked, Rick,

01:05:43.770 --> 01:05:45.070
if you're that curious.

01:05:45.070 --> 01:05:46.200
That's what I'm
paying you to do.

01:05:46.210 --> 01:05:47.440
You need to show initiative.

01:05:47.440 --> 01:05:49.770
There is no better way
to achieve job security

01:05:49.780 --> 01:05:52.140
than by making yourself
an indispensable employee.

01:05:52.140 --> 01:05:53.480
I heard gunshots!

01:05:53.480 --> 01:05:55.610
All the more reason you
might have helped me.

01:05:55.610 --> 01:05:57.580
You might have learned a new
skill that made you more useful

01:05:57.580 --> 01:05:59.050
and put us on a
track toward growth!

01:06:37.190 --> 01:06:38.320
Stay in the car.

01:06:38.320 --> 01:06:40.060
Why? Because I said so.

01:07:27.570 --> 01:07:29.710
We have a hit-and-run
in Beverly Hills,

01:07:29.710 --> 01:07:32.510
a car versus pedestrian
incident and a robbery.

01:07:32.510 --> 01:07:33.710
Do we have footage of the crash?

01:07:33.710 --> 01:07:34.610
Surveillance footage.

01:07:40.190 --> 01:07:42.350
I've been trying to reach
you for the last hour.

01:07:42.350 --> 01:07:44.220
In the future, when you
don't have anything,

01:07:44.220 --> 01:07:46.660
man up and don't dodge
my fucking calls.

01:07:46.660 --> 01:07:48.390
I do have something.

01:07:48.390 --> 01:07:50.830
What?

01:07:50.830 --> 01:07:54.030
Home invasion, triple
murder in Granada Hills.

01:07:54.030 --> 01:07:55.170
That's just breaking now.

01:07:55.170 --> 01:07:56.770
We got there before the police.

01:07:59.440 --> 01:08:00.640
You have it?

01:08:04.580 --> 01:08:06.940
I'm not going to list the
many benefits of this piece.

01:08:06.950 --> 01:08:09.610
I think it's probably best if
you just watch it for yourself.

01:08:09.620 --> 01:08:11.180
I could have had someone
out there by now.

01:08:11.180 --> 01:08:12.780
Why didn't you call it in?

01:08:12.790 --> 01:08:14.790
To increase your need, and
improve my bargaining position.

01:08:16.120 --> 01:08:18.319
Frank, Jenny! Bay 2, now!

01:08:47.420 --> 01:08:49.550
Get Linda in here.

01:08:59.970 --> 01:09:01.899
Home invasion in Granada.

01:09:01.899 --> 01:09:03.300
He got there before the cops.

01:09:03.300 --> 01:09:04.430
We have 10 minutes to airtime.

01:09:04.439 --> 01:09:05.840
How much of this can we show?

01:09:07.140 --> 01:09:08.510
You mean, legally?

01:09:08.510 --> 01:09:10.840
No, morally. Of
course, legally.

01:09:10.840 --> 01:09:12.080
Have they been identified?

01:09:12.080 --> 01:09:13.779
It just happened, so
you have to assume no,

01:09:13.779 --> 01:09:15.410
and that's just
one of the issues.

01:09:15.410 --> 01:09:16.910
We can't broadcast
their identities

01:09:16.920 --> 01:09:18.350
without notifying
the next of kin.

01:09:18.350 --> 01:09:19.750
We're not identifying them.

01:09:19.750 --> 01:09:21.649
You are by proxy, by
showing their faces.

01:09:21.649 --> 01:09:23.520
We pixelate the faces.

01:09:23.520 --> 01:09:24.590
Where did you get this?

01:09:24.590 --> 01:09:25.920
Stringer.

01:09:25.920 --> 01:09:27.490
Hi, Linda. I'm Lou.

01:09:27.490 --> 01:09:29.960
Um, Jesus. Is there a
dead baby inside of there?

01:09:29.960 --> 01:09:31.500
No. The crib was empty.

01:09:31.500 --> 01:09:32.600
Oh, for Christ's sake.

01:09:32.600 --> 01:09:34.260
Are we breaking the
law by showing this?

01:09:37.140 --> 01:09:39.540
Block the faces, don't
give out the exact address.

01:09:39.540 --> 01:09:43.010
- Do that, I guess.
- I don't know.

01:09:43.010 --> 01:09:44.810
I wouldn't think so, no.

01:09:44.810 --> 01:09:45.939
Journalistically and ethically?

01:09:45.939 --> 01:09:47.010
This isn't Hartford.

01:09:47.010 --> 01:09:49.109
We are beyond all
broadcast standards.

01:09:49.109 --> 01:09:51.109
Have you seen the overnights?

01:09:51.120 --> 01:09:52.950
I'll risk the fine.

01:09:52.950 --> 01:09:54.320
What did you pay for this?

01:09:54.320 --> 01:09:56.350
The price hasn't
been negotiated yet.

01:09:57.220 --> 01:09:58.490
Give us a minute.

01:09:58.490 --> 01:09:59.590
Thanks.

01:10:05.000 --> 01:10:07.030
How much? $100,000.

01:10:07.030 --> 01:10:09.730
How much? $50,000.

01:10:09.740 --> 01:10:11.800
I need a number. Nine minutes.
I need a number.

01:10:11.800 --> 01:10:13.170
I just gave you two.

01:10:13.170 --> 01:10:14.570
$3,000.

01:10:14.570 --> 01:10:16.210
I got $3,000 for the
food truck stabbings.

01:10:16.210 --> 01:10:17.840
There were more dead.

01:10:17.840 --> 01:10:19.710
Those were poor Mexican
people in a roach coach.

01:10:19.710 --> 01:10:21.040
Two of them were illegals.

01:10:21.050 --> 01:10:22.410
These are three
wealthy white people,

01:10:22.410 --> 01:10:24.010
shot and killed
in their mansion.

01:10:24.020 --> 01:10:26.720
Including a suburban housewife
shotgunned in her bed.

01:10:26.720 --> 01:10:28.350
I know you, Nina.

01:10:28.350 --> 01:10:29.750
I know your interest and
excitement in this product

01:10:29.760 --> 01:10:31.250
is greater than the
amount you're offering.

01:10:39.030 --> 01:10:41.060
$5,000. $30,000.

01:10:41.070 --> 01:10:42.000
$7,000. $25,000.

01:10:42.000 --> 01:10:43.070
$8,000. $15,000.

01:10:43.070 --> 01:10:44.300
$9,000. $15,000.

01:10:45.240 --> 01:10:46.670
$10,000. $15,000.

01:10:46.670 --> 01:10:48.340
Give me a serious number.

01:10:48.340 --> 01:10:49.910
$15,000.

01:10:49.910 --> 01:10:51.410
Can't do it. Never happen.
There's a matter of precedent.

01:10:51.410 --> 01:10:53.040
Ten is my last best offer.

01:10:53.050 --> 01:10:54.140
Okay.

01:10:55.180 --> 01:10:56.610
Really?

01:10:56.620 --> 01:10:58.780
Where are you going?

01:10:58.780 --> 01:11:01.350
Seven has approached me
at least several times.

01:11:01.350 --> 01:11:03.020
The ND there gave
me his number.

01:11:03.020 --> 01:11:04.920
They'll make me a better offer.
It's a five-minute drive.

01:11:04.920 --> 01:11:06.460
Hold on!

01:11:13.630 --> 01:11:14.930
Twelve.

01:11:14.930 --> 01:11:16.370
Fifteen.

01:11:16.370 --> 01:11:19.200
I can't spend a month's
budget on a single story.

01:11:19.200 --> 01:11:20.100
What if the story's not over?

01:11:21.570 --> 01:11:23.370
The people who
did this escaped.

01:11:23.380 --> 01:11:26.940
They're still out there, walking
around with the rest of us.

01:11:26.950 --> 01:11:29.880
If I had a family and I lived in a
home, that might make me nervous.

01:11:29.880 --> 01:11:32.080
I'd want updates on
what was going on.

01:11:32.080 --> 01:11:34.180
With this footage, people would
turn to your channel for the story.

01:11:35.620 --> 01:11:37.450
I like you, Nina.

01:11:37.460 --> 01:11:39.220
And I look forward
to our time together.

01:11:39.220 --> 01:11:40.820
But you have to understand.

01:11:40.830 --> 01:11:43.760
$15,000 isn't all that I want.

01:11:43.760 --> 01:11:45.800
From here on, starting now,

01:11:45.800 --> 01:11:48.400
I want my work to be credited
by the anchors and on a burn.

01:11:48.400 --> 01:11:49.900
The name of my company is

01:11:49.900 --> 01:11:53.000
Video Production News, a
professional news-gathering service.

01:11:53.010 --> 01:11:54.100
That's how it should be read

01:11:54.110 --> 01:11:56.010
and that's how it
should be said.

01:11:56.010 --> 01:11:59.180
I also want to go to the next
rung, and meet your team.

01:11:59.180 --> 01:12:01.310
And the station manager and
the director and the anchors.

01:12:01.310 --> 01:12:03.450
And start developing my own
personal relationships.

01:12:03.450 --> 01:12:05.150
I'd like to start meeting
them this morning.

01:12:05.150 --> 01:12:07.150
You'll take me around, you'll introduce
me as the owner and President

01:12:07.150 --> 01:12:08.690
of Video Production News

01:12:08.690 --> 01:12:11.660
and remind them of some
of my many other stories.

01:12:11.660 --> 01:12:12.920
I'm not done.

01:12:12.930 --> 01:12:15.360
I also want to stop our
discussion over prices.

01:12:15.360 --> 01:12:16.490
This will save time.

01:12:16.500 --> 01:12:17.790
When I say that a
particular number

01:12:17.800 --> 01:12:19.500
is my lowest price,
that's my lowest price.

01:12:19.500 --> 01:12:20.700
And you can be assured
that I arrived

01:12:20.700 --> 01:12:22.870
at whatever that number
is very carefully.

01:12:22.870 --> 01:12:27.440
Now, when I say that
I want these things,

01:12:27.440 --> 01:12:29.540
I mean that I want them.

01:12:29.540 --> 01:12:31.440
And I don't want to
have to ask again.

01:12:31.440 --> 01:12:33.110
And the last thing
that I want, Nina,

01:12:33.110 --> 01:12:34.850
is for you to do the
things that I ask you to do

01:12:34.850 --> 01:12:36.210
when we're alone together
in your apartment.

01:12:36.220 --> 01:12:37.580
Not like the last time!

01:12:41.690 --> 01:12:42.850
So...

01:12:45.120 --> 01:12:46.790
I'll tell you what.

01:12:47.860 --> 01:12:49.860
I have the van crash
on Moorpark tonight.

01:12:49.860 --> 01:12:51.700
It was a couple of
stringers, actually.

01:12:51.700 --> 01:12:53.460
That could lead by itself
on an average night.

01:12:54.630 --> 01:12:55.700
I'd be willing to throw
that in for free.

01:12:59.470 --> 01:13:01.100
So what do you say,
do we have a deal?

01:13:05.480 --> 01:13:07.340
Lisa Mays, Ben
Waterman, Lou Bloom.

01:13:07.350 --> 01:13:09.580
Hi. Hello. How are you, Lisa?

01:13:09.580 --> 01:13:12.180
You remember Lou from the
Benedict Canyon crash.

01:13:12.180 --> 01:13:13.580
Oh, yeah. Amazing stuff.

01:13:13.590 --> 01:13:15.850
That was my company,
Video Production News.

01:13:15.850 --> 01:13:17.350
I would just like to say

01:13:17.360 --> 01:13:20.860
that I think that what the two
of you do is incredibly valuable.

01:13:20.860 --> 01:13:22.390
Thank you. That's
nice of you to say.

01:13:22.390 --> 01:13:24.160
We appreciate it.

01:13:24.160 --> 01:13:25.230
- I
- don't know how long

01:13:25.230 --> 01:13:26.860
this tape runs,
we might dump out.

01:13:26.870 --> 01:13:28.730
Twenty seconds to back. Ben
and Lisa, 20 seconds to back.

01:13:28.730 --> 01:13:31.170
Set up a sting dig,
Camera Two on a two-shot.

01:13:31.170 --> 01:13:32.270
Where's the banner?

01:13:32.270 --> 01:13:33.270
Did we decide on one?

01:13:33.270 --> 01:13:34.370
Horror House.

01:13:34.370 --> 01:13:35.940
What did we talk about?

01:13:35.940 --> 01:13:37.670
Can you build that?
Put it on CG-one.

01:13:37.680 --> 01:13:38.880
Back in 10 seconds.

01:13:38.880 --> 01:13:42.380
Nine, eight, seven, six,

01:13:42.380 --> 01:13:45.420
five, four, three,

01:13:45.420 --> 01:13:48.250
two, one. Sting it.

01:13:49.590 --> 01:13:52.360
Mics. Dissolve. Cue.

01:13:52.360 --> 01:13:54.760
<i> Hello, everybody. This is
KWLA with breaking news.</i>

01:13:54.760 --> 01:13:57.580
<i> Over the last half-hour or so,</i>

01:13:57.580 --> 01:14:00.400
<i> we've now received word of an
apparent home invasion triple homicide</i>

01:14:00.400 --> 01:14:02.700
<i> in the Granada Hills area
of the San Fernando Valley.</i>

01:14:02.700 --> 01:14:04.700
<i> Now, at present, the
number of those dead...</i>

01:14:04.700 --> 01:14:05.970
Preset Camera Two.

01:14:05.970 --> 01:14:07.240
<i> ...have not been confirmed
yet by the police</i>

01:14:07.240 --> 01:14:09.810
<i> but KWLA has obtained
exclusive footage</i>

01:14:09.810 --> 01:14:12.040
<i> from inside the crime scene</i>

01:14:12.040 --> 01:14:14.310
<i> in which at least three
bodies can be observed.</i>

01:14:14.310 --> 01:14:16.810
<i> Now, we're going to show
you segments of that footage</i>

01:14:16.820 --> 01:14:18.450
<i> throughout the rest
of this broadcast,</i>

01:14:18.450 --> 01:14:20.150
<i> but also throughout the day.</i>

01:14:20.150 --> 01:14:21.550
Ben, Lisa, I have a tape. When
you're ready, throw to it.

01:14:21.550 --> 01:14:23.750
I'll follow you.

01:14:23.760 --> 01:14:27.060
<i> Again, we're about to</i> <i> show
you</i> <i> exclusive KWLA video</i>

01:14:27.060 --> 01:14:28.790
<i> from inside</i> <i> the
actual crime scene.</i>

01:14:28.790 --> 01:14:30.130
It's graphic. Repeat it.

01:14:30.130 --> 01:14:32.230
<i> And before
broadcasting this video,</i>

01:14:32.230 --> 01:14:36.230
<i> we want to warn our viewers</i> <i> that
these are</i> <i> extremely graphic images.</i>

01:14:36.230 --> 01:14:38.770
<i> And I'm hearing</i> <i> from our control
room</i> <i> that we have that video,</i>

01:14:38.770 --> 01:14:40.640
<i> and we're going
to show it now.</i>

01:14:40.640 --> 01:14:43.810
<i> This is footage</i> <i> that we have
obtained</i> <i> exclusively by KWLA</i>

01:14:43.810 --> 01:14:45.440
<i> from Video Production News.</i>

01:14:45.440 --> 01:14:47.580
<i> This is a professional
news-gathering service.</i>

01:14:47.580 --> 01:14:49.780
<i> This is what appears
to be a shotgun,</i>

01:14:49.780 --> 01:14:52.150
<i> something you might
use</i> <i> for home defense.</i>

01:14:52.150 --> 01:14:53.480
<i> You can see</i> <i> the pistol grips</i>

01:14:53.490 --> 01:14:54.950
<i> on the front</i> <i> and
the back there.</i>

01:14:54.950 --> 01:14:56.650
<i> Quite possibly
the murder weapon.</i>

01:14:56.660 --> 01:14:59.490
<i> And now,</i> <i> Lisa, as we move
inside,</i> <i> this is a beautiful home.</i>

01:14:59.490 --> 01:15:02.090
<i> A beautiful home</i> <i> in a
very safe</i> <i> neighborhood.</i>

01:15:02.090 --> 01:15:03.930
<i> Or, what most people think
is a safe neighborhood.</i>

01:15:03.930 --> 01:15:06.860
<i> It appears that</i> <i> that
is the first body.</i>

01:15:06.870 --> 01:15:09.030
<i> A young woman,</i> <i> I'm
guessing,</i> <i> from this angle.</i>

01:15:09.030 --> 01:15:11.030
<i> A young woman
on a sofa, there.</i>

01:15:11.040 --> 01:15:13.840
<i> All of the faces, though,
have been blurred out.</i>

01:15:13.840 --> 01:15:15.270
They've escaped.
They're on the loose.

01:15:15.270 --> 01:15:17.340
<i> That is the first
of what we understand</i>

01:15:17.340 --> 01:15:19.880
<i> are three bodies</i> <i> in the
home</i> <i> in Granada Hills.</i>

01:15:19.880 --> 01:15:22.710
<i> And this was</i> <i> committed
by a suspect,</i> <i> or suspects</i>

01:15:22.710 --> 01:15:24.480
<i> who are still out there.</i>

01:15:24.480 --> 01:15:26.450
<i> They're believed
to have escaped.</i>

01:15:26.450 --> 01:15:28.650
<i> And if you think about that, that
is a very frightening thought.</i>

01:15:28.650 --> 01:15:29.990
Repeat that.

01:15:29.990 --> 01:15:31.860
<i> Yes, scary, and
very concerning,</i>

01:15:31.860 --> 01:15:33.620
<i> particularly given</i> <i> what
we're</i> <i> looking at here.</i>

01:15:33.630 --> 01:15:35.990
<i> The savagery</i> <i> of what
these</i> <i> pictures show.</i>

01:15:35.990 --> 01:15:37.690
<i> And now, look,
there on the floor.</i>

01:15:37.700 --> 01:15:40.500
<i> Lisa, what is that?</i> <i> A
bloodied</i> <i> article of clothing?</i>

01:15:40.500 --> 01:15:41.800
<i> It looks like</i> <i> a silk shirt.</i>

01:15:41.800 --> 01:15:43.400
<i> Maybe a woman's</i> <i> silk blouse.</i>

01:15:43.400 --> 01:15:45.070
<i> It's just so sad.</i>

01:15:45.070 --> 01:15:47.300
Stand by to dissolve, Two.

01:15:47.310 --> 01:15:49.510
<i> And, obviously, there
is the second body.</i>

01:15:49.510 --> 01:15:51.240
- They've escaped. Repeat it.
<i>-  The person or people</i>

01:15:51.240 --> 01:15:53.910
<i> who committed</i> <i> all of this
brutal</i> <i> home invasion robbery,</i>

01:15:53.910 --> 01:15:57.180
<i> they're presently</i> <i> unidentified and
at large,</i> <i> still on the streets.</i>

01:15:57.180 --> 01:15:58.520
Hit it again. Harder.

01:15:58.520 --> 01:16:00.250
<i> This has got to
be</i> <i> a huge worry</i>

01:16:00.250 --> 01:16:01.890
<i> not only to the residents
in this neighborhood,</i>

01:16:01.890 --> 01:16:03.220
<i> the Granada Hills
area as well.</i>

01:16:03.220 --> 01:16:05.240
<i> All of Los Angeles,
if you think about it.</i>

01:16:05.240 --> 01:16:07.260
<i> Yeah, the entire</i> <i> Southland, really.
</i> <i> Tonight, absolutely.</i>

01:16:07.260 --> 01:16:09.890
<i> An apparent family
attacked, savagely killed.</i>

01:16:09.900 --> 01:16:12.230
<i> We believe this
is their own home.</i>

01:16:12.230 --> 01:16:14.260
<i> In what is one of the quieter,</i>

01:16:14.270 --> 01:16:17.330
<i> I think a frankly more upscale
and affluent neighborhoods</i>

01:16:17.340 --> 01:16:18.570
<i> in the whole Valley.</i>

01:16:18.570 --> 01:16:20.400
<i> In all of Los Angeles.</i>

01:16:20.410 --> 01:16:22.510
<i> And now,</i> <i> as we're moving,</i>
<i> this is a nursery.</i>

01:16:22.510 --> 01:16:23.910
<i> And you hope to God...
</i> Build it.

01:16:23.910 --> 01:16:26.340
<i> ...that there's not
a baby in that crib.</i>

01:16:26.340 --> 01:16:28.710
<i> Yeah, you're just praying
that that crib is empty.</i>

01:16:28.710 --> 01:16:30.910
<i> Because this is
definitely a child's room.</i>

01:16:30.920 --> 01:16:33.720
<i> And, now, as we look, thank goodness.
Absolutely great.</i>

01:16:33.720 --> 01:16:35.350
<i> In fact,</i> <i> our
understanding</i> <i> right now</i>

01:16:35.350 --> 01:16:37.350
<i> is that there was</i> <i> no
baby found</i> <i> in the house.</i>

01:16:37.360 --> 01:16:38.890
<i> Or any baby that
was seen at all</i>

01:16:38.890 --> 01:16:40.520
<i> by the people</i> <i> who
filmed this for us.</i>

01:16:40.530 --> 01:16:41.690
<i> Thank goodness.</i>

01:16:41.690 --> 01:16:43.390
<i> That's Video News,</i>

01:16:43.400 --> 01:16:46.200
<i> this is a professional
news-gathering</i> <i> service that we use.</i>

01:16:46.200 --> 01:16:48.260
<i> Apparently,</i> <i> what we're
hearing from their photographer</i>

01:16:48.270 --> 01:16:51.730
<i> is that they arrived even
before the police did.</i>

01:16:51.740 --> 01:16:53.740
<i> And then entered
this home to help,</i>

01:16:53.740 --> 01:16:56.070
<i> or at least offer
some sort of assistance</i>

01:16:56.070 --> 01:16:57.910
<i> and then came upon</i> <i> what
you're</i> <i> looking at here.</i>

01:16:57.910 --> 01:17:00.440
<i> They came upon</i> <i> three bodies.</i>

01:17:00.450 --> 01:17:03.550
<i> And that, right there</i> <i> is
the third body</i> <i> on the floor.</i>

01:17:03.550 --> 01:17:06.320
<i> This is a man, gray hair. What would
you think, Lisa? Maybe 40s, 50s?</i>

01:17:06.320 --> 01:17:07.650
<i> Yeah, 50s. Maybe even 60s.</i>

01:17:07.650 --> 01:17:10.120
"Vicious attack."

01:17:10.120 --> 01:17:11.960
<i> We've been looking at
all this graphic footage</i>

01:17:11.960 --> 01:17:14.260
<i> and just the viciousness,
the severity of violence.</i>

01:17:14.260 --> 01:17:15.890
Master control, we're
going to come to a break.

01:17:15.890 --> 01:17:18.560
We're going to commercial, then cutting
to Joel and a police statement.

01:17:18.560 --> 01:17:19.960
<i> I'm getting</i> <i> word
right now that police</i>

01:17:19.970 --> 01:17:22.570
<i> are getting ready
to issue a statement</i>

01:17:22.570 --> 01:17:25.500
<i> from the scene</i> <i> and Joel
Beatty</i> <i> is there for that.</i>

01:17:25.500 --> 01:17:27.570
<i> Right now, we're going
to take a quick break.</i>

01:17:27.570 --> 01:17:30.010
Ready to break in five, four...

01:17:30.010 --> 01:17:31.110
Sneak in your music.

01:17:31.110 --> 01:17:33.280
Three, two, one.

01:17:33.280 --> 01:17:35.350
Fade to black. Roll your break.

01:17:35.350 --> 01:17:36.450
That's a 10-share.

01:17:38.080 --> 01:17:39.450
I want theme music
on the return,

01:17:39.450 --> 01:17:41.620
the cut we used for
the Simi rail crash.

01:17:41.620 --> 01:17:43.790
Audio, cut 32, please.
Cut 32 when we come back.

01:17:48.360 --> 01:17:49.690
Hello?

01:17:49.690 --> 01:17:50.830
Rolling with your banner.

01:17:50.830 --> 01:17:52.030
Thank you.

01:17:53.430 --> 01:17:55.430
Actually, he'd
like to meet you.

01:17:55.430 --> 01:17:57.430
Come back, One, and key on Ben.

01:17:57.440 --> 01:17:59.270
<i> Hey,</i> <i> heads up, you guys.
</i> <i> The police spokesman</i>

01:17:59.270 --> 01:18:01.670
<i> is making an announcement in 60 seconds.
</i> I gotta go.

01:18:02.670 --> 01:18:04.270
<i> Nina, we are getting
a ton of heat</i>

01:18:04.280 --> 01:18:06.880
<i> from the police out
here</i> <i> about that video.</i>

01:18:06.880 --> 01:18:08.310
Tell them to call the station.

01:18:08.310 --> 01:18:09.880
Fifteen seconds.

01:18:09.880 --> 01:18:12.050
<i> They want to talk to</i> <i> the
person who shot it.</i> I shot it.

01:18:12.050 --> 01:18:14.050
Joel, it's Video
Production News.

01:18:14.050 --> 01:18:15.490
Tell them to call me.

01:18:15.490 --> 01:18:17.020
Lou, they can't hear you.

01:18:17.020 --> 01:18:18.890
Coming back in five,

01:18:18.890 --> 01:18:22.830
four, three, two, one.

01:18:22.830 --> 01:18:24.160
Fade up.

01:18:29.400 --> 01:18:33.370
<i> We have</i> <i> more information coming
in</i> <i> from the Granada Hills area</i>

01:18:33.370 --> 01:18:34.640
<i> and the scene of</i> <i> an
apparent home invasion</i>

01:18:34.640 --> 01:18:36.310
<i> that has left</i> <i> a
husband and wife</i>

01:18:36.310 --> 01:18:37.710
<i> and their housekeeper...</i>

01:18:37.710 --> 01:18:39.010
<i> What we know at
the moment is that</i>

01:18:39.010 --> 01:18:40.810
<i> at some time around
5:00 this morning,</i>

01:18:40.810 --> 01:18:43.050
<i> gunmen broke into
this upscale...</i>

01:18:43.050 --> 01:18:46.020
<i> Residents are disturbed</i> <i> and concerned
by the brutal</i> <i> triple murder...</i>

01:18:46.020 --> 01:18:47.980
<i> The way</i> <i> we got it, though,
is a video production crew</i>

01:18:47.990 --> 01:18:49.690
<i> that we work with
from time to time.</i>

01:18:49.690 --> 01:18:51.190
<i> They, apparently,
arrived on the scene</i>

01:18:51.190 --> 01:18:53.160
<i> in Granada Hills before
the police got there.</i>

01:18:53.160 --> 01:18:54.320
<i> Before anybody.</i>

01:18:54.330 --> 01:18:56.530
<i> The photographer who
took those pictures</i>

01:18:56.530 --> 01:18:59.000
<i> told us earlier that he
walked up to the door,</i>

01:18:59.000 --> 01:19:01.700
<i> he saw what we all
saw in his videotape.</i>

01:19:01.700 --> 01:19:04.770
<i> And then he started to look
inside, so that he could help</i>

01:19:04.770 --> 01:19:06.500
<i> or render assistance
to someone.</i>

01:19:06.500 --> 01:19:07.840
<i> That's when</i> <i> he
walked into the house</i>

01:19:07.840 --> 01:19:09.770
<i> and started
shooting the video.</i>

01:19:09.770 --> 01:19:11.770
<i> He found the three</i>
<i> deceased in the house.</i>

01:19:11.780 --> 01:19:12.980
<i> The two females</i> <i> and the one...</i>

01:19:25.420 --> 01:19:27.420
Hello. Hi.

01:19:27.430 --> 01:19:29.930
I'm Detective Frontieri. This is
my partner, Detective Lieberman.

01:19:29.930 --> 01:19:31.090
Are you Louis Bloom?

01:19:31.100 --> 01:19:32.700
Yes, I'm Lou.

01:19:32.700 --> 01:19:34.730
You live here?
Yes, that's right.

01:19:34.730 --> 01:19:36.200
May we come inside?

01:19:36.200 --> 01:19:37.470
Why not?

01:19:37.470 --> 01:19:39.700
You want to? Yes.

01:19:39.700 --> 01:19:40.870
I don't care.

01:19:40.870 --> 01:19:42.040
Wonderful.

01:19:47.280 --> 01:19:49.150
You were in Granada
Hills last night.

01:19:49.150 --> 01:19:50.710
Yes, that's right.

01:19:50.720 --> 01:19:52.320
You shot the video
in the house?

01:19:52.320 --> 01:19:54.620
Yes, ma'am, I did.
That's right.

01:19:54.620 --> 01:19:58.020
You went inside the house? You
filmed all through the house?

01:19:58.890 --> 01:19:59.860
You even filmed the bodies.

01:20:00.660 --> 01:20:02.230
All before the police came.

01:20:02.230 --> 01:20:03.230
That door was open, ma'am.

01:20:03.230 --> 01:20:04.630
Detective.

01:20:04.630 --> 01:20:07.560
The door was open
and what I did was

01:20:07.570 --> 01:20:08.970
I went in to see
if I could help,

01:20:08.970 --> 01:20:10.430
because the alarm was ringing.

01:20:10.440 --> 01:20:11.970
An active crime scene.

01:20:11.970 --> 01:20:13.400
I didn't know it
was a crime scene.

01:20:14.740 --> 01:20:16.410
You knew what it was.

01:20:16.410 --> 01:20:18.510
I know that an alarm means
someone is in trouble.

01:20:18.510 --> 01:20:21.310
And you sold it
to be shown on TV.

01:20:21.310 --> 01:20:23.350
We're a professional
news-gathering service.

01:20:23.350 --> 01:20:25.520
What did you see
when you arrived?

01:20:25.520 --> 01:20:27.850
Uh, two men leaving
in a vehicle.

01:20:27.850 --> 01:20:29.620
You saw two men?

01:20:29.620 --> 01:20:32.320
They were just shapes, really.
I was afraid, so I hid.

01:20:32.320 --> 01:20:33.920
And then I saw the
shapes of two men

01:20:33.930 --> 01:20:36.130
moving inside the
vehicle, if that helps.

01:20:36.130 --> 01:20:37.430
Describe the men.

01:20:37.430 --> 01:20:38.700
It was dark.

01:20:38.700 --> 01:20:40.500
And then they drove away.

01:20:40.500 --> 01:20:42.370
- Black? White? Tall?
- I couldn't see.

01:20:42.370 --> 01:20:43.500
What were they driving?

01:20:43.500 --> 01:20:44.770
An SUV.

01:20:45.500 --> 01:20:46.940
Dark-colored.

01:20:46.940 --> 01:20:48.770
Rims? Tinted windows?

01:20:48.770 --> 01:20:51.340
Maybe. Not that I saw.

01:20:51.340 --> 01:20:53.940
Do you have any film
on the men or the car?

01:20:53.950 --> 01:20:56.110
No, I don't. I only started
filming when I was inside.

01:20:56.110 --> 01:20:57.980
Mmm-hmm.

01:20:57.980 --> 01:21:00.150
I'd like a copy
of that footage.

01:21:00.150 --> 01:21:02.320
Do I have to give it to you?

01:21:02.320 --> 01:21:04.650
Is there any reason
why you wouldn't?

01:21:04.660 --> 01:21:07.490
No, no, I made you a copy.
I expected someone to come.

01:22:16.930 --> 01:22:18.490
What's up, man?

01:22:19.530 --> 01:22:22.370
I'm tired. Aren't you tired?

01:22:22.370 --> 01:22:24.870
Why are we starting so early?

01:22:24.870 --> 01:22:28.100
One of the people in the
house last night was alive.

01:22:29.570 --> 01:22:32.140
I cut that part out.

01:22:32.140 --> 01:22:33.910
I also cut out the men
leaving in their car.

01:22:33.910 --> 01:22:36.150
I have a name and an address.
We're gonna drive there.

01:22:39.480 --> 01:22:41.020
We're gonna find the
person that drove that car.

01:22:41.020 --> 01:22:42.550
So you know who
killed those people?

01:22:42.550 --> 01:22:44.120
One of them, quite
possibly, yes.

01:22:45.660 --> 01:22:47.460
You gotta call the cops.

01:22:47.460 --> 01:22:48.890
And we will, at the right time.

01:22:58.140 --> 01:23:01.140
I'm offering you a real
opportunity here, Rick.

01:23:01.910 --> 01:23:03.210
To do what?

01:23:07.250 --> 01:23:08.740
I don't usually share my
business plan with you.

01:23:10.820 --> 01:23:14.150
But a moment has arrived
that could allow the company

01:23:14.150 --> 01:23:16.920
to make enough money to
expand to the next level.

01:23:18.420 --> 01:23:20.160
We could call this

01:23:23.190 --> 01:23:26.430
the critical moment.

01:23:26.430 --> 01:23:28.360
I'm inviting you, Rick,
to be a part of the team

01:23:28.370 --> 01:23:31.330
that pounces on
this opportunity.

01:23:31.340 --> 01:23:32.770
You've been asking a lot about
your performance review.

01:23:33.540 --> 01:23:34.640
Yeah.

01:23:34.640 --> 01:23:35.740
Well.

01:23:36.610 --> 01:23:38.940
For starters,

01:23:38.940 --> 01:23:40.210
I've been seeing a
great improvement

01:23:40.210 --> 01:23:42.210
in your overall focus
and order-following.

01:23:43.550 --> 01:23:45.980
Given complex problems, you're
developing a real ability

01:23:45.980 --> 01:23:48.220
to find clear and
simple solutions.

01:23:48.220 --> 01:23:50.520
I'm also aware of your
increased enthusiasm.

01:23:50.520 --> 01:23:51.620
It's great to see
your eyes light up

01:23:51.620 --> 01:23:52.790
when you're working
on a new idea.

01:23:52.790 --> 01:23:54.560
I hope you'll be inspiring us

01:23:54.560 --> 01:23:57.760
with your innovative
thinking for years to come.

01:23:59.300 --> 01:24:02.100
Thank you, man. I'm trying.
You know?

01:24:03.370 --> 01:24:05.800
Which is why I'm promoting you

01:24:05.800 --> 01:24:09.870
to Executive Vice
President of Video News.

01:24:12.680 --> 01:24:14.210
What am I now?

01:24:15.350 --> 01:24:17.280
You're an assistant.

01:24:19.520 --> 01:24:21.620
That's...Big.

01:24:26.190 --> 01:24:28.490
Does it come with a raise?

01:24:28.490 --> 01:24:30.190
Absolutely.

01:24:30.190 --> 01:24:32.230
How much?

01:24:33.500 --> 01:24:36.270
Pick a number. You
pick a number.

01:24:40.610 --> 01:24:43.110
A...

01:24:45.280 --> 01:24:48.910
$75 a night?

01:24:50.420 --> 01:24:51.510
Agreed.

01:24:53.920 --> 01:24:56.290
What about more? You know?

01:24:56.290 --> 01:24:57.750
Not now.

01:24:57.760 --> 01:24:59.660
We closed the deal.

01:25:02.690 --> 01:25:04.630
I could have gotten
more, couldn't I?

01:25:04.630 --> 01:25:06.260
Absolutely.

01:25:08.870 --> 01:25:11.400
All right. It's coming
up on the left.

01:25:11.400 --> 01:25:14.940
Halfway down the block.
1701 North Burns.

01:25:25.550 --> 01:25:27.720
Is that the car? That's the car.

01:25:27.720 --> 01:25:28.780
Oh, shit.

01:25:51.110 --> 01:25:52.340
Do you think there's a reward?

01:25:52.340 --> 01:25:53.980
There is a reward.

01:25:53.980 --> 01:25:56.180
How much? $50,000.

01:25:57.750 --> 01:25:59.180
Do I get any of that?

01:25:59.180 --> 01:26:00.350
I just gave you a raise.

01:26:02.120 --> 01:26:04.950
That's salary. I mean, a bonus.

01:26:04.960 --> 01:26:07.260
Bonuses come at the
end of the year.

01:26:16.130 --> 01:26:17.100
So, we're gonna call it in?

01:26:17.100 --> 01:26:19.370
We're gonna wait. For what?

01:26:19.370 --> 01:26:21.270
First, we want to see
if he's actually inside.

01:26:21.270 --> 01:26:23.610
And then, we want to find a more
interesting place to film the arrest.

01:26:24.810 --> 01:26:25.680
Like where?

01:26:28.810 --> 01:26:30.650
Anywhere we want.

01:26:30.650 --> 01:26:32.180
What we're going to do,
is we're gonna wait

01:26:32.180 --> 01:26:34.450
and then we're
gonna follow him.

01:26:34.450 --> 01:26:35.720
Then, when he reaches
what would be considered

01:26:35.720 --> 01:26:37.490
a better or more
populated neighborhood,

01:26:37.490 --> 01:26:39.460
then we'll report his
location to the police.

01:26:39.460 --> 01:26:40.990
He's a violent,
wanted criminal.

01:26:40.990 --> 01:26:42.060
I can't believe

01:26:42.060 --> 01:26:43.730
that he's just going to
peacefully surrender.

01:26:50.800 --> 01:26:52.370
Okay. I want more money.

01:26:53.370 --> 01:26:54.440
A lot more.

01:27:03.850 --> 01:27:05.720
What makes a job
desirable, Rick,

01:27:05.720 --> 01:27:07.850
isn't just the dollar
amount attached to it.

01:27:07.850 --> 01:27:10.090
You're at the ground floor
of a growing business.

01:27:10.090 --> 01:27:11.250
Your reward is a career.

01:27:11.260 --> 01:27:12.590
Fuck that.

01:27:12.590 --> 01:27:14.860
You're talking about some
seriously messed-up shit.

01:27:14.860 --> 01:27:16.530
You're expecting me

01:27:16.530 --> 01:27:19.430
to just go along with it.
I want more.

01:27:19.430 --> 01:27:20.860
I can't make people
do things, Rick.

01:27:20.870 --> 01:27:22.330
You have a choice if
you wanna do this.

01:27:22.330 --> 01:27:23.800
And I have a choice
if you don't.

01:27:26.040 --> 01:27:27.470
Are you threatening to fire me?

01:27:28.440 --> 01:27:30.210
Hey, I... I got something, too.

01:27:30.210 --> 01:27:31.770
How about not calling
in criminals,

01:27:31.780 --> 01:27:34.280
waiting for them to start
some shit so you can film it?

01:27:34.280 --> 01:27:35.880
That's against the fucking law.

01:27:35.880 --> 01:27:39.180
Yeah, cops would be majorly
interested in that, no doubt.

01:27:39.180 --> 01:27:41.850
Okay? So, I... I
want more money.

01:27:45.190 --> 01:27:46.960
We can re-open
negotiations, Rick.

01:27:47.890 --> 01:27:49.260
But, remember,

01:27:49.260 --> 01:27:50.930
when it comes to
your work reputation,

01:27:50.930 --> 01:27:53.560
you can't un-ring the bell.

01:27:53.560 --> 01:27:55.460
I want half of whatever
we make tonight.

01:27:57.100 --> 01:27:58.370
How did you arrive
at that number?

01:27:59.300 --> 01:28:01.700
There's two of us out here.

01:28:01.710 --> 01:28:03.740
So, 50-50.

01:28:03.740 --> 01:28:05.810
I'll counter at $10,000.

01:28:05.810 --> 01:28:07.240
You don't set the
numbers on this.

01:28:07.250 --> 01:28:09.450
I want half. I want half.

01:28:11.080 --> 01:28:12.280
If you're saying I
can't negotiate,

01:28:12.280 --> 01:28:13.780
then I guess I'm...

01:28:21.660 --> 01:28:24.130
I'm just gonna have
to give it to you.

01:28:27.100 --> 01:28:28.900
Well, all right, then.

01:28:28.900 --> 01:28:30.400
Oh...

01:28:30.400 --> 01:28:32.270
Now I can feel good
about it, at least.

01:28:32.270 --> 01:28:34.500
Now, I'll go the extra mile.

01:28:35.640 --> 01:28:37.340
That's what you never
understood, man.

01:28:37.340 --> 01:28:38.540
It's been the problem
the whole time.

01:28:41.510 --> 01:28:43.410
You gotta bring people in, Lou.
Seriously.

01:28:43.410 --> 01:28:46.280
You gotta talk to them like
they're fucking human beings.

01:28:46.280 --> 01:28:47.680
I'm saying this for you, dude.

01:28:47.690 --> 01:28:50.290
For the future, to help you.

01:28:50.290 --> 01:28:52.590
Because you got a seriously
weird-ass way of looking at shit.

01:28:53.990 --> 01:28:56.490
You know you do!

01:28:56.490 --> 01:28:57.930
You know what your
trouble is, man?

01:28:57.930 --> 01:28:59.430
You don't fucking
understand people.

01:29:01.970 --> 01:29:03.070
Okay?

01:29:03.800 --> 01:29:04.830
Mmm-hmm.

01:29:06.170 --> 01:29:08.040
I'll take the first watch.

01:29:09.140 --> 01:29:10.570
Okay.

01:29:34.970 --> 01:29:36.270
Rise and shine.

01:29:37.540 --> 01:29:38.830
He's leaving.

01:29:41.970 --> 01:29:43.070
Is that him?

01:29:43.070 --> 01:29:44.770
That's one of them.

01:30:27.590 --> 01:30:29.720
You're too fucking close, man.

01:30:29.720 --> 01:30:31.650
Oh, shit.

01:30:32.590 --> 01:30:34.190
You're too fucking close.

01:30:34.190 --> 01:30:35.620
This guy might have
already seen us,

01:30:35.630 --> 01:30:37.660
and he's bringing
us here as a trap.

01:30:39.260 --> 01:30:40.700
You ever think of that?

01:30:45.440 --> 01:30:46.670
Oh, shit.

01:31:26.240 --> 01:31:29.240
They're gonna see us. We're
in a red fucking car.

01:31:31.620 --> 01:31:33.980
Lower your window, please.

01:32:03.350 --> 01:32:04.480
Keep your window down.

01:32:04.480 --> 01:32:06.580
I'm fucking cold.

01:32:16.390 --> 01:32:17.760
Shit, they're parking.

01:32:18.560 --> 01:32:20.230
Keep going.

01:32:38.650 --> 01:32:39.850
<i> 911, what's your emergency?</i>

01:32:39.850 --> 01:32:40.980
Uh, yes, good evening.

01:32:40.990 --> 01:32:42.750
I'd like to report the
location of two men

01:32:42.750 --> 01:32:46.020
responsible for the triple murder
in Granada Hills last night.

01:32:46.020 --> 01:32:47.190
<i> What's your address?</i>

01:32:47.190 --> 01:32:49.060
Uh, I followed them,

01:32:49.060 --> 01:32:51.230
and they just pulled into the Chinatown
Express at Western and Third.

01:32:51.230 --> 01:32:53.060
Um, I can see them inside.

01:32:53.060 --> 01:32:55.160
<i> Okay, it's a restaurant
called Chinatown Express</i>

01:32:55.170 --> 01:32:56.670
<i> at Western and Third.</i>

01:32:56.670 --> 01:32:59.230
That's right. I can see them at
the counter and they're ordering.

01:32:59.240 --> 01:33:01.500
These men are wanted for the triple
murder in Granada Hills last night.

01:33:01.510 --> 01:33:03.570
<i> What's your name, sir?
</i> Louis Bloom.

01:33:03.570 --> 01:33:05.210
<i> Do you have a
description of the men?</i>

01:33:05.210 --> 01:33:06.940
Uh, yes, I do. They're
both Latin American men.

01:33:06.940 --> 01:33:09.910
Uh, probably what you
would call Hispanic.

01:33:09.910 --> 01:33:12.850
Uh, one is big, very
much on the heavy side.

01:33:12.850 --> 01:33:13.920
And the other's
face is scratched.

01:33:13.920 --> 01:33:15.720
He has scratches on his face.

01:33:15.720 --> 01:33:16.820
<i> How old are the men?</i>

01:33:17.920 --> 01:33:21.920
Uh, thirty. Perhaps, maybe, 35.

01:33:21.930 --> 01:33:24.060
<i> What are they wearing?</i>

01:33:24.060 --> 01:33:26.400
The big man is wearing light
pants and a striped sweater,

01:33:26.400 --> 01:33:28.800
and the man with scratches is
wearing brown pants and a vest.

01:33:28.800 --> 01:33:31.270
He looks like he has a gun.

01:33:32.370 --> 01:33:34.040
<i> You said</i> <i> the
suspect is armed?</i>

01:33:34.040 --> 01:33:35.740
I believe so, yes. I'm
sorry, I have to go.

01:33:35.740 --> 01:33:37.110
Otherwise, they might see me.

01:33:49.820 --> 01:33:51.750
<i> All west units,</i> <i> possible 187.</i>

01:33:51.760 --> 01:33:54.220
<i> Suspects there now.
Western and Third.</i>

01:33:54.230 --> 01:33:55.720
<i> Western and Third
at Chinatown Express.</i>

01:33:55.730 --> 01:33:57.430
<i> Suspects are two
male Hispanics.</i>

01:33:57.430 --> 01:33:59.250
<i> Number one, large build.</i>

01:33:59.250 --> 01:34:01.060
<i> Number two with</i> <i> scratches on
his face,</i> <i> inside the location.</i>

01:34:01.070 --> 01:34:06.100
<i> Possibly armed.</i> <i> Code
Three, incident 357 and 9753.</i>

01:34:06.100 --> 01:34:08.570
There's fucking
people in there.

01:34:08.570 --> 01:34:11.610
I count six.

01:34:11.610 --> 01:34:13.840
So, they could start shooting.

01:34:14.610 --> 01:34:15.780
They could.

01:34:15.780 --> 01:34:17.310
So you said we were waiting for

01:34:17.310 --> 01:34:18.680
a better neighborhood
with more people,

01:34:18.680 --> 01:34:19.980
not a fucking restaurant.

01:34:19.980 --> 01:34:21.630
We work with what we're given.

01:34:21.640 --> 01:34:23.290
<i> Unit 14, responding
to</i> <i> that Code Three.</i>

01:34:23.290 --> 01:34:24.650
You're going to go
down the street,

01:34:24.660 --> 01:34:26.320
get an angle inside
from over there.

01:34:27.420 --> 01:34:29.460
Steady hands. Use the zoom.

01:34:29.460 --> 01:34:30.860
No fast pans.

01:34:30.860 --> 01:34:32.460
I'll be filming from here.

01:34:32.460 --> 01:34:34.760
Fuck that. I'm not
getting out of the car!

01:34:37.000 --> 01:34:39.330
I need a second angle
from down the street.

01:34:39.340 --> 01:34:40.800
We'll cut it together.

01:34:40.800 --> 01:34:42.270
Two angles.

01:34:42.270 --> 01:34:44.840
Believe me, it's more
dangerous here in the car.

01:34:44.840 --> 01:34:46.810
I don't believe
anything you say.

01:34:46.810 --> 01:34:49.440
Man, this is fucked!

01:34:49.450 --> 01:34:52.050
Do you know I've never once
sworn in front of an employer?

01:34:52.050 --> 01:34:55.150
I am not doing it! I'm not
getting out of the car.

01:34:55.150 --> 01:34:56.890
You're making a mistake.

01:34:56.890 --> 01:34:59.760
I don't care about the
fucking job title.

01:35:05.360 --> 01:35:07.730
What if my problem wasn't that
I don't understand people,

01:35:07.730 --> 01:35:09.400
but that I don't like them?

01:35:12.700 --> 01:35:15.770
What if I was obliged to hurt
you for something like this?

01:35:17.340 --> 01:35:18.810
I mean, physically.

01:35:20.680 --> 01:35:23.050
I think you'd have to believe
afterwards, if you could,

01:35:23.050 --> 01:35:25.510
that agreeing to participate

01:35:25.520 --> 01:35:29.350
and then backing out at the
critical moment was a mistake.

01:35:29.350 --> 01:35:30.790
Because that's what
I'm telling you.

01:35:34.490 --> 01:35:39.600
As clearly as I can.

01:36:59.510 --> 01:37:02.380

01:41:01.920 --> 01:41:03.150
<i> 7-L-7 is now primary.</i>

01:41:03.150 --> 01:41:04.550
Lou, Lou, please.

01:41:04.560 --> 01:41:05.950
We're way too close.

01:41:08.360 --> 01:41:10.230
This guy's crazy. Fucking shit!

01:41:10.230 --> 01:41:11.660
<i> He's ramming my vehicle!</i>

01:41:11.660 --> 01:41:12.860
<i> All units. </i>
<i> Officer needs help.</i>

01:41:12.860 --> 01:41:14.530
<i> Northbound Western.</i>

01:41:14.530 --> 01:41:16.260
<i> Suspect now ramming
a police vehicle.</i>

01:41:16.270 --> 01:41:17.600
No matter what, keep shooting.

01:41:17.600 --> 01:41:19.200
<i> Continuing northbound.</i>

01:41:19.200 --> 01:41:20.270
Fuck!

01:41:20.900 --> 01:41:22.400
Oh, shit! Shit!

01:41:23.740 --> 01:41:25.170
Oh, my God!

01:41:35.120 --> 01:41:36.750
<i> 7-L-7, come in.</i>

01:41:39.790 --> 01:41:41.120
<i> 7-L-7, come in.</i>

01:41:41.120 --> 01:41:42.620
Turn off the car.

01:42:06.720 --> 01:42:07.980
He's dead.

01:42:07.990 --> 01:42:10.050
Get this shot.

01:42:24.600 --> 01:42:25.830
Steady hands.

01:42:31.070 --> 01:42:32.570
Use your zoom.

01:43:07.280 --> 01:43:09.280
Hold it right there!
Put the gun down!

01:43:25.030 --> 01:43:26.360
He had a weapon. That
was a just fire.

01:43:26.360 --> 01:43:27.560
He's not moving.

01:43:33.240 --> 01:43:34.300
Let's seal this off.

01:43:38.710 --> 01:43:40.380
You saw him.

01:43:44.050 --> 01:43:45.780
You saw him!

01:43:48.150 --> 01:43:52.890
I can't jeopardize
my company's success

01:43:52.890 --> 01:43:56.760
to retain an
untrustworthy employee.

01:43:58.860 --> 01:44:00.230
You're crazy.

01:44:02.730 --> 01:44:04.100
You're crazy!

01:44:05.570 --> 01:44:08.040
You took my bargaining
power, Rick.

01:44:08.040 --> 01:44:10.270
You used it against me.

01:44:10.270 --> 01:44:11.540
You would have done it again.

01:44:11.540 --> 01:44:12.940
Just admit it.

01:44:15.350 --> 01:44:16.680
I don't know.

01:44:19.020 --> 01:44:20.180
I don't know.

01:44:20.780 --> 01:44:22.120
I know.

01:44:25.060 --> 01:44:26.350
I know.

01:44:34.260 --> 01:44:37.270
Don't touch that unless it's for prints.
Make a clean sweep.

01:44:40.300 --> 01:44:42.200
Go around the vehicle.

01:44:46.580 --> 01:44:48.340
Let them through,
here they come.

01:45:07.960 --> 01:45:09.560
Hello, Juliana.

01:45:10.900 --> 01:45:12.500
Hello, Willy.

01:45:18.580 --> 01:45:20.140
- Hello, Ben. Hello, Lisa.
- Hi!

01:45:20.140 --> 01:45:21.240
Hey. It's Lou, right?

01:45:21.240 --> 01:45:22.510
Yes, that's right!

01:45:22.510 --> 01:45:23.810
Video News? That's right.

01:45:23.810 --> 01:45:25.150
You got something
good for us tonight?

01:45:25.150 --> 01:45:27.420
I think so. I'm about
to show Nina right now.

01:45:27.420 --> 01:45:29.750
I can tell by your
tie, it's Friday.

01:46:07.960 --> 01:46:09.720
You can leave.

01:46:19.700 --> 01:46:21.900
Wasn't that your partner?

01:46:23.310 --> 01:46:25.410
As a matter of
fact, that's him.

01:46:27.640 --> 01:46:29.480
Oh, I'm floored.

01:46:30.210 --> 01:46:32.650
I mean, it's amazing.

01:46:33.480 --> 01:46:34.980
Thank you.

01:46:35.850 --> 01:46:38.650
I mean, just amazing.

01:46:40.760 --> 01:46:42.690
Thank you.

01:46:42.690 --> 01:46:44.290
No, thank you.

01:46:45.730 --> 01:46:47.600
Thank you for
bringing it to me.

01:46:48.900 --> 01:46:50.600
You're welcome.

01:46:52.540 --> 01:46:54.240
I want it, obviously.

01:46:54.240 --> 01:46:56.100
How much do you want it?

01:46:58.040 --> 01:46:59.670
You tell me.

01:47:01.750 --> 01:47:04.080
Get this to graphics.

01:47:04.080 --> 01:47:05.080
Who's in charge here?

01:47:05.080 --> 01:47:06.280
Who are you?

01:47:06.280 --> 01:47:08.180
LAPD. Major case.

01:47:08.180 --> 01:47:09.420
Pull the footage
from these screens.

01:47:09.420 --> 01:47:10.750
Round it up. Let's go.
All copies.

01:47:10.750 --> 01:47:12.620
Excuse me.

01:47:12.620 --> 01:47:14.690
I'm the news director.
Can I help you?

01:47:14.690 --> 01:47:15.890
You can help yourself

01:47:15.890 --> 01:47:17.630
by collecting up every
copy of the shootout

01:47:17.630 --> 01:47:19.290
the chase, the crash, all of it.
Now.

01:47:19.300 --> 01:47:21.060
It's KWLA property.

01:47:21.060 --> 01:47:22.900
It's evidence. Of what?

01:47:22.900 --> 01:47:25.230
I got a cop near death
in the hospital,

01:47:25.240 --> 01:47:27.100
three dead, four wounded,

01:47:27.100 --> 01:47:29.240
and a dozen major crimes
stretching a mile of Third.

01:47:29.240 --> 01:47:30.540
This tape is evidence.

01:47:30.540 --> 01:47:32.270
It's news footage
bought and paid for

01:47:32.280 --> 01:47:33.710
from an independent contractor.

01:47:33.710 --> 01:47:35.080
And how do you think he got it?

01:47:35.080 --> 01:47:36.710
If there's an issue,
speak to him.

01:47:36.710 --> 01:47:37.910
Don't get in the way of this.

01:47:37.910 --> 01:47:39.380
Unless you have
a judge's order,

01:47:39.380 --> 01:47:40.550
we're going with
it in four minutes.

01:47:40.550 --> 01:47:42.120
Hey.

01:47:42.120 --> 01:47:43.620
Isn't that him?

01:47:48.390 --> 01:47:49.890
Camera One, stay centered up.

01:47:52.600 --> 01:47:54.130
Camera Two, we'll do a
zoom out when we come out.

01:47:55.930 --> 01:47:58.670
Joel has got a source on the
taskforce who says they found drugs

01:47:58.670 --> 01:48:00.340
at the Granada Hills house.

01:48:00.340 --> 01:48:03.840
Cocaine in wrapped packages hidden
in crawlspaces. Over 50 pounds.

01:48:03.840 --> 01:48:06.740
He confirmed it with an
investigator at the scene.

01:48:06.740 --> 01:48:09.340
It wasn't a home invasion.
It was a drug robbery.

01:48:09.350 --> 01:48:10.850
Give it to the noon crew.

01:48:12.180 --> 01:48:13.180
This is news.

01:48:13.180 --> 01:48:14.980
It detracts from the story.

01:48:14.990 --> 01:48:16.850
It is the story.

01:48:16.850 --> 01:48:19.790
The story is urban crime
creeping into the suburbs.

01:48:19.790 --> 01:48:22.020
That's the story.

01:48:22.030 --> 01:48:23.690
Jesus, you sound like Lou.

01:48:23.690 --> 01:48:25.260
Ten seconds to back.

01:48:25.260 --> 01:48:28.830
I think Lou is inspiring all
of us to reach a little higher.

01:48:28.830 --> 01:48:33.870
Five, four, three, two, one.
Sting it.

01:48:35.510 --> 01:48:37.770
Mics. Dissolve.

01:48:48.790 --> 01:48:50.790
You understand that you've
been read your rights,

01:48:50.790 --> 01:48:52.820
and you're here voluntarily?

01:48:52.820 --> 01:48:54.520
That's right. Yes.

01:48:55.660 --> 01:48:58.490
And this is being
recorded and filmed?

01:48:58.500 --> 01:49:00.260
<i> Yes, from the
camera</i> <i> up there.</i>

01:49:00.960 --> 01:49:02.430
<i> Wide angle.</i>

01:49:02.830 --> 01:49:03.870
Mmm-hmm.

01:49:07.570 --> 01:49:09.300
Would you tell me
how it is you were

01:49:09.310 --> 01:49:10.710
at the Chinatown
Express tonight

01:49:10.710 --> 01:49:12.070
and called the 911?

01:49:12.080 --> 01:49:13.310
Of course.

01:49:13.310 --> 01:49:15.110
It began earlier in the day.

01:49:16.480 --> 01:49:18.480
I was watering my plant.

01:49:19.680 --> 01:49:22.250
I looked out my window
at my apartment.

01:49:22.250 --> 01:49:25.520
The one you visited.

01:49:25.520 --> 01:49:28.720
I saw a dark-colored vehicle with two
men inside parked across the street.

01:49:28.730 --> 01:49:29.820
I didn't think anything of it,

01:49:29.830 --> 01:49:30.790
otherwise I would
have reported it then.

01:49:32.430 --> 01:49:34.130
We began our night,

01:49:37.670 --> 01:49:40.500
my employee and myself.

01:49:40.500 --> 01:49:43.500
And around approximately 12:38,

01:49:43.510 --> 01:49:45.440
I looked in my rearview mirror

01:49:45.440 --> 01:49:47.510
and I saw what looked
like the same men

01:49:47.510 --> 01:49:49.680
in the same vehicle
following us.

01:49:49.680 --> 01:49:51.180
I made an evasive maneuver.

01:49:51.180 --> 01:49:54.180
I circled back and tailed
them to the restaurant.

01:49:54.180 --> 01:49:55.850
At which point, I
saw them go inside

01:49:55.850 --> 01:49:58.620
and recognized them as the same
men from the home invasion.

01:49:59.620 --> 01:50:01.720
You told me you
didn't see the men.

01:50:01.720 --> 01:50:03.590
That you didn't get
a good look at them.

01:50:03.590 --> 01:50:06.560
Well, it all came back to
me when I saw them going in.

01:50:06.560 --> 01:50:10.030
Their shapes and
their movements.

01:50:10.030 --> 01:50:12.570
And then I saw that one of the
men had a gun under his shirt,

01:50:12.570 --> 01:50:15.740
so I immediately got my
phone and dialed 911.

01:50:15.740 --> 01:50:17.370
That's your story?

01:50:17.370 --> 01:50:19.540
That's what happened. That's
why I'm sitting here with you.

01:50:19.540 --> 01:50:21.980
I think that the
men saw my footage

01:50:22.880 --> 01:50:25.480
and they tracked me down.

01:50:25.480 --> 01:50:27.220
You want to know what I think?

01:50:28.320 --> 01:50:30.820
Yes, please.

01:50:30.820 --> 01:50:34.060
I think you withheld
information.

01:50:34.060 --> 01:50:36.990
I think you saw the two men in
the murder house in Granada Hills

01:50:36.990 --> 01:50:41.230
and you saw the car
and you sat on it

01:50:41.230 --> 01:50:43.600
to get something
you could film.

01:50:43.600 --> 01:50:45.670
What do you think about that?

01:50:47.400 --> 01:50:49.600
I think that would be

01:50:49.610 --> 01:50:52.410
a very unprofessional thing
for me to do in my business.

01:50:52.410 --> 01:50:54.680
It would be murder.

01:50:54.680 --> 01:50:56.080
I can understand why
you're looking into it,

01:50:56.080 --> 01:50:57.610
but I didn't do
anything like that.

01:50:57.610 --> 01:50:59.080
Nothing that could
be considered wrong.

01:50:59.080 --> 01:51:00.580
You don't fool me for a minute.

01:51:00.580 --> 01:51:02.580
I'm glad.

01:51:02.590 --> 01:51:06.020
I think everything
you said is a lie.

01:51:06.020 --> 01:51:08.320
I wish my partner was here
to back up what happened.

01:51:08.320 --> 01:51:10.190
You left your dead partner.

01:51:10.190 --> 01:51:11.460
No, the ambulances arrived.

01:51:11.460 --> 01:51:13.030
They're trained professionals.

01:51:13.030 --> 01:51:14.930
Yeah, and you seem real
broken up about that.

01:51:15.370 --> 01:51:17.000
No, um...

01:51:17.000 --> 01:51:18.930
He died doing what he loved.

01:51:20.470 --> 01:51:23.040
You filmed him dying.

01:51:25.110 --> 01:51:27.180
<i> Yeah. That's what I do.
</i> <i> It's my job.</i>

01:51:27.180 --> 01:51:28.610
<i> I like to say that
if you're seeing me,</i>

01:51:28.610 --> 01:51:30.780
<i> you're having</i> <i> the
worst day</i> <i> of your life.</i>

01:52:03.650 --> 01:52:04.810
<i> Any Rampart unit,</i>

01:52:04.810 --> 01:52:07.050
<i> ambulance to 11 Rampart
on Second Avenue.</i>

01:52:07.050 --> 01:52:09.450
<i> Victim, female, white.
Unknown property taken.</i>

01:52:28.500 --> 01:52:29.840
<i> Congratulations.</i>

01:52:32.340 --> 01:52:35.180
Congratulations.

01:52:35.180 --> 01:52:37.110
Your selection by
Video Production News

01:52:37.110 --> 01:52:38.780
is evidence of the hiring
committee's recognition

01:52:38.780 --> 01:52:42.720
of your employment history and
unique personal qualities.

01:52:42.720 --> 01:52:44.920
It is my hope that through
hard work and commitment,

01:52:44.920 --> 01:52:46.890
you will move through
the intern program

01:52:46.890 --> 01:52:49.020
and continue to pursue
your career goals

01:52:49.030 --> 01:52:52.890
as full-time employees
of Video Production News.

01:52:52.900 --> 01:52:54.930
I can tell you from experience

01:52:54.930 --> 01:52:57.930
that the surest way up the
ladder is to listen carefully

01:52:57.930 --> 01:53:00.470
and follow my orders.

01:53:00.470 --> 01:53:04.540
You may be confused at times,
and other times, unsure.

01:53:04.540 --> 01:53:08.540
But remember, I will never
ask you to do anything

01:53:09.880 --> 01:53:12.210
that I wouldn't do myself.
