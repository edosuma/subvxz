WEBVTT

00:52.761 --> 00:57.724
[Grant] Pray hear a tale of wizardry
about the brave knight Gerwain.

00:59.809 --> 01:01.144
[groans]

01:04.606 --> 01:06.357
Gerwain wielded as a weapon,

01:06.441 --> 01:08.610
a mysterious force.

01:08.693 --> 01:12.072
A force which caused his enemies
to fall before him,

01:12.697 --> 01:15.617
their heads to drop like apples
from a tree.

01:15.700 --> 01:17.786
Uh, you mean like a natural phenomenon

01:17.869 --> 01:19.871
by which all things with energy
are bought towards each other?

01:20.455 --> 01:21.581
Must be, I suppose.

01:22.665 --> 01:25.001
[Grant] Gerwain had but one weakness
in his body...

01:26.336 --> 01:28.838
another body to whom he was attracted.

01:29.464 --> 01:32.092
-How attracted?
-Attractive force is proportional

01:32.175 --> 01:33.218
to the product of their masses

01:33.301 --> 01:35.929
and inversely proportional to the square
of the distance between them.

01:36.513 --> 01:38.515
Last I heard,
he was a couple of leagues away.

01:39.682 --> 01:41.768
[Grant] To sap his mystical force...

01:42.560 --> 01:44.020
No. No!

01:44.103 --> 01:47.106
-his enemies did kidnap his betrothed.
-[woman screams]

01:49.734 --> 01:52.070
Gerwain rushed to her rescue...

01:52.987 --> 01:54.489
-[woman groaning]
-[laughing]

01:55.490 --> 01:59.619
the force increasing with each turn
and every acceleration.

02:02.747 --> 02:04.624
But alas, it was a trap.

02:11.548 --> 02:14.551
-For a moment, his will seemed broken.
-[laughing]

02:14.634 --> 02:15.510
[laughing]

02:17.554 --> 02:18.638
[laughing continues]

02:18.721 --> 02:21.266
Then Gerwain drew upon all his powers...

02:21.891 --> 02:23.560
Oh, she died beautifully.

02:26.271 --> 02:27.981
unleashing forces positive...

02:28.857 --> 02:30.483
negative,

02:30.567 --> 02:32.193
and lateral.

02:32.777 --> 02:34.737
Gee, his force has increased.

02:35.947 --> 02:37.490
[both grunting]

02:37.574 --> 02:39.159
Gee, that hurt.

02:43.204 --> 02:44.455
[Grant] Driven by revenge,

02:44.539 --> 02:46.833
Gerwain entered the forbidden forest...

02:48.960 --> 02:50.545
-[horse neighs]
-but foul play was afoot.

02:50.628 --> 02:51.963
[laughing]

02:58.344 --> 02:59.304
[Falcor] Lightning bolt.

02:59.387 --> 03:00.555
[grunts]

03:01.347 --> 03:02.932
-Light hits.
-You're dead.

03:03.016 --> 03:06.853
Shut up, Falcor. You can't throw
three lightning bolts in one round.

03:06.936 --> 03:08.313
-You're not high enough level.
-[Falcor] Uh-huh.

03:08.396 --> 03:10.523
Last weekend,
I did a side quest and leveled up.

03:10.607 --> 03:11.441
Liar!

03:11.524 --> 03:12.775
You're always cheating.

03:12.859 --> 03:15.028
You always play like this. I'm leaving.

03:15.612 --> 03:17.447
-You're always picking on the wizard.
-[Grant] Fine!

03:17.530 --> 03:19.198
Ride off into the sunset.

03:19.282 --> 03:20.950
See if I care.

03:21.826 --> 03:23.286
I'm already dead.

03:23.369 --> 03:25.622
You don't play
by any of the real rules. Look.

03:25.705 --> 03:27.957
She's taking a selfie.
This isn't even fair.

03:31.002 --> 03:32.420
What did I just see?

03:32.503 --> 03:35.298
Did you not pay attention
to any part of the narrative?

03:35.381 --> 03:37.592
You and your friends get together
on the weekends

03:37.675 --> 03:39.135
and play Lord of the Rings?

03:39.219 --> 03:41.346
First of all,
it's not just on the weekends.

03:41.429 --> 03:45.391
And secondly, it's called LARPing,
which stands for live action role-play.

03:45.475 --> 03:47.060
You just got nerd-checked.

03:47.143 --> 03:49.354
So, our topic is g-forces

03:49.437 --> 03:52.815
and how people experience
and survive high Gs.

03:53.942 --> 03:55.610
[Grant]
We're going down the rabbit hole...

03:55.693 --> 03:56.903
[yelling]

03:57.904 --> 04:00.990
to find out who has the highest g-force
of all.

04:01.074 --> 04:02.617
[Grant grunting]

04:02.700 --> 04:04.953
Oh, that was definitely a lot of Gs
right there.

04:05.536 --> 04:08.748
In the mix, a human crash test dummy...

04:10.583 --> 04:11.584
race car drivers...

04:12.585 --> 04:15.213
[Kari] Feels like the butterflies
in my stomach are in my mouth.

04:15.296 --> 04:18.675
and a g-force showdown
between a roller coaster...

04:18.758 --> 04:20.176
[screaming]

04:22.053 --> 04:23.972
and an Olympic bobsled.

04:24.931 --> 04:25.807
[Tory] Holy crap.

04:28.685 --> 04:33.064
[Grant] As usual, we'll score and rank
our six contenders using three criteria.

04:33.564 --> 04:34.899
Number of Gs,

04:35.316 --> 04:37.986
duration of Gs and extreme factor.

04:39.070 --> 04:40.071
[groans]

04:40.154 --> 04:41.698
What exactly is with the knights?

04:42.240 --> 04:43.950
Behold, fair maiden.

04:45.410 --> 04:46.828
[grunting]

04:46.911 --> 04:49.038
-Jousting?
-Jousting.

04:49.122 --> 04:52.041
I figured if we're gonna be
investigating g-force,

04:52.125 --> 04:53.543
why not go back in time

04:53.626 --> 04:56.796
and find the oldest example
of extreme Gs?

04:56.879 --> 04:58.506
Jousting is at the top of the list.

04:58.589 --> 05:00.591
Prepare to get medieval.

05:02.677 --> 05:04.595
[snorting]

05:09.017 --> 05:10.310
[neighs]

05:10.393 --> 05:14.897
My lords and ladies,
are you ready for a joust?

05:14.981 --> 05:17.233
[Grant] Excuse me. Sorry, sorry.

05:17.317 --> 05:18.151
-Sorry.
-[men yell]

05:18.234 --> 05:21.070
Are you ready for imperial mayhem?

05:21.738 --> 05:23.197
-Um, excuse me, I've just--
-Oh.

05:23.281 --> 05:25.366
-Uh, right over here. Sorry.
-Oh. Oh, sorry.

05:25.450 --> 05:29.245
And watch two grown men
knock the snot out of each other?

05:29.829 --> 05:32.248
[Grant]
Knights. Always with the anger issues.

05:32.332 --> 05:34.167
Raise your voices!

05:34.250 --> 05:35.543
[all yelling]

05:39.964 --> 05:41.716
[Grant] That is Charlie Andrews.

05:41.799 --> 05:44.218
He's a ten-time world jousting champion

05:44.302 --> 05:45.970
and founder of the Knights of Mayhem.

05:46.054 --> 05:48.222
This is one guy you don't wanna mess with.

05:48.306 --> 05:51.392
[shouting] Yeah!

05:51.476 --> 05:55.021
If there's anybody that can tell me
about jousting, it's him.

06:02.779 --> 06:04.363
Charge on!

06:12.580 --> 06:13.414
[Grant] Wow.

06:14.457 --> 06:15.917
This is violent.

06:18.211 --> 06:19.837
And where there's violence...

06:21.297 --> 06:22.507
there's g-forces.

06:22.590 --> 06:23.925
[all cheering]

06:24.509 --> 06:27.136
I'm here to figure out how
to measure these medieval Gs...

06:28.888 --> 06:29.931
which means data.

06:31.891 --> 06:33.101
Lots of data.

06:33.184 --> 06:35.103
Charlie, that was amazing.

06:35.186 --> 06:37.522
-[whoops] Good hard hitting, man.
-[chuckling]

06:37.605 --> 06:41.442
What I need is some facts and figures
about jousting.

06:41.526 --> 06:43.694
Speaking of horsepower,
how fast do they run?

06:43.778 --> 06:46.030
Between 15 miles an hour

06:46.114 --> 06:47.865
to 25 miles an hour.

06:47.949 --> 06:49.784
How much does an average rider weigh?

06:49.867 --> 06:51.369
Between about 180 pounds

06:51.452 --> 06:53.412
to 250 pounds.

06:53.496 --> 06:56.415
My suit runs about 130 pounds, 140.

06:56.499 --> 07:00.211
-This here is 10-foot-6-inches long.
-Okay.

07:00.294 --> 07:02.296
Solid hemlock, inch and a quarter.

07:02.380 --> 07:04.674
-If you notice the grids on here...
-Yeah.

07:04.757 --> 07:07.218
Those grids are designed
to catch the lance.

07:07.301 --> 07:10.346
They get 100% of all the g-forces.

07:10.430 --> 07:11.931
That's what we're looking for.

07:13.474 --> 07:15.393
I'm measuring jousting Gs.

07:18.438 --> 07:20.815
But there's no way I can capture
raw data

07:21.399 --> 07:22.900
without a dry run.

07:24.902 --> 07:27.280
To get definitive results
in the heat of battle,

07:27.363 --> 07:31.242
we first need to test the sensors
and software under fire in the lab.

07:32.827 --> 07:33.786
[man] Oh!

07:35.121 --> 07:37.039
This is exactly why, Grant,

07:37.123 --> 07:38.499
I should've stayed in school.

07:38.583 --> 07:41.461
Because then I could go back to the shop
and use a simulator,

07:41.544 --> 07:43.504
I wouldn't have to be
the crash test dummy.

07:43.588 --> 07:45.089
Where would be the fun in that?

07:45.965 --> 07:47.717
You're right. Joust do it.

07:51.888 --> 07:53.389
[Grant] I'm back at the shop...

07:54.599 --> 07:57.059
and getting the team together
to replicate...

07:58.895 --> 08:00.104
test out...

08:02.523 --> 08:03.566
and measure...

08:03.649 --> 08:05.735
[all laughing]

08:05.818 --> 08:07.320
some medieval Gs.

08:09.197 --> 08:10.114
[whirring]

08:10.198 --> 08:13.242
And in order to do that,
we need to build a rail system.

08:13.743 --> 08:15.536
There's gonna be two rails.

08:16.120 --> 08:18.873
One rail is going to be our target.

08:18.956 --> 08:20.791
A guy in a suit of armor.

08:21.501 --> 08:23.628
The other rail is gonna be our lance.

08:24.337 --> 08:28.508
We're going to pull back the bungees,
just like a slingshot,

08:28.591 --> 08:30.927
and then fire them at each other.

08:33.971 --> 08:37.808
Those are the two rails,
and on the rails go two sleds.

08:37.892 --> 08:41.562
Each sled has to replicate
the speed of a galloping horse.

08:42.188 --> 08:45.233
So, we need to top out between
20 and 30 miles per hour.

08:45.316 --> 08:47.151
This is gonna be fantastic.

08:49.111 --> 08:52.448
With the first sled in place
and the bungees looped and tied,

08:52.532 --> 08:54.659
it's time for a quick systems check.

08:54.742 --> 08:57.662
Okay, let me walk you through
our whole setup here.

08:57.745 --> 08:59.205
Starting off with the winch.

08:59.288 --> 09:02.375
The winch is used to tension up
the bungee cords.

09:02.458 --> 09:06.128
It's gonna be removed
once we click into the quick release.

09:06.671 --> 09:11.008
The quick release allows us to be far away
while this thing fires off.

09:11.092 --> 09:14.512
Here's the sled.
It's gonna be un-weighted for this test

09:14.595 --> 09:17.932
because we just wanna see
how the bungees are gonna perform.

09:19.058 --> 09:21.394
Okay, pin is in.

09:21.477 --> 09:24.438
This is the bungee cord.
It's the source of propulsion.

09:25.565 --> 09:26.607
Pin's out.

09:26.691 --> 09:28.651
And the tire is gonna stop the sled.

09:28.734 --> 09:30.194
Radar standing by.

09:30.278 --> 09:32.321
-Radar is ready.
-Here we go.

09:32.905 --> 09:34.991
Three, two, one.

09:37.451 --> 09:40.454
Yes, 26 miles an hour!

09:42.832 --> 09:45.835
Perfect. Galloping horse speed, check.

09:45.918 --> 09:47.628
It's almost like we know what we're doing.

09:47.878 --> 09:48.879
[whirring]

09:50.965 --> 09:53.342
Now for the horses, knight...

09:53.426 --> 09:56.178
-Do not impale him on the pole.
-[man chuckles]

09:58.180 --> 09:59.223
and lances.

10:00.057 --> 10:01.017
Let's joust.

10:02.059 --> 10:04.562
And now for the most important part
of this experiment,

10:04.645 --> 10:05.771
our accelerometer.

10:05.855 --> 10:08.983
It's gonna help us determine
how many Gs our knight experiences

10:09.066 --> 10:10.568
during his rapid deceleration.

10:12.194 --> 10:15.114
I'm placing one directly
behind the impact plate,

10:16.115 --> 10:17.992
but that's likely to get smashed.

10:18.075 --> 10:20.745
So, I'm putting another away
from the line of fire

10:20.828 --> 10:23.205
to see if it records the same data.

10:23.706 --> 10:26.584
Yeah!

10:26.667 --> 10:29.128
[Grant]
I really don't wanna upset Charlie.

10:29.211 --> 10:30.880
So, this had better work.

10:30.963 --> 10:33.341
Here's where we're at.
We've built two tracks,

10:33.424 --> 10:35.760
each about 50 feet long, and two sleds.

10:37.345 --> 10:39.847
Sled number one has 300 pounds
of knight on it.

10:39.930 --> 10:43.934
That's 180 pounds of guy
plus 120 pounds of armor.

10:45.811 --> 10:46.979
Okay, we're locked.

10:48.397 --> 10:52.026
Sled number two has our lance.
That's an eight-foot-long wood dowel.

10:52.109 --> 10:55.780
Plus, another 300 pounds to simulate
the weight of the other knight.

10:55.863 --> 10:58.157
Okay, now's the time for danger.

10:59.116 --> 11:00.743
And if everything works out,

11:00.826 --> 11:04.497
both the lance and the knight will meet
right in the middle of the impact zone,

11:04.580 --> 11:05.915
and we'll get g-force data.

11:06.582 --> 11:07.625
Let's do this.

11:10.378 --> 11:13.464
Okay, here we go.
This is head-to-head jousting simulator

11:13.547 --> 11:14.715
in three...

11:15.966 --> 11:16.884
two...

11:18.010 --> 11:18.844
one.

11:21.305 --> 11:22.723
Yes!

11:28.521 --> 11:29.563
Success.

11:32.108 --> 11:33.776
But before we download the data,

11:33.859 --> 11:35.194
we're gonna run multiple tests

11:35.277 --> 11:37.613
to see if those accelerometers
can take a beating.

11:37.696 --> 11:38.864
One.

11:50.418 --> 11:51.752
Okay.

11:52.336 --> 11:53.421
Let's see what we got.

11:56.006 --> 11:58.259
Looks like my g-force meter survived,

11:58.342 --> 12:00.136
which means we're in business.

12:00.219 --> 12:03.806
At the moment of impact,
we got a peak of 2.8 Gs.

12:03.889 --> 12:04.974
Here's the best part.

12:05.057 --> 12:07.101
The data from the front accelerometer

12:07.184 --> 12:10.271
exactly matches the data
from the rear accelerometer,

12:10.354 --> 12:11.772
which means we can put our sensor

12:11.856 --> 12:12.982
anywhere on the knight

12:13.065 --> 12:14.525
and get consistent data.

12:15.651 --> 12:17.319
Aw, this is gonna be fun. All right.

12:17.403 --> 12:19.363
G-force science is complex.

12:19.447 --> 12:20.781
So, let's remind ourselves

12:20.865 --> 12:23.325
how we're gonna score
our g-force contenders.

12:23.409 --> 12:25.161
Number 1, total number of Gs.

12:25.244 --> 12:27.913
Number 2, duration the Gs are sustained.

12:27.997 --> 12:30.332
And number 3, the extreme factor.

12:30.416 --> 12:33.002
How the body feels the Gs,
how they experience them.

12:33.085 --> 12:35.463
Now, in case you were asleep
in science class,

12:35.546 --> 12:38.048
-I did a little educational video for you.
-Ooh...

12:38.132 --> 12:39.008
[all chuckling]

12:39.091 --> 12:41.385
G-force stands for gravitational force.

12:41.844 --> 12:42.928
You know, gravity.

12:43.262 --> 12:46.557
A ride on a swing is a perfect example
of g-force in motion.

12:46.640 --> 12:50.519
At the top of the arc, I get
to that weightless feeling of zero-g.

12:51.020 --> 12:53.647
And as I go down on the swing,
at the bottom of the arc,

12:53.731 --> 12:56.400
I hit my maximum deceleration of 2 G.

12:56.984 --> 13:00.863
Taking off in a commercial airplane,
1.2 to 1.4 Gs.

13:01.614 --> 13:05.534
Bungee jumping, 2.8 to 3.5 Gs.

13:05.618 --> 13:07.036
Pretty bad idea but...

13:08.162 --> 13:09.205
[groans]

13:09.288 --> 13:11.957
You ride your bike
into a wall, that's 5 to 10 Gs.

13:12.041 --> 13:13.667
Plopping down in a chair...

13:14.502 --> 13:16.420
Ten Gs, but just for an instant.

13:16.504 --> 13:17.421
Hey, what's up?

13:17.505 --> 13:18.881
-What'd the five fingers say to the face?
-What?

13:19.632 --> 13:20.966
-Slap.
-Hey!

13:21.050 --> 13:24.678
Tory just experienced hundreds of Gs.
But only for an instant.

13:25.262 --> 13:28.307
Sustained over a long period of time,
that would tear your body apart.

13:28.891 --> 13:30.309
We should watch that again.

13:33.020 --> 13:34.313
Class dismissed.

13:35.940 --> 13:39.568
Time for my first g-force
junkie contender.

13:40.778 --> 13:42.988
My contender isn't a thing. It's a guy.

13:43.948 --> 13:45.366
Colonel John Paul Stapp.

13:45.449 --> 13:48.577
This guy did everything but kill himself
on his g-force day job.

13:48.661 --> 13:51.997
[announcer] Lieutenant Colonel John Stapp
is ready for the fastest ride on earth.

13:52.081 --> 13:56.877
In 1947, he embarked on a top-secret
biophysics experiment...

13:56.961 --> 13:58.587
One. Fire.

13:59.755 --> 14:03.551
to explore the outer limits of
the human g-force endurance.

14:04.760 --> 14:05.761
During World War II,

14:05.844 --> 14:09.265
it was thought the pilots could
withstand a max of 18 Gs.

14:11.141 --> 14:13.894
But Stapp,
a medical doctor with the US Air Force,

14:13.978 --> 14:14.895
didn't buy those numbers.

14:15.479 --> 14:18.232
He set out to prove that pilots
could withstand higher Gs,

14:18.315 --> 14:20.234
and therefore needed
much more protection.

14:20.776 --> 14:23.988
To do that,
he needed an extreme g-force machine.

14:24.071 --> 14:27.575
[announcer] Crewmen fasten Colonel Stapp
in with a network of belts and straps.

14:27.658 --> 14:30.202
[Kari] A rocket sled called the Gee Whiz.

14:30.286 --> 14:33.581
Before Stapp, the only guy cleared
to ride on the Gee Whiz:

14:34.081 --> 14:36.876
Oscar 8,
the world's first crash test dummy.

14:36.959 --> 14:38.002
And this is why.

14:40.170 --> 14:42.089
When the Gee Whiz hit the water brake,

14:42.590 --> 14:44.550
Oscar hit massive Gs.

14:44.633 --> 14:46.552
He sailed through the wooden windscreen,

14:47.136 --> 14:51.348
left his face behind,
and came to rest 700 feet downrange.

14:52.099 --> 14:53.475
Who'd want that job?

14:54.018 --> 14:54.977
Step up Stapp.

14:55.060 --> 14:57.938
He knew that the only way
to really find out

14:58.022 --> 14:59.940
what g-force did to the human body

15:00.024 --> 15:01.400
was to ditch Oscar

15:01.483 --> 15:03.235
and use a human guinea pig.

15:03.319 --> 15:06.030
Five, four, three,

15:06.113 --> 15:07.990
two, one.

15:08.073 --> 15:09.158
Fire.

15:15.247 --> 15:17.207
[Kari] During the summer of 1948,

15:17.291 --> 15:19.835
he completed a hair-raising 16 runs

15:19.919 --> 15:22.630
that peaked at 35 Gs on braking.

15:26.759 --> 15:31.221
He almost doubled the previously
accepted ceiling for survivable Gs.

15:31.305 --> 15:35.225
[announcer] Colonel Stapp learns
he has just traveled 421 miles per hour.

15:38.062 --> 15:40.314
[Kari] When Chuck Yeager broke
the speed of sound,

15:40.397 --> 15:41.690
Stapp wanted to find out

15:41.774 --> 15:46.236
how to protect pilots during supersonic
emergency ejections.

15:46.820 --> 15:48.030
I know, crazy.

15:48.113 --> 15:49.990
So, in December 1954,

15:50.074 --> 15:53.994
protected only by a helmet and a visor,
he strapped in,

15:54.078 --> 15:57.539
inserted a rubber bite block
equipped with an accelerometer

15:57.623 --> 15:59.249
and the countdown began.

15:59.333 --> 16:01.877
[man] Four, three, two,

16:02.628 --> 16:04.463
one, zero.

16:08.258 --> 16:11.679
[Kari] Stapp hit 632 miles per hour.

16:12.554 --> 16:14.473
Two tons of wind pressure.

16:14.556 --> 16:16.058
And when he hit those water tanks,

16:16.642 --> 16:19.645
he experienced an enormous
negative acceleration.

16:21.230 --> 16:25.275
He peaked at a fraction of a second
at 46.2 Gs.

16:25.859 --> 16:28.779
But it's the sustained Gs
that are the most impressive.

16:28.862 --> 16:30.906
For 1.1 seconds,

16:30.990 --> 16:34.493
Stapp endured 25 Gs,

16:34.576 --> 16:38.205
thought to be the highest sustained Gs
ever survived.

16:40.290 --> 16:44.378
His eyeballs were filled with blood
from burst capillaries.

16:45.254 --> 16:47.840
It was like a scene from a horror movie.

16:48.924 --> 16:52.511
They thought he'd gone blind,
but after ten terrifying minutes,

16:52.594 --> 16:53.554
his vision returned.

16:53.637 --> 16:57.057
And the legend went on to live a long,
and presumably,

16:57.141 --> 16:58.183
slower-paced life.

16:58.767 --> 17:00.894
Ah, those were the good old days.

17:00.978 --> 17:05.190
[Kari] By putting his body on the line,
Stapp saved the lives of countless pilots.

17:05.274 --> 17:09.361
And he taught us much
of what we know about the power of Gs.

17:09.945 --> 17:11.780
Those were seriously
impressive numbers.

17:11.864 --> 17:13.657
A peak of 46.2 Gs

17:13.741 --> 17:16.994
and 25 Gs sustained for 1.1 seconds.

17:17.077 --> 17:19.371
And he's an officer.
He didn't have to do this.

17:19.455 --> 17:21.915
He could put a low ranking guinea pig
in that seat,

17:21.999 --> 17:24.209
but he didn't want anybody else
in harm's way.

17:24.293 --> 17:27.504
Not to mention the countless lives
he saved by making cockpits safer

17:27.588 --> 17:30.215
and being an advocate for car seatbelts.

17:35.054 --> 17:37.056
[Grant] For my next g-force contender...

17:39.683 --> 17:40.684
a roller coaster.

17:41.268 --> 17:44.188
And I have a bet with Tory
that it'll beat a bobsled

17:44.271 --> 17:45.773
in a g-force showdown.

17:50.235 --> 17:51.528
[all shriek]

17:55.908 --> 17:57.701
This is the West Edmonton Mall,

17:58.285 --> 18:00.454
the largest mall in North America.

18:00.537 --> 18:03.874
It has over 800 shops and services.

18:04.708 --> 18:06.168
Including this:

18:07.336 --> 18:08.754
Mindbender.

18:12.674 --> 18:14.093
Built in 1985...

18:15.344 --> 18:17.429
the Mindbender still holds the record

18:17.513 --> 18:21.433
as the world's tallest triple-loop
indoor roller coaster.

18:24.144 --> 18:26.438
The first drop is ten stories high.

18:29.525 --> 18:32.861
And it finishes
with riders hitting freeway speeds.

18:36.698 --> 18:39.576
I'm here to feel the Gs and measure them.

18:40.244 --> 18:41.370
It's gonna be fun.

18:41.453 --> 18:45.374
I wonder how Tory's doing.
I bet he's cold.

18:47.626 --> 18:49.545
[Tory] Forget the carnival rides.

18:49.628 --> 18:52.548
For my contender,
I want to experience firsthand

18:52.631 --> 18:55.843
the g-force thrill
of an Olympic-level extreme sport.

18:58.011 --> 19:00.055
I'm here at Utah Olympic Park.

19:00.556 --> 19:02.808
And behind me,
tucked into the Wasatch Mountains,

19:02.891 --> 19:06.687
is the bobsledding track that hosted
the 2002 Winter Olympics.

19:06.770 --> 19:09.022
And I get the privilege of going
for a ride

19:09.106 --> 19:11.024
with the current US bobsledding team

19:11.108 --> 19:13.735
to see how many g-forces I can experience.

19:19.366 --> 19:20.868
Rest assured,

19:20.951 --> 19:24.955
unlike Grant's contender,
this is not a ride for the fainthearted.

19:29.668 --> 19:32.254
The track is a terrifying prospect,

19:32.337 --> 19:34.131
4300 feet long

19:34.214 --> 19:36.508
with a 340-foot drop.

19:39.178 --> 19:42.306
Towards the end of the run,
we'll be at maximum velocity.

19:42.389 --> 19:44.099
And it's on turn number 12...

19:45.726 --> 19:48.645
where speed plus tight radius

19:48.729 --> 19:50.647
plus sharp change in direction

19:50.731 --> 19:52.274
equals peak g-force.

19:54.985 --> 19:56.862
It's too late to bail out now.

19:57.779 --> 20:01.158
Now, while Tory is preparing himself
on the bobsled track,

20:01.241 --> 20:04.328
I need to prepare myself
here at Galaxyland.

20:04.411 --> 20:05.996
And that preparation consists

20:06.079 --> 20:08.498
of setting up my g-force measuring vest.

20:08.582 --> 20:11.084
Yeah. Oh! [grunting]

20:11.168 --> 20:12.711
Ah! [laughing]

20:14.046 --> 20:15.839
Oh...

20:15.923 --> 20:18.717
Like any piece of precision
measuring equipment...

20:20.344 --> 20:21.970
it needs to be calibrated.

20:22.554 --> 20:24.973
Hello, fair people of Galaxyland.

20:25.724 --> 20:27.059
I've come to collect your data.

20:27.851 --> 20:31.438
And to do that, I need to subject it
to a number of different environments

20:31.521 --> 20:33.774
and collect as much data as I can.

20:34.733 --> 20:36.068
All of it.

20:36.151 --> 20:38.654
Once I feel that the data
that I'm getting is accurate,

20:38.737 --> 20:40.656
then and only then

20:40.739 --> 20:43.533
will I put it to the real test
on the Mindbender.

20:44.660 --> 20:46.536
So, now that I'm set up to record

20:46.620 --> 20:49.122
the peak G-force and duration
of those Gs...

20:49.206 --> 20:52.167
Oh! [screaming]

20:54.628 --> 20:59.174
I want some insider info on how
a rollercoaster uses those forces.

20:59.258 --> 21:00.133
Meet Walter.

21:00.217 --> 21:03.345
-I'm an amusement ride safety inspector.
-Okay. Cool.

21:03.428 --> 21:09.017
What types of Gs might we experience
on a standard rollercoaster?

21:09.101 --> 21:12.271
So, you have three basic g-force effects
on a roller coaster.

21:12.354 --> 21:13.939
You have the negative Gs,

21:14.022 --> 21:15.315
where you're lifted out of your seat.

21:15.399 --> 21:17.401
Say you're going over the top of a hill...

21:18.902 --> 21:21.488
You experience a negative force
when you're lifted up out of your seat.

21:21.571 --> 21:23.615
-Your stomach goes up. Yeah.
-Yeah, exactly.

21:23.699 --> 21:26.618
You have positive Gs you would
experience at the bottom of a valley.

21:28.287 --> 21:29.955
That's gonna pull you down into your seat.

21:30.038 --> 21:34.501
Make you feel like you're two or three
or four times as heavy as you really are.

21:34.584 --> 21:37.421
Your lateral Gs, as you're going around
a turn, say to the left...

21:39.047 --> 21:41.174
you're being pushed to the right.
You're going around a turn to the right...

21:42.759 --> 21:44.136
your body's being pushed to the left.

21:44.219 --> 21:45.262
Cool, all right.

21:45.345 --> 21:48.015
-Where am I gonna experience the most Gs?
-I would place my money

21:48.098 --> 21:49.725
on halfway up the third loop.

21:52.185 --> 21:53.186
Why the third loop?

21:53.270 --> 21:54.646
Because third loop is smaller

21:54.730 --> 21:56.064
and the approach to it

21:56.648 --> 21:58.358
is gonna give you more speed

21:58.442 --> 22:01.069
and quicker change of direction
in a smaller area.

22:02.279 --> 22:04.531
I've got a bet going with Tory that

22:04.614 --> 22:08.577
my roller coaster is gonna produce more Gs

22:08.660 --> 22:11.788
than his Olympic bobsled.
What do you think?

22:11.872 --> 22:13.081
From what I understand,

22:13.165 --> 22:16.835
this pulls some significant g-forces,
and it'll be a very fun experiment

22:16.918 --> 22:19.254
to play with your accelerometer
and find out.

22:20.422 --> 22:23.425
[Tory] I'm looking at the gate
and there's a sign that says:

22:23.508 --> 22:25.761
"Severe injury or death
beyond this point."

22:25.844 --> 22:27.220
Is that, like, an inside joke?

22:27.304 --> 22:28.972
-[laughs]
-Is that, like, serious?

22:29.056 --> 22:32.184
-Is that to fool people like me?
-It's a serious warning. Yeah.

22:32.267 --> 22:34.144
[chuckling] Dude, I can't wait.

22:34.227 --> 22:36.354
-We're good. We'll be fine. [laughs]
-Okay.

22:36.438 --> 22:38.148
Now, how fast are we gonna be going?

22:38.231 --> 22:39.816
Probably get about 80 miles an hour today.

22:40.442 --> 22:41.777
-[chuckles]
-Holy crap.

22:41.860 --> 22:43.737
-That's no joke.
-Yeah, it's fun.

22:45.655 --> 22:46.823
Wow.

22:46.907 --> 22:49.284
And with great speed comes great Gs.

22:49.367 --> 22:51.286
-Those guys are hauling.
-They're moving.

22:53.413 --> 22:57.084
[Tory] Like Grant, I'll be measuring
the g-force with an accelerometer.

22:59.336 --> 23:00.754
What's the duration of the Gs?

23:00.837 --> 23:04.132
Uh, I'd say most of them
are only about two seconds.

23:04.758 --> 23:07.010
What happens to your body
when you hit those Gs?

23:07.094 --> 23:09.930
A lot of [grunts] grunting,
a lot of compression.

23:10.013 --> 23:10.847
[both laugh]

23:11.848 --> 23:15.102
Go to the bathroom beforehand.
I don't know if anyone told you that.

23:15.185 --> 23:17.270
-[chuckling] No, they haven't.
-You need to.

23:19.397 --> 23:22.275
Wow, this thing is so sick.
I mean, it looks like a missile.

23:22.359 --> 23:23.485
It's pretty crazy.

23:23.568 --> 23:25.987
-So, you're going to be sitting up front.
-Yeah.

23:26.071 --> 23:26.988
Where am I gonna be?

23:27.072 --> 23:29.074
-You're sitting in the third spot.
-Okay.

23:29.157 --> 23:31.451
We thought about putting you
at the brakes, but...

23:31.535 --> 23:33.995
-Yeah, I wouldn't trust me either.
-Yeah. [chuckles]

23:35.872 --> 23:38.917
[Tory] It might look a breeze
when you see these guys do it...

23:42.254 --> 23:44.881
but it takes skill and training
to guide this missile.

23:45.632 --> 23:47.676
-I screwed that one up.
-[all laughing]

23:47.759 --> 23:50.095
Yeah, you got to get your feet in
faster than that.

23:51.179 --> 23:52.013
[exhales sharply]

23:52.097 --> 23:53.932
[Tory] Luckily I'm just hitching a ride,

23:54.015 --> 23:55.642
getting off easy on the training...

23:57.727 --> 23:58.562
and not driving.

23:59.521 --> 24:00.522
Eye of the tiger.

24:01.314 --> 24:03.441
In here we've got these rings

24:03.942 --> 24:06.778
and then you pull.
Right, go right, left, go left.

24:06.862 --> 24:08.864
And so, I just pull back on these puppies.

24:08.947 --> 24:09.781
Off the ground.

24:09.865 --> 24:10.866
Yup. There we go.

24:10.949 --> 24:12.159
Let's get another one.

24:13.618 --> 24:14.578
Boom.

24:14.661 --> 24:17.747
-So, it's small inputs.
-It's little inputs. Some places, like...

24:18.456 --> 24:21.501
corner 12 here,
you actually have to put pretty big input.

24:22.002 --> 24:22.836
Go.

24:22.919 --> 24:24.171
[Dakarai and Tory laugh]

24:26.339 --> 24:27.257
[Tory] Oh, my God.

24:27.340 --> 24:30.302
Otherwise the sled will just skyrocket
to the roof and...

24:30.385 --> 24:34.389
Yeah, I've seen that happen a few times.
That's not gonna happen. You'll be fine.

24:34.472 --> 24:36.308
-What the hell?
-[laughs] Yeah.

24:36.391 --> 24:38.268
So, this is kind of like, you know,

24:38.351 --> 24:41.354
like, when you're a kid
going down the hill on your little sled.

24:41.438 --> 24:42.647
-Yup.
-But on steroids.

24:42.731 --> 24:43.732
Yeah, essentially.

24:43.815 --> 24:45.400
-But not really on steroids.
-No.

24:45.483 --> 24:47.194
-Compete clean. [laughing]
-No steroids.

24:47.277 --> 24:49.279
No steroids involved in this run.

24:49.362 --> 24:52.282
I'm taking it that "steroids"
is a bad word around here.

24:52.365 --> 24:54.117
-Steroids is a hot topic these days.
-[laughing]

24:55.911 --> 24:58.455
-Uh, should we all take a pee test?
-Yeah. Right now?

24:58.538 --> 24:59.623
-Cups please.
-Cups.

25:00.207 --> 25:02.125
Would you say
there's a lot more going on,

25:02.209 --> 25:05.754
a lot more skill involved than jumping
on a rollercoaster, going for a ride?

25:05.837 --> 25:06.671
Oh, yeah.

25:08.381 --> 25:09.341
[in unison]
Grant.

25:09.424 --> 25:11.676
Tory right now is probably

25:11.760 --> 25:13.345
freezing his nuts off.

25:13.428 --> 25:16.598
I mean, like, literally freezing them off.

25:16.681 --> 25:18.892
They're probably
like little ball bearings.

25:20.018 --> 25:20.977
[Tory] This is it.

25:21.394 --> 25:23.563
Time to see who has the biggest...

25:23.647 --> 25:24.689
G-force.

25:26.483 --> 25:28.235
-[laughs]
-[woman] Is that okay?

25:29.694 --> 25:31.321
[Kari] Before the boys go head-to-head...

25:34.824 --> 25:36.368
I'm putting the pedal to the metal

25:36.451 --> 25:37.827
here at the Cathedral of Speed

25:37.911 --> 25:41.998
to check out the g-force physics
of some seriously fast cars.

25:48.588 --> 25:50.382
The Indianapolis Motor Speedway.

25:51.967 --> 25:53.176
One sick track.

25:53.677 --> 25:58.056
They're gonna let me get in a race car
just to see how many Gs I can pull.

26:19.619 --> 26:21.705
We've got two cars primed and ready to go.

26:21.788 --> 26:22.789
[whirring]

26:24.332 --> 26:27.669
And engineer Will is standing by
to capture all the data we'll need.

26:29.254 --> 26:31.047
We have gyros, accelerometers,

26:31.131 --> 26:32.507
lasers for ride heights.

26:32.591 --> 26:35.844
I'm fascinated. You can live-track
everything that's happening in the car.

26:35.927 --> 26:38.221
[William]
Yes, we see about 70 sensors live.

26:38.596 --> 26:41.057
We're gonna strap you into the backseat

26:41.141 --> 26:44.644
of our Indy car two-seater, but this thing
isn't as fast as my race car.

26:45.979 --> 26:48.815
We're gonna give you a taste
of some of the Gs, the numbers,

26:48.898 --> 26:51.276
then I'm gonna hop in my race car
and get real numbers.

26:53.069 --> 26:55.697
[Kari] I am excited and scared
all at the same time.

26:57.574 --> 27:03.496
An Indy car has a 2200 cc V6 engine
with a power output of 700 horsepower.

27:09.878 --> 27:11.004
[Kari] Oh, my God.

27:11.379 --> 27:12.380
Yup.

27:13.214 --> 27:14.090
It's fast.

27:16.468 --> 27:17.385
[whoops]

27:18.636 --> 27:22.349
Indianapolis' turn one at top speed
is the A spot...

27:23.016 --> 27:24.100
Yeah.

27:24.184 --> 27:25.435
for g-force.

27:27.062 --> 27:31.316
A long, tight turn where drivers
undergo peak Gs for several seconds.

27:31.483 --> 27:32.650
Oh, my God.

27:32.942 --> 27:34.110
Yeah.

27:36.905 --> 27:38.907
[whoops] Whoa.

27:39.282 --> 27:42.535
[William] In the turn one,
you hit about 2.9 lateral Gs.

27:43.495 --> 27:46.122
[Kari] And there was butterflies
in my stomach, and all of a sudden...

27:47.207 --> 27:49.417
we'd go around a turn, all the butterflies
shot up into my throat

27:49.501 --> 27:52.420
and I would [gasps] lose my breath
until we got to the straightaway.

27:55.465 --> 27:56.341
Faster!

27:56.883 --> 27:59.469
I mean,
I definitely feel like I got some good G.

28:00.929 --> 28:03.765
I think the butterflies in my stomach
are in my mouth.

28:04.557 --> 28:05.600
We did four hot laps...

28:06.518 --> 28:10.313
peaking at 2.9 Gs for four seconds.

28:10.980 --> 28:12.774
That was amazing.

28:12.857 --> 28:16.861
[James] There you go. Just do that
196 more times and that's the Indy 500.

28:17.487 --> 28:19.864
Oh, my God. [laughing]

28:22.909 --> 28:25.703
Let's see what James can do flying solo.

28:35.713 --> 28:36.881
While he gets up to speed...

28:39.759 --> 28:42.220
let's put my numbers
into 4-wheeled context.

28:44.097 --> 28:45.640
When it comes to horsepower,

28:45.724 --> 28:48.560
top fuel dragsters accelerate quicker

28:48.643 --> 28:50.895
than a jet fighter and a space shuttle.

28:53.565 --> 28:58.403
These beasts can hit
332 miles per hour in 4.5 seconds.

29:00.321 --> 29:03.283
Off the line,
they measure 2.5 on the Richter scale.

29:04.325 --> 29:06.411
They pull 6 Gs at the start line

29:06.494 --> 29:07.996
and when they pop the chute,

29:08.496 --> 29:10.206
they can pop their retinas.

29:10.707 --> 29:11.541
No, really.

29:12.041 --> 29:12.876
That happens.

29:15.170 --> 29:16.254
But duration is key.

29:16.337 --> 29:19.466
Dragsters only experience those peaks
for a split second.

29:20.884 --> 29:23.845
And that's where race car drivers
are king.

29:26.389 --> 29:28.641
Okay. So, James,
looks like you're going about...

29:29.768 --> 29:32.312
214 miles an hour, and damn,

29:32.854 --> 29:35.356
James, you got 3.6 Gs.

29:35.440 --> 29:36.399
That's crazy.

29:37.817 --> 29:40.862
James experiences more than
three times his body weight

29:40.945 --> 29:42.739
for four seconds

29:42.822 --> 29:44.032
and racers can even stray

29:44.115 --> 29:46.117
into G-LOC territory.

29:48.661 --> 29:52.290
In a 2001 practice session
at Texas Motor Speedway,

29:52.373 --> 29:54.959
drivers experienced almost 6 Gs

29:55.043 --> 29:58.546
for 18 of the 22 seconds
it took to complete a lap.

29:59.672 --> 30:01.049
Some came close to blackout

30:01.132 --> 30:03.051
and the race was canceled.

30:04.469 --> 30:08.014
But there's one thing
that creates more Gs than tight turns.

30:11.309 --> 30:14.646
Now, I know it's probably a little bit
of a sensitive subject,

30:14.729 --> 30:18.149
but the biggest change in acceleration
I could imagine out in the track

30:18.233 --> 30:21.611
would be if someone crashed
because you're stopping quickly.

30:21.694 --> 30:25.698
Yes. So, at Indy for sure you're going
about 230 miles per hour

30:26.282 --> 30:28.451
and if you hit the wall wrong,
you stop quickly.

30:29.661 --> 30:31.996
[Kari]
Sudden deceleration from high speeds

30:32.080 --> 30:33.581
equals enormous Gs.

30:35.458 --> 30:36.459
Off the scale.

30:39.045 --> 30:42.131
Like this crash by Kenny Brack in 2003.

30:44.926 --> 30:47.679
It logged 214 Gs
for a fraction of a second.

30:48.555 --> 30:50.223
It was a miracle he survived.

30:51.516 --> 30:53.893
However, we're looking at sustained Gs.

30:54.602 --> 30:57.897
And Indy car drivers take the prize
with over 5 Gs

30:58.523 --> 30:59.983
for four to five seconds.

31:00.733 --> 31:02.360
Would I do this again?

31:03.444 --> 31:04.571
Yeah!

31:04.654 --> 31:05.613
[whoops]

31:06.447 --> 31:09.909
[chuckling] Yes, I would so do this again.

31:13.079 --> 31:16.666
[Tory] Kari's race-car cornering
might pull some impressive Gs...

31:18.668 --> 31:21.629
but for my next contender,
the sky's the limit.

31:24.382 --> 31:26.801
Yup, I'm thinking jet pilots
could take the top spot

31:27.385 --> 31:28.887
of most g-force exposure.

31:30.555 --> 31:33.766
In fact, it was during
the aerial dogfights of World War I...

31:35.560 --> 31:37.812
that g-forces were first identified.

31:39.898 --> 31:41.983
In the heat of the battle,
pilots were pulling

31:42.066 --> 31:43.818
more and more extreme maneuvers

31:43.902 --> 31:46.487
and passing out,
or fainting in air as it was known.

31:48.573 --> 31:52.744
Sudden changes in directions,
extended tight turns and extreme climbs

31:52.827 --> 31:55.914
pulls the blood from the head
to the lower extremities,

31:55.997 --> 31:58.124
causing you to pass out or G-LOC.

31:59.417 --> 32:02.086
G-force-induced loss of consciousness.

32:03.379 --> 32:05.089
It happened to me once, and it sucks.

32:05.673 --> 32:07.800
It's understandable that people think

32:07.884 --> 32:10.053
the biggest acceleration
someone can experience

32:10.136 --> 32:12.180
is during liftoff of a space mission.

32:12.263 --> 32:14.682
But rockets are designed
to keep the acceleration low

32:14.766 --> 32:18.561
to limit the Gs sustained so astronauts
can remain awake and alert.

32:18.645 --> 32:19.604
So...

32:20.355 --> 32:23.650
It's not the size of the engines,
or straight-line thrust that matters.

32:23.733 --> 32:24.776
It's the moves.

32:26.694 --> 32:29.447
That means fighter pilots
and aerobatic performers

32:29.530 --> 32:31.866
experience
the greatest sustained g-forces.

32:33.451 --> 32:35.495
They can't afford to lose consciousness

32:35.578 --> 32:38.081
at the controls
of a multi-million-dollar aircraft.

32:38.206 --> 32:41.292
So, they train in a simulator
to practice breathing, tense muscles,

32:41.376 --> 32:43.378
and help maintain blood and oxygen flow.

32:43.461 --> 32:46.172
Three, four! [whoops]

32:47.966 --> 32:50.385
[Tory] They also wear g-suits
and special flight suits

32:50.468 --> 32:54.347
that compress their legs to squeeze
the blood from the lower extremities

32:54.430 --> 32:57.225
towards their head to prevent blackout.
So...

32:57.308 --> 32:58.434
The real question is,

32:58.518 --> 33:00.853
who's gonna be the top gun
for the g-forces?

33:02.689 --> 33:04.440
Well, these guys, the Red Bull pilots,

33:04.524 --> 33:06.025
rack up some insane numbers.

33:09.988 --> 33:11.739
They regularly hit 10 Gs

33:11.823 --> 33:13.992
pulling off some incredible maneuvers.

33:17.912 --> 33:19.205
And they're able to do this

33:19.288 --> 33:21.499
because they wear
those special pressure suits

33:21.582 --> 33:23.292
to help maintain consciousness.

33:25.878 --> 33:27.296
So, I'm going with these guys.

33:28.339 --> 33:29.424
The Blue Angels.

33:33.928 --> 33:36.014
These guys also pull up to 10 Gs

33:36.097 --> 33:38.933
and sometimes they maintain them
for three seconds.

33:39.308 --> 33:41.019
That is full G-LOC territory.

33:44.522 --> 33:46.190
But unlike the Red Bull pilots,

33:46.274 --> 33:49.402
because of cockpit restrictions,
they can't wear a G-suit.

33:49.986 --> 33:51.779
Their bodies have to be trained

33:51.863 --> 33:53.740
to take 100% of the Gs.

33:55.158 --> 33:56.743
And that makes them my choice

33:56.826 --> 33:58.870
for aerial g-force junkies.

33:59.787 --> 34:01.039
Let's go over the criteria.

34:01.122 --> 34:03.541
Number one, they pulled 10 Gs.

34:03.624 --> 34:05.585
Number two, what's the duration?

34:05.668 --> 34:08.629
They hold those Gs for over three seconds.

34:08.713 --> 34:12.050
Number three, the extreme factor?
Did you see the video?

34:19.474 --> 34:22.143
[Grant] In pursuit of the Holy Grail
of medieval Gs...

34:24.062 --> 34:25.605
I've built a rig,

34:25.688 --> 34:27.148
simulated a joust...

34:29.067 --> 34:30.860
and I'm confident that my accelerometers

34:30.943 --> 34:32.653
will stand up to the heat of battle.

34:39.035 --> 34:40.745
Time to give modern science

34:40.828 --> 34:42.371
a ride in the Middle Ages.

34:42.955 --> 34:44.165
[Charlie] Try to look tough.

34:45.041 --> 34:46.501
-[Grant] Hey, Charlie.
-Hey, Grant.

34:47.085 --> 34:49.504
I'm back and I'm armed with one of these.

34:49.587 --> 34:51.380
This accelerometer is gonna tell us

34:51.464 --> 34:54.258
how many Gs your target knight experiences
when you hit him.

34:54.342 --> 34:56.302
All you have to do is hit him real hard.

34:56.886 --> 34:58.888
-I can hit him real hard.
-Excellent.

34:59.472 --> 35:01.349
His grandchildren will have headaches.

35:02.183 --> 35:03.017
[neighs]

35:03.101 --> 35:05.061
Ready to joust in the name of science?

35:05.144 --> 35:08.272
Absolutely.
We're gonna put physics to the test.

35:08.356 --> 35:11.359
Mass plus acceleration equals ouch.

35:12.568 --> 35:15.029
Ride fast and hit hard.
I'll meet you in the middle.

35:15.113 --> 35:16.697
-[Grant] All right.
-[Charlie] Let's go to war.

35:18.366 --> 35:19.700
[Grant] War. Huh.

35:20.284 --> 35:21.744
What is it good for?

35:21.828 --> 35:24.372
Medieval g-force data collection,
actually.

35:24.455 --> 35:26.582
But apart from that, absolutely nothing.

35:26.707 --> 35:29.210
My knights, joust bravely...

35:30.378 --> 35:31.587
joust fiercely...

35:32.171 --> 35:33.005
but most importantly...

35:35.383 --> 35:37.385
joust consistently.

35:41.639 --> 35:42.682
Ready?

35:43.975 --> 35:45.059
Ready?

35:45.810 --> 35:46.644
Go!

35:46.727 --> 35:47.603
[shouts indistinctly]

35:47.687 --> 35:48.980
[shouts indistinctly]

35:53.860 --> 35:55.486
-[Grant chuckling]
-[horse neighing]

36:00.199 --> 36:02.702
Okay. I'm probably gonna need
some more data sets,

36:02.785 --> 36:05.079
so we're gonna have to keep jousting,
okay?

36:05.663 --> 36:07.081
[neighs]

36:07.165 --> 36:08.040
Charge!

36:13.880 --> 36:15.965
-[groans]
-Yes!

36:18.759 --> 36:19.969
Give me more.

36:20.553 --> 36:21.888
Are you not amused?

36:24.182 --> 36:27.977
We're gonna keep going until I'm satisfied
we've reached peak Gs...

36:30.771 --> 36:32.440
or we break all the knights.

36:39.780 --> 36:41.741
[Charlie laughs]

36:42.158 --> 36:43.075
[men] Oh!

36:44.243 --> 36:45.703
Can somebody check him?

36:47.663 --> 36:48.664
[grunting]

36:54.086 --> 36:54.962
Yes!

36:55.546 --> 36:56.881
Just a splinter, right?

36:56.964 --> 36:58.382
[knights shouting indistinctly]

37:17.401 --> 37:19.445
[Charlie] God damn! That one hit hard.

37:19.528 --> 37:20.863
Now, that's data.

37:20.947 --> 37:22.240
Medieval style.

37:25.368 --> 37:27.870
-[Charlie whoops]
-Charlie, that was fantastic.

37:27.954 --> 37:30.831
-That is the original drive-by.
-[laughs]

37:31.707 --> 37:32.708
I've always wondered...

37:32.792 --> 37:36.212
I mean, I've made 10,000s of these passes

37:36.295 --> 37:37.755
and had these hits and come off

37:37.838 --> 37:40.341
and I've always wondered,
how violent is this?

37:43.886 --> 37:46.264
The highest run out of the whole day

37:46.347 --> 37:48.724
was the one where you didn't fall
off the horse,

37:49.308 --> 37:51.269
and your target knight fell off.

37:51.978 --> 37:54.188
That was 3.22 Gs.

37:54.272 --> 37:57.566
He experienced over three times
his body weight in acceleration

37:59.277 --> 38:02.822
as a result of being hit in the chest
with your lance.

38:02.989 --> 38:04.740
So, that's a massive hit.

38:04.824 --> 38:06.117
-[chuckles]
-That's a lot.

38:06.200 --> 38:09.912
That is a head-on collision
with two Volkswagens and no seatbelt.

38:12.331 --> 38:15.710
It's brutal and we have the numbers now
to back it up.

38:16.294 --> 38:19.672
So, I set out to do something
that had never been done before.

38:19.755 --> 38:24.343
To find the number of Gs
someone experiences while jousting.

38:27.221 --> 38:30.099
What you experience is 3.22 Gs.

38:30.891 --> 38:34.645
That's almost three-and-a-quarter times
your body weight. It's not insignificant.

38:34.729 --> 38:35.688
The duration?

38:38.941 --> 38:39.984
Not that long.

38:40.067 --> 38:43.070
But here is where I think
jousting is gonna win.

38:44.196 --> 38:45.364
Extreme factor.

38:45.614 --> 38:49.368
Keep in mind that this is an activity
that dates back to medieval times.

38:49.952 --> 38:52.038
It has its roots in combat

38:52.121 --> 38:53.664
at a time when safety

38:53.748 --> 38:55.374
wasn't the highest concern.

38:56.709 --> 38:57.960
[grunts]

38:58.044 --> 39:00.212
It is scary as hell

39:00.296 --> 39:02.590
and that's why I think it's gonna win.

39:03.174 --> 39:06.177
-Charlie, thanks for your help.
-Thank you. It's been an honor.

39:06.260 --> 39:09.555
And may g-force be with you.

39:09.638 --> 39:11.223
[imitating Luke Skywalker]
Thank you, Father.

39:11.932 --> 39:12.933
[imitating Darth Vader]
I am your father.

39:13.017 --> 39:14.935
I know. [chuckles]

39:15.019 --> 39:16.687
May the horse be with you?

39:16.771 --> 39:18.522
-Oh!
-[neighs]

39:18.606 --> 39:19.440
Nice one.

39:20.024 --> 39:23.986
All right, Grant. So, you maxed out
at 3.22 Gs with the jousters?

39:24.070 --> 39:26.447
That's good,
but it's nowhere close to the fliers.

39:26.947 --> 39:30.242
Oh, come on. Stapp kicks the living crap
out of both your numbers.

39:30.326 --> 39:34.121
Look, 3.22 Gs is nothing to laugh at.
Based on the size of the impact,

39:34.205 --> 39:35.664
I thought it would have been higher.

39:36.332 --> 39:37.291
So, what's next?

39:37.375 --> 39:39.335
Now, Grant and I
are gonna go head-to-head

39:39.418 --> 39:42.880
in a competition between roller coaster
versus Olympic bobsledder

39:42.963 --> 39:44.465
to see who has the most Gs.

39:44.548 --> 39:46.801
Oh, it's on. It's on like "Donkey Kong."

39:47.385 --> 39:48.886
You're going on a roller coaster.

39:48.969 --> 39:50.137
[chuckles] I know. It's awesome.

39:55.309 --> 39:56.560
[Grant] Ladies and gentlemen,

39:56.644 --> 40:00.189
please keep your hands and arms
inside the ride at all times.

40:01.982 --> 40:03.109
[laughs]

40:03.692 --> 40:04.735
Do not stand up.

40:06.278 --> 40:07.613
And enjoy your day...

40:11.283 --> 40:12.868
This is for science.

40:12.952 --> 40:14.286
here on the Mindbender.

40:19.834 --> 40:20.793
Okay. Let's do this.

40:21.377 --> 40:23.337
Okay, here we go. We're going.

40:23.421 --> 40:24.296
Okay, great.

40:34.515 --> 40:36.976
Look at this thing.
Look how far up I'm going.

40:37.560 --> 40:40.104
Dude, there's no way a bobsled
is gonna beat this.

40:40.855 --> 40:41.856
You kidding me?

40:43.566 --> 40:44.567
All right, here we go.

40:46.444 --> 40:47.736
Okay, here we go.

40:49.738 --> 40:51.991
Oh, sh-- [screaming]

40:54.410 --> 40:55.786
Holy crap, holy crap.

40:56.537 --> 40:57.955
[screaming]

41:01.917 --> 41:03.419
Oh, my God. [grunting]

41:05.254 --> 41:06.505
[Grant] Oh. Oh!

41:07.214 --> 41:08.174
[yells]

41:11.427 --> 41:12.428
[grunting]

41:13.179 --> 41:14.013
Oh, my God.

41:15.139 --> 41:16.932
Here we go into the third loop.

41:17.433 --> 41:18.726
Oh! [grunting]

41:20.978 --> 41:21.979
Yeah.

41:22.062 --> 41:23.647
That was a lot of Gs. [grunting]

41:24.690 --> 41:25.524
-[screams]
-[grunts]

41:25.608 --> 41:27.193
-Aah.
-[grunts]

41:27.276 --> 41:29.612
[Tory] Aah. This is not fun!

41:31.071 --> 41:33.157
There's no way
a bobsled's gonna beat this.

41:33.866 --> 41:35.534
[Tory] Oh, those are some Gs.

41:36.577 --> 41:39.788
-[grunts]
-[Grant] There goes some positive Gs

41:39.872 --> 41:42.166
right in the butt.
[grunts, then screaming]

41:45.085 --> 41:46.295
[grunting]

41:46.378 --> 41:47.671
[Tory] How do you guys do this?

41:51.008 --> 41:52.134
Oh...

41:53.260 --> 41:55.179
Oh, God, thank God, it's over.

41:57.181 --> 41:59.934
No chance in hell his bobsled
is gonna beat me.

42:03.562 --> 42:04.730
That was insane.

42:05.314 --> 42:06.565
Dude, that was nuts.

42:06.649 --> 42:10.402
You didn't hear that screaming, did you?
You're gonna edit that out, right?

42:10.486 --> 42:11.695
[screams]

42:11.779 --> 42:13.739
We're just like... [grunting]

42:15.991 --> 42:16.867
[grunting]

42:16.951 --> 42:20.663
I have to say, it wasn't enjoyable
like a rollercoaster ride.

42:22.081 --> 42:23.290
I'm pretty sure you're right.

42:23.374 --> 42:25.709
That third loop
is the one that had the most Gs.

42:25.793 --> 42:26.794
Oh! [grunting]

42:29.255 --> 42:30.130
Oh, my God.

42:30.214 --> 42:32.550
Are you guys regretting
letting me join your team?

42:32.633 --> 42:33.467
[all laugh]

42:35.719 --> 42:38.097
What's crazy
is that this is so much more intense

42:38.180 --> 42:39.848
than I could have ever imagined.

42:42.893 --> 42:44.520
-You take a lot of abuse.
-Yeah.

42:45.020 --> 42:47.773
[Tory] I felt like I was in a barrel
that got rolled down a hill.

42:47.856 --> 42:49.149
[all laughing]

42:50.651 --> 42:52.027
Thank you, guys. I am honored.

42:52.111 --> 42:53.153
Thank you so much.

42:53.737 --> 42:56.907
-I'm just glad... I didn't cause a crash.
-Happy to have you.

42:56.991 --> 42:58.325
[all laugh]

42:58.409 --> 43:00.661
-Well, let's go look at the data.
-All right.

43:01.245 --> 43:03.122
[grunting] A little help.

43:04.331 --> 43:05.374
That was rad.

43:05.457 --> 43:06.542
-Do you have the data?
-[Tory] Yes.

43:07.209 --> 43:09.003
This is the data for the bobsled.

43:09.086 --> 43:12.172
I'm hitting a peak speed
of 82 miles an hour.

43:12.256 --> 43:13.966
Now, it's really those tight corners

43:14.049 --> 43:16.635
that you hit going fast
that build up those Gs.

43:16.719 --> 43:18.887
So, what I'm really curious to see
is turn 12

43:18.971 --> 43:21.265
because that one,
you really feel it in your body.

43:21.348 --> 43:22.933
All right, so, that one...

43:23.017 --> 43:24.977
Wow, 5.6 Gs.

43:25.060 --> 43:27.563
Let's see how the roller coaster
stacks up.

43:27.646 --> 43:28.480
Okay. My turn.

43:28.564 --> 43:31.567
The one I really want
to show you is turn three.

43:31.650 --> 43:33.068
At the bottom of this turn,

43:33.152 --> 43:37.239
I get the benefit of having
more or less my peak speed

43:37.406 --> 43:40.159
but also, like you, a decreasing radius.

43:40.242 --> 43:42.369
Those two together give me my peak...

43:42.453 --> 43:46.957
-which is 5.75 Gs. Boom.
-[Tory] Wow.

43:47.541 --> 43:49.501
That's interesting
because you're going 55.

43:49.585 --> 43:51.837
And I was going 85 getting less Gs.

43:51.920 --> 43:54.256
When we take all the results
from all the criteria,

43:54.340 --> 43:56.550
average them out,
we get the final list and...

43:57.134 --> 43:59.261
We've gone from two guys on horseback

43:59.720 --> 44:03.223
to fighter jets that routinely break
the sound barrier.

44:03.807 --> 44:07.102
Let's see how our contenders rate
using the three criteria.

44:07.603 --> 44:08.896
Number of Gs.

44:09.438 --> 44:10.773
Duration of Gs.

44:11.523 --> 44:13.275
And extreme factor.

44:16.570 --> 44:18.989
At number six, jousting.

44:20.949 --> 44:24.370
With only two horsepower,
it has the shortest duration of Gs.

44:25.412 --> 44:29.291
But with all that carnage and chaos,
it ranks at number two in extreme factor.

44:30.209 --> 44:32.461
Coming it at number five, bobsled.

44:33.462 --> 44:35.214
When Tory rattled into turn 12...

44:35.297 --> 44:36.465
Holy crap, holy crap.

44:37.091 --> 44:39.218
he measured 5.6 Gs,

44:39.468 --> 44:42.137
which crushed him
for a 1.5 second duration.

44:42.221 --> 44:43.055
[Tory grunting]

44:43.138 --> 44:45.182
But his Olympic glory was short-lived...

44:45.265 --> 44:46.100
[Grant screaming]

44:48.435 --> 44:50.979
by losing to Grant's roller coaster
at number four.

44:51.063 --> 44:53.315
The carnival ride actually pinned him
to his seat

44:53.399 --> 44:56.318
-for a buttock-squashing 5.75 Gs.
-Oh...

44:57.820 --> 45:01.156
And had him white-knuckling
for a duration of 1.9 seconds.

45:02.491 --> 45:04.201
In third position, race car.

45:04.284 --> 45:05.119
[Kari] Oh, my God.

45:05.536 --> 45:06.578
[whoops]

45:06.662 --> 45:09.832
The number of g-force experienced
on turn one at Indianapolis

45:09.915 --> 45:13.293
was just below the bobsled,
but is number one for duration,

45:13.377 --> 45:16.547
experiencing those Gs
for a full five seconds.

45:18.215 --> 45:20.551
Flying in at number two,
The Blue Angels.

45:22.136 --> 45:24.763
Pulling 10 Gs for up to three seconds,

45:25.139 --> 45:27.766
the extreme factor is so high,
you can lose consciousness

45:27.850 --> 45:29.143
and your breakfast.

45:30.602 --> 45:31.770
And at number one...

45:33.480 --> 45:35.399
the man who sacrificed his body

45:35.482 --> 45:38.360
to make life safer
for every g-force junkie to come,

45:38.444 --> 45:40.320
Colonel John Paul Stapp.

45:40.404 --> 45:46.076
His 44-year-old body endured
an eyeballs-out 25 Gs on the Sonic Wind.

45:46.160 --> 45:48.537
And you can't get much more
of an extreme factor

45:48.620 --> 45:50.664
than strapping yourself to a rocket sled.

45:52.040 --> 45:54.084
Ah, those were the good old days.

45:55.085 --> 45:57.588
[Kari] He's the ultimate G-Force Jedi.

45:59.256 --> 46:01.008
I mean, I could see that one coming.

46:01.592 --> 46:02.509
Stapp.

46:02.593 --> 46:05.262
I mean, it makes sense.
He's the godfather of Gs.

46:05.846 --> 46:07.306
So, would you say he's the OG?

46:07.389 --> 46:08.307
[chuckling]
