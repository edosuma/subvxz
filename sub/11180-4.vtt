WEBVTT

00:01.449 --> 00:04.176
Well, we're movin' on up
Movin' on up

00:04.314 --> 00:07.145
To the East Side
Movin' on up

00:07.283 --> 00:11.666
To a deluxe apartment
in the sky

00:11.804 --> 00:14.773
Movin' on up
Movin' on up

00:14.911 --> 00:16.430
To the East Side

00:16.568 --> 00:17.810
Movin' on up

00:17.948 --> 00:21.849
We finally got
a piece of the pie

00:23.368 --> 00:26.129
Fish don't fry
in the kitchen

00:26.267 --> 00:28.545
Beans don't burn
on the grill

00:28.683 --> 00:31.134
Took a whole lot of tryin'

00:31.272 --> 00:34.034
Just to get up that hill

00:34.172 --> 00:36.553
Now we're up
in the big leagues

00:36.691 --> 00:39.108
Gettin' our turn at bat

00:39.246 --> 00:41.489
As long as we live
It's you and me, baby

00:41.627 --> 00:43.767
There ain't nothin'
wrong with that

00:43.905 --> 00:46.115
Well, we're movin' on up
Movin' on up

00:46.253 --> 00:49.152
To the East Side
Movin' on up

00:49.290 --> 00:53.743
To a deluxe apartment
in the sky

00:53.881 --> 00:56.504
Movin' on up
Movin' on up

00:56.642 --> 00:59.611
To the East Side
Movin' on up

00:59.749 --> 01:05.272
We finally got
a piece of the pie

01:08.689 --> 01:10.208
Morning

01:10.346 --> 01:12.900
Like the day
is dawning...

01:13.556 --> 01:14.557
GEORGE: Hey, hey, hey!

01:14.695 --> 01:17.387
How's my foxy tomato
this morning?

01:18.630 --> 01:20.010
Well, if you squeeze
any harder,

01:20.149 --> 01:22.323
your tomato's gonna
turn into ketchup.

01:23.842 --> 01:25.050
Where's Lionel?

01:25.188 --> 01:27.121
We can't have him
being late his first
day at work.

01:27.259 --> 01:28.605
He's getting dressed.

01:28.743 --> 01:30.090
George, I've been wondering.

01:30.228 --> 01:31.988
Do you think
he'll be able
to handle it?

01:32.126 --> 01:34.439
Sure he can. He's been
getting dressed for years.

01:37.027 --> 01:39.237
I mean, studying
for his master's degree

01:39.375 --> 01:40.997
and working at the same time.

01:41.135 --> 01:43.482
Don't worry about Lionel.
He can handle anything.

01:43.620 --> 01:44.656
He's my son.

01:44.794 --> 01:46.002
And mine!

01:46.140 --> 01:48.004
Yeah, but he overcame
that part.

01:50.110 --> 01:51.663
What are you fixing
for his breakfast?

01:51.801 --> 01:53.768
His favorite dish.

01:53.906 --> 01:55.011
Food.

01:56.012 --> 01:57.600
Look what I got
for him.

01:58.808 --> 02:00.396
His own desk plate.

02:00.534 --> 02:02.915
"Lionel Jefferson, engineer."

02:03.053 --> 02:05.504
Oh, that's nice, George.

02:05.642 --> 02:07.472
But isn't it ostentatious?

02:07.610 --> 02:09.336
No, it's real brass.

02:14.306 --> 02:16.619
What made you think
about getting him this?

02:16.757 --> 02:18.138
Well, I got it
for two reasons.

02:18.276 --> 02:20.347
One, he's the first Jefferson
ever to become an engineer,

02:20.485 --> 02:22.556
and two, with a sign
like this on his desk,

02:22.694 --> 02:25.593
them honkies will know
he wasn't hired
to shine shoes.

02:28.527 --> 02:30.011
Morning, Mom.
Morning, Pop.

02:30.150 --> 02:31.116
Good morning, Lionel.

02:31.254 --> 02:32.600
Morning, my son.

02:40.608 --> 02:42.023
What?

02:42.162 --> 02:44.198
Don't you notice
anything different
about the table?

02:47.167 --> 02:48.168
No.

02:49.065 --> 02:50.756
The sign, the sign!

02:50.894 --> 02:52.931
Oh, the sign!

02:53.069 --> 02:56.417
Hey, I don't need that, Pop.
I already know where
to sit for breakfast.

02:59.282 --> 03:01.664
Hey, man, I was just
putting you on!

03:01.802 --> 03:04.563
Hey, Pop, you know,
I really appreciate this.

03:04.701 --> 03:07.980
It's terrific.
And I'm gonna use it too.

03:08.118 --> 03:10.673
Are you excited about
starting work today?

03:10.811 --> 03:12.813
Why should I be?
It's just a job.

03:12.951 --> 03:14.435
But aren't you nervous?

03:14.573 --> 03:16.403
What kind of work
will you be doing?

03:16.541 --> 03:19.716
At $18,000 a year,
he'll do whatever
they tell him.

03:21.891 --> 03:24.652
Well, um, I'll be working
with digital circuitry,

03:24.790 --> 03:27.276
integrated bypass systems,
analytical frequencies

03:27.414 --> 03:29.347
and remote resistance factors.

03:29.485 --> 03:31.072
They ain't paying you enough.

03:32.695 --> 03:33.765
Sure they are!

03:33.903 --> 03:36.492
Teletex Electronics
is a great company.

03:36.630 --> 03:38.666
He's lucky to get a job there.

03:38.804 --> 03:41.221
When I was his age,
I was lucky to find
a job anyplace.

03:41.359 --> 03:43.499
I even worked in a
smelly old fish market.

03:43.637 --> 03:44.983
I hated that.

03:45.121 --> 03:46.260
They really worked
you hard, huh, Pop?

03:46.398 --> 03:48.193
The hardest part
was after work.

03:48.331 --> 03:52.232
I had to run all the way home
to keep the alley cats
from eating my pants.

03:55.821 --> 03:57.098
Well, I gotta go now.

03:57.237 --> 03:59.066
But you haven't
eaten anything!

03:59.204 --> 04:00.999
Are you sure
you'll be all right?

04:01.137 --> 04:02.863
Hey,
I'll be fine, Mom.

04:03.001 --> 04:04.761
You just take it easy.

04:04.899 --> 04:06.591
You want me
to call you a cab?
You don't wanna be late.

04:06.729 --> 04:07.695
Bosses hate that.

04:07.833 --> 04:09.490
I know because
I'm a boss.

04:10.629 --> 04:12.907
Hey, Pop,
I got plenty
of time.

04:13.045 --> 04:16.359
Now, you be sure
and have a nice,
hot lunch.

04:16.497 --> 04:18.188
Uh-huh.
And, um, if it rains,

04:18.327 --> 04:19.742
I'll be sure
to wear my rubbers

04:19.880 --> 04:21.571
and I'll pin a little
nametag on my chest

04:21.709 --> 04:23.504
just in case I get lost.

04:23.642 --> 04:25.092
Oh, Lionel,
I didn't mean it...

04:25.230 --> 04:26.921
Hey, Mom, now, look.

04:27.059 --> 04:28.889
I'm just a dude
going off to work.

04:29.027 --> 04:30.477
No big thing.

04:32.962 --> 04:33.997
Oh!

04:34.135 --> 04:36.034
Oh!

04:36.172 --> 04:37.242
Hi, Jenny.

04:37.380 --> 04:41.211
Oh! Oh, Lionel,
I'm so happy for you!

04:45.388 --> 04:47.148
Oh. Well,
what was that for?

04:47.287 --> 04:49.219
For your first day
at work.

04:49.358 --> 04:51.049
Oh!

04:51.187 --> 04:53.638
Well, wives are supposed
to kiss their husbands
goodbye at their door,

04:53.776 --> 04:55.122
but since we're
not married yet,

04:55.260 --> 04:57.089
I had to come downstairs
to your door.

04:57.227 --> 04:59.160
Well, uh, thanks, Jenny,

04:59.299 --> 05:01.093
but, you know, you really
didn't have to get up so early

05:01.231 --> 05:03.164
just for a little
thing like that.

05:03.993 --> 05:06.236
Well, see you
all later!

05:09.516 --> 05:11.863
Is he feeling
all right? I mean,
he's so calm.

05:12.001 --> 05:13.451
He takes after me.

05:13.589 --> 05:16.316
We don't believe
in getting emotional
over things.

05:17.938 --> 05:19.836
All right, I got me a job!

05:19.974 --> 05:21.493
A job, yeah!

05:30.916 --> 05:32.539
Isn't he wonderful?

05:32.677 --> 05:33.954
Yeah.

05:34.092 --> 05:36.543
Well, nice seeing
you again, Jenny. Bye.

05:37.889 --> 05:39.166
George!

05:40.029 --> 05:41.755
There's just one thing,
Mr. Jefferson.

05:41.893 --> 05:44.413
My father would like
to invite the three of
you to dinner tonight.

05:44.551 --> 05:46.518
Oh, that's nice!
That's out.

05:46.656 --> 05:48.071
Why?

05:48.209 --> 05:50.350
Because I've got
a photographer coming
over to take our picture.

05:50.488 --> 05:51.730
Oh, what sort
of picture?

05:51.868 --> 05:53.076
A family portrait.

05:53.214 --> 05:56.252
We haven't had one taken
since Lionel was 12.

05:56.390 --> 05:57.771
Oh, yeah!
I remember that one.

05:57.909 --> 05:59.462
Lionel kept getting
too close to the camera.

05:59.600 --> 06:02.362
His head looked like
a great big old watermelon.

06:02.500 --> 06:04.881
That's because
you squeezed
all three of us

06:05.019 --> 06:07.919
into that little photo
booth on Coney Island.

06:09.507 --> 06:11.094
So now we got us
a real photographer,

06:11.232 --> 06:12.682
we can't go to dinner.

06:12.820 --> 06:14.995
But, George,
the photographer
will be here at 6:00.

06:15.133 --> 06:16.272
We could go after that.

06:16.410 --> 06:17.791
Will you just mind
your business?

06:17.929 --> 06:20.552
Tell your father
we'd love to go, Jenny.

06:20.690 --> 06:22.520
All right!
Thank you so much.

06:22.658 --> 06:24.038
You don't know
what this means to me.

06:24.176 --> 06:26.593
You don't know
what this means to me.

06:26.731 --> 06:28.249
But you shouldn't
be thanking us!

06:28.388 --> 06:30.113
We should be
thanking you!

06:30.251 --> 06:33.047
No, Mrs. Jefferson,
believe me, I should
be thanking you.

06:33.185 --> 06:34.635
Mom is away
visiting her parents,

06:34.773 --> 06:36.637
and after three days
of my cooking,

06:36.775 --> 06:38.881
I deserve something
decent to eat.

06:39.985 --> 06:41.573
Bye!
Bye!

06:48.408 --> 06:49.650
Yes?

06:49.788 --> 06:51.238
Good! Send him in.

06:54.552 --> 06:56.657
Hello... Lionel!

06:58.107 --> 07:00.212
How are you?
I'm Bill Hoffman,
Director of Personnel.

07:00.350 --> 07:01.731
Nice to meet you, sir.

07:01.869 --> 07:02.974
Oh, you don't have
to call me "sir."

07:03.112 --> 07:04.458
Oh, fine!

07:04.596 --> 07:06.667
"Your majesty" will do.

07:08.289 --> 07:09.463
"Your majesty?"

07:09.601 --> 07:11.879
It's just one
of my little jokes.

07:12.017 --> 07:14.813
I like to put people
at their ease
with a little joke.

07:14.951 --> 07:17.367
I expect you're a bundle
of nerves right now, huh?

07:17.506 --> 07:20.198
No, not really.
Yes, I thought so.

07:20.336 --> 07:21.510
Nothing to be ashamed about.

07:21.648 --> 07:23.373
Almost everybody is
when they first come in.

07:23.512 --> 07:25.686
Then I tell my little joke
to put them at their ease.

07:25.824 --> 07:27.170
Ah, that's a good idea!
Thank you!

07:27.308 --> 07:29.449
Why don't you sit down.
Thanks.

07:29.587 --> 07:31.485
Yes, here at
Teletex Electronics

07:31.623 --> 07:34.557
we try to avoid the stiff,
impersonal image

07:34.695 --> 07:36.628
so many businesses have.
Great!

07:36.766 --> 07:39.873
We feel we've created
a relaxed working
atmosphere here.

07:40.011 --> 07:41.495
No stress,
no pressure.

07:41.633 --> 07:43.635
Would you like a Tums?
No, thank you.

07:46.880 --> 07:49.848
I've been going
over your record.

07:49.986 --> 07:52.333
I want to tell you,
I'm quite impressed.

07:52.472 --> 07:53.611
That's nice to know.

07:53.749 --> 07:56.924
And it's important
to give a good impression.

07:57.062 --> 07:59.548
Rich Little
would do well here.

08:03.621 --> 08:05.554
Impression. Rich Little.

08:08.660 --> 08:11.836
This is a package
we give all our
new employees.

08:11.974 --> 08:13.631
We really take care
of you here, you know.

08:13.769 --> 08:16.323
It has all the
information about such
things as credit union,

08:16.461 --> 08:18.325
pension fund,
group health insurance.

08:18.463 --> 08:20.085
It covers you
and your family.

08:20.223 --> 08:21.224
Are you married,
by the way?

08:21.362 --> 08:22.329
No, I'm single.

08:22.467 --> 08:24.745
Any children?
What?

08:24.883 --> 08:28.059
Oh, I get it! That's one
of your little jokes, huh?

08:32.408 --> 08:35.204
No, that's one
of the little questions
I have to ask you.

08:36.930 --> 08:38.172
No children.
Good.

08:41.451 --> 08:44.524
Yes? Fine. He can
come in now.

08:44.662 --> 08:46.077
Our Mr. Tulley
is going to go over

08:46.215 --> 08:48.148
the personal history
form you filled out.

08:48.286 --> 08:49.736
Why, did I leave
something out?

08:49.874 --> 08:51.669
No, no, no,
don't be nervous.
It's standard procedure.

08:51.807 --> 08:54.257
Just the final part
of your processing.

08:54.395 --> 08:55.465
Morning!

08:55.604 --> 08:56.984
Ah, Tulley.
This is Lionel Jefferson.

08:57.122 --> 08:58.296
He's gonna be working
on the third floor.

08:58.434 --> 08:59.815
Lionel,
Roger Tulley.

08:59.953 --> 09:02.265
Hi.
Good morning,
Mr. Jefferson.

09:02.403 --> 09:03.991
Well, I have got
a meeting to go to, Lionel,

09:04.129 --> 09:05.717
so if I don't
see you again today,

09:05.855 --> 09:07.926
welcome to the world
of Teletex Electronics.

09:08.064 --> 09:10.032
Thanks, Mr. Hoffman.

09:10.170 --> 09:12.828
I want you to remember
the door to my office
is always open.

09:12.966 --> 09:14.726
If it isn't,
just knock.

09:14.864 --> 09:17.211
Mmm, well,
that's nice to hear.

09:17.349 --> 09:18.730
And if I don't answer,

09:18.868 --> 09:21.457
go away, because it means
I'm in here with my secretary.

09:22.354 --> 09:23.528
Good luck!

09:29.051 --> 09:30.811
He seems like
a real nice guy.

09:31.398 --> 09:32.399
Who?

09:33.055 --> 09:34.090
Mr. Hoffman.

09:34.228 --> 09:37.715
He has a good
personality rating.

09:37.853 --> 09:40.545
Would you mind taking off
your jacket, Mr. Jefferson?

09:40.683 --> 09:41.753
What?
Your jacket.

09:41.891 --> 09:43.583
You'll have
to take it off.

09:47.552 --> 09:49.450
Sit right here, please.

09:50.762 --> 09:52.557
Lift your arms, please.

09:53.006 --> 09:54.317
Thank you.

09:54.455 --> 09:56.423
Um, I believe
my personal history form

09:56.561 --> 09:58.598
is in that file
on Mr. Hoffman's desk.

09:58.736 --> 10:01.117
How do you know that?
Did you peek?

10:01.255 --> 10:04.155
Well, no, it's just that
he was just reading
from it and...

10:04.293 --> 10:05.535
What's this?

10:05.674 --> 10:07.296
A polygraph.

10:07.434 --> 10:08.918
You mean a lie detector?

10:10.195 --> 10:12.439
We prefer to give it
its correct name.

10:12.577 --> 10:13.889
Polygraph.

10:15.753 --> 10:16.754
What are you
going to do with it?

10:16.892 --> 10:18.341
Oh, now,
just relax

10:18.479 --> 10:21.379
and try to answer
the questions
as best you can.

10:21.517 --> 10:23.070
What kind
of questions?

10:23.208 --> 10:26.073
Oh, nothing difficult
and nothing for you
to worry about.

10:26.211 --> 10:28.697
We just want to verify
the information you gave us

10:28.835 --> 10:30.353
on your personal
history form.

10:30.491 --> 10:32.148
Well, why do you have
to verify anything
when I've just...

10:32.286 --> 10:33.771
Oh, now, just relax.

10:33.909 --> 10:35.600
Relax.

10:44.609 --> 10:46.784
Is everything all right
for you, Mr. Prescott?

10:46.922 --> 10:49.165
Oh, splendid, splendid!

10:49.303 --> 10:51.581
You know, you have
a charming apartment here.

10:51.720 --> 10:53.066
Thank you.

10:53.204 --> 10:56.932
And you and Mr. Jefferson
are such charming people too.

10:57.070 --> 10:58.623
Didn't Lionel get home
from work yet?

10:58.761 --> 11:00.349
No, not yet.

11:00.487 --> 11:03.386
Oh, maybe he's staying
late to give his boss
some good advice.

11:04.836 --> 11:07.908
It's nice to see people
so proud of their son.

11:08.046 --> 11:11.740
It's a pity there aren't
more folks like you
in the world, Mr. Jefferson.

11:11.878 --> 11:13.051
I know.

11:15.260 --> 11:18.816
Why don't we take a shot
of the two of you
before he gets here?

11:18.954 --> 11:21.646
Oh, that will
be nice, George.

11:21.784 --> 11:23.544
Splendid, splendid.
Now, Mr. Jefferson,

11:23.683 --> 11:26.824
why don't you put
your arm around
your wife, like this.

11:26.962 --> 11:28.722
I know how.

11:31.967 --> 11:34.072
I thought we'd take
some pictures in color

11:34.210 --> 11:35.936
and some in black-and-white.

11:36.074 --> 11:38.283
Which, in this case,
would be the same thing.

11:46.188 --> 11:49.329
Hey, Lionel,
you're just in time.
Come on, stand over here.

11:49.467 --> 11:52.608
This is my son Lionel
I was telling you about.

11:52.746 --> 11:55.715
Hi.
What a fine-looking
young man.

11:55.853 --> 11:57.717
We're having
our picture taken
in your honor.

11:57.855 --> 11:59.684
Pictures?
Did you have
to work late?

11:59.822 --> 12:00.823
No, Mom.

12:00.961 --> 12:03.343
Now, everybody look over here.

12:03.481 --> 12:07.140
Now, when I count
to three, I want you
all to say, "Cheese."

12:07.278 --> 12:08.589
All right?

12:08.728 --> 12:10.350
One...
How's the job going,
Lionel?

12:10.488 --> 12:12.007
Two...
I don't have
a job anymore.

12:12.145 --> 12:13.525
Three.
Jeez!

12:26.055 --> 12:27.781
What do you mean,
you don't have
a job anymore?

12:27.919 --> 12:29.369
Just what
I said, Pop.

12:29.507 --> 12:31.440
But you just started.
What happened?

12:31.578 --> 12:33.200
Did you talk back
to your boss?
No, Pop.

12:33.338 --> 12:34.339
Stay too long
in the men's room?

12:34.477 --> 12:35.582
Pop, what happened was...

12:35.720 --> 12:36.997
Did they suddenly
notice you're black?

12:37.135 --> 12:38.136
No!

12:39.103 --> 12:41.001
Mr. Jefferson, please!

12:41.139 --> 12:43.107
Give the boy
a chance.

12:43.245 --> 12:44.936
What happened, son?

12:45.488 --> 12:46.662
Well, you see...

12:46.800 --> 12:48.698
Will you keep your
hands off everybody?

12:48.837 --> 12:51.494
He ain't your son,
he's my son.
He's going to tell me.

12:51.632 --> 12:53.289
Now, what happened?

12:53.427 --> 12:56.223
I keep telling you
he's my son too.

12:56.361 --> 12:58.708
I know that.
I just said he
wasn't his son.

12:58.847 --> 13:00.365
Well, I want to hear
what happened,

13:00.503 --> 13:02.782
but Lionel can't talk
unless you shut up.

13:02.920 --> 13:05.025
Okay,
I'm shutting up.

13:05.163 --> 13:07.579
Lionel, tell us
why they fired you.

13:07.717 --> 13:09.996
They didn't fire me, Mom.
I walked out on them.

13:10.134 --> 13:12.274
What? You walked out
on a great job like that?

13:12.412 --> 13:15.139
I thought you said
you were going to shut up.

13:16.519 --> 13:18.245
Go ahead, Lionel.

13:18.383 --> 13:20.558
The first thing they
did was sit me down
to take a lie detector test.

13:20.696 --> 13:22.146
A lie detector test?
Why?

13:22.284 --> 13:23.492
They think you
stole something?

13:24.527 --> 13:26.667
No, they make
everybody take one.

13:26.806 --> 13:29.153
Maybe you'd
like to wait on
these pictures.

13:29.291 --> 13:31.707
Why?
Well, you have this
problem and I...

13:33.985 --> 13:35.815
I was talking
to Lionel.

13:37.955 --> 13:40.820
Why do they make everybody
take a lie detector test?

13:40.958 --> 13:42.545
Well, they say they
just want to verify

13:42.683 --> 13:44.202
a few things about
their background.

13:44.340 --> 13:45.894
So, what happened?
You fail the test?

13:46.032 --> 13:48.517
No, I told them what
they could do with their
test and then I walked out.

13:48.655 --> 13:50.243
Why?

13:50.381 --> 13:52.003
Well, because I
answered every question
on that application.

13:52.141 --> 13:54.178
If they don't
believe me,
the hell with them!

13:54.316 --> 13:55.489
Who said they
didn't believe you?

13:55.627 --> 13:56.801
Pop, the minute
they hooked me up
to that machine

13:56.939 --> 13:58.423
they were saying
they didn't believe me.

13:58.561 --> 14:01.012
You gave up an
$18,000-a-year
job just for that?

14:01.150 --> 14:03.946
Yeah, because nobody's
going to strap a bunch
of electrodes on me

14:04.084 --> 14:06.155
just to make sure
I ain't lying.
It stinks!

14:06.293 --> 14:08.709
You've got a very
bright son there.

14:08.848 --> 14:11.126
He ain't my son.
That's her son talking.

14:13.542 --> 14:16.476
And I'm proud of him.
He was standing up
for his principles.

14:16.614 --> 14:18.167
You see, Mr. Jefferson.

14:18.305 --> 14:19.997
Your wife agrees with me.

14:21.619 --> 14:23.103
What are you
doing here anyway?

14:23.241 --> 14:24.691
Waiting to take a picture.

14:24.829 --> 14:26.003
There ain't gonna be
no pictures taken.

14:26.141 --> 14:28.005
Pack up your stuff
and go home.

14:29.420 --> 14:32.216
Well, back to Bar Mitzvahs.

14:34.425 --> 14:37.600
Okay, Lionel, now, this
is what it's going to be,
no "ifs, ands or buts".

14:37.738 --> 14:39.016
You're gonna go back there
tomorrow morning,

14:39.154 --> 14:40.396
say you're sorry,
and take the test.

14:40.534 --> 14:41.984
I can't.
Why not?

14:42.122 --> 14:44.469
Pop, I just can't.

14:44.607 --> 14:48.197
Lionel, come in
the kitchen a minute.
I want to talk to you.

14:48.335 --> 14:50.475
Why can't you talk
in front of me?

14:50.613 --> 14:52.236
Because this ain't
for your ears to hear.

14:52.374 --> 14:54.859
At a time like this,
a person's got
to talk to a man.

14:54.997 --> 14:56.343
You're right.

14:56.481 --> 14:58.207
And you be sure
to listen to Lionel.

14:58.345 --> 15:00.175
Maybe you can
learn something.

15:04.455 --> 15:06.146
Would you
get out of here!

15:11.117 --> 15:12.739
Sit down, Lionel.

15:16.156 --> 15:18.055
Come on, son. Relax.

15:18.193 --> 15:21.265
You don't have
anything to worry about.
You're among friends now.

15:22.852 --> 15:24.509
What is it, Pop?

15:24.647 --> 15:26.097
Okay, Lionel.

15:26.235 --> 15:28.444
You know I'm your father,
and you know I love you.

15:28.582 --> 15:30.515
You know there's nothing
I wouldn't do for you.

15:30.653 --> 15:31.861
Whatever you say to me now

15:32.000 --> 15:33.449
ain't gonna go outside
of these four walls,

15:33.587 --> 15:36.418
not to your mother,
not to your girl,
not to nobody.

15:36.556 --> 15:37.937
You can trust me.

15:38.075 --> 15:39.421
I know that, Pop.

15:39.559 --> 15:41.009
What are you trying to hide?

15:41.147 --> 15:42.355
What?

15:42.493 --> 15:44.253
What are you afraid
might come out on that test?

15:44.391 --> 15:45.461
Nothing!

15:45.599 --> 15:47.670
Come on, Lionel.
You don't have
to be ashamed.

15:47.808 --> 15:50.466
Everybody's got
something to hide, even me.

15:50.604 --> 15:53.297
You? Well, what have
you got to hide?

15:53.435 --> 15:55.678
Never mind that,
I'm talking about you.

15:57.059 --> 15:59.165
Now, what is this big secret
that you're keeping from us?

15:59.303 --> 16:02.582
I mean did you get
busted or something?
No.

16:02.720 --> 16:04.066
Okay, Lionel, you went
out with a lot of girls

16:04.204 --> 16:05.585
before you took up
with Jenny, didn't you?

16:05.723 --> 16:06.896
Well, sure.

16:08.795 --> 16:11.280
Are there any little
Lionel's running around?

16:13.248 --> 16:15.802
Hey, Pop! Now, that's
a terrible thing to say.

16:15.940 --> 16:17.769
Why? Some of the biggest
people are doing it.

16:17.907 --> 16:19.426
Congressmen, senators.

16:19.564 --> 16:23.085
Some of them got whole
families on the side.

16:23.223 --> 16:25.915
Now, look, Pop,
for the last time, I'm not
trying to hide anything.

16:26.054 --> 16:28.608
Then take the test!
No. No! No!

16:29.298 --> 16:30.541
Lionel...

16:32.232 --> 16:33.751
You still here?

16:40.689 --> 16:42.242
Lionel, I'm your father.

16:42.380 --> 16:45.176
All that talking
and he still
doesn't know that?

16:50.250 --> 16:51.700
Hi, honey.

16:51.838 --> 16:54.392
Here you are, Lionel.
And congratulations!

16:54.530 --> 16:57.533
That's just like you, Willis.
Always saying the wrong thing.

16:57.671 --> 16:59.742
I beg your pardon?
Hey, Jenny,
come on in.

16:59.880 --> 17:03.643
Oh, we're just
in time for pictures.

17:04.954 --> 17:08.855
There's not going
to be any pictures.
Mr. Prescott's leaving.

17:08.993 --> 17:10.615
Something George said?

17:17.139 --> 17:19.245
Well, what's
happening here?

17:20.694 --> 17:23.042
You look like you
just lost your best friend.

17:23.180 --> 17:25.596
Worse than that.
He just lost his best job.

17:25.734 --> 17:28.771
How could he?
He wasn't there long enough
to make a mistake.

17:30.221 --> 17:32.396
Honey, you lost
your job?

17:32.534 --> 17:35.054
Yeah. They wanted
me to take a lie
detector test,

17:35.192 --> 17:36.848
so I said no.

17:36.986 --> 17:38.333
And you walked out
just like that?

17:38.471 --> 17:40.369
I thought that job
meant so much to you.

17:40.507 --> 17:42.406
Not as much as
my right to privacy.

17:42.544 --> 17:44.856
You want privacy?
Lock yourself in the toilet.

17:47.928 --> 17:49.413
All right, now listen,
Mr. Jefferson.

17:49.551 --> 17:51.794
That job means a lot
to both of us,

17:51.932 --> 17:53.624
but if Lionel feels
this strongly about it,

17:53.762 --> 17:56.282
I respect his feelings
and so should you.

17:56.420 --> 17:58.594
Bravo, young lady.
I agree with you.

17:58.732 --> 17:59.733
Prescott!

17:59.871 --> 18:01.977
Yeah, I know.
Shut up and get out.

18:03.289 --> 18:05.912
Can they really force you
to take a test like that?

18:06.050 --> 18:07.224
Yeah. Is it legal?

18:07.362 --> 18:09.122
It is in most states,
unfortunately.

18:09.260 --> 18:12.021
Thousands of companies
around the country use them.

18:12.160 --> 18:13.506
What kind of questions
do they ask?

18:13.644 --> 18:14.886
Oh, they can ask
you anything.

18:15.024 --> 18:17.993
Questions about your past,
your personal lifestyle.

18:18.131 --> 18:20.168
Do they ask you how a kid
could make it all the way
through college

18:20.306 --> 18:22.101
and still come out stupid?

18:23.343 --> 18:25.483
Pop, try to understand.

18:25.621 --> 18:27.209
I don't want people
probing into my mind

18:27.347 --> 18:29.349
and digging into
my innermost feelings.

18:29.487 --> 18:31.972
I don't want to share
that with anybody.

18:32.111 --> 18:33.733
Not even with me?

18:34.665 --> 18:36.563
Hey, with you, anything.

18:38.358 --> 18:39.842
PRESCOTT: Oh, don't...

18:39.980 --> 18:42.121
Don't, don't stop doing that!

18:45.434 --> 18:47.919
This picture I'll give
you for nothing.

18:49.128 --> 18:52.269
But you're missing
a great picture.

18:52.407 --> 18:55.064
Well, George, uh, shall we
open the champagne?

18:55.203 --> 18:56.549
What for?

18:56.687 --> 18:58.102
To drink it.

18:59.724 --> 19:01.830
Oh, come on, George.

19:01.968 --> 19:03.763
Look on the bright side.

19:03.901 --> 19:05.558
Things aren't all black.

19:12.737 --> 19:15.050
What's so great
about that?

19:15.188 --> 19:17.294
Don't be down
on Lionel, George.

19:17.432 --> 19:19.399
It took a lot of courage
to do what he did.

19:20.814 --> 19:23.679
Courage don't buy groceries.
They want cash.

19:26.268 --> 19:27.994
Good evening.
Is Lionel Jefferson
at home?

19:28.132 --> 19:29.720
Yeah. Who are you?
I'm Bill Hoffman,

19:29.858 --> 19:32.032
Personnel Director
for Teletex Electronics.

19:32.171 --> 19:35.035
Oh! Oh! Pleased to meet you.
I'm Lionel's father.

19:35.174 --> 19:37.452
Come on in. Come on in.
Lionel, look who's here.

19:38.867 --> 19:40.317
What are you doing here?

19:40.455 --> 19:42.181
I was hoping
I could talk to you
for a minute, Lionel.

19:42.319 --> 19:44.528
Or for two minutes,
if you've got the time.

19:44.666 --> 19:46.254
Sure he's got
the time.

19:46.392 --> 19:47.427
Meet my wife,
Louise.

19:47.565 --> 19:49.015
How do you do?
Hello.

19:49.153 --> 19:51.224
And these are, uh...
Oh, it don't matter
who they are.

19:54.296 --> 19:57.161
My father's a great
kidder, Mr. Hoffman,
just like you are.

19:57.299 --> 19:59.128
Oh?
And just as funny.

19:59.267 --> 20:01.061
Oh, as good as that, huh?

20:02.373 --> 20:03.823
This is my fiancee,
Jenny Willis.

20:03.961 --> 20:04.996
Hello.
Hello.

20:05.134 --> 20:06.205
And her father.

20:18.700 --> 20:19.770
Tom Willis.

20:20.219 --> 20:21.323
Hello.

20:22.945 --> 20:25.500
Lionel, I heard
what happened
down at work today.

20:25.638 --> 20:27.329
It's a good thing
Tulley didn't take
your advice

20:27.467 --> 20:29.573
about what he could do
with his polygraph.

20:30.850 --> 20:33.853
Sometimes my son
shoots his mouth off
without thinking.

20:33.991 --> 20:35.855
It runs in the family.

20:38.306 --> 20:39.790
If there was
a problem, Lionel,

20:39.928 --> 20:41.895
why didn't you come
and talk to me about it?

20:42.033 --> 20:44.243
Well, I just didn't think
it would do much good.

20:44.381 --> 20:46.659
That's where you're wrong.
We'd still like to have
you at Teletex.

20:46.797 --> 20:49.248
You hear that,
Lionel? You got
your job back.

20:49.386 --> 20:51.940
Does that mean I still
don't have to take
the lie detector test?

20:52.078 --> 20:54.460
That polygraph test
is a harmless
little procedure.

20:54.598 --> 20:56.703
Forget it.
Lionel,
are you crazy?

20:56.841 --> 20:57.842
Lionel, if it were
up to me,

20:57.980 --> 20:59.050
I'd say never mind
the test.

20:59.188 --> 21:00.569
But my boss
insists on it,

21:00.707 --> 21:02.088
and I've got
to follow orders.

21:02.226 --> 21:04.332
Well, would you
jump out of a window

21:04.470 --> 21:07.300
because your boss
ordered you to?

21:07.438 --> 21:10.096
Depends on how big a bonus
he'd give me to do it.

21:12.581 --> 21:14.549
You walked right
into that one.

21:16.309 --> 21:19.347
You see, Lionel,
he's not asking you
to jump out of a window.

21:19.485 --> 21:21.694
He's just asking you
to take a simple test.

21:21.832 --> 21:24.628
It is such a simple thing.
What harm can it do?

21:24.766 --> 21:26.008
Plenty!

21:26.146 --> 21:28.217
Now look, it's bad enough
that you investigate me,

21:28.356 --> 21:31.151
ask my friends all sorts of
personal questions about me.

21:31.290 --> 21:33.913
But when you want to
hook me up to a machine
to dig into my head

21:34.051 --> 21:36.364
to find out what
makes me tick,
that's going too far.

21:36.502 --> 21:37.537
Lionel, we've got to know...

21:37.675 --> 21:39.090
You have no right to
know that much about me!

21:39.228 --> 21:41.714
You're not buying me,
you're only hiring me.

21:49.791 --> 21:51.344
What's he
talking about?

21:51.482 --> 21:55.521
He's trying to tell you
he's not ready for
big brother yet.

21:56.694 --> 22:00.077
Lionel, please reconsider.
As a favor to me.

22:00.215 --> 22:02.044
A favor? A favor?

22:02.182 --> 22:06.221
Wait a minute.
Lionel, he's not here
to save your job.

22:06.359 --> 22:07.981
He's here to save his.

22:09.224 --> 22:10.881
Say what?
Yeah.

22:11.019 --> 22:12.745
Mom's right.

22:12.883 --> 22:15.644
Teletex Electronics
hired me for three reasons.

22:15.782 --> 22:19.614
I'm young, I'm a college
graduate and I'm black.

22:23.687 --> 22:26.552
That's not true.
We'd have hired you
even if you weren't young.

22:33.317 --> 22:35.457
Come on, Hoffman, you know
what he's talking about.

22:35.595 --> 22:40.220
Well, we do feel a
responsibility to give
minorities a chance.

22:40.359 --> 22:42.809
You mean the only
reason you're here is
because Lionel's black?

22:42.947 --> 22:45.294
No. I was going over
his file again...

22:45.433 --> 22:46.675
More investigating?

22:46.813 --> 22:49.678
He's got one of
the best records
I've ever come across.

22:49.816 --> 22:53.786
I'm here because I think
you're gonna make
a damn good engineer.

22:53.924 --> 22:56.167
This isn't another one
of your little jokes, is it?

22:56.961 --> 22:58.894
No. I mean that.

23:02.691 --> 23:03.968
Thanks.

23:04.106 --> 23:06.039
I mean something else too.

23:06.177 --> 23:08.283
I want you to start
work in the morning.

23:09.042 --> 23:10.389
Okay!
Good!

23:12.391 --> 23:13.564
Hey, wait a minute.

23:13.702 --> 23:15.773
What about that
lie detector test?

23:15.911 --> 23:17.499
Forget it.

23:17.637 --> 23:20.778
But I thought your boss
said everybody had to
take a lie detector test?

23:20.916 --> 23:22.331
That's right.

23:22.470 --> 23:23.919
What'll you tell him
when he asks
if Lionel took one?

23:24.506 --> 23:25.714
I'll lie.

23:34.171 --> 23:36.691
Would somebody open
the door for me, please?

23:36.829 --> 23:37.830
Where are you going?

23:37.968 --> 23:39.107
I'm leaving.
Leaving?

23:39.245 --> 23:40.626
I thought you were
here to take our picture.

23:40.764 --> 23:42.904
Yes, but...
Then why aren't you
taking our picture?

23:43.042 --> 23:44.146
And make it quick.

23:44.284 --> 23:46.597
We're taking the
Willis's out to dinner.

23:46.735 --> 23:49.289
Now, wait a minute, George.
Dinner is our treat.

23:49.428 --> 23:52.396
That's right, Mr. Jefferson.
We invited you, remember?

23:52.534 --> 23:53.846
It's no use, Jenny.

23:53.984 --> 23:56.435
When George wants to pay
for something, he pays for it.

23:56.573 --> 23:58.160
Me? I'm not paying.

23:58.298 --> 23:59.748
But you said...
Lionel is!

23:59.886 --> 24:02.337
Me?
Sure. You got a job
now, don't you?

24:03.372 --> 24:05.340
And you don't even
have to take the test.

24:05.478 --> 24:06.859
I know.

24:06.997 --> 24:08.930
But what about
all the poor guys
who still have to?

24:09.378 --> 24:11.242
Right.

24:11.380 --> 24:14.453
I just hope they got fathers
as understanding as I am.

24:41.514 --> 24:46.036
LOUISE: The Jeffersons was
recorded on tape in front of
a studio audience.
