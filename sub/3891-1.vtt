01:06.858 --> 01:11.821
HOPE

01:33.009 --> 01:37.013
HOPE’S STORE
STATIONERY - GROCERIES

01:45.021 --> 01:47.524
When’s the meeting?

01:47.857 --> 01:49.024
What?

01:49.109 --> 01:51.610
You’re ready already?

01:51.694 --> 01:55.198
Okay, okay. Hold on.

01:55.865 --> 01:56.824
Man--

01:57.200 --> 02:01.579
<i>You never came to</i>
<i>the PTA meetings last year.</i>

02:01.663 --> 02:04.248
<i>If you’re late,</i>
<i>you’ll get on their bad side.</i>

02:04.332 --> 02:07.084
I’m almost ready.

02:07.169 --> 02:10.296
I didn’t even do the breakfast dishes.

02:10.380 --> 02:13.048
<i>Do that later and come out now.</i>

02:13.133 --> 02:14.842
Okay, okay.

02:15.385 --> 02:18.263
I’m ready! I’m leaving! I’m on my way.

02:19.722 --> 02:21.683
I’m going! I’m on my way!

02:22.392 --> 02:24.060
Where do I go?

02:24.852 --> 02:26.229
Dog meat?

02:27.272 --> 02:29.274
I can’t eat that.

02:30.608 --> 02:32.902
SAFETY FIRST

02:54.424 --> 02:58.010
It’s time for our lunch break.

02:58.094 --> 03:03.266
Today’s menu is chicken soup.

03:03.350 --> 03:07.311
I, the factory manager,
will eat last as always.

03:07.395 --> 03:13.359
Please only take one piece
for those behind you.

03:13.443 --> 03:14.611
Hey, you!

03:15.570 --> 03:18.865
Don’t eat two pieces like last time
or I’ll kill you.

03:19.949 --> 03:21.534
Dong-hoon?

03:21.618 --> 03:22.868
Let’s eat together.

03:22.952 --> 03:24.036
Okay.

03:24.120 --> 03:28.625
Cheers everyone.

03:33.463 --> 03:38.216
Summer break is coming up.
What should we get the teacher?

03:38.301 --> 03:39.885
How about a dress?

03:39.969 --> 03:42.012
-Good idea.
-Great.

03:42.096 --> 03:44.349
What do you think, Mi-hee?

03:44.932 --> 03:46.141
Huh?

03:46.226 --> 03:50.062
How about a flowerpot?

03:50.146 --> 03:51.439
Forget it.

03:51.981 --> 03:54.275
These days, we give gift cards.

03:54.359 --> 03:55.777
Right.

03:57.362 --> 03:58.821
How much should we give?

03:58.905 --> 04:02.074
You decide, Vice President.

04:02.158 --> 04:03.784
-Of course.
-Yeah.

04:03.868 --> 04:05.243
Let’s go.

04:05.328 --> 04:07.621
I’ll text you how much we’ll pitch in.

04:07.705 --> 04:10.082
-It was good.
-Yeah.

04:10.166 --> 04:13.251
-I’m full.
-Did we collect money today?

04:13.336 --> 04:16.254
-How much do we pay?
-We ate a lot.

04:16.339 --> 04:19.883
Hope’s mom, you’ll pay?

04:19.967 --> 04:22.177
-Me?
-Why not?

04:22.262 --> 04:26.599
How about you and I
split the bill this time?

04:26.683 --> 04:28.392
I didn’t even eat!

04:28.476 --> 04:32.855
She’s too busy at the store
and never came out much.

04:33.273 --> 04:37.193
She always said
she should treat you ladies.

04:38.361 --> 04:40.488
Should we give Hope’s mom a chance then?

04:40.572 --> 04:41.698
Why not?

04:42.365 --> 04:43.991
-Thanks, Hope’s mom.
-Thanks.

04:47.537 --> 04:48.705
How much you got?

04:52.375 --> 04:54.085
I have 20,000 won.

04:54.711 --> 04:56.170
Take credit cards?

05:00.216 --> 05:03.386
198,000 won? That’s insane.

05:03.470 --> 05:06.430
Damn women ate a whole dog.

05:06.514 --> 05:08.516
It’s to get on their good side

05:08.600 --> 05:11.894
or else your kid will get left out.

05:11.978 --> 05:13.061
WATERMELON 20,000 won

05:13.145 --> 05:15.357
Why’s it so dang expensive?

05:17.191 --> 05:21.153
Tell your husband
to give Hope’s dad a raise.

05:21.237 --> 05:24.407
He’s only the manager, not the boss.

05:25.908 --> 05:28.870
By the way, aren’t you going to tell him?

05:29.621 --> 05:32.956
How can he not tell?
Looks like it’s a boy.

05:33.040 --> 05:35.543
He has no interest in me.

05:35.627 --> 05:39.506
Then how’d you end up getting pregnant?

05:40.590 --> 05:44.636
Honestly, we did it once in three years
and it happened.

05:45.762 --> 05:47.472
Three years?

05:48.055 --> 05:51.016
My husband is always all over me.

05:51.100 --> 05:53.769
He can’t get enough of me.

05:53.853 --> 05:56.939
How can I raise two when one is so hard?

05:57.023 --> 05:58.356
Don’t say that.

05:58.441 --> 06:01.611
Have the baby. It’ll grow on its own.

06:04.614 --> 06:05.907
None left?

06:07.450 --> 06:08.701
Nope.

06:10.202 --> 06:12.371
No sense of loyalty.

06:21.923 --> 06:24.133
Im Dong-hoon, is it good?

06:25.134 --> 06:25.968
Yup.

06:28.971 --> 06:31.974
-I only ate one, honest.
-The bones can’t be from one.

06:36.312 --> 06:38.314
-Like it?
-It’s good.

06:40.149 --> 06:41.817
Don’t you get food at home?

06:41.901 --> 06:44.111
Yeah, I do. Just rice though.

06:45.029 --> 06:49.575
I’m so skinny, but my wife’s getting fat.

06:49.659 --> 06:53.663
Good for you, pal.
I can’t eat at home or here.

06:54.456 --> 06:56.665
I only get rice at home and here.

06:56.749 --> 07:01.128
And my three sons say I stink
and won’t ever come to me.

07:04.048 --> 07:05.550
Want it?

07:06.634 --> 07:08.928
-Forget it, man.
-Fine.

07:18.730 --> 07:21.857
Give it to me. You got three of the same.

07:21.941 --> 07:24.318
But this is a rare card.

07:24.861 --> 07:26.612
Yours isn’t.

07:26.696 --> 07:27.989
Want it?

07:28.781 --> 07:30.742
Let’s trade with this.

07:31.367 --> 07:33.495
This one for five of those.

07:34.203 --> 07:37.164
Young-seok, you cheapskate.

07:37.248 --> 07:40.084
-No deal, cheapskate.
-Let’s go.

07:59.228 --> 08:00.062
What?

08:01.939 --> 08:03.065
What?

08:14.577 --> 08:16.245
Wait for me!

08:31.218 --> 08:32.386
Dang!

08:33.054 --> 08:35.513
I died again! This sucks!

08:35.598 --> 08:37.600
Hey, Han Young-seok.

08:38.392 --> 08:39.351
What?

08:39.435 --> 08:41.771
That’s not yours. Don’t hit it.

08:42.479 --> 08:47.317
I paid to play on this. What’s it to you?

08:47.401 --> 08:50.613
Why you little--
Don’t try bossing me around!

08:51.614 --> 08:53.199
Little?

09:00.122 --> 09:02.791
Fine. Your face is way bigger. So there.

09:02.875 --> 09:04.752
Wanna die!

09:05.377 --> 09:07.421
Mommy, I’m home.

09:08.172 --> 09:09.549
Hi, Hope.

09:17.849 --> 09:20.560
Young-seok is the problem.

09:21.060 --> 09:22.436
What are you grumbling?

09:27.524 --> 09:30.152
Try this. Ahh.

09:33.239 --> 09:36.408
I don’t get this at all.

09:36.492 --> 09:37.660
Get what?

09:37.744 --> 09:40.830
It’s a math question.

09:41.247 --> 09:44.917
I can solve most questions,

09:45.001 --> 09:48.170
but I have no clue with this.

09:48.254 --> 09:51.173
How can a second grade math question
be so hard?

09:51.257 --> 09:52.925
Read it again.

09:53.009 --> 09:54.760
Should I ask Daddy?

09:54.844 --> 09:55.928
Daddy?

09:56.012 --> 09:58.681
He probably won’t know more than me.

10:00.016 --> 10:01.599
Come eat!

10:01.684 --> 10:07.981
“Young-su has nine pencils
and Jin-hee has three.

10:08.065 --> 10:13.486
How can they have
the same number of pencils?

10:13.570 --> 10:15.114
Write your answer.”

10:15.572 --> 10:17.700
What did you write?

10:17.784 --> 10:19.160
Nothing.

10:19.744 --> 10:20.912
Why?

10:21.537 --> 10:27.501
Just add nine and three together,
then divide by two.

10:27.877 --> 10:31.338
It’s not that easy.

10:31.422 --> 10:35.467
Think that Young-su is Young-seok

10:35.551 --> 10:38.553
and Jin-hee is me.

10:38.638 --> 10:40.180
Young-seok?

10:40.264 --> 10:45.394
There’s no way
Young-seok would give the pencils.

10:46.562 --> 10:51.567
For us to have the same,
he’d have to give me three pencils.

10:52.735 --> 10:57.405
There’s no way he’d ever give me anything.

10:57.489 --> 11:00.492
That’s not the answer.

11:01.744 --> 11:04.956
Dong-hoon, say something.

11:06.165 --> 11:10.461
Listen to your mom.
Don’t start fighting with her.

11:18.219 --> 11:20.178
Spicy noodles give me ulcers.

11:20.262 --> 11:23.181
-Don’t eat it then.
-I didn’t say I won’t.

11:23.265 --> 11:27.019
Forget it. Go watch baseball.
I’ll raise Hope by myself.

11:28.479 --> 11:29.856
Really?

11:32.441 --> 11:34.360
Listen good to your mom.

11:37.947 --> 11:39.323
Stupid.

11:46.122 --> 11:48.082
Let’s get you to bed.

11:51.460 --> 11:54.838
<i>Kokomong, the sausage</i>

11:54.922 --> 11:58.300
<i>Silly, playful Kokomong</i>

11:58.384 --> 12:02.304
<i>A whiz inventor, Kokomong</i>

12:02.388 --> 12:05.474
<i>Leader of the kids, Kokomong</i>

12:06.475 --> 12:08.770
Young-seok, you waiting for Hope?

12:09.145 --> 12:13.398
No way. I’m not waiting for her.

12:13.482 --> 12:15.108
Then what are you doing here?

12:15.192 --> 12:17.903
I’m waiting for the boys.

12:17.987 --> 12:20.155
-Let’s go!
-Okay. Let’s go.

12:20.239 --> 12:22.241
But Hope will be out soon.

12:23.993 --> 12:26.495
Daddy, do you know how to tie hair?

12:26.913 --> 12:28.664
Of course I do.

12:29.748 --> 12:31.000
Come here.

12:33.377 --> 12:34.420
Sit down.

12:37.089 --> 12:38.800
GWANG-SIK

12:45.722 --> 12:47.766
I’m on my way out.

12:49.435 --> 12:50.853
Your second child’s sick?

12:52.604 --> 12:55.524
The flu? Oh, no.

12:55.983 --> 12:57.776
I can get there in 20 minutes.

12:59.695 --> 13:05.283
Sign for the goods,
then open the warehouse.

13:05.367 --> 13:07.369
Okay. Bye.

13:08.955 --> 13:10.957
Ouch! Forget it!

13:11.415 --> 13:12.708
Why?

13:13.918 --> 13:16.628
-I’ll tie it up pretty.
-Forget it!

13:16.712 --> 13:20.257
I always just pin my hair.

13:21.717 --> 13:24.136
Mommy’s always busy.

13:24.220 --> 13:28.099
You look prettier with your hair pinned.

13:37.191 --> 13:38.650
Hope went to school, right?

13:38.734 --> 13:41.153
-She’s still home.
-Oh, no. She’s late.

13:41.237 --> 13:44.156
-Got it.
-The other kids already went?

13:44.240 --> 13:47.159
I gotta go check on stuff coming in.

13:47.243 --> 13:48.701
Where’s the umbrella?

13:48.785 --> 13:51.579
-Look under the counter.
-Okay.

13:51.663 --> 13:55.376
Hope, you’ll be late!

14:15.729 --> 14:16.898
What the--

14:36.876 --> 14:38.377
WILL BE RIGHT BACK

14:42.756 --> 14:45.175
I’m all wet! Run!

14:45.259 --> 14:48.137
Hey, this way!

14:48.679 --> 14:50.306
It’s cold!

14:52.266 --> 14:53.976
Hope!

14:54.977 --> 14:55.937
Yeah?

14:56.812 --> 14:58.314
Don’t pout.

14:59.273 --> 15:02.943
I’ll tie your hair pretty tomorrow.

15:03.027 --> 15:04.569
You always say that.

15:04.653 --> 15:06.738
All grown up?

15:06.822 --> 15:08.991
Talking back to your mom.

15:11.702 --> 15:15.247
Want Mommy to walk you to school?

15:15.331 --> 15:19.251
Forget it.
I can run there in three minutes.

15:19.335 --> 15:25.257
Don’t go down muddy alleys
and take the big road.

15:25.341 --> 15:27.009
I was going to anyway.

15:31.097 --> 15:33.098
Take the big road!

15:33.182 --> 15:35.892
VIENNA PIANO

16:17.434 --> 16:20.812
If we’re late, we’re dead! Run!

16:21.563 --> 16:24.525
It’s pouring! I’m so cold!

16:25.859 --> 16:29.780
Wait for me! Slow down!

16:41.917 --> 16:44.461
Hey! Hurry up!

16:52.636 --> 16:55.222
Wait up!

17:12.281 --> 17:13.782
Going to school?

17:17.078 --> 17:19.538
That’s a pretty umbrella.

17:25.627 --> 17:27.921
Mind sharing it with me?

17:29.298 --> 17:33.594
But... I’m late for school.

17:47.316 --> 17:49.610
Come in!

17:51.362 --> 17:54.698
They’re coming in now.
I’ll count everything.

17:55.366 --> 17:56.449
Don’t worry.

17:56.533 --> 17:57.743
Be careful!

18:05.334 --> 18:08.254
Why’s the gas bill so high?

18:54.716 --> 18:55.800
Yeah?

18:55.884 --> 18:57.719
<i>Where are you?</i>

18:57.803 --> 18:59.304
At home.

18:59.388 --> 19:01.431
<i>Oh, my, my, my.</i>

19:01.515 --> 19:03.559
What? Something happened?

19:04.768 --> 19:08.397
There are cops everywhere
outside the school.

19:10.191 --> 19:11.316
<i>The school?</i>

19:11.400 --> 19:15.654
I came by to give Young-seok his umbrella.

19:16.572 --> 19:19.657
But you know
the construction site near here?

19:19.741 --> 19:23.036
One girl was found half dead here.

19:24.830 --> 19:27.749
<i>Hello? You hear me?</i>

19:32.963 --> 19:34.506
Hello?

19:34.590 --> 19:36.841
<i>This is Inspector Seo.</i>

19:36.925 --> 19:38.885
<i>Are you Im Hope’s father?</i>

19:40.721 --> 19:42.096
Yes, I am.

19:42.181 --> 19:47.394
<i>Hope’s hurt badly.</i>
<i>We’re taking her to Chang-won Hospital.</i>

19:48.270 --> 19:51.939
The hospital?
My daughter should be in school.

19:52.023 --> 19:54.317
<i>She’s going in and out of consciousness.</i>

19:54.401 --> 19:57.279
<i>Please come as fast as you can.</i>

19:58.530 --> 20:01.492
<i>Hello? Hello?</i>

20:02.493 --> 20:06.538
EMERGENCY

20:10.792 --> 20:14.129
How was she when you first found her?

20:14.963 --> 20:18.925
She had severe facial injuries
and was bleeding all over

20:19.009 --> 20:20.552
and barely conscious.

20:20.636 --> 20:22.512
Then who made the report?

20:22.596 --> 20:25.807
-We got a call from 911.
-Really?

20:25.891 --> 20:27.809
She called us directly.

20:39.280 --> 20:41.365
Are you Hope’s mother?

20:42.491 --> 20:45.286
Please calm down, ma’am.

20:49.373 --> 20:56.296
The CT scan shows many cuts
and lacerations from the rectum to colon.

20:56.380 --> 20:59.090
She needs surgery.

20:59.174 --> 21:00.091
IM HOPE

21:00.175 --> 21:04.596
<i>We may have to remove</i>
<i>parts of the large and small intestines.</i>

21:07.683 --> 21:09.310
Hope!

21:30.789 --> 21:32.708
IN SURGERY

21:37.253 --> 21:39.547
What happens now?

21:39.631 --> 21:42.384
The forensics results will come soon.

21:43.427 --> 21:47.847
We’ll find the culprit. Don’t worry, sir.

21:47.931 --> 21:53.770
Constable Lee, stay here
and keep reporting on her status.

22:03.572 --> 22:06.991
It happened by the school?

22:07.075 --> 22:08.369
How’d you know?

22:08.994 --> 22:11.037
Which road was she on?

22:12.038 --> 22:14.290
Was it the big road?

22:14.375 --> 22:16.376
What do you mean?

22:16.460 --> 22:18.837
I told her to go that way.

22:20.756 --> 22:24.175
I sent her out alone in the rain.

22:25.010 --> 22:26.970
Cut it out.

22:32.934 --> 22:35.937
Did Young-seok’s mom know it was Hope?

22:36.563 --> 22:40.358
She called me,
said a girl was dying near the school.

22:40.817 --> 22:43.319
-Stop it.
-I can’t.

22:43.404 --> 22:47.407
If she tells one person it was our Hope,

22:47.491 --> 22:49.033
I’ll rip her mouth off!

22:49.117 --> 22:50.411
Please.

22:55.707 --> 22:57.125
My little girl--

23:00.837 --> 23:03.298
Im Hope’s guardian, please?

23:04.090 --> 23:05.717
Did the surgery go well?

23:05.801 --> 23:08.260
Someone had better come in now.

23:08.344 --> 23:09.596
Just one, please.

23:10.972 --> 23:13.559
Stay here. I’ll be right back.

23:27.656 --> 23:28.990
Listen carefully.

23:29.866 --> 23:33.578
We have to remove
the large intestine and anus.

23:33.662 --> 23:37.373
If we don’t do it now, she could die.

23:37.458 --> 23:41.211
Sir, she’ll live
if we make an artificial anus.

23:42.713 --> 23:44.506
An artificial anus?

23:44.590 --> 23:46.758
A colostomy to put
the small intestine outside.

23:47.634 --> 23:50.929
She’ll have to live like that for life.

23:58.311 --> 23:59.855
Please save her.

24:36.558 --> 24:38.059
What happened?

24:44.315 --> 24:45.901
Is she alive?

26:16.992 --> 26:20.662
Daddy, you came?

26:21.496 --> 26:23.248
Yes.

26:25.709 --> 26:27.836
Where’s Mommy?

26:28.962 --> 26:32.465
We’re taking turns. She’s right outside.

26:33.008 --> 26:37.095
We’ll always be here. Don’t worry.

26:37.553 --> 26:39.139
Okay.

26:43.894 --> 26:49.149
The doctor says you’re all right, Hope.

26:49.733 --> 26:51.067
Yeah.

26:51.652 --> 26:55.656
What about work?

26:58.533 --> 26:59.868
Work?

27:02.537 --> 27:04.372
I’m all done.

27:07.793 --> 27:13.298
I thought Mommy and you would be busy.

27:15.008 --> 27:20.013
The bad man should be caught.

27:21.306 --> 27:24.768
I was really hurt.

27:27.062 --> 27:30.190
So I just called 911.

27:30.899 --> 27:32.400
Good.

27:33.401 --> 27:35.486
When did you get so smart?

27:36.697 --> 27:39.407
He was wearing beige pants.

27:40.408 --> 27:44.328
And a vest with many pockets.

27:44.412 --> 27:45.706
Who?

27:46.748 --> 27:49.084
The bad man.

27:49.918 --> 27:53.546
He should be caught.

27:54.672 --> 27:59.176
Let’s talk about that later. Okay?

27:59.260 --> 28:02.222
It was near the school.

28:03.348 --> 28:08.770
I’m so sleepy. What if I forget?

28:10.605 --> 28:11.939
It’s okay.

28:12.023 --> 28:16.694
The police say they almost caught him.

28:17.320 --> 28:19.948
-Really?
-Yes.

28:20.531 --> 28:22.575
After you get a good sleep,

28:25.245 --> 28:30.291
Daddy and the police will catch him.

28:31.126 --> 28:32.878
Go to sleep, sweetie.

28:33.795 --> 28:36.923
Okay, Daddy.

28:38.842 --> 28:41.469
My throat feels dry.

28:42.428 --> 28:46.182
And I feel like I have to poop.

29:29.267 --> 29:30.310
Yes, sir.

29:32.187 --> 29:33.688
Yes, Chief.

29:41.654 --> 29:44.199
Results came for the fingerprints
found at the scene.

29:45.325 --> 29:47.702
Did they find him? Arrest him?

29:48.369 --> 29:52.707
We found a match out of ex-cons
and located his whereabouts.

29:56.878 --> 29:59.089
Why aren’t you arresting him?

30:00.924 --> 30:03.885
Constable Lee, why did you bring him here?

30:06.429 --> 30:09.473
Have a seat, sir.

30:09.557 --> 30:11.017
Who’s the bastard?

30:11.517 --> 30:12.935
Where does he live?

30:13.019 --> 30:16.480
I’m not allowed to give you any details.

30:16.564 --> 30:19.566
You have his prints! You know who he is!

30:19.650 --> 30:23.238
But we can’t arrest him
with just his fingerprints.

30:27.242 --> 30:29.244
He’s here? Who is it?

30:31.830 --> 30:36.500
There’s not enough evidence.
I can’t arrest him without a warrant.

30:36.584 --> 30:38.585
Why can’t you get a warrant?

30:38.669 --> 30:39.879
Sir?

30:39.963 --> 30:44.383
The fingerprints could be
from anyone passing through.

30:44.467 --> 30:47.344
We need more definite evidence
for a warrant.

30:47.428 --> 30:49.180
What more evidence do you need?

30:49.264 --> 30:53.225
Like surveillance camera footage or DNA.

30:53.309 --> 30:57.272
There were no cameras at the scene
and no DNA yet.

30:58.773 --> 31:05.446
If the victim testifies
and identifies him,

31:05.530 --> 31:07.866
we won’t need a warrant.

31:08.950 --> 31:10.118
Testify?

31:11.619 --> 31:15.498
Can you arrest him now?

31:17.292 --> 31:21.045
She can’t get investigated like that.

31:21.129 --> 31:23.255
It’s just testifying.

31:23.339 --> 31:26.134
Whatever. She’s your child.

31:27.343 --> 31:30.054
You want her to recall that horrific day?

31:30.138 --> 31:32.640
You call yourself a father?

31:33.599 --> 31:36.644
Don’t you have any feelings?

31:37.478 --> 31:38.980
Feelings?

31:42.025 --> 31:45.445
Fine. Let’s say I don’t.

31:46.779 --> 31:48.530
Ma’am?

31:48.614 --> 31:52.534
Sunflower Center helps
sexually abused children.

31:52.618 --> 31:56.289
They help children deal with the trauma.

31:58.083 --> 32:01.127
Why did this happen to our little girl?

32:01.211 --> 32:05.547
If the cops would have watched
those guys better,

32:05.631 --> 32:07.424
this wouldn’t have happened!

32:07.508 --> 32:09.094
Sit down.

32:10.011 --> 32:12.013
We have to get that bastard!

32:12.638 --> 32:14.473
Please calm down.

32:14.557 --> 32:16.809
How can we?

32:27.112 --> 32:32.408
Please go home
and bring her toys and journals.

32:33.701 --> 32:34.577
What?

32:35.036 --> 32:37.788
That’s what the therapist asked for.

32:37.872 --> 32:40.208
I’ll try to convince your wife.

33:45.356 --> 33:49.194
KOKOMONG

33:51.362 --> 33:54.407
KOKOMONG

34:08.046 --> 34:11.215
Must you do this now?

34:11.299 --> 34:13.718
We have to catch the culprit.

34:15.511 --> 34:18.222
It’s only been three days.

34:18.306 --> 34:20.975
She’s psychologically unstable.

34:22.143 --> 34:23.561
Are you sure?

34:24.854 --> 34:26.981
It’ll be the same no matter when.

34:28.149 --> 34:29.900
It’s not easy for her.

34:31.819 --> 34:34.905
I won’t do it
without the parents’ consent.

34:46.792 --> 34:48.503
Hope

34:49.254 --> 34:51.797
asked to catch the culprit.

34:55.176 --> 34:57.428
Are you sure about this?

35:00.515 --> 35:01.724
Yes.

35:07.355 --> 35:08.606
Sweetie?

35:09.149 --> 35:10.858
Can you talk?

35:16.531 --> 35:18.366
You don’t want to?

35:24.414 --> 35:26.624
Then you can just nod.

35:28.876 --> 35:30.545
Can you see me?

35:37.177 --> 35:39.929
<i>Kokomong, the sausage</i>

35:40.555 --> 35:43.266
<i>Silly, playful Kokomong</i>

35:46.436 --> 35:48.854
I’m pretty, aren’t I?

35:57.988 --> 35:59.448
As you see,

35:59.532 --> 36:05.205
Im Hope can state opinions
and is clearly conscious.

36:08.624 --> 36:09.875
Sweetie?

36:10.460 --> 36:12.753
It rained a lot that day, right?

36:20.553 --> 36:25.266
You met a bad man on the way
to school and had a close call?

36:30.480 --> 36:32.315
About the bad man--

36:33.608 --> 36:35.776
Think you can tell me?

37:29.330 --> 37:30.748
Hope?

37:31.457 --> 37:32.958
Is this the man?

37:35.127 --> 37:38.464
What makes you think this is him?

37:40.883 --> 37:42.635
The face.

37:43.093 --> 37:44.887
Eyes.

37:45.846 --> 37:47.432
Mouth.

37:48.558 --> 37:49.767
Really?

37:51.519 --> 37:52.936
Just in case,

37:53.020 --> 37:58.984
can you choose from other pictures too?

38:02.780 --> 38:04.198
Hope?

38:05.658 --> 38:08.828
Can you point him out again?

38:12.582 --> 38:17.419
Hope? Can we give it another try?

38:17.503 --> 38:18.879
Good girl.

38:40.485 --> 38:43.821
As time goes,
she could behave differently.

38:44.822 --> 38:47.658
She could suddenly start screaming

38:47.742 --> 38:50.160
or not talk at all.

38:52.246 --> 38:54.206
What do you mean?

38:58.210 --> 39:01.171
She needs both physical
and emotional healing.

39:01.255 --> 39:04.174
It may be hard
with just the family’s help.

39:05.551 --> 39:10.097
The whole family
may all need treatment too.

39:10.848 --> 39:12.558

Don’t scare us with things
that didn’t even happen.

39:25.029 --> 39:26.780
What’s with you?

39:26.864 --> 39:30.117
If you’re done, I suggest you leave.

39:53.348 --> 39:54.975
<i>Who is it?</i>

39:55.059 --> 39:57.018
I came to get the dishes.

39:57.102 --> 39:58.937
<i>I left them outside.</i>

39:59.021 --> 40:01.523
I don’t see them. Where?

40:01.607 --> 40:04.026
<i>Of course they’re there.</i>

40:06.278 --> 40:08.448
You son of a--

40:17.498 --> 40:20.917
Must we do this?
I don’t want the room with six patients.

40:21.001 --> 40:22.545
We don’t have a choice.

40:28.801 --> 40:30.302
Yes, Constable Lee.

40:31.887 --> 40:33.097
Yes.

40:36.308 --> 40:37.852
Thank you.

40:40.563 --> 40:43.524
-I’d better go to the police.
-Did they catch him?

40:44.108 --> 40:45.443
I’ll be back.

41:13.428 --> 41:14.514
Let me in.

41:15.180 --> 41:16.348
Chief!

41:18.058 --> 41:19.810
Why’d he come here?

41:19.894 --> 41:21.562
Let me in!

41:23.105 --> 41:24.690
-You can’t, sir!
-Let me in!

41:24.774 --> 41:26.357
-Let me in!
-Wait!

41:26.441 --> 41:29.653
-Let me see his face!
-Sir, are you the victim’s father?

41:29.737 --> 41:32.488

45:00.655 --> 45:04.618
-Stop! Go away!
-Hope! Hope!

45:05.244 --> 45:08.288
Don’t move! Don’t move!

45:08.372 --> 45:10.749
-Go away!
-I’ll clean it!

45:10.833 --> 45:12.126
Stop!

45:13.460 --> 45:15.545
Stay still!

45:15.629 --> 45:18.841
Stop it! Go away!

45:41.822 --> 45:42.990
No.

45:44.449 --> 45:45.700
No.

45:49.079 --> 45:50.747
Hope.

45:51.791 --> 45:52.958
No.

45:54.168 --> 45:55.169
No.

45:56.837 --> 45:58.380
Your wife fainted!

46:00.257 --> 46:02.633
-Her breathing is unstable.
-Help her breathing.

46:02.717 --> 46:03.886
Bring the respirator.

46:04.511 --> 46:06.972
-She’s bleeding!
-Saline!

46:07.056 --> 46:08.765
Her heartbeat is too high!

46:12.352 --> 46:13.312
Call pediatrics.

46:23.572 --> 46:25.740
I was going to tell you.

46:28.035 --> 46:32.998
After what happened to Hope, I lost track.

46:39.463 --> 46:41.381
Are you mad?

46:46.261 --> 46:47.888
Why?

46:49.348 --> 46:52.559
How can you not tell me for five months?

46:56.313 --> 46:57.982
By chance,

47:00.109 --> 47:02.069
were you not going to give birth?

47:03.153 --> 47:05.155
They said the baby’s fine.

47:14.581 --> 47:16.208
Don’t cry.

47:20.337 --> 47:23.590
CHANG-WON HOSPITAL

47:56.373 --> 48:00.335
I know it must be hard for you, sweetie.

48:02.712 --> 48:05.049
But Mommy’s sick.

48:06.841 --> 48:08.552
She can’t come by often.

48:11.846 --> 48:14.934
You said you wanted a sibling, right?

48:19.896 --> 48:23.900
There’s a little brother
or sister in Mommy’s tummy.

48:25.819 --> 48:27.487
Know what that means?

48:34.828 --> 48:36.788
Aren’t you hot?

48:41.668 --> 48:43.253
You don’t like Daddy?

48:45.839 --> 48:46.966
Don’t know?

48:48.842 --> 48:51.136
Hope, are you embarrassed?

48:55.099 --> 48:57.684
It’s Daddy. Don’t be--

49:03.815 --> 49:05.692
I’ll be outside

49:08.988 --> 49:10.364
so you can cool off.

49:11.906 --> 49:13.617
Don’t cover your face.

49:27.631 --> 49:31.635
The therapist asked me
to give this to you.

49:35.097 --> 49:38.350
The woman from Sunflower Center
who was here before.

50:19.308 --> 50:20.392
Oh, my.

50:26.022 --> 50:27.357
What are you doing?

50:27.441 --> 50:28.775
Well, I’m--

50:34.030 --> 50:36.158
-It’s nothing.
-Are you okay?

50:44.791 --> 50:46.460
It comes to 2,870,000 won.

50:56.928 --> 50:59.431
The trial is set
for 11:00 am next Tuesday.

51:13.820 --> 51:17.324
Dong-hoon? Hold on. It’s too noisy here.

51:18.367 --> 51:20.744
<i>Why didn’t you call me earlier?</i>

51:21.828 --> 51:22.995
<i>Hello?</i>

51:23.079 --> 51:24.748
<i>Still there?</i>

51:25.499 --> 51:27.167
About my severance--

51:27.251 --> 51:29.710
What are you talking about?

51:29.794 --> 51:32.506
You’re on vacation. What severance?

51:33.340 --> 51:35.925
I’ve been here for two weeks.

51:36.635 --> 51:38.803
I don’t know when it’ll end.

51:38.887 --> 51:41.681
-There’s the trial too.
<i>-Be honest.</i>

51:43.142 --> 51:45.477
If it’s ’cause of money,

51:46.478 --> 51:49.773
I have some cash set aside
my wife doesn’t know about.

51:50.440 --> 51:51.816
You can use it.

51:51.900 --> 51:55.695
You helped out a lot last year
when my mother-in-law died.

51:56.196 --> 51:58.240
Fool. Don’t say that.

52:00.242 --> 52:02.952
Do I have to beg to lend you my money?

52:03.537 --> 52:05.955
If you need to borrow, just ask.

52:06.623 --> 52:08.708
<i>Need money or not, pal?</i>

52:09.543 --> 52:11.336
I need it.

52:11.420 --> 52:12.754
<i>Fine, then.</i>

52:13.547 --> 52:14.881
<i>I’ll lend it to you.</i>

52:15.507 --> 52:17.926
I gotta go back to work.

52:29.854 --> 52:31.398
I’m going too.

52:32.065 --> 52:33.399
I’m fine.

52:33.483 --> 52:35.109
You’re not fine.

52:35.194 --> 52:37.070
You had a close call.

52:37.821 --> 52:39.655
A close call?

52:39.739 --> 52:42.867
But I have to see that bastard’s face.

52:43.452 --> 52:45.536
How can I trust you and rest here?

52:45.620 --> 52:47.414
Then I’m not going.

52:47.914 --> 52:51.166
-Are you threatening me?
-You should talk.

52:51.251 --> 52:53.420
Threatening me with the unborn baby?

52:54.128 --> 52:56.422
-What?
-My kid’s hurt.

52:56.506 --> 52:59.174
And my pregnant wife
thinks she can run around.

52:59.259 --> 53:00.927
What am I supposed to do?

53:05.098 --> 53:06.683
You came?

53:08.142 --> 53:09.478
Thank you.

53:19.195 --> 53:21.448
Didn’t eat anything, did you?

53:30.749 --> 53:32.125
You said...

53:33.335 --> 53:35.920
when I called that morning...

53:36.963 --> 53:41.134
that I knew everything
and called on purpose.

53:43.845 --> 53:46.390
That if I told even one person,

53:47.140 --> 53:49.643
you’d rip my mouth off.

53:51.060 --> 53:53.272
I guess word travels fast.

53:55.315 --> 53:57.608
I didn’t say I’d rip it off.

53:57.692 --> 53:59.903
I said I could rip it off.

54:10.830 --> 54:13.292
Trying to act strong,

54:13.833 --> 54:16.336
you couldn’t even cry, could you?

54:17.962 --> 54:20.507
You act way tougher.

54:25.679 --> 54:27.055
You--

54:28.765 --> 54:31.309
You think it’s my first time
coming here today?

54:31.393 --> 54:34.269
I came more than 10 times.

54:34.354 --> 54:36.773
I just watched from afar and left.

54:38.608 --> 54:39.776
Why?

54:41.194 --> 54:43.071
You should have come to see me.

54:44.573 --> 54:47.158
I was dying to see you.

54:48.702 --> 54:51.036
You said you’d rip my mouth!

54:51.120 --> 54:53.332
I didn’t say that.

55:08.930 --> 55:10.557
Try some food.

55:15.269 --> 55:17.814
Stop crying, girl.

55:19.941 --> 55:21.485
Is this laundry?

55:26.322 --> 55:28.992
Stop crying and eat.

55:32.078 --> 55:33.413
DEFENDANT

55:33.497 --> 55:36.499
Around 8:30 AM on July 19, the defendant

55:36.583 --> 55:41.505
dragged the eight-year-old victim
to a nearby construction site,

55:42.046 --> 55:44.048
assaulted her face and abdomen,

55:44.132 --> 55:46.175
choked her,

55:46.259 --> 55:50.889
then sexually assaulted
her genital parts. Correct?

55:54.100 --> 55:56.102
I don’t remember at all.

55:57.228 --> 56:01.024
I worked all night and came home at dawn.

56:01.691 --> 56:04.694
I drank alcohol and slept.

56:04.778 --> 56:08.448
Then, can you explain
the bloodstain on your clothes?

56:09.491 --> 56:10.909
Bloodstain?

56:11.660 --> 56:13.537
There was blood?

56:14.245 --> 56:18.541
I submit forensic results stating
the blood belonged to the victim.

56:18.625 --> 56:22.879
And video of the victim’s
identification of the culprit.

56:27.842 --> 56:29.802
VICTIM’S TESTIMONY

56:29.886 --> 56:31.220
DNA ANALYSIS

56:31.304 --> 56:35.975
The shoes and vest the prosecution claims,

56:36.476 --> 56:38.519
are they yours?

56:38.603 --> 56:43.024
Yes, but I lost them a few days ago.

56:43.817 --> 56:46.444
Where did you lose them?

56:46.528 --> 56:48.112
About three days ago,

56:48.655 --> 56:52.867
I left them at the construction site,
but they disappeared.

56:53.577 --> 56:54.952
When did you find them?

56:55.036 --> 56:58.539
They were outside my house
on the day of the arrest.

56:58.623 --> 57:03.210
Objection. The defendant just claims
to have lost and found them.

57:03.294 --> 57:05.671
There is no evidence to support that.

57:05.755 --> 57:07.673
Is there evidence to prove it?

57:07.757 --> 57:09.091
We’re searching, Your Honor.

57:09.175 --> 57:14.514
We’ll ask the construction workers
and find proof.

57:14.889 --> 57:17.391
Then present it when you find it.

57:17.476 --> 57:20.561
The next hearing will be
at 3:00 PM on September 25.

57:20.645 --> 57:22.939
Court is adjourned.

57:26.693 --> 57:28.611
You bastard!

57:28.695 --> 57:32.447
You call yourself human!

57:32.532 --> 57:36.119
After what you did to her! You bastard!

57:36.911 --> 57:38.829
You don’t remember?

57:38.913 --> 57:41.791
You son of a bitch!

57:46.045 --> 57:47.672
<i>Memorized your moves?</i>

57:47.756 --> 57:49.924
Yes, I did.

57:50.008 --> 57:51.008
Me too.

57:51.092 --> 57:52.719
But I can’t.

57:53.512 --> 57:57.890
Don’t worry.
If you miss anything, I’ll jump right in.

57:57.974 --> 57:58.891
Ready?

57:58.975 --> 58:02.937
It’s okay if you make mistakes.
Just make big moves.

58:03.021 --> 58:04.523
One at a time.

58:27.253 --> 58:28.838
Hello, everyone!

58:28.922 --> 58:30.799
I’m Kokomong.

58:31.299 --> 58:34.218
Let’s invent something great today too.

58:35.386 --> 58:39.014
Hello? I’m pretty Aromi.

58:39.098 --> 58:41.768
Why am I so beautiful?

58:45.188 --> 58:48.273
Ta-da. I’m Kero.

58:48.357 --> 58:51.319
Want to see the new dance I made?

58:55.114 --> 58:59.703
All our friends are here.
What will happen today?

59:00.203 --> 59:02.622
Let’s go to Refrigerator Land.

59:09.503 --> 59:12.715
<i>Let’s roll together</i>

59:12.799 --> 59:15.885
<i>Let’s gather together</i>

59:16.553 --> 59:19.889
<i>Kokomong is calling</i>

59:19.973 --> 59:21.390
<i>It’s time for fun</i>

59:21.474 --> 59:22.726
<i>It’ll be fun</i>

59:23.517 --> 59:26.896
<i>-Let’s roll together</i>
<i>-Hurrah</i>

59:26.980 --> 59:30.482
<i>-Let’s gather together</i>
<i>-Hurrah, hurrah</i>

59:30.567 --> 59:36.823
<i>Hold Kokomong’s hand and run like the wind</i>

59:37.281 --> 59:40.785
<i>Kokomong, Kokomong</i>

59:40.869 --> 59:43.913
<i>I love Kokomong</i>

59:43.997 --> 59:47.750
<i>Today and tomorrow</i>

59:47.834 --> 59:51.253
<i>Let’s play together every day</i>

59:51.337 --> 59:54.589
<i>-Let’s roll together</i>
<i>-Hurrah</i>

59:54.674 --> 59:58.260
<i>-Let’s gather together</i>
<i>-Hurrah, hurrah</i>

59:58.344 --> 1:00:01.305
<i>Hold Kokomong’s hand and run like the wind</i>

1:00:01.389 --> 1:00:04.308
<i>Run like the wind</i>

1:00:12.191 --> 1:00:13.276
Hey.

1:00:13.777 --> 1:00:15.111
How did the trial go?

1:00:16.154 --> 1:00:18.030
There’s no result on the first day.

1:00:18.114 --> 1:00:20.950
-When’s the next trial?
-A month later.

1:00:21.034 --> 1:00:23.661
What are you doing with this on?

1:00:23.745 --> 1:00:25.038
Can’t you tell?

1:00:26.205 --> 1:00:28.082
I thought you hated that therapist.

1:00:29.125 --> 1:00:32.253
Who cares, when she’ll help my child.

1:00:37.842 --> 1:00:38.884
Young-seok’s mom.

1:00:38.968 --> 1:00:40.553
-You came?
-Yes.

1:00:41.262 --> 1:00:44.849
When you’re done drinking,
go trade with the egg.

1:00:44.933 --> 1:00:45.934
Okay.

1:00:54.358 --> 1:00:55.860
Water, please.

1:00:56.444 --> 1:00:58.529
-You came?
-Yes.

1:00:59.864 --> 1:01:01.156
You too?

1:01:01.240 --> 1:01:02.951
Yes.

1:01:03.868 --> 1:01:06.412
I spent the whole day with the sisters.

1:01:06.913 --> 1:01:08.039
Sisters?

1:01:09.207 --> 1:01:10.792
Yes, sisters.

1:01:11.710 --> 1:01:16.505
Women fight easily and get close easily.

1:01:16.589 --> 1:01:18.298
I see.

1:01:18.382 --> 1:01:21.676
My role is kind of important.
I’d better go back in.

1:01:21.761 --> 1:01:23.221
-Of course.
-Bye.

1:01:41.740 --> 1:01:42.824
Aromi.

1:01:44.325 --> 1:01:45.659
Kokomong.

1:01:46.410 --> 1:01:47.871
Eat lots.

1:01:50.749 --> 1:01:56.379
Drawing pictures and compliments
won’t open up her heart.

1:01:56.796 --> 1:02:02.343
Kids relieve stress by laughing
and playing till they sweat.

1:02:03.803 --> 1:02:09.224
It’s 19,000 won an hour per costume
for two hours.

1:02:09.308 --> 1:02:12.269
You borrowed four costumes.

1:02:12.353 --> 1:02:14.313
It comes to 152,000 won.

1:02:14.397 --> 1:02:17.274
One helper costs 10,000 won per hour.

1:02:17.358 --> 1:02:19.819
So for two hours that’s 80,000 won.

1:02:19.903 --> 1:02:23.697
But since the ladies helped,
it comes to 172,000 won.

1:02:23.782 --> 1:02:25.283
Just give us 150,000 won.

1:02:26.159 --> 1:02:28.327
Why does it cost so much?

1:02:28.411 --> 1:02:30.747
It’s all for a good cause.

1:02:36.127 --> 1:02:38.337
-It’s 150,000 won.
-Right.

1:02:45.053 --> 1:02:47.054
Do you take Visa?

1:02:47.138 --> 1:02:48.890
-Visa?
-Yes.

1:02:50.433 --> 1:02:51.267
Sure.

1:02:55.188 --> 1:02:56.438
Here you are.

1:02:56.522 --> 1:03:03.404
How much is it to borrow this for the day?

1:03:04.238 --> 1:03:07.074
It’s 70,000 won for the day.

1:03:07.158 --> 1:03:10.453
For a week, it’s 350,000 won.

1:03:11.704 --> 1:03:12.913
-Well--
-Yes?

1:03:12.997 --> 1:03:18.752
Can you give a discount
or accept installments?

1:03:19.838 --> 1:03:21.547
-Installments?
-Yes.

1:03:23.382 --> 1:03:24.508
Hold on.

1:03:29.472 --> 1:03:33.350
This is kind of old.

1:03:33.434 --> 1:03:37.021
We don’t use it much.

1:03:38.982 --> 1:03:40.149
So?

1:03:45.864 --> 1:03:48.491
Just use it and give it back later.

1:03:49.575 --> 1:03:51.244
-Really?
-Yes, sir.

1:03:53.621 --> 1:03:55.039
Cheer up, sir.

1:03:55.789 --> 1:03:57.583
-Thank you.
-Sure.

1:04:01.379 --> 1:04:02.630
Thank you.

1:04:11.722 --> 1:04:13.182
My daughter

1:04:13.850 --> 1:04:16.895
experienced the same thing as Hope.

1:04:18.104 --> 1:04:21.607
When she was 16, she committed suicide.

1:04:25.361 --> 1:04:27.238
That same year,

1:04:30.699 --> 1:04:33.577
I drove my car into the river to die.

1:04:34.578 --> 1:04:35.955
As you can see,

1:04:38.332 --> 1:04:40.875
I just lost my legs.

1:04:40.960 --> 1:04:43.004
And I’m still alive like this.

1:04:46.174 --> 1:04:48.342
The man who did that to my daughter

1:04:51.470 --> 1:04:54.057
is still alive and roaming free.

1:05:00.854 --> 1:05:03.023
Can you sleep well?

1:05:03.107 --> 1:05:04.650
You don’t look good.

1:05:08.154 --> 1:05:09.780
I can’t sleep much.

1:05:12.909 --> 1:05:14.452
Five months?

1:05:15.119 --> 1:05:16.579
Six months?

1:05:18.081 --> 1:05:22.126
It’s due in November.

1:06:35.033 --> 1:06:37.576
MY FRIENDS WENT HOME

1:06:57.096 --> 1:07:00.516
REFRIGERATOR

1:07:09.900 --> 1:07:12.403
REFRIGERATOR LAND?

1:07:36.009 --> 1:07:38.387
YOU GO HOME TOO

1:07:55.904 --> 1:07:58.657
YOUR FRIENDS ARE WAITING

1:08:31.023 --> 1:08:35.444
Now that Hope is eating,
we’ll cut back on her IV.

1:09:06.267 --> 1:09:09.228
YOUR FRIENDS ARE WAITING

1:09:36.839 --> 1:09:38.006
Now.

1:09:39.508 --> 1:09:42.427
I’m going to ask some questions.

1:09:42.511 --> 1:09:44.847
And you answer, okay, Hope?

1:09:46.765 --> 1:09:48.267
Good.

1:09:48.351 --> 1:09:51.645
Let’s put one on since you answered.

1:09:57.901 --> 1:10:00.070
Want me to put one first?

1:10:04.783 --> 1:10:07.745
You’re not talking much these days?

1:10:13.959 --> 1:10:15.461
Hope?

1:10:16.629 --> 1:10:18.547
Can you talk today?

1:10:24.220 --> 1:10:27.473
Would you like to put one on?

1:10:33.562 --> 1:10:36.607
This is the night sky.

1:10:38.484 --> 1:10:42.070
When the night sky
gets filled with butterflies,

1:10:42.696 --> 1:10:46.074
Hope will be able to speak again.

1:10:46.700 --> 1:10:49.202
And sleep well again.

1:10:49.995 --> 1:10:53.332
And also be able
to solve hard math problems.

1:10:53.749 --> 1:10:56.460
Isn’t that amazing?

1:11:01.507 --> 1:11:02.925
Hope?

1:11:04.677 --> 1:11:06.970
Can you write?

1:11:15.646 --> 1:11:17.856
YES

1:11:23.236 --> 1:11:26.031
<i>Hope, what’s today’s date?</i>

1:11:27.866 --> 1:11:30.869
AUGUST 24

1:11:31.829 --> 1:11:33.456
That’s right.

1:11:34.039 --> 1:11:36.334
You must be on summer break.

1:11:43.131 --> 1:11:45.301
How many days till school starts?

1:11:52.182 --> 1:11:53.642
Three days?

1:11:55.436 --> 1:11:58.564
What do you want to do most
when school starts?

1:11:59.565 --> 1:12:02.651
Can I go to school?

1:12:02.735 --> 1:12:03.986
Of course.

1:12:10.242 --> 1:12:14.246
THAT’S A LIE

1:12:15.956 --> 1:12:18.207
<i>Why do you think it’s a lie?</i>

1:12:18.291 --> 1:12:20.586
<i>Why do you think you can’t go?</i>

1:12:22.796 --> 1:12:24.590
<i>I’m embarrassed.</i>

1:12:27.676 --> 1:12:29.177
What are you embarrassed of?

1:12:35.100 --> 1:12:39.772
WHAT HAPPENED

1:12:42.149 --> 1:12:43.859
That day?

1:12:44.276 --> 1:12:48.781
I’m not going to tell my friends.

1:12:53.494 --> 1:12:56.705
You think they know or don’t know?

1:12:56.789 --> 1:12:58.791
I think they know.

1:13:10.428 --> 1:13:11.929
Give me one.

1:13:15.849 --> 1:13:17.560
I can have it all?

1:13:18.185 --> 1:13:19.812
No changing minds.

1:13:20.438 --> 1:13:21.771
Let’s go.

1:13:21.855 --> 1:13:23.190
See ya.

1:13:26.860 --> 1:13:31.198
<i>Where will you say you went</i>
<i>when you were away?</i>

1:13:32.491 --> 1:13:34.451
<i>I thought</i>

1:13:34.535 --> 1:13:38.455
<i>I’ll say I went to my cousin’s</i>
<i>with my parents.</i>

1:13:38.539 --> 1:13:41.249
<i>Or went on a trip.</i>

1:13:42.793 --> 1:13:48.131
If I don’t explain well,
bad rumors could start.

1:14:05.190 --> 1:14:08.234
CLASSROOM RULES

1:14:08.318 --> 1:14:13.699
<i>What didn’t you like most</i>
<i>about being sick?</i>

1:14:15.325 --> 1:14:17.495
Missing school.

1:14:18.912 --> 1:14:23.125
And my parents being unable to go to work.

1:14:24.460 --> 1:14:26.462
<i>Spending lots of money.</i>

1:14:36.889 --> 1:14:39.975
HOW TO TALK WITH YOUR DAUGHTER

1:14:43.562 --> 1:14:47.566
<i>The man asked me to share my umbrella.</i>

1:14:49.192 --> 1:14:53.280
I thought of just leaving.

1:14:55.866 --> 1:15:01.163
But he was all wet in the rain
and I should share.

1:15:02.247 --> 1:15:04.249
So I did.

1:15:05.000 --> 1:15:10.213
People say it’s my fault
and nobody praised me for sharing.

1:15:15.553 --> 1:15:16.720
Oh, my.

1:15:16.804 --> 1:15:18.012
COLLECTION BOX

1:15:18.096 --> 1:15:19.013
Good job.

1:15:19.097 --> 1:15:21.266
I’m beat.

1:15:21.684 --> 1:15:22.768
Give it to me.

1:15:24.520 --> 1:15:26.564
-Just 10,000 won, please.
-Okay.

1:15:32.110 --> 1:15:38.534
What do you want to do most
when you leave the hospital?

1:15:40.661 --> 1:15:44.122
Go to school and meet my friends.

1:15:45.082 --> 1:15:47.125
And see the baby being born.

1:15:48.711 --> 1:15:52.464
But I won’t be able to go to school...

1:15:53.882 --> 1:15:58.220
and I’m worried my homework isn’t done.

1:16:02.600 --> 1:16:06.770
When the baby’s born, I want to hold it.

1:16:08.438 --> 1:16:10.398
But with this on,

1:16:11.483 --> 1:16:17.530
I’m worried I’ll get
dirty stuff all over the baby.

1:16:20.492 --> 1:16:23.577
<i>What if the baby is so cute,</i>

1:16:23.662 --> 1:16:29.501
<i>my parents only love the baby?</i>

1:16:30.377 --> 1:16:33.171
I’M SLEEPING. COME AGAIN.

1:16:54.567 --> 1:16:57.613
It’s Kokomong!

1:17:05.704 --> 1:17:09.833
Ever have a thought like this?

1:17:11.835 --> 1:17:17.633
Hoping things will be like
before when you wake up.

1:17:19.885 --> 1:17:23.304
Yesterday, I thought that.

1:17:23.388 --> 1:17:28.476
<i>I felt like things will go back to normal</i>
<i>when I wake up.</i>

1:17:31.855 --> 1:17:34.900
<i>So I took all my pills.</i>

1:17:36.359 --> 1:17:39.697
And prayed before going to bed.

1:17:41.406 --> 1:17:45.661
But when I woke up, nothing changed.

1:17:54.795 --> 1:17:57.923
How do you feel then, Hope?

1:18:00.342 --> 1:18:06.139
Granny used to say when she’s frustrated,

1:18:07.307 --> 1:18:12.730
“I’m gonna die.”

1:18:14.732 --> 1:18:20.195
But now I think I know what she meant.

1:18:23.490 --> 1:18:27.827
“I’m gonna die.”

1:18:27.911 --> 1:18:29.788
What do you think it means?

1:18:35.168 --> 1:18:37.587
Why was I born?

1:19:10.412 --> 1:19:12.914
Look, Hope. Isn’t it pretty?

1:19:12.998 --> 1:19:14.332
Blow it out.

1:19:19.004 --> 1:19:20.004
HAPPY GOING HOME.

1:19:20.088 --> 1:19:22.674
-Congratulations, Hope.
-Thank you.

1:19:26.136 --> 1:19:31.599
We haven’t been home so long, I’m nervous.

1:19:32.267 --> 1:19:33.601
Are you?

1:19:37.230 --> 1:19:40.942
Can’t we stay here?

1:19:41.026 --> 1:19:42.820
Why?

1:19:43.361 --> 1:19:46.531
Worried about going home?

1:19:54.039 --> 1:19:55.539
Ready?

1:19:55.623 --> 1:19:56.875
Finished paying?

1:19:57.835 --> 1:20:01.671
Gwang-sik lent me his car. Let’s go.

1:20:03.590 --> 1:20:05.133
Hope?

1:20:05.217 --> 1:20:08.470
Wanna go down with Daddy?

1:20:17.855 --> 1:20:19.439
I’ll go first.

1:20:50.303 --> 1:20:51.763
DANGER

1:20:57.185 --> 1:20:59.771
What’s wrong? Are you carsick?

1:21:00.730 --> 1:21:04.442
We’re almost home. Okay?

1:21:05.568 --> 1:21:07.570
It’s okay, Hope.

1:21:16.955 --> 1:21:18.331
We’re here.

1:21:21.251 --> 1:21:23.044
Take her in. Hurry.

1:21:23.128 --> 1:21:24.880
Hope, let’s go in.

1:21:25.213 --> 1:21:27.007
That’s good.

1:21:30.593 --> 1:21:32.345
It’s okay, Hope.

1:21:33.972 --> 1:21:35.891
It’s all right, Hope.

1:21:38.060 --> 1:21:38.892
Hurry in.

1:21:38.977 --> 1:21:42.355
Let’s go. We’re home.

1:21:43.690 --> 1:21:46.443
It’s okay. We’re home.

1:21:53.700 --> 1:21:56.161
TO HOPE

1:22:48.338 --> 1:22:50.631
Young-seok, did you come to see Hope?

1:22:50.715 --> 1:22:53.967
Did Hope come home?

1:22:54.052 --> 1:22:55.345
Sure.

1:22:56.013 --> 1:22:57.180
Wanna see her?

1:22:57.264 --> 1:23:03.019
No, I was just passing by and wondered...

1:23:03.103 --> 1:23:09.359
I heard you won’t play with her
’cause she said your face is too big.

1:23:09.942 --> 1:23:11.319
Aw, man.

1:23:11.403 --> 1:23:13.863
Who says rumors like that?

1:23:15.698 --> 1:23:17.784
Hope’s mom told me.

1:23:18.451 --> 1:23:21.329
I’m going crazy.

1:23:21.746 --> 1:23:22.830
Why?

1:23:25.875 --> 1:23:27.835
What’s the matter?

1:23:29.254 --> 1:23:34.759
I came to walk to school
with her that day.

1:23:36.303 --> 1:23:38.388
If we went together,

1:23:39.806 --> 1:23:43.101
nothing would have happened.

1:23:50.108 --> 1:23:52.860
What’s with you, boy?

1:23:53.570 --> 1:23:56.656
It’s okay. Don’t cry.

1:23:58.116 --> 1:23:59.867
It’s all right.

1:24:01.078 --> 1:24:02.954
Want some candy?

1:24:05.165 --> 1:24:07.167
Let’s go inside.

1:24:09.461 --> 1:24:12.339
“Greet teachers respectfully.

1:24:12.797 --> 1:24:15.258
Don’t run in the hallways.

1:24:18.803 --> 1:24:22.515
Book report due tomorrow.

1:24:23.933 --> 1:24:27.145
Bring consent forms
for extracurricular activities.”

1:24:28.855 --> 1:24:31.149
I can take her there.

1:24:31.233 --> 1:24:34.527
<i>The baby’s about to pop out.</i>
<i>I’ll take her.</i>

1:24:34.611 --> 1:24:36.196
Let’s put this on.

1:24:36.821 --> 1:24:37.905
Good.

1:24:37.989 --> 1:24:39.782
It’s not that far.

1:24:39.866 --> 1:24:42.160
<i>Mom, I wanna go with Hope.</i>

1:24:43.370 --> 1:24:44.829
<i>Hear that?</i>

1:24:45.580 --> 1:24:47.039
Heard that?

1:24:49.626 --> 1:24:50.918
Okay, then.

1:24:51.002 --> 1:24:53.045
We’re all dressed and ready.

1:24:53.713 --> 1:24:55.673
That’s a good girl.

1:24:56.383 --> 1:24:59.092
We’re all set.

1:24:59.177 --> 1:25:03.306
Mommy, the crackling sound is too loud.

1:25:03.390 --> 1:25:05.808
Are you worried about that?

1:26:24.637 --> 1:26:28.682
If the colostomy bag
ever falls off or leaks,

1:26:28.766 --> 1:26:30.058
please call me.

1:26:30.142 --> 1:26:31.184
Of course.

1:26:31.269 --> 1:26:37.567
And can she avoid
direct contact with male teachers?

1:26:39.694 --> 1:26:41.862
I’m sorry for the inconvenience.

1:26:41.946 --> 1:26:46.451
The teachers will take caution.
Don’t worry.

1:26:47.034 --> 1:26:51.789
Do you think the children will make fun?

1:26:52.290 --> 1:26:57.462
With you doing all this,
they’ll all be good too.

1:26:58.087 --> 1:27:03.301
I’ll come dressed more suitably next time.

1:27:06.554 --> 1:27:07.764
So sorry.

1:27:10.642 --> 1:27:11.809
Take care.

1:27:12.977 --> 1:27:14.396
I’ll be going.

1:27:51.015 --> 1:27:53.183
What if the bad man comes again?

1:27:53.268 --> 1:27:55.437
I’m scared. I hope he gets punished.

1:28:16.666 --> 1:28:19.460
Isn’t today your day off?

1:28:19.544 --> 1:28:20.545
Oh, no.

1:28:22.464 --> 1:28:24.048
Hope didn’t go to school?

1:28:24.757 --> 1:28:28.428
Didn’t I tell you?
We’re seeing the therapist today.

1:28:29.304 --> 1:28:30.597
Oh, right.

1:28:46.195 --> 1:28:47.780
Hang in there.

1:28:48.531 --> 1:28:51.951
She says Hope is getting a lot better.

1:28:53.202 --> 1:28:54.662
I’m okay.

1:28:58.541 --> 1:29:01.043
<i>How is Hope’s father doing?</i>

1:29:01.836 --> 1:29:05.131
He leaves before Hope gets up.

1:29:06.716 --> 1:29:10.887
I feel so sorry for him.

1:29:11.346 --> 1:29:13.847
Worrying about him,

1:29:13.931 --> 1:29:16.017
you’ve gotten a lot better.

1:29:21.773 --> 1:29:23.691
Of all the kids in the world,

1:29:24.901 --> 1:29:28.112
why’d this happen to our little girl?

1:29:31.073 --> 1:29:35.119
I wish the same thing happens
to all the kids in the world.

1:29:37.372 --> 1:29:42.168
Then Hope wouldn’t stand out
and be in pain more.

1:29:44.712 --> 1:29:46.088
And?

1:29:48.007 --> 1:29:50.301
But after thinking like that,

1:29:52.178 --> 1:29:54.472
I’d feel sorry for the baby.

1:29:59.226 --> 1:30:04.190
This happened to Hope
because I’m so evil to the bone.

1:30:07.569 --> 1:30:09.153
I think.

1:30:14.701 --> 1:30:17.662
Whenever I clean her colostomy bag,

1:30:22.291 --> 1:30:25.044
I wonder when it’ll be over.

1:30:30.925 --> 1:30:33.052
Did her grandmother live with you?

1:30:36.097 --> 1:30:37.264
Yes.

1:30:37.849 --> 1:30:42.019
My mom lived with us
till she died last year.

1:30:42.812 --> 1:30:47.609
She used to say,
“I’m gonna die” all the time?

1:30:49.527 --> 1:30:51.195
How did you know?

1:30:51.613 --> 1:30:56.324
She said that when she moved
because of her arthritis.

1:30:56.408 --> 1:30:59.621
When I asked Hope
what she thought that meant,

1:31:00.872 --> 1:31:02.790
she thought for a while

1:31:04.166 --> 1:31:09.631
and said it meant, “Why was I born?”

1:31:24.061 --> 1:31:25.772
Hi, Young-seok.

1:31:28.566 --> 1:31:34.321
Hope can’t walk fast,
so you go a step behind her, okay?

1:31:34.405 --> 1:31:36.198
-Okay.
-Good.

1:31:37.033 --> 1:31:40.035
I can go by myself.

1:31:40.119 --> 1:31:43.831
I’ll walk behind you.

1:31:44.791 --> 1:31:47.375
Don’t come near me.

1:31:47.459 --> 1:31:49.420
Fine. Go first.

1:31:50.880 --> 1:31:52.298
See you later.

1:31:53.257 --> 1:31:54.842
Thanks, Young-seok.

1:32:03.851 --> 1:32:06.979
Where are you off to again?
You should eat lunch.

1:32:07.063 --> 1:32:08.271
I’ll be back.

1:32:08.355 --> 1:32:10.692
-Where are you going?
-Somewhere.

1:33:06.122 --> 1:33:07.414
Hope?

1:33:08.415 --> 1:33:10.417
What’s inside that bag?

1:33:10.501 --> 1:33:12.378
Why do you want to know?

1:33:17.759 --> 1:33:19.843
Want some candy?

1:33:19.927 --> 1:33:21.512
-Yes.
-Me too.

1:33:26.225 --> 1:33:29.519
I gotta go home. Bye.

1:33:29.603 --> 1:33:31.022
See you tomorrow.

1:34:03.387 --> 1:34:04.596
Hope!

1:34:07.809 --> 1:34:11.395
The Kokomong over there,

1:34:11.979 --> 1:34:14.440
is that your new friend?

1:34:19.111 --> 1:34:22.198
Is it a boy or a girl?

1:34:37.004 --> 1:34:41.133
I have no idea.

1:34:41.217 --> 1:34:44.011
Kokomong is just Kokomong.

1:34:46.138 --> 1:34:47.514
Hope?

1:34:48.891 --> 1:34:52.436
I just want to say, don’t be sick.

1:34:55.439 --> 1:34:59.944
Sorry about before.

1:35:04.323 --> 1:35:06.242
We’re still friends, right?

1:35:08.285 --> 1:35:09.119
Yup.

1:35:09.203 --> 1:35:11.080
See you tomorrow.

1:35:18.462 --> 1:35:19.881
Kokomong!

1:35:38.024 --> 1:35:39.608
You--

1:35:49.618 --> 1:35:50.995
Are you

1:35:54.706 --> 1:35:56.250
Daddy?

1:35:59.711 --> 1:36:01.380
You’re Daddy, right?

1:36:06.302 --> 1:36:08.262
Answer me.

1:36:18.480 --> 1:36:20.274
Because of me--

1:36:21.192 --> 1:36:27.739
Are you not talking
because I wasn’t talking to you?

1:36:36.665 --> 1:36:38.625
Aren’t you hot?

1:36:48.010 --> 1:36:49.428
Let’s go home.

1:37:09.448 --> 1:37:13.160
-I’m home.
-Hi, Hope.

1:37:13.244 --> 1:37:14.453
Oh, my!

1:37:16.497 --> 1:37:17.915
What’s this?

1:37:18.290 --> 1:37:19.833
It’s Daddy.

1:37:25.506 --> 1:37:28.759
What the heck!
What are you doing in there?

1:38:07.381 --> 1:38:10.384
Mr. Im Dong-hoon?

1:38:11.427 --> 1:38:12.929
Registered mail.

1:38:22.146 --> 1:38:25.023
SUBPOENA FOR IM HOPE

1:38:25.107 --> 1:38:29.569
Why does Hope have to
go to court to testify?

1:38:29.653 --> 1:38:34.575
The Defense submitted Hope’s
psychological records as evidence.

1:38:35.701 --> 1:38:40.747
The judge said her testimony
video is not reliable.

1:38:41.457 --> 1:38:45.460
It’s going to kill her.

1:38:45.544 --> 1:38:50.674
Still, if she doesn’t testify now,
things could get worse.

1:38:52.718 --> 1:38:58.598
The sly bastard is claiming
physical and mental weakness.

1:38:58.682 --> 1:39:00.308
What?

1:39:00.392 --> 1:39:04.646
He wrote petitions saying
he can’t remember when he’s drunk.

1:39:05.772 --> 1:39:07.983
If that gets recognized,

1:39:08.067 --> 1:39:12.279
he’ll get 15 years maximum
or get off in just eight or nine years.

1:39:15.157 --> 1:39:16.908
Think it over, sir.

1:39:16.993 --> 1:39:22.664
If Hope testifies before the judge,
he’ll be cornered.

1:39:30.214 --> 1:39:33.467
CORRECTIONAL CENTER

1:39:39.348 --> 1:39:40.891
<i>You sent</i>

1:39:41.517 --> 1:39:43.602
three petitions?

1:39:45.021 --> 1:39:46.729
Yes.

1:39:46.813 --> 1:39:49.066
I don’t remember it.

1:39:50.151 --> 1:39:51.651
I’m frustrated too.

1:39:51.735 --> 1:39:53.404
After what you did,

1:39:54.446 --> 1:39:56.823
how can you not remember?

1:39:57.991 --> 1:40:01.703
Whenever I drink, I can’t remember.

1:40:03.164 --> 1:40:07.751
They force me to remember,
so my head hurts.

1:40:08.335 --> 1:40:09.878
Your head hurts?

1:40:12.756 --> 1:40:16.218
If I really did that, I deserve to die.

1:40:17.969 --> 1:40:23.184
Doing that to a kid can’t be human,
but an animal.

1:40:30.774 --> 1:40:33.777
Did you come to settle?

1:40:42.453 --> 1:40:43.620
Settle?

1:40:44.955 --> 1:40:48.417
I would love to be able to settle.

1:40:49.210 --> 1:40:52.171
But I don’t have anything.

1:40:53.380 --> 1:40:56.967
If I get out soon, maybe I can make money.

1:40:58.802 --> 1:41:01.638
You know what I mean?

1:41:05.601 --> 1:41:07.228
You went there.

1:41:07.978 --> 1:41:09.854
You remember.

1:41:09.938 --> 1:41:12.064
You know my daughter.

1:41:12.149 --> 1:41:14.151
Think I’d let you walk, bastard?

1:41:17.779 --> 1:41:19.240
Please be polite to me.

1:41:22.201 --> 1:41:24.870
Wondered why she was so cheeky.

1:41:25.704 --> 1:41:28.081
Guess she takes after Daddy.

1:41:29.082 --> 1:41:31.668
Think wisely.

1:41:33.337 --> 1:41:36.173
How long do you think I’d be in here?

1:41:38.217 --> 1:41:39.926
I’ll get out someday.

1:41:42.638 --> 1:41:43.846
So what!

1:41:43.930 --> 1:41:45.516
What will you do?

1:41:49.228 --> 1:41:51.103
Come out, you bastard!

1:41:51.188 --> 1:41:52.523
Come here.

1:42:21.092 --> 1:42:23.094
My wife said

1:42:23.804 --> 1:42:28.850
she wished the same thing
happened to all the kids.

1:42:30.977 --> 1:42:35.106
I thought that was really bad of her.

1:42:38.026 --> 1:42:39.736
But now I think that.

1:42:42.948 --> 1:42:44.783
I know how you feel.

1:42:45.701 --> 1:42:48.745
You can’t. You didn’t go through it.

1:42:49.288 --> 1:42:50.622
Dong-hoon?

1:42:51.373 --> 1:42:53.459
Can you think differently?

1:42:54.668 --> 1:42:56.837
That it was an accident?

1:42:58.004 --> 1:43:03.926
Like she was walking one day
and got hit by a car.

1:43:04.010 --> 1:43:05.304
An accident.

1:43:05.637 --> 1:43:06.805
What?

1:43:07.514 --> 1:43:08.515
An accident?

1:43:08.599 --> 1:43:13.687
Think of it that way
so your family can move on.

1:43:16.357 --> 1:43:17.774
Stop the car.

1:43:18.359 --> 1:43:19.401
Dong-hoon?

1:43:19.485 --> 1:43:20.611
Stop the car.

1:43:21.612 --> 1:43:22.779
Man--

1:43:30.746 --> 1:43:34.291
If it was your kid,
can you call it an accident?

1:43:35.709 --> 1:43:37.628
I need to walk.

1:43:52.726 --> 1:43:54.853
By chance,

1:43:56.272 --> 1:43:58.440
did you take insurance on me?

1:43:58.524 --> 1:43:59.983
What insurance?

1:44:00.609 --> 1:44:02.152
Life insurance?

1:44:02.986 --> 1:44:04.446
Something like that.

1:44:05.739 --> 1:44:08.367
I have no intention
and no money for insurance.

1:44:08.950 --> 1:44:11.953
I’ll work you like a dog forever.

1:44:12.037 --> 1:44:14.665
In 10 years, how old will Hope be?

1:44:17.042 --> 1:44:18.168
Why?

1:44:23.715 --> 1:44:26.635
The bastard could get out
in eight or nine years.

1:44:27.260 --> 1:44:29.261
That’s insane.

1:44:29.346 --> 1:44:32.308
Hope won’t even be 20.

1:44:36.144 --> 1:44:39.565
If the trial goes wrong,

1:44:41.942 --> 1:44:44.528
I’ll deal with him on my own.

1:44:45.904 --> 1:44:49.115
You’ll kill him or something?

1:44:49.199 --> 1:44:51.868
Why not? I could.

1:45:02.212 --> 1:45:07.717
Since the Defense motioned against
the victim’s video testimony,

1:45:07.801 --> 1:45:10.136
I call Im Hope to the stand.

1:45:22.649 --> 1:45:23.900
Hope?

1:45:24.401 --> 1:45:26.069
Do you know why you’re here?

1:45:29.114 --> 1:45:30.824
Why did you come?

1:45:32.283 --> 1:45:35.537
To punish the bad man.

1:45:37.373 --> 1:45:41.710
Do you remember taking the video
with the police in the hospital?

1:45:44.337 --> 1:45:45.505
Yes.

1:45:45.589 --> 1:45:48.340
You must’ve been in a lot of pain then.

1:45:48.425 --> 1:45:49.634
Yes.

1:45:49.718 --> 1:45:51.678
But you still remembered?

1:45:51.762 --> 1:45:52.679
Yes.

1:45:53.889 --> 1:45:58.018
You saw pictures
and pointed out the bad man.

1:46:02.272 --> 1:46:04.525
Could you do that again?

1:46:07.193 --> 1:46:10.363
Hold your hand up
when his picture comes up.

1:46:11.031 --> 1:46:12.115
Yes.

1:46:42.479 --> 1:46:43.772
Hope?

1:46:45.816 --> 1:46:47.818
Is this the man?

1:46:52.823 --> 1:46:54.575
No more questions.

1:46:59.913 --> 1:47:01.414
Hope?

1:47:03.542 --> 1:47:05.585
On that day,

1:47:05.669 --> 1:47:08.672
can you tell me what the man smelled like?

1:47:11.007 --> 1:47:12.843
Did he smell like cigarettes?

1:47:16.722 --> 1:47:18.765
How about alcohol?

1:47:21.142 --> 1:47:22.478
Yes.

1:47:22.978 --> 1:47:24.020
How much?

1:47:30.777 --> 1:47:32.529
Did it smell a lot?

1:47:41.663 --> 1:47:42.706
No more questions.

1:48:14.696 --> 1:48:19.284
The defendant could not prove
losing the shoes and vest.

1:48:20.661 --> 1:48:25.540
The victim’s blood marked shoes
and vest belong to the defendant.

1:48:25.624 --> 1:48:29.377
The defendant’s fingerprints
were also found at the scene.

1:48:30.295 --> 1:48:32.255
I never went there.

1:48:33.715 --> 1:48:36.217
All the evidence points to you.

1:48:36.301 --> 1:48:41.347
<i>Although painful to recall,</i>
<i>the victim came and identified you.</i>

1:48:41.431 --> 1:48:42.849
Hope?

1:48:44.142 --> 1:48:45.017
Are you okay?

1:48:45.101 --> 1:48:48.689
<i>I ask you one last time.</i>
<i>You really can’t remember?</i>

1:48:50.065 --> 1:48:51.775
Did I really go there?

1:48:54.194 --> 1:48:55.612
Do you accept the charges?

1:48:56.196 --> 1:48:57.614
Did I do it?

1:48:58.323 --> 1:49:03.620
If I did, I deserve to die.
I’ll take due punishment.

1:49:04.120 --> 1:49:07.624
But I really don’t remember anything.

1:49:09.542 --> 1:49:16.466
I submit evidence of
the defendant’s alcohol addiction.

1:49:25.851 --> 1:49:28.770
Defendant, make your final statement.

1:49:31.231 --> 1:49:36.444
I really don’t remember anything.
I’m innocent.

1:49:39.530 --> 1:49:41.324
Are you finished?

1:49:41.867 --> 1:49:43.200
No, sir.

1:49:43.284 --> 1:49:48.081
Your Honor, I didn’t do it.
I was too drunk.

1:49:49.082 --> 1:49:51.167
I don’t remember anything.

1:49:51.251 --> 1:49:53.169
It’s possible I didn’t do it!

1:49:54.337 --> 1:49:56.088
I’m innocent.

1:49:56.172 --> 1:49:58.842
I’m wrongfully charged.

1:50:02.929 --> 1:50:09.477
Sexual assault case 2012-211.
I’ve reached a verdict.

1:50:15.942 --> 1:50:18.194
Defendant Choi Jong-sool

1:50:19.821 --> 1:50:23.324
brutally assaulted an eight-year-old.

1:50:24.242 --> 1:50:26.703
Then choked her and raped her.

1:50:27.412 --> 1:50:31.124
The assault is ruthless
to the point of torturing.

1:50:32.042 --> 1:50:34.085
<i>Resulting from this,</i>

1:50:34.169 --> 1:50:39.590
<i>the victim has been wounded</i>
<i>with a permanent disability.</i>

1:50:40.633 --> 1:50:45.013
<i>He is responsible for scarring</i>
<i>the victim and family for life.</i>

1:50:45.513 --> 1:50:51.728
Also having a past record of abuse,
he must be punished severely.

1:50:51.812 --> 1:50:53.520
That’s right.

1:50:53.604 --> 1:50:54.731
However,

1:50:55.481 --> 1:50:57.693
<i>the defendant was intoxicated,</i>

1:50:58.318 --> 1:51:01.487
and his impaired state is recognized.

1:51:04.866 --> 1:51:06.492
To the defendant Choi,

1:51:07.452 --> 1:51:12.040
under the Act on Special Cases
concerning sexual assault, Article 9,

1:51:13.750 --> 1:51:15.501
Article 7

1:51:16.461 --> 1:51:18.296
and Article 14,

1:51:20.048 --> 1:51:22.174
he is sentenced to 12 years.

1:51:22.258 --> 1:51:23.760
Just 12 years.

1:51:27.180 --> 1:51:33.436
Information on the defendant
will be made public for five years.

1:51:34.896 --> 1:51:39.025
And the request for the victim’s
compensation is overruled.

1:51:39.109 --> 1:51:42.112
<i>How can this happen?</i>

1:51:43.571 --> 1:51:44.948
Wait!

1:51:47.033 --> 1:51:49.786
Why go easy on him because he’s drunk?

1:51:49.870 --> 1:51:52.163
Then drunk driving shouldn’t be charged!

1:51:52.247 --> 1:51:57.085
Drunk driving is wrong,
but you go easy on almost killing a kid!

1:52:00.338 --> 1:52:02.298
You call this a trial?

1:52:03.967 --> 1:52:05.802
A child almost died.

1:52:07.012 --> 1:52:08.721
And she’s our child.

1:52:10.473 --> 1:52:13.309
I’m here and her dad’s here.

1:52:14.895 --> 1:52:16.771
And the one responsible is here.

1:52:16.855 --> 1:52:19.190
There’s evidence too.

1:52:21.026 --> 1:52:23.277
But just 12 years?

1:52:23.361 --> 1:52:24.570
Order.

1:52:24.654 --> 1:52:31.369
You know how old she’ll be
in just 12 years?

1:52:50.889 --> 1:52:52.348
Daddy!

1:52:58.646 --> 1:53:01.357
Daddy, let’s go home.

1:53:18.708 --> 1:53:21.336
Let’s go home, please?

1:53:23.296 --> 1:53:25.673
Let’s go home.

1:53:27.342 --> 1:53:28.718
Damn.

1:53:42.607 --> 1:53:44.234
Let’s go home.

1:53:47.153 --> 1:53:48.696
Let’s go home.

1:53:50.198 --> 1:53:51.366
Get up.

1:53:52.075 --> 1:53:53.701
Let’s go home.

1:55:48.816 --> 1:55:50.401
Here he comes.

1:55:51.236 --> 1:55:52.361
Oh, my!

1:55:52.445 --> 1:55:55.822
What a big boy!

1:55:55.906 --> 1:55:57.949
-Dad?
-Hmm?

1:55:58.034 --> 1:55:59.785
His face is big too.

1:55:59.869 --> 1:56:02.622
Men should have big heads.

1:56:05.250 --> 1:56:07.668
But not as big as yours.

1:56:08.669 --> 1:56:12.048
Looks like it’s going to be big.

1:56:13.299 --> 1:56:14.675
Who named him?

1:56:15.260 --> 1:56:19.139
I named Hope. Mi-hee named him.

1:56:19.764 --> 1:56:21.432
What is it?

1:56:21.807 --> 1:56:23.351
Happy.

1:56:24.852 --> 1:56:26.478
Im Happy?

1:56:26.562 --> 1:56:28.855
Yup. Im Happy.

1:56:28.939 --> 1:56:30.899
-Happy?
-Look here.

1:56:30.984 --> 1:56:33.319
He’s looking at us.

1:56:33.403 --> 1:56:35.738
-Isn’t he smart?
-You’re silly.

1:56:43.038 --> 1:56:46.665
The loneliest person is the kindest.
The saddest person smiles the brightest

1:56:46.749 --> 1:56:50.836
because they don’t want others
to feel the same pain.

1:56:50.920 --> 1:56:52.005
- Anonymous -

1:56:52.630 --> 1:56:56.092
<i>I felt like I needed to go home today</i>

1:56:56.759 --> 1:57:00.263
<i>and left after second period.</i>

1:57:01.597 --> 1:57:05.976
<i>My friends may think it was weird.</i>

1:57:07.770 --> 1:57:10.898
<i>What should I say on Monday?</i>

1:57:11.941 --> 1:57:14.694
<i>I’m worried about that.</i>

1:57:16.487 --> 1:57:19.657
<i>I wish I wasn’t sick.</i>

1:57:22.118 --> 1:57:24.829
Throw it to third!

1:57:25.288 --> 1:57:26.663
Get him!

1:57:26.747 --> 1:57:30.293
You worked all night? Aren’t you sleeping?

1:57:31.086 --> 1:57:32.878
I’ll watch this, then sleep.

1:57:34.172 --> 1:57:37.175
Yelling at a rerun.

1:57:38.134 --> 1:57:40.010
They’re making me tired.

1:57:48.228 --> 1:57:51.147
<i>I made an airplane today.</i>

1:57:51.731 --> 1:57:56.736
<i>I made it for my brother. It looks great.</i>

1:57:57.695 --> 1:58:03.701
<i>I’m good at making</i>
<i>and fixing things like Daddy.</i>

1:58:06.871 --> 1:58:10.416
If that fool didn’t make
an error, it’d be over.

1:58:11.292 --> 1:58:13.878
Go Lotte.

1:58:16.339 --> 1:58:18.841
Give up on Lotte.

1:58:19.217 --> 1:58:21.344
What? They’re winning.

1:58:22.095 --> 1:58:24.847
But they lost 7-8.

1:58:26.015 --> 1:58:28.268
Don’t tell me that.

1:58:29.727 --> 1:58:31.854
Do you have to tell me now?

1:58:33.398 --> 1:58:35.275
Man, I can’t sleep now.

1:58:56.587 --> 1:58:59.840
<i>You being born is a blessing.</i>

1:59:13.020 --> 1:59:16.149
<i>It’s all right</i>

1:59:18.526 --> 1:59:21.737
<i>You can stand again</i>

1:59:23.989 --> 1:59:27.202
<i>More than the past</i>

1:59:29.329 --> 1:59:33.458
<i>The future is more important</i>

1:59:34.875 --> 1:59:38.338
<i>I swallowed my tears</i>

1:59:40.298 --> 1:59:43.593
<i>Because I’m not alone</i>

1:59:45.845 --> 1:59:49.056
<i>I know that well</i>

1:59:51.267 --> 1:59:54.270
<i>I’m so thankful</i>

1:59:56.606 --> 2:00:01.819
<i>Hope. There is hope</i>

2:00:02.152 --> 2:00:06.657
<i>Never be sad again</i>

2:00:07.533 --> 2:00:15.082
<i>Trust in love that abounds</i>

2:00:18.461 --> 2:00:23.924
<i>Hope. There is hope</i>

2:00:24.008 --> 2:00:28.888
<i>Never be in pain again</i>

2:00:29.472 --> 2:00:36.604
<i>Now be happy again</i>

2:00:52.328 --> 2:00:54.955
<i>I’m scared</i>

2:00:55.039 --> 2:00:57.458
<i>I’m afraid</i>

2:00:57.792 --> 2:01:04.549
<i>But I’ll live on</i>

2:01:07.552 --> 2:01:12.640
<i>Hope. There is hope</i>

2:01:13.140 --> 2:01:17.186
<i>Never be sad again</i>

2:01:18.479 --> 2:01:25.778
<i>Trust in love that abounds</i>

2:01:29.407 --> 2:01:34.620
<i>Hope. There is hope</i>

2:01:35.037 --> 2:01:39.709
<i>Never be in pain again</i>

2:01:40.460 --> 2:01:50.636
<i>Now be happy again</i>

2:01:51.220 --> 2:01:56.266
<i>Hope. There is hope</i>

2:01:56.809 --> 2:02:00.521
<i>Never be in pain again</i>

2:02:01.230 --> 2:02:11.073
<i>Trust in love that abounds</i>

2:02:12.992 --> 2:02:18.080
<i>Hope. There is hope</i>

2:02:18.581 --> 2:02:23.293
<i>Never be in pain again</i>

2:02:24.003 --> 2:02:31.051
<i>Now be happy again</i>

2:02:34.597 --> 2:02:37.182
<i>Happy</i>
