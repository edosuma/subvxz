I'm sorry I wasn't more help.

18:18.948 --> 18:22.483
No, no, no, actually,
it was very insightful.

18:32.862 --> 18:34.996
Again, mrs. Galindo,

18:35.031 --> 18:39.734
whoever you're hiding from--
your husband, the feds--

18:39.769 --> 18:41.369
be careful.

18:41.404 --> 18:44.572
Okay? I mean, we were able
to find you, so...

18:46.042 --> 18:47.542
Okay.

18:47.577 --> 18:49.510
Oh, shit, I forgot.
One more thing.

18:49.546 --> 18:51.546
Tell me, mrs. Galindo,

18:51.581 --> 18:54.982

-Hey, how's your brother?
-He's good.

21:05.715 --> 21:07.481
-Yeah?
-Yeah.

21:07.517 --> 21:09.750
He was always so nervous
when we'd wait in visiting.

21:10.853 --> 21:13.154
Like he had butterflies
to see you.

21:13.189 --> 21:15.356
-Really?
-Yeah, he's a sweet guy.

21:15.391 --> 21:17.558
And shit, he's got good hair.

21:19.228 --> 21:21.329

21:27.770 --> 21:29.704

21:30.940 --> 21:32.606
Not too long.

21:34.077 --> 21:35.710
Okay.

21:35.745 --> 21:37.712
Well, it was great
to see you out.

21:37.747 --> 21:39.380
Good to see you.

21:40.550 --> 21:42.316
Food's in the trunk.

21:42.352 --> 21:44.018
Yeah.

21:51.794 --> 21:53.394

21:53.429 --> 21:55.262
Jay-jay:
No, I got it.

21:57.433 --> 22:00.368
Jesus, when's the last time
you changed her, jay-jay?

22:09.078 --> 22:11.045
Sorry about that.

22:11.080 --> 22:13.748
She's working crazy hours
at the plant.

22:13.783 --> 22:18.452
I tried to get on the line,
too, you know, but...

22:18.488 --> 22:21.155
They hire every fucking illegal.

22:21.190 --> 22:23.724
But me, the way I look,

22:23.760 --> 22:25.960
can't catch a fucking break.

22:28.097 --> 22:30.464
How the fuck's a man supposed
to feed his family?

22:36.506 --> 22:38.672
We got something to talk about,
you and me.

22:45.748 --> 22:47.715
Yeah.

22:47.750 --> 22:51.552
-Let's talk.
-Goddamn it, jay-jay!

22:51.587 --> 22:52.953
What have you been doing
all day?

22:52.989 --> 22:54.989
This place is a fucking mess!

22:58.594 --> 23:00.961
Yeah, things are a little, um...
Hmm.

23:02.265 --> 23:04.331
I'll reach out.

23:04.367 --> 23:06.567
You do that.

23:09.138 --> 23:11.105
Come on, andrea.

23:40.636 --> 23:42.036
what's up, cap?

24:02.158 --> 24:06.127
Exorcise your soul,
not exercise your tongue.

24:06.162 --> 24:08.562
(miguel laughs softly)

24:10.566 --> 24:12.633
I do think about your mother.

24:15.805 --> 24:17.972
I pray for her.

24:21.911 --> 24:24.678
She'd want you
to get right with him.

24:25.915 --> 24:28.782
She believed you were her...

24:31.921 --> 24:34.688
Oh, that's...

24:34.724 --> 24:36.690
(sighs)

24:36.726 --> 24:39.994
that's a lot to live up to.

24:40.029 --> 24:42.630
Shh.

24:42.665 --> 24:45.599
Well, don't worry.

24:45.635 --> 24:48.702
You have fallen
spectacularly short.

24:48.738 --> 24:52.273
Mm. (chuckles)

24:52.308 --> 24:54.875
(laughs)

24:54.911 --> 24:57.111
but you were dita's miracle.

24:59.148 --> 25:01.382
After your brother...

25:01.417 --> 25:03.984
After he passed,

25:04.020 --> 25:07.688
your father blamed her.

25:07.723 --> 25:10.057
Wouldn't touch her
to punish her.

25:10.092 --> 25:14.562
She was convinced she'd never
be able to conceive again,

25:14.597 --> 25:17.198
so she came here.

25:17.233 --> 25:19.733
My mother was here?

25:19.769 --> 25:21.769
Oh, yes,

25:21.804 --> 25:24.104
with her security detail.

25:24.140 --> 25:26.106
What did she do here?

25:27.610 --> 25:30.711
She cried, prayed.

25:33.149 --> 25:35.216
When she got home,

25:35.251 --> 25:40.421
she wrote and said
that god had answered her.

25:42.758 --> 25:45.859
She was pregnant...

25:45.895 --> 25:47.728
With you.

25:53.536 --> 25:57.338
She was always so competitive.

25:59.775 --> 26:03.944
When we were kids,
I studied ballet,

26:03.980 --> 26:07.848
so, all of a sudden,
all she wanted to do was dance.

26:09.151 --> 26:11.785
If I liked a boy,
she'd have kissed him

26:11.821 --> 26:15.289
-before I had the guts
to ask his name.
-(chuckles)

26:15.324 --> 26:18.459
so, of course,

26:18.494 --> 26:20.794
when she came to visit me,

26:20.830 --> 26:23.264
her sister, the nun,

26:23.299 --> 26:26.400
she had immaculately conceived.

26:27.903 --> 26:32.506
Yeah, I don't think science
would bear that out, but...

26:32.541 --> 26:36.010
Are you doubting the bedrock
of a belief system

26:36.045 --> 26:38.412
I've devoted
50 years of my life to?

26:38.447 --> 26:40.514
For the virgin mary, I believe,

26:40.549 --> 26:43.484
but for my mother?

26:43.519 --> 26:46.120
I'm just saying, obviously,

26:46.155 --> 26:48.922
she and my father reconciled
at some point, and...

26:52.328 --> 26:54.595
But if it's any solace,

26:54.630 --> 26:56.730
I heard
she was a terrible dancer.

26:56.766 --> 27:00.234
(laughs)
she was awful.

27:00.269 --> 27:02.803
-(laughing)
-god rest her soul.

27:06.142 --> 27:08.242
What about you?

27:10.513 --> 27:12.479
Hmm?

27:14.116 --> 27:17.618

-You don't think

28:16.779 --> 28:17.911

-Stop! Don't hurt him!

28:29.392 --> 28:31.125

28:41.504 --> 28:44.071

to bag these myself?

29:03.259 --> 29:05.359
Oh, can you double bag, please?

29:28.651 --> 29:31.618
Excuse me. You can't put food
and chemicals together.

29:41.163 --> 29:43.197
You can't put eggs
at the bottom.

that we're all here.

30:57.706 --> 30:59.706

mood last time I saw him.

Uh, how about a cigarette?

33:25.921 --> 33:28.021
Okay.

33:28.057 --> 33:31.425
So you want me to tell you

Good girl.

41:20.529 --> 41:22.495
Let's go.

41:47.455 --> 41:50.623
Older we get,
the more the past haunts.

41:55.597 --> 41:57.564
These aren't
our first dark days.

41:57.599 --> 41:59.566
The more things change,

41:59.601 --> 42:01.968
the more they stay the same.

42:02.003 --> 42:05.572
When the sons took
our california patch...

42:05.607 --> 42:09.075
They conquered by dividing us,

42:09.110 --> 42:11.010
north, south.

42:14.482 --> 42:17.050
A divided nation can't stand.

42:19.654 --> 42:22.422
And santo padre divides us.

42:22.457 --> 42:23.823
I already had this conversation
with canche.

42:23.858 --> 42:25.825
So now, have it with me,

42:25.860 --> 42:30.096
an actual peer, instead of
that ambitious fuck, ey?

42:30.131 --> 42:32.799
Have it with someone
who's actually stood by you

42:32.834 --> 42:34.901
the last four fucking decades.

42:34.936 --> 42:37.770
If you came all this way
to lobby,<i> carnal,</i>

42:37.806 --> 42:40.506
you should have stayed back
in oakland.

42:42.711 --> 42:45.878
I came to help an old friend.

42:45.914 --> 42:48.881
Help him see
what this club has lost.

42:53.321 --> 42:55.488
I gave this charter to my<i> primo.</i>

42:55.523 --> 42:58.891
(laughing):
Look what he did with it.

42:58.927 --> 43:00.994
Huh?

43:01.029 --> 43:04.664
He took a garden of eden,
and salted the fucking earth.

43:06.034 --> 43:08.067
And now santo padre
has fucked up

43:08.103 --> 43:10.870
our new pipeline
with el banquero?

43:10.905 --> 43:12.872
(scoffs)

43:14.943 --> 43:17.043
this charter needs
to be ripped out, root and stem,

43:17.078 --> 43:18.845
like the fucking weed it is.

43:33.895 --> 43:36.362
What, uh...?

43:38.266 --> 43:40.366
What happened
all those years ago?

43:53.281 --> 43:55.248
That was the right call.

43:57.719 --> 44:00.386
It was for the good of the club.

44:17.105 --> 44:19.605
That same call,<i> carnal,</i>

44:19.641 --> 44:22.008
might need to be made again.

44:31.753 --> 44:34.020
Your boy was a good mayan.

44:42.297 --> 44:44.097
(rock music playing)

44:44.132 --> 44:45.565
mm.

44:45.600 --> 44:48.301
Yo, you a bitch?

44:48.336 --> 44:51.237
Yo, I'm fucking talking, man.

44:51.272 --> 44:54.006

44:55.443 --> 44:58.010
He's talking to you, prospect.

44:58.046 --> 45:00.146
Nah, I ain't deaf.

45:00.181 --> 45:02.849
Then answer
the fucking question.

45:04.152 --> 45:05.752
Prospect!

45:06.788 --> 45:09.155
Are you a bitch?

45:10.225 --> 45:12.692
No, I ain't a bitch.

45:12.727 --> 45:14.527
He's not a bitch.

45:14.562 --> 45:17.530
So you're not like that last
santo padre prospect, huh?

45:17.565 --> 45:19.365
(stifled laughter)

45:19.401 --> 45:23.136

45:23.171 --> 45:24.737
Respect?

45:24.773 --> 45:28.441
Today's a day for soldiers,
for men.

45:28.476 --> 45:32.078
Not for fat fucking cowards
who can't handle this life.
