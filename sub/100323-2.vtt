00:03.120 --> 00:05.220
She's... in a full-time

00:05.308 --> 00:06.423

been struggling.

Ok.

I've always loved you.

00:12.669 --> 00:14.497
Prentiss: Our unsub
is Everett Lynch.

00:14.585 --> 00:16.280
He's a con man
and a murderer

who slices off the faces
of the women he seduces.

00:18.972 --> 00:19.886

00:19.974 --> 00:21.217
Having a con woman
for a mother

00:21.309 --> 00:22.701
would have instilled
the narcissism

00:22.789 --> 00:24.232

that we profiled.

Grace out of jail.

They were with us over on the
other side of the trade Plaza.

that means they ditched it.

04:04.031 --> 04:06.739
He was the mastermind.
He pushed hurst over the edge.

04:06.827 --> 04:08.644
It was just
a smokescreen

04:08.731 --> 04:10.733
to throw us off
his trail.

04:16.415 --> 04:17.954
I wouldn't have
believed me, either.

But if I had, maybe...

04:19.188 --> 04:20.438
No.

04:20.868 --> 04:22.985
There's only one person
to blame for this...

04:23.251 --> 04:24.319
Everett Lynch.

04:24.407 --> 04:26.210
He's the one
who shot JJ,

04:26.298 --> 04:29.702
and he's the one that
we'll move heaven and earth

04:29.790 --> 04:31.469
to bring to justice.

04:34.704 --> 04:37.462
JJ's got to be
ok, right?

04:38.087 --> 04:39.983
But what if she's not ok?
What if she's...

04:40.071 --> 04:41.866
JJ's strong, and she's
in good hands.

04:41.954 --> 04:43.218
Prentiss: Spence is
staying at the hospital.

04:43.305 --> 04:44.499
He's gonna keep us updated.

04:44.587 --> 04:46.743
In the meantime, the best
thing we can do for JJ

04:46.831 --> 04:49.319
is... find Everett and Grace
before they go deep underground.

04:49.407 --> 04:52.944
Ok, this is security
footage from earlier today.

04:53.032 --> 04:56.077
That is Lynch posing as Grace's
attorney Arthur Terrell.

04:56.165 --> 04:57.991
Wait, look at Grace.
She hesitates.

04:58.079 --> 04:59.719
She doesn't want to
take the weapon.

04:59.807 --> 05:00.870
But she took it.

05:00.957 --> 05:02.696
And she didn't hesitate
to slice me

05:02.784 --> 05:04.004
with that knife
back in little rock.

05:04.091 --> 05:05.881
True. She's no stranger
to violence.

05:05.969 --> 05:07.678
It could be Everett
bringing it out of her.

05:07.766 --> 05:09.921
I mean, she may feel the
need to prove herself to him.

05:10.009 --> 05:12.447
Well, he's probably gonna want
Grace to change her appearance.

05:12.534 --> 05:14.030
Well, they'll both
need to do that.

05:14.118 --> 05:15.444
Lewis:
Everett is a planner.

05:15.532 --> 05:17.522
He set this escape
in motion months ago

05:17.610 --> 05:18.844
when Grace
was arrested.

05:19.040 --> 05:21.217
And now we've
disrupted his plan,

05:21.305 --> 05:24.374
so the questions are,
how much and what will he do now?

05:24.462 --> 05:26.397
I can answer part
of that question.

05:26.485 --> 05:29.577
The car that Everett and
Grace jacked downtown

05:29.665 --> 05:31.423
was abandoned in an alley
a few miles away.

05:31.511 --> 05:33.582
There aren't any reports
of other jackings

05:33.669 --> 05:35.016
in that area since.

05:35.137 --> 05:36.268
They need a car.

05:36.356 --> 05:37.502
They must have stolen
something else.

05:37.589 --> 05:39.329
Stealing an
unoccupied vehicle

05:39.417 --> 05:40.798
could go unnoticed
for a while.

05:40.886 --> 05:42.158
That would give them
a head start.

05:42.245 --> 05:44.461
I'm betting Lynch planned
for a safe house.

05:44.549 --> 05:45.554
Agreed.

05:45.642 --> 05:48.378
Matt, Luke, look into stolen
vehicles in that area.

05:48.466 --> 05:50.163
The rest of us will
work up a geo profile

05:50.251 --> 05:51.905
based on their last
known locations.

05:52.078 --> 05:54.820
It's from Spence.
JJ's in surgery.

05:54.907 --> 05:56.332
Will's on his way
to the hospital.

05:57.621 --> 05:59.075
Will.

05:59.410 --> 06:00.783
How did this happen?

06:00.870 --> 06:02.160
Why wasn't she
wearing a vest?

06:02.248 --> 06:03.644
She was. The bullet
missed the kevlar

06:03.732 --> 06:05.418
and entered just
under her arm.

06:06.247 --> 06:07.793
Doctor told me
her heart stopped.

06:07.969 --> 06:09.536
It did, but they
brought her back.

06:10.003 --> 06:11.168
I need to see her.

06:11.256 --> 06:13.582
She's already in surgery.

06:14.897 --> 06:16.377
It's gonna be a while.

06:16.504 --> 06:18.506

06:18.594 --> 06:20.509

06:20.597 --> 06:21.895
It all right if
I wait with you?

06:21.983 --> 06:23.754
Yeah, of course.

06:23.842 --> 06:25.700
She's gonna want to
see you, too, when she...

06:25.788 --> 06:27.180
When she wakes up.

06:32.063 --> 06:33.900
What are you doing?
We're almost at the safe house.

06:33.992 --> 06:35.513
You don't get it.

06:35.600 --> 06:36.637
We can't go there now.

06:36.725 --> 06:37.994
It's only a matter
of time before the FBI

06:38.081 --> 06:39.090
are all over it.

06:39.178 --> 06:40.589
Come on, let's keep going.
We'll be long gone

06:40.676 --> 06:41.650
by the time they find it.

06:41.737 --> 06:42.832
It's too risky.

06:43.260 --> 06:44.830
Fine. So what now?

06:44.918 --> 06:46.449
We're gonna split up.

06:49.396 --> 06:50.809
No. No way.

06:50.920 --> 06:52.269
Don't be ridiculous.

06:52.473 --> 06:54.074
Staying together
is dangerous.

06:54.192 --> 06:56.432
Even with disguises,
they're gonna be looking

06:56.520 --> 06:58.317
for a daddy and daughter
traveling together.

06:58.405 --> 06:59.755
After everything I went
through to find you

06:59.842 --> 07:01.539
and reconnect,
you cannot do this to me.

07:01.626 --> 07:03.323
Do what to you?

07:03.652 --> 07:05.891
I busted you
out of jail.

07:06.262 --> 07:07.327
You're free.

07:07.567 --> 07:10.156
So... fly away,
little birdy.

07:10.243 --> 07:11.738
Fly, fly, fly.

07:12.941 --> 07:14.682
You think that's funny?

07:14.949 --> 07:19.295
Look, you go
to Mexico, ok?

07:19.383 --> 07:21.080
I'll come meet you
in a couple of months.

07:21.167 --> 07:22.354
- Months? No.
- Yeah.

07:22.442 --> 07:23.854
I've already
waited months for you,

07:23.942 --> 07:25.998
6 months, in prison.
You think that was easy?

07:26.085 --> 07:27.565
You know what...
You know what I had

07:27.653 --> 07:29.437
to do to bust you
out of that prison?

07:29.863 --> 07:30.981
Huh?

07:31.082 --> 07:32.143
You think that was easy?

07:32.231 --> 07:33.658
- You owe me.
- Ha ha ha.

07:33.745 --> 07:34.723
How do you figure?

07:34.811 --> 07:36.226
The only reason you got
away in little rock

07:36.313 --> 07:38.348
is because I let myself
get arrested.

07:38.576 --> 07:40.918
And you owe me for all
the years you stayed away.

07:43.782 --> 07:45.465
That wasn't me.

07:46.076 --> 07:47.425
That was Roberta.

07:49.059 --> 07:51.770
Please, daddy.
Let me stay.

07:52.506 --> 07:53.768
I can help.

07:54.630 --> 07:55.981
I have a plan.

08:23.452 --> 08:25.022
Yeah, this is it.

08:25.362 --> 08:27.203
They just left it out here
in the middle of nowhere.

08:27.290 --> 08:28.334
Give me something.

08:28.422 --> 08:29.685
Alvez: We found the car.

08:29.845 --> 08:31.131
Wherever they went from here,
they went on foot.

08:31.218 --> 08:32.977
So now we need to look
for their safe house.

08:33.065 --> 08:35.764
Most likely a rental
within a two-mile radius,

08:35.851 --> 08:38.375
probably rented within
the last 6 weeks or so.

08:38.462 --> 08:39.772
Airbnb tentacles
are many.

08:39.860 --> 08:41.035
I've got over
a dozen listings.

08:41.123 --> 08:42.341
We need to narrow
that down.

08:42.429 --> 08:44.169
What about Lynch aliases?

08:44.280 --> 08:45.413
Aliases.
I love you.

08:45.556 --> 08:47.460
Uh, I got something.

08:47.548 --> 08:49.077
I've got a house
in Baltimore county

08:49.165 --> 08:51.272
rented a month ago under
the name Arthur Terrell.

08:51.424 --> 08:53.632
He won't use it now that
we're onto him.

08:53.746 --> 08:56.827
But it might tell us something
about what his next moves are.

09:06.758 --> 09:08.230
Can I help you,
young lady?

09:08.318 --> 09:09.663
I really hope so, sir.

09:09.759 --> 09:11.583
I ran out of gas on
the road out there,

09:11.671 --> 09:13.398
and I was wondering if
maybe you could help me out.

09:13.485 --> 09:15.096
I only need enough to
get to the nearest station.

09:15.183 --> 09:17.124
There's one a couple of
miles from here.

09:17.280 --> 09:18.718
Well, I think I can
help with that.

09:18.806 --> 09:20.155
Got some gas out
in the shed.

09:20.276 --> 09:22.226
Woman: Roger?
Who's at the door?

09:26.700 --> 09:28.343
Come on, daddy, let's go.

09:30.634 --> 09:34.718
[Laughs]
Damn, darling.

09:35.256 --> 09:36.570
I didn't know you
had that in you.

09:36.657 --> 09:38.224
There's a lot you
Don't know about me.

09:38.461 --> 09:40.158
I told you I could help.

09:40.827 --> 09:41.917
Ahh.

09:42.999 --> 09:45.007
She's exactly your type,
isn't she?

09:45.515 --> 09:46.960
Hmm?

09:47.443 --> 09:49.662
No, it's... it's ok.
I'm ok.

09:49.750 --> 09:51.233
No, go ahead.

09:54.585 --> 09:55.983
But hurry up.

10:01.806 --> 10:03.025
Woman on PA: Triage,
pick up two.

10:03.112 --> 10:04.678
Agent Jareau's
out of surgery.

10:04.765 --> 10:05.984
Is her husband here?

10:06.071 --> 10:07.732
He is. He just stepped
out to call their kids.

10:07.819 --> 10:08.851
Is she ok?

10:08.939 --> 10:11.115
She lost a lot of blood,
but she's currently stable.

10:11.827 --> 10:13.000
Is she gonna be all right?

10:13.088 --> 10:14.688
We won't be able to
assess whether or not

10:14.775 --> 10:16.473
she sustained any
neurological damage

10:16.560 --> 10:18.327
until she regains
consciousness.

10:18.649 --> 10:20.390
Could she hear me
if I talk to her?

10:20.537 --> 10:22.038
It's unlikely.

10:26.558 --> 10:29.116
I keep going over it
in my head, and I Don't know

10:29.486 --> 10:32.835
how I didn't realize
you were missing sooner.

10:33.529 --> 10:35.357
I'm so sorry.

10:37.935 --> 10:41.852
I know things between the two of us
have been kind of weird lately...

10:43.637 --> 10:45.683
Ever since you said
you love me.

10:47.359 --> 10:49.579
You said it and I heard it,
and the thing is,

10:49.854 --> 10:52.249
I just... I...

10:52.639 --> 10:53.935
I Don't know what
to do with that.

10:54.022 --> 10:55.414
I mean, I know
why you said it.

10:55.502 --> 10:58.218
I just Don't know...
Maybe you meant it.

10:58.979 --> 11:00.807
And if you did,
what does that mean?

11:02.771 --> 11:04.771
When you didn't bring it
up after the wedding, I...

11:05.173 --> 11:08.030
I didn't either
'cause I just...

11:08.311 --> 11:10.007
I didn't know how to
talk to you about it,

11:10.095 --> 11:13.788
so instead I just
stopped talking to you.

11:13.955 --> 11:18.132
And that is not what
I meant to happen.

11:21.516 --> 11:25.647
And now, all the sudden,
none of that matters.

11:26.468 --> 11:28.858
All that matters is that...

11:30.530 --> 11:31.991
[Sniffles]

11:32.168 --> 11:33.561
Is that you wake up

11:33.788 --> 11:37.413
and that I get to have
more time with you.

11:37.909 --> 11:39.432
Ah, I guess...

11:39.581 --> 11:42.796
I can't imagine my life
without you in it.

11:47.677 --> 11:49.374
Please Don't leave me.

11:53.048 --> 11:54.875
[Exhales]

11:59.452 --> 12:00.714
[Indistinct chatter]

12:05.812 --> 12:07.843
Roger and Helen foster.

12:07.944 --> 12:09.554
Everett took Helen's face.

12:09.642 --> 12:11.101
I checked out
the safe house.

12:11.189 --> 12:12.755
It's less than
two miles from here,

12:12.843 --> 12:14.106
but they were never there.

12:14.194 --> 12:17.066
I found $75,000 and
a stash of disguises.

12:17.154 --> 12:18.808
Then that's what
happened here.

12:18.999 --> 12:20.696
You ruined his
escape plan.

12:20.783 --> 12:21.697
He's winging it now.

12:21.784 --> 12:22.640
Lewis: Yeah, he's
off his game.

12:22.728 --> 12:24.960
I mean, Lynch is as
organized as they come.

12:25.048 --> 12:27.399
He's most comfortable when
he's sticking to a plan.

12:27.577 --> 12:29.859
Plus, now they Don't have the
cash they need to go off the grid.

12:29.946 --> 12:31.643
Well, they didn't
find it here.

12:31.731 --> 12:32.976
They scavenged
what they could

12:33.064 --> 12:35.223
from Roger's wallet
and Helen's purse.

12:35.311 --> 12:36.866
But he took her face.

12:37.104 --> 12:38.366
That doesn't make sense.

12:38.453 --> 12:39.632
Why give in now

12:39.720 --> 12:42.941
when he's sublimated his
compulsion for over 6 months?

12:43.100 --> 12:45.343
He sublimated
because he had to,

12:45.756 --> 12:47.317
because he knows
you're onto him.

12:47.405 --> 12:49.798
Now he doesn't have
to hid anymore.

12:49.947 --> 12:51.993
But he should be
focused on getting away.

12:52.265 --> 12:53.522
This guy's devolving.

12:53.610 --> 12:55.786
Or it may have something
to do with the fact

12:55.874 --> 12:57.796
that he's no longer
flying solo.

12:57.884 --> 13:00.741
Before little rock,
he always worked on his own.

13:00.829 --> 13:02.296
But now he's
running with Grace.

13:02.400 --> 13:04.086
We need some insight
into the dynamics

13:04.174 --> 13:05.585
of that relationship.

13:05.673 --> 13:08.179
And I know just who
we need to talk to.

13:09.855 --> 13:11.422
[Door opens]

13:15.693 --> 13:18.086
[Door closes, locks]

13:21.366 --> 13:23.085
Well, well, well.

13:25.509 --> 13:30.452
The bau is just
a cornucopia of delicious

13:30.592 --> 13:32.999
masculine goodness,
isn't it?

13:33.405 --> 13:35.771
I heard you were
a sweet talker.

13:36.319 --> 13:37.811
Oh, did you now?

13:39.333 --> 13:41.248
Was it brown eyes?

13:42.877 --> 13:44.748
Or was it muscles
who told you that?

13:44.867 --> 13:46.507
Well, you got me there.

13:46.640 --> 13:48.554
Aw. You are...

13:49.382 --> 13:51.613
You are something
special, aren't you?

13:52.932 --> 13:54.804
Uh-huh.

13:55.356 --> 13:57.315
Silver fox.

13:57.546 --> 14:00.709
You have the experience

14:00.913 --> 14:03.146
to know how to treat
a real woman,

14:03.233 --> 14:04.726
Don't you?

14:04.827 --> 14:05.874
Oh.

14:06.647 --> 14:09.641
You know, I'd rather
talk about you, Bobbie.

14:10.764 --> 14:13.908
That's sweet of you
to say, but...

14:15.633 --> 14:18.046
I know that this
is about Everett.

14:18.944 --> 14:22.147
And I already told
those young pups

14:22.897 --> 14:24.733
everything that they
need to know.

14:24.960 --> 14:26.213
And what's that?

14:26.553 --> 14:28.819
That you'll never
catch him.

14:29.269 --> 14:33.257
Everett has Grace on
the run with him.

14:33.667 --> 14:36.473
She helped him
kill a couple

14:36.561 --> 14:38.452
out in Maryland.

14:44.710 --> 14:46.146
Grace is not like him.

14:46.320 --> 14:48.007
If she is with him, it's...

14:48.683 --> 14:50.380
It's not out of choice.

14:50.585 --> 14:52.147
She's his partner.

14:52.708 --> 14:57.101
Did you know that
she cut a federal agent?

14:57.244 --> 14:59.546
And that yesterday,

15:00.089 --> 15:02.309
she took a glock 19
from the corpse

15:02.397 --> 15:05.704
of a U.S. Marshall
while escaping custody.

15:09.101 --> 15:13.265
He says
you let her drown.

15:13.478 --> 15:17.515
He says you're the reason
his daughter died.

15:17.991 --> 15:19.921
I'm the reason that
she's alive.

15:20.136 --> 15:22.436
I'm the reason that
she's not like him.

15:22.531 --> 15:25.905
She grew up with every...

15:26.795 --> 15:28.406
Advantage.

15:28.494 --> 15:29.504
Because of you?

15:29.592 --> 15:31.594
You're damn right
because of me.

15:31.793 --> 15:34.187
You think Everett
cared about her?

15:36.838 --> 15:38.623
He has no soul.

15:40.794 --> 15:43.530
And he kills 'cause
he gets off on it,

15:44.905 --> 15:47.702
not because he has to.

15:50.121 --> 15:52.900
And I knew that if he...
If he got his hands on her

15:52.988 --> 15:56.481
that he would just use
her up and toss her away.

15:58.175 --> 16:00.265
So I made sure that
he wasn't in her life.

16:00.950 --> 16:03.223
He's in her life now.

16:03.411 --> 16:05.958
But that did not
happen on my watch.

16:06.928 --> 16:08.380
Ok.

16:08.797 --> 16:10.372
How did it happen?

16:13.213 --> 16:16.278
He should... he shouldn't
have been able to find her.

16:23.902 --> 16:25.124
Spence. Wake up.
She's awake.

16:25.212 --> 16:27.518
She wants to see you.
Come on, it's good.

16:27.606 --> 16:29.340
I'm gonna go
get the boys, man.

16:40.765 --> 16:42.332
I should have
found you sooner.

16:44.656 --> 16:46.484
You saved my life.

16:47.005 --> 16:48.790

16:49.106 --> 16:50.809
I'm glad you're here.

16:51.775 --> 16:53.301
You're my best friend.

16:53.578 --> 16:55.405
Where else would I be?

16:57.576 --> 16:59.676
I should go and let
you get some rest.

16:59.773 --> 17:02.981
No. No, not yet.

17:03.237 --> 17:04.942
[Sighs]
I've missed you.

17:05.598 --> 17:07.242
Me, too.

17:11.637 --> 17:13.253
It's my fault

17:14.938 --> 17:16.450
that things
have been weird

17:16.538 --> 17:18.018
between the two of us.

17:18.106 --> 17:19.890

we need to talk about.

17:19.978 --> 17:20.997
No, we Don't,

17:21.085 --> 17:23.276
and I shouldn't have let it
drive a wedge between us.

17:23.364 --> 17:25.208
I needed to say
something real,

17:25.296 --> 17:27.044
and that's what came out.

17:27.132 --> 17:28.568

I didn't... I never meant
to do that to you.

that secret to the grave.

But...

18:43.317 --> 18:45.315
different.

18:45.882 --> 18:48.188
I sometimes think
about that.

18:49.322 --> 18:50.517
I just want you to know

18:50.605 --> 18:52.781
that I never meant
to hurt you.

18:55.319 --> 18:57.626
I just want you
to be happy.

We think it was Grace

19:31.525 --> 19:32.965
not Everett who shot JJ.

19:33.053 --> 19:33.949
You sure?

19:34.037 --> 19:35.254
I need JJ to confirm

19:35.342 --> 19:37.247
because it's the same gun
that killed the fosters.

19:37.334 --> 19:39.716
Well, if that's true, then Grace
is just as dangerous as her father.

doing so great.

I need to go down there

as possible.

You have to go.

Is she all right?

20:33.944 --> 20:36.512
Yes, yes, she's fine,
but I think it'd be a good idea

for us to talk before
you go in and see her.

Look, I appreciate
your concern,

so glad you're here.

20:53.147 --> 20:54.845

20:59.625 --> 21:02.367
The most important thing
to understand

21:02.455 --> 21:05.043
is that she's not cured.

21:05.564 --> 21:07.215
These improvements
are temporary.

21:07.303 --> 21:10.387
Addy's right.
This is an aberration

an atypical response

this must be for you.

21:21.849 --> 21:24.145
How can we be sure
that it won't last?

21:24.239 --> 21:25.520
I can't be sure.

21:25.749 --> 21:27.621
But I have seen this before.

21:27.875 --> 21:30.559
Awakenings like this,
they can last

21:30.647 --> 21:32.388
for as little as
a few days

21:32.476 --> 21:34.347
to as much as several weeks.

21:34.870 --> 21:36.660
That part is unpredictable.

21:37.151 --> 21:40.520
The part that is predictable
is what happens next.

21:40.887 --> 21:43.996
This will be followed
by a very sudden

21:44.084 --> 21:46.870
and very steep decline
in cognitive functioning.

21:47.142 --> 21:49.387
You understand what
this means, honey?

21:50.108 --> 21:51.724
It means I'm gonna
lose you all over again.

21:51.811 --> 21:54.012
Oh, please Don't
look at it like that.

21:54.100 --> 21:55.451
How else should
I look at it?

21:55.539 --> 21:58.542
As precious time
for both of us.

22:00.313 --> 22:02.750
Roberta was Grace's
primary caretaker

22:02.884 --> 22:04.364
during her early years.

22:04.452 --> 22:06.467
And even when Roberta
went into prison,

22:06.555 --> 22:08.035
Grace didn't go to
live with Everett.

22:08.123 --> 22:10.734
Garcia: Nope.
Roberta got Grace

22:10.822 --> 22:13.107
into a super exclusive
New Hampshire boarding school,

22:13.195 --> 22:15.514
St. Peter's, on
a full scholarship.

22:15.602 --> 22:17.670
And the way she did it
was a total con job.

22:17.734 --> 22:20.740
She gave Grace a fake name,
Rachel Norton,

22:20.882 --> 22:23.248
and said her father
was deceased.

22:23.336 --> 22:24.295
Nice.

22:24.383 --> 22:26.740
Roberta was trying to get
out of a life of grifting.

22:26.828 --> 22:29.048
Yeah, but Grace didn't
fit in there.

22:29.136 --> 22:30.543
She was a total wild child.

22:30.631 --> 22:32.321
They eventually asked
her to leave,

22:32.456 --> 22:34.588
mostly because the whole,
you know, having a fake name

22:34.721 --> 22:35.826
and not having
a dead dad.

22:35.914 --> 22:37.220
That would do it.

22:37.499 --> 22:40.662
The school didn't want
the bad p.R., though,

22:40.750 --> 22:41.631
so they covered it up.

22:41.719 --> 22:44.006
Nobody knows why Grace
dropped out.

22:44.216 --> 22:46.053
So shortly after
leaving,

22:46.141 --> 22:47.396
she made contact
with Everett

22:47.484 --> 22:48.640
and joined him
down in little rock.

22:48.727 --> 22:51.251
Roberta said Everett
couldn't have found her.

22:51.339 --> 22:54.670
What she didn't count on was that Grace
might have wanted to find her father.

22:54.758 --> 22:56.997
Yeah, well, if Grace wanted
a relationship with him,

22:57.154 --> 22:59.287
she would have been willing
to do anything to get it,

22:59.375 --> 23:01.495
and that would explain
the escalation of our violence.

23:01.615 --> 23:03.047
She's trying to get
daddy's approval

23:03.135 --> 23:05.553
by showing him she's a
chip off the old block.

23:05.641 --> 23:08.928
She never fit into the world
that Roberta conned her into,

23:09.255 --> 23:12.476
but she feels an affinity
for Everett and his violence.

23:12.564 --> 23:14.000
She's leaning into it.

23:14.088 --> 23:15.318
Maybe he needs her?

23:15.428 --> 23:18.285
A lot of Grace's classmates
were one-percenters,

23:18.373 --> 23:20.259
and none of them know
why she left school.

23:20.346 --> 23:23.740
He left 75k on the table at
the safe house he abandoned.

23:23.928 --> 23:26.395
And he needs that money to go
off the grid for a long time,

23:26.482 --> 23:28.264
which means he needs
a big score.

23:28.352 --> 23:30.067
Let's look into
former classmates of Rachel's

23:30.154 --> 23:31.313
who live in the DC area.

23:31.400 --> 23:33.663
Chances are that's
their next Mark.

23:35.256 --> 23:37.867
[Indistinct chatter]

23:38.189 --> 23:39.974
I can't believe
it's really you.

23:40.061 --> 23:41.932
I know. I missed
you so much.

23:42.019 --> 23:43.282
I'm so glad you're
free today.

23:43.369 --> 23:45.771
Are you kidding?
I cleared my schedule.

23:47.024 --> 23:49.113
Do you have any idea
how much time I spent

23:49.200 --> 23:50.854
trying to find you online?

23:50.941 --> 23:52.769
Kind of went
off the grid.

23:53.396 --> 23:54.959
I was worried about you.

23:55.521 --> 23:56.686
I'm sorry, Charlotte.

23:56.773 --> 23:58.395
I didn't mean to just
leave you like that.

23:58.482 --> 23:59.764
It's just...

24:00.928 --> 24:02.343
It was my grandmother,

24:02.701 --> 24:04.303
the one who raised me.

24:04.521 --> 24:06.696
She got sick.
Cancer.

24:06.873 --> 24:08.131
Why didn't you tell me?

24:08.219 --> 24:09.787
There wasn't anything
you could do.

24:09.875 --> 24:12.592
You Don't know that.
I might have been able to help.

24:13.503 --> 24:15.303
I just needed
to take care of her.

24:16.123 --> 24:17.732
In my own way.

24:19.139 --> 24:21.102
She died last month.

24:21.818 --> 24:23.234
I'm so sorry.

24:24.596 --> 24:26.248
Are you ok?

24:26.873 --> 24:31.965
Honestly, no,
I'm not.

24:32.451 --> 24:36.232
Things have been...
Really hard.

24:36.920 --> 24:38.146
I'm not sure what
comes next.

24:38.234 --> 24:39.365
I need to get
back on track,

24:39.453 --> 24:40.763
but I can't even
make ends meet,

24:40.851 --> 24:42.802
and my grandmother's
house is in foreclosure.

24:42.890 --> 24:45.011
I Don't... I don't know
what I'm gonna do.

24:45.099 --> 24:46.649
Please.

24:47.177 --> 24:49.138
You have to let me
help you.

24:52.976 --> 24:54.255
Thank you.

24:56.450 --> 24:58.341
It's so good to see you.

25:03.518 --> 25:05.825
I'm staying at a place
not far from here.

25:07.995 --> 25:09.606
Will you come home
with me?

25:11.232 --> 25:12.560
I'd like that.

25:15.759 --> 25:18.472
Ok, I think this is it.
Charlotte Burke.

25:18.560 --> 25:20.683
She was roomies
with Grace, aka Rachel,

25:20.770 --> 25:21.662
when they were
at St. Peter's.

25:21.757 --> 25:23.896
They were super close.

25:24.880 --> 25:26.384
Oh, they were
more than roommates.

25:26.472 --> 25:27.560
They were a couple,

25:27.934 --> 25:29.131
and they were out.

25:29.219 --> 25:31.693
Makes sense that's who
Grace would reach out to.

25:31.781 --> 25:32.896
Does she have money?

25:32.984 --> 25:34.609
Oh, yeah, she's
a trust fund kid.

25:34.697 --> 25:36.220
It looks like
she took a gap year.

25:36.307 --> 25:39.485
And her dad set her up
as an executive director

25:39.572 --> 25:40.966
of a nonprofit
right here in DC.

25:41.095 --> 25:42.792
Wow. Sounds like
a daddy's girl.

25:42.879 --> 25:44.881
So who is her daddy?

25:45.161 --> 25:47.405
Allen Burke.
Hedge fund manager.

25:47.493 --> 25:49.277
[Whimpering]

25:49.364 --> 25:51.932
Ok, what I need is the
thumbprint from her right hand.

25:52.019 --> 25:53.281
[Charlotte whimpers]

25:53.375 --> 25:56.802
Shh. Shh. Shh.
Look, we can do this the nice way,

25:56.980 --> 25:59.319
which really when you think about
will only hurt for a few minutes.

25:59.406 --> 26:00.452
Or I could chop off
your hand

26:00.539 --> 26:01.553
and we can get what
we need that way.

26:01.640 --> 26:02.785
[Muffled screams]

26:02.873 --> 26:04.074
Up to you.

26:04.161 --> 26:06.903
[Muffled whimpers]

26:09.852 --> 26:11.158
Everett: Ready?

26:11.291 --> 26:12.404
[Muffled scream]

26:12.492 --> 26:13.536
Grace: Do it.

26:13.736 --> 26:16.043
[Screaming]

26:20.605 --> 26:23.956
So JJ says she
loves you.

26:24.396 --> 26:27.584
Wow. Now,
that's big.

26:27.672 --> 26:29.834
And, um, where
does that leave you?

26:30.197 --> 26:32.112
Honestly, I have no idea.

26:32.435 --> 26:34.829
She says she
sometimes thinks about

26:34.917 --> 26:36.952
what might have happened if
things had worked out differently.

26:37.039 --> 26:38.091
Sit.

26:38.747 --> 26:39.922
And what did you
say, honey?

26:40.037 --> 26:41.489
To tell you the truth,
I think about it a lot.

26:41.576 --> 26:43.061
Mm-hmm.

26:44.482 --> 26:47.543
I didn't think I'd ever get to
talk to you like this again.

26:47.631 --> 26:48.567
This is really nice.

26:48.655 --> 26:49.707
I know.

26:49.795 --> 26:51.455
And I know it's
been hard for you.

26:51.616 --> 26:55.024
Mom, your disease is not
what defines you to me.

26:55.202 --> 26:57.827
It never has
and it never will.

26:58.676 --> 27:00.159
This is precious time,

27:00.247 --> 27:04.217
and I am... so thankful
for every second.

27:04.795 --> 27:07.428
I am, too.
I am, too.

27:09.082 --> 27:12.522
You know, I never talked
much about your dad.

27:15.610 --> 27:17.395
When William left,
it wasn't because

27:17.483 --> 27:19.658
of my schizophrenia
diagnosis.

27:21.370 --> 27:24.686
You know what he said
when I was diagnosed?

27:25.061 --> 27:28.100
He said, 'Diana,
we're in this together,

27:28.362 --> 27:30.407
and I am with you
every step of the way.'

27:30.494 --> 27:31.582
I didn't know that.

27:31.669 --> 27:32.845
I know you didn't.

27:33.181 --> 27:34.834
And he meant it.

27:36.449 --> 27:39.475
But then the meds,
pfft, the meds I was on,

27:39.563 --> 27:42.848
there... were so many
and so many side effects

27:42.936 --> 27:45.014
that I stopped
taking them.

27:45.291 --> 27:47.989
And of course,
my condition got worse and worse

27:48.077 --> 27:50.384
until I finally had
to be hospitalized.

27:50.471 --> 27:51.776
And then it
happened again.

27:51.863 --> 27:53.006
And again.

27:53.103 --> 27:55.583
In the end, it was
the roller coaster,

27:55.685 --> 27:57.949
that was the part
he couldn't deal with.

28:00.481 --> 28:02.124
And the thing is,

28:03.136 --> 28:05.405
even after he was gone,

28:06.280 --> 28:09.647
I kept thinking that somehow we'd
find our way back to each other.

28:09.735 --> 28:11.309
- You loved him.
- Yes.

28:11.397 --> 28:12.870
So I waited.

28:13.059 --> 28:15.155
Year after year.

28:15.673 --> 28:18.720
And at some point,
I knew it wouldn't happen.

28:21.001 --> 28:23.395
But I never
allowed myself

28:23.678 --> 28:25.723
to even consider

28:25.810 --> 28:27.987
a relationship
with someone else.

28:28.074 --> 28:31.599
You think that's
what I'm doing,

28:31.686 --> 28:34.168
closing myself off
to possibilities

28:34.256 --> 28:35.995
because I'm waiting
for a life with JJ?

28:36.082 --> 28:37.506
I hope not.

28:41.000 --> 28:44.241
Honey, life is long,
and it's hard.

28:45.178 --> 28:46.788
And you deserve
to have someone

28:47.108 --> 28:49.008
who will share all
of it with you.

28:49.280 --> 28:50.522
All of it.

28:55.188 --> 28:57.538
Woman: Charlotte is not
answering my texts.

28:57.625 --> 28:59.319
She always texts me back.

28:59.583 --> 29:01.108
I know something's wrong.

29:01.196 --> 29:02.480
Is she in danger?

29:02.568 --> 29:03.701
We believe your
daughter has been

29:03.788 --> 29:05.256
targeted by
Grace Lynch.

29:05.344 --> 29:08.260
You might have known her
by her alias Rachel Norton.

29:08.772 --> 29:11.204
Rachel?
We met her.

29:11.397 --> 29:12.592
She was sweet.

29:12.680 --> 29:14.769
We think she sought
Charlotte out

29:14.857 --> 29:17.207
because of their relationship at St.
Peter's.

29:17.295 --> 29:18.819
You're aware
they were close?

29:18.907 --> 29:21.431
Charlotte came out to us
when she was 14 years old.

29:21.741 --> 29:24.130
We think Grace is
manipulating Charlotte

29:24.217 --> 29:25.694
as a result of that
relationship.

29:25.782 --> 29:26.870
What can we do?

29:26.958 --> 29:28.952
Grace and her father
are fugitives.

29:29.135 --> 29:30.249
They need money.

29:30.420 --> 29:32.248
And they're trying to
get it from Charlotte.

29:32.336 --> 29:35.145
We need to know about
all her liquid assets.

29:35.233 --> 29:37.936
Ok. Anything
you need.

29:39.264 --> 29:41.451
Of course, miss Burke,
I'd be more than happy

29:41.538 --> 29:43.845
to help you access
your safe deposit box.

29:43.932 --> 29:45.020
I'll need
some privacy.

29:45.107 --> 29:46.108
I understand.

29:46.195 --> 29:47.170
As you know,
you've authorized

29:47.258 --> 29:48.389
two-step authentication,

29:48.477 --> 29:50.772
so I'll just
assist with that.

[Beeping]

30:02.086 --> 30:03.348
[Door opens]

30:04.499 --> 30:06.795
Ok, I've frozen all
Charlotte's accounts.

30:06.883 --> 30:08.102
Any attempted
activity?

30:08.190 --> 30:09.974
Nope, and none in the
last 48 hours, either.

30:10.140 --> 30:12.187
Do you think we were wrong
about Charlotte being the Mark?

30:12.274 --> 30:13.797
No, she's the target.

30:13.885 --> 30:15.931
We just Don't know
about the right account.

30:16.056 --> 30:18.101
That's something her
parents Don't know about.

30:18.227 --> 30:19.663
Garcia, can you
search for that?

30:19.750 --> 30:21.665
Yeah, of course.
Something they wouldn't know about.

30:21.752 --> 30:24.905
Maybe it's something that
doesn't require IRS reporting.

30:24.993 --> 30:27.806
It may not even be a bank
or investment account.

30:34.525 --> 30:35.613
Garcia: Hey.

30:35.707 --> 30:37.023
What about a safe
deposit box?

30:37.111 --> 30:38.194
Bingo.
Where is it?

30:38.282 --> 30:40.144
Downtown DC, just a few
blocks from her apartment.

30:40.231 --> 30:42.530
Matt and Luke are
down there now.

30:53.654 --> 30:55.743
[Siren]

30:58.817 --> 31:00.166
Can I help you?

31:00.254 --> 31:02.517
We're looking for someone
posing as Charlotte Burke.

31:02.605 --> 31:04.093
Posing as her?
What do you mean?

31:04.181 --> 31:05.648
- Is she here?
- She was.

31:05.736 --> 31:07.623
She wanted access
to her safe deposit box.

31:07.711 --> 31:08.679
And you helped her
with that?

31:08.767 --> 31:10.856
It required two-step
authentication, thumbprint.

they abandoned their vehicle.

the fosters have

34:00.362 --> 34:01.573

That's why Roberta was able
to keep him away from her.

34:06.433 --> 34:07.886

She would have sought
your approval

34:16.543 --> 34:18.722
by virtue of the fact
that you're a paternal figure,

dangerous to Everett.
