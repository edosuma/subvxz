00:00.008 --> 00:01.643
<i>Previously on</i> Cloak and Dagger...

00:01.670 --> 00:03.805
It's possible I'm not over my dad

00:03.828 --> 00:05.053
the way I wish I was over my dad.

00:05.078 --> 00:06.982
Daddy!

00:07.007 --> 00:08.809
Billy didn't do anything wrong.

00:08.843 --> 00:09.878
And this cop...

00:09.911 --> 00:12.950
...just killed him.

00:12.981 --> 00:14.481
Well, that's why you have me.

00:14.515 --> 00:16.251
- I'm glad I do have you.
- Me, too.

00:17.747 --> 00:19.920
- It's so good to see you, Liam.
- You all right?

00:19.954 --> 00:21.426
I'm Andre Deschaine.

00:21.451 --> 00:24.065
- I run the outreach programs here.
- You know, someone rescued

00:24.097 --> 00:26.918
a dozen women from a human
trafficking operation?

00:26.943 --> 00:29.065
Some of them recall
a wild story of a girl

00:29.098 --> 00:31.299
who looks like an angel,

00:31.324 --> 00:33.000
a boy who moves like a shadow,

00:33.041 --> 00:35.028
took down the bad guys,
and freed all of 'em.

00:35.060 --> 00:36.624
One of those businesses

00:36.648 --> 00:38.748
is a salvage yard
near the Industrial Canal.

00:38.773 --> 00:41.041
- Stolen cars?
- No, there's ambulances.

00:41.074 --> 00:43.288
- Private ambulances.
- The other girls...

00:43.313 --> 00:45.482
- ...where are they?
- I-I don't know!

00:46.277 --> 00:48.082
Please, help me!

00:48.114 --> 00:50.885
Somebody get me out of here! Please!

00:50.918 --> 00:52.921
No... no, no, no, no, no, stop!

00:52.953 --> 00:54.621
Look at the pictures on these records.

00:54.654 --> 00:56.556
These are our missing girls.

00:56.590 --> 00:58.126
I mean, what kind of
monster needs to keep

00:58.159 --> 01:00.561
all this pain cataloged in one place?

01:02.129 --> 01:05.600
<i>I suppose the best
place to start is with a story.</i>

01:07.934 --> 01:09.266
<i>After all...</i>

01:09.291 --> 01:11.831

- Ty? Ty!

02:38.923 --> 02:40.156
Ty!

02:40.188 --> 02:42.970
- Can you hear me? Are you okay?!
- Did you get hurt?

02:48.401 --> 02:51.172
<i>So, I'd like to propose a toast...</i>

02:51.204 --> 02:52.974
to Tyrone.

02:53.006 --> 02:54.674
My best friend.

02:54.708 --> 02:57.112
My port in a storm.

02:59.012 --> 03:00.914
My hero.

03:08.721 --> 03:10.865
I can't wait to see exactly

03:10.889 --> 03:12.934
how you're gonna make
the world a better place.

03:12.959 --> 03:15.029
Hear, hear!

03:24.528 --> 03:25.963
Hey!

03:25.988 --> 03:27.574
You made it.

03:27.607 --> 03:29.176
You really think I'd miss this?

03:31.919 --> 03:34.355
Congratulations to Tyrone Johnson

03:34.381 --> 03:35.552
on officially becoming

03:35.577 --> 03:38.286
a member of the New
Orleans Police Department!

03:46.660 --> 03:48.061
Congratulations again, man.

03:48.095 --> 03:50.120
Your son worked really hard on this.

03:50.145 --> 03:51.431
Congratulations to both of us.

03:51.464 --> 03:53.233
You've been a good mentor to Ty.

03:53.267 --> 03:54.901
And not just in the academy.

03:54.935 --> 03:56.537
Both of you give me too much credit.

03:56.570 --> 03:58.573
So, now you got the big
promotion at the DA's office,

03:58.606 --> 03:59.906
you're too good to
sing with your mother?

03:59.940 --> 04:01.067
Mom, it's Ty's big day.

04:01.092 --> 04:02.476
He doesn't need us making a scene.

04:02.510 --> 04:04.911
- You talk back like that at home?
- Hell no, ma'am.

04:04.945 --> 04:06.948
This is High John the Conqueror Root.

04:06.981 --> 04:09.883
Keep this in your pocket at all
time, it'll bring you good fortune.

04:09.917 --> 04:11.388
One of the perks of having a girlfriend

04:11.412 --> 04:12.952
with a Mambo in the family.

04:25.999 --> 04:27.234
Hey, honey.

04:27.268 --> 04:29.970
Your new recital... it's <i> Giselle</i>, right?

04:30.004 --> 04:32.104
My New York counterpart is asking for me

04:32.128 --> 04:33.493
to hook him up with some tickets.

04:33.518 --> 04:34.819
"Recital"?

04:34.852 --> 04:37.055
Our daughter dances for
the New York City Ballet.

04:37.089 --> 04:39.992
- She doesn't do "recitals."
- Hey! That's not true.

04:40.025 --> 04:42.628
- I did in the third grade.
- Okay, fine.

04:42.661 --> 04:46.399
Can we hook him up with some
tickets to your... ballerin-ing?

04:46.431 --> 04:48.865
Ballerama? Dance battle?

04:48.890 --> 04:52.810
- This is what I get for marrying a nerd.
- I got you, Dad.

05:29.575 --> 05:31.043
I don't see any of those around,

Tandy, what are you talking about?

05:58.003 --> 05:59.305
It was confetti.

06:14.253 --> 06:15.654
Thought I saw you sneak out.

06:15.688 --> 06:16.680
Hey!

06:17.540 --> 06:18.936
There's the man of the hour.

06:18.961 --> 06:20.092
And look at you.

06:20.125 --> 06:21.777
Dressed up like us common folk.

06:21.802 --> 06:27.065
Oh, Evita spilled some champagne on me.

06:27.099 --> 06:30.069
- Might have had a little too much.
- I knew I liked her.

06:31.443 --> 06:33.979
Thanks again, comin' all
the way from New York.

06:34.005 --> 06:35.656
Don't even!

06:35.688 --> 06:37.554
You flew out for my
first and second shows.

06:37.579 --> 06:40.980
Of course I'm gonna come
home for your graduation.

06:42.948 --> 06:45.150
No place like it, right?

06:46.217 --> 06:47.854
Sure...

06:52.056 --> 06:56.128
- What's wrong?
- Nothing.

07:00.717 --> 07:03.868
Ma says we're low on ice,
so I was gonna go, uh...

07:03.902 --> 07:06.005
pick some up from the store.

07:06.037 --> 07:07.239
Wanna go for a walk?

07:10.414 --> 07:12.044
Come on.

07:13.887 --> 07:15.757
Y'know I'm gonna need
that back at some point, right?

07:17.153 --> 07:19.523
Sure you're ready for this?

07:19.548 --> 07:21.517
What'd do you mean?

07:21.542 --> 07:22.587
Growin' up.

07:23.888 --> 07:25.542
I mean, all you used to do was complain

07:25.567 --> 07:28.035
about living up to expectations.

07:28.260 --> 07:30.062
If you thought you had
to act perfect before...

07:30.094 --> 07:31.696
Come on.

07:31.729 --> 07:34.066
I'm not the only black
cop in the city, Tandy.

07:36.402 --> 07:37.837
Where is this coming from?

07:37.870 --> 07:41.707
I mean, I've been talkin'
about this since we were kids.

07:41.739 --> 07:44.843
Ah, I was just... thinkin'
about the day we met.

07:46.501 --> 07:49.204
Dad's car splatted
into the water, and...

07:49.229 --> 07:50.797
you were up on the docks.

07:50.822 --> 07:51.957
Yeah.

07:52.116 --> 07:54.619
Connors stopped Billy,
thinkin' he stole that radio.

07:56.053 --> 07:58.524
And I couldn't swim to shore by myself.

07:59.858 --> 08:01.809
But you saw me.

08:01.834 --> 08:04.897
Nine years old, and dove
in to save some random girl.

08:06.294 --> 08:08.356
And saved my whole family in the process.

08:08.964 --> 08:11.371
Okay, you're over-hyping it.

08:11.439 --> 08:12.974
I'm not!

08:13.006 --> 08:16.477
That crash made my folks
get their shit together.

08:16.510 --> 08:18.513
I mean, now look at 'em.

08:19.780 --> 08:23.083
You saved us, and you
still wanna keep on giving.

08:23.116 --> 08:24.986
So?

08:25.953 --> 08:27.989
So, compared to that, what
am I doin' with my life?

08:28.022 --> 08:30.792
Pfft, right... right.

08:30.825 --> 08:33.628
The prima ballerina hasn't
accomplished anything.

08:33.660 --> 08:35.363
Ha-ha!

08:49.072 --> 08:50.542
You saved me too, you know?

08:51.578 --> 08:52.747
What?

08:54.414 --> 08:56.616
You saved me, too.

08:57.244 --> 09:00.658
I always thought helping you was
the reason Connors never arrested us.

09:01.541 --> 09:05.588
So, you saved my life
by jumping in the water,

09:06.393 --> 09:08.504
and I saved yours by not drowning?

09:08.582 --> 09:10.765
It's not just that, you had my back.

09:12.357 --> 09:15.222
Who listened to me every time trying
to measure up was drivin' me nuts?

09:18.172 --> 09:19.636
One day...

09:19.661 --> 09:22.598
long ago, I saved your life, but...

09:22.743 --> 09:24.946
every day since,
you've been saving mine.

09:26.781 --> 09:29.150
Tyrone Johnson...

09:29.182 --> 09:32.016
comin' in all slick and sweet.

09:32.391 --> 09:34.524
I can't say anything nice to you.

09:41.428 --> 09:43.898
Yo, girl, wassup?

09:43.931 --> 09:46.368
I just wanted to let
you know that you're hot.

09:47.701 --> 09:49.436
And let you know that...

09:49.470 --> 09:51.071
hot girls like you...

09:51.104 --> 09:52.574
shouldn't have to settle for that.

09:54.074 --> 09:56.030
Girls like me?

09:56.543 --> 09:58.412
Like what, hmm?

09:58.446 --> 09:59.846
What am I settling for?

09:59.879 --> 10:01.715
Leave her alone, man.

10:01.749 --> 10:03.183
That's the way things are now.

10:03.216 --> 10:04.851
They'll take our women,

10:04.884 --> 10:06.840
and whine that the world's still racist.

10:06.865 --> 10:10.725
- Look, come on.
- Are you serious?!

10:10.758 --> 10:12.727
- Look, let's get out of here, come on.
- No, no, no, no.

10:12.759 --> 10:15.763
No, I want to hear the
world according to redneck.

10:17.764 --> 10:19.699
Shit... don't move, don't move!

10:21.802 --> 10:22.936
You gonna rob me, huh?

10:22.970 --> 10:25.226
- Sir, no one is trying to rob you...
- Shut up!

10:25.251 --> 10:26.741
Think you can just walk in here,
and do whatever you want?!

10:26.773 --> 10:28.743
Sir, no one is walking
in and doing anything, okay?

10:28.776 --> 10:29.978
I'm a police officer.

10:32.479 --> 10:34.181
Just let me get my badge.

10:40.186 --> 10:42.089
All right, sir...

10:42.115 --> 10:43.317
my badge is with my friend.

10:43.364 --> 10:45.233
I'm gonna need you to stay
calm so she can take it out.

10:45.258 --> 10:47.260
Can you do that, sir?

10:47.293 --> 10:48.797
Yeah.

11:02.877 --> 11:04.612
- Tandy!
- Ty, get down!

11:12.385 --> 11:14.188
Tandy...

11:15.989 --> 11:17.291
Ty...

11:17.324 --> 11:19.861
- Tandy, you okay?
- Ty, what the hell?!

11:19.893 --> 11:21.628
Was that...

11:25.428 --> 11:29.265
So, lunch for my favorite engineer

11:29.290 --> 11:30.864
is almost done.

12:00.100 --> 12:01.528
And remember,

12:01.553 --> 12:04.523
I packed your airsickness
pills if you need them.

12:04.837 --> 12:06.406
What?

12:08.199 --> 12:10.435
In four hours, you're flying out
on a helicopter

12:10.468 --> 12:11.819
to fix Roxxon's problems,

12:11.881 --> 12:15.084
do you really want to start by losing
your breakfast into Lake Borgne?

12:16.850 --> 12:19.586
I'm not fixing Roxxon's problems.

12:24.023 --> 12:25.927
We're just...

12:27.313 --> 12:29.265
We're getting some weird
reports from this rig,

12:29.290 --> 12:31.832
so Scarborough wants someone out
there looking at the operation.

12:31.864 --> 12:33.834
Well, he wouldn't be sending
you if he didn't trust you.

12:33.867 --> 12:34.999
He wouldn't be sending me

12:35.069 --> 12:37.350
if literally anybody
else wanted to do it.

12:37.375 --> 12:40.446
The supervisor there
is a raging asshole and...

12:45.383 --> 12:47.787
Honey? Don't you need to get that?

12:52.224 --> 12:54.360
Mr. Scarborough, hi, I-I was just...

12:55.795 --> 12:58.632
Yes, yes, that's fine,
absolutely, I'll be there.

13:00.124 --> 13:02.725
Looks like they
moved my departure time up.

13:06.878 --> 13:10.101
Hey... you can handle this, okay?

13:10.126 --> 13:12.795
I know you think that your
bosses don't take you seriously...

13:12.820 --> 13:14.223
They don't.

13:14.256 --> 13:16.502
Roxxon hired you because...

13:16.549 --> 13:18.284
Because you're still
friends with Dad's friends

13:18.318 --> 13:19.620
from when he used to work there.

13:19.653 --> 13:22.167
Because you finished early
and top of your class.

13:22.192 --> 13:24.692
And because whatever
it is... leaky faucet,

13:24.725 --> 13:26.051
global warming...

13:26.076 --> 13:27.416
if it needs fixing...

13:27.441 --> 13:29.630
You're cribbing from
your old propaganda, Mom.

13:29.663 --> 13:32.467
Wasn't down with them
when they were about Dad.

13:33.833 --> 13:37.604
It's been 10 years since he
moved to Silicon Valley...

13:37.638 --> 13:38.704
Can we do the whole

13:38.729 --> 13:41.265
"my abusive father's not an
asshole" thing another time?

13:41.381 --> 13:44.050
I have a lot to think about today.

13:44.478 --> 13:45.813
Fair enough.

13:46.813 --> 13:49.015
Kick some ass.

Hi, excuse me, could you
help me find the, um...

14:14.914 --> 14:17.084
Excuse me, sir, can...

14:17.211 --> 14:19.614
Yeah... great.

14:27.763 --> 14:29.273
You look lost.

14:29.298 --> 14:31.742
Uh, yeah... I'm looking
for the Machine Shop?

14:31.767 --> 14:34.160
- I thought I was supposed to turn left...
- I'll take you there.

14:34.193 --> 14:35.663
- This place is a maze.
- Thanks.

14:35.696 --> 14:37.832
I'm from the home office, Tandy Bowen.

14:37.865 --> 14:39.295
Wait, you're from corporate.

14:39.334 --> 14:41.868
Billy Johnson. My brother, Tyrone.

14:41.901 --> 14:43.850
Sorry you're here for nothing, though.

14:43.881 --> 14:46.749
- The pressure analytics were skewed.
- What pressure analytics?

14:46.774 --> 14:48.443
Hey!

14:49.576 --> 14:51.542
I don't care what Scarborough needs,

14:51.567 --> 14:53.595
I'm not having a spy on my rig.

14:53.620 --> 14:54.914
So, I'm sorry, Miss...

14:54.947 --> 14:56.583
Bowen?

14:56.616 --> 14:59.419
- As in Nathan Bowen?
- Um, yeah.

14:59.452 --> 15:01.652
Seriously, does Scarborough
think just because

15:01.677 --> 15:03.857
I used your daddy's research,
I'd let you in or something?

15:03.890 --> 15:06.183
No. Go home. Like, now.

15:06.253 --> 15:08.261
Okay, look, I-I know it must be tough

15:08.294 --> 15:09.697
being the only woman around here.

15:09.730 --> 15:10.998
I'm sure you gotta
bust some balls, but...

15:11.032 --> 15:14.135
Yeah, I'm not explaining myself
to Structural Engineering Barbie.

15:20.887 --> 15:22.784
Dr. Hess is kinda an acquired taste.

15:22.809 --> 15:24.749
How do I get to the Core Room from here?

15:24.774 --> 15:26.889
I need to take a look at those
skewed pressure analytics.

15:26.914 --> 15:28.530
I-I don't really know if Dr. Hess

15:28.582 --> 15:30.583
- would be okay...
- Spoiler alert:

15:30.616 --> 15:32.819
I'm really good at not giving a shit.

15:36.657 --> 15:39.826
So, how did you get
this plum assignment, Theo?

15:39.851 --> 15:43.063
Tyrone. My brother,
Billy, got me the job.

15:43.096 --> 15:44.624
He's been workin' here for years.

15:44.649 --> 15:46.933
So, Roxxon runs in the family, huh?

15:56.175 --> 15:57.844
Somethin' wrong?

16:00.868 --> 16:04.038
No... no, no, no, not at
all, let's... let's go.

16:08.822 --> 16:10.748
So, you were the one
who noticed the pressure?

16:10.772 --> 16:12.225
Yeah.

16:12.226 --> 16:14.928
Yeah, but Billy said it
always spikes before a kick.

16:14.962 --> 16:17.589
God forbid you don't listen to Billy.

16:17.614 --> 16:19.450
He's usually right.

16:19.503 --> 16:21.706
I mean, he made engineer
by the time he was my age.

16:21.802 --> 16:24.337
So, that's your deal, huh?

16:24.370 --> 16:25.972
Trying to prove you're as good as him?

16:26.731 --> 16:28.608
Nah, he's helpin' me out, you know?

16:29.710 --> 16:31.809
So I don't have it as tough as he did.

16:31.834 --> 16:33.047
That must be nice.

16:34.481 --> 16:38.952
Isn't your dad the,
uh... Roxxon super genius?

16:38.986 --> 16:40.788
That doesn't give you a head start?

16:40.821 --> 16:42.856
Gives me a headache, honestly.

16:43.923 --> 16:45.992
Most days, I'm not even
sure I want to be here.

16:46.025 --> 16:47.861
So, why not leave?

16:47.894 --> 16:51.398
My mom called in every favor
she had to get me this job.

16:51.431 --> 16:53.267
So, what are you saying?
You don't like this stuff?

16:54.601 --> 16:56.917
Science? Physics?

16:56.942 --> 16:59.204
I used to.

16:59.460 --> 17:01.930
I liked that it was black and white.

17:02.748 --> 17:05.561
That every question had an answer.

17:05.736 --> 17:07.003
Same here.

17:09.516 --> 17:13.387
I try to remember that every time
I think I got in over my head.

17:14.430 --> 17:17.663
There's a sense to it... right?

17:21.761 --> 17:23.128
Holy crap...

17:24.030 --> 17:25.576
These pressures...

17:25.601 --> 17:28.469
- they've been building the past month.
- Was I subtle?

17:28.555 --> 17:29.773
You're not welcome!

17:29.798 --> 17:31.504
You're putting your
whole crew in danger.

17:31.538 --> 17:32.873
Who the hell do you think you are?

17:32.905 --> 17:34.774
Look, Mina, I-I... you
gotta listen to me...

17:34.808 --> 17:36.441
Why do you keep talking
to me like you know me?

17:36.466 --> 17:37.739
What, Nathan Bowen's little princess

17:37.763 --> 17:39.245
gets to act like we're best friends?

17:39.246 --> 17:41.895
No... no, no, I-I I don't know why I...

17:41.920 --> 17:44.018
My name is Dr. Hess,
as far as you're concerned.

17:44.050 --> 17:45.919
And we've been up and down
on the pressure ladder.

17:46.953 --> 17:48.856
Dr. Hess, with all due respect,

17:48.888 --> 17:51.224
the problem is much less
the pressure, but the heat.

17:51.258 --> 17:53.874
Am I asking roustabouts for advice now?

17:53.899 --> 17:55.529
No, he's right.

17:55.561 --> 17:57.690
The heat is heading up, not spiking.

17:57.715 --> 18:00.134
And it's climbing up your
ladder, one rung at a time.

18:01.245 --> 18:02.542
We can't stop drilling.

18:02.567 --> 18:03.803
Oh, absolutely not.

18:03.837 --> 18:05.674
Because if you stop that drill,

18:05.699 --> 18:07.974
three, very bad things
are going to happen.

18:08.008 --> 18:10.310
One: Structural failure
of this whole rig.

18:10.335 --> 18:12.780
And once the legs buckle,
and the hull hits water,

18:12.812 --> 18:14.670
that's when you cause number two:

18:14.695 --> 18:16.631
A very large...

18:18.133 --> 18:19.668
Not again...

18:19.920 --> 18:21.480
Who are you?!

18:23.221 --> 18:24.656
Who is who?

18:28.714 --> 18:32.291
Um... the heat is rising.

18:33.032 --> 18:34.135
No...

18:35.978 --> 18:39.427
Something's not right.

18:51.874 --> 18:52.987
You okay?

18:55.242 --> 18:56.529
Come on.

18:56.554 --> 18:58.233
Come on, we gotta get out of here.

18:58.258 --> 19:00.827
No, no, no, we can't,
something's not right.

19:00.860 --> 19:05.031
Help, please. I can't move!

19:09.308 --> 19:10.913
Look, we have to get
off this floor, okay?

19:10.938 --> 19:13.040
These... these alarms only
go off if things are bad.

19:13.064 --> 19:15.152
- Kaboom bad.
- We need something to...

19:15.176 --> 19:16.615
to pry her out, or...

19:16.640 --> 19:18.178
Or to cut the...

19:18.990 --> 19:20.708
What the hell is that?

20:18.716 --> 20:20.251
Save the shorebirds!

20:20.346 --> 20:22.253
Sign the petition!

20:22.284 --> 20:24.110
Save the native shorebirds!

20:33.153 --> 20:34.638
Excuse me, sir.

20:34.707 --> 20:36.796
Um... did you drop this?

20:36.823 --> 20:40.159
Uh, no I-I don't... I don't think so.

20:40.193 --> 20:43.830
Oh... I-I-I thought I saw it
fall out of your back pocket.

20:44.998 --> 20:47.616
Not that I was looking
at your butt or anything.

20:47.663 --> 20:50.933
Nah, I di... I
didn't think that you were.

20:50.959 --> 20:53.094
Phew!

20:53.128 --> 20:55.130
Uh, spare a second for the shorebirds?

20:55.162 --> 20:56.765
Hon, we're late for dinner?

20:56.797 --> 20:59.267
Uh, it... it'll only take a second.

20:59.301 --> 21:02.204
Did you know that the shorebirds
have been dying off for 20 years?

21:02.237 --> 21:03.438
Wow, they have?

21:03.470 --> 21:06.307
Yeah, ever since Roxxon
Gulf moved to Pensacola.

21:06.341 --> 21:09.011
Bird erosion's a big problem.

21:09.044 --> 21:11.412
"Bird erosion"... that's a thing?

21:13.903 --> 21:15.506
Oh!

21:17.151 --> 21:18.386
Are you...

21:18.420 --> 21:20.269
- Are you all right?
- Hon, we should go.

21:20.294 --> 21:23.027
I'm so sorry, I...

21:23.324 --> 21:26.128
I've been out here all day,
trying to meet my signature quota,

21:26.161 --> 21:28.363
and I-I guess I skipped lunch.

21:28.388 --> 21:29.612
It's okay.

21:29.637 --> 21:31.508
Y'know, birds are people, too.

21:31.533 --> 21:33.237
I wish...

21:33.829 --> 21:37.033
Birds can go anywhere,
but the shorebirds, they...

21:37.113 --> 21:39.248
choose here.

21:39.272 --> 21:40.842
Someone's gotta look out for them.

I shouldn't know her name at all.

Will you shut up?!

29:26.906 --> 29:28.843
We were doing fine until you showed up!

29:28.875 --> 29:31.046
It was all your messing around
in the Core Room that led to this.

29:31.078 --> 29:32.451
That doesn't make any sense!

29:32.475 --> 29:34.475
Why do you think you're smarter
than everybody else?

29:34.500 --> 29:35.654
I mean, look at this!

29:35.679 --> 29:37.498
How many people does
Bowen's baby have to hurt

29:37.523 --> 29:39.520
- before she realize she's...
- Shut up!

29:40.969 --> 29:43.738
The alarms... the
gauges... they just spiked.

29:43.767 --> 29:45.119
It's because of you.

29:45.143 --> 29:47.023
It's because of all
of your messing around.

29:47.048 --> 29:48.251
Because of me.

29:48.322 --> 29:50.832
I don't care that you're the
daughter of the great Nathan Bowen...

29:50.864 --> 29:52.333
You keep doing that!

29:52.365 --> 29:54.474
You keep throwing my dad
in my face like you're...

29:54.499 --> 29:56.846
trying to get a rise out of
me, trying to mess with my head!

30:05.362 --> 30:07.215
Where are you?

30:07.248 --> 30:09.909
- Come on, where are you?
- Where's who?

30:09.934 --> 30:11.186
Whoever's doing this!

30:11.219 --> 30:12.987
Girl, how much did you have to drink?

30:13.019 --> 30:14.955
And what are you wearing?

30:16.356 --> 30:17.691
What's happening?

30:17.725 --> 30:19.132
What's happening? Where are you?!

30:19.157 --> 30:20.570
Tandy, why are you doing this?

30:20.595 --> 30:22.234
Why are you running
around and screaming?

30:22.259 --> 30:25.741
- Mom... Mom, this... this isn't real.
- This is Ty's big day.

30:25.766 --> 30:28.592
- Do not ruin this for him.
- Wha...

30:37.112 --> 30:40.009
- Hey! Why are you causing such a scene?
- Let go of me!

30:42.115 --> 30:43.612
No!

30:43.637 --> 30:44.744
You wanna start some trouble?

30:44.768 --> 30:46.195
Then you can start it somewhere else.

30:48.823 --> 30:50.384
I am so sick and tired

30:50.409 --> 30:51.837
of you embarrassing your mother and me.

30:51.862 --> 30:53.407
- After all we do for you!
- Shut up!

30:56.264 --> 30:57.675
What'd you just say to me?!

30:57.700 --> 31:00.067
You are just like your mother.
A useless,

31:00.101 --> 31:02.050
- good-for-nothin' drunk!
- Shut up!

31:25.903 --> 31:27.554
I wouldn't touch that.

31:30.297 --> 31:33.836
The damage that fingerprints can do.

31:36.504 --> 31:37.973
Okay...

31:40.256 --> 31:44.461
Of course. Lia... tricked me.

31:46.113 --> 31:48.016
She put me in that ambulance.

31:48.420 --> 31:50.350
But she did it for you.

31:50.383 --> 31:53.397
- Lia acts on her own accord.
- Bullshit.

31:53.720 --> 31:56.194
You knew she was messed up...

31:57.026 --> 31:58.495
and you used it, right?

32:02.511 --> 32:04.914
That's what all this is, right?

32:05.925 --> 32:08.368
Your collection of women's misery?

32:13.547 --> 32:14.955
Not misery.

32:15.308 --> 32:16.588
Despair.

32:16.684 --> 32:18.251
There's a...

32:18.401 --> 32:20.738
subtle, but distinct, difference.

32:20.851 --> 32:24.188
Technically, misery is defined
as "a source of great distress."

32:24.251 --> 32:26.210
And how do you define "despair"?

32:26.366 --> 32:28.234
"An absence of hope."

32:28.726 --> 32:30.502
I know it firsthand.

32:31.033 --> 32:33.549
The headaches got so bad...

32:33.995 --> 32:35.900
I decided to kill myself.

32:35.967 --> 32:39.070
I went to the water, and
I climbed as high as I could.

32:39.165 --> 32:40.621
It started rainin'.

32:40.688 --> 32:43.440
I climbed, I jumped...

32:43.996 --> 32:46.237
that should have been the end of it.

32:46.332 --> 32:48.355
But then something happened that night.

32:48.410 --> 32:49.844
The rig explosion.

32:49.876 --> 32:52.847
Just like that, I was alive.

32:53.275 --> 32:54.995
And the fates,

32:55.082 --> 32:56.644
as they would have it,

32:57.170 --> 32:59.519
gave me a way to make
the headaches stop.

33:00.636 --> 33:02.352
For a little bit of time.

33:13.934 --> 33:15.436
So, what?

33:16.653 --> 33:19.217
You get inside people's heads...

33:19.568 --> 33:22.005
make them feel pain, so
it can take away yours?

33:22.078 --> 33:25.515
90% of the time, the people
that come my way, I help.

33:25.614 --> 33:28.050
Give them counseling, choices,

33:28.114 --> 33:29.784
shelter.

33:31.873 --> 33:33.575
But the other 10%...

33:33.733 --> 33:35.535
they can't be helped.

33:35.867 --> 33:38.141
- So, they help me.
- You're despicable.

33:38.225 --> 33:40.297
About halfway through your bin.

33:40.725 --> 33:42.659
There's a run that
you went on last year,

33:42.763 --> 33:44.399
stealin' other people's hope...

33:44.431 --> 33:45.400
No, I would never.

33:45.425 --> 33:47.202
But, you did.

33:47.822 --> 33:49.069
Kinda, right?

33:52.006 --> 33:53.842
What're you gonna do?

34:06.854 --> 34:08.389
Don't!

34:27.943 --> 34:30.344
Brigid, no one picked up
the phone at Tandy's place.

34:32.612 --> 34:33.914
No, no... there's... there's no one

34:33.947 --> 34:35.900
matching her description
at local hospitals.

34:37.184 --> 34:39.734
No, I already wasted too
much time sitting tight.

34:56.036 --> 34:58.479
Tandy!

35:06.813 --> 35:08.608
What happened?

35:09.476 --> 35:13.021
I found out who's moving those
missing girls across the city.

35:14.974 --> 35:16.892
We need to stop him.

35:20.281 --> 35:21.898
You really think they'd come back here?

35:22.054 --> 35:23.953
Tandy said they didn't
get that big a head start.

35:24.030 --> 35:26.299
They weren't expecting me to get away.

35:26.333 --> 35:27.435
And if they were rolling out,

35:27.467 --> 35:29.270
they'd need to cover their tracks first.

35:33.007 --> 35:35.935
Sorry. I called back-up.

35:36.224 --> 35:37.900
I thought you said you were our back-up.

35:37.925 --> 35:39.141
Tandy's barely standing.

35:39.166 --> 35:41.903
The cops will handle this, I promise.

35:45.593 --> 35:46.970
Fine.

35:48.100 --> 35:50.863
Ty, look, you gotta get out of
here before the cops see you.

35:50.958 --> 35:52.218
What're you gonna do?

35:52.546 --> 35:55.312
You really think the
police can stop him?

36:03.591 --> 36:05.222
I got you.

36:14.315 --> 36:15.950
Going somewhere?

36:17.784 --> 36:20.087
- Tandy, wait...
- I don't think so.

36:20.551 --> 36:22.481
You sure?

36:24.231 --> 36:25.760
Good thing Mikayla came early

36:25.793 --> 36:27.723
for her first day back, huh?

36:27.754 --> 36:30.186
We don't want to hurt her, just...

36:45.579 --> 36:47.381
Check yourself, Mr. Johnson.

36:47.971 --> 36:49.823
You wanna shoot?

36:50.065 --> 36:51.946
Then shoot.

36:52.200 --> 36:54.835
- Tandy...
- Go ahead and pull the trigger.

36:54.954 --> 36:56.923
- Ty will clean you up.
- Tandy...

36:56.956 --> 36:58.492
Tandy, I was in your head.

36:58.525 --> 37:00.728
I know this is all an act.

37:00.760 --> 37:02.549
Now, come on... the
police are outside, you're done.

37:02.574 --> 37:05.644
You think everything bad you
felt in there came from me?

37:05.941 --> 37:07.243
That was all you.

37:07.729 --> 37:09.804
You know you're worth nothin'.

37:09.947 --> 37:11.861
You know you have no one.

37:12.041 --> 37:13.830
Then I was wrong.

37:16.677 --> 37:18.246
I have one person.

37:21.434 --> 37:25.237
I came to that same conclusion.

37:30.391 --> 37:33.293
Ty! Ty, Ty, Ty...

37:33.327 --> 37:35.730
Hey, hey, hey.

37:35.800 --> 37:37.277
Come on, get up.

37:37.349 --> 37:39.624
- No, no, no, no, no, no come on.
- He shot me.

37:39.649 --> 37:41.468
I know, stay with me, okay?
Come on, get up!

37:41.495 --> 37:43.734
Come on... Ty! No.

37:44.444 --> 37:46.132
Ty, no!

37:47.663 --> 37:50.267
Ty! I ca...

37:50.353 --> 37:52.377
I can't do thi...

37:52.845 --> 37:55.148
I can't do this without you!

37:56.166 --> 37:58.049
