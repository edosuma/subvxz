WEBVTT

00:00.005 --> 00:01.642
<i>Previously on Devious Maids...</i>

00:02.203 --> 00:04.800
I saw you kissing Dr. Sanders
in the street.

00:04.886 --> 00:07.185
I was supportive when you first gave
your power of attorney to Lucinda

00:07.186 --> 00:09.484
because I thought she had
your best interests at heart.

00:09.519 --> 00:11.578
My father kicked me out
of this house because of you.

00:11.913 --> 00:13.574
I don't want her to leave.

00:14.034 --> 00:14.818
It's Didi.

00:14.818 --> 00:16.654
I wish she was the one
going away.

00:16.688 --> 00:18.322
An opportunity
might present itself.

00:18.356 --> 00:19.490
What's wrong?

00:19.524 --> 00:21.358
There's a problem
with my kidneys.

00:21.393 --> 00:23.994
Seems the little buggers
are starting to shut down.

00:24.029 --> 00:25.863
Sounds like she's more
than a boss to you.

00:25.897 --> 00:27.531
So much more.

00:27.565 --> 00:29.366
I'm moving out tonight.

00:29.401 --> 00:31.869
I'm really sorry
that we couldn't be friends.

00:31.903 --> 00:34.004
- He knows.
- He suspects.

00:34.039 --> 00:36.373
- You think they're having an affair?
- Oh, I know they are.

00:36.408 --> 00:38.242
I need to catch her
in the unholy act

00:38.276 --> 00:40.744
so she will be crushed
and I will win.

00:40.779 --> 00:42.913
Carter killed Alejandro.

00:42.948 --> 00:45.516
That might not be
how the rest of us remember it.

00:45.550 --> 00:47.718
Kind of pathetic,
don't you think...

00:47.752 --> 00:48.852
Screwing the help?

00:48.887 --> 00:49.887
Hey, you're out of line.

00:49.921 --> 00:51.488
He's trying
to take you away from me.

00:51.523 --> 00:53.324
He doesn't love you like I do.

00:53.358 --> 00:54.992
I don't want to go back home.

00:55.026 --> 00:56.327
Well, for obvious reasons,

00:56.361 --> 00:57.928
I can't let you
stay here anymore.

00:57.963 --> 00:59.330
Well, you need something

00:59.364 --> 01:01.632
to take your mind off
all this drama with Ty.

01:01.666 --> 01:04.668
And a fabulous show-biz party
is just what the doctor ordered.

01:04.703 --> 01:05.936
You doing okay?

01:05.971 --> 01:07.571
I'm just glad he's gone.

01:11.109 --> 01:14.311
Oh, thanks, Zoila,
but I can't Friday.

01:14.346 --> 01:17.348
Spence is having a party for
the cast and crew of his show.

01:17.382 --> 01:18.415
Yeah.

01:18.450 --> 01:20.484
Can we get together tomorrow?

01:20.518 --> 01:21.719
Okay.

01:24.289 --> 01:26.991
Hold on.
I have to call you back.

01:34.532 --> 01:36.166
Carmen, what a small world.

01:36.201 --> 01:38.402
Are you following me?
Why would you think that?

01:38.436 --> 01:40.437
'Cause I also saw you
at the market this morning.

01:40.472 --> 01:42.673
Oh. And at the
movies last night.

01:42.707 --> 01:45.342
What do you think you're doing?
Okay.

01:45.377 --> 01:47.511
Yes, I-I've been waiting for
the right time to talk to you,

01:47.545 --> 01:49.713
but just to help you understand
how I feel.

01:49.748 --> 01:52.483
It doesn't matter how you feel.
I don't feel anything.

01:52.517 --> 01:54.685
- Carmen.
- I date men.

01:54.719 --> 01:57.021
And I'm sorry, Ty,
but all I see when I look at you

01:57.055 --> 01:58.889
is a confused little boy.

01:58.923 --> 02:01.425
Now, stop following me!

02:05.797 --> 02:07.765
What are we doing here, Ty?

02:07.799 --> 02:09.967
I thought we weren't gonna hang
for a while.

02:10.001 --> 02:11.502
This is sort of an emergency.

02:11.536 --> 02:13.170
Have you been reading
the papers, man?

02:13.204 --> 02:14.304
The cops asked the FBI

02:14.339 --> 02:16.140
to help find out who's doing
the home invasions.

02:16.174 --> 02:19.143
The FBI! Okay?
We can't be seen together.

02:19.177 --> 02:21.845
Clearly we're all still freaked
out over what happened, so...

02:21.880 --> 02:24.481
Fine.
I'll get to the point.

02:24.516 --> 02:27.117
I want us to hit another house.

02:27.152 --> 02:28.685
Are you high?

02:28.720 --> 02:30.354
Last time we went out,
Carter killed somebody.

02:30.388 --> 02:32.289
Hey, was I the moron who put
real bullets in the gun?

02:32.323 --> 02:34.958
- No one told you to point it at...
- Shut up, both of you!

02:34.993 --> 02:38.262
Our Robin hood days are over.

02:38.296 --> 02:41.165
No, they're not.
And here's why.

02:42.934 --> 02:46.003
I will go to the cops
and turn us all in

02:46.037 --> 02:47.471
if you don't help me.

02:49.307 --> 02:50.507
You're crazy.

02:50.542 --> 02:52.276
So the doctors tell me.

02:52.310 --> 02:55.779
Every cop in the city
is on alert.

02:55.814 --> 02:58.549
One more house.

02:58.583 --> 03:00.751
If you help me do this,
we're golden.

03:04.622 --> 03:08.459
Let's say we put the masks on
one more time.

03:08.493 --> 03:10.394
Who would we be robbing?

03:10.428 --> 03:12.496
My Uncle Spence.

03:16.067 --> 03:19.069
<b>- sync and corrections by Zac -
- www.addic7ed.com -</b>

03:27.912 --> 03:29.646
What did the doctor say?

03:29.681 --> 03:32.850
I'm not a match.
I'm so sorry.

03:32.884 --> 03:35.085
It's all right, darling.

03:35.120 --> 03:37.254
I'll just get a kidney
from someone else.

03:37.288 --> 03:38.856
Maybe I should get tested.

03:38.890 --> 03:40.557
You're sweet to offer,

03:40.592 --> 03:43.293
but I know how much Tequila
you put away on the weekends.

03:43.328 --> 03:46.063
I'd prefer to have a kidney
that wasn't so abused.

03:46.097 --> 03:48.398
For the record, I drink Tequila
on the weekends

03:48.433 --> 03:50.334
because I spend my weekdays
with you.

03:51.970 --> 03:53.837
Why not call one of our cousins
from Oklahoma?

03:53.872 --> 03:54.838
They might be a match.

03:54.873 --> 03:56.607
I detest that part
of the family.

03:56.641 --> 03:58.542
If I let them give me
a major organ,

03:58.576 --> 04:00.310
they'll think
they have the right

04:00.345 --> 04:01.712
to visit me and use my pool.

04:01.746 --> 04:03.714
Mom, this is your health
that we're talking about.

04:03.748 --> 04:07.551
I just think it would be easier
to buy one from a stranger.

04:07.585 --> 04:09.253
Zoila.

04:09.287 --> 04:11.355
You must know someone who's
strapped for cash in the barrio.

04:11.389 --> 04:13.590
<i>Santo dios.</i>

04:13.625 --> 04:16.192
Oh, good.
Give him a call.

04:16.226 --> 04:18.813
Mom, people aren't allowed
to sell their organs.

04:18.848 --> 04:19.596
Why?

04:19.630 --> 04:22.633
Poor people have organs.
Rich people need them.

04:22.667 --> 04:23.867
Why must the government

04:23.902 --> 04:25.836
always stand in the way
of the small businessman?

04:27.305 --> 04:29.806
Hey, why don't we
call Uncle Henri? No.

04:29.841 --> 04:32.843
I don't want anyone in
the family knowing about this.

04:32.877 --> 04:35.846
Promise me you won't say anything.
Okay.

04:35.880 --> 04:38.282
But you have to start taking
this thing seriously, mom.

04:38.316 --> 04:40.484
I mean, what are we gonna do
if your kidneys fail completely?

04:40.518 --> 04:42.019
Relax.

04:42.053 --> 04:44.054
I gave up food in the '80s.

04:44.088 --> 04:47.157
I see no reason why I can't
give up fluids, as well.

04:50.895 --> 04:52.629
Give me Henri's number.

04:52.664 --> 04:54.731
I just promised mom
I wouldn't call him.

04:54.766 --> 04:56.366
<i>Yeah, but I didn't.</i>

05:00.972 --> 05:03.473
I will be making a decision
about a nurse very soon.

05:03.508 --> 05:05.842
My husband gets home
from the hospital on Friday.

05:05.877 --> 05:08.345
You must be so excited.
I am.

05:08.379 --> 05:10.013
But it won't be
a quick recovery,

05:10.048 --> 05:12.482
so I'm going to need someone
who can...

05:12.517 --> 05:14.384
Put him at ease,
lift his spirits.

05:14.419 --> 05:16.820
I can do that.

05:16.854 --> 05:18.422
Uh-huh.

05:18.456 --> 05:20.257
Well, I have someone else
waiting to be interviewed, so...

05:22.794 --> 05:25.162
Somebody get me a jacket.

05:25.196 --> 05:28.465
'Cause that lady is frosty!

05:28.499 --> 05:31.101
Hi.
Sorry to keep you waiting.

05:31.135 --> 05:34.638
I'm sorry to eavesdrop,
but miss congeniality was loud.

05:34.672 --> 05:37.174
Oh, was that too catty?

05:37.208 --> 05:39.409
Shoot! Now you know I'm a bitch.
Name's Molly.

05:39.444 --> 05:41.612
Marisol.
Please, sit down.

05:41.646 --> 05:44.047
- Nice to meet you.
- Oh, I hope so.

05:44.082 --> 05:46.984
The last lady I worked for,
she said I was too brassy.

05:47.018 --> 05:48.418
I think I'm just fun,

05:48.453 --> 05:50.787
but she was the one
with lupus, so...

05:50.822 --> 05:52.356
Well, I think
you're delightful.

05:52.390 --> 05:55.092
And I'm ready to have someone
working here who makes me laugh.

05:55.126 --> 05:58.729
I recently parted ways
with a very nasty employee.

05:58.763 --> 06:02.320
Fought the urge to kick her
several times a day.

06:02.355 --> 06:03.136
Really?

06:03.171 --> 06:05.202
Shoot.
Now you know I'm a bitch.

06:05.236 --> 06:08.538
Self-deprecating.
I love that.

06:08.573 --> 06:11.275
Here is my resumee
and my references.

06:11.309 --> 06:15.245
So, cards on the table,
I really want this job.

06:15.280 --> 06:18.348
You just seem so nice,
and I love the way you dress.

06:18.383 --> 06:20.150
And if there's anything
you want to know about me,

06:20.184 --> 06:21.518
just go ahead and ask.

06:21.552 --> 06:25.122
Well, I do have one question.

06:25.156 --> 06:26.823
When can you start?

06:32.563 --> 06:34.731
Adrian, have you seem the paper?

06:34.766 --> 06:37.034
Nicholas Deering was hit
by a car.

06:37.068 --> 06:38.435
We should run over there later

06:38.469 --> 06:40.604
and drop off
some sort of bouquet.

06:40.638 --> 06:42.806
Marisol is allergic to roses,

06:42.840 --> 06:46.343
so... that seems
the logical choice.

06:47.612 --> 06:49.379
What's wrong?

06:49.414 --> 06:51.515
I know you're sleeping with Tony.

06:53.685 --> 06:54.751
So?

06:54.786 --> 06:57.087
So, you have to stop
seeing him.

06:57.121 --> 06:59.856
Mm... I'd rather not.

06:59.891 --> 07:01.325
Evelyn!

07:01.359 --> 07:02.526
Tony makes me happy.

07:02.560 --> 07:04.861
And as it turns out,
I like to be happy.

07:04.896 --> 07:06.029
What am I supposed to do?

07:06.064 --> 07:07.531
Just stand here
while you screw the help?

07:07.565 --> 07:10.567
<i>Isn't that where I stood
while you screwed the help?</i>

07:10.601 --> 07:12.836
That was different.
How?

07:12.870 --> 07:15.238
I don't know.

07:15.273 --> 07:16.540
Don't worry.

07:16.574 --> 07:18.675
Lots of people have
open marriages these days.

07:18.710 --> 07:21.078
I'm sure you will find a way
to adjust.

07:21.112 --> 07:22.412
And if it will cheer you up,

07:22.447 --> 07:23.847
I'll let you try to seduce
Valentina.

07:23.881 --> 07:24.981
She'll probably quit,

07:25.016 --> 07:27.684
but her cleaning is subpar,
so I won't care.

07:27.719 --> 07:30.454
Why would Tony want to be
with you?

07:30.488 --> 07:31.855
He finds me attractive.

07:31.889 --> 07:33.557
Which part?

07:33.591 --> 07:34.958
Your vicious tongue?

07:34.992 --> 07:36.693
Your acidic personality?

07:36.728 --> 07:40.063
Or that ice cube that lies
where your heart ought to be?

07:40.098 --> 07:42.232
You finished trying
to hurt me now?

07:42.266 --> 07:44.568
You misunderstand me.

07:44.602 --> 07:47.571
I'm saying only a man like me

07:47.605 --> 07:51.742
can be attracted
to a woman like you.

07:57.615 --> 08:02.152
S-semi annual
c-clearance sale.

08:02.186 --> 08:04.388
Very good,
Mr. Kenneth.

08:04.422 --> 08:07.124
What's going on? Rosie's using the
coupons that come in the mail

08:07.158 --> 08:09.459
to help Uncle Ken
do his speech therapy.

08:09.494 --> 08:13.430
20 p-percent off shoes.

08:13.464 --> 08:15.031
Wonderful!

08:15.066 --> 08:17.634
And I'll take that.

08:17.668 --> 08:20.804
Reg, I saw you left a bag
in Lucinda's room.

08:20.838 --> 08:22.272
Are you planning on staying
with us?

08:22.306 --> 08:24.274
Just for a couple days.
My apartment's being painted.

08:24.308 --> 08:26.676
Really?
'Cause I ran into Althea,

08:26.677 --> 08:29.045
and she says you don't
live there anymore.

08:29.046 --> 08:31.214
Your friend has no idea
what she's talking about.

08:34.352 --> 08:37.187
Well, I never knew her
to make stuff up.

08:37.221 --> 08:38.655
Hello?

08:38.688 --> 08:40.690
Let me get her.

08:40.725 --> 08:44.327
Mm.
It's Dr. Sanders.

08:44.362 --> 08:48.031
Oh, why would he be calling me?
Thank you.

08:48.065 --> 08:51.835
This is Didi Miller.

08:51.869 --> 08:54.404
Well, I'm very sorry, doctor,
but my husband is doing better,

08:54.439 --> 08:57.174
and we no longer require
your services.

08:57.208 --> 08:59.309
Why is he calling you?

08:59.343 --> 09:02.045
It's nothing.
Got to run. See y'all later.

09:02.079 --> 09:04.347
You said
you stopped seeing him.

09:04.382 --> 09:06.883
We'll talk about it later,
Rosie!

09:06.918 --> 09:10.554
We sure will.

09:10.588 --> 09:13.790
What do you mean you told him?

09:13.825 --> 09:16.593
I mean Adrian confronted me
about the affair,

09:16.627 --> 09:17.661
and I confessed.

09:17.695 --> 09:20.664
W-why would you do that?

09:20.698 --> 09:22.833
Because I adore you,

09:22.867 --> 09:24.801
and I'm sick of sneak around
in the shadows.

09:24.836 --> 09:27.170
Our relationship needs the sun
in order to grow.

09:27.205 --> 09:30.173
How did Mr. Powell react?

09:30.208 --> 09:31.908
There were
a few barbed remarks,

09:31.943 --> 09:33.810
but not much in the way
of emotion.

09:33.845 --> 09:35.812
We are jaded sophisticates,
after all.

09:35.847 --> 09:37.647
Tony?

09:37.682 --> 09:40.650
Why aren't you smiling?
This is good news.

09:40.685 --> 09:42.385
Of course.

09:44.489 --> 09:46.590
This is a wonderful thing.

09:46.624 --> 09:48.525
I have an idea.

09:48.559 --> 09:51.161
Tonight, when we make love,
let's leave the door open.

09:51.195 --> 09:52.562
Why?

09:52.597 --> 09:54.331
Adrian's never heard me orgasm
before.

09:54.365 --> 09:55.966
I thought
it might be instructive.

09:57.735 --> 09:59.569
That was a joke.

09:59.604 --> 10:01.171
Why aren't you laughing?

10:01.205 --> 10:03.073
I'm sorry.

10:03.107 --> 10:07.944
It's just... I really never
thought you'd tell him.

10:09.000 --> 10:15.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

10:17.712 --> 10:20.380
What are you doing here?

10:20.414 --> 10:22.115
Guys asked me to talk to you.

10:22.149 --> 10:23.516
About what?

10:23.551 --> 10:26.186
We can't pull another job.

10:26.220 --> 10:28.054
I'm sorry.

10:28.089 --> 10:30.657
Wasn't it the three of you
who asked me to help you

10:30.691 --> 10:33.693
- rob rich people in the first place?
- I know, but...

10:33.728 --> 10:36.872
"We can fight income inequality.
We can help the poor."

10:36.873 --> 10:39.482
And I remember everything
you used to say to me.

10:39.894 --> 10:41.862
But then someone got killed.

10:43.998 --> 10:46.800
I told you what will happen
if you bail on me.

10:46.834 --> 10:49.870
Damn it, Ty!
We're your friends.

10:49.904 --> 10:51.771
Jason just got accepted
into Yale,

10:51.806 --> 10:54.207
Carter's gonna be an intern
at C.A.A. this summer,

10:54.242 --> 10:56.676
and I've met a girl
that's really special.

10:56.711 --> 10:58.545
Our lives are just beginning.

10:58.579 --> 11:00.146
Why would you want
to ruin them?

11:00.181 --> 11:02.916
What about my life?

11:02.950 --> 11:05.452
When does it begin?

11:05.486 --> 11:07.220
Sorry?

11:07.255 --> 11:10.557
I met a girl, too,

11:10.591 --> 11:12.893
and I'm totally in love
with her.

11:12.927 --> 11:15.328
That's... great.

11:15.363 --> 11:19.766
I think she would love me
if she just saw me differently.

11:19.800 --> 11:22.068
Wait.

11:22.103 --> 11:26.406
You want us to risk
going to jail

11:26.440 --> 11:28.808
just so you can impress
some chick?

11:28.843 --> 11:30.977
Don't talk to me
like I'm stupid.

11:31.012 --> 11:32.646
I thought this through.

11:32.680 --> 11:34.648
Then enlighten me.

11:34.682 --> 11:37.517
How does us robbing your Uncle
get you this girl?

11:37.552 --> 11:39.152
Simple.

11:39.186 --> 11:41.788
I'm gonna save her life.

11:44.892 --> 11:47.928
Read me another one.

11:47.962 --> 11:50.263
No, no.

11:50.298 --> 11:52.165
That's a catalogue
for women's underwear.

11:52.199 --> 11:54.200
There are no words,
just pictures.

11:54.235 --> 11:56.036
I know.

11:58.706 --> 12:00.874
I'll be right back.

12:00.908 --> 12:04.511
Here's some real mail
to practice on.

12:12.653 --> 12:14.821
Did you see
Dr. Sanders?

12:14.855 --> 12:16.122
Yes.

12:16.157 --> 12:18.725
Mrs. Didi,
you promised!

12:18.759 --> 12:20.527
I ended the affair weeks ago,

12:20.561 --> 12:22.629
but bill started calling again.

12:22.663 --> 12:25.832
I went over there to tell him
to leave me the hell alone.

12:25.866 --> 12:29.669
And that's all that happened?
No hanky panky?

12:29.704 --> 12:32.105
No.
I swear.

12:32.139 --> 12:35.041
'Cause if Mr. Kenneth
ever found out you cheated,

12:35.076 --> 12:38.345
it would hurt him so much.
I know.

12:38.379 --> 12:41.615
And I admit the affair
was wrong,

12:41.649 --> 12:43.483
but come on.

12:43.517 --> 12:45.352
Haven't you ever made
a mistake?

12:47.788 --> 12:49.456
Okay.

12:49.490 --> 12:51.358
But if you want to stay
with Mr. Kenneth,

12:51.392 --> 12:53.259
you can have nothing to do
with that man.

12:53.294 --> 12:55.729
Don't take his calls,
don't go to his house,

12:55.763 --> 12:57.931
even to yell at him.

12:57.965 --> 13:01.034
In time,
he will get the message.

13:01.068 --> 13:03.503
Thanks for looking out for me.

13:03.537 --> 13:06.973
It's not you
I'm looking out for.

13:16.283 --> 13:17.550
Hey.

13:17.585 --> 13:19.152
So, I set up the adjustable bed
in the guest room

13:19.186 --> 13:20.620
and brought in
some I.V. stands.

13:20.655 --> 13:22.756
Anything else we need, we can
get after Nicholas gets home.

13:22.790 --> 13:25.358
Molly, you're a godsend.

13:25.393 --> 13:27.293
Aww.
What's all this?

13:27.328 --> 13:30.130
- My book.
- You're a writer? No way!

13:30.164 --> 13:31.364
Well, I'm trying to be.

13:31.399 --> 13:33.066
I used to work for a writer...

13:33.100 --> 13:35.168
Shel Sumac,
the presidential historian.

13:35.202 --> 13:37.737
I've heard of him.
Was he nice?

13:37.772 --> 13:40.106
When he was sober,
which was never.

13:40.141 --> 13:42.142
- Really?
- Oh, yeah.

13:42.176 --> 13:45.666
Oh, I-I won a Pulitzer.

13:45.700 --> 13:48.368
You must've worked
for a lot of crazies.

13:48.403 --> 13:50.571
Oh, okay, you know
Sara Innskeep, the actress?

13:50.605 --> 13:51.805
Nympho!

13:51.839 --> 13:53.941
No. Yeah. She was
totally into bondage.

13:53.975 --> 13:55.576
She used to have these guys
come over to the house,

13:55.610 --> 13:56.710
and they would
smack her around.

13:56.744 --> 13:58.545
I mean, I was appalled,

13:58.580 --> 13:59.846
un-until I saw
her new sitcom,

13:59.881 --> 14:01.481
and then I felt like
slugging her myself.

14:01.516 --> 14:03.750
You know, that's crazy.

14:03.785 --> 14:05.986
That's sort of what my book
is about...

14:06.020 --> 14:08.055
Working for the rich and famous

14:08.089 --> 14:12.059
and seeing their insanity
up close and personal.

14:12.093 --> 14:15.162
Oh. That sounds juicy. Mm.

14:15.196 --> 14:17.631
Well, I should probably stop
bothering you.

14:17.665 --> 14:19.099
No.

14:19.133 --> 14:21.435
It's so nice to finally

14:21.469 --> 14:23.804
have someone in this house
that I can talk to.

14:23.838 --> 14:25.305
Yeah,
you said you didn't care for

14:25.340 --> 14:26.740
the woman who used
to work here.

14:26.774 --> 14:28.609
Opal.

14:28.643 --> 14:31.144
She had... issues.

14:31.179 --> 14:33.438
Sounds like there's
a good story there.

14:33.473 --> 14:34.181
I shouldn't gossip.

14:34.215 --> 14:36.683
Oh, please.

14:36.718 --> 14:38.585
Just between us girls.

14:41.022 --> 14:46.093
Well... Opal had
an unusually close relationship

14:46.127 --> 14:47.494
with the first Mrs. Deering.

14:49.664 --> 14:51.932
Genevieve's fine.

14:51.966 --> 14:54.134
She's just not at the top
of the donor list,

14:54.168 --> 14:56.637
<i>so keep your fingers crossed,
mija.</i>

14:58.339 --> 15:00.641
Someone's at the door.
I got to run.

15:07.548 --> 15:10.751
Oh, my God.

15:14.989 --> 15:17.624
I am so sorry.

15:17.659 --> 15:19.126
For what?

15:19.160 --> 15:21.328
Remember, this only happened
because I don't want you to die.

15:21.362 --> 15:24.031
What happened?

15:24.065 --> 15:26.533
No, you have to promise
to forgive me first.

15:26.567 --> 15:28.802
Zoila, what's going on?

15:28.836 --> 15:31.705
Well... I sort of called
Henri.

15:31.739 --> 15:33.840
You did what?!

15:33.875 --> 15:36.877
And I told him you didn't want
the family to know.

15:36.911 --> 15:39.680
Please tell me
he didn't call her.

15:39.714 --> 15:42.049
Where is everybody?!

15:42.083 --> 15:44.251
Oh, for crap sake.

15:44.285 --> 15:47.287
This place has more doors
than a whorehouse.

15:49.023 --> 15:52.793
And with that much makeup,
you'd be the star attraction.

15:54.095 --> 15:55.529
Hello, mother.

16:04.234 --> 16:05.902
Sorry I'm late.

16:05.936 --> 16:07.537
Why are you dressed like that?

16:07.571 --> 16:08.905
I'm being stalked by Ty.

16:08.939 --> 16:10.907
I don't want him
to recognize me.

16:10.941 --> 16:12.375
Then stop wearing makeup.

16:12.409 --> 16:13.876
How will that help?

16:13.911 --> 16:16.612
I've seen you without makeup.
You are unrecognizable.

16:16.647 --> 16:19.415
I can't wait to be your age.

16:19.449 --> 16:21.918
Then I won't have to worry about
men following me.

16:21.952 --> 16:25.321
So, then Marisol gets a call
from the police.

16:25.355 --> 16:28.391
Turns out her fiance's
in the hospital.

16:28.425 --> 16:29.825
Shh!

16:29.860 --> 16:31.994
That woman is talking about
Marisol.

16:32.029 --> 16:34.263
So, even though he lied to her,

16:34.298 --> 16:37.934
she marries him just
because he's been hit by a car.

16:37.968 --> 16:39.669
Hey.

16:39.703 --> 16:41.103
Would you like to hear about
our specials?

16:41.138 --> 16:43.172
Can you come back later?

16:43.207 --> 16:45.675
We're trying to listen
to a private conversation.

16:45.709 --> 16:47.610
I mean, who does that?

16:47.644 --> 16:50.746
I mean, who gets married
in a hospital? It's crazy.

16:53.617 --> 16:56.118
You alphabetize
your skin-care products?

16:56.153 --> 16:58.020
Huh?

16:58.055 --> 17:00.423
And why would you eat a box of
girl scout cookies for breakfast?

17:00.457 --> 17:02.491
I've been under
a lot of stress lately,

17:02.526 --> 17:03.793
and how do you know that?

17:03.827 --> 17:06.596
Your new nurse has a big mouth.

17:06.630 --> 17:09.298
Molly has been gossiping
about me?

17:09.333 --> 17:10.800
With her friends at the cafe.

17:10.834 --> 17:12.435
So, you want to pour me
a scotch?

17:12.469 --> 17:14.670
- I know you have 16 bottles.
- Whoa, whoa, wait.

17:14.704 --> 17:16.872
Molly didn't reveal
anything embarrassing, did she?

17:16.906 --> 17:19.308
She told them about
your impromptu wedding

17:19.343 --> 17:20.843
and your doubts about Nick.

17:20.877 --> 17:22.678
Oh, my God.

17:22.713 --> 17:25.314
But on a positive note,
she really likes your book.

17:25.348 --> 17:27.450
My book is in galleys.
Nobody's read m...

17:29.019 --> 17:31.487
Oh, my God.

17:31.521 --> 17:33.889
Come on.

17:33.924 --> 17:35.992
It's time to break out
the cookies and the scotch.

17:45.402 --> 17:48.671
Mr. Powell?
Are you okay?

17:48.705 --> 17:50.706
You seem depressed.

17:50.741 --> 17:53.809
It's one of the side effects
of total emasculation.

17:53.844 --> 17:55.444
I'm sorry.

17:55.479 --> 17:57.246
I don't know that word.

17:57.281 --> 18:00.483
It's what happens to a man
when he becomes a cuckold.

18:00.517 --> 18:02.251
Oh.

18:02.286 --> 18:03.986
Don't know that one either,
do you?

18:04.021 --> 18:05.187
Not a clue.

18:05.222 --> 18:07.890
My wife is betraying me
with another man.

18:07.924 --> 18:10.693
I've lost all semblance
of dignity. No.

18:10.727 --> 18:12.428
You're still dignified.

18:12.462 --> 18:15.498
It's funny.

18:15.532 --> 18:17.967
I've been married to Evelyn
all these years,

18:18.001 --> 18:19.869
but I didn't know
how much I loved her

18:19.903 --> 18:22.004
until I saw her in the arms
of another man.

18:22.039 --> 18:24.206
I think
it's good you know that.

18:24.241 --> 18:25.875
Now you can fight for her.

18:25.909 --> 18:27.777
No, it's too late.

18:27.811 --> 18:30.913
You know what I do
when life seems hopeless?

18:30.947 --> 18:32.615
I pray.

18:32.649 --> 18:33.849
Oh.

18:33.884 --> 18:36.185
Poor people have
the most interesting hobbies.

18:36.219 --> 18:39.588
Maybe you should ask God
for guidance.

18:39.623 --> 18:41.924
Mm, after the life I've led,

18:41.958 --> 18:45.094
I'd be embarrassed
to ask for God's help.

18:45.128 --> 18:48.197
Well, if you don't mind,
I'm gonna pray for you.

18:48.231 --> 18:49.999
I would like that.

18:50.033 --> 18:52.902
You are a paragon
of munificence.

18:54.404 --> 18:56.272
That means you're nice.

19:05.048 --> 19:07.917
When are they going to finish
painting your apartment?

19:07.951 --> 19:09.652
You're not trying
to get rid of me, are you?

19:09.686 --> 19:10.553
No.

19:10.587 --> 19:13.089
- I like having you here.
- Good.

19:13.123 --> 19:14.757
'Cause I like being here.

19:17.961 --> 19:20.429
I'll get it.

19:24.601 --> 19:27.269
- Can I help you?
- Where's Didi?

19:27.304 --> 19:28.537
She's not here.

19:28.572 --> 19:30.172
You're Dr. Sanders,
right?

19:30.207 --> 19:31.474
You used to take care
of my Uncle Ken.

19:31.508 --> 19:33.776
She won't return my calls,
and I have to see her.

19:33.810 --> 19:36.078
Mrs. Didi told you

19:36.113 --> 19:39.615
she does not want you to...
Be her doctor anymore!

19:39.649 --> 19:42.251
You have to leave!
Didi?!

19:42.285 --> 19:43.819
I don't think so, buddy.

19:46.590 --> 19:49.291
- That was weird, huh?
- What was that?

19:49.326 --> 19:51.293
It is none of our business.

19:51.328 --> 19:53.662
That man tried to break
into my family's home.

19:53.697 --> 19:55.264
It's absolutely my business.

19:55.298 --> 19:57.633
Okay.

19:57.667 --> 20:00.336
But you've got to promise
not to tell anyone.

20:00.370 --> 20:02.505
I promise.
What's going on?

20:02.539 --> 20:07.143
When Mr. Kenneth was sicker,
it was very hard on Mrs. Didi.

20:07.177 --> 20:08.511
She got lonely.

20:08.545 --> 20:11.213
Got friendly
with the good doctor?

20:11.248 --> 20:15.217
But it's over now,
and she's so sorry.

20:15.252 --> 20:17.653
Uncle Ken doesn't know?

20:17.687 --> 20:20.089
That's why you can't say
anything.

20:20.123 --> 20:22.191
Mr. Kenneth will be
so hurt.

20:29.366 --> 20:31.333
Look, grandma.

20:31.368 --> 20:33.969
Zoila made fried chicken and
corn on the cob in your honor.

20:34.004 --> 20:35.237
If I really mattered,

20:35.272 --> 20:37.640
one of you would've called me
a week ago

20:37.674 --> 20:39.642
to say
that my daughter's dying.

20:39.676 --> 20:41.577
I'm not that sick, mother.

20:41.611 --> 20:43.012
Don't lie.

20:43.046 --> 20:46.248
I can see it in your body.
You're wasting away.

20:46.283 --> 20:48.317
This is my normal weight,
mother.

20:48.351 --> 20:51.487
You should've seen her
when she was six.

20:51.521 --> 20:54.824
Everyone called her
the butterball express.

20:54.858 --> 20:57.092
Not everyone, mother.
Just you.

20:57.127 --> 20:58.494
You used to be fat?

20:58.528 --> 20:59.862
I was zaftig.

20:59.896 --> 21:02.064
German women are zaftig.

21:02.098 --> 21:03.432
You were fat.

21:03.467 --> 21:05.067
Do you want some iced tea?

21:05.101 --> 21:07.670
Only if it's laced with valium.

21:09.105 --> 21:11.574
Don't know why
you're so angry at me.

21:11.608 --> 21:13.976
I haven't seen you
for two years.

21:14.010 --> 21:15.511
Well, you're here now.

21:15.545 --> 21:18.347
So, why don't
we just enjoy this...

21:18.381 --> 21:20.716
Ridiculously unhealthy meal.

21:20.750 --> 21:22.751
You need more fat in your diet.

21:22.786 --> 21:25.588
Women look better
when they're a little chubby.

21:25.622 --> 21:26.956
Well, like Zoila here.

21:26.990 --> 21:29.625
Where did you say
we keep that valium?

21:29.659 --> 21:32.061
I'm sorry
I'm not in a good mood.

21:32.095 --> 21:34.363
It's been a stressful time.

21:34.397 --> 21:35.631
Bull.

21:35.665 --> 21:38.934
You just don't want me to visit,
and I know why.

21:38.969 --> 21:41.370
'Cause I don't let you act
like a phony.

21:41.404 --> 21:42.671
What are you talking about?

21:42.706 --> 21:44.440
You put on airs,

21:44.474 --> 21:48.077
use big words
like your rich, snobby friends.

21:48.111 --> 21:50.880
Her name isn't really Genevieve,
you know.

21:50.914 --> 21:52.982
What?
Knock it off, mother.

21:53.016 --> 21:56.819
She got "Genevieve"
from a romance novel.

21:56.853 --> 21:59.121
Her real name is eunice.

21:59.155 --> 22:01.223
Eunice Mudge.

22:01.258 --> 22:03.492
I'll put you in a nursing home,
so help me.

22:03.527 --> 22:06.395
She made her brother, Henry,
change his name, too.

22:06.429 --> 22:07.463
Big phony.

22:07.497 --> 22:09.098
One with bars on the windows!

22:09.132 --> 22:11.133
See how she talks to me?

22:11.167 --> 22:14.770
All I want to do is enjoy
my corn on the cob,

22:14.804 --> 22:18.440
and I can't
because she's got to yell at me.

22:18.475 --> 22:20.342
Do you know why I yell, mother?

22:20.377 --> 22:22.811
It's because
I'm trying to rise above

22:22.846 --> 22:25.481
the muck and mire
of my childhood

22:25.515 --> 22:29.184
to create a life of elegance
and refinement and...

22:29.219 --> 22:32.454
For God's sakes, mother,
what are you doing?

22:32.489 --> 22:35.691
I got something stuck
on my choppers.

22:35.725 --> 22:37.493
Grandma,
put your teeth back in.

22:41.197 --> 22:43.198
Sorry, folks.

22:43.233 --> 22:45.801
After 80,
corn is not your friend.

22:45.835 --> 22:48.871
I can't do this.

22:48.905 --> 22:50.639
Where are you going?

22:50.674 --> 22:52.675
I can't.
Not anymore.

22:52.709 --> 22:54.710
I'm sorry.

23:00.116 --> 23:02.384
Are you all right?

23:02.419 --> 23:03.819
I want her out of this house.

23:03.853 --> 23:06.722
She's your mother.
You can't kick her out.

23:06.756 --> 23:08.090
You're right.

23:08.124 --> 23:10.059
I can't, but you can.

23:10.093 --> 23:12.094
Hold on a second.

23:12.128 --> 23:14.897
You brought her here.
You get rid of her.

23:14.931 --> 23:16.765
And that's an order.

23:23.587 --> 23:25.955
I brought you into my
home because I trusted you.

23:25.989 --> 23:27.890
Now I find out
that you're sharing

23:27.924 --> 23:30.759
the most private parts of
my life with total strangers?

23:30.794 --> 23:32.795
And judging me?

23:32.829 --> 23:34.330
I am super sorry,

23:34.364 --> 23:36.999
but you might want to climb down
off that high horse you're on.

23:37.033 --> 23:38.834
High horse?

23:38.869 --> 23:40.736
I read your book, remember?

23:40.770 --> 23:42.972
You write about all those loons
you used to work for

23:43.006 --> 23:44.673
in Beverly Hills
when you were a maid.

23:44.708 --> 23:48.177
You discuss in detail
their lives and their problems,

23:48.211 --> 23:52.281
and going by your tone,
you judge them plenty.

23:52.315 --> 23:57.319
All I did was tell the truth
about the things that I saw.

23:57.354 --> 23:58.587
So, you're better than me

23:58.622 --> 24:00.756
because you put your gossip down
on paper?

24:02.325 --> 24:03.993
Look, it's okay.
We all do it.

24:04.027 --> 24:06.428
Everybody talks about
other people's lives.

24:08.598 --> 24:12.501
You're right.
I'm a hypocrite.

24:12.536 --> 24:15.638
It's okay.
I won't tell anyone.

24:15.672 --> 24:18.707
I know you won't,

24:18.742 --> 24:20.843
because you're gonna sign
a confidentiality agreement.

24:20.877 --> 24:22.611
Come on.

24:22.646 --> 24:24.313
For you to work here,
I need to know

24:24.347 --> 24:28.785
that you're not gonna talk about
my private life, or anyone else's.

24:28.820 --> 24:31.754
I gave up coke.
I guess I can give up gossip.

24:31.788 --> 24:33.756
You know,
for all the high-profile folks

24:33.790 --> 24:35.658
that you've worked for,
I'm surprised

24:35.692 --> 24:38.627
that no one has made you sign a
confidentiality agreement before.

24:38.662 --> 24:41.297
Oh, one guy did...
A rock star in Bel Air.

24:41.331 --> 24:42.898
His mansion was orgy city.

24:42.933 --> 24:44.733
- Molly!
- Sorry.

24:44.768 --> 24:47.069
I just can't give it up
cold Turkey.

24:50.407 --> 24:52.308
Mr. Kenneth.

24:52.342 --> 24:54.176
The mail is here.

24:54.211 --> 24:56.712
It's time to do our therapy.

24:58.815 --> 25:00.516
Mr. Kenneth.

25:05.288 --> 25:07.122
Are we ready?

25:07.157 --> 25:10.025
Any c-c-catalogues?

25:10.060 --> 25:13.195
Not the kind you're looking for,
you dirty old man.

25:17.500 --> 25:19.235
What shall we read today?

25:19.269 --> 25:22.338
Credit-card offers,
bills.

25:22.372 --> 25:25.140
Oh.

25:25.175 --> 25:27.042
You've got some sort of letter.

25:27.077 --> 25:30.512
Why don't you read this
to me, hmm?

25:32.382 --> 25:34.516
"Dear... Kenneth."

25:34.551 --> 25:38.954
Very good.
You didn't stutter that time.

25:38.989 --> 25:44.848
"I'm writing
to let you know that..."

25:46.491 --> 25:49.593
No, no, don't stop.
You're doing so good.

25:53.598 --> 25:55.632
Mr. Kenneth?

25:59.659 --> 26:01.606
_

26:01.641 --> 26:03.558
_

26:03.643 --> 26:06.399
_

26:12.150 --> 26:15.452
Oh, Mr. Kenneth,
I'm so sorry.

26:24.529 --> 26:26.663
Thank you, Tony.

26:26.697 --> 26:27.998
Of course, Mrs. Powell.

26:28.032 --> 26:31.668
Oh, I can't wait to see what
Marisol has done to this place.

26:31.702 --> 26:33.170
I have a sinking feeling

26:33.204 --> 26:37.274
she's festooned the interior
with pinatas.

26:37.308 --> 26:38.575
Mr. Powell.

26:38.609 --> 26:41.678
We obviously haven't had
the chance to speak,

26:41.712 --> 26:43.780
and I just wanted to say

26:43.815 --> 26:45.515
I'm sorry about the position
I've put you in.

26:45.550 --> 26:47.617
Honestly, I'm more concerned

26:47.652 --> 26:50.353
about the positions
you've put my wife in.

26:55.622 --> 26:58.157
Evelyn, Adrian.

26:58.191 --> 27:00.059
Someone I don't know, hi.

27:00.093 --> 27:01.727
We heard about
what happened to Nick.

27:01.762 --> 27:04.063
Even though we haven't spoken
to him in years,

27:04.097 --> 27:05.498
we were very concerned.

27:05.532 --> 27:07.967
You're sweet to stop by.

27:08.001 --> 27:10.636
Please, come in.

27:18.145 --> 27:21.514
Allow me to introduce
our driver, Dick.

27:22.816 --> 27:24.483
Tony.

27:24.518 --> 27:26.452
Oh, of course.
What was I thinking?

27:26.486 --> 27:29.121
We brought you
a little something...

27:29.156 --> 27:31.857
Just our way of letting Nicholas
know we're thinking of him.

27:31.892 --> 27:34.493
They're absolutely gorgeous.

27:34.528 --> 27:35.661
Molly!

27:35.696 --> 27:38.798
Would you mind putting these
in some water?

27:38.832 --> 27:41.901
I think there's a vase
in the dining room.

27:41.935 --> 27:44.804
So thoughtful.
Roses.

27:46.506 --> 27:48.541
Tony, wait for us outside.

27:48.575 --> 27:50.042
We'll only be a moment.

27:50.077 --> 27:52.078
Of course.

27:52.112 --> 27:54.346
Please, come sit.
Oh.

27:54.381 --> 27:56.882
Marisol, I love
what you've done with the place.

27:56.917 --> 27:59.518
- I haven't changed a thing.
- I know.

27:59.553 --> 28:03.222
I'll be back in a moment.
I need to use the facilities.

28:07.627 --> 28:09.195
Molly, was it?

28:09.229 --> 28:11.230
May I help you?
Forgive me,

28:11.264 --> 28:14.366
but I couldn't help notice.

28:14.401 --> 28:17.036
Sorry about that.
No, no, no, it's all right.

28:17.070 --> 28:19.672
I take it you know Tony?

28:19.706 --> 28:23.542
Look, I'm not supposed
to gossip.

28:23.577 --> 28:25.811
But...

28:25.846 --> 28:29.381
<i>When I knew him,
his name wasn't Tony.</i>

28:31.952 --> 28:34.120
You must tell me more.

28:41.443 --> 28:45.045
Hello, Mr. Powell.

28:45.080 --> 28:47.047
Good evening, Valentina.

28:47.082 --> 28:50.184
I wanted you to know
I've been praying for you.

28:50.218 --> 28:53.187
Well, you could stop now,
my dear.

28:53.221 --> 28:55.756
It worked.

29:01.463 --> 29:03.697
There's been
an unexpected complication.

29:03.732 --> 29:05.933
Her husband has found out
about the affair.

29:05.967 --> 29:07.935
No, it's fine.

29:07.969 --> 29:10.371
I just have to come up
with a new plan.

29:10.405 --> 29:12.106
Oh, believe me,

29:12.140 --> 29:15.676
I am counting down the minutes
till I can dump this bitch.

29:20.115 --> 29:21.315
Hello, darling.

29:21.349 --> 29:23.550
Hello, my love.

29:27.188 --> 29:29.623
Hey, you.
Where's my daughter?

29:29.658 --> 29:31.825
In her room, resting.

29:31.860 --> 29:34.628
Yeah, I'll bet.
She is.

29:34.663 --> 29:37.498
This kidney thing,
it's really taking its toll.

29:37.532 --> 29:41.869
In fact... I was thinking
maybe you should come back

29:41.903 --> 29:44.338
some other time,
when she's better.

29:44.372 --> 29:46.907
Did she tell you
to throw me out?

29:46.942 --> 29:49.777
My daughter, the class act.

29:49.811 --> 29:52.579
Well, can you blame her?

29:52.614 --> 29:54.949
I'm sure you mean well,
but you are...

29:54.983 --> 29:56.684
A pain in the ass?

29:56.718 --> 29:58.385
Times 10.

30:00.855 --> 30:05.225
I was a single mom in the '50s.

30:05.260 --> 30:07.361
There weren't many of us
back then.

30:07.395 --> 30:09.596
I'd look for work,

30:09.631 --> 30:11.532
and people would tell me
"get a husband."

30:11.566 --> 30:16.270
I'd get work, and my boss would
try to pinch my ass, or worse.

30:16.304 --> 30:18.939
I had to be tough for my kids.

30:18.974 --> 30:21.508
But they're grown.

30:21.543 --> 30:25.346
Can't you relax and take pride
in a job well done?

30:25.380 --> 30:29.950
I'm not so proud
of how "Genevieve" turned out.

30:29.985 --> 30:32.586
She's a wonderful human being.

30:32.620 --> 30:35.656
And so what if she moved to L.A.
to reinvent herself?

30:35.690 --> 30:36.690
She's allowed.

30:36.725 --> 30:40.361
She's not allowed to be ashamed
of me.

30:40.395 --> 30:43.163
She's not allowed to forget
what I did for her,

30:43.198 --> 30:48.302
how I put clothes on her back
a-and a roof over her head.

30:48.336 --> 30:52.373
I'm not sure what she remembers
about her childhood,

30:52.407 --> 30:55.042
but I'm sure she loves you.

30:55.076 --> 30:57.945
I would like her love.

30:57.979 --> 31:00.447
But I demand her respect.

31:02.217 --> 31:05.719
If she wants me to leave,

31:05.754 --> 31:08.322
she can tell me herself.

31:16.798 --> 31:18.098
Well?

31:18.133 --> 31:20.067
Did you throw her out?

31:20.101 --> 31:22.069
I'm sorry.
I couldn't do it.

31:22.103 --> 31:23.337
Why not?

31:23.371 --> 31:26.306
Do you know
what the fifth commandment is?

31:27.909 --> 31:30.944
It's thou shalt honor
they mother and thy father.

31:30.979 --> 31:34.248
Zoila, you've seen how she is.

31:34.282 --> 31:36.617
How could I honor that?

31:36.651 --> 31:39.019
By remembering everything
that she did right

31:39.054 --> 31:41.789
and forgiving her for everything
that she did wrong.

31:41.823 --> 31:45.325
Because one day, she will die,

31:45.360 --> 31:47.661
and if you haven't done
everything that you can

31:47.695 --> 31:50.230
to build a relationship
with that woman,

31:50.265 --> 31:52.332
honey...

31:52.367 --> 31:54.935
You will be so sad.

31:57.772 --> 32:00.207
Please, look.

32:00.241 --> 32:03.444
If you talk to Kenny...
If you just talk to him...

32:03.478 --> 32:06.513
You can just tell him
it doesn't make any sense.

32:06.548 --> 32:08.649
Look, you signed this.

32:10.285 --> 32:13.287
I'll be right back.

32:13.321 --> 32:16.924
Please.
I love my husband.

32:16.958 --> 32:18.258
I love him.

32:18.293 --> 32:19.626
What's going on?

32:19.661 --> 32:21.395
Uncle Ken asked
me and his business managers

32:21.429 --> 32:23.330
to inform Didi
that he wants a divorce.

32:23.364 --> 32:25.332
No.

32:25.366 --> 32:26.934
Because of that letter?

32:26.968 --> 32:28.936
We're going over
the prenup she signed.

32:28.970 --> 32:30.104
She's leaving tomorrow.

32:30.138 --> 32:31.805
But Didi knows
she made a mistake.

32:31.840 --> 32:33.006
Didn't she tell him that?

32:33.041 --> 32:34.274
He doesn't care.

32:34.309 --> 32:37.311
Now that he knows
she was unfaithful, it's over.

32:37.345 --> 32:40.948
I feel so bad.
I know.

32:40.982 --> 32:42.649
It's awful.

32:42.684 --> 32:44.952
That's why I'm gonna stick
around here a while longer.

32:44.986 --> 32:47.788
Uncle Ken needs family
right now.

32:47.822 --> 32:49.756
Oh, o-okay.

32:49.791 --> 32:51.558
I-I got to get back.

32:51.593 --> 32:53.894
Uh, would you mind bringing
my briefcase upstairs for me?

32:53.928 --> 32:56.029
Sure.

32:56.064 --> 32:57.631
Oh, you forgot your pad.

32:57.665 --> 32:59.433
Please, just talk to him.

32:59.467 --> 33:01.635
Didi, do you see this?
This is your signature.

33:01.669 --> 33:03.670
But I love him.

33:03.705 --> 33:06.607
But you signed it,
and these are legal documents.

33:31.597 --> 33:34.165
Zoila, I can't find the remote.

33:34.200 --> 33:35.266
I told you.

33:35.301 --> 33:37.869
I put it on the table
next to your chair.

33:37.903 --> 33:40.638
Well, I don't think you did,
but...

33:43.342 --> 33:44.709
Psst!

33:50.916 --> 33:53.251
I've been thinking.
You were right.

33:53.285 --> 33:55.286
I can't kick my mother
out of my house.

33:55.321 --> 33:57.856
It would be something I'd regret
for the rest of my life.

33:57.890 --> 33:59.124
Good girl.

33:59.158 --> 34:02.560
But I need more time
to figure out how to handle her,

34:02.595 --> 34:05.430
so...

34:05.464 --> 34:07.098
What's that?

34:07.133 --> 34:09.934
I'm going to the four seasons
for a few weeks.

34:09.969 --> 34:10.969
Wait!

34:11.003 --> 34:13.405
Who's gonna take care
of your mother?

34:13.438 --> 34:15.739
Zoila!
It's not here!

34:15.775 --> 34:18.275
I hope in time,
you'll find a way to forgive me.

34:18.310 --> 34:20.311
No!

34:20.346 --> 34:22.714
Zoila!

34:27.652 --> 34:31.089
So nice to meet you.
Hey.

34:31.123 --> 34:33.525
I know you.
You work on Spence's show.

34:33.559 --> 34:36.928
Hi. I can't believe I'm meeting Dr.
Blake McDye,

34:36.962 --> 34:39.397
the evil,
bipolar heart surgeon.

34:39.431 --> 34:40.965
I hate you so much.

34:41.000 --> 34:43.802
Uh... thank you.

34:43.835 --> 34:45.270
Hi, Carmen.

34:45.304 --> 34:47.371
Damn it, Ty!

34:47.406 --> 34:49.474
If you don't leave now,
I'm gonna call the police.

34:49.507 --> 34:52.342
I'm only here because I left my
chemistry textbook in my room.

34:52.378 --> 34:54.112
I'll only be a minute.

34:54.146 --> 34:55.980
I-I'm not here to bother you.
Honest.

34:56.014 --> 34:58.783
Make it fast.

35:05.224 --> 35:07.892
All right.
He's good.

35:07.927 --> 35:09.260
I got the code to the gate,

35:09.295 --> 35:11.162
so getting in is gonna be
a piece of cake.

35:11.197 --> 35:12.831
Here's how it's gonna go down.

35:12.865 --> 35:16.034
Ty wants to be
the big hero tonight,

35:16.068 --> 35:18.436
so we're gonna go in
and follow our normal game plan,

35:18.471 --> 35:20.772
and then I'm gonna grab the maid
and threaten her.

35:20.806 --> 35:23.408
Whoa, man, nobody's supposed
to get hurt.

35:23.442 --> 35:24.676
Nobody will.

35:24.710 --> 35:27.378
"Our hero" is gonna overpower me
and save the day,

35:27.413 --> 35:28.546
and then we run out.

35:28.581 --> 35:30.048
Ty's gonna overpower you?

35:30.082 --> 35:31.983
Is anybody gonna believe that?

35:32.017 --> 35:34.486
If that's what he wants,
then that's what's gonna happen.

35:34.520 --> 35:37.222
And then we're done with
that clown forever, you got it?

35:37.256 --> 35:39.157
Good.

35:54.273 --> 35:55.640
You said one minute.

35:55.674 --> 35:57.308
I know it's here somewhere.

35:57.343 --> 36:00.812
Look, if this is just some
excuse to talk to me, I'm...

36:01.947 --> 36:03.648
Oh.

36:03.682 --> 36:05.116
Well, I-I guess
you can go now.

36:05.151 --> 36:06.951
Carmen, listen.

36:06.986 --> 36:09.454
I'm sorry
I've been upsetting you,

36:09.488 --> 36:13.892
but I'm really not
the creepy kid you think I am.

36:13.926 --> 36:15.026
I'm a man.

36:15.060 --> 36:17.562
And I just keep hoping

36:17.596 --> 36:20.031
that one day,
you'll see me that way.

36:20.065 --> 36:23.368
But if you don't even want to be
friends with me,

36:23.402 --> 36:25.403
then I'll understand.

36:25.437 --> 36:28.006
Spence: Carmen!
People want cake.

36:29.341 --> 36:30.675
We'll see.

36:30.709 --> 36:33.311
Just give me some time.

36:44.690 --> 36:46.124
It's not really my height.

36:46.158 --> 36:47.859
Where were you?
I'll tell you later.

36:47.893 --> 36:49.594
- Let's cut the cake.
- Yeah.

36:49.628 --> 36:51.462
Everyone on your knees!

36:52.798 --> 36:54.499
What the hell is this?

36:54.533 --> 36:57.769
On your knees, people!

36:59.471 --> 37:02.006
Wallets and jewelry
in the bag, now!

37:03.609 --> 37:04.809
What are you doing?

37:04.843 --> 37:06.978
I'm not letting this happen
again.

37:07.012 --> 37:09.414
- Put that away!
- 911. What's your emergency?

37:09.448 --> 37:11.316
Ah! Nice try.

37:11.350 --> 37:13.051
Hey, hey, just... just let
her...

37:13.085 --> 37:14.752
Listen up, morons!

37:14.787 --> 37:17.322
If anyone tries anything,
we will shoot her!

37:17.356 --> 37:20.725
- Let her go!
- Ty, get down.

37:21.961 --> 37:23.595
You're gonna get the lady
killed.

37:24.964 --> 37:26.764
On your knees now.

37:28.234 --> 37:29.601
So help me.

37:46.518 --> 37:48.052
Screw this!

37:51.690 --> 37:53.091
We've got to get out of here!
Stay down!

37:59.765 --> 38:01.466
Dude, you're bleeding
pretty bad.

38:01.500 --> 38:03.401
We've got to get you
to the hospital.

38:03.435 --> 38:05.336
No, no, that's where the police
will be looking.

38:05.371 --> 38:07.238
Just drive.
I know where to go.

38:19.551 --> 38:21.152
Yes, sir.

38:21.186 --> 38:24.155
And these home invaders
didn't take anything?

38:24.189 --> 38:25.456
They didn't have time.

38:25.491 --> 38:27.225
After my maid stabbed the one
guy, the other two ran out.

38:27.259 --> 38:29.193
That's a good maid.

38:29.228 --> 38:31.262
Might want to get yourself
a gun for protection. Mm.

38:31.297 --> 38:32.397
I got a 9 mil under my bed.

38:32.431 --> 38:33.865
There just wasn't time
to get it.

38:33.899 --> 38:36.000
Yeah.

38:36.035 --> 38:39.070
- Excuse me.
- Sure.

38:42.741 --> 38:45.009
I heard what happened.

38:45.044 --> 38:46.177
Is Carmen okay?

38:46.211 --> 38:48.012
Oh, she's great.
She's great.

38:48.047 --> 38:49.781
She saved the day, you know?

38:49.815 --> 38:52.417
I heard.

38:54.820 --> 38:57.622
A-are you all right?

38:57.656 --> 39:00.558
Yeah, sure. Just a little
shaken up. That's all.

39:00.592 --> 39:02.460
Good.

39:02.494 --> 39:04.395
I'm glad you weren't hurt.

39:04.430 --> 39:07.298
Yeah? I thought
you were still mad at me

39:07.333 --> 39:09.867
about that little dust-up
I had with Reggie.

39:09.902 --> 39:13.438
I think he needed
a little dusting up.

39:15.474 --> 39:18.176
I-it's good to see you,
Spence.

39:21.680 --> 39:24.716
Carmen.
The girls are on their way over.

39:24.750 --> 39:28.219
Zoila's bringing tacos.
Marisol is bringing booze.

39:28.253 --> 39:30.421
We're gonna take
good care of you.

39:30.456 --> 39:33.358
That's so sweet,
but just being here is enough.

39:33.392 --> 39:34.659
No, Carmen.

39:34.693 --> 39:36.194
They put a gun to your head.

39:36.228 --> 39:38.296
You're allowed to get
a little drunk.

39:38.330 --> 39:39.931
<i>I wasn't that scared.</i>

39:39.965 --> 39:41.499
Mostly I was angry.

39:41.533 --> 39:44.502
I knew in seconds those were
the men who killed Alejandro.

39:44.536 --> 39:46.938
But then this guy...

39:46.972 --> 39:50.041
Decides to be a hero.

39:50.075 --> 39:53.111
I mean, I fell on my face.

39:53.145 --> 39:55.913
I didn't see anybody else
stand up to those punks.

39:55.948 --> 39:57.915
He distracted the leader,

39:57.950 --> 40:00.351
which gave me enough time
to stab him.

40:00.386 --> 40:02.053
You sound like a hero to me.

40:03.722 --> 40:05.323
The detective got
some good news.

40:05.357 --> 40:07.759
He's confident they're gonna
find the guys that did this.

40:07.793 --> 40:10.595
But they were wearing masks.
How are you gonna find them?

40:10.629 --> 40:11.963
Well, we're watching
all the hospitals.

40:11.997 --> 40:15.433
The one that got stabbed...
He's got to go somewhere.

40:25.010 --> 40:26.778
Ethan?

40:33.607 --> 40:36.342
Ethan. Ethan!

40:36.376 --> 40:38.210
Ethan!

40:38.245 --> 40:39.912
What is it?!
