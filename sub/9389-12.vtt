to go to these lengths

just to get away
with smoking pot,

09:43.458 --> 09:45.377
it's time to
make a change.

09:45.460 --> 09:47.296
You're right, Lois.
It is time to make a change.

09:47.379 --> 09:48.630

to legalize marijuana.

You can be a
superstar author.

19:55.362 --> 19:56.613
All you got
to do is make

19:56.697 --> 19:59.157
an impassioned anti-pot
speech in public.

19:59.241 --> 20:00.409
Forget it, Carter.

20:00.492 --> 20:02.494
Even Stewie says the book
is good enough on its own.

20:02.578 --> 20:04.746
-Right, Stewie?
-Uh...

20:04.830 --> 20:07.708
Maybe do a song
about why pot is bad.

20:07.791 --> 20:10.627
And that's why pot is bad

20:10.711 --> 20:12.921
(APPLAUSE)

20:13.005 --> 20:15.924
I've heard all I need
to make an informed decision.

20:16.008 --> 20:19.636
Marijuana is hereby
re-illegalized.

20:24.099 --> 20:26.268
In other news,
a local Quahog author

20:26.351 --> 20:29.730
has set a record for the worst
selling novel of all time.

20:29.813 --> 20:32.524
Brian Griffin's
Faster than the Speed of Love

20:32.608 --> 20:34.943
has astonishingly not sold
a single copy,

20:35.027 --> 20:37.571
thanks to universal panning
by literary critics.

20:37.654 --> 20:39.907
Coming up: children
are getting sexier,

20:39.990 --> 20:41.950
and that's...

20:42.034 --> 20:43.452
That's pretty cool.

20:43.535 --> 20:45.537
This is so humiliating.

20:45.621 --> 20:47.456
I sold out everything
I believed in,

20:47.539 --> 20:49.208
and I have nothing
to show for it.

20:49.291 --> 20:50.542
My book's a bomb.

20:50.626 --> 20:52.044
Well, look
at it this way.

20:52.127 --> 20:53.504
You did accomplish
something.

20:53.587 --> 20:55.672
Marijuana is illegal
because of you.

20:55.756 --> 20:57.966
And Stewie got to build
a nice little fort

20:58.050 --> 20:59.885
with all of your
unsold books.

20:59.968 --> 21:02.179
My house is made of mediocrity.

21:02.262 --> 21:04.306
(DOORBELL RINGING)

21:04.389 --> 21:05.849
Hey, guys,
I want you to know

21:05.933 --> 21:07.726
I'm raising
my reward to $50

21:07.809 --> 21:09.269
for anyone who can
help me find James.

21:09.353 --> 21:10.896
No questions asked.

21:10.979 --> 21:12.231
I killed your cat.

21:14.316 --> 21:16.318
