I think you just...

00:55.260 --> 00:57.550
You just screamed out "Dad".
Were you dreaming about him?

00:57.600 --> 00:58.510
I did.

01:00.100 --> 01:01.850
He's just been on my mind,
I guess.

Sorry.

01:03.430 --> 01:03.640
I'll be honest with you.

There's no cause of death yet.

Your father
was a Fed.

Was he disappointed
you didn't join the Mounties?

03:17.400 --> 03:18.650
No.

I was a cop.

04:00.280 --> 04:02.700
Dad made a codicil.
Dated yesterday.

04:02.740 --> 04:05.240
Your father amended his will

04:15.540 --> 04:17.090
What about the notebook?
Any ideas?

04:17.130 --> 04:17.840
I'm guessing it was
one of his scribblers.

04:19.130 --> 04:21.420
A little notepad
Dad used to write everything in.

04:21.460 --> 04:23.430
A little leather cover.
Do you know where it is?

I can't find it anywhere.
I've looked.

Did Dad seem
out of sorts lately?

She was always like this.

04:31.310 --> 04:33.440

This is our father's death.
Okay?

04:35.650 --> 04:36.940

it was suspicious.

around in CBS.

I was really hungry.

This is my father.

No.
He's terrifying.

Obviously Dad knew him.
But how?

for you now?

You don't have to be
so condescending, okay?

I'm just a little frazzled,
that's all.

in the basement.

09:07.880 --> 09:08.960
[Malachy]
38 Special.

09:09.000 --> 09:10.210
Used to be police issue.

09:11.170 --> 09:11.760
This was Dad's.

09:13.050 --> 09:15.590
[Jake] Obviously that's
not a leather book.

09:15.630 --> 09:17.140
Is this just an excuse,
you know,

09:17.180 --> 09:19.260
to prove to us that you're
searching for something?

09:19.300 --> 09:20.390
[Des]
Can I have it please?

09:20.430 --> 09:21.310
The gun, please?

09:22.270 --> 09:24.100
Tinny has one.
Come on, b'y.

09:25.020 --> 09:26.020
Yes?

09:26.060 --> 09:27.310
[phone rings]

09:28.980 --> 09:30.570
Rose?
Watcha got for me?

09:30.610 --> 09:32.530
[Rose] I called around to
a few places in Brigus.

09:32.570 --> 09:33.570
Local stores, what have you,

09:33.610 --> 09:35.030
to see if anyone had spotted

09:35.070 --> 09:36.700
anyone who looks
like your burglar.

09:36.740 --> 09:39.410
Gotta love a small town, huh?
What did you get?

09:39.450 --> 09:40.580
Well a guy at the local store

09:40.620 --> 09:41.740
said he saw
a creepy fella hanging out

09:41.790 --> 09:43.290
in a camper near Frog Marsh.

09:43.330 --> 09:43.370
Thanks Rose.

09:44.580 --> 09:46.040
Look into those
numbers on the photo.

09:46.080 --> 09:48.250
And see if it fits
into the Bennett world.

09:48.290 --> 09:49.630
I'll send you more as I go.

09:49.670 --> 09:50.540
Here's Jake.

09:51.210 --> 09:52.380
Yeah, what's up?

09:52.420 --> 09:54.760
Jake, please tell Leslie
I'm thinking of her.

09:54.800 --> 09:56.630
I'll tell her.
Cheers.

09:57.550 --> 09:58.930
Listen Dad,
what do you say?

09:58.970 --> 10:00.510
Let's go look around.
See if we can't find anything.

10:00.550 --> 10:01.600
Good idea.

10:01.640 --> 10:02.720
[Des]
And I'm going to find that book.

10:02.760 --> 10:05.640
It's a gift in lieu of flowers.

10:06.980 --> 10:09.270
Leslie. We have to get
over to the funeral home,

10:09.310 --> 10:09.650
to prepare for Dad's wake.

10:10.770 --> 10:12.400
Or do you want me
to do it all myself?

10:14.320 --> 10:15.070
I'm sorry.

10:16.030 --> 10:17.360
It's a bit of a stressful time.

10:17.400 --> 10:18.780
Don't worry about it.

10:18.820 --> 10:20.950
Jake was always into it
with his brother Christian.

10:20.990 --> 10:23.410
Ah, Jake is into it
with everyone, Hey b'y?

10:24.620 --> 10:25.750
[Jake]
Listen, go deal with the wake.

10:25.790 --> 10:27.000
And whatever you gotta do.

10:27.040 --> 10:28.620
We're here.
I'll keep you posted, alright?

10:28.670 --> 10:29.630
Okay.

10:30.630 --> 10:31.380
[smash]

10:32.290 --> 10:34.460
Okay.
So the leather book

10:34.500 --> 10:36.590
is not hiding in the vase.

10:37.340 --> 10:38.340
For the record.

10:41.260 --> 10:42.180
You're welcome.

10:57.190 --> 10:58.030
This is our guy.

10:58.070 --> 10:59.150
I hope Leslie's father

10:59.200 --> 11:00.320
is not involved
with anything too shady.

11:01.030 --> 11:02.070
I never knew the man.

11:02.120 --> 11:03.280
But I heard a few
rumors a while back.

11:03.990 --> 11:05.240
What kind of rumors?

11:05.290 --> 11:06.700
About a case, years ago.

11:06.750 --> 11:07.950
If I remember correctly,

11:08.000 --> 11:09.920
Mr. Bennett got put up
on the blocks for it.

11:10.330 --> 11:10.670
Oh yeah?

11:11.960 --> 11:13.580
Was he involved
in any kind of wrong-doing?

11:13.630 --> 11:15.550
[Mal] Drug related case. He
ended up shooting the perp.

11:16.670 --> 11:18.470
Back then, shooting
was a big deal.

11:18.510 --> 11:21.090
Us RNC guys didn't even
carry side arms.

11:21.130 --> 11:22.430
Well, the Feds did.

11:22.470 --> 11:23.430
I'll see if I can dig up
the rest of this info.

11:24.850 --> 11:26.430
Might be something there
to connected to all of this.

11:27.560 --> 11:29.350
Buddy had himself
a little fire going.

11:30.730 --> 11:31.690
[gunshot]

11:31.730 --> 11:33.480
[Jake]
Dad! Get down!

11:33.900 --> 11:34.860
[bang]

11:34.900 --> 11:35.900
[Malachy]
What the hell?

11:35.940 --> 11:36.900
[bang]

11:37.690 --> 11:38.740
What the hell was that?

11:38.780 --> 11:39.900
It's him.
Let's go!

11:50.210 --> 11:51.620
[tires squealing]

11:59.880 --> 12:01.300
How are you doing?
You okay?

12:02.180 --> 12:03.640
Deadly, Les.
Dad's dead.

12:03.680 --> 12:05.350
Looks like someone killed him.

12:05.390 --> 12:06.310
You are I are at each
other's throats.

12:07.810 --> 12:10.060
I'm sorry about all this.
The way we've been getting on.

12:10.100 --> 12:11.640
It's so stupid.

12:11.680 --> 12:15.190
I ah, I'm sorry we haven't had
much of a chance to reconnect.

12:15.730 --> 12:16.480
Or connect.

12:17.780 --> 12:19.610
It's not like things were crazy
good before.

12:19.650 --> 12:20.820
Yeah, I know.

12:23.910 --> 12:24.870
Good idea.

12:27.830 --> 12:29.240
Did you pick out this casket?

12:29.290 --> 12:31.120
- No.
- I don't know.

12:31.910 --> 12:33.120
This isn't right.

12:33.160 --> 12:36.170
Look, I'm just saying that,
I wish that --

12:37.210 --> 12:39.000
I'd really like
to start fresh.

12:39.800 --> 12:40.710
Yeah, me too.

12:41.340 --> 12:42.550
Moments like this.

12:42.590 --> 12:45.340
They teach us what's
really important in life.

12:46.680 --> 12:47.100
Leslie.

12:48.100 --> 12:49.680
Are you listening
to me at all?

12:49.720 --> 12:50.980
I'm pouring
my friggin’ heart out here.

12:52.180 --> 12:53.640
- What are you doing?
- Yeah, of course.

12:54.480 --> 12:56.020
Does this seem off to you?

12:56.060 --> 12:58.940
- Are you crazy? Stop it.
- Okay.

12:58.980 --> 13:00.820
I'm warning you Beth Ann.
Don't be at it now, okay?

13:00.860 --> 13:01.990
I'm checking something.

13:02.030 --> 13:03.700
What? To see if Dad
is really in there?

13:03.740 --> 13:05.200
- Because he is, okay? Stop it.
- I need --

13:05.240 --> 13:06.780
This is about Dad.

13:06.820 --> 13:09.330
And you refusing to actually
accept the fact that he's dead.

13:09.370 --> 13:10.490
Look, you've been warned.

13:10.540 --> 13:12.040
By the cop?
Or the arse sister?

13:12.620 --> 13:13.790
Ah! Beth Ann!

13:14.580 --> 13:15.580
[crash]

13:17.210 --> 13:18.460
What in the name of God?

13:23.420 --> 13:25.090
Watch it! I told you
to get this car fixed.

13:25.130 --> 13:26.380
The car is fine.

13:26.430 --> 13:27.680
Yeah, you're right.
It's obviously the driver.

13:28.800 --> 13:30.720
[Jake] Man, Brigus is a cute town, wha?

13:37.480 --> 13:38.560
C'mon! He's getting away.

13:43.530 --> 13:44.820
[car honks.
Tires squeal]

13:44.860 --> 13:45.860
Look out!

13:49.950 --> 13:51.240
[engine stalls]

13:52.740 --> 13:54.370
[engine trying to turn over]

13:54.960 --> 13:56.040
Just --

13:56.080 --> 13:57.080
Come on!

14:10.430 --> 14:12.310
Don't say a word.
Don't say a word.

14:12.350 --> 14:14.220
Obviously we've touched
a nerve with this guy.

14:14.270 --> 14:15.600
He's still here in Brigus.

14:15.640 --> 14:16.810
So he's looking for something.

14:16.850 --> 14:17.850
But what?

14:17.890 --> 14:19.310
I don't know what.
Let's find out.

14:23.820 --> 14:24.990
Engine turns over.

14:25.820 --> 14:27.450
- Come on.
- I Got it.

14:34.370 --> 14:35.290
[Beth Ann]
Oh my God.

14:35.330 --> 14:36.250
That's not Dad.

14:37.250 --> 14:39.040
I knew this wasn't
his casket.

14:39.960 --> 14:41.000
Someone switched them.

14:44.960 --> 14:46.460
What do you think buddy's after?

14:46.510 --> 14:48.510
Breaks into James Bennett's
house on the day that he died.

14:49.890 --> 14:51.930
I'd say there's unfinished
business between them.

14:51.970 --> 14:53.180
Yeah.
You think so?

14:54.010 --> 14:56.310
Oh man.
Look at this.

15:00.940 --> 15:02.980
Newspaper clippings
of James Bennett.

15:03.520 --> 15:04.570
And Leslie.

15:05.230 --> 15:06.780
Obviously this guy

15:06.820 --> 15:09.030
has some kind of vested
interested in Leslie's family.

15:09.070 --> 15:09.530
It's creepy.

15:10.450 --> 15:11.910
I need to get back in to town.

15:11.950 --> 15:13.280
There's a piece
here I need to connect.

15:15.790 --> 15:16.160
Oh, uh.

15:17.370 --> 15:18.910
You should check-in
with the girlfriend.

15:18.960 --> 15:20.750
You know?
I like the sound of that.

15:26.170 --> 15:26.880
[Leslie]
What are you doing?

15:28.260 --> 15:32.340
Uh, I was just making some
last minute adjustments.

15:33.050 --> 15:34.390
You little shagger.

15:34.430 --> 15:37.060
Whoa! Okay, now look!
I just --

15:37.100 --> 15:38.520
Alright.
Okay.

15:38.560 --> 15:39.770
I just wanted to--

15:40.850 --> 15:42.520
pay my last respects to...

15:43.110 --> 15:44.060
my Dad.

15:44.110 --> 15:45.110
Excuse me?

15:45.150 --> 15:46.280
James Bennett.
Your father?

15:47.030 --> 15:48.320
Well he's my father too.

15:55.370 --> 15:56.280
[Leslie] So.

15:56.330 --> 15:56.740
You're my half-brother?

15:57.950 --> 16:01.080
[Tony] Yeah, I think so.
I mean, yes, I am.

16:02.250 --> 16:04.000
So you're Leslie.
That means you must be--

16:04.040 --> 16:04.630
Beth Ann.

16:05.290 --> 16:07.090
Spill. Everything.

16:07.130 --> 16:08.340
[Tony]
I found out recently --

16:08.380 --> 16:11.260
like, real recently that Dad --

16:11.300 --> 16:12.260
Mr. Bennett.

16:12.300 --> 16:13.220
[Tony]
was my father.

16:13.260 --> 16:14.180
When?

16:14.220 --> 16:15.680
He reached out not too long ago.

16:15.720 --> 16:18.140
How did Dad know your mother?

16:18.180 --> 16:20.020
[Tony]
My mom and your dad

16:20.060 --> 16:21.480
had a relationship.

16:22.190 --> 16:23.600
Of a sexual nature?

16:23.640 --> 16:25.730
[Tony] Look, I'm not trying
to upset anyone here.

16:25.770 --> 16:28.030
Forgive us if we don't take
your immediate word for it.

16:29.360 --> 16:30.820
We're kind of dealing
with a lot around here.

16:31.570 --> 16:32.150
That's understandable.

16:33.320 --> 16:35.200
Do you think I can get
out of the cuffs?

16:35.240 --> 16:37.780
Why were you digging
around Dad's casket?

16:37.830 --> 16:38.910
I was--

16:38.950 --> 16:40.580
Looking for Dad's black book?

16:40.620 --> 16:42.000
[Leslie] Dad made an
amendment to his will

16:42.040 --> 16:43.370
just before
he died, to give it to you.

16:44.040 --> 16:45.630
Why would he do that?

16:45.670 --> 16:48.130
Something a father would want to
leave to a son, don't you think?

16:48.170 --> 16:49.630
But it's missing.

16:50.590 --> 16:52.130
And then you show up.

16:52.170 --> 16:53.180
Coincidence?

16:54.340 --> 16:58.760
Or something
that is not a coincidence?

16:58.810 --> 16:58.850
Leslie.

17:00.020 --> 17:00.520
We found your burglar
but he got away.

17:01.890 --> 17:03.600
The weird thing is that
he had a bunch of files

17:03.640 --> 17:04.770
and newspaper clippings

17:04.810 --> 17:06.400
about you and your family.
Is that -

17:06.440 --> 17:08.190
- [Leslie] Tony Bower?
- Yes.

17:08.230 --> 17:08.940
[Leslie]
Where are my manners?

17:09.860 --> 17:13.860
Tony, meet my boyfriend, Jake.

17:13.900 --> 17:16.700
Jake, this is my brother,
apparently.

17:17.490 --> 17:19.330
Boyfriend?
Are you--?

17:19.370 --> 17:21.160
Ah, finally. Yes, b'y!

17:21.200 --> 17:23.410
That's -- D'uh.

17:25.460 --> 17:26.540
Your brother?

17:38.090 --> 17:40.350
[Monica] How's the RNC's
top cadet doing today?

17:40.390 --> 17:43.350
Wish I had less of these to do.
But other than that-- best kind.

17:45.140 --> 17:48.900
Katrina, what about that special
assignment I gave you?

17:50.020 --> 17:51.070
Spying on my uncle?

17:52.280 --> 17:55.200
Um, haven't really
found anything so far.

17:55.240 --> 17:56.400
[Monica]
Nothing?

17:56.450 --> 17:58.160
Jake's not working
on any cases right now.

17:59.660 --> 18:02.830
Look,
you need to be able to separate

18:02.870 --> 18:04.580
the professional
from the personal.

18:04.620 --> 18:06.370
It's part of being a great cop.

18:06.410 --> 18:07.420
You wanna be a great cop, right?

18:08.210 --> 18:09.420
I'll see what I can find.

18:09.460 --> 18:10.380
Great.

18:25.980 --> 18:27.190
[Kathleen] Hey Walter.

18:27.230 --> 18:27.730
So,

18:28.650 --> 18:30.060
Did it work?
What happened?

18:30.100 --> 18:33.980
Yeah. Yeah. Kevin Crocker
is getting transferred.

18:35.150 --> 18:35.530
Thank God.

18:36.650 --> 18:39.070
But Kathleen, you know,
I gotta say.

18:40.200 --> 18:41.620
I don't exactly feel
right about this.

18:41.660 --> 18:44.950
Not only is it a slight
abuse of my new power.

18:44.990 --> 18:46.330
But taking Tinny's father away
from her,

18:46.370 --> 18:47.410
doesn't that bother you?

18:47.460 --> 18:48.540
Look, the farther away he is,

18:48.580 --> 18:50.080
the better for Tinny
and all of us.

18:50.130 --> 18:51.840
Right. Whatever you say.

18:51.880 --> 18:53.800
But, just so you know--

18:53.840 --> 18:56.010
He was not
very happy about it.

18:57.010 --> 18:58.630
And he does seem
like kind of a --

18:59.590 --> 19:01.800
revenge-oriented
kind of a guy.

19:01.850 --> 19:02.350
So--

19:03.180 --> 19:04.470
We better watch ourselves.

19:10.770 --> 19:12.560
I can't help but feel like
we're missing something here.

19:13.020 --> 19:14.110
You know?

19:14.150 --> 19:15.110
Des?

19:18.820 --> 19:19.740
Des!

19:19.780 --> 19:20.910
[Beth Ann]
Jake the charmer.

19:21.740 --> 19:22.990
The new boyfriend.

19:23.950 --> 19:24.950
Nice.

19:25.990 --> 19:26.740
Don't worry.

19:26.790 --> 19:26.830
Crooked arse ain't here.

19:28.410 --> 19:30.790
I always thought that she'd
end up with her usual type.

19:30.830 --> 19:32.630
Oh yeah?
What's her usual type?

19:32.670 --> 19:33.000
The corrupt mayor kind.

19:34.460 --> 19:36.710
And I must say, they're
not usually as cute as you.

19:36.750 --> 19:38.260
That might be the booze talking.

19:38.300 --> 19:41.050
I actually thought the mayor
was kind of a handsome fella.

19:41.840 --> 19:42.840
But you love her.

19:43.600 --> 19:44.850
I can tell these things.

19:49.140 --> 19:52.900
Maybe.
Maybe I, uh, maybe I do.

19:52.940 --> 19:53.900
Good.

19:53.940 --> 19:54.480
That makes me happy.

19:54.860 --> 19:56.150
Me too.

19:56.190 --> 19:57.280
I don't know what
the big deal about that book is.

19:58.440 --> 20:00.360
Dad only kept crap in it.
Grocery lists.

20:00.400 --> 20:01.650
Things like that.

20:01.700 --> 20:03.490
Well obviously it has some kind
of significance.

20:03.530 --> 20:05.450
Otherwise he wouldn't have
left it to Tony in his will.

20:06.490 --> 20:07.450
[Beth Ann]
Where's our new brother?

20:08.950 --> 20:11.870
If you mean Tony, I doubt very
much if he's our brother.

20:11.910 --> 20:12.920
He's handcuffed in the office.

20:12.960 --> 20:13.960
[Beth Ann]
Well even if he isn't,

20:14.000 --> 20:15.250
handcuffs?

20:15.290 --> 20:17.340
Yes b'y Leslie,
Why don't you lock us all up?

20:17.380 --> 20:18.710
Easier to handle that way.

20:21.010 --> 20:23.800
You can handcuff me if you want.
Just saying.

20:23.840 --> 20:26.510
I tell you, I'd love not to
sleep in this house tonight.

20:26.550 --> 20:27.510
You know.

20:27.560 --> 20:29.260
I got a place
that we can sleep.

20:29.310 --> 20:32.440
It's not very comfortable. But
at least we'll have each other.

20:32.480 --> 20:33.440
[Des]
Hey, hey! Can I come too?

20:35.020 --> 20:37.980
There's so much going on here.
I got a really bad headache.

20:38.020 --> 20:39.610
There's some really bad pain

20:39.650 --> 20:42.360
in my head, whole area.

20:42.400 --> 20:44.240
[Leslie] There's an
aspirin in Beth Ann's

20:44.280 --> 20:45.610
purse on the table.

20:45.660 --> 20:47.830
She's likely to have
the odd valium too.

20:49.910 --> 20:51.410
Yeah, ahhh.

20:52.460 --> 20:53.960
Oh, uh...

20:59.750 --> 21:00.880
Beth Ann.

21:02.760 --> 21:03.970
Hey. What do you got?

21:05.510 --> 21:08.140
A friend with the feds gave me
Mr. Bennett's police file.

21:09.180 --> 21:09.850
Anything in there?

21:10.680 --> 21:11.770
It says here James Bennett

21:11.810 --> 21:13.190
shot a man.
Almost killed him.

21:14.230 --> 21:15.690
A drug dealer they
were staking out

21:15.730 --> 21:17.150
who had thirty kilos
of coke.

21:17.190 --> 21:19.150
And supposedly over
a million dollars.

21:19.900 --> 21:20.860
Supposedly?

21:20.900 --> 21:22.070
The cash was never recovered.

21:22.110 --> 21:23.320
So what happened
to the million dollars?

21:23.360 --> 21:24.570
Good question.

21:24.610 --> 21:26.700
Did Mr. Bennett
squirrel it away somewhere?

21:26.740 --> 21:29.120
I've been through his expenses,
his bank records.

21:29.160 --> 21:30.450
If he did keep it,

21:30.490 --> 21:32.370
there's no record of him having
spent that money.

21:32.410 --> 21:33.460
And here's our drug dealer.

21:34.080 --> 21:34.330
Ross Keating.

21:35.370 --> 21:35.500
Yeah. That's him.
That's the guy.

21:36.830 --> 21:38.750
Ross Keating.
Sentenced to twenty five years.

21:40.210 --> 21:43.970
The numbers on the photo.
Rose, when was he released?

21:44.010 --> 21:47.390
Uh, according to this,
two weeks ago.

21:47.430 --> 21:48.050
[Malachy]
The number is a date.

21:49.390 --> 21:51.390
Bennett knew the date Keating
was getting out

21:51.430 --> 21:51.890
and figured he'd come after him.

21:53.100 --> 21:55.730
Keating had a wife.
And a stepson, Tony.

21:55.770 --> 21:58.440
Oh, let me guess. The wife's
maiden name was Bower?

21:58.480 --> 22:00.110
Tony Bower was
Keating's stepson.

22:00.150 --> 22:02.440
- They're here for the money.
- And maybe working together.

22:11.240 --> 22:11.450
[Des]
Watcha doing?

22:12.910 --> 22:16.370
Nothing. I just wanted to see
if he needed anything.

22:16.410 --> 22:19.000
But um,
I guess he's asleep.

22:19.040 --> 22:20.500
Why do you have Leslie's
handcuff keys?

22:20.540 --> 22:22.040
If he's my brother,

22:22.090 --> 22:24.130
he should be able to sleep
in his father's house uncuffed.

22:25.170 --> 22:26.260
You want him to be
your brother,

22:26.300 --> 22:26.760
don't you?

22:27.630 --> 22:29.390
I totally know the feeling.

22:29.430 --> 22:30.850
Jake and I are like--

22:31.720 --> 22:32.970
We're like, almost brothers.

22:33.520 --> 22:34.890
But not quite.

22:34.930 --> 22:37.140
I guess I just wanted
to make a connection with him.

22:37.190 --> 22:37.890
You know.

22:39.270 --> 22:41.400
Find a piece of Dad in him,
now that he's gone.

22:41.440 --> 22:43.400
Is that why you took
your dad's leather book?

22:43.440 --> 22:44.690
You went through my purse?

22:44.730 --> 22:46.940
No, no.
Well, yes. I'm sorry.

22:46.990 --> 22:48.860
I knocked it open.
But why do you have this?

22:48.900 --> 22:50.410
[Des]
And why is that broken?

22:51.450 --> 22:52.990
No! No! No!

22:55.790 --> 22:56.870
Tony!

22:56.910 --> 22:58.710
Don't say a word.
And don't move, okay?

22:58.750 --> 23:00.170
I don't want to hurt you,
but I will.

23:00.210 --> 23:01.580
I knew you weren't
my brother.

23:01.630 --> 23:02.750
[Tony]
Undo the cuffs.

23:06.880 --> 23:07.840
Take them.

23:10.640 --> 23:11.760
Cuff yourself to the chair.

23:18.890 --> 23:20.230
I'm sorry I have to do this.

23:22.730 --> 23:23.650
Try not to take it personally.

23:24.860 --> 23:26.440
But your father,
he wanted me to have this.

23:26.480 --> 23:27.440
It's mine.

23:34.830 --> 23:36.660
[Leslie] One of the benefits
of being around the bay Jake?

23:38.250 --> 23:40.750
Is that there are some spots
where your phone doesn't work.

23:42.250 --> 23:43.840
Yeah. I should probably
just go with it.

23:47.710 --> 23:50.590
When did you
move out here, anyway?

23:51.550 --> 23:52.680
When we were kids.

23:53.800 --> 23:54.760
We grew up in town though.

23:55.260 --> 23:56.640
Mount Pearl.

23:56.680 --> 23:58.930
I hate to tell you,
but Mount Pearl is so not town.

23:59.520 --> 24:00.940
Shut up.

24:00.980 --> 24:01.940
It's not.

24:03.060 --> 24:04.520
We moved out
when we were teens.

24:05.110 --> 24:06.150
Dad moved us.

24:06.190 --> 24:06.820
Why?

24:07.610 --> 24:09.110
He took early retirement.

24:10.740 --> 24:12.320
Beth Ann never really adjusted.

24:12.990 --> 24:14.120
Mom moved away.

24:14.700 --> 24:15.870
We grew apart.

24:19.040 --> 24:20.660
I'm sorry that you have
to deal with all this.

24:20.710 --> 24:21.620
[phone rings]

24:21.660 --> 24:24.750
Look at that.
Mine's fine.

24:24.790 --> 24:25.880
Hilarious.

24:27.420 --> 24:28.420
Bennett.

24:28.460 --> 24:29.880
Those tests on you dad.

24:29.920 --> 24:31.300
I checked with the fed's files.

24:31.920 --> 24:31.970
What'd you find?

24:33.260 --> 24:34.510
[Hood] You were right.
He was poisoned.

24:35.680 --> 24:38.470
He was injected
with potassium chloride.

24:38.510 --> 24:39.310
It induces heart attacks.

24:40.930 --> 24:43.480
And is naked on most tox screens
unless you're looking for it.

24:44.190 --> 24:44.860
Oh my God.

24:45.610 --> 24:46.560
[Hood] I'm sorry.

24:46.610 --> 24:47.730
What's going on?

24:48.480 --> 24:49.440
It's no longer a theory.

24:50.900 --> 24:52.240
God I hate it when I'm
right about this stuff, Jake.

24:53.320 --> 24:54.780
What are you talking about?
Tell me.

24:56.280 --> 24:56.990
My dad was murdered.

24:58.080 --> 24:59.700
And I need to find out
who did it.

25:04.580 --> 25:06.130
[Crocker] Did Jake do this?

25:06.170 --> 25:08.800
Did your uncle put that moron
lawyer up to transferring me?

25:08.840 --> 25:09.880
I don't know.

25:09.920 --> 25:11.880
As far as I know,
Jake has no idea.

25:13.010 --> 25:14.430
He doesn't know
that you're my dad.

25:16.510 --> 25:18.140
Must be your mother's
handiwork then.

25:19.010 --> 25:20.220
[Tinny]
Yeah. Could be.

25:20.270 --> 25:22.310
[laughs]

25:22.350 --> 25:24.560
Well, I can't say I blame her.

25:24.600 --> 25:26.690
She's a smart cookie,
your mother. She always was.

25:27.270 --> 25:28.230
Just like you.

25:30.730 --> 25:32.190
I would say that, um.

25:34.650 --> 25:36.610
I've started to enjoy
us getting to know each other.

25:36.660 --> 25:37.700
Getting to know you.

25:39.240 --> 25:42.040
From what I see you are a nice,
beautiful, good person.

25:42.080 --> 25:42.950
I'm very proud of you.

25:44.120 --> 25:45.750
Not that that should mean
anything to you.

25:45.790 --> 25:46.880
It does.

25:48.330 --> 25:50.340
It's likely not a bad thing
we never knew each other.

25:50.750 --> 25:52.050
How so?

25:52.090 --> 25:53.670
Well I'm just saying,
it's probably a good thing

25:53.710 --> 25:55.590
your mother kept us a secret
from each other until now.

25:56.630 --> 25:58.300
It's not really fair
to say that.

25:58.340 --> 26:01.430
I mean, we don't know what could
have happened.

26:01.470 --> 26:03.020
No. We don't.

26:03.890 --> 26:05.600
But honestly, Tinny, I'm --

26:07.060 --> 26:10.360
Was-- I was a bad person,

26:10.400 --> 26:13.820
who has done in my past
some very bad things.

26:15.610 --> 26:16.740
I don't care.

26:17.990 --> 26:19.320
I'm gonna miss you.

26:20.490 --> 26:21.830
Me too. I will.

26:25.660 --> 26:28.210
So, what do you think
your uncle would do

26:28.250 --> 26:29.830
if he knew I was your father?

26:31.880 --> 26:33.050
He'd want to kill me,
wouldn't he?

26:34.090 --> 26:36.880
Yeah.
He'd probably try to. Why?

26:37.590 --> 26:38.880
Oh, it's no reason.

26:38.930 --> 26:40.760
[guard] Crocker.
Time's up.

26:41.350 --> 26:42.100
I gotta go.

26:43.180 --> 26:44.520
Listen,
I'm not leaving for a bit.

26:44.560 --> 26:46.020
Like a week, so...

26:46.850 --> 26:47.890
We'll do this again, yeah?

26:55.440 --> 26:57.110
What the hell was that?

26:58.740 --> 26:59.910
[Leslie] I knew Tony wasn't my brother.

27:01.030 --> 27:03.530
Where's Beth Ann?
Has anyone seen her?

27:03.580 --> 27:06.290
No. But we know who our mystery
man is. Ross Keating.

27:06.330 --> 27:07.620
[Mal]
A missing million dollars.

27:07.660 --> 27:09.540
And a twenty five year
grudge against your dad.

27:09.580 --> 27:11.420
Sounds like a motive
for murder to me.

27:11.460 --> 27:13.590
I'm guessing the million dollars
was never recovered, right?

27:14.550 --> 27:15.670
And your father must have known

27:15.710 --> 27:17.420
that Keating was getting
out of jail.

27:17.470 --> 27:19.220
So I say,
Tony and Keating--

27:19.260 --> 27:20.340
They could have killed Dad
for the cash.

27:21.720 --> 27:23.970
I can't believe Dad
would have taken that money.

27:24.010 --> 27:25.390
[Jake] Let's go talk to Tony.
Have a conversation.

27:26.560 --> 27:28.310
Maybe he can shed
some light on things.

27:28.350 --> 27:29.390
[thump]

27:29.440 --> 27:30.560
Oh no.

27:31.020 --> 27:31.900
Beth Ann?

27:34.770 --> 27:35.820
Oh my God!

27:35.860 --> 27:36.150
Des! What happened?

27:37.440 --> 27:39.450
Weird. That was the best
sleep I had in weeks.

27:39.490 --> 27:40.820
[Leslie]
Are you okay?

27:40.860 --> 27:43.280
Ow, b'y!
Yes, I'm fine.

27:43.320 --> 27:44.240
[Beth Ann]
Tony.

27:44.280 --> 27:45.830
He escaped.

27:45.870 --> 27:48.750
He said he was sorry for what
he had to do and he took off.

27:48.790 --> 27:50.330
- He took the book.
- The book?

27:50.370 --> 27:51.670
What?
Where did he find it?

27:51.710 --> 27:53.630
It was in Beth Ann's purse.

27:55.880 --> 27:57.840
You had it all this time.
And you didn't tell us?

27:57.880 --> 27:59.260
I'm sorry, okay?

27:59.300 --> 28:00.380
You were just so fixated on it.

28:01.260 --> 28:02.840
I couldn't bear to read it.

28:02.890 --> 28:04.140
I thought we would
find something in it

28:04.180 --> 28:06.260
that would hurt
our memory of Dad.

28:06.310 --> 28:07.890
You do know
that I could have you arrested

28:07.930 --> 28:09.730
for obstructing an
investigation, don't you?

28:09.770 --> 28:10.730
[Beth Ann]
You could what?

28:10.770 --> 28:11.770
I'm your sister.

28:11.810 --> 28:12.770
[Jake] Leslie.

28:12.810 --> 28:13.900
Come on.
Let's just find Tony.

28:13.940 --> 28:14.860
[phone rings]

28:14.900 --> 28:16.400
Find him yourself
you little shit.

28:17.980 --> 28:18.900
[Jake] Hello?

28:18.940 --> 28:20.070
Jake Doyle.

28:20.110 --> 28:22.450
Man is this a phone call
I'm gonna enjoy.

28:22.490 --> 28:24.530
Who is this? I'm kind of in
the middle of something.

28:24.570 --> 28:26.700
You're damned right you're
in the middle of something.

28:26.740 --> 28:29.830
A great big something, partner.

28:30.580 --> 28:30.960
Kevin Crocker.

28:31.580 --> 28:33.000
What are you, like,

28:33.040 --> 28:35.080
lonely for old friends
or something? What's going on?

28:35.130 --> 28:36.250
Do you know --

28:36.290 --> 28:38.800
And I really want
to share this with you --

28:38.840 --> 28:40.300
Do you know that
I slept

28:40.340 --> 28:42.880
with your sister.
Did you hear me Jake?

28:43.630 --> 28:45.430
I banged your sister,

28:46.050 --> 28:48.720
over and over.

28:48.760 --> 28:50.520
If you ever speak with that tone

28:50.560 --> 28:52.680
about any of my family
members again,

28:52.730 --> 28:54.020
I swear
you will live to regret it.

28:55.350 --> 28:57.440
Now, pal, I really need you
to stay calm here.

28:57.480 --> 28:59.190
Because I'm trying
to get to the best part.

28:59.230 --> 29:00.360
I don't want to listen
to anything more

29:00.400 --> 29:01.650
that you have to say.

29:01.690 --> 29:03.950
You see, your sister
and that moron lawyer,

29:03.990 --> 29:05.280
they pulled a little move

29:05.320 --> 29:06.820
to get me transferred
to Vancouver.

29:06.870 --> 29:07.870
[click]

29:09.080 --> 29:10.830
I ain't giving up
that easy Jake.

29:11.290 --> 29:12.250
Trust me.

29:14.750 --> 29:16.210
- What was that about?
- Nothing.

29:16.250 --> 29:17.210
[tires screeching]

29:17.250 --> 29:18.550
Did you hear that?
Outside?

29:19.130 --> 29:20.170
[Jake]
A car?

29:20.210 --> 29:21.550
Des. Head over
to Keating’s okay?

29:21.590 --> 29:22.800
Stake the place out.

29:22.840 --> 29:25.220
Hopefully he's stupid enough
to go back there.

29:25.260 --> 29:26.510
- I'll go with you.
- Yeah.

29:26.550 --> 29:27.550
Hey.

29:28.390 --> 29:29.350
Yeah.

29:33.560 --> 29:34.480
[Malachy]
No Des.

29:34.520 --> 29:36.400
Tony is not Leslie's brother.

29:37.020 --> 29:38.190
Hmmm.

29:38.230 --> 29:39.520
And Jake?

29:39.570 --> 29:40.900
Is not your brother.

29:41.980 --> 29:42.900
And Tony and Keating?

29:42.940 --> 29:44.610
Tony is Keating's stepson.

29:44.650 --> 29:45.610
Hmmm.

29:48.070 --> 29:49.330
And Jake?

29:49.370 --> 29:50.540
Is not your brother.

29:51.410 --> 29:52.330
I got ya.

29:52.950 --> 29:53.960
I got you loud.

29:56.540 --> 29:57.460
And you?

29:57.500 --> 29:58.540
Quiet now, son.

29:58.580 --> 29:59.710
Son?

30:02.630 --> 30:05.510
We need to find Tony. We need
to figure out what's going on.

30:05.550 --> 30:07.090
Okay. We will. I promise.

30:07.140 --> 30:09.260
[ring]

30:10.470 --> 30:11.850
Hello?

30:11.890 --> 30:13.970
[Keating] I grabbed your
sister outside your house.

30:14.020 --> 30:14.230
And as for your father.

30:15.560 --> 30:17.730
I've torn this town apart
looking for his money.

30:17.770 --> 30:18.190
My money.

30:19.360 --> 30:20.940
Where is it?
I know he didn't spend it.

30:21.520 --> 30:22.570
It's Keating.

30:23.360 --> 30:23.400
Get it.

30:24.780 --> 30:27.200
Or your sister will be
joining your dead father.

30:30.070 --> 30:32.160
He's gonna kill Beth Ann
if we don't get him the money.

30:36.250 --> 30:38.330
[Jake] We need evidence.
Anything that will help us.

30:38.370 --> 30:38.500
How are we gonna
find the money?

30:40.130 --> 30:42.840
If Keating killed Dad, God knows
what he's gonna do to Beth Ann.

30:42.880 --> 30:44.210
We just gotta
get that book from Tony.

30:45.380 --> 30:47.300
The key to everything
must be in there.

30:47.340 --> 30:49.220
If Tony hasn't
given it to Keating.

30:49.260 --> 30:50.890
Maybe they're not
working together.

30:50.930 --> 30:51.850
Either way,
We find Tony.

30:52.560 --> 30:54.010
We get our answers.

30:54.060 --> 30:55.390
Let's scour the place.

30:55.430 --> 30:56.850
There might have been
something we missed.

31:02.230 --> 31:03.480
My dad wasn't dirty Jake.

31:04.400 --> 31:06.650
I know it.
He was like me.

31:06.690 --> 31:09.610
He was a good cop.
He was a good father.

31:09.660 --> 31:11.030
[Jake] I trust your
gut on these things.

31:11.660 --> 31:12.700
We'll prove it.

31:17.750 --> 31:18.750
Here we go.

31:20.370 --> 31:21.500
What are the odds?

31:33.550 --> 31:34.510
Ugh!

31:34.560 --> 31:35.890
[Malachy]
What are you looking for?

31:35.930 --> 31:37.430
I hope you came back here
for a good reason.

31:37.850 --> 31:38.890
Nothing.

31:39.560 --> 31:39.730
Nothing man.

31:40.980 --> 31:42.270
How'd you guys know
I'd end up back here?

31:42.310 --> 31:43.820
Ah, because Keating
is your stepfather. There.

31:45.270 --> 31:47.110
[Malachy] I gotta say,
I'm not very pleased with you

31:47.150 --> 31:50.110
for holding that set of scissors
under Beth Ann's throat.

31:50.150 --> 31:52.240
Yeah, yeah. Or the smack
to the back of my head.

31:52.280 --> 31:53.780
Or was it the front of my head?
Or both?

31:53.820 --> 31:55.370
Okay, look.
I can explain, okay?

31:55.410 --> 31:56.330
[Malachy] Good.

31:59.250 --> 32:00.160
Oooh!

32:00.210 --> 32:01.170
Come on.

32:03.920 --> 32:05.250
[Tony] Keating, my stepfather?

32:05.290 --> 32:06.500
Him going to prison
was the best thing

32:06.550 --> 32:08.260
that could have happened to me.
And my mom.

32:08.300 --> 32:10.130
Keating has Beth Ann
and he wants his money.

32:10.170 --> 32:11.720
Is he capable
of hurting her?

32:11.760 --> 32:12.090
Yeah.
Unfortunately he is.

32:13.430 --> 32:15.680
Look. I never meant
for any of this to happen.

32:15.720 --> 32:17.850
[Jake] We're going to need
to hear the entire story.

32:17.890 --> 32:18.470
From the start.

32:19.930 --> 32:21.730
Keating hid the money before
your father caught him.

32:23.190 --> 32:25.400
After he went to jail,
he made contact with Bennett.

32:25.440 --> 32:26.820
And he made

32:26.860 --> 32:27.650
Mr. Bennett hold onto the money
until he got out.

32:29.110 --> 32:32.200
Why did Keating want Mr. Bennett
to hold onto the money?

32:32.240 --> 32:32.910
The feds were getting
close to the stash.

32:33.990 --> 32:35.070
So he gets a cop
to hold it for him?

32:35.870 --> 32:36.030
[Leslie]
You're lying.

32:37.200 --> 32:38.910
My father wouldn't
help a drug dealer.

32:38.950 --> 32:40.250
He would if he did it
to protect you.

32:41.160 --> 32:42.080
What are you
talking about?

32:42.790 --> 32:43.000
Keating had friends.

32:44.250 --> 32:45.960
He threatened
to kill you and your sister

32:46.000 --> 32:46.420
if your dad didn't do it.

32:47.710 --> 32:49.800
When was the last time you heard
from my father?

32:49.840 --> 32:51.260
He contacted me a while back.

32:51.300 --> 32:53.430
Told me that Keating was
getting out of jail.

32:53.470 --> 32:55.010
He told me this whole story.

32:55.050 --> 32:57.550
He said that he wanted me
to have the money instead.

32:57.600 --> 32:59.140
Why would James Bennett
want you to have the money?

33:00.180 --> 33:01.730
Keating left my mom
on the hook

33:01.770 --> 33:03.810
for some pretty big debts
with some pretty bad people.

33:03.850 --> 33:05.190
It took us our whole lives
to pay them off.

33:05.940 --> 33:06.730
I guess your mom died.

33:07.900 --> 33:08.940
Yeah.
And your father wanted to help.

33:09.900 --> 33:11.240
He's a good man.
You're lucky.

33:12.900 --> 33:14.280
[Jake]
Okay, explain one thing.

33:14.320 --> 33:15.700
Why are you still here?

33:15.740 --> 33:17.450
I mean, why haven't you left
town with the cash?

33:17.490 --> 33:19.120
The book. It's empty.
There's nothing in it.

33:19.160 --> 33:20.580
I thought I was missing
something.

33:20.620 --> 33:21.870
So that's why
I went over to Keating.

33:21.910 --> 33:22.580
I thought
he would know something.

33:23.540 --> 33:24.790
Did you find anything in there?

33:24.830 --> 33:27.290
[Des]
Oh, I found this in here.

33:27.330 --> 33:28.380
But the pages are all blank.

33:28.420 --> 33:29.920
But it's really

33:29.960 --> 33:30.710
good quality leather though.

33:32.130 --> 33:35.590
That says: Black Cemetery.
Franne Lee, or something.

33:36.720 --> 33:37.640
Maybe it's a clue.

33:37.680 --> 33:39.140
Black cemetery.

33:40.970 --> 33:42.520
Black could be short for
Protestant.

33:42.560 --> 33:43.430
We are around the bay.

33:44.100 --> 33:45.480
Anglican cemetery.

33:45.520 --> 33:46.980
I think I know
where the money is.

33:47.020 --> 33:48.520
Listen.
Call Keating.

33:48.560 --> 33:51.530
Tell him he's got to meet us
there at the cemetery in about--

33:52.230 --> 33:53.280
I dunno, ten minutes.

33:53.320 --> 33:55.030
Dad, you should probably
stay with Des.

33:55.070 --> 33:57.490
He's been struck in
the head two times today.

33:57.530 --> 33:58.820
He's not really with it.

33:58.870 --> 33:59.830
Sorry.

34:00.660 --> 34:01.660
[Keating] Hello?

34:01.700 --> 34:04.460
Keating.
I think I got your money.

34:05.160 --> 34:06.290
Don't hurt Beth Ann.

34:16.550 --> 34:18.510
[Jake] There it
is. Franne Lee.

34:19.140 --> 34:19.970
That's the one.

34:20.010 --> 34:20.050
I hope so.

34:21.720 --> 34:24.930
Otherwise you're just digging
up some poor shagger's grave.

34:33.320 --> 34:34.400
I think I got it.

34:34.440 --> 34:35.570
Thank God.
I thought we were going

34:35.610 --> 34:36.900
to have to get
down to the coffin.

34:37.820 --> 34:39.030
[Keating]
Not so fast.

34:39.660 --> 34:40.700
Stop right there.

34:41.330 --> 34:42.200
Drop your weapon.

34:42.740 --> 34:43.620
Toss it out.

34:45.040 --> 34:45.910
Now.

34:47.250 --> 34:49.210
You going to kill me
like you killed my father?

34:49.250 --> 34:50.580
You wanna deal
with that right now?

34:50.630 --> 34:52.250
While I got a gun
to your sister's head?

34:58.430 --> 34:59.550
Good.

35:00.390 --> 35:01.430
You.

35:01.470 --> 35:02.640
Dig up the box.

35:02.680 --> 35:03.890
All right b'y.

35:03.930 --> 35:05.430
You'll pay
for killing my father.

35:05.470 --> 35:08.600
Your father left me rotting
in a jail cell for twenty years.

35:08.640 --> 35:10.560
And you killed him
for doing his job?

35:10.600 --> 35:12.270
No. I killed him because
he wouldn't tell me

35:12.310 --> 35:13.690
where he stashed
the money.

35:14.690 --> 35:15.900
I enjoyed it.

35:16.780 --> 35:18.700
Because he ruined my life.

35:24.450 --> 35:25.370
Open it.

35:25.410 --> 35:26.790
Any sudden moves.

35:27.660 --> 35:29.250
And she dies first.

35:29.290 --> 35:30.460
Just calm down, alright?

35:31.040 --> 35:32.130
[clang]

35:32.170 --> 35:33.340
[clang]

35:41.470 --> 35:43.010
Pull all the money out
so I know you're not

35:43.050 --> 35:44.720
stashing any of it.

35:45.810 --> 35:46.810
It's all here.

35:46.850 --> 35:47.600
Good.

35:48.730 --> 35:52.060
Now I'm afraid can't let
any of you live.

35:52.100 --> 35:53.400
[Tony] Once an arse,
always an arse!

35:53.440 --> 35:55.440
Tony! Umph!

35:58.440 --> 35:59.900
Arrgh!

35:59.950 --> 36:00.950
[gunshot]

36:00.990 --> 36:01.910
Beth Ann!

36:03.620 --> 36:04.450
[gunshot]

36:05.120 --> 36:06.040
Are you all right?

36:06.080 --> 36:06.950
I got him!

36:07.830 --> 36:10.040
I'm fine.
Go! Get the jerk!

36:26.430 --> 36:26.470
[Keating] Nice try.

36:28.100 --> 36:29.930
But I've been hunting out here
for the last two months now.

36:31.350 --> 36:33.690
I've been doing that a lot
longer than you, scumbag.

36:34.310 --> 36:35.270
Now drop it.

36:35.310 --> 36:36.230
No.

36:36.270 --> 36:37.780
I'm not going back to jail.

36:38.820 --> 36:39.860
End this.

36:39.900 --> 36:41.400
You killed my father.

36:42.950 --> 36:44.450
Leslie, just hold on.

36:44.490 --> 36:45.700
I'm sorry.

36:45.740 --> 36:47.660
I am, but I know the best
punishment for you.

36:47.700 --> 36:48.660
[Keating] Do it.

36:48.700 --> 36:50.040
I'll kill this one as well.

36:50.830 --> 36:51.750
[Jake] Leslie!

36:51.790 --> 36:52.710
[bang]

36:54.290 --> 36:56.380
Jail is where you're gonna
suffer worse Keating.

36:56.420 --> 36:59.960
No, my arm.

37:00.550 --> 37:01.420
Nice shooting.

37:02.630 --> 37:04.220
I was aiming for his leg.

37:08.220 --> 37:10.020
[Jake] So the police
are charging Keating

37:10.060 --> 37:11.430
for the murder of your father.

37:11.480 --> 37:13.480
And the attempted murder of us.

37:13.520 --> 37:15.480
So he'll be gone away
for a long time.

37:16.810 --> 37:18.900
Yeah. He can rot in there
as far as I'm concerned.

37:18.940 --> 37:20.530
There's more interesting news.

37:20.570 --> 37:20.780
They recovered the money.

37:22.190 --> 37:24.360
All four hundred and fifty
thousand dollars of it.

37:24.400 --> 37:25.570
Four hundred
and fifty thousand?

37:25.610 --> 37:27.030
I thought it was supposed
to be a million.

37:27.070 --> 37:28.740
Yeah, I'm pretty sure it is.

37:28.780 --> 37:31.330
And I'm also pretty sure I know
where the rest of it is stashed.

37:32.290 --> 37:33.710
Anyone want to go check it out?

37:37.000 --> 37:38.040
[Jake] There.

37:40.750 --> 37:42.300
[Leslie]
There was two boxes.

37:42.340 --> 37:43.920
Hey, you can't do that.

37:43.970 --> 37:45.130
Walk away, sir.

37:45.840 --> 37:46.640
I can't believe it.

37:47.590 --> 37:48.510
[Tony]
Well, is it in there?

37:48.550 --> 37:49.430
[clang]

37:59.480 --> 38:00.820
[Jake]
There's two envelopes.

38:01.780 --> 38:02.990
One for each of you.

38:07.740 --> 38:07.950
[Beth Ann]
It's from Dad.

38:09.330 --> 38:13.370
You are my favorite daughter.
Be good to Leslie.

38:14.250 --> 38:15.540
Nice Dad.

38:17.330 --> 38:21.300
You are my favorite daughter.
Be good to Beth Ann.

38:21.340 --> 38:22.420
Cute Dad.

38:22.460 --> 38:23.840
[Leslie]
P.S.

38:23.880 --> 38:25.590
The money is for Tony.

38:25.630 --> 38:27.300
He suffered enough
because of Keating.

38:28.180 --> 38:29.800
Please let him have a life.

38:29.840 --> 38:31.220
I told you your father --
he was a good man.

38:32.180 --> 38:32.890
You do what you want with this.

38:33.970 --> 38:35.600
I don't even want
the money anymore.

38:36.770 --> 38:37.730
Les.

38:37.770 --> 38:38.900
Tony didn't do anything.

38:39.730 --> 38:40.690
And it's Dad's dying wish.

38:42.110 --> 38:44.320
I'll support whatever you
decide. A hundred percent.

38:45.650 --> 38:46.650
Take it.

38:46.700 --> 38:47.610
[Tony]
It's too bad.

38:47.650 --> 38:49.070
I kinda wish I was your brother.

38:49.110 --> 38:49.740
Let's not get ahead
of ourselves.

38:51.370 --> 38:53.790
There's nothing wrong with not
being siblings too, you know.

38:53.830 --> 38:54.870
[phone rings]

38:54.910 --> 38:56.410
I should take this.

38:59.330 --> 39:00.380
Yeah?

39:00.420 --> 39:02.670
Do not hang up on me
this time, fella.

39:02.710 --> 39:03.380
Kevin Crocker.

39:04.460 --> 39:05.880
What the hell
do you want anyway?

39:05.920 --> 39:07.510
I need a major favor.

39:07.550 --> 39:09.470
Ha, ha.
Are you out of your mind?

39:09.510 --> 39:11.260
First off,
I want you to know

39:11.300 --> 39:13.470
that I am your niece's father.

39:14.640 --> 39:16.680
Can you repeat
what you just said to me?

39:16.720 --> 39:20.480
I had sex with your sister
and knocked her up.

39:20.520 --> 39:22.020
She had Katarina.

39:22.060 --> 39:24.400
Or Katrina. Or whatever
the hell her name is.

39:24.440 --> 39:25.610
Her name is Tinny.

39:25.650 --> 39:26.900
Tinny. Right.

39:26.940 --> 39:28.900
And you know.
I never cared one bit about it.

39:28.950 --> 39:30.490
What do you think
about that, partner?

39:30.530 --> 39:31.870
Isn't that incredible?

39:32.780 --> 39:33.910
Jake.
What's wrong?

39:35.080 --> 39:36.200
So, what.
You got nothing to say?

39:37.620 --> 39:41.540
Isn't this amazing huh?
Us being family like this?

39:42.210 --> 39:43.670
You listen to me.

39:43.710 --> 39:46.380
You keep your calendar nice
and clear for the next hour.

39:46.420 --> 39:47.380
Do you understand that?

39:47.420 --> 39:48.420
Nice and clear.

39:48.470 --> 39:50.180
There's no worries
there old pal.

39:52.340 --> 39:53.600
Yeah.
That oughta do it.

39:55.060 --> 39:55.970
What is it?

39:56.010 --> 39:57.560
[Jake]
Something came up.

39:57.600 --> 39:58.890
And I gotta get back to town.

39:58.930 --> 40:00.770
It's a long drive.
And I only got an hour, so...

40:00.810 --> 40:01.850
Jake, where are you going?

40:01.900 --> 40:02.860
It's nothing.

40:04.110 --> 40:06.230
I'll be here tomorrow,
for the wake. So...

40:07.860 --> 40:08.860
See ya.

40:15.030 --> 40:16.790
What do you say
we split a bottle of wine?

40:25.960 --> 40:27.000
[buzz]

40:38.060 --> 40:40.600
Well I gotta say partner.
I'm surprised to see ya.

40:40.640 --> 40:41.850
After visiting hours.

40:41.890 --> 40:43.440
Must have called in
a big favor on that one.

40:43.480 --> 40:45.810
But then you do have friends
in high places, don't you?

40:45.860 --> 40:47.320
- Shut up.
- Hey now.

40:47.360 --> 40:49.480
I said shut up.

40:49.530 --> 40:51.240
I see you've had some time
to think about the fact

40:51.280 --> 40:53.490
that I'm your little
Tinny's father.

40:53.530 --> 40:56.320
Which means
that we are family.

40:56.370 --> 40:58.330
And you know,
I always wanted to be

40:58.370 --> 40:59.450
part of your family,
Jake.

40:59.910 --> 41:01.080
Always.

41:01.120 --> 41:03.710
You're no one's family,
you piece of shit.

41:04.920 --> 41:06.000
Your niece.

41:06.540 --> 41:07.670
My daughter.

41:08.590 --> 41:09.760
Family.

41:11.420 --> 41:13.880
For the record.
I never even wanted her.

41:13.930 --> 41:15.510
I told Kathleen
to get rid of her

41:15.550 --> 41:18.310
when I found out she was
preggers twenty years ago.

41:22.020 --> 41:23.180
You what?

41:23.230 --> 41:25.190
And now? Man,
I can't get rid of the brat.

41:25.230 --> 41:26.480
She won't stop coming here
to visit me.

41:26.520 --> 41:27.730
She's driving me crazy.

41:27.770 --> 41:29.190
Tinny's been here
to see you?

41:29.230 --> 41:32.740
God yes.
I gotta say something.

41:32.780 --> 41:35.030
She's not much to look at,
is she?

41:35.070 --> 41:36.120
You think this glass here
is gonna protect you?

41:37.570 --> 41:42.160
I dunno. I seem to recall
that this is all pretty old.

41:42.200 --> 41:43.540
There's no money
to repair them.

41:43.580 --> 41:45.250
In fact this one
even has a crack.

41:45.290 --> 41:46.250
You can see it.

41:46.960 --> 41:48.040
It's right here.

41:49.800 --> 41:50.840
Come on over Jake.

41:51.960 --> 41:53.880
You look like
you wanna get closer.

41:53.920 --> 41:56.050
We can have
a heart to heart

41:56.090 --> 41:59.220
about what a loser
my daughter is.

42:07.150 --> 42:08.230
[crash]

42:11.900 --> 42:14.240
Here we go!

42:14.280 --> 42:15.530
Arrgh!

42:16.110 --> 42:17.280
Oh, that's it

42:17.320 --> 42:18.910
Jake buddy!

42:18.950 --> 42:19.910
Ughh!

42:19.950 --> 42:21.410
Duke it up good!

42:21.450 --> 42:22.370
Ohhh!

42:22.830 --> 42:23.620
Ughh!

42:24.040 --> 42:24.910
Oooh!

42:26.000 --> 42:26.790
Ughhh!

42:27.370 --> 42:28.710
Heh, heh, heh.
