WEBVTT

00:03.817 --> 00:06.430
Dude, look at the lizard
running from the snakes!

00:06.431 --> 00:07.965
- It's everything.
- No, I...

00:07.966 --> 00:09.566
- No, I can't watch this.
- No, you have to.

00:09.567 --> 00:11.247
- No, I'm not...
- The end's the best part.

00:11.248 --> 00:13.181
Do you have any idea what
they're talking about?

00:13.182 --> 00:14.405
Not a clue.

00:14.406 --> 00:16.306
- Oh, my God, you're so annoying.
- No!

00:16.308 --> 00:19.410
Uh, Mom, is it Caribbean Day at work?

00:19.411 --> 00:21.245
It's 38 degrees outside.

00:21.246 --> 00:23.981
Yes, well, it's 84
degrees in Singapore, so...

00:23.982 --> 00:26.083
Oh, right. The Singapore Interchange.

00:26.084 --> 00:27.418
What, you're leaving today?

00:27.419 --> 00:29.320
Yeah, I told you that.

00:29.321 --> 00:31.722
- No. You said it was a maybe.
- Oh.

00:31.723 --> 00:35.659
Well, now it's a strong tentative yes.

00:35.660 --> 00:38.429
I mean, I-I just... I
don't want to jinx it.

00:38.430 --> 00:40.297
You know, we really are this close

00:40.298 --> 00:44.301
to having a meaningful
territorial accord

00:44.302 --> 00:46.670
with all the countries
of the Asia Pacific,

00:46.671 --> 00:49.239
including China. Boom.

00:49.240 --> 00:50.641
Wow. So, what?

00:50.642 --> 00:52.363
You've, uh, you've
figured out who's getting

00:52.364 --> 00:54.565
all the oil and natural
gas in the South China Sea?

00:54.566 --> 00:57.381
No, not... that.

00:57.382 --> 00:59.750
But we have settled the fate of

00:59.751 --> 01:03.620
the disputed islands,
yes, and... fishing and...

01:03.621 --> 01:04.754
That's good, too.

01:04.756 --> 01:05.889
He's only interested

01:05.890 --> 01:07.458
because the Philippines are involved,

01:07.459 --> 01:09.882
and he's obsessed with their
new president, that Andrada guy.

01:09.883 --> 01:11.028
Oh, like you aren't.

01:11.029 --> 01:13.097
Of course I am. He's
a total genuine psycho.

01:13.098 --> 01:15.399
Okay, can we just go with
"rough around the edges"

01:15.400 --> 01:16.567
for the sake of diplomacy?

01:16.568 --> 01:17.768
I'm sorry.

01:17.769 --> 01:20.204
Have you seen the videos
he made during his campaign

01:20.205 --> 01:23.941
where he dressed up like his
opponents and mocked them?

01:23.942 --> 01:26.777
And challenged them
to kickboxing matches

01:26.778 --> 01:28.011
in kickboxing gear.

01:28.012 --> 01:30.013
I... concede that

01:30.014 --> 01:33.350
President Andrada ran an
unconventional campaign.

01:33.351 --> 01:35.014
But now that Andrada
has won the election,

01:35.015 --> 01:37.888
he has the hard work of leading
his country to worry about.

01:37.889 --> 01:40.457
He's gonna have to get along
with a lot of different people

01:40.458 --> 01:42.626
if he wants to get anything done.

01:42.627 --> 01:44.428
Hey, you know what, kids?
School's at the same time today.

01:44.429 --> 01:45.996
- Crazy how that works.
- Ha, ha, Dad.

01:45.997 --> 01:47.331
Come on, grab your stuff.

01:47.332 --> 01:48.832
Let's go.

01:48.833 --> 01:53.303
Oh. Russell Jackson. "WHN."

01:53.304 --> 01:55.072
WHN.

01:55.073 --> 01:57.441
Uh, White House now.

01:57.442 --> 02:01.545
Oh, for the halcyon days when
he used to spell everything out.

02:01.546 --> 02:04.948
And so the time has come for the
proud people of the Philippines

02:04.949 --> 02:08.786
to stop living in the
shadow of the United States.

02:08.787 --> 02:11.088
No longer will we accept the title of

02:11.089 --> 02:13.857
"little brown brother"
that was bestowed on us

02:13.858 --> 02:18.429
by a country that proudly
calls itself a superpower.

02:18.430 --> 02:22.065
To hell with them and
their colonial arrogance.

02:22.066 --> 02:24.935
I will make the
Philippines a superpower.

02:24.936 --> 02:30.340
So, no, we will not participate
in the Singapore Interchange.

02:30.341 --> 02:34.344
How did this carny barker actually win?

02:34.345 --> 02:35.612
This is who you get

02:35.613 --> 02:37.815
when the qualified
front-runner in an election

02:37.816 --> 02:39.516
gets caught in a bribing scandal.

02:39.517 --> 02:40.784
Well, it's not just that,

02:40.785 --> 02:43.086
unfortunately. President Andrada

02:43.087 --> 02:45.391
has a populist message, and
people are starting to listen.

02:45.392 --> 02:47.624
Well, he gave that speech in English.

02:47.625 --> 02:49.526
He definitely wanted us to listen.

02:49.527 --> 02:50.661
Good point.

02:50.662 --> 02:52.023
If this is who we're dealing with,

02:52.024 --> 02:53.687
we need to understand
how to approach him.

02:53.688 --> 02:57.201
Well, the simplest way to put it
is textbook clinical narcissist.

02:57.202 --> 03:00.204
Exaggerated feelings of
self-importance, pathological

03:00.205 --> 03:02.773
need for admiration, and
a complete lack of empathy.

03:02.774 --> 03:05.309
So, for example, he doesn't
care that the U.S. has

03:05.310 --> 03:08.111
a naval base in his
country, or that we've

03:08.112 --> 03:10.447
stood with the Filipino
people for decades?

03:10.448 --> 03:12.049
The U.S. has close to

03:12.050 --> 03:15.252
a 90% approval rating
with the Filipino people.

03:15.253 --> 03:16.220
Is Andrada's rhetoric

03:16.221 --> 03:17.888
really having a significant effect?

03:17.889 --> 03:19.823
He's a successful businessman,

03:19.824 --> 03:21.792
owns a chain of major supermarkets.

03:21.793 --> 03:24.728
The folk hero nature of
it all has popular appeal.

03:24.729 --> 03:26.330
As a businessman,

03:26.331 --> 03:28.599
these last-minute antics
might be nothing more

03:28.600 --> 03:30.234
than a negotiating tactic.

03:30.235 --> 03:32.669
Then maybe it's time to call his bluff.

03:32.670 --> 03:35.239
Cut 'em loose, let him see how it feels

03:35.240 --> 03:37.641
to face the Chinese with
nothing but his bluster.

03:37.642 --> 03:39.776
As appealing as that sounds,

03:39.777 --> 03:40.944
it's too risky.

03:40.945 --> 03:43.080
We need the Philippines
to help us keep the Chinese

03:43.081 --> 03:44.984
from further encroaching
on the South China Sea.

03:44.985 --> 03:46.016
There's really no point

03:46.017 --> 03:48.685
in continuing the Singapore
Interchange without them.

03:48.686 --> 03:51.555
Well, then let me go to Manila first.

03:51.556 --> 03:53.924
If his motives are as superficial

03:53.925 --> 03:56.527
as Director Haymond says
they are, they can be

03:56.528 --> 03:59.096
easily countered with a
little face-to-face diplomacy.

03:59.097 --> 04:00.430
You really think you can

04:00.431 --> 04:01.798
reason with the guy in that video?

04:01.799 --> 04:04.334
Who said anything about reason?

04:04.335 --> 04:06.069
I'm gonna play to his ego,

04:06.070 --> 04:08.071
offer him up some military hardware

04:08.072 --> 04:10.440
to boost his superpower fantasy.

04:10.441 --> 04:11.675
Give him drones.

04:11.676 --> 04:14.011
Everyone and their
grandmother loves drones.

04:14.012 --> 04:16.178
Go ahead, Bess. Put together
a package with D.O.D.

04:16.180 --> 04:17.214
Give it your best shot.

04:17.214 --> 04:20.250
Hey, Mo.

04:20.250 --> 04:21.552
Where are they?

04:21.553 --> 04:22.920
Middle of nowhere.

04:22.921 --> 04:25.155
Bath County, outside of Warm Springs.

04:25.156 --> 04:27.591
Accessible by a single dirt road.

04:27.592 --> 04:29.826
Sounds about right for a doomsday cult.

04:29.827 --> 04:31.862
And not too far from our dead drop.

04:31.863 --> 04:32.863
Yeah.

04:32.864 --> 04:34.698
Except no word from Ian yet.

04:34.699 --> 04:37.367
How confident are we in this location?

04:37.368 --> 04:39.369
Tech's crunched millions of data points

04:39.370 --> 04:41.905
from the signal off of Ian's
camera before it crapped out.

04:41.906 --> 04:44.007
Narrowed it to within a 50th of a mile.

04:44.008 --> 04:44.908
We're confident.

04:44.909 --> 04:46.376
Have we at least got eyes there now?

04:46.377 --> 04:48.345
High-altitude drone's in flight,

04:48.346 --> 04:50.514
but not much we could see from above.

04:50.515 --> 04:53.617
Maybe we can get close on the ground.

04:53.618 --> 04:55.352
Yeah.

04:55.353 --> 04:57.020
That's kind of the plan.

04:57.021 --> 04:59.323
You want to raid?

04:59.324 --> 05:00.757
Not just me.

05:00.758 --> 05:01.925
I'm gonna talk to Marguerite.

05:01.926 --> 05:03.627
This is coming from the director.

05:03.628 --> 05:05.662
All this decided in the half hour

05:05.663 --> 05:07.264
it took me to get down here?

05:07.265 --> 05:10.300
Gears move pretty quick when the
big, scary bomb is in the hands

05:10.301 --> 05:12.102
of highly-motivated nut bars.

05:12.103 --> 05:13.584
We don't even know the bomb is there,

05:13.585 --> 05:15.408
and we damn well don't
know our asset is dead.

05:15.409 --> 05:16.940
He's dormant. It's the same thing.

05:16.941 --> 05:18.208
What if he's confined?

05:18.209 --> 05:20.272
We go in there guns blazing,
he won't have a chance.

05:20.273 --> 05:21.311
It's been four days.

05:21.312 --> 05:23.046
Well, maybe they need more than that

05:23.047 --> 05:24.448
to trust a new recruit.

05:24.449 --> 05:26.617
We saw nothing in Ian's video feed

05:26.618 --> 05:28.001
that would suggest he'd been made.

05:28.002 --> 05:28.986
Yeah, no, all we saw

05:28.987 --> 05:31.050
was Ian drowned in a trough,
and then radio silence.

05:31.051 --> 05:32.823
We have to act on what we have.

05:32.824 --> 05:34.057
Which is a lot of conjecture.

05:34.058 --> 05:36.159
Like, hey, what if the
bomb is someplace else,

05:36.160 --> 05:39.329
ready to go, and this tips
them into using it? No.

05:39.330 --> 05:42.866
Based on Ian's preparation
and my knowledge of C.O.J.,

05:42.867 --> 05:44.468
I think a raid is premature.

05:44.469 --> 05:46.736
Take it to the director.

05:47.804 --> 05:51.375
Hugh, I-I got your
report on Kevin Park.

05:51.376 --> 05:53.399
Joseph Garcia, the CIA
operative in our department.

05:53.400 --> 05:55.712
- Okay, good.
- Yeah, I just had a couple of questions.

05:55.713 --> 05:58.782
Oh, uh, cyanide poison placed

05:58.783 --> 06:01.218
in an herbal supplement
that he was already taking.

06:01.219 --> 06:03.202
That's all we know at this
point, Madam Secretary.

06:03.203 --> 06:04.988
And that his last
posting was in Somalia,

06:04.989 --> 06:06.623
working in counter-proliferation?

06:06.624 --> 06:08.058
Right.

06:08.059 --> 06:10.927
So his position in
Budget and Planning...

06:10.928 --> 06:14.197
was that just cover
until his next assignment,

06:14.198 --> 06:16.533
or was he investigating
something specific

06:16.534 --> 06:18.869
having to do with the State Department?

06:18.870 --> 06:22.138
I'm sure my next report will
answer many of your questions.

06:23.774 --> 06:25.776
You know, I-I definitely
understand the need

06:25.777 --> 06:27.477
to compartmentalize an investigation

06:27.478 --> 06:29.179
as sensitive as this one.

06:29.180 --> 06:32.249
But, well, given my
experience in the CIA

06:32.250 --> 06:34.951
and that Garcia was operating
in my own department,

06:34.952 --> 06:36.920
I think I might be able to assist.

06:36.921 --> 06:39.656
If we need your assistance,
we will not hesitate to ask.

06:39.657 --> 06:42.092
So, best of luck on your
trip to the Philippines.

06:42.093 --> 06:44.393
Oh. Great. Thanks.

06:48.265 --> 06:50.467
Madam Secretary, I have your
travel book for the trip.

06:50.468 --> 06:51.902
And I have your briefcase.

06:51.903 --> 06:53.904
Oh, oh. Well, it takes a village.

06:53.905 --> 06:55.528
Well, there's nothing
else you need here,

06:55.529 --> 06:56.707
and the car is waiting.

06:56.708 --> 06:57.808
As is the plane.

06:57.809 --> 06:59.776
They keep gently
reminding me in all caps.

06:59.777 --> 07:02.079
The window to visit Andrada
in the Philippines and make it

07:02.080 --> 07:04.481
to Singapore in time is extremely tight.

07:04.482 --> 07:08.452
And the change of itinerary has
caused a bit of, um, huffiness.

07:08.453 --> 07:11.488
Huffiness. Oh, well,
we better get going.

07:11.489 --> 07:13.056
Uh, you know what?

07:13.057 --> 07:15.559
I just... I just need one, one

07:15.560 --> 07:17.194
- quick second.
- But, ma'am, the...

07:17.195 --> 07:19.662
I'll be right... One minute, I promise.

07:21.331 --> 07:23.300
Hey, I need to talk to you

07:23.301 --> 07:25.969
about something that we're
not really talking about.

07:25.970 --> 07:27.204
Okay.

07:27.205 --> 07:28.605
I'm not listening.

07:28.606 --> 07:30.107
While I'm gone, I want you

07:30.108 --> 07:32.175
to look into whatever
Joseph Garcia was up to.

07:32.176 --> 07:36.413
Check his phone and digital
records, his personal files.

07:36.414 --> 07:38.482
If he had an unusual
interest in anything,

07:38.483 --> 07:39.983
I want to know about it.

07:39.984 --> 07:42.018
You mean do what the CIA
is probably already doing

07:42.019 --> 07:43.922
without the CIA finding
out that we're doing it?

07:43.923 --> 07:47.991
I'm getting boxed out because
it happened in my department,

07:47.992 --> 07:50.060
and because I'm no longer in the CIA.

07:50.061 --> 07:51.595
They can be funny that way.

07:51.596 --> 07:53.730
Is there some reason
that you don't trust them?

07:53.731 --> 07:55.165
They're territorial

07:55.166 --> 07:57.701
and slow, and I just want
to get a jump on it in case

07:57.702 --> 07:59.885
there's any kind of issue
that we need to get ahead of.

07:59.886 --> 08:01.671
Because someone on our
floor was dating him?

08:01.672 --> 08:03.373
- That, too.
- Okay, ma'am. I'm on it.

08:03.374 --> 08:05.342
- Well...
- Except, you know, I'm not.

08:05.343 --> 08:07.643
Thank you.

08:09.913 --> 08:13.450
Mr. President, Secretary
of State Elizabeth McCord.

08:13.451 --> 08:15.085
Secretary McCord, mabuhay.

08:15.086 --> 08:17.687
Thank you so much for
agreeing to meet with me

08:17.688 --> 08:19.189
on such short notice.

08:19.190 --> 08:20.357
I'm very grateful.

08:20.358 --> 08:23.160
I can offer you coffee or fruit.

08:23.161 --> 08:25.829
Oh. Uh, no. I'm fine, thank you. Thanks.

08:25.830 --> 08:27.330
May I call you Elizabeth?

08:27.331 --> 08:28.598
Sure.

08:28.599 --> 08:31.067
May I call you Datu?

08:31.068 --> 08:33.270
I don't believe that's appropriate.

08:35.239 --> 08:36.840
Of course.

08:36.841 --> 08:40.110
I... I wanted to congratulate you

08:40.111 --> 08:42.245
on your election, Mr. President.

08:42.246 --> 08:45.582
Really? I know Dalton
supported my opponent.

08:45.583 --> 08:48.251
He underestimated me, but, of course,

08:48.252 --> 08:50.120
so did my opponent.

08:50.121 --> 08:53.557
He had no idea my people
would be looking into

08:53.558 --> 08:55.258
his crooked financial dealings.

08:55.259 --> 08:57.227
Please...

08:57.228 --> 08:59.763
sit... Elizabeth.

08:59.764 --> 09:01.331
Well, I am sure

09:01.332 --> 09:06.736
that you are going to be a
strong and principled leader.

09:06.737 --> 09:10.774
I will make the Philippines
stronger and more independent.

09:10.775 --> 09:14.110
Oh. President Andrada, don't you find

09:14.111 --> 09:16.847
in the final analysis that it is

09:16.848 --> 09:19.015
our friendships and our partnerships

09:19.016 --> 09:21.084
that determine our true strength?

09:21.085 --> 09:22.452
If they're the right ones.

09:22.453 --> 09:24.788
Yes.

09:24.789 --> 09:27.490
Which is why I am here, as your partner,

09:27.491 --> 09:31.394
to ask you to join me in Singapore.

09:31.395 --> 09:34.564
You must know how vital these talks are

09:34.565 --> 09:37.634
to finalizing the jurisdiction

09:37.635 --> 09:40.804
of the remaining contested
South China Sea Islands.

09:40.805 --> 09:44.274
And... um, some of

09:44.275 --> 09:48.678
those islands that China is claiming,

09:48.679 --> 09:50.914
specifically the Scarborough Shoal,

09:50.915 --> 09:54.451
are widely considered
to be yours, after all.

09:54.452 --> 09:56.386
Partners.

09:56.387 --> 10:00.257
You call us this now, but
that was not your intention

10:00.258 --> 10:02.125
when you bought us from Spain

10:02.126 --> 10:05.861
and kept us as a colony
after promising us freedom.

10:08.131 --> 10:12.402
I agree, that was a... dark beginning,

10:12.403 --> 10:17.374
but it was also a very different
time in both of our histories.

10:17.375 --> 10:20.977
Perhaps it is time for us
to go our separate ways.

10:20.978 --> 10:24.547
President Andrada...

10:24.548 --> 10:26.349
what do you want?

10:26.350 --> 10:29.019
Oh, what are you offering?

10:29.020 --> 10:32.389
Military reinforcements.

10:32.390 --> 10:34.790
Five V-22 Ospreys.

10:38.695 --> 10:42.598
We would need at least ten Ospreys.

10:45.602 --> 10:47.704
I can authorize that.

10:47.705 --> 10:49.773
And a new aircraft carrier.

10:49.774 --> 10:52.809
What about RQ-4 Global Hawks?

10:52.810 --> 10:55.145
What about tactical nuclear missiles?

10:55.146 --> 10:59.148
I think you know that's
just not on the table.

11:02.018 --> 11:04.621
How do you feel about drones?

11:08.358 --> 11:10.794
I like what I am hearing.

11:10.795 --> 11:14.464
Do you have any idea how
sexy it is to hear a woman

11:14.465 --> 11:15.899
talking about drones?

11:19.337 --> 11:23.006
Well, I think that if we can...

11:23.007 --> 11:25.475
generally agree on

11:25.476 --> 11:30.213
the kind and amount of
military reinforcements

11:30.214 --> 11:32.148
that you're interested in, then I think

11:32.149 --> 11:34.183
we can probably presume these...

12:02.108 --> 12:04.456
I have to say, breaking
the president's nose

12:04.457 --> 12:06.224
is a whole new form of diplomacy.

12:06.225 --> 12:08.951
So is groping the secretary of state,

12:08.952 --> 12:10.686
in my experience.

12:10.687 --> 12:12.255
But you're okay?

12:12.256 --> 12:14.390
Yeah.

12:14.391 --> 12:18.063
I know this doesn't bode well
for the Singapore Interchange.

12:18.064 --> 12:19.965
Then again, Sugar Ray McCord

12:19.966 --> 12:22.268
has put the world on notice about

12:22.269 --> 12:23.469
how we deal with bullies.

12:23.470 --> 12:24.870
That's not funny, Russell.

12:24.871 --> 12:26.305
I'm not kidding. It's badass.

12:26.306 --> 12:29.141
The man is even more
unhinged than we thought.

12:29.142 --> 12:31.210
How are we supposed
to proceed from here?

12:32.312 --> 12:33.612
Excuse me, Mr. President.

12:33.613 --> 12:36.515
General Reeves.

12:36.516 --> 12:38.517
Mr. President, we're just getting word

12:38.518 --> 12:40.319
that President Andrada
has officially ordered

12:40.320 --> 12:43.255
all American military
out of the Philippines.

12:43.256 --> 12:45.224
He's claiming he will rip up

12:45.225 --> 12:47.359
our Enhanced Defense
Cooperation Agreement.

12:47.360 --> 12:49.384
- Fantastic.
- Thank you, General.

12:49.385 --> 12:50.963
Sir.

12:50.964 --> 12:54.166
Okay, wait, let's take a breath.

12:54.167 --> 12:56.001
Kicking the U.S. military

12:56.002 --> 12:58.137
out of a country doesn't
happen in an afternoon.

12:58.138 --> 13:00.005
I think if

13:00.006 --> 13:01.907
I apologize to Andrada,

13:01.908 --> 13:05.311
suggest that he... caught me by surprise

13:05.312 --> 13:07.346
and I acted on instinct...

13:08.682 --> 13:10.049
I can grovel.

13:10.050 --> 13:11.750
I'm a decent groveler.

13:11.751 --> 13:14.653
And things were going so well
up until I broke his nose.

13:14.654 --> 13:17.556
Not a sentence you hear every day.

13:17.557 --> 13:18.657
Blake, what is it?

13:18.658 --> 13:20.526
Uh, President Andrada wants us to leave.

13:20.527 --> 13:24.029
Yeah, I-I know. We're working
to resolve that right now.

13:24.030 --> 13:26.265
No, no. Us. You and me.

13:26.266 --> 13:28.801
He sent the military police to
kick us out of the Philippines

13:28.802 --> 13:30.101
right now.

13:54.460 --> 13:56.428
- You sure you're okay?
- Yeah.

13:56.429 --> 13:58.697
Yeah, should've seen the other guy.

13:58.698 --> 14:02.534
I did. Andrada's been posting
all these photos of himself

14:02.535 --> 14:06.939
with his nose splint and his black eyes.

14:06.940 --> 14:09.641
Really?

14:09.642 --> 14:11.777
Thought he'd be embarrassed and lay low.

14:11.778 --> 14:13.178
Oh, no.

14:13.179 --> 14:16.115
He's very proud of the fact
that he got his nose broken

14:16.116 --> 14:18.449
at the gym by his sparring partner.

14:19.618 --> 14:21.787
Guy named Cobra.

14:21.788 --> 14:24.188
You're gonna start calling
me Cobra now, aren't you?

14:24.957 --> 14:27.325
As soon as it's funny.

14:28.994 --> 14:32.097
Well, that cover story works for me.

14:32.098 --> 14:35.300
He doesn't want to admit
he got beat up by a girl.

14:35.301 --> 14:38.804
I'm not excited for a headline that says

14:38.805 --> 14:40.339
I clobbered a world leader

14:40.340 --> 14:42.374
instead of saving a
major regional agreement.

14:42.375 --> 14:44.410
Is there any point in even asking

14:44.411 --> 14:45.911
what the guy was thinking?

14:45.912 --> 14:48.414
When he tried to grope
me or when he ordered

14:48.415 --> 14:50.749
the U.S. military out
of the Philippines?

14:50.750 --> 14:52.785
He is a psycho.

14:52.786 --> 14:54.086
What about you?

14:54.087 --> 14:57.990
You... you hear anything
from the dead drop?

14:57.991 --> 15:00.259
I just wish we had more time.

15:00.260 --> 15:02.127
Well, I'm familiar with that feeling.

15:02.128 --> 15:04.096
But right now,

15:04.097 --> 15:07.899
I have to shower and get
back into the fight, so...

15:11.437 --> 15:14.406
President Andrada even
trotted out some flunky

15:14.407 --> 15:16.208
who agreed to play his sparring partner.

15:16.209 --> 15:17.776
The guy took it a step further

15:17.777 --> 15:19.812
by making himself up to
look even more pummeled.

15:19.813 --> 15:21.914
Unless Andrada actually let
him kick him in the face.

15:21.915 --> 15:24.117
So when are we gonna make a statement

15:24.118 --> 15:25.250
about what really happened?

15:25.251 --> 15:27.653
If by "we," do you mean the secretary?

15:27.654 --> 15:29.621
Why don't you ask her?

15:29.622 --> 15:31.123
Ask me what?

15:31.124 --> 15:33.325
If you're gonna tell the
real story to the press.

15:33.326 --> 15:36.361
The real story is that
the Singapore Interchange,

15:36.362 --> 15:37.796
which we've fought for and nurtured

15:37.797 --> 15:39.598
for months, is now on hold,

15:39.599 --> 15:41.667
and the future looks hopeless.

15:41.668 --> 15:43.332
Ma'am, I hope you're
not blaming yourself.

15:43.333 --> 15:44.937
Of course I am.

15:44.938 --> 15:47.673
It's my job to keep those talks alive.

15:47.674 --> 15:49.508
But Andrada sexually assaulted you.

15:49.509 --> 15:51.543
How are you supposed to turn that into

15:51.544 --> 15:52.578
a diplomatic discussion?

15:52.579 --> 15:54.246
I realize it's your call,

15:54.247 --> 15:56.682
ma'am, but I feel like
we're covering up for him.

15:56.683 --> 15:58.183
I just think it's wrong

15:58.184 --> 16:01.820
that the world doesn't know
what he tried to do to you.

16:01.821 --> 16:04.823
With no witnesses, it'd
be his word against mine.

16:04.824 --> 16:07.593
I think we've all seen
how that turns out.

16:07.594 --> 16:10.696
Plus, the accusation
comes from the very country

16:10.697 --> 16:13.765
that Andrada is working
hard to demonize,

16:13.766 --> 16:15.167
so his nationalistic message

16:15.168 --> 16:18.403
might actually gain more support.

16:18.404 --> 16:20.839
If we break our alliance
with the Philippines

16:20.840 --> 16:23.709
because of the whims of
their would-be despot,

16:23.710 --> 16:26.545
we would leave the
Filipino people vulnerable

16:26.546 --> 16:29.681
to Chinese expansion,
which could jeopardize

16:29.682 --> 16:32.417
the lives and civil
liberties of millions.

16:32.418 --> 16:34.553
Madam Secretary, may
I have a quick word?

16:34.554 --> 16:37.355
Sure. My office.

16:38.878 --> 16:40.359
Garcia was reviewing the department's

16:40.360 --> 16:42.794
approved arms sales from the last year.

16:42.795 --> 16:45.931
Makes sense, since he was
in counter-proliferation.

16:45.932 --> 16:47.315
It's all the usual rubber-stamping

16:47.316 --> 16:48.534
except for one thing.

16:48.535 --> 16:51.203
He made a number of phone
calls to a state-owned air field

16:51.204 --> 16:52.237
in Egypt,

16:52.238 --> 16:55.707
and sent follow-up
requests wanting to know

16:55.708 --> 16:58.710
how much fuel was sold
to American cargo planes

16:58.711 --> 17:00.412
carrying State Department-approved

17:00.413 --> 17:03.282
weapons shipments from
the U.S. to Somalia.

17:03.283 --> 17:04.816
Did he get an answer?

17:04.817 --> 17:06.440
The Egyptian government
was stalling him.

17:06.441 --> 17:08.252
If you want me to look further into it,

17:08.253 --> 17:10.756
I have a friend from grad
school who's a travel advisor

17:10.757 --> 17:12.089
to the Egyptian government.

17:12.090 --> 17:13.959
Somebody you trust?

17:13.960 --> 17:15.928
I'll be discreet.

17:15.929 --> 17:17.796
Okay, do that. I'm
gonna get the manifests

17:17.797 --> 17:20.065
for the cargo being
shipped on those flights.

17:21.367 --> 17:24.201
It's the White House.
They need you A.S.A.P.

17:25.871 --> 17:30.541
That's probably not
a welcome home party.

17:31.310 --> 17:32.911
We intercepted

17:32.912 --> 17:35.514
signals intelligence from
the Filipino government

17:35.515 --> 17:36.949
to the Chinese,

17:36.950 --> 17:40.219
outlining the sharing
of disputed islands.

17:40.220 --> 17:41.386
Which islands?

17:41.387 --> 17:43.654
The Scarborough Shoal.

17:45.357 --> 17:48.126
A key element of the
Singapore Interchange

17:48.127 --> 17:53.065
was the agreement that
China would not unilaterally

17:53.066 --> 17:55.267
claim sovereignty over
the Scarborough Shoal

17:55.268 --> 17:58.770
and would respect other
countries' access to the area.

17:58.771 --> 18:01.907
Plus, the Scarborough Shoal
is closest to the Philippines.

18:01.908 --> 18:03.571
They have the strongest
sovereignty claim.

18:03.572 --> 18:06.245
This is looking like the
Philippines is not making

18:06.246 --> 18:09.314
a bid to stand on its own but
actually pivoting to China.

18:09.315 --> 18:11.550
Which would be a disaster
for the balance of power

18:11.551 --> 18:13.151
in Southeast Asia.

18:13.152 --> 18:14.786
This can't be something

18:14.787 --> 18:17.421
the rest of the Filipino
government really wants.

18:18.790 --> 18:20.892
China's disapproval rating there is 65%.

18:20.893 --> 18:23.562
Hell, we almost ended
up in a war with China

18:23.563 --> 18:25.597
defending these
passageways for our allies,

18:25.598 --> 18:27.132
including the Philippines.

18:27.133 --> 18:28.934
Now Andrada's just giving it all away?

18:28.935 --> 18:30.038
The Filipino people

18:30.039 --> 18:32.838
rolled the dice on a... erratic,

18:32.839 --> 18:34.139
self-obsessed strongman.

18:34.140 --> 18:35.574
Now they're paying the price.

18:35.575 --> 18:37.042
The irony being that,

18:37.043 --> 18:39.878
just like any other
so-called strongman,

18:39.879 --> 18:41.346
he isn't strong at all.

18:41.347 --> 18:44.950
He's just insecure and weak,
without any good policy ideas,

18:44.951 --> 18:47.319
so he has to bully his way into power

18:47.320 --> 18:49.154
and force himself on women

18:49.155 --> 18:51.156
to feel powerful...

18:51.157 --> 18:54.559
I'm guessing this isn't just
you working things out, Bess.

18:54.560 --> 18:57.596
Andrada can't be liked by people

18:57.597 --> 18:59.854
who actually know him,
not even his inner circle.

18:59.855 --> 19:02.000
We should reach out to his advisors.

19:02.001 --> 19:04.202
There have to be some who
aren't happy with this change.

19:04.203 --> 19:06.405
That's a start.

19:06.406 --> 19:08.473
But if I might suggest
something more aggressive.

19:08.474 --> 19:10.342
We have a good enough relationship

19:10.343 --> 19:13.045
with their military to
reach out in confidence.

19:13.046 --> 19:15.580
It's a moderate
transgression of protocol,

19:15.581 --> 19:17.982
but I think it's worth the risk.

19:20.686 --> 19:22.988
Let's contact their
military's chief of staff.

19:22.989 --> 19:24.755
Yes, sir.

19:28.361 --> 19:30.028
Hot off the presses.

19:30.029 --> 19:31.730
Did they authenticate Ian's handwriting?

19:31.731 --> 19:33.198
Perfect match.

19:33.199 --> 19:36.068
We even got photo confirmation
of him making the drop.

19:36.069 --> 19:37.803
Took him long enough, huh?

19:37.804 --> 19:39.404
He wants to meet tomorrow.

19:39.405 --> 19:40.339
I'll go.

19:40.340 --> 19:42.974
Of course.

19:42.975 --> 19:44.176
It's good news. What is it?

19:44.177 --> 19:45.843
I screwed up, man.

19:47.412 --> 19:50.582
If we went ahead with that raid,
I could've gotten Ian killed.

19:50.583 --> 19:53.051
You're in good company.

19:53.052 --> 19:54.786
Ultimately, it was the director's call.

19:54.787 --> 19:56.054
Go easy on yourself.

19:57.256 --> 19:58.857
Let's go over the meeting protocol.

19:58.858 --> 20:00.659
Yeah, let's do it.

20:00.660 --> 20:03.428
I can assure you that
President Andrada's decision

20:03.429 --> 20:05.630
to pivot away from the United States

20:05.631 --> 20:08.567
is not one that is
shared by our military.

20:08.568 --> 20:10.035
I appreciate that, General.

20:10.036 --> 20:12.204
Can you give us any insight into

20:12.205 --> 20:14.706
President Andrada's
fascination with China?

20:14.707 --> 20:15.841
Only that he seems

20:15.842 --> 20:18.110
unshakable in this new friendship.

20:18.111 --> 20:20.779
And, unfortunately, he
has unilateral powers

20:20.780 --> 20:23.815
to destroy the Enhanced
Defense Cooperation Agreement

20:23.816 --> 20:25.450
between our two countries.

20:25.451 --> 20:28.186
General, is there a cabinet member or...

20:28.187 --> 20:30.188
trusted advisor who can convince him

20:30.189 --> 20:34.059
that China will not operate in
the Philippines' best interest?

20:34.060 --> 20:36.395
I can assure you, Madam Secretary,

20:36.396 --> 20:38.697
that all avenues have been explored.

20:38.698 --> 20:40.899
My colleagues and I have serious

20:40.900 --> 20:43.802
security concerns with
China's gain in power.

20:43.803 --> 20:47.606
It is our feeling that we
are at a critical juncture,

20:47.607 --> 20:51.643
one that requires critical action.

20:51.644 --> 20:53.445
If I may speak candidly, Mr. President,

20:53.446 --> 20:56.982
assuming we are all relying
on each other's discretion

20:56.983 --> 20:58.583
and confidentiality.

20:58.584 --> 20:59.751
Go ahead, General.

20:59.752 --> 21:00.919
We have good reason

21:00.920 --> 21:03.922
to believe that newly
elected Vice President

21:03.923 --> 21:07.659
Thea Navarro does not share
President Andrada's desire

21:07.660 --> 21:10.061
for Chinese friendship.

21:10.062 --> 21:14.399
Should something
happen to the president,

21:14.400 --> 21:16.902
we have been assured that,
with President Navarro,

21:16.903 --> 21:19.971
we could all go back to
our valued relationship

21:19.972 --> 21:22.040
and an alignment of power

21:22.041 --> 21:24.576
that would keep peace and security.

21:24.577 --> 21:28.647
We have a plan in place, but
it can only be carried out

21:28.648 --> 21:31.782
with the full support
of the United States.

21:33.251 --> 21:34.786
We will have to talk

21:34.787 --> 21:37.722
and get back to you, General Purisima.

21:37.723 --> 21:39.124
Of course.

21:39.125 --> 21:40.891
We will wait to hear.

21:44.129 --> 21:47.833
Just to confirm we all
heard the same thing,

21:47.834 --> 21:53.237
that was a clear offer
for a covert assassination.

22:11.669 --> 22:13.537
Okay.

22:13.538 --> 22:15.740
I know we're not really
having this conversation,

22:15.741 --> 22:19.143
but if we were, getting rid of Andrada

22:19.144 --> 22:20.911
is certainly the cleanest solution

22:20.912 --> 22:22.346
to all our problems.

22:22.347 --> 22:24.081
Stopping an alliance
that would give China

22:24.082 --> 22:26.384
a stranglehold on the Asia Pacific,

22:26.385 --> 22:28.552
potentially leading
to military conflicts,

22:28.553 --> 22:30.755
costing thousands,
maybe millions of lives.

22:30.756 --> 22:32.189
Worse things have been perpetrated

22:32.190 --> 22:34.492
in the name of keeping
the balance of power.

22:34.493 --> 22:36.994
Again, if this were a real discussion.

22:36.995 --> 22:40.665
Cozying up to China
could mean Andrada might

22:40.666 --> 22:43.868
lean toward a progressively
less democratic government,

22:43.869 --> 22:46.103
and who knows what kind of autocratic

22:46.104 --> 22:48.306
abuses of power he'll carry out next?

22:48.307 --> 22:52.410
All we would have to do is
let nature take its course.

22:52.411 --> 22:55.146
The lion eats the wildebeest...

22:55.147 --> 22:57.214
and we just sit at home,

22:57.215 --> 22:58.949
watch it all on the nature channel.

22:58.950 --> 23:01.919
Unless their military decides
that they should be in power.

23:01.920 --> 23:03.583
Then I don't know what
the Filipino people

23:03.584 --> 23:05.423
will have, but it won't be a democracy.

23:05.424 --> 23:07.358
I mean, not to mention

23:07.359 --> 23:08.959
this could destroy our credibility. I...

23:08.983 --> 23:11.495
The risk of exposure is limited
to the people in this room.

23:11.496 --> 23:13.564
I-I don't think that's
a serious consideration.

23:13.565 --> 23:14.788
Yeah, well, famous last words.

23:14.789 --> 23:17.268
Sir, are we done

23:17.269 --> 23:20.404
saying the unthinkable?

23:20.405 --> 23:22.606
We need to walk away from this option.

23:22.607 --> 23:25.543
Let's use our vast
intelligence resources

23:25.544 --> 23:28.012
and find some skeletons in his closet.

23:28.013 --> 23:29.980
Considering Andrada's character

23:29.981 --> 23:32.917
and behavior, maybe if we dig deeper

23:32.918 --> 23:34.581
we'll find something
to leverage him with.

23:34.582 --> 23:37.388
What, petty bribes,
girlfriends, coarse rhetoric?

23:37.389 --> 23:39.423
His voters knew about all of it.

23:39.424 --> 23:40.725
No one cared.

23:40.726 --> 23:44.128
I agree it's a long shot, but...

23:44.129 --> 23:45.930
isn't anything worth trying

23:45.931 --> 23:48.998
before turning a blind
eye to assassination?

23:51.737 --> 23:53.738
Oh, and here she is
in her little snowsuit.

23:53.739 --> 23:54.839
Oh...

23:54.840 --> 23:56.640
She just kept falling over and laughing.

23:56.641 --> 23:57.742
Just endlessly amused.

23:57.743 --> 23:59.110
Is she talking?

23:59.111 --> 24:01.078
Constantly. Some full sentences.

24:01.079 --> 24:02.480
I know every father

24:02.481 --> 24:05.750
probably feels this way,
but... I think she's gifted.

24:05.751 --> 24:07.785
Well, why wouldn't she
be? Look at her parents.

24:07.786 --> 24:09.854
How is Abby?

24:09.855 --> 24:11.555
She's okay.

24:11.556 --> 24:13.323
She's, uh...

24:15.092 --> 24:18.662
We're going through a bad time.

24:18.663 --> 24:20.563
Separated.

24:21.966 --> 24:24.802
I think it's gonna work out, but, uh...

24:24.803 --> 24:26.670
it's-it's rough right now.

24:26.671 --> 24:29.507
I'm sorry to hear that.

24:29.508 --> 24:31.208
Well, how about you?

24:31.209 --> 24:32.743
Oh, the usual.

24:32.744 --> 24:34.478
All work, no play.

24:34.479 --> 24:36.947
I swear I'm gonna get a
social life any minute now.

24:36.948 --> 24:40.149
It's just... I've been meaning
to do that for about 15 years.

24:47.425 --> 24:51.262
Just to be clear, this
isn't us doing that, right?

24:51.263 --> 24:53.564
What, you mean a-a date?

24:53.565 --> 24:56.000
No, no. I... No.

24:56.001 --> 24:58.202
It's not the craziest idea in the world.

24:58.203 --> 24:59.570
We flirted back in school.

24:59.571 --> 25:01.205
Sorry, I didn't mean it like that.

25:01.206 --> 25:03.007
I just, uh...

25:03.008 --> 25:04.942
I, uh, I'm still very married.

25:04.943 --> 25:09.647
And I can't even wrap my head
around the... other thing.

25:09.648 --> 25:12.516
Okay. But I distinctly
get the feeling that

25:12.517 --> 25:15.619
we're not just here to catch
each other up on our sad lives.

25:15.620 --> 25:17.803
Well, I haven't even told
you about the small apartment

25:17.804 --> 25:21.158
with a futon, crib and a
bottle of vodka in the freezer.

25:21.159 --> 25:23.727
No, I'm... I need some information.

25:23.728 --> 25:27.564
Happy to help out a guy with
a futon and a bottle of vodka.

25:28.999 --> 25:31.035
So, besides the bribes

25:31.036 --> 25:33.003
and double sets of books that came out

25:33.004 --> 25:35.239
during the election,
the only new information

25:35.240 --> 25:37.908
we found on Andrada is
from hacking his computer.

25:37.909 --> 25:39.877
We retrieved some e-mails that led

25:39.878 --> 25:42.012
to five confidentiality agreements

25:42.013 --> 25:43.881
that were tied to some
pretty large checks...

25:43.882 --> 25:45.950
over $100,000 each...

25:45.951 --> 25:49.086
all to female former
employees, all paid from

25:49.087 --> 25:50.521
Andrada's private accounts.

25:50.522 --> 25:53.757
Yeah, well, hush money is not
exactly a startling revelation.

25:53.758 --> 25:56.060
It's certainly in keeping
with a man who's had mistresses

25:56.061 --> 25:58.662
and is about to run for public office.

25:58.663 --> 26:00.498
Given his conduct with me,

26:00.499 --> 26:02.733
he could be covering up something worse.

26:02.734 --> 26:04.134
That's true.

26:04.135 --> 26:06.604
And the Philippines is a
predominantly Catholic country.

26:06.605 --> 26:08.272
They might still frown

26:08.273 --> 26:11.108
on a president who
sexually harasses women.

26:11.109 --> 26:13.310
Well, we might as well
track these women down,

26:13.311 --> 26:14.554
try and find out what happened.

26:14.555 --> 26:16.379
They didn't come forward before this,

26:16.380 --> 26:17.381
why would they now?

26:17.382 --> 26:19.483
Especially after getting paid off.

26:19.484 --> 26:21.519
I'm just asking.

26:21.520 --> 26:23.153
Strength in numbers.

26:23.154 --> 26:24.722
If they know they're not alone,

26:24.723 --> 26:26.156
they may feel freer to speak.

26:26.157 --> 26:27.224
Plenty of religious,

26:27.225 --> 26:29.260
socially conservative
countries still manage

26:29.261 --> 26:31.161
to turn a blind eye towards

26:31.162 --> 26:33.931
the sexual indiscretions
of powerful men.

26:33.932 --> 26:36.834
Sexual assault isn't an
indiscretion, Russell.

26:36.835 --> 26:38.636
It's a crime.

26:38.637 --> 26:40.903
I'm sorry. Of course.

26:44.108 --> 26:46.676
I think it's worth a try.

26:55.419 --> 26:58.055
You don't know how glad I am to see you.

26:58.056 --> 26:59.557
Well, it's nice to see you, too.

26:59.558 --> 27:02.493
Wiseass, the camera stopped
working when they dunked you.

27:02.494 --> 27:04.528
- Oh.
- Yeah.

27:04.529 --> 27:06.597
So much for fancy new tech.

27:06.598 --> 27:08.666
Well, you haven't missed much.

27:08.667 --> 27:10.701
I blacked out after they
basically drowned me.

27:10.702 --> 27:13.103
Called it my rebirth
when I woke back up.

27:13.104 --> 27:15.639
Since then, it's been a starvation diet

27:15.640 --> 27:18.776
with no protein, long
indoctrination sessions,

27:18.777 --> 27:20.844
and sleep deprivation...
rinse and repeat.

27:20.845 --> 27:22.713
Sounds like your basic
mind control regimen.

27:22.714 --> 27:24.381
Yeah, like we expected. So, all good.

27:24.382 --> 27:27.817
Listen, if it's too much, you
let me know. We'll pull you out.

27:28.586 --> 27:30.354
I'm fine, man.

27:30.355 --> 27:31.855
But I'm on a quick supply run.

27:31.856 --> 27:33.719
Don't want anybody asking
what took me so long.

27:33.720 --> 27:35.659
Okay. Did you get a look at the bomb?

27:35.660 --> 27:37.428
No, But there's a shed
behind the barracks.

27:37.429 --> 27:39.063
Heavy security 24/7.

27:39.064 --> 27:41.047
They don't let any of the
new recruits back there.

27:41.048 --> 27:44.249
I made a map of the
compound. That's the shed.

27:45.235 --> 27:47.605
It'd be pretty hard
for a team to penetrate.

27:47.606 --> 27:49.974
Maybe we can create a distraction,

27:49.975 --> 27:51.642
you can get a look.

27:51.643 --> 27:52.876
Yeah, that could work.

27:52.877 --> 27:54.945
All right. Give us a little time.

27:54.946 --> 27:57.247
Day after tomorrow, 0100 hours.

27:57.248 --> 27:59.149
Yeah. Sounds like a plan.

28:02.419 --> 28:04.455
Our embassy in Manila

28:04.456 --> 28:06.890
was able to track down all of the women

28:06.891 --> 28:08.626
to whom who President Andrada

28:08.627 --> 28:11.595
made payments, and they all
agreed to be interviewed.

28:11.596 --> 28:12.863
Good.

28:12.864 --> 28:16.266
All five of them
admitted to being paid off

28:16.267 --> 28:20.204
by Andrada for unwanted sexual contact,

28:20.205 --> 28:22.873
but none of them are
willing to come forward

28:22.874 --> 28:24.642
and publicly accuse him.

28:24.643 --> 28:26.810
They know about each other, right?

28:26.811 --> 28:28.912
That they won't be alone
in their accusations?

28:28.913 --> 28:31.148
Yes, ma'am.

28:31.149 --> 28:35.019
But this situation goes far beyond

28:35.020 --> 28:37.554
the usual problems of embarrassment

28:37.555 --> 28:41.191
or misplaced sense of culpability.

28:41.192 --> 28:43.427
I have no doubt that their lives

28:43.428 --> 28:46.662
and the lives of their
families have been threatened.

28:49.933 --> 28:52.302
So I guess...

28:52.303 --> 28:54.737
this idea's played out.

28:56.440 --> 28:58.442
Well, ma'am,

28:58.443 --> 29:00.978
if I may suggest one other option.

29:00.979 --> 29:02.579
And I do so knowing

29:02.580 --> 29:04.682
just how far over the
line I might be stepping.

29:04.683 --> 29:06.517
You think that I should come forward

29:06.518 --> 29:09.586
about what happened to me.

29:09.587 --> 29:12.089
Yes, ma'am, I do.

29:12.090 --> 29:15.492
And I know it is not an easy decision.

29:15.493 --> 29:20.431
But your credibility is beyond reproach.

29:20.432 --> 29:23.434
And the whole world would be watching.

29:23.435 --> 29:25.402
Someone of your stature

29:25.403 --> 29:28.505
calling out Andrada on
this behavior could give

29:28.506 --> 29:34.043
all of the women the courage
and security to come forward.

29:36.146 --> 29:38.681
Is that all, Nadine?

29:41.452 --> 29:42.986
Yes, ma'am.

29:42.987 --> 29:44.787
Good night.

29:59.066 --> 30:01.267
Is that a new pillow?

30:02.192 --> 30:03.342
Babe, when was the last time

30:03.343 --> 30:04.776
I snuck new pillows into the house?

30:04.777 --> 30:06.087
I'm just saying.

30:06.088 --> 30:09.123
We have so many already, and
I only sleep with one, so...

30:09.124 --> 30:10.892
We've already had
this discussion before,

30:10.893 --> 30:12.894
and I was on the anti-pillow side.

30:12.895 --> 30:14.426
You said it made things look soft.

30:14.427 --> 30:16.090
And I said, "What
cares if they look soft?

30:16.091 --> 30:18.400
You got enough pillows,
y-you're gonna be fine."

30:18.401 --> 30:20.074
- Then you said, "If they don't..."
- All right, all right.

30:20.075 --> 30:21.940
All right. It just seems so frivolous

30:21.941 --> 30:24.242
to have all these pillows.

30:24.243 --> 30:25.844
You want to tell me.

30:25.845 --> 30:28.112
I'm working up to it.

30:36.421 --> 30:38.290
Nadine thinks that I should go public

30:38.291 --> 30:39.958
with what Andrada did to me.

30:39.959 --> 30:44.194
She thinks it might help
the other women he harassed.

30:47.465 --> 30:49.768
I think it's entirely your decision.

30:49.769 --> 30:52.170
I'm not just any woman
in this situation,

30:52.171 --> 30:54.139
I'm also the secretary of state.

30:54.140 --> 30:56.541
And there's a lot

30:56.542 --> 30:58.543
riding on our relationship
with the Philippines.

30:58.544 --> 30:59.778
I have to be

30:59.779 --> 31:01.645
responsible to that.

31:03.315 --> 31:05.616
That's the whole problem, isn't it?

31:13.024 --> 31:16.394
We tell ourselves to suck it up,

31:16.395 --> 31:18.263
just this once.

31:18.264 --> 31:20.398
Be better for everyone.

31:20.399 --> 31:24.002
Like now... I'm thinking
about the bigger picture.

31:24.003 --> 31:26.938
But just saying that,

31:26.939 --> 31:32.077
aren't I marginalizing women's
right to not be harassed

31:32.078 --> 31:34.045
and not be assaulted?

31:34.046 --> 31:36.880
When does that get to
be the bigger picture?

31:41.319 --> 31:44.322
It's still just my decision, isn't it?

31:44.323 --> 31:46.825
Yes.

31:46.826 --> 31:48.293
It is.

31:48.294 --> 31:50.594
Okay.

32:01.774 --> 32:04.109
I can't do it. I need another pillow.

32:04.110 --> 32:05.909
You?

32:12.550 --> 32:14.486
What's up?

32:14.487 --> 32:16.658
I got it. My friend got me
the refueling information

32:16.659 --> 32:18.256
Garcia was waiting for.

32:18.257 --> 32:21.192
It's from Luxor Airport in Egypt.

32:21.193 --> 32:24.329
Great. I've got the
manifests of those flights.

32:24.330 --> 32:25.730
Let's take a look.

32:25.731 --> 32:28.800
The Boeing 777 cargo plane
has a range of 4,000 miles

32:28.801 --> 32:30.101
with a full load.

32:30.102 --> 32:33.071
Somalia's just over 7,000 miles.

32:33.072 --> 32:34.973
They refueled in Spain.

32:34.974 --> 32:37.108
So why'd they stop again in Egypt?

32:37.109 --> 32:40.512
I can't give you a logical reason.

32:40.513 --> 32:44.282
Well, there's-there's no
report of any weather problems.

32:44.283 --> 32:48.119
The only reason why
you'd stop to refuel is...

32:48.120 --> 32:49.554
because you're out of fuel.

32:49.555 --> 32:50.989
Looking at the manifests,

32:50.990 --> 32:52.891
the planes didn't have
particularly heavy loads.

32:52.892 --> 32:55.894
What if the planes
were carrying more cargo

32:55.895 --> 32:59.364
than these manifests say they were?

32:59.365 --> 33:01.032
And you're showing me this because...?

33:01.033 --> 33:02.333
They were headed for Somalia.

33:02.334 --> 33:03.835
Weapons do get shipped there, yes.

33:03.836 --> 33:05.570
Where Joseph Garcia was stationed.

33:05.571 --> 33:06.905
Because the CIA

33:06.906 --> 33:08.840
sent him there. I told you,

33:08.841 --> 33:11.720
Elizabeth, we've got this
investigation covered.

33:11.721 --> 33:13.625
There's all sorts of reasons
why a plane would make

33:13.626 --> 33:14.913
an unscheduled landing in Egypt.

33:14.914 --> 33:16.355
For all we know, the crew was making

33:16.356 --> 33:18.259
a-a pit stop to visit
their favorite hookah bar.

33:18.260 --> 33:20.418
Refueling records from Luxor Airport

33:20.419 --> 33:24.923
for the flights in question
show they were running on empty.

33:24.924 --> 33:26.891
They never would've made it to Somalia.

33:26.892 --> 33:28.993
- How'd you get this?
- The point is

33:28.994 --> 33:31.296
that Agent Garcia knew
that there was a cover-up

33:31.297 --> 33:32.931
of arms smuggling.

33:32.932 --> 33:35.233
Whoever's part of it
probably had him killed.

33:35.234 --> 33:37.669
There are over 300 people

33:37.670 --> 33:39.637
in the State Department who have access

33:39.638 --> 33:41.072
to our arms sales approvals

33:41.073 --> 33:42.941
who could have falsified those records.

33:42.942 --> 33:45.376
You want to solve this,

33:45.377 --> 33:48.745
you're gonna need my help.

33:56.322 --> 34:00.024
I know you and the secretary
are investigating Kevin's death.

34:00.025 --> 34:00.992
Or Joseph.

34:00.993 --> 34:02.560
- Or whoever he was.
- Daisy...

34:02.561 --> 34:04.763
And I know you can't
tell me anything about it.

34:04.764 --> 34:07.065
I just need to know one thing about him.

34:07.066 --> 34:09.933
Nothing classified. Just
one thing that's true.

34:11.636 --> 34:13.937
Okay.

34:15.607 --> 34:17.942
He had a nephew who was named after him.

34:17.943 --> 34:19.710
His sister's son. Four years old.

34:19.712 --> 34:21.913
I guess he might have
been his godfather.

34:21.914 --> 34:23.782
Anyway, the kid was born deaf,

34:23.783 --> 34:26.984
and Joseph paid for cochlear implants.

34:35.560 --> 34:37.195
Nadine, I know we need to talk.

34:37.196 --> 34:38.830
Yes, ma'am.

34:38.831 --> 34:41.833
Look, I appreciate your suggestion

34:41.833 --> 34:46.771
about coming forward...
with charges against Andrada.

34:46.772 --> 34:49.407
And I can appreciate why
you think that's a good idea.

34:49.408 --> 34:51.376
But I can't do it.
The timing's not right.

34:51.377 --> 34:53.011
I know it seems like a cop-out...

34:53.012 --> 34:54.435
Forgive me for interrupting, ma'am,

34:54.436 --> 34:57.215
but one of the five women
that our employees spoke with

34:57.216 --> 35:00.718
in the Philippines has traveled
to the United States to see you.

35:00.719 --> 35:03.755
She's in your office now.

35:03.756 --> 35:05.190
I was the executive assistant

35:05.191 --> 35:08.259
for Mr. Andrada's
supermarkets for seven years.

35:08.260 --> 35:09.961
I saw many things happen

35:09.962 --> 35:12.130
with the female employees
while I was there.

35:12.131 --> 35:15.867
Some received money and left.

35:15.868 --> 35:18.969
Some never spoke about it and stayed.

35:20.705 --> 35:21.873
I myself was...

35:21.874 --> 35:24.309
was never sexually harassed.

35:24.310 --> 35:26.778
I'm afraid there was some
kind of miscommunication.

35:26.779 --> 35:27.912
No.

35:27.913 --> 35:30.415
I-I did receive a
payment from Mr. Andrada,

35:30.416 --> 35:33.751
and I told your embassy
employee that it was

35:33.752 --> 35:36.321
hush money for unwanted sexual advances.

35:36.322 --> 35:37.789
But the truth is

35:37.790 --> 35:40.024
the payment that I received was

35:40.025 --> 35:42.727
to keep quiet about something else.

35:42.728 --> 35:45.230
Something much bigger,

35:45.231 --> 35:47.531
more damaging.

35:50.501 --> 35:53.538
I will tell you the truth, Madam
Secretary, on one condition.

35:53.539 --> 35:56.407
Which is what?

35:56.408 --> 35:59.876
You must grant me asylum
here in the United States.

36:02.213 --> 36:06.283
I won't be able to go
back home after I tell you.

36:15.547 --> 36:17.296
President Andrada, hello.

36:17.297 --> 36:19.199
Yes, what is it?

36:19.200 --> 36:23.370
You are a man of many surprises.

36:23.371 --> 36:25.472
That is how I keep my
enemies off-balance.

36:25.473 --> 36:27.507
Yeah. Your friends, too.

36:27.508 --> 36:31.111
In fact, just today President
Dalton learned something

36:31.112 --> 36:34.748
about you that he found
surprising in the extreme.

36:34.749 --> 36:35.782
What is it?

36:35.783 --> 36:39.186
I'm sorry, where are my manners?

36:39.187 --> 36:40.420
How's the nose?

36:40.421 --> 36:41.922
Is that a-a new splint?

36:41.923 --> 36:45.125
I do not have time for these games.

36:45.126 --> 36:48.228
No, I know you like to
cut right to the chase.

36:48.229 --> 36:50.163
So here it is.

36:50.164 --> 36:51.965
You've taken tens

36:51.966 --> 36:55.535
of millions of dollars in secret
payments from Chinese companies.

36:55.536 --> 36:57.527
We have the proof, and
we intend to share it

36:57.592 --> 37:00.340
with the Filipino people.

37:02.877 --> 37:05.779
I am a millionaire many times over.

37:05.780 --> 37:07.848
My people will never believe it.

37:07.849 --> 37:09.983
We'll find out soon enough.

37:09.984 --> 37:13.453
These are exactly the
kind of American lies

37:13.454 --> 37:15.889
the Filipino people will never accept.

37:15.890 --> 37:17.224
Let me stop you

37:17.225 --> 37:18.325
right there.

37:18.326 --> 37:20.093
You don't have to give me a speech.

37:20.094 --> 37:21.161
Maybe I'm wrong.

37:21.162 --> 37:24.030
Maybe the Filipino people
will be fine with you

37:24.031 --> 37:26.500
selling them out to
China to enrich yourself.

37:26.501 --> 37:30.470
Hell, maybe the courts will be, too.

37:30.471 --> 37:32.005
I will not be humiliated by you.

37:32.006 --> 37:33.106
You won't be.

37:33.107 --> 37:36.196
In fact, I have quite
the opposite in mind.

37:36.197 --> 37:38.180
You'll share a press
conference at the White House

37:38.181 --> 37:39.479
with President Dalton,

37:39.480 --> 37:42.348
as befits the leader of such an...

37:43.617 --> 37:47.086
...important and venerable ally.

37:48.922 --> 37:52.526
Lastly, I am pleased to stand before you

37:52.527 --> 37:54.861
to reaffirm our commitment

37:54.862 --> 37:58.064
to the Enhanced Defense
Cooperation Agreement

37:58.065 --> 37:59.666
between our two countries.

37:59.667 --> 38:01.835
Thank you.

38:01.836 --> 38:03.970
May God bless the Philippines.

38:03.971 --> 38:05.639
And God bless America.

38:09.877 --> 38:11.511
Damn fool has no idea we saved his life.

38:11.512 --> 38:12.512
President Andrada,

38:12.513 --> 38:14.034
can you show us some kickboxing moves?

38:14.035 --> 38:15.618
If I'd have been in your shoes,

38:15.619 --> 38:18.084
I'd have voted yes on the coup.

38:18.085 --> 38:20.287
Well, they tend

38:20.288 --> 38:21.655
not to work out for us

38:21.656 --> 38:23.323
in the long run.

38:23.324 --> 38:24.691
But I'll admit,

38:24.692 --> 38:26.959
the idea had its charms.

38:28.428 --> 38:30.697
Well, that's done.

38:30.698 --> 38:32.032
Thanks, Bess.

38:32.033 --> 38:33.567
My pleasure, sir.

38:33.568 --> 38:35.302
I don't think Andrada's too happy

38:35.303 --> 38:37.237
to give that money back to the Chinese.

38:37.238 --> 38:38.939
Andrada will always be a wild card.

38:38.940 --> 38:41.041
We'll see if he's worth the cost.

38:41.042 --> 38:42.842
Look at him.

38:42.843 --> 38:47.447
God, sometimes democracy just... blows.

38:47.448 --> 38:50.449
Hey, good title for your memoir.

38:52.218 --> 38:54.187
Elizabeth.

38:54.188 --> 38:56.122
Great speech.

38:56.123 --> 38:59.359
The press at home is already
talking about how brilliantly

38:59.360 --> 39:01.928
I played China and the
U.S. off one another

39:01.929 --> 39:03.730
to our advantage.

39:03.731 --> 39:06.633
Which was my plan all along.

39:06.634 --> 39:08.435
Sure. Good for you.

39:08.436 --> 39:10.737
I'll see you in Singapore in a month.

39:10.738 --> 39:12.771
So now we are even.

39:14.541 --> 39:17.978
Who, you and I?

39:17.979 --> 39:19.245
You know,

39:19.246 --> 39:21.781
I-I'm actually glad
that you brought that up.

39:21.782 --> 39:24.951
No, we're not even.

39:24.952 --> 39:27.153
But when I determine the time is right,

39:27.154 --> 39:30.390
I will tell the world
what you tried to do to me.

39:30.391 --> 39:32.859
And what I did to you.

39:32.860 --> 39:35.395
And then...

39:35.396 --> 39:37.397
well, then maybe we'll be even.

39:37.398 --> 39:40.900
But if I hear about you "sparring"

39:40.901 --> 39:43.737
with any other unwilling partners,

39:43.738 --> 39:46.839
that time will come
sooner rather than later.

39:48.541 --> 39:51.011
Oh, and, Datu,

39:51.012 --> 39:54.247
when we do see each other in Singapore,

39:54.248 --> 39:57.049
you call me Madam Secretary.

40:20.173 --> 40:21.141
It's a go.

40:21.142 --> 40:23.942
Repeat, Operation Arcturus is a go.

40:43.229 --> 40:45.865
- Fire!
- We got a fire!

40:45.866 --> 40:47.534
Go get an extinguisher.

40:59.079 --> 41:01.081
How the hell did that happen?!

41:01.082 --> 41:02.248
Come on, guys!

41:34.481 --> 41:37.016
You're not supposed
to be in here, brother.

41:37.017 --> 41:39.452
Yeah, I'm just looking for
more fire extinguishers.

41:39.453 --> 41:40.819
No.

41:46.793 --> 41:48.627
I knew you weren't one of us.

42:03.610 --> 42:05.512
How'd it go?

42:05.513 --> 42:09.916
Well... there's good news and bad news.

42:09.917 --> 42:11.651
Actually, it's all bad news.

42:11.652 --> 42:14.254
Okay, start from the
beginning. Did you see the bomb?

42:14.255 --> 42:15.855
No. Something worse.

42:15.856 --> 42:18.358
They got ahold of a military drone.

42:18.359 --> 42:19.959
- What?
- Big enough to carry

42:19.960 --> 42:21.060
a bomb, if I'm guessing.

42:21.061 --> 42:22.562
Or who knows what else.

42:22.563 --> 42:24.130
And, uh,

42:24.131 --> 42:26.999
one other thing.

42:34.340 --> 42:36.576
He caught me in the shed.

42:36.577 --> 42:37.744
Oh, my God.

42:37.745 --> 42:39.679
See?

42:39.680 --> 42:41.780
All bad news.
