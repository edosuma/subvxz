WEBVTT

00:11.261 --> 00:13.472
-Get goin', go on -Get goin', go on

00:13.555 --> 00:15.891
-Take friends along -Take friends along

00:15.974 --> 00:18.143
-Go do it all -Go do it all

00:18.227 --> 00:20.103
We all just gotta unplug

00:20.187 --> 00:22.564
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey

00:22.648 --> 00:24.942
Just like the way Doug unplugs

00:30.155 --> 00:31.198
Hey!

00:33.158 --> 00:34.493
Your turn, son.

00:35.744 --> 00:37.079
Doug? Doug?

00:37.538 --> 00:39.706
Oops! Sorry, Dad. I'm here.

00:39.790 --> 00:42.876
I just can't wait to go to my Grandbot and Nana's farm.

00:42.960 --> 00:44.837
Is that why you're plugging in, Doug?

00:44.920 --> 00:47.130
Yeah, to learn all about farming.

00:47.214 --> 00:50.592
Heard you wanted farm facts So let's set the record straight

00:50.676 --> 00:53.554
This is where most Fresh food originates

00:53.637 --> 00:56.515
A big-wheeled tractor Spreads seeds all around

00:56.598 --> 00:59.518
Then veggies grow Near or under the ground

00:59.601 --> 01:02.271
Fruit blooms on bushes Vines and trees

01:02.354 --> 01:05.607
Grain sprouts in fields swaying Tall in the breeze

01:05.691 --> 01:08.318
Goats in the stable Cows in the barn

01:08.402 --> 01:10.904
Food for your table Fresh from the farm

01:10.988 --> 01:13.031
First we store it in a silo

01:13.824 --> 01:15.492
Then drive it miles and miles

01:15.576 --> 01:17.202
And I said...

01:17.286 --> 01:20.205
From the store into your arms

01:20.289 --> 01:24.293
Now you know A lot of things about the farm

01:24.793 --> 01:27.671
Wow! I know so much about farms.

01:27.754 --> 01:31.800
I want to use what I learned to help my nana and grandbot out.

01:31.884 --> 01:35.929
Sounds great, sweetie, but first we have to pick up your friend Emma.

01:36.013 --> 01:39.349
Hello, robo-family!

01:40.475 --> 01:42.019
-Doug! -Emma!

01:42.102 --> 01:45.105
Thanks so much for inviting me to the farm, guys.

01:45.189 --> 01:50.194
I've been so excited to go, I got this great book from the library.

01:50.277 --> 01:51.904
I read it cover to cover.

01:51.987 --> 01:54.907
Sometimes when I was even under the covers.

01:54.990 --> 01:57.492
I plugged in to learn all about farming, too.

01:57.576 --> 01:58.577
Wait a minute.

01:58.660 --> 02:03.498
So what you're saying is you know everything about farms,

02:03.582 --> 02:05.918
and I know everything about farms...

02:06.001 --> 02:09.295
Do you know what that makes us, my shiny friend?

02:09.378 --> 02:12.257
-What? -The Farming Dream Team.

02:12.841 --> 02:16.762
Well, Farming Dream Team, I have an extra surprise for you.

02:16.845 --> 02:20.682
Doug's grandbot is going to bake an apple-blueberry pie

02:20.766 --> 02:22.476
to celebrate our visit.

02:24.061 --> 02:27.731
Fantastic. Let's go, go, go to the farm.

02:33.403 --> 02:34.696
Nana, Grandbot!

02:34.780 --> 02:36.990
-Beep, beep. Boop, boop. -Hi, Doug.

02:37.074 --> 02:38.492
This is my friend, Emma.

02:38.575 --> 02:40.661
Thanks for inviting me, Grandbot and Nana.

02:40.744 --> 02:45.207
We're pleased as a processor that you came to visit us, too.

02:45.290 --> 02:46.375
Beep, beep, boop, Dad.

02:46.959 --> 02:48.377
Good to see you, Bob Bot.

02:48.460 --> 02:51.964
Hey, what do you say, kids, you wanna go on a quick tour of our farm?

02:52.047 --> 02:53.215
Yes, please.

02:53.298 --> 02:56.343
Then follow me. First stop, the cows.

02:58.303 --> 03:00.556
Everyone, meet Moochelle.

03:02.683 --> 03:04.101
Moolanie.

03:04.184 --> 03:05.561
Moogret.

03:05.644 --> 03:07.896
And Moo-Phyllis.

03:08.689 --> 03:10.524
Moo-Phyllis? Come on out, girl.

03:16.405 --> 03:17.865
She says, "Hi."

03:17.948 --> 03:20.701
You see, kids, these cows are--

03:20.784 --> 03:22.327
Milk cows! I know, Nana.

03:22.411 --> 03:25.414
You can tell because of their black and white spots.

03:25.497 --> 03:27.332
Doug, Doug, Doug. Check it out.

03:27.416 --> 03:31.461
Over here's a rain barrel. It's for catching rain to water crops.

03:31.545 --> 03:34.173
And look, there's a silo for storing wheat.

03:34.256 --> 03:36.300
-And a wind turbine. -Wow!

03:36.383 --> 03:39.678
How do you kids know so much about farms?

03:39.761 --> 03:42.264
Because I plugged in to learn all about them.

03:42.347 --> 03:45.142
And I read this fantastic book about farms.

03:45.225 --> 03:46.643
We know everything.

03:46.727 --> 03:49.688
In fact... today we could be the farmers.

03:51.106 --> 03:56.445
Doug, that is quite simply the greatest idea you've ever had.

03:56.820 --> 03:58.363
Please, Nana and Grandbot?

03:58.447 --> 04:00.032
-We could do it. -Yeah!

04:00.115 --> 04:02.242
We're the Farming Dream Team.

04:02.326 --> 04:07.164
Well, I guess you can try. But there's lots to do.

04:07.247 --> 04:11.084
Yeah, I mean, you'd have to collect the ingredients for my pie.

04:11.168 --> 04:14.546
You'd need to pick blueberries and apples. Then you'd have to milk the cows

04:14.630 --> 04:18.509
because we'll need a calcium-rich glass of milk to wash the pie down with.

04:18.591 --> 04:20.969
Are you sure you can do it all, Doug?

04:21.053 --> 04:22.888
Of course we can, Grandbot.

04:22.971 --> 04:26.266
-Okay. -If you need us, we'll be inside.

04:26.808 --> 04:30.979
All right, Farmer Doug, what ingredient do we need to collect first?

04:31.063 --> 04:32.481
Let's see, Farmer Emma.

04:32.564 --> 04:34.191
It's the blueberries.

04:37.361 --> 04:39.404
Let's pick these bushes clean.

04:39.488 --> 04:43.408
You want them clean? Okay. I'll use a vacuum.

04:43.492 --> 04:44.535
What?

04:44.618 --> 04:45.911
No, wait, Doug.

04:45.994 --> 04:47.204
That's not what I...

04:47.287 --> 04:48.664
meant.

04:49.164 --> 04:51.041
Blueberries on attack!

04:56.505 --> 04:59.383
Okay, lesson learned. You don't robo-vacuum blueberries.

04:59.800 --> 05:01.927
No, Farmer Doug. You don't.

05:02.010 --> 05:05.389
Besides, we don't wanna pick all the berries anyway.

05:05.472 --> 05:07.432
Just the squishy, plump ones.

05:07.891 --> 05:10.894
They're ripe, which means they're really sweet.

05:12.813 --> 05:14.398
I detect deliciousness.

05:16.859 --> 05:20.153
Here you go, Grandbot, the first ingredient for your pie.

05:20.237 --> 05:21.738
Thanks, kids.

05:21.822 --> 05:24.241
Next up, apples.

05:25.367 --> 05:26.910
Wow! Look at that.

05:26.994 --> 05:29.830
They're growing high up on those trees, Emma.

05:29.913 --> 05:33.876
Then it's a good thing, Doug, that I was born to leap!

05:38.297 --> 05:39.548
Here I go.

05:40.716 --> 05:43.051
How does anyone jump high enough to pick those?

05:43.135 --> 05:45.971
You can't do it, Emma, and you were born to leap.

05:46.054 --> 05:47.681
I know!

05:47.764 --> 05:49.683
Maybe there's another way.

05:50.434 --> 05:53.061
Wait, I remember seeing something in my book.

05:53.145 --> 05:54.688
Yeah, check it out, Doug.

05:54.771 --> 05:57.774
These farmers are using tools to pick apples,

05:57.858 --> 06:01.153
like ladders and stilts and that long grabby-thingy.

06:01.236 --> 06:03.780
But we don't have any tools like that.

06:03.864 --> 06:05.616
Or do we?

06:06.909 --> 06:08.702
Apples coming down.

06:14.249 --> 06:17.544
Here you go, Grandbot, the second ingredient.

06:17.628 --> 06:20.923
Excellent work, farmers. This pie is ready to bake.

06:21.006 --> 06:24.760
All we need now is a nice, cool glass of milk to drink with it.

06:24.843 --> 06:27.763
Which means we have to milk the cows.

06:29.515 --> 06:32.768
Come on, Farmer Emma. Let's get 'em into the barn.

06:32.851 --> 06:34.269
That's where you milk them.

06:34.937 --> 06:37.064
Come on, cows. Let's go.

06:37.940 --> 06:39.191
Into the barn.

06:40.567 --> 06:43.904
This is harder than I thought. These cows don't listen.

06:43.987 --> 06:46.657
Yeah, they're kind of "moody."

06:48.158 --> 06:51.119
So what do we do? Does your book say anything?

06:52.079 --> 06:56.291
There's nothing in here about how to get stubborn cows to follow you.

06:57.167 --> 06:59.795
I didn't download any information on that either.

06:59.878 --> 07:04.007
Well, we can't give up, Doug. We're the Farming Dream Team!

07:17.980 --> 07:20.858
Please, please, cows?

07:21.233 --> 07:23.986
Come on! Honk, honk!

07:24.069 --> 07:25.070
Yeah.

07:30.659 --> 07:32.578
Emma, I believe I just scared the cows.

07:32.661 --> 07:34.079
I believe you did, Doug.

07:34.162 --> 07:38.375
And I also believe we gotta stop 'em! Come on!

07:38.458 --> 07:39.960
Stop, cows, stop!

07:40.043 --> 07:41.420
Please?

07:41.503 --> 07:44.047
We sincerely apologize for scaring you.

07:44.131 --> 07:46.258
Does your book say what to do, Emma?

07:46.341 --> 07:49.261
Nope. Nope. Nope.

07:51.346 --> 07:52.848
Okay, Doug. Bad news.

07:52.931 --> 07:56.185
There's definitely nothing in my book about stopping runaway cows.

07:56.268 --> 07:58.812
Oh, no! What do we do now?

07:58.896 --> 08:01.440
We told my grandbots we could do this.

08:01.940 --> 08:03.942
Don't worry, kids!

08:04.026 --> 08:05.319
Nana and Grandbot?

08:05.402 --> 08:08.030
-Follow us! -We'll show you what to do.

08:08.488 --> 08:09.990
Hang on, Farmer Emma.

08:10.949 --> 08:12.868
Go, Farmer Doug, go!

08:12.951 --> 08:15.913
All right, Doug. It took us a long time to learn this.

08:15.996 --> 08:17.873
But if you want our cows to stop...

08:17.956 --> 08:19.708
First, you have to make this sound.

08:29.843 --> 08:31.512
Now you try.

08:37.017 --> 08:38.559
Hey, they stopped.

08:40.020 --> 08:41.230
Not only that.

08:41.313 --> 08:43.732
Some of the cows will even follow when you...

08:45.526 --> 08:48.946
But why didn't we know that? We were supposed to know everything.

08:49.029 --> 08:51.907
I thought we got this, but we don't.

08:52.491 --> 08:57.704
Kids. It's okay. You're not supposed to know everything.

08:57.788 --> 08:58.914
We're not?

08:59.498 --> 09:01.959
No way. I mean, where's the fun in that?

09:02.334 --> 09:05.420
Sure, you can plug in or read lots of great information,

09:05.504 --> 09:08.382
but there are some things you can only learn by doing.

09:08.465 --> 09:10.926
It takes time and experience.

09:11.009 --> 09:12.302
Like our cows.

09:12.386 --> 09:15.389
We've been raising them since they were baby calves.

09:15.472 --> 09:17.224
It wasn't easy at first.

09:17.307 --> 09:19.017
Sometimes it isn't easy now.

09:20.310 --> 09:23.981
But over the years, we learned tricks to get them to follow us.

09:24.314 --> 09:25.357
Like...

09:27.067 --> 09:31.488
Or scratching their ears. That one's Moogret's trick.

09:31.572 --> 09:33.824
While Moo-Phyllis will go wherever the food--

09:34.449 --> 09:37.953
Careful, girl. Wherever the food is.

09:38.036 --> 09:39.037
Genius.

09:39.121 --> 09:40.289
Let's try it too.

09:46.128 --> 09:47.462
Hey, look at this.

09:52.759 --> 09:54.428
Moolanie loves to dance.

09:54.511 --> 09:57.639
Good work, Doug. Now that's a new one.

10:01.935 --> 10:04.771
Come on, farmers. We'll milk these cows.

10:04.855 --> 10:06.648
Then it's time for pie.

10:14.573 --> 10:16.116
Great pie, Dad.

10:16.200 --> 10:20.829
I can't believe all the ingredients came from this very farm.

10:20.913 --> 10:24.374
Incredible fact. Incredible taste!

10:24.458 --> 10:26.543
I know. So good.

10:28.212 --> 10:31.298
Well, I couldn't have made it without our Farming Dream Team.

10:31.381 --> 10:32.674
Right, Emma and Doug?

10:33.592 --> 10:34.593
Doug?

10:37.095 --> 10:40.682
Sorry, everyone. I've been working on a farming digi-book.

10:40.766 --> 10:44.645
It shows everything we learned today. Like making this sound...

10:45.687 --> 10:47.022
Wow.

10:47.105 --> 10:49.233
-Intriguing. -Amazing.

10:49.316 --> 10:50.692
Great job, Doug.

10:50.776 --> 10:53.362
Doug? How come some of the pages are blank?

10:53.445 --> 10:55.364
They're to fill out later, Nana.

10:55.447 --> 10:59.243
Because like you said, there's always more to learn.

11:00.202 --> 11:01.912
Look at all that wonderful info.

11:01.995 --> 11:03.038
Fantastic.

11:03.121 --> 11:04.498
Optable layout, son.

11:04.581 --> 11:05.874
What a smart idea.

11:08.210 --> 11:11.296
Well, that's one more fact you can add to your book, Doug.

11:11.380 --> 11:12.381
What's that, Emma?

11:12.464 --> 11:14.174
Cows can sure move.

11:14.258 --> 11:18.887
Get it? They're cows and they "moove."

11:21.473 --> 11:24.268
Now, come on. Let's get the pie back. Moo.

11:24.351 --> 11:26.353
I guess cows love pie too.

11:26.436 --> 11:27.437
Moo-Phyllis!

11:33.735 --> 11:34.987
Beep, boop.

11:35.070 --> 11:36.363
How exciting!

11:36.446 --> 11:39.283
An old wrench and a pair of worn-out sneakers

11:39.366 --> 11:42.953
gives us exactly 655 possible reboot options.

11:43.036 --> 11:45.122
What should we do, family?

11:45.581 --> 11:49.585
We can turn them into a car wheel, mini-golf clubs, a trampoline--

11:49.668 --> 11:51.712
Good morning, rebots.

11:52.504 --> 11:54.840
How are my favorite robots doing?

11:54.923 --> 11:56.800
We're your favorite robots?

11:56.884 --> 11:58.260
We're doing great.

11:58.343 --> 12:00.721
Emma. Emma. Emma.

12:02.598 --> 12:04.516
Happy to see you too, Critter Bot.

12:04.600 --> 12:06.268
Nice new safety panel.

12:06.351 --> 12:08.437
You mean my stylish helmet?

12:08.520 --> 12:11.440
I wear it for protection when I ride...

12:11.523 --> 12:14.484
Concrete Thunder!

12:15.777 --> 12:16.945
Boom.

12:19.364 --> 12:21.533
It's my bicycle. See?

12:21.617 --> 12:25.037
It's got beads on the wheels that sound like rain when they turn,

12:25.120 --> 12:29.499
colorful streamers that streak like lightning,

12:29.583 --> 12:31.376
a little basket for my teddy.

12:31.460 --> 12:36.757
Better check the weather 'cause this bicycle is a perfect storm.

12:36.840 --> 12:39.301
And I'm the thunder!

12:42.888 --> 12:43.972
So what's it for?

12:44.056 --> 12:46.350
I better plug in and find out.

12:48.602 --> 12:52.022
These are the spokes They fan all around

12:52.105 --> 12:55.817
The rim and the tire Tread along the ground

12:55.901 --> 12:59.404
Two tires on a bike Connected by a chain

12:59.488 --> 13:00.906
All assembled neatly

13:00.989 --> 13:03.242
-On a safe and sturdy frame -Come on.

13:03.325 --> 13:06.995
Sitting here on top on this comfy seat

13:07.079 --> 13:10.415
Adjusted to your height Steady pedals with your feet

13:10.499 --> 13:11.959
Add some fancy handlebars

13:12.042 --> 13:13.710
Firm up your grip Elbows apart

13:13.794 --> 13:15.796
Look straight ahead Kick off to start

13:15.879 --> 13:18.715
Whoa, this is pretty hard

13:19.633 --> 13:21.260
We're riding bikes

13:23.220 --> 13:26.974
Gonna get there faster Wind is blowing through my hair

13:27.057 --> 13:28.600
We're riding bikes

13:30.477 --> 13:33.814
Exercise and transport Bikes will get us there

13:36.441 --> 13:38.694
So a bicycle is a vehicle you ride.

13:38.777 --> 13:41.697
But according to my data, that's not easy to do.

13:41.780 --> 13:45.993
So I have a big question. Why do humans ride bikes?

13:46.076 --> 13:48.287
To feel the wind in your hair, Doug.

13:48.370 --> 13:51.248
To see the world pass you by as you pedal.

13:51.331 --> 13:54.418
To get that thrill when rubber meets the road.

13:54.501 --> 13:56.336
-When rubber meets the-- -Do you know what?

13:56.420 --> 13:59.173
You'll just have to learn to ride a bike and see for yourself.

13:59.256 --> 14:00.674
-Really? -Totally!

14:00.757 --> 14:02.759
And I'm gonna teach ya.

14:02.843 --> 14:05.304
Time to unplug and get riding.

14:05.387 --> 14:07.556
Only, I don't have a bike to ride.

14:08.974 --> 14:10.976
You do now, son!

14:13.103 --> 14:16.440
We rebooted it for you out of those old wrenches and shoes.

14:16.523 --> 14:17.774
Thanks, Mom and Dad.

14:17.858 --> 14:20.986
I can't bot-lieve it! I have my own bike!

14:21.069 --> 14:24.489
You sure do, Doug. Now let's Dougify it!

14:24.573 --> 14:26.533
Robots, if you please.

14:29.328 --> 14:32.789
Introducing Doug's new bike!

14:32.873 --> 14:35.250
Doug, what's the name of your new bike?

14:36.001 --> 14:37.461
The Robo-Racer?

14:37.544 --> 14:39.087
Yeah.

14:39.171 --> 14:41.632
The Robo-Racer!

14:41.715 --> 14:44.635
-Wow! Two wheels. -Yeah!

14:46.803 --> 14:47.804
Okay.

14:47.888 --> 14:51.767
Prepare yourself, Doug, for I'm gonna teach you how to ride a bike.

14:51.850 --> 14:57.064
And rest assured, you're in good hands, my shiny friend, because I never fall.

14:58.315 --> 15:01.151
We'll start with pedaling, and then moving on to balancing,

15:01.235 --> 15:03.195
then turning, and then stopping.

15:04.112 --> 15:05.822
Like so.

15:06.907 --> 15:10.077
Thank you. Now let's do this!

15:11.411 --> 15:13.997
-First step, pedaling. -Pedaling?

15:14.081 --> 15:17.084
Yup. I'm gonna hold on to your bike and run next to you

15:17.167 --> 15:19.670
so you can get used to pedaling. Ready?

15:19.753 --> 15:21.630
Put your metal to the pedal.

15:25.133 --> 15:28.220
Okay, that's enough metal on pedal, Doug.

15:28.303 --> 15:30.389
Jenny, can you help?

15:30.472 --> 15:32.516
Of course I can help, Emma.

15:32.599 --> 15:35.102
If you need fast, you call Droneberg.

15:38.021 --> 15:40.774
Thanks, Jenny! I can feel that wind.

15:40.858 --> 15:42.901
I'm pedaling!

15:44.361 --> 15:46.405
You sure are, my shiny friend,

15:46.488 --> 15:49.116
which means you're ready for the next step.

15:50.784 --> 15:52.494
Balancing on your own.

15:52.578 --> 15:54.955
I'll be honest with you, Doug, this is the--

15:57.207 --> 15:59.084
Shakiest step of all.

16:00.085 --> 16:01.628
That does seem shaky.

16:01.712 --> 16:03.839
So why don't I use my robo-level?

16:04.923 --> 16:07.676
It's programmed to help me stay perfectly balanced.

16:07.759 --> 16:10.637
See? If I lean too far to this side,

16:10.721 --> 16:13.140
the dot moves and tells me I'm about to tip over.

16:13.974 --> 16:15.100
Same for this side.

16:15.684 --> 16:17.728
Nice!

16:17.811 --> 16:21.190
With robo-tools like those, you can never fall like me.

16:27.029 --> 16:29.323
Wow! I think I've got the hang of this!

16:31.783 --> 16:34.453
Another perfectly safe day at Rebots.

16:34.536 --> 16:36.038
Excuse me, Safety Bot.

16:36.121 --> 16:38.415
Look out! I'm coming through!

16:38.498 --> 16:41.502
Well, of course. Let me safely move out of the way.

16:41.585 --> 16:43.837
Only, which way?

16:43.921 --> 16:46.965
Doug, we're skipping to step three, steering!

16:47.716 --> 16:51.178
Use your handlebars to steer around Safety Bot!

16:56.058 --> 16:59.478
I did it, Emma! I'm steering and pedaling!

16:59.561 --> 17:04.316
Learning two steps at once? I've never seen anything like it!

17:04.398 --> 17:07.319
-I am one good teacher. -Beep, boop!

17:07.778 --> 17:12.532
That's as close to danger as I ever want to get.

17:14.535 --> 17:15.868
I'm okay!

17:16.328 --> 17:18.789
All right, Doug. You're three steps down.

17:18.872 --> 17:20.999
Ready to crush the next one?

17:21.083 --> 17:23.042
Sure. Should I call Crush Bot?

17:23.460 --> 17:24.545
I'm crushing it.

17:28.048 --> 17:30.467
Not that kind of crushing.

17:30.551 --> 17:32.678
I mean you would do great at it.

17:33.053 --> 17:34.388
It's stopping.

17:34.471 --> 17:35.514
Stopping?

17:36.598 --> 17:37.683
I know!

17:39.768 --> 17:41.979
Stopping system activated.

17:44.606 --> 17:45.649
Did I crush it?

17:45.732 --> 17:50.153
Kinda, but next time you can just squeeze these brake levers to stop.

17:51.154 --> 17:54.032
You got it. Squeeze till you stop.

17:54.116 --> 17:56.451
Now it's time for the final step,

17:56.535 --> 18:01.415
right after we do a celebratory dance break!

18:09.756 --> 18:11.633
Let's go over the checklist.

18:11.717 --> 18:15.762
You've nailed pedaling, rocked balancing.

18:15.846 --> 18:17.598
And crushed steering.

18:19.266 --> 18:22.352
Now it's time to put it all together.

18:22.436 --> 18:26.565
I can feel it in my programming, Emma. I'm gonna ride this bike.

18:26.648 --> 18:27.649
Yeah, you are.

18:27.733 --> 18:32.154
And I'll be riding next to you every pedal of the way.

18:32.237 --> 18:36.700
Let's go, Concrete Thunder!

18:38.035 --> 18:40.662
And Robo-Racer!

18:45.542 --> 18:46.960
I almost got it, Emma.

18:47.377 --> 18:49.671
Almost-riding-your-bike high five!

18:53.967 --> 18:56.470
Emma! Are you okay?

18:56.553 --> 18:58.222
Yeah, I'm okay.

18:58.305 --> 19:04.603
It's just that I never fall, at least, not in a really, really long time.

19:04.686 --> 19:05.854
That's all right.

19:05.938 --> 19:07.022
Here you go, Emma.

19:07.105 --> 19:09.358
Come on, we can get back on our bikes.

19:11.318 --> 19:12.486
I don't know, Doug.

19:14.780 --> 19:15.781
Beep?

19:17.032 --> 19:19.159
-I don't know, Critter Bot. -Beep!

19:21.703 --> 19:23.288
I fell off my bike.

19:25.916 --> 19:27.751
Now I'm scared to get back on.

19:29.127 --> 19:33.173
I don't wanna tell Doug 'cause I don't wanna stop him from riding.

19:35.717 --> 19:36.969
Thanks, little bot.

19:38.971 --> 19:40.514
Emma. Emma.

19:42.140 --> 19:46.061
Time to put all my steps together and finally ride this bike.

19:46.144 --> 19:47.938
All right, everybody!

19:48.021 --> 19:51.233
-See you on the other side of the path. -Keep biking, son!

19:51.316 --> 19:53.193
-Don't stop now, Doug! -That's one fast bot.

19:53.277 --> 19:54.820
You're crushing it!

19:54.903 --> 19:57.573
Pedal. Steer. Balance.

19:59.032 --> 20:00.826
Stop and...

20:00.909 --> 20:02.828
Keep biking, son!

20:02.911 --> 20:04.162
I'm riding my bike.

20:04.788 --> 20:06.248
This is amazing!

20:06.331 --> 20:08.500
I can feel the wind in my gears,

20:08.584 --> 20:11.795
see the world passing me by as I pedal.

20:12.546 --> 20:14.923
The feeling when rubber meets the road.

20:15.007 --> 20:18.260
Emma, I totally get why humans ride bikes now.

20:18.343 --> 20:19.595
-You do? -Yeah.

20:19.678 --> 20:23.682
It makes all the time and effort and even the falls worth it.

20:23.765 --> 20:25.017
Come on and join me.

20:25.934 --> 20:27.352
Well, actually, Doug...

20:28.103 --> 20:29.104
Boop, beep.

20:30.397 --> 20:31.732
I'm a little scared.

20:32.774 --> 20:34.943
Are your caution sensors going off?

20:35.027 --> 20:36.737
Yeah, kinda.

20:36.820 --> 20:40.449
It was the fall. It made me not wanna get back on my bike.

20:40.532 --> 20:44.328
We don't have to ride today, Emma. We could do something else.

20:52.544 --> 20:55.172
Well, I do love to ride.

20:55.672 --> 21:00.928
And seeing you ride, Doug, makes me want to feel the wind in my hair again.

21:01.011 --> 21:05.849
But if I'm gonna get back on that seat, I'm gonna need a little help.

21:08.143 --> 21:09.228
Ready, Emma?

21:09.311 --> 21:10.646
I think so.

21:10.729 --> 21:11.730
Ready, Jenny?

21:11.813 --> 21:14.233
I'm programmed ready, Doug-o.

21:15.859 --> 21:17.277
Okay, here goes.

21:17.736 --> 21:19.780
Let's roll, Concrete Thunder.

21:22.866 --> 21:27.663
Ejecting in five, four, three, two, one.

21:32.876 --> 21:34.461
You're riding again, Emma!

21:34.545 --> 21:38.006
The lightning is back on the thunder!

21:43.178 --> 21:46.765
Grab Robo-Racer, Doug, 'cause we're going for a ride.

21:48.809 --> 21:51.019
I have an idea! Let's all go!

21:53.397 --> 21:54.648
Yay!

21:59.736 --> 22:03.448
Remember, bot, it's pedal, balance, steer, and stop.

22:04.366 --> 22:06.618
Check that robo-level, Mr. Bot.

22:06.702 --> 22:08.912
Is that what that is? I can feel it.

22:09.997 --> 22:12.624
-Here we go! -Yeah.

22:16.420 --> 22:20.048
Wow! What a special day! Thanks for teaching me how to ride, Emma.

22:20.716 --> 22:23.886
Thank you for getting me back on my bike, Doug.

22:23.969 --> 22:26.096
I couldn't have done it without you.

22:26.638 --> 22:27.806
Beep, boop!

22:28.390 --> 22:30.559
And you too, Critter Bot.

22:50.037 --> 22:51.622
We're riding bikes

22:53.540 --> 22:57.336
Gonna get there faster Wind is blowing through my hair

22:57.419 --> 22:58.879
We're riding bikes

23:00.756 --> 23:04.301
Exercise and transport Bikes will get us there
