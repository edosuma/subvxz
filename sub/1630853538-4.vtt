00:08.704 --> 00:10.706
[door creaks]

00:28.289 --> 00:29.986
[sighs]

00:35.339 --> 00:37.080
-[door opens]
-Sister Andrea.

00:38.995 --> 00:41.258
I'm Father Rodrigo Katagas.

00:41.389 --> 00:44.087
I'm from the Congregatio pro
Doctrina Fidei.

00:44.218 --> 00:45.871
Although, if you recognize
the accent,

00:46.002 --> 00:47.090
I'm actually from Brooklyn.

00:47.221 --> 00:49.397
12 miles from here.

00:49.527 --> 00:51.703
This is Father Bailey,
Jonathan Tooley from

00:51.834 --> 00:53.444
the Apostolate for
Family Consecration,

00:53.575 --> 00:56.665
and Father Stefano,
who will be taking notes.

00:56.795 --> 00:58.275
Sister, we've received
several complaints

00:58.406 --> 01:00.277
of your mental
and physical decline,

01:00.408 --> 01:02.192
and we're here to request
that you retire.

01:05.413 --> 01:08.894
Now, there is a silent retreat
in Upstate New York

01:09.025 --> 01:11.419
that we feel would be
a perfect fit for you.

01:11.549 --> 01:14.465
What we need from you is
to sign this document

01:14.596 --> 01:15.945
acknowledging your retirement.

01:16.076 --> 01:19.427
Do you have any questions?

01:19.557 --> 01:20.950
No.

01:21.081 --> 01:23.866
We just need your signature
right there.

01:26.434 --> 01:27.435
No.

01:29.219 --> 01:30.960
Sister, I want to make clear,

01:31.091 --> 01:33.136
this is an administrative
decision to protect the Church.

01:33.267 --> 01:35.530
Really? You said it was
a request, I said no.

01:35.660 --> 01:38.794
Then I misspoke.
It is not a request.

01:41.797 --> 01:45.409
Who has complained about
my mental and physical decline?

01:45.540 --> 01:47.324
We've promised to keep
identities confidential.

01:47.455 --> 01:49.370
But a guest of the parish
recently received

01:49.500 --> 01:52.024
second-degree burns
from tea you spilled.

01:52.155 --> 01:55.289
And you've recently
been observed talking

01:55.419 --> 01:58.422
and arguing with persons unseen.

01:58.553 --> 02:00.555
-Now I want you to know...
-Father,

02:00.685 --> 02:04.559
it is my right as a member
of the National Coalition

02:04.689 --> 02:07.388
of American Nuns to insist
on an investigation

02:07.518 --> 02:11.087
before any forcedretirement.

02:11.218 --> 02:13.916
Do you see demons, Sister?

02:14.046 --> 02:15.874
Yes.

02:17.615 --> 02:19.748
Is there a demon
in this room now?

02:23.795 --> 02:26.015
Yes.

02:26.146 --> 02:28.191
LELAND:
Where?

02:32.108 --> 02:34.632
You know where.

02:34.763 --> 02:36.243
[chuckles]

02:36.373 --> 02:40.986
I ask to be judged by
a three-person priestly council.

02:41.117 --> 02:46.078
Only then may I be forced
to retire.

02:47.036 --> 02:48.385
Is that her right?

02:48.516 --> 02:50.213
It is.

02:50.344 --> 02:51.823
She's also allowed
a psychological

02:51.954 --> 02:53.042
analysis of her condition.

02:53.173 --> 02:54.783
-I can do that.
-No.

02:54.913 --> 02:58.047
It has to be administered
by an outside psychiatrist.

03:04.923 --> 03:08.710
In the name of the Father,
the Son and the Holy Spirit.

03:08.840 --> 03:10.668
WOMAN: Forgive me, Father,
for I have sinned.

03:10.799 --> 03:12.888
It's been one month
since my last confession.

03:13.018 --> 03:14.890
These are my sins.

03:15.020 --> 03:17.240
Actually, I just have one sin.

03:17.371 --> 03:18.937
I'm here under false pretenses.

03:19.068 --> 03:22.289
I knew you would be the priest
hearing confessions.

03:22.419 --> 03:24.595
-Why does it matter?
-I have written

03:24.726 --> 03:28.077
and called the parish ten times
in the last two weeks,

03:28.208 --> 03:29.426
and they say the assessors
are too busy

03:29.557 --> 03:30.949
to look into my case.

03:31.080 --> 03:31.907
This isn't really
the appropriate...

03:32.037 --> 03:34.823
Father.

03:34.953 --> 03:36.912
Do you know the parable
of the persistent woman?

03:37.042 --> 03:39.958
Even the corrupt judge
eventually gave her justice

03:40.089 --> 03:42.178
because she kept coming
and coming

03:42.309 --> 03:45.312
and made herself an irritant.

03:45.442 --> 03:48.924
Well, I may not be holy
or good, Father,

03:49.054 --> 03:51.231
but I am persistent.

03:53.276 --> 03:56.279
I'm listening.

03:56.410 --> 03:59.369
Okay, when? Sure.

03:59.500 --> 04:02.242
Yeah, I just need a minute
to get my stuff together, yeah.

04:02.372 --> 04:05.462
Okay, see you soon. Bye.

04:05.593 --> 04:07.377
-More demon hunting, Mom?
-Yes.

04:07.508 --> 04:10.772
I just need to sharpen a stake
and buy some garlic.

04:10.902 --> 04:13.731
Mom, Mrs. Kandering thinks
that we're lying about your job.

04:13.862 --> 04:16.517
Okay, who's Mrs. Kandering
and what are we telling her?

04:16.647 --> 04:18.388
She's the health teacher.

04:18.519 --> 04:20.564
Everybody had to share
what their parents did.

04:20.695 --> 04:22.262
So I said that Dad was
a mountain climber

04:22.392 --> 04:23.350
and you were a demon hunter.

04:23.480 --> 04:25.917
Okay, maybe let's just say

04:26.048 --> 04:27.919
that Dad's a business owner
and I'm a psychologist.

04:28.050 --> 04:29.094
Why do you want to be
boring, Mom?

04:29.225 --> 04:30.095
No, not boring.

04:30.226 --> 04:31.836
Just normal.

04:31.967 --> 04:34.274
-But normal is boring.
-You don't want us to be boring.

04:34.404 --> 04:35.840
-[doorbell ringing]
-[all talking at once]

04:35.971 --> 04:37.277
Coming!

04:38.321 --> 04:40.497
Hello.

04:40.628 --> 04:42.499
-Mom!
-Who is it?

04:42.630 --> 04:44.414
It's the guy from YouTube.

04:44.545 --> 04:47.287
Wait, he followed us home
from the grocery store. Come on.

04:47.417 --> 04:48.418
She'll be here in a sec.

04:52.901 --> 04:55.860
Upstairs right now.

04:55.991 --> 04:58.123
-Hit him, Mom. Hit him.
-What do you want?

04:58.254 --> 04:59.908
I want an apology.

05:00.038 --> 05:01.953
You need to get off my porch
or I'm calling the police.

05:02.084 --> 05:03.128
No.

05:04.695 --> 05:05.827
-First an apology.
-LILA: Kick his ass!

05:05.957 --> 05:06.915
Lila.

05:07.045 --> 05:08.525
You caught me unaware last time,

05:08.656 --> 05:10.745
so let's see how you do
when we're both ready.

05:10.875 --> 05:13.443
Oh, my God, how old are you?

05:13.574 --> 05:15.227
You know, you have
a punchable face.

05:15.358 --> 05:16.707
-Yeah, you should kick his ass.
-You're such an asshole.

05:16.838 --> 05:18.274
Okay, girls, let's go
upstairs right now.

05:18.405 --> 05:19.928
Oh, my God!

05:20.058 --> 05:21.190
-Are you kidding me?
-Should just slam the door.

05:21.321 --> 05:24.759
You want me gone, apologize.

05:27.239 --> 05:29.633
[man speaking indistinctly]

05:29.764 --> 05:32.506
-Did she do it?
-Shh!

05:32.636 --> 05:37.511
[indistinct conversation]

05:37.641 --> 05:39.687
[door shuts]

05:41.428 --> 05:43.343
What? What happened?

05:43.473 --> 05:45.693
Mom apologized.

05:51.176 --> 05:54.528
Oh, babe, I can deal with this.

05:54.658 --> 05:56.834
You go do your homework.

05:59.054 --> 06:01.883
Why can boys do whatever
they want, but girls can't?

06:02.013 --> 06:05.539
-I don't think that's true.
-It is.

06:05.669 --> 06:07.149
That guy just said
whatever he wanted

06:07.279 --> 06:08.542
and did whatever he wanted.

06:08.672 --> 06:12.676
Well, I was kind of wrong
to hit him before.

06:12.807 --> 06:14.896
I don't think you were.

06:21.555 --> 06:23.339
BEN:
What's the deal? No folder?

06:23.470 --> 06:25.123
DAVID:
Doing it as a favor.

06:25.254 --> 06:26.821
Oh. Is that what we do now?

06:26.951 --> 06:28.605
-When needed.
-Father.

06:28.736 --> 06:31.086
-Hi. Thanks for coming.
-Hi, Jacqueline.

06:31.216 --> 06:33.784
This is, uh, the other
assessors, uh, Kristen and Ben.

06:33.915 --> 06:36.657
Sorry, we're in the
JFK flight path.

06:36.787 --> 06:38.136
Hi.

06:38.267 --> 06:39.660
You said the issue was
with your husband?

06:39.790 --> 06:41.313
Yes, just back here.

06:41.444 --> 06:44.534
He came back from
a long haul on March 8th,

06:44.665 --> 06:47.450
and he just wasn't the same.

06:47.581 --> 06:49.017
In what way?

06:49.147 --> 06:50.671
I woke up in the middle
of the night,

06:50.801 --> 06:52.847
and he was facing a wall,
whispering,

06:52.977 --> 06:55.371
"Go away. Stop following me."

06:55.502 --> 06:56.764
BEN:
Oh, sleepwalking.

06:56.894 --> 06:59.419
-No. He never has before.
-[knocks on truck]

06:59.549 --> 07:02.291
Jason, the people
from the Church are here.

07:02.422 --> 07:03.814
He's-he's in the truck?

07:03.945 --> 07:06.034
-He sleeps there now.
-Why?

07:06.164 --> 07:08.471
He's worried about hurting me.

07:08.602 --> 07:10.430
Hurt you how?

07:10.560 --> 07:13.998
When I tried to wake him,
he hit me.

07:15.173 --> 07:16.610
Jason!

07:16.740 --> 07:20.222
Hey, babe.
I was just getting up.

07:20.352 --> 07:21.745
I'll get you something to eat.

07:21.876 --> 07:23.355
Can you talk to these people
for a minute?

07:23.486 --> 07:25.357
Want to come out, Jason?

07:26.750 --> 07:28.273
I'd rather not.

07:29.318 --> 07:32.103
Want us to come in, then?

07:32.234 --> 07:33.931
Is there room?

07:34.062 --> 07:36.194
Look, it's got nothing
to do with religion.

07:36.325 --> 07:38.022
I just...

07:38.153 --> 07:39.720
When you're a long-haul driver,
you have good nights

07:39.850 --> 07:41.069
and you have bad nights.

07:41.199 --> 07:42.592
So I'm taking a month off
to recuperate.

07:42.723 --> 07:44.333
Recuperate from...

07:46.814 --> 07:50.121
I was on I-95, it's a route
I'd never taken before.

07:50.252 --> 07:51.862
Mm-hmm.

07:51.993 --> 07:54.865
It was at night, and I saw
something following me,

07:54.996 --> 07:56.345
trying to pass.

07:56.476 --> 07:59.348
Something dark, flying low,

07:59.479 --> 08:01.698
going about 50 miles an hour.

08:01.829 --> 08:03.787
Like a drone?

08:03.918 --> 08:06.094
Well, that's what I thought at
first, but it didn't make noise

08:06.224 --> 08:09.140
like a drone and it didn't
move like a drone.

08:09.271 --> 08:12.796
I pulled over, but it just
stayed behind me.

08:12.927 --> 08:16.060
I couldn't see what it was,
but it wouldn't pass.

08:16.191 --> 08:19.411
So I kept going, and that's when
I saw someone sitting there.

08:19.542 --> 08:21.762
Who?

08:21.892 --> 08:25.809
I don't know. A man.
A shadow, really.

08:25.940 --> 08:29.117
Whenever I looked right at him,
he was gone.

08:29.247 --> 08:32.337
-Were you tired? Sleepy?
-No.

08:32.468 --> 08:35.253
I kept driving, but that's when
I must have blacked out,

08:35.384 --> 08:37.342
because I don't remember
the next eight hours.

08:37.473 --> 08:39.693
-What do you mean?
-I ended up at Victoriaville,

08:39.823 --> 08:42.304
near Montreal, and I have
no idea how I got there.

08:42.434 --> 08:45.525
I drove 500 miles, and I have
no memory of it.

08:45.655 --> 08:47.744
-This was on March 8th?
-Yeah.

08:47.875 --> 08:49.964
Did you stop for food?

08:50.094 --> 08:52.401
No. Just drove straight through.

08:52.532 --> 08:55.099
Hmm. Then what's the Double Q?

08:58.886 --> 09:00.888
I don't know.

09:01.018 --> 09:02.585
The receipt here says March 8th.

09:02.716 --> 09:03.804
You don't remember this?

09:03.934 --> 09:06.981
-No.
-Someone wrote on it.

09:07.111 --> 09:10.680
"Be careful. Get home safe.
Traci."

09:10.811 --> 09:12.029
You don't remember her?

09:13.944 --> 09:15.424
No.

09:17.557 --> 09:20.081
So, what do you guys think?

09:20.211 --> 09:23.475
Hmm, it sounds
like it's a drone.

09:25.565 --> 09:27.349
What?

09:32.833 --> 09:34.965
DAVID:
Look.

09:39.361 --> 09:41.406
BEN:
Hmm.

09:41.537 --> 09:44.061
I don't know, I think it's just
a circuitry diagram,

09:44.192 --> 09:46.063
probably from the truck's
battery warmer.

09:46.194 --> 09:47.499
KRISTEN:
Well, why is it on a sticker?

09:47.630 --> 09:48.979
When they change out
the circuitry,

09:49.110 --> 09:50.633
that's how they update it.

09:50.764 --> 09:51.765
Look.

09:55.029 --> 09:57.422
No, I think
it's a bit different.

09:57.553 --> 09:59.729
-DAVID: No, it's not.
-KRISTEN: What does it mean?

09:59.860 --> 10:02.340
Why is there a sigil
on the fender of a truck?

10:02.471 --> 10:04.168
-Okay, you know what worries me?
-What?

10:04.299 --> 10:06.301
Everywhere we look now
we see sigils, sigils, sigils,

10:06.431 --> 10:07.868
because that's what we want
to see.

10:07.998 --> 10:09.870
I think it's just
a circuitry diagram.

10:10.000 --> 10:14.918
DAVID:
Well, let's find out.

10:23.840 --> 10:27.235
♪ Like we're going
somewhere...♪

10:30.151 --> 10:32.066
So, are you reporters
or something?

10:32.196 --> 10:33.502
No. Why?

10:33.633 --> 10:35.156
Because you don't look
like truckers.

10:35.286 --> 10:37.724
We had a reporter through here
about the accidents.

10:37.854 --> 10:39.551
What accidents?

10:39.682 --> 10:41.684
Oh, just drivers getting tired
and running off the road.

10:41.815 --> 10:46.254
Traci, do you know, um,
a driver named Jason Moss?

10:46.384 --> 10:48.256
No. Who's that?

10:48.386 --> 10:52.216
Well, you wrote on his receipt,
"Be careful. Get home safe."

10:52.347 --> 10:54.262
Oh, I write that to everyone.

10:54.392 --> 10:57.134
We get a lot of truckers
through here,

10:57.265 --> 10:59.136
dazed and a bit zombiesque.

10:59.267 --> 11:02.792
All you do is shove coffee
down their throats and

11:02.923 --> 11:04.620
warn them to take a nap

11:04.751 --> 11:06.361
before they hit the road.

11:06.491 --> 11:07.710
You can pay the cashier.

11:07.841 --> 11:10.147
Thank you.

11:10.278 --> 11:12.454
-You know what I think, guys?
-What?

11:12.584 --> 11:14.195

See if our hacker
turns it on.

39:10.260 --> 39:13.089
[woman screams over radio]

39:13.220 --> 39:15.091
-[rock music playing]
-MAN: If we don't stop them,

39:15.222 --> 39:17.877
the America we know and love
will cease to exist.

39:18.007 --> 39:19.792
They want to burn the flag.

39:19.922 --> 39:22.882
They want to tear down
our monuments...

39:23.012 --> 39:25.232
[hip-hop playing]

39:25.363 --> 39:28.235
-Got it.
-What?

39:28.366 --> 39:30.237
18.9 hertz.
The ghost frequency.

39:30.368 --> 39:31.630
Is that really what it's called?

39:31.760 --> 39:33.458
Yeah, 18.9 hertz is
the infrasound.

39:33.588 --> 39:34.807
It's below human hearing,

39:34.937 --> 39:37.462
but it can cause anxiety,
fear, paranoia,

39:37.592 --> 39:38.724
in some cases delusions.

39:38.854 --> 39:41.466
-Hallucinations?
-Sure, yeah.

39:41.596 --> 39:45.121
18.9 causes the lens
in the eyeball to vibrate

39:45.252 --> 39:46.862
in resonance with
the sound waves,

39:46.993 --> 39:48.386
causing optical illusions.

39:48.516 --> 39:50.823
Horror movies, they use it
all the time

39:50.953 --> 39:52.172
just to freak audiences out.

39:52.302 --> 39:54.479
[distorted scream]

39:57.656 --> 39:58.874
Where is it coming from?

39:59.005 --> 40:01.050
-Do you have a direction?
-Getting warmer.

40:01.181 --> 40:04.619
[man shouting indistinctly]

40:04.750 --> 40:06.621
KRISTEN:
Okay, it's behind us.

40:06.752 --> 40:09.276
MAN [over radio]: They want
to take away your freedoms.

40:09.407 --> 40:10.799
[overlapping shouts]

40:10.930 --> 40:12.845
[woman screams over radio]

40:12.975 --> 40:15.413
Okay, slow down, but don't
hit your brake lights.

40:15.543 --> 40:18.111
MAN: Go ahead and try to
take my firearm, I dare...

40:19.678 --> 40:20.940
BEN:
Slower.

40:21.070 --> 40:24.770
MAN 2:
I bind you with chains of iron.

40:24.900 --> 40:28.513
MAN 3: Wakes us
from the demon of destruction!

40:30.863 --> 40:33.953
There. 50 yards back.

40:34.083 --> 40:36.172
Okay, slower, slower.

40:36.303 --> 40:39.741
WOMAN [quietly]: In your heart,
splitting your heart open.

40:44.006 --> 40:46.618
MAN 4: I saw the beast
rise up out of the sea...

40:46.748 --> 40:49.011
-It's turning.
-It's making a U-turn.

40:49.142 --> 40:51.492
Okay, hold on.

40:51.623 --> 40:52.841
[tires screeching]

40:58.760 --> 41:01.023
Whoo!

41:01.154 --> 41:02.372
You okay?

41:02.503 --> 41:04.331
Are you kidding me?
I'm perfect.

41:07.639 --> 41:09.336
Okay, I'm still getting
something.

41:09.467 --> 41:10.555
-It's still broadcasting.
-[screaming over radio]

41:10.685 --> 41:12.121
There, straight ahead.

41:12.252 --> 41:13.688
DEMONIC VOICE:
Scream for your mommy!

41:13.819 --> 41:15.211
[woman screams, demon laughs]

41:15.342 --> 41:16.517
It's veering off.

41:18.258 --> 41:19.564
Where to?

41:19.694 --> 41:20.652
It's got to be around here
somewhere

41:20.782 --> 41:22.088
'cause it's still broadcasting.

41:22.218 --> 41:23.916
-[demonic laughter]
-Skid marks.

41:25.091 --> 41:26.266
Okay.

41:34.579 --> 41:35.971
What do you guys think?

41:36.102 --> 41:37.146
Well, it's got to be
around here somewhere

41:37.277 --> 41:39.105
because I'm still
getting static.

41:47.983 --> 41:49.158
BEN:
He's laying low.

41:49.289 --> 41:51.857
I can still hear
the transmission static.

41:51.987 --> 41:53.989
He knows we're onto him.

41:55.861 --> 41:57.906
There!

42:09.352 --> 42:12.399
KRISTEN:
Holy fuck.

42:28.850 --> 42:31.374
It's warm.

42:31.505 --> 42:34.290
-So what do you want to do?
-Call the cops.

42:36.858 --> 42:40.209
KRISTEN: I don't think
that's a circuitry diagram.

42:41.646 --> 42:43.212
Uh, Kristen, what are you doing?

42:49.828 --> 42:52.352
Hey, what are you doing?! Hey!

42:52.482 --> 42:55.007
Fuckers, that's my stuff. Stop!

42:55.137 --> 42:58.750
Nope. Not until you stop
scaring truckers on I-95.

42:58.880 --> 43:01.274
Then just tell me to stop
and I-I'll stop.

43:01.404 --> 43:03.102
Hey, wait, wait, wait, wait!

43:03.232 --> 43:06.322
People were talking online
about the Ghost Highway.

43:06.453 --> 43:08.673
-That's all.
-Oh, my God.

43:08.803 --> 43:10.805
It's fucking clout-chasing.

43:10.936 --> 43:13.286
Really? Does nobody have
any real motives anymore?

43:13.416 --> 43:15.201
No one does anything
for sex or money.

43:15.331 --> 43:17.856
It's just clout-chasing?!

43:17.986 --> 43:19.597
Assholes.

43:19.727 --> 43:21.511
You know, I could just
buy new equipment

43:21.642 --> 43:23.513
-and transmit again.
-KRISTEN: Great.

43:23.644 --> 43:25.864
DAVID:
Good. She'll be back.

43:27.648 --> 43:29.519
[Kristen laughing]

43:57.983 --> 43:59.767
[door creaks]

43:59.898 --> 44:01.551
Father, this is
a confidential matter.

44:01.682 --> 44:02.509
If you don't mind
waiting outside...

44:02.640 --> 44:05.251
I'd rather stay. Father.

44:05.381 --> 44:07.340
KATAGAS: We're discussing
very sensitive matters.

44:07.470 --> 44:11.170
Yes, and I'd rather he stay,
too, Father.

44:14.521 --> 44:16.566
Fine.

44:18.307 --> 44:20.614
We received a report from
the psychiatrist Dr. Boggs,

44:20.745 --> 44:22.398
-and he agrees...
-DAVID: What is this?

44:22.529 --> 44:23.704
Excuse me.

44:23.835 --> 44:26.315
What is this meeting?

44:26.446 --> 44:28.361
What is the designation
of this gathering?

44:28.491 --> 44:30.798
The Council
of Heretical Practices.

44:30.929 --> 44:32.408
I see.

44:32.539 --> 44:35.281
Does the Church believe
that it's heretical

44:35.411 --> 44:38.153
when a nun sees an angel
or a demon?

44:38.284 --> 44:39.502
No.

44:39.633 --> 44:41.679
Then why are we here?

44:50.383 --> 44:54.343
-Dr. Kurt Boggs?
-Uh, yes, sir... Father.

44:54.474 --> 44:56.911
You interviewed Sister Andrea
on two occasions?

44:57.042 --> 44:59.174
Yes.

44:59.305 --> 45:01.220
And she admitted to seeing
and talking to demons?

45:01.350 --> 45:02.743
Yes.

45:02.874 --> 45:04.310
And did she also admit
to seeing a demon

45:04.440 --> 45:05.572
whispering to the cardinal?

45:06.791 --> 45:09.228
Yes, uh,
at a recent midnight mass

45:09.358 --> 45:12.492
she s-saw a demon
consulting with him.

45:12.622 --> 45:15.713
KATAGAS:
Thank you, Doctor. You can go.

45:18.977 --> 45:20.674
Yes, Sister?

45:22.502 --> 45:23.721
Boop.

45:30.162 --> 45:32.120
This council takes it
as axiomatic

45:32.251 --> 45:34.079
that witnessing His Eminence

45:34.209 --> 45:36.168
consorting with a demon
is heretical.

45:36.298 --> 45:37.735
Then I ask
for an ecclesiastical tribunal

45:37.865 --> 45:39.780
of the first instance
to defend her.

45:41.521 --> 45:42.783
You'll need a priest
to defend her.

45:43.958 --> 45:45.786
Good thing I am one.

45:54.795 --> 45:57.015
[muffled scream]

45:59.104 --> 46:00.105
VICTOR:
David?

46:03.586 --> 46:05.675
-Mr. LeConte.
-Good to see you.

46:08.809 --> 46:12.073
I-I didn't ask you to go
through my drawers.

46:12.204 --> 46:16.295
And the Vatican didn't ask you
to copy their documents.

46:16.425 --> 46:17.862
Is that why you're here?

46:17.992 --> 46:20.429
-To take them back?
-No.

46:20.560 --> 46:22.083
You're a friend
of the Vatican now.

46:22.214 --> 46:26.348
That comes with certain
privileges and responsibilities.

46:26.479 --> 46:30.265
So, here.

46:30.396 --> 46:33.094
You can have the honors.

46:33.225 --> 46:36.663
What honors?

46:36.794 --> 46:38.708
Eliminating a demonic family.

46:41.537 --> 46:44.149
Go ahead.

46:44.279 --> 46:47.108
What are you talking about?

46:47.239 --> 46:50.285
The drone operator
of your Ghost Highway,

46:50.416 --> 46:54.463
that was Russ Owlman,
successor to this sigil.

46:54.594 --> 46:58.337
Principiculus
Demoniacarum Transmissionum.

46:58.467 --> 46:59.904
The guy in the pickup truck?

47:00.034 --> 47:01.644
Well, not one of the greater
demonic houses,

47:01.775 --> 47:05.431
but still, a win is a win.

47:05.561 --> 47:07.172
We didn't eliminate him.

47:07.302 --> 47:09.000
We destroyed his equipment,
that's all.

47:09.130 --> 47:12.830
No. He shot himself
in the head after you left.

47:19.227 --> 47:20.620
How do you know?

47:22.230 --> 47:24.929
We followed you.

47:25.059 --> 47:26.800
Go ahead.

47:26.931 --> 47:28.541
Now is the time
to get outraged.

47:30.935 --> 47:33.024
We have been following you
ever since you let

47:33.154 --> 47:35.722
that medical student
cannibalize his cadaver.

47:35.853 --> 47:38.638
This house would have been
vanquished

47:38.768 --> 47:40.509
if you had stopped him.

47:40.640 --> 47:42.772
Instead, it continues on.

47:42.903 --> 47:44.644
But here.

47:44.774 --> 47:45.688
Cross off this sigil.

47:45.819 --> 47:49.518
Your drone guy is gone.

47:49.649 --> 47:52.260
He didn't shoot himself
in the head.

47:52.391 --> 47:54.915
You killed him.

47:55.046 --> 47:58.832
David, we're not killers.

47:58.963 --> 48:01.443
-I don't believe you.
-That is your right.

48:01.574 --> 48:05.360
But you saw that he had
a gun in his truck, right?

48:05.491 --> 48:07.232
All we did was dispose
of the body

48:07.362 --> 48:09.060
before a successor
could cannibalize him,

48:09.190 --> 48:13.499
and now his house is gone.

48:13.629 --> 48:16.067
Over the centuries,
we have eliminated

48:16.197 --> 48:19.984
this house and this house.

48:21.986 --> 48:24.162
All of these,

48:24.292 --> 48:26.077
and one more.

48:26.207 --> 48:27.861
There.

48:34.433 --> 48:39.133
What happens when you stop
all the demonic houses?

48:42.354 --> 48:44.051
Peace on earth.
