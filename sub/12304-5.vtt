WEBVTT

01:33.599 --> 01:35.889
Suffered eight stab wounds.

01:36.199 --> 01:38.110
I put the time of death...

01:38.420 --> 01:40.288
about four days ago.

01:46.679 --> 01:49.005
Don't tell me this
is your first bloater.

01:49.078 --> 01:50.573
It's my third.

01:51.323 --> 01:53.991
And it just reinforces
the fact that we are...

01:55.461 --> 01:56.825
we're all meat.

01:58.169 --> 02:00.394
We're also bacteria farms, Ryan.

02:00.485 --> 02:03.036
Right after we die, autolysis begins.

02:03.117 --> 02:04.430
Yeah, self-digestion.

02:04.503 --> 02:05.105
That's right.

02:05.091 --> 02:09.555
Our bodies literally begin
to eat themselves, inside out.

02:09.805 --> 02:13.716
<i>When bacteria feed,
they produce methane gas,</i>

02:14.349 --> 02:15.590
which builds up.

02:15.667 --> 02:17.540
And which causes the bloating.

02:17.617 --> 02:18.243
Wait a second.

02:18.328 --> 02:21.543
<i>You are not going to pop
that body in here, are you ?</i>

02:22.327 --> 02:27.632
If I don't, Mr Man is going
to blow in my nice, clean van.

02:29.347 --> 02:31.430
<i>You want to clean that up ?</i>

02:31.696 --> 02:33.143
No, please, no.

02:45.658 --> 02:46.781
Well...

02:48.208 --> 02:49.620
All right then.

03:02.005 --> 03:02.671
Horatio.

03:02.768 --> 03:04.383
Who called it in, Frank ?

03:04.466 --> 03:05.501
That guy over there.

03:05.597 --> 03:09.110
Lives two doors down. Dog hit on the
smell, started acting a little crazy.

03:09.148 --> 03:10.513
He came over to check it out.

03:10.615 --> 03:15.613
Man stabbed to death four days ago
in an empty home, but no one notices.

03:15.696 --> 03:18.182
First murder on the books
in this part of town.

03:18.276 --> 03:20.990
Not what you bargain for when you
buy your chunk of the American dream.

03:21.077 --> 03:24.160
And then your dream becomes a nightmare.

04:15.578 --> 04:18.223
So i asked almost two weeks ago.

04:18.495 --> 04:20.300
Owners took off for Texas.

04:20.387 --> 04:21.462
They got an alibi.

04:21.547 --> 04:22.401
Driver's test.

04:22.495 --> 04:24.300
So who purchased the house, Frank ?

04:24.325 --> 04:27.003
Well, it's not who, Horatio, it's what.

04:27.158 --> 04:30.571
Some company called Apias Conglomerate.

04:30.705 --> 04:32.491
It's going to take some time
to check out who's behind it.

04:32.638 --> 04:35.540
Someone knew this
house was empty, Frank.

04:43.096 --> 04:44.700
I hear you got a popper.

04:44.807 --> 04:46.482
Biohazards.

04:46.706 --> 04:48.371
That's major OT for us.

04:48.465 --> 04:50.471
Really nice way with words, Nick.

04:51.878 --> 04:55.371
You know, I got an extra pair of
overalls in the back of the van here.

04:56.257 --> 04:58.051
In case you want to get dirty.

05:08.048 --> 05:09.372
What did you find ?

05:09.506 --> 05:11.631
Multiple stab wounds, no murder weapon.

05:11.727 --> 05:14.373
Blood spatter indicates that
he was murdered where he fell.

05:14.458 --> 05:17.362
I don't see any signs of forced
entry, so how did he get in here ?

05:17.457 --> 05:19.023
That's a good question.

05:19.097 --> 05:22.500
The house has been empty since
the Apias Conglomerate took over.

05:26.106 --> 05:28.353
Empty house seems like an
odd place to do business.

05:28.457 --> 05:30.511
Why don't you check out that briefcase.

05:37.448 --> 05:40.551
Yep, somebody wanted whatever
was in this briefcase.

05:43.588 --> 05:48.222
You know, it's hard to know what we're looking for
when we don't know what was missing in the first place.

05:48.938 --> 05:51.231
Well, there's a PDA charger, no PDA.

05:51.325 --> 05:53.302
I guess he had one of those.

05:56.508 --> 05:58.562
He also had a big-time job.

05:58.688 --> 06:01.501
Got an ID on the victim.
It's Chad Bridges.

06:01.628 --> 06:03.622
City Councilman Bridges ?

06:05.606 --> 06:07.540
Yeah, I didn't recognize
him through the decomp.

06:07.656 --> 06:11.403
I wonder if whatever was on
his PDA was worth killing over.

06:38.178 --> 06:41.922
There were no workable prints on the
briefcase.I hope you he better luck.

06:42.675 --> 06:44.581
He did quite a number on that lock, too.

06:44.678 --> 06:48.613
I'm hoping he sloughed off just
enough of himself to get a profile.

06:56.578 --> 06:58.110
You got him.

06:58.606 --> 06:59.501
Gary Logan.

06:59.578 --> 07:01.840
In the system for B&E petty theft.

07:01.938 --> 07:04.393
Oh, well, wait a minute.
Would you look at that address ?

07:05.358 --> 07:07.572
<i>It's right next
door to the crime scene.</i>

07:07.698 --> 07:10.642
Looks like our petty thief
just escalated to murder.

07:25.505 --> 07:27.042
Mr. Logan?

07:30.158 --> 07:31.423
I'm clearing leather.

07:31.497 --> 07:34.201
I  still haven't qualified,
but backup's on its way.

07:36.355 --> 07:37.281
Don't move.

07:37.355 --> 07:38.730
Miami-Dade PD.

07:39.186 --> 07:41.873
Got a nice boat out front, Mr
Logan. Are you leaving town ?

07:41.965 --> 07:42.792
I'm moving.

07:42.906 --> 07:44.362
Boat's cheaper than a rental truck.

07:44.468 --> 07:46.311
I'd move, too, if there
was a murder next door.

07:46.396 --> 07:47.603
What do you know about that ?

07:47.698 --> 07:48.532
Nothing.

07:48.637 --> 07:51.361
We found your DNA all
over the man's briefcase.

07:55.406 --> 07:58.760
I didn't kill him, okay ? I
just took some of his stuff.

07:59.867 --> 08:01.823
<i>Look, I happened to
be going by his house,</i>

08:01.945 --> 08:05.553
<i>I looked in, saw that the guy was
dead and I figured, what the hell,</i>

08:05.628 --> 08:08.102
<i>I was going to help myself.</i>

08:10.377 --> 08:12.762
Wasn't like he was going to miss
it. That guy was already dead.

08:12.866 --> 08:16.260
Did you decide to bury the councilman's
body, but we got to it first ?

08:16.385 --> 08:18.050
I see a little yard around here.

08:18.087 --> 08:19.441
What are you digging up ?

08:19.588 --> 08:22.030
A pipe burst, all
right? I had to fix it.

08:28.728 --> 08:30.991
It's a milky substance. It's almost...

08:31.365 --> 08:32.690
... like wax.

08:32.784 --> 08:34.631
It's adipocere.

08:35.287 --> 08:37.740
Soap formed from decomposed human fat.

08:37.835 --> 08:39.311
Exactly.

08:39.985 --> 08:42.732
It usually takes months to form,
and based on the seepage in here,

08:42.828 --> 08:45.680
I would say there's no
way it's from our victim.

08:46.206 --> 08:49.452
Well, if this grave wasn't
dug for our councilman, then...

08:49.595 --> 08:51.653
..who would Gary Logan have buried here ?

08:52.776 --> 08:54.813
That's the million-dollar question.

08:57.495 --> 09:00.280
So, Alexx, what'd you find
out about the councilman ?

09:00.435 --> 09:03.221
The wound tracts are shallow.
The cuts almost seem...

09:03.316 --> 09:04.270
tentative.

09:04.385 --> 09:06.852
I don't think you can
be tentative eight times.

09:07.457 --> 09:10.203
Or he was stabbed with a short blade.

09:10.435 --> 09:12.273
Kitchen knife, maybe ?

09:12.365 --> 09:13.710
And one other thing, Ryan.

09:13.815 --> 09:17.691
Once our bloater regaid his fighting
weight, I was able to see this.

09:19.878 --> 09:22.323
- Is that a bite mark ?
- Sure is.

09:22.416 --> 09:26.091
And there's bruising, which
means he got it antemortem.

09:26.187 --> 09:27.881
It's on the wrist.

09:27.997 --> 09:29.751
Probably defending
himself from the killer.

09:29.775 --> 09:33.000
Only if the killer was of
the four-legged variety.

09:33.028 --> 09:36.703
Human bites cause crush
injuries. Dull teeth grind.

09:36.735 --> 09:38.362
But canine teeth ?

09:38.386 --> 09:39.780
They lacerate.

09:42.628 --> 09:44.953
The guy who found the body had a dog.

10:02.806 --> 10:03.862
Oh.

10:05.897 --> 10:07.342
Oh, thank you, Officer.

10:07.365 --> 10:08.860
You're welcome, uh...

10:08.885 --> 10:12.400
..., Mrs. Wells. I'm here to talk to
your husband about your dog. Is he home ?

10:12.435 --> 10:15.171
No, I'm sorry; he's at work right
now, but, um, I'd be happy to...

10:15.198 --> 10:16.103
Stop!

10:16.137 --> 10:17.130
Put it back in the house !

10:17.166 --> 10:19.321
Oh, wait a minute.
That's my son. Austin !

10:19.345 --> 10:21.743
You cops don't listen. This
is this guy's stuff. Come on !

10:21.765 --> 10:24.012
You know what ? Stay here.
I'll take care of this.

10:25.406 --> 10:27.392
Put his stuff back in his house.

10:27.427 --> 10:28.841
You ought to be proud of yourselves.

10:28.877 --> 10:31.993
And ladies and gentlemen,
your tax dollars at work here !

10:32.108 --> 10:33.743
And you're not taking my satellite !

10:33.766 --> 10:35.912
Mr.  Nash, get down from there.

10:35.936 --> 10:37.633
I grew up on this street.

10:37.668 --> 10:40.060
You think we're going to put
up with this ? Get out of here.

10:40.808 --> 10:41.572
Go home, kid.

10:41.696 --> 10:42.691
Hey, Austin,

10:42.897 --> 10:45.333
do what he says. I don't want
you getting in trouble here.

10:45.805 --> 10:47.950
Hey, Wolfe. PD. What's, uh...

10:48.525 --> 10:49.662
What's going on here ?

10:49.697 --> 10:50.600
Talk to them.

10:50.633 --> 10:53.865
They're making their way down the block,
throwing everybody's stuff out on the front lawn.

10:53.881 --> 10:56.695
I'm trying to evict the owner, but
he refuses to vacate the premises.

10:56.715 --> 10:58.666
Oh, yeah ? Why are you
trying to evict him ?

10:58.689 --> 10:59.530
Eminent domain.

10:59.568 --> 11:00.461
Eminent domain ?

11:00.495 --> 11:02.642
Those are fancy words for when
the government takes your stuff

11:02.675 --> 11:04.042
whenever they want, aren't they ?

11:04.068 --> 11:05.260
Look, man, I'm just following orders.

11:05.295 --> 11:08.691
Isn't there a way that you could
follow them a little more, um...

11:09.817 --> 11:11.230
respectfully ?

11:11.257 --> 11:13.153
Stash of Cuban cigars right here.

11:13.175 --> 11:15.883
Guy's lucky I don't arrest his ass...

11:15.935 --> 11:17.742
Officer Wolfe.

11:27.606 --> 11:29.020
They're forcing
us to sell our home.

11:29.046 --> 11:30.600
- The whole neighborhood.
- hey !

11:30.636 --> 11:33.000
let me look into this and
see if I can do something.

11:33.185 --> 11:34.683
It's already being done.

11:37.857 --> 11:39.403
H, it's Wolfe.

11:40.405 --> 11:43.501
Yeah, Daniel Wells is at work.
I'm gonna swing by and pick him up.

11:48.105 --> 11:51.301
Listen, I was able to dig up some
more information on Cobalt Drive.

11:51.335 --> 11:52.900
And eminent domain.

11:52.937 --> 11:54.163
That's right. In the
past, the city was able

11:54.197 --> 11:57.241
to force land owners to sell their
property if it was for public use.

11:57.267 --> 11:58.853
Highways, railroads, schools.

11:58.885 --> 12:00.722
But that's changed, hasn't it, Eric ?

12:00.756 --> 12:04.741
Yeah, the US Supreme Court ruled that
state and local governments can seize homes

12:04.776 --> 12:07.373
and, uh, sell them for
private development.

12:07.605 --> 12:10.403
Catering to big business.

12:10.437 --> 12:12.033
Now, our governor is against the ruling.

12:12.066 --> 12:13.971
There's a law being written
to change that here in Florida.

12:14.007 --> 12:18.670
So, the Apias Conglomerate is
purchasing properties on Cobalt Drive.

12:18.705 --> 12:22.042
And the company's run
by a Mr. William Preston.

12:22.637 --> 12:24.480
William Preston ?

12:24.515 --> 12:26.722
The biggest developer in the city, Eric.

12:26.745 --> 12:28.872
Where did our councilman stand on it ?

12:28.905 --> 12:31.311
It's hard to say. He was the swing vote.

12:35.756 --> 12:38.301
Did your dog bite the councilman ?

12:39.126 --> 12:39.803
My dog ?

12:39.838 --> 12:41.461
Yeah. He was bitten before he died.

12:41.497 --> 12:45.661
We can run an odontology sample
for comparison if you'd like.

12:49.245 --> 12:50.700
Couple of days ago.

12:55.506 --> 12:56.990
It  was his fault.

12:57.418 --> 12:59.542
He was trespassing in my backyard.

13:00.378 --> 13:02.462
Hey, what do you think you're doing ?

13:02.795 --> 13:05.112
Just looking around the property.
I knocked. No one answered.

13:05.135 --> 13:07.833
Yeah, well, you can't just
barge onto my property.

13:07.956 --> 13:09.880
Said he wanted to
take some measurements.

13:09.905 --> 13:11.143
Measurements for what ?

13:11.178 --> 13:13.821
Didn't ask. Didn't care. Just
wanted the guy off my property.

13:13.846 --> 13:15.482
So, you got violent ?

13:15.517 --> 13:17.643
I mean, you had plenty
of reason to get angry.

13:17.665 --> 13:18.931
Are you kidding me ?

13:19.158 --> 13:21.910
For what these people are
doing, they deserve to die.

13:25.756 --> 13:28.302
That's an interesting choice of words.

13:31.718 --> 13:33.803
Look, I'm not going to
grieve over the guy's death,

13:33.907 --> 13:35.572
but I had nothing to do with his murder.

13:35.595 --> 13:37.473
I guess we'll see about that.

13:58.975 --> 14:00.550
William Preston.

14:01.197 --> 14:02.903
You must be Lieutenant Caine.

14:03.025 --> 14:04.683
I was told you were looking for me.

14:04.707 --> 14:09.002
I'm interested, Mr. Preston.
Your plans for Cobalt Drive.

14:09.206 --> 14:10.480
Well, you name it.

14:10.608 --> 14:12.601
That is prime waterfront property.

14:12.896 --> 14:14.360
I'm building a luxury hotel,

14:14.385 --> 14:16.441
a spa, three restaurants.

14:16.478 --> 14:17.661
All of Miami will gain.

14:17.687 --> 14:20.570
Yes, by displacing hardworking people.

14:21.508 --> 14:23.102
I'm doing them a favor.

14:23.447 --> 14:25.390
The neighborhood's
not what it used to be.

14:25.766 --> 14:28.351
Crime rate's tripled
the last year alone.

14:28.378 --> 14:31.762
Vandalism, robberies, the recent murder.

14:31.876 --> 14:32.842
If  an area is blighted,

14:32.877 --> 14:35.690
the city has no choice
but to rectify the problem.

14:35.728 --> 14:38.781
A blight that took place
after you became interested.

14:40.357 --> 14:43.102
In my career, I've often
benefited from luck ...

14:43.507 --> 14:44.782
...and good timing.

14:44.818 --> 14:45.872
Me, too.

15:05.306 --> 15:07.851
I got your call.
What's going on, Austin ?

15:07.888 --> 15:09.871
My parents aren't even
home, and they're trying to evict us.

15:09.905 --> 15:12.182
Wolfe, tell your buddy
he's working my last nerve.

15:12.216 --> 15:14.450
You're gonna have to wait
until after the hearing.

15:14.477 --> 15:15.553
Aren't they entitled to a hearing ?

15:15.586 --> 15:17.971
Talk to the judge.

15:23.135 --> 15:24.133
Yeah, an Order of Possession.

15:24.156 --> 15:26.001
Signed and sealed. They got to vacate.

15:26.026 --> 15:27.652
The county is taking this land.

15:27.687 --> 15:29.702
Look, you don't know which way
this hearing is going to go...

15:29.737 --> 15:32.181
Doesn't matter.
Hearing's just an appeal.

15:32.216 --> 15:34.403
Judgment was issued; money
turned over to the court.

15:34.427 --> 15:35.402
We're taking the house.

15:35.425 --> 15:37.630
Yeah, but the hearing could
go in their favor, you know ?

15:37.668 --> 15:41.033
Done 100 of these things,
Wolfe. They only go one way.

15:41.598 --> 15:43.902
Listen, man, I'm asking you as a favor.

15:44.068 --> 15:46.212
Please give this family a break.

15:47.377 --> 15:50.063
I'm at the tail end of a double shift.

15:50.098 --> 15:51.711
I'm all out of breaks.

15:52.006 --> 15:53.742
That's it. We're taking it.

16:01.645 --> 16:03.333
what the hell are you doing ?

16:06.165 --> 16:08.540
Breathe too many fumes
in the lab, Wolfe ?

16:09.546 --> 16:11.791
You just earned yourself a complaint.

16:12.016 --> 16:14.103
Tape  it to the door yourself.

16:29.557 --> 16:30.602
Hey.

16:32.438 --> 16:33.971
It was great to hear
from you again, Ryan.

16:34.005 --> 16:36.620
Yeah, listen, I wish I had
time for small-talk, Erica,

16:36.655 --> 16:38.740
but I need some information.

16:38.768 --> 16:41.741
A while back, you did a three-part
series on eminent domain.

16:41.766 --> 16:43.931
So, you still check out my work ?

16:44.175 --> 16:46.102
As long as I'm not in it.

16:47.136 --> 16:48.592
What do you need to know ?

16:48.678 --> 16:50.252
Chad Bridges was murdered.

16:50.287 --> 16:51.550
The councilman ? Oh, my God.

16:51.587 --> 16:55.732
Yeah, and word is he was the swing vote
behind a development on Cobalt Drive.

16:55.756 --> 16:57.912
Well, Bridges was good at
playing the middle,but...

16:57.946 --> 16:59.870
.. my sources said he was against it.

16:59.905 --> 17:01.690
That gives Preston motive.

17:01.727 --> 17:04.590
And stop salivating, 'cause
I'm gonna give you the story.

17:04.856 --> 17:08.131
- I need you to find something out for me.
- Name it.

17:08.887 --> 17:11.372
I need to know where this
hearing is going to take place.

17:11.407 --> 17:14.430
The city posts hearing notices
where people can't find them.

17:14.465 --> 17:18.849
Buried in a government Web page,
or tacked to a telephone pole.

17:18.968 --> 17:20.800
I can't believe that
goes on in our country.

17:20.828 --> 17:22.553
Capitalism opens a lot of doors.

17:22.588 --> 17:25.702
Yeah, well, tell that to the people who
are being screwed out of their houses.

17:26.464 --> 17:29.973
I'll ask around, and get
back to you as soon as I can.

17:29.996 --> 17:31.513
Thank you, Erica.

17:42.347 --> 17:44.371
Did you page me ? I'm

17:44.407 --> 17:46.322
... sort of running with
something, but, um, what's up ?

17:46.357 --> 17:47.450
Yeah, well,

17:47.476 --> 17:50.303
slow down for a second. Horatio
asked me to pull some old evidence.

17:50.328 --> 17:52.422
Thought it might lead back
to your eminent domain murder.

17:52.458 --> 17:53.272
Okay. What is it ?

17:53.297 --> 17:56.530
Well, there were ten reports of vandalism
on Cobalt Drive in the last year,

17:56.565 --> 17:59.260
and just three of them
left any evidence behind.

17:59.298 --> 18:00.930
We never ran 'em before ?

18:00.967 --> 18:02.263
They were just property crimes.

18:02.295 --> 18:03.823
We didn't think anything of it,

18:03.858 --> 18:05.750
but, uh, let's hope it
leads to something bigger.

18:05.786 --> 18:06.982
You got anything workable ?

18:07.018 --> 18:08.330
No, not from any of these,

18:08.356 --> 18:12.242
but I'm about to check out this
envelope here from a vandalized car.

18:17.327 --> 18:18.783
You got any prints ?

18:18.816 --> 18:21.173
No ridge detail. Just smudges.

18:21.206 --> 18:24.493
That's all right. Smudges might not
tell us who the person is, but...

18:24.528 --> 18:26.571
... maybe they'll tell us what they do.

18:28.696 --> 18:31.890
Can't say I ever swabbed
a fingerprint before.

18:31.918 --> 18:35.313
Well, it's possible to find trace
elements in skin secretions. Uh...

18:35.338 --> 18:38.533
..anything the person touches
frequently can be left behind :

18:38.558 --> 18:41.390
nicotine, cologne, food.

18:41.696 --> 18:44.420
Shot in the dark, but it's worth a try.

18:46.986 --> 18:48.302
Got something.

18:48.826 --> 18:50.051
Tobacco.

18:50.565 --> 18:51.743
What kind ?

18:51.778 --> 18:54.450
Acid profile says it's a Cuban cigar.

18:59.446 --> 19:02.932
That's great. Narrows it down to
about half the people on Calle Ocho.

19:02.966 --> 19:05.201
I'm thinking of a different street.

19:05.377 --> 19:07.373
<i>It's a stash of
Cuban cigars right here.</i>

19:07.408 --> 19:09.870
Guy's lucky I don't arrest his ass...

19:09.906 --> 19:11.520
Officer Wolfe.

19:13.016 --> 19:15.902
We know you've been
vandalizing Cobalt Drive.

19:16.266 --> 19:18.520
Messing with my own neighborhood ?

19:18.638 --> 19:19.642
You got to be kidding me.

19:19.676 --> 19:21.430
You sure about that, Mr Nash ?

19:21.465 --> 19:23.302
'Cause the more I look into this,

19:23.368 --> 19:25.820
the more charges I'm
going to file against you.

19:25.975 --> 19:27.760
Why does it matter anyway ?
They're tearing the block down.

19:27.796 --> 19:28.722
Why does it matter !

19:28.758 --> 19:31.581
You caused the crime rate to
rise. You blighted the area.

19:31.615 --> 19:34.260
You got the city to condemn
the properties, didn't you ?

19:38.008 --> 19:39.720
What did you get out of this ?

19:41.906 --> 19:43.403
50 grand.

19:43.815 --> 19:44.681
Yeah.

19:44.715 --> 19:47.560
City's stiffing me on the house,
may as well get something, right ?

19:47.595 --> 19:49.000
Who made you the offer ?

19:49.036 --> 19:50.042
No.

19:50.505 --> 19:51.650
No way.I'm not saying anything.

19:51.675 --> 19:53.182
- Hey.
- No.

19:53.527 --> 19:57.080
You don't tell me, I got
another place for you to live.

20:05.217 --> 20:06.462
Lieutenant,

20:06.635 --> 20:07.231
... what is this about ?

20:07.128 --> 20:11.343
Mr. Preston, you hired Timothy
Nash to vandalize Cobalt Drive.

20:11.365 --> 20:13.273
Desperate people will
say desperate things.

20:13.305 --> 20:17.180
Well, your pockets weren't deep enough
to reel in the councilman, were they ?

20:17.205 --> 20:19.842
Anyone can be persuaded, Lieutenant.

20:20.597 --> 20:23.251
This city needs my hotel,
and I'm going to build it.

20:23.288 --> 20:26.071
- Hey, Preston! * I
think we have a visitor.

20:31.048 --> 20:33.470
Do I have your attention now ?

20:33.798 --> 20:35.380
Stay here.

20:44.787 --> 20:47.502
You've gotten everybody's
attention, friend.

20:47.817 --> 20:49.300
What's your name ?

20:50.437 --> 20:54.002
Ethan Danbury. I live on Cobalt Drive.

20:56.235 --> 20:58.641
Ethan, you got a family ?

20:59.396 --> 21:00.623
It doesn't matter.

21:00.598 --> 21:02.090
It does, Ethan.

21:02.676 --> 21:04.852
It does. It matters to them.

21:06.498 --> 21:07.823
Listen to me.

21:07.906 --> 21:11.283
That man is destroying what
I've worked my whole life for.

21:11.387 --> 21:13.881
You don't know what it's
like to lose everything.

21:14.185 --> 21:17.411
Ethan... Ethan, I do.

21:20.717 --> 21:22.921
I've lost everything, Ethan.

21:25.196 --> 21:26.480
But what I know is that

21:26.526 --> 21:28.410
if you let this man
destroy you today,

21:28.455 --> 21:30.671
you'll give him a satisfaction
he doesn't deserve,

21:31.046 --> 21:32.913
and I'm asking you
not to do that.

21:40.258 --> 21:43.761
Ethan. Ethan,

21:43.805 --> 21:46.770
I want you to let me
worry about this, okay?

21:47.825 --> 21:48.810
Go ahead.

22:06.707 --> 22:07.700
<i>You see this?</i>

22:08.218 --> 22:09.682
Now do you see what
I'm up against here?

22:09.757 --> 22:10.873
I want police
protection.

22:10.917 --> 22:13.063
You'll probably get it,
Mr. Preston.

22:13.966 --> 22:15.753
Whose get a protection from me.

22:46.428 --> 22:47.511
Lieutenant Caine?

22:52.356 --> 22:53.351
You  again.

22:55.775 --> 22:58.863
I was very sorry to hear about
what happened to your wife.

23:00.495 --> 23:02.591
Is this job, Caine ?

23:03.626 --> 23:07.550
Our loved ones seem to always
get hurt far worse than we do.

23:08.427 --> 23:10.032
Now why,

23:11.507 --> 23:14.672
why would a criminal judge

23:14.707 --> 23:18.721
preside over an
eminent domain case?

23:18.798 --> 23:20.602
I was assigned to it.

23:20.837 --> 23:23.441
With all the backlog in civil,
we just want to make sure

23:23.486 --> 23:25.011
that these cases
were treated fairly.

23:25.065 --> 23:27.123
Undervaluing people's homes.

23:27.205 --> 23:30.152
The City Council condemned
those people's neighborhood.

23:30.258 --> 23:32.571
I set the price at whatever
the market would allow.

23:32.597 --> 23:35.063
Forgive me, Your
Honor, but I think

23:35.178 --> 23:37.162
that you're benefiting
from this.

23:39.306 --> 23:41.780
You know what
this is really about?

23:42.295 --> 23:45.462
Your frustration at not being
able to solve that murder case

23:45.536 --> 23:47.990
that you tried to hang
on me a few years ago.

23:49.388 --> 23:51.643
The murder, Your Honor,
that you committed.

23:52.788 --> 23:54.270
Oh, come on Lieutenant...

23:54.305 --> 23:58.120
<i>Caine, that case was dismissed
on a technicality.</i>

24:01.826 --> 24:03.630
Ancient history, Lieutenant.

24:03.835 --> 24:05.860
I choose to forget
about the past.

24:05.935 --> 24:09.632
The past, Your Honor,
is my specialty.

24:23.678 --> 24:24.272
<i>Hey.</i>

24:24.207 --> 24:25.752
Did you get anything
on the adipocere

24:25.787 --> 24:27.010
from a shallow grave?

24:27.208 --> 24:28.711
I got enough
for a profile.

24:28.738 --> 24:30.301
- What about CODIS?
- Got a match.

24:30.346 --> 24:31.803
Missing Persons.

24:31.837 --> 24:33.873
Marta Argenta.
Yeah.

24:34.138 --> 24:36.823
I ran her DNA against a sample
submitted 11 months ago,

24:36.877 --> 24:37.821
right after
she disappeared.

24:37.886 --> 24:39.173
It's still an open case.

24:39.308 --> 24:40.223
Not for long.

24:45.957 --> 24:47.881
I always wondered when
this call would come.

24:49.847 --> 24:52.032
I'm so sorry
for your loss.

24:53.405 --> 24:54.922
Marta was a great kid.

24:57.135 --> 24:59.021
Not that we didn't
have our problems.

24:59.487 --> 25:01.761
Where was the last
place you saw Marta?

25:03.985 --> 25:04.872
My house.

25:06.325 --> 25:08.693
We had a fight,
and she took off.

25:09.545 --> 25:12.451
Her biological parents
were never in her life,

25:12.496 --> 25:13.891
and she began resenting it.

25:14.805 --> 25:15.992
Resenting me.

25:17.247 --> 25:19.172
I'm so sorry.
I must be mistaken.

25:19.296 --> 25:20.303
But I thought
that you were...

25:20.347 --> 25:21.750
I'm actually her uncle.

25:22.866 --> 25:24.670
My sister was
only 17 at the time

25:24.705 --> 25:26.551
and couldn't handle it...
I, uh...

25:27.307 --> 25:29.972
I adopted Marta right
after she was born.

25:38.658 --> 25:43.602
You always expect to pick out
a crib for your baby.

25:45.117 --> 25:47.370
But never a coffin.

25:52.206 --> 25:53.503
You have her body?

26:03.208 --> 26:03.980
No.

26:06.395 --> 26:07.881
Then how do you know
for sure that it...

26:09.238 --> 26:10.562
I promise you

26:11.547 --> 26:14.142
that you are going to be able
to put Marta to rest.

26:16.556 --> 26:18.112
Be back in one minute.

26:22.626 --> 26:24.971
Frank, I need that warrant
on Logan ASAP.

26:25.006 --> 26:27.483
House, boat,
everything you can get.

26:39.918 --> 26:41.273
So Tripp just ran histories

26:41.305 --> 26:43.013
on the grave digger
and Marta Argenta,

26:43.068 --> 26:44.773
but he couldn't find a single
connection between them.

26:44.818 --> 26:46.533
All right, well, look,
if there's a connection

26:46.577 --> 26:48.281
it's going to be here
on Logan's boat.

26:48.907 --> 26:49.503
Yeah

26:49.458 --> 26:50.591
Like this.

26:51.888 --> 26:53.920
There's only one reason
to have cinderblocks on a boat,

26:53.955 --> 26:55.923
- and that's to weigh something down.
- Yeah, check this out.

26:55.977 --> 26:57.313
Looks like more adipocere.

26:59.347 --> 27:01.672
So that means she had to been
on this boat at some point.

27:04.427 --> 27:05.981
Or she never left.

27:06.487 --> 27:09.213
Look, there's more adipocere
here on this suitcase.

27:20.117 --> 27:20.760
<i>No.</i>

27:53.658 --> 27:55.880
Why did he take her
out of that hole?

27:56.117 --> 27:56.770
I don't know.

27:56.926 --> 27:58.382
But, hopefully,
this will give us enough

27:58.435 --> 27:59.693
to prove Logan's a murderer.

28:00.238 --> 28:01.671
I'll get her
to Alexx and, uh,

28:01.756 --> 28:02.913
and she can tell us.

28:04.435 --> 28:05.132
All right.

28:09.076 --> 28:11.673
<i>I had to boil her bones
to get to her story.</i>

28:11.705 --> 28:13.573
Didn't have a good ending.

28:13.605 --> 28:16.601
Poor girl experienced
a lot of trauma.

28:16.706 --> 28:19.171
So Marta Argenta
was beaten to death.

28:19.205 --> 28:20.211
Argenta?

28:20.757 --> 28:21.472
Interesting.

28:21.507 --> 28:22.880
When I measured
her cranial vault,

28:22.937 --> 28:25.561
I classified her ancestry
as African American.

28:26.116 --> 28:27.773
Well, her mother was Mexican.

28:27.905 --> 28:29.782
Then her father
certainly wasn't.

28:30.047 --> 28:31.071
Based on her injuries,

28:31.108 --> 28:34.221
it appears as if the killing
blow was to Marta's skull.

28:34.637 --> 28:35.550
Any tool marks?

28:35.647 --> 28:37.113
None from the skull.

28:38.196 --> 28:40.383
But there are
plenty other places.

28:41.845 --> 28:44.923
The marks left some
unique characteristics.

28:46.037 --> 28:47.853
You mind if I cast this?

29:01.048 --> 29:03.340
You sure do like your
tools, don't you?

29:03.675 --> 29:05.410
I make my living with them.

29:05.625 --> 29:07.493
And your killing, so it seems.

29:09.078 --> 29:10.921
We found that pry-bar
on your boat.

29:11.067 --> 29:11.722
So?

29:12.266 --> 29:14.431
<i>So we have a few
tools of our own.</i>

29:14.547 --> 29:15.942
We were able to match the marks

29:16.037 --> 29:18.511
on Marta Argenta's bones
to your pry-bar.

29:20.188 --> 29:22.790
Anyone could have thrown
that thing in my junk.

29:22.878 --> 29:24.670
Boat's wide open.

29:25.708 --> 29:27.072
See, I don't think you get it.

29:27.105 --> 29:29.890
When you put it all together,
we know that you killed Marta.

29:33.857 --> 29:35.330
You know what?

29:36.476 --> 29:38.900
If this girl was killed
with that bar,

29:40.098 --> 29:41.883
bet it only took one hit.

29:43.108 --> 29:47.232
First one probably cracked
her skull like a melon.

29:51.457 --> 29:52.810
Whoever did this,

29:54.005 --> 29:55.912
I bet they just kept on going.

29:59.095 --> 30:02.360
Because it felt good.

30:07.907 --> 30:09.923
Why do you think
this "someone" did it?

30:11.638 --> 30:12.971
Got a deal for me?

30:13.197 --> 30:13.792
No.

30:16.635 --> 30:18.570
I'd like my phone call now.

30:29.846 --> 30:31.523
Thank you.

30:37.327 --> 30:38.791
H, can I just
say something first?

30:38.838 --> 30:39.562
Please.

30:40.365 --> 30:43.263
I know I crossed the line
when I shoved Biggs,

30:43.858 --> 30:44.572
and I'm going to take

30:44.606 --> 30:46.560
whatever IAB is going
to dish out at me,

30:47.758 --> 30:49.840
but I got some
unfinished business here.

30:49.918 --> 30:51.593
Does it have to do with
the Wells family?

30:51.668 --> 30:52.260
Yeah.

30:52.196 --> 30:54.691
I told that kid I was going
to show up at his hearing.

30:54.776 --> 30:56.891
But the other reason
I want to go there is

30:56.936 --> 31:00.042
'cause every single suspect in
this case is going to be there.

31:00.385 --> 31:02.192
Mr. Wolfe, you have
to be careful

31:02.275 --> 31:04.773
that you're not creating
a conflict of interest.

31:06.107 --> 31:06.942
I will.

31:09.646 --> 31:11.851
So am I in deep
with IAB?

31:11.965 --> 31:14.392
Ryan, I've talked
to Deputy Biggs.

31:14.438 --> 31:16.533
He's agreed to drop
the complaint,

31:16.625 --> 31:18.810
but I need something
from you.

31:18.928 --> 31:19.522
I know.

31:20.437 --> 31:21.673
No more blowups.

31:24.626 --> 31:27.971
Mr. Wolfe, I may not be able
to help you next time.

31:39.505 --> 31:40.623
Hey, you came.

31:40.805 --> 31:42.531
And thanks for letting us
know where the hearing is.

31:42.945 --> 31:44.603
Well, I told you
I would, didn't I?

31:45.005 --> 31:45.932
Did you get in trouble?

31:45.995 --> 31:47.051
For what happened at the house?

31:47.328 --> 31:48.543
You could say that.

31:49.306 --> 31:50.683
That sucks.

31:51.095 --> 31:51.833
Yeah.

31:52.575 --> 31:53.943
<i>50 cents on the dollar.</i>

31:54.446 --> 31:56.692
You call that fair market value?

31:57.057 --> 31:58.131
Hey, don't blame me.

31:58.355 --> 32:00.572
Court puts the value
on property in eminent domain.

32:00.607 --> 32:02.772
Yeah, well, how are my family and
I supposed to find a new place to live

32:02.808 --> 32:03.960
with half the money?

32:04.007 --> 32:05.341
You're lucky
you're getting that much.

32:05.386 --> 32:06.683
You should have taken
better care of the property.

32:06.737 --> 32:07.911
You punk.
Hey.

32:08.055 --> 32:09.441
Relax, man, relax.

32:10.448 --> 32:11.670
<i>Honey, don't make it worse.
Let's go inside.</i>

32:13.167 --> 32:13.761
Relax.

32:24.008 --> 32:24.783
Hey.

32:26.946 --> 32:29.790
I understand you've closed the missing girls murder.

32:30.335 --> 32:31.980
Well I know the grave digger did out.

32:32.008 --> 32:34.171
But you're still bothered by on you.

32:34.276 --> 32:35.032
I am.

32:35.385 --> 32:39.663
I don't know why Logan want hold onto murder's
body if he's likely downdraft the bow.

32:39.708 --> 32:43.550
Is only one reason to keep
that body and it's leverage.

32:44.468 --> 32:49.011
Everyone must getting paid half price for
her house except for Logan he got full price.

32:49.095 --> 32:54.742
Precisely, so he was hired by someone
had real development to murder that girl.

32:54.807 --> 32:55.403
Ok.

32:55.195 --> 32:56.302
So we're back to who?

32:56.405 --> 32:58.113
Going back to Marta's DNA.

32:58.258 --> 33:00.031
Which samples
should I run it against?

33:00.085 --> 33:02.913
Against the sample
that we already have.

33:10.395 --> 33:12.941
Nick, I've got to go, because I'm here
with the councilman's family right now.

33:13.055 --> 33:14.251
<i>Really?
Mm-hmm</i>

33:14.286 --> 33:15.312
I don't see anybody.

33:18.505 --> 33:19.901
Nice try, though.

33:20.466 --> 33:21.382
What do you want?

33:22.706 --> 33:24.372
Do you remember that time

33:24.407 --> 33:27.753
that you forgot your
wedding ring in that elevator?

33:28.508 --> 33:29.903
Come on.
You remember.

33:30.056 --> 33:31.800
You were getting so crazy.

33:31.897 --> 33:33.661
Your hand kept getting
caught in that railing...

33:33.705 --> 33:35.252
Stop, uh... Nick.

33:35.575 --> 33:37.801
It's not the only time
you forgot a wedding ring.

33:40.186 --> 33:42.250
- Where'd you find that?
- The crime scene.

33:42.296 --> 33:43.951
No, 'cause we went over
the entire place.

33:44.027 --> 33:45.491
Not after the body popped.

33:56.377 --> 33:58.930
If you find something
at a crime scene,

33:58.995 --> 34:00.400
you're supposed
to notify someone.

34:00.695 --> 34:01.451
I just did.

34:05.737 --> 34:06.970
I'm gonna get
this to Trace.

34:07.005 --> 34:09.110
Hey, Nat... Nat.

34:10.456 --> 34:12.101
I still have
your wedding ring.

34:12.547 --> 34:13.952
When you walked out.

34:15.076 --> 34:16.253
If you want it back.

34:34.514 --> 34:37.190
So the question is:
Whose ring is it?

34:37.317 --> 34:38.632
I was hoping you could tell me.

34:38.677 --> 34:41.112
The initials on
here are "J.W."

34:41.585 --> 34:42.581
Does that match up

34:42.617 --> 34:44.120
with anyone on the block?

34:44.737 --> 34:46.219
That's Julie Wells.

34:47.578 --> 34:48.940
That's Austin's mother.

34:54.476 --> 34:55.472
I know, I'm so stupid.

34:55.507 --> 34:56.800
I don't know where I lost it.

34:56.875 --> 34:58.692
Well, we found your ring,
Mrs. Wells.

34:59.176 --> 35:01.283
Right next to
Councilman Bridges' body.

35:03.925 --> 35:05.990
Please, don't tell my husband.

35:06.027 --> 35:07.361
He wouldn't understand.

35:07.437 --> 35:08.110
Killing a man?

35:08.158 --> 35:09.672
I wouldn't understand, either.

35:10.327 --> 35:11.500
No, no.

35:11.835 --> 35:13.191
I-I mean, I just...

35:14.608 --> 35:16.212
I just tried to sleep with him.

35:19.797 --> 35:21.493
He seemed like
the kind of guy who...

35:22.575 --> 35:24.260
I thought I could work out
some kind of arrangement

35:24.308 --> 35:25.691
so he'd leave us alone.

35:26.537 --> 35:28.723
So you had him meet you
in the empty house.

35:37.438 --> 35:38.393
<i>I felt so guilty.</i>

35:38.466 --> 35:40.243
<i>I thought if
I took off my ring...</i>

35:46.907 --> 35:48.442
You didn't go through with it?

35:48.896 --> 35:50.171
I tried to explain.

35:50.207 --> 35:52.180
He got so mad.

35:53.607 --> 35:55.471
Way to present
your case.

35:55.508 --> 35:56.700
Go home.

35:56.796 --> 35:58.062
While you still have one.

35:58.137 --> 35:59.741
- Please.
- Get out of here!

36:02.426 --> 36:04.072
Okay, when did all this happen?

36:04.108 --> 36:05.232
Four days ago.

36:05.526 --> 36:07.202
Same day he was murdered.

36:08.336 --> 36:11.010
Do you really believe that I
could kill a man twice my size?

36:11.356 --> 36:13.050
Stabbings were very shallow.

36:13.305 --> 36:15.400
That's indicative
of a female assailant.

36:16.026 --> 36:18.541
I don't even know
where I'd get a knife.

36:18.706 --> 36:20.611
Grab one from
my silverware drawer?

36:21.146 --> 36:21.933
Well, that's funny.

36:22.057 --> 36:24.161
Funny that you would
mention a kitchen knife.

36:30.307 --> 36:30.933
Yeah.

36:31.435 --> 36:33.511
Kitchen knife could have
definitely made those tears.

36:33.548 --> 36:34.140
Yeah.

36:43.896 --> 36:46.400
Hey, come here and take a look
at the councilman's tie.

36:48.647 --> 36:50.660
That's no accidental contact.

36:51.208 --> 36:51.881
No.

36:52.577 --> 36:54.412
I think the killer wiped
the murder weapon off

36:54.456 --> 36:55.591
on the back of the tie.

36:57.977 --> 36:58.930
Small knife.

36:59.285 --> 37:01.223
Yeah, but it's not
a kitchen knife.

37:01.726 --> 37:03.021
You see that void there?

37:04.806 --> 37:06.991
That's a divot where
you pull out the blade.

37:13.057 --> 37:14.582
Killer used a pocketknife.

37:14.626 --> 37:16.822
Well, that's not usually
something women carry.

37:18.708 --> 37:20.642
No, but teenage boy would.

37:22.047 --> 37:23.072
You can't make me.

37:23.106 --> 37:23.702
Yeah, I can.

37:23.638 --> 37:24.753
Empty your pockets.

37:25.507 --> 37:26.891
I was never near that guy.

37:27.027 --> 37:28.040
Let the knife prove it.

37:28.078 --> 37:29.723
Empty your pockets, Austin.

37:31.198 --> 37:32.872
Come on. Empty your pockets.

38:11.965 --> 38:12.772
What does that mean?

38:14.208 --> 38:16.511
It means you killed
Councilman Bridges.

38:18.815 --> 38:21.323
But... but he was
taking everything.

38:21.935 --> 38:24.681
The neighborhood
I grew up in, my house.

38:26.226 --> 38:28.183
<i>And then he took my mom.</i>

38:44.807 --> 38:46.870
He wouldn't stop taking things.

38:46.985 --> 38:48.382
Austin, your mom

38:48.425 --> 38:49.701
and the councilman...

38:50.655 --> 38:51.671
nothing happened.

38:52.437 --> 38:54.150
She didn't go
through with it.

38:54.675 --> 38:57.581
All you saw was your mom
running away down the street.

39:05.207 --> 39:07.232
So all this time,
you were just trying

39:07.278 --> 39:08.993
to make me feel sorry
for you, is that it?

39:09.206 --> 39:10.572
Don't act all hurt.

39:11.265 --> 39:13.710
You guys make us live
by these laws, but you don't.

39:14.405 --> 39:16.581
I saw you shove that cop.
Nothing happened.

39:16.645 --> 39:19.420
You change them whenever you
want something you can't have.

39:53.068 --> 39:54.820
What's wrong?
You look concerned.

39:54.877 --> 39:56.021
That's 'cause I am.

39:56.088 --> 39:57.771
I ran Marta
Argenta's DNA

39:57.826 --> 39:59.531
from that missing
girl from that case.

39:59.608 --> 40:00.983
Case Horatio was talking about?

40:01.047 --> 40:01.643
Yeah.

40:01.885 --> 40:04.562
It's a familial match
to the suspect in that case.

40:04.868 --> 40:05.462
Really?

40:06.607 --> 40:09.302
And look at whose name
is on the sample.

40:16.017 --> 40:19.762
Marta Argenta is your daughter,
Your Honor.

40:22.346 --> 40:24.051
I'm sorry, Lieutenant.

40:24.107 --> 40:25.771
Name doesn't ring a bell.

40:26.965 --> 40:29.513
Turns out that
Marta's mother Carmen

40:29.567 --> 40:30.973
came through your courtroom

40:31.008 --> 40:33.343
and then visited you
in these very chambers.

40:35.458 --> 40:38.803
Now, Caine,
where'd you dig that up?

40:38.887 --> 40:41.243
Gary Logan's backyard,
Your Honor.

40:45.408 --> 40:47.852
So that's what happened
to that girl, huh?

40:48.638 --> 40:50.612
She did call a few times, yes.

40:50.718 --> 40:52.433
Claimed she was my daughter.

40:52.487 --> 40:54.181
But why should I believe
a teenage runaway?

40:54.208 --> 40:56.423
The same reason
you had Gary kill her.

40:58.406 --> 41:00.321
All right, Caine, that's enough.

41:00.405 --> 41:02.503
I've had enough of
your accusations.

41:02.558 --> 41:04.060
You get out of my chambers.

41:04.096 --> 41:05.961
I hate to inform you,
Your Honor,

41:06.017 --> 41:08.710
but these are no longer
your chambers.

41:09.127 --> 41:12.172
You know there's no way you're
gonna prove all this in court.

41:12.207 --> 41:14.330
Seems that Mr. Logan
held onto Marta's bones

41:14.375 --> 41:16.413
for just such an occasion.

41:16.675 --> 41:18.270
So, you see, I can.

41:18.917 --> 41:21.010
Caine, you ought to know
better than that.

41:21.175 --> 41:22.970
You can't touch me.

41:23.008 --> 41:24.661
Your Honor, I don't have

41:24.707 --> 41:26.850
the slightest desire to.

41:29.495 --> 41:30.870
<i>You are under arrest.</i>

41:30.908 --> 41:31.992
Officers.

41:34.477 --> 41:36.921
Don't think this
is over, Caine.

41:36.977 --> 41:39.421
I got the best legal mind
there is.

41:39.507 --> 41:41.083
You're gonna need it.

42:42.635 --> 42:43.333
Lieutenant.

42:45.646 --> 42:46.770
Mr. Wells.

42:50.848 --> 42:52.453
I can't say
it's good to see you.

42:52.528 --> 42:54.333
Mr. Wells, I
wanted you, uh,

42:54.405 --> 42:56.100
I wanted you to
hear firsthand

42:56.155 --> 42:58.101
that your home is
still your home.

42:59.628 --> 43:00.293
Yeah.

43:02.507 --> 43:04.013
At the cost of my son.

43:09.087 --> 43:11.973
Mr. Wells,
you still have your son.

43:12.198 --> 43:14.421
And he needs you
more than ever now.
