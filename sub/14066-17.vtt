00:00.237 --> 00:01.706
<i>Previously on Boston Legal…</i>

00:01.747 --> 00:03.956
I met somebody wonderful.

00:04.291 --> 00:04.885
Fab. And?

00:05.116 --> 00:08.125
And she's suing me
for sexual assault.

00:08.820 --> 00:11.156
You need to talk directly to her
and hope she's persuaded.

00:11.196 --> 00:12.462
Do we have a chance
of getting back?

00:12.502 --> 00:14.284
Yeah… I'd really like that.

00:14.686 --> 00:15.280
Mr Shore.

00:16.329 --> 00:17.810
You came down here
from Massachusetts?

00:17.850 --> 00:19.850
–Yes.
–You know what I'd like to propose?

00:19.890 --> 00:21.506
I'd like to propose
that you got a problem

00:21.546 --> 00:23.790
with the death penalty
in general.

00:24.650 --> 00:26.921
Now is that why you came
here, sir? –I have a problem

00:26.961 --> 00:30.657
with the state executing a man
with diminished capacity.

00:54.858 --> 00:55.254
Jerry?

00:55.666 --> 00:56.906
Katie. Hello. Welcome.
Hello.

00:56.946 --> 00:58.641
–Everything all right?
–Yes. Hello. Welcome.

00:58.681 --> 01:01.470
Jerry, your face is beet red.
Are you sure you're okay?

01:01.510 --> 01:03.688
–I'm fine.
–I'm not sure you are.

01:05.134 --> 01:06.781
Look at his face.
He's completely scarlet.

01:06.821 --> 01:09.247
–I'm fine.
–Jerry, look at me.

01:10.493 --> 01:11.879
Has he been drinking?

01:12.477 --> 01:13.995
What's going on, Jerry?

01:14.253 --> 01:15.146
Nothin'.

01:15.498 --> 01:16.147
Jerry.

01:20.705 --> 01:21.990
I lost my cherry.

01:31.589 --> 01:34.691
Okay, but first,
I'm assuming the sex was safe.

01:34.948 --> 01:35.608
Of course.

01:36.515 --> 01:39.163
Why are you looking at me
like I've done something bad?

01:39.203 --> 01:41.547
I thought sex was supposed
to be something wonderful?

01:41.587 --> 01:42.841
Well, it is. It is.

01:45.077 --> 01:45.619
Was it?

01:46.076 --> 01:48.932
Yes. It was tender.
It was lovely.

01:50.885 --> 01:53.129
It was everything I ever imagined.

01:54.140 --> 01:55.526
And it was with Dana?

01:56.016 --> 01:58.665
Of course it was with Dana.
She's my girlfriend.

01:58.705 --> 02:02.328
Alan. Ah, could I steal you
for a second? It's important.

02:02.368 --> 02:03.490
I lost my cherry.

02:06.544 --> 02:06.944
Alan?

02:15.584 --> 02:16.513
What's going on?

02:16.553 --> 02:17.552
We have a new client.

02:17.592 --> 02:19.656
He raped an 8-year-old girl.
He's been convicted.

02:19.696 --> 02:21.248
His lawyer has come to us
to handle his appeal.

02:21.288 --> 02:23.266
Specifically, she asked for you.
–I'll pass.

02:23.306 --> 02:26.078
The man has been sentenced
to death, Alan.

02:26.320 --> 02:29.818
The appeal is before
the United States Supreme Court.

02:30.040 --> 02:32.614
<i>The</i> United States Supreme Court.

03:04.360 --> 03:06.584
The argument is scheduled
for Wednesday.

03:06.624 --> 03:08.353
I brought all the files
up with me, so—

03:08.393 --> 03:11.561
This Wednesday? Isn't this
a little last-minute?

03:11.600 --> 03:13.784
Well, the truth is,
I planned to argue it myself,

03:13.824 --> 03:15.440
but I've tried three cases
in my life,

03:15.480 --> 03:17.752
and I'm not ready
for the Supreme Court.

03:17.792 --> 03:19.112
And you think he is?

03:19.136 --> 03:21.438
I've read the transcript
from his death case in Texas.

03:21.478 --> 03:23.326
You're what I'm looking for.

03:23.942 --> 03:25.822
I have a flight waiting
to Louisiana.

03:25.862 --> 03:28.782
That's where the client is.
I'd like for you to meet him.

03:28.822 --> 03:29.262
I ca—

03:31.646 --> 03:32.782
Did he do it?

03:33.206 --> 03:35.978
He says he didn't.
He has an IQ of 70, so…

03:36.333 --> 03:38.174
Well, executions
of the mentally disabled

03:38.214 --> 03:41.429
are unconstitutional—
–He was never officially pronounced disabled.

03:41.469 --> 03:44.270
A 70 IQ only puts him
in range, but in Louisiana—

03:44.310 --> 03:45.960
Oh, he could be governor.

03:46.342 --> 03:47.596
I'm from Louisiana.

03:48.807 --> 03:49.467
I'm sorry.

03:50.070 --> 03:51.695
It's just when it comes
to jokes or women,

03:51.735 --> 03:53.979
I can never resist
the cheap ones.

03:54.759 --> 03:57.878
Are you cheap?
–After you meet the client,

03:58.190 --> 04:00.038
I've arranged for the mooters
to be here tonight.

04:00.078 --> 04:02.894
–The mooters? –A law firm that preps
lawyers to argue before the supreme court.

04:02.934 --> 04:05.178
Most have argued
there themselves,

04:05.254 --> 04:06.554
clerked for the justices.

04:06.594 --> 04:08.826
They'll tell you how they think,
how each one will likely vote.

04:08.866 --> 04:10.210
They'll put you through
a mini boot camp

04:10.250 --> 04:13.220
to make sure you're ready.
–In just two days?

04:14.106 --> 04:15.228
In just two days.

04:18.529 --> 04:20.065
Fired up? Ready to go?

04:36.306 --> 04:37.482
The fact
that the supreme court

04:37.522 --> 04:39.106
is even willing
to listen to your case

04:39.146 --> 04:40.532
is a very good thing.

04:41.138 --> 04:42.590
Will I get to go home?

04:44.028 --> 04:45.483
No, Lenny.

04:45.962 --> 04:47.810
You— you'll probably never
get to go home.

04:47.850 --> 04:49.499
I explained this. This is…

04:49.539 --> 04:52.475
Well, uh, to stop them
from executing you.

04:54.587 --> 04:57.370
I never was arrested
for a crime before.

04:58.122 --> 04:59.130
You can check.

05:00.003 --> 05:03.501
I never, ever been arrested
or convicted of anything.

05:04.003 --> 05:05.514
Will you tell them that?

05:05.554 --> 05:06.034
I will.

05:06.978 --> 05:10.202
And I didn't do what
they said I did. I promise.

05:11.812 --> 05:13.726
Make sure
you tell them that.

05:14.178 --> 05:15.762
That's really important.

05:17.067 --> 05:19.186
That's really… important.

05:33.656 --> 05:34.250
Call her?

05:35.174 --> 05:36.879
Well, it wouldn't be
the worst idea.

05:36.919 --> 05:38.107
What should I say?

05:38.671 --> 05:41.478
Well, perhaps exactly what
you shared with Alan and me,

05:41.518 --> 05:44.478
that you found it tender,
loving… magical.

05:45.422 --> 05:45.846
Okay.

05:49.551 --> 05:51.663
–Hi, Jey.
–Dana, hello. Welcome.

05:51.791 --> 05:54.230
I was just about to call you
to tell you the sex was tender,

05:54.270 --> 05:55.524
loving and magical.

06:00.000 --> 06:01.584
I'm sorry.
–That's okay.

06:02.934 --> 06:04.716
I'll give you some privacy.

06:09.503 --> 06:12.407
I just came by to say
the same thing, Jerry.

06:14.255 --> 06:16.623
Last night was
really special for me.

06:16.663 --> 06:17.518
It was?

06:17.966 --> 06:20.664
It was everything
that making love should be.

06:20.704 --> 06:22.552
You were caring, respectful.

06:24.425 --> 06:25.943
You're a wonderful man.

06:27.935 --> 06:29.585
You're a wonderful woman.

06:49.031 --> 06:49.757
What a day.

06:51.718 --> 06:53.236
It isn't even over yet.

07:02.487 --> 07:03.191
What?

07:04.455 --> 07:06.039
Little field trip, Alan?

07:07.654 --> 07:08.886
You think you're going

07:08.926 --> 07:10.831
to the supreme court
without me?

07:10.871 --> 07:14.422
–Denny, this isn't your kind of case.
–If it's before the supreme court,

07:14.462 --> 07:15.447
it's my kind of case.

07:15.487 --> 07:16.575
The client raped a child.

07:16.615 --> 07:19.321
It's not about the client.
It's about me.

07:19.399 --> 07:21.087
–Denny—
–The only thing missing from my legacy

07:21.127 --> 07:22.999
is an appearance before
the highest court in the land.

07:23.039 --> 07:25.774
My best friend has the power
to make that happen,

07:25.814 --> 07:27.266
and he didn't tell me.

07:28.942 --> 07:30.350
Denny,
the supreme court

07:30.390 --> 07:32.502
isn't the place
for my nonsense,

07:32.583 --> 07:34.855
much less… yours.

07:37.103 --> 07:37.961
I can behave.

07:38.847 --> 07:40.127
I can suck it up
one more time,

07:40.167 --> 07:42.939
like I did for my murder trial
in January,

07:43.006 --> 07:45.580
when I rose up
and proved to the world…

07:46.054 --> 07:47.902
I won that, right?
–You did.

07:48.971 --> 07:49.723
Alan…

07:50.965 --> 07:52.059
please.

07:53.011 --> 07:55.267
I have actually
dreamed about this

07:56.219 --> 07:57.473
more than anything.

07:58.978 --> 08:00.386
You've never told me that.

08:00.426 --> 08:02.394
Well, I never thought
I'd have the chance.

08:02.434 --> 08:05.283
And… well,
I guess I never wanted

08:05.603 --> 08:06.627
to admit to myself

08:06.667 --> 08:09.703
that there was anything
I hadn't accomplished.

08:10.131 --> 08:13.235
But… to have the chance,
my God,

08:13.539 --> 08:16.715
you and I,
to do this together…

08:21.873 --> 08:23.523
That would be everything.

08:25.517 --> 08:27.386
Are you out of your mind?

08:27.753 --> 08:29.232
Look, if I do
all the talking—

08:29.272 --> 08:31.723
Denny Crane before
the supreme court?

08:32.352 --> 08:33.585
We could sell tickets.

08:33.625 --> 08:36.440
Alan… this is not the time,

08:37.073 --> 08:39.505
and certainly,
definitely not the place.

08:39.544 --> 08:41.591
How much harm
can he really do?

08:42.400 --> 08:44.481
Carl, I'll be doing
all the arguing.

08:44.521 --> 08:46.712
Yes, and as your back
is turned to Denny

08:46.752 --> 08:47.808
while you argue,

08:48.232 --> 08:51.136
who's gonna make sure
he keeps his pants up?

08:57.327 --> 08:58.463
You got plans?

09:10.854 --> 09:13.022
Lorraine. Hello.
Welcome. Lips!

09:14.471 --> 09:14.896
Dana?

09:15.470 --> 09:16.615
Lorraine. Hello.

09:17.615 --> 09:19.199
You two know each other?

09:19.359 --> 09:19.755
We do.

09:20.479 --> 09:22.551
Uh, we work out
at the same gym.

09:22.591 --> 09:25.957
–How are you two acquainted?
–Dana's my girlfriend.

09:25.998 --> 09:29.232
Is she? Well, uh,
congratulations to both of you.

09:30.438 --> 09:32.550
Well, our reservation's
at 6:30.

09:32.646 --> 09:33.966
We better go, Jerry.

09:34.622 --> 09:36.230
It was nice
to see you again, Lorraine.

09:36.270 --> 09:37.260
You, too, Dana.

09:43.438 --> 09:46.502
The moot court will
consist of nine mock justices.

09:46.542 --> 09:48.086
Treat them as you would
the actual justices,

09:48.126 --> 09:50.766
which is to say
with the utmost respect.

09:51.454 --> 09:53.271
You may think you have
some idea of what it's like

09:53.311 --> 09:55.175
to argue
before the supreme court.

09:55.215 --> 09:56.601
Trust me. You do not.

09:57.151 --> 09:58.959
This will be the most difficult,

09:58.999 --> 10:01.070
the most high-pressure
courtroom experience

10:01.110 --> 10:02.562
you'll ever encounter.

10:04.670 --> 10:06.650
The justices are intimidating.

10:06.854 --> 10:10.055
They're often abrupt,
sometimes rude, all formidable.

10:10.095 --> 10:12.207
You make a single misstep,
you're likely to lose.

10:12.247 --> 10:14.879
You have the added pressure
of knowing that if you lose,

10:14.919 --> 10:16.041
your client dies.

10:16.903 --> 10:19.686
Okay, first off,
know that a criminal defendant

10:19.726 --> 10:22.295
has a better chance of getting
a presidential pardon

10:22.335 --> 10:24.335
than a reversal
from the supreme court.

10:24.375 --> 10:25.695
You need five votes.

10:25.823 --> 10:28.919
You're not gonna get Roberts,
Scalia, Thomas or Alito,

10:28.959 --> 10:29.983
so don't even bother.

10:30.023 --> 10:33.372
You should get Ginsburg, Breyer,
Souter and Stevens.

10:33.412 --> 10:36.712
Kennedy is the swing.
You need to focus on kennedy.

10:36.752 --> 10:39.944
Keep your argument focused
on constitutional issues.

10:39.984 --> 10:43.416
Do not —do not!— do not
be talking about your client.

10:43.456 --> 10:44.064
Well, if—

10:44.344 --> 10:45.424
He raped a child.

10:45.464 --> 10:49.886
If this turns on whether
they care about him, you lose.

11:03.973 --> 11:04.633
What's up?

11:04.773 --> 11:07.083
This needs to be
kept confidential.

11:08.597 --> 11:10.676
May I have your word
it shall be?

11:10.716 --> 11:11.188
Okay.

11:15.300 --> 11:16.554
Jerry's girlfriend…

11:17.708 --> 11:18.764
Dana Strickland…

11:19.141 --> 11:20.131
What about her?

11:20.269 --> 11:21.391
She works for me.

11:24.333 --> 11:25.925
I beg your pardon?

11:26.316 --> 11:29.020
I didn't entirely give up
the brothel business.

11:29.060 --> 11:30.512
Only my London office.

11:31.607 --> 11:32.993
You're still a madam?

11:33.541 --> 11:33.925
I am.

11:34.940 --> 11:37.935
And… Dana is
one of your girls?

11:39.413 --> 11:41.921
She is a rather
high-priced call girl.

11:46.565 --> 11:48.524
May it please the court,
my name is Alan Shore.

11:48.564 --> 11:50.524
Don't waste time
introducing yourself.

11:50.564 --> 11:53.431
They'll know who you are. –Fine. I'd
first like to direct the court's attention

11:53.471 --> 11:56.678
to the fact that my client has an IQ
of 70, which— –That's not on the table.

11:56.718 --> 11:58.390
Well, don't you think
you should put it on the table

11:58.430 --> 11:59.951
before killing Mr Serra?

11:59.991 --> 12:02.599
You speak with a tone like that,
you're done.

12:02.639 --> 12:05.007
The only issue here is,
is it constitutional

12:05.047 --> 12:07.039
to execute
for a nonhomicide rape?

12:07.079 --> 12:09.917
This court already held
in Coker vs Georgia

12:10.064 --> 12:11.678
that the death penalty
was not authorized

12:11.718 --> 12:14.750
in nonhomicide ra—
–That case did not speak to the rape of a child.

12:14.790 --> 12:16.111
And also,
the court looked to

12:16.151 --> 12:17.574
a national consensus
at the time,

12:17.614 --> 12:20.495
which was against capital
punishment in nonhomicide cases.

12:20.535 --> 12:22.711
Today the consensus is different.
–Wait a second.

12:22.751 --> 12:24.311
So it's to hell
with precedent.

12:24.351 --> 12:25.703
You're going to gauge
popular opinion.

12:25.743 --> 12:28.127
Okay. He's a disaster.

12:32.190 --> 12:32.718
My turn.

12:39.518 --> 12:42.783
So, Lenny, we argue
before the court tomorrow.

12:43.590 --> 12:46.063
They probably won't make
a decision right away.

12:46.103 --> 12:48.017
So we all have to be patient.

12:48.614 --> 12:50.990
What about, you know,
that I'm slow?

12:52.086 --> 12:53.142
Does that count?

12:53.175 --> 12:56.013
It does. They'll put you
in charge of FEMA.

12:58.416 --> 13:00.303
You'll tell them
I didn't do it, right?

13:00.343 --> 13:01.670
Lenny, for the purpose
of this appeal,

13:01.710 --> 13:03.558
they have to assume you did.

13:04.590 --> 13:06.768
I want you to tell them
I didn't.

13:07.790 --> 13:10.562
And I want you to ask them
not to kill me.

13:12.089 --> 13:14.003
I know some guys
want to die.

13:14.599 --> 13:15.350
I don't.

13:17.888 --> 13:19.871
I need you
to tell them that.

13:39.542 --> 13:40.268
Hey, Jerry.

13:41.206 --> 13:43.384
How did your dinner go
with Dana?

13:43.558 --> 13:44.878
Splendid, thank you.

13:45.031 --> 13:45.625
Splendid.

13:55.070 --> 13:56.126
What's going on?

13:56.662 --> 13:59.962
Jerry, you're aware I once
ran a brothel in London

14:00.502 --> 14:02.152
before coming to America.

14:02.351 --> 14:03.182
Yes. Why?

14:04.655 --> 14:05.975
I run one in Boston…

14:06.463 --> 14:07.321
and New York…

14:07.501 --> 14:09.547
and several other large cities.

14:10.444 --> 14:11.231
You do?

14:11.703 --> 14:13.183
It's mostly internet-based.

14:13.223 --> 14:14.455
I rarely meet my employees

14:14.495 --> 14:17.003
unless they're
extremely high earners.

14:18.646 --> 14:20.758
Why are you telling me
all this?

14:24.335 --> 14:25.479
I've met Dana…

14:27.727 --> 14:29.799
and it wasn't at a gym.

14:37.662 --> 14:40.782
Many of my employees
are in committed relationships,

14:40.822 --> 14:42.583
and I don't mean to indict
the legitimacy

14:42.623 --> 14:43.877
of yours with Dana.

14:44.535 --> 14:49.351
I tell you this simply because,
well, Katie and I both feel…

14:50.910 --> 14:53.352
you should know
if you don't already.

15:03.951 --> 15:05.733
Can you please go away now?

15:12.742 --> 15:14.062
For what it's worth,

15:14.293 --> 15:16.981
I know Dana to be an honest
and honorable person.

15:17.021 --> 15:18.927
If she tells you
she loves you,

15:18.967 --> 15:20.551
I suspect she loves you.

15:25.111 --> 15:26.959
Please go away. Both of you.

15:58.251 --> 15:59.260
Oh, my God.

15:59.804 --> 16:01.821
♫ How lucky can one guy be?

16:03.316 --> 16:05.428
♫ I kissed him,
and he kissed me

16:06.819 --> 16:08.535
♫ like the fella once said

16:08.923 --> 16:11.167
♫ “ain't that
a kick in the head?”

16:14.589 --> 16:16.635
♫ the room
was completely black

16:17.788 --> 16:20.032
♫ I hugged her,
she hugged me back

16:21.206 --> 16:23.120
♫ like the sailor said, quote

16:23.175 --> 16:25.781
♫ “ain't that a hole
in the boat?”

16:28.379 --> 16:30.491
♫ I've sunshine enough
to spread

16:31.556 --> 16:32.480
Cigar. Scotch.

16:33.299 --> 16:35.171
♫ And just like the fella said

16:35.211 --> 16:36.267
♫ “tell me quick

16:38.220 --> 16:39.606
♫ ain't love a kick”…

16:40.083 --> 16:41.227
Thank you.

16:41.771 --> 16:43.227
♫ “tell me quick

16:44.411 --> 16:45.665
♫ ain't love a kick

16:45.723 --> 16:47.211
in the head?”

16:57.012 --> 17:00.246
We coulda gone back to
their place for one drink.

17:00.611 --> 17:02.156
It's the night before
the supreme court,

17:02.196 --> 17:04.242
and I'm tired.
–It's always the night before something.

17:04.282 --> 17:05.507
Yes, well,
the something tomorrow

17:05.547 --> 17:06.675
is the highest court,

17:06.714 --> 17:09.323
and a man's life is at stake.
–You used to be fun.

17:09.363 --> 17:13.180
–Can you begin to appreciate the
gravity of tomorrow's— –Oh, please.

17:13.220 --> 17:15.915
–A man is facing death.
–Well, we all gotta die at one point.

17:15.955 --> 17:16.595
Shut up!

17:18.050 --> 17:19.851
You said you wanted
to be part of this case.

17:19.891 --> 17:22.155
Well, be part of it, damn it.
It's the supreme court.

17:22.194 --> 17:24.939
It's not enough for you
that we're out singing

17:24.979 --> 17:26.387
and drinking
with the go-go girls,

17:26.428 --> 17:28.738
but now you gotta go
back to their—

17:34.059 --> 17:34.587
Sorry.

17:43.180 --> 17:45.028
I don't mean
to snap at you.

17:53.460 --> 17:54.779
I'm nervous, Denny.

17:55.755 --> 17:57.507
I really didn't think
I would be,

17:57.547 --> 17:59.725
but I'm a little scared
to death.

18:02.132 --> 18:03.164
I'm sorry.

18:10.547 --> 18:11.801
I've been thinking.

18:15.139 --> 18:16.129
Ah, this kid's…

18:18.060 --> 18:19.211
best chance…

18:22.276 --> 18:24.256
You should do
all the arguing.

18:25.244 --> 18:25.970
It's enough

18:26.315 --> 18:27.701
that I'm in the room.

18:28.059 --> 18:29.841
My legacy will be complete.

18:31.460 --> 18:31.875
Denny—

18:32.196 --> 18:35.430
I— I'm not ready to go
toe-to-toe with Rehnquist.

18:35.811 --> 18:37.461
Denny, Rehnquist is dead.

18:39.508 --> 18:40.244
Even so…

18:41.427 --> 18:42.291
you argue.

18:42.795 --> 18:45.435
I'll flirt with Ginsburg
from the table.

18:45.683 --> 18:46.323
Right.

18:50.939 --> 18:51.699
You sure?

18:52.675 --> 18:53.243
I am.

18:55.652 --> 18:58.789
But you gotta do me
two favors though.

18:59.612 --> 19:02.252
First, I bet 50 grand
that we'd get, uh,

19:02.355 --> 19:04.005
Clarence Thomas to speak.

19:04.379 --> 19:05.987
The man hasn't spoken
a single word

19:06.027 --> 19:09.221
in 154 cases over 2 years.

19:09.604 --> 19:11.584
Well, just mention
Anita Hill…

19:12.363 --> 19:13.555
The porn collection.

19:13.595 --> 19:14.450
Bait him a little.

19:14.490 --> 19:17.328
I'm not gonna bait
a supreme court justice.

19:18.964 --> 19:20.482
What's the other favor?

19:22.099 --> 19:23.243
Kick ass.

19:23.996 --> 19:26.084
It's our time
in the great hall

19:26.572 --> 19:29.542
in front of the highest court
in the country…

19:29.668 --> 19:30.724
maybe the world.

19:31.804 --> 19:32.728
Be respectful…

19:37.219 --> 19:38.372
but kick ass.

19:40.867 --> 19:43.177
Be Alan Shore
for all you're worth.

19:45.428 --> 19:48.266
And you know how
they start these sessions?

19:48.636 --> 19:51.308
This, uh, clerk,
this really pretty woman,

19:51.348 --> 19:54.675
she says, “oh, yes,
oh, yes, oh, yes!”

19:55.323 --> 19:57.484
it's like sex, Alan.

19:59.339 --> 20:01.476
It's not “oh, yes.”
It's “oyez.”

20:03.595 --> 20:04.060
What?

20:04.907 --> 20:05.524
Oyez.

20:09.651 --> 20:12.211
<i>Oyez,</i> oyez, oyez.

20:13.100 --> 20:15.628
All persons having business
before the honorable,

20:15.668 --> 20:17.652
the supreme court
of the United States,

20:17.692 --> 20:20.036
are admonished to draw near
and give their attention,

20:20.076 --> 20:21.990
for the court is now sitting.

20:22.196 --> 20:25.628
God save the United States
and this honorable court.

20:29.798 --> 20:31.910
I had no idea
they sat so close.

20:34.550 --> 20:36.740
We're here, Alan.
We're really here.

20:36.780 --> 20:40.703
Look at us— in the supreme court
of the United States.

20:44.989 --> 20:47.695
I love you, man.
–I love you, too, Denny.

20:54.308 --> 20:56.045
This morning,
we will hear arguments

20:56.085 --> 20:58.395
in Serra vs the state
of Louisiana.

20:58.741 --> 20:59.467
Mr Lazarus.

21:02.021 --> 21:03.069
Mr Chief justice.

21:03.109 --> 21:04.909
How do you distinguish
this case from Coker,

21:04.949 --> 21:06.420
where we barred
the death penalty

21:06.460 --> 21:09.206
for nonhomicide rape?
–Well, first, Mr Chief justice,

21:09.246 --> 21:11.910
Coker was linked to the rape
of adult women.

21:11.950 --> 21:13.624
–Dull. Where's the remote?
–Shh.

21:13.664 --> 21:16.983
And second, that ruling relied
on the evidence of a national trend

21:17.023 --> 21:19.663
against execution
for nonhomicide cases.

21:19.839 --> 21:23.337
Today, five states make
child rape a capital offense.

21:24.126 --> 21:27.399
We also have the death penalty
for air piracy and treason,

21:27.439 --> 21:29.221
also non homicide offenses.

21:30.118 --> 21:31.570
When a child is raped,

21:32.111 --> 21:35.519
the impact is beyond
horrible, beyond repair.

21:36.615 --> 21:39.585
And the fact that
the raped child doesn't die

21:39.663 --> 21:41.841
doesn't make it
any less heinous,

21:41.926 --> 21:45.446
any less unconscionable,
any less unspeakable,

22:06.823 --> 22:08.959
Hey, Jerry.
Ready for lunch?

22:14.239 --> 22:15.097
What's wrong?

22:22.383 --> 22:25.367
Lorraine informs me
you work as an escort

22:25.719 --> 22:26.709
at her service.

22:29.166 --> 22:30.420
Is that true, Dana?

22:34.614 --> 22:35.868
Is that true, Dana?

22:39.614 --> 22:40.206
Yes.

22:48.655 --> 22:49.513
Please leave.

22:51.871 --> 22:54.335
Could I have
an opportunity to explain?

22:54.375 --> 22:55.942
I don't think there's
an explanation you could offer

22:55.982 --> 22:57.502
I would find satisfactory.

22:57.542 --> 22:58.870
Dana, please leave.

22:59.326 --> 22:59.751
Jerry…

23:03.135 --> 23:05.049
I kept part of my life
a lie.

23:09.055 --> 23:11.310
When I tell you
I love you…

23:15.047 --> 23:17.127
that, isn't a lie.

23:21.015 --> 23:22.863
What we had
the other night…

23:24.993 --> 23:26.313
that, was not a lie.

23:54.636 --> 23:57.210
The punishment
is not disproportionate.

23:57.540 --> 24:00.378
It reflects the current
national consensus.

24:00.820 --> 24:02.669
This court
has been criticized recently

24:02.709 --> 24:05.283
for not standing up
for the little guy.

24:05.397 --> 24:07.597
Well, I'm standing here today
asking you

24:07.637 --> 24:10.085
to stick up
for an 8-year-old girl

24:10.781 --> 24:13.213
who was raped
by the defendant.

24:14.364 --> 24:15.588
Okay, Mr Lazarus.

24:15.924 --> 24:17.780
The red light indicates
your time is up.

24:17.820 --> 24:19.668
Thank you,
Mr Chief justice.

24:21.421 --> 24:22.147
This is it.

24:23.765 --> 24:25.645
I think
I'd rather be fishing.

24:25.685 --> 24:26.411
Go get 'em.

24:34.129 --> 24:36.600
May it please the court,
Mr Chief justice,

24:36.640 --> 24:41.873
currently there are 3,300 people
on death row in this country.

24:42.209 --> 24:45.480
My client is one of only two
who did not commit murder.

24:45.520 --> 24:47.432
You here to give us
a box score?

24:47.472 --> 24:50.244
I'd like to provide
a context, your honor.

24:50.257 --> 24:51.115
In Louisiana,

24:51.257 --> 24:55.097
180 men have been prosecuted
for child rape

24:55.489 --> 24:58.129
since this law
went into effect in 1995.

24:58.224 --> 25:01.062
Leonard Serra is the only one
facing death.

25:01.297 --> 25:04.760
Look, counsel, Louisiana law
permits death for child rape.

25:04.800 --> 25:07.681
And I would respectfully submit
that law is unconstitutional.

25:07.721 --> 25:08.645
Based on what?

25:08.961 --> 25:12.249
Based on this court's finding in
Coker that the death penalty—

25:12.289 --> 25:14.006
Which spoke to the rape
of an adult, not a child.

25:14.046 --> 25:16.158
Maybe you need
to read it again.

25:17.214 --> 25:19.365
And even if I were
to concede your point,

25:19.405 --> 25:20.329
which I don't,

25:20.509 --> 25:23.261
there's a national consensus now
in favor of authorizing

25:23.301 --> 25:25.204
the death penalty
for nonhomicide rape.

25:25.244 --> 25:27.412
Why, because Louisiana passed
a barbaric law?

25:27.452 --> 25:30.084
Joining the ranks of
Saudi Arabia, Uganda, China—

25:30.124 --> 25:33.148
–And other states in this
country who— –Five. Five states.

25:33.188 --> 25:34.757
That's hardly a consensus.

25:34.797 --> 25:36.957
And none of those other states
authorize death

25:36.997 --> 25:39.157
for first-time offenders
as Louisiana does.

25:39.197 --> 25:40.924
And it should also be noted,

25:40.964 --> 25:43.620
in your reliance
on a “national consensus,”

25:43.660 --> 25:45.692
you look to trends
in legislation,

25:45.732 --> 25:48.525
laws passed by politicians,
mostly around election time,

25:48.565 --> 25:51.133
when they're desperate
to appear tough on crime.

25:51.173 --> 25:54.725
The people who care the most
about the welfare of children,

25:54.765 --> 25:56.811
uh, doctors and social workers,

25:56.845 --> 25:58.997
the people who actually treat
abused kids,

25:59.037 --> 26:00.621
have filed amicus briefs

26:00.740 --> 26:02.380
asking you
to strike down this law

26:02.420 --> 26:04.092
because they know
the death penalty, in fact,

26:04.132 --> 26:06.589
does not protect kids at all,
but rather

26:06.629 --> 26:08.340
it makes it less likely
the children,

26:08.380 --> 26:10.685
even if they've been abused,
will report the crime,

26:10.725 --> 26:13.108
especially if a family member
is involved.

26:13.148 --> 26:16.429
No kid wants to be responsible
for a relative being executed.

26:16.469 --> 26:18.581
And children often get it wrong.

26:18.748 --> 26:21.796
They are uniquely prone
to suggestibility and coercion,

26:21.836 --> 26:24.348
not that the police would ever
be guilty of that, of course.

26:24.388 --> 26:27.709
But we already have an epidemic
of wrongful convictions

26:27.749 --> 26:28.805
in this country—

26:28.869 --> 26:30.519
as many as 15,000 a year,

26:30.861 --> 26:32.941
too many of them
ending up on death row—

26:32.981 --> 26:36.292
and child rape prosecutions
are especially unreliable.

26:36.332 --> 26:38.524
And now we want to add,
uh, the death penalty

26:38.564 --> 26:40.589
to make
these mistakes irrevocable?

26:40.629 --> 26:43.929
Whatever one's feelings are
on capital punishment—

26:44.004 --> 26:47.221
and I realize with this court,
one seems to be for it—

26:47.261 --> 26:48.900
you simply cannot ignore
the fact

26:48.940 --> 26:50.492
that we often screw it up.

26:50.532 --> 26:52.725
We convict the innocent,
we botch executions,

26:52.765 --> 26:54.285
which is why many states

26:54.325 --> 26:56.629
have declared a moratorium
on capital punishment.

26:56.669 --> 26:58.374
That's your true
national consensus.

26:58.414 --> 26:59.887
And yet, here comes Louisiana,

26:59.927 --> 27:02.237
seeking to expand
the death penalty

27:02.263 --> 27:03.649
to nonhomicide cases—

27:03.791 --> 27:06.247
and this is my favorite part—
to kill the mentally disabled.

27:06.287 --> 27:09.575
Are we serious? –This defendant was
never officially pronounced disabled.

27:09.615 --> 27:11.286
But he is just the same,
your honor.

27:11.326 --> 27:13.883
He has an IQ of 70.
They're gonna kill him

27:13.923 --> 27:15.299
because there was
no official pronouncement?

27:15.339 --> 27:18.659
The way this goes, counsel,
is we work off a record,

27:18.699 --> 27:22.386
which you are not free to amend.
–But by record, you simply mean the conviction.

27:22.426 --> 27:25.555
A reading of the entire record
shows that he denies his guilt

27:25.595 --> 27:27.514
and always has,
he has no prior arrests,

27:27.554 --> 27:29.707
that the victim never even
made the accusation

27:29.747 --> 27:32.849
until a full 20 months
after the alleged crime.

27:33.139 --> 27:34.307
There was no DNA—

27:34.603 --> 27:37.394
Factual innocence is not
something you get to argue.

27:37.434 --> 27:39.018
Well, how silly is that?

27:39.395 --> 27:41.435
You're deciding whether or not
to kill someone,

27:41.475 --> 27:44.034
and his possible innocence
is irrelevant?

27:44.074 --> 27:47.051
Mr Shore, I don't like
your demeanor, your tone,

27:47.091 --> 27:49.731
and I would remind you
of where you are.

27:49.923 --> 27:52.427
I know exactly where I am,
Mr Chief justice.

27:52.467 --> 27:54.523
I'm in the supreme court
of the United States,

27:54.563 --> 27:57.852
and let me tell you, you folks aren't
as hot as all get out. –Dear God.

27:57.892 --> 27:59.787
Let's consider your respective
senate confirmations.

27:59.827 --> 28:01.626
You all testified under oath

28:01.666 --> 28:03.499
that you never
actually considered

28:03.539 --> 28:05.076
how you would rule on abortion.

28:05.116 --> 28:06.628
You must be kidding me.
Never gave it a thought?

28:06.668 --> 28:09.165
No perjury there?
Justice Scalia…

28:09.581 --> 28:12.029
you went duck hunting
with vice president Cheney

28:12.069 --> 28:14.293
while he was a named defendant
in a case before this court.

28:14.333 --> 28:16.596
Congratulations on not getting
shot, by the way, but you didn't

28:16.636 --> 28:19.028
exactly avoid the appearance
of impropriety there.

28:19.068 --> 28:22.417
Justice Alito, you were caught
hearing a case involving

28:22.457 --> 28:24.257
a company you'd invested
hundreds of thousands

28:24.297 --> 28:26.802
of dollars in. Huh.
No conflict of interest there?

28:26.842 --> 28:28.824
You also don't recuse yourself
in terrorism cases

28:28.864 --> 28:31.080
even though your best friend
is Michael Chertoff,

28:31.120 --> 28:32.760
head of homeland security.

28:32.800 --> 28:34.704
Seems to me the supreme court
of the United States

28:34.744 --> 28:36.272
should be made of sterner stuff.
Am I right?

28:36.312 --> 28:39.649
Justice Thomas, at least
put down the magazine. –Hey.

28:39.689 --> 28:42.721
I really don't think you mean
to come after us, counsel.

28:42.761 --> 28:45.808
Oh, but I do. In your short term
as Chief justice,

28:45.848 --> 28:47.520
this court,
with your narrow majority,

28:47.560 --> 28:49.376
has turned back the clock
on civil rights,

28:49.416 --> 28:52.321
school segregation,
equal protection, free speech,

28:52.361 --> 28:54.088
abortion, campaign finance.

28:54.128 --> 28:56.945
You've been overtly
and shamelessly pro-business,

28:56.985 --> 28:58.737
making it impossible
for some plaintiffs

28:58.777 --> 29:00.201
to so much as sue corporations,

29:00.241 --> 29:01.913
especially big oil
and big tobacco.

29:01.953 --> 29:03.609
Somebody's gotta go after you.

29:03.649 --> 29:06.490
Exxonmobil made over $40 billion
in 2007—

29:06.881 --> 29:08.666
$40 billion—

29:09.057 --> 29:11.792
And yet 19 years
after the “valdez” oil spill,

29:11.832 --> 29:14.153
plaintiffs are still waiting
to be fully compensated.

29:14.193 --> 29:17.148
Justice Scalia, you want to
overturn the verdict all together

29:17.188 --> 29:18.596
because it's not
the company's fault

29:18.636 --> 29:19.797
that the ship's captain
got drunk?

29:19.837 --> 29:21.349
But he was a drunk
and they knew it.

29:21.389 --> 29:22.605
Perhaps not the best choice

29:22.645 --> 29:24.885
to pilot 53 million gallons
of crude oil

29:24.925 --> 29:28.469
through an environmentally sensitive area.
–You are getting so far off point.

29:28.509 --> 29:30.348
My point is,
who are you people?

29:30.388 --> 29:32.204
You've transformed this court
from being

29:32.244 --> 29:35.461
a governmental branch <i>devoted</i>
to civil rights and liberties

29:35.501 --> 29:37.221
into a protector
of discrimination,

29:37.261 --> 29:38.365
a guardian of government,

29:38.405 --> 29:41.030
a slave to moneyed interests
and big business,

29:41.070 --> 29:42.871
and today— hallelujah—
you seek to kill

29:42.911 --> 29:44.086
a mentally disabled man.

29:44.126 --> 29:45.983
I'm curious. As a group,
how many executions

29:46.023 --> 29:48.135
have you all actually witnessed?

29:49.535 --> 29:50.723
I'm sorry. That's…

29:53.743 --> 29:54.667
that's unfair.

30:00.558 --> 30:01.548
I've seen five.

30:03.175 --> 30:05.151
And it is the most inhumane…

30:06.455 --> 30:08.801
cruel, and unusual hypocrisy

30:09.558 --> 30:11.902
of a system
that promises to be just.

30:11.942 --> 30:13.630
I'll ask you to leave
your personal politics

30:13.670 --> 30:16.151
out of this, counsel.
–And I'd ask you to do exactly the same.

30:16.191 --> 30:18.171
The supreme court
was intended

30:18.287 --> 30:20.663
to be free
and unadulterated by politics.

30:20.703 --> 30:22.419
It is now dominated by it.

30:22.471 --> 30:25.352
You're handpicked by presidents
with ideological agendas,

30:25.392 --> 30:27.713
and of the 2 dozen
5-4 decisions

30:28.152 --> 30:29.850
in your 2006-2007 term,

30:30.201 --> 30:32.673
19 broke straight across
ideological lines.

30:32.713 --> 30:33.769
That's politics.

30:34.041 --> 30:37.128
And while you claim to be
against judicial activism,

30:37.168 --> 30:39.793
you rewrote —uh, check that—
invented new law

30:39.833 --> 30:41.801
to decide a presidential
election, for god's sake.

30:41.841 --> 30:44.137
If that's the way it's gonna be,
then at least have the decency

30:44.177 --> 30:46.209
to put your names on ballots
like the rest of the politicians

30:46.249 --> 30:47.952
so that we, the people,
get a voice.

30:47.992 --> 30:50.965
Mr Shore,
you have said quite enough.

30:51.493 --> 30:52.981
Now you might consider

30:53.349 --> 30:55.397
using what little time
you have remaining

30:55.437 --> 30:57.021
to represent your client

30:57.077 --> 30:59.915
instead of your own left-wing agenda.
–Yes.

31:06.581 --> 31:10.574
I absolutely cannot…
stand up here

31:10.893 --> 31:13.929
and ask anybody to excuse
the rape of a child.

31:13.941 --> 31:16.829
If it were my child, I'd want
to shoot the son of a bitch

31:16.869 --> 31:18.548
in front of the courthouse.

31:18.588 --> 31:20.502
But the more evolved response

31:20.564 --> 31:23.116
would be to take into account
all the circumstances

31:23.156 --> 31:26.669
and to deliberate and decide
whether Leonard Serra

31:27.109 --> 31:30.501
truly represents the worst
of the worst of humanity,

31:30.541 --> 31:33.049
for whom we reserve
the death penalty.

31:35.764 --> 31:39.709
I've been… advised
by my advisors

31:40.100 --> 31:41.389
not to talk about Leonard,

31:41.429 --> 31:42.556
but I am going to talk about him

31:42.596 --> 31:45.405
because Leonard Serra
is not in any way the worst.

31:45.445 --> 31:47.405
Leonard is not a son of a bitch.

31:47.445 --> 31:50.283
Emotionally, intellectually,
he is a child.

31:51.446 --> 31:53.789
Is this <i>really</i> the person
to make an example of?

31:53.829 --> 31:55.413
Of all the men Louisiana

31:55.669 --> 31:58.429
has prosecuted for child rape
since the passage of this law,

31:58.469 --> 32:00.901
only Leonard has been
sentenced to death.

32:00.941 --> 32:02.229
Does it strike
any of you as fair

32:02.269 --> 32:04.597
that the one guy singled out
is the one with an IQ of 70?

32:04.637 --> 32:05.300
Really?

32:10.989 --> 32:12.507
Leonard Serra is black.

32:13.757 --> 32:16.053
In Louisiana, historically,
it's been blacks

32:16.093 --> 32:19.460
that have been executed for rape
in nonhomicide cases.

32:19.500 --> 32:20.588
In the last hundred years,

32:20.628 --> 32:23.202
Louisiana has executed
29 men for rape.

32:23.340 --> 32:24.330
All were black.

32:25.949 --> 32:27.181
On the face of this building,

32:27.221 --> 32:29.333
it reads,
“equal justice under law.”

32:29.373 --> 32:31.353
I would beg you to honor that.

32:34.382 --> 32:36.230
And finally I'd like to say,

32:36.449 --> 32:37.577
despite my tone…

32:39.786 --> 32:41.025
I have always been

32:41.481 --> 32:42.537
and still am in…

32:45.184 --> 32:47.792
enormous awe
of this institution.

32:49.953 --> 32:53.633
Elected officials represent
the will of the American people.

32:53.673 --> 32:56.625
But the supreme court
has always reflected our soul

32:56.665 --> 32:58.793
and our… conscience.

33:00.512 --> 33:02.761
My conscience,
and I hope yours,

33:03.168 --> 33:04.686
simply cannot reconcile

33:04.953 --> 33:07.097
executing
a mentally disabled man,

33:07.137 --> 33:09.265
whether he was officially
pronounced as such or not.

33:09.305 --> 33:11.351
We have to be
better than that…

33:12.193 --> 33:14.329
even if Louisiana isn't.

33:17.785 --> 33:21.288
You know, on the…
back of this building

33:21.624 --> 33:23.674
is that magnificent sculpture,

33:24.659 --> 33:28.915
part of which symbolizes
the concept of…

33:29.684 --> 33:31.914
justice tempered by mercy.

33:32.962 --> 33:35.602
If mercy truly lives
within these walls,

33:36.122 --> 33:38.972
within your hearts
as justices, as people,

33:39.627 --> 33:43.257
you cannot cause this man
to be injected with chemicals

33:43.451 --> 33:45.431
for the purpose of killing him

33:45.435 --> 33:48.498
for a crime it's very possible
he did not commit.

33:48.538 --> 33:50.452
He asked me to tell you that,

33:50.899 --> 33:53.436
that he… did not commit it.

33:54.394 --> 33:57.659
He felt it was important
that you… know that.

34:03.299 --> 34:05.213
He also asked me to tell you…

34:07.251 --> 34:08.786
he doesn't want to die.

34:52.181 --> 34:53.650
Well, how long
before they rule?

34:53.690 --> 34:54.882
Do we have any idea?

34:54.922 --> 34:56.402
Could be weeks,
even months.

34:56.442 --> 34:58.331
–Do I have any chance?
–Well, if—

34:58.371 --> 35:01.187
–I mean with you.
–Let's just say Lenny Serra's chances

35:01.227 --> 35:03.537
would be better than yours.
–Tease.

35:04.051 --> 35:05.875
Well,
this is good-bye, then.

35:05.915 --> 35:07.291
Yes. Thank you.

35:09.683 --> 35:11.842
Listen, I'm not a very
sentimental person, but—

35:11.882 --> 35:14.058
Hey, if you're gonna say
anything mushy, direct it at me.

35:14.098 --> 35:15.550
I'll direct it at him.

35:17.699 --> 35:19.715
My father tried
to discourage me

35:19.755 --> 35:21.107
from the practice of law,

35:21.147 --> 35:24.711
suggesting that the profession
was anything but noble.

35:26.227 --> 35:27.745
Listening to you today…

35:32.946 --> 35:34.570
Well, good-bye, Alan,

35:35.770 --> 35:36.694
and thank you.

35:41.579 --> 35:42.611
Carl.

35:43.027 --> 35:43.489
Audrey.

35:57.169 --> 35:59.145
Just to clarify,
since you did all the arguing,

35:59.185 --> 36:02.281
should we lose, this does not
count on my record.

36:02.321 --> 36:03.289
Of course not, Denny.

36:03.329 --> 36:06.481
I don't plan to end up 18-1,
if you get my drift.

36:06.521 --> 36:06.984
Alan…

36:09.096 --> 36:10.086
Uh, one second?

36:12.817 --> 36:14.216
For the record,

36:14.672 --> 36:16.480
though some lawyers
would've found

36:16.520 --> 36:18.609
your little performance
heroic today,

36:18.649 --> 36:21.355
and say, “wow,
you really are something,”

36:21.361 --> 36:24.177
be aware, it's not the policy
of Crane, Poole & Schmidt

36:24.217 --> 36:26.537
to attack, dismiss, disrespect

36:26.963 --> 36:28.960
the supreme court
of the United States.

36:29.000 --> 36:30.496
And should you ever
have opportunity

36:30.536 --> 36:32.252
to revisit the great hall,

36:32.649 --> 36:34.921
you will conduct yourself
in a manner more commensurate

36:34.961 --> 36:36.745
with the values
and policies of this firm.

36:36.785 --> 36:40.019
Notwithstanding, there are
those who might think…

36:40.609 --> 36:43.150
you really are something.

36:47.565 --> 36:48.373
Got it?

36:51.061 --> 36:51.824
Got it.

37:03.581 --> 37:04.307
Hey, Jerry.

37:04.757 --> 37:05.172
Hey.

37:07.229 --> 37:08.269
You talked to Dana?

37:08.309 --> 37:08.797
I did.

37:09.357 --> 37:11.326
We're done, finis,
terminare…

37:11.916 --> 37:12.510
kaputski.

37:13.621 --> 37:14.917
I'm sorry to hear that.

37:14.957 --> 37:17.189
Even though I'm sure
it has to…

37:18.429 --> 37:19.476
What is that?

37:20.909 --> 37:23.021
That's Patty.
We've reconnected.

37:24.237 --> 37:26.283
You've reconnected
with a doll?

37:26.685 --> 37:27.373
Yes.

37:28.652 --> 37:29.048
Jerry…

37:31.476 --> 37:35.181
Having a relationship with…
an inanimate friend

37:36.069 --> 37:38.653
suggests a certain willingness
on your part

37:38.693 --> 37:41.191
to forsake
conventional expectations.

37:41.873 --> 37:43.455
Might such an open-mindedness

37:43.495 --> 37:45.623
occasion you to consider
a relationship with Dana,

37:45.663 --> 37:47.303
if you two really love
each other?

37:47.343 --> 37:49.990
Go out with a call girl?
Do I look that desperate?

37:50.030 --> 37:52.894
You don't seem at all desperate
enough to date a doll.

37:52.934 --> 37:55.767
Look, I'm not saying it wasn't
right to end things with Dana,

37:55.807 --> 38:00.200
but I am saying…
Love is difficult to find.

38:02.024 --> 38:04.823
It's very difficult.

38:07.206 --> 38:09.102
Perhaps you might take
a day or two

38:09.142 --> 38:10.918
before declaring it finis,
terminare,

38:10.958 --> 38:12.542
and especially kaputski.

38:13.135 --> 38:15.543
There's a certain finality
to ending things in polish.

38:15.583 --> 38:18.025
I'm not gonna date
a call girl, okay?

38:21.223 --> 38:21.790
Okay.

38:23.982 --> 38:26.847
Well… good night, then.

38:27.191 --> 38:27.917
Good night.

38:47.294 --> 38:50.330
I thought Scalia would
rupture a blood vessel.

38:50.823 --> 38:51.985
And did you see Alito?

38:52.025 --> 38:53.741
He hasn't been so offended

38:53.992 --> 38:55.728
since they let blacks
and girls into Princeton.

38:55.768 --> 38:57.953
I didn't really mean
to go on the attack.

38:57.993 --> 38:58.504
I just…

39:00.346 --> 39:02.062
Did I at least make sense?

39:03.730 --> 39:04.713
Not to me.

39:06.881 --> 39:09.323
But I'll tell you this,
I admire you.

39:09.514 --> 39:12.427
To march
into the supreme court

39:12.944 --> 39:15.980
and fight for a principle
you believe in— wow.

39:16.488 --> 39:18.449
How many people
have such a chance

39:18.489 --> 39:20.073
and actually seize it?

39:25.553 --> 39:26.761
You made me proud.

39:30.353 --> 39:31.600
My favorite part…

39:32.080 --> 39:34.786
was when you got
Clarence Thomas to talk.

39:38.009 --> 39:39.505
We got to see
the White House.

39:39.545 --> 39:42.053
Up close, as close
as Ginsburg's mole.

39:43.426 --> 39:45.670
Did you see her
making eyes at me?

39:46.272 --> 39:47.790
Oh, she was hot for me.

39:47.833 --> 39:48.955
What woman isn't?

39:50.241 --> 39:51.165
It's my curse.

39:52.649 --> 39:55.553
You know, I was thinking
about what you said

39:56.209 --> 39:57.001
about mercy.

39:59.361 --> 40:03.057
I sometimes wonder whether
that'll be part of my legacy.

40:04.056 --> 40:07.528
I mean, will someone stand up
at my funeral and say,

40:07.953 --> 40:10.197
“that man had mercy
in his heart”?

40:10.825 --> 40:11.297
I will.

40:19.226 --> 40:21.161
I hope they don't
kill that kid.

40:21.201 --> 40:22.983
I'm for capital punishment…

40:26.217 --> 40:28.263
but I hope
they don't kill him.

40:30.329 --> 40:31.057
Yeah.

40:36.432 --> 40:39.384
I read… somewhere…

40:40.824 --> 40:43.185
“make time to travel
with a loved one

40:43.225 --> 40:44.545
to a special place.”

40:45.305 --> 40:47.914
You and I…
first Nimmo bay…

40:49.049 --> 40:50.765
and now the supreme court.

40:53.209 --> 40:54.133
Where to next?

40:56.376 --> 40:57.960
I'll think of someplace.

41:01.473 --> 41:03.321
'Cause we're not done, Alan.

41:04.977 --> 41:06.073
No, we're not.

41:13.025 --> 41:14.015
Not even close.

41:17.169 --> 41:18.976
Maybe we could go
to Wednesdays.

41:19.016 --> 41:19.676
Next week?

41:20.762 --> 41:21.353
Why not?

41:23.386 --> 41:25.989
Wednesdays…
I like it.

41:30.334 --> 41:33.766
