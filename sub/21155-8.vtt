WEBVTT

00:01.002 --> 00:02.708
- Previously on "Killjoys"...

00:02.920 --> 00:05.707
-All girls are
filled with magic.

00:05.923 --> 00:07.003
I did it, Papa.

00:07.216 --> 00:08.422
She's the me I should have been.

00:09.010 --> 00:11.171
She's your good wolf.

00:11.179 --> 00:14.137
- Jelco, l have a very special
package with your name on it.

00:14.140 --> 00:15.721
- I've got something
for you instead.

00:15.725 --> 00:17.181
- No!

00:17.185 --> 00:18.516
- You're not yourself
these days.

00:18.686 --> 00:20.802
- You're right.
I can't be a leader right now.

00:20.813 --> 00:22.553
I don't want to be.

00:22.565 --> 00:24.601
It's your army.
Take good care of it.

00:24.609 --> 00:27.476
- Any captive can wrestle
Big Borna for their freedom.

00:27.487 --> 00:29.773
- Aneela's abilities with the
green are unlike anyone else's.

00:29.780 --> 00:32.442
But thanks to a recent
scientific breakthrough,

00:32.450 --> 00:33.815
we may not need her anymore.

00:33.826 --> 00:36.283
And that's where you come in.

00:36.287 --> 00:37.493
Take her to treatment.

01:02.480 --> 01:04.766
- So that's obviously
not the best case scenario.

01:04.774 --> 01:06.514
- Yeah, that's
the only case scenario.

01:06.526 --> 01:08.062
I've run every
possible variable,

01:08.069 --> 01:09.400
and they all end like this.

01:09.403 --> 01:10.779
- Explody?
Bullshit.

01:10.780 --> 01:12.111
— Well, technically,
this is an implosion.

01:12.114 --> 01:13.854
- Well then,
what are we missing?

01:13.866 --> 01:15.822
We've 34 Black Root ships
we can pilot and sink now,

01:15.826 --> 01:17.657
1,200 Ferran mercenaries,
Qreshi money,

01:17.662 --> 01:19.698
and an assload of angry Killjoys
out for revenge.

01:19.705 --> 01:22.788
-And the Hullen have biology,
Aneela, and a sweet-ass armada.

01:22.792 --> 01:24.748
- Since when do you let
biology make you her bitch?

01:24.752 --> 01:28.620
- Since
127 probable outcomes agree.

01:28.631 --> 01:30.747
Look, the Cleansed
that Fancy recruited

01:30.758 --> 01:32.669
helped me build this model.

01:32.677 --> 01:34.542
Some of them have actually seen
what we're up against, D'av.

01:34.554 --> 01:36.670
Head-to-head, we are toast.

01:36.681 --> 01:39.593
- How am I supposed to present
this to the war council tonight?

01:39.600 --> 01:41.886
"Welcome, I'll be
your general this evening.

01:41.894 --> 01:44.681
Congratulations, you've all
signed up for certain death."

01:44.689 --> 01:46.099
- I guess you should have
thought of that before

01:46.107 --> 01:48.143
giving yourself
a promotion, jefe.

01:48.150 --> 01:50.562
- Don't give me shit, Johnny.
- Oh, I'm giving you shit.

01:50.570 --> 01:52.731
See this?
This is my shit face.

01:52.738 --> 01:55.150
You took Dutch's army.
- She abandoned her army.

01:55.157 --> 01:56.693
I gave her a push
to wake her up.

01:56.701 --> 01:58.362
Since when doesn't
she push back?

02:01.122 --> 02:02.612
That trip down
Aneela memory lane

02:02.623 --> 02:04.955
jacked her up,
and she won't tell me why.

02:04.959 --> 02:07.951
She's acting weird.
She's hiding something.

02:07.962 --> 02:10.829
I'm worried about her, D'av.

02:10.840 --> 02:13.456
-Soam l.

02:13.467 --> 02:16.459
But we've got a war ringing
our doorbell any minute, John.

02:16.470 --> 02:18.927
We need a leader,
and whether we like it or not,

02:18.931 --> 02:20.387
it's not gonna be Dutch.

02:20.391 --> 02:22.882
- I don't like it.

02:22.893 --> 02:24.554
But if I have to
follow anyone else

02:24.562 --> 02:28.726
into shitty odds
and a fiery death,

02:28.733 --> 02:30.689
I don't hate that it's you.

02:32.570 --> 02:34.731
- Thank you.

02:34.739 --> 02:37.355
You say we can't win this
head-to-head.

02:38.826 --> 02:41.568
We gotta get dirtier.
- Ass-to-mouth?

02:41.579 --> 02:42.659
- I'm saying if we're
gonna win this war,

02:42.663 --> 02:44.528
we gotta cheat,

02:44.540 --> 02:45.871
Killjoy style.

02:49.754 --> 02:52.416
- J‘ Ooh, ooh

02:52.423 --> 02:53.583
J“ Ooh, ooh

02:54.800 --> 02:57.633
J‘ Ooh, ooh,
ooh, ooh J‘

02:58.679 --> 03:00.510
J“ Ooh, ooh

03:10.608 --> 03:14.897
- Whoa.
- Freaky, huh?

03:14.904 --> 03:17.941
- I can't believe
you didn't tell me.

03:17.948 --> 03:20.781
We had a sweet-ass
piece of Hullen biotech

03:20.785 --> 03:22.525
just sitting here all lonesome?

03:22.536 --> 03:24.447
- Sabine led us to it.

03:24.455 --> 03:25.820
I wanted it destroyed.

03:25.831 --> 03:27.947
- Which would have been
senseless destruction

03:27.958 --> 03:29.869
of an innocent,
beautiful device.

03:29.877 --> 03:31.913
Shh, now, it's okay.

03:31.921 --> 03:33.582
You're safe.

03:35.800 --> 03:37.461
Ow.

03:37.468 --> 03:38.958
What's inside?

03:38.969 --> 03:40.755
- This one Khlyen made me
was a safe house,

03:40.763 --> 03:42.924
but the first one he made
was a prison for Aneela.

03:42.932 --> 03:44.797
I saw it in her memories.

03:44.809 --> 03:46.891
- This baby only opens
for Dutch, nobody else.

03:46.894 --> 03:48.976
- So one keeps Aneela out;
The other locks her in.

03:48.979 --> 03:50.685
- If we can figure out
how it tells the difference

03:50.690 --> 03:52.226
between them,
maybe we can use it.

03:52.233 --> 03:53.598
- You learn anything
about Aneela and the Remnant

03:53.609 --> 03:54.849
that might be useful?

03:54.860 --> 03:56.976
Something so I know
what to look for?

03:56.987 --> 03:58.818
- Just that she can
go into the green

03:58.823 --> 04:01.485
and do things with memories
that no one else can.

04:03.869 --> 04:05.985
- D'av's ready for
another round of war games.

04:05.996 --> 04:07.281
You in?

04:07.289 --> 04:09.245
- Later.
l'll catch up.

04:10.835 --> 04:11.950
- You sure?

04:11.961 --> 04:13.041
- Mm-hmm.

04:14.755 --> 04:17.713
- Okay, but
I'm eating all the good snacks.

04:17.717 --> 04:19.503
You don't have to stay.

04:19.510 --> 04:20.841
This may take me a while.

04:20.845 --> 04:23.587
- I know, but...

04:23.597 --> 04:25.679
forget science and the cube.

04:25.683 --> 04:27.924
There's something more important
I need you to do.

04:27.935 --> 04:30.642
- Please don't say arm wrestle.

04:35.901 --> 04:38.017
- They're all useless shells.

04:38.028 --> 04:40.314
- Maybe if we knew
which of them helped Gander

04:40.322 --> 04:43.314
put the Qreshi woman...
- Her name is Kendry.

04:45.661 --> 04:49.620
Why are you helping me, Brynn?

04:49.623 --> 04:52.114
You aren't slave Hullen.

04:52.126 --> 04:54.708
You have a choice.

04:54.712 --> 04:57.545
You're free, like Gander.

04:57.548 --> 04:59.960
- I fear you
more than I fear him.

05:02.052 --> 05:04.008
- Good.

05:04.013 --> 05:05.799
Tell me what you know.

05:05.806 --> 05:07.797
- I'm sorry, Commander,
all I know is

05:07.808 --> 05:11.016
he used your research
and he hid her away.

05:11.020 --> 05:14.683
- He used my research...

05:14.690 --> 05:17.602
on Kendry?

05:17.610 --> 05:20.568
Where is Kendry?

05:25.868 --> 05:27.859
- It takes four minutes
to drown.

05:27.870 --> 05:29.906
I'd say you've
drowned and regenerated

05:29.914 --> 05:32.781
over 1,000 times by now.

05:32.792 --> 05:33.998
How's my math?

05:38.088 --> 05:41.330
Very good, Commander.

05:41.342 --> 05:43.924
Finally come for a chat?

05:43.928 --> 05:46.385
- No, Gander.

05:46.388 --> 05:49.004
l have come to break you.

05:52.937 --> 05:54.802
- You got something?

05:54.814 --> 05:57.021
- Well, after our
less-than-awesome war prognosis,

05:57.024 --> 05:58.889
l was studying
the mirror cubes for Dutch,

05:58.901 --> 06:01.859
just pondering our
Hullen ass-to-mouth conundrum.

06:01.862 --> 06:03.398
- You ponder that a lot?

06:03.405 --> 06:05.111
- And I got to thinking,

06:05.115 --> 06:07.401
what if it's not just swanky
locks that make them safe?

06:07.409 --> 06:11.743
So I ran a few diagnostics
and found this.

06:13.082 --> 06:15.744
- Ooh, ahh, you're a genius.
- Shut up.

06:15.751 --> 06:17.116
Now, that awesomeness
you didn't hear

06:17.127 --> 06:18.958
was that silver cube
emitting a frequency

06:18.963 --> 06:20.794
that can't be detected
by human senses.

06:20.798 --> 06:23.835
But if I fire the ship up,

06:23.843 --> 06:25.128
check out what these delicious

06:25.135 --> 06:27.877
little hertzes do
to Hullen tech.

06:30.099 --> 06:33.683
- Whoa.
Complete disruption.

06:33.686 --> 06:36.928
Navs, comms, weapons systems:
All fritzed.

06:36.939 --> 06:38.725
- I think it's got
something to do with how

06:38.732 --> 06:40.188
the Hullen link up neurally
with the ships.

06:40.192 --> 06:42.103
I think they're
communicating via

06:42.111 --> 06:43.647
a frequency on a wavelength
that we can't detect.

06:43.654 --> 06:46.862
But this little baby
disrupts it.

06:46.866 --> 06:48.982
- Johnny, this is good.
This is good shit.

06:48.993 --> 06:50.858
If we can figure out a way to

06:50.870 --> 06:52.110
transmit this on a mass scale,

06:52.121 --> 06:53.986
we can fry them all mid-flight.

06:53.998 --> 06:55.738
- It's not a trap yet,
but it's a good start.

06:55.749 --> 06:57.159
- Can you and Zeph nerd-gang

06:57.167 --> 06:58.873
some giant speaker unit for it?

06:58.878 --> 07:00.209
- A amplifier's not a problem.

07:00.212 --> 07:01.713
The problem is locating

07:01.714 --> 07:03.045
a giant, sonic agitator.

07:03.048 --> 07:06.040
That is a specialty item.

07:06.051 --> 07:07.791
- You need a giant vibrator.

07:07.803 --> 07:10.135
- For science.

07:10.139 --> 07:12.004
And a little pleasure.
But science first.

07:12.016 --> 07:15.133
Solution? There's
a mining clan on Westerley.

07:15.144 --> 07:17.977
Now, they use
a Bio-Frequency Sonic Disruptor

07:17.980 --> 07:19.891
to... to strip-mine
photonic crystals.

07:19.899 --> 07:21.855
It's not perfect, but we can
modify it to make it work.

07:21.859 --> 07:22.939
- So let's go.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.

07:22.943 --> 07:24.479
Hold on a second.

07:24.486 --> 07:26.863
There's this one little problem.

07:26.864 --> 07:30.027
These are not the kind of people
that you buy things from.

07:31.243 --> 07:33.199
Or trade with, or talk to,

07:33.203 --> 07:35.068
or make direct eye contact with.

07:35.080 --> 07:37.036
- So we gotta steal it.

07:37.041 --> 07:38.952
- Oh, we're gonna steal it.

07:38.959 --> 07:40.244
And I know who can help us.

07:42.713 --> 07:45.170
- We come baring gifts, Borna.

07:45.174 --> 07:47.039
- Surprised to get your message.

07:47.051 --> 07:49.212
I heard Killjoys were
going extinct in the Quad.

07:49.219 --> 07:51.210
- And you two are next.

07:51.221 --> 07:54.054
No worries, the RAC's
under new management.

07:54.058 --> 07:55.798
- Jelco?
- Tut-tut-tut.

07:55.809 --> 07:57.845
Guns down, everyone.

07:57.853 --> 07:59.218
We're all old friends here.

07:59.229 --> 08:00.810
If anything,
I owe you two a thank you.

08:00.814 --> 08:02.520
- For what?
Taking you hostage?

08:02.524 --> 08:03.900
Getting you fired?
- Exploding your house?

08:03.901 --> 08:05.107
- Ooh, I forgot about that one.

08:05.110 --> 08:06.896
That's a good one.
- Yeah.

08:06.904 --> 08:09.065
- When your associate Fancy
cut me loose,

08:09.073 --> 08:11.940
I did get into a bit of trouble
in the wilds, it's true.

08:11.951 --> 08:13.487
But Borna here got me out of it.

08:13.494 --> 08:16.110
And we came to
an exciting new arrangement.

08:16.121 --> 08:17.281
- I made him my wife.

08:17.289 --> 08:19.826
- Husband.
The term is husband.

08:19.833 --> 08:21.084
- Turd.
- "Third."

08:21.085 --> 08:22.996
Husband number three.

08:23.003 --> 08:24.834
Not to brag.

08:24.838 --> 08:27.090
- Talk. You want intel
on the Mole Miner Clan.

08:27.091 --> 08:29.252
What are you offering?
- The Royale's finest hokk.

08:29.259 --> 08:31.295
We got three more crates of it.

08:31.303 --> 08:33.885
- Back of the line, turd.

08:33.889 --> 08:36.301
- Is he Borna's prisoner,
or is Jelco into this?

08:36.308 --> 08:38.720
- With him, it's hard to tell.

08:41.063 --> 08:44.897
- The miners are violent,
territorial, and paranoid.

08:44.900 --> 08:48.313
The photonic crystals they mine
are worth a fortune in joy,

08:48.320 --> 08:50.151
but no one has ever managed
to successfully rob them.

08:50.155 --> 08:51.986
- Like I said, assholes.

08:51.991 --> 08:53.356
- Vulnerabilities?
- One.

08:53.367 --> 08:55.073
In transit.

08:55.077 --> 08:56.567
They take the crystals
and all their gear

08:56.578 --> 08:58.785
in a convoy
at the end of each dig.

08:58.789 --> 09:01.201
- Specs on the convoy...
Only thing I couldn't get was

09:01.208 --> 09:03.199
codes for the safe truck
they keep the crystals in.

09:03.210 --> 09:05.041
- It's all right.
We don't need them.

09:05.045 --> 09:06.785
- So if you have all this intel,

09:06.797 --> 09:08.082
why haven't you
robbed them yourselves?

09:08.090 --> 09:09.546
- 'Cause I ain't stupid.

09:09.550 --> 09:11.916
It'd take big brains
and bigger balls

09:11.927 --> 09:13.588
to rob these bastards and live.

09:13.595 --> 09:15.756
- Thank you.
Compliment accepted.

09:21.186 --> 09:23.017
Gander.

09:23.022 --> 09:24.853
Gander.

09:24.857 --> 09:25.812
Gander.

09:28.110 --> 09:30.192
- We're getting tired now,
aren't we?

09:33.282 --> 09:36.240
Your voice...

09:36.243 --> 09:38.279
is dulcet as ever.

09:45.627 --> 09:48.994
- I've slashed your lungs twice,

09:49.006 --> 09:51.418
blinded you four...

09:51.425 --> 09:52.414
- Five.

09:52.426 --> 09:54.917
- Five times.

09:54.928 --> 09:57.385
And I've literally
had your guts for garters,

09:57.389 --> 09:59.846
which, sadly,
wasn't as flattering

09:59.850 --> 10:01.306
as either of us
might have hoped.

10:01.310 --> 10:02.891
- Mm.

10:02.895 --> 10:04.180
- I've searched this ship

10:04.188 --> 10:07.055
high and low.

10:07.066 --> 10:10.058
Where is Kendry?

10:14.198 --> 10:15.984
If you really wanted to know,

10:15.991 --> 10:17.856
you'd let me
connect to the green.

10:17.868 --> 10:19.608
Then you could
go into my memories,

10:19.620 --> 10:21.201
and you could see for yourself.

10:21.205 --> 10:23.912
But you won't,

10:23.916 --> 10:26.999
because you're avoiding it.

10:27.002 --> 10:29.994
Oh, Commander,

10:30.005 --> 10:31.461
are we afraid?

10:34.218 --> 10:38.086
You should be.

10:38.097 --> 10:40.213
- Oh, I'm freed, Gander...

10:42.017 --> 10:45.350
But not of what you think.

10:47.397 --> 10:49.103
- Okay, when we get back to the
RAC, I'll put together a team.

10:49.108 --> 10:50.644
20 or so guys.
Couple armored vehicles.

10:50.651 --> 10:53.393
- No, can't be
a Killjoys-army mission.

10:53.403 --> 10:55.268
- Where have you been?
- With Zeph.

10:55.280 --> 10:57.362
Mani-pedis, pillow fights.

10:57.366 --> 10:59.072
- Uh-huh.

10:59.076 --> 11:01.032
Trust me, this is
literally the kind ofjob

11:01.036 --> 11:02.446
the phrase "you and what army?"
was made for.

11:02.454 --> 11:05.196
- Johnny filled me in.
It's a good plan.

11:05.207 --> 11:06.447
- Okay, but...

11:06.458 --> 11:09.120
- But your secret weapon
only works

11:09.128 --> 11:10.993
if we keep it secret, D'av.

11:11.004 --> 11:13.040
Look, I love our people,
but the last time we tried

11:13.048 --> 11:14.208
a group op, we had a traitor.

11:14.216 --> 11:15.501
And we know how that ended.

11:15.509 --> 11:18.000
- Okay, so,

11:18.011 --> 11:20.423
what's the alternative?
- Us.

11:20.430 --> 11:23.422
The way I see it, this is
a straight-up reclamation gig.

11:23.433 --> 11:25.469
Don't you think, Johnny?

11:25.477 --> 11:29.436
- Well, Westerley is
old-school Killjoy turf.

11:29.439 --> 11:31.395
- So you're in?

11:31.400 --> 11:32.480
- Why not?

11:32.484 --> 11:35.100
One last team mission.

11:35.112 --> 11:37.148
Just us assholes saving the day

11:37.156 --> 11:38.487
while we steal a shiny weapon.

11:38.490 --> 11:41.277
Could be fun.
Remember fun?

11:41.285 --> 11:44.027
- That's the thing that
comes with all the scars, right?

11:44.037 --> 11:45.493
- Only if you do it right.

11:45.497 --> 11:47.988
Buckle up, buttercups.
We're going on a heist.

11:50.752 --> 11:54.415
- Okay, yeah, something is
definitely wrong with her.

11:55.424 --> 11:56.664
- Seriously.

12:02.931 --> 12:05.013
- So, they say the Mole Miner
Clan are impossible to rob.

12:05.017 --> 12:08.100
- Blah, blah, blah, get to
the ass-kickery bit, please.

12:08.103 --> 12:10.560
- They move the photonic
crystals in a safe truck.

12:10.564 --> 12:12.771
That's my sandwich,
your shitty mugs

12:12.774 --> 12:14.901
are the guard vehicles,
the safe is uncrackable,

12:14.902 --> 12:16.858
and outfitted with
dead-man nukes.

12:16.862 --> 12:19.194
You enter the wrong code once...
- And there she blows.

12:19.198 --> 12:20.904
- Igniting all the crystals

12:20.908 --> 12:23.024
and sending everyone
in a 50-mile radius

12:23.035 --> 12:24.150
to a horrific, fiery death.

12:24.161 --> 12:26.026
- | vote for not that.

12:26.038 --> 12:28.029
- Well, luckily we don't
actually want the crystals,

12:28.040 --> 12:30.497
so we are not gonna mess with
the highly explody safe truck,

12:30.500 --> 12:31.785
right, boys and girls?

12:31.793 --> 12:33.533
Hey, hey.

12:33.545 --> 12:36.708
You just ate a gunner.

12:38.425 --> 12:40.507
The grapes represent
the Moles' armed guards,

12:40.510 --> 12:41.966
and these bitches
do not mess around.

12:41.970 --> 12:43.631
Now, the mine gear is
in the rear.

12:43.639 --> 12:46.551
The Sonic Disruptor
will be right there.

12:46.558 --> 12:48.139
- Okay, so we know where
the new dig site is.

12:48.143 --> 12:49.223
How do we know
what route the convoy's

12:49.228 --> 12:51.093
gonna take to get to it?

12:51.104 --> 12:53.846
- If it was my convoy, I'd go
straight through the plains.

12:53.857 --> 12:55.063
Fairly direct.

12:55.067 --> 12:56.102
There's a workable
ambush spot here.

12:56.109 --> 12:57.610
I call dibs.

12:57.611 --> 12:58.942
- Yeah, if we can get the convoy
to stop.

12:58.946 --> 13:00.106
- That's gonna be tricky.

13:00.113 --> 13:01.193
All the vehicles are controlled

13:01.198 --> 13:03.029
with retinal scan ignitions.

13:03.033 --> 13:04.148
And the Moles, they get
a new batch of drivers

13:04.159 --> 13:05.945
every time they move sites.

13:05.953 --> 13:09.992
- Well, it sounds like
we need a woman on the inside.

13:17.589 --> 13:20.956
- Let's do this,
shall we, Gander?

13:20.968 --> 13:24.460
- Well, I can't say I've enjoyed
the foreplay so far, Commander.

13:39.486 --> 13:41.852
I know where Kendry is.

13:41.863 --> 13:43.945
- And now,

13:43.949 --> 13:45.860
the Lady does too.

13:45.867 --> 13:47.653
- So be it.

13:54.042 --> 13:56.203
- Commander, what's happening?

14:01.633 --> 14:06.127
- We're changing course.

14:06.138 --> 14:08.629
Where are we going?

14:08.640 --> 14:12.007
- I think the Lady
wants to have a word with you.

14:17.149 --> 14:19.936
- You know what this is,
don't you, Brynn?

14:19.943 --> 14:22.650
- The core green,
it runs the ship.

14:22.654 --> 14:25.236
- Do you know where this goes?

14:25.240 --> 14:26.650
- Yes.

14:28.660 --> 14:30.491
- Take me there.

14:32.956 --> 14:34.241
Lock the door.

14:39.129 --> 14:40.915
What is all this?

14:40.922 --> 14:42.913
- The library.

14:42.924 --> 14:45.051
Whenever we pass
a new plasma pool,

14:45.052 --> 14:47.634
Gander sends out ships
to bring back samples.

14:47.637 --> 14:49.923
- And what do they use them for?

14:49.931 --> 14:52.013
- You.

14:52.017 --> 14:54.008
Our real job as handmaids

14:54.019 --> 14:57.352
is changing the plasma
you bathe in and drink from,

14:57.356 --> 15:00.018
so Gander can study you
for the Lady.

15:02.069 --> 15:03.184
What's going on?

15:03.195 --> 15:04.605
- It's her.

15:04.613 --> 15:07.195
All this is bonded to her.

15:09.368 --> 15:11.654
- Tell them to stand down.

15:21.004 --> 15:24.167
I can't override her.

15:25.967 --> 15:29.095
As long as she
controls the plasma,

15:29.096 --> 15:31.758
she controls my ship,

15:31.765 --> 15:34.256
she controls my slaves.

15:43.276 --> 15:46.234
She controls me.

15:49.991 --> 15:52.653
Not anymore.

15:59.251 --> 16:01.116
- What are you doing?

16:01.128 --> 16:04.120
- Taking back what's mine.

16:17.144 --> 16:19.760
- Are we safe?
- For now.

16:19.771 --> 16:21.762
We need to get Kendry,

16:21.773 --> 16:25.231
before the Lady
sends reinforcements.

16:27.404 --> 16:29.110
- That's him.

16:29.114 --> 16:31.150
He's one of
the Moles' new drivers.

16:31.158 --> 16:34.116
You gotta get him alone upstairs
so we can take him out quietly.

16:37.164 --> 16:41.373
- Hey, handsome.
Is this seat taken?

16:41.376 --> 16:44.459
It's a shame to drink alone.
Hook a girl up?

16:44.463 --> 16:46.454
- Barkeep's over there.

16:48.341 --> 16:51.174
- Okay, then.

16:54.890 --> 16:57.802
- Well, it's, uh,

16:57.809 --> 17:00.300
hot out there today, huh?

17:00.312 --> 17:04.726
I sure could use
a long, cool drink.

17:10.822 --> 17:12.483
Buy you a drink upstairs?

17:12.491 --> 17:14.072
- Pass.

17:22.334 --> 17:23.824
- Subtle.

17:23.835 --> 17:25.211
- Oh,
like you were any smoother.

17:25.212 --> 17:27.328
He's into guns.
Just not mine.

17:27.339 --> 17:30.797
- Don't have time for this.

17:30.800 --> 17:32.756
Hey, buddy, got a sec?

17:32.761 --> 17:36.219
Sweet package.

17:36.223 --> 17:37.838
Is that a Troubetzkoy Blaster?

17:37.849 --> 17:40.261
- Latest model.
- Never seen one up close.

17:40.268 --> 17:42.725
Looks like it's got some heft.
- Yeah.

17:42.729 --> 17:45.220
But it's not the big guns
you gotta look out for.

17:45.232 --> 17:46.847
It's...

17:46.858 --> 17:48.314
the little pricks
you never see coming.

17:50.362 --> 17:52.227
You okay, guy? Had
a little too much to drink, huh?

17:52.239 --> 17:54.195
- I thought we were
gonna do this somewhere private.

17:54.199 --> 17:55.530
- We were, until it became clear

17:55.534 --> 17:57.365
someone had to
get actual guns out.

17:57.369 --> 18:00.236
- What did I tell you about
incapacitating my customers?

18:00.247 --> 18:01.737
- Keep it in the back rooms...

18:01.748 --> 18:03.113
And not the ones that tip.

18:03.124 --> 18:04.534
- Thank you.

18:04.543 --> 18:06.374
- Even if it determines
the fate of our war?

18:06.378 --> 18:08.243
'Cause I think that deserves
some front-room action.

18:08.255 --> 18:09.791
- Front or back should always be

18:09.798 --> 18:12.915
a pre-game discussion,
sweet cheeks.

18:12.926 --> 18:14.462
Fine.

18:14.469 --> 18:16.551
I'll keep him here
and out of your hair.

18:16.555 --> 18:18.420
- Not done with him yet.

18:20.809 --> 18:21.889
One for me.

18:21.893 --> 18:24.760
- And one for me.

18:31.236 --> 18:33.272
- Three loads today.
Pick your position.

18:33.280 --> 18:35.487
- Kind of into missionary.

18:35.490 --> 18:37.196
- You're in the front, creeper.

18:37.200 --> 18:39.737
-All right.
I'll go familiarize myself.

18:42.455 --> 18:44.241
Tough crowd.

18:44.249 --> 18:45.910
- All right,
Dutch is already in position.

18:45.917 --> 18:47.248
I just need you
to hit the detonator

18:47.252 --> 18:49.208
and stop the convoy on the mark.

18:49.212 --> 18:51.328
You remember which wiry thing
to plant the explosive on?

18:51.339 --> 18:52.875
- Sure.
Base combustion.

18:52.882 --> 18:54.497
Cut the fuel line, wheels stop.

18:54.509 --> 18:56.500
- Just make sure it's the line
and not the tank.

18:56.511 --> 18:58.297
The last thing that we need is

18:58.305 --> 19:00.591
this whole safe truck
to go boom.

19:03.810 --> 19:06.017
- Not my first rodeo, Johnny.

19:06.021 --> 19:07.386
- The bomb is on
a five-second delay.

19:07.397 --> 19:08.386
You got the detonator?

19:08.398 --> 19:09.558
- In my pocket.

19:09.566 --> 19:10.976
- Hey, stop him!

19:10.984 --> 19:12.269
Stop that thief!

19:15.905 --> 19:18.612
Where is it?

19:18.617 --> 19:20.858
He's got a crystal.

19:20.869 --> 19:22.825
All right, listen up, primates.

19:22.829 --> 19:25.946
This is what happens

19:25.957 --> 19:28.790
when you screw with the Moles.

19:36.217 --> 19:37.548
Back to work.

19:37.552 --> 19:40.385
Get that piece of shit
out of here.

19:45.018 --> 19:47.304
- I'm in position.
Meet you at the rendezvous.

19:51.941 --> 19:53.351
- Good to go.

19:53.360 --> 19:55.271
- One last thing.

20:03.662 --> 20:04.777
- What if I have to pee?

20:14.506 --> 20:16.792
- You guys are all about.
- 10:00 and 2:00, huh?

20:16.800 --> 20:18.756
Safety first.

20:18.760 --> 20:20.500
It's a little restrictive.

20:20.512 --> 20:22.468
- You talk too much.

20:22.472 --> 20:23.962
- Hey, Dutch,
the truck in the back

20:23.973 --> 20:25.429
has the Sonic.
The safe truck with the crystals

20:25.433 --> 20:26.764
is in the middle.

20:26.768 --> 20:28.053
Almost in the pipe.
Are you ready?

20:28.061 --> 20:30.427
- For about two hours.

20:30.438 --> 20:31.974
Starting to get a bloody cramp.

20:31.981 --> 20:33.596
- D'av should be
stopping the safe truck

20:33.608 --> 20:34.723
any minute now.

20:34.734 --> 20:36.816
Any minute.

20:36.820 --> 20:39.732
- Okay, well, this is
a little bit awkward, but, uh,

20:39.739 --> 20:41.946
between us boys,

20:41.950 --> 20:43.736
I left the army on a med ticket.

20:43.743 --> 20:45.984
I got this, uh,

20:45.995 --> 20:48.577
well, I guess you could call it
a skin condition.

20:48.581 --> 20:50.492
Moist rash, if you will.

20:50.500 --> 20:52.661
I got a cream in my pocket,
but...

20:52.669 --> 20:54.876
damn these cuffed hands.

20:54.879 --> 20:58.087
- That sounds like
D'av may not be in play.

20:58.091 --> 21:00.047
D'av, you're gonna ride
right past Dutch

21:00.051 --> 21:02.007
in five, four,

21:02.011 --> 21:03.797
three, two...

21:03.805 --> 21:06.592
- Shit.

21:09.769 --> 21:10.975
They've just gone straight past.

21:10.979 --> 21:12.640
What the hells is up with D'av?

21:12.647 --> 21:14.638
- He can't get to the detonator.

21:14.649 --> 21:16.605
- What am I supposed to do,
hitch a bloody ride?

21:16.609 --> 21:18.600
Can you stop them remotely?
EMP?

21:18.611 --> 21:19.942
- No, I can't risk it, not with

21:19.946 --> 21:21.811
the dead-man nukes
on the safe truck.

21:21.823 --> 21:23.734
D'av, you need to hit
that trigger right now.

21:23.742 --> 21:25.698
Use your damn elbow
if you have to.

21:27.495 --> 21:28.826
What the hells?

21:28.830 --> 21:30.536
- Sorry, fellas!

21:30.540 --> 21:31.905
Sometimes
you just gotta scratch.

21:31.916 --> 21:33.907
- The fuel engine will pop
any second.

21:33.918 --> 21:35.829
What was that?

21:38.006 --> 21:39.792
What's happening?

21:39.799 --> 21:41.505
- The safe truck's lost power.

21:41.509 --> 21:43.761
— Got company!
Stop!

21:52.729 --> 21:56.142
You.
Come here.

21:56.149 --> 21:57.685
Keep your eye on this one.

21:57.692 --> 21:59.148
I don't trust him.

22:01.070 --> 22:02.606
- Convoy's halted.

22:02.614 --> 22:04.104
The Sonic truck has two guards.

22:04.115 --> 22:05.821
Time to move, Dutch.

22:05.825 --> 22:07.031
- Yeah, with pleasure.

22:07.035 --> 22:08.696
— Oh, wait, wait,
wait, wait, wait.

22:10.580 --> 22:12.070
We got company.

22:12.081 --> 22:14.697
- Out here?
What are they, dust mites?

22:14.709 --> 22:15.994
- Worse.

22:19.130 --> 22:21.997
- Jelco.

22:22.008 --> 22:24.169
Yeah, always popping up
to ruin the mood.

22:24.177 --> 22:27.635
- That's him,
the STD of villains.

22:27.639 --> 22:29.755
- Good afternoon, gentlemen.

22:29.766 --> 22:30.801
This is a robbery.

22:32.727 --> 22:34.058
- Is this some kind ofjoke?

22:34.062 --> 22:36.678
- I don't think so.
You think so?

22:36.689 --> 22:40.978
Nope, no, this is
quite definitely a robbery.

22:40.985 --> 22:43.237
- You think three men
can take on the Moles?

22:43.238 --> 22:45.854
- Oh, I can do
a few better than that.

22:48.117 --> 22:51.860
And that driver is also a thief.

22:51.871 --> 22:54.032
- Hey.

22:54.040 --> 22:56.031
- Even if you get through us,

22:56.042 --> 22:58.203
you still need the right codes
to get into the safe truck.

22:58.211 --> 23:00.873
OthenNise, the whole thing
blows sky high.

23:00.880 --> 23:02.165
- Look at this face.

23:02.173 --> 23:03.674
Does it look worried?

23:03.675 --> 23:05.711
No.
You know why not?

23:05.718 --> 23:08.004
Because my friend there
has got the codes already.

23:08.012 --> 23:09.673
- No, I don't.

23:09.681 --> 23:11.012
- What do you mean,
no, you don't?

23:11.015 --> 23:12.630
You told Borna
you don't need the codes.

23:18.940 --> 23:20.680
- Oh, shitballs.

23:22.735 --> 23:24.896
- Whoa, whoa, whoa,
that safe truck is

23:24.904 --> 23:26.735
a pants-shittingly powerful
nuclear weapon.

23:26.739 --> 23:28.195
What the hells is Jelco doing?

23:28.199 --> 23:30.736
- Crashing the party,
stealing our crystals.

23:30.743 --> 23:32.995
Now, let's not waste
a sparkly distraction.

23:32.996 --> 23:34.031
I'm grabbing the Sonic.

23:36.040 --> 23:37.826
- Uncuff me, man.

23:39.961 --> 23:44.671
- Don't worry, sailor,
you'll be together soon.

23:44.674 --> 23:46.539
Oh, well, thanks for
keeping the seat warm.

23:50.930 --> 23:52.090
I've got the Sonic!

23:52.098 --> 23:54.680
Time to sail, D'av.

23:56.102 --> 23:58.184
- D'av?

23:58.187 --> 23:59.927
Working on it!

23:59.939 --> 24:01.850
- Okay.

24:01.858 --> 24:03.644
Bringing Lucy round to
the rendezvous in three minutes.

24:03.651 --> 24:05.903
- Yeah.
Get the Sonic out of here.

24:05.904 --> 24:06.893
Don't wait for me.

24:10.950 --> 24:13.282
And there's my backup.

24:21.836 --> 24:23.952
- You were supposed to
make this simple for us.

24:23.963 --> 24:26.124
Why would your lady friend

24:26.132 --> 24:29.090
ignore the big safe full
of photonic crystals entirely?

24:29.093 --> 24:31.004
- She's not into
material things?

24:31.012 --> 24:32.843
- You're going to have to
explain a lot more than that.

24:32.847 --> 24:34.303
- Or...

24:34.307 --> 24:36.969
You could both just die
a real painful death.

24:44.067 --> 24:45.773
- So this is definitely
a good news/bad news.

24:45.944 --> 24:47.980
We got the Sonic...
- But they've got D'av.

24:47.987 --> 24:50.399
The Moles will be in
retreat mode after the attack.

24:50.406 --> 24:53.273
We go in hot, they won't
be expecting it so fast.

24:53.284 --> 24:54.945
- You think we got
enough firepower for that?

24:54.953 --> 24:56.739
Just you and me?

24:56.746 --> 24:58.828
- Well, they've got
two trucks, maybe 12 men

24:58.831 --> 25:00.492
who just blew half
their ammo in the heist.

25:00.500 --> 25:03.287
We've got...
- Company.

25:03.294 --> 25:05.330
- Oh, hey, Borna.

25:05.338 --> 25:06.453
Slabs of meat.

25:06.464 --> 25:08.079
- What the hells is a Sonic?

25:08.091 --> 25:09.422
And why do the Moles
want it back from me?

25:09.425 --> 25:10.926
- Lucy, remember we talked about

25:10.927 --> 25:13.009
not opening the door
for anyone with pamphlets?

25:13.012 --> 25:14.843
- Their pamphlets
had nuke guns, Dutch.

25:14.847 --> 25:16.803
- And we'll use them,
unless you tell me why

25:16.808 --> 25:19.345
my asshat third husband
is in a Mole camp right now.

25:19.352 --> 25:20.512
- Because he ambushed our heist

25:20.520 --> 25:22.431
to steal the Moles' crystals.

25:22.438 --> 25:23.427
- Turd.

25:23.439 --> 25:24.975
— Right?

25:24.983 --> 25:26.723
Also, do you know
any other words?

25:26.734 --> 25:28.440
- If people find out
you've been double-crossing,

25:28.444 --> 25:29.729
it'll be bad for business.

25:29.737 --> 25:30.897
- Right now, my business is

25:30.905 --> 25:32.020
getting his scrawny ass back.

25:32.031 --> 25:33.692
Get that Sonic junk.

25:33.700 --> 25:35.406
- You touch my junk,
I touch yours.

25:35.410 --> 25:37.492
- Borna, think it through.

25:37.495 --> 25:38.860
The minute you hand over this,

25:38.871 --> 25:41.908
they'll kill
Jelco, D'av, and you.

25:44.460 --> 25:47.702
Jelco's my strategy husband.

25:47.714 --> 25:49.045
I need him for this shit.

25:49.048 --> 25:51.755
- Yeah, they've got
my right-hand guy too.

25:51.759 --> 25:53.420
- Hey.
I'm right here.

25:53.428 --> 25:54.838
- You're my left, John.

25:54.846 --> 25:55.926
- That's the handsome one,
right?

25:55.930 --> 25:57.886
- Closest to my heart.

26:00.977 --> 26:03.764
Let's go get our boys back,
shall we?

26:14.115 --> 26:17.152
- Is she... dead?

26:20.580 --> 26:22.411
She's beautiful.

26:23.750 --> 26:25.957
- Incubation overwrite.

26:28.880 --> 26:31.872
And she's alive.

26:31.883 --> 26:33.419
They both are.

26:33.426 --> 26:34.882
- Then why isn't she moving?

26:34.886 --> 26:36.501
- She needs time.

26:36.512 --> 26:39.003
If I wake her too soon,
it may traumatize...

26:39.015 --> 26:40.175
Commander!

26:41.476 --> 26:44.058
- Oh.
Hello.

26:44.062 --> 26:46.053
- We've come to put you
back in your cage.

26:46.064 --> 26:47.554
- Oh, I don't think so.

26:47.565 --> 26:49.146
I don't like cages.

26:49.150 --> 26:50.936
- The Lady sends her regards.

26:50.943 --> 26:54.356
-And I'll be sure
to send her your heads.

27:04.123 --> 27:05.909
- Remember this moment,

27:05.917 --> 27:09.159
so you can pass on the message
to your Lady.

27:09.170 --> 27:12.537
I found the door.

27:12.548 --> 27:14.755
And I know how to close it.

27:29.941 --> 27:32.603
- Miss me?

27:32.610 --> 27:34.566
- Kendry.

27:34.570 --> 27:36.151
l was supposed to save you.

27:37.824 --> 27:39.234
- Are you well?

27:43.246 --> 27:46.579
- I feel strong.

27:46.582 --> 27:47.992
And hungry.

27:51.587 --> 27:54.545
Oh, my...

27:54.549 --> 27:55.629
Am I...

27:55.633 --> 27:57.589
- Don't panic.

27:57.593 --> 27:59.675
- What did they do to me?

27:59.679 --> 28:02.136
- Gander used my research.

28:02.140 --> 28:05.257
It was only a theory, but...

28:05.268 --> 28:06.633
it worked.

28:06.644 --> 28:07.975
- What is this?

28:07.979 --> 28:12.564
- I'm not sure yet.

28:12.567 --> 28:16.151
But it may be the answer
to our problems.

28:16.154 --> 28:18.145
Do you trust me?

28:18.156 --> 28:20.147
-ldo.

28:20.158 --> 28:23.525
- Then we'll figure this out
together.

28:23.536 --> 28:26.073
Do you want to go
and torture Gander for a bit?

28:26.080 --> 28:28.162
— Mm-hmm.
- Okay.

28:28.166 --> 28:30.248
Let's go torture
Gander for a bit.

28:30.251 --> 28:31.991
- Like, a lot of torture.

28:32.003 --> 28:33.209
- Oh, as much as you want.

28:33.212 --> 28:36.420
And ice cream.

28:39.010 --> 28:41.171
- I got word to Borna.

28:41.179 --> 28:43.010
Guess we'll see if
she likes you more than

28:43.014 --> 28:44.299
her last third husband.

28:44.307 --> 28:45.513
- If I were you,
I'd be more worried about

28:45.516 --> 28:46.596
hurting any of her boys.

28:46.601 --> 28:47.716
She's rather fond of them.

28:47.727 --> 28:49.137
- And my boys aren't too fond of

28:49.145 --> 28:51.306
dirt pirates who rip them off.

28:51.314 --> 28:52.975
So you better hope that.

28:52.982 --> 28:54.722
Borna gets here soon
with our machine

28:54.734 --> 28:57.066
before we run out of targets.

28:59.739 --> 29:01.275
- He's just talking tough.

29:01.282 --> 29:03.739
They wouldn't dare
lay a hand on Borna's boys.

29:03.743 --> 29:05.108
- No, don't, please!

29:05.119 --> 29:07.030
- Oh, God.
We're all gonna die.

29:07.038 --> 29:08.574
- Well, maybe you should've
thought about that

29:08.581 --> 29:10.162
before trying to
rob these psychopaths.

29:10.166 --> 29:12.077
- Oh, oh, really?
And what's your excuse?

29:12.084 --> 29:13.665
- We're on a mission
to save the Quad,

29:13.669 --> 29:16.160
and humanity.

29:16.172 --> 29:18.003
Oh, spare me the speeches.

29:18.007 --> 29:19.668
Your real mission
is protecting Dutch,

29:19.675 --> 29:20.960
whether she wants you to or not.

29:20.968 --> 29:22.549
I see the way you look at her.

29:22.553 --> 29:24.054
You'd cut the balls from
a dead man if she asked.

29:24.055 --> 29:25.670
Which I... understand.

29:28.142 --> 29:30.554
The things we do for love, hey.

29:30.561 --> 29:32.677
- I'm not a third husband,
Jelco.

29:32.688 --> 29:34.189
- No, but you are a number two.

29:34.190 --> 29:36.932
- You want to rethink that?

29:36.943 --> 29:38.649
- Well, take me and Borna.

29:38.653 --> 29:40.234
She's got a lot
of muscle around,

29:40.238 --> 29:42.069
especially Number One.

29:42.073 --> 29:44.189
Seen his abs? Is there
such a thing as an eight-pack?

29:44.200 --> 29:46.316
- Jelco, if you wanted help
escaping Borna,

29:46.327 --> 29:48.363
you could havejust told us.

29:48.371 --> 29:50.077
- Escape?

29:50.081 --> 29:52.697
Why would I want to escape?

29:52.708 --> 29:54.084
I love Borna.

29:54.085 --> 29:56.167
- You do?
- Well, of course.

29:56.170 --> 29:59.287
She's powerful and wily.

29:59.298 --> 30:00.583
Delicious curves.

30:00.591 --> 30:02.092
- The way she treats you?

30:02.093 --> 30:03.674
- Well, if you think that's bad,

30:03.678 --> 30:05.259
you've never seen
a Company year-end review.

30:05.263 --> 30:07.219
At least with Borna,

30:07.223 --> 30:10.090
after the berating
and the punching,

30:10.101 --> 30:12.092
there's cuddles.

30:12.103 --> 30:14.094
And then more punching,

30:14.105 --> 30:15.220
the sexy kind.

30:16.983 --> 30:20.646
No, l... I like
where I'm headed, Jaqobis.

30:20.653 --> 30:22.109
Not on top.

30:22.113 --> 30:24.069
Certainly not on bottom.

30:24.073 --> 30:26.189
But right at her side.

30:26.200 --> 30:29.192
That's the only spot
that matters to me.

30:29.203 --> 30:31.194
That's where I shine.

30:34.208 --> 30:35.823
- Dutch is different.

30:35.835 --> 30:37.826
She doesn't want
to lead anymore.

30:37.837 --> 30:39.748
I don't know
how to get through to her.

30:39.755 --> 30:43.794
- Some advice then?

30:43.801 --> 30:47.669
Do you know the key
to a good number two?

30:47.680 --> 30:49.136
- Fiber?

30:49.140 --> 30:53.258
- Give her something
that no one else can,

30:53.269 --> 30:55.635
something she needs,

30:55.646 --> 30:57.102
whether she knows it or not.

30:57.106 --> 30:59.848
- Like a truckload of crystals?

30:59.859 --> 31:01.770
- It was our anniversary.

31:04.447 --> 31:06.312
Oh, gosh, this is it.

31:06.324 --> 31:08.280
- No, no, no, I know
that auto-burst pattern.

31:08.284 --> 31:09.694
That's not the Moles.
That's Dutch.

31:09.702 --> 31:11.158
- Oh, we're saved?

31:11.162 --> 31:12.743
- Well, we are
sitting on a nuke truck.

31:12.747 --> 31:14.738
- It... it can never
be just one thing, can it?

31:20.463 --> 31:22.328
- You fellas ready to come home?

31:25.092 --> 31:28.129
- Borna, darling.

31:28.137 --> 31:30.219
- One husband as promised.

31:30.222 --> 31:34.386
- J‘ There she goes

31:34.393 --> 31:36.475
- I guess he's into it.

31:36.479 --> 31:40.188
- J‘ There she goes

31:40.191 --> 31:42.432
- Try that shit again,
I kill you myself.

31:42.443 --> 31:44.809
But I'm glad you survived.

31:44.820 --> 31:47.903
You can ride up front with me.

31:47.907 --> 31:49.192
- Oh, yes.

31:49.200 --> 31:50.815
Watch your back, Number One.

31:50.826 --> 31:53.863
I'm coming for you.
And your eight-pack.

31:53.871 --> 31:56.408
- So... we good?

31:56.415 --> 31:58.906
My lady.

31:58.918 --> 32:00.499
- They're good.

32:10.930 --> 32:12.591
- Poor little lamb.

32:12.598 --> 32:14.805
Had a bit of a day, have we?

32:14.809 --> 32:16.140
I know the feeling.

32:19.146 --> 32:20.682
- You're looking well.

32:20.689 --> 32:22.816
New haircut?

32:22.817 --> 32:25.229
- I'll almost miss you, Gander.

32:25.236 --> 32:26.692
- Oh, am I going somewhere?

32:26.695 --> 32:28.947
I'll get my bag.

32:28.948 --> 32:31.155
- I can tell you to enjoy
these last few minutes,

32:31.158 --> 32:34.241
but honestly,

32:34.245 --> 32:36.611
I don't want you to.

32:36.622 --> 32:38.738
- You are nothing, you know?

32:38.749 --> 32:40.705
Just another pretty doll,

32:40.709 --> 32:43.792
trying to reach outside her box,

32:43.796 --> 32:46.913
until I made you special.

32:46.924 --> 32:50.337
- See, this is
your fundamental problem.

32:50.344 --> 32:54.553
You keep underestimating me.

32:54.557 --> 32:56.172
This is about free will,

32:56.183 --> 32:57.889
which you took from me

32:57.893 --> 33:00.305
and no longer get to have.

33:02.773 --> 33:04.149
- No.

33:04.150 --> 33:06.892
- You put something in me,
Gander.

33:06.902 --> 33:09.609
So now,

33:09.613 --> 33:12.605
I'm putting something in you.

33:12.616 --> 33:15.824
Take him to the chair.
- No.

33:18.247 --> 33:20.238
- Ground up all
the other three Hullen.

33:20.249 --> 33:22.956
Transfuse them all.
- No.

33:22.960 --> 33:25.292
- Except... Brynn.

33:25.296 --> 33:27.787
She earned her reward.

33:27.798 --> 33:29.834
Feeling better?
- I will.

33:29.842 --> 33:31.628
I've got a list
of degrading things

33:31.635 --> 33:33.921
Ican't wait to make him do.

33:33.929 --> 33:35.840
Who was he working for, Aneela?

33:35.848 --> 33:37.008
If not you, then...

33:37.016 --> 33:38.722
- We call her the Lady.

33:38.726 --> 33:40.216
She lives in the green.

33:40.227 --> 33:42.218
- Like the way
you can go inside it?

33:42.229 --> 33:44.311
- Yes, but she's stuck there.

33:44.315 --> 33:46.647
And she wants out.

33:46.650 --> 33:47.981
- Out?

33:50.779 --> 33:52.940
How?

33:52.948 --> 33:54.904
- I ran everything
like you asked.

33:54.909 --> 33:57.901
| stripped your double helixes
to their backbones.

33:57.912 --> 34:00.198
You and Aneela are
virtually identical,

34:00.206 --> 34:01.742
except for one thing.

34:01.749 --> 34:02.909
You're her chiral.

34:02.917 --> 34:05.329
- Her what?

34:05.336 --> 34:07.952
- A double helix spins, right?

34:07.963 --> 34:11.376
Your DNA spins in the
opposite direction of Aneela's,

34:11.383 --> 34:12.998
like a flipped image.

34:13.010 --> 34:16.343
The right strands of her DNA
are the left of yours.

34:16.347 --> 34:19.885
That's not
supposed to be possible.

34:19.892 --> 34:21.848
So...

34:21.852 --> 34:24.309
what the hells
is going on, Dutch?

34:24.313 --> 34:26.349
- Remember when I told you that

34:26.357 --> 34:28.348
Aneela can do tricks
in the green?

34:28.359 --> 34:29.815
- Yeah, she can
go inside memories.

34:29.818 --> 34:33.857
-And she can bring things back.

34:33.864 --> 34:36.822
She brought me
out of the green, Zeph.

34:36.825 --> 34:38.952
Took me from a memory.

34:38.953 --> 34:41.865
What's that make me?

34:41.872 --> 34:43.863
- Wait.

34:43.874 --> 34:46.365
Which pool of green plasma
did she pull you from?

34:46.377 --> 34:47.867
- Hers.

34:47.878 --> 34:49.664
- Hers?

34:49.672 --> 34:52.914
- She made it from
her spinal fluid, her green.

34:52.925 --> 34:54.961
- Whoa.
Okay.

34:54.969 --> 34:57.005
Hang on,
we need to think this through

34:57.012 --> 34:59.719
until we understand the rules,
rework our plan of attack.

34:59.723 --> 35:01.304
- No, we don't.
- You aren't getting it.

35:01.308 --> 35:05.051
In Hullen terms, Aneela
may be your original source.

35:05.062 --> 35:07.303
- I know.
- You need a demonstration.

35:07.314 --> 35:09.054
- Zeph?

35:09.066 --> 35:11.682
I know.

35:11.694 --> 35:14.777
I just needed to be sure.

35:14.780 --> 35:16.862
It's okay.

35:16.865 --> 35:18.480
- No, it's not.

35:24.456 --> 35:28.040
This is not okay.

35:28.043 --> 35:30.375
- We finally have
our secret weapon.

35:30.379 --> 35:33.121
The armada will
always have more ships.

35:33.132 --> 35:34.918
So, rangers,
we need your people to scout

35:34.925 --> 35:37.132
and find an ideal site
for war on the ground.

35:37.136 --> 35:38.922
- How do we lure them
into a ground fight?

35:38.929 --> 35:40.760
- We'll need some kind of bait.

35:40.764 --> 35:43.016
Then we deploy the Sonic
once their ships approach.

35:43.017 --> 35:45.884
And then...

35:45.894 --> 35:47.759
Cut their numbers in half
with one stroke.

35:47.771 --> 35:50.353
- Half of them is still
as assload more than all of us.

35:50.357 --> 35:51.938
- If you want to be a pessimist.

35:51.942 --> 35:53.478
- And if the Sonic
disrupts their ships,

35:53.485 --> 35:54.895
won't it disrupt our
Black Root ships too?

35:54.903 --> 35:56.768
- Yeah, we're working on that,
okay?

35:56.780 --> 35:58.395
- This plan has
an awful lot of moving parts.

35:58.407 --> 36:00.398
- Are you fighting this war
because it's easy?

36:00.409 --> 36:02.149
Or because it's important?

36:02.161 --> 36:03.947
- It's a good plan, you guys.

36:03.954 --> 36:06.070
- Enough!

36:06.081 --> 36:08.788
I'm tired of hearing
how strong the Hullen are,

36:08.792 --> 36:10.328
that they're unbeatable,

36:10.336 --> 36:11.997
because in battle,
they're one entity.

36:12.004 --> 36:13.540
What one knows, they all know.

36:13.547 --> 36:15.412
What one wants, they all want.

36:15.424 --> 36:17.085
- You're not helping.
- You are.

36:17.092 --> 36:18.957
The weapon that John
is building right now

36:18.969 --> 36:20.470
changes that.

36:20.471 --> 36:22.052
It disrupts their connection.

36:22.056 --> 36:23.921
Separated, they are
no different than us.

36:23.932 --> 36:25.468
- Counterpoint:
They still have instant healing

36:25.476 --> 36:27.512
and superior strength.

36:27.519 --> 36:29.055
The Hullen have no weakness.

36:29.063 --> 36:30.849
- Oh,
the Hullen have a weakness.

36:33.942 --> 36:36.479
Aneela.

36:36.487 --> 36:40.196
Numbers don't count
without free will.

36:40.199 --> 36:43.441
They're not a million soldiers;
They're one soldier.

36:43.452 --> 36:45.943
One voice:

36:45.954 --> 36:47.910
Hers.

36:47.915 --> 36:49.030
So it doesn't matter

36:49.041 --> 36:51.908
how many more legs a spider has.

36:51.919 --> 36:54.080
All you have to do

36:54.088 --> 36:56.830
is cut off its head.

36:56.840 --> 36:59.331
Kill Aneela,

36:59.343 --> 37:01.129
win the war.

37:04.556 --> 37:06.808
- Have you decided
what you want to do?

37:07.601 --> 37:09.011
- Not yet.

37:09.019 --> 37:10.930
In my defense,
not exactly the type of decision

37:10.938 --> 37:14.726
| pictured making as a Hullen.

37:14.733 --> 37:18.567
— How did you first
become Hullen?

37:18.570 --> 37:21.061
- I had an arrangement
with your father.

37:21.073 --> 37:23.780
Protect his interests
during the Quad handover,

37:23.784 --> 37:25.740
he'd transform me
once it was done.

37:25.744 --> 37:29.862
But I failed.

37:29.873 --> 37:31.613
- Papa didn't like failure.

37:31.625 --> 37:33.365
- Neither do I.

37:33.377 --> 37:34.958
But the conversion tools
were still buried

37:34.962 --> 37:38.796
beneath Spring Hill,
so I improvised.

37:38.799 --> 37:40.289
- Hm.

37:42.803 --> 37:45.385
Why did you first
bring me here, Aneela?

37:47.766 --> 37:50.758
- Papa trusted you.

37:50.769 --> 37:52.805
So I thought I might too.

37:54.398 --> 37:55.854
What's the point of
living forever

37:55.858 --> 37:58.565
if you have to do it all alone?

37:58.569 --> 38:00.309
Gander has been dosing me

38:00.320 --> 38:03.687
with so much green
all this time.

38:03.699 --> 38:05.985
l have so many memories

38:05.993 --> 38:08.359
swimming in my head.

38:08.370 --> 38:13.706
I've tried to
fix myself for so long.

38:13.709 --> 38:15.825
You're the only thing
that's worked.

38:18.130 --> 38:20.963
You're my tether, Kendry.

38:25.763 --> 38:29.722
- She's going to keep coming
for us, isn't she, the Lady?

38:31.810 --> 38:34.677
- Let her.

38:34.688 --> 38:36.974
I have hated Dutch

38:36.982 --> 38:40.941
for so long it blinded me.

38:40.944 --> 38:44.152
But I figured out a way
to destroy her...

38:44.156 --> 38:47.694
and the Lady too.

38:47.701 --> 38:50.989
- Two bitches, one stone.

38:50.996 --> 38:52.736
- I need you

38:52.748 --> 38:57.412
to do something for me first.

38:57.419 --> 39:01.082
You're not gonna like it.

39:14.436 --> 39:17.098
- That's pretty.

39:17.105 --> 39:19.687
-Aw, thanks.

39:21.652 --> 39:22.892
I meant your tune.

39:22.903 --> 39:26.862
Your pottery is
still a hate crime.

39:26.865 --> 39:28.071
You know,
ever since you got back

39:28.075 --> 39:31.033
from your Remnant acid trip,

39:31.036 --> 39:34.699
you have been
in a very good mood.

39:34.706 --> 39:37.038
- We just got a weapon that
can take out half the Hullen

39:37.042 --> 39:38.873
and had some heisty goodness.

39:38.877 --> 39:40.458
What's not to be happy about?

39:40.462 --> 39:42.703
- Yeah, that's what
I'm trying to figure out.

39:42.714 --> 39:44.921
'Cause this is weird.

39:44.925 --> 39:47.211
Something's weird.
You're weird.

39:47.219 --> 39:49.801
- Oh, because I'm humming?

39:49.805 --> 39:52.763
Yeah, I'm a real monster.

39:55.060 --> 39:56.220
- What happened
in the Remnant, Dutch?

39:56.228 --> 39:57.684
What did you see?

39:57.688 --> 39:59.053
- I told you.

39:59.064 --> 40:03.228
Just old family photos,
baby shoes.

40:03.235 --> 40:04.850
Aneela can do parlor tricks.

40:04.862 --> 40:06.944
- Bullshit.

40:06.947 --> 40:08.812
There's more to it.

40:08.824 --> 40:13.067
— Nothing relevant to the war,
General.

40:13.078 --> 40:14.488
- Yeah, that right there,

40:14.496 --> 40:15.997
that's how I know
something's up.

40:15.998 --> 40:17.954
It's not like you
to step back from a fight.

40:17.958 --> 40:19.539
- I am not.

40:19.543 --> 40:21.955
I know what I have to do.
- Kill Aneela?

40:21.962 --> 40:23.122
We need something more concrete.

40:23.130 --> 40:24.745
You need a plan.

40:24.756 --> 40:25.836
- I have a plan.

40:25.841 --> 40:28.753
- Then tell me.

40:28.760 --> 40:31.923
I'm the guy you don't protect
from ugly shit.

40:31.930 --> 40:33.921
Why start now?

40:35.934 --> 40:38.721
- Okay.
Fine.

40:41.273 --> 40:43.264
Aneela made me.

40:43.275 --> 40:46.517
From her green.

40:46.528 --> 40:49.816
I'm part of her.

40:51.950 --> 40:55.784
What does that mean, made you?
That...

40:55.787 --> 40:57.493
that... that doesn't
even make sense.

40:57.497 --> 41:00.113
- All that matters
is that it's true.

41:00.125 --> 41:02.912
That's how I'm tied to her.

41:02.920 --> 41:05.753
Aneela's my original source,
D'av.

41:09.259 --> 41:13.093
- This is Hullen 101, Dutch.
If...

41:13.096 --> 41:16.588
you kill Aneela...

41:16.600 --> 41:18.306
- I die too.

41:24.274 --> 41:27.061
That's why you're the general.

41:27.069 --> 41:30.277
I need you
to think like one now.

41:30.280 --> 41:34.774
Johnny would put me first.

41:34.785 --> 41:39.154
And you know
that can't happen, right?

41:39.164 --> 41:41.200
But with John's new toy,

41:41.208 --> 41:45.998
we can distract
the Hullen force.

41:46.004 --> 41:48.620
Minimal casualties.

41:48.632 --> 41:50.543
l sneak onto the armada.

41:50.550 --> 41:52.927
- And then what?

41:52.928 --> 41:54.589
- I take down Aneela,

41:54.596 --> 41:56.302
like an assassin,

41:56.306 --> 42:00.094
like I was raised to.

42:00.102 --> 42:02.309
When I end Aneela,
the war ends too.

42:02.312 --> 42:04.268
No one else has to die.

42:07.275 --> 42:11.063
- Except you.

42:11.071 --> 42:15.064
- You can't save me
without losing this war.

42:15.075 --> 42:19.193
And if we lose this war,
she's gonna kill me anyway.

42:19.204 --> 42:22.788
All that I ask is to get to
take that bitch with me.

42:27.921 --> 42:30.128
That's my plan.

42:41.601 --> 42:43.057
- Okay.

42:50.318 --> 42:54.607
- J‘ There she goes

42:54.614 --> 42:57.276
J” That angel in my eyes

42:57.284 --> 43:01.197
J' I love her

43:01.204 --> 43:04.537
J' For she is my dream
