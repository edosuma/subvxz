00:26.896 --> 00:28.854
<i>What's good, Cloak-Bot?</i>

00:28.898 --> 00:31.422
Checking in to see
how things are going.
Did you get the book?

00:31.466 --> 00:33.076
<i>Book secure.</i>

00:33.120 --> 00:35.078
<i>Why that's great!
W-Wait!</i>

00:35.122 --> 00:38.560
<i>That-- That's book three.
You rusty bucket!
I need book two.</i>

00:38.603 --> 00:40.127
<i>Book two out of stock.</i>

00:40.170 --> 00:42.085
Olms have mercy.

00:42.129 --> 00:44.479
Next you're gonna tell me
Anne isn't dead yet.

00:44.522 --> 00:47.134
<i>Working on it.</i>

00:47.177 --> 00:50.180
Well, looks like we'll
have to up the stakes.

00:53.531 --> 00:55.794
<i>You have one hour
to destroy that kid,</i>

00:55.838 --> 00:59.276
<i>or the bomb planted
in your chest
will destroy you.</i>

01:01.235 --> 01:03.585
<i>Okay, cool. Andrias out.</i>

01:22.734 --> 01:24.562
<i>A blood-thirsty predator</i>

01:24.606 --> 01:29.219
<i>meets all-American engineering
inFumigator 4.</i>

01:41.579 --> 01:43.103
Ah!

01:43.973 --> 01:45.801
Ooh!

01:47.368 --> 01:51.067
You know, Anne,
it really is remarkable
how much you have grown.

01:51.111 --> 01:52.634
Aw, thanks, Mom.

01:52.677 --> 01:55.289
I mean, you used to be
so irresponsible.

01:55.332 --> 01:58.074
Like "change the grade
on your report card"
irresponsible.

01:58.118 --> 02:00.207
Didn't think
you guys knew about that.

02:00.250 --> 02:02.209
But you really
changed.

02:02.252 --> 02:06.387
And you have been
so up-front and honest
with us this whole time.

02:06.430 --> 02:09.390
Right. Up-front and honest.

02:09.433 --> 02:11.392
We're just so proud
of you.

02:11.435 --> 02:13.568
- Come here, sweetie.
- Bring it in.

02:15.439 --> 02:17.398
Hey! I'm gonna go
get some coffee ice cream.

02:17.441 --> 02:18.790
Anyone want any?

02:18.834 --> 02:20.749
- Sprig?
- Eh, I'm good.

02:20.792 --> 02:22.664
Whoa!
Hey, what gives?

02:22.707 --> 02:24.187
I can't do this anymore.

02:24.231 --> 02:26.102
What?
Eat coffee ice cream?

02:26.146 --> 02:28.278
I agree.
It's pretty risky
after 5:00.

02:28.322 --> 02:31.542
No! My folks.
I never told them
about Andrias,

02:31.586 --> 02:34.197
or the robot hunting us,
or the honking invasion.

02:35.807 --> 02:37.766
They think I'm being
up-front and honest,

02:37.809 --> 02:38.984
but I'm not.

02:39.028 --> 02:40.769
But you said this was

02:40.812 --> 02:42.423
the only way they'd be okay
with any of this.

02:42.466 --> 02:43.989
I know, but it's not right.

02:44.033 --> 02:46.557
I'm going to tell them
everything, right now.

02:46.601 --> 02:48.429
- Great.
- Mom, Dad.

02:48.472 --> 02:50.474
There's something
I have to tell you.

02:50.518 --> 02:51.823
What is it, sweetie?

02:53.042 --> 02:55.218
Well, the thing is...

02:56.524 --> 02:57.960
What the heck was that?
Huh?

03:00.049 --> 03:02.617
- Anne, what's going on?
- Get down!

03:04.358 --> 03:06.229
Everyone upstairs.
Move.

03:06.273 --> 03:08.231
Quick!
Into my workout room.

03:08.275 --> 03:11.930
Okay, we can hide out here,
while we... um...

03:14.281 --> 03:17.109
Mom, this is not a workout room!

03:17.153 --> 03:19.155
Yes it is.
When I thought you ran away,

03:19.199 --> 03:20.896
it's where I work out
all my stress.

03:20.939 --> 03:22.854
Wait. Why is this one
dressed like a doctor?

03:22.898 --> 03:25.161
A mom can dream, can't she?

03:25.205 --> 03:27.859
Why do I get the feeling
I'm not living up
to your expectations?

03:34.910 --> 03:37.521
<i>Multiple Anne Boonchuy's
confirmed.</i>

03:37.565 --> 03:39.393
It's after you?
What?

03:39.436 --> 03:40.394
<i>Eliminating.</i>

03:47.575 --> 03:51.796
Okay. Maybe there's
a couple of things
I haven't told you guys.

04:04.940 --> 04:07.638
Honey, why is there
a robot chasing us?

04:07.682 --> 04:09.945
Well, the thing is--
And I was totally
gonna tell you.

04:09.988 --> 04:12.382
The King of Amphibia
kinda has it out for us...

04:12.426 --> 04:14.645
She punched him
in the face!

04:14.689 --> 04:16.081
Anne!
You what?

04:16.125 --> 04:17.518
Eyes on the road!
Eyes on the road!

04:25.352 --> 04:26.744
Hey! No bark.

04:26.788 --> 04:29.181
Can't this robo-snail
go any faster?

04:29.225 --> 04:32.359
I'm sorry, I'm not use to
running for my life
from a crazy robot.

04:32.402 --> 04:36.711
I know just how you feel, Mr. B.
Why, the first time
that robot attacked us--

04:36.754 --> 04:38.713
This isn't
the first time?

04:38.756 --> 04:39.757
You're not helping!

05:02.563 --> 05:05.870
Oof! Your backhand is
looking pretty rusty.
Dad!

05:13.965 --> 05:16.707
Looks like they started filming
the next <i>Fumigator</i> movie
early.

05:16.751 --> 05:19.362
There's a split coming up!
Which freeway should I take?

05:19.406 --> 05:22.931
I don't know, the 405?
At this hour? It'll be jammed!

05:22.974 --> 05:25.629
- Guys?
- Hang on. I'll look at traffic
on my app.

05:25.673 --> 05:28.415
Make sure
you don't use MapSearch.
That one is no good!

05:29.546 --> 05:30.547
Dad, turn!

05:45.345 --> 05:46.433
Hopefully, he stops.

05:46.476 --> 05:48.652
All right, Dad!
That was awesome!

05:48.696 --> 05:50.480
Can you take me
for driving lessons?

05:53.222 --> 05:55.790
Did we lose it?
I hope so.

06:07.715 --> 06:09.499
Hurry, everyone.
Hide.

06:21.859 --> 06:24.427
Okay, guys.
I think we're safe
for now.

06:24.471 --> 06:27.561
Anne Savisa Boonchuy,
what is going on?

06:27.604 --> 06:30.694
What do you mean?
There's a giant robot
trying to kill us.

06:30.738 --> 06:32.566
I thought that was clear.
Yes.

06:32.609 --> 06:35.569
But why, Anne? Why?
Is there something
you want to tell us?

06:35.612 --> 06:37.440
Mom, take it easy.

06:37.484 --> 06:39.050
Honey, maybe
we should hear her out.

06:39.094 --> 06:40.791
No! She's lying to us!

06:40.835 --> 06:42.663
You've done something
haven't you?

06:42.706 --> 06:44.534
That's why that thing
is after us!

06:44.578 --> 06:46.014
It's complicated.

06:46.057 --> 06:48.495
I knew it!
We were wrong
about you.

06:48.538 --> 06:51.802
You're still the same
irresponsible little girl
who used to cut class.

06:51.846 --> 06:55.676
When are you going to grow up?
When are you going to stop
getting in trouble?

06:55.719 --> 06:57.068
When, Anne? When?

06:57.112 --> 06:59.375
I don't know, okay?

07:01.508 --> 07:04.336
I don't know
when I'll be the daughter
you want me to be.

07:04.380 --> 07:07.731
And I'm sorry.
It's true, I did lie.

07:07.775 --> 07:10.386
But I did it
to protect the people
I really care about.

07:12.214 --> 07:14.129
Hey...

07:14.172 --> 07:17.524
I've learned
so much from you two
these past few weeks.

07:17.567 --> 07:20.091
I finally appreciate
how much you've done for me.

07:20.135 --> 07:21.571
Now I'm asking for your help.

07:22.790 --> 07:24.879
Please.
I can't do this
without you.

07:26.402 --> 07:28.622
We're with you, Anne.
Right, Mom?

07:28.665 --> 07:31.668
I don't know.
Isn't this all
just too much?

07:39.371 --> 07:42.549
So, is there a plan?
Really hoping for a plan.

07:45.987 --> 07:48.990
Hey, Mom, feel like putting
your artistic skills to use?

07:59.653 --> 08:00.480

08:03.613 --> 08:06.921

Lookin' for me?

08:11.839 --> 08:14.319
Whoa, mama! You work fast!

08:14.363 --> 08:16.365
It's all about rhythm, baby.

08:25.853 --> 08:26.723
Now, guys!

08:40.737 --> 08:42.391
Ah! No, no, no!

08:45.089 --> 08:47.744
<i>Target confirmed.
Mission complete.</i>

08:47.788 --> 08:49.354
Hey, robot!

08:49.398 --> 08:51.313
Leave my daughter alone!

09:07.634 --> 09:09.810
Wow, Mom! Good arm!

09:09.853 --> 09:11.812
You, too.

09:11.855 --> 09:14.292
Whoa.
That was crazy,
you guys.

09:14.336 --> 09:16.599
I like your style,
Mrs. B.

09:16.643 --> 09:19.907
Were you surprised
by that display of ferocity,
Mr. Boonchuy?

09:20.777 --> 09:21.822
No.

09:24.041 --> 09:27.436
<i>Self-destruct
in T-minus ten... nine...</i>

09:27.479 --> 09:29.438
Oh, no!
That thing's still loaded.

09:29.481 --> 09:32.702
What do we do?
All that and we're still toast?

09:32.746 --> 09:34.051
Not on my watch!

09:58.685 --> 10:00.774
Anne?
What was that?

10:00.817 --> 10:05.169
Gosh, guys.
I have so much to tell you.

10:11.959 --> 10:15.440
Honestly, Mrs. Boonchuy,
Anne has just been trying to--

10:15.484 --> 10:17.660
Protect you three.
I get it now.

10:17.704 --> 10:20.837
Whatever it is
you guys need to do,
we'll do it together.

10:20.881 --> 10:22.056
Aw...

10:22.099 --> 10:23.797
Aw.

10:23.840 --> 10:25.929
The driver always gets
left out of the group hug.

10:25.973 --> 10:28.628
Can you guys
just imagine I'm there?

10:31.108 --> 10:33.850
Get HQ on the line.
This may be the real deal.
