00:12.012 --> 00:13.613
I'm sure i'm the
last person you ever

00:13.648 --> 00:16.033
wanted to hear from again.

00:16.068 --> 00:18.418
I mean, you probably hate me.

00:18.453 --> 00:20.820
But i really...

00:21.221 --> 00:23.623
i really need to see you,
brennan.

00:23.658 --> 00:26.826
And to finally say i'm sorry.

00:27.227 --> 00:29.229
And give you back
your share of the money.

00:33.233 --> 00:35.635
I really need to see you
brennan.

00:35.670 --> 00:38.438
And to finally say i'm sorry.

00:46.446 --> 00:50.450
...and give you back
your share of the money.

00:50.850 --> 00:53.653
You can find me at
our old apartment and just...

00:54.054 --> 00:56.456
just don't tell
anyone about this, okay?

01:10.470 --> 01:12.037
Hey.

01:12.072 --> 01:13.673
Where you going?

01:14.074 --> 01:15.275
Nowhere.

01:32.492 --> 01:34.494
Hey, kid, watch
where you're going.

01:38.898 --> 01:40.299
Hey, nice car.

01:40.334 --> 01:42.219
Gt dual carbs?

01:42.254 --> 01:44.104
Of course.

01:44.504 --> 01:46.506
Mom's waiting
for you in the alleyway.

01:46.541 --> 01:48.508
She says the
apartment's not safe.

01:48.543 --> 01:49.674
Oh, yeah?

01:49.709 --> 01:50.910
Who's your mom?

01:50.945 --> 01:52.112
Who do you think?

02:14.934 --> 02:17.337
Oh, you came.

02:22.942 --> 02:24.544
You knew i would.

02:24.579 --> 02:26.111
What's going on?

02:26.146 --> 02:30.550
I've really messed up this time.

02:30.585 --> 02:31.716
Brennan, i am so scared.

02:31.751 --> 02:34.153
You know, for a minute
there, i actually thought

02:34.188 --> 02:36.556
that you were going
to apologize and give me back

02:36.591 --> 02:37.722
my money.

02:37.757 --> 02:39.359
I guess i'm just an idiot, huh?

02:39.394 --> 02:40.960
No, i am sorry.

02:40.995 --> 02:42.127
Okay?

02:42.162 --> 02:42.962
So there's...

02:43.363 --> 02:44.929
there's your apology, right?

02:44.964 --> 02:46.566
And i will get you your
money back at some point.

02:46.601 --> 02:47.985
Yeah.

02:48.020 --> 02:49.334
Yeah.

02:49.369 --> 02:50.935
So what'd you pull this time,
becky?

02:50.970 --> 02:53.373
Look, it's serious,
or i wouldn't have called.

02:53.408 --> 02:54.539
So?

02:54.574 --> 02:55.740
Call the cops.

02:55.775 --> 02:56.576
I can't go to the cops.

02:56.611 --> 02:58.943
They're involved.

02:58.978 --> 03:00.580
The... the cops,
the feds, you name it.

03:00.980 --> 03:02.182
You know what, that's just...

03:03.383 --> 03:04.984
and i'm sorry, but
you're just going to have to

03:05.019 --> 03:06.603
dig your own
way out of this one.

03:06.638 --> 03:08.188
All right, then,
don't do it for me.

03:08.588 --> 03:10.190
Do it for your son.

03:16.596 --> 03:18.598
Aw, that's a good one, becky.

03:18.633 --> 03:20.165
Drop the act. Okay?

03:20.200 --> 03:21.801
I'm not one of your marks.

03:22.202 --> 03:24.604
I'm on the level, brennan.

03:24.639 --> 03:26.606
Connor's your son.

03:26.641 --> 03:30.975
Look at him.

03:31.010 --> 03:33.813
Go keep an eye out, okay?

03:34.214 --> 03:34.614
Okay.

03:40.220 --> 03:41.821
I wasn't even going
to tell you, but...

03:41.856 --> 03:42.987
you know what? Stop.

03:43.022 --> 03:44.224
You called me up looking
for protection...

03:44.624 --> 03:45.390
mom!

03:45.425 --> 03:47.392
...then when i say...

03:47.427 --> 03:51.431
damn it, you were followed.

03:53.833 --> 03:56.236
Get your stuff.

03:56.271 --> 03:57.837
Come on.

04:00.640 --> 04:01.806
Feds!

04:01.841 --> 04:03.042
Nice to see you're
not neglecting his education.

04:07.046 --> 04:09.048
Come on.

04:14.654 --> 04:18.257
Ah...!

04:34.274 --> 04:36.241
I am adam kane.

04:36.276 --> 04:39.479
I was a pioneer of genetic
research, manipulating

04:39.514 --> 04:42.682
dna to save human lives.

04:43.082 --> 04:46.286
But in many their
genes unexpectedly mutated.

04:46.321 --> 04:49.088
They developed
super-human abilities.

05:17.116 --> 05:21.721
Together with four of
the most powerful i fight to

05:21.756 --> 05:26.326
protect a world that
doesn't even know we exist.

05:26.726 --> 05:27.927
We are...

05:28.328 --> 05:30.330
mutant x.

05:34.767 --> 05:35.933
So what have you got?

05:35.968 --> 05:37.170
Well, we've been monitoring
the police scanners.

05:37.205 --> 05:38.736
Check this out.

05:38.771 --> 05:40.373
We pulled this cop
cam footage off the police

05:40.408 --> 05:41.539
database.

05:41.574 --> 05:42.775
It just went down.

05:46.379 --> 05:47.980
It's impossible to
tell if the electrical charge

05:48.015 --> 05:50.748
came from a weapon
or from a mutant.

05:50.783 --> 05:53.185
Well, if it was a weapon,
the most something that

05:53.220 --> 05:55.588
size could throw off
would be about a thousand amps.

05:55.988 --> 05:57.990
Any way of figuring
out the intensity of the arc

05:58.025 --> 05:59.992
by checking out the cop car?

06:00.027 --> 06:01.594
It's worth a try.

06:10.403 --> 06:14.006
Okay, you need to
tell me what's going on.

06:14.041 --> 06:15.973
Connor, go outside, please.

06:16.008 --> 06:17.610
What are you going
to tell him that i don't

06:17.645 --> 06:18.811
already know?

06:19.212 --> 06:22.415
Look, just go play somewhere
i can see you, all right?

06:22.450 --> 06:23.616
Whatever.

06:28.421 --> 06:30.388
All right, becky,
so who'd you con this time?

06:30.423 --> 06:32.425
Look, it didn't start out
that way, all right, brennan?

06:32.460 --> 06:33.626
No, no, it never does, does it?

06:34.026 --> 06:36.629
Give me the name.

06:36.664 --> 06:39.197
Daniel foster.

06:39.232 --> 06:40.833
The guy running for congress?

06:40.868 --> 06:42.400
Uh huh.

06:42.435 --> 06:43.636
We got to know each
other pretty well and...

06:44.837 --> 06:46.839
you were just going
to play him up against the wall?

06:46.874 --> 06:48.040
Yeah.

06:48.441 --> 06:49.642
And then i found out
he liked to carry around a

06:49.677 --> 06:51.644
lot of cash.

06:52.044 --> 06:54.046
So you picked his pocket?

06:54.081 --> 06:55.613
No.

06:55.648 --> 06:58.250
He liked to carry around
a briefcase full of cash.

06:58.285 --> 07:00.770
So i got him into the
habit of letting me hold it

07:00.805 --> 07:03.256
when he got into the
car and then i'd hand it to

07:03.291 --> 07:04.457
him through the window.

07:04.857 --> 07:06.459
Yeah, until the last
time, when you handed him a

07:06.494 --> 07:08.426
different briefcase.

07:08.461 --> 07:09.262
Except that there was
something else inside the

07:09.662 --> 07:11.063
briefcase.

07:11.098 --> 07:12.465
It was a disc.

07:12.865 --> 07:14.266
I mean, i don't even
know what's on it, but it

07:14.301 --> 07:15.668
must be valuable because
he's been trying to kill

07:15.703 --> 07:18.836
me since i took it.

07:18.871 --> 07:20.873
I'm going to sell
the disc back to him.

07:20.908 --> 07:22.074
That's where you come in.

07:22.475 --> 07:23.241
No.

07:23.276 --> 07:24.677
No, that's not where i come in.

07:24.712 --> 07:26.196
I'm not helping
you blackmail him.

07:26.231 --> 07:27.680
Well, then, i'm as good as dead.

07:28.080 --> 07:28.881
And so's connor.

07:29.282 --> 07:30.448
No. I got a place
that we can stay.

07:30.483 --> 07:31.684
I got a friend of
mine that has his own high

07:32.084 --> 07:32.885
government contacts.

07:33.286 --> 07:34.887
No. Foster has
friends everywhere.

07:35.288 --> 07:37.255
This has to be
totally under the radar.

07:37.290 --> 07:39.292
I mean, you can't
be in contact with anyone.

07:48.901 --> 07:50.102
All right. Fine.

07:50.137 --> 07:51.269
I'll help you.

07:51.304 --> 07:53.706
But i'm not just going
to disappear, so i need to

07:54.106 --> 07:55.308
make a call.

07:55.343 --> 07:56.909
Thanks.

08:06.118 --> 08:07.320
Hey, adam.

08:07.720 --> 08:09.722
Hey, i'm sorry i haven't
checked in with you, man.

08:10.122 --> 08:11.324
I lost track of time.

08:11.359 --> 08:12.490
I understand.

08:12.525 --> 08:13.691
I appreciate the call.

08:13.726 --> 08:15.328
Last time i saw you,
you bolted out of here

08:15.363 --> 08:17.695
without saying two words.

08:17.730 --> 08:20.132
All right, here's two
words for you: I'm sorry.

08:20.167 --> 08:22.134
What happened to you?

08:22.535 --> 08:24.336
Oh, you know, i got
a friend that came in to town

08:24.371 --> 08:26.138
last minute and i was
afraid i was going to miss him.

08:26.173 --> 08:27.740
So when are you heading back?

08:27.775 --> 08:29.307
Uh, you know...

08:29.342 --> 08:30.943
actually, uh,
he's getting married.

08:30.978 --> 08:32.945
Wants me to be his best man.

08:33.346 --> 08:34.947
When's the wedding?

08:35.347 --> 08:37.549
Uh, a couple of days.

08:37.585 --> 08:39.717
Hey, check it out.

08:39.751 --> 08:41.719
I gotta run, so let me...

08:41.754 --> 08:43.356
let me call you when i can, huh?

08:43.390 --> 08:44.557
Wait, where are you?

08:44.592 --> 08:46.559
Wait, hey...

08:54.967 --> 08:56.168
ah, you did it.

08:56.203 --> 08:57.370
Now do it again.

08:57.770 --> 08:59.372
Hey, bernadette,
have a good lunch?

08:59.407 --> 09:00.573
Where's ernie?

09:00.608 --> 09:02.139
Ernie?

09:02.174 --> 09:04.577
Come on, what
have you got for me?

09:08.180 --> 09:09.381
God, i could kiss you.

09:09.416 --> 09:10.583
Don't get your hopes up.

09:12.585 --> 09:16.188
The polls have me up
ten points over the incumbent.

09:16.223 --> 09:18.190
I got this thing
practically sewn up.

09:18.225 --> 09:21.394
Not if that disc goes public.

09:21.429 --> 09:24.962
It won't.

09:24.997 --> 09:28.200
Come on, this girl's
no erin brockovitch, trust me.

09:28.235 --> 09:31.404
Oh, she'll sniff around
for her little payoff and

09:31.804 --> 09:33.406
then she'll be out of here.

09:33.806 --> 09:35.808
Save the bull
for your constituents.

09:35.843 --> 09:37.810
We have a real problem here.

09:38.210 --> 09:40.212
If you lose this
election, i don't land the

09:40.247 --> 09:41.779
defence contract.

09:41.814 --> 09:44.617
I have people on
this and we will find her.

09:44.652 --> 09:46.584
Not if she sees him first.

09:46.619 --> 09:49.422
I think it's
time to use my guys.

09:49.457 --> 09:51.789
Come on...

09:51.824 --> 09:55.393
i mean, is that
really necessary?

09:55.428 --> 09:59.031
I'm not willing to let
some smalltime con woman do

09:59.066 --> 10:02.635
anything to jeopardize
this election.

10:16.248 --> 10:17.850
What are you doing?

10:18.250 --> 10:20.653
I'm sorry,
but i don't buy's "buddy
from out of town" speech.

10:20.688 --> 10:22.655
There's something else going on.

10:22.690 --> 10:23.673
Really?

10:23.708 --> 10:24.622
Yeah.

10:24.657 --> 10:26.258
I sensed it the
moment he took off.

10:26.293 --> 10:27.860
He was...

10:28.260 --> 10:29.862
you know, all wound up.

10:30.262 --> 10:33.431
Not a guy going
to meet an old friend.

10:33.466 --> 10:35.067
What, so that gives
you the right to just rifle

10:35.102 --> 10:38.270
through his things?

10:38.305 --> 10:39.472
You're right.

10:39.872 --> 10:41.073
I'm sorry.

10:41.108 --> 10:42.239
It's just...

10:42.274 --> 10:43.876
the hit i got off
of him was really strong.

10:43.911 --> 10:45.843
You know?

10:45.878 --> 10:48.280
He was overwhelmed
by these hurt and unresolved

10:48.315 --> 10:50.683
emotions.

10:51.083 --> 10:55.453
Well, why didn't you say so?

10:55.488 --> 10:58.691
I mean, that's as good
as a search warrant in my books.

11:01.894 --> 11:03.896
Let's see...

11:06.298 --> 11:08.701
i'm sure i'm the last person
you ever wanted to see again.

11:08.736 --> 11:11.068
I mean, you probably hate me.

11:11.103 --> 11:17.510
Brennan, i
really need to see you and
to finally say i'm sorry...

11:17.545 --> 11:19.111
i should've figured it out.

11:19.146 --> 11:20.312
You know this woman?

11:20.347 --> 11:21.078
Yeah.

11:21.113 --> 11:22.314
Not just any woman.

11:22.715 --> 11:23.881
Becky dolan.

11:23.916 --> 11:26.118
Out of high school,
she was brennan's world.

11:26.153 --> 11:28.320
And some time after
that she ripped him off,

11:28.355 --> 11:31.123
disappeared,
and broke his heart.

11:31.158 --> 11:33.491
Yeah, weli...

11:33.526 --> 11:35.928
looks like she found
a way to wrap him around her

11:36.328 --> 11:38.330
little finger again.

12:06.358 --> 12:11.163
Well, lunch is served.

12:11.564 --> 12:13.165
I never thought i'd
ever see this dump again.

12:13.566 --> 12:15.167
Yeah, you and me both.

12:15.568 --> 12:18.370
So is there where
all the magic happened?

12:21.173 --> 12:23.175
Shut up.

12:26.378 --> 12:27.945
No, really.

12:27.980 --> 12:29.582
How long has it been
since you've seen each other?

12:35.187 --> 12:36.353
Connor, why don't you...

12:36.388 --> 12:39.557
i don't know, go grab some
wood or something for fire?

12:39.592 --> 12:41.994
Even since he showed up you've
been trying to get rid of me.

12:42.029 --> 12:43.160
Oh, yeah?

12:43.195 --> 12:44.396
Well, it's just because
you're so annoying.

12:44.797 --> 12:46.363
Yeah.

12:46.398 --> 12:49.602
Listen to your mother.

12:50.803 --> 12:52.004
Whoa!

12:52.404 --> 12:54.006
Am i gonna get to do that?

12:54.406 --> 12:55.608
Just because he can,
doesn't necessarily mean

12:55.643 --> 12:57.174
you'll be able to.

12:57.209 --> 12:59.211
I was just trying to
ask my father some questions.

12:59.612 --> 13:03.215
Hey. If you were able
to do that you'd know by now.

13:03.616 --> 13:04.416
Damn it.

13:04.817 --> 13:06.383
Watch your language.

13:06.418 --> 13:08.420
Go get some wood
like your mother asked you.

13:18.030 --> 13:19.231
What a piece of work.

13:19.632 --> 13:22.034
Yeah, that's your kid.

13:30.843 --> 13:32.009
I've missed you, you know?

13:32.044 --> 13:33.646
Yeah, well, you should've
thought about that

13:34.046 --> 13:36.413
before you cleaned
me out and took off.

13:36.448 --> 13:38.050
Aw, come on, it's the
only thing i've ever been

13:38.085 --> 13:39.617
any good at.

13:39.652 --> 13:41.053
I'll give you that.

13:41.088 --> 13:42.419
You're definitely good.

13:42.454 --> 13:44.021
Well, i want
out of the game now.

13:44.056 --> 13:46.458
I don't have the
stomach for it anymore.

13:46.493 --> 13:48.861
Is that why
you're using me again?

13:51.664 --> 13:54.867
I didn't have anywhere
else to turn, brennan.

13:55.267 --> 13:56.068
You know, i...

13:56.468 --> 13:58.470
i hid the disc and
i need your help to get it back.

13:58.505 --> 14:00.489
Connor knows where it is.

14:00.524 --> 14:02.474
C'mon, is that using you?

14:02.875 --> 14:05.643
Yeah?

14:05.678 --> 14:08.480
At least i know what i'm
getting myself into this time.

14:08.515 --> 14:12.484
Kinda curious what's
on that disc myself.

14:12.519 --> 14:14.486
I really have missed you.

14:35.307 --> 14:36.508
Hey, guys...

14:36.909 --> 14:39.677
i got the wood...

14:39.712 --> 14:42.514
definitely has your timing.

14:42.915 --> 14:44.081
Yeah.

14:44.116 --> 14:48.921
So, are we going
to go get the disc or what?

14:49.321 --> 14:51.323
Yeah.

15:00.933 --> 15:04.536
All right, put her through.

15:04.571 --> 15:06.155
Hello, daniel.

15:06.190 --> 15:07.740
Hmm, my rebecca.

15:08.140 --> 15:10.342
I wasn't sure i was
going to hear from you again.

15:10.377 --> 15:12.544
Well, i have something
of yours that seems to be

15:12.579 --> 15:14.511
in rather high demand.

15:14.546 --> 15:16.548
Hmm, i suppose you've
had enough time to come up

15:16.583 --> 15:17.750
with a price?

15:18.150 --> 15:19.351
Two million.

15:19.386 --> 15:21.318
Done.

15:21.353 --> 15:24.556
I'll call you when
i'm ready to do the exchange.

15:26.959 --> 15:28.560
Did you manage
to trace the call?

15:28.595 --> 15:29.762
Yes.

15:30.162 --> 15:31.363
Yes.

15:31.764 --> 15:34.566
Becky dolan, natalie
jones, lucy warner.

15:34.967 --> 15:36.168
Which one did brennan fall for?

15:36.568 --> 15:38.170
The original recipe.

15:38.205 --> 15:39.336
But she's hot.

15:39.371 --> 15:40.973
It's not hard to imagine
why he fell so hard.

15:41.008 --> 15:42.940
Yeah, i don't
think she's so special.

15:42.975 --> 15:44.176
Yeah, well, the question
is what's he doing with

15:44.211 --> 15:46.143
her now?

15:46.178 --> 15:47.980
Well, whatever
it is, it isn't good.

15:48.015 --> 15:49.782
I tested the police
car and based on the

15:50.182 --> 15:51.383
disintegration of
the metal, there is no doubt

15:51.784 --> 15:53.385
that the force
of that arc came from...

15:53.420 --> 15:54.586
brennan

15:54.987 --> 15:56.153
uh huh.

15:56.188 --> 15:57.389
I don't know anybody
else capable of firing off a

15:57.424 --> 15:58.590
charge like that.

15:58.991 --> 15:59.792
So why would he do this?

16:00.192 --> 16:01.393
Yeah, and why did he lie to us?

16:01.428 --> 16:02.960
Well, maybe he's ashamed.

16:02.995 --> 16:06.198
Or maybe he's trying
to protect somebody.

16:12.604 --> 16:14.606
Who are they?

16:15.007 --> 16:18.210
They are my most lethal
black op soldiers who died

16:18.245 --> 16:21.013
during classified operations.

16:22.214 --> 16:24.616
They're living... but not
in the conventional sense.

16:25.017 --> 16:27.820
They have limited brain
function which i control

16:27.855 --> 16:30.222
by an implant.

16:30.257 --> 16:31.423
My god...

16:41.033 --> 16:42.634
find rebecca dolan.

16:43.035 --> 16:47.039
Get the disc she
has in her possession.

16:47.439 --> 16:50.642
Then kill her and
anyone else she's come in

16:50.677 --> 16:53.062
contact with.

16:53.097 --> 16:55.273
Understood?

16:55.308 --> 16:57.449
Move out.

17:10.929 --> 17:12.531
So, you in school?

17:12.931 --> 17:14.897
You don't have
to act interested.

17:14.933 --> 17:16.935
Mom already told me
you're not into the whole

17:16.970 --> 17:18.137
father thing.

17:19.338 --> 17:20.939
I didn't even know
i was a father until today.

17:20.973 --> 17:22.106
Yeah, whatever.

17:22.141 --> 17:24.143
Hey, kid, i'm just
going at this whole thing

17:24.178 --> 17:25.709
blind, just like you.

17:25.743 --> 17:27.346
Fine, i'll cut you some slack.

17:27.746 --> 17:30.114
Thanks.

17:30.149 --> 17:31.750
So is this where your
mom hid the disc or are you

17:31.785 --> 17:33.317
just scamming
me for a free lunch?

17:33.352 --> 17:35.754
It'll cost you a burger
and fries to find out.

17:35.789 --> 17:37.356
Get in there.

17:42.161 --> 17:45.329
Hey, adam.

17:45.364 --> 17:48.567
Look what the photo
database turned up on becky.

17:54.173 --> 17:55.374
Recognize the guy she's with?

17:55.409 --> 17:56.540
Yeah.

17:56.575 --> 17:57.741
It's daniel foster.

17:57.776 --> 17:59.343
He's the guy
running for congress.

17:59.378 --> 18:01.780
Picture was taken about
a week ago at a fundraiser.

18:02.181 --> 18:04.583
My guess, she screwed
with the wrong guy.

18:04.618 --> 18:06.985
Now she needs
brennan to protect her.

18:07.020 --> 18:08.187
That's weird.

18:08.587 --> 18:09.388
What?

18:09.788 --> 18:10.989
I think i recognize
the guy in the background.

18:11.024 --> 18:12.591
Can you enhance that image?

18:12.626 --> 18:14.193
Yeah.

18:16.995 --> 18:18.197
Larger?

18:25.003 --> 18:27.606
Oh, man.

18:27.641 --> 18:30.174
Who is he?

18:30.209 --> 18:31.375
Stephan bailey.

18:31.410 --> 18:33.011
Is he a friend of yours?

18:33.046 --> 18:34.978
Not exactly.

18:35.013 --> 18:37.415
He was a heavyweight
in special ops 'til he went

18:37.450 --> 18:39.818
into the private sector
and made a fortune with

18:39.853 --> 18:42.986
high tech weaponry.

18:43.021 --> 18:45.023
So what's a guy like
that doing at a fundraiser?

18:45.058 --> 18:46.590
Exactly.

18:46.625 --> 18:48.227
Buying himself a politician.

18:51.029 --> 18:52.831
All right, that's
your third burger.

18:52.866 --> 18:54.633
When do you plan
on getting to work?

18:54.668 --> 18:56.635
Just give me a quarter.

18:57.035 --> 18:59.037
Damn, you really
are like your mom.

18:59.072 --> 19:01.440
Okay, just give it to me.

19:01.475 --> 19:13.452
All right.

19:15.854 --> 19:17.456
Hey, lady, i
just tried pressing c-12.

19:17.491 --> 19:19.823
This thing just ate my money.

19:19.858 --> 19:22.661
Oh, i've been meaning
to put a sign on this thing.

19:22.696 --> 19:24.263
It's been on the fritz.

19:24.663 --> 19:26.665
I bet it would cost an
arm and a leg to fix it, huh?

19:26.700 --> 19:28.484
Worse than plumbers, kid.

19:28.519 --> 19:30.269
I bet my dad could fix it.

19:30.304 --> 19:31.835
Yeah?

19:31.870 --> 19:32.871
I don't know.

19:32.906 --> 19:33.872
Oh, no, no.

19:34.273 --> 19:35.439
Trust me.

19:35.474 --> 19:37.476
If it's an electrical
problem i'm definitely your man.

19:37.876 --> 19:39.878
I'll tell you what,
if you can get this thing

19:39.913 --> 19:42.281
working, your lunch is on me.

19:42.681 --> 19:44.283
You got it.

19:49.488 --> 19:51.890
It'll just take me a
few minutes to figure it out.

19:51.925 --> 19:54.258
It was c-12.

19:54.293 --> 19:57.896
Hey lady, can i maybe
have a piece of pie to go?

19:57.931 --> 19:58.697
Sure.

19:59.097 --> 20:01.500
Why not?

20:33.532 --> 20:34.698
Ahh.

20:34.733 --> 20:35.934
Thanks for the free lunch.

20:36.335 --> 20:37.135
Let's go.

20:37.536 --> 20:39.137
Hold on, honey,
you forgot your pie.

20:39.172 --> 20:40.739
Ah, it's not good
for his teeth anyway.

20:40.774 --> 20:41.540
Come on.

20:41.575 --> 20:43.542
No.

20:47.546 --> 20:48.712
Nice work, "dad".

20:48.747 --> 20:51.149
I guess we make
a pretty good team.

20:51.550 --> 20:52.716
Oh, great.

20:52.751 --> 20:53.952
So you think your
buddy would mind two more

20:53.987 --> 20:56.720
crashing his wedding?

20:56.755 --> 20:57.956
You know, i'd appreciate
it if you guys would just

20:58.357 --> 20:59.958
turn around and
pretend you never saw me.

20:59.993 --> 21:01.525
They're hot.

21:01.560 --> 21:03.527
Connor, get in the car.

21:03.562 --> 21:05.163
Come on, tell me.
Are they single?

21:05.198 --> 21:10.334
Connor, get in the car.

21:10.369 --> 21:13.572
Brennan, do you have any idea
what this woman got you into?

21:13.607 --> 21:15.574
Got it under control.

21:15.609 --> 21:16.740
Really?

21:16.775 --> 21:18.777
What, by exploding
cop cars and almost exposing

21:18.812 --> 21:20.344
mutant x?

21:20.379 --> 21:21.945
I told you, i've
got it under control.

21:21.980 --> 21:24.383
Brennan,
foster's people aren't about
to back down on this one.

21:24.783 --> 21:26.785
I can handle it.

21:26.820 --> 21:28.387
Excuse me.

21:44.002 --> 21:50.409
Oh my god...

21:50.809 --> 21:52.411
oh my god.

22:00.819 --> 22:01.820
Mom?

22:01.855 --> 22:03.539
No!

22:03.574 --> 22:05.188
Mom!

22:05.223 --> 22:06.425
Brennan, mom's in trouble.

22:17.636 --> 22:19.638
Uh...!

22:22.841 --> 22:24.443
I don't have it!

22:24.843 --> 22:25.644
I don't have the disc.

22:26.044 --> 22:26.810
Agh!

22:26.845 --> 22:28.046
Let me go.

22:28.081 --> 22:29.247
Ugh!

22:50.635 --> 22:52.637
Shh!

22:53.438 --> 22:54.639
Okay, i'll handle this.

22:55.040 --> 22:55.806
I have to help her.

22:55.841 --> 22:57.442
I said i'll take care of it.

22:57.477 --> 22:59.444
Keep the car running.

22:59.479 --> 23:00.863
Go.

23:00.898 --> 23:02.247
Okay.

23:09.855 --> 23:11.822
I don't have the disc.

23:11.857 --> 23:15.060
Tell your boss that he's wrong.

23:15.095 --> 23:16.261
You know where it is.

23:16.661 --> 23:19.464
If i knew where it
was i think i'd tell you.

23:21.466 --> 23:24.634
Hey!

23:24.669 --> 23:26.271
You don't want to do that.

23:30.675 --> 23:32.277
Run!

24:05.110 --> 24:06.311
Come on!

24:23.929 --> 24:27.132
I looked right in their eyes
and there was nothing there.

24:27.167 --> 24:28.333
Yeah, i know.

24:28.733 --> 24:31.136
But, brennan, if you had
gotten there one minute later

24:31.171 --> 24:33.155
i'd be dead by now.

24:33.190 --> 24:35.140
Fork over some cash.

24:35.175 --> 24:36.741
I'm hungry.

24:37.142 --> 24:37.908
What?

24:37.943 --> 24:39.344
Are you kidding me?

24:39.379 --> 24:41.463
You have a hollow leg?

24:41.498 --> 24:43.548
Having a growth spurt.

24:43.583 --> 24:45.115
Here.

24:45.150 --> 24:47.552
Bring me the change.

24:50.355 --> 24:52.322
What're you doing?

24:52.357 --> 24:53.959
Well, i think it's
time that we figure out what

24:53.994 --> 24:55.926
all this excitement is about.

24:55.961 --> 24:57.162
No, i don't think
i want to see that.

24:57.197 --> 24:58.363
Oh, come on.

24:58.763 --> 25:00.365
If you got the stomach
for blackmail, you should

25:00.765 --> 25:02.367
definitely be
able to handle this.

25:10.775 --> 25:12.377
So what's on it?

25:12.777 --> 25:14.379
It's a list of illegal
contributions made to the

25:14.779 --> 25:17.182
foster campaign.

25:17.217 --> 25:18.348
What?

25:18.383 --> 25:19.950
They're willing
to kill me over this.

25:19.985 --> 25:21.586
This disc will not only bring
down foster, it'll bring

25:21.621 --> 25:23.588
down every corporation
that's ever lined his

25:23.623 --> 25:24.754
pockets.

25:24.789 --> 25:26.356
Brennan, we had a deal.

25:26.391 --> 25:28.393
Yeah, that was before
i saw what was on this disc.

25:28.428 --> 25:31.213
That disc is not yours to keep...
well, it's not

25:31.248 --> 25:33.999
yours either, and
i'm not giving you a choice.

25:34.399 --> 25:35.565
Huh ho.

25:35.600 --> 25:37.602
You are exactly the same.

25:38.003 --> 25:41.006
You won't play unless
you get to call all the shots.

25:41.041 --> 25:44.009
I know a place where
you and connor can be safe.

25:44.044 --> 25:45.175
I got a guy that i trust.

25:45.210 --> 25:47.212
I just have to
get the disc to him.

25:47.247 --> 25:48.013
Hey, what's going on?

25:48.413 --> 25:49.179
Nothing.

25:49.214 --> 25:50.415
Your father's
just letting us down.

25:50.815 --> 25:52.817
Hey, you know...
end of discussion.

25:52.852 --> 25:54.419
All right.

25:54.819 --> 25:55.585
Fine.

25:55.620 --> 25:57.222
Whatever you want.

26:02.027 --> 26:03.628
Take connor here,
and lock the door.

26:04.029 --> 26:05.195
Take it!

26:05.230 --> 26:07.232
It's nothing fancy
but it's going to be fine,

26:07.267 --> 26:08.033
okay?

26:08.433 --> 26:09.634
Go inside, and wait for me.

26:09.669 --> 26:11.253
Okay?

26:11.288 --> 26:12.863
Fine.

26:12.898 --> 26:14.439
Come on.

26:22.847 --> 26:24.014
Hey adam

26:24.049 --> 26:25.615
brennan, where you been?

26:25.650 --> 26:27.217
Sorry, i've
been a little tied up.

26:27.252 --> 26:30.455
Yeah, well, you have no
idea what you're involved in.

26:30.490 --> 26:32.457
Yeah, well, i'm beginning
to get an idea from my

26:32.857 --> 26:34.059
run-in with the walking dead.

26:34.459 --> 26:36.461
The qj-14s are built
to be virtually unstoppable.

26:36.861 --> 26:38.428
Yeah, tell me
something i don't know.

26:38.463 --> 26:40.064
I'm trying to find a
frequency that controls them,

26:40.099 --> 26:41.666
but at this point,
i don't know what they're after.

26:41.701 --> 26:43.233
Aw, they're after
a disc that becky stole.

26:43.268 --> 26:44.869
It's got a list of illegal
campaign contributions.

26:45.270 --> 26:46.436
Okay, good.

26:46.471 --> 26:48.073
All right, you got
to let us help you, though.

26:48.108 --> 26:49.274
Well, that's fine.

26:49.674 --> 26:51.276
But i need you to arrange
for protection for
becky and her son.

26:51.311 --> 26:53.678
We're on it.

26:54.079 --> 26:56.481
Becky, i thought i
told you to lock the...

26:57.282 --> 27:00.050
becky, connor!

27:00.085 --> 27:00.885
Becky, what happened?

27:00.920 --> 27:02.052
Where's connor?

27:02.087 --> 27:03.288
Oh, god, they took him.

27:03.323 --> 27:04.506
Those things took him.

27:04.541 --> 27:05.716
Where did they take him?

27:05.751 --> 27:06.856
Oh, this is all my fault.

27:06.891 --> 27:08.093
If i hadn't been
so greedy, this wouldn't...

27:08.493 --> 27:09.694
listen to me. Tell me where
they took connor.

27:10.095 --> 27:11.261
I'll find them.

27:11.296 --> 27:12.897
They said i had to
meet them and give them the

27:12.932 --> 27:14.316
disc or they
were going to kili...

27:14.351 --> 27:15.665
they're going to kill my boy...

27:15.700 --> 27:17.667
listen, i'm not going
to let that happen, okay?

27:17.702 --> 27:19.704
Now tell me, where do they
want you to make the switch?

27:19.739 --> 27:20.905
They said there's a...

27:21.306 --> 27:23.308
a gazebo in the middle
of ridgewood park and i

27:23.343 --> 27:24.909
have to leave the
disc there in one hour.

27:25.310 --> 27:26.111
Okay, where's the disc?

27:26.511 --> 27:28.878
It's up there.

27:28.913 --> 27:32.517
Oh... god, if anything happens
to him i don't know what i'm...

27:32.552 --> 27:35.320
shh... shh, listen, nothing's
going to happen to him,

27:35.355 --> 27:36.486
i promise you.

27:36.521 --> 27:38.523
Nothing is going
to happen to him, okay?

27:38.558 --> 27:40.490
I'll find him.

27:40.525 --> 27:41.726
Please, brennan, get him back.

27:41.761 --> 27:43.328
I will. Stay here.

28:05.750 --> 28:08.553
Yeah, the gazebo in
ridgewood park, in one hour.

28:08.588 --> 28:10.572
I'll be there, with your money.

28:10.607 --> 28:12.557
You have to promise to back off.

28:12.957 --> 28:14.559
I don't want him hurt.

28:14.594 --> 28:16.161
You'll get your money.

28:16.561 --> 28:20.565
Say, rebecca, that's what
you wanted all along, isn't it?

28:20.965 --> 28:24.969
You didn't just
do what i think you did.

28:25.004 --> 28:27.772
You set
brennan up, didn't you?

28:27.807 --> 28:29.339
It's not like that.

28:29.374 --> 28:30.975
Was going to turn over
the disc and we were going

28:31.376 --> 28:32.977
to end up with nothing.

28:33.012 --> 28:34.579
So what did you do?

28:34.979 --> 28:37.382
Look, baby, i just did what
i had to do for us to survive.

28:37.417 --> 28:39.384
Tell me now, or
i'll hate you forever.

28:39.419 --> 28:43.353
I told...

28:43.388 --> 28:46.791
i told brennan they were
going to kill you...

28:46.826 --> 28:50.195
unless he turned over
the disc in ridgewood park.

28:50.230 --> 28:51.796
Oh, connor, don't
look at me like that.

28:52.197 --> 28:53.763
I did this for us.

28:53.798 --> 28:55.800
They promised they're
not going to hurt him.

28:55.835 --> 28:57.001
You're selfish, you know that?

28:57.402 --> 28:59.404
One thing screwing
over complete strangers,

28:59.439 --> 29:01.406
but how could you
do this to my father?

29:05.443 --> 29:07.245
Would you stop that?
You're making me nervous.

29:07.280 --> 29:09.047
Brennan's just running
a little late, that's all.

29:09.082 --> 29:10.248
No, he's blowing us off.

29:10.283 --> 29:11.815
I can feel it.

29:11.850 --> 29:13.416
What, are you emma now?

29:13.451 --> 29:15.053
No, it goes deeper than that.

29:15.088 --> 29:16.619
I just...

29:16.654 --> 29:19.057
he really likes that woman.

29:19.457 --> 29:21.259
You know, that
woman does have a name.

29:21.294 --> 29:23.061
Yeah, i got my
own special name for her.

29:23.096 --> 29:24.662
Ooh, mee-ow.

29:25.063 --> 29:26.229
In case you haven't noticed,

29:26.264 --> 29:28.266
becky's managed to play
brennan from the start.

29:53.491 --> 29:57.495
I'm trying to tap into the
band frequency of the qj-14s.

29:57.530 --> 29:59.898
I believe that they're
controlled by an infrared

30:00.298 --> 30:02.300
beam which taps into
the temporal lobes of the

30:02.700 --> 30:04.702
brains of these...
dead soldiers.

30:04.737 --> 30:05.904
Yeah.

30:06.304 --> 30:08.306
God, i still can't believe
this whole thing is real.

30:08.341 --> 30:11.074
Oh, it is, believe me.

30:11.109 --> 30:13.511
So you're somehow trying
to tap into their brains?

30:13.912 --> 30:15.078
Yeah.

30:15.113 --> 30:17.515
And i'm hoping that this
sequence will allow me to do it.

30:29.127 --> 30:30.728
Brennan

30:34.732 --> 30:35.934
what are you doing here?

30:36.334 --> 30:37.535
Mom lied.

30:37.570 --> 30:38.701
What?

30:38.736 --> 30:39.937
Look at that.

30:39.972 --> 30:41.139
What is it?

30:46.344 --> 30:47.510
I'm okay.

30:47.545 --> 30:49.347
Get out of here.

30:49.382 --> 30:51.149
Get out of here now!

30:55.954 --> 30:57.155
Where is he?

31:08.766 --> 31:09.933
It's a diversion.

31:09.968 --> 31:11.970
Pursue the original target.

31:15.974 --> 31:17.976
Can't you shut
these things down?

31:18.011 --> 31:20.343
No.

31:20.378 --> 31:22.345
Because the infrared
spectrum is a lot more

31:22.380 --> 31:25.183
complex than a radio
frequency, but luckily, the

31:25.218 --> 31:27.185
qj-'s tracking signal
is showing me their

31:27.585 --> 31:29.187
location.

31:29.587 --> 31:31.589
Well, we better get
shal and jessie over there now.

31:31.624 --> 31:33.591
Brennan's going to
need all the help he can get.

31:42.800 --> 31:43.967
No, it's...

31:44.002 --> 31:45.203
i can't do this anymore.

31:45.238 --> 31:46.004
Wha...

31:46.404 --> 31:49.607
what are you talking about?

31:49.642 --> 31:51.574
Look around.

31:51.609 --> 31:52.810
Even those things
you created have failed to

31:53.211 --> 31:54.012
achieve their mission.

31:54.412 --> 31:55.613
They haven't failed.

31:56.014 --> 31:57.215
We just need to remain patient.

31:58.416 --> 32:00.018
Well, i'm not willing
to sit silently anymore.

32:00.418 --> 32:02.420
No.

32:02.820 --> 32:05.222
You do what i tell you.

32:05.257 --> 32:07.625
I created you, remember?

32:07.660 --> 32:08.791
No.

32:08.826 --> 32:10.628
No, you created
those walking zombies.

32:10.663 --> 32:12.395
I'm not taking
your commands anymore.

32:12.430 --> 32:14.432
Yeah, i'm coming clean
before all this breaks in

32:14.467 --> 32:15.633
the news.

32:16.034 --> 32:17.200
I could still win this election.

32:17.235 --> 32:20.038
When the press paints me as
the victim of this scandal.

32:21.239 --> 32:23.241
You are a victim.

32:23.641 --> 32:25.443
What?

32:25.478 --> 32:27.245
Agh!

32:36.054 --> 32:38.456
Foster was prepared
to pay us two million dollars.

32:38.491 --> 32:39.474
You're nuts.

32:39.509 --> 32:40.784
No, it's true.

32:40.819 --> 32:42.025
He promised.

32:42.060 --> 32:43.261
Let's say that's true.

32:43.296 --> 32:44.427
Then what?

32:44.462 --> 32:45.863
Then "what" what?

32:45.898 --> 32:47.230
Then we're done.

32:47.265 --> 32:49.267
Then we can have
enough to live on and start

32:49.302 --> 32:50.468
having a normal life.

32:50.503 --> 32:52.070
With brennan?

32:52.470 --> 32:54.472
You like him, don't you?

32:54.507 --> 32:58.041
Yeah.

32:58.076 --> 33:01.644
Yeah, i like him too.

33:01.679 --> 33:04.482
But he's
got other responsibilities,
other people

33:04.517 --> 33:06.884
he lives and works with.

33:06.919 --> 33:08.051
So what?

33:08.086 --> 33:10.088
Maybe just the
three of us can hang out.

33:10.123 --> 33:16.059
We're his family.

33:16.094 --> 33:18.896
Look, i gotta tell you
something that is going to

33:19.297 --> 33:21.699
make you hate me.

33:22.100 --> 33:24.102
Brennan's not my father, is he?

33:24.137 --> 33:26.869
No.

33:26.904 --> 33:30.073
Look, i'm sorry, baby.

33:30.108 --> 33:32.310
It's just if i hadn't
lied to you, i couldn't make

33:32.345 --> 33:34.512
him believe it, too,
and i couldn't afford to take

33:34.547 --> 33:36.531
that chance for us, you know?

33:36.566 --> 33:38.516
I didn't think he'd help...

33:45.323 --> 33:47.325
is everything a game to you?

33:47.725 --> 33:50.127
You can't stop
conning people, can you?

33:50.162 --> 33:52.530
Look, i was a
kid when i had him, brennan.

33:52.565 --> 33:53.696
I had to survive.

33:53.731 --> 33:55.298
What did you expect me to do?

33:55.333 --> 33:58.936
Stop treating everyone
in your life like an easy mark.

33:58.971 --> 34:02.540
I never wanted anyone
to get hurt, least of all you.

34:02.940 --> 34:07.345
You don't understand
how hard it is.

34:07.380 --> 34:10.565
I mean, just the two of us?

34:10.600 --> 34:13.751
You know, you're sick, becky.

34:14.152 --> 34:16.154
Don't talk to her like that.

34:16.188 --> 34:17.320
I'm sorry, connor.

34:17.355 --> 34:18.755
Okay? I'm really, really sorry.

34:18.791 --> 34:20.158
Just leave. Leave us alone.

34:20.193 --> 34:21.724
No.

34:21.759 --> 34:23.360
Okay? Listen, those things are
not going to stop coming

34:23.761 --> 34:24.962
after us until we're all dead.

34:24.996 --> 34:26.563
That's my problem now.

34:26.599 --> 34:27.730
I said go.

34:27.764 --> 34:29.367
Connor, i know
you're hurting, okay?

34:29.402 --> 34:32.170
I know this is painful for you.

34:32.205 --> 34:34.172
I said go! Go.

34:47.385 --> 34:48.985
Get over there.

34:49.021 --> 34:50.188
Come on.

34:57.361 --> 34:58.963
Just give them the disc,
brennan, they'll leave us alone.

34:58.998 --> 35:01.766
It's way too late for that.

35:01.801 --> 35:04.168
Okay... ugh.

35:05.369 --> 35:07.171
Adam, they're back!

35:07.206 --> 35:08.973
Brennan, i know.

35:09.373 --> 35:11.340
Jessie and shalimar
are on their way.

35:11.375 --> 35:13.177
Yeah, what am i supposed
to do in the meantime?

35:13.212 --> 35:14.979
I'm trying to find a
way to block the signals that

35:15.014 --> 35:16.546
control those things.

35:16.581 --> 35:18.583
Well, start flipping
some damned switches.

35:18.618 --> 35:20.950
I'm working on it.

35:20.985 --> 35:22.587
Okay, take connor and
go in the bathroom.

35:22.622 --> 35:23.788
Okay. Come on...
come on, connor.

35:24.188 --> 35:24.989
No, we can't just leave
him here...

35:25.024 --> 35:26.556
no, come on!

35:26.591 --> 35:27.792
I said go in
the bathroom. Come on!

36:02.627 --> 36:03.793
Hey, pal.

36:03.828 --> 36:05.830
Anybody ever
tell you to drop dead?

36:23.848 --> 36:25.449
Come on...

36:29.453 --> 36:31.055
agh...

36:31.090 --> 36:32.657
agh!

36:46.671 --> 36:48.272
Ugh!

36:48.307 --> 36:49.874
Agh!

37:13.898 --> 37:15.900
I've got it.

37:44.729 --> 37:46.731
You okay?

37:47.131 --> 37:48.732
Are you kidding?

37:48.767 --> 37:50.334
That was nothing.

37:57.541 --> 37:59.143
What?

37:59.178 --> 38:00.745
Get up!

38:01.145 --> 38:02.747
Get up!

38:03.547 --> 38:05.114
They're safe.

38:05.149 --> 38:06.315
What about bailey?

38:06.350 --> 38:08.352
Is he just going to walk away?

38:08.753 --> 38:09.954
I don't think so.

38:27.972 --> 38:29.373
Get up.

38:29.408 --> 38:30.775
Get up!

38:33.177 --> 38:35.980
What the hell?

38:44.789 --> 38:47.156
Get back to your stations!

38:47.191 --> 38:49.193
Come on, crank
it up a few notches.

38:49.228 --> 38:51.961
Let's see him really sweat.

38:51.996 --> 38:54.398
Well, as tempting as
that sounds, i think in the

38:54.799 --> 38:56.801
long run i'd rather see him fry.

39:00.805 --> 39:02.406
No!

39:02.441 --> 39:04.008
Stop!

39:08.012 --> 39:10.014
So, your mom and
i were talking about you.

39:10.049 --> 39:12.016
You're trying to
do that father thing again?

39:12.416 --> 39:13.182
Sorry.

39:13.217 --> 39:14.418
Can't help myself.

39:14.819 --> 39:16.385
<whistles> hey.

39:16.420 --> 39:18.622
So your mom's going
to try and go straight, and

39:18.657 --> 39:20.825
i'm counting on you
to make her keep that promise.

39:20.860 --> 39:22.391
Is that my job?

39:22.426 --> 39:24.829
No, your job is to
keep in touch with me, 'cause

39:25.229 --> 39:26.831
whether you like it
or not i'm going to be looking

39:26.866 --> 39:27.997
out for you.

39:28.032 --> 39:29.233
You know you
don't have to do this.

39:29.633 --> 39:30.434
Why?

39:30.835 --> 39:33.237
Because you're not my son?

39:35.639 --> 39:38.442
Like i said,
i can't help myself.

39:38.477 --> 39:39.460
Yeah.

39:39.495 --> 39:40.444
Sure...

39:40.845 --> 39:41.610
whatever.

39:41.645 --> 39:42.847
Yeah, sure... whatever.

39:53.257 --> 39:56.861
I'm sorry i messed up
your life again.

39:56.896 --> 39:58.828
That's okay.

39:58.863 --> 40:02.066
Seems to be what you do best.

40:02.466 --> 40:07.271
Maybe it's time i find
something else i'm good at, huh?

40:07.306 --> 40:10.474
Yeah.

40:10.875 --> 40:15.279
I want you to know that
you were never a mark to me.

40:15.679 --> 40:18.082
You're the only person that...

40:18.482 --> 40:20.885
that i've ever trusted.

40:35.699 --> 40:36.901
Get out of here.

41:05.329 --> 41:06.931
Take care of yourself, okay?

41:06.966 --> 41:08.933
You too.

41:24.949 --> 41:25.749
There he is.

41:25.784 --> 41:27.351
Hey.

41:27.751 --> 41:28.953
For a minute there we
didn't think you were going

41:28.988 --> 41:30.554
to make it.

41:36.160 --> 41:38.527
You okay?

41:38.562 --> 41:41.765
You know, for the
longest time i never ever

41:41.800 --> 41:46.535
imagined even being a father.

41:46.570 --> 41:50.174
And now i can't
imagine not being one.

41:50.574 --> 41:53.377
Connor'll be okay.

41:54.578 --> 41:56.145
Yeah.

41:56.180 --> 41:59.383
Yeah, he's tough.

41:59.418 --> 42:02.586
Just like you.
