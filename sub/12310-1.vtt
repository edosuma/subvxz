00:04.360 --> 00:09.270
The heavens themselves,
the planets and this earth

00:09.320 --> 00:12.910
Observe degree, priority and place,

00:12.960 --> 00:18.270
Office and custom, in all line of order

00:18.320 --> 00:23.070
Take but degree away, untune that string,

00:23.120 --> 00:28.600

02:06.320 --> 02:10.919
King Henry the Fifth,
too famous to live long!

02:12.400 --> 02:16.270
England ne'er lost a
king of so much worth.

02:16.320 --> 02:19.520
England ne'er had a king until his time.

02:20.440 --> 02:24.640
His sparkling eyes, replete
with wrathful fire,

02:26.080 --> 02:29.230
More dazzled and drove back his enemies

02:29.280 --> 02:34.240
Than mid-day sun fierce
bent against their faces.

02:36.240 --> 02:39.590
Henry the Fifth, thy ghost I invocate:

02:39.640 --> 02:43.390
Prosper this realm, keep
it from civil broils,

02:43.440 --> 02:46.830
Combat with adverse
planets in the heavens!

02:46.880 --> 02:50.190
A far more glorious
star thy soul will make

02:50.240 --> 02:52.910
Than Julius Caesar or bright...

02:54.400 --> 02:57.110
My honourable lords,

02:57.160 --> 03:00.270
Sad tidings bring I to you out of France,

03:00.320 --> 03:05.310
Of loss, of slaughter and discomfiture:

03:05.360 --> 03:07.470
Paris, Guysors, Poitiers,
are all quite lost.

03:07.520 --> 03:09.710
What say'st thou, man,
before dead Henry's corse?

03:09.760 --> 03:12.270
Speak softly, or the
loss of those great towns

03:12.320 --> 03:15.230
Will make him burst his
lead and rise from death.

03:15.280 --> 03:19.990
Is Paris lost? Is Guysors yielded up?

03:20.040 --> 03:22.230
If Henry were recall'd to life again,

03:22.280 --> 03:25.590
These news would cause him
once more yield the ghost.

03:25.640 --> 03:28.550
How were they lost?
What treachery was used?

03:28.600 --> 03:31.720
No treachery; but want of men and money.

03:32.840 --> 03:35.670
Of England's coat one half is cut away.

03:35.720 --> 03:37.830
Were our tears wanting to this funeral,

03:37.880 --> 03:40.350
These tidings would call
forth their flowing tides.

03:40.400 --> 03:42.990
Give me my steeled coat.
I'll fight for France.

03:43.040 --> 03:45.110
Wounds will I lend the
French instead of eyes,

03:45.160 --> 03:48.830
- To weep their intermissive miseries.
- O, whither shall we fly from this reproach?

03:48.880 --> 03:51.030
We will not fly, but
to our enemies' throats.

03:51.080 --> 03:53.190
Exeter, if thou be
slack, I'll fight it out.

03:53.240 --> 03:55.390
Gloucester, why doubt'st
thou of my forwardness?

03:55.440 --> 03:57.550
An army have I muster'd in my thoughts,

03:57.600 --> 03:59.870
Wherewith already France is overrun.

03:59.920 --> 04:02.910
My gracious lord, to add to your laments,

04:02.960 --> 04:06.660
Wherewith you now be
due King Henry's hearse.

04:07.280 --> 04:10.880
'I must inform you of
a fight for Orleans...

04:11.080 --> 04:14.360
'Betwixt the stout lords
Talbot and Salisbury...

04:16.120 --> 04:18.190
'.. and the French.'

04:19.880 --> 04:21.420
Salisbury!

04:27.280 --> 04:30.560
'The camp, by night was overrun.'

04:31.840 --> 04:33.230
Talbot slain?

04:33.280 --> 04:35.470
No, Talbot lives

04:35.520 --> 04:38.030
but forced to flee Orleans.

04:38.080 --> 04:40.590
Farewell, my masters.

04:40.640 --> 04:43.750
Bonfires in France forthwith I am to make,

04:43.800 --> 04:46.310
To warm our great Saint George's feast.

04:46.360 --> 04:48.430
I'll either quell the Dauphin utterly,

04:48.480 --> 04:51.670
Or bring him in obedience
to our yoke. Come.

04:51.720 --> 04:55.030
I'll to the Tower with
all the haste I can,

04:55.080 --> 04:58.680
And there, I will
proclaim young Henry king.

05:48.880 --> 05:50.620
Your Majesty.

06:24.040 --> 06:27.470
My lord, your loving nephew.

06:27.520 --> 06:30.270
Richard Plantagenet, is he come?

06:30.320 --> 06:33.550
Aye, noble uncle.

06:33.600 --> 06:35.510
Your nephew, Richard, comes.

06:35.560 --> 06:37.030
Direct mine arms.

06:37.080 --> 06:39.350
I may embrace his neck.

06:48.560 --> 06:50.190
Poor gentleman!

06:50.240 --> 06:52.230
Your wrong doth equal mine.

06:52.280 --> 06:55.960
Deprived of honour and inheritance.

06:57.480 --> 07:00.470
But now the arbitrator of despairs.

07:00.520 --> 07:02.320
Just death.

07:03.960 --> 07:06.840
Kind umpire of men's miseries,

07:08.320 --> 07:12.830
With sweet enlargements
doth dismiss me hence:

07:12.880 --> 07:15.790
I would his troubles were expired,

07:15.840 --> 07:19.910
That you might recover what is lost.

07:19.960 --> 07:22.550
Good uncle,

07:22.600 --> 07:25.990
for my father's sake, In
honour of a true Plantagenet,

07:26.040 --> 07:29.040
For alliance sake, declare the cause.

07:32.360 --> 07:36.640
Henry the Fourth, grandfather
to the young king,

07:37.960 --> 07:41.190
Deposed his true king Richard,

07:41.240 --> 07:44.950
I should have been the
rightful next by birth.

07:45.000 --> 07:48.240
When my friends opposed this usurpment

07:49.760 --> 07:53.000
And worked to instate me the rightful heir

07:55.360 --> 07:59.670
I lost my liberty and they their lives.

07:59.720 --> 08:02.120
Are you the rightful king?

08:03.080 --> 08:05.510
And I thy heir?

08:05.560 --> 08:08.510
With silence, nephew, be thou politic:

08:08.560 --> 08:11.750
Strong-fixed is the house of Lancaster,

08:11.800 --> 08:14.230
And like a mountain,

08:14.280 --> 08:16.480
not to be removed.

08:19.080 --> 08:20.630
And so,

08:20.680 --> 08:22.270
farewell.

08:22.320 --> 08:25.230
And fair be all thy hopes

08:25.280 --> 08:28.190
And prosperous be thy life

08:28.240 --> 08:30.040
in peace and...

08:30.680 --> 08:32.110
.. war.

08:45.600 --> 08:50.080
Here dies the dusky torch of Mortimer.

08:54.320 --> 08:57.030
And now, for all those wrongs,

08:57.080 --> 08:59.550
those bitter injuries,

08:59.600 --> 09:03.880
Which too long Fate
hath offer'd to my house:

09:06.320 --> 09:10.680
I silently swear with honour to redress.

09:23.880 --> 09:26.110
My great uncle was Edmund Mortimer.

09:26.160 --> 09:30.470
Who married Philippa, sole daughter
unto Lionel, Duke of Clarence.

09:30.520 --> 09:34.560
Therefore, so if the issue of the
elder son succeed the younger...

09:36.240 --> 09:37.980
.. I am king.

09:42.320 --> 09:44.710
The truth appears so naked on my side

09:44.760 --> 09:48.260
that any poor, blind
eye could seek it out.

09:52.600 --> 09:55.710
Since you are tongue-tied
and so loathe to speak,

09:55.760 --> 09:58.710
Let him that is a true-born gentleman,

09:58.760 --> 10:02.060
Does he suppose that I have pleaded truth?

10:02.440 --> 10:04.980
From off this briar pluck...

10:06.520 --> 10:09.390
.. a white rose with me.

10:09.440 --> 10:11.980
Let him that is no coward...

10:12.840 --> 10:14.310
.. nor no flatterer,

10:14.360 --> 10:17.880
Pluck a red rose from
off this thorn with me.

10:18.920 --> 10:21.590
I love no colours, and without all colour

10:21.640 --> 10:24.230
Of base insinuating flattery

10:24.280 --> 10:25.830
I pluck this...

10:25.880 --> 10:28.220
white rose with my lord.

10:33.240 --> 10:36.230
I pluck this red rose with brave Somerset

10:36.280 --> 10:38.950
And say withal I think he held the right.

10:39.000 --> 10:41.710
Stay, lords and gentlemen,
and pluck no more,

10:41.760 --> 10:44.870
Till you conclude that he upon whose side

10:44.920 --> 10:47.670
The fewest roses are cropp'd from the tree

10:47.720 --> 10:51.430
Shall yield the other
in the right opinion.

10:51.480 --> 10:53.430
Good Lord of Warwick, it is well objected:

10:53.480 --> 10:56.480
If I have fewest, I subscribe in silence.

10:57.600 --> 10:58.940
And I.

11:01.240 --> 11:02.550
Then

11:02.600 --> 11:04.150
for the truth

11:04.200 --> 11:07.320
and plainness of the case.

11:12.400 --> 11:14.870
I pluck this pale and maiden blossom here,

11:14.920 --> 11:18.870
Giving my verdict on the white rose side.

11:18.920 --> 11:20.670
Well, well...

11:20.720 --> 11:22.720
Come on! Who else?

11:26.800 --> 11:28.990
Now, Somerset, where is your argument?

11:29.040 --> 11:31.390
Here in my scabbard, meditating that

11:31.440 --> 11:33.950
Shall dye your white rose in a bloody red.

11:34.000 --> 11:35.670
Meantime

11:35.720 --> 11:38.590
your cheeks do counterfeit our roses,

11:38.640 --> 11:41.510
- For pale they look with fear.
- Not for fear

11:41.560 --> 11:44.870
but anger that thy tongue
will not confess thy error.

11:44.920 --> 11:47.670
Proud fool, begone!

11:47.720 --> 11:49.830
I scorn both him and thee.

11:49.880 --> 11:53.180
Turn not thy scorns this way, Plantagenet.

11:53.560 --> 11:55.710
I'll turn my dagger here into thy throat.

11:55.760 --> 11:57.070
Let us away, good Suffolk

11:57.120 --> 12:00.720
We grace this yeoman
by conversing with him.

12:01.680 --> 12:03.790
Now, by God's will!

12:03.840 --> 12:05.630
Thou wrong'st him, Somerset.

12:05.680 --> 12:08.350
Was not thy father for treason executed?

12:08.400 --> 12:11.390
His trespass yet lives
guilty in thy blood;

12:11.440 --> 12:13.510
And, till thou be restored,
thou art a yeoman.

12:13.560 --> 12:15.900
My father was no traitor!

12:17.280 --> 12:19.750
And that I'll prove on
better men than Somerset,

12:19.800 --> 12:21.550
and scourge you for this apprehension:

12:21.600 --> 12:23.630
Look to it well,

12:23.680 --> 12:25.510
say you were well warn'd.

12:25.560 --> 12:28.470
Thou shalt find us ready for thee still,

12:28.520 --> 12:32.150
And know us by these colours for thy foes,

12:32.200 --> 12:36.350
For these my friends in
spite of thee shall wear.

12:36.400 --> 12:41.310
And, by my soul, this pale and angry rose,

12:41.360 --> 12:44.840
A symbol, white, of my
blood-drinking hate,

12:46.520 --> 12:48.520
Shall I for ever..

12:49.120 --> 12:51.470
.. and my faction wear.

12:51.520 --> 12:54.720
Go forward and be choked
with thy ambition.

13:24.880 --> 13:26.800
Oh!

13:28.360 --> 13:30.520
Gloucester?

13:38.040 --> 13:41.110
Comest thou with deep premeditated lines,

13:41.160 --> 13:46.870
With written pamphlets studiously
devised? Humphrey of Gloucester,

13:46.920 --> 13:48.790
If thou canst accuse,

13:48.840 --> 13:51.110
Do it without invention, suddenly,

13:51.160 --> 13:53.470
As I with sudden and extemporal speech

13:53.520 --> 13:56.820
Purpose to answer what thou canst object.

13:57.320 --> 13:59.060
Your Majesty.

13:59.960 --> 14:02.030
Presumptuous priest!

14:02.080 --> 14:03.910
This place commands my patience,

14:03.960 --> 14:06.510
Or thou shouldst find
thou hast dishonour'd me.

14:06.560 --> 14:09.630
Thou art a most pernicious usurer,

14:09.680 --> 14:12.790
Forward by nature, enemy to peace...

14:12.840 --> 14:15.430
Lascivious, wanton, more than well beseems

14:15.480 --> 14:17.590
A man of thy profession and degree.

14:17.640 --> 14:20.350
Beside, I fear me, if thy
thoughts were sifted,

14:20.400 --> 14:23.470
The King, thy sovereign,
is not quite exempt

14:23.520 --> 14:26.670
From envious malice of thy swelling heart.

14:28.600 --> 14:30.230
Gloucester, I do defy thee.

14:30.280 --> 14:32.310
If I were

14:32.360 --> 14:35.430
covetous, ambitious or perverse,

14:35.480 --> 14:38.480
As he would have me, how am I so poor?

14:39.040 --> 14:42.310
It is not that that
hath incensed the duke:

14:42.360 --> 14:46.150
It is because no-one should sway but he,

14:46.200 --> 14:49.310
No-one but he should be about the King,

14:49.360 --> 14:51.790
And that engenders thunder in his breast

14:51.840 --> 14:54.270
And makes him roar these
accusations forth.

14:54.320 --> 14:58.070
- Am I not Protector, saucy priest?
- Unreverent Gloucester!

14:58.120 --> 15:00.750
Thou art reverent Touching
thy spiritual function,

15:00.800 --> 15:01.950
not thy life.

15:02.000 --> 15:05.800
- Rome shall remedy this!
- Roam thither, then.

15:09.520 --> 15:11.790
Uncles of Gloucester and of Winchester,

15:11.840 --> 15:15.550
I would prevail, if prayers might prevail,

15:15.600 --> 15:19.920
To join your hearts in love and amity.

15:21.360 --> 15:24.710
O, what a scandal is it to our crown,

15:24.760 --> 15:29.640
That two such noble
peers as ye should jar!

15:31.240 --> 15:33.310
Believe me, lords,

15:33.360 --> 15:35.990
my tender years can tell

15:36.040 --> 15:39.350
Civil dissension is a viperous worm

15:39.400 --> 15:42.560
That gnaws the bowels of the commonwealth.

15:44.040 --> 15:46.390
How this discord doth afflict my soul!

15:46.440 --> 15:49.430
Can you, my Lord of Winchester, behold

15:49.480 --> 15:52.800
My sighs and tears and
will not once relent?

15:54.000 --> 15:57.190
Who should study to prefer a peace?

15:57.240 --> 16:01.150
If holy churchmen take delight in broils?

16:01.200 --> 16:05.430
Yield, my Lord Protector,
yield, Winchester.

16:05.480 --> 16:08.230
He shall submit, or I will never yield.

16:08.280 --> 16:11.580
Compassion on the King commands me stoop.

16:13.800 --> 16:15.990
Behold, my Lord of Winchester,

16:16.040 --> 16:19.750
the Duke hath banish'd
moody, discontented fury.

16:19.800 --> 16:23.190
Why look you still so stern and tragical?

16:23.240 --> 16:26.340
Here, Winchester, I offer thee my hand.

16:31.360 --> 16:34.200
Fie, holy uncle!

16:35.360 --> 16:36.790
I have heard you preach

16:36.840 --> 16:39.880
That malice is a great and grievous sin.

16:41.160 --> 16:44.320
And will not you maintain
the thing you teach?

16:47.480 --> 16:51.310
Well, Duke of Gloucester,
I will yield to thee.

16:55.360 --> 16:58.270
O, loving uncle, kind Duke of Gloucester,

16:58.320 --> 17:02.000
How joyful am I made by this contract!

17:03.920 --> 17:07.630
Accept this appeal, Gracious Sovereign,

17:07.680 --> 17:10.980
And hear the right of Richard Plantagenet.

17:17.640 --> 17:21.150
Well urged, my Lord of
Warwick: for, sweet prince,

17:21.200 --> 17:24.270
You have great reason to do Richard right.

17:24.319 --> 17:26.710
My loving lords, our pleasure is

17:26.760 --> 17:29.760
That Richard be restored to his blood.

17:32.120 --> 17:34.910
Thy humble servant vows obedience

17:34.960 --> 17:38.950
And humble service till
the point of death.

17:39.000 --> 17:42.600
Stoop then and set thy
knee against my foot.

17:46.680 --> 17:50.360
And, in return of that duty done,

17:51.680 --> 17:56.000
I gird thee with the
valiant sword of York.

17:57.240 --> 18:01.110
Rise Richard, like a true Plantagenet,

18:01.160 --> 18:05.390
And rise created princely Duke of York.

18:05.440 --> 18:07.780
And so thrive Richard...

18:08.920 --> 18:11.710
And so perish they

18:11.760 --> 18:14.800
That grudge one thought
against Your Majesty.

18:17.680 --> 18:19.950
Welcome, high prince,

18:20.000 --> 18:22.470
mighty Duke of York!

18:26.080 --> 18:29.590
Perish, base prince,
ignoble Duke of York(!)

18:29.640 --> 18:31.830
Now will it best avail Your Majesty

18:31.880 --> 18:34.830
To cross the seas and
to be crown'd in France:

18:34.880 --> 18:37.430
The presence of a king engenders love

18:37.480 --> 18:39.390
Amongst his subjects
and his loyal friends,

18:39.440 --> 18:41.270
As it disanimates his enemies.

18:41.320 --> 18:44.710
When Gloucester says the
word, King Henry goes,

18:44.760 --> 18:48.630
For friendly counsel cuts off many foes.

18:48.680 --> 18:51.620
Your ships already are in readiness!

19:39.040 --> 19:43.070
God save King Henry of
England and of France.

19:43.120 --> 19:44.870
Of that name, the sixth.

19:44.920 --> 19:46.920
God save the King.

19:52.880 --> 19:54.590
My gracious sovereign,

19:54.640 --> 19:56.870
as we rode from Calais,

19:56.920 --> 19:59.270
in haste unto your coronation,

19:59.320 --> 20:01.470
A letter was deliver'd to my hands,

20:01.520 --> 20:05.220
Writ to Your Grace from
the Dauphin of France.

20:09.120 --> 20:11.190
My Lord Protector...

20:12.080 --> 20:14.150
.. view the letter.

20:15.240 --> 20:17.280
"To the King"...!

20:18.400 --> 20:21.340
Hath he forgot he is his sovereign?

20:21.880 --> 20:24.190
"I have, upon especial cause,

20:24.240 --> 20:26.950
"Moved with compassion
of my country's wrack,

20:27.000 --> 20:30.590
"Led by one Joan La Pucelle

20:30.640 --> 20:34.550
"taken back the town of Rouen lost.

20:34.600 --> 20:37.230
"Thrown out your lordships occupying there

20:37.280 --> 20:39.510
"and am hailed by my people..."

20:39.560 --> 20:42.790
".. Charles, the rightful King of France."

20:42.840 --> 20:44.550
O monstrous treachery!

20:44.600 --> 20:47.550
Doth France... revolt?

20:47.600 --> 20:50.920
It doth, my lord, and is become your foe.

20:57.040 --> 21:01.750
Now then, Lord Talbot,
you must return to Charles

21:01.800 --> 21:05.230
And give him chastisement for this abuse.

21:05.280 --> 21:08.630
How say you, my lord? Are you content?

21:08.680 --> 21:10.550
Content, my liege.

21:10.600 --> 21:12.910
I should have begg'd I
might have been employ'd.

21:12.960 --> 21:15.510
Then gather strength from
these assembled here. Somerset!

21:15.560 --> 21:18.390
- You have scores of horsemen, have you not?
- I have, my lord.

21:18.440 --> 21:21.070
Will you help good Talbot curb the French?

21:21.120 --> 21:23.190
I swear I shall supply him what he needs.

21:23.240 --> 21:25.030
Now...

21:25.080 --> 21:28.310
with full power, march
unto Charles, straight.

21:28.360 --> 21:31.670
Let him perceive how
ill we brook his treason

21:31.720 --> 21:35.630
- and what offence it is to
flout a friend. - I go, my lord.

21:35.680 --> 21:37.190
In heart desiring still

21:37.240 --> 21:39.790
You may behold confusion

21:39.840 --> 21:41.680
of your foes.

21:45.600 --> 21:48.550
Lord Somerset and York.

21:48.600 --> 21:50.670
I pray, come hither.

21:58.040 --> 22:01.400
I see no reason, if I wear this rose,

22:02.720 --> 22:04.750
That any one should
therefore be suspicious

22:04.800 --> 22:07.270
I more incline to Somerset than York:

22:07.320 --> 22:10.600
Both are my kinsmen, and I love them both.

22:11.960 --> 22:14.710
As we hither came in peace,

22:14.760 --> 22:18.670
So let us still continue peace...

22:18.720 --> 22:20.190
and love.

22:26.160 --> 22:28.100
Cousin of York...

22:29.600 --> 22:31.110
.. we institute Your Grace

22:31.160 --> 22:34.460
To be our regent in these parts of France.

22:34.960 --> 22:37.790
And, good my Lord of Somerset,

22:37.840 --> 22:40.950
Unite your troops of horsemen
with his bands of foot,

22:41.000 --> 22:44.590
And, like true subjects,

22:44.640 --> 22:48.750
Both follow Talbot and
our valiant uncle Exeter

22:48.800 --> 22:51.870
Back to Rouen and to
this traitor, Charles.

22:51.920 --> 22:54.520
Go cheerfully together...

22:55.720 --> 22:59.520
.. and digest Your angry
choler on your enemies.

23:16.040 --> 23:19.140
Prettily, the King did play the orator.

23:19.640 --> 23:22.750
And so he did, but yet I like it not,

23:22.800 --> 23:24.670
he wears the badge of Somerset.

23:24.720 --> 23:27.030
Shush, but his fancy, blame him not.

23:27.080 --> 23:29.910
I dare presume, sweet prince,

23:29.960 --> 23:31.790
he thought no harm.

23:31.840 --> 23:34.270
But let it rest.

23:34.320 --> 23:37.190
Other affairs must now be managed.

23:41.160 --> 23:44.360
Well didst Richard of
York suppress his voice.

23:48.040 --> 23:51.740
For, had the passions
of his heart burst out,

23:52.440 --> 23:55.150
I fear we should have
seen decipher'd there

23:55.200 --> 23:57.150
More rancorous spite,

23:57.200 --> 23:59.550
more furious raging broils,

23:59.600 --> 24:02.600
Than yet can be imagined or supposed.

24:05.360 --> 24:08.630
'Tis much when sceptres
are in children's hands,

24:08.680 --> 24:11.200
But more when envy...

24:12.560 --> 24:14.430
.. breeds unkind division.

24:14.480 --> 24:16.620
There comes the rain.

24:18.480 --> 24:20.750
There begins confusion.

24:44.880 --> 24:46.440
'Joan...'

24:47.520 --> 24:48.880
Joan!

24:53.360 --> 24:55.270
Joan...

25:00.760 --> 25:02.200
Joan!

25:11.000 --> 25:13.160
Look on thy country,

25:14.600 --> 25:17.000
Look on fertile France,

25:18.120 --> 25:20.590
And see the cities

25:20.640 --> 25:22.710
and the towns defaced

25:22.760 --> 25:25.560
By wasting ruin of the cruel foe!

25:26.840 --> 25:30.340
Wee little herd of
England's timorous deer,

25:30.480 --> 25:33.590
Mazed with a yelping
kennel of French curs!

25:35.520 --> 25:37.710
If we be English deer,

25:37.760 --> 25:39.470
be then in blood,

25:39.520 --> 25:43.350
Not rascal-like, to
fall down with a pinch,

25:43.400 --> 25:46.830
But rather, moody-mad, desperate stags!

25:46.880 --> 25:49.630
Good men! I am, by birth,
a shepherd's daughter

25:49.680 --> 25:52.550
My wit untrained in any kind of art.

25:52.600 --> 25:55.270
Turn on the bloody
hounds with heads of steel

25:55.320 --> 25:57.870
And make the cowards stand aloof at bay.

25:57.920 --> 26:00.470
Whilst I prayed unto the holy lamp,

26:00.520 --> 26:02.910
God's mother deigned to appear to me

26:02.960 --> 26:05.830
And in a vision full of majesty

26:05.880 --> 26:08.550
Will'd me to leave my base vocation

26:08.600 --> 26:11.390
And free my country from calamity!

26:11.440 --> 26:15.510
God and Saint George,
Talbot and England's right,

26:15.560 --> 26:19.160
Prosper our colours in
this dangerous fight!

27:20.840 --> 27:22.470
Lord Somerset?

27:22.520 --> 27:23.950
There.

28:21.920 --> 28:24.470
How now, Sir William!
Whither were you sent?

28:24.520 --> 28:26.630
Whither, Somerset?

28:26.680 --> 28:29.830
from bought and sold Lord Talbot,

28:29.880 --> 28:32.350
Who, ring'd about with bold adversity,

28:32.400 --> 28:35.310
Cries out for noble
Somerset's promised horse.

28:35.360 --> 28:37.070
Say, will you send your troops?

28:37.120 --> 28:40.120
It's too late. I cannot send them now.

28:40.640 --> 28:45.550
This expedition was, by York
and Talbot, too rashly plotted.

28:45.600 --> 28:46.910
The over-daring Talbot

28:46.960 --> 28:50.590
Hath sullied all his gloss of former glory

28:50.640 --> 28:55.350
By this unheedful,
desperate, wild adventure.

28:55.400 --> 28:57.310
York set him on. York
should provide him aid.

28:57.360 --> 28:59.790
And York as fast upon Your Grace exclaims,

28:59.840 --> 29:03.120
- Swearing that you withhold
your promised aid. - York lies.

29:05.240 --> 29:07.110
He might have sent and had the horse.

29:07.160 --> 29:10.160
I owe him little duty, and less love.

29:11.840 --> 29:14.470
The fraud of England,
not the force of France,

29:14.520 --> 29:17.670
Hath now entrapp'd the
noble-minded Talbot:

29:17.720 --> 29:21.560
He dies, betray'd to
fortune by your strife.

29:23.040 --> 29:25.350
'And on his son, young John,

29:25.400 --> 29:28.830
'Of whom, two hours since, news did arrive

29:28.880 --> 29:32.240
'That he is speeding
to his warlike father.'

29:35.800 --> 29:37.670
Come, go.

29:37.720 --> 29:39.950
I will dispatch the horsemen straight.

29:40.000 --> 29:42.990
Within six hours, they will be at his aid.

29:43.040 --> 29:46.110
Too late comes rescue:
he is ta'en or slain.

29:46.160 --> 29:48.030
If he be dead...

29:49.600 --> 29:51.910
.. brave Talbot, then adieu!

29:51.960 --> 29:54.390
His fame lives in the world,

29:54.440 --> 29:57.360
his shame in you.

30:19.160 --> 30:21.550
Father!

30:21.600 --> 30:23.120
John!

30:28.600 --> 30:29.830
John, I did send for thee.

30:29.880 --> 30:31.950
That Talbot's name might
be in thee revived

30:32.000 --> 30:34.790
Now thou art come unto a feast of death,

30:34.840 --> 30:36.750
A terrible and unavoided danger.

30:36.800 --> 30:39.270
Therefore, dear boy, mount
on my swiftest horse,

30:39.320 --> 30:41.350
And I'll direct thee how thou shalt escape

30:41.400 --> 30:44.900
By sudden flight. Come,
dally not, be gone.

30:45.120 --> 30:48.270
Is my name Talbot? And am I your son?

30:48.320 --> 30:50.190
And shall I fly?

30:50.880 --> 30:53.990
O, if you love my mother,
Dishonour not her name,

30:54.040 --> 30:56.670
To make a bastard and a slave of me!

30:56.720 --> 30:59.070
You fly, to revenge my
death, if I be slain!

30:59.120 --> 31:01.510
He that flies so will ne'er return again.

31:01.560 --> 31:03.560
If we both stay...

31:04.600 --> 31:05.870
.. we both are sure to die.

31:05.920 --> 31:09.220
Then let me stay, and, Father, do you fly.

31:10.680 --> 31:13.390
Here on my knee I beg mortality,

31:13.440 --> 31:16.390
Rather than life preserved with infamy.

31:16.440 --> 31:18.590
Upon my blessing, I command thee, GO!

31:18.640 --> 31:21.430
To fight I will, but not to fly the foe.

31:21.480 --> 31:25.190
Stay, go, do what you will, the like do I,

31:25.240 --> 31:29.560
For live I will not, if my father die.

31:34.440 --> 31:36.720
Come, side by side...

31:38.000 --> 31:39.790
.. together live and die.

31:39.840 --> 31:43.540
And soul with soul from
France to heaven fly.

32:01.160 --> 32:02.990
Argh!

32:20.560 --> 32:22.760
Where is young Talbot?

32:25.520 --> 32:27.720
Where is valiant John?

32:29.360 --> 32:31.630
Where is my other life?

32:48.280 --> 32:50.440
No...

32:57.800 --> 32:59.400
No, John...

33:00.800 --> 33:02.800
Dizzy-eyed fury...

33:03.200 --> 33:05.550
.. and great rage of heart

33:05.600 --> 33:08.440
Suddenly made thou from my side

33:09.440 --> 33:12.880
To start into the clustering
battle of the French.

33:16.240 --> 33:17.910
And there...

33:19.400 --> 33:21.800
.. in that sea of blood...

33:23.160 --> 33:26.240
.. my boy did drench His
over-mounting spirit.

33:29.440 --> 33:31.750
And there died my Icarus,

33:31.800 --> 33:33.540
my blossom...

33:35.560 --> 33:37.430
.. in his pride.

33:49.320 --> 33:51.590
Had York and Somerset brought rescue in,

33:51.640 --> 33:53.910
We should have found a bloody day of this.

33:53.960 --> 33:57.710
Hew them to pieces,
hack their bones asunder

33:57.760 --> 34:01.390
Whose life was England's
glory, Gallia's wonder.

34:01.440 --> 34:03.990
O, no, forbear! For
that which we have fled

34:04.040 --> 34:06.830
During the life, let us not wrong it dead.

34:06.880 --> 34:08.830
<Where is the dauphin?

34:08.880 --> 34:13.110
The day is ours, base wretches.

34:13.159 --> 34:16.550
Thy forces are overwhelm'd
by God and France.

34:16.600 --> 34:19.270
Who art thou, devil?

34:19.320 --> 34:21.469
Where's the great Alcides of the field,

34:21.520 --> 34:24.920
Valiant Lord Talbot, Earl of Shrewsbury?

34:27.880 --> 34:30.909
O, were mine eyeballs into bullets turn'd,

34:30.960 --> 34:35.070
That I in rage might
shoot them in your faces!

34:35.120 --> 34:37.630
Go, take their bodies hence.

34:37.679 --> 34:40.020
We will bear them hence.

35:05.520 --> 35:09.150
O, that we could call the dead to life!

35:09.200 --> 35:12.800
It would enough to fright
the realm of France.

35:45.280 --> 35:48.840
The English army, that
divided was into two parties,

35:50.680 --> 35:52.750
Must now conjoin...

35:53.760 --> 35:55.520
.. in one.

36:21.160 --> 36:24.150
From Talbot's sacred ashes shall be rear'd

36:24.200 --> 36:27.400
A phoenix that will
make all France afeared.

36:45.560 --> 36:46.900
Again!

37:09.640 --> 37:11.580
'Joan... Joan...'

37:14.640 --> 37:16.040
'Joan?'

37:20.600 --> 37:22.510
'Joan?'

37:28.840 --> 37:31.240
Ave Maria, gratia plena...

37:34.880 --> 37:37.280
Ave Maria, gratia plena...

39:04.080 --> 39:05.950
Fairest woman...

39:06.800 --> 39:08.540
Do not fear...

39:09.200 --> 39:10.310
.. nor fly.

39:10.360 --> 39:13.150
For I will touch thee
but with reverent hands.

39:13.200 --> 39:15.230
I kiss these fingers

39:15.280 --> 39:17.360
for eternal peace,

39:21.080 --> 39:24.180
And lay them gently at thy tender side.

39:33.840 --> 39:35.580
Who art thou?

39:36.440 --> 39:38.980
Say, that I may honour thee.

39:39.240 --> 39:41.110
Margaret my name

39:42.040 --> 39:44.110
And daughter to a duke,

39:44.160 --> 39:47.160
The Duke of Anjou, whosoe'er thou art.

39:51.920 --> 39:53.660
An earl I am,

39:55.240 --> 39:57.590
And Somerset am call'd.

39:57.640 --> 40:01.070
Say, Somerset, if thy name be so...

40:01.120 --> 40:04.190
What ransom must I pay before I pass?

40:04.240 --> 40:07.360
For I perceive I am thy prisoner.

40:11.160 --> 40:13.070
Why speak'st thou not?

40:13.120 --> 40:16.430
What ransom must I pay?

40:16.480 --> 40:18.870
Gentle princess, would you not suppose

40:18.920 --> 40:21.560
Your bondage... happy

40:22.840 --> 40:24.110
To be made a queen?

40:24.160 --> 40:28.350
To be a queen in bondage is more vile

40:28.400 --> 40:31.230
Than is a slave in base servility,

40:31.280 --> 40:33.470
For princes should be free.

40:33.520 --> 40:35.460
And so shall you,

40:36.360 --> 40:39.310
If happy England's royal king be free.

40:39.360 --> 40:40.840
Why?

40:42.080 --> 40:43.990
What concerns his freedom unto me?

40:44.040 --> 40:47.280
I'll undertake to make thee Henry's queen,

40:48.320 --> 40:50.750
To put a precious crown upon thy head,

40:50.800 --> 40:53.840
- If thou wilt condescend
to be my... - What?

40:55.480 --> 40:57.120
HIS love.

41:02.800 --> 41:05.110
I am unworthy to be Henry's wife.

41:05.160 --> 41:08.070
No, gentle madam, I unworthy am

41:08.120 --> 41:10.460
To woo so fair a dame...

41:12.160 --> 41:14.160
.. to be his wife.

41:17.200 --> 41:19.870
How say you, madam, are ye so content?

41:19.920 --> 41:21.360
Um...

41:22.680 --> 41:24.880
If my father please...

41:26.200 --> 41:28.070
.. I am content.

41:30.840 --> 41:32.310
Then,

41:32.360 --> 41:33.830
madam...

41:35.320 --> 41:36.950
At your father's castle walls

41:37.000 --> 41:39.270
We'll crave a parley...

41:39.360 --> 41:41.560
.. to confer with him.

41:42.520 --> 41:44.860
'Where art thou, witch?'

41:53.640 --> 41:55.910
Damsel of France.

41:55.960 --> 41:58.070
I think I have you first.

41:58.120 --> 42:01.510
A plaguing mischief light on thee!

42:01.560 --> 42:04.910
And may ye be suddenly surprised

42:04.960 --> 42:08.950
By bloody hands, in sleeping on your bed!

42:09.000 --> 42:13.590
Fell banning hag,
enchantress, hold thy tongue!

42:13.640 --> 42:16.990
I prithee, give me leave to curse awhile!

42:19.040 --> 42:22.590
Curse, miscreant, when
thou comest to the stake.

42:42.240 --> 42:44.920
See, Anjou...

42:45.960 --> 42:47.670
See, thy daughter prisoner!

42:47.720 --> 42:49.030
What remedy?

42:49.080 --> 42:51.990
I am a soldier, and unapt to weep,

42:52.040 --> 42:55.680
Or to exclaim on Fortune's fickleness.

42:57.040 --> 42:59.830
There is remedy enough, my lord.

42:59.880 --> 43:02.270
Consent, and for thy honour give consent,

43:02.320 --> 43:04.510
Thy daughter shall be wedded to my king.

43:04.560 --> 43:07.670
Her I with pain have
woo'd and won thereto,

43:07.720 --> 43:09.990
And this her easy-held imprisonment

43:10.040 --> 43:13.340
Hath gained thy daughter princely liberty.

43:14.360 --> 43:16.630
Speaks he as he thinks?

43:18.920 --> 43:21.350
Fair Margaret knows the Earl of Somerset

43:21.400 --> 43:23.870
Doth not flatter nor feign.

43:25.520 --> 43:30.230
Welcome, brave earl, into our territories.

43:30.280 --> 43:33.580
Command to Anjou what your honour pleases.

43:35.640 --> 43:37.380
Thanks, Anjou,

43:38.240 --> 43:40.270
Happy for so sweet a child,

43:40.320 --> 43:43.030
For to be made companion to a king.

43:43.080 --> 43:45.630
What answer makes Your Grace unto my suit?

43:45.680 --> 43:48.350
Since thou dost deign
to woo her little worth

43:48.400 --> 43:51.600
To be the princely bride of such a lord,

43:52.680 --> 43:54.950
Upon condition I may quietly

43:55.000 --> 43:59.280
Enjoy mine own, the
country Maine and Anjou,

44:00.400 --> 44:03.900
My daughter shall be
Henry's, if he please.

44:09.440 --> 44:11.510
That is her ransom.

44:12.040 --> 44:13.190
I deliver her,

44:13.240 --> 44:15.030
And those two counties I will undertake

44:15.080 --> 44:18.280
Your Grace shall well and quietly enjoy.

44:19.200 --> 44:22.320
And I again, in Henry's royal name,

44:23.800 --> 44:26.430
Give thee her hand,

44:26.480 --> 44:28.950
for sign of plighted faith.

44:30.040 --> 44:32.190
Anjou of France, I give
thee kingly thanks,

44:32.240 --> 44:34.270
For this is in traffic of a king.

44:34.320 --> 44:36.190
I'll over then to England with this news,

44:36.240 --> 44:39.430
And make this marriage to be solemnised.

44:39.480 --> 44:41.550
So farewell, Anjou.

44:41.640 --> 44:43.590
I'll set this diamond safe

44:43.640 --> 44:46.350
In golden palaces, as it becomes.

44:46.400 --> 44:48.710
I do embrace thee, as I would embrace

44:48.760 --> 44:51.510
The Christian Prince, King Henry,

44:51.560 --> 44:53.300
were he here.

45:19.720 --> 45:21.790
Farewell, my lord...

45:23.680 --> 45:25.950
.. good wishes, praise and prayers

45:26.000 --> 45:29.000
Shall Somerset ever have of Margaret.

45:30.240 --> 45:33.430
Farewell, sweet madam...

45:33.480 --> 45:34.750
but hark you, Margaret,

45:34.800 --> 45:37.390
No princely commendations to my king?

45:37.440 --> 45:40.110
Such commendations as becomes a maid,

45:40.160 --> 45:42.310
A virgin and his servant, say to him.

45:42.360 --> 45:44.230
And this withal.

45:54.360 --> 45:56.430
That for thyself...

45:58.080 --> 45:59.190
.. I will not so presume

45:59.240 --> 46:02.760
To send such peevish tokens to a king.

46:25.840 --> 46:28.630
Bring forth the sorceress.

46:33.760 --> 46:35.000
No!

46:41.600 --> 46:43.670
Tie her to the stake!

46:43.720 --> 46:45.630
For she has lived too long,

46:45.680 --> 46:48.980
To fill the world with vicious qualities.

46:52.880 --> 46:56.000
First, let me tell you
who you have condemn'd...

46:58.520 --> 47:01.750
Not me begotten of a shepherd swain,

47:01.800 --> 47:05.190
But issued from the progeny of kings,

47:05.240 --> 47:06.630
chosen from above,

47:06.680 --> 47:09.230
To work exceeding miracles on earth.

47:09.280 --> 47:12.280
I never had to do with wicked spirits!

47:13.080 --> 47:17.790
But you, that are
polluted with your lusts,

47:17.840 --> 47:21.630
Stain'd by guiltless blood of innocents,

47:21.680 --> 47:24.030
You judge it straight a thing impossible

47:24.080 --> 47:26.710
To compass wonders but by help of devils.

47:26.760 --> 47:29.470
Joan of Arc hath been

47:29.520 --> 47:33.230
Chaste and immaculate in very thought,

47:33.280 --> 47:36.110
Whose maiden blood,
thus rigorously abused,

47:36.160 --> 47:40.070
Will cry for vengeance
at the gates of heaven.

47:41.320 --> 47:43.870
Place barrels of pitch
upon the fatal stake,

47:43.920 --> 47:46.920
That so her torture may be shortened.

47:48.560 --> 47:50.760
Dispatch her straight.

47:55.440 --> 47:58.550
Will nothing turn your unrelenting hearts?

47:58.600 --> 48:01.680
Use no entreaty, for it is in vain.

48:02.840 --> 48:05.590
May never glorious sun reflex his beams

48:05.640 --> 48:08.230
Upon the country where you make abode,

48:08.280 --> 48:12.190
But darkness and the gloomy shade of death

48:12.240 --> 48:16.030
Environ you, till mischief and despair

48:16.080 --> 48:20.750
Drive you to break your
necks or hang yourselves!

48:20.800 --> 48:25.470
Break thou in pieces and consume to ashes,

48:25.520 --> 48:28.720
Thou foul accursed minister of hell!

49:27.760 --> 49:30.790
Your wondrous rare
description, noble earl,

49:30.840 --> 49:34.230
Of beauteous Margaret hath astonish'd me:

49:34.280 --> 49:37.630
Her virtues graced with external gifts

49:37.680 --> 49:42.310
Do breed love's settled
passions in my heart.

49:42.360 --> 49:44.590
And like as rigor of tempestuous gusts

49:44.640 --> 49:47.350
Provokes the mightiest
hulk against the tide,

49:47.400 --> 49:50.390
So am I driven by breath of her renown

49:50.440 --> 49:53.150
Either to suffer shipwreck or arrive

49:53.200 --> 49:55.270
Where I may have fruition of her love.

49:55.320 --> 49:58.710
Tush, my good lord, this superficial tale

49:58.760 --> 50:01.550
Is but a preface of her worthy praise.

50:01.600 --> 50:04.350
The chief perfections of that lovely dame

50:04.400 --> 50:06.510
Had I sufficient skill to utter them,

50:06.560 --> 50:08.630
Would make a volume of enticing lines,

50:08.680 --> 50:11.230
And, which is more, she is not so divine,

50:11.280 --> 50:13.510
But with as humble lowliness of mind

50:13.560 --> 50:16.310
She is content to be at your command,

50:16.360 --> 50:19.430
To love and honour Henry as her lord.

50:19.480 --> 50:23.510
And otherwise will Henry ne'er presume.

50:23.560 --> 50:29.030
Therefore, my Lord Protector, give consent

50:29.080 --> 50:33.640
That Margaret of Anjou be England's queen.

50:35.360 --> 50:38.720
So should I give consent to flatter sin.

50:43.240 --> 50:46.550
You know, my lord, your
highness is betroth'd

50:46.600 --> 50:48.110
Unto another lady of esteem:

50:48.160 --> 50:51.160
The daughter of the Earl of Armagnac.

50:51.960 --> 50:54.710
How shall we then dispense
with that contract,

50:54.760 --> 50:57.670
And not deface your honour with reproach?

50:57.720 --> 51:00.950
As doth a ruler with unlawful oaths.

51:01.000 --> 51:02.990
A poor earl's daughter is unequal odds,

51:03.040 --> 51:04.910
And therefore may be
broke without offence.

51:04.960 --> 51:07.190
Why, what, I pray, is
Margaret more than that?

51:07.240 --> 51:09.390
Her father is no better than an earl...

51:09.440 --> 51:11.070
Her father is of authority so great

51:11.120 --> 51:13.390
As his alliance will confirm our peace

51:13.440 --> 51:15.270
And keep the Frenchmen in allegiance.

51:15.320 --> 51:17.830
And so the Earl of Armagnac may do.

51:17.880 --> 51:21.870
Beside, his wealth does
warrant a liberal dower,

51:21.920 --> 51:25.230
Where Anjou sooner will receive than give.

51:25.280 --> 51:29.070
A dower, my lord!
Disgrace not so your king,

51:29.120 --> 51:32.630
That he should be so
abject, base and poor,

51:32.680 --> 51:35.830
To choose for wealth and
not for perfect love.

51:35.880 --> 51:38.110
Henry is able to enrich his queen

51:38.160 --> 51:40.150
Not seek a queen to make him rich:

51:40.200 --> 51:43.470
So worthless peasants
bargain for their wives,

51:43.520 --> 51:46.720
As market-men for oxen, sheep, or horse.

51:48.200 --> 51:51.140
Marriage is a matter of more worth.

51:51.560 --> 51:54.510
Who should we match
with Henry, being a king,

51:54.560 --> 51:56.310
But Margaret?

51:56.360 --> 51:59.190
Her valiant courage and undaunted spirit,

51:59.240 --> 52:01.630
Will answer our hope in issue of a king.

52:01.680 --> 52:03.510
For Henry, son unto a conqueror,

52:03.560 --> 52:05.750
Is likely to beget more conquerors,

52:05.800 --> 52:07.510
If with a lady of so high resolve

52:07.560 --> 52:10.720
As is fair Margaret he be link'd in love.

52:12.360 --> 52:15.630
Take shipping, post, my lord, to France.

52:15.680 --> 52:17.470
Agree to any covenants, and procure

52:17.520 --> 52:19.550
That Lady Margaret do vouchsafe to come

52:19.600 --> 52:21.790
To cross the seas to
England and be crown'd

52:21.840 --> 52:25.140
King Henry's faithful and anointed queen.

52:32.480 --> 52:36.430
And you, good uncle, banish all offence.

52:36.480 --> 52:38.510
If you do censure me by what you were,

52:38.560 --> 52:42.030
Not what you are, I know it will excuse

52:42.080 --> 52:44.880
This sudden execution of my will.

52:45.400 --> 52:47.000
Your Maj...

53:25.800 --> 53:29.150
As by your high imperial majesty

53:29.200 --> 53:31.870
I had in charge at my depart for France,

53:31.920 --> 53:35.550
To secure Princess
Margaret for Your Grace,

53:35.600 --> 53:37.950
I have perform'd my task.

53:38.000 --> 53:39.630
And humbly now upon my knee,

53:39.680 --> 53:42.150
In sight of England and her lordly peers,

53:42.200 --> 53:43.430
Deliver up

53:43.480 --> 53:47.310
The happiest gift that ever marquess gave,

53:47.360 --> 53:50.920
The fairest queen that ever king received.

54:34.760 --> 54:37.100
Welcome, Queen Margaret.

54:39.760 --> 54:42.190
I can express no kinder sign of love

54:42.240 --> 54:44.310
Than this kind kiss.

54:58.520 --> 55:02.110
O Lord, that lends me life,

55:02.160 --> 55:06.070
Lend me a heart replete with thankfulness!

55:06.120 --> 55:09.910
For thou hast given me
in this beauteous face

55:09.960 --> 55:13.000
A world of earthly blessings to my soul...

55:15.120 --> 55:19.400
If sympathy of love unite our thoughts.

55:21.440 --> 55:26.280
Great King of England
and my gracious lord,

55:27.680 --> 55:31.030
The mutual conference my mind hath made,

55:31.080 --> 55:34.950
By day, by night, waking and in my dreams,

55:35.000 --> 55:38.430
With you, my sovereign,

55:38.480 --> 55:42.600
Makes me the bolder to salute my king.

56:12.680 --> 56:19.040
Lords, with one cheerful
voice welcome my love.

56:20.920 --> 56:26.360
Long live Queen Margaret,
England's happiness!

56:27.480 --> 56:29.590
We thank you all.

56:31.760 --> 56:34.950
My Lord Protector, so
it please your grace,

56:35.000 --> 56:38.550
Here are details of the contracted peace

56:38.600 --> 56:43.520
Between our sovereign and
the French king Charles.

56:46.520 --> 56:50.190
"It is agreed between
the French king Charles,

56:50.240 --> 56:52.590
"and William Duke of Somerset,

56:52.640 --> 56:55.470
"ambassador for Henry King of England,

56:55.520 --> 56:58.990
"that the said Henry shall
espouse the Lady Margaret,

56:59.040 --> 57:02.110
"and crown her Queen of England.

57:02.160 --> 57:06.590
"That the duchy of Anjou, the
cities of Rouen and of Paris

57:06.640 --> 57:08.470
"and the county of Maine

57:08.520 --> 57:11.790
"shall be released and delivered
to the French king..."

57:15.640 --> 57:17.880
Uncle, how now!

57:20.160 --> 57:22.190
Pardon me, gracious lord,

57:22.240 --> 57:25.110
A sudden qualm hath struck me at the heart

57:25.160 --> 57:30.390
And dimm'd mine eyes,
that I can read no further.

57:30.440 --> 57:33.440
Uncle of Winchester, I pray, read on.

57:44.320 --> 57:48.670
"And she be sent over at the
King of England's own cost

57:48.720 --> 57:51.190
"without having any dowry."

57:54.400 --> 57:57.190
They please us well.

57:57.240 --> 57:59.580
Thanks, Uncle Winchester.

58:00.800 --> 58:04.200
Come, let us in.

58:24.080 --> 58:27.190
Brave peers of England,
pillars of the state,

58:27.240 --> 58:30.740
To you Duke Humphrey
must unload his grief.

58:31.160 --> 58:34.990
What! Did my brother
Henry spend his youth,

58:35.040 --> 58:38.480
His valour, coin and people, in the wars?

58:39.960 --> 58:43.070
Did he so often lodge in open field,

58:43.120 --> 58:46.270
In winter's cold and
summer's parching heat,

58:46.320 --> 58:49.990
To conquer France, his true inheritance?

58:50.040 --> 58:54.830
And did the noble Salisbury
and Talbot give up their lives

58:54.880 --> 58:56.990
To keep what Henry got?

58:57.040 --> 58:59.190
Have you yourselves,

58:59.240 --> 59:03.390
Received deep scars in
France and Normandy?

59:03.440 --> 59:06.520
And shall these labours
and these honours die?

59:08.080 --> 59:12.550
O peers of England,
shameful is this league!

59:12.600 --> 59:16.070
Fatal this marriage, cancelling your fame,

59:16.120 --> 59:18.870
Defacing monuments in conquer'd France,

59:18.920 --> 59:22.310
Undoing all, as if all had never been!

59:22.360 --> 59:25.590
Gloucester, what means
this passionate discourse?

59:25.640 --> 59:28.390
For France, 'tis ours,
and we will keep it still.

59:28.440 --> 59:29.830
Ay, we will keep it, if we can,

59:29.880 --> 59:31.630
But now it is impossible we should.

59:31.680 --> 59:33.910
Somerset hath given Anjou and Maine

59:33.960 --> 59:36.630
Unto the dauphin, who
now we must call King.

59:36.680 --> 59:40.950
Anjou and Maine, I
fought to win them both.

59:41.000 --> 59:44.430
And are the cities,
that I got with wounds,

59:44.480 --> 59:48.910
Delivered up again with peaceful words?

59:48.960 --> 59:52.030
France should have torn
and rent my very heart,

59:52.080 --> 59:55.110
Before I would have
yielded to this league.

59:55.160 --> 59:57.710
I never read but England's kings have had

59:57.760 --> 01:00:01.590
Great sums of gold and
dowries with their wives.

01:00:01.640 --> 01:00:05.070
And our King Henry gives away his own,

01:00:05.120 --> 01:00:07.630
To match with her that brings no vantages.

01:00:07.680 --> 01:00:11.070
She should have stayed in
France and starved in France!

01:00:11.120 --> 01:00:13.470
My Lord of Gloucester,
now ye grow too hot.

01:00:13.520 --> 01:00:15.310
My Lord of Winchester, I know your mind,

01:00:15.360 --> 01:00:17.150
'Tis not my speeches that you do mislike,

01:00:17.200 --> 01:00:20.350
But 'tis my presence that doth trouble ye.

01:00:20.400 --> 01:00:23.990
Lordings, farewell, and
say, when I am gone,

01:00:24.040 --> 01:00:27.120
I prophesied France will be lost ere long.

01:00:44.280 --> 01:00:47.560
So, there goes our Protector in a rage.

01:00:49.280 --> 01:00:52.710
'Tis known to you he is mine enemy,

01:00:52.760 --> 01:00:55.950
Nay, more, an enemy unto us all,

01:00:56.000 --> 01:00:59.600
And no great friend, I
fear me, to the King.

01:00:59.760 --> 01:01:01.910
Consider, sir, he is the next of blood,

01:01:01.960 --> 01:01:05.060
And heir apparent to the English crown.

01:01:06.360 --> 01:01:08.710
I fear me that for all
this flattering gloss,

01:01:08.760 --> 01:01:12.230
He will be found a dangerous protector.

01:01:12.280 --> 01:01:14.910
Why should he, then,
protect our sovereign,

01:01:14.960 --> 01:01:17.960
He being of age to govern of himself?

01:01:20.640 --> 01:01:24.910
My Lord of Winchester, join you with me,

01:01:24.960 --> 01:01:26.990
And together with the Duke of Somerset,

01:01:27.040 --> 01:01:30.940
We'll quickly hoist Duke
Humphrey from his seat.

01:01:32.840 --> 01:01:35.030
The day will come when
York shall claim his own,

01:01:35.080 --> 01:01:37.230
And, when I spy advantage,
claim the crown.

01:01:37.280 --> 01:01:39.910
Nor shall proud Lancaster usurp my right,

01:01:39.960 --> 01:01:42.150
Nor wear the diadem upon his head,

01:01:42.200 --> 01:01:45.110
Whose church-like humours
fits not for a king.

01:01:45.160 --> 01:01:49.110
Then, York, be still
awhile, till time do serve.

01:01:49.160 --> 01:01:52.470
Watch thou and wake when others be asleep,

01:01:52.520 --> 01:01:55.190
To pry into the secrets of the state,

01:01:55.240 --> 01:01:58.990
Till Henry, surfeiting in joys of love,

01:01:59.040 --> 01:02:03.470
And Humphrey with the
peers be fall'n at jars.

01:02:03.520 --> 01:02:07.830
Then will I raise aloft
the milk-white rose,

01:02:07.880 --> 01:02:11.950
And, force perforce, I'll
make him yield the crown,

01:02:12.000 --> 01:02:16.000
Whose bookish rule hath
pull'd fair England down.

01:02:49.560 --> 01:02:53.640
Why droops my lord,
like over-ripen'd corn?

01:02:55.600 --> 01:02:59.500
Why doth the great Duke
Humphrey knit his brows?

01:03:01.760 --> 01:03:05.990
Why are thine eyes fixed
to the sullen earth,

01:03:06.040 --> 01:03:09.750
Gazing on that which
seems to dim thy sight?

01:03:09.800 --> 01:03:12.000
What seest thou there?

01:03:14.720 --> 01:03:16.790
King Henry's crown?

01:03:17.480 --> 01:03:21.310
If so, gaze on, and grovel on thy face,

01:03:21.360 --> 01:03:24.560
Until thy head be circled with the same.

01:03:26.160 --> 01:03:27.950
Put forth thy hand,

01:03:28.000 --> 01:03:30.640
reach at the glorious gold.

01:03:32.600 --> 01:03:37.830
What, is't too short?
I'll lengthen it with mine.

01:03:37.880 --> 01:03:40.110
And, having both together heaved it up,

01:03:40.160 --> 01:03:42.750
We'll both together
lift our heads to heaven.

01:03:42.800 --> 01:03:46.310
O Nell, sweet Nell, if
thou dost love thy lord,

01:03:46.360 --> 01:03:49.670
Banish the canker of ambitious thoughts.

01:03:49.720 --> 01:03:52.230
And may that hour, when I imagine ill

01:03:52.280 --> 01:03:57.750
Against my king and
nephew, virtuous Henry,

01:03:57.800 --> 01:04:01.100
Be my last breathing in this mortal world!

01:04:05.680 --> 01:04:09.440
My troublous dream this
night has made me sad.

01:04:13.080 --> 01:04:17.870
What dream'd my lord? Tell
me, and I'll requite it

01:04:17.920 --> 01:04:21.420
With sweet rehearsal
of my morning's dream.

01:04:25.120 --> 01:04:27.840
Methought this staff...

01:04:29.360 --> 01:04:31.230
.. mine office-badge in court,

01:04:31.280 --> 01:04:36.630
Was broke in twain --
by whom I have forgot.

01:04:36.680 --> 01:04:40.110
But, as I think, it was by the cardinal,

01:04:40.160 --> 01:04:43.030
And on the pieces of the broken wand

01:04:43.080 --> 01:04:46.780
Were placed the heads
of Somerset and Suffolk.

01:04:48.120 --> 01:04:50.440
This was my dream.

01:04:52.720 --> 01:04:55.320
What it doth bode, God knows.

01:04:57.160 --> 01:04:59.510
This was nothing but an argument

01:04:59.560 --> 01:05:01.870
That he that breaks a
stick of Gloucester's grove

01:05:01.920 --> 01:05:05.270
Shall lose his head for his presumption.

01:05:05.320 --> 01:05:10.680
But list to me, my
Humphrey, my sweet duke:

01:05:13.040 --> 01:05:18.750
Methought I sat in seat of majesty

01:05:18.800 --> 01:05:22.910
In the cathedral church of Westminster,

01:05:22.960 --> 01:05:27.070
And in that chair where
kings and queens are crown'd,

01:05:27.120 --> 01:05:30.750
Where Henry and dame
Margaret kneel'd to me

01:05:30.800 --> 01:05:33.270
And on my head did set the diadem.

01:05:33.320 --> 01:05:36.390
Nay, Eleanor, then must I chide outright:

01:05:36.440 --> 01:05:39.030
Art thou not second woman in the realm,

01:05:39.080 --> 01:05:42.550
And the Protector's wife, beloved of him?

01:05:42.600 --> 01:05:46.070
And wilt thou still be
hammering treachery,

01:05:46.120 --> 01:05:48.550
To tumble down thy husband and thyself

01:05:48.600 --> 01:05:50.830
From top of honour to disgrace's feet?

01:05:50.880 --> 01:05:52.950
Away from me, and let me hear no more!

01:05:53.000 --> 01:05:54.470
What! What, are you so choleric

01:05:54.520 --> 01:05:56.790
With Eleanor, for telling but her dream?

01:05:56.840 --> 01:05:58.590
Next time I'll keep my dreams unto myself,

01:05:58.640 --> 01:06:00.390
And not be check'd.

01:06:00.440 --> 01:06:03.870
My Lord Protector, 'tis
his highness' pleasure

01:06:03.920 --> 01:06:08.590
You do prepare to join the assembly
that lately gathers at Westminster.

01:06:08.640 --> 01:06:09.910
I go.

01:06:16.760 --> 01:06:20.070
Nell, thou wilt come with us?

01:06:20.120 --> 01:06:23.420
Yes, my good lord, I'll follow presently.

01:08:06.880 --> 01:08:11.190
What, shall King Henry be a pupil still

01:08:11.240 --> 01:08:14.150
Under the surly Gloucester's governance?

01:08:14.200 --> 01:08:17.470
Am I a queen in title and in style,

01:08:17.520 --> 01:08:20.520
And must be made a subject to a duke?

01:08:22.319 --> 01:08:24.750
I tell thee, sir, when we first met

01:08:24.800 --> 01:08:27.510
I thought King Henry had resembled thee

01:08:27.560 --> 01:08:30.189
In courage, courtship and proportion.

01:08:30.240 --> 01:08:32.950
But all his mind is bent to holiness,

01:08:33.000 --> 01:08:37.149
To number Ave-Maries on his beads.

01:08:37.200 --> 01:08:38.710
I would the college of the cardinals

01:08:38.760 --> 01:08:42.229
Would choose him Pope,
and carry him to Rome:

01:08:42.279 --> 01:08:45.840
That were a state fit for his holiness.

01:08:49.640 --> 01:08:53.069
Madam, be patient: as I was cause

01:08:53.120 --> 01:08:55.430
Your highness came to England, so will I

01:08:55.479 --> 01:09:00.069
In England work your grace's full content.

01:09:00.120 --> 01:09:05.350
Beside the Lord Protector,
have we Winchester,

01:09:05.399 --> 01:09:10.710
The imperious churchman, Suffolk, Exeter,

01:09:10.760 --> 01:09:13.990
And grumbling York: and
not the least of these

01:09:14.040 --> 01:09:17.069
But can do more in England than the King.

01:09:17.120 --> 01:09:20.029
Not all these lords do vex me half so much

01:09:20.080 --> 01:09:25.600
As that proud dame, the
Lord Protector's wife.

01:09:27.080 --> 01:09:33.029
She sweeps it through the
court with troops of ladies,

01:09:33.080 --> 01:09:36.510
More like an empress than
Duke Humphrey's wife.

01:09:36.560 --> 01:09:39.270
Strangers in court do
take her for the queen.

01:09:39.319 --> 01:09:41.310
She bears a duke's revenues on her back,

01:09:41.359 --> 01:09:44.560
And in her heart she scorns our poverty.

01:09:47.600 --> 01:09:50.590
Shall I not live to be avenged on her?

01:09:50.640 --> 01:09:53.630
She vaunted 'mongst her
minions t'other day,

01:09:53.680 --> 01:09:57.230
The very train of her worst wearing gown

01:09:57.280 --> 01:10:00.750
Was better worth than
all my father's lands,

01:10:00.800 --> 01:10:03.630
Till Somerset gave two
dukedoms for his daughter.

01:10:03.680 --> 01:10:08.870
Madam, myself have limed a bush for her,

01:10:08.920 --> 01:10:11.510
And placed a quire of such enticing birds,

01:10:11.560 --> 01:10:13.870
That she will light to listen to the lays,

01:10:13.920 --> 01:10:15.990
And never mount to trouble you again.

01:10:16.040 --> 01:10:20.190
So, let her rest...

01:10:20.240 --> 01:10:23.950
and, madam, list to me,

01:10:24.000 --> 01:10:26.110
For I am bold to counsel you in this.

01:10:26.160 --> 01:10:28.550
Although we fancy not the cardinal,

01:10:28.600 --> 01:10:32.750
Yet must we join with
him and with the lords,

01:10:32.800 --> 01:10:36.840
Till we have brought Duke
Humphrey in disgrace.

01:10:38.880 --> 01:10:41.870
Then, one by one...

01:10:41.920 --> 01:10:45.070
we'll weed them all at last,

01:10:45.120 --> 01:10:48.840
And you yourself shall
steer the happy helm.

01:10:51.720 --> 01:10:54.030
If York have ill demean'd
himself in France,

01:10:54.080 --> 01:10:56.110
Then let him be denied the regentship.

01:10:56.160 --> 01:10:58.030
If Suffolk be unworthy of the place,

01:10:58.080 --> 01:11:01.070
Let York be regent. I will yield to him.

01:11:01.120 --> 01:11:04.270
Whether your grace be worthy, yea or no,

01:11:04.320 --> 01:11:07.320
Dispute not that York is the worthier.

01:11:08.840 --> 01:11:11.270
Ambitious Warwick, let thy betters speak.

01:11:11.320 --> 01:11:14.430
The cardinal's not my better in the field.

01:11:14.480 --> 01:11:17.070
All in this presence are
thy betters, Warwick.

01:11:17.120 --> 01:11:19.230
Warwick may live to be the best of all.

01:11:19.280 --> 01:11:22.190
Show some reason, Somerset,

01:11:22.240 --> 01:11:24.270
Why Suffolk should be preferred in this.

01:11:24.320 --> 01:11:28.020
Because the King,
forsooth, would have it so.

01:11:33.000 --> 01:11:37.270
Madam, the King is old enough himself

01:11:37.320 --> 01:11:40.600
To give his censure: these
are no women's matters.

01:11:43.000 --> 01:11:46.990
If he be old enough, what needs your grace

01:11:47.040 --> 01:11:50.150
To be protector of his excellence?

01:11:51.600 --> 01:11:54.950
Madam, I am protector of the realm,

01:11:55.000 --> 01:11:59.750
And, at his pleasure,
will resign my place.

01:11:59.800 --> 01:12:05.190
Resign it then and leave thine insolence.

01:12:05.240 --> 01:12:09.390
Since thou wert king -- and
who is king but thou? --

01:12:09.440 --> 01:12:12.030
The commonwealth hath daily run to wreck,

01:12:12.080 --> 01:12:14.470
The dauphin hath prevail'd
beyond the seas,

01:12:14.520 --> 01:12:16.630
And all the peers and nobles of the realm

01:12:16.680 --> 01:12:18.990
Have been as bondsmen to thy sovereignty.

01:12:19.040 --> 01:12:21.550
The commons hast thou
rack'd, the clergy's bags

01:12:21.600 --> 01:12:23.750
Are lank and lean with thy extortions.

01:12:23.800 --> 01:12:27.630
Thy sumptuous buildings
and thy wife's attire

01:12:27.680 --> 01:12:30.030
Have cost a mass of public treasury.

01:12:30.080 --> 01:12:32.670
They sale of offices and towns in France,

01:12:32.720 --> 01:12:35.150
If they were known, as
the suspect is great,

01:12:35.200 --> 01:12:38.900
Would make thee quickly
hop without thy head.

01:12:39.280 --> 01:12:40.680
Enough!

01:12:42.840 --> 01:12:46.160
The King knows what he knows.

01:12:52.600 --> 01:12:53.740
Oh!

01:13:01.440 --> 01:13:03.240
Give me my fan.

01:13:27.200 --> 01:13:30.880
What, minion! Can ye not?

01:13:36.760 --> 01:13:38.550
Proud Frenchwoman.

01:13:38.600 --> 01:13:40.990
Could I come near your
beauty with my nails,

01:13:41.040 --> 01:13:43.310
I'd set my ten commandments in your face.

01:13:43.360 --> 01:13:47.030
Sweet aunt, be quiet,
'twas against her will.

01:13:47.080 --> 01:13:49.020
Against her will!

01:13:50.480 --> 01:13:55.190
Good King, look to it in time,

01:13:55.240 --> 01:13:59.000
She shall not strike
Dame Eleanor unrevenged.

01:14:24.200 --> 01:14:26.990
What a point, my lord, your falcon made,

01:14:27.040 --> 01:14:29.190
And what a pitch she flew above the rest!

01:14:29.240 --> 01:14:30.950
No marvel, an it like Your Majesty,

01:14:31.000 --> 01:14:33.430
My Lord Protector's
hawks do tower so well.

01:14:33.480 --> 01:14:35.510
They know their master loves to be aloft,

01:14:35.560 --> 01:14:38.550
And bears his thoughts
above a falcon's pitch.

01:14:38.600 --> 01:14:41.550
My lord, 'tis but a base ignoble mind

01:14:41.600 --> 01:14:44.430
That mounts no higher
than a bird can soar.

01:14:44.480 --> 01:14:47.110
I thought as much, he
would be above the clouds.

01:14:47.160 --> 01:14:50.630
Why, Somerset, England
knows thine insolence.

01:14:50.680 --> 01:14:53.390
And thy ambition, Gloucester.

01:14:53.440 --> 01:14:55.510
I prithee, peace, good Queen,

01:14:55.560 --> 01:14:58.550
And whet not on these furious peers,

01:14:58.600 --> 01:15:02.270
For blessed are the peacemakers on earth.

01:15:02.320 --> 01:15:06.750
The winds grow high, and
so do your stomachs, lords.

01:15:06.800 --> 01:15:09.740
I pray, let me compound this strife.

01:15:12.280 --> 01:15:13.990
What tidings with our holy uncle?

01:15:14.040 --> 01:15:17.240
Such as my heart doth tremble to unfold.

01:15:17.560 --> 01:15:21.350
Lady Eleanor, the Protector's wife,

01:15:21.400 --> 01:15:25.230
Hath practised dangerously
against your state,

01:15:25.280 --> 01:15:28.950
Raising up wicked spirits
from under ground,

01:15:29.000 --> 01:15:32.230
Demanding of King Henry's life and death,

01:15:32.280 --> 01:15:35.030
And other of your highness' privy-council,

01:15:35.080 --> 01:15:39.640
As more at large your
grace shall understand.

01:15:47.120 --> 01:15:49.590
And so, my Lord Protector, by this means

01:15:49.640 --> 01:15:52.310
Your lady is forthcoming yet at London.

01:15:52.360 --> 01:15:55.270
This news, I think, hath
turn'd your weapon's edge.

01:15:55.320 --> 01:15:58.620
Ambitious lord, leave to afflict my heart.

01:15:59.280 --> 01:16:03.830
Sorrow and grief have
vanquish'd all my powers,

01:16:03.880 --> 01:16:07.120
And, vanquish'd as I am, I yield to thee.

01:16:08.800 --> 01:16:13.510
O God, what mischiefs
work the wicked ones,

01:16:13.560 --> 01:16:17.750
Heaping confusion on
their own heads thereby!

01:16:17.800 --> 01:16:21.720
Gloucester, see here the
tainture of thy nest.

01:16:23.040 --> 01:16:26.310
And look thyself be
faultless, thou wert best.

01:16:26.360 --> 01:16:28.950
Madam, for myself, to heaven I do appeal,

01:16:29.000 --> 01:16:32.830
How I have loved my king and commonweal.

01:16:32.880 --> 01:16:35.670
And, for my wife, I
know not how it stands.

01:16:35.720 --> 01:16:37.990
Sorry I am to hear what I have heard:

01:16:38.040 --> 01:16:40.870
Noble she is, but if she have forgot

01:16:40.920 --> 01:16:42.790
Honour and virtue and conversed with such

01:16:42.840 --> 01:16:44.990
I banish her my bed and company

01:16:45.040 --> 01:16:47.230
And give her as a prey to law and shame,

01:16:47.280 --> 01:16:51.080
That hath dishonour'd
Gloucester's honest name.

01:16:52.200 --> 01:16:57.710
Well, for this night
we will repose us here.

01:16:57.760 --> 01:16:59.710
To-morrow toward London back again,

01:16:59.760 --> 01:17:03.280
To look into this business thoroughly.

01:17:25.320 --> 01:17:27.790
- Come on. - No! - Come on.

01:18:20.760 --> 01:18:23.640
Stand forth, Dame Eleanor Cobham.

01:18:28.360 --> 01:18:34.040
In sight of God and us,
your guilt is great:

01:18:36.400 --> 01:18:40.390
Receive the sentence of the law for sin

01:18:40.440 --> 01:18:44.640
Such as by God's book
are adjudged to death.

01:18:47.200 --> 01:18:52.190
You, madam, for you are so nobly born,

01:18:52.240 --> 01:18:57.470
Shall, after three days'
open penance done,

01:18:57.520 --> 01:19:00.670
Live in your country here in banishment,

01:19:00.720 --> 01:19:04.710
With Sir John Gladsdale,
in the Isle of Man.

01:19:09.600 --> 01:19:11.940
Welcome is my banishment.

01:19:17.200 --> 01:19:19.270
Welcome is my death.

01:19:20.560 --> 01:19:26.310
Eleanor, the law, thou
see'st, hath judged thee:

01:19:26.360 --> 01:19:29.400
I cannot justify whom the law condemns.

01:19:31.000 --> 01:19:34.310
Mine eyes are full of
tears, my heart of grief.

01:19:36.440 --> 01:19:40.110
Ah, Humphrey, this dishonour in thine age

01:19:40.160 --> 01:19:44.870
Will bring thy head with
sorrow to the ground!

01:19:47.960 --> 01:19:50.950
I do beseech Your Majesty,
give me leave to go.

01:19:51.000 --> 01:19:55.560
Sorrow would solace and
mine age would ease.

01:20:00.040 --> 01:20:06.350
Stay, Humphrey Duke of
Gloucester: ere thou go,

01:20:06.400 --> 01:20:11.310
Give up thy staff. Henry will to himself

01:20:11.360 --> 01:20:15.520
Protector be, and God shall be my guide.

01:20:18.640 --> 01:20:23.430
But go in peace, Humphrey, no less beloved

01:20:23.480 --> 01:20:26.750
Than when thou wert Protector to thy King.

01:20:26.800 --> 01:20:29.390
I see no reason why a king of years

01:20:29.440 --> 01:20:33.720
Should be protected like a child.

01:20:35.840 --> 01:20:40.030
God and King Henry govern England's realm.

01:20:40.080 --> 01:20:43.990
Give up your staff, sir,
and the King his realm.

01:20:46.600 --> 01:20:48.680
My staff?

01:20:50.000 --> 01:20:55.440
Here, noble Henry, is my staff.

01:20:56.680 --> 01:21:00.270
As willingly do I the same resign

01:21:00.320 --> 01:21:03.440
As e'er thy father Henry made it mine.

01:21:05.880 --> 01:21:12.760
And even as willingly
at thy feet I leave it

01:21:14.800 --> 01:21:18.400
As others would ambitiously receive it.

01:21:22.400 --> 01:21:27.950
Farewell, good King:
when I am dead and gone,

01:21:28.000 --> 01:21:31.080
May honourable peace attend thy throne!

01:21:55.840 --> 01:22:03.110
This staff of honour
raught, there let it stand

01:22:03.160 --> 01:22:09.000
Where it best fits to be, in Henry's hand.

01:22:23.360 --> 01:22:25.830
Witch! Witch!

01:22:25.880 --> 01:22:27.400
Move!

01:22:38.800 --> 01:22:40.070
Eleanor!

01:22:40.120 --> 01:22:44.270
Come you, my lord, to see my open shame?

01:22:44.320 --> 01:22:47.190
Now thou dost penance too.

01:22:47.240 --> 01:22:49.430
Hear how they mock.

01:22:49.480 --> 01:22:53.950
Ah, Gloucester, hide thee
from their hateful taunts,

01:22:54.000 --> 01:22:56.910
And, in thy closet pent up, rue my shame,

01:22:56.960 --> 01:23:00.310
And ban thine enemies,
both mine and thine!

01:23:00.360 --> 01:23:02.590
Be patient, gentle Nell,
forget this grief.

01:23:02.640 --> 01:23:06.510
Ah, Gloucester, teach me to forget myself!

01:23:06.560 --> 01:23:08.670
For whilst I think I am thy married wife

01:23:08.720 --> 01:23:11.070
Methinks I should not thus be led along,

01:23:11.120 --> 01:23:13.710
Mail'd up in shame,
with papers on my back,

01:23:13.760 --> 01:23:16.390
The ruthless flint doth
cut my tender feet,

01:23:16.440 --> 01:23:19.110
And when I start, the
envious people laugh.

01:23:19.160 --> 01:23:25.430
Ah, Humphrey, can I
bear this shameful yoke?

01:23:25.480 --> 01:23:28.190
No, dark shall be my
light and night my day.

01:23:28.240 --> 01:23:31.390
To think upon my pomp shall be my hell.

01:23:31.440 --> 01:23:34.470
Please you, Sir John,
protect my lady here?

01:23:34.520 --> 01:23:36.390
Entreat her not the worse in that I pray

01:23:36.440 --> 01:23:37.670
You use her well.

01:23:37.720 --> 01:23:42.470
Sometime I'll say, I
am Duke Humphrey's wife,

01:23:42.520 --> 01:23:45.430
And he a prince and ruler of the land:

01:23:45.480 --> 01:23:48.070
Yet so he ruled and such a prince he was

01:23:48.120 --> 01:23:51.310
As he stood by whilst
I, his forlorn duchess,

01:23:51.360 --> 01:23:55.310
Was made a wonder and a pointing-stock.

01:23:55.360 --> 01:23:59.990
For Somerset, and York,
and that false priest,

01:24:00.040 --> 01:24:02.790
Have all limed bushes to betray thy wings,

01:24:02.840 --> 01:24:07.550
And, fly thou how thou
canst, they'll tangle thee.

01:24:07.600 --> 01:24:11.350
Gentle Nell, forbear!
thou aimest all awry.

01:24:11.400 --> 01:24:14.230
I must offend before I be attainted,

01:24:14.280 --> 01:24:16.910
And had I twenty times so many foes,

01:24:16.960 --> 01:24:20.310
All these could not procure me any scathe,

01:24:20.360 --> 01:24:24.190
So long as I am loyal, true and crimeless.

01:24:24.240 --> 01:24:27.750
Thy greatest help is quiet, gentle Nell:

01:24:27.800 --> 01:24:30.670
I pray thee, sort thy heart to patience.

01:24:30.720 --> 01:24:34.320
These few days' wonder
will be quickly worn.

01:24:34.760 --> 01:24:36.230
Humphrey!

01:24:57.960 --> 01:25:03.470
Your Grace is summoned to
a meeting at the palace.

01:25:03.520 --> 01:25:06.270
A meeting, now?

01:25:06.320 --> 01:25:09.620
And my consent ne'er ask'd herein before!

01:25:10.560 --> 01:25:12.760
This is close dealing.

01:25:14.520 --> 01:25:17.880
Well, I will be there.

01:25:24.360 --> 01:25:27.710
My heart assures me
that the Earl of Warwick

01:25:27.760 --> 01:25:31.260
Shall one day make the
Duke of York a king.

01:25:33.080 --> 01:25:36.670
And, my friend this I do assure myself:

01:25:36.720 --> 01:25:39.430
that Richard shall live to one
day make the Earl of Warwick

01:25:39.480 --> 01:25:42.520
The greatest man in England but the King.

01:26:08.560 --> 01:26:12.910
I muse my Lord of Gloucester is not here:

01:26:12.960 --> 01:26:15.790
'Tis not his wont to be the hindmost man.

01:26:15.840 --> 01:26:20.430
Can you not see? or will ye not observe

01:26:20.480 --> 01:26:23.910
The strangeness of his
alter'd countenance?

01:26:23.960 --> 01:26:28.270
With what a majesty he bears himself,

01:26:28.320 --> 01:26:31.510
How insolent of late he is become,

01:26:31.560 --> 01:26:35.070
How proud, how peremptory,
and unlike himself?

01:26:35.120 --> 01:26:38.710
We know the time since
he was mild and affable,

01:26:38.760 --> 01:26:42.310
And all the court admired
him for submission.

01:26:42.360 --> 01:26:46.310
But meet him now, and, be it in the morn,

01:26:46.360 --> 01:26:49.390
When every one will give the time of day,

01:26:49.440 --> 01:26:54.350
He knits his brow and shows an angry eye,

01:26:54.400 --> 01:26:59.030
Disdaining duty that to us belongs.

01:26:59.080 --> 01:27:02.910
Humphrey is no little man in England.

01:27:02.960 --> 01:27:07.870
And should you fall, he
as the next will mount.

01:27:07.920 --> 01:27:09.270
Me seemeth then it is no policy,

01:27:09.320 --> 01:27:11.190
Respecting what a rancorous mind he bears

01:27:11.240 --> 01:27:13.030
That he should come
about your royal person

01:27:13.080 --> 01:27:15.830
Or be admitted to Your Highness' council.

01:27:15.880 --> 01:27:18.150
The reverent care I bear unto my lord

01:27:18.200 --> 01:27:22.840
Made me collect these dangers in the duke.

01:27:24.200 --> 01:27:26.230
My Lord Somerset and Winchester

01:27:26.280 --> 01:27:30.560
Reprove my allegation, if you can,
Or else conclude my words effectual.

01:27:31.880 --> 01:27:35.150
Well hath Your Highness
seen into this duke.

01:27:35.200 --> 01:27:37.430
And, had I first been
put to speak my mind,

01:27:37.480 --> 01:27:39.470
I think I should have
told Your Grace's tale.

01:27:39.520 --> 01:27:43.030
- Mm. - The duchess, by his subornation,

01:27:43.080 --> 01:27:47.950
Upon my life, began her
devilish practises:

01:27:48.000 --> 01:27:52.070
Smooth runs the water
where the brook is deep,

01:27:52.120 --> 01:27:55.270
The fox barks not when
he would steal the lamb.

01:27:55.320 --> 01:27:59.230
No, my sovereign, Gloucester is a man

01:27:59.280 --> 01:28:03.120
Unsounded yet and full of deep deceit.

01:28:05.960 --> 01:28:07.910
Our kinsman Gloucester is as innocent

01:28:07.960 --> 01:28:10.110
From meaning treason to our royal person

01:28:10.160 --> 01:28:13.070
As is the sucking lamb or harmless dove.

01:28:13.120 --> 01:28:15.350
The duke is virtuous,
mild and too well given

01:28:15.400 --> 01:28:18.600
To dream on evil or to work my downfall.

01:28:19.200 --> 01:28:26.560
Seems he a dove? His
feathers are but borrowed,

01:28:28.160 --> 01:28:31.640
For he's disposed as the hateful raven.

01:28:32.960 --> 01:28:37.800
Is he a lamb? His skin is surely lent him,

01:28:39.080 --> 01:28:42.920
For he's inclined as is the ravenous wolf.

01:28:44.000 --> 01:28:47.190
Take heed, my lord, the welfare of us all

01:28:47.240 --> 01:28:51.030
Hangs on the cutting
short that fraudful man.

01:29:01.040 --> 01:29:04.030
All health unto my gracious sovereign!

01:29:04.080 --> 01:29:07.640
Welcome, Sir William.
What news from France?

01:29:11.360 --> 01:29:14.550
That Charles the dauphin
breaks his foresworn oath

01:29:14.600 --> 01:29:17.910
and raises his flag over every, all town.

01:29:17.960 --> 01:29:20.830
He is proclaimed king by every mouth

01:29:20.880 --> 01:29:25.790
and all your interest in those
territories is utterly bereft you.

01:29:25.840 --> 01:29:27.510
All is lost.

01:29:29.720 --> 01:29:34.190
Cold news, my lord, from France:

01:29:34.240 --> 01:29:36.510
But God's will be done!

01:29:45.040 --> 01:29:47.350
All happiness unto my lord the King!

01:29:47.400 --> 01:29:50.510
Pardon, my liege, that
I have stay'd so long.

01:29:50.560 --> 01:29:54.560
Nay, Gloucester, know that
thou art come too soon.

01:29:56.640 --> 01:29:59.640
I do arrest thee of high treason here.

01:30:01.480 --> 01:30:04.950
Well, Somerset, thou
shalt not see me blush

01:30:05.000 --> 01:30:08.070
Nor change my countenance for this arrest:

01:30:08.120 --> 01:30:10.110
The purest spring is not so free from mud

01:30:10.160 --> 01:30:13.660
As I am clear from
treason to my sovereign.

01:30:14.960 --> 01:30:19.190
Who can accuse me? Wherein am I guilty?

01:30:19.240 --> 01:30:23.590
'Tis thought, my lord, that
you took bribes of France,

01:30:23.640 --> 01:30:27.230
And, being Protector,
stayed the soldiers' pay,

01:30:27.280 --> 01:30:30.790
By means whereof His
Highness hath lost France.

01:30:30.840 --> 01:30:34.760
Is it but thought so? What
are they that think it?

01:30:36.640 --> 01:30:40.070
I never robb'd the soldiers of their pay,

01:30:40.120 --> 01:30:42.510
So help me God, as I
have watch'd the night,

01:30:42.560 --> 01:30:46.430
Ay, night by night, in
studying good for England.

01:30:46.480 --> 01:30:49.590
No, many a pound of mine own proper store,

01:30:49.640 --> 01:30:51.830
Because I would not tax the needy commons,

01:30:51.880 --> 01:30:54.990
Have I disbursed to the garrisons,
And never ask'd for restitution.

01:30:55.040 --> 01:30:58.230
It serves you well, my
lord, to say so much.

01:30:58.280 --> 01:31:00.310
I say no more than truth, so help me God!

01:31:00.360 --> 01:31:02.110
In your protectorship you did devise

01:31:02.160 --> 01:31:04.830
Strange tortures for
offenders never heard of,

01:31:04.880 --> 01:31:06.550
That England was defamed by tyranny.

01:31:06.600 --> 01:31:08.750
Why, 'tis well known that,
whiles I was Protector,

01:31:08.800 --> 01:31:11.030
Pity was all the fault that was in me,

01:31:11.080 --> 01:31:12.870
For I should melt at an offender's tears.

01:31:12.920 --> 01:31:15.390
My lord, these faults are
easy, quickly answered:

01:31:15.440 --> 01:31:17.670
But mightier crimes are
laid unto your charge,

01:31:17.720 --> 01:31:19.990
Whereof you cannot easily purge yourself.

01:31:20.040 --> 01:31:21.710
I do arrest you in His Highness' name...

01:31:21.760 --> 01:31:22.830
Your Majesty!

01:31:22.880 --> 01:31:24.630
.. and here commit you to my lord cardinal

01:31:24.680 --> 01:31:26.310
To keep, until your further time of trial.

01:31:26.360 --> 01:31:28.270
Your Majesty!

01:31:28.320 --> 01:31:30.910
Oh, Uncle Gloucester, 'tis my special hope

01:31:30.960 --> 01:31:33.590
That you will clear
yourself from all suspect.

01:31:33.640 --> 01:31:36.990
My conscience tells me he is innocent.

01:31:37.040 --> 01:31:40.430
Ah, gracious lord, these
days are dangerous:

01:31:40.480 --> 01:31:43.870
Virtue is choked with foul ambition.

01:31:43.920 --> 01:31:47.120
I know their complot is to have my life,

01:31:48.960 --> 01:31:52.550
And if my death might
make this island happy,

01:31:52.600 --> 01:31:55.550
And prove the period of their tyranny,

01:31:55.600 --> 01:31:59.030
I would expend it with all willingness.

01:31:59.080 --> 01:32:02.630
But mine is made the
prologue to their play,

01:32:02.680 --> 01:32:05.950
For thousands more, that
yet suspect no peril,

01:32:06.000 --> 01:32:08.750
Will not conclude their plotted tragedy.

01:32:08.800 --> 01:32:12.150
Somerset's red eyes
blab his heart's malice,

01:32:12.200 --> 01:32:14.230
Thou Winchester, that reaches at the moon,

01:32:14.280 --> 01:32:16.430
Whose overweening arm I have pluck'd back,

01:32:16.480 --> 01:32:20.390
By false accuse does level at my life.

01:32:20.440 --> 01:32:24.710
And you, my sovereign lady, with the rest,

01:32:24.760 --> 01:32:28.750
Causeless have laid disgraces on my head,

01:32:28.800 --> 01:32:32.990
And with your best
endeavour have stirr'd up

01:32:33.040 --> 01:32:36.720
My beloved liege to be mine enemy.

01:32:38.720 --> 01:32:43.910
Ay, all you have laid your heads together

01:32:43.960 --> 01:32:47.470
And all to make away my blameless life.

01:32:47.520 --> 01:32:50.910
I shall not want false
witness to condemn me,

01:32:50.960 --> 01:32:54.270
Nor stores of treasons
to augment my guilt.

01:32:54.320 --> 01:32:57.670
The ancient proverb will be well effected:

01:32:57.720 --> 01:33:00.310
"A staff is quickly found to beat a dog."

01:33:00.360 --> 01:33:02.030
My liege, his railing is intolerable.

01:33:02.080 --> 01:33:04.070
He'll wrest the sense and
hold us here all day.

01:33:04.120 --> 01:33:06.310
- Cardinal, he is your prisoner.
- Take away the duke.

01:33:06.360 --> 01:33:09.630
Ah! Thus King Henry throws away his crutch

01:33:09.680 --> 01:33:12.950
Before his legs be firm to bear his body.

01:33:13.000 --> 01:33:17.390
Thus is the shepherd beaten from thy side,

01:33:17.440 --> 01:33:21.710
And wolves are gnarling
who will gnaw thee first.

01:33:21.760 --> 01:33:25.030
Ah, that my fear were
false! Ah, that it were!

01:33:25.080 --> 01:33:28.480
For, good King Henry, thy decay I fear.

01:33:35.640 --> 01:33:38.640
Your Majesty needs o'erlook this bill.

01:33:39.400 --> 01:33:43.630
My lords, what to your
wisdoms seemeth best,

01:33:43.680 --> 01:33:46.620
Do or undo, as if ourself were here.

01:33:51.800 --> 01:33:54.760
What, will your highness leave?

01:33:56.080 --> 01:33:59.310
Ay, Margaret,

01:33:59.360 --> 01:34:02.030
my heart is drown'd with grief.

01:34:25.320 --> 01:34:27.550
Uncle Humphrey!

01:34:27.600 --> 01:34:30.110
In thy face I see

01:34:30.160 --> 01:34:34.160
The map of honour, truth and loyalty.

01:34:35.920 --> 01:34:38.390
Thou never didst them wrong,

01:34:38.440 --> 01:34:41.190
nor no man wrong,

01:34:41.240 --> 01:34:45.830
And as the butcher takes away the calf

01:34:45.880 --> 01:34:49.310
And binds the wretch, and
beats it when it strains,

01:34:49.360 --> 01:34:52.070
Bearing it to the bloody slaughterhouse,

01:34:52.120 --> 01:34:55.440
Even so remorseless have
they borne him hence.

01:34:57.920 --> 01:35:02.910
His fortunes I will weep, and,

01:35:02.960 --> 01:35:04.510
'twixt each groan

01:35:04.560 --> 01:35:11.840
Say "Who's a traitor?
Gloucester he is none."

01:35:20.840 --> 01:35:24.190
Henry my lord is cold in great affairs,

01:35:24.240 --> 01:35:26.910
Too full of foolish pity,
and Gloucester's show

01:35:26.960 --> 01:35:28.700
Beguiles him.

01:35:30.800 --> 01:35:33.990
This Gloucester should
be quickly rid the world,

01:35:34.040 --> 01:35:37.040
To rid us of the fear we have of him.

01:35:38.960 --> 01:35:44.430
That he should die is worthy policy,

01:35:44.480 --> 01:35:48.030
But yet we want a colour for his death.

01:35:48.080 --> 01:35:50.710
'Tis meet he be condemn'd
by course of law.

01:35:50.760 --> 01:35:52.790
But, in my mind, that were no policy.

01:35:52.840 --> 01:35:54.790
The King will labour
still to save his life,

01:35:54.840 --> 01:35:56.710
The commons haply rise, to save his life,

01:35:56.760 --> 01:36:00.790
And yet we have a trivial argument,

01:36:00.840 --> 01:36:03.870
More than mistrust, that
shows him worthy death.

01:36:03.920 --> 01:36:08.190
So that, by this, you
would not have him die.

01:36:08.240 --> 01:36:10.710
Would not a fool alone appoint a fox

01:36:10.760 --> 01:36:13.430
To guard a chicken from a hungry kite?

01:36:13.480 --> 01:36:15.670
So the chicken should be sure of death.

01:36:15.720 --> 01:36:20.310
Madam, 'tis true. That Gloucester
die, and that he is a fox.

01:36:20.360 --> 01:36:23.030
By nature proved an enemy to the flock,

01:36:23.080 --> 01:36:26.880
Before his chaps be stain'd
with crimson blood.

01:36:28.280 --> 01:36:30.470
And us not stand debating how to slay him:

01:36:30.520 --> 01:36:32.910
Be it by gins, by snares, by subtlety,

01:36:32.960 --> 01:36:35.110
Sleeping or waking, 'tis no matter how,

01:36:35.160 --> 01:36:36.900
So he be dead.

01:36:40.400 --> 01:36:43.840
Thrice-noble Somerset, 'tis briefly spoke.

01:36:47.160 --> 01:36:49.030
Not bravely yet.

01:36:52.280 --> 01:36:55.270
Say but the word, my lords,

01:36:55.320 --> 01:36:57.440
I'll be his priest.

01:37:00.520 --> 01:37:02.390
Here is my hand.

01:37:04.400 --> 01:37:06.190
The deed is worthy doing.

01:37:06.240 --> 01:37:07.630
And so say I.

01:37:07.680 --> 01:37:09.670
And I.

01:37:09.720 --> 01:37:13.630
And now we three have spoke it,

01:37:13.680 --> 01:37:17.180
It skills not greatly
who impugns our doom.

01:37:18.840 --> 01:37:20.910
Farewell, my lords.

01:40:01.160 --> 01:40:03.630
Now, sirs, have you dispatch'd this thing?

01:40:03.680 --> 01:40:05.830
Ay, my good lord, 'tis done.

01:40:05.880 --> 01:40:08.080
Why, that's well said.

01:40:08.720 --> 01:40:12.430
Go, get your hands away, I will
reward you for this venturous deed.

01:40:12.480 --> 01:40:15.020
Have you laid fair the body?

01:40:15.080 --> 01:40:19.270
Are all things well, according
as I gave directions?

01:40:19.320 --> 01:40:21.390
'Tis, my good lord.

01:40:24.160 --> 01:40:25.900
Away! Be gone.

01:40:48.360 --> 01:40:51.390
Go, call our uncle to
our presence straight,

01:40:51.440 --> 01:40:53.790
Say we intend to try his grace today.

01:40:53.840 --> 01:40:56.940
I'll call him presently, my noble lord.

01:41:05.840 --> 01:41:11.270
My lords, prepare the
trial, and, I pray you

01:41:11.320 --> 01:41:13.990
Proceed no straiter 'gainst
our uncle Gloucester

01:41:14.040 --> 01:41:17.750
Than from true evidence of good esteem

01:41:17.800 --> 01:41:20.470
He be approved in practise culpable.

01:41:20.520 --> 01:41:23.270
God forbid any malice should prevail,

01:41:23.320 --> 01:41:26.790
That faultless may condemn a nobleman!

01:41:26.840 --> 01:41:30.190
Pray God he may acquit him of suspicion!

01:41:30.240 --> 01:41:34.080
I thank thee, Meg, these
words content me much.

01:41:42.880 --> 01:41:45.150
How now!

01:41:45.200 --> 01:41:48.110
Why look'st thou pale?

01:41:48.160 --> 01:41:49.630
Why tremblest thou?

01:41:49.680 --> 01:41:51.790
Where is our uncle?

01:41:51.840 --> 01:41:54.710
Dead, my lord, Gloucester is dead.

01:41:55.760 --> 01:41:57.110
Marry, God forfend!

01:41:57.160 --> 01:41:59.360
God's secret judgment.

01:42:03.680 --> 01:42:05.240
My lord!

01:42:08.200 --> 01:42:11.200
O Henry, ope thine eyes!

01:42:14.000 --> 01:42:15.390
How fares my gracious lord?

01:42:15.440 --> 01:42:17.510
Comfort, my sovereign!

01:42:17.560 --> 01:42:19.900
Gracious Henry, comfort!

01:42:20.920 --> 01:42:25.710
What, doth my Lord Somerset comfort me?

01:42:25.760 --> 01:42:28.830
Lay not thy hands on me, forbear, I say.

01:42:28.880 --> 01:42:32.080
Thou baleful messenger, out of my sight!

01:42:34.600 --> 01:42:37.630
Good Warwick, come with me

01:42:37.680 --> 01:42:41.480
into his chamber to view
his breathless corpse.

01:43:06.440 --> 01:43:10.230
O Thou that judgest all things,

01:43:10.280 --> 01:43:12.520
stay my thoughts.

01:43:16.280 --> 01:43:19.020
Come hither, gracious sovereign.

01:44:19.040 --> 01:44:23.550
As surely as my soul intends to live

01:44:23.600 --> 01:44:27.870
I do believe that violent hands were laid

01:44:27.920 --> 01:44:30.470
Upon the life of this thrice-famed duke.

01:44:30.520 --> 01:44:34.220
Why, Warwick, who would
do the duke to death?

01:44:34.560 --> 01:44:37.070
Myself had him in protection,

01:44:37.120 --> 01:44:40.110
Charged his safety with
Somerset and Suffolk.

01:44:40.160 --> 01:44:42.630
And we, I hope, sir, are no murderers.

01:44:42.680 --> 01:44:44.870
But all of you are vow'd
Duke Humphrey's foes,

01:44:44.920 --> 01:44:47.990
And 'tis well seen he found an enemy.

01:44:48.040 --> 01:44:50.510
Are you the butcher, Somerset?

01:44:50.560 --> 01:44:53.390
Where's your knife?

01:44:53.440 --> 01:44:55.710
I wear no knife to slaughter sleeping men,

01:44:55.760 --> 01:44:59.950
But here's a vengeful
sword, rusted with ease,

01:45:00.000 --> 01:45:02.510
That shall be scoured
in his rancorous heart

01:45:02.560 --> 01:45:05.830
That slanders me with
murder's crimson badge.

01:45:05.880 --> 01:45:07.270
Warwick!

01:45:07.320 --> 01:45:08.670
Madam, with reverence may I say,

01:45:08.720 --> 01:45:11.270
For every word you speak in his behalf

01:45:11.320 --> 01:45:13.750
Is slander to your royal dignity.

01:45:13.800 --> 01:45:17.590
Blunt-witted lord, ignoble in demeanour!

01:45:17.640 --> 01:45:20.910
Thy mother took unto her blameful bed

01:45:20.960 --> 01:45:25.310
Some stern untutor'd
churl, and noble stock

01:45:25.360 --> 01:45:28.950
Was graft with crab-tree
slip, whose fruit thou art.

01:45:29.000 --> 01:45:30.960
Exeter.

01:45:35.280 --> 01:45:39.190
Why, how now, lords!

01:45:39.240 --> 01:45:41.470
Your wrathful weapons drawn

01:45:41.520 --> 01:45:46.790
Here in our presence! Dare you be so bold?

01:45:46.840 --> 01:45:50.110
Why, what tumultuous clamour have we here?

01:45:50.160 --> 01:45:53.990
The traitorous York Set all
upon us, mighty sovereign.

01:45:54.040 --> 01:45:56.710
If Somerset and Suffolk
be not done to death,

01:45:56.760 --> 01:45:59.070
Or banished fair England's territories,

01:45:59.120 --> 01:46:02.670
The people will by violence
tear them from you.

01:46:02.720 --> 01:46:05.910
I say, by them the good
Duke Humphrey died,

01:46:05.960 --> 01:46:09.440
I say, in them I fear
your highness' death.

01:46:10.960 --> 01:46:14.990
I thank the York for
thy tender loving care,

01:46:15.040 --> 01:46:18.790
For, sure, my thoughts do hourly prophesy

01:46:18.840 --> 01:46:22.190
Mischance unto my state by these lords:

01:46:22.240 --> 01:46:26.430
And therefore, by His majesty I swear,

01:46:26.480 --> 01:46:28.790
They shall not breathe
infection in this air

01:46:28.840 --> 01:46:31.430
But three days longer,
on the pain of death.

01:46:31.480 --> 01:46:34.630
Henry, let me plead for gentle Somerset!

01:46:34.680 --> 01:46:37.230
Ungentle queen, that calls him gentle!

01:46:37.280 --> 01:46:40.110
No more, I say: If thou
dost plead for them,

01:46:40.160 --> 01:46:43.460
Thou wilt but add increase unto my wrath.

01:46:44.880 --> 01:46:47.990
If, after three days'
space, thou twoest be found

01:46:48.040 --> 01:46:50.830
On any ground that I am ruler of,

01:46:50.880 --> 01:46:54.070
The world shall not be
ransom for thy life.

01:46:54.120 --> 01:46:55.630
Wise king.

01:46:55.680 --> 01:46:57.880
Banished are you both.

01:47:01.120 --> 01:47:04.350
I will repeal thee, or, be well assured,

01:47:04.400 --> 01:47:07.140
Adventure to be banished myself.

01:47:15.520 --> 01:47:17.550
I thought thou lovest me,

01:47:17.600 --> 01:47:20.590
but I see thee a puppet of these lords.

01:47:20.640 --> 01:47:24.440
Putting down banishment on
Somerset and Lord Suffolk's head.

01:47:26.840 --> 01:47:29.950
Thou break'st my heart, my lord.

01:47:30.000 --> 01:47:32.070
My love, I would not have you cry.

01:47:32.120 --> 01:47:34.320
Then reverse thy doom.

01:47:37.000 --> 01:47:38.960
I do, Meg.

01:47:40.600 --> 01:47:42.340
I do for thee.

01:47:44.920 --> 01:47:50.520
Suffolk and Somerset remain at
liberty and live thee here in peace.

01:47:51.840 --> 01:47:54.390
Suffolk at liberty.

01:47:54.440 --> 01:47:56.870
Somerset a free man.

01:47:56.920 --> 01:48:00.030
And Gloucester's bloody
trunk accusing there.

01:48:00.080 --> 01:48:01.750
False king!

01:48:01.800 --> 01:48:04.710
That head of thine doth
not become a crown,

01:48:04.760 --> 01:48:08.270
That gold should round
engirt these brows of mine.

01:48:08.320 --> 01:48:11.440
Here is a hand to hold a sceptre up.

01:48:12.800 --> 01:48:14.870
I am far better born than is the King.

01:48:14.920 --> 01:48:19.030
More like a king, more
kingly in my thoughts.

01:48:19.080 --> 01:48:20.670
Give place.

01:48:20.720 --> 01:48:22.390
Enough, York.

01:48:22.440 --> 01:48:25.270
I cannot in silence stand to watch thee,

01:48:25.320 --> 01:48:27.750
thus abuse His Majesty.

01:48:27.800 --> 01:48:30.270
We are thy sovereign, Exeter.

01:48:30.320 --> 01:48:31.910
Kneel to us.

01:48:31.960 --> 01:48:34.830
This is my king, York, I do not mistake,

01:48:34.880 --> 01:48:37.070
But thou mistakes me much to think I do.

01:48:37.120 --> 01:48:40.670
Haul him at the Tower and chop
away that factious pate of his.

01:48:40.720 --> 01:48:42.350
He is a traitor!

01:48:42.400 --> 01:48:48.320
Why, Warwick, hath thy knee forgot to bow?

01:48:50.680 --> 01:48:52.430
I have consider'd with myself

01:48:52.480 --> 01:48:54.790
The title of this most renowned duke,

01:48:54.840 --> 01:48:57.470
And in my conscience do repute his grace

01:48:57.520 --> 01:49:01.390
The rightful heir to England's royal seat.

01:49:01.440 --> 01:49:03.870
Hast thou not sworn allegiance unto me?

01:49:03.920 --> 01:49:05.270
I have.

01:49:05.320 --> 01:49:07.910
Canst thou dispense with
heaven for such an act?

01:49:07.960 --> 01:49:11.710
It is great sin to swear unto a sin,

01:49:11.760 --> 01:49:15.430
But greater sin to keep a sinful oath.

01:49:15.480 --> 01:49:20.790
Call forth our troops and
bid them arm themselves.

01:49:20.840 --> 01:49:23.710
Away, my lord, and let us prepare.

01:49:24.760 --> 01:49:28.440
We go but we'll return to wear our crown.

01:49:37.800 --> 01:49:40.990
I will stir up in England some black storm

01:49:41.040 --> 01:49:45.000
Shall blow ten thousand
souls to heaven or hell.

01:49:50.360 --> 01:49:52.110
Cecily!

01:49:52.160 --> 01:49:54.070
Cecily!

01:49:54.120 --> 01:49:55.480
Boys!

01:49:57.640 --> 01:49:59.230
Cecily, where are they?

01:49:59.280 --> 01:50:00.880
In there.

01:50:03.400 --> 01:50:06.080
Edward. George.

01:50:08.360 --> 01:50:10.040
Edmund.

01:50:12.720 --> 01:50:15.230
And...

01:50:15.280 --> 01:50:17.390
Richard!

01:50:17.440 --> 01:50:19.240
Richard!

01:50:20.305 --> 01:50:26.441
