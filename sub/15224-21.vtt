Hey, uh, you guys mind

01:25.100 --> 01:26.200
if I sit with you?

01:26.234 --> 01:27.801
You know the
rules, Louie.

01:27.834 --> 01:28.868
You're not
allowed

01:28.901 --> 01:30.167
to drink with us.
Yeah.

01:30.200 --> 01:32.100
I got a little problem
I'd like to talk over,

01:32.133 --> 01:33.767
but if that's
the way you feel.

01:33.801 --> 01:35.100
Hey, Louie, you got
a problem, Lou?

01:35.133 --> 01:36.133
Come on.
That's all right.

01:36.167 --> 01:37.133
You don't want
to hear it.

01:37.167 --> 01:38.167
Come on, Louie,
tell us

01:38.200 --> 01:39.467
about your
problem, come on.

01:39.501 --> 01:40.901
Come on, Lou.

01:40.934 --> 01:42.501
Here you go.
Come on, big...

01:42.534 --> 01:43.667
All right.

01:43.701 --> 01:44.701
I want to hear it.

01:44.734 --> 01:46.467
My problem is
I'm bored.

01:46.501 --> 01:47.634
Oh, you
are, huh?

01:47.667 --> 01:48.801
Yeah.

01:48.834 --> 01:51.167
I'm so bored, I got
nothing better to do

01:51.200 --> 01:53.701
than to sit here
and talk with you losers.

01:53.734 --> 01:56.801
That's a dirty
shame, Louie.

01:56.834 --> 01:58.934
Hey, Louie, Mr. Mackenzie
just called.

01:58.968 --> 02:01.133
He said you got to get
back to the garage right away.

02:01.167 --> 02:02.634
Sheesh!

02:02.667 --> 02:05.634
I've been gone two minutes,
and Mackenzie panics.

02:05.667 --> 02:08.133
He couldn't run
that company without me.

02:08.167 --> 02:10.133
Did he say
what the problem was?

02:10.167 --> 02:12.701
Yeah, he wants you to get him
some cigarettes.

02:12.734 --> 02:15.868
Cabs without brakes
to anybody who laughs.

02:15.901 --> 02:17.000
I mean it, Banta!

02:17.033 --> 02:19.067
One snicker and
you'll get a cab

02:19.100 --> 02:21.400
you can't stop
for a month.
( <i>stifled laugh</i> )

02:21.434 --> 02:22.834
Tony, Tony,
just think about

02:22.868 --> 02:24.467
something sad,
something awful.

02:24.501 --> 02:25.834
Yeah, like how
poor Louie

02:25.868 --> 02:27.234
has to pick up
cigarettes

02:27.267 --> 02:29.400
for the boss,
like some kind
of flunky.

02:29.434 --> 02:30.868
( <i>cackling</i> )

02:30.901 --> 02:32.267
That did it, Banta.

02:32.300 --> 02:34.567
You better pray
for green lights.

02:36.701 --> 02:38.434
TONY:
It was worth it.

02:38.467 --> 02:39.834
( <i>all laughing</i> )

02:39.868 --> 02:40.834
Rieger.

02:40.868 --> 02:41.834
Hi, Louie.

02:41.868 --> 02:42.834
Hey, Alex.

02:42.868 --> 02:43.834
How you
doing?

02:43.868 --> 02:44.834
Hey.
Hi.

02:44.868 --> 02:45.868
Another
glass,
Tommy.

02:45.901 --> 02:46.868
TOMMY:
Coming up!

02:46.901 --> 02:47.901
So, uh...

02:47.934 --> 02:49.367
how was your
latest ski weekend?

02:49.400 --> 02:51.567
Wonderful.

02:51.601 --> 02:54.434
Is that all?

02:54.467 --> 02:56.200
I'm sorry, guys, but I don't
want to talk about it.

02:56.234 --> 02:57.200
Why not?
ELAINE:
Oh!

02:57.234 --> 02:58.334
ALEX:
Because I had

02:58.367 --> 03:00.200
an experience that, um...

03:00.234 --> 03:03.200
well, it's very difficult to put
it into words, and, uh...

03:03.234 --> 03:05.567
I just... I'm afraid that
if I talk about it,

03:05.601 --> 03:08.100
it's going to make it seem
commonplace and, well,

03:08.133 --> 03:09.267
it wasn't commonplace.

03:09.300 --> 03:11.133
I mean, it was very
important to me.

03:11.167 --> 03:12.400
I mean, it was profound.

03:12.434 --> 03:13.667
It's changed me in a way

03:13.701 --> 03:15.767
that I'll never be able
to think or feel

03:15.801 --> 03:18.067
or be the same way again.

03:18.100 --> 03:20.467
Did you meet
any chicks?

03:21.834 --> 03:23.734
Alex, you know you're
going to tell us
about it eventually.

03:23.767 --> 03:25.567
And you know that
we're all waiting
to hear you tell us.

03:25.601 --> 03:27.767
Oh, please, please...
And you know
that none of us

03:27.801 --> 03:29.434
are going to talk
about anything else

03:29.467 --> 03:30.534
until you do
tell us, so...

03:30.567 --> 03:31.534
Okay.

03:31.567 --> 03:33.634
I met a girl.

03:33.667 --> 03:35.467
Right.

03:35.501 --> 03:36.934
Her name was Linda.

03:36.968 --> 03:39.901
She got the bluest eyes
I've ever seen.

03:39.934 --> 03:41.601
Anyway, we were skiing
together on Saturday,

03:41.634 --> 03:44.467
and um, she said, "Don't you
think that ski jumping

03:44.501 --> 03:46.501
is the biggest
thrill in this life?"

03:46.534 --> 03:48.934
And I said, "I don't know.
I always thought

03:48.968 --> 03:50.968
it was good for
a couple of laughs."

03:51.000 --> 03:52.934
And I mean,
somehow or
another

03:52.968 --> 03:55.667
she interpreted that to mean
that I'd done it before,

03:55.701 --> 03:58.100
so she suggested
that we go up and take a jump.

03:58.133 --> 04:00.501
I was looking at
her just like you're
looking at me.

04:00.534 --> 04:04.534
I mean, I-I didn't know what
else to say, so I said, "Okay."

04:04.567 --> 04:06.968
I mean... No, I thought someone
would come along

04:07.000 --> 04:09.067
or somebody or something
would come along

04:09.100 --> 04:10.968
to stop us before
we actually did it.

04:11.033 --> 04:14.701
Well, anyway, we started
climbing... and climbing...

04:14.734 --> 04:16.000
and climbing...

04:16.033 --> 04:17.067
and climbing...

04:17.100 --> 04:18.466
Alex, why didn't
you just tell her

04:18.500 --> 04:19.868
that you've never
done it before?

04:19.901 --> 04:23.167
Did I mention that she had the
bluest eyes I've ever seen?

04:23.200 --> 04:24.234
Say no more.

04:24.267 --> 04:26.133
Anyway,
so we get
to the top

04:26.167 --> 04:28.067
and we look down,
and I'm telling you

04:28.100 --> 04:29.267
it was straight down.

04:29.300 --> 04:32.367
I mean, just standing there
and looking, I couldn't breathe.

04:32.400 --> 04:34.567
You know, sometimes
when you get so scared

04:34.601 --> 04:36.534
you can hear your heartbeat?

04:36.567 --> 04:37.133
Yeah.

04:37.167 --> 04:38.634
She heard my heartbeat.

04:38.667 --> 04:40.467
The people down
in the lodge were saying,

04:40.501 --> 04:42.601
"What's that noise up there?"
I'm telling you!

04:42.634 --> 04:44.601
Maybe that would have been
a good time to tell her

04:44.634 --> 04:45.934
that you've never
done it before.

04:45.968 --> 04:48.300
Well, yeah, I would've,
but it's very difficult

04:48.334 --> 04:50.467
to talk and whimper
at the same time, so...

04:50.501 --> 04:52.234
So, did you go down it?

04:52.267 --> 04:54.133
Well, uh...

04:54.167 --> 04:58.567
she gave me a kiss good-bye,
and she went down.

04:58.601 --> 05:00.033
And I watched.

05:00.067 --> 05:01.200
I mean,

05:01.234 --> 05:03.801
she made a beautiful jump,
and I was up there by myself.

05:03.834 --> 05:05.734
So, I, uh, I started
to take off my skis

05:05.767 --> 05:07.434
so I can climb back down,
you know?

05:07.467 --> 05:10.067
But even that was a little
scary to me, so then, well,

05:10.100 --> 05:11.234
I said, "Wait a minute.

05:11.267 --> 05:13.067
What kind of a person am I?"

05:13.901 --> 05:15.000
I sit in my cab

05:15.033 --> 05:16.968
all my life
just driving around.

05:17.033 --> 05:19.000
You know, I've never tried
to push myself.

05:19.033 --> 05:20.367
I mean, all my life

05:20.400 --> 05:21.868
I-I've taken
the safe way.

05:21.901 --> 05:24.267
You know, I've made
the rational choice.

05:24.300 --> 05:27.234
I said, "This one time I'm going
to do the opposite."

05:27.267 --> 05:28.834
You mean you jumped?

05:28.868 --> 05:31.501
Well, you know, Tony,
the difference between going

05:31.534 --> 05:33.901
and not going
is really a very small amount.

05:33.934 --> 05:35.334
I mean, all you have to do

05:35.367 --> 05:38.000
is shift your weight forward
just the slightest bit--

05:38.033 --> 05:39.767
I mean, less than
you'd even think.

05:39.801 --> 05:43.834
Certainly less than I thought.

05:43.868 --> 05:45.267
So you decided to go?

05:45.300 --> 05:47.033
Well, I don't know if I decided,
but, uh...

05:47.067 --> 05:48.734
Maybe it was me,
maybe it was the breeze.

05:48.767 --> 05:51.100
But I went! I'm telling you,
I went straight down!

05:51.133 --> 05:53.467
I mean, the tears were streaming
back from my eyes

05:53.501 --> 05:54.734
alongside my head.

05:54.767 --> 05:57.934
The G-force was so great
it was pulling my cheeks back.

05:57.968 --> 06:00.067
I knew there was no force
on heaven and Earth

06:00.100 --> 06:02.067
that was going to stop me now,
as I went.

06:02.100 --> 06:04.868
And then... I was flying.

06:04.901 --> 06:06.300
I was flying.
TONY:
Ooh!

06:06.334 --> 06:08.834
I'm telling you, I was flying.

06:08.868 --> 06:11.601
I was so glad that I'd listened
to Jim McKay all those years,

06:11.634 --> 06:13.467
because I knew just what to do,
you know?

06:13.501 --> 06:16.100
I mean, how to keep my chin out
over the tips of my skis.

06:16.133 --> 06:17.901
But that was going to be no
small trick,

06:17.934 --> 06:20.267
because I was upside down,
I couldn't find my chin.

06:20.300 --> 06:22.033
And there I was
120 miles above

06:22.067 --> 06:24.801
Lake Placid,
and I couldn't find my chin!

06:24.834 --> 06:26.634
So how-how
did you land?

06:26.667 --> 06:28.033
You're not going
to believe this.

06:28.067 --> 06:30.033
I actually landed on my feet.
TONY:
All right!

06:30.067 --> 06:31.801
And then on my head,
and then on my back

06:31.834 --> 06:33.501
and then on my feet.

06:33.534 --> 06:35.200
By the time I came to
a complete halt,

06:35.234 --> 06:37.801
I was the biggest snowball
in the history of Lake Placid.

06:37.834 --> 06:39.167
( <i>laughs</i> )

06:39.200 --> 06:42.400
And then, when I thawed out,

06:42.434 --> 06:46.200
I found myself staring into
the bluest eyes I've ever seen.

06:46.234 --> 06:49.534
And she said,
"Boy, you got guts."

06:49.567 --> 06:50.667
BOBBY:
Oh.

06:50.701 --> 06:51.667
Wow.

06:52.968 --> 06:55.234
( <i>speaks Italian</i> )
That's some Saturday.

06:56.667 --> 06:58.801
Don't you understand?
I actually did it.

06:58.834 --> 07:01.367
I mean, that was the biggest
thrill of my life.

07:01.400 --> 07:03.667
Well...

07:03.701 --> 07:07.067
ever since that
Saturday on that ski jump,

07:07.100 --> 07:11.634
I, uh... my food has tasted
a little better,

07:11.667 --> 07:13.701
the air has smelled
a little fresher,

07:13.734 --> 07:16.400
the sky seems a little bluer,

07:16.434 --> 07:19.534
and this life has seemed
just a little bit nicer.

07:19.567 --> 07:21.234
( <i>chuckles</i> )

07:21.267 --> 07:24.901
So, I've decided...

07:24.934 --> 07:29.033
the most important thing in a
man's life is to face his fears.

07:31.834 --> 07:32.801
Tommy?

07:32.834 --> 07:33.801
TOMMY:
Yo.

07:33.834 --> 07:35.100
Set 'em up...

07:35.133 --> 07:36.467
and put it on the snowball.

07:36.501 --> 07:37.834
( <i>chuckles</i> )

07:37.868 --> 07:40.501
You know, Alex, it's-it's
like that with acting, too.

07:40.534 --> 07:41.901
It's like
the biggest thrill

07:41.934 --> 07:43.167
is when,
is when the role

07:43.200 --> 07:45.601
is so challenging
or the performance
so important

07:45.634 --> 07:47.400
that there's a chance
I could blow it

07:47.434 --> 07:48.400
and be humiliated.

07:48.434 --> 07:49.501
Right.
TONY:
Hey, maybe

07:49.534 --> 07:51.067
that's why
boxing's so
thrilling.

07:51.100 --> 07:52.200
Every time I
go in the ring,

07:52.234 --> 07:53.634
I got a shot at
being humiliated.

07:53.667 --> 07:54.234
( <i>Elaine laughs</i> )

07:54.267 --> 07:56.267
And of being
badly injured.

07:56.300 --> 07:59.734
Yeah, sounds like you got
the best of both worlds.

07:59.767 --> 08:01.634
I guess that's why
it's so exciting.

08:01.667 --> 08:02.901
I mean, let
me tell you,

08:02.934 --> 08:04.934
every time you
step in that ring,

08:04.968 --> 08:06.434
you're testing
yourself.

08:06.467 --> 08:07.701
Say that again, Tony.

08:07.734 --> 08:09.667
What did I say?

08:09.701 --> 08:10.701
ALEX:
Hey, Tony?

08:12.234 --> 08:13.734
I want to learn
how to box.

08:13.767 --> 08:14.834
Oh, come on, Alex.
BOBBY:
What?

08:14.868 --> 08:15.901
ALEX:
No, no, no,
I-I mean it.

08:17.033 --> 08:18.200
Would you
teach me?

08:18.234 --> 08:19.234
Sure.

08:19.267 --> 08:20.901
How about tomorrow?

08:20.934 --> 08:22.501
Tomorrow's fine.
Great!

08:22.534 --> 08:23.801
Oh, I get what you're doing.
I mean,

08:23.834 --> 08:25.534
you didn't kill yourself enough
on the slopes,

08:25.567 --> 08:26.901
so now you want
to do it in the ring.

08:26.934 --> 08:28.033
No, you don't understand.

08:28.067 --> 08:29.934
You see, getting hit
has been one of my fears.

08:29.968 --> 08:30.934
TONY:
Yeah, I know.

08:30.968 --> 08:32.100
And I want
to confront it.

08:32.133 --> 08:33.366
Listen to how you're talking.

08:33.400 --> 08:34.767
I mean, what's
going on with you?

08:34.801 --> 08:35.767
I don't know!

08:35.801 --> 08:37.801
But ever since that jump
on Saturday,

08:37.833 --> 08:40.467
I understand what Hemingway
was talking about.

08:41.433 --> 08:43.000
Every man has fears,

08:43.033 --> 08:46.367
but those who face
their fears with dignity

08:46.400 --> 08:48.534
have courage, as well.

08:48.567 --> 08:50.267
For instance, that piano.

08:50.300 --> 08:55.200
You're going to ski
off that piano?

to myself, you know?

you doing?

Be honest with me.

12:06.834 --> 12:08.400
I'll tell you the truth, Alex.
You know, you got

12:08.434 --> 12:10.267
good boxing instincts,
and you got great reflexes, too.

12:10.300 --> 12:11.334
Really?
Yeah, really.

Hey, come on, let's just forget
about this break.

12:13.133 --> 12:14.400
Let's get back
in the ring and spar.

12:14.434 --> 12:16.334
I want to do some more

12:16.367 --> 12:17.634
Oh, no, Alex, I don't think
you're ready

for that kind of sparring
with a professional.

12:19.167 --> 12:20.400
I'll right, I'll settle
for an amateur.

12:20.434 --> 12:22.300
Must be one in the gym
who'd spar with me.

Oh, yeah, I guess
you could try him.

12:24.400 --> 12:25.767
He any good?

12:25.801 --> 12:27.434
No, but he's safe.

12:27.467 --> 12:29.133
No, Tony, I
don't want safe.

12:29.167 --> 12:30.133
The idea is
to get in there

12:30.167 --> 12:31.200
with someone
who isn't safe.

12:31.234 --> 12:32.434

somebody else.

No, man, no,
I want him.

12:41.701 --> 12:43.501
Is he an amateur?

12:43.534 --> 12:45.834
Yeah, a good amateur.

12:47.334 --> 12:48.968
Bring him on.
Alex, I'm
telling you...

12:49.000 --> 12:50.467
I can't let you do
this, it's dangerous.

12:50.501 --> 12:52.267
No, I just want to go
one round with the guy.

12:52.300 --> 12:53.934
Just one round.
I'll stay away from him.

12:53.968 --> 12:55.934
Just one round.
Look, I just want
the thrill

12:55.968 --> 12:57.234
of being in the
ring with a guy

12:57.267 --> 12:58.801
who's looking to knock
my head off...

12:58.834 --> 12:59.834
and who could.

12:59.868 --> 13:01.133
Alex, I understand
that feeling,

13:01.167 --> 13:02.634
but this guy
could break your jaw...

13:02.667 --> 13:05.567
Tony, Tony,
just one round.
I got to do this.

with my buddy?

13:17.868 --> 13:20.334
Sure.

Carl, I'm talking
one round, man,

13:21.834 --> 13:23.200
no more,
and I'm gonna time it.

13:23.234 --> 13:24.267
And take it
easy on him,

'cause he's
new at this.

Hey, hey, forget that
"take it easy" stuff!

Now, wait a minute.
No, I'm going to go all out,

the same thing.

on me, though, you know.

on the guy.

to the head, Al.

14:59.234 --> 15:00.968
Would that have knocked
out a good boxer?

It would have knocked
out a rhinoceros.

18:21.067 --> 18:23.300
( <i>chuckles</i> )
I heard it's
wonderful...

18:23.334 --> 18:24.634
wonderful!
Right here!

18:24.667 --> 18:25.934
Don't you think
it's a little odd

18:25.968 --> 18:26.934
that your beneficiary

18:26.968 --> 18:28.000
wants you
to do this?

18:28.033 --> 18:30.234
Come on, get
out of here!

18:30.267 --> 18:32.133
Who's going
with me?

18:32.167 --> 18:34.634
Who's going with me?

18:40.167 --> 18:42.634
How-how-how much
more time?

18:42.667 --> 18:43.834
A couple
of minutes.

18:43.868 --> 18:45.200
Oh.

19:00.868 --> 19:03.734
Okay, time to prepare
for the jump.

19:05.567 --> 19:06.667
I'm nervous.

19:06.701 --> 19:08.667
It's... it's okay, Alex.
I'm nervous, too,

19:08.701 --> 19:11.400
and I'm not even
jumping, thank God.

19:11.434 --> 19:13.868
Oh, I... it just
slipped out.
I'm sorry.

19:13.901 --> 19:16.834
Hey, it's normal to be
nervous first time out.

19:16.868 --> 19:18.968
Sure it is,
sure it is.

19:19.000 --> 19:21.000
You got nothing
to worry about.

19:22.300 --> 19:24.234
Just what do
you think his
chances are?

19:24.267 --> 19:26.934
Louie, sit down
and shut up.

19:26.968 --> 19:29.367
INSTRUCTOR:
It's such a beautiful
day for a jump.

19:29.400 --> 19:31.267
Just do everything
exactly as you did

19:31.300 --> 19:32.567
in ground school.

19:32.601 --> 19:33.868
Everything's going
to be fine.

19:33.901 --> 19:37.000
Believe me, you're
going to love it.

19:37.033 --> 19:39.067
Just wish I were jumping today.

19:39.100 --> 19:40.501
How come
you're not?

19:40.534 --> 19:43.968
Last time I jumped,
I injured my spleen.

19:46.501 --> 19:49.934
Soon as I'm able, though,
I'll be jumping again.

19:49.968 --> 19:51.567
It's that
good, huh?

19:51.601 --> 19:53.200
Oh, it's better than sex.

19:53.234 --> 19:54.968
It's better than <i>most</i> sex.

19:55.000 --> 19:57.200
Listen, uh, maybe we can, uh,
get together

19:57.234 --> 20:00.300
and compare some notes and do
some persuading, you know.

20:00.334 --> 20:01.434
I take a lot of
persuading.

20:01.467 --> 20:02.968
Well, just give me
some time, and...

20:03.000 --> 20:04.634
ALEX:
Hey, Bobby, will you
cut that out?

20:04.667 --> 20:06.701
Can't you wait
till I'm gone?
Till I've jumped?

20:06.734 --> 20:08.868
You're right...

20:08.901 --> 20:11.300
All right,
you ready, Mr. Rieger?

20:11.334 --> 20:13.767
Huh? Ready?
For what?

20:13.801 --> 20:15.067
Oh... oh, yeah...

20:15.100 --> 20:17.334
I guess so.

20:19.033 --> 20:21.000
Okay, Alex,
we're all with you.

20:21.033 --> 20:22.868
( <i>grunts</i> )

20:24.968 --> 20:26.567
That's it...

20:26.601 --> 20:27.567
Okay.

20:27.601 --> 20:29.267
ALEX:
Oh. my God.

20:29.300 --> 20:32.000
INSTRUCTOR:
We're almost over the jump
area, so let's get set.

20:32.033 --> 20:33.334
Get you hooked up.

20:33.367 --> 20:35.267
BOBBY:
Just hooking him up.

20:35.300 --> 20:37.000
You know what just
occurred to me,

20:37.033 --> 20:39.400
sitting here with the
breeze blowing in my face

20:39.434 --> 20:41.000
and my adrenaline
pumping me up

20:41.033 --> 20:42.901
to do what few men
will ever attempt?

20:42.934 --> 20:44.767
What's that, Alex?

20:44.801 --> 20:46.667
I'm not going down there.
I'm not going down there.

20:46.701 --> 20:47.667
I'm not going to go.

20:47.701 --> 20:48.834
But Alex!
I'm not go... Ah!

20:48.868 --> 20:51.033
What about the single most
greatest thrill in your life?

20:51.067 --> 20:52.467
( <i>screams</i> )

20:52.501 --> 20:54.367
Oh, no, I don't
want to go.
All right, okay, Alex?

20:54.400 --> 20:55.534
Okay, Alex, you don't
have to go

20:55.567 --> 20:57.367
if you don't want to--
you don't have to.
No...?

20:57.400 --> 20:59.300
Here, here,
I'll-I'll handle this.

21:02.000 --> 21:02.968
Alex?

21:03.000 --> 21:04.067
What?

21:04.100 --> 21:05.434
A man's got to do

21:05.467 --> 21:07.234
what a man's got to do.

21:07.267 --> 21:08.334
( <i>yells</i> )

21:08.367 --> 21:10.234
Louie, Louie...!

21:10.267 --> 21:11.767
( <i>shudders</i> )

21:11.801 --> 21:13.767
All right, all right,
look, look, Rieger?

21:13.801 --> 21:15.033
Yeah, what?

21:15.067 --> 21:18.067
I'm not trying to
force you into anything.

21:18.100 --> 21:19.767
I just want you to know--

21:19.801 --> 21:23.000
so that you don't get
the wrong idea here--

21:23.033 --> 21:24.934
this is very
hard for me to say,

21:24.968 --> 21:28.033
but I just want you to know
what kind of guy I am.

21:28.067 --> 21:34.567
I got $50,000 riding on this,
and I still hope you don't die.

21:35.701 --> 21:38.701
I hope you're not waiting
for applause, Louie.

21:38.734 --> 21:41.300
INSTRUCTOR:
If you're going,
Mr. Rieger,

21:41.334 --> 21:44.234
it's got
to be now.

21:45.601 --> 21:47.534
Alex, Alex, you don't
have to do this

21:47.567 --> 21:48.934
if you don't want to.

21:48.968 --> 21:51.567
Nobody's going to think
any less of you.

21:52.801 --> 21:55.501
Nobody but me.

21:58.400 --> 22:01.767
Geronimo-o-o...

22:01.801 --> 22:05.067
o-o-oh...

22:09.667 --> 22:10.667
Alex?

22:10.701 --> 22:11.767
What?

22:11.801 --> 22:13.000
You're still here.

22:13.033 --> 22:15.133
I am? I could
swear I jumped.

22:15.167 --> 22:16.167
My spirit jumped.

22:16.200 --> 22:18.434
It's just my body
that's left here.

22:21.767 --> 22:24.400
Ah, what the hell?

22:24.434 --> 22:26.767
( <i>screaming</i> )

22:26.801 --> 22:28.133
I'm going to die!

22:28.167 --> 22:29.534
I'm going to die.

22:29.567 --> 22:30.934
I'm going to die!

22:30.968 --> 22:33.234
I'm going to die...

22:33.267 --> 22:34.667
ohh...

22:35.701 --> 22:36.734
It opened.

22:36.767 --> 22:37.901
The chute opened.

22:37.934 --> 22:41.067
I'm not going to die.

22:41.100 --> 22:43.801
I'm not going to die;
I'm going to live.

22:43.834 --> 22:46.067
I'm going to live.

22:46.100 --> 22:47.868
* Oh, life is good 

22:47.901 --> 22:49.534
* Life is wonderful... 

22:49.567 --> 22:51.167
And I'm going to throw up.

22:51.200 --> 22:53.267
I'm going to...
I'm going to spend

22:53.300 --> 22:57.033
the single greatest thrill
of my life throwing up.

22:57.067 --> 22:59.300
No, hold it, hold it,
I'm going to be okay.

22:59.334 --> 23:01.067
It passed,
it's going to be okay.

23:01.100 --> 23:03.200
Oh, my God, look at this,
it's incredible.

23:03.234 --> 23:04.801
I feel like... I feel like...

23:04.834 --> 23:06.501
like...

23:06.534 --> 23:09.667
* Being alive 

23:09.701 --> 23:12.834
* Being alive... 

23:12.868 --> 23:17.300
* Being ali-i-ve... 

23:17.334 --> 23:19.901
( <i>laughing</i> )

23:24.000 --> 23:26.367
...and you feel
small, fragile

23:26.400 --> 23:28.968
but also
strangely
invincible,

23:29.000 --> 23:32.701
as if you're no longer a part of
that miniature world below you,

23:32.734 --> 23:34.601
because you've just
separated yourself

23:34.634 --> 23:36.234
from reality
for the moment...

23:36.267 --> 23:38.167
( <i>snoring</i> )
...by diving
from that plane

23:38.200 --> 23:39.434
and plunging
toward Earth

23:39.467 --> 23:41.100
in defiance of
your own mortality.

23:41.133 --> 23:43.467
I mean, it's
all dreamlike.

23:43.501 --> 23:45.000
Nothing real
can touch you

23:45.033 --> 23:47.000
as you float
in your reverie...

 <i>not wanting to understand it,</i>
