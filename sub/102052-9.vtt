00:14.973 --> 00:17.308
<i>[Ruth] </i>Hope is a powerful thing.

00:17.976 --> 00:19.936
<i>Melanie used it to unite the people,</i>

00:20.520 --> 00:21.688
<i>first with a lie.</i>

00:22.272 --> 00:25.233
<i>But then with the promise</i>
<i>of a life off of </i>Snowpiercer.

00:27.902 --> 00:31.031
<i>Andre Layton used hope</i>
<i>to inspire his people</i>

00:31.114 --> 00:32.532
<i>to fight for their freedom.</i>

00:34.451 --> 00:36.077
<i>But look where that's got him.</i>

00:38.371 --> 00:41.541
<i>And Mr. Wilford, he's a different story.</i>

00:42.459 --> 00:44.961
<i>He's turned hope into fear.</i>

00:46.046 --> 00:50.133
<i>He's turned the train against itself,</i>
<i>and then offered security.</i>

00:53.720 --> 00:56.181
<i>The funny thing is, since he took control,</i>

00:56.264 --> 00:58.683
<i>everything appears to be running smoothly.</i>

01:08.109 --> 01:09.486
<i>Everyone is showing up for work.</i>

01:10.320 --> 01:12.405
<i>The supply lines are a picture of order.</i>

01:17.494 --> 01:19.037
<i>But we've been here before.</i>

01:21.331 --> 01:22.874
<i>[Jackboot] Hey! Hand those over.</i>

01:24.292 --> 01:26.419
<i>-Let's move. Let's go!</i>
<i>-Jack, get in here.</i>

01:26.503 --> 01:29.047
<i>[Ruth] </i>My own hope, I keep hidden.

01:29.839 --> 01:31.257
<i>[indistinct chatter]</i>

01:31.341 --> 01:33.968
<i>Hidden in the few people</i>
<i>who can rekindle it.</i>

01:34.636 --> 01:35.887
<i>[Jackboot 1] Did we get everything?</i>

01:37.138 --> 01:39.516
<i>I've got nothing more</i>
<i>on Roche or his family.</i>

01:40.100 --> 01:41.976
<i>[Jackboot 2] Okay,</i>
<i>load up and move. Let's go.</i>

01:43.645 --> 01:45.105
<i>Wilford sent for me.</i>

01:46.773 --> 01:48.149
<i>[Till] You better come inside.</i>

01:50.068 --> 01:52.612
<i>You all right? Any message</i>
<i>from our friends downtrain?</i>

01:53.279 --> 01:56.699
<i>They have the same info,</i>
<i>that Andre's in </i>Big Alice<i> Compost.</i>

01:56.783 --> 01:59.202
<i>-They call it "The Swamp."</i>
<i>-[sighs]</i>

01:59.285 --> 02:01.121
<i>Any idea what Wilford wants from me?</i>

02:02.163 --> 02:03.623
<i>-I'll try and find out.</i>
<i>-Okay.</i>

02:03.706 --> 02:06.709
<i>He's got me up to my eyeballs</i>
<i>planning a special evening.</i>

02:08.044 --> 02:10.630
<i>Good friend Audrey</i>
<i>probably told him all about us.</i>

02:10.713 --> 02:12.423
<i>I can't believe she fell for his shit.</i>

02:12.966 --> 02:15.426
<i>At least she's got the sense</i>
<i>not to show her face.</i>

02:17.470 --> 02:20.390
<i>Look, the way to survive Mr. Wilford,</i>

02:20.974 --> 02:23.226
<i>you've just gotta be</i>
<i>something that he needs.</i>

02:24.060 --> 02:25.311
<i>You keep your chin up.</i>

02:26.229 --> 02:27.147
<i>Yes, ma'am.</i>

02:29.274 --> 02:33.361
<i>[Ruth] </i>Mr. Wilford's order
comes at a very high price.

02:33.945 --> 02:36.364
<i>And I just know</i>
<i>that something awful is coming.</i>

02:38.032 --> 02:42.579
<i>On </i>Snowpiercer, <i>1,034 cars long.</i>

02:43.204 --> 02:44.998
<i>[theme music playing]</i>

03:01.222 --> 03:03.391
<i>How are</i>
<i>the evening's festivities coming on?</i>

03:03.474 --> 03:04.934
<i>[Ruth] Right on schedule, sir.</i>

03:05.018 --> 03:07.729
<i>-Might I ask, is there a guest list?</i>
<i>-Mmm-hmm.</i>

03:08.938 --> 03:11.399
<i>Ah, yes, random winners.</i>

03:12.233 --> 03:13.526
<i>That's Kevin's domain.</i>

03:14.569 --> 03:17.697
<i>He's in charge</i>
<i>of a special surprise today.</i>

03:17.780 --> 03:20.158
<i>Oh, what kind of surprise?</i>

03:21.618 --> 03:24.787
<i>One for the whole train</i>
<i>to celebrate rightful leadership.</i>

03:24.871 --> 03:26.623
<i>[Wilford] Take some time off, Ruth.</i>

03:26.706 --> 03:28.249
<i>So you can enjoy some of it, too.</i>

03:28.958 --> 03:31.794
<i>But first, I have</i>
<i>a job for the both of you.</i>

03:32.670 --> 03:34.589
<i>Both of us, uh, together?</i>

03:35.465 --> 03:37.675
<i>Snowpiercer</i> is getting muddy.

03:37.759 --> 03:39.135
<i>All the classes mixed up and down.</i>

03:39.219 --> 03:40.136
<i>What a mess.</i>

03:40.220 --> 03:41.971
<i>Well, you're to begin a full census.</i>

03:42.055 --> 03:44.390
<i>I want the passengers</i>
<i>organized like in the old days.</i>

03:45.099 --> 03:48.353
<i>I want to know who is where, doing what.</i>

03:48.436 --> 03:49.270
<i>[Kevin] Yes, sir.</i>

03:49.854 --> 03:50.813
<i>Yes, sir.</i>

03:51.397 --> 03:53.399
<i>[Javi] He'll change everything around now.</i>

03:53.483 --> 03:56.444
<i>Wilford wants resiliency.</i>
<i>I hate that word.</i>

03:57.153 --> 03:59.280
<i>He wants to keep us apart.</i>

03:59.364 --> 04:03.534
<i>Remember, they're gonna be monitoring</i>
<i>everything we say between the Engines.</i>

04:04.118 --> 04:04.994
<i>You're gonna be okay.</i>

04:05.078 --> 04:08.623
<i>Yeah, until when?</i>
<i>What if he throws me in The Swamp?</i>

04:08.706 --> 04:10.291
<i>He's picking us off one by one.</i>

04:11.834 --> 04:13.920
<i>He can't afford to lose another Engineer.</i>

04:20.218 --> 04:22.637
<i>I need you to keep</i>
<i>pushing this train forward.</i>

04:22.720 --> 04:24.430
<i>We're a week away from picking Melanie up.</i>

04:24.514 --> 04:26.099
<i>-Yeah, if she's there.</i>
<i>-She'll be there.</i>

04:26.182 --> 04:29.602
<i>We're already a day late.</i>
<i>We lost contact with her over a week ago.</i>

04:29.686 --> 04:32.397
<i>But Wilford doesn't know that. Does he?</i>

04:33.356 --> 04:34.399
<i>We keep it that way.</i>

04:34.482 --> 04:35.650
<i>[sighs]</i>

04:35.733 --> 04:37.360
<i>Get her home safe.</i>

04:37.443 --> 04:39.445
<i>That's the mission. No questions.</i>

04:40.405 --> 04:41.906
<i>-All right.</i>
<i>-[man] Come on, let's go.</i>

04:49.205 --> 04:52.166
<i>[speaking Spanish]</i>

05:03.344 --> 05:04.637
<i>What's the big surprise, Kevin?</i>

05:04.721 --> 05:07.056
<i>Sooner we get the census going,</i>
<i>the sooner you'll find out.</i>

05:07.140 --> 05:08.766
<i>Oh, come on,</i>
<i>I know you're dying to tell me.</i>

05:08.850 --> 05:10.852
<i>Sorry, sworn to secrecy.</i>

05:10.935 --> 05:13.313
<i>-You know how he is.</i>
<i>-[laughs sarcastically]</i>

05:15.857 --> 05:17.066
<i>What is all of this?</i>

05:18.568 --> 05:21.070
<i>Patients' records.</i>
<i>Took them right out of my clinic.</i>

05:23.406 --> 05:25.950
<i>These are not passenger files,</i>
<i>these are medical records.</i>

05:26.034 --> 05:28.786
<i>-Supposed to be confidential.</i>
<i>-He wants them divided by age.</i>

05:28.870 --> 05:31.664
<i>Children, adolescents,</i>
<i>18 to 39. The rest, elderly.</i>

05:32.248 --> 05:35.251
<i>"Elderly"? Dear me.</i>

05:35.335 --> 05:36.961
<i>What's all this in aid of, Kevin?</i>

05:37.837 --> 05:39.797
<i>I guess he wants</i>
<i>to see who's fit for what.</i>

05:39.881 --> 05:42.675
<i>Sample questionnaire</i>
<i>for each of the passengers to fill out.</i>

05:44.218 --> 05:45.887
<i>"Are you an unticketed passenger?"</i>

05:45.970 --> 05:48.806
<i>"Are you aware of any passengers</i>
<i>who fought with the rebels?"</i>

05:48.890 --> 05:50.183
<i>[Kevin] That's for the archives.</i>

05:50.266 --> 05:54.062
<i>Matter of historical record.</i>
<i>I'll tell him you're displeased, though.</i>

05:54.979 --> 05:56.439
<i>No, Kevin, you won't.</i>

05:56.522 --> 05:59.692
<i>I'll have my own conversations</i>
<i>with Mr. Wilford, thank you very much.</i>

06:02.528 --> 06:04.530
<i>I know every passenger on this train</i>

06:04.614 --> 06:07.241
<i>and I consider myself</i>
<i>responsible for each of them.</i>

06:07.325 --> 06:08.659
<i>How unpleasant.</i>

06:10.995 --> 06:13.748
<i>I care about these passengers, Kevin.</i>
<i>That's a warning.</i>

06:13.831 --> 06:16.542
<i>We'll be back tomorrow</i>
<i>for your questionnaires.</i>

06:23.216 --> 06:24.675
<i>[man] Hey, keep movin'.</i>

06:31.349 --> 06:32.266
<i>Alex.</i>

06:32.350 --> 06:34.018
<i>I know. I'm Javier. Javi.</i>

06:35.853 --> 06:38.564
<i>The Fifth Engineer. Sit.</i>

06:42.443 --> 06:44.946
<i>Please don't touch anything</i>
<i>unless I tell you to.</i>

06:49.409 --> 06:50.535
<i>[Javi] That panel is new, no?</i>

06:50.618 --> 06:54.622
<i>It's not new, it's overhauled. I upgraded</i>
<i>the interface on the second Revolution.</i>

06:57.959 --> 06:59.919
<i>Please don't touch anything.</i>

07:04.340 --> 07:06.676
<i>It's from </i>Snowpiercer.
<i>It's a joke from your mom.</i>

07:06.759 --> 07:08.594
<i>I had it there for years.</i>
<i>I thought you'd like--</i>

07:08.678 --> 07:09.720
<i>Don't butter me up. Okay?</i>

07:09.804 --> 07:12.598
<i>Wilford tapped you as an Engineer,</i>
<i>you're gonna stick to that.</i>

07:21.899 --> 07:22.984
<i>You know,</i>

07:24.360 --> 07:26.529
<i>when your mom came back from here,</i>

07:26.612 --> 07:28.573
<i>she said</i>
<i>you weren't just technically good.</i>

07:29.115 --> 07:30.783
<i>She said you had the touch.</i>

07:31.993 --> 07:33.744
<i>Well, do you have the touch?</i>

07:36.205 --> 07:37.206
<i>[speaking Spanish]</i>

07:37.290 --> 07:39.292
<i>-Not like your mom.</i>
<i>-Just keep us on the track.</i>

07:39.375 --> 07:40.334
<i>Okay. Where you going?</i>

07:40.418 --> 07:43.296
<i>Uptrain. It's a big day on </i>Snowpiercer.

07:43.379 --> 07:45.006
<i>Sorry you're not invited.</i>

07:52.305 --> 07:53.806
<i>Brought her up from </i>Big Alice.

07:55.099 --> 07:56.642
<i>One of my favorites.</i>

07:56.726 --> 07:59.312
<i>You see how their bodies are entwined?</i>

07:59.395 --> 08:02.773
<i>You can't tell whether they're fighting</i>
<i>or… well, you know.</i>

08:03.441 --> 08:05.234
<i>What do you think, Bess Till?</i>

08:05.318 --> 08:09.238
<i>I think a lot of the passengers are</i>
<i>concerned that people keep disappearing.</i>

08:09.322 --> 08:10.531
<i>Layton…</i>

08:11.199 --> 08:12.992
<i>And now Brakeman Roche and his family.</i>

08:16.954 --> 08:20.291
<i>You're a curious creature.</i>
<i>I don't know what to do with you.</i>

08:20.374 --> 08:23.544
<i>With eight of</i>
<i>our Breachmen murdered, I could, uh…</i>

08:24.504 --> 08:27.548
<i>find the killers, close the case.</i>

08:29.300 --> 08:31.427
<i>You see, Train Detective</i>
<i>is a Melanie invention.</i>

08:31.511 --> 08:33.804
<i>-I never needed one. Do you know why?</i>
<i>-No, sir.</i>

08:33.888 --> 08:36.140
<i>Because there wasn't</i>
<i>any crime on my train.</i>

08:36.224 --> 08:38.935
<i>There is no crime. Only order.</i>

08:39.018 --> 08:40.228
<i>I don't think you're that naive.</i>

08:43.481 --> 08:46.108
<i>And I don't think you're that innocent.</i>

08:48.528 --> 08:52.698
<i>[laughs] Very well. You can tell</i>
<i>the passengers Mr. Roche is in a Drawer,</i>

08:52.782 --> 08:54.200
<i>along with his family.</i>

08:55.243 --> 08:57.370
<i>When you all settle down,</i>

08:57.453 --> 08:58.704
<i>they can rejoin us.</i>

08:59.830 --> 09:01.249
<i>That won't go over well.</i>

09:01.332 --> 09:04.835
<i>I know, but I have just the tonic.</i>

09:06.546 --> 09:10.174
<i>Sykes, take her down to Car 272.</i>

09:11.801 --> 09:15.930
<i>And don't worry about Mr. Layton.</i>
<i>We've made him quite at home.</i>

09:16.013 --> 09:17.390
<i>[machine whirring]</i>

10:10.735 --> 10:13.654
<i>Now, I know you're just</i>
<i>following Wilford's order.</i>

10:13.738 --> 10:16.115
<i>But I have a right to know</i>
<i>what you've done to me.</i>

10:17.116 --> 10:18.492
<i>You found out prematurely.</i>

10:18.576 --> 10:23.289
<i>Yeah. I put my hand</i>
<i>in the Cold Lock and it didn't fall off.</i>

10:23.372 --> 10:24.707
<i>What does he want with me?</i>

10:24.790 --> 10:25.916
<i>Please…</i>

10:28.169 --> 10:29.629
<i>When you arrived with us…</i>

10:30.880 --> 10:33.841
<i>You don't need to show me that.</i>
<i>I lived through every second of it.</i>

10:33.924 --> 10:35.760
<i>We repaired you.</i>

10:36.344 --> 10:38.554
<i>Yes. Thank you.</i>

10:38.638 --> 10:40.097
<i>You took the pain away.</i>

10:40.681 --> 10:44.477
<i>But you have done something</i>
<i>to my body without my consent!</i>

10:44.560 --> 10:45.978
<i>-Honey…</i>
<i>-Josie…</i>

10:47.521 --> 10:52.068
<i>What did it feel like</i>
<i>when you put your hand in the chamber?</i>

10:52.151 --> 10:53.527
<i>[breathing heavily]</i>

10:58.324 --> 11:00.910
<i>It was a rush, wasn't it?</i>

11:07.083 --> 11:09.835
<i>I didn't sign up to be the next Icy Bob.</i>

11:09.919 --> 11:12.838
<i>You're orders of magnitude beyond our Bob.</i>

11:12.922 --> 11:14.507
<i>[Mrs. Headwood] You want to know more?</i>

11:15.341 --> 11:16.926
<i>Let's see what's possible.</i>

11:22.223 --> 11:23.182
<i>[Ruth] Oh, for Pete's sake!</i>

11:23.265 --> 11:25.851
<i>-Slow down, Kevin!</i>
<i>-Ruth, this is the big surprise!</i>

11:26.852 --> 11:28.270
<i>He's opening Car 272.</i>

11:28.354 --> 11:30.147
<i>And he's putting </i>me<i> in charge.</i>

11:30.231 --> 11:32.441
<i>Car 272 has been closed for years.</i>

11:32.525 --> 11:33.901
<i>-Wait!</i>
<i>-[gasps]</i>

11:33.984 --> 11:34.860
<i>[Kevin] I need a kid.</i>

11:36.821 --> 11:37.697
<i>Come here.</i>

11:38.322 --> 11:40.658
<i>Come on. Come on.</i>

11:40.741 --> 11:41.617
<i>Let's go.</i>

11:42.576 --> 11:43.953
<i>Come on, Winnie, it's all right.</i>

11:55.297 --> 11:57.800
<i>-[carnival music playing]</i>
<i>-[clown laughing]</i>

12:19.238 --> 12:21.240
<i>Oh, my goodness.</i>

12:21.323 --> 12:23.534
<i>Ta-da! He'll be here in a jiff.</i>

12:23.617 --> 12:25.077
<i>The grand opening is tonight!</i>

12:26.287 --> 12:27.121
<i>Ah!</i>

12:28.122 --> 12:30.916
<i>Sit. Stay.</i>

12:31.000 --> 12:32.168
<i>[both laughing]</i>

12:32.251 --> 12:34.044
<i>Hey! Hey, hey, hey!</i>

12:34.128 --> 12:35.921
<i>Those aren't for teenagers.</i>

12:36.005 --> 12:38.966
<i>Alex! Alex, don't be ridiculous. Get down.</i>

12:39.049 --> 12:41.927
<i>Wilford put Roche</i>
<i>and his family in the Drawers.</i>

12:42.636 --> 12:45.723
<i>Roche in a Drawer, Javi on </i>Big Alice,

12:45.806 --> 12:47.641
<i>and Layton's in his Compost.</i>

12:47.725 --> 12:49.685
<i>And now this shitshow?</i>

12:50.936 --> 12:54.815
<i>Oh, okay. Here it comes.</i>
<i>Tech rehearsal's starting.</i>

12:55.399 --> 12:56.650
<i>Everybody, up, up, up!</i>

13:21.634 --> 13:23.969
<i>-[Kevin] Bravo! What an entrance!</i>
<i>-[LJ] Mr. Wilford!</i>

13:24.053 --> 13:25.054
<i>[Wilford] Wonderful.</i>

13:25.137 --> 13:26.680
<i>That was really good.</i>

13:27.306 --> 13:28.516
<i>Perfect timing.</i>

13:29.099 --> 13:30.768
<i>-It's marvelous, isn't it?</i>
<i>-Yeah.</i>

13:30.851 --> 13:32.770
<i>Ah, don't like that. Get rid of it.</i>

13:32.853 --> 13:35.397
<i>Fly in the stage</i>
<i>for the puppeteers. There we go!</i>

13:35.481 --> 13:38.943
<i>-[Kevin] Come along! Be seated.</i>
<i>-[Wilford] Gather round! Special preview.</i>

13:39.026 --> 13:40.945
<i>An epic saga for the masses.</i>

13:42.530 --> 13:43.364
<i>Ah.</i>

13:47.326 --> 13:49.036

<i>[Layton] Yeah, it does.</i>

21:28.328 --> 21:30.080
<i>[Wilford] Well,</i>
<i>for the life of me, I can't see how.</i>

21:31.748 --> 21:34.960
<i>I suppose there must be</i>

21:35.752 --> 21:37.212
<i>You're not unique, Wilford.</i>

<i>When that washes off, it's a wrap for you.</i>

22:03.572 --> 22:05.032
<i>You'll always have your little followers,</i>

22:05.115 --> 22:08.035
<i>but the majority</i>

<i>Every little faction…</i>

28:01.721 --> 28:03.306
<i>She wanted to be you.</i>

28:04.015 --> 28:06.267
<i>She accused me of a crime,</i>

28:06.351 --> 28:08.478
<i>and I found out her little secret,</i>

28:08.561 --> 28:10.397
<i>so she had to overturn the verdict.</i>

28:17.445 --> 28:19.030
<i>I'm puzzled, LJ.</i>

28:19.864 --> 28:22.659
<i>If Melanie overturned the verdict,</i>

28:24.202 --> 28:25.787
<i>does that mean you were guilty?</i>

28:31.751 --> 28:32.961
<i>[LJ] I, uh…</i>

28:36.131 --> 28:36.965
<i>Uh, no.</i>

28:37.048 --> 28:40.510
<i>So, you did not cut off</i>
<i>those men's penises</i>

28:41.094 --> 28:42.804
<i>like I read about in the transcripts.</i>

28:44.389 --> 28:46.891
<i>-I am so relieved.</i>
<i>-[laughs]</i>

28:47.642 --> 28:48.977
<i>Is that true, Lilah?</i>

28:49.060 --> 28:51.146
<i>-Lilah Junior is a good person.</i>
<i>-Yes, I know.</i>

28:51.229 --> 28:53.356
<i>She fell far from First</i>
<i>when her parents passed.</i>

28:53.440 --> 28:56.693
<i>She learned to work, sir. She knows</i>
<i>the train now, and I'm proud of her.</i>

28:56.776 --> 28:59.404
<i>He speaks. [laughs]</i>

28:59.988 --> 29:02.365
<i>Osweiller from the East Midlands.</i>

29:03.241 --> 29:06.453
<i>You're even quieter</i>
<i>than your partner, Trusty Till.</i>

29:07.120 --> 29:09.873
<i>Although a little more romantic, huh?</i>

29:12.167 --> 29:14.127
<i>My intentions</i>
<i>with Lilah Junior are sound, sir.</i>

29:14.210 --> 29:16.171
<i>How lovely. Did you hear that, Audrey?</i>

29:16.254 --> 29:17.922
<i>Yeah, and he meant it.</i>

29:18.673 --> 29:23.094
<i>Tell me, Mr. Osweiller.</i>
<i>My previous Head of Janitorial, Terence,</i>

29:23.762 --> 29:26.139
<i>I brought from my buildings in New York.</i>

29:26.222 --> 29:29.184
<i>How did you come to be in his shoes?</i>

29:29.267 --> 29:31.352
<i>Sir, those were chaotic times.</i>

29:31.436 --> 29:35.106
<i>We lost a lot of people in the troubles.</i>
<i>We've tried to fill in as best we could.</i>

29:36.065 --> 29:37.150
<i>Simple question.</i>

29:37.817 --> 29:42.197
<i>For an AWOL Brakeman and a girl</i>
<i>who put out her father's eye with a fork…</i>

29:43.907 --> 29:46.743
<i>Think very carefully</i>
<i>about this, Mr. Osweiller.</i>

29:47.660 --> 29:49.162
<i>Why should I keep you?</i>

29:52.624 --> 29:54.042
<i>Answer me, boy.</i>

29:57.962 --> 29:58.963
<i>May I?</i>

29:59.714 --> 30:01.424

<i>No!</i>

<i>Why don't you tell them</i>

34:51.714 --> 34:52.590
<i>That's enough!</i>

34:52.673 --> 34:54.884
<i>There were 200 of us at first.</i>

34:55.843 --> 34:58.971
<i>But then, when he realized</i>
<i>what a drain of resources we were,</i>

34:59.055 --> 35:00.306
<i>he culled half of us.</i>

35:00.389 --> 35:02.475
<i>Men, women, children, he took their lives.</i>

35:02.558 --> 35:03.851
<i>How dare you?</i>

35:03.935 --> 35:07.605
<i>On their souls,</i>

<i>You understand</i>
<i>there's a glut in Hospitality,</i>

36:22.638 --> 36:25.892
<i>which means there's only room</i>
<i>for one Head of Department.</i>

36:34.150 --> 36:35.151
<i>The job's yours, Ruth.</i>

<i>Not just a verdict?</i>
