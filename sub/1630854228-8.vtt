WEBVTT

00:02.156 --> 00:03.859
- Happy Tofurky Day, everyone.

00:03.959 --> 00:05.822
- Yeah, who's ready
to celebrate

00:05.922 --> 00:08.908
the shameful legacy
of colonialism?

00:09.008 --> 00:11.312
- Okay, Sarah, coming in hot.

00:11.412 --> 00:13.716
- Yeah, sorry,
I'm just a little...keyed up.

00:13.816 --> 00:15.339
It's not every day that you
have to introduce your parents

00:15.419 --> 00:17.322
to your dad's secret child.

00:17.422 --> 00:18.845
- Guys, I know
that Thanksgiving

00:18.945 --> 00:21.610
is traditionally
our special day of fighting,

00:21.710 --> 00:23.253
but it doesn't have to be.

00:23.353 --> 00:25.176
Let's welcome Harmony
into our family

00:25.276 --> 00:27.279
with dignity and zero drama.

00:27.720 --> 00:28.862
- Mm...

00:28.962 --> 00:30.225
- Can't wait.
- If you say so.

00:30.325 --> 00:31.868
- Come on, you guys,
we can do this.

00:31.968 --> 00:33.430
Harmony gets here an hour
before Mum and Dad.

00:33.530 --> 00:34.953
That gives us plenty of time
to prep her

00:35.053 --> 00:37.157
for Mum's reaction--
sorry, overreaction.

00:37.257 --> 00:39.160
- Should we have done this
in a public place,

00:39.260 --> 00:40.963
you know, so that Mum
can't have a freak-out?

00:41.063 --> 00:42.967
- Do you think an audience
of strangers is gonna stop her?

00:43.067 --> 00:44.329
- Do you not recall

00:44.429 --> 00:46.052
the container-store meltdown
of 2015?

00:46.152 --> 00:47.936
- Yeah.
No, I'm grasping at straws.

00:48.036 --> 00:49.819
- Guys, let's keep it positive
around the kids.

00:49.919 --> 00:53.305
Hey, guys, you excited to me
your new half-aunt, Harmony?

00:53.405 --> 00:54.707
- Is she called a love child

00:54.807 --> 00:56.310
because Grandpa
loves making babies?

00:56.410 --> 00:58.835
- How many love babies
does Grandma have?

00:58.935 --> 01:00.477
- If Grandpa dies,
does Harmony get any money?

01:00.577 --> 01:02.321
- Where does Harmony stand
politically,

01:02.421 --> 01:04.424
and how soon
can we get into that?

01:05.586 --> 01:07.810
- This is gonna be
a fun Thanksgiving.

01:07.910 --> 01:09.213
[chuckles]

01:09.313 --> 01:11.016
[upbeat music]

01:11.116 --> 01:13.480
- ♪ Hey, hey, hey, hey ♪

01:14.963 --> 01:17.307
- [exhales deeply]
- Man, Harmony's running late.

01:17.407 --> 01:18.870
And it's really cutting
into our prep time.

01:18.970 --> 01:20.552
I need 20 minutes alone

01:20.652 --> 01:22.195
just to describe all of Mum's
different smiles.

01:22.295 --> 01:24.299
- Ear to ear, run in fear.
- Showing teeth...

01:25.180 --> 01:26.483
also run in fear.

01:26.583 --> 01:28.206
- Guys, we knew today
could be rough,

01:28.306 --> 01:30.089
so Denise and I planned
some activities

01:30.189 --> 01:31.852
to help keep things light.

01:31.952 --> 01:34.256
- And to avoid
a emotional free-for-all--

01:34.356 --> 01:35.779
a Normals Agenda, if you will.

01:35.879 --> 01:38.544
- We pulled some classic
board games to play

01:38.644 --> 01:40.828
as a low-stakes icebreaker.

01:40.928 --> 01:42.791
- Ooh, Monopoly?
- Absolutely not Monopoly.

01:42.891 --> 01:44.955
- And the kids are gonna put on
a little talent show

01:45.055 --> 01:46.798
just to provide a positive,

01:46.898 --> 01:48.481
noncontroversial focus
for everyone.

01:48.581 --> 01:50.605
Plus, if things go sideways,

01:50.705 --> 01:53.770
we have
a foolproof distraction.

01:53.870 --> 01:55.934
- Baby bomb!
[scattered chuckles]

01:56.034 --> 01:58.098
- Can't have awkward tension
with these guys around.

01:58.198 --> 01:59.260
- Nah, I bet we can do it.

01:59.360 --> 02:00.863
[door opens]
- Hey-o!

02:00.963 --> 02:02.666
- Hello.
- Hi, bro.

02:02.766 --> 02:05.030
- Hey. Harmony, you're here.
[camera shutter clicking]

02:05.130 --> 02:08.195
- With Mum and Dad.
- At the same time.

02:08.295 --> 02:09.558
- Hi, fam.

02:09.658 --> 02:11.762
- So, uh, how did this, um...

02:11.862 --> 02:13.405
Did you guys just bump into
each other in the driveway?

02:13.505 --> 02:15.087
- Oh, no, no, Tommy.

02:15.187 --> 02:16.730
Your mother and I got
so excited, we got jumpy,

02:16.830 --> 02:18.694
and we texted Harmony
a few days ago,

02:18.794 --> 02:21.098
and we have
just hit it off great.

02:21.198 --> 02:22.821
- Before we knew it,
she was flying into Sacramento

02:22.921 --> 02:24.304
to see us early.

02:24.404 --> 02:25.906
- I just wanted to spend
some quality time

02:26.006 --> 02:27.910
with my bio-dad
and my bonus mum.

02:28.010 --> 02:29.593
- I'm a bonus mum.
[all chuckle]

02:29.693 --> 02:31.757
- Wow. So we don't even have
to introduce you.

02:31.857 --> 02:33.680
- And I'm sorry
I didn't tell you.

02:33.780 --> 02:35.603
We just got so caught up in
the fun, and then we thought,

02:35.703 --> 02:38.488
"Why not just surprise them
right after we"...

02:38.588 --> 02:41.373
all: "Escape from Alcatraz"?

02:41.473 --> 02:44.178
- You guys went to Alcatraz?
It's, like, my favourite prison.

02:44.278 --> 02:46.943
- Oh, my God, it was so cool.
We saw Al Capone's cell.

02:47.043 --> 02:50.349
- Well, more like Al Ca-phone.
[laughter]

02:50.449 --> 02:53.194
It's an inside joke.
[laughter continues]

02:53.294 --> 02:54.997
- You guys already have
inside jokes.

02:55.097 --> 02:56.840
That's... that's great.
[camera shutter clicks]

02:56.940 --> 02:58.724
- Oh, and I couldn't show up
without some presents

02:58.824 --> 03:00.727
for my new nieces and nephews.

03:00.827 --> 03:02.690
- That is so thoughtful.

03:02.790 --> 03:04.774
- She's so special, this one.

03:04.874 --> 03:06.938
- Dad, you're really snapping
away there, aren't you?

03:07.038 --> 03:08.340
- Hey, you got to capture

03:08.440 --> 03:09.943
these first few
precious moments, Tommy.

03:10.043 --> 03:10.985
They're so fleeting.

03:11.085 --> 03:12.347
- Oh, that's a framer.

03:12.447 --> 03:15.272
[quirky music]

03:15.372 --> 03:18.238
- Well, she seems to be getting
along great with Mum and Dad.

03:18.338 --> 03:20.201
- Yeah, which is weird because
we don't get along great

03:20.301 --> 03:22.966
with Mum and Dad.
- Yeah, what's her deal?

03:23.066 --> 03:24.488
- Ah, I almost forgot.

03:24.588 --> 03:26.933
My small contribution
to Thanksgiving--

03:27.033 --> 03:28.776
it's a vegan Brie

03:28.876 --> 03:31.220
from a local, Black-owned,
gender-progressive fromagerie.

03:31.320 --> 03:32.943
- Really?
I love all those words.

03:33.043 --> 03:34.987
- Well, it's delicious
and healthy.

03:35.087 --> 03:37.771
[chuckles] Speaking of,
did I spy a gym back there?

03:38.172 --> 03:40.516
- Yeah. You lift or...?

03:40.616 --> 03:42.400
- I'm more into high-intensity
interval training

03:42.500 --> 03:44.283
mixed with rock climbing.
- Stop.

03:44.383 --> 03:46.086
I was thinking about putting
a rock-climbing wall in there.

03:46.186 --> 03:47.328
- No.
- Yeah.

03:47.428 --> 03:48.490
- No.
- Yeah.

03:48.590 --> 03:50.173
- You've got to.
- I will.

03:50.273 --> 03:52.097
- Yeah, but nothing beats
bouldering in Boulder,

03:52.197 --> 03:54.300
'cause Colorado--it's not just
about fitness.

03:54.400 --> 03:56.544
Like, it's also about communing
with nature.

03:56.644 --> 03:59.069
We need the tonic of wildness.

03:59.169 --> 04:01.072
- Are you quoting Thoreau?
- Guilty.

04:01.172 --> 04:02.715
I reread "Walden" every year.

04:02.815 --> 04:04.678
You know, working
for the National Parks,

04:04.778 --> 04:06.682
I'm mostly
in the company of books,

04:06.782 --> 04:08.806
which I guess makes me
a bit of a nerd.

04:08.906 --> 04:11.530
- Well, I Thoreau-ily disagree.

04:11.630 --> 04:13.334
- [laughs]

04:13.434 --> 04:15.257
Okay, well, I'm gonna put this
in the fridge

04:15.357 --> 04:17.501
before it starts leaking.

04:17.601 --> 04:19.424
- [exhales sharply]

04:19.524 --> 04:21.267
- Um, I think
I figured out her deal.

04:21.367 --> 04:22.790
She's freakin' awesome.

04:22.890 --> 04:24.353
- [whispering]
Why do I love her so much?

04:24.453 --> 04:26.917
- Maybe because
she's exactly like all of us.

04:27.017 --> 04:28.239
- [normal voice]
That's it. That's why.

04:28.339 --> 04:29.482
- Yeah.

04:29.582 --> 04:31.585
And we're the best.

04:32.106 --> 04:33.489
- So here's a video

04:33.589 --> 04:35.532
of Harmony
when we stopped for gas.

04:35.632 --> 04:38.217
- She was so tuckered out, she
fell asleep in the back seat.

04:38.317 --> 04:40.902
[laughter]
- Aw.

04:41.002 --> 04:42.584
- Wow.
She's really fitting in.

04:42.684 --> 04:45.029
- Yeah, it's great.
- So great.

04:45.129 --> 04:47.353
- Although I was hoping
we'd have another outsider

04:47.453 --> 04:49.717
to join our team.
- Hi, half-in-laws.

04:49.817 --> 04:51.400
- Oh. Hey.
- Hey.

04:51.500 --> 04:53.884
So how's your first Hayworth
Thanksgiving going?

04:53.984 --> 04:55.767
- Good, I think.
I mean, I don't know.

04:55.867 --> 04:57.611
I don't really have much
to compare it to.

04:57.711 --> 04:59.815
- Oh, everyone here loves you.
You're a hit.

04:59.915 --> 05:01.698
I mean, we're embarrassed

05:01.798 --> 05:03.200
that we thought you were Tom's
stalker the first night we met.

05:03.280 --> 05:04.903
- No worries.

05:05.003 --> 05:06.787
I was so amped up, I would've
thought I was a stalker.

05:06.887 --> 05:09.712
But then again, I listen to way
too many crime podcasts.

05:09.812 --> 05:12.236
- Shut up!
You like true crime?

05:12.336 --> 05:14.119
What's your fave--
murders, kidnappings?

05:14.219 --> 05:16.083
- Stealing someone's identity
to bilk an elderly woman

05:16.183 --> 05:18.367
out of her Nazi gold?
- Oh, those are so much fun.

05:18.467 --> 05:19.930
- Oh, I'm into all of it.

05:20.030 --> 05:22.334
I am obsessed with noir--

05:22.434 --> 05:25.299
both the crime kind and Pinot.

05:25.399 --> 05:27.463
Who wants a top-off?

05:27.563 --> 05:29.466
- I love her.
- I think we love her.

05:29.566 --> 05:31.570
- Let's lock her in.

05:32.972 --> 05:35.076
- So, Harmony,
we're playing teams.

05:35.176 --> 05:37.480
And FYI, I was a runner-up
on Teen "Jeopardy!"

05:37.580 --> 05:38.802
So I guess if you want to win,

05:38.902 --> 05:40.365
then you should maybe play
with me.

05:40.465 --> 05:42.048
[chuckles]
- Yeah, and if you don't mind

05:42.148 --> 05:44.152
hearing this every time you get
a wrong answer...

05:44.632 --> 05:46.095
both: "Oh, boy."

05:46.195 --> 05:47.538
- They're just jealous
because I'm undefeated.

05:47.638 --> 05:49.020
Come. Join me.

05:49.120 --> 05:50.783
- Or--or if you just want
to have fun,

05:50.883 --> 05:53.468
pull up a chair and join
your new partners in crime.

05:53.568 --> 05:55.431
- Sometimes we forget
we're even playing the game.

05:55.531 --> 05:58.517
- No, I'm so sorry, gang, but
Harmony's already on a team.

05:58.617 --> 06:00.400
- Yeah, but it's so nice
to be wanted.

06:00.500 --> 06:02.965
- You three chuckleheads,
why don't you be your own team?

06:03.065 --> 06:05.048
- Fine, but don't say
we didn't warn you.

06:05.148 --> 06:06.370
[exhales sharply]

06:06.470 --> 06:08.494
Come on, big money,
no whammies.

06:08.594 --> 06:10.578
- Wait, wait,
hold your horses there, Conny.

06:10.678 --> 06:11.820
Not your turn yet.

06:11.920 --> 06:13.783
- But I always go first.

06:13.883 --> 06:16.228
- The youngest goes first.
Harmony.

06:16.328 --> 06:17.871
- Oh, no, it's okay.

06:17.971 --> 06:19.233
- She's older than me.

06:19.333 --> 06:21.036
Conny, you know
what your mother meant.

06:21.136 --> 06:22.198
The newest goes first.

06:22.298 --> 06:24.722
- [scoffs]

06:24.822 --> 06:27.367
Okay, fine, but I already blew
on them, so...

06:27.467 --> 06:29.050
- Oh, thank you.

06:29.150 --> 06:31.294
- Looks like there's a new baby
in the family, huh?

06:31.394 --> 06:32.817
- First question--

06:32.917 --> 06:36.343
what ocean surrounds
the Madeira Islands?

06:36.443 --> 06:37.945
- Mm...

06:38.045 --> 06:39.949
Well, they're a part
of Paraguay.

06:40.049 --> 06:41.832
I'm gonna say...
the Atlantic?

06:41.932 --> 06:43.836
- That's right.
- Yes! Wow!

06:43.936 --> 06:45.879
[laughter]

06:45.979 --> 06:47.482
- Kind of a softball.

06:47.582 --> 06:48.885
I mean, there are only
so many oceans, but--

06:48.985 --> 06:50.087
Hey, good job.

06:50.187 --> 06:51.689
- Next question--

06:51.789 --> 06:52.932
- The quadratic equation?

06:53.032 --> 06:54.374
Gadsden Purchase.

06:54.474 --> 06:56.017
"Breakin' 2:
Electric Boogaloo"?

06:56.117 --> 06:57.780
The Manhattan Project?
The Komodo dragon.

06:57.880 --> 06:59.423
"Jack and the Beanstalk."
Tectonic plates.

06:59.523 --> 07:00.825
A motorcycle.
"Fiddler on the Roof."

07:00.925 --> 07:02.228
Whitney Houston.
"White Men Can't Jump"!

07:02.328 --> 07:04.031
- Somebody call Mensa.

07:04.131 --> 07:06.355
You know, you could be
on regular "Jeopardy!"

07:06.455 --> 07:08.158
- Dad.
- Dad.

07:08.258 --> 07:10.683
- Okay, so, um...

07:10.783 --> 07:12.526
Harmony again.

07:12.626 --> 07:14.770
In which
American Indian tribe--

07:14.870 --> 07:17.054
Ugh, this--these cards
are out of date.

07:17.154 --> 07:18.737
It should be
Native American tribe.

07:18.837 --> 07:21.181
- Actually, I believe
the preferred term

07:21.281 --> 07:22.703
is "Indigenous peoples."

07:22.803 --> 07:24.467
[chuckles]

07:24.567 --> 07:27.271
Harmony taught me that
on our drive from Sacramento.

07:27.371 --> 07:29.836
- And you listened?
- Oh, boy.

07:29.936 --> 07:31.920
- Muriel is so eager to learn.

07:32.020 --> 07:34.444
- And did you know that
the celebration of Thanksgiving

07:34.544 --> 07:36.447
is actually very problematic.

07:36.547 --> 07:38.090
You should do
some research, Sarah.

07:38.190 --> 07:39.733
- Gah--I should do
