00:08.717 --> 00:11.803
I love that England has a night
especially for bonfires.

00:12.304 --> 00:14.139
And you always celebrate at Guy's?

00:14.139 --> 00:16.558
Every year. It's always a huge party.

00:17.267 --> 00:18.477
Where is everyone?

00:18.477 --> 00:21.605
It's very odd no one's here to see us in.
And no other guests yet.

00:21.605 --> 00:23.482
It's usually a rather raucous affair.

00:24.983 --> 00:29.071
There he is!
Guy! Good to see you. We missed you.

00:30.614 --> 00:33.700
Here he is, fresh back from New York.

00:33.700 --> 00:36.036
Welcome. Both of you.

00:38.038 --> 00:39.081
Everyone else is inside, so...

00:39.081 --> 00:43.669
We can't seem to locate any of your staff.
Where should my valets--

00:43.669 --> 00:46.129
Oh, yes, upstairs. I'll show them.

00:50.050 --> 00:51.051
Nan?

00:55.681 --> 00:57.808
We're all trying not to ask about the--

00:57.808 --> 00:58.892
Where are the servants?

00:59.893 --> 01:03.313
It's just me here for now, you know,
while the work's being done on the house.

01:05.440 --> 01:06.567
You're here!

01:06.567 --> 01:09.444
- We've been to see the maze.
- Mabel couldn't even find the maze.

01:09.444 --> 01:12.239
I'm looking forward to her
trying to find her way out of it.

01:12.239 --> 01:16.034
Right, so,
Bonfire Night was Mother's favorite.

01:16.743 --> 01:20.414
Months of planning,
a massive feast, hundreds of guests.

01:20.414 --> 01:23.250
And this is everyone?

01:23.250 --> 01:25.043
Yeah, I've kept it intimate.

01:25.043 --> 01:27.129
But I couldn't let the day go by.

01:27.129 --> 01:30.632
So, we'll all have to muck in, but that
was what it was all about, wasn't it?

01:30.632 --> 01:32.426
Mother always had us
chopping wood for fires.

01:32.426 --> 01:34.386
I can help. I can chop wood.

01:37.681 --> 01:39.641
Obviously the ladies aren't
expected to chop wood.

01:41.518 --> 01:42.644
Why is that obvious?

01:43.145 --> 01:45.647
I just meant they're usually
in the kitchen, making treacle toffee.

01:45.647 --> 01:48.734
Which is much more appealing than being
out in the cold, I've always imagined--

01:48.734 --> 01:50.861
Fine. We'll swap.

01:54.907 --> 01:57.326
Are you-- Is everything okay?

02:01.163 --> 02:02.497
Is it something I said?

02:05.375 --> 02:07.169
You must be finding today really hard.

02:08.211 --> 02:11.256
I'm sure the memories of your mother,
they must be...

02:14.676 --> 02:15.677
Stop!

02:18.472 --> 02:21.225
You have to--

02:24.228 --> 02:25.229
I'll just--

02:34.446 --> 02:36.907
You have to put your left hand
on the bottom.

02:38.033 --> 02:39.368
There you go. And then...

02:44.081 --> 02:45.082
Lower.

02:45.082 --> 02:46.834
And then when you swing it around,
you bring it down.

02:46.834 --> 02:47.918
Okay.

02:48.460 --> 02:52.881
Around. And then you bring it down.

02:52.881 --> 02:54.174
Okay.

02:54.174 --> 02:55.509
- Okay?
- Yes.

02:56.134 --> 02:58.345
And then swing more gently.

03:16.530 --> 03:18.448
- Very good.
- Yeah.

03:24.121 --> 03:25.706
It's why I went ahead with it.

03:29.543 --> 03:30.627
This weekend.

03:33.005 --> 03:34.173
I love remembering her.

03:35.340 --> 03:39.845
And the pain of remembering, I cherish it.

03:39.845 --> 03:44.349
Because what I dread
is the pain of forgetting.

03:48.896 --> 03:49.897
What was she like?

03:51.315 --> 03:55.319
She was made of fire.
That's how it seemed.

03:57.029 --> 04:02.701
Everything about her was energy.
And warmth. And unexpected.

04:03.452 --> 04:07.331
Yet, she refused to be less than.

04:07.331 --> 04:12.544
My father never expected her to be.
They were equals. They were best friends.

04:13.086 --> 04:16.255
And I think that's
what I've always wanted too.

04:16.255 --> 04:19.885
I've-- I've--

04:25.974 --> 04:26.975
Sorry.

04:27.601 --> 04:29.144
Don't apologize.

04:29.144 --> 04:32.898
I ought to be getting back to the-- Sorry.

05:49.141 --> 05:50.142
Is this done?

05:51.268 --> 05:53.645
Well, don't you remember
my mother's trick for finding out?

05:56.732 --> 05:59.067
No! Jinny, stop!

05:59.067 --> 06:01.570
- Oh, my God!
- We need to see if it's ready, Lizzy.

06:01.570 --> 06:03.655
So this is where the fun's happening?

06:04.948 --> 06:05.949
Hey.

06:09.203 --> 06:13.457
I'm no cook, of course, but that
does not look like treacle toffee.

06:14.124 --> 06:15.292
Well, it's marshmallow.

06:16.084 --> 06:19.922
Mother used to make it for roasting
on the fire. You'll adore it, I promise.

06:32.935 --> 06:34.144
Delicious.

06:34.144 --> 06:36.104
I just need to let it sit and rest.

06:52.496 --> 06:53.497
Sorry. Fly.

06:57.459 --> 06:59.044
They should be gone by the end of summer,

06:59.044 --> 07:01.463
but there's always
one or two still hanging around.

07:03.841 --> 07:04.842
Bothersome.

07:23.318 --> 07:24.945
Sorry, is this...

07:26.071 --> 07:27.072
Lady Hopeleigh.

07:27.823 --> 07:30.826
The front door was open
and there was no one to...

07:30.826 --> 07:33.412
Jean? What are you doing here?

07:34.329 --> 07:39.001
The invitation implied it was a big party,
but it seems you're renovating?

07:40.961 --> 07:42.713
Am I very late? Or perhaps early?

07:44.756 --> 07:45.841
The guest of honor!

07:46.592 --> 07:47.926
How nice to see you, Lady Hopeleigh.

07:47.926 --> 07:51.180
Guy was just telling me how much
he was looking forward to your arrival.

07:51.847 --> 07:55.267
Now, Jean, has he not offered
to help with your luggage?

07:55.267 --> 07:57.895
He's a brute, of course, but he improves
when you get to know him.

07:59.521 --> 08:01.481
My apologies, I lost track of time.

08:02.191 --> 08:03.734
Theo, would you mind helping me?

08:04.651 --> 08:05.652
Thank you.

08:18.207 --> 08:20.334
Well, that was embarrassing
for everyone concerned.

08:20.334 --> 08:22.920
I wouldn't have asked her
if I'd known it was an intimate gathering.

08:22.920 --> 08:24.171
Why are you inviting people on my behalf?

08:24.171 --> 08:26.173
I thought you might want to
get to know her better.

08:26.173 --> 08:27.508
You never wanted to.

08:27.508 --> 08:29.468
Well, I'm a well-known idiot, of course.

08:29.468 --> 08:31.595
Also, Jean's quite lovely,
don't you think?

08:31.595 --> 08:35.515
Beautiful,
and from a very respectable family.

08:36.475 --> 08:38.268
Why wouldn't you want to get to know her?

08:38.894 --> 08:40.979
It's not as though
you're getting to know anyone else.

09:00.832 --> 09:02.668
So, this will be your room.

09:05.337 --> 09:06.964
I hope you find it comfortable.

09:07.965 --> 09:08.966
Thank you.

09:09.633 --> 09:11.927
So, I'll see you downstairs?

09:12.761 --> 09:15.764
Perhaps you might give me a tour
before we rejoin the others?

09:15.764 --> 09:17.140
I'd love to see the grounds.

09:17.140 --> 09:20.018
I'm afraid I've-- Still have preparations
to make for the bonfire--

09:20.018 --> 09:22.020
- Of course!
- With it just being me--

09:22.020 --> 09:23.605
- There's a lot to do, and--
- Quite.

09:25.524 --> 09:27.734
- Well, I shall...
- Yes, please.

09:33.824 --> 09:37.452
So, just to be clear,
this Guy invented bonfires?

09:37.452 --> 09:40.289
No, he tried to blow up parliament
with a bonfire.

09:40.956 --> 09:42.833
- Is that right?
- No.

09:42.833 --> 09:45.169
There was no bonfire then,
it's just how we celebrate now.

09:45.169 --> 09:47.212
Why would we celebrate blowing up
parliament?

09:47.212 --> 09:49.256
He didn't actually manage to blow it up.

09:49.840 --> 09:53.677
Most English thing ever.
He was bad at it. So, let's celebrate.

09:53.677 --> 09:56.722
I hope Jean's all right.
She seemed a little uncomfortable.

09:57.514 --> 09:59.141
I'm sure Guy's made her feel at ease.

09:59.141 --> 10:01.476
He seems to be giving her
a thorough tour of that bedroom.

10:05.397 --> 10:07.566
Why'd you let Jean think the invitation
came from Guy?

10:07.566 --> 10:10.319
Well, I doubt she'd have come
had she known it was from me.

10:10.319 --> 10:11.904
And just because I didn't want her,

10:11.904 --> 10:13.739
doesn't mean Jean
isn't a good choice for Guy.

10:13.739 --> 10:16.867
She's not a hat that you can toss around
just because it doesn't suit you.

10:16.867 --> 10:20.329
- No, I know. I just--
- It's humiliating to show up uninvited.

10:21.038 --> 10:24.041
Well, no more humiliating
than facing another season unmarried.

10:24.750 --> 10:26.418
Why are you getting so upset about this?

10:26.418 --> 10:28.462
Look, Guy's my dearest friend.

10:29.838 --> 10:31.757
Don't we both want him to be
as happy as we are?

10:31.757 --> 10:34.635
Yes, of course.
And I want Jean to be happy even more.

10:34.635 --> 10:36.178
Then what exactly is the problem?

10:43.101 --> 10:44.102
Hi.

10:47.189 --> 10:49.441
- Hello.
- Sorry.

10:51.318 --> 10:53.612
- I suppose Minnie'll be--
- Miss Testvalley says Minnie's...

10:58.325 --> 11:00.953
I told the others you were on holiday
in the countryside.

11:01.662 --> 11:04.498
Because I thought it better not
to tell the truth

11:05.374 --> 11:07.835
about you and Minnie moving out.

11:07.835 --> 11:10.921
Yes, of course. Probably for the best.

11:12.881 --> 11:14.591
But I can still come and visit next week?

11:14.591 --> 11:17.469
- Yes, come anytime. Come to the house--
- Anytime that's convenient for you.

11:17.469 --> 11:19.930
You can come in the morning
when she's having breakfast.

11:19.930 --> 11:21.640
There'll be dribble everywhere, of course.

11:21.640 --> 11:23.433
Well, you'd better stop
your dribbling then.

11:45.455 --> 11:49.293
I was looking for an escape. But I see
you've already secured the best spot.

11:49.918 --> 11:51.211
There's room for another.

12:09.188 --> 12:10.272
Isn't it utterly divine?

12:17.070 --> 12:20.782
Feeling full is just the greatest
of all feelings, don't you think?

12:23.327 --> 12:24.578
It is a good feeling.

12:27.539 --> 12:32.628
But what about love?

12:35.589 --> 12:39.009
You only think love is better
because you've been full your whole life.

12:39.635 --> 12:41.178
It's different for us.

12:41.178 --> 12:42.262
Americans?

12:43.096 --> 12:44.097
Women.

12:44.598 --> 12:48.227
We are taught to be hungry.

12:48.727 --> 12:52.689
To ignore that ache,
so that you may be as small as possible,

12:52.689 --> 12:55.984
small enough for a man to notice you.

12:56.818 --> 12:58.320
But it makes no sense.

13:00.364 --> 13:01.782
Disappearing to be seen?

13:03.992 --> 13:04.993
Not a bit.

13:07.746 --> 13:11.458
I can't tell you the relief, since
I've stopped trying to attract a husband.

13:12.876 --> 13:15.587
The relief, and also the sweets.

13:18.131 --> 13:22.427
Well, whatever's made you stop,
I'm glad it's making you happy.

13:34.147 --> 13:35.274
I'm not sure I am.

13:39.361 --> 13:42.406
There was a man...

13:47.786 --> 13:51.790
that I trusted and I shouldn't have.

13:52.749 --> 13:53.750
He--

14:00.007 --> 14:03.510
He made me feel ashamed. And afraid.

14:06.722 --> 14:08.307
And I don't know how to change that.

14:10.684 --> 14:13.228
- Someone here in England?
- No. No.

14:16.481 --> 14:17.649
Back in New York.

14:21.904 --> 14:22.905
If I may...

14:27.993 --> 14:29.620
I think you may already have the answer.

14:35.459 --> 14:41.715
You didn't say you did something shameful,
you said he made you feel ashamed.

14:49.431 --> 14:50.432
He did.

14:59.066 --> 15:02.236
And I've been carrying that shame
with me ever since.

15:18.836 --> 15:19.837
But...

15:24.842 --> 15:30.889
I guess, perhaps that shame,
it belongs to him.

15:34.601 --> 15:36.103
And it's not mine to keep.

15:39.147 --> 15:40.315
It's my choice to--

15:44.111 --> 15:45.612
Just to let it go.

16:01.211 --> 16:03.714
Sorry, Jean, I was just--

16:05.090 --> 16:07.092
I heard you'd arrived.
I thought you'd be with Guy.

16:09.553 --> 16:11.889
He had no idea I was even coming.

16:13.682 --> 16:15.184
I thought Guy's invitation odd.

16:15.851 --> 16:20.814
I was in no hurry to accept,
but my mother got wind and--

16:21.940 --> 16:24.526
- I'm sure you know how that goes.
- Yes.

16:28.363 --> 16:29.907
Comes to something when even the men

16:29.907 --> 16:31.867
you aren't interested in
can't get away fast enough.

16:32.910 --> 16:34.453
Then Guy's a fool.

16:34.453 --> 16:37.122
You were the beauty of the season.
Everyone said so.

16:37.122 --> 16:40.709
Haven't you heard?
That's not nearly enough anymore.

16:41.835 --> 16:44.087
I watched my older sisters
play the marriage game.

16:44.087 --> 16:47.966
And I didn't just learn the rules,
I perfected them.

16:50.552 --> 16:56.558
Then they arrived, the Americans.
And the rules changed.

16:57.684 --> 17:01.480
Now, men like girls who challenge them.

17:01.480 --> 17:05.233
And they want their wives to be confident.

17:06.944 --> 17:09.988
My whole life,
I've been told to make less noise.

17:12.241 --> 17:14.535
And now everyone's wondering
why they can't hear me.

17:18.372 --> 17:20.415
I couldn't bear it when they came
at first,

17:20.999 --> 17:25.921
saying every thought out loud
and giving in to every whim.

17:29.341 --> 17:31.552
But when was the last time
you laughed like they do?

17:33.762 --> 17:35.764
Not since I was a child.

17:36.557 --> 17:40.811
I used to think that they needed
to be taught how to behave.

17:43.146 --> 17:44.147
And now?

17:48.151 --> 17:50.779
I wonder if it's us
who need to learn how to live.

18:09.173 --> 18:11.008
Right then, the rules are simple.

18:11.008 --> 18:12.676
First to the center finds the torch.

18:12.676 --> 18:15.304
Whoever finds the torch
lights the bonfire.

18:16.138 --> 18:19.224
Girls, you're all gonna have a head start,
as it's your first time.

18:19.224 --> 18:20.475
Any questions?

18:20.475 --> 18:23.937
Yes. Mabel would like to know
where the maze is.

18:27.024 --> 18:28.150
And...

18:30.194 --> 18:31.195
go!

18:31.195 --> 18:32.487
This way, come on.

18:35.324 --> 18:36.325
This way.

18:40.412 --> 18:44.082
Jinny, I know a way out.
The house is empty.

18:44.791 --> 18:47.920
Take this, wave it above the hedge
and I'll come find you.

18:47.920 --> 18:49.922
Then we can sneak off together, yes?

19:01.099 --> 19:02.100
Mabel?

19:04.686 --> 19:05.687
I've thought about you...

19:07.856 --> 19:09.608
since that night at Tintagel.

19:11.318 --> 19:14.988
Lady Honoria, are you flirting?

19:25.916 --> 19:29.503
You are. I'm delighted for you.

19:35.926 --> 19:37.678
Do you feel a sneeze coming on?

19:39.555 --> 19:40.556
No.

19:41.056 --> 19:44.643
James wants me to wave it above a hedge
so he can find me,

19:44.643 --> 19:45.978
and we can sneak off together.

19:47.396 --> 19:48.981
How romantic.

19:48.981 --> 19:52.442
Though honestly,
selfishly, I would be a little sad.

19:52.442 --> 19:55.112
We so rarely get to see each other
these days.

19:55.112 --> 19:58.323
- I know, almost never, in fact.
- And time is just going by so quickly.

19:58.323 --> 19:59.741
Before you know it,
I'll be back in New York.

19:59.741 --> 20:02.828
And James and I have all the time
in the world to spend together at home.

20:03.745 --> 20:08.542
Suppose there's always a chance
you might just drop the handkerchief.

20:08.542 --> 20:09.835
Accidentally, of course.

20:11.003 --> 20:15.674
No, I wouldn't. I couldn't.

20:16.675 --> 20:18.051
And go!

20:19.386 --> 20:20.762
- Let's do it.
- Stay back!

20:20.762 --> 20:22.014
I mean it.

22:13.375 --> 22:14.626
Hello?

22:18.881 --> 22:19.923
Is there anyone there?

22:24.595 --> 22:25.762
Me.

22:30.934 --> 22:32.186
Nan?

22:36.732 --> 22:37.816
Are you alone?

22:40.527 --> 22:41.528
Yes.

22:42.237 --> 22:43.238
Good.

22:44.865 --> 22:45.949
Is it?

22:51.496 --> 22:52.748
I just--

22:53.707 --> 22:56.376
Well, I was just thinking about
what you said earlier

22:57.711 --> 23:00.297
about your mother and father's marriage
and how--

23:01.465 --> 23:04.051
and how they were equals,

23:04.718 --> 23:06.136
and how you want that for yourself.

23:07.387 --> 23:09.932
- Yes?
- And what you said you wanted

23:09.932 --> 23:14.061
out of a marriage is a best friend.

23:14.895 --> 23:19.858
And friends, they're supposed to be
relaxed around one another, aren't they?

23:20.567 --> 23:22.903
And they're supposed to be excited wh--

23:22.903 --> 23:25.113
About when they see each other,
and when they're with each other.

23:25.113 --> 23:26.865
They're never supposed to be
awkward with one another.

23:26.865 --> 23:29.326
And I just don't think
you and Jean are best friends.

23:29.326 --> 23:31.203
What have you ever laughed about with her?

23:31.203 --> 23:32.829
What have you ever shared with her?

23:32.829 --> 23:35.582
I don't think it makes any sense
for the two of you to get married.

23:37.459 --> 23:39.169
I'm not thinking of marrying Jean.

23:39.837 --> 23:42.256
I'm not marrying anyone.
Why are you so interested in marriage?

23:42.256 --> 23:45.133
- I'm not interested in marriage.
- But you're getting married.

23:47.302 --> 23:49.888
- Yes.
- Despite everything I put in my telegram.

23:50.556 --> 23:51.640
So, I'm not sure

23:51.640 --> 23:53.517
- why you're so bothered about what--
- Wait, what telegram?

23:55.978 --> 23:56.979
The telegram.

23:59.940 --> 24:01.859
- You didn't get a telegram in New York?
- No.

24:03.110 --> 24:06.613
No, I didn't get any sort of telegram.

24:08.782 --> 24:09.950
What did it say?

24:14.037 --> 24:15.038
Stay there.

24:45.444 --> 24:47.613
Oh, goodness!

24:47.613 --> 24:50.657
Nan, these mazes, it's like
they don't want us to find our way out.

24:51.742 --> 24:52.910
What is it? What's wrong?

24:55.579 --> 24:56.580
Nan?

24:58.040 --> 24:59.041
Quickly.

24:59.041 --> 25:02.836
- Do we go right to the end?
- It is. It's right. I told you.

25:24.983 --> 25:26.026
Ah, for goodness' sake!

25:26.902 --> 25:28.862
Has there been a single year
you haven't won?

25:30.614 --> 25:32.574
You're right, of course.
It's not a fair fight.

25:34.576 --> 25:36.662
I know this maze as well as I know Guy.

25:39.373 --> 25:42.042
Of course. Who could have predicted?

25:45.254 --> 25:47.798
What? Every year?

25:48.674 --> 25:50.008
We'll have a drink, shall we?

25:50.676 --> 25:54.471
To celebrate...
before I burn Guy to the ground.

26:13.031 --> 26:15.075
What a good decision we made, my darling,

26:15.075 --> 26:17.119
to put this lake in our stately home.

26:17.119 --> 26:18.954
It was the perfect choice.

26:19.663 --> 26:22.165
You, my dear, have impeccable taste.

26:22.165 --> 26:25.711
Those curtains you chose for our parlor
are a delight.

26:29.256 --> 26:30.716
Home sweet home.

26:31.383 --> 26:33.760
It's a bit smaller than I remember.

26:33.760 --> 26:35.762
But exactly what we need.

26:39.433 --> 26:40.517
It's getting quite late.

26:42.477 --> 26:45.022
Perhaps we should retire.

26:48.901 --> 26:50.110
Are you sure you're ready?

26:51.945 --> 26:52.946
For retiring?

26:56.033 --> 26:57.034
Quite sure.

27:07.252 --> 27:10.547
- And what do you think the telegram said?
- I don't know.

27:10.547 --> 27:14.843
Nan, you do know. You absolutely know.

27:14.843 --> 27:18.138
He wouldn't send a secret telegram
halfway across the world

27:18.138 --> 27:19.431
to tell you what he had for breakfast.

27:19.431 --> 27:22.434
Maybe he would, because we're friends,
and we're good friends.

27:23.560 --> 27:25.395
Although, there was this moment
when we were chopping wood,

27:25.395 --> 27:28.440
and it felt like something.
And it's just all so confusing.

27:28.440 --> 27:29.608
I just don't--

27:30.651 --> 27:32.903
I really tried to stop it
but I saw him with Jean and it's--

27:32.903 --> 27:35.239
- And you were jealous?
- No, of course not!

27:38.200 --> 27:42.829
- Maybe.
- Oh, Nan. Oh, Nan, I knew it. I knew it.

27:44.081 --> 27:46.959
Are you in love with Guy Thwarte?

27:46.959 --> 27:48.460
I can't be. This is all--

27:48.460 --> 27:51.046
He makes me angrier than any other person
in this whole world.

27:51.046 --> 27:54.258
Yes, sometimes we laugh
and it's sometimes that breathless laugh.

27:54.258 --> 27:55.884
But in between those moments of joy,

27:55.884 --> 27:59.179
there are so many more
of aggravation and irritation and--

27:59.179 --> 28:03.267
- Nan, what you're describing is love.
- No, love is calm. Love is stability.

28:03.267 --> 28:05.894
Love is a heart attack.

28:06.603 --> 28:08.772
Love is the best and worst of everything.

28:08.772 --> 28:13.026
Love is hating someone
with every inch of your soul,

28:13.026 --> 28:16.905
yet spending even a minute without them
is the worst pain you've ever known.

28:16.905 --> 28:20.409
Conchie, you have to tell Dick
that you still love him.

28:20.409 --> 28:22.286
Nan, this isn't about me and Dick.

28:22.828 --> 28:26.206
This is about you and Guy and--

28:26.206 --> 28:29.334
And Theo. Theo, we're about to get married

28:29.334 --> 28:31.712
- and that's what makes this so--
- Are you certain?

28:31.712 --> 28:33.839
- Are you quite certain?
- I thought so. I--

28:34.339 --> 28:35.674
How can you ever be certain?

28:35.674 --> 28:39.011
The way he talked about Jean today
was like she was a possession.

28:39.011 --> 28:41.555
- And meanwhile, Guy-- He is just--
- He's so charming.

28:41.555 --> 28:44.183
- Yes. Yes, and he's so easy.
- Considerate.

28:44.183 --> 28:47.269
- He's one of us.
- And how infuriating is that?

28:50.147 --> 28:53.609
What business does Guy have
sending me telegrams about--

28:53.609 --> 28:54.902
About how he loves you?

28:54.902 --> 28:56.195
- Yes! How dare he?
- I know.

28:56.195 --> 28:58.697
Because that's all I can think about.
And I need to know

28:58.697 --> 29:00.240
what is in that stupid telegram.

29:00.240 --> 29:01.742
I think you do. Nan?

29:01.742 --> 29:04.286
Just be careful. And be sure.

29:05.621 --> 29:09.082
It is kind of exciting, though. It is!

29:13.545 --> 29:14.546
Yes!

29:22.346 --> 29:24.264
Lies, Lizzy Elmsworth.

29:24.264 --> 29:27.935
- You are a liar.
- No, I remember it like it was yesterday.

29:27.935 --> 29:30.562
Johnny Baldwin claimed
that he could do more cartwheels

29:30.562 --> 29:34.650
than anybody in the whole of Saratoga,
and you simply had to prove him wrong.

29:34.650 --> 29:36.944
The whole town saw your undergarments.

29:36.944 --> 29:38.820
No, I'd never do such a thing. I'm a lady.

29:40.364 --> 29:42.241
A lady that can do 13 cartwheels in a row,

29:43.575 --> 29:44.576
practically 14.

29:46.411 --> 29:49.873
James will be so furious I ran away, but...

29:53.210 --> 29:54.211
it's been so worth it.

30:56.565 --> 30:59.026
- What did the telegram say?
- Excuse me?

30:59.026 --> 31:02.988
Well, of course, as so often,
you're in every way quite intolerable.

31:03.697 --> 31:05.365
Where do you find the audacity?

31:05.365 --> 31:08.994
- I am engaged to your best friend.
- That is not in any way news to me.

31:08.994 --> 31:12.956
Happily engaged, I should add.
Why should I even speak to you?

31:12.956 --> 31:14.499
After you left me at Runnymede.

31:14.499 --> 31:17.586
I told you my most precious secret
and you couldn't run away fast enough.

31:17.586 --> 31:19.838
But I came back to apologize.

31:19.838 --> 31:21.924
I came back almost immediately,
and you were already engaged.

31:21.924 --> 31:23.008
Well, how convenient.

31:24.468 --> 31:27.137
You caused all this confusion
with the wood chopping,

31:27.137 --> 31:29.389
and with grand speeches
about how you wanna fall in love

31:29.389 --> 31:31.099
with someone who's your equal.
How dare you?

31:31.099 --> 31:33.977
- Nan, listen, I--
- No, it's too late.

31:33.977 --> 31:36.897
Where was all of this-- these feelings
and the confusion when we first met?

31:36.897 --> 31:38.357
When you climbed out of a window above me?

31:38.357 --> 31:40.025
- Yes!
- When we danced down a staircase?

31:40.025 --> 31:41.652
- Yes!
- When we looked at each other.

31:41.652 --> 31:42.569
When we laughed.

31:42.569 --> 31:44.279
When it felt like
we immediately knew each other

31:44.279 --> 31:46.323
and that anything was entirely possible?

31:46.323 --> 31:49.368
That together, we could go anywhere,
or do anything.

31:49.368 --> 31:51.453
It wouldn't matter if we were
in a palace or a tree,

31:51.453 --> 31:54.039
as long as we were laughing
and dancing and kissing

31:54.039 --> 31:56.166
and discovering and kissing again.

31:56.166 --> 31:59.586
When I realized, Nan,
that I am desperately in love with you.

31:59.586 --> 32:02.381
And I have been since the first second
I set eyes on you.

32:22.234 --> 32:25.612
Nan! Nan, wait.

32:33.203 --> 32:35.330
Nan. Nan.

32:36.748 --> 32:39.209
Nan, just-- Nan, please, let's just--

32:43.213 --> 32:44.381
There you both are.

32:46.508 --> 32:49.845
I was just showing Nan the walled garden.

32:52.055 --> 32:53.390
Your mother's favorite place.

32:54.558 --> 32:56.018
Lizzy and Jinny still aren't back yet,

32:56.018 --> 32:58.228
so we were just about to start
a game of poker.

32:59.813 --> 33:03.317
- Are you in?
- I don't know.

33:03.317 --> 33:04.401
No obligation, of course.

33:04.401 --> 33:07.613
I know it's more of a risk
for some than others.

33:07.613 --> 33:08.697
Financially.

33:09.531 --> 33:10.908
Nan, you'll play though?

33:10.908 --> 33:12.618
You're not having to be careful
with money.

33:14.828 --> 33:15.829
I'll play.

33:18.665 --> 33:19.666
Excellent.

33:19.666 --> 33:21.752
Yeah. Yeah, I suppose...

33:22.544 --> 33:23.879
Excellent.

33:50.906 --> 33:53.158
- I can always help you out if...
- No need.

34:05.462 --> 34:07.297
You know, I have a 15-year winning streak.

34:08.047 --> 34:11.051
You've beaten me
every single day of our lives

34:11.552 --> 34:13.469
in a number of ways.

34:15.179 --> 34:16.306
Doesn't mean you always will.

34:46.712 --> 34:49.339
A lot of money. Congratulations. I'm--

34:50.090 --> 34:51.300
I'm glad it worked out for you.

34:52.134 --> 34:54.844
Perhaps now you can hire
some of your old servants back.

34:55.512 --> 34:57.097
I think we all know they're not on leave.

35:02.436 --> 35:04.313
- Theo.
- Or maybe you could even stop looking

35:04.313 --> 35:06.064
for that rich American bride
you've been after.

35:07.858 --> 35:10.819
That was your plan, wasn't it?
When you went to New York?

35:13.030 --> 35:14.990
Save the family fortunes
with a wealthy match.

35:20.120 --> 35:21.121
Isn't that right?

35:25.250 --> 35:28.420
But all you needed was a few lucky hands.

35:34.343 --> 35:36.428
I haven't put my cards down yet.

35:45.479 --> 35:46.480
I win.

35:48.440 --> 35:54.655
Which is strange, because it feels like
I have absolutely nothing...

35:57.407 --> 35:58.408
at all.

36:17.219 --> 36:22.391
To remember Guy Fawkes...
and his failed betrayal.

36:53.422 --> 36:58.302
I am an idiot, of course,
for believing you when you said

36:58.302 --> 36:59.803
you wanted a partner and not a wife.

36:59.803 --> 37:02.264
And for thinking that you saw the world
the same way I do,

37:02.264 --> 37:04.516
when all you were doing was
just telling me what I wanted to hear.

37:04.516 --> 37:07.144
- God, no. Nan--
- But the worst thing

37:07.936 --> 37:10.564
is you could only do that
because I trusted you again.

37:12.733 --> 37:14.693
I told you things I haven't told anyone.

37:16.320 --> 37:17.487
I thought we were friends,

37:18.655 --> 37:21.158
and for a brief moment, I was terrified

37:23.160 --> 37:24.244
that we were something more.

37:27.164 --> 37:30.334
The truth is, we're neither.

38:00.781 --> 38:03.325
- I'm so sorry.
- Why are you sorry?

38:03.325 --> 38:06.745
I left. I let you down, as I so often do,

38:06.745 --> 38:07.829
- and--
- Hey.

38:08.914 --> 38:10.457
You never let me down.

38:11.291 --> 38:14.628
No need to cry, Jinny.
I hate seeing you like this, come on.

38:15.337 --> 38:17.923
Come here. Come here.

38:24.304 --> 38:26.139
Go and say goodbye to your friends.

38:26.640 --> 38:30.978
I'll see you in the room,
and we will talk this all through, yes?

38:30.978 --> 38:32.646
- Okay.
- Okay.

38:33.272 --> 38:34.273
Go on.

39:18.108 --> 39:19.234
I wish you'd told me.

39:23.405 --> 39:24.865
Your mother's portraits.

39:28.785 --> 39:30.120
I wouldn't have let you sell them.

39:34.041 --> 39:35.751
It's not just the portraits, Theo.

39:38.170 --> 39:42.758
It's the whole house.
I've lost everything.

39:44.510 --> 39:47.763
That's what this party was for.

39:49.431 --> 39:50.641
To say goodbye.

39:51.683 --> 39:53.602
I can help.

39:53.602 --> 39:56.021
I can't keep taking from you, Theo.

39:59.608 --> 40:00.609
And I won't.

40:12.913 --> 40:14.248
Jean really is a lovely girl.

40:46.697 --> 40:47.698
James?

40:51.368 --> 40:52.369
James?

40:56.582 --> 41:00.586
I'm so sorry, James. Please let me in.
Please?

41:15.434 --> 41:16.435
Is everything--

41:19.563 --> 41:20.564
You left.

41:22.316 --> 41:23.525
I thought we'd be missed.

41:34.328 --> 41:36.371
You make me brave.

41:38.874 --> 41:40.250
I mean it.

41:40.250 --> 41:42.836
You're the bravest person I've ever met.

41:42.836 --> 41:47.424
I walked out. And I left you.

41:49.676 --> 41:52.679
I'd expected that you wanted to
go back up to the house,

41:53.430 --> 41:56.058
just before our children return home
from school.

41:56.058 --> 41:57.142
Honoria.

41:57.142 --> 41:58.852
You know how little William
loves to play the piano,

41:58.852 --> 42:01.271
- so--
- Honoria, stop it! Please, stop it.

42:01.939 --> 42:02.940
Why?

42:04.066 --> 42:07.569
Because it's ridiculous. It's stupid.

42:08.862 --> 42:10.656
As if we could ever
actually have children.

42:12.824 --> 42:13.825
But it's just a game.

42:15.160 --> 42:16.411
Do you not understand?

42:16.954 --> 42:18.664
Our whole lives are pretending.

42:19.248 --> 42:21.708
Every single one of my friends
gets to dance and giggle

42:21.708 --> 42:24.878
and hold hands in public the whole time,
and nobody minds a bit.

42:25.462 --> 42:28.549
They don't have to be brave.
They get celebrated.

42:28.549 --> 42:30.759
They get a ring and a party,

42:30.759 --> 42:33.303
and they have parents
that can bear to look at them.

42:34.596 --> 42:37.891
Honoria, this isn't new to me.
None of this.

42:38.725 --> 42:42.855
And in fact, it bores me.
Pretending bores me.

43:24.229 --> 43:28.567
Nan, I wanted to... apologize.

43:29.610 --> 43:31.236
Somehow I haven't been myself today.

43:34.740 --> 43:35.782
You haven't?

43:37.951 --> 43:39.411
The way I treated Jean,

43:39.411 --> 43:41.914
and those things I said
after the poker game...

43:43.707 --> 43:45.125
That's not who I want to be.

43:46.502 --> 43:52.633
The truth is, I've always been
a little jealous of Guy.

43:54.510 --> 44:01.141
He's so effortlessly likable
because of who he is, not what he is.

44:03.685 --> 44:06.897
My life is entirely power, but no control.

44:09.233 --> 44:12.819
And this love, the way I feel about you,

44:14.279 --> 44:19.034
its power, its strength is overwhelming.

44:20.202 --> 44:23.455
I'm out of control of it
and utterly terrified of--

44:26.667 --> 44:27.960
Of losing you.
