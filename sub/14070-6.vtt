00:07.342 --> 00:08.760
Nancy!

00:09.761 --> 00:11.304
Nancy!

00:11.387 --> 00:12.764
Come on, come on.

00:12.847 --> 00:14.432
Nancy!

00:16.559 --> 00:17.644
Where are you?

00:17.727 --> 00:20.772
Jonathan! Jonathan!

00:21.356 --> 00:22.941
Jonathan!

00:24.651 --> 00:26.361
Jonathan, I'm right here!

00:27.028 --> 00:28.196
Nancy!

00:30.615 --> 00:31.741
Nancy!

00:32.617 --> 00:34.410
Jonathan, where are you?

00:34.494 --> 00:37.121
Jonathan!

00:37.205 --> 00:38.915
Jonathan!

00:38.998 --> 00:41.125
Jonathan, I'm right...
I'm right here!

00:41.209 --> 00:43.044
- Where are you?

00:43.127 --> 00:44.754
- I'm right here!
- Jonathan!

00:44.837 --> 00:47.215
I'm right here! Nancy!

00:47.298 --> 00:51.511
- Just follow my voice!
- Jonathan!

00:51.594 --> 00:54.847
Follow my voice, Nancy, I'm right here!

00:58.768 --> 01:00.186
Nancy!

01:30.091 --> 01:31.134
Nancy?

01:33.553 --> 01:34.721
Nancy.

01:36.973 --> 01:39.851
Nancy!
Follow my voice!

01:45.523 --> 01:46.774
Nancy?

01:53.615 --> 01:55.283
- Jonathan!
- Nancy!

02:10.465 --> 02:13.509
I got you.

03:36.008 --> 03:37.760
I just don't understand
why we're coming out here.

03:37.844 --> 03:41.097
-She obviously doesn't wanna talk to you.
-That's... that's not it.

03:41.180 --> 03:44.851
Oh, really? Because no girl
would ever blow off King Steve.

03:44.934 --> 03:47.603
She was acting weird.
I mean, something was wrong.

03:47.687 --> 03:49.605
So what?
Like, you're worried about her?

03:49.689 --> 03:53.109
-What?
-Aw, you are.

03:53.192 --> 03:55.903
-Aw, Steve has a heart.
-Would you just-- Stop.

03:55.987 --> 03:57.572
-Oh, Stevey's in love.
-Would you just shut up?

03:57.655 --> 03:58.990
-Who knew?
-Shut up!

03:59.073 --> 04:00.408
Jeez.

04:01.993 --> 04:04.412
- Damn. Sorry.

04:09.375 --> 04:12.211
So this is it, huh?
Princess' castle.

04:13.921 --> 04:15.965
I'll just be a minute.

04:46.913 --> 04:48.331
Look, we gotta
go through this again.

04:48.414 --> 04:51.209
-I told you everything that I saw.
-Oh, gosh. Tell me again.

04:51.292 --> 04:53.628
-Upstairs or downstairs?
-Upstairs.

04:53.711 --> 04:54.837
There was a laboratory.

04:54.921 --> 04:57.507
It was where they must do experiments
or something, and then there was...

04:58.716 --> 05:00.134
There was this kid's room.

05:00.218 --> 05:03.888
-How do you know it was a kid's room?
-More like a prison.

05:03.971 --> 05:06.390
So why would you think
it was a kid's room, then?

05:06.474 --> 05:07.850
Because, I told you,

05:07.934 --> 05:10.645
the size of the bed, there was a drawing,
there was a stuffed animal--

05:10.728 --> 05:12.355
You didn't say
there was a drawing.

05:12.438 --> 05:14.273
Yeah, there was a drawing of a...
an adult and a child.

05:14.357 --> 05:16.692
-It said "Eleven" on it.
-Was it good?

05:16.776 --> 05:19.028
It was a kid's drawing, Joyce.
It was stick figures.

05:24.826 --> 05:26.786
Wasn't Will.

05:35.753 --> 05:36.963
Earl...

05:38.714 --> 05:39.840
The night that Benny died,

05:39.924 --> 05:45.221
Earl said he saw some kid
with a shaved head with Benny.

05:45.304 --> 05:49.058
Now, I pressed him,
he said it might be Will, but maybe...

05:49.141 --> 05:50.935
Wait... Maybe, it wasn't?

05:51.018 --> 05:53.354
Look... this woman, Terry Ives,

05:53.437 --> 05:55.523
she claims to have lost
her daughter, Jane.

05:55.606 --> 05:58.025
She sued Brenner,
she sued the government...

05:58.109 --> 06:00.486
Now, the claims came to nothing,
but what if...

06:02.238 --> 06:04.699
I mean,
what if this whole time I've been...

06:04.782 --> 06:06.450
I've been looking for Will...

06:07.451 --> 06:09.495
I've been chasing after some other kid?

06:28.264 --> 06:29.265
Nancy!

06:47.742 --> 06:49.243
Better?

06:51.078 --> 06:52.204
Yeah.

06:53.914 --> 06:57.084
Is this okay?
Uh, I found it in the closet.

06:59.086 --> 07:00.713
- I can go home.
- I just figured--

07:00.796 --> 07:02.757
- Yeah, no.
- I...

07:04.300 --> 07:07.136
- I don't wanna be alone.

07:08.054 --> 07:11.265
-Do you?
-No. Uh... no.

07:46.217 --> 07:48.219
Can you just come up here?

07:53.683 --> 07:54.809
Yeah.

08:06.404 --> 08:08.656
- Do you want the lights off, or--
- On.

08:09.865 --> 08:11.158
Yeah.

08:14.996 --> 08:16.372
You know, it...

08:17.373 --> 08:19.208
it can't get us in here.

08:24.588 --> 08:26.173
We don't know that.

09:31.072 --> 09:34.700
Uh, yeah, it's Ives.
Terry Ives. That's with a "Y."

09:34.784 --> 09:37.703
Yeah, I got a pen.
Hang on.

09:40.414 --> 09:41.665
Mmm-hmm.

09:42.917 --> 09:44.335
Mmm-hmm.

09:44.418 --> 09:47.588
Great, thanks.
I really appreciate this, Frank.

09:47.671 --> 09:49.673
Say hi to the boys for me, too, would you?

09:57.056 --> 09:58.724
Did you get it?

09:58.808 --> 10:00.726
-I got it.
-Okay.

10:21.580 --> 10:22.706
Oh...

10:23.707 --> 10:24.792
Hey.

10:26.168 --> 10:27.294
Hey.

10:28.170 --> 10:30.506
Couldn't sleep?

10:34.343 --> 10:36.929
Every time I close my eyes, I just...

10:38.848 --> 10:41.559
keep seeing that... thing.

10:42.393 --> 10:46.063
Wherever I was, that place...

10:47.148 --> 10:49.733
I think that it lives there.

10:49.817 --> 10:51.652
It was feeding there.

10:52.987 --> 10:54.780
Feeding on that deer.

10:55.865 --> 10:58.242
That means that if...

10:58.325 --> 11:00.744
if Will and Barbara...

11:04.665 --> 11:05.833
Hey.

11:06.458 --> 11:08.586
My mom said she talked to Will.

11:09.336 --> 11:12.006
If he's alive,
there's a chance Barbara is, too.

11:12.089 --> 11:14.091
That means that she's trapped...

11:14.717 --> 11:16.510
in that place.

11:20.472 --> 11:22.266
We have to find it again.

11:22.349 --> 11:24.310
You wanna go back out there?

11:24.852 --> 11:26.186
Maybe we don't have to.

11:26.854 --> 11:29.565
When I saw it,
it was feeding on that deer.

11:29.648 --> 11:32.776
-Meaning it's... it's a predator, right?
-Right.

11:32.860 --> 11:36.947
And it seems to hunt at night, like a...
a lion or a coyote.

11:37.031 --> 11:38.741
But it doesn't hunt in packs like them.

11:39.658 --> 11:41.994
It's always alone, like...

11:43.078 --> 11:44.121
like a bear.

11:44.204 --> 11:47.541
And remember at Steve's,
when Barb cut herself?

11:47.625 --> 11:51.211
-And then, last night, the deer...
-Hmm, it was bleeding, too.

11:51.295 --> 11:52.504
One sec.

11:53.464 --> 11:55.966
Sharks can detect blood
in one part per million.

11:56.050 --> 11:58.010
That's one drop of blood in a million,

11:58.093 --> 12:00.346
and they can smell it
from a quarter mile away.

12:00.429 --> 12:03.098
So you're saying it can detect blood?

12:04.600 --> 12:06.185
It's just a theory.

12:07.686 --> 12:09.188
We could test it.

12:11.523 --> 12:13.400
But if it works...

12:14.318 --> 12:16.278
At least we'll know it's coming.

12:19.573 --> 12:22.076
--Honey, are you up?

12:22.159 --> 12:24.662
Yeah, I'm... I'm getting dressed.

12:24.745 --> 12:27.289
I, uh, made
some blueberry pancakes.

12:27.373 --> 12:29.041
I'll be down in a second.

12:40.135 --> 12:42.596
--Your mom doesn't knock?

12:56.026 --> 12:58.112
-Hi. Scott Clarke?
-Uh, yes.

12:58.195 --> 13:00.239
The same Scott Clarke
who teaches science and AV

13:00.322 --> 13:01.490
-at Hawkins Middle?
-The very same.

13:01.573 --> 13:02.825
Oh, wonderful.

13:02.908 --> 13:06.412
...and we're making a newsletter,
which we'll send out monthly.

13:06.495 --> 13:08.414
It'll showcase all the latest equipment,

13:08.497 --> 13:11.417
as well as how-to articles,
which the kids write themselves.

13:11.500 --> 13:12.918
Oh, that's neat.

13:13.002 --> 13:14.586
What we're really trying to do here,
Mr. Clarke--

13:14.670 --> 13:16.296
Uh, please, call me Scott.

13:16.380 --> 13:17.923
Scott.

13:18.007 --> 13:21.927
What we're trying to do here, Scott,
is to connect kids from all over the state

13:22.011 --> 13:24.013
and give them
the support and encouragement

13:24.096 --> 13:26.098
to pursue careers in technology.

13:26.181 --> 13:28.892
We feel these are the kinds of kids
that are going to make Indiana proud.

13:28.976 --> 13:31.520
I agree, yes.
Completely.

13:31.603 --> 13:34.606
So, you know any kids
you think might wanna participate?

13:34.690 --> 13:37.401
Oh, I have a few in mind.

13:48.078 --> 13:50.873
I just...
I can't believe she didn't come back.

13:50.956 --> 13:52.958
- She's gotta be close.
- She said it wasn't safe.

13:53.042 --> 13:55.586
She just messed up the compasses
because she wanted to protect us.

13:55.669 --> 13:57.838
-She didn't betray us.
-Mike, calm down.

13:57.921 --> 14:00.174
I shouldn't have yelled at her.
I never should've done that.

14:00.257 --> 14:02.843
-Mike, this isn't your fault.
-Yeah, it's Lucas'.

14:02.926 --> 14:04.011
It wasn't his fault, either.

14:05.429 --> 14:07.222
-It wasn't his fault?
-No.

14:07.306 --> 14:09.016
So you're saying
he wasn't way out of line?

14:09.099 --> 14:10.642
-Totally, but so were you!
-What?

14:10.726 --> 14:12.394
-And so was Eleven.
-Oh, give me a break!

14:12.478 --> 14:13.645
No, Mike, you give me a break!

14:13.729 --> 14:16.190
All three of you were being
a bunch of little assholes!

14:16.273 --> 14:17.816
I was the only reasonable one.

14:17.900 --> 14:20.569
But the bottom line is...
you pushed first.

14:20.652 --> 14:22.529
And you know the rule.
You draw first blood...

14:22.613 --> 14:24.365
No! No way!
I'm not shaking his hand.

14:24.448 --> 14:25.991
-You're shaking his hand!
-No, I'm not.

14:26.075 --> 14:29.119
This isn't a discussion.
This is the rule of law.

14:29.203 --> 14:32.998
Obey or be banished from the party.
Do you wanna be banished?

14:33.624 --> 14:34.958
-No.
-Good.

14:37.378 --> 14:38.587
Where are we going?

14:38.670 --> 14:40.964
Where do you think?
We're going to get Lucas.

14:41.048 --> 14:42.966
And then we're gonna find Eleven.

14:58.941 --> 15:01.652
Today is a very special day.

15:03.195 --> 15:04.446
Do you know why?

15:07.408 --> 15:10.202
Because today, we make history.

15:11.245 --> 15:14.289
Today, we make contact.

16:06.300 --> 16:07.968
Here you go.

16:08.051 --> 16:10.095
Ah... yum.

16:11.013 --> 16:13.515
Okay.
Now, sweetie, swallow the pancake.

16:14.433 --> 16:16.643
Where is Nancy?
I thought she was coming down.

16:16.727 --> 16:18.937
She is.

16:19.021 --> 16:22.065
Uh, she was.
I don't know.

16:22.149 --> 16:24.526
- Nancy, what's taking so long?

16:24.610 --> 16:26.236
Nancy?

16:26.320 --> 16:28.989
--Nancy, come on.

16:41.627 --> 16:43.170
Nan--

17:08.737 --> 17:10.155
What do you want?

17:14.743 --> 17:17.287
I drew first blood, so...

17:32.386 --> 17:34.388
Okay, I'll shake.

17:35.097 --> 17:36.306
On one condition.

17:36.390 --> 17:38.433
We forget the weirdo
and go straight to the gate.

17:38.517 --> 17:39.935
-Then the deal's off.
-Fine!

17:40.018 --> 17:41.728
- Fine!
- No, no, not fine!

17:41.812 --> 17:43.105
Guys, seriously?

17:44.022 --> 17:46.441
Do you even remember
what happened on the Bloodstone Pass?

17:49.736 --> 17:53.365
We couldn't agree on what path
to take, so we split up the party

17:53.448 --> 17:55.367
and those trolls took us out one by one.

17:55.450 --> 17:58.161
And it all went to shit.
And we were all disabled!

17:58.996 --> 18:01.123
So we stick together, no matter what!

18:01.206 --> 18:06.128
Yeah, I agree. But this is the party,
right here in this room.

18:06.211 --> 18:10.132
-El is one of us now.
-Um, no, she's not. Not even close!

18:10.215 --> 18:12.467
Never will be.
She's a liar, a traitor--

18:12.551 --> 18:14.344
She was just trying to keep us safe!

18:14.428 --> 18:15.971
She didn't mean to hurt you.
It was an accident!

18:16.054 --> 18:17.264
An accident?

18:17.347 --> 18:19.308
All right, accident or not...

18:19.391 --> 18:21.435
-admit it, it was a little awesome.
-Awesome?

18:21.518 --> 18:23.437
Yeah, she threw you in the air
with her mind!

18:23.520 --> 18:25.230
I could have been killed!

18:25.314 --> 18:28.108
Which is exactly why we need her.
She's a weapon!

18:28.191 --> 18:30.360
Do you seriously wanna fight
the Demogorgon with your wrist rocket?

18:30.444 --> 18:32.738
That's like R2-D2
going to fight Darth Vader.

18:32.821 --> 18:34.698
We're no use to Will if we're dead.

18:35.657 --> 18:38.869
If you two wanna waste your time
looking for a traitor, go ahead,

18:38.952 --> 18:42.247
'cause I'm not spending my time
on her anymore. No way!

18:43.707 --> 18:46.710
I'm going to the gate.
I'm gonna find Will.

19:22.454 --> 19:23.497
It's okay, Eleven.

19:23.580 --> 19:27.042
Don't be frightened.
These are all friends.

19:28.502 --> 19:30.212
They're just here to watch.

19:32.297 --> 19:34.091
Don't focus on them.

19:34.174 --> 19:36.718
Stay in here, like before.

19:37.803 --> 19:39.388
Yes, Papa.

19:44.768 --> 19:47.854
Now, remember.
Whatever it is, it can't hurt you.

19:47.938 --> 19:51.525
Not from here.
So there's nothing to be frightened of.

19:53.318 --> 19:54.736
It's reaching out to you...

19:55.654 --> 19:57.656
'cause it wants you.

19:57.739 --> 19:59.366
Hmm?

19:59.449 --> 20:00.659
It's calling you...

20:01.576 --> 20:03.495
so don't turn away from it this time.

20:04.413 --> 20:05.914
I want you to find it.

20:06.832 --> 20:08.083
Understand?

20:09.000 --> 20:10.085
Yes.

20:44.745 --> 20:45.746
Are you lost?

20:49.332 --> 20:50.542
Is your mom here?

20:53.003 --> 20:54.212
Your dad?

20:56.631 --> 20:58.175
Mouth breather.

21:09.853 --> 21:12.314
-What should we do?
-Uh...

21:14.191 --> 21:15.776
Call the police.

21:18.862 --> 21:22.824
Excuse me. Young lady!
You know you have to pay for those!

21:22.908 --> 21:24.618
- Hey! Stop right--

21:24.701 --> 21:26.119
- Please.

21:26.203 --> 21:28.288
You have to pay for those!

21:28.371 --> 21:30.874
Stop right there!
Thief! Thief!

21:57.442 --> 21:58.485
Can I help you?

21:58.568 --> 22:00.612
Hi, we're looking for Terry Ives.
Does she live here?

22:00.695 --> 22:03.657
-Who's asking?
-The Hawkins chief of police.

22:07.536 --> 22:10.372
And you want to talk to my sister?

22:10.455 --> 22:13.291
Well, if your sister's Terry Ives,
then, yeah, we do.

22:15.669 --> 22:16.962
Okay, well, you can come in,

22:17.045 --> 22:19.172
but if you want Terry
to tell you anything,

22:19.256 --> 22:21.341
you're about five years too late.

22:23.927 --> 22:25.804
Terry, you have some visitors.

22:26.972 --> 22:30.433
Hello.
My name's Joyce Byers.

22:30.517 --> 22:33.562
Uh, this is Hopper.
We drove over from Hawkins.

22:33.645 --> 22:37.023
Um, you see, uh, my son...

22:37.107 --> 22:40.360
he's been missing for almost a week now,

22:40.443 --> 22:43.613
and, um, we were wondering
if we could talk to you

22:43.697 --> 22:45.323
about your daughter, Jane?

22:45.407 --> 22:49.411
If there's anything that you could tell us
about when she was taken...

22:50.370 --> 22:52.205
What was your relationship
with Dr. Brenner?

22:53.206 --> 22:54.499
You guys keep in touch?

22:57.127 --> 22:59.212
This is, uh... this is him.

22:59.296 --> 23:01.756
This is Will.

23:01.840 --> 23:04.593
Uh, you may have seen him on...
on the news.

23:04.676 --> 23:06.928
-Uh...
-What's wrong with her?

23:07.012 --> 23:09.723
I told you, you're wasting your time.

23:46.051 --> 23:47.927
This is weird without Lucas.

23:48.011 --> 23:50.889
-He should've shaken my hand.
-He's just jealous.

23:51.514 --> 23:52.932
What are you talking about?

23:54.059 --> 23:57.562
Sometimes, your total
obliviousness just blows my mind.

23:59.439 --> 24:01.441
He's your best friend, right?

24:01.524 --> 24:05.528
-Yeah... I mean, I don't know.
-It's fine. I get it.

24:05.612 --> 24:09.115
I didn't get here until the fourth grade.
He had the advantage of living next door.

24:09.199 --> 24:10.533
But none of that matters.

24:10.617 --> 24:13.286
What matters
is that he is your best friend.

24:13.370 --> 24:15.705
And then this girl shows up
and starts living in your basement,

24:15.789 --> 24:17.666
and all you ever want to do
is pay attention to her.

24:17.749 --> 24:20.251
-That's not true.
-Yes, it is. And you know it.

24:20.335 --> 24:22.921
And he knows it.
But no one ever says anything

24:23.004 --> 24:25.465
until you both start punching
and yelling at each other

24:25.548 --> 24:28.009
like goblins
with intelligence scores of zero.

24:28.093 --> 24:30.762
-Now everything's weird.
-He's not my best friend.

24:30.845 --> 24:34.516
- Yeah, right.
- I mean, he is, but so are you.

24:34.599 --> 24:37.018
-And so is Will.
-Can't have more than one best friend.

24:37.102 --> 24:38.812
-Says who?
-Says logic.

24:38.895 --> 24:42.482
Well, I call bull on your logic,
because you're my best friend, too.

24:43.483 --> 24:44.526
Okay.

24:49.155 --> 24:50.156
Whoa.

24:50.240 --> 24:52.534
--You don't think...

24:52.617 --> 24:55.036
Uh... definitely.

25:08.883 --> 25:10.218
Are you ready?

25:10.301 --> 25:13.054
She was a part of some study
in college.

25:13.138 --> 25:15.515
-MK Ultra?
-Yeah, that's the one.

25:15.598 --> 25:19.352
Was, uh, started in the '50s.

25:19.436 --> 25:20.854
By the time Terry got involved,

25:20.937 --> 25:24.149
it was supposed to be ramping down,
but the drugs just got crazier.

25:24.232 --> 25:25.775
Messed her up good.

25:25.859 --> 25:28.194
This was the CIA that ran this?

25:30.071 --> 25:33.908
You and Terry would've gotten along.
"The Man," with a big capital "M."

25:33.992 --> 25:35.452
They'd pay... you know,

25:35.535 --> 25:38.496
a couple hundred bucks
to people like my sister,

25:38.580 --> 25:42.250
give 'em drugs, psychedelics.
LSD, mostly.

25:42.333 --> 25:46.129
And then they'd strip her naked
and put her in these isolation tanks.

25:46.212 --> 25:48.047
- Isolation tanks?
- Yeah.

25:48.131 --> 25:50.175
These big bathtubs, basically,

25:50.258 --> 25:52.886
filled with salt water,
so you can float around in there.

25:52.969 --> 25:55.638
You lose any sense of, uh...

25:55.722 --> 25:59.517
sense and feel nothing, see nothing.

25:59.601 --> 26:02.896
They wanted to expand
the boundaries of the mind.

26:02.979 --> 26:04.355
Real hippie crap.

26:04.439 --> 26:07.025
I... I mean, it's not like they were
forcing her to do any of this stuff.

26:07.108 --> 26:08.359
The thing is, though, is that

26:08.443 --> 26:10.528
she didn't know
she was pregnant at the time.

26:10.612 --> 26:12.113
Jane.

26:15.700 --> 26:17.994
Do you have any pictures of her?

26:20.789 --> 26:23.082
I don't think you guys understand.

26:24.000 --> 26:26.377
Terry miscarried in the third trimester.

26:31.674 --> 26:34.594
She keeps all of this up.
Been doing it for 12 years.

26:36.721 --> 26:40.683
Terry, uh, pretends like Jane is real,

26:40.767 --> 26:43.561
- like she's gonna come home someday.

26:43.645 --> 26:48.107
Says she's special.
Born with "abilities."

26:49.442 --> 26:50.985
Abilities?

26:53.947 --> 26:55.657
You read any Stephen King?

27:00.954 --> 27:03.289
You guys look scared, actually.

27:03.373 --> 27:06.209
I mean, it's all make-believe.

27:07.085 --> 27:09.128
What... what kind of abilities?

27:09.212 --> 27:11.923
Telepathy, telekinesis...

27:13.716 --> 27:15.802
You know, shit you can do with your mind.

27:16.761 --> 27:19.848
That's why the big, bad Man
stole Jane away.

27:19.931 --> 27:21.391
Papa!

27:21.474 --> 27:24.477
Her baby's a weapon,
off fighting the commies.

27:24.561 --> 27:28.731
You know, the doctors all say
it's a coping mechanism.

27:28.815 --> 27:30.525
You know, to deal with the guilt.

27:30.608 --> 27:33.570
Do you think there is any chance
she could be telling the truth?

27:34.696 --> 27:36.948
About having had the kid.

27:37.031 --> 27:39.826
There is no birth certificate,
nothing from the hospital.

27:39.909 --> 27:42.996
Doctors and nurses
all confirm that she miscarried.

27:43.079 --> 27:46.249
Yeah, but that could've been covered up.
Right?

27:46.958 --> 27:50.253
Like I said, you and Terry
would've gotten along.

28:12.275 --> 28:14.360
Oh, man.

29:04.035 --> 29:07.121
And I'll have four boxes of the .38s.

29:14.545 --> 29:17.006
What you kids doin' with all this?

29:17.090 --> 29:18.424
Um...

29:21.344 --> 29:24.305
- Monster hunting.
- Huh.

29:27.433 --> 29:28.685
"Monster hunting"?

29:31.562 --> 29:33.064
You know, last week...

29:33.690 --> 29:36.985
I was shopping for a new top
I thought Steve might like.

29:37.068 --> 29:38.903
It took me and Barb all weekend.

29:38.987 --> 29:42.865
It seemed like life or death, you know?
And... and now--

29:42.949 --> 29:45.493
You're shopping for bear traps
with Jonathan Byers.

29:46.411 --> 29:47.537
Yeah.

29:48.746 --> 29:50.039
What's the weirdest part?

29:50.957 --> 29:52.375
Me or the bear trap?

29:53.293 --> 29:55.628
You.
It's definitely you.

29:57.213 --> 29:58.965
--Hey, Nance!

29:59.841 --> 30:02.552
Can't wait to see your movie.

30:02.635 --> 30:04.012
What the hell was that?

30:05.471 --> 30:06.806
I don't know.

30:10.435 --> 30:11.561
What?

30:14.147 --> 30:15.773
What?

30:15.857 --> 30:17.442
Hey! Where are you going?

30:18.234 --> 30:21.779
--Nancy, wait!

30:25.491 --> 30:26.659
Nancy!

30:33.791 --> 30:36.210
- I can't believe it.
- These kids!

30:37.253 --> 30:38.629
- Jesus.

30:41.716 --> 30:43.051
Wow.

30:48.306 --> 30:49.349
Wait!

30:49.432 --> 30:51.017
Tommy,
you write like a three-year-old.

30:51.100 --> 30:53.061
- Shut up!
- I didn't know you could spell.

31:00.234 --> 31:02.111
Aw, hey there, princess!

31:02.904 --> 31:04.781
Uh-oh! She looks upset.

31:07.241 --> 31:08.326
- Oh!
- Damn!

31:08.409 --> 31:09.744
What is wrong with you?

31:09.827 --> 31:11.120
What's wrong with me?
What's wrong with you?

31:11.204 --> 31:12.747
I was worried about you.

31:12.830 --> 31:14.916
I can't believe that I was
actually worried about you.

31:14.999 --> 31:18.252
-What are you talking about?
-I wouldn't lie if I were you.

31:18.336 --> 31:21.506
You don't want to be known
as the lying slut now, do you?

31:21.589 --> 31:22.799
Speak of the devil.

31:24.092 --> 31:25.134
Hi.

31:26.803 --> 31:27.970
You came by last night?

31:28.471 --> 31:31.557
Ding! Ding! Ding!
Does she get a prize?

31:31.641 --> 31:34.394
Look, I don't know what you think you saw,
but it wasn't like that.

31:34.477 --> 31:37.855
What, you just let him into your room
to... study?

31:37.939 --> 31:40.525
Or for another
pervy photo session?

31:40.608 --> 31:42.151
- We were just--
- You were just what?

31:42.235 --> 31:43.820
Finish that sentence.

31:45.947 --> 31:48.783
Finish the sentence.

31:55.373 --> 31:57.291
Go to hell, Nancy.

31:58.042 --> 31:59.502
Come on, Nancy, let's just leave.

31:59.585 --> 32:01.129
You know what, Byers?
I'm actually kind of impressed.

32:01.212 --> 32:02.755
I always took you for a queer,
but I guess you're just

32:02.839 --> 32:04.841
a little screw-up like your father.

32:04.924 --> 32:07.593
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Yeah, that house is full of screw-ups.

32:07.677 --> 32:09.178
You know, I guess I shouldn't
really be surprised.

32:09.262 --> 32:10.471
A bunch of screw-ups in your family.

32:10.555 --> 32:11.722
-Jonathan, leave it.
-I mean, your mom...

32:11.806 --> 32:13.641
I'm not even surprised
what happened to your brother.

32:13.724 --> 32:14.767
Steve, shut up!

32:14.851 --> 32:15.852
I'm sorry I have to be
the one to tell you,

32:15.935 --> 32:17.728
but the Byers, their family,
it's a disgrace to the entire--

32:21.691 --> 32:23.276
--Steve!

32:23.359 --> 32:25.027
- Oh!

32:25.111 --> 32:26.696
- Steve.

32:27.613 --> 32:29.532
Stop! Steve!
Knock it off, you guys!

32:29.615 --> 32:31.701
- Get off of him, seriously!
- Kick his ass, man!

32:31.784 --> 32:33.161
- Get off! Stop!

32:34.912 --> 32:36.497
-Get in there, he's going to hurt himself!
-Easy, easy!

32:36.581 --> 32:39.333
Hey. Hey! Get out of here!
Get out of here! Get out of here!

32:43.296 --> 32:45.756
Jonathan, stop!
Stop! You're going to hurt him!

32:45.840 --> 32:47.800
- Jonathan, stop!

32:47.884 --> 32:50.011
- Cops!
- Guys-- Jonathan, get off of him!

32:50.094 --> 32:52.263
- Stop it!
- Cops! Come on!

32:52.346 --> 32:54.265
-Stop it! Come on!
-Cops!

32:54.348 --> 32:56.517
-You have to stop!
-Just go, Carol!

32:56.601 --> 32:58.060
- Stop it!

32:58.144 --> 32:59.770
Hey, he's had enough, man!
I said he's had enough!

32:59.854 --> 33:01.606
-Kids! All right!
-Stop it!

33:03.107 --> 33:04.692
Oh! My nose!

33:04.775 --> 33:06.569
Calm him down!

33:06.652 --> 33:09.238
--Go, go, go, go, go, go!

33:09.322 --> 33:13.201
Hey! Hey, uh-uh. Uh-uh.
Come here, little guys! Come here!

33:13.284 --> 33:14.869
- Get off!
- I got this one!

33:14.952 --> 33:17.872
Get back here!
Get back here, you little punks!

33:24.504 --> 33:26.923
Good gift for a college student...

33:33.304 --> 33:35.056
Well, thank you for your time.
We appreciate it.

33:35.139 --> 33:37.266
Hmm, yeah,
I'm sorry I couldn't be of more help.

33:40.144 --> 33:42.480
- Good luck.
- Thank you.

33:50.196 --> 33:51.280
Hey...

33:52.365 --> 33:53.908
What?

33:54.575 --> 33:56.035
We're gonna find him.

33:58.162 --> 34:01.249
Yeah, like Terry found her daughter?

34:02.708 --> 34:04.126
We're close.

34:04.210 --> 34:09.215
Twelve years?
Twelve years she's been looking for her--

34:09.298 --> 34:10.967
And then she shows up
at Benny's five nights ago,

34:11.050 --> 34:12.260
which means we've got a chance.

34:12.343 --> 34:14.053
You know what I would give?

34:15.096 --> 34:17.348
For a chance?

34:17.431 --> 34:19.141
You know what I would give?

34:20.059 --> 34:21.561
Hey, Chief, you there?

34:21.686 --> 34:23.854
-Hey, Chief?
-Yeah, go ahead.

34:23.980 --> 34:25.731
Yeah, a fight broke out here and--

34:25.815 --> 34:29.026
-Cal, I don't have time for this.
-It's Jonathan Byers.

34:29.110 --> 34:31.153
You haven't seen Joyce, have you?

34:43.666 --> 34:45.960
Do you think we'll be out of here soon?

34:46.043 --> 34:48.170
You, yes. Him, no.

34:48.254 --> 34:50.506
He assaulted a police officer.

34:50.590 --> 34:52.842
--Well, how long are you gonna keep him?

34:52.925 --> 34:55.094
You and your boyfriend
have big plans, do you?

34:55.177 --> 34:57.388
He's not my boyfriend.

34:57.471 --> 34:59.974
I think you better tell him that.

35:00.683 --> 35:01.726
What?

35:01.809 --> 35:04.562
Only love makes you that crazy,
sweetheart.

35:05.605 --> 35:07.481
And that damn stupid.

35:15.990 --> 35:17.325
Found some ice.

35:19.702 --> 35:20.870
Thanks.

35:34.634 --> 35:35.968
Everything okay?

35:37.720 --> 35:38.846
Yeah.

35:39.972 --> 35:41.557
Everything's fine.

35:54.654 --> 35:56.489
El!

35:58.658 --> 36:00.409
Eleven!

36:02.953 --> 36:05.748
-Eleven! El!
-El!

36:07.041 --> 36:08.626
Eleven!

36:08.709 --> 36:09.919
Eleven!

36:12.922 --> 36:15.800
-Hey, stop. Do you hear that?
-What?

36:15.883 --> 36:16.967
El!

36:17.968 --> 36:19.011
El?

36:23.516 --> 36:24.809
Hey, there, Frogface.

36:25.726 --> 36:26.769
Toothless.

36:26.852 --> 36:28.729
Shit! Run, Mike!

36:28.813 --> 36:30.856
-What?
-Run! Come on!

36:31.691 --> 36:33.109
You're dead, Wheeler.

36:33.192 --> 36:34.902
Move, Mike!

36:34.985 --> 36:36.570
Mike, come on, run!

37:53.773 --> 37:55.733
Cramp!

37:55.816 --> 37:57.485
- Just keep going!

37:57.568 --> 37:58.736
Keep going!

38:04.867 --> 38:06.327
Shit!

38:08.037 --> 38:10.206
-Stay back!
-Don't come any closer!

38:12.792 --> 38:15.419
--Nice throw, numbnuts.

38:18.756 --> 38:20.424
--Get off! Get off me!

38:20.508 --> 38:22.384
Let him go! Let him go!

38:22.468 --> 38:25.429
-Stay back, or I cut him!
-What do you want?

38:25.513 --> 38:26.722
I want to know how you did it!

38:26.806 --> 38:28.098
- How I did what?

38:28.182 --> 38:29.475
I know you did something to me.

38:29.558 --> 38:31.435
Some nerdy science shit
to make me do that.

38:31.560 --> 38:32.770
You mean piss your pants?

38:33.854 --> 38:35.439
Our friend has superpowers,

38:35.523 --> 38:37.942
and she squeezed your tiny bladder
with her mind.

38:38.025 --> 38:39.401
- Shut up!

38:39.485 --> 38:41.821
I think I should save Toothless here
a trip to the dentist.

38:41.904 --> 38:43.614
Help him lose the rest of his baby teeth.

38:43.697 --> 38:45.533
Let him go.
Let him go!

38:45.616 --> 38:47.827
I'll let him go, sure.

38:47.910 --> 38:50.204
- But first... it's your turn.

38:50.287 --> 38:51.413
My turn for what?

38:51.497 --> 38:53.123
Wet yourself.

38:53.958 --> 38:55.960
-What?
-Jump...

38:56.043 --> 38:58.504
or Toothless here
gets an early trip to the dentist.

38:58.587 --> 38:59.922
Stop! No!

39:04.552 --> 39:05.719
I'll cut him right now!

39:08.222 --> 39:10.683
All right, just hold on!
Hold on!

39:10.766 --> 39:13.102
Mike, don't do it.
I don't need my baby teeth, Mike!

39:13.185 --> 39:15.062
Mike, seriously, don't!

39:33.330 --> 39:34.832
Mike, don't do it!

39:34.915 --> 39:37.751
Seriously, don't do it, man!
Seriously, don't!

39:37.835 --> 39:39.712
Troy, I don't think
this is a good idea, man.

39:40.588 --> 39:42.172
Mike, don't!

39:42.256 --> 39:45.885
- Dentist's office opens in five...

39:45.968 --> 39:48.387
Four! Three!

39:50.139 --> 39:52.266
-Two!
-Mike!

39:52.349 --> 39:53.350
One!

40:02.902 --> 40:04.111
Holy shit.

40:14.163 --> 40:17.082
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

40:45.486 --> 40:47.863
She broke my arm! My arm!

40:47.947 --> 40:48.989
Go.

40:50.199 --> 40:52.910
- Let's get out of here! Let's go!
- Go!

40:52.993 --> 40:54.912
Yeah, that's right!
You better run!

40:55.663 --> 40:58.123
She's our friend and she's crazy!

40:58.207 --> 41:00.584
You come back here and she'll kill you!

41:00.668 --> 41:04.630
You hear me?
She'll kill you, you sons of bitches!

41:04.713 --> 41:06.757
She'll kill you, you hear me?

42:22.833 --> 42:24.168
El, are you okay?

42:24.251 --> 42:25.836
El?

42:26.879 --> 42:29.673
Mike... I'm sorry.

42:29.757 --> 42:32.217
Sorry? What are you sorry for?

42:33.260 --> 42:34.678
The gate...

42:38.557 --> 42:39.975
I opened it.

42:43.645 --> 42:45.064
I'm the monster.

42:46.482 --> 42:49.151
No. No, El, you're not the monster.

42:49.234 --> 42:50.819
You saved me.

42:50.903 --> 42:53.781
Do you understand?
You saved me.

43:33.654 --> 43:37.324
I have eyes on 'em now.
They're heading home.
