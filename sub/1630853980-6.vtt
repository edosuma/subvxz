WEBVTT

00:08.300 --> 00:10.010
I want men posted at their church

00:10.093 --> 00:12.262
and each of their homes
in case they return.

00:12.346 --> 00:15.641
I don't believe the Witchfinders will be
returning home anytime soon.

00:15.724 --> 00:17.518
You've outlawed their beliefs.

00:17.601 --> 00:20.979
Well, their beliefs have been outlawed
in all of Paya. Where will they go?

00:22.397 --> 00:23.398
It's a big kingdom.

00:24.691 --> 00:29.404
My guess is the outer-lying towns,
Lebnin, Altoona,

00:29.488 --> 00:31.615
they'll find a more sympathetic haven.

00:32.198 --> 00:35.035
Have Lords Diego and Torrance sent word?
I want them found.

00:35.118 --> 00:36.703
Already did.

00:36.787 --> 00:40.332
Perhaps we'll have news.
The council is already assembled.

00:40.415 --> 00:42.292
Any word on my family?

00:42.376 --> 00:45.379
Even if everything at
the House of Enlightenment went perfectly,

00:45.462 --> 00:46.797
they wouldn't be back yet.

00:47.881 --> 00:49.550
When does anything go perfectly?

00:56.515 --> 00:58.642
You said the council
had already assembled?

00:59.142 --> 01:00.143
It has.

01:02.104 --> 01:03.397
Why don't I hear them?

01:11.488 --> 01:12.739
I smell blood.

01:40.350 --> 01:41.351
Is it all of them?

01:43.020 --> 01:44.188
I think so.

01:56.074 --> 01:57.576
Lord Diego.

02:06.710 --> 02:07.920
Witchfinders.

02:08.503 --> 02:11.507
Blood is still warm.
Let's get you somewhere safe.

03:51.064 --> 03:54.735
-Okay, this isn't gonna work.
-What are you talking about?

03:55.527 --> 03:57.613
We don't just need to get to Pennsa
before Tormada.

03:57.696 --> 04:00.157
We gotta get there
with enough time to build an army,

04:00.240 --> 04:02.701
fortify defenses, come up with a plan.

04:02.784 --> 04:04.161
You know a faster way?

04:04.244 --> 04:06.246
Well, yes, actually I do.

04:08.332 --> 04:10.959
There's another route
sometimes used by smugglers.

04:11.752 --> 04:13.754
Why are you only saying this now?

04:15.005 --> 04:16.507
'Cause it's dangerous, okay?

04:17.798 --> 04:20.344
But it'll save us an entire day.
Maybe two.

04:20.427 --> 04:25.015
You wanna take 'em through the lowlands?
Yeah, you're crazy.

04:25.516 --> 04:26.808
What are these lowlands?

04:26.892 --> 04:32.773
They aren't on any maps.
And the terrain is tricky.

04:32.856 --> 04:35.192
-What do you mean "tricky"?
-We've lost men there.

04:35.692 --> 04:37.194
-Lost them? How?
-We don't know.

04:37.277 --> 04:39.071
-There are spirits.
-Not that.

04:39.571 --> 04:42.950
Okay, it's not ideal,
but it's the fastest way back.

04:43.033 --> 04:45.327
And there are seven of us.
Three of us have sight.

04:45.410 --> 04:47.871
I've made it through many times
with far less.

04:49.456 --> 04:50.624
How many times?

04:55.879 --> 04:56.880
Twice.

04:59.675 --> 05:01.134
You'll lead the way.

05:01.718 --> 05:06.056
Yeah, right. Punish the one with the plan.

05:22.364 --> 05:25.033
How did we let these Witchfinders
get past our defenses?

05:25.117 --> 05:28.829
It wasn't a lot of them.
Three or four is all it would've taken.

05:29.413 --> 05:31.498
Those were largely defenseless civilians.

05:32.082 --> 05:33.333
I did this.

05:33.917 --> 05:34.918
Maghra.

05:35.002 --> 05:37.171
I had them in my hands,
moments from the hangman.

05:37.254 --> 05:39.339
And I just let them go.

05:39.423 --> 05:40.507
You showed mercy.

05:40.591 --> 05:43.385
My mercy just killed our entire council.

05:51.143 --> 05:52.477
My sister was right.

05:55.522 --> 05:59.401
Violence must be met with violence.

06:02.196 --> 06:04.615
I'm gonna find these Witchfinders.

06:05.490 --> 06:08.327
They are murderers, and they will pay.

06:09.578 --> 06:14.374
I only ask you leave this with me.
Your hands should stay clean.

06:14.458 --> 06:15.876
It's too late for that.

06:56.708 --> 06:59.086
Whoa, whoa! Whoa.

07:00.879 --> 07:05.384
Welcome, Councillor.
Made exceptional time.

07:06.885 --> 07:10.722
I received word you managed to lose
an entire battalion to one man.

07:11.390 --> 07:12.891
A man you said you killed.

07:13.767 --> 07:17.229
Yes, yes, yes. Baba Voss.

07:17.312 --> 07:19.398
All my fault, lesson learned and so on.

07:19.481 --> 07:22.317
But why talk about past mistakes

07:22.401 --> 07:24.611
when we can talk about
how many soldiers you brought me?

07:24.695 --> 07:28.156
Pathetically few. I had to be careful.

07:28.699 --> 07:30.742
Until I've bought
the loyalties of the generals,

07:30.826 --> 07:32.661
I cannot reveal my part in all of this.

07:33.412 --> 07:34.663
Reasonable calculation.

07:34.746 --> 07:38.166
Maybe. But we're a regiment short.

07:38.834 --> 07:40.544
Can we still take Pennsa?

07:41.628 --> 07:45.174
You still underestimate
the power of my bombs.

07:47.384 --> 07:50.512
I'm concerned about
having enough soldiers to place them.

07:50.596 --> 07:52.389
Soldiers are no longer required.

07:52.890 --> 07:56.643
We've built machines that can
launch these bombs great distances.

07:57.811 --> 08:01.481
-You've tested these machines?
-You insult me.

08:03.567 --> 08:05.319
And the sighted children?

08:05.402 --> 08:07.446
How will you continue to operate
without them?

08:07.529 --> 08:10.574
We'll find them.
And there are other sighted ones in play.

08:10.657 --> 08:13.243
In the meantime,
we have more than enough ammunition

08:13.327 --> 08:16.079
to flatten the entire Payan kingdom.

08:17.623 --> 08:21.668
Well, then,
I suppose you should proceed to Pennsa.

08:22.794 --> 08:23.837
You have my troops.

08:24.338 --> 08:26.757
-For which, you have my thanks.
-Commander.

08:27.508 --> 08:28.884
Join ranks!

08:28.967 --> 08:30.302
Back home?

08:30.385 --> 08:34.097
Yes. I have an empire in crisis to manage.

08:34.597 --> 08:36.308
And you have a kingdom to conquer.

08:40.395 --> 08:41.563
Safe travels.

09:14.638 --> 09:20.602
Harlan, in a lifetime of bad ideas,
this is the worst.

09:21.311 --> 09:24.731
Yeah. There's no turning back now.

09:27.276 --> 09:29.278
You should talk to your sister.

09:29.903 --> 09:31.280
She shot a gun at me.

09:33.115 --> 09:38.453
Kofun, do you know why your mother will be
a far better queen than Sibeth?

09:39.872 --> 09:42.040
No. 'Cause she's not crazy?

09:44.042 --> 09:45.210
'Cause she has compassion.

09:46.420 --> 09:47.713
I could never be king

09:47.796 --> 09:51.633
'cause my compassion is less powerful
than my instinct to fight.

09:52.676 --> 09:55.304
Maybe that's what makes a good warrior.
I don't know.

09:55.387 --> 09:58.473
But what I do know is
that you are your mother's son.

09:59.308 --> 10:02.728
You have had her compassion
and wisdom from a young age.

10:03.812 --> 10:07.399
I know you think that makes you soft,
but it makes you stronger.

10:09.151 --> 10:12.029
Like your mother.
You'll make a great king.

10:15.240 --> 10:16.450
What?

10:16.533 --> 10:18.869
What are you talking about?
I'm not gonna be king.

10:19.536 --> 10:20.913
Spoken like a true prince.

10:22.372 --> 10:24.791
Please, go talk to your sister.

10:27.461 --> 10:29.004
It's not gonna work.

10:29.087 --> 10:30.339
That's the spirit, boy.

10:35.302 --> 10:36.303
Hey.

10:38.263 --> 10:40.265
-I'll leave the two of you alone.
-Wren.

10:41.433 --> 10:44.144
-We have to talk at some point.
-Do we?

10:45.896 --> 10:49.358
It wasn't just me, you know.
Mom and Dad wanted it gone too.

10:50.984 --> 10:53.987
The knowledge stored in that place
could've changed the world.

10:54.071 --> 10:57.616
You think I don't know that?
Haniwa, they were building bombs.

10:57.699 --> 11:00.702
They are building bombs. Not us.

11:02.120 --> 11:03.288
We would be different.

11:04.831 --> 11:06.667
You were pretty quick to pick up that gun.

11:09.086 --> 11:11.505
I'm sorry. That was a mistake.

11:11.588 --> 11:13.173
Yeah, it was a pretty big mistake.

11:13.257 --> 11:16.552
Please, as if you haven't
made mistakes. Sibeth.

11:21.557 --> 11:23.892
Papa, what is it?

11:24.935 --> 11:26.103
We're not alone.

11:26.728 --> 11:28.397
This fucking place.

11:41.326 --> 11:42.411
I saw someone.

11:44.121 --> 11:45.330
There's another.

11:47.958 --> 11:49.042
There are more.

11:50.878 --> 11:52.087
At least six.

11:56.675 --> 11:59.344
We can handle six. Right?

12:02.264 --> 12:03.265
Hello!

12:04.057 --> 12:06.018
We're passing through.
We mean you no harm.

12:08.228 --> 12:11.481
Butâ€¦ we are heavily armed.

12:16.278 --> 12:17.362
They have dogs.

12:19.364 --> 12:20.699
Those aren't dogs.

12:23.952 --> 12:26.121
Whoa! Shit.

12:35.839 --> 12:36.673
Guntar!

13:24.805 --> 13:26.139
Fuck! Shit! No!

13:33.063 --> 13:35.065
Fuck! Fuck! Fuck!

13:36.859 --> 13:37.860
Fuck.

14:06.889 --> 14:09.433
-Kofun. Are you hurt?
-No.

14:10.976 --> 14:12.144
Where's Haniwa?

14:18.734 --> 14:20.694
Get the fuck off!

14:20.777 --> 14:22.613
Haniwa!

14:48.847 --> 14:49.932
Haniwa.

15:00.108 --> 15:01.485
Baba!

15:01.568 --> 15:03.737
-Where is she?
-They took her.

15:03.820 --> 15:04.821
She's gone.

15:36.353 --> 15:37.563
Whoa.

15:39.523 --> 15:40.524
Whoa.

15:44.736 --> 15:46.864
What is it? Why are we stopping?

15:47.823 --> 15:49.867
There's someone on the road, sir.

15:53.245 --> 15:54.079
What is that?

16:02.880 --> 16:04.298
Stand down.

16:05.966 --> 16:07.176
Stand down!

16:10.888 --> 16:13.015
Who are you? What do you want?

16:14.516 --> 16:16.101
I'm seeking Tormada.

16:17.895 --> 16:19.146
I am Tormada.

16:22.107 --> 16:23.317
I'll do it.

16:24.067 --> 16:25.235
Get off me.

16:36.580 --> 16:37.623
And who might you be?

16:39.374 --> 16:41.585
Tormada, I am Sibeth Kane.

16:52.513 --> 16:56.934
Your Majesty. It is an honor.

17:05.943 --> 17:07.528
I'd heard you were a smart one.

17:08.694 --> 17:13.367
Now, where are all those wonderful weapons
I've heard so much about?

17:18.163 --> 17:19.414
Is that human bone?

17:21.375 --> 17:22.501
What are these?

17:23.252 --> 17:25.212
I heard stories about this
when I was a boy.

17:25.796 --> 17:29.633
There's a tribe that lives like animals.
Hunting and eating their own kind.

17:30.259 --> 17:33.637
I heard those stories too.
Fucking flesh eaters.

17:34.388 --> 17:36.974
Cannibals. We read about them.

17:38.058 --> 17:40.686
All right, well, what are we gonna do?
We have to find them.

17:40.769 --> 17:42.813
We should split up.
Search the entire area.

17:42.896 --> 17:45.524
No, that's gonna take too long.
We'll be too late.

17:46.108 --> 17:48.861
Maybe not.
They took them alive for a reason.

17:49.444 --> 17:50.696
What are you trying to say?

17:53.240 --> 17:56.159
They keep them alive
so that they don't spoil.

17:58.871 --> 18:02.958
Kofun, I need you to ride back to Pennsa,
tell your mother Tormada's coming.

18:03.041 --> 18:05.586
No. No, I'm not leaving. Haniwa needs me.

18:06.795 --> 18:08.463
So does your son and your mother.

18:08.547 --> 18:10.716
Get on the horse
and ride to Pennsa and warn her now.

18:10.799 --> 18:11.800
Wren, with me.

18:13.969 --> 18:15.137
We're gonna get her back.

18:41.622 --> 18:44.124
-Remend Skelt.
-Who's that?

18:46.585 --> 18:47.836
Tamacti Jun.

18:49.963 --> 18:51.173
Tamacti Jun.

18:51.924 --> 18:54.259
I'd heard of your return from the dead,

18:56.136 --> 19:00.557
and no sooner are you back
than you disband the army that you served.

19:01.058 --> 19:02.893
I serve the queen.

19:03.936 --> 19:07.147
And you have aligned yourself

19:07.898 --> 19:12.986
with those who would undermine her crown.

19:15.447 --> 19:18.951
I'm a simple blacksmith.
I'm not aligned with anyone.

19:21.119 --> 19:22.120
Well, thenâ€¦

19:23.997 --> 19:25.582
it's time you were.

19:26.124 --> 19:27.292
My queen.

19:32.172 --> 19:35.509
Hello. Remend, is it?

19:35.592 --> 19:36.844
Your Majesty.

19:37.928 --> 19:39.680
I'm looking for some Witchfinders.

19:40.305 --> 19:43.392
The Witchfinders have all
been disbanded, my queen.

19:45.686 --> 19:47.646
Are you sure
that's how you want this to go?

19:49.022 --> 19:50.399
Tamacti Jun.

20:04.329 --> 20:07.708
-Where are they?
-I don't know! I don't!

20:14.423 --> 20:15.799
Put his hand on the table.

20:17.926 --> 20:21.889
This is a whistle sword.

20:22.931 --> 20:24.516
I doubt you've ever made one.

20:25.434 --> 20:28.270
It requires a level of artistry
that few possess.

20:29.479 --> 20:33.066
Its blade is refined
to an almost inhuman level of precision.

20:33.650 --> 20:38.822
These Witchfinders we're looking for
just slaughtered 12 innocent Payans.

20:40.032 --> 20:42.826
If they are not found,
they will keep killing.

20:44.494 --> 20:47.873
So, please,
will you tell us where they are?

20:50.250 --> 20:51.251
I will not.

20:53.170 --> 20:54.338
I understand.

20:59.009 --> 21:01.345
You can probably keep making
your swords without that finger,

21:01.428 --> 21:03.472
but what happens when I take your thumb?

21:04.056 --> 21:05.599
No, fuck!

21:05.682 --> 21:07.726
No! They're at the mason's yard.

21:07.809 --> 21:09.645
There's a house in the back.
They're all in there.

21:13.440 --> 21:14.441
Thank you.

21:19.363 --> 21:23.659
You fucking heretic!
I hope they slit your fucking throat.

21:23.742 --> 21:26.286
You and those bastard witch children!

21:26.370 --> 21:27.871
Take the whole hand.

21:48.016 --> 21:49.184
Yes. This way.

21:52.479 --> 21:54.022
Edo used to track like this.

21:57.192 --> 21:59.862
My father, he was a Slaver.

22:01.321 --> 22:02.906
He taught us to track this way.

22:06.910 --> 22:09.413
Scared men, they leave marks.

22:10.497 --> 22:11.790
They make mistakes.

22:14.626 --> 22:19.214
But these, these thingsâ€¦

22:24.094 --> 22:25.262
have no fear.

22:27.181 --> 22:28.223
You lost it?

22:29.766 --> 22:30.601
Anything?

22:32.686 --> 22:34.021
They leave no trail.

22:41.278 --> 22:42.279
They are hunters.

22:44.781 --> 22:46.074
We will let them hunt us.

22:49.745 --> 22:50.746
Come.

23:04.718 --> 23:08.805
It is Tamacti Jun. We know you're here.

23:11.099 --> 23:12.559
Witchfinder General.

23:14.269 --> 23:16.355
Have you come to rejoin our ranks?

23:17.272 --> 23:20.817
Shiloh. I might have known.

23:23.028 --> 23:24.905
There will be no negotiating here.

23:24.988 --> 23:27.157
I had no intention of negotiating.

23:29.451 --> 23:30.619
They're on the roof.

23:34.081 --> 23:35.165
Get back!

23:44.967 --> 23:47.636
Maghra Kane. Where are you?

23:47.719 --> 23:48.804
I'm right here.

24:27.050 --> 24:28.177
Maghra!

24:35.350 --> 24:36.685
Where are the rest of you?

24:37.227 --> 24:38.520
What are you planning?

24:40.439 --> 24:44.860
You think I would betray
my oath to God for a heretic like you?

24:47.696 --> 24:49.573
You have no authority over them.

24:50.532 --> 24:52.910
They serve a different queen now.

24:53.952 --> 24:56.872
What queen? What are you talking about?

25:01.084 --> 25:02.711
You don't know?

25:07.174 --> 25:12.095
Sibeth and the Witchfinders
will rain God Thunder down

25:12.179 --> 25:14.681
on you and your devil children.

25:21.480 --> 25:26.151
You fight for a kingdom
that is already lost.

25:32.407 --> 25:36.578
You better kill me, Maghra Kane.
Or you will live to regret it.

25:36.662 --> 25:38.622
You're a Witchfinder
who can no longer walk.

25:38.705 --> 25:39.957
You're already dead.

25:41.166 --> 25:43.126
Kill me, you bitch!

25:50.592 --> 25:51.760
Shiloh.

25:53.971 --> 25:55.639
Tamacti Jun.

25:58.267 --> 26:02.688
Give me my honor. Finish me.

26:06.817 --> 26:09.027
Death must be earned, Shiloh.

26:11.071 --> 26:12.573
Trust me, I know.

26:15.409 --> 26:16.577
Kill me!

26:22.833 --> 26:24.585
Kill me!

26:31.091 --> 26:32.092
You're awake.

26:35.095 --> 26:36.096
Where are we?

26:38.015 --> 26:41.351
Well, based on the smell,
I'd say we're in their home.

26:44.021 --> 26:45.230
Smells likeâ€¦

26:51.028 --> 26:52.279
Oh, no.

26:52.362 --> 26:53.906
What? What? What?

26:55.949 --> 26:57.618
They're eating people.

26:58.619 --> 26:59.620
Oh, my God.

27:00.913 --> 27:01.914
Guntar?

27:04.458 --> 27:05.626
Shit.

27:07.753 --> 27:09.129
We have to get out of here.

27:10.422 --> 27:11.715
Yeah.

27:13.467 --> 27:15.302
I've been trying while you were asleep.

27:16.428 --> 27:18.764
They may be animals,
but they know their knots.

27:21.892 --> 27:24.102
Well, they'll come for us.

27:25.521 --> 27:29.525
Haniwa, if they could track us,
they'd be here already.

27:31.026 --> 27:34.196
And there's Pennsa to consider.

27:35.280 --> 27:37.366
-What about it?
-Their first order of business remains.

27:37.449 --> 27:39.910
They gotta get home.
They gotta warn Maghra.

27:42.663 --> 27:44.456
My father won't leave me behind.

27:46.375 --> 27:48.252
Even for the sake of an entire kingdom?

27:50.712 --> 27:52.923
Yes. Even for that.

27:56.468 --> 27:57.678
Wellâ€¦

27:59.429 --> 28:02.516
I guess there is some small comfort
in knowing

28:02.599 --> 28:05.561
that either way, we're dead.

28:17.739 --> 28:19.074
Hey, hey, hey.

28:22.202 --> 28:23.412
-Haniwa?
-Yeah?

28:24.371 --> 28:26.957
You know, we've never really talked.

28:29.042 --> 28:30.335
You're choosing now to start?

28:30.419 --> 28:32.880
I'm sorry,
do you have somewhere you need to be?

28:41.972 --> 28:44.933
Okay. Okay.

28:49.646 --> 28:53.775
Okay. Behind you, there's some
broken glass about an arm's length,

28:53.859 --> 28:55.736
but you're going to have to move.

28:56.653 --> 28:58.071
-Yes.
-Which way, which way?

28:58.155 --> 28:59.448
Further back. Yes.

29:00.365 --> 29:03.702
About half an arm's length now.
Just a bit further.

29:05.996 --> 29:07.748
-Half an arm?
-Yes.

29:09.166 --> 29:10.459
You're very close. Almost there.

29:10.542 --> 29:12.377
-Further, further, further back.
-Okay.

29:12.461 --> 29:14.838
I can't get further. Shit.

29:14.922 --> 29:17.341
Yeah. Yeah, that's close.

29:17.424 --> 29:19.426
-Yeah, almost.
-Okay.

29:20.260 --> 29:21.762
Now he's coming. He's coming.

29:21.845 --> 29:24.598
-Where is it? Where is it?
-Be quiet.

29:24.681 --> 29:26.600
Don't-- Then tell me quietly. Where is it?

29:26.683 --> 29:29.228
He's coming. He's coming.

29:31.230 --> 29:32.439
No, I've got it.

29:32.523 --> 29:34.483
Okay. Fuck.

29:34.566 --> 29:37.611
-No! No!
-Fuck. Fuck.

29:46.453 --> 29:48.413
Lucien, is that you?

29:48.497 --> 29:49.581
Yes, my queen.

29:50.582 --> 29:51.959
We have the Trivantian scientist.

29:53.460 --> 29:54.461
Bring him.

30:04.888 --> 30:06.932
I hear chains. Why is he in chains?

30:07.850 --> 30:09.393
For your safety, Your Majesty.

30:10.602 --> 30:12.729
That is no way to treat
a new friend and ally.

30:13.564 --> 30:14.565
Unbind him.

30:15.607 --> 30:17.401
-My queen.
-Now.

30:22.114 --> 30:23.782
I am so sorry, Tormada.

30:24.575 --> 30:27.953
I suppose our nations have been at odds
for so long,

30:28.036 --> 30:29.454
you can hardly blame Lucien.

30:30.539 --> 30:33.166
If I were you and I'd captured me,
I'd have done the same.

30:34.459 --> 30:39.798
So, Trivantes and Paya are moments away
from a peace treaty,

30:41.133 --> 30:42.718
and you have planned an attack.

30:43.760 --> 30:46.889
A treaty with your sister
wouldn't have given me much peace.

30:49.224 --> 30:51.894
And you're going to war
with only a handful of soldiers.

30:53.770 --> 30:55.355
I'm funny like that.

30:55.439 --> 30:58.108
Yes, I have heard about you.

30:59.902 --> 31:01.278
Your wonderful new weapons,

31:02.529 --> 31:05.782
like thunder from the heavens
tearing apart the earth.

31:06.450 --> 31:08.327
An almost insurmountable advantage.

31:08.410 --> 31:12.497
Though, you don't speak
for all of Trivantes, do you?

31:13.999 --> 31:17.002
No more than you speak
for all of Paya, I suppose.

31:19.087 --> 31:21.840
Tormada, I think

31:21.924 --> 31:26.887
you and I may very well be friends.

31:26.970 --> 31:28.639
And how am I so fortunate?

31:30.265 --> 31:32.559
The enemy of my enemy is my friend.

31:33.769 --> 31:34.770
Or rival.

31:35.812 --> 31:39.316
I find myself wondering how this ends.

31:41.401 --> 31:44.446
If you're careful,
you just might keep your head.

31:44.947 --> 31:46.448
I'm certain I'll keep it.

31:47.407 --> 31:52.162
Because without it,
my bombs are just lumps of Godbone

31:52.246 --> 31:54.248
and of no use to you at all.

31:54.957 --> 31:59.002
And without my bombs,
you'll never reclaim your kingdom.

32:00.587 --> 32:02.422
And without my army,

32:02.506 --> 32:07.886
you'll be vulnerable to attack
from Pennsa and Trivantes alike.

32:09.513 --> 32:12.933
Sounds like the perfect foundation
for a deal to be struck.

32:17.145 --> 32:22.109
Tell me, my queen,
what is it that you want?

32:24.862 --> 32:26.530
I want my father's kingdom back.

32:27.364 --> 32:28.532
But why stop there?

32:29.616 --> 32:34.746
There's a whole world beyond Paya.
That's what I want.

32:36.206 --> 32:40.878
Once Paya is mine, you may use it
as your base to build new weapons,

32:41.795 --> 32:44.506
to expand your empire
as far as your heart desires.

32:45.340 --> 32:48.093
You don't strike me
as someone who likes to share.

32:49.178 --> 32:51.013
Well, not with just anyone.

32:53.223 --> 32:54.516
But a husband.

32:57.686 --> 32:58.812
A king.

33:00.397 --> 33:02.482
-Is that a proposal, Your Highness?
-My queen.

33:02.566 --> 33:04.693
-If so, I accept.
-Wait.

33:04.776 --> 33:07.779
Quiet, Lucien.
Can't you hear we're having a moment?

33:07.863 --> 33:10.824
You can't be serious about
aligning ourselves with a Trivantian.

33:11.533 --> 33:12.910
We cannot trust this man.

33:14.828 --> 33:15.913
Perhaps you're right.

33:18.707 --> 33:19.958
Hand me your sword.

33:21.710 --> 33:23.212
Your Majesty?

33:45.817 --> 33:49.571
What do you say, Tormada? Can I trust you?

33:50.948 --> 33:55.619
It's certainly a gamble.
I'll give you that.

33:57.412 --> 33:59.915
But you strike me
as someone who's spent years

33:59.998 --> 34:02.042
honing her instincts about people.

34:05.629 --> 34:06.797
Indeed, I have.

34:34.533 --> 34:36.368
Thank you for your service.

34:53.467 --> 34:55.387
I ruled alone my entire life.

34:58.974 --> 35:00.142
It's exhausting.

35:03.020 --> 35:04.229
Lonely.

35:07.191 --> 35:09.818
I've just never met anyone
with the stomach for it.

35:12.696 --> 35:15.365
But you seem up to the task.

35:17.034 --> 35:22.122
I am, my queen. I am.

38:17.965 --> 38:19.174
Harlan.

38:21.677 --> 38:22.678
Harlan.

38:32.271 --> 38:33.897
This could be our only chance.

38:42.531 --> 38:43.699
You did it.

38:56.879 --> 38:58.046
Haniwa.

38:59.882 --> 39:00.883
I'm here.

39:03.886 --> 39:04.970
Harlan.

39:13.604 --> 39:14.897
Harlan!

41:59.728 --> 42:01.021
Haniwa.

42:02.105 --> 42:03.273
I'm here.

42:05.859 --> 42:07.486
Okay, okay.

42:12.282 --> 42:13.283
You came back.

42:14.034 --> 42:15.410
I never left.

42:16.537 --> 42:19.665
I just wanted to find something
really heavy to hit the fucker with.

42:31.260 --> 42:34.263
Okay. All right, we got to go.

42:36.890 --> 42:38.934
-Papa.
-Haniwa.

42:41.770 --> 42:43.605
-Are you hurt?
-No.

42:43.689 --> 42:45.482
-Haniwa.
-Where's Harlan?

42:46.108 --> 42:47.818
Almost sound worried about me, Boo-boo.

42:47.901 --> 42:49.528
-Harlan.
-Oh, no.

42:49.611 --> 42:52.072
-Shit. Oh, God.
-Help.

42:52.865 --> 42:54.533
Wasn't as fast as I thought, was I?

42:56.743 --> 42:58.036
His cut is deep.

42:59.580 --> 43:03.458
It's okay. We can stop the bleeding
until we get him to a healer.

43:05.127 --> 43:06.503
Haniwa, g--

43:09.006 --> 43:11.425
Those weren't the last of their kind,
all right?

43:12.009 --> 43:13.594
There are more, and they'll be back,

43:13.677 --> 43:17.181
so all of you are gonna need
to move along pretty quickly.

43:17.264 --> 43:19.057
We are not leaving you here, Harlan.

43:20.309 --> 43:22.936
I don't think you're gonna have
much of a choice.

43:23.020 --> 43:24.104
No.

43:27.858 --> 43:30.861
It's okay. It's okay, it's okay.

43:32.196 --> 43:33.238
It's fine, really.

43:35.365 --> 43:39.953
Listen, I've been taking care of myself
for a long time, all right?

43:41.205 --> 43:43.165
It's nice to take care of someone else.

43:45.876 --> 43:47.753
-Thank you.
-No, thank you.

43:47.836 --> 43:50.422
See, this is nice, huh? Nice.

43:53.383 --> 43:55.552
All right, now listen to me.

43:57.596 --> 43:58.847
When you tell the storyâ€¦

44:00.599 --> 44:02.100
I want you to promise me

44:03.268 --> 44:06.522
you will massively exaggerate my bravery
in the face of certain death.

44:07.648 --> 44:08.857
Okay?

44:08.941 --> 44:11.193
Yes, Harlan, you were very brave.

44:11.276 --> 44:13.862
It's good. It was very good.
Do it exactly like that.

44:17.491 --> 44:18.575
Wait, waitâ€¦

44:25.582 --> 44:27.751
Give this to Maghra, okay?

44:29.378 --> 44:30.587
And tell her thatâ€¦

44:34.258 --> 44:35.384
Yeah, tell herâ€¦

44:36.927 --> 44:37.928
sheâ€¦

44:45.143 --> 44:47.855
It's okay. She knows.

44:50.858 --> 44:52.568
Go. Come on, you gotta go.

44:52.651 --> 44:54.611
Hanging around
waiting for me to die is depressing.

44:54.695 --> 44:57.364
-Harlan.
-It's all right, Haniwa.

44:59.074 --> 45:00.909
Go on. Gotta go. Go.

45:01.702 --> 45:02.703
Fuck.

45:05.080 --> 45:06.081
Fuck.

45:07.875 --> 45:09.042
Shit.

45:16.592 --> 45:17.676
Baba Voss.

45:20.679 --> 45:21.680
Yes, Harlan.

45:28.187 --> 45:30.063
Please don't let them take my city.

45:59.676 --> 46:00.677
Whoa.

46:40.968 --> 46:42.761
I never had to fight for my crown.

46:44.680 --> 46:48.600
I was born into the monarchy,
a queen ordained by God.

46:50.561 --> 46:55.607
I wore the crown,
but it always felt a little light to me.

46:58.026 --> 47:04.199
But now, now that crown will be forged
in the burning flames of war.

47:05.576 --> 47:10.747
And I will be a queen reborn,
anointed by the blood of my enemies.

47:12.207 --> 47:14.418
You have the soul of a poet, my queen.

47:15.794 --> 47:16.879
Are we ready?

47:17.379 --> 47:18.380
We are.

47:18.922 --> 47:21.466
Good. Let's begin.
