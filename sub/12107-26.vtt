18:37.616 --> 18:38.742
- Hey, Lynn.

18:38.826 --> 18:41.036
Say hello to my
not-so-little friend.

18:41.119 --> 18:43.789
- [snowballs thwacking]
- Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha!

18:43.872 --> 18:45.707
Snow day!

18:47.543 --> 18:49.378
- Dang it.
- [wind gusting]

18:49.461 --> 18:51.964
- Hey, guys, I wanna show
you my latest invention:

18:52.047 --> 18:55.175
the ultra snowzooka--
patent pending.

18:55.259 --> 18:56.426
Guys?

18:56.510 --> 18:57.427
Where'd they go?

18:57.511 --> 18:59.096
- Sheesh,
we've created a monster.

18:59.179 --> 19:00.514
- At least we're
safe in here.

19:00.597 --> 19:04.935
- Yeah, it's not like she can
bring snow inside the house.

19:05.018 --> 19:06.228
- [snowballs thwacking]

19:06.311 --> 19:09.106
- LISA: Behold, my latest
latest invention:

19:09.189 --> 19:12.401
indoor snow--
patent pending.

19:12.484 --> 19:16.154
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha!
- OTHERS: [screaming]

19:18.323 --> 19:21.910
{\an8}- Boo-Boo Bear, Lisa is
literally out of control.

19:21.994 --> 19:23.370
{\an8}[panting]

19:23.453 --> 19:26.290
- On the contrary, I've never
felt more in control...

19:26.373 --> 19:28.041
or more alive.

19:28.125 --> 19:31.253
She'll have to call
you back, Boo-Boo Bear.

19:31.336 --> 19:33.463
- I love you.
- [snowballs thwacking]

19:37.885 --> 19:39.177
- LANA: [screams]
- [snowballs thwacking]

19:39.261 --> 19:41.263
- Is nothing sacred?

19:41.346 --> 19:43.473
- Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha,
ha, ha, ha, ha!

19:43.557 --> 19:45.017
- I think we're
safe in here.

19:45.100 --> 19:47.311
- I brought chestnuts
for roasting.

19:47.394 --> 19:48.645
- LISA:
Yoo-hoo?

19:48.729 --> 19:51.815
Here's Jack Frost
nipping at your nose.

19:53.192 --> 19:55.736
- Oh, shoot.
- [snow splats]

19:55.819 --> 19:58.113
- LUCY: That maniac will
never find me here.

19:58.196 --> 19:59.948
- Ah, mind if I join you?

20:00.032 --> 20:02.034
- It's pretty crowded up here
with me and the spirits.

20:02.117 --> 20:04.620
But I think there's room next
to Great Grandma Harriet.

20:04.703 --> 20:06.955
- Whew!
Oh, safe at last.

20:07.039 --> 20:08.916
- [heavy rumbling]

20:08.999 --> 20:10.584
- BOTH:
[scream]

20:10.667 --> 20:12.544
- LUCY: Help me, Grandma!
- [snowball thuds]

20:13.670 --> 20:16.798
- Oh, spirit in the sky,
end this madness.

20:16.882 --> 20:19.009
- Please, please,
no more snow.

20:19.092 --> 20:22.638
- Yeah. I can't take
another day of this.

20:22.721 --> 20:24.973
- [burps]
[giggles]

20:25.057 --> 20:27.184
- How do you reverse
a rabbit's foot?

20:27.267 --> 20:29.811
- Lucky B,
you've gone too far!

20:29.895 --> 20:31.521
- Dudes, it's on!

20:31.605 --> 20:33.857
- Well, no one
saw this coming,

20:33.941 --> 20:37.486
but it looks like we're in for
another foot of snow tonight.

20:37.569 --> 20:38.737
And that's gonna mean--

20:38.820 --> 20:41.657
- ALL: [gasping]
- --school closings!

20:41.740 --> 20:43.325
- ALL:
[groaning]

20:43.408 --> 20:44.868
- Yes-s-s-s!

20:44.952 --> 20:45.744
Thank you, NASA.

20:45.827 --> 20:47.913
Are you punks ready
for tomorrow?

20:47.996 --> 20:50.707
'Cause my snow-powered
tank sure is.

20:50.791 --> 20:52.084
- [remote beeps]

20:52.167 --> 20:54.002
- LOUD KIDS:
No!

20:54.086 --> 20:56.004
- Lisa, please! Enough!

20:56.088 --> 20:58.215
You have to call
off the snow day.

20:58.298 --> 20:59.216
- Sorry, Bub.

20:59.299 --> 21:01.093
Cloud-seeding isn't
exactly reversible.

21:01.176 --> 21:02.844
- Then use your special salt.

21:02.928 --> 21:05.472
{\an8}- But I'm really looking
forward to another snow day.

21:05.555 --> 21:09.434
{\an8}You guys convinced me
they are f-o-n, fun.

21:09.518 --> 21:11.853
{\an8}- I think we've
had enough fun.

21:11.937 --> 21:14.022
{\an8}- Please!
- We've gotta go back to school.

21:14.106 --> 21:15.357
{\an8}- Bring on the learnin'.

21:15.440 --> 21:18.026
{\an8}- Well, I'm quite
crestfallen.

21:18.110 --> 21:20.195
{\an8}But if that
is the consensus,

21:20.278 --> 21:22.531
{\an8}I'll submit to the will
of the majority.

21:22.614 --> 21:25.742
{\an8}- So...going back
to school?

21:27.285 --> 21:30.914
{\an8}S-k-o-o-l! S-k-o-o-l!
- ALL: [cheering]

21:30.998 --> 21:32.040
{\an8}- Thanks, Lise.

21:32.124 --> 21:33.375
{\an8}- No problem, Lincoln.

21:33.458 --> 21:34.751
{\an8}Best get ready for bed.

21:34.835 --> 21:36.712
{\an8}School day tomorrow.

21:37.629 --> 21:39.464
Well, Houston,
mission accomplished.

21:39.548 --> 21:42.009
My master plan
was a major success.

21:42.092 --> 21:42.884
I'm pretty sure my siblings

21:42.968 --> 21:45.137
won't be wanting
any more snow days.

21:45.220 --> 21:48.265
And now that I've repurposed my
snow tank to a salt-spraying,

21:48.348 --> 21:52.936
snow-melting de-icer, it's time
for some real f-u-n--

21:53.020 --> 21:54.479
spelled correctly,
I might add.

21:54.563 --> 21:55.605
- [tank rumbling]

21:55.689 --> 21:57.733
- ALL: [chanting]
School day! School day!

21:57.816 --> 22:00.068
