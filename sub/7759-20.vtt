00:48.449 --> 00:50.318
- IT'S THE FIRST TIME I'VE
EVER SEEN MY WORK IN PRINT.

00:50.351 --> 00:52.286
- THIS WAS JUST A STORY
IN MY HEAD.

00:52.320 --> 00:55.323
- THIS IS SO COOL.

00:55.356 --> 00:56.290
- DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA

00:56.324 --> 00:58.426
HOW MUCH THIS IS GOING TO BE
WORTH SOME DAY?

00:58.459 --> 01:01.295
- LOOK.
STORY BY MICHAEL NOVOTNY.

01:01.329 --> 01:02.596
- ART BY JUSTIN TAYLOR.

01:02.630 --> 01:03.597
[door opening]

01:03.631 --> 01:05.133
- HEY, BOYS.

01:05.166 --> 01:08.502
- HI.

01:08.536 --> 01:11.305
- SO, ARE YOU READY TO SELL
YOUR BABY ON THE OPEN MARKET?

01:11.339 --> 01:12.306
- I HOPE PEOPLE LIKE IT.

01:12.340 --> 01:13.307
- WHY WOULDN'T THEY?

01:13.341 --> 01:16.277
- YOU HAVE NO IDEA
HOW VICIOUS QUEERS CAN BE,

01:16.310 --> 01:18.412
ESPECIALLY WHEN IT COMES TO
SOMEONE ELSE'S SUCCESS.

01:18.446 --> 01:20.614
BUT THAT'S WHY I'VE
INVITED THEM ALL TO A PARTY,

01:20.648 --> 01:22.750
SO THEY'LL FEEL LOVED AND
INCLUDED.

01:22.783 --> 01:24.618
- HOLY SHIT.
- BRIAN.

01:24.652 --> 01:27.288
- I'VE INVITED MEMBERS
OF THE GAY PRESS

01:27.321 --> 01:29.790
AND SET UP SOME INTERVIEWS,

01:29.823 --> 01:32.126
BOUGHT ADVERTISING
IN ALL THE FAG RAGS,

01:32.160 --> 01:33.727
TOP QUEER WEB SITES.

01:33.761 --> 01:35.596
IF WE PLAY THIS RIGHT,

01:35.629 --> 01:37.365
YOU WON'T BE ABLE TO
PEDDLE THESE FAST ENOUGH.

01:37.398 --> 01:39.600
AND THEN WE CAN ALL
RETIRE TO PALM SPRINGS,

01:39.633 --> 01:41.869
WEAR MUUMUUS
AND SIP MIMOSAS.

01:41.902 --> 01:45.173
- IN THE MEANTIME,
I BETTER GET TO CLASS.

01:45.206 --> 01:47.508
- BYE.

01:47.541 --> 01:49.610
- SEE YOU TONIGHT?

01:49.643 --> 01:51.712
- UH, SURE.

02:06.927 --> 02:09.363
- I LOVE YOU.
- ME TOO.

02:09.397 --> 02:10.464
ALWAYS HAVE,

02:10.498 --> 02:13.234
ALWAYS WILL.

02:13.267 --> 02:15.636
- ZEPHYR LOOKS JUST LIKE YOU.

02:15.669 --> 02:18.372
A-AND J.T. LOOKS LIKE JUSTIN.

02:18.406 --> 02:19.873
- AND RAGE IS
THE SPITTING IMAGE OF BRIAN.

02:19.907 --> 02:21.909
- HOW COME, UH,
I'M NOT IN HERE?

02:21.942 --> 02:23.577
WHAT, SUPERHEROES DON'T
HAVE MOTHERS?

02:23.611 --> 02:24.845
- WHO WASHES THEIR TIGHTS?

02:24.878 --> 02:25.846
WHO IRONS THEIR CAPES?

02:25.879 --> 02:26.847
- YEAH.

02:26.880 --> 02:28.182
- BEN, HONEY,

02:28.216 --> 02:29.183
HERE, HAVE
SOME MORE RIGATONI.

02:29.217 --> 02:30.618
- OH, NO, NO, NO.
DEBBIE, REALLY I COULDN'T.

02:30.651 --> 02:31.752
- SURE YOU CAN.

02:31.785 --> 02:33.387
- MA, WOULD YOU STOP
FORCE-FEEDING HIM?

02:33.421 --> 02:34.822
- HE'S ONE OF THE FAMILY NOW.

02:34.855 --> 02:36.724
- EXCUSE ME.
I'M ONE OF THE FAMILY.

02:36.757 --> 02:40.561
- YEAH, MY SINCERE
CONDOLENCES.

02:40.594 --> 02:42.496
- WHAT MICHAEL MEANS IS,

02:42.530 --> 02:43.931
MEMBERSHIP HAS ITS PRIVILEGES.

02:43.964 --> 02:45.333
- YEAH, WHAT,
ARE YOU GOING TO HIT HIM

02:45.366 --> 02:46.334
IN THE HEAD NOW, TOO?

02:46.367 --> 02:49.803
- INCLUDING A TWO-WEEK PACKAGE
IN THE POCONOS.

02:49.837 --> 02:50.904
- MM.

02:50.938 --> 02:51.705
- WE'VE BEEN GOING THERE
EVERY SUMMER

02:51.739 --> 02:53.541
FOR TWO WEEKS
SINCE I WAS NINE.

02:53.574 --> 02:54.775
- YEAH, RIGHT BY THE LAKE.

02:54.808 --> 02:56.510
- IT'S THE PERFECT PLACE
TO RELAX.

02:56.544 --> 02:57.511
- I COOK.

02:57.545 --> 02:59.413
- I SLEEP.
- I CAMP.

02:59.447 --> 03:00.748
- SO WHY DON'T YOU
COME WITH US?

03:00.781 --> 03:03.484
- OH, UH, I WOULD LOVE TO.

03:03.517 --> 03:05.586
UH, IF I'M HERE.

03:05.619 --> 03:06.820
- HERE?
WH--WHERE WOULD YOU BE?

03:06.854 --> 03:08.422
- WELL, I WAS, UH,
ACTUALLY THINKING

03:08.456 --> 03:10.358
ABOUT GOING TO TIBET.

03:10.391 --> 03:11.759
- HONEY, THAT'S A LONG WAY

03:11.792 --> 03:13.294
TO GO FOR A VACATION.

03:13.327 --> 03:15.829
- YEAH, WELL, IT WOULDN'T
EXACTLY BE A VACATION.

03:15.863 --> 03:18.599
UM, SEE THERE'S
THIS BUDDHIST ACADEMY--

03:18.632 --> 03:20.000
IT'S, UH, NEAR LHASA,
THE CAPITAL--

03:20.033 --> 03:21.101
THAT ACCEPTS WESTERNERS.

03:21.134 --> 03:23.304
A FRIEND OF MINE JUST GOT BACK
FROM STUDYING THERE,

03:23.337 --> 03:26.240
SAID IT WAS THE MOST PROFOUND
EXPERIENCE THAT HE'D EVER HAD.

03:26.274 --> 03:27.475
I-IT CHANGED HIS LIFE.

03:27.508 --> 03:28.709
- YEAH, WELL,
NO HEAT,

03:28.742 --> 03:32.980
NO ELECTRICITY,
AND NO TOILET PAPER CAN DO THAT.

03:33.013 --> 03:34.982
- SO YOU'D BE THERE,
LIKE, WHAT?

03:35.015 --> 03:36.350
A COUPLE OF WEEKS, OR--

03:36.384 --> 03:39.587
- UM, WELL,
I-IT'S AN INTENSIVE PROGRAM.

03:39.620 --> 03:43.324
SO IF I DECIDE TO GO, UM,

03:43.357 --> 03:46.360
MORE LIKE SIX MONTHS.

03:53.601 --> 03:55.936
- TIBET?
WHAT'S IN TIBET?

03:55.969 --> 03:57.805
NUDE BEACH?
CIRCUIT PARTY?

03:57.838 --> 03:59.473
- [laughs]

03:59.507 --> 04:01.842
NUDE BEACH
OR A CIRCUIT PARTY.

04:01.875 --> 04:04.545
HE'S SO FUNNY.
YOU ARE SO FUNNY.

04:04.578 --> 04:05.646
- WHAT'D I SAY?

04:05.679 --> 04:07.981
- HE WANTS TO GO
TO A MONASTERY.

04:08.015 --> 04:10.484
- COULD BE HOT.

04:10.518 --> 04:11.919
- HE'LL BE GONE
FOR SIX MONTHS.

04:11.952 --> 04:14.355
- THAT'S A LONG TIME
TO BE CELIBATE.

04:14.388 --> 04:15.356
- WELL, YOU LIVE WITH MONKS,

04:15.389 --> 04:16.490
YOU HAVE TO BE CELIBATE.

04:16.524 --> 04:17.925
- NOT HIM.
YOU.

04:17.958 --> 04:19.760
- LOOK, JUST BECAUSE
HE'S TALKING ABOUT IT

04:19.793 --> 04:21.629
DOESN'T MEAN HE'S ACTUALLY
GOING TO GO THROUGH WITH IT.

04:21.662 --> 04:24.298
- YEAH, ONCE HE REALIZES
THERE'S NO FUCKING,

04:24.332 --> 04:25.633
NO DANCING, NO GYM,

04:25.666 --> 04:26.634
AND THAT YOU HAVE
TO WEAR ORANGE,

04:26.667 --> 04:28.669
WHICH, TRUST ME, NO HUMAN BEING
LOOKS GOOD IN,

04:28.702 --> 04:29.803
NO MATTER HOW SPIRITUAL,

04:29.837 --> 04:31.605
HE'LL FORGET
ALL ABOUT IT.

04:31.639 --> 04:34.642
- EM'S RIGHT.
YOU ARE SO RIGHT.

04:34.675 --> 04:39.046
BESIDES, THERE'S NO WAY
HE'S GOING TO LEAVE HIS HONEY.

04:39.079 --> 04:41.014
- OKAY.
COME ON, LET'S HIT THE SHOWERS.

04:41.048 --> 04:42.015
- PUSSY.

04:42.049 --> 04:44.418
YOU'VE BEEN WORKING OUT
FOR EXACTLY TEN MINUTES.

04:44.452 --> 04:46.787
- WHICH IS THE SAME AS
A TWO HOUR WORKOUT FOR YOU,

04:46.820 --> 04:48.088
MINUS ALL THE TIME YOU SPEND

04:48.121 --> 04:50.758
CRUISING ALL THE GUYS
IN THIS PLACE.

04:50.791 --> 04:54.395
COME ON, EM,
I'LL HIT 'EM WITH YOU.

04:54.428 --> 04:57.698
- SO THIS FRIDAY, MM?

04:57.731 --> 05:01.101
INSTEAD OF GOING CLUB-HOPPING
WITH YOUR BOYFRIEND,

05:01.134 --> 05:06.874
WHY DON'T YOU DRIVE
TO THE COUNTRY WITH ME?

05:06.907 --> 05:09.009
WE'LL PARK UNDER THE STARS,

05:09.042 --> 05:11.412
AND WE'LL WATCH
THE METEOR SHOWER.

05:11.445 --> 05:13.080
- HMM.

05:13.113 --> 05:14.548
I CAN'T.

05:14.582 --> 05:16.817
HE'S GIVING ME A PARTY.

05:16.850 --> 05:18.386
- DON'T TELL ME
HE FINALLY DECIDED

05:18.419 --> 05:21.722
HE BELIEVES
IN BIRTHDAYS.

05:21.755 --> 05:25.325
- NO, IT'S--IT'S
FOR THE COMIC BOOK.

05:29.763 --> 05:32.099
- HE MUST LOVE YOU A LOT.

05:32.132 --> 05:36.904
- IN HIS WAY.

05:36.937 --> 05:40.741
- BUT NOT IN YOURS.

05:51.685 --> 05:55.523
[sighs]

05:55.556 --> 05:56.757
- I HAVE TO GO.

06:14.808 --> 06:17.611
- MY LATEST CD.

06:17.645 --> 06:21.749
YOU'RE THE FIRST PERSON
TO HAVE IT.

06:21.782 --> 06:23.484
- AND YOU USED MY DRAWING.

06:23.517 --> 06:25.886
- CHECK OUT THE BACK.

06:32.493 --> 06:33.961
- "FOR JUSTIN."

06:47.775 --> 06:48.909
- OH, HOLD ON.

06:48.942 --> 06:50.644
- WHAT?
- YOUR BACK'S STILL WET.

06:50.678 --> 06:52.680
LET ME DRY YOU OFF.

06:52.713 --> 06:54.482
AHH, WELL, EM,

06:54.515 --> 06:57.585
YOU'VE REALLY GOTTEN YOURSELF
INTO GREAT SHAPE.

06:57.618 --> 07:00.654
YOUR BACK IS
AS BROAD AS TEXAS,

07:00.688 --> 07:02.723
YOUR STOMACH
AS FLAT AS KANSAS,

07:02.756 --> 07:05.092
AND FLORIDA'S LOVELY
THIS TIME OF YEAR.

07:05.125 --> 07:07.528
- WELL, LET'S JUST STOP BEFORE
WE GET TO THE GRAND CANYON.

07:07.561 --> 07:09.530
- [laughs]

07:09.563 --> 07:12.466
GOD, YOU ARE SO FUNNY.

07:12.500 --> 07:15.536
SO, WHAT ARE YOU DOING NOW?

07:15.569 --> 07:17.137
- PUTTING ON MY SHIRT.

07:17.170 --> 07:19.673
- [chuckles]

07:19.707 --> 07:21.942
NO, I MEANT--
I MEANT AFTER.

07:21.975 --> 07:23.811
- WELL, I THOUGHT
I MIGHT TRY WORKING.

07:23.844 --> 07:26.614
SOME OF US FORMER MILLIONAIRES
HAVE TO, YOU KNOW.

07:26.647 --> 07:28.949
- WELL, I MIGHT STOP BY.
TAKE YOU OUT TO LUNCH.

07:28.982 --> 07:31.819
- HONEY, YOU'VE ALREADY TAKEN ME
OUT TO LUNCH TWICE THIS WEEK.

07:31.852 --> 07:34.522
AND BREAKFAST
AND DINNER.

07:34.555 --> 07:38.125
- TREATING YOU IS MY TREAT.

07:46.567 --> 07:49.537
[violin playing]

07:49.570 --> 07:57.511
*

08:28.876 --> 08:29.843
- HEY!

08:29.877 --> 08:33.881
EXCUSE ME, SIR?

08:33.914 --> 08:36.884
YOU, UH, YOU DROPPED $100
IN MY CASE.

08:36.917 --> 08:38.752
- IT SAYS YOU'RE STARVING.

08:38.786 --> 08:42.022
- YEAH, WELL, I'M MORE LIKE
A LITTLE HUNGRY.

08:42.055 --> 08:43.757
- YOU ARE A STUDENT?

08:43.791 --> 08:45.926
- YOU WANT TO SEE MY I.D.?

08:45.959 --> 08:47.595
- YOU'RE GOOD.
- I KNOW.

08:47.628 --> 08:48.629
- SO WHY ARE YOU
WASTING YOUR TIME

08:48.662 --> 08:50.030
STANDING ON THE STREET,

08:50.063 --> 08:51.732
PLAYING FOR NICKELS
AND DIMES?

08:51.765 --> 08:53.133
- WELL, DO I LOOK LIKE 'N SYNC?

08:53.166 --> 08:55.168
I'M NOT EXACTLY GOING TO BE
SELLING OUT MELLON ARENA.

08:55.202 --> 08:57.204
- THERE ARE OTHER WAYS
TO MAKE MONEY.

08:57.237 --> 08:59.807
COUPLE THOUSAND, AT LEAST.

08:59.840 --> 09:02.142
- DOING WHAT?

09:02.175 --> 09:05.112
- I'M FREEZING.
I'M GOING TO GO GET SOME COFFEE.

09:09.316 --> 09:13.954
- RAGE IS NOW REQUIRED READING
FOR PROFESSOR BRUCKNER'S CLASS.

09:13.987 --> 09:15.956
- I GUESS IT PAYS TO BE
THE TEACHER'S BOYFRIEND.

09:15.989 --> 09:18.158
- THAT IS NOT WHY.

09:18.191 --> 09:20.293
IT REFLECTS THE SUBJECT
OF THE COURSE I'M TEACHING,

09:20.327 --> 09:22.295
A SURVEY OF GAY AESTHETICS

09:22.329 --> 09:24.932
IN POST-MODERN AMERICAN ART
AND LITERATURE.

09:24.965 --> 09:27.668
- WOW, SAY THAT TEN TIMES FAST
WHILE HOLDING YOUR BREATH.

09:27.701 --> 09:30.103
- AND BECAUSE IT'S GOOD.

09:30.137 --> 09:32.105
- YOU MEAN IT?
- MM-HMM.

09:32.139 --> 09:33.874
IT MAY LOOK LIKE A COMIC BOOK,

09:33.907 --> 09:36.376
BUT IT SAYS SOMETHING
IMPORTANT ABOUT GAY PEOPLE.

09:36.409 --> 09:38.345
YOU KNOW, THE VALUE
OF FRIENDSHIP,

09:38.378 --> 09:40.981
OF LOYALTY, COURAGE.

09:41.014 --> 09:43.016
AND YOUR CHARACTERS,
THEY AREN'T JUST CARTOONS.

09:43.050 --> 09:45.653
YOU KNOW, THEY'RE REAL.
I CARE ABOUT THEM.

09:45.686 --> 09:47.888
EVEN RAGE.

09:47.921 --> 09:50.157
- WELL, THAT IS AN ACHIEVEMENT.
- UH-HUH.

09:50.190 --> 09:55.028
YOU ARE AN HONEST TO GOD
WRITER, MICHAEL.

09:55.062 --> 09:56.930
- THANK YOU.

09:56.964 --> 09:59.066
- THANK YOU, TOO.

09:59.099 --> 10:00.968
- FOR WHAT?

10:01.001 --> 10:02.402
- WELL, IF IT HADN'T
BEEN FOR YOU,

10:02.435 --> 10:05.639
I NEVER WOULD HAVE THOUGHT
SERIOUSLY ABOUT GOING TO TIBET.

10:05.673 --> 10:07.174
BUT WHEN I WAS
IN THE HOSPITAL,

10:07.207 --> 10:09.843
YOU ENCOURAGED ME TO FOCUS
ON SOMETHING POSITIVE.

10:09.877 --> 10:13.781
- YEAH, I MEANT
SEX OR CHOCOLATE CAKE.

10:13.814 --> 10:16.717
- HERE.

10:16.750 --> 10:19.419
THIS CAME TODAY.

10:19.452 --> 10:21.121
IT'S AN EMAIL
I GOT THIS MORNING

10:21.154 --> 10:23.323
FROM THE MONASTERY IN SAMYE.

10:23.356 --> 10:28.996
THEY INVITED ME
TO COME STUDY WITH THEM.

10:29.029 --> 10:31.031
BUT I-I WANT YOU TO KNOW,

10:31.064 --> 10:32.365
THERE'S NO WAY
THAT I WOULD GO

10:32.399 --> 10:34.634
WITHOUT YOUR BLESSING
AND APPROVAL.

10:44.945 --> 10:47.247
- UH, TED, HONEY?
- YEAH?

10:47.280 --> 10:49.783
- DON'T YOU NEED TO GET
TO THE WAREHOUSE?

10:49.817 --> 10:52.820
I MEAN, ISN'T THERE
A JISM JAMBOREE

10:52.853 --> 10:54.855
OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT
ON THE WEB SITE THIS AFTERNOON?

10:54.888 --> 10:58.826
- YEAH, SOMETHING LIKE THAT.

10:58.859 --> 11:02.763
YOU KNOW, I REALLY MISS
YOUR BEING THERE.

11:02.796 --> 11:06.266
- WELL, YOU'VE GOT LOTS
OF OTHER JERKERS NOW.

11:06.299 --> 11:09.169
- THEY'RE NOT YOU.

11:09.202 --> 11:12.272
MY PAL.

11:12.305 --> 11:16.309
GOOD BUDDY.

11:16.343 --> 11:20.047
LOVING FRIEND.

11:20.080 --> 11:21.815
both: HEY, GUYS.

11:21.849 --> 11:22.816
- OH.

11:22.850 --> 11:24.184
LOOK WHO IT IS.

11:24.217 --> 11:26.219
I'M SO HAPPY TO SEE YOU GUYS.

11:26.253 --> 11:29.022
- HEY, WHAT ARE YOU GALS DOING
CRUISING THE RUE DE LIBERTE?

11:29.056 --> 11:30.090
- OH, EMMETT TOLD US

11:30.123 --> 11:31.324
ABOUT THE NEW DISCO BABY
BOUTIQUE.

11:31.358 --> 11:32.359
THOUGHT WE'D COME
CHECK IT OUT.

11:32.392 --> 11:33.460
- YEAH, YEAH,

11:33.493 --> 11:34.795
WITH ALL THE GAY PARENTS
THESE DAYS,

11:34.828 --> 11:36.296
WE'VE INTRODUCED
A WHOLE NEW LINE

11:36.329 --> 11:38.331
OF, UH, BABY CLOTHES,
ACCESSORIES.

11:38.365 --> 11:40.333
- THAT'S SO CUTE.

11:40.367 --> 11:41.935
- WE'VE GOT TONS MORE.

11:41.969 --> 11:42.970

11:43.003 --> 11:44.805
I'LL SHOW YOU.

11:44.838 --> 11:46.006
TAKE HIM TO THE MOVIES,
TAKE HIM TO LUNCH,

11:46.039 --> 11:47.074
JUST TAKE HIM.

11:47.107 --> 11:49.309
- WHO?
- TEDDY.

11:49.342 --> 11:52.312
HE'S DRIVING ME CRAZY,
WON'T LEAVE ME ALONE.

11:52.345 --> 11:54.481
HE FOLLOWS ME EVERYWHERE,
HE LAUGHS AT EVERYTHING I SAY.

11:54.514 --> 11:57.350
HE KEEPS LOOKING AT ME
IN THIS WEIRD KIND OF

11:57.384 --> 11:59.186
PUPPY-DOG KIND OF WAY.

11:59.219 --> 12:02.355
- REALLY?
- YOU DON'T SAY?

12:02.389 --> 12:05.525
- AWW.

12:05.558 --> 12:09.262
SO, TEDDY,
YOU SEEING ANYONE?

12:09.296 --> 12:11.331
- ME?
NO.

12:11.364 --> 12:13.200
- MICHAEL TOLD ME
HE SAW EMMETT LAST NIGHT

12:13.233 --> 12:14.935
WITH THIS REALLY HOT GUY.

12:14.968 --> 12:16.203
- WHAT?
WHO?

12:16.236 --> 12:19.272
- WHY ARE YOU SO UPSET?
- WHO SAID I'M UPSET?

12:23.576 --> 12:25.012
IS IT THAT OBVIOUS?

12:25.045 --> 12:26.313
- 'FRAID SO, KIDDO.

12:26.346 --> 12:28.982
- WE KNEW AS SOON
AS WE SAW YOUR FACE.

12:29.016 --> 12:30.951
- I-I DON'T KNOW
HOW TO EXPLAIN IT.

12:30.984 --> 12:32.185
ONE MINUTE
I'M LOOKING AT HIM,

12:32.219 --> 12:33.420
AND HE'S THE SAME OLD EMMETT
I SEE EVERY DAY.

12:33.453 --> 12:36.957
THE NEXT MINUTE I'M LOOKING
AT HIM AND...

12:36.990 --> 12:41.461
HE'S THE MOST BEAUTIFUL THING
I'VE EVER SEEN.

12:41.494 --> 12:42.562
IT'S MASHUGANA, HUH?

12:42.595 --> 12:44.231
- AH, NOT THAT MASHUGANA.

12:44.264 --> 12:45.532
IT'S WHAT HAPPENED
TO MEL AND ME.

12:45.565 --> 12:47.000
ONE DAY, WE'RE FRIENDS,
AND--

12:47.034 --> 12:48.535
- NEXT THING YOU KNOW,
WE'RE LOVERS.

12:48.568 --> 12:49.870
- YEAH, BUT YOU'RE LESBIANS,
SO--

12:49.903 --> 12:51.404
- AH!
- OOH!

12:51.438 --> 12:53.907
FRIENDS TURN INTO LOVERS
ALL THE TIME.

12:53.941 --> 12:54.908
- EVEN FAGS.

12:54.942 --> 12:55.909
- [laughs]

12:55.943 --> 12:57.010
- SO GO FOR IT.

12:57.044 --> 12:58.545
TELL HIM HOW YOU FEEL.

12:58.578 --> 12:59.546
- YOU NEVER KNOW.

12:59.579 --> 13:02.482
YOU MIGHT JUST AWAKEN
SOME FEELINGS IN HIM.

13:06.920 --> 13:08.488
- COMMERCIALS.

13:08.521 --> 13:10.057
- YEAH, WE'RE ABOUT
TO SHOOT ONE NOW.

13:10.090 --> 13:11.524
THIS COUPLE OUT ON A DATE.

13:11.558 --> 13:14.962
CHARMING FRENCH RESTAURANT,
DINNER FOR TWO.

13:14.995 --> 13:16.897
BUT INSTEAD OF
ORDERING CHAMPAGNE,

13:16.930 --> 13:20.033
THEY ORDER STEELTOWN BEER.

13:20.067 --> 13:22.302
- SO, WHAT--WHAT DOES THIS HAVE
TO DO WITH ME?

13:22.335 --> 13:25.272
- YOU'RE THE STROLLING
VIOLINIST.

13:25.305 --> 13:27.274
YOU'RE PLAYING SOMETHING
RIDICULOUSLY ROMANTIC,

13:27.307 --> 13:31.278
LIKE PAGANINI'S CANTABILE
IN D MAJOR, OPUS 17.

13:31.311 --> 13:33.013
- YOU'RE KIDDING ME.
THAT'S ON MY CD.

13:33.046 --> 13:35.415
- NO SHIT.
IT'S ONE OF MY FAVORITES.

13:35.448 --> 13:41.421
- HUH.

13:41.454 --> 13:43.556
- I SHOULD GIVE YOU MY CARD.

13:43.590 --> 13:45.893
MY NAME'S BRIAN.

13:45.926 --> 13:48.461
BRIAN KINNEY.

13:48.495 --> 13:53.600
AND YOU ARE?

13:53.633 --> 13:55.435
- ETHAN. GOLD.

13:55.468 --> 13:57.070
- BRIAN.

13:57.104 --> 13:58.238
BRIAN, I THOUGHT
YOU'D BE AT WORK.

13:58.271 --> 14:00.140
- WE'RE JUST HAVING
A BUSINESS MEETING.

14:00.173 --> 14:03.176
JUSTIN, THIS IS ETHAN.
ETHAN, JUSTIN.

14:13.987 --> 14:16.323
- I GOTTA GET TO CLASS.

14:19.993 --> 14:21.428
- BY THE WAY,
IF YOU'RE INTERESTED,

14:21.461 --> 14:22.395
THE JOB'S YOURS.

14:32.205 --> 14:34.207
- [sighs]

14:34.241 --> 14:37.644
- $15 FOR THE HOUSE SALAD?

14:37.677 --> 14:39.646
HOPE THEY THROW IN A POOL
AND A TENNIS COURT.

14:39.679 --> 14:41.414
- [laughs]

14:41.448 --> 14:44.918
DON'T LOOK AT THE PRICES,
JUST ORDER WHATEVER YOU WANT.

14:44.952 --> 14:48.455
- I'LL HAVE HIM, TO GO.

14:48.488 --> 14:50.390
- JUST--JUST YOUR TYPE?

14:50.423 --> 14:52.259
- ISN'T HE YOURS?

14:52.292 --> 14:53.393
- NOT REALLY.

15:01.668 --> 15:04.271
- YOU DRINK ANY MORE WATER,
YOU'LL DROWN.

15:04.304 --> 15:07.274
- I'M THIRSTY.

15:07.307 --> 15:11.244
- YOU KNOW, TEDDY, YOU'VE BEEN
ACTING REALLY WEIRD LATELY.

15:11.278 --> 15:12.412
- WEIRD, WHAT DO YOU MEAN,
WEIRD?

15:12.445 --> 15:14.381
- WELL, I-IT'S SORT OF LIKE,

15:14.414 --> 15:16.216
YOU HAVE SOMETHING
YOU WANT TO SAY,

15:16.249 --> 15:18.251
BUT YOU'RE NOT TELLING ME.

15:18.285 --> 15:19.652
- WOULD YOU LIKE ME TO?

15:19.686 --> 15:22.255
- DON'T WE SHARE EVERYTHING?

15:22.289 --> 15:23.256
- NOT YET.

15:29.462 --> 15:31.131
EMMETT, I--

15:37.004 --> 15:39.672
[clears throat]
THANKS.

15:39.706 --> 15:41.308
[clears throat]

15:46.179 --> 15:47.514
BOY, AM I THIRSTY.

15:54.021 --> 15:54.954
[coughs]

16:00.693 --> 16:02.729
AS YOU KNOW, I--

16:02.762 --> 16:06.166
NEVER BEEN VERY LUCKY
IN THE LOVE DEPARTMENT.

16:06.199 --> 16:08.168
- I KNOW.
- YEAH.

16:08.201 --> 16:11.038
ALWAYS CHASING
AFTER THE WRONG BOY.

16:11.071 --> 16:13.340
ONE REJECTION
AFTER ANOTHER.

16:13.373 --> 16:15.242
- POOR BABY.

16:15.275 --> 16:17.710
- I'D PRACTICALLY GIVEN UP HOPE
OF EVER FINDING HIM.

16:17.744 --> 16:22.182
YOU KNOW, SAID "FUCK YOU"
TO LOVE.

16:22.215 --> 16:25.452
THEN, THE OTHER NIGHT...

16:27.254 --> 16:30.057
[sighs]

16:30.090 --> 16:31.158
THERE HE WAS.

16:31.191 --> 16:33.226
- OH, TEDDY.

16:33.260 --> 16:35.095
- YEAH, IT WAS
JUST LIKE YOU SAID.

16:35.128 --> 16:37.497
YOU KNOW, LOVE COMES
WHEN YOU LEAST EXPECT IT.

16:37.530 --> 16:40.733
- HMM.

16:40.767 --> 16:42.235
SO THAT'S WHY YOU'VE BEEN

16:42.269 --> 16:48.241
SO STARRY-EYED AND VAGUELY
DISCONTENTED LATELY.

16:48.275 --> 16:51.378
WELL, DON'T JUST SIT THERE
STARING AT YOUR PATE.

16:51.411 --> 16:52.645
TELL ME.

16:52.679 --> 16:53.646
WHO IS IT?

16:53.680 --> 16:55.115
WHO?

16:55.148 --> 16:58.551
- YOU.

16:58.585 --> 17:01.154
- "YOU" WHO?

17:01.188 --> 17:03.256
- YOU YOU.

17:03.290 --> 17:04.691
- ME YOU?

17:04.724 --> 17:08.528
- YES, YOU YOU.

17:08.561 --> 17:10.563
YOU'RE THE ONE

17:10.597 --> 17:12.599
WHO KNOWS ME BETTER
THAN ANYONE,

17:12.632 --> 17:15.502
AND STILL HASN'T RUN AWAY...

17:15.535 --> 17:20.273
WHO TELLS ME I'M ADORABLE
WHEN I LOOK LIKE SHIT...

17:20.307 --> 17:24.144
WHO, WITH
HIS LITTLE FINGER,

17:24.177 --> 17:27.347
CAN LIFT MY SPIRITS
EVEN WHEN THEY WEIGH 300 POUNDS.

17:31.451 --> 17:33.386
I LOVE YOU,
EMMETT HONEYCUTT.

17:33.420 --> 17:34.821
I--

17:52.605 --> 17:53.540
- BRIAN?

18:01.514 --> 18:03.183
I'M SORRY.

18:03.216 --> 18:05.585
- WHAT FOR?
- YOU KNOW WHAT FOR.

18:05.618 --> 18:07.287
I DIDN'T MEAN FOR IT
TO HAPPEN.

18:07.320 --> 18:08.855
- I KNOW.

18:08.888 --> 18:12.625
YOU'RE THE POOR, HAPLESS VICTIM
OF A LOVE BASHING.

18:12.659 --> 18:14.161
- I SHOULD'VE TOLD YOU
ABOUT IT.

18:14.194 --> 18:18.465
- AND TAKEN ALL THE FUN
OUT OF IT?

18:18.498 --> 18:20.300
SO, HOW BIG'S HIS DICK?

18:20.333 --> 18:21.401
- THAT HAS NOTHING
TO DO WITH IT.

18:21.434 --> 18:23.770
- SINCE WHEN?

18:26.573 --> 18:29.108
YOU LOVE COCK.

18:31.944 --> 18:34.547
YOU LOVE IT DOWN YOUR THROAT,

18:34.581 --> 18:36.449
YOU LOVE IT UP YOUR ASS,

18:36.483 --> 18:39.352
YOU LOVE RIDING IT.

18:39.386 --> 18:41.388
AND AFTER YOU COME,

18:41.421 --> 18:43.556
YOU LOVE TO FALL ASLEEP

18:43.590 --> 18:46.393
WITH IT STILL INSIDE YOU.

18:46.426 --> 18:48.461
- CUT IT OUT.

18:48.495 --> 18:50.230
CUT IT OUT.

18:50.263 --> 18:54.601
- YOU'RE HARD, SO DON'T TELL ME
IT DOESN'T MATTER.

18:54.634 --> 18:56.803
- THERE ARE OTHER THINGS.

18:56.836 --> 19:00.640
- FLOWERS?
PICNICS?

19:00.673 --> 19:02.742
VIOLIN MUSIC?

19:02.775 --> 19:06.513
- HE LOVES ME.

19:06.546 --> 19:10.250
- YOUR DREAMY-EYED SCHOOLBOY.

19:10.283 --> 19:11.884
- IN WAYS THAT YOU CAN'T.

19:11.918 --> 19:15.355
- IN WAYS THAT I WON'T.

19:15.388 --> 19:17.324
- HE TOLD ME
THAT I'M ALL HE WANTS.

19:17.357 --> 19:19.192
- THEY'RE STILL USING THAT ONE?

19:19.226 --> 19:20.560
- IT'S MORE
THAN YOU'VE EVER SAID.

19:27.734 --> 19:29.302
- AND IT'S MORE
THAN I EVER WILL.

19:29.336 --> 19:32.939
SO, UH,

19:32.972 --> 19:38.311
WHAT THE FUCK ARE YOU
STILL DOING HERE?

19:38.345 --> 19:39.679
- WOULD YOU CARE IF I WASN'T?

19:46.719 --> 19:50.457
- IT'S YOUR CALL,
WHERE YOU WANT TO BE.

19:50.490 --> 19:51.858
YOU DECIDE.

20:00.533 --> 20:02.302
- BABYLON, 9:00.

20:02.335 --> 20:03.703
OKAY, GUYS?

20:03.736 --> 20:05.505
FRIDAY NIGHT, 9:00.
RAGE AT BABYLON.

20:05.538 --> 20:06.706
- COOL.
THANK YOU.

20:06.739 --> 20:07.740
- HI, GUYS.
HERE.

20:07.774 --> 20:10.377
9:00.
BE THERE, OKAY?

20:10.410 --> 20:11.844
BABYLON,
RAGE.

20:11.878 --> 20:13.913
- YOU SHOULD BE
HIS AGENT.

20:13.946 --> 20:15.648
- WHO NEEDS AN AGENT
WHEN YOU GOT A MOTHER?

20:15.682 --> 20:19.586
[laughs]

20:19.619 --> 20:20.687
UH-OH.

20:20.720 --> 20:23.256
WHAT'S WITH THAT LONG FACE?

20:23.290 --> 20:25.525
- BEN'S SERIOUS
ABOUT GOING TO TIBET.

20:25.558 --> 20:28.261
- AND HE'S OUT
OF HIS FUCKING MIND.

20:28.295 --> 20:29.696
- IT MUST BE COSMIC DESTINY.

20:29.729 --> 20:32.932
EVERY TIME I FALL IN LOVE
WITH SOMEONE, HE LEAVES TOWN.

20:32.965 --> 20:34.601
THIS ONE'S EVEN
LEAVING THE COUNTRY.

20:34.634 --> 20:35.902
- WELL, HE CAN'T GO.

20:35.935 --> 20:36.903
- WHY NOT?

20:36.936 --> 20:37.937
- WELL, FOR ONE THING,

20:37.970 --> 20:39.872
NOBODY EVEN KNOWS
WHERE IN THE FUCK TIBET IS.

20:39.906 --> 20:41.808
AND FOR ANOTHER THING,
I-IT'S DANGEROUS.

20:41.841 --> 20:43.376
WHAT IF SOMETHING SHOULD
HAPPEN?

20:43.410 --> 20:44.477
I MEAN, WHAT IF,

20:44.511 --> 20:46.579
GOD FORBID, HE GOT SICK,

20:46.613 --> 20:48.548
AND THE NEAREST HOSPITAL'S
HUNDREDS,

20:48.581 --> 20:50.417
THOUSANDS OF MILES AWAY?

20:50.450 --> 20:52.051
- JESUS, WOULD YOU STOP
SCARING ME?

20:52.084 --> 20:53.886
- WELL, I'M SCARING MYSELF.

20:53.920 --> 20:56.656
SOMEBODY SHOULD TALK SOME SENSE
INTO THAT BOY.

20:56.689 --> 20:58.725
- YOU ASK ME, HE'S MAKING
PERFECT SENSE.

20:58.758 --> 21:00.793
REMEMBER CHRISTMAS EVE,
THREE YEARS AGO?

21:00.827 --> 21:02.762
I WAS LYING THERE
IN THAT HOSPITAL BED,

21:02.795 --> 21:04.931
ATTACHED TO EVERY GODDAMN
TUBE KNOWN TO MAN.

21:04.964 --> 21:05.932
THEY WERE SURE
I WASN'T EVEN GOING

21:05.965 --> 21:07.367
TO MAKE IT
TO NEW YEAR'S.

21:07.400 --> 21:08.368
- BUT YOU SURPRISED THEM.

21:08.401 --> 21:09.436
- AND AS SOON
AS I GOT OUT,

21:09.469 --> 21:10.737
I BOUGHT TWO TICKETS
TO ITALY.

21:10.770 --> 21:12.505
- ONE FOR YOU
AND ONE FOR ME.

21:12.539 --> 21:14.374
- I WAS GOING TO GET TO CAPRI,

21:14.407 --> 21:16.343
EVEN IF THEY HAD TO
SHIP ME HOME FEDERAL EXPRESS.

21:16.376 --> 21:18.545
MAYBE BEN FEELS THE SAME WAY.

21:18.578 --> 21:20.780
- BEN'S NOT DYING.
- NO.

21:20.813 --> 21:23.383
BUT THE ONE THING THIS FUCKING
DISEASE TEACHES YOU IS

21:23.416 --> 21:25.852
THERE ISN'T AN INFINITE AMOUNT
OF TOMORROWS.

21:25.885 --> 21:26.919
SO DO IT NOW.

21:26.953 --> 21:30.690
BEFORE IT'S TOO LATE.

21:32.625 --> 21:34.327
- YOUR BOYFRIEND'S AN ASSHOLE.

21:34.361 --> 21:35.862
- HE'S NOT AN ASSHOLE.

21:35.895 --> 21:37.764
HE'S--HE'S HONEST.

21:37.797 --> 21:40.400
IF ANYONE'S AN ASSHOLE,
I AM, FOR LYING.

21:40.433 --> 21:42.402
- HOW DID HE FIND OUT?
- I DON'T KNOW.

21:42.435 --> 21:45.638
- YOU DIDN'T ASK HIM?
- HE'D NEVER TELL ME.

21:45.672 --> 21:47.974
- WELL YOU CAN TELL HIM,
FROM ME,

21:48.007 --> 21:53.079
THAT HE CAN KEEP HIS FUCKING
DONATION TO THE ARTS.

21:53.112 --> 21:54.381
- WAIT, HE CAN AFFORD
TO GIVE IT AWAY.

21:54.414 --> 21:56.649
YOU CAN'T.

21:56.683 --> 21:59.852
- AT LEAST NOW I KNOW
WHY YOU'RE WITH HIM.

21:59.886 --> 22:03.055
GOD, HE'S BEAUTIFUL.

22:03.089 --> 22:04.557
MUST BE GREAT IN BED.

22:04.591 --> 22:07.694
- YEAH, HE IS.

22:07.727 --> 22:10.597
BUT IT--IT'S WHEN WE'RE
NOT IN BED THAT'S THE PROBLEM.

22:10.630 --> 22:13.800
- WELL, GUESS WHAT?

22:13.833 --> 22:15.968
I'M NOT THE ANSWER.

22:16.002 --> 22:18.004
I HAVE MYSELF TO THINK ABOUT.

22:18.037 --> 22:19.839
THE HEIFETZ COMPETITION IS
COMING UP.

22:19.872 --> 22:23.042
$25,000 FIRST PRIZE,
TOURING DATES,

22:23.075 --> 22:25.044
POSSIBLE RECORDING
CONTRACT.

22:25.077 --> 22:27.580
I CAN'T BE WASTING MY TIME
THINKING ABOUT YOU,

22:27.614 --> 22:29.616
WISHING THAT YOU WERE HERE,

22:29.649 --> 22:30.850
HOPING THAT TONIGHT
IS GOING TO BE THE NIGHT

22:30.883 --> 22:32.519
THAT YOU FINALLY STAY.

22:32.552 --> 22:33.853
- I WANT TO STAY.

22:33.886 --> 22:36.956
- WELL, YOU CAN'T.

22:36.989 --> 22:39.158
YOU CAN'T.

22:39.191 --> 22:42.695
SO JUST GO BACK
TO YOUR BOYFRIEND,

22:42.729 --> 22:45.432
AND I'LL GO BACK
TO MY VIOLIN.

22:45.465 --> 22:48.134
[aggressively playing violin]

22:48.167 --> 22:50.603
- ETHAN.
ETHAN.

22:50.637 --> 22:51.638
ETHAN.

23:10.590 --> 23:14.427
- [sighs]

23:14.461 --> 23:15.928
- HE SAID HE LOVES YOU?

23:15.962 --> 23:18.164
- MM-HMM.

23:18.197 --> 23:19.599
AND THAT WE SHOULD
SERIOUSLY CONSIDER

23:19.632 --> 23:21.668
BEING MORE
THAN JUST FRIENDS.

23:21.701 --> 23:22.769
PASS THE CHIPS.

23:22.802 --> 23:26.939
THAT WE SHOULD BE LOVERS.

23:26.973 --> 23:28.441
- I THOUGHT YOU ATE.

23:28.475 --> 23:31.177
- WHO COULD EAT AFTER THAT?

23:31.210 --> 23:32.178
- SO WHAT DID YOU SAY?

23:32.211 --> 23:34.481
- "EXCUSE ME, I HAVE TO GO
TO THE BATHROOM."

23:34.514 --> 23:35.782
- SURE.

23:35.815 --> 23:37.817
- NO, I MEAN TO HIM.

23:37.850 --> 23:41.488
I WAS DRINKING
A LOT OF WATER.

23:41.521 --> 23:45.692
JESUS.
WHAT AM I GOING TO DO?

23:45.725 --> 23:48.528
- WELL, FIRST,
YOU NEED TO ASK YOURSELF

23:48.561 --> 23:51.097
IF YOU HAVE ANY FEELINGS
FOR HIM.

23:51.130 --> 23:54.200
- WELL, SURE, I HAVE
FEELINGS FOR HIM.

23:54.233 --> 23:55.735
YOU KNOW, WARM FEELINGS,

23:55.768 --> 23:58.004
FUZZY FEELINGS,

23:58.037 --> 23:59.138
LIKE I HAVE FOR YOU,

23:59.171 --> 24:00.640
A-AND MEL AND LINDS.

24:00.673 --> 24:03.943
EVEN BRIAN,
SOMETIMES.

24:03.976 --> 24:06.479
BUT NOT THOSE KIND
OF FEELINGS.

24:06.513 --> 24:07.279
- WELL, THEN
YOU'RE JUST GOING TO HAVE

24:07.313 --> 24:08.981
TO BITE THE BULLET
AND TELL HIM.

24:09.015 --> 24:12.018
[door opening and closing]

24:12.051 --> 24:13.119
- HELLO.

24:13.152 --> 24:14.887
- HEY.
- OH.

24:14.921 --> 24:16.022
HEY, DO YOU MIND
IF I MAKE ONE OF THOSE?

24:16.055 --> 24:17.524
I DIDN'T GET ANY DINNER.

24:17.557 --> 24:19.592
- IT'S IMPORTANT THAT YOU EAT.
- YEAH.

24:19.626 --> 24:21.494
OH, UH, I WAS TALKING
TO MY NEIGHBOR,

24:21.528 --> 24:23.062
AND SHE SAID SHE KNOWS
A VISITING PROFESSOR

24:23.095 --> 24:26.966
WHO MIGHT WANT
TO SUBLET MY PLACE.

24:26.999 --> 24:27.934
- GREAT.

24:34.607 --> 24:36.108
- HONEY,

24:36.142 --> 24:38.277
IF YOU DON'T WANT HIM
TO GO,

24:38.310 --> 24:40.813
YOU'RE JUST GOING TO HAVE
TO BITE THE BULLET

24:40.847 --> 24:43.783
AND TELL HIM.

26:42.769 --> 26:44.871
- AHH.

26:44.904 --> 26:48.040
- BEN?

26:48.074 --> 26:50.843
- WHAT IS IT, BABY?

26:50.877 --> 26:52.812
- TIBET'S AWFULLY FAR AWAY.

26:52.845 --> 26:54.180
WHAT IF SOMETHING HAPPENS?

26:54.213 --> 26:57.383
ARE THERE DOCTORS?
ARE THERE HOSPITALS?

26:57.416 --> 26:59.051
- YEAH, YEAH.

26:59.085 --> 27:00.252
I--

27:00.286 --> 27:03.122
I'VE BEEN CHECKING IT OUT,

27:03.155 --> 27:05.124
AND YOU WOULD BE AMAZED,
IN THE PAST FEW YEARS,

27:05.157 --> 27:06.759
HOW MODERNIZED IT'S BECOME.

27:06.793 --> 27:08.127
- YEAH, BUT WHAT IF
IT'S AN EMERGENCY?

27:08.160 --> 27:11.731
YOU KNOW, LIKE LAST TIME.

27:11.764 --> 27:13.199
- WELL, I'M NOT GOING
TO LIVE MY LIFE IN FEAR.

27:13.232 --> 27:16.135
- IT'S NOT FEAR, IT'S--
IT'S BEING PRACTICAL.

27:16.168 --> 27:21.874
SIX MONTHS IS A LONG TIME.

27:21.908 --> 27:26.946
- SO YOU'RE TELLING ME
YOU DON'T WANT ME TO GO?

27:26.979 --> 27:30.349
- LOOK, I KNOW HOW IMPORTANT
THIS TRIP IS TO YOU, BUT--

27:30.382 --> 27:32.852
- NO.
NO.

27:32.885 --> 27:35.321
YOU DON'T NEED TO EXPLAIN.

27:35.354 --> 27:37.990
I TOLD YOU THAT
I WOULDN'T GO

27:38.024 --> 27:40.793
UNLESS YOU WERE OKAY WITH IT,
AND I MEANT THAT.

27:52.939 --> 27:55.908
- NO.

27:58.945 --> 28:00.913
NO, THIS IS NOT
ABOUT WHAT I WANT.

28:00.947 --> 28:06.719
THIS IS ABOUT WHAT YOU NEED.

28:06.753 --> 28:11.290
SO GO...

28:11.323 --> 28:14.827
WITH MY BLESSING AND APPROVAL.

28:26.105 --> 28:26.939
[I Puritani's A Te, O Cara

IT'S AMAZING HOW MUCH
THEY THRIVE TO BEL CANTO.

29:10.482 --> 29:12.351
- WELL, I-I-I HAD
TO TALK TO YOU.

29:12.384 --> 29:13.352
I COULDN'T REALLY WAIT, SO--

29:13.385 --> 29:14.420
- OH, COME IN,

29:14.453 --> 29:15.988
UH, CAN I GET YOU
SOME BREAKFAST?

- OH, NO, PLEASE.

29:21.127 --> 29:24.063
UH, BE MY GUEST.

29:26.999 --> 29:29.936
- [clears throat]

29:33.005 --> 29:35.975
I WAS UP ALL NIGHT, UH,
THINKING ABOUT WHAT YOU SAID.

29:36.008 --> 29:37.844
- BEFORE YOU SAY ANYTHING,
JUST LET ME SAY,

29:37.877 --> 29:39.879
I KNOW, IT MUST'VE COME
AS A COMPLETE SHOCK.

29:39.912 --> 29:42.381
BUT IT MAKES SO MUCH SENSE.
WE HAVE SO MUCH IN COMMON.

29:42.414 --> 29:44.917
WE HATE THE SAME MOVIES,
LAUGH AT THE SAME PEOPLE.

29:44.951 --> 29:47.153
WE HAVE A REAL SIMPATICO,
YOU KNOW?

29:47.186 --> 29:51.257
AND IT SEEMED ONLY NATURAL
TO TAKE THE NEXT STEP.

29:51.290 --> 29:53.893
[clears throat]

29:53.926 --> 29:55.361
OKAY, NOW YOU.

30:02.234 --> 30:07.439
- TEDDY, I, UH,
AM TRULY TOUCHED--

30:07.473 --> 30:10.309
UH, YOU MIGHT
EVEN SAY OVERWHELMED--

30:10.342 --> 30:14.180
BY, UH, BY YOUR FEELINGS.

30:14.213 --> 30:18.150
AND, UH, SO, SO FLATTERED.

30:20.619 --> 30:26.325
BUT YOU SEE, I--

30:26.358 --> 30:27.593
GOD, I DON'T KNOW
HOW TO SAY THIS.

30:27.626 --> 30:29.195
UM--

30:35.301 --> 30:37.169
- IT'S OKAY.
YOU DON'T HAVE TO.

30:37.203 --> 30:39.471
I KNOW--I KNOW
WHAT YOU'RE TRYING TO SAY.

30:39.505 --> 30:42.074
YOU LOVE ME TO DEATH,
BUT YOU DON'T LOVE ME.

30:42.108 --> 30:44.877
SO WE SHOULD KEEP THINGS
AS THEY ARE.

30:44.911 --> 30:46.145
JUST STAY FRIENDS, RIGHT?

30:51.350 --> 30:53.185
HEY, SEE, WE HAVE
SO MUCH IN COMMON,

30:53.219 --> 30:54.486
WE CAN EVEN READ
EACH OTHER'S MINDS.

30:57.123 --> 31:00.226
WELL.

31:00.259 --> 31:01.460
IT WAS JUST A THOUGHT.

31:01.493 --> 31:03.229
YOU KNOW, A SUGGESTION.

31:03.262 --> 31:05.497
THAT'S ALL.

31:05.531 --> 31:06.665
WOULD YOU EXCUSE ME?

31:06.698 --> 31:08.367
I'VE GOT TO, UH--
I'VE GOT TO GET DRESSED,

31:08.400 --> 31:09.501
OR I'M GOING TO BE
LATE FOR WORK.

PITTSBURGH OUT.

31:37.329 --> 31:38.597
COULDN'T YOU HAVE
DRESSED UP A LITTLE?

31:38.630 --> 31:41.533
- I'M AN ARTIST,
NOT A BUSINESSMAN.

31:41.567 --> 31:43.102
I DON'T NEED
TO WEAR A SUIT AND TIE

31:43.135 --> 31:44.370
TO IMPRESS ANYONE.

31:44.403 --> 31:45.271
- THIS IS FOR BRIAN.

31:45.304 --> 31:46.939
HE--HE WENT TO A LOT
OF TROUBLE FOR US.

31:46.973 --> 31:50.009
- IT'S NOT FOR US,
IT'S FOR HIM.

31:50.042 --> 31:52.011
BRIAN CALLS ALL THE SHOTS.

31:52.044 --> 31:54.413
BRIAN CONTROLS THE SHOW,
INCLUDING US.

31:54.446 --> 31:56.415
- IF YOU ASK ME,
HE'S BEEN PRETTY GOOD TO YOU.

31:56.448 --> 31:58.150
I MEAN, HE SAVED YOUR LIFE,

31:58.184 --> 32:00.252
TOOK YOU IN, HE'S PUTTING YOU
THROUGH SCHOOL,

32:00.286 --> 32:02.388
HE PROTECTS YOU,
LOOKS AFTER YOU, YOU KNOW,

32:02.421 --> 32:04.256
AND WHETHER YOU BELIEVE IT
OR NOT, HE LOVES YOU,

32:04.290 --> 32:05.958
MORE THAN HE'S
EVER LOVED ANYONE.

32:05.992 --> 32:07.493
- HE DOESN'T LOVE ME.

32:07.526 --> 32:09.028
HE FUCKS ME.

32:09.061 --> 32:11.697
- WELL, THEN, WHY DON'T YOU
FIND SOMEBODY ELSE?

32:11.730 --> 32:17.369
MAYBE YOU ALREADY HAVE.

32:17.403 --> 32:18.604
- HE TOLD YOU?

32:18.637 --> 32:22.141
- HE NEVER SAID A WORD.

32:22.174 --> 32:27.046
I TOLD HIM.

32:27.079 --> 32:28.547
- HOW DID YOU KNOW?

32:28.580 --> 32:31.317
- I SAW THE TWO OF YOU
KISSING ON THE STREET.

32:31.350 --> 32:32.318
- YOU ASSHOLE.

32:32.351 --> 32:33.352
- DON'T CALL ME
AN ASSHOLE,

32:33.385 --> 32:35.054
YOU UNGRATEFUL LITTLE PRICK.

32:35.087 --> 32:36.522
- AND WHY DON'T YOU MIND
YOUR OWN BUSINESS?

32:36.555 --> 32:38.324
- BRIAN IS MY BUSINESS.
HE'S MY BEST FRIEND.

- I KNOW ABOUT THAT STUFF.

33:11.757 --> 33:13.525
HELPS EXTEND YOUR ORGASMS.

33:13.559 --> 33:15.461

IN CASE YOU GET HUNGRY LATER.

33:41.420 --> 33:46.058
- THANK YOU.

33:46.092 --> 33:48.127
- I GOTTA TAKE CARE
OF MY BOYS.

33:48.160 --> 33:49.528
YOU'RE NOT GONNA GET
THESE KIND OF HOMEMADE TREATS

33:49.561 --> 33:50.662
WHERE YOU'RE GOING.

33:50.696 --> 33:54.400
- NO.
NO, I WILL--I'LL MISS THEM.

33:54.433 --> 33:59.405

A LOT OF THINGS.

33:59.438 --> 34:02.241
BEN, SIX MONTHS IS
A LONG TIME

34:02.274 --> 34:03.242
TO ASK SOMEBODY
TO WAIT.

34:03.275 --> 34:06.345
I MEAN, YOU NEVER KNOW
WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN.

34:09.315 --> 34:12.584
- WE TALKED ABOUT IT,
AND, UH,

34:12.618 --> 34:14.453
HE'LL BE FINE.

34:14.486 --> 34:16.422
YOU KNOW, IN FACT,
IN SOME WAYS,

34:16.455 --> 34:18.324
HE MIGHT EVEN
BE BETTER OFF.

34:18.357 --> 34:19.825
- HOW DO YOU FIGURE THAT?

34:19.858 --> 34:21.560
- WELL, YOU KNOW,

34:21.593 --> 34:23.795
NOT HAVING ME AROUND
TO WORRY ABOUT.

34:23.829 --> 34:25.731
- UH-HUH.

34:25.764 --> 34:27.433
SO YOU'RE DOING HIM A FAVOR.

34:27.466 --> 34:28.767
WHAT THE FUCK IS THAT?

34:28.800 --> 34:31.603
SOME KIND OF NOBLE
SELF-SACRIFICE?

- LOOK, DEBBIE, YOU KNOW
BETTER THAN ANYONE,

34:35.341 --> 34:37.643
HE--HE WOULD HAVE
AN EASIER RIDE.

34:37.676 --> 34:40.512
- WHO SAYS LOVE'S AN EASY RIDE?
GENERAL MOTORS?

34:40.546 --> 34:42.648
MICHAEL'S USED TO BUMPS.

34:42.681 --> 34:45.184
HE GREW UP WITH ME.

34:45.217 --> 34:47.386
SO, IF YOU THINK
YOU'RE DOING HIM A FAVOR

34:47.419 --> 34:50.189
BY LEAVING,
THERE'S NO NEED.

34:50.222 --> 34:52.124
MY SON'S STRONG.

34:52.158 --> 34:54.893
HE'S STRONG ENOUGH
TO SEE ANYTHING THROUGH.

34:54.926 --> 34:57.196
THE QUESTION IS, ARE YOU?

35:07.239 --> 35:10.209
[dance music playing]

35:10.242 --> 35:18.217
*

35:38.804 --> 35:40.939

35:40.972 --> 35:43.275
AND A ZEPHYR-POLITAN FOR ME.

35:43.309 --> 35:44.676
- ALL RIGHT.

35:44.710 --> 35:46.845
- ISN'T THAT ADORABLE?
- LEAVE IT TO BRIAN.

35:46.878 --> 35:48.347
GOTTA HAND IT TO HIM.

35:48.380 --> 35:49.748
WHEN IT COMES
TO THROWING PARTIES,

35:49.781 --> 35:51.383
HE'S ALMOST IN
THE SAME LEAGUE AS ME.

35:51.417 --> 35:52.851
[laughter]

35:52.884 --> 35:55.454
WELL, AREN'T YOU GOING TO MAKE
SOME CLEVER BON MOT

35:55.487 --> 35:57.789
ABOUT MY PARTIES?

35:57.823 --> 36:02.428
- I'LL GET A RAGE-TINI.

36:02.461 --> 36:04.630
- THIS IS SO COOL.

36:04.663 --> 36:06.232
YOU'RE A STAR.

36:06.265 --> 36:07.499
- RIGHT.

36:07.533 --> 36:09.201
- DAMN RIGHT IT'S RIGHT.

36:09.235 --> 36:12.371
ARE OUR KIDS FUCKING
UNBELIEVABLE OR WHAT?

36:12.404 --> 36:15.207
- THEY ABSO-FUCKING-LUTELY
ARE.

36:15.241 --> 36:16.208
[laughs]

36:16.242 --> 36:17.343
BUT I'M NOT SURPRISED.

36:17.376 --> 36:19.445
IT'S LIKE WHEN YOU LEARNED TO
RIDE YOUR TWO-WHEELER.

36:19.478 --> 36:20.679
IF YOU WANT SOMETHING,

36:20.712 --> 36:22.848
NOTHING CAN STOP YOU.

36:22.881 --> 36:24.283
YOU.

36:24.316 --> 36:25.284
- WOW.

36:25.317 --> 36:26.952
[siren wailing]

36:26.985 --> 36:30.222
[cheers and applause]

36:36.595 --> 36:38.830
- WELCOME TO GAYOPOLIS,

36:38.864 --> 36:42.834
HOME OF THAT FABULOUS
SUPERHERO, RAGE.

36:42.868 --> 36:45.404
WHAT, YOU'VE NEVER HEARD
OF RAGE?

36:45.437 --> 36:47.573
WELL, YOU WILL AFTER TONIGHT.

36:47.606 --> 36:50.442
WITH POWERS OF MIND GREATER
THAN ANY KNOWN TO MAN,

36:50.476 --> 36:53.379
HE CAN BEND ANYONE'S WILL
TO HIS,

36:53.412 --> 36:56.282
ROUT THE FORCES OF
INTOLERANCE AND INJUSTICE,

36:56.315 --> 37:00.852
AND STILL HAVE THE STRENGTH
TO FUCK 100 GUYS.

37:00.886 --> 37:05.324
[cheers and applause]

37:05.357 --> 37:06.725
- I WROTE THAT COPY.

37:06.758 --> 37:08.327
- NO SHIT.

37:08.360 --> 37:09.961
- UH-OH, LOOKS LIKE
A TWINK'S IN TROUBLE.

37:09.995 --> 37:12.931
- COME HERE, YOU QUEER.
- COCKSUCKER.

37:12.964 --> 37:15.401
[dramatic music playing]

37:15.434 --> 37:16.635
- [shouts]

37:16.668 --> 37:19.705
- COME HERE, HOMO.
- [grunts]

37:19.738 --> 37:24.009
[actors taunting]

37:29.515 --> 37:31.483
SOMEBODY HELP ME!

37:31.517 --> 37:35.787
- BUT SOMEWHERE IN GAYOPOLIS,
HIS CRIES ARE HEARD.

37:38.023 --> 37:40.959
IT'S RAGE AND ZEPHYR!

37:40.992 --> 37:42.260
[cheering]

38:03.982 --> 38:08.520
RAGE ENTRAPS J.T.'S BASHERS
IN A MIND DISTORTION FIELD.

38:08.554 --> 38:11.022
THEY PERCEIVE EACH OTHER
AS FAGS,

38:11.056 --> 38:14.793
AND BEAT THEMSELVES
TO DEATH!

38:14.826 --> 38:17.563
[cheering]

38:21.733 --> 38:24.102
[thunder booming]

38:24.135 --> 38:25.937
RAGE REVIVES J.T.

38:25.971 --> 38:30.308
USING HIS OTHER SUPERPOWER.

38:31.977 --> 38:33.912
[cheers and applause]

38:44.390 --> 38:47.893
AND JUSTICE PREVAILS
IN GAYOPOLIS.

38:47.926 --> 38:50.829
EVERYBODY, PARTY!

38:50.862 --> 38:53.832
[dance music playing]

38:53.865 --> 39:01.607
*

39:03.742 --> 39:07.112
- WELL, DON'T THANK ME
ALL AT ONCE.

39:07.145 --> 39:12.884
- I THINK I'M GOING
TO GET A DRINK.

39:12.918 --> 39:15.554
- WHAT'S HIS PROBLEM?

39:15.587 --> 39:17.856
- WE'RE NOT SPEAKING.

39:17.889 --> 39:20.626
- CREATIVE DIFFERENCES.

39:20.659 --> 39:22.628
- ACTUALLY, WE'RE
IN TOTAL AGREEMENT.

39:22.661 --> 39:25.997
HE THINKS I'M AN ASSHOLE,
AND I THINK HE'S ONE.

39:26.031 --> 39:28.667
- WELL, I JUST SPENT
A FUCKING FORTUNE ON THIS,

39:28.700 --> 39:30.135
SO, UH, SORT IT OUT.

39:30.168 --> 39:31.737
- AFTER WHAT HE TOLD YOU?

39:31.770 --> 39:34.005
- HE WAS JUST
LOOKING AFTER ME.

39:34.039 --> 39:38.444
LIKE ZEPHYR
LOOKS AFTER RAGE.

39:38.477 --> 39:40.846
YOU KNOW, IF YOU WANT
YOUR COMIC BOOK TO BE A SUCCESS,

39:40.879 --> 39:44.916
YOU SHOULD PUT
YOUR PERSONAL FEELINGS ASIDE,

39:44.950 --> 39:47.786
AND DON'T PISS
ON YOUR ACHIEVEMENT.

40:01.933 --> 40:04.870
- I THINK I'LL HAVE ONE OF
THOSE, UH, PRETTY PURPLE ONES.

40:08.206 --> 40:09.007
- THERE'S MICHAEL.

40:09.040 --> 40:10.509
I SHOULD GO,
UH, CONGRATULATE HIM.

40:10.542 --> 40:11.477
- HEY.

40:11.510 --> 40:14.045
WOULD YOU STOP RUNNING AWAY
FROM ME, PLEASE?

40:14.079 --> 40:15.914
- WHO'S RUNNING?
- YOU ARE.

40:15.947 --> 40:18.083
AND DON'T TELL ME
YOU'RE NOT.

40:18.116 --> 40:22.053
WE CAN READ EACH OTHER'S MINDS,
REMEMBER?

40:22.087 --> 40:24.556
YOU'RE EMBARRASSED.

40:24.590 --> 40:26.191
- VERY PERCEPTIVE.

40:26.224 --> 40:29.060
- WELL, THERE'S NOTHING
TO BE EMBARRASSED ABOUT.

40:29.094 --> 40:30.195
- IT'S EASY FOR YOU TO SAY.

40:30.228 --> 40:32.130
YOU DIDN'T MAKE
A FOOL OF YOURSELF.

40:32.163 --> 40:35.867
- TEDDY, YOU ARE NOT A FOOL.

40:35.901 --> 40:36.935
IT TAKES A LOT OF COURAGE

40:36.968 --> 40:39.905
TO--TO SPEAK
WHAT'S IN YOUR HEART,

40:39.938 --> 40:43.108
MORE COURAGE THAN SAVING
THE WORLD FROM ARCH-VILLAINS.

40:43.141 --> 40:45.977
- THAT'S ME.
PATHETIC-MAN.

40:46.011 --> 40:48.847
- YOU'RE NOT PATHETIC.

40:48.880 --> 40:52.050
YOU'RE FUNNY
AND--AND WITTY.

40:52.083 --> 40:53.084
YOU'RE BRILLIANT.

40:53.118 --> 40:54.720
- SPARE ME THE FLATTERY.

40:54.753 --> 40:56.021
- IT'S TRUE.

40:56.054 --> 40:57.656
THAT--THAT'S WHAT
MAKES YOU SEXY,

40:57.689 --> 41:01.793
BECAUSE YOU'RE
SO, SO SMART.

41:01.827 --> 41:03.228
YOU KNOW WHAT
THEY SAY, THE--

41:03.261 --> 41:08.600
THE BRAIN IS
THE SECOND SEXIEST ORGAN.

41:08.634 --> 41:12.938
WHICH IS NOT TO SAY THAT
THE REST OF YOU IS NOT HOT.

41:12.971 --> 41:15.807
I MEAN, HI.
FEEL THOSE PECS.

41:15.841 --> 41:17.976
THEY'RE HARD AS A ROCK.

41:18.009 --> 41:19.911
AND, UM, HELLO.
HELLO, TED.

41:19.945 --> 41:22.714
THAT'S A NICE LITTLE SIX-PACK
YOU'VE GOT GOING THERE.

41:22.748 --> 41:24.215
- IT'S MORE OF A FOUR-PACK,
REALLY.

41:24.249 --> 41:26.718
- [laughs]

41:26.752 --> 41:30.155
YOU'RE SO FUNNY.

41:30.188 --> 41:31.222
AND THOSE--

41:31.256 --> 41:34.660
THOSE BIG PUPPY-DOG EYES,

41:34.693 --> 41:36.928
YOU COULD
JUST DIVE RIGHT IN.

41:40.699 --> 41:43.001
AND--

41:43.034 --> 41:47.573
AND YOUR LIPS ARE--

41:47.606 --> 41:51.276
THEY'RE SO, UM--

41:51.309 --> 41:52.243
SO--

42:01.887 --> 42:03.755
JESUS, WHAT THE HELL
DID THEY PUT IN THOSE DRINKS?

42:03.789 --> 42:04.856
- BARTENDER, TWO MORE.

42:16.902 --> 42:19.237
[both speaking indistinctly]

42:22.073 --> 42:23.875
- THERE YOU ARE!

42:23.909 --> 42:25.310
- HAVING FUN?

42:25.343 --> 42:27.145
- YEAH, IT'S GREAT.

42:27.178 --> 42:29.314
- YOU KNOW, BRIAN'S LOOKING
FOR YOU.

42:29.347 --> 42:32.050
- HE IS?
- WELL, OF COURSE!

42:32.083 --> 42:33.752
- IT'S YOUR BIG NIGHT, SWEETIE.

42:33.785 --> 42:35.286
HE WANTS TO BE WITH YOU.

42:45.964 --> 42:49.067
- I BET TIBET'S GOING
TO SEEM QUIET AFTER THIS.

42:49.100 --> 42:50.802
- YEAH, NO DANCING,

42:50.836 --> 42:52.604
NO DRINKING, NO DRUGS.

42:52.638 --> 42:53.805
- GET IT WHILE YOU CAN.

42:53.839 --> 42:56.041
- YEAH, WHAT DO YOU THINK
I'M DOING?

42:56.074 --> 42:57.042
- I WANT YOU TO KNOW,
I'M NOT GOING

42:57.075 --> 42:59.778
TO COME HERE
WITHOUT YOU.

42:59.811 --> 43:01.813
- I APPRECIATE
THE SELFLESS SACRIFICE.

43:01.847 --> 43:04.215
- I'LL BE SITTING AT HOME,
KNITTING,

43:04.249 --> 43:05.884
WAITING FOR YOUR RETURN.

43:05.917 --> 43:07.052
- I DON'T WANT YOU
NOT TO HAVE FUN.

43:07.085 --> 43:08.053
- DON'T WORRY,

43:08.086 --> 43:09.988
I INTEND
TO HAVE PLENTY OF FUN.

43:10.021 --> 43:14.292
ALTHOUGH PHONE SEX
TO TIBET WILL BE EXPENSIVE.

43:14.325 --> 43:18.830
- I'M AFRAID THERE WON'T BE
MUCH OF THAT, MICHAEL.

43:18.864 --> 43:20.832
- 'CAUSE YOU HAVE TO
BE CELIBATE.

43:20.866 --> 43:22.668
- 'CAUSE I'M NOT GOING.

43:27.438 --> 43:28.907
- BUT IT'S ALL
YOU'VE THOUGHT ABOUT,

43:28.940 --> 43:30.408
IT'S ALL YOU'VE TALKED ABOUT.

43:30.441 --> 43:32.944
- AND YOU WERE WILLING
TO LET ME GO.

43:35.380 --> 43:36.882
- YOU SAID IT WAS
WHAT YOU NEEDED.

43:36.915 --> 43:39.918
- I ALREADY HAVE WHAT I NEED.

43:39.951 --> 43:42.020
BABY, I DON'T HAVE TO GO
TO TIBET TO FIND IT.

44:24.062 --> 44:25.997
- [moans]

44:41.813 --> 44:44.182
- * SO TRUST ME HERE

44:44.215 --> 44:46.051
* NO ONE CAN

45:15.446 --> 45:19.217
- I WAS PRACTICING
THE BEETHOVEN.

45:19.250 --> 45:21.019
IT SOUNDED LIKE SHIT,
AND I REALIZED,

45:21.052 --> 45:23.889
IT'S ALL YOUR FAULT.

45:23.922 --> 45:25.824
- MY FAULT?

45:25.857 --> 45:29.094
- I TRIED TO FORGET ABOUT YOU,
BUT I CAN'T.

45:29.127 --> 45:30.996
YOU'RE ALL I THINK ABOUT.
