00:31.940 --> 00:33.660
Antarctica.

00:37.180 --> 00:42.220
The coldest, the harshest and the
most remote continent on Earth.

00:49.540 --> 00:54.300
No human being has ever descended
into the depths that surround it...

00:57.460 --> 00:58.940
until now.

01:06.100 --> 01:10.660
The deep ocean is as challenging to
explore as space.

01:13.820 --> 01:17.619
We know more about the surface of
Mars than we do about the

01:17.620 --> 01:19.340
deepest parts of our seas.

01:43.020 --> 01:47.219
Now we can dive these uncharted
depths to discover

01:47.220 --> 01:49.460
what secrets lie beneath.

02:24.220 --> 02:28.619
Sinking down beside the submerged
wall of an iceberg,

02:28.620 --> 02:31.060
we enter an unforgiving world.

02:41.300 --> 02:44.460
These waters are
the coldest on Earth.

02:49.100 --> 02:53.900
As we descend into the deep, the
pressure increases relentlessly.

03:11.380 --> 03:14.420
And the light from above
all but disappears.

03:21.860 --> 03:23.700
Yet, incredibly...

03:27.300 --> 03:29.140
there is life here.

03:50.820 --> 03:54.339
We might have expected that, deep
beneath the surface of

03:54.340 --> 03:58.780
the polar seas, the waters would be
truly barren.

04:06.620 --> 04:11.260
But in fact we find life here in
unimaginable abundance.

04:25.420 --> 04:29.660
Nor is such great abundance confined
to Antarctic waters.

04:33.020 --> 04:37.259
Currents carry this richness into
the depths of almost every ocean

04:37.260 --> 04:39.300
around the world.

04:43.420 --> 04:45.579
Astonishingly, in the deep sea,

04:45.580 --> 04:49.260
there is more life than anywhere
else on Earth.

05:16.700 --> 05:20.580
The sunlight fades
and the seas darken.

05:24.500 --> 05:27.299
Here in the Pacific,
200 metres down,

05:27.300 --> 05:30.300
we enter an alien world.

05:32.780 --> 05:35.219
The Twilight Zone -

05:35.220 --> 05:37.980
a sea of eternal gloom.

05:45.860 --> 05:47.940
There are strange creatures here.

05:49.620 --> 05:50.780
A pyrosome.

05:52.140 --> 05:57.939
A tube of jelly two metres long that
dwarfs a visitor from above -

05:57.940 --> 05:59.980
an oceanic whitetip shark.

06:08.820 --> 06:12.500
Only a tiny amount of light filters
down this far.

06:17.380 --> 06:21.900
Survival here means making the most
of every last glimmer.

06:31.540 --> 06:32.900
A swordfish.

06:41.740 --> 06:44.179
Its eyes are as big as tennis balls,

06:44.180 --> 06:46.780
to help it see
in the perpetual dusk.

06:52.420 --> 06:53.739
A squid,

06:53.740 --> 06:56.060
but this is one
that lives only here.

06:57.580 --> 07:00.260
Its right eye looks
permanently downwards.

07:02.900 --> 07:06.539
But its left eye is much bigger and
trained upwards to detect the

07:06.540 --> 07:09.820
silhouettes of prey
swimming nearer the surface.

07:12.380 --> 07:15.500
No wonder it's nicknamed
"the cockeyed squid".

07:21.860 --> 07:23.500
And even stranger.

07:26.060 --> 07:27.980
This is barreleye...

07:31.060 --> 07:34.499
a fish with a transparent head

07:34.500 --> 07:39.220
filled with jelly so that it can
look up through its skull.

07:56.460 --> 08:01.059
We now know that the Twilight Zone
is a refuge for an incredible

08:01.060 --> 08:04.260
90% of all fish in the ocean.

08:10.380 --> 08:15.779
Only at night do vast shoals of
lanternfish migrate to the surface

08:15.780 --> 08:17.700
to feed on tiny plankton.

08:29.140 --> 08:31.900
By day, they retreat back down here.

08:47.860 --> 08:49.420
Humboldt squid.

09:02.140 --> 09:05.020
Two metres long
and 50 kilos in weight.

09:10.300 --> 09:13.420
Like most squid,
they're voracious hunters.

09:20.980 --> 09:22.620
There are hundreds of them.

09:33.940 --> 09:36.259
They've found a shoal
of lanternfish,

09:36.260 --> 09:39.620
hiding 800 metres down,
off the coast of South America.

09:52.660 --> 09:55.339
Their tentacles are armed with
powerful suckers

09:55.340 --> 09:57.260
with which they grab their prey.

10:13.660 --> 10:16.260
And when there are no more
lanternfish to be found...

10:18.740 --> 10:20.980
they turn on each other.

10:31.860 --> 10:35.300
This squid has caught a smaller one
in its tentacles.

10:40.220 --> 10:42.419
To hide its capture from the rest,

10:42.420 --> 10:44.780
it releases a smokescreen
of black ink.

10:57.700 --> 11:00.380
But then an even bigger one
challenges it...

11:07.300 --> 11:09.140
and steals its catch.

11:18.380 --> 11:22.660
The Twilight Zone is the Humboldt
squid's favoured hunting ground.

11:24.300 --> 11:25.900
They seldom go deeper...

11:27.540 --> 11:30.700
into the world of perpetual
blackness below...

11:36.020 --> 11:37.780
The Midnight Zone.

11:48.660 --> 11:53.140
Two thirds of a mile from the
surface, beyond the reach the sun.

11:58.940 --> 12:01.219
A giant black void,

12:01.220 --> 12:05.220
larger than all the rest of the
world's habitats combined.

12:10.300 --> 12:11.820
There's life here...

12:13.460 --> 12:15.300
but not as we know it.

12:26.220 --> 12:30.180
Alien-like creatures produce
dazzling displays of light.

12:43.180 --> 12:47.620
Nearly all animals need to attract
mates and repel predators.

12:50.540 --> 12:54.819
This language of light is so
widespread here that these signals

12:54.820 --> 12:58.499
are probably the commonest
form of communication

12:58.500 --> 13:01.060
on the entire planet.

13:02.620 --> 13:05.540
And yet we still know
little about them.

13:29.460 --> 13:32.779
Hunters illuminate themselves,
and by doing so

13:32.780 --> 13:34.700
attract inquisitive prey.

13:47.220 --> 13:49.260
This is fangtooth.

13:51.340 --> 13:55.060
It has the largest teeth for its
size of any fish.

13:57.820 --> 14:01.939
There are pressure sensors all over
its head and body which can detect

14:01.940 --> 14:04.340
anything moving
in the surrounding water.

14:11.100 --> 14:14.500
It's the Midnight Zone's
most voracious fish.

14:16.660 --> 14:19.620
But prey use light as a distraction.

14:24.500 --> 14:26.940
A decoy of luminous ink.

14:36.420 --> 14:38.620
Down here, in this blackness...

14:40.700 --> 14:44.020
creatures live beyond
the normal rules of time.

14:50.940 --> 14:54.499
Siphonophores are virtually eternal.

14:54.500 --> 14:56.900
They repeatedly clone themselves...

14:58.340 --> 15:01.780
some eventually growing longer
than a blue whale.

15:26.060 --> 15:28.580
Down here it snows.

15:37.180 --> 15:40.179
Continuous clouds of organic debris

15:40.180 --> 15:42.620
drift slowly down from above.

15:49.740 --> 15:53.139
This is food, and a whole variety

15:53.140 --> 15:55.860
of filter feeders depend on it.

15:59.260 --> 16:00.620
Jellyfish...

16:08.900 --> 16:11.460
and delicate sea cucumbers.

16:30.500 --> 16:33.859
The 1% of marine snow they miss

16:33.860 --> 16:36.140
eventually settles on the sea floor.

17:04.180 --> 17:08.059
Over millions of years
it forms a layer of mud

17:08.060 --> 17:10.099
up to a mile thick.

17:14.619 --> 17:16.939
It's an empty plain that covers

17:16.940 --> 17:19.260
half the surface of our planet.

17:45.220 --> 17:49.340
The deep sea bed
may at first appear lifeless...

17:51.580 --> 17:55.740
but it's home to
a unique cast of mud-dwellers.

17:58.660 --> 18:00.060
The sea toad.

18:02.940 --> 18:06.940
It is an ambush predator
with an enormous mouth...

18:08.660 --> 18:10.620
and infinite patience.

18:21.300 --> 18:24.379
This fish has been living
for so long here

18:24.380 --> 18:26.139
that its fins have changed

18:26.140 --> 18:27.940
into something more useful.

18:33.940 --> 18:35.740
Feet.

18:40.300 --> 18:43.300
They help it shuffle about
on the sea floor.

19:03.580 --> 19:05.500
The flapjack octopus.

19:10.780 --> 19:14.899
It hovers just above the surface of
the mud as it delicately sifts

19:14.900 --> 19:17.380
through it, searching for worms.

19:20.780 --> 19:24.220
But it can jet away at
the first sign of danger.

19:43.220 --> 19:46.380
A sixgill shark
as big as a great white.

19:47.900 --> 19:51.100
It may not have eaten
for an entire year.

19:57.740 --> 19:59.699
It patrols the mud plains

19:59.700 --> 20:02.340
using a minimum amount of energy.

20:16.140 --> 20:18.939
High above, the carcass of a huge

20:18.940 --> 20:21.740
sperm whale is slowly decaying.

20:28.420 --> 20:31.460
This will be a bonanza for the
creatures of the deep.

20:32.700 --> 20:35.780
Food, 30 tonnes of it.

20:49.020 --> 20:52.540
Finally, it settles
on the ocean floor...

20:54.580 --> 20:57.060
and its presence is soon detected.

21:06.860 --> 21:11.700
Sixgill sharks have an
exceptionally acute sense of smell.

21:16.300 --> 21:20.140
Just 25 minutes after the whale's
carcass arrives...

21:22.300 --> 21:24.180
a sixgill finds it.

21:45.420 --> 21:48.660
Each bite releases blood
into the current.

22:30.060 --> 22:33.260
The news that food is here
spreads quickly.

22:41.540 --> 22:44.860
Two more ravenous sixgills arrive.

22:53.620 --> 22:55.219
Within 12 hours,

22:55.220 --> 22:57.139
there are seven enormous sharks

22:57.140 --> 23:01.020
jostling with one another as they
compete to tear off mouthfuls.

23:13.340 --> 23:15.700
No-one is prepared to back off.

23:59.100 --> 24:03.220
24 hours later and a third of the
carcass has gone.

24:34.860 --> 24:38.780
The first arrival has gorged until
it's completely full.

24:43.900 --> 24:48.980
This single meal may be enough to
sustain it for a whole year.

24:55.460 --> 24:58.460
Now the clean-up team arrives.

25:01.700 --> 25:05.379
Spider crabs carrying coral
in their hind legs,

25:05.380 --> 25:08.300
presumably as makeshift body armour.

25:16.540 --> 25:18.260
There are rock crabs here, too.

25:21.180 --> 25:25.100
They probably detected the carcass
almost as soon as the sharks...

25:26.820 --> 25:28.660
but they can't move as fast.

25:33.340 --> 25:35.619
A month on, and over 30 species of

25:35.620 --> 25:38.219
scavenger are clearing away the last

25:38.220 --> 25:39.740
edible fragments.

25:42.420 --> 25:46.340
But now the scavengers are
attracting their own predators.

25:52.740 --> 25:55.939
Scabbardfish,
habitually swimming upright,

25:55.940 --> 25:57.700
are picking them off one by one.

26:19.020 --> 26:22.859
Some of the whale's teeth have been
dislodged as the skeleton starts to

26:22.860 --> 26:24.300
fall apart.

26:27.620 --> 26:32.220
Four months later, there is nothing
left but a few bones.

26:39.940 --> 26:41.700
But even they are food...

26:45.860 --> 26:47.220
for something.

26:54.140 --> 26:55.820
Zombie worms.

26:59.740 --> 27:03.180
They tunnel into the bones by
injecting acid...

27:04.180 --> 27:08.060
and so reach the tiny amounts of
fat that still remain there.

27:10.460 --> 27:12.819
It may take decades, but eventually

27:12.820 --> 27:15.979
the last of the bones will crumble

27:15.980 --> 27:18.459
and the whole 30-tonne carcass

27:18.460 --> 27:20.500
will have been recycled.

27:27.700 --> 27:30.699
A whale fall is a temporary oasis

27:30.700 --> 27:32.900
in the desert of the sea floor.

27:36.300 --> 27:38.780
But there are permanent
oases here, too.

27:52.940 --> 27:55.579
Rocks projecting above the mud

27:55.580 --> 27:58.540
provide anchorage
for deep-sea corals.

28:16.980 --> 28:20.499
As far down as 3.5 miles,

28:20.500 --> 28:23.699
there are more species of coral
in the deep

28:23.700 --> 28:26.220
than on shallow tropical reefs.

28:34.660 --> 28:36.859
Without sunlight,

28:36.860 --> 28:39.580
they rely solely
on food drifting in the current.

28:43.420 --> 28:48.060
And they grow just
a hair's breadth a year.

28:53.780 --> 28:57.420
But some of them can live
for 4,000 years.

29:04.140 --> 29:07.499
They, like their shallow water
relatives,

29:07.500 --> 29:10.420
provide homes for
all kinds of other creatures.

29:35.980 --> 29:40.540
Growing among the corals is one of
the most beautiful of sponges.

29:44.260 --> 29:47.580
This is Venus' flower basket.

29:55.260 --> 29:57.100
These sponges have lodgers.

29:58.340 --> 30:00.100
Shrimps.

30:07.980 --> 30:10.459
There are plenty of predators
on the reef,

30:10.460 --> 30:12.300
so the shrimps are fortunate.

30:16.900 --> 30:20.419
Both this male and female were swept
into this sponge

30:20.420 --> 30:22.259
when they were tiny larvae,

30:22.260 --> 30:24.339
along with the minute particles of

30:24.340 --> 30:26.660
food on which the sponge feeds.

30:30.900 --> 30:34.340
They found each other and have been
here ever since.

30:49.540 --> 30:51.379
Now they're full-grown

30:51.380 --> 30:53.860
and the female is carrying eggs.

31:06.980 --> 31:10.940
Once hatched, the larvae will swim
out through the sponge's walls.

31:17.300 --> 31:19.740
But the shrimps will never leave.

31:21.100 --> 31:22.620
They can't.

31:28.860 --> 31:32.259
They are now far too big to go out
the way they came in,

31:32.260 --> 31:36.099
and no doubt they will live longer
here than they would

31:36.100 --> 31:39.980
if they were wandering about on the
reef unprotected.

31:52.780 --> 31:57.259
But how one of the simplest of all
animals, a sponge,

31:57.260 --> 32:00.779
is able to build
such a complex structure,

32:00.780 --> 32:02.980
to the great benefit of the
shrimps...

32:04.380 --> 32:06.619
is a mystery...

32:06.620 --> 32:08.740
and surely a marvel.

32:25.700 --> 32:30.220
But today their timeless world is
being reduced to rubble.

32:38.580 --> 32:42.859
As overfishing empties the
surface waters of the seas,

32:42.860 --> 32:46.500
trawlers have started
to ransack the deep.

32:49.940 --> 32:52.659
Now countless numbers of the reefs

32:52.660 --> 32:55.059
that have flourished here
for millennia

32:55.060 --> 32:56.900
lie in ruins.

33:26.740 --> 33:31.220
Over time, organic matter on the sea
floor slowly decays...

33:32.260 --> 33:33.780
producing methane.

34:35.260 --> 34:37.219
In the Gulf of Mexico

34:37.219 --> 34:41.100
these eruptions also release
a super-salty liquid.

34:49.100 --> 34:50.699
Brine.

35:01.620 --> 35:04.739
Five times heavier than seawater,

35:04.740 --> 35:08.060
it accumulates in great pools
on the sea floor.

35:13.860 --> 35:16.340
It's difficult to make sense
of the sight.

35:23.660 --> 35:28.659
A lake of concentrated saltwater,
15 metres deep

35:28.660 --> 35:30.900
at the bottom of the sea.

35:39.100 --> 35:42.499
Around its margin,
perhaps even more strangely,

35:42.500 --> 35:45.140
there is a profusion of life.

35:52.140 --> 35:56.059
Giant mussels, that can live and
grow for a century or more,

35:56.060 --> 35:58.139
pack tightly together,

35:58.140 --> 36:01.860
dwarfing the shrimps and squat
lobsters that feed around them.

36:30.660 --> 36:33.699
Cutthroat eels, scavengers,

36:33.700 --> 36:37.700
come to the shores of the brine lake
in search of something edible.

36:46.500 --> 36:49.460
Some even venture into the brine.

37:22.940 --> 37:24.779
Spending too long in it

37:24.780 --> 37:27.380
can send an eel into toxic shock.

37:39.220 --> 37:41.860
Its only hope is to rise above it.

37:56.660 --> 37:58.300
It manages to escape.

38:07.460 --> 38:09.140
Others are not so lucky.

38:16.540 --> 38:18.860
The brine embalms their bodies...

38:20.660 --> 38:23.259
and the casualties of decades

38:23.260 --> 38:25.660
accumulate around the margins.

38:45.660 --> 38:49.100
But parts of the deep are
even more hostile.

38:56.700 --> 39:00.659
In places, gigantic cracks stretch
for many miles

39:00.660 --> 39:02.740
across the ocean floor...

39:17.660 --> 39:21.420
canyons that plunge towards the
centre of the Earth.

39:28.860 --> 39:33.859
Scans from survey vessels make it
possible to graphically reconstruct

39:33.860 --> 39:36.900
an image of this
vast submarine landscape.

39:44.740 --> 39:47.899
The deepest of all,
at almost seven miles,

39:47.900 --> 39:50.740
is the Mariana Trench
in the Pacific Ocean.

39:56.700 --> 40:00.060
Even Mount Everest
could disappear inside it.

40:15.260 --> 40:18.579
Down here, in these deep ravines,

40:18.580 --> 40:22.580
it was once thought that nothing
whatever could possibly survive.

40:29.740 --> 40:32.300
But there is life even here...

40:39.140 --> 40:40.700
a kind of sea slug.

40:48.380 --> 40:50.380
A so-called "sea pig".

40:52.500 --> 40:56.699
They, and other simple creatures,
manage to survive on the

40:56.700 --> 41:00.180
minuscule amount of food
that drifts down here.

41:03.620 --> 41:05.339
Like this starfish,

41:05.340 --> 41:09.299
they can withstand pressure
equivalent of 50 jumbo jets

41:09.300 --> 41:11.460
stacked on top of one another.

41:32.700 --> 41:35.059
A remote camera probe reveals

41:35.060 --> 41:37.740
the most extraordinary
discovery of all...

41:45.260 --> 41:48.260
the ethereal snailfish.

41:52.140 --> 41:54.299
At five miles down,

41:54.300 --> 41:57.940
this is the deepest living fish
so far discovered.

42:04.220 --> 42:07.019
No-one imagined that an animal as

42:07.020 --> 42:09.699
complex as a fish could exist

42:09.700 --> 42:11.700
in such extreme pressures.

42:23.900 --> 42:27.299
From the greatest depths to the
uppermost limit of

42:27.300 --> 42:31.819
the Twilight Zone, it seems that
there is nowhere in the deep sea

42:31.820 --> 42:34.580
where life of some kind
can't survive.

42:39.420 --> 42:42.299
And we now think that the deep sea
may well be

42:42.300 --> 42:44.100
where life on Earth began.

42:57.980 --> 43:00.899
Here, in a world hidden within

43:00.900 --> 43:03.940
the greatest geological
feature on Earth...

43:07.540 --> 43:10.419
running right down the middle of
the world's oceans,

43:10.420 --> 43:15.140
an underwater mountain range,
spanning the entire globe.

43:20.260 --> 43:21.980
The Mid-Ocean Ridge.

43:36.140 --> 43:37.939
In the South Pacific,

43:37.940 --> 43:40.580
the ocean floor is being torn apart.

44:53.020 --> 44:56.019
Over three quarters of the planet's
volcanic activity

44:56.020 --> 44:57.820
occurs in the deep...

45:05.180 --> 45:08.780
almost all of it along the
Mid-Ocean Ridge.

45:12.780 --> 45:17.220
But from this titanic violence
come great riches.

45:26.460 --> 45:29.980
Gases and scalding water gush up
through the crevices.

45:39.340 --> 45:43.540
Minerals condensing from these jets
build up great chimneys...

45:45.260 --> 45:46.940
hydrothermal vents.

45:50.860 --> 45:52.899
This one, 30 metres tall,

45:52.900 --> 45:54.980
has been named Godzilla.

46:03.660 --> 46:05.699
Astonishingly, we now know

46:05.700 --> 46:07.659
that they hold as much life

46:07.660 --> 46:09.660
as tropical rainforests.

46:17.500 --> 46:21.379
In places, half a million
individual animals

46:21.380 --> 46:24.460
are crammed into
a single square metre.

46:36.820 --> 46:39.660
They depend entirely for
their food on bacteria.

46:42.900 --> 46:47.660
And THEY feed on chemicals dissolved
in the searingly hot fluid.

46:54.620 --> 46:59.740
Crabs consume the bacterial mats
that coat their shells.

47:13.580 --> 47:16.419
Others maintain bacterial cultures

47:16.420 --> 47:18.820
actually within their bodies.

47:25.300 --> 47:28.300
Shrimps carry such cultures
in their mouthparts,

47:29.460 --> 47:31.940
but that is a strategy
fraught with danger.

47:36.660 --> 47:40.379
To provide sustenance
for these microbes

47:40.380 --> 47:43.940
the shrimps must dash
into the hot vents...

47:45.860 --> 47:48.660
and that risks being boiled alive.

48:02.460 --> 48:04.379
In the last decade

48:04.380 --> 48:07.940
the number of hydrothermal vents
discovered has doubled.

48:15.900 --> 48:19.580
Every one has its own unique
character and community.

48:26.620 --> 48:30.500
But perhaps the most important one
of all is in the Atlantic.

48:32.140 --> 48:34.660
It has been named "The Lost City".

48:39.100 --> 48:41.859
Within its 60-metre towers,

48:41.860 --> 48:44.980
something truly extraordinary
is taking place.

48:48.980 --> 48:53.859
Under extremes of pressure and
temperature, hydrocarbons -

48:53.860 --> 48:58.859
the molecules that are the basic
component of all living things -

48:58.860 --> 49:01.940
are being created spontaneously.

49:13.540 --> 49:16.699
Indeed, many scientists now believe

49:16.700 --> 49:19.419
that life on Earth may have begun

49:19.420 --> 49:22.139
around a vent like this,

49:22.140 --> 49:24.900
four billion years ago.

49:43.940 --> 49:46.859
We now know that there are deep seas

49:46.860 --> 49:49.780
on the moons of Jupiter and Saturn.

49:56.700 --> 49:58.779
If life can exist under such

49:58.780 --> 50:01.379
extreme conditions down here,

50:01.380 --> 50:03.739
then surely it could exist

50:03.740 --> 50:05.740
somewhere out there.

50:30.980 --> 50:35.179
The team spent more than 1,000 hours
filming in the deep ocean,

50:35.180 --> 50:39.979
mostly from the research vessel
Alucia and her twin submersibles,

50:39.980 --> 50:42.060
Deep Rover and Nadir.

50:47.460 --> 50:50.620
Their most ambitious mission
was to Antarctica,

50:51.780 --> 50:54.779
hoping to film life
two thirds of a mile down,

50:54.780 --> 50:56.620
something never attempted before.

51:02.140 --> 51:04.739
We honestly do not know what we're
going to find down there.

51:04.740 --> 51:08.099
We're going to a place that has
never been explored.

51:08.100 --> 51:10.779
There could be nothing,
there could be a carpet of life,

51:10.780 --> 51:13.620
there could be anything in between.
Who knows?

51:17.740 --> 51:19.980
It's a huge technical challenge.

51:27.100 --> 51:31.940
The water temperature here can reach
minus 1.8 Centigrade.

51:37.220 --> 51:40.019
No-one knows for sure
how the subs will cope

51:40.020 --> 51:41.860
with this extreme environment.

51:47.580 --> 51:50.939
OK. Right, I'm going to soak it up.
OK.

51:50.940 --> 51:53.859
Just half an hour into the very
first dive,

51:53.860 --> 51:56.460
a puddle is forming
on the floor of the sub.

52:00.100 --> 52:02.100
Orla confirms it's seawater.

52:03.700 --> 52:07.699
Yeah, Roger. I'm just try to soak up
this puddle of water,

52:07.700 --> 52:09.860
and then see if any more comes.

52:10.860 --> 52:14.619
They must find the leak
and repair it fast.

52:14.620 --> 52:17.139
Are you going to knock that over
my...? Yeah.

52:17.140 --> 52:21.499
You're at 450 metres in a small
bubble and water's coming in.

52:21.500 --> 52:25.219
That's a half an hour straight shot
back up to the surface.

52:25.220 --> 52:27.179
You're kind of thinking about,

52:27.180 --> 52:30.780
"Are we going to fill up with water?
And if we are, there's no way out!"

52:32.020 --> 52:33.579
Yeah.

52:33.580 --> 52:36.659
The sub pilots are well drilled for
emergencies.

52:39.380 --> 52:42.019
Just pass them over. Yeah.

52:42.020 --> 52:44.980
Ralph quickly finds the flood
and fixes it.

52:46.940 --> 52:50.179
He made it all seem absolutely
ordinary and normal and,

52:50.180 --> 52:52.579
"I've got this covered,
don't you worry,"

52:52.580 --> 52:54.340
and within 20 minutes, he did.

52:59.860 --> 53:03.379
The waters of the Antarctic Sound
are potentially rich

53:03.380 --> 53:05.140
but also treacherous.

53:06.580 --> 53:10.780
The Sound is ominously known as
"Iceberg Alley".

53:12.460 --> 53:15.379
We've got to find a place where we
can get the submarines down and up

53:15.380 --> 53:18.099
safely without any icebergs coming
along and bowling them over.

53:18.100 --> 53:21.540
I've got a feeling it's going to be
a bit like a game of Space Invaders.

53:22.900 --> 53:25.419
A metre cube of ice weighs a tonne.

53:25.420 --> 53:29.219
You start sort of grinding that
around the sphere, it's delicate.

53:29.220 --> 53:31.100
It's like a big Faberge egg.

53:33.860 --> 53:38.020
One dive brings them right up to the
underside face of an iceberg.

53:41.140 --> 53:44.619
There are icebergs up there that are
the size of a small car, and

53:44.620 --> 53:48.979
then there are icebergs up there
that are the size of Hyde Park.

53:48.980 --> 53:50.380
Enormous.

53:52.020 --> 53:54.580
Conditions here
can change in an instant.

53:55.820 --> 53:57.900
The captain radios down to the subs.

54:02.500 --> 54:03.860
Yeah, Roger that.

54:05.420 --> 54:08.019
We've currently got a couple of big
icebergs coming down

54:08.020 --> 54:11.100
the channel, and it looks like
they're on a collision course.

54:14.420 --> 54:18.699
The impact of two icebergs colliding
overhead is clearly heard.

54:22.060 --> 54:23.540
That is ice.

54:26.020 --> 54:29.699
With icebergs colliding above and
the weather turning fast,

54:29.700 --> 54:31.300
the subs are quickly recalled.

54:38.980 --> 54:41.100
Once again
their efforts are thwarted.

54:52.180 --> 54:55.940
Finally, after two weeks,
conditions are just right.

54:57.060 --> 55:01.820
Once again the team attempt their
1,000-metre dive in Iceberg Alley.

55:05.700 --> 55:09.340
An hour after leaving the surface
they close in on their goal.

55:13.380 --> 55:14.820
999.

55:18.740 --> 55:20.459
Control, control.

55:20.460 --> 55:22.059
This is Nadir

55:22.060 --> 55:27.059
on bottom, depth -
one-zero-zero-zero metres.

55:27.060 --> 55:29.179
Roger. Depth - 1,000 metres.

55:29.180 --> 55:31.380
Control out. New record!

55:33.660 --> 55:37.300
First manned sub dive
to 1,000 metres in Antarctica!

55:39.340 --> 55:42.259
At the bottom of the ocean, at the
end of the world,

55:42.260 --> 55:45.220
the amount of life they find is
astonishing.

55:50.980 --> 55:53.939
But they are equally astonished
to find that,

55:53.940 --> 55:56.339
two thirds of a mile from the
surface,

55:56.340 --> 55:58.260
icebergs are still a danger.

56:00.260 --> 56:03.139
Rocks can drop from them
as they melt,

56:03.140 --> 56:06.140
and one lands
right in front of the sub.

56:08.780 --> 56:11.939
I don't think many people who are
diving subs

56:11.940 --> 56:15.380
ever consider big lumps of rock
landing on them.

56:16.780 --> 56:18.819
It's, it's not your normal risk.

56:18.820 --> 56:20.299
If it had hit the sphere,

56:20.300 --> 56:23.299
there's a good chance it would have
put a nice scratch down it.

56:23.300 --> 56:26.659
If something of ten, 15, 20 tonnes
had hit the sub,

56:26.660 --> 56:28.300
it would completely destroy it.

56:32.580 --> 56:34.659
But over the following dives

56:34.660 --> 56:37.699
the team learns it's these
very drop stones

56:37.700 --> 56:40.500
that enrich the Antarctic
deep sea bed,

56:41.660 --> 56:45.220
creating firm anchor points
for life to thrive.

56:49.900 --> 56:53.579
Proof that the only way to fully
appreciate the complexity and

56:53.580 --> 56:57.900
abundance of life in the deep
is to go there ourselves.

57:06.420 --> 57:09.980
Next time, we travel to bustling
coral reefs.

57:16.420 --> 57:20.739
Here, animals must go to
extraordinary lengths

57:20.740 --> 57:24.500
to get ahead of the competition in
these crowded cities.
