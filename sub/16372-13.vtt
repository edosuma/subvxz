WEBVTT

00:27.400 --> 00:28.550
Got him good.

00:54.240 --> 00:56.630
I get a kick out of this job.

01:21.480 --> 01:24.040
Tom. Tom, honey, wake up.

01:24.200 --> 01:26.237
- I was feeding Agnes...
- What happened?

01:26.440 --> 01:27.590
No, no, she's fine.

01:28.640 --> 01:31.235
I was watching the news...

01:31.720 --> 01:34.076
...and there was a plane crash.

01:34.680 --> 01:37.400
Honey, it was your father's plane.

01:38.800 --> 01:39.950
He died.

01:43.880 --> 01:46.952
<i>Authorities have confirmed
the plane belongs to Howard Hargrave...</i>

01:47.120 --> 01:51.319
<i>...a sometimes controversial figure in the
field of private military contracting.</i>

01:51.480 --> 01:54.314
<i>His firm, Halcyon Aegis,
is among the largest...</i>

01:57.400 --> 02:00.040
- I'm sorry.
- For what?

02:00.200 --> 02:03.318
Not gonna pretend I feel something
when I don't.

02:10.960 --> 02:13.520
- Honey, he was your father.
- I guess.

02:13.680 --> 02:14.830
Never really knew him.

02:16.080 --> 02:18.515
I know it sounds cold,
but my father, my mother, that family...

02:18.680 --> 02:22.276
- ...whoever they are, I'm not interested.
- Come on. You must have questions.

02:22.440 --> 02:24.591
When I met my mother,
she offered me a job.

02:24.760 --> 02:27.753
As an operative, which seems
like it would be your dream job.

02:27.960 --> 02:30.555
I meant what I said
when I turned her down.

02:31.120 --> 02:32.554
They're my past.

02:33.000 --> 02:35.834
You and Agnes are my future,
and that's what I care about.

02:36.480 --> 02:39.075
You can care about us
and look for the answers you need.

02:39.240 --> 02:42.790
Well, that's the thing. I'm not really
looking for answers. Except for one.

02:44.560 --> 02:47.758
When did I become the old guy
that falls asleep on the couch?

02:49.560 --> 02:51.631
Is it true about the courier?

02:51.800 --> 02:53.120
Yes.

02:53.680 --> 02:55.239
- I'm sorry, Raymond.
- Stratos...

02:55.440 --> 02:58.000
...we have to take the bitter
with the sweet.

02:58.160 --> 03:01.312
Unfortunately, it's not just one courier.

03:01.480 --> 03:03.631
People are talking about other setbacks.

03:05.480 --> 03:09.599
I have a lead
on three cargo ships in Marseille.

03:09.760 --> 03:13.197
If they are as advertised,
we should purchase them.

03:13.360 --> 03:14.999
Your travel itinerary.

03:15.360 --> 03:19.240
I've booked a room for you and Corina
at La Maison de Mon Ami.

03:19.400 --> 03:22.837
A very quiet, lovely villa
on the outskirts of Monte Carlo.

03:23.000 --> 03:26.357
I've put 25,000 on account
in their private casino.

03:26.560 --> 03:28.119
An anniversary present.

03:28.280 --> 03:29.680
Chin up, old friend.

03:29.840 --> 03:33.038
Drink some champagne,
kiss on the balcony...

03:33.200 --> 03:36.034
...tip well at the tables.
We've been through worse.

03:42.440 --> 03:45.831
I'll report back once I've seen the ships.

03:46.000 --> 03:49.596
And for this, thank you so much, Red.

03:54.480 --> 03:56.437
Where in your empire does he fit in?

03:56.600 --> 03:58.910
Mediterranean shipping operations.

03:59.080 --> 04:01.117
You have multiple shipping operations?

04:02.840 --> 04:06.720
A courier of mine was murdered
in Paris last night.

04:06.880 --> 04:10.351
A man named Plumber.
Killed by our next Blacklister.

04:11.800 --> 04:13.439
- Thank you.
- For what?

04:13.600 --> 04:16.957
Admitting up front
why you're giving us this case.

04:17.120 --> 04:18.349
It's a refreshing change.

04:19.800 --> 04:23.111
I heard about Tom's father.
How did Tom react?

04:23.320 --> 04:25.471
- Disinterested.
- Good.

04:25.960 --> 04:27.155
Why do you say that?

04:27.920 --> 04:32.312
The woman you'll be looking for
is quite literally a character assassin.

04:32.480 --> 04:37.396
Her objective is to utterly obliterate
her target by any means necessary.

04:37.560 --> 04:41.759
Scandal, public humiliation,
extortion, theft, murder.

04:41.920 --> 04:44.196
- And her next target is you.
- Yes.

04:44.360 --> 04:47.398
She's ruthless,
and will go to any length...

04:47.880 --> 04:52.511
...to vanquish her victim,
with no regard for collateral damage.

04:53.720 --> 04:56.554
- Me.
- I'm concerned.

04:56.720 --> 04:59.440
- What's her name?
- I only know an alias:

04:59.600 --> 05:02.069
Isabella Stone.

05:02.280 --> 05:04.590
Dr. Eric Bannon,
a world-renowned cardiologist...

05:04.760 --> 05:07.594
...was charged in a series
of angel-of-mercy killings...

05:07.760 --> 05:10.400
...due to lethal
prescription drug interactions...

05:10.560 --> 05:13.553
...that were, in fact,
engineered by Isabella Stone.

05:13.720 --> 05:15.951
- How?
- She hacked Bannon's passwords...

05:16.120 --> 05:18.510
...in order to access
the inpatient dispensary...

05:18.680 --> 05:21.593
...and change the patient's
prescription-drug regimens.

05:21.800 --> 05:22.916
Twelve died.

05:23.080 --> 05:27.393
Now, according to Reddington's sources,
one of the victims had a brother...

05:27.560 --> 05:30.359
...Ryuu Fujimoto,
who engaged Isabella Stone...

05:30.520 --> 05:32.273
...to orchestrate Bannon's downfall.

05:32.680 --> 05:37.152
2011, Bangladesh. A fire broke out
in a Dhaka ghetto sweatshop.

05:37.320 --> 05:39.994
Sixty-eight perished.
Twenty-seven were children.

05:40.160 --> 05:42.470
Subsequent news coverage exposed
horrific working conditions...

05:42.640 --> 05:45.678
...which were blamed
on the factory's primary contractor...

05:45.840 --> 05:50.631
...Fit Thread Jeans, and their CEO,
haute couture designer, Cynthia Brooks.

05:50.800 --> 05:53.315
Now, the scandal rocked the industry.

05:53.480 --> 05:55.233
- Has he been admitted?
- According to Reddington's intel...

05:55.400 --> 05:58.040
- Has the doctor said anything?
- ...Stone and team torched the factory...

05:58.200 --> 06:00.669
- Let me see if I can come out.
- ...on behalf of Brooks's main competitor.

06:00.880 --> 06:02.837
No, I wanna be there.

06:03.000 --> 06:05.117
You said Stone went after one
of Reddington's couriers?

06:05.280 --> 06:07.033
Yes, and one of his accountants.

06:07.200 --> 06:09.590
According to our last Blacklister,
Natalie Luca...

06:09.800 --> 06:11.712
- Typhoid Mary.
- ...Stone hired her...

06:11.880 --> 06:15.112
...to kill Reddington's accountant
and money-launderer, Zack Smoll.

06:15.280 --> 06:16.953
Ressler, Navabi, get with DGSE.

06:17.120 --> 06:18.873
See what they can tell us
about the murdered courier.

06:19.040 --> 06:20.076
With all due respect, sir...

06:20.240 --> 06:22.471
...seems like Reddington gave us
this case to protect himself.

06:22.640 --> 06:26.190
Against someone we should be
interested in taking down anyway.

06:26.400 --> 06:27.959
Can we at least put a clock on it?

06:28.120 --> 06:30.077
Why? There somewhere else
you have to be?

06:30.280 --> 06:33.751
Look, I'm just saying. If it turns out
we do all the heavy lifting for him...

06:33.920 --> 06:35.559
...maybe we shouldn't devote
so much time to it.

06:35.720 --> 06:39.760
I understand there's a line, Ressler.
You think he's crossed it, but I disagree.

06:39.960 --> 06:43.112
Reddington insists his courier's death
was part of a larger threat...

06:43.680 --> 06:45.558
...and we're gonna investigate it.

06:48.200 --> 06:50.476
Everything okay? With the phone call?

06:50.680 --> 06:53.320
- Yeah. It's just stuff.
- Stuff?

06:53.480 --> 06:55.631
Yeah. Stuff. Everything's fine.

06:57.440 --> 06:58.715
Thank you for coming.

06:58.880 --> 07:02.556
We were hoping the DGSE could tell us
about the hit-and-run in Paris.

07:02.720 --> 07:06.430
We actually know very little.
No identification, no cell phone.

07:06.600 --> 07:09.638
We understand he had over
$30,000 in U.S. bills on him.

07:09.800 --> 07:12.235
Counterfeit bills. Untraceable.

07:12.400 --> 07:14.357
We'd like to review
any eyewitness reports.

07:14.520 --> 07:16.910
Well, I'll forward them
from the police prefecture...

07:17.120 --> 07:20.352
...if you tell me why you are
so interested in a random hit-and-run.

07:20.520 --> 07:23.513
- We believe the victim was a courier.
- For whom?

07:23.680 --> 07:26.434
- We're not at liberty to say.
- Raymond Reddington.

07:27.160 --> 07:28.753
Your intel could help us with him.

07:28.920 --> 07:31.674
You will have the eyewitness reports
within the hour.

07:31.840 --> 07:35.117
- As well as surveillance footage.
- You have video from the hit-and-run?

07:35.280 --> 07:40.309
No, of a nearby bar where the victim
had been moments before the incident.

07:41.240 --> 07:44.039
If it helps you find Raymond Reddington
after all these years...

07:44.200 --> 07:46.431
...I'll be happy to help.

07:46.600 --> 07:49.911
<i>Officials have confirmed there were
no survivors in the recent crash...</i>

07:51.680 --> 07:54.070
<i>...of the private plane owned
by CEO of Halcyon Aegis...</i>

07:54.280 --> 07:57.114
<i>...Howard Hargrave.
Investigators are still on the scene.</i>

07:57.280 --> 08:00.796
<i>- We will update you on this story.
- Dembe. Tell him it's me.</i>

08:01.000 --> 08:02.480
We need to talk.

08:04.120 --> 08:06.157
I love this place.

08:06.320 --> 08:08.152
I know you don't like him...

08:08.320 --> 08:09.834
...but Mr. Reddington...

08:10.000 --> 08:12.959
...he takes good care of his people.

08:13.120 --> 08:16.875
Come on. I want to go to the tables.

08:17.040 --> 08:21.193
Darling, I'm basking, and I'm dying
to bask in that beautiful bathtub.

08:21.360 --> 08:23.192
Bask away.

08:23.360 --> 08:26.751
But hurry. I need my good-luck charm.

08:55.360 --> 08:59.240
- Please don't shoot.
- Oh, honey, I'm not gonna shoot you.

08:59.400 --> 09:02.916
The gun is just to make sure you stay
quiet while Charlotte strangles you.

09:25.000 --> 09:26.832
We'll need the dress.

09:35.000 --> 09:37.151
Bypass surgery?

09:38.000 --> 09:39.912
Did you get a second opinion?

09:41.640 --> 09:44.838
Well, when is he scheduled to go under?

09:45.400 --> 09:48.040
Yeah. I'm gonna get there
as soon as I can.

09:49.040 --> 09:50.952
Love you too, Mom.

09:51.120 --> 09:54.636
Hey, extra-large cherry Slurpee
says I can get Mr. Cooper to say:

09:54.800 --> 09:56.917
- "You're going to Fredericksburg."
- What?

09:57.080 --> 10:00.869
- What do we know?
- Okay, so I think I found something.

10:01.040 --> 10:02.440
I've been combing through
the security footage...

10:02.600 --> 10:05.798
...that the Paris police sent us
from the bar, and watch this.

10:11.920 --> 10:13.320
- Do you see it?
- See what?

10:13.480 --> 10:14.550
Hideous sweater.

10:14.720 --> 10:16.632
- Coffee cup in the corner.
- What about him?

10:16.840 --> 10:18.718
He's watching Mr. Reddington's courier.

10:18.880 --> 10:20.951
- What's his tell?
- Okay, check it out.

10:21.120 --> 10:25.876
At 42 minutes and 11 seconds in,
the courier gets up to go.

10:26.040 --> 10:28.430
Now watch the sweater.

10:29.920 --> 10:32.992
- So what? He's thirsty.
- No, no, no. Watch. Watch.

10:33.160 --> 10:35.197
See him hold the cup
in front of his mouth?

10:35.400 --> 10:38.677
- How he is trying to be discreet?
- He's talking into a mic.

10:38.840 --> 10:42.197
And following
Mr. Reddington's courier out the door.

10:42.360 --> 10:45.432
- Can you get a better image?
- I can, and I did.

10:45.600 --> 10:48.718
Courtesy of new software
I downloaded from FAVIAU.

10:49.760 --> 10:52.480
FAVIAU. Forensic Audio, Video,
and Image Analysis Unit.

10:52.640 --> 10:54.677
The chief engineer and I are
in a Hacky Sack circle.

10:54.880 --> 10:56.109
- Hacky Sack?
- Oh, yeah.

10:56.280 --> 10:57.794
They are making a huge comeback.

10:57.960 --> 11:00.111
Footbag workouts are
actually great exercise.

11:00.280 --> 11:02.078
- It's good for balance...
- Sounds great.

11:02.240 --> 11:04.471
- How about that image?
- Right.

11:06.600 --> 11:10.037
- It's a pretty picture. Did you get an ID?
- Yes.

11:10.200 --> 11:13.272
One "Chip" Murphy, former NCIS agent.

11:13.480 --> 11:15.119
- Delaware driver's license.
- Address?

11:15.320 --> 11:17.676
No fixed address
since his discharge five years ago.

11:17.840 --> 11:21.629
But he does own a storage unit
in Fredericksburg, Virginia.

11:21.800 --> 11:23.678
You're going to Fredericksburg.

11:27.120 --> 11:29.316
My father is dead.

11:29.720 --> 11:31.712
She's the only one left
who knows who I am.

11:31.920 --> 11:34.037
You're Elizabeth's husband
and Agnes's father.

11:34.400 --> 11:36.392
Who I was.

11:36.560 --> 11:38.279
Stay away from Scottie Hargrave.

11:38.440 --> 11:40.591
Yeah, I know. You said that.
My question is why?

11:40.800 --> 11:42.553
My question is why not?

11:42.760 --> 11:45.275
You have a wife and a child and a life.

11:45.440 --> 11:49.320
- Leave well enough alone.
- I told Liz I would, that it didn't matter.

11:49.520 --> 11:51.113
And it doesn't.

11:52.000 --> 11:56.631
It wouldn't. Except that you told me not
to let Scottie Hargrave know I'm her son.

11:56.800 --> 11:59.918
That if I did, I would never find
the truth I've been looking for.

12:00.080 --> 12:01.434
What does that mean?

12:01.600 --> 12:03.637
- He's dead, Tom.
- What truth?

12:03.800 --> 12:05.359
You knew my father.

12:05.520 --> 12:08.160
I had a brief professional relationship
with your father.

12:08.320 --> 12:11.438
A man who wrestled
with significant demons.

12:11.600 --> 12:15.480
I know his wife, your mother,
is a manipulative creature...

12:15.640 --> 12:17.518
...whose own husband didn't trust her.

12:17.680 --> 12:21.230
Whose answers to the questions you
wanna ask her could never be trusted.

12:21.400 --> 12:25.394
All that really matters is that you
vanished off the face of the Earth...

12:25.560 --> 12:27.950
...nearly 30 years ago...

12:28.120 --> 12:29.679
...and yet here you are.

12:30.600 --> 12:33.274
Leave the past in the past, Tom.

12:33.480 --> 12:37.269
Nothing good will come
from digging up secrets.

12:38.920 --> 12:42.960
Sorry, sport. I can't let you guys in a
unit unless you guys have a warrant.

12:43.120 --> 12:45.157
Can you confirm
the name of the lessee?

12:45.320 --> 12:48.916
No. Now, if you'll excuse me,
I gotta get back to the front office.

12:49.120 --> 12:51.680
Give us a minute. Okay?
We gotta make a few calls.

12:52.360 --> 12:54.158
Let me call the U.S. Attorney's office
in Richmond.

12:54.320 --> 12:56.710
- Get an ETA on that warrant.
- We don't have time.

12:56.920 --> 12:59.116
Murphy might be on
his way back from Paris now.

12:59.280 --> 13:01.237
If there is something incriminating here...

13:01.400 --> 13:03.756
...he might come back and get it
before we can get a warrant.

13:03.920 --> 13:06.230
Jesus, Keen.
You just got your badge back.

13:06.400 --> 13:08.357
Because of Reddington.

13:08.520 --> 13:10.079
- He needs our help.
- So what?

13:10.240 --> 13:13.119
Just drop everything?
We put off everything to help this guy.

13:13.280 --> 13:15.636
No. It's too much, Keen.
The guy demands too much.

13:15.800 --> 13:18.793
I'm not going in there without a warrant,
and neither should you.

13:46.600 --> 13:48.159
Raymond.

13:52.000 --> 13:54.196
- Elizabeth.
- We found a pop-up safe house...

13:54.360 --> 13:57.000
...used by one of Stone's operatives,
Charles Murphy.

13:57.160 --> 14:00.551
He has dossiers and photographs
of Zack Smoll, your courier...

14:00.720 --> 14:02.951
<i>...and the man you were meeting with.
- Stratos.</i>

14:03.120 --> 14:07.478
Sarantos, yeah, and there's a file
on a woman with the same last name.

14:07.640 --> 14:10.360
Corina Sarantos?
Is that his wife? His sister?

14:10.520 --> 14:13.080
- I have to go.
- Reddington, wait...

14:29.120 --> 14:32.511
Seven or 11.

14:40.000 --> 14:43.072
He just took the sedative.
Cue the wife in 30 seconds.

14:45.760 --> 14:47.877
Raymond, I'm at the tables.

14:48.040 --> 14:50.191
Stratos, listen to me. You're in danger.

14:50.360 --> 14:51.510
I can't hear you.

14:52.800 --> 14:54.120
I gotta hang up.

14:54.280 --> 14:56.636
- Stratos...
- I'll call you right back.

15:06.400 --> 15:07.754
Yes!

15:07.920 --> 15:09.354
You son of a bitch.

15:09.840 --> 15:12.674
- Corina, what are you...?
- You are drunk.

15:12.840 --> 15:15.071
- What the...?
- How dare you? We talked about this.

15:15.240 --> 15:16.594
- What about?
- You. Reddington.

15:16.760 --> 15:19.832
- Lower your voice.
- You should be ashamed of yourself.

15:29.400 --> 15:30.720
What the hell is wrong?

15:30.880 --> 15:33.793
- What did I do?
- Not here.

15:33.960 --> 15:35.633
Don't you dare pick that up.

15:41.800 --> 15:44.110
<i>- Hello?
- Stratos, listen to me. You and Corina...</i>

15:44.280 --> 15:46.954
- ...you're in danger.
- Red? I can't...

15:48.080 --> 15:50.117
<i>Stratos, are you there?</i>

15:50.280 --> 15:52.078
If you can hear me, get out of the hotel.

15:52.800 --> 15:54.120
<i>Stratos.</i>

15:55.280 --> 15:56.873
Stratos.

15:57.040 --> 15:58.997
<i>Are you there?</i>

16:00.600 --> 16:01.795
Let's move.

16:10.160 --> 16:13.119
Perfect.
Although, I do think I wore it better.

16:13.520 --> 16:15.193
On my signal.

16:18.440 --> 16:19.715
Set?

16:21.680 --> 16:23.114
Hotel security, please.

16:23.280 --> 16:26.751
Yeah. The people in the room next door
are having a terrible row.

16:26.960 --> 16:28.440
Hurry. I think he's killing her.

16:36.480 --> 16:40.030
I'm excited.
This is my first time in Monte Carlo.

16:40.200 --> 16:44.160
A lifetime of traveling the world,
and I finally make it to the CÃ´te d'Azur.

16:44.640 --> 16:47.599
My favorite number is 36.
So if we get the chance...

16:47.760 --> 16:52.551
...we're going to the roulette table,
and we're placing a hundred on red 36.

16:53.600 --> 16:55.557
What, you don't like 36?

16:55.720 --> 16:57.518
You don't like red?

16:58.320 --> 16:59.800
Hey.

17:02.720 --> 17:05.359
My brother's going in for surgery.

17:06.200 --> 17:07.429
Oh, God.

17:07.599 --> 17:09.876
Is it serious? What's wrong?

17:10.040 --> 17:12.430
What's wrong is, I'm here in Monaco...

17:12.599 --> 17:15.115
...when my brother's going in for surgery.

17:15.280 --> 17:17.875
I mean, maybe if it was
for the right reason...

17:18.040 --> 17:19.952
...I wouldn't have a problem, but...

17:20.119 --> 17:22.555
...it's not. It's for Reddington.

17:24.319 --> 17:27.676
He might as well sign our checks.
We work for him.

17:27.839 --> 17:30.071
What's wrong with your brother?

17:30.240 --> 17:32.471
It's his heart. They found a blockage.

17:32.640 --> 17:35.280
He's gonna go in
for a bypass in the morning.

17:35.440 --> 17:36.920
I'm sure he'll be fine.

17:37.080 --> 17:40.312
A bypass is very common these days.

17:40.880 --> 17:43.111
It's good they caught it.

17:46.040 --> 17:48.555
- This guy, Stratos, what do we know?
- He was framed.

17:48.720 --> 17:51.110
Judging by the preliminary
crime-scene analysis...

17:51.280 --> 17:54.637
- ...I'd have to disagree.
- I can count the things I envy in this life.

17:54.840 --> 17:58.720
Their relationship was one.
Corina was his soul mate.

17:58.880 --> 18:00.599
I didn't kill my wife.

18:02.400 --> 18:05.234
- Tell me about Raymond Reddington.
- There's nothing to tell.

18:05.400 --> 18:07.517
She didn't like him?
That's why you killed her...

18:07.680 --> 18:09.637
...because she didn't want you working
with Reddington?

18:09.800 --> 18:12.440
- I didn't kill my wife...
- She pushed you...

18:12.600 --> 18:16.560
- No. That was not her.
- ...slapped you, she taunted you in public.

18:16.720 --> 18:19.997
Five minutes later, a witness reported
hearing her scream for her life.

18:20.200 --> 18:23.398
That woman, whoever she was,
she was not Corina.

18:23.560 --> 18:26.758
First, your courier
and the bearer bonds, now Stratos.

18:26.920 --> 18:28.639
<i>- How are they connected?
- They're not.</i>

18:28.800 --> 18:32.032
But those bonds are traceable
back to a shell company I own.

18:33.560 --> 18:36.075
<i>A fact Isabella Stone will use
to my disadvantage.</i>

18:36.240 --> 18:37.515
Nigeria.

18:37.720 --> 18:39.552
Yeah. One week.

18:39.760 --> 18:43.276
Because they need doctors, Albert.
You should come next time.

18:43.440 --> 18:46.274
We have witnesses in the casino,
in the stairwell...

18:46.440 --> 18:48.909
- ...the next room.
- Listen to me. Please, believe me.

18:49.080 --> 18:52.357
When I went back to the room,
Corina was already dead.

18:52.520 --> 18:55.991
- We have your fingerprints on her neck.
- Because they put them there.

18:56.160 --> 18:57.514
Somebody drugged me.

18:57.680 --> 19:00.479
My hands...
They put my hands on her neck.

19:00.640 --> 19:03.678
They did? The people who framed you?

19:03.840 --> 19:06.799
A mild-mannered leasing agent
for cargo ships...

19:07.320 --> 19:10.438
...here to celebrate
your wedding anniversary?

19:12.120 --> 19:13.474
Our 23rd.

19:14.760 --> 19:16.991
Tell me about Raymond Reddington.

19:17.160 --> 19:18.560
<i>How much does Stratos know
about your operations?</i>

19:18.760 --> 19:21.320
I first met Stratos Sarantos
when he was running guns...

19:21.480 --> 19:23.870
...to Cypriot resistance fighters in 1987.

19:24.040 --> 19:26.794
For more than 20 years,
he's overseen my shipping concerns...

19:26.960 --> 19:29.873
...from the Bosphorus to the Suez Canal.
He knows enough.

19:30.040 --> 19:32.714
<i>- So you are afraid he'll talk?
- Stratos is very loyal.</i>

19:32.880 --> 19:35.998
I'm not afraid he'll talk, I'm afraid
of what they'll do when he won't.

19:36.160 --> 19:38.516
You know who they are? FBI.

19:38.680 --> 19:40.034
<i>- Your people are on site?
- Yes.</i>

19:40.240 --> 19:42.471
With all the necessary
extradition documents.

19:42.640 --> 19:45.712
- That won't be enough.
- They want me to give you over.

19:45.880 --> 19:50.159
But you're up on a murder charge,
so you're not going anywhere.

19:50.320 --> 19:53.472
<i>Isabella Stone has linked Stratos to me.
Baited the hook.</i>

19:53.640 --> 19:55.552
Until he helps them reel me in...

19:55.720 --> 19:59.999
...the only place he's going is
a very deep, dark hole.

20:00.160 --> 20:03.153
We've reviewed the hotel security footage
from the corridor.

20:03.320 --> 20:04.800
One way in, one way out.

20:04.960 --> 20:08.590
The only two people to enter this room
in the 27 hours preceding the murder...

20:08.760 --> 20:11.719
...besides the maids,
were Mr. Sarantos and the victim.

20:12.200 --> 20:14.112
- Who found the body?
- Hotel security.

20:14.280 --> 20:17.318
There was a call from a guest complaining
about a loud commotion.

20:17.480 --> 20:19.631
A guest? Is this an adjoining room?

20:19.800 --> 20:22.235
- Yes, Room 21.
- Did you interview them?

20:22.400 --> 20:25.677
Her, no. Unfortunately,
she checked out soon after the incident.

20:25.840 --> 20:27.752
Quite shaken, according to the clerk.

20:27.920 --> 20:29.877
We'll need access to the room.

20:37.840 --> 20:39.559
So much for "one way in."

20:39.720 --> 20:42.633
All right, the hotel takes photocopies
of every guest passport.

20:42.840 --> 20:45.674
This is the person registered in Room 21
the day of the murder.

20:45.840 --> 20:47.479
- Hallie Johnson?
- Oh, no. It's a fake.

20:47.680 --> 20:51.117
A very good one, but FACE Facial
Recognition gave us another hit.

20:51.280 --> 20:54.034
- Her name is Charlotte Hart.
- Did you find a connection...

20:54.200 --> 20:57.910
- ...between her and Murphy?
- They both worked for this woman.

20:58.080 --> 21:00.993
Murphy as a private investigator,
and Hart as an event planner.

21:01.160 --> 21:03.629
Isn't that Judith Pruitt,
whose husband was arrested?

21:03.800 --> 21:07.157
Yeah. Gavin Pruitt,
CEO of Pruitt Securities.

21:07.320 --> 21:11.200
One of the first big Wall Street pyramid
schemes to go down in the late '90s.

21:11.360 --> 21:13.795
Pruitt insisted he was innocent,
but in the end...

21:14.000 --> 21:16.071
...he was convicted on 11 felony counts.

21:16.240 --> 21:18.755
Perjury, money-laundering,
securities fraud...

21:18.960 --> 21:21.555
...sentenced to 10 years
at FCI Petersburg.

21:21.960 --> 21:25.749
In the end, he was stabbed to death
by a fellow convict.

21:25.920 --> 21:27.274
What if he was innocent?

21:27.440 --> 21:29.352
Or Judith thought he was innocent?

21:29.520 --> 21:32.718
She stood by him,
through the trial, the sentencing.

21:32.880 --> 21:35.520
- Her support was unflagging.
- Look at the victimology.

21:35.680 --> 21:37.990
Dr. Eric Bannon,
an esteemed cardiologist...

21:38.160 --> 21:40.595
...butchering his patients for fat fees.

21:40.760 --> 21:44.276
Cynthia Brooks,
an international fashion icon...

21:44.440 --> 21:45.920
...exploiting child labor.

21:46.080 --> 21:49.118
- Red Reddington, crime kingpin.
- Powerful, and guilty as sin.

21:49.280 --> 21:50.873
All of them.

21:51.080 --> 21:54.471
What better way for the bereaved wife
of an innocent, powerful man...

21:54.640 --> 21:58.475
Destroyed, humiliated,
imprisoned, and murdered.

21:58.640 --> 22:03.078
What better way for her to strike back than
to inflict the same fate on the guilty?

22:03.240 --> 22:05.880
I've heard
that she's very active around town.

22:06.040 --> 22:08.157
- Political fundraisers, charity events.
- Right.

22:08.320 --> 22:11.119
From what I found, she's been
keeping up social appearances...

22:11.280 --> 22:13.237
...ever since her husband died.

22:13.400 --> 22:17.713
I did some digging on social media
and found this.

22:19.280 --> 22:21.840
Sorry. Not that.

22:22.640 --> 22:24.438
This is it.
According to their event page...

22:24.600 --> 22:27.354
...she is a major donor
and will be at their fundraiser...

22:27.520 --> 22:29.751
...this afternoon
at the Mandarin Oriental Hotel.

23:12.480 --> 23:13.596
Detective Kotchwar?

23:13.960 --> 23:15.838
Nope, he's retired.

23:16.040 --> 23:19.192
Sir, sir. Please, just one minute.

23:20.280 --> 23:23.557
Thirty years ago, you were lead detective
in the disappearance of a boy...

23:23.720 --> 23:26.872
...who vanished from a rental home
in Ocean City.

23:27.040 --> 23:28.633
His name was Christopher Hargrave.

23:31.480 --> 23:32.675
Yeah. He didn't vanish.

23:33.480 --> 23:35.392
Can you tell me what happened?

23:36.720 --> 23:38.552
He died.

23:40.000 --> 23:42.196
Sir, that's not possible.

23:45.600 --> 23:47.796
What makes you think that?

23:48.960 --> 23:51.555
Because I'm Christopher Hargrave.

23:59.600 --> 24:00.716
Monsieur Leroy Bloom?

24:02.120 --> 24:04.919
Twenty-five years in Chicago,
parking on the street...

24:05.080 --> 24:07.436
...and my car gets taken in Monte Carlo.

24:07.600 --> 24:09.592
I'm telling you, my mother used to say:

24:09.800 --> 24:13.111
"A driver's license is nothing
but an invitation to injury and heartache."

24:13.280 --> 24:16.000
- She was agoraphobic...
- Did you see who took your vehicle?

24:16.160 --> 24:19.278
Yes, absolutely I saw them.
They took the damn thing in front of me.

24:19.440 --> 24:21.909
They had the audacity to wave
as they went away.

24:22.080 --> 24:24.515
- A description?
- Well, the one...

24:24.680 --> 24:26.876
The white one had a ponytail.

24:27.040 --> 24:29.794
The other, the black one, very worked out.

24:29.960 --> 24:32.634
He must drink a ton
of those muscle shakes.

24:32.800 --> 24:34.519
- The car?
- Gray Mercedes...

24:34.680 --> 24:37.514
...CLS550...

24:37.680 --> 24:39.797
...license plate...

24:39.960 --> 24:42.316
...B as in "boy"...

24:43.040 --> 24:46.192
- ...A as in "apple"...
- Please, just say the letters.

24:46.360 --> 24:47.396
Right. Okay.

24:47.560 --> 24:52.077
B, A, 2, 0, 4...

24:52.240 --> 24:55.039
...T, R.

24:55.200 --> 24:58.716
God knows where they are now
and what they've done to my car.

24:59.040 --> 25:00.918
Ladies and gentlemen...

25:01.080 --> 25:05.120
...our fundraising efforts have,
once again, exceeded our goals...

25:05.280 --> 25:09.638
...allowing us to continue
to help needy people...

25:09.800 --> 25:12.395
...in every country on Earth.

25:14.800 --> 25:17.520
I now have the distinct pleasure...

25:17.680 --> 25:21.117
...to introduce the man behind
all this good work.

25:21.280 --> 25:23.078
Our chairman...

25:23.240 --> 25:26.358
...Dr. Justin Sperry.

25:30.360 --> 25:31.680
Thank you, Joy.

25:33.240 --> 25:35.835
Good afternoon, friends.

25:36.000 --> 25:37.957
Isn't this a glorious day?

25:38.320 --> 25:41.836
I'm sure you all feel terrific.
You know why?

25:42.320 --> 25:45.916
Because it feels good to do good.

25:49.280 --> 25:51.840
We've saved thousands
and thousands of lives...

25:52.440 --> 25:55.751
...by delivering everything
from basic medical care...

25:55.920 --> 25:57.195
...and immunizations...

25:57.360 --> 26:01.070
...to advanced prosthetics
and sophisticated surgical procedures.

26:02.440 --> 26:04.477
Facial reconstruction...

26:05.040 --> 26:07.111
...spinal fusions.

26:07.280 --> 26:09.556
Right on schedule.

26:17.480 --> 26:20.154
One of the volunteers
for the Sperry Medical Foundation...

26:21.720 --> 26:25.794
...was arrested by Nigerian Customs for
trying to smuggle 22 million in bonds...

26:25.960 --> 26:28.475
...held by one
of Mr. Reddington's shell corporations.

26:28.640 --> 26:30.950
Oh, man. It is all over the news.

26:31.120 --> 26:34.955
<i>"Sources allege that the charity's a front
to bypass inspections...</i>

26:35.120 --> 26:39.433
<i>...and move contraband between borders.
The chairman is Dr. Justin Sperry.</i>

26:39.600 --> 26:42.877
<i>He is the keynote speaker
at today's charity gala."</i>

26:44.240 --> 26:45.799
Excuse me, ladies and gentlemen.

26:46.000 --> 26:48.310
This is part of Stone's campaign
against Reddington.

26:48.480 --> 26:50.199
She's killed others
because they worked for him.

26:50.360 --> 26:53.512
If Sperry does too, discrediting him
may not be all she has planned.

26:53.680 --> 26:55.160
Get a SWAT team. Get to that event.

26:57.320 --> 27:01.030
And he's on the move. It's time.

27:03.360 --> 27:05.750
That's them, 100 percent.

27:05.920 --> 27:09.197
<i>- Ponytail, muscle shake.
- D'accord, Mr. Bloom.</i>

27:09.360 --> 27:12.432
We need your passport for paperwork.
You should have your car right away.

27:12.600 --> 27:14.432
I can't thank you enough...

27:14.600 --> 27:16.831
...and I apologize in advance.

27:18.080 --> 27:20.549
Drop it, please.

27:22.360 --> 27:25.000
And would you do me the courtesy
of sliding it over?

27:27.360 --> 27:29.158
Lovely.

27:29.640 --> 27:30.710
Unlock it.

27:38.840 --> 27:39.876
Reddington.

27:59.600 --> 28:00.875
Stratos.

28:02.320 --> 28:04.994
- I knew you'd come.
- It's time to go, my friend.

28:17.000 --> 28:18.275
Agent Keen, FBI.

28:18.440 --> 28:22.150
Great. You're here to arrest him now?
You're too late, he's gone.

28:22.320 --> 28:25.552
I'm not looking for Dr. Sperry,
I'm looking for this woman, Judith Pruitt.

28:25.760 --> 28:28.070
I don't understand.
Judy was the only nice one.

28:28.240 --> 28:30.391
Everyone else walked out,
some people stormed.

28:30.600 --> 28:33.672
They said horrible things
about Justin after all the good work...

28:33.840 --> 28:35.513
You know where she went?
Did she say?

28:35.680 --> 28:37.672
She's with him. She insisted.

28:37.840 --> 28:40.071
Said he shouldn't be alone
so she followed him.

28:40.280 --> 28:41.760
- He can drive?
- Of course not.

28:41.920 --> 28:45.391
He uses a service. It picks him up
and takes him where he needs to go.

29:20.200 --> 29:22.715
I'm gonna get you out of here.

29:28.360 --> 29:30.158
- I can't make it.
- Yes, you can.

29:30.320 --> 29:33.552
- Red, go. You have to go now.
- No, we're not leaving you here.

29:36.760 --> 29:39.958
We need to move.
He won't survive the escape.

29:40.520 --> 29:43.354
He's right. Red, I won't make it.

29:43.520 --> 29:45.034
Just give me a gun.

29:45.640 --> 29:47.154
It's okay.

29:50.160 --> 29:51.560
We go now, we can make it.

29:51.720 --> 29:53.154
Please, go.

29:53.560 --> 29:55.791
It's okay. Go.

30:01.320 --> 30:02.993
Whatever happens...

30:03.160 --> 30:05.231
...whatever you do...

30:05.400 --> 30:09.519
...just know your children will be
cared for, and your honor is intact.

30:38.800 --> 30:41.190
Raymond, no.

30:47.960 --> 30:50.714
Aram, we're heading to you now.
Where are we on the case?

30:50.880 --> 30:54.715
We have a lead on Stone and the man
we believe to be her next target...

30:54.880 --> 30:58.271
...chairman of the Sperry Medical
Foundation, on their way to his home...

30:58.440 --> 31:00.113
...in Falls Church right now.

31:00.280 --> 31:03.034
- Okay. What did the doctor say?
- Can you text me an address?

31:03.200 --> 31:05.669
Sending now,
with satellite imagery of the property.

31:05.880 --> 31:09.874
- Keen and the team are en route.
- All right. Well, call me when he gets out.

31:10.040 --> 31:11.474
<i>- Have you called ahead?
- Yes.</i>

31:11.680 --> 31:14.036
Oh, and Sperry's a paraplegic
with a live-in nurse.

31:14.200 --> 31:16.874
I tried calling a bunch of times,
but no one's picking up.

31:17.040 --> 31:18.633
Keep trying. What's her name?

31:18.800 --> 31:21.793
- Gretchen. Gretchen!
- I don't think she's in any condition...

31:21.960 --> 31:24.475
...to hear you now.
She has quite the drinking problem.

31:24.640 --> 31:26.597
My friend Mr. Murphy took the liberty...

31:26.760 --> 31:28.717
...of letting himself in
when she was at the cleaners...

31:28.880 --> 31:31.349
...picking up your suit.
Slipped something into her brandy.

31:31.520 --> 31:33.557
I don't understand.
What do you people want?

31:33.720 --> 31:36.394
Nothing that's not well within
your skill set, Dr. Sperry.

31:36.560 --> 31:38.517
All we want is for you to tell the truth.

31:38.680 --> 31:40.114
Charlotte.

31:47.040 --> 31:49.430
<i>I told you, we'd handle Stratos.</i>

31:49.600 --> 31:50.920
Yes, but you failed.

31:51.080 --> 31:53.231
<i>Breaking him out was never
our intention.</i>

31:53.400 --> 31:55.312
I did what I felt was necessary.

31:55.480 --> 31:58.712
And now he's dead, a man you said
would do anything to protect you.

32:01.760 --> 32:04.275
- Isabella Stone.
- She used the bonds to expose...

32:04.480 --> 32:06.517
...your involvement
in the Sperry Foundation.

32:07.120 --> 32:09.316
<i>- I'm told you have a location.
- Correct.</i>

32:09.480 --> 32:11.358
Keen, Ressler and Navabi are in pursuit.

32:11.880 --> 32:14.270
I need to speak with her
the moment she's detained.

32:14.440 --> 32:15.954
Oh, that's not gonna happen.

32:17.760 --> 32:19.274
I wasn't asking permission.

32:19.440 --> 32:21.511
Hey, I stood by you.

32:21.680 --> 32:23.956
Signed off on cases
that are personal to you.

32:24.120 --> 32:25.236
I have done that.

32:25.400 --> 32:29.110
Over the objections of both agents
I respect and superiors I answer to.

32:29.280 --> 32:31.795
<i>So before you start telling me
what it is you want...</i>

32:42.360 --> 32:44.875
Maybe we shouldn't have gone there,
Raymond.

32:46.160 --> 32:50.154
You keep putting yourself in more
and more danger every year.

32:50.360 --> 32:52.431
Every day.

32:53.920 --> 32:56.560
And people are dying all around you.

33:00.760 --> 33:03.594
I don't know how to respond to that.

33:11.080 --> 33:13.276
I'm not going to read this.
This is nonsense.

33:13.440 --> 33:16.672
Is it? Because my source was
quite certain...

33:16.840 --> 33:19.912
...that Reddington has donated millions
to your foundation.

33:20.080 --> 33:21.799
- You have no proof.
- But we do.

33:22.200 --> 33:26.592
Our sources provided us with a boringly
large number of financial documents...

33:26.760 --> 33:29.958
...detailing wire transfers
between Reddington's shell companies...

33:30.120 --> 33:31.998
...and the Sperry Medical Foundation.

33:32.160 --> 33:34.391
The rest? This allegation
that we've acted as...

33:34.560 --> 33:38.236
...some sort of personal courier for him
to move contraband?

33:38.400 --> 33:40.312
That's a disgusting lie.

33:40.480 --> 33:44.315
And you know as well as I do, those bonds
were planted in my doctor's suitcase.

33:44.480 --> 33:46.278
Which is why I am so glad...

33:46.440 --> 33:49.877
...that I can count
on people buying into appearances.

33:50.040 --> 33:51.190
Cubic zirconia.

33:51.360 --> 33:54.159
But the bonds,
they're just not damning enough.

33:54.320 --> 33:56.789
- I still need your cooperation.
- Forget it. I won't.

33:56.960 --> 33:59.873
Oh, you will.
And I urge you to be convincing.

34:00.040 --> 34:03.272
After all, your life depends on it.

34:03.440 --> 34:07.150
To enter the water strapped
into that wheelchair...

34:07.320 --> 34:10.870
...the last tragic act of a desperate man,
his charity exposed...

34:11.040 --> 34:15.556
...as part of an underground
shipping cartel for a notorious criminal...

34:16.400 --> 34:17.719
Nobody's gonna believe this.

34:17.880 --> 34:20.235
Oh, I think they will.

34:20.400 --> 34:22.630
Trust me, Dr. Sperry...

34:22.800 --> 34:26.396
...no matter how sterling your reputation,
people will believe...

34:26.560 --> 34:28.040
...the most awful things.

34:28.199 --> 34:30.271
No, no. All right, all right, all right.

34:30.440 --> 34:33.989
Glad we're on the same page.
Let's get started.

34:36.400 --> 34:38.437
Ladies and gentlemen...

34:38.840 --> 34:40.353
...those of you kind enough...

34:40.520 --> 34:42.512
<i>...to support
the Sperry Medical Foundation...</i>

34:42.719 --> 34:46.110
...with your contributions, especially
the brave and skilled physicians...

34:46.280 --> 34:49.114
...who have selflessly volunteered
their services...

34:49.280 --> 34:52.398
...I owe you all a heartfelt apology
and a confession.

34:52.560 --> 34:55.393
For decades, I've not only
accepted millions of dollars...

34:55.560 --> 34:59.713
...from Raymond Reddington, a known
criminal, but subverted our mission...

34:59.880 --> 35:02.679
...using our access
to various host-nations.

35:04.080 --> 35:05.275
Help! Help!

35:07.120 --> 35:10.796
- FBI! Hands, let me see your hands!
- FBI!

35:16.240 --> 35:18.596
Over your head now!

35:55.320 --> 35:58.836
<i>25-17, stand by.
Additional traffic control.</i>

36:02.040 --> 36:03.235
<i>Who are you working for?</i>

36:03.400 --> 36:06.677
Who contracted you to go after
the people working for Reddington?

36:06.840 --> 36:08.718
You should be thanking me.

36:08.880 --> 36:11.679
- For what?
- For targeting him.

36:11.840 --> 36:13.991
- Hurting him.
- The name.

36:14.640 --> 36:18.520
Unless I'm mistaken,
Reddington is on your Most Wanted list.

36:18.680 --> 36:21.275
And to get him,
we need to get the people close to him.

36:21.440 --> 36:24.035
The person who hired you knows
who those people are.

36:24.240 --> 36:27.119
See, you wanna hurt Reddington,
we wanna capture him.

36:27.280 --> 36:29.397
Seems like we both want
the same things.

36:29.560 --> 36:31.392
I can assure you, we do not.

36:31.960 --> 36:34.111
Well, you're looking at life in prison.

36:34.280 --> 36:36.840
So maybe you can help us,
and we can help you.

36:37.000 --> 36:38.832
Oh, I can help you...

36:39.360 --> 36:41.477
...but I'm never gonna do that.

36:46.000 --> 36:48.469
I was relieved to hear about Justin.

36:48.880 --> 36:50.837
He's a good man.

36:51.240 --> 36:53.436
Is there any truth to Stone's allegations?

36:54.080 --> 36:58.438
Only insofar as I've made
substantial anonymous contributions...

36:58.600 --> 37:00.637
...to his foundation.

37:00.800 --> 37:05.079
But there have never been
any strings attached.

37:05.640 --> 37:07.791
I consider Justin to be a saint.

37:07.960 --> 37:11.431
Or as close to a saint
as one can be in this world.

37:11.600 --> 37:13.159
You know him?

37:13.320 --> 37:16.279
I met him a decade ago in West Africa.

37:17.000 --> 37:21.358
The WHO and the Gabonese
Ministry of Health had declared...

37:21.520 --> 37:24.877
...a hemorrhagic fever outbreak
in the OoguÃ©-Ivindo province.

37:25.520 --> 37:27.910
I happened to be in the area,
transporting...

37:29.240 --> 37:31.596
...materials to the Congolese border...

37:31.760 --> 37:35.470
...when we ran
into an improvised roadblock...

37:35.640 --> 37:37.916
...of broken crates and rusty barrels.

37:38.080 --> 37:42.199
I ordered my men to clear the road
when out steps this young skinny kid...

37:42.400 --> 37:45.472
...fresh out of Harvard Medical School.

37:46.440 --> 37:49.990
Justin hadn't yet lost
the use of his limbs.

37:50.440 --> 37:53.592
Although, even then, he was...

37:53.760 --> 37:58.471
...showing early signs of the ALS
that would eventually claim his mobility.

37:59.480 --> 38:02.678
But he was fearless. A lion.

38:02.880 --> 38:05.998
He demanded
to commandeer our convoy...

38:06.160 --> 38:09.949
...in order to transport refugees to Ekata.

38:10.360 --> 38:11.714
He was unarmed.

38:11.880 --> 38:13.314
I had a security detail...

38:13.520 --> 38:17.150
...of a dozen international,
battle-hardened mercenaries.

38:17.320 --> 38:18.436
What did you do?

38:18.600 --> 38:22.150
In the face of that kind of will...

38:22.760 --> 38:26.276
...I reorganized my cargo
and complied with his demands.

38:27.320 --> 38:30.119
What progress have you made
with Isabella Stone?

38:30.280 --> 38:31.919
None. She won't cooperate.

38:32.120 --> 38:34.715
If someone hired her to come after you,
she won't say who.

38:34.880 --> 38:36.712
The truth will out, it always does.

38:36.880 --> 38:39.270
- What is this?
- For Agnes.

38:45.320 --> 38:47.073
It's beautiful.

38:48.040 --> 38:51.716
You'll find your time with her
goes by too quickly.

38:52.200 --> 38:53.953
That's why cuckoo clocks are perfect.

38:54.920 --> 38:57.879
I don't really care what time it is.

38:58.040 --> 39:00.839
I just wanna hear the bird sing.

39:36.720 --> 39:38.359
Your brother...

39:42.440 --> 39:44.113
He's fine.

39:44.280 --> 39:46.431
But he might not have been.

39:46.840 --> 39:47.990
I should've been there.

39:48.160 --> 39:49.879
You were working.

39:50.040 --> 39:53.238
Whether Reddington is involved or not,
it's your job.

39:55.320 --> 39:57.152
He's my brother.

39:59.040 --> 40:00.759
I should've been there.

40:48.000 --> 40:51.550
<i>When I went into his room,
there was a little light on.</i>

40:51.760 --> 40:54.434
<i>Like a night-light,
enough to get around.</i>

40:54.600 --> 40:57.513
<i>- And you had a knife at that time?
- Yeah.</i>

40:58.000 --> 41:01.277
<i>When I came in through the kitchen,
there was a thing there.</i>

41:01.440 --> 41:04.512
<i>Holds knives. By the oven.</i>

41:04.880 --> 41:07.554
<i>- I grabbed one.
- Did you put the knife in your pocket?</i>

41:07.720 --> 41:08.870
<i>Yeah.</i>

41:09.040 --> 41:10.315
<i>Didn't need it.</i>

41:10.480 --> 41:14.315
<i>When I walked up to him,
he was sleeping there.</i>

41:14.880 --> 41:16.553
<i>Like a doll or something.</i>

41:17.760 --> 41:20.719
Hey, babe. You know,
I was thinking about your dad...

41:20.880 --> 41:23.349
...and you're right.
We should just let it lie.

41:23.520 --> 41:26.911
I don't think that there's any reason
for us to look into your past.

41:31.120 --> 41:32.918
Yeah. About that...

41:36.680 --> 41:39.275
Honey, these are police reports.

41:39.960 --> 41:42.031
What do those have to do with your dad?

41:42.200 --> 41:44.157
They don't. They're about me.

41:45.800 --> 41:48.838
- Who's that?
- That's Richard Game.

41:49.000 --> 41:50.434
The man who murdered me.

41:51.080 --> 41:53.549
<i>When I picked him up, he sort of...</i>

41:53.720 --> 41:55.632
<i>...looked at me a minute.</i>

41:55.800 --> 41:57.234
<i>Like maybe he knew me.</i>

41:58.520 --> 42:00.591
<i>Then he started slapping...</i>

42:00.760 --> 42:02.831
<i>...or hitting.</i>

42:03.040 --> 42:05.509
<i>So I put my hand over his mouth.</i>

42:07.200 --> 42:09.431
<i>Guess he was trying to fight.</i>

42:27.880 --> 42:30.634
Isabella, we have much to talk about.
