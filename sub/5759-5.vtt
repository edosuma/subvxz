WEBVTT

00:01.100 --> 00:02.021
PREVIOUSLY ON
PREI IY LI'I'I'LE LIARS...
EMILY.

00:03.570 --> 00:04.969
DR. VARGAS CALLED.
HE WANTED TO KNOW

00:05.000 --> 00:08.629
IF I'D EVER GIVEN YOU
ANY OF THE HYDROCODONE
I WAS PRESCRIBED LAST YEAR.

00:08.670 --> 00:10.763
LET'S GO. GET IN THE CAR.
LET GO OF MY ARM!

00:10.810 --> 00:14.337
Spencer: I HEARD FROM UPenn
THIS MORNING. I DIDN'T GET IN.

00:15.810 --> 00:17.778
WERE YOU IN NEW YORK
THE WHOLE TIME YOU WERE GONE?

00:17.810 --> 00:19.812
OF COURSE.
WHERE ELSE WOULD I BE?

00:19.850 --> 00:21.511
Tom: SHE CALLED ME,
CAME OVER.

00:21.550 --> 00:24.314
I KEEP A GUN LOCKED IN MY DESK.
IT'S MISSING.

00:24.350 --> 00:26.181
I GAVE THE RV TO "A"
FOR NOTHING.

00:26.220 --> 00:27.778
I THINK "A"
GAVE YOU SOMETHING REAL.

00:27.820 --> 00:29.253
GOTTA FIND DR. PALMER.

00:29.290 --> 00:31.451
VIENNA.
WOULD YOU LIKE TO COME WITH ME?

00:31.490 --> 00:34.095
THIS WAS FROM THE STUDIO
THAT ALI WENT TO?

00:34.130 --> 00:36.724
HE COPIED YOUR SISTER'S FACE
JUST LIKE HE DID ALISON'S.

00:36.770 --> 00:37.998
HOW MANY OF THOSE MASKS
DID YOU MAKE?

00:38.030 --> 00:40.533
I'LL TELL YOU WHAT I KNOW,
AND YOU GIVE ME SOMETHING
IN RETURN.

00:40.570 --> 00:42.401
WHAT DO YOU WANT?
YOUR FACE.

00:42.440 --> 00:45.534
YOU LIED TO ME.
I DO NOT HAVE TO ACCOUNT
FOR MYSELF TO YOU.

00:45.570 --> 00:48.175
YOU TOLD THE EMT
YOU FELL OFF YOUR BIKE.
THAT'S WHAT HAPPENED.

00:49.180 --> 00:50.249
( all scream )

00:50.280 --> 00:51.770
AAAH! AAH!

00:51.810 --> 00:54.074
FAMILY SERVICES CALLED.
THEY WANT TO INTERVIEW ME.

00:54.120 --> 00:56.315
ABOUT WHAT?
SOMETHING THOUGHT I WAS
A BIT EXCESSIVE WITH YOU

00:56.350 --> 00:58.181
OUTSIDE THE SCHOOL.

01:13.500 --> 01:14.797
THAN KS.

01:17.610 --> 01:18.838
HELLO, EM.

01:21.910 --> 01:24.242
DON'T BE LATE
FOR SCHOOL, HUH?

01:40.630 --> 01:43.224
( bell rings )

01:43.270 --> 01:45.864
OKAY, SO HE THINKS
MY MOM STOLE THE GUN?

01:45.900 --> 01:47.765
YOUR DAD'S NOT SURE, OKAY?

01:47.800 --> 01:49.631
IT COULD HAVE BEEN MISSING
BEFORE SHE GOT THERE.

01:49.670 --> 01:51.399
HE JUST KNOWS IT WAS GONE
AFTER SHE LEFI'.

01:51.440 --> 01:53.738
NO. IT'S NOT POSSIBLE.
IT'S BEYOND POSSIBLE.

01:53.780 --> 01:55.429
IT'S WHAT HAPPENED.

01:55.480 --> 01:58.176
HANNA, YOUR DAD
OWNED A .38.

01:58.210 --> 02:00.269
IF IT TURNS OUT THAT
WILDEN WAS SHOT WITH A .38,

02:00.320 --> 02:03.187
YOUR MOM HAS
A LOT MORE TO EXPLAIN
THAN NOT HAVING AN ALIBI.

02:03.220 --> 02:04.482
IS THIS WHAT
YOU CALL HELPING?

02:04.520 --> 02:06.351
AS A MATTER OF FACT,
YES.

02:06.390 --> 02:07.482
WELL, IT'S NOT.

02:07.520 --> 02:09.886
HEY, HANNA. IF THIS
LOOKS BAD TO US,

02:09.930 --> 02:11.750
HOW DO YOU THINK
IT'S GONNA LOOK
TO THOSE STATE COPS?

02:11.790 --> 02:13.621
JUST FORGET IT, OKAY?!
FORGET WHAT?

02:13.660 --> 02:15.525
FORGET THE GUN,
FORGET YOU SPOKE TO MY FATHER,

02:15.560 --> 02:17.221
JUST FORGET EVERYTHING
YOU EVER TOLD ME!

02:17.270 --> 02:19.636
HANNA, FORGETTING
IS NOT GONNA WORK
IN THIS SITUATION.

02:19.670 --> 02:22.332
JUST...DON'T DO ANYTHING, OKAY?

02:25.410 --> 02:26.536
SPENCE.

02:26.580 --> 02:28.229
DID YOU SHOW YOUR SISTER
THE MASK YET?

02:28.280 --> 02:30.248
MORNING, HANNA.
HI. DID YOU?

02:30.280 --> 02:32.248
NOT YET.
WHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR?

02:32.280 --> 02:35.374
WE CAN'T JUST LET HER
GET AWAY WITH IT BECAUSE
SHE'S YOUR SISTER, SPENCER.

02:35.420 --> 02:36.819
WHOA!
TAKE IT DOWN A NOTCH.

02:36.850 --> 02:38.784
THAT MASK PUTS MELISSA
AT THE STUDIO.

02:38.820 --> 02:41.254
RIGHT NOW THAT ALL IT DOES.
SHE'S LEAVING TOWN--

02:41.290 --> 02:43.781
AND SHE'S ABOUT TO
PIN IT ON MY MOM
BEFORE SHE GOES.

02:43.830 --> 02:45.388
IF SHE'S "A."

02:45.430 --> 02:47.318
SHE HAS TO BE!
Emily: GUYS--

02:47.360 --> 02:49.521
EMILY, PLEASE TELL THEM.
WE HAVE TO DO SOMETHING.

02:49.570 --> 02:51.322
YOU OKAY?
MY DAD'S HOME.

02:51.370 --> 02:53.235
ISN'T THAT USUALLY
A GOOD THING?

02:53.270 --> 02:57.229
NO. HE'S BACK BECAUSE
FAMILY SERVICES
WANTS TO TALK TO US.

02:59.510 --> 03:03.298
Linda: THOSE ARE THE ONES
YOU TOLD ME ABOUT?
Gabe: THAT'S THEM.

03:03.350 --> 03:05.705
IF I DRESSED LIKE THAT
WHEN I WAS IN HIGH SCHOOL,

03:05.750 --> 03:07.547
MY DAD WOULDA HAD A STROKE.

03:09.020 --> 03:10.783
I COULDA
GO'I'TEN USED TO IT.

03:10.820 --> 03:13.380
DON'T MAKE ME SORRY
I PICKED YOU FOR THIS.

03:13.420 --> 03:15.684
WE'RE NOT HERE
TO GET COZY.

03:15.720 --> 03:18.689
I KNOW. WE'RE HERE
TO SOLVE A COUPLE OF HOMICIDES

03:18.730 --> 03:20.391
THE LOCALS
KEEP TRIPPING OVER.

03:20.430 --> 03:23.627
AND FIND OUT WHAT IT IS
ABOUT THOSE FOUR PRETTY GIRLS

03:23.670 --> 03:25.797
THAT ATTRACT S
SO MANY CORPSES.

03:25.830 --> 03:27.730
( bell rings )

03:29.470 --> 03:32.303
* GOT A SECRET,
CAN YOU KEEP IT *

03:32.340 --> 03:34.729
* SWEAR THIS ONE
YOU'LL SAVE *

03:34.780 --> 03:37.248
* BETTER LOCK IT
IN YOUR POCKET *

03:37.280 --> 03:39.771
* TAKING THIS ONE
TO THE GRAVE *

03:39.820 --> 03:44.712
* IF I SHOW YOU THEN I'LL KNOW
YOU WON'T TELL WHAT I SAID *

03:44.750 --> 03:47.287
* 'CAUSE TWO CAN
KEEP A SECRET *

03:51.630 --> 03:52.619
WHAT IF HECTOR REALIZES
MELISSA'S MASK IS MISSING?

03:54.830 --> 03:57.663
THAT GUY HAS SO MANY HEADS
HE'LL NEVER MISS ONE.

03:57.700 --> 03:59.531
I THINK I HAVE TO
WRITE THAT SENTENCE DOWN.

03:59.570 --> 04:01.765
( phone chimes )

04:01.800 --> 04:03.768
IT'S MY DAD.

04:03.810 --> 04:06.005
HE WANTS ME TO COME
STRAIGHT HOME AFTER SCHOOL.

04:06.040 --> 04:08.736
COME ON, THEY CAN'T REALLY
THINK THAT THERE'S SOMETHING
WRONG WITH YOUR FAMILY.

04:08.780 --> 04:09.872
I DON'T KNOW WHAT THEY THINK.

04:09.910 --> 04:12.003
I LIED ABOUT GETTING HURT,
I LIED ABOUT THE PILLS...

04:12.050 --> 04:13.745
LITTLE LIES.
Hanna: THAT'S THE PROBLEM.

04:13.780 --> 04:15.839
A BIG LIE GIVES YOU
SOMETHING TO HANG ONTO.

04:15.880 --> 04:17.689
THE TROUBLE STARTS
WHEN YOU SHAVE THE TRUTH

04:17.720 --> 04:19.859
AND IT JUST GETS
ALL TWISTED UP.

04:21.390 --> 04:23.324
ALL RIGHT, I GOTTA GO.

04:23.360 --> 04:24.827
HEY, HOW'S JAKE?

04:24.860 --> 04:26.794
JAKE'S FINE.

04:26.830 --> 04:29.469
HE WAS "FINE"
THE LAST TIME WE ASKED.

04:29.500 --> 04:31.320
WELL, HE'S STILL FINE.

04:32.800 --> 04:35.462
IS YOUR MOM
REALLY GOING TO AUSTRIA
WITH THAT MUFFIN MAN?

04:35.500 --> 04:37.365
I THINK SO.

04:37.410 --> 04:38.900
AUSTRIA'S A LONG WAY FROM HERE.

04:38.940 --> 04:41.033
I'M COUNTING ON "A"
NOT HAVING A PASSPORT.

04:41.080 --> 04:43.344
( bell rings )

04:43.380 --> 04:45.575
HEY, SPENCE. FIGURE OUT
WHAT YOU WANT TO DO
ABOUT MELISSA.

04:49.850 --> 04:52.956
SENIOR YEAR'S SUPPOSED TO BE
THE BEST YEAR OF YOUR LIFE.
DID YOU KNOW THAT?

04:52.990 --> 04:54.981
YEAH, IF YOU SURVIVE IT.

04:59.900 --> 05:02.050
I THINK YOU WERE
REALLY SMART ABOUT THE COAT.

05:02.100 --> 05:04.318
IT WAS MORE THAN
I WANTED TO SPEND,

05:04.370 --> 05:05.723
BUT I THOUGHT THE WEATHER
IN SAN FRANCISCO,

05:05.770 --> 05:07.658
THE WEATHER IN LONDON--
I COULD USE IT EITHER PLACE.

05:07.700 --> 05:10.362
EXACTLY. ARE YOU TAKING
YOUR OTHER TRENCH COAT?

05:10.410 --> 05:12.435
I DON'T THINK SO.
WELL, SPENCER COULD USE IT.

05:12.480 --> 05:15.074
YOU LIKE MELISSA'S COAT,
THE ONE WITH THE NEW BELT.

05:15.110 --> 05:16.702
YOU'D WEAR THAT,
WOULDN'T YOU?

05:16.750 --> 05:18.775
IT WOULD BE AN HONOR
AND A PRIVILEGE.

05:21.620 --> 05:23.884
SPENCER,
DON'T BE LIKE THAT.

05:23.920 --> 05:25.740
LIKE WHAT?

05:25.790 --> 05:28.088
JEALOUS OF YOUR SISTER.
I'M NOT JEALOUS.

05:28.120 --> 05:30.680
MOM.
THIS IS A WONDERFUL
OPPORTUNITY FOR HER.

05:30.730 --> 05:32.083
SHE'S WORKED
REALLY HARD.

05:32.130 --> 05:34.690
THINGS HAVE NOT BEEN EASY
FOR ANY OF US.

05:34.730 --> 05:37.392
WE SHOULD BE HAPPY FOR HER
AFTER ALL THAT'S HAPPENED.

05:37.430 --> 05:39.569
IT'S ALL RIGHT.
I UNDERSTAND.

05:39.600 --> 05:42.433
IF I WERE HER, I WOULD
FEEL THE SAME WAY.

05:42.470 --> 05:44.062
WOULD YOU?

05:44.110 --> 05:46.578
YOU'RE GONNA MISS
SHARING THINGS WITH
YOUR SISTER.

05:46.610 --> 05:48.669
GRADUATION,
GOING TO UPenn--

05:48.710 --> 05:50.541
UH, NOBODY'S
GONNA MISS THAT.

05:50.580 --> 05:52.468
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

05:52.520 --> 05:56.547
UPenn. I'M NOT
GOING TO UPenn.

05:56.590 --> 05:59.047
OF COURSE YOU ARE.
OF COURSE I'M NOT.

05:59.090 --> 06:00.853
I GOT MY REJECT ION LETTER.

06:00.890 --> 06:02.585
SPENCER,
THIS ISN'T FUNNY.

06:02.630 --> 06:05.087
OKAY, WELL, I THINK
IT'S A SCREAM.

06:05.130 --> 06:07.724
I-I DON'T THINK
SHE'S JOKING, MOM.

06:07.760 --> 06:09.728
YOU'RE SO SMART.
PLEASE EXPLAIN IT TO HER.

06:09.770 --> 06:12.591
NO, YOU EXPLAIN IT
TO ME.

06:12.640 --> 06:14.767
OKAY, THEY REJECT ED ME,

06:14.800 --> 06:17.735
AND WHEREVER I GO
AFTER GRADUATION,

06:17.770 --> 06:20.102
IT WILL NOT BE TO
THE FAMILY ALMA MATER.

06:20.140 --> 06:22.108
THAT'S EARLY ADMISSION.
THERE ARE THINGS WE CAN DO.

06:22.140 --> 06:23.869
"WE" ARE NOT
GONNA DO ANYTHING.

06:23.910 --> 06:26.447
STOP IT. LISTEN TO YOUR SISTER.
SHE'S TRYING TO HELP YOU.

06:26.480 --> 06:28.175
I'M NOT SO SURE
SPENCER WANTS MY HELP.

06:28.220 --> 06:30.518
OF COURSE SHE DOES.
DON'T YOU, SPENCER?

06:33.720 --> 06:35.756
YEAH.

06:35.790 --> 06:38.782
MAYBE THERE ARE A FEW THINGS
I COULD LEARN FROM HER.

06:49.200 --> 06:50.758
MOM?

06:58.910 --> 07:00.616
( door closes )

07:01.920 --> 07:03.547
( clears throat )

07:03.590 --> 07:05.512
OH. HELLO, HANNA.

07:05.550 --> 07:07.689
OFFICER HOLBROOK.

07:10.190 --> 07:12.750
I MET HIM AT
WILDEN'S FUNERAL.

07:13.800 --> 07:15.950
THIS IS MY PARTNER,
LIEUTENANT TANNER.

07:16.000 --> 07:18.491
HANNA MARIN.
HELLO, HANNA.

07:20.640 --> 07:21.868
HELLO.

07:23.140 --> 07:24.801
HANNA, I'LL CALL YOU.
OH, THAT'S ALL RIGHT,

07:24.840 --> 07:27.707
SHE CAN STAY. THIS ISN'T
GONNA TAKE LONG.

07:27.740 --> 07:30.447
WHOSE BOX IS THAT?
DARREN WILDEN'S.

07:32.250 --> 07:35.014
Linda: OH, NICE NEST EGG.

07:37.720 --> 07:41.087
THE BANK DISCOURAGES DEPOSITORS
FROM KEEPING CASH IN THEIR
SAFE DEPOSIT BOXES.

07:41.120 --> 07:43.680
THAT'S A GOOD POLICY.

07:43.730 --> 07:45.220
TWO PASSPORTS.

07:45.260 --> 07:48.752
ONE AMERICAN,
AND ONE CANADIAN.

07:48.800 --> 07:50.529
MM-HMM.

07:53.000 --> 07:54.490
HMM...

07:56.710 --> 07:59.975
YOU SHOULD WARN YOUR CUSTOMERS
ABOUT KEEPING FIREARMS, TOO.

08:00.010 --> 08:01.705
YOU THINK
THAT'S HIS DROP GUN?

08:01.740 --> 08:03.970
LET'S NOT SPEAK ILL
OF THE DEAD, GABRIEL,

08:04.010 --> 08:06.740
BUT THE SERIAL NUMBER'S
BEEN FILED OFF.

08:09.050 --> 08:11.587
SO WOULD YOU HAVE BEEN THE ONE
TO TAKE WILDEN INTO THE VAULT?

08:11.620 --> 08:14.851
UH, IF I WAS HERE, YES.

08:14.890 --> 08:17.552
SO AS FAR AS YOU KNOW,
NO BANK EMPLOYEE

08:17.590 --> 08:20.252
HAS EVER SEEN
THE CONTENTS OF THIS BOX?

08:20.300 --> 08:21.858
THAT'S RIGHT.

08:21.900 --> 08:23.060
EXCEPT FOR YOU.

08:29.570 --> 08:31.208
I MEAN, JUST NOW...

08:31.240 --> 08:32.730
WHEN HE OPENED IT.

08:33.910 --> 08:36.708
YES, THAT WOULD BE
THE FIRST TIME.

08:38.780 --> 08:40.919
TAKE EVERYTHING,
INCLUDING THE BOX.

08:42.890 --> 08:44.983
WOULD YOU MIND
IF I HAVE A BUTTERSCOTCH?

08:45.020 --> 08:46.851
PLEASE.

09:00.040 --> 09:03.305
Spencer (over phone):
LOOK, I UNDERSTAND THAT
HANNA'S WORRIED ABOUT HER MOM,

09:03.340 --> 09:07.128
BUT I WANT TO FIND OUT
WHAT MELISSA'S DOING JUST
AS MUCH AS SHE DOES. MORE.

09:07.180 --> 09:09.978
WE HAVE TO KNOW
WHAT SHE WAS DOING
WITH JENNA AND SHANA.

09:10.010 --> 09:13.116
MELISSA'S NOT GONNA
TELL US ANYTHING.
WE NEED SOME LEVERAGE.

09:13.150 --> 09:17.917
( door closes,
muffled voices in distance )

09:17.950 --> 09:21.909
WHAT KIND OF LEVERAGE?
HER MASK.

09:21.960 --> 09:24.326
IF WE CAN BLINDSIDE HER IT,
MAYBE CAN SHAKE SOME REAL
ANSWERS OUT OF HER.

09:24.360 --> 09:28.319
Wayne: I'M JUST TRYING TO
UNDERSTAND WHAT HAPPENED HERE.

09:28.360 --> 09:30.669
LISTEN, I GOTTA GO.
OKAY.

09:30.700 --> 09:32.190
WE'LL COME UP WITH
SOMETHING TOMORROW.

09:32.230 --> 09:33.959
'NIGHT.
NIGHT.

09:36.710 --> 09:40.202
Wayne: HE TELLS ME
SOCIAL SERVICES IS ASKING
QUESTIONS ABOUT MY FAMILY.

09:40.240 --> 09:44.745
THE LOOK ON HIS FACE...
Pam: I KNOW. I'VE SEEN THAT LOOK
FROM PEOPLE IN TOWN.

09:44.780 --> 09:47.169
WE'LL DEAL WITH THAT.
THERE'S NOTHING
TO FEEL ASHAMED OF,

09:47.220 --> 09:50.678
BUT WHEN YOU SEE THAT LOOK--

09:50.720 --> 09:52.756
I KNOW.
WE'LL DEAL WITH THAT.

09:52.790 --> 09:55.213
IT'S JUST GOSSIP.

09:55.260 --> 09:57.285
I'M WORRIED ABOUT EMMY.

09:57.330 --> 09:59.958
YOU REALIZE
SHE'S LYING TO US.

10:06.770 --> 10:08.032
I THINK YOU GOT
A REALLY WRONG IMPRESSION
OF ME FROM THE OTHER DAY.

10:09.300 --> 10:11.359
REALLY?
YES. NOT YOUR FAULT,

10:11.410 --> 10:14.777
NOBODY'S FAULT,
BUT SOMETIMES YOU SAY
SOMETHING THE WRONG WAY

10:14.810 --> 10:16.949
OR IT COMES OUT WRONG,
AND THE PERSON YOU'RE
TALKING TO,

10:16.980 --> 10:19.642
THEY THINK THERE'S SOMETHING
GOING ON WHEN THERE ISN'T.

10:19.680 --> 10:21.944
WHAT'S THE PROBLEM,
EMILY?
NOTHING'S THE PROBLEM.

10:21.980 --> 10:25.108
THAT'S THE POINT. BUT...

10:25.150 --> 10:28.153
DID YOU TALK TO
FAMILY SERVICES ABOUT ME?

10:28.190 --> 10:29.259
YES.

10:29.290 --> 10:30.382
WELL, YOU SHOULDN'T
HAVE DONE THAT.

10:30.430 --> 10:31.886
I MEAN, I CAN
EXPLAIN EVERYTHING.

10:31.930 --> 10:35.093
YOU HAVE TO CALL THEM BACK
AND TELL THEM THAT THERE'S
NOTHING TO WORRY ABOUT.

10:35.130 --> 10:38.964
EMILY, DID SOMEONE
PRESSURE YOU TO COME IN
AND TALK TO ME THIS MORNING?

10:39.000 --> 10:42.128
WHAT? NO, I JUST WANT
TO STRAIGHT THIS OUT.

10:42.170 --> 10:44.866
THIS IS A SAFE PLACE.
YOU CAN TELL ME THE TRUTH HERE.

10:44.910 --> 10:47.128
I AM TELLING YOU
THE TRUTH.

10:47.180 --> 10:49.136
OKAY, JUST FORGET I WAS HERE.

10:49.180 --> 10:50.738
EMILY, WAIT.

10:50.780 --> 10:52.771
I WAS GONNA
CALL YOU TODAY.

10:52.820 --> 10:55.072
I HEARD BACK ON
YOUR X-RAY CONSULT.

10:55.120 --> 10:56.439
MY X-RAY.

10:56.480 --> 11:00.314
THE MRI CONFIRMED
A PARTIAL TEAR
OF THE ROTATOR CUFF.

11:00.360 --> 11:03.249
WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?
YOU'LL NEED REST,

11:03.290 --> 11:06.418
AND REHAB TO HEAL THE MUSCLE
AND REGAIN FUNCTION
AND STRENGTH.

11:06.460 --> 11:08.849
DEPENDING ON
HOW THAT GOES,

11:08.900 --> 11:10.993
THERE'S A POSSIBILITY
OF SURGERY.

11:11.030 --> 11:13.237
WHAT ABOUT SWIMMING?

11:13.270 --> 11:16.034
IF YOU SWIM NOW,
IT COULD COMPLETELY
TEAR THE CUFF,

11:16.070 --> 11:18.732
AND THEN SURGERY WOULD BE
THE ONLY OPTION.

11:18.770 --> 11:21.034
AND AFTER SURGERY?

11:21.080 --> 11:23.708
WHEN IT COMES TO ATHLETES,

11:23.750 --> 11:27.208
THE RESULTS OF THESE PROCEDURES
ARE...UNPREDICTABLE.

11:34.490 --> 11:36.720
WOW, THOSE ARE
REALLY NICE SHOES.

11:36.760 --> 11:38.421
THANK YOU.

11:40.500 --> 11:41.990
UH, LOT OF PAPERWORK?

11:42.030 --> 11:44.191
I'M JUST TRYING
TO STAY AHEAD.

11:44.230 --> 11:47.199
WELL, I DON'T WANT
TO INTERRUPT.
YOU'RE NOT INTERRUPTING.

11:47.240 --> 11:48.696
PLEASE.

11:52.440 --> 11:54.078
( horn honks )

11:57.880 --> 12:00.314
YOU KNOW,
I'VE BEEN THINKING A LOT

12:00.350 --> 12:03.808
ABOUT ALL THE MONEY
YOU FOUND IN WILDEN'S
SAFE DEPOSIT BOX.

12:03.850 --> 12:06.489
I MEAN, THERE MUST HAVE BEEN,
LIKE, THOUSANDS IN THERE.

12:06.520 --> 12:08.454
HMM. MUST HAVE BEEN.

12:09.460 --> 12:11.052
AND THE OTHER STUFF TOO.

12:11.090 --> 12:15.754
YOU KNOW, THE GUN AND...
THE PASSPORTS.

12:15.800 --> 12:19.497
I MEAN, NORMAL PEOPLE
REALLY DON'T KEEP THAT STUFF
IN A SAFE DEPOSIT BOX, DO THEY?

12:19.530 --> 12:22.397
YOU'D BE SURPRISED
WHAT NORMAL PEOPLE DO.

12:24.170 --> 12:27.833
I DON'T KNOW, IT JUST
MAKES ME THINK THAT
MAYBE HE WAS CROOKED

12:27.880 --> 12:31.839
OR...IN THE RUSSIAN MOB
OR SOMETHING.

12:33.180 --> 12:37.014
IS THERE A LOT OF
RUSSIAN MOB ACTIVITY
HERE IN ROSEWOOD?

12:37.050 --> 12:40.417
(laughs) NO, I JUST, UM,

12:40.460 --> 12:43.850
I DON'T THINK IT'S SOMETHING
AN HONEST PERSON WOULD DO.

12:43.890 --> 12:47.519
BUT I GUESS YOU FIGURE
ALL THAT STUFF OUT WHEN YOU
WORK ON YOUR CASE, RIGHT?

12:47.560 --> 12:50.222
MOSTLY IT'S TALKING
TO PEOPLE.

12:53.600 --> 12:55.795
YOU KNOW, THE OTHER DAY

12:55.840 --> 12:58.263
I SAW YOUR PARTNER
TALKING TO MELISSA HASTINGS.

12:58.310 --> 13:00.198
YES, HE DID TALK TO HER.

13:00.240 --> 13:02.800
YEAH. SHE KNEW WILDEN.

13:02.850 --> 13:05.171
THEY WENT TO HIGH SCHOOL
TOGETHER.

13:05.210 --> 13:07.269
THEY WERE PRETTY CLOSE.

13:07.320 --> 13:09.345
HE HAD A BOAT IN CAPE MAY,

13:09.380 --> 13:11.985
AND SHE WENT ON IT
A COUPLE TIMES.

13:13.620 --> 13:15.815
DID YOU EVER
GO ON HIS BOAT?

13:15.860 --> 13:17.020
ME?
HMM.

13:18.030 --> 13:20.021
NO.

13:20.060 --> 13:22.358
HOW MANY TIMES
DID YOU SPEAK TO WILDEN

13:22.400 --> 13:25.289
OVER THE PAST YEAR OR SO?

13:25.330 --> 13:26.831
HOW MANY?

13:26.870 --> 13:29.293
WELL, A ROUGH IDEA.

13:29.340 --> 13:30.898
ADD IT UP.

13:30.940 --> 13:33.829
THE TIMES THAT HE CAME
TO YOUR SCHOOL TO TALK TO YOU

13:33.880 --> 13:36.030
WHEN YOU AND YOUR FRIENDS
WERE ARRESTED WITH THAT SHOVEL,

13:36.080 --> 13:39.049
AND THE TIMES THAT
HE WAS AT YOUR HOUSE
VISITING YOUR MOTHER--

13:39.080 --> 13:43.346
I MEAN, HOW OFTEN DO YOU THINK?
BALLPARK NUMBER.

13:43.390 --> 13:45.415
Caleb: HEY.

13:45.450 --> 13:47.509
I'VE BEEN WAITING FOR YOU
AT THE BREW.

13:47.560 --> 13:49.084
WHAT'D YOU DO,
FORGET ABOUT ME?

13:49.120 --> 13:51.554
OHH! I'M SORRY.
I TOTALLY FORGOT.

13:51.590 --> 13:53.922
UM...

13:53.960 --> 13:55.325
I-I GOTTA GO.

13:55.360 --> 13:57.225
WELL, THAT'S ALL RIGHT.

13:57.270 --> 13:59.989
WE'LL FINISH
OUR LITTLE TALK LATER.

14:04.310 --> 14:06.505
YOU'RE LUCKY I CAME ALONG
AND GOT YOU OUT OF THAT.

14:06.540 --> 14:09.134
I KNOW WHAT I'M DOING,
OKAY?
NO, YOU DON'T.

14:09.180 --> 14:11.569
YOU'RE USED TO DEALING
WITH ROSEWOOD'S FINEST.

14:11.610 --> 14:14.215
THEY CAN'T FIND
THEIR NIGHTSTICKS
WITH BOTH HANDS.

14:14.250 --> 14:16.889
SHE AND THAT OTHER
DETECTIVE ARE THE REAL DEAL.

14:16.920 --> 14:18.615
BELIEVE ME,
I KNOW THE DIFFERENCE.

14:18.650 --> 14:20.959
I WILL DO WHATEVER IT TAKES
TO PROTECT MY MOTHER.

14:20.990 --> 14:22.287
I DON'T CARE
WHAT SHE DID.

14:22.320 --> 14:24.629
HANNA, WE DON'T KNOW
WHAT SHE DID, OKAY?

14:24.660 --> 14:26.127
NONE OF US DO.

14:37.240 --> 14:39.105
Spencer: HE'S NOT IN
PENNSYLVANIA ANYMORE.

14:39.140 --> 14:41.176
I FINALLY FOUND HIM
AT A CLINIC IN NEW YORK

14:41.210 --> 14:42.677
OUTSIDE SARATOGA.

14:42.710 --> 14:44.940
THAT'S GOTTA BE HIM.

14:44.980 --> 14:47.369
DR. LOUIS PALMER, M.D.

14:47.420 --> 14:48.546
HE'S NOT LISTED AS STAFF,

14:48.580 --> 14:52.118
BUT IT'S PROBABLY SOME
CONSULTING EMERITUS
KIND OF THING.

14:52.150 --> 14:56.689
SARATOGA. THAT'S
A STRAIGHT SHOT
UP I-87.

14:56.720 --> 14:59.427
DO YOU WANT TO TRY
CALLING FIRST?

14:59.460 --> 15:03.226
NO. I DON'T WANT TO
TAKE A CHANCE THAT
HE WON'T TALK TO ME.

15:03.270 --> 15:05.397
I'LL CALL YOU
WHEN I GET THERE.

15:05.430 --> 15:07.398
I THOUGHT
WE WERE BOTH GOING.

15:07.440 --> 15:09.499
YOU GOT YOUR SISTER
TO WORRY ABOUT.

15:09.540 --> 15:12.031
THE SOONER THAT I GO,
THE SOONER I CAN GET
SOME ANSWERS

15:12.070 --> 15:14.129
AND THE SOONER
WE CAN TELL THE TRUTH.

15:14.180 --> 15:16.000
I'LL TALK TO PALMER

15:16.040 --> 15:18.440
AND GET HIM TO TELL ME
WHAT HE DIDN'T PUT IN
MY MOTHER'S FILE.

15:18.480 --> 15:20.118
DO YOU HAVE TO GO
RIGHT NOW?

15:20.150 --> 15:21.913
NOW IS ALL I'VE GOT.

15:30.490 --> 15:31.684
HEY.

15:31.730 --> 15:33.357
WHERE IS TOBY GOING?

15:33.400 --> 15:36.426
UH, HE SAID HE SAID
IT WAS ABOUT WORK.

15:36.460 --> 15:39.099
YOU KNOW WHAT HE'S DOING,
DON'T YOU?

15:39.130 --> 15:41.166
SPENCER, HE'S GOING OUT
TO FIND THE LAIR.

15:41.200 --> 15:42.690
HE CAN'T DO SOMETHING
LIKE THAT ON HIS OWN.

15:42.740 --> 15:45.004
"A" REALLY KNOWS
HOW TO HOLD A GRUDGE.

15:45.040 --> 15:47.372
I THINK HE'LL BE OKAY.

15:47.410 --> 15:49.002
SORRY I'M LATE.
HERE'S YOUR TEA.

15:49.040 --> 15:50.701
THANKS.
OKAY...

15:50.750 --> 15:54.049
SO IF YOU WANTED
A MASK MADE,

15:54.080 --> 15:55.513
WHO WOULD YOU ASK?

15:57.190 --> 15:59.010
SOMEBODY WHO WORKED
AT A COSTUME SHOP.

15:59.050 --> 16:00.358
SHANA.

16:00.390 --> 16:02.278
YOU THINK THAT
SHANA'S INVOLVED?

16:02.320 --> 16:03.685
I WANT TO SEE
WHAT HAPPENS

16:03.730 --> 16:05.721
WHEN MELISSA COMES
FACE-TO-FACE WITH THE MASK.

16:05.760 --> 16:08.194
WHERE WOULD SHE GO FIRST?
WOULD SHE GO OUT TO HECTOR'S...

16:08.230 --> 16:10.994
OR TO SHANA'S?
OR SOMEBODY ELSE.

16:13.740 --> 16:16.095
I'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
OKAY.

16:18.270 --> 16:19.464
ARE YOU READY FOR THIS?

16:19.510 --> 16:22.138
I CAN'T TONIGHT.
MELISSA ISN'T EVEN HOME TODAY.

16:22.180 --> 16:24.478
I WAS THINKING MORE
TOMORROW NIGHT.
I CAN DO THAT.

16:24.510 --> 16:27.070
OKAY.
I'M SEEING JAKE LATER.

16:27.120 --> 16:29.315
NOTICE HOW I HAVE
NO REACTION TO THAT?
I AM COMPLETELY NEUTRAL.

16:29.350 --> 16:31.113
COME ON, KNOCK IT OFF.

16:31.150 --> 16:33.482
LOOK, AFTER EVERYTHING
THAT YOU'VE BEEN THROUGH,

16:33.520 --> 16:36.455
YOU DESERVE SOMETHING
A LITTLE BIT LESS...
...INSANE?

16:36.490 --> 16:38.026
HOPELESS? IMPOSSIBLE?

16:38.060 --> 16:39.482
COM PLICATED.

16:39.530 --> 16:42.226
THAT'S WHAT
I'M TRYING FOR.

16:42.260 --> 16:45.195
I WAS WORRIED
WHEN YOU MISSED PRACTICE.

16:45.230 --> 16:48.461
WON'T BE THE ONLY ONE I MISS.
DOCTOR'S ORDERS.

16:48.500 --> 16:52.061
THAT SUCKS.
EXTREMELY.

16:52.110 --> 16:53.771
YOU'RE HANDING ME
AN EDGE.

16:53.810 --> 16:56.233
YOU DON'T NEED AN EDGE.
EVERYBODY NEEDS AN EDGE.

16:56.280 --> 16:58.441
CUT OFF THAT LAST
HUNDREDTH OF A SECOND.

16:58.480 --> 17:01.278
YOU'RE A VERY
COMPETITIVE PERSON.

17:01.320 --> 17:03.117
IN MANY WAYS.

17:06.550 --> 17:08.484
WHAT IF I--

17:11.430 --> 17:13.318
WHAT?

17:13.360 --> 17:15.225
NOTHING. NOTHING.

17:15.260 --> 17:16.750
JUST GIVE ME A KISS, OKAY?

17:23.570 --> 17:25.800
ARE YOU SERIOUS?
COME ON.

17:25.840 --> 17:27.637
THE THING ABOUT
JACKIE CHAN IS,

17:27.680 --> 17:29.409
HE DOESN'T MAKE IT
LOOK EASY--

17:29.440 --> 17:31.408
HE SHOWS YOU
HOW HARD IT IS.

17:31.450 --> 17:33.418
YEAH, HE'S KIND OF GOOFY
SOMETIMES, TOO.

17:33.450 --> 17:35.645
WELL, GOOFINESS
IS PART OF HIS CHARM.

17:35.680 --> 17:37.113
Malcolm: ARIA!

17:39.190 --> 17:41.385
HI, MALCOLM.

17:41.420 --> 17:42.557
ARE--ARE YOU HERE ALONE?

17:42.590 --> 17:45.559
MOM AND EZRA ARE INSIDE.
WE'RE BUYING BOOKS.

17:45.590 --> 17:48.491
BOOKS? WHAT KIND OF BOOKS?

17:48.530 --> 17:51.169
SCARY ONES!
THOSE ARE THE BEST KIND, RIGHT?

17:51.200 --> 17:52.519
YEAH.

17:52.570 --> 17:54.697
WHY DON'T YOU
COME OVER ANYMORE?

17:57.370 --> 17:59.361
WELL...UH,

17:59.410 --> 18:00.832
SOMETIMES PEOPLE GET BUSY,

18:00.880 --> 18:03.576
THEY CAN'T ALWAYS DO
WHAT THEY WANT TO DO.

18:03.610 --> 18:05.305
LOOK, YOU BETTER
GET BACK INSIDE BEFORE

18:05.350 --> 18:06.578
YOUR MOM AND DAD START
LOOKING FOR YOU, OKAY?

18:06.610 --> 18:09.511
OKAY. BYE.

18:09.550 --> 18:11.745
BYE!
SEE YA LATER, BUDDY.

18:15.460 --> 18:16.859
NICE KID.

18:16.890 --> 18:18.619
YEAH. HE IS.

18:24.800 --> 18:26.768
NO, JUST ONE OF
MY TEACHERS.

18:39.910 --> 18:43.448
WELL, I KNEW YOU WERE
INTERESTING WHEN I MET YOU.

18:43.490 --> 18:46.744
I JUST DIDN'T KNOW
HOW INTERESTING.

18:46.790 --> 18:50.226
YEAH. I MEAN, WHEN ITELL
THE WHOLE STORY LIKE THAT,

18:50.260 --> 18:52.626
IT KINDA SOUNDS
LIKE A MOVIE.

18:52.660 --> 18:54.457
BLACK AND WHITE
OR COLOR?

18:54.500 --> 18:59.119
HAPPY PARTS ARE IN COLOR,
THE SAD PARTS ARE IN
BLACK AND WHITE.

19:10.780 --> 19:13.248
YOU KNOW YOU'RE NOT
FINISHED WITH HIM,
DON'T YOU?

19:13.280 --> 19:15.874
NO, I-I HAVE TO BE FINISHED.

19:15.920 --> 19:17.842
FOR EVERYBODY'S SAKE.

19:17.890 --> 19:20.518
YOU MIGHT HAVE TO BE,
BUT I'M TELLING YOU
YOU'RE NOT.

19:20.560 --> 19:23.882
NO, IT'S DONE.
THE MOVIE'S OVER.

19:26.590 --> 19:28.820
WHAT MAKES YOU SO SURE?

19:37.440 --> 19:39.408
DO YOU REALLY WANT TO BE
WITH SOMEONE WHO'D KISS YOU

19:39.440 --> 19:42.375
AFTER YOU TELL HIM
A STORY LIKE THAT?

19:42.410 --> 19:43.946
BUT I HAVE TO DO SOMETHING.

19:43.980 --> 19:46.847
I CAN'T JUST...
STAY IN THIS PLACE.

19:54.590 --> 19:57.957
SOMETIMES
WHEN I'M TEACHING A CLASS

19:57.990 --> 20:02.222
A KID'LL TAKE A BAD HIT
AND HE STARTS TO CRY.

20:02.260 --> 20:06.560
AND I'LL ASK HIM,
"ARE YOU HURT,
OR ARE YOU INJURED?

20:06.600 --> 20:08.830
"IF YOU'RE INJURED,
I'LL SEND YOU HOME.

20:08.870 --> 20:10.929
"BUT IF YOU'RE HURT...

20:10.970 --> 20:14.531
SHAKE IT OFF
AND GET BACK ON THE MAT."

20:17.450 --> 20:21.716
YOU HAVE TO FIGURE OUT IF
YOU'RE HURT OR YOU'RE INJURED.

20:21.750 --> 20:24.480
LOOK, I KNOW THAT
THAT WAS SUPPOSED
TO BE HELPFUL,

20:24.520 --> 20:26.886
BUT THAT JUST WENT
CLEAN OVER MY HEAD.

20:29.060 --> 20:31.278
IT'S THE ONLY ADVICE
I HAVE.

20:31.330 --> 20:34.254
I USE IT FOR EVERYTHING.

20:34.300 --> 20:36.359
SOMETIMES IT APPLIES.

20:43.640 --> 20:44.959
CAN I CALL YOU?

20:48.540 --> 20:50.576
YES.

20:50.610 --> 20:52.908
YOU CAN CALL ME.

20:56.950 --> 20:59.510
DR. LOUIS PALMER?

20:59.550 --> 21:01.415
THANK YOU.

21:09.700 --> 21:12.624
DR. PALMER?

21:12.670 --> 21:14.490
I'M LOUIS PALMER, YES.

21:14.540 --> 21:16.531
MY NAME IS TOBY CAVANAUGH,

21:16.570 --> 21:19.300
I'D LIKE TO ASK YOU
ABOUT A PATIENT YOU HAD...

21:19.340 --> 21:21.979
WHEN YOU WORKED AT
RADLEY SANITARIUM.

21:22.010 --> 21:23.773
IN ROSEWOOD.

21:23.810 --> 21:26.904
YES, SIR, IN ROSEWOOD.

21:26.950 --> 21:29.612
THE PATIENT WAS MY MOTHER.

21:29.650 --> 21:32.380
MARION CAVANAUGH.

21:34.560 --> 21:36.312
SHE KILLED HERSELF.

21:39.560 --> 21:41.949
PLEASE SIT DOWN.

21:43.470 --> 21:45.028
Hanna:
SO WHAT'D THEY SAY?

21:45.070 --> 21:47.061
THEY SAID FOR THE TIME BEING

21:47.100 --> 21:49.660
I WON'T BE TAKING CLIENTS
INTO THE SAFE DEPOSIT VAULT.

21:49.700 --> 21:53.807
WAIT. IS THIS BECAUSE OF
THE STATE INVESTIGATORS
AND WILDEN'S BOX?

21:53.840 --> 21:56.638
DID THEY TELL THE BANK
TO DO THIS?
I DON'T KNOW.

21:56.680 --> 21:59.899
WELL, ASK THEM.
NO MORE QUESTIONS, HANNA.

21:59.950 --> 22:02.874
MOM, YOU HAVE THE RIGHT TO KNOW!
AND WHAT IF THEY SAY YES?

22:05.850 --> 22:10.526
"YES, THE STATE POLICE SUGGESTED
IT MIGHT BE A GOOD IDEA TO
KEEP YOU OUT OF THE VAULT."

22:10.560 --> 22:12.926
WHAT DO I DO THEN?

22:14.460 --> 22:16.928
I WAS KIND OF HOPING
WITH WILDEN DEAD

22:16.960 --> 22:19.099
IT'D BE THE END OF IT.

22:19.130 --> 22:22.531
I THOUGHT SO TOO,
FOR A MINUTE.

22:24.040 --> 22:26.907
NOW HE'S DEAD
AND THINGS ARE
WORSE THEN EVER.

22:26.940 --> 22:29.431
ARE THEY?

22:35.020 --> 22:37.580
THIS WILL NOT TOUCH YOU.

22:37.620 --> 22:41.488
I PROMISE.
NO MATTER WHAT HAPPENS...

22:41.520 --> 22:44.455
IT WON'T TOUCH YOU.

22:44.490 --> 22:47.926
MOM, I KNOW YOU WERE HERE...

22:47.960 --> 22:51.020
IN ROSEWOOD THE NIGHT
THAT WILDEN WAS KILLED.

22:53.470 --> 22:54.937
HOW DO YOU KNOW THAT?

22:57.770 --> 23:03.777
I WAS KIND OF HOPING
THAT YOU WOULD DENY IT
ONE MORE TIME.

23:03.810 --> 23:06.142
Dr. Palmer: WHEN SOMETHING
LIKE THAT HAPPENS,

23:06.180 --> 23:07.613
YOU LOOK BACK.

23:07.650 --> 23:11.746
YOU TAKE APART
EVERY CONVERSATION...

23:11.790 --> 23:16.887
"DID I DO SOMETHING WRONG?
DID I MISS A WARNING SIGN?"

23:16.920 --> 23:20.720
YOU TALKED TO HER
ON THE DAY SHE DIED.

23:20.760 --> 23:22.125
YES. YES, I DID.

23:22.160 --> 23:23.923
YOU KNOW, SOME PEOPLE,

23:23.970 --> 23:25.767
IT'S LIKE...

23:25.800 --> 23:28.689
THE AIR WEIGHS MORE
FOR THEM,

23:28.740 --> 23:32.904
PUSHES THEM DOWN,
WEARS THEM OUT.

23:32.940 --> 23:36.103
AND YOUR MOTHER...
SHE WAS LIKE THAT.

23:37.710 --> 23:40.543
AND THEN SHE FELL.

23:41.980 --> 23:45.416
THERE'S A BIG DIFFERENCE
BETWEEN FALLING
AND BEING PUSHED.

23:47.690 --> 23:49.157
I'VE SEEN THE ROOF.

23:51.560 --> 23:53.824
YOU DON'T THINK
SHE JUMPED, DO YOU?

23:55.100 --> 23:57.967
DOCTORS CAN EXPERIENCE
DENIAL, TOO.

24:03.740 --> 24:07.972
DID SHE HAVE ANY TROUBLE
WITH ANY OF THE OTHER PATIENTS?

24:08.010 --> 24:11.502
WHO ON THE STAFF,
ASIDE FROM YOU,
DID SHE TALK TO?

24:11.550 --> 24:14.178
DID SHE HAVE ANY VISITORS?

24:18.820 --> 24:20.788
SHE LOVED YOU, TOBY.

24:22.120 --> 24:25.089
SHE HATED BEING
AWAY FROM YOU.

24:25.130 --> 24:29.157
BUT THERE WERE FORCES THAT
WERE JUST TOO MUCH FOR HER.

24:31.000 --> 24:33.992
FORCES. PEOPLE?

24:34.040 --> 24:36.031
DID SHE EVER MENTION
ANY NAMES?

24:36.070 --> 24:37.537
AS I SAID,

24:37.570 --> 24:40.835
THE AIR, IT JUST
GOT TOO HEAW FOR HER.

24:40.880 --> 24:42.575
I MEAN,
THAT'S A REAL PROBLEM.

24:42.610 --> 24:45.773
THE AIR, IT'S JUST
TO HEAW FOR THEM.

24:45.810 --> 24:47.971
I'M STUDYING THAT NOW.

24:48.020 --> 24:50.511
STUDYING...WHAT?

24:51.750 --> 24:53.650
THE HEAVINESS OF AIR.

24:53.690 --> 24:55.180
I'VE MADE IT
MY LIFE'S WORK.

24:55.220 --> 24:57.780
THERE ARE TOO MANY
GOOD PEOPLE

24:57.830 --> 25:00.958
BEING CRUSHED BY
THE HEAVINESS OF AIR.

25:07.170 --> 25:10.901
HOW LONG HAVE YOU BEEN
WORKING HERE, DR. PALMER?

25:12.310 --> 25:16.076
OH, WELL, THEY LET ME, UM,
DO SOME RESEARCH HERE,

25:16.110 --> 25:19.102
BUT I'M NOT FORMALLY
AFFILIATED WITH THE STAFF.

25:19.150 --> 25:23.917
BUT YOU LIVE HERE,
DON'T YOU?

25:23.950 --> 25:25.815
YE-YES.

25:25.850 --> 25:27.556
YES, I LIVE HERE.

25:27.590 --> 25:29.251
( chuckles )

25:29.290 --> 25:31.224
ARE YOU SURE YOU WON'T
HAVE A MACAROON?

25:31.260 --> 25:33.649
OH, NO. THANK YOU.

25:33.700 --> 25:35.292
SORRY I BOTHERED YOU.

25:35.330 --> 25:38.026
NO. IT--
IT'S NO BOTHER.

25:38.070 --> 25:41.164
IT'S ALWAYS NICE
TO HAVE VISITORS.

25:41.200 --> 25:43.737
COME BACK,
ALL RIGHT? BUT...

25:43.770 --> 25:46.261
BRING YOUR MOTHER
NEXT TIME.

25:46.310 --> 25:49.177
I'D LOVE TO SEE HER
AGAIN.

25:49.210 --> 25:51.701
YES, SIR.

25:51.750 --> 25:54.742
YOU TELL HER TO
STAY AWAY FROM THAT GIRL!

25:59.820 --> 26:01.310
WHAT GIRL?

26:01.360 --> 26:03.954
THE GIRL!

26:03.990 --> 26:06.754
THAT BLOND GIRL.

26:06.790 --> 26:10.191
THERE'S SOMETHING WRONG
WITH THE AIR AROUND THAT ONE.

26:11.330 --> 26:13.218
VERY TROUBLING.

26:50.000 --> 26:53.208
Spencer:
"WHAT'S MY SUITCASE
DOING DOWN HERE?

26:53.240 --> 26:55.936
"MAYBE MOM BROUGHT IT IN
FROM THE BARN?

26:55.980 --> 26:58.198
BUT WHY?"

27:11.830 --> 27:13.889
Spencer: "WHAT'S IN HERE?"

27:33.280 --> 27:35.373
"WHAT THE THE HELL IS THIS?"

27:37.790 --> 27:41.180
NO, IT'S JUST YOU,
MELISSA.

27:41.220 --> 27:43.415
JUST YOU AND THAT MASK.

27:43.460 --> 27:46.020
NOW, WHERE DID IT COME FROM?

27:46.060 --> 27:48.153
IS SHE GONNA FIGURE IT OUT?
YEAH.

27:48.200 --> 27:51.863
JUST GIVE HER A SECOND.
SHE'S SMART. VERY SMART.

28:03.140 --> 28:05.279
OKAY, WORK IT OUT,
MELISSA.

28:05.310 --> 28:06.971
WHERE COULD IT
HAVE COME FROM?

28:07.010 --> 28:08.944
WHO COULD HAVE MADE IT?

28:12.220 --> 28:14.085
GOOD GIRL.

28:14.120 --> 28:16.156
THAT'S WHERE
IT MUST HAVE COME FROM.

28:16.190 --> 28:18.954
NOW WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO?

28:33.940 --> 28:34.975
YOU KNOW, YOUR MOTHER AND I
HAVE CUT YOU A LOT OF SLACK.

28:37.510 --> 28:41.776
AND NOW THIS INJURY
SIDELINES YOU INDEFINITELY...

28:41.820 --> 28:45.085
AND YOU STILL HAVEN'T
TOLD US THE WHOLE TRUTH
ABOUT HOW IT HAPPENED.

28:45.120 --> 28:47.338
DOES IT MATTER
HOW IT HAPPENED?
IT DOE MATTER!

28:47.390 --> 28:48.812
IT MATTERS TO US,
AND TO FAMILY SERVICES.

28:48.860 --> 28:52.352
THOSE PEOPLE THINK
THAT WHAT HAPPENED TO YOU
HAPPENED IN THIS HOUSE!

28:52.390 --> 28:54.221
IT DIDN'T.
THEN WHERE DID IT HAPPEN?!

28:55.530 --> 28:58.419
DID SOMEBODY HURT YOU?
NO! CAN YOU JUST TRUST ME?

28:58.470 --> 29:00.199
THIS HAS NOTHING
TO DO WITH TRUST!

29:00.230 --> 29:03.802
THIS HAS TO DO WITH
WHAT WE HAVE A RIGHT TO KNOW
AS YOUR PARENTS!

29:03.840 --> 29:06.104
DAD, DON'T SHOUT.

29:08.010 --> 29:10.228
YOU WANT US TO TRUST YOU--
WHAT ABOUT TRUSTING US?

29:10.280 --> 29:12.976
YOU CUT US OUT OF
EVERYTHING THAT'S GOING ON,

29:13.010 --> 29:15.012
AND SUDDENLY THE POLICE
THINK WE HURT YOU?

29:15.050 --> 29:18.087
I TRIED TO EXPLAIN, OKAY?
I TALKED TO DR. VARGAS.

29:18.120 --> 29:21.112
YOU TALKED TO HIM?
YOU ARE NOT TO
TALK TO THAT MAN!

29:21.160 --> 29:23.355
EMILY,
WE'RE NOT DONE HERE!

29:23.390 --> 29:26.518
LOOK, I'M SORRY, OKAY?!
I'M REALLY, REALLY SORRY!

29:26.560 --> 29:28.892
THERE ARE OTHER THINGS
THAT WE NEED TO TALK ABOUT.

29:28.930 --> 29:32.127
ALL RIGHT? WE HAVE
BIG CHANGES THAT
WE HAVE TO DEAL WITH.

29:32.170 --> 29:34.832
LIKE WHERE YOU'RE
GOING TO COLLEGE,
HOW WE'RE GOING TO PAY.

29:34.870 --> 29:36.895
HONEY, WE CAN TALK
ABOUT THAT LATER.

29:36.940 --> 29:39.329
I KNOW I SCREWED UP
THE SCHOLARSHIPS
IF I CAN'T SWIM.

29:39.370 --> 29:41.133
WELL, I'LL GET ANOTHER JOB.
I'LL GET THREE.

29:41.180 --> 29:45.469
EMILY, YOU'VE BEEN THROUGH MORE
THINGS THAN ANYBODY AT YOUR AGE
SHOULD HAVE TO SURVIVE,

29:45.510 --> 29:49.241
BUT YOUR MOTHER AND I
THOUGHT I WAS OVER,
AND IT'S NOT, IS IT?

29:50.580 --> 29:52.480
IS IT?
I DON'T KNOW!

29:52.520 --> 29:54.112
OKAY? I DON'T KNOW!

30:00.190 --> 30:01.293
EMILY!
EMILY!

30:01.330 --> 30:02.820
STOP!
EMILY!!!

30:02.860 --> 30:05.294
COME BACK HERE THIS SECOND,
DO YOU HEAR ME?!

30:05.330 --> 30:08.936
Hanna:
WE'VE ALWAYS BEEN THERE
FOR EACH OTHER,

30:08.970 --> 30:10.597
BEEN THE ONE THAT
THE OTHER NEEDED,

30:10.640 --> 30:13.302
AND I DON'T KNOW,
I GUESS YOU'RE RIGHT,
I'M OUT OF MY LEAGUE.

30:13.340 --> 30:16.377
WHAT DID YOUR MOM SAY
WHEN YOU WERE IN HER ROOM?

30:16.410 --> 30:18.378
THAT SHE CAME BACK
THAT NIGHT.

30:18.410 --> 30:20.913
SHE LEFT NEW YORK
AND SHE CAME TO ROSEWOOD.

30:20.950 --> 30:22.508
TO MEET WILDEN?

30:22.550 --> 30:24.347
I DON'T KNOW,
SHE WOULDN'T TELL ME.

30:24.390 --> 30:27.382
I MEAN, WHY WOULD SHE
ASK MY DAD FOR MONEY?

30:27.420 --> 30:30.548
I DON'T KNOW.
MAYBE SHE WAS GONNA
PAY WILDEN OFF.

30:30.590 --> 30:34.196
OR MAYBE SHE WAS
GONNA PAY SOMEBODY--
TO WHAT, KILL HIM?

30:34.230 --> 30:37.358
I DIDN'T SAY THAT.
YEAH, BUT YOU WERE
THINKING IT.

30:37.400 --> 30:40.995
NO, I'M THINKING
WHAT OTHER PEOPLE
MIGHT THINK.

30:41.040 --> 30:43.338
HANNA, DID SHE SAY
ANYTHING ABOUT THE GUN?

30:43.370 --> 30:45.429
( doorbell rings )

30:51.450 --> 30:53.645
( door opens )

30:53.680 --> 30:55.545
Gabe: HELLO, HAN NA.

30:55.580 --> 30:57.445
Hanna: HEY.

31:01.390 --> 31:03.085
WE WERE HOPING TO
TALK TO YOUR MOM.

31:03.120 --> 31:05.156
UH, SHE'S NOT HERE.
REALLY?

31:05.190 --> 31:07.897
HER CAR IS OUT FRONT.

31:10.630 --> 31:13.190
YEAH, YOU KNOW WHAT?
I ACTUALLY DROVE IT HERE.

31:13.230 --> 31:14.959
ONE OF THE SPEAKERS
WAS SHORTING OUT,

31:15.000 --> 31:17.639
SO HANNA'S MOM
ASKED ME TO TAKE A LOOK.

31:17.670 --> 31:19.604
CALEB, RIGHT?

31:19.640 --> 31:22.177
YEAH.
YEAH, THAT'S RIGHT.

31:24.680 --> 31:27.399
WELL, TELL YOUR MOM...
WE STOPPED BY.

31:28.580 --> 31:31.287
YEAH. YEAH, I WILL.

31:47.030 --> 31:48.998
( door opens )

32:01.220 --> 32:04.280
SO, I TAKE IT
THIS IS HECTOR'S PLACE.

32:04.320 --> 32:06.641
YEP, IN ALL ITS CREEPINESS.

32:19.270 --> 32:22.637
(whispering) IS THAT SACK
BIG ENOUGl-IIWF)OR HECTOR?

32:22.670 --> 32:24.433
GOOD.

32:27.340 --> 32:29.137
OKAY, I WANT TO FOLLOW MELISSA.

32:29.180 --> 32:31.148
CAN YOU KEEP AN EYE
ON HECTOR?

32:31.180 --> 32:33.944
YEAH, SURE. I'VE HAD ALL OF
THREE MARTIAL ARTS LESSONS.

33:26.530 --> 33:28.634
( bird screeches in distance)

33:35.480 --> 33:37.277
( splashing )

33:49.520 --> 33:51.624
( bird screeches )

34:16.650 --> 34:19.289
KNOCK KNOCK.
( gasps )

34:19.320 --> 34:21.618
I'M CLOSED FOR BUSINESS
RIGHT NOW.

34:21.660 --> 34:24.686
WELL, YOU PROBABLY
SHOULD HAVE LOCKED
YOUR DOORS.

34:24.730 --> 34:27.221
YOU TOLD EMILY THAT
YOU DESTROYED ALL OF THESE.

34:27.260 --> 34:31.219
I SAID I DESTROYED THE MOLD.
I KEPT THE CASTING.

34:31.270 --> 34:32.828
SO YOU LIED.

34:32.870 --> 34:36.636
I DIDN'T HAVE THE HEART
TO DESTROY THEM.

34:36.670 --> 34:39.707
I MEAN, LOOK AT HER.

34:39.740 --> 34:42.675
SHE'S BEAUTIFUL.

34:42.710 --> 34:45.474
DID ALISON EVER
COME OUT HERE
WITH ANYBODY ELSE?

34:45.510 --> 34:48.479
NO. SHE WAS ALWAYS ALONE.

34:49.780 --> 34:51.645
EXCEPT--
EXCEPT WHAT?

34:53.690 --> 34:54.714
Alison: HEY!

34:54.760 --> 34:56.455
I WANT THE REST OF MY MONEY!

34:56.490 --> 34:58.321
WHEN I GET PAID,
YOU GET PAID.

34:58.360 --> 35:00.453
THAT WAS THE DEAL.
PAYMENT ON DELIVERY,

35:00.490 --> 35:02.458
MINUS THE COST OF
THE MASKS YOU WANTED.

35:02.500 --> 35:03.626
HOW MUCH DO YOU HAVE
RIGHT NOW?

35:03.660 --> 35:05.764
WELL, NOT WHAT I OWE YOU,
THAT'S FOR SURE.

35:05.800 --> 35:08.189
I'LL TAKE WHAT YOU GOT
AND CALL IT SQUARE.

35:08.240 --> 35:09.764
GIVE ME THE MONEY!

35:16.340 --> 35:18.308
I'LL STILL PAY YOU THE REST
WHEN I GET IT.

35:20.250 --> 35:21.717
WHAT'S THE QUICKEST WAY
TO ROUTE 30 FROM HERE?

35:21.750 --> 35:23.718
GO AROUND THE LAKE,
PICK UP LIMERICK ROAD,

35:23.750 --> 35:25.889
TAKE 202 TO
THE EXTON BYPASS.

35:41.470 --> 35:43.461
Hector:
AND THAT WAS THE LAST
I SAW OF HER.

35:43.500 --> 35:45.639
DID YOU SEE WHO
WAS DRIVING THE CAR?

35:45.670 --> 35:47.331
BAD ANGLE.

35:47.370 --> 35:48.906
WHEN WAS THIS?

35:48.940 --> 35:51.204
THAT SUMMER
SHE DISAPPEARED.

36:03.560 --> 36:05.255
H ELLO, M ELISSA.

36:07.360 --> 36:10.659
YOU PUT THAT MASK
IN MY BAG.

36:10.700 --> 36:12.429
YOU FOLLOW ME.

36:12.470 --> 36:14.631
YOU CAN'T RUN TO YOUR ROOM
RIGHT NOW. NOT THIS TIME.

36:14.670 --> 36:16.968
WE'RE NOT GOING ANYWHERE
UNTIL I GET SOME ANSWERS.

36:17.000 --> 36:19.366
WHEN WAS THE LAST TIME
AN ANSWER MADE YOU ANY HAPPIER?

36:19.410 --> 36:20.763
WERE YOU ON
THE HALLOWEEN TRAIN?

36:22.740 --> 36:25.709
IS THAT WHERE YOU SAW MONA
IN THE ALI MASK?

36:25.750 --> 36:27.149
IT WA MONA.

36:27.180 --> 36:31.287
THAT WOMAN THAT WAS JUST HERE,
THAT WOMAN THAT LEFT
WITH THE SACK...

36:31.320 --> 36:33.538
SHE WANTED TO KNOW
ABOUT THOSE.

36:33.590 --> 36:35.558
I MADE HER THE SAME DEAL.

36:35.590 --> 36:39.219
SHE TRADED HER FACE
FOR INFORMATION?

36:39.260 --> 36:40.784
WHAT DID YOU TELL HER?

36:42.000 --> 36:43.592
LESS THAN I TOLD YOU.

36:46.600 --> 36:50.536
YOU KNOW, YOU HAVE
A VERY INTERESTING FACE.

36:51.910 --> 36:54.708
YEAH, I'M GONNA KEEP IT,
TOO.

36:54.740 --> 36:57.379
YOU ASKED SHANA WHERE SOMEBODY
COULD GET A MASK LIKE THAT.

36:57.410 --> 36:59.503
YOU WANTED TO KNOW
IF ALISON CAME HERE
AND ORDERED IT.

36:59.550 --> 37:02.246
AND I WANTED TO KNOW
WHEN IT WAS MADE.

37:02.280 --> 37:05.317
BEFORE OR AFTER
ALI DISAPPEARED?

37:05.350 --> 37:07.443
DON'T TELL ME YOU HAVEN'T
THOUGHT ABOUT IT YOURSELF.

37:07.490 --> 37:09.981
THAT ALI'S STILL ALIVE?
I HAVE, BUT IT'S CRAZY!

37:10.020 --> 37:12.454
CRAZIER THAN
ANYTHING ELSE
THAT'S HAPPENED?

37:12.490 --> 37:16.950
MELISSA...
ON THE HALLOWEEN TRAIN,
DID YOU TRY TO KILL ME?

37:17.000 --> 37:19.867
THAT WAS WILDEN.
WE HAD THE SAME COSTUME.

37:19.900 --> 37:22.869
SHOWING UP IN THE SAME OUTFIT?
THAT MUST HAVE BEEN AWKWARD.

37:22.900 --> 37:25.300
WHY WERE YOU HELPING WILDEN?
I WASN'T HELPING HIM!

37:25.340 --> 37:27.558
NONE OF US HELPED HIM.
WE WERE AFRAID OF HIM.

37:27.610 --> 37:28.975
WHO'S WE? THE N.A.T. CLUB?

37:29.010 --> 37:31.342
THIS ISN'T ABOUT
SOME STUPID CLUB!

37:31.380 --> 37:33.541
BUT THERE IS A CONNECTION.

37:33.580 --> 37:36.469
THERE IS SOME OVERLAP
WITH THE CLUB AND WHAT
HAPPENED TO ALISON,

37:36.520 --> 37:38.385
AND WILDEN WAS BLACKMAILING
YOU ALL BECAUSE OF IT.

37:38.420 --> 37:41.548
WILDEN WASN'T THAT SMART.
SOMEBODY WAS TELLING HIM
WHAT TO DO.

37:41.590 --> 37:43.558
SO SOMEBODY TOLD WILDEN
TO BE ON THE TRAIN,

37:43.590 --> 37:46.388
TO KILL ME AND ARIA
AND ANYBODY ELSE WHO
COULD FIGURE IT OUT.

37:46.430 --> 37:49.024
I DIDN'T KNOW ABOUT HURTING YOU
UNTIL I WAS ON THE TRAIN.

37:49.060 --> 37:53.599
BECAUSE GARRETT SHOWED UP
AND SUDDENLY IT BECAME MORE
IMPORTANT TO KILL HIM.

37:53.630 --> 37:55.769
YOU COULD HAVE WARNED US,
MELISSA.

37:55.800 --> 37:57.336
YOU KNEW,
AND YOU DID NOTHING.

37:57.370 --> 38:00.362
YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND!
YOU NEVER UNDERSTOOD!

38:02.540 --> 38:04.940
SINCE BEFORE IT STARTED!

38:04.980 --> 38:07.904
SO YOU SENT JENNA AND SHANA
TO BURN DOWN THE LODGE?

38:07.950 --> 38:10.771
I DIDN'T SEND THEM TO HURT YOU.
I SENT THEM TO WATCH YOU.

38:10.820 --> 38:11.946
WATCH US? WHY?

38:11.990 --> 38:14.379
TO FIND OUT WHO
YOU WERE GOING TO MEET.

38:14.420 --> 38:15.785
TO FIND OUT IF IT--

38:17.390 --> 38:19.881
IF IT WAS--
ALISON?

38:19.930 --> 38:21.557
JENNA AND SHANA
DIDN'T START THE FIRE.

38:21.600 --> 38:22.749
IT WAS WILDEN.
THEY SAW HIM.

38:22.800 --> 38:24.995
SO IS THAT WHO
PULLED EVERYBODY OUT?
JENNA AND SHANA?

38:25.030 --> 38:26.759
NO, IT WAS SOMEBODY ELSE.

38:26.800 --> 38:28.631
IT WAS THE PERSON
WHO GOT OFF THE PLANE.
THE ONE IN THE RED COAT.

38:28.670 --> 38:30.069
THEY DIDN'T SEE.

38:30.100 --> 38:32.068
WHAT DO THEY
HAVE TO DO WITH THIS?

38:32.110 --> 38:34.032
HOW DO YOU KNOW THEM?

38:34.070 --> 38:36.573
WHY DO YOU STILL THINK
ALI'S ALIVE?

38:41.650 --> 38:43.675
MELISSA...

38:43.720 --> 38:45.688
DID YOU KILL
DETECTIVE WILDEN?

38:45.720 --> 38:47.688
LET IT GO, SPENCER.

38:47.720 --> 38:50.086
YOU HA TO LET IT GO
OR IT WILL COME APART

38:50.120 --> 38:52.759
IN WAYS THAT YOU CANNOT
EVEN IMAGINE.

39:06.470 --> 39:08.904
( door clanks shut
in distance )

39:15.820 --> 39:18.015
(relieved sigh)
HI!

39:18.050 --> 39:19.984
HEY.

39:35.600 --> 39:37.363
WHAT'S WRONG?

39:42.910 --> 39:45.071
( footsteps approach )

39:45.110 --> 39:47.476
WHERE'S MELISSA?

39:47.510 --> 39:48.738
SHE'S GONE.

39:48.780 --> 39:50.839
WELL,
WHERE'D SHE GO?

40:06.630 --> 40:07.722
IT SHOULDN'T HAVE
HAPPENED LIKE THIS.
IT'S MY FAULT.

40:10.600 --> 40:13.865
YEAH, YOU SHOULD HAVE JUST
LET "A" HIT ARIA AND MONA
WITH THAT CAR.

40:13.910 --> 40:15.502
I'M SERIOUS.

40:15.540 --> 40:17.974
EM, WE CAN FIND
ANOTHER DREAM.

40:19.610 --> 40:22.443
I'M NOT SO SURE.

40:22.480 --> 40:24.914
I DON'T KNOW IF I CAN BE
ONE OF THOSE GIRLS

40:24.950 --> 40:28.408
WHO SITS UP IN THE STANDS
AND...WATCHES YOU WIN.

40:29.890 --> 40:33.053
WHAT IF I CAN'T TAKE THAT?

40:33.090 --> 40:34.796
WELL, YOU'RE NOT
GONNA HAVE TO,

40:34.830 --> 40:36.798
BECAUSE YOU'RE GONNA
SWIM AGAIN.

40:36.830 --> 40:39.663
HE SAID THAT I NEED SURGERY.
HE SAID
YOU MIGHT NEED SURGERY.

40:39.700 --> 40:42.498
AND THAT THE OUTCOME
IS UNPRSEODICT ABLE.

40:42.540 --> 40:45.008
UNPREDICT ABLE
CAN BE GOOD.
LOOK AT US.

40:47.570 --> 40:50.733
WITH ALL THESE TERRIBLE THINGS
IN MY LIFE RIGHT NOW...

40:50.780 --> 40:53.874
WHY DO I FEEL SO LUCKY?
( laughs )

40:55.650 --> 40:57.845
I'LL TAKE YOU HOME.

40:57.880 --> 40:59.882
IT'LL BE OKAY.

41:15.170 --> 41:17.991
( police radio chatter)

41:24.750 --> 41:26.502
MOM.

41:26.550 --> 41:27.949
WHAT'S GOING ON?

41:27.980 --> 41:30.778
SOMEONE CALLED THE POLICE
ABOUT A DOMESTIC DISTURBANCE.

41:30.820 --> 41:32.117
WHERE?

41:32.150 --> 41:33.981
HERE. AT OUR HOUSE.

41:34.020 --> 41:35.112
WHEN WE WERE SHOUTING?

41:35.160 --> 41:37.287
THEY JUST WANT TO TALK TO YOU
AND MAKE SURE YOU'RE OKAY.

41:37.320 --> 41:39.049
OF COURSE I'M OKAY.
WHAT DO THEY THINK HAPPENED?

41:39.090 --> 41:41.991
I DON'T KNOW.

41:42.030 --> 41:45.261
Wayne:
WE HAVE A RIGHT TO KNOW
WHAT'S BEING SAID ABOUT US.

41:45.300 --> 41:47.689
LOOK, IT'S ALL JUST
A BIG MISTAKE, SO COME ON,

41:47.730 --> 41:49.129
THEY JUST WANT TO TALK TO YOU

41:49.170 --> 41:50.762
FOR A FEW MINUTES.

41:50.800 --> 41:53.735
OFFICERS, I THINK THERE'S BEEN
A HUGE MISUNDERSTANDING.

42:02.080 --> 42:04.617
HER CAR'S GONE
AND SHE'S NOT IN THE BARN.

42:04.650 --> 42:08.689
DO YOU BELIEVE
WHAT SHE TOLD YOU?
PART OF IT? ANY OF IT?

42:08.720 --> 42:11.621
ENOUGH OF IT...
FOR NOW.

42:11.660 --> 42:15.721
THEN YOU BELIEVE THAT
SHE DIDN'T KILL WILDEN.

42:15.760 --> 42:18.058
( cell phones chime )

42:20.030 --> 42:22.567
"MELISSA'S GUILTY OF PLENTY,

42:22.600 --> 42:23.760
"BUT SHE'S NOT 'A' MATERIAL.

42:23.800 --> 42:25.665
KISSES."

42:25.710 --> 42:27.666
I'LL CALL EMILY,
YOU CALL HANNA.

42:31.310 --> 42:33.574
OKAY, I DIAL FAST,
BUT I'M NOT THAT GOOD.

42:33.610 --> 42:36.249
HEY. WE KNOW HOW MONA
GOT THE ALI MASK

42:36.280 --> 42:39.044
AND WHO BURNED DOWN THE LODGE.
AT LEAST WE THINK WE DO.

42:42.290 --> 42:43.917
HANNA, WHAT'S WRONG?

42:46.130 --> 42:48.325
I THINK MY MOM KILLED WILDEN,

42:48.360 --> 42:49.998
AND "A" KNOWS IT.

42:55.700 --> 42:57.691
( kettle whistling )
