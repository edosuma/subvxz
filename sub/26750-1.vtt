03:37.927 --> 03:38.719
- Jeffery.

03:39.511 --> 03:40.971
Can you come with me?

03:53.317 --> 03:55.819
Kelsey is in stable
condition right now,

03:55.903 --> 03:58.197
but it is touch
and go from here.

03:58.280 --> 04:00.616
Her vitals are fading fast.

04:00.699 --> 04:03.494
The cancer cells have
become metastatic.

04:03.577 --> 04:06.830
And the chemotherapy
has no effect.

04:06.914 --> 04:08.415
Her body is unresponsive.

04:12.628 --> 04:16.507
Jeffery, we are keeping her
heavily sedated right now

04:16.589 --> 04:18.634
so she doesn't feel any pain.

04:18.716 --> 04:20.886
But in a couple hours
it will wear off.

04:22.346 --> 04:24.473
You need to make a decision
before it's too late.

04:26.016 --> 04:27.101
I know it's difficult

04:27.893 --> 04:29.603
I'm a father too.

04:29.687 --> 04:32.523
But I wouldn't want
my child to suffer.

04:32.606 --> 04:35.734
She's fighting, but her
body can't take much more.

04:38.737 --> 04:40.197
- Can I see her?

04:40.280 --> 04:42.157
- Of course, come with me.

04:54.586 --> 04:55.462
- Hi sweetie.

04:57.047 --> 04:58.048
It's me Daddy.

04:59.967 --> 05:01.260
Are you ready to go home?

05:05.681 --> 05:06.682
You know I love you.

05:07.808 --> 05:09.143
And mommy loves you too.

05:11.353 --> 05:12.771
I'm sorry she couldn't be here.

05:14.648 --> 05:15.691
But I'm here.

05:29.246 --> 05:32.583
- Mr. Douglas, she
needs her rest now.

05:49.058 --> 05:51.894
- I'm sorry, we did
all we could do.

supposed to be drinkin'.

- What's it been,
two years since ya--

11:37.197 --> 11:37.948
- Three!

11:39.116 --> 11:40.450
- What, ever since
she died you--

11:40.534 --> 11:41.910
- Don't even say it.

11:46.331 --> 11:47.833
Why don't you have some cake.

12:44.389 --> 12:46.349
- So, what are
doing here Jeffery?

12:47.851 --> 12:50.645
- I figured we needed
a day for ourselves.

12:50.729 --> 12:51.897
- Ourselves, huh.

12:53.523 --> 12:55.942
- You know with work and school.

12:56.026 --> 12:57.235
We just needed a day for us.

12:58.028 --> 12:59.196
- Day for us.

13:00.197 --> 13:01.740
Are you trying to seduce me?

13:02.991 --> 13:05.744
- Now why would I go and
do a thing like that.

13:05.827 --> 13:07.537
- I know how you are.

13:09.456 --> 13:10.749
- You think you know who I am.

13:10.832 --> 13:11.708
But you don't.

13:11.791 --> 13:14.085
I'm full of surprises.

13:14.169 --> 13:16.087
- Yeah, I know what
you're full of.

13:17.339 --> 13:18.507
- Really Jennifer?

13:18.590 --> 13:19.966
Really?

13:20.050 --> 13:21.259
- Yes really.

13:22.928 --> 13:24.930
It's a really nice day though.

13:47.827 --> 13:49.412
- Have I told you how
beautiful you look today?

13:50.372 --> 13:54.000
- Not today, but you could
tell me 100 times, it's okay.

13:57.295 --> 13:59.005
- I have something
important to tell you.

13:59.089 --> 13:59.798
- Uh oh.

13:59.881 --> 14:00.757
Should I be worried?

14:01.758 --> 14:02.801
You've got that face.

14:04.177 --> 14:05.512
- No.

14:09.307 --> 14:12.644
We search all our lives
for that special someone

14:12.727 --> 14:13.853
that we may never find.

14:14.729 --> 14:17.148
But today I believe that I have.

14:19.693 --> 14:21.361
I guess what I'm
trying to say is.

14:22.988 --> 14:24.406
- Oh my God.

14:27.742 --> 14:28.702
Will you marry me?

14:33.999 --> 14:35.083
- Yes!

15:10.869 --> 15:12.162
- Looks familiar doesn't it?

15:15.165 --> 15:17.626
I remember taking that picture.

15:18.752 --> 15:20.337
She's is beautiful isn't she?

15:24.132 --> 15:27.427
It was right after
you proposed to her.

15:30.430 --> 15:32.307
You two were so in love.

15:37.312 --> 15:42.317
Jeffery you have to stop blaming
yourself for what happened.

15:46.404 --> 15:47.822
- I should have been there.

15:49.115 --> 15:51.409
- There was nothing
you could do.

15:51.493 --> 15:54.079
You can't stop God's plan.

15:56.206 --> 15:57.999
It was her time to go.

16:02.462 --> 16:06.424
I stopped by the hospital
the other day to see Kelsey.

16:08.009 --> 16:09.386
How is she doing?

16:11.930 --> 16:13.890
- She's still the same.

16:13.973 --> 16:15.183
No response.

16:15.266 --> 16:16.267
No movement.

16:17.227 --> 16:18.019
No nothing.

16:20.355 --> 16:21.564
She'll pull though.

16:22.816 --> 16:25.402
Just keep your faith Jeffery.

16:25.485 --> 16:27.195
- Faith can't help me.

16:27.278 --> 16:29.614
The doctors say
there's is no hope.

16:29.698 --> 16:31.199
My only hope now is a miracle.

16:32.784 --> 16:35.161
I wish Jennifer was here,
she would know what to do.

16:37.163 --> 16:39.749
- Jeffery, we are here.

16:41.418 --> 16:43.670
And we're all praying for you.

16:45.255 --> 16:46.256
Don't worry.

16:49.175 --> 16:50.593
- I'm not the one who needs it.

17:31.676 --> 17:32.552
- Uncle Jeffery?

17:32.635 --> 17:33.636
- Hey, what's up little buddy.

17:33.720 --> 17:35.263
Are you enjoying your party?

17:35.346 --> 17:36.347
- Yeah.

17:37.474 --> 17:39.017
- I see you got a
lot of presents.

17:39.100 --> 17:40.351
What's your favorite?

17:40.435 --> 17:43.146
- The basketball, I want
to be just like LeBron.

17:43.229 --> 17:45.356
- Really like King James?

17:45.440 --> 17:47.108
You're gonna have
to practice a lot.

17:47.192 --> 17:47.901
- I will.

17:52.405 --> 17:53.573
Uncle Jeffery?

17:55.867 --> 17:57.911
Is Kelsey going to be okay?

17:57.994 --> 18:01.039
Me and mommy went to see
her and she's sleeping.

18:01.122 --> 18:02.040
When will she wake up?

18:02.123 --> 18:03.708
I want to play with her again.

18:08.171 --> 18:13.092
- She's,

18:16.012 --> 18:17.305
she's gonna be all right.

18:18.431 --> 18:20.391
She's just resting right now.

18:20.475 --> 18:23.019
Don't worry she'll
be awake soon.

18:23.102 --> 18:23.895
I promise.

18:23.978 --> 18:24.729
- Okay.

18:25.980 --> 18:28.107
- Brent, Mommy needs you inside.

18:39.744 --> 18:42.121
Look, Annie told
me about Kelsey.

18:44.415 --> 18:46.125
I'm so sorry man.

18:46.209 --> 18:49.712
If there's anything that I can
do you let me know all right.

18:49.796 --> 18:51.589
- Why does everyone
keep saying that?

18:52.507 --> 18:54.425
Don't feel sorry for me.

18:54.509 --> 18:55.593
That's life!

18:55.677 --> 18:57.220
You live and you learn right!

18:59.013 --> 19:01.015
- What's wrong with you, man?

19:01.099 --> 19:03.560
You know, bless her heart,
but ever since Jennifer died,

19:03.643 --> 19:05.937
you've been acting
like a straight.

19:06.020 --> 19:07.188
A straight grouch.

19:08.398 --> 19:10.817
Blaming everyone
for your mistakes.

19:10.900 --> 19:12.318
Feeling sorry for yourself.

19:13.570 --> 19:14.612
You need to grow up.

19:15.446 --> 19:16.990
- That's easy for you to say.

19:17.073 --> 19:19.284
You still have your
wife, your child.

19:19.367 --> 19:20.451
I don't have anything right now!

19:20.535 --> 19:22.078
- You still have
life my brother.

19:22.996 --> 19:24.372
Or at least what's left of it.

19:25.540 --> 19:26.958
- What's life without a family?

19:28.543 --> 19:31.254
You get to come home to
your wife, your child.

19:31.337 --> 19:32.672
I get to go home to a
house full of memories

19:32.755 --> 19:33.965
that I used to have.

19:35.508 --> 19:39.095
- Listen the path we are put
on it's never a straight one.

19:41.139 --> 19:43.474
God puts us on this
earth for a reason.

19:43.558 --> 19:44.809
Everyone has a purpose--

19:44.893 --> 19:47.228
- Don't give that
church stuff right now.

19:47.312 --> 19:49.647
I feel like he's punishing
me for something I did.

19:50.648 --> 19:51.858
- How can you say that?

19:53.151 --> 19:55.278
God blesses us with
life every day.

19:56.446 --> 19:58.489
He can take it away with
the blink of an eye.

19:59.365 --> 20:00.742
- Whatever.

20:00.825 --> 20:03.077
You won't believe
who I ran into today.

20:03.161 --> 20:03.870
- Who?

20:03.953 --> 20:05.538
- Cindy Tate.

20:08.750 --> 20:10.460
- Oh wait, you're serious?

20:10.543 --> 20:11.377
She's in town!

20:12.545 --> 20:14.213
- Yeah, I saw her at a bar.

20:14.297 --> 20:15.840
I meant a restaurant!

20:15.924 --> 20:17.342
I was ordering takeout.

20:18.635 --> 20:19.719
- So, what she say?

20:19.802 --> 20:20.970
- She gave me her number,

20:21.054 --> 20:23.389
said she wanted to
catch up or something.

20:23.473 --> 20:25.141
Better than what I'm doin' now.

20:26.893 --> 20:29.228
- You're not seriously
thinkin' about that are you?

20:29.312 --> 20:30.438
- Why not?

20:30.521 --> 20:33.441
She's free, she's a
woman and she's sexy.

20:33.524 --> 20:36.110
- Yeah, She is also bad news.

20:36.194 --> 20:37.946
You know why Annie don't
talk to her anymore.

20:38.029 --> 20:38.696
- No.

20:38.780 --> 20:40.365
Why?

20:40.448 --> 20:42.492
- She slept with her Sally's
husband, what's his name?

20:42.575 --> 20:43.409
- Carl?

20:43.493 --> 20:45.411
- Yeah, she slept with Carl.

20:45.495 --> 20:47.914
That's the reason why
they got a divorce.

20:47.997 --> 20:50.500
Left Sally with
the mortgage, kids.

20:50.583 --> 20:52.669
Not to mention she
sleeps with everybody.

20:53.878 --> 20:55.588
- So, what do I have to lose.

20:58.424 --> 20:59.968
- Wow, your dignity!

21:02.470 --> 21:04.055
Hell I'm lonely tonight.

21:08.184 --> 21:12.271
- I'm telling
you man, she's the devil.

21:13.564 --> 21:14.440
Be careful!

21:16.484 --> 21:20.363
You play with fire you'll
definitely get burned.

21:28.454 --> 21:29.247
Annie!

22:20.465 --> 22:24.052
- Can we go down,
and that one has to wait.

22:24.135 --> 22:25.470
- Well how do you
get it to go down?

22:25.553 --> 22:27.555
- And you have to wait
- And corn is also

22:27.638 --> 22:29.640
- til they go down.
- on the straight.

22:29.724 --> 22:33.436
Oh my gosh, look, I just
got a dairy machine!

22:33.519 --> 22:35.521
So I can make like
yogurt and stuff!

22:35.605 --> 22:37.273
- Okay, so that's how
you make more money.

22:37.356 --> 22:38.357
- Uh huh.
- Okay.

22:38.441 --> 22:39.609
- Sorry babe, game's on.
- A lot, a lot more.

22:39.692 --> 22:40.943
- Thanks sweetie, okay.
- Hi Daddy.

22:41.027 --> 22:42.528
- What's up buddy.

22:42.612 --> 22:45.573
- Okay so then if the two
red ones touch, right.

22:45.656 --> 22:46.407
- Yeah.

22:47.617 --> 22:48.826
- You want
to go play tag?

22:48.910 --> 22:50.244
- Yeah.

22:50.328 --> 22:51.287
- All right.

22:53.414 --> 22:54.415
- C'mon man.

22:55.500 --> 22:57.960
- Cheaters bee.
- I got you, I got you.

22:58.044 --> 23:00.129
- No you don't.
- Brent!

23:00.213 --> 23:02.340
- No you don't.

23:02.423 --> 23:04.801
- Here

23:04.884 --> 23:06.344
- Brent!
- Yes Dad.

23:06.427 --> 23:08.221
- You and Kelsey go
outside and play.

23:08.304 --> 23:09.722
- Okay.

23:09.806 --> 23:11.307
- You two be careful okay?

23:11.390 --> 23:12.600
- Okay Mom.
- Okay.

23:12.683 --> 23:13.643
- All right.

23:17.980 --> 23:19.565
Honey I want to
make dinner, okay?

23:19.649 --> 23:20.358
- Okay.

23:20.441 --> 23:21.400
- All right.

23:23.611 --> 23:24.654
- Got you!

23:27.949 --> 23:29.534
- Kelsey, you okay?

23:30.576 --> 23:33.579
- Yeah.
- Okay, let's go and play.

24:00.565 --> 24:02.567
- So where we spending
Thanksgiving this year?

24:02.650 --> 24:04.318
Your parent's house?

24:04.402 --> 24:07.989
- Well, my parents
are taking a cruise.

24:09.115 --> 24:09.907
- Yeah?

24:11.367 --> 24:12.660
Maybe we should go too.

24:14.704 --> 24:15.872
- I don't know.

24:15.955 --> 24:18.124
Thanksgiving on a cruise?

24:18.207 --> 24:20.585
That's not how I imagine things.

24:20.668 --> 24:22.628
I want to keep our
family tradition,

24:22.712 --> 24:24.839
family time at the holidays.

24:24.922 --> 24:27.508
I want Brent to be
close to his family.

24:29.177 --> 24:31.470
- No.

24:35.725 --> 24:37.685
- I just want to invite Jeffery
and Kelsey over, you know.

24:37.768 --> 24:40.688
He's been so tore up
ever since Jennifer died.

24:40.771 --> 24:43.316
Haven't really been
around family much.

24:43.399 --> 24:44.734
It might do him some good.

24:46.194 --> 24:47.820
- Got you!

24:59.248 --> 24:59.999
Kelsey?

25:00.082 --> 25:00.917
Kelsey!

25:01.000 --> 25:01.751
Are you dead?

25:01.834 --> 25:02.877
Kelsey!

25:02.960 --> 25:04.295
Kelsey, wake up!

25:04.378 --> 25:05.087
Mom!

25:05.171 --> 25:06.339
Somebody help!

25:09.759 --> 25:11.052
- I don't know,

25:11.135 --> 25:14.347
he's always so depressed
when he comes over here.

25:16.224 --> 25:17.934
He just needs to let go.

25:18.017 --> 25:21.312
I feel like he's blamin'
himself for what happened.

25:22.939 --> 25:24.982
- Sweetheart, you
have to understand

25:25.066 --> 25:28.861
that when a man loses his
wife, he's never whole.

25:28.945 --> 25:31.739
She's the backbone
of the relationship.

25:31.822 --> 25:34.075
I mean, how do you think
I'd feel if I lost you?

25:35.660 --> 25:40.498
- Well, besides not having
someone to cook and clean.

25:41.332 --> 25:42.833
I believe you'll be just fine.

25:42.917 --> 25:46.295
- Oh, you got jokes.

25:48.756 --> 25:49.674
- Mommy, Mommy!

25:49.757 --> 25:50.758
Kelsey, fell, she's
not breathing!

25:50.841 --> 25:52.051
- What!

25:52.134 --> 25:53.719
- Come on!

25:56.806 --> 25:57.556
- Kelsey!

25:57.640 --> 25:58.683
Kelsey, Kelsey!

25:58.766 --> 25:59.976
Kelsey, wake up!

26:00.059 --> 26:00.768
She's not breathing.

26:00.851 --> 26:02.061
Call an ambulance.

26:02.144 --> 26:03.396
Brent, go get some
water, hurry up.

26:03.479 --> 26:04.647
Kelsey, Kelsey, wake
up sweetie, wake up.

26:04.730 --> 26:05.731
Please, Kelsey.

26:05.815 --> 26:07.650
- Hello, I
need an ambulance.

26:07.733 --> 26:09.568
- Kelsey, Kelsey.

26:09.652 --> 26:11.487
- 904 Southeast
Hinch Street.

27:11.380 --> 27:13.591
- Friday 1:24 p.m.

27:14.842 --> 27:16.552
- Jeffery,
this is Captain Stewart,

27:16.635 --> 27:19.013
the Fire Chief needs
to see you immediately.

27:20.306 --> 27:22.016
- It's
Stacy from Julian's.

27:22.099 --> 27:23.934
I'd love to hear from you.

27:24.810 --> 27:25.895
- Jeffery, something
happened to Kelsey,

27:25.978 --> 27:26.854
we're in the hospital.

27:26.937 --> 27:27.688
Get over here, right now.

27:58.010 --> 28:00.554
I went to the park and I
seen her on the ground.

28:00.638 --> 28:01.389
I panicked.

28:02.807 --> 28:03.891
I didn't know what to do.

28:05.184 --> 28:06.102
- Jeffery.

28:10.689 --> 28:11.857
- Take care man.

28:25.663 --> 28:27.665
- I don't know how
else to say this,

28:27.748 --> 28:29.083
but Kelsey has Leukemia.

28:31.794 --> 28:32.586
- What is that?

28:33.754 --> 28:35.047
- It's a type of
cancer of the blood

28:35.131 --> 28:37.967
where there is an abnormal
increase in white blood cells.

28:40.845 --> 28:42.304
- How did she get it?

28:42.388 --> 28:45.558
- As with any form of
cancer, it's unknown.

28:48.561 --> 28:49.437
- Is there a cure?

28:51.147 --> 28:53.983
- There are various
treatments we can try.

28:54.066 --> 28:56.735
But with any medicine
there will be risks.

29:00.739 --> 29:01.949
- Is she gonna make it?

29:03.909 --> 29:05.119
- Let's hope for the best.

29:54.251 --> 29:55.544
- Hello?

29:55.628 --> 29:56.378
- Hi, Cindy?

29:58.255 --> 30:00.758
Yeah, it's me
Jeffery from earlier.

30:00.841 --> 30:02.510
- Oh, hey Jeffery, what's up.

30:04.011 --> 30:06.096
- I was in your area and I
thought maybe we could go out

30:06.180 --> 30:07.473
for a drink or something.

30:08.849 --> 30:10.768
- Um, sure, that's great.

30:10.851 --> 30:12.686
There's a place right
by where I live.

30:14.188 --> 30:15.606
- What's the address?

30:15.689 --> 30:17.566
- It's 102 Impines.

30:19.026 --> 30:21.278
- Sounds familiar, I
think I know where it is.

30:21.362 --> 30:23.614
Is 9:30 okay for you?

30:23.697 --> 30:25.616
- 9:30 is great.

30:25.699 --> 30:27.952
- Okay, I'll see you in a few.

30:28.869 --> 30:30.371
- Okay, bye.

30:30.454 --> 30:31.205
- Bye.

31:21.589 --> 31:23.257
- Hello sir, how are you?

31:23.340 --> 31:24.550
- I'm fine.

31:24.633 --> 31:26.218
- That's good to hear.

31:26.302 --> 31:28.220
Today our special is roast
beef with steamed veggies,

31:28.304 --> 31:30.180
would you like
anything to drink?

31:30.264 --> 31:31.098
- No, not right now.

31:31.181 --> 31:33.058
Actually, I'm meeting
somebody here.

31:33.142 --> 31:33.809
Thank you though.

31:33.892 --> 31:35.144
- You're welcome.

31:59.585 --> 32:00.544
- Hey.

32:05.507 --> 32:08.260
I haven't had someone do that
for me since grade school.

32:10.095 --> 32:10.846
- What's that?

32:12.973 --> 32:14.099
- Pull out a chair for me.

32:15.267 --> 32:16.477
- Well I'm a gentleman.

32:17.978 --> 32:18.854
- Hm that's funny.

32:20.356 --> 32:21.357
- Why is that funny?

32:22.983 --> 32:25.110
- I always thought
of you as a bad boy.

32:25.194 --> 32:26.320
Some kind of a rebel.

32:27.446 --> 32:29.740
- Well tonight I'm
whatever you want me to be.

32:30.699 --> 32:31.492
- Really.

32:33.869 --> 32:35.454
- What would you like?

32:35.537 --> 32:37.539
- Actually we'll start
off with some wine.

32:46.382 --> 32:49.635
- Honey, I have some
important news to tell you.

32:49.718 --> 32:51.261
- Jennifer?

32:51.345 --> 32:52.596
- I'm pregnant.

32:52.680 --> 32:54.014
- What!

32:54.098 --> 32:55.683
- I took a test and
it came out positive,

32:55.766 --> 32:58.185
so I went to the doctor
and I'm pregnant.

32:58.268 --> 32:59.186
- How's that possible!

32:59.269 --> 33:00.479
- I hope it's a girl!

33:03.148 --> 33:06.318
I'm so happy, I'm
gonna be a Mommy.

33:06.402 --> 33:07.319
- Jennifer.

33:07.403 --> 33:08.612
- Everybody's gonna
be so excited.

33:08.696 --> 33:09.571
- Jennifer, it's me Jeffery.

33:11.281 --> 33:12.241
- Really!

33:12.324 --> 33:13.158
- I'm gonna be a father?

33:14.243 --> 33:15.035
That's amazing.

33:16.412 --> 33:17.788
Let's celebrate.

33:19.164 --> 33:19.915
I'm gonna be a father!

33:22.334 --> 33:23.794
I love you so much.

33:33.554 --> 33:34.304
- Jeffery.

33:35.472 --> 33:36.223
- What.

33:36.306 --> 33:37.266
- Jeffery.

33:37.349 --> 33:38.308
Are you okay.

33:38.392 --> 33:39.893
- Sir, do you need
some more time?

33:45.899 --> 33:47.192
- That's fine, I'll order.

33:47.276 --> 33:49.528
Can we get a bottle of
the house wine please.

33:52.364 --> 33:53.157
- I,

33:54.116 --> 33:55.576
- Are you sure you're okay?

33:57.035 --> 33:59.955
- I, I'm just hungry.

34:00.038 --> 34:00.914
Excuse me a minute.

34:41.955 --> 34:45.083
- So, are you still
at the fire house?

34:46.168 --> 34:47.628
- No, not any more.

34:47.710 --> 34:48.920
- Why not?

34:49.004 --> 34:51.130
- Something stupid
happened and I quit.

34:52.049 --> 34:53.175
It just wasn't for me.

34:55.260 --> 34:56.219
- Interesting.

34:59.681 --> 35:00.641
- Yeah it is.

35:17.324 --> 35:18.033
I heard you were a bad girl.

35:19.284 --> 35:20.786
- And I'm good at it too.

35:47.396 --> 35:48.897
- Jennifer.

35:48.981 --> 35:50.232
Missed you honey.

35:50.315 --> 35:51.608
- Huh?

35:51.692 --> 35:52.734
What?

35:52.818 --> 35:53.777
- Jennifer!

35:53.861 --> 35:54.695
- Get off me.

35:55.571 --> 35:56.613
- Why'd you leave me.
- You're hurting me.

35:57.698 --> 35:59.616
- Jennifer.
- Get off!

36:00.492 --> 36:01.493
You're hurting me.

36:11.461 --> 36:12.880
- What was that for!

36:12.963 --> 36:15.048
- You called me Jennifer!

36:15.132 --> 36:15.883
- What!

36:16.717 --> 36:17.718
- I'm not your wife!

36:20.971 --> 36:21.763
Leave.

36:22.890 --> 36:23.682
- I'm sorry.

36:23.765 --> 36:24.766
- Get out.

36:24.850 --> 36:25.559
- I can't do this.

36:25.642 --> 36:26.643
- Get out!

36:26.727 --> 36:28.312
- I can't.

39:10.682 --> 39:12.309
- Jennifer.

39:12.392 --> 39:13.185
- In the bathroom.

39:30.285 --> 39:34.039
Honey, so I was thinking that
maybe we should celebrate

39:34.122 --> 39:35.665
New's Year Eve
here at the house.

39:38.418 --> 39:39.294
What do you think?

39:45.425 --> 39:46.343
What are you doing?

39:49.554 --> 39:50.806
- I have
to work today.

39:52.432 --> 39:53.850
- I can't believe you Jeffery.

39:53.934 --> 39:56.228
It's Christmas Eve, why
do you have to work.

39:57.562 --> 39:58.939
- I have too.

39:59.022 --> 39:59.981
It's not my call.

40:01.108 --> 40:02.150
- It's not your call?

40:02.234 --> 40:03.527
You promised me a few weeks ago

40:03.610 --> 40:05.654
that we would spend
Christmas Eve together.

40:05.737 --> 40:07.823
Now you're going
back on your word.

40:07.906 --> 40:09.074
- Don't start with this,

40:09.157 --> 40:10.408
you know I don't
need this right now.

40:10.492 --> 40:12.077
I'm this close to
becoming Captain.

40:14.412 --> 40:15.705
- That's all you
think about now.

40:15.789 --> 40:17.958
Your precious job.

40:18.041 --> 40:20.669
You haven't even been to
any of our lamaze classes.

40:21.628 --> 40:22.921
- You think I don't
want to be there?

40:23.004 --> 40:24.422
I'm doin' this for us.

40:25.549 --> 40:27.801
Me, you, our daughter.

40:27.884 --> 40:29.553
So we can have a better life.

40:30.470 --> 40:32.514
- I don't want a better life.

40:35.183 --> 40:36.935
I just want my husband.

40:49.489 --> 40:51.449
- Look, I have to go.

40:51.533 --> 40:53.743
I'll see you when I get home.

42:53.363 --> 42:54.864
- It's gonna be okay.

42:54.948 --> 42:56.866
- I need Jeffery.

42:58.285 --> 42:59.494
My husband.

43:01.454 --> 43:03.248
I need my husband.

43:06.960 --> 43:08.712
- I need to call, I need phone.

43:11.172 --> 43:13.508
Just let me call him please.

43:14.759 --> 43:16.970
- Concentrate on your breathing.

43:17.053 --> 43:18.972
You're doing good.

43:19.055 --> 43:21.182
That's good, that's good.

43:41.870 --> 43:42.996
- Not answering!

43:48.752 --> 43:51.880
Please, you need to
get ahold of him.

44:01.514 --> 44:02.265
- Where is she?

44:02.349 --> 44:03.558
Where is she?

44:03.641 --> 44:06.269
- Sir, calm down, who
are you looking for?

44:06.353 --> 44:07.020
- My wife.

44:07.103 --> 44:08.772
She's in labor.

44:08.855 --> 44:09.898
- What's her name.

44:09.981 --> 44:13.026
- Jennifer, Jennifer Douglas.

44:13.109 --> 44:15.653
- Mr. Douglas your
wife is in room 212.

44:15.737 --> 44:17.906
Um, Dr. Clark this
is Mr. Douglas.

44:17.989 --> 44:18.990
- Mr. Douglas follow me.

44:19.074 --> 44:20.700
We're prepping her
now for delivery.

44:20.784 --> 44:22.952
Down here on the left hand side.

44:23.036 --> 44:24.287
- Don't worry Jennifer,
you're gonna do great.

44:24.371 --> 44:25.663
- Jeffery, please,
I need my husband.

44:25.747 --> 44:26.748
- Her blood pressures
160 over 100.

44:26.831 --> 44:27.874
- Where's Jeffery?

44:27.957 --> 44:29.000
- All right guys,
how's she doin'?

44:29.084 --> 44:30.293
- My husband, please.

44:30.377 --> 44:32.921
- Jennifer, he'll
be right here okay.

44:34.047 --> 44:35.340
- Ready?

44:35.423 --> 44:36.633
- How far is she dilated?
- Where's my husband.

44:36.716 --> 44:37.926
- I need my husband.
- He'll be right here.

44:38.009 --> 44:39.761
- Baby you made it.
- I'm here.

44:39.844 --> 44:41.054
- All right Jennifer,
this is the hard part.

44:41.137 --> 44:41.846
Ready?

44:41.930 --> 44:43.098
Push.

44:49.104 --> 44:49.979
Push.

44:50.063 --> 44:51.398
Come on Jennifer.

44:57.654 --> 44:59.572
One more push, give
me one more push.

45:02.325 --> 45:05.412
All right Jennifer,
here she comes.

45:05.495 --> 45:07.455
Here she comes.

47:18.253 --> 47:19.254
- You just gotta have faith.

47:19.337 --> 47:21.214
Everything's gonna be all right

47:23.466 --> 47:26.094
You just gotta have faith.

47:26.177 --> 47:27.345
- Jeffery, Bobby.

47:28.221 --> 47:29.222
- Where is she.

47:29.305 --> 47:30.473
- Jeffery, I need
to tell you something.

47:30.557 --> 47:31.349
- Where's my wife?

47:32.433 --> 47:33.977
- This isn't easy.

47:34.060 --> 47:35.937
But your wife is dying.

47:36.020 --> 47:36.771
- What?

47:38.147 --> 47:40.108
- She suffered a complication
during her delivery.

47:40.191 --> 47:41.568
and is bleeding internally.

47:42.735 --> 47:43.987
She's already lost
a lot of blood

47:44.070 --> 47:46.030
and we are unable to stop it.

47:46.114 --> 47:48.116
I ordered a blood
transfusion for her.

47:48.199 --> 47:51.619
But her blood platelets are
low and will eventually fail.

47:51.703 --> 47:53.746
Her organs are
beginning to shut down.

47:53.830 --> 47:55.331
And she is becoming very weak.

47:57.917 --> 47:59.127
- She was fine yesterday,

47:59.210 --> 48:00.044
I need to see her!

48:01.087 --> 48:04.173
I'm sorry, we did
all we could do.

48:04.257 --> 48:08.177
Right now, just be
with her, comfort her.

48:10.680 --> 48:12.098
- I need to see her.
- It's gonna be okay.

48:12.181 --> 48:16.060
All right we're here for
ya, it's gonna be all right.

48:29.032 --> 48:30.116
- Where's Kelsey?

48:34.120 --> 48:35.288
- She's in the nursery.

48:36.748 --> 48:38.124
- Why are you crying?

48:44.672 --> 48:46.049
- It's gonna be okay.

48:47.175 --> 48:49.010
Doctor said I'm gonna be fine.

48:51.304 --> 48:52.305
- No.

48:55.183 --> 48:56.184
- Jeffery.

48:56.267 --> 48:57.018
Look at me.

48:59.062 --> 48:59.854
Look at me.

49:01.648 --> 49:03.483
I need you to do
something for me.

49:05.109 --> 49:06.194
Promise?

49:14.160 --> 49:15.578
I want you live.

49:18.081 --> 49:19.248
For our daughter.

49:20.708 --> 49:22.418
I know you're gonna
be a great Dad.

49:33.763 --> 49:36.516
You don't have to take
care of me anymore.

49:36.599 --> 49:37.725
I have God now.

49:40.853 --> 49:44.607
If you ever need me,
I'll be right here.

49:54.200 --> 49:56.160
- Don't go.

49:57.120 --> 49:57.912
Don't go.

50:03.042 --> 50:03.793
Don't go.

52:05.122 --> 52:06.541
Kelsey.

52:06.624 --> 52:07.375
Kelsey!

52:12.129 --> 52:12.880
What happened?

52:30.273 --> 52:31.399
- I'm sorry Jeffery.

52:57.133 --> 52:58.384
- Kelsey, sweetie.

53:17.278 --> 53:20.114
Did I ever tell you the story
about how I met your Mom?

53:20.197 --> 53:20.948
- No Daddy.

53:23.784 --> 53:25.411
- It was my first
year in college.

53:27.747 --> 53:29.373
I was taking a math class.

53:31.500 --> 53:32.460
Then she walked in.

53:34.545 --> 53:35.630
She was so beautiful.

53:37.715 --> 53:39.342
She wore a white dress

53:40.635 --> 53:43.387
and she had long black
hair, just like you.

53:45.431 --> 53:50.436
And I knew right then and there,
we were gonna be together.

53:51.103 --> 53:53.064
So I asked her out.

53:53.356 --> 53:54.398
She said, no at first.

53:55.608 --> 53:56.609
But that didn't stop me.

53:58.653 --> 54:00.571
So I made her a promise.

54:00.655 --> 54:02.365
I said, if you give me a chance,

54:03.407 --> 54:06.160
I promise I will
always love you.

54:08.120 --> 54:10.456
And that's the same promise
I'm gonna make to you.

54:13.751 --> 54:16.837
I promise that I
will never leave you.

54:19.340 --> 54:20.424
I miss your Mom too.

54:21.717 --> 54:24.261
But I get to see her
every single day,

54:25.846 --> 54:30.851
she has your eyes, she has
your nose, and your smile.

54:34.605 --> 54:37.191
So anytime you ever
want to see her

54:38.985 --> 54:41.612
all you have to do is
look in the mirror.

54:46.951 --> 54:48.160
- I love you Daddy.

54:49.620 --> 54:50.663
- I love you too.

55:01.048 --> 55:02.842
- I understand, I'm on it, okay.

55:02.925 --> 55:04.427
Yeah, okay.

55:04.510 --> 55:06.345
Yeah, and that's affirmative.

55:06.429 --> 55:07.930
Jeffery.

55:08.014 --> 55:09.890
Jeffery, I'm dealing with
the situation right now.

55:10.850 --> 55:11.642
Yeah.

55:14.562 --> 55:16.647
Yes, right.

55:17.565 --> 55:18.983
Yes.

55:19.066 --> 55:20.609
That's affirmative.

55:20.693 --> 55:22.028
Yeah, okay.

55:22.111 --> 55:22.862
Jeffery.

55:27.700 --> 55:29.660
- You wanted to see me sir?

55:29.744 --> 55:30.494
- Yes.

55:31.704 --> 55:33.164
It's been brought
to my attention

55:33.247 --> 55:35.416
that you haven't been
performing up to our standards

55:35.499 --> 55:36.834
and the city is
cracking down on us

55:36.917 --> 55:38.711
and we have to make some cuts.

55:40.504 --> 55:42.173
- What are you talking about?

55:42.256 --> 55:44.550
- I'm talking about
your last call?

55:44.633 --> 55:46.677
- What do you mean my last call?

55:46.761 --> 55:48.012
- The fire we put out last week?

55:48.095 --> 55:49.472
You remember that?

55:49.555 --> 55:50.765
You nearly killed that lady.

55:52.058 --> 55:53.350
And you put Jordan in danger

55:53.434 --> 55:54.810
with that little stunt
you pulled, all right.

55:54.894 --> 55:57.104
Now you didn't go by
the book on that call.

55:57.188 --> 55:57.897
You know that.

55:57.980 --> 55:58.981
You acted irresponsibly.

56:01.609 --> 56:02.568
No, I don't want to hear it.

56:02.651 --> 56:03.569
Listen.

56:03.652 --> 56:04.945
There's no room for
that in this department,

56:05.029 --> 56:06.572
do you understand me?

56:06.655 --> 56:07.907
- Sir.

56:07.990 --> 56:09.867
- No, and now the woman is
sueing the city for millions.

56:10.826 --> 56:12.203
- I saved that lady.

56:13.204 --> 56:14.455
- I don't see it that way.

56:14.538 --> 56:17.416
And I don't want to
hear any excuses.

56:20.920 --> 56:23.631
- Chief, I haven't been
the same since my wife died

56:23.714 --> 56:25.049
and now my daughter's
in the hospital.

56:25.132 --> 56:26.550
- Look, I' sorry
about your situation,

56:26.634 --> 56:28.302
okay, I truly am, all right.

56:28.385 --> 56:31.722
But, you've become a problem.

56:31.806 --> 56:34.225
All right, I can't have you
jeapordizing this department

56:34.308 --> 56:35.810
with your
irresponsible behavior.

56:37.311 --> 56:39.772
You're bringing negative
attention on us, all right.

56:41.732 --> 56:42.566
I have to let you go.

56:44.276 --> 56:47.988
- Chief, this is my
life, this is my job.

56:48.072 --> 56:48.906
I have nothing.

56:50.241 --> 56:52.868
- I'm sorry, but you have to go.

56:52.952 --> 56:54.036
Clean out your locker.

57:13.764 --> 57:15.724
- Sir, you're makin'
a huge mistake.

57:15.808 --> 57:16.976
Jeffery's one of the best

57:17.059 --> 57:19.061
if not the best fire
fighter in this department.

57:20.229 --> 57:21.772
- My decision is final.

57:21.856 --> 57:24.525
Listen he put us all at risk
with that stunt he pulled.

57:24.608 --> 57:26.569
Okay, we work by the book.

57:26.652 --> 57:27.611
That's how you were trained.

57:27.695 --> 57:30.030
All right, now he
acted irresponsibly

57:30.114 --> 57:31.782
with that crazy
little stunt he pulled

57:31.866 --> 57:33.492
and he damned near
got a woman killed.

57:33.576 --> 57:35.786
I will not have that
on my conscience.

57:35.870 --> 57:37.121
- Sir, with all due respect

57:37.204 --> 57:38.998
you know damn well you would
have done the same thing

57:39.081 --> 57:40.457
if you was in his situation.

57:41.167 --> 57:41.959
- Bobby.

57:43.794 --> 57:44.753
- Chief.

57:44.837 --> 57:47.631
Look, we can't fire Jeffery man.

57:47.715 --> 57:48.632
We need him.

57:48.716 --> 57:50.718
There has to be
something we can do.

57:50.801 --> 57:52.803
Call the Mayor, something.

57:52.887 --> 57:54.597
We really need him.

57:54.680 --> 57:57.224
- The decision has been
made and it's final.

57:58.434 --> 57:59.310
Get back to work.

58:03.397 --> 58:05.107
- So it's like that.

58:05.191 --> 58:05.941
- Yes.

58:32.635 --> 58:33.844
- You left me!

58:35.346 --> 58:36.889
What am I supposed to do now!

59:22.726 --> 59:23.560
I'm ready.

59:38.158 --> 59:39.702
- Jeffery,
where are you man?

59:39.785 --> 59:41.870
I've been tryin' to
reach you all night.

59:41.954 --> 59:44.206
Look Kelsey's vital
signs are failing,

59:44.290 --> 59:46.333
the doctors need a decision.

59:46.417 --> 59:47.543
We're at the hospital.

01:00:19.783 --> 01:00:21.827
- Have
you been drinkin'?

01:00:25.956 --> 01:00:28.834
- She'll pull
through, she'll pull through.

01:00:32.254 --> 01:00:34.631
- You need to make a
decision before it's to late.

01:00:45.893 --> 01:00:49.104
- Promise,
promise, promise.

01:01:03.660 --> 01:01:05.371
- But I can tell you

01:01:05.454 --> 01:01:08.123
these things is just
a day by day thing.

01:01:08.207 --> 01:01:09.625
You know, you don't,
can't really tell.

01:01:09.708 --> 01:01:10.584
- What's goin' on?

01:01:10.667 --> 01:01:11.502
- Jeff where have you been?

01:01:11.585 --> 01:01:12.920
- Excuse me for one second.

01:01:13.003 --> 01:01:15.714
I've been calling you man,
why haven't you answered.

01:01:16.715 --> 01:01:17.800
They need a decision.

01:01:17.883 --> 01:01:18.926
- A decision on what?

01:01:20.761 --> 01:01:21.553
- On Kelsey.

01:01:24.973 --> 01:01:26.809
Look, I'm sorry man.

01:01:28.018 --> 01:01:30.229
I know you're in a
difficult situation,

01:01:30.312 --> 01:01:31.522
and we all feel for you.

01:01:32.856 --> 01:01:34.358
But she's sufferin'.

01:01:36.026 --> 01:01:37.194
You got to let her go man.

01:01:39.071 --> 01:01:40.572
- That's easy for you to say.

01:01:40.656 --> 01:01:42.616
You still have your
wife, your child.

01:01:42.699 --> 01:01:43.951
What do I have?

01:01:44.034 --> 01:01:45.077
- You still have your life.

01:01:45.160 --> 01:01:46.328
- This will change everything.

01:01:46.412 --> 01:01:48.956
- Jeff, what the, what
are you doing man.

01:01:49.039 --> 01:01:50.999
Jeff, what are you doin'?

01:01:51.083 --> 01:01:53.460
Jeffery, stop, please stop.

01:01:53.544 --> 01:01:55.504
Jeffery, listen to me.

01:01:57.047 --> 01:01:58.173
Okay.

01:01:58.257 --> 01:01:59.591
You don't have to do this.

01:02:01.718 --> 01:02:02.511
Trust me.

01:02:04.972 --> 01:02:06.140
Just listen to me.

01:02:08.600 --> 01:02:09.935
This is the easy way out.

01:02:12.312 --> 01:02:13.522
You can control it.

01:02:16.108 --> 01:02:17.484
You need to live.

01:02:17.568 --> 01:02:22.114
For your wife and you need
to live for your daughter.

01:02:26.034 --> 01:02:27.327
If you do this.

01:02:29.079 --> 01:02:30.456
You will never see them again.

01:02:34.001 --> 01:02:35.377
You don't want to do this.

01:02:36.211 --> 01:02:37.045
Don't do it.

01:02:38.922 --> 01:02:39.715
Give it to me.

01:02:44.094 --> 01:02:45.179
Come here man.

01:02:53.103 --> 01:02:54.980
It's gonna be all
right, I'm here, okay.

01:02:55.063 --> 01:02:56.732
Me, Annie, we're here.

01:02:58.650 --> 01:03:00.152
It's gonna be all right man.

01:03:23.091 --> 01:03:24.176
- Where are you God!

01:03:26.178 --> 01:03:28.013
You took my wife.

01:03:28.096 --> 01:03:29.806
Now you want my daughter!

01:03:29.890 --> 01:03:31.600
Well you're not gonna get me.

01:04:04.258 --> 01:04:05.050
- Daddy?

01:04:09.304 --> 01:04:10.347
- Kelsey.

01:04:10.430 --> 01:04:11.598
You're awake?

01:04:11.682 --> 01:04:15.060
- Yes, Daddy, I am.

01:04:15.143 --> 01:04:16.228
- Am I dreaming?

01:04:16.311 --> 01:04:18.272
The doctors said
you were gonna die.

01:04:18.355 --> 01:04:19.106
- No Daddy.

01:04:20.607 --> 01:04:22.192
I'm going to live.

01:04:22.276 --> 01:04:23.986
- How do you know that?

01:04:24.069 --> 01:04:25.195
- An angel told me so.

01:04:27.239 --> 01:04:29.575
- Angel, what did they give you?

01:04:31.285 --> 01:04:33.328
- No, Daddy, she's over there.

01:04:38.125 --> 01:04:39.501
- I don't see anything.

01:04:39.585 --> 01:04:44.548
- Daddy, you have to look with
your heart, not your eyes.

01:04:51.096 --> 01:04:51.888
Hi Mommy.

01:04:54.099 --> 01:04:55.892
- How do you know?

01:04:55.976 --> 01:05:00.188
- She has always been with me.

01:05:00.272 --> 01:05:02.816
She has always been in my heart.

01:05:07.321 --> 01:05:09.072
- Why did you leave me?

01:05:09.156 --> 01:05:11.158
I couldn't handle
this all by myself.

01:05:11.241 --> 01:05:13.744
- Jeffery, I never left you.

01:05:13.827 --> 01:05:15.662
You forgot about me.

01:05:15.746 --> 01:05:17.331
I have always been here.

01:05:18.498 --> 01:05:20.792
- No, I thought
about you every day.

01:05:22.127 --> 01:05:24.004
- You lost your
faith when I died

01:05:24.087 --> 01:05:26.882
and you have been blaming
God for it this whole time.

01:05:26.965 --> 01:05:27.716
- No.

01:05:28.675 --> 01:05:30.510
- Yes, you have my love.

01:05:30.594 --> 01:05:32.054
We're all God's children,

01:05:32.137 --> 01:05:34.640
and when He's ready for
us He'll call us back.

01:05:36.308 --> 01:05:38.810
- I didn't mean to, I just,

01:05:41.146 --> 01:05:42.773
I just couldn't
go on without you.

01:05:44.024 --> 01:05:46.276
- That's why he blessed
you with a daughter.

01:05:46.360 --> 01:05:49.488
To remind you of me and
that you have a purpose.

01:05:52.324 --> 01:05:53.700
My time is almost up.

01:05:53.784 --> 01:05:56.161
It's time for you to
reclaim your faith.

01:06:23.939 --> 01:06:24.690
- Help!

01:06:24.773 --> 01:06:25.857
Somebody!

01:06:25.941 --> 01:06:28.110
My daughter's dying!

01:06:28.193 --> 01:06:29.611
- Calm down sir,
where's your daughter?

01:06:29.695 --> 01:06:31.029
- This way.

01:06:37.577 --> 01:06:39.246
- I'm getting no
pulse, compressions.

01:06:39.329 --> 01:06:40.789
- One, two, three, four, five

01:06:40.872 --> 01:06:41.998
- Come on, stay
with me, come on.

01:06:42.082 --> 01:06:44.418
- Six, seven, eight, nine, 10.

01:06:46.002 --> 01:06:48.380
- Still no pulse, no pulse,
compressions, compressions.

01:06:48.463 --> 01:06:50.257
- One, two, three.
- C'mon gotta stay with me.

01:06:50.340 --> 01:06:53.301
- Four, five, six,
seven, eight, nine, 10.

01:06:53.385 --> 01:06:55.971
- I'm, I've got
nothing, compressions.

01:06:56.054 --> 01:06:57.139
- One, two, three,
- Compressions!

01:06:57.222 --> 01:06:58.181
- four, five, six,
- Come on.

01:06:58.265 --> 01:07:00.642
- Seven, eight, nine, 10.

01:07:33.467 --> 01:07:34.843
- Jeff.

01:07:40.307 --> 01:07:41.391
Jeff, Jeff, wait.

01:07:41.475 --> 01:07:42.225
Jeff!

01:07:45.395 --> 01:07:46.521
Sorry, sorry.

01:07:46.605 --> 01:07:48.440
- Jeffery, wait.
- Sorry.

01:07:48.523 --> 01:07:49.733
- What happened?

01:07:49.816 --> 01:07:51.276
- I'm not sure, I'll
come back for you.

01:07:51.359 --> 01:07:52.194
Jeff.

01:08:00.243 --> 01:08:01.369
Jeff!

01:08:01.453 --> 01:08:02.204
Jeff!

01:08:02.287 --> 01:08:03.705
Wait!

01:08:03.789 --> 01:08:04.956
You don't got to do this man!

01:08:05.040 --> 01:08:06.291
- I've lost everything.

01:08:06.374 --> 01:08:08.210
She said she was gonna live.

01:08:08.293 --> 01:08:09.294
- Who?

01:08:09.377 --> 01:08:10.128
- Kelsey!

01:08:12.589 --> 01:08:15.884
- Listen man, she's gone.

01:08:15.967 --> 01:08:17.135
- No, it was real.

01:08:17.219 --> 01:08:17.969
I felt her.

01:08:18.970 --> 01:08:20.639
- Jeff, Jeff, wait.

01:08:22.224 --> 01:08:23.350
It was all in your mind.

01:08:25.143 --> 01:08:26.019
- He's taken 'em.

01:08:26.102 --> 01:08:27.312
He's taken 'em both.

01:08:27.395 --> 01:08:28.313
- Who?

01:08:28.395 --> 01:08:29.397
- God!

01:08:30.273 --> 01:08:31.858
- What are you
talkin' about Jeff!

01:08:32.818 --> 01:08:34.069
- Well he's not gonna get me.

01:08:34.152 --> 01:08:36.238
- Jeff, stop, listen
to me man, listen.

01:08:36.321 --> 01:08:38.323
Listen okay, Jeff,
don't do this!

01:08:38.406 --> 01:08:40.450
Jeff, just listen to me.

01:08:40.533 --> 01:08:41.243
Jeff!

01:08:41.326 --> 01:08:42.452
Listen to me!

01:08:42.536 --> 01:08:43.870
Jeff, don't do this man!

01:08:46.038 --> 01:08:47.332
Watch out!

01:10:16.880 --> 01:10:18.089
- Pull, pull.

01:10:19.966 --> 01:10:21.551
- Compressions.

01:10:21.635 --> 01:10:24.054
- Pressure in the
90s, pressure in the 90s.

01:10:30.518 --> 01:10:31.978
- There's no pulse.

01:10:35.649 --> 01:10:37.817
- Losin' him.

01:10:37.984 --> 01:10:38.693
Got no pulse.

01:10:38.777 --> 01:10:39.986
C'mon.

01:11:28.702 --> 01:11:29.786
- Doctor just got here,
let me call you back.

01:11:29.869 --> 01:11:31.121
- How's Jeffery doin' today?

01:11:32.831 --> 01:11:33.748
- No improvements.

01:11:33.832 --> 01:11:35.333
- Nothing at all?

01:11:35.417 --> 01:11:36.918
- No
improvements at all.

01:11:51.474 --> 01:11:52.475
- Is he gonna be okay?

01:11:52.559 --> 01:11:55.020
- Let's
hope for the best.

01:14:10.488 --> 01:14:11.739
- Where are we going?

01:14:11.823 --> 01:14:12.740
- To live.
