WEBVTT

00:57.190 --> 00:59.526
- You sold us a defective kid.

00:59.592 --> 01:01.461
- He's creepy, and I don't like it,

01:01.561 --> 01:02.629
and we are returning him.

01:02.729 --> 01:04.297
- We do not do returns.

01:04.397 --> 01:05.799
- Well, you're gonna have to,

01:05.899 --> 01:07.801
'cause he scares the shit out of us.

01:07.901 --> 01:09.235
- When you signed our agreement,

01:09.302 --> 01:11.137
you consented to our no-fuss policy.

01:11.237 --> 01:15.809
- Well, we're going to be very vocal about this.

01:15.909 --> 01:17.877
We're going to ruin your life, sir.

01:17.944 --> 01:19.412
- Be my guest.

01:19.479 --> 01:21.915
And the second you do so, we'll let the whole world know

01:21.981 --> 01:24.384
that you illegally trafficked a child

01:24.451 --> 01:27.754
from our offshore facility to New York City.

01:27.821 --> 01:29.155
- We did no such thing!

01:29.255 --> 01:30.590
- We show you the child,

01:30.657 --> 01:32.292
you're responsible for the travel.

01:32.392 --> 01:34.394
That makes you liable.

01:34.461 --> 01:36.463
You disgust me.

01:36.563 --> 01:38.832
- I am going to slander your name at every dinner party

01:38.932 --> 01:41.167
I attend for the next three to five years.

01:41.267 --> 01:43.670
Now, fuck off. Come on, Marc.

01:43.770 --> 01:46.005
What are we gonna do? Can your moms take him?

01:46.106 --> 01:47.407
- I don't want him to kill my moms.

01:47.474 --> 01:49.509
- Mr. Goss, I have a thought.

01:49.609 --> 01:51.611
Could I have a word in private with you, please?

01:55.115 --> 01:57.183
My wife's family just moved in with me,

01:57.283 --> 01:58.985
and they're hideous people.

02:00.120 --> 02:01.855
- Okay. - I can't live with them,

02:01.955 --> 02:03.356
not without a change.

02:03.456 --> 02:05.625
I'm aware of your affiliation

02:05.692 --> 02:09.362
with Mr. Tunnel Quinn and his Lyte Project.

02:09.462 --> 02:12.432
When I checked my Tunnel Box and it was empty,

02:12.499 --> 02:14.367
mm, I wept.

02:15.635 --> 02:16.970
- Sorry, so what are you saying?

02:17.036 --> 02:19.639
- I want my hands on those pills, Mr. Goss,

02:19.706 --> 02:21.207
to give to her family.

02:21.307 --> 02:23.977
I want them to become tolerable people.

02:24.043 --> 02:26.880
I propose we negotiate a trade

02:26.980 --> 02:28.848
between one person who hates this family

02:28.948 --> 02:31.885
and another person who hates his family.

02:31.985 --> 02:33.153
- But the formula isn't gonna be ready

02:33.219 --> 02:35.655
for a long time, years, even.

02:35.722 --> 02:38.158
- No, I can't wait that long, not with their habits.

02:38.224 --> 02:40.627
Just bring me whatever you got at whatever stage it's at,

02:40.693 --> 02:44.197
and hopefully that'll shake something up inside them.

02:44.998 --> 02:47.901
- I honestly cannot go behind my best friend's back

02:48.001 --> 02:49.903
like that, at least not in a way

02:50.003 --> 02:51.571
that could ever get back to her.

02:51.671 --> 02:54.874
- Hey, babe, the babysitter says she can't breathe.

02:57.343 --> 02:58.411
- It's a deal.

02:58.511 --> 02:59.679
- I guess so.

03:01.247 --> 03:02.982
- And you're sure you don't want a hand with all that?

03:03.049 --> 03:05.084
- No, I'm good, I'm good, I'm good.

03:05.185 --> 03:06.486
- And you don't mind at all,

03:06.553 --> 03:08.154
having to do all this ground work?

03:08.221 --> 03:10.590
- It is an honor and a privilege to serve the cause.

03:10.690 --> 03:12.825
- Picking up the dry cleaning is an honor?

03:12.892 --> 03:14.994
- Yes, Drew, I'm happy to do it.

03:15.061 --> 03:16.496
Because if I don't do it, then someone's not gonna

03:16.563 --> 03:18.064
do it right, and I'd rather do it right,

03:18.164 --> 03:19.666
because if I do it, I'll do it right.

03:19.732 --> 03:21.201
- Totally, yeah.

03:22.368 --> 03:23.736
Hey, so how are things going

03:23.836 --> 03:25.538
with that guy you've been seeing?

03:25.605 --> 03:27.774
- Aw!

03:27.874 --> 03:30.777
Really sweet of you to ask.

03:30.877 --> 03:33.613
Things are, you know, progressing in their own way.

03:33.713 --> 03:37.217
Kind of feel like I might actually be in love.

03:37.283 --> 03:38.451
- Oh, my gosh.

03:38.551 --> 03:39.752
- I think they could be the one.

03:39.852 --> 03:41.554
- Aw, congrats, Portia.

03:41.621 --> 03:43.856
That's awesome. - Thanks. I'm so happy.

03:43.923 --> 03:46.359
How are things going with you and your new "relaysh"?

03:46.426 --> 03:48.695
- Oh, I'm just trying to see where this goes

03:48.761 --> 03:50.530
and not put any pressure on it

03:50.597 --> 03:52.899
'cause I've actually done a bad job of that in the past.

03:52.966 --> 03:54.300
- Mm-hmm.

03:54.400 --> 03:58.972
- And I also have a lot of trust issues, so yeah.

03:59.072 --> 04:01.474
- I'm confused.

04:01.574 --> 04:03.076
When do you find the time to see this person?

04:03.142 --> 04:06.713
'Cause I feel like I'm with you all the time.

04:06.779 --> 04:08.381
- Right, yeah.

04:08.448 --> 04:10.149
Well, I could say the same to you.

04:10.250 --> 04:11.618
I guess we just find time.

04:11.718 --> 04:13.753
- What? Isn't that Dory and those guys?

04:13.820 --> 04:16.489
- Oh, my God. - Yeah, looks like it.

04:16.589 --> 04:17.790
- This is not on the schedule.

04:17.890 --> 04:19.659
- Right, yeah, not on the schedule.

04:19.759 --> 04:20.893
- And then they get back together.

04:20.960 --> 04:21.928
- Yeah. - Yeah.

04:21.995 --> 04:23.329
- And then they get, like,

04:23.429 --> 04:25.431
million-dollar presents for each other.

04:25.498 --> 04:28.801
- Hi! - Oh, my gosh. Hi!

04:28.901 --> 04:30.270
Oh, my gosh. This is so great.

04:30.336 --> 04:32.105
Why don't you guys join us? We just ordered.

04:32.171 --> 04:33.406
- Yay, good. Perfect.

04:33.473 --> 04:35.408
I'm so hungry from running around town

04:35.475 --> 04:37.443
trying to keep the business afloat.

04:37.510 --> 04:39.145
- Come join us for brunch, you guys.

04:39.245 --> 04:40.680
- I know what brunch is; I've been having brunch

04:40.780 --> 04:42.582
with Dory for a really long time.

04:42.649 --> 04:45.585
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

04:45.652 --> 04:48.021
- I'll sit down here. - Yeah.

04:48.121 --> 04:50.690
- So, Dory, are you looking for a bloke these days?

04:50.790 --> 04:52.458
'Cause I'm quite close with the son

04:52.525 --> 04:56.095
of the sultan of Fatima, and he has a crush on you.

04:56.162 --> 04:58.531
- Oh, my God, that would be so perfect, really.

04:58.631 --> 04:59.799
- Wow. I mean, I like that.

04:59.866 --> 05:01.367
He obviously has very good taste.

05:01.467 --> 05:04.037
- Can I show him to you? He's quite lush.

05:04.137 --> 05:06.839
Full disclosure, we did snog back in, like, 2012.

05:06.939 --> 05:09.542
I just want to be up front about that, but...look.

05:09.642 --> 05:12.111
- Oh, wow. Oh, he's very handsome.

05:12.178 --> 05:15.214
- Can I see? - Oh, my God. He's cute.

05:15.315 --> 05:16.883
Come on, Dory. You got to do this, Dory.

05:16.983 --> 05:18.818
You have to. - Yes, that's it.

05:18.885 --> 05:20.653
That's the one. - Wait, does he have a mane?

05:20.720 --> 05:22.655
Oh, my God. I saw a mane.

05:22.722 --> 05:24.157
It's because he has a lion's aura.

05:24.223 --> 05:27.060
That's a king energy. The king wants love.

05:27.160 --> 05:28.294
- But he's royalty.

05:28.361 --> 05:30.029
Why would he be interested in me?

05:30.129 --> 05:32.398
- No, this guy's a loser, this guy.

05:32.498 --> 05:35.068
- And small, 'cause, I mean, he's, what--this guy's 6'.

05:35.168 --> 05:37.036
I mean, I'm 6'5"; I would be so afraid

05:37.136 --> 05:39.138
that I would step on him and squish him.

05:39.205 --> 05:42.041
- They're just jealous. He's so cute, Dor.

05:42.141 --> 05:44.410
- Yeah! - Dor?

05:46.312 --> 05:48.081
- Thank you so much for squeezing me in today.

05:48.181 --> 05:50.717
- Of course. It's a very busy time.

05:50.817 --> 05:52.552
A lot of witness protection happening,

05:52.652 --> 05:55.088
a lot of masquerade balls, for some reason.

05:55.188 --> 05:56.756
So is this for sex?

05:56.856 --> 06:00.493
- No, no. It's for espionage. - Ooh, lovely.

06:00.560 --> 06:03.496
And are we inventing, or do we have a look in mind?

06:03.563 --> 06:06.432
- I need you to make me look like...

06:06.532 --> 06:09.502
this man. - Okay. Let's see here.

06:09.569 --> 06:12.372
Oh, no. This man?

06:12.438 --> 06:13.840
Wouldn't you want to be someone hot?

06:13.906 --> 06:15.408
- I know, I know.

06:15.508 --> 06:16.943
Unfortunately I had to get it from a community shower

06:17.043 --> 06:19.011
for scientists at Tunnel Industries,

06:19.078 --> 06:21.681
so that is the hottest person I could steal from.

06:23.349 --> 06:25.518
- Okay.

06:25.585 --> 06:27.687
We're gonna need a lot of glue.

06:29.021 --> 06:30.456
A lot. - Yeah, yeah, yeah.

06:30.556 --> 06:33.226
- Yeah, so hope you have a week to get it off.

06:33.292 --> 06:34.761
- - Let's see.

06:34.861 --> 06:36.763
All right, let's see what we can do here.

06:37.563 --> 06:40.566
- To the privilege to be able to order beautiful food

06:40.633 --> 06:43.136
and it be placed right in front of us,

06:43.236 --> 06:45.705
to the hard work that went into it,

06:45.772 --> 06:50.410
to every bite and to abundance.

06:51.711 --> 06:53.279
- To Dory. - To Dory.

06:53.379 --> 06:54.447
- To Dory.

06:54.547 --> 06:56.649
- Seriously, though, like, to Dory.

06:56.749 --> 06:59.952
I didn't realize how unhappy I was chasing the boys

07:00.052 --> 07:02.655
and the photo and, like, all this superficial shit.

07:02.755 --> 07:05.224
And, like, I thought that was love.

07:05.291 --> 07:09.095
And now I know love,

07:09.162 --> 07:10.997
and it's with all y'all.

07:11.097 --> 07:13.132
- We're family. That shit's real.

07:13.232 --> 07:14.667
- Yeah, we're like brother and sister.

07:14.767 --> 07:17.303
And, Dory, you're like our mama.

07:17.403 --> 07:19.338
- Dory was like my mama first for many years.

07:19.439 --> 07:22.141
You're all like the stepkids. Bond's not the same.

07:24.277 --> 07:27.447
all:

07:27.513 --> 07:29.348
- You took everything from me!

07:29.449 --> 07:31.651
You ruined my life! - Who's that lady?

07:31.751 --> 07:33.786
- You do the work of Satan, you psychotic freak.

07:33.853 --> 07:35.655
- She's got a knife. - Oh, my God.

07:37.156 --> 07:38.491
- Dory! - That's for him!

07:38.591 --> 07:39.959
You know what you did.

07:40.026 --> 07:42.128
You know what you did! - It's gonna be okay.

07:42.195 --> 07:43.463
We're gonna get you stitched right up.

07:43.529 --> 07:45.698
- Ritchie, move. My God. It's okay, Dory.

07:45.798 --> 07:47.467
I'm here, I'm here. Give her space.

07:47.533 --> 07:49.635
- Ma'am, are you okay? - Yes, yes.

07:49.702 --> 07:51.204
- Did you want to press charges?

07:51.304 --> 07:53.206
We could try to nab her.

07:53.306 --> 07:54.640
- No, no, no. It's all right.

07:54.707 --> 07:56.943
She's obviously in some sort of pain.

07:57.009 --> 07:58.711
- Oh, God. Oh, you're so strong.

07:58.811 --> 08:00.813
- I'm okay. I'm okay. - You're so strong.

08:00.880 --> 08:03.349
Are you okay? - Yeah, I'm fine.

08:03.449 --> 08:07.053
- Can we get some water? - Yeah, do something, guys.

08:10.857 --> 08:14.126
- Wait, where's my clipboard?

08:16.028 --> 08:19.031
Sorry, what are you doing with my clipboard?

08:21.501 --> 08:24.070
- I thought it was a community clipboard.

08:24.170 --> 08:25.671
- No.

08:25.738 --> 08:27.473
And who are you?

08:28.407 --> 08:31.878
- Hello, Dr. Benny. I'm Dr. Carpet.

08:31.978 --> 08:36.249
I'll be in and out of here as the days go by.

08:36.349 --> 08:38.417
- You look familiar to me.

08:40.319 --> 08:43.656
Did we meet at the Saratoga convention?

08:45.558 --> 08:48.861
- We may have. We may have. In fact, yes.

08:48.928 --> 08:50.096
- It's hard to remember.

08:50.196 --> 08:52.398
I get so blackout at those things.

08:52.498 --> 08:54.567
All the chitchat makes me drink.

08:54.667 --> 08:56.068
- Oh. - I'm sorry.

08:56.168 --> 08:59.539
I have to ask something very embarrassing,

08:59.605 --> 09:04.010
but did we...

09:04.076 --> 09:05.945
- Did we what? Did we what?

09:06.045 --> 09:08.748
- You know, uh, in the hot tub

09:08.848 --> 09:10.783
and in the barn,

09:10.883 --> 09:13.019
twice in the barn.

09:13.085 --> 09:16.689
- I was going to be a gentleman and not bring that up, Benny.

09:16.756 --> 09:18.624
- Why, thank you. - You know, can I ask you,

09:18.724 --> 09:20.226
though-- I'd love to know more

09:20.293 --> 09:22.261
about the Lyte formula, weirdly.

09:22.361 --> 09:24.931
- Mm, you know I can't do that.

09:25.031 --> 09:27.066
- I know. - But...

09:27.133 --> 09:29.435
I'm happy you're here, Dr. Carpet.

09:29.535 --> 09:32.305
Could you be a big man and do me a favor?

09:32.405 --> 09:35.041
- My pleasure, my darling.

09:35.107 --> 09:37.577
- Could you teach these interns

09:37.643 --> 09:41.981
how to sacrifice rats and extract their livers?

09:46.986 --> 09:48.955
- Uh, yeah.

09:49.055 --> 09:51.657
- Okay, so the medic said

09:51.757 --> 09:53.593
that you should take, like, two now,

09:53.659 --> 09:56.629
and then you're gonna take two in four hours.

09:56.729 --> 09:58.064
But you don't even have to worry about it

09:58.130 --> 10:00.333
because I'm gonna bring them to you.

10:00.433 --> 10:02.602
How are you feeling? - Oh, it's fine.

10:02.668 --> 10:04.337
Something fun to talk about at parties.

10:04.437 --> 10:06.639
- That's the spirit, and in the meantime,

10:06.739 --> 10:10.009
I am gonna give your sweet little hands a hand massage.

10:10.109 --> 10:11.777
- Oh, Porshe.

10:11.844 --> 10:13.579
Thank you for taking care of me.

10:13.646 --> 10:15.348
I feel so protected.

10:16.616 --> 10:18.851
- I love taking care of you, Dory.

10:18.951 --> 10:21.354
- Well, you really are the best at it.

10:24.190 --> 10:25.825
Mm.

10:27.827 --> 10:29.829
- God, that woman was a lunatic, huh?

10:29.929 --> 10:31.530
- Mm. - And I truly cannot believe

10:31.631 --> 10:32.798
that the disciples just fled

10:32.865 --> 10:34.266
as soon as you were under attack.

10:34.333 --> 10:35.434
And the whole time, I'm thinking, like,

10:35.501 --> 10:36.969
if I was just sitting there,

10:37.036 --> 10:38.471
I absolutely would've been able to prevent it.

10:38.537 --> 10:39.972
- True. - I just don't think

10:40.039 --> 10:41.941
these disciples can't handle the job,

10:42.008 --> 10:43.042
do you know what I mean?

10:43.142 --> 10:44.477
Like, God bless them.

10:44.543 --> 10:45.945
But I just think they don't know what it's like

10:46.012 --> 10:47.179
to have to work.

10:48.481 --> 10:51.817
- So you, um-- you take your rat.

10:53.319 --> 10:54.954
And then you--

10:55.021 --> 10:57.156
Have a lot of little tools here.

10:57.223 --> 11:00.893
For example, got a little box cutter we could--

11:00.993 --> 11:02.895
- You mean a scalpel?

11:02.995 --> 11:04.897
- That's one way to do it,

11:04.997 --> 11:09.068
slit its poor little throat and let it bleed out.

11:09.168 --> 11:12.304
I don't want to do this. I want it to go faster.

11:14.840 --> 11:16.208
So we could--what you could--

11:16.308 --> 11:18.744
you could take its little head,

11:18.844 --> 11:20.746
you could take its little head,

11:20.846 --> 11:24.650
and you can put it under a...

11:24.717 --> 11:29.722
binder, classically, like this one, per se.

11:29.822 --> 11:32.191
And you're going to place

11:32.258 --> 11:34.226
its sweet little head underneath.

11:34.326 --> 11:37.596
And you're gonna just press it down with as much force,

11:37.697 --> 11:39.432
as quickly as you can,

11:39.532 --> 11:42.568
until its poor little brains are crushed.

11:44.170 --> 11:45.337
Jesus Christ.

11:51.177 --> 11:54.046
- Why don't you do that

11:54.113 --> 11:57.717
while I do something else entirely?

12:00.119 --> 12:03.556
I just want all these brains crushed before I get back,

12:03.622 --> 12:05.357
and that's an order.

12:08.794 --> 12:10.763
- Okay. One, two...

12:10.863 --> 12:11.964
- Ew!

12:12.064 --> 12:13.699
- Oh, my God. - Oh, God!

12:13.766 --> 12:14.900
Sweet Christ.

12:14.967 --> 12:17.269
Good job, everyone. Good going.

12:50.836 --> 12:54.006
- Mr. Goss, I'm not interested in games here.

12:54.106 --> 12:55.808
- What are you talking about?

12:55.908 --> 12:58.110
Do you know what I had to go through to get that formula?

12:58.177 --> 12:59.612
What else do you want me to do?

12:59.678 --> 13:01.013
- The only thing that this formula

13:01.113 --> 13:03.482
will give people is diabetes.

13:03.582 --> 13:05.417
- What? What are you saying?

13:05.484 --> 13:06.786
- Jelly beans.

13:06.852 --> 13:09.755
You gave me jelly beans.

13:11.257 --> 13:13.259
No, no, this is the formula.

13:13.325 --> 13:15.194
- If you ever want that child out of your life,

13:15.294 --> 13:17.663
you're gonna have to start playing by the rules.

13:17.763 --> 13:20.032
Don't monkey me, Mr. Goss,

13:20.132 --> 13:22.768
I invented monkeys.

13:29.809 --> 13:31.777
- Hey, hey, girl. - Hey.

13:31.844 --> 13:33.546
- Hey, Dory, I need to talk to you about something.

13:33.646 --> 13:35.047
Oh, my God. Are you okay?

13:35.147 --> 13:37.316
- Oh, yeah. I was cut by this woman.

13:37.383 --> 13:39.518
- What? Like, a stranger?

13:39.618 --> 13:42.221
- Elliott, can you give Dory some space, please?

13:42.321 --> 13:43.989
- Excuse me? - I'm serious, okay?

13:44.056 --> 13:46.492
She doesn't need extra stress. You're a close talker.

13:48.160 --> 13:50.696
Well, I need to talk to Dory privately right now,

13:50.796 --> 13:52.298
so I might suggest that your encroaching

13:52.364 --> 13:54.233
on our one-on-one conversation is actually

13:54.333 --> 13:56.368
creating unnecessary tension for the group.

13:56.468 --> 13:58.571
- You have three minutes.

14:00.072 --> 14:03.008
- Okay. So what's going on? - Okay, so...

14:03.075 --> 14:05.978
I know this doctor through my son's school

14:06.045 --> 14:08.214
as part of, like, a daddy's circle or whatever.

14:08.314 --> 14:09.748
His name is Dr. Carpet.

14:09.849 --> 14:12.218
I think he's, like, very high up at Tunnel Industries.

14:12.318 --> 14:14.854
He's apparently very, like, beloved, which is sweet.

14:14.920 --> 14:16.222
- Okay.

14:16.322 --> 14:20.392
- Anyway, so he told me that this laboratory

14:20.492 --> 14:24.430
may not actually be working on a formula for enlightenment.

14:24.530 --> 14:25.831
- Hmm.

14:25.898 --> 14:29.101
Well, what does he think they're working on, then?

14:32.905 --> 14:35.441
- Jelly beans.

14:35.541 --> 14:37.009
- What do you mean?

14:37.076 --> 14:39.545
- He said that the preclinical trial formula 391-E,

14:39.612 --> 14:40.779
which is the current formula...

14:40.880 --> 14:44.250
- Mm-hmm. - Is just jelly beans.

14:45.217 --> 14:47.286
Okay, it's not common knowledge, though.

14:47.386 --> 14:51.190
He told me in, like, total confidence, wasted.

14:51.257 --> 14:54.226
He gets, like, completely trashed and tells me things.

14:54.293 --> 14:56.729
I'm actually very concerned about it.

14:56.795 --> 14:57.796
I should talk to someone about it.

14:57.897 --> 14:58.864
Real--he's real. - El?

14:58.931 --> 14:59.798
- What?

14:59.899 --> 15:01.567
- Is this for real?

15:03.135 --> 15:04.236
- Yes.

15:13.479 --> 15:15.214
- Where you going, boo-boo?

15:16.982 --> 15:20.319
- We sacrificed the rats so we can extract their livers.

15:20.419 --> 15:22.988
- But you massacred them.

15:23.088 --> 15:27.059
I don't understand. It's inhumane.

15:27.126 --> 15:28.460
- Benny?

15:28.560 --> 15:30.396
Can I talk to you for a moment?

15:31.597 --> 15:36.001
Can I ask, where are we at with the science?

15:36.101 --> 15:37.803
- The science? - Mm-hmm.

15:37.903 --> 15:39.138
- It's on track.

15:39.238 --> 15:41.273
We're trucking along in here.

15:41.340 --> 15:42.675
- Hmm.

15:42.775 --> 15:46.578
Tell me about preclinical trial formula 391-E.

15:46.645 --> 15:48.347
- How do you know about that?

15:48.447 --> 15:49.782
- Are they jelly beans?

15:51.517 --> 15:52.785
- No.

15:54.687 --> 15:56.455
- I'd like to see the formula in its current state.

15:56.522 --> 15:58.590
- I'm sorry, but it's prohibited.

15:58.657 --> 16:00.592
- If you don't show me,

16:00.659 --> 16:01.994
you're fired.

16:45.804 --> 16:47.840
- Jesper Society?

17:06.592 --> 17:09.695
Oh, no, am I gonna really go to Maine?

17:09.762 --> 17:11.663
- Okay, thank you. Thank you.

17:11.730 --> 17:13.232
Thanks. Good, good, good.

17:13.332 --> 17:15.601
And close the door behind you, please. Thank you.

17:18.704 --> 17:20.105
- So is she fired? - No.

17:20.205 --> 17:21.673
She's a genius. No, not fired.

17:21.740 --> 17:24.510
No, all this miscommunication is a, you know--

17:24.576 --> 17:27.579
I'm glad that it's water under the bridge at this point.

17:27.679 --> 17:31.517
- So they are actually working on something, right?

17:31.583 --> 17:33.052
- Oh, yeah. They sure are.

17:33.118 --> 17:34.620
Yeah. You know what I think it was?

17:34.720 --> 17:37.856
I think it was some kind of prank call or something.

17:37.923 --> 17:40.092
And I'm gonna find out who that was.

17:40.192 --> 17:41.560
They're gonna be held accountable.

17:41.627 --> 17:44.463
Nobody gets to alarm you unnecessarily like that.

17:44.563 --> 17:47.232
- I tasted them.

17:47.299 --> 17:48.867
They were sweet.

17:51.203 --> 17:53.238
It was concerning. - Well, I don't know why.

17:53.305 --> 17:54.973
There's no reason for concern for that.

17:55.074 --> 18:00.045
No, there's sugar compounds that we use in all medicines

18:00.112 --> 18:02.114
at the preclinical trial phase

18:02.214 --> 18:04.716
in order to hold together the chemicals.

18:04.783 --> 18:06.318
They're sweet. They're just sweet.

18:06.418 --> 18:11.290
- Tunnel, why are we making jelly beans?

18:11.390 --> 18:14.259
And why are you lying to me about it?

18:24.503 --> 18:26.105
- I'm gonna tell you the whole truth.

18:26.171 --> 18:29.441
The purpose of this company is to give people hope.

18:29.508 --> 18:32.578
And if we make a scientific breakthrough along the way,

18:32.644 --> 18:34.246
that's great.

18:34.313 --> 18:37.082
But I'm not eager to find out this particular endeavor

18:37.149 --> 18:39.785
is, in fact, actually...

18:39.852 --> 18:41.620
not possible.

18:41.687 --> 18:44.356
And I don't want our investors getting wind of that either.

18:44.456 --> 18:46.425
What I'd like is for the enthusiasm

18:46.492 --> 18:48.360
and the hype to keep building

18:48.460 --> 18:50.262
so that this company

18:50.329 --> 18:52.097
has a value that can keep increasing

18:52.164 --> 18:55.501
so that when I sell the company,

18:55.601 --> 19:00.472
we all stand to make a nice chunk of change.

19:01.807 --> 19:03.675
- So this is all about the money to you.

19:03.775 --> 19:09.047
- Dory, the pursuit of everybody living life well

19:09.148 --> 19:11.116
is enlightenment.

19:12.651 --> 19:15.554
- You are a crook. - Uh-uh, no.

19:15.654 --> 19:17.022
I'm a savvy businessman.

19:17.122 --> 19:18.557
And I'll tell you something else I'm not,

19:18.657 --> 19:22.494
and that's delusional, which you are.

19:22.561 --> 19:24.396
It'd be real easy for me

19:24.496 --> 19:26.632
to put you right back in that asylum.

19:26.698 --> 19:30.836
But I would rather that you and I stay on friendly footing.

19:33.572 --> 19:36.408
- I know that there's a way to make this work.

19:36.508 --> 19:38.076
- I hope so.

19:38.177 --> 19:40.045
In the meantime...

19:40.145 --> 19:43.815
enjoy jelly beans.

20:05.037 --> 20:06.605
- Whose account are we gonna film it?

20:06.705 --> 20:09.007
Like, is it gonna be a tripod? Are we gonna prop it up?

20:09.074 --> 20:11.710
- We should all-- - On all of our platforms.

20:11.777 --> 20:13.045
- And I could use my ring light.

20:13.111 --> 20:14.680
It'd be perfect. - Oh, my God.

20:14.746 --> 20:16.715
- No way. Okay. It's pretty good, but let's--

20:19.218 --> 20:22.287
- Oh, look, wait, there's Dory. - Oh, oh, Dory, Dory, hey.

20:22.387 --> 20:24.089
You want to see this dance we've been working on?

20:24.189 --> 20:25.524
- We're gonna be going live with it tonight.

20:25.591 --> 20:28.560
- Okay, ready? Five, six, seven...

20:28.627 --> 20:31.296
all:

20:35.434 --> 20:37.569
- Don't you love it, Dory? Don't you love it?

20:37.636 --> 20:39.071
Isn't it so cheeky?

20:39.137 --> 20:40.439
- Hi. - Oh.

20:40.539 --> 20:41.773
- Are you okay?

20:41.873 --> 20:43.475
Oh, my God. You look white as a ghost.

20:43.575 --> 20:45.544
- No, this isn't working.

20:45.611 --> 20:48.714
- Oh, should I go down first instead of up?

20:48.780 --> 20:50.749
- And this has to work.

20:53.585 --> 20:58.890
Do you understand what is coming if this doesn't work?

21:00.759 --> 21:02.995
We only get one shot at this.

21:05.597 --> 21:08.500
So enough of the selfies, enough of the dances,

21:08.600 --> 21:11.336
enough of the childish shit.

21:11.436 --> 21:15.274
We have to find a way!

21:15.340 --> 21:19.177
And I can't be the only one who's doing this.

21:19.278 --> 21:22.481
No one is--no one is taking this seriously.

21:23.582 --> 21:26.184
- Dory, we're here to help you. - No, don't touch me.

21:26.285 --> 21:27.686
Don't touch me. - Okay, okay.

21:27.786 --> 21:29.087
- Stay away from me.

21:29.154 --> 21:31.923
- Are you okay, babe? - Dory?

21:31.990 --> 21:34.626
- Dory, are you okay? You don't look so good.

21:36.328 --> 21:38.263
- Oh, my God, Dor, Dor, Dor, Dor,

21:38.330 --> 21:41.533
Dor, Dor, Dor, Dor, Dor, Dor, Dor!

21:56.315 --> 21:59.351
You're awake. Hi.

21:59.451 --> 22:02.454
- What happened to me?

22:02.521 --> 22:05.657
- Oh, you have a really high fever.

22:05.724 --> 22:07.826
But don't worry.

22:07.893 --> 22:09.828
I'm keeping you safe.

22:12.164 --> 22:13.832
- Where are the disciples?

22:14.666 --> 22:17.069
- The disciples are exhausting you.

22:17.169 --> 22:19.738
And frankly, I don't think that we can trust them.

22:19.838 --> 22:23.008
They are not in this

22:23.075 --> 22:25.143
for the same reasons that we are, Dor.

22:25.210 --> 22:27.579
They're just not.

22:30.182 --> 22:31.416
Oh, no.

22:31.516 --> 22:33.919
Ooh, something's really wrong with me.

22:34.019 --> 22:37.022
- You know, you're overworked. - Oh, my stomach.

22:37.089 --> 22:40.325
- Oh, okay, here, here, here.

22:40.392 --> 22:43.095
Have some of this, sweetie. - Hmm?

22:43.195 --> 22:44.363
- This will make you feel better.

22:44.429 --> 22:46.365
It's really good for tummy aches.

22:49.000 --> 22:50.102
That's good.

22:51.203 --> 22:52.571
Good girl.

23:02.581 --> 23:06.118
- I'm really scared of this ending.

23:06.218 --> 23:07.753
What am I gonna do, just go back

23:07.853 --> 23:10.422
to hoping companies send me free roller skates

23:10.522 --> 23:12.524
so that I can be loved?

23:12.591 --> 23:14.459
It's a capitalistic lie.

23:14.559 --> 23:18.597
- No, no, no, no, no. This is our life now.

23:18.697 --> 23:20.399
We know better.

23:20.465 --> 23:22.801
We are an anxious and depressed society

23:22.901 --> 23:26.972
because we've been denied spirituality for too long.

23:27.072 --> 23:29.274
And we cannot go back to that.

23:29.374 --> 23:31.309
That is not life.

23:31.410 --> 23:32.477
- Well, it's too bad.

23:32.577 --> 23:35.313
She's just gonna throw us all away.

23:35.414 --> 23:37.282
I can feel it.

23:37.382 --> 23:40.385
It's just like everyone else in my life.

23:40.452 --> 23:43.655
I'm disposable.

23:43.755 --> 23:44.990
- I have an idea.

23:45.891 --> 23:48.994
But it does involve killing myself.

23:50.061 --> 23:53.565
- She needs to see us, really see us.

23:53.632 --> 23:55.000
Right now, she can't see.

23:55.100 --> 23:58.003
We need to show her that we are here for good

23:58.103 --> 23:59.738
and that we're strong enough

23:59.805 --> 24:01.973
to be the leaders of this revolution.

24:02.073 --> 24:03.508
- You know what?

24:03.608 --> 24:07.179
I want to become my color, whatever that takes.

24:07.279 --> 24:09.514
Then she would see my dedication.

24:11.583 --> 24:13.685
Ritchie?

24:13.785 --> 24:15.954
Be a scientist.

24:19.124 --> 24:21.860
Make me be a color.

24:21.960 --> 24:26.798
- Okay. This is yellow enough.

24:28.133 --> 24:33.605
So this is going to sear into your skin and crystallize.

24:33.672 --> 24:35.307
It is gonna be the most painful thing

24:35.373 --> 24:37.108
you've ever experienced in your life.

24:37.175 --> 24:39.311
Are you sure you want to go through with this?

24:40.212 --> 24:41.847
- Mm-hmm.

24:41.947 --> 24:42.948
- Hold her down.

24:49.154 --> 24:51.356
- Oh, my God, that's awful!

24:51.456 --> 24:54.659
- Oh, I can't. I can't. It's so horrible.

24:56.795 --> 25:00.499
- I'm starting to feel like it's not going to be possible.

25:03.835 --> 25:05.470
- What do you mean?

25:07.839 --> 25:10.909
- I mean, if you think about it,

25:11.009 --> 25:13.178
it is pretty absurd.

25:15.013 --> 25:16.815
An enlightenment pill?

25:16.882 --> 25:19.518
- Dory.

25:19.584 --> 25:22.654
What happened that is making you feel that way?

25:24.723 --> 25:27.092
- I'm just losing faith.

25:30.028 --> 25:31.830
Dory...

25:31.897 --> 25:35.233
everyone gets to a point where they doubt

25:35.333 --> 25:38.737
that they can do amazing things, you know?

25:39.704 --> 25:41.940
What if everyone gave up when they had that doubt?

25:42.040 --> 25:45.243
We would not have things like...

25:45.343 --> 25:47.279
you know, toilet paper.

25:48.713 --> 25:51.016
Like, think about all the things

25:51.082 --> 25:52.450
that the world would have

25:52.551 --> 25:56.121
if the people that gave up didn't give up.

25:57.756 --> 26:00.258
- Right.

26:02.928 --> 26:04.195
- I'll be right back.

26:04.262 --> 26:05.864
I'm gonna check and see who's there.

26:14.573 --> 26:16.741
- What are you doing here? This is my home.

26:16.808 --> 26:18.076
- We have to see her.

26:18.143 --> 26:19.411
- How do you even know where I live?

26:22.247 --> 26:24.549
- Okay, okay, okay.

26:24.616 --> 26:26.885
Jesus Christ.

26:41.933 --> 26:43.668
What did you do?

26:44.436 --> 26:47.138
- We stand with you, Dory,

26:47.238 --> 26:50.275
until this pill gets made.
