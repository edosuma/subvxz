00:06.131 --> 00:08.007
<i>Desperate is the word you used, Charlie,</i>

00:08.090 --> 00:10.177
<i>and there is not
a more appropriate word this morning</i>

00:10.260 --> 00:13.180
for the hundreds of patients still in
hospitals throughout the New Orleans area.

00:13.263 --> 00:15.265
<i>The humidity is palpable this morning.</i>

00:15.349 --> 00:18.602
<i>It's almost strangling,
it's so humid outside here and so warm.</i>

00:18.685 --> 00:21.647
<i>So you can only imagine
what it's like inside the hospital rooms</i>

00:21.730 --> 00:25.359
<i>where there's been no power,
and in many cases, no food and no supplies</i>

00:25.442 --> 00:26.985
<i>since Katrina blew through.</i>

00:27.569 --> 00:30.822
<i>With the backup generators
gone, they have no ventilation.</i>

00:30.906 --> 00:32.448
<i>They're using portable oxygen,</i>

00:32.533 --> 00:35.827
<i>trying to decide which patients
they can give the oxygen to</i>

00:35.911 --> 00:37.704
<i>in order to prolong their lives.</i>

00:37.788 --> 00:39.081
<i>They're running out of food.</i>

00:39.164 --> 00:42.668
<i>One of the nurses walked outside
to get a breath of fresh air.</i>

00:42.751 --> 00:45.629
<i>She was held up at gunpoint.
So it is not safe.</i>

00:46.380 --> 00:49.758
<i>Well, there's still not enough
people on the ground to help everybody.</i>

00:49.842 --> 00:51.885
<i>Not enough rescue workers,
not enough police.</i>

00:51.969 --> 00:54.346
<i>Certainly not enough people
going door to door</i>

00:54.429 --> 00:56.473
<i>to try to find the people
that are in their homes.</i>

00:58.517 --> 00:59.935
<i>So consequently…</i>

01:00.018 --> 01:02.354
Steve,
I couldn't get in touch with Memorial.

01:02.437 --> 01:04.857
I don't know. Maybe they lost power.

01:04.940 --> 01:06.817
So the last email I got,

01:06.900 --> 01:11.905
"Fatigue, stress, anxiety, supplies
are all issues now. We can't take it."

01:11.989 --> 01:12.990
Jesus.

01:13.073 --> 01:17.494
<i>And the people inside the city
of New Orleans are asking repeatedly today</i>

01:17.578 --> 01:21.748
<i>to people in Washington,
"Are you watching? Are you listening?"</i>

01:21.832 --> 01:23.000
Please, man! Live!

01:24.168 --> 01:25.627
<i>For several days now,</i>

01:25.711 --> 01:28.589
<i>many people have gone without food,
water and shelter.</i>

01:28.672 --> 01:31.508
<i>The residents of New Orleans
are literally crying for help.</i>

01:31.592 --> 01:33.552
<i>As you know, the Bush administration</i>

01:33.635 --> 01:35.262
<i>has been coming under increased fire</i>

01:35.345 --> 01:38.390
<i>from local officials in New Orleans
and all across the nation.</i>

01:38.473 --> 01:44.021
<i>People unhappy it's taking so long to get
relief for the refugees in affected areas.</i>

01:44.563 --> 01:47.399
I think I might have found helicopters
that can evacuate the patients.

01:47.482 --> 01:50.611
They're here in Dallas.
They won't be to New Orleans for hours.

01:52.279 --> 01:54.740
- Send them.
- We gotta get corporate approval--

01:54.823 --> 01:56.575
No, I'll get the approvals.
Just send them.

01:56.658 --> 01:58.493
Memorial's not gonna know they're coming.

01:58.577 --> 02:00.204
Just try anything you can
to get them a message.

02:00.287 --> 02:02.539
They gotta hang on.
Hang on till those copters get there.

02:04.499 --> 02:05.834
<i>She didn't make it,</i>

02:05.918 --> 02:09.170
<i>and tens of thousands,
still stranded, wonder if they will.</i>

02:14.176 --> 02:18.889
<i>Wade in the water</i>

02:21.058 --> 02:25.812
<i>Wade in the water, children</i>

02:26.897 --> 02:31.693
<i>Wade in the water</i>

02:31.777 --> 02:36.990
<i>Wade in the water, children</i>

02:37.074 --> 02:41.662
<i>Wade in the water</i>

02:41.745 --> 02:47.042
<i>God is gonna trouble these waters</i>

02:47.125 --> 02:51.129
<i>Man went down to the river</i>

02:52.089 --> 02:57.010
<i>Man went down to the river, Lord</i>

02:57.094 --> 03:01.265
<i>Man went down to the river</i>

03:02.099 --> 03:05.769
<i>Went down there for to pray</i>

03:06.311 --> 03:07.312
<i>Oh</i>

03:07.396 --> 03:11.233
<i>Wade in the water</i>

03:12.484 --> 03:17.322
<i>Wade in the water, children</i>

03:17.406 --> 03:21.285
<i>Wade in the water</i>

03:21.994 --> 03:26.999
<i>God is gonna trouble these waters</i>

03:32.254 --> 03:38.260
<i>God's gonna trouble these waters</i>

03:46.894 --> 03:48.729
We're all gonna die here.

03:49.563 --> 03:52.900
- Hey, hey, hey. Take it easy.
- We're gonna die.

03:52.983 --> 03:54.860
Hey. Just calm down.

03:54.943 --> 03:56.236
We're all gonna die.

03:56.320 --> 03:59.573
No. You just get some rest, all right?

03:59.656 --> 04:01.617
No one's gonna die.

04:02.743 --> 04:04.453
Hey, Rachel. It's Dr. Pou.

04:06.955 --> 04:08.081
Come on.

04:12.377 --> 04:14.004
You're gonna be okay.

04:15.380 --> 04:18.716
You shut your eyes and rest. All right?

04:24.640 --> 04:28.769
It's so hot. Why is it so hot?

04:38.779 --> 04:39.863
Hey, Doctor.

04:40.948 --> 04:44.159
Hi. I'm just checking on you.
How you doing, Rodney?

04:44.243 --> 04:45.827
- Yeah, I'm good.
- Yeah?

04:46.537 --> 04:48.288
They start moving people again?

04:48.789 --> 04:51.750
Not yet. We don't have
any boats or helicopters right now.

04:53.043 --> 04:55.003
I get to go last, right?

04:57.548 --> 05:00.759
Well, I think we're still trying
to determine the best way to evacuate.

05:00.843 --> 05:03.512
Hey, I used to be a nurse.

05:04.137 --> 05:05.848
I used to work at this hospital.

05:07.015 --> 05:08.517
I know how these things go.

05:10.102 --> 05:11.770
I'm going to be hard to get out.

05:13.605 --> 05:19.069
I hear there's someone else like me here.
Another big guy up in LifeCare.

05:19.152 --> 05:20.946
We probably both gonna go last…

05:22.990 --> 05:24.825
as long as we don't get left behind.

05:34.751 --> 05:36.628
Yeah, that should feel better.

05:53.604 --> 05:56.815
There's nothing. There's no helicopters.

05:57.983 --> 06:00.360
We never should've stopped the evacuation.

06:02.112 --> 06:03.906
- We never should have stop--
- Okay!

06:07.075 --> 06:09.912
Jesus Christ!
We're in the middle of a city.

06:10.412 --> 06:12.748
We can't communicate with anybody?

06:13.874 --> 06:16.835
We're just supposed to stand up
on the roof with everyone else,

06:16.919 --> 06:19.421
holding up signs, begging for help?

06:20.297 --> 06:22.591
I tried. Everybody tried.

06:22.674 --> 06:24.801
Sandra, I know. I know.

06:26.970 --> 06:29.348
I know you tried. I know. I'm sorry.

06:34.186 --> 06:36.230
Some of the staff have been asking…

06:39.233 --> 06:40.734
They're worried about their pets.

06:42.319 --> 06:44.738
People are dying,
and they are worried about their pets?

06:44.821 --> 06:47.241
They're worried
about what's gonna happen to the animals

06:47.324 --> 06:49.243
if they have to leave them here.

06:52.371 --> 06:53.705
And they're thinking…

06:55.874 --> 06:57.960
maybe they should do the humane thing.

07:02.548 --> 07:03.590
Yeah.

07:05.717 --> 07:06.718
Probably.

07:08.136 --> 07:10.722
I'll speak to Dr. Cook.

07:10.806 --> 07:12.933
I think he knows how to do that.

07:13.016 --> 07:16.645
Y'all, I think that we have to consider

07:17.771 --> 07:21.358
patients that we can't evacuate.

07:21.942 --> 07:25.153
Making sure that they don't suffer either.

07:25.737 --> 07:29.575
You mean just keeping them comfortable,
right?

07:29.658 --> 07:31.952
Just make them comfortable.

07:32.995 --> 07:35.956
Because a lot of people are on edge.

07:36.999 --> 07:40.586
And I wanna make sure
that there is no confusion.

07:44.631 --> 07:45.632
No.

07:49.052 --> 07:50.846
No, there's no confusion.

08:11.575 --> 08:12.576
I'll be right back.

08:14.077 --> 08:17.164
Excuse me. My mother's burning up.

08:17.873 --> 08:19.499
There's nothing we can do.

08:20.626 --> 08:23.504
Well, can't you-- Is there any more ice?

08:26.924 --> 08:30.552
There is no ice. There is no water.

08:31.595 --> 08:32.929
There's nothing we can do.

08:45.734 --> 08:47.486
I'm right here.

08:47.569 --> 08:49.154
I'm right here, Ma.

08:49.238 --> 08:51.156
I'm not going anywhere.

08:52.741 --> 08:56.245
I'm right here, Ma.
I'm right here for you.

09:46.336 --> 09:47.337
Diane.

09:49.339 --> 09:50.632
How are y'all doing?

09:52.759 --> 09:56.889
Well,
we lost a few more patients this morning.

09:57.764 --> 10:03.896
Running low on water,
rubbing alcohol, clean linens.

10:05.147 --> 10:07.566
I mean I'm making a list.

10:08.066 --> 10:09.693
It's all lists now.

10:11.904 --> 10:14.072
But I will see what I can find for ya.

10:17.743 --> 10:18.744
Thank you.

10:20.996 --> 10:24.625
Diane, there are
a lot of conversations going around.

10:24.708 --> 10:25.876
A lot of talk.

10:27.503 --> 10:33.258
But the plan is
to leave no living patients behind.

10:35.552 --> 10:37.763
Yeah,
of course we're not gonna leave anyone.

10:42.434 --> 10:43.477
Okay.

10:48.732 --> 10:49.942
Susan.

10:51.485 --> 10:52.486
Thank you.

10:55.155 --> 10:56.156
Of course.

11:15.342 --> 11:18.136
Hey! Right over there.

11:31.859 --> 11:34.069
Boats. Hold steady.

11:34.152 --> 11:36.238
Y'all keep steady. Push back!

11:36.321 --> 11:38.991
Push back for me. Push back.

11:40.033 --> 11:43.620
There are only two boats. All right?
Give us a chance. Push back.

11:43.704 --> 11:44.705
Who are you with?

11:45.956 --> 11:48.000
Not with anybody. Just us.

11:48.083 --> 11:50.627
- Go find your mom.
- Sir, please. No, no.

11:51.962 --> 11:54.089
- Can you take patients?
- A few.

11:55.966 --> 11:57.718
I'm going to get somebody.
I'm coming out hot.

11:57.801 --> 11:59.011
I need these boats ready to go.

11:59.094 --> 12:01.138
They'll be ready. Guarantee.

12:01.847 --> 12:04.224
But when you leave, take me with ya.

12:10.856 --> 12:14.276
Push back for me.
Give him space, give him space. All right.

12:15.110 --> 12:16.111
Vera LeBlanc!

12:16.862 --> 12:19.865
- Ma?
- Hey. Hey, hey. Uh-uh.

12:19.948 --> 12:23.368
Vera! Vera LeBlanc! Vera.

12:24.161 --> 12:26.163
- Hey.
- Vera LeBlanc, where is she?

12:26.246 --> 12:27.247
Who are you?

12:27.331 --> 12:29.625
Jesus.
Can you please tell me where my mother is?

12:29.708 --> 12:32.920
- Okay, you can't be here.
- Mark? Mark! Mark!

12:33.003 --> 12:35.756
- Okay, hey! Hey, I said you can't be here!
- Mom!

12:38.592 --> 12:39.676
Mom.

12:44.139 --> 12:45.140
Mom.

12:49.520 --> 12:52.105
How come you don't even
have her hooked up to an IV?

12:53.482 --> 12:56.568
We were told to suspend--

12:56.652 --> 12:58.153
Y'all decide to quit being doctors?

13:03.116 --> 13:04.368
Come on. Grab her stuff.

13:05.494 --> 13:06.495
Okay.

13:13.961 --> 13:15.087
Come on.

13:16.463 --> 13:17.464
Get in that boat.

13:18.924 --> 13:21.343
- Sandra.
- Okay. Here, help me.

13:25.347 --> 13:26.598
Here, be careful.

13:28.016 --> 13:29.017
You got her?

13:29.101 --> 13:31.186
Good job.
Take a seat, take a seat, take a seat.

13:31.270 --> 13:33.730
- Full load?
- All we can take.

13:34.314 --> 13:35.357
Let's go.

13:38.861 --> 13:41.780
All right, back up. They're pulling out!

13:43.407 --> 13:46.201
Step back!
All right, they're gonna pull out now.

13:46.285 --> 13:49.204
The fans are gonna come on.
Watch yourself. Step back!

13:50.664 --> 13:53.834
It's gonna be okay. It's gonna be okay.

13:56.378 --> 13:57.629
I got you now.

14:01.508 --> 14:03.594
Watch yourself!

14:06.680 --> 14:11.185
Charles! Hey, Charles! Charles!

14:11.268 --> 14:14.688
What the hell are you doing? Charles!

14:16.565 --> 14:20.569
You're a coward!
You are a coward, Charles!

14:21.653 --> 14:22.821
You're a coward!

14:39.713 --> 14:43.383
<i>I know everyone's feeling
like no one is coming to help us.</i>

14:44.009 --> 14:45.677
<i>Everybody feels abandoned.</i>

14:46.887 --> 14:50.140
But the doctors--
It's like they've given up.

14:52.809 --> 14:56.188
It's like they just stopped trying,
and they're trying to…

14:58.565 --> 15:00.776
Well, I guess they're leaving
patients to themselves.

15:02.069 --> 15:04.154
Nobody's getting out of here.

15:05.656 --> 15:09.993
We're not getting out of here.
We're not getting out.

15:11.537 --> 15:13.622
<i>Come on, we can't just do nothing.</i>

15:13.705 --> 15:18.585
So start walking the line.
One end of the corridor to the other.

15:19.461 --> 15:21.755
Check patients' BPs, their blood sugars.

15:21.839 --> 15:24.174
If they need to be given medication,
get them.

15:25.050 --> 15:27.135
If they need urgent attention
or monitoring,

15:27.219 --> 15:28.846
see if you can find their medical records,

15:28.929 --> 15:31.014
and share them
with any of the nurses on duty.

15:32.641 --> 15:34.226
We were told to suspend care.

15:34.309 --> 15:36.937
So? I don't care
what those other doctors told you.

15:37.020 --> 15:38.564
They're still our patients.

15:39.356 --> 15:42.609
So we're gonna do what we can,
best we can.

16:23.108 --> 16:24.234
How's he doing?

16:25.611 --> 16:27.487
He's doing all right.

16:29.489 --> 16:30.490
Holding up.

16:36.622 --> 16:38.081
Should I kill him?

16:40.167 --> 16:43.504
Even if we can get out of here,
they're not gonna let us take pets.

16:43.587 --> 16:44.588
And I--

16:46.507 --> 16:47.841
I just can't leave him.

16:56.308 --> 16:59.019
Should I put him down?

18:07.754 --> 18:10.048
You can't smoke in the hospital.

18:13.927 --> 18:15.137
How's it going?

18:16.597 --> 18:19.183
Some of the staff have asked what…

18:21.310 --> 18:24.104
what's the most humane thing to do
with their pets.

18:25.606 --> 18:28.358
The most humane thing
is not to leave them behind to die.

18:31.945 --> 18:34.364
How is that-- How's that done?

18:35.365 --> 18:37.868
An injection of Pentothal.

18:40.329 --> 18:41.538
It's that simple.

18:42.623 --> 18:45.918
You give them the shot,
they go to sleep and die.

18:49.171 --> 18:50.380
Is that--

18:52.299 --> 18:54.885
Do you think that's the right thing to do?

18:55.802 --> 18:58.931
We have to be realistic
about the situation.

18:59.014 --> 19:01.099
We are getting to that point.

19:04.436 --> 19:08.482
Most humane thing to do is
to put them down. Give them a little help.

19:12.861 --> 19:14.279
Give them a little push.

19:23.705 --> 19:27.501
I'm telling you. I can't stand this heat.

19:49.815 --> 19:52.025
Copters. We got helicopters!

19:52.526 --> 19:53.735
<i>Got it.</i>

19:54.695 --> 19:57.656
Karen, we've got helicopters.
Start moving people.

19:57.739 --> 19:58.574
-<i>Copy.</i>
- Martin.

19:58.657 --> 20:00.742
- Yeah.
- We've got helicopters back.

20:00.826 --> 20:02.911
Karen's moving patients.
We've got to keep things orderly.

20:02.995 --> 20:03.996
Right.

20:04.538 --> 20:07.499
Hey, listen. Listen to me.

20:08.125 --> 20:11.670
As was decided,
patients with black wristbands, with DNRs,

20:11.753 --> 20:12.921
they need to be set aside.

20:13.005 --> 20:14.506
They go last, understand?

20:14.590 --> 20:15.632
Yeah.

20:19.428 --> 20:20.429
Shit.

20:25.976 --> 20:29.229
Diane, the helicopters are back.
There's a bunch of them.

20:29.313 --> 20:31.398
Start moving patients.
Start taking them to the helipad.

20:31.481 --> 20:33.942
- Did you clear this with Memor--
- I'm not clearing anything with them.

20:34.026 --> 20:36.945
We're moving our patients.
Get the most critical out first.

20:37.029 --> 20:40.616
Everybody, start moving patients!
We're taking them to the helipad.

20:41.116 --> 20:42.492
Right now? Okay.

20:42.993 --> 20:44.244
Emmett.

20:45.829 --> 20:46.830
Emmett.

20:47.748 --> 20:51.835
Hey. It's getting to be time
to move patients.

20:52.419 --> 20:54.463
I need you to hang on, okay?

20:55.130 --> 20:57.549
Yeah. Okay.

20:57.633 --> 20:58.634
Okay.

21:01.595 --> 21:02.679
All right.

21:03.514 --> 21:06.266
Now you orient the needle
as close to the heart as possible.

21:07.434 --> 21:10.854
About a-- Well,
about 10 ccs should take care of it.

21:16.527 --> 21:17.528
Will it hurt?

21:17.611 --> 21:20.155
They're animals.
They don't understand what's going on.

21:26.078 --> 21:29.289
Wh-- Jesus Christ. Never mind.

21:32.125 --> 21:33.502
<i>Bring 'em down.</i>

21:33.585 --> 21:36.713
Come on, come on. Gentle.

21:37.297 --> 21:38.423
That's it, come on.

21:38.924 --> 21:41.260
That's it, just bring her on--
Just bring-- Be gentle.

21:42.052 --> 21:43.637
That's it. Just keep going.

21:43.720 --> 21:45.264
Hold on, hold on.

21:46.431 --> 21:49.226
- No, we're not moving those patients yet.
-"Those patients"? What's that mean?

21:49.309 --> 21:51.854
Patients with black armbands. DNRs.
They're going last.

21:51.937 --> 21:53.856
- Well, she needs to go.
- Black bands, DNRs go last.

21:53.939 --> 21:55.691
I'm not arguing!

21:57.025 --> 21:58.443
I'm telling you.

22:00.779 --> 22:01.780
Come on.

22:02.281 --> 22:04.408
Okay, just bring her in. Come on. Come on.

22:07.035 --> 22:08.370
There you go.

22:14.835 --> 22:16.461
That's it.

22:16.545 --> 22:18.881
Here we go. Yeah.

22:21.967 --> 22:23.343
That's it.

22:25.846 --> 22:30.851
That's it, that's it. You got this. Yeah.

22:32.561 --> 22:35.230
Just sit up. There you go.
Yeah, you stay with me.

22:35.772 --> 22:37.941
Stay with me. That's it.

22:38.025 --> 22:39.568
There you go.

22:41.737 --> 22:44.656
There you go. That's it. That's it.

24:16.164 --> 24:17.583
Help.

24:19.084 --> 24:20.252
I need some help.

24:25.799 --> 24:26.800
What's happening?

24:27.342 --> 24:29.303
Labored breathing, but I just-- I can't…

24:29.386 --> 24:30.888
Okay, I got it.

24:34.725 --> 24:36.685
It's okay. Where are you coming from?

24:37.186 --> 24:41.023
LifeCare.
They won't let us transport our patients.

24:42.566 --> 24:44.193
People are up there dying.

24:45.652 --> 24:46.737
Nobody cares.

24:51.366 --> 24:52.492
I'll stay with her.

24:53.952 --> 24:56.371
It's okay. I can stay with her.

25:35.369 --> 25:36.662
She's passed.

25:37.579 --> 25:39.373
Can you…

25:41.708 --> 25:43.502
I'll have someone take care of her.

26:02.437 --> 26:07.150
Susan, have you heard from anybody?
The police, the National Guard?

26:07.234 --> 26:09.236
Is there any plan
to get the patients out of here?

26:09.319 --> 26:11.697
A plan? No.

26:12.990 --> 26:14.032
No.

26:15.033 --> 26:19.371
People keep telling us things,
but I've stopped believing.

26:28.839 --> 26:32.885
I just watched a patient die.
Another patient die.

26:33.969 --> 26:35.762
- One of ours?
- LifeCare.

26:35.846 --> 26:37.055
Oh, God.

26:38.056 --> 26:40.434
- They have got no help up there.
- No.

26:41.518 --> 26:42.811
- Nothing.
- No.

26:47.608 --> 26:48.650
You know…

26:50.194 --> 26:52.446
I look at some of these patients…

26:55.073 --> 26:57.242
and what they're going through,

26:57.326 --> 27:01.330
what we're putting them through.

27:06.627 --> 27:09.213
You know,
they're like my cancer patients.

27:13.550 --> 27:18.430
You do everything you can
to try and help them.

27:18.514 --> 27:21.016
No matter the odds, no matter--

27:22.935 --> 27:26.063
no matter everything against you,
you find a way.

27:27.564 --> 27:29.816
You find a way to save a life.

27:31.902 --> 27:33.111
But sometimes…

27:35.155 --> 27:38.200
there is nothing else to do for them.

27:41.912 --> 27:43.997
Except to make them comfortable.

27:49.837 --> 27:51.088
I agree.

27:55.092 --> 27:57.636
You should talk to Dr. Cook about that.

28:38.719 --> 28:41.263
Brother-man. How you doing?

28:42.222 --> 28:43.390
Am I gonna make it out?

28:44.349 --> 28:45.851
Everybody's gonna make it out.

28:47.352 --> 28:49.062
I just know 'cause of my size…

28:50.063 --> 28:53.609
Hey. We're gonna get you out
like everybody else.

28:54.860 --> 28:55.861
Okay?

28:55.944 --> 28:57.112
- Okay.
- All right.

29:04.995 --> 29:07.497
- Right over there.
- Look at that.

29:12.044 --> 29:14.379
<i>You've all been given a mandate
from the city of New Orleans.</i>

29:14.463 --> 29:16.590
Your hospital's
been put under evacuation orders.

29:16.673 --> 29:18.675
We'll have rescue boats here soon.

29:18.759 --> 29:20.052
You need to clear everybody out.

29:20.135 --> 29:23.013
We have been trying
to evacuate the hospital.

29:23.096 --> 29:26.683
We have been trying to evacuate
for the last two days.

29:26.767 --> 29:28.435
I don't know
what you've been doing before,

29:28.519 --> 29:32.773
but I am telling you, everybody needs to
be out and the building empty by 5:00 p.m.

29:32.856 --> 29:34.691
- 5:00 p.m.?
- It's almost noon.

29:34.775 --> 29:37.569
How are we supposed to get everybody out
in five hours?

29:37.653 --> 29:40.697
With our head count,
it'll take at least 24 hours.

29:40.781 --> 29:41.865
- There are boats coming.
- Whose?

29:41.949 --> 29:43.909
More than enough.
We're gonna be running them all day.

29:43.992 --> 29:46.870
And why five o' clock? I mean, if you have
the boats, we have people who can't move.

29:46.954 --> 29:48.872
- The city is out of control.
- They can't walk.

29:48.956 --> 29:50.374
- Rioting, looting.
- We have been begging…

29:50.457 --> 29:52.000
We can't leave men
to protect the building.

29:52.084 --> 29:53.585
You've done nothing but make things worse.

29:54.086 --> 29:56.380
5:00 p.m. the last boat leaves.

29:57.548 --> 30:00.968
Everybody has to be out of the building,
if we have to drag them out.

30:07.224 --> 30:08.892
So what are we supposed to do?

30:14.648 --> 30:17.651
We'll continue
the evacuation as best we can.

30:17.734 --> 30:20.487
We can't possibly get everybody out
in five hours.

30:23.240 --> 30:26.118
No living patient will be left behind.

30:34.793 --> 30:38.505
We have been ordered to evacuate
the hospital by five o'clock.

30:41.884 --> 30:43.093
It's never gonna happen.

30:43.760 --> 30:48.056
If you haven't spoken with Dr. Cook yet,
now's the time.

30:54.521 --> 30:57.441
Eve, take over for me.

30:57.524 --> 30:58.901
I'll be right back.

31:14.416 --> 31:17.002
<i>I wasn't trying to listen in
on what they were saying,</i>

31:17.085 --> 31:18.587
but it's not like
they were being real quiet.

31:18.670 --> 31:19.713
What were they saying?

31:21.381 --> 31:22.508
I'm not exactly sure.

31:23.509 --> 31:25.135
Well,
what do you think they were saying?

31:25.802 --> 31:29.181
Okay, this is between me, you,
and the fence post, okay?

31:30.682 --> 31:34.353
They were talking about how
we're not gonna get everybody out of here,

31:34.436 --> 31:39.441
and how patients are suffering, and we
have to find a way to end the suffering.

31:41.151 --> 31:44.363
If there are patients who are in pain,
we got to do everything we can to help.

31:44.446 --> 31:46.615
That's not what they were talking about.

31:46.698 --> 31:49.159
Just comfort, you know?

31:49.660 --> 31:51.745
- I really don't think they were.
- Who is "they"?

31:52.371 --> 31:56.875
<i>Ewing Cook and Anna Pou. They were
talking about ending patient suffering.</i>

32:10.097 --> 32:12.140
We've got boats. Watch out, watch out now.

32:12.224 --> 32:13.225
Move!

32:14.393 --> 32:17.312
Start getting them ready. All right.

32:22.317 --> 32:23.443
Back up from here.

32:31.243 --> 32:33.245
All right. Right there, right there.
Pull it up.

32:37.916 --> 32:39.668
- There.
- Thank you.

32:44.590 --> 32:45.966
There.

32:46.049 --> 32:48.677
Sandra's gonna get you to the family,
all right?

32:48.760 --> 32:49.845
No.

32:49.928 --> 32:51.555
Yep. She is.

32:52.055 --> 32:55.225
And you just tell 'em I'm right
behind you. Okay? I'm right behind you.

32:55.893 --> 32:57.603
Yes. Come on.

32:59.021 --> 33:00.522
I'll be right behind you.

33:30.844 --> 33:32.054
Boats are here.

33:34.306 --> 33:36.892
Minnie. Minnie, we gotta go.

33:52.783 --> 33:56.787
Take it easy.
Watch your step. All right. Come on.

33:56.870 --> 33:59.373
- Hey, you okay?
- I got you.

33:59.456 --> 34:00.874
I'm gonna help you out.

34:05.420 --> 34:06.713
Easy, easy.

34:41.248 --> 34:43.458
Hey, hey.
You can't bring that pet on.

34:43.542 --> 34:45.793
It's okay. They can take him. We got room.

34:47.337 --> 34:48.463
Watch your step.

35:00.017 --> 35:01.018
Excuse me.

35:01.101 --> 35:02.644
Yes. Thank you.

35:02.728 --> 35:04.188
- Horace.
- Yeah.

35:04.271 --> 35:07.024
We need to seriously lower our head count,

35:07.107 --> 35:11.111
and I think that you should evacuate
with the next group.

35:11.945 --> 35:13.030
Evacuate?

35:14.198 --> 35:16.867
Susan, I can't evacuate. I'm a doctor.

35:16.950 --> 35:18.493
Doctors look after patients.

35:18.577 --> 35:20.078
- Come on. I'm a doctor.
- Horace, Horace,

35:20.162 --> 35:22.831
there is nothing else any of us can do.

35:24.458 --> 35:28.504
And there's nothing more
that I would ask you to do.

35:28.587 --> 35:30.172
It's time to go.

35:47.648 --> 35:51.944
Get downstairs, now!
Let's go! Everybody, downstairs!

35:55.948 --> 35:57.157
Dr. King.

35:59.409 --> 36:01.495
Would you like to join us in a prayer?

36:02.704 --> 36:04.414
I have people I have to take care of.

36:11.171 --> 36:14.883
...hallowed be Thy name.

36:16.218 --> 36:20.889
Thy kingdom come. Thy will be done
on Earth, as it is in Heaven.

36:22.057 --> 36:24.476
Downstairs, everybody.
Let's go. Right now!

36:24.560 --> 36:27.437
Downstairs. Everybody.

36:35.612 --> 36:36.613
Dr. Baltz?

36:53.589 --> 36:56.258
Everybody, let's go. Downstairs.

36:56.341 --> 36:58.427
I will move you forcefully. Please.

36:58.510 --> 36:59.803
Let's go. Downstairs.

36:59.887 --> 37:01.763
You, get downstairs. Right now.

37:02.764 --> 37:06.435
Everybody. Off the floor. Let's go.

37:07.352 --> 37:11.398
Downstairs, right now.
Everybody that can move, move.

37:13.317 --> 37:16.153
Everybody. Downstairs. Let's go.

37:16.236 --> 37:18.030
Go downstairs. Down the stairway.

37:18.113 --> 37:19.656
Get downstairs right now.

37:27.414 --> 37:30.751
Let's go. Everybody, on the move.
Downstairs. Let's--

37:32.127 --> 37:33.670
Come on. Everybody out.

37:33.754 --> 37:35.839
- Hospital's being evacuated.
- No. This is my mother.

37:35.923 --> 37:37.299
I'm not leaving my mother.

37:37.382 --> 37:39.468
- We are evacuating the hospital.
- They're not gonna help her.

37:39.551 --> 37:40.677
Nobody's gonna help her.

37:40.761 --> 37:42.179
You can either leave on your own,

37:42.262 --> 37:44.723
- or you'll be charged with trespassing!
- She is my mother!

37:44.806 --> 37:46.016
I'm not leaving her.

37:46.099 --> 37:48.393
I don't care what happens to me. Just--

37:48.477 --> 37:50.687
Please let me stay with my mother.

37:52.064 --> 37:53.065
Please.

37:55.776 --> 37:57.152
Get her out of here.

37:57.694 --> 37:59.905
- No. Wait, wait, wait.
- Let's go.

37:59.988 --> 38:01.323
- Let me say goodbye to her!
- Move!

38:01.406 --> 38:05.369
Let me say goodbye, please!
Please! Please!

38:10.040 --> 38:11.208
Say goodbye.

38:42.865 --> 38:44.199
Mom.

38:44.283 --> 38:46.493
Mom, hey, hey, hey.

38:50.914 --> 38:52.082
The police are here.

38:54.501 --> 39:00.090
They're making me leave the hospital,
so, I can't stay with you.

39:02.176 --> 39:03.260
It's okay.

39:05.929 --> 39:07.306
It's okay.

39:07.848 --> 39:12.811
It's okay for you to go and be with Jesus.

39:15.314 --> 39:16.857
You're going home.

40:14.957 --> 40:16.083
How's it going?

40:16.166 --> 40:18.669
These aren't Coast Guard copters.
They can't fly at night.

40:19.253 --> 40:21.338
As soon as it gets dark,
we have to cut it off.

40:21.839 --> 40:23.173
Anybody who's getting out of here…

40:25.759 --> 40:26.802
they've got an hour.

40:35.853 --> 40:37.646
We all have done…

40:41.024 --> 40:42.860
all that anyone could do…

40:42.943 --> 40:45.821
- Diane?
-…and you should be proud of that.

40:47.030 --> 40:48.907
A decision has been made.

40:48.991 --> 40:51.451
- It's the best decision--
- What's going on?

40:53.996 --> 40:55.038
Fuck.

40:55.122 --> 40:56.623
It's the only decision.

40:57.207 --> 40:58.375
Therese?

40:58.959 --> 41:00.085
Therese.

41:01.253 --> 41:03.213
- They can't do this.
- Do what?

41:03.964 --> 41:05.549
They're our patients.

41:14.391 --> 41:15.767
Diane?

41:17.311 --> 41:18.395
What's going on?

41:19.605 --> 41:21.315
The doctors from Memorial…

41:23.400 --> 41:25.652
they're gonna take over care
of our patients.

41:27.529 --> 41:29.031
What's that mean?

41:31.033 --> 41:33.911
I don't think our patients
are gonna be evacuated.

41:35.704 --> 41:37.122
They aren't gonna leave.

41:40.042 --> 41:42.252
Why is no one coming to help us?

41:43.712 --> 41:45.589
Why is nobody doing anything?

41:48.300 --> 41:51.595
I know-- I mean, this is bullshit. We've
been with these patients for five days.

41:51.678 --> 41:52.930
We're supposed to just leave them?

41:53.013 --> 41:55.974
We just supposed to just leave them?

41:57.184 --> 41:59.394
What's gonna happen, we--

42:01.230 --> 42:02.689
we can't stop from happening.

42:17.663 --> 42:19.122
Get the staff.

42:19.206 --> 42:21.792
Get them off the floor. Okay?

42:22.376 --> 42:25.712
You have to take care of them. Okay?

42:31.927 --> 42:32.928
Okay.

43:06.837 --> 43:07.838
Emmett?

43:14.052 --> 43:16.680
The staff is being told
to evacuate the hospital.

43:17.806 --> 43:19.516
And they're making us leave.

43:20.017 --> 43:21.935
And they're making us leave right now.

43:24.396 --> 43:26.815
But you said you wasn't gonna leave me.

43:29.735 --> 43:32.362
There are gonna be doctors here
from Memorial.

43:33.071 --> 43:35.824
They're gonna take care of you,
stay with you.

43:37.159 --> 43:39.661
But they're still gonna
get me out of here, right?

43:47.920 --> 43:49.338
They're gonna stay with you.

43:50.506 --> 43:52.466
Nobody's gonna leave you alone.

43:59.097 --> 44:00.349
If it--

44:01.683 --> 44:06.230
If it comes to it,
my wife's name is Carrie.

44:08.148 --> 44:10.108
- I know.
- And--

44:11.485 --> 44:12.486
Tell--

44:17.366 --> 44:18.450
Just--

44:20.160 --> 44:21.328
Just tell her whatever.

44:36.426 --> 44:38.262
God has truly blessed you.

44:43.433 --> 44:47.688
Just look to the future.

44:48.272 --> 44:50.190
Just move on forward.

44:57.656 --> 44:58.657
I'm sorry.

44:59.366 --> 45:00.868
I know.

46:11.021 --> 46:13.440
Anna. Can you lend a hand?

46:15.317 --> 46:16.944
I have to go back up to seven.

46:17.027 --> 46:19.738
Are you going up to LifeCare?
Are patients still up there?

46:19.821 --> 46:21.073
A few, yeah.

46:21.156 --> 46:25.410
We're gonna do everything we can
to make them comfortable. Yeah.

46:35.671 --> 46:38.632
Okay, everybody. Everybody?

46:39.466 --> 46:40.843
Everybody, listen up.

46:41.677 --> 46:46.265
We are getting all of these patients
out of here. Every one of them.

46:47.224 --> 46:48.642
We are nurses.

46:51.270 --> 46:53.438
And we are gonna get it done. I need help.

46:55.691 --> 46:59.111
Okay. Hey, Rodney. You ready to go?

46:59.945 --> 47:01.738
- Yeah.
- We're getting you out of here.

47:01.822 --> 47:04.533
Okay. We're getting Rodney out of here,
understand?

47:06.368 --> 47:09.162
Off the floor! Let's go!

47:11.957 --> 47:13.000
I have to go back.

47:13.542 --> 47:16.670
- Let's go!
- I can't-- I have to. I have to.

47:16.753 --> 47:18.172
I have to go back.

47:18.672 --> 47:19.798
- Diane.
- Go back…

47:19.882 --> 47:20.966
Diane.

47:24.720 --> 47:26.889
I need to go back upstairs.
I need to check on a patient.

47:26.972 --> 47:30.225
- We're keeping track of the patients.
- No, no. I work at LifeCare.

47:30.309 --> 47:32.561
Anything you need to know,
you can email our corporate office.

47:32.644 --> 47:34.188
- We'll let you know--
- Why your offices?

47:34.271 --> 47:36.315
- We're a different hospital.
- We're evacuating.

47:36.398 --> 47:39.693
You need to go. Now.

47:42.571 --> 47:44.698
Let's go, everybody!

47:44.781 --> 47:47.576
Don't carry that.
Just leave it behind. Let's go.

47:47.659 --> 47:48.660
Let's go!

47:49.661 --> 47:50.662

47:53.999 --> 47:55.000
Diane.

47:55.751 --> 47:57.878
Everybody, get off the floor!

47:59.880 --> 48:01.048
