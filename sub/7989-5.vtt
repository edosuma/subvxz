WEBVTT

00:01.414 --> 00:03.312
<i>Previously on
Shades Of Blue...</i>

00:03.392 --> 00:04.614
I trusted your assurance

00:04.711 --> 00:06.936
that no one else
will push into that territory.

00:07.033 --> 00:08.799
We both want what's best
for the community.

00:08.800 --> 00:09.941
Portuguese, right?

00:09.977 --> 00:11.615
When I realized the escort
was Brazilian,

00:11.650 --> 00:12.785
<i>I asked her to teach me
how to say a few things.</i>

00:12.821 --> 00:14.358
You've never been married.

00:14.393 --> 00:16.398
<i>You don't know how bad
it could get.</i>

00:16.434 --> 00:17.670
Wozniak doesn't
know anything.

00:17.705 --> 00:19.845
Only that we accessed
his inner circle.

00:19.880 --> 00:22.186
There's a rat
on my team!

00:22.222 --> 00:24.528
You're about to move
a lot of illegal cash.

00:24.564 --> 00:25.767
You need to get this
buttoned up.

00:27.140 --> 00:28.410
I need to know
if you're still in.

00:28.445 --> 00:29.514
Yeah, you do.

00:31.000 --> 00:37.074

00:52.199 --> 00:54.305
Unh! Get off me, bitch!

00:54.341 --> 00:56.179
I only had you
on failure to appear.

00:56.214 --> 00:57.919
Now I have you on resisting.

00:59.259 --> 01:00.595
And a concealed weapon.

01:00.631 --> 01:02.068
You look that good
in orange?

01:02.103 --> 01:05.848
Whole park, and you had to
tackle me into some dog crap?

01:05.883 --> 01:08.424
Oh, no.
What?

01:08.460 --> 01:10.934
No!

01:10.969 --> 01:15.249
- What happened to you?
- What does it smell like?

01:15.284 --> 01:16.621
I hate warrant day.

01:16.656 --> 01:18.595
Yeah, well, I had to tackle
my guy into a rose bush.

01:18.631 --> 01:20.836
Seriously?
A bed of roses?

01:20.873 --> 01:22.409
It wasn't a total loss.

01:22.445 --> 01:24.718
We just confiscated about
$1/2 million in heroin.

01:29.972 --> 01:33.416
That means somebody
dangerous lost it.

01:33.452 --> 01:35.256
They're gonna
be out for blood.

01:40.478 --> 01:42.918
- Matt!
- Sorry.

01:42.954 --> 01:44.190
I put a chair up
in the kitchen.

01:44.226 --> 01:46.933
- You brought home a dog?
- Eh, yeah.

01:46.969 --> 01:49.141
He was in an alley,
and he looked skinny,

01:49.177 --> 01:50.780
so I just figured--

01:50.816 --> 01:52.722
He could have
rabies or fleas.

01:52.757 --> 01:55.331
Baby, can you please take him
to the vet and check it out?

01:55.367 --> 01:57.205
Absolutely not.

01:57.240 --> 01:59.212
Come on,
you've taken in worse.

02:01.187 --> 02:02.424
Please.

02:08.281 --> 02:12.060
- Library's six blocks that way.
- Yo, relax, pops.

02:12.095 --> 02:13.966
I'm serving a warrant.

02:14.002 --> 02:16.275
Any minute my guy's gonna
walk out that building.

02:20.459 --> 02:22.999
That's the third time
I seen that car today.

02:23.035 --> 02:25.910
Congratulations. You gonna
buy that funny book or not?

02:25.946 --> 02:28.688
He look like
he mad dogging me?

02:30.764 --> 02:32.736
Hey, homie, you want to talk?

02:32.772 --> 02:34.978
You following me?
Hmm?

02:48.329 --> 02:50.569
It's your boyfriend
with the earrings.

02:50.604 --> 02:52.375
Dude.
We said two hours.

02:52.411 --> 02:53.646
That's before
we caught a tail.

02:53.682 --> 02:55.353
We got to talk to Woz.
Wrap it up.

02:55.388 --> 02:57.293
A tail? Why would
someone be following you?

02:57.329 --> 02:59.100
Well, the guy didn't
stop to explain it to me,

02:59.135 --> 03:00.739
but I made him at
three different spots.

03:00.774 --> 03:02.679
You mean we made him.

03:02.716 --> 03:04.186
Yeah, I got you.
Far as Wozniak knows,

03:04.221 --> 03:05.925
we together all morning.

03:05.960 --> 03:08.535
Can we finish "Portuguese
for Dummies" tomorrow?

03:08.570 --> 03:12.784
I can squeeze you in
after my 9:30 orgy.

03:12.819 --> 03:15.226
Kidding.

03:15.261 --> 03:17.937
My orgy isn't until 11:00.

03:25.198 --> 03:26.635
You sure they were
following you?

03:26.670 --> 03:28.542
The guy was dogging us
all morning.

03:28.577 --> 03:30.918
It didn't occur to you to
approach calmly and request ID?

03:30.953 --> 03:32.490
It occurred to me
to beat his ass.

03:32.525 --> 03:35.635
Run the plates.
Go pay him a visit.

03:35.671 --> 03:39.549
No. You didn't get
his plates?

03:39.585 --> 03:40.988
What about you,
boy wonder?

03:41.024 --> 03:43.397
I was chasing a warrant.
He got away.

03:43.433 --> 03:46.274
Excuses are the tools
of the incompetent.

03:46.309 --> 03:47.713
So what do we do?

03:47.748 --> 03:49.586
Dog crap boy is yours.

03:52.065 --> 03:53.167
What about you?

03:53.202 --> 03:54.504
Has anyone been
following you?

03:54.541 --> 03:56.512
No.

03:56.548 --> 03:58.051
What are you thinking, feds?

03:58.087 --> 03:59.189
I think we need
to tighten things up.

03:59.224 --> 04:00.494
I don't want you
accepting even

04:00.529 --> 04:02.133
a cup of coffee
from anyone.

04:02.168 --> 04:04.040
So the dope belongs
to Raul Mendez.

04:04.075 --> 04:06.281
Driver dropped his name,
thought we'd release him.

04:06.317 --> 04:07.888
We don't work for Raul.
We tolerate him

04:07.923 --> 04:10.263
because he promised
to keep small time.

04:10.298 --> 04:12.003
Shouldn't be stocking
in those quantities.

04:12.038 --> 04:13.675
And a seizure that size

04:13.711 --> 04:15.482
could be Raul's
whole ball game.

04:15.518 --> 04:17.021
He's not gonna
let that go quietly.

04:17.055 --> 04:18.827
Maybe throw a brick
or two back to him,

04:18.863 --> 04:20.065
show of good faith?

04:20.101 --> 04:21.639
That's not
what we do, Tess.

04:21.673 --> 04:23.546
But he's a gang banger
with a long reach.

04:23.581 --> 04:26.322
Is some moral code really worth
a lot of people getting hurt?

04:26.357 --> 04:28.297
Greater good.

04:28.332 --> 04:29.634
Not a bad idea.

04:29.670 --> 04:31.241
Why don't you feel him out?

04:31.276 --> 04:32.645
He's really
gonna love hearing that he lost

04:32.682 --> 04:35.088
90% of his stash from a woman.

04:35.123 --> 04:37.296
You know it's got to
be you, Woz.

04:37.332 --> 04:39.371
All right,
I'll peel off a brick.

04:39.406 --> 04:41.043
You set up the meet.

04:44.559 --> 04:46.597
You just said we
don't work for Raul.

04:46.633 --> 04:48.973
And she just pushed back.

04:49.009 --> 04:50.479
I told you, I'm gonna start
looking at everyone.

04:50.514 --> 04:52.084
I'm gonna start with her.

04:52.120 --> 04:53.791
You think Tess
is the mole?

04:53.826 --> 04:56.601
I think that's sounding
a lot like entrapment.

04:56.636 --> 04:58.241
Harlee, please, you stink.

04:58.276 --> 04:59.813
Go home, take a shower,
all right?

04:59.848 --> 05:01.787
Meet me back at the ranch.

05:10.253 --> 05:11.958
I know how to use a phone.

05:11.993 --> 05:13.497
If I have something,
I'll call you.

05:13.532 --> 05:15.202
Harlee, I don't only call
to harass you.

05:15.238 --> 05:17.980
No, sometimes you call
to threaten me.

05:18.015 --> 05:19.853
<i>Well, today
I'm breaking new ground.</i>

05:19.889 --> 05:22.563
- I'm calling to apologize.
- Okay.

05:22.598 --> 05:26.243
<i>The things I said yesterday,
you know, I was out of line.</i>

05:26.279 --> 05:30.057
You were trying to help me and I
took out my frustrations on you.

05:30.093 --> 05:33.036
Still waiting
for those magic words.

05:33.071 --> 05:34.741
I'm sorry,

05:34.777 --> 05:37.652
<i>and thank you
for making this easy.</i>

05:37.688 --> 05:39.326
Well, now that we're
friends again,

05:39.361 --> 05:40.563
can you back off your guys?

05:40.599 --> 05:42.370
Which guys would those be?

05:42.405 --> 05:44.377
<i>The tail that you put
on Sap and Tufo.</i>

05:44.412 --> 05:47.656
They got made, and now Wozniak's
more paranoid than ever.

05:47.691 --> 05:48.927
That's not me.

05:48.963 --> 05:50.500
Well, it's not
your chirpy partner,

05:50.536 --> 05:52.507
because Tufo said that
the driver was a guy.

05:52.543 --> 05:54.247
- When was this?
- Earlier today.

05:54.283 --> 05:55.686
We're not surveiling
anyone today.

05:55.721 --> 05:57.358
I'll look into it.

05:57.394 --> 05:59.333
Shouldn't you already know
what's going on?

05:59.368 --> 06:01.340
This could be a good thing,
Harlee.

06:01.375 --> 06:04.418
If Wozniak's rattled,
then he'll make mistakes.

06:04.453 --> 06:06.325
<i>You're wasting time.</i>

06:06.361 --> 06:08.232
Get back to the precinct so
that you don't miss anything.

06:16.531 --> 06:18.604
Get back to the precinct?

06:42.086 --> 06:43.926
Macchiato with
almond milk.

06:43.961 --> 06:46.201
Almond milk?

06:46.236 --> 06:48.643
The you from ten years ago
would hate the you now.

06:48.679 --> 06:52.524
Me ten years ago didn't spend
80% of the day on her ass.

06:52.559 --> 06:54.532
Are we all done
with the foreplay?

06:56.441 --> 06:58.747
I have serious concerns
about Agent Stahl.

06:58.782 --> 07:01.257
What sort of concerns?

07:01.292 --> 07:04.702
I-I have the strong sense
his interest in me

07:04.738 --> 07:06.911
goes beyond professional.

07:06.946 --> 07:08.416
Your timing is interesting.

07:08.451 --> 07:10.256
The minute the case
gets momentum--

07:10.292 --> 07:12.398
No, I'm serious, Gail.

07:12.433 --> 07:14.471
I think that he's surveiling
me inappropriately.

07:14.508 --> 07:16.078
How do you think
this plays out?

07:16.113 --> 07:20.160
You whisper a personnel
concern and walk away?

07:20.195 --> 07:22.703
You were arrested
on federal charges.

07:22.738 --> 07:24.810
I still have rights.

07:24.845 --> 07:26.751
Expectation of privacy,
safety.

07:26.786 --> 07:30.833
I can change the player,
but the song remains the same.

07:30.868 --> 07:35.817
Now, do you have a legitimate
complaint against Agent Stahl?

07:35.853 --> 07:38.527
- Would it matter if I did?
- Yes or no, Harlee.

07:41.206 --> 07:42.777
No.

07:42.812 --> 07:44.282
I'm gonna do you
a huge favor

07:44.317 --> 07:45.954
I'm not gonna tell Stahl
about any of this

07:45.991 --> 07:48.565
because I need things to
be running smoothly right now.

07:48.600 --> 07:51.040
Don't call me again.

08:00.309 --> 08:01.579
Nah, it's empty.

08:01.615 --> 08:03.620
I thought you were
peeling off a brick.

08:03.655 --> 08:05.460
Changed my mind.

08:09.343 --> 08:12.218
Lieutenant.
You're looking well.

08:12.253 --> 08:14.460
Nice suit.
Court or church?

08:14.496 --> 08:17.840
Funeral. You caught me
during business hours.

08:17.875 --> 08:20.148
I understand you stumbled onto
something that belongs to me.

08:20.183 --> 08:21.921
Well, that's what
happens when you hire

08:21.957 --> 08:24.798
two outstanding warrants to haul
your stash in broad daylight.

08:24.833 --> 08:27.274
Well, lucky it fell
into friendly custody.

08:27.309 --> 08:30.118
You know better than
to resupply in bulk.

08:30.154 --> 08:33.429
Demand has changed.
The house can change the rules.

08:33.466 --> 08:36.909
Unfortunately, the house
is the state of New York.

08:36.945 --> 08:39.018
Your junk's been
bagged and tagged.

08:39.053 --> 08:41.226
What's it gonna take
to get it back?

08:41.260 --> 08:44.169
The legalization of heroin.
Consider it breakage,

08:44.206 --> 08:46.612
one of the downfalls
of running your own business.

08:46.647 --> 08:50.159
Breakage doesn't cover the
1/2 million I owe my connect.

08:50.194 --> 08:52.334
Give me half back
and I'll cover the loss.

08:52.369 --> 08:54.943
You're confusing this
with a negotiation-- it's not.

08:54.979 --> 08:58.557
- Then why are you here?
- To avoid confusion.

08:58.592 --> 09:01.868
I look forward to
providing you clarity.

09:01.904 --> 09:03.207
I thought we were fixing this.

09:03.242 --> 09:04.846
You just poured fuel
on the fire.

09:04.882 --> 09:07.523
I'm a cop.
He's a drug dealer.

09:20.172 --> 09:21.910
And God said,
"Let there be light."

09:21.945 --> 09:23.783
Get over here and
give me some love.

09:23.819 --> 09:25.289
Oh, you look good, Caddie.

09:25.324 --> 09:27.162
20 days locked up
is 20 days sober.

09:27.198 --> 09:28.533
How's it feel?

09:28.570 --> 09:30.073
Like I need to get high.
You holding?

09:30.109 --> 09:31.846
I'm just kidding.
Unless you are.

09:31.882 --> 09:33.284
Ugh. You know I can
leave you in there.

09:33.320 --> 09:35.995
Oh, streets have
made you cold, girl.

09:36.030 --> 09:38.002
Hey, not that
I'm not grateful,

09:38.037 --> 09:40.210
but why'd you spring me
a week early?

09:40.246 --> 09:43.824
You know how you're always
saying you owe me from way back?

09:43.859 --> 09:45.831
I need to collect.

09:45.866 --> 09:47.771
Every day I'm alive
I owe to you.

09:47.808 --> 09:49.979
Anything you need,
you got it.

09:50.015 --> 09:52.790
Think you can keep clean
for a couple more hours?

10:06.008 --> 10:07.009
Where do you want it?

10:07.044 --> 10:10.623
Camera in the bedroom,
I guess.

10:10.658 --> 10:14.471
You believe I used to
train you to bust B&Es?

10:14.506 --> 10:16.310
Now look at us.

10:16.346 --> 10:18.117
How many crimes
are we committing?

10:18.152 --> 10:20.325
More than
20 days' worth.

10:20.360 --> 10:22.734
- How long do you need?
- Two, three hours, maybe.

10:22.770 --> 10:25.143
I'll try and make sure he
doesn't come home for lunch.

10:25.178 --> 10:27.050
You gonna tell me
about this mope?

10:28.658 --> 10:31.433
The gift of plausible
deniability, Caddie. Take it.

10:31.468 --> 10:34.410
And I didn't
get you anything.

10:34.446 --> 10:36.150
You know, I know you haven't
had an apartment in a long time,

10:36.186 --> 10:38.008
but this isn't the bedroom.

10:38.009 --> 10:39.784
Yeah, I'm looking
for hidden cameras.

10:40.000 --> 10:42.540
This light goes red,
we're dead.

10:42.576 --> 10:45.017
Ours is gonna
be invisible, right?

10:45.052 --> 10:46.187
Guy doesn't know to look,

10:46.223 --> 10:48.597
I could put a camera
up his nostril.

10:48.632 --> 10:50.001
And what if he has
one of those scanners?

10:50.038 --> 10:52.879
Can't be traced to you.

10:52.914 --> 10:55.790
Why do you need
this guy, anyway?

10:55.825 --> 10:59.470
He took something from me.

10:59.505 --> 11:01.678
I'm just trying to
get it back.

11:04.457 --> 11:06.463
Real subtle, Raul.

11:06.498 --> 11:10.110
"Breakage." Wonder if he had
to look the word up first.

11:10.145 --> 11:13.254
"Breakage." Is that when
the rubber tears?

11:13.289 --> 11:14.291
Do you have to work
at being juvenile

11:14.327 --> 11:15.830
or is it just, like,
in your DNA?

11:15.866 --> 11:17.336
Are you
requesting a sample?

11:17.371 --> 11:19.076
"Breakage,"
it's a business term.

11:19.111 --> 11:21.384
Means setting money aside
for anticipated losses.

11:21.419 --> 11:22.923
I got a feeling
by end of day,

11:22.958 --> 11:25.232
Raul will be expanding
that definition.

11:27.743 --> 11:28.979
Hey, uh, we cool?

11:29.015 --> 11:30.184
Yeah, as long as
you don't keep asking.

11:30.219 --> 11:32.258
I pay you for
extra protection

11:32.294 --> 11:34.633
and I'm the only place on
the block this happens to?

11:34.669 --> 11:36.708
I'll handle it.
You have my word, Kirby.

11:36.743 --> 11:38.815
Words don't unbreak windows.

11:41.561 --> 11:43.399
We should throw
the poor guy a few bucks.

11:43.435 --> 11:45.340
- Insurance should cover him.
- Yeah, in three months.

11:45.375 --> 11:49.455
We ought to shake down Raul's
crew to tide him over.

11:49.490 --> 11:51.830
Just start the claim-- add
a recommendation to expedite.

11:51.866 --> 11:53.771
Whoa. I look like
the team intern?

11:53.806 --> 11:57.718
No, you look like the only
one who can spell "expedite."

12:03.041 --> 12:04.443
She been acting
jumpy to you?

12:04.479 --> 12:05.447
- Tess?
- Yeah.

12:05.482 --> 12:06.451
No more than usual.

12:06.486 --> 12:08.258
We paying Raul a visit?

12:08.293 --> 12:11.603
No, we already had our powwow,
for whatever good that did.

12:11.639 --> 12:14.481
Think it's time we revoke
his good citizen privileges.

12:14.516 --> 12:16.087
Yeah, well,
let's see him try

12:16.122 --> 12:18.295
to stir things up
without a crew behind him.

12:49.713 --> 12:52.287
Sorry to barge in-- I didn't
see an assistant anywhere.

12:52.323 --> 12:54.562
She insists on taking lunch.
Are you lost?

12:54.598 --> 12:57.105
Special Agent
Robert Stahl, FBI.

12:59.248 --> 13:01.354
Donnie Pomp,
Internal Affairs.

13:01.389 --> 13:03.529
- Wife or mistress?
- Ah. Incline bar.

13:03.564 --> 13:04.633
Mistress is
a better story.

13:04.668 --> 13:07.042
Yeah, tell that
to my ex-wife.

13:07.077 --> 13:10.187
So, uh, what can I--
what can I do for you, Agent--

13:10.222 --> 13:12.093
Stahl. I just wanted
to drop by,

13:12.129 --> 13:13.767
let you know we're in
your backyard and we seem to be

13:13.802 --> 13:15.306
kicking over the same rocks.

13:15.341 --> 13:19.521
Really? Nothing I can think of
warrants federal attention.

13:19.556 --> 13:20.759
Well, it's a few
detectives in the 64th.

13:20.795 --> 13:24.707
Lieutenant Wozniak's unit.

13:24.742 --> 13:27.350
You've got a surveillance
detail on them.

13:27.385 --> 13:29.291
I might.

13:29.326 --> 13:32.269
Well, I'd love to know
what your angle is.

13:32.304 --> 13:33.573
Just a routine
integrity check.

13:33.608 --> 13:35.346
Nothing to waste ink on.

13:35.382 --> 13:36.550
Good. 'Cause
the Bureau needs you

13:36.586 --> 13:38.424
to put that on ice
for a minute.

13:38.459 --> 13:41.536
One of your follow cars was
made the other day, I got word.

13:41.571 --> 13:44.045
You got word, huh?

13:44.081 --> 13:45.651
You got someone
on the inside?

13:47.694 --> 13:50.101
Newton's third law.

13:50.136 --> 13:52.175
Every action has an equal
and opposite reaction.

13:52.211 --> 13:53.480
Hey, come on, we're on
the same side here.

13:53.515 --> 13:55.454
Maybe I can help you out.

13:55.489 --> 13:57.260
Well, it's probably best
if I don't say anything,

13:57.296 --> 14:00.271
and that's nothing
personal, you understand.

14:00.307 --> 14:01.643
- No, of course.
- Tell you what.

14:01.679 --> 14:03.182
If you're serious
about helping out,

14:03.218 --> 14:05.190
the best thing you can do
is call off your dogs.

14:05.226 --> 14:06.696
Consider it done,
but maybe,

14:06.731 --> 14:07.867
as a professional courtesy,
you could let me know

14:07.902 --> 14:10.208
if you find anything
on these guys.

14:10.244 --> 14:11.480
I'll try to quid pro quo.

14:11.516 --> 14:13.119
I can't promise you
anything, Donnie.

14:13.155 --> 14:14.591
Fair enough.

14:20.181 --> 14:21.852
Prick.

14:24.474 --> 14:26.314
Y'all some sorry taggers.

14:26.349 --> 14:28.354
Got evidence all over you.

14:28.389 --> 14:30.261
Caught you red-handed.

14:30.296 --> 14:32.569
Stop resisting!

14:32.606 --> 14:34.309
Yo, we ain't left
our corners.

14:34.345 --> 14:35.447
- Why you going back on the deal?
- What's your name?

14:36.921 --> 14:38.491
Only name you need
to know is Raul.

14:40.300 --> 14:41.938
You can't let these animals
disrespect you, Loman.

14:41.973 --> 14:43.175
I don't have to
act like them either.

14:43.211 --> 14:44.279
They don't see it
as rising above.

14:44.315 --> 14:45.484
You're showing weakness.

14:45.519 --> 14:46.689
You show them
anything but steel,

14:46.724 --> 14:48.829
they're gonna eat you alive.

14:48.865 --> 14:50.403
I'll make you
my official emissary.

14:50.438 --> 14:52.309
With your one phone call,
you're gonna tell Raul

14:52.345 --> 14:54.685
that if he doesn't fall in line,
I'm gonna knock him down.

14:54.720 --> 14:57.061
You got it?

14:57.096 --> 14:59.101
- Get him out of here.
- Come on, come on!

15:02.549 --> 15:05.458
Okay, in the flesh.
What is it?

15:05.493 --> 15:06.996
Wozniak's expecting
a delivery.

15:07.033 --> 15:08.737
What kind of delivery?

15:08.772 --> 15:10.543
I don't know.
He just mentioned it

15:10.579 --> 15:13.153
after he found out
Tufo was being tailed.

15:13.188 --> 15:14.592
Think your shadow's
got him spooked.

15:14.627 --> 15:16.565
They're not my shadows.
They're your shadows.

15:16.601 --> 15:19.576
It's Internal Affairs.

15:19.613 --> 15:22.622
What does IA
want with us?

15:22.657 --> 15:24.495
They investigate
police misconduct

15:24.531 --> 15:27.105
and your crew is
dirtier than dirt.

15:27.140 --> 15:29.112
Don't worry,
I backed them off.

15:33.095 --> 15:34.632
Here's your coffee
and donuts.

15:34.668 --> 15:36.539
I'll be right back
with some fresh cream.

15:36.575 --> 15:38.581
All right, thanks.

15:41.159 --> 15:43.700
What, not your type?

15:43.735 --> 15:46.677
FBI didn't teach you how
to read basic female signals?

15:46.713 --> 15:49.922
She was throwing you major vibe.
You didn't even smile at her.

15:49.957 --> 15:51.595
You see her tip jar there?
It's overflowing,

15:51.631 --> 15:54.874
and the donuts here
aren't that good.

15:54.910 --> 15:56.613
I don't believe you're one
of those good-looking guys

15:56.650 --> 15:58.353
who doesn't know he's
good-looking-- you know.

15:58.389 --> 15:59.692
You screwing with me?

15:59.727 --> 16:01.499
I'm just saying that
if you looked around

16:01.534 --> 16:03.306
and pulled the stick
out of your ass,

16:03.341 --> 16:04.543
you could clean up.

16:06.117 --> 16:07.219
Until I close this case,

16:07.255 --> 16:08.926
you're the only woman
in my life.

16:12.441 --> 16:13.911
Santos.

16:15.853 --> 16:16.955
What?

16:18.129 --> 16:20.402
Where is he?

16:20.437 --> 16:22.677
Not it.

16:22.712 --> 16:24.216
His name is Manny Puentes.

16:24.251 --> 16:26.123
He got pulled over rolling
a stop with a broken tail light.

16:26.158 --> 16:28.900
When I heard it was Cristina's
car, I had him brought here.

16:28.935 --> 16:30.238
Damn it, I just
fixed that car.

16:30.273 --> 16:31.576
Did you get
a hold of her?

16:31.612 --> 16:32.680
No, school wouldn't
put her on.

16:32.716 --> 16:34.086
She's in a practice AP exam.

16:34.121 --> 16:36.561
Well, at least
she's okay, right?

16:36.596 --> 16:37.598
Listen, there's something
else you should know--

16:38.872 --> 16:41.044
Boy, did you steal
the wrong car.

16:41.081 --> 16:42.751
I didn't steal it,
I borrowed it.

16:42.786 --> 16:44.724
I told the other officer
I'd pay for the tail light.

16:44.760 --> 16:46.833
He was gonna call
my girlfriend.

16:46.868 --> 16:48.506
You think
this is no big deal?

16:48.541 --> 16:50.848
I know a judge
who hates car thieves.

16:50.883 --> 16:52.588
Maybe I should
talk to a lawyer.

16:52.623 --> 16:53.892
Ow!

16:53.927 --> 16:56.268
Felony Grand Theft Auto
is five years.

16:56.303 --> 16:57.773
By the time you get out,

16:57.809 --> 17:00.215
you'll be able to rent
your own car, so keep lying.

17:00.251 --> 17:02.156
That's probably her.

17:02.192 --> 17:03.561
My girlfriend.

17:06.205 --> 17:07.675
I'm supposed to pick
her up after school.

17:16.042 --> 17:17.546
Wow, empty theatre.

17:23.369 --> 17:24.973
How's your eye?

17:25.009 --> 17:26.714
Been hit harder
by Girl Scouts.

17:38.894 --> 17:40.364
Heard you had a visitor.

17:40.400 --> 17:42.639
FBI agent said
I'm stepping on his toes

17:42.675 --> 17:45.014
and I should back off.

17:45.050 --> 17:47.925
I put a few surveillance
men on your crew.

17:47.960 --> 17:49.632
- Why would you do that?
- To find the leak.

17:49.667 --> 17:51.672
And this confirms it.
The feds are on to us.

17:51.708 --> 17:53.211
You definitely have
a rat in your house.

17:53.647 --> 17:55.285
Yeah, and there's one
right in front of me.

17:55.321 --> 17:56.992
It wasn't an official detail.
I was just trying to help.

17:57.027 --> 17:58.163
You're too close
to this, Matt.

17:58.198 --> 18:01.006
I want every photo.
Memory cards, too.

18:01.041 --> 18:02.813
You expose me
and my crew again,

18:02.848 --> 18:03.817
I'm gonna do a hell
of a lot more

18:03.852 --> 18:05.121
than give you a bruised eye.

18:05.158 --> 18:06.628
I was just trying
to ease the burden.

18:06.663 --> 18:08.100
Back off.

18:10.544 --> 18:13.051
I'm on to one of my people.

18:13.086 --> 18:15.794
- Who?
- Yeah.

18:15.830 --> 18:17.367
The sooner you
take care of this,

18:17.403 --> 18:21.215
the sooner we can move
forward with the job.

18:21.250 --> 18:23.489
We got heat all over us

18:23.525 --> 18:25.531
and you're still raring to go?

18:25.566 --> 18:28.575
Don't let fear cost you
the payday of a lifetime.

18:36.741 --> 18:39.180
No, no, hey!
Hey!

18:39.217 --> 18:40.586
That's my car!

18:45.740 --> 18:49.720
Son of a bitch takes my car.

18:49.755 --> 18:52.698
You looking for a funeral, Raul?

18:52.733 --> 18:54.638
Son of a bitch!

19:01.309 --> 19:03.048
Harlee, you take
this message?

19:03.084 --> 19:05.791
What? No.

19:05.827 --> 19:07.733
Looks like somebody had
a stroke writing this.

19:07.768 --> 19:09.706
It says your husband's gonna
be late. You're welcome.

19:09.742 --> 19:12.483
Oh, great. Now the bastard
can't even text me.

19:12.518 --> 19:14.290
He's got to lie
through an intermediary.

19:14.325 --> 19:18.907
You guys make dying alone
look better by the day.

19:18.942 --> 19:20.513
Where's Carlos?
I got to get out of here.

19:20.548 --> 19:21.885
I don't know.
I put a dog chip in him, though.

19:21.920 --> 19:24.226
You should check the pound.

19:24.262 --> 19:25.900
We canvassed the local
chop shops for your car.

19:25.935 --> 19:27.338
Hasn't turned up yet.

19:27.374 --> 19:28.476
Tufo hit the scrap yards?

19:28.511 --> 19:30.248
He's still out there.

19:30.284 --> 19:31.587
Are you sure you don't want us
to put out an APB on your car?

19:31.622 --> 19:33.294
Raul's gonna need
his product more.

19:33.329 --> 19:34.565
Go sit on the mortuary.

19:34.600 --> 19:36.639
He's gonna stick
his neck out eventually.

19:37.946 --> 19:39.081
Where's Tess going?

19:58.556 --> 20:00.895
- It's 2:00.
- I thought it'd be nice.

20:00.931 --> 20:03.806
- Well, we're still on duty.
- How about some tunes?

20:03.842 --> 20:06.349
My God. Why are you acting
like this is your first time?

20:06.384 --> 20:08.089
Please tell me it's not.

20:08.124 --> 20:10.063
I just want you
to be comfortable.

20:10.098 --> 20:12.572
I am comfortable.
Now come here.

20:15.016 --> 20:16.486
Is that Manhattan?

20:16.522 --> 20:18.159
He took her to Manhattan.

20:18.195 --> 20:19.899
- That's the High Line.
- Hey.

20:21.273 --> 20:22.876
Heard you had
a rough morning.

20:22.913 --> 20:24.984
Nothing like
this afternoon.

20:25.020 --> 20:27.192
A patrol caught him
driving Cristina's car.

20:27.228 --> 20:29.869
- He broke her taillight.
- Any priors?

20:29.904 --> 20:32.813
Worse.
This is his phone.

20:32.848 --> 20:34.620
Oh.
Take it this the first

20:34.655 --> 20:35.691
you're hearing about
a boyfriend.

20:35.726 --> 20:37.698
That loser
is not her boyfriend.

20:37.734 --> 20:39.404
That's a lapse in judgment.

20:39.440 --> 20:41.044
At least he's
not a car thief.

20:41.080 --> 20:43.319
Car's in my name and
I didn't say he could drive it,

20:43.355 --> 20:44.858
so I'm charging him.

20:44.893 --> 20:47.200
Look, I'm already drowning
in this drug seizure.

20:47.235 --> 20:49.208
Show an overworked
public servant some mercy.

20:49.243 --> 20:51.416
Let me throw a good
scare into him instead.

20:51.451 --> 20:54.026
You're not exactly
"bad cop" material.

20:54.061 --> 20:58.241
I'll use scary words,
like "punitive damages,"

20:58.276 --> 21:00.449
"incarceration."

21:00.484 --> 21:05.099
No, I want weeping
or pants-wetting, or no deal.

21:05.135 --> 21:06.906
I'll do my best.

21:09.083 --> 21:10.921
Hello.

21:10.956 --> 21:14.233
I'm Assistant District
Attorney James Nava.

21:14.268 --> 21:15.337
What's your name?

21:15.372 --> 21:16.943
Manny Puentes.

21:16.979 --> 21:18.616
I told that cop lady
I didn't steal the car

21:18.651 --> 21:21.259
but she won't listen,
and she stole my phone.

21:21.294 --> 21:24.873
You happen to catch that
cop lady's last name?

21:24.908 --> 21:26.545
Santos.

21:28.420 --> 21:30.527
Oh, I'm a dead man.

21:30.562 --> 21:31.932
You really like this girl?

21:31.967 --> 21:34.174
Absolutely, for real.

21:34.209 --> 21:35.612
All right.

21:35.648 --> 21:37.318
You say exactly what
I tell you to say,

21:37.354 --> 21:39.193
maybe I can get you
out of this alive.

21:39.228 --> 21:43.040
Start with "Detective Santos,
I really like your daughter."

21:44.480 --> 21:46.955
I wouldn't get
too worked up.

21:46.990 --> 21:50.099
Kids are losing their
v-cards later these days.

21:50.134 --> 21:52.274
It's all about
mouth business.

21:52.309 --> 21:54.047
Nice, safe mouth business.

21:54.083 --> 21:55.385
Are you looking to
get shot in the face?

21:55.420 --> 21:58.162
No, I'm just saying.
I saw it on Dateline.

21:58.198 --> 21:59.668
You ever hear
of a rainbow party?

22:10.978 --> 22:12.415
Mmm.

22:12.450 --> 22:16.864
You get Cristina
one of them HVV shots yet?

22:22.555 --> 22:23.757
Are you sleeping
with my daughter?

22:23.792 --> 22:25.731
No.

22:25.766 --> 22:27.371
- Are you sure about that?
- No.

22:27.406 --> 22:29.411
I mean yes.
Yes, I'm sure.

22:29.446 --> 22:31.586
Are you sleeping with her?

22:34.331 --> 22:37.106
I really like
your daughter.

22:37.142 --> 22:38.310
Harlee! Take it easy.

23:06.115 --> 23:07.987
Does housekeeping
knock that loud?

23:08.022 --> 23:10.931
- Open the damn door.
- Oh, Woz.

23:10.966 --> 23:12.838
You didn't tell him
we were here, did you?

23:12.874 --> 23:14.979
Yeah, I told him I was
gonna bang my idiot partner

23:15.015 --> 23:16.653
and then I invited
him to watch.

23:25.353 --> 23:26.890
Get dressed,
get back to work.

23:26.925 --> 23:30.135
You, my car, one minute.

23:34.487 --> 23:37.529
Espada?
What the hell you thinking?

23:37.564 --> 23:39.938
Nothing.
That was the point.

23:39.974 --> 23:41.444
First you want
to sell drugs,

23:41.479 --> 23:42.715
now you're stepping out
on your husband?

23:42.750 --> 23:43.886
What's going on with you?

23:43.921 --> 23:45.793
It's none of
your business, okay?

23:45.829 --> 23:50.444
You ride in my crew, I need
to know your head's straight.

23:50.479 --> 23:52.451
Joe's cheating on me.

23:55.498 --> 23:57.403
You know this for sure?

23:57.438 --> 24:00.246
Woz, I'm losing my family.

24:00.282 --> 24:02.121
I don't know how
to fix this.

24:02.156 --> 24:03.492
Picked a hell of a way
to try.

24:06.471 --> 24:08.410
You think
I should leave him?

24:08.446 --> 24:12.994
Tess, men are dogs.

24:13.029 --> 24:18.313
Dog pisses on the rug,
you swat it with the newspaper.

24:18.348 --> 24:21.893
If the pissing
becomes habitual,

24:21.929 --> 24:24.268
start looking for a farm.

24:25.776 --> 24:27.849
Okay.

24:27.884 --> 24:29.957
I'm sorry, sweetie.

24:34.877 --> 24:36.949
Hey, you're not gonna
tell anyone right?

24:36.985 --> 24:39.525
Not if it ends today, no.

24:39.561 --> 24:41.399
Okay.

24:43.709 --> 24:45.413
Is anybody working today
or what?

24:45.449 --> 24:47.554
Uh, we're just waiting
on the tow truck, Lieutenant.

24:47.590 --> 24:49.663
Someone dropped
your rig off, Boss.

24:49.698 --> 24:52.908
I love the new color.
Really brings out your vagina.

24:52.944 --> 24:56.354
Hey, does Linda know
you're into dark meat?

24:56.389 --> 24:58.227
Come on.

24:58.263 --> 25:00.302
My wife gave me
that subscription.

25:01.843 --> 25:03.513
You guys gonna watch me
jerk off or what?

25:03.549 --> 25:06.792
- Oh, I'm not busy.
- Let's go, back to work.

25:33.892 --> 25:35.030
Finally gonna follow
your dream

25:35.109 --> 25:38.757
of becoming a Mary Kay lady?

25:38.794 --> 25:40.899
No, I'm saving that as
a treat for when I retire.

25:40.934 --> 25:43.542
That's a paint job
from Raul.

25:43.577 --> 25:44.914
What kind of thank you note
you going to send?

25:44.949 --> 25:46.754
Tess was right-- this would
all be ancient history

25:46.789 --> 25:48.226
if I'd just broke off
a little piece of the haul

25:48.261 --> 25:49.531
and gave it to him.

25:49.567 --> 25:50.902
No, word gets out
that you did Raul a favor,

25:50.938 --> 25:52.844
then everybody
wants the same.

25:52.879 --> 25:54.483
If it means
keeping the peace,

25:54.518 --> 25:56.256
then I'm gonna
take that risk.

25:56.291 --> 25:57.560
You start moving those lines,
eventually you forget

25:57.596 --> 25:59.167
why you drew them
in the first place.

25:59.202 --> 26:02.445
Harlee, I can't fight
wars on multiple fronts.

26:02.481 --> 26:04.988
I only got one set of eyes
in the back of my head,

26:05.023 --> 26:07.397
and they're
looking for a knife.

26:07.432 --> 26:11.044
Then maybe,
just this once,

26:11.079 --> 26:13.613
you let somebody else
do the fighting for you.

26:14.856 --> 26:15.984
You know--

26:16.837 --> 26:19.545
Do me a favor.
Put this back in evidence.

26:19.581 --> 26:21.318
Gladly.

26:21.354 --> 26:23.761
- What are you gonna do?
- I'm gonna find a soldier.

26:27.073 --> 26:29.613
Detective Santos.
Manny has graciously agreed

26:29.649 --> 26:31.788
not to press
assault charges.

26:31.824 --> 26:33.762
You know where I live?

26:33.797 --> 26:36.472
Yeah, of course you do.

26:36.507 --> 26:39.115
Car's over there.
Drive straight there, no stops.

26:39.151 --> 26:40.688
You understand?

26:40.723 --> 26:42.093
I'm really sorry, ma'am.
I want you to know

26:42.129 --> 26:43.699
I really like
and respect Cristina.

26:43.734 --> 26:45.071
Well, then you won't
want to upset her

26:45.106 --> 26:46.643
by telling her about this.

26:50.660 --> 26:53.268
Is it the boy
or the situation?

26:53.303 --> 26:55.341
Both.

26:55.377 --> 26:58.687
Me and Cristina never
had secrets between us.

26:58.722 --> 27:00.026
This is a big one.

27:00.061 --> 27:04.141
Yep. Tell your parents
everything when you were 16?

27:04.176 --> 27:08.056
No. But I bet you did.

27:08.091 --> 27:10.632
Followed all the rules
in the Boy Scout handbook?

27:10.667 --> 27:13.944
- Eagle Scout.
- Of course you were.

27:13.980 --> 27:16.319
Well, it's nice to have one
around when you need it.

27:16.355 --> 27:17.658
You can owe me one.

27:19.199 --> 27:20.602
One what?

27:26.158 --> 27:27.762
- What did he say?
- Who?

27:27.797 --> 27:30.238
Who? Father Christmas.
Who do you think?

27:30.273 --> 27:32.111
He said don't
screw where you eat.

27:32.147 --> 27:33.249
Well, that's expected.

27:33.284 --> 27:34.420
So how do you want
to play it?

27:34.455 --> 27:35.892
How do I want
to play what?

27:35.927 --> 27:37.196
Getting out of here.

27:37.232 --> 27:38.435
We got the hotel room
for 18 more hours.

27:38.470 --> 27:40.876
Seriously?
God.

27:40.912 --> 27:43.018
What? What?

27:44.960 --> 27:46.397
How stupid are you?

27:46.432 --> 27:47.869
Apparently pretty damn stupid.

27:47.904 --> 27:49.809
Two hours ago you were
begging to have sex with me.

27:49.845 --> 27:50.981
Begging? You were practically
humping my leg

27:51.017 --> 27:52.553
before we got in the room.

27:52.589 --> 27:53.824
Oh yeah? What happened to
"Put your hands on me"?

27:53.860 --> 27:54.795
Put my hands on you?
Huh?

27:54.830 --> 27:56.669
You want my hands on you?

27:56.704 --> 27:58.308
My boss just pulled me
off of you half-naked,

27:58.343 --> 27:59.680
telling me that
I'd better knock it off.

27:59.715 --> 28:01.386
So that is exactly
what I'm gonna do.

28:01.422 --> 28:03.795
In what bizarro world
is this my fault?

28:03.830 --> 28:05.635
Remember you came on to me.

28:07.477 --> 28:09.717
Woz is right.
You're all the same.

28:09.752 --> 28:11.423
Don't lump me in there
with your husband, all right?

28:11.459 --> 28:12.694
That son of a bitch
takes you for granted.

28:12.730 --> 28:15.237
And who's there for you, huh?
Me.

28:15.272 --> 28:17.312
I don't need you to be.

28:24.775 --> 28:26.378
Señor Wozniak.
Sit down.

28:26.414 --> 28:28.921
Let Devonte treat you
to a spit polish.

28:28.956 --> 28:30.326
- Leon, take care of this--
- Nah, I'm not here

28:30.362 --> 28:32.333
to get my feet tickled,
thanks.

28:33.607 --> 28:35.077
We've kept our promise.

28:35.113 --> 28:37.018
My boys have been
on their best behavior.

28:38.960 --> 28:40.966
That's why I'm here.

28:41.001 --> 28:43.944
Some prime real estate
is about to open up,

28:43.979 --> 28:46.553
and I think you've earned it.

28:46.589 --> 28:49.430
- What you want for it?
- Just follow the rules.

28:49.465 --> 28:52.140
No business outside
designated corners.

28:52.176 --> 28:54.683
If your crew starts to stray,
you pull them back.

28:54.719 --> 28:59.099
If I have to do it, deal's off--
you lose everything.

28:59.135 --> 29:03.215
If I'm eating the beef,
I want to know whose cow it is.

29:03.250 --> 29:06.727
- Raul Mendez.
- Oh, hell no.

29:06.763 --> 29:11.077
Boy's crazy, burning bodies
all damn day.

29:11.112 --> 29:13.587
I'm too pretty to be
cooked up in his oven.

29:13.622 --> 29:16.263
You and I are gonna make sure
that doesn't happen.

29:21.116 --> 29:23.054
You interested or not?

29:26.402 --> 29:28.776
- Hey.
- What a surprise.

29:28.811 --> 29:33.259
- Come in.
- Wow, you look incredible.

29:33.294 --> 29:36.705
Perfect timing.
You mind?

29:36.740 --> 29:38.478
Oh, sure.

29:43.265 --> 29:45.471
Obrigada.

29:45.506 --> 29:48.114
You got a hot date
tonight or something?

29:48.149 --> 29:50.054
Are you serious?

29:50.090 --> 29:51.326
Right, sorry.

29:51.361 --> 29:53.366
I, um, realized I didn't
pay you earlier,

29:53.402 --> 29:57.147
and I didn't want you to send
your manager to break my legs.

29:57.182 --> 29:59.122
I have something
for you too.

29:59.157 --> 30:03.170
My friend Marco owns
a restaurant called Tropical.

30:03.205 --> 30:05.678
He can teach you
to cook Brazilian food.

30:05.714 --> 30:07.017
For your date.

30:07.052 --> 30:08.689
I don't know.
Last time I touched a stove,

30:08.726 --> 30:09.827
I lost an eyebrow.

30:09.863 --> 30:11.768
Your girl will love it,

30:11.804 --> 30:15.448
and it will only cost you $150.

30:15.484 --> 30:18.359
That's a lot of dough
for a cooking class.

30:18.395 --> 30:21.404
I've charged a lot more
for a lot less.

30:24.718 --> 30:28.965
I'm expecting a home cooked meal
in return for the tip.

30:29.000 --> 30:32.377
If I don't poison the first
girl, consider it a date.

30:39.205 --> 30:40.775
Killer view.

30:43.119 --> 30:44.924
Still gonna need
a roof over your head.

30:44.959 --> 30:46.530
Oh, enough with
that already.

30:46.565 --> 30:48.738
You saved my life.

30:48.774 --> 30:50.612
Apps loaded.
You're all set.

30:52.086 --> 30:54.592
At least let me give you
a couple bucks.

30:54.628 --> 30:59.511
If you're hell-bent
on giving me something,

30:59.547 --> 31:01.552
how about an explanation?

31:09.684 --> 31:11.355
Where did you get these?

31:11.391 --> 31:13.162
I think you already know.

31:15.572 --> 31:19.619
Trust me, he ain't gonna miss 'em--
dude's got stacks.

31:19.654 --> 31:22.195
This doesn't look
like Internal Affairs.

31:22.230 --> 31:25.273
So who is it?
FBI?

31:25.308 --> 31:28.418
No, I'm on a joint task force.
I can't talk about it.

31:30.093 --> 31:32.165
It's been a while
since I wore a badge,

31:32.201 --> 31:39.593
but last I remember we surveil
targets, not each other.

31:39.628 --> 31:41.533
If you're working for the
feds, it ain't by choice.

31:41.568 --> 31:44.243
They're squeezing you.

31:44.279 --> 31:46.819
You're not my training
officer anymore, Caddie.

31:46.855 --> 31:51.303
Yeah. Let you down
on that one.

31:51.338 --> 31:55.083
I can get you into rehab
at St. Joseph's, you know that.

31:55.119 --> 31:57.292
If I ever change my mind,
you'll be the first to know.

31:57.327 --> 32:00.571
Come on, Caddie. When was
the last time you had 20 days?

32:00.606 --> 32:03.012
When was the last time
you were honest?

32:05.457 --> 32:07.630
I'll leave you to it then.

32:09.137 --> 32:12.080
Eight years vice
undercover taught me

32:12.115 --> 32:15.927
that living between two worlds
comes with a price.

32:15.962 --> 32:19.607
The paranoia makes you
second guess every decision.

32:19.643 --> 32:22.886
Then the secrets and lies
chip away at you

32:22.921 --> 32:25.261
till there's nothing left.

32:26.936 --> 32:29.711
Bet the drugs didn't help.

32:29.746 --> 32:33.960
Main line helps me rise above.

32:33.996 --> 32:35.599
I get the appeal.

32:43.430 --> 32:46.607
Eight years.

32:46.642 --> 32:49.618
I don't think
I can last eight days.

32:51.695 --> 32:54.536
I thought I knew
whose side I was on.

32:56.479 --> 32:59.187
Now I don't know who to trust.

32:59.222 --> 33:02.834
And I hate them both
for taking that away from me.

33:06.282 --> 33:08.889
The only thing I do know is that
when Cristina finds out

33:08.925 --> 33:10.395
who I really am...

33:14.278 --> 33:16.250
I'm gonna lose her.

33:18.192 --> 33:22.004
So I just keep thinking that
if I can hold on long enough...

33:24.950 --> 33:27.726
somehow there's a play
where I get out

33:27.761 --> 33:29.834
without my daughter
being ashamed.

34:02.891 --> 34:04.227
Thought you got wrapped up
with everyone else.

34:04.263 --> 34:07.975
- Cops let me go.
- Why would they do that?

34:08.010 --> 34:10.885
Give you a message.
Let's go.

34:12.493 --> 34:14.532
This ends now!

34:21.493 --> 34:23.364
Welcome back.

34:25.876 --> 34:27.880
I needed you
to hear me, homie.

34:27.916 --> 34:30.223
And you thought
the best way to do that

34:30.259 --> 34:34.940
was to steal my pride,
because why?

34:34.975 --> 34:40.194
Because a man's pride is
all that really matters.

34:40.228 --> 34:42.201
We could still
work something out.

34:42.235 --> 34:45.212
I'm the only one
who knows what's up.

34:45.246 --> 34:49.428
Problem is,
you're under the assumption

34:49.463 --> 34:53.710
that I'm not proud
of a certain part of myself.

34:53.745 --> 34:58.293
Yeah, 'cause if I was you,
I couldn't look in the mirror.

34:58.329 --> 35:01.873
I have large appetites.

35:01.908 --> 35:04.516
I like a full menu.

35:04.551 --> 35:06.658
Variety.

35:08.065 --> 35:11.275
Look, man, I'll forget
what I know.

35:11.311 --> 35:13.918
No, you won't.

35:13.953 --> 35:16.160
You're not gonna talk
about it either.

35:16.195 --> 35:20.810
You're going away,
and you're gonna stay away.

35:20.845 --> 35:24.357
All you got on me
is a gangbanger's word.

35:24.392 --> 35:29.108
And what I'm gonna have on you
is video.

35:35.132 --> 35:39.211
Wozniak, don't you leave.

35:39.247 --> 35:41.520
You can't do this,
do you hear me?

35:41.555 --> 35:43.160
Wozniak!

35:43.195 --> 35:44.464
Hope you don't have
a gag reflex, dawg.

35:44.499 --> 35:46.204
Especially with
what I'm packing.

35:46.239 --> 35:48.914
Car's gonna be out back
when you're done.

35:48.949 --> 35:51.189
You know what they say, Raul.

35:51.224 --> 35:53.363
You never go back.

36:19.076 --> 36:22.052
<i>Dear Cristina, I keep
writing you these letters,</i>

36:22.088 --> 36:23.993
<i>even though you've never
written back,</i>

36:24.028 --> 36:25.531
<i>because I like to think
that you're reading them.</i>

36:25.567 --> 36:29.178
Hey, Mom.

36:29.214 --> 36:30.952
What was that?

36:30.987 --> 36:32.792
Nothing.
You scared me.

36:32.827 --> 36:34.766
Why are you
hiding the mail?

36:34.801 --> 36:36.706
Oh, um.

36:36.741 --> 36:38.981
It's your tuition bill.

36:39.016 --> 36:40.621
I didn't want you
to die of shock.

36:40.656 --> 36:42.260
Mm-hmm.

36:42.295 --> 36:43.230
Why are you
acting so sketchy?

36:43.266 --> 36:45.405
I saw your taillight.

36:45.441 --> 36:46.676
Okay, saying random things

36:46.712 --> 36:48.450
is not helping with
the sketch factor.

36:48.485 --> 36:50.558
Your car, the taillight.
It's broken.

36:50.593 --> 36:52.330
What happened?

36:52.367 --> 36:54.271
Okay, I looked away
for like one second

36:54.307 --> 36:56.412
and backed into a post.

36:56.448 --> 36:57.684
I'm already mad
enough at myself.

36:57.719 --> 36:59.457
You don't have to be, too.

36:59.493 --> 37:01.766
Your school lot
doesn't have posts.

37:01.801 --> 37:03.238
I didn't say it did.

37:03.273 --> 37:05.211
We got froyo after school.

37:05.247 --> 37:07.253
I'm not asking for money
to fix it or anything.

37:07.288 --> 37:10.264
I'll just pick up some extra
babysitting hours this weekend.

37:16.890 --> 37:19.999
I have a couple chapters
to finish before bed.

37:20.035 --> 37:21.237
Night.

37:33.049 --> 37:36.326
Is this everything from your
Internal Affairs surveillance?

37:36.362 --> 37:38.233
Detail was only
on 'em a couple of days.

37:48.607 --> 37:50.378
Where is this?

37:50.414 --> 37:51.482
It's Flatbush, I think.

37:51.518 --> 37:53.222
And this?

37:53.258 --> 37:55.464
It's Crown Heights.

38:02.057 --> 38:05.969
- Are these times accurate?
- Is there a problem?

38:06.005 --> 38:07.977
Saperstein said
he was with Tufo

38:08.013 --> 38:10.820
when he spotted your guy.

38:10.856 --> 38:12.494
If "with him"
means three miles away.

38:12.529 --> 38:13.932
Exactly.

38:21.061 --> 38:23.802
You gonna love Philly, papi.

38:23.838 --> 38:26.378
City of Brotherly Love.

38:26.413 --> 38:29.858
<i>Hermanos de amor. Si?</i>

38:34.543 --> 38:36.215
How about some music, man?

39:53.503 --> 39:56.344
You were right, Caddie.

39:56.379 --> 39:58.953
I am paranoid.

40:01.432 --> 40:07.385
<i>I, uh,
I thought maybe we could--</i>

40:07.420 --> 40:09.258
Well, maybe we could
have some dinner.

40:11.268 --> 40:13.273
<i>Get a little dinner.</i>

40:16.654 --> 40:18.526
<i>Hi.</i>

40:18.561 --> 40:20.667
<i>Wow, you look incredible.</i>

40:22.543 --> 40:25.786
<i>Hoping we could
get something to eat.</i>

40:25.822 --> 40:28.731
<i>I was hoping maybe
we could get something to eat.</i>

40:28.766 --> 40:30.538
<i>All right, what do you say we,
you know,</i>

40:30.573 --> 40:33.482
<i>get, like, a little something
to eat or something?</i>

40:33.517 --> 40:35.288
<i>Get a little something to eat.</i>

40:35.324 --> 40:39.370
<i>Get a little bite to eat.
Bite to eat, bite.</i>

40:42.785 --> 40:44.455
<i>Yeah, it's open.</i>

40:44.490 --> 40:46.295
<i>I'm glad you called.</i>

40:46.331 --> 40:47.767
<i>I could use a little fun
tonight.</i>

40:47.803 --> 40:49.641
<i>Yeah.</i>

40:53.558 --> 40:56.467
<i>Wow, you look incredible.</i>

41:04.599 --> 41:06.470
I was thinking maybe we could
get something to eat.

41:06.506 --> 41:09.983
- I made reservations.
- That sounds nice.

41:11.625 --> 41:13.162
But the $500 is for one hour.

41:13.197 --> 41:15.503
Anything more is the same rate.
That all right?

41:15.539 --> 41:19.652
For the pleasure of your
company, absolutely.

41:19.687 --> 41:23.065
Great. Then let's go eat.

41:23.101 --> 41:26.912
- What's your name?
- Anything you want it to be.

41:26.948 --> 41:30.458
Let's try Harlee.
