- Hey, what about us?
- Bill!

43:50.419 --> 43:53.207
- You go there, that's all our asses.
- You can't go to town.

43:57.301 --> 43:59.793
You go to that union with that $3,000,
that's all our asses.

43:59.887 --> 44:01.048
What do you care? It's my share.

44:01.097 --> 44:02.212
What do you mean your share?

44:02.265 --> 44:04.723
They're gonna come back and get us.
Don't you understand that?

44:04.767 --> 44:06.883
Why don't you do it some other time?

44:07.937 --> 44:09.723
You expect us to be here
when you get back?

44:09.814 --> 44:13.557
- We're not gonna be here. Right, Bertha?
- I'll be here.

44:34.297 --> 44:37.380
I'll be damned, Shelly.
They told me you was dead.

44:37.425 --> 44:39.132
They told me they hired sheriff's boys...

44:39.218 --> 44:43.257
You can't believe anything a cop tells you.
Even something good.

44:43.306 --> 44:46.674
Listen, did anyone know
you were coming up this way?

44:46.767 --> 44:50.305
Hell, no. Just my police escort.
Didn't you hear the sirens?

44:50.396 --> 44:54.014
Oh, don't come all smart with me.
They got a price on your head.

44:54.108 --> 44:56.270
You and them nuts you busted out with.

44:56.319 --> 45:00.438
Whores and niggers. My God,
ain't that a nice image for unionism?

45:00.531 --> 45:05.492
Well, here. I reckon
this'll clean up the image some, huh?

45:10.499 --> 45:14.208
It's marked. You know it's marked.
They mark it nowadays.

45:14.295 --> 45:16.832
Tiny little mark. They can tell every bill.

45:16.923 --> 45:20.291
Joe, try not to be no dumber
than you was born to be.

45:20.968 --> 45:23.175
It's okay. Hell, it's money.

45:24.096 --> 45:26.884
You're hotter than
a deep-bowled stove, boy!

45:26.974 --> 45:31.138
Do us a favor, stay away from here.
The union has got to preserve...

45:31.229 --> 45:34.597
- You mean, you don't need my money?
- I didn't say that.

45:34.649 --> 45:37.061
It's appreciated. It's appreciated.

45:37.151 --> 45:39.142
Look, hitting a scab is one thing.

45:39.237 --> 45:42.980
But robbing the damn mail,
that's something else, ain't it?

45:44.033 --> 45:45.398
Yeah, I guess it is.

45:49.872 --> 45:53.661
Just see that stuff
gets in the strike fund, you hear?

45:54.210 --> 45:57.544
- All you socialist bastards are just alike.
- In the strike fund!

45:57.630 --> 45:59.041
Anything gges

46:09.934 --> 46:11.174
What are you doing with that dog?

46:13.145 --> 46:15.182
What's it look like I'm doing? I'm feeding' it.

46:16.649 --> 46:17.684
Oh.

46:20.194 --> 46:22.151
I had a dog in New York once.

46:22.196 --> 46:23.982
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

46:24.699 --> 46:26.906
What'd you do? Lose him in a crap game?

46:26.993 --> 46:29.485
No, as a matter of fact
I didn't lose him in a crap game.

46:31.998 --> 46:33.739
He started a union.

46:39.880 --> 46:41.041
Bill?

46:42.174 --> 46:43.289
What?

46:44.719 --> 46:46.710
It's gonna be all right.

46:47.388 --> 46:50.597
Sure. Union don't want me.

46:50.975 --> 46:55.890
Railroad goes on starving kids,
busting heads, making money.

46:56.564 --> 46:58.054
And I'm here.

46:59.066 --> 47:02.775
Bill, to get back at the Reader,
you don't need no union.

47:04.196 --> 47:05.402
Ain't that so, Rake?

47:05.823 --> 47:09.612
You don't need no union
to go for more Reader payrolls.

47:09.702 --> 47:12.364
Yeah. Payrolls, ticket offices...

47:16.751 --> 47:18.708
What else we gonna do?

47:37.104 --> 47:41.268
Put an extra $10 in them pay envelopes.
Just keep calm, and keep working.

47:41.317 --> 47:43.058
Don't you do anything funny now.

48:21.607 --> 48:24.645
You want to just put something
on the tray, ma'am?

48:24.735 --> 48:27.727
Yes, ma'am, that's fine.
That's fine, thank you.

48:27.822 --> 48:30.154
And you, sir, you got
something here for me?

48:30.199 --> 48:33.863
Thank you. Oh, my goodness!
Oh, that's... Thank you.

48:35.162 --> 48:37.995
Y'all sure was nice to this old nigger.
What you got for me, ma'am?

48:38.040 --> 48:40.247
That's a nice-looking watch
you got on there.

48:40.334 --> 48:42.575
Uh-huh, yes, ma'am, all that's good.

48:42.670 --> 48:47.460
Uh-uh, all that. Yes, yes. Thank you.
You ain't got nothing for me, huh?

48:47.508 --> 48:50.967
Oh, my goodness. How about you?
You got something for this old nigger?

48:51.011 --> 48:55.050
Thank you, I'm doing real well here.
Thank you, ma'am, that's very kind.

Let's just keep going, huh?

49:22.209 --> 49:24.246
You take care of the others, Rake.

49:31.093 --> 49:33.380
Get over there. Watch it, now.

49:35.264 --> 49:38.131
- Okay, now, drop that.
- Move over.

49:41.520 --> 49:42.851
Put them down.

49:46.775 --> 49:48.516
I'll just take those, boys.

51:02.309 --> 51:03.515
Now up.

51:05.312 --> 51:09.146
-(LAUGHS) Fast. Fast.
- Come on, Bertha, get on with it.

51:09.692 --> 51:12.354
Stand up. Up. Up. Down.

51:13.112 --> 51:14.477
Up. Get up.

Sit!

Well, how many?

51:37.261 --> 51:41.676
Well, they've got four bosses,
but they got plenty of others.

51:43.058 --> 51:45.390
What about that commie
son of a bitch Shelly?

51:45.477 --> 51:48.845
He used to plague me with wildcat strikes.
What about him?

51:49.565 --> 51:52.353
- He gets his orders from abroad.
- Of course.

51:52.943 --> 51:55.685
We got more than a security problem here.

51:55.738 --> 51:58.526
We know how to handle him
when we get him, don't we?

51:58.574 --> 52:01.032
And it'll be the exception, won't it?

Brown? What about him?

He would... He'd cook you.

and I got myself a situation.

- Ain't there another man with him?
- Uh, just a nigger.

52:40.407 --> 52:41.522
Oh.

tell me about this here Boxcar Bertha?

I ain't done an honest day's work in months.

I think it's honest work.

a little piece of fortune coming.
