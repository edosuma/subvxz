Come on, come on.
Answer your phone.

I want our citizens
to have confidence in us.

While the military which
I have immediately ordered

01:53.200 --> 01:55.854
into emergency action,
finishes their duties.

01:57.117 --> 01:58.770
We are there to help working--

01:58.944 --> 02:00.729
Damn bureaucrats!

02:00.903 --> 02:02.296
Would you answer your phone!

02:07.779 --> 02:08.954
Robert for Johnny?

Johnny, come back.

Yeah. Yeah, uh,
where the hell is Johnny?

house to grab more supplies.

02:28.974 --> 02:30.454
I heard you was up
at the hospital.

02:30.628 --> 02:32.630

I'm telling you, man.

Can you come back for me?

02:52.128 --> 02:53.260
I'm waiting on Big John.

02:53.434 --> 02:54.739
What do you think?

02:54.913 --> 02:56.350
He should be back

Robert Miller of Miller Motors.

04:00.501 --> 04:02.067
Leave me a message.

04:02.242 --> 04:03.460

Lex?

04:32.097 --> 04:33.534
You ready?

04:33.708 --> 04:36.406
- Almost!
Still gotta make my tea though.

04:36.580 --> 04:39.104
- I already made it for you
and I packed your bag.

04:41.498 --> 04:43.239
And I confirmed
with the canoe rental,

04:43.413 --> 04:44.806
they want us to be there
in an hour and a half.

04:44.980 --> 04:47.983
So, we should be leaving... now.

04:48.157 --> 04:49.854
- Be right there.
Just gotta brush my teeth.

05:06.871 --> 05:08.395

little buddy.

05:10.353 --> 05:11.833
You're gonna need
to get you meals

05:12.007 --> 05:14.357
wherever else you've been
roaming for the next week.

05:14.531 --> 05:15.706
I'll be on a trip.

05:15.880 --> 05:19.580
[birds chirping]

05:19.754 --> 05:21.495
Ah, you'll be fine, won't you?

05:21.669 --> 05:24.411
You're out there
doing your own thing.

05:26.195 --> 05:27.327
You don't need any help.

05:34.769 --> 05:36.466
What do you say?

05:36.640 --> 05:38.207
You wanna trade with me?

05:38.381 --> 05:39.948
You go on a canoe trip and

05:40.122 --> 05:42.167
I'll hang out here
in the neighborhood by myself?

05:48.173 --> 05:49.218
Yeah, I don't blame you.

05:54.310 --> 05:56.312
Alex! You coming or what?

06:04.102 --> 06:07.279
- And remember things seem
to be uh, improving,

06:07.454 --> 06:09.891
but we have seen
with these events,

06:10.065 --> 06:11.632
how quickly uh,

06:11.806 --> 06:12.937
it can turn
from a manageable situation--

06:13.111 --> 06:14.591
[Alex sighs]

06:14.765 --> 06:15.984
TIRED GOVERNOR:
...to an overwhelming outbreak.

06:16.158 --> 06:17.899
- Should we still be doing this?

06:18.073 --> 06:19.683
- TIRED GOVERNOR: ...My office
are staying diligent...

06:19.857 --> 06:21.642
- You are not getting out of it.

06:21.816 --> 06:23.078
- I'm not trying to get out of--

06:23.252 --> 06:25.210
- You can't keep
running away from this.

06:25.385 --> 06:27.038
We had a deal.
- I wasn't trying

06:27.212 --> 06:28.562
to get out of it, I was--
- And you have to hold up your

06:28.736 --> 06:29.867
end and actually give this
a shot.

06:30.041 --> 06:31.695
Not just go
through the motions.

06:31.869 --> 06:36.004
You promised five days alone
to focus on us.

06:36.178 --> 06:40.356
- TIRED GOVERNOR: ...the latest
9.6% versus 12.6%...

06:40.530 --> 06:42.880
We have no hope to fix this

06:43.054 --> 06:44.491
if you just keep
pushing me away.

06:44.665 --> 06:46.057
- TIRED GOVERNOR:
...From the week before.

06:46.231 --> 06:47.407
I'm sorry the day before.

06:49.147 --> 06:51.019
Now what I was saying about
our most densely populated areas

06:51.193 --> 06:54.675
was that uh, the link we saw
over the past two days,

06:54.849 --> 06:56.154
now if we took back the...
[indistinct speech]

06:56.328 --> 06:57.765
As you can see...

07:23.878 --> 07:24.618
- Whoa, easy!

07:24.792 --> 07:26.576
- I'm fine.

07:27.316 --> 07:29.623
- Well, just be careful moving
around like that,

07:29.797 --> 07:30.754
'cause you could end up tip--

07:30.928 --> 07:31.755
- I'm not gonna tip the boat.

07:39.894 --> 07:41.809
How you doing?

07:41.983 --> 07:42.984
- Great.

07:44.594 --> 07:45.726
- You seem a little tense.

07:48.119 --> 07:49.469
- It's just um...

07:52.167 --> 07:53.516
This is the closest I've been
to being back home

07:53.690 --> 07:54.648
in a long time.

09:19.167 --> 09:20.951
[chuckles]

09:21.125 --> 09:22.518
You're really cute.

09:40.536 --> 09:41.798
- ALEX: Jaime?

09:43.931 --> 09:45.628
Jaime!

09:45.802 --> 09:47.369
Where are you?

09:47.543 --> 09:48.718
- I'll be right there.

[metal clink]

10:02.123 --> 10:03.298
Hello?

10:17.965 --> 10:19.009
Is someone there?

10:24.928 --> 10:26.016
Hello?

10:30.194 --> 10:32.327
Alex, is that you?

10:41.684 --> 10:45.514
[gasping]

10:45.688 --> 10:48.865
Oh. You scared me, little guy.

10:52.564 --> 10:56.525
I guess you're the one
who's scared here, huh?

11:41.309 --> 11:42.702
[sighs]

12:26.658 --> 12:30.097
[eerie music]

12:30.358 --> 12:32.229

12:42.022 --> 12:45.677
[indistinct announcement]

12:50.726 --> 12:52.293
- Jamie.

12:54.991 --> 12:56.427
I'm so sorry.

12:56.601 --> 12:58.560
There were complications.

12:58.734 --> 13:00.780
We tried everything.

13:14.010 --> 13:17.927
[water flowing]

13:31.158 --> 13:32.333
- Jaime?

13:37.425 --> 13:38.818
Jaime!

13:43.431 --> 13:45.215
Jaime!

13:45.389 --> 13:46.782
- Yeah!

13:54.485 --> 13:57.140
- Sorry,
I didn't know where you were.

13:59.969 --> 14:01.666
- I was gone for like a minute.

14:03.886 --> 14:06.715
I didn't mean to upset you.

14:06.889 --> 14:08.369
- JAIME: You didn't upset me.

14:08.543 --> 14:10.110
I'm not upset.

14:10.284 --> 14:11.198
I'm fine.

14:18.335 --> 14:19.859
I'm having a great time.

14:23.688 --> 14:24.559
What do you think?

14:24.733 --> 14:25.952
Ready to get moving?

14:41.793 --> 14:43.186
- You know,
you don't have to hide it.

14:44.579 --> 14:46.320
- What?

14:46.494 --> 14:47.495
- This morning.

14:49.801 --> 14:50.890
When you were gone.

14:52.717 --> 14:54.023
You were smoking.

14:56.025 --> 14:57.853
- I took like two quick drags.

14:58.027 --> 15:00.073
- I'd rather you not hide it.

15:00.247 --> 15:02.640
- Well, I--
I knew you'd be upset.

15:04.991 --> 15:06.514
- I want you to feel
you can be honest with me.

15:06.688 --> 15:07.950
- I don't want to
fight about it.

15:08.124 --> 15:09.604
- I don't either!
This is a discussion.

15:09.778 --> 15:11.214
- JAIME: Oh!

15:11.388 --> 15:13.129
Would you mind being just
a tiny bit more careful?

15:13.303 --> 15:14.435
Please.

15:22.747 --> 15:23.923
- Okay.

15:26.447 --> 15:28.014
- What?

15:28.188 --> 15:30.668
- I don't like being spoken
to as if I'm an idiot.

15:32.061 --> 15:33.497
- What?

15:33.671 --> 15:35.021
- Did I tip the boat?

15:37.371 --> 15:38.546
- Ah...

15:41.723 --> 15:43.333
- Is this how
this whole trip's gonna go?

15:44.944 --> 15:46.684
You go avoiding me
and being all pissy?

15:49.209 --> 15:50.297
What are we even
doing here then?

15:51.820 --> 15:53.082
If you aren't gonna try,
then what are we doing out

15:53.256 --> 15:54.257
here all sweaty, and gross,

15:54.431 --> 15:55.650
and surrounded by bugs.

15:55.824 --> 15:57.260
And aren't you always saying,

15:57.434 --> 15:58.392
how you want to get out
of the city and get away

15:58.566 --> 15:59.610
from how busy you are.

15:59.784 --> 16:01.177
- JAIME: Yes! Yes! Get away!

16:01.351 --> 16:03.092
Not be trapped for a week
with the last person I--

16:07.009 --> 16:08.445
- The last person that what?

16:15.409 --> 16:17.280
What, Jamie?

16:20.457 --> 16:22.285
- My whole life is
for someone else.

16:23.808 --> 16:25.071
We live in the city,
because that's

16:25.245 --> 16:27.464
where you are more comfortable.

16:27.638 --> 16:30.032
I stay at a fucking job I hate,

16:30.206 --> 16:32.730
that I am extremely
overqualified for,

16:32.904 --> 16:36.386
so there is a house,
and retirement account,

16:36.560 --> 16:39.128
and insurance--
- Where is this all coming from?

16:40.738 --> 16:42.566
You and I always talked
about everything.

16:42.740 --> 16:43.741
- Hey, you talk.

16:43.915 --> 16:45.743
You talk and I listen.

16:45.917 --> 16:47.789
And after Ally--

16:47.963 --> 16:49.008
- Don't you do that.

16:50.618 --> 16:51.749
Don't use her as an excuse.

16:51.923 --> 16:52.794
- You wanted kids.

16:52.968 --> 16:54.230
I wanted you, and now--

16:54.404 --> 16:56.537
- Fuck you, Jamie!

16:56.711 --> 16:58.887
You think that-that
doesn't affect me, too?

16:59.061 --> 17:03.022
Like, I'm not in agony
over the whole thing?

17:04.848 --> 17:07.416
I feel so,

17:09.506 --> 17:10.594
so sad.

17:12.204 --> 17:13.554
And angry.

17:16.252 --> 17:17.949
And guilty.

17:20.387 --> 17:22.563
But I can't even talk
to you about it,

17:22.737 --> 17:24.694
because you just shut down.

17:26.435 --> 17:28.395
[cries]

17:28.569 --> 17:29.613
- Look,

17:31.441 --> 17:32.790
I think we both know

17:32.964 --> 17:34.444
this is just postponing
the inevitable.

17:40.059 --> 17:41.234
No! Don't stand--

17:43.236 --> 17:47.240
[muffled shouting]

17:53.289 --> 17:54.464
[bone breaking]
[muffled scream]

17:54.638 --> 17:55.944
JAIME: Alex!

17:56.118 --> 17:58.773
- ALEX: Oh fuck!
- I got you!

17:58.947 --> 18:00.079
[screams]

18:00.253 --> 18:01.384
JAIME: Come on.

18:03.169 --> 18:07.042
[screaming]

18:11.786 --> 18:13.004
JAIME:
Shit! All of our stuff...

18:13.179 --> 18:17.531
[Alex sobs]

18:17.705 --> 18:19.359
You're gonna be okay.

18:19.533 --> 18:21.274
- Oh, my leg...

18:21.448 --> 18:22.536
Fuck...

18:22.710 --> 18:24.712
[grunting]

18:24.886 --> 18:26.366
- The town is just
a few miles away.

18:26.540 --> 18:28.542
You're gonna be okay.

18:28.716 --> 18:29.978
We will go slow.

18:51.347 --> 18:53.697
Hey, hey, Lex?

18:53.871 --> 18:55.177
- My leg...

19:21.247 --> 19:23.945
- Hey! Hey! Lex?

19:24.119 --> 19:25.555
I need you to stay awake, okay?

19:25.729 --> 19:27.122
- Can we stop?

19:29.298 --> 19:31.257
We're almost done, okay.

19:32.823 --> 19:34.695
We're close,
just a bit farther.

19:38.742 --> 19:39.787
Hey, a car!

19:39.961 --> 19:41.702
Hey! Hey Lex, look!

19:41.876 --> 19:43.051
Look!

19:45.445 --> 19:47.664
[whistle blowing]

19:57.935 --> 19:59.633
Oh, thank God, a person.

19:59.807 --> 20:01.200
Hey!

20:01.374 --> 20:02.244
Hello!

20:02.418 --> 20:04.246
Hey! Hey!

20:04.420 --> 20:05.856
Hello?

20:06.030 --> 20:08.207
Hey, we need a little he--

20:08.381 --> 20:09.643
We need a little--

20:09.817 --> 20:11.819
Oh, Lex.

20:11.993 --> 20:14.430
Lex, hey!
Hey, we're almost done.

20:14.604 --> 20:16.867
Okay. Help is almost here.

20:17.041 --> 20:18.173
Just stay with me.

20:31.230 --> 20:31.882
[gun shot]

20:32.056 --> 20:33.144
Oh!

20:34.798 --> 20:36.670
Holy shit! He just--

20:41.109 --> 20:43.111
Oh, no! No!

20:47.158 --> 20:48.769
[tense music]

20:52.599 --> 20:54.470
Hey!

20:54.644 --> 20:56.037
Hey, is anybody there?

20:57.256 --> 20:58.779
Hey! Hey!

20:58.953 --> 21:00.259
Hey, please!

21:04.045 --> 21:06.308
[gasps]

21:06.482 --> 21:07.570
- TATER:
Move away from the Hep!

21:07.744 --> 21:09.093
- Wait, what?
- Step aside.

21:09.268 --> 21:11.008
I can see she got the bug.

21:11.182 --> 21:12.662
- We were just trying to
get to the hospital.

21:12.836 --> 21:14.664
- Step aside.

21:14.838 --> 21:16.231
- No, please! He is insane.

21:16.405 --> 21:18.494
He just shot a man over there.

21:18.668 --> 21:20.279
- Tater?
- This one won't move aside,

21:20.453 --> 21:22.890
otherwise I'd have that Hep
down already, Big John.

21:23.064 --> 21:25.240
- I-- I don't even know
what he's talking about.

21:25.414 --> 21:26.850
Please!

21:27.024 --> 21:28.939
- You're just gonna
shoot us for no reason?

21:31.899 --> 21:32.813
- It spoke.

21:32.987 --> 21:35.250
[panting]

21:35.424 --> 21:36.512
What happened to you all?

21:36.686 --> 21:38.122
- She hurt her leg.

21:38.297 --> 21:39.776
We're just trying to get
to town for a hospital

21:39.950 --> 21:42.039
when this psycho
started shooting at us.

21:42.213 --> 21:43.650
- I-- I thought
she was one of 'em.

21:43.824 --> 21:45.695
- He just killed someone
right over there!

21:45.869 --> 21:47.523
We saw him.
- Jamie?

21:49.046 --> 21:50.309
Jamie Miller?

21:52.833 --> 21:55.052
It's Bernie.
We went to Junior High together.

21:56.663 --> 21:58.273
That's Jamie Miller,
Robert's daughter.

22:00.928 --> 22:01.755
- You know my dad?

22:01.929 --> 22:03.278
- Well, yeah, of course!

22:03.452 --> 22:04.540
Hell, our home base
is in his warehouse.

22:04.714 --> 22:06.325
But he went out to--
- Bernie!

22:06.499 --> 22:08.196
Get back in there and
get this thing ready to roll.

22:08.370 --> 22:10.111
- Yeah, yeah.

22:10.285 --> 22:12.069
- What happened to her?

22:12.243 --> 22:14.289
- Broke my leg.

22:14.463 --> 22:16.639
- Seems we have a bit of
a misunderstanding here.

22:16.813 --> 22:18.380
- We need to get
to the hospital.

22:18.554 --> 22:19.599
- Hospital's no good.

22:19.773 --> 22:20.774
It's been overrun.

22:21.992 --> 22:23.167
- Overrun?

22:24.430 --> 22:26.040
- Where y'all been?

22:26.214 --> 22:28.347
- We-- We've been out camping.

22:29.913 --> 22:31.393
What the hell is going on?

22:31.567 --> 22:33.221
- This outbreak
or whatever it is.

22:33.395 --> 22:35.266
Hit us fast and hard.

22:35.441 --> 22:38.139
- They were saying
they had it under control.

22:38.313 --> 22:40.184
- Seems there's what they say
up there, and then,

22:40.359 --> 22:41.925
there's what we see
here on the ground.

22:43.536 --> 22:45.146
- DIANE: Gruber? Sterling's boys
just turned off the

22:45.320 --> 22:47.061
main road up here,
they're heading your way.

22:47.235 --> 22:48.584
- Copy that, Diane.

22:48.758 --> 22:49.759
Bernie, how long?

22:49.933 --> 22:51.326
We gotta get this off the road.

22:51.500 --> 22:52.893
- BERNIE: She's ready.

22:53.067 --> 22:54.764
- Tater, you get this RV
back to the warehouse.

22:54.938 --> 22:55.809
- You got it, Big John.

22:55.983 --> 22:57.419
Bernie!

22:57.593 --> 22:58.725
- BERNIE: Yeah.
- In the back of the truck.

22:58.899 --> 22:59.726
Make sure nothing
bothers these two.

22:59.900 --> 23:00.770
- Yes.

23:02.076 --> 23:03.077
- GRUBER:
Get her over to Louie's.

23:03.251 --> 23:04.644
It's a vet clinic.

23:04.818 --> 23:06.167
Fix up her leg.

23:08.604 --> 23:10.214
You can trust me.

23:15.002 --> 23:17.308
- Again, we ask everyone,
please stay indoors

23:17.483 --> 23:19.310
and wait further instructions
from the authorities.

23:19.485 --> 23:21.487
Now, I have some data

23:21.661 --> 23:25.316
for you which is uh, good news.
- [dog howling &amp; barking]

23:25.491 --> 23:28.450
- What we're seeing in my office
from the more populated areas,

23:28.624 --> 23:29.669
those are the areas

23:29.843 --> 23:31.540
with a population of uh,

23:31.714 --> 23:33.673
- Oh, son of a bitch!

23:33.847 --> 23:35.544
- TIRED GOVERNOR:
50,000 or more. 50,000.

23:35.718 --> 23:37.938
Uh, we're seeing less infections
per day than two days ago.

23:38.112 --> 23:39.287
- GRUBER: Louie!

23:39.461 --> 23:41.115
- Alright, alright.

23:41.289 --> 23:42.682
- GRUBER: Open up!
- TIRED GOVERNOR: That's good.

23:42.856 --> 23:44.466
That's an improvement.
What we need

23:44.640 --> 23:45.859
from the rest of the state...
- Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!

23:46.033 --> 23:46.642
Don't bring her in here
if she's got it.

23:46.816 --> 23:47.643
- She doesn't.

23:47.817 --> 23:48.775
It's just a broken leg.

23:48.949 --> 23:50.733
- You have to help us. Please.

23:50.907 --> 23:52.300
- GOVERNOR: Our city has mo--
more populated places.

23:53.823 --> 23:54.955
As my father used to say
and I agree with this

23:55.129 --> 23:56.696
- Bring her back.

23:56.870 --> 23:58.872
- GOVERNOR: from my TV show
in the 1950s.

23:59.046 --> 24:01.570
Just the facts, man,
just-- just the facts.

24:03.006 --> 24:04.573
- Alright.
Put her down right here.

24:04.747 --> 24:06.749
You can wheel that cart over
to put her legs on it.

24:06.923 --> 24:08.272
- GRUBER: You're doing
the right thing here.

24:08.447 --> 24:10.187
- I'm not gonna be
your personal physician.

24:10.361 --> 24:11.928
- We need you, Louie.

24:12.102 --> 24:13.103
- Don't start with me again.
We talked about it.

24:13.277 --> 24:14.540
- This is a critical situation.

24:14.714 --> 24:15.932
How things are out there.

24:16.106 --> 24:17.020
Difference between
life and death,

24:17.194 --> 24:18.761
is a game of inches.

24:18.935 --> 24:20.241
- Don't give me your game
of inches bullshit, alright.

24:20.415 --> 24:21.938
It won't gonna work on me,
alright.

24:22.112 --> 24:23.374
I'm not gonna join up
with you and your buddies.

24:23.549 --> 24:25.507
- You have an obligation
to this community.

24:25.681 --> 24:28.075
- I have an obligation
to not take a side

24:28.249 --> 24:29.468
in this pissing contest.

24:30.686 --> 24:32.514
- Oh, damn.

24:32.688 --> 24:34.124
- What's your name?
- Jamie.

24:34.298 --> 24:35.212
- Alright, want you to
take this towel, Jamie.

24:35.386 --> 24:37.127
I want you to press down.

24:37.301 --> 24:39.739
- I have already explained you
it's not safe for you out there.

24:39.913 --> 24:41.828
You're too valuable
to leave in harm's way.

24:42.002 --> 24:43.525
- LOUIE: I'm not gonna be
ammunition for your little--

24:43.699 --> 24:44.700
- How hard do I press?

24:44.874 --> 24:46.093
- Very firmly.

24:46.267 --> 24:47.268
- What do you think
happens to you

24:47.442 --> 24:48.182
if Sterling gets a hold of you?

24:48.356 --> 24:49.618
[Alex gasps]

24:49.792 --> 24:50.837
- She's awake.
- I am following the

24:51.011 --> 24:52.621
- Governor's orders.
- Jamie?

24:52.795 --> 24:54.318
- The Governor's got bigger
problems in the cities.

24:55.972 --> 24:57.147
- Is this a hospital?

24:57.321 --> 24:58.758
- It's a vet's office.
It's okay.

24:58.932 --> 25:00.629
You're gonna be okay.

25:00.803 --> 25:03.893
- Louie,
people are dying out there.

25:04.067 --> 25:06.113
If we don't take action,
more will die.

25:10.073 --> 25:11.379
- What did you give her?

25:11.553 --> 25:13.294
- Just something
to help her sleep.

25:13.468 --> 25:14.600
Alright, will you guys
get the hell out of here now!

25:14.774 --> 25:16.036
So, I can focus.

25:23.173 --> 25:24.218
- Is she gonna be okay?

25:24.392 --> 25:25.306
- Ah, I don't know.

25:25.480 --> 25:27.264
I mean, uh, yeah.

25:27.438 --> 25:29.310
I mean, that's a bad break,
but she'll be okay.

25:30.659 --> 25:32.400
- What the hell is going on?

25:32.574 --> 25:34.663
- Well, this virus
or whatever the hell it is,

25:34.837 --> 25:37.013
it's just tearing through here.

25:37.187 --> 25:38.798
- But how did it
get this fucking crazy?

25:38.972 --> 25:40.669
- Well, my guess is,

25:40.843 --> 25:43.542
they were lying about
how quickly it was spreading.

25:43.716 --> 25:44.934
Look, Jamie,

25:46.240 --> 25:48.285
whoever you know, you call 'em.

25:48.459 --> 25:50.505
Say whatever you say,
do whatever you got to do.

25:50.679 --> 25:52.463
But don't get sucked into

25:52.638 --> 25:54.291
whatever those assholes
are cooking up.

25:57.468 --> 25:58.339
Get the door.

25:59.470 --> 26:00.820
- Yeah.

26:05.651 --> 26:06.739
- Looks like this is it.

26:06.913 --> 26:08.044
Go to that medicine cabinet.

26:08.218 --> 26:09.742
Get everything in there,
home meds.

26:09.916 --> 26:11.004
I'll meet you out back
in the truck.

26:11.178 --> 26:12.048
- Yes, sir.
Got a big journey.

26:12.222 --> 26:13.397
Hurry.
- Yes, sir.

26:15.312 --> 26:19.229
[dogs barking]

26:29.718 --> 26:30.937
- JAMIE: How is she?

26:31.111 --> 26:33.026
- Well, she's all set
and sown up.

26:33.200 --> 26:34.201
She should be ready in--

26:35.463 --> 26:37.160
That son-of-a-bitch!

26:37.334 --> 26:38.814
I told him no!

26:40.555 --> 26:41.948
John! You got no right.

26:42.122 --> 26:43.079
I want you to unload it all
right now!

26:43.253 --> 26:44.603
- GRUBER: I know you're upset,

26:44.777 --> 26:46.213
but this is what's needed
for the community.

26:46.387 --> 26:47.388
- LOUIE:
I don't give a shit, John,

26:47.562 --> 26:48.824
I want you to put it back!

26:48.998 --> 26:51.131
- GRUBER:
Calm down! This stuff ain't--

26:51.305 --> 26:52.480
- TIRED GOVERNOR:
If you cannot isolate yourself
from that person,

26:52.654 --> 26:54.134
it is best to uh,

26:54.308 --> 26:56.963
stay calm, do not antagonize,

26:57.137 --> 26:58.834
or provoke them in any way.

26:59.008 --> 27:00.401
It's very important.
I wanna-- I wanna emphasize

27:00.575 --> 27:02.055
they have been proven
to be docile,

27:02.229 --> 27:03.752
when not threatened.

27:03.926 --> 27:06.015
They're people
who are only seeking help.

27:06.189 --> 27:09.018
Do not antagonize
these individuals.

27:09.192 --> 27:11.717
It is been under a tremendous
amount of medical and physical--

27:11.891 --> 27:13.632
- That's bullshit!

27:13.806 --> 27:15.634
Oh, no! No! No!

27:15.808 --> 27:16.983
Fuck you!

27:17.157 --> 27:18.114
You are...

27:19.812 --> 27:20.682
Aah!

27:22.118 --> 27:24.860
I said you are nuts!

27:26.732 --> 27:28.516
- TIRED GOVERNOR: So again,
look at these charts.

27:28.690 --> 27:30.474
As you can see,
the numbers don't lie.

27:30.649 --> 27:31.998
We're dealing with facts.
We're dealing with numbers.

27:32.172 --> 27:33.521
We're dealing with science.

27:33.695 --> 27:35.175
So, it is imperative
that you uh,

27:35.349 --> 27:37.046
follow the steps
we are advising you.

27:37.220 --> 27:39.658
Ah, ordering you to
follow for lack of a--

27:39.832 --> 27:41.660
of a better word.
Now uh, my offices

27:41.834 --> 27:44.010
working again with
the National Guard as I said,

27:44.184 --> 27:45.881
from the state level all the way
down to the local level.

27:46.055 --> 27:47.753
So, if we have deployed
the National Guard

27:47.927 --> 27:49.842
in the state.

27:50.016 --> 27:51.321
They are there to help you.
They are there to protect you.

27:51.495 --> 27:53.367
They are there
to save your life.

27:53.541 --> 27:55.108
If you encounter
any National Guard,

27:55.282 --> 27:59.242
it is imperative that you uh,
do as they say.

27:59.416 --> 28:01.288
Listen to their uh,
to their orders, demands,

28:01.462 --> 28:02.463
their instructions.

28:02.637 --> 28:06.989
[indistinct speech]

28:07.163 --> 28:10.993
[telephone beeps]

28:11.167 --> 28:15.041
[dials numbers]

28:15.215 --> 28:18.261
We're all fighting for
the same thing, your safety.

[rasping]

28:45.158 --> 28:47.247
[taking deep breaths]

28:55.298 --> 28:56.082
- VET OFFICE HEP: Help.

28:56.256 --> 28:57.736
Help?

29:01.957 --> 29:05.221
[grunting]

29:15.101 --> 29:17.277
- Hi,
you've reached Robert Miller.

29:17.451 --> 29:20.671
I'm most likely
at the shop working.

29:20.846 --> 29:23.849
[hep rasping]

29:24.023 --> 29:27.940
You can leave me a message here,
but I don't always check those.

29:28.114 --> 29:30.594
You can try my cell phone.

29:30.769 --> 29:31.682
And that's...

29:34.207 --> 29:36.644
455-8932.

29:36.818 --> 29:40.430
[indistinct speech]

29:45.740 --> 29:47.220
...If you really want--

29:47.394 --> 29:49.788
If you need me,
come on down to the shop.

29:49.962 --> 29:52.181
Door's open.

29:52.355 --> 29:53.661
Bless you and yours...

29:58.100 --> 29:59.275
- Help.

29:59.449 --> 30:01.538
Help.

30:05.368 --> 30:06.456
- Alex! We have to go!

30:06.630 --> 30:07.544
[Alex groans]

30:07.718 --> 30:08.719
Come on, come on, wake up!

30:11.722 --> 30:15.944
[taking deep breaths]

30:29.131 --> 30:33.266
[panting]

30:33.440 --> 30:37.009
[grunting]

30:42.753 --> 30:46.627
[screams]

30:57.159 --> 30:59.074
- I don't give two shits!
I want you to put it back!!

30:59.248 --> 31:00.554
- I know you're upset,
but this is what's--

31:00.728 --> 31:01.947
- I'm not gonna be steamrolled--

31:02.121 --> 31:03.731
- There's one's of them!
Right behind me.

31:03.905 --> 31:05.472
- Move! Move!

31:05.646 --> 31:06.429
Down!

31:06.603 --> 31:10.564
[rasping]

31:15.438 --> 31:17.049
Stay quiet.

31:17.223 --> 31:19.138
They'll move on,
if we stay still.

31:19.312 --> 31:23.359
[rasping]

31:36.329 --> 31:39.941
[taking deep breaths]

31:44.511 --> 31:45.729
- Gross, ain't it?

31:47.644 --> 31:49.516
That's one of the ways
you can tell they have it.

31:50.778 --> 31:52.301
Gives 'em a terrible headache.

31:53.607 --> 31:55.914
Right there.

31:56.088 --> 31:58.177
[heps rasping]

31:58.351 --> 31:59.395
- GRUBER: Hey!

32:02.224 --> 32:03.965
Let's get the truck.
Louie, get in the cab.

32:04.139 --> 32:05.662
- No!

32:05.836 --> 32:07.708
- Louie, get in the dig. Get up.
- I can't! Let go of me!

32:10.450 --> 32:13.932
[grunting]

32:18.414 --> 32:19.546
- Go get yourself,
you stubborn-- Just get--

32:19.720 --> 32:21.156
- Let go of me!

32:21.330 --> 32:25.030
[rasping]

32:27.075 --> 32:28.685
- Take both of 'em.

32:28.859 --> 32:30.252
Let's get her in the back.

32:41.698 --> 32:42.961
No, Bernie!

32:43.135 --> 32:47.052
[screaming]

32:48.618 --> 32:52.405
[grunting]

32:59.064 --> 33:02.676
[rasping]

33:07.115 --> 33:07.898
[grunts]

33:08.073 --> 33:10.727
[pants]

33:14.731 --> 33:15.950
- You okay?

33:16.124 --> 33:16.995
- Yeah.

33:17.169 --> 33:20.476
[panting]

33:21.825 --> 33:22.870
- Jamie...

33:23.044 --> 33:24.524
- Oh my God.

33:26.787 --> 33:28.049
- Didn't I tell you

33:28.223 --> 33:29.007
to not bring
the damn bullet action?

33:32.140 --> 33:33.620
This isn't hunting out here.

33:33.794 --> 33:35.274
You need an appropriate weapon.

33:37.058 --> 33:38.842
Will you listen to me
next time, son?

33:39.017 --> 33:40.018
- Yes, sir.

33:51.464 --> 33:52.421
- Jamie.

33:57.426 --> 33:58.427
Did he get you?

33:58.601 --> 33:59.950
- Oh! Son of a bitch!

34:00.125 --> 34:01.952
What do you think? God damn!

34:02.127 --> 34:03.041
- Hey, watch your mouth there.

34:03.215 --> 34:04.607
- Oh shit.

34:04.781 --> 34:05.695
- You guys just get
the hell away from me.

34:05.869 --> 34:07.175
- Louie, hey! Think.

34:07.349 --> 34:09.569
If they scratched you,
you go--

34:09.743 --> 34:11.397
BERNIE:
Come out here, Louie.

34:11.571 --> 34:12.920
- LOUIE: Just get the hell
out of here, all of you!

34:13.094 --> 34:14.268
- BERNIE: You've been scratched.
We all saw it.

34:14.443 --> 34:15.879
We know you're gonna turn
into one of 'em.

34:16.054 --> 34:18.099
You come out here,
be a man about it.

34:20.841 --> 34:22.495
- LOUIE: You already got
what you came for.

34:22.668 --> 34:24.453
So, just leave me alone already.

34:24.627 --> 34:26.847
- Either you open this door
or I will break it down, Louie.

34:28.239 --> 34:30.458
- Bernie?
- I will break this door down!

34:30.632 --> 34:31.982
- Sterling.

34:32.157 --> 34:33.375
Leave him!

34:35.507 --> 34:39.599
[engine starts]

34:39.773 --> 34:40.991
- Aah.

34:48.347 --> 34:49.130
[tires screeches]

34:49.304 --> 34:50.349
- What the fuck?

35:08.715 --> 35:09.629
- Might as well move on.

35:09.803 --> 35:11.326
They already cleared me out.

35:21.989 --> 35:24.905
Tell your friends to get their
hands off me please!

35:25.079 --> 35:27.647
Aah! What the fuck do I have
to do to get everybody

35:27.821 --> 35:29.344
to just leave me
the hell alone, huh?

35:29.518 --> 35:31.564
I don't have
anything left to take.

35:31.738 --> 35:33.000
Gruber took it all.

35:34.610 --> 35:35.437
- Yeah.

35:36.917 --> 35:38.875
Looks like we're a little late
to the party.

35:40.703 --> 35:42.444
A hep do that?

35:42.618 --> 35:44.229
- Oh, you must have been top
of your class at the academy!

35:44.403 --> 35:46.535
No actually,
a horse did this.

35:46.709 --> 35:48.537
See I had a big fruit basket
on my head

35:48.711 --> 35:50.278
and he thought it was
a fucking apple.

35:50.452 --> 35:52.062
Of course,
it was a fuckin' hep.

35:52.237 --> 35:54.674
Who else attacks people
except you fucking rednecks.

35:54.848 --> 35:57.329
At least, the heps
don't steal my shit!

35:57.503 --> 35:59.461
I am so sick
and tired of you guys

35:59.635 --> 36:02.203
just doing whatever you want,
as if there's no consequences

36:02.377 --> 36:03.726
what so all you--

36:03.900 --> 36:05.815
you bust into my office,
you push me around,

36:05.989 --> 36:07.948
you treat me like
a sack of shit.

36:17.087 --> 36:23.442
[dramatic music]

36:23.616 --> 36:25.270
- STERLING: I feel sorta bad
for those hillbillies,

36:25.444 --> 36:28.186
just blindly following Gruber.

36:28.360 --> 36:30.623
That grunt doesn't know his ass
from a hole in the ground.

36:30.797 --> 36:32.190
[men chuckling]

37:02.829 --> 37:04.831
[horn honking]

37:21.500 --> 37:22.718
- Alright, ladies.

37:22.892 --> 37:24.154
Let's see you all inside.

37:27.462 --> 37:28.420
- You okay?

37:29.986 --> 37:31.727
- I never thought
I'd see this place again.

37:35.296 --> 37:37.298
- Don't worry.

37:37.472 --> 37:39.996
Everyone here wants
the same thing you do,

37:40.170 --> 37:41.563
a safe place to sleep.

37:43.086 --> 37:44.784
Hey, Diane!

37:44.958 --> 37:46.133
Why don't you go fetch
that wheelchair

37:46.307 --> 37:48.266
and help these two inside?

37:48.440 --> 37:49.963
And show 'em to
a room over by you.

37:52.922 --> 37:56.404
Listen, once you get settled,
why don't you come find me?

37:56.578 --> 37:59.494
We need to have a...
little chat.

38:02.889 --> 38:04.586
- DIANE: Sorry, it's not such
a warm welcome.

38:04.760 --> 38:07.415
Most everyone is out
getting things or

38:07.589 --> 38:10.679
trying to gather up folks
who haven't got the bug yet.

38:10.853 --> 38:14.814
Uh, well, uh down there,
there's supplies,

38:14.988 --> 38:17.425
and storage,
and-- and things, and...

38:17.599 --> 38:18.948
and past that,
that's the end bay,

38:19.122 --> 38:22.038
where most everyone else
has their room set up.

38:25.520 --> 38:26.739
Y'all roomies?

38:26.913 --> 38:28.523
- Yeah.

38:28.697 --> 38:30.264
Ever since college.

38:30.438 --> 38:32.614
- My sister had five roommates.

38:32.788 --> 38:34.529
[Diane chuckles]
With the ROTC,

38:34.703 --> 38:35.922
I used to tell her all the time,
I don't know

38:36.096 --> 38:37.184
how she lived
with that many people.

38:38.707 --> 38:40.143
Imagine what she would think

38:40.318 --> 38:42.624
seeing me living with
all of these folks now

38:42.798 --> 38:44.104
if she was still alive.

38:48.195 --> 38:50.458
I just want you to know
I am super grateful

38:50.632 --> 38:52.591
your dad was so prepared

38:52.765 --> 38:55.245
and has let me here
with the others.

38:55.420 --> 38:58.553
And I can't ever repay him
enough for it.

39:04.907 --> 39:06.735
- Um, ok-- okay.

39:09.956 --> 39:11.479
- Of course,
this is the common area.

39:12.872 --> 39:14.787
We've been having family meals.

39:17.137 --> 39:18.791
DIANE:
It's a God send, I think.

39:18.965 --> 39:22.621
A couple times day
where we can feel almost normal.

39:23.883 --> 39:25.014
- Bitch...

39:26.886 --> 39:28.191
Ah.

39:29.628 --> 39:31.369
What the fuck you looking at?

39:32.935 --> 39:33.980
- DIANE: You okay?

39:34.154 --> 39:35.373
- Oh yeah.
- Did I say something to

39:35.547 --> 39:37.418
upset you?
- No, no. You're--

39:37.592 --> 39:38.811
you're fine.

39:38.985 --> 39:40.290
I-- I um...

39:41.770 --> 39:42.815
I'm fine.

39:44.991 --> 39:46.253
Big John and the boys
put us all together

39:46.427 --> 39:48.037
a couple of days ago.

39:48.211 --> 39:50.910
It's rustic, but comfy.

39:51.084 --> 39:52.085
Here we are.

39:52.259 --> 39:54.043
Home sweet home.

39:54.217 --> 39:55.044
This will be your room.

39:55.218 --> 39:56.481
Uh, mine is just

39:56.655 --> 39:57.569
next door here.
- Yeah.

39:58.744 --> 40:00.746
[Alex coughs]

40:02.443 --> 40:04.924
- We're pretty lucky though.
Over here,

40:05.098 --> 40:07.187
there's a little more room
for those of us that,

40:07.361 --> 40:08.928
need a little more privacy.

40:13.280 --> 40:14.847
- Who is this
handsome young man?

40:15.021 --> 40:16.152
- Andrew, yeah.

40:16.326 --> 40:18.285
Can you say hi to Miss Alex?

40:20.766 --> 40:22.420
Andrew, come back here!
- It's okay.

40:23.638 --> 40:24.857
Maybe later.

40:25.031 --> 40:27.381
- He's just so timid.

40:28.774 --> 40:30.297
- I think that's normal
for his age.

40:31.864 --> 40:33.735
- I'll let you all get settled.

40:33.909 --> 40:35.128
Get you a fresh shirt.

40:35.302 --> 40:36.477
- Thank you.

40:40.568 --> 40:42.004
[sighs]

40:44.703 --> 40:45.878
Roommates?

40:47.880 --> 40:49.447
- We are not safe here.

40:49.621 --> 40:50.578
- I'm not going to lie
about being--

40:50.752 --> 40:52.319
- Alex, listen to me.

40:52.493 --> 40:54.190
You don't understand
these people.

40:54.364 --> 40:55.975
- You mean the people
who saved us?

40:58.281 --> 40:59.848
- I'm just saying,

41:00.022 --> 41:01.981
don't go assuming you trust
every smile you see.

41:02.155 --> 41:04.331
- I'm just saying why do you
have to always assume

41:04.505 --> 41:06.246
that people won't do
the right thing?

41:11.077 --> 41:12.034
- Experience.

41:12.208 --> 41:19.651
[ominous music]

41:23.916 --> 41:25.091
- Do you think he's here?

41:27.397 --> 41:28.877
- I'm gonna go find him.

41:29.051 --> 41:30.836
- I'll come with you.
- No. You stay here.

41:31.010 --> 41:32.446
I don't want you to
have to go by yourself.

41:32.620 --> 41:35.275
- He is my father,
and I will take care of it.

41:38.365 --> 41:42.064
I'm-- I'm just gonna
get cleaned up and

41:44.545 --> 41:45.415
you just rest.

41:49.071 --> 41:50.638
- Be happy you know
you got your wish.

41:52.161 --> 41:54.512
I completely regret
ever taking this trip.

42:22.365 --> 42:23.889
- Jamie, hi!

42:24.063 --> 42:25.673
It's funny,
I was just coming to find you.

42:27.370 --> 42:28.676
- I want...

42:32.288 --> 42:33.333
Is my dad in there?

42:35.465 --> 42:36.554
[sighs]

42:38.033 --> 42:39.339
- I need you to brace yourself.

42:44.083 --> 42:45.911
He was in a bad way
when I found him.

42:47.913 --> 42:49.479
He's in quite a bit of pain.

42:51.743 --> 42:53.396
Keeled over in the work bay.

42:56.312 --> 42:58.750
I locked him in here

42:58.924 --> 43:01.013
and did everything
I could think of.

43:02.667 --> 43:04.277
But he...

43:04.451 --> 43:05.800
He just kept getting worse.

43:08.194 --> 43:12.328
In the end, he had the strength
to do what I didn't.

43:15.854 --> 43:18.596
He had a gun room in here
I didn't know about.

43:21.729 --> 43:23.078
ROBERT: [shouting]

43:23.252 --> 43:24.253
GRUBER:
Found him yesterday morning.

43:25.733 --> 43:27.430
ROBERT:
[indistinct speech]

43:32.827 --> 43:34.089
- Bullshit!

43:34.263 --> 43:37.919
You're doing this shit
in my house!

43:38.093 --> 43:40.487
Who the fuck--
the fuck do you think you are?

43:48.364 --> 43:49.583
- We all owe him everything.

43:51.019 --> 43:52.368
If it wasn't for him
raising the alarm

43:52.542 --> 43:53.718
and getting us moving,

43:55.589 --> 43:57.635
I don't think most of us
would still be here now.

44:11.387 --> 44:12.345
Your father,

44:14.608 --> 44:17.655
he was kind of my only friend
when I was in really dark place.

44:20.179 --> 44:23.399
Told me a little bit
about your uh, condition.

44:25.663 --> 44:29.188
And how he reacted when you
shared that news with him.

44:32.452 --> 44:33.540
I want you to know
I told him that

44:33.714 --> 44:35.281
he was wrong to do that,

44:37.109 --> 44:39.067
and he should be supporting you
no matter what.

44:47.293 --> 44:48.511
- I bet he took that well.

44:50.122 --> 44:51.863
- He didn't talk to me much
after that.

44:54.387 --> 44:56.998
I don't claim to be an expert
in these things, but

44:57.172 --> 44:58.826
I know we should all be
sticking together.

45:00.219 --> 45:01.699
Especially in the tough times.

45:03.439 --> 45:04.789
It's a hard lesson,
but if you're lucky

45:04.963 --> 45:06.355
you only have to learn it once.

45:08.096 --> 45:10.664
Never miss the chance
to tell someone you love 'em.

45:14.842 --> 45:16.714
- BERNIE: Hey Big John, Bernie--

45:19.455 --> 45:20.630
- Give you some time.

45:22.241 --> 45:23.764
Be right outside if you need me.

45:37.038 --> 45:41.303
- I spent years
imagining what I would say

45:41.477 --> 45:42.827
if I ever saw you again.

45:45.307 --> 45:49.616

01:15:31.048 --> 01:15:32.136
Hey!

01:15:33.224 --> 01:15:34.617
Hello?

01:15:34.791 --> 01:15:36.053
Is anybody there?

01:15:37.358 --> 01:15:38.708
Hello?

01:15:41.580 --> 01:15:44.975
[tire screeches]

01:15:56.160 --> 01:15:57.291
- BERNIE: Alright, ladies!

01:15:57.465 --> 01:15:58.728
Step away from the RV!

01:16:00.207 --> 01:16:04.298
[grunting]

01:16:04.472 --> 01:16:05.386
- Jamie...

01:16:06.562 --> 01:16:07.301
[coughing]

01:16:07.475 --> 01:16:08.172
- She sick?

01:16:08.346 --> 01:16:09.521
- No!

01:16:09.695 --> 01:16:11.392
Lex, get back in the RV, okay?

01:16:11.567 --> 01:16:14.004
- [spits] Son-of-a-bitch.
She's sick alright.

01:16:14.178 --> 01:16:16.049
- She is fine!

01:16:16.223 --> 01:16:18.182
We are leaving.
- Everybody, stop!

01:16:20.271 --> 01:16:21.533
- Stay back!

01:16:23.448 --> 01:16:24.971
- Put the gun down, Jamie.

01:16:25.145 --> 01:16:26.146
- Stop!

01:16:26.320 --> 01:16:27.147
Stay where you are!

01:16:28.366 --> 01:16:29.367
- Put those down.

01:16:29.541 --> 01:16:30.760
- Just leave us alone!

01:16:30.934 --> 01:16:31.848
- Okay.

01:16:32.022 --> 01:16:32.979
It's okay.

01:16:34.198 --> 01:16:35.765
- She got the bug.

01:16:35.939 --> 01:16:38.376
- Tater,
I said lower your weapon.

01:16:46.819 --> 01:16:48.168
It's okay.

01:16:49.822 --> 01:16:50.649
Now we can talk.

01:16:50.823 --> 01:16:52.129
- I don't wanna talk.

01:16:52.303 --> 01:16:53.609
I want to leave!

01:16:53.783 --> 01:16:56.829
- I understand.
But we need that RV.

01:16:57.003 --> 01:16:59.876
It's important to keep
all those families we have safe.

01:17:00.050 --> 01:17:01.007
Think about them, Jamie.

01:17:01.181 --> 01:17:05.011
[retches]

01:17:07.579 --> 01:17:11.017
- I won't let you hurt her.

01:17:11.191 --> 01:17:13.150
- I want to help.
- I saw how you help.

01:17:14.542 --> 01:17:16.370
We're leaving.

01:17:16.544 --> 01:17:17.589
- I'll tell you what.

01:17:19.286 --> 01:17:20.418
I'll drive you there.

01:17:22.202 --> 01:17:23.551
I'll take you
wherever you want to go.

01:17:23.726 --> 01:17:25.945
- You can't do that, Big John!

01:17:26.119 --> 01:17:27.294
That one's got the bug!

01:17:27.468 --> 01:17:29.819
- Tater!
I said put that weapon down!

01:17:29.993 --> 01:17:31.908
- No, you said we had a mission!

01:17:32.082 --> 01:17:33.300
- I said lower your weapon!

01:17:33.474 --> 01:17:34.650
- He's right, Big John.

01:17:34.824 --> 01:17:35.694
We can't let her
infect anyone else!

01:17:35.868 --> 01:17:37.130
- I'm in charge!

01:17:37.304 --> 01:17:38.392
I'm in command!

01:17:39.872 --> 01:17:41.961
Now lower your weapons.

01:17:49.490 --> 01:17:51.884
Jamie, do we have a deal?

01:17:53.277 --> 01:17:54.365
No! No!

01:17:54.539 --> 01:17:55.845
Listen to me!

01:17:56.019 --> 01:17:56.933
- We cannot
just let them get away!

01:17:58.761 --> 01:18:00.588
[tense music]

01:18:04.244 --> 01:18:06.072

[panting]

01:18:35.014 --> 01:18:37.495
- Jaime, get behind me.

01:18:37.669 --> 01:18:39.540
- You all tried to kill us!

01:18:39.715 --> 01:18:42.239
- Please, Jamie.
- Please, sir.

01:18:42.413 --> 01:18:44.589
Sir... Sterling?

01:18:44.763 --> 01:18:45.721
Is it?

01:18:47.157 --> 01:18:48.506
We just want to go home, please.

01:18:50.116 --> 01:18:51.770
Please, just let us go home!

01:18:58.342 --> 01:18:59.430
Please!

01:19:01.519 --> 01:19:03.303
Please, just let us go home!

01:19:12.312 --> 01:19:13.574
- Jamie...

01:19:15.663 --> 01:19:17.274
[indistinct shouting]

01:19:17.448 --> 01:19:21.147

01:19:37.294 --> 01:19:38.599
[chuckles]

01:19:38.774 --> 01:19:41.298
- So, I...

01:19:43.256 --> 01:19:46.956
I just wanna say...

01:19:51.874 --> 01:19:53.310
it would be you.

01:20:06.845 --> 01:20:07.803
[indistinct shouting]

01:20:07.977 --> 01:20:12.198
[shots fire]

01:20:14.026 --> 01:20:15.767
- Jaime!
- No! Let me go!

01:20:15.941 --> 01:20:17.334
I have to get her!

01:20:17.508 --> 01:20:19.815
Alex, Alex.

01:20:19.989 --> 01:20:22.643

[somber music]

01:20:40.748 --> 01:20:42.794
- Can you carry her?

01:20:42.968 --> 01:20:44.796
- What?
- Can you carry her?

01:20:46.058 --> 01:20:47.755
- Yes.

01:20:47.930 --> 01:20:49.496
- Come this way

01:20:49.670 --> 01:20:51.237
and get the hell out of here!

01:20:53.196 --> 01:20:56.982
[shots fire]

01:21:12.215 --> 01:21:14.304
[Alex coughs]

01:21:20.571 --> 01:21:21.659
- Lex?

01:21:26.403 --> 01:21:28.057
Hold on.

01:21:28.231 --> 01:21:29.972
Hold on just a little longer.

01:21:30.146 --> 01:21:31.321
I'll-- I'll--

01:21:31.495 --> 01:21:33.236
I'll get help.

01:21:33.410 --> 01:21:34.585
- I'm...

01:21:34.759 --> 01:21:37.022
[breaths heavily]

01:21:37.196 --> 01:21:38.241
sorry.

01:21:40.373 --> 01:21:42.723
- Don't you be sorry.

01:21:42.898 --> 01:21:44.290
You're-- you're gonna make it.

01:21:45.944 --> 01:21:47.990
You're gonna be okay.
You have to...

01:21:48.164 --> 01:21:49.643
You have to believe that.

01:21:49.817 --> 01:21:51.080
You hear me?

01:21:58.130 --> 01:21:59.262
I love you.

01:22:05.355 --> 01:22:07.052
I'm so sorry.

01:22:09.054 --> 01:22:11.665
I'm so sorry about everything.

01:22:11.839 --> 01:22:13.058
[rasping]

01:22:13.232 --> 01:22:14.364
Please.

01:22:14.538 --> 01:22:16.192
Please,
please just stay with me.

01:22:18.890 --> 01:22:20.413
All I want is to go home.

01:22:21.719 --> 01:22:23.851
Oh, can we please just go home?

01:22:24.026 --> 01:22:26.115
Can we please just go home?

01:22:26.289 --> 01:22:29.945
[rasping]

01:22:30.119 --> 01:22:31.207
Alex?

01:22:33.035 --> 01:22:33.949
Alex?

01:22:34.123 --> 01:22:35.037

01:22:35.211 --> 01:22:36.212
Alex?

01:22:37.517 --> 01:22:39.084
Alex...

01:22:42.174 --> 01:22:43.349
- Hey, you.

01:22:46.178 --> 01:22:47.440
- I thought you left me.

01:22:49.529 --> 01:22:53.707
[rasping]

01:22:58.364 --> 01:22:59.887
Oh, please.

01:23:05.415 --> 01:23:07.547
I'm not gonna leave you.

01:23:07.721 --> 01:23:09.506
Don't you leave me.

01:23:09.680 --> 01:23:11.551
- No.

01:23:11.725 --> 01:23:15.033
Don't threaten them.

01:23:17.427 --> 01:23:19.429
- Kwep?

01:23:19.603 --> 01:23:23.650

01:23:33.138 --> 01:23:34.183

Hep?

[growls]

01:24:00.383 --> 01:24:01.601

01:24:01.775 --> 01:24:03.342
Hey, hey Alex?

01:24:05.040 --> 01:24:05.997
Alex?

01:24:06.171 --> 01:24:07.390
No, no...

01:24:07.564 --> 01:24:11.394

01:24:17.139 --> 01:24:18.966
Please help me!

01:24:19.141 --> 01:24:21.186
Anyone, help!

01:24:22.405 --> 01:24:23.754
Help me please!

01:24:25.364 --> 01:24:26.235
Help!

01:24:26.409 --> 01:24:27.627
Anybody!

01:24:27.801 --> 01:24:28.846
Help!

01:24:30.065 --> 01:24:30.978
Help!

[heps rasping]

01:24:33.372 --> 01:24:34.373

[heps rasping]

[helicopter whirring]

01:24:49.823 --> 01:24:51.738
Hey! Hey!

01:24:51.912 --> 01:24:52.739
Hey, hello!

01:24:52.913 --> 01:24:54.263
Help us!

01:24:54.437 --> 01:24:55.655
Help us, please!

01:24:55.829 --> 01:24:57.353
Help me!

Help!

01:25:00.878 --> 01:25:02.097
Help!

01:25:04.534 --> 01:25:05.970
- TIRED GOVERNOR:
Ladies and gentlemen,

01:25:06.144 --> 01:25:07.798
as of 10:00 a.m. this morning,

01:25:07.972 --> 01:25:10.192
my office
is pleased to announce,

01:25:10.366 --> 01:25:13.195
that the outbreak has been
mostly contained in our state.

01:25:14.979 --> 01:25:16.763
Statistically,
the events of the past week

01:25:16.937 --> 01:25:18.809
have been the most significant
in the generation.

01:25:20.115 --> 01:25:22.247
What started out
as a localized outbreak,

01:25:22.421 --> 01:25:26.121
quickly spread,
prompting a statewide emergency.

01:25:26.295 --> 01:25:29.994
The National Guard was deployed,
as were the Army reserves

01:25:30.168 --> 01:25:33.215
in an effort to contain
infected individuals

01:25:33.389 --> 01:25:34.825
and suppress local militias.

01:25:36.609 --> 01:25:39.525
I'd like to thank our military
as well as our first responders

01:25:39.699 --> 01:25:42.137
for the sacrifices
they have made for us

01:25:42.311 --> 01:25:44.574
over the course of this event.

01:25:45.966 --> 01:25:47.490
It was touchy for a while.

01:25:48.969 --> 01:25:51.189
But I believe this shows
the strength of America.

01:25:52.712 --> 01:25:54.714
How we can band together
in times of distinct need

01:25:56.325 --> 01:26:00.329
and do what is necessary
to overcome any obstacle,

01:26:00.503 --> 01:26:03.767
any challenge, any hardship.
[gun shot]

01:26:15.648 --> 01:26:17.215
- Ms. Miller, I wanted to
give you an update

01:26:17.389 --> 01:26:19.086
before we go into surgery.

01:26:19.261 --> 01:26:22.177
Alex has a grade three
splenic laceration

01:26:22.351 --> 01:26:24.396
and likely a few broken ribs.

01:26:24.570 --> 01:26:26.093
A CT scan revealed

01:26:26.268 --> 01:26:28.531
that the bullet stopped just
short of her spinal cord

01:26:28.705 --> 01:26:30.054
and the good news is
that it didn't appear

01:26:30.228 --> 01:26:31.447
to enter her chest cavity.

01:26:31.621 --> 01:26:32.926
So, it didn't hit her heart,
her lungs

01:26:33.100 --> 01:26:35.190
or any of the arteries
in her abdomen.

01:26:35.364 --> 01:26:37.104
I'm gonna go in.
I'm gonna remove the bullet.

01:26:37.279 --> 01:26:40.107
I'm gonna pack the spleen
and we'll proceed from there.

01:26:40.282 --> 01:26:42.980
- Doctor, um...

01:26:43.154 --> 01:26:44.677
You should know that she was...

01:26:46.462 --> 01:26:48.638
She was scratched
by an infected person.

01:26:48.812 --> 01:26:50.205
- Miss Miller, I saw the wound.

01:26:51.554 --> 01:26:53.077
- We can go--
- Miss Miller--

01:26:53.251 --> 01:26:55.645
- Just don't say anything
and I'll take her if--

01:26:55.819 --> 01:26:57.516
- We treated the infection,

01:26:57.690 --> 01:26:59.910
which can be quite serious
if left untreated

01:27:00.084 --> 01:27:01.433
for a long period of time.

01:27:01.607 --> 01:27:04.044
But in Miss Kanai's case,
we caught it early

01:27:04.219 --> 01:27:05.916
and she's responding
to the treatment.

01:27:06.090 --> 01:27:07.483
At this point,
I'm much more concerned

01:27:07.657 --> 01:27:09.224
about the damage to her spleen.

01:27:09.398 --> 01:27:10.660
I'll-- I'll be back with you
as soon as I can

01:27:10.834 --> 01:27:12.096
with another update.

01:27:17.928 --> 01:27:21.323
[indistinct chatter
in background]

01:27:25.588 --> 01:27:27.242
- Lex?

01:27:27.416 --> 01:27:28.504
Hey.

01:27:30.070 --> 01:27:31.637
- [sighs]
- Oh. Easy, here.

01:27:31.811 --> 01:27:34.466
The doctor said
if it hurts to push this.

01:27:34.640 --> 01:27:36.381
And it'll release
more painkillers.

01:27:41.952 --> 01:27:42.996
That better?

01:27:46.783 --> 01:27:48.828
- We need one of these for home.

01:27:53.964 --> 01:27:55.966
How long have I...

01:27:56.140 --> 01:27:57.359
- Couple of days.

01:28:00.100 --> 01:28:01.972
Oh no, don't worry.

01:28:02.146 --> 01:28:03.452
It was treatable.

01:28:06.846 --> 01:28:07.804
Yeah.

01:28:09.806 --> 01:28:11.938
Another day or so,
and we can go home.

01:28:14.724 --> 01:28:16.291
Here, they said your throat
might hurt.

01:28:19.511 --> 01:28:21.426
[chuckles]

01:28:21.600 --> 01:28:23.515
Okay.
How about something cool?

01:28:23.689 --> 01:28:24.777
Ice cream?

01:28:24.951 --> 01:28:26.301
[sighs]

01:28:27.911 --> 01:28:29.391
Yeah.

01:28:29.565 --> 01:28:31.218
- TATER:
Well, they kicked my damn door.

01:28:31.393 --> 01:28:34.091
And they confiscated
every single gun that I own.

01:28:34.265 --> 01:28:35.571
They didn't knock or nothing.

01:28:37.616 --> 01:28:38.835
- Let me see
if I can go get some.

01:28:41.881 --> 01:28:43.230
- BERNIE: Yeah, me too.

01:28:43.405 --> 01:28:44.841
Took a search warrant
to my mom's house.

01:28:45.015 --> 01:28:46.799
Broke half her damn

01:28:46.973 --> 01:28:49.193
trying to move the false wall
to get in to my gun room.

01:28:52.022 --> 01:28:53.371
I was like,

01:28:53.545 --> 01:28:55.373
"I don't why
you're so mad at us?

01:28:55.547 --> 01:28:57.897
We basically just did your job
for you, Mr. Government."

01:28:58.071 --> 01:28:59.290
- TATER: Hmm.

01:28:59.464 --> 01:29:01.597
- They was talking about
jail time,

01:29:01.771 --> 01:29:03.250
talking about pressing charges

01:29:03.425 --> 01:29:05.601
until I told 'em it was
all Big John's idea.

01:29:05.775 --> 01:29:07.646
- Yeah, I said the same thing.

01:29:07.820 --> 01:29:10.301
They made me write it down,
make it all official and shit.

01:29:10.475 --> 01:29:12.390
- TATER: Hmm.
- I said, "Sir.

01:29:12.564 --> 01:29:13.826
"How many times
you gonna ask me

01:29:14.000 --> 01:29:15.741
the same question
over and over again?"

01:29:15.915 --> 01:29:17.308
- TATER: I was in there
for damn near an hour.

01:29:17.482 --> 01:29:19.658
- Mm-hmm. I told him...

01:29:19.832 --> 01:29:21.225
I told him, "I know my rights."

01:29:21.399 --> 01:29:22.792
- Hmm.
- "I'm allowed by the

01:29:22.966 --> 01:29:25.969
constitution to protect myself
and my property."

01:29:26.143 --> 01:29:27.405
Got all red in the face.

01:29:27.579 --> 01:29:28.928
He didn't know what to do
with that, so.

01:29:29.102 --> 01:29:31.670
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, careful now,
you'll wake him.

01:29:31.844 --> 01:29:33.106
- Him?

01:29:33.280 --> 01:29:35.108
No, don't worry about him.

01:29:35.282 --> 01:29:37.023
He's practically a vegetable,
doctor said.

01:29:38.024 --> 01:29:39.243
- Oh...

01:29:40.940 --> 01:29:42.115
Big John...

01:29:43.595 --> 01:29:44.857
Hell, that's a shame.

01:29:46.032 --> 01:29:47.251
- Yep.

01:29:47.425 --> 01:29:48.513
Sure is.

01:29:50.472 --> 01:29:53.257
Problem is we didn't come out

01:29:53.431 --> 01:29:55.172
hard enough on day one.

01:29:55.346 --> 01:29:56.434
- Hmm.
- Make sure everybody knows

01:29:56.608 --> 01:29:58.697
who's in charge.
- Mm-hmm.

01:29:58.871 --> 01:30:01.047
- I mean,
if they ain't afraid of ya,

01:30:01.221 --> 01:30:03.180
how are ya supposed
to do anything?

01:30:03.354 --> 01:30:07.750
- We shoulda had twice as many
guns on at all times.

01:30:07.924 --> 01:30:10.666
- Hell, ain't much
negotiating to be done

01:30:10.840 --> 01:30:12.842
when you're looking down
the wrong end of a bolt action.

01:30:13.016 --> 01:30:14.278
- No, you can't do it.

01:30:14.452 --> 01:30:15.453
- Hmm.

01:30:15.627 --> 01:30:16.889
- Can't do it.

[birds chirping]

01:30:21.111 --> 01:30:22.329
- Oh, thank God.

01:30:22.504 --> 01:30:23.940
It is so good to be home.

01:30:25.158 --> 01:30:26.812
- Alex, I...

01:30:28.510 --> 01:30:30.294
I want to say...

01:30:30.468 --> 01:30:31.817
- I know.
- No.

01:30:31.991 --> 01:30:34.124
Uh, please let me say this.

01:30:36.343 --> 01:30:40.435
I haven't been myself
after Ally.

01:30:42.524 --> 01:30:46.310
I got twisted up,
and I had to find a way to...

01:30:49.792 --> 01:30:53.752
I felt like-- like I was...

01:30:53.926 --> 01:30:55.232
- Like you were trapped?

01:30:57.103 --> 01:31:01.325
- It felt like
all I could try was to run.

01:31:01.499 --> 01:31:04.589
Like, I've always been running.

01:31:05.982 --> 01:31:09.202
But now, it was
from the only person

01:31:09.376 --> 01:31:11.074
who ever made me feel...

01:31:13.685 --> 01:31:14.904
normal.

01:31:17.036 --> 01:31:19.691
But it doesn't matter
where I go.

01:31:19.865 --> 01:31:22.085
It's not about getting away
or going somewhere else.

01:31:22.259 --> 01:31:24.957
It's about
where you choose to be.

01:31:26.916 --> 01:31:28.744
And I choose to be here.

01:31:30.136 --> 01:31:31.181
With you.

01:31:32.704 --> 01:31:33.792
If you will have me.

01:31:45.935 --> 01:31:46.936
I love you.
