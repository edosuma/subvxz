00:03.888 --> 00:07.645
He's drawn his benefits.
So he's alive. And...

00:07.765 --> 00:09.085
And he's not here.

00:09.183 --> 00:12.061
Where's your dignity, woman?
I'm celebrating my freedom.

00:12.062 --> 00:14.996
We're left, living like paupers
in this shit hole,

00:14.997 --> 00:18.417
looking after their kids.
It's madness!

00:18.419 --> 00:20.159
Fra-a-a-ank!

00:24.506 --> 00:27.111
Anyone watching,
thinking we know fuck-all

00:27.231 --> 00:31.364
about knowing fuck-all about owt,
needs to watch their back.

00:31.484 --> 00:34.291
So you've had your Labour,
reclassifying skunk,

00:34.411 --> 00:36.439
sending prices sky-high.

00:36.559 --> 00:40.189
Literally - literally - taking
the grass from its own roots!

00:40.309 --> 00:43.014
Now you've got your ConDemNation...

00:43.134 --> 00:46.435
Liberals noshing Tories like
altar boys picking dimps up.

00:46.555 --> 00:49.501
Have we had a national
fucking stroke?

00:49.621 --> 00:54.328
Or what? Is "revolution" a word?
Or was it never?

00:54.448 --> 00:56.671
Anybody watching needs to know

00:56.791 --> 00:59.933
we cope better than average
with irony in Chatsworth.

01:00.053 --> 01:03.390
Well, for fuck's sake,
we live in Manchester

01:03.510 --> 01:06.214
and they charge us for water!

01:06.334 --> 01:11.503
I wandered lonely as a clown,
necking mushrooms rarely found.

01:11.623 --> 01:15.533
This green and pleasant land
in ancient times.

01:15.653 --> 01:17.261
Yak, yak, yak, yak,
yak, yak, yak, yak!

01:17.381 --> 01:20.544
It's not theirs any more.

01:20.664 --> 01:23.289
This is our England now.

01:23.409 --> 01:25.684
Pa-a-a-arty!

You sure about this?

01:42.775 --> 01:44.986
If I meet it head-on,
then it's done.

01:49.458 --> 01:52.475
In years gone by,
they'd have tied me to a chair

01:52.595 --> 01:54.344
and drowned me in the village pond.

01:54.464 --> 01:59.528
They'd have shaved my head,
branded me, set fire to me,

01:59.648 --> 02:04.692
stuck me inside a fucking
wicker man to purify my soul.

02:08.899 --> 02:13.850
Woe betide any woman who strays,
who dreams of something other...

02:15.902 --> 02:18.127
..dares to make a mistake.

02:20.659 --> 02:21.490
Fucking slag!

02:21.610 --> 02:22.373
Slag.

02:22.493 --> 02:23.441
She's a slag.

02:23.561 --> 02:25.505
I've made mistakes,

02:25.513 --> 02:27.270
maybe more than most.

02:27.286 --> 02:29.442
Aren't they mine, though?

02:29.451 --> 02:32.039
My mistakes. My guilt.

02:32.053 --> 02:33.025
Karen!

02:35.354 --> 02:38.044
Or do a woman's mistakes
belong to everyone?

03:03.866 --> 03:06.044
I can't find the fucking
thing anywhere.

03:07.189 --> 03:08.150
What does it look like?

03:09.966 --> 03:11.223
It's a 24-piece.

03:11.234 --> 03:15.608
Nail-clippers - fingers and
toes, assorted files,

03:15.619 --> 03:20.551

razor-sharp tweezers, two sets...

03:20.566 --> 03:21.095

leather pouch.

03:22.318 --> 03:24.701
(Fuck!)

03:24.713 --> 03:26.971
No, love, I can't picture it.

03:26.978 --> 03:28.292
Should we get a new one?

03:28.302 --> 03:29.707
It's antique.

03:29.721 --> 03:32.138
You'll never track one down.

03:32.146 --> 03:37.613
Besides, it's the last thing
me mum gave me, before...

03:39.424 --> 03:40.317
You know.

03:43.404 --> 03:45.048
Sentimental value.

03:49.445 --> 03:50.463
How are you? How's the kids?

03:50.470 --> 03:53.763
How's yourself?
I haven't seen you for ages.

03:56.119 --> 03:59.333
Like it wasn't bad enough, you've
taken to dressing like a whore.

03:59.338 --> 04:00.857
Where's your dignity, woman?

04:00.869 --> 04:02.319
I'm celebrating my freedom.

04:02.335 --> 04:03.615
I'm not dead yet!

04:06.071 --> 04:07.009
Not from you.

04:08.706 --> 04:12.489
From a life of heartache
and disappointment

04:12.502 --> 04:14.726
at the hands of an alcohol-sodden...

04:16.716 --> 04:17.302
..cuckold.

04:17.317 --> 04:20.144
..cuckold.
Oh. Frank Gallagher.

04:20.160 --> 04:23.192
I'll certainly drink to his demise.

04:24.741 --> 04:26.646
Finished with that?

04:26.656 --> 04:29.039
Hang on. Excuse me.

04:40.400 --> 04:41.384
You all right?

04:43.435 --> 04:44.442
Are you ready for this?

05:11.439 --> 05:12.980
Take him, Mum.

05:16.136 --> 05:18.110
This applies to everyone,

05:18.116 --> 05:20.124

You've got 30 seconds to
say your piece, free-for-all.

05:25.586 --> 05:27.958
After that, if I hear one
bad word against my wife,

05:27.970 --> 05:32.242
I swear to God I'll nail your
fucking knee-caps above the door.

05:35.545 --> 05:37.109
Go.

05:37.123 --> 05:38.686

05:40.927 --> 05:43.799
I fucking hate you for what
you did to him...

05:45.040 --> 05:47.264
..but if he can forgive you,
then so should we.

05:53.573 --> 05:54.659
I always knew you was a...

Mate, can I ask you something?

06:20.065 --> 06:23.108
Right, is it definitely illegal
to have a wank in a public place?

06:23.120 --> 06:24.343
I don't see it, mate.

06:24.356 --> 06:28.241
Must be cos she's family.
Be like banging one off to my gran.

06:28.253 --> 06:29.533
That's sick.

06:29.545 --> 06:31.200
And you having a wank in the middle
of the shop's totally reasonable?

06:31.213 --> 06:33.539
(LAUGHS)

06:33.549 --> 06:34.590
Sorry, Lillian.

06:34.597 --> 06:36.400
Forgot you were there!

06:36.407 --> 06:39.462
Understandable. Sprightly thing,
in't she?

What's she so happy about, anyway?

results online at dinner time.

06:44.082 --> 06:45.737
Not dinner time, lunch time.

06:45.747 --> 06:47.789
Oh, right now, in fact!

06:50.675 --> 06:53.252
Funny word, "wank," don't you think?

06:53.262 --> 06:56.282
It's an old Air Force term. They
used to call the beds "wank pits."

06:56.290 --> 06:58.662
It's not usually the first
thing that comes to mind

06:58.671 --> 07:01.509
when you think of the Battle of
Britain. Biggles, having a wank.

07:01.522 --> 07:03.097

07:14.278 --> 07:15.364

This isn't real.

To the rest of the world, no -
but to you, it's very real.

08:25.745 --> 08:27.776
I'm your subconscious.

08:27.788 --> 08:30.126
The pleasure's all...illusory.

08:35.929 --> 08:38.438
Well, I'm quite pleased to know
me sub-conscious has got style.

08:38.453 --> 08:39.732
I fucking bet you are.

08:39.748 --> 08:45.124

You must be fucking
delighted to see me.

09:02.335 --> 09:05.879

09:05.895 --> 09:08.995
about my taste in
science fiction films?

09:09.005 --> 09:10.467
Don't...

09:10.473 --> 09:12.434
mention science fiction...

09:12.452 --> 09:13.493
ever.

09:13.507 --> 09:16.323

09:22.334 --> 09:24.456
Am I not what you expected?

09:24.467 --> 09:29.877

might harbour your better self?

maybe.

because I need to make this order.

10:23.778 --> 10:25.123
That is the password.

10:25.243 --> 10:27.664
I should know - it's my name
on the account. I am the licensee.

10:27.784 --> 10:29.478
I've got it. Let me.
What?

10:29.598 --> 10:30.961

10:46.232 --> 10:47.843
We changed the name on the account.

When you left with Joe.

10:53.397 --> 10:54.802
I understand.

10:54.818 --> 10:55.961
Made sense.

10:55.968 --> 10:56.917
That's not all.

10:59.199 --> 11:02.464
You were ill. I had
to protect myself.

Oh!

12:31.977 --> 12:33.257
Yeah!

12:33.264 --> 12:37.251
You like that? You want some more,
do you? Bloody hell.

12:37.986 --> 12:39.800
It's a minor cut. Get off.

12:39.813 --> 12:42.629
Jackson, you've got blood
all over your face. Stand still!

12:44.646 --> 12:46.529
Sorry, I had to call.

12:46.545 --> 12:48.359
It's fine, we were just in the pub.

12:48.370 --> 12:50.776
What kind of animal are you?
He's 13 years old!

12:50.790 --> 12:52.172
Er, he attacked me!

12:52.178 --> 12:55.346
Did he steal your lunch money
as well? Give you a wedgie?

12:55.353 --> 12:57.348
I shouted warnings, three times!

12:57.366 --> 13:00.659
"Please, sir,
I've come to stay with my auntie.

13:00.672 --> 13:01.462
Don't hurt me.

13:01.470 --> 13:03.728
Don't hurt me.
You poor thing!

13:03.740 --> 13:06.658
We appreciate your vigilance,
even if it was a little...

13:06.672 --> 13:10.056
enthusiastic. I'm sure there's
no need to press charges.

13:10.072 --> 13:11.192
Charges!

13:11.205 --> 13:13.451
Come on, Jackson.

13:13.469 --> 13:15.647
Auntie, should we seek compensation?

13:15.661 --> 13:16.360
Listen, you little...

13:16.373 --> 13:18.051
Jackson!

13:18.067 --> 13:19.438
Come on!

13:24.847 --> 13:28.004
Listen to me, you little shite-hawk,

13:28.020 --> 13:32.815
if you think I bought one ounce of
the manure you just tried to peddle,

13:32.935 --> 13:34.977
you've got another thing coming.

13:35.097 --> 13:37.353
Now empty your pockets
to pay for the window you broke.

13:37.473 --> 13:41.128
I've heard all about you,
you old witch.

13:41.248 --> 13:42.438
And every bit of it true.

13:46.010 --> 13:47.080
I thought he'd fooled you.

13:47.200 --> 13:48.649
We're Catholics, Elizabeth.

13:48.769 --> 13:51.460
Present a united front
to the outside world,

13:51.475 --> 13:54.484
batter the living shite out
of each other behind closed doors.

13:54.604 --> 13:56.822
It's the way things
have always been.

14:05.339 --> 14:06.675
I would've told you.

14:06.689 --> 14:08.821
I put The Jockey in my name
to protect it.

14:08.839 --> 14:10.187
To protect us.

14:10.193 --> 14:14.670
I understand. Some things happened
because I was ill.

14:14.679 --> 14:17.938
Some things just happened.

14:19.099 --> 14:21.516
I know I've got to earn
your trust, Jamie,

14:21.527 --> 14:23.205
before it's permanent.

14:25.369 --> 14:28.185
I just need some time.

14:30.865 --> 14:33.681
Then you've got it. Two more weeks.

14:44.214 --> 14:45.403
I miss who we used to be.

14:46.769 --> 14:48.288
Where the fuck are those people?

14:54.699 --> 14:55.853
Come.

14:57.310 --> 14:59.238
Sita.

14:59.248 --> 15:00.630
Please, sit.

15:03.906 --> 15:07.063
I thought I might see you today.
I know how much this means to you.

15:15.666 --> 15:18.095
I...

15:18.107 --> 15:20.604
I thought I'd done well.

15:20.617 --> 15:23.524
You did. You did very well.

15:24.164 --> 15:27.165
But it's hard,
and not everyone's cut out for it.

15:27.285 --> 15:28.135
I am!

15:28.255 --> 15:29.193
Maybe nursing.

15:29.313 --> 15:30.623
I want to be a doctor.

15:31.158 --> 15:33.896
I'd be a good doctor.

15:33.909 --> 15:36.053
I gave everything.

15:39.303 --> 15:40.594
Perhaps not everything.

15:46.928 --> 15:50.455
I'd like for you and I
to have sex, Sita.

15:50.575 --> 15:51.857
A lot of sex.

15:51.977 --> 15:55.176
Mostly conventional,
but sometimes...

15:55.189 --> 15:56.275
themed.

15:57.280 --> 15:59.884
Then I might be tempted
to give you a second chance.

16:03.702 --> 16:07.368
I'm sorry about your window. I
wasn't sure it was the right house.

16:07.383 --> 16:11.143
Shut up with your bollocks, son.
I don't buttonn up the back.

16:11.150 --> 16:14.296
What did they tell you
when they sent you to me?

16:14.310 --> 16:16.784
My mam's up in court. Shoplifting.

16:16.798 --> 16:18.544
A misunderstanding.

16:18.558 --> 16:22.375
Plead guilty,
80 hours community service, max.

16:23.660 --> 16:25.929
Fresh start.

16:25.942 --> 16:29.440
Behave yourself while you're
under my roof, we'll get along fine.

16:31.783 --> 16:35.315
What are you? Id? Ego? Super...

16:36.906 --> 16:38.288
..grass?

16:38.301 --> 16:40.195
Freud, really?

16:40.209 --> 16:43.229
Pussy-whipped Viennese sissy
with a mother fixation?

16:43.241 --> 16:47.615
One-size-fits-all theory applies
to the entire piss-soaked wonders

16:47.628 --> 16:50.580
of the Chatsworth human zoo,
does it?

16:50.596 --> 16:52.592
You've got a mouth like a sewer.

16:52.607 --> 16:56.230
I'm your subconscious.
Ooh, what did you expect?

16:56.246 --> 16:59.653
The charm of Cary Grant,
the charisma of Paul Newman,

16:59.660 --> 17:01.406
crossed with the cock
of Errol Flynn?

17:01.417 --> 17:02.936
No.

17:02.948 --> 17:07.595
But maybe a touch
more pleasant than you.

17:07.606 --> 17:10.240
Crossed with the cock
of Errol Flynn.

17:14.520 --> 17:15.787
Embrace who you are.

17:15.805 --> 17:20.327
I can't.
I'm still looking for answers.

17:24.250 --> 17:27.167
Don't waste your time, Tripitaka.

17:27.175 --> 17:30.731
You have no better self,

17:30.745 --> 17:33.401
no moral compass
lurking deep inside,

17:33.409 --> 17:34.848
no paternal goodness,

17:34.858 --> 17:35.990
no honesty,

17:35.999 --> 17:37.244
no kindness,

17:37.255 --> 17:41.379
no deep desire to love and cherish
and commit to Libby Croker.

17:43.830 --> 17:50.662
You are, in fact, merely
the sum of all your behaviour,

17:50.675 --> 17:52.171
and nothing more.

17:55.374 --> 17:57.769
This is as good as it gets
for you, Frank.

18:01.565 --> 18:02.503
Cheers.

18:14.564 --> 18:18.381

Don't say a word

18:18.393 --> 18:21.971

18:21.983 --> 18:24.093
A word.

18:24.106 --> 18:27.616
Yeah, you know that little, er,
little tool kit that I lent you?

18:27.632 --> 18:30.300
Tweezers, pliers,
little nail files.

18:30.313 --> 18:32.696
All really little stuff,

18:32.708 --> 18:34.659
good for getting into small places.

18:43.238 --> 18:45.382
D'you know,
you'd suit a Brazilian, Barry.

18:47.803 --> 18:49.606
I think I know the one, yeah.

18:49.618 --> 18:51.887
Good. I need it back. Pronto.

18:54.512 --> 18:59.057
And it's not a talking bird,
you fucking muppet!

18:59.070 --> 19:00.839
It's a mockingbird.

19:03.554 --> 19:04.572
Mockingbird?

19:09.029 --> 19:13.096
Those clothes are so inappropriate,
you almost qualify as a fetish.

19:13.114 --> 19:15.588
Laugh it up.
I've had a lifetime of it.

19:15.600 --> 19:17.323
Feeling sorry for ourselves, are we?

19:17.333 --> 19:21.161
I am not sorry for myself, mother.

19:21.170 --> 19:22.814
I am devastated for myself!

19:22.830 --> 19:25.759
Kids with curly hair
to a man who could dance.

19:25.768 --> 19:27.036
That was my dream.

19:27.044 --> 19:29.006
Not much to ask for, was it?

19:34.286 --> 19:35.792
You seen my purse?

19:35.810 --> 19:37.613
I'm sure it was in my bag.

19:37.621 --> 19:40.323
4643.

19:40.338 --> 19:42.494
Croker, yeah. C-R...

19:42.504 --> 19:44.330
Aidan!

19:44.336 --> 19:47.106
WOMAN ON COMPUTER MOANS

19:47.116 --> 19:49.226
What? It won't say "porn"
on your bill.

19:51.552 --> 19:52.206
Is she all right?

19:52.221 --> 19:53.239
Is she all right?
Mm.

19:53.249 --> 19:54.904
Mam. Psst!

19:56.899 --> 19:58.122
Little grooming set I lent you?

19:58.135 --> 19:58.857
No?

19:58.870 --> 20:00.423
No?
Nail file, scissors, tweezers.

20:08.883 --> 20:10.675
I think I remember it.

20:10.686 --> 20:12.011
I need it back.

20:12.027 --> 20:13.523
All right, baby father.
I'll have a look.

20:13.529 --> 20:15.194
It's a...

20:15.212 --> 20:16.321
grooming emergency.

20:16.331 --> 20:18.339
I said I'll look.

20:18.354 --> 20:20.453
What's a mockingbird?

20:20.468 --> 20:23.773
A girl who tells you the truth
about your performance in bed.

20:23.785 --> 20:24.883
Now fuck off.

20:26.078 --> 20:27.881
Hiya, love.

20:27.892 --> 20:29.854
Can I have a large vodka, please?
Anything in it?

20:29.866 --> 20:30.678
No.

20:30.696 --> 20:32.965
OK.

20:32.973 --> 20:34.218
You don't drink.

20:34.232 --> 20:35.158
So what did he say?

20:35.176 --> 20:36.592
I passed.

20:36.599 --> 20:39.119
Flying colours, every subject.

20:40.574 --> 20:41.615
You must be made up.

20:41.623 --> 20:43.119
Said he won't for...

20:49.064 --> 20:50.867
Thanks.

20:50.880 --> 20:54.253
Said he won't formalise
the results till I...

20:56.515 --> 20:58.511
Till I fuck him.

21:03.264 --> 21:07.855
The more things change,
the more they stay the same, eh?

21:07.866 --> 21:09.749
You'd think the clever ones
would be spared it.

21:11.115 --> 21:12.679
Will one of you drink
that for me, please?

21:19.820 --> 21:21.088
I'm meeting him tomorrow.

21:51.253 --> 21:52.669
Wow!

21:54.088 --> 21:55.333
(WOLF-WHISTLES)

21:56.763 --> 21:58.088
Remember me?

22:02.003 --> 22:04.045
Right, who needs a beer?

22:04.061 --> 22:05.181
Usual please, Karen.

22:06.263 --> 22:07.463
You OK, son?

22:07.476 --> 22:09.949
Yeah, just great.

22:09.967 --> 22:12.862
I know it's not a great time,
but the manicure set I borrowed you.

22:12.869 --> 22:13.967
The what?

22:13.983 --> 22:15.399
Little scissors, nail files...

22:18.336 --> 22:20.856
BEEPING

22:24.887 --> 22:26.258
CLATTERING

22:30.694 --> 22:32.872
Not sure I've still got
all the bits, Mam.

22:32.880 --> 22:35.946
No matter. Whatever is there,
I need it, quick-style.

22:37.693 --> 22:40.099
Yeah, sure.

22:52.268 --> 22:53.320
Libby?

22:53.329 --> 22:54.392
Yes, love?

22:55.731 --> 22:57.864
Think Aidan's
left something for you.

23:02.657 --> 23:04.153
Ohh!

23:09.859 --> 23:12.231
Fuck off! I just want
to have me pint in peace!

23:12.247 --> 23:15.518
Believe me, if I could go, I would.

23:16.963 --> 23:20.450
You're my subconscious, right?

23:21.741 --> 23:25.683
So every thought I have
ultimately begins with you?

23:25.698 --> 23:28.194
I won't deny it.

23:28.212 --> 23:31.175
So, despite
your rather gloomy outlook

23:31.188 --> 23:34.004
on my person and my character,

23:34.020 --> 23:40.795
how come I want nothing more
than to get the fuck out of here,

23:40.810 --> 23:45.025
find Libby Croker
and put a song in her heart

23:45.039 --> 23:50.665
and a smile on her sweet, kind,
cunny-red mouth?

23:50.672 --> 23:53.146
You can't hide
behind wordplay with me.

23:54.313 --> 23:58.244
Alliteration's no replacement
for substance.

23:58.253 --> 23:59.954
I love her.

24:01.827 --> 24:03.539
And I want to marry her.

24:03.549 --> 24:05.966
No, you fucking don't.

24:05.976 --> 24:07.677
Whose benefit is that for?

24:07.689 --> 24:08.855
There's only us here,

24:08.862 --> 24:11.574
and we both know that
your only living, breathing concern

24:11.592 --> 24:14.021
is for yourself
and your own gratification.

24:14.034 --> 24:16.508
Fuck Libby Croker
and anyone else who gets in the way.

24:16.522 --> 24:18.917
Fuck 'em all.

24:21.413 --> 24:23.352
Have an E.

24:24.806 --> 24:25.938
No.

24:25.946 --> 24:28.602
Oh, don't take the huff.
Don't try and prove me wrong.

24:28.618 --> 24:29.863
You'll just embarrass us both.

24:29.881 --> 24:32.640
Who d'you think you are?
Maximus-fucking-Gladiator?

24:32.656 --> 24:34.857
Off to demonstrate your nobility?

24:35.960 --> 24:38.377
Now, there's a film.
And it's not science fiction.

24:46.778 --> 24:48.535
I'll be seeing you again, Frank.

24:51.198 --> 24:53.058
I'm not so easy
to put back in me box.

24:54.724 --> 24:56.436
Fuck 'em all!

24:57.549 --> 24:59.784
HIGH-HEELED FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING

25:05.832 --> 25:06.964
Who the fuck are you?

25:06.975 --> 25:08.585
I'm your feminine side.

25:09.901 --> 25:11.795
We're not really in touch.

25:27.593 --> 25:28.622
You tired?

25:30.453 --> 25:32.597
Absolutely shattered, as it goes.

25:38.078 --> 25:40.109
Your mum's upstairs with Connor.

25:56.463 --> 25:58.141
We used to be these people.

26:01.183 --> 26:02.372
It's been a long day.

26:06.302 --> 26:07.547
This is what I remember.

26:10.601 --> 26:12.381
Stop it, please.

26:12.390 --> 26:14.455
What's wrong?

26:14.463 --> 26:15.890
You're trying too hard.

26:15.901 --> 26:16.885
You're too...

26:16.901 --> 26:18.875
desperate.

26:18.885 --> 26:19.914
I'm sorry.

26:29.981 --> 26:33.502
The poor little gypo thinks his
mother's in court for shop-lifting.

26:33.508 --> 26:35.675
Excuse my mother's casual racism.

26:35.689 --> 26:37.446
So what's she really done?

26:37.460 --> 26:41.516
Sinead, his mother, my niece,
is a fan of the intravenous drugs.

26:41.529 --> 26:44.321
She's been on the game
on and off for years to pay for it.

26:44.339 --> 26:46.187
Is she a prossie?

26:46.202 --> 26:46.991
So where's Aidan now?

26:47.009 --> 26:47.595
Still in bed.

26:47.604 --> 26:49.748
He is not!

26:49.764 --> 26:52.466
He left the house
at the crack of arse.

26:52.476 --> 26:55.348
He was taking a piss
out the bedroom window.

26:55.364 --> 26:59.704
Now I'm as liberal as the next man,
but my daughter saw his...thing!

27:00.885 --> 27:02.051
DOOR SLAMS

27:02.061 --> 27:03.682
Sita. She slept over.

27:03.694 --> 27:06.020
I told her we'd pay her tutor
a little visit,

27:06.038 --> 27:07.795
but she said it's her problem.

27:07.810 --> 27:08.612
I want to shake his hand.

27:08.620 --> 27:10.025
I want to shake his hand.
Shut the fuck up.

27:11.146 --> 27:13.451
See you later.
Where are you going?

27:13.922 --> 27:15.274
Got a date.

27:17.674 --> 27:19.818
She's not going to
go through with it?

27:31.141 --> 27:32.136
Oi!

27:32.148 --> 27:33.792
In a hurry?

27:33.803 --> 27:35.424
Well...

27:35.440 --> 27:37.937
Good. I want to talk.

27:37.952 --> 27:39.493
When I was 15...

27:41.353 --> 27:43.770
..I used to give hand-jobs

27:43.777 --> 27:47.981
to a lad with a face like lava
flowing down the side of a volcano,

27:47.990 --> 27:51.625
because he'd left school,

27:51.631 --> 27:53.126
had a Volkswagen Golf,

27:53.144 --> 27:55.766
and could drive us
to all the pubs in the town centre.

27:56.773 --> 27:59.042
It was like a transaction.

27:59.050 --> 28:00.125
I'm not proud.

28:00.137 --> 28:03.044
So I'm supposed to just
have sex with this creep?

28:03.053 --> 28:04.685
Good God, no! I never said that.

28:04.698 --> 28:07.161
Sex is the commodity.

28:07.171 --> 28:09.429
He's risking a lot
to get into your pants.

28:09.436 --> 28:11.432
He must really want it.

28:11.448 --> 28:12.841
And you've got it.

28:12.853 --> 28:15.248
By the bucket-load,
if you don't mind me saying.

28:16.664 --> 28:19.844
That puts you
in a very powerful position.

28:19.852 --> 28:21.507
Time to get smart.

28:23.927 --> 28:26.788
What happened to the guy
with the Volkswagen?

28:26.798 --> 28:28.794
I married him.

28:37.090 --> 28:39.609
Ooh, fuck. Y'all right?

28:39.627 --> 28:42.363
Yeah, just...surprised.

28:42.373 --> 28:45.462
I wanted to ask,
little nail file set I lent you...

28:45.468 --> 28:47.692
Scissors and shit,
I need it back quickly.

28:47.708 --> 28:49.352
Y'all right, girls?

28:59.750 --> 29:01.587
Yeah, no sweat.
I know where it is.

29:01.602 --> 29:03.279
Soon as you can, yeah?

29:03.297 --> 29:05.703
There was a couple of bits
missing though.

29:05.718 --> 29:07.157
Don't worry about it.

29:14.799 --> 29:16.704
Oh, Karen, no.
Don't leave.

29:19.362 --> 29:21.381
I'm sorry about last night.
Will you shut up?

29:21.390 --> 29:23.455
I'm only going for the day.

29:23.462 --> 29:26.083
I'll be back tonight,
tomorrow at the latest.

29:26.492 --> 29:29.853
I'm going in as an out-patient,
get my blood levels checked,

29:29.867 --> 29:31.511
and my meds assessed.

29:31.521 --> 29:35.144
Look, it's nothing
to freak out about,

29:35.160 --> 29:37.737
there's no reason to panic.

29:37.744 --> 29:40.298
Trial and error
until we get the meds right.

29:40.310 --> 29:42.488
That's going to be norm for me.

29:42.502 --> 29:43.838
For a while, anyway.

29:45.303 --> 29:48.232
Don't bother with my tea,
I'll get chips.

29:48.245 --> 29:50.514
Where d'you get the money for chips?

29:52.442 --> 29:54.961
I blame the demise
of capital punishment.

29:54.979 --> 29:56.600
You mean corporal.

29:56.611 --> 29:57.982
Do I?

29:59.111 --> 30:02.882
It's sex, aggression.
It's stealing, lying, cursing.

30:02.898 --> 30:05.896
He's a bad little bastard,
all right.

30:05.908 --> 30:07.449
Are you going to eat that cake?

30:07.456 --> 30:10.465
I'm waiting till my tea cools.

30:10.478 --> 30:13.328
I mean, who leaves
a jobby in the fridge?

30:13.344 --> 30:15.124
It's done to shock,

30:15.134 --> 30:17.836
to provoke a reaction.

30:17.844 --> 30:19.579
I'd have rubbed his face in it.

30:19.591 --> 30:22.782
He comes across as all little
big man, but he's not an adult,

30:22.791 --> 30:24.105
he's a child.

30:24.116 --> 30:28.160
Broken home, his mother walking the
streets to support her addiction.

30:28.171 --> 30:29.803
He's crying out for help.

30:29.812 --> 30:32.764
He's crying out
for a toe up the arse.

30:32.779 --> 30:36.892
And if you're not careful,
he'll run rings round you.

30:36.899 --> 30:39.770
They can smell
a soft-touch a mile off.

30:39.788 --> 30:41.796
I am not a soft touch.

30:41.812 --> 30:43.524
Ohh!

30:43.536 --> 30:46.602
Will you get the sole of my foot,
will you?

30:46.615 --> 30:49.010
It's a terrible itch.

30:51.328 --> 30:52.892
Ahh! Oh!

30:52.906 --> 30:55.096
MOBILE RINGS

30:58.718 --> 30:59.747
Hello.

30:59.757 --> 31:02.720
Yes, speaking.

31:02.732 --> 31:05.843
Actually, no, I wasn't aware
Sinead had named me next of kin.

31:07.551 --> 31:08.853
Where is she?

31:08.860 --> 31:11.073
Oh, Mother of God!

31:11.081 --> 31:13.737
No, thank you,
we'll wait for your call.

31:16.036 --> 31:20.553
They've sent Sinead to prison
for 18 months. That poor boy!

31:20.673 --> 31:21.384
Hmm.

31:21.504 --> 31:23.419
I suppose he'll have to
stay here with us.

31:23.539 --> 31:25.580
Over my dead body!

31:36.530 --> 31:37.810
Frank?

31:42.211 --> 31:43.798
Hiya, Karen.

31:45.755 --> 31:47.114
Frank?

31:53.524 --> 31:55.043
Oh, what the fuck?!

31:55.055 --> 31:56.767
Is this another dream?

31:56.780 --> 31:59.675
Cos I've just about had it
with fucking dreams.

31:59.684 --> 32:01.077
What you on about, you tit?

32:01.090 --> 32:03.473
Where've you been?
Everybody's been frantic.

32:09.020 --> 32:12.359
C'mon... Just...
All right, it's all right.

32:12.372 --> 32:15.518
Just tell me something
that I couldn't possibly know,

32:16.133 --> 32:20.290
just to prove that you're real and
not some drug-induced hallucination.

32:20.410 --> 32:21.587
Fuck off!
Please.

32:21.639 --> 32:22.825
No!
Please!

32:24.413 --> 32:26.826
Jamie's cum tastes of asparagus.

32:27.977 --> 32:28.801
Pardon?

32:28.813 --> 32:31.681
Well, he eats it instead of snacks,
like a health kick thing.

32:31.801 --> 32:35.255
It's got vitamin A and vitamin C,
so, his jizz...

32:38.795 --> 32:41.018
I really hope that you're real,

32:41.036 --> 32:44.341
cos if my subconscious
invented that,

32:44.349 --> 32:46.539
I'm more fucked than I thought.

32:52.247 --> 32:54.653
Are you all right?

32:54.661 --> 32:57.454
Ohh, I... I don't know, kid.

32:59.606 --> 33:02.149
Everybody's been worried.
Libby, she's...

33:03.199 --> 33:04.968
Have you been here this whole time?

33:09.527 --> 33:11.102
I'm not sure.

33:18.419 --> 33:20.063
Why's he always sucking that stuff?

33:20.183 --> 33:22.256
Dunno.

33:22.376 --> 33:25.465
By the way, that nail-clipper
thing you wanted...

33:25.470 --> 33:26.522
I leant it to her.

33:26.534 --> 33:27.723
Lillian?

33:27.736 --> 33:30.005
I was using a file
to scrape off sell-by dates.

33:30.018 --> 33:31.104
Asked if she could borrow it.

33:31.122 --> 33:32.515
Personal grooming set?

33:32.523 --> 33:34.087
It's round ours.

33:34.100 --> 33:35.812
Sweet.

33:35.828 --> 33:38.393
I think I gave it to Brandi though.

33:38.402 --> 33:39.807
And you gave it to Tricia.

33:41.439 --> 33:43.105
And she lost it.

33:45.642 --> 33:47.013
Can I have the flat keys?

33:47.029 --> 33:49.173
You're not shagging
your tutor there!

33:49.183 --> 33:52.238
No, I'm not! He's coming here.
I need somewhere to get ready.

33:54.050 --> 33:55.694
I can hardly meet him at uni!

34:01.344 --> 34:03.090
This isn't as much fun as I thought.

34:03.103 --> 34:05.622
Is that all you've got to say?
She's your cousin.

34:05.640 --> 34:07.215
Bothers you so much,
go do something about it.

34:07.229 --> 34:08.759
Fine! I will.

34:10.600 --> 34:12.083
Sita! Wait!

34:16.237 --> 34:17.266
Don't do it.

34:17.277 --> 34:18.455
What?

34:18.466 --> 34:20.371
Being a doctor is just a job.

34:20.382 --> 34:21.810
There's other jobs.

34:21.818 --> 34:23.596
Not for me.

34:23.972 --> 34:26.489
I've worked for this. Told everyone
it's what I'm going to be.

34:26.610 --> 34:28.658
Who gives a fuck what they think?

34:29.024 --> 34:30.213
I failed.

34:33.833 --> 34:35.250
I failed, all right?

34:37.469 --> 34:39.726
And he's offered me a way ahead.

34:39.963 --> 34:41.610
What a scumbag.

34:41.730 --> 34:42.987
Me or him?

34:47.190 --> 34:49.335
Let me help.

34:53.509 --> 34:57.655
Thanks, Carl.
I just wasn't sure how he'd take it.

34:57.673 --> 35:00.033
When you called
I thought it was about me dad.

35:00.044 --> 35:03.451
Why would I call about him?
I've no interest in him.

35:03.464 --> 35:05.210
Huh!

35:05.216 --> 35:07.872
You might have no interest,
but he's still me dad.

35:07.886 --> 35:09.279
He's still missing.

35:20.201 --> 35:21.582
What?

35:22.904 --> 35:24.435
Come into the living room, sit.

35:24.529 --> 35:25.519
No. What?

35:26.905 --> 35:27.791
Is it my mum?

35:31.740 --> 35:34.157
Look, I know she's a tart...

35:34.168 --> 35:35.209
Watch your mouth!

35:35.216 --> 35:37.872
Well, she is. So what?
She's an addict.

35:37.914 --> 35:41.234
She needs to get money.
What have they done to her?

35:41.240 --> 35:42.178
Mm...

35:42.194 --> 35:43.701
Your mam's in jail, kiddo.

35:46.916 --> 35:47.900
How long?

35:49.469 --> 35:50.965
18 months.

35:59.813 --> 36:01.878
I want me mum!

36:03.079 --> 36:05.690
Well, don't just stand there!

36:05.705 --> 36:09.397
BOTH SOB

36:12.927 --> 36:15.242
I think these
are a very good idea.

36:15.260 --> 36:16.803
At least for tonight.

36:16.809 --> 36:17.884
How is he?

36:17.896 --> 36:21.098
I think the poor kid's always known
that Sinead was on the game.

36:21.113 --> 36:22.757
Still his mam, though.

36:24.240 --> 36:25.667
We'll keep him here, then?

36:27.072 --> 36:29.489
Is that all right?

36:29.505 --> 36:31.183
Yeah, course it is.

36:31.197 --> 36:32.829
He's had a lot to deal with.

36:40.820 --> 36:43.454
I hate 'em all judging me.

36:43.468 --> 36:43.849
Who?

36:43.860 --> 36:44.821
Who?
Everybody.

36:46.156 --> 36:47.527
Punters...

36:47.543 --> 36:50.290
family...

36:50.297 --> 36:52.077
Jamie.

36:52.087 --> 36:53.469
I can feel their eyes on me.

36:55.197 --> 36:56.385
Fuck 'em all!

36:57.367 --> 37:01.080
Is that your considered opinion,
"Fuck 'em all"?

37:01.200 --> 37:02.663
No, not literally.

37:02.677 --> 37:05.914
Mind you, there was a time,
y'know, back in the day,

37:05.920 --> 37:09.304
I wouldn't have put it
past you, like...

37:09.319 --> 37:13.089
Anyway, who are they
to cast a stone at you, eh?

37:13.107 --> 37:17.368
Let he who is without sin etc.

37:17.379 --> 37:20.274
Why would you waste the energy
giving a shit?

37:26.246 --> 37:28.515
It doesn't have to be unpleasant.

37:28.525 --> 37:29.691
We could be friends.

37:29.697 --> 37:31.830
This isn't how you make friends.

37:31.838 --> 37:35.723
Friendships don't recover
from beginnings like this.

37:39.514 --> 37:41.124
Irony is...

37:41.132 --> 37:42.480
I had a crush on you.

37:43.696 --> 37:45.499
It wouldn't have taken much.

37:48.100 --> 37:51.769
Seems we both have something
the other desires.

37:56.796 --> 37:57.859
I want to fuck you.

37:58.807 --> 37:59.996
Now.

38:03.683 --> 38:04.678
Sorry?

38:04.690 --> 38:06.982
Here. Now.

38:06.992 --> 38:08.215
Now?

38:11.670 --> 38:14.417
Give me a minute, then follow.

38:37.010 --> 38:38.722
(MOANS)

38:52.665 --> 38:53.774
Take your trousers down.

38:54.403 --> 38:55.493
Pull yourself off.

38:56.319 --> 38:58.582
I want you ready.
I'm so nearly there.

38:58.702 --> 38:59.464
I will.

38:59.680 --> 39:01.487
I wasn't expecting
to work this hard.

39:02.494 --> 39:04.972
This'll be better.

39:05.203 --> 39:07.575
This'll be a better angle. Ahh.

39:09.795 --> 39:11.131
Oh, that's good.

39:11.146 --> 39:13.233
(GROANS)

39:18.070 --> 39:19.236
(GROANS)

39:20.571 --> 39:22.090
Ow!

39:22.103 --> 39:23.747
That hurt!

39:26.332 --> 39:27.394
What...?

39:27.412 --> 39:29.192
Who are you?

39:29.204 --> 39:30.916
You're a fucking scumbag.

39:30.927 --> 39:32.195
Wait.

39:35.442 --> 39:36.983
All right.

39:36.991 --> 39:38.009
I'll pass you.

39:38.016 --> 39:40.058
Next time, I want to earn it.

39:40.073 --> 39:43.401
Not like this, by studying.

39:43.414 --> 39:44.637
Whatever you want.

39:46.310 --> 39:48.727
Go on Sita, I'll catch you up.

39:48.738 --> 39:50.052
Is it your girlfriend?

39:50.060 --> 39:52.307
Why would that matter?

39:52.317 --> 39:53.335
Ah!

39:56.019 --> 39:59.551
(GROANS)

40:02.238 --> 40:04.257
What they got you on, Largactil?

40:04.268 --> 40:05.912
None of your business.

40:05.927 --> 40:07.070
Right.

40:08.365 --> 40:10.782
What should I tell Libby?

40:10.789 --> 40:13.592
Nothing. We'll sort it out
when I see her. It'll be fine.

40:13.610 --> 40:15.083
Don't know about that, Frank.

40:15.097 --> 40:17.799
She's a mess. She thinks
you've done a runner.

40:17.810 --> 40:19.192
But I haven't.

40:19.199 --> 40:20.331
I've just been...

40:22.780 --> 40:24.116
..lost.

40:24.131 --> 40:25.957
Still, the whole tramp thing.

40:25.966 --> 40:29.589
I mean, I've had problems,
but there's no video evidence.

40:29.604 --> 40:31.930
It's just been a misunderst...

40:31.939 --> 40:33.196
What tramp thing?

40:33.209 --> 40:34.477
YouTube.

40:34.487 --> 40:36.768
Out your box on your stag-night.

40:36.783 --> 40:39.371
Some biddy riding you
like there's no tomorrow.

40:42.133 --> 40:43.572
I never shagged her.

40:43.586 --> 40:45.901
It looks like you shagged her.

40:45.911 --> 40:47.589
Ahh. Couldn't get a stiffie?

40:47.604 --> 40:48.622
What?

40:48.636 --> 40:50.849
No. No, smart arse.

40:50.859 --> 40:54.642
Little Frank can still conduct
the Berlin Philharmonic if required.

40:54.657 --> 40:58.167
Ah, fuckin'...
I need to get back home, Karen.

40:58.182 --> 40:59.200
I need to see her.

41:03.783 --> 41:04.778
You all right?

41:06.895 --> 41:07.947
Did you...?

41:07.962 --> 41:10.630
I don't really wanna talk about it.

41:12.673 --> 41:16.922
Is it all right if I stay over,
maybe watch a film?

41:17.613 --> 41:18.551
Of course.

41:21.607 --> 41:22.534
Sita.

41:24.705 --> 41:25.803
I'm sorry.

41:27.726 --> 41:31.884
Right, so we've got
An Education,

41:31.900 --> 41:33.498
To Sir, With Love.

41:36.529 --> 41:38.241
Are you sure? That's a...

41:38.256 --> 41:39.718
Yeah, I know what it is.

41:42.584 --> 41:43.298
What is it?

41:43.418 --> 41:44.567
Throbbin' Hood, Prince of Meat.

41:44.687 --> 41:46.422
I've got the horn, all right?

41:46.437 --> 41:47.364
It's not a crime.

41:51.042 --> 41:52.253
Poor kid.

41:52.261 --> 41:53.040
How long's he gonna be with you?

41:53.047 --> 41:54.695
Well, as long as.

41:54.815 --> 41:57.051
Who knows what shape his mum'll
be in when she gets out.

41:57.089 --> 41:58.861
The things we do to our kids, eh?

41:58.981 --> 42:00.920
Everything we do has an impact.

42:00.929 --> 42:03.392
You can almost see
all your own flaws

42:03.405 --> 42:06.391
and failings
in the character of your kids.

42:06.401 --> 42:09.308
Libby's flaws and failings...

42:10.708 --> 42:12.704
..are entirely her own.

42:15.657 --> 42:18.040
I had it in me hand.
Chesney's cousin leant it me.

42:18.048 --> 42:19.225
So where the fuck is it, then?

42:19.237 --> 42:20.539
I gave it to Trixie.

42:20.546 --> 42:23.201
She's got a terrible
ingrowing toe-nail.

42:23.219 --> 42:26.160
That's the last that was seen of it.
It's been lifted from her room.

42:26.172 --> 42:27.884
It's an antique. Irreplacable.

42:27.892 --> 42:30.718
Yeah, a precious family heirloom.
He was supposed to look after it.

42:30.838 --> 42:32.033
You know, I trusted you.

42:32.045 --> 42:33.410
I trusted her.

42:33.530 --> 42:34.743
If you can't trust
your own mam, then...

42:34.863 --> 42:36.124
Hold the accusations.

42:36.244 --> 42:39.373
My eldest was in need,
and I give it to him.

42:39.493 --> 42:40.801
Show me a mother who wouldn't.

42:40.810 --> 42:42.454
I leant it to
a fucking Gallagher

42:42.463 --> 42:44.050
and now I get robbed
out of a brothel.

42:44.059 --> 42:45.657
How am I getting the fucking blame?

42:45.668 --> 42:49.655
Does no-one is this place ever take
responsibility for their actions?

42:54.080 --> 42:57.226
Actually...it's here.

42:57.239 --> 42:59.133
It's been here all the time.
Bottom of me bag.

42:59.253 --> 43:01.156
You must've lifted
it from Trixie's room.

43:01.276 --> 43:02.767
Come to think of it...

43:02.887 --> 43:04.118
I must've done.

43:04.399 --> 43:05.895
Oi, Ironside!

43:05.904 --> 43:08.060
This belongs to me.

43:08.180 --> 43:08.807
What?

43:08.984 --> 43:11.477
"Property of P Croker".

43:26.457 --> 43:28.351
Oh, yeah.

43:28.364 --> 43:31.726
What was all that shit about, the
last thing my mother ever gave me?

43:31.741 --> 43:34.966
Well, I couldn't remember
where I'd fucking got it.

43:34.977 --> 43:36.279
You ever fucking...

43:36.287 --> 43:37.406
(ALL SHOUT AT ONCE)

43:37.424 --> 43:38.282
Why am I a part of this?

43:38.300 --> 43:40.308
I gave it to him,
he gave it to me...

43:40.324 --> 43:42.423
How have I...?

43:42.432 --> 43:45.066
(HUBBUB CONTINUES)

43:50.036 --> 43:52.829
I didn't see you come in,
everything all right?

43:52.844 --> 43:53.782
Yeah.

43:55.227 --> 43:56.359
Did they say much?

43:58.260 --> 44:00.803
Spoke to a wise man, though.

44:00.813 --> 44:04.220
He told me never to let
anyone cast the first stone.

44:04.228 --> 44:05.496
A wise man?

44:05.506 --> 44:09.516
Well, he's a complete arsehole,
but sentiment's the same.

44:12.202 --> 44:13.595
That reminds me.

44:21.446 --> 44:23.465
Frank.

44:23.474 --> 44:24.754
My Frank!

44:24.770 --> 44:27.199
I never doubted you for a second!

44:29.349 --> 44:30.663
'Nature is a total bastard.'

44:30.679 --> 44:32.618
I'm coming, Frank!

44:32.628 --> 44:35.591
"We're all defined by it.
Trapped by it.'

44:37.583 --> 44:39.102
'It is true.

44:39.114 --> 44:42.851
'I have breasts, a vagina,
reproductive organs.

44:43.777 --> 44:47.093
'I know men are genetically
programmed to want that.'

44:51.781 --> 44:55.928
'But it's not nature that judges us,
that pigeon-holes us, calls us slags

44:55.936 --> 45:00.686
'for the clothes we wear,
the life we want, the sex we have.

45:00.701 --> 45:03.061
'It's not nature that
puts us in prison.'

45:11.042 --> 45:14.233
'I, for one,
am tired of being judged.

45:14.245 --> 45:16.492
'I'm done with that.'

45:18.902 --> 45:20.705
I'm getting out. For you.

45:20.713 --> 45:22.799
I'll wed you, Libby Croker.

45:22.910 --> 45:24.064
Did you miss me?

45:24.076 --> 45:26.971
Monica's trying to nullify the
divorce! Stop us getting married!

45:26.981 --> 45:29.091
I've got 24 hours to pull
together a wedding.

45:29.099 --> 45:31.720
Like a pig in fucking clogs.

45:31.738 --> 45:33.769
Thought you might need one of these.

45:33.776 --> 45:34.965
Who am I kidding?

45:34.973 --> 45:38.005
There won't be any wedding!
They're never going to let him out.

45:38.020 --> 45:39.095
Fra-a-a-ank!

45:40.413 --> 45:41.579
Monica wins, we lose.

45:41.594 --> 45:43.613
