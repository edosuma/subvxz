WEBVTT

00:35.869 --> 00:38.663
Ah...

00:51.509 --> 00:52.469
Hm...

00:52.844 --> 00:55.346
Mm-mm.

00:56.139 --> 00:57.599
Ah...

00:57.849 --> 00:59.059
Mmwah.

01:04.647 --> 01:05.982
Huh?

01:43.978 --> 01:44.896
Huh.

01:52.529 --> 01:53.655
Ah...

01:57.659 --> 01:59.536
Hm...

02:05.792 --> 02:07.544
Huh? Tsk.

02:14.342 --> 02:15.301
Hm?

02:15.552 --> 02:16.803
-Huh?

02:19.848 --> 02:21.182
Agh!

02:21.558 --> 02:24.102
Thra, what has happened to you?

02:28.815 --> 02:31.818
Oh, unhand me! I do not need your help.

02:32.485 --> 02:33.528
Goodness!

02:33.653 --> 02:35.029
You are old.

02:35.280 --> 02:39.200
You were a childling
when last I laid my eye upon you.

02:43.705 --> 02:45.331
-Your grandfather?
-Mm-hmm.

02:45.415 --> 02:47.458
How long have I been gone this time?

02:49.460 --> 02:52.130
Uh...

02:53.089 --> 02:54.132
That long?

02:54.215 --> 02:57.010
Yet, still not long enough
to see the entire Universe.

02:57.093 --> 02:58.136
I could tell you that.

02:58.803 --> 03:02.807
Ugh, sending my mind,
projecting my awareness through the stars

03:02.891 --> 03:06.144
is no easy feat, not even for Aughra.

03:08.021 --> 03:11.941
These legs are asleep. Wake up!
Wake up, legs!

03:13.943 --> 03:16.321
-Get help? I am help!<i></i>
-Uh...

03:16.404 --> 03:18.781
This pain,

03:19.157 --> 03:20.450
this awakening...

03:20.742 --> 03:24.621
can only mean some calamity
has befallen Thra while I was away.

03:24.704 --> 03:28.625
Aughra must find out what has happened

03:28.833 --> 03:30.335
and set things right,

03:30.668 --> 03:32.503
if I'm not already too late.

03:35.840 --> 03:37.550
-What are you waiting for?

03:37.634 --> 03:39.552
-Get my scrolls!

03:39.677 --> 03:40.762
Now!

04:50.999 --> 04:53.084
Hello? Is someone there?

04:58.965 --> 05:00.008
Aw...

05:02.802 --> 05:05.763
-Oh! I'm sorry.

05:10.059 --> 05:11.519
-Good morning.

05:11.602 --> 05:13.563
This is my first time above ground.

05:14.480 --> 05:17.525
My name is Deet. Can you talk?

05:20.486 --> 05:22.030
I'll take that as a no.

05:24.032 --> 05:26.034
It's all right. See?

05:26.409 --> 05:28.745
-Nothing to be afraid of.

05:28.870 --> 05:30.663
-There you go.

05:31.497 --> 05:33.833
-You like having your belly rubbed?

05:34.375 --> 05:36.753
I guess so. I'll rub your belly.

05:37.295 --> 05:38.963
-Here.

05:39.213 --> 05:40.965
I'm all by myself too.

05:42.008 --> 05:44.135
Maybe you can come to Ha'rar with me.

05:44.719 --> 05:46.804
It would be nice to have some company.

06:01.194 --> 06:03.905
-Uh...

06:10.203 --> 06:12.538
-I guess you better go.

06:46.406 --> 06:50.868
Disaster! Disaster!

06:50.952 --> 06:53.454
Traitor. Must find traitor.

06:53.996 --> 06:55.706
Keep your eyes sharp!

06:56.582 --> 07:01.421
None may enter or exit the castle
without your lords' blessing.

07:01.712 --> 07:04.132
We will not fail you, my lord.

07:04.340 --> 07:05.925
I do hope not...

07:06.634 --> 07:12.181
for the sake of all
the good and loyal creatures of Thra.

07:15.143 --> 07:18.312
So hard to find good help these days.

07:23.109 --> 07:24.735
Escape is impossible.

07:24.944 --> 07:27.321
I have positioned guards at every exit.

07:27.822 --> 07:30.867
Even now, we are sweeping the castle,
chamber by chamber.

07:30.992 --> 07:32.618
Rian will be found.

07:32.785 --> 07:34.787
The guards will ask questions.

07:35.705 --> 07:37.498
Those questions will grow louder

07:38.124 --> 07:40.877
when they notice
another of their rank is missing.

07:41.043 --> 07:42.879
This Mira.

07:42.962 --> 07:46.299
Let us see them try to ask their questions
through broken teeth.

07:46.382 --> 07:50.178
-Two questions answer one another.
- Wait!

07:50.261 --> 07:51.095
Hm?

07:51.179 --> 07:52.847
Explain yourself, Chamberlain.

07:52.930 --> 07:55.558
Is no need for breaking teeth.

07:56.017 --> 07:58.144
Why do we search for Rian?

07:58.352 --> 07:59.979
Where is missing Mira?

08:02.023 --> 08:03.316
Is obvious.

08:03.774 --> 08:07.570
Rian murdered Mira. How tragic!

08:07.653 --> 08:08.529
Hm...

08:09.489 --> 08:12.658
The Gelfling will never believe
one of them killed their own.

08:12.867 --> 08:14.535
Of course will believe.

08:14.660 --> 08:18.122
Gelfling have always believed
Chamberlain's whispers, yes?

08:18.706 --> 08:20.500
This is what I do.

08:20.958 --> 08:24.712
I plant stories in ground,
watch grow into truth.

08:24.795 --> 08:28.007
-Keep Gelfling looking over shoulder,

08:28.090 --> 08:31.344
and they won't ever see
what's right in front of them.

08:31.427 --> 08:35.681
Ugh, why waste our time with talk
when we have talons?

08:37.558 --> 08:39.602
-The Chamberlain speaks true.
-Mm...

08:39.685 --> 08:42.230
Let us utilize a light touch

08:42.313 --> 08:45.191
until the traitor Rian
is back in our grasp.

08:45.274 --> 08:47.944
-But, Emperor--
-You are excused, General.

08:49.695 --> 08:51.239
As you wish, Emperor.

08:54.492 --> 08:55.743
Hmm...

08:56.869 --> 08:58.496
-General.
-Weakling.

08:58.579 --> 08:59.705
Oh!

09:00.706 --> 09:06.128
-Ah, Scientist, at last.
-I arrive at your summons, Emperor!

09:06.212 --> 09:07.922
Give me some of that essence.

09:08.798 --> 09:10.591
-But there is no more.
-What?

09:11.050 --> 09:13.844
-No more?
-You, uh...

09:13.970 --> 09:16.472
-We consumed it all.
- Lies!

09:16.556 --> 09:18.349
I saw you lock a vial away.

09:18.474 --> 09:21.143
A paltry amount for further study.

09:21.227 --> 09:23.646
Make more!

09:23.729 --> 09:25.398
That is impossible, Emperor!

09:25.481 --> 09:29.151
My machine was incapacitated
during the initial draining.

09:29.277 --> 09:32.280
It will require repairs. I need time.

09:32.363 --> 09:33.906
-Fix it!

09:34.031 --> 09:37.243
Of course, Emperor. With haste.

09:38.160 --> 09:40.371
With haste, yes.

09:46.711 --> 09:49.130
You seem distressed, Emperor.

09:49.338 --> 09:52.800
Perhaps some pleasant distraction
would be good, yes?

09:52.883 --> 09:53.843
Yes.

09:54.427 --> 09:56.637
-Yes.
-Musicians!

09:56.971 --> 10:00.308
Play for your Emperor!

10:12.862 --> 10:15.072
Quieter! Quieter!

10:23.497 --> 10:25.958
Ah... Better. Yes.

10:26.626 --> 10:27.835
Ahh...

10:34.342 --> 10:35.259
Drenchen!

10:36.969 --> 10:39.138
Drenchen? You know my name, Tolyn.

10:39.221 --> 10:41.474
How many cold patrols
have we walked together?

10:41.557 --> 10:43.225
Since when am I just "Drenchen"?

10:43.309 --> 10:47.063
Since your best friend broke his oath
and killed Mira.

10:47.647 --> 10:49.231
What? Rian?

10:49.523 --> 10:50.483
That can't be.

10:50.691 --> 10:54.278
Lord Chamberlain told us
of the traitor's crime personally.

10:54.820 --> 10:56.781
But he loved Mira. He would--
he would never--

10:56.864 --> 10:59.075
-Tell us where Rian is!

10:59.158 --> 11:01.035
Easy, Tolyn. I don't know.

11:01.494 --> 11:03.079
Think carefully, Drenchen.

11:03.329 --> 11:04.955
Are you loyal to the traitor

11:05.039 --> 11:08.000
-or to your oath?
-To my oath, same as you.

11:08.084 --> 11:11.087
-Be sure it stays that way.
-Hmph.

11:14.548 --> 11:16.759
What a couple of--

11:19.303 --> 11:21.055
-Rian!

11:21.180 --> 11:23.182
-What happened? I waited!
-Be quiet.

11:23.307 --> 11:24.308
But everyone's gone mad.

11:24.392 --> 11:26.769
-They're saying that--
-No, not here. Follow me.

11:27.019 --> 11:27.895
Quickly.

11:30.564 --> 11:31.732
Gurjin, this way!

11:41.283 --> 11:42.535
We should be safe here.

11:43.869 --> 11:46.497
-I need your help to escape the castle.
-Rian, stop.

11:48.874 --> 11:50.042
What's going on?

11:50.126 --> 11:52.294
All the exits are guarded,
but there must be another way out.

11:52.378 --> 11:54.171
-Where's Mira?
-We can get to the catacombs--

11:54.255 --> 11:56.799
They're saying she's dead.
They're saying you killed her.

11:56.882 --> 11:59.760
-Who's saying that?
-The guards, the Skeksis, everyone.

12:00.803 --> 12:04.390
-That's a lie! You can't believe that I--
-I don't know what to believe.

12:07.101 --> 12:08.102
Dreamfast with me.

12:08.936 --> 12:11.897
Trust me, Gurjin,
you have to see the truth for yourself.

12:18.863 --> 12:21.240
-<i> Be welcome, Gelfling.</i>
-<i> Please.</i>

12:21.323 --> 12:25.661
<i>-My lords! Help me!</i>
-<i> Give the Crystal everything.</i>

12:25.745 --> 12:28.706
<i>Give it your very essence!</i>

12:31.000 --> 12:32.334
Enough!

12:33.669 --> 12:34.587
Poor Mira.

12:35.713 --> 12:36.797
She's gone.

12:41.010 --> 12:42.052
She loved you.

12:43.137 --> 12:44.555
And you.

12:47.641 --> 12:49.268
Mira deserves justice.

12:49.560 --> 12:51.103
They'll try to stop us.

12:51.312 --> 12:52.229
Us?

12:52.313 --> 12:53.814
I go where you go.

12:54.398 --> 12:57.860
-No. No, it is too dangerous.
-Mira would do the same for us.

12:57.943 --> 13:00.571
She wouldn't take no for an answer,
and neither will I.

13:02.948 --> 13:03.783
All right.

13:04.325 --> 13:05.284
Together, then.

13:06.827 --> 13:07.745
So...

13:08.204 --> 13:10.247
do you have a...
a plan?

13:10.790 --> 13:11.665
Yes.

13:13.083 --> 13:14.627
But you're not gonna like it.

13:15.169 --> 13:16.086
Uh...

14:00.631 --> 14:02.758
Hi! My name's Deet.

14:02.842 --> 14:03.843
And you are?

14:12.268 --> 14:13.561
This way!

14:13.644 --> 14:14.937
-Maybe?

14:15.020 --> 14:16.188
No!

14:17.898 --> 14:18.899
Maybe I lost it!

14:19.942 --> 14:21.360
Oh, no!

14:25.030 --> 14:27.074
I used to get along with animals!

14:46.927 --> 14:48.304
You don't have to eat me.

14:49.096 --> 14:52.224
We could be friends!
Wouldn't that be nice?

14:56.770 --> 14:58.022
Huh?

15:08.741 --> 15:10.576
Wait! Be careful!

15:23.172 --> 15:24.298
Where'd he go?

15:26.967 --> 15:28.010
Disaster!

15:28.928 --> 15:30.846
- Oh, no!

15:36.393 --> 15:38.270
-Watch out!

15:40.940 --> 15:42.149
Let me help!

15:44.985 --> 15:45.986
I'm sorry!

15:46.070 --> 15:47.571
No! <i>Dede!</i>

15:48.405 --> 15:50.491
<i>-Dede?</i>
-Again! Again!

16:08.342 --> 16:09.259
Are you all right?

16:15.891 --> 16:17.101
That was amazing!

16:19.186 --> 16:21.063
-Thank you.
-Hup!

16:21.146 --> 16:23.899
-Hup. Is that your name?
-Mm-hmm. Hup!

16:24.858 --> 16:26.235
Oh, let me help you.

16:27.611 --> 16:29.363
Thank you much, <i>aminya.</i>

16:31.573 --> 16:33.659
There. My name's Deet.

16:34.201 --> 16:36.912
-I'm a Gelfling.
-Oh!

16:37.162 --> 16:38.497
Lady Deet.

16:38.580 --> 16:39.915
-Ah!

16:40.499 --> 16:44.169
-Podling.
-Oh, I've never met a Podling before.

16:44.253 --> 16:45.129
-Oh!

16:45.212 --> 16:48.966
Nice to meet you, Podling Hup.
I'm lucky you came along.

16:54.013 --> 16:56.265
Sorry, I don't understand.

16:56.348 --> 16:58.350
Oh... Oh!

16:59.768 --> 17:01.228
Ha... ah?

17:01.979 --> 17:02.896
Uh...

17:03.188 --> 17:05.649
You have a magic spoon?

17:05.733 --> 17:08.027
Mm? Uh... ha!

17:10.112 --> 17:13.490
-Oh, it's a sword!
-Mm-mm. Sword, yeah.

17:15.367 --> 17:17.077
-You're a Paladin!
-Oh...

17:17.327 --> 17:18.871
Not yet, Paladin.

17:21.540 --> 17:22.666
All-Maudra.

17:22.750 --> 17:25.335
Oh, I see!
You're on your way to Ha'rar

17:25.461 --> 17:28.338
to see the All-Maudra
to become a Paladin.

17:28.422 --> 17:30.799
-Hup!
-Are there many Podling Paladins?

17:30.883 --> 17:33.886
Mm-mm.
Hup. Paladin. First, yeah.

17:33.969 --> 17:36.138
-Oh, how noble!

17:37.639 --> 17:41.602
I'm also on my way to Ha'rar
to warn the All-Maudra of the Darkening.

17:42.061 --> 17:43.645
Perhaps we could travel together.

17:50.611 --> 17:52.821
I'll take that as a yes.

17:52.905 --> 17:56.158
-Mm-hm!
-All right! Off we go! To Ha'rar!

17:56.241 --> 17:57.785
To Ha'rar!

18:02.372 --> 18:03.332
Hm?

18:07.002 --> 18:08.087
What this?

18:08.545 --> 18:11.757
Oh, it's for the suns.
Grottans have sensitive eyes.

18:12.257 --> 18:13.092
Mm.

18:15.260 --> 18:16.970
-Mm?
-I can see you.

18:17.638 --> 18:20.474
-Ah, <i>bom!</i>

18:37.116 --> 18:39.368
What a mess!

18:39.451 --> 18:43.997
I should never have run away
and left you all alone.

18:44.081 --> 18:48.168
-You're just a young Gelfling girl.
-Stop. I don't need your terrible apology.

18:48.335 --> 18:51.380
I need answers.
I'm looking for this symbol.

18:51.547 --> 18:54.007
-I couldn't find it in any of the lore.
-Enough!

18:54.341 --> 18:57.219
I will not help you. Visions. Symbols.

18:57.302 --> 18:59.304
You sound like a Sifan.

18:59.388 --> 19:00.931
-Do I?
-I didn't mean that.

19:01.014 --> 19:05.102
Of course! The Sifa know more
about symbols than any of the clans.

19:05.185 --> 19:06.019
No!

19:06.103 --> 19:08.397
-The docks are no place for a princess.

19:09.022 --> 19:11.733
And Elder Cadia is not to be trusted.

19:12.276 --> 19:15.696
A name and where to find him.
Thank you for your help.

19:15.779 --> 19:18.532
There is always a price to pay
with the Sifa. Please!

19:18.615 --> 19:22.244
-I'm not afraid of the Sifa.
-You don't understand.

19:23.036 --> 19:25.205
The Sifa are not like the Vapra.

19:25.747 --> 19:29.251
I spent my early trine
sailing the Silver Sea with them.

19:29.960 --> 19:32.713
I was a foolish boy
searching for adventure.

19:33.547 --> 19:34.631
Did you find it?

19:35.424 --> 19:36.425
And more.

19:37.217 --> 19:38.468
Too much more.

19:40.512 --> 19:43.140
Well, I'll take my chances.

19:44.433 --> 19:46.185
With or without your help.

19:48.645 --> 19:50.147
Wait!

19:50.564 --> 19:51.732
I will help you.

20:10.375 --> 20:11.960
We shouldn't be here.

20:12.336 --> 20:14.338
- Princess.

20:14.463 --> 20:16.548
Elder Cadia has been waiting.

20:17.758 --> 20:20.761
How can Elder Cadia be waiting
if he didn't know we were coming?

20:20.844 --> 20:23.513
Because I am a soothsayer.

20:23.764 --> 20:25.224
Elder Cadia...

20:25.724 --> 20:27.184
it's an honor to meet you.

20:27.267 --> 20:30.270
I had the honor of an audience
with your mother once.

20:30.395 --> 20:32.272
You were a mere child then.

20:33.106 --> 20:34.983
But a Sifan does not forget...

20:35.859 --> 20:37.945
or forgive.

20:39.571 --> 20:42.574
Either he goes, or you both go.

20:42.658 --> 20:45.535
-But I--
- I-- I'll be on my way.

20:46.453 --> 20:47.871
No tricks, Cadia.

20:48.413 --> 20:49.539
Hmm...

20:51.208 --> 20:53.794
So, what can an old Sifan do for you?

20:54.670 --> 20:57.714
A potion, perhaps,
to make a Gelfling notice you

20:57.798 --> 20:59.800
or something to make your hair shine?

20:59.883 --> 21:01.343
My hair is fine.

21:02.386 --> 21:05.514
Do you know what this symbol means?

21:06.348 --> 21:08.350
-Hm!

21:10.852 --> 21:13.897
The answer to your question, Princess,

21:13.981 --> 21:16.400
cannot be found in this world.

21:16.483 --> 21:19.736
Perhaps it hides in the dream space.

21:21.321 --> 21:22.281
What's that?

21:23.407 --> 21:26.368
Onica, bring the powdered nulroot.

21:26.451 --> 21:28.370
-But, Elder--
-With speed!

21:28.745 --> 21:29.579
Yes.

21:30.539 --> 21:31.373
Hm.

21:31.456 --> 21:35.752
When Gelfling dreamfast,
we share our memories with one another.

21:35.877 --> 21:38.922
It is the dream space
that allows us to do this.

21:43.635 --> 21:47.014
The dream space binds us to Thra

21:47.222 --> 21:48.807
and to each other.

21:48.974 --> 21:51.018
It is the world within us all.

21:51.518 --> 21:52.728
How do I get there?

21:53.770 --> 21:54.604
Drink.

22:03.822 --> 22:04.698
Ah...

22:04.823 --> 22:06.283
You've forgotten something.

22:06.366 --> 22:07.659
Have I?

22:08.368 --> 22:09.453
Your payment.

22:10.037 --> 22:11.580
Sifa do nothing for free.

22:11.705 --> 22:12.914
Hmm...

22:15.709 --> 22:17.127
- Oh!
- Ka!

22:17.210 --> 22:20.213
-I'm sorry.
-For Ka's sake. No, fine, fine.

22:20.297 --> 22:22.132
Onica, lend me a hand here.

22:24.926 --> 22:25.927
Hm...

22:29.681 --> 22:30.599
There we are.

22:31.850 --> 22:34.478
Now... drink.

22:35.145 --> 22:37.898
-To the Crystal.
-To the Crystal.

22:37.981 --> 22:38.940
Hm.

22:47.783 --> 22:48.992
You're lying.

22:49.076 --> 22:50.202
Am I?

22:50.619 --> 22:53.497
I've read all about nulroot.
It doesn't make you dream.

22:53.580 --> 22:55.123
It makes you forget.

22:55.665 --> 22:58.627
Why do you want me
to forget this symbol, Elder?

22:59.002 --> 22:59.878
Hm.

23:00.921 --> 23:05.175
When a child goes looking for trouble,
they always, um...

23:05.967 --> 23:07.219
They always...

23:08.345 --> 23:09.638
What was I saying?

23:10.180 --> 23:11.014
You...

23:11.223 --> 23:12.599
You have a question for me?

23:13.392 --> 23:15.602
I want to know what this symbol means.

23:15.685 --> 23:17.437
Yes. That was it.

23:18.355 --> 23:20.899
No Gelfling can read your symbol.

23:20.982 --> 23:23.902
But when I see it, I sense...

23:24.319 --> 23:28.115
the end of all things.

23:30.867 --> 23:33.412
Did, um... Did you drink your tea yet?

23:34.246 --> 23:35.122
No.

23:35.705 --> 23:37.165
-You did.
-Huh?

23:41.211 --> 23:43.463
You switched our drinks?!

23:43.588 --> 23:46.007
I guess soothsayers can't see everything.

23:46.091 --> 23:48.760
-Foolish child!
-Let go of me!

23:49.010 --> 23:51.430
You must forget!
I'll make you forget! You just--

23:53.473 --> 23:55.600
She told you to let go.

23:55.684 --> 23:56.768
Bugger.

23:58.103 --> 23:58.937
Why...

23:59.604 --> 24:02.399
-Why did you--
-When Elder Cadia looks at your symbol,

24:02.482 --> 24:04.276
he only sees the end.

24:04.651 --> 24:07.487
But I see the chance for a new beginning.

24:07.904 --> 24:09.823
End - begin,

24:10.157 --> 24:11.825
death - life...

24:12.409 --> 24:14.035
it's all the same circle.

24:14.661 --> 24:16.163
-Death?
-Mm...

24:16.496 --> 24:18.081
I've seen the dark signs:

24:18.373 --> 24:22.544
strange storms,
sand where there used to be sea.

24:22.836 --> 24:25.505
-Thra is dying.

24:26.339 --> 24:28.842
Then... you'll help me?

24:29.176 --> 24:32.012
Bring me the brightest jewel
in your mother's chamber.

24:32.512 --> 24:35.474
Then you will get the answer you seek.

24:37.726 --> 24:40.395
-Very well, then.
- Return tomorrow night,

24:40.687 --> 24:43.857
when the last sister kisses the horizon.

24:44.316 --> 24:45.609
Don't be late.

24:46.151 --> 24:47.652
I sail with the tide.

24:50.197 --> 24:51.781
-Hello!

24:52.908 --> 24:54.701
-Hello?
-Hello.

24:54.784 --> 24:58.038
What's your name?
What's my name? Hello.

24:58.121 --> 24:59.080
Uh...

24:59.164 --> 25:02.417
It seems you've completely erased
Elder Cadia's memory.

25:02.542 --> 25:03.793
Hello.

25:03.877 --> 25:07.756
-Hello. Hello. Hello!
-I'm in so much trouble.

25:07.839 --> 25:10.342
Trouble?
I'm not in trouble. Maybe I am in trouble.

25:10.884 --> 25:12.761
Rian!

25:17.766 --> 25:21.937
What if the Gelfling beef
has escaped from the castle?

25:22.020 --> 25:24.147
Oh, then we are undone.

25:26.024 --> 25:29.152
-Best not to dwell on such dark thoughts.
-Yes.

25:30.529 --> 25:33.698
-Come out, Rian.
- Gelfling!

25:33.949 --> 25:36.409
We won't hurt you...

25:36.660 --> 25:38.370
for long.

25:38.787 --> 25:41.414
<i>-</i>Rian?
-You were right about one thing.

25:42.123 --> 25:44.668
-I don't like this plan at all.
-Mm...

25:49.089 --> 25:51.841
The only way Maudra Fara
will believe us is if we bring proof.

25:51.925 --> 25:54.636
She has to believe you.
She's the maudra of your clan.

25:54.719 --> 25:56.846
I mean, you could just dreamfast with her.

25:57.430 --> 25:59.474
No. I'm a wanted fugitive.

25:59.766 --> 26:01.601
If something happens to me, then...

26:02.644 --> 26:04.396
Then the truth dies with you.

26:04.688 --> 26:06.189
I can't pass on your memories.

26:07.107 --> 26:08.775
That's why we're going
to bring Maudra Fara

26:08.858 --> 26:10.360
proof of the Skeksis' crimes:

26:10.819 --> 26:12.320
Mira's essence.

26:17.492 --> 26:19.995
-Is that...
- The Crystal of Truth.

26:34.509 --> 26:35.594
But it's cracked.

26:37.178 --> 26:39.931
-And is it supposed to be that color?
-No.

26:40.932 --> 26:42.601
The Skeksis have corrupted it.

26:44.644 --> 26:45.895
Poor Crystal.

26:46.813 --> 26:49.149
-So, what do we do now?
-Now?

26:50.025 --> 26:51.192
We climb down.

26:52.444 --> 26:53.987
Climb... down.

26:54.946 --> 26:56.323
Oh.

26:58.908 --> 27:02.537
Impatient and ignorant,
that's what they are.

27:02.621 --> 27:06.583
Genius cannot be rushed.

27:17.969 --> 27:22.182
Locksnake should keep inquisitive hands
to themselves.

27:40.408 --> 27:41.242
It's clear.

27:41.326 --> 27:43.745
-Look at this place.
-We have to be fast.

27:44.579 --> 27:46.414
The essence is in the cabinet over there.

27:57.175 --> 27:59.469
-What do you think this thing does?

27:59.552 --> 28:01.429
Don't touch anything!

28:04.432 --> 28:06.267
Uh...

28:06.393 --> 28:07.894
-Problem.
-What?

28:19.823 --> 28:20.657
Hide!

28:32.043 --> 28:33.545
Mm...

28:34.170 --> 28:35.422
Ah...

28:36.631 --> 28:38.007
Mm...

28:40.301 --> 28:41.344
Mm?

28:44.055 --> 28:47.308
Sneaky locksnake! Yes.

28:47.809 --> 28:49.853
-Mmm...

28:51.229 --> 28:52.856
Yes.

28:53.606 --> 28:57.402
Sleepy... sleepy...

29:00.905 --> 29:02.657
Mmm...
Ah!

29:09.831 --> 29:11.374
Mmm...

29:13.293 --> 29:16.629
And just a taste.

29:17.589 --> 29:19.048
Chamberlain!

29:20.300 --> 29:24.429
-Scientist.
-Explain this nefarious intrusion.

29:25.054 --> 29:27.182
I... I came looking for you.

29:27.265 --> 29:30.685
-Hmm... Is that correct?
-Yes!

29:30.769 --> 29:36.024
The Emperor sent me to retrieve
update on broken machine, yes?

29:36.149 --> 29:39.527
-More essence yet?
-Will be soon.

29:39.611 --> 29:41.488
Very soon.

29:41.571 --> 29:45.742
This is good, yes.
Emperor will be most pleased.

29:45.909 --> 29:48.119
-I go now. Bye-bye.
-Wait!

29:49.496 --> 29:51.664
-Yes?

29:52.123 --> 29:53.917
I smell Gelfling.

29:59.339 --> 30:02.258
-Stonewood.
-Ah, Rian.

30:08.431 --> 30:09.599
Drenchen.

30:09.682 --> 30:11.726
Yes, strong.

30:11.851 --> 30:13.394
Eh...

30:14.229 --> 30:15.605
-Hm?

30:17.774 --> 30:20.068
-What's this?
-Hmmm?

30:20.401 --> 30:22.654
-Thief!
-Who is thief?

30:22.779 --> 30:24.280
You pilfered the vial!

30:24.364 --> 30:25.573
Not I.

30:25.740 --> 30:28.952
-Must have been Gelfling.
-I might have believed you

30:29.035 --> 30:31.913
if not for the locksnake bits
in your teeth.

30:33.915 --> 30:35.708
This is all a mistake, yes?

30:35.792 --> 30:38.461
Simple misunderstanding.

30:39.754 --> 30:41.256
-Ah!

30:41.422 --> 30:44.384
-Explain yourself, skekSil!
-No!

30:46.886 --> 30:49.681
-Villain!
-Spineless jelly.

30:51.683 --> 30:54.060
I am not afraid of you!

30:55.895 --> 30:58.648
What if I slice off that forked tongue?

31:02.735 --> 31:04.904
-Follow me!

31:07.490 --> 31:08.449
Don't stop now!

31:08.783 --> 31:10.910
-The vial!
-They're absconding with the essence!

31:11.661 --> 31:14.080
-We must catch Gelfling!
-Gelfling!

31:14.706 --> 31:16.457
-I think we lost them.

31:17.208 --> 31:19.919
We'll celebrate when we're out
of the castle. Come on!

31:25.216 --> 31:27.886
Vermin Gelfling!

31:32.891 --> 31:33.892
Mine!

31:34.642 --> 31:36.269
-No! Gurjin!

31:36.644 --> 31:40.356
Easy, Gelfling.
This is all misunderstanding.

31:42.191 --> 31:44.193
We are friends, Rian.

31:44.277 --> 31:45.820
No, don't listen, Rian.

31:46.613 --> 31:50.199
Please, already things go too far.

31:50.325 --> 31:52.535
It cannot end well.

31:52.619 --> 31:54.454
Give essence back, please.

31:56.164 --> 31:57.540
Please!

31:58.666 --> 32:00.919
Do not be foolish.

32:07.258 --> 32:08.927
Now!

32:11.095 --> 32:13.097
- Run, Rian!
-Foul sneak!

32:15.141 --> 32:18.269
- It's escaping!
- Don't stop!

32:43.586 --> 32:46.673
-Lamentable!
-You'll never catch Rian now.

32:47.090 --> 32:48.299
Hmm...

32:48.466 --> 32:51.177
We shall see.

32:56.099 --> 32:57.809
The caves are deep underground,

32:57.892 --> 33:00.770
and that's why I have to wear a blindfold
when the suns shine bright.

33:00.853 --> 33:01.688
Oh.

33:01.771 --> 33:03.940
I don't know how the other clans
go about their lives

33:04.023 --> 33:06.442
with three suns
hanging over their heads all the time.

33:06.526 --> 33:08.361
They're giant balls of fire.

33:08.945 --> 33:10.530
What if one falls?

33:10.655 --> 33:11.531
Oh...

33:13.825 --> 33:15.159
What? Hup?

33:16.953 --> 33:17.787
Hup!

33:19.747 --> 33:22.125
Where are you going? Ha'rar is this way.

33:22.542 --> 33:26.671
No, no, no, no.
This way, yeah, go to Ha'rar.

33:27.088 --> 33:29.340
But Maudra Argot told me,

33:29.424 --> 33:32.010
“Follow the brightest star to Ha'rar.”

33:32.552 --> 33:34.512
Ah...

33:36.389 --> 33:39.142
-<i>Yotsa. </i>Bright moon.
-Huh?

33:39.976 --> 33:42.228
<i>Otsa. </i>Bright star.

33:44.897 --> 33:46.649
I was going the wrong way.

33:46.774 --> 33:48.735
Little wrong.

33:48.860 --> 33:50.987
Thank you, wise Paladin.

33:51.404 --> 33:52.321
-Oh!

33:54.198 --> 33:55.283
Oh...

34:04.042 --> 34:07.420
The Sifa tell me you drugged Elder Cadia.

34:07.503 --> 34:10.965
He tried to drug me first.
He tried to erase my memory.

34:12.008 --> 34:12.884
Tavra,

34:13.301 --> 34:16.429
attend to the Sifan caravan.
I will join you shortly.

34:16.637 --> 34:18.139
As you wish, Mother.

34:20.308 --> 34:21.350
Be strong.

34:24.062 --> 34:26.064
Brea, what will I do with you?

34:26.147 --> 34:28.566
It's Elder Cadia you should be talking to.

34:28.649 --> 34:29.776
We can't.

34:30.234 --> 34:31.861
He doesn't remember anything,

34:31.944 --> 34:33.488
-thanks to you.
-Enough!

34:36.324 --> 34:40.119
The Sifa are not a forgiving clan.
They will demand justice.

34:40.870 --> 34:41.704
But...

34:42.038 --> 34:43.456
But I'm your daughter.

34:44.415 --> 34:47.418
Even a princess is not above the law.

34:48.002 --> 34:51.089
Perhaps Brea may benefit from some time

34:51.172 --> 34:55.051
spent performing good deeds
for the most downtrodden with the...

34:56.094 --> 34:58.721
-Order of Lesser Service.

34:59.263 --> 35:02.975
Mother! Please, you can't send me away!
There's something I have to do!

35:03.059 --> 35:05.061
Brea, you've done enough already.

35:05.311 --> 35:07.814
Sneaking out, wiping memories...

35:08.564 --> 35:11.275
stealing necklaces.

35:13.194 --> 35:15.822
-Mother, I--
-Report to the Order of Lesser Service

35:15.905 --> 35:17.865
at first light. That is all.

35:17.990 --> 35:21.452
-No, but I can't--
-That... is all.

35:23.830 --> 35:24.872
Yes, Mother.

35:26.040 --> 35:26.916
Hmph.

35:45.393 --> 35:48.479
- Ugh, waste of time.
- Yes.

35:48.563 --> 35:54.110
I found the Gelflings' offerings
sadly lacking.

35:54.443 --> 35:58.197
Several whined of a strange blight
upon their lands.

35:58.406 --> 36:00.575
-Gelfling are full of excuses.

36:01.617 --> 36:03.744
Bring the tithes
to the Collector's chambers.

36:03.828 --> 36:04.704
Quickly now.

36:06.622 --> 36:07.915
-Captain.

36:07.999 --> 36:11.043
-Is there a problem?
-It's your son. Rian.

36:11.210 --> 36:12.420
Oh...

36:25.141 --> 36:27.977
You say that Gelflings stole the vial?

36:28.060 --> 36:30.730
It was all the Chamberlain's fault.

36:30.813 --> 36:34.150
Well, why am I not surprised?

36:34.525 --> 36:37.778
We must make a bloody example
of these treacherous Gelfling.

36:38.362 --> 36:40.156
-And of the Chamberlain.

36:42.033 --> 36:44.869
What else could possibly go wrong?

36:49.540 --> 36:51.292
Welcome, skekSil.

36:53.920 --> 36:55.838
Calamity has befallen.

36:55.922 --> 36:59.759
Rian has escaped
with proof of our dark deeds.

37:00.092 --> 37:03.179
The Scientist has placed the blame
upon your head.

37:05.723 --> 37:07.058
Hmm...

37:07.225 --> 37:09.143
Scientist speaks true.

37:09.810 --> 37:12.396
-Chamberlain is to blame.

37:12.772 --> 37:15.524
I knew it! I knew it!

37:15.775 --> 37:17.818
Chamberlain must be punished.

37:17.902 --> 37:19.820
I deserve to be punished.

37:19.946 --> 37:22.114
Flog me. Scold me.

37:22.198 --> 37:24.200
I am riddled with shame.

37:24.367 --> 37:25.868
Such shame.

37:26.327 --> 37:29.080
If only I had arrived in lab sooner.

37:29.747 --> 37:32.333
By time I got there, too late!

37:32.416 --> 37:34.502
Filthy Gelfling stolen vial.

37:36.587 --> 37:38.422
Prevaricator! Liar!

37:38.589 --> 37:41.259
It was you who took the vial
from my cabinet.

37:41.342 --> 37:43.177
-I tried to protect vial...
-Bah!

37:43.261 --> 37:45.137
...but Scientist attacked me!

37:45.221 --> 37:47.139
Knocked vial from my grasp.

37:47.515 --> 37:50.393
It was then
that stinking Gelfling snatched it up.

37:50.768 --> 37:52.478
Is this true, Scientist?

37:53.646 --> 37:56.274
-Technically.
-I tried to stop them.

37:56.565 --> 37:59.318
Caught the slimy Drenchen Gelfling.
He stabbed me.

37:59.568 --> 38:01.445
Oh, the pain!

38:01.654 --> 38:04.448
-But I held on. Put him in chains.

38:04.865 --> 38:06.534
-Unlike Scientist...
-Huh?

38:06.617 --> 38:08.744
...who allowed Rian
to escape with essence.

38:09.954 --> 38:12.206
The vial was clearly
the Scientist's responsibility.

38:12.331 --> 38:15.543
-But, Emperor...
-He must be punished!

38:16.085 --> 38:18.921
-Oh, dangle the tail! Dangle the tail!

38:19.005 --> 38:20.881
-Yes! Strap him to the Needler!
-No!

38:20.965 --> 38:24.719
The Scientist's errors
require a more permanent discipline.

38:25.428 --> 38:27.638
-You speak truth, Emperor.

38:27.722 --> 38:31.517
But Scientist is still Skeksis, yes?

38:31.600 --> 38:34.437
Perhaps Scientist
would most benefit seeing...

38:35.021 --> 38:37.189
-peeper beetle.

38:37.315 --> 38:38.733
What an excellent suggestion.

38:38.858 --> 38:42.737
My most adored
of the Five Ocular Castigation.

38:42.820 --> 38:45.156
- It has been many a trine...

38:45.239 --> 38:48.701
...since any saw the peeper beetle.

38:50.870 --> 38:54.582
Please, Emperor, not that! <i> </i>I beseech you!

38:54.665 --> 38:56.667
Prepare the Scientist.

38:58.961 --> 39:00.671
-Ah...
-No! Please!<i> </i>

39:01.505 --> 39:02.965
- Come now.
-No!

39:03.049 --> 39:04.675
- Come.
- Please!

39:04.759 --> 39:07.345
No!

39:09.722 --> 39:11.265
Mmm...

39:11.390 --> 39:12.516
Shame.

39:12.725 --> 39:14.894
Such shame.

39:14.977 --> 39:15.895
Mm...

39:17.605 --> 39:19.607
Out of my spot.

39:22.276 --> 39:24.111
Yes! A fight!

39:25.988 --> 39:27.907
-My lords.
- Huh?

39:28.491 --> 39:30.451
I request an audience.

39:30.534 --> 39:33.454
How dare you request anything
of your Emperor?

39:34.872 --> 39:35.831
Mmm...

39:35.956 --> 39:36.916
Ah, sire.

39:37.500 --> 39:40.378
Ordon is traitor Rian's father.

39:40.461 --> 39:41.337
Ah...

39:41.962 --> 39:42.838
Let him speak.

39:44.090 --> 39:47.009
As you command, sire.

39:48.260 --> 39:50.971
I come to beg mercy for my son, Rian.

39:51.055 --> 39:53.182
No mercy for murderers!

39:53.307 --> 39:54.683
He is no murderer!

39:54.809 --> 39:56.977
The Drenchen
has already confessed to everything.

39:58.354 --> 40:00.064
-Gurjin?
- Yes!

40:00.147 --> 40:04.026
This Gurjin conspired with son Rian
to steal from us.

40:04.110 --> 40:06.654
-Mm-hmm.
- When Mira discovered plan,

40:06.737 --> 40:08.656
they killed her and tried to flee.

40:09.198 --> 40:13.202
Is lucky for all
I was able to capture Gurjin.

40:14.745 --> 40:18.374
Mighty Emperor,
give me leave to go after my son.

40:18.582 --> 40:19.792
Once I find him,

40:19.875 --> 40:22.128
-we can dreamfast.
-No!

40:22.211 --> 40:25.923
No! You must not dreamfast with Rian.

40:26.340 --> 40:28.843
We believe his mind is infected.

40:28.968 --> 40:30.344
It might spread.

40:30.886 --> 40:33.097
He is sick, yes?

40:33.180 --> 40:35.891
Yes! That would explain his actions.

40:36.225 --> 40:37.435
He is not well.

40:38.561 --> 40:40.438
-Can you heal him?<i></i>

40:40.521 --> 40:44.942
Please, surely the Lords of the Crystal
can make my son whole again.

40:47.820 --> 40:48.863
Mmm...

40:50.072 --> 40:51.866
-Sire...
-Mm-hmm...

40:52.491 --> 40:54.452
-Hmm...

40:55.911 --> 40:57.872
-Mm-hmm.
-Mmm...

40:58.456 --> 40:59.290
Go.

40:59.999 --> 41:01.083
Find Rian.

41:01.459 --> 41:05.713
Bring him and the treasure
he stole from us back to the castle.

41:06.297 --> 41:11.135
Then, by the power of the Crystal,
we will heal your son.

41:12.261 --> 41:13.429
Thank you, Emperor.

41:13.929 --> 41:14.889
Thank you.

41:16.432 --> 41:21.729
Why do we play these ridiculous games?
We are wasting precious time, Chamberlain.

41:21.812 --> 41:23.272
Nonsense.

41:23.355 --> 41:25.649
Who knows a son
better than his own father?

41:27.026 --> 41:30.321
He will bring us the vial and the traitor.

41:30.654 --> 41:32.990
And we will drain them both!

41:33.324 --> 41:36.076
-Then, essence for all!

41:37.870 --> 41:39.997
Essence for all!

41:49.006 --> 41:50.549
Essence!

41:50.674 --> 41:52.510
-Essence! Essence!

41:53.010 --> 41:54.803
Essence! Essence!

42:02.853 --> 42:04.563
No help! No, no, no, no!

42:08.400 --> 42:09.401
Useless!

42:09.985 --> 42:10.945
This one.

42:16.200 --> 42:17.618
No! No, no, no.

42:24.500 --> 42:26.794
One trine, look...

42:29.505 --> 42:32.091
What? Aughra has no time to eat!

42:32.591 --> 42:33.551
-Huh?

42:33.717 --> 42:37.805
Searched books of prophecy,
scrolls of divination - nothing!

42:38.138 --> 42:40.683
Still have not found the reason
Thra cried out!

42:42.309 --> 42:44.228
Up! Up!

42:44.979 --> 42:46.313
Stop squirming!

42:49.441 --> 42:52.736
I must find what has happened
in my absence.

42:53.237 --> 42:54.071
I could...

42:54.154 --> 42:55.531
I could ask the Mystics.

42:55.739 --> 42:58.284
No, no, no, no.
No time for riddles.

42:59.118 --> 43:00.369
Hm...

43:01.829 --> 43:06.417
The Skeksis promised to keep Crystal safe
while I journeyed the stars.

43:09.461 --> 43:11.463
They must have the answers I seek.

43:54.673 --> 43:56.342
No! No!

43:58.510 --> 43:59.887
Fetch the cage.

44:04.350 --> 44:06.352
Oh, mercy!

44:07.686 --> 44:09.772
Cage!

44:10.814 --> 44:13.192
No!

44:32.878 --> 44:35.339
When we fail ourselves...

44:35.422 --> 44:38.175
...we must be punished.

44:39.635 --> 44:42.012
When we fail each other...

44:42.471 --> 44:45.766
...we must be punished.

44:48.310 --> 44:51.438
When we fail our Emperor...

44:51.563 --> 44:55.234
...we must be punished.

44:56.402 --> 44:58.862
Mercy! Mercy!

44:59.988 --> 45:02.825
Mercy! Mercy! Mercy!

45:16.422 --> 45:17.756
Mmm...

45:21.760 --> 45:24.555
It will all be over soon.
