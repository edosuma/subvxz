00:00.055 --> 00:03.923
You can't just turn five helplessly
stranded little girls out into the night.

00:03.985 --> 00:06.920
- Bah, humbug.
- Higgins!

00:06.988 --> 00:09.252
Don't touch it! It's a
very sensitive alarm!

00:12.127 --> 00:15.893
- There is just no limit to their imaginations.
- There's a girl here to see you.

00:15.964 --> 00:19.559
If she's under 16,
I don't wanna know.

00:19.634 --> 00:22.068
Magnum!

00:22.137 --> 00:25.129
- We gave you some really rotten leads.
- If you'd given him a decent lead,

00:25.206 --> 00:27.766
he would've have blown it higher
than a Chinese firecracker.

00:27.842 --> 00:31.141
- Come on, buddy. This is serious.
- I said they ain't here.

00:31.212 --> 00:34.670
But if they do come in, I'll be sure
to tell them you had to leave.

00:34.749 --> 00:38.685
Where'd we park the car?
I don't know. I'm following you.

00:38.753 --> 00:40.687
Higgins and I do this all the time.

00:40.755 --> 00:43.349
It's sort of a game. A game?

00:43.424 --> 00:45.324
My girls are kidnapped.!
They might die.!

00:49.564 --> 00:53.523
- Five little girls are going to die
unless I deliver that Gauguin. - Who's he?

00:53.601 --> 00:55.865
Ask T.C.
Oh, no. Don't ask me nothing.

00:55.937 --> 00:59.168
- I can explain this whole
misunderstanding. - No, you can't.

02:55.657 --> 02:57.921
Aah!

02:57.992 --> 03:01.325
Higgins.!

03:02.330 --> 03:05.527
Higgins.! Higgins.!

03:06.701 --> 03:10.228
Higgins.! Higgins.!

03:13.841 --> 03:15.832
Higgins.!

03:16.978 --> 03:20.345
What are they doing
in the wine cellar?

03:21.549 --> 03:24.575
Obviously, protecting the wine
from intruders.

03:24.652 --> 03:26.745
I am not an intruder.
I'm a guest.

03:26.821 --> 03:29.381
Guests eventually leave.
Until I do...

03:29.457 --> 03:34.292
You will settle
for the vintages I select.

03:37.031 --> 03:38.965
October?

03:41.903 --> 03:45.532
Higgins, the wine cellar is one of
the few places left on the estate,

03:45.606 --> 03:48.268
besides the bathroom,
that I can go without fear of my life.

03:48.343 --> 03:53.371
An oversight on my part, now rectified
by my upgraded level of security.

03:53.448 --> 03:56.906
Upgraded level of security
to keep me out of the wine cellar?

03:56.984 --> 03:59.509
Well, there is Mr. Masters's
latest acquisition.

03:59.587 --> 04:02.715
What? The Christmas tree?

04:06.094 --> 04:09.996
Higgins, that's a Gauguin. Yes.

04:10.064 --> 04:14.160
Perhaps there's hope for you after all.

04:14.235 --> 04:17.067
What's it worth? Two million.

04:17.137 --> 04:19.072
Dollars or pounds?

04:19.140 --> 04:22.041
Marks. Yes, Mr. Masters.

04:22.110 --> 04:26.206
Uh, this is Chan's Laundry.
Is Mr. Magnum there, please?

04:27.448 --> 04:32.317
Mr. Masters's private number
is not to be given out to tradesmen.

04:32.387 --> 04:34.787
- Hello?
- Thomas, it's Rick.

04:34.856 --> 04:36.790
If Higgins finds out I got this number,
he's gonna freak out.

04:36.858 --> 04:39.258
- I told him I was your laundryman.
- My what?

04:39.327 --> 04:42.854
Never mind. Just listen. A female called
on your line, and she wants to hire you.

04:42.930 --> 04:47.162
Uh, no, no. That's heavy starch on
the shirts and light on the shorts.

04:47.235 --> 04:49.669
That's really cute. Now look.

04:49.737 --> 04:52.900
Be at the state capitol building
by 3:00, and she'll approach you.

04:52.974 --> 04:54.965
Now wait...

04:57.945 --> 05:00.379
You starch your undershorts?

05:01.783 --> 05:03.774
Doesn't everybody?

05:23.971 --> 05:26.303
I pride myself on being able
to pick out clients,

05:26.374 --> 05:28.740
but this time I was stumped.

05:28.810 --> 05:32.109
All I saw were camera-loaded tourists
taking dozens of pictures...

05:32.180 --> 05:34.580
of the same thing.

05:51.165 --> 05:53.326
Hi.

05:54.502 --> 05:57.562
You with that group over there?

05:58.673 --> 06:02.165
It's really funny. They must have
taken 50 pictures of that statue.

06:02.243 --> 06:06.680
Fifty pictures... Hi.

06:09.150 --> 06:12.278
This is only the second time
I've been here.

06:16.724 --> 06:19.625
- Are you girls waiting for someone?
- Thomas Magnum?

06:19.694 --> 06:23.255
- Yeah. - Good. We were
afraid you might not show.

06:23.331 --> 06:26.664
You're the ones who want to hire
a private investigator?

06:30.071 --> 06:34.940
Look, if you're worried about getting paid for
this gig, it's okay. We've taken care of all that.

06:35.009 --> 06:37.273
He'll never be able to do it.
Do what?

06:37.345 --> 06:39.711
- Find her.
- Find who?

06:39.780 --> 06:43.773
- This is a drag. - No, wait. I just
don't know what you're talking about.

06:43.851 --> 06:47.810
We're here from Vermont for the
holidays, and we lost our teacher.

06:47.889 --> 06:49.823
You lost your teacher?

06:49.891 --> 06:52.382
I told you he'd
never be able to do it.

06:58.032 --> 07:00.330
I hate for the younger ones
to know about this.

07:00.401 --> 07:03.495
- They're so impressionable, you know?
- Yeah, right.

07:03.571 --> 07:05.562
Our teacher is a real...

07:06.741 --> 07:09.005
Well, she kind of falls in love easy.

07:09.076 --> 07:12.637
It doesn't take her long to choose
from the menu, if you get my drift.

07:12.713 --> 07:16.843
- I get your drift.
- Quit whispering, Nancy.

07:16.918 --> 07:18.852
We all know
what you're talking about.

07:18.920 --> 07:21.787
Miss Booton got the hots for some beach
bum and split with him for an overnight.

07:21.856 --> 07:24.017
Lesli. You're telling me...

07:24.091 --> 07:26.025
your teacher
who brought you here...

07:26.093 --> 07:28.721
went off with some stranger,
and left you little kids stranded?

07:28.796 --> 07:32.254
Not really. She said she'd
be back tomorrow night.

07:32.333 --> 07:34.392
But our headmaster phoned,
and he's coming in...

07:34.468 --> 07:37.369
tomorrow morning at 9:00
to spend Christmas with us.

07:37.438 --> 07:40.066
We have to find her
before he gets here.

07:40.141 --> 07:42.371
Or she'll be in big trouble.

07:42.443 --> 07:44.934
Well, she should be in big trouble!

07:45.012 --> 07:48.140
She shouldn't be punished
for her passion.

07:49.150 --> 07:53.086
We'll stay with you
till you find Miss Booton.

07:53.154 --> 07:56.419
- Stay with me?
- We checked out of our hotel.

07:56.490 --> 07:58.958
We're paying you
with the deposit refund.

07:59.026 --> 08:01.859
Yeah, but I didn't even decide
to take the case yet.

08:01.929 --> 08:04.830
Come on, Nancy.
He won't be able to do anything.

08:04.899 --> 08:09.029
You don't even know where your
teacher went. It could take days.

08:09.103 --> 08:13.130
I'd like to help you guys out,
but I don't know...

08:17.745 --> 08:21.272
Well, it is Christmas.

08:22.984 --> 08:27.785
Never! This estate
is for Robin Masters's guests,

08:27.855 --> 08:30.085
not your... clients.

08:31.726 --> 08:34.251
Higgins, it's just for tonight.
I promise...

08:34.328 --> 08:36.727
I'll have them out in the morning,
as soon as I find their teacher.

08:36.797 --> 08:40.028
- No.
- Come on, Higgins. It's the holidays.

08:40.101 --> 08:42.227
It's a time for giving and sharing.
Right, kids?

08:42.303 --> 08:47.104
You can't just turn five helplessly
stranded little girls out into the night.

08:47.174 --> 08:50.234
- Bah, humbug.
- Higgins.

08:50.311 --> 08:53.405
- The wine cellar.
- The wine cellar?

08:53.481 --> 08:58.077
- I don't want you in it. - October
wasn't my favorite vintage anyway.

08:58.152 --> 09:02.919
- And I want them out of here first
thing in the morning. - Of course.

09:02.990 --> 09:04.981
All right!

09:08.796 --> 09:11.629
Can I still use the kitchen?
For now.

09:11.699 --> 09:14.099
Thank you very much.
You're quite welcome.

09:17.038 --> 09:19.973
Is Magnum married, Huggins?

09:21.308 --> 09:23.299
It's Higgins.

09:29.984 --> 09:32.885
All I had for clues
was the lady's overnight case,

09:32.953 --> 09:35.319
a couple of phone numbers
the girls had found in her room...

09:35.389 --> 09:39.519
and a very rough description
of the guy she went off with.

09:39.593 --> 09:43.529
I had a long night ahead of me,
but, then, so did Higgins.

09:43.597 --> 09:45.895
As long as you're staying here,

09:45.966 --> 09:49.902
there are certain rules
and regulations to obey.

09:49.970 --> 09:53.371
First, you will be restricted
to the second floor guest quarters.

09:53.441 --> 09:57.275
Unless, of course,
you need to use the lavatory facilities.

09:57.344 --> 09:59.505
Those are located
at the end of the hall.

09:59.580 --> 10:01.844
Higgins, who painted this?
Gauguin. Don't touch it!

10:01.916 --> 10:04.248
There's a very sensitive...

10:04.318 --> 10:06.752
alarm!

10:08.956 --> 10:11.516
I'm sorry. I just wanted
to feel the brushstrokes.

10:11.592 --> 10:14.060
Don't ever touch
that painting again, ever.

10:14.128 --> 10:16.221
Don't even go near it.

10:19.233 --> 10:23.602
Zeus, Apollo, what's wrong, lads?

10:25.406 --> 10:27.397
Something's stuck
in their mouths.

10:30.611 --> 10:32.579
Darlene probably fed them gumdrops.

10:32.646 --> 10:34.637
That's usually what does it.

10:35.950 --> 10:37.884
Gumdrops?

10:37.952 --> 10:39.886
I told you not to touch that!

10:39.954 --> 10:42.388
It's crooked.
I was just trying to straighten it.

10:42.456 --> 10:45.516
I don't care if it's upside down.
It's not to be touched.

10:45.593 --> 10:48.960
Nothing on this estate is to be touched.
Is that understood? Nothing!

10:49.029 --> 10:51.020
Okay, okay.

10:51.098 --> 10:54.431
- Lighten up, will you, Huggins?
- Higgins.

11:12.253 --> 11:14.813
We may have some trouble
with that little guy.

11:14.889 --> 11:17.414
Nah, he'll be okay.

11:17.491 --> 11:20.358
We got him so riled up
that he'll probably be exhausted.

11:20.427 --> 11:24.022
And that means he'll sleep well.
What have we got?

11:24.098 --> 11:28.125
The only alarm is a sensitivity
mechanism in the back of the painting.

11:28.202 --> 11:30.534
The switch is on the right-hand wall,
behind the drapes.

11:30.604 --> 11:33.971
What about the dogs? Good.

11:41.315 --> 11:43.783
Mother Goose,
this is Rubber Duck.

11:43.851 --> 11:45.785
We're in the nest.

11:45.853 --> 11:49.084
There's one alarm.
We've located the switch.

11:50.291 --> 11:52.282
Got it.

11:55.329 --> 11:59.197
I still can't believe
the voice on the phone was a kid.

11:59.266 --> 12:03.134
That must have been Melissa.
She's very grown up for her age.

12:04.338 --> 12:09.332
"" St. Helen's Preparatory School
for Girls. Fall Directory."

12:09.410 --> 12:11.742
These are your clients? Yep.

12:11.812 --> 12:14.906
Uh, that's the one right there
who gave me all these numbers.

12:14.982 --> 12:18.782
"Nancy Semko, class of 1982."

12:18.853 --> 12:21.981
Hey, Thomas, they've got some pretty
heavyweight students enrolled in here.

12:22.056 --> 12:24.547
It says here that Nancy's pop
is the head of Bunker Industries.

12:24.625 --> 12:29.460
Yeah, I know. I think I'm gonna
have to run down this address.

12:32.399 --> 12:34.333
This isn't exactly
the high-rent district.

12:34.401 --> 12:37.165
If you go down there, I suggest you
bring a gun or an alligator on a leash.

12:37.238 --> 12:41.698
Rick, I am looking for a
schoolteacher, not a gorilla. Mm-hmm.

12:41.775 --> 12:44.335
I know that, you know that,
but they don't know that down there.

12:44.411 --> 12:48.780
So I'll tell them.
Hi, T.C. Wanna go to dinner?

12:51.619 --> 12:53.917
Man, you said ""dinner."
You didn't say the ""Last Supper."

12:53.988 --> 12:56.115
We're not gonna eat here.
I'm gonna take you someplace nice.

12:56.190 --> 12:58.886
If we ain't gonna eat here,
what the hell we doing here?

12:59.994 --> 13:02.622
I know what it is. It's another one
of your crazy cases, isn't it?

13:02.696 --> 13:05.597
No, it isn't.
Hey, look, don't forget...

13:05.666 --> 13:07.998
You called me.
I didn't call you.

13:08.068 --> 13:11.060
T.C., it is nothing dangerous,
believe me.

13:16.644 --> 13:18.635
Of all the classy restaurants
in Honolulu,

13:18.712 --> 13:20.771
you drag me down here
to a joint like this.

13:20.848 --> 13:24.340
Will you just bear with me?
I am trying to find someone.

13:25.586 --> 13:28.020
Hi there.
I wonder if you can help me.

13:29.490 --> 13:32.482
Beer or whiskey? Actually we
don't want anything to drink.

13:32.559 --> 13:34.789
Except, maybe, a couple beers.

13:39.099 --> 13:41.829
I'm looking for a short,
blonde lady, about 28.

13:41.902 --> 13:45.099
She was with a husky Hawaiian,
beachcomber type.

13:45.172 --> 13:47.663
That'll be five dollars.

13:50.210 --> 13:54.510
- For the beer or the information?
- Don't sound too familiar.

13:57.985 --> 13:59.976
Would another beer
make it sound more familiar?

14:00.054 --> 14:03.285
Sorry, buddy. No one like her has
been in here with a guy like that.

14:03.357 --> 14:07.794
Now, wait a minute.
What about this, uh... this address?

14:12.232 --> 14:14.666
That's Mano's place, upstairs.

14:15.736 --> 14:17.670
I don't think you're gonna
find a lady in there.

14:17.738 --> 14:21.071
Yeah. Well, thanks anyway...

14:22.710 --> 14:24.701
for the beer.

14:42.196 --> 14:44.357
Yeah?

14:44.431 --> 14:47.093
Nah, he ain't here tonight.
He's out with Roxanne.

14:47.167 --> 14:49.533
Why? What's up?

14:49.603 --> 14:51.696
Oh, yeah?
When did they leave your place?

14:52.840 --> 14:54.899
I think they just
came through the door.

14:56.210 --> 14:58.337
This is Saigon Suzie's, man.
No, it isn't.

14:58.412 --> 15:00.972
- Oh, yes, it is.
- Thanks for the tip.

15:02.282 --> 15:05.274
This place doesn't even have a jukebox.
Come on.

15:15.329 --> 15:18.492
Excuse me. Excuse me.
I'm trying to find someone.

15:18.565 --> 15:20.624
They ain't here.
I didn't ask you who yet.

15:20.701 --> 15:22.566
I don't care. They ain't here.

15:22.636 --> 15:27.096
This is a short, blonde lady with a
Hawaiian, kind of a lifeguard type.

15:27.174 --> 15:29.904
- Saigon Suzie's.
- Look, I said they ain't here.

15:29.977 --> 15:34.914
But if they do come in, I'll be sure to
tell them you had to leave... abruptly.

15:34.982 --> 15:37.610
Come on, buddy. This is serious.

15:37.684 --> 15:40.676
I mean, somebody's life could
be in dan... Will you stop that?

15:40.754 --> 15:42.745
I am trying to tell this man...

15:44.291 --> 15:46.725
Saigon Suzie's? Mm-hmm.

15:49.897 --> 15:53.560
Hey, fellas,
we didn't mean any offense.

15:55.035 --> 15:57.060
Come on, buddy. Come on...

16:01.675 --> 16:04.576
Where'd we park the car?
I don't know! I'm following you!

16:04.645 --> 16:06.636
Oh!

16:08.816 --> 16:10.816
You don't remember where you
parked the car, do you?

16:10.818 --> 16:13.685
Of course I remember where
I parked the car. Mm-hmm.

16:14.755 --> 16:16.245
See?

16:24.431 --> 16:27.264
Come on. Let's get this thing going.
They'll never catch us in this.

16:27.334 --> 16:29.461
I can't start the car
till I clear the alarm.

16:29.536 --> 16:33.370
Why'd you set the alarm? Why'd I
set the alarm? Look around you.

16:33.440 --> 16:37.376
Hey, Mano, two guys just blew
through here. They tore this place apart.

16:37.444 --> 16:41.881
I'm pretty sure they're private heat.
They had that look, you know?

16:41.949 --> 16:45.009
He said he was looking for a Hawaiian
hanging out with a blonde chick.

16:45.085 --> 16:48.350
Sounds a lot like your new prize.

16:48.422 --> 16:50.652
I told you to be careful with that one.

16:50.724 --> 16:52.658
Find out who they are
and what they want.

16:52.726 --> 16:54.717
Done.

16:56.697 --> 16:58.688
What's wrong?

16:59.733 --> 17:01.724
You tell me.

17:04.738 --> 17:06.672
All right.

17:06.740 --> 17:09.503
Would you mind telling me about this
lady we almost got killed over?

17:10.743 --> 17:12.905
Her name is Linda Booton,
and I have to find her...

17:12.980 --> 17:15.380
before the headmaster
flies in tomorrow.

17:15.449 --> 17:20.079
- Say what?
- The headmaster from St. Helen's.

17:23.824 --> 17:25.758
Look, I got a call from this client.

17:25.826 --> 17:28.089
Actually, I didn't get the call.
Rick got the call.

17:28.162 --> 17:32.292
He told me to meet this woman at the state
capitol building, which is what I did.

17:32.366 --> 17:34.357
Only when I got there,
this woman turned out...

17:34.434 --> 17:38.200
to be five little girls from Vermont
who'd lost their schoolteacher.

17:38.272 --> 17:40.968
That's Linda.
See but, she really wasn't lost.

17:41.041 --> 17:44.169
She just took up with
a Hawaiian beach bum for the night.

17:44.244 --> 17:46.178
Anyway, like they said,

17:46.246 --> 17:49.909
she shouldn't be punished for her
passion, so I took the case.

17:49.983 --> 17:52.451
- Let me out.
- What?

17:52.519 --> 17:54.419
Let me out!

17:55.822 --> 17:58.450
T.C., I think
you're overreacting.

17:58.525 --> 18:01.585
I always do when I'm riding around
with a lunatic.

18:01.662 --> 18:03.653
Wait. T.C.!

18:03.730 --> 18:06.255
You know what? You're crazy, boy.
You are stone crazy.

18:06.333 --> 18:08.574
Stone crazy out your mind.
I'm crazy for riding with you.

18:08.602 --> 18:12.663
I don't think it's safe to leave
you in this part of town, T.C.

18:12.739 --> 18:14.730
Hey, T.C., come on back.

18:14.808 --> 18:17.436
We'll eat at the Blue Lagoon!

18:17.511 --> 18:19.877
On me!

18:19.947 --> 18:21.972
If T.C. didn't want to eat
at the Blue Lagoon,

18:22.049 --> 18:24.313
then he was really mad.

18:24.384 --> 18:28.844
Oh, well. He probably wouldn't want
to follow up my next lead anyway.

18:29.990 --> 18:32.356
Just look at you.
Every time that boy calls,

18:32.426 --> 18:35.259
you're the one that winds up
with your behind in the fire.

18:35.329 --> 18:37.610
Getting into a damn fight
in a room full of Mr. Universes.

18:37.631 --> 18:39.690
Man, you must be out your mind.

18:49.543 --> 18:51.977
I did a little thinking after T.C. left...

18:52.045 --> 18:55.344
and decided the clues that the girls
had given me weren't really clues,

18:55.415 --> 18:58.816
but ways to shorten
my life expectancy.

18:58.885 --> 19:01.547
Going back to their hotel
was my only hope.

19:08.095 --> 19:10.086
Hi.

19:11.098 --> 19:14.261
"Fruit of Passion. '" I didn't know
Robin Masters wrote agronomy novels.

19:14.334 --> 19:18.464
Huh? Uh, Miss Linda Booton.

19:18.538 --> 19:22.030
She checked in about three days ago
with five little girls.

19:22.109 --> 19:23.599
Yeah?

19:30.550 --> 19:33.451
You remember them?
Not for five lousy bucks.

19:37.057 --> 19:39.252
Well, kind of.

19:39.326 --> 19:41.260
Do you remember
Miss Booton's boyfriend?

19:41.328 --> 19:44.661
He's a big, Hawaiian lifeguard type.
He might've picked her up here.

19:44.731 --> 19:47.859
Mmm. Yeah, maybe.

19:50.070 --> 19:53.767
How about a license number or a
telephone number she might've called,

19:53.840 --> 19:56.331
or some messages,
something that might lead me to her?

19:56.410 --> 19:58.537
Yeah, I think so.

19:58.612 --> 20:01.479
For another five, I can give you a
number that'd take you right to her.

20:01.548 --> 20:03.539
I'd have to write a check.

20:06.720 --> 20:10.019
Room 2409.
She's been in all night.

20:11.258 --> 20:13.453
I could've had that for nothing.

20:16.129 --> 20:19.462
So far, this case had cost me
my right to the wine cellar,

20:19.533 --> 20:22.593
the last cash in my pocket
and nearly my life.

20:22.669 --> 20:26.036
If that clerk was lying to me,
I was gonna come back down here...

20:26.106 --> 20:30.236
and shove that Robin Masters
paperback in his ear.

20:30.310 --> 20:33.370
Who is it? Miss Booton?

20:33.447 --> 20:35.381
Who is it? Thomas Magnum.

20:35.449 --> 20:38.077
I think I have something of yours.

20:44.091 --> 20:46.082
Come in.

20:53.533 --> 20:55.467
Oh, those little brats!

20:55.535 --> 20:57.867
Boy, they've really
outdone themselves this time.

20:57.938 --> 21:00.168
A beachboy.

21:00.240 --> 21:03.539
At Easter in Yellowstone
it was a forest ranger.

21:03.610 --> 21:07.239
And at Thanksgiving in New York
it was a cab driver.

21:07.314 --> 21:09.305
Where are their parents?

21:09.383 --> 21:11.317
They're spread out
all over the world.

21:11.385 --> 21:14.183
Some of them are too isolated to get
together with them at holidays.

21:14.254 --> 21:17.314
And the rest of them would just
rather pay me to take care of them.

21:17.391 --> 21:21.885
So these little girls just make up these
stories about you running off with some man?

21:21.962 --> 21:23.896
Isn't that something?

21:23.964 --> 21:25.898
There is just no limit
to their imagination.

21:27.134 --> 21:29.295
If you really were here,
aren't you worried about them?

21:29.369 --> 21:32.167
- It's almost midnight.
- That late?

21:32.239 --> 21:34.434
Yes, it is. You'd think you'd
want to check up on them.

21:34.508 --> 21:37.068
Those kids have been running
around loose since this afternoon.

21:37.144 --> 21:39.840
Wait a minute. I'm sorry that
you got dragged into this,

21:39.913 --> 21:43.110
but don't come in here and start telling
me how I should take care of them.

21:43.183 --> 21:45.117
They told me that
they were spending the day...

21:45.185 --> 21:47.176
and having dinner
with the governor's daughter.

21:47.254 --> 21:50.314
A limo actually...
picked them up at 2:00.

21:55.862 --> 22:01.129
- Your phone's ringing.
- Hello.

22:02.836 --> 22:06.636
No, this isn't Nancy,
but Merry Christmas to you too.

22:07.641 --> 22:09.632
The wrong number.

22:19.085 --> 22:21.883
Well, Nancy, is it a go?

22:22.889 --> 22:24.880
I think so.

22:33.066 --> 22:36.058
How long have you been teaching art?
Three years.

22:36.136 --> 22:39.572
Really? You ought to see the Gauguin
that Robin Masters just bought.

22:39.639 --> 22:41.800
I think you'd really like it.

22:41.875 --> 22:44.503
Gauguin. Sure I would.

22:44.578 --> 22:46.808
Does my driving bother you? No.

22:46.880 --> 22:48.814
You seem nervous.
No, you're a great driver.

22:48.882 --> 22:50.816
You drive great.

22:50.884 --> 22:54.513
Well, some people don't like
to be taken for a ride.

22:54.588 --> 22:58.024
Anyway, ever since
we got the Gauguin, Higgins...

22:58.091 --> 23:02.221
he kind of runs the place...
he's really tightened security.

23:02.295 --> 23:05.162
The place is harder to get into
than a safe.

23:05.232 --> 23:07.393
I'd certainly hope so.

23:07.467 --> 23:11.130
But you know what Houdini used
to say about safes, don't you?

23:11.204 --> 23:13.638
No, not right offhand.

23:13.707 --> 23:17.074
He said they're easier
to break out of than into.

23:18.545 --> 23:21.173
Oh, really? Houdini said that?

23:21.248 --> 23:23.239
Houdini.

23:41.501 --> 23:45.062
- Hi, guys.
- Miss Booton.

23:55.348 --> 23:57.908
First of all,
please don't be mad at the girls.

23:57.983 --> 24:00.611
They were really only trying
to help me out.

24:00.686 --> 24:03.849
Second of all,

24:03.923 --> 24:06.483
that Gauguin is a fake.

24:09.028 --> 24:12.987
- Remarkable. She's even better than
you are. - No, really, it's a fake.

24:13.065 --> 24:16.592
We weren't trying to steal the Gauguin.
We were trying to return it.

24:16.669 --> 24:18.603
How'd you ever find her?

24:18.671 --> 24:21.731
- We gave you some really rotten leads.
- That's how.

24:21.807 --> 24:23.968
- Higgins!
- If you'd given him a decent lead,

24:24.043 --> 24:25.840
he would've blown it higher
than a Chinese firecracker.

24:25.911 --> 24:28.641
- I caught the girls. - Who wouldn't
have been here in the first place...

24:28.714 --> 24:31.046
had it not been for
your incredible gullibility.

24:31.117 --> 24:34.951
I'm calling the police. They can hold you
until we find out which is the original.

24:35.020 --> 24:37.147
Oh, no, please, Mr. Higgins.

24:37.223 --> 24:40.215
If you involve the police, you're
gonna bring unwarranted publicity...

24:40.292 --> 24:42.658
to some very prominent families,

24:42.728 --> 24:45.128
including Mr. Masters.

24:46.499 --> 24:49.229
You should be able to tell
which is the original.

24:51.971 --> 24:54.496
Assuming that
you're telling the truth,

24:54.573 --> 24:57.667
what were you doing with the original
in the first place?

24:59.545 --> 25:03.447
It all started when my younger sister
was accepted at the Sorbonne in Paris.

25:03.516 --> 25:07.316
Oh, please,
no soap opera sob stories.

25:07.386 --> 25:11.550
It's not a soap opera.
My parents couldn't afford it.

25:11.624 --> 25:15.583
But she is unbelievably talented,
and I'd do anything to see her go.

25:15.661 --> 25:19.392
So I made a deal with someone
to get enough money so she could.

25:19.465 --> 25:22.263
And I thought you'd have
a flimsy excuse.

25:22.334 --> 25:27.203
- What kind of a deal?
- I authenticate paintings.

25:27.273 --> 25:29.764
Mostly Impressionists.

25:29.842 --> 25:32.834
The art collector that sold the
Gauguin to Robin Masters...

25:32.912 --> 25:36.075
offered me a lot of money
to make a copy of the original,

25:36.148 --> 25:39.549
then authenticate the copy
and give the original back to him.

25:39.618 --> 25:43.577
It's his most prized painting. Really, I
think he'd rather die than give it up.

25:43.656 --> 25:47.183
- So you committed a crime.
- No!

25:47.259 --> 25:49.750
- Well, not totally.
- Oh?

25:49.829 --> 25:52.423
You're only a thief
if you're not caught, huh?

25:52.498 --> 25:55.365
But I didn't go through with it.
When it came right down to it,

25:55.434 --> 25:57.493
I couldn't give him back
the original.

25:57.570 --> 26:00.596
But by then,
the fake had been shipped here.

26:01.674 --> 26:04.142
So you're telling me that...

26:04.210 --> 26:07.646
this whole story about you
and the beach bum...

26:07.713 --> 26:09.943
and them with their crazy
little imaginations...

26:10.015 --> 26:12.313
was just used to get them
into the estate?

26:12.384 --> 26:14.716
That was our idea.

26:14.787 --> 26:18.689
Amazing. This is the original.

26:18.757 --> 26:21.624
There! You see? I told you!
Now everything is okay.

26:21.694 --> 26:24.822
No, everything is not okay. You and
these five urchins are involved...

26:24.897 --> 26:27.024
- in a very serious crime.
- Urchins?

26:27.099 --> 26:30.262
Hey, cool it, Higgins.
I told you the plan was our idea.

26:30.336 --> 26:34.067
- I'm calling the police.
- Why? What for?

26:34.139 --> 26:36.073
You've got your painting back.

26:36.141 --> 26:40.601
Why get five little girls into trouble
for trying to return something?

26:40.679 --> 26:43.239
I'm reporting you.

26:44.250 --> 26:47.014
If she goes, we go.

26:57.496 --> 27:00.090
At least Huggins let us go.

27:00.165 --> 27:02.099
Why doesn't that make me
feel better?

27:02.167 --> 27:06.467
You'd feel okay if Magnum hadn't been
such a spoilsport about the whole thing.

27:06.539 --> 27:09.940
But I'm afraid he was right.
We were committing a crime.

27:13.078 --> 27:16.809
Well, it worked, almost.

27:16.882 --> 27:19.851
Almost doesn't count,
does it, Miss Booton?

27:22.955 --> 27:25.219
Uh-oh.

27:31.697 --> 27:33.631
What's a four-letter word
for "" young girl"?

27:33.699 --> 27:35.633
"" Brat."

27:35.701 --> 27:39.102
"" Brat." Mahalo.

27:39.171 --> 27:41.105
Doesn't fit. It does in my book.

27:41.173 --> 27:43.937
It doesn't in my puzzle.
Then what'd you ask me for?

27:44.009 --> 27:46.876
Pardon me. I should've known
better than to bother you...

27:46.946 --> 27:49.813
while you're eating your breakfast in
a club that you're not a member of.

27:49.882 --> 27:52.442
I'm sorry. I've just been up all night.
I'm tired.

27:52.518 --> 27:54.850
I think they call that
an occupational hazard.

27:54.920 --> 27:58.378
No, they don't. It's called being
suckered by five little girls.

28:07.533 --> 28:10.331
- Yeah?
- There's this girl here to see Magnum.

28:10.402 --> 28:12.666
Is he there? There's a
girl here to see you.

28:12.738 --> 28:15.764
If she's under 16,
I don't wanna know.

28:15.841 --> 28:18.639
Who is it? I don't know, but
she sounds like a client.

28:18.711 --> 28:21.077
In that case, send her up.
"" Send her up"?

28:21.146 --> 28:24.741
Rick, come on. She's a potential client,
and you could use the business.

28:24.817 --> 28:27.752
I can use finishing my breakfast
in peace.

28:27.820 --> 28:30.653
You can use the bucks. Bye.
Wait a minute.

28:33.125 --> 28:35.685
Oh, no!
The girls have been kidnapped.

28:35.761 --> 28:38.389
Wait. Let me guess.
The kidnapper wants to exchange...

28:38.464 --> 28:40.432
the fake girls for the original...
Stop it!

28:40.499 --> 28:43.059
This is not a joke!
Did you call the police?

28:43.135 --> 28:46.468
No, he said he'd kill them if I did that.
Uh-huh. Uh-huh.

28:46.538 --> 28:50.065
We've got to do something fast,
or they're gonna die of heat exhaustion.

28:50.142 --> 28:53.077
Of what?
He called a half hour ago.

28:53.145 --> 28:55.238
He said he had them locked up
in a place where the temperature...

28:55.314 --> 28:57.805
would get to be 130 degrees
by noon.

28:57.883 --> 29:00.374
That's only three hours from now!

29:00.452 --> 29:03.285
That's very good. Have you ever
considered taking up acting?

29:07.226 --> 29:11.128
I am so unlike the person
you are seeing right now.

29:11.196 --> 29:14.131
I sound like a complete fruitcake.
I know it.

29:15.234 --> 29:17.668
I have a master's degree
from Brown University.

29:17.736 --> 29:20.830
I'm a Phi Beta Kappa. But look at me!
Look at me!

29:20.906 --> 29:25.002
I'm being chased by hoods. My girls
are kidnapped. They might die!

29:25.077 --> 29:27.545
Hey, Linda, come on.
I'm a good, honest person.

29:27.613 --> 29:29.547
I've never done anything
like this before.

29:29.615 --> 29:33.107
I don't believe this is happening!
Now wait. Calm down.

29:34.186 --> 29:36.120
Tell me what happened.

29:36.188 --> 29:38.679
I'm sorry. Who kidnapped them?

29:38.757 --> 29:41.851
The art collector
I switched the paintings for.

29:41.927 --> 29:43.861
But you canceled that deal.
I told you.

29:43.929 --> 29:47.296
He never would've sold the painting if he'd
thought he actually had to give it up.

29:47.366 --> 29:50.631
He was waiting with a gun last night
when we got back to the room.

29:50.703 --> 29:54.036
He took the girls, and he said if
he didn't get the Gauguin back...

29:54.106 --> 29:57.633
Wait a minute.
Nothing is going to happen to them.

29:57.710 --> 29:59.735
Nothing's gonna happen.

29:59.812 --> 30:03.908
I'll get the fake from Higgins,
and we'll give it to the kidnapper.

30:03.982 --> 30:06.177
If it fooled Higgins,
it can fool him.

30:06.251 --> 30:09.709
- I threw it away.
- You threw it...

30:09.788 --> 30:11.722
You threw away
that beautiful fake?

30:12.791 --> 30:14.850
Madam, please, control yourself.

30:14.927 --> 30:18.055
Control myself? How could you
throw that painting away? Linda...

30:18.130 --> 30:20.360
Boy, you really beat all...
Linda, come here.

30:20.432 --> 30:22.764
Look, Higgins and I
do this all the time.

30:22.835 --> 30:24.769
It's sort of a game.

30:24.837 --> 30:27.931
A game? My girls may be dying,
and you're playing a game?

30:28.006 --> 30:30.133
You're not going to get
anything from him this way.

30:30.209 --> 30:32.200
Just trust me.

30:35.314 --> 30:39.717
Higgins, we really do need that
fake Gauguin. This is an emergency.

30:39.785 --> 30:41.878
Somebody has kidnapped the girls.

30:43.756 --> 30:45.951
He has my wholehearted sympathy.

30:46.024 --> 30:48.959
This isn't funny. They're in danger.
just give me the fake.

30:49.027 --> 30:51.427
- I threw it away.
- Oh, come on!

30:51.497 --> 30:54.091
You're just trying to buy time
to think up some sort of a deal.

30:54.166 --> 30:57.260
What's it going to be this time?
The car? My bed?

30:57.336 --> 31:00.499
- My firstborn male child? What?
- I'm buying no such thing.

31:00.572 --> 31:05.100
- I threw that cheap imitation away. - Then
we're gonna have to take the original.

31:05.177 --> 31:09.910
- That's not amusing, Magnum. - Higgins,
five little girls are going to die...

31:09.982 --> 31:12.542
unless I deliver that Gauguin
to the person who's holding them.

31:12.618 --> 31:14.586
I don't care
what that's worth in cash,

31:14.653 --> 31:16.985
but I can't believe
that you think it's worth...

31:17.055 --> 31:19.888
those little girls' lives.!

31:19.958 --> 31:22.791
Or do you?

31:29.401 --> 31:31.392
There he is.

31:39.945 --> 31:42.846
There'd better be a kidnapper, Magnum.
There's a kidnapper, Higgins.

31:42.915 --> 31:46.851
- Because if there isn't...
- There is a kidnapper, Higgins.

31:59.998 --> 32:01.932
I'm sweating.

32:02.000 --> 32:04.935
We're all sweating.
But I hate sweating.

32:05.003 --> 32:07.096
Darlene.

32:09.041 --> 32:12.875
I'm scared. I have to
sing when I'm scared.

32:12.945 --> 32:17.314
Melissa, it's important that
we try and conserve our energy.

32:17.382 --> 32:21.648
I wonder how hot it is.
I bet it's over 150 degrees.

32:23.088 --> 32:25.488
- That's hot enough to cook a turkey.
- Carolyn.

32:34.032 --> 32:36.728
Don't think you're going to get away
with this outrageous scheme.

32:36.802 --> 32:39.566
It's not an outrageous scheme.
Would you just shut up?

32:39.638 --> 32:42.801
Once this is over, there's going to be a
whole new set of rules at the estate.

32:42.875 --> 32:45.241
Higgins...
Can't you drive any faster?

32:59.791 --> 33:02.225
You can no longer come and
go as you please. Higgins...

33:02.294 --> 33:04.228
No longer be allowed
in the main house.

33:05.497 --> 33:07.431
Okay, let's take them down.

33:07.499 --> 33:09.433
You'll no longer use
any of the facilities.

33:09.501 --> 33:12.402
No more of your guests
will be allowed on the premises.

33:12.471 --> 33:14.462
You cannot use the phone.

33:19.478 --> 33:22.106
I think it's time we switched
driving partners.

33:34.593 --> 33:37.562
- What was that?
- It's the volcano.

33:37.629 --> 33:40.325
It's going to explode
like Mount St. Helene.

33:40.399 --> 33:42.663
Diamond Head is a dead volcano.

33:42.734 --> 33:45.100
I bet that's what they said
about Mount St. Helene.

33:45.170 --> 33:48.298
I'm scared.

33:48.373 --> 33:51.365
Just be quiet, Melissa.
Try to think happy thoughts.

33:52.711 --> 33:55.271
? On the first day of Christmas?

33:55.347 --> 33:57.542
? My true love gave to me?

33:57.616 --> 34:00.949
? A partridge in a pear tree?

34:01.019 --> 34:04.887
- ? On the second day of Christmas...?
- Melissa.

34:04.957 --> 34:09.087
? On the second day of Christmas...?
Melissa.

34:12.197 --> 34:14.391
I have to go to the bathroom.

34:14.466 --> 34:18.266
?Five golden rings?

34:18.337 --> 34:21.931
? Four calling birds
three French hens?

34:22.007 --> 34:27.603
? Two turtle doves
and a partridge in a pear tree?

34:32.717 --> 34:34.913
Welcome to the party, Thomas.

34:36.388 --> 34:39.482
- Are you in charge here?
- Who's he?

34:39.558 --> 34:41.650
- He's the butler.
- I am not the butler.

34:41.726 --> 34:44.321
I'm head of security
on the Robin Masters estate.

34:44.396 --> 34:46.556
Why were you looking
for Roxanne?

34:46.630 --> 34:48.621
Roxanne?
I don't know any Roxanne.

34:48.699 --> 34:50.964
- That's me.
- How do you do?

34:51.036 --> 34:54.766
- He wasn't looking for her. He was.
- No, I wasn't. I was looking for her.

34:54.840 --> 34:57.331
Ask T.C.
Oh, no, don't ask me nothin'.

34:57.409 --> 35:01.038
- Oh, you're T.C.
- T.C., I'm sorry. This is Linda.

35:01.113 --> 35:04.446
- Knock off the tea party introductions.
- Hey.

35:04.516 --> 35:07.508
I think I can explain
this whole misunderstanding.

35:07.586 --> 35:10.680
- No, you can't.
- Higgins.

35:11.690 --> 35:16.218
See, I was hired by five little girls
to find their schoolteacher.

35:16.294 --> 35:18.228
That is Linda.

35:18.296 --> 35:21.857
But they didn't want me to find Linda,
so they gave me all these false leads.

35:21.933 --> 35:24.868
One of the false leads
was the address to your place.

35:24.936 --> 35:28.133
So, naturally, when T.C. and I...

35:28.206 --> 35:32.165
started asking around about a blonde
with a Hawaiian beach bum... boy,

35:32.244 --> 35:35.702
your friend here just naturally assumed
that I was looking for Roxanne.

35:35.781 --> 35:39.444
But I wasn't looking for Roxanne. I was
looking for Linda, and I found her,

35:39.518 --> 35:41.986
even though they really
didn't want me to find her.

35:42.054 --> 35:46.218
So, see, it was all just this great,
big misunderstanding.

35:49.428 --> 35:51.362
Why were you
looking for Roxanne?

35:52.764 --> 35:55.198
- I told you.
- Will you shut up?

35:55.267 --> 35:57.201
I wasn't looking for Roxanne.

35:57.269 --> 35:59.499
I was looking for Linda
who looks like Roxanne.

35:59.571 --> 36:01.937
- I do not.
- What do you mean by that?

36:02.007 --> 36:05.636
Shut up, all of you! I've been
a successful businessman for years.

36:05.710 --> 36:11.148
Suddenly I get a new girlfriend who has private eyes
following her around, and I'm no longer successful.

36:11.216 --> 36:15.016
- See, I just explained that. Maybe...
- Thomas, please.

36:15.087 --> 36:19.023
- Don't tell that story again.
- First, the listening devices,

36:19.091 --> 36:21.025
then money starts disappearing.

36:21.093 --> 36:25.792
- Now some of my clients are changing
neighborhoods. - All right! All right!

36:25.864 --> 36:28.765
- I was working for Roxanne. She hired me.
- What?

36:31.136 --> 36:33.570
But not to follow you.

36:33.638 --> 36:35.731
- To follow him.
- What?

36:35.807 --> 36:39.004
Oh, it happens this way every time.

36:39.077 --> 36:41.671
The right-hand man tries to take over.
Think about it.

36:41.746 --> 36:44.271
Who has more access to you
than him?

36:44.349 --> 36:48.445
And as for her, you should be thanking
her for turning me on to this.

36:48.520 --> 36:52.012
She was just worried about you getting
wiped out by your best friend.

36:52.090 --> 36:56.049
- Mano, he's crazy.
- Hear! Hear!

36:56.128 --> 36:59.689
You gonna believe this guy?
He's just fast-talking you.

36:59.764 --> 37:01.698
Oh, it's so typical.

37:01.766 --> 37:03.700
They always blame the girlfriend.

37:03.768 --> 37:05.759
Hell, she was just trying
to protect you.

37:05.837 --> 37:09.068
I'll bet that he has the combination
to your personal safe.

37:09.141 --> 37:12.474
Yeah. Hey, Mano, it
ain't like it looks.

37:12.544 --> 37:15.069
I mean, maybe I took
a little now and then.

37:15.147 --> 37:17.707
Nothing big. Honest. Honest!

37:17.782 --> 37:20.410
It was just pocket money.!

37:21.686 --> 37:24.382
After all the years
we've been together.

37:30.996 --> 37:33.430
Where'd you get all that madness
you was talkin' in there?

37:33.498 --> 37:35.523
I made it up. Mm-hmm.

37:36.535 --> 37:38.935
You made it up?
It worked, didn't it?

37:39.004 --> 37:42.701
?Four calling birds
three French hens?

37:42.774 --> 37:44.605
? Two turtle doves?

37:44.676 --> 37:48.703
?And a partridge in a pear tree?

38:03.895 --> 38:06.693
- Wait a minute. Where are you going?
- To make the drop.

38:06.765 --> 38:09.199
No, you're not. He could be waiting
in there for you. I'll take it.

38:09.267 --> 38:12.998
- No, he is expecting me. - That's right.
You're a loose end in his crime.

38:13.071 --> 38:18.031
- What are you saying? - Linda, he has five
little girls locked away where they could die.

38:18.109 --> 38:20.043
He may want them to die. No.

38:20.111 --> 38:22.807
You are going to have to
face that possibility.

38:22.881 --> 38:25.247
He could be waiting in there to
kill you once he has the painting.

38:25.317 --> 38:27.357
There's no loose ends that way.
I'll take it. No. No.

38:27.419 --> 38:29.614
- T.C.
- Magnum!

38:29.688 --> 38:32.680
Magnum, no! Come... Magnum!

38:32.757 --> 38:36.818
Two million marks.

38:37.896 --> 38:40.456
I can't believe
I'm letting him do this.

39:34.085 --> 39:36.883
- Well?
- There's nothing in there.

39:36.955 --> 39:39.651
What?
Except Robin Masters's Gauguin.

39:39.724 --> 39:41.988
The kidnapper is in there.
He has to be!

39:42.060 --> 39:44.927
Believe me, Linda. There's
nothing in there but the fish.

41:45.550 --> 41:48.280
? Three French hens
two turtle doves?

41:48.353 --> 41:52.084
?And a partridge in a pear tree??

41:57.695 --> 42:01.961
Now that the drop had been made,
the worst part was the waiting.

42:03.535 --> 42:05.935
As soon as the kidnapper
calls with the girls' location,

42:06.004 --> 42:07.938
I'm calling the police.

42:08.006 --> 42:11.032
Higgins, first we make sure
the girls are safe,

42:11.109 --> 42:13.229
then we get the painting
without involving the police.

42:13.278 --> 42:16.509
- What?
- T.C. and I have it all worked out.

42:16.581 --> 42:20.108
- Don't worry. - Good. Then you can
explain your plan to the police.

42:20.185 --> 42:22.625
Higgins, I don't want to have to
get into this again with you.

42:22.687 --> 42:26.748
We are not going to let Linda and the
girls get in trouble with the police.

42:28.226 --> 42:30.387
Give me that.

42:30.462 --> 42:34.023
Yeah. Yeah.

42:37.902 --> 42:40.803
They're in a civil defense tunnel
in Diamond Head. Come on.

42:44.576 --> 42:47.704
Five-O, I want to report a theft.

42:47.779 --> 42:51.408
This is the chief security officer
of Robin Masters's estate.

42:53.551 --> 42:55.542
Unhand me!

42:59.257 --> 43:01.248
This is outrageous!

43:02.961 --> 43:05.930
Outrageous!

43:09.200 --> 43:11.134
Can't you stall them?

43:11.202 --> 43:13.170
It's Rick. He trailed the
kidnapper to the airport.

43:13.238 --> 43:15.934
Good-bye, Gauguin.
Stay with him the best you can.

43:56.514 --> 43:59.779
Nancy.! Melissa.!

43:59.851 --> 44:01.785
Get them out of here.
It's like an oven in here.

44:01.853 --> 44:04.413
I knew you'd save us, Magnum.

44:04.489 --> 44:05.979
Come on.

44:11.195 --> 44:14.358
The girls were fine by the time
we got some liquid in them,

44:14.432 --> 44:18.129
but we left them with Linda at the
emergency center just to be sure.

44:19.203 --> 44:24.106
My instinct was to lock this guy away
in that tunnel for a couple of days,

44:24.175 --> 44:27.235
but that would only bring the police
and involve the girls,

44:27.312 --> 44:30.509
so I had another plan.

44:44.162 --> 44:46.122
They just called his plane.
We've got 10 minutes.

44:46.164 --> 44:48.964
If we're gonna get the painting back,
we gotta do it now. It's Gate 18.

45:04.082 --> 45:06.073
Passengers for
Pan Pacific Flight 210...

45:06.150 --> 45:09.847
from Honolulu to San Francisco
now boarding at Gate 11.

45:11.222 --> 45:13.213
Show me one of these leis.

45:22.133 --> 45:25.125
Uh, yeah... No, this is not me.
This is not me.

45:25.203 --> 45:27.637
It's not... It's not...
It's not manly enough.

45:27.705 --> 45:29.866
I want a manly...
you know, a macho-looking lei.

45:29.941 --> 45:33.707
Show me another one. Show me another one.
just show me another one.

45:37.248 --> 45:40.081
It's not me either. It's...

45:40.151 --> 45:42.517
You got a macho lei?

45:50.294 --> 45:53.388
Captain Walt Connors, please pick up
the white courtesy telephone.

45:53.464 --> 45:56.991
Captain Walt Connors, please pick
up the white courtesy telephone.

46:03.374 --> 46:05.638
What the...

46:05.710 --> 46:08.440
- I'm telling you the truth...
- Pardon me, sir.

46:08.513 --> 46:10.513
I'm gonna have to ask you
to go back through again.

46:10.515 --> 46:14.679
- For what? Obviously I don't have
anything on me. - Please stay back, folks.

46:14.752 --> 46:16.686
Please go back through.
I gotta go back through?

46:16.754 --> 46:18.278
Yes.

46:18.356 --> 46:22.486
It's a good thing I got here early. I never would've
catched my flight. I'm sure glad I'm not in a hurry.

46:22.560 --> 46:25.290
Can you empty your pockets?

46:25.363 --> 46:28.161
Again? Oh, I got it.

46:28.232 --> 46:31.133
Must be these keys. Right.

46:31.202 --> 46:33.193
Okay, step back.

46:34.939 --> 46:38.431
Excuse me, sir. Do you know how
to load one of these things? No.

46:38.509 --> 46:41.273
Yeah, me neither.
Me, I'm a simple guy.

46:41.345 --> 46:44.314
I would've been happy with one of those
cameras that James Garner pitches on TV.

46:44.382 --> 46:46.873
It's your turn to go through.
Yeah, right. I'm sorry.

46:46.951 --> 46:49.181
Say, would you mind
holding this for me?

46:49.253 --> 46:51.187
Put it on the ramp.
Put it on the ramp.

46:51.255 --> 46:54.190
Right. I'm sorry. Excuse me, okay?
Excuse me.

46:55.426 --> 46:58.987
Transglobal Flight 50
is now arriving at Gate Six.

46:59.063 --> 47:02.760
Transglobal Flight 50
is now arriving at Gate Six.

47:09.040 --> 47:10.974
I'd give anything to see
the look on that turkey's face...

47:11.042 --> 47:13.806
when he finds out
what's really in there.

47:21.586 --> 47:23.577
Merry Christmas, Higgins.

47:25.223 --> 47:28.386
I understand it was
a smashing rescue, Mr. Higgins.

47:28.459 --> 47:30.518
I wouldn't know,

47:30.595 --> 47:33.029
having been detained
against my will.

47:33.097 --> 47:35.463
Well, we didn't get to see
much either.

47:35.533 --> 47:38.229
But the best part
was when Magnum saved us.

47:38.302 --> 47:41.032
You were wonderful, Magnum.

47:41.105 --> 47:43.903
Well, I wouldn't say that.

47:43.975 --> 47:47.240
But at least I can tell Mr. Masters
we have the original back.

47:47.311 --> 47:49.905
You called Robin? I have a
call into him in St. Tropez.

47:49.981 --> 47:53.348
As soon as he returns it, I shall tell
him that his Gauguin is now safe,

47:53.417 --> 47:57.319
although it had been stolen by
clients of his guest, Thomas Magnum.

47:57.388 --> 47:59.413
We'll see how welcome
you are around here then.

48:00.758 --> 48:02.878
Gee, I don't know.
What do you think Robin will say...

48:02.927 --> 48:07.296
when you tell him five little girls
beat your security system?
