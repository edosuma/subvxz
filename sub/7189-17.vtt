00:05.922 --> 00:07.966
The principal isn't
just any witch.

00:08.048 --> 00:10.093
The principal
is a Chosen One.

00:10.176 --> 00:14.139
- What--I thought Emma was
the Chosen One.

00:14.222 --> 00:17.058
- She is.
It's complicated.

00:17.142 --> 00:18.810
At first, I thought
the principal

00:18.893 --> 00:20.770
was just a disgraced witch

00:20.854 --> 00:22.605
that had managed
to steal her powers back

00:22.689 --> 00:25.900
little by little,
but she's much more than that.

00:25.984 --> 00:28.111
- But then they should be
sending extra guardians,

00:28.194 --> 00:29.863

01:05.397 --> 01:06.941
- So you know.
- Yes.

01:07.025 --> 01:08.860
And my son tells me
you went to see the Council.

01:08.943 --> 01:10.820
- I did, and I told them
who you are.

01:10.904 --> 01:12.197
- Oh, and let me guess.

01:12.280 --> 01:13.323
The council told you
to stay away.

01:13.406 --> 01:16.242

- It's the rules.

01:16.326 --> 01:18.828
There can be
only one Chosen One,

01:18.912 --> 01:20.455
hence the name Chosen One.

01:20.538 --> 01:22.165

10:45.561 --> 10:48.272
you should've told me
that you are the Chosen One.

10:48.356 --> 10:50.066
- Wait. What?

10:50.149 --> 10:53.069
- You didn't know
that you're the Chosen One,

10:53.152 --> 10:54.403
future leader of all witches

10:54.487 --> 10:56.197
and soon-to-be obliterator
of humankind?

10:56.280 --> 10:58.366
- Blita-what?

10:58.449 --> 11:00.326
And no.

11:00.409 --> 11:02.661
My mom said we're looking
for the Chosen One

11:02.745 --> 11:05.581
so we could steal her powers
during the eclipse and--

11:05.664 --> 11:08.250
[gasps]
O.M.P.

11:08.334 --> 11:11.796
She tricked me
so she could steal my powers.

11:11.879 --> 11:13.547
- Makes sense.

11:13.631 --> 11:17.593
Powerless witches are
always jealous of real ones.

11:17.676 --> 11:20.763
- She does seem jealous
of me and my powers,

11:20.846 --> 11:22.765
as jealous as all
the other girls in school are

11:22.848 --> 11:24.934
of my beauty, popularity,
and intelligence-ry.

11:25.017 --> 11:31.232
So that's why she wanted
the ha-rosanna-we-ro-san?

11:31.315 --> 11:32.775
- Y-yes.

11:32.858 --> 11:34.860
During the eclipse,
she reads a few lines from it

11:34.944 --> 11:36.570
to steal your powers.

11:36.654 --> 11:38.531
That's why I need
to get it back:

11:38.614 --> 11:40.074
to keep it safe

11:40.157 --> 11:43.119
and out of your mother's
clammy little claws.

11:43.202 --> 11:44.120
- Well, good luck with that.

11:44.203 --> 11:46.455
Emma and her
little mini onion, Andi,

11:46.539 --> 11:47.623
stole it from me.

11:47.706 --> 11:49.542
- Mini onion?
- Yeah.

11:49.625 --> 11:51.085
Someone who always does what
someone else tells them to?

11:51.168 --> 11:53.963
- Well, anyway,

11:54.046 --> 11:56.173
that's why I need you
to get it back for me.

11:59.552 --> 12:00.636
- [sighs]

12:00.719 --> 12:04.223
If dressing like me
is your idea of a joke--

12:04.306 --> 12:05.099
- No, I didn't.

12:05.182 --> 12:07.643
I don't know how this happened.

12:07.726 --> 12:11.063
- And what about
the caterpillar in your face?

12:11.814 --> 12:14.275
- [whimpers]
- Dad!

12:14.358 --> 12:15.401
DANIEL: Ah!

12:21.615 --> 12:22.908
- Daniel--Daniel--

12:24.702 --> 12:27.329
- I--I--I've got to go.

12:29.915 --> 12:31.625
- Oh, are you okay?
DANIEL: I'm fine.

12:33.127 --> 12:34.295
MR. ALONSO: [sighs]

12:34.378 --> 12:35.713
You need to stay away
from Daniel.

12:36.755 --> 12:38.632
- Dad, he wasn't
making fun of you.

12:38.716 --> 12:42.011
It was my fault.
- I mean it, Emma.

12:42.094 --> 12:44.221
No more Daniel Miller.

12:54.273 --> 12:56.650
KATIE: I thought your mom said
that she was your guardian.

12:56.734 --> 12:58.360
- Yeah, well,
she says a lot of things

12:58.444 --> 12:59.528
that aren't true,

12:59.612 --> 13:00.905
like, "plaid doesn't
look good on you.

13:00.988 --> 13:02.198
"You're not the chosen one.

13:02.281 --> 13:03.949
Broccoli is a dessert."

13:04.033 --> 13:04.909
- I don't know, Maddie.

13:04.992 --> 13:07.536
It seems almost too convenient.

13:07.620 --> 13:09.205
- I'll tell you
what was really convenient:

13:09.288 --> 13:12.041
Her forgetting to train me
like she was supposed to.

13:12.124 --> 13:13.584
- You should talk to her
anyways.

13:13.667 --> 13:16.921
- No, I'm the Chosen One,

13:17.004 --> 13:20.007
and I get to decide what to do.
Now help me.

13:20.090 --> 13:22.551
The principal said
to have that, uh--

13:22.635 --> 13:24.386
That--that boy with me.

13:24.470 --> 13:26.180
- Diego?
MADDIE: Yes.

13:26.680 --> 13:28.265
Panthers.

13:33.270 --> 13:35.397
Hi...

13:35.481 --> 13:38.234
- Diego.
- Hi, Diego.

13:38.317 --> 13:39.318
Have you seen this?

13:39.401 --> 13:40.528
[snaps fingers]

13:44.031 --> 13:45.950
- The school dance? Yeah.
What about it?

13:46.033 --> 13:47.576
- Maddie doesn't have a date.

13:47.660 --> 13:49.203
- Wink, wink.

13:49.286 --> 13:50.996
I told you.
I'm not good at winking.

13:52.331 --> 13:53.624
- So?

13:53.707 --> 13:56.961
- So...good luck finding a date.

14:03.801 --> 14:07.263
- Something strange
is going on,

14:07.346 --> 14:08.472
and you're the only ones
I can count on

14:08.556 --> 14:10.724
to help me figure out what.

14:10.808 --> 14:12.601
- Is that going to happen to me?

14:12.685 --> 14:13.686
- Eh, probably.

14:13.769 --> 14:15.729
- It might be
temporary amnesia.

14:15.813 --> 14:17.690
- Or a Jekyll and Hyde
kind of deal.

14:17.773 --> 14:19.567
- No.
I told you, it wasn't me.

14:19.650 --> 14:21.694
- So you think it was Emma.
- No.

14:21.777 --> 14:23.654
I mean, I know there's
a lot of strange things

14:23.737 --> 14:24.989
that happen
when she's there,

14:25.072 --> 14:27.366
but she's so good and kind.

14:27.449 --> 14:29.285
It's like there's something
around her and me

14:29.368 --> 14:30.619
that's messing with us.

14:30.703 --> 14:32.621
- Sounds like you've got
a case of the Maddies.

14:32.705 --> 14:34.957
- What?
- Isn't it obvious?

14:35.040 --> 14:37.167
Maddie hates
that you and Emma are all...

14:39.169 --> 14:41.547
so she's trying
to break you guys up

14:41.630 --> 14:45.134
by making you think Emma is
doing all these things to you.

14:45.217 --> 14:47.177
- That does sound like
something Maddie would do.

14:47.261 --> 14:49.305
Still,
even if that's the case,

14:49.388 --> 14:50.431
I need to figure out how

14:50.514 --> 14:52.349
Maddie's making
all these things happen.

14:52.433 --> 14:53.517
- You don't have to.

14:53.601 --> 14:54.768
- That's what we're here for.

14:54.852 --> 14:55.728
- Thanks, guys.

14:55.811 --> 14:58.355
- You know our fee, right?

14:59.648 --> 15:00.649
[sighs]

15:12.328 --> 15:14.246
- Ugh.

15:14.330 --> 15:16.123
- Diego.
- Hi, Diego.

15:16.206 --> 15:18.876
You and I never finished
our conversation yesterday.

15:18.959 --> 15:22.004
- About?
- The dance, duh.

15:22.087 --> 15:24.340
You were about to ask someone
to go with you.

15:24.423 --> 15:26.216
- I was?

15:27.885 --> 15:29.261
Who?

15:29.345 --> 15:31.930
- Me, and I'm waiting.

15:32.014 --> 15:34.099
- You want to go
to the dance with me?

15:34.183 --> 15:35.309
[Panthers gasp]

15:35.392 --> 15:37.561
- How unexpected!
I'm so flattered.

15:37.645 --> 15:39.271
And my answer is yes.

15:40.606 --> 15:42.483
Wonderful.
We're done here.

15:44.610 --> 15:46.070
DIEGO: Wait.

15:46.153 --> 15:48.155
I'm not going
to the dance with you.

15:48.238 --> 15:50.824
- Oh, if it's because
of Daniel, don't worry.

15:50.908 --> 15:53.702
He's not gonna ask me--
- No, it's because of you.

15:53.786 --> 15:55.663
You're a witch, and I have
to stay away from you.

15:55.746 --> 15:58.040
- Did he just--
[laughs]

16:06.006 --> 16:08.384
- T3, are you ready?
- Ready?

16:08.467 --> 16:09.927
[all groaning]

16:10.010 --> 16:11.929
- Great going, Mel.

16:12.012 --> 16:13.597
- Way to blend in.

16:13.681 --> 16:15.265
- It's hard being the one
on top.

16:15.349 --> 16:16.308
I have to stand
totally straight

16:16.392 --> 16:18.060
but then arch my head
to the side

16:18.143 --> 16:19.395
without hitting you guys.

16:19.478 --> 16:21.897
- Okay, shh.
Now everyone's looking at us.

16:21.980 --> 16:24.817
- The trick is to act
like you belong.

16:24.900 --> 16:26.443
Follow me.

16:29.446 --> 16:30.239
ROBERT: Whatever.

16:32.658 --> 16:35.244
- Hey, how you doin'?

16:36.954 --> 16:38.664
- This is silly!
What are we doing?

16:38.747 --> 16:41.083
- We're spying on Emma.

16:41.166 --> 16:42.626
That's why we skipped a class,
isn't it?

16:42.710 --> 16:45.254
- We didn't skip.
It was teacher planning day.

16:45.337 --> 16:48.298
- Now this only became
half as fun.

16:48.382 --> 16:49.925
- And would you like
to go home?

16:50.008 --> 16:53.595
- Nah, spying is always
way better than watching TV.

16:53.679 --> 16:56.932
- I brought my phone
so we can do both.

16:57.015 --> 16:58.016
MEL: Nice. Come on.

16:59.643 --> 17:01.311
- Hey, Katie.
Hey, Sophie.

17:01.395 --> 17:02.771
- Hey, Da--Oh, my panther.

17:02.855 --> 17:04.314
What is that?

17:04.397 --> 17:05.523
- Squirrel!

17:05.607 --> 17:09.403
[screaming]

17:18.203 --> 17:20.289
{\an8}And it jumped
right on his face,

17:20.372 --> 17:21.498
{\an8}almost like
it had taken over his face

17:21.582 --> 17:23.541
{\an8}and become a part of it.

17:23.625 --> 17:24.376
{\an8}- And then what did you do?

17:24.460 --> 17:26.462
{\an8}- I beat it away
with my purse.

17:26.545 --> 17:28.714
{\an8}Good thing I had
my rock collection in it.

17:28.797 --> 17:30.132
{\an8}That squirrel
didn't stand a chance.

17:32.217 --> 17:33.677
- Poor Daniel.

17:33.761 --> 17:35.429
I should go look for him
and take the unibrow off.

17:35.512 --> 17:37.806
- Yeah, I mean,
it was funny for a while,

17:37.890 --> 17:39.975
but now it's just sad.

17:40.058 --> 17:42.311
- [laughs]

17:42.394 --> 17:43.645
You know what you should do?

17:43.729 --> 17:46.148
You should leave it
and then add, like, a large nose

17:46.231 --> 17:48.192
and then maybe make
his forehead huge.

17:48.275 --> 17:50.277
[laughs]

17:50.360 --> 17:51.653
What?
Weren't we piling it on?

17:51.737 --> 17:53.363
- I need to undo it.

17:53.447 --> 17:54.907
- Wait.

17:54.990 --> 17:56.116
What I meant was, with your
powers being all wacked,

17:56.200 --> 17:59.203
you might make him
look like a werewolf,

17:59.286 --> 18:01.038
which would be totally--
- Cool.

18:01.121 --> 18:04.249
- I think I can manage
a tiny spell.

18:04.333 --> 18:05.834
I'm feeling a lot better.

18:05.918 --> 18:08.253
- Okay, but whatever you do,

18:08.337 --> 18:10.172
don't think of a forehead
full of zits.

18:11.465 --> 18:12.007
Or a giant humpback.

18:12.090 --> 18:13.717
EMMA: I won't.

18:15.427 --> 18:17.596
- [gasps]
Ooh, there's Daniel.

18:17.679 --> 18:18.764
- Uh, Maddie, there's something
you should know

18:18.847 --> 18:21.016
about Daniel's face.

18:21.099 --> 18:23.018
- Hey, Daniel.
Guess who's gonna--

18:23.936 --> 18:26.980
[screaming]

18:29.191 --> 18:29.858
- What is it?

18:29.942 --> 18:31.693
- What's with the--

18:31.777 --> 18:32.694
- I'm still me.

18:32.778 --> 18:35.114
- Yeah,
keep telling yourself that.

18:37.157 --> 18:39.701
- Squirrel!

18:39.785 --> 18:41.203
- No, no.

18:41.286 --> 18:43.080
SOPHIE: Ah! Ah!
DANIEL: Stop, stop.

18:43.163 --> 18:45.624
- You've suffered enough,
I think.

18:45.707 --> 18:47.209
So now let's make
your eyebrows shrink.

18:55.968 --> 18:57.052
- Are they that bad?

18:57.135 --> 19:00.973
KATIE: Actually,
they look fine to me.

19:01.682 --> 19:05.060
See?
No squirrel.

19:05.144 --> 19:06.770
Now let's go.

19:12.609 --> 19:14.486
- Oh, no.

19:16.029 --> 19:18.657
At least I got Daniel right.

19:21.159 --> 19:23.287
- Cool, a hoedown.

19:23.370 --> 19:26.707
I can finally break out
all my sweet cowboy gear.

19:28.166 --> 19:30.586
Hey, do you think Emma
would want to go with me?

19:30.669 --> 19:32.296
- No!

19:32.379 --> 19:33.755
- Oh, okay.

19:33.839 --> 19:36.008
- Wait, no. Wait.

19:36.091 --> 19:38.677
I mean, look,

19:38.760 --> 19:40.262
it's the same night
as the eclipse,

19:40.345 --> 19:44.975
so I think she'll be
otherwise occupied.

19:46.685 --> 19:47.603
- I see.

19:47.686 --> 19:49.855
- Why would they schedule
a dance

19:49.938 --> 19:52.357
the same night as the eclipse?

19:52.441 --> 19:54.234
This can't be a coincidence.

19:58.572 --> 20:02.159
- Tell Emma I have my own spurs
and a ten-gallon hat.

20:02.242 --> 20:02.326
No--

20:06.705 --> 20:08.373
- Hey, wait up.
Hey.

20:08.457 --> 20:11.960
Uh, notice anything different?

20:12.044 --> 20:13.462
- Hmm.

20:13.545 --> 20:14.504
No.

20:14.588 --> 20:15.672
- What?

20:15.756 --> 20:17.591
- Just kidding.

20:17.674 --> 20:19.259
Your eyebrows
are back to normal.

20:19.343 --> 20:21.094
- Yeah.
Wait, wait, wait.

20:22.179 --> 20:24.765
Um, there's this dance
next week.

20:24.848 --> 20:26.016
It's a cowboy thing.

20:26.099 --> 20:27.392
It's kind of silly,

20:27.476 --> 20:28.727
but I'm singing at it
this year,

20:28.810 --> 20:30.938
and I wanted to know if, well,

20:31.021 --> 20:32.648
you would go with me?

20:32.731 --> 20:34.608
- I'd love to.
When is it?

20:34.691 --> 20:37.319
- It's next Friday.
- Friday?

20:37.402 --> 20:38.445
There's an eclipse
that night.

20:38.528 --> 20:39.529
- Yeah,
it'll be really cool.

20:39.613 --> 20:40.697
We can watch it together.

20:40.781 --> 20:42.366
- I can't. I'm sorry.

20:42.449 --> 20:44.409
- Why?
- Um--

20:44.493 --> 20:45.827
- Is it because of Maddie

20:45.911 --> 20:47.329
and how she'll try to make
our lives miserable

20:47.412 --> 20:49.623
if we go together?
- Yes, that's exactly why.

20:49.706 --> 20:51.416
- Well, I don't care
about that.

20:51.500 --> 20:56.004
Besides, we can weather
the Maddie storm together.

20:56.088 --> 20:57.589
- I still can't.
I'm sorry.

21:01.176 --> 21:03.804
- So did you find out anything
about the dance

21:03.887 --> 21:05.597
being the same night
as the eclipse and everything?

21:05.681 --> 21:07.808
- Uh, no, not yet.

21:07.891 --> 21:10.185
But it did make me realize
how we really need

21:10.269 --> 21:11.353
to get back on track
with preparing for it.

21:11.436 --> 21:14.231
- Oh, well,
I can help you with that.

21:14.314 --> 21:15.607
I've been line dancing
since I was seven.

21:15.691 --> 21:18.276
- What?
Not the dance, the eclipse.

21:19.152 --> 21:20.445
- Oh, yeah, right.

21:23.115 --> 21:24.908
Is that Emma's magic book,
the Hexoren?

21:24.992 --> 21:26.326
- Yes, and shh!

21:27.953 --> 21:29.204
- Shouldn't you keep it
out of school

21:29.288 --> 21:30.497
because of you know who?

21:30.580 --> 21:33.375
- It's safest to be near me
at all times.

21:33.458 --> 21:34.459
I also need the book
to help Emma prepare

21:34.543 --> 21:37.504
to do battle
the night of the eclipse.

21:37.587 --> 21:39.631
All those witches fighting
to steal her powers,

21:39.715 --> 21:41.675
it could get ugly.

21:41.758 --> 21:44.011
- I thought preparing Emma
for battle was Lily's job,

21:44.094 --> 21:46.304
since she's Emma's guardian.

21:46.388 --> 21:47.389
- Yeah, Lily's gone now.

21:47.472 --> 21:50.767
From here on out,
it's just us.

21:53.854 --> 21:54.980
- Wait, where are you--

21:55.063 --> 21:57.441
ALL: I can't believe
what I just heard.
