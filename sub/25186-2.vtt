00:14.000 --> 00:17.680
Previously on Love Island...

00:17.720 --> 00:21.440
five girls hit the Villa.

00:23.640 --> 00:25.640
<font color="#FFFF00">Wanna meet some boys?</font>
ALL: Yeah!

00:25.680 --> 00:28.400
Then five boys joined the party.

00:28.440 --> 00:31.240
They coupled up...

00:31.280 --> 00:33.880
but then came a twist.

00:33.920 --> 00:37.160
<font color="#FFFF00">In 24 hours, Adam will be coupled up</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">with one of your girls,</font>

00:37.200 --> 00:39.920
<font color="#FFFF00">leaving one of you single and</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">vulnerable.</font>

00:47.440 --> 00:49.440
Tonight...

00:52.000 --> 00:54.000
..there's trouble in paradise.

00:55.600 --> 00:58.400
<font color="#FFFF00">I don't wanna be a bad person.</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">I'm not a bad person.</font>

00:58.440 --> 01:00.240
<font color="#00FFFF">I just felt...</font>

01:00.280 --> 01:02.080
<font color="#00FFFF">uncomfortable.</font>

01:02.120 --> 01:05.760
<font color="#11FF11">It just proves to me that I</font>
<font color="#11FF11">always... Do you know what I mean?</font>

01:07.120 --> 01:09.120
<font color="#00FFFF">Interesting.</font>

01:10.600 --> 01:12.720
<font color="#FFFF00">I know what I want</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">and I get what I want.</font>

01:31.160 --> 01:36.320
Single boy Adam is preparing to steal
the girl of his choice.

01:36.360 --> 01:39.640
At the moment, the couples are...
Hayley and Eyal,

01:39.680 --> 01:41.240
Samira and Alex,

01:41.280 --> 01:43.080
Dani and Jack,

01:43.120 --> 01:44.520
Laura and Wes

01:44.560 --> 01:46.600
and Kendall and Niall.

01:46.640 --> 01:50.600
But like the buttons on Adam's shirt,
something's gotta give.

01:54.040 --> 01:56.800
<font color="#FFFF00">The decision</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">that I have sort of made</font>

01:56.840 --> 02:00.600
<font color="#FFFF00">is based on the chats I have had.</font>

02:00.640 --> 02:04.280
<font color="#FFFF00">I have tried to get to know</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">all of you one by one.</font>

02:04.320 --> 02:07.880
<font color="#FFFF00">The girl that I have decided to</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">couple up with,</font>

02:07.920 --> 02:10.880
<font color="#FFFF00">I think that the conversations</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">we've had, she's a good person,</font>

02:10.919 --> 02:13.880
<font color="#FFFF00">and she definitely ticks a lot of</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">boxes for me.</font>

02:13.920 --> 02:18.400
<font color="#FFFF00">So, the girl I want to couple up</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">with is...</font>

02:26.760 --> 02:28.760
<font color="#FFFF00">..Kendall.</font>

<font color="#00FFFF">Muggled?</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">Yeah, Harry Potter.</font>

03:24.600 --> 03:26.960
<font color="#00FFFF">I get it.</font>

03:27.000 --> 03:30.880
<font color="#11FF11">Oh, my God.</font>

03:37.040 --> 03:40.040
<font color="#00FFFF">It's tough. </font><font color="#FFFF00"> It is what it is, it's</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">what we're here to do.</font>

03:47.480 --> 03:49.840

04:00.360 --> 04:02.360
<font color="#FFFF00">Already?!</font>

04:05.720 --> 04:10.440
<font color="#00FFFF">You all right? </font><font color="#FFFF00"> Yeah, just shocked.</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">Like...</font>

04:10.480 --> 04:12.480
<font color="#FFFF00">I wasn't expecting that.</font>

04:12.520 --> 04:17.640
<font color="#FFFF00">You spoke to everybody before you</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">spoke to me.</font>

04:22.720 --> 04:25.120
<font color="#00FFFF">I saw it coming.</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">That's why I was prang.</font>

04:25.160 --> 04:27.440
<font color="#00FFFF">Everybody thought I was mad being</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">prang.</font>

04:27.480 --> 04:32.840
<font color="#00FFFF">There is madness to my prang.</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">Chill your boots. You're fine. Babe.</font>

04:32.880 --> 04:35.120
<font color="#11FF11">You're single and you're ready to</font>
<font color="#11FF11">mingle.</font>

04:35.160 --> 04:39.080
<font color="#00FFFF">I told everyone, a lad like that</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">with 15 abs, you don't trust him.</font>

04:39.120 --> 04:41.120
<font color="#00FFFF">And guess what? Who was right? Me.</font>

04:41.160 --> 04:45.320
<font color="#00FFFF">Everyone looking at me like I was</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">stupid. Deep down, obviously, like,</font>

04:45.360 --> 04:49.440
<font color="#00FFFF">I thought what me and Kendall had</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">was actually really good.</font>

04:49.480 --> 04:51.720
<font color="#00FFFF">My head is all over the gaffe</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">really.</font>

04:51.760 --> 04:54.160
<font color="#00FFFF">Yeah, no, honestly, it's sound.</font>

04:54.200 --> 04:57.960
<font color="#FFFF00">You sure? </font><font color="#00FFFF"> I ain't that kind of guy</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">that would be like...</font>

04:58.000 --> 05:01.440
<font color="#00FFFF">We ain't known each other long.</font>

05:01.480 --> 05:05.480
<font color="#FFFF00">I wasn't expecting it.</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">Honestly, it's sound.</font>

05:05.520 --> 05:08.920
<font color="#FFFF00">That's the furthest thing away from</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">what I thought he was gonna do.</font>

05:08.960 --> 05:11.440
<font color="#00FFFF">Honestly, it's sound.</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">Enjoy the date.</font>

05:11.480 --> 05:15.280
<font color="#00FFFF">Enjoy it, honestly. </font><font color="#FFFF00"> It's really</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">weird. </font><font color="#00FFFF"> Honestly.</font>

05:15.320 --> 05:22.320
<font color="#FFFF00">I was just so shocked that Adam</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">picked me.</font>

05:22.360 --> 05:26.440
<font color="#FFFF00">Like, no-one was expecting that.</font>

05:26.480 --> 05:30.000
<font color="#FFFF00">None of the girls were expecting</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">that, I wasn't expecting that.</font>

05:30.040 --> 05:32.440
<font color="#FFFF00">Like, why me?</font>

05:32.480 --> 05:37.320
<font color="#00FFFF">I got muggled off! Didn't even get</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">mugged off, muggled!</font>

05:37.360 --> 05:40.320
<font color="#11FF11">It was a muggling, unfortunately.</font>

05:40.360 --> 05:42.800
<font color="#00FFFF">It doesn't need to be</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">that big a deal.</font>

05:42.840 --> 05:44.640
<font color="#00FFFF">Obviously, it does feel like it,</font>

05:44.680 --> 05:47.880
<font color="#00FFFF">but just go and have a nice night</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">with him.</font>

05:47.920 --> 05:51.520
<font color="#FFFF00">Yeah. Are you OK? </font><font color="#00FFFF"> I'm absolutely</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">fine, babe.</font>

05:51.560 --> 05:56.560
<font color="#00FFFF">I think, maybe, fair to say,</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">I could be a little bit gutted</font>

05:56.600 --> 05:58.400
<font color="#00FFFF">Adam didn't choose me.</font>

05:58.440 --> 06:03.160
<font color="#00FFFF">And I felt really sorry</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">for Kendall and Niall.</font>

06:03.200 --> 06:05.200
<font color="#11FF11">The thing for me, the muggled off.</font>

06:05.240 --> 06:08.840
<font color="#FFFF00">Well, Voldemort is always drawn to</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">Harry Potter, so we might...</font>

06:08.880 --> 06:11.600
<font color="#11FF11">You just don't know where it goes.</font>

06:15.040 --> 06:17.680
<font color="#00FFFF">All right, boys. Big dog.</font>

06:17.720 --> 06:20.600
<font color="#00FFFF">Big dog stealing birds, is he?!</font>

06:20.640 --> 06:22.440
<font color="#00FFFF">Shock!</font>

06:22.480 --> 06:26.080
<font color="#00FFFF">No, honestly, it's cool. It's cool.</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">It's fine.</font>

06:26.120 --> 06:31.720
<font color="#00FFFF">I'm just pranging at the moment,</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">prang. Obviously...</font>

06:31.760 --> 06:34.960
<font color="#FFFF00">I was honest with you. You know?</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">I said to you straight away...</font>

06:35.000 --> 06:36.240
<font color="#00FFFF">I'm not a guy that's aggy.</font>

06:36.280 --> 06:39.080
<font color="#FFFF00">It's a game. You don't really want</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">to have to play a game,</font>

06:39.120 --> 06:42.400
<font color="#FFFF00">but you have got to do what you got</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">to do, especially in the Villa.</font>

06:42.440 --> 06:45.720
<font color="#FFFF00">It's Love Island. I know what</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">I want and I get what I want.</font>

06:45.760 --> 06:48.560
<font color="#FFFF00">I wanted her, I wanted Kendall.</font>

06:48.600 --> 06:53.080
<font color="#FFFF00">Mate, I was honest with you.</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">I can't not step on your toes.</font>

06:53.120 --> 06:56.000
<font color="#00FFFF">No, yeah. If you like her,</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">that's fine.</font>

06:56.040 --> 07:01.160
<font color="#00FFFF">You've got abs, yellow shorts.</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">I've got chat.</font>

07:01.200 --> 07:05.360
<font color="#00FFFF">I've got chat, and if you want</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">the chat, you can go, innit.</font>

07:05.400 --> 07:09.360
<font color="#00FFFF">That's it. Bad boy.</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">Bad boy.</font>

07:09.400 --> 07:12.120
<font color="#00FFFF">Goliath and David. Yellow shorts!</font>

07:16.600 --> 07:19.600
A relieved Jack has a big smile
on his face.

07:19.640 --> 07:22.240
If you run and look at your window
right now,

07:22.280 --> 07:23.880
you'll be able to see it.

07:23.920 --> 07:28.240
<font color="#00FFFF">I was worried, going, oh, my God,</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">he's talking to her.</font>

07:28.280 --> 07:32.200
<font color="#FFFF00">All that can happen from now is she</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">can mirror what you're doing.</font>

07:32.240 --> 07:35.640
<font color="#FFFF00">Then your bond will get stronger</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">and stronger and stronger.</font>

07:35.680 --> 07:38.280
<font color="#00FFFF">I reckon she thought that he was</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">gonna pick her as well.</font>

07:38.320 --> 07:41.120
<font color="#00FFFF">She must have thought it.</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">As soon as Adam said Kendall,</font>

07:41.160 --> 07:43.360
<font color="#00FFFF">I swear to God, the relief  that came</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">over me.</font>

07:43.400 --> 07:45.400
<font color="#00FFFF">I just felt so happy.</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">I felt so happy.</font>

07:45.440 --> 07:47.440
<font color="#00FFFF">I just thought to myself, right,</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">listen,</font>

07:47.480 --> 07:50.200
<font color="#00FFFF">now, I can crack on and proper get</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">to know her.</font>

07:50.240 --> 07:53.640
Niall's mum told us he eats a lot
when he stressed.

07:53.680 --> 07:57.840
He says he's fine, but I gave him
some pistachios just in case.

07:57.880 --> 08:00.520
<font color="#FFFF00">How are you feeling? </font><font color="#00FFFF"> I'm fine,</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">honestly.</font>

08:00.560 --> 08:04.040
<font color="#FFFF00">Obviously, he has a decision to make</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">and he has to choose a girl.</font>

08:04.080 --> 08:06.440
<font color="#FFFF00">But you know when you didn't think</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">he'd do it.</font>

08:06.480 --> 08:10.360
<font color="#FFFF00">She is happy with you.</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">I was like, that's mad.</font>

08:10.400 --> 08:13.080
<font color="#FFFF00">He said to me, I'm going to make</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">a fair decision.</font>

08:13.120 --> 08:17.840
<font color="#FFFF00">And I was like, that's... I don't</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">know if that's fair.</font>

08:17.880 --> 08:20.880
<font color="#00FFFF">No, it's sound. Honestly.</font>

08:20.920 --> 08:25.280
<font color="#FFFF00">You're gonna have a bit of ting with</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">him now? Like that much beef.</font>

08:25.320 --> 08:29.080
<font color="#00FFFF">There's no beef. </font><font color="#FFFF00"> No, but she does</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">like you.</font>

08:29.120 --> 08:31.720
<font color="#FFFF00">It's such a shame.</font>

08:33.400 --> 08:36.120
<font color="#11FF11">Are you OK? </font><font color="#00FFFF"> Yeah, yeah of course.</font>

08:36.159 --> 08:38.919
<font color="#00FFFF">I'm fine. Are you all right?</font>

08:44.920 --> 08:47.000
<font color="#11FF11">Have the best time.</font>

08:47.040 --> 08:50.040
<font color="#11FF11">Have a good time.</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">See you later.</font>

08:50.080 --> 08:53.040

<font color="#11FF11">hear...</font>

08:55.120 --> 08:57.720
<font color="#FFFF00">Have a good time. </font><font color="#11FF11"> Bye!</font>

08:57.760 --> 08:59.760
<font color="#00FFFF">We're jealous, we're jealous.</font>

08:59.800 --> 09:02.000
<font color="#FFFF00">I wish I was going.</font>

09:02.040 --> 09:03.840
(LAUGHTER)

09:03.880 --> 09:05.680

09:05.720 --> 09:07.280
(LAUGHTER)

09:15.600 --> 09:18.560
We've got a team working on the dates
this year.

09:18.600 --> 09:22.920
We told them we wanted this date to
scream Kendall.

09:22.960 --> 09:26.520
I think they might have misheard.

10:39.120 --> 10:43.120
<font color="#00FFFF">Like, you were the person that I</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">thought was my type. </font><font color="#FFFF00"> I still can't</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">believe that.</font>

10:43.160 --> 10:46.280
<font color="#00FFFF">I want to get to know you a little</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">bit better. That's why I picked you.</font>

10:46.320 --> 10:48.520
<font color="#00FFFF">Like I said, I can see us moving</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">forward,</font>

10:48.560 --> 10:51.280
<font color="#00FFFF">whereas, there were definitely</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">easier options,</font>

10:51.320 --> 10:55.720
<font color="#00FFFF">but I wouldn't want to pick</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">something that wasn't going to go</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">any further. </font><font color="#FFFF00"> Yeah.</font>

10:55.760 --> 10:57.360
<font color="#FFFF00">That's good.</font>

11:03.800 --> 11:09.480
Still to come, things turn sour for
Kendall.

11:09.520 --> 11:11.720
<font color="#FFFF00">I'm just</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">not used to this.</font>

11:19.280 --> 11:22.400
Niall's mum has told us
that when he is upset,

11:22.440 --> 11:25.160
he has a tendency to overuse the word
'like'.

11:25.200 --> 11:29.000
Niall's mum, don't worry,
I am sure he is absolutely fine.

11:29.040 --> 11:32.640
<font color="#FFFF00">I'll be honest with you, yeah.</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">It was a shock that he picked her.</font>

11:32.680 --> 11:38.600
<font color="#FFFF00">I was trying to give it the front</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">that I didn't care to save face.</font>

11:38.640 --> 11:42.400
<font color="#FFFF00">Like, I didn't say anything to her</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">before she went.</font>

11:42.440 --> 11:47.640
<font color="#FFFF00">Like, I didn't say, like...</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">Just a little bit sensitive.</font>

11:47.680 --> 11:50.440
<font color="#FFFF00">Like, 'I'll be waiting' or nothing.</font>

11:50.480 --> 11:52.760
<font color="#FFFF00">Just little things that we had in</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">common.</font>

11:52.800 --> 11:56.520
<font color="#00FFFF">He has been here the same amount of</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">time as you.</font>

11:56.560 --> 12:00.640
<font color="#00FFFF">Who has made the best connection</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">with her? </font><font color="#FFFF00"> Me and her.</font>

12:00.680 --> 12:03.600
<font color="#FFFF00">I do regret not pulling Kendall to</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">the side and saying,</font>

12:03.640 --> 12:05.920
<font color="#FFFF00">'I will still be here</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">when you get back.'</font>

12:05.960 --> 12:09.760
<font color="#FFFF00">But instead, being me, I ended up</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">trying to give it</font>

12:09.800 --> 12:11.520
<font color="#FFFF00">the fucking, 'I don't care.'</font>

12:11.560 --> 12:15.240
<font color="#FFFF00">I do actually like her and want</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">to get to know her more.</font>

12:15.280 --> 12:18.200
<font color="#FFFF00">He is Malfoy with a plus ten ab.</font>

12:18.240 --> 12:20.160
<font color="#FFFF00">I'm Harry Potter</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">with a bit of a tan.</font>

12:20.200 --> 12:24.320
<font color="#00FFFF">You've got a wand. </font><font color="#FFFF00"> Yeah, I've got</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">a wand. </font><font color="#00FFFF"> Go on then, do a Patronum.</font>

12:24.360 --> 12:27.440
<font color="#FFFF00">Patronum, I hope your fucking date</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">goes shit.</font>

12:27.480 --> 12:29.120
<font color="#00FFFF">(LAUGHS)</font>

12:34.320 --> 12:39.240
What colour are your eyes? <font color="#11FF11">They're,</font>
<font color="#11FF11">like, really blue. </font> Like, a really,
really nice blue.

12:39.280 --> 12:41.280
<font color="#11FF11">Oh, a nice blue? Oh, thanks.</font>

12:41.320 --> 12:44.240
Yeah, a really, really nice blue.
<font color="#11FF11">Thank you. </font> Lovely.

12:44.280 --> 12:48.280
<font color="#11FF11">What colour are yours? </font> I can't
decide. <font color="#11FF11">No, I can't decide.</font>

12:48.320 --> 12:52.400
<font color="#11FF11">They're like a...</font>
<font color="#11FF11">a really light brown.</font>

12:52.440 --> 12:54.440
<font color="#11FF11">But then, a dark green.</font>

12:54.480 --> 12:57.600
<font color="#11FF11">Mucky pondwater colour. </font> Mucky pond?

12:57.640 --> 13:00.520
Is that your chat-up line? <font color="#11FF11">(LAUGHS)</font>

13:00.560 --> 13:03.680
Do you think Niall will kick up
a fuss in the villa?

13:03.720 --> 13:05.960
If someone had come in and taken you
off me,

13:06.000 --> 13:08.600
I would feel a little bit shit about
myself.

13:08.640 --> 13:11.520
<font color="#11FF11">You know what, it's really hard.</font>
<font color="#11FF11">It's bittersweet.</font>

13:11.560 --> 13:13.840
<font color="#11FF11">Because, like, I'm not being</font>
<font color="#11FF11">funny...</font>

13:13.880 --> 13:15.880
<font color="#11FF11">You are, like, really attractive.</font>

13:15.920 --> 13:20.480
<font color="#11FF11">At the same time, I did actually get</font>
<font color="#11FF11">on with Niall. And you knew that.</font>

13:20.520 --> 13:23.240
<font color="#11FF11">Me and Niall clicked from, like,</font>
<font color="#11FF11">day one.</font>

13:23.280 --> 13:25.280
<font color="#00FFFF"># JAMES BAY: Wild Love</font>

13:28.000 --> 13:31.200
I'm just a bit scared that you might
go back there when we re-couple.

13:31.240 --> 13:35.040
<font color="#11FF11">Are you really? </font> Yeah. <font color="#11FF11"> I'm glad that</font>
<font color="#11FF11">you, like, took a risk, though.</font>

13:35.080 --> 13:37.080
<font color="#11FF11">(LAUGHS)</font>

13:37.120 --> 13:42.680
<font color="#11FF11">How do you feel about sharing a bed</font>
<font color="#11FF11">tonight?</font>

13:42.720 --> 13:46.080
I don't mind. Do you think you're
going to be a big spoon?

13:46.120 --> 13:51.200
<font color="#11FF11">I won't be any spoon. I'm not being</font>
<font color="#11FF11">big, medium, large... Nothing.</font>

13:51.240 --> 13:53.560
Why? What is wrong with that?

13:53.600 --> 13:57.120
<font color="#11FF11">Not on the first night that we have</font>
<font color="#11FF11">got to get in bed together.</font>

13:57.160 --> 13:58.840
What, a spoon?

13:58.880 --> 14:00.880
<font color="#11FF11">Spooning is a big commitment.</font>

14:00.920 --> 14:03.240
<font color="#11FF11">(LAUGHS)</font>

14:03.280 --> 14:07.280
How about if I gave you a kiss now
and then we don't have to spoon

14:07.320 --> 14:09.320
when we get back?

14:19.840 --> 14:21.840
Now he has got Dani all to himself,

14:21.880 --> 14:25.400
Jack is the happiest he has been
since he got an absolute bargain

14:25.440 --> 14:28.080
on a crate full of felt tip pens from
North Korea.

14:28.120 --> 14:32.440
<font color="#FFFF00">I just felt a little bit, like,</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">it would be a bit shit, if we...</font>

14:32.480 --> 14:37.480
<font color="#FFFF00">If I wasn't with you. </font><font color="#00FFFF"> It would be a</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">right shame. I'd have been gutted.</font>

14:37.520 --> 14:42.080
<font color="#FFFF00">(LAUGHS) </font><font color="#00FFFF"> Imagine how depressing</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">that would be, going back to the bed</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">on my own.</font>

14:42.120 --> 14:44.600
<font color="#FFFF00">I am genuinely happy. Today has been</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">intense, I think.</font>

14:44.640 --> 14:47.040
<font color="#FFFF00">Even with me and you. I don't want</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">you to think...</font>

14:47.080 --> 14:49.080
<font color="#FFFF00">I thought you were a bit weird.</font>

14:49.120 --> 14:52.760
<font color="#00FFFF">Did you think that? </font><font color="#FFFF00"> Yeah, I thought</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">you were weird and upset. Like...</font>

14:52.800 --> 14:54.920
<font color="#00FFFF">I wasn't.</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">A bit worried about things.</font>

14:54.960 --> 14:57.080
<font color="#FFFF00">I don't want you to be like that</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">with me.</font>

14:57.120 --> 15:00.000
<font color="#FFFF00">We can have a good time together.</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">That is what I want.</font>

15:00.040 --> 15:03.120
<font color="#00FFFF">I said I wanted to find someone</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">to  have a good time with.</font>

15:03.160 --> 15:06.040
<font color="#00FFFF">I have not said I want to come here</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">banging birds...</font>

15:06.080 --> 15:08.080
<font color="#00FFFF">I want to have a laugh with you.</font>

15:08.120 --> 15:11.520
<font color="#FFFF00">I am not gutted at all at the minute</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">that Adam didn't choose me.</font>

15:11.560 --> 15:13.560
<font color="#FFFF00">I am happy at the minute with Jack.</font>

15:13.600 --> 15:16.920
<font color="#FFFF00">We're really getting on. I am</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">enjoying his company.</font>

15:16.960 --> 15:18.960
<font color="#FFFF00">I would rather have that</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">at the minute</font>

15:19.000 --> 15:21.000
<font color="#FFFF00">than jumping to something else.</font>

15:21.040 --> 15:25.040
<font color="#FFFF00">To me, to open up and get to know</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">someone, it takes me a little time.</font>

15:25.080 --> 15:28.480
<font color="#FFFF00">It's nice to have that at the minute</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">with Jack.</font>

15:28.520 --> 15:31.320
Dani and Jack are not the only ones
enjoying a chat.

15:31.360 --> 15:35.680
Hayley and Eyal or, as I now call
them...Hey Y'all.

15:35.720 --> 15:38.480
<font color="#11FF11">What a day. </font><font color="#FFFF00"> Literally, what a day.</font>

15:38.520 --> 15:40.120
<font color="#11FF11">It has been a long day.</font>

15:40.160 --> 15:44.320
<font color="#FFFF00">Do you know what's so weird?</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">You see what can happen in a day.</font>

15:44.360 --> 15:47.560
<font color="#11FF11">Yeah. </font><font color="#FFFF00"> Every time we recouple,</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">things are going to change.</font>

15:48.040 --> 15:49.640
<font color="#FFFF00">That's scary.</font>

15:49.680 --> 15:54.000
<font color="#11FF11">I know, it's pretty mad. It could</font>
<font color="#11FF11">have all changed.</font>

15:54.040 --> 15:57.400
<font color="#11FF11">But it didn't. </font><font color="#FFFF00"> What do you mean?</font>

15:59.480 --> 16:01.560
<font color="#11FF11">It could have all changed.</font>

16:01.600 --> 16:04.600
<font color="#11FF11">You could be on a date</font>
<font color="#11FF11">and I could be Niall.</font>

16:04.640 --> 16:10.520
<font color="#FFFF00">Adam seems like a really nice lad.</font>
<font color="#11FF11">I agree.</font>

16:10.560 --> 16:14.400
<font color="#11FF11">Yeah, I just didn't want to get</font>
<font color="#11FF11">too close to him. </font><font color="#FFFF00"> Why?</font>

16:14.440 --> 16:18.680
<font color="#11FF11">I dunno. I just assumed that</font>
<font color="#11FF11">he would want to go with you.</font>

16:18.720 --> 16:20.720
<font color="#FFFF00">I haven't spoken to him.</font>

16:20.760 --> 16:25.760
<font color="#11FF11">No, but, this is still a game.</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">Is it a game?</font>

16:25.800 --> 16:28.160
<font color="#FFFF00">I thought you didn't have</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">a game plan.</font>

16:28.200 --> 16:30.800
<font color="#FFFF00">So why are you saying it's a game?</font>

16:30.840 --> 16:34.560
<font color="#11FF11">Because this whole thing is made to</font>
<font color="#11FF11">be a game.</font>

16:34.600 --> 16:42.280
<font color="#FFFF00">It's not a game. It's only a game</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">if you want to be a game. </font><font color="#11FF11"> OK. Fairs.</font>

16:42.320 --> 16:44.320
<font color="#FFFF00">Yeah? So, you're playing a game?</font>

16:44.360 --> 16:46.360
<font color="#11FF11">No, what game am I playing?</font>

16:46.520 --> 16:48.600
<font color="#FFFF00">You just said it's a game.</font>

16:48.640 --> 16:51.400
<font color="#FFFF00">Why would you have to reassure</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">someone what a game plan is,</font>

16:51.440 --> 16:53.320
<font color="#FFFF00">if you haven't got a game plan?</font>

16:53.360 --> 16:57.320
<font color="#FFFF00">It fucking baffles me.</font>
<font color="#11FF11">This is a game.</font>

17:01.640 --> 17:06.200
<font color="#11FF11">But I am going with what I feel,</font>
<font color="#11FF11">at that time. 100%.</font>

17:06.240 --> 17:08.520
<font color="#FFFF00">At that time? So it could change</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">tomorrow?</font>

17:08.560 --> 17:13.560
<font color="#11FF11">Like it could with you.</font>
<font color="#11FF11">We don't know.</font>

17:16.280 --> 17:18.680
<font color="#FFFF00">Interesting.</font>

17:18.720 --> 17:24.119
<font color="#11FF11">She slightly misinterpreted what</font>
<font color="#11FF11">I said or maybe I worded it wrong.</font>

17:24.160 --> 17:30.040
<font color="#11FF11">I dunno. Something didn't quite go</font>
<font color="#11FF11">to plan.</font>

17:30.080 --> 17:34.760
<font color="#11FF11">I don't know how you have spun</font>
<font color="#11FF11">this  around on me.</font>

17:37.880 --> 17:39.880
<font color="#11FF11">I haven't worked you out.</font>

17:39.920 --> 17:43.320
<font color="#FFFF00">That's good then, isn't it?</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">It's 'a game'.</font>

17:43.360 --> 17:47.400
<font color="#11FF11">No, that's not fair.</font>

17:49.720 --> 17:52.400
<font color="#FFFF00">I was fucking pissed off,</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">to tell you the truth.</font>

17:52.440 --> 17:54.200
<font color="#FFFF00">Do you know I mean? I was just like,</font>

17:54.240 --> 17:56.520
<font color="#FFFF00">'I don't even fucking want to speak</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">to you.'</font>

17:56.560 --> 17:58.960
<font color="#FFFF00">Like, fuck off, literally.</font>

18:02.240 --> 18:04.640
Kendall and Adam are back
from their date.

18:04.680 --> 18:07.400
You enjoy the fallout,
while I go out and blow out

18:07.440 --> 18:09.440
these bloody Ken dolls... Candles!

18:09.480 --> 18:14.200
<font color="#11FF11">The date went really well, actually.</font>
<font color="#11FF11">I felt really comfortable with him.</font>

18:14.240 --> 18:18.760
<font color="#11FF11">Obviously, like, I am attracted</font>
<font color="#11FF11">to him. He is very easy on the eye.</font>

18:18.800 --> 18:22.360
<font color="#00FFFF">All right? </font><font color="#11FF11"> Hi!</font>

18:22.400 --> 18:25.720
<font color="#FFFF00">Let's get the gossip!</font>

18:25.760 --> 18:27.960
<font color="#11FF11">It was really nice.</font>

18:28.000 --> 18:30.000
<font color="#00FFFF">Did you eat? </font> Yeah.

18:30.040 --> 18:33.360
<font color="#11FF11">Guess what we ate!</font>
Aioli. Swear to God.

18:33.400 --> 18:39.040
<font color="#11FF11">It was really nice. It was nicer</font>
<font color="#11FF11">than I expected.</font>

18:39.080 --> 18:43.480
<font color="#FFFF00">Do you feel, like, you like him</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">a bit more now?</font>

18:43.520 --> 18:47.920
<font color="#FFFF00">Like, how do you think you feel,</font>

18:47.960 --> 18:52.200
<font color="#FFFF00">since before you went on the date</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">to after the date?</font>

18:54.400 --> 18:56.040
Yeah, I would.

19:05.440 --> 19:08.640
<font color="#FFFF00">How do you feel? </font><font color="#11FF11"> It was really</font>
<font color="#11FF11">nice. It was.</font>

19:08.680 --> 19:15.960
<font color="#11FF11">It was dead comfortable. He was</font>
<font color="#11FF11">a real, like, gentleman.</font>

19:16.000 --> 19:19.200
<font color="#FFFF00">How do you feel</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">now you've come back?</font>

19:21.200 --> 19:22.800
<font color="#11FF11">I am quite happy.</font>

19:22.840 --> 19:28.480
<font color="#11FF11">I'm still a bit in denial.</font>
<font color="#11FF11">It's too good to be true.</font>

19:28.520 --> 19:31.640
<font color="#FFFF00">There is Niall and Adam</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">in front of you.</font>

19:31.680 --> 19:34.560
<font color="#11FF11">Right, OK. </font><font color="#FFFF00"> If you had the choice,</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">who would you go for?</font>

19:34.600 --> 19:40.200
<font color="#11FF11">So, Niall. The chat with Niall.</font>
<font color="#11FF11">We get on, like...</font>

19:40.240 --> 19:46.240
<font color="#11FF11">You wouldn't believe.</font>
<font color="#11FF11">He is...so energetic.</font>

19:46.280 --> 19:48.120
<font color="#11FF11">We just clicked.</font>

19:48.160 --> 19:50.720
<font color="#11FF11">Then, I feel like Adam, maybe...</font>

19:50.760 --> 19:54.640
<font color="#11FF11">Sort of, too good to be true.</font>

19:54.680 --> 20:01.000
<font color="#11FF11">Literally, you've got Niall,</font>
<font color="#11FF11">who is an absolute dream.</font>

20:01.040 --> 20:03.040
<font color="#11FF11">He is so funny.</font>

20:03.080 --> 20:06.560
<font color="#11FF11">And then you have got Adam, who has</font>
<font color="#11FF11">made me feel so comfortable.</font>

20:06.600 --> 20:12.000
<font color="#11FF11">I'm not used to this. I feel like</font>
<font color="#11FF11">I'm so out of my depth.</font>

20:13.920 --> 20:16.240
<font color="#00FFFF">So, what are you saying?</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">What was it like?</font>

20:16.280 --> 20:19.640
The date was sound.

20:19.680 --> 20:22.080
It was good. Really good.

20:22.120 --> 20:24.640
<font color="#00FFFF">Sick chat? </font> Yeah, decent, mate.

20:24.680 --> 20:30.480
We had a lot of chat and, I think,
things will move on from this.

20:30.520 --> 20:33.920
Obviously, sharing a bed tonight
with Kendall is going to be

20:33.960 --> 20:37.560
a little bit better than sleeping by
myself, I'm not going to lie.

20:37.600 --> 20:40.680
Nice to have someone that looks as
good as her by my side.

20:40.720 --> 20:42.520
Do I feel for Niall? Yeah.

20:42.560 --> 20:46.240
Would anyone want to lose Kendall
staying in your bed every night?

20:46.280 --> 20:49.760
Definitely not. So, I mean, she's
going to be a miss for the boy.

20:49.800 --> 20:51.800
But it is what it is.

20:53.400 --> 20:55.960
<font color="#FFFF00">How is everyone?</font>
<font color="#11FF11">Hey, you all right?</font>

20:56.000 --> 20:59.560
<font color="#FFFF00">How was your date?</font>
<font color="#11FF11">Yeah, it was nice.</font>

20:59.600 --> 21:04.440
<font color="#FFFF00">Heard you had aioli... </font><font color="#11FF11"> We had</font>
<font color="#11FF11">al-ali... However you say it.</font>

21:04.480 --> 21:07.000
<font color="#FFFF00">I don't even know what it is.</font>
<font color="#11FF11">Yeah.</font>

21:07.040 --> 21:09.040
<font color="#00FFFF">See you laters.</font>

21:09.080 --> 21:11.640
<font color="#11FF11">OK, see you later...</font>

21:11.680 --> 21:15.280
<font color="#11FF11">How you feeling? </font><font color="#FFFF00"> Me? </font><font color="#11FF11"> Yeah.</font>

21:15.320 --> 21:19.160
<font color="#FFFF00">I was just kind of, like,</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">make a big joke out of it.</font>

21:19.200 --> 21:23.280
<font color="#FFFF00">Like, 'I don't care.'</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">Trying to be like that.</font>

21:23.320 --> 21:25.680
<font color="#FFFF00">Obviously, I'll be honest, I did.</font>

21:25.720 --> 21:28.640
<font color="#11FF11">Oh, don't say stuff like that. </font><font color="#FFFF00"> No...</font>

21:28.680 --> 21:32.080
<font color="#11FF11">That hurts.</font>

21:32.120 --> 21:36.440
<font color="#FFFF00">I think that I just need to, like,</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">stop acting, like,</font>

21:36.480 --> 21:39.680
<font color="#FFFF00">Billy Big-Bollocks, like I don't</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">care, with Kendall.</font>

21:39.720 --> 21:41.920
<font color="#FFFF00">Lay it on the line</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">how I actually do feel.</font>

21:41.960 --> 21:44.360
<font color="#FFFF00">I actually do think</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">she's a really good girl.</font>

21:44.400 --> 21:49.240
<font color="#FFFF00">I genuinely think, for the short</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">time I've been here, we do seem</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">to really click.</font>

21:49.280 --> 21:52.920
<font color="#FFFF00">I am not blind. He looks like</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">a fucking Greek God.</font>

21:52.960 --> 21:55.560
<font color="#11FF11">You look like a Greek God. Shut up.</font>

21:55.600 --> 22:01.160
<font color="#FFFF00">No, he looks like fucking Zeus...</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">shagged Angelina Jolie.</font>

22:01.200 --> 22:03.200
<font color="#FFFF00">He looks like their love child.</font>

22:03.240 --> 22:07.040
<font color="#FFFF00">He likes aioli. </font><font color="#11FF11"> It's hard to compare</font>
<font color="#11FF11">you.</font>

22:07.080 --> 22:09.960
<font color="#11FF11">You are just two completely</font>
<font color="#11FF11">different people.</font>

22:10.000 --> 22:12.960
<font color="#FFFF00">I still want to get to know you.</font>
<font color="#11FF11">Yeah.</font>

22:13.000 --> 22:14.800
<font color="#FFFF00">I don't how you feel...</font>

22:14.840 --> 22:19.200
<font color="#11FF11">(SIGHS) </font><font color="#FFFF00"> About everything.</font>

22:19.240 --> 22:22.200
<font color="#11FF11">Honestly, yeah. My head...</font>

22:22.240 --> 22:26.280
<font color="#11FF11">It's literally all over the place.</font>
<font color="#11FF11">I don't know.</font>

22:26.320 --> 22:28.200
<font color="#FFFF00">It's chalk and cheese. </font><font color="#11FF11"> Isn't it?</font>

22:28.240 --> 22:31.400
<font color="#11FF11">You are two completely different</font>
<font color="#11FF11">people.</font>

22:31.440 --> 22:34.520
<font color="#11FF11">I think, if I could merge you</font>
<font color="#11FF11">together... But no.</font>

22:34.560 --> 22:41.640
<font color="#FFFF00">You have got to see how you feel...</font>
<font color="#11FF11">See how things go.</font>

22:41.680 --> 22:44.800
<font color="#FFFF00">What she said has made me question</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">everything.</font>

22:44.840 --> 22:48.400
<font color="#FFFF00">When someone is saying to me,</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">'I would like to mesh you.'</font>

22:48.440 --> 22:51.240
<font color="#FFFF00">I just think that is such a muggy</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">thing to say.</font>

22:58.480 --> 23:02.320
<font color="#FFFF00">Sounds bad, but I think she wishes</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">my personality was in him.</font>

23:02.360 --> 23:05.240
<font color="#FFFF00">Which is a bit of fucking muggle</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">statement.</font>

23:05.280 --> 23:09.080
<font color="#FFFF00">I ain't a bad-looking lad. He is</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">just too fucking good-looking.</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">It's a bit weird.</font>

23:09.120 --> 23:11.520
<font color="#FFFF00">He doesn't even look real.</font>

23:11.560 --> 23:16.560
<font color="#00FFFF">It's only because this is the second</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">guy you have dated.</font>

23:16.600 --> 23:19.600
<font color="#00FFFF">That is literally it. I promise.</font>

23:19.640 --> 23:23.680
<font color="#11FF11">I wasn't expecting Adam to pick me.</font>

23:23.720 --> 23:28.040
<font color="#11FF11">And then, I wasn't expecting</font>
<font color="#11FF11">to go on a date with him.</font>

23:28.080 --> 23:29.880
<font color="#11FF11">That was out of the blue.</font>

23:29.920 --> 23:33.640
<font color="#11FF11">And then, I wasn't expecting</font>
<font color="#11FF11">to have a nice date.</font>

23:37.840 --> 23:43.880
<font color="#00FFFF">LAURA: He has chosen you. He has</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">chosen you. We are all besties.</font>

23:43.920 --> 23:45.920
<font color="#00FFFF">Don't get upset.</font>

23:45.960 --> 23:49.680
<font color="#11FF11">What is wrong with me? </font> It's because
it is so fresh, I'm telling you.

23:49.720 --> 23:53.400
<font color="#00FFFF">You are a loyal girl. You feel</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">awkward and we get it. </font><font color="#11FF11"> OK.</font>

23:53.440 --> 23:56.440
<font color="#11FF11">He is such a lovely person.</font>

23:56.480 --> 24:01.120
<font color="#11FF11">It makes it so much harder.</font>
<font color="#11FF11">I'm thinking...</font>

24:01.160 --> 24:05.000
<font color="#11FF11">too much about</font>
<font color="#11FF11">how I'm making him feel.</font>

24:05.040 --> 24:08.040
<font color="#11FF11">I'm just not used to this.</font>

24:09.640 --> 24:11.640
<font color="#00FFFF"># SYML: Where's My Love?</font>

24:23.000 --> 24:25.920
<font color="#FFFF00">You're doing the look.</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">I know you're doing the look.</font>

24:25.960 --> 24:28.280
<font color="#00FFFF">What look? </font><font color="#FFFF00"> The look.</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">What does that mean?</font>

24:28.320 --> 24:31.800
<font color="#00FFFF">For what? </font><font color="#FFFF00"> The trying to get</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">hold of me look.</font>

25:16.720 --> 25:19.520
The islanders
get tongue-tied.

25:30.840 --> 25:33.680
It is the morning
after Adam's date,

25:33.720 --> 25:38.560
where he was seduced by the
irresistible charms of aioli.

25:38.600 --> 25:43.560
With Kendall in Adam's bed, her
relationship with Niall is on pause.

25:43.600 --> 25:46.920
Talking of pause...
Wes' paws are all over Laura.

26:25.360 --> 26:29.040
<font color="#FFFF00">I am all right in the night.</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">If Jack smiles, I can see!</font>

26:39.520 --> 26:43.600
In the kitchen, Alex is looking for
the skinny on Adam and Kendall.

26:43.640 --> 26:47.640
Adam is looking for the jar of aioli
he had in the fridge.

26:47.680 --> 26:49.680
<font color="#FFFF00">Are you buzzing?</font>

26:49.720 --> 26:59.400
It was nice to speak to her
and be in bed with her.

26:59.440 --> 27:04.680
<font color="#FFFF00">One-on-one.</font>
Kendall is super nice.

27:04.720 --> 27:07.200
I like how down-to-earth she is.

27:07.240 --> 27:12.560
That is definitely the main thing.
She's not what I expected.

27:12.600 --> 27:15.240
I didn't think
when she looks that good,

27:15.280 --> 27:17.560
that she could be so down to earth.

27:17.600 --> 27:20.480
I think she's feeling tense
after last night.

27:20.520 --> 27:22.520
I think it will be fine by tonight.

27:22.560 --> 27:29.520
<font color="#FFFF00">For her, she feels bad for Niall.</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">That will quickly...</font>

27:29.560 --> 27:34.400
<font color="#FFFF00">He is fine. We will see what</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">happens. It is still early days.</font>

27:34.440 --> 27:41.240
Kendall's perfect man is
a combination of Adam's face,

27:41.280 --> 27:45.840
Adam's abs, Adam's chest,
Niall's personality...

27:45.880 --> 27:48.240
And Niall's annoyed.

27:48.280 --> 27:56.000
<font color="#FFFF00">She said combine us and it'll be</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">perfect...</font>

27:56.040 --> 28:01.800
<font color="#FFFF00">Hang on. Give me a second.</font>

28:01.840 --> 28:08.400
<font color="#FFFF00">If I say to a girl I would like</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">to put your personality in</font>

28:08.440 --> 28:12.080
<font color="#FFFF00">another girl, it would be out of</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">order.</font>

28:12.120 --> 28:20.080
<font color="#FFFF00">It is so muggy. I said from day dot,</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">I am an investment piece.</font>

28:20.120 --> 28:24.640
<font color="#00FFFF">You should always be you and that</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">should be enough. </font><font color="#FFFF00"> Exactly.</font>

28:24.680 --> 28:27.280
<font color="#00FFFF">In here, it makes your head fucked.</font>

28:33.080 --> 28:35.880
Samira has had some time to really
get to know Alex.

28:35.920 --> 28:40.960
How does she feel about him now?
<font color="#00FFFF">I don't know. It's so awkward.</font>

28:41.000 --> 28:44.920
<font color="#00FFFF">I don't want to.</font>

28:53.160 --> 28:56.080
<font color="#00FFFF">With Alex, I just feel so awkward.</font>

28:56.120 --> 28:59.120
<font color="#00FFFF">We just don't have any connection.</font>

28:59.160 --> 29:01.840
<font color="#00FFFF">I don't know what Alex is thinking</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">about me.</font>

29:01.880 --> 29:06.320
<font color="#00FFFF">He probably thinks I am a bitch.</font>

29:06.360 --> 29:09.240
Poor Alex, Samira hasn't given him
anything.

29:09.280 --> 29:12.640
A smile cost nothing,
unless you are Jack.

29:12.680 --> 29:15.520
Then it is £7,000 a tooth.

29:15.560 --> 29:21.280
<font color="#FFFF00">I am frustrated.</font>

29:21.320 --> 29:27.960
<font color="#FFFF00">It is awkward and difficult.</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">She's not letting the barriers down.</font>

29:28.000 --> 29:30.880
<font color="#FFFF00">To see if I've got something she</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">could connect with.</font>

29:30.920 --> 29:37.400
<font color="#11FF11">If she is not going to give you</font>
<font color="#11FF11">a chance, it is pointless.</font>

29:37.440 --> 29:42.560
<font color="#FFFF00">I have made a lot of effort</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">to chat to her. At least,</font>

29:42.600 --> 29:45.040
<font color="#FFFF00">make some kind of civil</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">conversation.</font>

29:45.080 --> 29:48.200
<font color="#FFFF00">She's not really interested</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">in making any effort.</font>

29:48.240 --> 29:52.120
<font color="#FFFF00">I am just going to move on and stop</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">making any effort in that way.</font>

29:52.160 --> 29:56.160
<font color="#FFFF00">Still be friendly and civil.</font>

29:56.200 --> 29:57.800
<font color="#11FF11">Niall...</font>

29:57.840 --> 30:00.320
Kendall is going for a heart-to-heart
with Niall.

30:00.360 --> 30:03.280
She would prefer Adam's heart,
but she will make do.

30:03.320 --> 30:15.480
<font color="#11FF11">I'm all right. Are you? </font><font color="#FFFF00"> Yeah,</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">I'm good. </font><font color="#11FF11"> How are you feeling?</font>

30:15.520 --> 30:26.800
<font color="#FFFF00">Obviously, yeah, it isn't the best.</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">Obviously. Not the best day for me.</font>

30:26.840 --> 30:30.840
<font color="#FFFF00">I thought... We clicked.</font>

30:30.880 --> 30:40.920
<font color="#FFFF00">For me, when you were like,</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">if I could combine you two...</font>

30:40.960 --> 30:44.920
<font color="#FFFF00">The way I took it was if you could</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">put my personality in him.</font>

30:44.960 --> 30:47.920
<font color="#11FF11">Oh my God, no. Not like that at all.</font>

30:47.960 --> 30:53.760
<font color="#11FF11">I meant because he was so serious</font>
<font color="#11FF11">conversation-wise.</font>

30:53.800 --> 31:00.880
<font color="#FFFF00">Got the fucking aioli out</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">and so serious, sounds a hoot.</font>

31:00.920 --> 31:08.880
<font color="#11FF11">I wanted to get to know you deeper.</font>

31:08.920 --> 31:19.360
<font color="#FFFF00">I said to you, I opened up to you.</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">I have got layers. A massive coating</font>

31:19.400 --> 31:23.200
<font color="#FFFF00">of my layer is that I back myself</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">and I know my worth.</font>

31:23.240 --> 31:26.120
<font color="#FFFF00">I am not someone who...</font>

31:26.160 --> 31:29.960
<font color="#FFFF00">If I didn't have that, the whole</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">thing could get absolutely fucked.</font>

31:30.000 --> 31:34.440
<font color="#11FF11">I'm really sorry. </font><font color="#FFFF00"> No, don't.</font>

31:34.480 --> 31:38.400
<font color="#11FF11">I would never mean to make you feel</font>
<font color="#11FF11">like that. </font><font color="#FFFF00"> No, no.</font>

31:38.440 --> 31:43.600
<font color="#11FF11">I'm not a malicious person.</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">Don't cry.</font>

31:43.640 --> 31:54.040
<font color="#FFFF00">Don't get upset. I feel bad now.</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">It's fine, don't worry about it.</font>

31:54.080 --> 31:55.680
<font color="#FFFF00">Sound.</font>

31:55.720 --> 32:01.800
<font color="#11FF11">Just a little bit confused.</font>

32:01.840 --> 32:07.080
<font color="#11FF11">I do want to have a conversation</font>
<font color="#11FF11">with Niall. I do enjoy his company.</font>

32:07.120 --> 32:10.840
<font color="#11FF11">I feel like Adam is really</font>
<font color="#11FF11">considerate.</font>

32:10.880 --> 32:12.880
<font color="#11FF11">He's very mature for his age.</font>

32:12.920 --> 32:17.800
<font color="#11FF11">I'm all right. I'll be fine.</font>

32:17.840 --> 32:24.840
In a couple of days, it will be fine.
It is the same for me, as well.

32:24.880 --> 32:31.200
<font color="#11FF11">Yeah. </font> I'm not a bad person.
<font color="#11FF11">I feel like a bad person.</font>

32:31.240 --> 32:34.360
After last night when everything was
in uproar,

32:34.400 --> 32:36.760
I'm trying to give her a bit of space

32:36.800 --> 32:39.320
and have a couple of chats
when I can,

32:39.360 --> 32:41.840
when I can get get her by herself.

32:41.880 --> 32:44.480
Everyone forgets stuff
dead quick in here.

32:44.520 --> 32:49.080
Once the other islanders start
not looking at me

32:49.120 --> 32:54.120
and her as much, it will help,
so we can move forward.

32:58.200 --> 33:00.920
After an emotional first day,

33:00.960 --> 33:04.960
the islanders need a moment to sit
back and relax.

33:05.000 --> 33:08.400
Luckily, their contract says we don't
need to give them one.

33:08.440 --> 33:10.040
(TEXT ALERT)

33:10.080 --> 33:12.040
<font color="#00FFFF">I got a text!</font>

33:30.520 --> 33:39.520
<font color="#FFFF00">Ooh! </font><font color="#00FFFF"> Interesting! </font><font color="#FFFF00"> I'm like, what</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">have I done? </font><font color="#11FF11"> Shit, man.</font>

33:51.440 --> 33:53.760
The girls and boys are going
head-to-head

33:53.800 --> 33:56.280
in a game called Excess Baggage.

33:58.680 --> 34:00.120
The girls are up first.

34:00.160 --> 34:06.800
One at a time, suitcases will come
down onto a baggage carousel.

34:08.480 --> 34:11.280
<font color="#FFFF00">Oh my God. It is real money.</font>

34:11.320 --> 34:15.080
Inside each case is a saucy secret
about one of the boys.

34:15.120 --> 34:21.719
<font color="#FFFF00">This boy once spent £1,000</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">on a first date. </font><font color="#11FF11"> (ALL GASP)</font>

34:21.760 --> 34:28.679
The girls have to guess
who it is about.

34:28.719 --> 34:32.880
<font color="#00FFFF">Do it.</font>

34:32.920 --> 34:35.719
The chosen girl must then snog
that boy.

34:35.760 --> 34:43.440
And, BAFTA, you can't have it back.
<font color="#FFFF00">Wes!</font>

34:43.480 --> 34:53.920
<font color="#00FFFF">I saw her eyes light up when it was</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">revealed it was my name.</font>

34:58.200 --> 35:03.040
<font color="#11FF11">What the hell? Maracas?</font>

35:03.080 --> 35:10.120
<font color="#11FF11">This boy once used a musical</font>
<font color="#11FF11">instrument as a sex toy.</font>

35:12.200 --> 35:17.760
<font color="#FFFF00">What the fuck? </font><font color="#00FFFF"> Who is dirty?</font>

35:29.280 --> 35:37.120
<font color="#FFFF00">I am not jealous. I just felt...</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">Uncomfortable. </font><font color="#11FF11"> Niall!</font>

35:37.160 --> 35:40.000
<font color="#00FFFF">Of course. </font><font color="#FFFF00"> A recorder!</font>

35:40.040 --> 35:46.640
<font color="#00FFFF">As soon as we found out it was him,</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">we were like, of course.</font>

35:46.680 --> 35:49.720
<font color="#00FFFF">Poor girl.</font>

35:49.760 --> 35:53.520
<font color="#11FF11">This boy has had his threesome</font>
<font color="#11FF11">with his friend and a girl.</font>

35:58.920 --> 36:04.480
<font color="#00FFFF">(ALL SCREAM) It was brutal.</font>

36:04.520 --> 36:06.840
<font color="#11FF11">Alex.</font>

36:10.800 --> 36:16.960
<font color="#FFFF00">I couldn't see it. Where did this</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">happen? The hospital?</font>

36:17.000 --> 36:24.240
<font color="#00FFFF">The other islanders see me as Alex</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">the doctor. </font><font color="#11FF11"> That is well unexpected!</font>

36:24.280 --> 36:28.080
<font color="#00FFFF">Maybe that has made them realise</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">there is another side to me.</font>

36:28.120 --> 36:30.200
<font color="#00FFFF">I am a normal guy</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">like everyone else.</font>

36:33.280 --> 36:37.400
<font color="#FFFF00">This boy says he has cheated on all</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">of his previous girlfriend.</font>

36:39.960 --> 36:44.120
<font color="#FFFF00">I mean... </font> It was pretty savage.

36:48.200 --> 36:50.040
<font color="#11FF11">Jack!</font>

36:50.080 --> 36:51.680
<font color="#FFFF00">On all their girlfriends!</font>

36:51.720 --> 36:53.720
<font color="#00FFFF">I've only had two.</font>

36:53.760 --> 37:03.760
<font color="#00FFFF">Everyone was like, ooh, as if I have</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">had 30 girlfriends and a wife.</font>

37:03.800 --> 37:10.040
<font color="#FFFF00">I was a bit disappointed.</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">His  reaction was a bit shit.</font>

37:10.080 --> 37:13.920
<font color="#FFFF00">It was only two? I would be mad</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">if it was one!</font>

37:13.960 --> 37:24.240
Will the boys be able to beat zero?

37:29.560 --> 37:32.760
<font color="#00FFFF">This girl has only ever slept with</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">one person.</font>

37:32.800 --> 37:34.800
<font color="#00FFFF">You all look very innocent.</font>

37:39.600 --> 37:44.720
It looks like it will be staying that
way for the foreseeable future.

37:44.760 --> 37:53.440
<font color="#00FFFF">She just kind of panicked. </font><font color="#FFFF00"> I find it</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">a bit awkward with Alex.</font>

37:53.480 --> 37:56.440
<font color="#FFFF00">It might be because he has got</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">a professional job.</font>

37:56.480 --> 37:59.080
<font color="#00FFFF">Hayley.</font>

37:59.120 --> 38:03.120
Poor old Alex. He did get it right.

38:03.160 --> 38:07.400
So, the boys have basically won, so
they can snog whoever they want.

38:07.440 --> 38:11.120
<font color="#FFFF00">This girl had a threesome that only</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">lasted three minutes.</font>

38:23.280 --> 38:28.120
<font color="#FFFF00">Samira. Come on.</font>

38:28.160 --> 38:31.120
This girl is a member of
the mile-high club.

38:38.360 --> 38:41.520
<font color="#00FFFF">It was obvious that it was Laura,</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">but I wanted to kiss Dani.</font>

38:41.560 --> 38:44.360
<font color="#00FFFF">To make up for the fact that she</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">found out I've cheated.</font>

38:44.400 --> 38:50.000
<font color="#FFFF00">Laura. </font><font color="#11FF11"> I was a passenger</font>
<font color="#11FF11">with my boyfriend.</font>

38:51.160 --> 38:54.960
<font color="#FFFF00">This girl claims to have dated</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">a well-known Hollywood movie star.</font>

38:55.000 --> 38:57.800
<font color="#00FFFF">Shut up.</font>

39:01.600 --> 39:03.600
<font color="#00FFFF">(ALL SCREAM)</font>

39:09.360 --> 39:16.480
<font color="#FFFF00">It is Samira. </font><font color="#00FFFF"> Who was it?</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">Chris Pine.</font>

39:16.520 --> 39:19.640
<font color="#11FF11">Oh, my God.</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">You've been shagging Spock!</font>

39:22.240 --> 39:28.640
<font color="#FFFF00">This girl can't remember the names</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">of all the people she has slept</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">with.</font>

39:37.000 --> 39:43.560
<font color="#FFFF00">That challenge was tongue-alicious.</font>

39:43.600 --> 39:50.960
I wasn't surprised. I would do
the same. He is definitely going
to keep trying.

39:52.080 --> 39:57.760
<font color="#FFFF00">Kendall!</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">It was someone on holiday.</font>

40:00.160 --> 40:03.600
<font color="#11FF11">Three points to the boys, which</font>
<font color="#11FF11">means they have won.</font>

40:08.400 --> 40:11.960
Still to come...Alex is on the edge.

40:12.000 --> 40:15.320
<font color="#FFFF00">I have had enough.</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">I'm at that point.</font>

40:21.000 --> 40:25.440
The Excess Baggage challenge is over
and the biggest revelation

40:25.480 --> 40:28.480
was that Niall has finally found
a use for a recorder.

40:28.520 --> 40:32.520
Alex is worried that three won't be
a magic number.

40:32.560 --> 40:37.120
<font color="#FFFF00">What do you think</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">the girls will say?</font>

40:37.160 --> 40:40.440
<font color="#00FFFF">They will be like, dark horse.</font>

40:40.480 --> 40:44.640
<font color="#11FF11">I think it shows an edgier side</font>
<font color="#11FF11">to you.</font>

40:44.680 --> 40:49.520
<font color="#11FF11">I think it is good. I like that.</font>

40:49.560 --> 40:52.560
What is the crack with the coupling?

40:52.600 --> 40:56.800
<font color="#FFFF00">I'm like, who do I feel more</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">comfortable with?</font>

40:56.840 --> 40:58.640
<font color="#FFFF00">It was the fact that I thought</font>

40:58.680 --> 41:01.880
<font color="#FFFF00">Hayley would be comfortable</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">to have a kiss.</font>

41:01.920 --> 41:04.000
<font color="#FFFF00">Turns out it was awkward.</font>

41:04.040 --> 41:06.040
<font color="#00FFFF">(LAUGHS)</font>

41:06.080 --> 41:07.800
<font color="#00FFFF">I forgot about that.</font>

41:07.840 --> 41:13.040
Laura has discovered something about
Wes she finds attractive.

41:13.080 --> 41:14.680
His wallet.

41:14.720 --> 41:22.360
<font color="#00FFFF">Wes, £1000 on a date. </font><font color="#11FF11"> He is the</font>
<font color="#11FF11">package.</font>

41:22.400 --> 41:28.400
<font color="#00FFFF">When he kissed anyone else,</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">I couldn't look.</font>

41:28.440 --> 41:32.360
<font color="#00FFFF">I was like, what is wrong with me?</font>
<font color="#11FF11">Really?</font>

41:32.400 --> 41:36.960
<font color="#11FF11">You went back to kiss him again.</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">I was joking.</font>

41:37.000 --> 41:45.560
<font color="#FFFF00">Were you kind of joking? (LAUGHS)</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">I'm scared of liking someone.</font>

41:45.600 --> 41:47.600
<font color="#11FF11">It was a good kiss to be fair.</font>

41:47.640 --> 41:55.200
<font color="#11FF11">She wanted a bit more.</font>
<font color="#11FF11">She appreciated it. It was good.</font>

41:55.240 --> 41:58.640
<font color="#00FFFF">In that challenge,</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">I just felt all flustered.</font>

41:58.680 --> 42:03.400
<font color="#00FFFF">I don't go around kissing and</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">things.</font>

42:03.440 --> 42:13.160
<font color="#00FFFF">I'm not attracted to him any more.</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">Eyal. I need to say it.</font>

42:15.160 --> 42:20.160
<font color="#00FFFF">It is very confusing. I'm putting a</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">lot of pressure on myself,</font>

42:20.200 --> 42:25.640
<font color="#00FFFF">thinking I'm boxed off for life</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">with my first couple up.</font>

42:25.680 --> 42:28.680
<font color="#00FFFF">Just very confused.</font>

42:28.720 --> 42:34.320
<font color="#FFFF00">Jack. It is a sore subject. It makes</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">me want to cry. </font><font color="#11FF11"> What is it?</font>

42:34.360 --> 42:40.280
<font color="#FFFF00">I always step forward</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">for the same boys.</font>

42:40.320 --> 42:44.880
<font color="#FFFF00">You know I mean? He's cheated on all</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">of his girlfriends. </font><font color="#00FFFF"> Two.</font>

42:44.920 --> 42:51.640
<font color="#FFFF00">It is the way he was, like,</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">it's only two.</font>

42:51.680 --> 42:56.400
<font color="#FFFF00">I'm just being silly.</font>
<font color="#11FF11">Let it all out.</font>

42:56.440 --> 43:04.640
<font color="#FFFF00">I feel like I have stepped forward</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">for a boy I always go for.</font>

43:04.680 --> 43:06.960
<font color="#FFFF00">I have really made a mistake.</font>

43:07.000 --> 43:09.000
It is only early days.

43:09.040 --> 43:12.960
<font color="#11FF11">He could really blow your mind.</font>
<font color="#11FF11">He could change it around.</font>

43:13.000 --> 43:19.640
<font color="#FFFF00">I was disappointed. When I heard</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">that about Jack. It was only two.</font>

43:19.680 --> 43:23.840
<font color="#FFFF00">I don't care if it was one!</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">You don't say it like that.</font>

43:23.880 --> 43:26.720
<font color="#FFFF00">He should have said,</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">I made a mistake.</font>

43:26.760 --> 43:31.320
<font color="#FFFF00">His reaction wasn't that great.</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">It couldn't have been only two.</font>

43:31.360 --> 43:35.920
<font color="#FFFF00">'All of my girlfriends.'</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">It was a bit muggy.</font>

43:35.960 --> 43:38.680
Do you feel that Dani will quiz you?

43:38.720 --> 43:51.040
<font color="#00FFFF">It is only two birds.</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">I was only 17 the first time.</font>

43:51.080 --> 43:56.440
<font color="#00FFFF">The next one,</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">she cheated on me first.</font>

43:56.480 --> 44:02.160
<font color="#00FFFF">I have not met the right person. I</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">wouldn't cheat on the right person.</font>

44:02.200 --> 44:08.280
<font color="#11FF11">She will understand</font>
<font color="#11FF11">if you tell her that. </font><font color="#00FFFF"> I hope so.</font>

44:13.640 --> 44:18.360
Alex has had a tough first few days
in the villa.

44:18.400 --> 44:26.360
<font color="#FFFF00">I'm sick of it all. I've had about</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">enough. I feel like I am a leper.</font>

44:26.400 --> 44:33.880
<font color="#FFFF00">What is wrong with me? </font><font color="#00FFFF"> You are</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">a  doctor! </font><font color="#FFFF00"> It is not all about that.</font>

44:33.920 --> 44:36.840
<font color="#00FFFF">It is not the fact you are a doctor.</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">That shows how smart you are.</font>

44:36.880 --> 44:40.120
<font color="#00FFFF">You are good-looking and you have</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">a great personality. You are deep.</font>

44:40.160 --> 44:50.960
<font color="#FFFF00">I hate feeling like this.  I've had</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">enough. I'm at that point.</font>

44:52.760 --> 44:55.960
You haven't clicked with someone.
That is the only thing.

44:56.000 --> 45:01.040
Someone in here hasn't been right
for you. <font color="#00FFFF">Yeah.</font>

45:01.080 --> 45:03.760
<font color="#FFFF00">I always think today is going to be</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">a good day</font>

45:03.800 --> 45:05.680
<font color="#FFFF00">and then something happens.</font>

45:05.720 --> 45:11.120
You're a catch. Confidence.
Keep it up. Don't worry about that.

45:19.840 --> 45:22.240
The boys are about to get a boost.

45:22.280 --> 45:26.240
We are sending two new girls
to the villa.

45:29.240 --> 45:35.120
<font color="#FFFF00">I am Georgia. I'm 20.</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">I'm a student at drama school.</font>

45:35.160 --> 45:38.360
<font color="#FFFF00">I don't know what flirting is and</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">what being friendly is.</font>

45:38.400 --> 45:40.200
<font color="#FFFF00">It gets me into trouble.</font>

45:40.240 --> 45:43.440
<font color="#FFFF00">I would like to meet someone who</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">could handle me.</font>

45:43.480 --> 45:45.480
<font color="#FFFF00">I need someone to tame me.</font>

45:45.520 --> 45:48.480
<font color="#FFFF00">All of the other girls will be older</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">than me.</font>

45:48.520 --> 45:52.680
<font color="#FFFF00">That doesn't intimidate me.</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">There is only one Georgia.</font>

45:52.720 --> 45:55.160
<font color="#FFFF00">Everybody says it and everybody</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">knows it.</font>

45:59.160 --> 46:03.360
<font color="#00FFFF">I am Rosie, I'm 26 and I'm</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">a solicitor from South Wales.</font>

46:03.400 --> 46:05.960
<font color="#00FFFF">I'm not your stereotypical lawyer.</font>

46:06.000 --> 46:09.080
<font color="#00FFFF">A lot of my friends call me</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">Legally Brunette.</font>

46:09.120 --> 46:12.720
<font color="#00FFFF">I don't take things too seriously.</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">I like to work hard</font>

46:12.760 --> 46:15.040
<font color="#00FFFF">and then play a lot harder.</font>

46:15.080 --> 46:17.080
<font color="#00FFFF">I'm like a bottle of champagne.</font>

46:17.120 --> 46:21.720
<font color="#00FFFF">You can shake me and then one day</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">that top is going to come off.</font>

46:21.760 --> 46:25.200
<font color="#00FFFF">I hope when I walk into the villa,</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">the boys think,</font>

46:25.480 --> 46:27.680
<font color="#00FFFF">here comes a little Welsh wonder.</font>
