WEBVTT

00:00.467 --> 00:03.235
<i>I don't think it is</i>
<i>a matter of the president</i>

00:03.237 --> 00:04.570
<i>Showing leadership.</i>

00:04.572 --> 00:07.439
<i>In him not showing</i>
<i>certain things.</i>
<i>A star is born.</i>

00:07.441 --> 00:12.011
At 15, josephine marcus walked
into a maternity ward pregnant.

00:12.013 --> 00:14.046
But when she walked out,
there was no baby

00:14.048 --> 00:15.681
And no birth certificate.

00:15.683 --> 00:17.349
(jake) pete foster tattooed
the navy flight plan

00:17.351 --> 00:19.118
For a secret mission
called operation remington.

00:19.120 --> 00:20.386
There were five of us
on the ground

00:20.388 --> 00:21.754
And one plane flying
air support.

00:21.756 --> 00:23.155
That pilot was the president.

00:23.157 --> 00:25.024
So why does this guy
go get a tattoo

00:25.026 --> 00:31.030
What the hell is this?
A reunion
that is long overdue.

00:35.602 --> 00:36.735
What?

00:38.104 --> 00:40.372
It's just astonishing,
that's all.

00:40.374 --> 00:44.076
And you haven't once accused me
of any crimes against humanity.

00:44.078 --> 00:46.378
(huffs)
I think we're making progress.

00:47.814 --> 00:50.449
No? (laughs)

00:50.451 --> 00:52.418
You know
what I've learned?
Mnh-mnh.

00:52.420 --> 00:55.554
I've learned that accusing
you of things means nothing.

00:55.556 --> 00:58.424
It leads to power games
and moves

00:58.426 --> 01:00.159
And you making my friends
kill people.

01:00.161 --> 01:03.295
So instead of speaking my mind,
instead of being the brave,

01:03.297 --> 01:05.597
Outspoken girl my mother
taught me to be,

01:05.599 --> 01:09.268
I'm chewing my food,
fulfilling my contract.

01:09.270 --> 01:10.769
And when we're done,
I'll go home

01:10.771 --> 01:13.772
And immediately try to forget
this ever happened.

01:13.774 --> 01:16.442
Until next Sunday,
when we do it all again.

01:16.444 --> 01:18.811
How fascinating, that you think
<i>that's</i> your mother's legacy,

01:18.813 --> 01:21.246
Being brave and outspoken,

01:21.248 --> 01:22.681
When everything you've become,
everything you are,

01:22.683 --> 01:25.651
I think you mean
<i>in spite</i> of you.

01:25.653 --> 01:28.087
Two sides of the same coin,
my dear. Thank you.

01:28.089 --> 01:29.721
As for...

01:29.723 --> 01:32.591
Making your friends
kill people,

01:32.593 --> 01:35.594
That's something huck
brought on himself.

01:35.596 --> 01:40.132
He leaves me alone,
I'll leave him alone.

01:40.134 --> 01:41.834
Jake, too.

01:41.836 --> 01:43.368
They're done with dinner.
He's on his way back.

01:43.370 --> 01:44.770
Crap. How far away's
the restaurant?

01:44.772 --> 01:46.738
Three minutes,
four with traffic.

01:46.740 --> 01:48.674
Great.
How convenient for him.
You need to move.

01:48.676 --> 01:51.643
Really?
You are going to be
compromised.

01:51.645 --> 01:53.612
I'm gonna be compromised? Look,
I understand the stakes here.

01:53.614 --> 01:55.114
I'm a spy, too.
You got it yet?

01:55.116 --> 01:56.748
No. Where is he?
He's in the driveway.

01:56.750 --> 01:58.350
What? So much for traffic.

01:58.352 --> 01:59.818
I have to re-arm
the alarm system.
(typing rapidly)

01:59.820 --> 02:01.386
Just--just wait.

02:01.388 --> 02:03.222
I can't. He'll see
the alarm's disabled.

02:03.224 --> 02:04.323
He'll know you're there.
Damn it!

02:04.325 --> 02:05.424
(beeping)

02:06.426 --> 02:07.726
(beeps)

02:07.728 --> 02:11.630
(door knob turning,
door opens)

02:11.632 --> 02:12.865
(door closes)

02:12.867 --> 02:14.533
(beeping)

02:14.535 --> 02:16.568
Alarm system's disabled again.
You're free to go.

02:16.570 --> 02:18.770
(whispering) come on, come on,
come on. Almost there.
(whirring)

02:18.772 --> 02:20.539
(keys jangling)

02:20.541 --> 02:21.840
(faint, indistinct noise)

02:33.586 --> 02:35.587
You got it yet?

02:35.589 --> 02:36.889
Come on, come on.

02:37.824 --> 02:39.758
(whirring stops)

02:50.870 --> 02:53.405
(keys jangling)

03:00.813 --> 03:02.514
You got it?

03:02.516 --> 03:03.849
Yeah, I got it.

03:03.851 --> 03:09.588
(projector and camera shutter
clicking)

03:09.590 --> 03:11.823
(projector and camera shutter
clicking)

03:11.825 --> 03:14.326
Is this the--
the resolute desk, yes.

03:14.328 --> 03:16.862
John-john used to peek out
from that little door there.

03:16.864 --> 03:18.864
It is something!
Mr. Bergen--

03:18.866 --> 03:21.800
Leo. You can call me leo,
mrs. Grant.
(laughs)

03:21.802 --> 03:23.202
Is this the original?
Leo--

03:23.204 --> 03:24.770
Looks like the original.
My god.

03:26.406 --> 03:27.806
Leo, I'm sure you're wondering

03:27.808 --> 03:29.942
Why we've invited you
here today.

03:29.944 --> 03:31.677
You are gonna ask me to run

03:31.679 --> 03:33.812
The president's
re-election campaign.

03:33.814 --> 03:36.615
Yes.
We want you

03:36.617 --> 03:39.585
And your strategic brilliance,
your unconventional thinking,

03:39.587 --> 03:40.986
And of course,
your penchant for throwing

03:40.988 --> 03:43.222
An elbow or two every once
in a while. (giggles)

03:43.224 --> 03:46.358
We're offering you a chance
to stand at the center

03:46.360 --> 03:47.993
Of what's going to be
the best-funded,

03:47.995 --> 03:50.329
Best-organized campaign
this country's even seen.

03:50.331 --> 03:51.997
Top talent only, leo.

03:51.999 --> 03:53.632
What do you say?

03:53.634 --> 03:55.968
Perhaps this is
a conversation best had

03:55.970 --> 03:58.270
Between you and me, cyrus.

03:58.272 --> 04:00.706
Certainly--
no, no. I am
in this to win,

04:00.708 --> 04:02.808
So don't treat me
like the first lady.

04:02.810 --> 04:04.843
Think of me as simply
a member of the team.

04:04.845 --> 04:07.546
In this conversation,
fitz is not my husband.

04:07.548 --> 04:08.814
He's our guy.

04:09.882 --> 04:11.550
Okay.

04:11.552 --> 04:13.752
Your guy has a few things
going for him.

04:13.754 --> 04:14.953
He's a decorated vet.

04:14.955 --> 04:16.521
He survived
an assassination attempt.

04:16.523 --> 04:17.856
He's great on his feet.

04:17.858 --> 04:19.925
But he's got problems,
big problems.

04:19.927 --> 04:21.827
Character problems,
credibility problems,

04:21.829 --> 04:24.396
Penis problems, as in
he can't keep it in his pants.

04:24.398 --> 04:25.731
He's also got...
Mm-hmm.

04:25.733 --> 04:27.766
A marriage problem.
I'm sorry, ma'am,

04:27.768 --> 04:31.036
But he has a "his wife is
a frigid shrew" problem.

04:31.038 --> 04:33.772
All candidates have problems.
It's why people like us exist.

04:33.774 --> 04:37.509
Yes, but I...
Won't work for a loser.

04:37.511 --> 04:40.912
Losers? (scoffs) we're talking
about a sitting president.

04:40.914 --> 04:42.547
Cy, I don't care
about his problems.

04:42.549 --> 04:44.783
I care about optics,
how he looks.

04:44.785 --> 04:46.785
The man looks unhappy.
He looks beleaguered.

04:46.787 --> 04:48.020
He looks like hasn't had
a good--

04:48.022 --> 04:50.822
Ma'am, I apologize--
screw in a long time.

04:50.824 --> 04:52.758
He looks like a loser.

04:52.760 --> 04:55.727
Your guy's heart isn't in it.

04:55.729 --> 04:57.896
He's gonna lose.

04:57.898 --> 04:58.997
Don't get me wrong.

04:58.999 --> 05:00.766
I appreciate the big show,

05:00.768 --> 05:02.901
The invitation
to the oval office.

05:02.903 --> 05:04.403
But as hallowed
as this office is,

05:04.405 --> 05:07.673
Right now it smells
like desperation.

05:07.675 --> 05:10.409
Like losing. It smells like
nixon in '74 in here.

05:10.411 --> 05:12.544
(huffs) I don't do losers.

05:12.546 --> 05:14.613
(chuckles) besides,
we all know

05:14.615 --> 05:15.914
I'm really only here
because you destroyed

05:15.916 --> 05:18.016
Your relationship
with olivia pope.

05:18.018 --> 05:19.885
Thank you for the offer,
but I'm due on the hill

05:19.887 --> 05:21.753
To meet with josie marcus
in 20 minutes, so...

05:21.755 --> 05:23.555
Best of luck.

05:27.560 --> 05:29.761
(projector and camera shutter
clicking)

05:29.763 --> 05:31.463
You don't need branding,
congresswoman.

05:31.465 --> 05:32.764
You seem to have a very
strong grasp

05:32.766 --> 05:34.466
On who you are
and what you believe in.

05:34.468 --> 05:35.967
I don't need my ass kissed,
ms. Pope.

05:35.969 --> 05:38.036
You don't need branding.
You need discipline.

05:38.038 --> 05:39.738
You need gravitas.

05:39.740 --> 05:41.106
You do not feel presidential.

05:41.108 --> 05:43.375
I do not trust you
with the nuclear codes.

05:43.377 --> 05:45.344
You're charming, but you're
easily flustered.

05:45.346 --> 05:46.845
You're fresh,
but you're inexperienced.

05:46.847 --> 05:48.613
You feel like
a high schooler

05:48.615 --> 05:52.851
I can change that. I can
help you push the undecideds

05:52.853 --> 05:55.620
In your party off the fence
and into your camp.

05:55.622 --> 05:56.788
Thank you, ms. Pope.
That's all the time we have.

05:56.790 --> 05:59.024
Oh, she's hired.

05:59.026 --> 06:01.827
Josie, we have more
candidates to consider.

06:01.829 --> 06:04.396
Leo bergen's outside waiting.
Send him home then.

06:04.398 --> 06:05.530
And can you clear the room?

06:05.532 --> 06:08.100
I need a moment alone
with ms. Pope.

06:09.102 --> 06:10.969
Sorry, candi. You, too.

06:13.840 --> 06:16.375
My little sister.
She's very protective.

06:16.377 --> 06:21.580
Now, truth is, I don't really
need much of a campaign manager.

06:21.582 --> 06:22.981
Then why did you
just hire me?

06:22.983 --> 06:26.718
Because you fix problems,
and I've got a big one.

06:26.720 --> 06:29.388
I had a baby at 15.

06:29.390 --> 06:31.423
Gave it up
and never looked back.

06:31.425 --> 06:32.958
How many people know?

06:32.960 --> 06:35.160
My mother, god rest her.
She covered her tracks.

06:35.162 --> 06:36.695
Candi doesn't even know.

06:36.697 --> 06:39.831
But I'd say there are about
five other people

06:39.833 --> 06:42.868
Back in red springs who could
talk if they wanted to.

06:42.870 --> 06:44.936
You were a teenager
who made a difficult choice

06:44.938 --> 06:46.605
In a difficult situation.

06:46.607 --> 06:48.140
We can spin this
any number of ways

06:48.142 --> 06:50.142
To galvanize your base
and solidify female support.

06:50.144 --> 06:51.576
No.

06:51.578 --> 06:52.978
That baby's
a grown woman now.

06:52.980 --> 06:54.780
She's out there somewhere
living her life,

06:54.782 --> 06:56.114
And she deserves her privacy.

06:56.116 --> 06:58.683
I'm not gonna use this
for political gain, okay?

06:58.685 --> 07:00.051
Not now, not ever.
Congresswoman--

07:00.053 --> 07:02.788
Did you hear me?
You heard my problem.

07:02.790 --> 07:04.856
Now go ahead and fix it.

07:12.198 --> 07:14.499
I'm gonna need you all
on the next flight

07:14.501 --> 07:16.435
To red springs, montana.

07:16.437 --> 07:19.938
(projector and camera shutter
clicking)

07:21.741 --> 07:24.476
The sex is great.
I think most guys would be happy

07:24.478 --> 07:25.944
With twice in one morning.

07:25.946 --> 07:28.213
(lowered voice) I wasn't trying
to sneak out, david. It's...

07:28.215 --> 07:29.781
I didn't want
to wake you up.

07:29.783 --> 07:31.550
It's just gonna take
a while.

07:31.552 --> 07:32.818
He's got everything
seriously encrypted.

07:32.820 --> 07:34.553
Who are you talking to?
It's nobody.

07:34.555 --> 07:37.856
Correspondents' dinner?
Yeah, I guess.

07:37.858 --> 07:39.825
No, I'll go.

07:39.827 --> 07:41.993
(projector and camera shutter
clicking)
(hawk cries)

07:45.932 --> 07:49.234
Why are we stopping?
Sadly, we're here.

07:49.236 --> 07:51.937
(projector and camera shutter
clicking)

07:53.807 --> 07:57.742
(sighs) this is the suite.
Let's just find
these people,

07:57.744 --> 07:59.177
Shut it down,
and get out of dodge.

07:59.179 --> 08:01.046
Aside from josie's mother
who died years ago,

08:01.048 --> 08:03.181
There were five other people
who knew she was pregnant--

08:03.183 --> 08:04.883
The doctor who delivered
the baby,

08:04.885 --> 08:06.685
The nurse who assisted him,
her high school best friend,

08:06.687 --> 08:08.186
Her cousin.
Don't forget
the baby daddy.

08:08.188 --> 08:09.788
Billy joe lee. Seriously?
Billy joe lee?

08:09.790 --> 08:11.857
Three first names?

08:11.859 --> 08:13.725
Okay, abby, let's just
start with the doctor.

08:13.727 --> 08:15.227
Wait, what about me?
Baby huck it.

08:15.229 --> 08:16.695
Help him track down the nurse.

08:16.697 --> 08:19.097
(computer beeps, door opens)

08:20.266 --> 08:22.968
(door closes)
huck?

08:22.970 --> 08:24.236
(door closes)

08:27.507 --> 08:29.941
(beeping)

08:33.145 --> 08:35.814
(taps key)
<i>almost didn't know</i>
<i>where to look for you.</i>

08:35.816 --> 08:37.782
<i>Someone I haven't seen</i>
<i>in 20 years,</i>

08:37.784 --> 08:39.618
<i>And then it struck me--</i>

08:39.620 --> 08:42.087
<i>You're exactly</i>
<i>where I left you.</i>

08:42.089 --> 08:45.090
<i>Standing in the shadows.</i>
<i>Pulling my strings.</i>

08:45.092 --> 08:46.558
You act
like this is personal.

08:46.560 --> 08:48.793
Oh, it's personal to me.

08:48.795 --> 08:50.962
What you did to pete foster--
pete foster committed suic--

08:50.964 --> 08:53.198
Don't lie to me.

08:53.200 --> 08:54.933
You've wanted him dead
from the beginning,

08:54.935 --> 08:56.701
And you finally
got your way.

08:56.703 --> 08:58.203
So who's next?

08:58.205 --> 09:00.038
Who else has to die
to protect a secret

09:00.040 --> 09:01.907
That no one on this planet
is looking for?

09:02.975 --> 09:04.809
As we speak,
our computer specialists

09:04.811 --> 09:07.279
Are tracing the I.P. Address
that accessed...

09:07.281 --> 09:08.847
(opens drawer)

09:08.849 --> 09:12.083
These files on pete foster
from the navy's server.

09:12.085 --> 09:15.186
Someone is looking.

09:15.188 --> 09:16.288
(taps key)

09:18.658 --> 09:20.792
(cell phone rings)

09:20.794 --> 09:22.127
You got something?

09:22.129 --> 09:23.795
Surveillance footage
of a meeting

09:23.797 --> 09:26.932
Sounds like they were
talking about remington.

09:26.934 --> 09:28.333
So the president's in on it?

09:28.335 --> 09:32.103
When he didn't?
Maybe because he was
doing something else,

09:32.105 --> 09:33.872
Something they wanted
to cover up.

09:33.874 --> 09:35.607
Also, command knows
someone's digging.

09:35.609 --> 09:36.942
He doesn't know who.
Yeah, I think he does.

09:36.944 --> 09:39.344
Jake ballard?
Get in the car.

09:40.780 --> 09:42.347
(projector and camera shutter
clicking)

09:47.920 --> 09:50.655
You know, I have a phone.
It works.

09:50.657 --> 09:51.890
I even answer it sometimes.

09:51.892 --> 09:53.692
Maybe I wanted
to get in your head.

09:56.729 --> 09:58.797
I got to play in a game
with lebron james.

09:58.799 --> 10:00.899
Perk of the gig,
but like everyone else,

10:00.901 --> 10:03.234
He took it easy on me.

10:03.236 --> 10:04.369
That was never a problem
with you.

10:04.371 --> 10:06.104
It's been a while.

10:11.877 --> 10:13.745
Oh, I'm sure it has.

10:13.747 --> 10:17.248
("pick up the pieces" by
average white band playing)

10:18.618 --> 10:20.051
(projector and camera shutter
clicking)

10:22.355 --> 10:24.289
(projector and camera shutter
clicking)

10:24.291 --> 10:25.757
Here we go. Ready?

10:25.759 --> 10:29.761
¶

10:29.763 --> 10:30.962
(projector and camera shutter
clicking)

10:30.964 --> 10:32.764
(both grunting)

10:34.133 --> 10:36.301
Ah, come on.
Should've fouled me.

10:36.303 --> 10:37.402
I don't play dirty.

10:37.404 --> 10:40.105
Oh, you changed your game?
(laughs)

10:40.107 --> 10:42.107
¶

10:42.109 --> 10:43.408
(projector and camera shutter
clicking)

10:45.277 --> 10:48.413
That's game.
Uh, no. Nice try.
It's win by 2.

10:48.415 --> 10:51.249
¶

10:51.251 --> 10:53.118
(both grunting)

11:00.793 --> 11:04.062
(grunts)
(grunts loudly)

11:04.064 --> 11:06.331
(panting)

11:06.333 --> 11:07.699
Come on.

11:07.701 --> 11:09.367
Thought you didn't play dirty.
(grunts)

11:09.369 --> 11:11.436
Well, when in rome,
right?

11:11.438 --> 11:14.205
What the hell does that mean?
You tell me, sir.

11:14.207 --> 11:16.675
(lowered voice) you were
supposed to watch her, remember?

11:16.677 --> 11:18.043
That's it.

11:18.045 --> 11:19.310
You lied to me.

11:19.312 --> 11:20.712
(scoffs)

11:20.714 --> 11:23.048
I'm not talking about olivia.

11:23.050 --> 11:27.218
(dribbling)

11:27.220 --> 11:30.355
(projector and camera shutter
clicking)

11:35.695 --> 11:40.198
(cell phone vibrating)

11:41.400 --> 11:42.734
(clicks and beeps)

11:42.736 --> 11:44.135
Hello?

11:44.137 --> 11:45.704
(cyrus) how would you
like a job?

11:45.706 --> 11:48.039
Been there, done that.
No, thanks.

11:48.041 --> 11:51.076
Not that.
A smaller job.

11:51.078 --> 11:52.877
We're looking for dirt
on josie marcus.

11:52.879 --> 11:56.281
I've got a kid running the show
out in montana, but... (scoffs)

11:56.283 --> 11:57.449
He's in over his head.

11:57.451 --> 11:59.384
Josie marcus
the congresswoman?

11:59.386 --> 12:00.985
Right now she's great
for us.

12:00.987 --> 12:02.387
She's killing
in the democratic debates,

12:02.389 --> 12:03.888
Landing some punches
on reston

12:03.890 --> 12:05.156
Before he wins the nomination.

12:05.158 --> 12:06.825
But if she were to win
this thing--

12:06.827 --> 12:08.293
It'd be fitz
against a woman.

12:08.295 --> 12:09.894
You want the job?

12:09.896 --> 12:11.496
(chuckles) I think
it's a bad idea for me

12:11.498 --> 12:13.231
To work for the white house
right now.

12:13.233 --> 12:15.033
Can't blame me for trying.

12:15.035 --> 12:16.501
(beeps)

12:20.306 --> 12:21.873
Harrison?

12:21.875 --> 12:23.408
You've got company
in montana.

12:23.410 --> 12:25.877
White house has got a team
down here.

12:25.879 --> 12:28.480
Oh, and doctor was a dead end.
He died two weeks ago.

12:28.482 --> 12:30.448
Well, here's the addresses
for these three.

12:30.450 --> 12:32.383
The last one, the nurse,
she retired 16 years ago,

12:32.385 --> 12:35.286
Well, you know, I could
run her through the--
I'll find her.

12:35.288 --> 12:38.022
Have you seen the way
he's been treating me lately?

12:38.024 --> 12:39.424
He's completely
freezing me out.

12:39.426 --> 12:41.226
Yeah, well, you went all
"drill, baby, drill" on him.

12:41.228 --> 12:44.229
Yeah, he told us.
You're grounded. Let's go.

12:44.231 --> 12:46.331
("machine gun" by
the commodores playing)

12:46.333 --> 12:47.799
Can I help you folks?

12:47.801 --> 12:49.434
You were best friends
with a josephine marcus

12:49.436 --> 12:54.005
Hell, yeah, I'm josie's
cousin. Who's askin'?

12:54.007 --> 12:55.974
Me and josie--
high school sweethearts.

12:55.976 --> 12:58.042
You got that right.
You had a baby with josie.

12:58.044 --> 12:59.511
We're here to see
that never gets out.

12:59.513 --> 13:01.446
Now hold on a minute.

13:01.448 --> 13:03.348
I'm afraid I don't know
what you're talking about.

13:03.350 --> 13:05.150
That right there
is a whole can of worms

13:05.152 --> 13:07.018
That don't really need
to be reopened.

13:07.020 --> 13:09.254
Our point exactly,
billy joe.

13:09.256 --> 13:11.389
Oh, I'm so relieved to hear
we're all on the same page.

13:11.391 --> 13:13.391
(projector and camera shutter
clicking)

13:13.393 --> 13:16.361
There's 10 grand in this case--
all yours, no questions asked.

13:16.363 --> 13:18.429
We just need you to keep a tight
lid on that can of worms.

13:18.431 --> 13:20.265
We want you to keep on being
josie's friend

13:20.267 --> 13:22.534
Just like you said--
by keeping the past in the past.

13:22.536 --> 13:24.469
Take the money, lee ann. Start
a college fund for your kids.

13:24.471 --> 13:26.971
I'm beginning to see
your point there. (chuckles)

13:26.973 --> 13:29.174
Yeah, you could buy
your own thoroughbred.

13:29.176 --> 13:31.109
Nah, no way.

13:31.111 --> 13:33.278
I couldn't live with myself.

13:33.280 --> 13:34.846
¶

13:34.848 --> 13:37.148
What do you do for a living,
billy joe?

13:37.150 --> 13:38.483
Cement plant foreman.

13:38.485 --> 13:40.118
All this cash, you could
cut your hours in half,

13:40.120 --> 13:42.420
Work four days a week.
Ah, I'm not good
with idle time.

13:42.422 --> 13:43.822
Cement plant?
You wear a suit to work?

13:43.824 --> 13:45.023
It must get awful dusty.

13:45.025 --> 13:46.491
Speaking of work,
I'd best be going.

13:49.461 --> 13:51.963
Cyrus' bitch-boy.
Go stall him.

13:51.965 --> 13:53.364
I've got something, sir,

13:53.366 --> 13:55.233
Something that's gonna
cream this cream puff.

13:55.235 --> 13:57.569
Just tell me what you got.
An interview
with the baby daddy.

13:57.571 --> 13:59.304
About to go live
in a few minutes.

13:59.306 --> 14:01.539
There's hope for you yet, ethan.

14:03.542 --> 14:05.276
You lost, loser?

14:05.278 --> 14:06.578
(lowered voice) huck, I need
dirt on billy joe lee,

14:06.580 --> 14:08.079
And I need it fast.

14:08.081 --> 14:09.514
Miss whelan,

14:09.516 --> 14:12.383
Say hello to jamie roberts
of kmtu.

14:12.385 --> 14:15.053
Jamie, nice to meet you.
You know,

14:15.055 --> 14:17.121
I could give you
an exclusive.

14:17.123 --> 14:19.023
"white house attempts to meddle
in democratic primary."

14:19.025 --> 14:20.391
It'll go national,
guaranteed.

14:20.393 --> 14:24.462
No. No.
That's not what this is.

14:24.464 --> 14:26.965
Hotel... He has a standing
hotel date

14:26.967 --> 14:28.533
At the broken spoke inn
going back

14:28.535 --> 14:29.934
Over two years.

14:29.936 --> 14:34.038
Billy joe...
(laughs)

14:34.040 --> 14:35.440
Your wife know about
the broken spoke?

14:35.442 --> 14:37.075
Wha... Wha...

14:37.077 --> 14:38.443
Hmm?
Hey--

14:38.445 --> 14:40.078
<i>Was she a good kisser?</i>

14:40.080 --> 14:41.512
<i>Do you really want</i>
<i>to ask me that?</i>

14:41.514 --> 14:46.184
<i>But I will tell you</i>
<i>what a fine job she's done...</i>
<i>(cell phone rings)</i>

14:46.186 --> 14:48.987
<i>Representing this district</i>
<i>up over in congress there.</i>

14:48.989 --> 14:50.388
<i>She really...</i>
<i>(ethan) sir?</i>

14:50.390 --> 14:51.890
(exhales sharply)

14:51.892 --> 14:53.424
Sir, please say something.

14:53.426 --> 14:55.894
(billy joe speaking
indistinctly)
(exhales)

14:55.896 --> 14:57.528
I can hear you breathing, sir.

14:57.530 --> 14:59.197
Yes, I am breathing, ethan.
(gasps)

14:59.199 --> 15:01.599
I am breathing very deeply,
because I am trying my very best

15:01.601 --> 15:04.535
Not to have another
heart attack.
I'm so sorry.

15:04.537 --> 15:06.938
She has people here.
Who?

15:10.342 --> 15:13.011
We got poped, sir.

15:13.013 --> 15:14.646
(projector and camera shutter
clicking)

15:14.648 --> 15:16.648
Leo bergen turned down the job.

15:16.650 --> 15:18.416
Of course he did, because
they cut me out.

15:18.418 --> 15:20.084
I told you I needed
to be there, mara.

15:20.086 --> 15:21.152
Who's leo bergen?

15:21.154 --> 15:24.455
If cyrus beene thinks he can
cut me out of this campaign

15:24.457 --> 15:27.191
The way he did the last one...
Easy does it, sal.

15:27.193 --> 15:29.427
Daniel douglas, don't you have
somewhere to be?

15:29.429 --> 15:32.330
I gotta go cart
the german chancellor's hubby

15:32.332 --> 15:35.500
Last time, the fool lost
two dozen balls,

15:35.502 --> 15:37.235
And I got sunburned
looking for them.

15:37.237 --> 15:40.505
I assume bergen's attending
the correspondents' dinner?
Why?

15:40.507 --> 15:42.407
Never you mind.

15:42.409 --> 15:44.375
(indistinct conversations)

15:44.377 --> 15:46.544
We lost leo bergen.
You should give him a call.

15:46.546 --> 15:48.413
I have bigger problems
to deal with.

15:48.415 --> 15:50.615
Fitz!
And so do you, mellie.

15:50.617 --> 15:53.451
It's cyrus' job to worry
about my re-election, not yours.

15:53.453 --> 15:54.719
Leave it alone.

15:56.522 --> 15:57.722
(fitz) jake ballard.

15:57.724 --> 15:59.457
He's the one digging
into remington, right?

15:59.459 --> 16:01.559
As always, the less I share,
the better for us both.

16:01.561 --> 16:03.361
You need to lay off
captain ballard.

16:03.363 --> 16:04.495
Are we clear?

16:04.497 --> 16:06.397
(laughs) you do not
give me orders.

16:06.399 --> 16:09.534
That changes, starting
right here, right now.

16:09.536 --> 16:12.270
I have never answered to any
holder of your office.

16:12.272 --> 16:14.372
Don't test me.
No, mr. President,

16:14.374 --> 16:16.641
It is <i>you</i> who should not
test <i>me.</i>

16:25.751 --> 16:28.219
I gave her a world-class
education in the dark arts!

16:28.221 --> 16:30.755
I turned her into a frigging
trident ii,

16:30.757 --> 16:34.292
And now she's out there locked
and loaded in enemy hands.

16:34.294 --> 16:38.229
So... (exhales) let's think.
First things first.

16:38.231 --> 16:40.431
We leak the baby to reston
before the debate.

16:40.433 --> 16:42.233
Granted, there's no proof,

16:42.235 --> 16:44.702
But you and I both know
all too well

16:44.704 --> 16:46.671
Rumors can do
just as much damage.

16:46.673 --> 16:51.009
So we let it slip, and reston
takes care of the dirty work.

16:51.011 --> 16:53.211
(sighs) doesn't help us
with the long-term problem

16:53.213 --> 16:56.447
Of finding a campaign manager
with half a brain, <i>but...</i>

16:56.449 --> 16:59.250
First things first.
First things first.

16:59.252 --> 17:01.219
(breathing heavily)
I got made.

17:01.221 --> 17:03.221
By command?
By the president.

17:03.223 --> 17:08.559
'cause he sure as hell wasn't
flying cover on that mission.
(clicks phone)

17:08.561 --> 17:11.229
He's hiding something.
Something big.

17:11.231 --> 17:13.064
And he was there
the next day?

17:13.066 --> 17:14.265
Yeah.
I met him on the carrier

17:14.267 --> 17:15.767
In the persian gulf
during debriefing.

17:15.769 --> 17:17.668
Ten hours after remington.

17:17.670 --> 17:19.704
Okay, that narrows it down,
but pinpointing grant's

17:19.706 --> 17:21.372
Exact location on that day
in 1991

17:21.374 --> 17:23.307
Means hacking
into naval archives,

17:23.309 --> 17:25.309
Going through base logs,
fleet movements,

17:25.311 --> 17:26.711
Cross-referencing
ocean currents.

17:26.713 --> 17:28.246
I can't send an e-mail
without crashing

17:28.248 --> 17:29.614
This motel's d.S.L.

17:29.616 --> 17:32.283
Look... (gasps) if fitz
knows we're on to him,

17:32.285 --> 17:33.818
Then rowan knows.

17:33.820 --> 17:36.387
He's gonna send agents after us.
We're running out of time.

17:36.389 --> 17:38.356
I have a program
that could help,

17:38.358 --> 17:40.191
But it's on my office
computer.

17:40.193 --> 17:42.193
(whirring)
what exactly is this program
supposed to do?

17:42.195 --> 17:44.228
Because it's not doing it.
Well, if you did
what I told you,

17:44.230 --> 17:46.464
It should be accessing the navy
missions flown by the president.

17:46.466 --> 17:51.069
Were you even in b613? Maybe we
should search by plane type.

17:51.071 --> 17:52.437
It is searching by plane type
and date.

17:52.439 --> 17:53.604
Oh, hold on.

17:53.606 --> 17:56.307
(beeping)
a list just came up.

17:56.309 --> 17:59.844
Okay. Um...
How do you print?

18:01.213 --> 18:02.580
(door closes)

18:05.350 --> 18:07.718
What are you doing here?
Well, I went by your place
and you weren't there.

18:07.720 --> 18:09.487
It's late, and I know all
your people are out of town.

18:09.489 --> 18:11.823
So... (chuckles)
I was worried.

18:11.825 --> 18:13.424
Oh.

18:13.426 --> 18:15.293
I'm fine. I just,

18:15.295 --> 18:17.795
Uh... I forgot my phone.

18:17.797 --> 18:19.630
Phone's in your hand.

18:21.867 --> 18:23.267
Mm.

18:23.269 --> 18:25.169
You forgot your secret
fitz phone.

18:25.171 --> 18:27.271
(sighs)
olivia.

18:27.273 --> 18:30.741
The white house correspondents'
dinner is Saturday.
(sets down phone)

18:30.743 --> 18:32.810
I haven't missed a dinner
in...

18:32.812 --> 18:35.379
(sighs) you know
I vet his jokes?

18:35.381 --> 18:37.248
Used to. Every year.

18:37.250 --> 18:40.184
There's an art to it.
You can't be too funny.

18:40.186 --> 18:43.888
You have to sort walk this line
between presidential and...

18:43.890 --> 18:48.292
This year, I got
my invitation, and I'm just...

18:53.599 --> 18:55.800
You're waiting
for the phone to ring

18:55.802 --> 18:59.370
Because maybe he needs you
to...

18:59.372 --> 19:00.404
Vet his jokes.

19:02.341 --> 19:03.508
Oh...

19:03.510 --> 19:04.809
Hmm.

19:04.811 --> 19:06.577
(laughs)

19:09.882 --> 19:12.450
(clears throat)

19:22.694 --> 19:25.296
(laughs)
(chuckles)

19:25.298 --> 19:28.332
Come on. I'll buy you
a burger.

19:28.334 --> 19:29.400
(hands slap)

19:29.402 --> 19:31.235
(chuckles)

19:31.237 --> 19:33.571
Come on.

19:33.573 --> 19:35.373
(projector and camera shutter
clicking)

19:39.645 --> 19:40.878
(chuckles)

19:40.880 --> 19:42.547
This our nurse?

19:42.549 --> 19:43.848
(projector and camera shutter
clicking)

19:43.850 --> 19:45.550
(quinn) yeah.

19:45.552 --> 19:47.752
Hey, I found her.
Grounded.

19:49.955 --> 19:53.224
I don't know why you people
won't let that family be.

19:53.226 --> 19:55.293
That other boy already tried
to talk to me.

19:55.295 --> 19:57.228
That other...
The one
with the dark hair

19:57.230 --> 19:58.563
And the slick suit.
(laughs)

19:58.565 --> 20:00.331
Looked like some kind
of a mannequin.

20:00.333 --> 20:01.799
I told him to get lost.

20:01.801 --> 20:03.601
Oh, no, we aren't--

20:03.603 --> 20:06.304
Y'all are all talking about
an abandoned baby.

20:06.306 --> 20:07.805
That baby wasn't abandoned.

20:07.807 --> 20:10.641
No?
Of course not. That family
took care of it,

20:10.643 --> 20:13.411
Like families do around here.
(huffs)

20:13.413 --> 20:15.246
That baby didn't go nowhere.

20:15.248 --> 20:17.315
It stayed right here
in red springs.

20:17.317 --> 20:19.217
Louise wouldn't have it
any other way.

20:19.219 --> 20:20.451
Louise?

20:20.453 --> 20:22.453
Josephine's mama.

20:25.357 --> 20:27.692
(speaking indistinctly)

20:27.694 --> 20:30.394
Can I speak to you alone?
Could we have a minute,
everyone?

20:37.302 --> 20:38.469
(door closes)

20:38.471 --> 20:40.238
You didn't put the baby
up for adoption.

20:40.240 --> 20:42.573
Your mother decided
to take care of the problem

20:42.575 --> 20:44.308
The best way she knew how--
keep it in the family,

20:44.310 --> 20:46.911
Raise candace as your sister
instead of your daughter.

20:49.381 --> 20:50.715
Hmm.

20:50.717 --> 20:53.317
When I got pregnant,
we moved away for a while

20:53.319 --> 20:54.952
So no one would ask questions.

20:54.954 --> 20:56.988
And then when the baby came,
the nurse changed

20:56.990 --> 20:59.557
The birth certificate,
and candi became my sister.

20:59.559 --> 21:01.392
Bing, bang, boom.
Just like that.

21:01.394 --> 21:02.460
She doesn't know.

21:02.462 --> 21:03.828
It would devastate her.

21:03.830 --> 21:06.464
My mother was her mother
in every way that matters.

21:06.466 --> 21:09.333
It only took my team
a day to dig this up,

21:09.335 --> 21:10.568
And the people
you're up against--

21:10.570 --> 21:12.303
Reston, the white house--

21:12.305 --> 21:13.904
The only way for you
to stop them

21:13.906 --> 21:16.440
From destroying you with this
is to address it head on.

21:16.442 --> 21:17.875
And then what?

21:17.877 --> 21:19.277
I'm supposed
to just sit back

21:19.279 --> 21:22.480
How bad do you want
to be president?

21:22.482 --> 21:25.683
I never planned
for life in the public eye.

21:25.685 --> 21:28.486
I had a career in the military,
and I was fine with that.

21:28.488 --> 21:30.488
And then my husband died
in that stupid war,

21:30.490 --> 21:32.356
And I happened to voice
my outrage.

21:32.358 --> 21:34.492
I didn't expect people
to listen to me.

21:34.494 --> 21:36.460
And I certainly didn't expect
people to vote for me.

21:36.462 --> 21:39.330
But they did.
And now you're here.

21:39.332 --> 21:41.899
And tonight, you're standing
in front of the nation

21:41.901 --> 21:43.901
And saying you want to be
the first female president.

21:43.903 --> 21:46.937
Without making your
personal life fair game.

21:46.939 --> 21:48.706
Coming after me is fair.

21:48.708 --> 21:51.008
Coming after me?
Yeah, I signed up for that.

21:51.010 --> 21:54.578
But candi, my sister--
off limits.

21:54.580 --> 21:57.081
How bad do I want it?

21:57.083 --> 21:58.449
Not that bad.

22:03.955 --> 22:05.656
(knock on door)

22:05.658 --> 22:07.391
You asked for me, sir?

22:07.393 --> 22:10.528
Sit.
Sir, if this is about
the josie marcus thing--

22:10.530 --> 22:12.697
How do I get rid of b613?
I want them gone.

22:12.699 --> 22:14.065
(whispering) don't...

22:16.702 --> 22:20.404
Sir--
okay... (sighs)

22:28.714 --> 22:30.114
(breathes unevenly)

22:30.116 --> 22:31.749
(lowered voice)
don't ever...

22:31.751 --> 22:33.818
Say that again.

22:33.820 --> 22:36.887
That is impossible,
mr. President.

22:36.889 --> 22:39.890
(lowered voice)
nothing is impossible.

22:39.892 --> 22:41.792
What if we eliminated
their budget?

22:41.794 --> 22:45.129
A few years ago,
this guy at the o.M.B.

22:45.131 --> 22:48.099
Comes across a very,
very strange

22:48.101 --> 22:49.867
Line item
in the federal budget.

22:49.869 --> 22:51.102
It's been there for years,

22:51.104 --> 22:53.571
But no one's ever
mentioned it

22:53.573 --> 22:56.073
Until this one person,
this one man

22:56.075 --> 22:57.775
Points it out.
And what happened?

22:57.777 --> 22:59.410
He committed suicide.

22:59.412 --> 23:00.811
That's how
they took care of it,

23:00.813 --> 23:02.012
And that's how they'll
take care of us

23:02.014 --> 23:03.948
If they start to see us
as enemies.

23:03.950 --> 23:06.150
Only in your case,
it won't be suicide.
(sighs)

23:06.152 --> 23:08.419
It'll be a lone gunman
on a grassy knoll.

23:08.421 --> 23:11.956
Just ask kennedy.

23:11.958 --> 23:13.758
This is something
you can't control,

23:13.760 --> 23:16.727
Mr. President.

23:16.729 --> 23:18.996
What you can control
is winning re-election.

23:18.998 --> 23:20.865
That's what I'm focused on,
and if you're smart,

23:20.867 --> 23:22.466
You'll focus on that, too.

23:25.937 --> 23:27.872
(projector and camera shutter
clicking)

23:27.874 --> 23:30.040
(david) couple more
days, huh?
Unfortunately.

23:30.042 --> 23:31.976
So sorry to miss
the correspondents' dinner.

23:31.978 --> 23:34.044
Now I'm gonna have to talk
to people from work all night.

23:34.046 --> 23:35.946
You ever try to party
with bureaucrats?

23:35.948 --> 23:37.448
Help... Me.

23:37.450 --> 23:39.450
I'll call you
when I get back.

23:39.452 --> 23:40.851
(beeps)

23:40.853 --> 23:42.853
(sighs) you got issues.

23:42.855 --> 23:45.556
What?
You... Got... Issues,
I'm just sayin'.

23:45.558 --> 23:47.124
Whatever. Let's just
get out of here.

23:47.126 --> 23:48.626
Where's quinn?

23:48.628 --> 23:49.994
Hardware store,
returning some stuff.

23:49.996 --> 23:51.929
(sighs)

23:51.931 --> 23:53.431
These are used.

23:53.433 --> 23:54.899
Actually, they're improved.

23:54.901 --> 23:57.501
That router's now pulling
300 megabits per second,

23:57.503 --> 24:00.104
And the shielding
on the cables--
I can offer you store credit.

24:00.106 --> 24:02.973
What a thrilling compromise.

24:03.975 --> 24:05.810
(sighs)

24:11.450 --> 24:14.084
(projector and camera shutter
clicking)

24:16.989 --> 24:20.758
<i>With governor reston</i>
<i>still leading in the polls,</i>

24:20.760 --> 24:22.660

24:32.538 --> 24:34.605
(indistinct conversations)

24:40.011 --> 24:41.712
(lowered voice)
it's going to happen.

24:41.714 --> 24:43.848
Tonight. You're going
to get ambushed.

24:43.850 --> 24:45.883
I know how they operate.
I know cyrus beene.

24:45.885 --> 24:47.718
(lowered voice) I'm not running
against the white house.

24:47.720 --> 24:49.153
No, but they're running
against you.

24:49.155 --> 24:50.788
When the trap is sprung,

24:50.790 --> 24:51.922
Acknowledge it
without hesitation.

24:51.924 --> 24:54.024
Note that you were exercising
choice,

24:54.026 --> 24:56.093
And restate your support
for access to contraception.

24:56.095 --> 24:58.596
Then insist that the privacy
of the child you gave up

24:58.598 --> 25:01.866
Like I said before,
I'm not admitting to anything.

25:01.868 --> 25:03.734
(woman over speakers)
please welcome to the stage

25:03.736 --> 25:06.136
The candidates
for the democratic nomination

25:06.138 --> 25:08.506
For president
of the United States.

25:08.508 --> 25:12.576
(applause)

25:12.578 --> 25:14.879
(speaking inaudibly)

25:14.881 --> 25:16.680
Governor, the recent revelation

25:16.682 --> 25:18.883
Of president grant's
marital infidelity

25:18.885 --> 25:21.852
Is considered by many to be
a moral failing.

25:21.854 --> 25:24.021
Do you think it should
disqualify him

25:24.023 --> 25:28.626
<i>(debate continues tv)</i>
<i>that question is nothing</i>
<i>but unadulterated liberal bias.</i>

25:28.628 --> 25:30.094
Really, who the hell
is running this thing?

25:30.096 --> 25:32.897
Don't sweat it.
We're getting to the good stuff.

25:32.899 --> 25:34.865
...Moral authority he once
may have claimed

25:34.867 --> 25:36.700
Has been wholly compromised.
The voters...

25:36.702 --> 25:37.902
(lowered voice) she looks good,
right? Strong.

25:37.904 --> 25:40.571
...Integrity, candor--
these are qualities

25:40.573 --> 25:42.740
That we look for
in a president.

25:42.742 --> 25:45.809
As everyone knows, I have
publicly and forthrightly

25:45.811 --> 25:49.280
Taken personal responsibility
for my past actions.

25:49.282 --> 25:52.016
Regrettably, I'm afraid
the same can't be said

25:52.018 --> 25:54.952
For one of my opponents
here this evening.

25:55.954 --> 25:57.821
Say good-bye, annie oakley.

25:57.823 --> 26:00.824
<i>Congresswoman marcus,</i>
<i>anything you'd care to share</i>

26:00.826 --> 26:03.193
<i>With the american people</i>
<i>at this time?</i>

26:03.195 --> 26:04.295
<i>I...</i>

26:04.297 --> 26:06.163

I...

What's the matter with her?

Congresswoman marcus?

26:09.969 --> 26:12.937
(murmuring continues)

26:17.208 --> 26:19.877
(clicks tongue)
I th...

26:19.879 --> 26:24.248
I think what... Governor reston
is trying to say

26:24.250 --> 26:27.718
Is I had a baby.

26:27.720 --> 26:29.653
30 years ago, I was 15,

26:29.655 --> 26:31.989
And I had a baby.

26:33.091 --> 26:35.025
I made a mistake.

26:35.027 --> 26:36.660
I was young and stupid,

26:36.662 --> 26:39.029
And, uh, he was a boy
with a nice smile

26:39.031 --> 26:40.931
And a shiny yellow pickup truck,

26:40.933 --> 26:42.700
And I thought I was in love.

26:42.702 --> 26:45.002
I don't know if any of you
remember what you were like

26:45.004 --> 26:48.606
When you were 15, but I was
not ready to be a mother.

26:48.608 --> 26:51.008
I knew that,
and my mother knew that,

26:51.010 --> 26:55.946
And she did what she thought
was right.

26:55.948 --> 26:58.082
She really--she really did
the best she could,

26:58.084 --> 27:01.385
So she helped me
keep the baby a secret.

27:01.387 --> 27:04.922
And when the time came,
she helped me...

27:04.924 --> 27:06.991
Say good-bye

27:06.993 --> 27:09.893
And put her up for adoption.

27:12.130 --> 27:14.732
<i>So it wasn't</i>
<i>the perfect choice,</i>

27:14.734 --> 27:16.734
<i>But it was my choice.</i>

27:16.736 --> 27:20.137
<i>It was a choice we made</i>
<i>so that baby could</i>

27:20.139 --> 27:22.973
<i>Have a better life</i>
<i>than the one I could give her.</i>

27:22.975 --> 27:24.875
I mean, I could tell you this--

27:24.877 --> 27:28.045
That a day hasn't gone by
in the past 30 years

27:28.047 --> 27:30.047
That I haven't thought
about that baby girl

27:30.049 --> 27:32.883
And the choice I made for her

27:32.885 --> 27:36.420
And hoped to god
it was the right choice.

27:36.422 --> 27:37.888
So that's it.
There you have it.

27:37.890 --> 27:40.891
That's the truth, folks.

27:40.893 --> 27:42.292
Aren't you gonna buzz me
or something?

27:42.294 --> 27:44.061
I must be out of time.

28:04.884 --> 28:07.217
Candace--
(sighs)

28:09.921 --> 28:11.989
You handled that beautifully.

28:11.991 --> 28:13.424
I just destroyed

28:13.426 --> 28:15.759
The most important
relationship in my life.

28:15.761 --> 28:17.261
I'm glad you found that
beautiful.

Hi.

29:15.755 --> 29:17.521
That was well-done.

29:17.523 --> 29:20.057
The debate, josie.
Smart.

29:20.059 --> 29:22.459
I got fired.

29:22.461 --> 29:24.461
She fired me.

29:24.463 --> 29:25.963
She's an idiot.

29:29.100 --> 29:31.001
You're calling me.

29:31.003 --> 29:32.903
I'm calling you.

29:32.905 --> 29:35.472
I'm hiding from mellie
in the bathroom.

29:35.474 --> 29:37.141
(chuckles)

29:37.143 --> 29:41.512
I just dug the phone
out of the trash. (laughs)

29:41.514 --> 29:45.415
(chuckles)
oh, how are you?
Are you freaking out

29:45.417 --> 29:47.851
About the white house
correspondents' dinner?

29:47.853 --> 29:50.053
I am freaking <i>out</i>

29:50.055 --> 29:52.122
About the white house
correspondents' dinner.

29:52.124 --> 29:54.391
Who's vetting your jokes?
Me.

29:54.393 --> 29:56.226
You can't vet your jokes.
You're not funny.

29:56.228 --> 29:58.095
I know that.
Wait, I'm funny.

29:58.097 --> 30:00.364
You're funny, but you're
not    <i>funny.</i>

30:00.366 --> 30:02.533
And you're funny?
I'm funnier than you.

30:02.535 --> 30:04.802
(chuckles)

30:11.943 --> 30:13.944
I...

30:15.313 --> 30:16.914
I feel a... (sighs)

30:19.150 --> 30:20.484
Ashamed.

30:20.486 --> 30:22.152
Like I don't have the right
to make jokes,

30:22.154 --> 30:23.487
Because I am the joke,

30:23.489 --> 30:24.988
The guy who can't keep it
in his pants,

30:24.990 --> 30:26.390
Like my father, you know?

30:26.392 --> 30:29.193
(sighs)

30:29.195 --> 30:31.595
Dive in. Own it.

30:31.597 --> 30:33.330
Mock your image.

30:33.332 --> 30:35.299
You start out strong,
something like,

30:35.301 --> 30:37.301
"I see a lot of familiar
faces here tonight,

30:37.303 --> 30:38.569
"including one or two
who inexplicably

30:38.571 --> 30:40.470
Haven't been accused
of sleeping with me."

30:40.472 --> 30:43.440
(chuckles) that's good.

30:43.442 --> 30:45.475
(clattering)
laugh at yourself.

30:45.477 --> 30:47.945
It will make it impossible
for them to laugh at you.

30:50.982 --> 30:52.482
I love you.

30:58.523 --> 31:00.324
Okay.

31:00.326 --> 31:01.558
What about...

31:01.560 --> 31:03.327
I say something
to the press

31:03.329 --> 31:04.628
About how much
they've hammered me?
(clicks pen)

31:04.630 --> 31:05.963
Something like...

31:05.965 --> 31:09.333
"you're welcome."
(chuckles) exactly.

31:09.335 --> 31:12.603
All right, uh, so we have
to say something about sally.

31:12.605 --> 31:14.471
Let me see. They wrote me
a bunch of jokes.

31:14.473 --> 31:16.874
You tell me which ones
you like best.

31:19.244 --> 31:21.044
(laughs)

31:21.046 --> 31:23.447
(chuckling) I'm definitely
not saying that.

31:23.449 --> 31:27.050
(projector and camera shutter
clicking)

31:27.052 --> 31:33.156
(cell phone ringing)

31:33.158 --> 31:34.458
(beep)

31:34.460 --> 31:36.627
(clears throat) hey.
I might lose you.

31:36.629 --> 31:38.528
There's barely any reception
up here.

31:38.530 --> 31:42.666
Yeah. Looks like I might be
here another 24 hours.

31:42.668 --> 31:44.601
That's too bad.

31:46.337 --> 31:48.038
Funny, I've only been
to montana once,

31:48.040 --> 31:49.506
But I seem to remember it
looking

31:49.508 --> 31:51.508
A lot different from this.

31:51.510 --> 31:53.510
More cattle, less bull.
Checking up on me now?

31:53.512 --> 31:55.512
If you didn't want to go,
why didn't you just say so

31:55.514 --> 31:57.614
Instead of lying to me again?
David--

31:57.616 --> 31:59.449
What? Come on,
let's hear your excuse.

31:59.451 --> 32:01.585
What is it this time?

32:01.587 --> 32:03.086
I'm sorry.

32:04.088 --> 32:05.455
So am I.

32:05.457 --> 32:07.491
(footsteps depart)

32:07.493 --> 32:09.226
I've narrowed
the president's location

32:09.228 --> 32:11.161
To a 100-mile radius where
he could have made it back

32:11.163 --> 32:12.629
In time to meet you
at your naval base

32:12.631 --> 32:14.364
Post-mission.
And?

32:14.366 --> 32:16.233
Iceland.

32:16.235 --> 32:18.135
Iceland?

32:18.137 --> 32:20.137
What the hell was he doing there
that he needed a cover for?

32:20.139 --> 32:21.505
I don't know.

32:21.507 --> 32:23.273
All right, check which
aircraft carriers

32:23.275 --> 32:25.609
Might have been off the coast
of iceland that day.

32:26.511 --> 32:29.413
(cell phone rings
and beeps)

32:29.415 --> 32:32.249
(jake) hey.
Take me
to the correspondents' dinner.

32:32.251 --> 32:33.417
(chuckles) no.

32:33.419 --> 32:35.085
Take me.

32:36.254 --> 32:37.554
Please.

32:39.624 --> 32:41.024
Okay.

32:41.026 --> 32:42.559
Okay.

32:42.561 --> 32:44.194
I'll pick you up at 6:00.

32:44.196 --> 32:45.629
(typing)

32:45.631 --> 32:47.331
Ah, that's good.

32:47.333 --> 32:49.032
That liv's got you,
that you're going.

32:49.034 --> 32:50.968
She needs this.

32:50.970 --> 32:54.137
(projector and camera shutter
clicking)

32:54.139 --> 32:57.741
(indistinct conversations
and laughter)

33:00.545 --> 33:02.512
You okay?

33:02.514 --> 33:04.514
So far, so good.
Good.

33:04.516 --> 33:06.183
Now we must find our table.

33:06.185 --> 33:07.684
(indistinct conversations)

33:07.686 --> 33:09.586
Right here.
Oh, good.

33:09.588 --> 33:10.988
We're the only ones here.

33:14.158 --> 33:16.426
Okay.
When can we sit?

33:19.764 --> 33:21.565
This flask belonged
to my great grand-daddy.

33:21.567 --> 33:23.567
You see that nick?

33:23.569 --> 33:25.369
This baby stopped
a yankee bullet

33:25.371 --> 33:27.237
From ripping right through
his heart.

33:29.040 --> 33:32.442
(lock clicks)
(projector and camera shutter
clicking)

33:32.444 --> 33:34.177
Madame vice president.

33:34.179 --> 33:36.013
Is the ladies' room
packed as usual?

33:36.015 --> 33:37.614
That's not fair.
Please feel free.

33:37.616 --> 33:40.183
I'm not here to urinate.
I need to talk.

33:40.185 --> 33:45.522
What if I were to run for
president of the United States?

33:45.524 --> 33:47.457
Hypothetically, of course.
(urinal flushes)

33:47.459 --> 33:50.227
(zips pants)
hypothetically?
You'd get clobbered.

33:50.229 --> 33:52.429
Sluttiness aside, grant is
still a sitting president

33:52.431 --> 33:54.297
From your own party
who to anyone's knowledge

33:54.299 --> 33:56.166
Has not done anything
illegal.

33:56.168 --> 33:58.502
Grant would kill you
in a republican primary.

33:58.504 --> 34:00.170
I'm not talking about
the primaries.

34:00.172 --> 34:02.305
What if I were to run
as an independent?

34:02.307 --> 34:04.474
You want to run for president
of the United States

34:04.476 --> 34:06.543
As a third party candidate?

34:06.545 --> 34:08.478
Hypothetically.

34:08.480 --> 34:10.313
So good to see you.
Thanks.

34:10.315 --> 34:11.615
Nice to meet you.

34:11.617 --> 34:14.051
(laughing)
(chuckles)

34:18.556 --> 34:19.623
Ahh.

34:21.125 --> 34:23.293
Go.

34:36.407 --> 34:38.075
(door beeps)

34:42.814 --> 34:45.115
(door closes)

34:45.117 --> 34:46.716
Olivia, thank you so much
for coming.

34:51.355 --> 34:53.256
Thank you. Thank you.

34:53.258 --> 34:55.759
I can't tell you how much
I relish this opportunity

34:55.761 --> 34:57.427
To finally say something
to you all

34:57.429 --> 35:00.764
That has been long,
long overdue.

35:00.766 --> 35:02.199
"you're welcome."

35:02.201 --> 35:04.401
(laughter)

35:04.403 --> 35:06.369
I like your new boyfriend.

35:06.371 --> 35:08.405
Is he married?

35:08.407 --> 35:12.142
No. Wait. Just--I'm sorry.
That was below the--

35:12.144 --> 35:13.477
I am sorry.

35:13.479 --> 35:16.279
Please. Stay. Sit.

35:16.281 --> 35:17.848
Hear me out.

35:17.850 --> 35:20.350
(laughter)

35:20.352 --> 35:22.419
I see many familiar faces
here tonight,

35:22.421 --> 35:24.488
Including a few
who inexplicably

35:24.490 --> 35:26.189
Haven't been accused
of sleeping with me.

35:26.191 --> 35:28.658
(laughter)

35:30.695 --> 35:31.895
I'd like you to come back

35:31.897 --> 35:33.430
And run fitz's
re-election campaign.

35:33.432 --> 35:34.764
What?

35:34.766 --> 35:36.399
Do you remember what it was
like four years ago,

35:36.401 --> 35:37.901
Liv, what we were like?

35:37.903 --> 35:41.805
Fresh and young
and full of ideas, and...

35:41.807 --> 35:45.509
Now, four years later--
my god, look at us.

35:45.511 --> 35:48.345
Congress has stalled everything
we've tried to push through,

35:48.347 --> 35:50.280
Approvals are in freefall,
people want change,

35:50.282 --> 35:52.149
And of course that's
exactly what the democrats

35:52.151 --> 35:53.450
Are running on,
but that's...

35:53.452 --> 35:54.851
(breathes deeply)

35:54.853 --> 35:56.486
I'm not even worried
about all that.

35:56.488 --> 35:58.788
Anyone can fix that.
That's not why he needs you.

35:58.790 --> 36:02.359
Mellie--
he needs you, olivia.

36:02.361 --> 36:07.364
He is tired and broken,
and...

36:07.366 --> 36:09.766
It isn't the job.

36:09.768 --> 36:11.501
It's doing the job
without you.

36:13.604 --> 36:16.406
He's not alive
when you're not here.

36:16.408 --> 36:20.443
He can't breathe
when you're not here.

36:20.445 --> 36:22.712
He doesn't have the will
to run, much less win,

36:22.714 --> 36:26.349
When you're not here,
because you... (gasps)

36:26.351 --> 36:28.518
(exhales)

36:30.288 --> 36:33.223
You're everything
to him, liv.

36:33.225 --> 36:35.492
He needs you.

36:35.494 --> 36:37.360
So I need you.

36:41.332 --> 36:42.399
Come back.

36:42.401 --> 36:44.734
Come back to us.

36:44.736 --> 36:46.436
(laughter)

36:46.438 --> 36:49.806
As you all know,
I'm running for re-election.

36:49.808 --> 36:51.541
Thank you.

36:51.543 --> 36:53.376
And out on the campaign trail,

36:53.378 --> 36:55.278
At every step of the way,

36:55.280 --> 36:57.347
The first lady will be
by my side.

36:57.349 --> 37:00.217
(applause)

37:00.219 --> 37:02.419
And believe me,
I mean <i>by my side.</i>

37:02.421 --> 37:04.654
(laughter)

37:04.656 --> 37:07.891
(voice breaking) does he know
what you're asking me?

37:08.993 --> 37:10.827
No.

37:10.829 --> 37:12.829
No, but...

37:12.831 --> 37:14.731
I'll get him on board.

37:14.733 --> 37:16.299
(chuckles)

37:16.301 --> 37:17.934
Of course he'll get on board.

37:19.904 --> 37:21.671
You and I,

37:21.673 --> 37:24.474
We've always wanted
the same thing, liv.

37:25.743 --> 37:29.579
For him to be the man
we both know he can be.

37:31.015 --> 37:32.983
And after what we did,
we owe him this.

37:34.285 --> 37:36.653
A chance to run
on his own steam.

37:36.655 --> 37:37.821
And win.

37:40.324 --> 37:42.292
(projector and camera shutter
clicking)

37:45.963 --> 37:47.330
(door closes, keys jangle)

37:47.332 --> 37:49.332
I thought I'd
surprise you tonight.

37:49.334 --> 37:51.968
I thought I'd just put on
this dress and come over.

37:51.970 --> 37:53.503
(sets keys down)

37:53.505 --> 37:56.806
Only I wasn't able
to get out of my car.

37:56.808 --> 37:58.742
I wanted to go with you
tonight.

37:58.744 --> 38:00.277
I wasn't lying about
that part.

38:00.279 --> 38:02.379
I just...

38:02.381 --> 38:07.550
I wanted to surprise you,
so... (singsongy) <i>surprise.</i>

38:07.552 --> 38:09.386
I saw your ex-husband
at the dinner.

38:09.388 --> 38:11.521
Why didn't you tell me
he'd be there?

38:13.891 --> 38:15.058
I'm sorry.

38:15.060 --> 38:17.327
Don't be sorry.

38:17.329 --> 38:19.629
Start telling me things.

38:19.631 --> 38:21.631
That's what normal people do.

38:23.601 --> 38:24.968
Not that we're
normal people.

38:24.970 --> 38:27.837
(laughs)

38:27.839 --> 38:30.407
(jake) you go ahead.
I'll get a taxi.

38:30.409 --> 38:32.575
What?
I wasn't
your date tonight.

38:32.577 --> 38:34.444
I was your excuse
so you could see him,

38:34.446 --> 38:35.779
And I knew you needed to,
so here I am.

38:35.781 --> 38:37.447
But dinner is over,
and I am done.

38:37.449 --> 38:39.849
Jake--
I don't play second fiddle
to anyone,

38:39.851 --> 38:41.618
Even the president.

38:41.620 --> 38:43.520
Good night, olivia.

38:46.357 --> 38:48.425
(cell phone chimes, beeps)

38:48.427 --> 38:51.628
Harrison, what are you doing
in the office this late?

38:51.630 --> 38:54.664
Candace and I talked
all day yesterday,

38:54.666 --> 38:56.633
And we're still a long way
from okay,

38:56.635 --> 38:58.668
But that's not why I'm here.

38:59.804 --> 39:02.505
I hated what I had to do
up on that stage.

39:02.507 --> 39:04.407
And I resent the hell
out of you

39:04.409 --> 39:06.843
For being right about
how to deal with it.

39:06.845 --> 39:10.480
But having that weight
off my shoulders--

39:10.482 --> 39:12.749
It's been freeing.

39:12.751 --> 39:14.551
What can we do for you,
josie?

39:14.553 --> 39:17.454
I think I can still
win this thing,

39:17.456 --> 39:19.589
And I want you by my side
when I do.

39:21.459 --> 39:24.661
As much as I appreciate
the offer, josie,

39:24.663 --> 39:26.830
I don't think I'm the right
person for the job.

39:28.766 --> 39:30.133
I respectfully disagree.

39:30.135 --> 39:32.469
So please just sleep on it.

39:32.471 --> 39:34.371
And if you wake up tomorrow

39:34.373 --> 39:37.374
And you feel the same way,
then tell me no.

39:37.376 --> 39:38.508
Okay.

39:42.980 --> 39:46.383
What the hell
are you doing?
(door closes)

40:04.702 --> 40:07.537
(projector and camera shutter
clicking)

40:13.644 --> 40:16.613
(keys jangle)

40:16.615 --> 40:18.448
(keys clatter)

40:18.450 --> 40:19.549
(exhales)

40:28.092 --> 40:30.059
How was the dinner?

40:30.061 --> 40:31.828
Did it make liv happy?

40:31.830 --> 40:33.763
She's happy, yeah.

40:33.765 --> 40:35.465
But not 'cause of me.

40:37.601 --> 40:39.702
Thought I sent you home.

40:39.704 --> 40:41.204
I came back,

40:41.206 --> 40:42.906
'cause I think I figured
something out.

40:42.908 --> 40:44.707
The reason why fitz
was in iceland,

40:44.709 --> 40:46.643
The reason he lied about
being in iran

40:46.645 --> 40:48.978
During operation remington.

40:48.980 --> 40:50.980
I think I figured out
what the cover-up is.

40:52.116 --> 40:53.716
Tell me, huck.

40:55.119 --> 40:56.619
Huck,

40:56.621 --> 40:58.721
What was fitz doing
in iceland?

40:59.924 --> 41:02.158
There was a plane crash
that day.

41:02.160 --> 41:05.228
Couple of hundred miles
off the coast of iceland.

41:05.230 --> 41:09.032
A 747 carrying
329 passengers.

41:09.034 --> 41:11.034
They attributed it
to mechanical failure,

41:11.036 --> 41:13.203
But a fisherman reported
flares in the sky,

41:13.205 --> 41:15.004
None of which I was able
to confirm,

41:15.006 --> 41:17.006
Because all of the satellite
footage of those coordinates

41:17.008 --> 41:18.508
Had been erased.

41:18.510 --> 41:19.843
You're suggesting...

41:19.845 --> 41:21.244
The president shot it down

41:21.246 --> 41:23.847
On behalf
of the u.S. Government.

41:23.849 --> 41:25.148
Why, I don't know,

41:25.150 --> 41:26.716
But that's what the evidence
is telling me.

41:32.022 --> 41:33.690
(jake) and by evidence,
you mean...

41:33.692 --> 41:36.092
These two coincidences--
the location of the crash

41:36.094 --> 41:37.594
And the missing
satellite footage?

41:37.596 --> 41:39.963
Two things
make a coincidence.

41:39.965 --> 41:41.631
Three things
make a conspiracy.

41:41.633 --> 41:43.533
What's the third thing?
(huck exhales)

41:49.974 --> 41:52.842
The passenger list.

41:52.844 --> 41:55.044
Fifth name from the top.

41:56.647 --> 41:58.214
"maya lewis."

41:58.216 --> 42:00.650
She never took
her husband's name.

42:00.652 --> 42:02.151
What was her husband's name?

42:02.153 --> 42:04.554
Pope.

42:05.523 --> 42:06.789
No.

42:06.791 --> 42:08.858
Liv's mom.

42:13.030 --> 42:14.664
(knock on door)

42:17.535 --> 42:19.869
What?

42:23.874 --> 42:27.277
(projector and camera shutter
clicking)
