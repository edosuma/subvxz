00:35.980 --> 00:37.220
Figures.
She's not here.

00:37.220 --> 00:38.980
Probably too afraid
to face us.

00:38.980 --> 00:40.500
What are you guys
talking about?

00:40.500 --> 00:42.020
Betty Ann.

00:42.020 --> 00:43.380
What did she do?

00:43.380 --> 00:45.420
Betty Ann: She wouldn't
let her friends

00:45.420 --> 00:46.580
sneak into a movie.

00:47.980 --> 00:50.220
We were coming out
of one movie theater,

00:50.220 --> 00:52.220
and the next one's
right there.

00:52.220 --> 00:53.780
The door was open.
We were in.

00:53.780 --> 00:56.060
But I didn't
want to do it.

00:56.060 --> 00:59.060
So she yells out, "hey,
guys, this way out."

00:59.060 --> 01:01.380
The Usher sees us--
bang, we're dead.

01:01.380 --> 01:02.620
If you didn't
want to go,

01:02.620 --> 01:04.500
you should have
stayed quiet.

01:05.860 --> 01:08.780
I'm not so sure
about that.

01:08.780 --> 01:10.980
I really thought
it was wrong.

01:12.380 --> 01:13.540
So I had a choice.

01:16.300 --> 01:18.540
Should I stand up
for what's right?

01:21.500 --> 01:23.620
Or stay silent?

01:23.620 --> 01:24.980
I hope this is
about your story.

01:24.980 --> 01:27.180
It is, kind of.

01:27.180 --> 01:29.460
Silence is power--

01:29.460 --> 01:32.980
the power of the unknown,
the unspoken.

01:32.980 --> 01:37.940
Silence can be a blessing,
a welcome moment of peace,

01:37.940 --> 01:40.340
or it can be evil.

01:43.180 --> 01:45.900
The trick is to know
when to welcome it,

01:45.900 --> 01:48.420
or be very afraid.

01:49.460 --> 01:51.220
Submitted
for the approval

01:51.220 --> 01:52.740
of the Midnight Society,

01:52.740 --> 01:55.140
I call this story...

02:24.740 --> 02:26.740
What have you done?

02:26.740 --> 02:29.740
It attacked me.
It's here.

02:31.780 --> 02:34.420
<i> Calo vecto sollemnis.</i>

02:36.020 --> 02:39.140
The words don't work.

02:40.820 --> 02:43.860
[Rattling]

02:43.860 --> 02:48.740
I told you never
to reveal yourself.

02:51.940 --> 02:55.580
I command you, be still.

02:57.180 --> 02:59.460
I'll return for you later.

02:59.460 --> 03:02.540
[Chuckling]

03:02.540 --> 03:05.940
After I take care
of our friend George.

03:09.660 --> 03:11.540
<i>Betty Ann: Jarred Conner
was visiting</i>

03:11.540 --> 03:13.860
<i> his cousin Ann's farm
for the summer.</i>

03:13.860 --> 03:15.460
<i> Jarred's greatest love
was baseball.</i>

03:15.460 --> 03:17.780
<i> All he wanted to do
was play.</i>

03:17.780 --> 03:19.340
<i> Unfortunately for Ann,</i>

03:19.340 --> 03:23.060
<i> baseball was not
her favorite pastime.</i>

03:23.060 --> 03:24.700
Let's quit. I'm tired.

03:24.700 --> 03:26.300
Just throw the ball.

03:32.860 --> 03:34.500
Go back for a long one.

03:34.500 --> 03:36.980
Aw, jarred.

03:36.980 --> 03:40.260
You a wimp, or what?

03:40.260 --> 03:41.740
Farther.

03:53.060 --> 03:54.460
[Glass shatters]

04:03.540 --> 04:05.140
I told her not
to go back so far.

04:05.140 --> 04:07.140
There's too much work
to be doing right now

04:07.140 --> 04:09.780
for you to be causing
trouble, young lady.

04:09.780 --> 04:12.260
I got a crop to get in.

04:12.260 --> 04:13.860
I know. I'm sorry.

04:13.860 --> 04:17.420
You both have to work off
the price of a new window.

04:17.420 --> 04:18.740
Mark? Take their gloves.

04:18.740 --> 04:20.700
Aw, you can't.

04:23.180 --> 04:26.300
As I see it, it takes
2 to play catch.

04:26.300 --> 04:27.820
Now, there'll be
no more baseball

04:27.820 --> 04:30.460
until you show
some responsibility.

04:30.460 --> 04:32.620
Hey, nice glove.
Maybe I'll use it

04:32.620 --> 04:34.620
at my softball tournament
this weekend.

04:34.620 --> 04:36.780
You better not.

04:36.780 --> 04:39.420
Hey, hey, cool it.
I was only joking.

04:39.420 --> 04:42.580
Settle down. No one's
gonna use your glove.

04:42.580 --> 04:45.980
Now toss those things
in the tractor.

04:47.700 --> 04:51.420
Now, you 2 have
some work to do.

04:51.420 --> 04:54.300
Start by taking some beans
to Mr. Galloway down the road.

04:54.300 --> 04:55.660
This isn't fair.

04:55.660 --> 04:57.660
Well, breaking my window
wasn't fair.

04:57.660 --> 05:00.700
And tomorrow, I want
you both to help mark

05:00.700 --> 05:02.660
build a fence
around the garden.

05:02.660 --> 05:05.100
Isn't there an easier way
to keep the deer out?

05:05.100 --> 05:08.900
None that I can think of.
Now get going.

05:23.100 --> 05:24.700
Cool barn.

05:24.700 --> 05:26.820
It's old man
Earlstead's.

05:26.820 --> 05:28.140
Let's check it out.

05:28.140 --> 05:29.260
No.

05:29.260 --> 05:31.100
Why? Scared?

05:31.100 --> 05:33.540
Jarred, we got
to deliver--jarred!

05:38.820 --> 05:40.740
It's Mr. Earlstead's.

05:40.740 --> 05:43.580
People say that he was
some kind of sorcerer,

05:43.580 --> 05:46.140
and that he had invisible
servants work his farm.

05:46.140 --> 05:49.260
And you believe that stuff?

05:49.260 --> 05:50.020
No.

05:50.820 --> 05:52.820
Yeah, right.

06:09.300 --> 06:10.700
This is great.

06:10.700 --> 06:13.220
We could make a dugout
for our baseball field

06:13.220 --> 06:14.820
with these boards.

06:16.340 --> 06:17.340
Let's go.

06:18.980 --> 06:20.580
Give me a hand.

06:33.300 --> 06:34.540
[Screams]

06:35.660 --> 06:37.220
Ooh, bogeyman.

06:37.220 --> 06:38.620
Let's get out of here.

06:38.620 --> 06:42.220
No way. We could hang the
scarecrow in the garden

06:42.220 --> 06:43.860
instead of building
a fence.

06:43.860 --> 06:46.500
Scarecrows scare crows,
not deer.

06:46.500 --> 06:47.900
You're just scared.

06:47.900 --> 06:48.940
I am not.

06:55.220 --> 06:56.940
You gonna help me,
or what?

06:59.740 --> 07:01.420
Hey, wait.

07:17.380 --> 07:18.380
OK.

07:28.540 --> 07:31.420
This isn't
such a hot idea.

07:31.420 --> 07:33.180
Hey, what's going on,
you guys?

07:35.260 --> 07:37.860
It'll keep the deer
from eating the vegetables.

07:37.860 --> 07:41.540
Nice try. You still got
to help me build the fence.

07:41.540 --> 07:42.660
I told you.

07:42.660 --> 07:45.780
Did Mr. Galloway
give you that?

07:45.780 --> 07:47.380
We never went.

07:47.380 --> 07:50.380
We kind of
got sidetracked.

07:50.380 --> 07:52.660
You best be on your bikes
and start peddling,

07:52.660 --> 07:54.300
unless you want to spend

07:54.300 --> 07:56.500
the rest of the summer
doing chores.

08:05.580 --> 08:06.380
There it is.

08:08.420 --> 08:11.020
We better hurry or
Dad's gonna kill us.

08:11.020 --> 08:12.660
Good death comes

08:12.660 --> 08:13.980
to those who wait.

08:13.980 --> 08:15.860
We were just...

08:15.860 --> 08:19.260
The dragons have been stolen.

08:19.260 --> 08:21.700
Have you seen my dragons?

08:21.700 --> 08:23.460
We haven't
seen any dragons.

08:23.460 --> 08:25.940
The better for you then.

08:28.020 --> 08:29.620
Such sorrow.

08:31.420 --> 08:33.659
I used to see
rainbow-colored lights,

08:33.659 --> 08:37.020
but now... darkness.

08:38.539 --> 08:42.700
Such sweeping blackness.

08:42.700 --> 08:44.340
He made me this way.

08:44.340 --> 08:48.700
His evil was contagious.

08:48.700 --> 08:52.340
He raised the silent servant.

08:52.340 --> 08:54.460
<i> Calo vecto sollemnis.</i>

08:54.460 --> 08:58.100
But I was too clever
for them.

08:58.100 --> 09:02.180
The power was between
the dragons.

09:02.180 --> 09:05.140
They could stalk
the silent servant.

09:05.140 --> 09:09.140
Always the master
could break the spell,

09:09.140 --> 09:10.540
but he's dead.

09:10.540 --> 09:12.060
[Sobbing]

09:12.060 --> 09:13.300
There...

09:15.380 --> 09:17.820
The servant walks.

09:21.140 --> 09:26.540
Be forewarned.
Once the word is given,

09:26.540 --> 09:29.700
it cannot be undone.

09:29.700 --> 09:32.980
It is always listening.

09:35.660 --> 09:36.500
Always listening.

09:41.860 --> 09:46.180
<i> Calo vecto sollemnis.</i>

09:46.180 --> 09:49.380
The servant
will hear it never more,

09:49.380 --> 09:51.660
for the true master
is dead...

09:52.860 --> 09:56.460
And the beast runs free.

09:56.460 --> 09:59.820
[Hysterical laughter]

10:12.220 --> 10:14.020
Who was that?

10:14.020 --> 10:15.540
Crazy George.

10:15.540 --> 10:18.580
He was Mr. Earlstead's
foreman, until--

10:18.580 --> 10:20.220
until he went
crazy, probably.

10:20.220 --> 10:23.460
Man, what a loon.

10:23.460 --> 10:24.700
Ouch.

10:24.700 --> 10:26.820
What is it?

10:26.820 --> 10:28.580
It fell off the scarecrow.

10:28.580 --> 10:30.500
Look, dragons.

10:34.060 --> 10:35.660
We should bring it back.

10:35.660 --> 10:37.660
Something's inside.

10:37.660 --> 10:39.460
Jarred, don't.

10:41.100 --> 10:42.180
Cool.

10:44.100 --> 10:46.300
"He who recites
that which is written,

10:46.300 --> 10:49.940
shall summon
the silent one hither."

10:49.940 --> 10:52.260
Kind of Shakespeare-like.

10:52.260 --> 10:54.020
I don't think
you should.

10:54.020 --> 10:55.380
"Awaken slumbering servant.

10:55.380 --> 10:58.900
Awaken, say your master."

10:58.900 --> 11:01.700
"Abide by ye
true master's word,

11:01.700 --> 11:04.900
"and hold ye bound
by this incantation.

11:04.900 --> 11:08.180
Never turn back
upon thy mission."

11:10.580 --> 11:11.780
Maybe we shouldn't.

11:11.780 --> 11:13.500
"Thy power, the word.

11:13.500 --> 11:15.860
<i> "Calo vecto sollemnis.</i>

11:15.860 --> 11:19.140
"As thy true master
divides the dragons,

11:19.140 --> 11:21.620
and sets thy silent
servant to rest."

11:21.620 --> 11:23.220
Enough.

11:33.780 --> 11:36.420
This must have been
Mr. Earlstead's.

11:36.420 --> 11:40.100
Who cares? When do you think
we'll get our gloves back?

11:40.100 --> 11:42.260
[Knocking]

11:42.260 --> 11:44.780
Hello. Anyone home?

11:50.220 --> 11:52.820
I'm only home
for a bite to eat.

11:52.820 --> 11:54.740
Would you 2 take out
the garbage?

12:00.020 --> 12:03.180
You don't think all that
silent servant stuff is real?

12:03.180 --> 12:05.460
I wish. I'm sick
of doing chores.

12:05.460 --> 12:07.180
[Footsteps]

12:07.180 --> 12:09.060
Mark?

12:12.660 --> 12:14.460
[Both scream]

12:19.060 --> 12:20.500
Whoa, what's the rush?

12:20.500 --> 12:22.580
It's the scarecrow--
alive, I swear.

12:22.580 --> 12:24.460
The silent it came
servant-- after us.

12:24.460 --> 12:26.900
Whoa. One at a time.

12:26.900 --> 12:28.460
There's a scarecrow,

12:28.460 --> 12:29.580
and we hung
it in the garden.

12:29.580 --> 12:31.860
There's a scroll,
and Jarred read it,

12:31.860 --> 12:33.300
and now it's alive!

12:33.300 --> 12:35.900
Why don't you guys
show it to me?

12:41.900 --> 12:44.660
It was standing
right here.

12:47.740 --> 12:49.220
There's you man.

12:49.220 --> 12:52.740
Doesn't look like
he's going anywhere too fast.

12:52.740 --> 12:55.500
It was alive.
I saw it too.

12:55.500 --> 12:57.820
Come on, you guys.
Dad probably just took it down

12:57.820 --> 12:59.460
and put it over here,

12:59.460 --> 13:01.820
and when you guys
came by, it fell, that's all.

13:01.820 --> 13:03.900
You guys want me
to help you hang it back up?

13:03.900 --> 13:05.100
No, thanks.

13:05.100 --> 13:07.740
OK, then, don't stay up
too late.

13:07.740 --> 13:10.420
I got that new glass
for the window.

13:10.420 --> 13:12.620
We'll fix it
first thing tomorrow.

13:12.620 --> 13:14.460
Night, guys.

13:17.540 --> 13:19.740
You never should have
broken that window.

13:19.740 --> 13:21.980
You're the one who
threw the ball.

13:21.980 --> 13:24.780
You should
have caught it.

13:28.460 --> 13:30.620
Why don't you
fix the window?

13:30.620 --> 13:32.620
You're supposed
to be the servant.

13:32.620 --> 13:33.780
Let's go in.

13:35.580 --> 13:39.140
And deliver the stupid beans,
while you're at it.

13:56.020 --> 13:58.260
Yes. Uncle Pete must
have fixed it.

13:58.260 --> 14:00.300
Wasn't me.

14:00.300 --> 14:01.900
Hmm.

14:01.900 --> 14:04.420
Mark must have had
pity on you 2.

14:04.420 --> 14:07.660
Oh, Mr. Galloway called and
thanked us for those beans.

14:10.260 --> 14:13.180
Does this mean we can go
to mark's softball game?

14:13.180 --> 14:15.460
Sure. Right after
you put in

14:15.460 --> 14:18.460
a good day's work
on the fence.

14:36.900 --> 14:39.700
We'll finish tomorrow.
I got to get to my game.

14:39.700 --> 14:40.740
Can I go?

14:40.740 --> 14:43.300
Sure. Ann, you want
to come too?

14:43.300 --> 14:45.100
No, I got stuff to do.

14:45.100 --> 14:46.100
Suit yourself, then.

14:46.100 --> 14:47.100
Bring the tools.

14:47.100 --> 14:49.860
I'm gonna go
get my gear.

14:49.860 --> 14:52.580
I don't want to have
to do this tomorrow.

14:52.580 --> 14:54.860
Don't say that
to the silent servant.

14:54.860 --> 14:56.820
Yeah, right.
Like it exists?

14:56.820 --> 14:58.420
Jarred, mark didn't
fix the door,

14:58.420 --> 15:01.300
and it sure wasn't us who
took the beans to Mr. Galloway.

15:01.300 --> 15:02.740
I don't believe it.

15:02.740 --> 15:05.860
Then how else
do you explain it?

15:09.060 --> 15:12.340
OK, let's see.

15:12.340 --> 15:13.660
Jarred, don't.

15:17.620 --> 15:20.860
I command you:
Finish this fence.

15:20.860 --> 15:22.620
Take it back.

15:22.620 --> 15:25.980
You heard what George
said, it's evil.

15:25.980 --> 15:28.340
George is crazy.

15:28.340 --> 15:30.780
What's your excuse?

15:37.900 --> 15:40.500
"Only the true master
can separate the dragons

15:40.500 --> 15:43.460
and dispel the magic."

15:54.940 --> 15:56.740
How'd you guys do it?

15:57.780 --> 15:59.140
Do what?

16:06.940 --> 16:08.380
This is great.

16:08.380 --> 16:11.180
I didn't know you
guys had it in you.

16:11.180 --> 16:12.420
Pretty good, huh?

16:12.420 --> 16:15.220
This just bought you guys
the afternoon off.

16:15.220 --> 16:16.660
Nice work.

16:18.340 --> 16:19.500
Oh, baby.

16:22.860 --> 16:24.420
Don't ask anything.
It's evil.

16:24.420 --> 16:26.620
Evil? It's excellent.

16:26.620 --> 16:29.260
This our ticket
to the best summer ever.

16:29.260 --> 16:30.300
But the scroll--

16:30.300 --> 16:32.620
I command you:
Build me a dugout

16:32.620 --> 16:34.820
for my baseball field
out back.

16:34.820 --> 16:38.180
<i> Calo vecto sollemnis.
Cancel the command.</i>

16:38.180 --> 16:39.420
<i> Calo what?</i>

16:39.420 --> 16:41.940
It's in the scroll.
This is dangerous.

16:41.940 --> 16:43.500
Get over it.

16:43.500 --> 16:47.340
I'm getting a dugout.
Let's go into town.

16:47.340 --> 16:50.780
There's a baseball card shop
I want to check out.

17:05.980 --> 17:07.099
Yeah.

17:08.540 --> 17:11.460
I told you.
This is great.

17:11.460 --> 17:13.780
Jarred, where did
these boards come from?

17:13.780 --> 17:14.780
Who cares?

17:14.780 --> 17:17.180
We got
a real field now.

17:17.180 --> 17:21.099
Mark: Ann and Jarred,
get over here now!

17:23.940 --> 17:26.339
You guys want to explain this?

17:34.980 --> 17:36.340
It was the scarecrow,
honest.

17:36.340 --> 17:38.780
We didn't know it would
wreck the fence.

17:38.780 --> 17:41.780
Come on, you guys.
Come up with a better story.

17:41.780 --> 17:44.180
It's the truth.
Mr. Earlstead--

17:44.180 --> 17:46.940
Sorry. I have
to ground you 2.

17:46.940 --> 17:48.940
But I was going
to your game tonight.

17:48.940 --> 17:51.620
I don't think so.
Here are your gloves.

17:51.620 --> 17:53.260
Stay out of trouble.

18:03.940 --> 18:05.860
I don't believe it.

18:05.860 --> 18:07.260
What?

18:07.260 --> 18:11.300
My glove's not here.
Mark's still got it.

18:11.300 --> 18:14.140
Come on, mark wouldn't
take your glove.

18:14.140 --> 18:17.140
I'd like
to kill whoever did.

18:20.220 --> 18:21.300
Jarred?

18:21.300 --> 18:24.580
No way. That wasn't
an order.

18:28.220 --> 18:30.460
Aw, man, that thing's
going after Mark.

18:30.460 --> 18:32.100
We got to stop it.

18:32.100 --> 18:36.140
How? You couldn't stop it
from building the dugout.

18:36.140 --> 18:38.820
Only the true master
can stop the servant.

18:38.820 --> 18:40.460
The power's in the tube.

18:40.460 --> 18:41.860
Then smash it.

18:45.660 --> 18:47.580
The dragons have
to be separated.

18:47.580 --> 18:50.500
<i> Calo vecto sollemnis.</i>

18:53.260 --> 18:54.820
We got to warn Mark.

18:54.820 --> 18:56.820
The game'll
be over by now,

18:56.820 --> 18:58.580
but I know where he'll be.

19:12.580 --> 19:14.660
Congratulations.
That was some pitch.

19:47.660 --> 19:49.260
Hey, you guys
are grounded.

19:49.260 --> 19:51.740
The scarecrow is after
you. We can't stop it.

19:51.740 --> 19:53.500
What are you talking about?

19:53.500 --> 19:55.220
It's 'cause you have
my glove.

19:55.220 --> 19:56.620
I gave you your glove.

19:56.620 --> 19:59.460
No. There were tractor
parts in that bag.

19:59.460 --> 20:04.060
Tractor parts? Oh, I guess
I gave you the wrong bag.

20:04.060 --> 20:06.660
Then where are the gloves?

20:20.900 --> 20:23.300
Gee. What the heck?

20:26.620 --> 20:27.780
What in blazes?

20:27.780 --> 20:28.900
Where is he?

20:28.900 --> 20:31.340
I don't know.
He could be anywhere.

20:31.340 --> 20:33.340
Dad's in a lot of trouble.

20:33.340 --> 20:35.820
We got to get
to Earlstead's barn.

20:37.580 --> 20:39.660
What's going on?

20:39.660 --> 20:42.340
Forget it. We got
to find Uncle Pete.

20:42.340 --> 20:44.180
That'll take hours.
We don't have enough time.

20:44.180 --> 20:45.380
Listen, Ann--

20:45.380 --> 20:47.700
No. I've listened
to you long enough.

20:47.700 --> 20:49.780
We're doing this my way.

21:03.980 --> 21:06.700
Only the true master
can separate the dragons.

21:06.700 --> 21:08.700
But Earlstead
is dead.

21:08.700 --> 21:10.620
Exactly.

21:42.580 --> 21:45.500
Only the true master
can separate the dragons.

21:57.100 --> 21:59.700
<i> Calo vecto sollemnis.</i>

22:01.020 --> 22:03.180
Go back where you came from.

22:22.820 --> 22:24.460
What in blazes?

22:29.460 --> 22:31.500
Would you mind telling me
what's going on?

22:31.500 --> 22:36.500
Sure. I'll tell you
all about it tomorrow,

22:36.500 --> 22:39.100
while Jarred
rebuilds his fence.

22:56.540 --> 22:59.380
[Laughing]

23:03.620 --> 23:04.580
The end.

23:04.580 --> 23:07.780
Great. I declare
this meeting

23:07.780 --> 23:10.100
of the Midnight Society
closed.

23:10.100 --> 23:11.620
Good story, Bett.

23:11.620 --> 23:12.700
Thanks.

23:12.700 --> 23:16.460
[Whispering]

23:22.180 --> 23:23.580
Uh...

23:23.580 --> 23:26.260
We were thinking
-- you want to go to a movie tomorrow?

23:26.260 --> 23:28.020
You're kidding.

23:28.020 --> 23:29.660
No, and we'll
buy the tickets.

23:29.660 --> 23:30.860
You don't have to do that.

23:30.860 --> 23:31.860
Yeah, we do.

23:31.860 --> 23:34.060
Wow. Thanks, guys.

23:34.060 --> 23:36.620
No problem, except
I pick the flick.

23:39.500 --> 23:41.540
What? I pick
good movies.

23:41.540 --> 23:42.700
Yeah.

23:42.700 --> 23:45.060
It's gonna have
action, big car chase.
