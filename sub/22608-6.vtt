00:15.840 --> 00:16.920
Africa.

00:19.000 --> 00:21.999
In the four years
of making this series,

00:22.000 --> 00:24.439
we've been to some
astonishing places

00:24.440 --> 00:28.840
and seen animals behaving in ways
that have never been filmed before.

00:35.640 --> 00:38.280
But Africa has another story
to tell.

00:39.840 --> 00:42.039
The wildlife of this continent

00:42.040 --> 00:44.919
has seen more changes
in the last 50 years

00:44.920 --> 00:48.200
than it has in the last two million.

00:51.160 --> 00:54.719
Changing landscapes
and changing climate.

00:54.720 --> 00:58.159
Today's animals are facing
unprecedented challenges.

00:58.160 --> 01:02.079
Whilst around them,
Africa's human population

01:02.080 --> 01:05.438
is growing at nearly double
the global rate.

01:08.040 --> 01:10.919
There is an increasing urgency
to understand

01:10.920 --> 01:16.159
and, crucially, to conserve the
wildlife of this great continent.

01:17.560 --> 01:21.679
Today, there is a new generation
of naturalists and scientists

01:21.680 --> 01:24.719
who are fighting
to save the wild places

01:24.720 --> 01:26.599
and the animals that live in them.

01:26.600 --> 01:28.199
One, two, three!

01:28.200 --> 01:31.919
This is the greatest wildlife
continent on the planet

01:31.920 --> 01:36.039
and what happens here
is relevant to us all.

01:36.040 --> 01:40.240
So what is the future
of wild Africa?

01:43.144 --> 01:47.927
Episode 6: The Future
Original Air Date: February 6th, 2013

01:56.880 --> 02:01.239
This animal has become the world's
number-one target for poachers.

02:01.240 --> 02:05.159
Its kind has been hunted almost
to the point of extinction.

02:05.160 --> 02:08.799
It's now so rare
that this individual is watched over

02:08.800 --> 02:11.319
day and night.

02:11.320 --> 02:15.279
This is the black rhinoceros.

02:15.280 --> 02:20.119
And black rhinoceros are notorious
for being rather grumpy

02:20.120 --> 02:21.880
and suddenly charging.

02:24.440 --> 02:27.079
But he is in great danger,

02:27.080 --> 02:29.520
because he has on his nose...

02:30.920 --> 02:33.040
that horn...

02:37.200 --> 02:39.880
which is worth its weight in gold.

02:45.680 --> 02:48.759
The demand for rhino horn
has rocketed.

02:48.760 --> 02:52.319
There has been a 3,000% increase
in poaching

02:52.320 --> 02:54.640
just in the last five years.

02:56.160 --> 03:01.440
Today, powdered rhino horn
can fetch up to 65,000 a kilo.

03:03.120 --> 03:06.760
Rhinos are a lucrative target
for organised crime.

03:07.920 --> 03:12.279
In Chinese medicine, it's believed
that rhino horn can reduce fever

03:12.280 --> 03:14.839
and some Vietnamese sell it
as a cure for everything,

03:14.840 --> 03:17.039
from cancer to hangovers.

03:17.040 --> 03:21.159
It's made of keratin,
the same substance as hair and nail,

03:21.160 --> 03:24.759
and it has no clinically proven
medicinal value.

03:29.080 --> 03:32.640
But it has made every black rhino
in Africa a target.

03:33.760 --> 03:38.279
They've all been killed
in Uganda and Rwanda,

03:38.280 --> 03:41.280
and there are only around
600 left here in Kenya.

03:44.320 --> 03:47.999
But these are not poachers.

03:48.000 --> 03:49.959
These are protectors.

03:58.680 --> 04:03.959
And that protection is overseen
by rhino expert Dr. Matthew Mutinda,

04:03.960 --> 04:07.760
one of the Kenya Wildlife Services'
top vets.

04:09.320 --> 04:12.839
"Black rhinos
are critically endangered."

04:12.840 --> 04:16.959
That is what here, at Lewa Wildlife
Conservancy, we're trying to do...

04:16.959 --> 04:18.959
save the animal,

04:18.959 --> 04:22.039
provide a safe and secure sanctuary

04:22.040 --> 04:25.520
where the animal can breed
and live freely.

04:27.040 --> 04:30.119
There aren't many true wild rhinos
left in Africa.

04:30.120 --> 04:33.319
Most, like these,
in Lewa Wildlife Conservancy,

04:33.320 --> 04:35.240
are under armed guard.

04:36.800 --> 04:38.680
This young female
has reached the age

04:38.681 --> 04:40.759
when Matthew must do
some health checks,

04:40.760 --> 04:43.519
including taking blood samples.

04:43.520 --> 04:46.719
This will help deter
poachers and traffickers,

04:46.720 --> 04:50.079
as DNA in illegally traded
rhino horn

04:50.080 --> 04:52.280
can be tracked back to its origin.

04:53.920 --> 04:57.959
If you have to do
anaesthesia in the wild,

04:57.960 --> 05:00.720
you will expect some degree of risk.

05:01.880 --> 05:04.919
This female has reacted badly
to the anaesthetic.

05:07.520 --> 05:09.679
She's not breathing.

05:09.680 --> 05:12.960
It's a rare and extremely serious
situation.

05:14.480 --> 05:17.160
He knows that the next few minutes
are crucial.

05:19.680 --> 05:21.439
And when an animal is this big,

05:21.440 --> 05:23.800
there's only one way to get
the heart going again

05:23.801 --> 05:25.920
when you're out in the bush.

05:31.480 --> 05:33.719
Thanks to Matthew's quick thinking,

05:33.720 --> 05:36.200
they can hear
that she is breathing again.

05:39.440 --> 05:42.200
They've got to get her
back on her feet.

05:59.000 --> 06:01.440
Not surprisingly,
she is disorientated.

06:15.240 --> 06:17.000
Mission accomplished.

06:18.840 --> 06:20.239
It's been an ordeal,

06:20.240 --> 06:22.999
but now, this rhino can be
tracked and protected

06:23.000 --> 06:24.200
for the rest of her life.

06:24.201 --> 06:28.760
Within minutes, she's grazing
peacefully again with her mother.

06:30.240 --> 06:33.239
It may seem heartless
to treat an animal like that,

06:33.240 --> 06:36.679
but we have to keep tabs on them
and be able to identify individuals.

06:36.680 --> 06:38.279
They're in great danger.

06:38.280 --> 06:40.759
Even now, on average,

06:40.760 --> 06:45.440
one rhino is killed by poachers
every day in Africa.

06:48.840 --> 06:51.999
There are so few black rhino
left in Kenya

06:52.000 --> 06:54.960
that we're getting to know
each individual.

06:59.120 --> 07:02.600
But this is still a creature
that can surprise us.

07:06.800 --> 07:08.719
Previously, it was widely believed

07:08.720 --> 07:12.680
that black rhinos were largely
solitary creatures.

07:15.720 --> 07:19.599
Here, in the Kalahari,
a starlight camera reveals

07:19.600 --> 07:23.159
that they may be much more sociable
than many thought.

07:29.080 --> 07:33.640
This water-hole gathering is an
enchanting window into the past.

07:40.320 --> 07:44.279
Early explorers reported seeing
a rhino behind every bush.

07:44.280 --> 07:46.439
Before the invention of the gun,

07:46.440 --> 07:49.559
there were probably
hundreds of thousands of rhinos

07:49.560 --> 07:51.200
across the continent.

07:53.760 --> 07:56.879
The people protecting rhinos
in Africa are striving to ensure

07:56.880 --> 08:01.439
that we'll still be able to witness
wonderful scenes like this

08:01.440 --> 08:03.400
in 50 years' time.

08:10.040 --> 08:13.479
Right across Africa,
conservationists have realised

08:13.480 --> 08:18.359
that if we want to save our
big animals, then now is the time.

08:18.360 --> 08:20.919
The human population
of the continent

08:20.920 --> 08:23.279
has just exceeded one billion

08:23.280 --> 08:27.199
and many wild animals are being
hunted commercially for food.

08:27.200 --> 08:29.239
Some, legally,

08:29.240 --> 08:31.599
but many, illegally.

08:34.080 --> 08:38.080
Wildlife meat is often sold
as goat or beef.

08:39.320 --> 08:41.078
The amount is astonishing.

08:41.080 --> 08:44.479
Millions of tonnes are eaten
across Africa every year.

08:44.480 --> 08:46.159
At this rate, some species

08:46.160 --> 08:48.840
are almost certainly heading
for extinction.

08:52.560 --> 08:56.319
But commercial hunting is not
just affecting the grazers.

08:56.320 --> 09:00.440
As the prey decreases,
it's affecting the predators too.

09:01.600 --> 09:03.279
50 years ago,

09:03.280 --> 09:07.759
there were about half a million
lions in Africa.

09:07.760 --> 09:10.999
Today, there are less than 30,000.

09:11.000 --> 09:13.519
But in one particular
part of Africa,

09:13.520 --> 09:16.760
things are improving
in a quite extraordinary way.

09:24.920 --> 09:29.680
These hunters have become part
of a new and unlikely alliance.

09:31.080 --> 09:35.440
In recent years, hungry lions have
increasingly been killing livestock.

09:38.240 --> 09:43.640
One group of traditional Maasai have
reacted in a very untraditional way.

09:45.280 --> 09:50.159
The Maasai are cattle herders
who don't eat wild animals.

09:50.160 --> 09:54.720
But when lions attack their herds,
they've always retaliated.

09:56.280 --> 10:00.240
Maasai and lions
are ancient adversaries.

10:01.640 --> 10:05.439
A lion hunt is still a rite of
passage for young Maasai warriors

10:05.440 --> 10:07.080
like Olubi Lairumbe.

10:11.520 --> 10:13.559
For me and any Maasai,

10:13.560 --> 10:15.959
killing a lion
is the ultimate fulfilment

10:15.960 --> 10:20.039
of a truly accomplished Maasai.

10:20.040 --> 10:24.959
Nothing compares to that.

10:24.960 --> 10:28.719
There is nobody who knows more
about living alongside lions

10:28.720 --> 10:30.919
than the Maasai themselves.

10:30.920 --> 10:34.439
I met Olubi and some of the other
warriors in his village

10:34.440 --> 10:38.719
to find out about their relationship
with the local pride.

10:38.720 --> 10:41.760
How many lions are there
around here?

10:44.240 --> 10:47.119
Around here,
there are about 100.

10:47.120 --> 10:49.520
So they all have names?

10:54.040 --> 10:58.399
Every single lion
has a name. A Maasai name.

10:58.400 --> 11:01.119
And when you see a lion,

11:01.120 --> 11:04.119
do you know how it's going
to behave?

11:04.120 --> 11:06.200
It depends on the lion.

11:08.640 --> 11:13.999
For a Maasai warrior,
lions are nothing to be scared of.

11:14.000 --> 11:18.559
But if I saw a lion, a lion
would be likely to attack me.

11:18.560 --> 11:20.440
Only if you threaten it.

11:20.441 --> 11:22.839
Mmm, well, I hope
the next lion knows that.

11:28.080 --> 11:31.639
Olubi killed his first lion
when he was just 17,

11:31.640 --> 11:34.000
after it attacked his cattle.

11:35.000 --> 11:38.879
Unfortunately, the lion
turned out to be pregnant.

11:38.880 --> 11:41.520
And that led to
a remarkable turnaround.

11:46.360 --> 11:50.039
The Maasai respect
all living things.

11:50.040 --> 11:53.560
And I began to feel guilty
about the lion that I had killed.

11:57.720 --> 12:00.600
In the end,
I came to admire the lions.

12:04.640 --> 12:07.760
Olubi had a dramatic
change of heart.

12:09.360 --> 12:12.800
He turned his back on hundreds
of years of Maasai tradition.

12:14.160 --> 12:18.360
Along with some other warriors,
Olubi became a lion guardian.

12:19.920 --> 12:23.840
Instead of hunting lions,
Olubi will be protecting them.

12:28.400 --> 12:30.759
He teamed up
with Stephanie Dolrenry,

12:30.760 --> 12:33.439
who helped pioneer the project.

12:35.120 --> 12:37.439
Just by respecting their traditions

12:37.440 --> 12:39.639
and also bringing in
their ecological knowledge,

12:39.640 --> 12:41.319
it's been hugely successful.

12:41.320 --> 12:43.919
They know their areas,
they know how to track lions,

12:43.920 --> 12:46.358
they've been doing it
for generation after generation.

12:46.359 --> 12:47.638
They know how to track them,

12:47.639 --> 12:50.120
they know how to hunt them,
they know how to find them.

12:53.440 --> 12:56.240
This is only a small-scale project.

12:57.680 --> 12:59.799
But with lion numbers
as low as they are,

12:59.800 --> 13:01.640
they need all the help they can get.

13:02.800 --> 13:05.879
Olubi is tracking
radio-collared lions.

13:05.880 --> 13:08.839
He's able to warn villages
to move their cattle

13:08.840 --> 13:10.480
when the pride is in the area.

13:11.640 --> 13:13.720
And so, they're avoiding conflict.

13:18.520 --> 13:20.959
No lions have been killed
in the immediate area

13:20.960 --> 13:22.759
since the project began.

13:22.760 --> 13:25.919
By combining the science,
both ancient and contemporary,

13:25.920 --> 13:29.479
they're beginning to make
a real difference.

13:29.480 --> 13:31.639
There's so much to be learned.

13:31.640 --> 13:36.199
I feel I bring in modern technology,
modern knowledge.

13:36.200 --> 13:39.239
And, in return, they teach us
about the environment

13:39.240 --> 13:41.959
and how things have changed
in their environment.

13:41.960 --> 13:44.959
And it's a really neat exchange.

13:44.960 --> 13:47.759
You can't say we're the biologists
or the teachers.

13:47.760 --> 13:50.479
Or the guardians or the teachers.

13:50.480 --> 13:52.479
We're both teachers
and we're both students

13:52.480 --> 13:55.680
and I think that's...
that blend is amazing.

13:57.240 --> 14:01.119
Critically, at the heart of this
project is a huge attitude change

14:01.120 --> 14:03.439
by these Maasai warriors.

14:03.440 --> 14:08.039
An animal that was once
their sworn enemy, they now protect.

14:08.040 --> 14:11.079
And their willingness to share
knowledge with other communities

14:11.080 --> 14:14.319
means that projects like this
could be repeated

14:14.320 --> 14:16.319
in other parts of Africa.

14:16.320 --> 14:19.519
Traditionally,
when a warrior killed a lion,

14:19.520 --> 14:21.959
<i>He</i> took the name of the lion.

14:21.960 --> 14:24.239
Now, it's the other way round.

14:24.240 --> 14:29.639
Now, the lion takes the name
of the warrior who protects it.

14:29.640 --> 14:32.119
The scheme is a huge success.

14:32.120 --> 14:37.399
There are about 100 lions involved
in the scheme in this neighbourhood.

14:37.400 --> 14:41.640
This is 21st-century conservation
in action.

14:51.440 --> 14:53.919
Perhaps the biggest threat
to wildlife

14:53.920 --> 14:56.039
is the competition for space

14:56.040 --> 14:58.560
with the rapidly-growing
human population.

15:06.120 --> 15:09.079
The Virunga volcanoes
straddle the borders

15:09.080 --> 15:12.680
of Rwanda, Uganda and
the Democratic Republic of Congo.

15:15.320 --> 15:18.079
The rich volcanic soils
are extremely fertile.

15:18.080 --> 15:21.760
It's one of the most intensively
cultivated areas in Africa.

15:26.480 --> 15:28.919
But the farmers also share
this region

15:28.920 --> 15:30.920
with one of our closest relatives.

15:31.920 --> 15:33.239
This is home

15:33.240 --> 15:38.400
to the last 800-or-so wild mountain
gorillas left on Earth.

15:40.560 --> 15:42.839
We know a great deal
about these animals,

15:42.840 --> 15:45.400
they've been closely studied
for 50 years.

15:48.120 --> 15:52.680
One strong silverback male
keeps everyone in order.

15:57.320 --> 16:00.880
And gorilla family life
is mostly peaceful.

16:02.720 --> 16:05.079
Until a few generations ago,

16:05.080 --> 16:08.639
mountain gorillas, hidden in
the seclusion of their forests

16:08.640 --> 16:11.159
were seldom seen by human beings.

16:11.160 --> 16:15.319
But their habitat was steadily
being carved away,

16:15.320 --> 16:18.879
and now these gorillas are
marooned on the volcanic slopes

16:18.880 --> 16:20.479
in a sea of farmland.

16:25.680 --> 16:30.079
The fact that gorillas now regularly
come into contact with people

16:30.080 --> 16:33.239
not only means an increased
threat of poaching,

16:33.240 --> 16:35.680
but also of disease.

16:36.960 --> 16:39.679
Gorillas have little
or no resistance

16:39.680 --> 16:41.520
to the bugs that we carry.

16:53.480 --> 16:57.599
Numbers here once dropped
to around 250.

16:57.600 --> 16:59.359
They were facing extinction.

17:00.840 --> 17:02.520
Action had to be taken.

17:06.480 --> 17:10.398
The boundaries of the National Park
were strictly enforced,

17:10.400 --> 17:13.598
halting the encroachment
of farmland.

17:13.599 --> 17:16.239
And it was decided
that the only solution

17:16.240 --> 17:19.720
was to intensively manage
the remaining gorillas.

17:22.280 --> 17:25.480
Teams of scientists
constantly monitor them.

17:28.119 --> 17:30.799
Their forests are patrolled
to cut poachers' snares.

17:32.960 --> 17:35.759
And vets watch their health closely.

17:35.760 --> 17:38.359
No, don't take it...

17:38.360 --> 17:41.279
This is funded mostly
through eco-tourism

17:41.280 --> 17:43.920
and donations from
all over the world.

17:47.000 --> 17:50.200
Mountain gorillas are now
back from the brink.

17:57.840 --> 18:01.679
This level of human intervention
might not be ideal,

18:01.680 --> 18:03.440
but it's working.

18:04.880 --> 18:08.599
Every year, there are
a few more mountain gorillas

18:08.600 --> 18:11.440
and, possibly,
just a little more optimism.

18:14.760 --> 18:17.719
Intensive management
within a protected area

18:17.720 --> 18:21.560
may represent the only future
for many African species.

18:25.120 --> 18:28.680
But for some animals,
that is simply not possible.

18:31.160 --> 18:34.559
What happens if the animal
you're trying to protect

18:34.560 --> 18:37.240
is not suited to park life?

18:45.480 --> 18:48.840
Elephants require vast amounts
of space to roam.

18:50.400 --> 18:54.240
They have a range of
up to 1,300 square miles.

18:56.000 --> 18:58.679
Given the chance, they will even
move between countries

18:58.680 --> 19:00.759
in search of the best food.

19:00.760 --> 19:03.520
Particularly, if conditions
get rough.

19:09.880 --> 19:14.920
This was the scene
in Amboseli National Park in 2009.

19:18.520 --> 19:22.439
The park is home
to nearly 1,500 elephants.

19:22.440 --> 19:26.560
And this was the worst drought
for half a century.

19:28.600 --> 19:34.320
60% of zebras and 95% of wildebeests
were wiped out.

19:37.440 --> 19:42.239
The seasonal rains had failed
for the last two years.

19:42.240 --> 19:45.120
And the elephants that lived here
were slowly starving.

19:46.360 --> 19:50.560
The park created to protect them
is now surrounded by farmland.

19:51.880 --> 19:55.000
The elephants had little choice
of where else to go.

19:59.360 --> 20:03.359
Caught up in this catastrophe,
were three sisters.

20:03.360 --> 20:06.720
They are the front line for elephant
protection in the park.

20:08.320 --> 20:10.760
And they know these animals
better than anyone else.

20:12.320 --> 20:16.479
Nora Njiraini
and Katito and Soila Sayialel.

20:16.480 --> 20:19.439
You know, all the elephants
have been given names.

20:19.440 --> 20:21.279
They are family to us.

20:21.280 --> 20:22.880
Hello, Anastasia!

20:25.840 --> 20:29.839
The sisters have been following
these elephants for over 25 years,

20:29.840 --> 20:31.639
trying to ensure their safety,

20:31.640 --> 20:35.879
particularly at times when life
is tough for these animals.

20:35.880 --> 20:38.439
It really was terrible.

20:38.440 --> 20:40.919
There was nothing actually
to feed on.

20:40.920 --> 20:44.599
I even went and asked
the old Maasai men

20:44.600 --> 20:47.319
whether they have ever experienced
such a drought.

20:47.320 --> 20:52.080
The only time it was close
to what it was then, was in 1961.

20:53.880 --> 20:55.400
In 2009...

20:56.800 --> 20:58.879
we lost quite a number
of elephants.

20:58.880 --> 21:02.039
I think we lost about 400 elephants.

21:02.040 --> 21:04.720
And it started with the young ones.

21:10.680 --> 21:12.599
Elephants usually escape drought

21:12.600 --> 21:16.399
by moving into other
less affected areas.

21:16.400 --> 21:21.119
But Africa's human population is
growing at double the global rate.

21:21.120 --> 21:24.199
And traditional migration routes
have been cut

21:24.200 --> 21:28.799
by the development of towns,
cities, farmland and roads,

21:28.800 --> 21:30.880
leaving these elephants stuck.

21:35.080 --> 21:37.080
This young calf is starving...

21:38.400 --> 21:41.200
and there is nothing
they can do to help.

22:00.600 --> 22:03.919
For the sisters,
who know each elephant personally,

22:03.920 --> 22:06.000
this is a terrible moment.

22:07.640 --> 22:10.040
It is something that we feel
in our hearts.

22:11.280 --> 22:14.159
You can imagine the kind of feelings
that we get.

22:14.160 --> 22:15.719
You know, knowing those elephants

22:15.720 --> 22:19.440
and seeing something like that
happen. It really touches us.

22:21.200 --> 22:25.719
It was a tough year for all
the young elephants in the region.

22:25.720 --> 22:28.599
We lost all the calves
that were born that year.

22:28.600 --> 22:30.440
All of them, we lost them.

22:37.320 --> 22:40.480
There was nothing the sisters
could do to save the baby.

22:43.320 --> 22:46.399
But they were determined to save
any elephants they could,

22:46.400 --> 22:49.440
especially mothers
who could breed again.

22:55.200 --> 22:57.679
They found this female
stuck in the mud,

22:57.680 --> 23:00.120
exhausted in a dried-up lake bed.

23:07.960 --> 23:11.640
The elephant that got stuck
in the mud was Kolida.

23:14.120 --> 23:15.999
Poor thing, you know.

23:16.000 --> 23:18.240
She was there
for quite a long time.

23:20.600 --> 23:23.799
A Maasai reported it to us

23:23.800 --> 23:27.960
and we had to combine efforts with
the Kenya Wildlife Services people.

23:35.600 --> 23:37.839
Weighing about three tonnes,

23:37.840 --> 23:40.879
Kolida is just too heavy
to shift by hand.

23:40.880 --> 23:42.760
She is weakening fast.

23:46.040 --> 23:49.600
So the next morning,
heavy machinery is brought in.

24:21.480 --> 24:25.439
After two days stuck in the mud,
Kolida is exhausted,

24:25.440 --> 24:27.400
but she's up on her feet again.

24:45.200 --> 24:48.239
The rains did return to Amboseli.

24:48.240 --> 24:52.119
And thanks in part to the work
of those dedicated three women,

24:52.120 --> 24:55.520
elephant numbers are now
beginning to rise again.

24:58.800 --> 25:02.760
There's no doubt that this was
an extremely severe event.

25:04.200 --> 25:08.280
But is it an isolated incident
or a developing pattern?

25:09.960 --> 25:11.839
They say that with global warming,

25:11.840 --> 25:14.279
we actually don't know
what's going to happen.

25:14.280 --> 25:18.440
But we just have to cross fingers
and hope for a better future.

25:22.160 --> 25:24.159
Given the opportunity,

25:24.160 --> 25:27.439
the numbers of elephants
in East Africa will recover.

25:27.440 --> 25:30.079
Especially, if they're given
the freedom to range widely

25:30.080 --> 25:32.880
and so avoid the harshest
conditions.

25:35.360 --> 25:38.359
One solution to help elephants
find the space they need

25:38.360 --> 25:40.199
is to link parks together

25:40.200 --> 25:43.040
and provide safe routes
between them.

25:44.640 --> 25:47.399
Elephants are great travellers

25:47.400 --> 25:49.199
and here, in this part of Kenya,

25:49.200 --> 25:51.839
they regularly moved
from the lowlands

25:51.840 --> 25:55.639
up the side of the mountains
to feed in the forests up there.

25:55.640 --> 25:58.599
But then, the human population
of Kenya grew

25:58.600 --> 26:02.159
and roads like this one
were constructed,

26:02.160 --> 26:05.559
penning the elephants
down in the lowland,

26:05.560 --> 26:08.839
where they created havoc
amongst the farms.

26:08.840 --> 26:13.239
Not only that, there were danger
of collisions on the road.

26:13.240 --> 26:17.159
And then someone suggested
building an underpass.

26:17.160 --> 26:20.559
Within 24 hours of it
being completed,

26:20.560 --> 26:22.679
one elephant had passed through.

26:22.680 --> 26:25.879
And now, all the elephants
use that route

26:25.880 --> 26:28.800
to go up the mountain,
often at night, to feed.

26:36.360 --> 26:41.119
Simple ideas like this underpass
are a lifeline for these elephants,

26:41.120 --> 26:43.560
especially in times of drought.

26:47.920 --> 26:50.759
Africa's climate
is certainly changing.

26:50.760 --> 26:55.279
Some parts of the continent have
become 3.5 degrees centigrade hotter

26:55.280 --> 26:57.080
in the past 20 years.

26:59.520 --> 27:03.279
At the summit of Africa's most
famous mountain, Kilimanjaro,

27:03.280 --> 27:06.520
80% of its permanent ice fields
have disappeared.

27:10.800 --> 27:13.840
Soon, it will be
free of ice altogether.

27:16.520 --> 27:19.679
All over Africa,
the mountainous regions are often

27:19.680 --> 27:22.240
the first indicators
of climate change.

27:31.600 --> 27:36.760
Here, in the Ethiopian Highlands
live very unusual-looking creatures.

27:41.760 --> 27:43.640
Gelada baboons.

27:46.880 --> 27:49.000
Climate change refugees.

27:51.080 --> 27:54.119
Although this region of Ethiopia
lies in the tropics,

27:54.120 --> 27:57.720
up at 4,000 metres,
it doesn't feel like it.

27:59.320 --> 28:01.719
Unlike most African animals,

28:01.720 --> 28:04.920
geladas are adapted
to life in the cold.

28:08.120 --> 28:11.719
They used to be one of Africa's
most successful primates,

28:11.720 --> 28:13.999
found all over the continent.

28:14.000 --> 28:17.200
At one stage,
there were six different species.

28:18.600 --> 28:21.080
Now, there is only one.

28:26.320 --> 28:27.760
With the warming climate,

28:27.761 --> 28:30.359
their grazing is becoming
more and more scarce,

28:30.360 --> 28:33.040
restricted to cooler
and higher places.

28:43.440 --> 28:47.200
These geladas are being forced
higher into the mountains.

28:49.120 --> 28:52.320
Soon, there will be
nowhere left to go.

28:54.880 --> 28:58.120
This is a species
living on the edge.

28:59.680 --> 29:02.479
Even though they're isolated
on the mountain tops,

29:02.480 --> 29:05.199
they're not immune to our influence.

29:05.200 --> 29:07.319
As a result of changing climate,

29:07.320 --> 29:11.000
these gelada baboons may soon
be gone from our planet.

29:20.280 --> 29:23.480
Africa is the world's
hottest continent.

29:25.400 --> 29:27.800
And there is no doubt
it's getting warmer.

29:30.640 --> 29:34.999
The Sahara is the largest
hot desert in the world.

29:35.000 --> 29:38.280
Very little can survive
in these harsh conditions.

29:48.640 --> 29:50.679
Along the desert edge,

29:50.680 --> 29:55.759
life clings on in the face
of encroaching sands.

29:55.760 --> 29:57.720
But for how long?

29:59.520 --> 30:01.559
Alongside the wildlife,

30:01.560 --> 30:05.800
22 million people struggle to make
a living on these desert margins.

30:08.840 --> 30:13.200
Can anything be done to stop the
sand overwhelming this fragile land?

30:14.760 --> 30:20.439
One idea is to build a green wall
of trees across 11 countries.

30:20.440 --> 30:23.999
The project has already started
in Senegal.

30:24.000 --> 30:27.720
But like all big ideas,
it has big problems.

30:30.240 --> 30:33.159
Getting 11 countries
to work together is not easy

30:33.160 --> 30:36.519
and simply irrigating a 5,000-mile
long belt of trees

30:36.520 --> 30:39.200
is an ambitious task.

30:44.560 --> 30:48.239
But all over Africa, people are
recognising how important it is

30:48.240 --> 30:51.280
to have trees as part
of their local landscape.

30:53.760 --> 30:58.600
This group of volunteers has planted
nearly 100 million saplings.

31:00.560 --> 31:03.839
They are just one of countless
similar groups and individuals

31:03.840 --> 31:07.439
taking it upon themselves
to reforest their own part

31:07.440 --> 31:09.200
of this great continent.

31:13.680 --> 31:17.439
Trees are essential for the future
of the continent and indeed,

31:17.440 --> 31:19.120
to the rest of the planet.

31:25.080 --> 31:27.920
This is the Congo Basin.

31:31.040 --> 31:34.999
It's one of the most biologically
important forests on Earth

31:35.000 --> 31:37.839
and it's not just because
of the concentration

31:37.840 --> 31:40.120
of plants and animals
that live here.

31:41.920 --> 31:44.679
It's because it's also
one of the powerhouses

31:44.680 --> 31:46.840
behind the planet's wind and rain.

31:51.160 --> 31:54.519
Each hectare of trees
releases, as vapour,

31:54.520 --> 31:58.360
almost 190,000 litres
of water a year.

32:00.520 --> 32:03.999
This water passes into
the atmosphere to be transported

32:04.000 --> 32:05.600
around the entire globe.

32:09.280 --> 32:13.960
That means the heart of the world's
weather lies in tropical forests.

32:20.800 --> 32:23.399
Unfortunately, there's an almost
insatiable demand

32:23.400 --> 32:27.719
in Europe and China for hardwood
from these very forests.

32:27.720 --> 32:31.160
And that is having
an enormous impact.

32:33.280 --> 32:37.719
As more tropical forest is felled,
some scientists are seeing

32:37.720 --> 32:43.479
a correlation with changing storm
patterns across Europe and America.

32:43.480 --> 32:46.559
And it's likely to become
more extreme.

32:46.560 --> 32:49.799
Staggeringly,
50% of the Congo Basin forest

32:49.800 --> 32:52.240
has been allocated for logging.

32:54.200 --> 32:58.480
The future of Africa's forest has
never been more critical for us all.

33:03.120 --> 33:06.960
But the consequences of global
warming aren't limited to the land.

33:11.680 --> 33:15.000
Africa is almost completely
surrounded by oceans.

33:21.240 --> 33:23.600
Here on the east coast,
there are animals feeling

33:23.601 --> 33:27.120
the changing climate
in a most surprising way.

33:33.760 --> 33:37.639
This is a young female green turtle.

33:37.640 --> 33:40.879
During her lifetime,
she will travel thousands of miles

33:40.880 --> 33:43.120
through the ocean looking for food.

33:44.720 --> 33:47.719
Turtles return to the same beach
from which they hatched

33:47.720 --> 33:49.600
to lay their own eggs.

33:50.760 --> 33:52.439
The eggs are buried in the sand

33:52.440 --> 33:55.520
and the hatchlings will emerge
after about two months.

33:56.960 --> 34:00.879
But there's a strange thing
about turtle eggs.

34:00.880 --> 34:05.159
And that is the temperature
at which the eggs are kept

34:05.160 --> 34:09.079
will determine the sex
of most of the hatchlings.

34:09.080 --> 34:12.438
If the sand temperature is high,
they will be female,

34:12.440 --> 34:15.520
if it's low, they will be male.

34:16.920 --> 34:22.399
Global warming could have a crucial
effect on turtle populations.

34:22.400 --> 34:27.679
And this young female may find it
very difficult in years to come

34:27.679 --> 34:30.480
to find a male with which to mate.

34:40.360 --> 34:43.478
But a local conservation group
recognised that the odds

34:43.480 --> 34:46.360
are stacking up
against these little turtles.

34:50.880 --> 34:53.559
There's not much they can do
about climate change,

34:53.560 --> 34:56.199
but they have got together
with the local fishermen

34:56.199 --> 35:00.119
to try and improve
the turtles' chances of survival.

35:00.120 --> 35:02.359
Every turtle counts.

35:02.360 --> 35:06.599
So, each time one is found injured
or accidentally caught in the nets,

35:06.600 --> 35:10.199
it's brought to Kahindi Changawa
and his team.

35:10.200 --> 35:13.199
So we began with only 16 fishermen

35:13.200 --> 35:15.919
altogether in 1998.

35:15.920 --> 35:19.160
Now we have hundreds of fishermen
working with us.

35:22.360 --> 35:27.799
Grazing by turtles is essential for
the health of the beds of seagrass

35:27.800 --> 35:31.079
and these are the home
of shrimps and lobsters

35:31.080 --> 35:33.480
and that, of course,
helps fishermen too.

35:35.160 --> 35:37.879
The project has
a turtle rehabilitation centre

35:37.880 --> 35:41.640
and for the last two years,
it's become home to Shella.

35:44.600 --> 35:49.399
She had an accident with a boat.
It was a hit from behind.

35:49.400 --> 35:53.679
She lost three ribs
and her spine was as well damaged.

35:53.680 --> 35:56.720
It's now in the process
of healing back together.

36:00.160 --> 36:03.199
Shella's injuries
have affected her buoyancy.

36:03.200 --> 36:05.359
She's healed well
and to encourage her

36:05.360 --> 36:08.479
to exercise her flippers properly,
she has, every day,

36:08.480 --> 36:10.360
a little trip to the seaside.

36:15.360 --> 36:19.839
We usually take Shella for
a sea bath on a daily basis,

36:19.840 --> 36:22.559
and the reason for doing that

36:22.560 --> 36:25.600
is to give her enough room
to get exercises.

36:30.800 --> 36:34.079
She gets an opportunity
to eat her natural food.

36:34.080 --> 36:38.399
We believe it keeps her fit
and the other thing is,

36:38.400 --> 36:41.440
she gets to use her rear flippers
quite often.

36:45.440 --> 36:49.080
For Kahindi, it's one of the rewards
for all his hard work.

36:50.160 --> 36:55.559
It's really enjoyable. Very few
people have the privilege like I do

36:55.560 --> 36:58.960
of swimming with the turtles
and having that fun.

37:01.680 --> 37:04.600
I do enjoy what I'm doing.

37:15.760 --> 37:20.039
Shella certainly did get stronger,
but the hope that some day

37:20.040 --> 37:24.039
she might swim out in the open
was not to be fulfilled.

37:24.040 --> 37:28.360
Unaccountably, she become weaker
and eventually died.

37:33.520 --> 37:37.679
This kind of work will
inevitably have setbacks.

37:37.680 --> 37:40.320
But there are always new turtles
to be cared for.

37:41.720 --> 37:45.679
- Is she healthy?
- Yeah, this one is healthy.

37:45.680 --> 37:49.200
She has a few bruises,
could be from the fishing gear.

37:50.520 --> 37:52.039
Like these ones here.

37:52.040 --> 37:57.079
- Oh, yeah, but otherwise healthy.
- Otherwise the turtle's healthy.

37:57.080 --> 37:59.440
Shall we have a go?

38:01.920 --> 38:09.239
Since 1998 till now,
we've released over 8,200 turtles.

38:09.240 --> 38:13.879
It makes me feel proud and
privileged, we've done lots of work

38:13.880 --> 38:19.799
with the community and changing
the attitudes and their behaviours.

38:19.800 --> 38:24.040
I guess our job as an organisation
was really successful.

38:28.160 --> 38:33.319
A young turtle like that
could lay 6,000-7,000 eggs

38:33.320 --> 38:34.999
in her lifetime.

38:35.000 --> 38:40.000
So, the survival of just one
could have huge consequences.

38:42.480 --> 38:46.119
Saving just one individual
requires huge effort

38:46.120 --> 38:49.399
and of course, saving a species
requires even more.

38:49.400 --> 38:54.080
But these heroic efforts are only
ever going to be a partial solution.

38:58.400 --> 39:02.079
Every individual animal is part
of a much bigger story,

39:02.080 --> 39:05.119
part of an interconnected web
of plants, animals

39:05.120 --> 39:09.240
and the landscape itself
that make up an entire ecosystem.

39:13.200 --> 39:18.000
Saving ecosystems is the key
to Africa's wild future.

39:19.320 --> 39:23.360
Gorongosa in Mozambique
is a modern day Jurassic Park.

39:29.160 --> 39:32.360
It's ruled by some of the world's
biggest crocodiles.

39:37.440 --> 39:40.599
Some of these monsters
are six metres long

39:40.600 --> 39:42.520
and close to 50 years old.

39:47.000 --> 39:51.799
Somehow they managed to escape
a civil war lasting nearly 20 years,

39:51.800 --> 39:54.160
which swept through Gorongosa.

39:55.520 --> 39:59.120
95% of all the other
large animals were wiped out.

40:01.840 --> 40:05.200
But 50 years ago,
the scene was very different.

40:07.280 --> 40:09.919
This was a thriving
tourist attraction.

40:09.920 --> 40:14.839
A wild paradise. Visitors flocked
from around the world,

40:14.840 --> 40:18.320
drawn by the vast range
and abundance of the wildlife.

40:22.080 --> 40:25.759
The most popular spot for tourists
was an old restaurant,

40:25.760 --> 40:28.800
a look-out post for the local lions.

40:36.920 --> 40:39.479
The restaurant has long gone.

40:39.480 --> 40:41.560
Along with the lions.

40:43.000 --> 40:47.959
Gorongosa looked empty
and beyond rescue.

40:47.960 --> 40:50.359
But not to everyone.

40:50.360 --> 40:54.239
A brave and ambitious project began
to try and restore the park

40:54.240 --> 40:57.159
to its former richness
and splendour.

40:57.160 --> 41:01.159
The first stage is to find out
which animals as well as crocodiles

41:01.160 --> 41:03.119
are still here.

41:03.120 --> 41:05.119
So the team is mapping and counting

41:05.120 --> 41:07.680
all the big animals they see
in the park.

41:30.000 --> 41:33.039
But it soon became clear
that these big animals

41:33.040 --> 41:35.240
were only part of the story.

41:36.600 --> 41:40.720
Perhaps even more important might be
the little ones hidden underfoot.

41:42.400 --> 41:45.799
It's understanding these creatures
that is attracting

41:45.800 --> 41:48.480
some of the best minds
in the scientific world.

41:50.120 --> 41:54.079
- You were going to show me something?
- Yep, something new.

41:54.080 --> 41:58.719
Professor Ed Wilson is
a world expert on biodiversity

41:58.720 --> 42:03.199
and at a mere 83, he's still
pursuing his passion... ants.

42:03.200 --> 42:09.559
- You see there's a big nest...
- Wow. Let me just get one specimen.

42:09.560 --> 42:14.519
If you look down at your feet,
you may see them.

42:14.520 --> 42:18.319
Walking by here and there,
an ant, a little beetle...

42:18.320 --> 42:22.480
They're what I like to call
the little things that run the Earth.

42:26.720 --> 42:29.759
It's the rich diversity
of insect life here

42:29.760 --> 42:33.280
that gives Gorongosa
the prospect of a future.

42:34.280 --> 42:37.280
These creatures form
the basis of life in the park.

42:40.720 --> 42:44.559
This is so much fun.
These little invertebrate creatures.

42:44.560 --> 42:48.679
The creatures that do most
of the work, turn most of the energy,

42:48.680 --> 42:51.199
save most of the material

42:51.200 --> 42:56.519
and allow us to reinsert big animals
with some confidence.

42:56.520 --> 43:00.719
- Have you got it in the vial yet? Oh, good.
- Yeah. I've got three of them.

43:00.720 --> 43:03.359
Professor Wilson was one
of the first scientists

43:03.360 --> 43:05.199
to explore this area

43:05.200 --> 43:08.720
together with local wildlife
biologist Tonga Tortuda.

43:10.840 --> 43:12.639
If you could gather them all up,

43:12.640 --> 43:16.919
all these little invertebrate
creatures, and weigh them,

43:16.920 --> 43:23.039
they would weigh far more than
all of the big animals put together,

43:23.040 --> 43:25.719
even in a fully restored park.

43:25.720 --> 43:30.159
It's these little creatures,
together with the plants and trees,

43:30.160 --> 43:33.279
that still make this place
a viable option

43:33.280 --> 43:35.679
for reintroducing bigger animals.

43:35.680 --> 43:37.839
I can't be sure that's a new species,

43:37.840 --> 43:40.519
but this is the kind of thing
that might be.

43:40.520 --> 43:45.840
This park came that close
to vanishing...

43:47.920 --> 43:51.439
and I'm happy to report
it is coming back.

43:51.440 --> 43:54.199
And this is one of the great stories.

43:54.200 --> 43:56.919
It's inspirational, I think.

43:56.920 --> 44:01.119
It's a fine, shining example of
what to do with all our parks,

44:01.120 --> 44:05.239
even those that have been damaged
by human activity.

44:05.240 --> 44:08.639
But there's another reason
why Gorongosa is important

44:08.640 --> 44:11.920
for the future of Africa
and perhaps for us all.

44:13.280 --> 44:18.559
It is here, in this park, that people
come to see, not just the big animals

44:18.560 --> 44:23.759
that thrill us, but they will see
Earth as it looked and felt

44:23.760 --> 44:26.320
before the coming of humanity.

44:29.880 --> 44:32.079
Saving big animals is important,

44:32.080 --> 44:34.439
but to do that
with any real success,

44:34.440 --> 44:37.759
we have to start understanding
and preserving the plants

44:37.760 --> 44:40.680
and insects that support
an ecosystem.

44:42.360 --> 44:46.799
It's this that will allow
the larger animals to thrive.

44:46.800 --> 44:50.839
Gorongosa is a real success story.

44:50.840 --> 44:54.799
The government and the management
team have pledged themselves

44:54.800 --> 44:59.239
to a plan to restore the land
to what it was.

44:59.240 --> 45:03.399
While it can never be exactly
the same as it was before the war,

45:03.400 --> 45:07.720
it can still become
a rich and thriving ecosystem.

45:21.360 --> 45:25.480
The scale of the challenge
across Africa is enormous.

45:29.800 --> 45:32.920
After all, it's a huge continent.

45:35.480 --> 45:37.759
The United Kingdom, China,

45:37.760 --> 45:40.719
the United States of America, India,

45:40.720 --> 45:43.759
Japan and most of the rest of Europe

45:43.760 --> 45:46.760
would all fit within its borders.

45:49.320 --> 45:55.160
Africa still retains 45% of
the Earth's uncultivated land.

45:56.600 --> 46:00.359
It's still the greatest
wilderness on Earth

46:00.360 --> 46:03.280
and that is why it's important.

46:05.600 --> 46:09.039
Human beings have lived
alongside wildlife here

46:09.040 --> 46:11.719
longer than anywhere else.

46:11.720 --> 46:16.440
But now in the 21st century, animal
numbers are at a critical level.

46:18.480 --> 46:21.759
Like it or not,
this generation is responsible

46:21.760 --> 46:25.120
for handing on
the world's wildlife to the next.

46:27.320 --> 46:31.399
That means taking care of the
animals and lands where they live,

46:31.400 --> 46:35.000
so there is still space
for us all to coexist.

46:38.440 --> 46:45.239
Nobody knows what the future
has in store for this little calf.

46:45.240 --> 46:49.519
Or indeed, how the changes that
inevitably are going to take place

46:49.520 --> 46:55.199
in Africa will affect the rest
of the world and this little animal.

46:55.200 --> 46:57.719
But one thing is certain.

46:57.720 --> 47:03.279
What happens here is more important
than it has ever been

47:03.280 --> 47:06.679
and that the relationship
of the rest of the world

47:06.680 --> 47:10.559
to this great continent
and the creatures that live in it

47:10.560 --> 47:13.760
is more important than ever before.

47:24.600 --> 47:30.599
On whichever part of the planet
we live, we all have a part to play

47:30.600 --> 47:35.320
in what sort of future
this wild continent has.

47:59.200 --> 48:01.959
Africa, the final shoot.

48:01.960 --> 48:06.279
It's one of our most ambitious trips
with lots of locations to visit

48:06.280 --> 48:10.879
- and many technical hurdles
to overcome. - Five, take one.

48:10.880 --> 48:14.560
To the west are vast rainforests
the size of India.

48:17.720 --> 48:21.959
Helicopters enable us to go
to extraordinary landscapes...

48:21.960 --> 48:24.319
We're heading off to do
the very first visit,

48:24.320 --> 48:27.519
the opening of the whole
Africa series with David.

48:27.520 --> 48:30.799
How do you like the view
from my office?

48:32.400 --> 48:34.719
And attempt air-to-air filming.

48:34.720 --> 48:36.319
Stand by, David, and action!

48:36.320 --> 48:41.320
I'm flying over the
Great Rift Valley in East Africa.

48:56.760 --> 48:59.839
But perhaps the most ambitious
task for this shoot

48:59.840 --> 49:02.200
is the filming
with black rhinoceros.

49:03.560 --> 49:07.639
They have a reputation for being
aggressive and with poor eyesight,

49:07.640 --> 49:12.319
they're likely to charge objects
or people they don't recognise.

49:18.040 --> 49:21.719
But the plight of the rhino
is such an important story

49:21.720 --> 49:24.599
that we want to get as close
to them as possible.

49:24.600 --> 49:28.120
We also want to meet the people
who are working to protect them.

49:30.960 --> 49:36.079
So our team have come to assess
the viability of filming up close

49:36.080 --> 49:40.599
with a rhino called Elvis
who's been reared by humans.

49:40.600 --> 49:43.959
He should be safer than a wild
rhino, but there's still a risk

49:43.960 --> 49:46.600
he could be unpredictable
with strangers.

49:48.280 --> 49:52.519
Wildlife ranger, Tonga Kaseyo
has brought up Elvis by hand

49:52.520 --> 49:57.119
and knows that tickling him gently
with a stick keeps him calm.

49:57.120 --> 50:00.479
But if anything were to go
seriously wrong,

50:00.480 --> 50:03.199
there would be little he could do
against a one-tonne Elvis.

50:03.200 --> 50:07.199
And this fact hasn't escaped
cameraman Mike Fox.

50:07.200 --> 50:11.479
He knows we're here.
We're here on his terms.

50:11.480 --> 50:15.679
If he decided to bat us all
into the next world...

50:15.680 --> 50:17.640
he would do.

50:19.400 --> 50:22.479
Director Kate Broome
checks with Tonga that it's safe

50:22.480 --> 50:24.480
for the crew to get closer.

50:26.400 --> 50:29.159
Normally, we have to stay
in the Land Rovers.

50:29.160 --> 50:31.280
They're saying it's okay to go in.

50:33.000 --> 50:36.039
This is such
an extraordinary opportunity,

50:36.040 --> 50:38.199
to be this close to...

50:38.200 --> 50:40.040
a black rhino.

50:41.760 --> 50:46.640
The trial goes well with Elvis and
the stage is set for future filming.

50:49.280 --> 50:53.040
Several weeks later, the team are
back and this time I've joined them.

50:54.040 --> 50:58.240
But Elvis's mood has changed.
He seems more wilful.

51:00.080 --> 51:03.159
Now, I've stood by many
wild animals in my time,

51:03.160 --> 51:06.040
but I'm not as fast on my pins
as I used to be.

51:08.920 --> 51:10.999
We don't want to test
Elvis's patience,

51:11.000 --> 51:13.359
so we get on with filming.

51:13.360 --> 51:16.960
A horn that is worth
its weight in gold.

51:22.360 --> 51:24.320
And one way...

51:25.360 --> 51:26.760
of protecting him...

51:28.600 --> 51:30.999
would be...

51:31.000 --> 51:33.640
to cut that horn off the nose.

51:39.680 --> 51:42.799
- How is it?
- It looks great.

51:42.800 --> 51:45.239
The team check that they have
what they need

51:45.240 --> 51:48.039
and Elvis lets us know
that he's had enough.

51:48.040 --> 51:53.639
- Just watch out, everybody. Yeah.
- I'll get out of the way.

51:53.640 --> 51:56.439
But actually, it's a positive sign

51:56.440 --> 51:59.279
that Elvis is not
as friendly this time.

51:59.280 --> 52:03.079
Tonga and his colleagues want Elvis
to live more like a wild rhino

52:03.080 --> 52:05.439
and develop a wariness of humans

52:05.440 --> 52:08.800
that may offer him
some protection from poachers.

52:10.880 --> 52:12.760
Good luck to you, Elvis.

52:17.520 --> 52:21.279
Whilst filming, we're lucky enough
to have a very well equipped camp.

52:21.280 --> 52:24.560
It's in the bush and there's
no escaping the wild animals.

52:29.760 --> 52:32.959
One of the great,
wonderful things about

52:32.960 --> 52:36.399
camping out in the middle
of the open is the animals.

52:36.400 --> 52:41.319
But it can also be one of
the dangerous/annoying things.

52:41.320 --> 52:42.520
Absolutely.

52:46.000 --> 52:48.239
In the annoying category,

52:48.240 --> 52:50.080
vervet monkeys.

52:53.120 --> 52:56.479
Vervet monkeys have stolen
my Ferrero Rocher

52:56.480 --> 53:00.199
and one of my glow sticks
from our medical supplies.

53:00.200 --> 53:03.519
So, if we see a luminous-faced
monkey in the night,

53:03.520 --> 53:06.319
I'll identify the naughty one
that's been stealing our stuff.

53:06.320 --> 53:09.039
And they leave little presents for us

53:09.040 --> 53:11.520
when they've been in,
just as a calling card.

53:15.760 --> 53:20.959
But camp manager Andres
finds more worrying animal signs.

53:20.960 --> 53:25.320
Well, the lions were quite close,
just behind the tents.

53:26.520 --> 53:29.439
Some must have come in

53:29.440 --> 53:31.799
and I don't know...

53:31.800 --> 53:34.439
You can see a few scratches.

53:34.440 --> 53:40.960
I think maybe he was wanting
to look at himself in the mirror.

53:42.400 --> 53:44.839
Lions in camp are worrying enough,

53:44.840 --> 53:47.039
but there I was
reading my book when...

53:47.040 --> 53:49.759
- Uh-oh.
- Whoa!

53:49.760 --> 53:51.640
..a Cape buffalo arrives.

53:53.520 --> 53:57.600
The most grumpy and dangerous
of the big five African animals.

53:59.840 --> 54:02.680
Mike! Stay in your tent.

54:04.440 --> 54:06.520
Shall we get David
to get in the tent?

54:24.000 --> 54:27.879
Buffalo usually move in herds,
so there's something odd about him.

54:27.880 --> 54:31.799
It may be that it was brought up
as a calf and is humanised.

54:31.800 --> 54:35.159
Or it may be that he's an outcast
from the herd in some way

54:35.160 --> 54:37.879
and that he's rather grumpy
and fed up with life.

54:37.880 --> 54:40.759
But I think it's just hot
and he's just plodding around

54:40.760 --> 54:44.759
and wondering where he might get
a drink and a decent sandwich.

54:44.760 --> 54:47.320
I feel the same way myself,
actually.

54:50.360 --> 54:55.399
The team's filming has coincided
with the newest arrival at Lewa,

54:55.400 --> 54:58.920
a baby rhino
in need of 24-hour care.

55:00.520 --> 55:03.439
This little chap was born blind

55:03.440 --> 55:05.760
and is guided everywhere
by his keepers.

55:06.920 --> 55:10.639
They took him away
from his mother a few weeks ago,

55:10.640 --> 55:13.959
because she couldn't
protect him any more.

55:13.960 --> 55:17.600
He's very vulnerable so he would
have been killed by predators.

55:20.200 --> 55:22.999
It's like filling up a petrol tank.

55:23.000 --> 55:24.919
Every rhino is precious

55:24.920 --> 55:29.040
and so it seems a fitting end
for the final scene of the series.

55:30.320 --> 55:36.999
No-one knows what the future holds
for this little creature,

55:37.000 --> 55:41.399
nor indeed what changes
will take place

55:41.400 --> 55:45.200
on the great continent
on which he lives.

56:01.120 --> 56:03.279
David, I found that...

56:03.280 --> 56:06.999
- Oh, gosh. There's ants... everywhere.
- That's what it is.

56:07.000 --> 56:09.920
Yeah, hang on. Ants. Ant attack!

56:11.440 --> 56:15.639
I just found that
extraordinarily moving, actually.

56:15.640 --> 56:18.399
- What I said was all right? Are you sure?
- Yes.

56:18.400 --> 56:22.880
And how you did it,
it made me cry, I'm afraid, so...

56:23.960 --> 56:26.160
David Attenborough's made me cry.

56:28.320 --> 56:33.080
But just as we think we're
finishing, someone won't let us go.

56:35.880 --> 56:37.480
Hello, little fellow.

56:38.840 --> 56:43.839
He starts to squeak and we're able
to have a little chat.

56:43.840 --> 56:46.519
Oh!

56:46.520 --> 56:49.319
Oh!

56:49.320 --> 56:51.719
Oh!

56:51.720 --> 56:53.679
Oh.

56:53.680 --> 56:56.679
Oh. Mm.

56:56.680 --> 56:59.439
Oh!

56:59.440 --> 57:02.559
Think about it,
he's got a black world, hasn't he?

57:02.560 --> 57:06.319
And he's got smell
and he's got sound, so...

57:06.320 --> 57:11.239
he's more likely to be responding to
sound if he hasn't got the vision.

57:11.240 --> 57:13.799
He's just inquisitive, I suppose.

57:13.800 --> 57:15.080
Are you coming back?

57:18.360 --> 57:19.759
Oh!

57:23.440 --> 57:27.039
There is hope
for this little fellow.

57:27.040 --> 57:30.639
He's due to have an operation
on his eyes which may mean

57:30.640 --> 57:35.119
that as an adult
he can be returned to the wild

57:35.120 --> 57:37.000
just like Elvis.

57:38.520 --> 57:41.599
I do hope he gets
a cataract operation.

57:41.600 --> 57:43.280
It would be marvellous if he did.

57:45.000 --> 57:46.880
Enchanting creature.

57:56.774 --> 57:59.516

my earlier encounters,
