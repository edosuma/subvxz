ADDISON. ADDISON.

THE C.V.S. RESULTS,

04:59.750 --> 05:02.458

FOR THE BETA THALASSEMIA TRAIT.

05:02.500 --> 05:05.458
THAT'S JUST A MARKER.
YEAH, I KNOW,
BUT AMELIA ISN'T A CARRIER.

05:05.500 --> 05:07.667
AND NEITHER WAS HER HUSBAND.
WE SCREENED.

05:07.709 --> 05:10.041
AND--AND SO I-I CHECKED
THE I.V.F. RECORDS

05:10.083 --> 05:12.041
TO SEE WHO ELSE
I IMPLANTED THAT DAY.

05:12.083 --> 05:14.667

FOR BETA THALASSEMIA.

05:18.083 --> 05:20.709

05:20.750 --> 05:22.709
HOW?
I DON'T KNOW.

05:22.750 --> 05:24.709
HOW?!
I DON'T KNOW HOW.
I DON'T KNOW.

05:24.750 --> 05:26.709

IS INSIDE OF ZOE,

05:26.750 --> 05:29.375

IS INSIDE OF AMELIA.

EACH OTHER'S BABY.

WHY ASSUME IT WAS MY FAULT?
YOU'RE THE ONE
WHO DELIVERS THE SYRINGES

05:43.125 --> 05:47.291

YOU'VE BEEN WALKING AROUND HERE
UNFOCUSED, NOT GIVING A DAMN.

05:47.333 --> 05:50.041
THERE ARE STEPS TO THE PROCESS,
OKAY? MULTIPLE STEPS.

05:50.083 --> 05:52.583

NAOMI INJECTS THEM.
OH--

05:52.625 --> 05:55.542

I'M NOT SAYING IT WAS YOU.

05:55.583 --> 05:57.917

WE DON'T KNOW.

06:00.625 --> 06:04.041
(Naomi) HEY, HE'S RIGHT.
I AM THE DOCTOR.

06:04.083 --> 06:06.041
ULTIMATELY,
THIS IS MY RESPONSIBILITY.

06:06.083 --> 06:08.333
BUT LISTEN, WE SHOULD BE
FOCUSED ON THESE WOMEN

06:08.375 --> 06:11.125

I CA--I CANNOT IMAGINE
WHAT IT FEELS LIKE.

06:11.166 --> 06:13.125
IT'S HARD ENOUGH
TO CARRY YOUR OWN BABY.

06:13.166 --> 06:14.959
IMAGINE CARRYING
SOMEBODY ELSE'S.

06:15.000 --> 06:17.583

TO TERMINATE, START OVER.

06:17.625 --> 06:20.792
NO, THIS IS AMELIA'S LAST EMBRYO
WITH HER DEAD HUSBAND'S SPERM.
OH.

06:20.834 --> 06:23.333
THIS--THIS IS IT.
THERE ARE NO DO-OVERS.

06:23.375 --> 06:25.375

LAWSUITS, OUR REPUTATION.

TRYING TO DO DAMAGE CONTROL.

06:28.291 --> 06:30.375

06:30.417 --> 06:32.375

IS HIS SPECIALTY,

06:32.417 --> 06:35.417
AND--AND HE'S SOMEONE
WE CAN TRUST.
HE'S SOMEONE YOU CAN TRUST.

06:35.458 --> 06:37.834
I'LL GO AHEAD AND CALL HIM.
I-I SAID I'D CALL HIM.

06:37.875 --> 06:39.625
AS HEAD OF THE PRACTICE,

06:39.667 --> 06:41.625
I THINK THE CALL
SHOULD COME FROM ME.

06:41.667 --> 06:44.750
I'LL CALL HIM ON THE WAY
TO THE HOSPITAL.

06:47.083 --> 06:49.041

06:49.083 --> 06:51.041
HOW CAN THIS NOT BE

06:51.083 --> 06:53.041
I KNOW THIS IS DIFFICULT
TO DIGEST,

06:53.083 --> 06:56.041
AND I WISH I DIDN'T
HAVE TO TELL YOU THIS.

06:56.083 --> 06:59.041
WORDS CANNOT CONVEY
HOW SORRY I AM,

06:59.083 --> 07:02.208
AND... THERE'S NO EXPLANATION
I CAN OFFER YOU

07:02.250 --> 07:04.208
THAT CAN EXCUSE
WHAT'S HAPPENED.

07:04.250 --> 07:07.208
I CAN'T BELIEVE THIS.
THIS ISN'T HAPPENING.

07:07.250 --> 07:09.208
WE'VE SPENT TWO YEARS
TRYING TO GET PREGNANT,

07:09.250 --> 07:11.208
AND NOW--
THIS ISN'T MY BABY?

07:11.250 --> 07:13.834
YOU'RE TELLING ME THAT
THIS ISN'T...

07:13.875 --> 07:17.000
THIS ISN'T MY PREGNANCY?

07:18.709 --> 07:20.667
I SAW THE WADDLER
WALKING INTO HER OFFICE.

07:20.709 --> 07:23.041
I ASSUME THE GRASSHOPPER
WAS A FALSE ALARM.

07:23.083 --> 07:26.041
I SHOULD'VE CALLED YOU. I GOT
CAUGHT UP WITH SOME PATIENTS,

07:26.083 --> 07:29.417
AND, UH, WE GOT SOME STUFF
GOING ON HERE.
YOU'LL MAKE IT UP TO ME.

07:29.458 --> 07:31.750
I NEED YOU
TO BE MY BEARD.
OH.

07:31.792 --> 07:34.583
WILLIAM LEFT AGAIN
WITHOUT TALKING TO ME,

07:34.625 --> 07:36.875
BUT I FOUND OUT
WHERE HE'S GONNA BE LATER.

07:36.917 --> 07:40.041
I'LL BUMP INTO HIM, START
A CONVERSATION, IMPRESS HIM.
STALK HIM.

07:40.083 --> 07:42.792
WHAT DO I EVER ASK
FROM YOU, COOP?

07:42.834 --> 07:45.792
A LITTLE SLAP, A LITTLE TICKLE,
REPEAT AS NECESSARY.

07:45.834 --> 07:48.041
I EVEN LET YOU LIVE
WITH ANOTHER WOMAN.

07:48.083 --> 07:50.959
SO YOU WANT TO MAKE
AN ISSUE OF THIS,

07:51.000 --> 07:52.959
OR YOU WANT TO HELP ME?

07:53.000 --> 07:56.667
WHAT TIME SHOULD I BE THERE?

07:56.709 --> 07:59.792

GIVE ZOE SOME TIME--

08:04.083 --> 08:07.083
I KNOW THIS IS SO AWFUL,
BUT AT LEAST IT'S YOU.

08:07.125 --> 08:09.208
WE CAN DO IT, RIGHT?
WE CAN DO THIS?

08:09.250 --> 08:13.041
I'LL RESPECT YOUR WISHES ABOUT
THE BABY, ABOUT EVERYTHING.

08:13.083 --> 08:15.625
AND I'LL TRUST YOU
WITH MINE.

08:15.667 --> 08:18.041
AMELIA, I C--

08:18.083 --> 08:21.041
I CAN'T.
WE HAVE OTHER EMBRYOS STORED.

08:21.083 --> 08:23.208
WE'RE GONNA START OVER.

08:23.250 --> 08:25.208
NO, THAT'S MY BABY.
YOU CAN'T...

08:25.250 --> 08:27.208
I DON'T HAVE ANY OTHER EGGS.

08:27.250 --> 08:31.041
I'M CARRYING YOUR BABY.
I DON'T WANT THAT. I--

08:31.083 --> 08:33.750
WE WANT YOU TO FIX
THIS MISTAKE.
WHAT? YOU WANT ME
TO KILL THE BABY?

08:33.792 --> 08:36.750
I CAN'T DO THAT.
YOU CAN'T DO THAT.
WHOA. WAIT A MINUTE.

08:36.792 --> 08:40.583
WHY DON'T WE ALL JUST GO BACK
INTO MY OFFICE AND DISCUSS THIS?
NO, I JUST WANT
TO GO HOME.

08:40.625 --> 08:42.792
WELL, I WANT A LOT OF THINGS.
PLEASE, PLEASE.

08:42.834 --> 08:45.959
I WON'T DO THIS. I WILL NOT
END THIS PREGNANCY.

08:46.000 --> 08:47.542

TO THAT BABY,

08:47.583 --> 08:50.375

AND I'M GONNA KEEP IT!

08:50.417 --> 08:52.375
OH, HEY.
I SAW KATIE THIS MORNING.

08:52.417 --> 08:54.375

SHE'S OFF HER MEDS.

08:54.417 --> 08:57.166
KATIE? OH, NO.
SHE'S BEEN REALLY COMPLIANT.

08:57.208 --> 09:00.333
I MEAN, SHE'S CHEERFUL,
WHICH IS A CONCERN, BUT--
NOT CHEERFUL. SHE'S EUPHORIC.

09:00.375 --> 09:03.250
SHE'S TALKING ABOUT HER
MISCARRIAGE WITH EXCITEMENT.
WELL, WE HAVE A SESSION
THIS AFTERNOON.

09:03.291 --> 09:06.291
I'LL TALK TO HER
ABOUT IT THEN. THANKS.

09:13.667 --> 09:15.041
PETE.

09:15.083 --> 09:17.000
SHELDON.

09:19.208 --> 09:21.166
SHE STILL HASN'T
GIVEN ME AN ANSWER

09:21.208 --> 09:23.166
TO MY PROPOSAL.

09:23.208 --> 09:26.917
(sighs)
THIS IS AWKWARD, BETWEEN US.

09:26.959 --> 09:29.458
I MEAN, I LIKE YOU.
I DO, PETE.
ARE YOU GONNA PROPOSE TO ME?

09:29.500 --> 09:32.041
(laughs) YOU--
YOU'RE FUNNY.

09:32.083 --> 09:34.375
I BET SHE LIKES THAT.

09:34.417 --> 09:36.041

09:36.083 --> 09:39.208
WHICHEVER WAY THIS TURNS OUT,
I'LL KNOW.

09:39.250 --> 09:41.250
I'LL KNOW I TRIED.

09:44.750 --> 09:47.542

09:47.583 --> 09:49.542
NOTHING BIBLICAL ANYWAY.

09:49.583 --> 09:53.041
WELL, THERE'S COVETING.
OKAY, COVETING.
BUT THAT'S NOT THE BAD SIN.

09:53.083 --> 09:55.458
THERE ARE NO GOOD SINS.
ARE YOU EVEN RELIGIOUS?

09:55.500 --> 09:57.709
NO, NOT--
THEN WHY ARE WE
TALKING ABOUT SINS?

09:57.750 --> 10:00.709
YOU'RE THE ONE
WHO BROUGHT UP THE BIBLE.
I DID NOT.

10:00.750 --> 10:03.041

BROUGHT IT UP, OKAY?

10:03.083 --> 10:05.500

10:15.500 --> 10:17.041
AWFUL.

10:17.083 --> 10:21.041

I SHOULD TELL HER.

10:21.083 --> 10:23.041
YOU KNOW, THIS...

10:23.083 --> 10:25.041
THIS WILL
DESTROY HER LIFE.

10:25.083 --> 10:27.041
BUT AT LEAST
IT'LL BE HONEST,

10:27.083 --> 10:29.542
AND SHE DESERVES THE TRUTH.

10:32.834 --> 10:35.041
WE COULD BE TOGETHER.

10:35.083 --> 10:38.333
THINK ABOUT THAT.

10:38.375 --> 10:41.125
WE COULD BE TOGETHER.

10:44.917 --> 10:46.083

10:49.083 --> 10:51.500

YOU HURT YOUR KNUCKLES,

11:15.542 --> 11:18.000
YOU DON'T REALLY FEEL BETTER,
IT DOESN'T SOLVE ANYTHING.

11:18.041 --> 11:20.000

JUST A PACIFIST,

11:20.041 --> 11:22.000
'CAUSE I THINK
FIGHTING IS STUPID,

11:22.041 --> 11:24.500
I THINK WAR IS WRONG, AND TAKING
UP ARMS FOR SOME CAUSE

11:24.542 --> 11:27.959
JUST LACKS NOBILITY
IN TODAY'S WORLD. SO--
PETE, PETE--

11:28.000 --> 11:29.875
I'M NOT THE KINDA GUY
WHO FIGHTS,

11:29.917 --> 11:33.959

11:34.000 --> 11:35.959
I SHOULD'VE FOUGHT
FOR YOU, VIOLET.

11:36.000 --> 11:39.417

HOW ELSE TO SAY IT EXCEPT...

11:41.083 --> 11:43.333
I WANT YOUR KID,

11:43.375 --> 11:45.333
WHETHER IT'S MINE OR NOT.

11:45.375 --> 11:48.041

11:49.458 --> 11:51.959
WHETHER I HAVE TO FIGHT
FOR IT OR NOT.

11:52.000 --> 11:54.625

11:54.667 --> 11:56.625

12:05.417 --> 12:08.625

WE CAN BE SOMETHING.

12:30.083 --> 12:33.041
THIS IS NOT WHAT I WANT.

12:47.583 --> 12:49.542
A YEAR AGO,
I WAS STALKING A MAN

12:49.583 --> 12:51.417
WHO WANTED NOTHING
TO DO WITH ME,

12:51.458 --> 12:53.625
AND NOW I'M TURNING
TWO GOOD MEN DOWN.

12:53.667 --> 12:57.834
DO I HATE MYSELF? IS IT M-ME?
IS IT? AM I THE PROBLEM?

12:57.875 --> 12:59.834
DO YOU THINK
YOU'RE THE PROBLEM?

12:59.875 --> 13:01.875
OH, THAT'S VERY THERAPEUTIC,

13:01.917 --> 13:03.959
MAKING THE PATIENT
ANSWER HER OWN QUESTION.

13:04.000 --> 13:08.041
AND NOW I'M AVOIDING IT.
OKAY, DO YOU THINK ONE
OF THEM--PETE OR SHELDON--

13:08.083 --> 13:11.750
DO YOU THINK THAT COULD WORK?
YOU HAVE TO ANSWER THAT ONE.

13:11.792 --> 13:14.000
(footsteps approach)
I DON'T KNOW, COOPER!

13:14.041 --> 13:17.709
WELL--
DR. TURNER. HI.
NO ONE WAS UP FRONT.

13:17.750 --> 13:21.333
IT'S TIME
FOR MY APPOINTMENT, RIGHT?

13:21.375 --> 13:23.458
I THINK YOUR FOCUS NEEDS
TO BE ON DAMAGE CONTROL.

13:23.500 --> 13:26.250
FIRST, YOU WANT TO MITIGATE
PAIN AND SUFFERING.

13:26.291 --> 13:28.542
SO APPROACH EACH WOMAN
SEPARATELY ABOUT A SETTLEMENT.

13:28.583 --> 13:30.542
OFFER TO COVER
ALL MEDICAL EXPENSES

13:30.583 --> 13:32.542
AND MAKE A LARGE,
LUMP-SUM PAYMENT

13:32.583 --> 13:34.875
IN EXCHANGE FOR RELEASING
ALL CLAIMS

13:34.917 --> 13:37.375
AND SIGNING
A CONFIDENTIALITY AGREEMENT.

13:37.417 --> 13:40.125
YOU NEED TO SHOW THESE WOMEN
THAT SOMEONE HAS PAID

13:40.166 --> 13:43.208
FOR THE MISTAKE.

13:45.000 --> 13:47.125
YOU NEED TO FIRE DELL.

13:47.166 --> 13:49.041
NO.

13:49.083 --> 13:51.375
NO, NO, DELL--
DELL IS LIKE FAMILY,

13:51.417 --> 13:54.542
AND--AND WE DON'T EVEN KNOW
THAT THIS IS HIS FAULT.
YOU WANT TO DEFEND HIM?
FINE.

13:54.583 --> 13:57.125
BUT I DO NOT BELIEVE
THAT THIS WAS YOU.

13:57.166 --> 13:59.041
DELL IS FAMILY,

13:59.083 --> 14:02.750
BUT IF SAVING THE PRACTICE
MEANS CUTTING HIM LOOSE, THEN...

14:05.542 --> 14:07.625
ARE YOU FIRING ME?

14:10.083 --> 14:12.208
NO, BUT FOR NOW,
YOU'RE BEHIND A DESK,

14:12.250 --> 14:14.542

31:46.083 --> 31:48.041
KATIE,
I KNOW YOU CAN REMEMBER

31:48.083 --> 31:50.041
WHAT HAPPENED TO YOUR BABY.

31:50.083 --> 31:53.041
TRY. TRY AND THINK.

31:53.083 --> 31:57.041
(sighs) MY BABY DIED. THAT'S
WHAT YOU WANT ME TO SAY, RIGHT?

31:57.083 --> 31:58.875

31:58.917 --> 32:01.625

THE CORRECT ANSWER IS?

32:01.667 --> 32:03.041
MY BABY DIDN'T DIE.

32:03.083 --> 32:05.125
YOURS DIED,
SO YOU TOOK MINE.

32:05.166 --> 32:06.875
YOU STOLE MY BABY.

32:08.792 --> 32:10.959
BUT YOUR BABY WAS A GIRL.

32:11.000 --> 32:14.625
MINE IS A BOY.

32:14.667 --> 32:17.250
THERE'S A BOY IN HERE.

32:17.291 --> 32:20.083
I KNOW IT SOUNDS CRAZY.
I DO.

32:20.125 --> 32:23.041
BUT I'M NOT CRAZY.
I'M A NORMAL PERSON.

32:23.083 --> 32:25.959
I BELIEVE IT'S TRUE.
THIS IS MY BABY.

32:26.000 --> 32:28.041
AND IF I DON'T FOLLOW
MY INSTINCTS

32:28.083 --> 32:31.917
AND I LET YOU TAKE MY BABY--
KATIE, KATIE, LOOK AT ME.
LOOK AT ME.

32:31.959 --> 32:34.250
I BELIEVE YOU...

32:34.291 --> 32:37.041
THAT YOU THINK
THIS IS YOUR BABY.

32:37.083 --> 32:39.750
BUT I THINK
THIS IS MY BABY, TOO.

32:39.792 --> 32:41.875
IT HAS GROWN IN ME FOR MONTHS,

32:41.917 --> 32:44.000
AND I--AND I LOVE THIS BABY.

32:44.041 --> 32:47.125
AND I KNOW
YOU LOVE THIS BABY, TOO.

32:47.166 --> 32:49.458
SO IF YOU CUT...

32:49.500 --> 32:53.458

MIGHT GET HURT.

32:53.500 --> 32:58.875

TOO MUCH TO HURT IT, RIGHT?

32:58.917 --> 33:01.125

33:01.166 --> 33:04.917

HOW ARE YOU FEELING?

35:10.291 --> 35:12.834

35:12.875 --> 35:15.083
UH, EVERYTHING LOOKS FINE,

35:38.625 --> 35:40.041

35:48.709 --> 35:50.667
