00:02.628 --> 00:04.546
<i>Welcome to London Heathrow.</i>

00:04.546 --> 00:07.925
<i>For your security, do not leave
any personal items unattended.</i>

00:07.925 --> 00:12.930
<i>This is the final boarding call
for flight 822 to Kansas City.</i>

00:12.930 --> 00:16.225
<i>Final boarding for flight 822.</i>

00:26.360 --> 00:28.237
<i>Paging passenger Lasso.</i>

00:28.237 --> 00:29.905
<i>Report to the ticket desk.</i>

00:29.905 --> 00:33.700
<i>Paging passenger Lasso.
Please report to the ticket desk.</i>

00:34.576 --> 00:36.411
Buddy, we gotta roll. Come on. Let's go.

00:37.246 --> 00:38.497
Your mom sent you a text.

00:39.498 --> 00:40.499
Come on, go.

00:40.499 --> 00:43.836
- <i>Henry Lasso. Passenger Henry Lasso.</i>
- Hey, we're here. We're here.

00:43.836 --> 00:45.295
Sorry about that.

00:45.295 --> 00:46.547
We got distracted.

00:46.547 --> 00:49.341
Little guy was trying to unlock
Princess Peach on <i>Super Smash Bros</i>.

00:49.341 --> 00:50.801
Totally understand.

00:50.801 --> 00:52.636
I once held an entire
flight to Sydney hostage

00:52.636 --> 00:54.847
until I finished the final level of
<i>Breath of the Wild</i>.

00:55.514 --> 00:57.808
Feels like a potentially troublesome
sentence to say in this setting,

00:57.808 --> 00:59.101
but, hey, I appreciate you.

00:59.101 --> 01:02.980
Hello, Henry. It's nice to see you again.
Are you excited to head back home?

01:02.980 --> 01:04.857
To all my toys? Yes.

01:04.857 --> 01:07.651
To my country's political landscape?
Not so much.

01:08.861 --> 01:11.113
Yeah. Well, I have a tendency
to doze off with CNN on.

01:11.822 --> 01:14.366
All right, big guy.
Let's get you all set up here.

01:15.033 --> 01:16.994
iPad's all loaded up
with a bunch of movies,

01:16.994 --> 01:19.413
so no need to watch
your neighbor's screen, okay?

01:19.413 --> 01:22.499
Less movies about clowns in sewers,
the better, right?

01:22.499 --> 01:23.834
Amen, Big Ben.

01:23.834 --> 01:24.751
Oh, here.

01:24.751 --> 01:27.087
- Dad, I made you something.
- What you got?

01:28.505 --> 01:29.882
Hey.

01:29.882 --> 01:32.342
A little tiny Premier League trophy?
All right!

01:32.342 --> 01:34.511
I can't wait to drink champagne
out of this sucker, you know?

01:35.512 --> 01:38.557
I mean, it's just to have
until you win the real one.

01:38.557 --> 01:40.100
Well, hey. You never know, right?

01:40.100 --> 01:42.394
I'm sorry, Mr. Lasso,
but we are pressed for time.

01:42.394 --> 01:44.188
Of course. Of course. Okay.

01:44.938 --> 01:47.357
Six weeks goes by real quick
when you're having fun, don't it?

01:48.483 --> 01:49.902
Hey, do me a favor. When you get home,

01:49.902 --> 01:52.821
will you give your mom a big squeeze
from me to let her know I love her? Yeah?

01:52.821 --> 01:54.907
But until then, here, you bring it in.
Come on.

01:56.408 --> 01:57.409
All right.

01:59.036 --> 02:01.830
Okay. Okay. Hey. I love you, buddy.

02:01.830 --> 02:03.123
I love you too, Dad.

02:03.749 --> 02:06.793
Yeah. All right. Okay. Get out of here.

02:06.793 --> 02:07.878
Come on.

02:07.878 --> 02:12.341
<i>Passengers on Flight 2492
with service to JFK airport,</i>

02:12.341 --> 02:13.884
<i>we are now boarding.</i>

02:23.101 --> 02:29.024
<i>Flight to Amsterdam has been delayed
and will now be departing from Gate 17.</i>

02:29.024 --> 02:31.443
We apologize for any inconvenience.

02:36.657 --> 02:39.243
- <i>Good morning, Ted.</i>
- Hey, Doc.

02:40.661 --> 02:43.747
- <i>How're you feeling?</i>
- Yeah, no. I'm fine. Yeah.

02:49.336 --> 02:50.963
<i>So, how did the drop-off go?</i>

02:50.963 --> 02:52.130
<i>For me or for him?</i>

02:52.130 --> 02:54.091
<i>'Cause I think those
are two very different answers.</i>

02:54.091 --> 02:56.885
<i>But no, I'm fine, I think. I don't know.</i>

02:56.885 --> 02:59.304
<i>I just feel kinda guilty
about the little guy</i>

02:59.304 --> 03:01.306
<i>flying all by himself again, you know?</i>

03:02.099 --> 03:04.685
<i>I understand, Ted.
But children are resilient.</i>

03:04.685 --> 03:08.146
<i>And a sense of autonomy at Henry's age
is good for him.</i>

03:09.022 --> 03:10.482
<i>No, I know. That's true.</i>

03:11.650 --> 03:14.194
<i>I remember being left at school
when I was Henry's age.</i>

03:14.194 --> 03:16.780
<i>I ended up helping our custodian,
Mr. Maher, clean half the school</i>

03:16.780 --> 03:18.824
<i>until my dad remembered
to come pick me up.</i>

03:19.491 --> 03:21.660
<i>He gave Mr. Maher cash for babysitting me.</i>

03:21.660 --> 03:23.120
<i>I showed up to school the next day</i>

03:23.120 --> 03:26.164
<i>and Mr. Maher gave me the money
as payment for the work I'd done.</i>

03:26.164 --> 03:28.709
<i>So then I used that money
to buy him a thank-you gift,</i>

03:28.709 --> 03:30.419
<i>but never got the chance
to give it to him,</i>

03:30.419 --> 03:32.671
<i>'cause, well,
he ended up getting hit by a train.</i>

03:33.297 --> 03:35.048
<i>Wow. I didn't see that coming.</i>

03:35.048 --> 03:37.009
<i>Yeah, well, neither did Mr. Maher.</i>

03:38.260 --> 03:39.970
<i>How are things at work?</i>

03:39.970 --> 03:42.055
<i>Are you feeling good
about the upcoming season?</i>

03:42.055 --> 03:43.307
<i>Yeah. Sure.</i>

03:43.307 --> 03:46.643
<i>Well, I guess I do sometimes wonder
what the heck I'm still doing here.</i>

03:47.978 --> 03:50.105
<i>I mean, I know why I came,</i>

03:50.105 --> 03:52.733
<i>but it's the sticking around
I can't quite figure out.</i>

03:53.400 --> 03:56.570
- <i>You don't quit things, Ted.</i>
- <i>Right. Right. Yeah.</i>

03:56.570 --> 03:57.863
<i>But, hey, maybe my being here</i>

03:57.863 --> 04:00.365
<i>is doing more hurting than helping
at this point, you know?</i>

04:01.617 --> 04:05.287
<i>Well, as the man once said,
"Doubt can only be removed by action."</i>

04:05.287 --> 04:07.789
- <i>I like that.</i>
- <i>I thought you would.</i>

04:07.789 --> 04:10.667
- <i>We only have a couple of minutes left.</i>
- <i>Okay.</i>

04:10.667 --> 04:13.295
<i>Hey, you still cool with me
asking you some personal questions?</i>

04:14.379 --> 04:15.714
<i>For now, yes. Go on.</i>

04:15.714 --> 04:16.882
Hey!

04:16.882 --> 04:18.841
Holy smokes, I love that hat.

04:18.841 --> 04:21.386
I recognize you from that show
<i>Leaky Diapers</i>, don't I?

04:22.095 --> 04:24.473
- <i>Okay, let's see. You dating anyone?</i>
- <i>Pass.</i>

04:25.182 --> 04:27.184
<i>You usually say no to that one.</i>

04:27.184 --> 04:29.102
- <i>What team you with right now?</i>
- <i>Can't say.</i>

04:29.102 --> 04:31.271
- <i>Okay. All right. Well, what sport?</i>
- <i>Can't say.</i>

04:31.271 --> 04:33.190
<i>Uh-huh.
How many Australians you got on the team?</i>

04:33.190 --> 04:36.235
- <i>Nine.</i>
- <i>Rugby. What a game.</i>

04:36.235 --> 04:39.446
<i>It's like American football
and sumo wrestling gave birth to a baby</i>

04:39.446 --> 04:41.823
<i>with huge muscular thighs
all caked in mud.</i>

04:41.823 --> 04:43.200
Okay, Ted. I need to go.

04:43.200 --> 04:44.868
<i>Okay. Talk to you later, Doc.</i>

04:44.868 --> 04:46.787
- Goodbye, Ted.
- <i>All right now.</i>

04:58.882 --> 04:59.967
You finally got off.

05:00.634 --> 05:01.635
Not yet, I didn't.

05:30.455 --> 05:31.707
Bloody hell!

05:31.707 --> 05:35.669
All of them. All of them have us
finishing last this season.

05:35.669 --> 05:36.879
It's really annoying, isn't it?

05:36.879 --> 05:40.007
Every newspaper, every television pundit,

05:40.007 --> 05:45.804
every lonely middle-aged sports-blogging
loser writing in his mother's basement.

05:45.804 --> 05:48.932
You know, Rebecca,
that stereotype really isn't true anymore.

05:48.932 --> 05:51.894
For example, our ten-year-old, Terry,
started writing a sports blog

05:51.894 --> 05:54.813
in our kitchen,
which we now call his home office.

05:55.355 --> 05:56.356
For tax purposes.

05:56.356 --> 05:59.776
Right, well, I apologize
for the generalization.

06:00.903 --> 06:02.571
Where does your son have us finishing?

06:04.990 --> 06:06.617
- Hey, y'all.
- Hey, Ted.

06:06.617 --> 06:07.701
Good morning, Ted.

06:08.577 --> 06:10.662
No rhyming salutation. Something wrong?

06:10.662 --> 06:12.164
Way to notice, Amos Otis.

06:12.164 --> 06:14.499
Yeah.
Henry went back to Kansas this morning.

06:14.499 --> 06:16.043
- Thank you.
- Yep, yep.

06:16.043 --> 06:18.128
Dropped him off at the airport
a little bit ago.

06:18.128 --> 06:20.756
Now he's up in a plane,
10,000 feet in the sky.

06:20.756 --> 06:22.799
- I think they fly higher than that.
- Definitely.

06:22.799 --> 06:25.636
Yeah, well, I'm down here on Earth
checking my phone every ten minutes,

06:25.636 --> 06:28.847
watching his plane
get further and further away. Yeah.

06:28.847 --> 06:31.975
But, hey, I didn't mean to come in here
and tinkle on y'all's toenails.

06:31.975 --> 06:33.519
What's the buzz? Tell me what's happening.

06:33.519 --> 06:36.230
Well, apparently,
everyone alive has picked Richmond

06:36.230 --> 06:37.856
to finish in 20th place this season.

06:37.856 --> 06:39.650
Except the <i>Daily Mirror</i>,

06:39.650 --> 06:41.568
which has us finishing "twentyelf."

06:41.568 --> 06:43.820
An adorable but devastating typo.

06:43.820 --> 06:44.905
Okay. Well, you know what?

06:44.905 --> 06:47.157
I predict all their
predictions ain't gonna come true.

06:47.157 --> 06:49.743
So, it looks like we got ourselves
a prediction Mexican standoff.

06:49.743 --> 06:51.787
Or as they call them in Mexico,
a prediction standoff.

06:52.454 --> 06:53.747
Well, the worst part is that

06:53.747 --> 06:55.958
they've picked Rupert
to finish in the top four.

06:55.958 --> 06:57.292
Rupert's gonna play this year?

06:57.292 --> 06:58.627
What? No.

06:58.627 --> 07:00.045
So you mean West Ham?

07:00.045 --> 07:02.422
Precisely.
Everyone thinks he's better than us.

07:02.422 --> 07:05.259
They.
Everyone thinks they are better than us.

07:05.259 --> 07:06.844
Yes, that's what I said. They.

07:06.844 --> 07:09.346
So, what's the plan?
How are we gonna beat him?

07:09.346 --> 07:10.806
- Them.
- Exactly.

07:10.806 --> 07:11.974
Oh, boy.

07:11.974 --> 07:14.184
You know, this might be a good time

07:14.184 --> 07:17.771
for us to update our roster.
Put some more firepower in the team.

07:17.771 --> 07:19.898
That is a great idea, Leslie.

07:19.898 --> 07:22.568
Let's put some feelers out, shall we? Ted?

07:22.568 --> 07:24.361
Well, I know Roy and Coach Beard

07:24.361 --> 07:26.029
are working on some new tactics.

07:26.029 --> 07:28.490
And, you know, the fellas we got
are already gelling real nice.

07:28.490 --> 07:30.033
I think we're gonna do fine this season.

07:30.033 --> 07:32.536
Ted, this team doing "just fine"
is a far cry

07:32.536 --> 07:34.454
from you telling me
we're going to win the whole thing.

07:35.330 --> 07:36.415
Did I really say that?

07:36.415 --> 07:39.251
Yes, you did.
Over there after the Man City loss.

07:39.251 --> 07:42.254
Just before you blasted
half a liter of Pellegrino in my face.

07:42.254 --> 07:44.298
- Right.
- Wait, what happened?

07:44.298 --> 07:47.593
That is the Ted Lasso
I want coaching my team this season.

07:47.593 --> 07:49.344
The one who's willing to fight.

07:49.344 --> 07:50.804
- Understood?
- Yes, ma'am.

07:50.804 --> 07:51.889
You watch, from now on,

07:51.889 --> 07:54.141
I'll be floating like a butterfly
and stinging like a bee.

07:54.141 --> 07:56.185
Except I won't die immediately
after using my stinger.

07:56.185 --> 07:58.562
I plan to float and sting
for the entirety of the whole season.

07:59.229 --> 08:01.773
Excellent. Right, if you'll excuse me,

08:02.274 --> 08:05.736
I have a very important lunch meeting
with one Ms. Keeley Jones

08:05.736 --> 08:07.779
for some much-needed girl talk.

08:07.779 --> 08:09.573
Hey, tell her we said howdy and...

08:10.157 --> 08:11.158
Yo.

08:11.909 --> 08:12.910
Okay.

08:14.411 --> 08:16.121
- You say "yo"?
- Yeah, I know. It just popped out--

08:16.121 --> 08:17.456
No. I'm not judging. I loved it.

08:17.456 --> 08:18.790
- I wanna make sure I heard right.
- Okay. Yeah.

08:19.499 --> 08:21.668
- But I-- But I feel like...
- Yeah.

08:21.668 --> 08:23.128
That makes sense, right? I could put my--

08:23.128 --> 08:25.672
What? Another one? Dead last.

08:26.757 --> 08:28.550
Dead last? Who wrote that?

08:28.550 --> 08:30.052
Fucking everybody, bruv.

08:30.052 --> 08:32.929
Glenn Hoddle, Graeme Souness,
Jermaine Jenas--

08:32.929 --> 08:36.475
- Maybe they're trying to motivate us.
- Yeah. Thank you very much, Dani.

08:36.475 --> 08:38.184
I had a woman accost me on the street,

08:38.184 --> 08:39.977
telling me I should fake an injury
this season

08:39.977 --> 08:41.522
so I wouldn't have to deal
with the misery.

08:41.522 --> 08:42.856
Did you tell her to piss off?

08:42.856 --> 08:44.274
No, she was a nun.

08:45.859 --> 08:46.944
Wait, a nun?

08:47.528 --> 08:49.404
They must get Sky Sports
in the monasteries.

08:50.155 --> 08:51.823
Hey. Hey, hey, lads. Hey.

08:51.823 --> 08:53.867
We ain't gonna get relegated
'cause we're together.

08:55.285 --> 08:57.704
And together, we got me.

08:59.164 --> 09:00.582
Statistically speaking,

09:00.582 --> 09:03.252
most teams who get promoted
are relegated the very next year.

09:03.252 --> 09:06.338
- Come on, Jan Maas!
- Jan Maas!

09:06.338 --> 09:09.007
- That's what happens in the Pre--
- Shut the fuck up, Jan Maas.

09:09.007 --> 09:11.802
It's the Premier League.
It's just statistics, man.

09:12.845 --> 09:14.304
So I finally watched it.

09:15.639 --> 09:17.015
I liked it.

09:17.558 --> 09:18.767
Gene Hackman was good.

09:19.601 --> 09:21.270
The drunk geezer.

09:21.270 --> 09:22.354
Stuff with the team.

09:23.522 --> 09:24.648
I did have one question.

09:24.648 --> 09:25.941
Yeah, what's that?

09:25.941 --> 09:28.193
Why the fuck is it called <i>Hoosiers</i>?

09:29.319 --> 09:30.863
Hey, what's up, sweetie pie?

09:31.572 --> 09:32.990
What's the frequency, Roy Kenteth?

09:32.990 --> 09:34.950
What you doing?
Working on new trick plays or something?

09:34.950 --> 09:37.786
No tricks, just an old classic.
Take it away, Coach.

09:37.786 --> 09:40.289
This is the best way
for us to play this season.

09:40.289 --> 09:42.457
The 4-4-2, which is--

09:42.457 --> 09:44.918
Four defenders, four in the midfield,
and two up front.

09:44.918 --> 09:45.836
Yeah, I got it.

09:45.836 --> 09:47.129
God, I'm proud of you.

09:47.129 --> 09:49.548
Yeah. Henry and I played
a whole bunch of FIFA while he was here.

09:49.548 --> 09:51.967
Very helpful. You know,
we both learned who Maradona was,

09:51.967 --> 09:55.137
and I had to explain to my son
why cocaine is actually bad for you.

09:55.137 --> 09:56.180
Please, keep going.

09:56.180 --> 09:59.766
Right. These little pricks have played
4-4-2 ever since they were kids,

09:59.766 --> 10:02.269
which means they'll always know
what they're supposed to do,

10:02.269 --> 10:04.605
and more importantly,
where they're supposed to be

10:04.605 --> 10:07.357
at every fucking minute
of every fucking game

10:07.357 --> 10:09.026
against every fucking opponent.

10:09.026 --> 10:11.945
Yeesh. Who invented this thing,
the Russians?

10:11.945 --> 10:13.238
Yeah.

10:13.238 --> 10:14.531
Okay.

10:14.531 --> 10:17.201
Well, hey, if you think it's a good idea,
I think it's a great one.

10:17.201 --> 10:18.452
- Let's do it.
- Okay.

10:19.161 --> 10:22.039
And look, I know I don't have
Nate's fucking tactical super-brain,

10:22.831 --> 10:25.709
but I do know it's more important
to be solid than clever

10:25.709 --> 10:26.793
when you're the underdogs.

10:26.793 --> 10:29.713
Yeah, the underdog. Right. No.
Okay. I hear you, loud and clear. Yeah.

10:29.713 --> 10:31.882
Hey, Coach.
How come you never hear of an "overdog"?

10:32.883 --> 10:37.304
In German, the "<i>Überhund</i>,"
but in English, we say "top dog."

10:37.304 --> 10:40.682
Or more specifically, West Ham.

11:05.040 --> 11:07.042
Good morning, Coach Shelley.

11:34.069 --> 11:35.654
There he is. The Wonder Kid himself.

11:35.654 --> 11:36.697
Get out.

11:50.460 --> 11:51.587
I understand.

11:51.587 --> 11:53.964
I just don't think Ms. Welton
will have a whole lot to say

11:53.964 --> 11:57.676
about the unfair advantage
of being a female owner in sports.

11:57.676 --> 11:58.844
Thank you.

12:00.012 --> 12:01.305
Fuck you, Joe Rogan.

12:07.019 --> 12:07.936
Sorry, everyone.

12:07.936 --> 12:11.064
This is my friend, my former boss,

12:11.064 --> 12:14.443
my angel-mentor-guru, Rebecca.

12:15.110 --> 12:20.157
And, Rebecca, these are the poets
and the geniuses behind KJPR.

12:20.908 --> 12:22.576
- Hello.
- Hello.

12:23.577 --> 12:25.329
Why don't you step into my office?

12:25.329 --> 12:26.914
Yeah? Come on. Yeah.

12:28.415 --> 12:30.876
God, it's like a real office out there.

12:30.876 --> 12:33.754
People typing and being awkward
and everything.

12:33.754 --> 12:35.506
It's so bananas, right?

12:36.089 --> 12:38.550
And I found out
why I got such a good deal on this place.

12:39.176 --> 12:41.261
I love a bit of corporate
real estate scuttlebutt.

12:41.261 --> 12:42.262
That. Yeah.

12:42.262 --> 12:43.889
So, the previous tenants,

12:43.889 --> 12:46.433
they had to break the lease
because the boss kept getting caught

12:46.433 --> 12:48.852
pinching his employees' butts
all the time.

12:48.852 --> 12:52.231
Well, one man's grope
is another woman's gain.

12:52.231 --> 12:55.359
It does explain why my office
comes with fun features like this.

12:55.359 --> 12:56.443
Look. Watch.

12:58.820 --> 13:01.615
Yikes. But also quite cool.

13:05.202 --> 13:06.495
Hey, it's all right.

13:06.995 --> 13:07.996
Hey!

13:08.497 --> 13:11.208
Hey, you're all right. I'm here. Hey.

13:11.208 --> 13:15.170
I'm so busy, I literally have to make time
in my schedule

13:15.170 --> 13:17.673
to sit at my desk and cry.

13:19.424 --> 13:21.343
And now I've double-booked you.

13:21.343 --> 13:23.720
Come here!

13:28.392 --> 13:29.810
You know who else
picked us to finish last?

13:29.810 --> 13:30.936
Please don't say Adele.

13:30.936 --> 13:32.062
Paddington Bear.

13:32.563 --> 13:34.731
- It was on his Twitter account.
- Yeah, I saw that.

13:34.731 --> 13:37.776
On a scale of one marmalade sandwich
to five marmalade sandwiches,

13:37.776 --> 13:39.152
we've got no marmalade sandwiches.

13:39.152 --> 13:42.322
Even that sweet little bear
does not believe in us.

13:42.322 --> 13:44.533
I think it's probably
other people writing for him.

13:44.533 --> 13:46.827
- Wait, what?
- Yeah.

13:48.036 --> 13:49.913
What the heck is going on out here?

13:49.913 --> 13:53.000
These guys are more distracted
than a bunch of cats playing laser tag.

13:53.000 --> 13:55.169
They heard all the pundits saying we suck.

13:55.169 --> 13:56.336
Fuck pundits.

13:56.336 --> 13:57.504
You were a pundit.

13:57.504 --> 14:01.633
Yeah. And all we did was talk shit
and eat fucking meringues.

14:02.301 --> 14:04.928
Hey, Coach,
I don't know about you, but kinda feels

14:04.928 --> 14:06.805
like it's getting
a little stuffy in here, yeah?

14:06.805 --> 14:10.058
Like one of those days
you wanna have class outside?

14:12.227 --> 14:14.563
What the fuck are you two talking about?
We are outside.

14:16.481 --> 14:17.649
- Hey, Will.
- Yeah?

14:17.649 --> 14:19.234
- Come here.
- Yeah.

14:19.234 --> 14:20.861
Hey, is Kenneth around today?

14:21.486 --> 14:22.613
Yeah, no. Kenneth lives here.

14:22.613 --> 14:24.948
Yeah. No, he does work a lot, don't he?

14:24.948 --> 14:27.951
No, no, no. As in,
he literally lives here at the facility.

14:27.951 --> 14:29.828
- He does? Since when?
- He--

14:29.828 --> 14:31.955
Ever since his cult got shut down.

14:32.539 --> 14:33.624
Kenneth was in a cult?

14:33.624 --> 14:36.168
No, no, no, no, no.
He was the leader of one.

14:36.168 --> 14:37.711
Wow. Okay.

14:38.212 --> 14:40.339
You mind asking him to bring
the team bus around for me?

14:40.339 --> 14:41.882
- Yeah, yeah.
- All right. Appreciate you.

14:44.301 --> 14:45.677
Shall we?

14:46.887 --> 14:47.888
Okay, fellas.

14:47.888 --> 14:50.974
This segment of today's training
is now complete.

14:50.974 --> 14:53.685
I need everyone to go hop on the bus.

14:53.685 --> 14:55.312
We're taking practice on the road,

14:55.312 --> 14:58.607
and last one in the parking lot
has to eat a little bug!

14:58.607 --> 15:00.567
Everyone run except Roy! Let's go!

15:02.152 --> 15:04.655
- Run, run, run!
- Let's go, let's go!

15:07.574 --> 15:10.035
I feel so much better.

15:10.035 --> 15:13.622
Crying is the best, isn't it?
It's like an orgasm for the soul.

15:15.165 --> 15:16.875
You know, in the last three years
married to Rupert,

15:16.875 --> 15:19.503
I don't think I cried once about anything.

15:20.379 --> 15:22.422
Not even a John Lewis
Christmas commercial.

15:23.131 --> 15:24.842
I'm really sorry again about your blouse.

15:24.842 --> 15:26.844
What are you talking about?
It's barely noticeable.

15:29.513 --> 15:33.225
Oi, sucks butt that everyone's
predicted Richmond to finish last.

15:33.225 --> 15:35.269
I mean, what filthy cocks.

15:35.269 --> 15:36.895
You're not worried
about that though, right?

15:36.895 --> 15:38.272
No, not really.

15:39.398 --> 15:41.775
I'm a bit worried
that Ted isn't worried enough.

15:41.775 --> 15:43.694
Yeah, but you gotta let Ted be Ted, right?

15:44.403 --> 15:46.196
Yes. I suppose so.

15:47.656 --> 15:52.202
No, I'm more bothered that Rupert
must just be so happy right now.

15:52.202 --> 15:54.872
He's really gotten stuck in your head
these days, huh?

15:54.872 --> 15:56.290
No!

15:56.290 --> 15:58.000
I mean, yes.

15:58.000 --> 16:00.961
But he's not stuck
in the same way he used to be stuck.

16:00.961 --> 16:03.005
I mean, back then,

16:03.005 --> 16:07.384
I wanted to destroy everything
that Rupert loved and owned and coveted.

16:07.384 --> 16:09.219
You know, like Left Eye from TLC

16:09.219 --> 16:11.180
when she burned
all her boyfriend's trainers in the bath

16:11.180 --> 16:12.723
and ended up
burning down the entire house.

16:12.723 --> 16:14.975
- Ultimate gangster move.
- Fucking legend.

16:15.475 --> 16:17.686
And admittedly, that was me back then.

16:18.478 --> 16:22.149
But the me now doesn't feel the need
to destroy Rupert's life.

16:23.358 --> 16:25.110
No, the now me just wants to beat him.

16:25.611 --> 16:26.445
To win.

16:28.488 --> 16:30.032
- That's growth, right?
- Sure.

16:30.782 --> 16:33.410
But sometimes
you've gotta let Rupert be Rupert too.

16:35.204 --> 16:37.539
Ms. Jones, we have a problem.

16:38.123 --> 16:39.958
Barbara, come on. It's Keeley.

16:39.958 --> 16:42.211
And I want you to meet
my dear friend, Rebecca.

16:42.211 --> 16:43.962
She owns AFC Richmond.

16:43.962 --> 16:45.214
Yes, of course, Rebecca.

16:45.214 --> 16:46.840
- Very nice to meet you.
- Hello, Barbara.

16:46.840 --> 16:48.050
Ms. Jones,

16:48.050 --> 16:53.764
I noticed a business expense
for flowers recurring weekly.

16:54.765 --> 16:58.018
You want to spend £200 every week
on flowers?

16:58.018 --> 16:59.061
Yeah.

16:59.061 --> 17:00.145
Why?

17:00.145 --> 17:02.564
So the office is cheerful and smells nice.

17:03.273 --> 17:06.609
Flowers are for two things, Ms. Jones.
Dead people and dead marriages.

17:08.487 --> 17:10.948
- It was so nice to meet you.
- It was nice to meet you.

17:13.575 --> 17:15.452
She seems fun.

17:15.452 --> 17:17.246
She's my CFO.

17:18.121 --> 17:20.332
The company that financed me
placed her here.

17:20.332 --> 17:23.919
But she's my CFO, yet sometimes my CFO--

17:23.919 --> 17:25.587
Chief Financial Officer.

17:25.587 --> 17:27.297
Oh, my. I did not know that.

17:27.297 --> 17:30.300
I've been saying "corporate flying object"
'cause it's been making me laugh.

17:30.300 --> 17:31.718
Why didn't you just google it?

17:32.928 --> 17:34.179
Because I trust in the universe.

17:36.056 --> 17:37.349
Right. I have got to get going.

17:39.226 --> 17:40.394
Dinner this evening?

17:40.394 --> 17:42.938
- I can't.
- No, no. I'm eating meat again.

17:42.938 --> 17:45.858
That's not it. But thank Christ.

17:45.858 --> 17:49.778
No, Roy and I are finally
having the talk with Phoebe.

17:50.863 --> 17:53.073
I cannot cancel on him again,
or he will kill me.

17:53.073 --> 17:55.909
Okay, well, call me later.

17:55.909 --> 17:57.119
And thank you for the advice.

17:57.703 --> 17:59.746
- Thank you for your bosom.
- Anytime.

18:06.920 --> 18:09.590
You. Come over here. Come over here.

18:09.590 --> 18:12.718
Come and stand on this line for me.
This, over here. Yeah.

18:13.218 --> 18:15.137
This is a very important line.

18:15.971 --> 18:18.974
Everyone, this is the dumb-dumb line.

18:20.184 --> 18:21.602
This is where dumb-dumbs go.

18:22.686 --> 18:23.520
Stay.

18:23.520 --> 18:26.732
You, go in for the dumb-dumb.
Try not to join him on the line. Go.

18:32.196 --> 18:33.363
Coach Shelley?

18:33.864 --> 18:34.698
Yes. Yes?

18:34.698 --> 18:36.700
Mr. Mannion would like to speak with you.

18:36.700 --> 18:38.118
Okay. Thank you very much.

18:43.165 --> 18:44.166
Now?

18:45.375 --> 18:46.460
Disco.

18:46.460 --> 18:47.377
Yeah.

18:47.377 --> 18:49.880
Take over here. Five more minutes of this,
then run them till they drop.

18:49.880 --> 18:51.882
- Okay.
- All right. Let's--

18:53.133 --> 18:54.259
Gosh.

18:55.844 --> 18:56.970
Okay.

18:56.970 --> 19:01.183
Just because my name is Disco
doesn't mean we get to party, yeah?

19:07.981 --> 19:12.277
There he is. The Wonder Kid himself.

19:12.861 --> 19:14.446
Hello. How was your trip?

19:14.446 --> 19:16.281
Wonderful. Yeah.

19:16.281 --> 19:20.285
I was in St. Barts with dear friends,
the Sacklers.

19:21.286 --> 19:24.456
We were legally required
to stay 50 miles offshore,

19:24.456 --> 19:27.167
but what a beautiful boat.

19:27.167 --> 19:28.794
Well, sounds lovely.

19:29.545 --> 19:35.467
What's lovely are these delightful
preseason prognostications. Yeah.

19:35.467 --> 19:36.802
Aren't they delish?

19:37.344 --> 19:38.929
Especially poor, old Richmond.

19:40.430 --> 19:43.934
Can you believe
they're picked to finish 20th?

19:44.518 --> 19:46.937
Well, yeah, because there's no 21st.

19:50.941 --> 19:52.192
That's very good.

19:53.652 --> 19:56.905
I hope you've got more zingers like that
in your back pocket for the presser today.

19:56.905 --> 19:58.532
I-- Yeah, I might.

19:59.616 --> 20:03.328
You know, they didn't know
what they had, letting you go.

20:04.288 --> 20:06.248
Nathan Shelley, you are a killer.

20:09.168 --> 20:10.627
Thank you, Mr. Mannion.

20:10.627 --> 20:12.963
No, please, Nathan. Call me Rupert.

20:15.007 --> 20:18.594
Mr. Mannion, the car is being removed
from the lot as we speak.

20:20.637 --> 20:23.432
- Good.
- Security thinks one of the new cleaners

20:23.432 --> 20:25.851
must have parked in the prestige lot
by accident.

20:26.435 --> 20:27.436
Yes.

20:28.854 --> 20:31.231
And accidents have repercussions.

20:31.231 --> 20:33.650
I just want to just have a look.

20:34.568 --> 20:35.861
Yes, that's my car.

20:38.739 --> 20:40.866
- Sorry.
- Is it really?

20:41.408 --> 20:43.285
No. Well, yes.

20:43.285 --> 20:46.997
I mean, it's the one that I drove here in,
but is anything really ours?

20:47.789 --> 20:48.624
I can move it.

20:48.624 --> 20:50.417
No, it's okay.

20:51.710 --> 20:53.003
My apologies, Nathan.

20:53.921 --> 20:56.757
Ms. Kakes, let security know
that we have found

20:56.757 --> 21:01.637
the automobile's owner,
and everything's fine.

21:01.637 --> 21:02.971
Yes, Mr. Mannion.

21:05.432 --> 21:06.767
- Nathan?
- Yeah?

21:07.559 --> 21:09.061
I know you'll make me proud.

21:10.312 --> 21:11.522
I believe in you.

21:12.314 --> 21:15.817
Thank you, Mr. Rupert. Just Rupert.

21:15.817 --> 21:16.902
Plain Rupert.

21:17.986 --> 21:19.071
Rupert.

21:20.989 --> 21:22.032
- Thanks, Ken.
- Have a good one, lad.

21:22.032 --> 21:24.076
- Cheers, Ken.
- Look after yourselves.

21:24.076 --> 21:25.911
- Thanks, K-Rock.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

21:25.911 --> 21:28.664
Hey, Ken, thanks again
for helping us out at the last second.

21:28.664 --> 21:30.874
No worries. You got lucky, really.

21:31.375 --> 21:33.418
Ted, it's a good rule of thumb

21:33.418 --> 21:36.004
never to ask a hippie
to come in on his day off.

21:37.548 --> 21:39.675
- Okay, message received.
- All right.

21:39.675 --> 21:42.219
Well, I'll go and smoke some toad venom
while I'm waiting.

21:42.219 --> 21:44.471
Then the whole day's not a waste. Cheers.

21:44.471 --> 21:46.139
Okay. Yeah.

21:47.140 --> 21:48.642
He gonna be okay to drive us back?

21:48.642 --> 21:50.143
- After the toad venom?
- Yeah.

21:50.143 --> 21:51.812
He's usually fine in 20 minutes.

21:51.812 --> 21:55.315
He'll be forever changed,
but he can drive, yeah.

21:55.315 --> 21:56.400
Okay, good.

21:56.400 --> 21:58.068
All right, fellas. Follow me.

22:01.321 --> 22:02.364
There he is.

22:03.407 --> 22:04.908
Good to see you again, Coach Lasso.

22:04.908 --> 22:06.326
Hey, nice to see you too, Ivor.

22:06.326 --> 22:07.286
All right.

22:07.286 --> 22:08.662
Come on, fellas. Here we are.

22:09.496 --> 22:11.206
- This is the spot here?
- Yes, sir.

22:11.206 --> 22:12.332
All righty.

22:12.332 --> 22:15.335
Okay, here we go, guys. Down the hatch.

22:15.335 --> 22:16.753
- Nah.
- What?

22:16.753 --> 22:18.672
- Yeah, we're going down here.
- What's he talking about?

22:18.672 --> 22:19.756
Yeah, yeah, go ahead.

22:22.134 --> 22:23.468
Yeah. Nah, it's gonna be fine.

22:26.722 --> 22:28.265
Del, look at this shit.

22:29.349 --> 22:30.851
- Yeah, why don't you go next?
- All right.

22:31.518 --> 22:32.477
Is that Roy Kent?

22:32.477 --> 22:33.687
I don't know.

22:33.687 --> 22:35.814
Roy Kent, is that you?

22:36.440 --> 22:37.441
Get fucked.

22:38.483 --> 22:40.110
- Yeah, definitely him.
- Yeah, that's him.

22:44.448 --> 22:45.908
- Get that on Twitter, son.
- Yes.

23:00.130 --> 23:03.008
I just wanted to go through
this transfer list.

23:03.008 --> 23:04.801
Some good options here.

23:06.470 --> 23:08.722
Why are you dressed like an umlaut?

23:09.515 --> 23:10.432
Keeley tears.

23:11.725 --> 23:14.186
I've had this dry cleaned now six times.

23:15.312 --> 23:17.814
Can't believe she wears
stuff like this on her eyes.

23:17.814 --> 23:18.941
Right. Come here.

23:23.820 --> 23:25.030
Are you sure you want to watch this?

23:25.030 --> 23:27.741
No, I don't want to, Leslie.
But it's part of my job.

23:28.408 --> 23:29.409
I need to be ready to comment

23:29.409 --> 23:31.537
if Rupert were to say something snide
about me or the team.

23:32.246 --> 23:33.705
Where are they, by the way?

23:33.705 --> 23:35.165
Shouldn't they be training now?

23:41.880 --> 23:45.759
Yeah, come on down, fellas.
That's it. All right.

23:45.759 --> 23:51.098
Greyhounds, behold the majesty
of the London sewer system.

23:53.225 --> 23:54.142
Disgusting.

23:54.142 --> 23:56.395
Yeah, that's what I thought
at first as well.

23:56.395 --> 23:59.690
But then, over the summer, Henry and I
took a tour of this place with Ivor here.

23:59.690 --> 24:01.900
Why would you take your kid
for a tour of a sewer?

24:01.900 --> 24:03.193
Well, it was his idea, actually.

24:03.193 --> 24:05.779
See, what happened was,
on his plane ride over here,

24:05.779 --> 24:09.116
the fellow sitting next to him
was watching that horror movie <i>It</i>,

24:09.116 --> 24:11.493
and, well, Henry accidentally
ended up watching it too.

24:12.828 --> 24:14.204
So then, when he heard about this tour,

24:14.204 --> 24:16.415
he asked to go on it
in order to face his fears.

24:16.415 --> 24:17.416
Fucking smart.

24:17.416 --> 24:19.209
Yeah, that is good.

24:19.209 --> 24:21.670
Ain't much scarier out there
than a creepy clown, right?

24:23.297 --> 24:26.675
Ladies and gentlemen of the press, welcome.

24:26.675 --> 24:29.469
Lovely to see you all, and thank you

24:29.469 --> 24:34.016
for selecting our humble little
football club to do so well this season.

24:37.728 --> 24:39.104
Twat.

24:39.104 --> 24:41.190
Ivor, my friend, why don't you
help these fine fellows

24:41.190 --> 24:43.150
with some fun facts
about this here feces factory?

24:43.150 --> 24:46.195
Well, back in 1859,

24:46.195 --> 24:49.072
an engineer called Joseph Bazalgette
and his team

24:49.072 --> 24:54.203
built more than 1,200 miles
of interconnected tunnels and sewers.

24:54.203 --> 24:58.582
And its creation helped cure
a massive cholera outbreak

24:58.582 --> 25:02.211
after untreated human waste
found its way into the River Thames.

25:03.045 --> 25:05.380
Anyone know what that epidemic was called?

25:05.380 --> 25:07.216
Great Stink of 1858.

25:07.216 --> 25:08.383
That's correct.

25:10.260 --> 25:11.720
All right, go ahead, Ivor. Keep cooking.

25:11.720 --> 25:14.264
The person you are here to see,

25:14.264 --> 25:16.892
the Wonder Kid himself,

25:16.892 --> 25:18.435
our new manager,

25:19.561 --> 25:20.437
Nathan Shelley.

25:29.738 --> 25:32.533
Thank you. Very nice to be here.

25:33.367 --> 25:35.077
I'm pretty sure I said "wunderkind."

25:38.622 --> 25:40.916
Doesn't-- It doesn't matter. Doesn't--

25:44.294 --> 25:45.629
Sorry, does anyone have any questions?

25:47.881 --> 25:50.133
- Yes, you. Thank you.
- How are you and the lads getting on?

25:50.133 --> 25:51.385
Yeah, really great.

25:52.636 --> 25:53.971
Getting to know them.

25:54.596 --> 25:56.181
Getting to know all about them.

25:57.266 --> 25:58.642
Getting to like them.

26:00.936 --> 26:02.563
Getting to hope--

26:07.359 --> 26:08.610
Excuse me a second.

26:15.701 --> 26:17.369
What is he doing?

26:32.426 --> 26:35.179
Sorry, just had to tie my shoe.

26:36.763 --> 26:38.724
Yeah, next question, please.
Thank you. Yes?

26:38.724 --> 26:40.642
Coach Shelley,

26:40.642 --> 26:43.562
you are now the manager
of a contending Premier League team,

26:43.562 --> 26:48.901
but just two years ago, you were a mere
kit man, washing another team's underwear.

26:48.901 --> 26:53.864
I mean, it must all feel
a bit overwhelming for you, yes?

26:55.908 --> 26:58.785
Not for me, no. Because I earned this job.

26:59.703 --> 27:01.830
What's overwhelming
is the confusion I feel

27:01.830 --> 27:05.209
when someone so intelligent-looking
asks such a stupid question.

27:10.923 --> 27:11.924
Meow.

27:12.424 --> 27:13.717
<i>Anyone else?</i>

27:13.717 --> 27:16.053
- Yeah, I got a question.
- Yeah, go ahead, Isaac.

27:16.053 --> 27:17.387
What the fuck are we doing here?

27:20.807 --> 27:22.267
Silence!

27:22.768 --> 27:24.811
Thank you, Coach.
That's a good question, Isaac.

27:24.811 --> 27:28.440
And direct, which is a personality trait
y'all's generation has truly embraced,

27:28.440 --> 27:32.402
and I tell you what,
I've grown used to it, so I appreciate it.

27:32.402 --> 27:35.030
Yeah, well, hey, fellas,
take a look around.

27:35.906 --> 27:37.449
What are we surrounded by down here?

27:38.075 --> 27:39.535
- Coach.
- Yeah, Jamie.

27:39.535 --> 27:42.246
- We're surrounded by poopy.
- That's right.

27:42.246 --> 27:43.163
But if you ask me,

27:43.163 --> 27:46.583
we're surrounded by a whole bunch
of poopy up there as well, yeah?

27:47.835 --> 27:52.297
See, gentlemen, right now, y'all's brains
are basically London in 1857.

27:52.297 --> 27:55.008
They're blocked up
by other people's dookie.

27:55.843 --> 28:00.138
Y'all need to make an internal
sewer system within yourselves,

28:00.138 --> 28:04.184
and then connect to each other's tunnels,
help each other keep that flow.

28:05.060 --> 28:08.188
So if you're ever having
a crisis of confidence,

28:08.188 --> 28:10.440
you know, borrow some of Jamie's.

28:11.275 --> 28:15.571
Yeah? Or if you're feeling down,
you know, get some Dani in your life.

28:15.571 --> 28:19.491
Or you can learn from Richard's
vast knowledge of expensive wines.

28:19.491 --> 28:24.162
Fine wines, Coach.
The thing is, a great bottle of wine

28:24.162 --> 28:28.041
really doesn't need to be
an expensive bottle of wine, you get it?

28:28.625 --> 28:31.253
All right, see? That's wisdom right there.

28:31.253 --> 28:32.171
<i>Merci beaucoup.</i>

28:34.131 --> 28:35.632
Yeah. Next question.

28:35.632 --> 28:40.304
Coach Shelley,
regarding your old team, AFC Richmond,

28:40.304 --> 28:45.058
any idea why everyone is expecting them
to finish 20th this season?

28:48.437 --> 28:50.689
Probably because there's no 21st.

28:52.566 --> 28:53.567
Ouch.

28:54.193 --> 28:57.696
Guys, all we gotta do is remember
to stay connected to one another

28:57.696 --> 29:03.452
and let anything we don't need
flow right through all the way to,

29:03.452 --> 29:05.913
I don't know, Germany or--
Where does it go, Ivor?

29:05.913 --> 29:08.832
Processed through a treatment plant
and dumped back into the ocean,

29:08.832 --> 29:11.251
where we swim and get our seafood.

29:13.253 --> 29:15.172
Oh. Okay. Yeah, that's horrible.

29:15.172 --> 29:16.757
- All right, y'all get it?
- Yes, Coach.

29:16.757 --> 29:18.717
Okay, let's get upstairs,
get some fresh air.

29:18.717 --> 29:20.260
Come on. Let's go. Hurry up. On the hop.

29:20.260 --> 29:22.763
No sudden movements near the bus driver.

29:29.561 --> 29:30.812
Coach Shelley,

29:30.812 --> 29:33.732
would you like to comment
on the new picture of AFC Richmond

29:33.732 --> 29:35.692
<i>that's just showed up online?</i>

29:35.692 --> 29:36.777
What picture?

29:41.823 --> 29:43.867
I think I know where the team's gone.

29:53.252 --> 29:54.711
Yeah, well, it makes sense to me.

29:54.711 --> 29:57.548
They probably have to train in a sewer
because their coach is so shitty.

30:06.098 --> 30:07.432
Oh, boy.

30:20.028 --> 30:21.488
I really like that Kenneth guy.

30:21.488 --> 30:24.032
He seems really plugged in, yeah?

30:24.032 --> 30:25.158
Oh, yeah. No, I agree.

30:25.158 --> 30:30.539
That nutter told me to ask the fucking
Earth to help me carry some of my burden.

30:31.874 --> 30:32.875
He ain't wrong.

30:32.875 --> 30:34.251
That's not a terrible idea.

30:37.296 --> 30:38.213
Oh, boy.

30:38.213 --> 30:39.298
What?

30:39.298 --> 30:40.632
That little prick.

30:40.632 --> 30:42.509
- Who?
- Just check your phone.

30:48.515 --> 30:49.975
Yo, you see what Nate said about us?

30:51.768 --> 30:53.061
Check this out. Look.

30:53.061 --> 30:54.521
- What happened?
- What?

30:54.521 --> 30:56.023
- You see?
- No, no, no.

30:57.649 --> 30:59.026
I better say something.

30:59.026 --> 31:01.320
Hey, hey, lads, lads, lads.

31:01.320 --> 31:05.782
Remember, it's just poopy. Let it flow.

31:05.782 --> 31:08.702
- Yeah.
- Just like in the sewer.

31:09.828 --> 31:10.996
Bingo, "el ringo".

31:10.996 --> 31:13.665
- Clever, Jamie.
- Yeah.

31:15.667 --> 31:16.877
All right.

31:25.511 --> 31:26.970
Hey, boss.

31:26.970 --> 31:28.055
Where were you this afternoon?

31:28.055 --> 31:30.849
I took the fellows
on a little impromptu field trip.

31:30.849 --> 31:34.102
Yes, to a sewer, Ted. I know.
Everyone knows.

31:35.062 --> 31:36.813
And you're upset that I didn't invite you?

31:36.813 --> 31:38.232
No, Coach Lasso,

31:38.232 --> 31:42.903
I'm upset because the team that I own
is projected to finish last this season.

31:42.903 --> 31:47.866
And my manager decided to skip training
and take our players into a fucking sewer.

31:49.284 --> 31:50.827
No, yeah, I can see your point, yeah.

31:51.578 --> 31:53.163
Did you hear what Nathan
was saying about you?

31:54.206 --> 31:56.792
- Yes, ma'am.
- And are you planning on addressing that?

31:57.417 --> 31:58.418
No, ma'am.

31:59.753 --> 32:01.922
Everyone is laughing at us, Ted.

32:02.673 --> 32:05.300
At you, at our team, at me.

32:06.343 --> 32:08.595
Rupert is laughing at me, Ted.

32:09.471 --> 32:15.102
And I am begging you, please, fight back.

32:20.148 --> 32:21.275
Yeah. Sarah.

32:21.275 --> 32:23.443
- Hey, I like the new hair color.
- Thank you.

32:23.443 --> 32:24.403
You do it just for fun

32:24.403 --> 32:26.071
- or are you going through a breakup?
- Both.

32:26.071 --> 32:27.573
Yep, no, I get it. What you got?

32:27.573 --> 32:30.242
Coach, how are you feeling
about the unanimous opinion

32:30.242 --> 32:32.828
that Richmond will be
relegated again at the end of the season?

32:33.453 --> 32:34.580
Yeah, that's true, isn't it?

32:34.580 --> 32:38.458
Expectations for us are as low
as a rattlesnake's belly button, huh?

32:39.042 --> 32:41.712
But, hey, we got 38 chances to prove
all them folks wrong though, right?

32:41.712 --> 32:44.756
Yeah. And my hopes are
as high as a giraffe's top hat.

32:44.756 --> 32:45.716
Next question.

32:45.716 --> 32:49.052
And if it is, "Why is a giraffe wearing
a top hat?" Don't ask me, man.

32:49.052 --> 32:50.804
Go ask a giraffe.

32:50.804 --> 32:52.764
- Coach?
- Yeah, Marcus.

32:52.764 --> 32:54.391
Marcus Adebayo, <i>The Independent.</i>

32:56.476 --> 32:57.561
Congrats on the new gig.

32:57.561 --> 32:59.563
- Thank you.
- What have you got for me?

32:59.563 --> 33:01.523
Do you have any response
to comments made earlier today

33:01.523 --> 33:03.734
by your former assistant coach,
Nathan Shelley?

33:08.989 --> 33:09.865
Yes, I do.

33:10.699 --> 33:11.742
Yeah.

33:12.618 --> 33:13.785
I thought it was hilarious.

33:16.914 --> 33:19.416
I mean, he came and got us, didn't he?
No doubt about that.

33:20.209 --> 33:21.877
Hey, but that's
Nate the Great for you, you know?

33:21.877 --> 33:23.045
He's the same way on the pitch.

33:23.045 --> 33:25.672
He'll find the tiniest
little weakness in a team

33:25.672 --> 33:28.342
and just want to attack that, you know?

33:28.342 --> 33:31.345
I mean, he's a junkyard dog, man.
And smart.

33:31.345 --> 33:33.430
They're real lucky to have him
over there at West Ham.

33:33.430 --> 33:34.681
I wish him the best of luck.

33:40.103 --> 33:42.773
I guess I am a little surprised
that's all he could come up with.

33:42.773 --> 33:44.066
Especially against me.

33:44.066 --> 33:46.443
You know, not one
joke about me being a dumb American?

33:46.443 --> 33:50.155
Come on, man. It's sitting there.
I mean, I'm so dumb...

33:54.576 --> 33:56.954
Y'all are supposed to say,
"How dumb are you?"

33:56.954 --> 33:58.914
- Gary.
- Why?

33:59.623 --> 34:01.250
Well, I mean,
it's just classic joke structure.

34:01.250 --> 34:03.627
Give it a shot. I mean, I'm so dumb...

34:04.419 --> 34:06.046
- Lloyd.
- How dumb are you?

34:07.756 --> 34:10.467
Okay. Well, I'm so dumb
that the first time I heard y'all

34:10.467 --> 34:11.635
talking about Yorkshire pudding,

34:11.635 --> 34:14.137
I thought it was a fancy word
y'all had for dog poop.

34:15.681 --> 34:17.391
Yeah. I mean, I'm so dumb...

34:17.391 --> 34:19.726
- How dumb are you?
- How-- How dumb are you?

34:20.351 --> 34:21.562
Yeah, all right, well, you know.

34:21.562 --> 34:26.233
Well, whenever I text someone over here
about money, I still spell "pounds" L-B-S.

34:27.900 --> 34:30.571
Look, man, I'm not a great coach.
Probably ain't.

34:30.571 --> 34:32.572
I've been doing
this sport now for three years,

34:32.572 --> 34:35.617
and I still get a chuckle every time
someone talks about a handball violation.

34:37.536 --> 34:40.664
Yeah, and not one crack about
my appearance? About this mustache?

34:40.664 --> 34:44.751
I look like Ned Flanders
is doing cosplay as Ned Flanders.

34:46.753 --> 34:49.715
<i>When I talk, it sounds like
Dr. Phil hasn't gone through puberty yet.</i>

34:52.384 --> 34:56.054
Yeah, I'm more corny
than Kevin Costner's outfield.

34:57.931 --> 35:00.142
I lost you on that one. Yeah.

35:00.142 --> 35:01.435
Swing and a miss.

35:01.435 --> 35:04.897
Yeah. <i>Field of Dreams</i>? No?

35:04.897 --> 35:07.107
I guess y'all
don't really like baseball here,

35:07.107 --> 35:09.318
so why would you like movies about it?
The...

35:12.321 --> 35:13.614
Well, hey, how about this one?

35:13.614 --> 35:15.240
Regarding my panic attacks,

35:15.240 --> 35:18.202
I've had more psychotic episodes
than <i>Twin Peaks</i>.

35:20.746 --> 35:22.039
I mean, I'm so crazy...

35:22.039 --> 35:24.291
- How crazy are you?
- How crazy are you?

35:24.291 --> 35:25.792
There we go.

36:01.203 --> 36:02.454
Coach Shelley?

36:03.664 --> 36:05.123
I have a package for you.

36:05.791 --> 36:06.792
Thank you.

36:10.087 --> 36:11.672
It's from Mr. Mannion.

36:20.514 --> 36:23.141
I don't know if I should open it
in front of you or wait for you to leave.

36:23.141 --> 36:24.476
It's a car.

37:19.448 --> 37:21.116
I'm finished, Uncle Roy.

37:30.167 --> 37:31.752
Ice cream before dinner?

37:32.336 --> 37:34.713
Either you think
I did something very good,

37:34.713 --> 37:36.798
or you guys did something very bad.

37:40.177 --> 37:45.224
Phoebs, your Uncle Roy
and I have something we need to tell you.

37:47.392 --> 37:48.894
Okay, what?

37:50.479 --> 37:52.189
- We're going on a break.
- We broke up.

37:57.319 --> 37:58.403
Which is it?

37:59.530 --> 38:01.281
- Well--
- We broke up.

38:04.785 --> 38:07.746
But don't worry, because your Uncle Roy
and I talked,

38:07.746 --> 38:11.124
and you and I can still see each other
whenever you want to.

38:12.334 --> 38:13.335
Why?

38:15.546 --> 38:18.632
Because we thought
you'd wanna hang out with me sometimes.

38:19.216 --> 38:22.344
No, no. Why are you breaking up?

38:28.725 --> 38:30.644
That's a good question.

38:36.650 --> 38:38.151
We're too busy.

38:39.820 --> 38:42.447
But you were both busy before.

38:44.700 --> 38:47.870
We're more busy now.

38:49.496 --> 38:50.998
How so?

38:52.791 --> 38:58.046
Keeley's got her own company now, so
that takes up a lot of her time and focus.

38:58.046 --> 39:00.174
And we had a coach quit,

39:00.174 --> 39:04.052
so it's now my responsibility for tactics
and strategies and shi--

39:04.052 --> 39:07.556
Roy, I know you're scared about that,
but it's gon--

39:13.145 --> 39:14.146
Right.

39:16.857 --> 39:19.067
Do you wanna talk about it some more, or...

39:19.735 --> 39:23.155
No, not really. It makes sense.

39:23.155 --> 39:25.949
I mean, you were only together a year.

39:26.700 --> 39:31.580
And few relationships can survive
a major career change, much less two.

39:34.374 --> 39:37.836
Besides, my mum and dad split up
when I were four,

39:37.836 --> 39:41.548
so one of my core beliefs
is that nothing lasts forever.

39:45.093 --> 39:47.763
I am happy
we still get to be friends though.

39:48.555 --> 39:49.848
Yeah, so am I.

39:52.267 --> 39:54.269
We should probably go.

39:54.269 --> 39:56.688
All that ice cream's already doing
a number on my tummy.

39:58.982 --> 39:59.983
Right.

40:08.033 --> 40:09.952
- Uncle Roy?
- Yeah?

40:10.619 --> 40:12.621
Are you sure you're doing the right thing?

40:16.124 --> 40:17.125
I don't know.

40:19.169 --> 40:20.963
Can I say a bad word?

40:20.963 --> 40:22.047
Go on.

40:22.548 --> 40:24.424
I think you're being stupid.

40:33.642 --> 40:35.018
Something on your mind, Coach?

40:38.438 --> 40:40.232
You ever wonder why we're here, Coach?

40:41.149 --> 40:42.401
In London or on Earth?

40:43.235 --> 40:46.446
Well, both, I guess, but for the sake of
this conversation, let's go with London.

40:46.446 --> 40:47.698
Carry on.

40:47.698 --> 40:50.284
I mean, look, I know it's nuts
we came here in the first place,

40:50.284 --> 40:52.703
but at this point,
I can't tell if it's more crazy

40:52.703 --> 40:54.872
or less crazy that we're still here.

40:56.582 --> 40:58.250
We grabbing a beer, Coach?

40:58.250 --> 41:00.961
No, I can't. I wanna talk to Henry. Why?

41:00.961 --> 41:03.088
'Cause we just passed your apartment.

41:03.088 --> 41:05.174
Shoot. Okay. Night, Coach.

41:05.174 --> 41:06.258
Night, Coach.

41:10.971 --> 41:11.805
<i>Hi, Dad.</i>

41:11.805 --> 41:15.017
Well, if it isn't
Mr. Carmen Sandiego himself.

41:15.726 --> 41:16.727
How was your flight?

41:16.727 --> 41:19.479
<i>It was good.
I watched a movie called</i> The Exorcist.

41:19.479 --> 41:21.023
Wait, you did what?

41:21.023 --> 41:22.191
<i>I'm kidding.</i>

41:23.901 --> 41:24.943
That was good. You got me.

41:26.153 --> 41:27.321
Hey, hey, check it out.

41:27.321 --> 41:28.697
I put the trophy you gave me

41:28.697 --> 41:31.658
right down here smack-dab
in the middle of Nelson Road Stadium.

41:31.658 --> 41:32.993
- How about that?
- <i>That's great,</i>

41:32.993 --> 41:35.662
<i>but why is Nate off to the side?</i>

41:36.413 --> 41:39.583
Well, remember, he's not
part of the team anymore, yeah?

41:39.583 --> 41:41.793
<i>Yeah, but you can still be friends, right?</i>

41:42.961 --> 41:44.630
You know what? You're right, buddy. Here.

41:44.630 --> 41:47.424
Yeah. All right.
Let me fix that for you right now.

41:48.675 --> 41:50.010
Yeah.

41:50.010 --> 41:51.303
There you go.

41:52.054 --> 41:53.180
Hey, big guy,

41:54.264 --> 41:55.933
you know I don't like being away
from you, right?

41:55.933 --> 41:57.226
<i>Yeah.</i>

41:57.226 --> 41:59.728
And that I'd only ever do it
for something really important.

41:59.728 --> 42:01.230
You know, something I believe in, yeah?

42:01.230 --> 42:02.272
<i>Yeah.</i>

42:02.272 --> 42:04.191
And do you understand why I'm still here?

42:04.191 --> 42:06.693
<i>Of course. To win the whole thing.</i>

42:07.945 --> 42:10.280
Well, now, don't forget.
Winning ain't everything.

42:10.906 --> 42:13.450
<i>Yeah, Dad, but you gotta try, right?</i>

42:16.703 --> 42:18.121
No, you're absolutely right.

42:18.997 --> 42:20.374
We always have to try.

42:20.374 --> 42:24.628
<i>Good. Now the universe is alive!</i>

42:25.379 --> 42:26.547
What is that?

42:26.547 --> 42:29.883
<i>Thanos's Infinity Gauntlet.
Jake gave it to me.</i>

42:29.883 --> 42:33.887
Oh, snap. Well, that is cool. Who's Jake?

42:34.388 --> 42:35.597
<i>Mommy's friend.</i>

42:38.225 --> 42:39.726
<i>See? It lights up.</i>

42:42.855 --> 42:43.856
Great.
