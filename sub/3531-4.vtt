WEBVTT

01:39.184 --> 01:40.727
What you doing?

01:43.104 --> 01:44.731
You fucked with us, Charlie.

01:44.814 --> 01:46.733
I did not, sir.

01:46.816 --> 01:48.693
Reggie Ledoux.

01:49.861 --> 01:51.905
I don't even wanna know that freak, man!

01:51.988 --> 01:54.616
Y'all didn't ask nothing about Reggie!

01:55.909 --> 01:57.327
Fuck, man. My...

01:57.410 --> 01:58.495
My wife just died.

01:58.578 --> 02:00.038
Ex-wife!

02:01.539 --> 02:04.501
You had Reggie Ledoux
take her out, didn't you?

02:05.126 --> 02:06.127
No.

02:06.211 --> 02:07.545
What are you talking about, man?

02:07.629 --> 02:10.048
Reggie? Put her out there
with them antlers on?

02:10.131 --> 02:11.382
You have Reggie do it?

02:11.466 --> 02:14.302
What are you talking about?
Reggie Ledoux did this?

02:14.385 --> 02:16.012
Reggie Ledoux.

02:16.304 --> 02:18.890
Reggie motherfucking Ledoux did this?

02:19.224 --> 02:22.811
Fucking shit! Let me out, man!
Let me out! Fuck, man!

02:22.894 --> 02:24.646
- Hey, Charlie.
- Motherfucking sick fuck!

02:24.729 --> 02:28.274
We're not gonna give you the Oscar,
no matter how hard you try.

02:28.358 --> 02:30.819
Fuck you, man! You don't know me!

02:30.944 --> 02:32.570
You don't know what I been through!

02:34.239 --> 02:36.616
What are you talking about? You talk to me!

02:36.699 --> 02:39.410
Ledoux knew about her, right?

02:40.870 --> 02:42.580
You talk about her to him?

02:42.664 --> 02:45.250
Yeah, man. Yeah!
The way you do sharing a house.

02:45.333 --> 02:48.503
Yeah, you talk pussy.
Talk scores. That's what you do.

02:48.920 --> 02:50.421
Showed him pictures of her?

02:50.630 --> 02:51.798
Yeah, I guess so. Yeah.

02:51.881 --> 02:54.300
I had stuff she gave me
when I first went down.

02:54.384 --> 02:55.927
Stuff for me to look at.

02:56.344 --> 02:58.346
You know, like Polaroids.

02:58.596 --> 02:59.889
He was a big guy.

03:00.640 --> 03:02.475
A lot bigger than you.

03:03.351 --> 03:05.270
Did you tell me you didn't get along?

03:05.353 --> 03:07.397
No. I mean, I did. Most part. You got to.

03:07.480 --> 03:09.858
You sharing a house, like I'm saying.

03:10.441 --> 03:13.611
I mean, he gets you high, man, but he's creep.
I ain't wanna know him.

03:13.736 --> 03:16.865
Tell me about Ledoux. How's he "creep"?

03:18.783 --> 03:20.785
He's a cook, you know. Like a chemist.

03:21.160 --> 03:25.707
Used to make shit out of kitchen stuff,
cook down cleansers and whatnot.

03:25.790 --> 03:28.877
Used tater skins and fry grease
to make hi-test sour mash.

03:28.960 --> 03:31.880
He got mad knowledge for that shit,
but I don't know, man.

03:31.963 --> 03:34.132
He talk like a short-eyes. Like somethin'.

03:34.340 --> 03:35.550
How you mean?

03:35.633 --> 03:37.510
He wouldn't talk that shit up in here.

03:37.594 --> 03:39.679
No, man, he didn't. Like, me and him at night.

03:39.762 --> 03:41.639
Blasted up on one of his mixes.

03:42.599 --> 03:45.685
He could brew some shit up,
put you up out your head, man.

03:45.768 --> 03:47.103
That's a big deal in here.

03:47.312 --> 03:49.522
Fuck, man, that's a big deal out there, too.

03:49.606 --> 03:50.815
So...

03:51.149 --> 03:52.942
What kinda shit was he talking?

03:54.986 --> 03:57.113
He said that there's this place down south

03:57.196 --> 04:00.283
where all these rich men
go to devil worship!

04:00.992 --> 04:02.493
He said that...

04:03.453 --> 04:05.914
They sacrifice kids and whatnot.

04:05.997 --> 04:09.667
Women and children
all got murdered there and...

04:10.001 --> 04:13.588
Something about some place called Carcosa
and the Yellow King.

04:14.339 --> 04:17.175
He said there's all these, like,
old stones out in the woods.

04:18.176 --> 04:20.094
People go to, like, worship.

04:21.471 --> 04:22.680
He said...

04:23.556 --> 04:26.392
He said there's just so much
good killing down there.

04:26.559 --> 04:29.646
Reggie got this brand
on his back, like in a spiral.

04:30.855 --> 04:32.523
He says that's their sign.

04:33.316 --> 04:36.444
What-the-fuck-ever, you understand?
I don't listen to the man, but he's big.

04:36.527 --> 04:38.905
So I don't tell him shut the fuck up, neither.

04:39.030 --> 04:41.366
You remember any buddies
he ever talked about?

04:42.200 --> 04:45.662
See, we checked the records here,
and he had never had any visitors.

04:46.537 --> 04:48.206
We both know Tyro Weems.

04:48.873 --> 04:51.209
Tyrone might could tell you where he's at.

04:53.378 --> 04:55.672
Look, man. Reggie is crazy. Like, for real.

05:05.390 --> 05:06.975
Had to be tough.

05:07.976 --> 05:11.521
Living with somebody spouting
insane shit in your ear.

05:12.230 --> 05:13.564
All day long.

05:13.731 --> 05:16.651
You gonna get me something
for what I told you just now?

05:16.734 --> 05:19.570
Parole board nod. Fair's fair.

05:29.080 --> 05:30.331
Hey. Hey!

05:33.167 --> 05:35.878
You think 'cause I talked to him
about Dori that

05:37.130 --> 05:38.840
I might have got her killed?

05:41.050 --> 05:43.094
You probably had something to do with it.

05:46.097 --> 05:49.017
I don't think you should have
shown him those pictures.

05:50.101 --> 05:51.185
Do you?

06:08.953 --> 06:11.873
We need to find this Tyrone Weems.

06:11.956 --> 06:14.042
See what he knows about Ledoux.

06:14.125 --> 06:15.209
Yeah.

06:19.964 --> 06:22.383
You didn't have to tell him it was his fault.

06:23.301 --> 06:25.136
Guy was already low.

06:25.678 --> 06:28.347
Yeah, he asked about his end first.

06:29.140 --> 06:30.641
Parole board.

06:31.809 --> 06:32.810
So?

06:33.978 --> 06:35.271
So, fuck him.

06:41.444 --> 06:42.820
You funny, Marty.

06:43.821 --> 06:45.656
The shit you get soft about.

06:47.116 --> 06:49.994
I wanted every member
of that family that I could find.

06:50.078 --> 06:51.370
Turns out,

06:52.038 --> 06:53.331
there weren't any.

06:53.998 --> 06:56.250
You know how weird that is in Louisiana?

06:57.752 --> 07:00.797
A cousin, Dewall,

07:01.005 --> 07:06.344
was not on paper,
except for a trucker's license.

07:07.220 --> 07:12.850
Ledoux had turned into a ghost
from the time he skipped parole check.

07:13.810 --> 07:16.687
Tell me, young studs,

07:17.438 --> 07:20.817
what would you do
when you hit a wall like that?

07:21.692 --> 07:25.613
Responding to the complaint,
I approached the house.

07:27.156 --> 07:30.034
Seeing that the screen door was broken

07:30.118 --> 07:33.704
and the inner door ajar,

07:33.788 --> 07:38.584
I felt that entrance complied
with standard procedure.

07:42.421 --> 07:44.215
Upon entering the domicile,

07:44.298 --> 07:46.467
I noticed what appeared to be marijuana

07:46.551 --> 07:50.680
and a white powder on the coffee table.

07:55.935 --> 07:57.228
Hey, Martin!

07:58.229 --> 08:00.815
- We don't have to talk, Lisa.
- Like hell we don't.

08:00.898 --> 08:03.442
You don't get to do
what you did to me last week.

08:03.526 --> 08:06.487
Look, I'm sorry. I was hurt and real drunk.

08:06.571 --> 08:07.822
Talk to me now.

08:09.365 --> 08:10.491
Okay.

08:10.575 --> 08:14.787
I wish you a great life,
and good luck with your new friend.

08:15.580 --> 08:17.331
You philandering fucking asshole.

08:17.415 --> 08:21.794
Hey! There is no pageant to perform. Okay?

08:21.878 --> 08:24.338
Your disappointment is irrelevant.

08:25.047 --> 08:26.966
You don't get to act like that, Marty.

08:27.049 --> 08:28.342
Or like this.

08:28.426 --> 08:30.011
I've acted as nice as I'm gonna,

08:30.094 --> 08:32.513
and I don't wanna
have this conversation again.

08:32.597 --> 08:34.557
You need to respect me, Marty.

08:35.183 --> 08:36.642
This is respect.

08:39.228 --> 08:41.689
Rust figured a connection
with an earlier death,

08:41.772 --> 08:44.650
suspicious, Rianne Olivier,

08:45.526 --> 08:49.989
led us to the DB's old boyfriend,
Reginald Ledoux, 35.

08:50.281 --> 08:54.660
Statch rape charge against a 12-year-old,
acquitted for lack of testimony.

08:54.744 --> 09:00.833
Did a bid for manufacturing meth and LSD,
which fits the tox screen for Lange.

09:00.917 --> 09:03.586
And his old cellmate
was Lange's ex-husband.

09:04.378 --> 09:07.089
He showed him
some cheesecake pictures of her.

09:07.548 --> 09:09.967
From what we know about him,
the way he talked,

09:10.051 --> 09:12.136
he sounds like he's real good for it.

09:12.803 --> 09:14.263
No line on any of his people.

09:14.347 --> 09:16.432
Swamp folk, dug in off the grid.

09:16.807 --> 09:19.852
We are tracking a KA, Tyrone Weems.

09:20.478 --> 09:22.563
He's in the sheets that we passed out.

09:22.855 --> 09:24.232
Any questions?

09:24.982 --> 09:26.234
I didn't think so.

09:26.317 --> 09:27.735
Let's get to work.

09:57.556 --> 10:00.226
You Theresa Weems? Tyrone Weems' mom?

10:01.185 --> 10:03.312
Tyrone hadn't been around in a while.

10:03.396 --> 10:04.730
You know, a few months.

10:04.814 --> 10:07.984
We got in a fight,
'cause he sold my microwave.

10:08.943 --> 10:12.280
What about his friends?
You know where they hang out?

10:12.697 --> 10:16.200
I don't know.
He dated this girl, Kelsey, for a little while.

10:16.784 --> 10:19.495
Kelsey,
when's the last time you saw Tyrone?

10:19.578 --> 10:22.081
Months. We been broke up.

10:22.581 --> 10:25.001
I don't ever hear from him. I don't want to.

10:25.084 --> 10:27.128
I heard he got Shawnda Miller pregnant.

10:27.211 --> 10:30.006
So, do you have his address, phone number?

10:31.299 --> 10:35.761
Look, I really wish I could help you,
but I can't. I have to get back to work.

11:01.162 --> 11:02.330
Hey!

11:03.331 --> 11:04.999
You know that gal back there?

11:05.082 --> 11:07.293
She got a man? Manager?

11:16.927 --> 11:19.055
Hey, do I gotta pull my badge?

11:19.138 --> 11:20.931
Hey, we run clean here.

11:24.018 --> 11:26.645
How you gonna run
when you're shut down six months

11:26.729 --> 11:27.938
for a grand jury inquiry?

11:29.273 --> 11:31.859
Why are you making me say this shit, man?

11:32.610 --> 11:34.445
Do you know her old man?

11:35.279 --> 11:37.531
Yeah, he came around collecting from her.

11:37.615 --> 11:40.284
Boss kicked him out
for trying to sell crys to the girls.

11:40.368 --> 11:41.952
That's about a month ago.

11:44.413 --> 11:46.457
- Look familiar?
- Yeah, that's him.

11:46.540 --> 11:49.168
- He ever pick her up?
- Yeah.

11:50.169 --> 11:52.213
<i>Went to work on Tyrone Weems.</i>

11:52.296 --> 11:53.964
Known associates, family.

11:54.673 --> 11:58.719
Had a little leeway with Quesada,
now that we had a suspect.

12:52.356 --> 12:53.482
Fuck!

12:53.983 --> 12:57.111
Fuck! Fuck! God damn it!

12:57.653 --> 12:59.155
- Lisa.
<i>- How does it feel?</i>

12:59.238 --> 13:01.574
<i>I told you, you can't treat people like this.</i>

13:01.699 --> 13:06.704
Listen, I just need to know
exactly what you told her.

13:06.787 --> 13:08.414
<i>You think it's okay what you do?</i>

13:08.497 --> 13:11.542
<i>All of you think it's okay
you treat your wives the way...</i>

13:11.625 --> 13:12.877
<i>You treat women the way...</i>

13:12.960 --> 13:16.130
<i>You're fucking liars and bullies
and this is what you get.</i>

13:16.213 --> 13:17.631
<i>This is what you get.</i>

13:17.715 --> 13:21.760
I have children. You blew up my life!

13:21.844 --> 13:23.345
You fucking whore!

13:23.429 --> 13:24.972
<i>What'd you just call me?</i>

13:25.055 --> 13:26.182
<i>What'd you just call me,</i>

13:26.265 --> 13:29.101
<i>you fucking wet-noodle,
whiskey-dick faggot fuck?</i>

13:29.185 --> 13:31.562
I will skull fuck you, you bitch!

13:37.318 --> 13:38.736
<i>Hello, Jake?</i>

13:40.529 --> 13:42.156
<i>- Jake, is this you?
- Marty.</i>

13:42.239 --> 13:43.282
Is Maggie there?

13:43.365 --> 13:45.826
<i>That's none of your goddamn business.</i>

13:45.910 --> 13:47.161
Jake, I know she's there.

13:47.244 --> 13:49.330
I know she's there. Put her on the phone.

13:49.413 --> 13:52.666
<i>I know what you did, Marty.
Leave her alone, you fucking asshole.</i>

13:53.334 --> 13:55.503
- Jake... I...
<i>- You're not hearing me.</i>

13:55.586 --> 13:56.962
I don't know what she told...

13:57.046 --> 13:58.005
<i>Leave her alone.</i>

13:58.088 --> 13:59.840
And I know we haven't always
seen eye to eye...

13:59.924 --> 14:01.675
<i>You're goddamn right
we've never seen eye to eye.</i>

14:01.759 --> 14:03.219
Just please, put her on the phone for me.

14:03.302 --> 14:04.845
<i>No. You're no damn good, Marty.</i>

14:04.929 --> 14:07.097
<i>She deserves better, and don't call here again.</i>

14:07.181 --> 14:08.641
Jake...

14:12.937 --> 14:15.064
How many exes you guys have?

14:17.358 --> 14:19.276
I mean, that's what I'm talking about.

14:19.401 --> 14:21.570
Did I make some mistakes?

14:21.654 --> 14:22.655
Yes.

14:22.947 --> 14:25.282
You know the detective's curse?

14:25.783 --> 14:27.535
Solution was right under my nose,

14:27.618 --> 14:30.079
but I was paying attention
to the wrong clues?

14:39.547 --> 14:41.131
- See you later.
- Bye.

17:19.748 --> 17:21.250
- Damn!
- Police.

17:22.000 --> 17:23.168
Fuck.

17:23.669 --> 17:25.671
Reggie Ledoux. Where is he? Now.

17:26.463 --> 17:27.881
That's what this is about?

17:27.965 --> 17:29.466
Man, why didn't you say so...

17:29.550 --> 17:31.260
Where the fuck is he?

17:31.343 --> 17:32.803
I heard he still cook.

17:32.886 --> 17:35.389
I heard he stopped selling after he did his bit.

17:35.472 --> 17:37.057
He only cook for one client now.

17:37.141 --> 17:38.308
Who?

17:38.892 --> 17:40.269
Some bike gang.

17:40.352 --> 17:43.147
They buy all his product.
Bulk order. No mess.

17:43.522 --> 17:45.274
I heard this at the clubs is all.

17:45.357 --> 17:47.192
Reggie don't distribute no more.

17:47.276 --> 17:48.485
Which bike club?

17:48.610 --> 17:51.238
Iron Heroes, or some shit.

17:52.948 --> 17:54.700
Iron Crusaders.

17:55.576 --> 17:58.120
I don't keep up with them gear heads.

18:01.165 --> 18:03.834
- Iron Crusaders. You sure?
- Yep. Them ones.

18:03.917 --> 18:05.127
What I heard,

18:05.794 --> 18:08.464
Reggie cook their loads, and that's all.

18:08.881 --> 18:12.342
Close your eyes and count to 100, if you can.

18:13.427 --> 18:14.511
Go.

18:14.595 --> 18:15.846
One.

18:16.013 --> 18:17.055
- Two.
- Louder!

18:17.139 --> 18:18.140
Three!

18:18.932 --> 18:19.933
Four!

18:20.684 --> 18:21.727
Five!

18:21.810 --> 18:25.898
<i>Listen, I talked
to Weems, and Ledoux is cooking</i>

18:26.023 --> 18:29.359
for some motorcycle gang out of Texas.

18:30.152 --> 18:31.695
<i>Iron Crusaders.</i>

18:31.862 --> 18:34.406
Iron Crusaders.

18:34.490 --> 18:36.200
You're sure he said Iron Crusaders?

18:36.283 --> 18:38.243
<i>I'm sure he said Iron Crusaders.</i>

18:38.535 --> 18:40.454
So, we'll...

18:41.038 --> 18:43.040
We'll chase that tomorrow, yeah?

18:43.123 --> 18:44.541
What are you doing right now?

18:44.625 --> 18:45.709
<i>Right now, I'm busy.</i>

18:53.467 --> 18:57.930
<i>Well, as I recall,
I had to take some personal time.</i>

18:59.348 --> 19:00.641
See my dad.

19:03.393 --> 19:06.480
I mean, this is, like, what?
Seventeen years ago?

19:08.232 --> 19:09.233
I mean, yeah.

19:09.358 --> 19:13.237
You're gonna have to understand
if my memory hadn't sharpened in the interim.

19:22.663 --> 19:24.414
- Fran, stay by the phone.
- I will.

19:24.915 --> 19:27.167
Maggie, can I talk to you for just a second?

19:27.251 --> 19:29.837
No. I'm working graveyard.
Girls are with my mom and dad.

19:29.920 --> 19:30.921
It's all in the note, Marty.

19:31.046 --> 19:32.673
Okay. But give me a chance to...

19:32.756 --> 19:35.259
She came to my home.
Our daughters saw her.

19:35.342 --> 19:39.304
You lying fuck. You stupid, lying fuck.

19:39.429 --> 19:42.224
Jesus Christ. Listen to me, Mags.

19:42.307 --> 19:44.476
I meant everything I said the other night.

19:44.560 --> 19:45.727
Every word.

19:45.811 --> 19:48.063
- I stopped...
- Oh, my God.

19:48.146 --> 19:50.983
You think your betrayal's
removed by its interruption?

19:51.066 --> 19:52.985
She was disgusting. You're disgusting.

19:53.068 --> 19:55.279
- You can't fix this.
- Listen to me. God, listen to me.

19:55.362 --> 19:56.822
Get your hands off me.

19:56.905 --> 19:58.699
Okay. I've been...

19:59.032 --> 20:01.285
I've been a mess. Rattled.

20:01.827 --> 20:02.828
My...

20:04.121 --> 20:06.373
- Just, my dad dying...
- Oh, my God.

20:06.456 --> 20:08.333
- That was a year ago.
- And drinking...

20:08.417 --> 20:10.919
I don't give a shit
about your goddamn feelings.

20:11.003 --> 20:12.588
You need to get out of our lives, Marty.

20:12.671 --> 20:15.173
Me and the girls. Read the note. It's all there.

20:15.257 --> 20:16.216
You can't come home.

20:16.300 --> 20:18.468
- You don't mean that. You don't mean that.
- Yes. Yes, I do.

20:18.552 --> 20:20.095
Listen, I...

20:21.305 --> 20:24.474
You are not gonna break up
my fucking family, okay?

20:24.558 --> 20:26.268
- Get out of here right now.
- No!

20:26.351 --> 20:28.604
Excuse me. You all right, Maggie?

20:28.687 --> 20:29.897
Sir, I suggest you leave.

20:29.980 --> 20:33.066
Everything's fine, Doc. I'm state police.

20:33.150 --> 20:34.318
I appreciate that,

20:34.401 --> 20:38.196
but are you here in that capacity now,
as law enforcement?

21:33.377 --> 21:34.628
You don't want to do this.

21:34.711 --> 21:36.463
Get your hands off me! God damn it!

21:36.546 --> 21:37.965
Call your commanding officer!

21:38.048 --> 21:39.466
You're making a scene, Marty!

21:39.549 --> 21:42.344
No. There is no scene unless
mall patrol here makes one.

21:42.427 --> 21:45.555
I am calmly discussing
a private matter with my wife.

21:46.765 --> 21:49.726
You're private in a pretty public way, man.
Easy. Easy.

21:49.810 --> 21:51.520
It's none of your fucking business.

21:51.603 --> 21:53.689
No, it's none of my business, but we got work.

21:54.356 --> 21:56.566
Marty, I got a line on Ledoux.

21:57.150 --> 22:00.529
I got it right fucking now. I need you.
Can we leave this shit until later?

22:03.490 --> 22:05.117
I love you, honey.

22:05.200 --> 22:06.576
I ain't giving up.

22:10.831 --> 22:12.082
Come on.

22:12.416 --> 22:14.251
<i>We can get to Ledoux.</i>

22:14.334 --> 22:16.086
All right? But it's gonna be dirty.

22:16.211 --> 22:19.256
I just need her to give me another shot.

22:20.257 --> 22:22.092
If I could just get another shot.

22:22.175 --> 22:24.177
Listen, can I tell you something?

22:25.262 --> 22:26.680
Yeah.

22:26.763 --> 22:29.683
This is none of my business.
I don't wanna hear it.

22:31.476 --> 22:33.103
Right. I'm sorry.

22:38.108 --> 22:39.735
You total shit.

22:40.610 --> 22:42.487
You know, this is part on you.

22:43.030 --> 22:46.283
You know, you can't just slide into
my life creating tensions...

22:46.366 --> 22:50.037
What, I make you tap some bimbo,
looks like a young Maggie?

22:50.120 --> 22:52.247
I make you flaunt that shit?

22:53.123 --> 22:56.960
Fuck, that night at the Longhorn,
you were so obvious, man, checking her out.

22:57.044 --> 22:59.921
And she looked crazy enough
to have followed you there.

23:00.005 --> 23:03.925
With all the dick swagger you roll,
you can't spot crazy pussy?

23:05.969 --> 23:07.220
I fucked up.

23:08.180 --> 23:09.306
Just...

23:11.141 --> 23:13.185
I like something wild. I always did.

23:13.268 --> 23:14.478
I just...

23:15.395 --> 23:19.149
It feels like it smoothes out
the other parts of my life...

23:19.232 --> 23:22.527
Listen, Marty. One more time.
It's none of my fucking business.

23:23.111 --> 23:24.279
Fuck.

23:24.362 --> 23:25.572
Look.

23:25.906 --> 23:27.491
We got a job to do.

23:27.824 --> 23:28.825
Off-book.

23:28.909 --> 23:30.577
It's the only play I can think of.

23:30.660 --> 23:34.414
I got to straighten out things with the family.
I gotta fix it.

23:34.498 --> 23:37.125
That bike club. I know 'em.

23:37.250 --> 23:39.461
Had deals with 'em when I was working narco.

23:39.544 --> 23:42.005
We can get to that motherfucker Ledoux.

23:43.381 --> 23:48.303
So, enough with the self-improvement,
penance, hand-wringing shit.

23:48.553 --> 23:50.889
- Let's go to work.
- You think you're...

23:54.142 --> 23:55.352
Fuck!

23:56.645 --> 23:58.688
Hell of a bedside manner you got, Rust.

23:58.814 --> 24:01.775
You know being stupid's
different than calling in sick,

24:01.858 --> 24:04.402
and this is a bar, not a fucking bedside.

24:04.861 --> 24:06.363
A friend in need.

24:08.323 --> 24:11.952
Every time I think you hit a ceiling,
you just keep raising the bar.

24:12.035 --> 24:15.122
You are like the Michael Jordan
of being a son of a bitch.

24:15.205 --> 24:16.206
That's it. Come on.

24:16.289 --> 24:19.000
You're really gonna love this jacket I got.

24:23.797 --> 24:25.215
Holy shit!

24:25.799 --> 24:27.300
You visit a lot of gun shows?

24:28.009 --> 24:31.888
No, it's just some stuff I kept
just in case some work came back on me.

24:35.016 --> 24:37.519
These boys Ledoux deals to,

24:38.436 --> 24:40.397
they're out of East Texas.

24:40.689 --> 24:43.150
I worked 'em when I was DEA task force.

24:46.236 --> 24:47.988
They know you're 5-0?

24:48.238 --> 24:49.364
Nope.

24:49.447 --> 24:52.576
I wasn't sure, so I checked
with my old handler.

24:53.493 --> 24:55.162
As far as my cover goes,

24:55.245 --> 24:59.499
I took three slugs in a DEA shoot-out
at the port of Houston.

25:00.417 --> 25:03.086
Anybody gives a shit, figures I'm dead.

25:04.296 --> 25:09.551
Major said the task force
used to call you Crash.

25:12.345 --> 25:15.015
I'm gonna have to take
some personal time on this, Marty.

25:15.098 --> 25:16.516
A couple of weeks.

25:16.600 --> 25:19.603
Got to get out there and get seen,
drop some lines.

25:20.103 --> 25:22.355
I mean, badges ain't gonna
get us near these people,

25:22.439 --> 25:24.941
so the plan is we make 'em an offer.

25:27.527 --> 25:30.697
Get a line on their supplier.
Confirm it's Ledoux.

25:30.989 --> 25:32.490
Bring him in.

25:34.242 --> 25:37.913
Then once we're out there,
all right, it's just you and me on this.

25:38.288 --> 25:40.790
I don't like that.

25:41.499 --> 25:43.627
What happens if they clock you're not you?

25:47.088 --> 25:50.592
No, I can't do what I need to do
if we got watchdogs.

25:51.259 --> 25:53.637
Besides, like you said, Quesada'd pull me.

25:54.137 --> 25:56.640
The stakes ain't that high anyway.

25:56.723 --> 25:58.850
I get found, I take a bullet to the head.

26:00.227 --> 26:02.562
This cartel I worked on the border,

26:02.646 --> 26:05.607
they had this routine.

26:07.317 --> 26:10.570
They'd duct tape you to a chair
that was bolted to the floor.

26:10.654 --> 26:12.530
Use a couple rolls,

26:12.614 --> 26:14.908
make sure you couldn't budge a fucking inch.

26:16.576 --> 26:19.162
And then, they'd cut around your face,

26:19.955 --> 26:21.998
grip your scalp, yank down.

26:22.999 --> 26:24.501
Rip your face off.

26:27.420 --> 26:30.632
Then they put a mirror in front of you,

26:31.091 --> 26:33.426
so you can get a good look at yourself.

26:35.387 --> 26:38.056
Then they cut your dick and your balls off,

26:41.518 --> 26:43.895
shove 'em down your throat

26:44.062 --> 26:47.732
until you bled and choked out
while you were watching.

26:53.154 --> 26:55.448
So, as far as high stakes go,

26:55.532 --> 26:57.367
bullet to the head,

26:57.450 --> 26:58.702
it ain't that.

26:59.995 --> 27:01.037
Hey.

27:03.290 --> 27:05.375
You sure you wanna do this?

27:06.376 --> 27:08.461
Not exactly.

27:30.108 --> 27:33.194
You realize you got
a upstairs here, right?

27:44.372 --> 27:45.832
What is that?

27:46.416 --> 27:48.126
Ink and cayenne.

27:49.336 --> 27:51.880
Irritates the skin, looks contused.

27:52.172 --> 27:55.342
How long did they have you out there,
working the corridor?

27:56.843 --> 27:59.137
- Almost four years.
- Four?

28:00.263 --> 28:01.598
What the hell.

28:01.973 --> 28:04.851
UCs ain't supposed
to do more than 11 months.

28:07.187 --> 28:09.522
Yeah, but I had fucked up on the job,

28:09.606 --> 28:12.650
and they could do
whatever they wanted with me.

28:14.611 --> 28:17.030
That's a long time being like that.

28:24.746 --> 28:28.041
I need a good story to move fast,
and I think I got one.

28:30.126 --> 28:32.337
All I need now is some good coke.

28:34.005 --> 28:35.673
Where you gonna get that?

28:37.967 --> 28:39.469
Don't worry about it.

28:42.389 --> 28:45.975
So you got a suspect,
and you take a leave of absence?

28:46.518 --> 28:47.560
Yep.

28:47.644 --> 28:49.479
Like I said, to see my pops.

28:51.314 --> 28:52.649
Had leukemia.

28:59.948 --> 29:01.241
Hey, Favre.

29:01.324 --> 29:03.076
Can I get the evidence key from you?

29:03.159 --> 29:04.327
Yeah.

29:04.411 --> 29:07.455
- Heard you were taking time.
- Yeah, leaving tonight.

29:07.914 --> 29:09.374
- Sign the log.
- Yep.

30:26.242 --> 30:28.578
You supposed to see both eyes in this one?

30:59.108 --> 31:02.111
They really should have
a better system for this.

31:02.612 --> 31:04.572
We looked at
your old partner's history.

31:04.656 --> 31:07.367
And coincidences keep mounting, Detective.

31:08.785 --> 31:10.870
Coincidences. Like what?

31:10.954 --> 31:13.748
Well, I don't know if
it would qualify as coincidence,

31:13.831 --> 31:16.584
but near as we can tell,
his pops never had leukemia.

31:16.668 --> 31:18.044
No hospital records of that.

31:18.127 --> 31:22.090
Fact, nobody in that town in Alaska
seen Travis Cohle in more than 30 years.

31:23.633 --> 31:24.759
That it?

31:25.385 --> 31:27.762
You still angry at him? Your pops?

31:27.845 --> 31:29.013
No.

31:29.764 --> 31:30.974
He's dead.

31:32.350 --> 31:33.351
You were, though?

31:33.810 --> 31:35.520
I mean, why you two didn't talk.

31:36.271 --> 31:38.189
We never really liked each other.

31:38.773 --> 31:40.567
There's a difference.

31:45.029 --> 31:46.573
He was in 'Nam.

31:46.823 --> 31:49.701
Met my mother on leave in Galveston.

31:49.826 --> 31:51.828
The time he came back, I was two.

31:51.911 --> 31:54.956
She dumped me on him, then she hauled ass,

31:55.039 --> 31:56.916
and he and I moved to Alaska.

31:57.166 --> 32:00.545
He was a survivalist, I guess you'd call it.

32:02.505 --> 32:04.882
Had some pretty fucking strange ideas.

32:09.512 --> 32:12.390
There's nothing like
the night sky out there, though.

32:14.976 --> 32:16.853
I couldn't handle the cold,

32:18.104 --> 32:19.814
so I headed back to South Texas,

32:19.897 --> 32:23.526
'cause all I could remember was
at least it never got cold.

32:26.446 --> 32:29.991
My old man always made
like I let him down that way.

32:33.077 --> 32:34.954
Said I had no loyalty.

32:38.333 --> 32:41.169
A clean break is best now,
while they're still young.

32:41.252 --> 32:43.671
Look, it's none of my business, okay.

32:43.755 --> 32:46.132
But I do need him to watch my back on this.

32:46.215 --> 32:47.759
This is how you all get warped.

32:48.801 --> 32:51.554
You always shortchange the wrong things.

32:52.263 --> 32:53.556
Shortchange.

32:54.182 --> 32:55.308
What else?

32:57.518 --> 33:00.855
He wanted me to pass a tide
of apologies of which I'll skip.

33:03.191 --> 33:06.569
And he wants to see the girls
if you can make time for it.

33:14.118 --> 33:16.704
Kids are the only thing that matter, Maggie.

33:17.914 --> 33:21.000
They're the only reason for
this whole man-woman drama.

33:21.918 --> 33:23.169
I'm sorry.

33:23.252 --> 33:25.129
What are you suggesting, exactly?

33:25.213 --> 33:27.090
Just that people fuck up.

33:29.175 --> 33:30.385
We age.

33:30.760 --> 33:34.847
Men, women, it's not supposed to work,
except to make kids.

33:36.724 --> 33:38.601
So if you could imagine

33:39.143 --> 33:41.688
Marty's behavior
as an expression of weakness,

33:42.980 --> 33:43.981
pain,

33:44.065 --> 33:46.484
you'd see that it's not about you.

33:46.609 --> 33:49.320
So, end of the day,
you duck under rationalization.

33:49.404 --> 33:51.155
Same as any of 'em.

33:52.448 --> 33:54.450
You must've been a great husband.

34:30.403 --> 34:33.656
People been seeing me around
for about a week.

34:33.740 --> 34:36.617
Guy I used to run with,
he wants to meet me tonight.

34:36.993 --> 34:40.329
<i>Now, if I can get him alone,
we snatch him up, work him over,</i>

34:40.413 --> 34:41.748
<i>maybe get to Ledoux.</i>

34:43.082 --> 34:45.084
- Okay. Great.
- All right.

34:45.835 --> 34:46.794
Listen...

34:46.878 --> 34:49.505
Phone's fully charged.
And remember, it's real simple.

34:49.589 --> 34:51.966
Green answers. Red hangs up.

34:52.049 --> 34:54.260
- I'm the only one that's gonna be calling.
- All right.

34:54.343 --> 34:55.970
- Keep it charged.
- Yeah.

35:00.391 --> 35:03.519
Listen, how was she? What'd she say?

35:05.772 --> 35:07.190
She was better.

35:07.815 --> 35:09.192
I could see her softening.

35:10.401 --> 35:12.069
She didn't use the "D" word.

35:12.153 --> 35:15.490
My eyes, I could see you two
back together within a couple months.

35:16.657 --> 35:17.992
That your honest read?

35:19.619 --> 35:21.078
That's my honest read, Marty.

35:45.436 --> 35:46.979
<i>Look, I don't know</i>

35:47.063 --> 35:49.565
<i>how this guy I'm meeting tonight
feels about me.</i>

35:49.649 --> 35:50.858
What does that mean?

35:51.025 --> 35:55.071
It means if you lose track of me tonight,
keep this fucker handy.

35:55.738 --> 35:58.115
And be listening
to Beaumont police channels.

35:58.199 --> 35:59.158
Yeah.

35:59.242 --> 36:00.993
- You got it?
- Yeah.

36:01.077 --> 36:02.787
- You got it.
- I got it.

36:02.870 --> 36:04.413
Are you gonna be all right?

36:43.286 --> 36:45.121
Crash here for Ginger.

37:15.902 --> 37:19.488
After Houston, I got to a doc in Eagle Pass.

37:20.823 --> 37:22.783
Coyote got me across the border.

37:23.951 --> 37:27.496
Past two years I've been working security
for a group in San Miguel.

37:30.166 --> 37:32.627
Feds never ID'd me, so I figured,

37:32.710 --> 37:35.796
"Hell, two years pass, things chill down."

37:36.339 --> 37:39.008
It was cool for me to come back,
stick my head out.

37:39.634 --> 37:41.010
It'll be tough, man,

37:42.595 --> 37:44.597
thinking you been dead this whole time.

37:45.014 --> 37:47.016
Fuck, I look dead, motherfucker?

37:48.559 --> 37:50.478
I'm looking to get with you.

37:51.020 --> 37:52.480
You or Miles.

37:53.606 --> 37:55.691
Miles ain't gonna wanna see you, Crash.

37:56.067 --> 37:57.693
I think he might.

37:58.653 --> 37:59.904
Then I'd say,

38:00.529 --> 38:02.448
I don't think you want to see Miles.

38:02.949 --> 38:05.451
Man, I ain't here to start a thing, all right.

38:06.243 --> 38:10.665
Boys I been running with in Mexico,
there could be a hell of a deal for both sides.

38:10.748 --> 38:12.333
Fucking money to be made.

38:12.416 --> 38:13.793
Real money.

38:15.211 --> 38:16.671
What kind of money?

38:23.469 --> 38:25.012
Goddamn, Rust.

38:26.013 --> 38:27.223
What the fuck?

38:57.086 --> 38:59.255
My boys are looking to trade, all right?

38:59.338 --> 39:00.756
Coke for meth.

39:09.265 --> 39:10.683
What you got there?

39:10.850 --> 39:12.351
This is something just for you.

39:12.435 --> 39:14.020
Something just for me?

39:15.646 --> 39:16.981
What'd you cut it with?

39:17.064 --> 39:18.107
You'll see.

39:18.524 --> 39:19.692
You dig it.

39:22.486 --> 39:24.739
After all I meant to you, huh?

39:35.332 --> 39:37.668
Now, who exactly are these guys?

39:43.799 --> 39:44.967
They...

39:46.302 --> 39:47.762
Ex-Mex army.

39:47.845 --> 39:50.264
They got a Colombian connection.

39:50.347 --> 39:53.017
They need meth for the maquiladoras.

39:54.477 --> 39:56.103
They could cook it themselves,

39:56.187 --> 39:58.147
but then the cartels would take notice,

39:58.230 --> 40:00.357
and that ain't what they're looking for.

40:05.988 --> 40:07.114
Here.

40:07.948 --> 40:09.366
Taste that, homie.

40:18.501 --> 40:21.337
- That ain't no fuck around shit.
- Goddamn.

40:30.346 --> 40:31.764
You keep it.

40:32.014 --> 40:35.476
I got bulldozers' worth of that shit
where I came from.

40:38.979 --> 40:40.231
The thing is,

40:41.857 --> 40:43.150
we got one cook.

40:44.026 --> 40:46.153
Does all our work exclusive, like.

40:47.029 --> 40:49.031
He's real specific about that.

40:49.365 --> 40:52.493
What's this worth to you, Crash?
Me selling Miles on this?

40:53.327 --> 40:55.371
I'll go you one better, brother.

40:57.248 --> 40:59.542
We don't take that shit to Miles at all.

41:00.251 --> 41:01.961
You and me work the supplier.

41:02.044 --> 41:04.463
The cut's whatever the fuck we want it to be.

41:04.547 --> 41:06.132
Now, that's tricky shit, bro.

41:06.215 --> 41:07.967
And I don't know you like I used to.

41:08.050 --> 41:10.010
I don't know you like I used to either.

41:10.094 --> 41:11.137
That's why the fuck I'm here.

41:11.220 --> 41:13.222
Well, let me tell you why I came, Crash.

41:13.305 --> 41:14.640
I need something from you.

41:14.723 --> 41:15.683
Tonight.

41:15.766 --> 41:20.062
I had a four-man team for a big grab
and lost one to smokies.

41:20.146 --> 41:21.689
I came looking to replace him.

41:21.772 --> 41:23.190
If you're still a badass.

41:23.274 --> 41:25.568
I don't do A and R, man. No fucking bank job.

41:25.651 --> 41:26.986
It ain't nothing like that.

41:27.069 --> 41:28.320
I need a good soldier.

41:28.404 --> 41:30.156
Now, you do this with us,

41:30.906 --> 41:33.200
we talk about putting you with my man.

41:33.409 --> 41:34.660
Look.

41:35.161 --> 41:37.371
I don't ride cowboy no more, Ginger.

41:37.454 --> 41:41.542
None of this small-time shit
like this thing you're talking about, all right?

41:42.293 --> 41:44.253
What, did you get neutered down south?

41:45.045 --> 41:47.047
I embrace the outlaw life.

41:48.549 --> 41:50.384
Now you dress the part, still.

41:52.303 --> 41:53.762
That's just an act?

41:54.597 --> 41:56.348
When in Rome, brother.

41:56.599 --> 41:59.101
But I do clean up real fucking pretty.

42:01.687 --> 42:03.522
Motherfucker, I need a gunslinger.

42:04.064 --> 42:06.775
Now, you ain't too timid,
get on this shit with me.

42:07.526 --> 42:09.987
Then we can talk about doing business.

42:14.158 --> 42:15.284
Where?

42:17.870 --> 42:18.954
My place.

42:22.249 --> 42:23.459
Down the bayou.

42:24.793 --> 42:26.212
All right, I got my truck.

42:26.587 --> 42:27.880
It'll be safe here.

42:33.135 --> 42:34.386
Members only.

42:34.470 --> 42:36.639
I'm just looking for a friend.

43:14.260 --> 43:15.678
Hey! What the fuck?

43:15.761 --> 43:17.346
Look, look, look. My buddy's in AA...

43:17.429 --> 43:18.555
But you ain't listening.

43:18.639 --> 43:19.807
And I'm his sponsor.

43:19.890 --> 43:21.767
I'm worried that he might
have started drinking again.

43:21.850 --> 43:25.604
You better worry we don't pull your head off
and shit down your neck!

43:25.688 --> 43:28.524
He's been 20 years sober!
Just give me one second!

43:35.406 --> 43:36.782
- What the hell?
- I'm leaving.

43:36.865 --> 43:40.869
A guy could just come in here and say,
"Looking for a fucking friend"!

43:44.415 --> 43:46.417
Get the fuck out of here!

43:47.293 --> 43:48.419
I'm leaving!

43:49.044 --> 43:50.045
Jesus Christ.

43:50.254 --> 43:51.547
Hey, motherfucker!

43:54.800 --> 43:56.135
That's good.

44:21.952 --> 44:23.329
Gotta piss, man!

44:23.412 --> 44:24.371
Fuck is that?

44:24.455 --> 44:26.498
That's Tigger the nigger.

44:26.582 --> 44:28.083
Name's Tiger Thomas.

44:28.917 --> 44:31.920
Dealer in them Hoston Projects.
You know them?

44:32.004 --> 44:34.673
It's like them bungalowed,
flat-like joints, right?

44:34.757 --> 44:35.799
Yeah.

44:36.550 --> 44:38.260
They keep a stash house there.

44:38.344 --> 44:40.429
Fucking suck a dick!

44:40.846 --> 44:43.349
Hey, why don't you shut the fuck up, nigger?

44:43.432 --> 44:44.475
Fuck you!

44:44.558 --> 44:48.604
So y'all gonna take
a stash house in coon country, huh?

44:48.771 --> 44:49.772
Four guys.

44:49.855 --> 44:52.941
How big's the projects, man?
Like square block-wise.

44:56.111 --> 44:57.946
Get the gear, Mitch.

45:01.617 --> 45:04.328
Wait till you see this. You're gonna love it.

45:15.964 --> 45:17.466
You're going in as cops, huh?

45:18.801 --> 45:19.927
Yeah.

45:20.636 --> 45:22.846
You know where the stash house is?

45:23.389 --> 45:25.182
Tiger's gonna take us there.

45:25.974 --> 45:27.976
You got an exit plan?

45:30.270 --> 45:31.480
Timetable?

45:32.272 --> 45:33.607
Real cops come, then what?

45:35.275 --> 45:37.653
And you say you're going in
in one fucking car?

45:38.987 --> 45:40.364
As far as I remember, man,

45:42.032 --> 45:43.242
place is blocked in.

45:43.325 --> 45:45.119
Now there's one way in, one way out.

45:45.202 --> 45:47.663
It could be fucking Mogadishu, man.

45:48.414 --> 45:51.667
We hit trouble, you just gonna
fuck it in the ass.

45:53.877 --> 45:57.297
You scoop out the soft brains inside the skull.

45:59.341 --> 46:01.093
So you have thought it out.

46:03.262 --> 46:04.263
My bad.

46:22.197 --> 46:26.452
I come through for you on this tonight,
I gotta know you're gonna hook me up.

46:26.618 --> 46:30.038
'Cause I got a real job
I was supposed to be doing.

46:32.082 --> 46:35.210
You got my word.
You back me on this, I back you.

46:47.431 --> 46:49.099
Fuck it. Let's go.

46:49.558 --> 46:51.268
Up and at 'em, eggplant!

46:54.813 --> 46:56.982
Motherfuckers. Fuck you!

46:57.065 --> 46:59.610
- Come on!
- Fuck you! I'll kill you motherfuckers!

47:02.821 --> 47:04.573
Y'all are dead!

47:06.366 --> 47:10.412
<i>Available cars,
possible 503 at the Sears lot in the mall.</i>

47:12.080 --> 47:14.333

<i>Copy that. 10-4, air three.</i>

47:44.863 --> 47:47.199
<i>I mean
you got two ways to look at it, Tiger.</i>

47:47.533 --> 47:49.535
You can die and lose your shit,

47:49.618 --> 47:51.286
or you could live

47:51.787 --> 47:53.872
and go make some more shit.

48:50.053 --> 48:51.763
Yo, get back
in your house now. Police.

48:51.847 --> 48:52.931
Sheriff's department!

48:53.015 --> 48:54.600
Get back in your house. Do it.

48:54.683 --> 48:56.018
There's nothing to see here.

48:56.685 --> 48:59.438
- You sorry son of a bitch.
- Get the fuck out of here.

48:59.521 --> 49:01.607
Bitches gonna die. You gonna die tonight.

49:01.690 --> 49:02.858
Drop these motherfuckers.

49:02.941 --> 49:04.234
What's up, man? What's this?

49:04.318 --> 49:05.777
- Drop 'em. Put it down!
- Lamar!

49:05.861 --> 49:08.280
- Sheriff's department.
- Freeze, motherfucker.

49:08.363 --> 49:10.949
Come on. Keep marching. Keep marching.

49:11.033 --> 49:12.951
Get up there, big boy. Get on the door.

49:13.035 --> 49:15.078
- Tell 'em to let us in.
- Get the fuck...

49:15.162 --> 49:16.121
Open the door, Lamar!

49:16.204 --> 49:17.205
Tell 'em who you are.

49:17.331 --> 49:19.416
Open the fucking door, Lamar! It's Tiger!

49:19.625 --> 49:20.667
Beat on it!

49:25.213 --> 49:27.299
Everybody down! Now!

49:27.382 --> 49:29.176
Sheriffs! Hands behind your head!

49:29.676 --> 49:31.637
- Get the fuck down!
- No!

49:33.305 --> 49:34.973
Turn that light off, bitch!

49:35.057 --> 49:36.266
Hey, sit the fuck down!

49:36.808 --> 49:38.935
- Where the fuck is it?
- Sit the fuck down!

49:39.019 --> 49:40.979
You guys
aren't talking, motherfuckers!

49:44.483 --> 49:45.901
Don't move.

49:46.109 --> 49:49.071
It ain't a 5-0, dog.
They don't even have license plates!

49:49.154 --> 49:50.155
Get everybody, man!

49:50.238 --> 49:51.907
Someone gonna get strapped, nigga!

49:56.578 --> 49:58.413
Get in the tub. That's it.

49:58.497 --> 50:00.624
You lay down. Don't you move.

50:03.669 --> 50:05.087
Get me outta here!

50:05.462 --> 50:06.755
Shut your fucking mouth!

50:07.422 --> 50:09.049
Up on the left, man! Right there.

50:09.132 --> 50:11.134
No, no, no. Ginger, no! Don't touch it.

50:11.218 --> 50:12.177
It's in there.

50:12.260 --> 50:14.012
You open it, motherfucker.

50:14.096 --> 50:15.889
I'll put something else in your face.

50:15.972 --> 50:17.557
Get your fucking ass over there!

50:17.641 --> 50:19.518
Start moving! Come on!

50:19.601 --> 50:21.978
Come out, motherfuckers,
we know you in there!

50:22.229 --> 50:24.690
You motherfucker, get that shit off of there!

50:24.773 --> 50:27.025
- Come on, hurry your ass up!
- Motherfucker.

50:27.109 --> 50:28.568
Watch your fucking mouth.

50:28.652 --> 50:30.278
All right, 30 seconds in and out.

50:30.362 --> 50:31.863
Thirty seconds in and out.

50:31.947 --> 50:33.407
Get that safe open!

50:33.532 --> 50:36.034
Watch it! Watch it!
I'll nuke you, motherfucker!

50:36.118 --> 50:37.577
Keep your fucking mouth shut.

50:39.746 --> 50:42.124
- Get the fuck off my dog!
- Take it easy!

50:42.499 --> 50:45.377
Easy. Let's get in
and get the fuck out, Ginger.

50:45.460 --> 50:46.878
Get that light outta my face.

50:46.962 --> 50:49.256
It's Christmastime, Crash! We got this shit!

50:49.339 --> 50:51.550
Easy. In and out, in and out, in and out.

50:51.633 --> 50:52.801
Somebody looking outside!
