WEBVTT

00:27.403 --> 00:28.569
Stay with us.

00:28.654 --> 00:30.196
Spend all day with us.

00:30.280 --> 00:32.490
There are two, you heard me,

00:33.075 --> 00:36.619
two of everything
in every Noah's Arcade.

00:36.829 --> 00:38.746
That means, two of Zantar,

00:39.206 --> 00:43.584
Bay Wolf, Ninja Commando,
Snake-azon, Psycho Chopper...

00:43.669 --> 00:45.461
It's really good seeing you, Benjamin.

00:45.546 --> 00:48.214
You haven't been into Shakey's
for so long.

00:48.298 --> 00:49.716
Well, I've been real busy.

00:49.800 --> 00:53.094
...it's two for you 'cause one won't do.

00:53.303 --> 00:56.055
All this week,
kids under six get every fifth...

00:56.140 --> 00:57.598
There's a new pet.

00:58.851 --> 01:00.977
Chia Pet, the pottery that grows.

01:01.770 --> 01:03.563
They are very fast.

01:04.772 --> 01:06.023
Simple. Plug it in,

01:06.108 --> 01:08.651
and insert the plug
from just about anything.

01:08.902 --> 01:09.902
Simple.

01:10.154 --> 01:12.989
Even for our customers
in Waukegan, Elgin and Aurora,

01:13.073 --> 01:14.699
we'll be there right on time.

01:14.783 --> 01:15.908
So call!

01:19.997 --> 01:21.914
Wayne's World, Wayne's World

01:21.999 --> 01:24.208
Party time, excellent

01:28.297 --> 01:29.714
-Okay.
-All right, excellent.

01:29.798 --> 01:31.257
Excellent, excellent.

01:31.341 --> 01:33.801
Okay, extreme close-up!

01:42.728 --> 01:44.771
-Excellent.
-Okay, excellent, extreme close-up.

01:44.855 --> 01:45.855
Okay, now is the time for

01:45.939 --> 01:48.941
Wayne's World Totally Amazing
Excellent Discoveries.

01:49.026 --> 01:50.777
Our guest is Ron Paxton.

01:50.861 --> 01:53.738
-Welcome to Wayne's World, Ron.
-Thanks, Wayne.

01:53.822 --> 01:56.991
Now, you're the inventor
of the Suck Kut, right?

01:57.075 --> 01:58.785
What exactly is a Suck Kut?

01:58.869 --> 02:01.704
The Suck Kut is a revolution
in home haircutting.

02:01.789 --> 02:05.291
Wow. What a totally amazing,
excellent discovery.

02:05.375 --> 02:06.542
Well, yes.

02:09.003 --> 02:10.086
Fireworks!

02:11.840 --> 02:15.092
Now, Ron, the question
that's on everybody's mind is,

02:15.177 --> 02:16.302
"How does it work?"

02:16.386 --> 02:19.096
I'm fully prepared
to give a complete demonstration.

02:19.223 --> 02:20.932
Okay, okay, Garth, just sit there,

02:21.016 --> 02:23.100
and he's gonna put that thing
on your melon, okay?

02:23.185 --> 02:26.103
Just a trim. Don't buzz me, all right?

02:31.109 --> 02:32.360
So, tell me, Ron,

02:32.444 --> 02:34.695
exactly how does the Suck Kut work?

02:34.780 --> 02:38.407
Well, as you can see, it sucks as it cuts.

02:39.409 --> 02:41.536
It certainly does suck.

02:44.414 --> 02:46.499
-What are we looking at?
-Wayne's World.

02:46.583 --> 02:48.417
These guys, they do their show
out of their basement.

02:53.507 --> 02:55.550
-People watch this?
-Yeah, lots.

02:55.717 --> 02:57.510
Turn it off, man! Turn it off!

02:57.594 --> 02:59.595
It's sucking my will to live!

02:59.763 --> 03:01.722
Oh, the humanity!

03:04.101 --> 03:05.852
-Will you hand me the telephone?
-Sure.

03:05.936 --> 03:07.603
Can I have a buzz? No!

03:08.105 --> 03:09.188
No, no.

03:09.273 --> 03:10.940
Russell, it's Benjamin.

03:11.024 --> 03:12.525
Are you watching TV?

03:12.609 --> 03:14.777
Listen, could you turn it to channel 10?

03:15.445 --> 03:17.363
I want you to find out
who these guys are

03:17.447 --> 03:19.448
and where they do their show.

03:19.533 --> 03:21.868
I think we've found something
that we can sell to Vanderhoff.

03:21.952 --> 03:23.911
-Take your Ritalin, okay?
-I don't have a buzz...

03:24.454 --> 03:26.414
-Okay? You're in a forest.
-Forest?

03:26.498 --> 03:28.374
You're in a forest with Heather Locklear.

03:28.458 --> 03:30.334
-With Heather?
-And you're very warm.

03:30.419 --> 03:31.419
-Yeah?
-Very...

03:31.503 --> 03:32.628
-Warm?
-...warm.

03:32.713 --> 03:34.630
These guys are so funny.

03:35.257 --> 03:36.966
Oh, they're obviously brilliant.

03:42.973 --> 03:47.101
Wow! What a totally amazing,
excellent discovery...not!

03:47.728 --> 03:49.186
Thanks, Ron.

03:49.771 --> 03:52.231
Okay, that's all the time
we have for this week.

03:52.316 --> 03:53.441
Until then, good night!

03:53.525 --> 03:55.401
-Party on, Wayne.
-Party on, Garth.

03:55.485 --> 03:57.403
It's Wayne's World, Wayne's World

03:57.487 --> 03:59.530
Party time, excellent

04:03.577 --> 04:05.912
And... We're clear!

04:05.996 --> 04:06.996
All right!

04:07.080 --> 04:08.247
-Excellent show.
-Excellent!

04:08.332 --> 04:09.332
Excellent.

04:09.625 --> 04:10.625
All right!

04:10.709 --> 04:11.751
-Excellent show.
-Excellent!

04:11.835 --> 04:12.835
Excellent!

04:12.920 --> 04:14.587
Let me bring you up to speed.

04:14.671 --> 04:16.380
My name is Wayne Campbell.

04:16.839 --> 04:19.175
I live in Aurora, Illinois,

04:19.259 --> 04:21.052
which is a suburb of Chicago.

04:21.136 --> 04:22.386
Excellent!

04:22.471 --> 04:24.680
I've had plenty of Joe jobs,

04:25.891 --> 04:27.642
nothing I'd call a career.

04:28.018 --> 04:29.393
Let me put it this way,

04:29.478 --> 04:33.189
I have an extensive collection
of name tags and hair nets.

04:37.319 --> 04:39.028
Okay, I still live with my parents,

04:39.112 --> 04:41.280
which I admit is both bogus and sad,

04:41.990 --> 04:44.742
but at least I've got
an amazing cable access show,

04:44.826 --> 04:46.911
and I still know how to party.

04:46.995 --> 04:48.371
But what I'd really love

04:48.455 --> 04:50.456
is to do Wayne's World for a living.

04:50.540 --> 04:51.791
It might happen.

04:51.875 --> 04:54.377
Yeah, and monkeys
might fly out of my butt.

04:55.671 --> 04:57.463
Ah, the Mirthmobile.

05:03.345 --> 05:05.763
This is my best friend Garth Algar.

05:06.056 --> 05:07.264
Hi.

05:08.058 --> 05:10.768
I think we'll go with a little
Bohemian Rhapsody, gentlemen.

05:10.852 --> 05:12.228
Good call.

05:19.236 --> 05:22.113
I see a little silhouette of a man

05:22.197 --> 05:23.698
Scaramouche, Scaramouche

05:23.782 --> 05:25.700
Will you do the fandango?

05:25.784 --> 05:27.284
Thunderbolt and lightning

05:27.369 --> 05:29.203
Very, very frightening me

05:29.287 --> 05:31.330
-Galileo
-Galileo

05:31.415 --> 05:32.540
-Galileo
-Galileo

05:32.624 --> 05:33.833
Galileo, Figaro

05:33.917 --> 05:35.835
Magnifico

05:35.919 --> 05:39.088
I'm just a poor boy, nobody loves me

05:39.172 --> 05:42.174
He's just a poor boy from a poor family

05:42.259 --> 05:45.052
Spare him his life from this monstrosity

05:45.762 --> 05:47.263
Whoa. It's Phil.

05:52.352 --> 05:54.562
Phil, what are you doing here?

05:54.646 --> 05:56.856
You're partied out, man, again.

05:56.940 --> 05:59.150
What if he honks in the car?

05:59.234 --> 06:01.777
I'm giving you a no-honk guarantee.

06:03.655 --> 06:04.780
Phil,

06:05.615 --> 06:07.450
if you're gonna spew,

06:07.993 --> 06:09.618
spew into this.

06:13.457 --> 06:16.250
Easy come, easy go
Will you let me go?

06:16.334 --> 06:17.501
Bismillah!

06:17.586 --> 06:20.171
-No, we will not let you go
-Let him go

06:20.255 --> 06:22.298
-Bismillah!
-We will not let you go

06:22.382 --> 06:23.382
Let him go

06:23.467 --> 06:25.468
-Bismillah
-We will not let you go

06:25.552 --> 06:27.094
-Let me go
-Will not let you go

06:27.179 --> 06:28.721
-Let me go
-Will not let you go

06:28.805 --> 06:31.140
Let me go

06:31.224 --> 06:33.517
No, no, no, no, no, no, no

06:33.602 --> 06:35.144
Oh, mama mia, mama mia

06:35.228 --> 06:36.687
Mama mia, let me go

06:36.772 --> 06:40.983
Beelzebub has a devil put aside for me

06:41.568 --> 06:42.902
For me

06:43.236 --> 06:45.071
For me

06:54.372 --> 06:58.834
So you think you can stone me
and spit in my eye

07:00.504 --> 07:04.882
So you think you can love me
and leave me to die

07:05.383 --> 07:06.884
Oh, baby

07:06.968 --> 07:10.346
-Garth, pull over.
-Oh! Oh, man, come on.

07:10.430 --> 07:11.806
Not again.

07:15.852 --> 07:17.937
He does this every Friday.

07:18.814 --> 07:21.065
Stop torturing yourself, man!

07:21.149 --> 07:22.817
You'll never afford it!

07:23.235 --> 07:25.069
Live in the now!

07:26.738 --> 07:28.364
It will be mine.

07:28.615 --> 07:31.534
Oh, yes, it will be mine.

07:39.251 --> 07:40.793
Oh, yeah

07:40.877 --> 07:42.545
Oh, yeah

07:50.887 --> 07:53.722
Nothing really matters

07:54.349 --> 07:56.767
Anyone can see

07:57.769 --> 08:00.437
Nothing really matters

08:01.982 --> 08:04.984
Nothing really matters

08:05.068 --> 08:07.528
to me

08:12.075 --> 08:14.994
Hey, Wayne's World!
Wayne's World! Party!

08:15.078 --> 08:16.162
Yeah!

08:18.248 --> 08:19.456
Excellent!

08:19.541 --> 08:20.875
Way to go!

08:21.418 --> 08:24.211
Looking good, Garth! Party on, Wayne!

08:29.009 --> 08:31.760
Hey, Campbell. Uno momento, fellows.

08:33.138 --> 08:34.929
Officer Koharski, how's it going?

08:35.015 --> 08:36.307
Fine.

08:36.683 --> 08:38.433
Say, I smell bacon.

08:38.559 --> 08:40.352
Does anyone else smell bacon?

08:40.437 --> 08:43.938
Yeah, I definitely smell
a pork product of some type.

08:44.024 --> 08:46.442
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
I know what you're doing, Campbell.

08:46.526 --> 08:49.778
Bacon, pig, oink-oink, police officer.

08:50.947 --> 08:53.532
I used to say that to cops
when I was your age.

08:53.617 --> 08:56.243
-Hey, what are you up to?
-Me?

08:56.328 --> 08:59.330
I just pulled over a tour bus
on its way to Chicago.

08:59.789 --> 09:02.875
We had a tip that there was
some drug smuggling going down.

09:02.959 --> 09:04.418
We searched the entire vehicle.

09:04.502 --> 09:07.880
It was clean, so we had to proceed
with the body cavity searches.

09:07.964 --> 09:09.173
No way.

09:09.257 --> 09:12.968
Way! I inspected 12 individuals myself,
inside and out.

09:18.475 --> 09:21.101
Okay, this guy needs coffee
and crullers, stat!

09:21.186 --> 09:23.562
We gotta get him to Rampart. Let's go!

09:26.733 --> 09:28.609
This is Stan Mikita's donuts.

09:28.693 --> 09:30.611
Excellent munchables.

09:32.405 --> 09:33.989
This is the manager, Glen.

09:34.074 --> 09:36.367
He's here 24 hours a day.

09:36.493 --> 09:38.160
I recommend the Sugar Pucks.

09:38.245 --> 09:40.537
They're excellent. Come on.

09:41.331 --> 09:44.541
I'd never done a crazy thing in my life
before that night.

09:44.709 --> 09:48.254
Why is it if a man kills
another man in battle, it's called heroic,

09:48.338 --> 09:51.215
yet if he kills a man in the heat
of passion, it's called murder?

09:51.299 --> 09:53.968
Hello! What do you think you're doing?

09:54.177 --> 09:56.345
Only me and Garth
get to talk to the camera.

09:56.429 --> 09:57.554
Come on.

09:59.474 --> 10:03.143
I don't really
have too much to say right now.

10:03.228 --> 10:04.603
What's that?

10:06.690 --> 10:08.774
Hi, Mr. Withers.
How's the amusement park going?

10:08.858 --> 10:10.359
Just great, Wayne.

10:12.487 --> 10:15.322
Four coffees and
a half dozen crullers, please.

10:15.407 --> 10:17.074
And one jelly donut.

10:19.828 --> 10:22.621
Hey, there's your girlfriend,
Garth. Yeah.

10:39.639 --> 10:40.639
Ow.

10:44.102 --> 10:46.562
Excuse me, I fell.

10:47.355 --> 10:50.524
Don't you guys ever get tired
of ordering the same thing?

10:50.608 --> 10:51.942
-No.
-No.

10:52.902 --> 10:54.862
Don't look. Stacy.

10:55.030 --> 10:56.196
Where?

10:57.282 --> 10:59.491
Oh, God. I made eye contact.

11:00.243 --> 11:02.244
Psycho hose beast.

11:07.625 --> 11:09.543
Happy anniversary, Wayne.

11:09.627 --> 11:11.503
Stacy, we broke up two months ago.

11:11.588 --> 11:13.297
Well, that doesn't mean
we can't still go out.

11:13.381 --> 11:14.798
Well, it does, actually.

11:14.883 --> 11:16.675
That's what breaking up is.

11:16.926 --> 11:19.136
Well, are you gonna go
to the Gasworks tonight?

11:19.220 --> 11:20.262
No.

11:20.347 --> 11:21.764
-No!
-No!

11:22.140 --> 11:23.849
Don't you wanna open your present?

11:23.933 --> 11:26.685
If it's a severed head,
I'm gonna be very upset.

11:27.187 --> 11:30.105
-Open it.
-Okay. Okay.

11:34.778 --> 11:37.196
-What is it?
-It's a gun rack.

11:37.280 --> 11:38.655
A gun rack?

11:38.948 --> 11:40.199
A gun rack.

11:40.450 --> 11:42.326
Yeah, great.

11:42.410 --> 11:44.203
I don't even own a gun,

11:44.287 --> 11:47.498
let alone many guns
that would necessitate an entire rack.

11:48.291 --> 11:51.043
What am I gonna do with a gun rack?

11:52.462 --> 11:54.254
You don't like it, fine.

11:55.632 --> 11:59.134
You know, Wayne, if you're not careful,
you're gonna lose me.

11:59.219 --> 12:01.178
I lost you two months ago.

12:01.346 --> 12:03.722
Are you mental? We broke up!

12:03.973 --> 12:05.516
Get the net!

12:23.493 --> 12:24.576
-Wayne!
-Hey!

12:24.661 --> 12:26.495
How you doing? Garth!

12:27.455 --> 12:29.832
Hey, Tiny, who's playing tonight?

12:29.999 --> 12:32.543
Jolly Green Giants, The Shitty Beatles.

12:32.627 --> 12:34.878
The Shitty Beatles. Are they any good?

12:35.046 --> 12:36.088
They suck.

12:36.172 --> 12:38.382
Then it's not just a clever name?

12:38.466 --> 12:39.508
Who else?

12:40.135 --> 12:42.136
Crucial Taunt,
and they're just finishing the set.

12:42.220 --> 12:43.595
I hear they can wail.

12:43.680 --> 12:45.347
You're right. Party on.

12:45.432 --> 12:46.682
-Party on.
-Yo!

12:46.808 --> 12:48.016
All right, Wayne, Garth.

12:50.437 --> 12:52.020
All right!

12:53.690 --> 12:55.190
Now, dig this, baby!

12:55.358 --> 12:56.942
You don't care for me

12:57.026 --> 12:58.986
I don't care about that

12:59.070 --> 13:00.446
This is the Gasworks,

13:00.530 --> 13:02.573
an excellent heavy metal bar.

13:02.657 --> 13:03.949
Always a babe fest.

13:04.033 --> 13:05.784
And they got a pool table, too.

13:05.869 --> 13:08.036
Let me stand next to your fire

13:08.997 --> 13:10.164
Party!

13:12.083 --> 13:14.001
Party! Excuse me.

13:14.085 --> 13:16.628
Let me stand next to your fire

13:16.713 --> 13:18.005
Let me stand

13:18.089 --> 13:19.631
Let me stand next to your fire

13:19.716 --> 13:21.508
Hey. Excuse me.

13:22.886 --> 13:24.553
Excuse me.

13:24.762 --> 13:27.055
-What?
-I'd like to get by now.

13:27.515 --> 13:30.100
Get out of my face, you little dweeb.

13:32.228 --> 13:33.228
Ow.

13:33.897 --> 13:36.482
I have only one itching desire

13:36.566 --> 13:38.984
Let me stand next to your fire

13:39.819 --> 13:42.070
Let me stand next to your fire

14:04.427 --> 14:05.969
You don't care for me

14:06.095 --> 14:07.763
I don't care about that

14:08.056 --> 14:11.141
You got a new fool
I like it like that

14:11.434 --> 14:13.936
I have only one burning desire

14:14.187 --> 14:16.772
Let me stand next to your fire

14:16.981 --> 14:18.106
Excuse me.

14:18.191 --> 14:20.442
Hey, let me stand next to your fire

14:20.527 --> 14:22.361
What do you want, you little dweeb?

14:22.445 --> 14:26.615
Oh, let me stand next to your fire

14:34.415 --> 14:35.374
Thank you.

14:35.458 --> 14:36.875
You say your mama ain't home

14:36.960 --> 14:38.418
It ain't my concern

14:38.503 --> 14:41.630
Just don't play with me
And you won't get burned

14:47.804 --> 14:49.888
She's a babe! Schwing!

14:58.606 --> 15:01.024
Yeah

15:37.520 --> 15:41.189
-Fight, fight, fight!
-Fight, fight, fight!

15:47.196 --> 15:48.196
Yeah!

15:51.284 --> 15:52.409
All right.

15:55.163 --> 15:56.872
I love this woman.

15:59.792 --> 16:01.793
Hey, Raymond,
club soda with a lime, please.

16:01.878 --> 16:04.004
And would you get me a towel?

16:04.088 --> 16:05.631
Wow, you really wail.

16:06.299 --> 16:07.341
Thanks.

16:07.675 --> 16:10.636
Hey, you're that "party time" guy on TV.
Wayne, right?

16:10.720 --> 16:13.263
-Yes, and you are?
-Cassandra.

16:13.348 --> 16:14.431
Cassandra.

16:14.724 --> 16:17.559
Rough night, huh?
Everybody's kung fu fighting.

16:20.021 --> 16:22.689
Yeah. Well, nice meeting you.

16:22.774 --> 16:25.025
Hey, hold on! Can I call you sometime?

16:25.109 --> 16:27.444
You got 5 bucks,
you can come to the rent party.

16:27.528 --> 16:28.820
It's at my loft.

16:28.905 --> 16:30.238
I'm there.

16:31.783 --> 16:35.160
I gotta go, the club owner's
trying to dick me out of some money.

16:35.244 --> 16:37.996
Okay, okay, okay.

16:38.331 --> 16:40.457
See how many people I brought in here?

16:40.541 --> 16:42.250
That bass player's a babe.

16:43.002 --> 16:45.212
She makes me feel kind of funny,

16:45.588 --> 16:48.423
like when we used to
climb the rope in gym class.

16:49.175 --> 16:51.093
You said I'd get cash up front.

16:51.844 --> 16:53.220
She will be mine.

16:53.930 --> 16:56.640
Oh, yes. She will be mine.

17:09.278 --> 17:12.196
Pardon me.
Do you have any Grey Poupon?

17:35.096 --> 17:36.221
Okay, Garth, just sit there, all right?

17:36.305 --> 17:38.098
He's gonna put that thing
on your melon.

17:38.182 --> 17:41.935
Oh, okay, but just a trim.
Don't buzz me, all right?

17:47.692 --> 17:49.568
-Oh, no!
-Help me, Ron.

17:49.652 --> 17:51.278
Russell, stop the tape.

17:52.697 --> 17:54.489
So, what do you think?

17:55.032 --> 17:57.993
I think it's two chimps
on a davenport in a basement.

17:58.411 --> 17:59.995
I'm not sponsoring this.

18:00.079 --> 18:02.998
I got spots on Love Boat, but this?
What is this?

18:03.249 --> 18:05.917
Mr. Vanderhoff, this is your audience.
I mean, look at them.

18:06.002 --> 18:08.462
They're the same kids that line up
at Noah's Arcade every weekend.

18:08.546 --> 18:09.838
Well, it looks so cheesy.

18:09.922 --> 18:11.256
That would be where I come in.

18:11.340 --> 18:12.758
Russell's our best producer.

18:12.842 --> 18:15.385
He does Chicago PM,
with Elaine Ronkey,

18:15.470 --> 18:18.764
Sunshine Saturday,
the African American Digest.

18:18.848 --> 18:20.766
-I never heard of that one.
-It's on very late.

18:20.850 --> 18:22.267
It won several awards.

18:22.351 --> 18:24.269
Yeah, well,
I think I'll stick with Love Boat.

18:24.353 --> 18:28.356
If I may, speaking from
a producer/director standpoint,

18:29.066 --> 18:30.901
kids can relate to this show.

18:31.027 --> 18:33.069
These guys aren't phonies.

18:33.154 --> 18:35.447
Kids can spot phonies.
They're very smart.

18:35.531 --> 18:36.823
Kids know dick.

18:36.908 --> 18:38.700
I watch them in my arcades.

18:38.785 --> 18:42.829
They stand like laboratory rats hitting
the feeder bar to get a food pellet.

18:42.997 --> 18:47.250
But as long as they keep pumping in
the quarters, who gives a shit, right?

18:47.376 --> 18:48.710
Let me ask you something.

18:48.795 --> 18:52.506
What is your single biggest problem
in the arcade business?

18:52.673 --> 18:56.718
Well, keeping the customer
informed of new product.

18:57.386 --> 18:59.304
Like, we have a new game
called Zantar.

18:59.388 --> 19:03.308
Zantar is a gelatinous cube
that eats warriors in a medieval village,

19:03.392 --> 19:06.394
and every time it eats a chieftain,
you ascend to a higher level.

19:06.479 --> 19:08.563
Beauty part is,
you can't get to the next level,

19:08.648 --> 19:11.733
so the kids keep
coughing up quarters, you know.

19:12.568 --> 19:14.319
Gelatinous cube eats village.

19:14.403 --> 19:15.779
I think it's terrific.

19:15.863 --> 19:17.364
You know, I know nothing
about video games.

19:17.448 --> 19:19.157
I found what you just said riveting.

19:19.242 --> 19:22.035
-Well, I do my own commercials.
-I did not know that.

19:22.119 --> 19:24.371
Of course, I don't mention the games
in the commercials,

19:24.455 --> 19:27.666
because the technology moves
so much faster than the advertising.

19:27.750 --> 19:30.252
I did not realize that.
Russell, did you realize that?

19:30.336 --> 19:32.462
No, I did not realize that.

19:32.797 --> 19:36.216
So, Mr. Vanderhoff,
let me see if I'm hearing you correctly.

19:36.425 --> 19:40.428
Are you saying that if you had a spot,
say on a weekly show,

19:40.513 --> 19:43.431
that you could come on the show
and update the kids

19:43.516 --> 19:46.309
on exactly what was new
in your arcade?

19:47.270 --> 19:49.604
-Yeah, that's it.
-Well, I'm impressed.

19:50.106 --> 19:51.147
Wow.

19:52.608 --> 19:55.068
Noah's Arcade presents
Wayne's World.

19:55.152 --> 19:56.820
I've gotta tell you, I think that's brilliant.

19:56.904 --> 19:58.280
Brilliant.

19:58.781 --> 19:59.906
Well, thank you.

19:59.991 --> 20:01.408
We'll get right to work on this.

20:01.492 --> 20:03.243
We'll send the contracts
over to your office.

20:03.327 --> 20:05.078
We'll be in touch.

20:07.748 --> 20:10.417
-I'd like to think about this.
-Oh, of course you would.

20:10.501 --> 20:13.169
-I wouldn't have it any other way.
-Yeah.

20:15.131 --> 20:17.591
-She'll validate you.
-Thank you.

20:20.636 --> 20:21.803
He's in.

20:24.557 --> 20:28.476
-You've gotta get on it, right away.
-This morning.

20:29.312 --> 20:31.396
Stop it, you're scaring me.

20:32.607 --> 20:35.191
Oh, cool.
You're learning Cassandra's language.

20:35.276 --> 20:38.528
I've never seen you
so mental over a girl before.

20:39.238 --> 20:41.489
-Are you gonna marry her?
-Garth,

20:41.574 --> 20:44.743
marriage is punishment for shoplifting
in some countries.

20:44.827 --> 20:47.037
Okay, passed inspection.

20:47.121 --> 20:49.289
-All right.
-Just barely.

20:49.498 --> 20:53.001
Okay, that's $42.57, Wayne,
parts and labor.

20:53.085 --> 20:55.462
-No way.
-Brutal.

20:55.546 --> 20:57.047
-Okay. There you go.
-We got it.

20:57.298 --> 20:59.007
-All right, we got it, we got it.
-That's not enough.

20:59.091 --> 21:01.009
-What?
-We got that.

21:01.093 --> 21:02.928
-We got that.
-That's good, but I need more.

21:03.012 --> 21:05.472
Oh, man, why...
Why don't you use a gun?

21:05.556 --> 21:07.307
It's not my fault, come on.

21:07.391 --> 21:09.351
I suppose it's society's fault?

21:09.435 --> 21:10.518
More.

21:13.356 --> 21:14.731
-Cool.
-All right.

21:15.483 --> 21:17.359
Well, here's an extra dollar.

21:19.904 --> 21:21.988
You guys should have been
at Gasworks on Friday.

21:22.073 --> 21:23.114
Yeah, we were there.

21:23.199 --> 21:25.450
There was this band, Crucial Taunt.

21:25.534 --> 21:28.328
They had this mega babe
for a lead singer. Unreal!

21:28.412 --> 21:29.913
Phil, we were there.

21:30.164 --> 21:32.332
Have you gone mental? Hello.

21:32.667 --> 21:35.293
-I think we should go now.
-Here you go.

21:35.378 --> 21:36.544
-Cool.
-Cool.

21:52.228 --> 21:54.938
You think it's wise
to sell a show we don't own?

21:56.232 --> 21:58.066
By tonight, we will.

22:05.741 --> 22:07.158
Excuse me.

22:07.243 --> 22:10.161
Do you know where we could find
Wayne Campbell?

22:10.246 --> 22:11.496
That would be privileged information.

22:11.580 --> 22:13.498
We just wanna know
where they broadcast from.

22:13.582 --> 22:15.709
Are you a friend or a relative?

22:15.793 --> 22:17.127
We're neither.

22:19.130 --> 22:22.340
You know, Russell,
I may not have grown up around here,

22:22.758 --> 22:25.051
but I understand these people.

22:26.262 --> 22:28.263
This must be the place.

22:31.767 --> 22:33.560
Okay, we're just about
out of time, right?

22:33.644 --> 22:35.812
But before we go,
we'd like to take a moment here

22:35.896 --> 22:37.188
for a Wayne's World salute

22:37.273 --> 22:39.691
to the Guess jeans girl,
Claudia Schiffer.

22:39.775 --> 22:41.776
-Schwing!
-Schwing!

22:42.069 --> 22:44.029
Tent pole! She's a babe.

22:44.113 --> 22:46.072
She's magically babe-licious.

22:46.157 --> 22:49.284
She tested very high
on the strokability scale.

22:52.121 --> 22:53.621
-Okay.
-Hey, are you through yet?

22:53.706 --> 22:55.457
'Cause I'm getting tired of holding this.

22:55.541 --> 22:57.542
Yeah, that's what she said.

23:00.087 --> 23:03.631
Okay, so, Claudia Schiffer,
we salute you.

23:03.716 --> 23:05.633
-Scha-wing!
-Scha-wing!

23:05.718 --> 23:07.719
Okay. That's all the time
we have for this week.

23:07.803 --> 23:08.928
Until then, good night.

23:09.013 --> 23:10.722
-Party on, Wayne.
-Party on, Garth.

23:10.806 --> 23:13.016
Wayne's World, Wayne's World

23:13.100 --> 23:15.268
Party time, excellent

23:19.648 --> 23:21.191
And...we're clear.

23:21.275 --> 23:23.109
-All right!
-Okay! Excellent show, everyone.

23:23.194 --> 23:24.819
-All right. Excellent.
-All right.

23:25.321 --> 23:26.446
Great show.

23:26.781 --> 23:28.698
Wayne, Benjamin Kane,

23:28.783 --> 23:30.867
Regional Program Director
for Oliver Communications.

23:30.951 --> 23:31.951
-Oh, hello.
-Hi.

23:32.036 --> 23:34.913
And I'm Russell Finley.
We spoke earlier today. Hi.

23:35.206 --> 23:37.791
Listen, maybe we can go somewhere
and get acquainted.

23:37.875 --> 23:40.043
Russell, why don't you
get to know the crew?

23:40.127 --> 23:41.711
-You know anywhere nice?
-Hi.

23:41.796 --> 23:43.755
-See you guys later.
-Hi.

23:47.259 --> 23:49.844
First of all,
let me get this out of the way.

23:49.970 --> 23:52.055
-I'm a big fan.
-You are?

23:52.681 --> 23:56.309
The way I see it,
your show is capable of so much more.

23:56.393 --> 23:58.394
Well, we'll try harder, okay?

23:58.479 --> 24:00.063
Just give us a second chance.

24:00.147 --> 24:02.315
Just don't come in and cancel us
without giving us a second chance.

24:02.399 --> 24:05.360
Garth, come on, relax, all right?
Your pills?

24:05.569 --> 24:08.696
He can't cancel us.
We're on public access.

24:08.781 --> 24:09.989
Can I be honest with you?

24:10.074 --> 24:12.200
My job, it's usually such a bore,

24:12.284 --> 24:15.161
but the other day,
the most incredible thing happened.

24:15.246 --> 24:17.330
-What happened?
-Noah Vanderhoff,

24:17.414 --> 24:21.167
the owner of the largest chain of video
arcades in Chicago, is in my office,

24:21.252 --> 24:24.462
and he asks me,
"What's with this show, Wayne's World,

24:24.547 --> 24:26.172
"that I keep hearing so much about?"

24:26.257 --> 24:28.383
Well, I have all your shows on tape.

24:28.467 --> 24:30.093
Like I said, I'm a fan.

24:30.427 --> 24:31.678
I put a show in for him,

24:31.762 --> 24:33.930
and he literally jumped out of his seat.

24:34.014 --> 24:35.014
-Cool.
-Cool.

24:35.099 --> 24:37.225
Immediately,
he wants to sponsor the show,

24:37.309 --> 24:38.726
put you on our station,

24:38.811 --> 24:41.271
and pay you guys a huge salary.

24:41.355 --> 24:43.356
Of course, what he doesn't realize
is that you're both artists

24:43.440 --> 24:44.816
and that you're not interested in money.

24:44.900 --> 24:46.985
No, we're not interested in money.

24:47.069 --> 24:48.194
That's what I told him.

24:48.279 --> 24:49.988
But he said, "Go to Aurora anyway,

24:50.072 --> 24:53.992
"and take two cashier's checks with you,
so they at least know that I'm serious."

24:54.076 --> 24:55.994
I know that I may be wasting my time,

24:56.078 --> 24:58.163
but here I am with the contract

24:58.247 --> 24:59.956
and two cashier's checks

25:00.040 --> 25:03.084
for $5,000 each.

25:03.586 --> 25:05.879
Ex-squeeze me? Baking powder?

25:06.297 --> 25:09.090
It sounded like you said you were gonna
pay us for doing Wayne's World.

25:09.175 --> 25:12.802
I know. You just give me the word
and I'll tear up these checks right here.

25:12.887 --> 25:14.262
No! No! No! No!

25:15.681 --> 25:17.307
He shoots, he scores!

25:18.851 --> 25:21.519
Well. Would you like to
look at the contracts?

25:21.604 --> 25:23.146
-Yes.
-Do you have a lawyer?

25:23.230 --> 25:24.981
Yes. No.

25:25.065 --> 25:27.025
We're between lawyers right now.

25:27.109 --> 25:29.861
You see, our first lawyer
screwed our affairs so badly...

25:29.945 --> 25:33.781
That's right. I walked right into
that office, that's what I did,

25:33.866 --> 25:36.367
and I reached across that desk,
and I grabbed him by his big fat head,

25:36.452 --> 25:40.663
and I said, "Listen, man,
I'm not going to jail for you or anybody."

25:40.748 --> 25:41.915
Exactly.

25:43.918 --> 25:48.213
Can I have an opportunity to peruse
that contract before we sign it?

25:51.884 --> 25:53.092
Yes.

25:53.886 --> 25:55.136
Yes.

25:55.721 --> 25:57.931
I like what you've done here.

25:59.642 --> 26:02.185
Yes. Yes.

26:02.269 --> 26:03.811
I dropped my pen.

26:04.146 --> 26:05.813
I'm not so sure about...

26:06.774 --> 26:08.524
Oh, I see. I see.

26:08.609 --> 26:11.277
Hi. Does this seem weird?

26:11.362 --> 26:13.238
I mean, why does
this guy have contracts?

26:13.322 --> 26:15.782
Did you ever see The Twilight Zone
where the guy signed a contract,

26:15.866 --> 26:18.868
and they cut out his tongue, and they
put it in a jar, and it wouldn't die?

26:18.953 --> 26:22.747
It just grew and pulsated
and gave birth to baby tongues.

26:22.831 --> 26:25.500
Pretty cool, huh? I gotta go.

26:25.668 --> 26:27.627
Oh, I like this part.

26:28.504 --> 26:31.714
Well, I feel we can work with you
on this project.

26:32.007 --> 26:35.093
Well, you've made Mr. Vanderhoff
a very happy man.

26:37.596 --> 26:38.972
To Wayne's World.

26:39.348 --> 26:41.683
-To Wayne's World.
-To Wayne's World.

26:42.268 --> 26:46.020
We got $5,000, we got $5,000

26:46.105 --> 26:49.357
We got $5,000, we got $5,000

26:49.441 --> 26:51.693
Hey, check it out. Hey, Wayne.

26:52.027 --> 26:55.697
We got $5,000, we got $5,000

27:02.371 --> 27:04.956
Ain't got no reason

27:05.040 --> 27:07.292
For reaction

27:07.376 --> 27:08.835
Party!

27:10.087 --> 27:13.631
Ain't got no reason for distraction

27:13.716 --> 27:15.842
Great party, huh, guys?

27:18.053 --> 27:21.347
Love the way that you love me, baby

27:21.724 --> 27:25.310
Love the way that you stare

27:26.145 --> 27:27.729
Stacy alert!

27:29.189 --> 27:32.400
We've been spotted, and we're being
pulled in by her tractor beam.

27:32.735 --> 27:35.111
-I gotta go.
-We gotta go.

27:35.821 --> 27:38.698
Ooh, if you dare

27:41.327 --> 27:44.078
Don't be afraid to love me

27:44.288 --> 27:46.205
Anywhere

27:56.633 --> 27:59.886
Don't be afraid to love me

27:59.970 --> 28:02.513
Anywhere

28:03.307 --> 28:06.809
Won't you touch me?

28:07.394 --> 28:10.271
Won't you love me?

28:12.232 --> 28:13.691
Just let me know

28:13.776 --> 28:16.361
God, she's amazing. Yeah.

28:16.445 --> 28:18.363
I'll be there

28:18.447 --> 28:21.991
Wayne, Wayne,
Garth told me about the show, man.

28:22.326 --> 28:24.243
I love you, man.

28:24.703 --> 28:26.746
Yeah, and I love you, too, Terry.

28:26.830 --> 28:29.832
No, no, no, I mean it, man. I love you.

28:29.917 --> 28:32.627
No, I mean it. I love you.

28:32.711 --> 28:34.629
No, you don't, man.

28:34.713 --> 28:37.757
Why don't you love me?

28:38.175 --> 28:39.884
Garth, hey, come over here.

28:39.968 --> 28:42.470
I think Terry has something
he wants to say to you.

28:42.721 --> 28:44.806
I love you, man.

28:45.140 --> 28:46.349
Thank you.

28:51.146 --> 28:53.564
I'll be there

28:54.316 --> 29:01.114
Oh, I'll be there

29:22.428 --> 29:24.720
Your vocals are incredible.

29:25.097 --> 29:26.222
Thanks.

29:27.015 --> 29:29.016
You have a very interesting look.

29:29.518 --> 29:30.643
Aha.

29:31.019 --> 29:33.312
Oh, I'm not trying to pick up on you.

29:33.564 --> 29:34.689
Good thing.

29:34.773 --> 29:36.732
No, no, I'm producing a television show.

29:36.817 --> 29:38.734
It's in Chicago, very late night,

29:38.819 --> 29:40.445
but we're looking for a musical act.

29:40.529 --> 29:44.240
Here's my card. Is there a number
where I can reach you at?

29:44.825 --> 29:46.993
We got fliers at the door.

29:52.833 --> 29:54.041
Hello.

30:04.386 --> 30:07.889
Wayne? Hi, Wayne. Hi.

30:16.064 --> 30:18.691
Hi, you wanna go somewhere and talk?

30:18.775 --> 30:20.026
Sure.

30:29.411 --> 30:31.162
What's going on in there?

30:31.246 --> 30:32.371
Just a minute!

30:32.456 --> 30:34.790
We'd like to go
to the bathroom, please...

30:34.875 --> 30:37.084
-Yeah.
-...in this century.

30:37.169 --> 30:38.794
How long you been waiting?

30:38.879 --> 30:40.505
Like an hour now.

30:43.258 --> 30:44.717
Hi, Garth.

30:45.260 --> 30:46.385
Hi.

30:46.470 --> 30:48.554
I'm looking for Wayne.
I'm very concerned about him.

30:48.639 --> 30:51.098
He seems to be going through
this difficult phase right now.

30:51.183 --> 30:54.435
-You know what I think it is?
-That you're mental?

30:54.603 --> 30:56.562
You know him best.
What do you think I should do?

30:56.647 --> 30:58.773
Just get over it.
Go out with somebody else.

30:58.857 --> 31:00.900
"Get over it.
Go out with somebody else."

31:00.984 --> 31:03.069
Yeah, thanks. Okay, great.

31:04.613 --> 31:05.738
Hi.

31:08.242 --> 31:09.784
So, who's this guy, Benjamin?

31:09.868 --> 31:12.870
Only one of the most
important producers in television.

31:12.955 --> 31:14.247
He's way ahead of his time.

31:14.331 --> 31:17.333
We've signed with him.
He's based in Chicago.

31:17.459 --> 31:19.627
He gave me his business card.
He's interested in the band.

31:19.711 --> 31:22.713
Of course. I love your band.
You guys wail.

31:22.965 --> 31:24.715
-Thanks.
-You guys kick ass.

31:24.800 --> 31:26.050
You're double live gonzo,

31:26.134 --> 31:28.553
intensity in ten cities, live at Budokan.

31:28.679 --> 31:31.597
You know, if you guys got a break,
you could really make it.

31:31.682 --> 31:35.643
Yeah, and if a frog had wings, he
wouldn't bump his ass when he hopped.

31:35.811 --> 31:37.228
Interesting.

31:37.854 --> 31:39.564
Where did you learn English?

31:39.648 --> 31:40.815
College,

31:40.899 --> 31:43.150
and the Police Academy movies.

31:43.485 --> 31:44.485
Ah.

31:47.072 --> 31:48.489
Cassandra,

31:50.951 --> 31:53.661
I've got something I wanna say to you.

32:00.085 --> 32:02.044
Campbell, that's amazing.

32:02.129 --> 32:05.381
You learned how to say
I look pretty, in Cantonese.

32:19.271 --> 32:20.563
Hi, Wayne.

32:21.231 --> 32:22.481
Hello, Stacy.

32:22.649 --> 32:24.233
Sit right here.

33:27.172 --> 33:28.923
You make me laugh.

33:29.716 --> 33:31.300
Can I call you?

33:31.760 --> 33:32.843
Anytime.

33:37.599 --> 33:38.766
Look out!

33:48.527 --> 33:49.777
Oops.

34:24.062 --> 34:27.982
Sometimes I wish I could boldly go
where no man's gone before,

34:29.568 --> 34:31.985
but I'll probably stay in Aurora.

34:33.155 --> 34:35.947
-What are you thinking about?
-Cassandra.

34:36.324 --> 34:37.742
She's a fox.

34:38.118 --> 34:40.411
In France,
she would be called La Renarde,

34:40.495 --> 34:43.581
and she would be hunted,
with only her cunning to protect her.

34:43.665 --> 34:44.790
She's a babe.

34:44.875 --> 34:46.500
She's a robo-babe.

34:46.710 --> 34:49.335
In Latin, she would
be called babia majora.

34:49.545 --> 34:53.007
If she were a president,
she'd be Babe-raham Lincoln.

35:00.015 --> 35:02.224
Did you ever find Bugs Bunny attractive

35:02.309 --> 35:05.519
when he'd put on a dress
and play a girl bunny?

35:06.313 --> 35:07.354
No.

35:14.196 --> 35:15.196
No.

35:15.363 --> 35:17.823
Neither did I. I was just asking.

35:20.035 --> 35:22.203
Okay, okay, keep looking up!

35:22.412 --> 35:23.537
Okay.

35:46.561 --> 35:50.481
Guys, I will be talking to the cameraman
on the headset.

35:50.732 --> 35:52.983
It will be Terry's job
to give the actors their hand cues.

35:53.068 --> 35:57.071
Oh, excuse me, Russell,
but I believe I requested the hand job.

35:59.991 --> 36:01.158
Let's go on.

36:01.910 --> 36:04.370
The cue is... Watch carefully.

36:06.081 --> 36:08.916
Five, four, three...

36:12.087 --> 36:13.796
You didn't say "two" or "one."

36:14.005 --> 36:16.924
-Oh, you don't say "two" or "one."
-Why not?

36:17.092 --> 36:19.260
You just don't, okay?

36:20.262 --> 36:22.346
Now, it goes,

36:25.058 --> 36:28.811
five, four, three...

36:32.399 --> 36:34.441
-Good. Okay, good.
-Yeah, all right.

36:36.027 --> 36:38.821
All right, now,
I think we're ready for rehearsal,

36:38.905 --> 36:41.282
-unless there are any questions?
-Yeah.

36:41.366 --> 36:43.909
Does this seem weird to anybody else?

36:43.994 --> 36:47.204
I mean, we're looking down
on Wayne's basement,

36:47.706 --> 36:50.040
only that's not Wayne's basement.

36:50.166 --> 36:51.917
Isn't that weird?

36:52.335 --> 36:54.587
-That's twisted.
-That's weird, man, that's weird.

36:54.671 --> 36:57.298
Garth, that was a haiku.

36:59.301 --> 37:00.301
Excellent.

37:00.385 --> 37:02.011
-Control room.
-Russell.

37:02.262 --> 37:03.679
Oh, hello, Benjamin.

37:03.763 --> 37:05.806
Just finishing up with the Vanderhoffs.

37:05.891 --> 37:07.391
They'd like to come down
and look at a rehearsal

37:07.475 --> 37:10.394
and make sure
we're not wasting their money.

37:11.980 --> 37:15.024
-Not a good idea, sir.
-Great.

37:15.317 --> 37:18.652
Come in. Your landing gear is down.

37:18.737 --> 37:20.487
Just put that down.

37:20.614 --> 37:21.947
-Ow.
-Just go away, guys, okay?

37:22.032 --> 37:24.116
Let's just... Maybe go down to the set.
Hey, hey, hey!

37:24.534 --> 37:26.493
Russell's very excited
you're coming down to the studio.

37:26.578 --> 37:27.870
Oh, the studio.

37:28.580 --> 37:31.332
-That's where the magic happens.
-Oh, you've worked in television?

37:31.416 --> 37:33.000
No, but I watch a lot of it.

37:33.126 --> 37:35.252
Of course you do. You're creative.

37:35.337 --> 37:37.963
She's the one who came up
with the name Noah's Arcade.

37:38.048 --> 37:40.841
I just opened my mouth and out it came.

37:42.385 --> 37:45.054
You're a lucky man, Mr. Vanderhoff.

37:45.513 --> 37:48.724
All right, can we bring in
the blue screen? Let's try one.

37:49.225 --> 37:52.227
Ready to cue Wayne and Garth, and go.

37:52.312 --> 37:53.479
Okay.

37:53.605 --> 37:56.982
In five, four, three...

37:58.777 --> 38:02.237
Good, Terry.
Wayne, Garth, don't count along.

38:02.322 --> 38:04.531
We see your mouths moving. Again.

38:04.616 --> 38:07.701
In five, four, three...

38:07.994 --> 38:10.412
Guys, you're nodding.

38:10.789 --> 38:12.331
Once again, Terry.

38:12.666 --> 38:17.044
In five, four, three, two...

38:19.589 --> 38:21.757
Okay. Welcome to Wayne's World.
Party on, Garth.

38:21.841 --> 38:22.925
Party on, Wayne.

38:23.009 --> 38:25.344
Okay, we got a new feature
on Wayne's World this week,

38:25.428 --> 38:27.638
which allows us to travel
through time and space.

38:27.722 --> 38:28.847
It's called chroma key,

38:28.932 --> 38:32.476
and it's really handy
if you wanna go to...New York.

38:32.560 --> 38:34.061
Hey, we're in New York!

38:34.145 --> 38:36.647
I've got a gun.
Let's go to a Broadway show.

38:36.731 --> 38:38.273
I guess kids get this?

38:38.358 --> 38:39.733
-Oh, they love it.
-Yo, taxi.

38:40.026 --> 38:42.152
Or maybe you prefer Hawaii.

38:42.404 --> 38:44.488
Muka laka hickey.
Come on, you wanna lay me.

38:44.572 --> 38:46.407
Pass the poi, mahalo.

38:47.200 --> 38:49.326
Or say you wanna go to Texas.

38:49.411 --> 38:53.163
Howdy, partners.
Let's raise and rope broncos.

38:53.456 --> 38:54.498
Let's go down to the floor.

38:54.582 --> 38:56.000
Howdy, y'all.

38:56.501 --> 39:00.087
Or imagine being able to be magically
whisked away to

39:00.672 --> 39:01.755
Delaware.

39:02.590 --> 39:05.092
Hi. I'm in Delaware.

39:07.012 --> 39:08.345
Noah and Mimi Vanderhoff,

39:08.430 --> 39:10.931
say hello to Wayne Campbell
and Garth Algar.

39:11.016 --> 39:12.891
-It's a pleasure to meet you.
-Hi, nice to meet you.

39:12.976 --> 39:14.018
-Hello.
-So, Garth,

39:14.102 --> 39:16.812
how do you like being in a real studio?

39:17.272 --> 39:20.107
It's like a new pair of underwear,
you know?

39:20.734 --> 39:22.818
At first it's constrictive,

39:23.445 --> 39:26.321
but after a while,
it becomes a part of you.

39:29.242 --> 39:30.534
I gotta go.

39:30.618 --> 39:31.744
Okay.

39:32.912 --> 39:34.580
No, no, no. Please.

39:35.540 --> 39:37.458
Wayne, I used to be in meat packing,

39:37.542 --> 39:39.084
lips and hooves.

39:39.169 --> 39:42.671
And then, one day,
I had a four-hour layover in Tulsa.

39:43.131 --> 39:45.883
Well, there were these kids
in the airport that kept pumping quarters

39:45.967 --> 39:47.885
into a game called Pong.

39:47.969 --> 39:49.887
They must've gone through 50 bucks.

39:49.971 --> 39:51.847
Well, I sat there watching and I said,

39:51.931 --> 39:54.349
"Hell, I'm in the wrong business."

39:54.809 --> 39:57.352
Fifteen years later, I'm a millionaire.

39:59.189 --> 40:00.856
It's so huge.

40:01.024 --> 40:02.274
Thanks.

40:03.568 --> 40:04.985
Do I frighten you?

40:05.653 --> 40:06.820
No.

40:06.905 --> 40:08.489
Do you want me to?

40:08.573 --> 40:10.866
You know, Noah, I gotta tell you,
I love you on that couch.

40:10.950 --> 40:11.950
You think?

40:12.035 --> 40:14.870
Wayne, did you know that
Noah does all his own commercials?

40:14.954 --> 40:17.372
Yeah, I got a new one where I rap.

40:17.582 --> 40:20.334
Come bust a move
Where the games are played

40:20.418 --> 40:23.670
It's chill, it's fresh
It's Noah's Arcade

40:24.839 --> 40:26.882
What do you think of that?

40:27.258 --> 40:28.842
I'd have to say,

40:29.135 --> 40:31.011
ass sphincter says what?

40:32.180 --> 40:34.556
-What?
-A sphincter says what?

40:36.726 --> 40:38.811
-What?
-Exactly.

40:39.145 --> 40:40.437
Oh, we've got a lunch.

40:40.522 --> 40:42.856
-That's what I think of it.
-Okay.

40:43.191 --> 40:45.025
Well, it's been a pleasure.

40:45.610 --> 40:48.278
May I say, I have just had a thrilling day.

40:48.363 --> 40:49.613
-You may.
-Shall we?

40:49.697 --> 40:52.533
And may I say, your wife's a babe.

40:52.826 --> 40:54.660
-Well, thank you.
-We have a table.

41:08.675 --> 41:10.384
What is it, girl?

41:11.094 --> 41:13.387
Aliens have kidnapped Wayne?

41:14.097 --> 41:16.807
Oh, I misunderstood. Wayne's outside.

41:17.016 --> 41:18.225
Thanks, girl.

41:23.606 --> 41:27.151
Okay! Game on!

41:28.611 --> 41:31.155
-Game on.
-Game on.

41:34.742 --> 41:36.827
He shoots, he scores!

41:36.911 --> 41:38.287
One for one.

41:38.371 --> 41:39.454
Crowd is going wild!

41:39.539 --> 41:40.873
-Car!
-Car!

41:45.795 --> 41:47.921
-Game on.
-Game on.

41:50.758 --> 41:52.843
-Okay.
-All right, let's go.

41:53.595 --> 41:55.971
Gump Worsley cuts down the angle.

41:56.472 --> 41:57.681
Gretzky shoots!

41:57.765 --> 41:59.892
Oh, Gretzky is denied!

42:00.059 --> 42:02.019
Choked on the open net.

42:03.897 --> 42:05.731
-Wayne?
-Yeah?

42:05.815 --> 42:08.483
Do you ever get the feeling
that Benjamin's not one of us?

42:08.568 --> 42:09.693
Good call.

42:09.777 --> 42:12.696
It's as if Benjamin
wants us to be liked by everyone.

42:12.780 --> 42:15.532
I mean, Led Zeppelin didn't write tunes
that everyone liked.

42:15.617 --> 42:17.951
They left that to the Bee Gees.

42:18.036 --> 42:19.745
-Car!
-Car!

42:24.542 --> 42:26.752
-Game on.
-Game on.

42:30.882 --> 42:32.674
Incoming. Stacy, 10:00.

42:32.759 --> 42:34.051
Hi, Wayne.

42:35.762 --> 42:36.929
Hi.

42:41.559 --> 42:43.644
Hey, are you all right?

42:45.605 --> 42:46.772
Oops.

42:47.315 --> 42:48.857
And she's okay.

42:51.027 --> 42:52.277
Game on.

42:52.362 --> 42:53.987
Yeah, game on.

43:10.213 --> 43:13.632
You know, Garth,
you and I have never really talked.

43:15.343 --> 43:16.468
Okay.

43:17.470 --> 43:19.846
You know,
I love what you do on the show.

43:20.014 --> 43:23.433
I mean, I look at you,
and I just laugh and laugh.

43:24.811 --> 43:26.019
Uh-huh.

43:26.104 --> 43:29.022
Let me run this by you,
because you're a sharp guy.

43:29.816 --> 43:33.402
I'm thinking about giving Vanderhoff
a weekly interview on the show.

43:33.486 --> 43:36.113
How would you feel
about making a change?

43:36.197 --> 43:37.489
We fear change.

43:55.341 --> 43:57.509
So, Cassandra, I just have to say it,

43:57.593 --> 43:59.386
-you look excellent.
-Thanks.

43:59.470 --> 44:02.139
I've been so busy lately with my band,
I've been going shithouse.

44:02.223 --> 44:03.807
I thought I was getting meningitis.

44:03.891 --> 44:06.393
You know, I thought I had mono once
for an entire year.

44:06.477 --> 44:09.229
It turned out I was just really bored.

44:10.857 --> 44:13.650
You're so fine, you're so fine
You blow my mind

44:13.735 --> 44:15.152
Excuse me?

44:15.320 --> 44:18.155
I'm sorry. It's the last song I heard
this morning when I left the house.

44:18.239 --> 44:20.365
Oh, yeah. I hate when that happens.

44:20.450 --> 44:22.951
Hey, Mickey, you're so fine
You're so fine, you blow my mind

44:23.036 --> 44:25.245
Hey, Mickey
Hey, Mickey

44:25.747 --> 44:28.165
Hey, Mickey, you're so fine
You're so fine, you blow my mind

44:28.249 --> 44:29.666
Hey, Mickey

44:32.754 --> 44:35.422
I think I'm gonna put on some tunes.

44:36.090 --> 44:38.133
Hey, when did you get the CD player?

44:38.217 --> 44:39.760
When we got the money.

45:06.662 --> 45:08.121
There it is,

45:08.206 --> 45:09.289
Excalibur.

45:09.791 --> 45:13.502
Wow, a '64 Fender Stratocaster
in classic white,

45:13.586 --> 45:16.046
with triple single-coil pickups,
and a whammy bar.

45:16.130 --> 45:18.131
Pre-CBS Fender corporate buyout.

45:18.216 --> 45:20.050
I'd raise the bridge, file down the nut,

45:20.134 --> 45:21.802
and take the buzz out of the low "E."

45:21.886 --> 45:23.929
God, I love this woman.

45:25.181 --> 45:26.681
-Hi, Garth.
-Hi.

45:27.016 --> 45:28.308
Where's the clerk?

45:28.393 --> 45:31.186
I know. I'll use the "May I help you" riff.

45:36.484 --> 45:37.776
May I help you?

45:38.319 --> 45:39.653
Yes, my good man.

45:39.779 --> 45:41.988
I'd like to have a look at this
Fender Stratocaster, please.

45:42.073 --> 45:43.657
-Oh, really?
-Yes.

45:43.908 --> 45:45.158
-Again?
-Yes.

46:02.135 --> 46:03.593
Be careful.

46:12.186 --> 46:13.353
No Stairway.

46:13.688 --> 46:14.855
Denied!

46:58.274 --> 46:59.483
Wow!

46:59.567 --> 47:02.194
You're amazing, dude.

47:02.737 --> 47:03.862
Thanks.

47:04.113 --> 47:05.447
I like to play.

47:09.327 --> 47:11.036
Excuse me. Wayne?

47:12.371 --> 47:14.289
Can I put the Fender back now, please?

47:14.373 --> 47:17.250
Not today, my good man.
I'm feeling saucy.

47:17.335 --> 47:18.793
I think I'm gonna buy it.

47:18.878 --> 47:21.713
Do you accept...cash? Cha-ching.

47:30.598 --> 47:33.433
Have you spoken to Wayne
about the Vanderhoff spot?

47:33.518 --> 47:36.686
Yes, briefly. He was not very receptive.

47:37.188 --> 47:40.398
Oh, really? Well, I'll explain it to him
that it's not a choice,

47:40.483 --> 47:41.858
it's in his contract.

47:41.943 --> 47:44.694
Oh. Well, Wayne
will understand that right away.

47:46.155 --> 47:47.239
Not.

47:49.700 --> 47:50.909
Excuse me.

47:51.619 --> 47:53.703
I mean,
there was two Darrin Stephens, right?

47:53.788 --> 47:55.664
Dick York, Dick Sargent.

47:56.123 --> 47:58.959
Yeah, right, as if we wouldn't notice.

47:59.877 --> 48:00.961
Oh, hold on.

48:01.045 --> 48:02.963
Dick York. Dick Sargent.

48:03.256 --> 48:05.382
Sergeant York. Wow, that's weird.

48:08.052 --> 48:09.052
Wayne.

48:10.429 --> 48:13.181
Listen, we need to have
a talk about Vanderhoff.

48:13.391 --> 48:14.891
The fact is, he's the sponsor,

48:14.976 --> 48:18.228
and you signed a contract
guaranteeing him certain concessions,

48:18.312 --> 48:20.146
one of them being a spot on the show.

48:20.231 --> 48:22.732
Well, that's where I see things
just a little differently.

48:22.817 --> 48:25.610
Contract or no,
I will not bow to any sponsor.

48:29.365 --> 48:32.576
I'm sorry you feel that way, but
basically, it's the nature of the beast.

48:32.660 --> 48:34.077
Maybe I'm wrong on this one,

48:34.161 --> 48:36.871
but for me,
the beast doesn't include selling out.

48:41.210 --> 48:44.254
Garth, you know what
I'm talking about, right?

48:48.050 --> 48:51.177
It's like people only do things
because they get paid,

48:51.637 --> 48:53.847
and that's just really sad.

48:54.390 --> 48:57.559
I can't talk about it anymore.
It's giving me a headache.

48:58.311 --> 49:00.312
Here. Take two of these.

49:03.024 --> 49:06.151
Ah, Nuprin. Little. Yellow. Different.

49:07.361 --> 49:10.780
Look. You can stay here
in the big leagues and play by the rules,

49:10.865 --> 49:13.116
or you can
go back to the farm club in Aurora.

49:13.200 --> 49:14.784
-It's your choice.
-Yes,

49:14.869 --> 49:16.870
and it's the choice of a new generation.

49:26.964 --> 49:30.258
And her name was Cassandra

49:30.760 --> 49:31.885
Yeah.

49:35.640 --> 49:39.225
-Anything wrong, Davy?
-Yeah. I got paid today.

49:39.518 --> 49:41.895
-Oh, yeah, I know what that's like.
-No.

49:42.021 --> 49:44.481
You don't understand. They laid me off.

49:44.982 --> 49:46.441
I got one of these.

49:46.525 --> 49:48.693
Yeah, I know how that feels.

49:48.819 --> 49:52.322
-Know what I'd like to do?
-Yeah, I know what you'd like to do.

49:52.406 --> 49:54.658
You'd like to find the guy that did it,

49:54.742 --> 49:58.703
rip his still-beating heart out of
his chest, and hold it in front of his face

49:58.788 --> 50:01.873
so he can see how black it is
before he dies.

50:02.291 --> 50:05.877
Actually, I was thinking about
filing a grievance with the union.

50:06.587 --> 50:09.172
Well, the world's a twisted place.

50:12.718 --> 50:13.843
Hi.

50:13.928 --> 50:14.969
-Hey, how's it going, Garth?
-Hey, Garth.

50:15.054 --> 50:16.179
Good.

50:19.600 --> 50:21.434
Hey. There she is.

50:31.737 --> 50:33.530
I must have slipped.

50:34.365 --> 50:36.366
Wayne, what do you do

50:36.450 --> 50:39.494
if every time
you see this one incredible woman,

50:39.620 --> 50:41.246
you think you're gonna hurl?

50:41.330 --> 50:42.497
I say, hurl.

50:42.581 --> 50:45.834
If you blow chunks and she comes back,
she's yours.

50:45.918 --> 50:48.002
If you spew and she bolts,

50:48.462 --> 50:50.630
it was never meant to be.

50:51.465 --> 50:55.969
Oh, I'm not ready yet.
I gotta be comfortable with me first.

50:56.303 --> 50:57.887
Why don't you just go talk to her?

50:57.972 --> 51:00.515
Talk to her. Talk to her.

51:14.071 --> 51:15.113
Foxy

51:19.034 --> 51:20.326
Foxy

51:22.163 --> 51:26.374
You know you are
a cute little heartbreaker

51:27.668 --> 51:28.877
Foxy

51:29.587 --> 51:30.754
Yeah

51:31.756 --> 51:36.301
And you know you are
a sweet little lovemaker

51:37.553 --> 51:38.762
Foxy

51:41.474 --> 51:44.392
I wanna take you home

51:45.186 --> 51:46.603
Yeah

51:46.687 --> 51:49.814
I won't do you no harm, no

51:52.026 --> 51:55.111
You've got to be all mine, all mine

51:56.030 --> 51:57.906
Foxy lady

51:59.366 --> 52:00.784
Here I come, baby

52:01.911 --> 52:03.828
I'm coming to get you

52:03.913 --> 52:05.288
Why don't you just go talk to her?

52:05.372 --> 52:09.375
Why don't you just go talk to her?
Why don't you just go talk to her?

52:10.711 --> 52:11.711
Garth?

52:17.218 --> 52:18.384
Camera one.

52:19.053 --> 52:20.178
Camera two.

52:20.721 --> 52:21.971
Camera one.

52:22.389 --> 52:23.515
Camera two.

52:23.599 --> 52:25.225
Camera one, camera two.

52:25.392 --> 52:27.060
Camera one, camera two.

52:27.895 --> 52:28.978
Don't.

52:29.188 --> 52:31.105
Camera one, camera two.

52:33.567 --> 52:36.319
Tell me, when that first show is over,

52:36.403 --> 52:40.114
will you still love me when I'm
an incredibly humongoid, giant star?

52:40.199 --> 52:41.199
Yeah.

52:41.283 --> 52:44.869
Will you still love me when I'm in my
hanging-out-with-Ravi-Shankar phase?

52:44.954 --> 52:45.954
Yeah.

52:46.038 --> 52:49.457
Will you still love me when I'm in
my carbohydrate, sequined jump-suit,

52:49.542 --> 52:53.503
young-girls-in-white-cotton-panties,
waking-up-in-a-pool-of-your-own-vomit,

52:53.587 --> 52:56.297
bloated, purple, dead-on-a-toilet phase?

52:57.383 --> 53:00.343
-Yeah.
-Okay. Party. Bonus.

53:02.429 --> 53:03.555
Yeah?

53:03.764 --> 53:05.473
-Oh, hi, Anthony.
-Who's Anthony?

53:05.558 --> 53:07.141
-Who's Anthony?
-My drummer.

53:07.226 --> 53:08.476
Okay.

53:09.687 --> 53:10.854
You what?

53:11.647 --> 53:15.149
No. I told you next week
we'll be doing a music video.

53:18.195 --> 53:20.697
Do you mind? This is business.

53:22.241 --> 53:24.868
Hey, you wanna be a busboy
the rest of your life?

53:24.952 --> 53:27.245
Well, then talk to your boss.

53:31.792 --> 53:35.545
Look, this guy Benjamin is
putting up serious money for this thing.

53:35.629 --> 53:36.754
Yeah.

53:37.006 --> 53:38.798
Happy Birthday

53:39.425 --> 53:41.009
Mr. President

53:42.970 --> 53:44.721
Happy Birthday

53:45.931 --> 53:48.141
To you

53:50.728 --> 53:52.520
Work it out, okay?

53:52.605 --> 53:54.647
Just... No, just be there.

53:54.732 --> 53:55.940
Okay. Bye.

53:56.483 --> 53:58.151
You asshole!

54:07.161 --> 54:08.286
Excellent.

54:24.178 --> 54:27.221
-Hey. All right. Glad you could make it.
-Hi.

54:27.306 --> 54:28.973
-Oh, wow!
-Yes.

54:29.058 --> 54:30.099
Cool.

54:30.809 --> 54:32.268
Yes.

54:33.395 --> 54:35.229
This is definitely the type of place
I'm gonna get

54:35.314 --> 54:36.773
when I move out of my parents' house.

54:36.857 --> 54:38.441
Oh, you have a terrace.

54:38.525 --> 54:40.276
Oh, yeah. Why don't you go on out?

54:40.361 --> 54:42.487
I'll get the Dom Perignon.

54:47.034 --> 54:48.618
What floor is this?

54:48.702 --> 54:50.995
The 23rd.

54:57.211 --> 54:59.671
You know, Cassandra,

55:00.631 --> 55:02.131
from this height,

55:02.216 --> 55:04.634
you could really hock a loogie
on someone.

55:10.265 --> 55:12.266
You know, I feel so free up here.

55:12.351 --> 55:14.394
It costs a lot to live this free.

55:14.478 --> 55:17.105
You know, this might be a tangent, right,

55:17.314 --> 55:19.857
but it's something
I've been thinking about.

55:20.275 --> 55:21.401
Hi.

55:22.152 --> 55:25.405
If I had a girl like Cassandra,
I wouldn't bring her here.

55:25.489 --> 55:26.864
I mean, look at this place.

55:26.949 --> 55:30.368
This is a fully-functional babe lair.

55:30.494 --> 55:32.996
Chicks are helpless against its powers.

55:33.539 --> 55:35.248
Let's check it out.

55:35.541 --> 55:38.042
I don't believe I've ever had
French champagne before.

55:38.127 --> 55:41.504
Oh, actually, all champagne is French.
It's named after the region.

55:41.588 --> 55:44.090
Otherwise, it's sparkling white wine.

55:44.174 --> 55:46.426
Americans, of course,
don't recognize the convention,

55:46.510 --> 55:49.679
so it becomes that thing of calling
all of their sparkling whites champagne,

55:49.763 --> 55:51.264
even though by definition they're not.

55:51.348 --> 55:54.684
Ah, yes. It's a lot like
Star Trek: The Next Generation.

55:54.768 --> 55:59.480
In many ways it's superior, but will
never be as recognized as the original.

56:01.859 --> 56:03.860
Aha. What's this?

56:03.944 --> 56:06.696
"How To Pick-Up Chicks,"
"How to Meet Women."

56:06.780 --> 56:08.239
He's smooth.

56:10.367 --> 56:11.534
Aha.

56:12.828 --> 56:14.203
"Daily reminder.

56:14.538 --> 56:18.458
"Thursday. Purchase feeble
public access cable show

56:18.584 --> 56:20.209
"and exploit it."

56:20.294 --> 56:23.129
Whoa. I feel sorry for whoever that is.

56:23.714 --> 56:25.631
Let's look over here.

56:33.640 --> 56:35.892
"Ribbed for her pleasure."

56:38.479 --> 56:40.229
Well, the show looks great.

56:40.355 --> 56:43.357
Mr. Vanderhoff's very excited.
I'm very excited.

56:43.650 --> 56:47.945
I mean, I think the show's gonna be a
huge hit all over the Chicago land area.

56:48.030 --> 56:49.947
Look, I want you and Garth
to have these.

56:50.032 --> 56:52.950
It's two tickets to Alice Cooper's concert
tomorrow night in Milwaukee.

56:53.035 --> 56:54.911
Wow! Backstage passes.

56:54.995 --> 56:58.873
Whoa. All-access backstage
with Alice Cooper?

56:58.957 --> 56:59.999
Thank you.

57:00.084 --> 57:02.126
Take the day off. Enjoy yourselves.

57:02.211 --> 57:03.586
Well, what about Cassandra?

57:03.670 --> 57:06.005
She and I have work to do.

57:06.465 --> 57:10.176
-Here's to your success.
-No. Here's to Benjamin.

57:17.142 --> 57:18.768
Who wants Chinese takeout?

57:18.852 --> 57:20.353
I know a great place.

57:21.063 --> 57:23.815
I'll have the Cream of Sum Yung Guy.

57:27.152 --> 57:28.653
Cassandra, why don't you order?

57:28.737 --> 57:31.614
Oh, no.
I'm sure whatever you order will be fine.

57:31.698 --> 57:33.407
Oh, okay.

57:46.380 --> 57:47.463
Mountain Dew.

57:47.548 --> 57:49.132
Pepsi-Cola.

57:52.761 --> 57:54.428
This guy is good.

57:54.888 --> 57:57.598
Picked up a little Cantonese
when I was in the Orient.

57:57.683 --> 57:59.809
You know, you sound a lot like
you're from Kowloon Bay,

57:59.893 --> 58:01.060
as opposed to Hong Kong.

58:01.145 --> 58:03.229
I was born in Kowloon Bay.

58:03.522 --> 58:04.981
There you have it.

58:05.065 --> 58:06.691
This guy's really good.

58:09.444 --> 58:13.489
Well, I wanna tell you about me

58:17.202 --> 58:19.162
I asked you to stay

58:19.246 --> 58:22.790
And still you leave

58:23.125 --> 58:26.669
Well, I may look lonely and blue

58:27.379 --> 58:30.756
But I've been here waiting for you

58:32.259 --> 58:35.011
And I

58:35.095 --> 58:37.597
Want an answer or two

58:40.767 --> 58:43.436
Why you wanna break my heart?

58:43.896 --> 58:47.440
Ooh, why you wanna break my heart?

58:47.983 --> 58:51.777
Ooh, why you wanna break my heart?

58:51.987 --> 58:56.365
Ooh, why you wanna break my heart?

58:57.701 --> 58:59.952
-Sounds great!
-Thanks.

59:00.037 --> 59:01.787
-You got a minute?
-Sure.

59:01.872 --> 59:03.664
Hey, you guys, hang out.

59:03.749 --> 59:06.626
I thought I'd come by
and drop off the contract for the video.

59:06.710 --> 59:08.127
Oh, great.

59:08.879 --> 59:11.172
You know, I never really got a chance
to say thank you,

59:11.256 --> 59:12.506
but you've been very generous.

59:12.591 --> 59:14.717
Oh, well, it's been my pleasure.

59:14.801 --> 59:16.177
Listen, I thought if you were done here

59:16.261 --> 59:18.387
that maybe we could
spend the afternoon together.

59:22.392 --> 59:25.728
We should be pretty
close to Milwaukee by now.

59:34.655 --> 59:37.031
-Look! There's Sharps' brewery!
-Cool!

59:37.115 --> 59:40.993
One, two, three, four
five, six, seven, eight

59:41.078 --> 59:45.164
Schlemiel, schlimazel
Hasen Pfeffer Incorporated

01:00:11.108 --> 01:00:13.317
Hey, wait a minute. What are we doing?

01:00:13.402 --> 01:00:16.028
Yeah! We got backstage passes
for Alice Cooper!

01:01:09.082 --> 01:01:11.167
Do you wanna go backstage?

01:01:13.128 --> 01:01:15.963
Yeah. Let's go back now
and beat the crowd.

01:01:42.991 --> 01:01:44.950
-Where you going?
-Let him through. He's got a pass.

01:01:45.035 --> 01:01:46.911
-We got in!
-Excuse me, business.

01:01:46.995 --> 01:01:48.829
We got passes. Yeah!

01:01:55.837 --> 01:01:59.298
I think we took a wrong turn,
'cause we're outside now.

01:01:59.508 --> 01:02:01.550
Whoa, cool.

01:02:04.596 --> 01:02:06.389
Is this Alice's limo?

01:02:06.473 --> 01:02:09.558
No, it belongs to Frank Sharp,
head of Sharp Records.

01:02:09.643 --> 01:02:11.602
Good friend of Alice's.

01:02:11.686 --> 01:02:15.564
Wow, that's, like,
way bigger than a normal-size car.

01:02:15.649 --> 01:02:17.566
Well, it has to be.

01:02:17.651 --> 01:02:20.236
He drives everywhere. Hates to fly.

01:02:20.654 --> 01:02:24.698
He's going across the country right now
to look for new acts to sign to his label.

01:02:24.783 --> 01:02:26.617
Next stop is St. Louis,

01:02:26.701 --> 01:02:30.830
then he's gonna come back
through Chicago on his way to Detroit.

01:02:33.333 --> 01:02:34.708
Thanks.

01:02:38.922 --> 01:02:40.256
You know, for a security guard,

01:02:40.340 --> 01:02:43.717
he had an awful lot of information,
don't you think?

01:02:46.513 --> 01:02:48.514
Thank you, Milwaukee!

01:02:56.731 --> 01:02:58.816
Whoa, whoa, whoa, ladies, ladies.

01:02:58.900 --> 01:03:00.109
-Sorry, ladies.
-I'm sorry. No...

01:03:00.193 --> 01:03:01.694
Oh, you got passes, all right.
Come on, come on.

01:03:01.778 --> 01:03:02.778
-I'm sorry.
-Hurry up, hurry up.

01:03:02.863 --> 01:03:05.739
-Let us through, please.
-No, no, I can't let you in, sorry.

01:03:06.992 --> 01:03:08.325
Excuse us.

01:03:09.536 --> 01:03:11.787
Alice. Is this cool?

01:03:12.664 --> 01:03:13.914
Yeah, come on in.

01:03:13.999 --> 01:03:15.291
Sorry to bother you,

01:03:15.375 --> 01:03:17.793
but we had to come and tell you
how much we really enjoyed the show,

01:03:17.878 --> 01:03:19.628
didn't we, Garth?

01:03:21.673 --> 01:03:23.257
Oh. Thanks.

01:03:23.341 --> 01:03:26.552
We're not mental or anything,
so don't be afraid.

01:03:26.636 --> 01:03:29.263
My name is Wayne, and this is Garth.

01:03:30.056 --> 01:03:31.640
Nice to meet you guys.

01:03:32.684 --> 01:03:36.061
So, do you come to Milwaukee often?

01:03:37.814 --> 01:03:40.316
Well, I'm a regular visitor here,

01:03:40.400 --> 01:03:43.360
but Milwaukee has certainly had
its share of visitors.

01:03:43.445 --> 01:03:45.154
The French missionaries and explorers

01:03:45.238 --> 01:03:47.281
were coming here
as early as the late 1600s

01:03:47.365 --> 01:03:49.241
to trade with the Native Americans.

01:03:49.326 --> 01:03:51.619
In fact, isn't Milwaukee an Indian name?

01:03:51.703 --> 01:03:53.120
Yes, Pete, it is.

01:03:53.205 --> 01:03:55.539
Actually, it's pronounced
"mee-lee-wa-kay,"

01:03:55.624 --> 01:03:58.417
which is Algonquin
for "The Good Land."

01:03:58.793 --> 01:04:00.669
I was not aware of that.

01:04:00.754 --> 01:04:03.005
I think one of the most
interesting aspects of Milwaukee

01:04:03.089 --> 01:04:06.008
is the fact that it's
the only major American city

01:04:06.092 --> 01:04:08.594
to have ever elected
three socialist mayors.

01:04:08.720 --> 01:04:11.096
Does this guy
know how to party or what?

01:04:11.223 --> 01:04:13.265
Huh? Huh?

01:04:15.352 --> 01:04:18.270
Okay. Well, we gotta get going.

01:04:18.480 --> 01:04:21.357
No, no, no.
Stick around. Hang out with us.

01:04:22.275 --> 01:04:25.945
Cool. Yeah, we'll stay
and hang around with youse.

01:04:27.030 --> 01:04:28.864
With Alice Cooper.

01:04:31.034 --> 01:04:32.701
-We're not worthy!
-We're not worthy!

01:04:32.786 --> 01:04:34.703
-We're not worthy!
-We're not worthy!

01:04:34.788 --> 01:04:36.622
-We're not worthy!
-We're not worthy!

01:04:36.706 --> 01:04:38.249
We're scum!

01:04:38.333 --> 01:04:39.458
We suck!

01:04:43.046 --> 01:04:45.881
Our first big show,
and we almost didn't make it.

01:04:45.966 --> 01:04:48.509
I really hope Cassandra's watching.

01:04:51.721 --> 01:04:54.265
Oh, yeah, perfect.
Whatever it costs, I think...

01:04:54.349 --> 01:04:55.516
-Hey, there they are.
-Hi, guys.

01:04:55.600 --> 01:04:56.600
-Hello.
-Hey, how's it going?

01:04:56.685 --> 01:04:57.768
Well, tonight's the night.

01:04:57.852 --> 01:05:00.062
You know, a lot of people
in the Chicago land area

01:05:00.146 --> 01:05:01.939
are gonna be watching the show.

01:05:02.023 --> 01:05:05.192
You know what?
I already know it's gonna be a hit.

01:05:05.277 --> 01:05:07.152
I'll be in the booth.

01:05:07.320 --> 01:05:09.613
Mr. Vanderhoff will be your first guest.

01:05:09.698 --> 01:05:10.948
Oh, hi, boys.

01:05:11.825 --> 01:05:12.992
What the hell is this?

01:05:13.076 --> 01:05:15.077
Can we fly in the sign, please?

01:05:15.495 --> 01:05:17.079
All right, that's it. Just bring her down.

01:05:17.163 --> 01:05:19.206
-That's good.
-What... What...

01:05:19.291 --> 01:05:21.667
Don't tense up. You're gonna be great.

01:05:21.751 --> 01:05:24.044
Garth, have you got a second?

01:05:24.254 --> 01:05:25.796
Simply read the cards.

01:05:25.880 --> 01:05:28.340
You're going to be wonderful. Really.

01:05:28.425 --> 01:05:29.633
Okay?

01:05:30.468 --> 01:05:31.885
Oh, Russell,

01:05:32.178 --> 01:05:34.597
can I borrow your marker? I...

01:05:34.681 --> 01:05:37.099
-I need to make some notes.
-Sure.

01:05:38.810 --> 01:05:40.227
Good luck.

01:05:40.812 --> 01:05:42.021
My guys.

01:05:42.355 --> 01:05:43.856
You're my guys!

01:05:49.195 --> 01:05:51.947
Your name is pronounced "Algar," right?

01:05:52.157 --> 01:05:53.532
Okay.

01:05:53.825 --> 01:05:55.534
Wayne!

01:05:57.370 --> 01:05:58.537
-They'll be fine.
-Good.

01:05:59.205 --> 01:06:00.623
-Stand by.
-This is it, honey.

01:06:00.707 --> 01:06:04.501
In five, four, three...

01:06:08.173 --> 01:06:11.050
Wayne's World
is brought to you by Noah's Arcade.

01:06:11.217 --> 01:06:12.801
Party on, Wayne.

01:06:12.969 --> 01:06:14.386
Hey!

01:06:14.846 --> 01:06:17.389
Wayne's World, Wayne's World

01:06:17.807 --> 01:06:19.516
Party time

01:06:20.060 --> 01:06:21.477
Excellent

01:06:21.895 --> 01:06:23.937
It's Friday. It's 11:30.

01:06:24.022 --> 01:06:27.483
It's time to party with your
excellent host Wayne Campbell,

01:06:27.567 --> 01:06:30.069
and with him, as always, is Garth.

01:06:30.820 --> 01:06:33.572
Party on, Wayne, and party on, Garth.

01:06:33.740 --> 01:06:35.407
Wayne's World

01:06:37.369 --> 01:06:39.328
Okay. Welcome to Wayne's World.

01:06:39.412 --> 01:06:40.996
Party on, Garth.

01:06:41.081 --> 01:06:42.081
I guess.

01:06:42.540 --> 01:06:44.416
Okay, okay, first of all,

01:06:44.501 --> 01:06:47.211
we'd like to take
a moment here on Wayne's World

01:06:47.337 --> 01:06:48.837
to welcome our sponsor.

01:06:48.922 --> 01:06:52.466
He's the owner
of a fine chain of Noah's Arcades.

01:06:52.550 --> 01:06:54.885
Noah Vanderhoff. Nice name.

01:06:55.095 --> 01:06:56.220
Not.

01:06:57.222 --> 01:06:59.598
Now, Mr. Vanderhoff...

01:07:00.100 --> 01:07:02.184
He's using the cards. Yes!

01:07:02.268 --> 01:07:04.144
I told you he'd fall in line.

01:07:04.479 --> 01:07:07.272
What is your most
popular video game right now?

01:07:07.899 --> 01:07:09.983
Desert Storm Commando Warrior.

01:07:11.945 --> 01:07:15.030
That would have to do with that
limited skirmish in the Middle East.

01:07:15.115 --> 01:07:16.115
Yes.

01:07:16.282 --> 01:07:18.325
What the hell's he doing?

01:07:18.743 --> 01:07:21.745
Aren't there long lines
for your more popular games?

01:07:21.996 --> 01:07:24.832
Well, at Noah's Arcade, we like to say

01:07:24.958 --> 01:07:27.793
there's two of everything,
so there's never a line.

01:07:28.378 --> 01:07:31.797
Okay. Now, tell me, Noah,
I've always wanted to know,

01:07:31.881 --> 01:07:35.592
what is the difference between Pac-Man
and Ms. Pac-Man, really?

01:07:36.010 --> 01:07:37.970
Well, she has a bow on her head.

01:07:39.097 --> 01:07:40.472
That's it?

01:07:42.517 --> 01:07:45.185
-Get right out of town.
-No, that's it.

01:07:54.279 --> 01:07:55.988
Well, thank you for being
on Wayne's World.

01:07:56.072 --> 01:07:58.240
It was informative and stimulating.

01:07:58.366 --> 01:08:00.492
Now, a word from our sponsor.

01:08:01.578 --> 01:08:02.911
We're at commercial.

01:08:02.996 --> 01:08:04.830
-Oh, that was fun.
-Okay.

01:08:05.582 --> 01:08:07.499
-Well, I'll see you next week.
-I hope.

01:08:07.584 --> 01:08:10.586
Wayne, could you
come up to the booth, please?

01:08:10.670 --> 01:08:12.671
Oh, honey, you were incredible.

01:08:13.173 --> 01:08:15.382
I think it went really well.

01:08:15.842 --> 01:08:19.219
Absolutely, honey. There was a huge
response in that little room up there.

01:08:19.304 --> 01:08:20.595
-Really?
-Sir, I can assure you that

01:08:20.680 --> 01:08:24.433
those phrases were not on the cards
when I gave them to him.

01:08:24.517 --> 01:08:27.560
Wayne, what the hell is going on?

01:08:27.645 --> 01:08:28.770
What are you doing?

01:08:28.854 --> 01:08:30.522
Same thing we always do.

01:08:30.857 --> 01:08:33.524
You've publicly humiliated the sponsor.

01:08:33.609 --> 01:08:35.109
-Yeah.
-You're fired.

01:08:35.194 --> 01:08:36.779
Fired? For that?

01:08:36.863 --> 01:08:40.491
Yeah. Right. That's it, I'm out of here,

01:08:40.575 --> 01:08:43.786
-and I'm taking my show with me.
-We own the show.

01:08:44.162 --> 01:08:45.578
Bite me.

01:08:48.207 --> 01:08:49.374
Okay.

01:08:49.876 --> 01:08:51.210
Are we back?

01:08:52.545 --> 01:08:53.629
Stand by.

01:08:53.712 --> 01:08:54.837
Coming back?

01:08:54.923 --> 01:08:55.964
And go.

01:08:56.049 --> 01:08:58.509
Five, four, three...

01:09:06.768 --> 01:09:09.478
I'm having a good time.

01:09:09.562 --> 01:09:10.938
Not.

01:09:13.733 --> 01:09:16.568
Did you ever see that scene in Scanners
when that dude's head blew up?

01:09:26.037 --> 01:09:27.662
-Hello?
-Hello.

01:09:27.747 --> 01:09:28.831
It's Benjamin.

01:09:28.915 --> 01:09:29.997
Oh, hi.

01:09:30.625 --> 01:09:32.501
Listen, did you see the show tonight?

01:09:32.585 --> 01:09:35.002
I had to work at the club
so I only saw the first part,

01:09:35.087 --> 01:09:37.171
but I laughed my ass off.

01:09:37.506 --> 01:09:39.091
Well, we had some
technical difficulties,

01:09:39.175 --> 01:09:41.969
and we're still playing with the format.

01:09:42.386 --> 01:09:44.429
Has Wayne talked to you?

01:09:45.348 --> 01:09:46.640
About what?

01:09:46.724 --> 01:09:48.350
Why? Are you canceling my video?

01:09:48.434 --> 01:09:51.185
No. In fact,
I called just to make sure we're still on.

01:09:51.270 --> 01:09:54.189
-Well, we got a deal, right?
-Absolutely.

01:09:54.941 --> 01:09:56.608
I'll see you in Chicago.

01:09:56.776 --> 01:09:58.235
Okay. Bye.

01:10:03.658 --> 01:10:06.034
You really pissed me off tonight.

01:10:06.119 --> 01:10:09.079
Garth, you've never been mad
at anything in your life.

01:10:09.163 --> 01:10:11.707
Yeah, but you shouldn't
have walked out on the show.

01:10:11.791 --> 01:10:14.334
I mean, you know, I handled it okay,

01:10:14.419 --> 01:10:17.170
but you shouldn't walk out on your friend
without telling him first.

01:10:17.255 --> 01:10:19.715
Oh, so I have to run everything
by you now?

01:10:19.799 --> 01:10:22.593
Yeah, I think you have to run everything
by me now.

01:10:22.677 --> 01:10:24.428
What am I, some sort of chimp?

01:10:24.512 --> 01:10:26.388
"With you, as always, is Garth"?

01:10:26.472 --> 01:10:28.307
Jim to your Marlin Perkins?

01:10:28.474 --> 01:10:30.642
You know,
Benjamin had you so snowed.

01:10:30.810 --> 01:10:33.395
You know what?
He's got it for Cassandra.

01:10:33.479 --> 01:10:35.230
-No way.
-Way.

01:10:35.356 --> 01:10:38.775
Yeah! Cassandra's not interested. As if.

01:10:39.485 --> 01:10:41.194
Okay, pop quiz,

01:10:41.279 --> 01:10:43.906
Cassandra is not interested
in Benjamin because:

01:10:43.990 --> 01:10:46.199
A) chicks think he's handsome,

01:10:46.284 --> 01:10:48.160
B) has cool car,

01:10:48.244 --> 01:10:50.746
C) has lots of cash,

01:10:50.830 --> 01:10:52.748
D) has no visible scars,

01:10:52.832 --> 01:10:55.626
E) does not live with parents.

01:10:55.710 --> 01:10:59.129
Okay, how about, "F) you're a gimp"?

01:10:59.213 --> 01:11:01.006
You know what you can do
with your pop quiz?

01:11:01.090 --> 01:11:03.425
You know what you can do
with your show?

01:11:03.635 --> 01:11:05.344
You can take a flying...

01:11:15.146 --> 01:11:16.563
...until the handle breaks off

01:11:16.648 --> 01:11:19.900
and you have to find a doctor
to pull it out again.

01:11:19.984 --> 01:11:21.860
Kiss your mother with that mouth?

01:11:21.945 --> 01:11:23.278
You've gone mental.

01:11:23.363 --> 01:11:25.280
I'm getting out of here, Damien.

01:11:25.365 --> 01:11:27.032
-Fine, then. Go.
-I'm gone.

01:11:27.116 --> 01:11:28.909
-Go, then.
-I am.

01:11:28.993 --> 01:11:30.327
-Go.
-I'm gone.

01:11:30.411 --> 01:11:31.995
-Go, then.
-Well, I am.

01:11:45.802 --> 01:11:47.803
Where you been?
I waited up for you last night,

01:11:47.887 --> 01:11:49.888
but you never showed.

01:11:51.265 --> 01:11:53.100
-Where you going?
-Chicago.

01:11:53.184 --> 01:11:54.643
Benjamin set up the video shoot.

01:11:54.727 --> 01:11:56.812
I'll be there for three days.

01:11:56.896 --> 01:11:59.398
Oh, well, I guess
Benjamin will be there, too.

01:11:59.524 --> 01:12:01.984
Well, he's producing it.
And what does that mean?

01:12:02.068 --> 01:12:03.193
Well, it just means that he's been

01:12:03.277 --> 01:12:05.862
paying you an awful lot
of attention lately.

01:12:05.947 --> 01:12:08.448
Well, maybe he thinks
I've got some talent.

01:12:08.992 --> 01:12:10.909
Maybe he's poking you.

01:12:12.203 --> 01:12:13.286
What?

01:12:14.080 --> 01:12:15.831
You think that's the way I get a gig?

01:12:15.915 --> 01:12:17.916
Well, first he screws me,
then he screws you,

01:12:18.001 --> 01:12:19.710
it's Dutch door action.

01:12:21.713 --> 01:12:24.089
Could you be any more insulting?

01:12:24.799 --> 01:12:26.091
Yeah.

01:12:28.428 --> 01:12:30.595
I think you'd better leave.

01:12:32.223 --> 01:12:34.891
Fine. I'm out of here.

01:12:41.441 --> 01:12:43.108
Oh, man.

01:12:45.945 --> 01:12:47.654
What the hell's going on?

01:12:47.947 --> 01:12:50.949
I lost my show, I lost my best friend,

01:12:51.242 --> 01:12:52.534
I lost my girl.

01:12:52.702 --> 01:12:54.911
I'm being shit on, that's all, shit on.

01:12:54.996 --> 01:12:57.456
And do you know
what really pisses me off?

01:12:57.957 --> 01:12:59.249
Where are you going?
Where are you going?

01:12:59.333 --> 01:13:01.877
Okay, okay. Come on back.
Come on back.

01:13:02.670 --> 01:13:05.130
Things aren't as bad as they seem.

01:13:05.465 --> 01:13:07.549
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to dump on you.

01:13:07.633 --> 01:13:09.551
I'll figure something out.

01:13:09.635 --> 01:13:10.635
Okay?

01:13:16.142 --> 01:13:18.685
Hey, Mr. Donuthead Man,
who's trying to kill you?

01:13:18.770 --> 01:13:20.854
I don't know, but they better not.

01:13:22.148 --> 01:13:24.274
You know, if you stab a man
in the dead of winter,

01:13:24.358 --> 01:13:27.277
-steam will rise up from the wounds.
-Oh, yeah.

01:13:28.988 --> 01:13:30.864
That's not good! I'm not happy!

01:13:30.948 --> 01:13:32.908
Oh, no!

01:13:32.992 --> 01:13:36.244
Indians believed it was his soul
escaping from his body.

01:13:36.329 --> 01:13:37.746
Right, Glen.

01:13:45.797 --> 01:13:47.130
Hi.

01:13:53.096 --> 01:13:54.096
Hi.

01:13:54.722 --> 01:13:56.515
I'm sorry about what I did.

01:13:58.267 --> 01:13:59.351
Buds?

01:14:01.354 --> 01:14:02.479
Buds.

01:14:07.527 --> 01:14:08.777
Officer Koharski.

01:14:08.861 --> 01:14:11.279
Damn shame how they
screwed up your show.

01:14:11.489 --> 01:14:13.698
It was a nice little program.

01:14:14.158 --> 01:14:16.409
Not that I ever watched it.

01:14:17.078 --> 01:14:18.787
Here you go.

01:14:18.913 --> 01:14:20.747
So, how you doing?

01:14:20.873 --> 01:14:22.290
Okay, I suppose.

01:14:22.375 --> 01:14:24.376
Just wish I had Cassandra back.

01:14:24.460 --> 01:14:28.004
She's in Chicago
shooting a video with Benjamin.

01:14:28.548 --> 01:14:29.548
So...

01:14:30.550 --> 01:14:32.134
What are you going to do?

01:14:32.218 --> 01:14:33.468
I don't know.

01:14:33.761 --> 01:14:35.595
I do have one plan.

01:14:39.600 --> 01:14:41.268
What are you gonna do
with these guys?

01:14:41.352 --> 01:14:43.103
Oh, nothing, really.

01:14:45.606 --> 01:14:47.858
I just always wanted
to open a door to a room

01:14:47.942 --> 01:14:51.528
where people are being trained,
like in James Bond movies.

01:14:51.612 --> 01:14:53.238
-Wicked.
-Yeah.

01:14:59.495 --> 01:15:02.122
I think you should
just go get Cassandra.

01:15:02.206 --> 01:15:04.833
I just don't think she wants me to.

01:15:05.960 --> 01:15:09.421
Let me tell you a little something
I've learned about women.

01:15:09.505 --> 01:15:12.340
They want you to come get them.

01:15:16.929 --> 01:15:18.430
They love it.

01:15:20.391 --> 01:15:22.267
I just wish there was something
that I could offer her

01:15:22.351 --> 01:15:24.186
that Benjamin couldn't.

01:15:24.270 --> 01:15:26.396
You'll think of something.

01:15:27.064 --> 01:15:28.607
Wait a minute.

01:15:28.941 --> 01:15:29.983
No.

01:15:30.443 --> 01:15:32.110
Wait a minute.

01:15:32.278 --> 01:15:33.445
No.

01:15:33.529 --> 01:15:34.696
Wait a minute!

01:15:34.780 --> 01:15:37.199
I know, the guy in the limo, Mr. Big,

01:15:37.283 --> 01:15:39.618
the guy who owns Sharp Records.

01:15:39.702 --> 01:15:42.704
If there's only a way that we could
get him to listen to Cassandra play.

01:15:42.788 --> 01:15:44.206
Hold it, hold it.

01:15:44.624 --> 01:15:46.583
You remember the security guard
at the concert?

01:15:46.667 --> 01:15:49.878
He said Mr. Sharp was driving
back through Chicago on Friday!

01:15:49.962 --> 01:15:52.088
That's right. Wow.

01:15:52.715 --> 01:15:55.884
Aren't we lucky we were there
to get all that information?

01:15:55.968 --> 01:15:58.053
It seemed extraneous at the time.

01:15:58.179 --> 01:16:01.848
Okay, first I'll access
the secret military spy satellite

01:16:01.933 --> 01:16:04.309
that's in a geosynchronous orbit
over the Midwest.

01:16:04.393 --> 01:16:07.562
Then I'll ID the limo
by the vanity plate "Mr. Biggg"

01:16:07.647 --> 01:16:10.190
-and get its approximate position.
-Yes.

01:16:10.316 --> 01:16:12.400
Then I'll reposition the transmitter dish

01:16:12.485 --> 01:16:15.528
in the remote truck
to 17.32 degrees East,

01:16:15.947 --> 01:16:17.197
hit Westar IV over the Atlantic,

01:16:17.281 --> 01:16:19.908
bounce the signal down into the Azores,
up to comtech six,

01:16:19.992 --> 01:16:23.119
beam it back to Satcom III,
transponder number 137,

01:16:23.204 --> 01:16:26.581
and down to the dish
on the back of Mr. Big's limo.

01:16:27.041 --> 01:16:28.959
It's almost too easy.

01:16:30.670 --> 01:16:33.713
We can only pray
he's watching television in his limo

01:16:33.798 --> 01:16:35.465
at that exact moment.

01:16:35.675 --> 01:16:37.133
We'll need help.

01:16:37.218 --> 01:16:38.843
-We'll help.
-We'll help.

01:16:38.928 --> 01:16:40.804
You get Cassandra! We'll do the rest!

01:16:41.597 --> 01:16:43.515
To the Mirthmobile!

01:16:43.849 --> 01:16:44.975
Yeah!

01:16:46.185 --> 01:16:47.269
All right!

01:16:53.276 --> 01:16:55.360
Okay, this is a take, everybody.

01:16:55.444 --> 01:16:57.862
I think the snake fell asleep!

01:17:02.159 --> 01:17:03.493
Playback!

01:17:09.792 --> 01:17:11.209
Looking good.

01:17:15.214 --> 01:17:19.551
Ain't got no reason for reaction

01:17:20.386 --> 01:17:21.886
No

01:17:23.055 --> 01:17:26.933
Ain't got no reason for distraction

01:17:30.730 --> 01:17:34.357
I love the way that you love me, baby

01:17:34.734 --> 01:17:38.111
Love the way that you stare

01:17:38.821 --> 01:17:42.115
The way that you tease me, baby

01:17:43.492 --> 01:17:45.952
Touch me, yeah

01:17:46.037 --> 01:17:47.829
Touch me

01:17:48.372 --> 01:17:50.498
This snake weighs a ton.

01:17:50.583 --> 01:17:52.167
It looks great on you.

01:17:52.418 --> 01:17:53.877
I'm coming down now.

01:17:53.961 --> 01:17:56.129
I'm telling you, you're hot.

01:18:31.916 --> 01:18:34.209
Yes, officer? Is there something wrong?

01:18:35.127 --> 01:18:37.170
Have you seen this boy?

01:18:48.599 --> 01:18:50.433
You know, you're exactly right.

01:18:50.518 --> 01:18:51.976
Why leave the hotel?

01:18:52.561 --> 01:18:54.979
We'll have dinner sent up.
You can have a hot bath.

01:18:55.064 --> 01:18:56.398
-I'll make some calls.
-Cassandra!

01:18:56.482 --> 01:18:58.483
-Hold this.
-Cassandra!

01:18:59.443 --> 01:19:01.903
-We have to talk.
-I don't wanna talk to you.

01:19:01.987 --> 01:19:04.572
Cassandra, I've set up
an audition for you and your band.

01:19:04.657 --> 01:19:07.409
I'm putting my show back on the air.
You've got to be on it.

01:19:07.493 --> 01:19:08.576
Wayne, go home.

01:19:08.661 --> 01:19:10.578
No. I'm not going anywhere.

01:19:10.663 --> 01:19:12.705
Cassandra, I love you.

01:19:12.790 --> 01:19:15.417
You may not believe it, but I love you.

01:19:15.501 --> 01:19:18.753
Am I supposed to just
turn my back and leave?

01:19:20.047 --> 01:19:22.006
Am I supposed to be a man?

01:19:22.133 --> 01:19:25.802
Am I supposed to say,
"That's okay. I don't mind.

01:19:27.596 --> 01:19:30.223
"I don't mind!" Well, I mind!

01:19:30.307 --> 01:19:32.016
I mind big time!

01:19:33.310 --> 01:19:36.062
And you know what
the worst part of all is?

01:19:36.147 --> 01:19:39.023
I never learned to read.

01:19:42.445 --> 01:19:43.611
Is that true?

01:19:43.696 --> 01:19:46.489
Yes. Everything except the reading part.

01:19:47.867 --> 01:19:50.452
Very nice speech, Wayne.
We're very busy.

01:19:50.536 --> 01:19:52.912
Oh, of course. Her music video.

01:19:53.539 --> 01:19:54.747
Very clever.

01:19:54.832 --> 01:19:56.416
But where is her band?

01:19:56.876 --> 01:19:58.042
-Hi, Wayne.
-Hi, Wayne.

01:19:58.127 --> 01:20:00.837
Oh, hi, guys. I didn't see you there.

01:20:02.548 --> 01:20:05.258
Well, I guess you've thought
of everything, huh?

01:20:05.551 --> 01:20:08.678
Nothing left for me to do
but just go home.

01:20:08.762 --> 01:20:11.055
Bye-bye, Wayne. It's bedtime.

01:20:11.515 --> 01:20:13.516
But both you and I know

01:20:13.601 --> 01:20:16.603
that there is no film in this camera.

01:20:20.858 --> 01:20:22.025
Jimmy!

01:20:26.405 --> 01:20:27.572
Wayne!

01:20:28.407 --> 01:20:29.824
Go home.

01:20:40.377 --> 01:20:42.128
Sometimes people outgrow
one another.

01:20:42.213 --> 01:20:45.173
It's very sad,
but you can't let it drag you down.

01:20:45.257 --> 01:20:47.717
Is that you or the snake?

01:20:52.431 --> 01:20:54.098
Campbell, wait up!

01:20:54.183 --> 01:20:56.851
Cassandra, I know
I don't have his looks.

01:20:56.936 --> 01:20:58.353
I know I don't have his money.

01:20:58.437 --> 01:21:02.023
I know I don't have his connections,
his knowledge of fine wines.

01:21:02.107 --> 01:21:05.318
I know sometimes, that when I eat,
I get this clicking sound in my jaw...

01:21:05.402 --> 01:21:07.904
Shut your yap and get in the car.

01:21:08.489 --> 01:21:09.781
Excellent.

01:21:21.919 --> 01:21:22.961
That's right, girl.

01:21:23.045 --> 01:21:26.172
Mr. Big's limousine
is right where we want it.

01:21:33.889 --> 01:21:36.849
Gentlemen, this is it. Let's go.

01:21:36.934 --> 01:21:38.268
Down now!

01:21:46.235 --> 01:21:50.029
Wait up, guys. I fell on my keys.

01:21:53.742 --> 01:21:56.369
Ow, ow, ow, ow.

01:22:10.884 --> 01:22:12.135
Freeze!

01:22:12.219 --> 01:22:14.095
Oh, hi, Russell. How's it going?

01:22:14.179 --> 01:22:16.180
Hold it right there. Hey, hey!

01:22:16.432 --> 01:22:19.434
Hey, watch where
you're pointing that thing.

01:22:19.685 --> 01:22:22.770
Give me the flashlight, Russell.
Give it to me.

01:22:23.230 --> 01:22:26.691
-You can help us, Russell.
-No! I'm supposed to stop you.

01:22:27.192 --> 01:22:28.901
What are you gonna do?

01:22:28.986 --> 01:22:32.155
You gonna be Benjamin's monkey boy
the rest of your life, is that it?

01:22:32.239 --> 01:22:34.198
-Benjamin's my friend.
-No.

01:22:34.825 --> 01:22:37.535
Benjamin is no one's friend.

01:22:38.704 --> 01:22:42.123
If Benjamin were an ice cream flavor,

01:22:42.458 --> 01:22:45.376
he'd be pralines and dick.

01:22:47.504 --> 01:22:48.963
It's okay!

01:22:52.051 --> 01:22:54.385
He's gonna be okay.

01:22:57.514 --> 01:22:58.640
Hi.

01:22:58.974 --> 01:23:00.224
-Hi.
-How's it going?

01:23:09.860 --> 01:23:11.235
I love you, man.

01:23:11.779 --> 01:23:12.987
I know.

01:23:15.240 --> 01:23:16.491
No, you don't.

01:23:17.326 --> 01:23:19.369
I love you, man.

01:23:21.080 --> 01:23:22.205
I know.

01:23:23.332 --> 01:23:25.124
Just say, "Thank you."

01:23:26.460 --> 01:23:27.585
Hey!

01:23:31.090 --> 01:23:32.173
Thank you.

01:23:33.258 --> 01:23:34.300
All right.

01:23:34.802 --> 01:23:38.054
I understand you're just doing your job,
but really, I'm very late.

01:23:38.138 --> 01:23:41.474
Would you mind turning around,
placing your hands on the hood, son?

01:23:41.558 --> 01:23:44.102
There's just one other thing
I've got to check.

01:23:54.279 --> 01:23:56.030
Wayne's World, Wayne's World

01:23:56.115 --> 01:23:58.241
Party time, excellent

01:24:01.704 --> 01:24:04.580
Okay, this is
a special Wayne's World, okay?

01:24:04.665 --> 01:24:06.457
It's for an audience of one.

01:24:06.625 --> 01:24:09.335
So, Mr. Frankie Sharp
of Sharp Records,

01:24:09.420 --> 01:24:11.921
if you're watching,
and if you like what you see,

01:24:12.005 --> 01:24:15.591
we're at 2234 Pine Way,
in Aurora, Illinois.

01:24:15.926 --> 01:24:17.427
So, ladies and gentlemen,

01:24:17.511 --> 01:24:21.305
I give you Cassandra and Crucial Taunt!

01:24:21.807 --> 01:24:23.725
-Yeah!
-Right on.

01:24:26.937 --> 01:24:29.397
Well, it's been getting so hard

01:24:29.481 --> 01:24:32.984
Living with the things you do to me

01:24:35.654 --> 01:24:38.322
My dreams are getting so strange

01:24:38.407 --> 01:24:41.659
I'd like to tell you everything I see

01:24:44.663 --> 01:24:46.831
I see a man at the back
as a matter of fact

01:24:46.915 --> 01:24:49.041
His eyes are as red as the sun

01:24:49.126 --> 01:24:51.294
And a girl in the corner
let no one ignore her

01:24:51.378 --> 01:24:53.921
'Cause she thinks
she's the passionate one

01:24:54.006 --> 01:24:55.590
Oh, yeah

01:24:55.674 --> 01:24:57.341
It was like lightning

01:24:57.426 --> 01:24:59.677
Everybody was frightening

01:24:59.887 --> 01:25:01.929
And the music was soothing

01:25:02.014 --> 01:25:03.973
And they all started grooving

01:25:04.057 --> 01:25:07.143
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

01:25:07.227 --> 01:25:09.437
And the man at the back
said everyone attack

01:25:09.521 --> 01:25:11.314
And it turned into a ballroom blitz

01:25:11.398 --> 01:25:13.608
And the girl in the corner said
Boy, I wanna warn you

01:25:13.692 --> 01:25:15.568
It'll turn into a ballroom blitz

01:25:15.652 --> 01:25:17.069
Ballroom blitz

01:25:19.990 --> 01:25:21.574
Ballroom blitz

01:25:24.703 --> 01:25:27.288
I'm reaching out for something

01:25:27.372 --> 01:25:30.208
Touching nothing's all I ever do

01:25:33.670 --> 01:25:35.797
I softly call you over

01:25:36.256 --> 01:25:40.092
When you appear
there's nothing left of you

01:25:42.554 --> 01:25:44.680
Now the man at the back
is ready to crack

01:25:44.765 --> 01:25:46.933
As he raises his hands to the sky

01:25:47.017 --> 01:25:49.143
And the girl in the corner
is everyone's mourner

01:25:49.228 --> 01:25:51.646
She could kill you
with a wink of her eye

01:25:51.730 --> 01:25:53.523
Oh, yeah

01:25:53.607 --> 01:25:55.149
It was electric

01:25:55.234 --> 01:25:57.318
So frightfully hectic

01:25:57.402 --> 01:25:59.737
And the band started leaping

01:25:59.822 --> 01:26:01.739
'Cause they all stopped breathing

01:26:01.824 --> 01:26:02.949
Yeah

01:26:03.033 --> 01:26:05.117
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

01:26:05.202 --> 01:26:07.078
And the man at the back
said everyone attack

01:26:07.162 --> 01:26:09.163
And it turned into a ballroom blitz

01:26:09.248 --> 01:26:11.499
And the girl in the corner said
Boy I wanna warn you

01:26:11.583 --> 01:26:13.334
It'll turn into a ballroom blitz

01:26:13.418 --> 01:26:14.919
Ballroom blitz

01:26:17.756 --> 01:26:19.340
Ballroom blitz

01:26:51.707 --> 01:26:53.249
Yeah!

01:26:54.459 --> 01:26:56.711
Hi. I'm Frankie Sharp, Sharp Records.

01:26:56.795 --> 01:26:58.796
I saw your performance in my limo.

01:26:58.881 --> 01:27:01.841
I must say,
I've seen a lot of acts in my day,

01:27:01.925 --> 01:27:04.135
and although you're extremely beautiful,

01:27:04.219 --> 01:27:06.762
I just think it's the wrong time.

01:27:07.014 --> 01:27:08.431
-I'm sorry.
-Bummer, man.

01:27:09.892 --> 01:27:11.809
You screwed my career!

01:27:12.936 --> 01:27:15.229
I always knew you were small-time.

01:27:16.857 --> 01:27:20.651
Wayne, I'm pregnant,
that's why I've been so moody.

01:27:24.531 --> 01:27:25.865
Whoa!

01:27:26.074 --> 01:27:27.575
Look! A fire!

01:27:27.659 --> 01:27:28.868
Let's get out of here!

01:27:30.495 --> 01:27:31.454
My hair!

01:27:31.455 --> 01:27:31.495
My hair!

01:27:44.259 --> 01:27:45.760
Why, God?

01:27:46.970 --> 01:27:48.846
Why?

01:27:55.938 --> 01:27:59.690
Last night was the most incredible night
of my life.

01:28:00.734 --> 01:28:02.735
You were terrific.

01:28:13.413 --> 01:28:15.790
You didn't really think
she'd end up with Wayne, did you?

01:28:17.709 --> 01:28:18.751
As if.

01:28:18.835 --> 01:28:21.504
As if we'd end the movie like that. Yeah!

01:28:21.672 --> 01:28:24.006
-Let's do the Scooby-Doo ending.
-Good call.

01:28:42.776 --> 01:28:45.319
Hi. Frankie Sharp, Sharp Records.

01:28:45.529 --> 01:28:47.279
I just saw your performance in my limo.

01:28:47.364 --> 01:28:50.074
Wow, we got through.
Well, that wraps it up.

01:28:50.200 --> 01:28:51.826
But there's one last thing.

01:28:51.910 --> 01:28:54.912
Let's just see who you really are, mister.

01:28:56.415 --> 01:28:59.291
Why, it's Old Man Withers, the guy
who runs the haunted amusement park!

01:28:59.376 --> 01:29:03.546
And I would have got away with it, too,
if it hadn't been for you snooping kids!

01:29:03.630 --> 01:29:05.256
Good one, Shaggy.

01:29:05.841 --> 01:29:07.174
Excellent Scooby-Doo ending.

01:29:07.259 --> 01:29:09.010
Yeah, but I think we should do
the mega-happy ending.

01:29:09.094 --> 01:29:11.762
Oh, the mega-happy ending.
That's doable.

01:29:30.615 --> 01:29:32.992
Hi. I'm Frankie Sharp, Sharp Records.

01:29:33.368 --> 01:29:35.286
I saw your performance in my limo.

01:29:35.370 --> 01:29:37.288
I must tell you, it was terrific.

01:29:37.372 --> 01:29:40.207
-Yeah. All right.
-In fact, I think it's so good,

01:29:40.751 --> 01:29:43.044
I'm gonna give you a six-album deal,
starting tomorrow.

01:29:43.128 --> 01:29:45.254
-Yes.
-See you in my office.

01:29:46.173 --> 01:29:49.383
-I love you, Wayne.
-I love you, Cassandra.

01:29:53.055 --> 01:29:56.057
-I love you, Garth.
-I love you, dream woman.

01:29:58.435 --> 01:30:00.061
You know, ever since I did your show,

01:30:00.145 --> 01:30:02.646
kids are looking at me
in a whole new way.

01:30:03.231 --> 01:30:06.108
-I love you, man.
-And I love you,

01:30:06.193 --> 01:30:11.072
because I've learned that platonic love
can exist between two grown men.

01:30:12.032 --> 01:30:13.991
And I've learned something, too.

01:30:14.076 --> 01:30:16.577
I've learned that a flawless profile,

01:30:16.661 --> 01:30:19.455
a perfect body, the right clothes
and a great car

01:30:19.539 --> 01:30:22.458
can get you far in America,
almost to the top,

01:30:22.542 --> 01:30:25.044
but it can't get you everything.

01:30:26.338 --> 01:30:29.298
Isn’t it great that we're all better people?

01:30:30.425 --> 01:30:32.218
-Fished in!
-Fished in!

01:30:32.302 --> 01:30:34.303
Fished in!

01:30:36.431 --> 01:30:37.556
Fished in!

01:31:24.396 --> 01:31:27.815
-All right, excellent movie. All right.
-Yeah. Good one.

01:31:27.899 --> 01:31:30.693
All right. Well, that's all the time
we have for our movie.

01:31:30.777 --> 01:31:32.903
We hope you found it entertaining,

01:31:33.446 --> 01:31:35.030
whimsical and yet relevant,

01:31:35.115 --> 01:31:36.949
with an underlying revisionist conceit

01:31:37.033 --> 01:31:41.203
that belied the film's emotional
attachments to the subject matter.

01:31:41.913 --> 01:31:44.748
I just hope you didn't think it sucked.

01:31:45.333 --> 01:31:48.335
Okay. So, thank you for coming.
Good night and party on.

01:31:48.420 --> 01:31:50.254
-Party on, Wayne.
-Party on, Garth.

01:33:57.632 --> 01:34:01.552
You know, I don't think
anyone's gonna tell us when to leave.

01:34:02.304 --> 01:34:04.221
Yeah, good call, Garth.

01:34:04.556 --> 01:34:06.640
I'll bet we're just gonna sit here,

01:34:06.725 --> 01:34:10.019
and when they're finished,
they'll fade to black.

01:34:14.149 --> 01:34:15.816
I can't believe they did that.

01:34:15.900 --> 01:34:17.900
I told you.
