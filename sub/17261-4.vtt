HOW?

00:15.557 --> 00:16.933

I'VE BEEN PRAYING FOR A CUTE GUY
TO MOVE IN ACROSS THE STREET,

00:37.537 --> 00:38.830
AND A CUTE GUY DID MOVE IN
ACROSS THE STREET,

00:38.913 --> 00:40.123
SO GOD GAVE HIM TO ME.

00:40.206 --> 00:42.333

SHIRTLESS CONTRACTOR.

- WELL, I'M NOT READY TO GET
BACK TO ANYTHING SERIOUS,

00:52.510 --> 00:55.388
BUT MAYBE A LITTLE FLING
TO GET ME STARTED.

- YEAH, YEAH, I GET IT.
LIKE THE FIRST WAFFLE.

00:59.601 --> 01:02.437
- WAFFLE?
- YEAH, WHEN YOU MAKE WAFFLES,

01:02.520 --> 01:06.357
THE FIRST ONE'S NEVER A KEEPER
SO YOU THROW IT OUT, AND--

01:06.441 --> 01:08.485
EVERY ONE AFTER THAT
JUST SEEMS BETTER.

01:08.568 --> 01:10.320
- OH.

I THINK I MIGHT HAVE BEEN THAT
WAFFLE TO A FEW MEN.

- OH, HEY, VICTORIA, HOW'D THE
FIRST DAY ON YOUR NEW SHOW GO?

01:16.785 --> 01:18.453
- IT WAS TERRIFYING.

01:18.536 --> 01:20.163
I STILL DON'T KNOW WHAT THIS
SHOW IS ABOUT

01:20.246 --> 01:22.457
OR HOW TO PLAY MY CHARACTER.

THAT IT WAS A FLUKE.

01:52.278 --> 01:56.658
GOD, IT WAS SO MUCH EASIER DOING
LIFETIME ORIGINAL MOVIES.

ABOUT MY CHARACTER

A BAD IDEA.

NOT A PROBLEM.

WELL, IT'S NO BIG DEAL,
IT'S JUST FLESH.

09:39.453 --> 09:43.291
IS THERE ANY CHANCE YOU LIKED
WHAT YOU SAW?

09:43.374 --> 09:45.501
- WHAT?

09:45.584 --> 09:47.003
NO, I DIDN'T LIKE IT.

09:47.086 --> 09:49.005
IT WAS WEIRD.

09:49.088 --> 09:50.006
- WEIRD?

09:50.089 --> 09:52.675
WELL, WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?

09:52.758 --> 09:55.344
- DO YOU HAVE ANYTHING UNUSUAL
GOING ON UNDER YOUR CLOTHES?

09:55.428 --> 09:58.055
- NO. I LOOK GOOD UNDER MY
CLOTHES.

09:58.139 --> 10:01.017
- MAYBE HE SAW YOUR MOLE MASS.

10:01.100 --> 10:04.186
- IT'S NOT A MOLE MASS!
IT'S THREE MOLES.

10:04.270 --> 10:06.063
MY MOM SAID THEY WERE ANGEL
KISSES.

10:06.147 --> 10:09.358
- THOSE ANGELS HAD SOME BIG ASS
LIPS.

10:15.656 --> 10:17.825
- ALRIGHT, MELANIE. I NEED YOU
TO TALK TO ZED ABOUT THE SHOW.

10:17.908 --> 10:19.994
NOW, I CAN'T DO IT,
HE'LL FIRE ME.

10:20.077 --> 10:23.164
HE JUST FIRED BEN KINGSLEY
FOR ASKING TOO MANY QUESTIONS.

10:23.247 --> 10:24.040
- I CAN'T TALK TO ZED UNTIL

10:24.123 --> 10:27.043
I FIND OUT WHAT JACK MEANT BY
"WEIRD."

10:27.126 --> 10:28.544
[phone chimes]

10:28.627 --> 10:31.756
- LOOK, I GOT ANOTHER SINDER
MATCH.

10:31.839 --> 10:34.675
OF ALL THE GUYS WITH FACE
TATTOOS, HE SEEMS THE NICEST.

10:39.263 --> 10:40.765
- JACK?
- HEY.

10:40.848 --> 10:45.394
- SO, UM, JOY TELLS ME THAT YOU
MAY HAVE SEEN SOMETHING WEIRD

10:45.478 --> 10:47.855
THROUGH OUR WINDOW THIS MORNING.

10:47.938 --> 10:49.398
- YES, UNFORTUNATELY I DID.

10:49.482 --> 10:51.108
- WAS IT REALLY THAT BAD?

10:51.192 --> 10:54.737
- TRULY UNSETTLING.

10:54.820 --> 10:57.114
NO GOOD PLACE TO LOOK,
YOU KNOW?

10:57.198 --> 10:59.075
- NO GOOD PLACE?

10:59.158 --> 11:00.659
- IN A WORD, "UGH!"

11:02.495 --> 11:04.163
- "ICK?"
- MM.

11:07.500 --> 11:09.919
- HAVE YOU SEEN
COUNCILMAN STOKES?

11:10.002 --> 11:12.755
- HELLO, ELKA.

11:12.838 --> 11:15.091
- OH, COUNCILMAN STOKES.

11:15.174 --> 11:17.551
LIFE OF THE PARTY.

11:17.635 --> 11:19.637
- HELLO, I'M VICTORIA CHASE.

11:19.720 --> 11:22.264
- I KNOW I SAW YOU
IN <i> CLEVELAND RHAPSODY.</i>

11:22.348 --> 11:24.600
IT WAS THE NIGHT MY FIANCEE
AND I BROKE UP.

11:24.683 --> 11:28.813
I'M SORRY BUT SEEING YOU IS
BRINGING BACK VERY BAD MEMORIES.

11:28.896 --> 11:33.275
- TRY SEEING HER EVERY DAY.

11:33.359 --> 11:34.944
GET LOST, VICTORIA.

11:36.320 --> 11:38.239
- MAYBE I SHOULD GO TOO.

11:38.322 --> 11:40.658
- WITH ALL THE SINGLE WOMEN
AT THIS PARTY?

11:40.741 --> 11:42.284
HERE COMES ONE NOW.

11:42.368 --> 11:44.787
- CAN YOU BELIEVE HE SAW MY
NAKED BODY

11:44.870 --> 11:46.956
AND ALL HE COULD SAY WAS "ICK?"

11:47.039 --> 11:49.500
IT MUST HAVE BEEN MY MOLE MASS.

11:51.419 --> 11:53.587
- WHO ELSE YOU GOT?

11:55.047 --> 11:57.800
- SO, ZED, I LIKE YOUR TOP.

11:57.883 --> 12:02.263
UM, TUNIC. MAN-SHIRT.
I LIKE YOUR MAN-SHIRT.

12:02.346 --> 12:04.932
- SO, I UNDERSTAND YOU HAVE SOME
QUESTIONS ABOUT MY SHOW.

12:05.015 --> 12:08.936
- YES. I DO. BUT, BEFORE WE GET
TO THAT, UM,

12:09.019 --> 12:12.314
IF YOU WERE DIRECTING A SCENE
WHERE A MAN SEES A NAKED WOMAN

12:12.398 --> 12:16.735
{\an1}THROUGH A WINDOW, AND THAT WOMAN
JUST HAPPENED TO LOOK LIKE ME,

12:16.819 --> 12:20.156
WOULD THAT MAN'S REACTION EVER
BE "ICK?"

12:20.239 --> 12:21.866
- NO WAY.
THAT WOULDN'T HAPPEN.

12:21.949 --> 12:23.325
YOU'RE TOO BEAUTIFUL.

12:23.409 --> 12:25.828
- OH, ZED, THANK YOU.

12:25.911 --> 12:28.831
BUT, IF IT DID HAPPEN.

12:28.914 --> 12:30.458
- WELL, THEN THE LIGHTING
WAS WRONG.

12:30.541 --> 12:33.461
IMPROPER LIGHTING CAN ABSOLUTELY
DEMOLISH BEAUTY.

12:33.544 --> 12:34.545
- REALLY?

12:34.628 --> 12:35.838
WELL, CAN YOU
COME INTO MY BEDROOM

12:35.921 --> 12:39.633
AND LOOK AT ME AT EVERY ANGLE?

12:39.717 --> 12:42.887
WE CAN TEST OUT DIFFERENT
POSITIONS.

12:42.970 --> 12:44.763
I MIGHT EVEN DANCE A LITTLE.

12:49.059 --> 12:52.354
- YEAH, YEAH, OKAY,
I'M GAME.

12:52.438 --> 12:55.566
I'LL GO GET US SOME DRINKS.

12:58.777 --> 13:01.864
- I GUESS WHAT I'M LOOKING FOR
IS A GIRL WHO'S SMART,

13:01.947 --> 13:05.826
AND SWEET, MAYBE A LITTLE SHY.

13:05.910 --> 13:07.828
- I SEE WHERE YOU'RE GOING BUT--

13:07.912 --> 13:12.208
I DON'T DATE COWORKERS.
- [chuckles]

13:12.291 --> 13:14.210
WHAT I'M LOOKING FOR DOESN'T
EXIST ANYMORE.

13:14.293 --> 13:17.087
AND OLD FASHIONED GIRL
WITH OLD FASHIONED VALUES.

13:18.797 --> 13:21.217
- I KNOW JUST THE GIRL.

13:21.300 --> 13:24.303
- YOU SAID I WAS A DEMURE
ENGLISH ROSE?

13:24.386 --> 13:26.096
- AND VIRGIN.

13:26.180 --> 13:28.557
NOW GO SELL IT.

13:28.641 --> 13:30.893
- I AM TIRED OF YOU
PIMPING ME OUT.

13:30.976 --> 13:32.728
- IT'S NOT PIMPING.

13:32.811 --> 13:35.231
I'M ASKING YOU
NOT TO SLEEP WITH HIM.

13:35.314 --> 13:38.359
FOR CLEVELAND.

13:38.442 --> 13:41.904
- WELL, I GUESS YOU DID SAVE THE
DOG PARKS AND

13:41.987 --> 13:44.365
BRING A LOT OF JOBS
TO THE CITY.

13:44.448 --> 13:45.866
AND YOU'VE DONE A LOT
FOR THE ZOO.

13:45.950 --> 13:49.453
- I NAMED THAT OLD BABOON
AFTER YOU.

13:49.537 --> 13:51.413
- YOU SAID IT WAS
A BABY SNOW LEOPARD.

13:51.497 --> 13:52.957
- OH, THAT'S RIGHT.

13:58.379 --> 14:00.965
- AND WHEN I SAW <i> 40 YEAR OLD</i>
<i>VIRGIN</i> I THOUGHT,

14:01.048 --> 14:04.843
"FINALLY, SOMEONE'S TELLING
MY STORY."

14:07.346 --> 14:10.808
- ELKA WAS RIGHT, YOU REALLY ARE
A DEMURE ENGLISH ROSE.

14:10.891 --> 14:15.104
- OH, COUNCILMAN. YOU MAKE ME
BLUSH.

14:15.187 --> 14:17.773
MAYBE IT MAKES ME OLD FASHIONED

14:17.856 --> 14:20.734
BUT I GUESS I'M JUST A GIRL
LOOKING FOR LOVE.

14:20.818 --> 14:24.738
SOMEONE TO LIVE HAPPILY EVER
AFTER WITH.

14:24.822 --> 14:29.451
WHITE PICKET FENCE. KIDS AND
DOGS PLAYING IN THE YARD.

14:29.535 --> 14:31.745
- THAT SOUNDS REALLY NICE.

14:31.829 --> 14:33.956
- IT DOES, DOESN'T IT?

14:34.039 --> 14:36.458
- THE PROBLEM IN THE REAL WORLD
IS PEOPLE JUST WANT TO

14:36.542 --> 14:38.335
HOOKUP ON TINDER.

14:38.419 --> 14:40.796
OR WORSE, SINDER.

14:40.879 --> 14:42.840
THANK GOD YOU'RE NOTHING
LIKE THAT.

14:42.923 --> 14:45.718
SEX WITHOUT LOVE, HA,
IT'S JUST SAD!

14:47.219 --> 14:50.180
[saxophone playing]

14:50.264 --> 14:51.974
- OH, DEAR GOD.

14:52.057 --> 14:54.351
- WHY IS THERE A MAN IN YOUR
DRIVEWAY PLAYING SAXOPHONE?

14:54.435 --> 14:55.811
- LET'S GO INSIDE.

14:57.855 --> 14:58.814
- WHO WAS THAT?

14:58.897 --> 15:00.441
- I HAVE NO IDEA.

15:00.524 --> 15:02.109
LET ME SHOW YOU THE BACK GARDEN.

15:02.192 --> 15:03.819
- JOY!

15:03.902 --> 15:06.280
I KNOW THIS MORNING YOU SAID YOU
WERE JUST USING ME FOR SEX

15:06.363 --> 15:08.824
BUT I HAVE FEELINGS.

15:08.907 --> 15:10.492
I'M NOT A PIECE OF MEAT.

15:12.494 --> 15:13.996
- I THOUGHT HE WAS A WAFFLE.

15:19.126 --> 15:21.629
- YOU SLEPT WITH THIS MAN
THIS MORNING?

15:21.712 --> 15:25.132
- I'LL SAY. WITH THE CURTAINS
WIDE OPEN.

15:25.215 --> 15:26.842
- WHAT?

15:26.925 --> 15:29.011
- LIKE I WAS TELLING YOU,
I SAW JOY AND MY CONTRACTOR

15:29.094 --> 15:31.597
THROUGH THE WINDOW.
ICK!

15:31.680 --> 15:34.183
- OH, SO SHE'S THE ICK?
NOT ME?

15:34.266 --> 15:36.894
OH, JOY, DID YOU HEAR THAT?
I'M NOT THE ICK, YOU ARE!

15:38.896 --> 15:40.564
- YES, I HEARD.

15:40.648 --> 15:43.609
I'M AWASH IN WONDERFUL NEWS
HERE.

15:43.692 --> 15:46.528
- MELANIE, YOU COULD NEVER BE
THE ICK. YOU'RE BEAUTIFUL.

15:46.612 --> 15:49.073
IN FACT, I WAS WORKING UP THE
COURAGE TO ASK YOU OUT

15:49.156 --> 15:50.366
FOR A COFFEE.

15:50.449 --> 15:51.700
- OH, I'D LOVE THAT.

15:51.784 --> 15:55.537
- WHOA, WHOA, WHOA, WHOA, WHOA,
HEY, UH--

15:55.621 --> 15:58.207
WHAT'S GOING ON? YOU JUST
INVITED ME UP TO YOUR BEDROOM.

15:58.290 --> 16:00.250
- WELL, YES, BUT JUST SO YOU
COULD LIGHT ME.

16:00.334 --> 16:02.503
- BUT YOU TALKED ABOUT HOW YOU
LOOKED NAKED!

16:02.586 --> 16:06.006
AND THAT YOU WANTED TO TEST OUT
DIFFERENT POSITIONS!

16:06.090 --> 16:07.925
THOSE THINGS MEAN SOMETHING
TO A MAN!

16:10.010 --> 16:12.346
I GUESS YOU ARE AS DUMB AS
VICTORIA SAID.

16:12.429 --> 16:14.348
- HEY, HOLD ON, ZED.

16:14.431 --> 16:16.684
NOW I CAN CALL MELANIE DUMB,
BUT YOU CAN'T.

16:16.767 --> 16:19.353
- YEAH, I'D RATHER NOBODY
CALLED ME DUMB.

16:19.436 --> 16:21.897
- MELANIE'S NOT DUMB,
SHE'S WONDERFUL.

16:21.980 --> 16:24.817
YOU KNOW WHAT'S DUMB?
YOU AND YOUR SHOWS.

16:24.900 --> 16:28.070
THEY WIN AWARDS BUT THEY DON'T
MAKE A LICK OF SENSE.

16:28.153 --> 16:30.614
- THAT'S HIM TALKING, NOT ME.
BUT GO ON.

16:30.698 --> 16:33.075
- WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?
MY SHOWS MAKE PERFECT SENSE.

16:33.158 --> 16:34.118
TELL THEM, VICTORIA.

16:34.201 --> 16:39.748
- UH, THERE ARE BIG SCENES,
AND LITTLE ONES--

16:39.832 --> 16:40.958
OH, SCREW IT!

16:41.041 --> 16:43.460
I HAVE NO IDEA WHAT YOUR SCRIPT
IS ABOUT

16:43.544 --> 16:45.587
OR HOW THE HELL I'M SUPPOSED TO
BE PLAYING IT.

16:45.671 --> 16:47.589
- BUT, YOU SAID YOU LOVED IT.

16:47.673 --> 16:49.925
- BECAUSE I DIDN'T WANT TO
SEEM STUPID.

16:50.008 --> 16:54.388
BUT I AM STUPID, AND YOUR SCRIPT
MADE ME THAT WAY.

16:54.471 --> 16:56.932
NOW, JUST TELL ME YES OR NO,

16:57.015 --> 17:00.185
AM I A GHOST DETECTIVE
TRYING TO GO BACK IN TIME

17:00.269 --> 17:02.771
TO SOLVE MY OWN MURDER?

17:02.855 --> 17:04.897
- NOT EVEN CLOSE.

17:06.233 --> 17:09.111
- TOO BAD, I'D WATCH THAT.
- YEAH, ME TOO.

17:14.407 --> 17:16.326
- ULTIMATELY, THIS IS A STORY
IN WHICH THE ACTION

17:16.410 --> 17:19.663
TRIES TO FIND MEANING IN
INACTION!

17:21.832 --> 17:24.626
WAIT, EARLIER YOU MENTIONED THAT
YOU'RE A GHOST

17:24.710 --> 17:27.628
TRYING TO SOLVE YOUR OWN MURDER?

17:27.713 --> 17:29.631
I LIKE THAT, WHY DON'T WE JUST
DO THAT?

17:31.884 --> 17:33.927
- OKAY.

17:34.011 --> 17:35.053
OH, I AM SO RELIEVED.

17:35.137 --> 17:37.473
I THOUGHT YOU WERE GOING TO FIRE
ME FOR ASKING QUESTIONS

17:37.556 --> 17:39.099
THE WAY YOU DID WITH BEN
KINGSLEY.

17:39.183 --> 17:40.642
- NO, THAT WAS JUST
THE TIPPING POINT.

17:40.726 --> 17:43.812
THE REAL ISSUE WAS THAT EVERY
MORNING ON SET,

17:43.896 --> 17:46.273
HE WOULD TAKE THE LAST
EVERYTHING BAGEL.

17:48.567 --> 17:50.319
- WELL, I DON'T EAT BAGELS.

17:50.402 --> 17:51.695
AND I CERTAINLY DON'T EAT
ANYTHING

17:51.779 --> 17:53.614
THAT HAS THE WORD
"EVERYTHING" IN IT.

17:54.782 --> 17:56.533
- EXCELLENT.

17:56.617 --> 17:58.619
AND VICTORIA?

17:58.702 --> 18:00.871
DON'T EVER FEEL STUPID AGAIN.

18:00.954 --> 18:05.042
WHAT YOU SHOULD BE IS OUTWARDLY
VAIN, BUT INWARDLY WARM.

18:05.125 --> 18:07.795
FEARFUL BUT WISE.

18:07.878 --> 18:10.506
DRIVEN BUT GENEROUS.

18:10.589 --> 18:12.216
- WHO COULD BE ALL THOSE THINGS?

18:12.299 --> 18:14.343
SHE SOUNDS LIKE A COMPLETE MESS.

18:14.426 --> 18:17.346
- I WAS DESCRIBING YOU.

18:17.429 --> 18:19.181
I MEANT YOU SHOULD
JUST BE YOURSELF.

18:19.264 --> 18:22.142
THIS CHARACTER IS YOU.

18:22.226 --> 18:25.020
- OH, MY GOD,

18:25.103 --> 18:28.816
I AM SO COMPLEX I-I BARELY
UNDERSTAND MYSELF.

18:30.943 --> 18:32.027
- YEAH, JUST BE LIKE THAT.

18:36.156 --> 18:39.326
- LOOK, I KNOW ELKA INVITED ME
HERE TO GET MY VOTE

18:39.409 --> 18:41.703
AND ASKED YOU TO PRETEND TO BE
SOMEONE YOU'RE OBVIOUSLY NOT.

18:41.787 --> 18:44.540
- YOU'RE RIGHT, BUT,
THE TRUTH IS

18:44.623 --> 18:46.959
WHEN I WAS SAYING I BELIEVED IN
HAPPILY EVER AFTER

18:47.042 --> 18:48.877
I REALIZED, I MEANT IT.

18:48.961 --> 18:51.380
I MEAN, DEEP DOWN,
THAT'S WHO I AM.

18:51.463 --> 18:53.590
I'VE BEEN DOING THIS STUPID
STUFF BECAUSE

18:53.674 --> 18:55.467
I RECENTLY HAD MY HEART BROKEN

18:55.551 --> 18:57.594
AND I'M SCARED OF IT
HAPPENING AGAIN.

18:57.678 --> 18:59.221
- I UNDERSTAND.

18:59.304 --> 19:02.182
YOU GET TO AN AGE WHERE YOU JUST
SORT OF GIVE UP AND SAY

19:02.266 --> 19:03.350
"WHAT'S THE POINT?"

19:03.433 --> 19:05.060
- WELL, YOU COULD BE LIKE ELKA.

19:05.144 --> 19:08.355
SHE'S 92 AND NEVER USES HER AGE

19:08.438 --> 19:10.399
AS AN EXCUSE NOT TO DO
SOMETHING.

19:10.482 --> 19:13.235
RUN FOR OFFICE,
LOOK FOR LOVE,

19:13.318 --> 19:15.237
MANIPULATE HER FRIENDS.
- [chuckles]

19:15.320 --> 19:17.865
SHE KNOWS HOW TO WORK IT.

19:17.948 --> 19:22.244
AND YOU DO NEED THAT IN ORDER
TO GET THINGS DONE FOR A CITY.

19:22.327 --> 19:24.872
- SO, DOES SHE GET YOUR VOTE?

19:24.955 --> 19:25.914
- I GUESS SHE DOES.

19:25.998 --> 19:29.877
- FINALLY.

19:29.960 --> 19:33.589
I MEAN, IS THERE ANYTHING WE
SHOULD BE CELEBRATING?

19:35.841 --> 19:38.427
- WOW, WHAT A MIX-UP.
- YEAH.

19:38.510 --> 19:40.804
- THIS WOULD BE A STORY
WE'RE TELLING THE KIDS.

19:40.888 --> 19:42.431
- KIDS?

19:42.514 --> 19:43.557
- NOT OURS.

19:43.640 --> 19:48.103
JUST YOUNG PEOPLE WHO--

19:48.186 --> 19:50.606
LIKE CHARMING STORIES ABOUT
COUPLES MEETING.

19:50.689 --> 19:52.482
- [laughs]

19:52.566 --> 19:56.445
- WELL I SHOULD GET GOING.

19:56.528 --> 20:00.115
YOU KNOW, IN NEW ZEALAND WE HAVE
A TRADITION.

20:00.198 --> 20:02.618
WHEN YOU SAY GOODNIGHT TO
SOMEONE AND YOU LIKE THAT PERSON

20:02.701 --> 20:03.619
GIVE THEM A KISS.

20:03.702 --> 20:06.246
- OH, WE HAVE A SIMILAR
TRADITION IN AMERICA.

20:06.330 --> 20:08.457
- OH, YOU DO?
GOOD.

20:08.540 --> 20:11.668
WELL, PREPARE YOURSELF FOR A
RESPECTFUL, YET SENSUAL,

20:11.752 --> 20:12.920
KISS ON THE CHEEK.

20:14.713 --> 20:16.673
- OKAY, GO FOR IT.

20:20.886 --> 20:22.387
