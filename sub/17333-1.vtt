Ghost Patrol time!

[faint bells ringing]

01:26.044 --> 01:28.255
It's in there! It's in there!

01:28.338 --> 01:29.798
[girl] The ghost? You saw it?

01:29.881 --> 01:34.011
I heard it.
I felt its presence, its very being.

01:34.386 --> 01:37.931
And then, I could sense it
coming toward me,

01:38.015 --> 01:40.809
its ghostly vapor reaching out.

01:41.393 --> 01:42.686
Then what did you do?

01:43.437 --> 01:46.398
Are you kidding?
I got my aura outta there!

01:46.481 --> 01:48.358
I'm not sticking around
where there's a ghost.

01:48.442 --> 01:51.778
You did the right thing.
We'll take it from here. Let's go, Spence.

01:52.446 --> 01:53.322
Hold it, Gabi.

01:53.405 --> 01:55.657
We need to scan for evidence
of paranormal activity,

01:55.741 --> 01:58.327
and see if there's any fluctuations
in the magnetic, electric,

01:58.410 --> 01:59.745
and atmospheric energy levels.

01:59.828 --> 02:03.123
Lemme know how that works out for you.
Come on, Spooky!

02:14.134 --> 02:16.845
Here ghostie, ghostie, ghostie.

02:16.928 --> 02:19.681
Come out, come out wherever you are.

02:20.349 --> 02:21.183
Hmm.

02:22.601 --> 02:23.602
[sniffing]

02:24.394 --> 02:25.228

02:25.520 --> 02:26.521
Good boy, Spooky.

02:27.439 --> 02:28.315
[device beeping]

02:28.774 --> 02:30.567
Atmospheric readings are abnormal.

02:30.651 --> 02:32.569
Definitely temperature fluctuations.

02:33.236 --> 02:36.698
-We've got a ghost!
-No, we've got a <i>reading,</i>

02:36.782 --> 02:39.242
which could be caused
by the greenhouse conditions.

02:39.326 --> 02:41.620
Or... by a ghost.

02:41.703 --> 02:44.748
Check this out-- a ghost whistle!
I just got it yesterday.

02:44.831 --> 02:48.377
It's supposed to disturb the spirits.

02:48.585 --> 02:49.586

02:55.217 --> 02:57.010
Okay, that's disturbing everyone.

03:00.722 --> 03:01.556
[shutter whirrs, clicks]

03:02.557 --> 03:05.018
Hmm. I don't see anything.

03:05.102 --> 03:08.647
So our ghost is invisible.
But not for long.

03:09.523 --> 03:11.066
I'll dust it and bust it!

03:11.149 --> 03:14.653
Then I'll zap it and trap it. Oh, yeah.

03:16.488 --> 03:17.823

-I got it!

[all screaming]

03:31.294 --> 03:32.462
[all]
Ooh!

03:33.880 --> 03:35.090
What's that?

03:35.173 --> 03:37.634
My Ghost-Zapper.
It disrupts magnetic energy.

03:37.718 --> 03:40.512
If the ghost tries to escape,
this'll hold it in place.

03:41.221 --> 03:43.265
At least, that's what it's supposed to do.

03:43.348 --> 03:45.684
Say cheese, you slimy spirit!

03:48.979 --> 03:50.230
[meows]

03:51.064 --> 03:52.566

03:52.649 --> 03:55.777
Oh, there you are, you naughty kitty.

03:55.861 --> 03:57.779
Where have you been, hmm?

03:57.863 --> 03:58.864
[coos]

04:00.115 --> 04:02.909
Miss Whiskers has been missing
for over a week.

04:02.993 --> 04:08.582
This is much better than finding a ghost.
Thank you so much, Ghost Patrol.

04:09.040 --> 04:10.041
[clapping]

04:11.126 --> 04:12.461
Say cheese!

04:12.544 --> 04:13.378
[shutter clicks]

04:16.423 --> 04:18.550
They once found an armadillo in my pantry.

04:18.633 --> 04:20.177
[clicks, whines]

04:20.260 --> 04:21.720
[beeps]

04:22.971 --> 04:26.475
[sighs] Environmental readings
are back to normal.

04:27.225 --> 04:28.059

04:29.227 --> 04:30.228
[whimpers]

04:36.067 --> 04:37.486
[sighs]

04:37.569 --> 04:38.945
Come on, Spooky.

04:40.489 --> 04:43.825
Well, that didn't turn out
the way we thought. Again.

04:43.909 --> 04:45.994
Aw, come on. Didn't you get great data?

04:46.077 --> 04:47.788
And weren't the readings
out of the ordinary?

04:48.538 --> 04:50.040
Yeah, but not because of a ghost.

04:50.123 --> 04:51.917
Hey, just because we found a cat,

04:52.000 --> 04:54.336
doesn't mean there wasn't a ghost
in there too.

04:54.419 --> 04:56.046
-Well...
-Exactly!

04:56.129 --> 04:58.507
So you agree that there
could have been a ghost there.

04:58.590 --> 05:01.301
Did I? Based on the evidence,
I'd have to say...

05:03.470 --> 05:04.304
Maybe.

05:04.387 --> 05:07.432
And that's the third "maybe" this month!

05:07.516 --> 05:09.017
[Gabi] We're closing in on those ghosts.

05:11.186 --> 05:12.604
[ringtone chiming]

05:15.023 --> 05:17.651
<i>Marco, the Ghost Patrol struck again.</i>

05:18.527 --> 05:19.528
[laughs]

05:20.487 --> 05:22.447
They're so busted!

05:22.697 --> 05:23.865
[laughing]

05:24.908 --> 05:26.952
[Spence] Um, guys...?

05:28.495 --> 05:32.499
Oh, hey, baby brother.
Saw you found a big scary cat!

05:32.582 --> 05:34.000
Ooh!

05:34.376 --> 05:37.837
What a cat-tastrophe.
Looks like you really blew it!

05:38.213 --> 05:39.297
[Marco, sister laughing]

05:40.840 --> 05:43.677
Bet you're "feline" pretty silly
right about now.

05:43.760 --> 05:46.012
Marco, you have a hair out of place.

05:46.096 --> 05:46.930
[gasps]

05:47.389 --> 05:50.100
Seriously, could you dweebs get any lamer?

05:50.183 --> 05:52.102
-Hashtag "embarrassing."
-[keypad clicking]

05:52.185 --> 05:56.064
Harper, aren't you even the least bit
curious about supernatural phenomena?

05:56.147 --> 05:56.982
Sure.

05:57.065 --> 06:01.736
I'm curious how I can be so cool
but related to someone who's so <i>not.</i>

06:01.820 --> 06:04.155
Sis, why don't you two just admit

06:04.239 --> 06:06.950
there's no such thing as ghosts?
[chuckles]

06:07.033 --> 06:08.410
[Marco] Even I know that.

06:09.828 --> 06:11.371
-Hi, Mom.
-Hey, Mrs. Flores.

06:11.454 --> 06:13.623
Hello, Gabriella. Hi, Spence.

06:14.791 --> 06:15.625
[Mrs. Flores grunts]

06:15.709 --> 06:17.002
Find any ghosts today?

06:17.961 --> 06:21.381
-No, I guess not.
-None that we can prove, anyway.

06:21.464 --> 06:24.634
-Hmm. Maybe next time.
-Pff. Unlikely.

06:24.718 --> 06:25.635
Marco...

06:25.719 --> 06:28.597
Sorry, Mom, but I just can't
with this ghost stuff.

06:28.680 --> 06:31.725
It's so embarrassing.
I'm losing followers!

06:31.808 --> 06:34.853
Come on, Marco. Let's just go.
Bye, Mrs. Flores.

06:34.978 --> 06:37.105
Bye, Cat Patrol.
[meows]

06:37.772 --> 06:40.817
Mom, you and Dad believe in ghosts, right?

06:41.401 --> 06:45.947
Well, I do agree there are things
in this world that we can't explain...

06:46.031 --> 06:49.451
like my boss deciding to put Geist Manor
back on the market.

06:49.534 --> 06:52.537
If I want to keep my job,
I'm the one who has to sell it.

06:52.621 --> 06:55.957
What's the problem? Geist Manor's
the coolest building in town.

06:56.041 --> 06:58.418
It's practically a historical landmark.

06:58.501 --> 07:01.504
It's got everything!
It's old, it's creepy,

07:01.588 --> 07:04.090
and it's probably chock-full of ghosts!

07:04.174 --> 07:07.010
Ghosts? In a house I'm supposed to sell?

07:07.093 --> 07:10.221
Unsubstantiated.
We've never actually been inside.

07:10.305 --> 07:12.557
-Yet!
-Don't even think about it!

07:12.641 --> 07:14.100
I have enough to worry about.

07:14.184 --> 07:16.144
Like trying to sell a house
with bad plumbing,

07:16.227 --> 07:18.480
faulty electricity
and a roof that leaks.

07:19.356 --> 07:22.317
Along with trying to sell
all the other houses on my list.

07:22.400 --> 07:24.986
You can do it.
You could sell water to a fish!

07:25.070 --> 07:28.239
-Or something like that.
-Oh, thanks, sweetie.

07:28.323 --> 07:29.157
I try.

07:29.783 --> 07:33.203
Maybe what the house needs
is just a little TLC.

07:33.286 --> 07:34.120
[chuckles]

07:34.329 --> 07:38.166
A lot of TLC. A dump truck of TLC.

07:39.417 --> 07:42.253
Mom! Dad! I'm going to Gabi's.

07:42.337 --> 07:44.339
[Dad] Okay, not too late, please.

07:46.174 --> 07:49.177
[narrator] <i>We're now entering the attic</i>
<i>of the old saw mill.</i>

07:49.260 --> 07:51.721
<i>Will we find the spirit</i>
<i>of Old Man Mackenzie?</i>

07:52.514 --> 07:54.683
-Watching <i>Ghost Search</i> again?
-Yeah.

07:54.766 --> 07:56.935
I don't know why. They never find any.

07:57.519 --> 07:59.062
But I know they're out there.

07:59.646 --> 08:01.272
But how do you know?

08:01.356 --> 08:03.400
A lot of people say
they see ghosts,

08:03.483 --> 08:05.110
but no one's ever been able to prove it.

08:05.193 --> 08:07.112
Right. And?

08:07.195 --> 08:08.071
Think about it.

08:08.154 --> 08:11.783
Every picture ever taken
of a ghost is either out of focus,

08:11.866 --> 08:14.035
or so badly shot
you can't tell what it is.

08:14.119 --> 08:15.036
Exactly!

08:15.120 --> 08:18.373
That means we could be the first
to get definitive photographic evidence.

08:19.708 --> 08:20.875
I would love that.

08:21.376 --> 08:25.005
But I have to wonder why we always
come close to seeing a ghost, but don't.

08:25.088 --> 08:29.009
-Because of the conspiracy!
-Not this again.

08:29.092 --> 08:30.969
Just like Area 51.

08:31.052 --> 08:32.929
They've had alien spacecrafts
for decades,

08:33.013 --> 08:34.639
but won't let anyone see them!

08:36.975 --> 08:40.020
Of course
they'd be hiding ghosts from us!

08:40.103 --> 08:42.022
And "they" are...?

08:42.981 --> 08:43.982
The government!

08:44.983 --> 08:47.235
[whispers] It's always the government.

08:47.318 --> 08:50.530
-And you're basing your theory on...?
-Eh, gut instinct.

08:50.613 --> 08:52.198
Well, that's scientific.

08:52.282 --> 08:54.242
Hey, when you're right, you're right.

08:54.325 --> 08:55.160
We'll see.

09:51.966 --> 09:54.511
[Spence] It was bats. Again.

09:54.594 --> 09:56.137
But who put them there?

09:56.221 --> 09:58.431
I don't know.

09:58.515 --> 10:00.934
-Ha, ha.

Your mom's sign.

10:13.196 --> 10:16.574
-Yeah, so?
-Not that! In the window!

10:16.658 --> 10:19.994
I just saw something that looked...
[gasps] ghostly.

10:20.078 --> 10:23.373
Probably just a curtain blowing
in the wind. Or a cat.

10:23.456 --> 10:24.999
Hey, I know what I saw.

10:25.583 --> 10:30.088
Gabi, maybe you want to see a ghost
so badly you're making yourself-- huh?

10:31.381 --> 10:32.590
Wait. I just saw it too!

10:32.674 --> 10:35.218
-Second floor, third window on the left?
-Yes!

10:35.301 --> 10:37.762
-It looked kind of...
-Ghostly?

10:54.946 --> 10:57.073
Definitely atmospheric disturbances.

10:57.157 --> 10:59.617
And the electromagnetic energy is spiking!

10:59.701 --> 11:02.287
-Yes! I knew this place was haunted.
-[scanner clicks]

11:02.370 --> 11:05.623

-And now, I'm right.

11:05.707 --> 11:06.833
Gabi!

11:06.916 --> 11:08.835
[Spence] We haven't even found
anything yet.

12:04.098 --> 12:05.308
[squeaks]

12:05.391 --> 12:10.146
Colonel Walter Geist.
Oh, he's the guy who built this place.

12:12.523 --> 12:14.651
My guess is he wasn't a people person.

12:14.734 --> 12:15.568
[panting]

12:18.905 --> 12:19.906
[wind whistling]

12:20.281 --> 12:21.115
[growls]

12:21.532 --> 12:23.242
[wind howls]

12:23.326 --> 12:24.702
Whoa.

12:24.786 --> 12:25.662
Cold wind.

12:25.745 --> 12:27.538
Definitely a sign.

12:27.622 --> 12:28.623
[scanner clicks, whines]

12:30.041 --> 12:31.459
[scanner chiming, beeping]

12:32.502 --> 12:34.837
-Energy levels are rising.
-Listen!

12:35.797 --> 12:38.591
-[scanner clicks]
-[Spence] Something's coming!

12:39.175 --> 12:40.259
Get your camera ready.

12:43.429 --> 12:44.263
[growls]

12:47.058 --> 12:47.892
[yells]

12:54.649 --> 12:55.483
[coughs]

12:57.610 --> 12:58.861
Oh, uh...

12:58.945 --> 13:00.154
Hi, Mom.

13:01.155 --> 13:03.992
-I think we're in trouble.
-Ya think?

13:04.075 --> 13:04.909
[grunts]

13:05.576 --> 13:06.411
[laughs]

13:06.494 --> 13:09.831
Oh, I'm so sorry about this,
but nothing to worry about.

13:09.914 --> 13:13.584
It's just my daughter, Gabriella,
and her friend, Spence.

13:14.293 --> 13:15.962
I'm sure this comes right off.

13:19.048 --> 13:20.967
It does come off, right?

13:21.050 --> 13:24.178
Oh, yeah. It washes right off.
Right, Spence?

13:24.262 --> 13:25.096
Of course!

13:25.179 --> 13:27.682
It's just a blue base
in a non-toxic powder.

13:27.765 --> 13:28.891
It should come right out.

13:30.226 --> 13:31.352
In theory.

13:31.436 --> 13:33.354
It helps us see ghosts.

13:33.438 --> 13:34.939
Ghosts?!

13:35.523 --> 13:39.068
What? No, no! Of course not!
There aren't any ghosts.

13:39.152 --> 13:41.696
[chuckles]
I mean, ghosts don't even exist.

13:41.779 --> 13:45.575
So that's a no on this one?
Okay, I'll call you later,

13:45.658 --> 13:47.952
and set up a time
to show you that cute bungalow.

13:48.036 --> 13:49.871
Oh, you're gonna love it!
[chuckles]

13:50.705 --> 13:51.539
[sighs]

13:52.582 --> 13:53.541
[moans]

13:53.875 --> 13:56.627
Gabriella Estella Sylvia Flores!

13:56.711 --> 13:58.880
Mom, we were on the trail of a ghost!

14:01.007 --> 14:02.925
-We saw it through the window!
-The chandelier shook!

14:03.009 --> 14:04.969
-[Gabi] The door shut!
-The chair was rocking!

14:05.053 --> 14:08.014
-And the room got super cold!
-[Spence] Look at these readings!

14:08.097 --> 14:09.474
[scanner burbling, buzzes]

14:09.557 --> 14:11.350
Oh, man, it's got powder all over it.

14:12.018 --> 14:13.519
I know the feeling.

14:13.603 --> 14:15.938
Sorry we ruined your sale, Mom.

14:16.522 --> 14:18.941
[sighs] You didn't ruin the sale, honey.

14:19.609 --> 14:22.653
They weren't going to buy it anyway.
And I can't blame them.

14:22.737 --> 14:24.947
It'll cost three times as much to fix
than it's worth.

14:25.031 --> 14:26.449
[creaking]

14:26.532 --> 14:27.450

14:36.793 --> 14:37.752
[faint whispering]

14:39.712 --> 14:41.422
-[growling]
-Come on.

14:42.673 --> 14:43.508
[growls]

14:43.591 --> 14:44.592
Let's go home.

14:47.512 --> 14:48.346
[faint creaking]

14:48.846 --> 14:49.680
Huh?

14:53.351 --> 14:55.895
[Mrs. Flores]
Gabriella! Spencer! Let's go!

14:57.146 --> 14:58.356
[faint creaking]

15:05.238 --> 15:06.864
[Marco, Harper laughing]

15:09.283 --> 15:12.745
We're sorry, Mrs. Flores,
but you gotta admit, it's pretty funny.

15:13.329 --> 15:15.957
[sighs]
Just don't put me on the internet.

15:16.040 --> 15:16.916
[Marco, Harper groan]

15:16.999 --> 15:18.668
What's the point, then?

15:18.751 --> 15:22.338
You're lucky Mom won't let us post this,
or it would have gone viral.

15:22.422 --> 15:24.590
But we really saw a ghost this time!

15:24.674 --> 15:26.676
Oh, yeah? Got pictures?

15:26.759 --> 15:28.136
-Well...
-Uh...

15:29.637 --> 15:32.515
Thought so. Pics or it didn't happen.

15:32.598 --> 15:36.352
Because if you two ever did see a ghost
you'd be so scared, you'd be like,

15:36.436 --> 15:38.187
[wailing]

15:38.271 --> 15:40.898
[Harper] "Oh, a ghost!
Oh, I'm so scared!"

15:40.982 --> 15:42.024
[laughing]

15:42.525 --> 15:43.359
Oh--!

15:44.360 --> 15:48.781
Look, when we find a ghost,
not only will we <i>not </i>be scared,

15:48.865 --> 15:53.286
but you two will have to apologize and
admit you've been wrong this whole time!

15:55.371 --> 15:56.205
Yeah!

15:57.540 --> 15:58.374
[Harper grunts]

15:59.375 --> 16:00.209
[Marco grunts]

16:01.961 --> 16:02.795
[whines]

16:03.212 --> 16:04.046
Ugh!

16:05.173 --> 16:06.007
Hmm.

16:06.716 --> 16:08.968
Sounds like a challenge to me.

16:09.051 --> 16:12.096
What do you say we find out
how brave they <i>really </i>are?

16:12.180 --> 16:13.890
Sure! [chuckles]

16:14.557 --> 16:15.391
How?

16:15.475 --> 16:17.602
-We'll help them find a ghost.
-[buzzes]

16:17.685 --> 16:18.895
[laughing, gasps]

16:18.978 --> 16:19.812

Ugh! Bug! Bug! [whimpering]

16:23.566 --> 16:24.400
[shutter clicks]

16:25.485 --> 16:26.319
Hey!

16:27.320 --> 16:29.363
-[crickets chirping]
-[Gabi] You have to work?

16:29.447 --> 16:32.033
[Mrs. Flores] Can't be helped, sweetie.
I've got an open house.

16:32.116 --> 16:33.409
At night?

16:33.493 --> 16:35.536
It's the only time
these buyers are available.

16:35.620 --> 16:37.788
Plus, I've got to go over contracts
at the office,

16:37.872 --> 16:39.999
and post another listing. [sighs]

16:40.166 --> 16:41.167
Dinner's on the counter.

16:42.126 --> 16:43.044
Rr-rowl...?

16:44.837 --> 16:45.922
I won't be too late.

16:46.005 --> 16:47.173
-Bye-bye!
-See ya!

16:47.256 --> 16:49.759
-You wanna watch a movie?
-Another ghost story?

16:49.842 --> 16:51.010
-Of course!
-[eerie ringtone plays]

16:52.887 --> 16:55.306
-[phone beeps]
-Ghost Patrol! Haunted? We can help!

16:55.389 --> 16:57.183
[caller] <i>Oh, Ghost Patrol!</i>

16:57.266 --> 17:00.311
<i>Thank goodness I found you!</i>
<i>I've just seen a ghost!</i>

17:00.394 --> 17:01.312
[gasps]

17:01.687 --> 17:03.981
-Really? You saw it?
-[beeps]

17:04.065 --> 17:05.983
<i>Oh, yes, absolutely!</i>

17:06.067 --> 17:07.944
[high-pitched voice]
I saw it with my own two eyes.

17:08.027 --> 17:11.948
It was right in front of me.
It gave me such a fright!

17:12.031 --> 17:13.324
Can you describe the aberration?

17:14.617 --> 17:17.870
<i>Well, it was a little red</i>
<i>and sometimes it... itches?</i>

17:17.954 --> 17:18.788
[mumbling]

17:20.581 --> 17:22.875
She means describe the ghost!

17:22.959 --> 17:24.669
Oh. Well, it was...

17:25.503 --> 17:26.837
it's hard to say.

17:26.921 --> 17:27.755
It was...

17:29.048 --> 17:29.882
[Marco] big.

17:30.633 --> 17:31.884
How big?

17:32.635 --> 17:33.469
This big.

17:36.931 --> 17:38.057
[Marco] It was...

17:39.141 --> 17:40.142
-dancing?
-Ahem.

17:41.143 --> 17:42.895
I mean... flying!

17:42.979 --> 17:48.985
Yeah, I saw it fly
into the old Geist Mansion!

17:51.571 --> 17:52.572
[beeps]

17:53.948 --> 17:55.783
-[chuckles]
-[beeps]

17:56.534 --> 17:58.286
[howls] Oo-oo!

18:01.831 --> 18:04.292
Just gonna make a little adjustment.

18:04.875 --> 18:06.335
-Are you sure this is gonna scare them?
-[recording growls]

18:06.419 --> 18:07.420
[yelps]

18:09.255 --> 18:10.172

18:10.256 --> 18:12.592
-I love you, phone.
-[beeping]

18:13.092 --> 18:13.926

18:14.135 --> 18:15.344

18:15.803 --> 18:18.014
-[squirts]
-[Harper] Oh, yeah, this is gonna work.

18:18.598 --> 18:22.810
We're definitely gonna scare
those dweebs, if we stick to the plan.

18:23.144 --> 18:25.062
Uh... plan?

18:25.271 --> 18:27.440
[sighs]
We've been over this!

18:27.523 --> 18:31.110
When they come into the room,
you pull this wire...

18:33.070 --> 18:33.904
[screeching, rattling]

18:35.281 --> 18:39.327
And we jump out wearing those costumes.

18:39.952 --> 18:41.996
And we scare the stuffing out of them!

18:42.580 --> 18:47.293
Then we post the video so everyone can see
what babies the Ghost Patrol are.

18:47.376 --> 18:49.462
It'll go viral for sure.

18:49.545 --> 18:51.922
All right. [chuckles]

18:52.006 --> 18:53.633
[faint roaring]

18:58.179 --> 18:59.180
Eh.

19:00.097 --> 19:02.141
[roaring, hissing]

19:08.439 --> 19:09.273
[scanner clicks, whines]

19:09.357 --> 19:11.859
-Major fluctuations in atmospheric energy.
-[scanner beeping]

19:11.942 --> 19:14.654
Electromagnetic frequencies
are off the charts!

19:14.737 --> 19:16.447
[Gabi] Looks like our ghost is back!

19:18.949 --> 19:20.034
Right on time.

19:20.117 --> 19:24.372
Ha! Spence actually thinks that piece
of junk is gonna tell him something.

19:25.498 --> 19:26.916
Plan in motion.

19:29.293 --> 19:30.628
Where's my flashlight?

19:31.671 --> 19:32.505
Mm.

19:34.173 --> 19:35.675
[handles click, doors creak]

19:38.427 --> 19:39.261
What's wrong?

19:39.345 --> 19:41.138
I just thought of something.

19:41.222 --> 19:44.767
What if it's an evil ghost,
out to exact its revenge?

19:44.850 --> 19:46.268
What are you getting at?

19:46.977 --> 19:50.439
Maybe the reason no one's been able
to prove the existence of ghosts

19:50.523 --> 19:52.525
is that no one's lived to tell the tale.

19:53.401 --> 19:56.278
Maybe you watch too many scary movies.

20:01.742 --> 20:02.576
[chuckling]

20:03.786 --> 20:04.745
[sniffing]

20:04.829 --> 20:06.205
Anybody home?

20:07.665 --> 20:09.583
[squeaking]

20:10.167 --> 20:12.378
-I'd say that's a yes.
-[shutter clicks]

20:13.462 --> 20:15.297
-Hello?
-[squeaking]

20:15.381 --> 20:17.675
-[gasps]
-Are you a friendly ghost?

20:17.800 --> 20:18.801
[squeaking]

20:19.802 --> 20:20.803
[chuckles softly]

20:21.887 --> 20:24.765
-Is that a yes or a no?
-Eh.

20:26.267 --> 20:27.351

Ugh--!

20:33.524 --> 20:34.650
-[recording roars]
-[whistling stops]

20:40.448 --> 20:42.032
It's coming from upstairs.

20:42.700 --> 20:43.534
[howling]

20:47.705 --> 20:48.539
Who's that?

20:49.081 --> 20:51.459
Probably just an... echo.

20:53.502 --> 20:55.129
They're going the wrong way!

20:55.212 --> 20:56.172
[beeps]

20:57.173 --> 20:58.007
[recording roars]

20:58.215 --> 20:59.550
Now it's upstairs again.

21:01.802 --> 21:02.803
[chuckling]

21:05.347 --> 21:06.182
[hissing]

21:12.438 --> 21:17.234
Some kind of ghost vapor.
[gasps] It must have just been here!

21:17.318 --> 21:18.152
[shutter clicks]

21:18.235 --> 21:20.321
A picture of smoke isn't gonna
prove anything.

21:20.404 --> 21:22.823
-We need the ghost
-[growling echoes]

21:24.200 --> 21:25.034
Look!

21:41.425 --> 21:42.259
[Harper laughs]

21:42.343 --> 21:45.638
This is gonna be good.
Spray some more of that fake fog.

21:45.721 --> 21:46.722
[hissing]

21:50.976 --> 21:54.438
[voice echoes] <i>Get out.</i>

21:56.565 --> 21:57.817
What are you doing?

21:57.900 --> 22:01.529
Don't tell them to leave.
We haven't done the big scare yet.

22:01.612 --> 22:02.988
I didn't say anything.

22:03.072 --> 22:06.492
[voice echoes] <i>Get out!</i>

22:08.285 --> 22:09.370
Marco...

22:09.954 --> 22:10.788
Uh...

22:12.289 --> 22:13.249
[moaning]

22:13.791 --> 22:16.460
[voice yells] <i>I said get out!</i>

22:16.544 --> 22:17.545
[screaming]

22:17.628 --> 22:18.462
[faint screaming]

22:19.380 --> 22:21.924
-That's concerning.
-We've got it on the run!

22:22.550 --> 22:23.384
[barks]

22:23.926 --> 22:25.427

22:26.178 --> 22:28.472
[voice wails] <i>Leave this place!</i>

22:28.556 --> 22:30.599
[gasps] We're trying!

22:30.683 --> 22:32.017

22:42.152 --> 22:43.320
[cackling]

22:45.072 --> 22:45.948
Wait a minute.

22:47.700 --> 22:49.201
[cackling]

22:50.619 --> 22:51.620
It's plastic.

22:52.830 --> 22:54.665
And hardly a ghost.

22:54.748 --> 22:56.041
[yelling]

22:56.417 --> 22:57.251
[Marco whimpering]

22:58.127 --> 22:59.128

23:04.008 --> 23:06.969
[whispers]
Hey. I don't think this is the way out.

23:07.052 --> 23:07.886
Shh!

23:08.637 --> 23:10.264
[cackling]

-So they were the ones who called us.
-And we fell for it.

24:30.552 --> 24:33.681
At least this thing

24:33.764 --> 24:36.225
It looks <i>almost </i>authentic.

I'm sure it's just
a film projection or something.

Get 'em off! Get 'em off me!
[wails]

35:07.230 --> 35:09.024
Harper, what's wrong?

35:09.107 --> 35:09.941
[screeches]

35:10.025 --> 35:13.903
It's a nightmare. Only she can see it.

35:14.779 --> 35:18.033
The more fear they create,
the more they multiply.

35:18.116 --> 35:19.117
[wailing]

35:19.200 --> 35:21.578
Harper? Wait for me!

35:29.044 --> 35:30.295
[screeching]

35:36.843 --> 35:38.470
Happy now?

35:41.473 --> 35:45.060
I present to you... Geist Manor!

35:45.143 --> 35:46.936
[clients murmur]

35:52.359 --> 35:53.860
Oh, my.

35:53.943 --> 35:56.237
Oh, sure, it needs a little updating,

35:56.321 --> 35:59.908
but this house been here
for nearly 200 years.

35:59.991 --> 36:02.994
You would be owning a piece of history!

36:03.495 --> 36:04.954
[distant scream echoes]

36:06.331 --> 36:08.833
Oh, I'm sure that's just
the house settling.

36:09.626 --> 36:11.044
[screaming]

36:13.380 --> 36:18.009
Get 'em off! Get 'em off!
Why won't you help me?

36:18.093 --> 36:20.387
What are you talking about?
I don't see anything.

36:21.471 --> 36:22.472
[screeching]

36:23.890 --> 36:25.100
Hey, watch the hair!

36:25.850 --> 36:26.851
Hmm.

36:32.941 --> 36:34.150
My hair's gone!

36:34.234 --> 36:37.904
My beautiful, beautiful hair!
[sobbing]

36:39.114 --> 36:41.574
Oh, this is a disaster!

36:41.658 --> 36:46.246
They won't stop until they scare the life
out of every single person!

36:46.329 --> 36:50.208
Once they're done with this manor,
they'll take over the town!

36:50.291 --> 36:51.626
Then the country!

36:51.710 --> 36:53.378
Then the world!

36:55.922 --> 36:56.923
We can help.

36:59.092 --> 37:00.093
[Spooky whines]

37:00.176 --> 37:02.637
Eh... yeah.

37:03.888 --> 37:05.849
Do you really think

37:05.932 --> 37:08.935
two ragamuffins
and an overgrown squirrel

37:09.018 --> 37:11.771
are any match for these phantasms?

37:11.855 --> 37:14.441
But we can't let those demon brains
take over!

37:14.524 --> 37:16.693
And we've been ghost hunting
a long time.

37:17.110 --> 37:20.321
Mr. Geist, we need to make this right.

37:21.781 --> 37:23.491
Well...

37:23.575 --> 37:27.704
if you're truly bound and determined, I--

37:28.997 --> 37:30.957
[chuckles] Come with me!

37:31.458 --> 37:34.169
And they don't make banisters
like this anymore!

37:34.252 --> 37:35.962
[chuckles, moans]

37:36.045 --> 37:38.715
[Marco yelling] I'm bald!

37:40.133 --> 37:41.134
[panting]

37:41.301 --> 37:43.052
Marco? What are you doing here?

37:43.136 --> 37:44.763
I'm bald! [sobs]

37:44.846 --> 37:49.309
Follically challenged! I'm bald! Bald!

37:49.934 --> 37:51.686
Harper, what's he talking about?

37:52.270 --> 37:55.190
[stammering]
Creepy c-c-crawlies!

37:55.857 --> 37:58.026
They're everywhere!
Everywhere! Everywhere!

37:58.109 --> 38:00.320
I can't take it, I can't take it!
[wails]

38:00.403 --> 38:02.363
[demons screeching]

38:02.447 --> 38:03.281
[all gasp]

38:04.157 --> 38:04.991
[woman] Ghosts!

38:05.074 --> 38:07.160
There are ghosts in this house!

38:07.243 --> 38:08.328
[growling]

38:09.412 --> 38:10.413
Whoa!

[snarling]

38:13.416 --> 38:14.417

38:14.709 --> 38:16.044
What in the...?

38:19.172 --> 38:22.133

38:27.013 --> 38:27.847
Oh, no--!

38:32.769 --> 38:33.728
Rr-rowl!

38:34.187 --> 38:37.190
Now, these extractors,
each in their unique way

38:37.273 --> 38:40.026
can immobilize and capture the phantasms.

38:40.109 --> 38:41.277
Okay. Perfect.

38:41.361 --> 38:44.948
However, they are completely harmless
to the living.

38:45.031 --> 38:45.990
Harmless. Gotcha.

38:46.074 --> 38:47.617
-Ready?
-No.

38:47.700 --> 38:48.743
Good.

[yelps]

38:53.331 --> 38:54.332
Whoo-hoo!

Whoa!

39:11.224 --> 39:12.225
Ugh!

39:12.976 --> 39:16.604
At least yours does something!

Good grief.

Whoa!

40:06.821 --> 40:07.655
[chuckles]

40:09.115 --> 40:10.116
All right!

40:11.034 --> 40:14.245
That was good!
But let's not get ahead of ourselves.

If no one buys this house,
I'll lose my job!

40:29.636 --> 40:31.971
Our whole family will be run out of town!

40:32.055 --> 40:34.974
[gasps]
We'll have to eat <i>worms </i>to survive!

40:35.058 --> 40:39.395
[sobbing]
Oh, what kind of mother would I be?

40:40.647 --> 40:43.024
-Mom! That doesn't even make sense!
-[gasping]

40:43.107 --> 40:46.319
Please! Don't let my family eat worms!

[sobbing]

40:49.405 --> 40:50.865
[moans] Ew! Ew!

40:53.076 --> 40:54.786
There's gotta be a way to help them.

40:54.869 --> 40:57.664
Colonel Geist said our weapons
don't have any affect the living.

40:58.873 --> 40:59.874
Oof!

41:01.000 --> 41:02.585
Uh... try yours.

Huh...?

41:14.097 --> 41:19.477
-I just had the worst dream ever.
-No, I did.

41:21.020 --> 41:23.272

I missed you so much.

41:34.742 --> 41:35.910

41:36.244 --> 41:38.496
We take back everything
we ever said about the Ghost Patrol!

41:38.579 --> 41:40.748
-Ghosts are real!
-Absolutely, completely real!

41:40.832 --> 41:42.709
-You guys are the coolest!
-Ghost Patrol rocks!

41:42.792 --> 41:45.503
-We'll never make fun of you again!
-Anything you want us to do,

41:45.586 --> 41:47.338
-just name it!
-Anything! Anything at all!

41:47.422 --> 41:48.923
A little help would be nice.

41:49.007 --> 41:51.843
We'll handle the phantasms,
and you show people the door.

41:51.926 --> 41:54.387
-You got it, little brother.
-We're on it.

41:55.430 --> 41:57.849
And don't let the phantasms get you again!

41:57.932 --> 41:59.726
No prob!

42:01.060 --> 42:02.061
[thumps]

42:04.564 --> 42:08.776
No! I can't swim!
The water will ruin my suit!

42:10.653 --> 42:14.282
This is not the house you're looking for.

42:14.782 --> 42:17.118
You should just leave.

42:17.994 --> 42:18.953
[slams]

42:19.912 --> 42:23.666
I don't think this is the house
I'm looking for. I should just leave.

Help! Help! Oh, help!

42:31.466 --> 42:34.218
Mrs. Choi! You're okay!
You're not possessed!

42:34.302 --> 42:37.305
I know. I was feeling left out.

42:38.306 --> 42:41.851
And the square footage gives you
plenty of room for a growing family.

42:42.351 --> 42:44.228
[man whimpering]

42:45.980 --> 42:48.483
Oh, no more lip gloss! No!

[Harper] Hey!

42:58.868 --> 43:00.286
Goodbye!

43:00.369 --> 43:01.954
-No, thank you.
-Goodbye!

43:02.038 --> 43:03.748
I don't think so!
[yelping]

43:04.499 --> 43:07.668
So, wanna go to the mall
and never speak of this again?

43:36.072 --> 43:37.240
I think?

43:37.323 --> 43:41.119

Won't anybody buy this house?!

[sighing]

43:51.712 --> 43:52.547
[gasps]

43:52.630 --> 43:54.006
Is that a ghost?

43:55.216 --> 43:57.802
Mom, this is Colonel Geist.

43:58.386 --> 43:59.846
Colonel, this is my mom.

44:00.847 --> 44:04.267
I thought all this ghost stuff
was in your imagination.

44:04.350 --> 44:09.355
I assure you, madam, I'm quite a reality.

44:09.438 --> 44:11.566
So that's it? We got them all?

44:11.816 --> 44:12.817
[sniffing]

44:12.900 --> 44:13.776
[barks]

44:15.153 --> 44:16.154
Whew.

44:18.906 --> 44:19.740
[phone beeps]

44:19.824 --> 44:21.909
Eh? What are you doing?

44:21.993 --> 44:25.079
-Hitting "delete."
-We're "taking out the film."

44:25.163 --> 44:27.498
But-- but why?

44:27.582 --> 44:30.585
Because it's the right thing to do.

44:30.668 --> 44:32.503
Plus, we love a good conspiracy.

44:34.172 --> 44:36.299
[laughing] Thank you.

44:36.382 --> 44:39.343
You did admirable work today.

44:39.427 --> 44:43.097
Might you consider
a permanent partnership?

44:43.181 --> 44:46.726
-Teaming up with a ghost?
-Oh, we are <i>so </i>in!

44:47.018 --> 44:48.019
[barks]

44:48.561 --> 44:49.770
[chuckles]

44:49.854 --> 44:52.648
Well, our first order of business

44:52.732 --> 44:56.152
is what to do
with that "For Sale" sign outside.

44:56.235 --> 44:59.572
[gasps]
Why don't <i>you </i>buy the house?

44:59.655 --> 45:03.618
Yeah! With all those antiques and jewels
you've got upstairs,

45:03.701 --> 45:04.994
you've gotta be loaded.

45:05.077 --> 45:08.956
I would, if it weren't the fact that...

45:09.790 --> 45:11.375
I'm not alive.

45:11.876 --> 45:14.003
Actually, Colonel,
I can help you with that.

45:14.086 --> 45:16.881
I can set up a partnership
in the name of the Ghost Patrol.

45:16.964 --> 45:18.049
[both] Yes!

45:18.132 --> 45:19.091
[Gabi squeals]

45:19.175 --> 45:22.511
You, of course,
would be a... invisible partner.

45:22.595 --> 45:26.057
Well, I'm intrigued, madam!

45:26.140 --> 45:29.477
I see this as the perfect location
for the new headquarters.

45:29.560 --> 45:32.313
We could start fixing it up,
modernize the decor,

45:32.396 --> 45:34.315
and of course estate-wide Wi-Fi...

45:34.398 --> 45:36.609
So, turns out you were right all along.

45:37.944 --> 45:39.028
About what?

45:39.111 --> 45:40.696
The conspiracy.

45:42.156 --> 45:43.532
What conspiracy?

45:44.784 --> 45:46.285
[panting]

45:48.329 --> 45:49.664
Right.

45:54.460 --> 45:55.461
[laughing]

45:57.213 --> 45:58.047
[both] <i>Yeah!</i>
