WEBVTT

00:00.920 --> 00:03.820
Ingrid.. I miss you.
-You look like a slut.

00:06.020 --> 00:10.660
How are Ingrid and Sara doing?
-Why are you interrogating me like this?

00:10.660 --> 00:12.780
Stop walking around like a fucking cliche.

00:15.480 --> 00:17.900
I trust you 100%.

00:22.960 --> 00:26.800
Chris hooked up with someone at the
Halloween party, and his girl found out.

00:26.825 --> 00:28.104
She went psycho!

00:46.880 --> 00:49.380
<i>[ANSWER!]</i>

00:52.460 --> 00:53.940
Have you talked to him?

00:54.500 --> 00:55.760
Yes.

00:56.660 --> 00:57.940
What did he say?

01:00.260 --> 01:01.580
Isak!

01:02.580 --> 01:03.820
Let's sit down.

01:12.520 --> 01:15.300
He's not very happy.

01:20.060 --> 01:23.060
He has to talk to me.
He has to let me explain.

01:24.580 --> 01:28.880
Maybe he just needs some little space.

01:33.120 --> 01:34.540
How did he find out about it?

01:35.980 --> 01:37.960
The entire school is talking about it.

01:38.060 --> 01:40.500
Yeah, but how did he find out?

01:41.480 --> 01:42.980
Elias...

01:45.200 --> 01:47.686
So then he just believed it?

01:47.711 --> 01:48.864
It's true.

01:55.020 --> 01:58.280
I don't understand how he can believe
a rumor without talking to me first?

02:01.860 --> 02:04.180
He said he should've
known about it already.

02:07.060 --> 02:10.400
You've been acting
a little random lately.

02:11.720 --> 02:13.720
Maybe it just made sense.

02:16.880 --> 02:21.040
<i>[Don't think we should talk now.]</i>

02:18.020 --> 02:19.380
Is it Jonas?

02:24.840 --> 02:27.400
<i>[You have to let me explain!!!]</i>

02:33.160 --> 02:36.318
<i>[If I see you now I'm going to say things
I'll regret, so I'd rather call you</i>

02:36.543 --> 02:39.582
<i>when I'm ready to hear your
explanation why you chose</i>

02:39.607 --> 02:42.928
<i>to fuck up everything that
was good between us.]</i>

02:48.300 --> 02:49.400
It'll be okay.

03:02.820 --> 03:03.880
It'll be okay.

04:12.660 --> 04:14.260
How are you doing?

04:14.760 --> 04:15.800
I'm fine.

04:15.940 --> 04:20.140
I think if I were in your situation,
I would have been really upset.

04:21.280 --> 04:23.014
I've been overhearing
some conversations and

04:23.039 --> 04:25.704
Ulla from 2STE said it was Chris'
girlfriend who told everyone.

04:28.760 --> 04:30.860
Has Chris said something himself?

04:31.240 --> 04:35.180
There's a lot of people
who are saying you're slutty.

04:35.260 --> 04:36.540
Vilde!

04:36.980 --> 04:38.540
I'm just telling the truth.

04:40.320 --> 04:43.720
There's a rumor going around
that girls have black listed you.

04:44.600 --> 04:45.620
What does that mean?

04:45.700 --> 04:49.399
I'm not really sure. But Tiril from
2STB was blacklisted last year.

04:49.424 --> 04:50.740
They cut off her hair.

04:50.740 --> 04:51.660
Hello?!

04:51.660 --> 04:53.380
I'm just telling you what I've heard!

05:06.500 --> 05:07.660
Good job, Eva!

05:07.660 --> 05:09.660
Excuse me?!

05:09.660 --> 05:10.820
Excuse you for what?

05:14.340 --> 05:17.760
You seem like really charming girls.

05:18.440 --> 05:22.400
Oh, so sweet!
Defending your friend.

05:23.000 --> 05:26.340
It seems like you're very close.

05:26.340 --> 05:30.560
I'm sure you'd like to continue that.
Until she pisses on your entire life.

05:30.960 --> 05:33.100
Then I won't think you're
so damn charming anymore.

05:40.040 --> 05:41.640
What did she mean by that?

05:44.500 --> 05:46.280
Were you and Ingrid friends?

05:47.540 --> 05:48.820
A long time ago.

05:49.240 --> 05:52.580
What did she mean by
"pissing on your entire life"?

05:52.580 --> 05:54.680
I don't know.
-There must have been something?

05:54.680 --> 05:56.680
I'm sure she said it
to create drama, okay?

05:57.420 --> 05:58.420
Okay.

06:26.900 --> 06:30.280
<i>[But how long do you think it will
be until he wants to talk to me?]</i>

06:42.720 --> 06:47.560
<i>[I don't know, Eva.]</i>

07:01.560 --> 07:05.720
<i>[But it seems like he's still
just as mad at me. What did he say?]</i>

07:07.160 --> 07:13.900
<i>[He hasn't talked about you.]</i>

07:19.240 --> 07:20.467
What are you doing here?

07:20.492 --> 07:21.864
What do you think?

07:23.680 --> 07:27.740
I got a call from school
because you were in a fight!

07:28.540 --> 07:29.652
That's why I came home.

07:29.677 --> 07:31.200
You could've spared the trip.

07:31.200 --> 07:32.595
No. I couldn't.

07:32.620 --> 07:34.591
Because I come home and
you haven't received

07:34.616 --> 07:36.780
a passing grade in math
for your Christmas grade.

07:36.780 --> 07:38.960
Christmas grades don't count.

07:39.400 --> 07:40.600
What happened?

07:40.625 --> 07:44.200
Nothing happened. Some girls attacked me.

07:44.200 --> 07:45.985
Just like that? Unprovoked?

07:46.010 --> 07:47.504
Yes.

07:47.720 --> 07:49.366
Who were those girls?

07:49.391 --> 07:51.944
No one! Some bitches
from the second grade.

07:52.000 --> 07:53.480
Eva!
-Mom!

07:53.600 --> 07:55.094
I can't handle
this conversation.

07:55.119 --> 07:56.720
-You have to! We
have to talk about-

07:56.720 --> 07:58.900
No! I actually don't have to.

07:58.900 --> 08:02.340
You can't be gone all year, and then
suddenly start meddling in my life.

08:02.365 --> 08:03.660
It doesn't work like that.

08:03.660 --> 08:05.010
I just want to help!

08:05.035 --> 08:06.924
If you want to help me...

08:07.120 --> 08:09.015
Then stop yelling at me!

08:09.040 --> 08:11.674
The entire school hates me,
and Jonas wants to break up.

08:11.699 --> 08:14.748
So the last thing I want is for
you to come home and bitch at me!

08:15.540 --> 08:16.560
Jonas?

08:17.420 --> 08:20.660
Are you dating Jonas?
Jonas-Jonas?

08:22.080 --> 08:23.120
But Jonas is...

08:23.145 --> 08:25.060
Mom! I know who Jonas is.

08:25.060 --> 08:27.220
You don't need to tell me.

08:33.480 --> 08:35.440
Don't you think Vilde is really...

08:37.700 --> 08:39.193
... far removed from Earth?

08:39.218 --> 08:42.424
She's floating on a pink cloud
with all this Russ stuff.

08:42.720 --> 08:47.300
Russ time is her life,
and there are three more years.

08:47.320 --> 08:50.840
I just don't understand
what the big deal is.

08:50.980 --> 08:54.820
But, it's kind of nice though.

09:01.140 --> 09:02.760
He still hasn't called?

09:09.260 --> 09:13.920
You know you don't have
to wait until he is ready to talk, right?

09:15.100 --> 09:16.980
You have the right to explain yourself.

09:23.900 --> 09:26.560
You know what always
gets me in a better mood?

09:28.940 --> 09:31.180
Okay, promise you won't
hold it against me?

09:32.200 --> 09:33.240
Yeah.

09:33.260 --> 09:36.940
Seriously, you can't tell anyone.

09:38.720 --> 09:40.300
It's between us.

09:45.660 --> 09:50.120
If this song doesn't put you
in a better mood, then..

10:27.560 --> 10:30.620
Justin Bieber? Cool...

10:34.020 --> 10:37.480
It's not something I
listen to, but eh...

10:37.920 --> 10:40.570
It was because eh...

10:40.595 --> 10:42.184
Whatever.

10:43.240 --> 10:45.500
I don't need to explain
myself to you, anyway.

10:52.140 --> 10:55.140
Is there something? Something you want?

10:55.620 --> 10:57.600
Will you come home
with me to do homework?

11:00.960 --> 11:02.844
Excuse me, Willhelm.

11:02.869 --> 11:03.904
William.

11:06.480 --> 11:09.700
That pretty much answers
the question, don't you think?

11:09.780 --> 11:10.940
What?

11:11.000 --> 11:12.960
I don't even know your name.

11:14.100 --> 11:16.160
Call me what you want.

11:19.840 --> 11:21.374
Yeah but then...

11:21.399 --> 11:24.944
Then I choose to
call you asshole.

11:29.340 --> 11:30.754
You think it was funny?

11:30.779 --> 11:31.884
Are you coming?

11:33.620 --> 11:36.580
I thought I answered
quite clearly, but...

11:37.380 --> 11:38.760
No.

11:45.180 --> 11:47.340
Let me know when you change your mind.

11:48.560 --> 11:50.760
Go home and wait for it.

12:06.940 --> 12:09.080
Who does he think he is?!

12:09.840 --> 12:11.380
Why did you call him Willhelm?

12:12.060 --> 12:13.060
Huh?

12:13.140 --> 12:16.160
You called him Willhelm,
but you know he's called William.

12:16.180 --> 12:18.300
Oh yeah, that was a
suppression technique.

12:19.560 --> 12:20.640
Okay?

12:21.100 --> 12:23.040
I saw it on Suits once.

12:23.260 --> 12:24.960
I've always wanted to use it.

12:25.400 --> 12:26.540
Wow.

12:26.740 --> 12:27.860
Impressed?

12:28.020 --> 12:29.580
Mostly surprised.

12:30.140 --> 12:33.700
That you both watch Suits,
and listen to Justin Bieber.

12:35.420 --> 12:37.600
Was that a little joke?

12:37.940 --> 12:39.700
You made a joke Eva!

12:39.800 --> 12:42.560
That's a good sign!
That's good.

12:42.560 --> 12:43.600
That's what we like.

12:46.540 --> 12:49.585
<i>[I'm calling in an extraordinary
Russ bus meeting tomorrow at 15.00h.</i>

12:49.610 --> 12:51.020
<i>Important that everyone comes.]</i>

12:51.020 --> 12:53.020
Extraordinary bus meeting?

12:54.000 --> 12:57.258
It's funny that she's
calling it extraordinary,

12:57.283 --> 13:00.404
since we have so many
ordinary bus meetings.

13:05.300 --> 13:07.560
Is the toilet paper in the box?

13:09.680 --> 13:12.280
And the money?
Has Vilde received the money?

13:18.900 --> 13:24.520
Will this meeting take
a long time? I have something else.

13:24.520 --> 13:30.580
As everyone knows, Eva had an unlucky
incident at the Halloween party.

13:30.580 --> 13:33.490
Quite a lot of people
are upset with her.

13:33.515 --> 13:35.500
Busses have blacklisted her.

13:35.500 --> 13:36.280
Vilde...

13:36.280 --> 13:40.260
I got an upleasant phone
call from the girls yesterday.

13:41.140 --> 13:45.780
They're saying that as long as
Eva is on our bus, we are all blacklisted.

13:46.260 --> 13:47.200
Huh?!

13:47.200 --> 13:50.407
You can laugh, but it's
actually really serious.

13:50.432 --> 13:54.146
Last year someone broke the
brakes on a blacklisted bus.

13:54.171 --> 13:55.840
Everyone could have died.

13:55.840 --> 13:57.700
We don't even have a bus.

13:57.960 --> 14:01.320
No, but they can do other things.
Cutting our hair, or..

14:02.000 --> 14:05.760
Throw us in the water. I know
of several girls that went too far.

14:05.780 --> 14:06.980
They can try.

14:07.800 --> 14:09.602
We have to talk about this.

14:09.627 --> 14:14.564
It's unfair that we'll all become
unpopular because of Eva being slutty.

14:14.980 --> 14:17.164
It's interesting that you,
someone who describes

14:17.189 --> 14:20.464
herself as a feminist, is
calling others slutty.

14:23.680 --> 14:27.018
That's not true. I think
Penetrator Chris is also slutty.

14:27.043 --> 14:29.863
It's unfair that he doesn't
get this reputation.

14:29.888 --> 14:31.728
He was at much at fault as you.

14:31.840 --> 14:34.560
But that's not my fault either.

14:34.880 --> 14:37.317
Chris doesn't have that
reputation because

14:37.342 --> 14:40.004
guys don't go around
calling each other sluts.

14:40.420 --> 14:42.276
So if you think it's unfair,

14:42.301 --> 14:44.884
you have to stop
calling girls sluts.

14:45.360 --> 14:48.300
Don't yell at me!
I'm not even done talking.

14:48.660 --> 14:53.220
That's not the only reason Chris
said Eva is slutty. There's more.

14:54.920 --> 14:57.560
This isn't the first time
Eva has ruined a relationship.

14:58.520 --> 14:59.700
Vilde..

15:00.460 --> 15:02.120
That's between me and Ingrid.

15:02.680 --> 15:04.800
It's actually not that simple, Eva.

15:04.980 --> 15:07.740
Because Ingrid has told
Iben and other girls.

15:07.765 --> 15:10.224
What you did affects
all of us as girls.

15:10.900 --> 15:12.520
What is it we are talking about?

15:12.820 --> 15:15.940
Eva used to be best
friends with Ingrid from Pepsi Max.

15:17.020 --> 15:19.960
In the 9th grade,
Ingrid got a boyfriend.

15:20.820 --> 15:25.280
She was really in love with him, and they were
the sweetest couple in the entire school.

15:25.660 --> 15:28.075
Everyone thought they were
perfect for each other.

15:28.100 --> 15:30.324
Their parents thought
they should get married.

15:31.760 --> 15:34.380
But right before summer,
in the 10th grade...

15:35.480 --> 15:37.013
... he started to
behave strangely.

15:37.038 --> 15:39.124
He was dismissive and
didn't reply to her texts.

15:39.820 --> 15:42.000
Ingrid was really sad.

15:42.640 --> 15:48.140
Eva was there for her, comforted
here, and pretended nothing was wrong.

15:48.520 --> 15:51.620
Even though she knew why
he was acting so strange.

15:52.240 --> 15:55.540
Because Eva was seeing
him behind Ingrid's back.

15:56.600 --> 15:58.360
His name was Jonas.

16:01.440 --> 16:04.460
Jonas and Ingrid used to be a couple.

16:07.200 --> 16:11.980
So Eva only has herself to blame
for the situation she is in now.

16:13.460 --> 16:16.680
Because it's pretty messed
up to steal your best friend's boyfriend.

16:17.260 --> 16:19.220
You can't steal anyone.

16:19.220 --> 16:21.380
Whould you want a friend who
hooks up with your boyfriend?

16:21.380 --> 16:26.900
Better than a friend who
calls girls sluts based on rumors.

16:26.940 --> 16:29.660
It's not a rumor, it's true.
Just ask Eva.

16:29.660 --> 16:33.400
I don't understand why
you're attacking Eva.

16:33.520 --> 16:36.520
They can try. We'll get them back.

16:36.680 --> 16:39.995
That might be the way it works
in your Muslim gangster world

16:40.020 --> 16:42.084
but for us it doesn't
work like that.

16:43.060 --> 16:45.440
I can't be bothered listening to this.

16:45.660 --> 16:49.300
You're completely psycho.
You threw water in Ingrid's face.

16:49.480 --> 16:50.780
You're crazy!

16:58.440 --> 17:01.189
I threw water in Ingrid's
face because she and

17:01.214 --> 17:04.664
her friends called you a slut
for hooking up with William.

17:05.120 --> 17:07.915
That's how it works in my
Muslim gangster world.

17:07.940 --> 17:12.104
You don't judge your friends, and you
stand up for them no matter what.

17:18.660 --> 17:22.240
For once it would have been really nice
if you could have defended me, Chris!

19:25.460 --> 19:27.820
Okay, Eva. I'm listening.

19:31.960 --> 19:37.020
I just want you to know I didn't hook
up with Chris because I liked him.

19:38.680 --> 19:40.820
I have never liked him.

19:42.920 --> 19:46.160
I just did it because I
thought you and Ingrid hooked up.

19:50.320 --> 19:51.920
That's your explanation?

19:59.180 --> 20:00.640
Ironic.

20:02.920 --> 20:06.360
I've taken a lot of crap from you
because you thought I was with Ingrid.

20:09.760 --> 20:13.160
But then it's actually you
who was unfaithful. And you lied about it.

20:13.860 --> 20:15.860
And I have to find out through Elias?!

20:17.980 --> 20:23.480
It was you who lied to me first. You said
you weren't with Ingrid, but you were.

20:25.640 --> 20:28.009
I hooked up with Chris
because I was hurt.

20:28.034 --> 20:31.284
It never would've happened if
you hadn't lied to me first.

20:31.740 --> 20:33.780
Okay... So it's my fault?

20:33.780 --> 20:37.260
No! That's not what I meant.

20:40.480 --> 20:43.420
I'm just trying to explain why I did it.

20:45.120 --> 20:46.980
I fucked up, okay?

20:48.280 --> 20:49.440
I'm sorry.

20:50.980 --> 20:53.540
I wish I'd never done it. Really.

20:55.440 --> 20:56.640
I'm sorry.

21:06.100 --> 21:07.100
Jonas...

21:11.140 --> 21:12.800
I love you.

21:20.520 --> 21:26.060
You're saying you hooked up with Christoffer
just because you thought I was with Ingrid.

21:26.260 --> 21:30.000
Why did you have to
cheat just because you thought I was?

21:33.660 --> 21:34.680
I'm sorry.

21:42.100 --> 21:45.560
Eva, it's actually not
about infidelity or lies.

21:46.000 --> 21:48.640
It's about me not
understanding who you are.

21:52.340 --> 21:56.300
When we were in middle school, and you,
Sara, and Ingrid were best friends...

21:57.580 --> 22:02.380
... and I was with Ingrid,
you wanted to be with me.

22:03.140 --> 22:06.659
But now that you have new
friends and they are into third

22:06.684 --> 22:10.324
grade guys, you suddenly want
to be with them all the time.

22:13.440 --> 22:14.900
That's what I don't understand.

22:15.840 --> 22:19.260
You just follow what
everyone else thinks is exciting.

22:21.120 --> 22:23.120
You don't have an own opinion.

22:27.300 --> 22:29.120
What do you really like?

22:29.760 --> 22:31.240
Who are you?

22:47.520 --> 22:49.420
Call me when you've found that out.
