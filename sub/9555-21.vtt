Okay, everybody,

02:17.137 --> 02:18.662
thank you very much for coming
down tonight.

02:18.805 --> 02:20.500
It was wonderful,
wonderful, wonderful.

02:20.641 --> 02:22.234
Now everybody out.

02:22.376 --> 02:24.367
(groaning, shouting)

02:24.511 --> 02:25.501
Al, what's the big rush?

02:25.646 --> 02:27.114
Well, I got a date tonight.

02:27.247 --> 02:30.080
Oh, hey, everybody,
Al's got a date!

02:30.217 --> 02:32.185
-(cheering)
- Let's go, everybody.

02:32.319 --> 02:33.286
Use both exits.

02:33.420 --> 02:35.411
Everybody out.

02:38.925 --> 02:40.791
Oh, Inspiration Point?

02:40.927 --> 02:43.021
You got it.

02:43.163 --> 02:44.255

<i>'Haw. Path?

02:45.632 --> 02:47.157
Can I borrow your car?

02:47.300 --> 02:49.200
I've given it a lot of thought,
and no.

02:49.336 --> 02:52.362
Well, we walk again.

02:52.506 --> 02:54.838
Chachi, two girls?

02:54.975 --> 02:56.067
Yeah, two to one.

02:56.209 --> 02:57.768
I love the odds.

03:01.181 --> 03:02.649
Well, see you tomorrow, guys.

03:02.783 --> 03:03.909
Yeah, right, Leather.

03:04.051 --> 03:05.177
'Hey. Rich?
.l.luh?

03:05.318 --> 03:07.082
Do me a favor and lock up
for me, will you please?

03:07.220 --> 03:08.517
- Sure, Al.
- You know Evelyn, my date?

03:08.655 --> 03:09.781
- Yeah?
- She's a schoolteacher,

03:09.923 --> 03:11.687
and she wouldn't like it
if I was tardy.

03:11.825 --> 03:13.520
(laughs)
Tardy. Oh, Al?

03:13.660 --> 03:14.650
- Al...
- Yep?

03:14.795 --> 03:15.990
Ought to bring her an apple.

03:16.129 --> 03:18.325
- I got it in the car.
- Oh, great.

03:18.465 --> 03:19.694
Have a good time.

03:19.833 --> 03:21.460
Joanie, lock up for me, okay?

03:21.601 --> 03:24.070
Uh, no thanks, big brother.

03:24.204 --> 03:25.933
Smitty's going to show me
the Big Dipper

03:26.073 --> 03:27.336
through his telescope.

03:27.474 --> 03:29.602
Tell the folks I'll be home
a little later.

03:29.743 --> 03:30.972
- See you.
- Bye.

03:31.111 --> 03:33.170
Joanie, Mom and Dad
are never going to buy

03:33.313 --> 03:35.077
that Big Dipper bit.

03:35.215 --> 03:38.515
They bought it when we used it,
Sizzle Lips.

03:38.652 --> 03:39.949
That's true.

03:40.087 --> 03:41.885
Of course,
I carried a telescope.

03:42.022 --> 03:42.989
Let's go.

03:43.123 --> 03:45.182
Ralph, sure you don't want

03:45.325 --> 03:46.656
to join us
for some Chinese food?

03:46.793 --> 03:48.420
Oh, no thanks,
I got a hot date tonight.

03:48.562 --> 03:50.223
She doesn't like Chinese food.

03:50.363 --> 03:52.559
When she was a baby she was
frightened by an egg foo yung.

03:52.699 --> 03:53.825
(laughter)

03:53.967 --> 03:55.662
Do you know how to make
an egg foo yung?

03:55.802 --> 03:57.793
- How?
- Take a young egg and foo it.

03:57.938 --> 03:59.133
(laughter)

03:59.272 --> 04:00.740
No date, huh?

04:00.874 --> 04:02.103
No.

04:02.242 --> 04:03.641
Well, then you lock up.

04:03.777 --> 04:04.972
- Take it easy.
- Right. -See you.

04:05.112 --> 04:06.671
- Potsie?
- Yeah?

04:06.813 --> 04:08.804
Are you ready
for a little moo goo gai pan?

04:08.949 --> 04:10.576
(chuckles)
You bet,

04:10.717 --> 04:12.651
but let's eat first.

04:18.591 --> 04:21.185
Well, here we are again,

04:21.327 --> 04:23.160
all alone,

04:23.296 --> 04:25.230
just the two of us.

04:28.101 --> 04:29.159
Oh!

04:29.302 --> 04:31.202
You're kind
of jumpy tonight, Malph.

04:31.338 --> 04:32.828
Fonz, what are you doing here?

04:32.973 --> 04:34.407
Everybody's got to be someplace.

04:34.541 --> 04:35.508
(chuckles)
Good one!

04:35.642 --> 04:37.007
Yeah, I know, I know.

04:37.144 --> 04:38.236
Where is everybody?

04:38.378 --> 04:40.005
Oh, um, Al had a date,

04:40.147 --> 04:42.548
and everyone else went
to a Chinese restaurant.

04:42.682 --> 04:44.013
I would have gone too, Fonz,

04:44.151 --> 04:46.210
but my date doesn't
like Chinese food.

04:46.353 --> 04:47.479
When she was a baby...

04:47.621 --> 04:48.952
No date, huh, Malph?

04:49.089 --> 04:51.114
No, Fonz.

04:51.258 --> 04:53.488
Okay, what's the matter,
Ralphie?

04:53.627 --> 04:54.788
Nothing's the matter, Fonz.

04:54.928 --> 04:56.418
(snaps)
Spill it.

04:57.764 --> 04:59.323
All right, Fonz.

04:59.466 --> 05:01.628
It's-it's about the girls
I've been dating.

05:01.768 --> 05:05.432
You see, they-they only go out
with me for one thing.

05:05.572 --> 05:07.404
I know the feeling.

05:07.541 --> 05:09.270
It's not that, Fonz.

05:09.409 --> 05:12.379
I wish it was that.

05:12.512 --> 05:14.981
Girls only go out with me
for laughs.

05:15.115 --> 05:17.982
There's another side
to me, Fonz, you know?

05:18.118 --> 05:21.713
And I'm just tired of being
the funniest guy in town.

05:21.855 --> 05:22.947
And the expense...

05:23.089 --> 05:24.250
Do you know what it costs
these days

05:24.391 --> 05:25.654
for a good dribble glass?

05:26.893 --> 05:28.258
I don't know, I'd just,

05:28.395 --> 05:31.888
just kind of like it if
someone would take me seriously.

05:32.032 --> 05:34.558
Hey, listen,
I totally understand, you know?

05:34.701 --> 05:36.601
Now if that's what you want,

05:36.736 --> 05:38.067
you've got to get rid of these.

05:38.205 --> 05:40.105
You've got to throw them away.

05:42.108 --> 05:44.736
Oh, Fonz!

05:44.878 --> 05:46.243
I've got to...

05:46.379 --> 05:48.108
I've got to taper off, you know.

05:48.248 --> 05:49.682
I can't just quit cold turkey.

05:49.816 --> 05:51.580
Cold turkey.

05:51.718 --> 05:53.482
- Yeah?
- That's right.

06:05.632 --> 06:08.124
Oh, hi, Ralph.

06:08.268 --> 06:10.100
Oh, hey, Leather.

06:10.237 --> 06:11.227
How's it going'?

06:11.371 --> 06:12.429
All right.

06:12.572 --> 06:13.767
You all by your lonesome?

06:13.907 --> 06:15.306
(chuckles)
Yeah.

06:15.442 --> 06:16.773
All by my lonesome.

06:16.910 --> 06:18.378
Speaking of lonesome,

06:18.511 --> 06:20.605
I heard about a guy
who's so lone...

06:20.747 --> 06:22.977
No jokes, Ralph, no jokes.

06:23.884 --> 06:25.318
Yeah, I'm all alone tonight,
Leather.

06:25.452 --> 06:28.717
Yep, all alone, all alone,
alone, alone, alone.

06:28.855 --> 06:30.755
How about you?

06:30.891 --> 06:31.881
No date tonight?

06:32.025 --> 06:33.117
Nah.

06:33.260 --> 06:34.386
By the time I finish singing,

06:34.527 --> 06:35.585
everybody's already paired off,

06:35.729 --> 06:39.393
and I get stuck with my,
uh, partner here.

06:39.532 --> 06:41.864
Yeah, I just ditched my partner.

06:42.869 --> 06:44.894
You know, Ralph,

06:45.038 --> 06:46.938
something's been
bugging me lately.

06:47.073 --> 06:49.371
Well, for some reason,

06:49.509 --> 06:52.103
guys seem to shy away from me.

06:52.245 --> 06:54.236
Maybe I scare them.

06:54.381 --> 06:55.746
Oh. yeah?

06:55.882 --> 06:58.613
I guess I might be scared of you
if I didn't know you.

06:58.752 --> 07:00.083
I mean, you're on your own,

07:00.220 --> 07:01.449
you're more mature,

07:01.588 --> 07:02.817
you wear a lot of leather.

07:05.358 --> 07:06.587
Yeah, I guess that's true,

07:06.726 --> 07:10.253
(chuckles) but it sure makes
for lonely evenings.

07:10.397 --> 07:12.388
Yeah.

07:13.400 --> 07:14.834
Hey, look at this,

07:14.968 --> 07:16.936
we're having
a serious discussion here.

07:17.070 --> 07:18.003
Oh, I'm sorry.

07:18.138 --> 07:20.300
No, no, I like that.

07:20.440 --> 07:22.101
Say, Leather, uh,

07:22.242 --> 07:25.940
you know next week is, uh,
having the Military Ball

07:26.079 --> 07:27.706
at the college, you know,

07:27.847 --> 07:29.906
and I was thinking
maybe you'd... (chuckles)

07:30.050 --> 07:32.781
Would you like to, um,
be my date?

07:34.354 --> 07:37.324
Well, it's going to be really,
really great, Leather.

07:37.457 --> 07:40.119
I mean, it's this
big special formal dance.

07:40.260 --> 07:41.853
They have it every year.

07:41.995 --> 07:43.224
It sounds like fun.

07:43.363 --> 07:44.558
I'd love to go.

07:44.698 --> 07:46.427
Great! Then it's a date.

07:46.566 --> 07:48.432
It's a date!

07:48.568 --> 07:50.559
All right.

07:55.675 --> 08:03.139
W-E-E-N-I-E.

08:03.283 --> 08:05.274
Weenie!

08:06.720 --> 08:08.916
That's nine points, Marion,

08:09.055 --> 08:11.046
and I hope I don't see
any more E's.

08:11.191 --> 08:13.990
Oh, that's very good, Howard.

08:14.127 --> 08:15.117
Yeah.

08:15.261 --> 08:16.751
Uh, jonquil.

08:16.896 --> 08:18.022
Now let's see, let's see,

08:18.164 --> 08:20.633
now that's double letter score
for the Q,

08:20.767 --> 08:24.965
uh, so that makes 33 times three
for triple letter score...

08:25.105 --> 08:27.733
and 50 for using
all seven letters,

08:27.874 --> 08:29.808
and my L makes lover
out of over,

08:29.943 --> 08:32.105
so that's a 157 points.

08:32.245 --> 08:35.977
That's the second best play
I've had tonight.

08:36.116 --> 08:38.482
This is really fun, Howard.

08:40.754 --> 08:42.347
Game is over, Marion.

08:42.489 --> 08:43.888
I don't want to play anymore.

08:44.024 --> 08:45.822
Oh, look at,

08:45.959 --> 08:48.860
you've got X-I-P-H-0-I-D,
xiphoid.

08:48.995 --> 08:50.520
Oh, you would have had
so many scores.

08:50.663 --> 08:51.630
Really?

08:51.765 --> 08:53.824
- Too bad, game's over.
- Wait!

08:54.834 --> 08:56.563
Well, you go and watch
Jack Parr.

08:56.703 --> 08:58.694
-(doorbell rings)
- I'll get it.

09:00.573 --> 09:01.563
- Oh, hi, Leather.
- Hi.

09:01.708 --> 09:03.005
- Come on in.
- Oh, Leather.

09:03.143 --> 09:04.304
I saw the lights on.

09:04.444 --> 09:06.572
I hope I'm not interrupting
anything.

09:06.713 --> 09:07.942
(chuckles)
Bang, bang.

09:08.081 --> 09:09.242
No, no.

09:09.382 --> 09:11.680
Howard was just going
to turn on Jack Parr.

09:11.818 --> 09:14.913
He loves to watch Parr cry.

09:15.055 --> 09:16.887
Mrs. C., uh,

09:17.023 --> 09:19.082
I-I need to talk to you
about a couple of things.

09:19.225 --> 09:21.785
Oh, good, I love to talk.

09:21.928 --> 09:25.125
Okay, you two talk.

09:25.265 --> 09:28.895
I'll be down after the show.

09:29.035 --> 09:31.561
He can watch Parr cry
on the upstairs set.

09:31.704 --> 09:34.765
Now, what do you want
to talk about?

09:34.908 --> 09:37.878
Well, Mrs. C.,
I want to become a woman.

09:38.011 --> 09:40.105
I've been invited
to this college dance,

09:40.246 --> 09:42.977
and I don't even know what kind
of dress I should wear.

09:43.116 --> 09:44.777
Does it have to be leather?

09:44.918 --> 09:46.249
No.

09:46.386 --> 09:48.445
It's a fancy dance,
a Military Ball,

09:48.588 --> 09:50.249
and I have a date
with Ralph Malph.

09:50.390 --> 09:52.586
Better get something
wash and dry.

09:52.725 --> 09:55.092
I don't even know
if I should go.

09:55.228 --> 09:57.993
I won't know how to act.

09:58.131 --> 09:59.326
What nonsense.

09:59.466 --> 10:00.627
You can do it.

10:00.767 --> 10:02.599
You stay in our guest room
for one week.

10:02.735 --> 10:05.136
I'll teach you;
you'll just be fine.

10:05.271 --> 10:06.966
Now first,

10:07.107 --> 10:09.337
sitting.

10:10.677 --> 10:12.668
<i>II</i>

10:40.707 --> 10:42.698
<i>II</i>

11:09.736 --> 11:11.727
<i>II</i>

11:13.740 --> 11:16.266
<i>HOWARD: Well Marion,
We got to hand it to you.</i>

11:16.409 --> 11:18.241
<i>You really worked hard
this week,</i>

11:18.378 --> 11:20.710
<i>and you did a terrific job
with Leather.</i>

11:20.847 --> 11:23.509
Oh, come on, dear, everybody is
so busy with the dance.

11:23.650 --> 11:25.175
It's just going to be
you and me.

11:25.318 --> 11:26.410
Well, that's perfect.

11:26.553 --> 11:28.453
We'll have a nice,
quiet meal together.

11:28.588 --> 11:30.579
Dig in.

11:32.659 --> 11:35.890
It's all right, sweetheart,
I'll peel back the foil.

11:36.029 --> 11:37.519
Mom, Mom, come quick.

11:37.664 --> 11:38.631
Leather broke her heel.

11:38.765 --> 11:40.290
- Come on, hurry.
- Oh, dear.

11:40.433 --> 11:42.424
I told her to walk on her toes!

11:42.569 --> 11:44.537
Well, I guess I'll have

11:44.671 --> 11:47.106
a nice quiet meal all by myself.

11:48.508 --> 11:51.443
Oh, Howard, you poor dear.

11:51.578 --> 11:53.569
Just for that,

11:53.713 --> 11:55.340
why don't you start off

11:55.481 --> 11:59.475
with a nice piece of cake?

12:00.587 --> 12:03.921
Why thank you, Marion.

12:04.057 --> 12:07.584
Emblems, gold, I, uh,
lost, can't find,

12:07.727 --> 12:10.321
you know, little eagles, claws.

12:10.463 --> 12:11.828
Yeah, I know what eagles
look like, Richard.

12:11.965 --> 12:13.956
I can't... I need them,
uh, regulations.

12:14.968 --> 12:16.766
Maybe they're in the car.

12:16.903 --> 12:18.496
No, no, wait!

12:18.638 --> 12:20.834
Maybe they're in the car.

12:22.375 --> 12:23.399
JOANIE:
Dad,

12:23.543 --> 12:24.408
Dad, quick, hammer.

12:24.544 --> 12:25.534
Kitchen drawer.

12:25.678 --> 12:28.670
Right.

12:28.815 --> 12:30.715
I found one.

12:30.850 --> 12:32.011
Back seat.

12:32.151 --> 12:33.983
Lori Beth. (laughs)

12:34.120 --> 12:35.952
I'll just put this one

12:36.089 --> 12:37.454
where it's supposed to and then

12:37.590 --> 12:39.115
I'll-I'll put my chin
over the other place.

12:39.259 --> 12:40.988
- No one will notice.
- Richard, I found your button!

12:41.127 --> 12:42.117
- Oh, great. Great.
-(doorbell rings)

12:42.262 --> 12:45.061
I got it.

12:45.198 --> 12:46.393
- Good evening, Richard.
- Oh.

12:46.532 --> 12:47.693
For me? (laughs)

12:47.834 --> 12:48.858
Always clowning.

12:49.002 --> 12:50.401
I can't stand around.

12:50.536 --> 12:53.301
Mom found
my other little button.

12:53.439 --> 12:54.929
Is Leather ready?

12:55.074 --> 12:57.065
Uh, uh, most of her.

13:02.548 --> 13:04.949
Good evening, Mr. Cunningham.

13:05.084 --> 13:06.609
At ease, Malph.

13:06.753 --> 13:08.778
Yes, thank you, sir.

13:08.921 --> 13:11.253
Well, got to hurry up.

13:11.391 --> 13:12.449
Pick up Lori Beth.

13:12.592 --> 13:14.253
See you at the dance, Fly Boy.

13:14.394 --> 13:16.658
(chuckles)
Fly Boy.

13:16.796 --> 13:19.197
Hey, aren't you going to
even call me Dog Face?

13:19.332 --> 13:20.322
No.

13:20.466 --> 13:21.763
You're such a card.

13:21.901 --> 13:23.630
Well, see you.

13:26.773 --> 13:28.764
Now enjoy your dinner, dear.

13:32.178 --> 13:34.044
Forgot corsage!

13:34.180 --> 13:35.841
(stammering)

13:35.982 --> 13:38.110
Ah, found corsage.

13:38.251 --> 13:40.720
Pretty.

13:53.533 --> 13:55.900
Da-da-da-da-da-da!

13:56.035 --> 13:59.733
Gentlemen, presenting
Miss Leather Tuscadero!

14:13.319 --> 14:14.411
Leather,

14:14.554 --> 14:16.318
you look beautiful.

14:24.230 --> 14:26.324
(slow music playing)

14:46.219 --> 14:48.551
Will the owner
of a gray aircraft carrier,

14:48.688 --> 14:50.588
license number, V-E-V-J,

14:50.723 --> 14:52.122
please report to the bandstand.

14:52.258 --> 14:54.090
You've been torpedoed.

14:54.227 --> 14:55.285
(groaning laughter)

14:55.428 --> 14:57.055
But seriously, servicemen,

14:57.196 --> 15:00.325
the Society
of R.0.T.C. Scabbard and Blade

15:00.466 --> 15:02.958
is, uh, pleased to announce
for your entertainment

15:03.102 --> 15:06.265
Midshipman Potsie Weber
and Miss Jennifer Jerome.

15:06.406 --> 15:07.703
(applause)

15:14.514 --> 15:15.879
You were great, Rich.

15:16.015 --> 15:18.074
I think I bombed.

Thank you, Midshipman Weber

16:55.314 --> 16:57.806
for that lovely
musical interlude.

17:05.525 --> 17:06.685
POTSIE:
Hey, guys, there's Malph.

17:06.826 --> 17:08.521
Oh, doesn't Leather
look wonderful!

17:08.661 --> 17:10.925
- Yeah, come on.
- Yeah, come on.

17:11.063 --> 17:12.895
- Leather, you look gorgeous!
- You look fantastic!

17:13.031 --> 17:14.363
- Fantastic.
- Oh, beautiful.

17:14.500 --> 17:16.559
Hey, Malph, Malph,
bring the marshmallows?

17:16.702 --> 17:18.636
You see, last year Ralph
stuck marshmallows

17:18.771 --> 17:19.965
on everybody's sword.

17:20.106 --> 17:21.232
- It was good. Remember?
- Oh, yeah.

17:21.374 --> 17:23.775
I tell you, at a formal affair,
this man has got it.

17:23.910 --> 17:24.843
- He really does, I tell you...
- Sure does.

17:24.977 --> 17:26.308
Gentlemen,

17:26.444 --> 17:27.878
I've outgrown
that sort of thing.

17:28.013 --> 17:28.947
Yes.

17:29.081 --> 17:30.571
Look at the orchid Ralph
gave me.

17:30.716 --> 17:31.911
Does it squirt?

17:32.051 --> 17:33.815
Punch, Leather?

17:33.953 --> 17:35.512
Thank you, Ralph.

17:35.655 --> 17:37.646
"Does it squirt?"

17:39.158 --> 17:41.286
Isn't Ralph acting
a little funny?

17:41.427 --> 17:43.486
- Funny is what he isn't acting.
- Yeah.

17:44.497 --> 17:46.488
Punch?

17:48.901 --> 17:50.767
(laughing loudly)

17:50.903 --> 17:52.803
Ralph!
That's a great one, Malph!

17:52.939 --> 17:54.236
A fly in an ice cube.

17:54.373 --> 17:56.307
-(laughter)
- See that?

17:56.442 --> 17:58.604
Ralph would do that.

17:58.744 --> 17:59.836
(cackles)
I wish I'd thought...

17:59.979 --> 18:01.640
That's not funny.

18:02.682 --> 18:04.878
Ralph, you didn't
put that in there?

18:05.017 --> 18:06.883
Of course not.

18:10.456 --> 18:11.548
What time is it?

18:11.691 --> 18:13.318
Oh, I don't know. Why?

18:13.459 --> 18:15.450
Well, we've got to get
out of here by midnight.

18:15.595 --> 18:18.223
Yeah, but we don't have to be
in till 1:00.

18:18.364 --> 18:21.629
Yowza, yowza, yowza.

18:21.767 --> 18:23.599
You bet.

18:23.736 --> 18:25.329
I hear where Cuba
is breaking off

18:25.471 --> 18:27.667
all diplomatic ties
with the U.S.

18:30.443 --> 18:32.673
Who wants to go
to Europe, anyway?

18:35.348 --> 18:38.579
RICHIE: Thank you,
Dewey and the Studebakers.

18:38.718 --> 18:41.278
Now, on to the highlight
of the entire evening.

18:41.420 --> 18:43.149
If the honor guard will take
their positions now,

18:43.289 --> 18:46.782
we can begin our annual
Scabbard and Blade procession.

18:46.926 --> 18:48.451
And don't forget, guys,
comb your hair,

18:48.594 --> 18:50.187
because they're taking pictures
for the year book.

18:50.329 --> 18:52.320
Okay.

18:56.502 --> 18:57.594
You ready, Lori Beth, ready?

18:57.737 --> 18:59.603
All set, Sizzle Lips.

18:59.739 --> 19:02.174
Ralph, wait till you see
what these two are going to do.

19:02.308 --> 19:03.400
When they walk through the line,

19:03.542 --> 19:04.839
they're going to tickle
the guards!

19:04.977 --> 19:07.139
- Yeah! All right.
- Let's go.

19:07.279 --> 19:09.373
How juvenile.

19:09.515 --> 19:11.506
And unladylike.

19:34.173 --> 19:35.607
Ready?

19:35.741 --> 19:37.732
(laughter)

19:43.816 --> 19:45.215
<i>Atten-hut'.!</i>

19:45.351 --> 19:46.477
(chuckles)

19:46.619 --> 19:48.212
No, no, not me! Not me!

19:48.354 --> 19:49.617
You be careful!

19:49.755 --> 19:52.486
That's great.

19:52.625 --> 19:54.354
Well, that was fun.

19:54.493 --> 19:55.858
I never walked
under swords before.

19:55.995 --> 19:57.588
Yeah, I could have died

19:57.730 --> 19:59.425
when Rich and Lori Beth
tickled the guards.

19:59.565 --> 20:01.158
Oh, wasn't that great, Malph?

20:01.300 --> 20:03.860
Yes, it could be construed
as funny.

20:04.003 --> 20:05.971
The old Ralph Malph
might have thought so.

20:06.105 --> 20:09.336
But the new me has changed
quite considerably.

20:09.475 --> 20:10.738
I like the new you, Ralph,

20:10.876 --> 20:12.241
-quite considerably.
- Yeah.

20:12.378 --> 20:14.369
If that's the way you want
to be, that's fine with us.

20:14.513 --> 20:16.242
Yeah. Even if it does take
a little getting used to.

20:16.382 --> 20:17.508
(chuckles)

20:17.650 --> 20:19.880
Does the new Ralph get hungry

20:20.019 --> 20:21.544
like the old Ralph used to?

20:21.687 --> 20:22.984
We're all human, my dear.

20:23.122 --> 20:26.023
Food is life, and life is food.

20:26.158 --> 20:27.751
Hey, listen, I've got an idea.

20:27.893 --> 20:29.952
This is the last dance anyway,
so let's, uh,

20:30.096 --> 20:32.724
have some shishkebob!

20:32.865 --> 20:34.731
Hey, good idea, yeah.

20:34.867 --> 20:36.665
We're going to have
to pass on that, Richard.

20:36.802 --> 20:39.294
Leather and I were planning
on a quiet supper.

20:39.438 --> 20:41.099
- Well, have a good time.
- Okay, take it easy.

20:41.240 --> 20:42.173
- Enjoy your shishkebob.
- Good-bye.

20:42.308 --> 20:43.400
Okay, good night.

20:43.542 --> 20:45.032
Hey, Rich, Rich!

20:45.177 --> 20:47.168
-(shouting, laughter)
-(balloons popping)

20:54.186 --> 20:55.745
(laughter)

20:55.888 --> 20:57.754
Oh, you're so funny.

21:00.259 --> 21:02.023
Did you see where Cuba
is breaking off

21:02.161 --> 21:04.926
all diplomatic ties
with the U.S.?

21:12.271 --> 21:13.932
Well, maybe tomorrow night

21:14.073 --> 21:15.802
you can teach me
another new game, dear.

21:15.941 --> 21:17.602
I mean, learning is such fun.

21:17.743 --> 21:20.838
Marion, would you just keep
your mind on the game, please?

21:20.980 --> 21:22.971
Come on, it's your move.

21:26.886 --> 21:28.354
Gin.

21:32.925 --> 21:35.189
You know, Howard,
that was so nice of you

21:35.327 --> 21:37.295
to discard all those queens.

21:38.731 --> 21:40.028
I don't want
to play anymore, Marion.

21:40.166 --> 21:42.328
I'm going to bed.

21:42.468 --> 21:44.459
You gave me four queens
in a row.

21:44.603 --> 21:46.594
Don't start, Marion.

21:51.610 --> 21:52.702
Thanks for everything, Ralph.

21:52.845 --> 21:54.813
It was fun.
I really had a good time.

21:54.947 --> 21:56.176
Yes, so did I.

21:56.315 --> 21:58.306
And you want to know
what the best part was?

21:58.450 --> 22:00.646
Nobody expected me
to clown around for once.

22:00.786 --> 22:03.221
And I really enjoyed
dressing up.

22:03.355 --> 22:04.447
You know something, Leather?

22:04.590 --> 22:05.716
You look great in a formal.

22:05.858 --> 22:07.223
I mean, you really fit right in.

22:07.359 --> 22:09.657
Well, how about you? You didn't
crack one joke all night.

22:09.795 --> 22:11.058
I know.

22:11.197 --> 22:13.461
And the thing is that people
accepted me that way.

22:13.599 --> 22:15.363
I mean, everyone still liked me.

22:15.501 --> 22:17.833
I was so boring!

22:17.970 --> 22:19.438
I hated myself tonight!

22:19.572 --> 22:20.596
I wasn't any fun.

22:20.739 --> 22:22.764
Not one laugh.

22:22.908 --> 22:23.841
Well, what about me?

22:23.976 --> 22:25.910
Not one...

22:26.045 --> 22:27.638
I was only pretending, too.

22:27.780 --> 22:29.145
And you know what?

22:29.281 --> 22:31.682
I've had a nail stuck
in my heel all evening.

22:31.817 --> 22:33.945
Look.

22:34.086 --> 22:35.520
Are you kidding me?

22:35.654 --> 22:36.849
(laughter)

22:36.989 --> 22:38.753
That's great.

22:38.891 --> 22:40.086
You know something, Leather?

22:40.226 --> 22:41.716
You may have a nail
in your heel,

22:41.861 --> 22:43.192
but you've got a lot of sole.

22:43.329 --> 22:44.524
(laughter)

22:44.663 --> 22:46.654
I've still got it,
I've still got it!

22:46.799 --> 22:48.858
Yes, even in retirement,

22:49.001 --> 22:50.435
I've still got it.

22:50.569 --> 22:52.401
Boy, I've got to tell you,

22:52.538 --> 22:54.063
I'm glad we told each other
the truth.

22:54.206 --> 22:55.674
Yeah, me too, and you know what?

22:55.808 --> 22:58.607
The next time we go out,
we can be ourselves.

22:58.744 --> 22:59.768
You know it.

22:59.912 --> 23:01.107
But will we ever find
an honor guard

23:01.247 --> 23:02.715
with their arms up again...

23:02.848 --> 23:04.782
We can try, Ralph.

23:04.917 --> 23:06.578
All right, all right.

23:06.719 --> 23:08.244
Listen, I got to go.

23:08.387 --> 23:09.718
You know, I feel really naked.

23:09.855 --> 23:11.914
I'm going to go home
and get my rubber nose.

23:12.057 --> 23:13.115
Ralph,

23:13.259 --> 23:15.557
you forgot something.

23:15.694 --> 23:17.685
Oh.

23:17.830 --> 23:19.821
Of course.

23:26.972 --> 23:28.303
Thanks.

23:28.440 --> 23:30.568
You know,
both Ralph Malphs are sweet.

23:30.709 --> 23:34.043
So are both Leather Tuscaderos.

23:34.179 --> 23:36.170
- Good night.
- Good night.

23:42.254 --> 23:44.655
Wait till I kiss you
with my rubber nose on.

23:55.467 --> 23:56.832
Oh, Joanie.

23:56.969 --> 23:57.902
- Hi, Mom and Dad.
- Hi, sweetheart.

23:58.037 --> 23:59.334
Did you have a nice evening?

23:59.471 --> 24:00.632
No.

24:00.773 --> 24:02.366
It's happened the third night
in a row.

24:02.508 --> 24:03.771
I'm going to break off
with Smitty.

24:03.909 --> 24:06.139
Oh, dear, and he seemed
like such a nice boy.

24:06.278 --> 24:07.473
What happened, sweetheart?

24:07.613 --> 24:09.206
Well, we were going
to Inspiration Point

24:09.348 --> 24:11.316
to look at the Big Dipper
through his telescope.

24:11.450 --> 24:12.781
- Yeah?
- And you know what happened?

24:12.918 --> 24:15.285
- What?
- We looked at the Big Dipper.

24:15.421 --> 24:18.413
If you've seen one Milky Way,
you've seen them all!

24:21.427 --> 24:22.861
Howard, she's turning out

24:22.995 --> 24:24.690
just like your side
of the family.

24:26.298 --> 24:28.096
We'll have to have
a talk with her.

24:28.233 --> 24:30.725
Oh, I wouldn't worry
about that, sweetheart.

24:30.869 --> 24:34.305
Not as long as Smitty
carries that telescope.

24:34.440 --> 24:36.568
Marion, it's your move.

24:36.709 --> 24:38.973
Oh, I just love marbles, Howard.

24:39.111 --> 24:41.205
It's Chinese Checkers, Marion.

24:41.347 --> 24:43.475
Well...

24:43.615 --> 24:44.707
whatever it is,

24:44.850 --> 24:48.150
I've got all my marbles
in your little triangle.

24:49.188 --> 24:50.349
I know that.

24:50.489 --> 24:52.389
What are you going
to teach me tomorrow night?

24:52.524 --> 24:54.993
Solitaire, Marion.
