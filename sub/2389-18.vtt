(cork pops)
Whoa, sorry, sorry.

00:02.325 --> 00:04.306
Oh, my God! You know that
there is gonna be champagne

00:04.307 --> 00:06.257
at this party, right?
I know, I know.

00:06.259 --> 00:07.776
But we're gonna get
there and it's gonna be

00:07.778 --> 00:10.061
everyone congratulating
you on your book,

00:10.063 --> 00:12.163
saying, "This is a revelation!

00:12.165 --> 00:14.232
"You're gonna end
poverty in our time.

00:14.234 --> 00:15.650
"This is the greatest book
anyone's ever written

00:15.652 --> 00:17.035
in any genre."

00:17.037 --> 00:18.787
You're the only one
that says that, sweetie.

00:18.789 --> 00:19.788
Well, it's true.

00:19.790 --> 00:21.322
So before I lose you

00:21.324 --> 00:22.991
to your adoring public,

00:22.993 --> 00:24.959
I just want to take
a moment, you and I,

00:24.961 --> 00:28.446
to celebrate the best
year of our lives.

00:29.215 --> 00:30.532
Happy New Year.

00:30.534 --> 00:32.083
Happy New Year.

00:35.421 --> 00:36.888
(grunts)

00:36.890 --> 00:39.424
We go big tonight!

00:39.426 --> 00:41.059
Easy there, buddy.

00:41.061 --> 00:42.927
We're old people, remember?

00:42.929 --> 00:44.763
We haven't even gone
medium sized in forever.

00:44.765 --> 00:48.233
And I cannot carry
you home in this dress.

00:48.235 --> 00:49.317
Sweetie, relax.

00:49.319 --> 00:50.485
I got this.

00:50.487 --> 00:51.986
Yeah, right.

00:51.988 --> 00:54.155
I can see your whole future.

00:54.157 --> 00:57.025
You are gonna be
so hungover tomorrow.

00:57.027 --> 00:58.359
I'm gonna be fine.
Hmm.

00:58.361 --> 01:00.495
I made a vow, remember?

01:00.497 --> 01:01.479
NARRATOR:
<i>Kids...</i>

01:01.481 --> 01:02.597
the story behind that vow

01:02.599 --> 01:03.765
took place the morning

01:03.767 --> 01:05.333
of Barney and Robin's wedding.

01:05.334 --> 01:08.319
<i>You see, after drinking</i>
<i>way too much the night before,</i>

01:08.321 --> 01:10.255
<i>this is</i>
<i>all your Uncle Barney remembers</i>

01:10.257 --> 01:12.757
<i>from the first two hours</i>
<i>of his wedding day.</i>

01:12.759 --> 01:14.976
(gasps)

01:14.978 --> 01:16.211
(roars)

01:19.298 --> 01:20.565
<i>And that's it.</i>

01:20.567 --> 01:21.833
<i>Now here's how the rest of us</i>

01:21.835 --> 01:23.301
<i>remember those two hours.</i>

01:23.303 --> 01:24.519
(tape rewinding)

01:24.521 --> 01:25.653
ROBIN:
Found him.

01:27.723 --> 01:30.241
You know, he looks better
than I thought he would.

01:30.243 --> 01:33.895
Rise and shine.

01:33.897 --> 01:35.697
Up and at 'em,
let's do this.

01:36.732 --> 01:38.233
There's a gas leak!

01:39.318 --> 01:40.685
The building's on fire!

01:42.404 --> 01:43.684
Your shoes don't
match your belt!

01:45.007 --> 01:47.208
(moaning)

01:53.549 --> 01:54.916
BOTH: Uh-oh.

02:11.884 --> 02:13.184
Okay, I think my fiancé

02:13.186 --> 02:14.585
peed himself a little.

02:14.587 --> 02:16.804
Oh, tomorrow
I'm gonna be able to say

02:16.806 --> 02:19.290
my husband
peed himself a little.

02:19.292 --> 02:20.641
(moaning)
Don't worry.

02:20.643 --> 02:22.026
I accidentally spilled
some iced tea on him.

02:22.028 --> 02:23.227
Oh, thank God.

02:23.229 --> 02:24.261
(whispering):
I didn't really spill

02:24.263 --> 02:25.480
some iced tea on him.

02:25.482 --> 02:27.148
Oh, God, this is bad.

02:27.150 --> 02:28.733
We're doing
family wedding pictures

02:28.735 --> 02:31.035
at the lighthouse
in two hours.

02:31.037 --> 02:32.737
My father is paying
for the whole thing.

02:32.739 --> 02:34.271
He's gonna kill Barney
if he doesn't show up.

02:34.273 --> 02:35.957
Come on, your dad's tough.

02:35.959 --> 02:38.209
But won't he understand a
good old fashioned hangover?

02:38.211 --> 02:39.410
My father's recipe

02:39.412 --> 02:40.411
for a Bloody Mary

02:40.413 --> 02:41.612
trades out tomato juice

02:41.614 --> 02:42.797
for wolf's blood.

02:42.799 --> 02:44.332
Ooh.
Ooh.

02:44.334 --> 02:45.466
Bloody Mary?

02:45.468 --> 02:48.469
Sounds more like
a Bloody Scary.

02:49.254 --> 02:50.254
I'm gonna say it again.

02:50.256 --> 02:51.639
Bloody Mary?
Uh, hold on.

02:51.641 --> 02:52.790
You guys are forgetting

02:52.792 --> 02:55.593
Barney Stinson has
a super power.

02:56.645 --> 02:58.596
<i>He can't take a bad photo.</i>

02:59.798 --> 03:01.566
(grunts)
Okay, here.

03:01.568 --> 03:03.134
Watch.

03:06.739 --> 03:07.855
Guys, Barney may be dead.

03:07.857 --> 03:09.073
MARSHALL:
That's it!

03:09.075 --> 03:11.308
You know what? We are all
now seriously too old

03:11.310 --> 03:12.643
to keep doing this to ourselves!

03:12.645 --> 03:14.195
I vow here and now

03:14.197 --> 03:17.815
that I shall never again
get that drunk in my life!

03:17.817 --> 03:20.368
NARRATOR: <i>Yeah, he'd wind up</i>
<i>breaking that vow.</i>

03:20.370 --> 03:22.537
And I will not break that vow

03:22.539 --> 03:25.022
as sure as I will always
have a full head of hair!

03:25.024 --> 03:27.508
WOMAN:
In other elections today,

03:27.510 --> 03:29.660
in the race for New York
State Supreme Court,

03:29.662 --> 03:31.079
Judge Brad Morris...

03:31.081 --> 03:33.114
Mmm, just look at him.

03:33.116 --> 03:34.615
I would love to rub that down.

03:34.617 --> 03:35.917
(clears throat)
Sorry.

03:35.919 --> 03:37.752
Has increased his sizable lead

03:37.754 --> 03:39.771
over Judge Marshall Eriksen.

03:39.773 --> 03:41.839
It was supposed to
be a victory party.

03:41.841 --> 03:43.808
You ran
a great campaign, baby.

03:43.810 --> 03:45.526
Yeah, but it was
the most stressful

03:45.528 --> 03:47.228
three weeks of my life!

03:49.347 --> 03:51.299
And in other results,
a surprise comeback.

03:51.301 --> 03:54.518
We are now ready to call the New
York State Supreme Court race

03:54.520 --> 03:56.404
for Judge Marshall Eriksen.

03:56.406 --> 03:58.122
(all cheering)

03:58.124 --> 04:00.041
We'll go to Judge Eriksen
for a live statement

04:00.043 --> 04:01.793
in just a few minutes.

04:01.795 --> 04:03.744
(slurring):
Come again for Judge Fudge?

04:04.830 --> 04:06.097
As your next commissioner...

04:06.099 --> 04:08.249
State Supreme Court judge.

04:08.251 --> 04:09.867
...of Gotham City...

04:09.869 --> 04:12.053
The State of New York.

04:12.055 --> 04:15.206
...I vow to make
Batman work harder.

04:15.208 --> 04:16.423
I say

04:16.426 --> 04:19.375
shine that Bat-Signal
even for small stuff.

04:19.378 --> 04:21.896
Like, uh, shoveling snow.

04:21.898 --> 04:25.783
Or, like, uh, if a police horse
dumps out in the park.

04:25.785 --> 04:26.734
LILY:
Okay, well, that will be

04:26.736 --> 04:28.319
all at this time, thank you.

04:28.321 --> 04:30.037
That's all.
Okay.

04:30.039 --> 04:31.105
Mmm, good night.

04:31.107 --> 04:32.607
Never again!

04:32.609 --> 04:34.225
I vow it!

04:34.227 --> 04:35.943
I am more worried
about the vows I have to take

04:35.945 --> 04:37.445
with this useless
pile of garbage

04:37.447 --> 04:38.462
a few hours from now.

04:38.464 --> 04:39.697
What do we do?

04:39.699 --> 04:40.832
You guys see the irony here.

04:40.834 --> 04:42.200
The only person
who could possibly get

04:42.202 --> 04:43.668
Barney back on his feet

04:43.670 --> 04:44.619
is Barney.

NARRATOR:
<i>See, over the years,</i>

04:45.872 --> 04:47.038
<i>we'd all come to experience</i>

<i>something Barney called...</i>

04:49.042 --> 04:51.609
Stinson's Hangover Fixer Elixir!

04:51.611 --> 04:52.660
The most effective

04:52.662 --> 04:54.011
post-bender,
head's-too-tender ender

04:54.013 --> 04:55.046
from here to Denver.

04:55.048 --> 04:56.147
What's in it?

04:56.149 --> 04:57.581
Glad you asked.
Ah, I take it back.

04:57.583 --> 04:59.433
Columbia University, 1941...
I take it back, I take it back.

04:59.435 --> 05:01.352
<i>President Franklin</i>
<i>Delano Roosevelt,</i>

05:01.354 --> 05:04.939

05:09.212 --> 05:11.696
<i>And what brilliant scientific</i>
<i>mind did boozy old FDR pick</i>

05:11.698 --> 05:14.532
<i>to head up this historic task?</i>
TED: <i>Look.</i>

05:14.534 --> 05:16.534
My head really hurts.
Let's just speed this along.

05:16.536 --> 05:17.535
You're clearly ripping off

05:17.537 --> 05:19.436
the story
of the Manhattan Project,

05:19.438 --> 05:21.956
which was run
by Dr. Robert Oppenheimer.

05:21.958 --> 05:25.626
So I'm gonna guess it was
your distant relative...

05:26.795 --> 05:29.146
...Barnert Stinsonheimer?

05:29.148 --> 05:32.283
Somebody's read
their history books.

05:32.285 --> 05:34.285
<i>The Too Many Manhattans Project</i>

05:34.287 --> 05:36.637

05:36.639 --> 05:37.922
<i>The first batch exploded.</i>

05:37.924 --> 05:39.924
<i>Which sounded</i>
<i>kind of like this.</i>

05:39.926 --> 05:41.559
Boom!
Oh!

05:41.561 --> 05:42.626
You suck.

05:42.628 --> 05:44.011
Just let me finish.

05:44.013 --> 05:45.796
But the second batch...

05:45.798 --> 05:47.648
<i>sadly also exploded.</i>

05:47.650 --> 05:49.016
Boom!
Oh!

05:49.018 --> 05:50.818
Why are you here right now?

05:50.820 --> 05:52.169
Do you want to hear
the story or not?

05:52.171 --> 05:53.521
Absolutely not. Please leave.

05:53.523 --> 05:54.872
After some trial and error,

05:54.874 --> 05:57.158
<i>Dr. Stinsonheimer finally found</i>

05:57.160 --> 05:58.993
<i>the magic formula.</i>

Funyuns?

06:04.083 --> 06:05.399
Tantrum Soda?

06:05.401 --> 06:06.334
Sure.

06:06.336 --> 06:07.585
In 1941?

06:07.587 --> 06:08.753
Sure.

06:08.755 --> 06:09.987
They haven't made
new Tantrum since then.

06:09.989 --> 06:11.005
That stuff lasts a while.

06:11.007 --> 06:14.141
Anyway, the elixir
was such a success,

06:14.143 --> 06:16.627

06:33.195 --> 06:35.780
I-I feel better.

06:35.782 --> 06:37.648
<i>Over the years,</i>

Like, way better.

06:41.321 --> 06:42.403
What's in this thing again?

06:42.405 --> 06:44.188
Stinson family secret.

06:44.190 --> 06:46.374
Oh, come on, you told me most of
the ingredients in your story.

06:46.376 --> 06:48.075
Just tell me the secret one.

06:48.077 --> 06:49.493
Ha! I'll never tell you.

06:49.495 --> 06:51.963
I'll take it with me
to my grave.

06:51.965 --> 06:52.997
Damn it, Barney!

06:52.999 --> 06:54.332
Why are you always so selfish?!

06:54.334 --> 06:55.716
We are trying to help you!

06:55.718 --> 06:56.784
ROBIN: Okay,
we somehow have

06:56.786 --> 06:57.969
to get this leaky barf bag

06:57.971 --> 06:59.587
back on his feet before
the wedding pictures.

06:59.589 --> 07:02.423
Well, we know what Barney
would want us to do.

07:04.059 --> 07:05.176
WOMAN:
Say cheese.

07:05.178 --> 07:06.594
ALL: Cheese!

07:06.596 --> 07:07.845
ROBIN: <i>No!</i>

07:07.847 --> 07:09.680
We are not doing
Weekend at Barney's!

07:09.682 --> 07:10.898
But that's the dream!

07:10.900 --> 07:12.633
I can't believe
I just said that.

07:12.635 --> 07:14.018
Someone suggest
something useful!

07:14.020 --> 07:15.319
Okay, here's the plan.

07:15.321 --> 07:17.071
Marshall, you and Ted
go gather

07:17.073 --> 07:18.489
the ingredients we do know.

07:18.491 --> 07:19.323
Robin,

07:19.325 --> 07:20.941
you wake up Barney long enough

07:20.943 --> 07:22.693
to find out
the secret ingredient.

07:22.695 --> 07:26.664
And I'll race down to the spa
to keep my 8:15 mani and pedi.

07:26.666 --> 07:27.665
Okay, let's do this!

07:27.667 --> 07:28.699
Bitch?

07:28.701 --> 07:29.867
Walk out that door and I tag in

07:29.869 --> 07:31.118
Zabka as my maid of honor.

07:31.120 --> 07:33.921
Okay, let's start simple.

07:33.923 --> 07:35.039
Fresh ocean air.

07:35.041 --> 07:36.040
Come on, baby.

07:36.042 --> 07:37.541
BOTH:
Come on, honey.

07:37.543 --> 07:39.210
Come on, love, yeah.
Baby, baby.

07:41.380 --> 07:42.847
I'll get the elevator.

07:42.849 --> 07:45.132
Oh, I should get some water.

07:52.545 --> 07:54.329
Okay, so...

07:54.331 --> 07:56.381
accidentally throwing
Barney down the stairs

07:56.383 --> 07:58.584
did not wake him up.

07:58.586 --> 08:00.836
Nor did banging his
head on each step

08:00.838 --> 08:02.237
as we dragged him back up here.

08:02.239 --> 08:04.973
So, how do we
wake him up long enough

08:04.975 --> 08:06.775
to tell us the final ingredient?

08:06.777 --> 08:08.377
You know, when my sister and I

08:08.379 --> 08:10.178
had trouble getting up
for school,

08:10.180 --> 08:12.297
my dad a few cute little tricks.

08:16.152 --> 08:18.353
(growling)

08:18.355 --> 08:19.438
I'll do it!

08:19.440 --> 08:21.490
I swear to God I'll do it!

08:21.492 --> 08:23.492
Your dad used to do this to you?

08:23.494 --> 08:25.360
Well, it was with
a Cabbage Patch doll and an ax.

08:25.362 --> 08:26.411
But same idea. Trust me.

08:26.413 --> 08:28.647
I was never late
for kindergarten again.

08:28.649 --> 08:31.116
What? Come on.

08:31.118 --> 08:33.501
(Barney moaning)

08:33.504 --> 08:35.153
(groans)

08:35.155 --> 08:36.371
I second Marshall's vow.

08:36.373 --> 08:39.508
I will never, ever get
that drunk again.

08:39.510 --> 08:41.476
NARRATOR:
<i>Yeah. She would.</i>

08:41.477 --> 08:43.595
LILY:
<i>My baby boy's</i>

08:43.597 --> 08:44.846
in college.

08:44.848 --> 08:46.064
Did you pack enough undies?

08:46.066 --> 08:47.432
Yes, Mom.
(shushes)

08:47.434 --> 08:49.868
Your father did a lot of puking

08:49.870 --> 08:51.887
in these hallowed halls.

08:51.889 --> 08:54.005
From-from binge studying.

08:54.007 --> 08:55.857
(quietly):
Saved it.

08:55.859 --> 08:56.858
That reminds me, mister.

08:56.860 --> 08:58.510
No underage drinking.

08:58.512 --> 09:00.312
No good comes
from hanging out

09:00.314 --> 09:02.314
in bars and getting drunk.

09:02.316 --> 09:05.016
But every story
from your 20s starts in a bar.

09:05.018 --> 09:06.401
Listen to your mother.

09:06.403 --> 09:08.820
Oh, what are we gonna do
without you in the house?

09:08.822 --> 09:09.871
(groans)

09:09.873 --> 09:12.240
<i>We got him out of the house!</i>
<i>Drink up!</i>

09:14.026 --> 09:15.294
(grunts)

09:15.296 --> 09:16.678
(whoops)

09:16.680 --> 09:19.214
Oh...

09:21.167 --> 09:24.403
You son of a bitch!
You son of a me!

09:24.405 --> 09:26.705
All right, we got most
of the ingredients on our list.

09:26.707 --> 09:28.674
Ginger, bananas, Funyuns.

09:28.676 --> 09:30.709
I cannot believe
that minimart sold Tantrum.

09:30.711 --> 09:32.394
It's been discontinued
for years.

09:32.396 --> 09:33.378
Uh, hey.
(clears throat)

09:33.380 --> 09:35.764
Will you, uh,
toss me that bottle?

09:35.766 --> 09:37.399
Oh. Yeah, we haven't
done this forever.

09:37.401 --> 09:38.934
(smacks lips)

09:38.936 --> 09:40.018
Dude!

09:40.020 --> 09:40.986
You're a grown man.

09:40.988 --> 09:42.254
Why you throwing a Tantrum?

09:42.256 --> 09:43.522
Nice!

09:43.524 --> 09:44.606
So awesome!

09:44.608 --> 09:45.657
So awesome!

09:45.659 --> 09:46.692
Okay, there's only

09:46.694 --> 09:48.410
one more item on the list and...

09:48.412 --> 09:50.512
it's an odd one.

09:50.514 --> 09:52.481
Grease?
Grease.

09:52.483 --> 09:55.000
At the Farhampton Inn,
we don't cook with grease.

09:55.002 --> 09:57.002
Our menu is organic.

09:57.004 --> 09:58.787
Farm to table, locally grown.

09:58.789 --> 10:01.072
No "grease."

10:01.074 --> 10:02.090
Sir,

10:02.092 --> 10:03.792
I am from Minnesota,

10:03.794 --> 10:05.711
where every meal
is cooked with grease.

10:05.713 --> 10:08.296
And my father dubbed
that food the tastiest eats

10:08.298 --> 10:11.266
in the whole
gosh darn world, so...

10:11.268 --> 10:12.634
And how is your father's health?

10:15.104 --> 10:16.605
Point is,
it tastes really good.

10:16.607 --> 10:17.856
Also, uh,

10:17.858 --> 10:19.791
we need it to help a friend
recover from a hangover.

10:19.793 --> 10:21.693
Wait a second.

10:21.695 --> 10:23.395
There's bacon right here.

10:23.397 --> 10:24.646
And where there's bacon,

10:24.648 --> 10:25.831
there's bacon grease.

10:25.833 --> 10:27.265
Which we throw out.

10:27.267 --> 10:29.484
And we aren't making
any more bacon today.

10:29.486 --> 10:32.204
Not unless it all somehow gets
eaten in the ten minutes

10:32.206 --> 10:34.406
before breakfast is over.

10:35.908 --> 10:37.275
No, no, no!

10:37.277 --> 10:38.660
Ted, do not give me that look!

10:38.662 --> 10:39.878
A mountain of food.

10:39.880 --> 10:41.163
A ticking clock? Come on!

10:41.165 --> 10:42.414
You live for this stuff!

10:42.416 --> 10:44.549
No, I'm not a wild animal.

10:44.551 --> 10:46.718
I'm a Columbia-educated lawyer,

10:46.720 --> 10:49.705
poised to become a judge
before age 35.

10:49.707 --> 10:51.122
And remind me,
how did you celebrate

10:51.124 --> 10:52.641
getting accepted into Columbia?

10:52.643 --> 10:55.310
You eat one
eight-pound block of fudge

10:55.312 --> 10:57.596
in 12 minutes
and you're marked for life.

10:57.598 --> 10:59.564
You're not marked for life...

10:59.566 --> 11:00.632
Big Fudge.

11:00.634 --> 11:01.817
I'm out, okay?

11:01.819 --> 11:02.934
You eat the bacon.

11:02.936 --> 11:04.486
You know I can't.

11:04.488 --> 11:05.654
I'm allergic.
Ted.

11:05.656 --> 11:07.272
I've been trying
to tell you this for years.

11:07.274 --> 11:09.074
Your bacon allergy is a lie

11:09.076 --> 11:11.326
your mother made up
so you'd eat healthy as a kid.

11:11.328 --> 11:13.578
No, I'm just allergic
to a lot of stuff.

11:13.580 --> 11:14.979
Bacon, doughnuts,

11:14.981 --> 11:17.249
Halloween candy.

11:17.251 --> 11:19.334
Not saying thank you.

11:19.336 --> 11:21.002
Oh, my God!

11:21.004 --> 11:22.320
That bitch lied to me!

11:23.122 --> 11:25.257
Okay, I'll-I'll do it.

11:25.259 --> 11:27.826
But I... look, I don't, I don't
even know if I'll like bacon.

11:30.596 --> 11:31.596
(sniffs)

11:31.598 --> 11:33.632
Mm-hmm.

11:34.817 --> 11:36.768
What do you think?

11:36.770 --> 11:38.837
(choir humming)

11:38.839 --> 11:41.339
I have seen the face of God.

11:43.726 --> 11:47.162
Okay, there is one thing
we haven't tried yet.

11:47.164 --> 11:49.064
Making out with each other.

11:49.066 --> 11:50.899
You really think
that will wake him up?

11:50.901 --> 11:52.134
Wake up who now?

11:52.136 --> 11:54.352
(Barney moaning)

11:54.354 --> 11:55.370
(groans)

11:55.372 --> 11:57.322
Look at this soggy bag of snot.

11:57.324 --> 11:59.241
That's it,
I am joining Marshall's vow.

11:59.243 --> 12:02.377
I am never, ever getting
that drunk again.

12:02.379 --> 12:05.313
NARRATOR: <i>Kids, you see</i>
<i>where this is going.</i>

12:08.501 --> 12:10.669
Did last night really happen?

12:10.671 --> 12:12.921
I think so.

12:12.923 --> 12:14.873
Look, let's just agree.

12:14.875 --> 12:17.359
Absolute silence for
the rest of the day.

12:17.361 --> 12:18.727
(baby crying)

12:18.729 --> 12:20.545
(groans)
(laughs)

12:20.547 --> 12:22.264
Every time.

12:22.266 --> 12:23.415
You want me to get her?

12:23.417 --> 12:25.567
No, I got her.

12:25.569 --> 12:28.220
(grunts)

12:28.222 --> 12:30.739
Yeah, I know, I know.

12:30.741 --> 12:32.958
(shushing)

12:35.611 --> 12:37.295
Hey, Barney?

12:37.297 --> 12:38.079
Yeah?

12:38.081 --> 12:39.948
Whose baby is this?

12:46.339 --> 12:48.757
Uh, pardon.

12:50.209 --> 12:51.593
(speaks French)

12:51.595 --> 12:53.445
How could you, Mom?!

12:53.447 --> 12:54.563
You had the map

12:54.565 --> 12:56.748
to heaven
and you never showed me the way.

12:56.750 --> 12:58.767
May you rot
in the bacon-less hell

12:58.769 --> 13:01.386
that I've lived in
my entire life.

13:01.388 --> 13:03.588
Yeah, they-they, uh,
crisp it up real nice here.

13:03.590 --> 13:04.639
Don't they?
Mm-hmm.

13:04.641 --> 13:05.724
What is that--
applewood smoked?

13:05.726 --> 13:06.775
You know what, Ted,

13:06.777 --> 13:08.226
you've been going
at it real hard.

13:08.228 --> 13:09.761
Why don't you take a breather?

13:09.763 --> 13:11.095
And I'll drive us home.

13:11.097 --> 13:12.881
(growls)

13:13.916 --> 13:15.600
Well, congratulations.

13:15.602 --> 13:17.202
Here's your grease.
(grunts)

13:17.204 --> 13:18.286
No!

13:18.288 --> 13:20.271
I don't want to lose a finger.
(grunts)

13:20.273 --> 13:21.540
Here.
Thanks.

13:21.542 --> 13:22.490
All right, Ted, let's go.

13:22.492 --> 13:23.608
No, no!

13:24.660 --> 13:26.778
I finally found
the one, Marshall.

13:26.780 --> 13:29.297
Her name is Bacon.

13:29.299 --> 13:32.467
You know, this would go great on
one of my mom's LT sandwiches.

13:32.469 --> 13:33.885
Buddy, you got to take it easy.

13:33.887 --> 13:35.003
Never!

13:35.005 --> 13:37.339
I got a lifetime without bacon
to make up for.

13:37.341 --> 13:39.057
I will keep eating and eating

13:39.059 --> 13:40.809
and eating...
Oh, God, help me.

13:40.811 --> 13:41.843
I'm going down.

13:41.845 --> 13:43.728
NARRATOR:
<i>And that's the first</i>

13:43.730 --> 13:50.986
<i>and last time I ever ate bacon.</i>

13:50.988 --> 13:52.320
Not everything.

13:53.155 --> 13:54.856
Lily Aldrin?

13:54.858 --> 13:56.191
Let's make out.

13:56.193 --> 13:57.642
(gasps)

13:57.644 --> 13:59.077
Are you sure?!

13:59.079 --> 14:00.579
Yeah, baby, I'm sure.

14:00.581 --> 14:02.330
Um...

14:02.332 --> 14:04.249
okay, well, you know what?
I mean...

14:04.251 --> 14:06.701
it probably won't even work.

14:06.703 --> 14:08.319
And it was stupid.

14:08.321 --> 14:09.704
I'm stupid.

14:09.706 --> 14:11.456
(shushing)

14:11.458 --> 14:12.958
You're beautiful.

14:17.463 --> 14:18.713
(gasps)

14:18.715 --> 14:20.849
More, more, more, more,
more, more, more, more.

14:20.851 --> 14:21.850
Whoa, he's awake!

14:21.852 --> 14:23.218
How'd you do it?!

14:23.220 --> 14:24.269
Nothing special.

14:24.271 --> 14:25.186
Hydration, patience.

14:25.188 --> 14:26.504
Quick, before he
passes out again.

14:26.506 --> 14:27.839
Barney!
(grunts)

14:27.841 --> 14:29.724
What's the secret ingredient

14:29.726 --> 14:32.477
in Stinson's
Hangover Fixer Elixir?

14:32.479 --> 14:33.845
Come on, stay with us.

14:33.847 --> 14:36.364
The secret ingredient

14:36.366 --> 14:37.616
is...

14:37.618 --> 14:39.050
nothing.

14:39.052 --> 14:39.918
ALL: Huh?

14:39.920 --> 14:42.287
I ate too much bacon.

14:42.289 --> 14:44.623
Stinson's Hangover Fixer Elixir

14:44.625 --> 14:47.859
is a lie.

14:47.861 --> 14:50.462
That's the secret.

14:50.464 --> 14:52.380
You...

14:52.382 --> 14:54.749
You know, I could use
a little lie-down myself.

14:57.697 --> 15:01.294
So, Stinson's Hangover
Fixer Elixir is a lie?

15:01.295 --> 15:03.345
Why would you lie about that?

15:03.347 --> 15:04.380
Just to mess with us?

15:04.382 --> 15:05.764
Like that one jerk
in every high school

15:05.766 --> 15:07.082
who brings in fake mushrooms

15:07.084 --> 15:08.217
just to see
who's gullible enough

15:08.219 --> 15:09.351
to think they're tripping?

15:09.353 --> 15:11.387
Damn you, Ollie Gunderson.

15:11.389 --> 15:13.972
I knew those shrooms
tasted like Sea-Monkeys.

15:13.974 --> 15:15.691
How do you know
what Sea-Monkeys taste like?

15:15.693 --> 15:17.476
My older brothers are not...

15:17.478 --> 15:19.361
the best people.

15:19.363 --> 15:20.479
Why did you lie?

15:20.481 --> 15:22.481
I...

15:22.483 --> 15:25.868
love you guys.

15:26.720 --> 15:29.121
He loves us?

15:29.123 --> 15:30.656
Let's throw him down
the stairs again.

15:30.658 --> 15:31.824
Yeah!
Yeah!

15:31.826 --> 15:32.958
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait!
Think about it.

15:32.960 --> 15:34.159
The first time Barney

15:34.161 --> 15:35.160
gave us that drink,

15:35.162 --> 15:36.211
those hangovers all happened

15:36.213 --> 15:38.130
at the worst possible moments.

15:38.132 --> 15:40.299
<i>Remember? Marshall thought</i>
<i>he botched day two</i>

15:40.301 --> 15:43.452
<i>of the bar exam, so he freaked</i>
<i>out that night and got wasted?</i>

15:43.454 --> 15:45.504
Now I'm gonna miss
the last day of the bar?

15:45.506 --> 15:46.755
I'll never be a lawyer!

15:46.757 --> 15:49.174
I should just go back to being
a manager at Structure.

15:49.176 --> 15:51.110
That ten percent
off all vests sale?

15:51.112 --> 15:52.478
That was my idea!

15:52.480 --> 15:53.679
As was cutting the arms off

15:53.681 --> 15:54.980
all the shirts
that weren't selling.

15:54.982 --> 15:56.548
That's where I belong.

15:56.550 --> 15:58.650
No, Marshall.

15:58.652 --> 16:00.269
You're gonna be a lawyer.

16:00.271 --> 16:01.970
(groans)
No, I can't do it.

16:01.972 --> 16:04.773
Yes, you can. Your first day
back live on the air

16:04.775 --> 16:07.242
is gonna be legend--
wait for it--

16:07.244 --> 16:08.310
dary!

16:08.312 --> 16:10.045
Your kindergarten field trip

16:10.047 --> 16:12.030
to the jackhammer and
siren museum today...

16:12.032 --> 16:12.998
(groans)

16:13.000 --> 16:15.284
...is gonna be legendary.

16:15.286 --> 16:16.668
No, it's not.

16:16.670 --> 16:18.704
Nothing's ever gonna
be legendary again.

16:18.706 --> 16:21.090
I-I'm never gonna
recover from this.

16:21.092 --> 16:22.458
It's just a hangover, Ted.

16:22.460 --> 16:23.675
Not that!

16:23.677 --> 16:26.128
I got left at the altar, Barney.

16:26.130 --> 16:29.848
I'm now a guy
who got left at the altar.

16:29.850 --> 16:32.217
There's no coming back
from that.

16:32.219 --> 16:34.520
Drink this.

16:34.522 --> 16:36.655
You're gonna be okay.

16:37.840 --> 16:40.526
Barney made up the Stinson's
Hangover Fixer Elixir

16:40.528 --> 16:42.895
so we would all believe
that we could rally.

16:42.897 --> 16:46.148
I mean, even though it's fake,
it-it worked.

16:46.150 --> 16:47.649
Like-like Dumbo's feather.

16:47.651 --> 16:49.618
Dum-bro's feather.

16:49.620 --> 16:50.652
A placebo.

16:50.654 --> 16:52.237
Place-bro.

16:52.239 --> 16:53.322
A sugar pill.

16:53.324 --> 16:54.823
(gasps)

16:54.825 --> 16:56.291
I...

16:56.293 --> 16:58.427
He lied so we'd be okay.

16:58.429 --> 16:59.828
Hmm.

16:59.830 --> 17:02.164
Barney does love us.

17:02.166 --> 17:05.416
I wish we could help him out
the way he helped us.

17:05.419 --> 17:07.636
But the wedding photos
are in 20 minutes.

17:07.637 --> 17:09.505
(groans)
My dad's gonna be so pissed.

17:09.507 --> 17:10.923
Yup.

17:10.925 --> 17:13.008
Barney's a dead man.

17:18.798 --> 17:21.867
(camera shutter clicking)

17:25.905 --> 17:27.138
Barney?

17:27.141 --> 17:28.523
You were always a bit...

17:28.526 --> 17:30.993
chatty and blond

17:30.995 --> 17:32.661
for my taste. Like a woman.

17:32.663 --> 17:35.214
But this new side of you--

17:35.216 --> 17:36.532
quiet,

17:36.534 --> 17:37.916
steady?

17:37.918 --> 17:39.952
I like it!

17:39.954 --> 17:43.205
You've earned my
respect today, son.

17:43.207 --> 17:44.506
I request the highest of fives.

17:44.508 --> 17:45.907
Oh, no.
Stay cool.

17:45.909 --> 17:49.228
I got this.

17:54.684 --> 17:56.401
BARNEY:
<i>I don't believe this.</i>

17:56.403 --> 17:57.936
You did Weekend at Barney's.

17:57.938 --> 17:59.354
And it worked.

17:59.356 --> 18:02.474
God, today's gonna be
all downhill from here.

18:02.476 --> 18:04.009
That's what the bride
wants to hear.

18:04.011 --> 18:05.310
No, that's not what I meant.

18:05.312 --> 18:07.095
I just mean Weekend at Barney's

18:07.097 --> 18:09.865
is a thousand times more amazing
than our wedding could ever be.

18:09.867 --> 18:12.767
I'm gonna get some more coffee.
I can't wait to see the photos!

18:15.288 --> 18:17.122
Well, he bought it.

18:17.124 --> 18:18.407
We lied out of love.

18:18.409 --> 18:19.708
Look how happy he is.

18:19.710 --> 18:21.243
I mean, he has no idea
we had to cancel

18:21.245 --> 18:22.995
the wedding photos
and my dad was so angry,

18:22.997 --> 18:25.280
he came up to our room
and kicked Barney in the crotch.

18:25.282 --> 18:28.417
And the best part is
your dad has no idea.

18:28.419 --> 18:30.152
He still loves me.

18:30.154 --> 18:33.188
Hey, do anyone else's
balls hurt?

18:33.190 --> 18:34.590
MARSHALL:
And, look,

18:34.592 --> 18:35.641
some good came out of all this.

18:35.643 --> 18:37.175
Seeing you like that,
we all vowed

18:37.177 --> 18:39.294
never to get that drunk again.

18:39.296 --> 18:40.795
Well, actually I didn't.

18:40.797 --> 18:42.064
But I will now.

18:42.066 --> 18:43.098
Never again.

18:43.100 --> 18:44.850
Never again. Never again.
Never... Ow!

18:44.852 --> 18:46.518
NARRATOR: <i>Kids, no matter</i>
<i>how hard we try,</i>

18:46.520 --> 18:49.071
<i>even the best of us go</i>
<i>a little too wild sometimes.</i>

18:49.073 --> 18:52.024
<i>And in those moments,</i>
<i>we all need</i>

18:52.026 --> 18:54.409
<i>someone who loves us</i>
<i>to help us rally.</i>

18:54.411 --> 18:56.578
(groans)

18:58.514 --> 19:00.616
(whispers): Happy New Year.
Okay.

19:00.618 --> 19:02.034
That was, that was way too loud.

19:02.036 --> 19:04.119
You're practically screaming.

19:04.121 --> 19:05.837
What you need

19:05.839 --> 19:08.707
is Stinson's
Hangover Fixer Elixir.

19:08.709 --> 19:10.876
<i>Even if that means lying</i>
<i>once in a while.</i>

19:10.878 --> 19:12.094
Does it work?

19:12.096 --> 19:13.161
Totally works.

19:14.830 --> 19:16.998
(gags)

19:17.000 --> 19:18.634
It's normal,
it's totally normal.

19:18.636 --> 19:21.353
(groans)

19:22.255 --> 19:24.172
(laughs)
I love you so much.

19:24.174 --> 19:25.140
I love you, too.

19:25.142 --> 19:27.442
Whoop, whoop.

19:27.444 --> 19:28.694
Better drink it fast.

19:28.696 --> 19:29.478
BOTH: Mommy!

19:29.480 --> 19:30.696
Hey, look who it is!

19:30.698 --> 19:32.064
Get her!

19:32.066 --> 19:34.199
(all clamoring)

19:37.476 --> 19:38.837
I can't believe we kissed today.

19:39.464 --> 19:41.548
Weird.

19:41.550 --> 19:43.166
I-I feel kind of bad

19:43.168 --> 19:45.719
that, um,
Ted and Marshall missed it.

19:45.721 --> 19:48.054
Hey, we should kiss
one more time

19:48.056 --> 19:51.508
in front of them just to,
like, blow their minds.

19:51.510 --> 19:53.226
Right?

19:53.228 --> 19:54.394
Nah, I don't think so.

19:54.396 --> 19:56.212
Exactly, totally.

19:56.214 --> 19:59.566
Ha-ha, guys, you don't get
to see this kiss either.

19:59.568 --> 20:01.217
So, where should we go?

20:01.219 --> 20:03.186
Closet, patio?

20:03.188 --> 20:04.388
Ooh, I think the sauna's open.

20:04.389 --> 20:05.655
Well, I... actually...

20:05.657 --> 20:09.359
to be honest,
it-it felt kind of weird to me.

20:09.361 --> 20:10.560
Once was enough.

20:10.562 --> 20:11.694
Totally.

20:11.696 --> 20:12.779
We could kiss.

20:12.781 --> 20:13.780
We could not kiss.

20:13.782 --> 20:15.365
We could kiss.

20:15.367 --> 20:16.399
Doesn't matter to me.

20:16.401 --> 20:17.333
It's stupid.

20:17.335 --> 20:18.785
I'm stupid.

20:22.041 --> 20:24.224
So stupid.
