10:58.133 --> 10:59.767
THAT'S
YOUR FATHER?

10:59.767 --> 11:00.834
HEY, DAD.

11:00.834 --> 11:02.300
NO. NO, DON'T
CALL HIM OVER.

11:02.300 --> 11:03.400
HE HATES ME.

11:03.400 --> 11:05.567
WHY DO YOU GUYS HAVE
A PICTURE OF MY DAD?

11:05.567 --> 11:06.500
DAD, HURRY.

11:07.867 --> 11:10.000
THIS BOY
BOTHERING YOU?

11:10.000 --> 11:12.700
I JUST STOPPED HERE
FOR LUNCH.

11:14.033 --> 11:15.600
THIS IS
CHET HUNTER'S SON.

11:15.600 --> 11:17.700
YES, OF COURSE HE IS.

11:17.700 --> 11:19.233
I KNEW
YOU LOOKED FAMILIAR.

11:19.233 --> 11:20.400
CHET'S BEEN SHOWING US
PICTURES OF YOU

11:20.400 --> 11:21.900
FOR I DON'T KNOW
HOW LONG.

11:21.900 --> 11:23.000
I LIKE THE ONE

11:23.000 --> 11:26.200
WHERE YOU'RE GETTING
A BATH IN THE SINK.

11:26.200 --> 11:27.200
GREAT.

11:27.200 --> 11:28.233
YOU'RE SHAWN.
YEAH.

11:28.233 --> 11:29.567
HOW'S
MEDICAL SCHOOL?

11:29.567 --> 11:31.300
ACTUALLY,
IT'S JUST COLLEGE.

11:31.300 --> 11:33.900
CHET ALWAYS TELLS
A GOOD STORY.

11:33.900 --> 11:35.867
AND YOU'RE CORY.
YEAH.

11:35.867 --> 11:38.133
THE KID SHAWN'S
ALWAYS GETTING
OUT OF THEM SCRAPES.

11:40.100 --> 11:41.500
UM, ACTUALLY--

11:41.500 --> 11:44.100
HOW COME THERE'S
A PICTURE OF MY DAD
IN THIS TRUCK STOP?

11:44.100 --> 11:45.734
CHET WOULDN'T
DRIVE HIS RIG

11:45.734 --> 11:47.934
BETWEEN PENNSYLVANIA
AND OHIO WITHOUT
STOPPING HERE

11:47.934 --> 11:50.100
AND TELLING US
SOME OF HIS LATEST
ADVENTURES, RIGHT?

11:50.100 --> 11:51.567
THAT'S RIGHT.

11:51.567 --> 11:54.300
HE ALSO SAID
THAT SHAWN WAS PERFECT
FOR ONE OF YOUR DAUGHTERS,

11:54.300 --> 11:55.467
AS I RECALL.

11:55.467 --> 11:57.600
I DON'T RECALL THAT.

11:57.600 --> 11:59.967
I RECALL THAT.

11:59.967 --> 12:01.834
WHICH ONE?

12:03.200 --> 12:04.900
IT WAS ME.

12:05.967 --> 12:08.133
WELL, DAD ALWAYS
DID HAVE GOOD TASTE.

12:08.133 --> 12:09.667
THANKS.

12:09.667 --> 12:12.100
NOW HE'S NEVER
COMING HOME.

12:12.100 --> 12:13.834
SO, WHAT'S YOUR DADDY
UP TO NOW?

12:15.200 --> 12:18.367
OH, CORY, NONE
OF THESE PEOPLE KNOW.

12:18.367 --> 12:19.500
NO, THEY DON'T.

12:19.500 --> 12:20.867
KNOW WHAT?

12:20.867 --> 12:22.500
WELL, I--

12:22.500 --> 12:24.767
I HATE TO
TELL YOU THIS, BUT...

12:26.200 --> 12:28.100
MY DAD DIED LAST WEEK.

12:32.834 --> 12:34.767
SO, WHO SHOT HIM?

12:34.767 --> 12:36.600
[LAUGHTER]

12:37.734 --> 12:39.600
IS IT OK THAT
PEOPLE ARE LAUGHING?

12:39.600 --> 12:41.100
OF COURSE IT'S OK.

12:41.100 --> 12:43.100
JUST THINKING ABOUT THAT
UGLY SON OF A GUN'S FACE

12:43.100 --> 12:44.400
IS ENOUGH
TO MAKE YOU LAUGH.

12:46.500 --> 12:48.033
IS IT OK
THAT I'M LAUGHING?

12:48.033 --> 12:49.200
[SIGHS]

12:49.200 --> 12:52.000
YOUR FATHER DIED, SHAWN,
BUT HE AIN'T GONE.

12:52.000 --> 12:54.967
WHEN SOMEONE YOU LOVE
LEAVES YOU,

12:54.967 --> 12:56.367
THEY'RE NEVER GONE.

12:56.367 --> 12:57.867
THEY STAY RIGHT HERE.

12:57.867 --> 12:59.734
YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN?

12:59.734 --> 13:01.967
HOW WELL DID YOU GUYS
KNOW MY DAD?

13:01.967 --> 13:03.200
PRETTY WELL. HE WAS--

13:03.200 --> 13:04.900
HE WAS ALWAYS RUNNING
FROM SOMETHING.

13:04.900 --> 13:06.800
HE HAD THAT WAY
ABOUT HIM.

13:06.800 --> 13:09.233
I ALWAYS THOUGHT HE WAS
RUNNING <i>FOR </i>SOMETHING.

13:09.233 --> 13:10.367
FOR WHAT?

13:10.367 --> 13:11.400
YOU.

13:11.400 --> 13:14.500
YOU WERE ALL
HE TALKED ABOUT, KID.

13:14.500 --> 13:17.367
YOUR FATHER WANTED
TO BE PERFECT FOR YOU.

13:17.367 --> 13:19.200
WELL, HE WOULD'VE
BEEN PERFECT

13:19.200 --> 13:21.800
IF HE HAD JUST
BEEN THERE FOR ME.

13:21.800 --> 13:23.400
WELL, CHET
MAY NOT BE HERE NOW,

13:23.400 --> 13:26.467
BUT THE MAN
DESERVES A TOAST.

13:26.467 --> 13:27.767
DEFINITELY.

13:27.767 --> 13:29.834
BUT I'M HORRIBLE
AT THESE THINGS.

13:29.834 --> 13:33.367
CORY, WOULD YOU
SAY SOMETHING?

13:33.367 --> 13:35.734
NO. I'M MAD
AT YOU, SHAWN.

13:38.500 --> 13:39.700
ARE YOU MAD AT HIM?

13:41.967 --> 13:43.200
NO.

13:43.200 --> 13:45.000
DO ME THE HONOR
OF A TOAST.

13:45.000 --> 13:46.834
ALL RIGHT.

13:48.500 --> 13:52.000
CHET HUNTER WAS...
NOT A SAINT.

13:54.000 --> 13:57.967
BUT, UH, HE LOVED SHAWN AS
MUCH AS HE POSSIBLY COULD.

13:57.967 --> 14:00.600
AND EVEN IF HE WASN'T
ALWAYS AROUND TO SHOW IT...

14:01.967 --> 14:04.700
WE ALL KNOW
HE WANTED TO BE.

14:04.700 --> 14:06.300
AND I'M SURE,
IF HE COULD,

14:06.300 --> 14:09.667
HE'D BE RIGHT HERE
WITH YOU RIGHT NOW.

14:09.667 --> 14:11.300
I BELIEVE THAT.

14:11.300 --> 14:14.233
I BELIEVE THAT, TOO.

14:14.233 --> 14:16.133
TO CHET HUNTER,

14:16.133 --> 14:17.600
SHAWN'S FATHER.

14:17.600 --> 14:19.200
All: HEAR, HEAR!

14:19.200 --> 14:21.033
TO CHET HUNTER.

14:22.300 --> 14:23.900
MY FATHER.

14:25.934 --> 14:28.500
ERIC, I AM REALLY GLAD THAT
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THIS.

14:28.500 --> 14:30.100
YEAH. SEE, WE
DIDN'T WANNA TELL YOU

14:30.100 --> 14:32.500
'CAUSE WE THOUGHT
IT WOULD MAKE IT
ALL WEIRD BETWEEN US.

14:32.500 --> 14:34.500
YOU KNOW, WHEN I SAW
YOU GUYS KISSING,

14:34.500 --> 14:35.500
IT BOTHERED ME.

14:35.500 --> 14:36.800
AND I DIDN'T
KNOW WHY.

14:36.800 --> 14:38.200
I DIDN'T KNOW IF,
LIKE, I WAS JEALOUS

14:38.200 --> 14:40.367
OR I FELT BETRAYED
OR--

14:40.367 --> 14:41.967
UH, YOU KNOW
WHAT I THINK IT WAS?

14:41.967 --> 14:44.900
I THINK THAT JACK JUST--
HE REALLY NEEDED A FRIEND,

14:44.900 --> 14:46.900
AND I TRIED
TO BE THAT FOR HIM.

14:46.900 --> 14:49.233
WELL, YOU'RE
A GOOD FRIEND.

14:50.467 --> 14:51.967
YOU SAW ME, ERIC.

14:51.967 --> 14:53.867
I WAS IN A DARK PLACE.

14:53.867 --> 14:55.133
RIGHT. AND YOU KNOW WHAT,
COME TO THINK OF IT--

14:55.133 --> 14:57.467
I'LL ADMIT IT--
I MAY HAVE GONE
A LITTLE TOO FAR.

14:57.467 --> 14:59.300
MAYBE I DID, TOO.

14:59.300 --> 15:00.934
YEAH? REALLY?

15:00.934 --> 15:04.200
SO...YOU JUST
ALL WENT TOO FAR?

15:04.200 --> 15:05.500
YEAH.

15:05.500 --> 15:06.700
YEAH.

15:06.700 --> 15:08.400
YEAH.

15:08.400 --> 15:10.867
SO THEN WE'RE
STILL 3 FRIENDS.

15:10.867 --> 15:12.800
I THINK WE'RE BETTER FRIENDS
THAN WE EVER HAVE BEEN.

15:12.800 --> 15:16.033
YEAH.
YOU KNOW SOMETHING?

15:16.033 --> 15:17.367
THIS TALKING THING,
THIS FEELS REALLY GOOD.

15:17.367 --> 15:19.000
WE SHOULD BE ABLE
TO TALK ABOUT STUFF

15:19.000 --> 15:20.200
WHEN THEY
JUST GO TOO FAR.

15:21.867 --> 15:22.900
YEAH.

15:22.900 --> 15:23.900
YEAH.

15:23.900 --> 15:25.233
YEAH.

15:25.233 --> 15:26.800
OK. WELL, UM,

15:26.800 --> 15:28.300
I GOT SOME STUFF
IN THE DRYER,

15:28.300 --> 15:31.467
SO I'M GONNA GO,
ALL RIGHT?

15:38.500 --> 15:40.467
THAT'S--THAT'S GOOD.
THAT'S REALLY GOOD.

15:40.467 --> 15:43.300
YEAH, YOU KNOW, UM,
I REALLY RESPECT THAT

15:43.300 --> 15:44.834
WHEN SOMEBODY
CAN JUST COME OUT

15:44.834 --> 15:48.400
AND SAY HOW THEY'RE
FEELING. NO GAMES.

15:48.400 --> 15:50.000
I WANNA KISS YOU.

15:50.000 --> 15:52.233
I WANNA KISS YOU,
TOO, JACK.

15:56.767 --> 15:58.367
I'M ON A JOURNEY,
CORY,

15:58.367 --> 16:00.967
SO I'VE GOTTA STAY
ON THIS JOURNEY.

16:00.967 --> 16:02.567
OH, YOU'RE
ON A JOURNEY.

16:02.567 --> 16:04.100
IT WAS A 2-DAY TRIP.

16:04.100 --> 16:05.367
NOW IT'S A JOURNEY.

16:05.367 --> 16:07.200
SOON IT WILL BE
A <i>VOYAGE. </i>

16:07.200 --> 16:08.867
I'M LOOKING
FOR SOMETHING, OK?

16:08.867 --> 16:10.400
I'M NOT GONNA BE ABLE
TO FIND IT AT HOME,

16:10.400 --> 16:12.500
AND I'M NOT GONNA
BE ABLE TO FIND IT
WITH YOU.

16:12.500 --> 16:13.934
THEN WHY AM I
ON THIS TRIP?

16:13.934 --> 16:15.300
WHY DID YOU BRING ME
IN THE FIRST PLACE?

16:15.300 --> 16:16.400
SO I COULD
GET YOUR BLESSING.

16:16.400 --> 16:18.000
'CAUSE I WANTED
TO SAY GOOD-BYE.

16:18.000 --> 16:19.567

YOU KNOW, I FEEL CHEAP.

NO. GIVE ME THE KEYS.
I AM TURNING
THIS TRAILER AROUND

16:27.767 --> 16:29.967
AND TAKING YOU HOME.
NO.

16:29.967 --> 16:31.200
YOU JUST WAIT
UNTIL FEENY HEARS
ABOUT THIS ONE.

16:31.200 --> 16:33.800
CORY, I NEED
YOUR HELP, OK?

16:33.800 --> 16:34.967
TELL ME EVERYTHING'S OK.

16:34.967 --> 16:36.400
TELL ME I'M MAKING
THE RIGHT DECISION.

16:36.400 --> 16:39.000
OK, FINE.
YOU WANT MY HELP?

16:39.000 --> 16:40.000
COME HERE.

16:40.000 --> 16:41.033
GO HOME,
FINISH COLLEGE,

16:41.033 --> 16:42.500

16:56.467 --> 16:57.667

16:57.667 --> 17:00.400
WE WANNA SEE
IF WE CAN MAKE IT

17:00.400 --> 17:01.767
SOMEWHERE
OTHER THAN HERE.

17:01.767 --> 17:04.300

NEVER LET THAT HAPPEN.

17:04.300 --> 17:06.000
IT DOESN'T MATTER.
I'M NOT LEAVING.

ARE ALL DAD HAS.

17:07.367 --> 17:10.100

THE REST OF OUR LIVES.

17:10.100 --> 17:12.233
LOOK, THIS IS
A BIG DECISION.

17:12.233 --> 17:14.600
COULD YOU TELL US
WHAT YOU REALLY THINK?

17:14.600 --> 17:16.767
NO. NO, I CAN'T,

17:16.767 --> 17:18.133
BECAUSE
I DON'T KNOW YOU.

17:18.133 --> 17:19.300
I DON'T WANT TO,

17:19.300 --> 17:20.300
I'M NOT GONNA.

17:20.300 --> 17:21.934
YOU CAN'T MAKE ME.

17:26.800 --> 17:30.834

THAN EVERY BAND
I'VE HEARD IN COLLEGE.

A REAL SHOT OUT THERE.

THINGS DON'T WORK OUT,

YOU'LL NEVER KNOW
WHAT YOUR LIVES
ARE GONNA BE LIKE

17:37.400 --> 17:40.500
IF YOU DON'T SEE
WHAT ELSE IS OUT THERE.

17:40.500 --> 17:43.133
SO TALK TO YOUR FATHER.
HE'LL UNDERSTAND.

17:43.133 --> 17:47.467
HE SEEMS LIKE
A VERY UNDERSTANDING GUY.

17:47.467 --> 17:49.467
AAH!

17:49.467 --> 17:51.367
WHY ARE YOU IN HERE
WITH MY DAUGHTERS?

17:51.367 --> 17:53.667
I'M NOT.

WE'RE GOOD, DAD.

TAKE A CHANCE
AND LEAVE.

MY GIRLS TO LEAVE ME?

COMES A TIME

18:08.667 --> 18:12.767
YOU DON'T WANT ME
TO TOUCH YOU,
DO YOU?

18:12.767 --> 18:14.867
WHY DON'T YOU KEEP DOING IT
AND SEE WHAT HAPPENS?

18:14.867 --> 18:16.967
I WAS JUST GONNA SAY,

18:16.967 --> 18:18.700
THERE COMES A TIME
IN EVERY MAN'S LIFE

FIND THEIR OWN WAY.

ABOUT THEM.

ABOUT THEM.

ABOUT ME.

TO GO HOME.

OUT THE DOOR.

GONNA BE OK WITHOUT US?

I MEAN, I DON'T KNOW
WHAT YOU'RE LOOKING FOR,

BUT I GUESS YOU NEED

19:34.233 --> 19:36.567
TO GO AWAY FOR A WHILE
TO FIND IT.

19:39.300 --> 19:41.300
YOU SURE, DADDY?

19:41.300 --> 19:43.200
WE'RE SURE, BILL?

19:43.200 --> 19:45.300
I'M AFRAID SO, KID.

19:46.667 --> 19:48.400
LISTEN, IF YOU
EVER NEED ANYTHING

19:48.400 --> 19:50.800
OR YOU EVER
NEED MY HELP--

19:50.800 --> 19:52.200
I KNOW.

19:54.767 --> 19:57.300
IT'S SO HARD
TO LET 'EM GO.

19:57.300 --> 19:59.934
YEAH.

20:05.100 --> 20:07.500
THANK YOU.

20:07.500 --> 20:10.667
TAKE CARE
OF YOURSELF, OK?

20:21.867 --> 20:24.934
YOU GONNA CRANK IT UP
OR WHAT?

20:24.934 --> 20:26.967
DAD?

20:26.967 --> 20:29.233
BET YOU DIDN'T
EXPECT TO SEE ME,

20:29.233 --> 20:30.767
DID YOU, SON?

20:30.767 --> 20:32.233
WHAT ARE YOU
DOING HERE?

20:34.200 --> 20:36.000
YOU'RE LOOKING
FOR SOMETHING.

20:36.000 --> 20:39.467
I THOUGHT I'D TRY
AND HELP YOU FIND IT.

20:39.467 --> 20:42.033
THAT'S VERY COOL
OF YOU.

20:42.033 --> 20:45.400
WELL, I WAS
ALWAYS A COOL GUY.

20:47.033 --> 20:49.300
I MISS YOU.

20:50.367 --> 20:52.667
I KNOW.

20:52.667 --> 20:54.200
BUT REMEMBER,

20:54.200 --> 20:58.367
