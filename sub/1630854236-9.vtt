<i>♪ Tryin' to erase you...♪</i>

00:25.689 --> 00:27.103
Nope. Little...

00:27.206 --> 00:29.689
Hey, handsome,
can I get you a refill?

00:29.793 --> 00:31.310
No. Thank you.

00:31.413 --> 00:33.551
You sure? It's on the house.
Extra whipped cream.

00:33.655 --> 00:36.448
I appreciate it,
but I'm good.

<i>♪ Chasin' the truth,

00:38.793 --> 00:39.896
Dude, seriously?

00:40.000 --> 00:41.137
She's lucky I'm not
your girlfriend.

00:41.241 --> 00:42.586
She was hard-core
flirting with you.

00:42.689 --> 00:44.103
No, she was not.

00:44.793 --> 00:46.586
That was just
really good service.

00:46.689 --> 00:49.586
Okay, then I'm just gonna go
around calling people handsome,

00:49.689 --> 00:51.724
even if I have
no romantic interest in them.

00:51.827 --> 00:54.551
- Fine, go ahead.
- Sounds good, handsome.

00:54.655 --> 00:56.724
All right, calm down,
all right?

00:56.827 --> 00:59.310
Man, it's hard enough
just trying to hold down

00:59.413 --> 01:00.965
- this job as it is.
- Come on,

01:01.068 --> 01:02.172
you don't think Captain James

01:02.275 --> 01:03.689
is that upset with you, do you?

01:03.793 --> 01:05.206
Yeah.

01:05.310 --> 01:06.448
But no one fought

01:06.551 --> 01:07.896
harder than he did
to get you here.

01:08.000 --> 01:09.517
The mayor chose you

01:09.620 --> 01:12.103
to be his personal bodyguard,
for God's sakes.

01:12.206 --> 01:14.827
Actually,
that reminds me,

01:14.931 --> 01:16.137
did Kevin tell you

01:16.241 --> 01:17.551
about our lunch
with the mayor tomorrow?

01:17.655 --> 01:18.689
What?

01:18.793 --> 01:20.137
He didn't tell you?

01:20.241 --> 01:23.206
The mayor's honoring us
in a couple of weeks

01:23.310 --> 01:24.827
for bravery.

01:24.931 --> 01:26.275
Walker and Liam, too.

01:26.379 --> 01:27.965
- Honored?
- Yeah.

01:28.068 --> 01:29.586
- Do we get medals?
- I don't know.

01:29.689 --> 01:32.482
I'm surprised that Kev
didn't tell you.

01:32.586 --> 01:34.172
Well, I'm not.

01:34.275 --> 01:37.068
We have very strict work/life

01:37.172 --> 01:39.379
- balance rules, yes.
- Ooh, do tell.

01:39.482 --> 01:42.758
No texting during work,
no shoptalk when we hang out,

01:42.862 --> 01:44.172
no adjusting the rules

01:44.275 --> 01:45.758
without consulting a proctor--
that's you.

01:45.862 --> 01:48.482
What-- That's me?
Did-did I consent to that?

01:49.931 --> 01:51.206
I just don't want another fling,

01:51.310 --> 01:53.551
you know, and he seems like

01:53.655 --> 01:56.517
this perfect guy,
and everyone keeps telling me

01:56.620 --> 01:58.586
we should make it
something serious.

01:58.689 --> 01:59.793
Yeah, I get it.

01:59.896 --> 02:01.379
But don't you think that
tomorrow's lunch

02:01.482 --> 02:02.620
might complicate things?

02:02.724 --> 02:05.275
It will be fine.
I will act professional.

02:05.379 --> 02:06.862
And, thankfully,

02:06.965 --> 02:08.379
with the state that you're in,

02:08.482 --> 02:09.620
you'll suck any romance
out of the room anyway.

02:11.413 --> 02:14.172
Oh, thank you.

02:21.620 --> 02:22.827
Oh, it's Walker.

02:22.931 --> 02:25.034
Possible 10-33 down
at the server farm

02:25.137 --> 02:26.482
on the corner of
Copperfield and Windsor.

02:26.586 --> 02:28.241
- That's a government building.
- Yeah.

02:28.344 --> 02:30.517
- Probably won't take long
to go check it out.
- You coming?

02:30.620 --> 02:33.551
I cannot. Desk duty calls.

02:33.655 --> 02:35.344
Ah.

02:37.413 --> 02:40.310
What? I thought you had this.

02:42.448 --> 02:44.655
Check...

02:45.793 --> 02:46.793
...mate.

02:46.896 --> 02:48.482
That is not fair.

02:48.586 --> 02:49.931
I don't have a real queen,

02:50.034 --> 02:52.241
so I can't properly
visualize this game.

02:52.344 --> 02:54.482
I'm sorry,
but we lost it in the move.

02:55.586 --> 02:56.655
If it makes you feel better,

02:56.758 --> 02:58.034
we can switch sides,

02:58.137 --> 02:59.344
and I can beat you again.

02:59.448 --> 03:00.620
You know, I have left

03:00.724 --> 03:02.275
four messages
down at that feed store,

03:02.379 --> 03:03.551
heard back nothing,

03:03.655 --> 03:05.137
and our delivery
hasn't come this week.

03:05.241 --> 03:07.689
How in the hell am I supposed
to feed our horses?

03:07.793 --> 03:10.000
Plus the extra dozen
that are over at the Davidsons.

03:10.103 --> 03:12.275
You know, I need to go down
to that damn feed store

03:12.379 --> 03:13.551
and give them
a piece of my mind.

03:13.655 --> 03:14.724
No, wait, Dad,

03:14.827 --> 03:15.965
stay.

03:16.068 --> 03:18.482
Uh, let Mom smoke you at chess.

03:18.586 --> 03:20.103
I will go down
to that feed store.

03:20.206 --> 03:21.586
I will handle everything.

03:21.689 --> 03:23.068
- Yeah, but I...
- No, no, no, seriously,

03:23.172 --> 03:24.482
I do need to step up
around here,

03:24.586 --> 03:26.793
especially with
Mom's recovery, and

03:26.896 --> 03:28.344
don't you think
I should know the vendors

03:28.448 --> 03:29.896
that we work with? I mean,

03:30.000 --> 03:31.517
somebody's got to take over
this place eventually.

03:33.137 --> 03:36.206
Fine, but just know, this is
not one of your courtroom cases.

03:36.310 --> 03:37.827
I had a hell of a time securing

03:37.931 --> 03:39.896
a feed deal after pulling
our business out of Morrison's.

03:40.000 --> 03:43.034
So, you just get in and get out.

03:43.137 --> 03:45.241
Last thing I need is more drama.

03:48.310 --> 03:49.965
Hey.

03:50.068 --> 03:51.103
Hey, hon.

03:51.206 --> 03:52.172
Hey.

03:52.275 --> 03:53.275
There's, uh, banana bread

03:53.379 --> 03:54.620
on the stove if you want some.

03:54.724 --> 03:57.379
Oh, uh, no. No, thank you.
I just, uh,

03:57.482 --> 03:59.482
finished mucking the stalls, um,

03:59.586 --> 04:01.896
brushed the horses,
and I, uh, watered the garden

04:02.000 --> 04:02.931
for you.

04:03.034 --> 04:04.758
You expecting a prize?

04:04.862 --> 04:08.172
No, no, I just... I-I came here
to see what else I can do.

04:08.275 --> 04:10.793
Maybe I can help out Uncle Liam?

04:10.896 --> 04:13.413
Oh, you could find
our missing queen.

04:13.517 --> 04:15.655
I think you've done enough
around here. Tomorrow

04:15.758 --> 04:17.172
you can go down
to The Side Step,

04:17.275 --> 04:18.689
pick up an extra shift,

04:18.793 --> 04:21.000
make up for all that liquor
you stole at your party.

04:22.137 --> 04:24.241
Okay. Yeah.

04:24.344 --> 04:25.517
I got it.

04:25.620 --> 04:26.931
I'll do that, Gramps.

04:27.034 --> 04:28.275
Uh-huh.

04:29.655 --> 04:32.000
Okay, you have got

04:32.103 --> 04:33.586
to forgive him at some point.

04:33.689 --> 04:35.241
And don't pretend that

04:35.344 --> 04:37.482
you weren't once
a-a reckless teenager.

04:37.586 --> 04:39.310
Allegedly. And the Corps
straightened me out on that.

04:39.413 --> 04:41.103
That boy's undisciplined.

04:41.206 --> 04:44.413
He's causing too much stress
around here, don't you think?

04:44.517 --> 04:47.620
Well, there's not much
we can do about it.

04:56.310 --> 04:59.344
- No signs of a forced entry.
- No.

05:00.137 --> 05:02.034
Hello?

05:02.137 --> 05:03.931
Anybody work here?

05:04.034 --> 05:07.137
Perp must have tripped the alarm
that alerted the police.

05:09.103 --> 05:11.344
Hey.

05:19.448 --> 05:21.896
Cassie.

05:43.034 --> 05:44.034
Go back to the terminal.

05:44.758 --> 05:46.827
Wait. Do you hear that?

05:46.931 --> 05:48.034
Yeah.

05:51.379 --> 05:53.586
Go.

06:02.034 --> 06:03.724
Hey! Texas Rangers!

06:09.689 --> 06:11.655
We know you're in here.

06:11.758 --> 06:14.310
Give up your position now.

Hey, take care.

07:31.379 --> 07:32.517
Hey, you're Jim,

07:32.620 --> 07:34.137
- right? The manager here?
- Yup, yup.

07:34.241 --> 07:36.000
I'm Bonham Walker's son.

07:36.103 --> 07:37.241
The Texas Ranger?

07:37.344 --> 07:39.379
Liam, the other one.

07:39.482 --> 07:42.862
Yeah, I-I think I saw you make
a speech when you ran for D.A.

07:42.965 --> 07:45.586
- Hmm.
- I'm...

07:45.689 --> 07:46.620
sorry for your loss there.

07:46.724 --> 07:48.551
Ah, well, thanks.

07:48.655 --> 07:50.758
Ranching's more my speed now.

07:50.862 --> 07:52.344
And since we're new
to your business, I was hoping

07:52.448 --> 07:54.413
we could smooth some things out.
I, uh,

07:54.517 --> 07:56.379
did some research
on behalf of my dad,

07:56.482 --> 07:59.896
and our feed deliveries
are late to our ranch here,

08:00.000 --> 08:02.586
here-- Actually, four times
just this quarter,

08:02.689 --> 08:04.068
and I'm sure that it's

08:04.172 --> 08:06.137
a timing issue, but then
I dug a little bit deeper,

08:06.241 --> 08:07.896
and I cross-referenced
your prices

08:08.000 --> 08:11.517
with the mean value
of this feed brand statewide,

08:11.620 --> 08:14.034
and you've been overcharging us.

08:15.068 --> 08:17.827
What are you gonna do
to fix this?

08:19.206 --> 08:21.137
This research
is from a week ago.

08:21.241 --> 08:23.793
Travis County has
inflated prices since then.

08:23.896 --> 08:25.965
A real rancher would know that.

08:26.068 --> 08:27.689
And if you'd
just bothered to ask,

08:27.793 --> 08:28.896
I could've told you
we raised prices

08:29.000 --> 08:31.103
on everyone buying that feed,

08:31.206 --> 08:32.620
except for your dad.

08:32.724 --> 08:34.137
Thought it was only fair,
given the

08:34.241 --> 08:36.896
circumstances of his change
over to the store, so...

08:37.000 --> 08:39.448
Oh, well, in that case, Jim,

08:39.551 --> 08:42.068
- I...
- Thanks for coming in, Liam,

08:42.172 --> 08:43.827
but if you're the one
taking over for your father,

08:43.931 --> 08:45.965
maybe we just
sever ties right here.

08:46.068 --> 08:47.413
Go find yourself

08:47.517 --> 08:49.551
a feed store that can handle
your big vocabulary.

08:49.655 --> 08:52.827
Have a nice day.

08:52.931 --> 08:54.793
Hello there.
How can I help you?

09:02.551 --> 09:04.137
Hey.

09:05.517 --> 09:07.310
So, any update on your perp?

09:07.413 --> 09:08.862
Uh, yeah.

09:08.965 --> 09:11.379
The manager of the
server farm was able to speak

09:11.482 --> 09:12.896
to the hostage. She said she was

09:13.000 --> 09:14.758
at the front desk
when he came in,

09:14.862 --> 09:16.620
and he tried
to freeze the server

09:16.724 --> 09:18.586
and tried to launch some kind of

09:18.689 --> 09:20.827
unsuccessful ransomware attack.

09:20.931 --> 09:23.000
If that's true,
that's domestic terrorism.

09:23.103 --> 09:24.482
He'd be going away
for a long time.

09:24.586 --> 09:25.965
Yeah, but it's just
weird, though,

09:26.068 --> 09:27.896
because I've been doing
all this research on him,

09:28.000 --> 09:29.310
and he just seems like this

09:29.413 --> 09:31.931
do-gooder in the city.

09:32.034 --> 09:34.551
Hosting all these rallies,

09:34.655 --> 09:37.482
advocating for income equality.

09:37.586 --> 09:39.482
Just another Victor Ziff

09:39.586 --> 09:42.172
hacker philanthropist wannabe.

09:42.275 --> 09:43.896
The most unhinged people

09:44.000 --> 09:45.655
are usually the best
at playing human.

09:45.758 --> 09:46.965
But what would he have to gain

09:47.068 --> 09:48.517
from breaking into
this server farm?

09:48.620 --> 09:49.931
Well, he's in custody now,

09:50.034 --> 09:52.172
so I'm assuming that
you're gonna find out

09:52.275 --> 09:53.724
soon enough.

09:53.827 --> 09:57.310
Hey, you want to carpool
to lunch today, handsome?

09:58.862 --> 10:01.172
I've been thinking about it.
I shouldn't go.

10:01.275 --> 10:04.172
I got to stay here and log in
the camera footage evidence

10:04.275 --> 10:05.413
from the server farm.

10:06.931 --> 10:08.517
Mayor's probably not
even gonna show anyways.

10:08.620 --> 10:09.931
It's all good.

10:10.034 --> 10:12.448
No, no, no, no, no.
It is not all good.

10:12.551 --> 10:13.862
It kills me

10:13.965 --> 10:15.896
that you are still on desk duty

10:16.000 --> 10:18.517
for something
that was my mistake, too.

10:18.620 --> 10:20.379
Let me talk to Captain James
for you.

10:20.482 --> 10:22.724
No. Mm-mm. That's okay.

10:22.827 --> 10:25.137
All right?
Besides, he's out of town.

10:25.241 --> 10:27.482
I just got to buckle down
and finish these

10:27.586 --> 10:28.793
last few shifts.

10:28.896 --> 10:31.000
Cass, I have a lot
riding on this.

10:32.379 --> 10:34.379
I have to prove to James that

10:34.482 --> 10:36.206
hiring me wasn't a mistake.

10:36.310 --> 10:39.827
Hiring you was one of the
best decisions he has made

10:39.931 --> 10:41.517
for this department.

10:41.620 --> 10:43.931
After me, obviously.

10:44.034 --> 10:46.206
Yeah,
that goes without saying.

10:47.586 --> 10:49.000
You'll be back
in the field in no time.

10:49.103 --> 10:50.724
Thank you.

10:50.827 --> 10:53.517
All right,
I'll see you in a bit, handsome.

10:56.586 --> 10:58.965
You know, I could really use

10:59.068 --> 11:01.758
a stiff drink right about now.

11:01.862 --> 11:05.793
Our liquor license
continues to be nonexistent.

11:05.896 --> 11:07.689
Now, that fancy

11:07.793 --> 11:09.724
lunch place
you're going to with Dad,

11:09.827 --> 11:12.034
- that could be promising.
- I am not going.

11:12.137 --> 11:14.620
I'm not in the headspace
to revisit any of that stuff,

11:14.724 --> 11:17.931
especially not after messing up
so bad this morning.

11:18.034 --> 11:19.586
You had good intentions.

11:19.689 --> 11:21.034
LIAM [sighs]:
I just feel
like every single time

11:21.137 --> 11:22.517
I try and do the right thing,

11:22.620 --> 11:24.103
it ends up biting me in the ass.

11:24.206 --> 11:27.379
I just want to feel in control
of something.

11:27.482 --> 11:30.275
You are not alone, trust me.

11:33.000 --> 11:34.448
How did we get here?

11:34.551 --> 11:36.379
It feels like just last week

11:36.482 --> 11:37.655
I was ready

11:37.758 --> 11:40.034
to adopt you and Augie,
and now...

11:41.241 --> 11:43.965
...I can't be trusted
to buy a bag of feed.

11:44.068 --> 11:46.896
Look, you have always taken care
of Augie and me,

11:47.000 --> 11:48.586
and I just want
to do the same for you.

11:48.689 --> 11:49.758
So,

11:49.862 --> 11:51.482
let's take a step back

11:51.586 --> 11:52.758
and think about the big picture.

11:52.862 --> 11:54.137
Feed aside,

11:54.241 --> 11:55.758
what are we actually
doing with these horses?

11:55.862 --> 11:57.896
I don't know. Do you know?
I don't know.

11:58.000 --> 11:59.551
It's been hard to build it
into what I imagined

11:59.655 --> 12:02.413
because Gramps wants to keep
everything very small,

12:02.517 --> 12:04.413
especially with
Mawline's recovery,

12:04.517 --> 12:05.724
so...

12:05.827 --> 12:07.896
What if we grow it?

12:08.000 --> 12:09.862
On our own,
make it more official.

12:09.965 --> 12:12.793
What, like, making it
into a 501[c]?

12:12.896 --> 12:14.241
A 5-0-what?

12:14.344 --> 12:16.724
A 501[c], it's like
making it into a charity.

12:18.517 --> 12:20.206
But you know what, actually,

12:20.310 --> 12:23.724
with that status, we'd be able
to build a horse rescue

12:23.827 --> 12:25.620
and rehabilitation center.

12:25.724 --> 12:27.517
We could help horses and people.

12:27.620 --> 12:29.482
Tacos.

12:29.586 --> 12:31.965
Hey, wait, stay. We're talking
about the horse rescue.

12:32.068 --> 12:33.931
I am running this place
by myself.

12:34.034 --> 12:35.275
What are you talking about?
Augie is here.

12:35.379 --> 12:37.172
Again, running this place
by myself,

12:37.275 --> 12:39.206
and I've been meaning
to tell you guys,

12:39.310 --> 12:41.517
I don't know if I can be a part
of the horse rescue stuff.

12:42.620 --> 12:44.448
Just feels like
bad karma from my grandma,

12:44.551 --> 12:47.034
and this crazy idea
that she didn't even mean.

12:47.137 --> 12:49.344
And we're just as unqualified
to start it as she was,

12:49.448 --> 12:50.413
so...

12:50.517 --> 12:51.758
It's a whole thing.

12:51.862 --> 12:53.068
Whoa.

12:53.172 --> 12:54.344
Okay.

12:54.448 --> 12:57.137
That's a lot
you've been sitting on.

12:57.241 --> 12:59.724
Why are you bringing
your grandma into this?

12:59.827 --> 13:01.793
The horse rescue
was our thing first.

13:01.896 --> 13:03.413
Stella, I...

13:03.517 --> 13:06.103
- Is there something else
on your mind?
- I'm fine.

13:06.206 --> 13:08.724
I-I just, I got to go, okay?

13:14.137 --> 13:15.862
- Thank you, sir.
- Thank you.

13:15.965 --> 13:17.896
Okay, handsome.

13:18.000 --> 13:19.379
Excuse me?

13:19.482 --> 13:21.793
Don't worry about it.
You had to be there.

13:21.896 --> 13:22.896
- All right.
- Okay.

13:23.000 --> 13:25.793
So, should I shake Kevin's hand

13:25.896 --> 13:26.931
when I see him?
Or maybe a little

13:27.034 --> 13:28.896
side hug? Maybe a little wave?

13:29.000 --> 13:32.068
I think, uh, handshakes
are always neutral.

13:32.172 --> 13:34.241
- Try that.
- Should it be firm, though?

13:34.344 --> 13:37.275
'Cause I feel like if it's too
much, then he'll think that I'm

13:37.379 --> 13:39.413
trying too hard, but if it's
loose, then he'll think

13:39.517 --> 13:41.206
that I'm weak,
and, let's be honest,

13:41.310 --> 13:42.724
I could definitely beat him
in hand-to-hand combat.

13:42.827 --> 13:45.896
- Do you think we get medals?
- Cass, hey, hey, shh.

13:46.000 --> 13:47.931
Take a breath, all right?
It's gonna be okay.

13:48.034 --> 13:49.965
Seems like a great guy,
just maybe

13:50.068 --> 13:51.379
dive into the deep end.

13:51.482 --> 13:53.206
Wow, says the guy
who threw in the towel.

13:53.310 --> 13:55.344
I didn't throw in
the towel.

13:55.448 --> 13:57.241
Yeah? When was the last time
you spoke to Geri?

13:57.344 --> 14:00.862
Okay, she said
she needed some space

14:00.965 --> 14:03.275
to deal with family stuff, and
I'm respecting that decision.

14:03.379 --> 14:05.448
You know what? I'm not gonna
let you make this about me.

14:05.551 --> 14:06.482
We got work to do.

14:09.000 --> 14:11.551
But, seriously, can you ask
about the medals?

14:11.655 --> 14:13.103
Thank you.

14:16.310 --> 14:18.448
Okay, thank you for checking.

14:18.551 --> 14:19.827
Julia?

14:21.517 --> 14:23.206
Julia.

14:23.310 --> 14:24.344
Hey.

14:24.448 --> 14:25.896
- Hey.
- Hi.
- Uh,

14:26.000 --> 14:28.448
- Ranger Perez?
- Yes.

14:28.551 --> 14:29.724
Right? It's been a while.

14:29.827 --> 14:31.275
- Julia Johnson.
- The reporter.

14:31.379 --> 14:33.620
- Yeah.
- It's nice to see you again

14:33.724 --> 14:35.000
under better circumstances.

14:35.103 --> 14:36.310
Well, what are you,
what are you doing here?

14:36.413 --> 14:37.793
The mayor's chief of staff
invited me.

14:37.896 --> 14:39.896
I guess we're
being honored, huh?

14:40.000 --> 14:41.482
There they are.

14:41.586 --> 14:43.724
My three heroes. Come on in.
We're ready for you. Hi.

14:43.827 --> 14:44.896
- Hi.
- How are you?

14:45.000 --> 14:46.034
- Good to see you.
- Good to see you.

14:46.137 --> 14:48.034
- Yeah.
- Thanks for coming.

14:49.793 --> 14:51.034
You okay?

14:51.965 --> 14:52.965
Yeah. Yeah, I'm fine.

14:53.068 --> 14:54.793
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

14:54.896 --> 14:57.482
Just... I haven't seen her

14:57.586 --> 14:59.310
since she reached out
for the article.

14:59.413 --> 15:00.862
A while.

15:00.965 --> 15:03.551
Yeah. Hey, was your handshake
weirdly soft at first

15:03.655 --> 15:05.689
and then got really firm
out of nowhere?

15:05.793 --> 15:07.103
- Walker.
- Yeah?

15:07.206 --> 15:08.862
You're reading
way too much into this. Come on.

15:08.965 --> 15:11.620
Yeah, yeah.

15:12.655 --> 15:14.689
Uh, the mayor does send
his apologies,

15:14.793 --> 15:16.000
by the way. He couldn't make it.

15:16.103 --> 15:17.793
However, I am very happy
to have you here.

15:17.896 --> 15:20.862
- Yeah.
- Especially given your
hospitality at Thanksgiving.

15:20.965 --> 15:23.655
Full disclosure, that's not
usually how our holidays go.

15:23.758 --> 15:25.103
Every family has their fights.

15:25.206 --> 15:26.827
- Really, it was
a lovely evening.
- Yeah.

15:26.931 --> 15:29.862
It's very nice to see you,
Ranger Perez.

15:29.965 --> 15:31.482
Kevin.

15:31.586 --> 15:33.448
That's right.
Please have a seat.

15:33.551 --> 15:35.344
You can set your hats here,
if you'd like.

15:35.448 --> 15:36.586
Oh, thank you.

15:36.689 --> 15:37.931
- Uh...
- Uh, oh...

15:38.034 --> 15:40.172
All right.

15:40.275 --> 15:41.620
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

15:44.586 --> 15:45.965
So, uh, Julia,

15:46.068 --> 15:47.517
h-how's-how's work?

15:47.620 --> 15:48.827
It's good. Thanks.

15:48.931 --> 15:50.034
Good. Yeah.

15:50.137 --> 15:52.068
And, uh, family,
how's your family?

15:52.172 --> 15:54.068
Actually, I don't really
talk to them that much.

15:54.172 --> 15:56.379
Okay, uh...

15:56.482 --> 15:59.586
Kevin, I did not think it was
possible, but you have

15:59.689 --> 16:01.551
outdone the Heatherly
senate luncheon.

16:01.655 --> 16:04.379
You two know each other?

16:04.482 --> 16:06.068
Yes. Kevin's helped me get

16:06.172 --> 16:07.586
some pretty exclusive interviews.

16:07.689 --> 16:10.034
Yes, and we are press event
buddies, as it were.

16:10.137 --> 16:11.344
Which basically means

16:11.448 --> 16:13.793
that we stand in a corner
and talk about

16:13.896 --> 16:15.413
who's having an affair with who.

16:15.517 --> 16:16.965
- By the way, I have an update
for you on that.
- Please.

16:19.275 --> 16:20.655
And you two know each other

16:20.758 --> 16:22.103
from the recent security threat
on the mayor.

16:22.206 --> 16:25.517
- Yes. We've collaborated.
- Hmm.

16:25.620 --> 16:27.344
We're still working out
the logistics.

16:28.482 --> 16:29.655
Yes, uh,

16:29.758 --> 16:31.862
either way, we should get
down to business.

16:31.965 --> 16:34.103
- Mm-hmm.
- Now, as you know,
the mayor would like

16:34.206 --> 16:35.862
to honor all of you
in a couple weeks.

16:35.965 --> 16:37.724
Exciting, yes?

16:42.482 --> 16:46.000
Um, are we going to be
receiving medals?

16:47.482 --> 16:50.103
The mayor wants to give you
much more than that.

16:50.206 --> 16:52.758
He's very impressed
by your resilience

16:52.862 --> 16:54.241
and bravery over the last year,

16:54.344 --> 16:57.172
especially you,
with your article. And you...

16:58.034 --> 16:59.275
Well, you saved my life.

16:59.379 --> 17:01.310
And thank you does not
begin to be enough,

17:01.413 --> 17:03.379
but I hope this is a start.

17:03.482 --> 17:05.379
So, I brought you here because

17:05.482 --> 17:06.896
I want to ask you
a couple questions.

17:07.000 --> 17:08.482
You know, to help formulate
the mayor's speech.

17:08.586 --> 17:10.655
With your permission, of course.

17:10.758 --> 17:13.206
This part can get
a little dicey sometimes.

17:13.310 --> 17:14.655
- Yes?
- Oh, yeah.

17:14.758 --> 17:16.689
- It's a yes?
- Yes, of course.
- Yes, of course.

17:16.793 --> 17:17.965
Great. Uh...

17:18.068 --> 17:19.758
Let's start in the summer,

17:19.862 --> 17:21.965
with a few questions
about your experience

17:22.068 --> 17:23.551
in captivity.

17:36.724 --> 17:40.137
Bro, I've barely made
$20 in tips

17:40.241 --> 17:41.551
- all day.
- Mm.

17:41.655 --> 17:44.379
No, dude, that's
for paying customers.

17:44.482 --> 17:46.586
There's a box of saltines
in the back

17:46.689 --> 17:48.931
next to the rat poison
if you're hungry.

17:49.034 --> 17:52.379
Okay, you're mad at me.

17:53.655 --> 17:56.137
Grab me the cumin?

17:56.241 --> 17:59.448
Look, dude, I get it.
All right, I hurt Stella.

17:59.551 --> 18:03.241
You have every right
to hold a grudge.

18:03.344 --> 18:05.862
What about your grandparents?

18:05.965 --> 18:08.206
They still not talking to you
after what you did?

18:08.310 --> 18:09.931
Well, Mawline has forgiven me,

18:10.034 --> 18:12.724
but I can't help but blame
myself for the TIA.

18:12.827 --> 18:15.000
And Gramps is, uh...

18:15.103 --> 18:17.586
not gonna forgive me
for a long time.

18:19.068 --> 18:20.896
You know,
it's kind of funny, um,

18:21.000 --> 18:22.758
I'm actually going through
something similar

18:22.862 --> 18:26.068
with my grandma,
except I'm on the other side.

18:28.206 --> 18:30.172
She sent me a letter.

18:31.517 --> 18:34.068
I haven't told Stella yet,
but she wants me to go visit.

18:35.000 --> 18:37.689
I-I can barely bring myself
to look at the letter,

18:37.793 --> 18:39.793
let alone think about
looking at her in the eye.

18:39.896 --> 18:41.931
My parents are in Thalia,

18:42.034 --> 18:44.689
and going back there feels
like going backwards.

18:46.034 --> 18:48.482
And just how everything
went down

18:48.586 --> 18:50.172
with my grandma,
how sudden it all was,

18:50.275 --> 18:53.793
how weird it is
to talk to my mom about it,

18:53.896 --> 18:56.482
everything...

18:56.586 --> 18:58.827
Almost feels like she died.

18:58.931 --> 19:00.206
I get it, bro.

19:00.310 --> 19:03.448
You're valid, but also

19:03.551 --> 19:05.034
I feel like your grandma

19:05.137 --> 19:08.034
might not expect for you
to forgive her in-in one night.

19:08.137 --> 19:11.034
So maybe just write her back

19:11.137 --> 19:14.379
and build up to a visit.

19:15.655 --> 19:18.344
Yeah. I guess I could do that.

19:19.517 --> 19:20.551
You know, Colton, you deserve

19:20.655 --> 19:22.068
the-the family you're craving.

19:22.172 --> 19:24.448
And, to be honest,

19:24.551 --> 19:27.068
you're like the closest thing
to a brother that I-I...

19:27.172 --> 19:28.413
I have.

19:28.517 --> 19:31.310
- Truly.
- Same.

19:32.862 --> 19:34.620
Which is why I should say
you're never

19:34.724 --> 19:37.413
gonna repay your debt
when business is this slow.

19:37.517 --> 19:39.827
Especially with that top shelf
stuff you stole.

19:41.206 --> 19:43.310
So, take off your apron

19:43.413 --> 19:44.620
and go think about something
that would actually

19:44.724 --> 19:47.620
have some meaning
for your grandparents.

19:47.724 --> 19:49.275
Money aside.

19:50.827 --> 19:52.724
I'm sorry, I have to ask.

19:52.827 --> 19:54.241
Really, I-I-I am, but

19:54.344 --> 19:56.000
the mayor needs to be prepped
for any and all questions

19:56.103 --> 19:58.241
that might come his way
during the event, and,

19:58.344 --> 20:00.620
unfortunately, the more
uncomfortable it is now,

20:00.724 --> 20:02.482
the smoother it'll be
on the day of.

20:02.586 --> 20:04.310
Of course. Sure. Um...

20:06.551 --> 20:07.931
What would you like to know?

20:08.034 --> 20:10.931
Don't answer anything
you don't want to, but,

20:11.034 --> 20:12.896
if you're comfortable,

20:13.000 --> 20:14.482
we'd like to know
a little bit more about

20:14.586 --> 20:16.034
this anarchist group
behind the abductions.

20:17.620 --> 20:19.758
- Do you have any more leads?
- Um...

20:20.620 --> 20:23.620
We don't know anything
you don't.

20:23.724 --> 20:25.517
Noted.

20:25.620 --> 20:27.172
- Thank you.
- Sure.

20:27.275 --> 20:29.206
Let's move on
to after the takedown.

20:29.310 --> 20:31.034
Perhaps talk a little bit
about your article.

20:31.137 --> 20:33.068
Is there a specific question?

20:33.172 --> 20:35.517
Oh, what was the reception,
you know, when you published it?

20:35.620 --> 20:37.172
Did anybody reach out?

20:38.379 --> 20:41.724
Julia's article was very

20:41.827 --> 20:44.551
well received.
She's an incredible writer.

20:44.655 --> 20:46.793
I've been reading her stuff
since, uh, since we met.

20:46.896 --> 20:48.586
It's okay. I got it.

20:48.689 --> 20:49.517
Okay. Yeah.

20:49.620 --> 20:51.034
The article was fine.

20:51.137 --> 20:52.862
My editor liked it,

20:52.965 --> 20:55.379
and it was what it was.

21:00.413 --> 21:02.931
Maybe we should shift
over to, um...

21:03.034 --> 21:05.275
Maybe we should stop
with the questions for now.

21:11.103 --> 21:12.482
Well...

21:12.586 --> 21:14.517
this is not the way
things usually go.

21:15.482 --> 21:16.724
If any of you have
the sudden urge

21:16.827 --> 21:18.655
to stab me,
I believe the steak course

21:18.758 --> 21:20.068
should be coming any second.

21:20.172 --> 21:21.827
I will be right back.

21:21.931 --> 21:23.172
I just need some air.

21:23.275 --> 21:25.862
Excuse me.

21:27.344 --> 21:29.862
I'm sorry,
I need a sec, please.

21:29.965 --> 21:31.827
I'll be right back.

22:09.275 --> 22:10.241
Can I help you?

22:10.344 --> 22:11.896
Sorry.

22:12.000 --> 22:15.413
I couldn't help but notice
you watched the same clip, like,

22:15.517 --> 22:17.068
seven times.

22:17.172 --> 22:19.448
The guy with the knife
helps her when she slips.

22:19.551 --> 22:22.000
- Right?
- You saw it, too.

22:22.103 --> 22:23.241
Yeah. It's weird.

22:23.344 --> 22:26.241
It is weird. Thank you.

22:26.344 --> 22:28.034
Mm-hmm.

22:33.482 --> 22:34.965
Hey, whoa.

22:35.068 --> 22:37.034
There was a perp here
that was arrested yesterday.

22:37.137 --> 22:38.344
David Brothy.

22:38.448 --> 22:39.413
I wanted to ask him
some questions.

22:39.517 --> 22:40.413
- Hacker guy?
- Yeah.

22:40.517 --> 22:41.482
He left an hour ago.

22:41.586 --> 22:42.482
He was brought in on charges

22:42.586 --> 22:44.034
of domestic terrorism.

22:44.137 --> 22:45.965
There's no way he was released
on bail this quick.

22:46.068 --> 22:49.206
I thought it was strange, too,
but papers came in this morning.

22:49.310 --> 22:50.724
Sorry, Trey, he's gone.

23:09.275 --> 23:11.206
Hey.

23:11.310 --> 23:13.724
Hey, I-I know you came out here
to have a breather,

23:13.827 --> 23:16.275
and the second you tell me
to leave, I'm gone,

23:16.379 --> 23:20.413
but I-I have to ask you,
did-did I do something wrong?

23:20.517 --> 23:22.862
No, no, it's fine.

23:22.965 --> 23:25.000
You sure?
Because the last thing

23:25.103 --> 23:27.000
I would ever want to do
is offend you.

23:27.103 --> 23:30.172
No, I'm, um...

23:30.275 --> 23:32.655
I'm just surprised to see you

23:32.758 --> 23:34.482
and to hear that you read it.

23:34.586 --> 23:37.379
Read-read what?

23:37.482 --> 23:39.000
My article.

23:40.275 --> 23:42.517
Maybe this was a mistake.

23:43.344 --> 23:46.689
Look, I guess Walker and Julia
haven't seen each other since...

23:46.793 --> 23:49.000
No, no, no, not that.

23:49.103 --> 23:51.000
I meant us.

23:51.103 --> 23:54.448
Thinking we could separate work
and life so easily.

23:54.551 --> 23:57.482
- Uh, Kevin...
- I know I can be intense.

23:57.586 --> 23:59.275
I know that, but...

23:59.379 --> 24:02.896
I don't know, I can't help but
wonder that maybe you created

24:03.000 --> 24:07.000
these rules because you're
embarrassed of me.

24:07.103 --> 24:08.551
What?

24:08.655 --> 24:10.413
No, no, no, no, no.

24:10.517 --> 24:11.896
I have been interested

24:12.000 --> 24:14.172
in so many men
way more embarrassing than you.

24:15.344 --> 24:17.310
Oh, my God, that came out wrong.

24:17.413 --> 24:18.379
Did it?

24:18.482 --> 24:20.137
Yes, yes, it did.

24:21.241 --> 24:22.896
And maybe you're right.

24:23.000 --> 24:26.655
All these rules are just making
things more complicated.

24:26.758 --> 24:27.724
<i>After it was published,</i>

24:27.827 --> 24:29.586
I wanted to call and check in.

24:29.689 --> 24:30.724
Why didn't you?

24:30.827 --> 24:31.827
Because

24:31.931 --> 24:33.620
we didn't exactly meet at a bar.

24:33.724 --> 24:34.724
Right.

24:34.827 --> 24:35.793
I didn't know how you'd feel

24:35.896 --> 24:37.310
hearing from me, you know,

24:37.413 --> 24:39.448
if I'd make you backtrack.

24:39.551 --> 24:41.827
In the back of my mind I thought

24:41.931 --> 24:44.344
that you might reach out
after reading it,

24:44.448 --> 24:45.724
and when you didn't,

24:45.827 --> 24:47.862
I assumed it was for a reason,

24:47.965 --> 24:49.862
and I get it.

24:49.965 --> 24:52.758
Uh, we symbolize pain
to each other.

24:52.862 --> 24:54.103
I didn't want to hurt you more.

24:54.206 --> 24:57.413
No, I-I...

24:57.517 --> 24:59.724
I'm sorry, I-I'm so sorry.

24:59.827 --> 25:01.275
No, you don't need to be.

25:01.379 --> 25:03.000
You're not a mind reader.

25:04.275 --> 25:06.482
But you asked,
and that's the answer.

25:07.827 --> 25:09.862
- I do like you, Kevin.
- Cassie, you really don't have

25:09.965 --> 25:13.241
- to do that.
- No, I do, really.

25:14.068 --> 25:18.482
So maybe texting during work
won't destroy us.

25:19.724 --> 25:22.137
Plus I have seriously
been missing out

25:22.241 --> 25:24.413
on the perks of your job.

25:24.517 --> 25:26.103
I should have thought.

25:26.206 --> 25:29.482
I mean... dealing with...

25:29.586 --> 25:31.413
that kind of thing on your own,

25:31.517 --> 25:34.034
that kind of trauma, uh...

25:34.137 --> 25:36.206
I've been held
at gunpoint twice.

25:36.310 --> 25:39.172
I've investigated gang violence
in New York.

25:39.275 --> 25:41.827
Covered the Turkish school
murders in San Francisco.

25:41.931 --> 25:44.724
I'm no stranger to this feeling.

25:44.827 --> 25:48.827
It just... doesn't get
any easier.

25:49.724 --> 25:51.655
No, I guess it doesn't,

25:51.758 --> 25:55.586
and it's, um, it's awkward.

25:58.000 --> 25:59.310
It's so awkward.

25:59.413 --> 26:01.413
So awkward.

26:02.206 --> 26:04.275
I don't know what a luncheon is
or why the last three letters

26:04.379 --> 26:07.379
of the word are necessary
other than to sound pretentious.

26:08.862 --> 26:10.896
But I do know

26:11.000 --> 26:14.586
that eating fancy food and
standing in a corner with you

26:14.689 --> 26:17.000
doesn't sound
like such a bad time.

26:19.620 --> 26:22.862
For me
it's-it's-it's kind of like I,

26:22.965 --> 26:27.827
I wonder if I'll ever feel
things the same way again.

26:27.931 --> 26:30.586
I mean, you-you condition
yourself to-to get through it,

26:30.689 --> 26:33.689
but once it's over...

26:35.413 --> 26:37.793
...who are you left with?

26:39.103 --> 26:42.655
Sometimes, when I feel numb,

26:42.758 --> 26:45.965
I try to focus on one thing.

26:47.275 --> 26:49.379
Like a detail of a story
that I know is true.

26:49.482 --> 26:52.620
And then fit in the rest
of the pieces from there.

26:53.620 --> 26:55.655
No, some unsolicited advice.

26:59.000 --> 27:01.655
Pick up, pick up,
pick up, Walker.

27:03.793 --> 27:04.862
- I should get this.
- Take it.

27:04.965 --> 27:06.241
- Okay.
- Please.

27:08.689 --> 27:09.965
Trey, hey, what's up?

27:10.068 --> 27:10.965
I'm kinda in the middle
of something.

27:11.068 --> 27:12.482
Hey, hey, Walker, listen,

27:12.586 --> 27:15.275
the perp that you arrested
was released an hour ago.

27:15.379 --> 27:17.379
There was no evidence of intent
to freeze the servers,

27:17.482 --> 27:20.482
and get this, the hostage
isn't pressing any charges.

27:20.586 --> 27:22.137
<i>He held a knife at her throat,</i>

27:22.241 --> 27:24.275
<i>and she's just letting him
walk away scot-free?</i>

27:24.379 --> 27:27.379
I found something suspicious
on the cam footage.

27:27.482 --> 27:30.103
If the perp didn't want
to freeze the servers,

27:30.206 --> 27:32.172
why break into the farm
in the first place?

27:33.172 --> 27:34.310
Maybe it had something to do

27:34.413 --> 27:35.793
with what the servers
were hosting.

27:35.896 --> 27:37.379
<i>Cassie mentioned that this guy</i>

27:37.482 --> 27:39.517
was an amateur activist.

27:40.310 --> 27:42.689
You know what?
I can check the list of clients

27:42.793 --> 27:44.724
that they sent us
after the break-in.

27:44.827 --> 27:46.517
Yeah, do that.
Uh, start with any banks

27:46.620 --> 27:48.310
or big corporations in the area.

27:48.413 --> 27:49.793
Okay.

27:49.896 --> 27:51.896
All right, just give me a sec.

27:54.137 --> 27:57.413
Uh...

27:57.517 --> 27:58.793
There's no banks.

27:58.896 --> 28:02.482
There's a fire station
in South Austin,

28:02.586 --> 28:04.413
a police academy,

28:04.517 --> 28:06.448
512 Federal.

28:06.551 --> 28:07.482
Five-- 512 Federal?

28:07.586 --> 28:09.034
The-the credit union?

28:09.137 --> 28:11.241
There are a gold mine
of ATMs there.

28:11.344 --> 28:13.724
If this guy was able to hack
into their system,

28:13.827 --> 28:15.793
that could cause a kind of chaos

28:15.896 --> 28:17.586
I don't even want
to think about.

28:17.689 --> 28:18.689
Yeah, exactly.

28:18.793 --> 28:21.310
Um, all right, heading there.

28:22.344 --> 28:23.896
Tell you what.

28:27.034 --> 28:29.344
Let's just keep taking it slow.

28:29.448 --> 28:31.827
See what happens, okay?

28:32.620 --> 28:33.517
Besides,
I can't have you getting

28:33.620 --> 28:35.034
too comfortable around me.

28:35.137 --> 28:37.724
This rambling thing you do
is far too endearing.

28:37.827 --> 28:38.896
No, I'm gonna get it
straightened out.

28:39.000 --> 28:40.137
I hope you don't.

28:45.620 --> 28:47.344
Sorry, sorry.

28:48.482 --> 28:50.379
- Walker.
- Understand.

28:50.482 --> 28:52.379
Hey, everything okay?

28:52.482 --> 28:54.655
<i>Cass, hey, uh,
emergency at 512 Credit Union.</i>

28:54.758 --> 28:56.034
<i>We got to go now.</i>

28:56.137 --> 28:59.172
<i>- I'll be right behind you.</i>
- Okay.

28:59.275 --> 29:01.034
I... I'm sorry.

29:01.137 --> 29:04.758
But thank you
for the lunch... eon.

29:04.862 --> 29:07.965
You're welcome.

29:25.482 --> 29:26.896
Lord, it's raining money.

29:27.000 --> 29:28.896
Oh, Walker's right behind me.

29:29.000 --> 29:30.482
- I'll call backup.
- All right, try to get ahold

29:30.586 --> 29:32.137
of somebody
inside the credit union, too.

29:32.241 --> 29:33.724
They might be able
to shut it off.

29:33.827 --> 29:35.827
- Hey, back away, back up.
- We've got a 10-33 in progress

29:35.931 --> 29:37.551
- down at 512 Federal.
- Back up.

29:37.655 --> 29:39.206
Everybody back up now, stop.

29:39.310 --> 29:40.517
Move, move, move.

29:40.620 --> 29:42.896
- We need all units nearby.
- What'd I say?

29:43.000 --> 29:44.482
We need all units nearby!

29:44.586 --> 29:46.172
Whoa, are you okay, sir?

29:46.275 --> 29:48.482
Stop, stop, hey, hey, hey,
everybody back up.

29:48.586 --> 29:51.379
- Back away.
- Back away from the ATM,
back up.

29:51.482 --> 29:53.758
What'd I say? Back up!

29:56.586 --> 29:57.827
I said back up!

31:15.586 --> 31:17.034
Now get your hand
out of your pocket!

31:17.137 --> 31:18.586
We have a back door
into ten more ATMs.

31:18.689 --> 31:20.379
One text to our team
and they're all gonna go off.

31:20.482 --> 31:22.000
Okay, don't do that.

31:22.103 --> 31:23.034
Let's not do that, right?

31:23.137 --> 31:24.689
How about we talk?

31:24.793 --> 31:25.827
Let's talk.

31:25.931 --> 31:27.172
I'll start.

31:27.275 --> 31:29.758
This is just
an observation, but...

31:30.586 --> 31:33.172
I don't think you actually want
to do that, do you?

31:33.275 --> 31:35.620
See, here's one thing I know--
you didn't bring any bags,

31:35.724 --> 31:37.068
you didn't take any money,

31:37.172 --> 31:40.275
so this wasn't some kind
of get-rich-quick scheme.

31:41.517 --> 31:42.724
Was it?

31:42.827 --> 31:45.551
So this isn't about you...

31:45.655 --> 31:48.275
and this isn't to launch some
sort of ransomware attack.

31:48.379 --> 31:51.931
This is about those people
back at the credit union.

31:52.034 --> 31:53.310
Am I getting warmer?

31:53.413 --> 31:55.137
- No one was supposed to...
- Alyssa.

31:55.241 --> 31:56.517
Okay, so let's say
this is about them,

31:56.620 --> 31:58.241
let's say it's to try
and help 'em, yeah?

31:58.344 --> 32:00.103
Spread the wealth a little bit?

32:00.206 --> 32:02.103
See, here's the thing.

32:02.206 --> 32:04.758
Those ATM machines have cameras,

32:04.862 --> 32:08.344
and stealing is a crime no
matter which way you slice it,

32:08.448 --> 32:12.344
and now those people are getting
aggressive, hurting each other.

32:12.448 --> 32:14.310
They are turning
against each other,

32:14.413 --> 32:16.620
all because of what you did.

32:18.413 --> 32:21.206
Now, I don't think you want that
on your conscience.

32:21.310 --> 32:22.862
So...

32:23.689 --> 32:27.827
...we can either, uh...
stand here

32:27.931 --> 32:29.517
and let more people get hurt.

32:30.413 --> 32:31.965
Or we can shut this down.

32:34.206 --> 32:35.620
It's up to you.

32:40.068 --> 32:41.310
<i>All right, I need everybody</i>

32:41.413 --> 32:43.724
to back away from the ATM now!

32:43.827 --> 32:44.827
- Back up!
- Back up!

32:44.931 --> 32:46.103
Everybody, move, move.

32:46.206 --> 32:47.965
What did I say? Stop.

32:48.068 --> 32:49.965
Back up!

32:52.793 --> 32:56.344
This money is not for you!
Put it down!

33:16.068 --> 33:18.482
Okay.
Smells really good in here.

33:19.551 --> 33:20.655
What's up with the spread?

33:20.758 --> 33:22.517
I thought you might enjoy
a night off

33:22.620 --> 33:24.896
after being
a one-man kitchen all day.

33:25.000 --> 33:27.000
Well, thank you.

33:30.517 --> 33:32.793
I was a jerk to you earlier.

33:47.310 --> 33:48.551
I got it on Monday.

33:48.655 --> 33:50.551
That's why she's been
on my mind,

33:50.655 --> 33:53.206
and, uh, I just didn't know
how to talk about it.

33:54.206 --> 33:55.793
No wonder you've been upset.

33:55.896 --> 33:57.862
<i>♪ It's something

<i>♪ But we can find

34:01.827 --> 34:03.137

34:03.241 --> 34:05.758
Thought I was gonna rip it up,

34:05.862 --> 34:07.724
but, uh, I spilled to Augie

34:07.827 --> 34:10.931
and he weirdly gave me
some good advice,

34:11.034 --> 34:14.413
and, um, now I think
I'm going to go.

34:15.620 --> 34:17.068
Okay.

34:17.172 --> 34:18.689
But not anytime soon,

34:18.793 --> 34:22.586
but, um, being here alone's
helped me realize

34:22.689 --> 34:24.896
how attached to my family
I really am.

34:25.000 --> 34:27.551
I still care about my grandma,

34:27.655 --> 34:30.448
but I know she's caused you
and your family...

34:30.551 --> 34:32.310
She's put you guys through hell,
and I-I feel so guilty,

34:32.413 --> 34:34.689
- and I-I don't want...
- Colton, why, though?

34:34.793 --> 34:37.827
That's not you
and that's not us.

34:39.137 --> 34:40.241
Sure, I need distance

34:40.344 --> 34:41.655
from my family right now,

34:41.758 --> 34:45.137
but that does not mean
you have to do the same.

34:46.068 --> 34:48.586
Playing house can wait.

34:48.689 --> 34:50.689
I want to be here,
Stel, and I just...

34:52.724 --> 34:55.413
...just need an anchor to
my life before I came to Austin.

34:55.517 --> 34:59.103
I get it, I'm here for you
no matter what you decide to do,

34:59.206 --> 35:02.172
and your feelings are
absolutely valid.

35:05.241 --> 35:06.724
- What?
- No, Augie said

35:06.827 --> 35:08.068
that same exact thing.

35:09.310 --> 35:10.965
See, what do you
even need me for?

35:11.068 --> 35:12.965
- Well...
- Mm-hmm.

35:13.068 --> 35:14.275
You smell way better.

- Mm-hmm, yes.

35:23.517 --> 35:25.517
Do you want some salad?

35:29.275 --> 35:31.137
Oh, you're-you're putting it
away?

35:31.241 --> 35:33.862
Yep. I beat everyone.
Three times.

35:35.275 --> 35:36.793
And no one wants
to take another stab.

35:36.896 --> 35:38.758
I mean, we can't have that,
can we?

35:38.862 --> 35:42.103
Somebody's got to try out
this new queen.

35:44.310 --> 35:46.000
August.

35:46.103 --> 35:48.448
This is beautiful.

35:49.344 --> 35:50.517
How long did it take you?

35:50.620 --> 35:52.862
Just, like, a couple of hours.

35:53.551 --> 35:55.000
We need more Band-Aids,
by the way.

35:59.379 --> 36:00.827
Where's Gramps?

36:00.931 --> 36:02.137
I want to see you two play
with the completed set.

36:02.241 --> 36:04.034
Oh, he's out working.

36:04.137 --> 36:06.517
I'm... I'm touched.

36:06.620 --> 36:07.793
Really.

36:09.586 --> 36:11.517
Well, then,
maybe you could teach me.

36:11.620 --> 36:14.482
I've always wanted
to learn how to play.

36:14.586 --> 36:17.103
And who knows? Maybe one day
I can beat Mawline the Great.

36:17.206 --> 36:19.413
You know, Augie...

36:20.448 --> 36:21.827
Thank you for this.

36:22.655 --> 36:24.413
But you know
I've already forgiven you.

36:24.517 --> 36:26.758
And you don't need
to make anything up to me.

36:26.862 --> 36:29.551
I know. I know, yeah,
the queen was just a gesture.

36:29.655 --> 36:32.551
The spending time with you
is the cherry on top.

36:34.655 --> 36:37.620
By the way, which one of these
weird-looking pieces is the rook

36:37.724 --> 36:39.000
or the knight?

36:41.413 --> 36:42.793
Well, you got some names right.

36:42.896 --> 36:44.517
- Here's the rook.
- Oh.

36:44.620 --> 36:46.344
- Looks like a castle.
- Mm-hmm.

36:46.448 --> 36:48.413
- This is the knight.
- Okay.

36:59.034 --> 37:00.413
Hey.

37:00.517 --> 37:02.034
Hey. What's going on?

37:02.137 --> 37:04.000
You are not gonna believe this.

37:04.103 --> 37:05.758
We are officially the owners

37:05.862 --> 37:09.137
of a horse rescue
and rehabilitation center.

37:09.241 --> 37:11.827
I wanted to tell you when we
could have more of a, you know,

37:11.931 --> 37:13.482
celebration, but
I-I couldn't wait any longer.

37:13.586 --> 37:16.241
I thought we were keeping
this horse rescue small.

37:16.344 --> 37:17.586
Just feeding 'em,
accommodating 'em.

37:17.689 --> 37:19.310
I-I didn't know
we were starting a whole

37:19.413 --> 37:22.482
mental health therapy center.
When-when did you file these?

37:22.586 --> 37:24.482
Today. I had a buddy
rush 'em through.

37:24.586 --> 37:27.172
And you did so
without consulting me?

37:27.275 --> 37:29.034
Well... no.

37:29.137 --> 37:31.551
You gave me a task
for the horse rescue,

37:31.655 --> 37:34.551
so I figured that you trust
my judgment on this.

37:34.655 --> 37:36.689
Son, I asked you
to get our feed delivered,

37:36.793 --> 37:39.206
not create a whole new business
on this ranch.

37:39.310 --> 37:42.448
Well, things didn't go exactly
as planned at the feed store.

37:42.551 --> 37:44.275
It got complicated and...

37:44.379 --> 37:45.827
I lost that deal.

37:45.931 --> 37:49.137
Oh, William. Why am I just
hearing about this now?

37:49.241 --> 37:51.206
Dad... it's fine.

37:51.310 --> 37:53.000
Because we're going
to help people,

37:53.103 --> 37:54.551
and now that it's a charity,

37:54.655 --> 37:56.862
we're going to save
so much money on taxes,

37:56.965 --> 37:58.827
you're not going to have
to worry about the feed deal.

37:58.931 --> 38:01.275
But there are countless
of other expenses

38:01.379 --> 38:02.379
in starting up a charity.

38:02.482 --> 38:04.103
And now the IRS is involved.

38:04.206 --> 38:06.310
Do you really want to start
that kind of stress around

38:06.413 --> 38:08.241
the ranch right now, given what
just happened to your mother?

38:08.344 --> 38:10.206
Stella and I are gonna
figure it out.

38:10.310 --> 38:13.586
Not to mention, do the Davidsons
know about this joint venture?

38:13.689 --> 38:16.413
I mean, the horses are
on their property.

38:16.517 --> 38:17.724
Colton knows.

38:17.827 --> 38:19.931
Son, he's 18.

38:20.034 --> 38:21.689
What about Dan?

38:21.793 --> 38:23.482
Denise?

38:23.586 --> 38:24.965
You know, at the very least

38:25.068 --> 38:26.724
I thought that
you were gonna be happy for me.

38:26.827 --> 38:28.551
This is something
I am passionate about.

38:28.655 --> 38:29.827
It's something
I'm actually good at.

38:29.931 --> 38:32.724
I am happy for you.

38:34.241 --> 38:35.517
But you're making
these decisions

38:35.620 --> 38:37.827
that affect my reputation.

38:37.931 --> 38:39.448
My land.

38:43.689 --> 38:45.586
Just know your place.

helped me with a case today.

39:29.137 --> 39:31.379
Did it?

39:31.482 --> 39:32.931
I'm so glad I could help.

39:33.034 --> 39:36.103
Sorry. There's a...
there's a package on my porch.

39:36.206 --> 39:37.758
<i>Which is weird,</i>

39:37.862 --> 39:39.620
because they usually get
delivered to my folks' house.

39:39.724 --> 39:41.758
But I guess it's nice, because
I've actually been trying

39:41.862 --> 39:44.172
to, uh, not bother them lately.

39:45.000 --> 39:47.068
Not be a bother
to your own parents?

39:47.172 --> 39:48.448
Uh, long story. My dad

39:48.551 --> 39:51.482
kind of asked me to, uh, move

39:51.586 --> 39:53.000
elsewhere and...

39:53.103 --> 39:54.172
Oh.
