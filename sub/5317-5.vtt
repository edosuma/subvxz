WEBVTT

00:02.013 --> 00:03.316
See, even the greatest writers

00:03.349 --> 00:04.850
have been forced
to take the odd job.

00:04.884 --> 00:06.719
Hmm. Faulkner was a mailman.

00:06.752 --> 00:08.154
Kafka, a clerk!

00:08.188 --> 00:09.889
Now, as you have said,

00:09.922 --> 00:12.658
the novelization market
is blowing up

00:12.692 --> 00:15.995
in a "ginormous" way.

00:16.027 --> 00:19.165
So I have prepared
a list of films

00:19.199 --> 00:22.735
that I would agree
to novelize for your company.

00:22.768 --> 00:24.104
The Seven Samurai,

00:24.137 --> 00:25.505
The 400 Blows,

00:25.538 --> 00:26.948
Thirty Two Short Films
about Glenn Gould...

00:26.972 --> 00:30.210
Uh, Jimmy, we're gonna
stop you right there.

00:30.243 --> 00:31.911
They don't all have
numbers in the title.

00:31.944 --> 00:35.014
We aren't the department
that handles film novelizations.

00:35.047 --> 00:36.849
We're in charge of
literary cross-promotion

00:36.882 --> 00:40.052
for all entities owned
by our parent company...

00:40.086 --> 00:41.621
Burger Hole.

00:41.654 --> 00:43.055
What does that mean?

00:43.089 --> 00:46.359
We prioritize more
amorphous in-house ideas

00:46.392 --> 00:48.894
sparked by properties in
the Burger Hole multiverse

00:48.928 --> 00:51.030
that have the most
mental real estate.

00:51.063 --> 00:53.566
Uh, for instance, uh,
this just came in yesterday.

00:53.599 --> 00:56.402
Uh, corporate was thinking
of something involving

00:56.436 --> 00:57.703
French fries?

00:59.071 --> 01:00.482
Could be a "fish out
of water" thing.

01:00.506 --> 01:03.776
Or how about this new theme
park ride... the Dragonator?

01:03.809 --> 01:06.279
It's a dragon with a goddamn
roller coaster for a tail.

01:08.248 --> 01:09.215
Maybe he's a single dad.

01:09.249 --> 01:11.617
I don't know.

01:11.651 --> 01:12.885
You're the writer.

01:12.918 --> 01:15.621
Do you have anything
with an actual narrative?

01:15.655 --> 01:18.291
Uh, we do have some TV projects

01:18.324 --> 01:20.993
that are open
for literary pollination.

01:21.026 --> 01:22.395
Um...

01:22.428 --> 01:24.230
There's, uh, Bones,

01:24.264 --> 01:26.232
Property Brothers,
Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.

01:26.266 --> 01:27.633
The Slap.

01:27.667 --> 01:30.270
There's Caught on Camera
with Nick Cannon,

01:30.303 --> 01:32.505
LA, Dog with a Blog...

01:32.538 --> 01:34.073
Sorry, NCIS: LA?!

01:34.106 --> 01:35.741
You're a fan?

01:35.775 --> 01:37.510
Heard of it.

01:37.543 --> 01:39.412
Oh, who am I kidding?
It's my favorite!

01:39.445 --> 01:41.080
Oh, great!

01:41.113 --> 01:42.915
We'll send start papers
and parameters,

01:42.948 --> 01:45.818
but you will be imagineering
your own original story.

01:45.851 --> 01:47.820
What?!

01:47.853 --> 01:49.322
Here's a copy of the show bible.

01:49.355 --> 01:51.791
Oh, do not need it!

01:51.824 --> 01:54.294
But I'll take it.

02:14.146 --> 02:15.848
Sam, I'm sure they meant

02:15.881 --> 02:19.519
"soft-ass poseur bitch"
in a meta way.

02:19.552 --> 02:21.187
You guys are in a fake fight!

02:21.221 --> 02:22.622
Keyword... "fake."

02:22.655 --> 02:24.357
No, don't hang...

02:24.390 --> 02:25.791
Goddamn it!

02:29.529 --> 02:31.531
Ooh, I love dumb procedurals.

02:31.564 --> 02:32.865
Wash over me, garbage.

02:32.898 --> 02:34.200
Numb my brain.

02:34.234 --> 02:35.468
Make me feel nothing.

02:35.501 --> 02:38.137
Okay, that is elitism, Gretchen.

02:38.170 --> 02:40.048
Would you have dismissed
Dickens for being popular?

02:40.072 --> 02:42.408
David Copperfield...
didn't even do any magic.

02:42.442 --> 02:44.977
Ooh, ya burnt, Dickens!

02:45.010 --> 02:47.913
Why are there so many
naval crimes, anyway?

02:47.947 --> 02:49.649
Oh, Navy's villains.

02:49.682 --> 02:51.050
They're one degree from pirates.

02:51.083 --> 02:52.184
Oh.

02:52.218 --> 02:53.419
Looks like we need

02:53.453 --> 02:54.830
to go discuss this
with the admiral.

02:54.854 --> 02:55.921
Play with me.

02:55.955 --> 02:57.089
Right!

02:57.122 --> 02:58.924
Shut up, both of you!

02:58.958 --> 03:01.527
All right? This is my job now.

03:01.561 --> 03:03.696
It's your-your job?

03:03.729 --> 03:07.199
Jimmy... you're not
writing recaps, are you?

03:07.233 --> 03:08.601
Oh, Jimmy.

03:08.634 --> 03:09.745
Are you grading this episode?

03:09.769 --> 03:11.271
No!

03:11.304 --> 03:14.574
I am writing the official
novelization of the show.

03:14.607 --> 03:17.009
Wow! Seriously?

03:17.042 --> 03:19.445
I am super impressed.

03:19.479 --> 03:20.613
Right. Everybody out,

03:20.646 --> 03:22.415
so I can work.

03:22.448 --> 03:24.450
Out!

03:24.484 --> 03:25.618
Fine.

03:25.651 --> 03:27.453
You, too. Oh, no problem.

03:27.487 --> 03:30.523
I've got to get
to my improv comedy class.

03:30.556 --> 03:32.858
And, yeah, I've been
waiting to tell you guys.

03:32.892 --> 03:34.436
It's this really cool
and exciting new thing

03:34.460 --> 03:35.928
I'm doing with my life.

03:37.330 --> 03:39.565
I'll tell you
more about it later.

03:39.599 --> 03:41.601
Bye, Jimmy.

04:15.768 --> 04:18.637
Hello?
This is customer number 7532.

04:18.671 --> 04:21.072
I don't know
how much time I have.

04:21.106 --> 04:24.777
Send over one of the tall ones.

04:24.810 --> 04:27.046
Asian.

04:34.053 --> 04:35.421
Oh, my God!

04:35.455 --> 04:36.922
What is this?!

04:36.956 --> 04:38.023
Why is this?!

04:38.057 --> 04:39.359
I thought you'd gone.

04:39.392 --> 04:41.961
I forgot my fro-yo punch card.

04:41.994 --> 04:43.429
What is this, even?

04:43.463 --> 04:45.431
None of your business!

04:45.465 --> 04:47.032
Oh...

04:47.066 --> 04:49.201
Erotic Tales?

04:52.204 --> 04:54.540
"By Jimmy Shive-Overly,

04:54.574 --> 04:56.842
age 11"?!

04:56.876 --> 04:58.077
Still holds up.

04:59.479 --> 05:03.248
This is the most Jimmy
thing you have ever done.

05:36.849 --> 05:38.484
Excuse me, sir?

05:38.518 --> 05:40.653
You may be a dog,

05:40.686 --> 05:42.488
but that doesn't
make you handicapped.

05:43.856 --> 05:44.990
And scene!

05:45.024 --> 05:46.058
Great callback, Edgar.

05:46.091 --> 05:47.993
Awesome class, you guys.

05:48.027 --> 05:49.829
Good work.

05:49.862 --> 05:51.664
Good work.

05:51.697 --> 05:53.433
Oh, and hey, you guys.

05:53.466 --> 05:55.401
My group
Hey, Put That Down Brian!

05:55.435 --> 05:58.504
Has a show tomorrow night,
so, you guys, please come.

05:58.538 --> 05:59.748
Just kidding,
don't come, don't come.

05:59.772 --> 06:00.840
I don't want you to come.

06:00.873 --> 06:02.117
Seriously, though,
if you don't come,

06:02.141 --> 06:03.108
I'll kill myself, so

06:03.142 --> 06:05.277
please come.

06:05.310 --> 06:08.013
Bye, guys! Thank you.

06:08.047 --> 06:10.049
Uh, so, so, uh, Dorothy,

06:10.082 --> 06:11.684
you're in Brian?!

06:11.717 --> 06:12.918
I didn't know they had a girl.

06:12.952 --> 06:14.053
Yeah, yeah, that's me.

06:14.086 --> 06:16.021
The lone vulva.

06:16.055 --> 06:17.533
That's the team
with Tall Nathan, right?

06:17.557 --> 06:18.691
Yeah, and Kyle and Josh.

06:18.724 --> 06:20.025
You know them?

06:20.059 --> 06:21.594
Nah, I only met
Tall Nathan once.

06:21.627 --> 06:22.928
But I'm a huge fan.

06:22.962 --> 06:24.864
In one scene he played a dude

06:24.897 --> 06:27.366
that doesn't understand sarcasm.

06:27.399 --> 06:29.401
So funny.

06:29.435 --> 06:32.137
Yeah.

06:32.171 --> 06:33.973
You want to help me
pick up the chairs?

06:34.006 --> 06:35.575
Absolutely.

06:35.608 --> 06:36.608
Cool.

06:40.012 --> 06:41.881
That's really great space work.

06:41.914 --> 06:43.916
Um, I meant the actual chairs.

06:43.949 --> 06:46.586
Ah, of course you did.

06:46.619 --> 06:48.888
Stupid.

06:48.921 --> 06:50.490
How's work?

06:50.523 --> 06:52.725
Are you still in charge
of that fake rap feud?

06:52.758 --> 06:54.560
Ugh, it's gone completely
off the rails.

06:54.594 --> 06:55.895
Honey Nutz and Shitstain

06:55.928 --> 06:58.631
wrote a dis track about
how Sam has pepperoni nipples,

06:58.664 --> 07:02.568
so he told his fans to murder
them in World of Warcraft.

07:02.602 --> 07:04.470
What have you been up to?
Not a lot.

07:04.504 --> 07:06.105
Little of this, little of that.

07:06.138 --> 07:08.407
Shot a condom full

07:08.440 --> 07:10.810
of piping hot semen into my vaj.

07:10.843 --> 07:12.612
How's the cake batter?

07:12.645 --> 07:13.979
First of all, are you okay?!

07:14.013 --> 07:15.414
I'm fine.

07:15.447 --> 07:17.583
I mean, I won't be riding
a horse anytime soon.

07:17.617 --> 07:20.419
But I'm already banned
from the equestrian center.

07:20.452 --> 07:22.922
And secondly, what?! Why?!

07:22.955 --> 07:24.990
I was just so upset about Paul.

07:25.024 --> 07:26.425
And the idea of him shoving

07:26.458 --> 07:29.995
his ding dong into that
beer cooze's hand-pussy.

07:30.029 --> 07:32.832
And Edgar's been so weird
and clingy lately.

07:32.865 --> 07:34.767
It's like I can't think straight

07:34.800 --> 07:36.969
with these guys
clogging up my brain!

07:41.641 --> 07:43.475
Seriously.

07:43.509 --> 07:46.612
I spend all day dealing
with my dumb rapper babies.

07:46.646 --> 07:48.323
And when I get home,
there's Jimmy and Edgar.

07:48.347 --> 07:50.325
And then the one chance I get
to sneak away for a quick hang

07:50.349 --> 07:51.617
with the Louise to my Thelma...

07:51.651 --> 07:52.952
Who are they?

07:52.985 --> 07:54.687
And all we talk about is men!
I know!

07:54.720 --> 07:57.489
We are complex women
with rich inner lives.

07:57.523 --> 07:59.224
For God's sakes,
let's act like it

07:59.258 --> 08:00.502
and discuss something
other than dicks

08:00.526 --> 08:02.294
and the dildos they hang off of.

08:02.327 --> 08:04.530
I'm in.

08:07.667 --> 08:10.803
So...

08:10.836 --> 08:13.138
So...

08:13.172 --> 08:15.207
I know.

08:15.240 --> 08:18.310
There was just this really
grody murder in Alabama

08:18.343 --> 08:20.680
where this woman thought
her kids were demons,

08:20.713 --> 08:23.482
so she drowned all eight
of them and dressed them up

08:23.515 --> 08:24.817
like Victorian dolls.

08:24.850 --> 08:27.887
Ugh! Postpartum murders
are so basic.

08:27.920 --> 08:29.488
Maybe we can talk
about powerful women?

08:29.521 --> 08:32.057
Like George Clooney's wife,
Amal Clooney?

08:32.091 --> 08:35.227
She's both super accomplished
and absolutely stunning.

08:35.260 --> 08:36.260
She a'ight.

08:37.361 --> 08:39.664
I guess we can shit-talk
women we know.

08:39.698 --> 08:41.409
That's within the rules, right?
Ooh, we can?!

08:41.433 --> 08:42.902
Like Becca?

08:42.934 --> 08:44.536
Ugh, that sausage wallet.

08:44.570 --> 08:46.105
Sausage wallet? I hope

08:46.138 --> 08:49.174
she gets pregnancy 'rhoids
and they leave her bedridden,

08:49.208 --> 08:50.876
and I have
to raise her baby myself.

08:50.910 --> 08:52.120
I'd parent the shit out of her.

08:52.144 --> 08:55.948
"Wear that skirt.
Don't blow that boy.

08:55.981 --> 08:58.183
This is pizza!"

08:58.217 --> 08:59.719
Time-out! Who are we?

08:59.752 --> 09:01.086
We can't talk about men,

09:01.120 --> 09:03.188
so we're talking about babies,
living and dead?

09:03.222 --> 09:05.390
Weak sauce. We can do
better than this!

09:05.424 --> 09:07.126
Oh, you're right.

09:07.159 --> 09:10.730
Men have ruined our damn minds!

09:13.933 --> 09:16.268
Tomorrow we'll meet up
for breakfast

09:16.301 --> 09:18.871
with prepared lists
of interesting, non-dude topics.

09:18.904 --> 09:20.005
Yes!

09:21.774 --> 09:23.475
This is feminism, right?

09:23.508 --> 09:25.477
Yes, it is.

09:36.255 --> 09:39.158
You guys can't come in here
anymore.

09:39.191 --> 09:40.492
Morning.

09:40.525 --> 09:42.227
How's it going? Not great.

09:42.261 --> 09:45.264
There are so many moving
parts to the NCIS universe.

09:45.297 --> 09:47.232
It's quite daunting, really.

09:49.935 --> 09:51.737
I'm sorry.

09:51.771 --> 09:53.438
I was thinking
about something funny

09:53.472 --> 09:55.240
that happened in improv class.

09:55.274 --> 09:58.944
We were all driving cars,
and I said, "Excuse me, sir",

09:58.978 --> 10:01.280
you may be a dog, but you're not
handicapped, are you?"

10:03.315 --> 10:05.417
It was a callback.

10:05.450 --> 10:07.019
If you're interested
in watching some,

10:07.052 --> 10:08.453
I stuck the calendar
on the fridge.

10:08.487 --> 10:11.590
In fact, I'm going to my teacher
Dorothy's show tonight.

10:11.623 --> 10:13.793
She's in Hey, Put That Down Brian!
Ah.

10:13.826 --> 10:16.161
You should come. Oh, that
sounds really, really fun,

10:16.195 --> 10:18.798
but you know what I
think I'd rather do?

10:18.831 --> 10:21.000
Hmm? Stab myself in the bowels.

10:21.033 --> 10:22.644
Okay. Do you know what
I'd rather experience

10:22.668 --> 10:24.770
than long-form improv?

10:24.804 --> 10:26.205
Long-form bone cancer.

10:26.238 --> 10:28.207
Point taken.
No, I don't think it is.

10:28.240 --> 10:30.776
See, you just described an
improvised comedy scene to me.

10:30.810 --> 10:32.377
That's worse than
telling someone

10:32.411 --> 10:35.214
about a dream that
doesn't feature them sexually.

10:35.247 --> 10:37.282
I mean, you've had some
awful, awful hobbies,

10:37.316 --> 10:39.018
but this is by far the worst.

10:39.051 --> 10:40.720
And I'm including heroin

10:40.753 --> 10:42.321
and not knowing things
are a school.

10:42.354 --> 10:44.924
I didn't know it was a school.

10:51.430 --> 10:55.134
All right, Lindsers,
I have here a list of things

10:55.167 --> 10:58.838
to talk about, none of which
involve stupid men.

10:58.871 --> 11:00.840
First off, "Our mothers
and how their pathology"

11:00.873 --> 11:02.742
messed us up."
Maybe it's all their fault.

11:02.775 --> 11:04.043
Yeah. Sure.

11:04.076 --> 11:06.211
But what about "Icees."

11:06.245 --> 11:09.648
Icees? Oh, I don't think
they have those here.

11:09.681 --> 11:11.516
I'm talking about
the Islamic State, Gretch.

11:11.550 --> 11:14.219
They formed their
own "cellophane."

11:14.253 --> 11:17.189
Do you think Obama has a
strategy to neutralize them,

11:17.222 --> 11:20.325
or will O-Bummer betray America
like he did with Benghazi?

11:20.359 --> 11:22.427
What the hell's going on?

11:22.461 --> 11:25.097
You told me not to
think about dicks,

11:25.130 --> 11:26.598
so my brain got real bored

11:26.631 --> 11:28.333
and I started reading
these Web sites,

11:28.367 --> 11:29.835
and then some other Web sites

11:29.869 --> 11:31.503
that disagreed with
the first Web sites.

11:31.536 --> 11:35.340
Did you know
about global warming?

11:35.374 --> 11:37.509
It's a huge threat,
but at the same time

11:37.542 --> 11:39.511
is made up by a bunch
of socialist lib-tards.

11:39.544 --> 11:41.246
My question is, who benefits?

11:41.280 --> 11:43.348
You have to follow
the money, Gretch.

11:43.382 --> 11:45.017
Big oil, the Middle East.

11:45.050 --> 11:46.551
Benghazi!

11:46.585 --> 11:48.053
I don't want to talk
about Benghazi.

11:48.087 --> 11:50.022
Nobody does!
And the Koch brothers?

11:50.055 --> 11:53.759
For some great patriots dedicated
to upholding the Constitution...

12:04.669 --> 12:06.105
Chapter 13.

12:06.138 --> 12:08.740
Our heroes race
to stop Chechen terrorists

12:08.774 --> 12:10.709
from blowing the H...

12:10.742 --> 12:12.744
off the Hollywood sign.

12:12.778 --> 12:14.213
But oh, no.

12:14.246 --> 12:16.048
There's an ambush.

12:16.081 --> 12:18.050
They've been double-crossed.

12:18.083 --> 12:19.384
Well?

12:19.418 --> 12:21.720
I'm not sure it tracks.

12:21.753 --> 12:22.931
I know it doesn't, goddamn it!

12:22.955 --> 12:24.723
Can I go back to school?
My mom says

12:24.756 --> 12:27.068
I'm the man of the house now and
that I have to get an education.

12:27.092 --> 12:29.294
Sorry, when I gave you
that sleeve of Pop-Tarts,

12:29.328 --> 12:31.530
was that for your help
or your biography?

12:37.469 --> 12:39.504
Jimmy! How's it coming?

12:39.538 --> 12:42.074
I'm sorry, Female Executive,
I can't do it.

12:42.107 --> 12:43.575
I'm a fraud of a writer.

12:43.608 --> 12:45.010
Can't I just write

12:45.044 --> 12:46.678
the roller coaster book?
We already

12:46.711 --> 12:47.913
gave that to Neil Gaiman.

12:47.947 --> 12:49.348
Jimmy, just take a break.

12:49.381 --> 12:50.615
Walk away from the proj...

13:01.226 --> 13:03.028
Honey, I'm home!
What's for dinner?

13:03.062 --> 13:04.296
Aw, Mom,

13:04.329 --> 13:06.098
carrots again?

13:08.467 --> 13:11.871
Hey. So glad
you decided to come watch.

13:11.904 --> 13:14.006
Actually,
I just came to remind myself

13:14.039 --> 13:15.941
that I am a good writer.

13:15.975 --> 13:17.642
When they ask for a suggestion,

13:17.676 --> 13:20.145
I'm gonna yell out
one of my classic heckles.

13:20.179 --> 13:21.446
"I have a suggestion.

13:21.480 --> 13:23.348
"Instead of improvising
your show,

13:23.382 --> 13:24.816
"try the written word,

13:24.850 --> 13:27.119
invented by the Mesopotamians
in 3200 BC."

13:27.152 --> 13:28.287
Shh!

13:28.320 --> 13:30.990
You shush! How dare you?
Watch the show!

13:32.491 --> 13:35.294
Hey, lady!
Give me those carrots.

13:35.327 --> 13:36.962
Don't kill me. Take the carrots.

13:36.996 --> 13:38.630
Take all the carrots. Yeah!

13:38.663 --> 13:40.866
That's a lot of carrots.
Ha-ha-ha!

13:40.900 --> 13:42.978
Uh, sir, we've been getting
complaints from customers

13:43.002 --> 13:44.469
at the health food store.

13:44.503 --> 13:46.705
I told you I wasn't good
with organic food

13:46.738 --> 13:47.973
when you hired me!

13:48.007 --> 13:50.342
And we flash back
to the day he was hired.

13:51.343 --> 13:53.412
Now, how are you

13:53.445 --> 13:54.880
with organic food?

13:54.914 --> 13:56.081
Not good.

13:56.115 --> 13:57.649
I'm gonna go
with my gut on this.

13:57.682 --> 14:01.486
Your gut should be trusted...
It's a good gentleman, sir.

14:01.520 --> 14:03.422
All right, we have
a clean-up in organic foods.

14:07.859 --> 14:09.404
But, Councilman,
vaccines are really important,

14:09.428 --> 14:11.897
but they're also
really, really bad.

14:11.931 --> 14:13.933
They're transferring me
to the state capitol.

14:13.966 --> 14:15.100
Local government

14:15.134 --> 14:16.401
is such a joke.

14:16.435 --> 14:17.769
Thanks, O-Blunder.

14:17.802 --> 14:20.672
Oh... oh, no...

14:20.705 --> 14:22.450
What? Oh, nothing. You
don't want to see this.

14:22.474 --> 14:24.243
Is this about
the Keystone Xbox pipeline?

14:24.276 --> 14:25.620
'Cause that'll
just make me madder.

14:25.644 --> 14:27.679
I found this last night.

14:27.712 --> 14:29.748
It's Paul and Amy
at the Coliseum.

14:29.781 --> 14:31.016
Amy's onstage

14:31.050 --> 14:34.086
at some concert.

14:34.119 --> 14:36.288
Amy is interpreting...

14:36.321 --> 14:38.623
for Beyoncé?!

14:38.657 --> 14:41.260
She is finger-singing Beyoncé!

14:41.293 --> 14:43.262
- Senator Pelosi's office.
- Stop calling me!

14:43.295 --> 14:45.931
Ma'am, you called us.

14:45.965 --> 14:48.433
Men are mean and
they hurt my brain.

14:53.405 --> 14:55.207
I need wine.

14:55.240 --> 14:57.809
Aw, come here, dum-dum.

14:59.278 --> 15:02.381
Let's watch some garbage TV
and get our minds off of it.

15:02.414 --> 15:05.084
Which one of the Real
Housewives are the stupidest?

15:05.117 --> 15:06.485
All of them.

15:06.518 --> 15:08.153
'Cause they're wives.

15:08.187 --> 15:09.397
Who doesn't deserve
a tasty treat...

15:09.421 --> 15:12.657
But really, it's New Jersey.

15:12.691 --> 15:14.493
How'd you come up
with the carrots thing?

15:14.526 --> 15:16.661
Well, we were talking about
supermarkets, so obviously

15:16.695 --> 15:19.831
carrots came to mind. The
connections you made out there

15:19.864 --> 15:21.833
were just... mind-blowing.

15:21.866 --> 15:23.468
Oh, thanks.

15:23.502 --> 15:25.104
Yeah, I also do Sketchthon,

15:25.137 --> 15:27.506
where we write and perform
12 sketches in 12 hours.

15:27.539 --> 15:28.673
Oh. Why do you do that?

15:28.707 --> 15:30.509
Well, I...

15:30.542 --> 15:31.977
I don't know.

15:33.012 --> 15:34.746
Hey, say...

15:34.779 --> 15:36.181
what do you think of Dorothy?

15:36.215 --> 15:37.682
You have nothing to offer her.

15:37.716 --> 15:39.351
Jimmy...
I'm being realistic, mate.

15:39.384 --> 15:41.086
You just started.

15:41.120 --> 15:44.356
These guys are at the
absolute top of their game.

15:44.389 --> 15:46.858
Tall Nathan's just done
improv on a cruise ship.

15:46.891 --> 15:49.661
Kyle's been
to Greg Proops's condo!

15:49.694 --> 15:51.030
Oh, you're right.

15:51.063 --> 15:52.864
I haven't done
anything with my life.

15:52.897 --> 15:55.200
I went straight from
high school to the army,

15:55.234 --> 15:57.036
then straight to Iraq,
and I didn't even get

15:57.069 --> 15:58.837
to see the cool parts of Iraq.

15:58.870 --> 16:02.274
I was in Fallujah, which is
basically their San Diego.

16:02.307 --> 16:03.708
I'm referring to myself, too.

16:03.742 --> 16:06.378
I'm a one-not-really-
a-hit wonder.

16:06.411 --> 16:08.880
I mean, how can I write
when there are people

16:08.913 --> 16:10.849
this brimming with talent
out there?

16:10.882 --> 16:14.286
You and I, we are
just visitors in this world.

16:14.319 --> 16:16.221
We'll pass through like shadows,

16:16.255 --> 16:19.391
and when we die...
no one will care.

16:21.260 --> 16:22.727
Oh, look! It's the chubby kid

16:22.761 --> 16:24.363
from the LensCrafters
commercials.

16:24.396 --> 16:26.398
That's why I stopped
drinking sodas,

16:26.431 --> 16:27.566
for the most part.

16:27.599 --> 16:29.068
Hey, Edgar.

16:29.101 --> 16:31.903
Tall Nathan, this is Edgar...
he's in my class. Oh, yeah!

16:31.936 --> 16:33.538
Wait, what do I know you from?

16:33.572 --> 16:35.074
Uh, no-nowhere cool.

16:35.107 --> 16:37.642
Y-You just came and volunteered
with my veterans' group.

16:37.676 --> 16:40.479
Oh, yeah! That was a lot of fun.

16:40.512 --> 16:42.747
You guys really like gay jokes.

16:42.781 --> 16:44.583
I didn't know you
were a veteran.

16:44.616 --> 16:46.751
I did a couple tours in Iraq.

16:46.785 --> 16:48.420
Dumb.

16:48.453 --> 16:49.754
Whoa.

16:49.788 --> 16:51.790
Were you... in the shit?

16:52.791 --> 16:54.759
Yeah.

16:54.793 --> 16:57.096
I guess you could say
I was in the shit.

16:57.129 --> 16:58.497
Speaking of...

16:58.530 --> 17:00.432
being in shit, uh,
did I tell you about the time

17:00.465 --> 17:01.733
the toilets broke

17:01.766 --> 17:04.103
on that improv cruise?
Get us a couple beers.

17:08.307 --> 17:09.540
That's incredible.

17:09.574 --> 17:11.675
So... what was it like?

17:11.710 --> 17:13.778
I mean, unless you'd
rather not talk about it.

17:13.811 --> 17:16.115
Oh, no, no. Uh...

17:16.147 --> 17:18.583
What do you want to know?

17:18.617 --> 17:20.152
Everything.

17:22.421 --> 17:24.756
Are you sure you didn't write
those jokes beforehand?

17:24.789 --> 17:26.023
Nope.

17:26.057 --> 17:27.459
You don't have an algorithm

17:27.492 --> 17:29.861
that changes your scenes based
on the audience suggestion?

17:29.894 --> 17:32.264
It's all just...
completely original?

17:32.297 --> 17:34.442
Yeah, I guess you could say
that, yeah. Why? What do you do?

17:34.466 --> 17:36.201
Oh.

17:36.235 --> 17:37.769
I'm a novelist.

17:37.802 --> 17:39.204
Mm. In fact, I came here tonight

17:39.238 --> 17:41.306
with a written list of heckles.

17:41.340 --> 17:43.642
Really? All right,
what were some of them?

17:43.675 --> 17:45.910
Oh. Um...

17:45.944 --> 17:47.646
Ah, this one's good.

17:47.679 --> 17:50.982
"Instead of improv comedy,
why don't you kill yourselves

17:51.015 --> 17:54.719
and impro comedy?"

17:54.753 --> 17:55.887
Mm.

17:55.920 --> 17:57.489
Mm-hmm. You don't like it.

17:57.522 --> 18:00.325
You want to... end the heckle

18:00.359 --> 18:03.027
with the meanest
part of the joke.

18:06.365 --> 18:09.334
"Improve comedy...

18:09.368 --> 18:11.035
Kill yourselves."

18:13.272 --> 18:15.140
That's really good.

18:20.379 --> 18:21.813
Hmm? Unicorn.

18:23.182 --> 18:24.516
Hey, Jimmy.

18:24.549 --> 18:26.585
I was dreaming about a unicorn.

18:26.618 --> 18:28.253
How you doing? Terribly.

18:28.287 --> 18:30.322
I met some artists
who fully exposed

18:30.355 --> 18:32.257
the depths of my own hackery.

18:32.291 --> 18:35.360
Sorry, Gretchen, I have to go throw
myself off the Hollywood sign.

18:35.394 --> 18:37.329
Nice knowing you.

18:37.362 --> 18:39.531
What are you hiding under there?

18:42.066 --> 18:43.802
You're reading my erotic tales?

18:43.835 --> 18:46.338
And after you teased me
about them relentlessly?

18:46.371 --> 18:48.340
No! Yes.

18:48.373 --> 18:50.475
Well... what do you think?

18:50.509 --> 18:52.177
Jimmy...

18:52.211 --> 18:54.012
they're hella hot!

18:54.045 --> 18:56.681
They are, aren't they?!
And to think that I've

18:56.715 --> 19:00.385
been interviewing with authors
and novelizing TV shows...

19:00.419 --> 19:03.622
Albeit great ones... while
the world awaits my second book.

19:03.655 --> 19:06.191
Who am I to deny them?
Who are you?

19:06.225 --> 19:08.893
And I finally know
what it should be.

19:08.927 --> 19:11.730
I'm gonna give the world
what I've been preparing for

19:11.763 --> 19:13.398
since I was 11:

19:13.432 --> 19:15.534
The first truly
literary erotic novel

19:15.567 --> 19:17.202
since Portnoy's Complaint.

19:17.236 --> 19:19.704
I'd jerk off to it. In fact...

19:19.738 --> 19:21.172
why don't you...

19:21.206 --> 19:23.342
read me a little bit
of the chapter

19:23.375 --> 19:24.709
in the barn. Ah...

19:24.743 --> 19:27.279
that's one of my
favorites as well.

19:32.083 --> 19:35.520
"Wallenda bathed
herself in milk."

19:35.554 --> 19:37.722
"'Aye, ' the Baker Boy thought,"

19:37.756 --> 19:40.191
"tis a fine meal I'd
make of this one.'"

19:40.225 --> 19:41.593
Oh, yeah, that's good.

19:43.228 --> 19:47.232
"He averted his eyes, his
manhood stiff and trembling

19:47.266 --> 19:48.700
"beneath his breeches.

19:48.733 --> 19:50.735
"Wallenda cried out, 'No!

19:50.769 --> 19:54.573
"'Don't you dare look away,
you naughty Baker Boy.

19:54.606 --> 19:58.243
"'Take in the wholeness
of my nudity!'

19:58.277 --> 19:59.611
And he did."

20:05.784 --> 20:08.253
In Arizona, cactus are sacred.

20:08.287 --> 20:10.689
If you steal one,
you're going to prison.

20:10.722 --> 20:12.691
But if you mess
with someone's heart,

20:12.724 --> 20:15.126
there's nothing anyone
can do about it,

20:15.159 --> 20:16.461
except me.

20:16.495 --> 20:17.929
My name is Sandra Hope,

20:17.962 --> 20:20.198
and I run Mate Check
Private Investigations

20:20.231 --> 20:21.766
with my boyfriend, Tom.

20:21.800 --> 20:23.602
