WEBVTT

00:01.553 --> 00:04.556
Well, we're movin' on up
Movin' on up

00:04.694 --> 00:07.421
To the East Side
Movin' on up

00:07.559 --> 00:12.081
To a deluxe apartment
in the sky

00:12.219 --> 00:15.049
Movin' on up
Movin' on up

00:15.187 --> 00:17.948
To the East Side
Movin' on up

00:18.087 --> 00:22.091
We finally got
a piece of the pie

00:23.782 --> 00:26.164
Fish don't fry
in the kitchen

00:26.302 --> 00:28.856
Beans don't burn
on the grill

00:28.994 --> 00:31.445
Took a whole lot of tryin'

00:31.583 --> 00:34.172
Just to get up that hill

00:34.310 --> 00:36.726
Now we're up
in the big leagues

00:36.864 --> 00:39.280
Gettin' our turn at bat

00:39.418 --> 00:41.800
As long as we live,
it's you and me, baby

00:41.938 --> 00:43.526
There ain't nothin' wrong
with that

00:43.664 --> 00:46.287
We're movin' on up
Movin' on up

00:46.425 --> 00:49.325
To the East Side
Movin' on up

00:49.463 --> 00:53.915
To a deluxe apartment
in the sky

00:54.054 --> 00:56.780
Movin' on up
Movin' on up

00:56.918 --> 00:59.783
To the East Side
Movin' on up

00:59.921 --> 01:05.755
We finally got
a piece of the pie

01:30.262 --> 01:32.920
Oh, hi, Florence.
We need some help.

01:33.369 --> 01:34.853
Whew, so do I.

01:36.234 --> 01:38.857
You don't know how hard
I've been working today.

01:38.995 --> 01:42.757
You gotta believe that was
one sale worth going out
in the cold for.

01:42.895 --> 01:46.623
Yeah, I didn't even mind
all those people
stepping on my toes.

01:46.761 --> 01:48.901
Florence, you should have
gone with us.

01:49.039 --> 01:53.078
Uh-uh. If I want somebody
stepping on my toes,
I'll go dancing with Clarence.

01:54.528 --> 01:57.324
Florence, wait till you see
what I got for Lionel.

01:57.462 --> 01:58.463
He'll never wear it.

02:00.327 --> 02:02.467
It's for me!

02:02.605 --> 02:06.574
Child, if Lionel comes
home from a business trip
and sees you wearing that,

02:06.712 --> 02:08.024
you won't be wearing it long.

02:11.096 --> 02:13.995
Well, ladies, if you don't
need me anymore,

02:14.134 --> 02:17.033
I should get back
to that cold pavement.

02:17.171 --> 02:19.173
Well, why don't you
stay a minute and warm up?

02:19.311 --> 02:20.968
Florence can get you
some coffee.

02:21.106 --> 02:23.004
Good idea.
I'll help you, Florence.

02:23.143 --> 02:25.352
Thanks for the offer,
Mrs. Jefferson, but, uh,

02:25.490 --> 02:28.803
my job is far too important
for me to take a coffee break.

02:28.941 --> 02:32.842
Well, okay, Ralph,
but that's.
But some brandy might be nice.

02:32.980 --> 02:35.120
Help yourself.
Yes, ma'am. Thank you.

02:36.880 --> 02:38.951
Well, when is Lionel
coming home?

02:39.089 --> 02:41.264
Oh, not for two more days.

02:41.402 --> 02:42.886
Oh, I really miss him.

02:43.024 --> 02:44.750
I know what you mean.

02:44.888 --> 02:48.202
When George first
went into business,
there were many, many nights

02:48.340 --> 02:51.309
I'd sit twiddling my thumbs
with nothing to do.

02:51.447 --> 02:52.827
Oh, that must have been awful.

02:52.965 --> 02:55.692
Yeah. Now I do it
when he's home.

02:59.248 --> 03:03.424
Well, I've been keeping busy
trying to find a topic
for my sociology thesis.

03:03.562 --> 03:06.289
I spent the last three nights
sitting in the library.

03:06.427 --> 03:09.119
Have you come up
with anything?

03:09.706 --> 03:11.536
Just a sore rear end.

03:13.883 --> 03:15.816
Oh, hi, Mr. Bentley.
How are you?
Oh, hi, Mrs. J. How are you?

03:15.954 --> 03:17.542
Oh, I'm fine.
I'm fine.

03:17.680 --> 03:18.888
I'll let you.
I'll let you.

03:22.478 --> 03:24.652
Is there anything you wanted,
Mr. Bentley?

03:27.655 --> 03:28.829
Well, what is it?

03:28.967 --> 03:30.451
I'm looking for Ralph.

03:30.589 --> 03:31.901
Right here, Mr. Bentley, sir.

03:32.039 --> 03:35.422
Oh, uh, Ralph, you're needed
at your post immediately.

03:35.560 --> 03:36.664
I'm on my break.

03:36.802 --> 03:38.356
Whoever it is can wait.

03:38.494 --> 03:40.806
I don't think Mr. Whittendale
likes to be kept.
Whittendale?

03:40.944 --> 03:42.567
Yes, sir.
Thank you, sir.

03:43.568 --> 03:45.880
Hi, Jenny.
Oh, hi, Mr. Bentley.

03:47.986 --> 03:49.263
Am I okay?

03:49.401 --> 03:51.161
No, I think you got
a cavity back there.

03:54.751 --> 03:56.236
Oh, by the way, Jenny.

03:56.374 --> 03:58.272
If you're looking for
a topic for your thesis,

03:58.410 --> 04:01.033
the life of
a New York doorman
might be good.

04:01.171 --> 04:04.968
No one realizes
the contributions
he makes to mankind.

04:05.693 --> 04:07.385
Thank you, Mrs. Jefferson.

04:07.523 --> 04:10.250
Or the contributions mankind
makes to him.

04:11.872 --> 04:13.874
Touche, Mrs. Willis, touche.

04:16.463 --> 04:17.878
You're doing a thesis, Jenny?

04:18.016 --> 04:19.845
Oh, yeah.
If I can find a topic.

04:19.983 --> 04:21.502
Oh, yes, I know that problem.

04:21.640 --> 04:24.298
When I was at Oxford once,
I spent six weeks
in the library

04:24.436 --> 04:26.127
trying to find
the perfect subject.

04:26.266 --> 04:28.475
Did you find one?
Yes, the librarian.

04:29.614 --> 04:32.237
I spent the next six weeks
studying her. Woof!

04:33.273 --> 04:34.446
Well, I better get going.

04:34.584 --> 04:35.896
Good luck
with your thesis, Jenny.

04:36.034 --> 04:37.104
Thank you, Mr. Bentley.

04:37.242 --> 04:39.209
Hey, wait a minute.
Yes?

04:39.348 --> 04:41.142
What did you finally do
for your thesis?

04:41.281 --> 04:43.731
Oh, I explored
a fascinating subject.

04:43.869 --> 04:46.769
The memory capacity
of the human mind.

04:46.907 --> 04:48.840
Oh, that does
sound interesting.

04:48.978 --> 04:50.566
Did you get a good grade?

04:50.704 --> 04:51.843
I don't remember.

04:54.294 --> 04:55.329
BENTLEY: Hi, Marcus.

04:56.813 --> 04:58.436
Mrs. Jefferson,
is Mr. Jefferson here?

04:58.574 --> 05:01.197
Goodbye, Marcus.
Oh, sorry, Mr. Bentley.

05:01.335 --> 05:03.751
Uh, he's at
a meeting downtown.

05:03.889 --> 05:05.443
Oh, man.

05:05.581 --> 05:08.722
Well, is there something
I can do for you?
No.

05:09.619 --> 05:10.586
Yeah.

05:11.172 --> 05:12.104
No.

05:12.242 --> 05:14.210
Marcus, what is it?

05:14.348 --> 05:18.387
Well, I was wondering
if he could give me
a little advance on my pay.

05:18.525 --> 05:20.354
Oh, sure.
How much do you need?

05:20.492 --> 05:21.528
$200.

05:23.392 --> 05:24.807
Two hundred?

05:24.945 --> 05:27.085
Marcus, are you
in some kind of trouble?

05:27.223 --> 05:30.330
He is if he thinks
Mr. Jefferson's gonna
give him $200.

05:32.573 --> 05:33.712
The money's not for me.

05:33.850 --> 05:34.920
It's for Lamar.

05:35.058 --> 05:36.336
Who's Lamar?

05:36.474 --> 05:38.752
Well, he's a dude
in the old gang
I used to run with.

05:38.890 --> 05:41.755
You see, he got in a little
accident and wound up
in the hospital.

05:41.893 --> 05:42.997
What happened to him?

05:43.135 --> 05:44.827
Well, he was walking
down the street

05:44.965 --> 05:47.692
when these two dudes
from another gang
beat his head in with a pipe.

05:49.107 --> 05:51.178
That doesn't sound like
an accident to me.

05:51.316 --> 05:52.869
It was an accident
they didn't kill him.

05:54.630 --> 05:56.666
I thought you broke away
from that gang.

05:56.804 --> 05:58.565
I did. But they're still
my friends,

05:58.703 --> 05:59.980
and they need my help.

06:00.118 --> 06:03.052
Now L.C. is gonna meet me
at the store in 10 minutes

06:03.190 --> 06:04.156
to pick up the money.

06:04.571 --> 06:05.710
Who is L.C.?

06:05.848 --> 06:07.297
Well, he's another dude
in the Black Widows.

06:07.988 --> 06:09.748
My old gang.

06:09.886 --> 06:12.579
Well, if you really need it,
Marcus, I'll lend you
the money.

06:12.717 --> 06:13.787
Well, all right!

06:13.925 --> 06:15.305
Uh, Marcus?

06:15.444 --> 06:17.411
Do you think you could
introduce me to L.C.?

06:17.549 --> 06:18.861
Uh, what for?

06:18.999 --> 06:21.691
Well, I think I just
found the perfect topic
for my thesis.

06:21.829 --> 06:24.418
"Inside A Harlem Street Gang."

06:24.556 --> 06:27.110
Uh-uh. Forget it, Jenny.
That's too dangerous.

06:27.248 --> 06:29.630
Oh, Mama, you...
If you wanna write about
something inside,

06:29.768 --> 06:31.736
write about inside
a butterfly collection.

06:32.564 --> 06:33.807
Your mother's right, Jenny.

06:33.945 --> 06:36.534
I mean, you have no idea
what goes on in that gang.

06:36.672 --> 06:38.743
See, that's why I wanna
talk to L.C.

06:38.881 --> 06:40.676
But it ain't gonna
do you no good.

06:40.814 --> 06:42.263
And the only thing
you're gonna get
out of him

06:42.402 --> 06:43.989
is "I didn't do it,"
"I wasn't there,"

06:44.127 --> 06:46.854
and "I don't know nothing
about nothing."

06:46.992 --> 06:49.719
Here, Marcus.
Thanks, Miss Jefferson.
I really appreciate it.

06:50.479 --> 06:51.756
See you all later.

06:53.689 --> 06:55.242
Uh, Marcus.

06:55.380 --> 06:57.658
Marcus, wait a minute.

06:57.796 --> 07:01.973
Damn.
Don't worry, Jenny.
You'll find another topic.

07:02.111 --> 07:06.253
Uh, yeah. If I'm gonna find
a topic, I better
do some research.

07:06.391 --> 07:07.703
You're going to the library?

07:07.841 --> 07:10.153
Uh, yeah. The library.

07:10.291 --> 07:12.362
Well, don't forget
we're having dinner
here tonight.

07:12.501 --> 07:14.019
Oh, don't worry.
I'll be here. Bye.

07:17.091 --> 07:19.956
160, 180, 200.

07:20.094 --> 07:21.889
Thanks, man. I owe you one.

07:22.027 --> 07:24.789
Wrong. You owe me 200.

07:24.927 --> 07:26.963
I knew you'd
come through, man.
It's for a good cause.

07:27.101 --> 07:29.138
Yeah. You know,
this is the first time

07:29.276 --> 07:32.728
I ever thought of Lamar's head
as a good cause.

07:34.315 --> 07:35.731
Hey, how are
the rest of the dudes?

07:35.869 --> 07:37.698
They're waiting.
Waiting?

07:37.836 --> 07:41.391
For what?
To hit the Pallbearers for
what they did to Lamar.

07:41.530 --> 07:43.773
Man, ain't you tired
of that mess?

07:43.911 --> 07:45.326
Man, it's the only scene
I know.

07:45.465 --> 07:46.845
But you ain't no dummy.

07:46.983 --> 07:48.398
You got it up here.

07:48.537 --> 07:50.021
And you're wasting it
out there.

07:50.504 --> 07:53.024
Hey, Marcus.

07:53.162 --> 07:54.439
Oh, Lord.

07:56.821 --> 07:58.029
You must be L.C.

07:58.167 --> 07:59.962
I must be dreaming.

08:00.100 --> 08:01.170
Who are you?

08:01.308 --> 08:03.793
Uh, Jenny's a friend, man.
She's cool.

08:03.931 --> 08:05.726
Oh, she's more than cool.

08:05.864 --> 08:09.040
She's just about
the finest fox I've ever seen.

08:09.178 --> 08:10.800
Oh, she's also married.

08:10.938 --> 08:13.354
So what?
To my boss' son.

08:13.493 --> 08:17.945
Uh-oh.
Uh, I'm Jenny Jefferson,

08:18.083 --> 08:20.845
and I'm doing a thesis.
And I was wondering if...
Well what's a thesis?

08:20.983 --> 08:23.848
Uh, it's a paper for school,
like a book.

08:23.986 --> 08:25.159
A book?

08:25.297 --> 08:27.576
Yeah, and I.
I'd like to write
about street gangs

08:27.714 --> 08:28.715
and how they operate.

08:28.853 --> 08:31.234
Jenny, this isn't cool.
May I help you?

08:31.372 --> 08:33.340
Marcus, could you get this
for me, please?

08:33.478 --> 08:35.515
Oh, sure.

08:35.653 --> 08:38.000
Do you mind if
I ask you a few questions?

08:38.138 --> 08:40.347
You know,
about your gang
and what they do.

08:40.485 --> 08:41.797
I'll tell you what they do!

08:41.935 --> 08:43.523
They mug old people!

08:46.733 --> 08:48.769
Now that ain't true, Grandma.

08:50.046 --> 08:51.772
We mug young people, too.

08:52.497 --> 08:53.498
Boo!

08:55.500 --> 08:56.536
Hey, I gotta run.

08:56.674 --> 08:57.951
Lamar's waiting
for this money.

08:58.089 --> 09:01.195
Uh, hey, uh, wait up.

09:01.333 --> 09:06.131
Um, can we go
and have some
coffee and talk?

09:06.269 --> 09:08.582
Oh, Mama.

09:08.720 --> 09:11.102
You got the dime,
I got the time.

09:12.517 --> 09:14.243
Um, how many members
do you have?

09:18.523 --> 09:20.042
Florence, where's the shrimp?

09:20.180 --> 09:21.181
GEORGE: Weezy!

09:21.319 --> 09:22.665
Sounds like he's
in the bedroom.

09:29.120 --> 09:30.708
I wonder what's keeping Jenny.

09:30.846 --> 09:33.089
Maybe she got hung up
at the library.

09:33.227 --> 09:34.746
Weezy, where'd you get
this thing?

09:36.506 --> 09:39.440
At Macy's.
They had a giant sale.

09:39.579 --> 09:42.720
Oh, yeah? Well that's
where this thing belongs,
on a giant.

09:42.858 --> 09:45.481
FLORENCE: I'll get it.

09:45.619 --> 09:46.965
This sweater looks terrible.

09:47.103 --> 09:50.072
Maybe you're not
wearing it right.
Say what?

09:55.146 --> 09:58.218
There. Now that looks
a lot better.

09:58.356 --> 10:00.323
It sure does.
Now I don't have to
look at you.

10:03.016 --> 10:04.500
That was Jenny
on the phone.

10:04.638 --> 10:06.122
Is she running late?

10:06.260 --> 10:08.366
Before the night's over,
she may be running
for her life.

10:10.023 --> 10:11.231
What do you mean?

10:11.369 --> 10:12.922
Well, she said she can't
make it for dinner.

10:13.060 --> 10:15.304
She's up in Harlem
with the Black Widows.

10:15.442 --> 10:16.823
What?

10:16.961 --> 10:19.377
Well who are the Black Widows?
A senior citizen's group?

10:27.557 --> 10:31.285
No. It's a street gang.

10:31.423 --> 10:34.357
Our daughter has joined
a street gang?

10:34.495 --> 10:37.844
No, she said to tell you
that she's doing some research
on her thesis.

10:37.982 --> 10:40.536
She also said to tell you
not to worry.

10:40.674 --> 10:43.884
Oh.
But if I was you,
I'd be worried to death.

10:45.955 --> 10:49.407
Oh, Tom!
Now don't worry, Helen.

10:49.545 --> 10:52.962
I'll call her back.
Florence, where was Jenny
calling from?

10:53.100 --> 10:54.930
Probably some phone booth.

10:55.068 --> 10:57.104
Where do the Black Widows
hang out?

10:57.242 --> 10:58.658
Anywhere they want to.

11:00.383 --> 11:02.662
That's Marcus' old gang.
He should know.

11:02.800 --> 11:04.249
Good idea. I'll call him.

11:04.387 --> 11:06.527
Forget it, Weezy.
Marcus ain't got no phone.

11:06.666 --> 11:09.634
Well, I'll just go up
to Harlem and get Jenny.

11:09.772 --> 11:12.188
Willis, are you crazy?

11:13.224 --> 11:14.535
You don't even
know where she is.

11:14.674 --> 11:16.020
Where there's a will,
there's a way.

11:16.158 --> 11:18.229
And where there's a Willis,
there's a dumb idea.

11:19.679 --> 11:21.232
I'll go with you, Tom.
Me, too.

11:21.370 --> 11:23.234
Hold it, Weezy.
Look, you ain't going nowhere.

11:23.372 --> 11:25.512
Now if you wanna go through
with this dumb idea,
you go right ahead.

11:25.650 --> 11:27.272
But you should take
somebody with you
who knows the streets.

11:27.410 --> 11:28.998
Oh, thank you, George.

11:29.516 --> 11:30.690
Not me! Florence!

11:34.141 --> 11:36.661
Uh-uh. The only thing
I know about them streets

11:36.799 --> 11:38.111
is to stay off of them.

11:39.837 --> 11:41.286
Okay, Willis,
I'll go with you.

11:41.424 --> 11:42.840
Oh, thank you, George.

11:42.978 --> 11:44.531
Look, I'm just doing this
for Lionel.

11:44.669 --> 11:46.878
Call us in a half-hour
and let us know where you are.

11:48.500 --> 11:50.088
I don't think they can
do that, Mrs. Jefferson.

11:50.226 --> 11:51.503
Why not?

11:51.641 --> 11:53.713
Because you can't make
phone calls from the morgue.

12:08.831 --> 12:09.832
Come on, Willis.

12:17.391 --> 12:19.980
No one's here.
I can see that.

12:20.118 --> 12:21.637
Would you put that
damn stick down?

12:21.775 --> 12:23.570
George, what if we need
some protection?

12:23.708 --> 12:25.814
Look, if anything happens,
we've got all the
protection we need.

12:25.952 --> 12:27.885
We do?
Yeah, me!

12:35.030 --> 12:36.686
Are you sure this is
the right place?

12:36.825 --> 12:38.792
Look, the wino said this
is where the Black Widows
hang out.

12:39.586 --> 12:40.829
But he was drunk.

12:40.967 --> 12:42.796
That's right. He was too drunk
to make up a lie.

12:44.211 --> 12:45.178
Wait a minute.

12:47.007 --> 12:50.114
George, come over here and see
if you could look through
this keyhole.

12:50.252 --> 12:51.701
Why can't you look at it?

12:51.840 --> 12:53.427
Because you're closer
to the ground.

12:55.464 --> 12:58.985
Willis, I don't know.
Come on, George, my daughter's
life may depend on this!

13:00.469 --> 13:02.678
Can you see anything?
Nothing.

13:02.816 --> 13:04.369
You can't see anything or
there's nothing in there?

13:04.507 --> 13:06.233
Look, if something's in there,
I can't see it.

13:06.371 --> 13:07.683
If nothings in there,
I can't see it.

13:07.821 --> 13:08.995
Now how the hell am I
supposed to know

13:09.133 --> 13:11.066
if I ain't seeing something
or I ain't seeing nothing.

13:11.929 --> 13:13.931
Jenny ain't here, so let's go.

13:14.069 --> 13:15.518
But shouldn't we try
someplace else?

13:15.656 --> 13:17.658
Yeah, my dining room.
She's probably having dinner.

13:17.797 --> 13:19.557
Including my share,
so come on.

13:21.662 --> 13:24.424
Shh.

13:32.225 --> 13:36.263
I'm telling you, Rollo,
that chick you was with
last night was ugly.

13:37.678 --> 13:39.025
Ugly? Ugly?

13:39.163 --> 13:41.613
What you know
about ugly?

13:41.751 --> 13:44.962
Hey, Drey, I've been hanging
out with you for years.

13:48.137 --> 13:49.483
Yeah, it look like
we're early.

13:49.621 --> 13:51.416
Yeah, ain't nobody
showed up yet.

13:51.796 --> 13:52.832
Cool.

13:54.834 --> 13:57.629
I don't see nobody here.
Do you?

14:04.913 --> 14:06.776
Hey, Slick.

14:06.915 --> 14:09.331
Let's go out
and get something to eat

14:09.469 --> 14:11.574
before the meeting starts.
Right on, right on.

14:13.611 --> 14:15.613
Boy, that sure was
a close one.

14:17.649 --> 14:20.066
It was nothing, Willis.
I could have handled
them kids if I had to.

14:20.204 --> 14:21.308
And you might have to.

14:22.827 --> 14:24.691
Hey!

14:24.829 --> 14:26.175
I was just kidding.
How you doing?

14:26.313 --> 14:27.694
Better than you, blood.

14:29.351 --> 14:30.904
What you two dudes
doing here, man?

14:31.042 --> 14:32.388
Who, us?

14:32.526 --> 14:34.390
We're from the gas company.
We came to check the meter.

14:36.047 --> 14:37.083
Yeah.

14:38.153 --> 14:40.155
We ain't got no meter.

14:40.293 --> 14:41.950
Oh, well, in that case,
there ain't nothing
to check. Ha!

14:42.088 --> 14:43.503
Come on, Willis, let's go.

14:43.641 --> 14:45.850
Oh no, Willis.
Let's stay, huh?

14:45.988 --> 14:48.508
Now, now, now, now, now,
take it easy.

14:48.646 --> 14:50.130
I'll tell you the truth.

14:50.268 --> 14:52.098
We're here because
we're looking for my daughter.

14:52.236 --> 14:56.343
Your daughter? This ain't no
day care center for no
hon-hon-honkies.

14:59.070 --> 15:01.797
But you don't understand.
She said that she was with
the Black Widows.

15:01.935 --> 15:05.663
So we thought.
You know, I get the feeling
these turkeys are cops, man.

15:05.801 --> 15:07.251
Cops? Do I look like a cop?

15:07.837 --> 15:09.322
He's right, Slick.

15:09.460 --> 15:11.807
They don't al-al-allow
no midgets on
the police force.

15:14.810 --> 15:16.639
Listen, tur-tur-tur-turkey.

15:21.437 --> 15:23.060
All right, you listen.

15:23.198 --> 15:25.752
Now we done heard enough
of your jive, man.
Now turn around, huh?

15:25.890 --> 15:28.686
Why?
Because we told you to.

15:28.824 --> 15:31.137
Look, I don't take orders
from nobody.
Oh, you don't?

15:31.275 --> 15:32.724
Oh, I do. I do.

15:35.693 --> 15:39.559
Look, Shorty,
now you're talking
to a Black Widow, dig?

15:39.697 --> 15:42.700
Now when we say jump,
man, people don't ask why.

15:42.838 --> 15:44.184
They ask how high?

15:45.979 --> 15:47.429
You're just lucky
you're carrying a gun.

15:47.567 --> 15:49.362
You're just lucky
I ain't used it yet.

15:49.500 --> 15:51.951
Yeah, now put-put-put
your hands over your head.

15:52.089 --> 15:54.850
This is so helpful. Oh!
What's going on here?

15:54.988 --> 15:57.715
Uh, L.C., that's my father.
Hey, leave him alone, Slick.
He's cool.

15:57.853 --> 15:59.579
Okay, Shorty, you free.

15:59.717 --> 16:01.719
I ain't her father, he is.
Oh?

16:01.857 --> 16:03.100
But I'm her father-in-law.

16:06.172 --> 16:08.588
You're
her father?

16:08.726 --> 16:10.452
I know. I look too young,
don't I?

16:13.800 --> 16:15.319
What are you two doing here?

16:15.457 --> 16:17.045
That's what I keep
asking myself.

16:17.183 --> 16:18.805
Darling, we were worried
about you.

16:18.943 --> 16:20.772
Oh, well there's nothing
to worry about.

16:20.910 --> 16:22.291
I've been with L.C.

16:22.429 --> 16:25.225
He's been showing me around
the Black Widows territory.

16:25.363 --> 16:27.124
Territory.

16:28.159 --> 16:30.403
L.C., when did you become
a tour guide, man?

16:30.541 --> 16:32.992
It's cool, Slick.
She's writing a book
on street gangs.

16:33.130 --> 16:34.441
No, she isn't!
Come on, Jenny.

16:34.579 --> 16:35.925
Oh, Daddy, relax.

16:36.064 --> 16:37.720
There is nothing
to be afraid of.

16:37.858 --> 16:39.860
That's what I keep
telling him. Now let's get
the hell out of here.

16:41.207 --> 16:43.243
No, no, no. Not yet.

16:43.381 --> 16:45.142
I want to find out more
about the gang.

16:45.280 --> 16:47.351
You're writing a book
on gangs, huh?

16:47.489 --> 16:50.526
Well, it's not really
a book. It's a paper
for school.

16:50.664 --> 16:52.977
Yeah, is anybody
gonna get to read it?

16:53.115 --> 16:55.359
Yes.
Oh, yeah?
Well, my name is Rollo.

16:55.497 --> 16:56.843
That's with
two Ls.

16:56.981 --> 17:00.881
Yeah, doll. I'm Slick.
That's one L.

17:01.020 --> 17:03.091
Who cares? That's no L.

17:05.231 --> 17:09.028
Hey, everybody.
What's shaking?
ALL: Hey!

17:09.166 --> 17:11.271
Who's this?
This is Huey.
He's in the gang.

17:11.409 --> 17:15.241
Oh, yeah?
Who changes his diapers?

17:15.379 --> 17:17.657
If you don't shut up,
I'm gonna change your face.

17:27.080 --> 17:28.702
Hey, lady, you're pretty.

17:29.669 --> 17:32.361
Oh, thank you, Huey.

17:32.499 --> 17:33.604
Want a piece of gum?

17:33.742 --> 17:34.812
Uh-oh.
Mmm-hmm.

17:34.950 --> 17:35.951
Oh, I'd love some.

17:36.089 --> 17:37.297
Piece of gum.
Huey!

17:37.435 --> 17:40.128
Get down, get down.
Hey, cool it!

17:40.266 --> 17:41.301
She's too old for me.

17:41.439 --> 17:44.339
Oh? How old are you, Huey?

17:44.477 --> 17:45.961
Twelve and a half.

17:46.099 --> 17:47.652
You're just a boy.

17:47.790 --> 17:49.102
Who you calling "boy"?

17:50.586 --> 17:51.898
I mean, young man.

17:52.036 --> 17:54.245
I don't understand. You...

17:55.315 --> 17:57.593
You let him in your gang
and he's only 12?

17:57.731 --> 17:59.388
Well, we have to grow up fast
around here.

17:59.526 --> 18:01.597
And besides, we need Huey.

18:01.735 --> 18:03.772
He can rip something off
and disappear.

18:03.910 --> 18:06.292
Before anybody
misses it, huh?
Yeah!

18:06.430 --> 18:09.812
That's right. 'Cause next to
me, he's the fastest
r-r-runner we got.

18:10.606 --> 18:11.952
You're jiving, Rollo.

18:12.091 --> 18:14.679
I can beat you
running backwards.

18:14.817 --> 18:15.818
No way, Huey.

18:15.956 --> 18:17.406
Yeah?
Yeah.

18:17.544 --> 18:19.891
You run backwards,
and I'll bet I can beat you.

18:23.723 --> 18:28.279
What does your family think
about your belonging
to a gang?

18:28.417 --> 18:30.005
The gang is my family.

18:30.143 --> 18:32.697
Shoot, Domino is like
a father to me.

18:33.353 --> 18:34.941
Um, who is Domino?

18:35.597 --> 18:37.392
He's our leader, lady.

18:37.530 --> 18:40.222
Uh, well why is Domino
the leader?

18:40.360 --> 18:43.777
Uh, well, for one thing,
he's got the most medals.

18:43.915 --> 18:45.193
Medals?
Yeah.

18:45.917 --> 18:48.403
Battle scars. See?

18:48.541 --> 18:50.577
I got this one
in a knife fight.

18:50.715 --> 18:52.096
Oh, that ain't nothing.

18:52.234 --> 18:55.203
I got this one compliments
of a Pallbearer's bullet.

18:55.962 --> 18:57.515
Oh, you got shot.

18:57.653 --> 18:59.655
Oh, no. They threw
the bullet at me.

19:05.937 --> 19:07.491
I ain't got no medals yet.

19:07.629 --> 19:10.149
But Domino says I'll get some
sooner or later.

19:10.287 --> 19:12.910
I don't believe this.
You're getting stabbed
and shot

19:13.048 --> 19:13.945
and you don't
seem to care.

19:14.083 --> 19:15.568
Oh, we care.

19:15.706 --> 19:18.398
That's why we fight back.
Oh, right.

19:20.711 --> 19:22.091
What good does it do?

19:22.230 --> 19:23.610
It does a lot of good.

19:23.748 --> 19:26.199
It teaches people
they can't push us around.

19:26.337 --> 19:28.753
ROLL: That's right!
'Cause there ain't nobody...

19:28.891 --> 19:31.342
Hey, Domino!

19:31.480 --> 19:33.137
Hey, what's up?

19:33.275 --> 19:35.622
Well, I'll tell you
what's down.

19:38.349 --> 19:39.799
One ugly Pallbearer.

19:39.937 --> 19:41.663
All right, all right.

19:42.836 --> 19:43.837
You shot him?

19:43.975 --> 19:45.632
Right on.
Right.

19:45.770 --> 19:47.634
This one is for Lamar.

19:47.772 --> 19:50.119
Right.
Right on for Lamar.

19:50.258 --> 19:52.191
Here, Huey,
put this away for me.

19:52.329 --> 19:53.571
Sure, Domino.

20:02.131 --> 20:04.272
You actually shot someone?

20:04.410 --> 20:06.377
Who is she?
Hey, she's cool.
She's a friend of mine.

20:06.515 --> 20:08.034
Well, she ain't
a friend of mine.

20:08.793 --> 20:09.967
What is she doing here?

20:10.105 --> 20:12.176
She wants to write
a book on our gang.
What?

20:12.314 --> 20:13.798
Are you crazy, L.C.?

20:14.627 --> 20:15.593
Get her out of here.

20:16.698 --> 20:17.630
Who are these turkeys?

20:17.768 --> 20:19.563
I'm Tom Willis.
Nice to meet you.

20:20.909 --> 20:23.912
And this is Marcus' boss.
He put up the bread
for Lamar.

20:24.050 --> 20:28.537
Bread for Lamar?
Uh, Mrs. Jefferson gave Marcus
$200 for Lamar's doctor bills.

20:28.675 --> 20:29.780
$200?

20:30.298 --> 20:31.575
Surprised?

20:31.713 --> 20:33.197
Oh, uh, yeah.

20:33.335 --> 20:35.924
I'm just surprised
she didn't give him $300
like I told her to.

20:38.444 --> 20:40.239
That's Weezy's trouble.
She's too stingy.

20:41.447 --> 20:43.380
Thanks for helping out.

20:43.518 --> 20:46.210
Now why don't you help
yourself and your friends
out of here?

20:46.348 --> 20:48.695
Oh, oh no, I...
I haven't finished talking
to your gang.

20:48.833 --> 20:49.938
Yes, you have.

20:50.076 --> 20:51.836
Come on, Jenny.
Hold it. Just hold it.

20:53.700 --> 20:54.701
Gimme this.

20:54.839 --> 20:56.565
Well now, wait.
Those are my notes.

20:59.361 --> 21:01.743
I don't want you talking
to anyone in my gang
anymore. You dig?

21:01.881 --> 21:04.124
She digs.
I mean, right on.

21:05.919 --> 21:07.990
I mean, she hears you.

21:08.128 --> 21:09.716
Come on, Willis.
Quit while you're alive.

21:11.787 --> 21:14.652
Bye.
You all come back now,
you hear?

21:22.453 --> 21:24.800
George, that's your third
piece of pie.

21:24.938 --> 21:26.388
No, it ain't.
It's my fourth piece.

21:27.527 --> 21:28.701
Fighting makes me hungry.

21:30.392 --> 21:31.980
George, you didn't do
any fighting.

21:32.118 --> 21:33.947
Oh, yes, I did, too.

21:34.085 --> 21:35.811
I was fighting to keep from
going upside one of those
Black Widows' heads.

21:37.813 --> 21:38.952
If you had done that,

21:39.090 --> 21:40.989
there'd be one more
black widow.

21:41.127 --> 21:42.128
Me.

21:44.233 --> 21:45.752
Anybody want anything else?

21:45.890 --> 21:48.445
Yeah. A topic for my thesis.

21:48.583 --> 21:49.791
I've got an idea, Jenny.

21:49.929 --> 21:52.241
Why don't you do your thesis
on mixed marriages?

21:52.380 --> 21:54.140
Hey, yeah!

21:54.278 --> 21:56.556
Then you could call it
"Everything You Ever Wanted
To Know About Zebras."

22:01.699 --> 22:05.427
I wish I had been
able to spend more time
with those gang members.

22:05.565 --> 22:07.602
Find out what really
makes them tick.

22:07.740 --> 22:10.639
The only thing you could learn
from them is the quickest way
to go to jail.

22:10.777 --> 22:12.261
Yeah, you're right.

22:12.400 --> 22:14.816
But there ought to be
something that somebody
could do to help.

22:14.954 --> 22:18.337
You know it's really sad
to think of a 12 year old
like Huey

22:18.475 --> 22:20.339
getting involved
in that stuff.

22:20.477 --> 22:22.099
He knows how to
take care of himself.

22:24.204 --> 22:25.447
Doorbell, Mr. Jefferson.

22:33.179 --> 22:36.147
Why don't you write about
what it's like
to work as a maid?

22:36.285 --> 22:37.770
And if you find out,
tell Florence.

22:39.427 --> 22:42.361
What do you want?
I'm looking for Jenny.
Is she here?

22:42.499 --> 22:44.604
Oh, hey, come on.

22:44.742 --> 22:46.641
Hey, you brought my purse.

22:46.779 --> 22:49.920
Come on in. Mama,
Mrs. Jefferson, Florence,

22:50.058 --> 22:51.542
this is L.C.

22:51.680 --> 22:52.923
Hi.
Hello.

22:53.061 --> 22:55.132
Okay, now that you said hello,
you can say goodbye.

22:55.270 --> 22:57.203
Look, if you still wanna
find out about our gang,

22:57.341 --> 22:58.825
I'm gonna tell you all
you wanna know.

22:58.963 --> 23:01.449
Oh, but Domino said
he didn't want me...
I know what Domino said.

23:01.587 --> 23:03.485
Now you wanna find out
about the gang or not?

23:03.623 --> 23:05.176
Well, yeah!

23:05.314 --> 23:07.420
What, what changed your mind?
Huey.

23:07.558 --> 23:10.389
Huey? That little punk?
Yeah.

23:10.527 --> 23:13.012
The Pallbearers hit us
just after you left.

23:13.150 --> 23:14.772
Huey finally got the medals
he wanted.

23:14.910 --> 23:17.188
Oh no, was he hurt bad?

23:17.844 --> 23:18.845
He's dead.

23:31.617 --> 23:32.859
Weezy, are you coming to bed?

23:33.688 --> 23:35.344
Oh, I can't sleep, George.

23:35.483 --> 23:37.450
No wonder you can't sleep.
You're sitting here
drinking coffee.

23:37.588 --> 23:39.072
Put the coffee down
and come to bed.

23:39.210 --> 23:41.834
I was just thinking about
those kids and their gangs.

23:41.972 --> 23:44.077
Look, Weezy, there's nothing
you can do about it.

23:44.215 --> 23:46.908
I mean, they had gangs
when I was a kid.
They got gangs now.

23:47.046 --> 23:49.428
Sure. Because people
are like you.

23:49.566 --> 23:52.361
They don't wanna speak out.
They don't wanna get involved.

23:52.500 --> 23:55.054
Because they're afraid of what
the gangs might do to them.

23:55.192 --> 23:56.400
Afraid? Who me?

23:56.538 --> 23:58.091
Ha! I ain't afraid of no gang.

24:00.369 --> 24:01.543
What are you doing?

24:01.681 --> 24:03.131
What I should have done
a couple hours ago.

24:04.857 --> 24:06.375
Hello, operator,
get me the police.

24:06.514 --> 24:08.274
Police?

24:08.412 --> 24:10.794
What are you gonna
say to them?
Just listen.

24:11.519 --> 24:13.106
Hello? Uh, yes.

24:13.244 --> 24:15.592
Look, I've got some
important information
on a couple of gangs

24:15.730 --> 24:17.110
that have been giving
you trouble up in Harlem.

24:17.870 --> 24:19.630
Sure, I'll hold on.

24:19.768 --> 24:22.391
You were right, Weezy.
People are too afraid
to get involved.

24:22.530 --> 24:24.428
But not George Jefferson.

24:25.256 --> 24:27.258
What? Oh, my name?
Yeah.

24:27.742 --> 24:28.708
John Smith.

24:53.733 --> 24:57.461
LOUISE: The Jeffersons was
videotaped in front of
a studio audience.
