01:24.784 --> 01:27.453
- Sure, whatever you
prefer to call it.

01:27.455 --> 01:30.656
The human situation, or
the American nightmare

01:30.658 --> 01:34.359
that's become the
international nightmare,

01:34.361 --> 01:40.232
or love, or extreme
awareness, or,

01:40.234 --> 01:42.601
this interview is live, right?

01:42.603 --> 01:45.471
I'd like to change the
subject 45 degrees,

01:45.473 --> 01:50.642
if you don't mind, um, we
only have a few more minutes.

01:50.644 --> 01:52.644
Okay, right.

01:52.646 --> 01:54.613
I'd like to start a rumor.

01:54.615 --> 01:57.449
With some luck, a few
young writers listen

01:57.451 --> 01:59.451
to this broadcast,
and they can spread

01:59.453 --> 02:01.553
the rumor to their
friends and enemies.

02:01.555 --> 02:09.461
Mm, now, now don't take
this the wrong way.

02:09.463 --> 02:12.331
What I'm about to say
is not a cry for help.

02:12.333 --> 02:16.335
It's not in any way connected
to, or interested in,

02:16.337 --> 02:20.639
the politics of victimhood,
and if anyone receives

02:20.641 --> 02:25.144
it that way, all
the worse for him.

02:25.146 --> 02:31.150
What I'd like to say is,
I'm going to kill myself.

02:31.152 --> 02:32.885
Please don't interrupt me.

02:32.887 --> 02:36.855
I am going to end
the life of Maya Dardel.

02:36.857 --> 02:39.258
My work is in decline.

02:39.260 --> 02:43.262
I, I see no need to birth
a few more mediocre books

02:43.264 --> 02:48.400
and then finally in
my 70s and 80s squirt

02:48.402 --> 02:53.338
out a few more abortions
as embarrassing as,

02:55.175 --> 02:58.310
it's disrespectful
to name names.

02:58.312 --> 03:01.246
The point is, euthanasia.

03:01.248 --> 03:03.815
It's the thing to do.

03:03.817 --> 03:07.920
I don't have any family,

03:07.922 --> 03:11.523
so I'm going to need
an heir and an executor.

03:11.525 --> 03:14.193
So I'm going to be interviewing
youngish writers here,

03:14.195 --> 03:16.461
at my house, in Los
Gatos, California,

03:16.463 --> 03:20.265
for this position, starting now.

03:20.267 --> 03:22.968
Right, right and
the guy I pick gets

03:22.970 --> 03:27.472
my house and my archives
and publishing rights,

03:27.474 --> 03:31.210
all my knickknacks and dishes

03:31.212 --> 03:33.712
and music and books
when I'm gone.

03:40.320 --> 03:42.821
Hm.

03:42.823 --> 03:45.891
So anybody talented and capable

03:45.893 --> 03:51.396
can email me by emailing
the Ithurburn agency.

03:51.398 --> 03:56.568
My agent's name is Lucas
Marcy, Lucas m-a-r-cy.

03:56.570 --> 04:03.609
Mm hmm, yep, Luc's
thrilled, death's lucrative.

04:03.611 --> 04:04.643
Um.

04:06.479 --> 04:08.447
Of course I'm serious.

04:09.916 --> 04:11.917
Don't be narrow-minded.

04:11.919 --> 04:15.554
I want young but professional,
published writers of poetry,

04:15.556 --> 04:19.858
but I'd consider a poetic
novelist or essayist.

04:21.494 --> 04:26.999
Also, also, women
need not apply.

04:27.001 --> 04:30.702
Well because I don't
like women's writing.

04:30.704 --> 04:32.037
Yes.

04:33.306 --> 04:35.974
No, no.

04:35.976 --> 04:40.679
Dickinson yes, some of it.

04:40.681 --> 04:42.514
No, no.

04:44.284 --> 04:45.517
Wolfe was a man.

04:47.287 --> 04:51.923
No, no, George Elliot was a man.

04:51.925 --> 04:54.293
Yes, no.

04:55.795 --> 04:59.498
Sontag, Sontag was
entirely a guy.

04:59.500 --> 05:02.067
I know, I slept with her.

05:05.605 --> 05:10.642
So any of you young
men out there,

05:10.644 --> 05:12.944
if you think you're it,

05:12.946 --> 05:16.348
go ahead and look
up my agent, yes?

05:27.327 --> 05:29.728
- I can show you
my work right now here.

05:29.730 --> 05:31.930
- Leave it on the floor.

05:34.467 --> 05:37.336
I probably should've
had you email me some

05:37.338 --> 05:40.339
of your work before you
drove all the way up here.

05:40.341 --> 05:45.077
- Right, I can, I can send you
some from my phone right now.

05:45.079 --> 05:47.746
- Put that
back. They disgust me.

05:47.748 --> 05:48.780
- Phones?

05:50.583 --> 05:53.785
- Other people's phones.

05:53.787 --> 05:57.456
- Right, totally, no,
I totally understand that.

05:57.458 --> 06:00.592
They're like, other
people's phones.

06:00.594 --> 06:03.695
You know, they touch your ear.

06:03.697 --> 06:06.365
They have like wax on them,

06:06.367 --> 06:09.468
other people's girlfriends'
photos on them.

06:09.470 --> 06:13.872
- Tell me with extreme candor
what you think of your talent.

06:13.874 --> 06:18.710
- Totally, I can.
Talk about that.

06:18.712 --> 06:20.112
Um.

06:31.491 --> 06:32.691
Done.

06:32.693 --> 06:34.493
- What?

06:34.495 --> 06:37.729
- No you just, you
just have to know.

06:37.731 --> 06:39.598
- Know what?

06:41.667 --> 06:44.069
- Do you have
a bathroom I could use?

06:44.071 --> 06:46.004
- I don't like other
people in my bathroom.

06:46.006 --> 06:47.906
- It's cool.

06:51.978 --> 06:54.446
- What do you think of me?

06:54.448 --> 06:57.983
- I love your work, I love
shadow, twenty-seven fold.

06:57.985 --> 07:01.486
- I meant what do you
think of me physically?

07:01.488 --> 07:03.488
- Physically?
- Mm.

07:05.558 --> 07:07.626
- I'm not really, um.

07:07.628 --> 07:10.495
- Be candid, Moses.

07:10.497 --> 07:11.696
- Candid?

07:11.698 --> 07:13.131
- Very.

07:15.701 --> 07:17.602
- I'm not really comfortable.

07:17.604 --> 07:18.970
- Who's comfortable?

07:18.972 --> 07:20.872
Just be honest.

07:20.874 --> 07:23.508
- What, do I think you're
a good-looking woman?

07:23.510 --> 07:24.509
- Yes.

07:24.511 --> 07:26.111
- I mean, yeah.

07:26.113 --> 07:30.615
- But uglier than
women your age.

07:30.617 --> 07:34.886
I'm a good piece of fruit
too long in the fridge.

07:34.888 --> 07:37.088
- That's, isn't that, like.

07:37.090 --> 07:39.991
- But good-looking enough.

07:39.993 --> 07:42.861
At least as I sit here across
from you in what appears

07:42.863 --> 07:47.833
to be some kind of
impenetrable Artemis state,

07:47.835 --> 07:50.502
enough that you're
probably wondering what

07:50.504 --> 07:53.505
it'd be like to
command me, strip me.

07:53.507 --> 07:54.739
- Strip you?

07:54.741 --> 07:57.042
- Men are this kind of machine.

07:57.044 --> 07:59.845
Women my age have
the last outer crust

07:59.847 --> 08:02.647
of our prettiness
left, and that can be

08:02.649 --> 08:06.685
combined with haughtiness
or real superiority.

08:06.687 --> 08:10.689
Until a young man badly wants
to break that outer crust.

08:10.691 --> 08:12.924
He wants to prove this and that

08:12.926 --> 08:15.126
to himself, and
the middle-aged woman.

08:15.128 --> 08:17.128
But you see,
the woman's unwise if she

08:17.130 --> 08:18.897
allows herself to be stripped.

08:18.899 --> 08:21.533
The thing about Artemis is that,

08:21.535 --> 08:24.102
is that her nakedness in
the pool in the woods,

08:24.104 --> 08:27.506
when Actaeon sees her, yes?

08:27.508 --> 08:28.907
- Um, yeah.

08:28.909 --> 08:31.109
- Her nakedness
is not just a myth

08:31.111 --> 08:33.111
about the virginity of maidens.

08:33.113 --> 08:35.780
It's a myth also
about the final,

08:35.782 --> 08:39.650
brittle sex appeal
of older women.

08:43.188 --> 08:45.724
If you were to see me naked,

08:45.726 --> 08:48.527
like Actaeon,
you would have to die.

08:55.234 --> 08:58.537
You're a mature man, correct?

08:58.539 --> 09:00.171
- Yeah.

09:00.173 --> 09:02.674
- You're not one of
these immature fumblers,

09:02.676 --> 09:07.312
one of these boys who
can't find the clitoris?

09:07.314 --> 09:10.815
- Like a, sorry,
a woman's clitoris?

09:13.953 --> 09:15.820
- Come here.

09:21.327 --> 09:24.563
Nearly any experience
is good for a writer.

09:24.565 --> 09:26.932
The same can't be said
for those who don't write.

09:26.934 --> 09:28.166
- Yeah I actually brought

09:28.168 --> 09:29.901
my work, I'd like to show you.

09:29.903 --> 09:31.703
- Come, sit.

09:34.140 --> 09:35.807
- You want me

09:35.809 --> 09:37.876
to sit next to you on the couch?

09:37.878 --> 09:39.311
- Here.

09:40.346 --> 09:41.680
- Here?

09:41.682 --> 09:42.881
- Exactly.

09:45.351 --> 09:46.785
- Okay.

09:48.054 --> 09:49.087
Here?

09:49.956 --> 09:50.989
Okay.

09:53.826 --> 09:57.696
Sorry, I'm.

10:01.701 --> 10:04.669
- Take off my tights.

10:41.907 --> 10:43.408
You're surprisingly
not bad at that.

10:45.778 --> 10:46.811
- Thanks.

10:48.881 --> 10:50.401
- Would you like
to show me your poems?

10:53.986 --> 10:56.888
But first go clean your face.

11:05.398 --> 11:07.432
- Should I just use the sink?

11:07.434 --> 11:09.401
- Mm.
- Okay.

11:31.424 --> 11:34.993
- To save us time why
don't you just show me what

11:34.995 --> 11:39.230
you're certain is your
best work in that binder.

11:39.232 --> 11:40.999
- My best?

11:41.001 --> 11:42.367
- Mm.

11:53.045 --> 11:54.846
You read it to me.

12:00.920 --> 12:04.355
- Holy shit, um,
that's the title.

12:07.326 --> 12:09.327
Holy shit, this Campbell's soup

12:09.329 --> 12:12.430
is tasty, though
it, come, though.

12:15.735 --> 12:18.737
Holy shit this
Campbell's soup is tasty,

12:18.739 --> 12:22.307
though come to think of it,
it tastes like nothing

12:22.309 --> 12:26.745
plus the idea of Warhol with
his super creepy friends,

12:26.747 --> 12:29.981
so many more than I have,
speaking fondly of the times

12:29.983 --> 12:33.251
they all had doing
nothing, doing nothing,

12:33.253 --> 12:37.856
doing nothing, doing nothing,
making a Hamlet sandwich

12:37.858 --> 12:42.227
I have to make for myself,
because I have no friends.

12:47.199 --> 12:49.033
- I'm adjuncting a
composition course

12:49.035 --> 12:50.902
at Hartwick college
in the spring.

12:50.904 --> 12:55.006
That's in New York,
the Catskills, mm,

12:55.008 --> 12:58.476
I got my MFA last year, from
the Iowa writers workshop.

12:58.478 --> 13:03.047
And I'm the editor-in-chief of
a small magazine, a Webzine.

13:03.049 --> 13:04.916
- I went to Iowa.

13:04.918 --> 13:06.951
- Did you?

13:06.953 --> 13:10.455
- Back when everyone smoked
cigarettes and nobody got aids.

13:12.191 --> 13:14.192
- Okay, there
wouldn't be any kind

13:14.194 --> 13:17.195
of legal complications,
would there?

13:17.197 --> 13:20.165
What I mean is, when you,
if you select me.

13:20.167 --> 13:22.367
I'll be far away with an alibi.

13:22.369 --> 13:24.102
I don't mean to be rude,

13:24.104 --> 13:26.204
I just think it's
best to be up front.

13:26.206 --> 13:29.374
You don't expect me to
be here, to help you?

13:29.376 --> 13:32.377
- This is not the process.

13:32.379 --> 13:34.212
- What?

13:34.214 --> 13:35.346
- The process,
it's not the process.

13:35.348 --> 13:36.815
- What's the process?

13:36.817 --> 13:38.183
- First we talk about your work,

13:38.185 --> 13:40.385
and then I, I was probably...

13:40.387 --> 13:44.155
- well that stuff that I sent
you is actually quite old.

13:44.157 --> 13:45.957
I just sent it because it seems

13:45.959 --> 13:47.826
to do well with the
editors of magazines.

13:47.828 --> 13:49.027
I'd like to show you what
I'm writing currently.

13:49.029 --> 13:50.461
- Show me.

13:50.463 --> 13:54.199
- It's uh, it's an epic poem.

13:54.201 --> 13:56.467
Or well, considering that idea.

13:56.469 --> 13:59.170
It's uh, well,
better to show you.

14:15.487 --> 14:18.189
- Cimputer, hmm?

14:18.191 --> 14:20.191
Ever been to the Tate
modern in London?

14:20.193 --> 14:21.993
- No.

14:21.995 --> 14:22.994
- But you've been to
modern art museums.

14:22.996 --> 14:24.562
- Of course.

14:24.564 --> 14:26.564
It seems ironic now,
but I actually wrote my

14:26.566 --> 14:28.366
undergraduate thesis on the
transgressive corporeality

14:28.368 --> 14:30.101
of mannequins and humans
in the early work of -

14:30.103 --> 14:32.403
- imagine three people
in a modern art museum.

14:32.405 --> 14:34.505
The first is a pot-bellied
father of four from

14:34.507 --> 14:38.142
Kentucky or provincial France
or middle Russia somewhere.

14:38.144 --> 14:41.412
He's a tourist, he only
likes landscapes and nudes

14:41.414 --> 14:43.448
and paintings of
battles and ships.

14:43.450 --> 14:46.417
He's the guy who looks the
Jackson pollock the same

14:46.419 --> 14:51.422
way he looks at your generation's
latest abstract knockoff

14:51.424 --> 14:55.159
and he says to himself
about both, Christ,

14:55.161 --> 14:57.562
what a con-job,
my kid can paint this.

14:57.564 --> 14:59.030
- Hm.

14:59.032 --> 15:00.598
Right, my kid can paint this.

15:00.600 --> 15:03.134
- Now imagine a second
person in the museum.

15:03.136 --> 15:07.372
This is you, this is
an educated person.

15:07.374 --> 15:13.077
He's visiting the museum in
an anxious, critical capacity.

15:13.079 --> 15:16.281
He goes into the room the
tourist father just left,

15:16.283 --> 15:18.316
and looks at the pollock
and looks at the knockoff,

15:18.318 --> 15:20.418
and because the knockoff
was painted very recently,

15:20.420 --> 15:24.422
it gets his attention,
and he stands there wondering

15:24.424 --> 15:27.191
if it's better than his
own mysterious canvases

15:27.193 --> 15:30.461
full of similar random
shreds of form and color.

15:32.498 --> 15:34.032
- This is me?

15:34.034 --> 15:35.533
- This is you.

15:37.202 --> 15:38.636
- I think it's always better not

15:38.638 --> 15:40.405
to arbitrarily stereotype a...

15:40.407 --> 15:43.441
- now, imagine a third
person in the museum.

15:43.443 --> 15:47.211
This is me, I'll look at the
pollock and the knockoff.

15:47.213 --> 15:50.048
I like the pollock for its
rhythm and originality.

15:50.050 --> 15:52.984
The knockoff has some
qualities I like,

15:52.986 --> 15:57.221
but it's half a century too
late, it's not original.

15:57.223 --> 16:01.225
And the longer I look at it,
the less I like it, why?

16:01.227 --> 16:03.962
Because I hear a little
voice inside me saying,

16:03.964 --> 16:07.198
Christ, my kid could paint this.

16:07.200 --> 16:09.434
And then I hear another voice
inside me saying, you don't

16:09.436 --> 16:13.237
have a kid, and you sound
like a tourist from Kentucky.

16:13.239 --> 16:15.406
You're not part
of the cool crowd.

16:15.408 --> 16:17.442
Other people get it,
not you though.

16:17.444 --> 16:20.278
And then I hear a
third voice in my head.

16:20.280 --> 16:22.113
No, Maya, it's
okay, you do get it,

16:22.115 --> 16:24.148
this really is a
mediocre painting.

16:24.150 --> 16:25.683
This really could've
been painted

16:25.685 --> 16:28.453
by a kid or even a cimputer.

16:30.255 --> 16:34.325
And then the people in
my head start arguing.

16:36.428 --> 16:38.329
- Are you saying
that my work is...

16:38.331 --> 16:40.331
- shit?

16:40.333 --> 16:44.469
Not quite, it's more like
chewed but undigested food.

16:46.171 --> 16:49.140
You're young,
there's hope for you.

16:57.249 --> 16:59.584
- In the back corner.

16:59.586 --> 17:00.651
That piece.

17:03.255 --> 17:06.023
Do you consider that good art?

17:06.026 --> 17:08.459
- That's a different
story, that's not paint.

17:08.461 --> 17:11.796
That's blood and
human brain matter.

17:11.798 --> 17:14.732
Isn't that terrible?

17:14.733 --> 17:18.336
But hey, you like cerebral art.

17:20.204 --> 17:22.073
She had lung cancer.

17:22.075 --> 17:24.308
That was her very last
painting, a perverse friend

17:24.310 --> 17:28.246
of mine bought it at an auction
for my birthday last year.

17:28.248 --> 17:31.249
- Hm, I think what you
and your museum-going self

17:31.251 --> 17:34.752
and your third self are missing
is a purposeful negation.

17:34.754 --> 17:37.455
This is apparently
counterintuitive.

17:37.457 --> 17:39.490
Okay.

17:39.492 --> 17:43.461
Purposefulness would seem to
have a positive component, yes?

17:43.463 --> 17:46.230
It positively is negation.

17:46.232 --> 17:49.133
But here's where I might
take issue with my own poem.

17:49.135 --> 17:51.702
Negation positively is negation,

17:51.704 --> 17:53.671
but only within
a conceptual system,

17:53.673 --> 17:57.442
the perhaps a priori system
of logical coherence.

17:57.444 --> 18:00.778
So what I'm doing
isn't really writing,

18:00.780 --> 18:04.449
but unwriting, you see?

18:04.451 --> 18:08.486
My negation has no positive
aspect, it simply isn't.

18:08.488 --> 18:10.288
- That's marvelous.

18:11.590 --> 18:13.524
- Thank you.

18:13.526 --> 18:16.227
- Did you really say my negation

18:16.229 --> 18:18.763
has no positive aspect to me?

18:18.765 --> 18:20.765
- Yes.

18:20.767 --> 18:25.169
Yeah, I think it's blatant
at the third line, apacity.

18:29.508 --> 18:31.476
- Do you have a wife?

18:33.445 --> 18:35.580
Or a girlfriend?

18:35.582 --> 18:37.782
- No, no, not exactly.

18:40.252 --> 18:41.819
- Are you able to carry out

18:41.821 --> 18:43.888
a difficult task from
beginning to end?

18:47.626 --> 18:51.329
It's no good, just get in
there and roughen it up.

18:51.331 --> 18:54.198
Cut was not finished,
you need to cut.

18:54.200 --> 18:56.167
Jesuit priest, what
were you thinking?

18:56.169 --> 18:57.902
It's actually in
very poor taste.

18:57.904 --> 18:59.770
- Just give me two
seconds, one, two, three...

18:59.772 --> 19:01.572
- why don't you go home

19:01.574 --> 19:03.741
and rewrite this and
come back, all right?

19:03.743 --> 19:05.510
- 21, 22.

19:05.512 --> 19:06.544
23, 24.

19:08.614 --> 19:09.647
25.

19:28.267 --> 19:29.800
- Everything is turning sharper.

19:32.638 --> 19:35.473
This is called being old.

19:38.644 --> 19:41.812
It turns sharp for a moment
before it turns blurry,

19:41.814 --> 19:46.551
everything does,
at a certain age.

19:49.488 --> 19:52.456
What is this species
of thought that is not

19:52.458 --> 19:59.230
a memory because it never
happened, but so memory-like?

19:59.232 --> 20:02.867
This thought of
myself at 40 maybe.

20:06.505 --> 20:07.939
Holding a baby.

20:20.485 --> 20:23.754
- There's such a strange green.

20:25.290 --> 20:27.725
Amphibian green in this view.

20:33.298 --> 20:36.634
- I like your sweater,
where'd you buy it?

20:39.504 --> 20:40.538
- This?

20:40.540 --> 20:41.739
- Mm.

20:44.276 --> 20:46.510
I don't, I don't remember.

20:48.280 --> 20:50.615
- Come on, don't tell
me you don't remember.

20:50.617 --> 20:52.950
That's a $400 sweater.

20:58.523 --> 21:01.592
- What kind of tree is this?

21:01.594 --> 21:03.394
- Horse Chestnut.

21:06.498 --> 21:07.531
- Chest nut.

21:09.501 --> 21:10.835
Chest...
- what?

21:10.837 --> 21:11.869
- What?

21:33.792 --> 21:36.661
You have a lot of glass.

21:38.430 --> 21:41.699
Are these all filled with glass?

21:43.735 --> 21:47.905
- I have a lot of
porcelain and stemware.

21:47.907 --> 21:49.507
- Stemware.

21:53.712 --> 21:56.847
Don't you like how all these

21:59.518 --> 22:01.085
anglo-Saxon words?

22:06.325 --> 22:08.592
- What's this?

22:08.594 --> 22:15.333
- That's when they
crush into each other.

22:16.535 --> 22:17.535
- Mm.

22:19.037 --> 22:22.073
- Chestnut, stemware.

22:23.809 --> 22:24.842
Foxfire.

22:26.545 --> 22:27.945
Footstool.

22:29.715 --> 22:31.115
- Outhouse.

22:36.521 --> 22:38.522
Rat hole.

22:38.524 --> 22:39.790
Hm, rat hole.

22:41.727 --> 22:42.927
- Mouthwash.

22:46.064 --> 22:48.132
Are you trying to
ingratiate yourself

22:48.134 --> 22:50.601
by playing language games?

22:52.437 --> 22:53.504
- What?

22:53.506 --> 22:54.506
No.

22:55.540 --> 22:56.540
I was...

22:56.542 --> 22:58.542
- it's okay.

22:58.544 --> 22:59.910
I like the word,

23:02.547 --> 23:04.548
Chestnut, hummingbird.

23:05.784 --> 23:07.518
Nightmare.

23:07.520 --> 23:09.086
- Of course you do.

23:09.088 --> 23:11.689
I know, you use it
as an adjective in...

23:11.691 --> 23:19.530
- please, don't quote me to me.

23:19.532 --> 23:20.564
- Okay.

23:24.736 --> 23:26.470
- Are you gay?

23:26.472 --> 23:27.471
- What?

23:27.473 --> 23:28.539
I was just, um.

23:30.809 --> 23:31.842
Rat hole.

23:47.559 --> 23:48.959
I know about porcelain.

23:48.961 --> 23:50.194
- What?

23:50.196 --> 23:52.563
- I know about the colors.

23:52.565 --> 23:57.067
- What does this mean,
you know about porcelain.

23:57.069 --> 23:59.537
- You probably
already know this,

23:59.539 --> 24:06.710
but there were these
chemists in Vincennes.

24:06.712 --> 24:11.549
These chemists they would
um, grind the colors.

24:11.551 --> 24:14.585
Then they started to experiment.

24:14.587 --> 24:20.558
I think they first had
some success with yellow.

24:20.560 --> 24:24.962
And then Lapis blue, like,

24:24.964 --> 24:28.632
Lapis blue like in
this piece here.

24:39.778 --> 24:42.580
You already know that.

24:42.582 --> 24:43.914
- Tell me.

24:47.152 --> 24:53.557
- Well, then, in 1750-something
they, they discovered green.

24:53.559 --> 24:56.160
And then blue Celeste.

24:56.162 --> 25:00.197
And then they discovered
the rose colors last.

25:01.933 --> 25:04.235
And then they killed
the king and queen

25:04.237 --> 25:07.571
and some of the
porcelain makers.

25:07.573 --> 25:10.274
Also I was in Chicago.

25:10.276 --> 25:16.547
And the porcelain collection
at the art institute,

25:16.549 --> 25:23.153
there's this plate,
or a serving platter,

25:23.155 --> 25:28.058
and on it is a
scene of what they

25:28.060 --> 25:34.732
call peasant life,
or pastoral life.

25:34.734 --> 25:40.538
It's a green and rose design,
and written around the rim

25:40.540 --> 25:45.776
the platter's rim,
pensent-ils Au raisin?

25:48.013 --> 25:50.814
- Are they
thinking about the grapes?

25:50.816 --> 25:52.616
- Yes.

25:52.618 --> 25:56.153
And I was with my friend
Marie at the time.

25:56.155 --> 26:01.091
And she saw the plate first
and translated the caption,

26:01.093 --> 26:05.029
and somehow I misheard
her, and I thought

26:05.031 --> 26:09.166
that she'd said are they
thinking about the Greeks?

26:09.168 --> 26:12.036
- Where are you going with this?

26:13.305 --> 26:15.873
- I'm not going anywhere, um.

26:18.577 --> 26:22.112
I just thought it was
beautiful that there

26:22.114 --> 26:25.349
could be some people on
a plate and then some other

26:25.351 --> 26:30.154
people eating off the
plate in the 18th century,

26:30.156 --> 26:33.357
just some people in the
18th century in France

26:33.359 --> 26:37.161
being asked by a plate if
maybe the people they were

26:37.163 --> 26:41.365
eating off of might be
thinking about the Greeks?

26:45.737 --> 26:47.771
- Are you responsible?

26:49.374 --> 26:51.041
- Responsible?

26:53.078 --> 26:55.913
- Do you pay
all your bills on time?

26:55.915 --> 26:59.316
Do you respond to emails?

26:59.318 --> 27:04.188
- I don't, I don't
really have that many bills.

27:04.190 --> 27:06.357
- Why are you living in Texas?

27:08.693 --> 27:10.961
- I don't know.

27:10.963 --> 27:13.697
My mother lives there.

27:13.699 --> 27:19.370
- Are you one of these,
codependent with your mother?

27:24.109 --> 27:27.177
- So this is silicon valley?

27:27.179 --> 27:31.749
- You're on top of the
south wall of silicon valley.

27:31.751 --> 27:35.119
- Kevin said you grow grapes?

27:36.888 --> 27:38.856
- Top acre.

27:38.858 --> 27:41.325
I don't do it, a company
does it and gives me a cut.

27:46.197 --> 27:48.866
- Why are you
going to kill yourself?

27:48.868 --> 27:53.404
You could write five more books
like the Monday metaphysics.

28:00.111 --> 28:04.381
- Is that your
favorite book of mine?

28:04.383 --> 28:05.783
- Maybe.

28:08.019 --> 28:15.392
- I was 31 when I wrote that.

28:15.394 --> 28:20.397
Do you think I'm
remotely similar

28:20.399 --> 28:24.401
to whatever woman
wrote that book?

28:25.938 --> 28:27.204
- Are those gunshots?

28:27.206 --> 28:30.074
- Ah, my wacky neighbor.

28:30.076 --> 28:34.411
Nothing alarming, target
practice, several times a week.

28:42.821 --> 28:45.122
- I think you're similar.

28:47.058 --> 28:52.196
I think that you
could write good books

28:52.198 --> 28:55.199
that aren't similar
to your old books.

28:57.235 --> 29:01.105
I don't think you should do it.

29:01.107 --> 29:03.907
- Are you here to
inherit my estate

29:03.909 --> 29:06.977
or to convince me
not to kill myself?

29:06.979 --> 29:08.746
- I don't know why I'm here.

29:11.816 --> 29:14.418
I just don't like the idea of

29:16.121 --> 29:18.889
death, just sitting there.

29:41.012 --> 29:42.212
- Mm.

29:54.993 --> 29:58.495
- What's this horseshit
people telling me?

30:02.000 --> 30:04.434
- You know, it's worked
for a few others.

30:04.436 --> 30:08.038
Plath, sexton, Woolf.

30:08.040 --> 30:12.309
It kind of jolts you into
a different category.

30:12.311 --> 30:16.446
- Blech, tastes like horseshit.

30:16.448 --> 30:18.482
Shit of a horse.

30:18.484 --> 30:23.220
- You know, priests don't
pay taxes, neither should we.

30:24.455 --> 30:25.989
- Who's we?

30:25.991 --> 30:27.057
- Us.

30:27.059 --> 30:28.592
Culture creators.

30:28.594 --> 30:32.429
Not you, you're a
tune-inner drop-outer.

30:32.431 --> 30:34.431
You're anti-culture.

30:34.433 --> 30:36.233
- Culture my yeast.

30:38.436 --> 30:39.937
- Exactly.

30:39.939 --> 30:42.406
- Fucking bacteria.

30:45.443 --> 30:47.845
Prepare your brain.

30:47.847 --> 30:52.416
I'm gonna teach you a new
paradox, crocodile paradox.

30:57.255 --> 31:01.391
A crocodile snatches a drag
queen from a riverbank.

31:01.393 --> 31:04.261
The queen mother is
there for some reason

31:04.263 --> 31:09.066
and pleads with the crocodile,
please don't eat my son.

31:09.068 --> 31:12.269
The croc says your majesty,
I will only not eat

31:12.271 --> 31:14.905
your daughter if you can
guess correctly whether

31:14.907 --> 31:19.042
or not I'm really gonna eat
your skinny-ass daughter.

31:19.044 --> 31:25.015
So there's no problem
if the mother guesses

31:25.017 --> 31:28.252
that the crocodile
won't eat her son.

31:28.254 --> 31:31.221
She's either right or wrong.

31:31.223 --> 31:35.459
But if she guesses he will
eat him, it's fucked up.

31:35.461 --> 31:41.465
- You told me this one years
ago, without the queens.

31:41.467 --> 31:43.233
Do you still nap?

31:46.471 --> 31:48.572
- I don't know.

31:48.574 --> 31:51.208
- I used to nap.

31:51.210 --> 31:53.911
If I got caught, by Ismail even,

31:53.913 --> 31:56.313
I'd lie and say
I wasn't sleeping.

32:00.919 --> 32:04.554
It's so undignified to be caught

32:04.556 --> 32:07.557
sleeping in the
middle of the day.

32:12.697 --> 32:15.399
- Yeah but if the
mother is right

32:15.401 --> 32:21.138
and the crocodile really
is gonna eat her son,

32:21.140 --> 32:23.440
then he has to return him.

32:29.447 --> 32:30.447
Fucked up.

32:33.985 --> 32:37.454
I wouldn't publicly
joke about suicide.

32:48.466 --> 32:50.300
What are you doing?

32:51.536 --> 32:53.603
- Sailing to Byzantium.

33:00.745 --> 33:03.981
Were you surprised I
invited you up here?

33:03.983 --> 33:06.450
- I don't know, do you
have a lot of guys applying?

33:06.452 --> 33:08.485
- Mm.

33:08.487 --> 33:11.455
But did you feel encouraged
after our first phone call?

33:11.457 --> 33:13.290
- Uh.

33:13.292 --> 33:16.059
I felt like you understand
that I'm an adult.

33:16.061 --> 33:19.463
Like you could tell
I don't fuck up.

33:19.465 --> 33:21.465
- I researched you
on the Internet.

33:21.467 --> 33:24.468
I read your little
squib in n plus one.

33:24.470 --> 33:26.336
Do you dislike Americans as much

33:26.338 --> 33:29.272
as you dislike the
Russians and the Israelis?

33:29.274 --> 33:32.376
- Well, I'm
egalitarian, you know?

33:32.378 --> 33:36.179
I think all cultures and
ethnicities should suffer

33:36.181 --> 33:40.484
the same amount of abuse,
Turks piss me off for example.

33:40.486 --> 33:42.185
- My ex is a Turk.

33:42.187 --> 33:43.653
- Yeah, I know.

33:43.655 --> 33:44.654
- You know?

33:44.656 --> 33:45.756
- Sure.

33:47.125 --> 33:48.492
- What about Chinese?

33:48.494 --> 33:53.463
- Um, bribery, dragon breath.

33:53.465 --> 33:55.465
Too many male people.

33:55.467 --> 33:56.467
- Swiss?

33:58.302 --> 34:02.773
- Smug, boring, white, mm.

34:04.542 --> 34:05.776
- Saudis?

34:05.778 --> 34:07.544
- Oh Saudis, yeah sure, Saudis,

34:07.546 --> 34:09.379
if a woman in Saudi Arabia wants

34:09.380 --> 34:11.648
to press charges,
she needs four witnesses.

34:11.650 --> 34:16.353
So as long as you gangbang
with only three friends.

34:16.355 --> 34:18.487
- Canadians.

34:18.489 --> 34:20.190
- Boring.

34:20.192 --> 34:21.391
- Mexicans?

34:26.496 --> 34:29.331
- I don't have a
problem with Mexicans.

34:29.333 --> 34:30.500
- Hm.

34:31.569 --> 34:33.303
- How am I doing?

34:35.206 --> 34:37.174
- Doing what?

34:37.176 --> 34:39.176
- Do you like me, do you
see me as executor material?

34:39.178 --> 34:43.746
- Possibly, what's your
familiarity with publishing?

34:43.748 --> 34:46.850
- I have an agent, she can't
get my book a deal, though.

34:46.851 --> 34:49.152
- Why not?

34:49.154 --> 34:51.455
- Probably it isn't very good.

34:51.456 --> 34:54.224
- Why not?

34:54.226 --> 34:58.195
- I don't know, maybe
the same reason you're...

34:58.197 --> 35:01.565
- perhaps it's
the opposite reason.

35:01.567 --> 35:03.633
- Yeah, maybe.

35:03.635 --> 35:09.506
But can I ask you a borderline
rude direct question?

35:09.508 --> 35:11.508
Are you sick?

35:11.510 --> 35:14.144
Do you have something terminal?

35:14.146 --> 35:17.581
- I wouldn't tell
you if I did, but no.

35:17.583 --> 35:19.349
- Well if I were terminal,

35:19.351 --> 35:21.718
I'd probably take
a bunch of heroin.

35:21.720 --> 35:22.719
You ever try it?

35:22.721 --> 35:23.854
- No.

35:23.856 --> 35:25.355
- I tried it.

35:25.357 --> 35:28.492
- What's heroin like?

35:28.494 --> 35:31.528
- Well it's not like 600
orgasms or whatever people say.

35:31.530 --> 35:33.196
It was pleasant.

35:33.198 --> 35:36.299
I vomited a little
and fell asleep.

35:36.301 --> 35:38.301
- I have no interest in heroin,

35:38.303 --> 35:40.437
but I wonder if your
description of the drug

35:40.439 --> 35:44.174
says more about you
than about the drug.

35:45.676 --> 35:47.244
- Yeah, maybe.

35:55.520 --> 35:59.322
- Would you describe
yourself as a sensual person?

35:59.324 --> 36:01.791
- I would describe
myself as cunning.

36:01.793 --> 36:03.927
- Mm.

36:03.929 --> 36:06.329
- Yeah, my brain is
fast enough to fake

36:06.331 --> 36:08.431
its way through any
sensual experience.

36:08.433 --> 36:11.535
And then, you know,
what's the difference?

36:11.537 --> 36:16.806
- The difference between
sensuality and fake sensuality?

36:16.808 --> 36:18.742
There's a tremendous difference.

36:18.744 --> 36:21.811
- Yeah, maybe, I'm
skeptical though.

36:21.813 --> 36:24.314
Like I can work
myself into a hell

36:24.316 --> 36:26.516
of a metaphysical
mood if I need to.

36:26.518 --> 36:29.419
Meanwhile, I have
friends who feel so much,

36:29.421 --> 36:34.524
who couldn't live their lives
without wine and amazing sex.

36:34.526 --> 36:36.293
They're miserable people.

36:36.295 --> 36:37.827
- They should kill themselves.

36:37.829 --> 36:39.663
- Yeah, except apparently
not one of them

36:39.665 --> 36:42.265
has written anything
good enough to justify...

36:42.267 --> 36:44.834
- you understood me then, what
I was saying a minute ago.

36:44.836 --> 36:46.536
You understand I'm
never being glib.

36:46.538 --> 36:47.771
- Yeah, yeah, I understood you.

36:47.773 --> 36:49.539
I get everything the first time.

36:49.541 --> 36:51.541
- Mm.

36:51.543 --> 36:53.543
- You don't have to play these
cat and mouse games with me,

36:53.545 --> 36:55.712
I mean you can, if you want
to, but you don't have to.

36:57.548 --> 37:00.550
- What am I up to, then?

37:00.552 --> 37:02.519
- Sure, I get why
you're doing this.

37:02.521 --> 37:04.487
- Hm.

37:04.489 --> 37:07.524
- Well you've got some terminal
disease and you probably

37:07.526 --> 37:09.559
like what you wrote 20
years ago but you don't like

37:09.561 --> 37:14.431
what you're writing now, and
probably other people agree.

37:14.433 --> 37:16.466
- Hm.

37:16.468 --> 37:18.468
- And so you figure if you go
off and pull a foster Wallace,

37:18.470 --> 37:21.538
you'll be doing your
good books a favor.

37:21.540 --> 37:25.275
And good books need all the
help they can get these days,

37:25.277 --> 37:27.444
especially when
they're competing with

37:27.446 --> 37:32.616
bad books like mine, you know
my agent's still pushing.

37:32.618 --> 37:35.452
It probably will happen, too.

37:37.455 --> 37:40.991
Well it's too bad for everyone.

37:40.993 --> 37:42.792
Cause my book will
take up space.

37:42.794 --> 37:44.361
A few thousand
people will read it

37:44.363 --> 37:46.563
and there are 10,000 of me.

37:46.565 --> 37:49.366
Yeah, so, I get it.

37:49.368 --> 37:53.436
Good writing is not
good enough anymore.

37:53.438 --> 37:57.374
You have to kill
yourself, or someone else.

37:57.376 --> 38:00.543
- Are you a
closet right-winger?

38:00.545 --> 38:02.512
- Well I wouldn't mind
selling this place

38:02.514 --> 38:06.683
and dividing the money between
myself and nine friends.

38:06.685 --> 38:08.551
- If I decide you're
right for this,

38:08.553 --> 38:11.354
I don't care what you
do with the property,

38:11.356 --> 38:15.592
but what about your politics,
especially regarding women?

38:17.895 --> 38:19.863
- Women.

38:19.865 --> 38:22.399
- Yes, I know. But
if I'm going to trust you

38:22.401 --> 38:26.970
with my afterlife, I need
to know that you believe

38:26.972 --> 38:31.574
in the very real mental
existence of women.

38:31.576 --> 38:34.577
- Do I look skeptical of
your mental existence?

38:34.579 --> 38:36.579
- Uh, yeah.

38:36.581 --> 38:40.350
- No no no, that's bullshit,
I don't have that problem.

38:40.352 --> 38:43.320
I don't have alienation issues.

38:43.322 --> 38:45.555
- Possibly that's
why you describe

38:45.557 --> 38:47.524
your own book as not very good.

38:47.526 --> 38:49.626
- No, come on.

38:49.628 --> 38:52.395
What do I have to do to prove
to you that I'm not an idiot?

38:57.034 --> 39:00.537
- You're done, you're
done, you're done.

39:03.542 --> 39:07.610
Oh no, not on the menu, not
on the menu, absolutely not!

39:07.612 --> 39:10.714
No, no!

39:18.857 --> 39:21.558
Ah!

39:26.698 --> 39:27.731
Ah!

39:34.905 --> 39:36.539
I'm going to kill you!

39:36.541 --> 39:39.109
I'm gonna, I'm gonna kill you!

39:39.111 --> 39:43.513
I'm going to kill you!

40:10.574 --> 40:12.509
I understand.

40:12.511 --> 40:14.577
You had to fuck me to prove...

40:14.579 --> 40:16.179
- it's no big
deal, I always fuck

40:16.181 --> 40:18.915
a woman after I go down on her.

40:22.019 --> 40:24.854
What should we do now?

40:24.856 --> 40:30.126
- Now we watch you get
off my land, you're out.

40:30.128 --> 40:33.563
You can't be my executor.

40:33.565 --> 40:35.165
- Do you have any alcohol?

40:35.167 --> 40:37.567
I'd really like a drink.

40:43.674 --> 40:46.576
- It's all over the kitchen.

40:46.578 --> 40:49.913
Go make me a drink,
you little bitch.

41:51.208 --> 41:53.243
You know, I know
at least 10 women

41:53.245 --> 41:56.613
who'd call what
you just did rape.

42:00.584 --> 42:05.154
- I'm glad you aren't
one of those 10 women.

42:09.059 --> 42:10.994
- What are you
reading right now?

42:14.198 --> 42:17.000
- You know not much, actually.

42:18.869 --> 42:22.605
I find myself without a
lot of Patience in my 30s.

42:22.607 --> 42:24.874
You know, it's weird.

42:24.876 --> 42:27.977
You'd think I'd
have more Patience.

42:33.017 --> 42:35.652
- You're uglier than
I first realized.

42:35.654 --> 42:38.221
- Yeah, well my phone
and my computer have

42:38.223 --> 42:41.991
killed off my ability to
be beautiful and read.

42:41.993 --> 42:44.861
I read the whole mess in my 20s.

42:46.597 --> 42:50.099
That was the end of reading.

42:50.101 --> 42:54.070
Now I just write and
skim and write and skim.

42:56.707 --> 42:59.242
I read your novel in my 20s.

43:00.844 --> 43:04.247
I haven't read your poetry.

43:04.249 --> 43:08.618
- You should, you might
learn some fucking grace.

43:08.620 --> 43:11.220
The three books
I wrote in my 30s.

43:11.222 --> 43:15.858
Those are what
sycophants call genius.

43:15.860 --> 43:17.594
One, two, three.

43:20.230 --> 43:23.766
Like little neutron stars.

43:23.768 --> 43:28.171
- So your own mind managed
to impress you, yeah?

43:29.607 --> 43:32.041
- Not now, the light's gone out.

43:37.881 --> 43:41.618
But in my 30s, yes,
my mind was very good.

43:42.853 --> 43:45.188
I felt it, then, I loved it.

43:48.626 --> 43:55.965
It was like a set of
strings, all intertwined.

43:55.967 --> 44:00.403
But not tangled, not
tangled like necklaces.

44:00.405 --> 44:05.174
But like a 10 or 11

44:05.176 --> 44:08.177
dimensional hammered dulcimer.

44:13.083 --> 44:16.285
Then in my 30s.

44:18.155 --> 44:21.124
- I'll, I'll make you a deal.

44:24.228 --> 44:27.063
You make me your
heir and executor,

44:27.065 --> 44:30.433
and I'll read all your books
and write a hagiography

44:30.435 --> 44:33.236
of you and spend my
30s telling everyone

44:33.238 --> 44:37.240
how beautiful a
dulcimer you were.

44:37.242 --> 44:41.077
- You can't be my executor,
you're out, I told you already.

44:41.079 --> 44:42.145
- Yeah?

44:44.882 --> 44:46.449
- Out.

44:46.451 --> 44:47.451
Out.

44:49.453 --> 44:52.722
- Let me finish my drink.

44:52.724 --> 44:57.293
- Yeah, you can finish your
drink, that's the law, you know.

44:59.196 --> 45:04.200
The laws of hospitality
are older than poetry even.

45:09.339 --> 45:10.373
Cheers.

45:17.748 --> 45:22.118
- So um, when could I come back?

45:26.724 --> 45:29.192
- Let me check my calendar.

45:38.368 --> 45:39.936
- I uh,

45:41.438 --> 45:44.440
I play the violin, you know.

45:49.179 --> 45:52.381
- Next week, next Thursday.

45:54.252 --> 45:57.754
That's the neighbor, nothing.

45:57.756 --> 45:59.455
- I'm not free on Thursdays.

45:59.457 --> 46:03.426
I wait tables, I'm
a fucking plebe.

46:03.428 --> 46:07.764
- You're free on Thursdays
if you want to come back.

46:07.766 --> 46:11.300
- Okay, see you next Thursday.

46:23.514 --> 46:26.415
- Tomfiddlery, clusterfuckery.

46:31.155 --> 46:34.290
Clusterfuck I'm going where,

46:34.292 --> 46:36.926
I don't know, I don't care.

46:39.062 --> 46:40.797
Clusterfuck.

46:42.466 --> 46:46.469
- You don't even
live near other people.

46:46.471 --> 46:49.872
- I live near you
and all your junk.

46:53.243 --> 47:00.116
If I, I'd start over,
I'd go live in Istanbul.

47:01.485 --> 47:04.320
Maybe paint some crazy shit.

47:06.456 --> 47:09.992
Isn't that awful
when a writer says,

47:12.462 --> 47:15.131
maybe I'll take up painting?

47:16.333 --> 47:20.236
- You're just fucked up, Maya.

47:20.238 --> 47:23.472
You're behaving like
a lonely person.

47:25.309 --> 47:28.945
You need to drop acid
and make new friends.

47:28.947 --> 47:31.047
Why don't you go to burning man?

47:31.049 --> 47:33.449
- A person can live
right on the bosphorus.

47:33.451 --> 47:36.219
It's still kind of
cheap there, you know.

47:36.221 --> 47:40.323
With my grapes and my
land and what it's worth.

47:44.228 --> 47:46.295
Even nicer places
along the water

47:46.297 --> 47:49.298
on the Asian side, for decades.

47:51.468 --> 47:56.138
Unless Turkey blows up in civil
war by the end of the year.

48:16.293 --> 48:19.095
- Do you miss Ismail?

48:27.604 --> 48:29.572
What happened to your pact?

48:31.475 --> 48:33.175
- What pact?

48:33.177 --> 48:34.477
- The one where you get back

48:34.479 --> 48:36.512
together when he turned 60.

48:38.515 --> 48:40.483
- You remember that?

48:41.585 --> 48:43.286
Hm.

48:43.288 --> 48:45.488
Pacts are for pachyderms.

49:00.304 --> 49:04.240
You smell pretty
good for someone who

49:04.242 --> 49:07.643
- outdoor showers get you just
as clean as indoor.

49:13.951 --> 49:17.019
It's okay to admit
when you miss someone.

49:19.556 --> 49:21.590
- I don't miss Ismail.

49:24.494 --> 49:26.562
I do miss Turkish men, though.

49:29.499 --> 49:32.335
I'd like to meet
another Turkish man.

49:58.462 --> 50:01.197
Look, at our age
one can either live

50:01.199 --> 50:03.532
in a healthy state of denial

50:07.537 --> 50:10.673
or an unhealthy
state of mortality.

50:12.642 --> 50:17.313
I live in the mortality,
and so, you know, for me,

50:17.315 --> 50:22.685
everything is starting to
have this ghostly profundity,

50:25.489 --> 50:29.525
exactly because nothing
is, in fact, profound.

50:31.528 --> 50:33.729
And there are no ghosts.

50:40.337 --> 50:43.472
And because I have
no one at all.

50:51.248 --> 50:55.651
The only thing
that matters to me

50:55.653 --> 50:58.521
are the books I wrote years ago.

51:00.057 --> 51:02.425
That's it, that's it.

51:04.327 --> 51:06.529
That's all I care about.

51:43.800 --> 51:45.568
- What is this?

51:45.570 --> 51:48.104
- My boat.

51:48.106 --> 51:52.141
All this junk was here
when I bought the land.

51:53.577 --> 51:56.545
- I like your boat very much.

52:07.557 --> 52:14.263
- You know there's another
boy, man, whatever you all are.

52:14.265 --> 52:18.367
His writing is not
as good as yours.

52:18.369 --> 52:20.636
But there is competition.

52:22.706 --> 52:23.739
Paul.

52:26.743 --> 52:29.545
He's not like you at all.

52:29.547 --> 52:31.547
He's not a mama's boy.

52:32.782 --> 52:35.484
Would you like to meet him?

52:35.486 --> 52:37.319
- Meet him here?

52:38.455 --> 52:40.523
- Yeah, at my house.

52:40.525 --> 52:42.458
He comes twice a week.

52:42.460 --> 52:43.692
- No.

52:43.694 --> 52:45.928
I mean, um, no, I'd prefer not.

52:47.631 --> 52:50.633
- That might just be too bad.

53:11.688 --> 53:13.822
- Are you angry at me?

53:13.824 --> 53:15.224
- No.

53:29.673 --> 53:32.975
- I'm not obsessed
with my mother.

53:32.977 --> 53:35.744
I don't live in Texas
because of my mother.

53:35.746 --> 53:37.680
- Oh, no?

53:37.682 --> 53:42.551
- No, my mother was
terrible, when I was little.

53:42.553 --> 53:46.555
- Oh yeah, what terrible
things did she do?

53:48.291 --> 53:50.759
- She slept with men.

53:52.796 --> 53:55.965
- That sounds just awful.

53:55.967 --> 53:57.766
- Hundreds of them.

53:57.768 --> 53:59.902
- Was she a prostitute?

54:01.571 --> 54:02.638
Was she?

54:02.640 --> 54:05.874
- No.

54:05.876 --> 54:10.412
- Well, I can't have a man
taking over my posthumous rep

54:10.414 --> 54:14.350
if he doesn't like mean
old libidinous women.

54:14.352 --> 54:20.556
- My mother wasn't mean or old

54:20.558 --> 54:22.458
or even so libidinous.

54:22.460 --> 54:26.895
She just, she was a person
with terrible values.

54:29.566 --> 54:35.471
She wanted to be a news
anchor on television.

54:35.473 --> 54:37.373
- And?

54:37.375 --> 54:41.977
- And she tried and
tried, and nobody gave

54:41.979 --> 54:45.014
her what she wanted,
but they just kept

54:45.016 --> 54:49.752
teasing her and
having sex with her.

54:51.421 --> 54:54.423
And they were all
horrible people.

54:57.327 --> 55:00.996
- And now you're into
poetry and porcelain.

55:04.567 --> 55:06.068
Poor little flower.

55:09.339 --> 55:11.573
I don't feel bad for you.

55:17.080 --> 55:18.781
It's getting dark.

55:19.983 --> 55:22.017
Go back to your hotel.

55:29.893 --> 55:33.762
Uh, maybe not idiotic,
mediocre is the word.

55:35.498 --> 55:41.003
His, um, soft-core
dialogue he writes,

55:41.005 --> 55:45.474
this pseudo-red-light-district
shit.

55:47.410 --> 55:50.612
I don't like books
by men like that.

55:52.549 --> 55:54.883
- Yeah, well,
you're missing out.

56:42.399 --> 56:47.703
- Hello, Ismail,
how's the weather in my head?

56:49.005 --> 56:51.774
How's the weather in Byzantium?

56:53.610 --> 56:55.611
You old Trojan rooster.

57:05.121 --> 57:06.622
- I don't want to
hear the criticism.

57:06.624 --> 57:08.123
- That was luck.

57:08.125 --> 57:09.191
- We can just let
silence continue.

57:09.193 --> 57:10.659
- Just read it, Ansel.

57:15.632 --> 57:19.868
I think I've had some water
in my ear for a few weeks.

57:21.938 --> 57:23.705
Read it to me.

57:23.707 --> 57:28.644
- Fell when the wax
melted, fell in through

57:28.646 --> 57:32.481
an aneurysm in a thought
of wall into a grand

57:32.483 --> 57:36.618
reception hall like in
an 18th century hotel.

57:36.620 --> 57:40.556
And there stood you in
schism-blue eyeflooding

57:40.558 --> 57:46.595
floor length gown, and all your
books and things around you,

57:46.597 --> 57:50.065
you had given them
them to wingless me,

57:51.501 --> 57:53.902
who wrote this note to you.

57:55.738 --> 57:59.141
It said, don't hurt yourself.

57:59.143 --> 58:02.478
I'm asking you, it said,

58:02.480 --> 58:07.549
it said I fell in through
a rip in the paper.

58:18.194 --> 58:22.164
- You're a sweet boy,
Ansel, thank you.

58:25.201 --> 58:28.237
One almost imagines you're
the kind of reactionary

58:28.239 --> 58:30.606
who writes because
he felt something,

58:30.608 --> 58:32.808
and not just because he
wants to be published.

58:35.545 --> 58:37.613
There might be an unpublished

58:37.615 --> 58:39.882
novel here somewhere
on the property.

58:42.285 --> 58:45.187
Given the corporate
takeover of publishing,

58:45.189 --> 58:50.626
I think a Maya Dardel novel's

58:50.628 --> 58:56.198
worth an advance of maybe
$100,000 if I'm living,

58:56.200 --> 59:00.035
but I think a million
maybe if I'm dead.

59:00.037 --> 59:03.639
- That's not why I'm here.

59:03.641 --> 59:05.807
- Did I hurt
your feelings again?

59:08.278 --> 59:10.879
Why are you here, dear boy?

59:18.288 --> 59:21.823
- Because it, it
shouldn't be anyone else,

59:21.825 --> 59:23.759
if you have to do it.

59:25.628 --> 59:26.728
- Why?

59:29.566 --> 59:33.635
- Because I
understand your work.

59:33.637 --> 59:41.276
I understand it, I can read
it in its six or seven layers

59:41.278 --> 59:45.847
or matrices or whatever
you think of them as.

59:45.849 --> 59:48.350
- Them?

59:48.352 --> 59:53.655
- The layers, the combining
and harmonic themes

59:53.657 --> 59:57.993
and sounds and senses, and you
know what I'm talking about.

01:00:00.063 --> 01:00:02.197
- You're making
poetry sound like

01:00:02.199 --> 01:00:05.067
some rare form of luminous math.

01:00:06.669 --> 01:00:09.638
- Well, isn't it, kind of?

01:00:11.040 --> 01:00:13.008
- Maybe it is.

01:00:13.010 --> 01:00:18.647
You know this poem, despite
that it's written to me,

01:00:18.649 --> 01:00:21.650
is really quite impressive.

01:00:21.652 --> 01:00:26.655
Um, but there are some
risks in it, though, right?

01:00:26.657 --> 01:00:28.323
- What risks?

01:00:28.325 --> 01:00:32.094
- Well, schism-blue for example.

01:00:34.097 --> 01:00:36.898
It's interesting to
imagine the shade

01:00:36.900 --> 01:00:39.868
of blue that is
the schism shade.

01:00:42.705 --> 01:00:46.141
The blue of divorce,
of mental breakdown,

01:00:46.143 --> 01:00:48.143
of civil war uniforms.

01:00:49.379 --> 01:00:51.847
Yeah, yes, and it's interesting

01:00:51.849 --> 01:00:54.249
to imagine in the
other direction,

01:00:54.251 --> 01:00:57.653
a schism that is
um, blue in quality.

01:00:59.789 --> 01:01:02.391
But there's a certain

01:01:02.393 --> 01:01:07.262
fetishism in just
plunking it in the poem.

01:01:07.264 --> 01:01:11.299
Um, it, uh, it shows
your hand a little.

01:01:11.301 --> 01:01:13.268
- I don't mind showing my hand.

01:01:13.270 --> 01:01:15.037
- Well, you should.

01:01:15.039 --> 01:01:16.972
- Plus it rhymes, plus
it adds to the Icarus

01:01:16.974 --> 01:01:20.275
theme so that's four
uh, layers there and...

01:01:20.277 --> 01:01:22.277
- yes, your poetry is layered.

01:01:22.279 --> 01:01:24.680
As I said, it's
impressive, more impressive

01:01:24.682 --> 01:01:29.351
than my way of talking
about it probably implies.

01:01:29.353 --> 01:01:32.287
But that's not the point.

01:01:32.289 --> 01:01:37.292
Your schism-blue is
a little too obviously

01:01:37.294 --> 01:01:40.462
infatuated with its
own layered prettiness.

01:01:40.464 --> 01:01:46.201
- Oh well, that only
matters right now, I mean,

01:01:48.404 --> 01:01:55.477
when I'm dead, if people
read my books, they'll,

01:01:55.479 --> 01:01:59.281
if people read books when
I'm dead, they'll um,

01:01:59.283 --> 01:02:01.483
think of my schism-blue
eye flooding floor

01:02:01.485 --> 01:02:08.890
the way they look at Joyce's
smoke blue mobile eyes.

01:02:10.760 --> 01:02:17.099
Or hart crane's rip-tooth
of the sky's acetylene.

01:02:19.769 --> 01:02:27.275
- Sure, sure, death beautifies
even the ugliest vanity.

01:02:27.277 --> 01:02:32.147
Ever looked at photographs
of contemporary authors,

01:02:32.149 --> 01:02:35.350
pompous, and have you
ever thought about

01:02:35.352 --> 01:02:38.754
how romantic they will
seem in 100 years?

01:02:44.494 --> 01:02:49.097
We're soon to be
extinct, I think.

01:02:49.099 --> 01:02:51.867
We're like the dodos
and the aristocrats.

01:03:25.168 --> 01:03:27.035
So this is my surprise?

01:03:27.037 --> 01:03:28.904
Very impressive.

01:04:01.571 --> 01:04:04.139
I don't eat mushrooms
from my driveway.

01:04:04.141 --> 01:04:06.141
- Why not?

01:04:06.143 --> 01:04:09.244
If I'm wrong, and there's
only a 1% chance that I am,

01:04:09.246 --> 01:04:13.515
then um, the worst thing that'll
happen is that we'll die.

01:04:15.051 --> 01:04:16.918
You want that.

01:04:16.920 --> 01:04:20.021
- Yeah, but Ansel, I
don't want to die in pain,

01:04:20.023 --> 01:04:23.325
covered with my own
vomit and yours.

01:04:23.327 --> 01:04:25.627
- These are Chanterelles.

01:04:27.330 --> 01:04:30.332
I'd like to make you an omelet.

01:04:30.334 --> 01:04:34.369
Do you have any um, any
interesting cheeses?

01:04:38.140 --> 01:04:39.140
Hm.

01:04:43.546 --> 01:04:44.546
Garlic?

01:04:46.349 --> 01:04:49.351
- I have some strange
Israeli frozen garlic.

01:04:49.353 --> 01:04:51.486
Um, it's really from,
it's probably actually

01:04:51.488 --> 01:04:56.291
from China and covered
with pulverized horse.

01:04:56.293 --> 01:04:58.894
I'm gonna put this
for 30 minutes.

01:05:01.031 --> 01:05:05.667
If we're alive when it
goes off, hurrah for us.

01:05:36.565 --> 01:05:40.168
Tell me more about
this harlot mother.

01:05:40.170 --> 01:05:41.603
- Mine?

01:05:41.605 --> 01:05:44.506
- Yes, yours.

01:05:44.508 --> 01:05:48.576
Mine was a simpleton
with no desires.

01:05:48.578 --> 01:05:54.049
I'm interested in ambitious
women, even shallow ones.

01:05:54.051 --> 01:05:56.518
- My mother's never honest.

01:05:56.520 --> 01:05:58.720
She plays games.

01:05:58.722 --> 01:06:01.690
- Give me an example.

01:06:01.692 --> 01:06:03.558
- I don't know,
she doesn't realize

01:06:03.560 --> 01:06:05.527
she's playing mind games.

01:06:05.529 --> 01:06:08.229
And then I'm forced
to play them with her.

01:06:08.231 --> 01:06:11.333
- Like you're
forced to play with me?

01:06:11.335 --> 01:06:15.537
- No, you're very aware
of the games you play.

01:06:15.539 --> 01:06:17.038
- Is she my age?

01:06:17.040 --> 01:06:19.341
- Slightly older.

01:06:19.343 --> 01:06:21.276
- How does she mindfuck you?

01:06:21.278 --> 01:06:22.677
Give me examples.

01:06:25.514 --> 01:06:28.350
- She claimed that she
didn't get any sleep

01:06:28.352 --> 01:06:31.419
at all because
she had this dream

01:06:31.421 --> 01:06:35.523
that she and my sister
and I were all at some...

01:06:35.525 --> 01:06:36.725
- you have a sister?

01:06:36.727 --> 01:06:38.626
- Zoe, yes.

01:06:38.628 --> 01:06:40.695
- Mm.

01:06:40.697 --> 01:06:44.532
- And in this dream that
she claims that she had,

01:06:44.534 --> 01:06:49.304
Karl, my father's brother,
knocked me over the head with

01:06:49.306 --> 01:06:52.540
a microphone stand and told
me that my father wasn't my

01:06:52.542 --> 01:06:57.178
real father, but that my father
was my sister's real father.

01:06:57.180 --> 01:06:58.546
- Zoe's older?

01:06:58.548 --> 01:07:00.148
- She's younger.

01:07:02.184 --> 01:07:06.354
Anyway she called me to
tell me she dreamed that.

01:07:06.356 --> 01:07:08.623
- What did you say?

01:07:11.560 --> 01:07:16.031
- I said I don't know if I find
people's dreams interesting,

01:07:16.033 --> 01:07:18.566
but I certainly find
people's interest

01:07:18.568 --> 01:07:20.535
in their own dreams interesting.

01:07:20.537 --> 01:07:22.270
- Mm.

01:07:22.272 --> 01:07:24.372
Do you think you're
your father's son?

01:07:24.374 --> 01:07:28.610
- I do, I think my mother had
a bad dream and couldn't help

01:07:28.612 --> 01:07:34.349
but jab me with it, just to
put a little needle in me.

01:07:34.351 --> 01:07:37.786
- Hm, maybe
she wanted attention.

01:07:40.356 --> 01:07:42.490
- She always wants attention.

01:07:42.492 --> 01:07:46.127
- Were you nice to her about it?

01:07:49.565 --> 01:07:51.566
- I was nice, I guess.

01:07:51.568 --> 01:07:52.568
- Mm.

01:08:01.343 --> 01:08:03.111
We have 15 minutes.

01:08:05.614 --> 01:08:07.682
'Til the toxin takes effect.

01:08:09.351 --> 01:08:11.352
Do you know the first signs

01:08:11.354 --> 01:08:15.090
of mushroom poisoning
in a pregnant woman?

01:08:17.560 --> 01:08:19.661
Her breasts shoot milk.

01:08:22.398 --> 01:08:26.568
I read this in a novel,
so it must be true.

01:08:26.569 --> 01:08:28.536
Your body confuses the toxin

01:08:28.537 --> 01:08:31.573
arresting your
system for a baby.

01:08:33.309 --> 01:08:34.576
I like that.

01:08:40.483 --> 01:08:43.685
Ever heard of ovarian
insufficiency?

01:08:46.388 --> 01:08:49.256
There's material for a bad poet.

01:08:55.363 --> 01:08:57.332
Hm, go get the phone.

01:09:01.437 --> 01:09:03.371
I'd ask you to use your own

01:09:03.372 --> 01:09:06.474
but reception is
so weak up here.

01:09:09.145 --> 01:09:11.712
- Who are you calling?

01:09:11.715 --> 01:09:13.814
- Your mother, of course.

01:09:13.817 --> 01:09:15.783
- What, why?

01:09:15.785 --> 01:09:18.386
- In these last minutes of
your life, it's important

01:09:18.388 --> 01:09:22.524
to tell those close to you what
you really think about them.

01:09:22.526 --> 01:09:24.259
Go ahead.

01:09:26.462 --> 01:09:28.630
Tell your mother
what you told me,

01:09:28.631 --> 01:09:32.700
that she's unsophisticated
and manipulative.

01:09:35.604 --> 01:09:38.406
You want my estate, don't you?

01:09:38.408 --> 01:09:40.408
- Yes, just stop asking that.

01:09:40.410 --> 01:09:42.777
- How much do you want it?

01:09:45.615 --> 01:09:47.215
- I think...

01:09:50.586 --> 01:09:52.787
I could live here with

01:09:52.788 --> 01:09:54.789
and take care of you,

01:09:54.791 --> 01:09:58.393
whether you were dead or alive.

01:09:58.395 --> 01:10:01.362
- Go ahead, take care of me.

01:10:01.364 --> 01:10:05.600
Show me you'll do perverse
things out of loyalty to me.

01:10:14.577 --> 01:10:16.411
We don't have all day.

01:10:30.659 --> 01:10:32.427
- I made a mistake.

01:10:42.605 --> 01:10:43.938
I don't think she's gonna...

01:10:43.940 --> 01:10:46.541
- hello?

01:10:46.543 --> 01:10:48.343
- Hi.

01:10:49.346 --> 01:10:50.945
No, it's me.

01:10:52.716 --> 01:10:55.416
No, I just wanted to
tell you something.

01:10:58.855 --> 01:11:01.422
I want to tell you something.

01:11:01.424 --> 01:11:04.692
No. No, no, you
don't have a choice.

01:11:04.694 --> 01:11:07.662
The city makes you pay them.

01:11:09.432 --> 01:11:11.032
No, I want to tell
you something.

01:11:12.902 --> 01:11:14.936
Will you let me speak?

01:11:19.008 --> 01:11:21.042
You're a solipsist.

01:11:21.044 --> 01:11:22.644
- What?

01:11:22.646 --> 01:11:25.013
- A solipsist.

01:11:25.015 --> 01:11:30.418
You don't know anything
about anybody but you.

01:11:30.420 --> 01:11:33.421
You don't know why
people do things.

01:11:33.423 --> 01:11:37.625
No, you think that people either
are against you or obsessed

01:11:37.627 --> 01:11:41.429
with you, there's, you don't
really see any grayer areas.

01:11:42.999 --> 01:11:44.799
No, you don't know
how you're perceived.

01:11:46.870 --> 01:11:51.439
Please, please don't cry.

01:11:53.642 --> 01:11:57.312
- Tell her those news
anchor barbarians,

01:11:57.314 --> 01:11:59.447
that they used her for sex.

01:12:01.451 --> 01:12:04.452
And your sister's
name is Zoe, right?

01:12:06.656 --> 01:12:08.656
Tell her Zoe hates her.

01:12:12.462 --> 01:12:14.462
Zoe hates her.

01:12:14.464 --> 01:12:16.631
- Zoe hates you.

01:12:20.002 --> 01:12:22.770
She hung up before I said that.

01:12:33.115 --> 01:12:35.616
- Thank you, you did well.

01:12:39.822 --> 01:12:41.622
Go clean your face.

01:13:16.892 --> 01:13:19.627
Are you really
walking your rat dogs

01:13:19.629 --> 01:13:23.464
or did you come over
here to check on me?

01:13:26.635 --> 01:13:29.103
- Which boy was that?

01:13:29.105 --> 01:13:32.039
- That's Paul.

01:13:32.041 --> 01:13:34.542
- Hmm, what if
somebody called the cops?

01:13:34.544 --> 01:13:36.644
You ever thought about that?

01:13:36.646 --> 01:13:39.447
Someone called the cops
on me a buncha times.

01:13:39.449 --> 01:13:40.915
- The police already called.

01:13:40.917 --> 01:13:42.650
- Oh, yeah?

01:13:42.652 --> 01:13:45.453
- Several weeks ago.

01:13:45.455 --> 01:13:49.090
I told them I was proud of
them for listening to NPR.

01:13:49.092 --> 01:13:55.530
Ah, this social worker
cop, his name's Alfonso.

01:13:55.532 --> 01:13:57.832
Do you like the name Alfonso?

01:13:57.834 --> 01:14:02.603
Could you unsarcastically
fuck a man with that name?

01:14:04.106 --> 01:14:06.808
- I've never sarcastically
fucked anyone.

01:14:06.810 --> 01:14:08.776
That's your department.

01:14:08.778 --> 01:14:10.912
- I told him thanks for your
interest in contemporary

01:14:10.914 --> 01:14:13.614
literature and no, I'm
not a threat to myself

01:14:13.616 --> 01:14:17.985
but merely someone who
enjoys speaking in metaphors.

01:14:21.457 --> 01:14:22.723
- Oh god.

01:14:22.725 --> 01:14:24.459
Go already, squat.

01:14:24.461 --> 01:14:26.461
- And I told them if
they started listening

01:14:26.463 --> 01:14:28.463
to other interviews with
writers, they would have

01:14:28.465 --> 01:14:33.668
to worry, we're all
threats to our own person.

01:14:33.670 --> 01:14:37.138
You're more of a threat
to others, I'd say.

01:14:37.140 --> 01:14:39.740
- I'm going to drop
acid on Sunday.

01:14:44.213 --> 01:14:46.881
- This is a great idea.

01:14:46.883 --> 01:14:50.218
I need your help with something.

01:14:50.220 --> 01:14:53.721
- I'm pretty much
immune to it, these days.

01:15:02.264 --> 01:15:06.667
- I need you to know
that I'm utterly sane.

01:15:06.669 --> 01:15:07.802
Even if I go.

01:15:14.009 --> 01:15:16.043
- No, no, no.

01:15:25.287 --> 01:15:30.992
- Yes, dear, it's um,
it's time to sail away.

01:15:33.929 --> 01:15:37.665
- You do, and I'll
piss on your grave.

01:15:37.667 --> 01:15:41.669
- Well, as Ansel says,
I'm a cruel person.

01:15:42.938 --> 01:15:46.274
- You better not be.

01:15:46.276 --> 01:15:48.276
- However I'm perfectly sane.

01:15:48.278 --> 01:15:51.646
Whatever I do, I do
out of pure will, okay?

01:15:54.883 --> 01:15:56.150
Not hysteria.

01:16:53.642 --> 01:16:55.276
- What you did yesterday was...

01:16:55.278 --> 01:16:57.712
- I know, I know.

01:16:59.715 --> 01:17:02.850
- Why did you make me do that?

01:17:02.852 --> 01:17:04.719
- I, I don't know.

01:17:07.923 --> 01:17:10.691
I get carried away by power.

01:17:10.693 --> 01:17:13.260
I really like it.

01:17:13.262 --> 01:17:17.298
I think maybe I haven't
had enough of it.

01:17:17.300 --> 01:17:22.303
People don't like a woman with
too much power.

01:17:22.305 --> 01:17:24.705
I'd run for president except

01:17:24.707 --> 01:17:29.310
a monstrous woman
isn't sympathetic.

01:17:29.312 --> 01:17:34.248
Monstrous men do get elected,
and I wasn't born here.

01:17:37.119 --> 01:17:39.720
- You should
go back to teaching.

01:17:39.722 --> 01:17:42.790
- Except I don't like
my power so defined,

01:17:42.792 --> 01:17:47.194
institutionally circumscribed,
I like raw power.

01:17:58.240 --> 01:18:00.107
- That sounds like something

01:18:00.109 --> 01:18:02.309
that someone very
young would say.

01:18:02.311 --> 01:18:05.813
- You're right, of course.

01:18:05.815 --> 01:18:09.717
That's what happens,
whatever I say sounds false.

01:18:09.719 --> 01:18:15.322
Talking about death is a
lot like dividing by zero,

01:18:15.324 --> 01:18:19.860
you know, because it generates
these error messages.

01:18:21.196 --> 01:18:22.730
- I know, my father...

01:18:22.732 --> 01:18:24.699
- and it's not even a romantic

01:18:24.701 --> 01:18:26.734
illusion about
posterity, either.

01:18:26.736 --> 01:18:30.004
It's a sober judgment
of the very meager value

01:18:30.006 --> 01:18:32.773
of my books weighed
against the even

01:18:32.775 --> 01:18:37.211
more obscenely meager
value of my person.

01:18:46.755 --> 01:18:48.723
Toughen up, Ansel.

01:18:48.725 --> 01:18:52.760
The things I do are merely
mildly horrible and cruel.

01:18:52.762 --> 01:18:56.297
I'm actually maybe fond of you.

01:18:56.299 --> 01:18:58.099
And furthermore your mother's

01:18:58.101 --> 01:19:00.401
probably lovely,
sympathetic even.

01:19:00.403 --> 01:19:03.738
You're probably dead
wrong about her.

01:19:03.740 --> 01:19:08.109
Everyone should hear how
miserably misperceived they are.

01:19:09.878 --> 01:19:11.746
Communication would be
less of a Clusterfuck

01:19:11.748 --> 01:19:15.950
if everyone knew how much
of a Clusterfuck it is.

01:20:04.900 --> 01:20:06.534
- Hello?

01:20:06.536 --> 01:20:08.102
- Ansel?

01:20:08.104 --> 01:20:09.970
- Hi.

01:20:09.972 --> 01:20:11.972
- You're coming tomorrow.

01:20:11.974 --> 01:20:12.973
- Yes.

01:20:12.975 --> 01:20:14.341
- Good.

01:20:15.844 --> 01:20:18.112
I have something for you.

01:20:43.338 --> 01:20:46.540
One can look at it
however many ways.

01:20:48.510 --> 01:20:50.444
One's time alone.

01:20:57.252 --> 01:21:01.388
A succession of
isolated instances,

01:21:01.390 --> 01:21:04.191
or 10 years in a row of 10.

01:21:20.976 --> 01:21:22.576
One 10 year moment,

01:21:25.347 --> 01:21:29.083
or 10,000 ax heads hitting wood,

01:21:29.085 --> 01:21:32.152
or whetstones hitting ax heads,

01:21:32.154 --> 01:21:36.557
or my heart beating
half a billion times.

01:21:43.031 --> 01:21:46.000
Then there's the speed of light.

01:22:27.575 --> 01:22:31.445
- Fuck.

01:22:33.315 --> 01:22:36.317
- Fuck.

01:22:36.319 --> 01:22:37.518
- Fuck.

01:22:37.520 --> 01:22:38.585
- Fuck.

01:22:39.588 --> 01:22:41.288
Fuck.

01:22:42.591 --> 01:22:44.658
Fuck.

01:22:44.660 --> 01:22:49.596
- I'm saying, no, I'm saying
that everyone is a hypocrite,

01:22:49.598 --> 01:22:53.567
is, you know, especially
someone who says she isn't.

01:22:53.569 --> 01:22:56.370
- You can say whatever you like.

01:22:56.372 --> 01:22:59.373
I won't
sit here and argue with you.

01:22:59.375 --> 01:23:02.009
Only uncertain
people have to argue.

01:23:02.011 --> 01:23:05.679
Fuck.

01:23:05.681 --> 01:23:07.414
- Hello?

01:23:07.416 --> 01:23:10.117
- Who the fuck is that?

01:23:10.119 --> 01:23:11.185
- Uh.

01:23:19.427 --> 01:23:21.729
- Let me help you out with that.

01:23:23.733 --> 01:23:27.034
No, come on, you're going
to hurt yourself, alright?

01:23:27.036 --> 01:23:28.435
Come on.

01:23:28.437 --> 01:23:31.171
Give me the ax.

01:23:31.173 --> 01:23:33.207
- Okay, okay, okay, okay.

01:23:33.209 --> 01:23:36.777
This is homoerotic and fun,
but let's do something else.

01:23:38.613 --> 01:23:40.514
Let's raise the stakes.

01:23:40.516 --> 01:23:42.383
On your way up
here, did you notice

01:23:42.385 --> 01:23:46.220
a broken green gate four
gates down from mine?

01:23:46.222 --> 01:23:48.122
My wacko neighbor?

01:23:48.124 --> 01:23:50.424
- Is this the guy who
likes to fire off his gun?

01:23:50.426 --> 01:23:52.159
- Exactly.

01:23:52.161 --> 01:23:55.362
Anyway she woke up one morning

01:23:55.364 --> 01:23:58.132
- with an erection.
- - She?

01:23:58.134 --> 01:24:00.134
- And claimed
the few feet of land

01:24:00.136 --> 01:24:01.735
right before my gate
belonged to her.

01:24:01.737 --> 01:24:04.571
- This is a woman who
likes to shoot her gun?

01:24:04.573 --> 01:24:06.607
- Yeah, why not?

01:24:06.609 --> 01:24:10.110
The second amendment should
be only for women, actually.

01:24:13.314 --> 01:24:17.618
Anyway, one night she
chainsawed down my mailbox

01:24:17.620 --> 01:24:21.355
to add to her ex-husband's
hoard of junk.

01:24:21.357 --> 01:24:23.424
- Did you call the cops?

01:24:23.426 --> 01:24:27.428
- I was going to take her
to court, but I forgot.

01:24:27.430 --> 01:24:30.664
But now that you're both here
with all this male aggression.

01:24:30.666 --> 01:24:33.734
I'd like you to run
over and get my mailbox.

01:24:35.770 --> 01:24:39.239
Whoever brings the mailbox back

01:24:41.109 --> 01:24:43.243
moves into first place.

01:24:45.380 --> 01:24:47.281
- I don't think it's a,

01:24:47.283 --> 01:24:48.615
I don't think it's a good idea.

01:24:48.617 --> 01:24:50.617
Wait.

01:24:50.619 --> 01:24:53.420
- I'm getting the fucking
box, you go back with Maya.

01:24:53.422 --> 01:24:55.422
- No, I thought
that the best strategy

01:24:55.424 --> 01:24:57.624
would be to have a strategy.

01:24:57.626 --> 01:24:59.460
- Yeah, I have a strategy.

01:24:59.462 --> 01:25:01.295
- Okay, but I
think it's important to

01:25:01.297 --> 01:25:04.098
not strike her as,
as aggressive, you know.

01:25:04.100 --> 01:25:05.632
- Okay, whatever.

01:25:05.634 --> 01:25:07.568
- The ax, oh.

01:25:15.643 --> 01:25:21.415
This is just really bad
planning, it's just really bad.

01:25:21.417 --> 01:25:24.751
I mean, we should
just ask her for it.

01:26:08.763 --> 01:26:09.763
Hello?

01:26:22.577 --> 01:26:25.679
Excuse me, is
there anybody here?

01:26:26.849 --> 01:26:28.549
- FBI.

01:26:28.551 --> 01:26:29.616
- Oh, god!

01:26:29.618 --> 01:26:30.851
Oh, we're friends.

01:26:30.853 --> 01:26:32.619
We, we're, we're neighbors.

01:26:32.621 --> 01:26:34.588
- Secret service, BIA.

01:26:34.590 --> 01:26:36.423
There goes everything.

01:26:39.261 --> 01:26:42.663
Suck my dick.

01:26:45.633 --> 01:26:48.202
- Can you put
the, put the gun down?

01:26:48.204 --> 01:26:50.404
- State your business.

01:26:50.406 --> 01:26:55.442
- I promise, I come here
with, with good intentions.

01:26:55.444 --> 01:26:57.644
I'm friends with Maya Dardel.

01:26:57.646 --> 01:26:59.279
- Oh, that bitch.

01:26:59.281 --> 01:27:00.847
She drives up my
road, up my ass.

01:27:00.849 --> 01:27:03.417
Now I'm a very private person.

01:27:03.419 --> 01:27:05.319
- But um.
- I'm a people.

01:27:05.321 --> 01:27:07.387
- I'm here to make peace.

01:27:07.389 --> 01:27:12.326
Uh, I know about the uh,
the land dispute and uh,

01:27:12.328 --> 01:27:17.364
I'd like to offer you, uh,
$300 for um, Maya's mailbox.

01:27:17.366 --> 01:27:20.767
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, wow.

01:27:20.769 --> 01:27:23.637
You can't buy a whole country.

01:27:23.639 --> 01:27:24.671
Shit.

01:27:24.673 --> 01:27:26.640
- Sure, sure.

01:27:26.642 --> 01:27:28.408
- Oh, worry, Billy.

01:27:28.410 --> 01:27:31.445
Right, I forgot the plan.

01:27:31.447 --> 01:27:34.548
The plan, the plan, the
plan, the plan.

01:27:37.619 --> 01:27:38.652
Oat bran.

01:27:38.654 --> 01:27:39.653
- What?

01:27:39.655 --> 01:27:40.721
- Oat bran.

01:27:44.459 --> 01:27:47.661
A man was sentenced to death.

01:27:49.331 --> 01:27:50.931
What, what?

01:27:50.933 --> 01:27:52.499
Okay. We gotta move.

01:27:52.501 --> 01:27:53.700
- Move.
- Okay.

01:27:53.702 --> 01:27:55.302
- Move move move move.

01:27:55.304 --> 01:27:56.637
- We can, we could
talk this out...

01:27:56.639 --> 01:27:57.638
- Go, go, go.
- If you want.

01:27:57.640 --> 01:27:59.373
- This way.

01:27:59.375 --> 01:28:01.475
Move it, move it, move it.

01:28:01.477 --> 01:28:04.778
This is the paradox of
the unexpected hanging.

01:28:04.780 --> 01:28:06.313
It's from the 1950s.

01:28:06.315 --> 01:28:08.048
As the crocodile said himself,

01:28:08.050 --> 01:28:10.884
you can't know which
day you're gonna die.

01:28:10.886 --> 01:28:13.887
So it can't be next Sunday.

01:28:13.889 --> 01:28:15.889
- Why not?

01:28:15.891 --> 01:28:17.791
- Ah, because. The
judge says the hanging will

01:28:17.793 --> 01:28:21.461
take place on one of the
seven days of next week.

01:28:21.463 --> 01:28:26.466
You will not know which
day you'll be hanged.

01:28:26.468 --> 01:28:29.836
You'll be hanged on a
day you don't expect.

01:28:29.838 --> 01:28:32.072
- Hello.

01:28:32.074 --> 01:28:36.877
- But on Thursday, to the
prisoner's huge fucking surprise,

01:28:36.879 --> 01:28:39.746
the hangman arrives and says,

01:28:39.748 --> 01:28:42.015
I'm gonna hang you in an hour.

01:28:46.654 --> 01:28:47.654
- Fuck.

01:28:48.890 --> 01:28:50.691
- Please, please don't kill me.

01:28:50.693 --> 01:28:52.626
- Kill you?

01:28:52.628 --> 01:28:53.660
- Jesus Christ.

01:28:56.798 --> 01:28:58.532
Ah!

01:29:14.683 --> 01:29:16.483
What?

01:29:16.485 --> 01:29:21.021
I, I told you then, you
chose not to hear me.

01:29:21.023 --> 01:29:24.691
So I let you play
a little longer.

01:29:24.693 --> 01:29:26.093
- Are you serious?

01:29:26.095 --> 01:29:29.463
- Mm hm, he wins, you lose.

01:29:29.465 --> 01:29:33.667
You lost the first
time you came up here.

01:29:33.669 --> 01:29:35.669
Then what the fuck
have I been doing

01:29:35.671 --> 01:29:41.475
up here making this
pathetic baby look bad?

01:29:41.477 --> 01:29:43.677
- Ansel is a better
writer than you are.

01:29:43.679 --> 01:29:47.948
He's not pathetic,
he's just sheltered.

01:29:50.785 --> 01:29:52.786
What's so horrible about that?

01:29:52.788 --> 01:29:54.521
- Are you fucking kidding me?

01:29:54.523 --> 01:29:56.390
- It's never been
a real competition.

01:29:56.392 --> 01:29:59.092
I've been using you to
see if Ansel's capable.

01:29:59.094 --> 01:30:01.428
I need someone who can defend

01:30:01.430 --> 01:30:04.631
the posthumous Maya
against your type.

01:30:04.633 --> 01:30:07.567
They'll try to make
me into unstable

01:30:07.569 --> 01:30:10.637
or hysterical or who knows what.

01:30:12.507 --> 01:30:14.141
They'll butcher my books,

01:30:14.143 --> 01:30:15.842
they'll rape my dead body.

01:30:15.844 --> 01:30:19.546
They'll turn me into Plath.

01:30:19.548 --> 01:30:20.680
- You wish.

01:30:20.682 --> 01:30:21.681
- You see?

01:30:21.683 --> 01:30:23.417
You see.

01:30:23.419 --> 01:30:25.685
- What about the money
I've spent on gas?

01:30:25.687 --> 01:30:28.488
You know I skipped work
again last Thursday.

01:30:28.490 --> 01:30:30.657
Are you saying I get nothing?

01:30:30.659 --> 01:30:32.793
- You got to fuck
me, didn't you?

01:30:32.795 --> 01:30:35.695
- Oh, what an honor.

01:30:35.697 --> 01:30:37.731
I'm just lucky I took
that initiative, you know,

01:30:37.733 --> 01:30:40.200
because you would have just
left me with blue balls.

01:30:44.705 --> 01:30:46.706
You know, I don't even
think you're even gonna

01:30:46.708 --> 01:30:48.708
have the cojones
to kill yourself.

01:30:48.710 --> 01:30:50.544
- Take a step back, Paul.
I don't like you hovering.

01:30:50.546 --> 01:30:52.746
- Oh, you don't
like me hovering?

01:30:56.651 --> 01:30:59.453
You're never gonna
kill yourself.

01:30:59.455 --> 01:31:02.456
I know you, you'll
rot up here for years.

01:31:04.459 --> 01:31:09.596
You just, you just wanted
some attention from some guy

01:31:09.598 --> 01:31:14.634
who would never look at
you on a city street.

01:31:14.636 --> 01:31:19.706
So you hide up here
like a little witch,

01:31:19.708 --> 01:31:24.244
you do your make-up oh so
carefully and you lure us

01:31:24.246 --> 01:31:27.514
up here to lick your
old pussy, because, hey,

01:31:27.516 --> 01:31:30.617
I don't see any fucking
hot young 24-year-olds

01:31:30.619 --> 01:31:33.487
fucking up your local
monopoly on womanhood.

01:31:33.489 --> 01:31:35.088
Are you fucking serious?

01:31:35.090 --> 01:31:37.090
- Out, you're out.

01:31:37.092 --> 01:31:39.259
You don't talk to me like that
in my own house, you're out!

01:31:39.261 --> 01:31:40.727
- I'm not out. You're out.

01:31:40.729 --> 01:31:42.162
- You're out.

01:31:42.164 --> 01:31:43.497
Ansel!

01:31:43.499 --> 01:31:44.898
- Get the fuck back!

01:31:44.900 --> 01:31:47.000
- You're out, out!

01:31:47.002 --> 01:31:48.034
Get out!

01:31:50.072 --> 01:31:52.539
Out!
- I'm fucking sick of you!

01:31:52.541 --> 01:31:54.708
- Get off of her!

01:31:57.980 --> 01:32:00.881
- Fuck, fuck!

01:32:08.022 --> 01:32:09.523
You fuck-ups.

01:32:11.526 --> 01:32:13.727
I'm not even violent, I,

01:32:17.533 --> 01:32:21.001
you know what, you
get what you deserve.

01:32:23.538 --> 01:32:25.739
I don't know anyone with
one ounce of testosterone

01:32:25.741 --> 01:32:28.675
who wouldn't fucking defend
himself from you lunatics.

01:32:36.083 --> 01:32:37.684
Are you okay?

01:32:37.686 --> 01:32:39.953
[Paul screams

01:32:44.126 --> 01:32:46.259
I'm fucking outta here.

01:32:47.962 --> 01:32:51.331
Sociopaths!

01:33:59.333 --> 01:34:02.636
- You need to
navigate this exactly

01:34:02.638 --> 01:34:05.739
because they're not
going to find a body,

01:34:05.741 --> 01:34:08.775
and I don't want you having
to wait seven years before...

01:34:08.777 --> 01:34:12.412
- yeah, I um, I memorized
your binder system on Monday.

01:34:12.414 --> 01:34:14.981
- Alright, alright, fine.

01:34:14.983 --> 01:34:19.419
You'll talk about all this
again with your new lawyer.

01:34:19.421 --> 01:34:23.690
All mine is yours,
even my lawyer.

01:34:23.692 --> 01:34:24.991
- Thank you, Maya.

01:34:26.060 --> 01:34:27.761
- Don't thank me.

01:34:27.763 --> 01:34:31.731
He's an anarchist,
and I'm a monster.

01:34:31.733 --> 01:34:36.102
This may all end up
being a nasty con-job.

01:34:36.104 --> 01:34:38.972
I took out a giant
loan on this land

01:34:38.974 --> 01:34:40.974
about a year ago
and put the money

01:34:40.976 --> 01:34:44.744
in a little mafia boutique
bank in the Cayman Islands.

01:34:44.746 --> 01:34:48.081
- Yeah, I read that
in the yellow binder.

01:34:48.083 --> 01:34:49.949
Why did you do that?

01:34:52.153 --> 01:34:53.887
- Complicated.

01:34:53.889 --> 01:34:56.856
A dishonest broker,
my own mistakes.

01:34:59.160 --> 01:35:00.760
- Hmm.

01:35:06.767 --> 01:35:08.468
What is this?

01:35:08.470 --> 01:35:11.337
- I don't know, looks like junk.

01:35:11.339 --> 01:35:13.339
- Maybe something
that blew over here

01:35:13.341 --> 01:35:16.776
in the windstorm from
Nora's junk-heap.

01:35:23.084 --> 01:35:28.855
- Looks like it's
uh, some sort of tube

01:35:28.857 --> 01:35:31.825
made out of a,
made out of cloth.

01:35:34.028 --> 01:35:35.361
Here.

01:35:37.965 --> 01:35:39.933
Please hold it.

01:35:39.935 --> 01:35:41.201
- Ech.

01:35:43.037 --> 01:35:46.773
Ah, is there a plan
here, what are we doing?

01:35:51.779 --> 01:35:54.781
- Put your head inside.

01:35:54.783 --> 01:35:56.216
- No thanks.

01:35:57.318 --> 01:35:59.285
- Please, Maya.

01:36:00.855 --> 01:36:02.756
Come on.

01:36:02.758 --> 01:36:03.758
Come on.

01:36:14.769 --> 01:36:15.769
Hi.

01:36:18.773 --> 01:36:19.773
- Hi.

01:36:23.544 --> 01:36:26.780
- It's like Eden in here.

01:36:31.185 --> 01:36:33.386
- You don't get the money
in the Cayman Islands.

01:36:33.388 --> 01:36:38.558
Does that change your
loyalty to me, to my work?

01:36:38.560 --> 01:36:41.795
- I don't care about money.

01:36:41.797 --> 01:36:42.797
- Oh, no?

01:36:44.331 --> 01:36:46.266
You're not corrupt like me.

01:36:49.036 --> 01:36:52.372
- No, I mean that I have enough.

01:36:52.374 --> 01:36:54.340
- Enough what?

01:36:56.377 --> 01:37:00.213
- Money from, from
my father dying.

01:37:08.589 --> 01:37:12.392
- Not enough to
keep this land, though.

01:37:12.394 --> 01:37:14.894
- Oh, I don't know.

01:37:16.397 --> 01:37:18.398
I'll talk about it
with your lawyer,

01:37:18.400 --> 01:37:21.935
when you're uh,
when you're gone.

01:37:27.408 --> 01:37:31.978
- Oh, what a relief.

01:37:32.947 --> 01:37:35.014
- What?

01:37:35.016 --> 01:37:37.851
- My fucking ear just unplugged.

01:38:21.395 --> 01:38:24.631
I'll be gone in 10 minutes.

01:38:24.633 --> 01:38:26.599
- Really?
- Uh huh.

01:38:28.402 --> 01:38:31.170
- It's so early.

01:38:31.172 --> 01:38:32.605
- Come.

01:38:37.244 --> 01:38:39.412
- Wait a second.

01:38:39.414 --> 01:38:42.115
Um, I have something for you.

01:38:44.618 --> 01:38:48.087
It's uh, I wrote it

01:38:48.089 --> 01:38:50.023
down for you to take.

01:38:53.227 --> 01:38:55.929
- Hmm?

01:38:55.931 --> 01:39:02.035
- It's a description of
Dinesen, of Karen Blixen.

01:39:02.037 --> 01:39:05.471
- Karen Blixen, not my favorite.

01:39:07.374 --> 01:39:10.443
- Okay, um, but
this was written by

01:39:10.445 --> 01:39:14.647
one of the few men
who liked her that

01:39:14.649 --> 01:39:21.587
managed not to fall into
her entourage of slaves.

01:39:24.191 --> 01:39:27.627
It's kind of just, I'm just,

01:39:27.629 --> 01:39:31.631
I'm just gonna, I'm
gonna read it for you.

01:39:35.402 --> 01:39:39.372
She knew everything about
the sublimation of loss,

01:39:39.374 --> 01:39:42.508
about suffering as the
nourishment of genius,

01:39:42.510 --> 01:39:47.113
about pain's residence as
Harmony in a work of art.

01:39:47.115 --> 01:39:48.681
And all the same she yielded

01:39:48.683 --> 01:39:51.617
to the most banal human
moods and impulses.

01:39:51.619 --> 01:39:58.157
Pettiness, impatience,
caprice, stinginess.

01:39:58.159 --> 01:39:59.592
She suffered from a craving

01:39:59.594 --> 01:40:03.429
for power despite
her generosity.

01:40:03.431 --> 01:40:05.398
She toyed with
human fates despite

01:40:05.400 --> 01:40:07.767
her contempt for such toying.

01:40:07.769 --> 01:40:11.504
She suffered from self-contempt
in spite of her mighty,

01:40:11.506 --> 01:40:15.108
legitimate
self-confidence and pride.

01:40:15.110 --> 01:40:17.210
She was a paradox,
outside of any

01:40:17.212 --> 01:40:22.015
moral category,
and also, a bad judge.

01:40:28.455 --> 01:40:32.058
- Now uh, help me
load up the car.

01:40:32.060 --> 01:40:34.527
I can't carry any of these.

01:40:37.431 --> 01:40:40.233
It's amazing how much
cosmetics and clothing

01:40:40.235 --> 01:40:43.636
a woman needs just
to end her own life.

01:41:04.458 --> 01:41:07.360
In a window, I recognized you.

01:41:10.431 --> 01:41:14.267
You must be the
one I can't name.

01:41:14.269 --> 01:41:17.737
The man with a faint voice.

01:41:17.739 --> 01:41:19.472
Behind my voice.

01:41:21.375 --> 01:41:23.643
I thought it too was mine.

01:41:25.813 --> 01:41:28.648
The Cadence was borrowed.

01:41:28.650 --> 01:41:31.851
Thick, muscular chords.

01:41:31.853 --> 01:41:34.220
Like those in the
baritone's throat

01:41:34.222 --> 01:41:37.423
one day in Europe somewhere.

01:41:37.425 --> 01:41:42.462
Years ago, with a
friend who since died.

01:41:42.464 --> 01:41:46.232
If clocks can be
trusted with one's life.

01:41:48.669 --> 01:41:53.439
In some temple or chapel
we paid to hear a man sing.

01:41:55.843 --> 01:41:58.311
I thought I recognized
in the baritone

01:41:58.313 --> 01:42:01.647
Sonic and temporal glass,

01:42:01.649 --> 01:42:06.752
in the thickness of
that, a note of my own.

01:42:06.754 --> 01:42:09.455
An affinity there.

01:42:09.457 --> 01:42:13.626
Where such ciphers as
love and infinity's brook

01:42:13.628 --> 01:42:16.662
known maudlin or
essential sense,

01:42:18.665 --> 01:42:20.766
but anyway somehow sing.

01:42:22.536 --> 01:42:25.338
Like one sings to a
child who can't touch.

01:42:29.576 --> 01:42:31.677
Out there in the
part of my voice

01:42:31.679 --> 01:42:34.447
that remains unselfconscious.

01:42:38.452 --> 01:42:41.921
I thought I saw you
in the window there.

01:42:45.359 --> 01:42:47.293
In that part of town.

01:42:52.266 --> 01:42:54.467
I thought you
would look like me.

01:42:56.670 --> 01:42:59.639
But you must be an adopted son.
