WEBVTT

00:01.835 --> 00:03.204
Family is the ultimate power
on The Gifted.

00:03.237 --> 00:05.573
A lot of people
have been fighting this fight
for a long time,

00:05.606 --> 00:07.141
and now it's our turn.

00:07.175 --> 00:08.976
Catch all-new episodes Mondays.

00:09.009 --> 00:10.711
And check out our other
Fox programs-- The Orville,

00:10.744 --> 00:12.546
Lucifer, and Gotham.

00:12.580 --> 00:14.715
Gotham needs more people
who are willing
to fight for her.

00:14.748 --> 00:15.749
Only on Fox.

00:18.686 --> 00:21.222
Wow.

00:21.255 --> 00:22.756
I think
it's the aurora borealis.

00:22.790 --> 00:24.825
They say it's the most
beautiful thing on earth.

00:24.858 --> 00:26.694
Not even close.

00:26.727 --> 00:28.496
(weapon firing)

00:28.529 --> 00:30.398
-(grunts)
-Marcos! -OFFICER: Freeze!

00:30.431 --> 00:33.334
-(Taser crackles,
Polaris groans) -Lorna!

00:33.367 --> 00:34.735
THUNDERBIRD:
Clarissa's power has always

00:34.768 --> 00:36.404
been fueled by fear. She needs

00:36.437 --> 00:37.438
to find something
she cares about enough

00:37.471 --> 00:40.108
-to get past it.
-Let me help.

00:40.141 --> 00:42.376
I need you to make
a portal, get a car

00:42.410 --> 00:44.078
-off the road.
-A car? Are you insane?

00:44.112 --> 00:47.515
DREAMER: She needed something
to connect to, so I gave her

00:47.548 --> 00:49.083
a memory of us.

00:49.117 --> 00:51.452
Do you realize what you've done?
What that could lead to?

00:51.485 --> 00:53.454
We are gonna do a deal today.

00:53.487 --> 00:55.556
And my wife and children stay
out of prison.

00:55.589 --> 00:58.526
One condition:
I get the Mutant Underground.

00:58.559 --> 01:00.060
This is Reed.

01:00.094 --> 01:01.462
We leave
for the Underground tonight.

01:01.495 --> 01:03.264
-Stop the van.
-What?

01:03.297 --> 01:04.932
Sentinel Services
put a tracker on me.

01:04.965 --> 01:07.101
No. No! You just made

01:07.135 --> 01:10.037
the biggest mistake
of your life. We had a deal.

01:10.070 --> 01:11.205
Reed's alive.

01:11.239 --> 01:12.206
-Oh, my...
-Sentinel Services

01:12.240 --> 01:13.807
are taking him to a facility

01:13.841 --> 01:15.976
along with some woman from
the Underground.

01:16.009 --> 01:17.611
You have to face the fact
that you're not gonna

01:17.645 --> 01:20.348
-see him again.
-You're wrong.

01:22.683 --> 01:25.085
(insects buzzing)

01:25.119 --> 01:26.787
(hand slapping)

01:29.523 --> 01:32.326
-(sighs)
-You all right there?

01:32.360 --> 01:33.894
You know, back in the Corps,
I used to think

01:33.927 --> 01:35.596
the cold was the worst part,
but I got to say,

01:35.629 --> 01:38.232
these bugs might change my mind.
You know what we need?

01:38.266 --> 01:40.668
We need a mutant
who keeps bugs away.

01:40.701 --> 01:43.137
-Or a can of bug spray.
-(chuckles)

01:45.005 --> 01:46.140
You should have sent me
in first.

01:46.174 --> 01:48.008
I could have knocked out
the power, everything.

01:48.041 --> 01:50.578
Yeah. And then they would have
known we were here immediately.

01:50.611 --> 01:51.979
Look, we stick to the plan.

01:52.012 --> 01:53.914
We'll wait for them
to get to that second fence,

01:53.947 --> 01:55.916
they send us the signal,
then we get in there.

01:55.949 --> 01:57.851
(sighs) It just pisses me off,
you know?

01:57.885 --> 02:00.421
They call it
a mutant relocation facility,

02:00.454 --> 02:03.757
like it's just some nice place
to pass the time?

02:03.791 --> 02:05.259
Hey, we got you out of there.

02:05.293 --> 02:06.594
We're gonna get them out, too,
all right?

02:06.627 --> 02:08.662
Oorah.

02:08.696 --> 02:10.664
Oorah is right.

02:11.832 --> 02:14.335
-(gunfire)
-Was that...?

02:14.368 --> 02:16.870
-(alarm sounding) -MAN: Get
down! They found us! Get down!

02:16.904 --> 02:19.807
(gunfire)

02:19.840 --> 02:22.109
(panting)

02:22.142 --> 02:24.345
Randall's dead. Elsa, too.

02:24.378 --> 02:26.614
-(bullets whizzing)
-(groans)

02:26.647 --> 02:29.016
-What happened? -They have a
whole system of automated guns,

02:29.049 --> 02:31.285
infrared trackers. With that
kind of hardware, there's no way

02:31.319 --> 02:33.854
-we're making it out of here.
-(Eclipse groans, Sage gasps)

02:33.887 --> 02:35.489
Look, if I can get closer,
I can shut down their system

02:35.523 --> 02:37.057
and the automated weapons.
I can buy you some time.

02:37.090 --> 02:38.292
-Yeah, what about you?
-Look, I'll be fine.

02:38.326 --> 02:39.860
I'll be right behind you, okay?

02:39.893 --> 02:41.495
Just go!

02:41.529 --> 02:44.565
(alarm sounding)

02:44.598 --> 02:46.867
(distant shouting)

02:49.770 --> 02:52.105
(dogs barking)

02:53.874 --> 02:55.743
(distant shouting)

03:04.852 --> 03:07.988
Pulse! Gus?

03:08.021 --> 03:12.726
Gus? No! No!

03:12.760 --> 03:15.095
*

03:22.870 --> 03:24.472
(alarm chirps)

03:31.379 --> 03:33.213
Nice digs you got here.

03:33.247 --> 03:34.915
Homey.

03:34.948 --> 03:37.117
Yeah, don't get too comfy.

03:37.150 --> 03:39.253
You're only gonna enjoy our
hospitality for a couple days.

03:39.287 --> 03:40.588
Then what?

03:40.621 --> 03:43.023
Oh, let me guess.
Another transfer.

03:43.056 --> 03:45.125
Maybe one
of your secret prisons?

03:45.158 --> 03:46.894
You know, you had your chance
to cooperate, Ms. Dane.

03:46.927 --> 03:50.464
Little favor? Call me Polaris.

03:50.498 --> 03:53.701
You're sending me to Hell, I
think it's the least you can do.

03:53.734 --> 03:55.636
(buzzing)

03:55.669 --> 03:57.971
(door opens)

03:59.072 --> 04:01.275
(door closes)

04:02.610 --> 04:05.579
That's interesting.

04:05.613 --> 04:08.716
You want to tell me what my
prosecutor's doing in a cell?

04:08.749 --> 04:11.285
JACE: Mr. Strucker's got
legal problems of his own.

04:11.319 --> 04:14.955
He's heading
to the same place you are.

04:14.988 --> 04:18.258
The same son of a bitch
who tried to use my unborn child

04:18.292 --> 04:20.494
to get me
to turn against my friends

04:20.528 --> 04:22.129
is going to prison with me?

04:22.162 --> 04:23.997
What is it, my birthday?

04:24.031 --> 04:26.900
I'm glad you're enjoying
yourself, Ms. Dane.

04:26.934 --> 04:29.269
It's Polaris.

04:31.004 --> 04:32.440
(lock clicks, buzzer sounds)

04:32.473 --> 04:34.241
(door closes)

04:34.274 --> 04:38.011
Code Lang 5-0-1-niner.
Security check-in.

04:38.045 --> 04:39.747
-Affirmative.
-(whispering): Listen to me.

04:39.780 --> 04:41.081
Both prisoners
have been secured.

04:41.114 --> 04:42.149
A whole lot of things
have happened

04:42.182 --> 04:43.451
that you don't know about.

04:43.484 --> 04:44.785
We need to stick together.

04:44.818 --> 04:46.787
Are you asking me for help?

04:46.820 --> 04:48.989
You do remember
our last meeting, right?

04:49.022 --> 04:50.658
I know Marcos.

04:50.691 --> 04:54.227
I was working with him.
That's why I'm here.

04:56.697 --> 04:58.332
Okay, then tell me about that.

04:58.366 --> 05:00.100
He was helping my family.

05:00.133 --> 05:02.636
-We got caught
by Sentinel Services... -Oh, so,

05:02.670 --> 05:05.439
not only did you try
to put me in prison forever,

05:05.473 --> 05:07.441
but you also
almost got Marcos killed?

05:07.475 --> 05:10.110
If we're gonna have a chance
at getting out of here, we...

05:10.143 --> 05:12.480
Please, Ms. Dane. Polaris.

05:12.513 --> 05:14.014
Guard, this man is bothering me.

05:14.047 --> 05:15.849
Shut up... both of you!

05:21.355 --> 05:23.223
THUNDERBIRD:
We know that Lorna

05:23.256 --> 05:25.626
is being held in a cell
at the Sentinel Services

05:25.659 --> 05:27.127
Regional Headquarters.

05:27.160 --> 05:29.062
We believe that Reed Strucker
is there with her.

05:29.096 --> 05:31.965
They're being moved soon
to an ultrasecure facility.

05:31.999 --> 05:34.334
And we don't know much
about it,

05:34.368 --> 05:36.236
except that the people
who go don't come back.

05:36.269 --> 05:38.506
That's why we got to move now.

05:38.539 --> 05:40.874
And I'm not gonna
sugarcoat this.

05:40.908 --> 05:43.176
We're talking about attacking
the Sentinel Services.

05:43.210 --> 05:47.247
(indistinct chatter)

05:47.280 --> 05:49.149
We lost six people the last time

05:49.182 --> 05:50.584
we went up against them
directly.

05:50.618 --> 05:52.185
THUNDERBIRD:
I know that better than anyone.

05:52.219 --> 05:54.354
-It won't be like last time.
-SAGE: You're right.

05:54.388 --> 05:55.923
Last time,
we just hit a relocation center

05:55.956 --> 05:58.726
with a fence
and some guard towers.

05:58.759 --> 06:01.028
This time it's a prison.
Their systems have improved.

06:01.061 --> 06:03.196
Extrapolating
from other attacks,

06:03.230 --> 06:05.999
we've got an 86.5% chance
of failure.

06:06.033 --> 06:08.001
ECLIPSE: And if we do nothing,
then there's

06:08.035 --> 06:09.770
a 100% chance
we never see them again.

06:12.372 --> 06:13.774
I know we're new here,
but please.

06:16.410 --> 06:19.012
Lorna's risked her life
for everyone in this room.

06:19.046 --> 06:21.782
Harry, your parents
would be dead without her.

06:21.815 --> 06:25.052
Sage, she pulled you out of
a gutter, and she got you clean.

06:25.085 --> 06:26.454
I mean, she's...

06:27.988 --> 06:30.558
She needs us.

06:30.591 --> 06:31.759
Doesn't change the math, Marcos.

06:31.792 --> 06:33.026
I don't care about the math.

06:33.060 --> 06:34.962
I care about Lorna.

06:36.564 --> 06:38.098
Who's with me?

06:39.500 --> 06:41.401
I'm in.

06:44.438 --> 06:47.140
Yeah, I'm in.

06:48.241 --> 06:50.310
Okay.

06:51.612 --> 06:54.114
Dad is so screwed.

06:54.147 --> 06:56.416
We'll figure something out.

06:56.450 --> 06:58.318
Did you see
how many people bailed?

06:58.351 --> 07:00.153
I-I mean,
did you hear computer girl?

07:00.187 --> 07:03.557
Basically, what she said is,
Dad is screwed.

07:03.591 --> 07:06.594
-Andy, please, don't talk
like that. -You know it's true.

07:06.627 --> 07:10.097
We can't afford
to think that way right now.

07:10.130 --> 07:12.132
So, are we just gonna live
in fantasyland?

07:12.165 --> 07:14.668
-Nobody's on our side.
-It's not just that, Mom.

07:14.702 --> 07:18.706
I mean,
this is all such a huge risk.

07:20.874 --> 07:23.076
Well, sometimes you just got
to take a risk

07:23.110 --> 07:24.945
and hope for the best.

07:27.715 --> 07:30.083
ECLIPSE:
Five people? Unbelievable.

07:30.117 --> 07:32.119
Marcos, don't be so hard on 'em.

07:32.152 --> 07:34.087
A lot of 'em lost friends
the last time.

07:34.121 --> 07:36.524
(sighs) Five of us
to break into a prison.

07:36.557 --> 07:40.828
Um, six, technically.

07:40.861 --> 07:42.429
I'm sorry, Caitlin, but...

07:42.462 --> 07:43.497
BLINK:
So how are we gonna do this?

07:43.531 --> 07:44.998
If there's a window, I can

07:45.032 --> 07:46.433
portal us in,
but there's gonna be

07:46.466 --> 07:48.536
guards and cameras.
Harry, could you...?

07:48.569 --> 07:53.774
I can make the guards see this,
but not the cameras.

07:53.807 --> 07:56.343
Well, if we go in like that,
we're never coming out again.

07:56.376 --> 07:58.011
-Exactly.
-What if we don't go in?

07:59.980 --> 08:02.182
Look, I know I can't
shoot lasers from my hands,

08:02.215 --> 08:05.719
but I do have an idea.

08:05.753 --> 08:08.388
Daniel said the place
they're taking them is far away.

08:08.421 --> 08:10.624
To put them on a plane,
they'd have to move them.

08:10.658 --> 08:12.526
Let's get them
while they're moving.

08:13.827 --> 08:15.495
That's not a bad idea.

08:15.529 --> 08:17.464
It could work,
but we don't know the route.

08:17.497 --> 08:19.533
-Without that... -I think
I might know how to get it.

08:19.567 --> 08:22.302
How? We don't have anyone
with that kind of intel.

08:22.335 --> 08:23.704
The network doesn't,
but I might.

08:23.737 --> 08:25.338
The cartel?

08:26.674 --> 08:28.676
They have people everywhere,
man.

08:28.709 --> 08:30.177
THUNDERBIRD:
The last time the cartel

08:30.210 --> 08:32.179
got their hooks in you,
you barely got out.

08:32.212 --> 08:35.716
Marcos... you sure you want
to go back to that?

08:35.749 --> 08:38.218
No... but I'm out
of better ideas.

08:43.624 --> 08:44.892
Hey.

08:44.925 --> 08:46.660
Hey. Would you like some?

08:46.694 --> 08:50.163
No, no, I'm fine. Um...

08:50.197 --> 08:54.201
So, did you ever talk
to Clarice about what happened?

08:54.234 --> 08:57.204
(sighs)
No.

08:57.237 --> 09:00.040
-We should.
-You know, she seems fine.

09:00.073 --> 09:03.543
-I really don't think it's
necessary... -Sonya, it's wrong.

09:03.577 --> 09:06.580
You gave her a memory-- it isn't
hers-- without her permission.

09:06.614 --> 09:08.616
-A memory of me.
-It's not like that.

09:08.649 --> 09:11.218
It's like a dream, okay, or,

09:11.251 --> 09:12.452
-or an impression.
-Oh.

09:12.485 --> 09:14.622
-It will fade.
-And what if it doesn't?

09:14.655 --> 09:17.424
You should tell her.

09:17.457 --> 09:19.559
If you don't, I will.

09:19.593 --> 09:21.228
You don't know
how she's gonna react.

09:21.261 --> 09:22.796
Okay, say you tell her.

09:22.830 --> 09:25.432
Maybe she's cool with it,
or maybe she leaves.

09:25.465 --> 09:28.468
And if she does, then you can
forget about saving anyone.

09:28.501 --> 09:32.205
Look, I know that you're not
happy with what I did,

09:32.239 --> 09:35.275
but I had no choice, okay?

09:35.308 --> 09:36.610
I had to save you.

09:36.644 --> 09:39.980
All of you.
And if I'd had the time,

09:40.013 --> 09:42.215
then, yes,
I would have asked her.

09:42.249 --> 09:45.653
And what if she said no?

09:45.686 --> 09:48.255
I wasn't gonna let you die.

09:50.023 --> 09:53.661
This is a war, Johnny.

09:53.694 --> 09:55.963
In case you forgot.

10:01.601 --> 10:03.070
(Spanish-language
music playing)

10:03.103 --> 10:05.438
Go on in, enjoy.

10:05.472 --> 10:08.341
Oye, Francisco.

10:08.375 --> 10:10.610
Been too long.
Looking good, man.

10:10.644 --> 10:12.245
What are you doing here?

10:12.279 --> 10:14.181
-Wait, tha-that's far enough.
-Whoa.

10:14.214 --> 10:15.649
Don't-don't point
those things at me.

10:15.683 --> 10:17.184
Close your hands into fists.

10:17.217 --> 10:18.585
Get 'em behind your head.

10:18.618 --> 10:21.454
Cálmate. I just
came to talk, okay?

10:22.522 --> 10:25.125
(Spanish-language music playing)

10:25.158 --> 10:27.394
(crowd chatter)

10:38.205 --> 10:42.475
Well, if it isn't Marcos Diaz,
back where

10:42.509 --> 10:45.045
-he said he'd never be again.
-Carmen, hey.

10:45.078 --> 10:46.814
Uh, look,
I don't want any trouble.

10:46.847 --> 10:48.548
Why would I cause trouble?

10:48.581 --> 10:50.483
You, uh, weren't too happy
with me for a while there.

10:50.517 --> 10:51.885
How did you think I'd react

10:51.919 --> 10:53.887
after you snuck out of bed
and disappeared?

10:53.921 --> 10:55.823
Uh...

11:00.327 --> 11:02.195
Marcos, relax.

11:02.229 --> 11:03.630
I'm messing with you.

11:03.663 --> 11:05.465
-It was a long time ago.
-Yeah.

11:05.498 --> 11:07.901
So, what can I do for you?

11:09.502 --> 11:11.304
Uh, I'm just here
to see your father.

11:11.338 --> 11:13.006
See, this is what happens
when you don't

11:13.040 --> 11:14.641
keep up with old friends.

11:14.674 --> 11:16.476
Papá retired.

11:16.509 --> 11:18.478
So, who's in charge?

11:18.511 --> 11:21.681
You want to talk business,
you talk with me.

11:21.715 --> 11:24.017
*

11:26.954 --> 11:30.190
So, what do you think
of my club?

11:30.223 --> 11:32.692
Well, you made some changes.

11:32.726 --> 11:36.529
-It's nice. -Hmm. You don't need
to lie to me, Marcos.

11:36.563 --> 11:38.565
You don't like
this kind of music.

11:38.598 --> 11:40.700
Yeah, well,
you don't like it either.

11:40.734 --> 11:44.204
What I like
is having an operation that can

11:44.237 --> 11:46.539
run $3 million cash through

11:46.573 --> 11:48.575
and deposit it
in an American bank.

11:48.608 --> 11:50.110
I liked the old place,

11:50.143 --> 11:52.846
but Papá's bar
couldn't clean that much.

11:52.880 --> 11:55.048
So...

11:55.082 --> 11:58.952
We need to have a drink, yes,
to celebrate your return?

12:00.587 --> 12:02.890
Thanks,
but I'm not here to socialize.

12:02.923 --> 12:04.792
Look, I need information.

12:04.825 --> 12:06.459
Sentinel Services is moving
a couple of people.

12:06.493 --> 12:07.928
I need to know where and when.

12:07.961 --> 12:09.729
Hitting Sentinel Services?

12:09.763 --> 12:11.131
That's a suicide mission.

12:11.164 --> 12:12.800
Who are these prisoners?

12:12.833 --> 12:16.469
Ah, one's a former prosecutor,
the other is, um...

12:16.503 --> 12:20.740
-She's... -Wait, is this about
the girl you left me for?

12:20.774 --> 12:24.711
-The magnet girl?
-(quietly): Yeah.

12:24.744 --> 12:27.647
Tell me, how do you think
she'd feel if she knew

12:27.680 --> 12:29.049
you were here groveling to me?

12:29.082 --> 12:30.483
Are you gonna help me, or not?

12:30.517 --> 12:32.419
Help-- it's an interesting word.

12:32.452 --> 12:34.321
Remember when you came here
with Papá

12:34.354 --> 12:38.325
to help him
with business in Atlanta?

12:38.358 --> 12:40.493
Do you know how many shipments
we lost when you left?

12:40.527 --> 12:42.429
Carmen, I was muscle.
I wasn't that important.

12:42.462 --> 12:43.964
My father loved you.

12:43.997 --> 12:46.166
He thought of you as a son.

12:46.199 --> 12:50.170
He thought you'd marry me,
take care of this family,

12:50.203 --> 12:52.772
-repay him for everything
he did for you. -It was...

12:52.806 --> 12:54.774
hard for me, too.

12:54.808 --> 12:56.409
I'm sorry.

12:56.443 --> 12:58.645
I don't have a lot of time here.
Look, Carmen,

12:58.678 --> 13:00.447
please. Can you get
the information I need, or not?

13:00.480 --> 13:01.982
Of course I can,

13:02.015 --> 13:06.253
but I only do favors
for my friends.

13:06.286 --> 13:09.089
So...

13:09.122 --> 13:11.658
after all this time,

13:11.691 --> 13:14.895
do you want to be my friend
again?

13:40.487 --> 13:43.623
(heart beating)

13:43.656 --> 13:46.559
(moans)

13:50.030 --> 13:52.265
(gasps)

13:57.237 --> 13:59.772
(sighs)

14:02.442 --> 14:04.844
(sighs)
I don't like it, brother.

14:04.878 --> 14:07.480
Whatever you think this is gonna
cost, it's gonna be more.

14:07.514 --> 14:09.316
ECLIPSE: Yeah, I'll deal
with that later. Listen,

14:09.349 --> 14:10.717
they made some calls
to some contacts

14:10.750 --> 14:12.352
they have in Sentinel Services.

14:12.385 --> 14:14.254
They're moving Lorna and Reed
by truck. It's a convoy.

14:14.287 --> 14:15.688
-I'll send you the route.
-When?

14:15.722 --> 14:17.057
I don't know the time frame yet.

14:17.090 --> 14:18.491
I'm working on that.

14:18.525 --> 14:20.360
She's playing with me.

14:20.393 --> 14:22.662
She? Carmen?

14:22.695 --> 14:24.531
Marcos, you're dealing
with Carmen? Are you insane?

14:24.564 --> 14:26.733
This is Lorna's only chance.
I can handle it.

14:26.766 --> 14:29.436
I just have to...

14:32.439 --> 14:35.075
-Give it back.
-Come and get it.

14:35.108 --> 14:38.178
What are you, 12?

14:38.211 --> 14:41.614
-I need the information.
-We were good together.

14:41.648 --> 14:45.052
You and me.

14:45.085 --> 14:47.955
Why didn't we work out?

14:47.988 --> 14:50.057
We cared about different things.

14:50.090 --> 14:52.725
I cared
about taking care of my family.

14:52.759 --> 14:54.561
A family you were a part of

14:54.594 --> 14:56.429
before you ran off
to go play hero.

14:56.463 --> 14:59.199
And I was fine with the family.
It was the business.

14:59.232 --> 15:00.968
Is it so different
from what you're doing now?

15:01.001 --> 15:02.402
Moving drugs from Mexico,

15:02.435 --> 15:04.104
moving mutants to Mexico.

15:04.137 --> 15:05.772
These days,
which one is more illegal?

15:05.805 --> 15:07.174
-You can't...
-MAN: Excuse me.

15:08.976 --> 15:10.477
(man whispering)

15:12.345 --> 15:16.416
Look, I need a time
for the convoy.

15:16.449 --> 15:18.485
-What do you want from me?
-What do I want?

15:21.088 --> 15:24.657
These hands.

15:24.691 --> 15:27.160
These talented hands.

15:35.969 --> 15:38.905
Eclipse found out that a convoy
of military vehicles

15:38.938 --> 15:41.941
is taking Lorna and Reed
to a military airport.

15:41.975 --> 15:44.978
Now, based on the route,
the best place to hit it

15:45.012 --> 15:47.180
is gonna be an old warehouse
district off Peachtree.

15:47.214 --> 15:50.917
Can you open a portal, get us
inside the transport bus?

15:50.950 --> 15:54.187
Well, if the driver can see out,
then I can see in, but if

15:54.221 --> 15:58.591
the bus is moving,
then it can get messy real fast.

15:58.625 --> 16:01.661
-Stop the bus-- not gonna be
easy. -Maybe Marcos can, like,

16:01.694 --> 16:03.997
-melt the tires. -DREAMER: When
is he getting us the time frame

16:04.031 --> 16:06.799
for the convoy?
He's been gone a while, Johnny.

16:06.833 --> 16:08.968
And he will be back.
He's working on it now.

16:09.002 --> 16:11.104
Okay, regardless,
melting their tires

16:11.138 --> 16:14.041
with lasers is hardly subtle.

16:14.074 --> 16:16.209
What do you think happens
after that?

16:16.243 --> 16:17.677
A pitched battle. People die.

16:17.710 --> 16:19.979
Our goal isn't just
to get Reed and Lorna.

16:20.013 --> 16:21.714
-It's to get them alive.
-THUNDERBIRD: She's right.

16:21.748 --> 16:24.151
Our job is to get in and out
without dropping bodies.

16:24.184 --> 16:25.985
We need another way
to stop that bus.

16:33.160 --> 16:34.394
(music playing over headphones)

16:34.427 --> 16:35.595
Hey.

16:36.696 --> 16:38.031
Hey.

16:38.065 --> 16:40.467
-I need to talk to you.
-About what?

16:40.500 --> 16:42.769
We need to figure out a safe way
to stop a prison truck.

16:44.037 --> 16:47.006
Can you... break a truck wheel?

16:47.040 --> 16:48.975
You did that thing
with the parking meter.

16:49.008 --> 16:50.710
No. You mean meters.

16:50.743 --> 16:52.645
I meant to break one.

16:52.679 --> 16:55.182
Look, it's not exactly precise,

16:55.215 --> 16:58.718
okay? I could tear the whole
truck apart with Dad in it.

16:58.751 --> 17:02.222
Get up. I want to try something.

17:02.255 --> 17:06.526
Maybe we could use what I do
to, like, focus what you do.

17:06.559 --> 17:08.095
I don't follow.

17:08.128 --> 17:09.762
Forget it. Just...

17:11.064 --> 17:12.565
Okay.

17:12.599 --> 17:14.534
Do the lamppost.

17:14.567 --> 17:15.868
ANDY:
Okay.

17:15.902 --> 17:17.337
You're the one getting
in trouble

17:17.370 --> 17:19.406
if I tear everything apart,
okay?

17:25.245 --> 17:29.116
(rattling and rumbling)

17:29.149 --> 17:31.418
(grunting)

17:32.652 --> 17:33.720
(Lauren grunts)

17:37.090 --> 17:41.228
(both exhaling)

17:43.330 --> 17:46.299
(creaking)

17:47.500 --> 17:50.137
-(collar buzzes)
-(winces)

17:56.409 --> 18:01.314
I know I'm probably not someone
you want to talk to.

18:01.348 --> 18:04.217
You're right about that.

18:04.251 --> 18:05.818
I always told myself that anyone

18:05.852 --> 18:09.122
that was facing me
in my courtroom was guilty.

18:11.691 --> 18:14.794
Told myself
that I was the prosecutor,

18:14.827 --> 18:16.263
and that the laws were clear,

18:16.296 --> 18:18.131
and if you broke 'em,
it was on you.

18:18.165 --> 18:22.269
Told myself
that I was doing my job.

18:24.804 --> 18:27.774
Then I found out that...

18:27.807 --> 18:31.110
my kids are mutants.

18:33.780 --> 18:37.150
They didn't mean to hurt anyone.

18:37.184 --> 18:39.118
They didn't mean to do anything.

18:39.152 --> 18:41.488
They were just
defending themselves.

18:45.692 --> 18:48.027
But they broke the law.

18:50.730 --> 18:56.369
And with mandatory minimums,
they'll get at least ten years.

18:56.403 --> 18:58.137
Maybe more.

18:58.171 --> 19:01.608
And a few days ago,
I would have been the one

19:01.641 --> 19:03.376
making that argument.

19:03.410 --> 19:07.146
Before all of this,

19:07.180 --> 19:10.049
I didn't understand.

19:11.184 --> 19:13.152
But I do now.

19:15.388 --> 19:17.724
And I'm sorry.

19:22.595 --> 19:25.465
Congratulations...

19:25.498 --> 19:28.568
on figuring out
you're one of the bad guys.

19:29.902 --> 19:33.540
But so what?

19:33.573 --> 19:36.543
If you would have thought
about it a little longer,

19:36.576 --> 19:38.878
you wouldn't have destroyed
so many lives?

19:38.911 --> 19:42.715
Huh? Do you want forgiveness?

19:42.749 --> 19:44.584
Ask the little boy

19:44.617 --> 19:47.720
who I strapped into a bus
while he screamed,

19:47.754 --> 19:51.190
begging to join his mommy
in prison where you sent her.

19:51.224 --> 19:55.328
You know what? Ask the hundreds
of families whose lives

19:55.362 --> 19:58.931
you and your friends ruined.

20:00.567 --> 20:03.135
Don't ask me.

20:12.211 --> 20:14.113
(sighs)

20:21.654 --> 20:24.056
-Wow.
-Right?

20:24.090 --> 20:25.091
THUNDERBIRD:
That was pretty cool.

20:25.124 --> 20:27.126
Yeah, more like incredible.

20:27.159 --> 20:29.396
You guys think you can do that
at a longer range?

20:29.429 --> 20:31.230
Yeah, definitely.
Anything you need.

20:31.264 --> 20:32.632
LAUREN:
The best part is no one will see

20:32.665 --> 20:34.401
-where it came from, so...
-No.

20:36.002 --> 20:38.204
Kids are-are not
attacking a convoy.

20:38.237 --> 20:40.407
We don't have a good
alternative here, Caitlin.

20:40.440 --> 20:41.974
We're running out of time.

20:42.008 --> 20:44.076
What, so you're gonna use
child soldiers now?

20:44.110 --> 20:47.046
-We're not kids like that
anymore, Mom. -I said no.

20:47.079 --> 20:49.549
-(Andy sighs)
-Mom, please.

20:49.582 --> 20:52.385
I know you're scared.
I'm scared, too.

20:52.419 --> 20:54.287
But think about what you said
last night.

20:54.321 --> 20:57.457
About how sometimes
we have to take risks.

20:57.490 --> 20:59.626
Really?

20:59.659 --> 21:01.794
You're gonna use my own words
against me?

21:01.828 --> 21:05.264
Look, this isn't going
to visit your Uncle Daniel.

21:05.298 --> 21:07.567
This is about trained men
with guns.

21:07.600 --> 21:10.570
We want to fight for this.
You always said

21:10.603 --> 21:12.572
that there are things worth
fighting for.

21:12.605 --> 21:14.441
Was that all just talk?

21:16.309 --> 21:18.845
You said it yourself--

21:18.878 --> 21:21.213
there are risks worth taking.

21:28.187 --> 21:32.659
If I say okay,
I can't have them in harm's way.

21:32.692 --> 21:34.627
We just need them
to stop the bus.

21:34.661 --> 21:37.063
They get out of there
as soon as that's done.

21:41.033 --> 21:43.336
Okay.

21:54.981 --> 21:56.616
ECLIPSE: We've been out
all night. Where are we going?

21:56.649 --> 21:58.585
CARMEN: I just want your help
with a little project.

22:02.855 --> 22:04.891
Carmen, what the hell?

22:04.924 --> 22:08.395
Oh, please. Don't act like
you haven't seen this before.

22:08.428 --> 22:10.830
You used to hate this kind of
thing. You begged your father...

22:10.863 --> 22:14.401
I was a child.
I protect my people.

22:14.434 --> 22:17.670
You think you're better
than all this, I know.

22:17.704 --> 22:22.274
But you're not so different
from me... Eclipse.

22:25.111 --> 22:27.380
This maldito stole two kilos

22:27.414 --> 22:28.715
from our distro centers.

22:28.748 --> 22:30.917
He needs to tell us
where they are.

22:30.950 --> 22:34.587
Fortunately, you and your hands
are very persuasive.

22:34.621 --> 22:36.556
Carmen, this isn't me anymore.

22:36.589 --> 22:38.691
I've changed, okay?
You've got people who do

22:38.725 --> 22:40.660
-this sort of thing for you.
-Yes, but I'm asking you.

22:40.693 --> 22:42.562
Do you want
to save the girl's life or not?

22:42.595 --> 22:44.531
-Yes, but this... -I'm not
a child anymore, Marcos.

22:44.564 --> 22:47.434
I'm a businesswoman.

22:47.467 --> 22:49.101
And I don't pull strings for men

22:49.135 --> 22:51.938
just because I used to be
stupid in love with them.

22:51.971 --> 22:53.906
You think the price
is flirting with me

22:53.940 --> 22:56.342
in my own club
while you drink my tequila?

22:56.375 --> 22:58.210
The price is you.

22:58.244 --> 23:01.614
So from now on,
I call, you come,

23:01.648 --> 23:04.751
and you do
exactly what I ask you to do.

23:10.490 --> 23:14.293
He can't talk
with that thing in his mouth.

23:28.775 --> 23:30.743
Just tell her
what she wants, man.

23:30.777 --> 23:32.579
We don't have to do this.

23:34.447 --> 23:36.382
No, we don't.

23:36.415 --> 23:39.051
Why don't you just let me go?

23:39.085 --> 23:40.753
'Cause I don't know nothing.

23:48.961 --> 23:51.263
I want you to think
about your eyes.

23:51.297 --> 23:52.932
This here?

23:52.965 --> 23:55.668
This is bright enough
to blind you forever.

23:55.702 --> 23:57.436
Eyes open, closed...

23:57.470 --> 23:59.205
doesn't matter.

24:02.842 --> 24:04.110
So, do you want to spend

24:04.143 --> 24:06.513
the rest of your life
in the dark?

24:06.546 --> 24:09.982
Or do you want to tell the lady
what she wants?

24:10.016 --> 24:12.619
(grunting)

24:12.652 --> 24:15.254
Stop, stop!

24:15.287 --> 24:16.623
It's in my cousin's garage, man.

24:16.656 --> 24:18.224
I swear.

24:20.192 --> 24:21.427
You changed, huh?

24:21.460 --> 24:22.695
Juan will give you
what you want.

24:22.729 --> 24:23.830
I'll be in touch.

24:23.863 --> 24:25.832
I hope the whore is worth it.

24:27.967 --> 24:30.703
(grunts)

24:40.547 --> 24:41.881
THUNDERBIRD:
There you are.

24:41.914 --> 24:43.382
I was about to go looking
for you.

24:43.415 --> 24:44.951
Prison convoy
leaves at 10:00 a.m. tomorrow.

24:44.984 --> 24:46.352
They sweep the route at 9:30.

24:46.385 --> 24:48.621
-We have a half hour window
to set up. -Hey.

24:48.655 --> 24:51.558
Hey. How did it go?

24:51.591 --> 24:52.825
With Carmen.

24:52.859 --> 24:54.326
Uh, it was fine.

24:54.360 --> 24:55.828
She was happy to help.

24:55.862 --> 24:58.464
Look, you can talk to me, man.

24:58.497 --> 25:00.166
All right? I don't want you
to get caught back up...

25:00.199 --> 25:02.569
I did what I had to do. Okay?

25:02.602 --> 25:04.503
So, back off.

25:04.537 --> 25:08.340
We leave first thing
in the morning.

25:08.374 --> 25:11.077
*

25:28.460 --> 25:30.396
(Eclipse speaking Spanish)

25:40.740 --> 25:44.310
* I was filled

25:45.444 --> 25:47.413
* You made

25:47.446 --> 25:51.918
* My bones still

25:51.951 --> 25:55.755
* Your eyes well

25:55.788 --> 25:58.625
* With tears

25:58.658 --> 26:01.928
* We're alive

26:01.961 --> 26:04.964
* My dear

26:04.997 --> 26:09.468
* My... *

26:09.501 --> 26:11.370
* Since we found out

26:11.403 --> 26:15.374
* That we're invincible

26:15.407 --> 26:18.277
* We've been living

26:18.310 --> 26:19.545
* In a dream world

26:19.578 --> 26:20.680
Please.

26:22.248 --> 26:24.784
* Since we decided

26:24.817 --> 26:28.587
* To be infinite

26:28.621 --> 26:31.490
* There's no ending

26:31.523 --> 26:33.893
* And there's no fear

26:33.926 --> 26:36.128
* No fear

26:36.162 --> 26:38.130
* No fear, no fear

26:39.298 --> 26:41.500
* No fear

26:41.533 --> 26:43.169
* No, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no *

26:43.202 --> 26:44.804
* No fear, no fear

26:44.837 --> 26:46.238
* No fear

26:46.272 --> 26:49.108
* No, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no *

26:49.141 --> 26:52.578
* No fear, no fear

26:52.611 --> 26:54.013
* No fear

26:54.046 --> 26:55.782
* No, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no *

26:55.815 --> 26:57.616
* No fear

26:57.650 --> 27:00.720
* No fear, no fear.

27:03.155 --> 27:04.556
(engine running)

27:12.699 --> 27:15.802
THUNDERBIRD: Convoy's
gonna be coming down this road.

27:15.835 --> 27:17.704
We should be able to see
inside the transport bus

27:17.737 --> 27:19.338
from right here.

27:19.371 --> 27:20.807
Is this all right?

27:20.840 --> 27:22.541
It's great.

27:22.574 --> 27:25.111
Are you all right?

27:25.144 --> 27:26.345
I'm also great.

27:26.378 --> 27:27.780
Just, uh,

27:27.814 --> 27:29.348
haven't been sleeping
really well.

27:29.381 --> 27:30.717
Yeah, well,

27:30.750 --> 27:32.318
living at the headquarters,

27:32.351 --> 27:34.153
people coming and going,
that could be an adjustment.

27:34.186 --> 27:36.022
(scoffs) Yeah, well, anything's
better than jail, right?

27:37.389 --> 27:38.624
What about you?

27:38.657 --> 27:40.492
Was it hard for you at first?

27:40.526 --> 27:42.661
It was almost impossible.

27:42.695 --> 27:44.463
-Really?
-Yeah.

27:44.496 --> 27:48.901
You seem so--
I don't know-- soldier-y.

27:48.935 --> 27:51.670
Wouldn't think that anything
was hard for you.

27:51.704 --> 27:53.039
At first
it was just me and Polaris

27:53.072 --> 27:54.206
and this impossible task,

27:54.240 --> 27:56.375
you know?

27:56.408 --> 27:59.111
You ever think
about walking away?

28:00.246 --> 28:02.248
All the time.

28:02.281 --> 28:04.350
What's stopping you?

28:04.383 --> 28:06.719
What we're doing here.

28:06.753 --> 28:08.988
This is important to me.

28:09.021 --> 28:10.556
But everybody
finds their own reason

28:10.589 --> 28:12.725
to stay.

28:17.696 --> 28:20.399
I just have to ask.

28:20.432 --> 28:23.002
The night that we first met...

28:23.035 --> 28:26.906
did we go outside together
or something?

28:26.939 --> 28:30.276
No. Uh, we-we did not.

28:30.309 --> 28:33.179
Right. That's what I thought.

28:33.212 --> 28:35.782
You know, I'd remember
if we went outside

28:35.815 --> 28:37.216
and then came back in.

28:51.330 --> 28:54.133
(breathing heavily)

28:57.970 --> 29:00.439
Here, let me help.

29:00.472 --> 29:02.074
(exhales) Thanks.

29:02.108 --> 29:04.743
Getting some medical supplies
ready, just in case.

29:04.777 --> 29:06.412
It's weird
how quiet everything is.

29:06.445 --> 29:08.915
LAUREN:
Not really. It's Sunday.

29:10.016 --> 29:12.318
It's Sunday.

29:12.351 --> 29:14.987
You okay, honey?

29:15.021 --> 29:16.755
Yeah.

29:16.789 --> 29:20.459
The football team's
fund-raiser breakfast

29:20.492 --> 29:22.161
was this morning.

29:22.194 --> 29:25.297
(chuckles) I was supposed
to make corn muffins.

29:27.633 --> 29:30.136
This isn't corn muffins.

29:40.446 --> 29:41.814
ECLIPSE:
Before this goes down,

29:41.848 --> 29:43.482
there's something
we got to talk about.

29:43.515 --> 29:45.852
Listen, guys,
if things go wrong...

29:45.885 --> 29:48.654
We got it. We take off,
regroup at the rendezvous...

29:48.687 --> 29:50.990
No. Listen, if things go wrong,
I'm not leaving.

29:51.023 --> 29:53.359
Wait, what? We discussed this.

29:53.392 --> 29:55.794
I know what we discussed.
But Sage was right.

29:55.828 --> 29:57.429
I have no right dragging you
into a suicide mission.

29:57.463 --> 29:58.630
If things go sideways,
you guys go.

29:58.664 --> 30:00.332
-What about you?
-(sighs)

30:00.366 --> 30:02.401
I'm not leaving here
without Lorna.

30:14.480 --> 30:16.682
Hey.

30:16.715 --> 30:18.084
They're coming.

30:23.890 --> 30:25.157
This is it.

30:36.368 --> 30:38.637
LAUREN:
Andy, go!

30:38.670 --> 30:40.973
Okay, I can't do it.

30:41.007 --> 30:42.508
What do you mean,
you can't do it?

30:42.541 --> 30:43.742
-You have to.
-I-It's... I don't know.

30:43.775 --> 30:45.011
It's moving.
It's just different.

30:45.044 --> 30:47.346
ECLIPSE:
Why hasn't the bus stopped?

30:47.379 --> 30:50.649
It's not stopping.

30:50.682 --> 30:52.484
CAITLIN: You can do this.
We believe in you.

30:52.518 --> 30:54.653
-It's not what we practiced.
-Okay, just-just calm down.

30:54.686 --> 30:57.256
-I'm trying.
-Mom, stop babying him. -Lauren?

30:57.289 --> 30:58.424
Hey, you're the reason
we're in this mess,

30:58.457 --> 30:59.758
and now you can't even help us
get out.

30:59.791 --> 31:00.927
-What are you doing?
-Back off!

31:00.960 --> 31:02.094
Maybe those bullies were right.

31:02.128 --> 31:03.429
Maybe you are nothing.

31:03.462 --> 31:05.864
If they're wrong, then prove it.

31:17.043 --> 31:18.044
Sorry.

31:18.077 --> 31:19.946
You're better when you're angry.

31:19.979 --> 31:21.247
Look, we can argue later.

31:21.280 --> 31:23.082
We need to move.

31:23.115 --> 31:24.283
TRADER:
Was that the bus?

31:24.316 --> 31:26.118
ECLIPSE:
It sounded like it.

31:26.152 --> 31:27.119
I think so.

31:27.153 --> 31:28.587
It's in the wrong place.
This is bad.

31:42.568 --> 31:44.203
Listen to me just this once.

31:44.236 --> 31:45.904
I know you hate me,
and that's fine,

31:45.938 --> 31:47.706
but there's obviously
something wrong with the bus.

31:47.739 --> 31:49.875
OFFICER:
Officer requesting backup.

31:49.908 --> 31:53.579
And if we're gonna get a chance,
it's gonna come along soon.

31:53.612 --> 31:55.281
Look, think about it.

31:55.314 --> 31:56.815
Is your hate for me

31:56.848 --> 31:59.651
worth more than giving
your child a real life?

31:59.685 --> 32:01.453
(sighs)

32:01.487 --> 32:02.921
OFFICER:
Can I get a 20 on backup?

32:02.955 --> 32:04.890
Look, all I ask is this:

32:04.923 --> 32:07.960
if we get the chance,
help me take it.

32:07.994 --> 32:10.596
(officer speaking indistinctly
in distance)

32:16.668 --> 32:19.071
-Why didn't the bus stop in
the right place? -I don't know.

32:19.105 --> 32:20.572
It doesn't matter now.
Let's find it.

32:20.606 --> 32:21.807
(screams)

32:24.443 --> 32:26.812
Damn. Okay.

32:28.480 --> 32:30.316
DRIVER:
The axle snapped.

32:30.349 --> 32:31.650
I don't know how
that could have happened.

32:31.683 --> 32:33.285
Damn it. It's mutants.

32:33.319 --> 32:34.987
Could be.
Could be it's just mechanical.

32:35.021 --> 32:36.955
It's mutants.
Lock it down right now.

32:36.989 --> 32:39.725
All right. Lock it down.
Lock it down.

32:46.665 --> 32:48.300
-DREAMER: What's happening?
-ECLIPSE: I don't know.

32:48.334 --> 32:50.202
They're moving
into defensive positions.

32:50.236 --> 32:52.838
You guys have to go now.
Sentinel Services

32:52.871 --> 32:54.206
are gonna sweep the area.
They're gonna find these cars,

32:54.240 --> 32:55.607
and if they do,
we have no way to get out.

32:55.641 --> 32:56.975
All the more reason
for us to stay.

32:57.009 --> 32:58.510
I'll see what's happening
at the bus.

32:58.544 --> 32:59.811
Now, look, there's a lot
of people out there.

32:59.845 --> 33:01.313
Are you sure
you can fool them all?

33:01.347 --> 33:02.981
I used to sneak
into mutant detention camps.

33:03.015 --> 33:06.652
If they didn't see me then,
they won't see me now.

33:06.685 --> 33:08.920
Be careful.

33:19.731 --> 33:21.967
Up here.

33:22.000 --> 33:24.370
(Blink grunts)

33:24.403 --> 33:27.506
Whoa. Okay.

33:27.539 --> 33:29.575
THUNDERBIRD: Can you portal us
into that bus from here?

33:29.608 --> 33:30.909
BLINK:
Yeah.

33:34.012 --> 33:35.514
Whoa.

33:35.547 --> 33:37.015
You okay?

33:37.049 --> 33:38.684
Yeah, I just felt something
weird there.

33:38.717 --> 33:40.352
Yeah, I felt it, too.

33:42.221 --> 33:45.357
It's not working. Something's
interfering with the portal.

33:45.391 --> 33:46.558
Let me see what's going on.

33:46.592 --> 33:48.394
You're clear?
All right, here.

33:51.563 --> 33:53.865
(sighs)
I can't track.

33:53.899 --> 33:55.767
What's happening?

33:55.801 --> 33:58.036
-No, it's impossible.
-What's impossible?

33:59.138 --> 34:01.307
Come on.

34:02.808 --> 34:05.511
MAN:
All right, just keep searching.

34:05.544 --> 34:07.713
-They're pretty sure there's
something going on here. -Copy.

34:09.315 --> 34:11.049
Contact!

34:11.083 --> 34:12.618
You, on the ground!

34:13.652 --> 34:15.421
I said on the ground. Now!

34:21.293 --> 34:23.095
Fall back and regroup.

34:23.129 --> 34:24.263
No! No!

34:27.666 --> 34:30.402
What are you doing?

34:30.436 --> 34:32.304
The only thing I've ever known

34:32.338 --> 34:34.240
that can disrupt mutant
abilities like that is...

34:35.907 --> 34:37.843
Is what?

34:40.646 --> 34:42.614
Not what.

34:44.082 --> 34:45.484
Who.

34:45.517 --> 34:47.153
(sighs)

34:47.186 --> 34:49.788
You're saying that guy out there
is what's messing us up?

34:49.821 --> 34:51.723
His name is Pulse.
He has the power

34:51.757 --> 34:54.393
-to disrupt systems, shut down
electronics. -What does

34:54.426 --> 34:56.962
-that have to do with us?
-He can also disrupt mutants.

34:56.995 --> 35:00.098
He can suppress abilities for...
at least two blocks.

35:00.132 --> 35:02.468
And he's working with them?

35:02.501 --> 35:03.635
Not when I knew him.

35:04.603 --> 35:06.438
He was my best friend.

35:06.472 --> 35:08.174
I thought I saw him die

35:08.207 --> 35:10.442
on an attack at a Sentinel
Services Relocation Center.

35:10.476 --> 35:13.412
Looks like
you're wrong about that.

35:13.445 --> 35:16.182
I got to get to him.
I got to stop him.

35:16.215 --> 35:18.984
Go check on the others.
I got to get out there.

35:23.389 --> 35:25.123
(panting)

35:25.157 --> 35:26.958
DREAMER: What the hell?!
We talked about this.

35:26.992 --> 35:29.295
-We're not here to drop bodies.
-Yeah, well, it looks like they

35:29.328 --> 35:31.663
didn't get the memo. I'll draw
the fire, you try to save him.

35:31.697 --> 35:34.500
-Go, go, go. -(gunfire)
-Take cover!

35:41.173 --> 35:43.242
(gunfire continues)

35:48.914 --> 35:50.649
(gunfire)

35:52.518 --> 35:54.720
-(gasps)
-LAUREN: Mom, they're shooting.

35:54.753 --> 35:57.656
If Dad's out there...

35:57.689 --> 35:58.990
We're getting out of here,
you understand?

35:59.024 --> 36:01.727
ANDY:
That's our car.

36:01.760 --> 36:03.362
-That's our car.
-CAITLIN (whispers): Stop.

36:04.430 --> 36:06.064
Maybe I can...

36:08.434 --> 36:12.170
-Mom, it's not working.
-It's okay. -What?

36:12.204 --> 36:14.540
What-what do you mean?
What are we gonna do?

36:16.608 --> 36:18.210
Yeah, we got some kind
of vehicle here.

36:18.244 --> 36:19.878
Gray SUV with nobody in it.

36:19.911 --> 36:22.414
We got... (grunts)

36:26.352 --> 36:27.553
Here are the keys.

36:27.586 --> 36:29.187
Take the car and go.

36:29.221 --> 36:31.323
-What about you?
-I'm going after your father.

36:31.357 --> 36:32.991
-We're not gonna leave you.
-We can't go by ourselves.

36:33.024 --> 36:35.827
I am not losing the two of you.

36:35.861 --> 36:37.195
I will find him,
and we will meet you

36:37.229 --> 36:40.832
at the headquarters,
but I need you to go now.

36:40.866 --> 36:43.101
Mom.

36:43.134 --> 36:44.770
I love you.

36:44.803 --> 36:47.105
I love you so much.

36:50.108 --> 36:52.511
-Lauren, what if she...?
-No.

36:52.544 --> 36:53.912
Don't say it.

36:57.115 --> 36:58.684
(engine starts)

36:58.717 --> 37:01.119
WEEKS:
You were right.

37:01.152 --> 37:02.788
-Shots fired up the street.
-How many hostiles?

37:02.821 --> 37:04.122
Not sure yet.
At least three.

37:04.155 --> 37:05.591
-(gunfire)
-All teams maintain positions.

37:05.624 --> 37:07.593
Look for more hostiles.

37:07.626 --> 37:08.794
We got to move these prisoners.

37:08.827 --> 37:09.895
We're out of here
in five minutes.

37:09.928 --> 37:11.297
(gunfire)

37:14.733 --> 37:16.234
WEEKS (over radio): Move the
prisoners to a secure location.

37:16.268 --> 37:18.003
Copy that.
We're moving 'em.

37:19.271 --> 37:20.672
(distant gunfire)

37:24.976 --> 37:26.312
Is there a problem, Officer?

37:26.345 --> 37:28.213
You sure they're safe to...?

37:28.246 --> 37:30.215
It's fine. Just get it off.

37:30.248 --> 37:31.750
She can't do anything anyway,
all right?

37:31.783 --> 37:34.320
All the muties in the area
are shut down. We'll get

37:34.353 --> 37:35.587
a portable on her
when we get 'em...

37:35.621 --> 37:38.123
(grunting)

37:43.128 --> 37:44.262
Aah!

37:45.331 --> 37:47.533
(gunfire continues)

37:50.001 --> 37:51.870
(grunting)

37:58.043 --> 37:59.311
(grunting)

37:59.345 --> 38:01.079
Leave her alone!

38:01.112 --> 38:04.483
-(groaning) -You like that?
You got any other ideas?

38:04.516 --> 38:06.652
(gunfire continues)

38:07.719 --> 38:08.787
(grunts)

38:08.820 --> 38:11.423
(gunfire)

38:11.457 --> 38:14.793
No, no, no. Come on. Come on.

38:14.826 --> 38:16.662
(yelling)

38:16.695 --> 38:18.630
(panting)

38:32.711 --> 38:34.346
Come on! Come on, please!

38:36.181 --> 38:37.649
(grunting)

38:58.269 --> 39:00.706
(both grunt)

39:00.739 --> 39:02.574
Pulse, it's me.

39:02.608 --> 39:04.109
It's John.

39:06.878 --> 39:09.581
(groans)

39:11.517 --> 39:14.786
(yelling)

39:17.222 --> 39:18.557
GUARD:
Where's my backup?

39:18.590 --> 39:20.158
We got prisoners
resisting in here.

39:20.191 --> 39:21.693
-JACE (on radio): Are they
secure? -Yes, my partner is out.

39:21.727 --> 39:24.162
-What? What is it? -JACE: We're
containing the area. Stand by.

39:24.195 --> 39:25.697
I can feel my powers.
They're back.

39:25.731 --> 39:27.065
Could you get us loose?

39:27.098 --> 39:28.700
No, there's nothing
in here I can use.

39:28.734 --> 39:30.869
It's-it's all plastic.
Everything metal is outside.

39:30.902 --> 39:32.738
Requesting backup on the bus.

39:32.771 --> 39:34.773
Repeat,
officer requesting backup.

39:34.806 --> 39:36.608
(panting)

39:41.980 --> 39:44.516
Prisoners are no longer secure,

39:44.550 --> 39:47.285
-and I've got a man down.
-My leg.

39:47.318 --> 39:49.387
The metal screw in my leg.

39:49.421 --> 39:51.890
-What?
-Take it.

39:53.892 --> 39:55.393
Take it.

39:55.427 --> 39:57.095
GUARD:
I need backup now!

40:03.435 --> 40:06.137
(screaming)

40:10.008 --> 40:12.478
-(grunts) -The area's
no longer secure. I repeat,

40:12.511 --> 40:14.345
-the area's no longer secure.
-(grunts)

40:17.449 --> 40:19.651
Dios te salve, Maria.

40:19.685 --> 40:21.487
(grunting)

40:43.642 --> 40:45.511
-Come on, come on.
-(groaning)

40:48.046 --> 40:50.348
Hurry!

40:50.381 --> 40:53.752
-You okay?
-Yeah. Better now.

40:53.785 --> 40:56.454
-You're bleeding?
-I'll explain later.

40:56.488 --> 40:58.156
-Look, we got to get out of
here. -No, no, I'm not leaving.

40:58.189 --> 41:00.091
Sentinel Services is gonna have
reinforcements coming in.

41:00.125 --> 41:01.727
John, I'm not leaving
without Lorna.

41:04.295 --> 41:06.498
The mutants have
their powers back!

41:06.532 --> 41:07.933
All teams shoot to kill now.

41:07.966 --> 41:09.568
Now! All teams shoot to kill.

41:14.305 --> 41:15.206
Come on.

41:18.877 --> 41:21.412
(metallic creaking)

41:33.859 --> 41:35.026
(shouting indistinctly)

41:39.097 --> 41:40.866
Looks like she's doing just fine
without you.

41:40.899 --> 41:43.835
Fall back. Fall back.

41:46.104 --> 41:48.073
Hey. Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

41:48.106 --> 41:50.809
Oh. How did you find us?

41:50.842 --> 41:52.243
It really doesn't matter now.

41:56.682 --> 41:58.917
Come on, get in!

41:58.950 --> 42:00.752
-Come on.
-Come on. -Go.

42:00.786 --> 42:01.720
Reed.

42:04.422 --> 42:06.758
Reed.

42:06.792 --> 42:10.328
-It's okay. It's okay.
-Get in. -Oh, my God.

42:10.361 --> 42:14.165
-Let's go.
-Go. Go, come on. Come on, go.

42:14.199 --> 42:17.869
(tires screeching)

42:20.205 --> 42:21.472
Go!

42:24.075 --> 42:26.778
-Damn it! Go after 'em.
-They're out in the open now.

42:26.812 --> 42:29.948
-We'll get 'em.
-I don't just want them!

42:29.981 --> 42:31.717
Shut down every safe house,
every sympathizer,

42:31.750 --> 42:33.885
anyone who's ever helped 'em.

42:33.919 --> 42:35.486
I want them all.
