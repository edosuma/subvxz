WEBVTT

00:07.703 --> 00:09.183
Thank you
for coming over early

00:09.226 --> 00:11.185
to help make Chinese New Year
dinner, Elaine.

00:11.228 --> 00:12.316
Oh, my pleasure.

00:12.360 --> 00:14.710
We've never had
a Chinese family in Orlando

00:14.753 --> 00:16.277
to spend this holiday with,

00:16.320 --> 00:18.279
so I'm going all out --

00:18.322 --> 00:20.629
long life noodles,
lion-head meatballs,

00:20.672 --> 00:22.979
sautéed beef,
and the whole steamed fish.

00:23.023 --> 00:24.067
Oh.

00:24.111 --> 00:25.068
Is eating the fish eye

00:25.112 --> 00:26.678
also a big deal
in your family?

00:26.722 --> 00:28.115
Of course.

00:28.158 --> 00:30.204
One slimy eyeball
is a small price to pay

00:30.247 --> 00:32.293
for an entire year
of good fortune.

00:32.336 --> 00:34.947
With my mother-in-law,
it's fun to put up a fight,

00:34.991 --> 00:37.950
but it always goes to her
because she's the oldest.

00:37.994 --> 00:40.083
Well, in my household,
it's never a fight,

00:40.127 --> 00:42.085
because Ialways get
the fish eye.

00:42.129 --> 00:44.696
Okay, these dumplings
are done.

00:44.740 --> 00:47.090
I put carrots in them because
it's the Year of the Rabbit.

00:47.134 --> 00:48.439
Aww, cute.

00:48.483 --> 00:49.875
Oh.

00:49.919 --> 00:51.312
Those are dumplings?

00:51.355 --> 00:52.530
No one taught me
how to make them,

00:52.574 --> 00:53.749
so I taught myself.

00:53.792 --> 00:55.794
It is
a one-handed technique

00:55.838 --> 00:58.188
I call the clump-and-dump.

01:00.408 --> 01:01.452
They're not the prettiest,

01:01.496 --> 01:03.106
but I can knock them out
real fast,

01:03.150 --> 01:04.586
and I've never heard
any complaints.

01:04.629 --> 01:05.761
Grandma: Oh.

No, Elaine, actually,
she is terrible.

01:44.278 --> 01:44.974
Hmm.

01:45.017 --> 01:46.497
My mother-in-law and I

01:46.541 --> 01:48.195
have a very bumpy
relationship,

01:48.238 --> 01:50.371
especially
on Chinese New Year.

01:50.414 --> 01:53.025
I do all the work,
and she ruins things.

01:53.069 --> 01:54.244
You see this wrinkle?

01:55.550 --> 01:58.161
That's from
the Year of the Horse.

01:58.205 --> 02:01.556
I don't see anything.Well, that is because
my skin is perfect,

02:01.599 --> 02:03.601
but trust me,
it is there.

02:04.602 --> 02:06.213
I guess that's just the way
it is with mothers-in-law.

02:06.256 --> 02:07.518
You get it.

02:07.562 --> 02:10.391
Actually, I have a great
relationship with mine.

02:11.392 --> 02:14.438
Oh, that's a good one.

02:14.482 --> 02:16.005
And they say
women aren't funny.

02:16.048 --> 02:17.441
No, really.

02:17.485 --> 02:20.357
Okay, my mother-in-law and I
used to argue all the time

02:20.401 --> 02:23.665
until we discovered
we both love Colin Firth.

02:23.708 --> 02:26.102
Oh, is he the white one
with the brown hair?

02:26.668 --> 02:30.237
Mm.
The key was
to build a bridge,

02:30.280 --> 02:32.761
which we did over
a well-worn LaserDisc

02:32.804 --> 02:34.371
of "Pride and Prejudice."

02:34.415 --> 02:36.330
It would be nice
to have a Chinese New Year

02:36.373 --> 02:37.983
she didn't
clump and dump on.

02:38.027 --> 02:39.246
Well, let me help.

02:39.289 --> 02:41.596
I mean, we've got hours
till dinner.

02:41.639 --> 02:43.032
Oh.

02:43.075 --> 02:44.425
I see that wrinkle now.

02:44.468 --> 02:46.296
No, you don't.

02:46.818 --> 02:49.647
All right, boys. Turn off the TV
and clean up that blanket.

02:49.691 --> 02:51.780
Blanket? That's me.

02:51.823 --> 02:53.999
Oh.
Didn't see you there, Emery.

02:54.043 --> 02:55.305
Cozy.

02:55.349 --> 02:56.567
The rest of the Lee family
is almost here.

02:56.611 --> 02:57.786
We need to make
a good impression.

02:57.829 --> 03:00.354
He means get your burps
and farts out now.

03:00.397 --> 03:03.008
This is why
you're still single, Eddie.

03:03.052 --> 03:04.488
Guys, save the insults
for tomorrow.

03:04.532 --> 03:05.446
No fighting today.

03:08.275 --> 03:09.363
Would it have killed you

03:09.406 --> 03:10.929
to just sit shotgun
on the way over, Dad?

03:10.973 --> 03:12.931
I was sitting in a cab.

03:12.975 --> 03:14.498
It was my cab!
I was driving.

03:14.542 --> 03:16.892
And I was off-duty.When I'm in a cab,
I sit in the back.

03:16.935 --> 03:18.720
Uh, Julius, Horace.

03:18.763 --> 03:20.896
Come in, come in.
Meet my boys.

03:21.940 --> 03:23.681
This is my oldest, Eddie.

03:23.725 --> 03:25.857
He just got
his driver's license.

03:25.901 --> 03:27.119
And this is
my youngest, Evan.

03:27.163 --> 03:28.686
He skipped a grade.

03:28.730 --> 03:29.731
And this is Emery.

03:29.774 --> 03:31.298
He's...

03:32.734 --> 03:34.475
wearing a retainer.

03:35.345 --> 03:36.520
Retainer?

03:36.564 --> 03:39.436
Hey,
guess what I brought?

03:39.480 --> 03:41.482
-Oh.
-Red envelopes.

03:41.525 --> 03:42.744
40 bucks?

03:42.787 --> 03:43.919
I'm gonna convert these
into ones

03:43.962 --> 03:45.399
and, like,
roll around in it.

03:45.442 --> 03:47.314
And I'm this close
to buying a weather balloon.

03:47.357 --> 03:49.533
I prefer to take
my own measurements.

03:49.577 --> 03:51.709
Enough of your lies,
Al Roker.

03:52.754 --> 03:54.538
You gave 'em
40 bucks each,

03:54.582 --> 03:56.323
and you couldn't pitch in
for a tank of gas?

03:56.366 --> 03:57.715
You use premium.

03:57.759 --> 04:01.066
And you use regular,
like your face.

04:04.331 --> 04:06.289
All right, Horace,
that's it.

04:06.333 --> 04:09.205
You, me,
in the backyard, now!

04:14.471 --> 04:16.517
Woman: What do you want?

04:16.560 --> 04:18.345
I heard you got a phone call
from Brad.

04:21.043 --> 04:22.784
You know about
the phone call?

04:24.394 --> 04:26.309
Jessica: I-I was
just wondering...

04:26.353 --> 04:28.572
did I leave my rain poncho
in here?

04:31.706 --> 04:34.274
Oh, are you watching
"The Young and the Restless"?

04:41.063 --> 04:43.761
Jessica,
don't you also like

04:43.805 --> 04:45.154
"The Young and the Restless"?

04:45.197 --> 04:46.242
No.
Why are they restless?

04:46.286 --> 04:47.374
Life is easy
when you're young.

04:47.417 --> 04:48.940
You're not helping.Neither are you.

04:48.984 --> 04:52.814
Ai-ya! I can't watch my show
with all the whisper-whisper.

04:55.643 --> 04:58.210
Wait, wait, i-if you want
to play mahjong,

04:58.254 --> 04:59.734
why don't we just
do it here?

04:59.777 --> 05:01.823
Jessica would love
to sit in.

05:09.874 --> 05:11.485
What are you doing?

05:11.528 --> 05:12.921
Jenny lives
at the mahjong parlor.

05:12.964 --> 05:14.618
She's the reason
they built that ramp.

05:14.662 --> 05:15.489
Yeah, that's great.

05:15.532 --> 05:17.578
What better way
to find common ground

05:17.621 --> 05:19.144
than doing something
that shelikes?

05:19.188 --> 05:20.581
I'm really bad at it.

05:20.624 --> 05:22.626
And I don't like playing games
I can't win.

05:22.670 --> 05:24.498
It's not about
what you like.

05:24.541 --> 05:26.064
It's about connecting.

05:26.238 --> 05:27.065
Grandma: Hey.

05:29.764 --> 05:31.418
One, two, three...

05:31.461 --> 05:33.637
Ugh, we don't have
a fourth player.

05:33.681 --> 05:34.812
I guess we can't play.

05:37.467 --> 05:39.426
All right, are we playing
Chinese Classical

05:39.469 --> 05:40.557
or Chinese New Style?

05:42.080 --> 05:44.431
Uh, you, uh, guys sure

05:44.474 --> 05:45.954
you don't wanna settle this
with a game of Horse?

05:45.997 --> 05:47.477
Pig, if we're short on time?

05:47.521 --> 05:48.522
All right,
on the count of 3,

05:48.565 --> 05:49.610
we're gonna tussle.

05:49.653 --> 05:51.176
Excuse me, Mr. Huang.

05:51.220 --> 05:53.265
You're in the line
of my tackle.

05:53.309 --> 05:54.658
Uh, guys,
I saw some rabbits out here.

05:54.702 --> 05:55.659
There might be poops.

05:55.703 --> 05:57.226
Oh, perfect,
it's the Year of the Rabbit.

05:57.269 --> 05:58.488
And I'm sick of the way

05:58.532 --> 06:00.055
this one's been running
his mouth all day.

06:00.098 --> 06:02.797
The only thing I'm running
is the pain train.

06:02.840 --> 06:05.060
Next stop -- your body.

06:05.103 --> 06:06.888
He's gonna
take his glasses off, right?

06:06.931 --> 06:08.672
I can't believe
this is actually happening.

06:08.716 --> 06:10.892
I knew we should've built
that steel cage.

06:10.935 --> 06:12.328
"We don't need
a steel cage, Eddie.

06:12.372 --> 06:13.851
We're never gonna use it."

06:13.895 --> 06:15.418
Care to make this
more interesting?

06:15.462 --> 06:18.290
Maybe put our red-envelope money
on the match?

06:18.334 --> 06:19.988
Hell yeah.
My money's on Julius.

06:20.031 --> 06:21.642
He has forearms
the size of thighs

06:21.685 --> 06:23.208
and thighs the size of...

06:23.252 --> 06:24.122
double-thighs.

06:24.166 --> 06:26.124
True.

06:26.168 --> 06:28.562
But Horace has youth
and vitality on his side.

06:28.605 --> 06:30.433
Ugh, you're right.
I'm taking Horace.

06:31.695 --> 06:32.435
You ready, old-timer?

06:32.479 --> 06:34.350
Oh, I'm ready!Let's go!

06:34.394 --> 06:35.699
Hey, hey, I'm sure
this isn't anything

06:35.743 --> 06:36.657
a nice limeade can't fix.

06:36.700 --> 06:37.832
How about we go inside

06:37.875 --> 06:39.094
and talk this out
like civilize--

06:39.137 --> 06:40.443
Both: 1, 2, 3!

06:48.756 --> 06:49.713
Oh-ho-ho-ho-ho!

06:49.757 --> 06:50.932
You guys grappling?

06:50.975 --> 06:52.281
I'm next.

06:54.936 --> 06:56.590
Hey, your dad told me
about your retainer.

06:56.633 --> 06:58.592
You need any extra cases,
I can hook you up.

06:59.767 --> 07:00.507
Yes!

07:05.903 --> 07:07.122
No!

07:07.165 --> 07:08.515
This is why you never
take gambling advice

07:08.558 --> 07:09.994
from the person
you're betting against.

07:11.300 --> 07:12.736
You okay, son?

07:12.780 --> 07:13.737
I am now.

07:13.781 --> 07:14.521
Thanks, Dad.

07:15.565 --> 07:18.525
Uh...what just happened?

07:18.568 --> 07:20.527
Oh, we tussle
every Chinese New Year.

07:20.570 --> 07:22.354
It's our reset button
to start the year fresh.

07:22.398 --> 07:23.660
Uh-huh, back in the Navy,

07:23.704 --> 07:26.489
we used to call that
a Submarine Scramble.

07:26.533 --> 07:28.752
Oh, is that
what that means?

07:28.796 --> 07:31.363
Well, in our family,
our fists are our words.

07:31.407 --> 07:32.364
Right, boys?

07:32.408 --> 07:33.627
-Sure.
-If you say so.

07:33.670 --> 07:35.150
Whatever.

07:37.587 --> 07:38.936
Is Emery mad at me?

07:38.980 --> 07:41.417
Just a guess, but earlier
you introduced him

07:41.461 --> 07:42.940
as "the one
with the retainer."

07:42.984 --> 07:44.942
Really? I don't think
that bothered him.

How did you get to be
so good, Jenny?

08:41.608 --> 08:43.566
Patience.

08:43.610 --> 08:47.004
Wait until your enemy
make a mistake

08:47.048 --> 08:48.615
and then pounce.

08:50.442 --> 08:52.053
Oh, did y'all catch Roker
this morning?

08:52.096 --> 08:55.491
'Cause he's predicting
a strong...south wind.

09:02.890 --> 09:04.718
Okay, I get it!

09:04.761 --> 09:06.067
I'm bad at mahjong!

09:06.110 --> 09:08.765
Why don't we all have a laugh
at the big dum-dum!

09:08.809 --> 09:11.638
Ha ha ha, Jessica,
you big dum-dum.

09:11.681 --> 09:12.769
Ha ha ha!

09:14.423 --> 09:15.511
Deidre: Yikes.

09:16.643 --> 09:17.687
Ho boy.

09:23.301 --> 09:24.346
Jessica...

09:30.570 --> 09:32.006
Bridge.

09:33.529 --> 09:36.532
I'm like one tile away
from Wriggling Snake.

09:43.713 --> 09:44.714
Grandma: Oops.

09:45.672 --> 09:47.630
Oops. Oops.

09:47.674 --> 09:49.763
It's okay.
I'll clean it up.

09:51.591 --> 09:53.331
Why are you being
so nice to me?

09:58.119 --> 10:01.513
It was like seeing Mike Tyson
with his little pigeons.

10:01.557 --> 10:05.343
I am not pigeon Mike Tyson.
I'm ear-biting Mike Tyson.

10:05.387 --> 10:08.520
Either way,
you're clearly on edge.

10:08.564 --> 10:09.913
Well, it didn't help

10:09.957 --> 10:12.046
that you were throwing
my dumplings at chipmunks.

10:20.141 --> 10:21.490
The one with gunpowder?

10:21.533 --> 10:22.534
Shh.

10:32.370 --> 10:35.069
Other then Grandma,
nothing smells better
than fresh cash.

10:35.112 --> 10:36.723
Take me home tonight,
Eddie's money.

10:37.985 --> 10:40.248
You guys had action
on our tussle?

10:40.291 --> 10:41.510
That's awesome.

10:41.553 --> 10:43.730
What happened to your vitality
out there, man?

10:44.774 --> 10:46.907
All right,
who's up for some limeade?

10:46.950 --> 10:48.909
Horace: Oh, yes. Ah.

10:48.952 --> 10:51.563
Hey, um, sorry about
the retainer thing.

10:51.607 --> 10:52.695
Do you wanna talk about it?

10:52.739 --> 10:54.828
No, hard to talk
with metal in my mouth.

10:54.871 --> 10:56.220
I'll be in my room.

10:57.874 --> 11:00.834
Ooh, he does not
like you.

11:00.877 --> 11:02.400
You guys should
try a tussle.

11:02.444 --> 11:03.837
That's a great idea, Dad.

11:03.880 --> 11:05.099
Aww, thanks, buddy.

11:05.142 --> 11:07.362
What? I can't fight my son.Sure you can.

11:07.405 --> 11:08.755
Quick shot to the throat,
he won't be able to breathe.

11:08.798 --> 11:09.712
While he's stunned,
you pin him.

11:09.756 --> 11:11.540
Yeah, I love to use
my 'bows.

11:11.583 --> 11:12.933
I call them
nature's hammers.

11:12.976 --> 11:14.848
Where were those 'bows
10 minutes ago?

11:14.891 --> 11:16.850
No, I'm not afraid
to fight him.

11:16.893 --> 11:18.286
I just don't want to.

11:18.329 --> 11:19.940
That'll make things
even worse.

11:19.983 --> 11:20.941
If you say so.

11:20.984 --> 11:22.725
Well,
if there's no tussle,

11:22.769 --> 11:23.857
I'm gonna go clock in
a quick shift

11:23.900 --> 11:27.904
and capitalize on that
Goo Goo Dolls post-concert rush.

11:27.948 --> 11:29.732
Hey,
drive safe out there.

11:29.776 --> 11:31.429
I love you.Love you.

11:33.693 --> 11:34.911
All right, Emery,
that's it!

11:34.955 --> 11:38.175
You, me,
in the backyard, now!

11:45.443 --> 11:47.358
Like children
in a ball pit.

11:53.364 --> 11:55.932
I know.
I've seen it before.

11:59.153 --> 12:00.458
Mmm.
These are incredible.

12:05.594 --> 12:06.769
The only reason I lose

12:06.813 --> 12:09.511
is because I don't know the game
well enough to cheat.

12:13.254 --> 12:14.603
Oh, yeah.

12:14.646 --> 12:17.214
Sometimes I hide Trivial Pursuit
wedges in my mouth.

12:17.258 --> 12:19.477
Tricky-tricky.

12:19.521 --> 12:21.784
When I play board games
with the boys,

12:21.828 --> 12:23.699
we play for chores.

12:23.743 --> 12:26.702
I haven't had to scrub a toilet
in five years.

12:26.746 --> 12:28.922
Oh, you bad mama.

12:28.965 --> 12:30.837
You're real bad.

12:32.273 --> 12:33.665
All right.

12:33.709 --> 12:35.798
I want a clean tussle,

12:35.842 --> 12:37.017
nothing below the belt.

12:37.060 --> 12:39.062
Why do
we have to do this?

12:39.106 --> 12:41.238
Because you're mad at me
and we need to reset.

12:41.282 --> 12:42.196
By fighting?

12:42.239 --> 12:43.937
You sure you want
to do this, Lou?

12:43.980 --> 12:45.677
I'd be happy to step in
for your boy.

12:45.721 --> 12:47.462
Will everyone stop trying
to talk me out of this?

12:47.505 --> 12:48.680
It worked
for Julius and Horace.

12:48.724 --> 12:50.813
Now, let's go!

12:50.857 --> 12:53.207
Hey, Evan, care to
make this interesting?No way.

12:53.250 --> 12:55.644
Dad is way bigger
and obviously gonna win.

12:55.687 --> 12:56.993
This isn't an even match.

12:57.037 --> 12:59.082
Come on. You got to give me
a chance to win my money back.

12:59.126 --> 13:00.867
How about I give you odds
on Emery?

13:02.694 --> 13:03.913
I don't know...

13:03.957 --> 13:06.046
2-to-1. Come on,
he's your brother.

13:06.089 --> 13:08.918
Fine. You're lucky
I live for the action.

13:08.962 --> 13:10.485
Okay.

13:10.528 --> 13:11.965
On the count of 3.

13:12.008 --> 13:14.924
1, 2, 3.

13:31.593 --> 13:33.334
My retainer!

13:36.903 --> 13:38.339
Yes!

13:38.382 --> 13:40.341
No!

13:41.951 --> 13:44.127
The winner! Ha ha!

13:44.171 --> 13:46.129
Here's what I accept --

13:46.173 --> 13:49.089
cash, cold hard cash,
or cash money.

13:51.787 --> 13:54.355
Okay,
that's the last of it.

13:54.398 --> 13:56.052
Let's move everything
to the dining table.

13:56.096 --> 13:57.662
Hmm.

13:57.706 --> 14:00.361
Ooh, this fish eye's
extra big.

14:00.404 --> 14:03.538
Probably worth nine years
of good fortune.

14:03.581 --> 14:05.105
I'll go get the boys.

14:05.148 --> 14:07.063
Thank you
for all your help, Jenny.

14:07.107 --> 14:08.282
I really enjoyed this.

14:13.983 --> 14:15.506
But I always eat it.

14:21.164 --> 14:23.732
I told you that
in confidence.

14:32.045 --> 14:34.961
Oh, that duck
was just amazing.

14:35.004 --> 14:36.571
Wasn't it, honey?Mmm, wasn't it?
So good.

14:36.614 --> 14:40.575
Oh. Who's going to eat
the fish eye?

14:40.618 --> 14:42.011
Me!

14:43.665 --> 14:45.362
Mmm.

14:45.406 --> 14:46.276
Oh!
G-mah!

14:46.320 --> 14:47.625
She ate the fish eye!So gross.

14:47.669 --> 14:50.063
Do I have eye
in my teeth?

14:55.198 --> 14:56.330
Damn it.

14:56.373 --> 14:57.505
Horace has
the cab light off.

14:57.548 --> 14:59.159
Hurry up. That means
he's running the meter.

14:59.202 --> 15:00.073
Thanks again.
We had fun.

15:00.116 --> 15:02.162
You can't go now.

15:02.205 --> 15:03.337
You tell me to build a bridge

15:03.380 --> 15:04.947
and then you just leave me
with a monster?

15:04.991 --> 15:07.384
Oh, so, Jenny ate
the fish eye.

15:07.428 --> 15:09.647
There's another -- the milky
blind one on the bottom.

15:09.691 --> 15:10.953
The popped one?

15:10.997 --> 15:12.824
That's not the power eye.

15:12.868 --> 15:14.217
I thought that you were here
to help me.

15:14.261 --> 15:15.958
-Careful.
-I got it.

15:16.002 --> 15:17.003
What are you doing?

15:17.046 --> 15:19.092
Grandma says the big TV
is hers now.

15:19.135 --> 15:21.790
She's been barking orders at me
like Lou Gossett Jr.

15:21.833 --> 15:22.878
In which movie?

15:22.922 --> 15:24.010
All of them.

15:26.012 --> 15:28.057
Do you know why
she ate the eye?

15:28.101 --> 15:29.754
Why she's taking the TV?

15:29.798 --> 15:32.105
Because while I was busy
building your bridge,

15:32.148 --> 15:34.585
she dug a tunnel
and she stole my throne.

15:34.629 --> 15:36.239
I'm getting confused
by your metaphors.

15:36.283 --> 15:36.979
Just say what happened.

15:37.023 --> 15:38.372
I let a secret slip,

15:38.415 --> 15:40.156
and now she's holding it
over my head.

15:40.200 --> 15:43.029
Sounds like she used
her mahjong strategy

15:43.072 --> 15:44.813
to set you up.

15:44.856 --> 15:48.208
Wait until your enemy
make a mistake

15:48.251 --> 15:50.253
and then pounce.

15:50.297 --> 15:51.820
She mahjong-ed me.

15:51.863 --> 15:54.605
Well, maybe there's another
activity you can bond over.

15:54.649 --> 15:57.043
Oh, I hear fostering
an abused horse

15:57.086 --> 15:58.783
can bring people
together.
Screw that.

15:58.827 --> 16:00.133
You know,
she's got something on me?

16:00.176 --> 16:01.917
Well, I've got something
on her.

16:01.961 --> 16:04.441
She's not the only one
who can exploit a weakness.

16:04.485 --> 16:08.141
If you don't stop
honking that horn,

16:08.184 --> 16:10.056
I'm gonna tussle you!

16:10.099 --> 16:12.188
Happy New Year,
Jessica.

16:14.495 --> 16:16.062
Instead of
a weather balloon,

16:16.105 --> 16:17.628
I can almost afford
a hot air balloon.

16:17.672 --> 16:19.630
I could balloon
to school.

16:19.674 --> 16:21.241
Let's see the bullies
make fun of me then.

16:21.284 --> 16:23.112
Stop dreaming of ways
to get to school.

16:23.156 --> 16:24.592
I deserve a chance
to win my money back.

16:24.635 --> 16:26.376
Can you guys
keep it down?

16:26.420 --> 16:27.943
My eye is throbbing.

16:27.987 --> 16:30.119
Whoa. I've never heard
"throbbing" used

16:30.163 --> 16:31.294
to describe an eye before.

16:32.730 --> 16:33.427
Oh.
Oh.

16:33.470 --> 16:34.428
Morning, everyone.

16:34.471 --> 16:38.084
Eyyy, there he is --
Kid Dynamite.

16:38.127 --> 16:40.825
Take your gal out
for a malt on me.

16:40.869 --> 16:41.957
Thanks.

16:42.001 --> 16:43.611
You were right.
Tussling worked.

16:43.654 --> 16:44.873
I'm not mad anymore.

16:44.916 --> 16:46.309
Good.

16:46.353 --> 16:48.268
I'm going to be
in my room.

16:50.357 --> 16:51.662
You boys want anything?

16:51.706 --> 16:53.142
I'm going out
for a shoe-shine.

17:02.760 --> 17:05.763
I figured since
I'm so terrible at mahjong,

17:05.807 --> 17:08.853
I would come here and watch you
play with your friends.

17:08.897 --> 17:09.985
Pick up a few tips.

17:19.342 --> 17:20.300
I know your tell --

17:20.343 --> 17:21.997
something you do

17:22.041 --> 17:23.651
whenever you get excited.

17:23.694 --> 17:25.566
Like when you have
a good mahjong hand.

17:26.784 --> 17:28.221
You took away my power.

17:28.264 --> 17:29.787
Now I'm going to
take away yours.

17:29.831 --> 17:32.355
If you don't step down,
I'll expose you,

17:32.399 --> 17:34.531
and you'll never be able
to play mahjong here again.

17:34.575 --> 17:36.359
I don't have a tell.

17:36.403 --> 17:39.275
Okay, let's do this
the hard way.

17:40.146 --> 17:42.191
There are three snacks
on this table.

17:42.235 --> 17:43.758
Which do you want?

17:43.801 --> 17:45.977
The animal crackers...

17:46.021 --> 17:47.762
the peanuts...

17:47.805 --> 17:49.764
or these?

17:54.856 --> 17:57.554
I guess I could just
throw these away, then.

17:57.598 --> 17:59.556
No, no,
not the Dunk-a-Roos.

18:01.819 --> 18:04.909
Well, it looks like we both
have dirt on each other now.

18:05.954 --> 18:07.086
I'm gonna eat these.

18:11.438 --> 18:14.528
You are not even
dunking the Roos.

18:16.530 --> 18:17.618
Hmm.

18:21.230 --> 18:22.188
Mm.

18:22.231 --> 18:23.276
Aah!

18:23.319 --> 18:25.713
What are you doing?

18:25.756 --> 18:27.976
You're mad at me.
We need to tussle.

18:28.019 --> 18:29.195
We have to reset.

18:29.238 --> 18:30.370
Emery, stop.

18:30.413 --> 18:31.371
I'm not mad at you.

18:31.414 --> 18:33.024
I just feel bad
I upset you so much

18:33.068 --> 18:34.287
with the retainer thing.

18:34.330 --> 18:37.290
Yeah, it wasn't great being
introduced as retainer boy.

18:37.333 --> 18:39.030
It was all I could think of
in the moment.

18:39.074 --> 18:41.381
I play volleyball.
I'm on student council.

18:41.424 --> 18:42.817
I can do a split.

18:45.602 --> 18:47.300
Whoa.
Yeah.

18:49.302 --> 18:51.304
I know it's not easy
being the middle child.

18:51.347 --> 18:53.219
You're not the oldest,
you're not the baby.

18:53.262 --> 18:55.656
You're just...Emery.

18:55.699 --> 18:57.179
A perfect kid
in every way.

18:57.223 --> 18:58.876
Except for my teeth.

18:58.920 --> 19:01.966
Hey, at least I now have
a new way of introducing you --

19:02.010 --> 19:03.968
as the son who beat me up.

19:06.797 --> 19:09.191
A hug?
What does that mean?

19:09.235 --> 19:11.585
A hug is a push.
That means no payout.

19:11.628 --> 19:14.414
We were betting on a tussle,
not a heartwarming moment.

19:14.457 --> 19:16.198
Okay, okay, um,
double or nothing

19:16.242 --> 19:17.765
that I can
make you laugh.

19:17.808 --> 19:20.202
I don't tickle
in my pits.

19:20.246 --> 19:21.421
Wait, come back here.

19:21.464 --> 19:23.074
Come back here and bet me.

19:27.905 --> 19:29.255
Are you mad because
you lost the TV

19:29.298 --> 19:30.647
or because
I know your tell?

19:35.478 --> 19:36.392
What?

19:41.615 --> 19:42.616
Mmm.

19:42.659 --> 19:44.487
So, who's going to eat
the fish eye?

19:44.531 --> 19:45.488
Me!

19:47.447 --> 19:48.274
Oh!
Moms!

19:48.317 --> 19:50.232
She ate the fish eye!So gross.

19:51.538 --> 19:55.281
You were mad all these years
because of a stupid fish eye?

20:01.112 --> 20:04.290
It was my first time making
Chinese New Year dinner

20:04.333 --> 20:05.639
and I was excited.

20:18.129 --> 20:19.305
How about this?

20:19.348 --> 20:22.960
If we promise to keep
each other's secrets,

20:23.004 --> 20:25.920
you can have the fish eye
every Chinese New Year.

20:28.575 --> 20:30.707
That's something else
I have on you.

20:30.751 --> 20:32.535
Well, maybe
that's our bridge --

20:32.579 --> 20:35.277
we're both masters of
psychological warfare.

20:35.321 --> 20:36.974
Hmm.

20:40.108 --> 20:41.370
Damn straight.

20:46.680 --> 20:48.508
This is to hide my tell.

20:48.551 --> 20:51.337
Nice try, but I am
not revealing what it is.

20:51.380 --> 20:52.425
Give me a hint.

20:52.468 --> 20:54.688
Is it above
or below the neck?

20:54.731 --> 20:56.211
Is it when you use
your pinkie nail

20:56.255 --> 20:57.386
to pick food
out of your teeth?

20:57.430 --> 20:58.735
Yeah, i-is that it?

20:58.779 --> 21:03.305
Okay, if you want to know
your tell so badly,

21:03.349 --> 21:05.742
I'll let you in on it.
Really?

21:05.786 --> 21:08.571
Yeah, of course.
It's when you --

21:08.615 --> 21:12.706
Not a chance
in hell, Jenny!

21:12.749 --> 21:14.011
All right.

21:14.055 --> 21:16.797
I don't know how to play,
but I don't care.

21:16.840 --> 21:20.017
Evan gave me an advance,
and I need to get my money back.

21:21.192 --> 21:23.325
I love this hand.
I'm all in.
