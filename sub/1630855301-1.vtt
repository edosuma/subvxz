WEBVTT

00:47.005 --> 00:49.049
Don't keep looking at it. Jesus.

00:50.342 --> 00:52.970
-I'm sorry.
-It's cool.

00:57.266 --> 00:59.893
Danny, you don't have to do this.
You know that, right?

01:03.856 --> 01:05.107
We're doing it.

01:11.905 --> 01:14.283
Rockefeller Center,
this is uptown D-train,

01:14.366 --> 01:17.077
next stop Seventh Avenue.
Watch the closing doors.

01:17.703 --> 01:19.913
He's not gonna hurt anyone anymore, okay?

01:49.568 --> 01:52.988
Danny. Come on.

02:11.507 --> 02:13.091
-Shit.
-What?

02:14.259 --> 02:15.219
Got him.

02:15.302 --> 02:16.470
Where?

02:16.553 --> 02:17.930
He just came out.

02:18.764 --> 02:20.224
Don't turn around.

02:23.560 --> 02:26.939
I know the way he goes. Come on.

03:19.950 --> 03:21.535
Okay, we'll split up, and I'll go around.

03:21.618 --> 03:24.329
I'll cut him off, and you know what to do.

03:25.455 --> 03:28.667
Thank you, Danny. We got this.

03:57.905 --> 03:59.740
Hey! Stop!

04:05.078 --> 04:09.082
Danny. Danny, shoot. Danny, come on!

04:09.583 --> 04:11.668
Danny! Danny, shoot him!

04:44.701 --> 04:46.036
Hey, you! Freeze!

04:46.703 --> 04:47.788
Stop!

05:19.736 --> 05:20.737
Shit.

05:28.453 --> 05:30.038
Yitzhak, hold on.

05:31.415 --> 05:32.708
Where is Ariana?

05:34.418 --> 05:36.712
-Something happened.
-What did you do?

05:36.795 --> 05:38.255
I didn't mean to.

05:38.338 --> 05:39.798
-What did you do?
-I didn't mean to.

05:39.882 --> 05:42.134
She made me do it. She made me. I'm sorry.

05:42.217 --> 05:43.218
I'm sorry. I'm--

05:44.803 --> 05:49.516
Listen, take the passports.
Take this. Go find your father.

05:50.017 --> 05:50.976
Okay.

06:37.981 --> 06:39.024
Police!

06:39.107 --> 06:41.527
Anyone in the house,
come out with your hands up!

06:47.366 --> 06:49.117
-Coming out the front.
-Get out here!

06:50.118 --> 06:51.370
Keep moving forward!

06:51.453 --> 06:54.581
Get out here now!
Get out here! Keep moving!

06:55.332 --> 06:58.293
Hands up! Get your hands in the air now!

06:58.377 --> 07:02.506
Come on! Walk slow! Keep moving forward!

07:02.589 --> 07:04.383
Come forward. Slowly.

07:06.426 --> 07:08.303
Hands in the air where I can see 'em!

07:08.387 --> 07:10.681
Keep 'em up there! Move slow!

07:10.764 --> 07:13.100
-Keep moving forward!
-Come over here now!

07:13.183 --> 07:15.352
-Keep moving!
-On the ground!

07:15.435 --> 07:17.604
-Get down on the ground!
-Get on the ground now!

07:17.688 --> 07:20.482
-Get down on the fucking ground!
-On your stomach, arms out!

07:30.117 --> 07:33.537
There's bullets flying,
glass everywhere, winged one guy.

07:33.620 --> 07:35.831
This lady took one in the leg.

07:35.914 --> 07:38.417
Kid's just a little good luck shy of
a murder charge.

07:39.042 --> 07:42.379
What about the girl, Ariana?
That's a pretty name.

07:42.462 --> 07:43.547
There's no sign of her either.

07:43.630 --> 07:46.717
I'm thinking that he offed her
and the landlord.

07:46.800 --> 07:50.053
This is what happens when your partner
reads one book on serial killers.

07:51.346 --> 07:52.347
So, come on, what do you think?

07:52.431 --> 07:54.349
-Is he one?
-It's not that simple.

07:54.433 --> 07:57.436
There are a number of dispositive factors
that I'm not seeing.

07:57.519 --> 07:59.605
And the nature of
the crime's inconsistent with his--

07:59.688 --> 08:03.692
Or "crimes," right? What about the girl?
What about the landlord?

08:03.775 --> 08:06.028
We got no weapon. We got no bodies.

08:06.111 --> 08:08.947
No, we know he has a gun.
There's blood on the floor of the house.

08:09.031 --> 08:11.366
There's signs of a struggle,
and there's a bullet hole in the glass.

08:11.450 --> 08:13.785
-It's circumstantial.
-Yeah, but what if he is?

08:14.328 --> 08:15.495
What if we caught one?

08:15.579 --> 08:19.124
Did he tell you what he was doing
firing a gun at Rockefeller Center?

08:19.208 --> 08:22.753
Yeah. Him and the girl,
they wanted to scare someone, he says.

08:22.836 --> 08:24.129
-Who?
-Won't say.

08:24.213 --> 08:25.839
Says it wouldn't serve.

08:28.842 --> 08:32.054
So, what do you think?
This is what you do, Professor.

08:34.014 --> 08:35.265
-Let me take a look.
-Yeah?

08:36.058 --> 08:37.558
Yeah.

08:53.575 --> 08:54.743
You ready?

08:57.246 --> 08:58.455
Yeah.

08:59.331 --> 09:00.374
All right.

11:09.545 --> 11:10.879
An hour's enough.

11:10.963 --> 11:12.256
Got it.

11:15.092 --> 11:16.301
Would you like to sit?

11:31.358 --> 11:32.734
Danny.

11:35.821 --> 11:36.947
How are they treating you?

11:37.030 --> 11:38.615
Just like everybody else, I guess.

11:39.700 --> 11:43.078
Well, I'm just here to talk.

11:43.745 --> 11:45.831
About what happened with Ariana. I know.

11:45.914 --> 11:48.166
Do you know where she is, Danny?

11:49.918 --> 11:51.044
No.

11:51.587 --> 11:52.588
Like I told the police,

11:52.671 --> 11:54.506
I haven't seen her
since what happened on the street.

11:54.590 --> 11:57.634
Well, the police can't find her either.

11:58.719 --> 12:01.346
What happened to Yitzhak, your landlord?

12:02.598 --> 12:03.599
I don't know.

12:04.975 --> 12:07.436
Well, if you can't tell me
where they are now,

12:08.353 --> 12:11.732
can you tell me how you ended up
living with them in that house?

12:11.815 --> 12:14.276
It was a rooming house.
I was rooming there.

12:16.153 --> 12:17.863
Danny, I'm trying to help you.

12:24.745 --> 12:25.787
Okay.

12:30.501 --> 12:34.505
When did you first meet them,
Ariana and Yitzhak?

12:35.297 --> 12:37.257
Junior year, high school.

12:39.885 --> 12:42.596
Could you be as precise as possible?

12:43.180 --> 12:48.519
1977. Spring. The sun was shining.

12:54.191 --> 12:56.360
I wasn't a very popular kid at school.

12:57.236 --> 13:00.531
Turns out that sad and moody
didn't do me any favors at home either.

13:08.789 --> 13:09.915
Dan!

13:09.998 --> 13:11.458
Can you please do something?

13:13.836 --> 13:15.379
Kid's spoiled, I'm telling you.

13:26.014 --> 13:27.099
Dan!

13:35.858 --> 13:38.443
Can you do something, please?
I'd like to take a shower.

13:40.279 --> 13:44.491
I said please.
Can you do something about this kid?

13:46.410 --> 13:48.871
-You hear me talking to you, right?
-Yes, I heard you.

13:48.954 --> 13:50.581
Would you just leave him alone?

13:54.209 --> 13:58.422
He lives. What is this place, a hotel?

14:01.425 --> 14:03.135
"Can't you just leave him alone?"

14:03.218 --> 14:04.970
Let's hustle. We're gonna be late.

14:05.053 --> 14:06.513
Want me to drive you to school?

14:06.597 --> 14:07.848
Sure.

14:08.765 --> 14:10.726
I'll make you a BLT to take with you.

14:10.809 --> 14:15.939
Jesus.
I got a hotel and cafeteria. I can't.

14:18.775 --> 14:20.068
Danny, go get ready.

14:22.112 --> 14:23.155
We're leaving in five.

14:37.377 --> 14:41.298
You know, I was thinking,
"I wish I could sleep until 8:00."

14:44.635 --> 14:46.637
He's one spoiled kid, you know that?

15:07.908 --> 15:09.284
-I gotta go.
-I gotta go.

15:11.245 --> 15:14.373
You know, how come you and me never
spend any time together no more?

15:14.456 --> 15:15.457
Hey.

15:16.625 --> 15:18.377
Look at me when I'm talking to you. Okay?

15:24.132 --> 15:25.551
What, you don't like me?

15:25.634 --> 15:27.261
Danny, let's go. I can't be late.

15:27.344 --> 15:29.596
-Get a move on, please.
-I've gotta go.

15:30.681 --> 15:32.808
You don't disrespect me
in this house, mister.

15:32.891 --> 15:35.394
-You understand me? You--
-Marlin, what the hell is going on here?

15:36.645 --> 15:38.605
Take your hand off him.

15:38.689 --> 15:42.568
That so? You gonna make me? What--

15:43.235 --> 15:44.444
Danny, go.

15:44.528 --> 15:45.571
Geez.

15:47.489 --> 15:49.616
Yeah, Danny. Go.

15:58.166 --> 15:59.209
You're pitiful.

15:59.751 --> 16:01.962
Yeah, well, I'm all you've got, Candy.

16:02.045 --> 16:05.132
So, what the fuck does that say about you?

16:07.134 --> 16:08.343
Have a nice day.

16:08.427 --> 16:09.428
Lunch.

16:20.439 --> 16:22.357
Okay, let's go. Come on.

16:25.611 --> 16:28.572
Man, you have got to get yourself
some stickers or something.

16:28.655 --> 16:30.949
It's so barren in there
it's full-on tragic.

16:31.033 --> 16:32.326
What's up, Jonny?

16:33.368 --> 16:36.163
You've got that look again.
Bad shit this morning?

16:36.830 --> 16:38.707
Your asshole stepfather?

16:39.541 --> 16:41.043
God, I hate him.

16:41.126 --> 16:43.212
Well, do you wanna see a thing?

16:43.712 --> 16:46.882
-Sure.
-All right, pick a card. Any card.

16:47.716 --> 16:49.426
-That one. Yeah.
-This guy? Okay.

16:49.510 --> 16:50.719
Where's Mike?

16:50.802 --> 16:52.846
That varsity thing in Philly, remember?

16:52.930 --> 16:54.640
-I thought that was over today.
-No.

16:54.723 --> 16:57.809
He's coming tonight though.
He's coming to Joey Lathem's party.

16:57.893 --> 16:59.269
We're going, right?

17:00.062 --> 17:02.272
-Yeah, sure, I guess. I--
-Hey, freak.

17:03.815 --> 17:05.108
Asshole.

17:06.777 --> 17:08.904
-Are you sure we're invited to that party?
-She put up signs.

17:08.987 --> 17:11.114
The whole class is invited.
I'll come get you at 7:00.

17:11.198 --> 17:13.282
No. Don't come to my house.
I'll meet you in the courtyard.

17:13.867 --> 17:15.702
Okay. Don't blow me off.

17:15.786 --> 17:18.247
-I'm not gonna blow you off.
-And check your pocket.

17:21.290 --> 17:22.751
And is that your card?

17:24.086 --> 17:25.838
No. I'll see you later, man.

17:25.921 --> 17:26.922
See ya.

17:36.640 --> 17:38.433
-It's good.
-Thanks.

17:39.268 --> 17:40.811
Is it Adam?

17:44.940 --> 17:46.567
You really miss him a lot, huh?

17:49.278 --> 17:51.363
Yeah, sometimes. Not all the time.

17:52.781 --> 17:55.826
'Cause you can never tell
when it's gonna come on, you know?

17:56.451 --> 17:57.286
Yeah.

17:57.369 --> 17:59.413
It's like I'm drowning
all of a sudden, you know?

18:00.497 --> 18:02.958
It's like that with me and my dad,
I guess.

18:03.041 --> 18:06.003
Even though I never really
thought about it that way.

18:09.381 --> 18:10.966
Come on. Let's go.

18:11.550 --> 18:15.929
Still makes me sad when I think about him.
I just miss him.

18:18.724 --> 18:20.934
You don't know what it was like
with Adam and I.

18:21.018 --> 18:26.231
We weren't just identical on the outside.
We were… inseparable.

18:27.316 --> 18:28.859
Can you tell me about him?

18:36.033 --> 18:38.410
Do you want to talk
about what happened to Adam?

18:40.954 --> 18:42.039
No.

18:43.290 --> 18:46.793
Well, no matter the circumstances,
I'm really sorry.

18:46.877 --> 18:48.128
Loss sucks.

18:49.880 --> 18:51.089
Is that your professional opinion?

18:52.090 --> 18:53.258
Something like that.

18:58.639 --> 19:00.390
-No.
-Man, I hear the music.

19:00.474 --> 19:02.476
I think we should just go home, Jonny.
I don't--

19:02.559 --> 19:04.728
-I don't think-- I don't thi-- I--
-Let's just try around back.

19:04.811 --> 19:05.771
Fuck it.

19:07.856 --> 19:09.066
It's a big house.

19:09.566 --> 19:14.029
-Are you sure we're invited to this?
-Yeah, man. It'll be good.

19:19.326 --> 19:20.494
Do you see Mike?

19:21.578 --> 19:23.038
No, but he said he'd be here.

19:26.583 --> 19:31.380
Yo. I don't believe what I'm seeing.

19:31.463 --> 19:33.382
-Danny Sullivan.
-Hey, Mike.

19:33.882 --> 19:35.843
-I'm so happy you're here, bud.
-Good to see you, man.

19:35.926 --> 19:38.262
It's good to see you.
How'd you get him to come here?

19:38.345 --> 19:43.225
You little sneak. Come along.
There are libations, my boy.

19:43.308 --> 19:45.018
Hey, how was basketball?

19:45.769 --> 19:48.146
I'm good, so it was good.

19:48.230 --> 19:49.606
-You want a beer?
-Humble much.

19:49.690 --> 19:51.984
-No, I'm cool. Yeah, I'm good.
-It might help you loosen up.

19:52.067 --> 19:53.443
-Jonny boy?
-Yes, please.

19:53.527 --> 19:55.153
So how'd you play? How'd it go?

19:55.237 --> 19:56.864
-Dude, we played St. Ann's, all right?
-Right.

19:56.947 --> 20:00.534
I put up 18 points, okay.
One board shy of a double-double.

20:00.617 --> 20:02.369
You should've seen this one play, Danny…

20:04.246 --> 20:05.664
Damn.

20:05.747 --> 20:07.165
Who is that?

20:07.249 --> 20:11.753
That, my friend, is Annabelle Stone,
the hottest of the hot.

20:11.837 --> 20:14.423
And she's a transfer. Don't stare, man.

20:14.506 --> 20:16.425
-I'm not staring.
-Do you wanna go talk to her?

20:16.508 --> 20:17.968
-I don't wanna talk to her.
-You should.

20:18.051 --> 20:19.386
I'm not gonna go talk to her.

20:19.469 --> 20:21.763
-They got a bottle over there.
-Yeah, let's go hit the bottle.

20:21.847 --> 20:24.183
I wanna do that
more than talk to the pretty girl.

21:31.458 --> 21:33.794
Hi, I'm Annabelle.

21:35.712 --> 21:36.880
Danny. Hi.

21:36.964 --> 21:38.173
How you doing, Danny?

21:38.799 --> 21:40.759
I'm doing good. How are you doing?

21:41.301 --> 21:43.512
I'm good. You okay?

21:45.931 --> 21:49.017
I'm okay. Why?

21:49.101 --> 21:51.895
'Cause you're out here on your own.

21:54.356 --> 21:55.774
I like my own company.

21:57.234 --> 21:58.235
You smoke?

21:59.820 --> 22:02.030
Sometimes. A few times, anyway.

22:09.162 --> 22:11.039
Do you wanna get high?

22:15.377 --> 22:16.670
Yeah, totally.

22:17.546 --> 22:18.839
Cool.

22:24.928 --> 22:26.722
You have a joint or something?

22:28.724 --> 22:31.059
Oh, no,
I thought that you had a joint.

22:31.143 --> 22:33.061
I'm so-- I'm sorry.
I'm-- That was stupid. I--

22:33.145 --> 22:34.813
-It's okay.
-Annabelle!

22:36.773 --> 22:37.900
-Okay.
-Come on.

22:40.527 --> 22:42.821
Come. Let's go.

22:42.905 --> 22:44.239
Rain check?

22:45.240 --> 22:46.992
Oh, my God.

23:49.555 --> 23:50.556
About time.

23:53.559 --> 23:54.560
Sit down.

24:00.065 --> 24:01.108
Come on, sit with me.

24:10.909 --> 24:12.870
Did someone move into the ghost house?

24:14.079 --> 24:15.497
A ghost.

24:18.000 --> 24:19.751
Who are you staring at?

24:22.880 --> 24:23.964
Come on, sit with me.

24:29.845 --> 24:31.847
I have homework.

24:33.432 --> 24:34.474
Well, get inside then.

24:36.602 --> 24:37.769
Go.

24:40.397 --> 24:42.357
So that was the first time
you saw Yitzhak?

24:44.193 --> 24:45.194
Yes.

24:46.111 --> 24:47.613
And Ariana?

24:49.573 --> 24:52.117
I didn't see her. Not that night anyway.

24:52.201 --> 24:54.578
-But she was with him?
-I don't know.

24:55.287 --> 24:57.664
Maybe not yet.
It was years ago. I don't remember.

24:57.748 --> 25:00.250
So do you think that Ariana's
with him now?

25:00.334 --> 25:02.628
I keep telling you.
I don't know where she is.

25:06.131 --> 25:09.009
Yitzhak. Even the name sounds exotic.

25:09.593 --> 25:11.803
Did it strike you as strange,
him being there?

25:12.304 --> 25:13.347
What do you mean?

25:13.430 --> 25:16.642
Did he seem at all out of place
in your suburban neighborhood?

25:21.772 --> 25:23.232
Danny?

25:23.315 --> 25:26.902
I think Yitzhak would have been pretty
much out of place in any neighborhood.

25:30.364 --> 25:33.575
When did he show up again?
What were the circumstances?

25:35.160 --> 25:38.497
Things had been getting pretty bad
at home between my stepfather and I.

25:40.290 --> 25:43.126
I'd been spending more and more time
out of the house, I guess.

25:58.892 --> 25:59.810
Oh, shit.

26:02.646 --> 26:04.481
I can't believe you crashed your bike.

26:04.565 --> 26:06.567
Relax. I'm immortal.

26:06.650 --> 26:08.569
Yeah, tell that to the splotch
on the pavement.

26:09.403 --> 26:12.406
Mellow, man. Not melodrama.

26:12.990 --> 26:13.866
Hilarious.

26:14.408 --> 26:15.450
Check it out.

26:16.076 --> 26:19.037
Ghost house has got itself a ghost.
What's he doing?

26:20.581 --> 26:21.415
Gardening?

26:21.498 --> 26:23.041
Oh, shit. Hey.

26:23.125 --> 26:25.002
What's up, losers? What's going on?

26:25.919 --> 26:28.881
-Oh, shit. Ghost house got itself a ghost.
-Yeah.

26:29.381 --> 26:30.465
That's what I said.

26:30.549 --> 26:33.010
That's a big-ass ghost. Who is he?

26:33.093 --> 26:34.303
How should we know?

26:34.386 --> 26:36.305
Well, you're not gonna learn a lot
standing here.

26:36.388 --> 26:39.057
Mike.

26:49.276 --> 26:53.572
Hey, man. Hey, how's it going?

26:53.655 --> 26:56.074
I'm Mike. This is Jonny.
And Danny here's your neighbor.

26:56.158 --> 26:57.492
He lives across the street.

26:57.576 --> 26:58.577
Hi.

27:00.412 --> 27:02.456
Hello. I'm Yitzhak.

27:05.042 --> 27:06.585
You're not from around here.

27:08.420 --> 27:09.713
What gave me away?

27:13.342 --> 27:14.551
I'm from Israel.

27:15.594 --> 27:16.637
Cool.

27:19.515 --> 27:20.891
Nice to meet you, boys.

27:21.475 --> 27:23.435
So what did he say? Do you remember?

27:23.519 --> 27:26.855
If you could be precise as possible,
it'd be really helpful.

27:28.815 --> 27:31.193
He said he was reopening
the boardinghouse,

27:31.860 --> 27:33.779
and he might have said
he had some business in the area.

27:33.862 --> 27:36.240
Business? What kind of business?
Did he say?

27:37.074 --> 27:37.991
And Ariana?

27:38.867 --> 27:40.953
I guess she was in the house,
hadn't met her yet.

27:42.913 --> 27:45.916
There were some assaults
in Elm Ridge that year.

27:51.922 --> 27:55.592
Statistically uncommon for the area.
Still unsolved.

27:59.680 --> 28:02.474
What do you want me to say,
that she was off attacking people?

28:04.685 --> 28:05.686
So, what happened then?

28:07.771 --> 28:08.814
Jonny had an idea.

28:09.815 --> 28:12.025
It was a ploy
to help me out with Annabelle.

28:14.653 --> 28:17.197
Saw your girlfriend Annabelle
getting pizza at Renaldo's.

28:18.532 --> 28:19.825
Did she ask about me?

28:19.908 --> 28:22.911
She might be more useful
as a girlfriend if she knew you existed.

28:23.954 --> 28:25.539
Details, details.

28:25.622 --> 28:28.000
Nah, I'm serious, dude.
You should ask her out or something.

28:28.500 --> 28:30.043
She's not gonna wanna go out with me.

28:30.127 --> 28:31.920
-Why not?
-Let's start with "why?"

28:32.838 --> 28:34.965
-Maybe.
-You need more confidence, dude.

28:35.966 --> 28:38.760
I mean, didn't she ask
to get high together?

28:39.344 --> 28:41.013
-Just ask her back.
-You know what, Mike?

28:41.096 --> 28:42.806
-That's actually a really great idea.
-Thank you.

28:42.890 --> 28:44.892
The only problem is that
I don't have any grass.

28:44.975 --> 28:46.018
Details, details.

28:46.101 --> 28:47.352
Well, we should remedy that.

28:48.770 --> 28:51.148
-What do you mean?
-Think about it. Girls like pot.

28:51.231 --> 28:52.983
We like girls. Transitive property…

28:53.066 --> 28:54.067
Pot likes girls?

28:54.776 --> 28:56.111
Hey, I owe you from last week.

28:57.654 --> 28:59.948
There's a guy who deals
out of the old park in Ellenville.

29:01.033 --> 29:03.202
Wait, you want us to buy pot?

29:03.285 --> 29:06.121
No, I want us to buy a lot of pot.

29:07.915 --> 29:09.541
Okay. How much are we talking about?

29:10.042 --> 29:13.086
We buy an ounce, it's 100 bucks.
We sell it, we get 150.

29:13.170 --> 29:16.423
My bike's fixed, you get new shades,

29:16.507 --> 29:19.051
and Danny gets to keep enough weed
to get laid over and over again.

29:20.677 --> 29:22.846
-It's not a bad plan.
-No, no, it's a great plan.

29:22.930 --> 29:25.557
Only, where the hell
are we gonna get 100 bucks?

29:25.641 --> 29:27.809
Those new cash machines.

29:27.893 --> 29:29.853
You said
your asshole stepfather uses them, right?

29:30.646 --> 29:34.191
And you said he keeps the code
in his underwear drawer.

29:34.274 --> 29:36.109
Motherfucker is scary and stupid.

29:36.193 --> 29:39.780
So, all we gotta do is get the code
and his card, and we're good to go.

29:40.781 --> 29:42.366
And then what?
We're gonna steal his money?

29:42.449 --> 29:44.826
-Jonny, no.
-No, man. I mean, we borrow it.

29:44.910 --> 29:47.287
How often does he even use it?
Is he a regular?

29:47.371 --> 29:49.706
Yeah, Saturdays he gets cash out
for offtrack betting,

29:49.790 --> 29:52.000
and then he deposits his checks.
Don't you need that key?

29:52.084 --> 29:53.877
No, man. Don't underestimate--

29:53.961 --> 29:55.796
Danny! Geez.

29:56.463 --> 29:59.550
So we've got a whole week to put his money
back before he even notices.

30:00.050 --> 30:02.177
I don't know, Jonny,
it kind of seems like a terrible idea.

30:02.261 --> 30:06.557
Well, alternatively, how great would it be
to not be broke all the time?

30:06.640 --> 30:08.642
You could get high with Annabelle
as much as you wanted.

30:08.725 --> 30:11.103
Look, wouldn't it be easier
to just buy a few loose joints?

30:11.186 --> 30:12.896
-Exactly.
-You want her to know you're broke?

30:12.980 --> 30:15.899
You want to be like, "Hey, Annie, babe,
let's smoke some weed,

30:15.983 --> 30:17.693
but only one joint this week
because that's

30:17.776 --> 30:19.194
-all my broke-ass can afford."
-Yeah, yeah.

30:19.278 --> 30:21.113
Jonny, I'm not even really sure
she wants to anyway.

30:21.196 --> 30:23.866
But don't you wanna find out?
I mean, think about it.

30:23.949 --> 30:26.410
-Annabelle naked.
-Jonny.

30:26.493 --> 30:29.663
Man, screw Farrah Faw--
Nah, screw Annabelle.

30:29.746 --> 30:32.958
Dude, Marlin would literally kill him
if he found out.

30:33.458 --> 30:36.378
And
the answer to that is literally simple.

30:36.879 --> 30:39.256
We don't get caught.

30:43.010 --> 30:44.720
-There you go, Danny.
-Come on.

30:44.803 --> 30:47.181
-There you go.
-Hi, can I have a-- What do you want?

30:47.264 --> 30:49.433
-Vanilla-cherry dip, please?
-It was gonna be so easy.

30:49.975 --> 30:52.227
We waited until he got back
from the bar that night.

30:54.396 --> 30:56.523
He always got passed-out drunk
on a Saturday.

30:58.275 --> 31:00.319
My mom worked
a double shift at the hospital.

31:00.402 --> 31:03.572
So you figured you'd just get in, get out?

31:04.281 --> 31:07.618
The whole plan was gonna go off
without a hitch.

31:55.624 --> 31:57.209
Four, seven, two, nine.

31:59.336 --> 32:01.922
Four, seven, two, nine.

33:21.210 --> 33:22.294
Okay.

33:23.670 --> 33:25.339
Geez.

33:25.422 --> 33:26.882
But he's got the code, right?

33:46.527 --> 33:49.571
-What the fuck? What is this?
-Yes, Danny.

33:51.156 --> 33:52.199
-Dude!
-Let's go!

33:52.282 --> 33:54.493
-You got it, dude!
-Yeah, it totally worked.

33:54.576 --> 33:55.827
God, let's see.

33:57.079 --> 33:58.705
-That's nice, dude!
-Look at that.

33:58.789 --> 34:00.332
It kept making a noise.

34:00.415 --> 34:02.918
-There you go, Danny boy.
-All right. What?

34:03.001 --> 34:04.837
Look at these fifties, man.

34:04.920 --> 34:07.339
Fifties? Look, this kid's
creaming in his pants over fifties.

34:07.422 --> 34:09.257
-You never seen 100 bucks before?
-Like you have.

34:09.341 --> 34:11.342
-Guys, please!
-What?

34:11.426 --> 34:13.804
-Well, what are we gonna do?
-Just head down to the park.

34:13.887 --> 34:16.556
I know we're gonna head to the park,
but what do we do when we get to the park?

34:16.639 --> 34:18.891
David says,
"Ask for this kid named Angelo."

34:18.976 --> 34:20.893
-He's supposed to be our guy.
-Who the fuck is David?

34:20.978 --> 34:23.981
You don't know David? Science David.
David W. You know David, man.

34:24.063 --> 34:25.899
Okay, so we're just
supposed to go to the park

34:25.983 --> 34:28.443
and ask for Angelo
like it's a grocery store?

34:28.527 --> 34:30.445
Yeah. Wait, slow down, bro. There's cops.

34:30.529 --> 34:32.531
-I can see the cops.
-Just pull over right down there.

34:32.614 --> 34:36.076
-Pull up at the left.
-Jonny, you have to shut the fuck up.

34:36.159 --> 34:37.452
I'm cool.

34:37.536 --> 34:39.913
-I'm gonna take the money away.
-Stop it. Stop.

34:41.123 --> 34:43.000
-Okay, so now what?
-Where's the money?

34:43.083 --> 34:44.543
-Money's in my pocket.
-Yeah, man.

34:44.626 --> 34:46.460
Okay, so just be chill.

34:46.545 --> 34:48.005
Be chill?
What the fuck does that mean?

34:48.088 --> 34:50.465
Just chill out.
It'll be fine. Let's go. Thank you, man.

34:51.592 --> 34:53.010
What does "be chill" mean?

34:54.428 --> 34:55.429
All right, okay.

34:57.139 --> 34:58.307
It's gonna be all right.

34:58.849 --> 35:01.518
-Here we go, boys. Come on.
-It's gonna be good.

35:03.645 --> 35:05.105
Okay, so just let me do the talking, okay?

35:05.189 --> 35:06.440
-Sure.
-Cool.

35:08.358 --> 35:09.359
Hey.

35:12.863 --> 35:14.198
What you want, white boy?

35:14.281 --> 35:15.490
I'm just looking for Angelo.

35:18.869 --> 35:21.705
I'm looking for Angelo.

35:32.466 --> 35:34.426
-Go ahead, bro.
-Thanks, man.

35:34.510 --> 35:36.470
Hell, no.

35:37.638 --> 35:39.139
Look at this, man.

35:45.270 --> 35:46.271
Yo, Angelo.

35:54.613 --> 35:56.823
-I know you?
-Yeah, I'm David's friend.

35:58.742 --> 35:59.952
I don't know no David.

36:00.744 --> 36:04.414
Somebody playing a joke on you, man.
You brave coming down here or just stupid?

36:06.250 --> 36:07.626
Stupid, probably.

36:09.169 --> 36:11.421
Look, man, we wanna buy an ounce of pot.

36:12.965 --> 36:14.800
"We wanna buy an ounce of pot," man.

36:19.847 --> 36:22.683
Okay, come into my office.

36:25.060 --> 36:26.061
After you.

36:28.105 --> 36:30.607
An ounce? That's a lot of weed, man.

36:31.859 --> 36:34.319
-You know how much that costs?
-One hundred dollars.

36:34.403 --> 36:36.446
One hundred dollars. You got $100?

36:41.285 --> 36:42.286
Show me.

36:47.958 --> 36:49.877
Just wanna make sure
it's not counterfeit, that's all.

36:53.755 --> 36:55.549
Okay.

36:59.261 --> 37:03.807
Colombian, Panama Red, Arabian Black.

37:05.058 --> 37:06.059
What you want?

37:07.019 --> 37:08.020
Panama Red.

37:09.062 --> 37:11.940
-Panama Red.
-Panama Red. You an expert now?

37:12.524 --> 37:15.569
-No, I just--
-Show me the cash. I said, "Right now."

37:18.488 --> 37:20.574
What the fuck you doing down here,
white boy?

37:21.366 --> 37:22.534
-Who the fuck you think you are?
-Okay…

37:22.618 --> 37:25.871
I should split you open right down
to your fucking asshole.

37:25.954 --> 37:27.456
Don't. Okay, don't.

37:27.539 --> 37:30.000
-And why the fuck not?
-I don't know, man. I don't know.

37:30.083 --> 37:34.046
I mean, we stick together
and you get a new stream of income.

37:34.129 --> 37:38.091
Right? A bunch of rich white kids wanna
buy pot, maybe some other shit, right?

37:38.175 --> 37:40.677
We take all the risk.
You can fucking sit pretty.

37:40.761 --> 37:43.138
You don't have to stand out here all night
just to make ends meet.

37:43.222 --> 37:44.640
I'm just saying.

37:46.266 --> 37:48.268
-Get the fuck outta here.
-Go, Danny, go.

37:50.062 --> 37:51.730
We need the weed.

38:00.197 --> 38:02.491
Run, bitch. Run.

38:08.705 --> 38:10.999
Go! Holy shit.

38:16.797 --> 38:18.465
-He's in, man. Go.
-Go!

38:27.516 --> 38:29.560
-Hey, Mike, are we clear?
-Yeah. You're clear.

38:30.727 --> 38:34.064
Okay, so, that is…

38:35.482 --> 38:39.736
-Shit.
-…three dime bags for us.

38:41.446 --> 38:42.614
Are we really doing this, man?

38:43.115 --> 38:44.741
-Hell yeah.
-Where's Jonny?

38:44.825 --> 38:46.326
You guys have got to chill.

38:47.119 --> 38:49.371
I'm gonna take the weed.
I'm gonna sell it at lunch.

38:50.539 --> 38:52.541
How is anybody gonna know
you have any to begin with?

38:52.624 --> 38:55.544
Because I told Sally Jepsum
that I have weed to move.

38:56.587 --> 38:58.213
-When did you tell Sally?
-This morning.

38:58.297 --> 38:59.840
Wait, you told one person this morning?

38:59.923 --> 39:01.884
That's how you're gonna move
an ounce of pot? Are you nuts?

39:01.967 --> 39:04.511
Please trust me, grasshopper.

39:06.805 --> 39:07.806
Jonny.

39:21.695 --> 39:23.280
-You guys-- All right.
-Come on, dude.

39:26.200 --> 39:27.534
And what can I do for ya?

39:28.285 --> 39:29.286
My pleasure.

39:29.870 --> 39:31.079
All right, have a good one.

39:31.622 --> 39:34.041
Okay. All right, what can I get for ya?

39:35.375 --> 39:37.127
Pleasure doing business with you.

39:37.836 --> 39:40.088
Okay. Thanks very much. Have a good day.

39:42.090 --> 39:43.509
Son of a bitch was right.

39:44.092 --> 39:45.511
I know. I can't believe he sold it all.

39:46.553 --> 39:48.430
-In an afternoon.
-In an afternoon. Right?

39:49.765 --> 39:51.183
Unbelievable.

39:51.266 --> 39:53.810
Oh, geez. Danny.
Danny, you all right, man?

39:55.187 --> 39:56.438
Ow. I'm okay.

39:57.856 --> 39:59.024
Incoming, six o'clock.

40:03.362 --> 40:05.280
Danny,
why are you still standing next to me?

40:08.325 --> 40:09.326
Go talk to Annabelle.

40:09.826 --> 40:10.827
No.

40:10.911 --> 40:13.872
What do you mean "no"?
Dude, this is your chance.

40:13.956 --> 40:14.957
Be brave, Danny.

40:18.418 --> 40:20.671
-I can be brave.
-Yeah. You got this.

40:31.473 --> 40:32.474
Hi, Annabelle.

40:33.016 --> 40:34.017
Hi.

40:34.977 --> 40:36.186
-Danny, right?
-Right.

40:36.770 --> 40:38.897
-This is my friend, Eden.
-Hi, Eden.

40:39.523 --> 40:40.399
Eden.

40:41.483 --> 40:43.819
-Wow.
-I know. It's her superpower.

40:43.902 --> 40:46.780
-What is?
-Being dismissive.

40:47.614 --> 40:49.700
Oh, yes, true.

40:55.080 --> 40:57.291
I was wondering what you were up to
this weekend.

40:57.374 --> 40:59.626
I got Charlotte's party. Are you going?

41:00.878 --> 41:01.879
Wasn't invited.

41:05.090 --> 41:06.216
That's just Saturday anyway.

41:09.511 --> 41:13.307
Well, if you're not doing anything
tonight, I actually got some pot,

41:13.390 --> 41:15.893
and I thought we could get some beers
and just hang out.

41:15.976 --> 41:17.019
Bullshit.

41:17.102 --> 41:20.230
You don't have any pot. You just
want to get your fingers down her jeans.

41:20.314 --> 41:22.482
I do too have pot. I actually have a ton.

41:22.566 --> 41:25.068
W-- A ton?
Is that how they're selling it now?

41:25.152 --> 41:27.738
It's figurative.
We have an ounce. We're selling it.

41:27.821 --> 41:30.073
I actually have three dime bags
in my locker.

41:30.157 --> 41:32.117
-Bullshit.
-Eden, stop.

41:33.285 --> 41:34.119
You were saying?

41:35.537 --> 41:39.082
Well, I just thought that maybe we could
hang out under the bridge or something.

41:40.417 --> 41:41.418
Yeah, sure.

41:42.878 --> 41:45.088
-Yeah?
-Yeah, tonight at 7:00?

41:47.424 --> 41:48.258
Sure.

41:48.842 --> 41:50.135
-Hey.
-Hey.

41:50.219 --> 41:51.637
-How you doing?
-I'm good. How are you?

41:51.720 --> 41:53.013
-What's so funny?
-Nothing.

41:55.766 --> 41:57.726
-I'm talking to you, freak.
-Hey, Bill.

41:57.809 --> 41:59.102
-Bill? Hey!
-Fuck off.

41:59.686 --> 42:01.230
-What's he want?
-Nothing.

42:01.313 --> 42:02.731
You're good. Let's go.

42:05.067 --> 42:06.652
-I'm sorry, Bill.
-Go fuck yourself.

42:07.819 --> 42:08.779
I'm sorry.

42:08.862 --> 42:09.696
Fuck.

42:19.206 --> 42:20.207
Mr. Sullivan.

42:28.715 --> 42:30.300
I'm gonna have to ask you
to open your locker.

42:33.178 --> 42:34.179
What?

42:34.972 --> 42:37.850
Mr. Sullivan, open your locker, please.
Right now.

42:39.852 --> 42:40.853
Why?

42:41.436 --> 42:44.189
We've had a report that you have marijuana
on school grounds.

42:48.610 --> 42:49.862
I don't have any marijuana.

42:49.945 --> 42:53.282
So you say. Open it now, please.

43:00.372 --> 43:01.540
He's fucked.

43:05.377 --> 43:06.670
Take your time.

43:09.548 --> 43:10.841
Please step back again.

43:27.107 --> 43:28.108
Empty out your pockets.

43:38.368 --> 43:41.830
You can lock it back up now.
I was clearly working on bad information.

43:42.581 --> 43:43.415
Come on.

43:46.210 --> 43:47.753
My apologies. Mr. Carter.

43:49.546 --> 43:52.299
Mr. Carter,
what the actual hell is wrong with you?

43:52.382 --> 43:55.385
-I'm sorry.
-Shut up! With me. Get out.

43:55.469 --> 43:58.222
-Get out.
-Look, just don't tell my dad.

43:59.681 --> 44:01.934
It's actually legal for him to hit you,
if they want.

44:02.017 --> 44:04.686
Relax, I handled it. Come on.

44:05.896 --> 44:08.232
You handled it? Wait,
what the fuck just happened?

44:08.315 --> 44:09.483
How come I'm not going to jail?

44:09.566 --> 44:12.402
I saw Bill and Eden talking
after lunch. I didn't like it.

44:12.486 --> 44:14.738
-I got a bad feeling.
-A bad feeling?

44:14.821 --> 44:16.073
So?

44:16.156 --> 44:19.493
I didn't have time
to get you, so I got Jonny.

44:19.576 --> 44:20.994
And I moved it.

44:22.204 --> 44:25.958
And in here is your old man's investment.

44:26.500 --> 44:28.836
And here is our profit.

44:28.919 --> 44:31.964
To the victors go the spoils.

44:33.841 --> 44:36.677
Wait, hold on, guys. Guys, wait.

44:37.261 --> 44:38.679
How the fuck did you get into my locker?

44:38.762 --> 44:41.181
I mean, how many times do I have to keep
telling you? I'm magic.

44:42.349 --> 44:44.059
Okay, you're magic, then where's the pot?

44:44.142 --> 44:45.644
Check your pockets.

44:47.521 --> 44:48.522
Check your pockets.

44:54.486 --> 44:56.071
Can I have some rolling papers, please?

45:52.961 --> 45:54.546
-Hey.
-Hey.

45:57.257 --> 45:58.926
I wasn't sure
you were actually gonna come.

46:00.177 --> 46:01.178
Yeah, me neither.

46:03.055 --> 46:05.724
You didn't have to get pot, you know?
I'd have hung out with you anyway.

46:08.477 --> 46:09.478
What?

46:11.355 --> 46:13.148
Just never actually occurred to me.

46:15.150 --> 46:20.197
I mean, since you went to all the trouble,
I'd hate to be rude.

46:27.204 --> 46:28.205
Pretty good.

46:32.918 --> 46:33.919
Push me?

46:35.963 --> 46:36.964
Sure.

46:39.216 --> 46:40.217
You ready?

46:45.806 --> 46:47.057
Push me.

46:52.104 --> 46:53.564
You're cute, Danny Sullivan.

46:54.815 --> 46:55.816
You're cute too.

46:56.817 --> 46:57.818
Push me.

47:05.033 --> 47:06.034
You wanna make out?

47:07.786 --> 47:08.787
Really?

47:09.329 --> 47:13.166
Yeah. I mean, we don't have to,
if you don't want to.

47:22.050 --> 47:25.470
Let's try it again. A little slower.

47:27.848 --> 47:28.849
Like this.

48:52.057 --> 48:53.600
Just talk to him, please. For me.

48:53.684 --> 48:57.354
-Okay, what do you want me to say exactly?
-I don't know. Just say-- Fuck.

48:57.855 --> 49:01.191
There he is.
I don't know, just speak to him.

49:01.275 --> 49:03.569
-Do it for me. Thank you.
-Yeah, okay.

49:05.028 --> 49:06.238
-Hey.
-Hi.

49:07.614 --> 49:09.283
You lied about what was in your locker.

49:10.158 --> 49:13.036
No, I didn't. I drew this for Annabelle.

49:13.537 --> 49:17.040
Oh, yeah. She told me to tell you that
last night was fun

49:17.124 --> 49:20.544
but it's not gonna work out between
the two of you. She says sorry.

49:33.891 --> 49:35.559
Could you give this to her for me, please?

49:37.477 --> 49:38.604
Loser.

49:42.941 --> 49:44.401
He drew you a picture.

49:47.863 --> 49:51.200
Danny, is this yours?

49:53.285 --> 49:54.286
Danny?

49:57.873 --> 49:59.082
Come with me.

50:31.949 --> 50:33.617
Hi, leave us a message at the beep.

50:34.618 --> 50:37.704
Candy, pick up. Call me when you get this

50:37.788 --> 50:41.250
and tell me if you've been
in my fucking bank account.

50:41.333 --> 50:43.627
There's gonna be hell to pay. I'm serious.

50:50.050 --> 50:51.051
Shit.

50:53.095 --> 50:54.137
Oh, fuck.

51:03.313 --> 51:07.401
Hey, asshole. Fucker.
You got me fucking suspended.

51:07.901 --> 51:09.736
Now I'm gonna kick your little wiry ass.

51:23.208 --> 51:25.544
Bill, I'm so sorry, please.
I didn't mean to--

51:30.007 --> 51:31.967
-Okay, Bill, that's enough, man.
-Fuck off!

51:34.428 --> 51:36.305
Bill. Please, Bill. Please.

51:37.431 --> 51:38.432
What the fuck?

51:40.434 --> 51:43.312
Stupid boy.
You should listen to your friends.

51:48.317 --> 51:49.568
You fucking freak!

51:49.651 --> 51:50.861
Go.

51:50.944 --> 51:53.530
-I'm gonna fucking kill you.
-Let's go.

51:57.034 --> 52:00.621
Pinch it. You're gonna have a shiner,
but you're gonna live.

52:09.463 --> 52:10.964
Do you wanna come in, clean yourself up?

52:24.520 --> 52:25.812
I didn't know what to do.

52:34.571 --> 52:38.492
I was scared to go back to school.
I was scared to go home.

52:39.493 --> 52:44.122
It never struck you as strange
that this man just showed up to save you?

52:48.460 --> 52:49.545
No. No, it didn't.

52:53.215 --> 52:54.299
Not at the time.

53:27.541 --> 53:28.584
You look like shit.

53:32.671 --> 53:34.089
It's nice to meet you too.

53:36.800 --> 53:39.636
And Ariana, she was staying there?

53:40.554 --> 53:41.638
She was rooming there.

53:43.473 --> 53:46.226
What were your first impressions of her?
Can you remember that?

53:49.897 --> 53:51.231
It was a long time ago.

53:53.525 --> 53:54.860
It was like I'd always missed her.

53:58.780 --> 54:00.532
I just didn't know it until I saw her.

54:04.995 --> 54:06.121
Barney and Clyde.

54:07.331 --> 54:08.332
Barney?

54:08.415 --> 54:09.833
It's what Yitzhak used to call us.

54:09.917 --> 54:11.627
His stupid accent.
He could never get it right.

54:12.794 --> 54:15.631
Hey, you have to squeeze hard.

54:15.714 --> 54:17.216
Yeah. Don't worry.

54:20.344 --> 54:21.512
And you never went home?

54:24.097 --> 54:25.849
I guess for a while I thought…

54:28.852 --> 54:29.895
I thought I was home.

54:34.233 --> 54:35.984
Do you think Ariana is with him now?

54:36.068 --> 54:39.112
I keep telling you,
I don't know where she is.

54:39.196 --> 54:42.282
Danny, are you really willing
to take the blame for this?

54:44.117 --> 54:47.704
If Ariana doesn't show up,
you're very likely to go to prison.

54:48.872 --> 54:51.708
So let me ask you again. Where is Ariana?

54:56.713 --> 54:57.840
Like I told the police, I don't--

54:57.923 --> 54:58.882
What happened to Yitzhak?

55:01.176 --> 55:05.514
They're not the only people close to you
to disappear, are they?

55:08.559 --> 55:09.560
What happened to Adam?

55:15.023 --> 55:18.485
Danny, where did they all go?

55:21.196 --> 55:23.073
What exactly are you accusing me of?
