<i>- Previously, on The Tudors...
- Do you really wanto fight? - Yes.</i>

00:04.478 --> 00:08.447
Take another wife? - Yes.
Am I not still able? To have a wife?

00:08.582 --> 00:11.450
To have more children?
To be myself?

00:11.485 --> 00:14.954
I mean to show these French that I will
not shy away from battle if I am
provoked.

00:15.022 --> 00:17.223
The Emperor is once more at war.

00:17.291 --> 00:20.793
A joint attack on France would
restore to the English crown

00:20.861 --> 00:24.931
all your lost territories,
the whole of Aquitaine.

00:24.998 --> 00:27.366
I still think the King
will want to remarry.

00:27.434 --> 00:31.003
And yet what woman on earth would want
to marry a King who either puts his
wives away

00:31.104 --> 00:33.005
or kills them?

00:33.106 --> 00:36.809
Lady Latimer has come to petition
Your Majesty to lift the suspicion

00:36.910 --> 00:39.979
of treason from her husband.

00:40.080 --> 00:42.815
The King seems quite
taken with Lady Latimer.

00:42.883 --> 00:45.885
You have no children and
none by your first husband?

00:45.986 --> 00:47.687
It was not a happy marriage.

00:47.721 --> 00:51.824
- Do you think such a thing exists?
- Yes, with all my heart.

00:51.892 --> 00:55.461
We should start hunting
down all the Lutherans

00:55.495 --> 00:58.698
in His Majesty's kingdom.
We should flush them out?

00:58.799 --> 01:03.002
Some of them are very close to the King.
You would not like

01:03.103 --> 01:05.004
to be Queen of England? - No!

01:05.038 --> 01:08.674
You know what happens to his Queens!
Everyone knows what happens.

01:08.742 --> 01:11.177
Let it be known to all
present that this treaty

01:11.244 --> 01:14.880
contains an obligation to
undertake a war against France.

01:14.982 --> 01:19.218
His Majesty agrees to send 40,
000 men-at-arms.

01:19.286 --> 01:24.156
I do, so help me God. - What could make
a revengeful prince like the Emperor

01:24.224 --> 01:26.492
forget the insult done to
him by the King of England?

01:26.526 --> 01:30.329
Those insults are long forgotten,
Monsieur Marillac. - Catherine Parr,

01:30.397 --> 01:32.932
we are sent here by the
King's Majesty to offer you

01:33.033 --> 01:37.336
His Majesty's hand in marriage. He will
be the happiest man now alive in
England,

01:37.371 --> 01:41.107
and you the happiest woman.

02:59.619 --> 03:04.957
My Lords, we will now proceed with
our plans for an invasion of France.

03:05.092 --> 03:08.794
We will start by the capture of
the strategic town of Boulogne.

03:08.862 --> 03:12.298
Your Grace, I shall appoint you

03:12.365 --> 03:16.669
commander of our armies, if you have
the will and the stomach for the fight.

03:16.770 --> 03:21.874
Majesty, I can only thank God for the
chance to win honour and glory in the
field,

03:21.975 --> 03:25.478
for what man would not prefer to die
with a sword in his hand and a cry in
his throat...

03:25.579 --> 03:28.481
Aye. -...rather than
abed in England.

03:28.582 --> 03:31.450
- Aye.
- Aye!

03:31.518 --> 03:34.820
My Lords, I must tell you

03:34.921 --> 03:37.289
that a special envoy from
the court of the Emperor,

03:37.357 --> 03:41.127
the Duke of Najera,
will pay us an unofficial visit,

03:41.161 --> 03:44.463
in honour of our alliance.

03:44.531 --> 03:47.433
The Duke is one of the Emperor's
most successful generals.

03:47.501 --> 03:49.969
He should be first received
here by the Earl of Surrey

03:50.003 --> 03:52.838
and then brought to court.

03:52.939 --> 03:56.675
I'm sure your lordships will
welcome him as he deserves.

03:56.776 --> 04:00.613
I have vowed to bring King
Francis into submission,

04:00.680 --> 04:04.650
and I will fulfil this promise.

04:04.718 --> 04:07.386
I have been all my life a
prince of virtue and honour,

04:07.487 --> 04:10.156
as you can all attest,

04:10.223 --> 04:12.691
and I have never
contravened my word.

04:12.792 --> 04:17.829
I'm too old to begin now.

04:20.666 --> 04:22.668
I, Catherine

04:22.736 --> 04:27.473
take thee, Henry,
to be my wedded husband,

04:27.541 --> 04:32.511
to have and to hold
from this day forward,

04:32.579 --> 04:37.049
for better, for worse,
for richer, for poorer,

04:37.150 --> 04:40.186
in sickness and in health,

04:40.253 --> 04:45.424
to be bonaire and buxom
in bed and at board,

04:45.525 --> 04:48.527
till death us do part,

04:48.562 --> 04:53.532
and thereto I plight
thee my troth.

04:55.735 --> 04:58.871
The ring.

05:01.274 --> 05:07.846
<i>Benedicat, hic anulum, dominus,
qui fecit caelum et terram.</i>

05:15.021 --> 05:18.390
With this ring, I thee wed.

05:18.491 --> 05:20.226
With my body,

05:20.327 --> 05:23.562
I thee worship.

05:23.663 --> 05:30.603
<i>In nomine Patris, et Filii,
et Spiritus Sancti.</i>

05:30.704 --> 05:34.006
I now pronounce
thee man and wife.

06:13.113 --> 06:15.047
Thank you, Lady Herbert.

06:15.115 --> 06:18.417
Majesty.

06:21.221 --> 06:24.123
Sister.

06:24.224 --> 06:27.226
Your Majesty.

06:35.468 --> 06:37.770
Your Majesty, if I may?

06:37.904 --> 06:39.738
Uh-huh.

06:39.873 --> 06:45.878
I am determined to be a loving
stepmother to your children.

06:45.912 --> 06:48.714
Of course, I have known
the Lady Mary for years,

06:48.815 --> 06:52.584
but it would now be my
pleasure rather than

06:52.652 --> 06:56.755
my duty to make friends with the Prince
Edward and the Princess Elizabeth.

06:56.823 --> 07:00.592
So with Your
Majesty's permission

07:00.660 --> 07:03.595
I would like to invite
them more often to court,

07:03.663 --> 07:10.569
not only for my sake but so they
might more often see their father.

07:10.637 --> 07:13.405
You have my permission.

07:13.440 --> 07:17.042
Thank you.

07:19.979 --> 07:22.881
And perhaps Your Majesty
might also agree

07:22.949 --> 07:27.553
to the Lady Elizabeth having permanent
lodgings at court, like the Lady Mary?

07:31.424 --> 07:36.395
Perhaps. But I would not like my son
Edward to come to court too often,

07:36.463 --> 07:38.697
for fear he may catch infection.

07:42.635 --> 07:46.572
I have arranged for some
gifts to be delivered to you.

07:46.639 --> 07:50.042
I hope you like them.

07:50.110 --> 07:53.212
Thank you.

07:54.981 --> 07:59.051
You're welcome.

08:06.493 --> 08:08.494
Try this one, Your Grace.

08:12.165 --> 08:15.067
- Your Grace.
- My Lords.

08:15.135 --> 08:19.772
I am pleased to convey to you
His Majesty's commissions.

08:19.806 --> 08:22.775
Sir Thomas, you are
recalled from Brussels

08:22.809 --> 08:25.077
and are to be appointed
Admiral of the Fleet.

08:25.145 --> 08:30.949
My Lord Surrey, the King has seen fit
to make you Marshal of the Field, a
singular honour.

08:31.084 --> 08:36.955
- Your Grace. - When do we sail?
- As soon as the King commands.

08:37.090 --> 08:39.691
Sir Thomas...

08:42.328 --> 08:47.966
...is it true that Lord Hertford, is
against this war? - It is true, Your
Grace.

08:48.034 --> 08:50.636
He worries for the
King's health,

08:50.670 --> 08:52.604
in body and in mind.

08:52.672 --> 08:55.607
He fears that if His Majesty
should die in France,

08:55.675 --> 08:58.677
he would leave the kingdom
in great confusion.

08:58.778 --> 09:00.879
How is the King?

09:00.980 --> 09:04.850
There are rumours
that he is unwell.

09:04.951 --> 09:07.853
That he may be unable
to lead the army.

09:07.954 --> 09:11.190
Oh no, my Lord. The King will lead his
soldiers. Make no mistake of that.

09:11.291 --> 09:16.195
For here is the truth: the King
does not just want France back,

09:16.296 --> 09:20.365
but all of his honour
and his youth as well.

09:24.337 --> 09:28.140
And, in that, he is like me.

09:43.156 --> 09:49.328
Your Majesty, may I present His
Highness Don Juan Estaban Manrique de
Lara,

09:49.362 --> 09:51.797
Duke of Najera.

09:53.633 --> 09:55.501
Your Highness.

09:55.635 --> 09:57.803
Your Majesty.

09:57.837 --> 09:59.805
I am very happy to
receive you at my court.

09:59.839 --> 10:03.876
I trust you have been
well entertained so far?

10:07.180 --> 10:10.582
Indeed. I have visited
the famous Tower

10:10.683 --> 10:12.718
and also the River Thames.

10:12.752 --> 10:16.588
In my opinion, it is not possible that
a more beautiful river should exist in
the world.

10:16.689 --> 10:21.693
<i>And with so many... cisnes? - Swans,
your Highness.</i>

10:21.728 --> 10:23.896
Yes. Swans.

10:23.963 --> 10:27.699
My Lord Surrey also
took His Highness

10:27.767 --> 10:32.538
to the Paris Gardens,
to see bears fighting with dogs.

10:32.605 --> 10:34.506
And then, in the same place,

10:34.574 --> 10:36.775
they brought a pony
with an ape on his back!

10:36.910 --> 10:39.177
And to see the animal
kicking among the dogs,

10:39.212 --> 10:44.016
with the screams of the ape was
very laughable. Ha! Ha! Ha!

10:44.050 --> 10:48.220
Well, Your Highness, I trust this
evening you will also be well
entertained

10:48.288 --> 10:53.525
by my beautiful wife the Queen and
my first daughter, the Lady Mary.

11:02.936 --> 11:05.904
His Highness only desires
Your Majesty to confirm

11:05.939 --> 11:08.574
if your armies are ready
for the invasion of France.

11:08.641 --> 11:10.742
I have already given my word.

11:10.810 --> 11:14.880
What more does Your
Highness expect of me?

11:30.463 --> 11:36.034
His Highness,
the Duke of Najera.

11:36.135 --> 11:39.338
*

11:54.420 --> 11:57.089
Your Highness.

11:57.156 --> 11:59.925
Your Majesty.

12:00.026 --> 12:03.295
The Lady Mary.

12:48.307 --> 12:52.878
So, is it a coincidence
that there is talk of war

12:52.979 --> 12:56.882
and then General Najera
turns up here at court?

12:56.949 --> 12:58.884
Absolutely.

12:58.918 --> 13:00.752
This is a private visit.

13:00.887 --> 13:04.756
His Highness came to
London to see the Tower

13:04.791 --> 13:06.591
and row on the river

13:06.626 --> 13:11.229
and see the swans.
Do you take me for a fool?

13:11.264 --> 13:13.432
No, Excellency.

13:13.466 --> 13:19.271
You are what you are.
And so am I.

13:21.808 --> 13:25.811
- Kat! May I not dance? Please!
- Of course you can!

13:25.912 --> 13:27.946
Of course you can dance,
my Lady.

13:45.131 --> 13:50.469
Mr. Risley, may I ask: what have you
heard of the Queen's religious beliefs?

13:50.536 --> 13:52.437
They are the same, surely,

13:52.505 --> 13:56.842
as His Majesty's? - I think not.
Indeed, I suspect Her Majesty

13:56.943 --> 14:01.446
of being a secret Protestant and
I intend one day to prove it.

14:01.481 --> 14:06.151
And in so doing risk
the anger of the King?

14:06.185 --> 14:10.689
Mr. Risley,
for the sake of our faith,

14:10.790 --> 14:12.691
and the future of our country

14:12.792 --> 14:16.661
I am prepared to
risk a great deal.

14:30.176 --> 14:34.146
Dr. Butts! What is it?

14:34.180 --> 14:38.150
It's the King's leg, Your Majesty. His
ulcer has burst. He is in great pain.

14:38.184 --> 14:39.818
Come.

14:41.721 --> 14:48.994
Catherine! - Dearest,
let me see! - Please, don't.

14:58.771 --> 15:03.608
I have seen worse things.
Give me a poultice. Quickly now.

15:03.709 --> 15:06.778
If Your Majesty could
move your leg...

15:06.879 --> 15:10.382
and place it across my lap?

15:12.351 --> 15:16.721
There, dearest. Quickly!

15:25.231 --> 15:29.201
As long as the King is sick,
I will move my bed to his chamber,

15:29.268 --> 15:33.905
the better to look
after him. - Madam.

15:36.342 --> 15:41.913
- Next!
- Steady! Forward.

15:42.048 --> 15:44.716
Come on, lads.

15:44.784 --> 15:47.085
I went to war once,
a long time ago.

15:47.153 --> 15:49.421
We broke lances
against the French;

15:49.488 --> 15:53.091
the knights did in
the old days. This...

15:53.226 --> 15:57.462
Steady. -...this is a
different war: a war of guns.

15:57.563 --> 16:01.766
- Oh!
- Good shot. - Again.

16:16.449 --> 16:20.285
- Good shooting. - Well done.

16:20.419 --> 16:22.454
What's your name? - Richard,
Your Grace.

16:22.488 --> 16:26.124
Richard Leland. - You are
soon to war, Richard Leland.

16:26.192 --> 16:28.193
Next.

16:31.530 --> 16:34.299
Hey! That was well done,
Richard.

16:34.333 --> 16:36.835
Harry. Harry Hurst.

16:36.936 --> 16:38.803
- Are you coming to France?
- I don't know.

16:38.871 --> 16:42.307
I can't shoot like that.
What can you do?

16:42.375 --> 16:46.811
I'm a farm labourer, me. I can herd
cows, shovel shit, and build fences.

16:46.879 --> 16:51.483
Christ! I wish I'd half
your talent, Harry! Ha!

16:51.617 --> 16:54.753
- Thank you.
- You there! Next.

16:54.820 --> 16:57.322
Your Majesty,

16:57.390 --> 16:59.658
Prince Edward is here.

16:59.792 --> 17:01.760
Oh!

17:08.733 --> 17:10.669
Madam.

17:10.803 --> 17:15.507
Your Grace.
How lovely to see you.

17:15.540 --> 17:20.345
Madam, I came to thank you for
the outfits of crimson velvet

17:20.378 --> 17:22.981
and white satin you sent me.

17:23.015 --> 17:27.218
Well, I am very glad
that you liked them.

17:27.319 --> 17:30.221
I would also like to thank my
noble and illustrious father

17:30.323 --> 17:36.161
for the jewels he sent me.
But they told me he was sick.

17:36.195 --> 17:41.366
Well, I am pleased to tell Your Grace
that His Majesty is now much better.

17:46.038 --> 17:52.177
He must love me. For if he did not love
me, he would not give me these fine
gifts.

17:52.211 --> 17:58.183
He loves you very much.
You are very special

17:58.250 --> 18:01.419
to him and I know
that he would like

18:01.554 --> 18:03.722
to see you more
often if he could.

18:03.789 --> 18:06.558
Thank you.

18:06.592 --> 18:11.363
I wish you a good day, Madam.

18:19.805 --> 18:22.907
Poor child.

18:25.444 --> 18:27.379
My Lords.

18:27.446 --> 18:31.149
How go our preparations?
I think they have gone slackly!

18:31.283 --> 18:33.785
I'm beginning to suppose

18:33.853 --> 18:38.256
your lordships are not so keen
to go to war after all. Sit.

18:40.259 --> 18:43.762
Majesty, the gun carriages,
carts, wagons,

18:43.796 --> 18:47.766
the ovens, horses, artillery, and
ordnance are all made ready and
dispatched for shipping.

18:47.800 --> 18:50.735
And a further 300 ships
have been requisitioned

18:50.803 --> 18:54.406
for Your Majesty's use and will be in
port within the month. - Within the
month!

18:54.473 --> 18:58.009
They should be already in port
if you had not been so remiss

18:58.110 --> 19:01.613
and neglectful in your duties! Your
Grace, what about our maps of Boulogne?

19:01.680 --> 19:05.984
Your Majesty,
we do not have any maps,

19:06.085 --> 19:07.952
so we will have to
rely on the advice

19:08.020 --> 19:10.955
of a French spy, de Buren.

19:11.023 --> 19:15.460
So we are to blunder about in the dark
and trust to the honesty of French
spies!

19:15.494 --> 19:17.829
God help us, Your Grace,

19:17.930 --> 19:19.798
for it seems you have not!

19:21.834 --> 19:25.103
We will not wait for more ships!

19:25.137 --> 19:30.141
This army will embark for France
in 10 days time, land in Calais,

19:30.209 --> 19:32.143
and straight away
march to Boulogne.

19:32.178 --> 19:37.015
We have three weeks to take this
town before we proceed on to Paris.

19:37.116 --> 19:42.987
Now, while I am in France,
the Queen's Highness,

19:43.055 --> 19:45.023
Queen Catherine,
will act as Regent

19:45.124 --> 19:48.026
and rule in my stead.

19:48.127 --> 19:50.829
Lord Hertford, who I begin to
suspect is against this war,

19:50.896 --> 19:53.465
will stay as Lieutenant
to the Realm. Now,

19:53.499 --> 19:58.536
need I remind your lordships that we go
to France not solely for honour and
glory,

19:58.637 --> 20:01.940
but to recover our just
rights and inheritances

20:02.007 --> 20:06.978
taken from us by violence and
withheld from us for too long.

20:07.012 --> 20:09.347
- Yes, Your Majesty.
- Your Majesty.

20:14.720 --> 20:17.689
Your Majesty.

20:27.867 --> 20:32.203
He has made the Queen Regent!

20:32.338 --> 20:37.909
Why? She has no knowledge of
matters of state! - I do not know.

20:38.010 --> 20:39.878
But from what I hear of her,
I do not think it right.

20:39.945 --> 20:43.214
I think the King should be aware

20:43.282 --> 20:45.216
how perilous a matter it is

20:45.351 --> 20:48.353
to cherish a serpent
in one's own bosom.

20:56.228 --> 21:00.431
Catherine, I have to
tell yos here in order,

21:00.533 --> 21:03.201
in case do not come
back from France.

21:04.870 --> 21:09.507
Shortly, Parliament will
pass a new Act of Succession,

21:09.542 --> 21:12.510
naming my son Edward as my heir.

21:12.545 --> 21:15.547
If he has no issue,

21:15.614 --> 21:21.019
then it passes to the Lady Mary
and then to the Lady Elizabeth.

21:21.053 --> 21:23.021
Those are my wishes.

21:23.055 --> 21:26.858
Understood.

21:33.599 --> 21:35.533
Do not cry, Mary,

21:35.668 --> 21:38.703
for I do not intend to die.

21:49.782 --> 21:52.717
Promise you will
write to me often!

21:52.785 --> 21:59.691
Tell me all that happens in my kingdom
and whatever you see fit to write.

22:13.572 --> 22:17.075
I leave my children
in your care,

22:17.142 --> 22:21.412
knowing that there are not more
loving hands in this world.

22:25.384 --> 22:27.452
Farewell.

23:14.700 --> 23:19.003
It makes you happy to be alive,
doesn't it, Majesty?

23:20.973 --> 23:23.074
- Yah!
- Yah!

23:26.245 --> 23:28.246
Whoa!

23:28.347 --> 23:32.016
- Your Grace.
- Majesty.

23:32.084 --> 23:34.018
Well met!

23:34.086 --> 23:36.421
How do we prosper?

23:36.488 --> 23:40.692
Majesty, the port is blockaded and the
town is already partially invested.

23:40.759 --> 23:43.695
Its gates are shut and its
defenders shut inside.

23:43.796 --> 23:46.964
I have been told the French consider
that their strong ramparts and double
walls

23:46.999 --> 23:50.802
make them invulnerable
to our artillery!

23:50.836 --> 23:52.770
Well, we shall see about that!

23:52.838 --> 23:55.873
We have brought enough
cannon here to conquer hell!

23:55.941 --> 24:00.945
Yeah! - Forward!

24:31.076 --> 24:37.248
I can't believe my eyes! Look, Richard!
It's the King of England himself!

24:37.383 --> 24:42.387
What do you think? - I reckon if I
were the French I'd be fucking scared.

24:42.421 --> 24:47.392
Englishmen, today you have
every reason to be proud!

24:47.459 --> 24:51.396
Today, we begin our
campaign of Boulogne.

24:51.463 --> 24:54.999
- Yeah!
- We have offered terms of peace

24:55.067 --> 24:58.569
in return for our just
rights and inheritances.

24:58.637 --> 25:04.208
Just rights! - But our enemy has
refused to render what they owe us.

25:04.309 --> 25:07.912
They should know that we do not

25:07.980 --> 25:10.915
lack the courage to fight
to the death for justice.

25:10.983 --> 25:15.553
These lands were taken from us

25:15.621 --> 25:19.557
by violence and I mean to have
them back. - We'll take them back!

25:19.591 --> 25:26.297
For King Henry, for England,
and for St. George!

25:29.334 --> 25:32.370
- Long live the King!
- Yeah!

25:32.471 --> 25:34.372
For England!

25:39.545 --> 25:41.479
<i>Ne tirez pas encore!</i>

25:41.580 --> 25:44.849
<i>Reculez derriÃ¨re les murs!</i>

25:44.950 --> 25:47.585
Prepare your fire!

25:49.755 --> 25:52.123
Solders, to your stations!

25:52.257 --> 25:56.661
Section One Commander!
Prepare your guns!

25:56.728 --> 26:00.932
Section One, prepare your guns!

26:04.603 --> 26:07.705
Section Two Commander!
Prepare your guns!

26:07.773 --> 26:09.774
Load your cannon!

26:14.646 --> 26:16.814
- Prepare your guns!
- Ready, guns.

26:16.882 --> 26:20.318
Section Three Commander!
Prepare your guns!

26:22.287 --> 26:28.793
Ram barrel! - Soldiers,
into the trenches! - Quick march!

26:28.861 --> 26:31.863
Section Two Commander,
take both your men!

26:47.779 --> 26:50.515
Section Three Commander,
report when ready. - Yes, sir!

26:50.616 --> 26:53.017
- Section Three ready.
- That's ready, sir.

26:53.085 --> 26:58.990
All guns take aim for the gates and
castle. - Section One, take aim!

26:59.057 --> 27:02.927
- Section Commanders! - Take aim!
- Confirm you have your target!

27:03.028 --> 27:07.932
- Section Three, take aim.
- Section One, target ready.

27:08.033 --> 27:11.002
Section Two, confirm target.

27:11.036 --> 27:16.874
Section Two, ready! - Section
Two has target, sir. Take aim!

27:17.009 --> 27:20.878
- Section Three, confirm.
- Section Three ready.

27:20.946 --> 27:26.817
Hold sections! Hold fire until I
give the order! - Let's go, men.

27:26.885 --> 27:33.324
- Hold fire! Move!
- Hold your fire! - Move!

27:33.425 --> 27:40.031
- Hold your fire!
- Easy for the time!

27:40.132 --> 27:46.203
Now we'll see how invulnerable
it really is! - In position!

27:46.271 --> 27:49.373
Ready, captain!

28:15.434 --> 28:17.868
Section one, fire!

28:21.440 --> 28:25.710
- For the King!
- Ready! - Ready!

28:34.620 --> 28:38.556
All sections, fire!

28:38.657 --> 28:40.691
Section One, fire!

29:15.060 --> 29:16.927
Ready!

29:24.536 --> 29:27.171
Charge the gun!

29:29.875 --> 29:34.945
- England!
- England! - England!

29:35.047 --> 29:38.949
For England!

29:44.356 --> 29:49.193
Back into position!
Reload all guns!

29:49.261 --> 29:55.199
If you could see that this is
delivered to my Lord Hertford.

29:55.333 --> 29:58.335
Thank you. - Majesty.

30:03.542 --> 30:08.312
Madam, here is Mr. Latimer.

30:08.380 --> 30:10.081
Your Grace.

30:10.148 --> 30:14.852
Alas, Madam, I am no longer
entitled to such an address.

30:14.920 --> 30:18.389
I was deprived of my
bishopric by Bishop Gardiner.

30:18.523 --> 30:22.359
I know. And I know the
circumstances of it.

30:22.494 --> 30:28.265
Still, I have a mind to appoint
you chaplain to my household.

30:28.366 --> 30:34.205
Are you absolutely sure,
my Lady? You must know my reputation.

30:34.339 --> 30:38.509
Your reputation, Mr.
Latimer, is of a man of the Gospels

30:38.577 --> 30:42.279
and a true Christian.

30:42.380 --> 30:45.916
For example, do you suppose
that it is a bad thing

30:46.017 --> 30:49.687
that everyone in England should be
able to read the Bible for themselves?

30:49.755 --> 30:53.224
No. On the contrary,
I believe it

30:53.291 --> 30:58.229
to be a vital thing. For without God's
direct word we that be unlettered

30:58.296 --> 31:00.865
remain confused
and without grace.

31:00.932 --> 31:06.570
Even though some would say that the
reading of the Bible leads to heresy?

31:06.638 --> 31:12.143
If they say so, then they are wickedly
charging the holy sanctified word of God

31:12.244 --> 31:14.211
with the offences of man.

31:14.246 --> 31:20.251
You are right. Do people deny
themselves food, because they see
others overeat?

31:20.285 --> 31:24.421
Or avoid using fire because they have
seen a neighbour's house burn down?

31:24.456 --> 31:29.593
Oh blind ignorance, Mr. Latimer,
to slander God for man's offences.

31:29.661 --> 31:35.232
Madam, if you are still
of a mind to have me,

31:35.300 --> 31:38.936
I will most joyfully
be your chaplain.

31:39.037 --> 31:42.907
I thank you.

31:42.974 --> 31:46.277
I have one favour,

31:46.378 --> 31:51.248
which is that you conceal the true
workings of your mind from the Lady
Mary.

31:51.316 --> 31:56.053
For nothing in this world will change
her allegiance to the faith of her
mother,

31:56.121 --> 31:58.422
and I respect her for that.

31:58.456 --> 32:03.661
Madam, believe me, I shall be the
soul of discretion in my dealings with

32:03.762 --> 32:05.763
all His Majesty's children,

32:05.897 --> 32:09.066
and with the world. - Thank you.

32:13.004 --> 32:15.639
My Lady.

32:20.946 --> 32:23.080
Sister,

32:23.114 --> 32:28.018
are you sure you can really trust Mr.
Latimer's discretion?

32:28.119 --> 32:34.792
I know I should not say
so to Your Majesty,

32:34.826 --> 32:36.660
but I fear his appointment.

32:36.761 --> 32:38.629
Should I play the coward?

32:38.697 --> 32:45.202
Anne, you know that I never
wanted to marry the King.

32:45.303 --> 32:50.875
But since I had to, I may at least
use what influence I now possess

32:50.976 --> 32:54.311
to further the cause that I
believe in with all my heart.

32:54.379 --> 33:01.619
The cause of the Reformation! Then at
least I can address my God with a clear
conscience

33:01.653 --> 33:06.857
and an honest soul. Please say
that you understand, Anne!

33:06.958 --> 33:09.994
Please.

33:16.067 --> 33:18.869
Forward! Come on! Left, right.

33:19.004 --> 33:21.639
There we are!

33:28.413 --> 33:31.849
- Shit!
- It can't last forever.

33:31.917 --> 33:37.021
Lads, come here!

33:40.625 --> 33:43.827
Come on! Move on, men!

33:48.900 --> 33:52.002
This way, my Lord.

33:55.507 --> 34:00.844
Your Majesty, Senor Treviso.
Girolamo. - Your Majesty.

34:00.879 --> 34:04.848
Come, show me where you
intend to dig these mines.

34:04.883 --> 34:07.851
I intend to dig three tunnels.

34:07.919 --> 34:10.187
Two will be a diversion,
to confuse the enemy.

34:10.255 --> 34:14.425
The main one will be here, at the town
wall, which will lead directly under
the castle.

34:14.525 --> 34:16.726
- How long will it take?
- That depends on many things:

34:16.761 --> 34:18.728
the type of ground,
danger of flooding, and so on.

34:18.763 --> 34:22.032
Also, how far into the earth
they have built the walls.

34:22.067 --> 34:23.967
But I say we could
be under the castle

34:24.069 --> 34:26.737
and able to detonate a huge
explosion in three weeks.

34:26.771 --> 34:31.909
Two weeks,
Senor Treviso! Two weeks!

34:31.976 --> 34:34.078
Take the troops you need.

34:42.887 --> 34:44.922
Put your backs into it, men.

35:27.899 --> 35:29.967
We are making
excellent progress.

35:30.001 --> 35:33.637
But I want to know how the Emperor is
doing since we are in this war together.

35:33.705 --> 35:35.639
Majesty, the Emperor's forces
are at present besieging

35:35.740 --> 35:38.942
the fortresses of
Luxembourg and St. Didier.

35:38.977 --> 35:41.945
With God's help, we will break our
siege first and then advance on Paris.

35:41.980 --> 35:43.280
With the damage our guns
are already inflicting,

35:43.415 --> 35:46.283
I swear Boulogne will
not hold out for long.

35:46.317 --> 35:50.087
I think that the French were foolish to
think that their walls were invincible.

35:50.121 --> 35:52.189
They had not seen our guns.

36:03.535 --> 36:07.204
<i>Avancez. Doucement.</i>

36:17.215 --> 36:20.317
Paris by September! Good,

36:20.385 --> 36:23.287
there are a lot of Frenchmen
in Paris I would like to kill,

36:23.321 --> 36:25.823
so I can sleep with their
wives with a clear conscience!

36:25.957 --> 36:28.826
Gentlemen

36:28.927 --> 36:32.463
<i>- Salut!
- Salut!</i>

36:32.564 --> 36:35.732
- Majesty.
- What is it?

36:35.834 --> 36:39.536
The French! They've broken out beyond
the southern gate, sir. - I'll go!

36:39.637 --> 36:42.673
Your Grace! I want you to cover all
the gates with a massive force,

36:42.807 --> 36:46.577
in case this is a diversion.
Go! - Majesty.

36:56.888 --> 36:59.389
Where are they?

37:03.061 --> 37:06.864
<i>ArrÃªtez! Revenez au
nom du roi!</i>

37:28.253 --> 37:34.691
There, there! Get him!
Stop in the name of the King!

37:34.759 --> 37:37.161
<i>ArrÃªtez!</i>

37:41.432 --> 37:43.867
Where is he?
He's down in the ditch!

38:07.091 --> 38:09.927
Keep your wits about you.

38:14.966 --> 38:19.269
Take cover! - Stay down!

38:19.337 --> 38:24.875
- Do you see him?
- Two on the ground!

38:44.195 --> 38:46.129
<i>A l'attaque!</i>

38:46.197 --> 38:50.000
Ready! Let's go!

38:58.910 --> 39:02.546
Your Grace,

39:02.647 --> 39:05.449
I didn't need your help but
thank you all the same.

39:05.483 --> 39:10.787
<i>Suivez-moi! Pour Boulogne!
A l'attaque!</i>

39:10.855 --> 39:13.890
- Shall I leave them to you then?
- Ah! Here we come!

39:17.662 --> 39:20.030
For England!

40:18.356 --> 40:22.192
<i>Papa! Papa! Papa!</i>

40:22.327 --> 40:29.266
<i>Papa! Papa! Papa, rÃ©veille-toi! Allez,
ouvre tes yeux!</i>

40:43.081 --> 40:45.849
Mademoiselle?

41:01.099 --> 41:03.233
Load cannon!

41:05.370 --> 41:09.740
General. - Keep the lines straight.
Dig in there.

41:16.714 --> 41:19.049
I've brought you some food.

41:25.823 --> 41:27.858
Your father is still alive.

41:32.864 --> 41:35.732
Is that true? - He was wounded
but we're taking care of him.

41:35.800 --> 41:40.404
- Can I see him?
- Soon. I promise.

41:40.438 --> 41:43.140
Put your backs into it.
Roll that barrel!

41:45.109 --> 41:48.044
What's your name?

41:48.079 --> 41:51.915
Brigitte, Brigitte Rousselot.

41:52.049 --> 41:53.650
- Look lively.
- You should eat.

41:53.751 --> 41:58.655
Why are you here? In France?

41:58.756 --> 42:04.227
This isn't your country.
It used to be.

42:04.262 --> 42:07.464
And we all used to live in Eden.
It doesn't mean we can go back again!

42:07.598 --> 42:11.768
Why won't you release me?

42:11.803 --> 42:13.770
So you can go on
fighting against us?

42:13.838 --> 42:17.274
- Yes! So I can go on killing you.
- No, Mademoiselle.

42:17.408 --> 42:21.778
You're my prisoner now.
Perhaps I'll even get a ransom for you!

42:25.817 --> 42:27.951
Can I ask how things
are in the town?

42:28.019 --> 42:30.620
Do people have enough food?

42:30.688 --> 42:34.958
They have plenty! You shouldn't worry
about them. They'll never surrender.

42:34.992 --> 42:39.296
Not to that sacred monster,
your King. - Monster?

42:39.330 --> 42:41.765
<i>Oui! Un monstre!</i>

42:44.001 --> 42:48.972
You know we call him the English Nero!
Didn't you know that?

42:56.481 --> 43:03.854
<i>Dominus tecum. Benedicta
tu in mulieribus,</i>

43:03.988 --> 43:09.392
<i>et benedictus fructus
ventris tui.</i>

43:16.334 --> 43:22.239
- Mr. Risley.
- Your Grace,

43:22.340 --> 43:29.045
I have some news I thought
you might be interested in.

43:29.146 --> 43:33.316
It seems Queen Catherine has appointed
Hugh Latimer as her private Chaplain.

43:33.384 --> 43:35.785
Are you sure?

43:35.853 --> 43:42.959
Yes. - And I thought someone said
she was an intelligent woman!

43:50.234 --> 43:53.136
How's the tunnelling, Harry?

43:53.204 --> 43:56.506
We've dug about 50 paces.

43:56.541 --> 44:00.010
It's bloody hard work;
and there's a lot of clay.

44:00.077 --> 44:02.746
I prefer the clay.
It's not like sand.

44:02.847 --> 44:05.849
Always afraid it's gonna
collapse and bury you.

44:05.917 --> 44:09.386
How've you been?

44:09.487 --> 44:12.355
There's a French officer
comes out sometimes.

44:12.423 --> 44:15.358
He stands for a few moments
on the castle rampart,

44:15.426 --> 44:19.362
looking at us.
Then he goes back inside.

44:19.430 --> 44:26.536
I just need one good shot.
One good shot. - Aye.

44:29.507 --> 44:31.708
Hey, have you heard?

44:31.776 --> 44:34.744
There are meant to be a
few women around camp.

44:34.845 --> 44:39.516
Not many, mind. Just a few.
That's what I heard.

44:39.550 --> 44:41.518
If you fancy the pox!

44:41.552 --> 44:46.523
Aye. Perhaps you're right.

44:46.557 --> 44:53.563
In any case, I have a wife back
home and she is with child.

44:53.631 --> 44:57.734
Oh! What do you
want a boy or girl?

44:57.802 --> 45:00.136
A boy.

45:02.573 --> 45:06.610
I hope to God we're
not here too long.

45:13.250 --> 45:16.720
Although Your Majesty's
absence has not been long,

45:16.754 --> 45:21.091
yet the want of your presence means
that I cannot take pleasure in anything

45:21.125 --> 45:24.728
until I hear from Your Majesty.

45:24.795 --> 45:31.434
Time hangs heavily. I have a great
desire to know how Your Majesty has
done since you left.

45:31.502 --> 45:39.409
For your prosperity and health I
prefer and desire more than my own.

45:39.477 --> 45:43.246
And although I know Your Majesty's
absence is never without great need

45:43.280 --> 45:49.252
still, love and affection compel
me to desire your presence.

45:49.286 --> 45:54.257
Thus love makes me set aside

45:54.325 --> 45:59.329
my own convenience and pleasure for you,
at whose hands I have received

45:59.430 --> 46:04.634
so much love and goodness
that words cannot express it.

46:10.574 --> 46:15.578
We hear word of ill weather
and delays besetting you.

46:15.646 --> 46:20.583
And though we thank God
for your good health,

46:20.718 --> 46:26.589
we anxiously await the joyous news
of the success of your great venture

46:26.657 --> 46:31.594
and for your safe and triumphant return.
More buckets down there!

46:31.662 --> 46:37.934
For which all England offers daily
prayers. - More supports in the space!

46:38.069 --> 46:45.575
I fear I am but
a poor substitute

46:45.643 --> 46:49.245
for Your Majesty in the matter
of the guidance of your kingdom.

46:49.313 --> 46:54.684
I long for your return.

47:00.191 --> 47:03.626
I commit you to God's
care and governance.

47:03.694 --> 47:14.637
By Your Majesty's humble, obedient
wife and servant, Catherine the Queen.

48:49.733 --> 48:52.969
But, Majesty, I beg you to
give us a little more time.

48:53.070 --> 48:55.972
The men are working
all day and all night.

48:56.073 --> 48:59.642
But sometimes we must stop
digging to support the roof

48:59.743 --> 49:02.045
or else everything collapses.

49:02.112 --> 49:05.782
Master Surgeon!

49:05.883 --> 49:10.053
Senor Treviso. - Your Majesty.

49:10.120 --> 49:15.959
- What is it?
- Majesty,

49:16.060 --> 49:20.997
I regret to inform you of the
deaths of ten of your soldiers.

49:21.065 --> 49:27.904
Soldier die of their wounds. - No, Your
Majesty. The men all died of the bloody
flux.

49:27.938 --> 49:30.907
Dysentery?

49:30.941 --> 49:36.579
I am afraid that there is an outbreak
of the disease throughout your army.

49:36.647 --> 49:38.982
God alone knows how
many it will take away.

49:46.257 --> 49:48.591
Master Surgeon.

49:48.659 --> 49:54.764
Mr. Treviso. - Majesty.

49:58.168 --> 50:00.270
Your Majesty.

50:07.578 --> 50:09.946
Let me ask you something:

50:09.980 --> 50:15.285
what do you think of our Italian
gentleman, Senor Girolamo Treviso?

50:15.319 --> 50:18.288
The builder of tunnels.

50:18.355 --> 50:22.292
- What do you mean?
- I mean do you trust him?

50:22.359 --> 50:25.194
Why should I not trust him?

50:25.296 --> 50:28.631
It's only that I happen to
know that, some time ago,

50:28.699 --> 50:31.768
he said he could build
a mirror large enough

50:31.802 --> 50:36.372
that if set upon the cliffs of Dover
His Majesty would be able to see,

50:36.473 --> 50:40.643
reflected in it,
the movement of French ships

50:40.778 --> 50:43.947
in and out of the
port of Boulogne.

50:46.216 --> 50:48.184
Do you see what I mean,
Your Grace?

50:48.285 --> 50:51.020
Do you think he's mad?

50:51.155 --> 50:55.024
It's only a suggestion.

50:55.125 --> 50:59.195
But then, he's not the only one!

51:09.673 --> 51:12.008
Change the watch!

51:12.076 --> 51:16.179
Change the night watch!

51:41.171 --> 51:48.511
- Section ready!
- Pull me up!

51:48.579 --> 51:51.681
Ready captain!
