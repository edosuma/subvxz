of the truck, did I not?

01:24.780 --> 01:25.302

I work two jobs, but,

my Lord, they
shouldn't have to look

01:33.745 --> 01:35.138
at a rolling billboard
in the parking lot.

01:36.531 --> 01:37.749

uh, she's at her wit's end.

01:48.369 --> 01:50.632
Your behavior has been off.

01:52.590 --> 01:54.288

in that classroom today,

will get you there.

just tried it once,

03:16.152 --> 03:17.545

- Can I go to the bathroom?

03:45.616 --> 03:46.400
- Hurry back.

03:49.838 --> 03:51.796
- The Lord looks on the heart.

03:51.970 --> 03:54.538
Now, the GCO guidebook
says no swimming,

03:56.410 --> 04:00.327
no makeup, no worldly music,
no going to the picture show.

04:00.501 --> 04:01.893
- That's right.
- Yes.

04:02.067 --> 04:03.547

a million people

04:03.721 --> 04:06.594
in this organization who
follow those rules to tee.

04:06.768 --> 04:08.204
- I do, Pastor.

Zachary. I know you do.

04:15.472 --> 04:19.389
that are following those
rules on the outside,

04:19.563 --> 04:21.870
but they're doing something
different on the inside?

04:23.698 --> 04:27.876
Right, someone who wouldn't
dare touch a bottle of whiskey,

04:29.747 --> 04:33.055
and yet they walk around
drunk on their own pride.

04:33.229 --> 04:34.839
[congregation muttering]

04:35.013 --> 04:35.927
God looks on the heart.

04:39.801 --> 04:41.933
about lighting up

burnt up with jealousy.

04:49.027 --> 04:51.552
[congregation muttering]

04:51.726 --> 04:52.509
See, because God,

04:54.729 --> 04:56.034
he knows how to spot a fake.

04:57.819 --> 05:01.649
And if we don't tell him
every single day how we fail,

05:01.823 --> 05:02.693
and we need his help,

05:04.478 --> 05:07.132
then our own hearts
will go astray.

05:07.307 --> 05:08.830
- Oh yes.
- Amen.

fails and where people fail,

God will never, and
I mean never fail.

41:29.791 --> 41:31.358
You know, basically,
he says that

41:32.881 --> 41:35.623
nothing can separate you
from the love of God.

41:35.797 --> 41:37.625
- Yeah.
- Praise the Lord.

41:37.799 --> 41:38.670
- No sin.

41:39.801 --> 41:40.715
No failure.

41:42.108 --> 41:42.891
Nothing.

41:45.154 --> 41:46.852
Nothing can separate
you from that love.

41:50.333 --> 41:53.162
[audience applauding]

41:57.776 --> 41:59.473
- And he, um,

41:59.647 --> 42:04.173
well, he just moved us from
place to place about every year.

42:05.784 --> 42:07.699
Well, I woulda been to
like 13 different schools

42:07.873 --> 42:09.918
before I graduated two
years ago, and it's...

42:12.442 --> 42:13.748
- It must've been hard for you.

42:15.010 --> 42:15.750
- Yeah.

42:19.667 --> 42:21.495
I mean, the hardest
part was just,

42:23.541 --> 42:26.108
uh, never knowing which Daddy

42:26.282 --> 42:28.067
was gonna walk through
the door at night,

42:29.372 --> 42:30.330
the one that would, um,

42:32.811 --> 42:34.029
show up drunk and beat us,

42:34.203 --> 42:35.335
or the one he was

42:37.511 --> 42:39.774
always saying how sorry he was?

42:39.948 --> 42:41.646
- I'll never imagine
going through all that.

42:43.256 --> 42:44.562
Y'all seemed so happy.

42:49.218 --> 42:51.090
- Well, Ray and I
were always happy.

42:51.264 --> 42:52.657
[chuckles] We, um,

42:52.831 --> 42:55.311
nah, no, we had
this, uh, this place.

42:57.270 --> 42:58.488
We call it the Angels Trail.

42:58.663 --> 42:59.751
Yeah, and, um,

43:01.100 --> 43:04.233
we would go there to
pray when it got bad.

43:06.627 --> 43:08.107
And church was all we had, so.

43:10.457 --> 43:12.459
And I, [chuckles]

43:12.633 --> 43:17.029
I've, I've never told
anyone else all this before.

43:21.860 --> 43:22.774
- You're beautiful.

43:25.124 --> 43:25.733
Inside and out.

43:28.910 --> 43:29.650
- Oh.

43:31.086 --> 43:31.826
Thank you.

43:34.437 --> 43:36.091
Uh...

43:36.265 --> 43:38.267
I've never met someone like you.

43:45.057 --> 43:47.799
[Samuel chuckles]

43:48.669 --> 43:50.671
- You drank two milkshakes.

43:50.845 --> 43:53.152
- Ah! You kept count?

43:53.326 --> 43:55.633
- I was just, I was nervous you
were gonna try and get mine.

43:55.807 --> 43:57.635
So how am I gonna pay
for all these milkshakes?

43:59.245 --> 44:00.594
- Well, I think if
you pay for them,

44:00.768 --> 44:02.248
then that would
make this a date.

44:03.466 --> 44:04.424
- Is that a promise?

44:04.598 --> 44:06.861
- [giggles] I think so.

44:08.297 --> 44:09.864
- Ah, excuse me.

44:10.038 --> 44:11.126
Can I get the,

44:11.300 --> 44:15.653
the check?
[Julie laughs]

44:15.827 --> 44:17.655
I'll keep that sticker
on my guitar 'cause

44:19.134 --> 44:20.440
it reminded me of
the life I knew

44:20.614 --> 44:22.050
I was supposed to be living.

44:24.400 --> 44:25.706
I thought about you,

44:25.880 --> 44:27.447
and I was certain
I lost the chance

44:27.621 --> 44:28.970
to love someone
as special as you.

44:32.539 --> 44:34.062
Julie, I wanna build
a life with you.

44:35.324 --> 44:36.108
And we,

44:37.936 --> 44:40.025
we could build a
different kinda church,

44:40.199 --> 44:42.288
from scratch, our own.

44:42.462 --> 44:43.419
Not about a bunch of

44:44.769 --> 44:45.857
manmade rules.

44:48.642 --> 44:50.688
One that reaches people
as lost as I was,

44:52.341 --> 44:54.039
built on grace.

44:54.213 --> 44:55.344
- That's a beautiful dream.

44:57.346 --> 44:58.260
But, um,

45:00.654 --> 45:04.310
I mean, did I, did I miss a
question in there somewhere?

45:06.225 --> 45:07.443
- [Samuel] Yeah, maybe.

45:07.617 --> 45:10.272
[both giggling]
[gentle music]

45:10.446 --> 45:11.665
The last few years I,

45:13.972 --> 45:16.365
[Samuel sighs]

45:17.627 --> 45:18.933
I haven't been a good man, but

45:21.631 --> 45:22.850
you make me wanna be.

45:25.853 --> 45:27.986
And maybe when we
build that church,

45:28.160 --> 45:29.901
you'd like to be by my side.

45:33.948 --> 45:34.732
As my wife.

45:36.168 --> 45:39.388
[gentle music continues]

45:43.436 --> 45:45.090
[somber music]

45:45.264 --> 45:47.440
- Well, my daddy, he...

45:47.614 --> 45:49.355
- [Samuel] What about him?

45:49.529 --> 45:53.707
[somber music continues]

45:53.881 --> 45:55.535
- Sam, he won't let me
just start a life with you.

45:55.709 --> 45:56.492
I mean,

45:57.798 --> 45:58.756
God, he'd kill me.

46:00.714 --> 46:02.411
He said that I can't just leave.

46:04.674 --> 46:06.633
- He ain't gonna kill anybody.

46:11.594 --> 46:12.160
Julie, look at me.

46:15.076 --> 46:16.774
Your best days are
in front of you.

46:18.427 --> 46:20.125
And that man will
never touch you again.

46:24.912 --> 46:27.132
- He's violent, Samuel, and
you're, you're so sweet,

46:27.306 --> 46:28.437
but you just, you
don't know him.

46:28.611 --> 46:29.656
- I know myself.

46:30.788 --> 46:31.832
He'd have to kill me.

46:35.314 --> 46:35.923
- You're serious?

46:37.707 --> 46:38.752
- Do I look like I'm not?

46:46.716 --> 46:49.067
- Well, the answer is yes.

46:49.241 --> 46:51.678
[gentle music]

46:55.377 --> 46:57.336
[bright music]

46:57.510 --> 47:02.210
- [Samuel] I guess I
owe you a ring, then.

47:02.384 --> 47:04.778
- You know, I always knew
we'd get married someday.

47:06.736 --> 47:09.478
- I thought you were
gonna marry Jody Barnes.

47:09.652 --> 47:10.915
- Well, yes. Him or you.

47:11.089 --> 47:14.048
[both laughing]

[bright music continues]

47:22.665 --> 47:24.580
[congregation applauding]

47:24.754 --> 47:26.844
- Give the Lord a praise.

47:31.892 --> 47:34.199
It's good to be here

47:34.373 --> 47:35.983
in God's Church Sayre.

47:36.157 --> 47:37.985
- [Congregation] Amen.

47:38.159 --> 47:39.944
- Brother Joe

47:40.118 --> 47:44.078
has preached many fine
messages from this pulpit.

47:45.993 --> 47:49.867
And I am sad that he
has chosen to retire.

47:51.433 --> 47:56.047
But, uh, I do believe that
Brother Malachi from Louisiana

47:56.743 --> 47:58.397
has done a fine job

47:58.571 --> 48:00.138
as a interim

48:00.312 --> 48:01.704
pastor,

48:01.879 --> 48:04.882
and I'm sure that he
will do a fine job

48:05.056 --> 48:07.232
as a permanent pastor.

48:07.406 --> 48:08.668
- All Right.
- Amen.

48:10.235 --> 48:13.629
- But not ever pastor is
like Brother Joe Allen.

48:14.804 --> 48:17.329
He has remained faithful.

48:18.852 --> 48:21.463
Now, I understand
that he doesn't

48:21.637 --> 48:23.465
want to come up here today.

48:23.639 --> 48:25.380
I understand that.

48:25.554 --> 48:27.774
But his son Samuel is here.

48:29.384 --> 48:32.735
And boy, have I been
hearing some things

48:32.910 --> 48:35.347
about this young man

48:35.521 --> 48:36.870
and the call

48:37.740 --> 48:39.351
that's on his life.

48:41.309 --> 48:42.049
Samuel,

48:44.312 --> 48:48.142
would you come up here and share
a little bit with us today?

48:49.839 --> 48:51.058
- All right, preacher man.

48:54.801 --> 48:58.109
[congregation applauding]

49:04.680 --> 49:08.597
- If I can't hear my favorite
pastor, I wanna hear his son.

49:08.771 --> 49:10.164
- [Congregation] Yeah.

49:10.338 --> 49:14.081
- Thank you.
[congregation applauding]

49:14.255 --> 49:15.213
Thanks.

49:15.387 --> 49:17.955
A little over a year ago, um,

49:19.304 --> 49:22.089
I was in a motel room in
Charlotte after a show.

49:23.699 --> 49:24.787
I was

49:24.962 --> 49:25.963
high on cocaine.

49:28.487 --> 49:29.183
I was

49:30.402 --> 49:31.969
with a woman I had just met.

49:33.492 --> 49:37.452
$1,000 on the dresser.
Just cut my first record.

49:37.626 --> 49:38.976
But I was

49:39.150 --> 49:40.934
dying inside.

49:42.457 --> 49:43.937
No, no, no, I know we don't,

49:44.111 --> 49:45.417
we don't talk about this
kinda stuff in church.

49:45.591 --> 49:48.115
But I don't know why.

49:51.684 --> 49:55.209
I knew my life was broken. I
just didn't know how to fix it.

49:57.255 --> 49:58.082
So I tried everything.

50:02.477 --> 50:03.652
The prodigal son.

50:05.959 --> 50:08.440
Now, prodigal doesn't
mean wild and crazy.

50:10.529 --> 50:12.313
It means wasteful.

50:12.487 --> 50:15.012
- [Congregation] That's
right. That's right.

50:15.186 --> 50:18.450
- But that was me, I was,
I was on this far-off land

50:20.060 --> 50:23.411
just wasting every good
thing that God gave me.

50:25.805 --> 50:28.590
I just need to remember that I
got a real dad that loves me.

50:29.765 --> 50:30.549
- Yes.
- Amen.

50:32.986 --> 50:33.769
- But I'm,

50:35.336 --> 50:36.598
I'm blessed because

50:38.992 --> 50:40.820
I have a Heavenly Father
that loves me even more.

50:40.994 --> 50:44.345
- Amen.
[congregation applauding]

50:46.434 --> 50:50.047
- That, that is still
hard for me to comprehend.

50:50.221 --> 50:54.225
- Preach it. Preach it.
[congregation applauding]

50:56.227 --> 50:59.839
- Don't waste the love
that God has given you.

51:01.797 --> 51:02.711
Since he forgave me,

51:04.583 --> 51:07.673
I'm positive that
he can forgive you.

51:07.847 --> 51:11.155
[congregation applauding]

51:13.113 --> 51:17.596
Just surrender to his love.

I wanna thank you

53:16.715 --> 53:19.239
for your willingness to
relocate from Shreveport.

53:20.719 --> 53:22.373
But I have made a decision.

53:23.678 --> 53:27.639
Samuel will be the new
pastor of this church.

53:27.813 --> 53:29.206
- Dad, come on.

53:29.380 --> 53:30.990
- Now, I know he's
a little young.

should not be a recent convert.

"Let no man despise thy youth."

53:45.918 --> 53:47.093

Always has, always will.

you've been hurt.

1:26:40.456 --> 1:26:43.633

sucked under that current.

1:26:50.117 --> 1:26:51.510
I'm holding onto you.

1:26:53.512 --> 1:26:54.252

I also took a, took a side

1:27:19.146 --> 1:27:21.932

things to someone else.

there is always hope.

been very nice to meet you.

1:38:16.281 --> 1:38:18.980
I'm sold. You have
an incredible family.

- W- w- what do,
what do you mean?

1:38:29.207 --> 1:38:30.817
- When the pastor
of this church left,

1:38:30.992 --> 1:38:34.038
it was legally turned over
to our advisory board,

1:38:34.212 --> 1:38:35.822

1:38:35.997 --> 1:38:38.651
who wished to remain unnamed,

1:38:38.825 --> 1:38:40.610
paid the mortgage
off on this place

1:38:40.784 --> 1:38:45.354

must become our new pastor.

Um, I mean yes. Yes, of course.

1:39:12.859 --> 1:39:14.035
more than anything in the world.

1:39:15.819 --> 1:39:18.909
- You just preached a
wonderful sermon on dreams.

1:39:19.083 --> 1:39:20.302
I don't think you should
be surprised by this,
