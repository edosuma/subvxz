WEBVTT

00:05.338 --> 00:08.306
Camp Kikiwaka is proud to
debut our new climbing wall.

00:08.342 --> 00:10.267
We thought this would be fun

00:10.302 --> 00:13.422
since so many of you try to climb the
razor wire fence surrounding the camp.

00:16.499 --> 00:19.667
Jorge, did the Bunny cabin
TP you again?

00:19.703 --> 00:20.902
(SIGHS) I'll tell them
to leave you alone,

00:20.938 --> 00:24.323
right after their nap time.

00:24.358 --> 00:27.826
No, I dress like this when my
favorite graphic novel comes out.

00:27.861 --> 00:29.853
I am King Tut Jones.

00:29.888 --> 00:32.230
Mummy detective!

00:32.265 --> 00:34.082
Ooh, maybe I can read it
when you're done.

00:34.118 --> 00:35.759
I'm a comic book nerd, too.

00:35.794 --> 00:37.853
I am not a comic book nerd.

00:37.888 --> 00:40.422
I'm a graphic novel nerd.

00:40.458 --> 00:43.459
And none of us will be
reading the new edition,

00:43.461 --> 00:46.194
because Gladys won't
let me go to town to buy one.

00:46.230 --> 00:48.488
Yeah, it's a rule. No campers
are allowed in town.

00:48.523 --> 00:50.932
Even counselors can't go.

00:50.967 --> 00:53.047
Which is ridiculous, because
I'm a responsible adult.

00:53.345 --> 00:54.661
(GIGGLES)

00:54.696 --> 00:57.739
Oh, flat tire! (CHUCKLES)

00:57.774 --> 00:59.214
Yeah. It's crazy
I can't go to town.

01:01.011 --> 01:02.469
Jorge, you can't get
your comic book...

01:02.504 --> 01:05.864
Graphic novel.

01:05.900 --> 01:08.283
But maybe you'd enjoy
trying the climbing wall.

01:08.319 --> 01:11.019
I read about danger,
I don't do danger.

01:13.098 --> 01:14.856
Okay, Tiffany, you're up first.

01:16.861 --> 01:19.744
I'm scared.

01:19.780 --> 01:20.946
Don't be. You can't fall, because
Emma's holding your safety rope.

01:22.366 --> 01:23.606
Emma! Right.

01:29.940 --> 01:32.124
"I know who I am
and I am enough."

01:34.152 --> 01:36.870
You're doing great, Tiff!

01:36.905 --> 01:38.745
Ahh! There's a spider on my leg!

01:38.774 --> 01:39.998
(TIFFANY SCREAMS)

01:40.033 --> 01:41.049
(GROANS)

01:42.344 --> 01:45.128
Ravi! You saved my life!

01:45.163 --> 01:47.472
How can I ever repay you?

01:47.507 --> 01:49.891
You can start by getting
your knee out of my coccyx.

01:51.227 --> 01:53.445
Tiffany, I'm so sorry.

01:53.522 --> 01:55.964
But in my defense, that
spider was really hairy,

01:55.999 --> 01:58.291
and I the can't stand
having hair on my legs.

01:58.326 --> 02:00.101
I like it.

02:00.137 --> 02:01.737
It tells me which way
the wind's blowing.

02:02.397 --> 02:03.572
Mmm, southwest.

02:06.677 --> 02:08.426
<i>¶ Here we go</i>

02:08.462 --> 02:11.396
<i>¶ We're leaving the city
behind right now</i>

02:11.431 --> 02:13.365
<i>¶ Let's gather by
the campfire light</i>

02:13.400 --> 02:15.225
<i>¶ And sing this song</i>

02:15.260 --> 02:16.751
ALL: <i>¶ Kikiwaka</i>

02:18.430 --> 02:21.006
<i>¶ Hanging out with someone new</i>

02:21.041 --> 02:23.691

of a camp canoe</i>

02:23.727 --> 02:25.652
<i>¶ What's that smell?
It's on your shoe</i>

02:25.687 --> 02:28.488
ALL: <i>¶ Kikiwaka</i>

02:28.524 --> 02:30.949
<i>¶ Got a s'more in my hair</i>

02:30.985 --> 02:33.226
<i>¶ Mosquitos in our underwear</i>

02:33.261 --> 02:35.162

02:35.197 --> 02:38.265
ALL: <i>¶ Kikiwaka</i>

02:38.300 --> 02:42.560

away from home away from home</i>

02:42.596 --> 02:46.331

A bear just ate my phone</i>

02:46.366 --> 02:48.875

02:48.910 --> 02:50.994

03:01.582 --> 03:02.631
(ZURI SNIFFLES)

03:06.295 --> 03:07.455
(BLOWING NOSE)

03:08.689 --> 03:10.013
Zuri, what's wrong?

03:11.558 --> 03:13.984
I lost my headphones.

03:14.019 --> 03:15.994
So, not only can
I not listen to music,

03:16.029 --> 03:19.522
but I can't pretend to listen to
music to get out of conversations

03:19.558 --> 03:21.758
with kids wearing toilet paper.

03:22.861 --> 03:25.821
I'd use gauze,
but the infirmary is out.

03:25.856 --> 03:28.698
Just my luck,

03:28.733 --> 03:31.173
some kid falls into a ravine the
day I need a mummy costume.

03:31.962 --> 03:34.621
Why are you wearing a costume?

03:34.656 --> 03:37.849
Because I wanted to go to the town's
store to buy a graphic novel.

03:37.885 --> 03:40.911
Wait, there's a town store?

03:40.946 --> 03:42.937
I could buy
new headphones there!

03:42.973 --> 03:44.873
Too bad it's against
the rules to go.

03:44.908 --> 03:46.466
Rules!

03:46.501 --> 03:47.501
You're so cute.

03:52.457 --> 03:53.457
(GROANS)

03:55.769 --> 03:57.928
Hey, Ravi. I got you
a little something

03:57.963 --> 04:00.288
to thank you for saving my life,

04:00.324 --> 04:02.044
and to apologize
for bruising your butt.

04:02.851 --> 04:05.035
Oh, thank you, Tiffany.

04:05.070 --> 04:07.454
But I cannot accept something...

04:07.489 --> 04:08.822
(GASPS) Ooh, a cushion!

04:11.943 --> 04:14.628
Oh!

04:14.705 --> 04:18.848
It's not just a cushion,
it's a promise cushion.

04:18.884 --> 04:21.176
I am sorry, I do not follow.

04:21.253 --> 04:24.696
By accepting, you are
promising your heart to me

04:24.731 --> 04:27.148
if and when my mother
ever allows me to date.

04:27.184 --> 04:30.359
Oh, that is very flattering.

04:30.395 --> 04:32.854
But, I am a CIT
and you are a camper.

04:32.889 --> 04:34.689
This little attraction,
while adorable,

04:34.724 --> 04:36.015
and a sign of very good taste,

04:36.051 --> 04:37.400
needs to come to an end.

04:37.436 --> 04:38.918
Oh, it will.

04:38.953 --> 04:40.720
Probably after our wedding.

04:40.755 --> 04:41.915
Definitely after our kids.

04:44.251 --> 04:46.184
Wait... Hey, Lou.

04:46.219 --> 04:48.361
I need your help.

04:48.396 --> 04:51.147
There is a girl who has
succumbed to my charms.

04:51.183 --> 04:52.707
There has to be a way
to spare her feelings

04:52.742 --> 04:54.342
and let her down easy,

04:54.378 --> 04:56.202
since I cannot turn off
all of this.

04:58.298 --> 04:59.331
All right, Casanova,

04:59.366 --> 05:02.600
just make this girl think
you're dating someone else.

05:02.636 --> 05:03.985
Then she'll know you
can't be together,

05:04.020 --> 05:05.504
but won't feel like
you rejected her.

05:05.539 --> 05:08.890
Oh, did you use that on some
poor sap who had a crush on you?

05:08.925 --> 05:11.392
No, I was the poor sap.

05:11.428 --> 05:12.710
Oh, oh, ooh!

05:12.746 --> 05:18.099
Well, my pretend girlfriend
will be named Symphonique.

05:18.134 --> 05:19.618
Let me know how that
works out for you.

05:19.653 --> 05:20.653
(CHUCKLES)

05:24.733 --> 05:28.076
Now, if we're going to sneak
out of camp unnoticed,

05:28.111 --> 05:29.402
we need to be stealthy.

05:35.594 --> 05:38.834
Jorge, sneaking is less effective when
you leave a trail of toilet paper.

05:40.157 --> 05:42.473
Uh-oh, that's not good.

05:42.509 --> 05:44.589
I'm not wearing
anything underneath.

05:44.895 --> 05:45.895
Wrap me!

05:47.689 --> 05:49.089
It's Gladys! Hide!

05:50.233 --> 05:51.233
(SIGHS)

05:54.404 --> 05:56.754
Jorge, what the heck
are you doin'?

05:56.790 --> 06:00.041
Uh, he got TP-ed
by the Bunny cabin again.

06:00.076 --> 06:02.636
(GASPS) I can't believe
they did that.

06:02.671 --> 06:03.831
(CHUCKLES) It's hilarious!

06:09.811 --> 06:12.153
Emma, you've gotta stop beating
yourself up about dropping Tiffany.

06:12.189 --> 06:13.830
Every counselor makes mistakes.

06:13.865 --> 06:15.465
Just be vigilant from now on.

06:15.501 --> 06:17.421
Right, we always have
to be focused on the kids.

06:20.197 --> 06:21.413
Where are all the kids?

06:23.383 --> 06:24.383
BOTH: Hmm.

06:28.563 --> 06:29.962
Hey, Ravi.

06:29.998 --> 06:31.731
Are you enjoying your cushion?

06:31.767 --> 06:33.399
It's stuffed with microfibers

06:33.435 --> 06:36.411
and age-appropriate affection.

06:36.446 --> 06:38.754
Tiffany, there is something
I must tell you.

06:38.790 --> 06:40.615
Ooh, I want to know
everything about you.

06:40.650 --> 06:42.375
I have a girlfriend.

06:42.410 --> 06:44.961
Except that. Who is she?

06:44.996 --> 06:46.676
Symphonique. Symphonique?

06:48.733 --> 06:49.741
You mean, from Weasel cabin?

06:49.777 --> 06:51.551
Wait, what?

06:51.586 --> 06:52.627
That girl over there, right?

06:52.662 --> 06:54.712
(GRUNTING)

06:54.748 --> 06:57.490
Yup, that is my baby-boo.
(CHUCKLES)

06:59.361 --> 07:01.310
Oh, yeah? Prove it.

07:01.346 --> 07:02.545
Go hold her hand.

07:02.580 --> 07:05.097
(CHUCKLES) Well, okay.

07:05.133 --> 07:07.684
Since she is, in fact,
my girlfriend,

07:07.719 --> 07:10.319
there is no reason she would
not hold my hand. (CHUCKLES)

07:11.823 --> 07:12.805
(GRUNTS)

07:12.841 --> 07:14.649
Oh!

07:14.684 --> 07:16.418
Okay, bluff called.

07:16.453 --> 07:18.653
I knew it!
Why would you lie to me?

07:18.688 --> 07:20.938
I'm sorry.

07:20.974 --> 07:23.958
I was just looking for a gentle way
to put an end to your little crush.

07:23.993 --> 07:25.913
Well, thanks for ripping
my heart out gently.

07:27.839 --> 07:30.006
I hope you can forgive
my little white lie.

07:30.041 --> 07:31.833
Sure, if you can forgive
my little white lie.

07:31.868 --> 07:33.584
Which is?

07:33.620 --> 07:34.903
That girl's name is Barbara.

07:34.938 --> 07:38.223
Wha... (GASPS)

07:38.258 --> 07:40.138
Well played, Tiffany.
Well played.

07:43.797 --> 07:45.688
Well, Jorge's definitely not
in the mess hall,

07:45.723 --> 07:49.091
because there's
still butter left.

07:49.127 --> 07:50.760
And I haven't seen Zuri since
she was complaining about

07:50.795 --> 07:53.621
needing new headphones.

07:53.656 --> 07:55.999
And Jorge was upset about not being
able to buy that new comic book.

07:56.034 --> 07:59.452
Oh, no! You know
what this means?

07:59.487 --> 08:02.280
Jorge and Zuri snuck into...
BOTH: Town!

08:02.316 --> 08:04.796
I am so in tune with the campers.
(CHUCKLES)

08:05.652 --> 08:07.351
But why would they do that?

08:07.387 --> 08:08.887
To get a comic book and head...

08:08.922 --> 08:10.822
BOTH: Phones!

08:10.857 --> 08:13.337
Mmm, yep, my theory
makes perfect sense!

08:13.627 --> 08:14.627
How do you do it?

08:16.320 --> 08:17.478
We have to find them!

08:17.513 --> 08:19.130
Okay.

08:19.165 --> 08:21.307
But we have to sneak out of
camp without anyone noticing,

08:21.342 --> 08:22.617
so be very inconspicuous.

08:26.573 --> 08:27.573
(SCOFFS) Boys.

08:34.872 --> 08:37.340
Ooh, jam session!
Let me break out my jug!

08:39.111 --> 08:42.704
(BLOWING INTO JUG)

08:42.739 --> 08:45.948
Uh, Lou, I'm dealing with
some real issues over here!

08:45.984 --> 08:48.409
(SCOFFS) It's not about
your mom again, is it?

08:48.445 --> 08:50.405
Because, if it is,
I've got to be...

08:50.789 --> 08:52.780
Somewhere.

08:52.815 --> 08:54.991
No, it's about a boy.

08:55.026 --> 08:58.494
Oh! Well, in that case,
I'm your girl!

08:58.529 --> 09:00.846
What's going on, kiddo?

09:00.882 --> 09:05.351
Well, I thought we had a real
connection, but he just blew me off.

09:05.386 --> 09:07.061
Oh, I've been there, honey.

09:07.097 --> 09:09.071
Have I been there.

09:09.107 --> 09:12.174
Mordecai Thompson.
Finest boy I've ever seen.

09:12.210 --> 09:14.370
We locked eyes over a tub of
beans at a family reunion.

09:14.403 --> 09:16.354
Family?

09:16.390 --> 09:18.270
He was a caterer!
I'm no hillbilly.

09:20.143 --> 09:22.185
The point is,
I wanted me some him,

09:22.220 --> 09:23.940
but he didn't want him any me.

09:24.981 --> 09:26.815
So, what did you do?

09:26.850 --> 09:29.259
I didn't fight for him,
so he got away.

09:29.294 --> 09:30.860
He ended up
with the leggy blonde

09:30.895 --> 09:32.495
who worked at the Worm Depot.

09:32.530 --> 09:35.565
(SOBS) It's so hard!

09:35.600 --> 09:38.159
Oh, no! I feel myself
going to a really dark place!

09:38.194 --> 09:40.786
Catch me, Tiffany! I'm falling!

09:40.822 --> 09:44.957
You're okay, Lou. And we were
talking about me, remember?

09:44.992 --> 09:47.001
Oh. Right, yeah, you.

09:47.037 --> 09:48.961
Um, listen.

09:48.996 --> 09:50.821
Learn from my mistakes.

09:50.857 --> 09:52.740
If you're sure this boy
is perfect for you,

09:52.776 --> 09:54.736
then you need to do whatever
it takes to show him.

09:55.520 --> 09:56.760
Whatever it takes.

09:59.273 --> 10:00.923
I'm going to do that.
Thanks, Lou.

10:05.113 --> 10:07.038
You gonna be okay?

10:07.074 --> 10:08.122
Who me? (CHUCKLES)

10:08.157 --> 10:09.891
Yeah, I'm good. Real good.

10:12.812 --> 10:15.563
(SOBS) Mordecai!
Catch me, stuffed cow!

10:21.463 --> 10:24.497
(GRUNTS)

10:24.532 --> 10:26.616
Jorge, we're here.
You can stop rolling.

10:29.896 --> 10:30.896
(GROANS)

10:34.600 --> 10:37.001
Excuse me... Uh-uh-uh-uh!

10:37.036 --> 10:40.454
The sign says,
"Ring bell for assistance."

10:40.490 --> 10:42.570
If you need assistance,
please ring the bell.

10:43.093 --> 10:45.810
(INAUDIBLE)

10:45.845 --> 10:47.019
Yeah, our bell is
currently out of order.

10:47.054 --> 10:49.263
How may I assist you?

10:49.299 --> 10:51.749
Where are your graphic novels?

10:51.784 --> 10:55.194
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
Slow down there, two-ply.

10:55.229 --> 10:56.671
I'm busy helping the young lady

10:56.706 --> 10:59.106
who was kind enough
to ring the bell.

11:02.162 --> 11:03.261
Do you have any headphones?

11:03.296 --> 11:05.237
Yeah, we do. Aisle three.

11:05.273 --> 11:07.593
It's the one marked "Aisle two."

11:12.330 --> 11:14.956
Hey, Zuri, would you mind
spotting me some cash?

11:14.991 --> 11:17.625
(SIGHS) You came all this
way without any money?

11:17.660 --> 11:21.170
Listen, not all of us
have rich parents.

11:21.205 --> 11:23.565
My mom's just a simple
anesthesiologist.

11:27.737 --> 11:30.738
ZURI: Here you go.

11:30.773 --> 11:33.399
Okay, let's go back to camp before
we get into serious trouble.

11:33.435 --> 11:35.643
(BELL DINGS)

11:35.678 --> 11:38.312
Jorge, Zuri, you are
in serious trouble!

11:40.300 --> 11:42.825
I hope you like
off-brand caviar,

11:42.861 --> 11:45.261
because that's all you two are
getting for the rest of the summer!

11:45.296 --> 11:47.136
You really need to work
on your punishments.

11:47.690 --> 11:48.740
Let's go now.

11:51.953 --> 11:52.953
(BELL DINGS)

11:55.214 --> 11:57.289
Uh, oops.

11:57.325 --> 11:59.659
That statue was one of a kind!

11:59.694 --> 12:03.262
Looks like you owe me 200 bucks!

12:03.297 --> 12:04.722
Tell me you're joking.

12:04.757 --> 12:06.507
Nope. Not a big fan of whimsy.

12:08.286 --> 12:11.312
Now, if you can't afford to pay,

12:11.348 --> 12:14.257
looks like you're gonna have to
stay here and work off your debt.

12:14.292 --> 12:16.167
But we have to get back to camp.

12:16.202 --> 12:17.644
And we don't have
that much cash.

12:17.679 --> 12:21.573
Well, the only other form of
payment I'll take is snow tires.

12:21.608 --> 12:23.191
Where am I supposed
to get snow tires?

12:23.226 --> 12:25.559
Any tire store.

12:25.595 --> 12:27.475
Or from the garage
of the guy who stole mine.

12:34.012 --> 12:35.469
Hey, Ravi.

12:35.505 --> 12:37.497
Oh, Tiffany, I am
so glad to see you.

12:37.532 --> 12:39.172
You are? Yeah.

12:40.410 --> 12:42.251
That cushion you got me,

12:42.287 --> 12:43.678
did you find it on a website?

12:43.713 --> 12:44.953
A catalog? (CHUCKLES)

12:45.807 --> 12:48.416
Forget the cushion.

12:48.451 --> 12:50.743
I thought about my crush on you,
and I realized you were right.

12:50.778 --> 12:53.463
In fact, a super cute boy

12:53.498 --> 12:55.665
my age just asked me
to hang out.

12:55.700 --> 12:58.526
Tiffany, I am
so very happy for you.

12:58.561 --> 13:00.053
Who is this lucky boy?

13:00.088 --> 13:02.454
(SIGHS) His name is Sven.

13:02.490 --> 13:04.865
He's the Norwegian kid
in Moose cabin.

13:04.900 --> 13:06.809
He's really sensitive.

13:06.844 --> 13:08.284
Both to feelings
and to sunlight.

13:09.847 --> 13:12.415
Wow, he sounds
like quite a catch.

13:12.450 --> 13:14.926
He is, but here's the thing,

13:14.961 --> 13:17.328
I'm kind of nervous.

13:17.363 --> 13:19.780
I've never hung out with
a boy I liked before.

13:19.815 --> 13:21.566
You will do fine.

13:21.601 --> 13:24.668
But I really want
Sven to like me.

13:24.704 --> 13:28.497
Hey, here's a spontaneous idea!

13:28.533 --> 13:31.134
What if you and I hung out,
you know, for practice?

13:31.169 --> 13:33.044
I don't know.

13:33.079 --> 13:34.839
I'll bring your cushion.
I am in.

13:38.927 --> 13:40.509
Okay, Tiffany, I am here to...

13:40.544 --> 13:43.454
Whoa!

13:43.490 --> 13:46.240
I thought we were just
"hanging out."

13:46.275 --> 13:48.517
This seems like a date

13:48.553 --> 13:50.553
based on what people
have told me about them.

13:51.314 --> 13:54.615
Absolutely not!

13:54.650 --> 13:58.436
I just figured that practicing
in a romantic environment now,

13:58.471 --> 14:00.788
will make it easier to play
checkers with Sven later.

14:00.823 --> 14:02.706
Oh, I get it!

14:02.742 --> 14:04.734
It is like working out.

14:04.769 --> 14:06.986
I lift the five pound weights,
so that later

14:07.021 --> 14:08.746
the one pound weights
feel lighter.

14:08.781 --> 14:10.339
You can lift five pounds?

14:12.327 --> 14:15.261
Well, with a spotter. (CHUCKLES)

14:15.296 --> 14:21.008
So, Sven, let's discuss our hopes and
dreams over a dozen raw oysters.

14:21.043 --> 14:23.144
Ooh, my cushion!

14:23.179 --> 14:24.270
Ah!

14:27.233 --> 14:30.217
People say you need a mature
palate to enjoy oysters.

14:30.252 --> 14:31.932
I might be only 11 but...

14:33.089 --> 14:34.089
(SLURPS)

14:35.784 --> 14:36.784
I love 'em.

14:38.677 --> 14:42.070
Guess that makes me mature.

14:42.106 --> 14:45.599
So, where do you see
yourself in 10 years?

14:45.635 --> 14:47.718
(MOCK NORWEGIAN ACCENT)
Well, since I am a Sven,

14:47.753 --> 14:51.447
and I am a Norwegian...

14:51.482 --> 14:55.234
I will probably be riding
a luge down a fjord.

14:55.269 --> 14:56.902
(CHUCKLES)

14:56.938 --> 14:59.547
Ravi, your accent is terrible.

14:59.582 --> 15:02.116
Maybe you should
just be yourself.

15:02.151 --> 15:04.432
Huh. My social skills coach
told me never to be myself.

15:07.356 --> 15:08.865
My hands are cramping.

15:08.900 --> 15:11.801
I can't change one
more expiration date!

15:11.836 --> 15:14.253
It beats scraping
mold off melons.

15:14.289 --> 15:16.781
These things are furry-er
than Gladys's back.

15:19.460 --> 15:22.528
Ted, this is wrong.

15:22.563 --> 15:24.555
That food belongs in a dumpster.

15:24.591 --> 15:26.151
Yeah, where do you
think I found it?

15:28.269 --> 15:30.728
You know what? That's it!

15:30.764 --> 15:32.988
This is Jorge's debt.
I'm out of here.

15:33.024 --> 15:34.606
Oh no, you're not!

15:34.642 --> 15:36.082
You might not have
broken the statue,

15:36.110 --> 15:38.761
but you snuck out of camp and
put us in this position.

15:38.797 --> 15:40.187
So we're all in this together.

15:40.222 --> 15:42.365
Sorry, can't hear you.

Hey, Ted, I need
a tire's worth of fruit.

16:01.318 --> 16:03.711
And scrape the mold off
better this time.

16:03.746 --> 16:05.946
Some of the campers
are getting "sick."

16:11.203 --> 16:14.222
So, how's your dad
doing after the divorce?

16:14.298 --> 16:16.974
I called to express
my sympathy and availability,

16:17.009 --> 16:19.693
(CHUCKLES) but he never
called me back.

16:19.729 --> 16:23.139
Yeah, uh, he wanted me
to tell you that he died.

16:26.093 --> 16:30.213
Ooh, will your cute uncle
be at your dad's funeral?

16:30.248 --> 16:32.648

going around. (CHUCKLES)

not telling Gladys we're here.

I didn't do it for you.

in the storeroom!

toilet paper would be the smart one.

Let's go.

17:15.835 --> 17:17.768

just going to play checkers.

played Norwegian checkers.

Wasn't I able to choke
down those sea boogers?

18:03.124 --> 18:06.325

and I belong together

allows me to date.

I'm doing "whatever it takes" to
show Ravi we belong together.

Absolutely not!

Did so!

back to my dark place.

you were a part of this!

about a kid her own age!

Never in a million years, would have
imagined she had a crush on you.

18:45.966 --> 18:47.825
Solely because
of the age difference.

18:49.353 --> 18:51.262
(SCOFFS) Tiffany,

18:51.297 --> 18:52.938
this is ridiculous.

to the other side of the road.

totally humiliated.

20:25.266 --> 20:27.399

want to talk to me?

20:27.435 --> 20:29.395
I thought I was just
a "ridiculous little girl."

20:31.297 --> 20:32.980
You know what?

20:33.015 --> 20:35.175
I should never have said that.

20:35.693 --> 20:38.168
I'm extremely sorry.

20:38.203 --> 20:40.562
Ravi, why don't you like me?

20:41.599 --> 20:43.474
I do like you.

20:43.509 --> 20:44.669
Very much, but...

20:45.670 --> 20:46.750
just as a friend.

20:48.096 --> 20:49.096
Tiffany,

20:50.658 --> 20:54.160
you are an amazing young woman.

20:54.195 --> 20:55.711
You are smart,

20:55.746 --> 20:58.839
and sweet, and pretty

20:58.875 --> 21:02.217
and I have never seen anyone
flip a flash card faster.

21:02.252 --> 21:03.252
It's all in the wrist.

21:04.296 --> 21:06.005
And if I were your age,

21:06.040 --> 21:09.216
there is no one I would rather
play Norwegian checkers with.

21:10.118 --> 21:11.652
Really?

21:11.687 --> 21:14.021
Absolutely.

And someday boys will be
lining up at your door,

21:18.077 --> 21:21.517
if and when your mom allows you to date.
(CHUCKLES)

21:21.597 --> 21:22.597
Thanks, Ravi.

21:26.861 --> 21:32.014
So, do you think we can
pretend this never happened

21:32.049 --> 21:33.014
and just go back
to being friends?

21:33.050 --> 21:36.143
I would love that.

21:36.178 --> 21:38.420
Oh, uh, see you at book club
in the mess hall tomorrow?

21:38.456 --> 21:40.430
Absolutely.

21:40.466 --> 21:43.658

I was talking to the cushion.

21:49.192 --> 21:50.392
Yeah, I got that.

21:57.984 --> 21:59.958
How did she beat us back?

21:59.993 --> 22:01.473
Ah, she probably
rode her broomstick.

22:02.655 --> 22:05.005
Bed check!

22:05.040 --> 22:07.165
Let's trip her by using
Zuri's headphones. Phones!

Sometimes great ideas
just come to me.

King Tut Jones has got this.

Ahh!

22:19.013 --> 22:19.961
Now's our chance.

22:19.997 --> 22:21.713
Ow!

22:21.749 --> 22:24.458
The one day I choose not to
wear my Senior-Alert bracelet!

22:28.038 --> 22:31.040
(SIGHS) Some kid lost
their headphones.

22:31.075 --> 22:32.633

snuck out of camp.

22:48.142 --> 22:49.916
Really sorry.

22:49.952 --> 22:51.576
And we'll never do it again.

22:51.612 --> 22:54.288
Never, ever.

22:54.323 --> 22:55.940
(SIGHS) Well, thank you
for saying that.

22:55.975 --> 22:57.975
We really appreciate it.

22:59.987 --> 23:02.020
Yeah, they're good kids.

23:02.055 --> 23:03.455
I'm glad they
learned their lesson.

23:06.677 --> 23:09.144
Come on, Timmy.
We're heading to town!

23:09.180 --> 23:11.380
I just hope you have money.

23:11.632 --> 23:12.840
Just kidding.

23:12.875 --> 23:18.186
