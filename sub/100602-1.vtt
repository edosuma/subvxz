05:07.541 --> 05:08.740
What can I get for you?

05:08.742 --> 05:12.544
-Can I just get a beer?
-[bartender] Sure. How's 805?

05:12.546 --> 05:15.314
-Great. Thank you.
-[bartender] No problem.

05:17.618 --> 05:19.918
That looks good. What's that?

05:23.057 --> 05:24.089
What?

05:24.091 --> 05:28.694
I was just wondering
what you chose, drink.

05:33.467 --> 05:34.900
Your voice sounds familiar.

05:36.437 --> 05:37.769
Do I know you?

05:39.573 --> 05:40.539
Wow.

05:41.742 --> 05:42.708
Okay.

05:47.848 --> 05:49.681
-Come here.
-[bartender] Yeah.

05:51.518 --> 05:53.085
I need a few minutes in private.

05:53.087 --> 05:54.686
-Do you mind?
-[bartender] Oh, sure.

05:54.688 --> 05:55.721
Thanks.

[upbeat music]

06:20.481 --> 06:22.013
Code name, Dragonfly.

06:25.719 --> 06:27.619
The reason why
you recognize my voice

06:27.621 --> 06:30.722
is because you hear it over
your earpiece while you work.

06:32.826 --> 06:34.092
What is this?

06:36.897 --> 06:40.565
We're never supposed to meet,
or even speak on
an unsecured line.

06:42.102 --> 06:45.937
I'm your cleaner, or guardian
angel, if you prefer.

06:47.908 --> 06:50.542
I arranged your medical
attention for that bullet wound.

06:53.180 --> 06:56.114
I was just going to prove to you
that I know where you got shot.

06:56.116 --> 07:00.752
Our employers won't
appreciate us meeting like this.
What do you want?

07:03.023 --> 07:05.957
-I want to know why--
-The drink is called
[speaking in foreign language].

07:08.962 --> 07:10.862
It's scotch, now you know.

07:11.765 --> 07:14.499
You should try it.
Great to meet you.

07:15.068 --> 07:16.701
I don't care about the drink.

07:17.871 --> 07:20.739
I want to know why you
chose to let that pilot live.

07:22.676 --> 07:24.643
Why you'd risk our
employers finding out?

07:25.779 --> 07:27.546
Could have ruined
the entire operation.

07:27.548 --> 07:29.181
[gentle music]

07:29.183 --> 07:31.950
It was a bad choice in my part.
It won't happen again.

07:33.921 --> 07:37.055
I won't report it. I promise.

07:38.659 --> 07:42.527
I actually came here to
hire you for something private.

07:44.631 --> 07:46.031
I don't like this game.

07:48.702 --> 07:50.168

What's your name?

20:09.375 --> 20:10.608
Elizabeth.

20:14.247 --> 20:16.981
You risked both of our lives
by contacting me, Elizabeth.

20:18.785 --> 20:19.917
I want to know why.

20:28.261 --> 20:31.829
[gentle synthesizer music]

20:44.711 --> 20:46.510
No signal can leave this area.

20:46.879 --> 20:49.413
I have scramblers.
Not even your tech will work.

21:04.264 --> 21:05.696
Do you recognize these faces?

21:09.769 --> 21:10.835
Some.

21:13.539 --> 21:15.640
We killed him
because he was going to expose

21:15.642 --> 21:19.377
our executives who attended
a work he was at, Lolita Island.

21:20.780 --> 21:22.480
I killed him, not you.

21:24.484 --> 21:25.616
I helped.

21:28.488 --> 21:30.855
[keyboard clacking]

21:32.025 --> 21:33.891
Do you remember
your trip to Yala?

21:37.930 --> 21:39.664
Not one of mine.

21:39.666 --> 21:41.432
I don't get
assigned to kill women.

21:41.434 --> 21:47.004
No, of course you don't.
Your psych evaluations
make that quite clear.

21:48.074 --> 21:52.076
But I bet you remember sneaking
into a second story hotel room

21:52.078 --> 21:54.945
and poisoning a seafood paella,
while someone was in the shower?

21:56.783 --> 21:59.984
It was hers,
a reporter who was there

21:59.986 --> 22:02.386
to expose businessmen
who go to Thailand

22:02.388 --> 22:05.923
to have sex with children,
some of whom are our members.

22:06.826 --> 22:07.958
She had to die.

22:10.530 --> 22:12.997
Is finding that out supposed
to make me have a breakdown?

22:13.933 --> 22:15.900
It's supposed to open your eyes.

22:16.569 --> 22:18.002
The world's a messy place.

22:18.604 --> 22:21.739
I learned a long time ago,
there are no more heroes left.

22:25.044 --> 22:28.346
[keyboard clacking]

22:28.348 --> 22:29.680
See this man?

22:32.819 --> 22:33.951
I don't remember him.

22:33.953 --> 22:38.522
I guess that's
because I can kill men
with a clear conscience.

22:38.991 --> 22:41.025
There's something you
can add to my psych report.

22:42.628 --> 22:46.464
You didn't kill him,
just persuaded him.

22:47.667 --> 22:50.468
They send me to kill men,
not persuade them.

22:51.504 --> 22:54.405
Oh, but you did, the car bomb.

22:55.441 --> 22:56.574
That didn't kill him?

22:56.576 --> 22:59.910
It killed his
four-year-old son and a nanny.

23:00.880 --> 23:03.481
That persuaded him to
rescind his company's bid

23:03.483 --> 23:05.783
on an offer that one
of our members wanted.

23:06.919 --> 23:09.086
In exchange, we let his
seven-year-old daughter live.

23:10.790 --> 23:13.924
You should delete this
little collection of yours
before they find out.

23:15.094 --> 23:16.627
They never will.

23:17.463 --> 23:18.496
I should report this.

23:19.065 --> 23:20.464
But you won't.

23:20.466 --> 23:22.833
More psych exam extrapolations?

23:22.835 --> 23:24.101
Cut to the chase!

23:24.871 --> 23:27.405
Our employers
need people like you

23:27.940 --> 23:29.473
to eliminate their enemies,

23:30.543 --> 23:33.110
and people like me
to erase their tracks.

23:33.780 --> 23:35.112
I knew that before I came here.

23:35.114 --> 23:37.081
What I don't know
is what you want from me.

23:38.017 --> 23:39.183
You're not a sociopath.

23:41.020 --> 23:43.687
You can't live with yourself
doing these kinds of things,

23:43.689 --> 23:45.623
any more than I can,
not long-term.

23:45.625 --> 23:48.793
We can either be
patriots and live,
or be killed off, period.

23:50.930 --> 23:51.962
Patriots.

23:53.533 --> 23:55.766
Oh, you still believe
we work for the government.

23:56.702 --> 23:57.868
That changes things.

24:02.809 --> 24:06.577
I clean for others, you know?
Not just you.

24:08.014 --> 24:11.148
One of them is
a human trafficker
who works for our people.

24:11.150 --> 24:13.217
She scavenges at orphanages,

24:14.120 --> 24:16.821
because no one
looks for missing orphans.

24:16.823 --> 24:18.722
Hmm. Clever.

24:19.959 --> 24:21.725
Disgusting, but clever.

24:21.727 --> 24:23.661
Amongst their many sins,

24:23.663 --> 24:27.164
our employers have an
insatiable lust for young flesh.

24:28.468 --> 24:33.137
That's nothing new.
But then I discovered
something worse.

24:36.742 --> 24:40.978
It's taken a lot of
investigation, but I can
prove, without a doubt,

24:40.980 --> 24:45.916
that our employers are
sending girls to be
sacrificed...

24:47.253 --> 24:49.753
by some sort of serial killer.

24:51.157 --> 24:52.690
Our employers have gone

24:52.692 --> 24:58.529
from power-hungry
tyrants to just... evil.

24:58.531 --> 24:59.497
Why?

24:59.499 --> 25:04.168
I wish I knew, but
this is secret society stuff.

25:05.271 --> 25:07.638
They've taken
a psychotic killer in chains

25:07.640 --> 25:10.741
to the wilderness
and unleashed him.

25:11.811 --> 25:14.044
Now, they're sending
girls to be butchered by him,

25:14.046 --> 25:16.714
and our employers are doing it.

25:17.216 --> 25:19.783
-I can show you,
I'll prove, just look.
-[laptop thudding]

25:20.920 --> 25:23.020
Why don't you just
tell me what you want from me?

25:26.259 --> 25:28.692
Innocent, young women
are dying...

25:29.862 --> 25:31.262
and it's my fault.

25:33.065 --> 25:36.567
Simply put, I want you
to eliminate the problem.

25:36.569 --> 25:37.935
Our employers?

25:37.937 --> 25:39.303
No, the killer.

25:39.305 --> 25:41.105
I'll, I'll settle for just him.

25:44.210 --> 25:46.577
I realize you're
sensitive to all this.

25:47.313 --> 25:49.813
In our business, that's bad.

25:51.083 --> 25:54.051
If cleaning is too much for you,
then asked to be reassigned.

25:54.554 --> 25:56.186
You can do that
without getting us killed.

25:56.822 --> 25:59.590
I thought you might say that.

26:00.960 --> 26:02.826
If I can't appeal
to your sense of honor,

26:02.828 --> 26:05.195
maybe I can appeal to
your sense of self-preservation.

26:06.999 --> 26:09.033
I know you've been
saving up for retirement.

26:09.035 --> 26:11.168
I have money.
I don't need yours.

26:12.204 --> 26:13.971
You don't have nearly enough.

26:15.074 --> 26:17.841
They'll never let you,
[laughing] walk out the door

26:17.843 --> 26:20.110
and put in your papers
when you want to retire.

26:20.880 --> 26:23.314
They won't let you go sit
on some beach and sip margaritas

26:23.316 --> 26:25.082
to assuage your conscience.

26:26.185 --> 26:27.318
You know too much.

26:29.221 --> 26:33.157
People like us
don't retire, we vanish.

26:35.127 --> 26:40.297
And the only question
is whether we make
ourselves vanish, or they do.

26:40.866 --> 26:43.634
I know that,
and I have my own plan.

26:44.870 --> 26:46.303
And I'll bet it's good.

26:47.106 --> 26:48.806
But I have
half a million in cash.

26:50.142 --> 26:52.009
I know it's not
enough to get out in style,

26:52.011 --> 26:56.680
but it's a good down
payment on a simple kill,

26:57.750 --> 27:00.250
and this time, a righteous kill.

27:00.252 --> 27:02.119
[gentle synthesizer music]

27:11.130 --> 27:13.831
[woman] I descend
directly from the Duponts.

27:14.400 --> 27:15.966
What a legacy.

27:17.036 --> 27:18.636
And a responsibility,

27:19.038 --> 27:21.905
one that generations
my family have had to bear.

27:24.210 --> 27:26.310
This conversation's
not for your ears.

27:29.815 --> 27:34.852
Getting the cattle away
from the church took decades,
but it worked.

27:35.254 --> 27:37.955
Now they lack
faith and fellowship,

27:38.658 --> 27:40.190
and they're
all the weaker for it.

27:41.661 --> 27:45.696
It was my father's initiative.
God rest his soul.

27:45.698 --> 27:50.401
Allow me to interject, ladies,
but in polite company,
we should refer to them

27:50.403 --> 27:56.073
as the working class,
or the masses, and not cattle.

27:56.075 --> 28:00.244
Oh, Howard,
there's no need to show off
in front of your girlfriend.

28:00.246 --> 28:05.249
I'm not. I've already
explained that our job
is to help guide the masses.

28:05.918 --> 28:08.385
By keeping them in their place

28:08.387 --> 28:10.254
so they can
live relatively happy

28:10.256 --> 28:14.725
toiling away to support us,
while we shape the world in ways

28:14.727 --> 28:17.394
that are necessary
to advance civilization.

28:18.364 --> 28:22.966
Ways they might find
distasteful in their ignorance,

28:23.736 --> 28:26.036
but it is a burden we must bear.

28:26.472 --> 28:28.872
Thea, what are your thoughts?

28:28.874 --> 28:34.144
In all honesty, I do understand
that in order for
the world to progress,

28:34.146 --> 28:35.979
we need to control the masses.

28:36.982 --> 28:38.782
It's in their best interest.

28:39.919 --> 28:42.853
-It's in all of
our best interests.
-It really is.

28:42.855 --> 28:45.856
For instance,
Kathleen here works in media.

28:46.959 --> 28:50.227
She helps by shortening the
attention span of the cattle,

28:50.229 --> 28:53.897
and creates content that makes
them go against their nature

28:53.899 --> 28:57.501
so they stay just smart enough
to work and generate comrades.

28:58.237 --> 29:01.071
But not smart enough to
know who's pulling the strings.

29:01.073 --> 29:05.342
Here, here.
The media, our greatest asset.

29:05.344 --> 29:07.778
[jaunty orchestral music]

29:09.849 --> 29:12.750
Well, I'm deep in
the trenches in LA,

29:12.752 --> 29:16.754
movie stars,
executives, the homeless.

29:17.289 --> 29:20.924
I can't decide which
are the most disgusting.

29:21.494 --> 29:25.529
But I put a smile on my face
and I try to understand.

29:25.531 --> 29:28.332
[scoffing] They just
don't know any better.

29:28.334 --> 29:30.501
That's why our initiative
is so crucial.

29:30.503 --> 29:34.872
We must redouble our focus to
road the most elemental bond,

29:34.874 --> 29:37.040
the bond that even
the cattle can feel.

29:39.011 --> 29:41.879
Oh, excuse me,
Doctor, the masses.

29:44.049 --> 29:45.816
What's the initiative?

29:47.286 --> 29:50.821
She doesn't understand.
How cute.

29:52.024 --> 29:56.827
The bond between a man
and a woman must be destroyed.

29:57.897 --> 30:00.364
See, that bond leads to love,

30:00.366 --> 30:03.433
love leads to children,
children leads to family,

30:04.136 --> 30:07.271
family leads to
living as nature intended,

30:08.107 --> 30:09.807
which breaks our control.

30:11.043 --> 30:13.911
There's no need
for family anymore. Right?

30:14.814 --> 30:18.482
And what we have in the micro,
you must establish in the macro.

30:20.019 --> 30:21.451
Fascinating.

30:21.453 --> 30:24.822
[cellphone buzzing]

30:26.292 --> 30:29.159
Give me the countersign
to Obelisk 58.

30:30.596 --> 30:32.229
Confirm, that's a go.

30:33.299 --> 30:34.464
Oh, that one.

30:36.235 --> 30:38.468
He can have that one,
she's of no use to me.

30:40.306 --> 30:42.005
Let him have his fun.

30:42.007 --> 30:44.508
I'll have him released.
Zhora out.

30:45.511 --> 30:47.311
[cellphone beeping]

30:48.113 --> 30:51.281
Just got the authorization.
Go ahead and let him loose.

30:52.084 --> 30:54.351
Keep a sniper on him
until I clear the area.

30:54.353 --> 30:58.288
He's a little too
fond of me. My life is
in your hands, Sergeant.

31:00.259 --> 31:01.325
[cellphone beeping]

31:03.329 --> 31:06.463
[gentle music]

31:20.346 --> 31:23.981
[Zhora] I was just metering
the light, and this looks
like the perfect location

31:23.983 --> 31:25.349
for our photo shoot.

31:26.952 --> 31:29.052
So much better than
the group home, right?

31:29.054 --> 31:30.520
[laughing]

31:30.522 --> 31:33.090
Oh, yeah. For sure.

31:34.293 --> 31:36.326
It's such a beautiful place.

31:37.196 --> 31:38.462
I could die happy here.

31:38.464 --> 31:42.399
All right,
I'm just going to go grab
the rest of my camera gear.

31:43.636 --> 31:45.035
Oh, I can help you.

31:46.205 --> 31:47.537
Oh, there's no need.

31:49.008 --> 31:50.641
Well, I can help
you carry your equipment.

31:51.343 --> 31:54.244
Oh, I know. It's just,
it's so warm out here,

31:54.246 --> 31:56.413
I don't want you
to exert yourself.

31:56.415 --> 31:58.649
Plus, there's
all these branches,
and we don't want to scratch up

31:58.651 --> 32:00.517
those perfect supermodel legs.

32:00.519 --> 32:04.087
[chuckling] Okay, well,
if you change your mind,

32:04.089 --> 32:05.489
just give me a holler.

32:06.692 --> 32:08.325
You're sweet.

32:08.327 --> 32:10.227
Feel free to cool off
in the river, okay?

32:10.229 --> 32:11.328
I'll be right back.

32:13.198 --> 32:16.166
[ominous music]

34:18.323 --> 34:21.258
[gentle music]

34:31.236 --> 34:32.569
[dramatic musical sting]

34:32.571 --> 34:34.237
[screaming]

-[woman screaming]

[blood splattering]

35:10.576 --> 35:11.842

35:13.779 --> 35:15.378
[ominous music]

35:21.320 --> 35:22.652
[glasses clinking]

35:26.692 --> 35:29.126
Media is the key
to our offensive.

35:29.561 --> 35:32.529
It's a clinical fact
that people imprint better

35:32.531 --> 35:34.731
when they're in
heightened emotional states.

35:34.733 --> 35:36.566
[jaunty orchestral music]

35:36.568 --> 35:41.538
Movies, TV, music,
all exploit emotions.

35:41.540 --> 35:43.473
Social media is a multiplayer.

35:43.909 --> 35:46.443
That puts operatives
like you on the frontline.

35:47.379 --> 35:53.183
I make sure all of
the content we produce
glamorizes sexual promiscuity,

35:53.185 --> 35:56.820
homosexuality,
abortion, drug use,

35:57.556 --> 36:01.858
transgenderism, whatever
the perversion<i> du jour</i> is.

36:02.694 --> 36:07.531
Once we convince them
to chop their dicks off,
we've owned them in every way.

36:07.533 --> 36:10.200
It's important to
make them go against nature.

36:11.436 --> 36:13.436
Emasculate the males.

36:13.438 --> 36:17.340
Convince them that their
natural impulses are toxic.

36:17.342 --> 36:19.809
Convince the females
that virtue and self-respect

36:19.811 --> 36:23.180
are antiquated notions
from their grandmother's era.

36:24.917 --> 36:28.251
We teach the females
to act like males,

36:28.253 --> 36:30.554
drink like a man,
screw like a man,

36:30.556 --> 36:33.456
so they lose all sense of
what it means to be a woman.

36:34.860 --> 36:37.894
Depicting divorce as
independence and freedom is key.

36:37.896 --> 36:41.431
Divorce numbers
have been going down,
but we need them to go up.

36:42.334 --> 36:46.436
We can enslave
the males financially,
and lower the mental health

36:46.438 --> 36:48.205
of the females
and their offspring.

36:48.207 --> 36:53.343
Yes, we've been strong in
that initiative for many years,
and we'll continue on it.

36:54.713 --> 36:58.682
-I think it's time that
we normalize pedophilia.
-I agree.

36:58.684 --> 37:01.418
But our research
indicates another decade

37:01.420 --> 37:03.587
before we can put
that initiative into motion.

37:04.523 --> 37:07.457
I think we could
do it in five years.

37:08.894 --> 37:10.760
Until then,
we could use our currently

37:10.762 --> 37:13.630
normalized perversions
to road the nuclear family.

37:13.999 --> 37:16.533
Society will be
a much better place

37:16.535 --> 37:21.238
when we dictate
what a family is.

37:21.240 --> 37:26.576
So if I understand it,
no love, no happy homes,

37:26.578 --> 37:29.546
which equals no next generation

37:29.548 --> 37:33.817
-of well-adjusted champions
looking to dethrone us.
-Precisely, my dear.

37:37.256 --> 37:40.657
Didn't I tell you? She's not
just another pretty face.

37:40.959 --> 37:45.028
She's going to take us to the
next level and preserve our
most sacred order.

37:49.434 --> 37:50.567
Agreed.

37:51.336 --> 37:52.736
She's a fine addition.

37:53.405 --> 37:55.705
Thea, why don't you
give us a moment

37:55.707 --> 37:58.808
-to speak in private, my dear.
-[chuckling] Certainly.

38:07.853 --> 38:09.386
Come here, my sweet.

38:12.024 --> 38:15.358
[ominous music]

38:15.360 --> 38:18.662
Kathleen, look at this.

38:19.698 --> 38:21.531
Look at her glowing skin.

38:26.705 --> 38:29.806
The luster of
her hair. [chuckling]

38:30.709 --> 38:33.410
Oh, say nothing of this.

38:34.680 --> 38:36.646
Hey, stand still, you.

38:37.983 --> 38:41.518
We're just admiring how lucky
you are to be in your prime.

38:43.322 --> 38:44.954
[chuckling]

38:51.930 --> 38:53.897
Look at the bounce on that.

38:56.368 --> 38:59.969
Kathleen, we need your vote,
and we're willing
to compensate you for it

39:00.572 --> 39:02.372
with the fountain of youth.

39:02.374 --> 39:05.942
As you know, Dr. Bieger
can do a full blood transfusion.

39:06.712 --> 39:10.347
How would you like the blood
of a beautiful
young woman like that

39:12.517 --> 39:14.217
coursing through your veins?

39:14.218 --> 39:15.918
Our last exam
show the beginnings
of possible liver disease.

39:16.655 --> 39:19.456
How would you like to have
a brand new liver installed?

39:19.858 --> 39:22.559
A liver from a young,
vibrant person.

39:23.495 --> 39:25.628
You mean the organs of a child?

39:25.630 --> 39:28.398
We will give you
spinal fluid from babies,

39:28.400 --> 39:32.702
but the organs of
children are too small
and have no capacity.

39:32.704 --> 39:35.605
The organs of a young adult
have just finished forming

39:35.607 --> 39:37.974
and work at maximum efficiency.

39:38.543 --> 39:40.977
A young, flowering woman,

39:40.979 --> 39:43.146
so you can
radiate in that way again.

39:45.951 --> 39:47.617
I mean, you've
made great achievements

39:47.619 --> 39:49.419
pushing our agenda
through the media.

39:50.589 --> 39:53.156
And you've suffered a lot
of stress and sleepless nights

39:53.158 --> 39:55.125
healing those
filthy celebrities.

39:56.161 --> 39:57.794
You deserve this.

39:57.796 --> 40:03.066
We can facilitate it all
in exchange for a vote
of confidence from you.

40:03.902 --> 40:06.035
The gathering of the elders
is next month.

40:06.638 --> 40:07.904
Do I have your support?

40:16.848 --> 40:19.649
[ominous music]

40:25.123 --> 40:26.556
How can I say no?

40:28.460 --> 40:31.161
[upbeat synthesizer music]

40:48.980 --> 40:50.213
It's fine.

40:53.685 --> 40:54.818
Can you put it there?

41:04.663 --> 41:06.729
Half a million, cash.

41:15.740 --> 41:18.241
Add that to what
you've already saved,

41:19.144 --> 41:23.179
and live a long, modest life
in a remote paradise
of your choice.

41:29.020 --> 41:31.054
How do you know
how much I've saved?

41:33.191 --> 41:34.858
I know all about you.

41:37.162 --> 41:40.196
Our employers instructed me
to keep you under surveillance

41:40.832 --> 41:43.199
in addition to
just cleaning after you.

41:44.970 --> 41:46.836
I'm like
a well-equipped stalker.

41:46.838 --> 41:49.072
I've spent
so many hours watching you.

41:50.575 --> 41:52.141
I know you're
desperate to get out...

41:53.512 --> 41:55.111
and would if you had the money.

41:56.948 --> 42:00.517
I haven't shared that
observation with our employer.

42:03.121 --> 42:06.689
How do you know I won't just
kill you and take this money?

42:07.526 --> 42:10.627
Like I said,
I know all about you.

42:13.265 --> 42:14.864
Especially your secret.

42:16.234 --> 42:17.267
What secret?

42:18.937 --> 42:20.236
You're one of the good guys.

42:40.592 --> 42:42.959
Amongst all us villains,

42:44.129 --> 42:46.729
even though
they've tried to take it
out of you, they haven't.

42:49.701 --> 42:52.802
And even though
we've just met, I know I can
trust you with my life.

42:54.806 --> 42:57.907
If I'm wrong,
kill me and take the money.

42:59.177 --> 43:00.677
Choice is yours.

43:02.647 --> 43:03.746
Choice?

43:07.886 --> 43:09.886
When I was young,
I made the bad choice

43:09.888 --> 43:13.056
to trade my career in the army
for this black ops work.

43:14.926 --> 43:19.629
Then I made an even worse choice
for not leaving
before I got too deep.

43:21.066 --> 43:23.933
Now that I've finally
learned from my mistakes,

43:24.936 --> 43:27.637
you want me to make
yet another bad choice?

43:33.678 --> 43:37.347
You don't strike me
as the kind of man
who laments his decisions.

43:44.923 --> 43:45.989
In that case...

-And this is so much better
than the group home, right?
-That's for sure.

46:05.830 --> 46:09.766
At first, it was kind of strange
coming all the way
out here by ourselves.

46:10.502 --> 46:13.035
[Zhora] Yeah, but it's totally
worth it for the privacy.

46:14.539 --> 46:16.873
-Can I see them?
-[Zhora] Oh, yeah.

46:17.776 --> 46:20.076

you're out of harm's way?

51:19.610 --> 51:21.744
You are. What's wrong?

51:22.313 --> 51:24.413
[Dragonfly] There's an active
and well-kept power station

51:24.415 --> 51:26.115
that seems to be
going underground.

51:26.717 --> 51:28.684
Knowing that our employers
are involved,

51:29.554 --> 51:31.720
we might be into more
than what we bargained for.

-I'm engaging multiple

-What?

54:47.885 --> 54:50.052
[Dragonfly] This is more than
some psycho and a murder spree.

54:50.054 --> 54:53.022
Abort now!
I'll find my own way out.

55:05.770 --> 55:07.603
I've been reading intel reports

55:07.605 --> 55:09.938
that China, India, and Africa

55:09.940 --> 55:14.610
are the leading providers of
harvested body parts?

55:14.612 --> 55:18.947
Well, we don't
deal in substandard parts
with subhuman people.

55:18.949 --> 55:21.083
That might be okay for
the wealthy among the masses,

55:21.085 --> 55:23.419
but we don't settle
for second best here.

55:23.854 --> 55:27.690
Besides, preserved blood
is no longer energized.

55:27.692 --> 55:31.093
You're going to receive
fresh, living blood and organs,

55:31.095 --> 55:34.830
from fine physical specimens
from the proper lineage.

55:34.832 --> 55:36.532
The masses might
be brain dead sheep,

55:36.534 --> 55:38.834
but their bodies are
perfect for harvesting.

55:40.705 --> 55:42.705
Could I see the girl being used?

Who does your
decorating, Doctor?

56:02.760 --> 56:04.960
[Howard] I'll
have these removed.
They're not important.

56:04.962 --> 56:07.596
[Kathleen] Question is,
why are they here
in the first place?

56:07.598 --> 56:10.833
This might sound strange,
but we use a serial killer

56:10.835 --> 56:12.968
as a friend,
to protect the facility.

56:14.004 --> 56:15.471
You mean as a scapegoat.

56:15.473 --> 56:17.373
Exactly, yes.

56:17.375 --> 56:18.941
If law enforcement ever trace

56:18.943 --> 56:20.509
any of the missing
girls to this area,

56:20.511 --> 56:22.144
they'll find
an ax-wielding maniac,

56:22.146 --> 56:24.947
and he'll take the fall
while we fade into the ether.

56:27.451 --> 56:30.386
-Is that her?
-She just came in.

56:32.022 --> 56:34.022
[gentle music]

56:34.024 --> 56:35.858
[Kathleen] She's perfect.

56:36.560 --> 56:38.527
[Howard] And she's all yours.

56:41.665 --> 56:42.765
So...

56:44.935 --> 56:46.135
would I be lying here?

56:47.538 --> 56:49.071
[Howard] Exactly.

56:49.073 --> 56:53.041
It's just like taking a nap,
except when you wake up,

56:53.043 --> 56:55.577
you'll feel more rejuvenated
than you ever have,

56:56.580 --> 56:58.547
just like when
the world was new.

56:59.717 --> 57:01.550

-What was that?

57:02.520 --> 57:04.153
Um, I don't know.

scheduled for today. Excuse me.

I'm sure.

-[door opening]
-Doctor, the compound
is under attack.

57:37.855 --> 57:40.055
We need to grab your go-kit
and evacuate. Come on.

57:40.658 --> 57:41.957
An opportune...

57:45.563 --> 57:47.629
but there will be others.

57:51.469 --> 57:52.501
Let's go.

-Tell me!

1:06:01.425 --> 1:06:04.025
I have something here
that will explain everything.

1:06:08.699 --> 1:06:10.165
There's no danger here.

1:06:19.176 --> 1:06:21.076
Two million dollars.

1:06:31.555 --> 1:06:34.589
And I know who you are,
codename Dragonfly.

1:06:41.765 --> 1:06:45.000
What you don't know...
is you've been working

1:06:45.002 --> 1:06:47.068
for me and my associates
for years.

1:06:47.070 --> 1:06:49.504
Take the money
and never look for us,

1:06:50.240 --> 1:06:51.773
and we'll never look for you.

[Elizabeth groaning]

1:07:35.352 --> 1:07:36.551
Leave it here.
I'll be right back.

1:07:37.621 --> 1:07:38.787
Make your choice now.

1:07:41.158 --> 1:07:43.525
Take it now or lose it forever!

1:07:43.527 --> 1:07:47.562
Filthy animal. Now, Howard,
get me out of this nightmare!

1:07:53.503 --> 1:07:57.305
Take the money and live
a long and happy life.

1:07:59.376 --> 1:08:02.243
Or be killed by
that blood-thirsty maniac!

1:08:05.148 --> 1:08:06.514
Your choice!

1:08:09.586 --> 1:08:11.419
You can still catch it!
