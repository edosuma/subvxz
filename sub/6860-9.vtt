Male announcer:
Pursued by pirates!

00:18.884 --> 00:20.284
While on a rite of passage,

00:20.318 --> 00:24.121
six Jedi younglings
and Ahsoka Tano are ambushed.

00:24.155 --> 00:25.755
Protecting the young Jedi,

00:25.790 --> 00:28.858
Ahsoka was captured by
the nefarious Hondo Ohnaka

00:28.926 --> 00:31.427
and taken to the planet Florrum.

00:31.461 --> 00:33.596
Marshalling their courage and training,

00:33.630 --> 00:36.264
the younglings infiltrated
the pirate stronghold

00:36.299 --> 00:38.567
and rescued Ahsoka.

00:38.601 --> 00:41.636
Now we find our heroes
in a race to their starship,

00:41.671 --> 00:43.405
with the pirates closing in.

00:43.439 --> 00:46.275

[moaning]

00:58.221 --> 00:59.622
I know.
I see them.

00:59.656 --> 01:00.656
They're gaining on us!

01:00.691 --> 01:03.193
[blasters firing]

[explosion]

01:06.798 --> 01:08.532
[explosion]

01:08.567 --> 01:11.769
Uh, I think they're still
upset that we tricked them.

01:16.142 --> 01:18.410
They'll get over it
once we're off their planet.

01:21.882 --> 01:23.416
I wouldn't be so sure about that.

01:23.450 --> 01:24.417
Right.

01:24.451 --> 01:26.953
Ganodi, we need a quick evac.

01:26.987 --> 01:28.054
Come in, please.

01:28.088 --> 01:29.422
Ganodi.

01:29.456 --> 01:31.223
Maybe the pirates
are jamming the signal.

01:31.258 --> 01:32.358
[moaning]

01:32.392 --> 01:33.893
Where could she be?

01:33.927 --> 01:35.895
Ganodi. Huyang.
Come in.

01:41.367 --> 01:43.234
Attaching your head took a lot longer

01:43.268 --> 01:44.535
than I thought it would.

01:44.602 --> 01:46.503
It is appreciated, youngling.

01:46.537 --> 01:49.039
Mobility is paramount,
especially in an emergency.

01:49.073 --> 01:51.474
Ganodi, where are you?

01:51.509 --> 01:52.475
I'm here.

01:52.509 --> 01:54.311
I was in the back fixing Huyang.

01:54.345 --> 01:55.478
Great.
That's great.

01:55.513 --> 01:56.813
But we're all gonna need repairs

01:56.881 --> 01:58.414
if you don't have the engines running.

01:58.449 --> 01:59.716
Where are you?

01:59.750 --> 02:01.084
Ganodi, it's Ahsoka.

02:01.118 --> 02:02.085
[gasps]

02:02.119 --> 02:03.086
Padawan Tano!

02:03.121 --> 02:04.387
We've rescued you.

02:04.421 --> 02:05.655
Almost.

02:05.689 --> 02:07.357
But we need you to get us home.

02:07.391 --> 02:08.358
Are you ready?

02:08.392 --> 02:09.893
Just tell me what I need to do.

02:09.928 --> 02:13.097
Okay, fire up the engines
and head to these coordinates.

02:13.131 --> 02:14.498
We'll be right there.

02:14.533 --> 02:15.633

02:39.858 --> 02:41.091
There they are!

02:41.126 --> 02:43.727
Artoo, hold her steady
and lower the boarding ramp.

02:43.762 --> 02:46.530
[R2-D2 beeps]

02:46.564 --> 02:47.898
Come on!

03:04.517 --> 03:06.218
Looks like our ride is here.

03:06.252 --> 03:08.720
Everyone get topside and stay down.

03:11.258 --> 03:12.825
But who's going to pilot the tank?

03:14.628 --> 03:16.396
Katooni, grab that mask.

03:19.066 --> 03:20.767
Uh, that'll have to do.

03:36.751 --> 03:37.751
[clacking]

03:39.788 --> 03:41.289
The steering must have come loose.

03:49.933 --> 03:51.266
We got him!

03:52.435 --> 03:53.602
Hang on!

03:55.005 --> 03:56.038

Oh, no.

Nice try, little Jedi.

05:15.383 --> 05:18.118
But it looks like you're coming with us.

[moaning]

What the--

05:39.317 --> 05:40.518

05:42.988 --> 05:44.689
It's an invasion.

[indistinct chatter]

Boss! Boss!

06:08.047 --> 06:09.114

06:09.149 --> 06:10.149
Gah!

06:13.987 --> 06:16.989
[blasters firing]

06:19.058 --> 06:20.592
Hondo.

06:20.626 --> 06:23.695
General Grievous, I presume?

06:23.729 --> 06:25.530
What a surprise.

06:25.564 --> 06:26.597
Have a seat.

06:26.632 --> 06:29.167
What, may I ask, is the honor?

06:30.436 --> 06:33.871
You can dispense with
the pleasantries, pirate.

06:33.906 --> 06:37.474
This planet is now under
Separatist control.

06:37.509 --> 06:39.610
Uh-huh.

06:39.644 --> 06:41.878
And what do you suppose that means?

06:41.913 --> 06:45.882
It means you have
a new master, pirate scum.

06:52.823 --> 06:55.892
Hondo Ohnaka, we meet again.

06:55.926 --> 06:58.795
As I recall the last time
we met face-to-face,

06:58.829 --> 07:00.030
I was your prisoner.

07:00.097 --> 07:01.097
Uh...

07:01.132 --> 07:02.966
And you attempted to barter me off

07:03.000 --> 07:04.501
to the highest bidder.

07:04.535 --> 07:05.669
But can you blame me?

07:05.737 --> 07:07.938
I mean, a Sith Lord.

07:07.973 --> 07:09.607
What a handsome price
you would--

07:09.641 --> 07:10.942
- Silence!

07:10.976 --> 07:13.945
You are going to pay the price
for your treachery.

07:13.980 --> 07:15.614
Well, I'm a reasonable man.

07:15.648 --> 07:16.615
Name the price.

07:16.649 --> 07:17.649
I'm sure we can reach--

07:17.683 --> 07:20.018
- There will be payment,
but no deals--

07:20.052 --> 07:21.586
only demands.

07:21.621 --> 07:24.489
Your entire arsenal will be melted down.

07:24.523 --> 07:27.992
Everything you own is now property

07:28.026 --> 07:29.927
of the Separatist Alliance.

07:29.961 --> 07:31.528
Now you go too far!

07:31.563 --> 07:33.130
Unacceptable!

07:33.164 --> 07:34.865
This is an outrage.

07:34.899 --> 07:35.999
This--

07:36.033 --> 07:37.000
Hold on.

07:37.034 --> 07:38.568
We can make a deal.

07:38.603 --> 07:41.672
This is not good business!

07:42.674 --> 07:44.008
This isn't good.

07:44.042 --> 07:46.811
Those scrappin' droids
are looting the place.

07:46.845 --> 07:48.912
They're dismantling our ships.

07:48.947 --> 07:51.715
The fact that Grievous is here
with his entire fleet

07:51.750 --> 07:54.384
means that Master Kenobi
must have been overrun.

07:54.419 --> 07:57.887
This entire system is now
in Separatist controlled space.

07:57.922 --> 07:59.389
What should we do?

07:59.423 --> 08:00.590
There's nowhere to run.

08:00.625 --> 08:03.293
You're not running anywhere, skug.

08:03.327 --> 08:05.262
You're still my prisoner.

08:05.296 --> 08:07.931
Maybe I can trade you to the Separatists

08:07.966 --> 08:09.967
in exchange for my freedom.

08:10.001 --> 08:11.735
Not likely.

08:11.770 --> 08:14.005
Grievous didn't come here to make deals.

08:14.039 --> 08:16.808
He already controls the planet
and the system.

08:16.842 --> 08:18.310
If you hand us over to him,

08:18.344 --> 08:20.446
he'll kill us and then you.

08:20.480 --> 08:22.515
We have a common enemy in Grievous.

08:22.549 --> 08:24.751
Together, we can get out of this.

08:24.785 --> 08:26.853
You must have
some other ships somewhere.

08:26.888 --> 08:28.155
You are pirates.

08:28.189 --> 08:30.457
Hondo's got a private fleet,

08:30.492 --> 08:33.126
but only he knows where the ships are.

08:33.160 --> 08:35.395
Then we'll have to rescue him.

08:35.429 --> 08:37.163
I know Grievous.

08:37.198 --> 08:38.631
And I know droids.

08:38.666 --> 08:41.335
With my help, you stand a better chance.

08:47.475 --> 08:48.442
[blaster fires]

08:49.777 --> 08:52.713
You got yourself a deal, Jedi.

09:03.959 --> 09:06.962
[R2-D2 chirps]

09:09.366 --> 09:10.833
Halt.

09:10.868 --> 09:12.635
[R2-D2 whistles]

09:12.670 --> 09:14.704
You captured this tank?

09:14.738 --> 09:16.739
Not bad for an astromech.

09:16.774 --> 09:18.608
[R2-D2 beeping]

09:18.642 --> 09:20.209
What's your ID number?

09:20.244 --> 09:23.246
[R2-D2 beeping]

09:24.314 --> 09:26.683
Hey, do not get smart with me.

09:26.717 --> 09:28.718
I outrank you.

09:28.752 --> 09:31.721
[R2-D2 beeping]

09:33.624 --> 09:35.391
You just watch yourself.

09:35.459 --> 09:38.360
I could have you melted down
with the rest of this junk.

09:38.395 --> 09:39.361
[R2-D2 whimpers]

09:39.396 --> 09:40.562
That's right.

09:40.597 --> 09:42.999
Now take it over to Hangar 12.

09:43.033 --> 09:44.300
[R2-D2 beeps]

09:44.334 --> 09:46.135
And no detours.

09:46.169 --> 09:47.937
We'll be watching you.

09:49.005 --> 09:51.974
[dramatic music]

09:57.481 --> 10:00.749
[groaning]

[blasters firing]

10:03.753 --> 10:06.755
[metal clanking]

10:09.960 --> 10:11.193
Jedi.

10:11.228 --> 10:14.363
And here I thought
you made your escape, no?

10:14.397 --> 10:15.731
No.

10:15.765 --> 10:17.733
There were complications.

10:17.767 --> 10:19.802
Now, we have to put
our differences aside

10:19.836 --> 10:21.036
and be friends,

10:21.070 --> 10:23.005
or else we're all gonna die here.

10:23.039 --> 10:25.874
Ah, very diplomatic.

10:25.942 --> 10:27.042
Ha!

10:27.076 --> 10:30.012
I knew you did not come back
to rescue Hondo,

10:30.046 --> 10:31.146
how do you say it?

10:31.181 --> 10:33.449
Out of the goodness of your hearts.

10:33.483 --> 10:35.084
No, no, no, no.

10:35.118 --> 10:37.920
You need something from me.

10:37.955 --> 10:39.889
A ship, to be specific.

10:39.924 --> 10:41.157
Ah, yes.

10:41.225 --> 10:42.492
A ship, a ship.

10:42.526 --> 10:46.229
Ah, but where would we find
one of those?

10:46.263 --> 10:49.933
My new friend General Grievous
has destroyed my ships.

10:49.967 --> 10:51.301
We know you have one,

10:51.336 --> 10:52.703
a whole pirate fleet.

10:53.872 --> 10:56.140
And one of my old friends, apparently,

10:56.174 --> 10:58.242
has been talking too much.

10:59.712 --> 11:01.946
Ah, what does it matter?

11:01.981 --> 11:03.481
We'll never reach the vault anyway.

11:03.516 --> 11:06.017
Grievous' army is way too big.

11:06.051 --> 11:07.018
Don't give up.

11:07.052 --> 11:08.253
We can fight.

11:08.287 --> 11:09.687
If I may, sir.

11:09.722 --> 11:13.424
I have instructed younglings
for over 1,000 generations,

11:13.458 --> 11:16.227
and these are among the best
I have ever seen.

11:17.296 --> 11:19.797
Well, then, show me.

11:19.832 --> 11:22.534
Show me your swords, tiny Jedi.

11:22.601 --> 11:25.971
Show Hondo you are ready to fight.

11:27.540 --> 11:28.974
Ah.

11:29.009 --> 11:30.242
And you, child.

11:30.277 --> 11:32.111
Where is your saber?

11:32.145 --> 11:33.813
It's not finished.

11:33.847 --> 11:35.115
I never finished it.

11:35.149 --> 11:36.683
I've done everything right,

11:36.717 --> 11:38.017
but it won't work.

11:38.052 --> 11:39.251
You must trust

11:39.286 --> 11:41.654
that the components
that form your lightsaber

11:41.688 --> 11:43.689
are meant to be together.

11:43.723 --> 11:45.290
There is no other way.

11:45.325 --> 11:47.926
It is the Force that binds them.

11:47.961 --> 11:49.495
Yes, I was just going to say that.

11:49.529 --> 11:50.496
Finish it now.

11:50.530 --> 11:51.697
Finish, finish!

11:51.731 --> 11:54.667
This is worth the price of a ship.

11:54.701 --> 11:57.703
To see the construction
of a Jedi lightsaber,

11:57.738 --> 12:00.606
this--this is priceless.

12:00.641 --> 12:01.741
Finish it,

12:01.775 --> 12:04.910
and together, we can defeat Grievous.

12:12.419 --> 12:13.852
Oh.

12:13.887 --> 12:15.120
Amazing.

12:15.155 --> 12:18.156
[laughing]

12:19.625 --> 12:21.259
That is truly amazing.

12:29.567 --> 12:31.668
Well, cut me down, little Jedi.

12:31.702 --> 12:32.936
It's time to leave.

12:38.309 --> 12:41.878
[all cheering]

12:41.913 --> 12:43.313
So why the big show?

12:43.348 --> 12:45.282
You didn't really have a choice.

12:45.316 --> 12:47.150
You know we have to work together.

12:47.185 --> 12:49.019
Because, Jedi,

12:49.053 --> 12:53.657
you know what we are about to
attempt is very dangerous.

12:53.691 --> 12:55.592
And I may be a pirate,

12:55.660 --> 12:59.596
but I do not like
taking children into battle.

12:59.664 --> 13:02.099
That didn't seem to bother you
when you attacked us.

13:02.133 --> 13:04.168
[laughs]

13:04.202 --> 13:05.936
Well, today is a new day,

13:05.970 --> 13:08.038
and lucky for you, today,

13:08.072 --> 13:09.539
I like children.

13:09.574 --> 13:11.374
Now, let's free the rest of my men.

13:14.345 --> 13:17.313
[voices clamoring]

13:30.085 --> 13:33.087
[engine rumbling]

13:38.125 --> 13:40.092
[electronic beeping]

13:40.127 --> 13:42.028
This is OOM-87, General.

13:42.062 --> 13:44.164
The prison area is under attack.

13:44.198 --> 13:46.733
There are several miniature Jedi here.

13:46.767 --> 13:48.034
What?

13:48.068 --> 13:49.969
You aren't making any sense.

13:50.004 --> 13:51.171
What Jedi?

13:51.205 --> 13:52.339
The little ones,

13:52.373 --> 13:54.040
half the size of normal Jedi.

13:54.075 --> 13:55.509
They're freeing the prisoners
and--

13:55.543 --> 13:56.610
my knees!

13:56.644 --> 13:57.744
[screams]

13:59.213 --> 14:00.146
[growls]

14:00.214 --> 14:01.948
Prepare to open fire.

14:01.982 --> 14:04.751
We will bring the building down
on their heads.

14:14.395 --> 14:17.396
[cannons firing]

14:21.902 --> 14:24.871
[blasters firing]

14:54.336 --> 14:55.402
I got your back.

14:55.437 --> 14:56.670
[sarcastically] Great.

14:56.705 --> 14:57.905
I feel so safe.

15:01.543 --> 15:03.144
[R2-D2 beeping]

15:04.513 --> 15:07.514
[cannon fires]

15:13.922 --> 15:15.656
[laughs]

15:15.690 --> 15:17.358
They run.

15:17.392 --> 15:18.359
Quickly.

15:18.393 --> 15:19.360
After them.

15:19.394 --> 15:22.363
[engine whirring]

15:38.180 --> 15:41.182
[blasters firing]

15:48.490 --> 15:50.458
[explosion]

16:02.437 --> 16:04.004
They went the wrong way.

16:04.038 --> 16:05.639
Don't worry.

16:29.331 --> 16:30.564
What about the others?

16:30.599 --> 16:32.299
We can't just leave them.

16:32.334 --> 16:34.769
You are welcome to come, small one.

16:34.803 --> 16:37.804
You may join our merry band of pirates.

16:37.839 --> 16:39.739
I won't just run away.

16:39.774 --> 16:41.842
Ahsoka trusted you.

16:41.876 --> 16:43.210
We all trusted you.

16:45.013 --> 16:47.047
[sighs]

16:56.258 --> 16:57.224
Artoo, do something.

16:57.259 --> 16:58.292
[R2-D2 beeps]

16:58.326 --> 16:59.293
I don't know.

16:59.327 --> 17:00.861
We have to shake Grievous off.

17:00.896 --> 17:02.697
Get aggressive.
Ah!

17:18.547 --> 17:20.048
Too aggressive.

17:20.082 --> 17:21.817
Far too aggressive.

17:21.851 --> 17:24.853
[grunts]

17:27.657 --> 17:29.692
[R2-D2 chirps]

17:29.727 --> 17:32.629
Yes, well, it was an effective strategy,

17:32.663 --> 17:34.698
but not what I would recommend.

17:40.038 --> 17:41.605
[moaning]

17:41.640 --> 17:44.608
[metallic clanking]

17:47.112 --> 17:50.081
[dramatic music]

17:56.622 --> 17:59.023
[laughs]

17:59.058 --> 18:02.960
So many lightsabers
to add to my collection.

18:02.995 --> 18:05.129
[clacking]

18:05.163 --> 18:08.132
[engine rumbling]

18:14.806 --> 18:15.772
Hurry!

18:15.840 --> 18:16.773
Come on!

18:16.841 --> 18:18.241
Run.

18:18.276 --> 18:19.943
All of you run!

18:34.525 --> 18:36.359
[grunts]

18:36.393 --> 18:37.660
[coughs]

18:41.566 --> 18:42.933
[grunting]

18:48.606 --> 18:51.942
[grunts]

18:51.976 --> 18:52.943
[groans]

18:52.977 --> 18:54.378
Ha!

19:13.364 --> 19:14.331
Ahsoka!

19:14.365 --> 19:15.332
Come on!

19:15.366 --> 19:16.766
Ahsoka, come on!

19:22.873 --> 19:25.908
You will never defeat Grievous.

19:25.942 --> 19:27.610
Never!

19:29.145 --> 19:31.412
I wouldn't be so sure.

19:31.447 --> 19:34.415
[blaster firing]

19:35.651 --> 19:36.717
Did we get him?

19:36.751 --> 19:37.718
I can't tell.

19:37.752 --> 19:40.721
[cannons firing]

19:43.992 --> 19:45.460
Show is over, kiddies.

19:45.494 --> 19:46.728
Let's get out of here.

19:55.105 --> 19:57.807
[laughing]

20:09.287 --> 20:12.289
[snorting]

20:13.725 --> 20:15.425
And let me see.

20:15.460 --> 20:17.060
Oh, the cost of the fuel.

20:17.095 --> 20:19.296
I had to use a lot of fuel.

20:19.363 --> 20:22.799
The general wear and tear
on my men and equipment.

20:22.834 --> 20:25.802
A couple of them died, I think.

20:25.837 --> 20:27.237
Believe me, Kenobi.

20:27.271 --> 20:28.505
[sighs]

20:28.539 --> 20:32.109
Staging a rescue is not
an inexpensive proposition.

20:32.143 --> 20:35.212
So you mean to tell me
you were staging a rescue,

20:35.280 --> 20:38.449
not attempting to hijack
a Jedi starship?

20:38.483 --> 20:39.984
You're welcome!

20:40.018 --> 20:42.119
Oh, the thanklessness!

20:42.154 --> 20:43.587
What an accusation.

20:43.622 --> 20:44.588
I am gone!

20:44.623 --> 20:46.357
I will send you my bill!

21:07.412 --> 21:09.045
Ahsoka.

21:09.079 --> 21:10.513
It's good to see you're all safe.

21:10.548 --> 21:12.015
Yes, Master.

21:12.049 --> 21:14.284
We had quite an eventful mission.

21:14.318 --> 21:16.220
The most eventful since the time

21:16.254 --> 21:19.923
Master Yoda went to find
his lightsaber crystal.

21:19.957 --> 21:20.924
What?

21:20.958 --> 21:21.925
Oh!

21:21.959 --> 21:23.393
- Tell us!
- What happened then?

21:23.427 --> 21:26.996
I'm afraid that story will have to wait.

21:27.030 --> 21:28.598
For now, be proud.

21:28.632 --> 21:31.134
You have survived an ordeal
few your age could.

21:33.770 --> 21:36.472
Welcome home, young Jedi.

21:52.454 --> 21:54.422
[orchestral fanfare]
