00:07.131 --> 00:08.924
Forty-two!

00:11.553 --> 00:13.471
Forty-two!

00:14.179 --> 00:15.765
Yes, that's me.

00:15.932 --> 00:17.891
Lena Harmiento Jimenez.

00:18.059 --> 00:21.478
Your passport application
is very incomplete.

00:21.646 --> 00:25.608
For purpose of visit you have "sister,"
but there's no address.

00:25.774 --> 00:27.568
Do you have it?

00:27.736 --> 00:29.070
No.

00:29.236 --> 00:31.905
Where in the United States
are you going?

00:32.073 --> 00:33.408
Minnesota.

00:33.575 --> 00:34.576
Minnesota.

00:34.743 --> 00:38.788
No employment, no credit card,
no tourist visa.

00:38.954 --> 00:40.957
Can your sister sponsor you?

00:41.124 --> 00:43.292
She's 12 years old.

00:45.045 --> 00:50.884
You are a minor.
Can you get your parents to sign?

00:51.426 --> 00:53.386
I can't do that.

00:54.345 --> 00:55.637
Why?

00:56.055 --> 00:57.640
They are dead.

00:59.350 --> 01:00.851
I can't help you.

01:02.478 --> 01:05.689
I really need this visa.

01:09.652 --> 01:11.403
You need to find another way.

01:11.570 --> 01:13.114
Next!

03:32.294 --> 03:33.796
No? No problem.

03:33.962 --> 03:37.633
Padre, I need help. I found this watch
in the square. You see?

03:37.800 --> 03:40.427
I think it's gold. You see?

03:41.012 --> 03:43.723
Padre, I know you're an honest man.

03:43.889 --> 03:46.600
I can't take this to my home
because my uncle...

03:46.768 --> 03:49.729
I don't know where this is going,
but I know where it ends.

03:49.895 --> 03:53.440
With me out of pocket
and holding a plastic watch.

03:53.608 --> 03:57.569
- Padre, such dark thoughts.
- Fuck dark thoughts.

03:59.864 --> 04:03.283
You'd be more convincing
if you flashed a better timepiece.

04:03.450 --> 04:07.454
And you'd be more convincing, Padre,
if you hid your bottle.

04:22.928 --> 04:24.930
It's a hot day, seÃ±or.

04:26.850 --> 04:29.102
A tourist, no?

04:29.269 --> 04:32.146
You must see the bullfight tonight.

04:32.312 --> 04:36.442
The matador, he is lethal.

04:36.942 --> 04:40.279
It's fun to watch a man kill an animal?

04:40.947 --> 04:45.285
Oh, no, no, no.
I'm just making small talk.

04:45.576 --> 04:48.454
No small talk with him, friend.

04:49.831 --> 04:51.081
Got a phone call.

04:51.249 --> 04:53.960
Your padre just rode into a small town.

04:54.127 --> 04:55.961
Southwest.

04:56.545 --> 04:59.507
All right, call all your compadres.

04:59.673 --> 05:03.635
Tell them that if they catch him,
we double the reward.

05:05.221 --> 05:07.848
You practice strange economics.

05:08.016 --> 05:10.518
Justice isn't commerce.

05:11.060 --> 05:12.394
Okay.

05:12.562 --> 05:15.689
I looked at his warrant.
They're all for petty crime.

05:15.857 --> 05:20.236
So why is a retired U.S. marshal
hunting this guy on his own dime?

05:20.403 --> 05:22.864
Is this personal?

05:23.031 --> 05:28.203
You think I'd be here paying
for your badge if it wasn't personal?

05:28.370 --> 05:30.829
Okay, it's personal.

05:34.584 --> 05:37.670
You know,
they say when you seek revenge...

05:37.836 --> 05:40.714
...you must dig two graves.

05:43.425 --> 05:45.177
Hot day today.

05:46.805 --> 05:49.641
So hot, it makes the bulls angry.

05:51.892 --> 05:54.895
Say goodbye to your matador.

05:56.523 --> 05:57.607
All right.

06:35.144 --> 06:36.937
Share.

06:37.105 --> 06:39.649
- Lots of change.
- Yeah.

06:40.858 --> 06:45.154
Esteban won't even haggle
with me anymore.

06:45.321 --> 06:47.407
Now he just makes the cross
and takes what I give him.

06:49.867 --> 06:52.077
- The arepas?
- What?

06:52.245 --> 06:53.620
The arepas?

06:53.997 --> 06:55.999
I forgot.

06:56.290 --> 06:57.666
I'll get them tomorrow.

06:57.834 --> 06:59.043
Why tomorrow?

06:59.209 --> 07:03.130
My school group is going
to the waterfall this afternoon.

07:03.298 --> 07:04.548
I work today.

07:04.716 --> 07:07.093
You're watching my kids.

07:07.259 --> 07:09.846
See, I've worked it out. Anna will come.

07:10.012 --> 07:13.265
You pay her,
add it to my rent so I can go.

07:13.432 --> 07:15.310
No, Lena.

07:15.476 --> 07:19.104
This isn't why I took you in.

07:21.190 --> 07:25.027
Lena, soon you'll have your own family.

07:25.194 --> 07:26.987
Then you'll understand.

07:34.579 --> 07:35.622
Lena?

07:35.997 --> 07:38.375
Lena, are you listening to me?

07:38.750 --> 07:41.752
I have a family. But not here.

07:42.545 --> 07:43.838
Oh, honey.

07:46.216 --> 07:47.634
There's nothing here.

07:47.800 --> 07:50.010
I'll get the arepas.

08:13.910 --> 08:16.413
No. No. No.

08:16.579 --> 08:20.375
I won't let you rob me twice in one day!

08:20.541 --> 08:21.959
Six thousand for stale cheese bread.

08:22.127 --> 08:23.627
With what you charge,
you accuse me of robbery?

08:23.795 --> 08:27.757
A wolf can smell another wolf
clear across the forest.

08:36.515 --> 08:37.515
What do you think?

08:38.600 --> 08:41.104
If he's a padre, I'm the pope.

08:48.528 --> 08:51.990
I was afraid of this. They see a tourist,
from out of town...

08:52.157 --> 08:55.701
...doesn't speak the language,
and charge 10 times the price.

08:55.869 --> 08:58.538
- Ask for a refund. You have a receipt?
- I have it.

08:59.288 --> 09:02.125
- Let me get that for you.
- Yeah.

09:02.542 --> 09:05.045
Padre. A word?

09:08.005 --> 09:09.173
Just a tick.

09:10.799 --> 09:12.426
Gentlemen.

09:14.053 --> 09:17.222
- It's morning.
- Yes, it is.

09:17.682 --> 09:21.019
You seem like men of some importance.
How can I help you?

09:21.186 --> 09:24.980
- You are scaring off the tourists.
- I'm a tourist myself.

09:26.149 --> 09:29.443
We are a quiet town.

09:29.610 --> 09:32.739
Your type isn't wanted.

09:34.490 --> 09:35.616
What are you doing?

09:36.283 --> 09:38.410
You can't just chuck me out of town.

09:38.577 --> 09:42.164
- I'll call the police.
- No police.

09:42.749 --> 09:44.875
There is a bus in an hour.

09:45.043 --> 09:46.669
Take it.

09:57.221 --> 09:59.223
Another headache.

09:59.390 --> 10:01.558
Let me do the talking.

10:11.068 --> 10:13.112
Have you seen this man?

10:15.740 --> 10:19.411
He was seen entering this town.

10:19.619 --> 10:23.163
Does he look familiar?

10:46.687 --> 10:49.231
He's here. It has that smell.

10:49.399 --> 10:50.482
Listen.

10:50.649 --> 10:53.028
We have money.

10:57.740 --> 10:59.158
Was he smelling me?

10:59.908 --> 11:01.410
Never mind him.

11:01.577 --> 11:06.165
His brain is deep-fried like a pork rind.

11:08.999 --> 11:09.376
Have another look.

11:17.677 --> 11:22.098
He masquerades as a priest,
sometimes a salesman. But he's not.

11:22.264 --> 11:25.976
- What does he sell?
- He says he sells pots, pans, medicines...

11:26.144 --> 11:28.270
And these things aren't real?

11:29.313 --> 11:31.565
No, they're real.

11:31.732 --> 11:34.193
Then why wouldn't I buy them?

11:34.360 --> 11:36.571
Look, do they know him or not?

11:39.532 --> 11:40.575
Lena?

11:41.033 --> 11:42.619
Did you get the arepas?

11:42.785 --> 11:44.078
Lena?

11:44.245 --> 11:45.788
The arepas?

11:45.996 --> 11:48.832
Call Anna. Sell everything.

11:49.000 --> 11:50.043
What?

11:50.543 --> 11:51.794
Have you seen him?

11:53.462 --> 11:54.963
It's hard to say.

11:55.130 --> 11:56.466
Your picture is so dirty.

12:01.011 --> 12:03.013
He said "money"?

12:24.410 --> 12:26.203
Fuck's sake.

12:26.955 --> 12:28.163
So if we saw this man?

12:28.331 --> 12:31.042
Man, $5000, like it says.

12:31.208 --> 12:33.669
Can we please get this dance over with?

12:33.836 --> 12:35.337
For fuck's sake.

12:35.504 --> 12:38.591
Federico! A gringo priest stole your car!

12:39.426 --> 12:42.429
Okay, let's go. He's driving a Lincoln.

12:57.235 --> 12:59.361
- Where are we going?
- Jesus Christ!

13:01.322 --> 13:02.365
Remember me?

13:07.412 --> 13:10.540
- Get out.
- Okay. Explain it to them.

13:12.167 --> 13:13.375
Jesus Christ.

13:21.926 --> 13:23.802
Okay, they are getting close.

13:25.179 --> 13:26.889
For fuck's sake.

13:31.769 --> 13:36.441
- You know you're not coming with me.
- Okay, then let me out here.

13:36.607 --> 13:41.111
Let me tell the police how
a white padre kidnapped a poor orphan.

13:47.951 --> 13:50.705
- Shit, they're in the valley.
- I can see that.

13:50.871 --> 13:51.914
It's like a maze.

13:52.081 --> 13:54.375
That's why I got you.
You're the local.

13:54.542 --> 13:57.961
It's a big country.
You know your way around Cincinnati?

14:02.258 --> 14:03.677
- To the right. Here!
- Where?

14:14.144 --> 14:17.148
See? You need my help.

14:17.315 --> 14:20.276
All right, next town,
get out, you can walk home.

14:20.442 --> 14:23.822
I can't. It's so far away.
I don't have good shoes.

14:23.988 --> 14:25.573
I'll buy you some shoes.

14:25.740 --> 14:27.701
- And it's cold.
- And a sweater.

14:27.866 --> 14:30.495
- And it's dark.
- And a fucking flashlight.

14:33.206 --> 14:36.418
- How'd you know which car to hide in?
- It's Federico's car.

14:36.583 --> 14:39.753
He never locks it.
No one steals from Federico.

14:39.921 --> 14:42.841
- What? Why not?
- Because he's the mayor.

14:43.841 --> 14:47.177
You need me. You will be lost
in this country without me.

14:47.761 --> 14:50.347
I'll buy a map, it'll talk less.

14:54.601 --> 14:57.396
There's your clothes,
our business is done.

14:59.606 --> 15:03.278
- Don't drink when you drive me.
- I'm not driving you anywhere.

15:03.445 --> 15:05.405
Well, I have an offer.

15:05.572 --> 15:08.658
I'm not accepting
any propositions right now.

15:09.158 --> 15:12.703
What if I pay you
if you drive me to the city?

15:12.870 --> 15:14.329
I'm not driving you anywhere.

15:14.873 --> 15:17.876
And then, in the city,
you help me with my plan.

15:18.043 --> 15:20.961
It's a good plan.
And for you, you have money.

15:21.129 --> 15:23.298
Like you never imagined.

15:24.298 --> 15:25.632
What's your name?

15:25.799 --> 15:28.385
- Lena.
- Well, Lena, fuck off home.

15:28.552 --> 15:31.139
Your family's probably worried sick.

15:38.730 --> 15:40.481
What do you need me for?
Take the bus.

15:40.648 --> 15:43.317
Because you're white
and your skin is like a passport.

15:43.485 --> 15:46.904
- Everything's easier for you.
- It hasn't felt that way so far.

15:48.197 --> 15:50.699
What color is a Band-Aid
where you're from?

15:52.534 --> 15:56.497
See? Same here,
same in Africa, same everywhere.

15:56.663 --> 15:59.458
It's easy. White.

16:03.171 --> 16:06.758
- So, what's the plan?
- First, drive, then the plan.

16:11.638 --> 16:13.556
Holy shit.

16:15.350 --> 16:19.062
Like I said, no one steals from Federico.

16:24.317 --> 16:26.068
Thank you very much.

16:31.658 --> 16:33.158
What?

16:33.701 --> 16:37.996
You know, we're not exactly
in a strong position to negotiate.

16:38.163 --> 16:40.332
You get us nothing.

16:40.500 --> 16:44.004
- This is something.
- Yeah, this is something.

16:44.169 --> 16:47.423
Congratulations, Padre.
You made a miracle.

16:47.590 --> 16:50.134
You turned the wine into water.

16:50.301 --> 16:54.305
And, also, you owe me 700
for half the car.

16:54.471 --> 16:56.975
You know, this isn't a joint venture.

16:57.642 --> 16:59.394
I stole the car, it's my car.

16:59.561 --> 17:01.146
You don't like it...

17:01.312 --> 17:03.815
...find yourself another fucking gringo.

17:05.316 --> 17:10.904
- I'm just saying, could've got more.
- Go and renegotiate, then!

17:14.826 --> 17:16.911
You know, I can be very convincing.

17:22.083 --> 17:23.125
Put that down.

17:23.291 --> 17:27.671
- What? Okay, just drive.
- I know how to use that, you don't.

17:27.838 --> 17:32.301
I got enough on my mind
without the blood of a fucking orphan.

17:39.142 --> 17:40.559
Oi.

17:42.811 --> 17:45.064
- Oi.
- What?

17:46.191 --> 17:47.733
Did you go through my bag?

17:49.152 --> 17:50.362
No.

17:53.448 --> 17:56.326
Okay, yes.
Because, obviously, I don't trust you.

18:02.624 --> 18:04.834
Police, ma'am.

18:05.542 --> 18:08.003
We hear there's a girl named Lena
who is missing.

18:08.171 --> 18:10.256
Do you know anything?

18:10.964 --> 18:12.966
I'll make some coffee.

18:24.061 --> 18:26.146
Delicious coffee.

18:27.231 --> 18:29.317
Delicious coffee.

18:30.109 --> 18:31.777
Say something nice, come on.

18:37.366 --> 18:39.451
So, what are you?

18:39.868 --> 18:40.953
His pet?

18:41.121 --> 18:44.040
I have two kids in university.

18:44.207 --> 18:46.292
The money has to come
from somewhere.

18:46.459 --> 18:48.420
Where is the girl?

18:53.590 --> 18:56.885
Ask her if she knows where she's going.

18:59.221 --> 19:01.016
How much?

19:01.182 --> 19:02.182
No, no, seÃ±or.

19:02.892 --> 19:04.436
You people can't buy everything.

19:05.644 --> 19:06.645
Take it.

19:06.813 --> 19:10.900
Not everything is yours to take.
Now you threaten me? Go on.

19:11.067 --> 19:14.570
Tell her she's aiding a known fugitive.

19:17.574 --> 19:19.075
Please.

19:19.659 --> 19:21.745
Can you tell us where she is?

19:22.412 --> 19:26.332
If Lena doesn't want to be found,
then she's not going to be found.

19:26.499 --> 19:29.919
- She's not gonna be found.
- Any friends nearby?

19:30.086 --> 19:32.630
Does she have family or friends?

19:32.797 --> 19:35.924
No, no one is more alone than Lena.

19:36.300 --> 19:38.720
You have no idea who she is.

19:39.679 --> 19:42.724
What can you tell us?

19:43.767 --> 19:46.936
God called Lena's parents
when she was 8.

19:47.103 --> 19:50.648
She had no other family.
It was just her and her baby sister.

19:51.357 --> 19:55.694
When they were orphaned, they were sent
to a church orphanage in the city.

19:55.862 --> 20:00.115
Her and her little sister were taken
to a church orphanage in the city.

20:00.282 --> 20:02.659
First God takes her parents...

20:02.826 --> 20:06.748
...and then a family in Minnesota
takes her sister.

20:06.914 --> 20:09.166
Like they bought her on the Internet.

20:09.334 --> 20:11.920
A family in Minnesota bought her sister
from a website.

20:12.086 --> 20:15.964
So this girl, at 11 years old,
is completely alone.

20:16.132 --> 20:19.552
Fucked over three ways,
like everyone Latino.

20:20.428 --> 20:22.222
By the Church...

20:22.388 --> 20:23.639
...white men...

20:24.348 --> 20:25.474
...and money.

20:25.642 --> 20:28.186
The girl was fucked over
by the Church, white men, money.

20:29.144 --> 20:34.442
So now, you come here to my house...

20:34.608 --> 20:36.819
...and you want me
to help you find her?

20:36.986 --> 20:39.239
Why? To hurt her more?

20:39.405 --> 20:40.615
No, sir!

20:40.824 --> 20:44.994
I'd sooner cut up your other cheek!

20:50.458 --> 20:52.377
What'd I say?

21:39.715 --> 21:41.342
So sorry.

21:45.262 --> 21:46.347
Hey.

21:46.513 --> 21:48.432
Get ready for work.

21:51.227 --> 21:53.605
- Teach me how to pick pockets.
- Oi!

21:55.147 --> 21:57.107
Knock it off, you.

21:57.650 --> 21:59.277
Where we going? A bar?

21:59.443 --> 22:02.154
You don't pay enough to cover drinks.

22:02.321 --> 22:05.115
Bad way to talk to your boss. I can help.

22:12.624 --> 22:14.041
Here.

22:15.376 --> 22:17.378
Buy something small.

22:17.961 --> 22:19.506
- Not there.
- Why not?

22:19.673 --> 22:21.215
It's a little shop.

22:21.383 --> 22:24.969
- Well, we only need a little.
- For them, a little is a lot.

22:30.266 --> 22:32.018
All right. Fine.

23:05.009 --> 23:07.511
Can I get a 60-minute phone card,
please?

23:07.679 --> 23:08.721
Here you go.

23:19.898 --> 23:22.943
This is change for 5, I gave you a 50.

23:23.111 --> 23:26.531
A 50. My bill has a name on it.

23:26.698 --> 23:29.117
A name. Writing on it. "Colin."

23:30.451 --> 23:33.246
Fifty. There, that's the one.

23:33.413 --> 23:37.541
- Sorry. It's my mistake, Padre.
- Yeah, oldest trick in the book, mate.

23:58.563 --> 24:00.565
You said, "Buy something small."

24:03.026 --> 24:04.402
What can I get for you?

24:05.444 --> 24:07.446
I'll have what he's having.

24:07.780 --> 24:09.281
For you?

24:12.368 --> 24:14.370
Bring me something red.

24:17.832 --> 24:20.627
Tell me, why that guy
with the policia want you?

24:21.251 --> 24:23.046
No idea.

24:26.090 --> 24:27.675
Tell me.

24:29.551 --> 24:30.969
I knew his daughter.

24:32.055 --> 24:33.682
All right, my turn.

24:33.847 --> 24:37.976
- Why are we going to the city?
- To rob a church.

24:40.814 --> 24:43.441
- You wanna rob a church?
- I have my reasons.

24:43.607 --> 24:46.819
- What are they?
- They stole from me.

24:46.986 --> 24:51.366
They stole my land,
and they stole my sister.

24:52.075 --> 24:53.742
I'm going to get her back.

24:55.619 --> 24:57.287
All right.

25:02.126 --> 25:04.712
- Something red.
- Cheers.

25:12.595 --> 25:15.973
This is the church orphanage
I grew up in.

25:16.807 --> 25:19.477
And they have this famous cup,
you see?

25:19.644 --> 25:21.104
It's gold. Yes?

25:21.270 --> 25:23.981
They say if you drink from it...

25:24.148 --> 25:26.859
...your worst sin is forgiven.

25:29.237 --> 25:31.072
Just the one?

25:31.698 --> 25:33.490
The biggest one.

25:33.657 --> 25:36.452
You got a big sin to confess, do you?

25:39.580 --> 25:41.206
More big questions.

25:41.374 --> 25:43.293
All right, just a little one.

25:44.336 --> 25:48.173
- How comes your English is so good?
- I think English is important.

25:48.339 --> 25:50.341
What, for robbing a church?

25:52.594 --> 25:54.554
No more questions.

25:59.768 --> 26:01.935
I think I might have made a mistake.

26:02.686 --> 26:06.398
I think you must have made
a lot of mistakes to end up here.

26:09.861 --> 26:11.278
Oi!

26:27.545 --> 26:31.383
You didn't buy pajamas,
so this is your shirt...

26:31.548 --> 26:33.300
...and your underwear.

26:33.468 --> 26:35.428
You should sleep in the bath.

26:35.595 --> 26:39.848
- No, I puke in there.
- Should've done it in the toilet like a lady.

26:40.432 --> 26:43.019
I was peeing at the time.

27:24.894 --> 27:27.605
You don't like salsa,
you don't like cha-cha.

27:27.771 --> 27:30.149
You don't wanna go
to my mom's house for dinner.

27:30.316 --> 27:32.777
You don't like hockey.
What do you like?

27:35.488 --> 27:39.284
I know you don't like talking to me.
You won't tell me who this padre is.

27:39.451 --> 27:41.618
You won't tell me what he did to you.

27:41.786 --> 27:43.913
This is the last chop shop in the valley.

27:44.079 --> 27:47.041
You don't wanna talk to me,
don't talk to me, I'm good.

27:47.208 --> 27:49.753
So you let me do the talking this time.

27:49.919 --> 27:51.921
You have a way, 'mano.

27:52.087 --> 27:55.299
A way to remind them
that you're just not any gringo...

27:55.467 --> 27:56.968
...but every gringo.

28:12.776 --> 28:15.153
- Car or a truck?
- Car.

28:15.862 --> 28:18.281
He bought one yesterday.

28:19.490 --> 28:21.201
I buy a lot of cars.

28:21.367 --> 28:23.787
- It's a Lincoln.
- Lincoln?

28:24.412 --> 28:27.790
Big, loud, American.

28:27.957 --> 28:29.417
It's stolen.

28:29.584 --> 28:31.544
Not necessarily.

28:32.127 --> 28:34.505
Maybe it's just lost.

28:34.963 --> 28:36.883
Forever.

28:40.804 --> 28:43.223
All I wanna do is look at it.

28:43.390 --> 28:45.975
You know what he's driving now?

28:54.901 --> 28:56.236
Anything?

28:56.403 --> 28:58.195
- Phone card.
- Yeah?

28:58.363 --> 28:59.780
Half a bottle of Guaro.

28:59.948 --> 29:02.033
Well, that ain't nothing.

29:02.200 --> 29:04.411
You must never had the thirst.

29:04.576 --> 29:08.123
Otherwise, you'd know
you keep track of every ounce.

29:08.288 --> 29:10.458
Got half a bottle.

29:17.548 --> 29:20.175
You know, he's distracted.

29:23.805 --> 29:26.725
How many churches are in this city?

29:26.891 --> 29:29.728
You know,
ones that take care of orphans.

29:29.894 --> 29:34.065
You can't throw a rock in this country
without hitting a church window.

29:36.233 --> 29:39.570
Well, we know what horse he rides.

29:58.298 --> 30:00.467
Finally, you're awake.

30:00.884 --> 30:02.384
I buy you gasolina.

30:03.135 --> 30:04.803
Jolly good.

30:04.971 --> 30:07.766
- What are you doing?
- Bring me that, would you?

30:08.266 --> 30:09.433
For what?

30:09.601 --> 30:12.771
Because, contrary to popular belief,
I am an honest salesman.

30:13.313 --> 30:17.484
And, if we're gonna rob your church,
we're gonna need a lot more cash.

30:17.650 --> 30:20.070
Or is that against your moral code?

30:20.528 --> 30:21.738
No.

30:21.904 --> 30:24.240
They charge you too much for this room.

30:42.342 --> 30:43.509
Pure Egyptian cotton.

30:45.636 --> 30:47.429
Only been used once by a baby.

30:48.347 --> 30:49.348
Smell it.

30:55.270 --> 30:58.524
Signed by the Pope Francisco.
I give it to you for 10,000.

30:58.692 --> 31:00.943
We heard about you.

31:01.861 --> 31:03.153
Big reward for you.

31:04.364 --> 31:06.074
- Time to go.
- Wait, wait.

31:09.661 --> 31:11.871
Sir, please come here.

31:12.413 --> 31:15.290
I saw him paint it with my own eyes.

31:15.834 --> 31:18.878
It will be valuable after they hang him.

31:24.718 --> 31:26.010
What was that about?

31:26.176 --> 31:29.221
I say they pay more money for it
when they kill you.

31:29.388 --> 31:31.140
Oh, well, fuck them, then.

31:31.307 --> 31:33.684
You know what?
Maybe I should paint more.

31:49.034 --> 31:50.618
No, he's a fucking hippy.

31:50.785 --> 31:52.202
- No money?
- No money.

31:57.250 --> 31:59.085
- Him.
- Him.

32:04.007 --> 32:05.467
Sorry about your melon.

32:05.633 --> 32:10.055
It's the most rare fruit in the whole world.
You know how expensive it is?

32:10.221 --> 32:12.182
Oi. Go on.

32:12.348 --> 32:13.724
Go on! Out of here.

32:15.518 --> 32:16.853
Still got your wallet?

32:17.019 --> 32:19.271
- Yeah. Thanks, Father. Yeah.
- Sure?

32:19.439 --> 32:21.566
- I'm all right. Yeah.
- All right.

32:21.732 --> 32:25.194
Same thing happened to me.
It's called a "melon drop."

32:25.362 --> 32:29.074
There's more kids on the street
every day since the school shut.

32:29.240 --> 32:32.201
We tried to open them,
through the church...

32:32.368 --> 32:34.536
...but it's a poor town...

32:36.830 --> 32:39.166
...and donations are pretty slim.

32:39.709 --> 32:43.254
- How much you take?
- I didn't take, he gave.

32:43.421 --> 32:46.216
- Elegant.
- Better than picking his pocket.

32:46.383 --> 32:48.300
I also picked his pocket.

32:48.468 --> 32:50.595
You need to teach me how to do that.

32:58.728 --> 33:01.314
So now we leave, right?
You pay the bill?

33:01.480 --> 33:03.732
Why? It's easy money here.

33:03.900 --> 33:05.610
That's when you get caught.

33:05.777 --> 33:07.528
I'm not afraid.

33:08.613 --> 33:11.240
Do you know
what your Bible says about women?

33:12.157 --> 33:13.367
My Bible?

33:13.535 --> 33:15.787
They laugh with no fear of the future.

33:15.953 --> 33:18.623
- What does it mean?
- It means don't get cocky.

33:18.789 --> 33:20.082
All right?

33:28.924 --> 33:30.467
How much we owe you?

33:34.346 --> 33:36.307
Oh, fuck.

33:37.892 --> 33:40.019
And give me that candy.

33:40.185 --> 33:41.980
That one?

33:43.647 --> 33:45.399
This one here? Or the marshmallows?

33:45.567 --> 33:48.528
No, the one on the bottom.
To the left. Add it to the bill.

33:49.403 --> 33:54.451
Hey! What are you doing?
Dipping from my till?!

33:54.616 --> 33:56.161
Miss, your ID.

33:58.288 --> 34:00.289
Little scum. I saw her.

34:00.457 --> 34:01.666
She's with me.

34:01.833 --> 34:04.627
Our church rehabilitates wayward youth.

34:05.878 --> 34:11.342
As Jesus walked amongst the sinners,
so we try to walk his path.

34:11.509 --> 34:14.971
- What are you talking about?
- Orphans. Show him your fingers.

34:15.137 --> 34:18.141
Show him your fingers.
You see that? You see that?

34:18.306 --> 34:21.311
That's authentic orphan dirt, that is.

34:21.768 --> 34:23.813
Can't put a price on it.

34:24.356 --> 34:27.609
Now, if you'll just let me pay the bill.

34:27.775 --> 34:29.652
And for the candy.

34:31.905 --> 34:35.158
And for any misunderstandings.

34:35.324 --> 34:37.368
That was fucking amateur hour.

34:37.534 --> 34:41.246
- You said we laugh without fear, Padre.
- Yeah, well....

34:41.414 --> 34:43.833
Oi, you owe me
33 percent fucking-up tax.

34:44.000 --> 34:46.001
A special orphan rate.

34:48.213 --> 34:49.797
Now I can't do this.

34:49.963 --> 34:52.299
- Do what?
- Send you to the police...

34:52.467 --> 34:56.221
- ...when I'm done with you.
- Oh, fucking charming.

35:11.318 --> 35:13.987
You should try one of these.
They are so good.

35:14.155 --> 35:17.242
Barriletes, they probably don't make them
where you come from.

35:17.409 --> 35:20.537
If they don't make them
where I come from, no one wants them.

35:21.286 --> 35:23.455
He'll track south.

35:23.623 --> 35:26.041
There's a highway here.

35:27.335 --> 35:31.088
There. Right there.
We wait, we poach them.

35:33.048 --> 35:36.344
- He could go east.
- He's burnt that tinder.

35:36.510 --> 35:39.096
He won't go sifting
through his own ashes.

35:39.264 --> 35:41.016
He could go southwest.

35:41.181 --> 35:43.100
South.

35:44.143 --> 35:45.185
It's your money.

35:52.943 --> 35:54.737
You see these stones?

35:54.903 --> 35:58.867
Well, in spring,
these shadows line up to the east.

35:59.034 --> 36:02.119
So that's how the ancient people
who build this...

36:02.286 --> 36:04.663
...they knew when to plant crops.

36:04.831 --> 36:09.169
And then the Spanish people came,
and they didn't understand anything.

36:09.335 --> 36:11.962
I mean, this place is beautiful, right?

36:12.130 --> 36:14.382
But they thought it was an evil place.

36:14.548 --> 36:17.177
And they called it the "Infiernito,"
the little hell.

36:17.344 --> 36:19.304
Sounds about right.

36:19.846 --> 36:22.139
My grandmother was one
of those people.

36:22.306 --> 36:26.018
And their hero,
he was kind and sober, not like you.

36:26.186 --> 36:28.188
Should have taught them
to be less judgy.

36:28.355 --> 36:29.981
You have any idea...

36:30.148 --> 36:33.068
...how advanced and noble
these people were?

36:33.233 --> 36:37.614
They used to cut out their enemies' hearts
and sacrifice them to the sun.

36:37.780 --> 36:39.699
Sometimes revenge is noble.

36:39.865 --> 36:43.369
You see, that's...
That's your problem right there.

36:43.536 --> 36:46.914
- What?
- People see themselves as...

36:47.081 --> 36:51.627
...the one holding the heart,
not the one with a hole in their chest.

36:52.420 --> 36:54.505
Fuck it, car's fixed.

36:55.422 --> 36:57.257
Next town, then.

38:56.503 --> 38:58.338
I love this song.

39:05.887 --> 39:08.306
They start playing it too soon, you know?

39:08.472 --> 39:10.557
It's weird. It's a Christmas song.

39:10.724 --> 39:12.059
You like Christmas?

39:13.811 --> 39:15.063
Not very. No.

39:15.230 --> 39:16.523
Why? You should.

39:16.690 --> 39:18.650
I mean, I love Christmas.

39:18.817 --> 39:21.485
I would like to see it snow on Christmas.

39:21.652 --> 39:24.988
Because here in this country,
it never snow.

39:25.155 --> 39:29.326
Never in the hills, never in the desert,
never in the town.

39:30.954 --> 39:33.832
- I was born near here, you know?
- Oh, yeah?

39:34.289 --> 39:35.791
You see that?

39:35.958 --> 39:38.252
That used to be beautiful.

39:39.295 --> 39:40.338
Yeah.

39:42.965 --> 39:44.717
So...

39:44.884 --> 39:47.094
...do you even believe in him?

39:47.262 --> 39:48.972
- Who?
- God.

39:50.222 --> 39:52.016
Not in the slightest, no.

39:53.268 --> 39:57.021
- You're pretty troubled, right?
- Very troubled, yeah.

39:57.188 --> 39:59.441
I'm not. I'm strong.

39:59.606 --> 40:03.777
Yeah, well, it takes a strong man
to live with all my weaknesses.

40:03.945 --> 40:06.448
That's why you became a padre.

40:06.614 --> 40:08.699
To find a strength.

40:11.994 --> 40:14.873
I know you're not a real padre...

40:15.039 --> 40:17.708
...because I saw your wedding ring.

40:18.208 --> 40:19.668
Hey.

40:20.795 --> 40:22.797
That's off-limits.

40:22.963 --> 40:24.382
All right?

40:36.603 --> 40:38.271
Hey, Gaspar.

40:39.146 --> 40:41.523
Do you know
what happened to his face?

40:43.443 --> 40:45.570
I don't want to know.

40:45.778 --> 40:49.114
But another week with him,
I'll break his face.

40:49.699 --> 40:52.869
When we get to the city,
I'm done with him.

40:54.119 --> 40:55.704
You're going south?

40:56.081 --> 40:58.208
Do me a favor.

40:58.375 --> 41:02.795
Drop him off at the station
in MachetÃ¡ for me?

41:04.172 --> 41:08.092
Parcero, if it were just me,
of course, but him....

41:08.300 --> 41:10.344
It's only an hour out of your way.

41:10.512 --> 41:13.640
For me, it's a whole day of work.

41:24.567 --> 41:28.278
What the fuck are you doing?
We're not going there.

41:28.655 --> 41:30.156
He is.

41:30.322 --> 41:32.533
They're eager for him in MachetÃ¡.

41:32.701 --> 41:35.369
Look, he broke
a policeman's hand there.

41:35.536 --> 41:38.247
So he'll do some years
if he even gets to jail.

41:38.414 --> 41:40.041
He won't make it.

41:40.208 --> 41:44.503
They'll break every bone in his body
before he sees a judge.

41:44.670 --> 41:47.339
Oh, come on, Your Honor,
he broke the law.

41:47.507 --> 41:48.925
The law, huh?

41:49.092 --> 41:53.346
The law is clay. It can be bent.

41:53.847 --> 41:57.182
That boy needs justice, not law.

41:57.349 --> 41:59.351
Justice is rock.

41:59.518 --> 42:02.438
Try bending rock.

42:31.509 --> 42:33.094
Come on.

42:35.179 --> 42:36.638
It's all right.

42:36.806 --> 42:40.268
Yeah, come on back.
Yeah, take a break.

42:40.434 --> 42:42.436
Put your hands here. Yeah?

42:42.603 --> 42:44.480
Right. Bend over. All right.

42:44.646 --> 42:47.900
Spread them. Okay. Spread them.

42:48.068 --> 42:51.071
Don't buck. Don't move.

43:06.585 --> 43:07.878
What...? What the...?

43:10.090 --> 43:11.257
You let him go?

43:11.423 --> 43:13.050
Justice is a rock.

43:14.010 --> 43:16.388
We're not going to MachetÃ¡.

43:28.900 --> 43:30.068
This pool is something!

43:32.862 --> 43:34.530
Yeah. It's shitty.

43:36.532 --> 43:39.034
I can't believe
I have to stay in this dump.

43:42.664 --> 43:44.416
Yeah. It's shit.

43:58.847 --> 44:00.265
We should steal your reward.

44:03.268 --> 44:05.353
That is a fucking crazy idea.

44:05.519 --> 44:10.650
No, the crazy thing's
someone thinks you're worth $5000.

44:13.360 --> 44:15.529
- Where are you going?
- The bar.

44:15.697 --> 44:18.032
Get me something orange.

45:05.121 --> 45:06.831
Hey, hey.

45:08.458 --> 45:11.336
You were right. South.

45:13.170 --> 45:15.047
Just keep driving.

45:27.893 --> 45:30.729
You want me
to send up some Popsicles?

45:32.148 --> 45:33.692
No.

45:33.858 --> 45:36.820
Paletas, that's what we say.

45:36.985 --> 45:40.572
You only find them in this area.
They're really, really good.

45:40.739 --> 45:43.283
Let me see
if they got your flavor. Hold on.

45:43.702 --> 45:47.706
Let's see, coconut, lime, chocolate.

45:48.664 --> 45:51.418
Oh, I'm so sorry, no plain.

45:54.461 --> 45:57.465
Okay, there's movement
on the second floor.

45:57.632 --> 45:58.925
Should we go in?

45:59.092 --> 46:01.427
No. Wait.

46:01.594 --> 46:03.554
He's armed.

46:05.389 --> 46:08.225
The girl, the girl, the girl. Go, go.

46:43.344 --> 46:45.096
It's okay, keep the change.

46:56.523 --> 46:58.817
- They're here.
- Oh, for fuck's sake.

46:58.985 --> 47:00.362
Across the street.

47:07.534 --> 47:10.746
- Second window to the left.
- Go. Go.

47:18.838 --> 47:19.923
Throw me the keys.

47:28.722 --> 47:32.226
- Is he armed?
- No. He's taking a shower.

48:07.052 --> 48:08.471
Go, go, go!

48:08.637 --> 48:11.056
This is the second time
I saved your ass.

48:11.224 --> 48:13.018
Out the balcony!

48:14.936 --> 48:16.229
Goddamn it.

48:17.646 --> 48:19.773
Hey, hey! This isn't Texas!

48:22.068 --> 48:24.903
- What are you doing?!
- You could have killed her!

48:25.070 --> 48:28.657
You could have killed her
by grabbing the gun!

48:28.824 --> 48:31.618
- What's wrong with you?!
- What's wrong with you?

48:31.786 --> 48:35.664
- I'm going out.
- We can't leave. It's a shooting.

48:35.831 --> 48:40.170
The police are on their way.
You think the law doesn't apply to you?

48:40.336 --> 48:42.380
No. Okay? What are you doing, huh?

48:42.547 --> 48:45.132
What are you doing,
you fucking asshole?

48:46.050 --> 48:48.761
Just square it fast.

48:50.512 --> 48:52.181
Shit!

50:02.835 --> 50:04.378
SeÃ±or.

50:09.967 --> 50:13.971
You don't know how much dancing
I had to do, and I love to dance.

50:14.514 --> 50:17.142
- Let's go.
- No, no, no.

50:17.307 --> 50:20.353
I'm driving you to the city. That's it.

50:20.519 --> 50:24.481
Go talk to a friend of mine,
he's going to help you out.

50:24.940 --> 50:29.194
If you're trying to get a higher rate,
that tap is shut.

50:30.487 --> 50:32.364
The rate is fine. It's you.

50:33.907 --> 50:36.994
Look, I don't know
why you wanna find this padre...

50:37.161 --> 50:39.163
...or what you'll do when you find him.

50:39.329 --> 50:42.666
But if you don't tell me
what's going on, I'm done.

50:47.797 --> 50:50.592
Look, I'm a U.S. marshal.

50:50.759 --> 50:53.052
Retired a few years.

50:53.719 --> 50:56.972
My wife, she died a while back.

50:57.139 --> 50:59.893
Now, my daughter...

51:05.356 --> 51:08.275
...she was everything to me.

51:11.945 --> 51:15.699
But as she grew up,
we grew very far apart.

51:15.867 --> 51:17.786
That's on me.

51:18.327 --> 51:20.913
I pushed her too far.

51:22.498 --> 51:25.334
One day, I get a call.

51:25.501 --> 51:29.463
She's getting married
to a man I never met.

51:31.257 --> 51:34.635
So I run a background check
on the guy.

51:36.304 --> 51:39.557
You can probably guess who that was.

51:40.557 --> 51:43.478
Ex-military, discharged.

51:43.644 --> 51:46.230
Addictions, fraud.

51:48.858 --> 51:52.237
Needless to say, I do not approve.

51:52.903 --> 51:56.074
We drifted further apart.

51:58.409 --> 52:00.077
Then a year goes by...

52:01.161 --> 52:04.331
...I get a visit from the police.

52:05.541 --> 52:07.460
She's dead.

52:07.626 --> 52:10.672
Because of him, she's dead.

52:29.023 --> 52:31.775
And I don't handle it well.

52:33.570 --> 52:35.238
Cops don't charge him.

52:35.405 --> 52:39.617
They can't. But he still runs away.

52:41.619 --> 52:45.457
When the funeral was over,
I started hunting him.

52:45.914 --> 52:49.043
Gonna make him a special project.

52:50.128 --> 52:53.590
I'm gonna learn everything
about him now, and when I do...

52:53.757 --> 52:56.509
...if justice means anything...

52:56.675 --> 52:59.219
...this man should know it.

53:00.554 --> 53:05.018
Okay, okay. So you have
a legitimate grievance, okay?

53:05.184 --> 53:08.688
But it's in your power
not to shoot a girl.

53:11.231 --> 53:13.692
I have no power.

53:13.860 --> 53:15.653
He needs to pay.

53:15.820 --> 53:18.030
Then I die happy.

53:19.324 --> 53:21.284
I'm bound to him.

53:22.117 --> 53:26.581
I lashed my fate to a spear
and I aimed it at his heart.

53:32.420 --> 53:34.755
I know it will soon end.

53:35.632 --> 53:40.260
And I see
a terrible emptiness approaching.

53:48.644 --> 53:51.105
But I don't wanna hurt the girl.

54:05.869 --> 54:09.790
Here. Bus leaves in three hours,
that's what's left.

54:10.458 --> 54:14.295
All right? You got a ticket
and a hundred pesos.

54:16.338 --> 54:18.382
We had a deal.

54:20.300 --> 54:22.846
You had a bankroll. Now, on you go.

54:23.012 --> 54:25.264
- No.
- All right. Fuck it.

54:25.431 --> 54:27.016
- No, please.
- Car's dead anyway.

54:27.182 --> 54:30.311
No, please.
Please, you can't do this to me.

54:30.478 --> 54:32.563
- You have to help me!
- Go home!

54:32.731 --> 54:37.819
What home? They stole my sister.
They stole everything. Please, help me.

54:37.985 --> 54:40.195
- No. No.
- Please stay.

54:40.362 --> 54:41.905
No!

54:42.407 --> 54:44.534
Please.

56:00.068 --> 56:01.403
Help me!

56:01.568 --> 56:02.778
You have to help me!

56:03.195 --> 56:04.447
Please!

56:05.407 --> 56:06.408
Wake up!

56:07.951 --> 56:09.661
Help me!

57:08.844 --> 57:09.971
Hey.

57:11.181 --> 57:13.724
I found this gold watch.

57:17.561 --> 57:19.772
Let's go steal my reward.

57:19.938 --> 57:23.233
We're gonna need a lot more money
if this is gonna work.

57:35.579 --> 57:37.248
This'll work.

57:43.545 --> 57:47.174
- This one or this one?
- Whichever's cheapest.

57:47.342 --> 57:50.302
- Are we paying for it?
- Just stick to the script.

57:54.891 --> 57:57.434
- Hey, I was wrong.
- What?

57:57.601 --> 57:59.436
We do have snow here.

58:01.563 --> 58:02.773
Just make the call.

58:08.987 --> 58:10.030
Hey.

58:10.739 --> 58:12.449
This is Lena. I have a deal for you.

58:13.534 --> 58:14.743
So this is the plan:

58:15.369 --> 58:18.998
Only deal with the Colombian cop.
Stay outside. Talk through the window.

58:19.164 --> 58:22.418
If the old man tries to talk to you,
get out. He's dangerous.

58:22.585 --> 58:24.045
Okay.

58:25.755 --> 58:27.173
Oi.

58:27.340 --> 58:28.883
Here.

58:31.427 --> 58:33.304
- If anything goes wrong...
- It won't.

58:33.471 --> 58:36.724
Yeah, but if it does,
we meet there. All right?

58:38.143 --> 58:42.688
- It would be easier with a gun.
- No. Faster, maybe, but not easier.

58:42.856 --> 58:44.691
No guns. Stick to the script.

58:44.858 --> 58:46.526
- And don't get cocky.
- Okay.

58:46.693 --> 58:50.280
But my way is easier
and faster and better.

58:51.864 --> 58:53.949
Oh, for fuck's sake.

58:58.246 --> 59:00.331
What the fuck is she doing?

59:05.961 --> 59:08.590
Anything you want to tell us
before we get started?

59:09.548 --> 59:11.967
He stole my uncle's rifle.

59:13.594 --> 59:17.723
He says he has to kill you,
or you will never stop.

59:18.891 --> 59:21.685
He's different now. I'm afraid of him.

59:24.146 --> 59:26.315
I don't believe that.

59:26.483 --> 59:28.985
What the fuck is wrong with you?

59:29.152 --> 59:30.653
Search her.

59:30.820 --> 59:32.947
- Okay, let's go. Come on.
- No!

59:33.114 --> 59:34.782
Fuck.

59:35.240 --> 59:36.701
Fuck's sake.

59:39.119 --> 59:41.038
We're okay.

59:48.588 --> 59:51.966
Little girl, you listen to me.

59:52.132 --> 59:54.343
I'm not here to fuck around.

59:54.510 --> 59:58.139
I'm gonna ask you questions.
You better tell me the truth.

59:58.306 --> 01:00:00.391
If you don't, people will get hurt.

01:00:04.771 --> 01:00:08.108
Everything rides on what you say next.

01:00:11.027 --> 01:00:15.030
Tell me, why are you doing this?

01:00:19.536 --> 01:00:21.162
He stole my uncle's car.

01:00:21.329 --> 01:00:24.249
You keep that up,
I'm gonna slap you silly, girl.

01:00:26.543 --> 01:00:28.169
- Come on.
- I hate him.

01:00:28.335 --> 01:00:32.214
Goddamn it, you tell me now.
You tell me!

01:00:36.052 --> 01:00:37.971
I need the money.

01:00:44.936 --> 01:00:47.814
So can I have it?

01:00:47.981 --> 01:00:50.984
- He's right there.
- All right, then, my turn.

01:00:55.864 --> 01:00:59.951
It's just one room and one way out.

01:01:00.117 --> 01:01:01.411
Give me the money...

01:01:01.577 --> 01:01:04.788
...I can make him forget that rifle
for a while.

01:01:13.047 --> 01:01:14.590
No.

01:01:17.427 --> 01:01:18.635
Lock her in the car.

01:01:21.597 --> 01:01:23.516
Take a position at the window.

01:01:23.682 --> 01:01:27.061
- No! No!
- No one in, no one out.

01:01:27.896 --> 01:01:29.064
I'll go up alone.

01:01:30.731 --> 01:01:33.067
Cocky, little fucking....

01:01:33.400 --> 01:01:35.569
Arrogant fuck.

01:01:36.362 --> 01:01:37.780
Fuck it.

01:02:47.016 --> 01:02:48.893
You see him?

01:02:49.601 --> 01:02:51.645
Nope, nada.

01:02:51.813 --> 01:02:54.858
- Search the building.
- On my way.

01:02:59.195 --> 01:03:00.655
Fuck's sake.

01:03:06.327 --> 01:03:09.205
What a total idiot.
Stick to the fucking script.

01:03:15.461 --> 01:03:18.965
- I don't know. I thought we had him.
- I know.

01:03:31.311 --> 01:03:32.896
I'll be....

01:03:34.563 --> 01:03:38.442
This guy... This guy is pretty good,
your padre, you know?

01:03:42.322 --> 01:03:44.657
Go look after the girl.

01:03:51.998 --> 01:03:53.458
Shit.

01:03:56.710 --> 01:03:58.420
I know this.

01:04:00.047 --> 01:04:02.132
When a politician goes on the TV...

01:04:02.300 --> 01:04:05.303
...he says, "With all due respect,"
you know what that means?

01:04:05.469 --> 01:04:08.639
Know what that means?
That means a total lack of respect.

01:04:08.806 --> 01:04:11.183
That's what.
That's what you displayed to me.

01:04:11.351 --> 01:04:13.894
Total fucking lack of respect!

01:04:14.061 --> 01:04:17.272
I told you to stick to the script. Right?

01:04:17.440 --> 01:04:19.733
I mean, have you learned nothing?

01:04:27.492 --> 01:04:29.077
Right.

01:06:08.134 --> 01:06:09.177
Let's go.

01:06:09.344 --> 01:06:12.097
Let's go. Let's go!

01:06:15.224 --> 01:06:17.851
Okay, this is it.
Try not to be a dick, okay?

01:06:18.018 --> 01:06:19.436
Keep a low profile.

01:06:30.699 --> 01:06:32.659
This is obviously the main hall.

01:06:32.826 --> 01:06:36.954
You see that, up on the ceiling,
we have various....

01:07:00.478 --> 01:07:02.063
Up there.

01:07:18.329 --> 01:07:20.039
Where did you get this?

01:07:20.206 --> 01:07:21.332
Heaven.

01:07:55.199 --> 01:07:56.451
I like this one.

01:07:56.617 --> 01:07:58.369
It's too heavy.

01:08:00.204 --> 01:08:02.081
This one. Cheaper.

01:08:02.248 --> 01:08:04.458
You never let me have nice things.

01:08:05.001 --> 01:08:07.629
- You sure you wanna do this?
- Yes.

01:08:12.342 --> 01:08:13.885
All right.

01:08:15.135 --> 01:08:17.470
- Can you hear me?
- Kind of.

01:08:18.846 --> 01:08:21.475
- See that?
- Kind of.

01:08:21.643 --> 01:08:23.645
- Can you breathe?
- Kind of?

01:08:24.688 --> 01:08:25.895
Not good answers.

01:08:32.319 --> 01:08:33.444
There you go.

01:08:33.613 --> 01:08:36.240
Man, I look like an ugly dead boy.

01:08:41.662 --> 01:08:44.163
- You all right?
- Kind of.

01:09:06.354 --> 01:09:09.064
How can I help you, Padre?

01:09:14.154 --> 01:09:17.866
It's from the diocese of Saint Anna,
about a girl that passed.

01:09:18.908 --> 01:09:22.828
- You weren't expecting me, were you?
- No, no, Father. No.

01:09:24.287 --> 01:09:25.997
No.

01:09:27.457 --> 01:09:31.002
- Okay.
- Service was supposed to be tomorrow.

01:09:38.636 --> 01:09:41.680
My Lord. So young.

01:09:42.221 --> 01:09:45.725
Yeah. She barely lived at all, mate.

01:09:45.894 --> 01:09:48.354
- It's tragic.
- Yeah.

01:09:51.024 --> 01:09:52.609
Well...

01:09:53.902 --> 01:09:57.154
...can't just leave her in the van, can we?

01:09:57.654 --> 01:10:00.492
- No, no. Of course, no.
- What do you think?

01:10:01.701 --> 01:10:04.328
Go to the basement.

01:10:05.246 --> 01:10:07.582
Place for you in heaven, mate.

01:10:08.792 --> 01:10:10.126
Got that?

01:10:15.965 --> 01:10:17.425
Lena?

01:10:18.342 --> 01:10:19.760
Yes.

01:10:21.762 --> 01:10:23.180
You okay? You all right?

01:10:24.640 --> 01:10:26.643
What if something goes wrong?

01:10:26.810 --> 01:10:29.896
- Nothing's gonna go wrong, love.
- But if it does?

01:10:30.063 --> 01:10:31.523
It won't.

01:10:33.358 --> 01:10:35.025
Is he gone?

01:10:35.193 --> 01:10:36.235
No.

01:10:38.988 --> 01:10:41.032
Has he been around?

01:10:41.198 --> 01:10:43.367
No, I don't think so.

01:10:46.746 --> 01:10:48.789
How you doing? You all right?

01:10:49.332 --> 01:10:50.458
Scared.

01:10:50.625 --> 01:10:53.545
- Okay, I'm coming in to get you. All right?
- No.

01:10:53.712 --> 01:10:55.797
I'll kill you if you do that, okay?

01:10:55.963 --> 01:10:57.506
Just talk to me.

01:10:57.673 --> 01:10:59.801
Tell me something.

01:11:04.596 --> 01:11:06.849
Tell me about your wedding ring.

01:11:19.863 --> 01:11:21.740
Okay, so...

01:11:22.114 --> 01:11:24.033
...imagine a man...

01:11:24.199 --> 01:11:26.661
...that used to be a bit of an asshole.

01:11:26.828 --> 01:11:28.663
"Used to be"?

01:11:29.163 --> 01:11:32.291
Yeah, probably
the most selfish asshole ever.

01:11:33.083 --> 01:11:36.796
But then he meets a woman...

01:11:36.962 --> 01:11:39.631
...and it's like...

01:11:40.382 --> 01:11:43.260
...a "let there be light" type of thing.
You know?

01:11:43.427 --> 01:11:46.180
She sees something in him,
which, naturally...

01:11:46.347 --> 01:11:51.101
...makes him question her sanity,
but everyone has their flaws, right?

01:11:54.271 --> 01:11:55.481
So they get married.

01:11:55.981 --> 01:11:58.734
And then they move north...

01:11:58.902 --> 01:12:00.819
...to her home...

01:12:00.987 --> 01:12:03.864
...a little piece of nothing
in the middle of nowhere.

01:12:05.867 --> 01:12:09.119
And the asshole...

01:12:09.287 --> 01:12:12.624
...starts to think
that he's becoming less of an asshole.

01:12:19.381 --> 01:12:23.343
He gets a proper job.
And he even gets one of those dish sets.

01:12:23.510 --> 01:12:28.014
You know, one of those ones where
all the cups and saucers match in it.

01:12:32.394 --> 01:12:35.355
So there he is,
he's in the middle of nowhere...

01:12:35.521 --> 01:12:40.025
...right, with a woman that he loves
who's every bit his better.

01:12:40.193 --> 01:12:41.528
And he's happy.

01:12:48.576 --> 01:12:50.286
So...

01:12:50.953 --> 01:12:55.166
...time passes
and she becomes pregnant.

01:12:56.292 --> 01:12:58.920
And that's when he starts
to have his doubts.

01:12:59.671 --> 01:13:02.007
Six weeks before she's due
to have the baby...

01:13:03.882 --> 01:13:05.135
...he takes a drink.

01:13:05.301 --> 01:13:08.263
There's no good reason for it,
he just does.

01:13:08.430 --> 01:13:11.682
And he does it... He drinks a lot.

01:13:14.019 --> 01:13:17.689
And she goes into labor.

01:13:19.649 --> 01:13:22.235
She tries to wake him up, apparently.

01:13:23.737 --> 01:13:27.865
But she's an hour
from the nearest hospital...

01:13:29.074 --> 01:13:32.953
...in the middle of fucking nowhere,
and she's in breech.

01:13:34.581 --> 01:13:37.208
The baby's upside down, you know?

01:13:39.085 --> 01:13:40.795
I lost them both.

01:13:51.264 --> 01:13:53.850
And I've been running ever since.

01:13:56.810 --> 01:13:58.313
I'm sorry.

01:14:17.791 --> 01:14:19.626
All right, he's gone.

01:15:08.173 --> 01:15:10.510
Hey, Padre, take this.

01:15:10.676 --> 01:15:13.345
Oh, yeah.
All right, we'll put it in here. Go.

01:15:24.940 --> 01:15:27.234
It's a bit tacky, isn't it?

01:15:29.237 --> 01:15:31.197
What do we do?
Chuck a brick through it?

01:15:31.363 --> 01:15:33.323
No. Wait here.

01:15:33.490 --> 01:15:35.452
I used to live here.

01:15:47.796 --> 01:15:51.467
You put the shit in the truck.
Meet you at the quarry.

01:15:51.634 --> 01:15:53.595
We'll ditch the van there.

01:15:58.891 --> 01:16:00.143
We did it, Padre.

01:16:02.311 --> 01:16:03.979
Thank you so much.

01:16:41.725 --> 01:16:44.353
I had to have a talk with my daughter.

01:16:44.520 --> 01:16:47.231
She was seeing
this boy her mother didn't like.

01:16:47.399 --> 01:16:51.695
I had to tell my daughter,
"Hey, if your mother doesn't like the boy...

01:16:51.860 --> 01:16:53.195
...you can't see the boy."

01:16:53.363 --> 01:16:55.615
So my daughter says,
"How'd you meet Mom?"

01:16:55.782 --> 01:17:00.119
I said, "That's easy.
I met your mom on the dance floor."

01:17:31.484 --> 01:17:33.486
He must have left her.

01:17:36.905 --> 01:17:38.574
Where are you?

01:17:46.707 --> 01:17:48.292
Please answer me.

01:17:49.210 --> 01:17:50.795
He's here.

01:17:51.212 --> 01:17:54.382
He is here within range.

01:17:56.301 --> 01:17:59.095
I can wait here all night.

01:18:07.770 --> 01:18:10.814
- I'm not coming.
- Where are you?

01:18:10.981 --> 01:18:13.859
- I'm not coming.
- You're already here.

01:18:14.735 --> 01:18:17.322
Just to see you got away safe.

01:18:18.238 --> 01:18:20.115
Don't be stupid. We need to go.

01:18:22.827 --> 01:18:24.871
I'm done running.

01:18:26.331 --> 01:18:27.707
You sell the cup.

01:18:27.873 --> 01:18:29.458
Go find your sister.

01:18:29.626 --> 01:18:32.087
I'm not leaving without you.

01:18:33.128 --> 01:18:34.255
We take her now.

01:18:46.725 --> 01:18:48.394
Oh, no. No. No.

01:18:53.315 --> 01:18:55.359
Please, girl. Don't make this so hard.

01:18:55.527 --> 01:18:57.487
- Out.
- No, no, no.

01:18:57.654 --> 01:18:59.989
- Get out. Get out.
- No, no, no.

01:19:02.617 --> 01:19:03.827
Give me that walkie.

01:19:16.338 --> 01:19:18.466
Are you listening?

01:19:21.720 --> 01:19:23.179
No.

01:19:23.555 --> 01:19:26.432
No. Are you watching?

01:19:28.059 --> 01:19:29.936
Yes.

01:19:30.103 --> 01:19:34.690
Then you know I have her.

01:19:35.065 --> 01:19:38.862
This girl, she means something to you.

01:19:39.029 --> 01:19:41.698
You took something from me.

01:19:41.864 --> 01:19:45.784
Maybe I should take something
from you.

01:19:46.453 --> 01:19:51.583
- Maybe... Maybe she resisted.
- Are you crazy? What are you doing?

01:19:53.542 --> 01:19:56.962
Maybe she goes for my gun.

01:19:57.130 --> 01:19:59.841
What the fuck is wrong with you, dude?

01:20:00.007 --> 01:20:02.301
But I'm un-holstered.

01:20:04.304 --> 01:20:06.221
And I'm well-trained.

01:20:08.015 --> 01:20:11.018
So if you are watching...

01:20:13.729 --> 01:20:16.732
...you'll know what happens next.

01:20:18.193 --> 01:20:21.029
Come on, come on, come on!
Come on, get down.

01:20:21.195 --> 01:20:22.279
Get down, get down!

01:20:29.746 --> 01:20:31.413
Get down, girl!

01:20:36.293 --> 01:20:39.421
Nemes, I told you not to do this!

01:20:39.588 --> 01:20:41.256
You're on your own, idiot!

01:20:57.273 --> 01:20:59.525
Padre, don't shoot!

01:21:02.194 --> 01:21:03.237
Fuck.

01:21:04.948 --> 01:21:06.574
No. No.

01:21:06.740 --> 01:21:08.368
No!

01:21:11.371 --> 01:21:13.456
NiÃ±a, niÃ±a!

01:21:13.957 --> 01:21:15.333
Wake up!

01:21:15.582 --> 01:21:17.126
Wake up!

01:21:52.037 --> 01:21:55.289
I hit you square, I know.

01:21:59.711 --> 01:22:01.921
Do you taste it?

01:22:03.088 --> 01:22:05.759
Like sour acid.

01:22:05.925 --> 01:22:08.552
Cherries in the spring...

01:22:08.720 --> 01:22:10.930
...but copper-like.

01:22:13.600 --> 01:22:15.226
Maybe.

01:22:15.810 --> 01:22:17.854
You're dying.

01:22:19.564 --> 01:22:22.067
- Is she okay?
- She'll live.

01:22:23.318 --> 01:22:25.028
Let her go.

01:22:29.239 --> 01:22:31.658
Boy, you're a cocky one.

01:22:32.868 --> 01:22:35.871
I don't think you got that hand.

01:22:42.087 --> 01:22:43.129
Shit.

01:22:48.426 --> 01:22:51.513
You come out for that gun, I'll kill you.

01:22:55.057 --> 01:22:57.268
Lena, wake up.

01:23:03.649 --> 01:23:05.275
You know...

01:23:05.443 --> 01:23:07.570
...I loved your daughter.

01:23:10.155 --> 01:23:12.533
You're responsible.

01:23:12.701 --> 01:23:14.284
Yeah, I know.

01:23:14.452 --> 01:23:15.994
I'm sorry.

01:23:17.872 --> 01:23:21.710
And there's nothing you can do
to make it right.

01:23:21.876 --> 01:23:25.046
Let Lena go, and you can have me.

01:23:26.463 --> 01:23:30.051
No, we're past all that.

01:23:30.217 --> 01:23:32.554
No more games.

01:23:32.720 --> 01:23:37.182
My fate is a spear aimed at your heart.

01:23:38.935 --> 01:23:41.062
Please don't do this.

01:23:43.605 --> 01:23:47.318
I'm getting my gun. It ends here.

01:23:48.278 --> 01:23:50.613
I said I'd kill you.

01:23:50.779 --> 01:23:52.282
We're already dead.

01:24:46.752 --> 01:24:48.587
Put her in the car.

01:24:50.297 --> 01:24:51.925
It's between you and him.

01:24:58.640 --> 01:25:00.767
You got six hours.

01:25:00.934 --> 01:25:02.435
Where's the nearest hospital?

01:25:02.601 --> 01:25:05.771
She doesn't need a hospital,
and you don't got time. Six hours.

01:25:11.319 --> 01:25:14.406
Get the girl out of the country.
After that, she's a fugitive.

01:25:14.572 --> 01:25:16.365
There's a warrant for you.

01:25:16.533 --> 01:25:20.036
Just rest, love. Just rest, love.

01:27:34.628 --> 01:27:36.256
Padre?

01:27:39.259 --> 01:27:40.844
Padre?

01:27:45.431 --> 01:27:46.932
Padre?

01:27:47.600 --> 01:27:49.227
Padre?

01:29:23.779 --> 01:29:24.822
It's snowing.
