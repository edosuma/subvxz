WEBVTT

00:06.137 --> 00:08.509
( engine revving,
tires screeching )

00:08.509 --> 00:11.612
OHH! THIS NEW NEIGHBOR
HAS GOT TO GO!

00:11.612 --> 00:15.146
WHY DOES HE KEEP RACING HIS CAR
UP AND DOWN OUR STREET
EVERY NIGHT?

00:15.146 --> 00:19.220
OOH! I KNOW THIS ONE!
TO GET TO THE OTHER SIDE.

00:19.220 --> 00:21.592
( engine revving,
tires screech )

00:21.592 --> 00:24.225
HE CLEARLY HAS NO RESPECT
FOR MY BEAUTY SLEEP.

00:24.225 --> 00:26.527
IT TAKES AT LEAST EIGHT HOURS
TO LOOK THIS GOOD.

00:26.527 --> 00:28.699
TEN, IF YOU WANT
THAT LEO GLOW.

00:30.431 --> 00:33.264
I CANNOT BELIEVE
I HAVE TO WAKE UP TO THIS.

00:33.264 --> 00:36.237
I CAN'T BELIEVE I HAVE TO
WAKE UP TO THAT.

00:36.237 --> 00:38.069
THIS IS ITALIAN SILK.

00:38.069 --> 00:39.770
A CHEETAH WISHES
 HE LOOKED THIS GOOD.

00:39.770 --> 00:43.244
A CHEETAH WOULD HAVE
THE DECENCY TO COVER
THAT UP WITH A ROBE.

00:43.244 --> 00:46.717
( revving, tires screech )

00:46.717 --> 00:50.251
HEY, PIERCE!
GET YOUR CAR OFF MY LAWN!

00:50.251 --> 00:53.654
LET'S SEE HOW HE LIKES MY NEW
HIGH-PRESSURE SPRINKLER SYSTEM.

00:55.586 --> 00:58.559
OKAY, SET TO "MONSOON."

00:58.559 --> 01:01.332
( sprinklers on )
 HA! HE'S STUCK IN THE MUD!

01:06.337 --> 01:08.169
NOT ANYMORE.

01:10.671 --> 01:13.704
THE WORLD'S FIRST
BIONIC SUPERHUMANS--

01:13.704 --> 01:15.606
THEY'RE STRONGER THAN US...

01:15.606 --> 01:17.748
FASTER, SMARTER.

01:17.748 --> 01:20.511
THE NEXT GENERATION
OF THE HUMAN RACE IS...

01:20.511 --> 01:22.713
LIVING IN MY BASEMENT?!

01:22.713 --> 01:25.686
♪♪

02:02.153 --> 02:05.626
LEO, HOW'D YOU GET TO BE
FIRST IN LINE FOR LOCKER
REASSIGNMENTS?

02:05.626 --> 02:07.528
OH. SINCE I COULDN'T
GET ANY SLEEP,

02:07.528 --> 02:09.160
I'VE BEEN HERE SINCE DAWN.

02:09.160 --> 02:12.163
FYI, YOU DO NOT WANT
TO SEE THE LUNCH LADIES
WITHOUT MAKEUP.

02:12.163 --> 02:14.905
WAIT. THEY WEAR MAKEUP?

02:16.237 --> 02:17.708
BUT SINCE I'M FIRST IN LINE,

02:17.708 --> 02:19.740
I'LL FINALLY GET
THE CORNER LOCKER.

02:19.740 --> 02:22.643
WAIT A SECOND.
I THOUGHT THIS WAS
THE LINE FOR LICE CHECK.

02:26.277 --> 02:29.180
THERE SHE IS: LOCKER 106.

02:29.180 --> 02:31.752
AWAY FROM THE TRAFFIC,
NEAR THE CHEERLEADERS,

02:31.752 --> 02:33.854
AND I CAN SEE PRINCIPAL PERRY
BEFORE ANYONE ELSE--

02:33.854 --> 02:36.187
AND A TWO-SECOND HEAD START
CAN SAVE A LIFE.

02:36.187 --> 02:37.358
HMM.

02:39.190 --> 02:41.292
LISTEN UP, WEASELS!

02:41.292 --> 02:42.493
IT'S LOCKER REASSIGNMENT DAY.

02:42.493 --> 02:44.195
WHY, YOU ASK?

02:44.195 --> 02:46.737
A LITTLE TRICK I LEARNED
FROM MY DAYS AS A PRISON GUARD.

02:46.737 --> 02:49.340
NEVER LET THE PERPS
GET COMFY!!!

02:49.340 --> 02:51.242
( laughing )

02:51.242 --> 02:55.346
ALSO, DRAG YOUR HANDS
THROUGH MASHED POTATOES
TO CHECK FOR WEAPONS.

02:55.346 --> 02:58.509
MMM! ENJOY YOUR LUNCH!

02:58.509 --> 03:01.252
ALL RIGHT, DOOLEY,
WHAT LOCKER DO YOU WANT?

03:01.252 --> 03:02.553
THE CORNER ONE.

03:02.553 --> 03:04.685
ALREADY TAKEN!

03:04.685 --> 03:06.257
WHAT? BY WHO?

03:06.257 --> 03:07.758
BY ME.

03:07.758 --> 03:10.291
CLAYTON HARRINGTON.

03:10.291 --> 03:13.794
WELL, CLAYTON HARRINGTON...

03:13.794 --> 03:16.297
I KNOW YOU'RE NEW HERE,
BUT I WAS FIRST IN LINE.

03:16.297 --> 03:19.199
OH, I KNOW. THAT'S WHY
I OFFERED PRINCIPAL PERRY

03:19.199 --> 03:21.702
AN ALL-EXPENSE-PAID TRIP
TO GO WHEREVER SHE WANTS.

03:21.702 --> 03:25.336
STATEN ISLAND CAT SHOW,
HERE I COME! RROWW!

03:26.477 --> 03:28.279
BUT THAT'S NOT FAIR.

03:28.279 --> 03:31.782
I KNOW. ISN'T INJUSTICE
INFURIATING?

03:34.945 --> 03:37.448
WHY DO YOU CARE SO MUCH ABOUT
GETTING THE CORNER LOCKER?

03:37.448 --> 03:40.821
OH, I DON'T. BUT I HATE LINES,
AND HARRINGTONS DON'T WAIT.

03:40.821 --> 03:44.455
WE LET OUR MONEY DO THE TALKING.
AND RIGHT NOW IT'S SAYING...

03:44.455 --> 03:47.558
(falsetto):
"YOU DON'T HAVE
AS MUCH AS I DO."

03:47.558 --> 03:49.800
HA HA HA HA HA HA!

03:49.800 --> 03:53.504
WELL, DOOLEY, THERE ARE
NO MORE LOCKERS LEFT.

03:53.504 --> 03:56.437
SO HERE'S A KEY
TO THE BOILER ROOM.

03:56.437 --> 03:58.369
JUST REMEMBER TO KNOCK FIRST.

03:58.369 --> 04:01.241
MY RELATIVES STAY THERE
WHEN THEY'RE IN TOWN.

04:05.416 --> 04:07.718
BIG D, I NEED AN ADVANCE
ON MY ALLOWANCE.

04:07.718 --> 04:10.381
SURE. WHAT DO YOU NEED?
 FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS.

04:10.381 --> 04:13.584
OKAY, SURE. WOULD YOU LIKE THAT
IN IMAGINARY TWENTIES

04:13.584 --> 04:16.357
OR IMAGINARY HUNDREDS?

04:17.988 --> 04:20.391
LOOK, IT'S A LONG STORY,

04:20.391 --> 04:22.433
BUT THERE'S THIS NEW RICH KID
AT SCHOOL

04:22.433 --> 04:24.795
WHO'S USING HIS MONEY
TO GET WHATEVER HE WANTS.

04:24.795 --> 04:27.898
THAT'S A SHORT STORY,
AND I DON'T SEE WHAT
THE PROBLEM IS.

04:27.898 --> 04:30.671
ANYWAY, I NEED A LOT OF MONEY
TO BEAT HIM AT HIS OWN GAME.

04:30.671 --> 04:33.504
SO WHAT ARE WE WORKING WITH?
GOLD? SILVER?

04:33.504 --> 04:35.446
YOU KNOW WHAT,
JUST GIVE ME YOUR PIN CODE.

04:35.446 --> 04:37.948
LEO, I'M NOT GIVING YOU
ANY MONEY.

04:37.948 --> 04:41.482
GETTING INTO A SILLY GAME
OF ONE-UPSMANSHIP WITH THIS GUY
WON'T SOLVE ANYTHING.

04:41.482 --> 04:44.455
IT WILL IF I UP HIM.

04:44.455 --> 04:45.786
LOOK, YOU'LL SEE
WHAT I MEAN TONIGHT.

04:45.786 --> 04:48.659
I INVITED OUR NEIGHBOR PIERCE
OVER TO RESOLVE THE ISSUE

04:48.659 --> 04:51.492
OF HIS LATE-NIGHT JOY RIDES
IN A MATURE FASHION.

04:51.492 --> 04:53.464
JUST WATCH AND LEARN.

04:53.464 --> 04:54.925
GREAT, A LIFE LESSON.

04:54.925 --> 04:56.697
THOSE ARE WORTH
WAY MORE THAN MONEY.

04:59.770 --> 05:01.972
( doorbell rings )
 OKAY, THAT'S PIERCE.

05:01.972 --> 05:05.506
NOW WATCH AS I HANDLE THIS
LIKE AN ADULT.

05:05.506 --> 05:08.479
OKAY, BUT WHAT DO YOU
WANT US TO DO WHEN
YOU START CRYING?

05:11.842 --> 05:14.485
CLAYTON?
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

05:14.485 --> 05:17.017
LOOKING GOOD
AND SMELLING GREAT.

05:18.389 --> 05:20.451
OH, MY DAD CAME
TO TALK TO YOUR DAD.

05:20.451 --> 05:23.394
WAIT. PIERCE
IS YOUR DAD?
 HMM.

05:23.394 --> 05:25.796
MAKES SENSE: RICH JERK,
RICH JERK'S SON.

05:27.758 --> 05:28.899
( sniffs )

05:28.899 --> 05:31.101
OH. HE DOES SMELL GOOD.

05:31.101 --> 05:34.064
HELLO? ISN'T ANYONE
GOING TO TAKE MY COAT?

05:34.064 --> 05:36.567
HECK YEAH, I'LL TAKE IT!

05:37.908 --> 05:39.339
( fabric tears )

05:41.942 --> 05:43.444
IT'S GOT A LOT OF GIVE.

05:48.379 --> 05:50.551
TWO COATS LIGHT WAX,
AND SHAMPOO THE CARPETS.

05:50.551 --> 05:53.884
AND DON'T TOUCH THE RADIO--
I'M AN EASY LISTENER.

05:55.556 --> 05:57.428
I'M NOT WASHING YOUR CAR.

05:57.428 --> 05:58.589
ME NEITHER.

05:58.589 --> 06:00.731
BUT MAY I TAKE YOUR COAT?

06:03.464 --> 06:05.736
CAN WE MOVE THIS ALONG?
I GOT GOLF IN THE A.M.,

06:05.736 --> 06:06.967
AND I LIKE TO SHOW UP EARLY

06:06.967 --> 06:09.069
TO SCREAM DURING
OTHER PEOPLE'S SWINGS.

06:09.069 --> 06:10.441
AAAH!

06:10.441 --> 06:12.002
DRIVES 'EM CRAZY.

06:12.002 --> 06:14.675
LOOK, I'LL GET
RIGHT TO THE POINT.

06:14.675 --> 06:17.408
YOU HAVE BEEN DRIVING YOUR CAR
ACROSS MY LAWN AT NIGHT,

06:17.408 --> 06:19.810
AND IT NEEDS TO STOP.
 NOT GONNA HAPPEN.

06:19.810 --> 06:22.553
BUT I WILL PAY YOU
 TO STOP TALKING.

06:22.553 --> 06:23.884
WHAT'S YOUR PRICE?

06:25.486 --> 06:28.519
ARE YOU TRYING
TO PAY ME OFF?
I'M A BILLIONAIRE.

06:28.519 --> 06:30.821
WOW. JUST A BILLIONAIRE.

06:30.821 --> 06:32.463
MUST BE ROUGH.

06:32.463 --> 06:35.466
WELL, IF YOU EVER NEED A LOAN,
YOU KNOW WHERE I LIVE.

06:35.466 --> 06:37.167
IT'S THE CASTLE AT
THE TOP OF THE HILL

06:37.167 --> 06:39.830
THAT CASTS A SHADOW OVER
YOUR ENTIRE EXISTENCE.

06:39.830 --> 06:41.031
WELL, PLEASE.

06:41.031 --> 06:44.404
YOU DO NOT HAVE
MORE MONEY THAN I DO.

06:44.404 --> 06:46.437
(sighs )
THAT'S MY NET WORTH.
 ( scoffs )

06:46.437 --> 06:49.840
WELL, NOT ALL THE ZEROES
FIT ON ONE SCREEN.

06:49.840 --> 06:51.442
( gulps )

06:51.442 --> 06:52.843
All: WHOA.

06:53.884 --> 06:55.846
(louder): WHOA!

06:57.718 --> 07:00.020
(louder): WHOA!!!

07:00.020 --> 07:03.854
OH, YEAH? WELL, I SEE ONE ZERO
THAT'S NOT ON THAT SCREEN.

07:03.854 --> 07:05.626
HA! TAKE THAT!

07:05.626 --> 07:08.659
SOMEONE'S ABOUT TO
START CRYING.

07:08.659 --> 07:11.632
LOOK, OKAY.
ENOUGH IS ENOUGH.

07:11.632 --> 07:15.536
WHAT IS IT GONNA TAKE
FOR YOU TO STOP
DRIVING ON MY LAWN?

07:15.536 --> 07:17.107
I CAN'T THINK OF A THING.
GOOD NIGHT.

07:17.107 --> 07:18.509
NO-- NO!

07:18.509 --> 07:21.772
YOU ARE NOT LEAVING
UNTIL WE RESOLVE THIS.

07:21.772 --> 07:25.175
FINE.
HOW ABOUT A CONTEST?

07:25.175 --> 07:27.978
WE COULD SETTLE THIS
ON THE RACETRACK.

07:27.978 --> 07:30.651
MY STOCK CAR
AGAINST YOURS.

07:30.651 --> 07:33.524
YOU DO OWN A STOCK CAR,
DON'T YOU?

07:33.524 --> 07:35.786
(forced laugh)
OF COURSE...

07:35.786 --> 07:38.489
I OWN A STOCK CAR.

07:38.489 --> 07:41.131
AND WHEN I WIN, YOU STOP
DRIVING YOUR CAR ON MY LAWN.

07:41.131 --> 07:43.834
OH, NO, NO, NO.
I THINK WE SHOULD PLAY
FOR MUCH BIGGER STAKES--

07:43.834 --> 07:46.537
LIKE THE DEEDS TO
EACH OTHER'S HOUSES.

07:47.968 --> 07:49.640
THE WINNER STAYS,

07:49.640 --> 07:51.672
THE LOSER...GOES.

07:52.703 --> 07:54.645
DEAL!

07:54.645 --> 07:56.807
SEE YOU ON THE TRACK.

07:56.807 --> 07:59.249
OR LATER TONIGHT WHEN I TEAR UP
THE REST OF YOUR LAWN. HEH HEH.

08:01.752 --> 08:03.914
MR. DAVENPORT,
ARE YOU SURE ABOUT THIS?

08:03.914 --> 08:06.587
YEAH, IF YOU DON'T WIN,
WE'LL LOSE OUR HOUSE.

08:06.587 --> 08:09.820
GUYS, I GOT THIS.
DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT.

08:09.820 --> 08:11.822
I JUST HAVE ONE QUESTION,
THOUGH.

08:11.822 --> 08:14.264
WHAT EXACTLY IS
A STOCK CAR?

08:14.264 --> 08:16.226
( all groan )

08:20.671 --> 08:22.903
SWEET RIDE, BIG D.

08:22.903 --> 08:26.076
FOR A SECOND THERE
I FORGOT YOU WEREN'T COOL.

08:26.076 --> 08:28.739
YEAH, A GUY WITH A HUGE EGO

08:28.739 --> 08:32.142
AND A SPORT WHERE THEY PUT
YOUR NAME AND FACE
ON EVERYTHING--

08:32.142 --> 08:34.244
IT'S A PERFECT MATCH.

08:35.785 --> 08:38.018
ARE YOU SURE YOU'RE GONNA
BE ABLE TO BEAT PIERCE?

08:38.018 --> 08:40.621
I MEAN, YOU HAVE
NO STOCK CAR EXPERIENCE,

08:40.621 --> 08:43.823
NOT TO MENTION YOU GET CAR SICK
GOING TO THE STORE.

08:45.095 --> 08:46.927
PLEASE. LOOK AT THIS TRACK.

08:46.927 --> 08:50.100
EVEN ADAM CAN DRIVE
IN A CIRCLE.

08:50.100 --> 08:53.263
BUT THIS IS AN OVAL,
AND THOSE TERRIFY ME.

08:53.263 --> 08:57.137
DRIVING IN A CIRCLE
GETS EXPONENTIALLY HARDER
AT 200 MILES PER HOUR.

08:57.137 --> 08:59.740
PLUS, NO BATHROOM BREAKS.

09:00.871 --> 09:03.273
YOU'RE GONNA NEED THIS.

09:03.273 --> 09:05.846
GUYS, DON'T WORRY
ABOUT THIS.

09:05.846 --> 09:09.580
I HAVE SPENT HUNDREDS OF HOURS
TRAINING IN A STOCK CAR
SIMULATOR,

09:09.580 --> 09:13.553
I HIRED THE BEST PIT CREW
IN TOWN... I GOT THIS.

09:13.553 --> 09:15.085
WELL, DAVENPORT,

09:15.085 --> 09:17.057
WE JUST WANTED TO
WISH YOU LUCK.

09:17.057 --> 09:19.630
YOU'LL NEED IT
AGAINST OUR DRIVER.

09:19.630 --> 09:22.062
( both chortling )
 DRIVER?

09:22.062 --> 09:25.095
YEAH. I SAID WE'D RACE;
I NEVER SAID I'D BE
THE ONE DRIVING.

09:25.095 --> 09:26.897
JOEY.

09:30.771 --> 09:32.743
THAT'S YOUR DRIVER?

09:32.743 --> 09:35.045
WHEN DOES HE GET
HIS LEARNER'S PERMIT?

09:37.577 --> 09:39.780
UH-OH. I'VE SEEN
THAT GUY BEFORE.

09:47.057 --> 09:49.119
THAT'S JOEY LOGANO.

09:49.119 --> 09:51.221
HE'S BEEN RACING
SINCE HE WAS SIX!

09:51.221 --> 09:54.294
HE'S THE YOUNGEST NASCAR DRIVER
TO WIN ON THE PRO CIRCUIT--

09:54.294 --> 09:56.126
EVER.

09:57.267 --> 10:00.130
OH.

10:00.130 --> 10:02.172
WE'RE GONNA NEED
A BIGGER BUCKET.

10:10.841 --> 10:12.282
(echo-y) HELLO!

10:12.282 --> 10:13.644
REALLY?

10:16.717 --> 10:19.650
I CAN'T BELIEVE
BIG D HAS TO RACE
AGAINST JOEY LOGANO.

10:19.650 --> 10:21.121
GUYS, I CAN WIN THIS.

10:21.121 --> 10:24.124
YOU FORGET: I HIRED THE BEST
PIT CREW IN TOWN.

10:24.124 --> 10:28.198
RIGHT...PIT GUY NUMBER ONE?

10:28.198 --> 10:30.300
YEAH. NOTHING MOTIVATES A TEAM

10:30.300 --> 10:33.163
LIKE A BOSS THAT
DOESN'T KNOW YOUR NAME.

10:33.163 --> 10:34.965
WHATEVER.

10:34.965 --> 10:37.708
LOOK, I'M READY.
BRING ON THE CHECKERED FLAG.

10:37.708 --> 10:39.209
MORNING, GREASE MONKEYS.

10:39.209 --> 10:40.711
I TAKE THAT BACK.

10:42.312 --> 10:45.846
PRINCIPAL PERRY?
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

10:45.846 --> 10:49.319
WORKIN'. I MOONLIGHT
AS AN ANNOUNCER-SLASH-
FLAG WAVER-

10:49.319 --> 10:51.682
SLASH-HOT ROD CALENDAR GIRL.

10:51.682 --> 10:52.823
OOOOH!

10:54.825 --> 10:56.927
NO ONE SELLS LUG NUTS LIKE ME!

10:57.988 --> 10:59.860
AHEM.

10:59.860 --> 11:01.061
PRINCIPAL PERRY,

11:01.061 --> 11:03.694
DON'T ALL OF THESE
SIDE JOBS YOU HAVE

11:03.694 --> 11:05.736
TAKE AWAY YOUR FOCUS FROM
BEING A SCHOOL PRINCIPAL?

11:05.736 --> 11:08.238
OH HO! ABSOLUTELY!

11:08.238 --> 11:10.340
NOW LET'S GO OVER SOME RULES.

11:10.340 --> 11:12.102
HEY, LOGANO. RICH GUY.

11:12.102 --> 11:16.676
GET YOUR SASSY CHASSIS OVER HERE
AND LET'S TALK SOME TRACK.

11:16.676 --> 11:19.910
IN EACH OF MY PRECIOUS PAWS
IS THE DEED TO YOUR HOUSE,

11:19.910 --> 11:22.883
WHICH MAKES YOUR BET
A SQUARE DEAL.

11:22.883 --> 11:26.116
IT'S 200 LAPS AROUND,
WHOEVER CROSSES
THE FINISH LINE FIRST WINS.

11:26.116 --> 11:27.758
WELL,
GOOD LUCK OUT THERE.

11:27.758 --> 11:30.320
THANKS.
I'LL DO MY BEST.

11:36.927 --> 11:38.428
( engines revving )

11:41.331 --> 11:44.004
WHEN I DROP THIS FLAG,
YOU GUYS BURN RUBBER!

11:44.004 --> 11:46.907
OH, AND BY THE WAY,
THIS CAME OFF ONE OF YOUR CARS.

11:46.907 --> 11:49.780
I DON'T KNOW WHAT IT DOES,
BUT IT DOESN'T MATTER NOW!

11:49.780 --> 11:51.281
( revs engine )

11:52.843 --> 11:54.044
( blows raspberry )

11:55.445 --> 11:56.817
( revs engine )

11:56.817 --> 11:57.818
GOOD LUCK!

12:02.953 --> 12:05.796
HANDS AT TEN AND TWO-- CHECK.

12:05.796 --> 12:08.398
MIRRORS ADJUSTED-- CHECK.

12:08.398 --> 12:10.360
OH, HE'S GONNA ALREADY.

12:11.932 --> 12:13.864
( gears grind )

12:13.864 --> 12:16.967
THIS IS VERY DIFFERENT
FROM MY SIMULATOR.

12:16.967 --> 12:18.208
GO!
 GO!
 GO!
 GO!

12:18.208 --> 12:19.239
( gears grind )

12:19.239 --> 12:21.141
( tires screech )

12:32.883 --> 12:35.225
YOU'RE DOING GREAT,
MR. DAVENPORT.

12:35.225 --> 12:36.456
REALLY?

12:36.456 --> 12:39.229
NO. YOU'RE
28 LAPS BEHIND.

12:40.961 --> 12:44.935
PLEASE TELL HIM
HE DOESN'T HAVE TO WAVE
EVERY TIME HE PASSES US.

12:50.240 --> 12:53.343
SO, WHERE ARE YOU GUYS
THINKING ABOUT MOVING?

12:53.343 --> 12:58.078
WELL, MY GUT SAYS CLEVELAND,
BUT I'M AN INDIANA MAN
AT HEART.

12:58.078 --> 13:00.150
WE'RE NOT GONNA LOSE,
CLAYTON.

13:00.150 --> 13:02.953
KEEP TELLING YOURSELF THAT,
JUNIOR.

13:02.953 --> 13:04.784
I'M THE SAME AGE AS YOU.

13:04.784 --> 13:05.956
YOUR WALLET'S NOT.

13:05.956 --> 13:07.858
THAT DOESN'T MAKE ANY SENSE.

13:07.858 --> 13:09.990
MY WALLET MAKES SENSE.

13:09.990 --> 13:12.863
IT TALKS TO ME ALL THE TIME,
AND RIGHT NOW IT'S SAYING,

13:12.863 --> 13:15.025
"CAN I HAVE LEO'S BEDROOM?"

13:15.025 --> 13:16.796
YES, YOU CAN!

13:18.568 --> 13:20.931
OH, YEAH?
WELL, JUST FOR THE RECORD,

13:20.931 --> 13:23.003
YOUR WALLET AND YOUR MONEY
HAVE THE SAME VOICE!

13:25.335 --> 13:26.506
( revving engine )

13:29.409 --> 13:32.182
I CAN'T BELIEVE
I'M LOSING SO BADLY.

13:32.182 --> 13:34.885
YOU DO KNOW THAT
STEPPING THE GAS PEDAL

13:34.885 --> 13:37.047
MAKES IT GO FASTER, RIGHT?

13:37.047 --> 13:39.349
THERE MUST BE SOMETHING
WRONG WITH THE CAR.

13:39.349 --> 13:41.922
OKAY, LET'S BE SMART ABOUT THIS
AND ELIMINATE VARIABLES.

13:41.922 --> 13:45.555
FIRST OF ALL,
ARE WE SURE THE CAR
IS NOT IN REVERSE?

13:47.057 --> 13:49.129
WAIT. IT'S BEEN
ALMOST A MINUTE.

13:49.129 --> 13:51.461
SHOULDN'T YOUR PIT CREW
BE DONE BY NOW?

13:51.461 --> 13:53.533
YEAH, AND WHERE'S
YOUR CREW CHIEF?

13:55.936 --> 13:57.307
( no audible dialogue )

13:57.307 --> 13:59.039
WHAT IS HE DOING
DOWN THERE?

14:02.272 --> 14:04.044
( super-hearing powers up )

14:04.044 --> 14:05.545
Pierce:
THIS IS GOING GREAT.

14:05.545 --> 14:08.448
WHATEVER YOU DID
TO SLOW DOWN DAVENPORT'S CAR

14:08.448 --> 14:09.980
REALLY WORKED.

14:13.023 --> 14:14.324
PIERCE IS CHEATING.

14:14.324 --> 14:16.626
HE PAID YOUR PIT CREW
TO SABOTAGE YOUR CAR.

14:16.626 --> 14:18.388
I KNEW IT.

14:20.160 --> 14:22.492
YOU GUYS ARE FIRED.

14:22.492 --> 14:24.194
GET OUT OF HERE, KEN!

14:24.194 --> 14:26.166
"KEN." THAT WAS IT! UHH!

14:28.969 --> 14:32.142
PROBABLY SHOULDA WAITED
UNTIL THEY PUT THOSE BACK ON.

14:34.104 --> 14:35.976
WAIT. MR. DAVENPORT,

14:35.976 --> 14:38.008
WHAT IF WE REPLACED
YOUR PIT CREW

14:38.008 --> 14:39.980
WITH A BIONIC PIT CREW?

14:39.980 --> 14:42.582
OR WE COULD START ROOTING
FOR JOEY LOGANO.

14:44.014 --> 14:45.485
HEY, JUST THROWING OUT
OPTIONS.

14:47.117 --> 14:49.889
HOLD ON. ISN'T USING BIONICS
TECHNICALLY CHEATING?

14:49.889 --> 14:51.521
LOOK, THEY CHEATED FIRST.

14:51.521 --> 14:54.664
TECHNICALLY, I'M JUST
LEVELING THE PLAYING FIELD.

14:54.664 --> 14:59.169
OKAY. I'LL TAP INTO THE CAR'S
CENTRAL COMPUTER AND OPTIMIZE IT
FOR PEAK PERFORMANCE.

14:59.169 --> 15:02.072
YOU USE YOUR SUPER-SPEED
TO CHANGE THESE TIRES
AND TO GAS IT UP.

15:02.072 --> 15:04.204
AND ADAM--
 --CAN DO THIS.

15:07.577 --> 15:09.339
PRETTY COOL, HUH?

15:09.339 --> 15:10.580
( hissing )

15:10.580 --> 15:12.582
OW! HOT RADIATOR!
HOT RADIATOR!

15:14.144 --> 15:15.245
OW! HOT HOT HOT HOT HOT!

15:16.516 --> 15:17.517
HOT HOT HOT!

15:21.251 --> 15:23.954
WITH 50 LAPS TO GO,
LOGANO'S LEAD IS SHRINKING!

15:23.954 --> 15:26.126
DAVENPORT IS ACTUALLY
CATCHING UP!

15:26.126 --> 15:28.028
AND DON'T FORGET,
YOUR LUG NUT CALENDARS

15:28.028 --> 15:29.960
ARE AVAILABLE AT
THE CONCESSION STAND.

15:29.960 --> 15:32.532
KEEP AN EYE OUT FOR APRIL--
I'M WEARIN' TIRES!

15:46.116 --> 15:49.349
GREAT JOB, CHASE!
THIS CAR IS FLYING NOW!

15:50.680 --> 15:52.052
JOEY! WHAT'S GOING ON?

15:52.052 --> 15:53.623
HOW IS THIS CLOWN
CATCHING UP?

15:53.623 --> 15:56.286
I DON'T KNOW.
HE SPED UP OUT OF NOWHERE.

16:01.291 --> 16:04.394
OKAY, WE NEED TO
CHANGE THE TIRES IN
UNDER TEN SECONDS, OR--

16:06.466 --> 16:07.998
HMM. DONE.

16:10.700 --> 16:12.102
( tires screech )

16:22.382 --> 16:25.385
THIS IS INCREDIBLE.
DAVENPORT HAS EVENED IT UP!

16:25.385 --> 16:28.118
I'M ALMOST BEGINNING
TO CARE WHO WINS!

16:31.121 --> 16:32.462
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?!

16:32.462 --> 16:34.094
I SABOTAGED
DAVENPORT'S CAR

16:34.094 --> 16:35.265
AND YOU STILL
HAVEN'T PUT HIM AWAY?!

16:35.265 --> 16:37.467
WAIT. YOU'VE BEEN
CHEATING THE WHOLE TIME?

16:37.467 --> 16:40.570
YEAH. AND APPARENTLY
 NOT ENOUGH!

16:40.570 --> 16:42.132
( engine off )

16:44.104 --> 16:47.177
I DON'T DRIVE FOR CHEATERS,
JERKS, OR SPOILED RICH GUYS--

16:47.177 --> 16:49.179
CHECK, CHECK, AND CHECK.

16:49.179 --> 16:51.741
W-WHERE YOU GOING?

16:51.741 --> 16:54.114
YOU CAN'T LEAVE!
 JUST DID!

16:55.245 --> 16:58.248
DAD, WE'RE LOSING!
HARRINGTONS DON'T LOSE!

16:58.248 --> 17:00.690
I KNOW, I'M A HARRINGTON!

17:02.322 --> 17:04.594
I'LL JUST HAVE TO
FINISH OFF DAVENPORT MYSELF.

17:07.656 --> 17:10.060
SON, CAN YOU GO ASK HIM
FOR THE KEYS?

17:13.563 --> 17:16.366
SO, IT LOOKS LIKE
MY AFTERNOON JUST FREED UP.
YOU GUYS NEED ANY HELP?

17:16.366 --> 17:18.208
All: UH...

17:18.208 --> 17:21.371
PLEASE SAY YES.
I WANT TO HIDE
FROM THAT FLAG LADY.

17:21.371 --> 17:23.173
Perry: YOO-HOO!

17:23.173 --> 17:26.045
HEY, JOEY! WANNA GO HALFSIES
ON A HOAGIE?

17:34.254 --> 17:36.786
TWO LAPS TO GO
IN THE RICH JERK 500.

17:36.786 --> 17:40.190
DAVENPORT AND PIERCE
ARE NECK AND NECK--
IT'S ANYBODY'S RACE.

17:40.190 --> 17:42.532
AND I THINK WE'RE ALL WONDERING
THE SAME QUESTION:

17:42.532 --> 17:45.195
IS THERE A MRS. LOGANO?

17:49.239 --> 17:50.600
DAVENPORT, YOU'RE DOING GREAT.

17:50.600 --> 17:54.144
JUST PLEASE STOP SAYING
"VROOM VROOM" EVERY TIME
YOU MAKE A TURN.

17:54.144 --> 17:56.176
GOTCHA.

17:58.708 --> 18:01.281
I CAN'T BELIEVE THIS.
I THINK I'M GONNA WIN.

18:01.281 --> 18:02.252
I'M GONNA WIN!

18:02.252 --> 18:03.383
AAAH!

18:04.814 --> 18:08.158
HA! THAT WAS STUPID!
I'VE GOT HIM NOW!

18:08.158 --> 18:09.619
HA HA HA! HA HA!

18:11.321 --> 18:12.362
( tires screech )

18:13.523 --> 18:15.795
YOU DO KNOW
IT POPS BACK ON, RIGHT?

18:17.167 --> 18:19.269
I KNEW THAT.

18:23.273 --> 18:24.504
WHAT IS MR. DAVENPORT DOING?

18:24.504 --> 18:26.406
WHY IS HE SLOWING DOWN?
 HE'S GONNA LOSE!

18:26.406 --> 18:29.479
NO. HE'S OBVIOUSLY GIVING UP.
IT'S THE HONORABLE THING TO DO.

18:29.479 --> 18:32.512
NO, HE'S JUST DRAFTING.

18:32.512 --> 18:34.684
IT'S SOMETHING I LEARNED
FROM MY RACING SIMULATOR.

18:34.684 --> 18:37.817
I'M REDUCING MY WIND RESISTANCE
BY HIDING BEHIND PIERCE'S CAR,

18:37.817 --> 18:40.350
AND THEN I'M GONNA
SLINGSHOT PAST HIM
IN THE STRAIGHTAWAY.

18:40.350 --> 18:42.822
ON MY CONTROLLER
IT'S RED-RED-GREEN-UP ARROW,

18:42.822 --> 18:45.124
BUT I'M PRETTY SURE
I CAN MAKE IT WORK.

19:01.611 --> 19:03.373
HA HA!

19:05.845 --> 19:07.217

19:07.217 --> 19:08.748

19:12.282 --> 19:13.483
SORRY, JOEY.

19:13.483 --> 19:15.625
AH, IT'S ALL RIGHT.
WE ALL DO IT.

19:16.926 --> 19:18.328
AAAH!

19:21.791 --> 19:24.364
AND DAVENPORT CROSSES
THE FINISH LINE!

19:36.606 --> 19:38.508

19:38.508 --> 19:40.310
NOW IT'S TIME FOR
THE REAL RACE--

19:40.310 --> 19:41.511

THAT FLAG LADY.

WHO'S BOSS.

20:04.404 --> 20:06.676

20:06.676 --> 20:08.378
