00:14.680 --> 00:16.760
The new animal took a look around

00:16.840 --> 00:22.080
and immediately chose a place next to
the laziest, greediest beast in the stable.

00:22.160 --> 00:26.120
The master saw this, put a yoke on him
and took him back to the merchant.

00:26.200 --> 00:30.600
- We've heard this one already.
- Has it lost its meaning?

00:30.680 --> 00:33.440
You told it just now
on the way down to the water hole.

00:33.520 --> 00:35.400
<i>(thunder)</i>

01:00.720 --> 01:02.520
Who are you?

01:06.720 --> 01:08.720
I don't know.

02:51.920 --> 02:53.320
I got it.

02:54.200 --> 02:56.840
I got it. Teal'c! Teal'c!

02:56.920 --> 02:58.920
I got it.

03:01.680 --> 03:03.680
I got it.

03:03.760 --> 03:05.560
Sorry, Tyler.

03:05.640 --> 03:08.480
Siler. Master Sergeant Siler.

03:08.560 --> 03:10.560
Three, please.

03:14.760 --> 03:16.760
It's not the Lost City.

03:16.840 --> 03:21.960
There's a subtle difference in meaning
in Asgard translations of early Ancient.

03:22.040 --> 03:24.520
Excuse me. Watch it, watch it.

03:27.240 --> 03:30.040
Hey, where's Major Carter?

03:30.120 --> 03:32.400
She's in Hammond's office.

03:38.000 --> 03:40.000
<i>(Carter) According to the Tok'ra,</i>

03:40.080 --> 03:44.400
Anubis is decimating the forces
of the remaining System Lords.

03:44.480 --> 03:46.560
I got it.

03:46.640 --> 03:49.440
- Hopefully it's not contagious.
- Ha, ha.

03:49.520 --> 03:52.200
The Lost City.

03:52.280 --> 03:55.040
- On the tablet.
- You found it?

03:55.120 --> 03:58.120
Yeah, only it's not the Lost City.
That never made sense.

03:58.200 --> 04:01.960
The tablet is written in Ancient.
How could they lose their own city?

04:02.040 --> 04:05.000
And why call it the Lost City?
They'd call it by its name.

04:05.080 --> 04:08.080
- Mr Quinn...
- It's the City of the Lost.

04:08.160 --> 04:10.720
- Do you have a gate address?
- There's a reference

04:10.800 --> 04:13.760
in some translations
that Dr Jackson was working on

04:13.840 --> 04:17.920
to a city of the Ancients called Vis Uban
as a place where plague began.

04:18.000 --> 04:22.000
This was gonna be the crown jewel
in the entire Ancient domain.

04:22.079 --> 04:25.080
It was still under construction
when the plague broke out.

04:25.160 --> 04:27.040
Two words: gate address.

04:27.120 --> 04:31.800
Four years ago when Ancient knowledge
was downloaded to Colonel O'Neill's mind

04:31.880 --> 04:36.080
he put a bunch of new gate addresses
into the SGC computer.

04:36.160 --> 04:37.680
How many did he put in there?

04:37.760 --> 04:40.680
We've been sending probes
and cataloguing them.

04:40.760 --> 04:43.280
Any relevant planet
goes on the mission list.

04:43.360 --> 04:47.400
- How many have been sent probes?
- Less than a quarter.

04:47.480 --> 04:52.240
Do you think he got these gate addresses
randomly, or could there be an order?

04:52.320 --> 04:53.520
Yeah, I suppose.

04:53.600 --> 04:57.600
If Vis Uban wasn't finished
at the time the Ancient civilisation fell...

04:57.680 --> 05:00.880
You're saying the city we're looking for
is the last on the list.

05:00.960 --> 05:04.800
We've been going in order
from first to last, right?

05:04.880 --> 05:07.640
- Send a probe.
- Yes, sir.

05:10.440 --> 05:14.760
We're not talking about a common cold,
Carter. It was the plague.

05:14.840 --> 05:18.040
Sir, we don't wear a HazMat
every time we step through the gate.

05:18.120 --> 05:21.680
There's always a chance we could be
exposed to something dangerous.

05:21.760 --> 05:27.600
<i>- The place is called the City of the Dead.
- City of the Lost, actually, sir.</i>

05:27.680 --> 05:30.280
Not for lack of a sense of direction.

05:52.120 --> 05:56.840
Well, these folks don't look lost, nor dead.

05:56.920 --> 06:00.360
I don't think that these are the Ancients.

06:00.440 --> 06:02.440
I mean, anything's possible, but...

06:02.520 --> 06:08.920
they look like some sort of a nomadic
tribe that's just taken up residence.

06:15.680 --> 06:17.680
Greetings.

06:17.880 --> 06:19.400
Greetings.

06:19.480 --> 06:23.480
We're travellers
from a planet called Earth.

06:23.560 --> 06:27.760
- You came through the Chaapa-ai?
- The Stargate. Chaapa-ai.

06:29.280 --> 06:31.080
He is Jaffa.

06:31.160 --> 06:33.360
No, but he plays one on TV.

06:34.400 --> 06:39.400
This is Teal'c. He's no longer allied
with the Goa'uld. He's a friend. As are we.

06:39.480 --> 06:41.880
We too are travellers.

06:41.960 --> 06:48.160
This place is not our original home, but
we have been here for some time now.

06:48.320 --> 06:53.320
- If you wish to lay claim...
- No. No, no, nothing like that.

06:53.400 --> 06:56.720
We just want the opportunity
to learn more about your people

06:56.800 --> 07:01.280
and to take a really good look
around these ruins.

07:01.360 --> 07:03.280
We did a sweep of the area, sir.

07:03.360 --> 07:06.560
Maintain a secure perimeter.
50 metres radius from the gate.

07:06.640 --> 07:08.680
Sir?

07:21.400 --> 07:23.880
They are travellers, like us.

07:28.040 --> 07:29.840
They say they are friends.

07:29.920 --> 07:33.480
No one can be a friend
if you know not whether to trust them.

07:33.560 --> 07:35.680
Don't judge a book by its cover.

07:35.760 --> 07:39.480
Enemies' promises
were made to be broken.

07:39.560 --> 07:43.840
<i>And yet honesty is the best policy.</i>

07:43.920 --> 07:46.400
He that has too many friends has none.

07:46.480 --> 07:49.480
Ah, but birds of a feather...

07:51.680 --> 07:54.360
I'm unfamiliar with that story.

07:55.720 --> 07:58.280
What lesson does it teach?

07:59.000 --> 08:02.800
It has to do with flocking,
and togetherness...

08:04.160 --> 08:08.400
and, to be honest, I'm not that familiar
with the particulars myself.

08:08.480 --> 08:11.840
The point is, we're not your enemy.
Give us a chance to prove it.

08:14.160 --> 08:16.760
Colonel.

08:17.120 --> 08:20.920
We found something
you might want to see.

08:31.280 --> 08:33.120
Daniel?

08:35.280 --> 08:37.799
<i>(traveller) Arrom.</i>

08:37.880 --> 08:39.960
- Arrom?
- That's what we call him.

08:40.039 --> 08:42.159
It means "Naked One".

08:43.159 --> 08:46.040
That's how we found him
in the forest two moons ago.

08:46.120 --> 08:48.240
Seems he doesn't remember who he is.

08:48.320 --> 08:50.320
Daniel?

08:51.160 --> 08:53.000
It's OK. It's me, S...

08:58.600 --> 09:01.560
Do you not recognise us, Daniel Jackson?

09:01.640 --> 09:03.960
I'm sorry.

09:11.920 --> 09:13.920
Not even me?

09:24.000 --> 09:26.400
Please leave me alone.

09:29.160 --> 09:31.160
I'm Jack O'Neill.

09:31.280 --> 09:37.000
<i>And, barring some freakish similarity,
you are Doctor Daniel Jackson.</i>

09:40.320 --> 09:43.800
This tent is all I know.

09:43.880 --> 09:47.680
And these people, they're all I know.

09:47.760 --> 09:51.120
Before I woke up in the forest,
I don't remember anything.

09:51.200 --> 09:55.480
I've tried.
I've tried to remember who I was before.

09:56.400 --> 09:59.240
Sometimes I think
it's floating in front of me,

09:59.320 --> 10:02.200
and all I have to do
is reach out and grab it.

10:02.280 --> 10:06.240
I try... and it's gone.

10:09.280 --> 10:13.960
You were a member of my team, SG-1 .
You're a friend of mine.

10:14.040 --> 10:16.680
- Last year, you died.
- I'm dead?

10:18.440 --> 10:21.760
Obviously not. You just sort of died.

10:23.320 --> 10:27.040
Actually, you ascended to
a higher plane of existence.

10:27.120 --> 10:30.040
Last time I saw you,
you were helping us fight Anubis.

10:30.120 --> 10:31.120
Anubis?

10:31.200 --> 10:35.880
Yeah, kind of an over-the-top,
clichÃ© bad guy.

10:35.960 --> 10:39.440
Black cloak, oily skin, kind of spooky.

10:42.000 --> 10:48.080
Anyway, obviously, since then,
you've retaken human form somehow.

10:53.760 --> 10:57.040
Actually, I can see how
this might sound a bit unusual.

10:57.120 --> 10:59.080
A bit?

10:59.160 --> 11:02.600
- Why am I here?
- Hey, why are any of us here?

11:06.720 --> 11:13.040
Honestly, I don't know. But you gotta
trust me: you are Daniel Jackson.

11:13.120 --> 11:16.440
Think of it this way.
Out of all the planets in the galaxy,

11:16.520 --> 11:20.320
why this one, if not for us to find you?

11:21.200 --> 11:23.560
So you're saying
a higher power put me here?

11:23.640 --> 11:27.120
<i>I don't know.
That was generally your department.</i>

11:33.800 --> 11:36.880
- Thanks very much.
- You're welcome.

11:39.760 --> 11:44.320
Jonas and Teal'c are helping SG-3 and 5
begin the preliminary sweep.

11:44.400 --> 11:47.720
Remember when I said
it was like talking to a wall?

11:47.800 --> 11:51.160
We know someone who's ascended
can choose to retake human form.

11:51.240 --> 11:54.000
You think he also chose
to forget everything?

11:54.080 --> 11:57.560
Maybe the part about his memory
isn't voluntary.

11:57.640 --> 12:00.480
Maybe it's punishment
for trying to help us.

12:00.560 --> 12:03.320
He did say he was breaking
some big rules.

12:03.400 --> 12:05.480
So? What?

12:06.360 --> 12:09.280
It's gonna take time to search all the ruins.

12:09.360 --> 12:12.680
There could be weapons
or a power source hidden anywhere.

12:12.760 --> 12:18.760
In the meantime, we try to help Daniel
remember... if that's even possible.

12:18.840 --> 12:20.840
Tag. You're it.

12:28.760 --> 12:30.760
Can I come in?

12:34.480 --> 12:36.480
Sure.

12:47.920 --> 12:50.040
So.

12:50.120 --> 12:53.360
What did you say your name was again?

12:53.440 --> 12:55.880
Samantha Carter.
You used to call me Sam.

12:55.960 --> 12:59.560
- Yeah, well, like I already told Jim...
- Uh, Jack.

12:59.640 --> 13:02.120
Jack?

13:02.200 --> 13:04.480
Yeah. I told him.

13:05.160 --> 13:08.840
I don't understand why you aren't
dying to know all about who you are.

13:08.920 --> 13:11.280
I am.

13:11.360 --> 13:13.240
And I'm not.

13:13.320 --> 13:18.920
- See, it's the "not" part...
- What if I don't like who I was?

13:19.000 --> 13:22.080
What if I don't want to be that person?

13:24.760 --> 13:29.920
What if I don't have it in me to make up
for something I've done wrong?

13:31.080 --> 13:35.200
I have to admit,
that never occurred to me.

13:35.280 --> 13:38.480
Look, we all thought we'd
lost you at one point.

13:38.560 --> 13:42.560
It was one of the hardest things
I have ever been through.

13:42.640 --> 13:44.880
<i>You were - you are brilliant.</i>

13:47.080 --> 13:50.240
One of the most caring, passionate...

13:51.600 --> 13:57.000
You're the type of person who'd give his
life for someone he doesn't even know.

13:57.080 --> 13:59.560
That doesn't sound so bad.

14:00.960 --> 14:02.960
If you had one fault,

14:03.040 --> 14:08.040
it was that you wanted to save people
so badly, to help people so much,

14:08.120 --> 14:11.480
that it tore you apart when
you couldn't make a difference.

14:11.560 --> 14:16.080
That actually sounds
kind of hard to live up to.

14:16.160 --> 14:22.360
All I know is that, if I were you, I would
definitely want to get to know me... you.

14:22.440 --> 14:25.680
- I get it.
- Come back with us.

14:25.760 --> 14:29.360
Let us show you who you are,
instead of just telling you.

14:29.440 --> 14:31.600
I'll think about it.

14:32.880 --> 14:34.880
OK.

14:38.520 --> 14:41.720
Samantha Carter?

14:41.800 --> 14:44.240
Yeah?

14:44.320 --> 14:47.920
Was there ever anything... between us?

14:48.920 --> 14:51.040
Us?

14:51.120 --> 14:53.880
No. No, not in that way.

14:54.880 --> 14:59.000
We were really, really good friends.

14:59.080 --> 15:01.320
OK.

15:13.400 --> 15:15.400
Carter.

15:17.600 --> 15:22.680
Shamda here was just telling me a story
about a dog and some dancing monkeys.

15:22.760 --> 15:25.640
The moral is:
appearances can be deceptive.

15:25.720 --> 15:27.280
I got that.

15:27.360 --> 15:31.320
Very good story. Wonderful.
Full of nuances. I like that.

15:31.400 --> 15:35.400
- We sent up a UAV.
- The ruins are quite extensive.

15:35.480 --> 15:39.560
Yeah. It's gonna take us weeks
to scour this place properly.

15:39.640 --> 15:43.640
- What of Daniel Jackson?
- He's going home.

15:57.640 --> 16:03.200
- Welcome back, Dr Jackson.
- Thank you. Thank you very much.

16:03.280 --> 16:06.920
- You have no memory of who I am?
- None whatsoever.

16:07.000 --> 16:08.800
Neither do l, sir.

16:12.680 --> 16:15.000
That way.

16:15.080 --> 16:18.080
Did I mention you owe me 50 bucks?

16:28.560 --> 16:35.440
I'm happy to say, sir, that he's in perfect
health, except for one small exception.

16:39.840 --> 16:42.000
Wow. That's different.

16:42.080 --> 16:43.920
You recognise me now?

16:46.360 --> 16:50.360
- Has your hair always been that way?
- What way?

16:50.440 --> 16:52.440
Never mind.

16:57.960 --> 17:00.240
<i>(buzzer, lock disengages)</i>

17:06.319 --> 17:10.720
Not exactly home,
but we unpacked some of your stuff.

17:13.040 --> 17:16.400
You kept all this
even though you thought I was dead?

17:16.480 --> 17:19.760
To be honest, we tossed out a ton of junk.

17:21.440 --> 17:24.839
A lot of which seemed to be very valuable.

17:35.920 --> 17:40.320
I... kept a few of your
personal things alive there.

17:45.080 --> 17:47.200
- I know her.
- Really?

17:48.400 --> 17:50.880
I mean, I must, right?

17:50.960 --> 17:52.760
Yeah...

17:52.840 --> 17:56.360
- Who is she? What's her name?
- You tell me.

18:28.440 --> 18:30.320
<i>(knock at door)</i>

18:34.080 --> 18:37.520
- Sorry. Am I interrupting?
- You are not.

18:38.520 --> 18:43.480
I am unable to kelno'reem as I once did,
since I began using tretonin.

18:43.560 --> 18:46.880
- Well, that sounds complicated.
- Indeed.

18:46.960 --> 18:48.960
Enter.

19:01.080 --> 19:03.400
Her name is Sha're.

19:04.400 --> 19:06.880
Yes.

19:06.960 --> 19:10.160
No one told me that.
I remembered that by myself.

19:10.240 --> 19:12.960
I dreamed about her
and when I woke up I knew her name.

19:13.040 --> 19:18.080
- That is good news, Daniel Jackson.
- Yeah, I believe I might have a chance.

19:18.160 --> 19:22.600
If I can remember a name, there's a
chance it's all in there somewhere, right?

19:22.680 --> 19:23.880
Indeed.

19:23.960 --> 19:25.840
So, where is she?

19:32.800 --> 19:34.800
She's dead.

19:43.040 --> 19:45.240
I loved her very much.

19:58.440 --> 20:01.400
This being, Oma Desala,
is very powerful, right?

20:01.480 --> 20:03.880
- That is correct.
- Why would she do this?

20:03.960 --> 20:05.760
If she wanted me to forget...

20:05.840 --> 20:10.000
You spoke of the rules to which you were
subjugated as one of the ascended.

20:10.080 --> 20:13.880
Perhaps she was required to erase
your memories by laws of the Others,

20:13.960 --> 20:17.640
but, as your friend and mentor,
she wished you one day to regain it.

20:17.720 --> 20:21.240
You think she cheated?
Found a way around the rules?

20:21.320 --> 20:23.320
You do not agree?

20:25.320 --> 20:30.400
Tell me about this Anubis.
Why did I break the rules to fight him?

20:30.480 --> 20:32.880
Is it not wise to remember
on your own accord?

20:32.960 --> 20:37.200
No. I need to know why
this is happening to me.

20:44.840 --> 20:49.480
At this point, we believe that we've
mapped the full extent of the ruins.

20:49.560 --> 20:53.000
No fancy guns, or anything cool?

20:53.080 --> 20:56.080
We've only completed
a preliminary investigation.

20:56.160 --> 20:58.160
<i>(footsteps)</i>

21:03.640 --> 21:08.000
Sorry I'm late. I forgot
what time the meeting was.

21:11.640 --> 21:14.720
That's a little joke there.
It's the memory thing.

21:14.800 --> 21:17.240
Dr Jackson, this briefing is classified.

21:17.320 --> 21:20.160
Yeah, Jonas mentioned that, but...

21:20.240 --> 21:23.760
you all said that I used to be
part of this, so...

21:24.760 --> 21:30.480
Look, I can't really give you a good
reason. I just... feel like I should be here.

21:34.200 --> 21:36.200
Good enough.

21:39.480 --> 21:43.520
Besides, who will I tell?
I don't remember anybody, right?

21:43.880 --> 21:46.280
- Good one.
- Thanks, Jim.

21:49.000 --> 21:51.080
Oh, so, there are extensive writings,

21:51.160 --> 21:55.080
all in the oldest known Ancient dialects,
all yet to be translated.

21:55.160 --> 21:59.480
But so far we haven't found any signs of
any advanced weapons or power sources.

21:59.560 --> 22:04.920
The original name of the city, Vis Uban,
does translate as "place of great power",

22:05.000 --> 22:08.120
but it doesn't mean we'll find a way
to defeat Anubis there.

22:08.200 --> 22:10.240
You won't.

22:13.720 --> 22:16.400
- It's not the Lost City.
- How do you know?

22:16.480 --> 22:19.400
Because Jonas translated "lacun"
to mean "of the lost".

22:19.480 --> 22:21.560
- But that's...
- The wrong place.

22:21.640 --> 22:26.200
- But the translations in your notes...
- Also wrong. I was way off.

22:26.280 --> 22:30.560
- How do you know that?
- I don't know. I know what the tablet says.

22:30.640 --> 22:32.040
How?

22:32.120 --> 22:35.120
I don't know. I just
looked at it and understood it.

22:35.200 --> 22:39.320
Are you saying the Ancients
actually lost one of their own cities?

22:39.400 --> 22:44.920
No, they didn't lose it. They made it lost...
to other people that might try to find it.

22:45.000 --> 22:47.960
I'm guessing that they camouflaged it

22:48.040 --> 22:51.040
and removed all reference to it
from the written history.

22:51.120 --> 22:52.680
So...

22:52.760 --> 22:56.400
the Lost City is... still lost.

22:56.480 --> 22:58.240
I'm pretty sure.

22:59.960 --> 23:02.080
You told me to give Anubis that Eye.

23:02.160 --> 23:06.760
According to our allies, Anubis is quickly
conquering the other System Lords.

23:06.840 --> 23:09.080
He will dominate the galaxy very soon.

23:09.160 --> 23:13.560
I did it cos you said we could whup his
ass with what we'd find in this Lost City.

23:13.640 --> 23:17.480
If I said that, then I hope it's true, but...

23:18.160 --> 23:22.960
Look, all I know is that the place
you're searching right now is not it.

23:23.040 --> 23:26.000
Then where is "it"?

23:27.320 --> 23:29.320
Did I just say "all I know"?

23:30.560 --> 23:33.160
Everyone turn away.

23:34.440 --> 23:36.800
I want no witnesses.

23:43.440 --> 23:45.440
Yeah?

23:46.160 --> 23:47.560
Hey.

23:47.640 --> 23:48.920
Sorry to bother you.

23:49.000 --> 23:53.640
You're not. I was just...
reading about us, actually.

23:57.000 --> 24:01.160
You said that Anubis was part-ascended,

24:01.240 --> 24:05.240
that the Ancients tried to send him back
to our level of existence but failed,

24:05.320 --> 24:07.560
and now he's trapped
somewhere in between.

24:07.640 --> 24:08.960
So I've heard.

24:09.040 --> 24:12.960
Anubis wouldn't know everything there is
to know about the Ancients, right?

24:13.040 --> 24:17.280
- Or he'd have already found the Lost City.
- I know I read that tablet but...

24:17.360 --> 24:19.480
I'm just thinking out loud here.

24:19.560 --> 24:22.760
If Anubis were to
accidentally find the tablet,

24:22.840 --> 24:25.520
he's not gonna make
the same mistake I did.

24:25.600 --> 24:27.160
I don't know.

24:27.240 --> 24:33.000
But if we were to make a replica
of the tablet, change what it says...

24:33.080 --> 24:34.560
Why?

25:06.000 --> 25:09.000
As you all know, we've had
little success using naquadria

25:09.080 --> 25:12.640
to power the F-302's hyperspace
generator for any length of time.

25:12.720 --> 25:15.320
However, if our calculations are correct,

25:15.400 --> 25:19.120
we believe a short, controlled burst
would send the 302 into subspace

25:19.200 --> 25:21.680
long enough to bypass
the mother ship's shields.

25:21.760 --> 25:24.400
And if your calculations are incorrect?

25:24.480 --> 25:29.120
The 302 would bypass the mother ship
altogether - or worse, re-emerge inside it.

25:29.200 --> 25:32.880
- But let's not go there right now.
- Of course. Let's not dwell.

25:33.920 --> 25:37.800
<i>(clears throat) According to
intelligence provided by the Tok'ra,</i>

25:37.880 --> 25:40.080
the power core of Anubis's new weapon

25:40.160 --> 25:43.720
must be cooled by a ventilation shaft
on the exterior of the ship.

25:43.800 --> 25:47.760
If that can be targeted and destroyed
just as the weapon is powering up,

25:47.840 --> 25:51.560
the crystals will overheat
and be destroyed.

25:53.400 --> 25:55.800
Where is this shaft, exactly?

25:57.960 --> 26:03.200
As Colonel O'Neill is well aware,
we don't know exactly where the shaft is.

26:03.280 --> 26:07.480
Our operative in Anubis's ranks has been
unable to get aboard the new ship

26:07.560 --> 26:10.800
and has only a very limited
working knowledge of it.

26:10.880 --> 26:15.880
Anubis's computer systems use elaborate
ciphers in the oldest Ancient dialect.

26:15.960 --> 26:17.960
We are unable to translate them.

26:18.040 --> 26:23.800
Jonas and Daniel will sneak aboard
Anubis's ship and access the computer.

26:23.880 --> 26:26.560
We have devised
an injectable radioactive isotope

26:26.640 --> 26:30.960
that will allow them to move freely,
undetected by sensors for eight hours.

26:31.040 --> 26:34.920
They'll decode and relay the target's
location to Colonel O'Neill and me,

26:35.000 --> 26:37.000
who will be flying the F-302.

26:37.080 --> 26:41.000
- No problem, right?
- Hey, sounds easy to me.

26:42.680 --> 26:48.320
Good. Anubis's ship is destroyed,
and we all live to save another day.

26:48.400 --> 26:53.720
Again, as the Colonel is well aware,
we have reason to believe

26:53.800 --> 26:57.440
that eliminating the crystal power core
of the ship's main weapon

26:57.520 --> 27:00.040
won't destroy the entire ship.

27:00.120 --> 27:03.200
Its defences and auxiliary weapons
will remain intact.

27:03.280 --> 27:05.720
Why don't we dwell on that
for just a minute?

27:05.800 --> 27:08.760
Our goal is to take out
Anubis's new superweapon.

27:08.840 --> 27:12.600
It gives him a clear advantage
over the other Goa'uld mother ships.

27:12.680 --> 27:18.880
We've heard from Teal'c that Yu will bring
the System Lords' fleet down on Anubis

27:18.960 --> 27:20.960
once we've succeeded.

27:21.880 --> 27:27.240
OK. Everyone who thinks this is
an insane idea, raise your hand.

27:27.960 --> 27:31.840
Come on, be honest.
Let's go. Get 'em up there.

27:34.880 --> 27:37.800
Keep your hands up, people,
because the next question is:

27:37.880 --> 27:40.560
who is going to make this happen?

27:42.000 --> 27:46.240
It's going to take us at least a week
to relocate the inhabitants of the ruins.

27:46.320 --> 27:48.920
Which will give us time
to build a makeshift runway

27:49.000 --> 27:51.520
and get the 302
through the gate and reassembled.

27:51.600 --> 27:57.120
And once everything is established,
the Tok'ra will plant our fake tablet,

27:57.200 --> 28:00.120
and, with any luck,
we'll lure Anubis to the planet.

28:00.200 --> 28:02.800
Let's move.

28:11.560 --> 28:15.000
Look, I realise I wasn't
the most positive voice in the room.

28:15.080 --> 28:17.240
We all know it's an extreme long shot, sir.

28:17.320 --> 28:21.920
My big problem is that all this depends
on us trusting a Goa'uld to back us up.

28:22.000 --> 28:25.000
This is our only chance to take Anubis
out of the picture,

28:25.080 --> 28:27.080
and Yu has helped us in the past.

28:27.160 --> 28:30.080
All I'm saying, just for the record,

28:30.160 --> 28:32.800
this is the wackiest plan
we've ever come up with.

28:32.880 --> 28:36.000
Wackier than strapping
an active Stargate onto the X-302?

28:36.080 --> 28:37.640
Oh, yeah.

28:37.720 --> 28:39.800
Wackier than blowing up a sun?

28:39.880 --> 28:41.800
Yep.

28:45.560 --> 28:47.560
He's probably right.

29:08.760 --> 29:11.000
My lord, the fleet is ready.

29:11.720 --> 29:15.120
<i>- I say when the fleet is ready.
- Of course, my lord.</i>

29:19.440 --> 29:23.360
It is time we moved them into position
to prepare for the ambush of Anubis,

29:23.440 --> 29:25.200
as you agreed, my lord.

29:25.280 --> 29:29.760
Speak to me as if I am a fool again
and you will not take another breath.

29:29.840 --> 29:31.360
Yes, my lord.

29:41.440 --> 29:45.040
<i>(distorted) Move the fleet into position.</i>

29:55.800 --> 29:58.000
That's your son.

29:58.080 --> 30:00.880
- Yeah.
- Charlie, right?

30:01.880 --> 30:06.560
He's why I know you. You took that first
mission to Abydos thinking it'd be suicide.

30:06.640 --> 30:09.640
- Things change.
- Yeah. Sorry.

30:11.720 --> 30:14.560
You sure you're ready for this?

30:14.640 --> 30:20.560
Despite what you say, I don't think you'd
be doing this if it wasn't worth doing.

30:20.640 --> 30:25.720
You obviously don't remember everything.
You never used to follow my lead.

30:25.800 --> 30:27.800
I didn't?

30:30.720 --> 30:33.040
Hey.

30:33.120 --> 30:38.680
I may not remember everything but...
I remember enough.

30:42.920 --> 30:44.920
Good.

31:02.600 --> 31:05.880
- Sir, welcome to base camp.
- Thank you, Major.

31:05.960 --> 31:08.480
I have to admit,
it's strange to see you offworld.

31:08.560 --> 31:12.160
This is not your usual
alien-planet operation, is it, Major?

31:12.240 --> 31:13.240
No, sir.

31:13.320 --> 31:16.320
- What's our status?
- We're ready to go, sir.

31:16.400 --> 31:20.120
- You'd better get yourself out to the F-302.
- Yes, sir.

31:39.520 --> 31:45.320
We just received word. Anubis's ship will
be arriving in the system momentarily.

31:50.480 --> 31:55.360
<i>Air Strike, this is Command Base.
You are a go for take-off.</i>

31:56.960 --> 31:59.680
I thought we were going
with Red Leader on this one.

31:59.760 --> 32:01.600
<i>(Carter) All systems go, sir.</i>

32:01.680 --> 32:05.640
Uh... Command? There is one more thing.

32:05.720 --> 32:09.080
Colonel, Major...

32:09.160 --> 32:10.560
Godspeed.

32:10.640 --> 32:13.280
All right, that's better.

32:13.920 --> 32:15.920
Thank you, sir.

33:15.040 --> 33:17.640
- Thanks, guys.
- Good luck.

33:38.640 --> 33:42.880
Holy crap! Look at that thing. It's huge!

33:42.960 --> 33:47.920
I think they know we're coming, sir.
Tally four gliders, nose, 400 kilometres.

34:21.840 --> 34:24.360
Extending. Max burn.

34:24.440 --> 34:28.199
- You're heading right for them.
- I want to see what this is made of.

34:28.280 --> 34:33.480
- I could tell you exactly, sir.
- Another time... maybe... please?

34:47.639 --> 34:49.639
Fox 4-2.

34:57.920 --> 35:01.360
Pitching back, left, 1-3-5.

35:04.560 --> 35:07.840
<i>(Carter) Daniel, Jonas, we are
under attack. We need that intel.</i>

35:07.920 --> 35:12.120
- We're close.
- We can't hold these guys off for long.

35:12.200 --> 35:15.360
<i>(banging at door, men shouting)</i>

35:15.440 --> 35:17.920
Great. We got company.

35:25.720 --> 35:28.080
- My lord.
- Take the fleet to Chodawa.

35:28.160 --> 35:32.560
My lord, that is across the galaxy.
We are in position to ambush Anubis...

35:32.640 --> 35:36.400
Do not question me. I am your god.

35:36.480 --> 35:38.840
Do as I say.

35:38.920 --> 35:41.560
- You cannot.
- I have no choice.

35:41.640 --> 35:43.040
Take him to a holding cell.

35:43.120 --> 35:47.120
If you do not eliminate Anubis, you
are dooming yourself and your master.

35:47.200 --> 35:49.480
I must do as my god commands.

36:01.320 --> 36:03.320
My lord.

36:06.600 --> 36:10.280
Our ground troops confirm that
there is a human base on the planet.

36:10.360 --> 36:15.440
<i>- (distorted) The search of the city?
- No energy signatures.</i>

36:21.240 --> 36:23.240
<i>(thumping at door)</i>

36:26.040 --> 36:29.320
That'll hold 'em off for a while.

36:29.400 --> 36:32.840
<i>- (men shouting)
- A little while.</i>

36:33.800 --> 36:36.080
That's it. I'm in.

36:36.160 --> 36:38.720
This may take more than a little while.

36:38.800 --> 36:41.880
Can't you do some kind
of a keyword search?

36:41.960 --> 36:43.960
For what? "Achilles"?

36:44.040 --> 36:49.040
I'm glad to see your memory's coming
back, not to mention your razor-sharp wit.

36:49.120 --> 36:53.520
But why don't we try something like...
"power-core venting"?

36:56.000 --> 36:57.800
That's it, that's it.

36:58.320 --> 37:01.440
Jack, Sam, we got it. Transmitting data.

37:09.080 --> 37:11.080
We gotta go, Carter.

37:11.160 --> 37:14.360
Sir, I've got the data, but
we need Anubis to power the weapon.

37:14.440 --> 37:19.240
Airborne, we have not heard from Teal'c.
The Goa'uld fleet is long overdue.

37:19.320 --> 37:22.200
<i>(O'Neill) See?
I had a problem with this plan.</i>

37:22.280 --> 37:27.280
My lord, the attack vessel
continues to elude our gliders.

37:27.360 --> 37:30.440
<i>(Anubis, distorted)
Send in another squadron.</i>

37:31.520 --> 37:34.960
I do not believe
what you are searching for is here.

37:35.040 --> 37:37.960
- I agree.
- Shall I target their base, my lord?

37:38.040 --> 37:41.640
No. Recall the ground troops.

37:43.800 --> 37:45.120
Yes, my lord.

37:46.560 --> 37:50.760
I don't think we're gonna get
back to the ring room that way.

37:50.840 --> 37:54.720
- What's that?
- They're targeting the planet.

37:54.800 --> 37:57.880
- Base camp, this is Jonas. Come in.
- Go ahead.

37:57.960 --> 38:03.400
<i>Your position's been compromised.
The Stargate is being targeted.</i>

38:03.480 --> 38:05.600
The naqahdah will amplify the blast.

38:05.680 --> 38:09.160
Roger that. Evacuate all personnel.

38:14.600 --> 38:16.040
We go at it now, right?

38:16.120 --> 38:19.120
We need the Goa'uld mother ships
here to finish the job.

38:19.200 --> 38:23.120
- Sir, four more gliders headed this way.
- Can we go at it now?

38:23.200 --> 38:25.480
Activating hyperdrive.

38:27.920 --> 38:29.920
Extending, straight up.

38:36.720 --> 38:38.800
Damn, that was close.

38:38.880 --> 38:42.320
Transferring target data
to your terminal, sir.

38:46.360 --> 38:49.520
The human attack vessel
has breached our shields.

38:49.600 --> 38:50.720
Shoot it down.

38:52.640 --> 38:54.720
- Let's get outta here.
- Yeah.

38:56.400 --> 38:58.280
<i>(men shouting)</i>

39:21.680 --> 39:24.320
Target is locked. Fox 4-2.

39:32.800 --> 39:36.080
- Nice shot, sir.
- Well, thank you, ma'am.

39:37.240 --> 39:40.360
The core is overloading.
We must power down the weapon.

39:51.320 --> 39:53.880
<i>(roars)</i>

40:07.200 --> 40:09.600
<i>(Carter) Daniel, come in. Do you read?</i>

40:09.680 --> 40:11.960
Yeah. I'm still on the ship.

40:13.560 --> 40:16.920
- Hey, congratulations. You hit the mark.
- Thanks. It was fun.

40:17.000 --> 40:20.960
We'll wait until Anubis's ship goes
and rendezvous with you at the Stargate.

40:21.040 --> 40:24.040
As far as that goes,
we may have a little problem.

40:28.120 --> 40:30.720
You will suffer gravely.

40:31.600 --> 40:36.080
Yeah, I figured as much.
Although I am consoled by the fact

40:36.160 --> 40:40.360
that we succeeded in destroying
the power source for your new weapon.

40:40.440 --> 40:42.920
You are in no position to gloat.

40:43.000 --> 40:48.120
We just wiped out your single advantage
you had over the Goa'uld.

40:48.200 --> 40:52.160
I would say that's about
as good a reason as any.

40:52.240 --> 40:54.640
Enough.

40:54.720 --> 41:00.760
- I won't tell you anything.
- Oh, yes, you will.
