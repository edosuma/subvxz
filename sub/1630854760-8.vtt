WEBVTT

00:04.230 --> 00:06.714
- We call the defendant,
Laura Broder.

00:17.259 --> 00:19.518
- Please raise your right hand.

00:20.521 --> 00:23.597
Do you swear to tell the truth,
the whole truth,

00:23.673 --> 00:25.983
and nothing but the truth?

00:36.779 --> 00:38.019
- Ma'am?

00:38.764 --> 00:41.948
Do you swear to tell the truth,
the whole truth

00:42.101 --> 00:44.126
and nothing but the truth?

00:49.608 --> 00:54.928
- Truth, for Plato, is
absolute.

00:55.464 --> 00:57.556
It's objective.

00:58.784 --> 01:01.560
It transcends physical forms,

01:02.045 --> 01:04.396
indifferent to us mortals.

01:06.233 --> 01:10.069
Truth doesn't need us
to believe it.

01:10.738 --> 01:12.071
It just is.

01:13.132 --> 01:14.314
Thanks, guys.

01:14.466 --> 01:16.492
We'll see you all next week.

01:18.637 --> 01:20.746
- Here's the updated syllabus
with the new dates.

01:21.640 --> 01:24.416
You know, if you want,
I can make
the midterm revisions myself.

01:24.493 --> 01:26.568
- No. No, I got it.
- Okay.

01:26.587 --> 01:28.712
I think it's amazing
that you're teaching.

01:30.740 --> 01:31.998
- Well, it is my job.

01:32.075 --> 01:33.834
- No, yeah, of course.

01:33.928 --> 01:35.485
I, I just...

01:36.488 --> 01:39.172
it's only been two months
since your son passed.

01:39.325 --> 01:40.657
- Right.
Well, he didn't pass exactly.

01:40.676 --> 01:43.644
He was gunned down.
Along with eight other children.

01:45.998 --> 01:47.356
I'm...

01:48.834 --> 01:50.150
I'm sorry.

01:56.024 --> 01:57.098
(knocking)

01:57.118 --> 01:58.659
- Hey, bud.

02:02.030 --> 02:03.580
How are you doing?

02:05.033 --> 02:06.625
- It's just weird.

02:08.278 --> 02:09.353
Seeing his name.

02:09.371 --> 02:11.588
I don't know if I'm supposed
to like...

02:12.524 --> 02:14.424
delete it or what.

02:15.952 --> 02:17.553
- Yeah. I don't know.

02:19.214 --> 02:20.455
You don't have homework?

02:20.532 --> 02:22.382
What about your History essay?

02:23.369 --> 02:25.869
- No one's really gonna fail me
right now.

02:25.888 --> 02:27.521
(scoffs)

02:28.149 --> 02:29.373
- Okay.

02:29.466 --> 02:31.892
Well, if you wanna brainstorm,
I'm happy to.

02:32.044 --> 02:36.071
Or you can, you can... you can
talk it out with your mom.

02:37.825 --> 02:39.140
(sighs)

02:39.234 --> 02:41.160
Look, I know she's been tough
to reach lately,

02:41.311 --> 02:43.662
but she's here for ya, okay?

02:48.169 --> 02:49.334
She's picking me up.

02:49.411 --> 02:51.578
We're supposed to be
at the studio at 5:30.

02:51.655 --> 02:53.321
We should be back by 7.

02:53.399 --> 02:54.581
- She's doing another interview?

02:54.733 --> 02:57.234
- Well, it's something
she feels she need to do.

02:57.252 --> 02:59.403
She's just tryin' to...

02:59.421 --> 03:02.139
make sense out of all this,
you know?

03:03.667 --> 03:04.683
Jonah?

03:04.760 --> 03:06.185
- Yeah.

03:06.261 --> 03:07.728
Fine.

03:19.107 --> 03:21.182
- Hi.
- Sorry, I'm late.

03:21.202 --> 03:22.850
- We've got time.

03:23.445 --> 03:26.020
- I snapped at my TA
for no reason

03:26.040 --> 03:28.957
then I insisted
on buying him a coffee.
- Hm.

03:29.618 --> 03:31.117
How was your class?

03:31.194 --> 03:32.436
- Uh,

03:32.529 --> 03:35.288
used to be they were
all staring at their phones.

03:35.441 --> 03:38.175
Now they're staring at me
like I've got three heads.

03:40.054 --> 03:42.012
How's Jonah?

03:43.131 --> 03:45.390
- Maybe you should ask him.

03:46.134 --> 03:48.009
- What does that mean?

03:48.620 --> 03:50.287
- Nothing, just...

03:50.305 --> 03:53.214
he's still got
some assignments overdue

03:53.234 --> 03:54.791
and he might need your help.

03:54.793 --> 03:56.884
Maybe you could try to spend
some time with him?

03:56.962 --> 03:58.478
- I have been meaning to.

03:58.630 --> 04:02.449
- I know.
- I don't know
why it feels so hard.

04:05.320 --> 04:07.153
<i> Joining us now via satellite</i>

04:07.230 --> 04:09.063
<i> Professor Laura Broder,</i>

04:09.083 --> 04:10.640
<i> whose 12-year-old son, Liam,</i>

04:10.659 --> 04:12.476
<i> was one of the nine children</i>
<i> killed</i>

04:12.478 --> 04:15.312
<i> when a fellow student opened</i>
<i> fire at Park Ridge High School</i>

04:15.314 --> 04:16.813
<i> in Lake Forest, Illinois.</i>

04:16.906 --> 04:18.315
<i> She's calling</i>
<i> on the State Senate</i>

04:18.317 --> 04:21.075
<i>to pass two pieces of gun safety</i>
<i> legislation</i>

04:21.095 --> 04:22.669
<i> currently being debated.</i>

04:22.746 --> 04:24.838
<i> Professor, thank you</i>
<i> for speaking with us today.</i>

04:24.914 --> 04:26.448
- Thank you for having me.

04:26.658 --> 04:30.251
<i>- Before we go any further, what</i>
<i> can you tell me about your son?</i>

04:30.920 --> 04:34.439
- Well.
He was a very special kid.

04:34.924 --> 04:36.182
When he grew up,

04:36.277 --> 04:39.836
he wanted to split his time
as a marine biologist

04:39.838 --> 04:42.172
and a professional
ice-cream maker.

04:42.674 --> 04:45.266
<i> - You were kind enough</i>
<i> to share a photo.</i>

04:45.727 --> 04:49.288
<i> I understand he was quite</i>
<i> the expert on turtles.</i>

04:49.364 --> 04:51.272
- Yes, turtles were
his favorite.

04:51.292 --> 04:52.958
Even when he was little.

04:53.035 --> 04:55.702
He would pull out fun facts

04:55.854 --> 04:58.714
mostly to bargain
for more screen time.

04:59.783 --> 05:01.207
"What's five more minutes?

05:01.360 --> 05:03.618
Turtles live 150 years."

05:04.546 --> 05:08.456
<i> - This is obviously</i>
<i> an immensely difficult time.</i>

05:08.475 --> 05:12.293
<i> But yet you've chosen to speak</i>
<i> publicly and lobby for action.</i>

05:12.313 --> 05:13.478
- Yes,

05:13.630 --> 05:15.705
shootings like these

05:15.707 --> 05:17.465
aren't natural disasters.

05:17.484 --> 05:20.560
They're preventable.
There are things we can do.

05:20.712 --> 05:24.305
And Senate Bill 83 would close
the gun show loophole

05:24.383 --> 05:27.326
and reinstate the ban
on assault rifles.

05:27.402 --> 05:28.885
Look, I...

05:28.887 --> 05:30.904
I can't bring back my son

05:31.740 --> 05:35.667
but I can do everything in my
power to prevent another one.

05:35.819 --> 05:38.895
<i> So that no other parents</i>
<i> have to go through</i>

05:38.914 --> 05:41.398
<i> a nightmare like this.</i>

05:41.400 --> 05:44.659
<i> - And to those who deny</i>
<i> it happened altogether?</i>

05:45.679 --> 05:49.389
<i> I assume you're aware of the</i>
<i> hashtag "ParkRidgeExposed"?</i>

05:49.999 --> 05:51.016
(scoffs)

05:51.167 --> 05:52.500
<i> Professor?</i>

05:52.578 --> 05:53.910
- Sorry, I...

05:54.413 --> 05:57.097
<i> - This was posted</i>
<i> by a Joanna Pierce.</i>

05:57.249 --> 05:59.524
<i> One of the most vocal deniers.</i>

05:59.601 --> 06:03.511
- Yes, I have seen
the so-called footage
with my own two eyes

06:03.589 --> 06:06.439
<i> and you can see...</i>
<i> you can obviously see,</i>

06:06.516 --> 06:10.351
<i>when the kids start running out</i>
<i> of the building,</i>
<i> the tape doubles back.</i>

06:10.429 --> 06:11.778
<i> Twice.</i>

06:11.930 --> 06:13.947
<i> Like it's been doctored.</i>

06:14.099 --> 06:16.766
<i> And no one is talking</i>
<i> about that! No one!</i>

06:16.785 --> 06:20.212
<i> And lemme tell you,</i>
<i> these people who have hijacked</i>
<i> our country,</i>

06:20.288 --> 06:23.456
<i> the globalists, uh,</i>
<i> pedophiles, child traffickers,</i>

06:23.550 --> 06:26.610
<i> they have tentacles in every</i>
<i>pocket of the government, media,</i>

06:26.628 --> 06:28.294
<i> and don't think for a second</i>

06:28.463 --> 06:32.039
<i> they wouldn't have staged</i>
<i> something like this,</i>
<i> 'cause they would.</i>

06:32.059 --> 06:33.875
<i> So they can come into my home</i>

06:33.894 --> 06:38.880
<i> and confiscate my guns</i>
<i> and violate</i>
<i> my Second Amendment rights?</i>

06:38.957 --> 06:40.381
<i> Uh-uh.</i>

06:40.401 --> 06:43.476
<i> Because these kids didn't die.</i>

06:44.463 --> 06:47.464
<i> (chuckles)</i>
<i> None of this is real!</i>

06:47.799 --> 06:50.558
<i> None of it!</i>
<i> It's not real.</i>

06:51.895 --> 06:55.972
<i> - As of this morning,</i>
<i> it has nearly a million views.</i>

06:55.991 --> 06:58.708
<i> Any response to her claim?</i>

07:03.982 --> 07:05.498
- That was a total ambush.

07:05.651 --> 07:07.575
We were supposed to be talking
about the legislation.

07:07.594 --> 07:10.353
- I know, but you handled it
as well as you could have.

07:10.355 --> 07:11.930
- My God,
it really is everywhere.

07:12.081 --> 07:13.840
- Lo, there's a reason
we didn't look.

07:13.934 --> 07:18.161
- What the hell is she doing
amplifying this crap
on national television?

07:18.163 --> 07:20.180
I mean, it's completely
irresponsible.

07:20.332 --> 07:21.514
- Listen to me.
It's done.

07:21.667 --> 07:24.184
I'm proud of you.
I'm really upset about it too

07:24.260 --> 07:26.486
but there's nothing
we can do about it.

07:28.097 --> 07:29.990
- Look at this.

07:35.438 --> 07:37.347
- I understand the platforms
aren't liable,

07:37.365 --> 07:40.200
but there are still
laws against defamation, right?

07:40.352 --> 07:42.777
(door creaking)
- Mom. Food's here.

07:42.796 --> 07:45.188
- I'm sorry,
could you repeat that?
- It's gonna get cold.

07:45.190 --> 07:47.340
- Just start without me, okay?

07:48.952 --> 07:50.760
(sighs)
- Yeah.

07:54.641 --> 07:56.975
- First she wants to rewrite
the Second Amendment,

07:57.126 --> 07:58.977
now she's gonna sue
Mark Zuckerberg?

07:59.054 --> 08:00.720
- She was blindsided.

08:00.797 --> 08:03.106
You can understand that,
can't you?

08:06.712 --> 08:08.803
- Well, thanks to Article 230,

08:08.880 --> 08:11.397
apparently none of
the social media companies are
responsible

08:11.550 --> 08:13.474
for any of the content
on their sites.

08:13.494 --> 08:16.736
He did say that if they...
use Liam's image,

08:16.813 --> 08:20.147
we can flag that
as a copyright violation.

08:20.167 --> 08:21.891
- Well, that's something.

08:21.910 --> 08:24.503
- So it's our job
to go through this crap?

08:24.579 --> 08:26.338
It's illegal to use his image

08:26.414 --> 08:29.156
but saying that he never
existed, that's fair game?

08:29.234 --> 08:30.509
- This is what they do, Mom.

08:30.585 --> 08:32.919
These Covid truthers,
vaccine truthers.

08:33.071 --> 08:36.239
- Can we not call them
"truthers"?
- Call them whatever you want.

08:36.258 --> 08:38.908
Maybe check Twitter
before going on national TV.

08:38.927 --> 08:41.353
- Alright. Just take a breath.
- What's that supposed to mean?

08:41.429 --> 08:43.337
- I mean it wasn't exactly
a secret.

08:43.357 --> 08:46.340
- Wait, you knew about this?
And you didn't think to tell us?

08:46.418 --> 08:48.026
- I knew you'd do this.
- What?

08:48.177 --> 08:49.936
- "This?" What,
what am I supposed to do?

08:50.030 --> 08:53.198
- Ignore it, Mom,
like... like a normal person.

08:53.349 --> 08:54.941
This is how the internet works.

08:55.093 --> 08:56.517
- Yeah. I get that, Jonah.

08:56.578 --> 08:58.519
Okay. I'm not naive.

08:59.097 --> 09:01.581
But this is your brother.

09:02.209 --> 09:03.767
This is his memory.

09:03.785 --> 09:06.286
This is what comes up
when you search Liam's name.

09:06.362 --> 09:09.047
- Yeah, well somehow
I don't think he cares.

09:18.950 --> 09:20.633
- I'll talk to him.

09:20.786 --> 09:22.561
- No. I'll, I'll, I'll do it.

09:22.637 --> 09:24.646
I just...
I need a minute.

09:27.626 --> 09:30.527
It's like they're killing him
all over again.

09:37.578 --> 09:39.152
(door slamming shut)

09:39.228 --> 09:41.580
(Jonah pants)

09:45.752 --> 09:47.377
- Jonah!

09:48.163 --> 09:49.996
We need to be in there.

09:50.073 --> 09:52.090
We need to be strong for her.

09:52.241 --> 09:54.909
- No, this...
this is so messed up.

09:54.928 --> 09:56.836
I...
this is my fault.

09:56.913 --> 09:58.579
- Shh... shh... Okay.
It's alright.

09:58.599 --> 10:00.006
- I'm gonna be sick.
- It's okay.

10:00.158 --> 10:02.124
Look... look at me.

10:02.769 --> 10:05.562
We all made mistakes. Okay?

10:06.589 --> 10:08.398
All of us.

10:12.762 --> 10:14.446
(door closing)

10:26.960 --> 10:29.461
(theme music)

10:42.792 --> 10:45.310
- I'm having a hard time...

10:45.979 --> 10:49.481
...with all the uh, noise,
I guess.

10:50.208 --> 10:51.983
- How do you mean?

10:52.060 --> 10:54.486
- All these lunatics online

10:54.562 --> 10:56.562
claiming the whole thing
was staged.

10:56.715 --> 10:58.156
That no one really died.

10:58.233 --> 11:00.750
- That's disgusting.
- Unbelievable.

11:00.752 --> 11:03.995
- It's hard enough accepting...

11:04.614 --> 11:06.556
...that Liam's gone.

11:06.574 --> 11:08.741
But knowing that there are
people out there

11:08.818 --> 11:11.586
insisting
that he wasn't real?

11:15.083 --> 11:16.966
I've been...

11:18.161 --> 11:20.470
...wondering
what we might do.

11:20.906 --> 11:22.013
- Do?

11:22.683 --> 11:26.592
- We've been considering
publishing Liam's death
certificate online.

11:26.669 --> 11:30.522
- Well, we've been...
we've been talking about it.
- Well...

11:31.525 --> 11:33.191
Eric thinks I'm crazy.

11:33.342 --> 11:35.985
- I don't think you're crazy.
I just...

11:37.013 --> 11:38.679
I don't see the point of it.

11:39.700 --> 11:43.851
- What if we were to make
a statement together?

11:43.870 --> 11:45.995
Just something.

11:48.191 --> 11:50.191
It's not going away.

11:50.210 --> 11:51.784
If anything,
it's getting worse.

11:51.861 --> 11:55.455
And people are asking
why we're not saying anything.

11:55.531 --> 11:57.549
You know, like as if
we have something to hide.

11:57.625 --> 12:00.944
- People are monsters.
They're sick.

12:00.946 --> 12:02.128
- Some of them.

12:02.280 --> 12:04.538
But some of them
must be reachable.

12:04.616 --> 12:08.226
I mean, I tell my students
skepticism is healthy. Right?

12:08.303 --> 12:10.228
If people have questions
about what happened,

12:10.379 --> 12:12.472
I want to try
to answer them.

12:12.548 --> 12:14.149
With facts.

12:15.126 --> 12:16.651
With proof.

12:19.388 --> 12:22.323
Shouldn't we at least try?

12:25.487 --> 12:27.320
- I gotta admit...

12:28.139 --> 12:32.141
...I've been a junkie
for that conspiracy stuff
for as long as I can remember.

12:32.160 --> 12:35.736
Info Wars, Pizzagate,
you name it.

12:36.648 --> 12:40.650
I always figured, if there's
smoke there's fire, right?

12:40.652 --> 12:44.596
All fun and games till it's your
kid that's dead and buried.

12:45.673 --> 12:47.824
- Maybe Laura's right then.

12:47.842 --> 12:50.510
- You can't engage with trolls.

12:50.586 --> 12:52.086
They're cowards.

12:52.105 --> 12:53.846
Hiding behind a screen.

12:53.999 --> 12:56.441
- So what if we do it in person?

12:57.426 --> 13:00.003
I want them to look me
in the eye

13:00.021 --> 13:03.172
and tell me
that my son wasn't real.

13:03.174 --> 13:06.326
(soft music)

13:08.104 --> 13:11.998
(indistinct chatter)

13:17.130 --> 13:19.856
Has Gillian texted you?
(beeping)

13:19.874 --> 13:21.448
- They're not coming.

13:21.468 --> 13:23.968
Damnit.
- It's already ten after.

13:24.120 --> 13:25.804
- Okay. Okay.

13:25.880 --> 13:27.639
- You sure?
- Yeah.

13:28.366 --> 13:29.957
Hi, hi.

13:30.035 --> 13:31.625
Thank you all for coming.

13:31.870 --> 13:36.180
I know some of you have...
have travelled
quite a distance to be here.

13:36.483 --> 13:40.134
My name is Laura Broder.
This is my husband Eric.

13:40.987 --> 13:45.156
Our son Liam...
was one of the victims.

13:45.233 --> 13:47.567
This is Molly and Ben
Greenfield.

13:47.643 --> 13:49.994
Their daughter Allison
was also murdered.

13:51.056 --> 13:55.575
I know that there have been
a lot of theories
and misinformation online.

13:55.727 --> 13:59.896
I have brought evidence
of Liam's entire life.

13:59.914 --> 14:04.592
I have a hard copy
of his death certificate
if you want to see it.

14:05.995 --> 14:07.679
(sighs)

14:07.830 --> 14:09.764
Sorry, um...

14:10.851 --> 14:12.517
You know what?

14:12.668 --> 14:16.688
Any questions you have,
we'll... we'll just do our best
to answer.

14:18.266 --> 14:19.916
- Why were there no helicopters?

14:19.934 --> 14:23.177
Nine kids bleeding out and
no trauma helicopters called?

14:23.196 --> 14:25.755
- So the nearest hospital,
Lehigh Valley,

14:25.848 --> 14:27.273
they don't have helicopters.

14:27.350 --> 14:29.609
The ambulances were
on their way within minutes.

14:29.761 --> 14:32.111
Helicopters were called
when three of the victims

14:32.188 --> 14:34.113
needed to be transferred
to Chestnut Hill.

14:34.766 --> 14:36.766
- Why aren't you suing
the first responders?

14:36.784 --> 14:38.877
I read
it took them over an hour.

14:38.953 --> 14:41.604
- That's, that's not true.
They were here a lot faster
than that.

14:41.606 --> 14:43.548
And in, you know,
in Liam's case, for example,

14:43.699 --> 14:45.550
there's nothing
that could have been done so.

14:45.701 --> 14:48.778
- I'll be honest, I have
three of my own and...

14:48.871 --> 14:52.098
it feels like a new one
of these happen every week.

14:52.967 --> 14:54.951
And how can that be?

14:54.953 --> 14:57.061
How...

14:57.972 --> 15:00.047
Are there really
this many sickos

15:00.066 --> 15:03.884
who wanna pump bullets
into a bunch of kids, I just...

15:03.962 --> 15:07.130
I, I, I can't imagine it.

15:07.148 --> 15:09.482
- Yeah.
It's unimaginable.

15:09.634 --> 15:12.744
- Uh, what about
your maiden name?

15:12.895 --> 15:14.153
- Sorry?

15:14.305 --> 15:16.063
- Hi, Joanna Lynn Pierce.

15:16.082 --> 15:18.399
Executive reporter
for The Daily Inquest.

15:18.418 --> 15:22.069
Your maiden name.
Birkheimer, right?

15:22.088 --> 15:24.480
(clears throat)
- That's right.

15:24.482 --> 15:26.791
- You expect us to believe
that

15:26.867 --> 15:32.413
it's just a coincidence that
there's a Swedish lobbyist
named Laura Birkheimer

15:32.490 --> 15:36.342
who tried to outlaw firearms
in three European countries?

15:36.494 --> 15:37.769
(crowd whispers)

15:37.996 --> 15:40.271
- Uh, well,
I was born in Scranton.

15:40.423 --> 15:42.181
So, I can show you my passport.

15:42.333 --> 15:44.425
- Oh well,
passports can be faked.

15:44.444 --> 15:46.444
Let's see the room
where it happened.

15:46.595 --> 15:50.097
- I actually tried to get access
but the local police
wouldn't allow it.

15:50.116 --> 15:51.524
- Oh, and why is that, I wonder.

15:51.676 --> 15:54.844
I hear they're planning
to tear the whole thing down.

15:54.862 --> 15:58.039
What are they afraid
we'll find?

15:59.033 --> 16:01.442
- It's the site
of a mass murder.

16:01.519 --> 16:04.128
Where... where my son was killed
and eight...

16:04.355 --> 16:06.297
- Except he wasn't really
your son, was he?

16:06.449 --> 16:08.299
- Excuse me?
- Excuse me?

16:08.451 --> 16:09.950
- Do you have his adoption
papers in that box?

16:09.970 --> 16:11.694
- I'm sorry.
Excuse me.

16:11.787 --> 16:14.714
What the hell does his adoption
have to do with him
being murdered?

16:14.866 --> 16:17.124
- I'm just asking questions
here. You never wanted
your own?

16:17.143 --> 16:19.435
- They are my own.

16:20.313 --> 16:22.872
I have cervical stenosis.

16:22.890 --> 16:24.965
I had three miscarriages,

16:24.985 --> 16:26.633
the last one put me
in a hospital.

16:26.653 --> 16:28.802
Would you like to see
my medical records?

16:28.822 --> 16:30.896
- I would like to see
the coroner's report.

16:31.049 --> 16:32.548
Why was that never released?

16:32.567 --> 16:34.066
- Oh, for God's sake,
why the hell do you think?

16:34.219 --> 16:35.401
- Okay, Ben,
maybe we should go.

16:35.553 --> 16:37.478
- If you want us to believe
these kids are dead,

16:37.497 --> 16:38.812
let's see...
let's just see some proof.

16:38.890 --> 16:40.223
- You know what?
- Have some respect!

16:40.241 --> 16:41.648
- We're done here.
- They're already
in the ground.

16:41.817 --> 16:43.817
- Oh, well,
isn't that convenient?
- This is pointless.

16:43.895 --> 16:45.895
- How do you people
sleep at night?
- Let's go. Let's go.

16:45.913 --> 16:47.747
- Oh yeah, go, go.
Run. Run.

16:47.841 --> 16:51.584
Take your dirty money, get back
on that plane to Switzerland.
How 'bout that?

16:52.328 --> 16:55.421
- I'm sorry,
don't you mean Sweden?

16:55.573 --> 16:56.681
- Laura.

16:56.832 --> 16:59.258
- Because Swedish lobbyists
come from Sweden.

16:59.410 --> 17:00.743
- Oh, thank you, professor.

17:00.762 --> 17:04.263
Some of us didn't have
the luxury of a fancy education.

17:04.340 --> 17:06.766
But we're not suckers.

17:06.842 --> 17:08.084
We have eyes.

17:08.086 --> 17:09.935
We can see.

17:10.012 --> 17:12.363
You hear me?

17:13.591 --> 17:15.575
Did you get that?

17:19.447 --> 17:21.280
- No, I, I understand
there are protocols,

17:21.357 --> 17:22.689
but these people are insane.

17:22.767 --> 17:25.935
I mean, they're coming after me
any way they can.

17:25.953 --> 17:27.787
My inbox is a mountain
of hate mail

17:27.863 --> 17:31.215
and... and Eric has had to take
down his Yelp page altogether.

17:31.367 --> 17:33.885
This is clearly more
of the same.

17:33.961 --> 17:35.720
(phone beeping)

17:37.373 --> 17:41.059
Simon, uh, it's my husband.
I need to call you back.

17:41.210 --> 17:42.894
(line ringing)
<i> Hey.</i>

17:43.045 --> 17:44.787
<i> You're not gonna believe this.</i>
- Laura? Listen.

17:44.789 --> 17:47.231
- Someone filed an anonymous
sexual harassment complaint.

17:47.383 --> 17:50.717
<i> And the dean says he needs</i>
<i>to open a Title 9 investigation.</i>

17:50.737 --> 17:52.628
- Laura, you need to come home.
- What?

17:52.630 --> 17:54.814
- They published our address
on 4chan.

17:54.890 --> 17:57.108
Along with our cell numbers,
and your social security.

17:57.260 --> 18:00.244
- Wait...
(scoffs)
Wait, hold on.

18:00.396 --> 18:02.321
<i> - I already got Jonah</i>
<i> out of school.</i>

18:02.398 --> 18:04.565
<i> You just get home</i>
<i> as soon as you can, okay?</i>

18:04.584 --> 18:05.732
<i> And be safe.</i>

18:05.901 --> 18:08.235
<i> (man on the phone):</i>
<i> You better stay alert.</i>

18:08.254 --> 18:10.313
<i> 'Cause we're gonna find you</i>
<i> wherever you go.</i>

18:10.315 --> 18:13.091
<i> We're gonna get you.</i>
<i> You and your fake kid.</i>

18:13.167 --> 18:15.259
- And this happened one time?

18:15.336 --> 18:16.836
- 5:37.

18:16.912 --> 18:19.488
- The number was blocked but
maybe there's a way to trace it?

18:19.507 --> 18:21.657
- It's obviously
Joanna Lynn Pierce.

18:21.659 --> 18:23.584
- Who?
- Oh, she's this lunatic
conspiracist.

18:23.661 --> 18:25.586
- One of these crazy
Park Ridge hoaxers.

18:25.663 --> 18:27.496
- We... we pissed her off

18:27.515 --> 18:29.849
and now we're being targeted
by her army of trolls.

18:30.001 --> 18:31.167
Here.

18:31.185 --> 18:32.593
"Die bitch.

18:32.612 --> 18:35.020
Hope you boil in feces."

18:35.598 --> 18:37.097
She's all over YouTube.

18:37.117 --> 18:40.743
She's been screaming about us
for weeks.

18:43.698 --> 18:45.514
- We'll look into it.

18:45.516 --> 18:47.350
And we'll take your phone
as well.

18:47.368 --> 18:49.460
See if anything on it
we can trace.

18:50.630 --> 18:53.205
In the meantime,
do you have anywhere to stay?

18:53.358 --> 18:56.092
Any family in the area?

19:10.132 --> 19:12.525
- It's just a few nights, okay?

19:13.987 --> 19:15.611
(Laura sighs)
Okay, bud?

19:25.223 --> 19:27.498
- I'm sorry, okay?

19:30.986 --> 19:33.004
What do I need to say it?

19:33.155 --> 19:34.505
Obviously you were right.

19:34.657 --> 19:38.092
- Well, we need to just focus
on what's next, right?

19:41.014 --> 19:43.255
Maybe we go to Baltimore

19:43.332 --> 19:45.257
and stay with my parents.

19:45.410 --> 19:48.019
I can call uh, Furman Templeton,

19:48.095 --> 19:52.264
it's a great public school,
we could see if they'd take
Jonah as a midyear transfer.

19:52.358 --> 19:54.250
- Wait, you mean like
go for good?

19:54.343 --> 19:55.676
Just like that?

19:55.753 --> 19:58.421
- I want us to be safe, Lo.
- No, of course, but...

19:58.439 --> 20:01.365
- And honestly maybe Jonah could
use a... a fresh start.

20:01.517 --> 20:02.925
- What about his friends?

20:02.944 --> 20:04.610
His life?

20:05.596 --> 20:08.355
Not to mention,
you can work from anywhere.

20:08.433 --> 20:10.190
I can't.
I'm on a tenure track.

20:10.284 --> 20:12.284
- I'm not pretending
any of this is easy, okay?

20:12.361 --> 20:14.787
Maybe you could take
a sabbatical.

20:14.881 --> 20:16.956
Maybe you could use it.

20:17.108 --> 20:18.216
(scoffs)

20:19.034 --> 20:22.127
- I'm getting pretty sick
of people telling me
how to grieve.

20:22.204 --> 20:23.946
I don't need that from you.

20:23.965 --> 20:25.765
- Okay.

20:28.728 --> 20:29.894
- Hey.

20:29.971 --> 20:31.211
- Hey.

20:31.231 --> 20:32.396
- I brought coffee.

20:32.473 --> 20:34.715
- Oh, you didn't have
to do that.

20:35.401 --> 20:38.402
We've got new numbers,
new cellphones.

20:38.554 --> 20:41.480
We got a new PO Box.
Different names.

20:41.557 --> 20:43.557
- I'm so sorry.

20:44.135 --> 20:46.469
- You said you wanted to talk?

20:46.988 --> 20:49.205
(sighs)
- Right. Um...

20:49.916 --> 20:51.707
It's about the group.

20:53.327 --> 20:55.902
Some of the other parents,
they'd, um...

20:56.497 --> 20:59.331
they'd rather
you and Eric stop coming.

20:59.408 --> 21:01.074
(scoffs)

21:01.094 --> 21:03.261
I think it's despicable,
honestly.

21:03.412 --> 21:05.504
I, I think they're just afraid,
is all.

21:05.656 --> 21:08.081
They're... they're scared
of becoming targets.

21:08.101 --> 21:09.842
- Yeah. Right.

21:09.994 --> 21:11.435
We're, uh...

21:11.512 --> 21:13.178
we're radioactive.

21:13.331 --> 21:15.347
- You know, we probably
won't keep going.

21:15.441 --> 21:17.833
Ben hates
all the New Age-y talk.

21:18.111 --> 21:19.944
And the coffee tastes
like dirt.

21:20.021 --> 21:22.029
I'm sorry.

21:23.783 --> 21:27.768
- You know we were only gonna
adopt one originally

21:27.787 --> 21:30.195
and then we found out
that Liam had an older brother

21:30.348 --> 21:34.283
who was two years older
and he also needed a home.

21:34.943 --> 21:36.943
And that felt better.

21:38.022 --> 21:41.465
Knowing that they'd
always have each other.

22:12.890 --> 22:15.224
(engine roaring)

22:15.226 --> 22:16.742
(tires screeching)

22:16.836 --> 22:18.586
Hey!
(Jonah grunts)

22:22.233 --> 22:24.592
(tires screeching)

22:27.496 --> 22:30.014
(panting)

22:35.079 --> 22:37.063
- What the hell happened?

22:38.191 --> 22:39.857
Hey, Jonah!
Talk to me.

22:39.934 --> 22:42.860
What happened?
- Why'd she have to go on TV
in the first place?

22:43.011 --> 22:45.196
You knew it was a mistake!

22:45.865 --> 22:48.257
And... and you let her do it
anyway.

22:48.275 --> 22:50.593
And now they're never
gonna stop. Ever.

22:50.595 --> 22:52.018
- You're safe.
- No.

22:52.096 --> 22:53.278
- Do you hear me?
- No.

22:53.355 --> 22:56.022
- Look at me. You're safe.
We'll keep you safe.

22:56.100 --> 22:58.042
- How?

23:00.938 --> 23:02.755
(crying)

23:10.948 --> 23:13.707
- We've sent the vehicle
description out to every
precinct in the county.

23:13.784 --> 23:15.876
- It's harder
without plates but...
- What about Joanna Pierce?

23:15.895 --> 23:17.953
- There's no evidence to suggest
she was directly involved.

23:17.955 --> 23:21.232
- If it wasn't her at the wheel,
it was someone
doing her bidding.

23:21.308 --> 23:23.175
She has thousands of followers

23:23.327 --> 23:24.718
and her rhetoric is
only escalating.

23:24.795 --> 23:27.129
- Has she made any specific
threats of violence?

23:27.148 --> 23:28.464
- She's calling us Satanists

23:28.466 --> 23:30.816
and pedophiles
who deserve to be lynched.

23:30.968 --> 23:33.244
- What about stationing
someone outside our place?

23:33.395 --> 23:35.246
In case they doxx us again?

23:35.322 --> 23:37.139
- We just don't have
the manpower.

23:37.158 --> 23:39.232
I'm sorry.
(scoffs)

23:39.252 --> 23:41.477
Do you have any kind
of home defense?

23:41.479 --> 23:44.163
- What do you mean?
- I mean do you have a gun?

23:44.315 --> 23:47.466
Because if I were you--
- That's not happening.

23:48.094 --> 23:50.428
Thank you, officer.

23:52.098 --> 23:54.432
- Come on. Let's go.

23:54.508 --> 23:56.842
Uh, Jonah, just hang here
for a second, would ya?

23:56.994 --> 23:58.978
Laura, hey.

24:01.774 --> 24:04.257
We have to get out of town.
- Eric.

24:04.335 --> 24:05.517
- I mean it.

24:05.594 --> 24:08.279
- Okay, how is that going
to make any difference?

24:08.355 --> 24:10.764
What is to stop them from
finding us wherever we go?

24:10.841 --> 24:13.951
I'm not gonna start
living like a fugitive.

24:14.028 --> 24:15.786
That means they win.

24:15.938 --> 24:17.846
- They've already won!

24:17.940 --> 24:19.940
My God, Laura, look at us.

24:19.959 --> 24:21.775
- This is our home.

24:21.794 --> 24:23.777
This is our community.

24:23.796 --> 24:26.780
- Yeah, and our community hates
us, in case you haven't noticed.

24:26.799 --> 24:28.615
They think it's our fault

24:28.634 --> 24:31.302
that these yahoos are
showing up in droves,

24:31.378 --> 24:33.304
demanding information
at City Hall.

24:33.455 --> 24:35.789
- We were just trying
to give them answers.

24:35.866 --> 24:37.475
- I'm not saying it's fair.

24:37.626 --> 24:39.793
But this is the reality.

24:40.646 --> 24:43.555
And honestly did you really
think we'd stay here forever?

24:44.208 --> 24:46.484
After everything
that's happened?

24:50.472 --> 24:53.282
- It's where
we've built our lives.

24:53.993 --> 24:56.368
It's where Liam's buried.

24:57.980 --> 25:01.624
What are we supposed to do?
Just leave him?

25:02.317 --> 25:04.393
- I'm sorry, honey.

25:05.229 --> 25:09.131
But we have to be smart.
We're not safe here.

25:10.325 --> 25:12.009
(inhales shakily)
- Okay.

25:12.160 --> 25:13.736
(sniffling)

25:13.754 --> 25:14.920
Okay.

25:15.072 --> 25:16.496
I'll take a leave.

25:16.574 --> 25:17.923
And you, uh,

25:18.351 --> 25:21.744
you call Furman Templeton
and see if they have a spot
for Jonah and...

25:21.762 --> 25:24.930
and we'll just put the house
on the market next week.

25:25.024 --> 25:27.766
I don't... it's gonna take us
a while to pack everything.

25:27.918 --> 25:29.735
- We'll figure it out.

25:34.867 --> 25:36.450
- Okay.

25:37.352 --> 25:38.702
Okay.

25:40.731 --> 25:42.623
Jonah.

26:04.972 --> 26:07.106
(beeping)

26:13.130 --> 26:16.073
(dramatic music)

26:25.918 --> 26:27.492
(door creaking)
- Oh.

26:27.645 --> 26:29.235
(Jonah): Hey.
- Hey.

26:29.255 --> 26:31.814
I didn't know you were home.

26:31.832 --> 26:33.424
Just puttin' stuff away.
What's up?

26:33.575 --> 26:36.318
- Sorry, I,
I was looking for Mom.

26:36.837 --> 26:39.655
- Your mom, uh... I think
she was taking the trash out.

26:39.657 --> 26:42.916
- Yeah, we were, uh...
we were gonna go get pancakes
at Millie's.

26:42.935 --> 26:44.176
- Oh, yeah?

26:44.328 --> 26:47.146
That's a great idea.
- Hey.

26:48.924 --> 26:50.757
Hey, you ready to go?

26:50.776 --> 26:52.759
- Yeah.
You wanna come?

26:52.778 --> 26:55.613
- Oh, I was
thinking maybe just us?

26:55.764 --> 26:57.172
Is that okay?

26:57.191 --> 26:59.491
- Yeah, I ate.
You guys go have fun.

27:07.201 --> 27:09.335
(door banging shut)

27:17.194 --> 27:20.787
- Are they gonna arrest her?

27:20.865 --> 27:22.455
Joanna Pierce.

27:22.475 --> 27:24.516
- I don't know.

27:26.962 --> 27:28.812
It's complicated.

27:28.964 --> 27:31.231
- It doesn't really seem fair.

27:32.485 --> 27:36.545
I mean, why are we the ones
who have to leave?

27:36.547 --> 27:40.532
We're not the ones
telling lies.
- I know.

27:47.500 --> 27:51.226
Look, I... I know that
I haven't been...

27:51.245 --> 27:54.046
me since he died.

27:56.734 --> 28:01.178
Sometimes I'll look at you
and I... I'm just I'm so scared.

28:01.329 --> 28:04.473
I'm scared
I'm gonna lose you too.

28:07.261 --> 28:10.062
But... I, I'm trying.
I really am.

28:13.083 --> 28:16.026
- I know, Mom.

28:16.862 --> 28:20.572
(horn tooting)

28:33.028 --> 28:35.337
(crowd chanting)

28:37.608 --> 28:39.942
- What the hell.
- What's going on?

28:39.944 --> 28:41.777
- No more lies!

28:41.795 --> 28:43.278
No more lies!

28:43.297 --> 28:44.947
No more lies!
- Wait, that's her.

28:44.965 --> 28:47.449
- Mom.
What are you doing?

28:47.468 --> 28:50.877
(crowd chanting): No more lies!
No more lies!

28:50.896 --> 28:52.730
- Stay in the car.
- Mom.

28:52.806 --> 28:53.972
- No more lies!

28:54.124 --> 28:55.624
<i> (Joanna): We want you</i>
<i> to be honest.</i>
- Mom!

28:55.626 --> 28:57.884
<i> - You can't tear down</i>
<i> this building.</i>

28:57.978 --> 28:59.069
(Laura): Stay in the car.

28:59.221 --> 29:01.238
<i> - That's destruction</i>
<i> of evidence.</i>

29:01.431 --> 29:04.241
(crowd): No more lies.
- No more lies.

29:04.318 --> 29:09.079
- No more lies!
No more lies! No more lies!

29:09.156 --> 29:11.473
<i> (Joanna): No more lies.</i>

29:12.643 --> 29:15.085
- Liam wasn't enough for you?
- Don't you come at me.

29:15.162 --> 29:16.587
- You had to come
after Jonah too?

29:16.663 --> 29:17.829
- She's assaulting me!

29:18.073 --> 29:20.332
- You're sick, you know that?
- No, you are sick.

29:20.484 --> 29:22.317
You think you're untouchable,
but you know what?

29:22.336 --> 29:23.761
I don't care what they pay you.
We will find you.

29:23.837 --> 29:25.411
- You say you care
about children?

29:25.580 --> 29:27.747
Stay away from my family,
you hear me,
or I'll have you arrested.

29:27.767 --> 29:31.101
- You can't hide
from the truth.
- No more lies!

29:31.178 --> 29:33.011
- No more lies!

29:33.163 --> 29:34.212
No more lies!

29:34.364 --> 29:36.014
- Press charges against
that bitch.

29:36.091 --> 29:39.184
- No more lies!
No more lies!...

29:39.261 --> 29:42.738
(crowd continues chanting)

29:51.181 --> 29:53.031
- Laura Broder?

29:53.183 --> 29:55.125
(metal door opening)

29:56.111 --> 29:58.086
Come with me.

30:03.193 --> 30:05.210
And I have to give you this.

30:05.362 --> 30:08.288
Ms. Pierce has filed a temporary
order of protection.

30:08.307 --> 30:12.534
You must stay at least 500 feet
away from her person
and place of residence.

30:12.536 --> 30:14.052
You understand?

30:14.129 --> 30:16.730
- Yeah.
- You're free to go.

30:22.637 --> 30:23.654
- C'mon.

30:24.882 --> 30:27.473
- Is it fair to say that
Ms. Pierce was afraid of you?

30:27.551 --> 30:30.661
After you
physically assaulted her?

30:31.388 --> 30:33.738
- I can't know what was going
through her mind.

30:33.891 --> 30:38.151
- But you understood the terms
of the restraining order, yes?

30:38.245 --> 30:41.046
They were fully
explained to you?

30:43.917 --> 30:47.344
Ms. Broder?
- Yes, I understood.

30:47.462 --> 30:50.739
- And yet three weeks later,
you showed up at her property.

30:50.741 --> 30:53.575
- And I take
full responsibility for that.
It was stupid.

30:53.577 --> 30:58.263
It was reckless.
But I... I never intended
to harm Ms. Pierce.

30:58.340 --> 31:01.099
- You can see
why that's hard to believe.

31:01.251 --> 31:03.569
Given you brought a gun?

31:10.018 --> 31:12.293
- What is this?

31:13.188 --> 31:18.542
The State of Illinois says
your application for a firearms
license is approved?

31:21.881 --> 31:24.047
Is this for real?

31:27.202 --> 31:29.553
- - It's locked up, okay?
It's safe.

31:29.630 --> 31:31.704
- You've already bought it?

31:31.782 --> 31:33.965
- Listen to me, the cop...
- How could you do that?

31:34.118 --> 31:36.042
- Okay, look, just calm down.
- Without even consulting me?

31:36.061 --> 31:38.970
- It's locked up okay?
Listen to me.
- You went behind my back.

31:39.047 --> 31:42.048
After everything I've been doing
to stop the proliferation
of guns.

31:42.067 --> 31:44.309
- We've been threatened, Laura.
Okay?

31:44.461 --> 31:47.053
And our principles aren't gonna
keep us safe

31:47.072 --> 31:48.906
when one of them shows up
at our doorstep.

31:49.057 --> 31:50.890
- Safe?
Are you kidding me?

31:50.968 --> 31:52.558
This is what killed our son.

31:52.636 --> 31:54.894
And you think hiding
a loaded weapon in our home

31:54.914 --> 31:56.655
without...
without even telling me.

31:56.898 --> 31:59.658
- This isn't our home!
We had to leave our home
because you wouldn't listen.

31:59.734 --> 32:02.994
I told you, talking
to those freaks was a mistake.

32:03.071 --> 32:06.314
I told you that we should get
out of town the minute
they found our address.

32:06.316 --> 32:07.758
- Yes and we're leaving.
- Yeah.

32:07.985 --> 32:10.335
After Jonah got assaulted,
which should
never have happened!

32:10.412 --> 32:11.670
- Oh, that's my fault too?

32:11.764 --> 32:14.172
- Now, just when I think
you're listening to reason,

32:14.324 --> 32:15.507
you go and attack this woman

32:15.659 --> 32:18.160
and put a... a bigger target
on us, and for what?

32:18.162 --> 32:19.494
This endless crusade!

32:19.496 --> 32:22.922
- How about for Liam?
- This is not about Liam.

32:23.000 --> 32:24.182
It's not.

32:24.334 --> 32:26.735
It's about you
needing an enemy.

32:28.614 --> 32:31.022
- I've made mistakes, Eric,

32:31.175 --> 32:33.599
but I would never go
behind your back.

32:33.677 --> 32:38.196
You wanna pack up the car
and leave tonight? Fine.

32:38.290 --> 32:40.457
But we are getting rid
of that gun.

32:40.534 --> 32:42.417
Do you hear me?

32:43.203 --> 32:45.462
Tell me where it is.

32:50.377 --> 32:51.784
- I locked it.

32:51.804 --> 32:53.378
I know I did.

32:53.455 --> 32:54.787
Jonah?

32:54.807 --> 32:56.598
Jonah?

32:59.311 --> 33:00.885
He's gone.
His window's open.

33:01.038 --> 33:03.397
Why would he take that?

33:04.466 --> 33:07.300
- Her address.
- What are you doing?

33:07.319 --> 33:09.736
- The restraining order.
It was here.

33:11.156 --> 33:15.033
(phone buzzing)

33:22.835 --> 33:24.409
<i> (line ringing)</i>
<i> - Hello?</i>

33:24.486 --> 33:27.428
- Jonah?
Oh, my God. Where are you?

33:27.430 --> 33:29.322
- Uh.
<i> - Listen to me.</i>

33:29.399 --> 33:31.750
Whatever you're doing,
you need to stop.

33:31.902 --> 33:34.011
- That's okay.
It's fine.

33:34.087 --> 33:36.254
I'll... I'll eat
when I get home.

33:36.331 --> 33:39.349
- What?
Jonah, talk to me.

33:39.542 --> 33:41.092
Talk to me.

33:41.245 --> 33:42.853
What are you doing?

33:42.929 --> 33:45.247
- I love you.
- Jonah!

33:45.249 --> 33:49.860
- I brought the gun
for protection
but I never intended to use it.

33:49.936 --> 33:52.771
I just wanted to talk to her.

33:52.923 --> 33:56.033
I, I wanted
all of this to stop.

34:01.206 --> 34:04.458
(music coming
from inside the house)

34:19.783 --> 34:22.650
(Joanna singing)

34:22.652 --> 34:26.688
(dog whimpering)
- Oh, will you stop
your whining.

34:27.900 --> 34:30.358
(singing continues)

34:44.249 --> 34:47.976
(dog whimpering and yelping)

34:47.994 --> 34:50.378
- Shh. Shh.

34:50.923 --> 34:52.905
(music stops)

34:52.999 --> 34:54.983
Here baby.

34:55.001 --> 34:56.484
Here you go.

34:56.486 --> 34:59.387
(dog barking)

35:17.098 --> 35:20.117
(yelping and barking)

35:28.352 --> 35:31.419
(dog continues barking)

35:32.356 --> 35:35.948
Ah! Oh!
Oh, my God.

35:35.968 --> 35:40.971
Oh, my God, you're...
you're the Broder kid.

35:42.349 --> 35:45.183
What are you doing here, honey?

35:45.793 --> 35:47.727
What's going on?

35:48.981 --> 35:50.889
Are they hurting you?

35:51.708 --> 35:54.734
You can tell me.
You can tell me the truth.

35:56.062 --> 35:58.363
I can help you.

36:02.052 --> 36:04.161
(dog barking)

36:05.998 --> 36:08.498
(gunshot)

36:11.486 --> 36:13.395
- One last question, Professor.

36:13.413 --> 36:17.507
You placed a call to your son,
Jonah, at 6:49 pm.

36:17.734 --> 36:21.236
Less than an hour before
you showed up
at the victim's home.

36:21.254 --> 36:24.472
What did you two discuss?

36:28.187 --> 36:29.835
- I don't think he answered.

36:29.855 --> 36:31.730
- He did actually.

36:34.359 --> 36:37.085
The phone call lasted
38 seconds.

36:37.103 --> 36:39.362
- Objection, Your Honor.
Relevance?

36:39.439 --> 36:42.991
- Goes to the defendant's
state of mind.

36:45.095 --> 36:46.995
(Laura): Jonah?

36:48.098 --> 36:49.706
Jonah?

36:49.783 --> 36:51.666
(Eric): Jonah?

36:54.379 --> 36:56.087
- Jonah...

36:56.957 --> 36:59.049
...give me the gun.

37:02.796 --> 37:04.429
- Hey.

37:04.890 --> 37:06.114
You okay?

37:06.132 --> 37:07.465
What happened?

37:07.617 --> 37:10.602
- You need to get him
out of here.

37:12.064 --> 37:14.147
- What are you doing?

37:15.234 --> 37:18.485
What are you doing?
(dialing)

37:20.072 --> 37:22.239
<i> - 911, what's your emergency?</i>

37:22.315 --> 37:25.575
- I need an ambulance.
I just shot someone.

37:29.473 --> 37:32.040
- You did great.
You stayed calm.
You were vulnerable.

37:32.642 --> 37:34.084
- So what now?

37:34.160 --> 37:36.828
- Well, there's one wrinkle.

37:36.980 --> 37:42.241
The ADA's filed a motion
to subpoena Jonah
as a rebuttal witness.

37:42.261 --> 37:43.668
- What?

37:43.762 --> 37:45.153
Why?

37:45.171 --> 37:47.505
- They claim it's about
the mystery phone call,

37:47.657 --> 37:49.766
but frankly I think
they're desperate.

37:49.917 --> 37:52.343
Grilling a traumatized
14-year-old?

37:52.496 --> 37:53.603
Not a good look.

37:53.755 --> 37:55.105
- Jonah can't take the stand.

37:55.181 --> 37:57.423
I mean he can't testify.
I told you that.

37:57.501 --> 37:59.109
I'm not gonna put him
through that.

37:59.185 --> 38:01.427
Can't you block the motion?
- I tried.

38:01.505 --> 38:02.762
The judge shot me down.

38:02.839 --> 38:05.115
Listen, I think
it's a good sign.

38:05.266 --> 38:07.175
It means
they know they're losing.

38:07.193 --> 38:08.768
Otherwise why risk it?

38:09.454 --> 38:12.497
- Is Murder 3
still on the table?

38:13.608 --> 38:15.033
- This is going well.

38:15.185 --> 38:16.942
There's no sign
of forced entry.

38:16.962 --> 38:18.353
Joanna was armed.

38:18.446 --> 38:21.631
They can't prove you weren't
acting in self-defense.

38:22.692 --> 38:24.784
- Can you give us a minute?

38:24.803 --> 38:26.761
Meredith, please?

38:27.973 --> 38:30.623
(door opening, closing)

38:30.700 --> 38:33.868
Jonah can't take the stand.
- What choice do we have?

38:33.887 --> 38:35.370
- I can take the plea.

38:35.372 --> 38:37.372
- You heard
what she just said, right?

38:37.390 --> 38:39.316
There's a good chance that
we could walk away from this.

38:39.467 --> 38:42.819
- No, not if he goes up there.
What if he says something?

38:42.896 --> 38:44.470
- Lo, if you plead guilty,

38:44.489 --> 38:46.714
that's a minimum sentence
of 15 years.

38:46.716 --> 38:49.050
How's Jonah supposed
to live with that?

38:49.719 --> 38:51.828
The lie is eating away at him
already.

38:52.055 --> 38:53.479
- It's not a lie.

38:54.891 --> 38:57.983
It might have been his finger
on the trigger, but
I'm the reason he was there.

38:58.003 --> 38:59.336
You know that.

38:59.412 --> 39:01.671
You know that as well as I do.

39:03.400 --> 39:05.133
(sighs)

39:09.906 --> 39:11.089
(Eric sniffles)

39:11.165 --> 39:13.266
You were right.

39:14.260 --> 39:17.354
I needed an enemy.
I needed a fight.

39:18.523 --> 39:21.691
Because without that,
there was just this...

39:23.103 --> 39:25.653
...giant gaping hole.

39:28.091 --> 39:30.658
I brought us here.
I did that.

39:32.186 --> 39:36.122
And I am not going
to let him pay for that.

39:40.620 --> 39:43.046
We can't lose him too.

39:45.625 --> 39:47.942
(crying softly)
- Oh, God.

39:47.944 --> 39:49.627
- Look at me.

39:49.779 --> 39:52.037
Look at me.
Look at me.

39:52.115 --> 39:54.057
Look at me.

39:55.135 --> 39:57.143
Let me do this.

39:57.896 --> 39:59.729
It's what I want.

40:02.049 --> 40:03.975
You take Jonah

40:04.127 --> 40:07.629
somewhere
that you both can heal.

40:07.647 --> 40:09.555
- I can't.
- Yeah, you can.

40:09.633 --> 40:13.484
You'll be alright and he'll get
through it, he will.

40:13.561 --> 40:15.662
And I'll be okay.

40:16.973 --> 40:18.456
Really.

40:19.901 --> 40:22.143
Good behavior, parole...

40:22.162 --> 40:24.421
it's not so long.

40:26.983 --> 40:29.759
Turtles live 150 years.

40:46.278 --> 40:49.070
<i> - Will the defendant</i>
<i> please rise?</i>

40:51.432 --> 40:53.432
Mrs. Broder,

40:53.434 --> 40:56.344
you understand by entering
this guilty plea

40:56.346 --> 40:58.771
you waive your right
to any future appeal?

40:58.848 --> 41:00.531
- I understand, Your Honor.

41:00.700 --> 41:05.587
- Before the court accepts
your plea, is there anything
you'd like to say?

41:09.968 --> 41:14.804
- When my son Liam was
five years old,

41:14.881 --> 41:19.200
he asked me once,
we were brushing his teeth
and he asked,

41:19.293 --> 41:22.553
"How do we know
we're not puppets?

41:22.706 --> 41:25.565
With someone else
controlling the strings?

41:26.726 --> 41:29.652
How do we know we are real?"

41:32.324 --> 41:35.533
If I could do it again...
(voice breaks)

41:36.978 --> 41:39.311
....I would say to him,

41:40.332 --> 41:44.501
"Maybe we don't know.
Maybe we never can."

41:46.062 --> 41:49.672
But I think maybe we're real

41:50.491 --> 41:54.344
not because of what we know,
but because of who we love.

41:58.850 --> 42:00.499
(trembling breath)

42:01.853 --> 42:08.107
To Ms. Pierce's family
and loved ones,
I am so deeply sorry.

42:11.104 --> 42:13.196
And to my own family,

42:13.347 --> 42:16.449
please know
how much I love you.

42:19.037 --> 42:21.162
And it's okay.

42:29.956 --> 42:32.090
(sobbing)
Thank you.

42:32.792 --> 42:34.384
- Mrs. Broder,

42:34.460 --> 42:38.629
the court formally accepts
your plea of guilty

42:38.782 --> 42:40.631
to murder
in the third degree.

42:40.784 --> 42:44.118
The defendant will be remanded
to custody pending sentencing.

42:44.211 --> 42:46.646
We are now adjourned.

42:53.813 --> 42:55.655
- It's okay.

43:13.666 --> 43:16.718
(crying)
