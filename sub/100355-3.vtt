WEBVTT

00:01.523 --> 00:03.046
- Previously on
"Legends of Tomorrow"...

00:03.090 --> 00:04.352
- If you're seeing this,

00:04.395 --> 00:06.136
we altered my future
at Heyworld.

00:06.180 --> 00:07.790
I don't know where I'll be
or who I'll be, but find me.

00:07.833 --> 00:09.661
- John, wait!
- Masher?

00:09.705 --> 00:13.187
Has Astra released the worst
souls from Hell onto Earth?

00:13.230 --> 00:14.797
- I'm unkillable!

00:18.192 --> 00:19.367
- I'm putting an end to this.

00:19.410 --> 00:20.803
- Are you trying
to go back to Hell?

00:20.846 --> 00:23.197
- I'll return when the sigil
is complete.

00:26.765 --> 00:32.597
♪ Time is breaking up
my soul ♪

00:32.641 --> 00:37.515
♪ It's using it to mold

00:37.559 --> 00:41.128
♪ It's so, oh, oh

00:41.171 --> 00:43.739
- Ma'am, we caught him
lurking outside.

00:46.220 --> 00:48.091
- It seems you're having
a hard time

00:48.135 --> 00:49.919
staying away from Hell
these days, John.

00:49.962 --> 00:53.183
- Well, what can I say,
I'm a creature of habit.

00:53.227 --> 00:54.663
- You might as well
get used to it.

00:54.706 --> 00:56.752
You'll be living down here
soon enough.

00:57.840 --> 00:59.233
What do you want?

00:59.276 --> 01:01.670
- A whiskey, neat,
and a steak, well done.

01:01.713 --> 01:04.238
Oh, yeah, and all those souls
you released.

01:04.281 --> 01:05.369
Call 'em back.

01:05.413 --> 01:07.545
Look, there is enough evil
on Earth

01:07.589 --> 01:09.895
without you giving the damned
a second chance.

01:09.939 --> 01:14.770
- Those damned souls
are making me rich, John.

01:14.813 --> 01:18.904
Any humans corrupted or killed
by them all belong to me.

01:18.948 --> 01:21.559
And after years of being under
the boot of the Triumvirate,

01:21.603 --> 01:26.086
it sure feels good to grind
my heel on someone else.

01:28.436 --> 01:30.829
- Masher?
- John.

01:32.527 --> 01:33.876
Help me.

01:33.919 --> 01:36.096
- John's better at getting
his friends into trouble

01:36.139 --> 01:37.575
than out of it.

01:37.619 --> 01:40.187
Something you should have known
when you squealed on me.

01:41.405 --> 01:42.798
- You don't have to do this,
Astra.

01:42.841 --> 01:46.149
- I like doing this.

01:46.193 --> 01:48.412
- No more, please.

01:50.327 --> 01:53.287
- Astra, look, I came down here
for a friendly chat, all right?

01:53.330 --> 01:56.246
Now, we don't
have to be enemies.

01:56.290 --> 01:59.423
- You're not my enemy, John.

01:59.467 --> 02:02.600
You're an important step
in my evolution.

02:02.644 --> 02:04.776
I crawled my way up
from the bottom

02:04.820 --> 02:08.258
and I finally have some
real power around here.

02:08.302 --> 02:11.131
So if you want to stop me,

02:11.174 --> 02:13.394
you'll have to kill me.

02:13.437 --> 02:15.744
But really, what's the point?

02:15.787 --> 02:19.748
My soul would just end up
back down here anyway.

02:25.884 --> 02:26.972
- John.

02:28.452 --> 02:30.541
- What happened down there?

02:33.196 --> 02:34.850
- I need a drink.

02:37.896 --> 02:39.289
- No post-mission debrief?

02:39.333 --> 02:41.596
- It's part of his process.

02:42.988 --> 02:44.599
- Come on, Gideon,
play the damn message again.

02:44.642 --> 02:46.644
- You can mistreat me
all you like, Mr. Heywood.

02:46.688 --> 02:48.994
But I assure you,
there are no secret messages

02:49.038 --> 02:51.388
hiding in my memory banks.

02:51.432 --> 02:52.868
- Everything okay, bro?

02:52.911 --> 02:54.130
- Oh, um, yeah.

02:54.174 --> 02:56.132
I was just, uh,
double-checking something.

02:56.176 --> 02:57.655
Little help?

03:05.750 --> 03:07.970
I think I'm starting
to see things.

03:08.013 --> 03:10.015
- I know what's going on.

03:10.059 --> 03:11.191
- You do?

03:11.234 --> 03:12.888
- You get into my stash again?

03:15.804 --> 03:16.761
Dude, no worries.

03:16.805 --> 03:18.241
Sara's gathering the team,
come on.

03:18.285 --> 03:19.503
- Thanks.

03:19.547 --> 03:22.419
- And that is the truth of it,
mateys.

03:22.463 --> 03:26.554
Astra and this whole
bloody mess is on me.

03:26.597 --> 03:28.947
And she can't be reasoned with.

03:28.991 --> 03:31.211
So we need a more permanent
solution to stopping her

03:31.254 --> 03:34.126
or she could continue
releasing souls indefinitely.

03:34.170 --> 03:35.519
- Surely, Astra can change.

03:35.563 --> 03:37.042
She's still human, right?

03:37.086 --> 03:38.783
I mean, even a master
of the dark arts must believe

03:38.827 --> 03:40.916
there's still some good
left in her.

03:40.959 --> 03:42.047
- Forget it, big man.

03:42.091 --> 03:43.875
Astra's lust for power,

03:43.919 --> 03:46.008
it zapped the humanity
out of her.

03:46.051 --> 03:47.575
- Well, on the bright side,

03:47.618 --> 03:50.317
at least the encores aren't
our fault this time.

03:50.360 --> 03:52.057
- Hey, up top.

03:52.101 --> 03:54.886
- Is there any point in sending
these encores to Hell?

03:54.930 --> 03:57.062
It sounds like Astra would just
send them straight back.

03:57.106 --> 03:58.803
- Correct.

03:58.847 --> 04:01.415
- Well, then until we find
a more permanent solution,

04:01.458 --> 04:03.504
we'll house the encores
on the ship.

04:04.461 --> 04:06.507
- We're gonna need
a bigger pantry.

04:24.046 --> 04:25.874
- Hey, Cap.

04:25.917 --> 04:27.876
Normally, I'd be all for
rolling up my sleeves

04:27.919 --> 04:30.052
and pitching in,
but I gotta take shore leave

04:30.095 --> 04:32.663
for my pop's birthday,
and Nate's coming with me.

04:32.707 --> 04:34.491
- I am?
- You are?

04:34.535 --> 04:37.102
- My parents are always asking
questions about my life.

04:37.146 --> 04:39.279
He could pretend to be one
of my biz school professors.

04:41.455 --> 04:42.630
- I still can't believe
that you haven't told

04:42.673 --> 04:44.109
your parents the truth
about what you do.

04:44.153 --> 04:46.155
- You mean that I'm
a time traveling superhero

04:46.198 --> 04:47.417
who stole the family heirloom?

04:47.461 --> 04:50.594
- Hmm, okay, yeah,
stick to business school.

04:50.638 --> 04:51.813
- We'll be back before
you can say "timequake."

04:51.856 --> 04:54.119
- Don't jinx it.

04:54.163 --> 04:55.425
- Too late, Captain,

04:55.469 --> 04:56.818
a new timequake
has been detected.

04:56.861 --> 04:58.689
You are needed on the bridge.

05:00.256 --> 05:01.953
Mm.

05:03.041 --> 05:04.086
What are we looking at?

05:04.129 --> 05:05.870
- Ah, the epicenter
of the timequake

05:05.914 --> 05:07.611
is in Los Angeles, 1947.

05:07.655 --> 05:09.134
- It's the golden age
of Hollywood

05:09.178 --> 05:11.441
and the height
of organized crime in the city.

05:11.485 --> 05:13.008
- The real golden age.

05:13.051 --> 05:16.403
- All right, people, we're
gonna need two teams for the--

05:16.446 --> 05:19.319
Sorry, honey, I think
I'm in your spot, aren't I?

05:19.362 --> 05:21.364
- Hey, don't sweat it, babe.

05:21.408 --> 05:23.932
As Ava was saying,
two teams.

05:23.975 --> 05:25.237
Ray, John, with me.

05:25.281 --> 05:27.370
Mick, Ava, QB from the ship.

05:27.414 --> 05:29.111
Now, let's do it.

05:30.417 --> 05:32.723
- Hmm, you hear that?

05:32.767 --> 05:34.986
It's only my second official
mission with the Legends,

05:35.030 --> 05:36.945
and I'm already being trusted
with the football.

05:36.988 --> 05:38.816
- Really?

05:38.860 --> 05:41.819
QB means staying on the ship
and doing nothing.

05:41.863 --> 05:43.343
- Or it could mean

05:43.386 --> 05:45.910
providing the team
with vital information.

05:46.737 --> 05:48.652
Gideon, pull up
a topographical survey

05:48.696 --> 05:50.915
of the city, please.

05:53.396 --> 05:54.397
- How you feeling?

05:54.441 --> 05:55.485
Great.

05:55.529 --> 05:56.834
I just needed
to get off the ship,

05:56.878 --> 05:57.922
clear my head.

06:10.021 --> 06:12.284
- Guys,
this is Nathaniel Heywood.

06:12.328 --> 06:13.503
He's one of my professors.

06:13.547 --> 06:14.939
- Welcome.
- Thank you.

06:14.983 --> 06:16.419
- Oh, we've never had
a professor over for dinner.

06:16.463 --> 06:17.855
What do you teach?

06:17.899 --> 06:20.205
- Advanced macroeconomics,
behavioral economics--

06:20.249 --> 06:22.338
- Hey, guys.
-  Brace yourself.

06:22.382 --> 06:23.905
- Z here.

06:23.948 --> 06:26.690
So I'm at my parents' house
celebrating my dad's birthday.

06:26.734 --> 06:29.693
After all,
family is everything.

06:31.913 --> 06:33.697
Speaking of which,
it looks like we have

06:33.741 --> 06:35.351
a surprise guest
this year.

06:35.395 --> 06:37.614
My brother, Behrad.

06:37.658 --> 06:38.876
Say hello, B.

06:38.920 --> 06:40.182
- Hi.

06:40.225 --> 06:41.836
- Anyways, guys, I gotta go.

06:41.879 --> 06:45.143
Big love to the Z nation.
Khodafez.

06:47.755 --> 06:49.539
Insert that clip at the end
of the current file.

06:49.583 --> 06:51.062
We'll start cutting tonight.

06:51.106 --> 06:53.108
You two can set up glam
in the bathroom for touch-ups.

06:53.848 --> 06:55.937
Hey, I thought this was
supposed to be a family party.

06:55.980 --> 06:57.417
- Oh, says the woman
who just invited

06:57.460 --> 06:58.940
her 48 million followers
into our house.

06:58.983 --> 07:00.028
- It's 51 million.

07:00.071 --> 07:01.116
Try to keep up.

07:01.159 --> 07:03.553
- Zari, darling,
isn't it marvelous.

07:03.597 --> 07:04.728
Your brother brought home

07:04.772 --> 07:06.687
one of his professors
from grad school.

07:06.730 --> 07:08.906
- Zari, Nate.
Nate, Zari.

07:08.950 --> 07:11.169
- Hi.

07:11.213 --> 07:12.649
- It's you.

07:12.693 --> 07:14.390
I saw the video.

07:14.434 --> 07:16.871
- Oh, thanks for subscribing.

07:16.914 --> 07:18.829
You know, it's the fans
that really make

07:18.873 --> 07:21.136
all the hard work worth it.

07:24.531 --> 07:25.967
What a weirdo.

07:36.717 --> 07:37.674
Yo.

07:37.718 --> 07:38.762
- Your sister is
the secret woman

07:38.806 --> 07:39.981
from the hologram message.

07:40.024 --> 07:41.373
- Secret wha--

07:41.417 --> 07:42.505
- I thought
I was hallucinating,

07:42.549 --> 07:44.072
but Gideon was scrubbing
her memory

07:44.115 --> 07:45.595
and there was a secret message
from your sister

07:45.639 --> 07:47.510
telling me to find her

07:47.554 --> 07:48.946
and she's the reason
I came back.

07:48.990 --> 07:50.731
- Are you having
a psychological break?

07:50.774 --> 07:52.123
- No, I'm being serious.

07:52.167 --> 07:54.604
Remember when we dented
history at Heyworld.

07:57.346 --> 08:00.044
Your sister is the dent.

08:12.361 --> 08:14.842
- The traces of magical energy
lead into this office.

08:14.885 --> 08:17.671
There's an infernal residue
in here.

08:19.150 --> 08:20.369
- Sure is.

08:20.412 --> 08:22.153
Residue of a dead guy.

08:24.634 --> 08:26.593
- Oh, whoa, stand back.

08:30.074 --> 08:31.641
- Ugh.

08:31.685 --> 08:35.515
- The victim was consumed
by ignis inferni.

08:35.558 --> 08:36.994
It's hellfire.

08:37.038 --> 08:39.823
Whoever did this to him
was not of this world.

08:39.867 --> 08:43.174
- Well, looks like
our killer's the encore.

08:43.218 --> 08:44.872
- Bollocks.

08:44.915 --> 08:47.091
Ah, there's the ticket.

08:57.188 --> 08:58.625
- Don't come any closer.

08:58.668 --> 09:00.670
- All right, easy.
You can put the gun down.

09:00.714 --> 09:02.150
We're here to help.

09:02.193 --> 09:03.847
- Where's Webb?

09:03.891 --> 09:07.851
- Uh, we are the "and Moore"
of Webb & Moore.

09:07.895 --> 09:09.897
We work with Moore--Webb.

09:11.246 --> 09:13.030
- You must be Moore.

09:13.074 --> 09:15.380
- Sure, that's me.

09:15.424 --> 09:16.686
Johnny Moore.

09:16.730 --> 09:18.906
Sarah is my secretary
and this fella here--

09:18.949 --> 09:20.603
- Has got a cop face.

09:20.647 --> 09:21.952
- Oh, thank you.

09:21.996 --> 09:23.388
Sergeant Palmer
at your service.

09:23.432 --> 09:25.695
I'm undercover.

09:25.739 --> 09:26.870
- Tell Webb to call me
when he's back.

09:26.914 --> 09:29.046
- He's, uh, on
holiday--vacation,

09:29.090 --> 09:32.572
which leaves me handling
your case, Miss...

09:32.615 --> 09:36.401
Hill, Jeannie Hill.

09:36.445 --> 09:39.056
I hired your partner to
protect me from my boyfriend.

09:39.100 --> 09:40.754
- Oh, well,
you're in good hands, ma'am.

09:40.797 --> 09:42.625
- Oh, give me a break,
Johnny Law.

09:42.669 --> 09:44.409
Half the PD is
in Bugsy's pocket.

09:44.453 --> 09:45.759
- Bugsy as in--

09:45.802 --> 09:47.674
- Benjamin Siegel.

09:47.717 --> 09:49.284
Doesn't like it
when you call him Bugsy.

09:49.327 --> 09:51.591
But here's the kicker,

09:51.634 --> 09:53.244
He died last week.

09:53.288 --> 09:56.247
- And now he's back
from the dead.

09:56.291 --> 09:58.510
- And he's more dangerous
than ever.

10:03.472 --> 10:05.430
He took over a joint
on Sunset Boulevard

10:05.474 --> 10:07.258
called the Blue Iguana.

10:07.302 --> 10:09.826
Playground of gangsters
and the Hollywood elite.

10:09.870 --> 10:12.394
Whatever vice
floats your boat,

10:12.437 --> 10:14.788
that's where you'll find it.

10:17.660 --> 10:18.835
- Ladies and gentlemen,

10:20.707 --> 10:22.578
Welcome to the Blue Iguana.

10:22.622 --> 10:24.754
Now, have fun, I insist.

10:24.798 --> 10:26.626
If you don't,
I just might have to shoot ya.

10:29.367 --> 10:30.673
- Mr. Siegel.

10:30.717 --> 10:33.197
Here, smile for
the camera, Mr. Siegel.

10:44.469 --> 10:46.428
- Just, uh, cleaning up
a little bit of crumbs.

10:46.471 --> 10:48.691
- Please, Ms. Hill, continue.

10:48.735 --> 10:50.606
- I was there
when Bugsy was assassinated

10:50.650 --> 10:51.868
by a mob hit man.

10:51.912 --> 10:52.913
Saw the whole thing.

10:52.956 --> 10:54.654
But then, the very next day,

10:54.697 --> 10:55.959
lover boy shows up
at my doorstep,

10:56.003 --> 10:58.048
takes me to his club
like nothing had happened.

10:58.092 --> 11:00.790
And that's just the biscuit,
here comes the gravy.

11:00.834 --> 11:02.400
He's different now.

11:02.444 --> 11:06.143
More ambitious and fearless.

11:06.187 --> 11:08.842
I wanna leave him but I can't
because I know he'd kill me.

11:09.886 --> 11:11.714
- Look, Ms. Hill,

11:11.758 --> 11:13.324
we can protect you
from your boyfriend.

11:13.368 --> 11:15.370
- But you're gonna need to get
out of town for a few days.

11:15.413 --> 11:17.807
Stay in a motel.
Things could get messy.

11:17.851 --> 11:20.157
- But I don't have any money.

11:20.201 --> 11:22.116
Bugsy takes care of all that.

11:26.903 --> 11:28.731
How can I ever repay you?

11:28.775 --> 11:29.993
- No need to worry about that.

11:30.037 --> 11:32.387
We just wanna make sure
you're safe.

11:33.083 --> 11:37.392
- Secretary Sara, can you show
Ms. Hill the way out?

11:45.835 --> 11:49.143
Oh, she took you
for an easy mark, Raymondo.

11:49.186 --> 11:52.102
- What?
She was absolutely terrified.

11:52.146 --> 11:53.669
- Sara?

11:53.713 --> 11:56.367
- Jury's still out on
the missus, but it sounds like

11:56.411 --> 11:58.543
we need to pay
a visit to the Blue Iguana.

12:12.775 --> 12:14.951
- All right,
this is more like it.

12:14.995 --> 12:16.736
Feels good to be back
in the field.

12:18.912 --> 12:21.305
- Ava, what's your status?

12:21.349 --> 12:22.698
- Uh, beer.

12:22.742 --> 12:24.178
- Rory and I are just
sidling up to the bar now.

12:24.221 --> 12:25.875
We're gonna keep an eye
on things.

12:25.919 --> 12:28.617
I'm seeing two zones of egress.

12:28.660 --> 12:30.010
Back door's a gray zone,

12:30.053 --> 12:32.099
front door's got about
four guys sitting around it,

12:32.142 --> 12:33.535
which, quite frankly,
feels like overkill.

12:33.578 --> 12:34.536
What do you think, Mick?

12:34.579 --> 12:36.451
- I think you need to relax.

12:37.757 --> 12:41.064
- Ray, you ready to grab Bugsy
when he comes out?

12:41.717 --> 12:43.545
- Ready and walking the beat.

12:43.588 --> 12:46.940
Gotta say, feelin'
pretty spiffy in this uniform.

12:47.810 --> 12:50.465
- Bugsy has drawn himself
quite a crowd of ass kissers.

12:50.508 --> 12:52.249
- Yeah, and judging
by the cheap threads

12:52.293 --> 12:55.470
and conservative haircuts,
I'd say they're politicians.

13:00.475 --> 13:03.434
Well, if it isn't
our damsel in distress.

13:03.478 --> 13:05.610
- It's gonna be kinda hard
to protect her from her beau

13:05.654 --> 13:07.177
when she's hanging on his arm.

13:07.221 --> 13:10.050
- I knew it, she's as bent
as a nine-bob note.

13:16.186 --> 13:18.058
- Let's go.

13:20.843 --> 13:22.714
Not so fast, sister.

13:22.758 --> 13:24.151
What happened to getting
out of town?

13:25.413 --> 13:26.936
- You think a cab ride
could get me away

13:26.980 --> 13:28.329
from what Bugsy's got on me?

13:28.372 --> 13:30.418
- You and the rest of town,
by the looks of it.

13:30.461 --> 13:33.725
- Look, ever since
Bugsy came back,

13:33.769 --> 13:37.599
he gets whatever he wants,
and everyone answers to him.

13:37.642 --> 13:39.383
Politicians, studio heads--

13:39.427 --> 13:40.776
- Even the cops.

13:40.820 --> 13:44.301
Then tell me, how'd he get
so much juice so fast?

13:44.345 --> 13:46.826
- By using America's favorite
pastime, of course.

13:46.869 --> 13:48.305
Blackmail.

13:48.349 --> 13:50.264
He's got a secret stash
of compromising photographs

13:50.307 --> 13:51.743
he uses against all of them.

13:51.787 --> 13:52.962
- And what does that
have to do with you?

13:53.006 --> 13:54.137
- Everything.

13:54.181 --> 13:56.879
I'm in those pictures.

13:56.923 --> 14:00.317
Bugsy used me as bait to lure
men and women into his trap.

14:03.625 --> 14:05.757
When I first moved here
from Shaker Heights,

14:05.801 --> 14:07.542
I thought
I was gonna be famous.

14:09.022 --> 14:11.894
And sure,
I became famous all right.

14:11.938 --> 14:14.201
Just not the right kind
of famous.

14:16.507 --> 14:19.728
I can't leave
without those pictures.

14:19.771 --> 14:21.164
Satisfied?

14:22.949 --> 14:25.908
- You know, if Bugsy likes
honey traps so much,

14:25.952 --> 14:28.345
why don't we give him
a taste of his own medicine.

14:57.897 --> 14:59.115
- I couldn't help
but notice you,

14:59.159 --> 15:00.725
and I gotta tell you,

15:00.769 --> 15:02.205
I like the way you walk.

15:02.249 --> 15:04.729
- I learned to do it
all by myself,

15:04.773 --> 15:06.079
Mr. Siegel.

15:06.122 --> 15:08.385
- Oh, please, Benjamin.

15:08.429 --> 15:11.823
- Hmm, Sara Lance,
at your service.

15:11.867 --> 15:13.390
- Lance, huh?

15:13.434 --> 15:15.697
- What's the matter,
you don't like it?

15:15.740 --> 15:18.526
- Well, I don't know yet,
just trying it on for size.

15:18.569 --> 15:19.919
You know, even if it fits,

15:19.962 --> 15:21.529
I'm a little curious
about the price tag.

15:21.572 --> 15:24.836
- Well, if you have to ask,
it's probably too expensive.

15:26.186 --> 15:28.231
I take what I want.

15:28.275 --> 15:31.539
- Does that make you a thief,
Mr. Siegel?

15:32.105 --> 15:35.021
- I am a lot of things,
Ms. Lance.

15:36.239 --> 15:38.763
And I am especially a thief.

15:38.807 --> 15:42.158
- Well, then let's stop
all the tiddlywinks

15:42.202 --> 15:44.726
and get straight
to the big reveal, shall we?

15:44.769 --> 15:47.598
Now, I'm a reporter
for a new gossip rag,

15:47.642 --> 15:50.645
and I've got some dirt
on half the city councilmen

15:50.688 --> 15:52.168
and the new archbishop.

15:52.212 --> 15:53.953
It's in my car.

15:53.996 --> 15:56.129
What do you say we go out back

15:56.172 --> 15:59.915
and you can take a peek
what's in my trunk.

15:59.959 --> 16:03.223
- I say, you keep talking
like that,

16:03.266 --> 16:05.573
I just might follow you
anywhere.

16:10.143 --> 16:11.492
- Ray, I'm outside with--

16:11.535 --> 16:14.799
Benjamin,
car's this way.

16:14.843 --> 16:18.151
- You know, on second thought,
why don't we ditch the club.

16:18.194 --> 16:19.630
How 'bout, you and me,

16:19.674 --> 16:22.024
we go someplace
with a little less company.

16:22.764 --> 16:26.246
- Actually, I think
we already have company.

16:26.289 --> 16:28.813
- Your eyesight's 20/20 doll.

16:28.857 --> 16:30.293
Those are Mickey Cohen's boys.

16:30.337 --> 16:32.121
But after going through Hell,

16:32.165 --> 16:34.123
I ain't afraid of nothing
on this Earth.

16:38.040 --> 16:39.650
You might wanna jump
outta the pot.

16:39.694 --> 16:41.348
Water's about to boil.

17:01.368 --> 17:04.197
- Drop the gun,
put your hands in the air.

17:08.288 --> 17:10.812
- Stand down, son,
we'll take it from here.

17:14.729 --> 17:17.210
- Feels weird to be foiled
by the good guys.

17:17.253 --> 17:19.821
What's the plan B?

17:19.864 --> 17:22.780
- Well, it looks like you're
going downtown, Sergeant.

17:26.741 --> 17:28.569
- Tomorrow is huge.

17:28.612 --> 17:30.484
We're making a line
of dressy sneakers.

17:30.527 --> 17:33.008
It's gonna be so major.
- That's nice, dear.

17:33.052 --> 17:36.011
So, Behrad, any girlfriends
we should know about?

17:36.055 --> 17:38.187
- No, Ma, there's not really
much time for dating,

17:38.231 --> 17:40.059
given all the coursework.

17:40.102 --> 17:42.017
- But you need
to take your nose

17:42.061 --> 17:43.627
out of your books
on occasion.

17:43.671 --> 17:47.327
Otherwise, you'll never find
a nice Persian girl to marry.

17:50.547 --> 17:52.201
Behrad.

17:57.728 --> 17:59.600
- By all means,
add to your entourage.

17:59.643 --> 18:02.037
How much does worshipping you
pay these days?

18:02.081 --> 18:05.127
- My team is
my extended family.

18:05.171 --> 18:06.476
They help me manage
a multi-platform,

18:06.520 --> 18:07.999
multimillion dollar brand,

18:08.043 --> 18:09.871
and I didn't even have to go
to business school.

18:09.914 --> 18:11.394
- Wow.

18:15.790 --> 18:17.313
- Is that the air totem
in the painti--

18:19.228 --> 18:21.752
- Why, yes it is, professor.

18:21.796 --> 18:23.928
How do you know
about our family heirloom?

18:23.972 --> 18:25.582
- Behrad told me.

18:25.626 --> 18:28.237
- Really, what did he tell you
about the air totem?

18:28.281 --> 18:32.676
- Just that I was so broken up
when I found out it was stolen.

18:32.720 --> 18:35.288
- We keep the painting up
as a memento.

18:35.331 --> 18:38.204
Even though it's lost, I feel
like it's still

18:38.247 --> 18:41.032
here with us today,
in this very room.

18:45.646 --> 18:49.215
- So, Sara, do you want us
back at the ship

18:49.258 --> 18:50.390
for a post-mission debrief?

18:50.433 --> 18:52.000
- No, mission ain't over yet.

18:52.043 --> 18:53.958
I need you guys posted
at the club.

18:54.002 --> 18:56.483
Keep your eyes peeled
and your ears open.

18:56.526 --> 18:58.180
- Great.

18:58.224 --> 18:59.268
- What?

18:59.312 --> 19:02.880
- Hmm?

19:02.924 --> 19:04.273
You wouldn't understand.

19:04.317 --> 19:05.448
- That you were the boss

19:05.492 --> 19:07.146
of a massive government
organization,

19:07.189 --> 19:10.018
and now you do diddly-squat.

19:10.061 --> 19:12.194
- Wow, take it back, Rory.

19:12.238 --> 19:14.457
You just summed up my life
perfectly.

19:17.243 --> 19:19.375
Can I get a double?

19:19.419 --> 19:21.812
- Bugsy is gonna be
pretty hard to catch

19:21.856 --> 19:23.640
if he still has that gun.

19:23.684 --> 19:25.468
- Well, we best get our hands
on it pronto

19:25.512 --> 19:27.166
because only a weapon from Hell

19:27.209 --> 19:30.081
can eliminate
a Hell-spawned encore.

19:30.125 --> 19:34.390
And that gun may be useful
in more ways than one.

19:34.434 --> 19:37.306
- Oh, good thing I have
my best man on the job.

19:53.844 --> 19:55.803
- Jeannie was right.

19:55.846 --> 19:58.371
Bugsy really does have
the LAPD in his pocket.

20:00.895 --> 20:03.767
I'm gonna have to figure out
another way to get that gun.

20:06.988 --> 20:09.077
- Can I take those arrest
summaries off your hands?

20:09.120 --> 20:10.644
I'm on my way to records.

20:10.687 --> 20:12.907
- Sure, ah,
that'd be super helpful.

20:12.950 --> 20:14.909
Thanks.

20:16.302 --> 20:17.346
- It's tough to watch
the department

20:17.390 --> 20:19.653
kowtow to a gangster.

20:19.696 --> 20:21.785
- That's exactly
what I was thinking.

20:21.829 --> 20:24.658
- Oh, good cops like you
are hard to find.

20:24.701 --> 20:25.572
Name's Sullivan.

20:25.615 --> 20:28.401
- Palmer, Ray Palmer.

20:28.444 --> 20:30.403
- Well, see you 'round,
Sergeant.

20:31.404 --> 20:34.015
- Officer Sullivan.

20:34.058 --> 20:36.757
Can certainly set your watch
to that fine constable.

20:38.237 --> 20:39.542
- We need a plan B.

20:39.586 --> 20:40.978
If Ray can't get this gun,
the last thing we need

20:41.022 --> 20:43.416
is Bugsy blasting anyone else
out of existence.

20:43.459 --> 20:45.679
- Yeah, well,
maybe a stretch of the old legs

20:45.722 --> 20:47.985
and some fresh air
will give us some clarity.

20:55.341 --> 20:57.952
I think I know how
to get Bugsy's gun.

21:05.046 --> 21:06.874
So you got my message.

21:09.833 --> 21:11.487
- Look, if this is about
the money your friend gave me,

21:11.531 --> 21:12.662
I already spent it.

21:12.706 --> 21:13.837
- I knew you were on the grift

21:13.881 --> 21:15.926
from the moment
I laid eyes on ya.

21:15.970 --> 21:16.884
- And I never once fell

21:16.927 --> 21:18.886
for that Yankee accent
of yours.

21:22.411 --> 21:23.891
Well, all right then.

21:23.934 --> 21:26.415
Well, now that we've dropped
the charades, tell me,

21:26.459 --> 21:27.938
what is your angle?

21:27.982 --> 21:31.855
- I wanna take Bugsy down.
Free this town from his sway.

21:31.899 --> 21:35.337
The only way to do that is
to destroy his blackmail stash.

21:35.381 --> 21:36.773
Webb said he'd found it,
but I'm guessing

21:36.817 --> 21:38.862
Bugsy killed him
for snooping too close.

21:38.906 --> 21:41.343
- Well, that's bad news
for Webb and good news for me,

21:41.387 --> 21:43.040
because I know
where the stash is.

21:43.084 --> 21:47.044
- Well, aren't I the luckiest
girl in the world.

21:48.263 --> 21:49.525
What do you want in exchange?

21:52.180 --> 21:54.138
I want Bugsy's gun.

21:54.182 --> 21:55.749
- You lookin' to ice Bugsy?

21:55.792 --> 21:57.620
- No, that bloke's
not worth it.

21:57.664 --> 22:00.014
I'm aiming at the person
who brought him back.

22:00.057 --> 22:01.624
- Then we have a deal.

22:01.668 --> 22:04.888
You get your guy,
I get my freedom.

22:04.932 --> 22:06.803
- Now, how exactly
are you planning

22:06.847 --> 22:09.850
on stealing Bugsy's
prized weapon, eh?

22:09.893 --> 22:12.592
- When we kiss...

22:12.635 --> 22:15.508
I'll press my hand
against his chest,

22:15.551 --> 22:18.946
and then I'll run my hand
all the way down his body,

22:20.208 --> 22:22.036
and then I'll grab it
like this.

22:36.529 --> 22:38.748
- You wanna know a secret?
- No.

22:38.792 --> 22:41.751
- I just turned in my keys
for my place in D.C.

22:41.795 --> 22:42.796
Yep.

22:42.839 --> 22:44.972
Everything I own is now stuffed

22:45.015 --> 22:47.757
inside a Time Bureau
softball league duffel bag.

22:47.801 --> 22:50.499
I am essentially homeless,
Rory.

22:50.543 --> 22:53.372
- Congratulations,
you're part of the team.

22:53.415 --> 22:57.506
- Uh-uh, I'm a vagrant.
A vagabond.

22:57.550 --> 23:02.032
- Mm, no job,
no rent, no kids.

23:02.076 --> 23:04.470
- Uh-uh.
- Perfect.

23:04.513 --> 23:06.602
- It's just--I had so many
responsibilities

23:06.646 --> 23:08.952
at the Time Bureau.
People needed me.

23:08.996 --> 23:10.911
You get it?

23:12.391 --> 23:14.393
- You see that clown sitting
over there?

23:14.436 --> 23:16.960
The one riddled
with responsibilities.

23:17.004 --> 23:18.440
Look at him.

23:18.484 --> 23:20.790
He's miserable
and he's welcome to it.

23:20.834 --> 23:22.401
- I just can't get over
the fact

23:22.444 --> 23:24.054
that nobody needs me
to do anything.

23:25.491 --> 23:27.449
Wait.

23:27.493 --> 23:30.452
Nobody needs me to do anything.

23:30.496 --> 23:31.932
- You two still
at the Blue Iguana?

23:31.975 --> 23:35.152
- Uh, yes Captain,
just following orders.

23:35.196 --> 23:37.720
- Great, I need you and Ava
to create a diversion.

23:37.764 --> 23:39.374
Clear the place out.

23:39.418 --> 23:42.595
I'm gonna draw Bugsy back to
the club so we can capture him.

23:44.466 --> 23:46.076
- I can do that.

23:51.995 --> 23:54.737
- Always a pleasure, Chief.
The lobster was excellent.

23:54.781 --> 23:56.826
- Stop right there, Mr. Siegel.

23:56.870 --> 23:58.437
- What's the problem, officer?

23:58.480 --> 24:00.830
- I, uh, I just need
to search you before you leave.

24:00.874 --> 24:02.528
- This is highly irregular.

24:02.571 --> 24:04.399
- Actually, it's quite regular.

24:04.443 --> 24:09.056
A new directive just came down
from Deputy Chief Wiggum.

24:09.709 --> 24:10.840
It's just gonna take second--

24:10.884 --> 24:13.539
- What are you doing, son?

24:13.582 --> 24:16.629
- Mr. Siegel, call for you.
Sounds urgent.

24:21.547 --> 24:23.244
- Siegel here.

24:23.287 --> 24:24.941
- Benjamin, darling.
It's me.

24:24.985 --> 24:28.379
Your new favorite source
for all things juicy.

24:28.423 --> 24:30.773
- Lance, what's the rumpus?

24:30.817 --> 24:32.383
Must be pretty heavy if you're
calling me on the blower.

24:32.427 --> 24:35.169
- Well, something is going down
at your club.

24:35.212 --> 24:36.779
Primo blackmail material.

24:36.823 --> 24:39.216
Better leg it over here PDQ.

24:46.528 --> 24:48.008
Sorry, guys.

24:48.051 --> 24:50.489
Bugsy's leaving the station
and he still has the gun.

24:50.532 --> 24:51.925
- No worry, big man.

24:56.582 --> 24:58.148
I've got it covered.

25:01.587 --> 25:04.067
- You take care now,
Mr. Siegel.

25:06.505 --> 25:09.116
- Hey, baby.

25:20.606 --> 25:22.477
- You back to working the beat,
Sergeant?

25:23.347 --> 25:27.264
- Ha, I was just admiring
Mr. Siegel's automobile.

25:27.308 --> 25:28.918
I guess crime really does pay.

25:28.962 --> 25:30.572
- Not today it doesn't.

25:30.616 --> 25:32.182
'Cause I'm gonna do something
about it.

25:32.226 --> 25:33.923
You in, or what?

25:38.885 --> 25:42.279

27:34.870 --> 27:37.351

Something's stirring.

27:41.834 --> 27:43.618
What is all this?

27:43.662 --> 27:45.054
- ♪ A warrior

27:46.752 --> 27:48.754
some no-name dame
humiliate herself on stage?

27:48.797 --> 27:50.973
- First of all,
she is not a no-name.

27:51.017 --> 27:52.322
That is my girlfriend.

27:52.366 --> 27:54.977
And second,
she is not humiliating herself.

27:55.021 --> 27:57.023
- Yes she is.
- She's enjoying herself.

27:57.066 --> 27:58.241
- So this was just
a lousy trick

27:58.285 --> 27:59.068
to get me down here.

27:59.112 --> 28:00.679
There's no dirt, is there?

28:00.722 --> 28:02.071
- The dirt is you.

28:02.115 --> 28:03.464
You're supposed to be dead.

28:03.507 --> 28:05.596
Instead you're blackmailing
your way to the top.

28:05.640 --> 28:08.077
- After I came back, I realized
that violence and murder--

28:08.121 --> 28:09.775
that only gets you so far.

28:11.428 --> 28:13.169
That's the real power

- Well, whatever your deal is,
you're screwing up history,

28:15.911 --> 28:18.609
and it is my job to stop you.

28:18.653 --> 28:19.828
So you don't have
to go to Hell,

28:19.872 --> 28:21.177
but you can't stay here.

Lance.

28:25.181 --> 28:26.661

28:36.236 --> 28:37.846

29:01.435 --> 29:04.612
- Yep, first agent
when I was 11.

29:04.655 --> 29:07.441
He was a real piece of work.

29:07.484 --> 29:10.052
Eventually, I took control
of everything.

29:10.096 --> 29:12.011
- Can I ask you something?
- Hmm?

29:12.054 --> 29:13.360
- When you first saw me,

29:13.403 --> 29:15.797
did you feel
like we met before?

29:15.841 --> 29:17.930
- Maybe.
I meet a lot of fans.

29:17.973 --> 29:22.108
- No, I mean,
we met in another life.

29:23.326 --> 29:25.024
- Oh.

29:27.809 --> 29:30.116
- Yeah, I totally got
that vibe.

29:30.159 --> 29:31.682
- Oh, so it's not all
in my head.

29:31.726 --> 29:33.946
I feel like I've been living
out this Taylor Swift song,

29:33.989 --> 29:35.469
but it feels crazy good.

29:35.512 --> 29:37.732
- We're definitely
connected somehow,

29:37.776 --> 29:40.387
but something feels off.

29:40.430 --> 29:44.826
I think the you I remember
wasn't a professor.

29:47.176 --> 29:49.613
Come on, I know
Behrad's been lying

29:49.657 --> 29:53.095
to my parents about
business school for years.

29:53.139 --> 29:55.881
I only wanna make sure
that he's been taking

29:55.924 --> 29:59.101
really good care
of our family's totem.

29:59.145 --> 30:01.974
Which he has been, right?

30:04.541 --> 30:06.282
- Yo, dude,
we're cutting the cake,

30:06.326 --> 30:08.371
and they're asking
for the special guest.

30:08.415 --> 30:10.286
Come on.

30:10.330 --> 30:12.854
- Chill, B, your friend and I
were just talking.

30:12.898 --> 30:13.899
- Sure you were. Let's go.
- Good talk.

30:13.942 --> 30:15.552
- Bye, Professor.
- I warned you.

30:15.596 --> 30:17.467
- Bye.
Stop pushing.

30:21.950 --> 30:24.213
- How did you figure out
what these numbers meant?

30:24.257 --> 30:26.041
- I spend more time
in graveyards

30:26.085 --> 30:27.782
than I care to admit.

30:27.826 --> 30:30.002
Elysian is a common moniker
for them.

30:30.045 --> 30:32.047
And those numbers,
they represent

30:32.091 --> 30:36.182
a specific location
for a particular gravestone.

30:39.141 --> 30:40.447
There's something here.

30:43.493 --> 30:44.930
Let's see, shall we?

30:49.717 --> 30:50.892
That's it.

30:50.936 --> 30:53.852
- Well, aren't we a pair
of jammy bastards.

30:53.895 --> 30:56.332
Now, it's time to destroy.

30:58.334 --> 31:01.120
- Forget the matches.
Step away from the briefcase.

31:01.163 --> 31:03.905
- Oh, hold on now, love.

31:03.949 --> 31:05.951
We're all on
the same side here.

31:06.647 --> 31:08.823
- There's only one side
I'm on, John,

31:08.867 --> 31:10.956
and that's mine.

31:15.874 --> 31:17.353
- You told me you wanted
to destroy that stash

31:17.397 --> 31:19.355
so that you and everyone else
in the town could be free.

31:19.399 --> 31:20.879
- Yeah, but I figured
why destroy it

31:20.922 --> 31:23.316
when I could
just use it for myself?

31:23.359 --> 31:26.754
I'm sick and tired of people
taking advantage of me.

31:26.797 --> 31:28.277
With this briefcase,

31:28.321 --> 31:30.062
I'll finally have
some real power around here.

31:30.105 --> 31:31.324
- Look, I understand
your anger,

31:31.367 --> 31:33.500
but as soon as you touch
Bugsy's dirt

31:33.543 --> 31:35.284
then you'll have a target
on your back just like him.

31:35.328 --> 31:39.027
But if you leave now,
you can start over,

31:39.071 --> 31:40.681
have a new life.

31:40.724 --> 31:43.423
Look, you don't have
to do this, Jeannie.

31:44.163 --> 31:46.556
Just walk away.

31:46.600 --> 31:47.601
- Walk away?

31:49.559 --> 31:52.127
Do you really expect me
to give up this power

31:52.171 --> 31:55.261
after being so powerless
my whole life?

32:00.875 --> 32:03.922
- You know what?
You're right.

32:10.102 --> 32:12.626
Who am I to tell you
what to do anyway?

32:14.410 --> 32:17.022
- See, it's working already.

32:22.853 --> 32:25.856
- Okay, what do we do now?

32:25.900 --> 32:29.208
- Once Bugsy's girl gets back
to her car with the stash,

32:29.251 --> 32:31.993
we're gonna take care
of the whole situation.

32:32.037 --> 32:34.256
- Take--what do you mean
"take care of"?

32:34.300 --> 32:37.042
- You really are
a straight arrow, aren't you?

32:37.085 --> 32:40.219
- Wait a second,
you wanna destroy the stash

32:40.262 --> 32:42.438
and Jeannie along with it?

32:42.482 --> 32:43.483
W--why?

32:43.526 --> 32:45.659
- She's just collateral damage.

32:45.702 --> 32:46.834
It's the cost of war.

32:46.877 --> 32:48.314
- You're a police officer.

32:48.357 --> 32:49.358
- Did you ever hear
the one about

32:49.402 --> 32:51.273
the last good cop
in Los Angeles?

32:51.317 --> 32:54.015
It didn't end well for him.

32:54.059 --> 32:56.148
- Well, how's this
for an ending?

32:56.191 --> 32:58.280
Get outta the car.
Now.

32:58.324 --> 32:59.803
- You sure you wanna do that?

33:12.686 --> 33:14.209
- If you were coming
all the way to Burbank

33:14.253 --> 33:15.558
just to meet up
with your mobster friends

33:15.602 --> 33:18.474
and kill Jeannie,
why even bring me along?

33:18.518 --> 33:20.520
- 'Cause we needed a fall guy.

33:26.091 --> 33:28.658
Come on, boys.
Drinks are on the LAPD.

33:31.226 --> 33:34.012
- Well, I guess this is
where we say good-bye, Johnny.

33:34.055 --> 33:36.188
It's been swell.

33:39.626 --> 33:44.065
Five bullets left.
Use them wisely.

33:54.075 --> 33:55.729
- No, no!

34:01.126 --> 34:03.128
Jeannie.

34:11.092 --> 34:12.789
John, Jeannie.

34:19.927 --> 34:21.233
- Jeannie.

34:23.322 --> 34:26.151
Jeannie!
Jeannie, no!

34:40.382 --> 34:42.732
- They killed her.

34:42.776 --> 34:45.648
- Forget it, Ray.

34:45.692 --> 34:47.085
It's Burbank.

34:56.616 --> 34:59.097
- Hey, holding cell
still works.

35:01.316 --> 35:03.666
- Who are you people?

35:03.710 --> 35:04.754
You communists?

35:04.798 --> 35:06.278
- Idiots.

35:06.321 --> 35:08.149
- I know you're probably
pretty confused, Mr. Siegel,

35:08.193 --> 35:10.151
but you might as well make
yourself comfortable

35:10.195 --> 35:13.372
because you may be here
for a while.

35:13.415 --> 35:15.635
- I should blast you
straight to oblivion,

35:15.678 --> 35:16.679
you damn bastard.

35:16.723 --> 35:18.420
You made Jeannie's
life miserable

35:18.464 --> 35:19.813
and now she's dead
because of you.

35:19.856 --> 35:22.250
- I may have corrupted
a wannabe starlet.

35:23.251 --> 35:26.515
But you?
You created a real monster.

35:27.342 --> 35:29.214
Astra Logue.

35:30.824 --> 35:31.825
- You know what?

35:31.868 --> 35:33.479
It's funny
that you mention her.

35:33.522 --> 35:36.438
I was just about to go
and see her.

35:36.482 --> 35:38.875
- John, if you're about to do
what I think you're gonna do,

35:38.919 --> 35:40.877
then you'd better be sure.

35:42.183 --> 35:43.445
- Hand him over, big man.

35:43.489 --> 35:45.230
- Go on.

35:45.273 --> 35:47.188
- Yeah, that's it, big boy.

35:47.232 --> 35:49.234
See, you're my ticket to Hell.

35:52.019 --> 35:53.934
- Ah.

35:57.807 --> 36:01.289
Flesh become my flesh,
soul become my soul.

36:01.333 --> 36:03.726
Hades, firstborn
of Cronus and Rhea,

36:03.770 --> 36:05.250
I call upon you.

36:05.293 --> 36:07.165
Light her up, big man.

36:25.792 --> 36:27.663
- Hey, Astra says
you're banned.

36:27.707 --> 36:29.535
- Is that so?

36:43.244 --> 36:45.246
- You just can't stay away,
can you?

36:45.290 --> 36:46.987
- Careful, he's still got
one bullet left.

36:47.030 --> 36:49.294
- Oh, I appreciate
your concern, Benjamin,

36:49.337 --> 36:51.383
but I'm not worried about him.

36:51.426 --> 36:53.341
We're old friends,
aren't we, Johnny?

36:55.256 --> 36:56.910
So why don't you tell me

36:56.953 --> 36:59.565
what you came all the way
down here for?

36:59.608 --> 37:02.872
- I came all the way down here
to tell you...

37:10.140 --> 37:12.012
That I'm not giving up on you.

37:12.055 --> 37:14.362
And even if it takes me
till the end of my days,

37:14.406 --> 37:18.540
I promise you
that I will find a way.

37:18.584 --> 37:20.368
- Another meaningless promise

37:20.412 --> 37:23.589
made by the great
John Constantine.

37:25.243 --> 37:28.550
You've gone soft.

37:30.335 --> 37:31.597
- Not that soft.

37:32.598 --> 37:34.252
This one's for Jeannie.

37:43.348 --> 37:44.958
I'll be seeing you around,
love.

37:51.704 --> 37:53.271
- So what happened down there?

37:54.010 --> 37:55.142
- I need a drink.

37:55.185 --> 37:57.100
- Not this time.

37:57.144 --> 37:58.798
Is Astra...?

37:59.538 --> 38:01.844
- When I got down there,
I was swarmed.

38:01.888 --> 38:03.803
Astra had the drop on me.
She knew I was coming.

38:04.760 --> 38:06.980
- And the gun?
- It's gone.

38:08.460 --> 38:10.070
- We'll figure out another way.

38:10.113 --> 38:12.028
- Yeah.

38:14.596 --> 38:18.600
- Hey, whatever really
happened back there with Astra,

38:18.644 --> 38:19.993
I'm sure it wasn't easy.

38:20.036 --> 38:21.734
- What are you talking about,
big man?

38:21.777 --> 38:24.606
- Just so you know,
if I had taken care of Nora

38:24.650 --> 38:26.434
back when we all thought
she was evil,

38:26.478 --> 38:28.697
we wouldn't be happy
and together right now.

38:30.003 --> 38:31.961
- Oh, I had the chance
to pull the trigger,

38:32.005 --> 38:33.485
to end all this.

38:34.486 --> 38:35.965
But I couldn't do it.

38:37.924 --> 38:39.926
What's all
your grinning about?

38:41.101 --> 38:43.364
- Just happy there's still
good guys out there.

38:43.408 --> 38:46.454
Even if one of them is
a master of the dark arts.

38:46.498 --> 38:48.456
- You know, you're wrong
about me, Ray.

38:48.500 --> 38:50.502
But I will save Astra,
and you should know

38:50.545 --> 38:53.983
it's just as much for me
as it is for her, all right?

38:59.032 --> 39:00.773
- Hey, don't give Ava
a hard time

39:00.816 --> 39:01.904
for getting on stage,
all right?

39:01.948 --> 39:03.341
I don't want her to be
too embarrassed.

39:03.384 --> 39:04.864
- She's not gonna remember
a thing.

39:06.082 --> 39:08.171
- Well, hello!
Ha.

39:08.215 --> 39:10.348
Where's my invite
to this party, huh, Mickey boy?

39:11.479 --> 39:13.568
- I spat in that.

39:13.612 --> 39:14.917
Old prison habit.

39:14.961 --> 39:16.528
- Mmm.

39:16.571 --> 39:21.402
I cannot believe that I sang
in front of all those people.

39:22.229 --> 39:23.361
I w--

39:25.101 --> 39:26.712
I was awesome.

39:26.755 --> 39:29.279
I killed it.
I k--

39:29.323 --> 39:31.107
And did you see my backup band?

39:31.151 --> 39:33.588
They were like,
"Ooh, tsh tsh, mwah"

39:33.632 --> 39:37.244
Uh, please, please tell me
somebody got a video.

39:37.287 --> 39:39.899
- Actually, we--
- Uh-uh.

39:41.422 --> 39:43.685
- Mm, and another thing.

39:43.729 --> 39:45.818
Seriously, Sara,
I love you so much.

39:45.861 --> 39:47.950
Working that side mish
with Rory

39:47.994 --> 39:51.389
was way more fun than running
any stupid Time Bureau.

39:51.432 --> 39:53.260
Like "responsinilities."

39:53.303 --> 39:54.914
Wha--?
Who needs 'em.

39:54.957 --> 39:58.526
- Oh, good babe,
I'm glad you had fun.

39:58.570 --> 40:01.834
Just know there is
no small role on this team.

40:01.877 --> 40:03.923
Right, Rory?

40:03.966 --> 40:05.228
- Right.

40:08.928 --> 40:11.409
- Mm-kay, night-night,
sweetheart.

40:16.544 --> 40:19.417
- Look, there is more to Zari
than you give her credit for.

40:19.460 --> 40:23.421
She is buried down deep inside
underneath all that fame.

40:23.464 --> 40:24.509
- You were getting'
played, man.

40:24.552 --> 40:25.858
Don't feel bad.

40:25.901 --> 40:27.773
She does this all the time.

40:27.816 --> 40:29.165
- I know who you are.

40:29.209 --> 40:30.689
- You do?
- Yeah.

40:30.732 --> 40:32.734
The more we talked,
the more you looked familiar.

40:32.778 --> 40:34.388
Then I realized
where I knew you from.

40:34.432 --> 40:35.563
- The Waverider.

40:35.607 --> 40:36.825
- What's a Waverider?
No.

40:36.869 --> 40:38.392
Heyworld.

40:38.436 --> 40:41.482
Tell me that's not you there
in the star spangled outfit.

40:41.526 --> 40:42.744
In fact, you were both there.

40:42.788 --> 40:44.529
That's totally you, Behrad.

40:44.572 --> 40:46.269
Can't believe
I never noticed it before.

40:46.313 --> 40:49.751
What I don't get is how
Heyworld was 24 years ago,

40:49.795 --> 40:52.232
but you two haven't aged a day.

40:52.275 --> 40:53.799
What the hell is going on?

40:53.842 --> 40:56.105
- Zari, you've finally lost it.

40:57.063 --> 40:58.586
- You accuse me
of being a fake,

40:58.630 --> 41:00.588
but you're the one
living a lie.

41:00.632 --> 41:01.894
Maman, Baba--

41:01.937 --> 41:03.330
- Okay, shh.
Just hang on.

41:03.373 --> 41:04.636
- No, I will not hang on.

41:04.679 --> 41:07.029
It's time they finally heard
the truth.

41:13.949 --> 41:16.561
What the hell?
Where am I?

41:16.604 --> 41:21.130
- You are on a 22nd century
timeship, designation WR2059.

41:21.174 --> 41:22.958
Currently situated
in the temporal zone.

41:23.002 --> 41:24.830
- Hey, guys,
who's your friend?

41:24.873 --> 41:26.309
- We can explain everything.

41:26.353 --> 41:28.137
- Yeah, ya better.

41:28.181 --> 41:29.661
- Who are you people?

41:29.704 --> 41:31.967
- Guys, meet Zari.

41:32.011 --> 41:33.055
She's my sister.

41:34.666 --> 41:37.886
- Whoa, oh, oh.
Help!

41:37.930 --> 41:41.760
Help!

41:41.803 --> 41:43.022
Help!

41:43.065 --> 41:47.417
♪ That girl is poison

41:47.461 --> 41:49.028
- Ahh!

42:11.398 --> 42:12.660
- Greg, move your head.
