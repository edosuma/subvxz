01:33.260 --> 01:35.502
Proctor, you've been singing
Christmas songs...

01:35.679 --> 01:38.171
...for the entire five hours
of this stakeout.

01:38.348 --> 01:40.340
Christmas is a good four months away.

01:40.517 --> 01:44.306
If you sing so much as one more note...

01:44.521 --> 01:47.810
...I will shoot you.

02:16.887 --> 02:18.674
Go ahead...

02:18.847 --> 02:21.840
...make my Christmas.

02:30.233 --> 02:31.769
Sir, can we call it a day?

02:31.943 --> 02:34.936
I've got a very good tip
that the Wilson Heights Gang...

02:35.113 --> 02:38.072
...is gonna rob the jewelry store
across the street.

02:38.241 --> 02:42.485
I thought we might wait at least until
they showed up before we call it a day.

02:42.663 --> 02:45.076
- Is that okay with you?
- Yes, sir.

02:48.210 --> 02:50.918
I usually read the funnies
to my niece on Sunday.

02:51.088 --> 02:52.750
Don't you understand?

02:52.923 --> 02:55.131
It took me a year to get transferred...

02:55.300 --> 02:57.883
...away from Lassard
and his band of misfits.

02:58.095 --> 03:02.886
Now that I've got my own precinct,
I'm not gonna let anyone screw with me.

03:04.309 --> 03:06.141
It's my precinct.
I make the rules.

03:06.311 --> 03:09.895
No one takes so much as a leak
without my say-so.

03:10.065 --> 03:12.182
- I have a sixth sense.
- Sir--

03:12.359 --> 03:15.568
- Let me finish. I have a sixth--
- But, sir!

03:15.737 --> 03:17.148
Would you let me finish?

03:17.322 --> 03:19.905
I have a sixth sense
when it comes to crime--

03:20.075 --> 03:22.533
- But, sir!
- Stop interrupting me!

03:22.786 --> 03:26.905
I have got a sixth sense
when it comes to crime.

03:27.082 --> 03:30.041
My instincts tell me this crime wave...

03:30.210 --> 03:33.749
...is about to come to an abrupt end.

03:42.973 --> 03:45.010
Hey, you! Hold it!

03:45.183 --> 03:49.052
- Hold it!
- Freeze!

03:49.646 --> 03:51.387
Captain Harris!

03:51.898 --> 03:53.389
What are you doing here?

03:53.567 --> 03:57.026
Well, we're on a stakeout.
What's all this about?

03:57.195 --> 03:59.187
The Wilson Heights Gang struck again.

03:59.448 --> 04:01.940
- Where?
- There, sir.

04:02.117 --> 04:04.234
Right behind you.

04:04.453 --> 04:06.160
When did you get here, sir?

04:06.329 --> 04:08.571
- Well, we--
- We've been here five hours.

04:08.749 --> 04:11.992
- Shut up, Proctor.
- You were here during the robbery?

04:12.169 --> 04:14.001
- Of course not.
- Yes, we were, sir.

04:14.171 --> 04:15.878
- They came a few minutes ago.
- Shut up.

04:16.047 --> 04:17.379
- I tried to tell you.
- Shut up.

04:17.548 --> 04:20.507
- Don't you remember? Inside the car.
- Shut up. Shut up. Shut up!

04:32.522 --> 04:35.185
Oh, gentlemen...

04:35.358 --> 04:39.853
...you promised me you would have
this gang in custody two weeks ago!

04:40.030 --> 04:43.239
Instead, they're making us look
like a bunch of-- Uh...

04:43.408 --> 04:46.492
Oh, the ones that are very funny.

04:46.745 --> 04:49.909
The kings have them.
Bring me my f-- Fools!

04:50.081 --> 04:52.573
- Making us look like fools!
- Mr. Mayor, I--

04:52.751 --> 04:54.708
- I can assure you--
- Save it.

04:55.420 --> 04:58.584
People are afraid. They're taking
their business elsewhere.

04:58.757 --> 05:01.875
The merchants are all over me.
Some very important--

05:02.052 --> 05:04.886
The ones that--
Feathers are being ruffled here.

05:05.055 --> 05:06.887
And now the governor is involved!

05:07.057 --> 05:09.549
He wants this crime wave
stopped immediately.

05:10.435 --> 05:14.725
And he is sending in a special team...

05:14.898 --> 05:19.393
...to see that the crime wave is stopped.

05:19.569 --> 05:20.901
Mr. Mayor, Your Honor--

05:21.071 --> 05:23.734
I think what Captain Harris
is trying to say...

05:23.907 --> 05:26.069
...is his department will appreciate...

05:26.243 --> 05:29.577
- ...all the help it can get.
- Yes. Good. Thank you.

05:29.746 --> 05:34.662
But due to the possibility of a leak
in Captain Harris' department...

05:34.835 --> 05:37.578
...the governor chose a team
outside the precinct.

05:37.754 --> 05:41.213
He feels sure that they will bring
these scoundrels to the--

05:41.424 --> 05:43.336
You know, to the court thing.

05:43.510 --> 05:45.046
Justice! Bring them to justice.

05:46.721 --> 05:48.383
Oh, excuse me.

05:48.557 --> 05:51.721
Hello. Yeah.
Oh, send him in, yes.

05:51.893 --> 05:53.555
Thank you, Midge.

05:53.728 --> 05:56.766
Captain Harris, Commissioner Hurst...

05:56.940 --> 06:00.433
...I'm sure you know
Commandant Lassard.

06:00.610 --> 06:02.567
Thank you, Midge.

06:05.699 --> 06:08.692
You-- Let me make sure
I understand this.

06:09.953 --> 06:13.117
You are going to be working with me.

06:13.456 --> 06:15.038
Side by side.

06:19.296 --> 06:22.630
I feel just the same.

06:23.425 --> 06:26.964
We're very happy to have you with us,
Commandant Lassard.

06:27.137 --> 06:29.299
I am sure, sure...

06:29.472 --> 06:32.135
...that you will help us tree these swine.

06:32.309 --> 06:35.427
Your Honor, I have just the men
for the job.

07:29.699 --> 07:31.281
Oh!

07:33.745 --> 07:36.829
Now, who wants to go one-on-one?

07:37.707 --> 07:39.369
No.

07:46.466 --> 07:47.923
Heads up, people!

07:48.093 --> 07:49.755
It's Brad. He's such a child.

07:49.928 --> 07:52.136
- Hello.
- Nice seeing you again.

07:52.305 --> 07:54.763
- You look lovely.
- Thank you.

07:54.933 --> 07:57.346
- Do call sometime, we'll have lunch.
- I will.

07:57.519 --> 07:59.977
- Hello, dear.
- Hello.

08:00.397 --> 08:03.014
- Hi, Mrs. Stanwyck.
- Hi, Jonesy.

08:03.191 --> 08:05.353
Did you ever see such a bunch of stiffs?

08:05.527 --> 08:07.393
Elaine, exceptional event.

08:07.570 --> 08:09.607
Watch this.

08:22.544 --> 08:24.957
What on earth is he doing?

08:36.640 --> 08:38.758
Thanks, pal.

08:38.934 --> 08:41.597
That should get me through the next hour.

08:44.983 --> 08:46.940
Excuse me.

08:49.154 --> 08:52.989
- What do you think you're doing?
- I'm a police officer. It's my duty--

08:53.158 --> 08:57.198
- Do you have any idea who I am?
- No, but I wanted to--

08:57.370 --> 08:59.783
I'm Wendell P. Farnsworth.

08:59.956 --> 09:04.621
My brother-in-law's a councilman, I'm a
personal friend of the watch commander.

09:04.919 --> 09:09.129
So I suggest we forget all about
this little misunderstanding.

09:09.674 --> 09:12.508
- Got me?
- But you were parked in a red zone.

09:12.677 --> 09:16.296
- I have to give you a ticket--
- Let me make it clear to you, girl.

09:24.022 --> 09:25.388
Now, get out of here...

09:25.565 --> 09:27.807
...before I have you busted down...

09:27.984 --> 09:30.476
...to crossing guard.

09:32.739 --> 09:35.277
- All right.
- You told her.

09:35.450 --> 09:38.943
You got to know how to handle peons,
you know what I mean?

09:40.163 --> 09:42.450
What now?

09:43.083 --> 09:46.076
- What's this?
- Citations for parking in a red zone...

09:46.252 --> 09:49.745
...more than 18 inches from the curb,
blocking a fire hydrant...

09:49.923 --> 09:55.260
...expired registration, no front plate,
littering, attempt to extort an officer...

09:55.428 --> 09:58.512
...and willfully destroying
a court summons.

10:00.225 --> 10:01.761
Oh, no! My car!

10:01.935 --> 10:07.522
You can pick it up at the police impound
after you pay for your citations, boy!

10:52.277 --> 10:55.111
- Morning, son.
- Morning, Dad.

10:55.280 --> 10:57.818
Possible 211 in progress
in the living room.

10:57.991 --> 11:02.577
- Shall we call for backup?
- No. We can handle it.

11:21.890 --> 11:24.849
- Grandpa.
- Dad.

11:26.436 --> 11:28.678
All I took is a lousy sandwich.

11:30.690 --> 11:33.683
Good morning and welcome
to the Wilson Heights Division.

11:33.860 --> 11:36.273
Now, let's get to work.

11:37.906 --> 11:41.741
This gang has been one step ahead of us.

11:41.910 --> 11:45.995
Now, the governor feels that someone
in this department...

11:46.164 --> 11:48.747
...may be leaking.

11:50.919 --> 11:53.457
To guard against that possibility...

11:53.630 --> 11:57.624
...only the people in this room
will know our plans.

11:58.843 --> 12:01.802
Now, these boards...

12:01.971 --> 12:05.339
...carry the only information we have...

12:05.516 --> 12:08.634
...about these robberies.

12:10.063 --> 12:12.476
We--
Captain Harris?

12:12.732 --> 12:16.726
Commandant.
Thank you, Commandant Lassard.

12:16.903 --> 12:19.065
Though we have dozens of eyewitnesses...

12:19.239 --> 12:23.483
...no one has been able to identify
any of these men from our mug books.

12:23.660 --> 12:25.743
We can only assume therefore...

12:27.163 --> 12:31.248
...they have no police records.
Three sets of unidentified fingerprints...

12:31.417 --> 12:33.579
...have been found at each crime scene.

12:33.753 --> 12:37.212
But running them through our records
has also drawn us a blank.

12:37.382 --> 12:39.795
Whoever these perpetrators are,
they're pros.

12:39.968 --> 12:43.132
But they have made one fatal mistake.

12:43.304 --> 12:45.341
They chose...

12:45.515 --> 12:47.677
...my precinct.

12:48.101 --> 12:51.594
Yeah! Yeah! All right! All right!

12:51.771 --> 12:54.058
- Ten-hut!
- Be seated.

12:54.232 --> 12:59.023
- I've been briefing the men, sir.
- Thank you, Captain Harris.

12:59.445 --> 13:01.653
Now, in the--

13:01.990 --> 13:05.074
- Sir, are you okay?
- Get away!

13:11.082 --> 13:14.746
In the absence of identifiable
fingerprints and photographs...

13:14.919 --> 13:18.879
...we're gonna have to rely
on good old-fashioned police work.

13:19.048 --> 13:23.292
Commandant, I thought you said
you had a seven-man team.

13:23.469 --> 13:24.880
I do, commissioner.

13:26.222 --> 13:27.884
- Morning.
- Ow!

13:28.182 --> 13:29.718
- Hi, there.
- Morning.

13:29.892 --> 13:32.384
- Hello.
- Hey.

13:36.190 --> 13:38.056
Nice day.

13:44.157 --> 13:45.693
- Morning.
- Hi.

13:47.577 --> 13:49.785
It's good to be back.

14:00.423 --> 14:03.416
Gentlemen, you all know Sergeant Fackler.

14:03.593 --> 14:06.006
- Commissioner Hurst.
- Hello there, sergeant.

14:06.179 --> 14:07.920
Now that our team is complete...

14:08.097 --> 14:11.090
...I know we shall soon
triumph over our enemies.

14:11.267 --> 14:14.431
Hi. Laverne. Hightower.

14:14.604 --> 14:16.345
- Hi, I'm Nick.
- Hello.

14:16.522 --> 14:18.855
How do you--?
Whoops!

14:26.616 --> 14:30.155
Fackler, get a mop!

14:32.330 --> 14:33.616
A mop.

14:40.963 --> 14:42.955
Evacuate!

14:43.341 --> 14:46.084
Evacuate this room now!

14:54.477 --> 14:57.515
This is not a good combination.

15:05.363 --> 15:06.695
Fire in the hole.

15:13.496 --> 15:16.660
Come on, come on. Let's go.
Hurry up.

15:18.501 --> 15:20.709
Where you from originally?

15:28.177 --> 15:29.634
Hm-mm.

15:32.640 --> 15:33.972
You the president?

15:44.902 --> 15:47.110
- You got the key for this?
- No.

15:47.280 --> 15:48.862
Okay.

15:57.540 --> 15:59.281
He lifted you out of your chair?

15:59.459 --> 16:02.793
And across my desk,
and he carried me into the vault.

16:05.465 --> 16:07.206
Excuse me.

16:09.719 --> 16:14.805
Excuse me. He got away
with approximately $190,000.

16:15.099 --> 16:16.886
Thank you.

16:18.352 --> 16:20.184
Thank you.

16:20.730 --> 16:22.437
Thank you.

16:23.983 --> 16:27.067
Well, suggestions?

16:27.236 --> 16:28.568
I suggest we canvass--

16:28.738 --> 16:32.448
Canvass the entire area
with our modified police-artist sketches.

16:32.617 --> 16:35.781
Who knows, we might get lucky.

16:36.662 --> 16:40.246
- The word--
- Word on the street might help.

16:40.416 --> 16:43.909
Listen to the stoolies,
maybe put a few men undercover.

16:44.212 --> 16:46.078
Well, Commandant Lassard?

16:47.006 --> 16:48.497
The word on the street...

16:48.674 --> 16:52.418
...might give us a clue.

16:52.595 --> 16:55.759
I think I just said that.

16:57.558 --> 17:01.051
At his age, the memory comes and goes.

17:02.104 --> 17:03.561
Whoops!

17:03.773 --> 17:06.936
Hey, Debbie, take a look at this.

17:07.108 --> 17:08.771
Thank you, Douglas.

17:09.153 --> 17:12.112
Well, at least they didn't get
all the money, huh?

17:12.365 --> 17:15.949
They were too smart to take this.
It's an exploding dye pack.

17:16.117 --> 17:19.452
It's activated when you take it out
of the bank.

17:22.625 --> 17:25.867
If you remember anything else at all,
call Captain Harris.

17:26.045 --> 17:28.458
- Sir--
- What are you doing there, sergeant?

17:28.631 --> 17:30.623
Sir, I found money the gang dropped.

17:30.800 --> 17:34.794
- Thought I'd take it to the commissioner.
- That's all right, I'll take it.

17:34.971 --> 17:36.803
- I think a job--
- That will be all.

17:36.973 --> 17:38.305
Alrighty.

17:38.474 --> 17:40.090
- Proctor.
- Yes, sir.

17:40.268 --> 17:42.760
Keep an eye on these people.

17:47.567 --> 17:49.308
Commissioner.

17:53.948 --> 17:59.114
- Yes, Captain Harris.
- It wasn't important.

18:12.383 --> 18:15.091
Nick. Thanks, Clarke.

18:15.261 --> 18:17.719
I think we got something here.
Go ahead.

18:17.888 --> 18:20.175
- The big guy--
- Hang on, captain!

18:20.349 --> 18:22.841
Was breaking open
the safety-deposit boxes.

18:23.019 --> 18:26.808
The man with the guns told him not to,
and then they argued.

18:26.981 --> 18:28.563
Tell him what the guy said.

18:28.733 --> 18:30.850
The big guy said, "Why not?"

18:31.027 --> 18:35.362
The guy with the gun said, "Because
that's not what we're being paid for."

18:35.615 --> 18:37.527
They're just hired help.

18:37.700 --> 18:40.693
There must be somebody planning
the robberies.

18:41.203 --> 18:43.035
Somebody behind the scenes.

18:44.373 --> 18:46.035
A mastermind.

18:49.920 --> 18:51.536
- Ace.
- Yeah.

18:51.714 --> 18:54.297
Who do you think the boss really is?

18:54.467 --> 18:56.834
I don't know, but whoever he is...

18:57.011 --> 18:59.219
- ...he's certainly well-connected.
- Yeah.

18:59.388 --> 19:01.846
We know what the cops will do
before they do.

19:02.016 --> 19:04.724
- Ain't it something?
- Hey.

19:04.894 --> 19:06.851
Check out Ox.

19:07.146 --> 19:09.809
Ox, five minutes, your time's up.
You win the bet.

19:11.651 --> 19:12.983
You gotta pay him.

19:14.236 --> 19:15.977
I told you.

19:19.200 --> 19:21.317
<i>Good afternoon, gentlemen.</i>

19:21.494 --> 19:23.156
<i>I am pleased to say...</i>

19:23.329 --> 19:25.491
<i>...my plan is proceeding perfectly.</i>

19:28.542 --> 19:32.411
<i>Together, we have brought forth
a wave of crime...</i>

19:32.588 --> 19:34.830
<i>...such as this city has never known.</i>

19:35.174 --> 19:37.837
<i>Every mind is filled with dread.</i>

19:38.010 --> 19:41.549
<i>Every fear bears our name.</i>

19:41.722 --> 19:43.304
<i>Only a few more robberies...</i>

19:43.474 --> 19:47.718
<i>...and all will be ripe
for Operation Chaos.</i>

19:47.937 --> 19:50.896
<i>There will be panic, anarchy, destruction.</i>

19:51.941 --> 19:54.934
<i>We shall bring this city to its knees.</i>

19:58.823 --> 20:03.409
<i>Very funny. But we've talked
about this before, haven't we?</i>

20:03.577 --> 20:05.034
<i>Oh, yes.</i>

20:05.204 --> 20:07.787
<i>Bring them up here.</i>

20:07.957 --> 20:10.449
<i>Come on.</i>

20:10.918 --> 20:15.003
<i>You can have them back
at the end of the crime wave.</i>

20:16.424 --> 20:18.586
With all due respect, Your Reverence...

20:18.759 --> 20:21.092
...Lassard's people
are incompetent fools...

20:21.262 --> 20:24.346
...who are going to screw up
this whole investigation.

20:25.224 --> 20:27.807
I certainly appreciate
your difficulty, captain.

20:27.977 --> 20:30.811
I mean, after all,
I want these swine captured...

20:30.980 --> 20:33.438
...every bit as much as you do.

20:33.607 --> 20:36.600
What can I do? My hands are--

20:36.777 --> 20:38.143
The thing-- Oh!

20:38.320 --> 20:40.437
- With the ropes.
- Tied.

20:42.825 --> 20:48.617
When I want your help, Captain Harris,
you may rest assured, I will ask for it.

20:49.582 --> 20:53.826
After all, this is the governor's show,
isn't it? I mean, my hands are tied.

20:54.295 --> 20:56.161
However...

20:56.505 --> 20:59.669
...if you should find any evidence...

20:59.842 --> 21:02.676
...proving that Lassard and his men...

21:02.845 --> 21:04.882
...are hurting the investigation
in any way...

21:05.055 --> 21:06.421
Choo-choo-choo-choo,
woo-woo.

21:06.682 --> 21:10.426
...I would have no choice
but to go right to the governor...

21:10.603 --> 21:13.846
...and have them removed from the case.

21:14.023 --> 21:16.982
I wish you could run for a third term,
Your Honor.

21:17.151 --> 21:20.064
- I would love to vote for you again.
- Ow.

21:20.279 --> 21:23.989
- Me too.
- Thank you for that vote of confidence.

21:24.158 --> 21:28.368
Now, I'm very busy this afternoon.
So if you don't mind...

21:28.537 --> 21:30.369
...have a nice...

21:30.539 --> 21:32.576
- ...thingy.
- And you too, Your Honor.

21:32.750 --> 21:35.993
Don't you touch another thing.
Before we leave...

21:36.170 --> 21:39.208
...please allow me the privilege
to congratulate you...

21:39.381 --> 21:42.044
...on your fabulous collection
of model ships.

21:42.218 --> 21:45.882
Ah. Thank you.
Built them all myself.

21:46.096 --> 21:48.053
Of course, it's a labor of love.

21:48.682 --> 21:51.891
Now, take that one you're holding now
in your hands.

21:52.061 --> 21:54.929
I've spent a year on that little baby.

21:55.231 --> 21:56.972
Oh! Oh!

21:57.191 --> 21:59.524
Oh, no!

22:01.153 --> 22:03.019
I can fix it.

22:03.197 --> 22:05.985
- Oh.
- I've got the whole weekend.

22:06.700 --> 22:09.158
I'm very good with wood.

22:15.084 --> 22:16.996
It's okay.

22:18.379 --> 22:20.166
Trust me.

22:21.423 --> 22:22.755
Oh!

22:23.133 --> 22:24.749
Commissioner Hurst is right.

22:24.927 --> 22:27.419
We must start
with basic police investigation.

22:27.596 --> 22:29.713
We shall circulate these sketches...

22:29.890 --> 22:33.429
...by our very, very talented police artist.

22:33.936 --> 22:35.643
We shall come up with many,
many leads.

22:39.775 --> 22:41.641
Sorry I'm late.

22:43.904 --> 22:45.236
Did I miss anything?

22:50.661 --> 22:52.493
- Yes, Nick.
- Sir, we got a tip...

22:52.663 --> 22:56.077
...that an office at the Union Towers
is being used by the mob.

22:56.250 --> 22:58.617
I think sending two undercover officers...

22:58.794 --> 23:02.959
...to this location may give us the break
that'll crack this case wide open.

23:03.507 --> 23:07.968
- Sergeant Jones and myself--
- I'll handle this assignment, sergeant.

23:08.137 --> 23:12.051
I don't think an assignment like this
is appropriate for a man of your--

23:12.224 --> 23:13.556
Nonsense, sergeant.

23:13.726 --> 23:18.096
I was handling undercover cases
when you were still trick-or-treating.

23:19.064 --> 23:22.307
We'll have Captain Harris
and Lieutenant Proctor...

23:22.484 --> 23:26.194
...take the undercover assignment
at the Union Towers building.

23:38.834 --> 23:43.704
- Undercover work is sure exciting.
- Shut up, Proctor.

23:57.394 --> 24:00.102
Proctor, we're supposed to be undercover.

24:00.272 --> 24:02.764
I know, I was trying to throw them
off guard.

24:02.942 --> 24:05.309
- Just wash the windows.
- Sir.

24:05.486 --> 24:07.352
Thank you, sir.

24:25.464 --> 24:29.378
I think we need to talk
about what The Gang is gonna do next.

24:29.551 --> 24:32.715
Yeah. This next job is gonna be
the crucial one.

24:33.555 --> 24:35.262
<i>It's gonna be--</i>

24:36.976 --> 24:39.013
What are you doing?

24:39.186 --> 24:42.930
Sir, if you don't squeegee these
windows properly, it leaves streaks.

24:43.107 --> 24:46.566
- Squeegee over there.
- Oh.

25:02.584 --> 25:04.541
Thank you, sergeant.

25:04.712 --> 25:09.127
This used to be my boys' club.
Come on.

25:18.142 --> 25:21.180
It really has changed.

25:22.271 --> 25:24.183
Pardon the intrusion...

25:24.356 --> 25:27.940
...but I have these police sketches
I'd appreciate you looking at.

25:28.110 --> 25:29.726
Well, certainly, officer.

25:29.903 --> 25:34.113
But first, why don't we shoot a couple
of friendly games while we talk, huh?

25:34.366 --> 25:35.902
Splendid.

25:36.076 --> 25:39.069
This always was a friendly neighborhood.

25:40.748 --> 25:43.240
- Come here, son.
- I'll--

25:48.756 --> 25:53.672
Watch this. I'm gonna hustle this old fart
for everything he owns.

25:55.054 --> 25:57.262
Do you mind if I ask you a few questions?

25:57.431 --> 25:59.468
- Let's shoot first.
- Okay.

25:59.641 --> 26:01.257
Hold this.

26:01.435 --> 26:03.017
Hold this.

26:03.187 --> 26:04.928
Hold this.

26:11.153 --> 26:14.487
- I'm not good with sports, you know.
- Hey, sarge.

26:15.741 --> 26:18.449
This is--
I'll try.

26:18.619 --> 26:20.986
- I'll go first.
- Yeah, yeah.

26:32.800 --> 26:37.545
That's okay if you guys are tired,
I'll shoot again. This is nice.

26:46.563 --> 26:48.225
Jeez.

26:50.901 --> 26:52.858
That'll do it.

26:55.656 --> 26:57.488
What would you like to know?

26:58.700 --> 27:00.532
<i>You know what I'm saying, B</i>

27:00.702 --> 27:02.785
<i>OG</i>

27:02.955 --> 27:06.073
<i>Screaming almost damaged my ears
The people running in fear</i>

27:06.250 --> 27:10.540
<i>The hour to devour is near
Pandemonium, chaos, total destruction</i>

27:10.712 --> 27:13.204
<i>Tragedy portrays an eerie seduction</i>

27:13.382 --> 27:15.715
<i>Gunshots, fistfights, even knives</i>

27:15.884 --> 27:18.297
<i>People getting hurt
Others losing their lives</i>

27:18.470 --> 27:20.837
<i>No doubt about it
And you can't deny it</i>

27:21.014 --> 27:23.882
<i>What started as a quarrel
Turned into a riot</i>

27:24.059 --> 27:26.051
<i>Bodies laid out all over the ground</i>

27:26.228 --> 27:27.514
<i>Blood spattered everywhere</i>

27:27.688 --> 27:31.682
<i>People getting beat down
Inner city juvie going out with a bang</i>

27:31.859 --> 27:33.725
Hi, we're--

27:33.902 --> 27:36.110
Could you tell us--?

27:37.781 --> 27:40.364
<i>Your beat kept me moving
From right to left</i>

27:40.534 --> 27:42.742
<i>Your rap is, how you say, real def</i>

27:42.911 --> 27:45.153
<i>But we need some help
And some information</i>

27:45.330 --> 27:47.822
<i>About the gangs
In the Wilson Heights situation</i>

27:48.000 --> 27:50.492
<i>What do you know?
She's a rapper and a cop</i>

27:50.669 --> 27:53.002
<i>Man, everybody's rapping
Where will it stop</i>

27:53.172 --> 27:55.084
<i>People give rap a whole lot of beef</i>

27:55.257 --> 27:57.749
<i>But now old folks are rapping
Without no teeth</i>

27:58.010 --> 28:00.627
<i>We're rapping about gangs
That go around banging</i>

28:00.804 --> 28:04.639
<i>Robbing, stealing, shooting
Hanging on corners, polluting the nature</i>

28:04.808 --> 28:07.926
<i>So give me your number
In case we get some information</i>

28:08.103 --> 28:09.765
<i>- Word
- We believe you guys</i>

28:09.938 --> 28:12.430
<i>We won't dispute you
But if you're lying to us</i>

28:12.608 --> 28:15.066
<i>We'll come back and shoot you
Word</i>

28:23.118 --> 28:25.110
These guys are gonna be big.

28:27.456 --> 28:30.949
Yeah. So where's The Gang
living these days?

28:41.511 --> 28:43.503
Captain Harris?

28:44.306 --> 28:45.763
Shit. Ah!

28:46.433 --> 28:48.140
Oh, God!

28:50.646 --> 28:52.808
I'll feed the poor! Oh, please, help me!

28:52.981 --> 28:57.567
- Oh, please, help me! Mother!
- Okay. Okay.

28:57.778 --> 28:59.314
Okay.

28:59.488 --> 29:00.979
Okay, you can do it!

29:07.746 --> 29:10.784
Thank you, Proctor! I'll never forget--

29:36.108 --> 29:38.691
Don't worry about the pants!
Save yourself, sir!

29:38.860 --> 29:41.648
God, please don't let me die.

29:41.822 --> 29:43.734
I'm so young. Please...

29:44.116 --> 29:47.780
<i>--God, I'll help the homeless!
I'll feed the poor.</i>

29:47.953 --> 29:49.489
<i>Oh, I'll be so good.</i>

29:49.663 --> 29:52.952
<i>I mean it. I really, really mean it!</i>

29:55.544 --> 29:59.788
Thank you for your contribution,
Captain Harris.

30:04.011 --> 30:06.094
<i>Please, don't let me die!</i>

30:06.513 --> 30:08.095
<i>I'm--</i>

30:09.766 --> 30:12.179
Well, it would seem...

30:12.352 --> 30:16.312
...that all our old-fashioned police work
has netted us zip.

30:16.481 --> 30:18.222
We don't know who these men are.

30:18.400 --> 30:21.393
We don't know where they're going
to strike next.

30:21.570 --> 30:25.564
- Yes, sergeant.
- Well, maybe we do, sir.

30:28.660 --> 30:32.199
Maybe they'll strike
exactly where we want them to.

30:32.372 --> 30:33.704
Right.

30:35.959 --> 30:38.326
A trap is only as good as the bait you use.

30:48.430 --> 30:51.594
Red Leader to perimeter. Report.

30:52.976 --> 30:57.016
Checkpoint One. Nothing here.

31:01.443 --> 31:06.313
Well, hello there, little fellow.
Bet I got something for you.

31:06.490 --> 31:09.153
All right. Here we go.

31:09.326 --> 31:13.536
Look at this. See, I'm gonna get you
some good milk.

31:13.705 --> 31:17.324
Here. There you go.

31:19.753 --> 31:23.121
Let's just keep this
between me and you. Okay?

31:23.465 --> 31:27.459
<i>- Checkpoint Two?</i>
- Checkpoint Two. Negative.

31:28.720 --> 31:32.304
Airport. I'm in a hurry.

31:32.474 --> 31:34.215
Take the bus.

31:34.768 --> 31:39.638
I don't wanna take the bus.
I wanna take your cab. Now, step on it.

31:40.148 --> 31:44.688
You'll take the bus and like it.
Now, mister!

31:51.952 --> 31:54.194
He took me to dinner, then to his place.

31:54.371 --> 31:57.364
And we've been there all of two minutes
when he says:

31:57.541 --> 32:02.661
"Oh, baby, you're so fine.
How about some wine?"

32:02.838 --> 32:05.455
<i>- Checkpoint Five. Are you there?</i>
- Can you believe--?

32:05.632 --> 32:07.498
Just a minute, Di.

32:07.676 --> 32:10.919
Checkpoint Five. All quiet here.

32:11.680 --> 32:14.593
So then I look at him, and I say...

32:15.350 --> 32:17.182
<i>What's happening, Checkpoint Three?</i>

32:17.352 --> 32:20.641
Checkpoint Three. Nothing unusual here.

32:36.455 --> 32:39.038
<i>Checkpoint Four, report.</i>

32:41.084 --> 32:43.997
Checkpoint Four. Yeah, all clear.

32:54.181 --> 32:58.721
Thank you for calling K-D-O-Z. K-Doz,
the station where nothing happens.

32:58.894 --> 33:03.013
Come on, now, chin up.
I'm sure we'll get robbed any minute.

33:03.190 --> 33:04.681
Promises, promises.

33:09.362 --> 33:12.571
Right here, Proctor.
When this trap is sprung...

33:12.741 --> 33:18.408
...right here is where the action will be.
And I will be right in the middle of it.

33:18.955 --> 33:22.414
This is why I insisted
that I be given this assignment.

33:22.751 --> 33:25.334
You sure know how
to throw your fat around, sir.

33:25.587 --> 33:27.920
That's weight, Proctor.

33:28.381 --> 33:31.840
- Weight.
- Oh, weight.

34:00.539 --> 34:03.407
- What's that?
- I don't know, sir.

34:11.716 --> 34:15.130
They're out there, Proctor. I feel it.

34:15.303 --> 34:18.045
They'll attack this truck,
our men will move in...

34:18.223 --> 34:21.637
...and I will personally put an end
to the Wilson Heights Gang.

34:22.601 --> 34:24.309
It's quite simple, really.

34:30.819 --> 34:34.483
- Do you think we'll get commendations?
- Medals?

34:34.656 --> 34:38.320
They'll give me the key to the city.

35:05.270 --> 35:08.138
First, I'll address the city
on the 6:00 news.

35:08.315 --> 35:11.808
"The city is safe. It was my privilege
to serve you," et cetera.

35:11.985 --> 35:16.070
- Sir.
- I think maybe a parade is in order.

35:16.281 --> 35:18.989
- Sir.
- I'll be the grand marshal, of course.

35:19.159 --> 35:21.617
I'll have to face all the talk-show offers.

35:21.786 --> 35:24.449
- Sir!
- What is it, Proctor?

35:25.040 --> 35:26.997
Help! Pull me up!

35:27.792 --> 35:29.875
Help! No! No!

35:33.381 --> 35:34.838
Halt! Halt!

35:38.011 --> 35:40.344
- Halt! Halt!
- Help!

35:41.097 --> 35:43.589
They can't hear me, sir.

35:44.601 --> 35:48.015
Sir, running really is the best form
of aerobic exercise.

35:58.615 --> 36:01.073
Is it bad?

36:05.622 --> 36:08.285
They knew. They knew all about it.

36:08.458 --> 36:10.541
Somebody had to tip them off.

36:10.710 --> 36:13.874
- But only our team knew about the plan.
- No, Uncle Eric...

36:14.047 --> 36:17.006
...the leak is not in the precinct.

36:17.175 --> 36:18.507
It's one of us.

36:22.847 --> 36:25.430
Well, it seemed like
a good plan at the time.

36:25.600 --> 36:28.434
Oh, yes, yes. A fine plan.

36:28.603 --> 36:30.265
We lose a priceless diamond...

36:30.438 --> 36:33.681
...the Wilson Heights Gang
pulls the crime of the century...

36:33.858 --> 36:37.852
...and we look like a bunch of jerks
because we practically invited them.

36:38.029 --> 36:40.362
Do us a favor, Sergeant Lassard.

36:40.532 --> 36:42.865
The next time you have a brilliant idea...

36:43.034 --> 36:47.699
...please, keep it to yourself.

36:49.374 --> 36:51.115
Asshole!

36:53.086 --> 36:57.000
But now, Captain Harris,
if you'll take a seat.

37:01.261 --> 37:04.220
Perhaps a different seat.

37:06.808 --> 37:10.472
We've got to stop feeling sorry
for ourselves.

37:10.687 --> 37:12.724
Now, so far...

37:12.897 --> 37:18.689
...this gang seems to be confining
its robberies to our precinct.

37:18.862 --> 37:23.323
- You got something, Nick?
- No, no. I'm just taking some notes.

37:23.491 --> 37:27.235
Captain Harris, the mayor wants
to see you as soon as possible.

37:27.412 --> 37:31.247
The mayor would like to see me.

37:31.833 --> 37:34.917
Well, don't keep him waiting.

37:41.509 --> 37:44.092
If you'll excuse me.

37:46.347 --> 37:48.134
Proctor!

37:55.273 --> 37:57.606
I want a complete report
on this sprinkler system.

37:57.776 --> 37:59.859
- Sprinklers?
- Sprinklers.

38:03.198 --> 38:06.942
Good afternoon. How are you?
So nice to see you. Hello. Hello.

38:07.118 --> 38:12.489
Welcome to America. A great country.
Thank you. Thank you very much.

38:19.881 --> 38:21.588
Seven?

38:31.976 --> 38:35.390
Harris. Don't bother to rise.

38:37.732 --> 38:41.225
A whole lot of glue,
but not an ounce of love.

38:41.402 --> 38:43.769
Have any progress to report,
Captain Harris?

38:43.947 --> 38:47.611
Well, actually, I'm afraid not, sir.
We're at a bit of a standstill.

38:47.784 --> 38:53.655
We are re-questioning all the witnesses,
but that, of course, is basic procedure.

38:53.915 --> 38:56.874
This is not what I want to hear,
Captain Harris.

38:57.502 --> 38:59.744
I wanna hear that these crooks
have been--

39:00.505 --> 39:03.589
- The thing when you put the cuffs on--
- Caught!

39:03.883 --> 39:08.298
- Caught. That's exactly right. Caught.
- I'm trying, sir. I really am.

39:08.471 --> 39:12.010
But it's not easy with Lassard
and his men slowing me down.

39:12.183 --> 39:16.097
Yes, that business with the armored car.
That was a mess.

39:16.271 --> 39:20.436
Do you have any other complaints
against them at all?

39:20.608 --> 39:21.974
Not yet, Your Eminence.

39:22.151 --> 39:25.610
But I know Lassard and his nephew
are up to something.

39:25.947 --> 39:29.531
- And I am going to find out what!
- What?

39:30.326 --> 39:34.787
- That's what I'm going to find out.
- All right, let's get cracking!

39:34.956 --> 39:36.697
- Yes, sir!
- Let's get this case moving!

39:36.875 --> 39:38.207
- Yes, sir!
- Go!

39:38.376 --> 39:40.117
Yes, sir!

39:43.631 --> 39:48.501
Midge, find out why Harris
has got a chair on his ass.

39:50.430 --> 39:51.762
Whoo!

39:52.682 --> 39:56.301
Come on, Nick,
we've been here since noon.

39:56.477 --> 40:01.518
- You haven't told us what we're doing.
- Look, you guys just have to trust me.

40:04.235 --> 40:07.945
- May I help you, sir?
- I got my eye on that necklace there.

40:08.114 --> 40:10.527
It is beautiful. Shall I show it to you?

40:10.700 --> 40:14.319
No, thank you. I'll get it myself.

40:14.495 --> 40:18.660
All right, all right, all right. Stay calm.

40:23.588 --> 40:26.001
Sorry about the mess.

40:31.346 --> 40:35.181
Okay, now,
where do you hide your safe?

40:36.267 --> 40:39.556
- Call me when you're ready.
- Back room, behind the painting.

40:39.729 --> 40:41.641
Thank you.

40:47.528 --> 40:49.736
Thank you.

40:52.033 --> 40:53.365
We'll just be a minute.

40:55.411 --> 40:58.700
- Excuse me, coming through.
- I don't know them.

40:58.873 --> 41:00.956
- How'd you know?
- I don't get it yet...

41:01.125 --> 41:04.869
...but for some reason, the robberies
follow the old 51 bus route.

41:05.046 --> 41:09.336
- Get back here!
- Criminals, ho!

41:17.225 --> 41:18.887
Oh, crapola.

41:21.854 --> 41:23.140
Let's go, Proctor!

41:27.360 --> 41:31.229
Freeze! Freeze!
You're under arrest! Hands up!

41:31.406 --> 41:34.490
Harris, you're in the line of fire.
Get out of the way!

41:34.659 --> 41:36.992
Sure, you'd like that, wouldn't you?

41:37.161 --> 41:40.495
Well, let me tell you something,
Sergeant Lassard.

41:40.665 --> 41:44.033
I happen to be captain of this precinct,
and I am perfectly--

41:52.427 --> 41:53.918
Let's go, Proctor!

41:54.429 --> 41:56.295
Yeehaw!

41:56.514 --> 42:02.260
- All units, attention. Robbery in progress.
- I hurt my hand. Let's go! Go!

42:11.779 --> 42:15.944
That was very exciting, wasn't it?

42:24.959 --> 42:26.871
- He shoots.
- Air ball.

42:44.562 --> 42:46.349
<i>As I was saying...</i>

42:46.522 --> 42:49.606
<i>...I wanted to praise the cunning
and skill you showed...</i>

42:49.776 --> 42:52.314
<i>...in evading almost certain capture.</i>

42:52.487 --> 42:54.479
What happened there?

42:54.864 --> 42:59.234
<i>That fool Lassard and his team
are getting too close.</i>

42:59.410 --> 43:01.823
You want we should take care of them?

43:01.996 --> 43:05.660
<i>No. Leave them to me.</i>

43:07.251 --> 43:10.039
- Yuck!
- Watch it, it's Fackler.

43:10.588 --> 43:12.580
Watch it!

43:20.723 --> 43:24.637
- Thought we weren't meeting till later.
- Hurst called a special meeting.

43:24.811 --> 43:28.851
- For what?
- Makes me nervous. Harris is too happy.

43:29.023 --> 43:32.482
You're probably jumping to conclusions.

43:35.029 --> 43:39.740
- I could be wrong.
- Officers, be seated.

43:46.999 --> 43:51.164
This is not going to be pleasant,
so we'll get right to the point.

43:51.337 --> 43:55.877
From the beginning, we've suspected
that there was a leak in this precinct.

43:56.050 --> 43:59.214
This morning,
acting on an anonymous tip...

43:59.387 --> 44:04.758
...Captain Harris and I personally
searched one of your offices.

44:05.393 --> 44:08.431
I'm afraid we found
what we were looking for.

44:08.604 --> 44:12.063
This jewelry has been identified
as stolen merchandise...

44:12.233 --> 44:16.728
...from the Wilson Heights Gang's
last robbery.

44:17.822 --> 44:23.819
The office belonged
to Commandant Eric Lassard.

44:29.167 --> 44:33.002
To tell the truth, we were shocked.

44:33.337 --> 44:34.748
You're shocked?

44:34.964 --> 44:39.425
We have no choice but to suspend
Commandant Lassard and his team...

44:39.594 --> 44:43.964
...from active duty,
pending an investigation...

44:44.140 --> 44:46.257
An investigation.

44:46.434 --> 44:47.720
Yes.

44:47.894 --> 44:49.806
Good day, gentlemen.

44:50.605 --> 44:54.770
Excuse me. And of course, lady.
Ladies, two of them.

44:54.942 --> 44:58.185
And good day to you, Your Excellency.

44:59.155 --> 45:02.068
You are all dismissed.

45:55.670 --> 45:58.037
We're just gonna sit here and do nothing?

45:58.214 --> 46:00.297
What can we do? We're suspended.

46:00.466 --> 46:04.085
To pursue this case
would be disobeying a direct order.

46:04.262 --> 46:06.345
- We can lose our jobs.
- Wait a minute.

46:06.847 --> 46:10.682
A man's being falsely accused here.
Doesn't that count for anything?

46:10.977 --> 46:15.142
She's right. We've got to clear
Commandant Lassard.

46:15.314 --> 46:20.150
- No one else can.
- He's the reason we have these jobs.

46:21.195 --> 46:23.312
He'd do the same for us.

46:23.864 --> 46:26.527
You're right. Let's go.

46:56.397 --> 46:58.104
So, what are we looking for?

46:58.274 --> 47:01.017
I don't know, some connection.

47:01.193 --> 47:05.358
Why are these robberies taking place
along the old number 51 bus route?

47:06.157 --> 47:08.240
What's so special about that route?

47:08.409 --> 47:12.528
- Shall I bring it up on the screen?
- Yeah, let's take a look at it.

47:14.749 --> 47:19.585
Oops. Wrong file.
These are the intercity Railink plans.

47:19.754 --> 47:23.589
They must have moved the old
bus routes to a different file.

47:23.758 --> 47:27.843
No, no, no. Wait a minute.
Maybe this isn't the wrong file.

47:28.012 --> 47:30.846
I'll tell you what, try cross-referencing
the old bus route...

47:31.015 --> 47:34.133
...against the proposed Railink system
and see what you come up with.

47:34.310 --> 47:35.926
Okay.

47:42.109 --> 47:43.850
It matches perfectly.

47:44.028 --> 47:48.443
Yes, but why is the Wilson Heights Gang
robbing stores along the Railink?

47:48.616 --> 47:53.031
What happens when a section of town
becomes a high-crime area?

47:53.454 --> 47:56.242
- The property is devalued.
- Right.

47:56.415 --> 47:59.032
Why would somebody want
to devalue the property?

47:59.627 --> 48:02.119
- So they can buy it.
- Exactly.

48:02.380 --> 48:05.373
The property along the Railink system
is very valuable.

48:05.716 --> 48:09.209
Now, whoever owns that property
is gonna be very, very rich.

48:09.970 --> 48:12.883
Find out if anyone's buying property
along that route.

48:13.057 --> 48:15.265
I'm way ahead of you.

48:15.434 --> 48:16.766
<i>Good evening, gentlemen.</i>

48:16.936 --> 48:22.477
<i>Tonight our devious plan
becomes a fearful reality.</i>

48:22.942 --> 48:27.937
<i>All that remains is for me
to give my final command.</i>

48:28.114 --> 48:33.075
<i>Begin Operation Chaos.</i>

48:34.078 --> 48:37.162
<i>You boys are awfully quiet tonight.</i>

48:38.124 --> 48:44.166
Oh, well, sir, this is probably going
to be our last official meeting with you.

48:44.338 --> 48:47.502
We wanted you to know
what a privilege it's been for us...

48:47.675 --> 48:51.715
...to work with a criminal genius
such as yourself.

48:51.887 --> 48:54.721
As a matter of fact, we got you...

48:54.890 --> 49:00.431
...a pathetic little something here
to express our admiration...

49:00.604 --> 49:02.971
...our respect, sir, and our--

49:03.399 --> 49:05.766
<i>Just put it in the drawer, boy.</i>

49:07.862 --> 49:10.821
It's Cuban.

49:12.741 --> 49:16.325
<i>I thank you. I'm touched.</i>

49:16.495 --> 49:18.908
<i>Why, this is the perfect way...</i>

49:19.081 --> 49:24.543
<i>...for me to celebrate
this victorious moment.</i>

49:37.933 --> 49:40.721
<i>Funny. Very funny.</i>

49:45.232 --> 49:47.849
It's no good.
I don't know the code word.

49:48.027 --> 49:51.361
- The computer won't let me get the file.
- We're so close.

49:51.530 --> 49:53.738
We've gotta do something.

49:57.119 --> 49:58.451
Yes, sir.

49:58.621 --> 50:01.614
Hey, brother,
you really are computer friendly.

50:01.957 --> 50:05.291
Okay. "Clayton Plating."

50:11.133 --> 50:15.924
Ah-ha! Radio-controlled detonators.

50:17.181 --> 50:18.547
Dynamite.

50:19.433 --> 50:21.049
Douglas.

50:27.316 --> 50:29.729
- Oh, no.
- What, another robbery?

50:29.902 --> 50:32.110
No, it's worse.

50:32.279 --> 50:36.114
They've got the blueprints
and the firepower to shut the city down.

50:47.044 --> 50:50.958
Party Guys to Birthday Boy.
The candles are lit.

50:51.131 --> 50:53.088
Make a wish.

51:26.250 --> 51:29.869
Come on. Come on. Come on.

51:40.764 --> 51:42.801
Make up your mind.
I'm out of here!

51:44.310 --> 51:45.846
What are you doing?

52:06.457 --> 52:08.744
We better check this out.

52:13.339 --> 52:15.672
Ladies and gentlemen,
please just calm down.

52:15.841 --> 52:19.380
There's no need to be alarmed.
Just take your seats.

52:27.811 --> 52:32.181
Ladies and gentlemen, the Metropolitan
Police Department proudly presents me.

52:33.984 --> 52:35.441
Ow!

52:35.611 --> 52:38.604
- Sorry, Donald.
- Ah, phooey!

52:41.325 --> 52:43.066
- Okay, come on.
- There you go.

52:43.243 --> 52:45.860
- Hey, here comes a portable.
- Yeah, right.

52:48.916 --> 52:51.078
Yeah, give me that one.

52:52.086 --> 52:54.078
Yeah.

52:57.966 --> 53:00.754
Nice night, isn't it, officers?

53:05.599 --> 53:07.261
Hey, baby.

53:07.434 --> 53:10.768
Rock 'n' roll is the answer, baby.
Because I know what you need.

53:10.938 --> 53:13.772
Because I'm gonna give you what you need.

53:31.917 --> 53:33.658
Great.

54:08.036 --> 54:10.494
Thank you very much. Good night.

54:15.544 --> 54:18.002
Come on, Nick, let's go.

54:31.143 --> 54:34.227
Officers need assistance.

54:35.898 --> 54:37.935
The batteries are dead.

54:38.192 --> 54:41.105
You better go on foot. Now.

54:45.657 --> 54:49.526
Hey, baby.
Why don't you just put that gun away.

54:49.703 --> 54:52.616
Maybe we can have ourselves a little party.

54:52.873 --> 54:54.739
Okay.

55:04.885 --> 55:07.298
Who wants to go first?

55:25.030 --> 55:26.862
Looks like she doesn't need us.

55:31.995 --> 55:34.408
- She's good.
- All right.

55:37.251 --> 55:39.038
My...

55:39.378 --> 55:41.495
What a big gun.

55:54.268 --> 55:58.228
Oh, boy, oh, boy, oh, boy.

56:01.483 --> 56:04.191
Oh, crapola!

56:10.617 --> 56:13.951
He can be such a baby.

56:21.086 --> 56:25.251
This is Sergeant Lassard, requesting
all available units to Galena and Main.

56:25.424 --> 56:27.416
Galena and Main.

57:01.418 --> 57:03.410
Over here.

57:05.714 --> 57:08.252
- What's up?
- The Wilson Heights Gang is down there.

57:16.266 --> 57:19.134
- What's the situation?
- The gang is getting away.

57:19.311 --> 57:22.145
So, what are we waiting for?

57:26.860 --> 57:29.694
I'll just get a few things from my cycle.

57:42.125 --> 57:44.333
Tack, you ready?

57:49.341 --> 57:53.210
- I'm ready.
- Let's go kick some butt.

58:08.443 --> 58:10.981
- Let's check it out.
- All right, be careful.

58:11.154 --> 58:13.191
I'm gonna see where this tunnel goes.

58:47.649 --> 58:49.015
Look who's here.

58:50.819 --> 58:53.186
Here one minute, gone the next.

59:01.288 --> 59:02.620
How about you?

59:03.498 --> 59:06.741
I just thought I'd keep you company.
You into heavy metal?

59:33.820 --> 59:35.982
Now I'm mad.

01:00:19.241 --> 01:00:21.198
Sorry.

01:00:22.452 --> 01:00:24.569
You're under arrest!

01:00:24.746 --> 01:00:29.958
Throw down your weapon
and come out with your hands up!

01:00:34.047 --> 01:00:37.381
I take that as a "no."

01:01:00.657 --> 01:01:04.150
Ha! You're weakening. I'm stronger.

01:01:04.327 --> 01:01:06.910
No, it's your breath.

01:01:12.252 --> 01:01:14.995
- Knock, knock.
- Who's there?

01:01:15.672 --> 01:01:19.256
- Boo.
- Boo who?

01:01:19.676 --> 01:01:22.464
Quit crying.
This will be over in a moment.

01:01:22.637 --> 01:01:25.550
- That's it!
- Huh?

01:01:26.141 --> 01:01:31.637
Fighting is one thing, but bad jokes
is where I draw the line.

01:01:59.299 --> 01:02:02.838
This time it's you and me.
Leave the dog out of it.

01:02:03.011 --> 01:02:05.674
Okay, let's see what you got.

01:02:05.847 --> 01:02:07.429
All right.

01:02:15.607 --> 01:02:17.473
Airline pilot, huh?

01:02:55.063 --> 01:02:58.272
All right, let's finish it.

01:03:26.845 --> 01:03:28.381
Damn you!

01:03:52.662 --> 01:03:54.324
What the hell are you made of?

01:04:04.883 --> 01:04:06.590
Target: human.

01:04:06.760 --> 01:04:09.503
Mission: destroy.

01:04:09.888 --> 01:04:11.754
My God, you're a robot!

01:04:11.931 --> 01:04:16.016
"My God, you're a robot!
My God, you're a robot!"

01:04:20.065 --> 01:04:23.604
- Please, don't kill me!
- "Please, don't kill me!"

01:04:24.986 --> 01:04:27.228
"Please, don't kill me!"

01:04:38.875 --> 01:04:40.992
Rest now, human.

01:05:02.649 --> 01:05:04.436
Furlinger Magnum Special.

01:05:16.830 --> 01:05:19.163
Hey, you're pretty good.

01:05:19.541 --> 01:05:21.498
I'm the best.

01:05:27.298 --> 01:05:28.755
Cute.

01:05:41.521 --> 01:05:46.016
You know, this has been a lot of fun,
but I have to place you under arrest.

01:05:46.192 --> 01:05:48.400
You wouldn't shoot...

01:05:49.612 --> 01:05:51.444
...an unarmed man, would you?

01:06:42.290 --> 01:06:45.624
<i>Welcome, Sergeant Lassard.</i>

01:06:46.169 --> 01:06:48.912
- So you know me.
<i>- Oh, yes, indeed.</i>

01:06:49.088 --> 01:06:53.048
Whatever you're paying your informer,
it's not enough.

01:06:53.551 --> 01:06:58.467
<i>Your cohorts are causing me
very great annoyance.</i>

01:06:58.640 --> 01:07:03.635
<i>As we speak, my associates
are finishing off your friends.</i>

01:07:03.811 --> 01:07:07.555
<i>And now I'm going to finish you.</i>

01:07:12.820 --> 01:07:14.152
Poison gas?

01:07:14.864 --> 01:07:17.698
Oh, come on, give me a break.

01:07:17.867 --> 01:07:22.828
<i>Yes, melodramatic, I know,
but effective.</i>

01:07:22.997 --> 01:07:25.740
<i>Goodbye, Sergeant Lassard,
and take care.</i>

01:07:27.544 --> 01:07:29.957
<i>That's a nasty little cough you have.</i>

01:07:35.176 --> 01:07:37.088
That's not gonna do it.

01:07:42.141 --> 01:07:43.473
Help!

01:07:44.143 --> 01:07:45.475
Help!

01:07:55.405 --> 01:07:57.146
You okay?

01:08:01.327 --> 01:08:02.784
As you were, sergeant.

01:08:04.539 --> 01:08:06.121
Thanks.

01:08:07.250 --> 01:08:08.582
Now, where's Mr. Big?

01:08:32.524 --> 01:08:34.232
We better split up.

01:08:36.194 --> 01:08:37.652
Oh!

01:08:58.551 --> 01:09:00.258
Man...

01:09:00.470 --> 01:09:01.881
Come on.

01:09:03.723 --> 01:09:05.589
You got anything?

01:09:06.559 --> 01:09:08.140
I think we lost him.

01:09:09.895 --> 01:09:11.636
I think we found him.

01:09:24.035 --> 01:09:26.743
<i>The perpetrator's attempting escape...</i>

01:09:26.912 --> 01:09:28.198
<i>...west on Foundry.</i>

01:09:28.372 --> 01:09:31.616
Sir, Lieutenant Hightower's chasing
the perpetrator our way!

01:09:31.792 --> 01:09:34.831
Well, what are you waiting for?
Let's get out of here!

01:09:38.591 --> 01:09:41.254
<i>Repeat: west on Foundry Street.</i>

01:09:41.426 --> 01:09:45.136
<i>I am pursuing in a commandeered
civilian vehicle.</i>

01:09:48.685 --> 01:09:50.095
Tack!

01:09:50.269 --> 01:09:52.180
Tack! Jones!

01:09:52.438 --> 01:09:54.555
I got him! He's in the truck!

01:09:54.732 --> 01:09:56.018
Come on!

01:10:10.039 --> 01:10:12.281
Anybody know how to drive one of these?

01:10:12.542 --> 01:10:16.456
Affirmative, sir!
We took one on our honeymoon.

01:10:17.797 --> 01:10:20.790
Y'all hang tight.
Paddy wagon will be by in a minute.

01:10:21.050 --> 01:10:22.416
See y'all later.

01:10:22.593 --> 01:10:25.176
Yeehaw!

01:10:25.430 --> 01:10:26.716
Yeehaw!

01:10:46.284 --> 01:10:47.946
I don't see anything, Proctor.

01:10:48.202 --> 01:10:51.536
Well, this is Foundry Street.
I heard Hightower on the radio.

01:10:51.706 --> 01:10:55.370
You must have been mistaken,
because there is nothing going on here.

01:11:13.311 --> 01:11:15.678
I do not believe it!

01:11:22.153 --> 01:11:25.737
Shoot. Don't say it, Proctor!

01:11:25.907 --> 01:11:29.617
Just don't say it.

01:11:36.209 --> 01:11:40.374
- Told him so.
- I heard that!

01:12:07.573 --> 01:12:09.860
I don't care where it's going.
I'm getting on.

01:12:14.956 --> 01:12:18.745
- What are you doing?
- I'm picking up passengers.

01:12:18.918 --> 01:12:20.250
Why?

01:12:20.419 --> 01:12:23.457
Well, I have to, sir.
They're on my route.

01:12:24.131 --> 01:12:26.794
Let's go! Move it, move it, move it!

01:12:26.968 --> 01:12:29.426
Let's move! Go! Go! Go!

01:12:29.595 --> 01:12:32.838
Sit down! Let's go!

01:13:14.974 --> 01:13:16.465
You know what you're doing?

01:13:16.642 --> 01:13:18.929
Relax, I do this all the time.

01:13:38.956 --> 01:13:41.073
Look out!

01:14:45.314 --> 01:14:46.600
Welcome aboard, cowboy!

01:14:46.774 --> 01:14:48.060
- Woo-hoo!
- Whoo!

01:14:48.693 --> 01:14:51.026
He had a lot of trouble with that landing.

01:14:51.195 --> 01:14:53.027
I'll give it a nine.

01:15:01.580 --> 01:15:04.573
Look out for Gene & Roger's Fruit Stand!

01:15:04.750 --> 01:15:07.743
Get out of here, you maniac!

01:15:16.971 --> 01:15:20.180
- Have a nice evening, sir.
- Yeah, sure.

01:15:21.267 --> 01:15:24.931
You're much better than the regular driver.

01:15:28.774 --> 01:15:32.267
"You're much better
than the regular driver."

01:15:51.380 --> 01:15:54.714
- There go the lights.
- All right! Let's go!

01:16:10.232 --> 01:16:11.643
What are you doing here?

01:16:12.735 --> 01:16:14.146
Well...

01:16:14.487 --> 01:16:18.106
...we chased the mastermind
into this office, sir.

01:16:18.532 --> 01:16:22.321
Well, he isn't here.
So get out there and find him!

01:16:22.620 --> 01:16:24.111
Yes, sir.

01:16:27.208 --> 01:16:29.245
What are you doing here?

01:16:30.002 --> 01:16:31.868
That man is an imposter!

01:16:32.171 --> 01:16:33.662
Me?

01:16:34.673 --> 01:16:37.006
No, he's the imposter!

01:16:37.176 --> 01:16:41.466
Okay, make way! Make way here!
Move it, move it! Commissioner Hurst...

01:16:41.639 --> 01:16:46.600
...they have violated their suspensions.
I demand they be brought up on charges!

01:16:46.769 --> 01:16:49.637
- Oh, Harris, shut up!
- Oh, shut up, Harris!

01:16:50.314 --> 01:16:53.478
Well, one of these guys is the mastermind.

01:17:01.158 --> 01:17:02.990
But which one?

01:17:07.039 --> 01:17:11.875
There's only one sure way to find out,
and that's the Pinocchio test.

01:17:14.672 --> 01:17:17.540
That was it. Sorry, commissioner.

01:17:35.276 --> 01:17:36.733
Whoo!

01:17:38.070 --> 01:17:40.062
Hello, guys and gals!

01:17:40.239 --> 01:17:44.654
Oh, boy. I wish I had a picture
of your stupid faces.

01:17:45.452 --> 01:17:47.569
Mr. Mayor!

01:17:47.746 --> 01:17:50.454
Hello, Harris, you stupid twit!

01:17:50.624 --> 01:17:55.836
Thank you for all the info when you were
trying to catch me. I found it so useful.

01:17:56.046 --> 01:17:57.708
Woo-hoo!

01:17:58.257 --> 01:18:00.089
Harris was the leak?

01:18:00.718 --> 01:18:03.927
I didn't know!
I mean, he was the mayor. I mean--

01:18:04.096 --> 01:18:06.258
- How was I supposed to know?
- Why?

01:18:06.432 --> 01:18:07.764
For money, sir.

01:18:07.933 --> 01:18:11.426
He knew property along the
Railink route would be very valuable.

01:18:11.770 --> 01:18:15.354
So he had his gang set up a crime wave
to devalue the property...

01:18:15.941 --> 01:18:17.682
...so he could buy it up, cheap.

01:18:17.860 --> 01:18:21.524
With the damage that blackout caused,
well, he was gonna own it all.

01:18:22.031 --> 01:18:24.273
He'd just sit back,
stop the crime wave...

01:18:24.450 --> 01:18:28.285
...retire from public service
and watch his property skyrocket.

01:18:28.913 --> 01:18:32.281
You mean this was all
just a real-estate scam?

01:18:32.458 --> 01:18:34.620
A billion-dollar real-estate scam, sir.

01:18:34.835 --> 01:18:36.292
Hee!

01:18:36.587 --> 01:18:37.919
Take him away.

01:18:38.088 --> 01:18:41.957
Take me away? Oh, how rude!
How rude! Whoo!

01:18:42.301 --> 01:18:44.088
Take yourselves away. Try that!

01:18:44.261 --> 01:18:49.006
As a matter of fact, you're all fired.
Each and every one of you is fired. Fired!

01:18:49.183 --> 01:18:51.926
And don't you touch my model ships!
Not one of you!

01:18:52.102 --> 01:18:54.765
Don't touch them!
The little men are so delicate.

01:18:54.939 --> 01:18:57.556
They'll crumble
between your big, fat fingers!

01:18:57.733 --> 01:19:00.271
Your big cop fingers!

01:19:00.486 --> 01:19:06.278
Eric, I owe you and the team an apology.
I've been a fool.

01:19:06.450 --> 01:19:07.782
Yes.

01:19:07.952 --> 01:19:10.069
But that's all right, commissioner.

01:19:10.246 --> 01:19:14.707
Consider yourself and your team reinstated.

01:19:16.210 --> 01:19:17.667
All right!

01:19:19.546 --> 01:19:23.506
And so it is with great honor
that I award these men and women...

01:19:23.676 --> 01:19:29.889
...the Distinguished Service Medal
for serving this city in its hour of need.

01:19:35.688 --> 01:19:39.898
Ladies and gentlemen,
our honored police officers.

01:19:55.207 --> 01:19:57.790
I think I'll take your seat, lieutenant.

01:19:58.127 --> 01:19:59.993
You take mine.

01:20:00.170 --> 01:20:01.706
Yes, sir.

01:20:04.008 --> 01:20:06.091
Unless there's some problem.

01:20:06.260 --> 01:20:08.673
Nope. No problem.

01:20:22.943 --> 01:20:24.400
Oh...

01:20:28.324 --> 01:20:29.656
Proctor.

01:20:30.409 --> 01:20:32.071
Oh, Proctor.

01:20:33.829 --> 01:20:36.071
Proctor!

01:20:57.561 --> 01:20:59.223
Proctor!
