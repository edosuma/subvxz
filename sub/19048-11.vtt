WEBVTT

00:03.462 --> 00:05.129
[Charlie] Now keep in mind,

00:05.214 --> 00:07.799
we've been locked in this parking garage
stairwell for, like, 20 minutes, dude.

00:07.883 --> 00:09.801
Okay, so then we turn
around, and what do we see?

00:09.927 --> 00:13.221
A scary homeless dude. And I'm, like, "Oh, shit!
" Yeah! And I'm like, uh...

00:13.305 --> 00:15.598
You know- I'm like, "What do we-
What do we do?" You know?

00:15.683 --> 00:19.143
And then Mac, he's just like, "Just chill.
" And I'm like, "How do we chill, dude?"

00:19.228 --> 00:21.104
Yeah. And I'm all, "Oh, shit!
He's gonna talk now!"

00:21.188 --> 00:23.439
Yeah. And I'm all like, "How do
you know he's gonna talk, bro?"

00:23.524 --> 00:26.025
And I'm like, "Because his mouth is opening.
" And then he did talk.

00:26.110 --> 00:28.611
Yeah. And then he goes- he goes, "I'll
let you out of the stairwell...

00:28.696 --> 00:32.949
'cause I have the key, because
I'm the security guard instead."

00:35.035 --> 00:36.244
That's a cool story, huh?
Yeah, right?

00:36.328 --> 00:37.829
Okay, so, uh...

00:37.955 --> 00:40.998
Just so I'm clear on the story
that you just told. Yeah.

00:41.125 --> 00:46.003
It was about you guys getting locked in a
garage stairwell for 20 or so minutes.

00:46.130 --> 00:47.588
Yeah. And then a security
guard came along...

00:47.673 --> 00:49.632
and the security guard
let you out.

00:49.717 --> 00:51.217
Well, yeah. But...

00:51.301 --> 00:53.469
I mean, it's how you tell the
story that makes it good.

00:53.554 --> 00:56.472
How you told the story
was by far the worst part of the story.

00:56.557 --> 00:57.890
You weren't even
paying attention to us, dude.

00:57.975 --> 00:59.600
All you were doing
was playing on that stupid phone.

00:59.685 --> 01:01.769
Why are you rubbing on the phone?
Let me rub on it.

01:01.854 --> 01:04.105
What are you doing?
No, no, no! Hey, hey, Frank!

01:04.188 --> 01:07.191
Get your greasy, fat, sausage fingers
of my touch screen phone.

01:07.317 --> 01:08.901
This thing's new.
My fingers are not greasy.

01:08.986 --> 01:12.321
Uh, you have four sausage links
in your pocket right now.

01:12.406 --> 01:14.532
Yeah, but I don't touch
the sausage links.

01:14.616 --> 01:18.828
Why should I do that when I can
let my shirt do the work? Watch.

01:18.954 --> 01:21.122
Hmm. No touching, and warm.
[Scoffs] My God. You're an animal.

01:21.248 --> 01:24.792
Guess what, boners. I just got a part in an M.
Night Shyamalan movie.

01:24.877 --> 01:26.919
- What?
- Yeah. I'm a featured actress,

01:27.004 --> 01:28.963
which means I'm gonna be
featured in a scene.

01:29.089 --> 01:31.591
What's an M. Night?
Wow. Gross.

01:31.675 --> 01:34.010
M. Night Shyamalan, the
Indian filmmaker from Philly.

01:34.094 --> 01:36.053
Oh, my God.
This dude's a big deal, Frank.

01:36.138 --> 01:38.514
He's like a true-to-life Slumdog Millionaire.
You know what I mean?

01:38.599 --> 01:41.601
He always puts some awesome twists at the
end of his movies to trick the audience.

01:41.685 --> 01:43.269
Oh, yeah, yeah,
like in The Sixth Sense.

01:43.353 --> 01:46.272
You find out that the dude in
that hairpiece the whole time...

01:46.356 --> 01:49.484
- That's Bruce Willis- the whole movie.
- That's not the twist.

01:49.610 --> 01:51.152
That's not the twist to that movie.
That wasn't?

01:51.278 --> 01:52.612
No.
I'll tell you about it later.

01:52.738 --> 01:54.781
There were a lot of twists in that movie.
Watch it again.

01:54.865 --> 01:56.824
You know what? You're gonna
need a very crafty agent...

01:56.909 --> 01:59.744
to squeeze everything
out of this slumdog.

01:59.870 --> 02:01.454
I volunteer.
And I decline.

02:01.538 --> 02:03.206
You are abusive
and you smell like warm meat...

02:03.290 --> 02:05.792
and I want you to leave me alone 'cause
this is really important for me.

02:05.876 --> 02:07.418
This is important
for all of us, okay?

02:07.503 --> 02:10.128
This is an opportunity for Charlie
and I to get M. Night our script.

02:10.255 --> 02:12.048
Right. Since when do you
and Charlie have a script?

02:12.132 --> 02:15.551
Since you walked in here and said you were
in that movie. We're great storytellers.

02:15.636 --> 02:18.179
No, goddamn it! No, come on.
Don't involve yourselves in this.

02:18.263 --> 02:21.516
Dee, you involved us in this the second you
walked in and told us about the movie.

02:21.642 --> 02:23.518
You really shouldn't have done that.
Let's get to work!

02:23.602 --> 02:24.769
Oh, oh, hoo!

02:24.853 --> 02:26.270
Let's get some beer. Dude.
Yeah!

03:05.519 --> 03:07.144
Goddamn it.

03:07.229 --> 03:09.063
Whoa, whoa. Excuse me.
Can I help you?

03:09.147 --> 03:12.191
Oh, great. Nonfat, sugar free,
vanilla soy latte. Three shots, no foam.

03:12.276 --> 03:15.069
Also, why don't you let me in here
so I can start my vocal warm-ups?

03:15.195 --> 03:17.405
I'm sorry. Who are you again?
Dee Reynolds, featured actress.

03:17.531 --> 03:18.698
Reynolds?
Yeah.

03:18.782 --> 03:20.366
And could you send
M. Night over also,

03:20.450 --> 03:23.160
because I have a couple questions
regarding the detes of my character.

03:23.287 --> 03:25.413
Right. Says you're a featured extra.
[Clicks Tongue]

03:25.497 --> 03:28.416
Okay. Well, featured extra, featured actress.
What's the difference?

03:28.500 --> 03:30.167
Well, the difference is...

03:30.252 --> 03:33.421
a featured actress usually auditions for
the role, has lines, gets a trailer,

03:33.505 --> 03:36.299
whereas a featured extra is a person
whose head shot we pull off a pile,

03:36.383 --> 03:39.093
has no lines and sits in that tent
over there till we're ready for her.

03:39.219 --> 03:41.387
Okay? Mmm. Okay.
Ah, ah, ah, ah...

03:42.472 --> 03:44.640
Where are we on
the coffee situation,

03:44.725 --> 03:47.059
because it's early
and I am hungover.

03:47.185 --> 03:48.811
Go sit in the tent. Now.
This tent?

03:48.937 --> 03:50.479
That one. Thank you.
Are you sure?

03:51.732 --> 03:53.482
[Charlie] This is hard.
Mmm.

03:53.609 --> 03:57.528
I mean, because I want the movie to be big,
you know, and, like, a box office smash...

03:57.613 --> 04:00.323
and we want to put, like,
a lot of meat in the seats, you know?

04:00.407 --> 04:02.575
Yeah. You know what I'm thinking, dude?
You know what I'm thinking?

04:02.659 --> 04:05.161
Something that's happening in
Hollywood that's, like, pretty cool.

04:05.245 --> 04:07.830
They take an underrated actor,
right, whose career is in a slump,

04:07.915 --> 04:09.498
and then they make him
a star again.

04:09.625 --> 04:11.792
Oh, that is awesome, right?
Yeah, let's do that. Yeah.

04:11.877 --> 04:15.212
Yeah. So, who is the most
underrated actor of all time?

04:15.297 --> 04:17.005
- It's Dolph Lundgren.
- Correct. Why?

04:17.089 --> 04:20.676
Well, because of his spiky hair, his
ice-cold demeanor and his big muscles.

04:20.761 --> 04:23.054
Absolutely. Okay. All right.
All right, so we have our actor.

04:23.138 --> 04:25.723
- Okay. - That's great.
Now we need a really great role for him.

04:25.807 --> 04:28.184
Oh, you know what I was thinking?
Scientists are cool.

04:28.268 --> 04:29.685
What if he's a scientist?

04:29.770 --> 04:32.772
Okay, okay. A muscular scientist.
I'm into that. Right.

04:32.898 --> 04:35.775
As long as we don't cover up that
body with a lab coat, bro. No, dude.

04:35.859 --> 04:37.944
He's wearing, like,
a hot mesh tank top.

04:38.028 --> 04:40.488
I like that. Now does he,
like, fight crime or something?

04:40.572 --> 04:45.242
Yeah, yeah, yeah. He fights crime,
uh, with his brain and his brawn.

04:45.327 --> 04:47.119
Should we be writing this down?
Let's get all this down.

04:47.245 --> 04:48.663
[Laughing] All right.
This is good. All right.

04:48.789 --> 04:51.082
Okay. Brains-
Brawn...

04:51.208 --> 04:52.541
Brawn-
Muscles...

04:52.668 --> 04:56.337
Oh! Dude!
Yeah?

04:56.421 --> 04:58.631
I just got a Shyamalan twist
to put in this bad boy.

04:58.715 --> 05:00.216
Okay. Lay it on me.

05:00.300 --> 05:03.761
What if this scientist
runs around on all fours?

05:03.845 --> 05:05.638
Why would he run on all fours?

05:05.722 --> 05:10.017
It's a science experiment with a
dog that goes absolutely haywire.

05:10.102 --> 05:15.147
Suddenly he wakes up with the ability
to run around like a hound. You know?

05:15.232 --> 05:18.859
We're not making the lead of our
big-budget action movie half dog!

05:18.944 --> 05:20.903
No, not half dog. He's all dog.

05:22.239 --> 05:24.365
Then why are we casting
Dolph Lundgren?

05:24.449 --> 05:25.825
That will be the twist.

05:25.909 --> 05:29.120
Dolph Lundgren will be
the voice of this dog.

05:29.204 --> 05:31.831
That's not a twist!
That's a completely different movie...

05:31.915 --> 05:34.750
about a talking-dog scientist
with the voice of Dolph Lundgren!

05:34.835 --> 05:36.669
All right. You know what?
Check this out.

05:36.753 --> 05:40.006
What if it's a man with a few dog-like qualities,
like, uh, heightened sense of smell...

05:40.132 --> 05:42.717
Jesus Christ, Charlie.
We're not- There's no- or licking...

05:42.801 --> 05:44.885
Whoa, whoa. Wait a second.
A heightened sense of smell?

05:44.970 --> 05:47.430
What if he can smell crime?

05:48.932 --> 05:50.891
What if he smells crime?

05:51.018 --> 05:52.351
Dude, dude, dude, dude, dude, dude!
Yeah?

05:52.436 --> 05:55.438
What if he can smell a crime
before it even happens?

05:55.522 --> 05:58.607
Holy shit, dude. That's amazing.
Smells crime before it even happens!

05:58.692 --> 06:00.109
Yes, dude!

06:00.235 --> 06:03.612
We're getting somewhere.
What if his entire head is just one big nose?

06:03.697 --> 06:06.157
Write that down!
I like that!

06:06.241 --> 06:08.909
He's one big nose
on Dolph Lundgren's body.

06:08.994 --> 06:10.578
Oh, shit!

06:14.916 --> 06:16.083
Ho!
What?

06:16.168 --> 06:19.420
No. No, no, no, no, no.
What are you two doing here?

06:19.504 --> 06:22.048
Well, since you've declined
my offer to be your agent,

06:22.132 --> 06:24.800
I've since taken on Dennis
as a client.

06:24.885 --> 06:27.678
Dennis has that
"I don't give a shit" attitude,

06:27.763 --> 06:29.513
which is perfect for
Hollywood, right, Dennis?

06:29.639 --> 06:31.515
I-I- I really don't care.
See? See?

06:31.600 --> 06:33.309
Why do you want to be
everybody's agent?

06:33.393 --> 06:35.895
Because that's where the money is.
What do you do?

06:35.979 --> 06:38.230
You just put things together.
You sit back, you collect 10%...

06:38.315 --> 06:39.899
and you let the client
do all the work.

06:39.983 --> 06:41.358
Dennis doesn't give a shit.
Right?

06:41.485 --> 06:43.444
Stop talking to me.
Perfect.

06:43.528 --> 06:46.072
Okay. Well, you can't just walk in
here and get a part in the movie.

06:46.156 --> 06:47.448
It's not how it works.

06:47.574 --> 06:49.033
Excuse me, sir?
Yes?

06:49.159 --> 06:52.620
Uh, could my client have a part
in your movie? Sure. Here.

06:52.746 --> 06:54.038
Fill out this form.
You do it.

06:54.122 --> 06:55.956
I'll do it.
Unbelievable!

06:56.041 --> 06:58.292
Hold on a second.
Hey, hey. Assistant, hey.

06:58.376 --> 07:00.336
Hi. When is somebody
gonna tell me what my part is?

07:00.462 --> 07:04.173
What is your name again? Dee Reynolds.
I'm your featured... extra.

07:04.257 --> 07:05.424
Right. You're a corpse.

07:05.550 --> 07:07.218
A corpse?
Mm-hmm.

07:07.302 --> 07:11.472
Like a... zombie roaming through the
streets looking for brains kind of corpse?

07:11.598 --> 07:13.349
No. Like a dead corpse.
Just a dead corpse?

07:13.475 --> 07:15.684
Lifeless body lying in the street.
Okay. All right.

07:15.811 --> 07:17.978
We'll call you when we're ready for makeup.
I know, but...

07:18.063 --> 07:20.731
Hold on a second. I have one more-
Don't be- Don't walk away from me.

07:20.857 --> 07:22.566
He just- He'll be back.
Dee.

07:22.651 --> 07:24.944
Jesus, you come off
so desperate.

07:25.070 --> 07:28.405
Oh! Hollywood!
Hollywood! Hollywood!

07:28.532 --> 07:30.366
No, no, no, no, no, no, no!
No! Hey, guys.

07:30.450 --> 07:33.911
Get out of here! What is that?
What are you guys doing here?

07:34.037 --> 07:35.496
We in a Hollywood situation!
Yeah.

07:35.580 --> 07:37.915
- Dennis just got a part in the movie.
- Sweet, dude. Bump it.

07:37.999 --> 07:39.959
- Uh-
- Not gonna? All right.

07:40.043 --> 07:42.711
So, uh- So where's the slumdog?
We're ready for him.

07:42.796 --> 07:45.589
- You finished the script already?
- No, not exactly.

07:45.674 --> 07:47.633
Yeah, we, uh- We didn't want
to get locked into anything,

07:47.717 --> 07:49.218
so we came up
with a pitch instead.

07:49.302 --> 07:51.762
It's more like a series of ideas
in no particular order, you know?

07:51.847 --> 07:53.222
Yeah. We'll work out
the kinks later.

07:53.306 --> 07:55.349
So you hit a brick wall, huh?
Yeah. Uh...

07:55.433 --> 07:57.143
Mmm. Dennis can help you
with that.

07:57.269 --> 08:00.104
He is good at coming up with awesome words.
I wouldn't rule it out.

08:00.188 --> 08:02.982
You have to sign him on
as a producer. That okay?

08:03.108 --> 08:06.110
Dennis? You want to be a producer?
Yeah.

08:06.194 --> 08:07.987
- Sorry. - All right.
We'll work out the detes later, man.

08:08.071 --> 08:09.655
But maybe we gotta find,
like, a cooler place?

08:09.739 --> 08:11.323
Could we get a place
with some A.C. going?

08:11.449 --> 08:14.201
[Charlie] Let's have a meeting and some A.
C., man. Leave it to me.

08:16.371 --> 08:19.707
All right. You guys got 30 seconds.
Blow my mind.

08:19.833 --> 08:21.667
Okay, okay, okay, okay.
Oh, oh, oh.

08:21.751 --> 08:24.670
Guys, guys.
It's the prequel to The Sixth Sense.

08:24.754 --> 08:28.799
The Fifth Sense.
The sense of smell.

08:28.925 --> 08:31.385
## [Dramatic]
Imagine a super ripped,

08:31.469 --> 08:35.347
super smart scientist
in a mesh tank top...

08:35.432 --> 08:38.683
named Dr. Dolph Lundgren.

08:38.768 --> 08:40.269
No. That's-
That's not his name.

08:40.352 --> 08:42.313
He's played by Dolph Lundgren, but
that's not the character's name.

08:42.438 --> 08:45.191
It could be the character's name.
No, that's...

08:45.275 --> 08:47.818
A doctor played by Dolph
Lundgren named Dolph Lundgren?

08:47.944 --> 08:50.070
Yeah!
That's confusing, dude.

08:50.155 --> 08:53.073
More confusing than making up an
entirely new name for a person?

08:53.200 --> 08:55.534
That's gonna confuse people.
I'm taking over. I'm taking over.

08:55.619 --> 08:58.579
- You are losing me. - Okay. Okay.
All right, all right, all right.

08:58.663 --> 09:04.627
[Dramatic Voice] Imagine a super smart,
ripped scientist played by Dolph Lundgren,

09:04.711 --> 09:08.756
who, after a terrible accident
in his lab, blows off his nose!

09:08.840 --> 09:14.637
After reconstructive surgery, he soon realizes
that he smells something that stinks...

09:21.311 --> 09:23.938
[Recording Stops]
This doctor smells crime?

09:24.064 --> 09:26.482
Possibly also runs around like a hound.
No! He doesn't run...

09:26.608 --> 09:28.984
I'm just saying, don't rule it out.
It's possible- I didn't agree to that.

09:29.110 --> 09:32.196
It's not in any of our notes.
He might run around like a hound. What do you think?

09:32.280 --> 09:34.114
Okay, uh- All right.
First things first.

09:34.199 --> 09:36.700
You guys gotta type some of this shit out
and get organized, for Christ's sakes.

09:36.785 --> 09:39.078
Get your shit together. Come on.
I mean, that's ridiculous.

09:39.162 --> 09:44.750
Now in terms of the story, uh, clearly
it's brilliant. It's amazing.

09:44.876 --> 09:46.835
Great idea. Brilliant idea.
Thank you.

09:46.920 --> 09:49.380
But there is one critical
element that's missing.

09:49.464 --> 09:50.589
It needs a sexual punch-up.

09:50.674 --> 09:52.549
We need to get a female
lead character in there...

09:52.634 --> 09:54.969
that Dolph can bang
throughout the whole movie.

09:55.095 --> 09:57.846
Yeah. I kind of hate women though.
Oh.

09:57.973 --> 10:00.599
I feel like they just slow action
movies down too. Right, dude.

10:00.684 --> 10:02.935
No, Mac. See, you're dead wrong on that.
You're dead wrong.

10:03.019 --> 10:07.648
See, one of the problems with Shyamalan's
movies is that they lack a certain eroticism.

10:07.732 --> 10:09.775
What if we were to bring, uh,

10:09.859 --> 10:13.070
an incredibly hot but skeptical
female lab partner into the mix?

10:13.154 --> 10:16.782
And then that way, whenever Dolph's not out
busting heads because he's smelled crime,

10:16.866 --> 10:20.536
he's back at the lab performing
outrageous sexual experiments...

10:20.620 --> 10:22.955
on her supple, young body.

10:23.039 --> 10:26.041
Now here's the twist.
And there is a twist.

10:27.836 --> 10:30.629
We show it.

10:30.714 --> 10:32.339
We show all of it.

10:32.465 --> 10:36.885
Because what's the one major thing missing
from all action movies these days, guys?

10:38.430 --> 10:40.264
Full penetration.

10:40.348 --> 10:42.766
Guys, we're gonna show
full penetration,

10:42.892 --> 10:44.935
and we're gonna show a lot of it.
[All Chuckling]

10:45.020 --> 10:48.480
I mean, we're talking, you know,
graphic scenes of Dolph Lundgren...

10:48.565 --> 10:51.108
really going to town on
this hot, young lab tech...

10:51.192 --> 10:55.863
from behind, 69, anal, vaginal,
cowgirl, reverse cowgirl...

10:55.947 --> 10:58.157
All the hits. All the big ones.
All the good ones.

10:58.241 --> 11:00.367
And then he smells crime again.
He's out busting heads.

11:00.452 --> 11:02.953
Then he's back to the lab
for some more full penetration.

11:03.038 --> 11:05.622
He smells crime.
Back to the lab, full penetration.

11:05.707 --> 11:09.501
Crime, penetration, crime, full
penetration, crime, penetration.

11:09.586 --> 11:12.588
And this goes on and on and back
and forth for 90 or so minutes...

11:12.672 --> 11:15.174
until the movie
just sort of ends.

11:21.264 --> 11:22.848
That is brilliant!

11:22.932 --> 11:26.643
That is the most brilliant movie
I've ever heard in my life.

11:26.728 --> 11:32.483
I think audiences are gonna be very uncomfortable
seeing Dolph Lundgren's naked penis...

11:32.567 --> 11:35.736
going into this young girl
that you're talking about.

11:35.820 --> 11:39.031
Yeah. Just to be clear, though,
I don't care either way.

11:39.115 --> 11:40.699
Well, it was worth it,
you know- 30 seconds.

11:40.825 --> 11:43.619
Because we got the chick thing out of
it, so this is good. Yeah, 30 seconds.

11:43.703 --> 11:45.579
Okay. All right. Well, maybe
we should type this stuff up,

11:45.705 --> 11:47.581
and then, Frank, we'll be in touch.
Get it all together.

11:47.707 --> 11:49.208
We'll type it up.
We'll get another thing going.

11:49.334 --> 11:50.834
And think about the representation thing.
Definitely, dude. Definitely.

11:50.960 --> 11:53.087
Okay. You don't have to rep him.
You could just rep me.

11:53.171 --> 11:54.797
All right.
Let me just get all this stuff.

11:54.923 --> 11:56.423
We're not a writing team.
Okay. Are we good?

11:56.549 --> 11:57.508
Yeah. We're good.
Okay.

11:57.634 --> 11:58.884
Okay, we good?
Go ahead, Charlie.

11:58.968 --> 12:00.344
Okay. And we'll get-
we'll get the...

12:00.470 --> 12:02.388
Frank, I write better without him.
Seriously. We'll talk about it.

12:02.514 --> 12:03.889
You know? Okay.
[Muttering]

12:03.973 --> 12:04.973
Okay, cool.

12:09.354 --> 12:12.189
[Mac] The Fifth Sense.
Here we go. Here we go.

12:14.192 --> 12:17.486
Write-Write- Write a couple words.
The...

12:17.612 --> 12:19.696
Fifth-
Dude, go faster.

12:19.823 --> 12:21.240
Hold on. Hold on.
I can't- Go faster.

12:21.324 --> 12:22.658
Ah! I got it in my head.

12:22.784 --> 12:25.202
I just- I can't type it fast enough.
You can't type it at all.

12:25.286 --> 12:27.704
If I could type more better, then
I think it would come out faster.

12:27.831 --> 12:30.082
Maybe we should get somebody else
who can type. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.

12:30.166 --> 12:31.875
Look at her, dude.

12:31.960 --> 12:36.797
Might be good to have an older lady in the
mix, right, sort of a workhorse secretary?

12:36.881 --> 12:40.551
Yeah- I don't care for her demographic.
I find them judgmental.

12:40.677 --> 12:41.844
Mmm.
You know what I mean?

12:41.970 --> 12:43.804
Mm-hmm.
We need someone more our...

12:43.888 --> 12:45.347
Hello.

12:45.432 --> 12:48.267
Check out this one over here.
Does he look Indian to you?

12:48.351 --> 12:49.977
Oh, yes, dude.

12:50.061 --> 12:52.187
It would be great to have
an Indian in our corner, right?

12:52.272 --> 12:54.773
Oh, my God. They're natural storytellers.
They're great with twists.

12:54.858 --> 12:57.526
- Uh- Psst! Psst!
- Dude!

12:57.610 --> 13:00.946
- Uh, where are you from?
- Baltimore.

13:01.072 --> 13:03.282
[Clicks Tongue] Right, right.
Baltimore, sure.

13:03.366 --> 13:05.742
- Where are your parents from?
- Jersey.

13:05.869 --> 13:08.078
Oh. All right.
Getting nowhere here.

13:08.204 --> 13:10.289
Uh, you're so-
Yeah, well, uh...

13:11.458 --> 13:14.501
Is anyone in your
family from India? Mmm.

13:14.586 --> 13:17.754
- Pakistan.
- Pakistan. Now that's...

13:17.881 --> 13:19.756
Well, isn't-
a country somewhere, so...

13:19.883 --> 13:21.508
What's the difference between
that and- Yeah, what is...

13:21.593 --> 13:24.428
Well, they're right next to
each other, both countries.

13:24.554 --> 13:26.096
That's perfect.
Perfect.

13:26.222 --> 13:28.557
That's close enough, dude.
There's probably a lot of going back and forth.

13:28.641 --> 13:31.477
Yeah, Pakistanis are probably great with twists
too, in their own kind of way, you know?

13:31.561 --> 13:33.896
Great. How'd you like to be
in the movie business?

13:35.440 --> 13:37.232
Ma'am, how you doing on makeup in there?
We're ready.

13:37.317 --> 13:40.402
Well, I'm okay, but I feel like maybe
they used a little too much blood.

13:40.487 --> 13:43.989
Ma'am, we need to move here.
Let's go. Let's go.

13:44.073 --> 13:46.283
My gut feeling is
they went a little overboard.

13:46.409 --> 13:48.535
I mean, can you even tell that it's me?
Yeah. It's perfect.

13:48.620 --> 13:51.455
- We just need to pair you up with
a husband for the shot. - Husband?

13:51.581 --> 13:52.956
Yeah.
How about this guy right here?

13:53.082 --> 13:54.750
That'll work.
That'll work. [Cackles]

13:54.834 --> 13:56.168
Whoa!
Great.

13:56.252 --> 13:57.377
Holy shit, Dee.
This is like...

13:57.462 --> 13:59.129
Wow. I could barely tell
that was you.

13:59.214 --> 14:01.882
- I mean, did they dip you by your heels
into the blood? - That's ridiculous.

14:02.008 --> 14:03.592
That looks so stupid.
Uh...

14:03.676 --> 14:06.345
Frank had 'em go a little more subtle
with me, so you could see my face.

14:06.429 --> 14:08.222
This? This is it?
Yeah.

14:08.306 --> 14:09.723
How the hell
did you manage that?

14:09.849 --> 14:12.100
No, I'm working my ass of.

Get down now.

We are losing light, people. Let's go.

- I need you to turn over.
I need you face down. - Face down?

14:27.033 --> 14:29.368
Yes. No, 'cause then you won't
be able to see my face.

14:29.452 --> 14:33.872
Face down or in the pile of
bodies over there. You pick it.

14:33.957 --> 14:36.667
- Face down. - That's what I thought.
All right. Energy. Energy.

14:36.751 --> 14:38.627
But you're dead. Dead energy.
Dead energy. Here we go.

I get it. I get it.
Okay, so he's on the edge of this cliff...

14:41.839 --> 14:44.883
throwing his nose off into the ocean because
he's at the happiest point of his life.

14:44.968 --> 14:48.971
No, no, no, no, no, no. This is the
scientist's lowest point in the movie.

14:49.055 --> 14:52.724
Okay. Here. He throws his nose
of the cliff into the ocean...

14:52.809 --> 14:57.020
because he's- he's rejecting his
life as a savior of all of mankind.

14:57.105 --> 14:59.940
Oh, I finally just got it.

up with that? - Uh...

Come on, man.

15:24.549 --> 15:25.716

this whole movie real quick,

- Dennis, hey.

15:45.445 --> 15:48.447
We hit a wall on the pitch.
Uh, what pitch is that, man?

15:48.531 --> 15:51.783
- The pitch of the movie that you're a producer on.
- Oh, yeah. That thing. Yeah.

15:51.868 --> 15:54.494
- What's up with that?
- We realized that none of us are writers,

15:54.579 --> 15:57.623
so we decided to play to our
strengths and make a poster.

15:57.707 --> 16:01.126
What tells a person about a movie better
than a picture of what the movie is?

18:09.797 --> 18:11.423
Hey-oh!

18:11.507 --> 18:12.924
Hey, where his he, dude?
Where's Night?

18:13.050 --> 18:14.760
We got it!
Dude, we totally got it.

18:14.844 --> 18:16.344
Brace yourself!
Brace yourself!

18:23.853 --> 18:25.562
Oh, okay, yeah.
I get it. Get it?

18:25.646 --> 18:29.149
Yeah, I-I get it. Now, there is a lot
going on there with- with Dolph.

18:29.233 --> 18:31.943
We had to make some artistic compromises.
I think we're good with the body.

18:32.028 --> 18:34.905
Yeah, but it's a lovable character.
It's a lovable guy.

18:34.989 --> 18:36.448
You know, these are
good compromises.

18:36.532 --> 18:38.867
Bottom line, M. Night's gonna love it.
So where is he?

18:38.993 --> 18:41.912
Night? Uh, well-
Oh, he's not here.

18:41.996 --> 18:43.497
Jesus Christ, Dee.
What happened to you?

18:43.581 --> 18:45.791
He brought in a "B" team
or something like that,

18:45.875 --> 18:47.334
covered me all in blood.

18:47.418 --> 18:48.835
That slumdog bastard
twisted all of us!

18:48.961 --> 18:51.546
Oh, shit, dude.
We need him to execute our script. Yeah.

18:51.631 --> 18:54.508
Actually, you guys don't need
Shyamalan to execute your script...

18:54.592 --> 18:58.178
because I've got the mother of all
Shyamalan twists in my hand right here.

18:58.262 --> 19:00.806
You see, you think I've just been
playing with my phone the whole time,

19:00.890 --> 19:02.182
but you're wrong.

19:02.266 --> 19:03.892
Been writing a little
movie script of my own,

19:03.976 --> 19:06.061
and I finished it right
before you guys called.

19:06.145 --> 19:09.773
It's a horror movie about two men
trapped in a garage stairwell...

19:09.857 --> 19:12.901
who get hunted down by a
psychotic, homeless killer...

19:12.985 --> 19:18.073
who turns out to be
a security guard... instead.

19:18.157 --> 19:20.534
- That's our story, dude.
- Damn right, it's your story.

19:20.618 --> 19:22.994
And that's why you two guys
are gonna be attached as producers.

19:23.120 --> 19:24.830
Nice, baby!
Producers!

19:24.914 --> 19:26.373
All right!
I feel like that's...

19:26.499 --> 19:28.583
I'm a natural born producer.
I love showbiz, dude. I love showbiz.

19:28.709 --> 19:30.836
Uh, can I be in it?
Uh, you know, normally, Dee,

19:30.920 --> 19:32.504
I would take this
opportunity to insult you,

19:32.588 --> 19:35.006
but I'm gonna throw
an insane twist your way.

19:35.132 --> 19:37.968
You're gonna be the lead of the film.
I am? Really?

19:38.052 --> 19:40.136
No, you're not. Twisted again!
Boom! Try and keep up.

19:40.221 --> 19:43.139
Lot of twists. Lot of twists in
this thing, so try and keep up.

19:43.224 --> 19:45.517
There's so many twists,
I can't even follow it.

19:45.643 --> 19:47.561
It's tough to follow.
I'm gonna pull up the first scene...

19:47.645 --> 19:50.397
so you guys can get a taste of what
else is going on in this film.

19:50.523 --> 19:51.857
Yeah. Lay us on it.
It's really good.

19:51.983 --> 19:54.109
Uh- For some reason the phone
is frozen- Lay it on us.

19:54.193 --> 19:56.194
And I'm having a little trouble
pulling up the scene...

19:56.279 --> 19:59.030
And why is there grease
all over...

19:59.115 --> 20:02.033
Is this Frank's g-
goddamn sausage grease?

20:02.118 --> 20:04.870
Frank, you froze my phone
with your sausage greasy fingers!

20:04.954 --> 20:07.747
Frank, you son of a bitch!
