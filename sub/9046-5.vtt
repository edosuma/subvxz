00:00.100 --> 00:02.291
Previously on <i>Awkward...</i>

00:02.292 --> 00:03.493
You think I'm trying
to lure you away from Jake?

00:03.494 --> 00:04.627
Yes!

00:04.628 --> 00:05.995
Matty's
been acting weird lately.

00:05.996 --> 00:07.864
- Have you noticed?
- Truce. - Truce.

00:07.865 --> 00:11.901
I had faith that Matty and I
had potential to be friends.

00:18.842 --> 00:20.175
Love is a sham!

00:20.176 --> 00:22.277
Jealousy always had a way

00:22.278 --> 00:24.312
of bringing out the worst
in people.

00:24.313 --> 00:27.115
Amy!
I gave you my heart,

00:27.116 --> 00:31.219
my soul, my sweatshirt!

00:31.220 --> 00:32.686
I gave <i>her</i> that sweatshirt.

00:32.688 --> 00:35.623
- Bad breakup?
- 10.5 on the dick-ter scale.

00:35.624 --> 00:38.225
Tony caught Amy with Levi
at his sister's <i>quinceanera.</i>

00:38.226 --> 00:41.529
Ouch. Wasn't that party
over a month ago?

00:41.530 --> 00:43.398
Clearly, the fact
that it was Valentine's Day

00:43.399 --> 00:45.833
was giving Tony PTXD--

00:45.834 --> 00:47.702
Post traumatic ex disorder.

00:47.703 --> 00:49.235
I hate this holiday.

00:49.236 --> 00:51.772
V-day had divided the school
into lovers and haters,

00:51.773 --> 00:53.507
and I was a lover.

00:53.508 --> 00:57.076
'Cause for the first time,
my dad wasn't my only Valentine.

00:57.077 --> 00:59.312
I finally had no reason
to hate on hallmark

00:59.313 --> 01:01.281
because I had
a perfect boyfriend.

01:01.282 --> 01:03.149
There was nothing
to be jealous about.

01:03.150 --> 01:04.849
I was gonna enjoy the day...

01:04.851 --> 01:06.886
Love sucks!

01:06.887 --> 01:11.590
As a human target.

01:11.591 --> 01:15.060
Sync and corrections by n17t01
www.addic7ed.com

01:15.061 --> 01:16.395
Nice look.

01:16.396 --> 01:18.130
I was the victim
of a love-hate crime.

01:18.131 --> 01:20.765
The price you pay for PDA.

01:20.766 --> 01:24.068
Anyway, I need some advice.

01:24.069 --> 01:25.870
What makes the perfect date
for a Valentine?

01:25.871 --> 01:29.908
So Jake had sent Matty over
to get some covert intel.

01:29.909 --> 01:31.776
Well, someplace close is good.

01:31.777 --> 01:33.377
Keep it local.
Got it.

01:33.378 --> 01:35.079
And it's kind of a buzzkill
if you need a translator

01:35.080 --> 01:36.580
- to read the menu.
- And not too fancy.

01:36.581 --> 01:37.781
And very important--
The place should be quiet,

01:37.782 --> 01:38.949
so you can talk.

01:38.950 --> 01:40.317
I'd highly recommend Bisto's.

01:40.318 --> 01:42.285
- What about flowers?
- Flowers are great.

01:42.286 --> 01:44.054
But not carnations
or anything with baby's breath.

01:45.256 --> 01:47.691
- Does that smell like boobs?
- Gross.

01:47.692 --> 01:49.059
Personally, I prefer tulips.

01:49.060 --> 01:51.394
Hey, sorry I had
to kiss and run.

01:51.395 --> 01:54.564
I left something for you
in my car.

01:54.565 --> 01:56.031
What's up?

01:56.032 --> 01:57.733
Nothing.
I gotta go.

01:57.734 --> 01:59.301
- All right.
- Later.

01:59.302 --> 02:02.872
So here's the something
that I forgot.

02:02.873 --> 02:04.006
Oh!

02:04.007 --> 02:05.407
You didn't have to.

02:05.408 --> 02:07.276
- I've always loved...
- Love.

02:07.277 --> 02:09.544
- Beetles?
- It's a love bug.

02:09.544 --> 02:13.114
You know,
like a bug that brings...

02:13.115 --> 02:14.415
Never mind.

02:15.451 --> 02:17.151
So tonight...

02:17.152 --> 02:18.653
I was thinking, uh,
pick you up at about 7:00?

02:18.654 --> 02:20.870
Does that give you
enough time to get ready?

02:24.093 --> 02:26.293
- I'm sorry.
- What? Why?

02:26.294 --> 02:27.728
The bug.
It was an impulse buy.

02:27.729 --> 02:30.598
I promise, tonight,
everything will be better.

02:30.599 --> 02:32.466
It's adorable.
I love my bug.

02:34.536 --> 02:37.938
So Matty and that freshman--
Are they dating?

02:37.939 --> 02:39.339
Dating? No.

02:39.340 --> 02:41.841
He's about
to hook, line, and sink her.

02:41.842 --> 02:44.143
Right.
Dating is so not Matty.

02:44.144 --> 02:45.812
Which wasn't entirely true.

02:45.813 --> 02:47.013
We had gone on a date.

02:47.014 --> 02:48.681
Maybe he just didn't tell you?

02:48.682 --> 02:50.082
Nah. He'd tell me.

02:50.083 --> 02:52.018
Besides, Valentine's Day
is sappy,

02:52.019 --> 02:53.887
and that kid does not do sappy.

02:53.888 --> 02:56.588
I hate skanks.

02:56.589 --> 02:58.189
And sentimentality.

02:58.190 --> 03:01.793
Ugh, all this V-day crap
is making me nauseous.

03:01.794 --> 03:03.395
You're such a scrooge.

03:03.396 --> 03:05.797
Scrooge hated Christmas,
dip-hole.

03:05.798 --> 03:08.033
I don't know what
you're so amped up about.

03:08.034 --> 03:09.401
You're single.

03:09.402 --> 03:11.403
And you're mean.
And single.

03:11.404 --> 03:16.541
So tonight, I was thinking
we could kick off

03:16.542 --> 03:19.877
our carbs-only movie marathon
with a classic love story--

03:19.878 --> 03:22.112
In your honor--
Like <i>mean girls.</i>

03:22.113 --> 03:23.581
As pathetic as that sounds,

03:23.582 --> 03:25.282
I think
I'm just gonna stay home.

03:25.283 --> 03:26.851
But it's tradition.

03:26.852 --> 03:29.485
Maybe it's a heavy flow day.
I don't know.

03:29.486 --> 03:32.556
I'm just feeling
especially bitchy today.

03:32.557 --> 03:35.625
And how is that different
from every other day?

03:36.894 --> 03:38.728
He gave you a cockroach?

03:38.729 --> 03:40.430
It's a love bug.

03:40.431 --> 03:43.767
I swear, Valentine's is totally
racist against single people!

03:43.768 --> 03:47.269
It's just a toy that he
probably got at the car wash.

03:47.270 --> 03:49.638
Don't try
to climb into our love ghetto.

03:49.639 --> 03:51.006
You know Jake is gonna
plan something fantasmic

03:51.007 --> 03:52.441
for you tonight.

03:52.442 --> 03:53.809
He probably commissioned
a portrait of you guys

03:53.810 --> 03:55.044
made entirely out of skittles.

03:55.045 --> 03:56.645
Who wants
to eat their own face?

03:56.646 --> 03:58.213
Uh, I do.

03:58.214 --> 03:59.982
But instead I'll be planted
in front of my DVR

03:59.983 --> 04:01.583
doing shots of cyanide
with you.

04:01.584 --> 04:03.985
Not this year.

04:03.986 --> 04:05.720
I'm going to the BHP.

04:05.721 --> 04:06.821
The black hearts party?

04:06.822 --> 04:08.255
What is that?

04:08.256 --> 04:09.924
Only <i>the</i> event
for the single and bitter!

04:09.925 --> 04:11.993
What time are we rolling in?
It shouldn't be too early,

04:11.994 --> 04:13.494
yet it shouldn't be too late
because it's a school night.

04:13.495 --> 04:15.162
T, you might want
to skip this one.

04:15.163 --> 04:16.697
Why? Who's more single
and bitter than me?

04:16.697 --> 04:18.031
Well, besides Tony.

04:18.031 --> 04:20.033
Trust me, you don't want to go.

04:20.034 --> 04:22.469
- Trust me, I do.
- You can't!

04:22.470 --> 04:25.939
Ricky's going to be there.

04:25.940 --> 04:27.273
And he's in love.

04:27.274 --> 04:29.109
I call shenanigans.

04:29.110 --> 04:30.611
People are talking.

04:30.612 --> 04:33.413
Let me tell you something
about Ricky Schwartz.

04:33.414 --> 04:34.847
The only time
he uses the "L" word

04:34.848 --> 04:36.216
is for burritos
and lesbian porn.

04:36.217 --> 04:38.351
Besides, if he fell in love
that fast,

04:38.352 --> 04:40.019
then I meant nothing to him,

04:40.020 --> 04:41.588
and that is not possible.
Jenna, confirm.

04:41.589 --> 04:43.055
This is what exes do.

04:43.056 --> 04:44.690
They make up rumors
to get into your head,

04:44.691 --> 04:47.327
to screw with you.
I'm right, right?

04:47.328 --> 04:48.461
Right.

04:48.462 --> 04:49.662
About Ricky.

04:49.663 --> 04:51.597
But that rule doesn't apply
to all exes.

04:51.598 --> 04:55.601
Matty and I don't play
head games.

04:55.602 --> 04:57.103
Or did we?

04:57.104 --> 05:01.573
Have you guys seen that girl
Matty's been hanging out with?

05:01.574 --> 05:02.975
- Yes.
- Yes.

05:02.976 --> 05:05.611
Do you think she's attractive?

05:05.612 --> 05:08.347
- Yes.
- Yes.

05:10.716 --> 05:13.118
I guess,
if you're into a lot of makeup.

05:13.119 --> 05:15.154
What?
I'm just curious

05:15.155 --> 05:17.122
as to what she's hiding
under all that.

05:17.123 --> 05:19.090
Nobody likes
a green-eyed monster.

05:19.091 --> 05:20.592
I'm not jealous.

05:20.593 --> 05:22.693
My friends are allowed
to make new friends.

05:22.694 --> 05:24.762
It's just that this new friend
doesn't really meet

05:24.763 --> 05:26.464
my old friend's standards.

05:26.465 --> 05:28.599
So the new friend is super rad?

05:28.600 --> 05:29.634
No.

05:29.635 --> 05:31.435
Then why do you seem
so jealous?

05:31.436 --> 05:32.870
Just because
someone seems jealous

05:32.871 --> 05:34.338
doesn't mean they are.

05:34.339 --> 05:38.941
Actually, it probably does.

05:38.942 --> 05:40.510
And I get it.

05:40.511 --> 05:42.812
It is not fun to feel replaced.

05:42.813 --> 05:45.982
Ironically, Val had become
a lot more insightful

05:45.983 --> 05:47.150
since she left
the guidance office.

05:47.151 --> 05:48.418
Don't feel threatened.

05:48.419 --> 05:50.019
Your mom and I
were just being buds

05:50.020 --> 05:51.354
when we went out for
a girls night last week.

05:51.355 --> 05:52.955
You hung out with my mom?

05:52.956 --> 05:54.290
Really, Jenna,

05:54.291 --> 05:56.758
it was just dinner
between two friends.

05:56.759 --> 06:00.829
But the feelings you're having
are normal.

06:00.830 --> 06:02.931
Don't you worry.

06:02.932 --> 06:04.633
I will never put you
in the backseat.

06:04.634 --> 06:06.835
As far as I'm concerned,
you got permanent shotgun.

06:06.836 --> 06:08.604
Great.

06:08.605 --> 06:10.705
One more thing.

06:13.409 --> 06:14.642
Sorry.

06:14.643 --> 06:16.211
That's not for you.

06:16.212 --> 06:18.213
Saving that for Alok.

06:18.214 --> 06:19.581
Lost a little bit of the "K."

06:19.582 --> 06:20.915
But we french kiss,
so he won't mind.

06:20.916 --> 06:23.918
This one is for you.

06:23.919 --> 06:25.386
You'll always be

06:25.387 --> 06:29.989
my BFF--

06:29.990 --> 06:31.925
Stands forever.

06:34.429 --> 06:37.931
So I made the usual
reservation at the Red Onion

06:37.932 --> 06:39.733
for our Valentine's dinner.

06:39.734 --> 06:41.835
Hate to break it to you,
but I have a real date tonight.

06:41.836 --> 06:43.536
Oh, actually it doesn't look

06:43.537 --> 06:45.037
like you hated breaking that
to me at all.

06:45.038 --> 06:47.240
Bet mom's not doing anything
tonight.

06:47.241 --> 06:50.309
Take her out and finally have
a Valentine's dinner

06:50.310 --> 06:52.911
without your annoying kid
tagging along.

06:52.912 --> 06:54.580
Not this year, kiddo.

07:00.753 --> 07:02.186
What a surprise!

07:02.187 --> 07:04.222
I didn't know
you were picking Jenna up today.

07:04.223 --> 07:06.324
It's a little hard
to keep track of everything

07:06.325 --> 07:08.727
with so much on my plate.

07:08.728 --> 07:10.362
Like what?

07:10.363 --> 07:15.132
Like all of my events
with all of my new friends.

07:15.133 --> 07:16.767
The old friend bit.

07:16.768 --> 07:17.968
She was posturing.

07:17.969 --> 07:19.303
How about you?

07:19.304 --> 07:20.771
Nope.
Not much to tell.

07:20.772 --> 07:24.742
Except that
our daughter's home safe...

07:24.743 --> 07:27.778
And I'm gonna go.

07:27.779 --> 07:29.079
Happy Valentine's Day, Lace.

07:29.080 --> 07:31.113
You too!

07:34.951 --> 07:37.287
Lots to do?
Like what?

07:37.288 --> 07:38.888
Hang out with
my old guidance counselor?

07:38.889 --> 07:40.456
You know what?

07:40.457 --> 07:42.191
I bet there's a good
Lifetime marathon on tonight.

07:42.192 --> 07:43.826
So why don't you watch that

07:43.827 --> 07:46.561
and give me the play-by-play
when I get home from my date?

07:46.562 --> 07:51.266
Or you can catch the end with
me when you're home by 10:00.

07:57.206 --> 07:59.140
I'm sorry I didn't open
the door for you.

07:59.141 --> 08:00.742
This whole curfew thing

08:00.743 --> 08:04.077
is really throwing off
my timetable for the night.

08:04.078 --> 08:06.781
I just really want everything
to be perfect.

08:06.782 --> 08:08.048
And it already is.

08:08.049 --> 08:09.950
Starting with
the great restaurant.

08:09.951 --> 08:11.652
Thanks to my suggestion.

08:11.653 --> 08:13.987
Thought you'd like it.

08:13.988 --> 08:17.625
Good food, not too noisy,
so we can, uh--

08:17.626 --> 08:19.793
- Talk?
- Exactly.

08:19.794 --> 08:22.261
- Rosati for two.
- Yeah.

08:22.262 --> 08:24.664
I've got the perfect table.

08:32.340 --> 08:33.539
The maitre D' was wrong.

08:33.541 --> 08:34.905
And so was Jake.

08:34.907 --> 08:36.808
Not only was Matty dating,

08:36.809 --> 08:38.210
he was on <i>my</i> date.

08:40.111 --> 08:42.111
Wow! This is a...

08:42.113 --> 08:44.347
- A coincidence.
- Or a total setup.

08:44.348 --> 08:45.815
I could smell a rat.

08:45.816 --> 08:48.350
Or was it the scent
of a cheap, freshman Barbie?

08:48.351 --> 08:49.451
Is there a problem?

08:49.452 --> 08:52.954
I requested a window table.

08:52.955 --> 08:55.491
Unfortunately,
we are booked solid.

08:55.492 --> 08:57.792
I guess we're sitting.

08:59.000 --> 09:05.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

09:10.105 --> 09:13.574
Hey, you guys haven't met.
Courtney. Jake.

09:13.575 --> 09:16.444
- Hi. - Hi.
- And this is...

09:16.445 --> 09:18.079
The girl he deflowered
at summer camp.

09:18.080 --> 09:19.113
Jenna.

09:19.114 --> 09:22.082
Nice to meet you guys.

09:22.083 --> 09:24.984
Matty, this place
is so romantic.

09:33.994 --> 09:35.429
Ooh.

09:35.430 --> 09:38.330
Good thing your ass is small.
You almost stained my skirt.

09:38.331 --> 09:39.565
Yeah, good thing.

09:39.566 --> 09:41.133
And good thing
I dumped her date,

09:41.134 --> 09:43.936
or her ass would have been
firmly planted on her couch.

09:43.937 --> 09:46.439
- Alone.
- I'm really sorry.

09:46.440 --> 09:48.274
I was hoping for something
a little more private.

09:48.275 --> 09:49.508
It's fine.

09:49.509 --> 09:51.410
Because <i>we</i> were mature.

09:51.411 --> 09:52.810
Well, most of us.

09:52.811 --> 09:53.844
I can talk to the host again.

09:53.845 --> 09:55.713
Let's just focus on us.

09:55.714 --> 09:58.916
We won't even know
they're here.

09:58.917 --> 10:03.788
Are you gonna use
that extra napkin?

10:03.789 --> 10:05.690
- Thanks.
- Mm.

10:12.130 --> 10:13.430
Tell me this.

10:13.431 --> 10:14.831
If Ricky's so in love,

10:14.832 --> 10:16.666
why is he at a singles party?

10:16.667 --> 10:17.934
The mafia is never wrong.

10:17.935 --> 10:20.003
Quick,
act cross-faded.

10:22.474 --> 10:26.008
Hey, Ming.
Tamara. 'Sup?

10:27.544 --> 10:28.944
Did you see that?

10:28.945 --> 10:30.913
He just breezed on by
like I was invisible.

10:30.914 --> 10:33.749
No, he saw you.
He said your name.

10:33.750 --> 10:37.052
Exactly. My name,
not "beautiful" or "babe."

10:37.053 --> 10:39.422
He is absolutely fucking
with me, but the joke is on him

10:39.423 --> 10:40.622
because I don't care.

10:40.623 --> 10:43.492
Now help me find someone
to dry hump.

10:52.401 --> 10:54.702
Are you sure you don't want
to send it back?

10:54.703 --> 10:56.403
I can just eat around them.

10:56.404 --> 10:57.538
Oh, not a good idea.

10:57.539 --> 11:00.407
Here, give them to me.
Yeah.

11:00.408 --> 11:02.576
Oh, little chicken there.

11:07.149 --> 11:08.582
She's allergic.

11:08.583 --> 11:10.451
You're allergic?

11:10.452 --> 11:12.452
A little.

11:12.453 --> 11:13.453
I've mentioned it before.

11:13.454 --> 11:15.688
Yeah, she has.

11:15.689 --> 11:19.325
Otherwise, how would I know?

11:19.326 --> 11:21.194
You gotta try this.

11:28.902 --> 11:31.537
Mmm.

11:31.538 --> 11:32.972
Look, let me get you
something else.

11:32.973 --> 11:34.840
- Waiter?
- No, no, no.

11:34.841 --> 11:36.108
I'm fine with breadsticks.

11:36.109 --> 11:38.978
See?
Ahh.

11:41.748 --> 11:43.949
Oh, uh, you know what?
I'll take one.

11:43.950 --> 11:45.750
Jake, no, no, no, don't worry,
I don't want one.

11:45.751 --> 11:47.952
- I want to.
- It's such a waste.

11:47.953 --> 11:50.855
<i>Una rosa, por favor.</i>

11:50.856 --> 11:52.924
Actually,
they are really pretty.

11:52.925 --> 11:54.492
First tulips and now this?

11:54.493 --> 11:55.493
Do you want me
to chase her down?

11:55.494 --> 11:57.228
I can do that.

11:57.229 --> 11:58.663
Bizatch.

11:58.664 --> 12:00.131
Not only had she crashed
my perfect date,

12:00.132 --> 12:01.965
but she'd also snaked
my perfect flowers,

12:01.966 --> 12:05.135
which I suddenly realized were
glaringly absent from my night.

12:05.136 --> 12:06.704
Yeah, the ziti's pretty good,

12:06.705 --> 12:08.538
but I gotta be honest,
not as good as mine.

12:08.539 --> 12:10.941
You cook?

12:10.942 --> 12:13.243
- That's hilarious.
- Excuse me?

12:13.244 --> 12:15.846
You can't even cook
a pop-tart, bro.

12:15.847 --> 12:17.180
Uh, who made that amazing
french toast last weekend?

12:17.181 --> 12:19.148
- Your mom.
- After I set her up.

12:19.149 --> 12:21.483
That's ridiculous.

12:22.920 --> 12:24.553
- Have you ever used a whisk?
- Isn't he cute?

12:24.554 --> 12:26.989
I can't believe I'm on a date
with Matty McKibben!

12:26.990 --> 12:28.557
Either way,
it doesn't matter--

12:28.558 --> 12:29.892
And neither could I.

12:29.893 --> 12:31.961
Normally,
eyeliner's really fem,

12:31.962 --> 12:34.996
but yours makes me feel
emo-sexual.

12:34.997 --> 12:37.599
Whatever, Twilight.

12:37.600 --> 12:39.634
Choose a gender.

12:39.635 --> 12:41.469
Can you believe that guy?

12:41.470 --> 12:43.271
Holy photo op.

12:43.272 --> 12:46.374
I just realized this
is your first red cup!

12:46.375 --> 12:47.675
Or black cup.
Whatever.

12:47.676 --> 12:49.343
We need to tweet this asap.

12:49.344 --> 12:52.213
Hey, can you pixelize us?

12:52.214 --> 12:53.447
All right.

12:53.448 --> 12:55.149
Say, "love sucks."

12:55.150 --> 12:57.584
- Love sucks.
- Love sucks.

12:57.585 --> 12:58.886
Ricky Schwartz at 10:00.

12:58.887 --> 13:01.789
I need some lips to smack stat.

13:01.790 --> 13:03.190
She's always like that.

13:03.191 --> 13:06.192
I've suggested
electroconvulsive therapy but...

13:06.193 --> 13:07.693
I'll just take that back now.

13:07.694 --> 13:09.662
No, the spaz is right.

13:09.663 --> 13:11.931
This moment needs
to be immortalized.

13:11.932 --> 13:14.400
I'm Fred Wu, by the way.

13:14.401 --> 13:15.635
Ming.

13:15.636 --> 13:17.637
Well, Ming-just-Ming...

13:17.638 --> 13:20.039
Smile.

13:24.410 --> 13:25.710
- Butta teeth.
- Butta teeth?

13:25.711 --> 13:28.247
Everything looked good
but the teeth.

13:28.248 --> 13:30.515
I am totally shooting
in the dark here.

13:30.516 --> 13:32.651
Where are the damn lights?

13:35.554 --> 13:39.023
Nobody move.

13:42.861 --> 13:46.498
Anish Bhatia by the door.
Easy target.

13:46.499 --> 13:47.799
No, they had no defense, Jake!

13:47.800 --> 13:49.734
But offense is what gets you
in the playoffs.

13:49.735 --> 13:51.068
- Okay, come here.
- It's-- okay.

13:51.069 --> 13:53.104
See...
This is your offense.

13:53.105 --> 13:55.506
Nothing, little--
They're n-nothing.

13:55.507 --> 13:58.609
That doesn't
even make any--

13:58.610 --> 14:00.811
Hey, I'm sorry.

14:00.812 --> 14:02.245
Going on about some stupid game

14:02.246 --> 14:03.980
when I have the real prize
right here.

14:03.981 --> 14:06.249
It was sweet.
We were sweet.

14:06.250 --> 14:08.919
And suddenly, it didn't matter
that my night had been hijacked.

14:08.920 --> 14:11.086
I had Jake, who would hold
my hand in public.

14:11.087 --> 14:14.056
Courtney was never gonna
get that from Matty.

14:17.227 --> 14:20.196
Okay, so maybe not never.

14:20.197 --> 14:22.031
Oh!
Oh.

14:22.032 --> 14:22.898
Oh.

14:22.899 --> 14:26.167
But he was still hiding her.

14:26.168 --> 14:27.536
Right out in the open.

14:28.939 --> 14:30.072
Matty wasn't hiding
his feelings.

14:30.073 --> 14:31.273
Waiter, we need some ice.

14:31.274 --> 14:32.208
He was flaunting them,

14:32.209 --> 14:33.842
and I was totally jealous.

14:33.843 --> 14:35.211
Aw, it's already starting
to swell.

14:35.212 --> 14:37.846
Yeah, that sounded
like that really hurt.

14:37.847 --> 14:40.449
It's fine,
just give me a minute.

14:40.450 --> 14:42.485
Well, I'm gonna get some ice.

14:42.486 --> 14:44.052
T, you were so right.

14:44.053 --> 14:47.122
I'm no more evolved with Matty
than you are with Ricky.

14:47.123 --> 14:49.991
He's here on my date
with his own date,

14:49.992 --> 14:52.760
and I just don't know
what to say.

14:52.761 --> 14:57.198
I put some ice in a napkin.

14:57.199 --> 14:58.733
Sorry if there's
some Diet Coke on it.

14:58.734 --> 15:02.402
- Thanks.
- No, no, thank you...

15:02.403 --> 15:03.937
For all the pointers.

15:03.938 --> 15:07.007
Courtney seems like
she's having a good time, right?

15:07.008 --> 15:09.109
Suddenly, it all made sense.

15:09.110 --> 15:12.412
The restaurant, the tulips,
the public display

15:12.413 --> 15:13.614
of digital connection.

15:13.615 --> 15:15.382
Matty was trying
to make me jealous.

15:15.383 --> 15:17.783
I just, um--

15:17.784 --> 15:19.418
I just didn't want
to screw things up with her

15:19.419 --> 15:23.589
like I did with you.

15:23.590 --> 15:26.492
Hey, you okay?

15:26.493 --> 15:28.394
Only time would tell.

15:29.596 --> 15:31.930
What am I doing?

15:31.931 --> 15:33.898
I have spent my whole night
trying to out-douche a douche

15:33.899 --> 15:35.700
who isn't even here anymore.

15:35.701 --> 15:38.836
Jealousy is not
a good color on me.

15:40.706 --> 15:42.274
And neither is red on you.

15:42.275 --> 15:43.975
Red?

15:43.976 --> 15:46.711
You've got full-on beer blush
happening.

15:48.814 --> 15:50.181
Wait.

15:50.182 --> 15:52.783
What else is happening?

15:52.784 --> 15:54.084
Am I fucking-blocking?

15:54.085 --> 15:55.085
- Yes.
- Yes.

15:55.086 --> 15:56.287
Well, wrap it up.

15:56.288 --> 15:59.890
I gotta pee,
and then we're outty 5,000.

15:59.891 --> 16:02.759
Oh, gotta pee.
Excuse me, sorry.

16:02.760 --> 16:05.895
Really gotta pee
okay, excuse me.

16:08.499 --> 16:10.166
Look, I get that
what's going on in there

16:10.167 --> 16:12.034
doesn't involve the kind
of bodily functions

16:12.035 --> 16:13.169
we all need to perform,

16:13.170 --> 16:16.939
but that's what cars
are made for.

16:16.940 --> 16:20.343
Seriously, I drank two bitter
pills and three bloody cupids,

16:20.344 --> 16:23.812
and I need to pee!

16:23.813 --> 16:26.448
Ricky?

16:31.787 --> 16:33.655
Ming!
Car, now!

16:40.429 --> 16:43.097
- It was fun.
- Be honest.

16:43.098 --> 16:44.732
On a scale of one to ten,

16:44.733 --> 16:47.301
I figure I'm batting
about a negative 60 right now?

16:47.302 --> 16:50.504
Stop it.

16:53.474 --> 16:55.342
It's for me.

16:55.343 --> 16:56.843
From my dad.

16:58.412 --> 16:59.979
Guy's got crap taste.

17:06.119 --> 17:08.288
Tonight was amazing.

17:08.289 --> 17:09.921
And these flowers--

17:09.922 --> 17:10.955
What are they?

17:10.957 --> 17:13.259
Calla lilies.

17:13.260 --> 17:17.061
Strong but beautiful.

17:17.063 --> 17:20.531
They reminded me of you.

17:20.532 --> 17:22.268
So much better than tulips.

17:22.269 --> 17:24.502
Tulips?

17:24.503 --> 17:26.337
Tulips.

17:26.338 --> 17:27.638
Should I have gotten you
tulips?

17:27.640 --> 17:29.807
How many more ways
can I screw up this day?

17:29.808 --> 17:32.109
The real question was,
how many ways could I?

17:32.110 --> 17:33.978
I almost let my jealousy
ruin the night

17:33.979 --> 17:37.382
'cause Jake never asked Matty to
get intel about what I wanted.

17:37.383 --> 17:40.017
He didn't have to.
He just knew.

17:40.018 --> 17:41.985
- You didn't screw up anything.
- No, I did.

17:41.986 --> 17:43.387
I've been a nervous wreck
all day

17:43.388 --> 17:44.888
and botching everything
because...

17:44.889 --> 17:47.424
- This was the best date ever.
- I love you, Jenna.

17:47.425 --> 17:50.093
What?

17:50.094 --> 17:51.461
I love you.

18:04.874 --> 18:08.010
Awesome.

18:08.011 --> 18:09.912
Yeah.

18:09.913 --> 18:12.448
Um...

18:12.449 --> 18:14.849
Happy Valentine's Day.

18:21.343 --> 18:23.644
You're late.

18:23.645 --> 18:26.279
And don't even bother showing me
what he gave you.

18:26.280 --> 18:27.814
I don't want to see it.

18:27.815 --> 18:29.649
I could have
and maybe should have

18:29.650 --> 18:31.151
rubbed my V-day booty

18:31.152 --> 18:33.720
in my mother's face,
but I wasn't heartless.

18:33.721 --> 18:36.523
Actually, this was
at the door for you.

18:36.524 --> 18:38.392
It's from dad.

18:38.393 --> 18:39.559
Really?

18:39.560 --> 18:41.460
Good night, mom.

18:46.066 --> 18:47.133
What is it?

18:47.134 --> 18:50.536
A beetle.

18:50.537 --> 18:52.438
Love.

19:01.280 --> 19:02.547
- Jenna.
- T, what are you--

19:02.548 --> 19:05.683
Ricky's in love...
with Sadie.

19:05.684 --> 19:07.352
Am I really so hideous that

19:07.353 --> 19:09.954
- he'd choose Darth Hater over me?
- What?

19:09.955 --> 19:11.156
Screw Ricky Schwartz.

19:11.157 --> 19:12.256
But Ricky is--

19:12.257 --> 19:13.557
No buts.
You're amazing.

19:13.558 --> 19:15.292
If he wants to be with Sadie,
let him.

19:15.293 --> 19:16.826
They deserve each other.

19:16.827 --> 19:19.029
It's just really hard
when someone you care about

19:19.030 --> 19:21.065
moves on before you do.

19:21.066 --> 19:22.266
It was.

19:22.267 --> 19:23.600
I had moved on with Jake,

19:23.601 --> 19:25.569
so why shouldn't Matty
move on too?

19:25.570 --> 19:27.337
What if nobody ever loves me?

19:27.338 --> 19:29.439
Hey, I love you.

19:29.440 --> 19:33.242
Yeah, but nobody good loves me.

19:35.312 --> 19:38.514
T, why are you wearing
my pants?

19:38.515 --> 19:41.284
I peed in mine.
