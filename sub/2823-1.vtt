03:27.374 --> 03:29.625
A shrimp's heart is in its head.

03:29.626 --> 03:32.044
This is fucking tripping me out.

03:32.045 --> 03:34.463
Really, Cheech?
10:00 a.m.?

03:34.464 --> 03:35.506
Yeah.
Oh, sorry.

03:35.507 --> 03:36.882
You getting a contact high?

03:36.883 --> 03:41.721
You gonna be all seizuring out on me?
I don't get seizures.

03:41.722 --> 03:44.390
Mm-hmm.
What do you call them again?

03:44.391 --> 03:47.351
They're marijuana-induced fits.
It's a medical condition.

03:48.395 --> 03:49.562
What are you doing tonight?

03:49.563 --> 03:51.313
I don't know. I got to go.
Call me later.

03:51.314 --> 03:52.848
Okay.

04:09.791 --> 04:11.125
Hello?

04:11.126 --> 04:13.586
So, uh, what are you
doing tonight?

04:13.587 --> 04:15.171
I don't know.

04:15.172 --> 04:16.589
That's why I said,
"Call me later."

04:16.589 --> 04:19.033
I know. I am.

04:20.135 --> 04:22.762
So Ash and I are going to this
Alvin Ailey modern-dance thing.

04:22.763 --> 04:24.346
Looks kind of cool.
You want to join?

04:24.347 --> 04:25.710
Modern dance?

04:26.475 --> 04:29.518
Not exactly what I had in mind
for tonight--or ever, really.

04:29.519 --> 04:30.561
All right.

04:30.562 --> 04:32.772
Let's definitely grab
a beer before I go.

04:32.773 --> 04:34.064
Yeah, I don't know, man.

04:34.065 --> 04:36.442
I think I'm just gonna heat
up some Chinese food.

04:36.443 --> 04:38.027
You mean play video games.
All right.

04:38.028 --> 04:39.945
Why change your routine
at this point, huh?

04:39.946 --> 04:41.447
I got to go. Bye.

04:43.450 --> 04:45.939
There you go.
Thank you.

04:47.370 --> 04:48.621
Hey.
What can I get for you?

04:48.622 --> 04:51.582
I'll just take a medium
coffee to go.

04:51.583 --> 04:53.071
Thanks.

04:55.670 --> 05:00.132
Such a-- Such a beautiful day
out, and it, uh, doesn't--

05:00.133 --> 05:02.372
doesn't feel like
November at all.

05:04.513 --> 05:08.015
Feels like--like maybe
early s-- early summer.

05:08.016 --> 05:09.141
June.

05:09.142 --> 05:12.269
Here you go.
Thank you.

05:12.270 --> 05:15.514
Thanks.
Done and done.

05:19.486 --> 05:21.904
La-te-"L"-apostrophe-ticia?

05:21.905 --> 05:23.973
L'ticia?

05:25.325 --> 05:26.325
Okay.

05:26.326 --> 05:29.036
Thanks so much.
Thank you.

05:29.037 --> 05:30.079
Mr. Newman, hello.
Hello.

05:30.080 --> 05:31.121
It's quite an honor.

05:31.122 --> 05:32.373
My name is David Abbott.

05:32.374 --> 05:34.834
I have read all three of your books.
Oh, thank you, David.

05:34.835 --> 05:36.669
You can just call me Sam.

05:36.670 --> 05:38.003
Sam.

05:38.004 --> 05:39.630
Can you make it out
to "Sticky Fingers"?

05:39.631 --> 05:41.382
That is my avatar name.

05:41.383 --> 05:42.716
Sticky Fingers?

05:42.717 --> 05:43.759
Yes, sir.

05:43.760 --> 05:44.802
Okay.

05:44.803 --> 05:46.679
Question for you.

05:46.680 --> 05:50.250
What inspired your decision to
kill off Tabitha at the end?

05:51.685 --> 05:52.685
Well--

05:52.686 --> 05:54.478
Was it because she had broken
the sacred oath

05:54.479 --> 05:55.479
of the Baldroozen nymphs?

05:55.480 --> 05:58.065
I mean, I guess she
had it coming.

05:58.066 --> 06:00.526
Uh, actually, Sticky,

06:00.527 --> 06:03.529
I was-I was sort of inspired
by the movie studio

06:03.530 --> 06:06.065
that commissioned me
to write it, honestly.

06:07.534 --> 06:12.413
You see, the movie was already
made, so they just paid me to

06:12.414 --> 06:16.917
write exactly what
happened in the m-movie.

06:16.918 --> 06:18.406
You know, that-- that's what I do.

06:19.963 --> 06:21.155
Sorry.

06:29.472 --> 06:33.392
Surprise!
Oh. my God!

06:33.393 --> 06:35.394
Sarah!
Hi.

06:35.395 --> 06:38.063
Jesus.
Sarah Anderson.

06:38.064 --> 06:39.231
Holy shit.

06:39.232 --> 06:42.401
Oh, no, actually,
it's Sarah Schipper now.

06:42.402 --> 06:43.777
Wow.

06:43.778 --> 06:44.820
Crazy.

06:44.821 --> 06:46.906
What are you--
Congratulations.

06:46.907 --> 06:48.908
Thank you.
That's ba--that's a rock.

06:48.909 --> 06:51.035
Well--I don't--

06:51.036 --> 06:52.494
What are you-- what
are you doing here?

06:52.495 --> 06:53.746
Well, my husband works
around the corner.

06:53.747 --> 06:55.247
I was walking by,
and I saw your name,

06:55.248 --> 06:57.750
and I thought,
"I should just pop in."

06:57.751 --> 06:59.251
Yeah.
Well, I'm glad--

06:59.252 --> 07:01.962
I'm sorry.
I'm glad you did.

07:01.963 --> 07:03.505
Hi.
Oh.

07:03.506 --> 07:05.507
Wait.
What?

07:05.508 --> 07:07.927
Yep, that happened.
You got a--

07:07.928 --> 07:09.929
A baby.
You got a baby.

07:09.930 --> 07:11.430
Yeah.

07:11.431 --> 07:13.098
Wow. Wow.

07:13.099 --> 07:15.851
What about you?
You got a wife or kids, family?

07:15.852 --> 07:16.936
Nope.
No?

07:16.937 --> 07:19.939
None--none of the above.
Not even a girlfriend?

07:19.940 --> 07:23.734
Eh.
Aw.

07:23.735 --> 07:25.694
Congratulations on the
whole writing thing.

07:25.695 --> 07:26.820
It's great.

07:26.821 --> 07:27.988
Yeah. Yeah.

07:27.989 --> 07:29.156
Not--not bad.

07:29.157 --> 07:30.199
Not bad.

07:30.200 --> 07:31.325
So where does your husband work?

07:31.326 --> 07:33.452
You said he works around the--
Oh, he's at the Puma store.

07:33.453 --> 07:37.206
Oh, no, he's a-- he's a
columnist at the Times.

07:37.207 --> 07:38.207
The New York Times?

07:38.208 --> 07:39.500
Yeah.

07:39.501 --> 07:40.709
Whoa.

07:40.710 --> 07:42.369
Yeah.
Cool.

07:43.546 --> 07:45.005
Well, I'd love to get
a copy of the book.

07:45.006 --> 07:46.924
Oh. Really?

07:46.925 --> 07:48.133
Yeah. Sure.

07:48.134 --> 07:49.843
Okay.
Uh...

07:49.844 --> 07:51.637
Want to sign it for me?
Oh, sure.

07:51.638 --> 07:53.806
It just seems so weird.

07:53.807 --> 07:54.974
Let's see.

07:54.975 --> 07:56.668
Uh, okay.

08:00.313 --> 08:01.847
All right.
Yeah.

08:03.233 --> 08:05.651
How are your parents?

08:05.652 --> 08:07.945
Oh, uh, yeah-huh.

08:07.946 --> 08:10.030
Yeah, they got a--
they got a divorce.

08:10.031 --> 08:11.532
What?

08:11.533 --> 08:12.825
After I left for college, yeah.

08:12.826 --> 08:13.909
My mom, uh--

08:13.910 --> 08:16.570
They always seemed like they had
the most perfect relationship.

08:17.872 --> 08:19.690
Well...

08:21.126 --> 08:23.127
Hey, guess where Joel and I
are spending the summer.

08:23.128 --> 08:25.045
Y-y-Yosemite.

08:25.046 --> 08:26.380
Espoo.

08:26.381 --> 08:27.664
Where?

08:28.967 --> 08:30.342
Espoo.

08:30.343 --> 08:32.010
Where my whole family's from.

08:32.011 --> 08:33.303
Are you kidding?

08:33.304 --> 08:35.431
Oh, yeah.

08:35.432 --> 08:36.472
Yeah.

08:36.474 --> 08:39.268
No, I remember.
In, uh, N-Norway.

08:39.269 --> 08:40.712
Finland.
Finland.

08:41.104 --> 08:42.145
Near Norway.

08:42.147 --> 08:45.149
We talked about getting
married there, but, well...

08:45.150 --> 08:47.890
It's nice to see that you
haven't changed at all, Sam.

08:52.741 --> 08:54.158
Take care, Sam.

08:54.159 --> 08:55.784
You too.

08:55.785 --> 08:56.994
Dude, she's pregnant!

08:56.995 --> 08:57.995
That sucks.

08:57.996 --> 08:59.705
Yeah, I'm sitting there
signing autographs

08:59.706 --> 09:02.249
like a jackass, this stupid book.

09:02.250 --> 09:03.500
It was so humiliating.

09:03.501 --> 09:05.169
Sorry, Mr. Newman.
Yeah.

09:05.170 --> 09:06.628
My manager told me I
have to take the order now.

09:06.629 --> 09:09.089
You want to have the special?

09:09.090 --> 09:10.340
Uh, no, just the usual.

09:10.341 --> 09:11.341
Thanks, Howard.

09:11.342 --> 09:12.342
Um...

09:12.343 --> 09:16.305
So she looks at me like I was
the saddest, most pathet--

09:16.306 --> 09:18.057
Sorry I don't work
for The New York Times.

09:18.058 --> 09:19.558
The New York Times is not
really what it used to be.

09:19.559 --> 09:20.601
I got to go.

09:20.602 --> 09:22.144
Oh, Wait. Uh--

09:22.145 --> 09:23.896
I have a lot of customer
to take care of.

09:23.897 --> 09:26.136
Well, I'll talk to you s--
Bye.

09:26.775 --> 09:28.058
Okay.

09:32.447 --> 09:34.436
Oh, my God, I got to
write something good.

09:41.956 --> 09:44.666
There you go.
What's that for?

09:44.667 --> 09:48.796
Oh. I thought-- Aren't
you-- Homeless?

09:48.797 --> 09:50.089
Sorry.
I just thought that was a--

09:50.090 --> 09:51.090
That's a chai.

09:52.092 --> 09:56.095
I'm so sorry. Uh...
Hey, what's up?

09:56.096 --> 09:57.880
Yeah.
No, I saw the Instagram.

10:11.611 --> 10:12.820
Hey, Alan.

10:12.821 --> 10:14.863
Hey.
How'd the signing go, guy?

10:14.864 --> 10:16.490
Um, fine.

10:16.491 --> 10:18.617
Yeah, all right.
Total domination, right?

10:18.618 --> 10:22.162
Teen Vampire continues
to command the shelves.

10:22.163 --> 10:24.456
Well, quantity over quality.

10:24.457 --> 10:25.791
That's what I say.

10:25.792 --> 10:27.042
All right, listen,
the studio would like you

10:27.043 --> 10:28.877
to translate a couple more
of their films into books.

10:28.878 --> 10:30.295
Yeah, I don't know, man.
I-I--

10:30.296 --> 10:32.131
The first one here
actually smells pretty good.

10:32.132 --> 10:34.967
Let me set the table for you.
It's an action-adventure flick,

10:34.968 --> 10:37.219
and it's called
"doomtombalienwomb"--

10:37.220 --> 10:38.887
it's one word--
"dot-net," I think.

10:38.888 --> 10:39.972
Check it out.

10:39.973 --> 10:42.224
It's sizzling, and they got apps, and
they got the whole thing happening.

10:42.225 --> 10:43.308
Okay, yeah.

10:43.309 --> 10:45.310
Um... All right, let me move on.

10:45.311 --> 10:47.396
I got a romantic comedy for you
too, and this one's called Sherpa.

10:47.397 --> 10:49.523
Sherpa?
I think you could kill this shit.

10:49.524 --> 10:51.400
Like the--like the Nepal--

10:51.401 --> 10:52.484
Yeah, a woman
who climbs Everest.

10:52.485 --> 10:53.485
Okay.

10:53.486 --> 10:56.697
But in the process, she finds the
biggest discovery of her life:

10:56.698 --> 10:58.740
love with her Sherpa guide.

10:58.741 --> 10:59.783
She falls in love with him.

10:59.784 --> 11:00.826
They're from different
backgrounds.

11:00.827 --> 11:03.120
They speak the language of
kindness or something like that.

11:03.121 --> 11:04.830
Listen, Alan, I don't know.

11:04.831 --> 11:07.166
Lookit, I'm not saying that this
stuff is actually hard-on-inducing,

11:07.167 --> 11:08.917
but you pop off a couple
more of these bad boys--

11:08.918 --> 11:10.836
Alan, I think I'm gonna start
writing something else.

11:10.837 --> 11:12.504
Something original.
Okay.

11:12.505 --> 11:14.840
Something personal.

11:14.841 --> 11:16.550
Yeah.
Listen, I totally get it.

11:16.551 --> 11:19.678
So I'm gonna take a little time off and
start working on this thing, okay?

11:19.679 --> 11:21.471
All right.
Here--here's the thing.

11:21.472 --> 11:24.349
You're burned out.
You want to move the blocks around.

11:24.350 --> 11:26.476
You want to reset the table.
I got to move them. Yes.

11:26.477 --> 11:27.352
You need to take a break.

11:27.353 --> 11:29.563
You need to do something a little bit
different, and I totally get that,

11:29.564 --> 11:32.191
and I want-- that's what I want you to do,
'cause I want you to stoke the fire.

11:32.192 --> 11:35.777
'Cause if you take the coal too far away
from the fire, then the coal burns out.

11:35.778 --> 11:38.113
If you put the coal back in the
fire, then the coal's gonna burn.

11:38.114 --> 11:39.406
And I don't want
you to ever think

11:39.407 --> 11:41.742
that anybody has ever
called you a hack writer.

11:41.743 --> 11:43.869
Hack writer? What?

11:43.870 --> 11:45.037
Okay, when you start
writing the pages,

11:45.038 --> 11:46.079
you send 'em over to me.

11:46.080 --> 11:47.581
Wait, Alan.
Hack writer.

11:47.582 --> 11:48.624
What are you talking about?

11:48.625 --> 11:49.958
I'm just telling you
they haven't said it.

11:49.959 --> 11:50.959
What?
I'm gonna go.

11:50.960 --> 11:52.544
Let me know when
you're doing stuff.

11:52.545 --> 11:54.409
Yeah. Okay. Bye.

12:03.765 --> 12:05.557
Ooh, sorry.

12:05.558 --> 12:06.725
Sorry. Sorry.

12:06.726 --> 12:08.260
Ah!

12:14.108 --> 12:16.235
Thanks. I'm really sorry.

12:16.236 --> 12:17.152
Just got in?

12:17.153 --> 12:18.946
I'm sorry. What? Sorry?

12:18.947 --> 12:21.782
Oh, I'm just saying I think
I saw you come in to work.

12:21.783 --> 12:23.075
Oh, yeah.

12:23.076 --> 12:24.493
I am late as usual.

12:24.494 --> 12:25.786
Yeah, always late.

12:27.789 --> 12:28.914
Can I get a refill for you?

12:28.915 --> 12:30.165
Oh, yeah.

12:30.166 --> 12:31.449
Uh, thanks.

12:33.962 --> 12:35.003
Oh, shit!

12:35.004 --> 12:36.672
What? Are you okay?

12:36.673 --> 12:37.589
No. Fuck.

12:37.590 --> 12:39.591
Um, I think someone
just stole my computer.

12:39.592 --> 12:40.592
Oh, God.

12:40.593 --> 12:42.094
Yeah, I had it here,
and I put it in a bag.

12:42.095 --> 12:44.930
It was in a blue computer bag.
I was gonna go to the bathroom.

12:44.931 --> 12:46.640
Do you have another one?
Do you s--hmm?

12:46.641 --> 12:48.334
Besides that one?

12:50.895 --> 12:52.604
No. That's it.

12:52.605 --> 12:53.647
Just that one, actually.

12:54.649 --> 12:55.691
Thanks.

12:55.692 --> 12:58.902
No, it would have been devastating
if you'd lost your masterpiece.

12:58.903 --> 13:00.028
Yeah.
No reason to go on.

13:00.029 --> 13:01.029
I know.

13:01.030 --> 13:04.783
Fortunately, it's just two pages
of bad haikus and dirty limericks.

13:06.452 --> 13:08.078
But you're a doodlist
as well, I see.

13:08.079 --> 13:09.079
Oh, yes.

13:09.080 --> 13:10.289
I just scribble.

13:10.290 --> 13:11.790
I dabble in the doodles myself.

13:11.791 --> 13:12.791
Yeah? Really?

13:12.792 --> 13:14.876
Yeah, I do caricatures
in Prospect Park.

13:14.877 --> 13:15.877
Oh, cool.

13:15.878 --> 13:17.296
Very cool.

13:17.297 --> 13:18.630
I'm sorry.
Is this Gorbachev?

13:18.631 --> 13:20.215
No, no, that's just a creepy guy.

13:20.216 --> 13:21.842
Oh. That's too bad.

13:21.843 --> 13:23.302
I'm a huge Gorbachev fan.

13:23.303 --> 13:26.168
Oh.
Well, this is...

13:28.099 --> 13:29.141
Now it's Gorbachev.

13:29.142 --> 13:30.642
You can Gorbachev anything.
That's really good.

13:30.643 --> 13:32.519
Thanks.

13:32.520 --> 13:33.520
It's Birdie.

13:33.521 --> 13:35.897
It's very birdy.

13:35.898 --> 13:37.762
Oh, my name is Birdie.

13:38.484 --> 13:40.052
Oh, okay. Sorry.

13:41.612 --> 13:42.804
Um...

13:43.906 --> 13:45.157
I'm Sam.

13:45.158 --> 13:46.116
Uh, that's my name.

13:47.076 --> 13:48.327
It's like Pam with an S.

13:48.328 --> 13:49.995
Oh. So--

13:49.996 --> 13:51.079
So Spam.

13:51.080 --> 13:52.956
No, the P is silent.
It's confusing.

13:55.960 --> 13:57.669
I would love to continue
this conversation, but--

13:57.670 --> 13:58.879
Yeah, of course.
Sorry. Yeah.

13:58.880 --> 14:00.464
Sorry.

14:00.465 --> 14:03.342
Large coffee, almond milk, three
Sweet'N Lows, two napkins.

14:03.343 --> 14:04.426
The name's Emily.

14:04.427 --> 14:05.469
Nice to meet you.

14:05.470 --> 14:07.387
Emily, like "Jemily,"

14:07.388 --> 14:08.847
but the J is silent.

14:09.849 --> 14:12.392
Actually, "Gemily" is spelled
with a G, usually.

14:12.393 --> 14:13.435
Is it?

14:13.436 --> 14:15.270
Do you know any Gemilys?

14:15.271 --> 14:16.463
Sorry.

14:35.875 --> 14:37.784
Hey, El, where's the toothpaste?

14:38.878 --> 14:40.491
El.

14:42.465 --> 14:43.965
Hey, what'd you--
Oh, shit!

14:43.966 --> 14:45.467
Shit.
What the fuck?

14:45.468 --> 14:46.551
Sorry.

14:46.552 --> 14:48.637
You can't do that
with the door wide open.

14:48.638 --> 14:50.305
Well, I thought
you were in the shower.

14:50.306 --> 14:52.057
I always wait till
you're in the shower.

14:52.058 --> 14:53.308
You do?
Oh, God.

14:53.309 --> 14:56.395
Now every time I take a shower,
I'm gonna think about that.

14:56.396 --> 14:57.521
Can I turn around?

14:57.522 --> 14:58.714
Yeah.

15:00.108 --> 15:02.818
Is that Princess Leia?

15:02.819 --> 15:04.319
N--yeah.

15:04.320 --> 15:06.363
Are you seriously jerking off

15:06.364 --> 15:09.324
to current pictures
of Carrie Fisher?

15:09.325 --> 15:10.700
Remember when
we were kids, dude?

15:10.701 --> 15:12.994
Correct me if I'm wrong, but you
were pretty obsessed with her too.

15:12.995 --> 15:16.039
Yeah, I was obsessed with her
when she was in Star Wars.

15:16.040 --> 15:17.374
What am I, 12?

15:17.375 --> 15:20.794
You really expect me to pleasure
myself to fucking Star Wars?

15:20.795 --> 15:22.587
What are you talking about?

15:22.588 --> 15:27.551
You can get older, and she can
stay the same age in picture form.

15:27.552 --> 15:30.178
Women, like men, grow up.

15:30.179 --> 15:31.179
Everybody ages.

15:31.180 --> 15:32.722
It's just-- it's a natural fact of life.

15:32.723 --> 15:33.723
You're not dating her.

15:33.724 --> 15:35.600
You're just jerking off to her.

15:35.601 --> 15:36.964
Right.

15:37.603 --> 15:39.104
I--

15:39.105 --> 15:40.188
Okay, yeah.

15:40.189 --> 15:42.023
Just close your door next time.

15:42.024 --> 15:43.608
Can you close it?

15:44.902 --> 15:46.611
Are you going back
into the shower by any chance?

15:46.612 --> 15:47.988
Please don't.

15:47.989 --> 15:49.239
Just please don't.

16:02.295 --> 16:03.658
Excuse me.

16:05.006 --> 16:07.700
Sorry.

16:11.846 --> 16:13.638
Do you by any chance know
what time Birdie--

16:13.639 --> 16:16.725
or it might be
Bertie-- is working?

16:16.726 --> 16:20.353
It's Birdie, like "caw, caw!"

16:20.354 --> 16:21.480
You're a friend of hers?

16:21.481 --> 16:23.470
Uh, yeah, sort of.

16:25.610 --> 16:27.819
She got canned.

16:27.820 --> 16:28.987
What? Why?

16:28.988 --> 16:30.363
What--what happened?

16:30.364 --> 16:31.698
She was late.

16:31.699 --> 16:33.187
For work?

16:33.826 --> 16:35.744
No.

16:35.745 --> 16:37.913
For her fucking period.

16:37.914 --> 16:39.247
What--

16:39.248 --> 16:40.290
I'm sorry.

16:40.291 --> 16:41.833
I don't know what's g--

16:41.834 --> 16:44.669
I f-feel like maybe we got off
on the wrong foot.

16:44.670 --> 16:46.087
I'm Sam, by the way.

16:46.088 --> 16:47.280
Okay.

16:47.632 --> 16:49.591
And your name is...

16:49.592 --> 16:51.134
It's Gerard.

16:51.135 --> 16:53.136
Gerard.

16:53.137 --> 16:54.500
Strard.

16:55.598 --> 16:56.723
Stre--Gerard.

16:56.724 --> 16:57.891
Strard.
Stard.

16:57.892 --> 16:59.518
Strard.
Chard.

16:59.519 --> 17:01.394
Leave it.

17:01.395 --> 17:03.355
Anyway.

17:03.356 --> 17:04.522
What happened with Birdie?

17:04.523 --> 17:06.148
I already told you;
she was late.

17:06.150 --> 17:08.777
Oh--right.

17:08.778 --> 17:09.778
But j-just--

17:09.779 --> 17:11.530
Anything else, Inspector Watson?

17:11.531 --> 17:12.614
No, that's--that's great.

17:12.615 --> 17:14.308
Thanks for--

17:18.412 --> 17:21.248
Do you think maybe
she'll come back here?

17:21.249 --> 17:22.499
For what?

17:22.500 --> 17:23.541
I don't know.

17:23.542 --> 17:24.667
Me, neither.

17:24.669 --> 17:26.907
Why don't you just find her online?

17:27.505 --> 17:28.463
I don't know her--

17:28.464 --> 17:30.048
Birdie Hazel.

17:30.049 --> 17:32.509
Hazel.

17:32.510 --> 17:33.702
Okay.

17:34.387 --> 17:36.054
Thank--

17:36.055 --> 17:38.089
Thanks, G-sir.

17:42.728 --> 17:44.563
Okay.
I think I got everything.

17:44.564 --> 17:46.064
Where you guys going?

17:46.065 --> 17:47.065
I told you a trillion times.

17:47.066 --> 17:48.233
We're going to Ashley's
parents' place,

17:48.234 --> 17:49.401
then we're going
to Sacred Spirit.

17:49.402 --> 17:50.902
Oh, right.
Camp Brainwash.

17:50.903 --> 17:53.071
Eliot, don't forget
your camera.

17:53.072 --> 17:54.406
I think it's on the desk.

17:54.407 --> 17:55.865
Oh, yes.
Bye!

17:55.866 --> 17:57.434
Bye!

18:00.997 --> 18:03.039
Hey, El, I found Birdie's
online profile.

18:03.040 --> 18:04.457
You did? Who?

18:04.458 --> 18:05.946
You know, the coffee shop girl.

18:07.420 --> 18:09.629
Pretty amazing, actually.

18:09.630 --> 18:11.840
Oh, yeah? Nice, man.
Yeah. You got to see this.

18:11.841 --> 18:12.716
I don't know what to do.

18:12.717 --> 18:13.758
What's the next move?

18:13.759 --> 18:15.260
Write her a message
saying you want to see her.

18:15.261 --> 18:16.928
Really?

18:16.929 --> 18:18.346
Should I?
That seems weird.

18:18.347 --> 18:19.931
Just, like, a blind message?

18:19.932 --> 18:22.100
I don't-- I don't know
anything about her.

18:22.101 --> 18:23.476
Yeah.
Sure, you do.

18:23.477 --> 18:25.687
That's the beauty of getting
to see her Facebook profile.

18:25.688 --> 18:27.272
There's so much information
on there, you know?

18:27.273 --> 18:28.815
I mean, hell, you could become
the man of her dreams

18:28.816 --> 18:29.858
if you wanted.

18:29.859 --> 18:31.276
That's true.

18:31.277 --> 18:32.277
You know?

18:32.278 --> 18:33.612
Baby?
Yeah.

18:33.613 --> 18:35.363
Come on.
I'm double-parked.

18:35.364 --> 18:36.807
What are you doing?
Oh, shit.

18:37.283 --> 18:38.325
See you next week, playa.

18:38.326 --> 18:39.985
See you.

18:47.251 --> 18:51.588
<i>♪ G, D, B minor, A ♪</i>

18:51.589 --> 18:53.828
<i>♪ G, G ♪</i>

18:54.967 --> 18:56.509
Play a G.

18:56.510 --> 18:58.303
Oh. Uh, okay.
Play a G.

18:58.304 --> 18:59.304
I'm not sure I got that one.

18:59.305 --> 19:02.474
Index finger goes on
the-- is that a fret?

19:02.475 --> 19:03.683
It's called a fret.

19:03.684 --> 19:05.143
Sorry.
I don't know--

19:05.144 --> 19:06.561
You got to bar it.

19:06.562 --> 19:07.979
Ow. Ow.

19:07.980 --> 19:09.606
Okay. That's it?

19:10.608 --> 19:12.525
It sounded different than yours.

19:12.526 --> 19:17.656
If you stop with the 'tude
and the condescending shit,

19:17.657 --> 19:18.657
I can--

19:18.658 --> 19:21.159
Music is about opening.

19:21.160 --> 19:26.956
Your generation is so...
sexy, and they know it,

19:26.957 --> 19:28.525
and they're texting.

19:30.711 --> 19:33.004
Just 'cause you got my
number off a telephone pole

19:33.005 --> 19:35.382
doesn't mean I'm not ferocious
on the ax.

19:35.383 --> 19:37.926
I played fucking Woodstock, man.

19:37.927 --> 19:39.540
Woodstock? Really?

19:40.346 --> 19:42.180
That's kind of--

19:42.181 --> 19:43.723
'Cause you don't
really seem that--

19:43.724 --> 19:46.059
Woodstock '99, captain!

19:46.060 --> 19:47.686
So you want to fuck with that?

19:47.687 --> 19:50.480
I played backup with the fucking
Spin Doctors, bro-rometer.

19:50.481 --> 19:51.481
Wow.

19:51.482 --> 19:52.649
Yeah, wow.

19:52.650 --> 19:53.733
That's pretty cool.

19:53.734 --> 19:55.527
It's really cool.

19:55.528 --> 19:56.736
Look it up.

19:56.737 --> 19:58.154
I will.
I'll Google it.

19:58.155 --> 19:59.823
Yeah, do that.
Okay.

19:59.824 --> 20:01.783
I didn't technically
play backup,

20:01.784 --> 20:04.828
but I was backing them up
from a choice seat backstage.

20:04.829 --> 20:07.372
I'm pretty tight
with Chris Barron's brother.

20:07.373 --> 20:09.541
Is he-- is he in the Spin Doctors?

20:09.542 --> 20:11.167
Are you effin' fucking with me?

20:11.168 --> 20:13.169
I-I don't--

20:13.170 --> 20:14.629
Is this Punk'd?
Am I punk'd?

20:14.630 --> 20:16.089
Are you Ashley Kutcher?

20:16.090 --> 20:17.090
Ashton.

20:17.091 --> 20:18.216
Who doesn't know Chris Barron?

20:18.217 --> 20:19.175
I don't.
I'm sorry.

20:19.176 --> 20:20.635
He's the original doc.

20:20.636 --> 20:23.096
He hooked me up
with backstage passes,

20:23.097 --> 20:25.390
and we did enough K
to date-rape a horse.

20:25.391 --> 20:26.266
What's K?

20:26.267 --> 20:29.227
And you want to be a rock star.

20:29.228 --> 20:32.063
Without K, the Spin Doctors
would be Spin Nurses.

20:32.064 --> 20:34.899
It's a fucking horse
tranquilizer, champion.

20:34.900 --> 20:36.985
Gary, I totally respect
your musical background,

20:36.986 --> 20:38.653
and that's why
I just really want you

20:38.654 --> 20:40.363
to teach me how to play.

20:40.364 --> 20:41.406
Yeah? Why?

20:41.407 --> 20:42.407
I just want to--

20:42.408 --> 20:44.284
Why?

20:44.285 --> 20:45.477
I just want to learn.

20:46.412 --> 20:47.620
Nobody just wants to learn.

20:47.621 --> 20:49.456
You either want money,
pussy, or fame.

20:49.457 --> 20:50.957
Which one is it?

20:50.958 --> 20:52.000
I just want to learn.

20:52.001 --> 20:53.084
Money, pussy, or fame?

20:53.085 --> 20:54.085
I want to--

20:54.086 --> 20:55.545
Which one is it?

20:55.546 --> 20:56.755
Well, then, okay.

20:56.756 --> 20:57.756
Well, there's--there's a girl.

20:57.757 --> 20:59.340
So it's pussy.

20:59.341 --> 21:01.176
Yeah, fine, I guess.

21:01.177 --> 21:02.719
Well, does she have a pussy?

21:02.720 --> 21:04.971
Can you just tell me
where the G is please?

21:04.972 --> 21:08.266
It's right above the
clit, inside the pussy.

21:08.267 --> 21:09.934
The G chord.

21:09.935 --> 21:11.603
Can you--what are you doing?

21:11.604 --> 21:14.230
If you just listen...

21:14.231 --> 21:15.273
Shh!

21:15.274 --> 21:17.192
And stop fucking around,

21:17.193 --> 21:19.637
Dr. Gary Garren will teach
you a thing or three.

21:20.696 --> 21:21.738

21:21.739 --> 21:23.022

23:38.918 --> 23:39.918

I can't tap out.

23:39.919 --> 23:41.044
Tap out.

23:43.797 --> 23:46.215
Oh, my God.

23:46.216 --> 23:48.785
Holy Jesus.

23:56.226 --> 23:57.602
Hey, Gerard.
Hey.

23:57.603 --> 24:01.094
I'm here to pick up
my last paycheck.

24:01.774 --> 24:03.024
Somebody stole it.

24:03.025 --> 24:05.109
What?

24:05.110 --> 24:06.778
I'm joking.
Jesus!

24:06.779 --> 24:10.073
Don't get your boy shorts
in a panty bundle.

24:10.074 --> 24:12.484
How could someone possibly
steal it and then cash it?

24:13.369 --> 24:14.535
I-I-I don't know.

24:14.536 --> 24:16.579
Exactly, genius.

24:16.580 --> 24:17.956
I stole it and tried to cash it.

24:17.957 --> 24:19.491
Didn't work.

24:20.417 --> 24:22.168
Great.
Well...

24:22.169 --> 24:27.674
I'm just glad it's still here.
Did he find you?

24:27.675 --> 24:29.425
Who?

24:29.426 --> 24:31.636
That Laotian boy.

24:31.637 --> 24:33.375
Oh, you can run,
but you can't hide.

24:34.306 --> 24:37.292
When you're done with
him, give him my digits.

24:38.978 --> 24:40.269
Okay.

24:40.270 --> 24:43.856
I don't--I don't know what you're talking
about, so I'm just gonna take this.

24:43.857 --> 24:45.316
Thank you.

24:45.317 --> 24:47.318

Oh, man.
You missed--

25:32.489 --> 25:33.573
Oh, shit!

25:33.574 --> 25:35.366
I got to flip the mahi.

25:46.211 --> 25:48.212
Should have done the medallions.

What is going on, man?

25:49.840 --> 25:52.467
Oh, I...

25:52.468 --> 25:54.502
found some inspiration.

25:54.970 --> 25:56.012
Cocaine?

25:57.139 --> 25:58.056
No, no, no.

25:58.057 --> 26:01.392
Let's just say a little
bird helped me out.

26:01.393 --> 26:03.561
I'm not--not getting it.

26:03.562 --> 26:05.605
Birdie! Duh.

26:05.606 --> 26:06.773
The coffee shop girl.

26:06.774 --> 26:07.982
Birdie. Right.

26:07.983 --> 26:09.650
Can you turn that down a little?

26:09.651 --> 26:11.069
Way down.

26:11.070 --> 26:12.945
Sorry, man.
Sorry.

26:12.946 --> 26:14.605
Listen, I got
to tell you something.

26:15.365 --> 26:17.742
I haven't felt this way
in such a long time.

26:17.743 --> 26:19.285
I feel this, like, uh--

26:19.286 --> 26:21.730
like a jolt, you know,
like a--like a thump.

26:22.414 --> 26:23.831
Don't say spark.
A spark.

26:23.832 --> 26:24.874
It's true.

26:24.875 --> 26:25.958
I can't explain it
any other way.

26:25.959 --> 26:28.073
It's this--this intangible
feeling that...

26:29.254 --> 26:30.463
Feels pretty good.

26:30.464 --> 26:32.157
I love that, man.
That's great.

26:32.841 --> 26:33.883
Oh, shit.
Is she coming over?

26:33.884 --> 26:34.759
You want me to go to Ashley's?

26:34.760 --> 26:36.094
Oh, no, she's not coming here.

26:36.095 --> 26:37.095
Oh, she's not?
Yeah.

26:37.096 --> 26:38.387
That's great, though.
You guys been hanging?

26:38.388 --> 26:39.555
No.

26:39.556 --> 26:41.307
You been talking on the phone
with her?

26:41.308 --> 26:43.101
No.
A little online chatting?

26:43.102 --> 26:45.103
Not quite.

26:45.104 --> 26:46.979
See, I'm getting
a little creeped out, man.

26:46.980 --> 26:49.107
I'm doing exactly
what you said.

26:49.108 --> 26:50.775
What I told you to do?
Yeah.

26:50.776 --> 26:51.943
I'm becoming the man
of her dreams.

26:51.944 --> 26:53.611
I don't think that that--

26:53.612 --> 26:55.446
I'm preparing
for the moment to arise.

26:55.447 --> 26:57.198
I've been studying
her Facebook page all week.

26:57.199 --> 26:58.449
I know it backwards
and forwards.

26:58.450 --> 27:00.368
I'm visualizing the whole thing.

27:00.369 --> 27:01.994
I got it.

27:01.995 --> 27:02.995
Okay. How 'bout this?

27:02.996 --> 27:03.996
Yeah?

27:03.997 --> 27:06.707
Visualize writing her a message

27:06.708 --> 27:09.460
but then literally do it
right now.

27:09.461 --> 27:11.629
Write her a message r-right now?

27:11.630 --> 27:12.839
Yeah.

27:12.840 --> 27:14.328
Okay.
You know what?

27:15.175 --> 27:16.968
Screw it.
You're right.

27:16.969 --> 27:17.969
Let's do this.

27:17.970 --> 27:19.762
All right.

27:19.763 --> 27:21.097
This is the moment.

27:21.098 --> 27:22.807
Carpe diem.

27:22.808 --> 27:25.393
Um... okay, so what--what do I write?

27:25.394 --> 27:27.520
Uh, uh, uh...

27:27.521 --> 27:29.021
Got it.
Okay.

27:29.022 --> 27:33.568
"I love and invite my soul"...
What's this? What is this?

27:33.569 --> 27:34.986
This is Leaves of Grass.
Walt Whitman.

27:34.987 --> 27:36.154
Birdie loves Whitman.

27:36.155 --> 27:37.655
No.
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

27:37.656 --> 27:39.240
Really?
Why? Why? Why?

27:39.241 --> 27:40.783
Dude, look at this.
Look.

27:40.784 --> 27:42.827
"Hey, babe, I hope you're still
coming to my show on Tuesday.

27:42.828 --> 27:44.162
LOL, Jackie."
Who's Jackie?

27:44.163 --> 27:45.496
It's Jackie Williams.

27:45.497 --> 27:47.456
She's a-- she's an aspiring actress.

27:47.457 --> 27:49.167
Their parents are family friends.

27:49.168 --> 27:50.918
She loves Kathy Griffin.
She's an Aquarius.

27:50.919 --> 27:52.712
She does the show on Tuesday
night at UCB Improv.

27:52.713 --> 27:53.796
Oh. my God.

27:53.797 --> 27:55.840
It's really disturbing you
know that, but that's your in.

27:55.841 --> 27:56.841
Well, it's all in--

27:56.842 --> 28:00.928
What do you mean, that's my in?
I'm gonna go to some shitty improv show,

28:00.929 --> 28:03.639
sit through the whole thing, just so
I can stare at her in the audience?

28:03.640 --> 28:04.724
You--No, you--

28:04.725 --> 28:06.350
so you can talk to her.

28:06.351 --> 28:07.852
All right, flower, grow!

28:07.853 --> 28:09.937
Grow! Grow! Grow! Faster!

28:09.938 --> 28:11.689
Why don't you grow faster, flower?

28:11.690 --> 28:13.024
Now, run around.
Ahh!

28:13.025 --> 28:14.567
Yeah, but you love that flower.

28:14.568 --> 28:16.110
Tell that flower
that you love her.

28:16.111 --> 28:18.362
The chestnut
that turned into a flower,

28:18.363 --> 28:21.365
to turn it into growing water,
then turn into something big.

28:21.366 --> 28:23.275
It was chestnuts!

28:31.168 --> 28:32.576
That was pretty funny.

28:33.795 --> 28:36.580
Hey-- Can I get,
uh, one of these?

28:50.187 --> 28:52.021
Oh, my God.
Wait, wait.

28:52.022 --> 28:53.231
Oh.

28:53.232 --> 28:55.733
Do you ever go
to the Second Stop Café?

28:55.734 --> 28:59.403
Well, where is that...
Oh, Gorbachev!

28:59.404 --> 29:00.404
Sam.

29:00.405 --> 29:01.447
That's it!
Yeah. Yeah.

29:01.448 --> 29:03.074
Birdie.
Birdie? Bird--yeah.

29:03.075 --> 29:04.450
What have you been up to?
What have you been up to?

29:04.451 --> 29:05.409
I--Jesus.

29:05.410 --> 29:06.410
Oh, no.

29:07.371 --> 29:09.664
Um, nothing.
Just, uh, watching...

29:09.665 --> 29:11.415
Really bad improv.

29:11.416 --> 29:12.416
Glad you said that.

29:12.417 --> 29:14.001
It was-- yikes.

29:14.002 --> 29:16.045
Though I commend them
for their courage.

29:16.046 --> 29:18.256
I would never have the nerve
to get onstage like that

29:18.257 --> 29:20.633
if I didn't have a guitar
in my hands.

29:20.634 --> 29:21.759
You play guitar?

29:21.760 --> 29:23.386
Yeah, yeah, a little bit.

29:23.387 --> 29:24.845
Just--just to relax and stuff.

29:24.846 --> 29:26.222
Very nice.
Mellow stuff, yeah.

29:26.223 --> 29:27.473
Joan Baez kind of stuff.

29:27.474 --> 29:28.683
Oh, you like Joan Baez?

29:28.684 --> 29:29.767
I love Joan Baez!

29:29.768 --> 29:30.768
She's the best! Yeah!

29:30.769 --> 29:31.769
No, she's my favorite.

29:31.770 --> 29:32.895
Oh, my God.
Are you kidding?

29:32.896 --> 29:34.063
I grew up with her.

29:34.064 --> 29:35.648
Not literally, but--
Right.

29:35.649 --> 29:37.441
She's amazing.
Diamonds and Rust.

29:37.442 --> 29:39.944
Dude, every time I walk
into Washington Square,

29:39.945 --> 29:41.028
I think of that.

29:41.029 --> 29:41.988
Me too.

29:41.989 --> 29:43.114
"Now you're smiling,
looking out the window

29:43.115 --> 29:45.783
"of that crummy hotel
over Washington Square.

29:45.784 --> 29:48.286
"Our breath comes out white clouds,
mingles, hangs in the air."

29:48.287 --> 29:49.287
Oh!

29:49.288 --> 29:50.454
I know. Oh, my God.
It's so good.

29:50.455 --> 29:51.956
Every time I'm in the park,
I think that.

29:51.957 --> 29:53.240
Yeah.

29:54.042 --> 29:57.795
Well, um, listen, next time
I'm in the ol' Second Stop,

29:57.796 --> 29:59.839
you got to give me the
Joan Baez fan discount.

29:59.840 --> 30:01.007
I would love to.

30:01.008 --> 30:03.801
It might be a little hard
now since I was fired.

30:03.802 --> 30:05.803
I know... now.

30:05.804 --> 30:06.929
Now I know.

30:06.930 --> 30:07.972
Uh, that sucks.

30:07.973 --> 30:09.849
I'm glad that
I ran into you here, though.

30:09.850 --> 30:11.267
Yeah, me too.

30:11.268 --> 30:12.476
Hey. hey, hey, hey!

30:12.477 --> 30:13.644
Oh, hey, girl.

30:13.645 --> 30:14.937
Oh, you were so good, so good.

30:14.938 --> 30:16.147
Thanks for coming.
Thank you.

30:16.148 --> 30:17.982
Literally, you couldn't have
picked a better night,

30:17.983 --> 30:20.268
except for that skank
who kept cutting me off.

30:21.445 --> 30:22.611
Uh, well,

30:22.612 --> 30:24.488
J--Jackie, uh, Sam.

30:24.489 --> 30:25.948
Hey.
Hey, Sam.

30:25.949 --> 30:28.909
Um, Sam was just saying
something about the show, right?

30:28.910 --> 30:30.202
What is it that you were saying?

30:30.203 --> 30:33.998
Ah, well, we were laughing...
Thank God.

30:33.999 --> 30:36.667
And saying that we will
never forget this night.

30:36.668 --> 30:38.127
That was it.
It was very memorable.

30:38.128 --> 30:39.128
Literally?

30:39.129 --> 30:40.129
Yep.
Thanks.

30:40.130 --> 30:42.506
So do you know someone
in the troupe, or...

30:42.507 --> 30:43.507
No. I just--

30:43.508 --> 30:45.426
I enjoy the art form.

30:45.427 --> 30:47.178
Art form? Wow.

30:47.179 --> 30:48.471
Thank you, Sam.

30:48.472 --> 30:49.555
Dibs.

30:54.519 --> 30:56.145
So do you have to--

30:56.146 --> 30:57.396
No.
Oh.

31:00.901 --> 31:02.890
Can I cook you dinner sometime?

31:04.654 --> 31:06.188
Hey!

31:07.866 --> 31:08.991
Oh, sorry.

31:08.992 --> 31:11.577
Okay, I need some scented
candles, dried flowers,

31:11.578 --> 31:13.829
incense--either Passion
or Don Juan brand--

31:13.830 --> 31:16.457
and, uh, there's something else
that I didn't write down.

31:16.458 --> 31:17.458
Oh, sage.

31:17.459 --> 31:19.168
Do you sell sage?

31:19.169 --> 31:20.878
Great.

32:18.437 --> 32:19.437
Sam, hey.

32:19.438 --> 32:21.605
I am so sorry.
I got caught up.

32:21.606 --> 32:22.648
Yeah, totally.

32:22.649 --> 32:23.649
That's cool.

32:23.650 --> 32:24.775
I wasn't sure
if you remembered--

32:24.776 --> 32:26.944
I'm at the hospital, actually.

32:26.945 --> 32:27.945
Oh, my God.

32:27.946 --> 32:29.488
I'm fine.

32:29.489 --> 32:30.698
Mm.

32:30.699 --> 32:35.536
My ex is a carpenter, actually,
and he hurt his hand...

32:35.537 --> 32:37.705
And he didn't have anyone else
to drive him.

32:37.706 --> 32:41.000
That's--that's actually
a really nice thing to do.

32:41.001 --> 32:43.069
He would do
the same thing for me.

32:43.628 --> 32:45.171
Well, I really want to make it
up to you.

32:45.172 --> 32:46.964
I take a ballroom class every Thursday,

32:46.965 --> 32:48.466
if you're interested.

32:48.467 --> 32:51.218
Oh, I also do ballroom.

32:51.219 --> 32:52.595
You do?
Yup.

32:52.596 --> 32:54.013
Honestly, though,
I haven't done it

32:54.014 --> 32:56.390
since I was really,
really young, but...

32:56.391 --> 32:58.767
Well, you better find
something snazzy to wear.

32:58.768 --> 32:59.768
Okay.

32:59.769 --> 33:00.811
I will.

33:00.812 --> 33:02.354
All right.
I'll talk to you then.

33:02.355 --> 33:03.606
Okay, good.
Good.

33:03.607 --> 33:04.607
All right.

33:04.608 --> 33:06.142
Bye.
Bye.

33:07.486 --> 33:09.020
Okay.

33:29.132 --> 33:30.841
I like--I like your outfit.

33:30.842 --> 33:33.427
Thanks.

33:33.428 --> 33:36.013
What do you--where are
your dancing clothes?

33:36.014 --> 33:37.014
Oh, I've got 'em on.

33:37.015 --> 33:38.015
They're just under here.

33:38.016 --> 33:39.850
It's just like a wife
beater and a T-shirt.

33:39.851 --> 33:41.589
Yeah?
Yeah.

33:43.522 --> 33:45.356
I think I'm gonna go home
and change really quick.

33:45.357 --> 33:46.357
Oh, no, no.
Come on.

33:46.358 --> 33:49.235
I misinterpreted what you said.

33:49.236 --> 33:50.528
Just take your jacket off
a second.

33:50.529 --> 33:51.862
I'm sure it's fine.

33:51.863 --> 33:55.699
Okay, I-I-I got to--
I just got to tell you,

33:55.700 --> 33:59.161
when I was dancing, they wore different
things, and you said, "snazzy."

33:59.162 --> 34:00.329
I know.
I did say snazzy.

34:00.330 --> 34:04.542
Okay, really quick, but you can't laugh,
or else I'm jumping out of the cab.

34:05.627 --> 34:07.294
Okay.
No, no! I don't--

34:07.295 --> 34:09.380
I mean, that was a--
that was a laugh of excitement

34:09.380 --> 34:11.215
because it's so snazzy.

34:11.216 --> 34:12.716
Can I go home?
I'm just gonna put a T-shirt--

34:12.717 --> 34:14.134
I think it's great.
I think it's great.

34:14.135 --> 34:16.428
Some people dress up,
so it's okay.

34:16.429 --> 34:18.246
Oh, no.
And we're here anyway, so...

34:19.266 --> 34:20.599
It's gonna be fine.
I got you.

34:20.600 --> 34:21.934
I promise it's gonna be--
it's gonna be fine.

34:21.935 --> 34:23.628
Oh, please. Okay.

34:24.478 --> 34:25.688
Oh, uh, sorry, sir.

34:25.688 --> 34:28.315
How much--how much do I owe you?

34:28.315 --> 34:29.400
What are you doing?

34:35.322 --> 34:36.322
Oh, it's right here.

34:36.324 --> 34:37.812
Oh, okay.

34:40.286 --> 34:41.328
Hey.

34:41.329 --> 34:42.329
Hey!

34:42.330 --> 34:44.081
Birdie, what have we got here?

34:44.081 --> 34:48.043
Harriet, Henry, this is
my new recruit, Sam.

34:48.043 --> 34:49.043
Oh, Sam.

34:49.045 --> 34:51.088
Raymond's not gonna be pleased.

34:51.089 --> 34:52.873
Ah, he'll be fine.

34:53.550 --> 34:54.967
Hey.
Oh.

34:54.967 --> 34:55.967
Nice threads.

34:55.969 --> 34:56.969
Oh, thank you.

34:56.969 --> 34:57.970
You a pro?

34:57.971 --> 34:59.263
No. Are you?

34:59.264 --> 35:00.931
How do you define a pro?

35:00.932 --> 35:04.810
Well, it's someone who
gets paid for dancing, I guess.

35:04.811 --> 35:06.812
Oh, not with money.

35:06.813 --> 35:08.314
We get rewards in other ways.

35:08.315 --> 35:09.315
Ah.

35:09.316 --> 35:10.316
Pride.

35:10.317 --> 35:11.275
Right.
Roberto.

35:11.276 --> 35:12.276
Oh, hi. Sam.

35:12.277 --> 35:13.277
Mercedes.

35:13.278 --> 35:14.278
Oh, hello.

35:14.279 --> 35:15.279
Hi.

35:15.280 --> 35:17.615
We've won this thing
for the last three years.

35:17.616 --> 35:19.400
Don't get any ideas.

35:20.368 --> 35:21.560
Okay.

35:23.455 --> 35:24.455
Wow.

35:24.456 --> 35:25.914
It's not a competition.

35:25.915 --> 35:27.291
Oh.

35:27.292 --> 35:28.292
Did someone tell them that?

35:29.294 --> 35:30.794
So let me get this straight:

35:30.795 --> 35:34.632
you write novels for
movies that already exist.

35:34.633 --> 35:36.258
Yes. Yep.

35:36.259 --> 35:39.928
Did you see, um, you
know, Teen Vampire?

35:39.929 --> 35:41.305
That--that was huge.

35:41.306 --> 35:42.514
The movie was, yeah.

35:42.515 --> 35:46.185
The novelization was not so much.
I'm gonna read it anyway.

35:46.186 --> 35:48.771
You don't have to read it, really.

35:48.772 --> 35:50.189
Just rent the movie.

35:50.190 --> 35:51.815
What's your favorite book?

35:51.816 --> 35:54.476
The Teachings of Don Juan:
A Yaqui Way of Knowledge.

35:55.904 --> 35:56.945
Are you serious?

35:56.946 --> 35:58.656
What?
That's my favorite book.

35:58.657 --> 35:59.823
What?
Yeah!

35:59.824 --> 36:02.117
Oh, when he turns
into the-- The crow.

36:02.118 --> 36:03.410
Dude, I tripped out in college.

36:03.411 --> 36:05.663
I tripped out so hard.

36:05.664 --> 36:07.790
First day on the job, rookie?

36:07.791 --> 36:08.832
No.

36:08.833 --> 36:09.875
First day on the job, rookie?

36:09.876 --> 36:10.876
Okay, he just said that.

36:10.877 --> 36:11.877
What's with those two?

36:11.878 --> 36:13.712
Ah, don't listen to 'em.

36:13.713 --> 36:15.047
Oh!

36:15.048 --> 36:16.090
Yeah, see?

36:17.092 --> 36:18.801
You actually have some
pretty sweet moves.

36:18.802 --> 36:20.344
Oh, thanks.

36:20.345 --> 36:21.845
Must be all the judo training.

36:21.846 --> 36:23.347
Deep into judo.

36:24.766 --> 36:26.016
What?

36:26.017 --> 36:27.184
What's so funny?
Nothing. No.

36:27.185 --> 36:28.852
I just...

36:28.853 --> 36:31.855
My parents' dog's name is Judo,

36:31.856 --> 36:34.692
and you said, "deep into judo."

36:34.693 --> 36:35.818
That just sounded funny.

36:35.819 --> 36:36.902
I'm an infant.

36:37.904 --> 36:38.904
Yeah.

36:38.905 --> 36:40.989
Your parents' dog is named Judo?

36:40.990 --> 36:42.032
Yeah.

36:42.867 --> 36:44.560
That is funny,

36:49.457 --> 36:51.333
Invite her to the next
Sacred Spirit retreat.

36:51.334 --> 36:52.543
This one's only one night.

36:52.544 --> 36:53.544
You kidding?

36:53.545 --> 36:55.033
No. I actually like this girl.

36:57.966 --> 36:59.258
You drinking whiskey?

36:59.259 --> 37:01.802
Bourbon.
Bourbon?

37:01.803 --> 37:02.995
I hate it so much.

37:03.847 --> 37:05.097
It's her favorite, though.

37:05.098 --> 37:06.632
Got to build up my immunity.

37:08.393 --> 37:10.394
Are you okay?

37:10.395 --> 37:11.883
It's so smooth.

37:14.733 --> 37:16.400
<i>♪ L.O.V. for you and me ♪</i>

37:16.401 --> 37:18.811

37:22.615 --> 37:24.241
<i>♪ L.O.V. for you and me ♪</i>

<i>♪ That's just the way ♪</i>

37:25.243 --> 37:27.953
Hey, Gerard, what's
another word for "smitten"?

37:27.954 --> 37:29.146
"Horny."

37:30.415 --> 37:34.001

that actually likes doing this.

This is so exciting, right?

38:05.283 --> 38:06.283
I wish I could draw.

38:06.284 --> 38:08.022
That is such a dope talent.

38:08.369 --> 38:09.369
You know, this one here

38:09.370 --> 38:10.871
is quite the talented artist himself.

38:10.872 --> 38:11.872
Yeah, right.

38:11.873 --> 38:13.123
I'm--no, I'm not.

38:13.124 --> 38:14.124
I'm not as--

38:14.125 --> 38:15.292
not as dope as she is.

38:17.295 --> 38:19.113
Oh, my God.
That's so funny.

38:23.134 --> 38:24.827
These are so good.

38:27.430 --> 38:28.722
Do you have, like, a time frame

38:28.723 --> 38:31.058
to make it doing
drawing or whatever?

38:31.059 --> 38:32.718
Well, what do you mean,
"make it"?

38:33.353 --> 38:35.046
Success is a myth.

38:35.730 --> 38:38.065
Love's the only true currency.

38:38.066 --> 38:40.818
After all this is done,

38:40.819 --> 38:44.105
all that really matters
is how and who you loved.

38:45.448 --> 38:46.448
But there must be something

38:46.449 --> 38:48.826
that you're working toward, right?

38:48.827 --> 38:50.202
This.

38:50.203 --> 38:52.162
What do you mean, this?

38:52.163 --> 38:55.332
This brings me happiness.

38:55.333 --> 38:57.000
You know, and maybe, you know,

38:57.001 --> 38:59.945
in a week or maybe a year
from now, it won't, but...

39:01.130 --> 39:03.699
You know, then I'll just move on
to the next thing that does.

39:07.637 --> 39:08.637
All right.

39:08.638 --> 39:09.638
Looks good.

39:09.639 --> 39:11.056
I think-- I think we're done, yeah.

39:11.057 --> 39:12.724
It's about time.

39:12.725 --> 39:14.726
You two are such a rad couple.

39:14.727 --> 39:17.020
You both draw or whatever.
It's so cool.

39:17.021 --> 39:20.557
I remember when Kyle first--
Hey, let's go. Sorry.

39:21.526 --> 39:22.526
Good luck.

39:22.527 --> 39:23.810
Good luck to you.

39:24.863 --> 39:26.306
Yeesh.

39:27.240 --> 39:29.074
You must not be able
to always draw people

39:29.075 --> 39:30.367
completely accurately

39:30.368 --> 39:31.577
at the risk of offending
them, I imagine.

39:31.578 --> 39:32.786
Oh, yeah, yeah.

39:32.787 --> 39:34.454
Well, every now and then,
you get someone that's, like,

39:34.455 --> 39:35.706
slightly offended.

39:35.707 --> 39:37.875
I kind of miss Kyle
in a weird way.

39:37.876 --> 39:40.252
Yeah, well, we'll always have
the memory of Kyle

39:40.253 --> 39:41.253
in our hearts.

39:41.254 --> 39:42.254
Yeah, that's true.
That's true.

39:42.255 --> 39:43.714
We can always look back
and smile.

39:50.471 --> 39:51.663
What?

39:52.557 --> 39:54.000
Nothing.
I'm...

39:55.685 --> 39:57.227
Just glad I met you.

39:57.228 --> 39:58.796
That's all.

40:01.900 --> 40:02.900
I was--

40:02.901 --> 40:04.109
Oh.

40:04.110 --> 40:05.319
Sorry.
Sorry.

40:05.320 --> 40:06.987
Um...

40:06.988 --> 40:08.071
I'm sorry.
That was--

40:08.072 --> 40:09.531
I was supposed to kiss you
on the cheek.

40:09.532 --> 40:10.770
Right.

40:28.843 --> 40:31.503
I'm supposed to kiss
you on the cheek too.

40:39.395 --> 40:40.633
Are you free tonight?

40:42.982 --> 40:44.107
Yeah.
Yeah?

40:44.108 --> 40:45.300
Sure.

40:46.861 --> 40:50.113
<i>♪ The future's
still a mystery ♪</i>

40:50.114 --> 40:51.990
So your ex--
your ex is singing tonight?

40:51.991 --> 40:52.991
This is the one from the hospital?

40:52.992 --> 40:54.201
Yes, Tony.
Oh, okay.

40:54.202 --> 40:55.202
Oh, cool.

40:55.203 --> 40:57.287
He's really cool,
and he just got back from, like,

40:57.288 --> 40:58.872
traveling all around the world.

40:58.873 --> 40:59.873
Wow.

40:59.874 --> 41:01.291
Yeah. I can't wait for you
to meet him, though.

41:01.292 --> 41:02.459
He's gonna love you.

41:02.460 --> 41:05.545
Oh, I can't wait
to be loved by him.

41:06.839 --> 41:08.507
So I thought you said, um--

41:08.508 --> 41:11.343
I mean, isn't he a carpenter or...
Yeah, yeah.

41:11.344 --> 41:13.679
Well, you know,
Tony is an interesting one,

41:13.680 --> 41:16.306
because he kind of does, like,
a little bit of everything,

41:16.307 --> 41:17.641
so he just got into carpentry,

41:17.642 --> 41:19.017
and he's just been doing it on the side

41:19.018 --> 41:20.018
for friends and family.

41:20.019 --> 41:21.353
Oh, very cool.

41:21.354 --> 41:22.354
Yeah.

41:22.355 --> 41:23.647
Nice.
He's like a jack-of-all-trades.

41:23.648 --> 41:24.815
Exactly.
I can't wait to meet him.

41:24.816 --> 41:25.816
Hey!
Jesus Christ.

41:25.817 --> 41:26.858
Hey, man!
Tony!

41:26.859 --> 41:28.318
Oh, Tony, hey.
It's you, right?

41:28.319 --> 41:29.319
Hey. How's it going?

41:29.320 --> 41:30.862
I am so fucking glad
to meet you.

41:30.863 --> 41:32.322
Yeah. Fucking good
to meet you.

41:32.323 --> 41:33.365
Thanks for coming up.

41:33.366 --> 41:35.325
Mm. Wow. Looking good.

41:35.326 --> 41:36.326
Thanks.

41:36.327 --> 41:37.327
I love you, babe.

41:37.328 --> 41:38.328
Oh, you know I wouldn't miss it.

41:38.329 --> 41:39.538
Yeah?

41:39.539 --> 41:41.665
Come on. Let's get this
musical debacle started.

41:41.666 --> 41:42.749
We're so excited.
Yeah.

41:42.750 --> 41:43.834
I can't wait to hear you play.

41:43.835 --> 41:44.960
I've heard so much about you.

41:44.961 --> 41:46.294
Oh, that's good of
you to say, man.

41:46.295 --> 41:47.337
Thanks a lot.

41:47.338 --> 41:48.422
I can't wait to play,

41:48.423 --> 41:51.174
but I went and chopped
up my paw really good.

41:51.175 --> 41:52.175
Oh.

41:52.176 --> 41:53.885
Tony, you have to be
more careful next time.

41:53.886 --> 41:55.262
Yeah, okay.
You hear that?

41:55.263 --> 41:57.597
That is exactly the reason
why she gets along with my ma.

41:59.225 --> 42:00.225
Aw.

42:00.226 --> 42:01.226
Oh, my God!
What?

42:01.227 --> 42:02.853
I can't believe I
didn't think of this.

42:02.854 --> 42:03.854
Sam plays guitar.

42:03.855 --> 42:04.855
Seriously?
Yeah.

42:04.856 --> 42:05.856
No.

42:05.857 --> 42:07.149
Brother.

42:07.150 --> 42:08.150
Oh.
You're up.

42:08.151 --> 42:09.151
Oh, n--oh, well--

42:09.152 --> 42:10.152
He plays!

42:10.153 --> 42:11.153
No, no!
No, no, Tony.

42:11.154 --> 42:12.571
Would you? Come on.
Tony, honestly--

42:12.572 --> 42:13.947
I won't take "no" for an answer.

42:13.948 --> 42:15.516
Please, Tony.
Don't do this to me.

42:15.992 --> 42:17.659
Tony...
You guys ready?

42:17.660 --> 42:18.660
Brother, you ready?

42:18.661 --> 42:20.370
Yeah.
All right, Three, two-go.

42:20.371 --> 42:21.413
I got to tune this up.

42:21.414 --> 42:22.706
You know what?
I should tune.

42:22.707 --> 42:23.623
Sorry, guys.

42:23.624 --> 42:25.709
It's how this is--yeah.
Yeah.

42:25.710 --> 42:28.086
Is this--this is--

42:28.087 --> 42:29.546
You take your time, bro.

42:29.547 --> 42:31.048
You take your time, brother.

42:31.049 --> 42:32.257
I don't think--I'm not
really used to playing this.

42:32.258 --> 42:33.575
It's a--I'm a righty.

42:34.802 --> 42:36.094
He's good, right?

42:36.095 --> 42:38.388
I mean, he does this--yeah.

42:38.389 --> 42:39.431
Go ahead. Go ahead.

42:40.433 --> 42:42.392
Can you do it with him?

42:42.393 --> 42:44.728
Oh! What? I'm sorry.

42:44.729 --> 42:46.229
Popped-popped the old string.

42:46.230 --> 42:47.898
Sorry, guys.
It's all right, brother.

42:47.899 --> 42:49.066
Oh, sorry.

42:49.067 --> 42:50.567
I owe you a guitar.
You break things.

42:50.568 --> 42:51.568
Things break.

42:51.569 --> 42:52.819
They're objects.
It's all right.

42:52.820 --> 42:53.820
All right.
Thanks, brother.

42:53.821 --> 42:55.906
This one's gonna go out
for you.

42:55.907 --> 42:56.907
What was that?

42:56.908 --> 42:58.533
I just--it's too hard.
Too much.

42:58.534 --> 42:59.576
Don't worry about it.

43:16.344 --> 43:18.595
Birdie Hazel, ladies and gents!

43:18.596 --> 43:19.471

43:22.141 --> 43:23.141
No!

43:23.142 --> 43:24.559

44:30.334 --> 44:31.376
Nice to meet you.

44:31.377 --> 44:32.377
Birdie.
Yeah.

44:32.378 --> 44:33.461
I feel like I know you already.

44:33.462 --> 44:34.504
He won't stop talking about you.

44:34.505 --> 44:36.173
Oh, uh--oh.

44:36.174 --> 44:38.208
No, no.
Nothing like that.

44:39.093 --> 44:41.428
Oh, did you tell her about
the Sacred Spirit retreat?

44:41.429 --> 44:42.596
No, Eliot.

44:42.597 --> 44:44.347
You guys, you don't have to come.

44:44.348 --> 44:45.515
Sacred spirit? What? What?

44:45.516 --> 44:47.392
It's this--go ahead.

44:47.393 --> 44:48.852
Well, the next
one's only one night.

44:48.853 --> 44:51.188
It's sort of a nightly camp
to kind of gather your thoughts.

44:51.189 --> 44:52.772
It's a bunch of other people
out in nature,

44:52.773 --> 44:54.065
to refresh your spirit.

44:54.066 --> 44:56.151
That sounds awesome.

44:56.152 --> 44:58.153
That's, like, right up my alley.
Yeah.

44:58.154 --> 44:59.154
Yeah, it's cool.

44:59.155 --> 45:00.280
It's pretty cool.
I don't know, but--

45:00.281 --> 45:01.281
Do you--you want to go?

45:01.282 --> 45:02.282
Really?

45:02.283 --> 45:03.283
Yeah. I mean, really.

45:03.284 --> 45:04.451
Is that--would that be cool?

45:04.452 --> 45:05.410
Oh...
Absolutely.

45:05.411 --> 45:07.162
Yeah. Oh, my God.
Yeah. Please. Please.

45:07.163 --> 45:08.914
If that's okay,
that'd be great.

45:08.915 --> 45:10.123
Yeah.
That's great.

45:10.124 --> 45:11.124
Yes!

45:11.125 --> 45:12.125
Oh, great.
Oh, good.

45:12.126 --> 45:13.126
'Cause I wanted to go too, so...

45:13.127 --> 45:14.211
Okay, good.
Perfect. Perfect.

45:14.212 --> 45:15.212
Awesome.

45:15.213 --> 45:17.130
Well, it was nice
to meet you guys.

45:17.131 --> 45:18.715
Where's the nearest subway stop?

45:18.716 --> 45:19.716
Oh, I'll walk you--

45:19.717 --> 45:20.717
No, no. Forget it.

45:20.718 --> 45:21.718
Get in the car. It's too cold.

45:21.719 --> 45:22.719
Really?
Yeah. Sure.

45:22.720 --> 45:24.095
Oh, my God. That's so nice.

45:24.096 --> 45:25.889
Thank you.
Okay.

45:25.890 --> 45:28.016
All right.
Uh...

45:28.017 --> 45:29.809
Bye.
Bye.

45:32.063 --> 45:33.730
Hey. Here.
Oh, I--oh.

45:33.731 --> 45:35.265
I got it.

45:36.067 --> 45:37.234
Where am I going?
You really got it.

45:37.235 --> 45:39.236
Just... She seems great!

45:39.237 --> 45:41.101
She knows not
to say anything, right?

45:43.282 --> 45:44.407
Hey, El.

45:44.408 --> 45:46.284
Do you have a cool,
like, hippie-type shirt

45:46.285 --> 45:47.327
I could wear for the retreat?

45:47.328 --> 45:48.328
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

45:48.329 --> 45:49.663
Yep. Just give me a minute.
What are you doing?

45:49.664 --> 45:51.289
I'm just--
I'm looking at a magazine.

45:51.290 --> 45:52.624
Looking at a magazine?
We got to go!

45:52.625 --> 45:54.000
What magazine you looking at?

45:54.001 --> 45:55.543
Martha Stewart Living.

45:55.544 --> 45:56.544
Why...

45:56.545 --> 45:58.255
Oh, God.

45:58.256 --> 45:59.589
Martha Stewart?

45:59.590 --> 46:00.757
Really?

46:00.758 --> 46:02.842
Yeah, dude, you got to see
this Thanksgiving issue cover.

46:02.843 --> 46:03.885
It's insane.

46:03.886 --> 46:05.470
No, I'm good.

46:05.471 --> 46:07.084
Buddy, we got to go.

46:08.266 --> 46:09.266
All right.

46:09.267 --> 46:10.475
Thanks for killing the mood.

46:10.476 --> 46:11.476
Sorry.

46:11.477 --> 46:12.727
You pumped for the retreat?

46:12.728 --> 46:14.271
Pumped?
No.

46:14.272 --> 46:15.760
Um, do you--oh.

46:16.357 --> 46:17.357
Birdie'll love it.

46:17.358 --> 46:18.942
Do you think?

46:18.943 --> 46:20.026
Thanks.

47:17.877 --> 47:19.536

47:23.174 --> 47:25.008
Yeah, you know, I don't--

47:25.009 --> 47:27.677
I don't really smoke that much,
but what the hell?

47:27.678 --> 47:28.678
Yeah, me too.

47:28.679 --> 47:31.348
I'm not exactly the lead singer
of Phish either,

47:31.349 --> 47:34.505
but you know what they
say-- when at retreats...

47:35.394 --> 47:37.212
You're gonna--you sure?

47:38.481 --> 47:41.107
I'll light the old Christmas
tree whenever I get the urge.

47:42.651 --> 47:43.651
What?

47:43.652 --> 47:44.736
Christmas tree?

47:44.737 --> 47:45.904
What?

47:45.905 --> 47:47.072
S'mores for me.

47:47.073 --> 47:48.323
S'mores, Sam.

47:49.575 --> 47:51.076
Mm.

47:51.077 --> 47:52.702
So, Birdie,

47:52.703 --> 47:54.496
is that, like, a nickname,
or that's--

47:54.497 --> 47:55.997
God.

47:55.998 --> 47:57.707
No, my parents were hippies...
Mm-hmm.

47:57.708 --> 48:01.086
And they felt like the world
was caging in on us,

48:01.087 --> 48:05.048
so they wanted their little
girl to fly free, hence Birdie.

48:05.049 --> 48:07.550
Birdie.
That's so cool.

48:10.513 --> 48:11.921
Oh, no.

48:12.890 --> 48:13.890
Oh, no?

48:13.891 --> 48:15.266
What's wrong?

48:15.267 --> 48:18.978
Hey, it might be the
shrooms talking to the K,

48:18.979 --> 48:21.773
but don't you teach me guitar?

48:21.774 --> 48:23.358
No, that's the
shrooms talking to you.

48:23.359 --> 48:24.359
You teach me the guitar.

48:24.360 --> 48:25.777
No, no.

48:25.778 --> 48:27.237
Hey, is this the chick?

48:27.238 --> 48:28.238
No.

48:28.239 --> 48:30.281
Is this the little pussy?
Shut up. Shut up.

48:30.282 --> 48:31.282
Hey, guys, I'm gonna--

48:31.283 --> 48:33.410
I'm gonna go get
some s'mores, I think.

48:33.411 --> 48:34.452
Okay.

48:34.453 --> 48:36.246
You good?

48:36.247 --> 48:37.530
Where you going?

48:39.250 --> 48:40.909
Hello. Hi.
You want a s'more?

48:42.294 --> 48:43.837
Hello?

48:47.258 --> 48:49.300
What the fuck?

48:59.562 --> 49:00.895
Sam.
Huh?

49:00.896 --> 49:03.106
You okay?
Oh, no, I'm chillin'.

49:03.107 --> 49:04.107
Guys, come on.

49:04.108 --> 49:05.775
This mantra's
not gonna chant itself.

49:05.776 --> 49:07.193
Okay!

49:07.194 --> 49:08.194
Oh, Jesus.

49:08.195 --> 49:10.184
Your boyfriend is killing
me with this thing.

49:11.115 --> 49:12.490
I was doing so well too.

49:12.491 --> 49:14.492
It was happening.
It was flowing.

49:14.493 --> 49:15.660
Now I'm so stoned.

49:15.661 --> 49:16.953
I'm so fucked.

49:16.954 --> 49:18.442
I'm gonna be completely exposed.

49:19.540 --> 49:20.665
What are you doing?

49:20.666 --> 49:21.666
Huh?

49:21.667 --> 49:24.702
Oh, eating helps calm me down
when I'm stressed out.

49:25.296 --> 49:27.088
I have a medical condition.

49:27.089 --> 49:28.089
These are disgusting.

49:28.090 --> 49:31.426
No, what-- What are you
doing with the girl?

49:31.427 --> 49:32.469
What are you talking about?

49:32.470 --> 49:34.179
Completely exposed?

49:34.180 --> 49:36.347
Sam, it's a-- it's a little
dramatic, I think.

49:36.348 --> 49:37.348
Ash, look at her.

49:37.349 --> 49:39.058
Look at this place.
It's a perfect fit.

49:39.059 --> 49:40.059
I can't do this shit.

49:40.060 --> 49:41.060
It's not me.

49:41.061 --> 49:42.353
I don't know what I'm doing here.

49:42.354 --> 49:43.480
Such a mistake.

49:43.481 --> 49:45.064
It's called "compromise."

49:45.065 --> 49:47.650
Look, wine tasting isn't exactly

49:47.651 --> 49:49.444
Eliot's, like, favorite
thing in the world.

49:49.445 --> 49:50.320
But remember?

49:50.321 --> 49:52.405
He took me
to the Finger Lakes last summer.

49:52.406 --> 49:54.491
We had a really good time
'cause he knew it was something

49:54.492 --> 49:56.201
that I had always wanted to do.

49:56.202 --> 49:58.077
He showed me the pictures.
I know!

49:58.078 --> 50:00.413
And, look, I am not really into

50:00.414 --> 50:03.791
all this spiritual mumbo-jumbo...
Right?

50:03.792 --> 50:06.127
But I come on all these
retreats with him.

50:06.128 --> 50:07.504
Look, you don't have to love it.

50:07.505 --> 50:11.036
You just have to try it for
the sake of your partner.

50:12.259 --> 50:14.010
Right.

50:14.011 --> 50:15.845
You're right.

50:15.846 --> 50:17.013
Eyes on the prize, soldier.

50:17.014 --> 50:18.139
Okay.
Okay.

50:18.140 --> 50:19.224
Eyes on the prize.

50:19.225 --> 50:20.183
Here. Take a napkin.

50:20.184 --> 50:22.018
Uh, no. I'm good.

50:22.019 --> 50:31.277
Eyes on the prize.

50:31.278 --> 50:32.362
Both: Eyes on the prize.

50:32.363 --> 50:33.863
Eyes on the prize.

50:33.864 --> 50:34.864
Eyes on the prize.

50:34.865 --> 50:37.242
Eyes on the prize.

50:37.243 --> 50:39.232
Eyes on the prize.

50:40.412 --> 50:42.580
That's what I said now.

50:42.581 --> 50:44.866
I'm the one that loves you,
baby; can't you see?

50:46.001 --> 50:48.069
I'm the one that loves you,
baby; can't you see?

50:48.712 --> 50:51.839
I just-- just go ahead now.

50:51.840 --> 50:56.745
If you want to buy me flowers, just...
go ahead now.

50:58.472 --> 50:59.889
I wish I could say
that was the craziest thing

50:59.890 --> 51:02.141
that I've ever done just now.

51:02.142 --> 51:05.019
I-I can say that, easily.

51:05.020 --> 51:07.855
I-I can say that I've never
started a chant before.

51:07.856 --> 51:09.232
You had them going!

51:09.233 --> 51:10.233
They loved it.

51:10.234 --> 51:11.192
Yeah, that got--

51:11.193 --> 51:12.193
It was fun.

51:12.194 --> 51:13.432
It got intense.

51:15.030 --> 51:16.447
Okay.

51:16.448 --> 51:17.907
If you could go
anywhere in the world,

51:17.908 --> 51:19.284
where would you go?

51:19.285 --> 51:21.578
Orlando, definitely.

51:21.579 --> 51:22.870
I've always wanted
to go to Orlando

51:22.871 --> 51:24.289
or maybe one of the outlying
suburbs of Orlando.

51:26.250 --> 51:27.166
You know, I don't know.

51:27.167 --> 51:29.210
I haven't traveled
as much as I want to.

51:29.211 --> 51:30.628
I really want to travel.

51:30.629 --> 51:32.589
I've never even been
outside the States.

51:32.590 --> 51:33.590
Really?
Yeah.

51:33.591 --> 51:34.908
Oh, man.

51:36.385 --> 51:38.720
I'd love--I'd love to go to the
Galápagos islands, though.

51:38.721 --> 51:41.373
That's the--that's the place--
one place I'd want to go.

51:42.141 --> 51:43.683
That's so crazy.

51:43.684 --> 51:45.226
Why?

51:45.227 --> 51:49.397
That's, like, the one place
on Earth I don't want to go.

51:49.398 --> 51:51.107
Like, real--

51:51.108 --> 51:52.108
Are you kidding?

51:52.109 --> 51:53.776
No--well, okay.

51:53.777 --> 51:55.570
I love what it represents,

51:55.571 --> 51:57.864
and I-I'm in love with place, but...

51:57.865 --> 51:58.906
Yeah.

51:58.907 --> 52:00.992
I feel like by going there,

52:00.993 --> 52:03.620
it would be, like, the end
of what makes it what it is.

52:03.621 --> 52:04.621
You know?

52:04.622 --> 52:06.247
It's like this untouched part
of the world,

52:06.248 --> 52:08.666
and it's got
all these incredible animals

52:08.667 --> 52:09.917
that you can't find
anywhere else,

52:09.918 --> 52:11.836
and they're just roaming freely.

52:11.837 --> 52:12.837
Tortoises and...

52:12.838 --> 52:14.631
There's, like, this
natural perfection to it.

52:14.632 --> 52:17.675
Right, so that's-- What's wrong with that?
That sounds--

52:17.676 --> 52:18.718
That sounds great.

52:18.719 --> 52:21.512
Yeah, but I-I feel like
we'd find a way

52:21.513 --> 52:23.348
to fuck it up, you know?

52:23.349 --> 52:25.308
Selfishly, I'd love to go.

52:25.309 --> 52:27.268
I'd love to experience it.

52:27.269 --> 52:31.105
But if we got to go, then so
would bloated, pasty tourists

52:31.106 --> 52:32.982
who want an exotic honeymoon.

52:32.983 --> 52:34.025
No thanks.

52:37.154 --> 52:39.656
You know, that's-- that's exactly
how I feel about Orlando.

52:45.329 --> 52:46.329
Oh, my God.

52:46.330 --> 52:47.997
My parents would love this.

52:47.998 --> 52:49.207
Oh, really?
Yeah.

52:49.208 --> 52:52.335
They must be, like,
super hippies.

52:52.336 --> 52:53.544
Let me just put it this way:

52:53.545 --> 52:56.464
in college, they had a band
called Hemp Hemp Hooray.

52:56.465 --> 52:57.507
What?

52:57.508 --> 52:59.008
That's--that's amazing.

52:59.009 --> 53:00.718
Yeah.

53:00.719 --> 53:02.220
Where do they live?

53:02.221 --> 53:06.224
They live in Oregon growing
God-knows-what on their farm.

53:08.227 --> 53:09.886
What about you?
What about your parents?

53:10.729 --> 53:12.355
My dad's fine.

53:12.356 --> 53:17.276
He's up in Vermont,
living the quiet life.

53:17.277 --> 53:21.364
He's a retired-- retired
columnist, very heady.

53:21.365 --> 53:22.532
Nice.

53:22.533 --> 53:23.783
Yeah.

53:23.784 --> 53:25.397
What about your mom?
Where's your mom?

53:27.204 --> 53:32.125
My mom and I had sort of, um--

53:32.126 --> 53:34.240
sort of an up-and-down
relationship.

53:34.545 --> 53:37.463
Mostly down, I guess.

53:37.464 --> 53:42.760
She left my dad for someone
else who she thought was better

53:42.761 --> 53:47.423
and kind of stopped
talking to me in the process.

53:47.558 --> 53:51.006
Just sort of-- sort
of cut us off.

53:55.274 --> 53:58.935
So you guys don't talk
at all anymore?

53:59.945 --> 54:00.987
Um, no.

54:00.988 --> 54:05.742
I... I got a card in the
mail about three years ago.

54:05.743 --> 54:09.859
No, four, actually, now.

54:10.164 --> 54:11.581
God.

54:11.582 --> 54:14.167
Yeah, it was from
her new husband,

54:14.168 --> 54:17.787
and it just said that
she'd-- she'd passed away.

54:19.757 --> 54:21.382
But, you know, we hadn't
talked in, like, five years,

54:21.383 --> 54:25.762
so it was-- it was--it
was actually--

54:25.763 --> 54:28.298
it wasn't as bad
as it could have been.

54:31.059 --> 54:34.604
I-I'm--I... I kind of hate
talking about this stuff.

54:34.605 --> 54:37.607
Yeah, no. Um... We don't
have to talk about it.

54:37.608 --> 54:38.800
I'm...

54:39.777 --> 54:40.777
I'm so sorry.

54:40.778 --> 54:42.095
No, no.
It's okay.

54:42.946 --> 54:44.405
It's all right.
I'm just--I'm--

54:44.406 --> 54:47.817
I'm just stoned, and it's a lot.

54:50.788 --> 54:53.073
I love this stuff, though, you know?

54:56.460 --> 54:58.920
I think we are who we are
when we're with the people

54:58.921 --> 55:00.830
that make us feel the most alive.

55:03.175 --> 55:05.494
I don't know.
I feel very alive right now.

55:12.309 --> 55:13.501
I-I can't--

55:14.436 --> 55:15.770
I can't decide which is better--

55:15.771 --> 55:19.148
the fact that it's minus
20 degrees out

55:19.149 --> 55:22.819
or the millions of twigs jabbing
me in the ass right now.

55:24.321 --> 55:25.321
I know.

55:25.322 --> 55:26.656
I have, like, a root jabbing me.

55:27.991 --> 55:29.408
I'll jab you with a root.

55:29.409 --> 55:31.369
Sorry.

55:31.370 --> 55:32.787
That's--that's too bad,

55:32.788 --> 55:36.249
'cause I really love dirty
nature double entendres.

55:36.250 --> 55:38.084
Oh, yeah?
Mm-hmm.

55:38.085 --> 55:39.502
Try saying that ten times fast.

55:39.503 --> 55:43.214
Dirty nature double entendres.

55:43.215 --> 55:45.033
It can't be done.
It's impossible.

55:51.181 --> 55:53.224
Dirty...

55:53.225 --> 55:55.017
nature...

55:55.018 --> 55:57.520
double...

55:57.521 --> 55:58.838
entendres.

56:07.781 --> 56:10.408
I think I can feel that root
you were talking about.

56:10.409 --> 56:11.701
Oh, dear.
It's growing.

56:24.715 --> 56:26.549
Really?

56:26.550 --> 56:28.384
Hey.
Hey.

56:28.385 --> 56:30.136
I think--
I think we're good to go.

56:30.137 --> 56:31.420
Yeah. Good.

56:40.439 --> 56:44.926
Hey, um... I got to go help El
with the rest of the stuff.

56:45.694 --> 56:47.728
Okay.

57:00.626 --> 57:02.585
I told her about
my mother last night.

57:02.586 --> 57:03.920
Such an idiot.

57:03.921 --> 57:06.505
Guarantee she's putting
the pieces together.

57:06.506 --> 57:07.882
I don't know.
She seems down.

57:07.883 --> 57:08.883
Yeah.

57:08.884 --> 57:10.968
El, she's down with the fake me.

57:10.969 --> 57:12.929
It's fucking stupid.

57:12.930 --> 57:14.543
I should never have done this.

57:16.183 --> 57:17.183
Well, I don't know.

57:17.184 --> 57:18.225
I think you're pretty awesome.

57:18.226 --> 57:20.878
You just seem--
I don't know. Mm.

57:21.939 --> 57:23.507
You just need to--

57:24.566 --> 57:26.680
to be totally honest
with you right now...

57:28.779 --> 57:29.971
Yeah?

57:33.617 --> 57:34.809
What?

57:37.079 --> 57:38.692
Are you driving?

57:39.331 --> 57:42.792
Not at the moment,
but I was about to.

57:42.793 --> 57:44.031
Give me the keys.

58:10.570 --> 58:11.570
Hello?

58:11.571 --> 58:12.780
Hey, I love it, my man.

58:12.781 --> 58:14.365
I love where this thing is going.

58:14.366 --> 58:16.158
You do?
Yeah.

58:16.159 --> 58:18.023
That's--that's great.

58:19.329 --> 58:21.706
I'm I'm I'm really
glad you're into it.

58:21.707 --> 58:22.707
I'm more than into it.

58:22.708 --> 58:24.166
You got my elegant wife

58:24.167 --> 58:25.668
and this pack of
whores she runs with

58:25.669 --> 58:26.919
cunt-bumping over this thing.

58:26.920 --> 58:29.005
Oh, that's awful.

58:29.006 --> 58:30.339
Yeah, trust me, no one's
ever gonna call you

58:30.340 --> 58:31.340
a hack writer again.

58:31.341 --> 58:32.842
Okay, wait.
Alan, who keeps--

58:32.843 --> 58:33.926
Sorry.
I got another call coming in.

58:33.927 --> 58:35.052
I have to jump, okay?

58:35.053 --> 58:37.013
I love you.

58:37.014 --> 58:38.097
Okay.

58:38.098 --> 58:39.348
Love you too.

58:39.349 --> 58:42.214
Bobby.
What have you got for me, Al?

58:43.145 --> 58:44.645
Was that Birdie?

58:44.646 --> 58:46.689
What? Uh, no.

58:46.690 --> 58:47.773
It was Alan.

58:47.774 --> 58:49.108
Oh.

58:49.109 --> 58:51.485
You got to help me come up
with a date for Birdie.

58:51.486 --> 58:53.112
I've gone through
everything on the page.

58:53.113 --> 58:54.647
She hasn't updated it in weeks.

58:55.407 --> 58:56.574
I need something.

58:56.575 --> 58:57.783
So why don't you go somewhere

58:57.784 --> 58:59.368
where you want to go
for a change,

58:59.369 --> 59:01.120
you know, something
from your profile?

59:01.121 --> 59:02.872
Yeah, but it's got to
be up her alley.

59:02.873 --> 59:04.957
You're up her alley, douche.

59:04.958 --> 59:08.044
Well, how about the-- that
prop shop place you love?

59:08.045 --> 59:09.045
Go there on a date?

59:09.046 --> 59:10.296
What would we do?

59:10.297 --> 59:13.716
Uh, shop, talk, not be obsessed
with being someone else.

59:13.717 --> 59:14.717
I don't know.

59:14.718 --> 59:15.885
I have no idea if she'd be
into that kind of stuff.

59:15.886 --> 59:18.125
It seems incredibly risky.

59:19.264 --> 59:20.639
Oh, man.

59:20.640 --> 59:22.424
Nope. Got to stick to the plan.

59:23.226 --> 59:24.919
Ooh!
Oh, boy.

59:25.896 --> 59:27.229
It's all coming back to you, right?

59:27.230 --> 59:28.522
Oh, yeah.

59:28.523 --> 59:29.931
It's like riding a bike...

59:31.276 --> 59:33.611
A really steep, difficult bike.

59:36.239 --> 59:37.431
Oh, Jesus.

59:38.617 --> 59:42.078

59:42.079 --> 59:45.414

59:53.840 --> 59:56.592
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

Why?

01:00:38.635 --> 01:00:40.043
Ah!

01:00:55.652 --> 01:00:57.095
Nosy parker.

01:00:58.280 --> 01:00:59.518
Sorry.

01:01:00.782 --> 01:01:01.949
I'm sorry it's raining.

01:01:01.950 --> 01:01:02.992
Well, it's okay.

01:01:02.993 --> 01:01:04.368
It's not entirely your fault.

01:01:04.369 --> 01:01:05.686
Heh. Yeah.

01:01:06.872 --> 01:01:07.872
I'm excited, though.

01:01:07.873 --> 01:01:09.498
This seems really cool.

01:01:09.499 --> 01:01:11.834
Well, don't get too excited.

01:01:11.835 --> 01:01:15.989
I mean, I like it, but, you
know, to each his own.

01:01:18.425 --> 01:01:19.884
So they--they're props from all--

01:01:19.885 --> 01:01:21.010
these are all props from movies.

01:01:21.011 --> 01:01:22.803
They keep them here.
This is so cool.

01:01:22.804 --> 01:01:24.138
I love it.
I feel like a kid in here.

01:01:24.139 --> 01:01:25.181
I just want to play
with everything.

01:01:25.182 --> 01:01:27.046
Right?
That's the point, and you can.

01:01:27.893 --> 01:01:28.893
Yes.

01:01:28.894 --> 01:01:30.352
I'm gonna wear this
to the Kentucky Derby.

01:01:30.353 --> 01:01:31.687
It's--I don't know if you're
even doing a joke,

01:01:31.688 --> 01:01:33.647
'cause it's--it's actually nice on you.

01:01:33.648 --> 01:01:35.232
I'm gonna wear this to something.

01:01:36.818 --> 01:01:38.652
Oh, my God, look.

01:01:38.653 --> 01:01:39.653
This is perfect.
Oh, my God.

01:01:39.654 --> 01:01:40.905
Look. Yes.

01:01:40.906 --> 01:01:41.906
Oh.

01:01:41.907 --> 01:01:43.532
That's so good.

01:01:43.533 --> 01:01:45.271
Ah, it brings me back.

01:01:45.827 --> 01:01:47.620
It's crazy.

01:01:47.621 --> 01:01:48.954
It brings you back?

01:01:48.955 --> 01:01:51.165
To what?

01:01:51.166 --> 01:01:53.209
Your tour of duty in Iwo Jima?

01:01:53.210 --> 01:01:55.278
Yeah.

01:01:56.379 --> 01:01:57.546
No, what does it
remind you of, though?

01:01:57.547 --> 01:01:58.547
Seriously.

01:01:58.548 --> 01:01:59.715
Oh...

01:01:59.716 --> 01:02:00.716
Nothing.
I--nothing.

01:02:00.717 --> 01:02:02.218
Oh, come on. I want to know.
No, no, I was just--

01:02:02.219 --> 01:02:04.220
It's not even like
I'm, like, holding out

01:02:04.221 --> 01:02:05.638
with some great thing.

01:02:05.639 --> 01:02:07.097
Okay, so tell me.
It's not a big deal.

01:02:07.098 --> 01:02:09.391
I was--I was in the Boy Scouts.

01:02:09.392 --> 01:02:10.768
I was a Boy Scout.

01:02:10.769 --> 01:02:12.895
Ah, that's so cute.

01:02:12.896 --> 01:02:14.438
Oh, God, why wouldn't you want
to tell me that?

01:02:14.439 --> 01:02:15.439
That's adorable!

01:02:15.440 --> 01:02:16.440
Ah.

01:02:16.441 --> 01:02:19.068
Did your parents
make you do it as a kid?

01:02:19.069 --> 01:02:20.069
Sort of.

01:02:20.070 --> 01:02:22.655
You know, you can--
People don't know this,

01:02:22.656 --> 01:02:24.448
but you can be in the Boy Scouts
till you're 18.

01:02:24.449 --> 01:02:26.116
It's not just, like, little--

01:02:26.117 --> 01:02:29.078
Were you in the Boy Scouts
till you were 18?

01:02:29.079 --> 01:02:32.998
Yeah. I wasn't as into-- I was
really more into it-- I know.

01:02:32.999 --> 01:02:34.124
See, it's not cute.

01:02:34.125 --> 01:02:35.125
No, it's so good.

01:02:35.126 --> 01:02:36.377
Wait, please tell me
you still have the uniform.

01:02:36.378 --> 01:02:37.378
Well, yeah.

01:02:37.379 --> 01:02:38.379
Sadly, I think it probably fits me.

01:02:38.380 --> 01:02:39.588
Okay, well, you're gonna
have to wear this

01:02:39.589 --> 01:02:40.827
for me at some point,

01:02:40.924 --> 01:02:43.092
because I actually find that
really sexy.

01:02:43.093 --> 01:02:44.260
You do?
I do.

01:02:44.261 --> 01:02:46.220
It's weird,
but I'm I'm serious.

01:02:46.221 --> 01:02:47.221
Really?

01:02:47.222 --> 01:02:50.432
Everyone's allowed, like, a
nerdy skeleton in their closet.

01:02:50.433 --> 01:02:52.851
Oh, yeah?
Well, just one?

01:02:52.852 --> 01:02:54.645
Actually, no.

01:02:54.646 --> 01:02:57.064
You're allowed a whole
closetful of nerd skeletons.

01:02:57.065 --> 01:02:58.565
Well, I would--I would--

01:02:58.566 --> 01:03:01.277
I would need an industrial-sized
walk-in closet, then...

01:03:01.278 --> 01:03:02.278
Oh, really?

01:03:02.279 --> 01:03:04.071
For all my nerdy skeletons.

01:03:04.072 --> 01:03:06.282
Give me another--
give me another example, then.

01:03:06.283 --> 01:03:08.242
No.
A really nerdy one.

01:03:08.243 --> 01:03:11.036
I mean, there are just so many.

01:03:11.037 --> 01:03:12.496
No, I'm serious, really.

01:03:12.497 --> 01:03:13.914
Just one more.

01:03:13.915 --> 01:03:16.125
I feel like one nerdy
skeleton a day revealed is--

01:03:16.126 --> 01:03:18.002
No.
No, I definitely--

01:03:18.003 --> 01:03:19.378
The nerdier, the sexier.

01:03:19.379 --> 01:03:20.504
You know that, right?

01:03:20.505 --> 01:03:22.256
Okay.

01:03:22.257 --> 01:03:23.995
Well, in that case, uh...

01:03:24.968 --> 01:03:26.885
I was in a band.

01:03:26.886 --> 01:03:28.679
That's not that nerdy.
That's cool.

01:03:28.680 --> 01:03:31.432
Well... Unless you're, like,
a New Kid on the Block.

01:03:31.433 --> 01:03:33.434
Yeah, exactly, yeah.

01:03:33.435 --> 01:03:34.852
I was the-- I was the
lost Wahlberg brother.

01:03:34.853 --> 01:03:36.103
I knew it!

01:03:36.104 --> 01:03:37.104
I'm Wally Wahlberg.

01:03:37.105 --> 01:03:38.439
You look so much alike.

01:03:38.440 --> 01:03:40.524
Right?
I get that all the time.

01:03:40.525 --> 01:03:42.138
Mostly in the ab region.

01:03:42.944 --> 01:03:43.944
No, really, what did you do?

01:03:43.945 --> 01:03:45.029
Did you play guitar
or something?

01:03:45.030 --> 01:03:47.072
Uh...

01:03:47.073 --> 01:03:48.657
Oh, man.

01:03:48.658 --> 01:03:49.658
What'd you do?

01:03:49.659 --> 01:03:52.578
I... I did bass.

01:03:52.579 --> 01:03:53.579
You did bass?

01:03:53.580 --> 01:03:55.622
Mm-hmm.

01:03:55.623 --> 01:03:57.791
That's either an expression
I've never heard,

01:03:57.792 --> 01:03:58.959
or something's going on here.

01:03:58.960 --> 01:04:00.461
Well, I--yeah, I mean,

01:04:00.462 --> 01:04:03.213
if you consider the voice
an instrument, I played.

01:04:03.214 --> 01:04:06.284
Were there any actual
instruments in this band?

01:04:07.969 --> 01:04:08.969
No, ma'am.

01:04:08.970 --> 01:04:10.471
This is an a cappella group, isn't it?

01:04:10.472 --> 01:04:11.472
Nope.

01:04:11.473 --> 01:04:12.765
You were in an a cappella group.

01:04:12.766 --> 01:04:14.183
In an a cappella band, yes.

01:04:14.184 --> 01:04:15.976
I was in an a cappella band.

01:04:15.977 --> 01:04:18.187
I can't believe you were
in an a cappella group,

01:04:18.188 --> 01:04:19.188
and you didn't tell me.

01:04:19.189 --> 01:04:20.439
Well, why--

01:04:20.440 --> 01:04:21.523
Why would I tell you that?

01:04:21.524 --> 01:04:24.264
Because it's awesome,
and we could have harmonized.

01:04:25.070 --> 01:04:27.559
This is--is not so awesome.

01:04:28.531 --> 01:04:30.949
There were as many women
in this band

01:04:30.950 --> 01:04:32.576
as there were instruments.

01:04:32.577 --> 01:04:33.577
That's the--

01:04:33.578 --> 01:04:34.578
This was an all-male a cappella group?

01:04:34.579 --> 01:04:35.746
It was an all-male a cappella group.

01:04:35.747 --> 01:04:36.747
Oh, my God.

01:04:36.748 --> 01:04:37.790
Yes, ma'am.

01:04:37.791 --> 01:04:40.793
It was a man band, so
get it--get it straight.

01:04:40.794 --> 01:04:44.213
Oh, there's nothing straight about it.

01:04:49.803 --> 01:04:51.792
<i>♪ It's my first time ♪</i>

01:04:57.727 --> 01:04:59.311
I'm so disgusted right now.

01:04:59.312 --> 01:05:02.147
I can't even-- I'm out of here.

01:05:02.148 --> 01:05:04.483
Go fuck yourself, Eliot!

01:05:07.070 --> 01:05:08.153
What was that?

01:05:08.154 --> 01:05:09.321
She saw all of it, man.

01:05:09.322 --> 01:05:12.241
Jamie Lee Curtis, Kathleen
Turner, Christie Brinkley.

01:05:12.242 --> 01:05:14.618
Fuck Wait. Kathleen Turner?

01:05:14.619 --> 01:05:15.786
Really?

01:05:15.787 --> 01:05:17.037
Dude...

01:05:17.038 --> 01:05:18.914
I'm sorry.

01:05:18.915 --> 01:05:20.528
Wait. Hold on.
Hold on.

01:05:21.793 --> 01:05:23.452
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.

01:05:24.963 --> 01:05:26.839
Are you okay?

01:05:26.840 --> 01:05:29.258
She gave me an ultimatum.

01:05:30.718 --> 01:05:34.096
Either the file goes or
she goes, so she went.

01:05:34.097 --> 01:05:35.973
Wait a second.

01:05:35.974 --> 01:05:37.474
You're talking about
a bunch of photos

01:05:37.475 --> 01:05:39.935
of old celebrities that you jerk
off to and your girlfriend,

01:05:39.936 --> 01:05:40.936
and you picked the photos?

01:05:40.937 --> 01:05:42.229
Just because I'm keeping the file

01:05:42.230 --> 01:05:43.689
doesn't mean that I love her any less.

01:05:43.690 --> 01:05:45.774
Why not just do whatever
makes her happy?

01:05:45.775 --> 01:05:46.775
Or if you got to keep 'em,

01:05:46.776 --> 01:05:48.777
just lie to her and say
you threw them out.

01:05:48.778 --> 01:05:50.362
It's not just about
the stupid fucking pictures!

01:05:50.363 --> 01:05:52.448
I don't even... I don't care.

01:05:52.449 --> 01:05:56.535
It's just how much of myself,
of what makes me who I am,

01:05:56.536 --> 01:05:59.981
can I just erase or--
or throw out?

01:06:00.915 --> 01:06:02.858
Fuck it.
I'm sorry for waking you up.

01:06:03.334 --> 01:06:04.777
It's okay.

01:06:09.382 --> 01:06:11.967
So I have a surprise
for the recital next Friday.

01:06:11.968 --> 01:06:12.968
Oh, yeah?
Yep.

01:06:12.969 --> 01:06:14.303
You're full of surprises.

01:06:14.304 --> 01:06:16.430
My parents are coming.
Whoa.

01:06:16.431 --> 01:06:18.223
Yeah.
That's crazy.

01:06:18.224 --> 01:06:19.224
They're really nice.

01:06:19.225 --> 01:06:21.226
They're really mellow, so
it's no pressure at all.

01:06:21.227 --> 01:06:22.227
Okay.

01:06:34.741 --> 01:06:39.077
Do you, um-- Do you want to
come upstairs for a nightcap?

01:06:39.078 --> 01:06:41.163
A nightcap?

01:06:41.164 --> 01:06:42.372
What year is this?

01:06:42.373 --> 01:06:43.373
Shut up.

01:06:43.374 --> 01:06:44.541
I assumed that you knew

01:06:44.542 --> 01:06:47.669
that "nightcap" is a
euphemism for sexy time.

01:06:47.670 --> 01:06:49.338
Ah, no. No.

01:06:49.339 --> 01:06:50.881
I never heard that.

01:06:50.882 --> 01:06:55.010
I'd love to come up
and nightcap you,

01:06:55.011 --> 01:06:58.514
but I don't think the Indian
food and the dance moves

01:06:58.515 --> 01:07:00.599
are really joining
in perfect harmony.

01:07:00.600 --> 01:07:02.017
I'm so sorry.

01:07:02.018 --> 01:07:02.976
It's okay.

01:07:02.977 --> 01:07:04.228
Oh.

01:07:04.229 --> 01:07:05.229
Well, s--yeah.

01:07:05.230 --> 01:07:07.981
Just get some rest and call
me if you need anything.

01:07:07.982 --> 01:07:09.390
I will. I will.

01:07:10.443 --> 01:07:11.681
You don't look good.

01:07:12.987 --> 01:07:14.225
I'll be okay.

01:07:15.532 --> 01:07:16.698
Well, tonight was really nice.

01:07:16.699 --> 01:07:18.233
Yeah.

01:07:21.079 --> 01:07:23.872
"I have learned that to be
with those I like is enough."

01:07:27.835 --> 01:07:30.120
It's--it's Walt Whitman.

01:07:31.339 --> 01:07:32.577
Yeah, I know.

01:07:35.218 --> 01:07:36.581
What?

01:07:37.762 --> 01:07:39.846
Nothing.

01:07:39.847 --> 01:07:41.098
No, what?

01:07:41.099 --> 01:07:42.337
Uh...

01:07:43.935 --> 01:07:45.423
I think, um...

01:07:47.772 --> 01:07:51.012
I think I'm falling in love with you.

01:07:55.530 --> 01:07:59.100
Birdie, you're-- you're amazing.

01:08:19.636 --> 01:08:20.920
Good night.

01:08:24.100 --> 01:08:25.417
Good night.

01:08:38.781 --> 01:08:39.781
Holy shit.

01:08:39.782 --> 01:08:41.116
She said she loved me.

01:08:41.117 --> 01:08:42.492
Can you believe that?

01:08:42.493 --> 01:08:44.411
How could she possibly
say that and mean it?

01:08:44.412 --> 01:08:45.828
She loves me?

01:08:45.830 --> 01:08:48.149
And she wants me to meet
her parents on Friday.

01:08:48.707 --> 01:08:51.877
El, she doesn't even
know me, this girl.

01:08:51.877 --> 01:08:52.877
Oh, man.

01:08:52.879 --> 01:08:54.587
I am--I am eating ice cream
in the middle of winter.

01:08:54.589 --> 01:08:56.214
I'm quoting Whitman randomly.

01:08:56.215 --> 01:08:57.424
If she thinks this is who I am,

01:08:57.425 --> 01:08:58.716
she's in for a rude awakening.

01:08:58.718 --> 01:09:00.176
That's all I can say.

01:09:00.178 --> 01:09:01.595
I, uh-- I got to write a little bit,

01:09:01.595 --> 01:09:03.460
but if you need me,
I'll be in my room.

01:09:05.350 --> 01:09:06.433
Oh, how am I doing?

01:09:06.434 --> 01:09:08.644
Oh, thanks so much for asking.

01:09:23.910 --> 01:09:25.193
Oh.

01:09:28.456 --> 01:09:29.456
Hello?

01:09:29.457 --> 01:09:30.624
Morning, sunshine.

01:09:30.625 --> 01:09:31.625
Alan, hey.

01:09:31.626 --> 01:09:32.626
What time is it?

01:09:32.627 --> 01:09:34.044
Listen, it's early,
but I couldn't wait.

01:09:34.045 --> 01:09:35.087
I got those pages you
emailed me last night.

01:09:35.087 --> 01:09:36.296
Oh. yeah?

01:09:36.296 --> 01:09:37.296
You like?

01:09:37.298 --> 01:09:38.465
I likey very much.

01:09:38.466 --> 01:09:39.800
I likey long time.

01:09:39.801 --> 01:09:40.801
That's why I'm calling.

01:09:40.801 --> 01:09:42.636
I'm calling to see if we
can get a pitch session

01:09:42.636 --> 01:09:44.845
set together to come up
with the ending

01:09:44.846 --> 01:09:46.848
and go over some ideas for it.

01:09:46.849 --> 01:09:48.350
Let's say next Friday at 6:00.

01:09:48.350 --> 01:09:50.685
Oh, uh, actually, you know, I--

01:09:50.687 --> 01:09:52.479
I got this dance recital thing.

01:09:53.481 --> 01:09:54.481
That's a good one.

01:09:54.482 --> 01:09:56.983
But seriously, how's Friday
gonna be, next Friday?

01:09:56.984 --> 01:09:58.860
Uh, yeah, sure.

01:09:58.861 --> 01:09:59.861
That'll work.

01:09:59.862 --> 01:10:01.655
All right, it's on.
I'm excited.

01:10:01.656 --> 01:10:03.031
That's great.
So what are you doing tonight?

01:10:03.032 --> 01:10:04.032
I'd like to get my guy a beer.

01:10:04.033 --> 01:10:05.200
You know, Alan, I can't.

01:10:05.201 --> 01:10:06.535
My...

01:10:06.536 --> 01:10:08.704
This girl I've been seeing,

01:10:08.705 --> 01:10:10.539
she's got this surprise
planned for us.

01:10:10.540 --> 01:10:12.249
All right.
Listen, I got to go.

01:10:12.250 --> 01:10:13.375
I got to get back to writing.

01:10:13.376 --> 01:10:14.376
But I'll see you next Friday.

01:10:14.377 --> 01:10:16.169
Okay. I'm psyched up.
I love you, pal.

01:10:16.170 --> 01:10:18.046
I love you too.

01:10:18.047 --> 01:10:19.631
Triple Xs, triple Os.

01:10:19.632 --> 01:10:21.416
You too.

01:10:31.394 --> 01:10:32.728
I'm so excited.

01:10:32.729 --> 01:10:33.729
Me too.

01:10:33.730 --> 01:10:34.896
All right.
I'm nervous.

01:10:34.897 --> 01:10:37.065
Now, you have to close
your eyes

01:10:37.066 --> 01:10:38.275
till I tell you to open them.

01:10:38.276 --> 01:10:39.484
Really?
Yeah.

01:10:39.485 --> 01:10:40.569
Okay.

01:10:40.570 --> 01:10:41.570
I might need some help.

01:10:41.571 --> 01:10:42.571
Yeah. I'll lead you.

01:10:42.572 --> 01:10:43.572
Okay. Sorry.

01:10:43.573 --> 01:10:44.573
All righty.

01:10:44.574 --> 01:10:46.187
Here we go.
Walk straight.

01:10:48.953 --> 01:10:50.078
Okay.

01:10:50.079 --> 01:10:51.580
'Kay.

01:10:51.581 --> 01:10:52.914
All right. Open 'em.

01:10:52.915 --> 01:10:54.107
'Kay.

01:10:55.168 --> 01:10:56.168
Wow.

01:10:56.169 --> 01:10:57.169
Isn't this awesome?
Ha!

01:10:57.170 --> 01:10:58.754
My friend works here.

01:10:58.755 --> 01:11:01.590
Had to promise my first--born
child to get the keys,

01:11:01.591 --> 01:11:03.534
but what do you think?

01:11:05.178 --> 01:11:06.386
Those are Andrew Wyeths.

01:11:06.387 --> 01:11:07.387
I know.

01:11:07.388 --> 01:11:08.930
He's my favorite artist.

01:11:08.931 --> 01:11:10.599
Yeah, I know.

01:11:10.600 --> 01:11:12.134
Really?
Yeah.

01:11:13.603 --> 01:11:14.770
You know who mine is?

01:11:14.771 --> 01:11:16.521
No.

01:11:16.522 --> 01:11:17.856
I don't have one.

01:11:22.403 --> 01:11:25.572
Uh... Do you want some bourbon?

01:11:25.573 --> 01:11:27.574
No, I'm good.

01:11:27.575 --> 01:11:28.983
Really? Just a toast?

01:11:29.285 --> 01:11:30.327
To what?

01:11:30.328 --> 01:11:32.738
I don't know.
To us.

01:11:34.457 --> 01:11:36.541
Do you have anything
besides bourbon?

01:11:36.542 --> 01:11:37.542
No, no.

01:11:37.543 --> 01:11:38.960
This is all I have.

01:11:38.961 --> 01:11:40.045
Ah.

01:11:40.046 --> 01:11:41.864
Yeah, no.
I'm good.

01:11:44.467 --> 01:11:45.659
That's crazy.

01:11:46.552 --> 01:11:48.996
My mom used to wear her hair
in braids just like this.

01:11:54.101 --> 01:11:56.715
They call these the, uh--
the Helga paintings.

01:11:57.980 --> 01:11:59.815
Andrew's wife walked
into his studio one day

01:11:59.816 --> 01:12:03.853
and found, like, 240 paintings
of this other woman.

01:12:04.904 --> 01:12:07.518
Turns out it was their
next-door neighbor Helga.

01:12:08.282 --> 01:12:10.601
Well, life's a bitch.

01:12:13.579 --> 01:12:15.397
God, I wish I could paint like that.

01:12:16.541 --> 01:12:18.500
I bet you could.

01:12:18.501 --> 01:12:19.584
You're so talented.

01:12:19.585 --> 01:12:21.028
Oh, okay.

01:12:24.799 --> 01:12:26.383
Are you, uh--are you hungry?

01:12:26.384 --> 01:12:27.759
You want some food?

01:12:27.760 --> 01:12:29.203
I just ate.
It's okay.

01:12:33.516 --> 01:12:35.084
Sam, what's going on?

01:12:38.187 --> 01:12:39.396
What do you mean?

01:12:39.397 --> 01:12:41.886
Do you want to be
here right now?

01:12:43.025 --> 01:12:44.693
What are you talking about?

01:12:44.694 --> 01:12:47.487
Okay, I'm--
I'm just starting to feel

01:12:47.488 --> 01:12:49.114
like some annoying
girl you just met

01:12:49.115 --> 01:12:50.808
that you're trying to get rid of.

01:12:52.827 --> 01:12:56.204
I-I-I have a lot of shit
on my mind, is all.

01:12:56.205 --> 01:12:58.569
But I'm making a lot of headway
with my writing.

01:12:59.208 --> 01:13:01.126
Really good stuff.

01:13:01.127 --> 01:13:02.210
That Teen Vampire 2?

01:13:04.797 --> 01:13:05.797
Is that what you think?

01:13:05.798 --> 01:13:08.300
You think--you think
I'm a hack writer, don't you?

01:13:08.301 --> 01:13:09.801
No.

01:13:09.802 --> 01:13:11.210
No, no. God.

01:13:11.888 --> 01:13:13.126
No, that's not what I meant.

01:13:13.890 --> 01:13:15.207
It's all right.
I get it.

01:13:18.311 --> 01:13:21.396
You know, I-- I kind of
prefer this to the Wyeths.

01:13:21.397 --> 01:13:25.317
Is this because
I-I told you that I--

01:13:25.318 --> 01:13:27.569
you know, about what I
said the other night?

01:13:27.570 --> 01:13:28.570
Come on.

01:13:28.571 --> 01:13:30.196
I see what's going on here.

01:13:30.197 --> 01:13:33.408
It's a little weird, don't you think?

01:13:33.409 --> 01:13:34.910
I mean, you invite me
to this private viewing

01:13:34.911 --> 01:13:36.661
of your favorite artist's paintings

01:13:36.662 --> 01:13:37.913
with your favorite liquor

01:13:37.914 --> 01:13:39.789
and your favorite bread
and your favorite cheese.

01:13:39.790 --> 01:13:41.750
If you're not into it,
we don't have to--

01:13:41.751 --> 01:13:42.751
No, no, no.

01:13:42.752 --> 01:13:43.752
I get it, okay?

01:13:43.753 --> 01:13:46.630
I'm--I'm meat loaf, and you
want fucking filet mignon.

01:13:46.631 --> 01:13:48.173
What are you even
talking about?

01:13:48.174 --> 01:13:50.300
I'm exhausted!

01:13:50.301 --> 01:13:52.594
The rock climbing, the guitar,
and the cooking--

01:13:52.595 --> 01:13:53.678
The cooking?

01:13:53.679 --> 01:13:55.138
I'm just trying to keep up
with you, Birdie,

01:13:55.139 --> 01:13:56.139
and it's not easy.

01:13:56.140 --> 01:13:57.140
Okay, no.

01:13:57.141 --> 01:13:58.516
I don't want you
to keep up with me, okay?

01:13:58.517 --> 01:13:59.726
That--none of that stuffs
important to me.

01:13:59.727 --> 01:14:00.727
Can I tell you something?

01:14:00.728 --> 01:14:02.270
Honestly, I think you're better
off with someone else.

01:14:02.271 --> 01:14:05.774
Like Tony--
outgoing, talented, worldly.

01:14:05.775 --> 01:14:06.942
He's--he's perfect for you.

01:14:06.943 --> 01:14:08.693
What? No.

01:14:08.694 --> 01:14:10.362
Tony is my friend, okay?

01:14:10.363 --> 01:14:12.697
Dating the guy was
a complete nightmare.

01:14:12.698 --> 01:14:14.240
You're being ridiculous.

01:14:14.241 --> 01:14:15.450
Am I really?

01:14:15.451 --> 01:14:17.452
Who's my favorite author?

01:14:17.453 --> 01:14:19.579
I don't--I don't know.

01:14:19.580 --> 01:14:20.705
Carlos Castaneda?

01:14:20.706 --> 01:14:22.999
No.
What's my favorite dessert?

01:14:23.000 --> 01:14:24.250
I don't know.

01:14:24.251 --> 01:14:25.251
Why don't you tell me?

01:14:25.252 --> 01:14:26.878
See, don't you think it's strange

01:14:26.879 --> 01:14:28.964
that y--y--you don't
know those things?

01:14:28.965 --> 01:14:31.508
Uh, no.

01:14:31.509 --> 01:14:32.701
Honestly, no.

01:14:34.053 --> 01:14:35.971
There's a lot of stuff
you don't know about me, either.

01:14:35.972 --> 01:14:37.138
But what's the point?

01:14:37.139 --> 01:14:38.390
We are so different.

01:14:38.391 --> 01:14:39.799
There--there's too much--

01:14:41.268 --> 01:14:42.268
I've barely traveled,

01:14:42.269 --> 01:14:44.104
and you're like
a fucking Peace Corps veteran.

01:14:44.105 --> 01:14:45.146
I don't even know--

01:14:45.147 --> 01:14:47.649
What do you see in me, huh?

01:14:47.650 --> 01:14:49.609
And what's to say you won't
just take off and leave

01:14:49.610 --> 01:14:50.610
whenever you want?

01:14:50.611 --> 01:14:52.654
That is kind of
your philosophy, right?

01:14:52.655 --> 01:14:53.947
When life gives you
something better,

01:14:53.948 --> 01:14:55.516
you just--you take off.

01:14:58.077 --> 01:14:59.269
Right?

01:15:01.163 --> 01:15:02.163
That's what you think?

01:15:02.164 --> 01:15:04.207
You think
I'm just waiting around

01:15:04.208 --> 01:15:05.417
till something better
comes along?

01:15:05.418 --> 01:15:07.202
Well, I don't know.
You tell me.

01:15:11.465 --> 01:15:15.510
That was the first time

01:15:15.511 --> 01:15:17.545
I've ever told a guy
that I love him.

01:15:20.099 --> 01:15:21.891
Do you know how shitty
it was for me

01:15:21.892 --> 01:15:23.226
to get that response from you?

01:15:23.227 --> 01:15:25.353
So why are you here?

01:15:25.354 --> 01:15:28.674
Because, idiot...

01:15:29.734 --> 01:15:33.812
I like you, whether you
choose to believe it or not.

01:15:35.698 --> 01:15:38.324
So if you don't think that I
know you because I don't know

01:15:38.325 --> 01:15:41.453
what your fucking favorite
dessert is, then please tell me

01:15:41.454 --> 01:15:42.746
so I can stop imagining

01:15:42.747 --> 01:15:44.531
that this might
actually go somewhere.

Hey! Hey! Hold it!

01:16:36.425 --> 01:16:38.960
Hold it! Fuck! Hey!

01:16:40.805 --> 01:16:42.122
Thank you.

01:16:47.353 --> 01:16:48.887
Hi. How are you?
I have an--

01:16:51.107 --> 01:16:52.774
There he is.
Alan.

01:16:52.775 --> 01:16:53.983
The writing machine.
Hey.

01:16:53.984 --> 01:16:54.984
How you doing?
Good.

01:16:54.985 --> 01:16:56.736
I'm surprised you got
any blood in those fingers

01:16:56.737 --> 01:16:58.404
after all the writing
you've been doing.

01:16:58.405 --> 01:16:59.405
Yeah.

01:16:59.406 --> 01:17:00.406
Get yourself in here.
Okay.

01:17:00.407 --> 01:17:01.407
You know my partner, Scott.

01:17:01.408 --> 01:17:02.408
Yes.
We spoke on the phone.

01:17:02.409 --> 01:17:03.618
How are you?
So nice to meet you.

01:17:03.619 --> 01:17:04.828
Yeah. Welcome. Sit down.
Thank you.

01:17:04.829 --> 01:17:06.121
I like the man bag.

01:17:06.122 --> 01:17:07.122
Oh, thanks, Alan.

01:17:07.123 --> 01:17:08.289
I like what it says about you.

01:17:08.290 --> 01:17:09.290
Yeah?

01:17:09.291 --> 01:17:10.708
Hope there's a couple
more gems in that one.

01:17:10.709 --> 01:17:11.709
Well, me too.

01:17:11.710 --> 01:17:13.878
Help yourself to a
pastry, a little fruit.

01:17:13.879 --> 01:17:14.879
No, thank you.

01:17:14.880 --> 01:17:16.381
Why don't you
knock out a cantaloupe?

01:17:16.382 --> 01:17:17.757
You've been writing, cooped up.

01:17:17.758 --> 01:17:19.134
It's got some micronutrients in it.

01:17:19.135 --> 01:17:20.969
Knock a cantaloupe out.

01:17:20.970 --> 01:17:21.970
Okay.

01:17:21.971 --> 01:17:23.429
Yeah.

01:17:23.430 --> 01:17:24.430
Pop it in there.

01:17:24.431 --> 01:17:25.794
Eat it.

01:17:28.561 --> 01:17:30.979
Okay, so as an overall, general note,

01:17:30.980 --> 01:17:33.523
the stream-of-consciousness
narration's working great.

01:17:33.524 --> 01:17:34.649
Great.

01:17:34.650 --> 01:17:37.610
It is very clear
that this guy is beyond lost

01:17:37.611 --> 01:17:41.990
and has no clue how to navigate
his own obtuse actions.

01:17:41.991 --> 01:17:43.074
Okay, but what I like is,

01:17:43.075 --> 01:17:45.994
he doesn't understand how the
real world works-- Right.

01:17:45.995 --> 01:17:48.163
And he's too afraid to show
himself to the real world,

01:17:48.164 --> 01:17:49.831
and these are the seeds
of his own undoing.

01:17:49.832 --> 01:17:50.832
Oh, I don't--

01:17:50.833 --> 01:17:52.125
He's a child.
Yes.

01:17:52.126 --> 01:17:54.002
He's wandering alone
in the woods, right,

01:17:54.003 --> 01:17:56.171
lost in the ether
of his own neuroses.

01:17:56.172 --> 01:17:58.423
And this is powerful stuff.
Yeah.

01:17:58.424 --> 01:17:59.841
He's saying you wrote
the perfect pussy.

01:17:59.842 --> 01:18:01.593
The perfect pussy?
Yeah, the perfect pussy.

01:18:01.594 --> 01:18:03.595
Now, around chapter 12--
and I'm sorry to interrupt--

01:18:03.596 --> 01:18:06.806
but it's at this point in the
story that it's pretty obvious

01:18:06.807 --> 01:18:08.683
that I completely side with the girl.

01:18:08.684 --> 01:18:10.894
See, for me,
it's more around 11 or 10.

01:18:10.895 --> 01:18:12.353
With the girl?
Are you kidding?

01:18:12.354 --> 01:18:13.521
Well, I think what you do is great,

01:18:13.522 --> 01:18:14.856
'cause you have a protagonist,

01:18:14.857 --> 01:18:18.109
and then you, like a relay race,
hand off the baton and say,

01:18:18.110 --> 01:18:19.110
"Now we're gonna root for this girl."

01:18:19.111 --> 01:18:20.361
And I think you do it
in a way that's elegant

01:18:20.362 --> 01:18:23.031
but, at the same time,
not subtle.

01:18:23.032 --> 01:18:25.783
Yeah, and if I may, like,
how do you not love her?

01:18:25.784 --> 01:18:28.536
And he is such
a spineless, pathetic--

01:18:28.537 --> 01:18:29.537
He's a eunuch, is what he is.

01:18:29.538 --> 01:18:30.955
That's exactly--
You know what I'm saying?

01:18:30.956 --> 01:18:33.124
And I don't mean it literally,
'cause, clearly, they have--

01:18:33.125 --> 01:18:35.418
there's scenes between 'em that
we know what we're talking about,

01:18:35.419 --> 01:18:37.420
but he's a eunuch
in more ways than one.

01:18:37.421 --> 01:18:38.421
I, uh--

01:18:38.422 --> 01:18:39.422
So the point is--

01:18:39.423 --> 01:18:40.423
Do you feel
what I'm saying, though?

01:18:40.424 --> 01:18:41.424
I do.
So okay.

01:18:41.425 --> 01:18:43.551
How would
this metaphorical "eunuch"

01:18:43.552 --> 01:18:44.761
be at all redeemable in her eyes?

01:18:44.762 --> 01:18:45.762
Hold on, guys.

01:18:45.763 --> 01:18:46.763
All due respect,

01:18:46.764 --> 01:18:49.098
this was not my intention
when I wrote the story at all.

01:18:49.099 --> 01:18:50.391
This was not what I was going for.

01:18:50.392 --> 01:18:51.392
Come again?

01:18:51.393 --> 01:18:54.854
Well, I mean, she's so carried
away with this whole thing.

01:18:54.855 --> 01:18:56.147
She's the one
that puts pressure on it.

01:18:56.148 --> 01:18:57.565
She--she makes it heavy.

01:18:57.566 --> 01:18:58.566
No.

01:18:58.567 --> 01:18:59.567
What--how can you say that?

01:18:59.568 --> 01:19:00.902
There's no real connection
between them.

01:19:00.903 --> 01:19:01.903
It's not his fault.

01:19:01.904 --> 01:19:02.904
No connection?
They were in love.

01:19:02.905 --> 01:19:04.572
He just wasn't cognizant enough
to see it.

01:19:04.573 --> 01:19:06.074
Exactly, and now all she can do

01:19:06.075 --> 01:19:08.451
is accept the fact
that he's completely inept.

01:19:08.452 --> 01:19:09.911
That's right.
He had it.

01:19:09.912 --> 01:19:13.456
He lost it because he suffocated
her with his own fear.

01:19:13.457 --> 01:19:15.166
In the end, I mean,
it's obvious

01:19:15.167 --> 01:19:17.585
that it can only be one thing,

01:19:17.586 --> 01:19:20.326
and that's
that he's destined to be alone.

01:19:21.006 --> 01:19:22.840
And it's really honest,
and it's really simple.

01:19:22.841 --> 01:19:24.092
Uh-huh.

01:19:24.093 --> 01:19:25.551
He's cut everyone out.

01:19:25.552 --> 01:19:27.345
He's gonna continue to do that.

01:19:27.346 --> 01:19:29.138
It's not like he's gonna get
over his issues with his mom

01:19:29.139 --> 01:19:30.598
and all that stuff.

01:19:30.599 --> 01:19:32.350
He's giving up
on something great.

01:19:32.351 --> 01:19:34.310
He's gonna spend
the rest of his life

01:19:34.311 --> 01:19:37.397
crippled by the fact that
he wasn't able to show her love.

01:19:37.398 --> 01:19:39.357
And if he did wake up,

01:19:39.358 --> 01:19:41.317
it would be a lot of substances
and a lot of years later.

01:19:41.318 --> 01:19:42.485
Mm-hmm.

01:19:42.486 --> 01:19:44.404
And at that point, she would
have banged half of Manhattan,

01:19:44.405 --> 01:19:46.406
so he wouldn't want her anyway,
So romance or no romance,

01:19:46.407 --> 01:19:47.657
it's--it's over with.

01:19:47.658 --> 01:19:49.158
Yeah.

01:20:03.465 --> 01:20:05.800
That was insane!

01:20:05.801 --> 01:20:08.803
Mercedes and Roberto!

01:20:12.850 --> 01:20:14.884
Hey! Taxi!

01:20:25.279 --> 01:20:26.863
You better hang on
to your oxygen tanks,

01:20:26.864 --> 01:20:27.864
ladies and gentlemen,

01:20:27.865 --> 01:20:31.409
because up next, we
have Henry and Harriet.

01:20:53.849 --> 01:20:55.350
Cookie and Fritz, everybody!

01:20:55.351 --> 01:20:56.351
Cookie and Fritz!

01:20:56.352 --> 01:20:57.602
One more time!

01:20:57.603 --> 01:20:59.645
We only have a few couples left.

01:20:59.646 --> 01:21:03.024
On deck, the lovely
Birdie and her companion,

01:21:03.025 --> 01:21:05.026
the delectable Raymond.

01:21:05.027 --> 01:21:07.695
But first, Earl and Sally,

01:21:07.696 --> 01:21:10.106
or, as they're known
collectively...

01:21:11.241 --> 01:21:12.433
Wow Factor.

01:21:32.846 --> 01:21:34.263
What are you guys doing here?
What are you doing here?

01:21:34.264 --> 01:21:35.598
We came to watch Birdie dance.

01:21:35.599 --> 01:21:36.808
Where is she?
She's over there.

01:21:36.809 --> 01:21:37.850
She's about to go on.

01:21:37.851 --> 01:21:38.976
Okay.

01:21:38.977 --> 01:21:39.977
Give me your stuff.
Give me your stuff.

01:21:39.978 --> 01:21:40.978
Okay.

01:21:40.979 --> 01:21:41.979
Get yourself together.

01:21:41.980 --> 01:21:42.980
Oh, my God.
You look crazy.

01:21:42.981 --> 01:21:43.981
Huh?

01:21:43.982 --> 01:21:45.274
Oh, shoot.

01:21:45.275 --> 01:21:46.734
Okay. Good?

01:21:46.735 --> 01:21:48.361
Get in there.

01:21:48.362 --> 01:21:49.362
How are you guys doing?

01:21:49.363 --> 01:21:50.363
We're--we're great.

01:21:50.364 --> 01:21:51.781
Yeah.
We're--we're compromising.

01:21:51.782 --> 01:21:53.116
Compromising.

01:21:53.117 --> 01:21:54.117
That's great.

01:21:54.118 --> 01:21:55.159
That's so good.

01:21:55.160 --> 01:21:56.160
Get in there.

01:21:56.161 --> 01:21:58.195
All right. Okay.

01:22:00.457 --> 01:22:02.417
Birdie.

01:22:02.418 --> 01:22:04.252
Hi.

01:22:04.253 --> 01:22:05.670
Hi.

01:22:05.671 --> 01:22:07.463
You look amazing.

01:22:07.464 --> 01:22:09.507
Where--where are your parents?

01:22:09.508 --> 01:22:12.093
Um, I--
I called them off.

01:22:12.094 --> 01:22:14.220
I didn't think you were coming.

01:22:14.221 --> 01:22:16.085
Right. Sorry.

01:22:16.932 --> 01:22:19.183
Can we go somewhere
for a second and just talk?

01:22:19.184 --> 01:22:20.627
Can I-I need to--

01:22:23.605 --> 01:22:25.969
We can talk right here.

01:22:29.945 --> 01:22:31.446
I love you.

01:22:31.447 --> 01:22:32.572
Oh, Sam, you--

01:22:32.573 --> 01:22:33.573
you don't have to--

01:22:33.574 --> 01:22:34.657
I know.
I know.

01:22:34.658 --> 01:22:35.658
But I-I do.

01:22:35.659 --> 01:22:36.817
I am in love with you.

01:22:37.453 --> 01:22:39.328
I love you so much.

01:22:39.329 --> 01:22:41.789
It feels really good to say.

01:22:41.790 --> 01:22:44.459
I'm sorry I didn't say it the
other day, but I didn't know

01:22:44.460 --> 01:22:45.626
if I knew in the right way,

01:22:45.627 --> 01:22:47.962
but now I know
that I-I-I knew in every way.

01:22:47.963 --> 01:22:48.963
I knew it.

01:22:48.964 --> 01:22:49.964
I know it, you know?

01:22:50.966 --> 01:22:52.341
Does that make any sense?

01:22:52.342 --> 01:22:54.051
Not really.

01:22:54.052 --> 01:22:55.745
Okay, wait.

01:22:56.430 --> 01:22:59.724
The guy that you fell in love with--

01:22:59.725 --> 01:23:01.142
You.

01:23:01.143 --> 01:23:04.479
No, the guy who, like, plays
guitar and likes pedicures

01:23:04.480 --> 01:23:07.482
and is thinking about
getting a tattoo--

01:23:07.483 --> 01:23:09.517
that's not entirely who I am.

01:23:12.863 --> 01:23:16.991
I based all of that
on your Facebook page

01:23:16.992 --> 01:23:19.686
because I-I wanted
to be your ideal guy.

01:23:24.208 --> 01:23:26.167
I know.

01:23:26.168 --> 01:23:27.335
What?

01:23:27.336 --> 01:23:28.920
I know.

01:23:28.921 --> 01:23:32.507
You're not exactly the most
subtle guy in the world, Sam.

01:23:32.508 --> 01:23:34.008
You knew the whole time?

01:23:34.009 --> 01:23:35.343
Yeah.

01:23:35.344 --> 01:23:37.345
The Origin of Species?
Come on.

01:23:37.346 --> 01:23:38.346
I'm sorry.

01:23:38.347 --> 01:23:40.723
I didn't want to put
myself out there

01:23:40.724 --> 01:23:42.183
and not have a connection.

01:23:42.184 --> 01:23:43.392
I was so afraid.

01:23:43.393 --> 01:23:44.810
But it's there.

01:23:44.811 --> 01:23:46.219
It's been there the whole time.

01:23:48.732 --> 01:23:51.221
Can we please start over, Birdie?

01:23:51.401 --> 01:23:56.155

01:23:58.283 --> 01:23:59.817
No.

01:24:04.206 --> 01:24:06.741
But we can pick up
where we left off.

01:24:10.921 --> 01:24:12.580
Oh, thank you.

01:24:16.301 --> 01:24:18.886
I can't believe you knew
about the profile thing,

01:24:18.887 --> 01:24:19.887
and you didn't tell me.

01:24:19.888 --> 01:24:21.556
Yeah, I even--I even started
putting stuff on there

01:24:21.557 --> 01:24:22.557
just to see if you would do it.

01:24:22.558 --> 01:24:23.891
Are you kidding?

01:24:23.892 --> 01:24:24.892
No.
Like the rock climbing?

01:24:24.893 --> 01:24:25.893
What?
Yeah.

01:24:25.894 --> 01:24:28.145
That was the worst!

01:24:28.146 --> 01:24:29.272
You're the worst!

01:24:29.273 --> 01:24:30.439
Hey, can I tell you
something now?

01:24:30.440 --> 01:24:31.899
I should come clean with this.

01:24:31.900 --> 01:24:32.942
I was actually making up

01:24:32.943 --> 01:24:35.069
the whole male a cappella group thing.

01:24:35.070 --> 01:24:36.404
Mm.

01:24:36.405 --> 01:24:37.488
Nice try.

01:24:48.625 --> 01:24:49.625
Ladies and gentlemen,

01:24:49.626 --> 01:24:51.627
I believe we have a change
in the roster this evening.

01:24:51.628 --> 01:24:52.878
Scratch Raymond.

01:24:53.880 --> 01:24:57.871
This dance will be
Birdie and...

01:24:58.635 --> 01:25:00.294
Whoever you are.

01:25:01.305 --> 01:25:02.713
May I have this dance?

01:25:03.932 --> 01:25:05.182
Yes.

01:25:05.183 --> 01:25:07.059
What the fuck?

01:25:07.060 --> 01:25:09.478
Oh, Raymond, I'm so sorry.

01:25:09.479 --> 01:25:11.147
Let me explain.

01:25:11.148 --> 01:25:13.399
My girlfriend didn't know
I was coming to this thing

01:25:13.400 --> 01:25:15.443
'cause I'm kind of a jackass.

01:25:15.444 --> 01:25:17.320
You better watch out.

01:25:17.321 --> 01:25:21.574
If you ever leave her side
again, I'm swooping in!

01:25:21.575 --> 01:25:23.143
Don't worry about that.

01:25:42.763 --> 01:25:44.001
So...

01:25:45.057 --> 01:25:46.682
Did you finish your book?

01:25:46.683 --> 01:25:47.875
Almost.

01:25:48.977 --> 01:25:51.020

about to change.
