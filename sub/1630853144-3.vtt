00:01.952 --> 00:03.752
Thank you so much for agreeing
to meet with me again.

00:03.871 --> 00:06.205
I know revitalize beauty
seems similar to your concept.

00:06.307 --> 00:09.041
Any similarities
are purely coincidental.

00:09.126 --> 00:10.843
I'm here to convince you
to hire me.

00:12.463 --> 00:14.513
Jackie wanted me to find out
if you could be trusted.

00:14.581 --> 00:17.883
You're welcome to tell jackie
that she has nothing
to worry about.

00:18.469 --> 00:20.052
<i> Let's burn revitalize beauty</i>
<i> to the ground.</i>

00:21.305 --> 00:22.587
Oh, shit.

00:22.690 --> 00:25.024
<i> I just got a bunch of likes</i>
<i> on my "fat bitch" video.</i>

00:25.109 --> 00:26.225
Gael:<i> Why is that</i>
<i> "oh, shit" worthy?</i>

00:26.310 --> 00:27.893
Because they're
from my students.

00:27.978 --> 00:29.194
Who's that guy over there?

00:29.280 --> 00:31.763
Sumi:
<i> Joaquin. He is our newest</i>
<i> coterie member.</i>

00:31.899 --> 00:33.265
Joaquin:
<i> Hey, mom.</i>

00:33.367 --> 00:34.433
Joaquin's mom:
<i> We need to talk</i>
<i> about your sister.</i>

00:34.535 --> 00:36.151
Do you have any idea
where she is?

00:37.321 --> 00:39.538
Joaquin's mom:
<i> The last postcard she sent me</i>
<i> had a return address</i>

00:39.606 --> 00:41.073
<i> from someplace</i>
<i> called the coterie.</i>

00:41.158 --> 00:43.792
Do you always answer a question
with another question?

00:43.911 --> 00:45.210
I thought we were just
having a conversation.

00:45.296 --> 00:46.778
What do you think
of the new guy?

00:46.881 --> 00:47.779
I think he's a dick.

00:48.332 --> 00:50.916
If you wanna invite matt over
for dinner, I'm cool.

00:51.001 --> 00:52.551
Um, he already had
plans tonight.

00:52.619 --> 00:54.586
-Matt dumped me.
-What?

00:55.506 --> 00:56.755
Malika:
<i> When angelica told me</i>

00:56.891 --> 00:58.757
she had a friend working
in the city council office,

00:58.893 --> 01:01.593
I didn't expect it to be
an actual city council person.

01:01.679 --> 01:04.263
I need somebody like you
on my team.

01:04.398 --> 01:05.230
Come work for me.

01:05.299 --> 01:07.566
I got a job with the aclu.

01:07.634 --> 01:10.069
(all exclaiming)

01:10.137 --> 01:11.403
callie:

01:11.472 --> 01:12.438
Mariana:
<i> When do you leave?</i>

01:12.523 --> 01:13.605
Callie:
<i> In two days.</i>

02:04.492 --> 02:08.627
so... You never told me
about your first day

02:08.695 --> 02:10.963
Oh, yeah, that feels like
a million years ago.

02:11.048 --> 02:12.664
-Really?
-Yes.

02:12.800 --> 02:15.134
-How was it?
-Stressful.

02:15.202 --> 02:17.169
For one,
I couldn't figure out

Williams.

03:10.808 --> 03:11.857
Lucia hired me.

03:13.060 --> 03:14.526
Yes, the bartender.

03:14.612 --> 03:15.694
And activist.

03:15.762 --> 03:16.778
Nice to meet you.

03:16.897 --> 03:18.363
-Tracy, can you show her around?
-Sure.

03:18.449 --> 03:19.231
We'll talk soon.

03:19.366 --> 03:20.566
Okay.

03:21.785 --> 03:24.436
That was will.
He's lucia's chief of staff,
in case you didn't know.

03:24.538 --> 03:25.604
He wears goofy ties

03:25.739 --> 03:27.573
and truly believes
government can make a difference

03:27.708 --> 03:28.574
in people's lives,

03:28.709 --> 03:30.275
even in the absence
of any proof.

03:30.377 --> 03:32.077
Personally, I don't think
highly of government,

03:32.162 --> 03:33.495
but I do love
my government job.

03:34.081 --> 03:35.747
I never have to worry
about my employer
going out of business,

03:35.883 --> 03:37.549
I get every holiday off,
the benefits are great,

03:37.635 --> 03:39.501
and it's almost impossible
to get fired.

03:40.170 --> 03:42.087
So, the staffers sit here
and man the phones.

03:42.223 --> 03:44.006
You'll get
a lot of angry callers.

03:44.124 --> 03:45.507
Pretend to care
about their complaints,

03:45.626 --> 03:46.625
bite your tongue
when they scream at you

03:46.760 --> 03:48.126
that as a taxpayer
you work for them.

03:48.262 --> 03:50.145
Then get them off the line
as fast as you can.

03:50.898 --> 03:51.930
Okay, tour's over.

03:53.300 --> 03:54.233
Any questions so far?

03:54.968 --> 03:57.402
Uh, no. No.

03:57.688 --> 03:58.570
Yup.

04:01.275 --> 04:02.658
Uh-- should I just--

04:05.863 --> 04:06.828
okay.

04:08.032 --> 04:10.365
That sounds like
a pretty typical first day
to me.

04:10.484 --> 04:11.617
You know, I just thought

04:11.752 --> 04:14.036
since lucia sought me out
to work at her office

04:14.154 --> 04:15.704
that she would be the one
to show me around.

04:15.822 --> 04:17.956
But it's like you need
a vip wristband

04:18.042 --> 04:19.174
just to say
good morning.

04:19.927 --> 04:21.426
I mean,
you know lucia.

04:21.495 --> 04:25.597
Do you have any advice
on how to get her attention?

04:26.884 --> 04:29.051
Not really.
I mean, that's sort of
why we broke up.

04:29.169 --> 04:31.303
She was either on her phone
or talking about work.

04:33.274 --> 04:34.890
Like me right now.

04:35.008 --> 04:37.309
No, it's okay.
That's okay, it's okay.

04:37.394 --> 04:38.193
I'm sorry.

04:48.739 --> 04:51.740
It's just, you know,
I thought I was hired
to further my work at dpn,

04:51.825 --> 04:53.625
and I have all these ideas
to share,

04:53.694 --> 04:56.495
and I can't even get
a minute of her time.

04:58.248 --> 04:59.631
Are you sure
you want to do this?

04:59.700 --> 05:01.032
Because you don't have to.

05:01.585 --> 05:03.385
Taking this job
is the only way

05:03.504 --> 05:05.470
that we can prove
that jackie stole our idea.

05:05.923 --> 05:07.639
I'm just gonna
slip on in

05:07.708 --> 05:09.841
and snap a photo
of our stolen source code

05:09.927 --> 05:11.009
and then get out.

05:11.145 --> 05:13.845
Then we shut them down
on copyright infringement

05:13.931 --> 05:15.480
and then it's
bye-bye, revitalize!

05:15.549 --> 05:17.816
Easy-peasy, we'll be
in and out in a day.

05:19.052 --> 05:21.753
How've you been doing,
with callie gone?

05:25.609 --> 05:26.692
Great!

05:28.395 --> 05:31.196
If you're lonesome,
I can move back in.

05:32.566 --> 05:34.666
Oh, thank you.

05:35.569 --> 05:38.537
But, you know, I love
having the loft to myself.

05:39.340 --> 05:41.873
And callie snored a lot
when she slept on her back.

05:43.410 --> 05:44.376
I'd have to...

05:45.346 --> 05:47.179
Throw my slippers at her
every once in a while.

05:52.886 --> 05:54.853
You know-- so it's--
you know, it's really nice

05:54.921 --> 05:55.920
how quiet it is.

05:56.056 --> 05:57.356
In fact, it's so quiet

05:57.441 --> 06:00.392
that I can hear the little mice
scurrying around at night.

06:04.398 --> 06:05.447
You get used to it.

06:07.401 --> 06:09.818
Claire: What about
the revitalize beauty girls?

06:09.903 --> 06:12.738
Like, do you think
jackie might've shared
her suspicions with them?

06:13.874 --> 06:15.073
I don't think so.

06:15.876 --> 06:17.542
They seemed pretty clueless.

06:22.833 --> 06:24.416

06:42.569 --> 06:44.736
<i> and a video you made</i>
<i> called "fat bitch"?</i>

06:45.906 --> 06:47.773
No, I didn't show her
that video.

06:47.858 --> 06:48.940
Grace:
<i> Well, she saw it</i>

new project supervisor.

08:16.630 --> 08:17.762
Uh, nice to meet you.

08:17.848 --> 08:19.598
Jackie's told me

08:20.184 --> 08:21.933
-Oh, really?
-Really.

08:23.637 --> 08:24.736
Which reminds me,

things don't work out here,

you can't work at

T-- two years?

08:40.204 --> 08:43.538
Great! Um, yeah, I will just
look this over really quick

08:43.657 --> 08:44.789
and get it

08:47.177 --> 08:48.593

08:51.798 --> 08:52.997
End of day
sounds great.

08:53.100 --> 08:54.299
-Great.
-Great.

09:00.390 --> 09:01.773
I truly believe government

09:01.841 --> 09:03.358
can make a difference
in people's lives,

09:04.027 --> 09:07.612
which is why I have dedicated
my life and career to service.

09:07.698 --> 09:09.981
Fun fact. Many of you
may not know this,

09:10.117 --> 09:12.784
but I could have pursued
a career as an actor.

09:13.520 --> 09:16.404
I have my sag card,
and I appeared in several...

09:17.291 --> 09:20.659
Well, two episodes of
<i> the fresh prince of bel-air!</i>

09:21.128 --> 09:23.295
(silence)

09:23.363 --> 09:25.463
anyway, number one
on the agenda

09:25.532 --> 09:27.916
is funding our
families first initiative.

09:28.034 --> 09:30.418
That's also number two
through infinity.

09:30.537 --> 09:33.255
However, there is
one sticking point with lucia,

09:33.373 --> 09:35.173
which is an expansion
of rent control.

09:35.709 --> 09:38.226
She's getting some pushback,
but we want that in the bill.

09:38.345 --> 09:40.044
So we need to gather research

09:40.147 --> 09:41.813
and write up a brief
that will convince her.

09:41.881 --> 09:43.565
Let's get to work, everyone.
Thank you.

09:44.884 --> 09:46.651
Will, can I have a word?

09:46.737 --> 09:47.986
Sure. What's up?

09:48.054 --> 09:50.272
I was just wondering
if you've had a chance

09:50.390 --> 09:52.357
to go over the proposal
I put on your desk.

09:53.777 --> 09:55.994
Sorry, uh, I'm all about
helping women

09:56.062 --> 09:57.662
who've been impacted
by incarceration.

09:58.565 --> 10:00.115
In fact, I dated a girl
in high school

10:00.233 --> 10:02.500
who's in prison
for attempted murder
of her boyfriend.

10:03.537 --> 10:04.569
I dodged that one.

10:05.339 --> 10:07.672
Anyway, I promise we will get
to this important issue

10:07.758 --> 10:08.923
eventually.

10:11.011 --> 10:13.628
Excuse me, uh,
lucia's mine on tuesdays.

10:13.747 --> 10:15.680
She's expecting me.
I won't take long.

10:17.050 --> 10:18.099
Who's the new girl?

10:18.218 --> 10:20.518
Oh. Malika williams.
Former activist.

10:21.638 --> 10:23.421
I assume you did a thorough
background check on her.

10:23.523 --> 10:25.557
-Of course.
-Oh, I'd like to read it.

10:25.642 --> 10:27.892
Just in case
there are any red flags.

10:31.898 --> 10:34.449
Hey. Who is that woman
looking at me?

10:34.985 --> 10:36.568
Oh, that's scary dana.

10:36.653 --> 10:38.787
She's lucia's
reelection campaign manager.

10:39.539 --> 10:40.705
Scary how?

10:40.774 --> 10:42.940
She just gives off
a miranda priestly vibe.

10:43.043 --> 10:44.542
And will hates her.

10:44.611 --> 10:45.627
They're always
in a tug of war

10:45.746 --> 10:47.329
for lucia's time
and attention.

10:47.447 --> 10:49.798
(scoffs) you do not want
to get in those crosshairs.

10:51.001 --> 10:52.083
Okay.

10:55.839 --> 10:57.088
So what's this for?

10:57.174 --> 10:58.256
-It's-- it's--
-man: Your burritos.

10:58.725 --> 10:59.758
Thank you.

11:00.794 --> 11:01.893
Here you go.

11:01.978 --> 11:04.229
So it's a non-profit
online news source,

11:04.297 --> 11:05.563
and I'm doing
a story right now

11:05.632 --> 11:07.298
about the homeless crisis
in la.

11:07.401 --> 11:08.433
Oh, cool.

11:08.852 --> 11:09.818
So...

11:11.971 --> 11:13.104
How long have
you been homeless?

11:15.025 --> 11:16.324
Since I was 14.

11:16.443 --> 11:17.909
-So for about...
-Ten years.

11:17.977 --> 11:18.743
I see.

11:18.812 --> 11:21.079
And how-- how'd you--

11:21.147 --> 11:22.747
how'd you end up
on the streets at 14?

11:23.250 --> 11:26.451
So my, uh, parents died
in a car accident.

11:26.920 --> 11:29.621
Um, I was in a bunch
of bad foster situations.

11:29.706 --> 11:31.256
-Mm-hmm.
-So I bounced.

11:31.341 --> 11:33.007
I hitchhiked around
all over.

11:33.760 --> 11:36.511
And, um, I've been living
in la for, like, a year now.

11:37.330 --> 11:38.430
I'm sorry to hear that.

11:38.498 --> 11:40.682
Oh, no, it's cool.
I mean, I love to travel

11:40.801 --> 11:43.134
and I've gotten
to see a lot of, like,
really cool places, so.

11:46.189 --> 11:47.772
How have you survived
for...

11:48.675 --> 11:49.641
For 10 years?

11:50.677 --> 11:51.976
I don't know, you'd--

11:52.112 --> 11:54.846
I mean, I-- I try to avoid,
you know, bad situations.

11:54.948 --> 11:56.448
Make friends
where you can.

11:56.533 --> 11:58.616
But you just gotta,
like, keep going,

11:58.685 --> 12:00.285
you know, and be happy.

12:00.370 --> 12:04.406
You know, I-- I try
to aggressively be happy,
like, every day.

12:04.491 --> 12:07.292
And I've never actually
had to dumpster dive, you know?

12:07.377 --> 12:10.295
'cause, you know,
'cause I got my sign, so.

12:11.081 --> 12:13.331
-Keeping it simple, huh?
-Worked on you, didn't it?

12:16.202 --> 12:18.586
Revitalize beauty
is committed to sustainability.

12:18.705 --> 12:21.139
...Committed to sustainability.

12:22.142 --> 12:25.477
We are ethically compatible
to your brand's values.

12:25.545 --> 12:27.512
We're ethically compatible
to your brand's values.

12:27.647 --> 12:28.646
...Brand's values.

12:29.015 --> 12:30.432
But take your time.

12:30.550 --> 12:32.434
I'll circle back
in a week or so.

12:32.519 --> 12:34.986
Think about it, and no rush.

12:35.071 --> 12:38.156
Okay, yes. Great!
Thank you. You too.

12:38.825 --> 12:40.859
Oooh. Hey, how about
a coffee break?

12:40.944 --> 12:42.110
Love.

12:42.228 --> 12:44.028
They've got a great barista
downstairs.

12:44.781 --> 12:46.531
You know what?
I'm good.

12:46.616 --> 12:48.900
I think I hit
my caffeine limit
for the day.

12:49.002 --> 12:50.168
I think I'm just
gonna push through.

12:50.253 --> 12:51.536
I love your work ethic.

12:51.621 --> 12:52.921
Love!

13:08.104 --> 13:09.687
-So how's it going?
-(gasps)

13:09.756 --> 13:11.389
sorry, didn't mean
to scare you.

13:11.525 --> 13:12.557
No, I'm not afraid of you.

13:12.642 --> 13:15.727
I-- I mean, no, um,
you didn't scare me.

13:16.863 --> 13:18.897
So did you have a chance
to read and sign your contract?

13:19.766 --> 13:20.865
Uh, not yet.

13:20.934 --> 13:23.785
I've been so busy
reelin' these brands in.

13:23.904 --> 13:25.770
But, you know,
I-- I just realized

13:25.872 --> 13:27.906
I didn't get the password
to the app.

13:27.991 --> 13:30.909
No one has access to the app
until they sign their contract.

13:30.994 --> 13:32.377
Company policy.

13:33.246 --> 13:34.412
Of course.

13:34.498 --> 13:36.781
Well, you know,
I should probably
get on that then.

13:36.883 --> 13:37.882
Fabulous.

13:43.557 --> 13:44.722
Oh, shit.

13:52.816 --> 13:53.932
I'm so sorry.

13:54.518 --> 13:57.435
Everyone on the equity committee
is so upset about this.

13:58.071 --> 13:59.103
Thank you.

13:59.189 --> 14:00.805
I'm sorry
that I let you all down.

14:00.941 --> 14:02.190
You didn't.

14:02.859 --> 14:06.828
You've been a great ally
and a champion for the kids.

14:07.864 --> 14:09.080
You won't be forgotten.

14:10.500 --> 14:12.116

lucia's campaign manager.

15:08.275 --> 15:09.741
You free to grab
some coffee?

15:10.193 --> 15:11.276
Sure.

15:12.412 --> 15:13.528
Oh. Like right now?

If it's convenient

You don't need

15:22.422 --> 15:23.621
Okay.

15:31.464 --> 15:33.848
So I can't get
a regular job

15:33.967 --> 15:36.334
because, uh, I don't have
my birth certificate,

15:36.436 --> 15:37.602
so I can't get an id.

15:37.670 --> 15:38.886
Where's your
birth certificate at?

15:39.439 --> 15:40.805
-I was born at home.
-Ah.

15:40.941 --> 15:42.140
Yeah, and I guess
my parents

15:42.225 --> 15:44.609
just never registered
for one, you know?

15:44.694 --> 15:45.977
I mean,
I've tried to apply,

15:46.112 --> 15:48.112
but, you know,
they make it hard.

15:49.015 --> 15:52.016
I mean, I don't have
a present address.

15:52.118 --> 15:54.152
I don't know where
my birth took place.

15:54.237 --> 15:57.038
No witnesses I know of
to, like, vouch for me,
you know?

15:58.692 --> 15:59.657
Tell me this.

16:00.360 --> 16:01.692
What do you see
for your future?

16:01.828 --> 16:04.162
You know, like,
what do you--
what do you want?

16:05.081 --> 16:08.499
I mean, I would like
to get indoors, you know?

16:08.585 --> 16:12.470
Um, but I actually
really want to be a dancer,
you know?

16:12.538 --> 16:14.973
Um, sometimes,
if I make enough
on the street,

16:15.041 --> 16:16.257
I go and take a class.

16:16.376 --> 16:18.676
But, you know, it's just--
it's expensive out here.

16:18.762 --> 16:19.727
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

16:23.984 --> 16:24.983
Hey! Hey!

16:25.485 --> 16:26.818
Hey, man,
that's my stuff!

16:26.903 --> 16:27.885
Officer:
Stay back.

16:27.988 --> 16:29.103
-No, no, please.
-You weren't here.

16:29.189 --> 16:30.688
I was just getting something
to eat, all right?

16:30.774 --> 16:32.323
Just please let me grab
my duffel bag--

16:32.392 --> 16:34.242
joaquin:
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
Hey, man, come on!

16:34.361 --> 16:35.860
Wha-- what are you doing?
Let him get his things.

16:35.945 --> 16:37.528
He should've paid attention
to the notices.

16:37.614 --> 16:39.747
He had 48 hours
to move his stuff.
Now get back!

16:39.866 --> 16:42.033
No, no, that sign
was not here this morning.

16:42.118 --> 16:43.701
Please, man,
you're throwing away my life!

16:43.787 --> 16:45.703
You can pick up your things
at the reclamation center.

16:47.073 --> 16:49.207
And where's that at?
Yo, excuse me!

16:49.709 --> 16:51.426
Don't bother.
It's as good as gone!

16:53.579 --> 16:56.047
They take everyone's stuff.
They pack it into these bags.

16:56.182 --> 16:58.383
They barely use any tags
and you can't find your stuff.

16:58.518 --> 17:00.018
And then, you know,
after 60 days,

17:00.086 --> 17:01.519
they dump, it's gone.

17:03.589 --> 17:05.023
That's the thing
about being invisible.

17:06.359 --> 17:07.775
No one cares
when they erase you.

17:16.202 --> 17:18.286
Bankers box.
That's never a good sign.

17:22.275 --> 17:23.241
(davia sniffles)

17:26.446 --> 17:28.296
whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
What happened?

17:28.415 --> 17:29.630
I can't talk about it.

17:32.669 --> 17:34.969
-Why?
-I just can't.

17:37.957 --> 17:39.223
Not with you.

17:45.131 --> 17:48.149
Getting fired just makes me feel
like I'm a bad person.

17:49.436 --> 17:51.185
And that I failed
as a teacher.

17:51.905 --> 17:55.022
I'm never gonna be good enough
for anything or anyone.

17:55.808 --> 17:57.325
That's not true.
You're good enough for me,

17:58.644 --> 18:01.279
matt, and everyone
who loves you.

18:02.449 --> 18:04.115
Getting fired
because of that video

18:04.200 --> 18:06.150
just brings up
all the shame I've ever felt

18:06.286 --> 18:08.453
about myself or my body.

18:14.327 --> 18:16.260
You remember the last time
we sang together?

18:18.548 --> 18:19.964
Yeah, I'm never allowed back
in that club.

18:20.100 --> 18:22.633
You out-heckled a heckler.

18:22.719 --> 18:24.802
You got in his face
and you refused

18:24.938 --> 18:27.054
to let him tell you
that you sucked.

18:27.140 --> 18:29.440
No, I was mostly
defending you.

18:29.509 --> 18:30.858
Okay, well...

18:32.445 --> 18:34.479
You need to learn
to defend yourself.

18:36.015 --> 18:37.365
And instead of looking
at this as a failure,

18:37.484 --> 18:40.201
maybe see it
as an opportunity to pause,

18:41.821 --> 18:45.656
reassess what you want
out of your life and career.

18:45.742 --> 18:47.191
Maybe this is the universe
telling you

18:47.327 --> 18:48.826
to see what else
is out there.

18:49.829 --> 18:50.995
Find your toast truck.

18:55.201 --> 18:57.001
Why are you being
so nice to me?

19:00.373 --> 19:02.006
You said that
we're better off as friends.

19:03.876 --> 19:05.143
So I'm being your friend.

19:07.764 --> 19:09.814
Why don't you think
that you can talk to me?

19:13.553 --> 19:16.070
Because you still think
that you're the one
who has to take care of me?

19:28.284 --> 19:29.367
Close your eyes.

19:30.203 --> 19:31.702
-Why?
-Trust me.

19:32.238 --> 19:33.371
Close your eyes.

19:42.298 --> 19:44.765
Dana: So tell me
why you left activism
to work in politics.

19:46.135 --> 19:49.554
Because in government,
you have greater access
to financial resources

19:49.639 --> 19:52.089
and power to make real change
in people's lives,

19:52.192 --> 19:54.225
if you're doing
the people's work.

19:54.310 --> 19:55.726
And you want
tax dollars invested

19:55.862 --> 19:58.362
in helping women
impacted by incarceration?

19:58.431 --> 20:01.566
Yes! In fact, I submitted
a proposal to will,

20:01.651 --> 20:05.286
but he's pretty focused on
the families first initiative,
so.

20:05.405 --> 20:06.904
Let me give you
a word of advice.

20:08.774 --> 20:10.741
The three
most important words
in politics:

20:10.827 --> 20:12.410
Quid. Pro. Quo.

20:13.296 --> 20:15.830
Find out what will wants,
get it for him,

20:15.948 --> 20:17.798
and then collect
by getting what you want.

20:20.453 --> 20:21.552
Thanks for the advice.

20:21.621 --> 20:23.087
Another word of advice.

20:23.956 --> 20:25.256
There is no free advice.

20:27.093 --> 20:28.342
I'm a powerful ally.

20:29.462 --> 20:32.563
I'll be of help to you
as long as you're
of help to me.

20:35.435 --> 20:36.317
How does that sound?

20:38.688 --> 20:39.604

I totally get it.

How much you like me.

36:25.400 --> 36:27.250
-Well...
-I know you like me.

36:27.369 --> 36:28.418
Of course.

36:35.544 --> 36:37.377
Yes. I do.
