01:17.834 --> 01:18.959
We once turned
to our families...

01:18.960 --> 01:21.250
Hey, that would
be swell!

01:21.251 --> 01:22.333
And friends.

01:22.334 --> 01:24.750
-Here, let me do it for you.
-Thanks, Bill.

01:24.751 --> 01:28.166
Creating bonds with
the people around us.

01:28.167 --> 01:30.750
Hello, Eileen.
Good to see you.

01:30.751 --> 01:32.834
Now we turn

01:32.835 --> 01:34.375
to the network.

01:34.376 --> 01:38.041
Our devices have become
our constant companions...

01:38.042 --> 01:41.417
even when we're not alone.

01:41.418 --> 01:45.834
Is this the beginning
of a beautiful relationship

01:45.835 --> 01:49.458
or the end of relationships
as we know them?

02:13.125 --> 02:15.000
Summer was emotional for me.

02:17.875 --> 02:22.041
I remember feeling lonely
a lot.

02:23.792 --> 02:25.000
I shut down and didn't really
talk that much

02:25.001 --> 02:26.959
with a lot of people.

02:26.960 --> 02:31.041
I was very emotional.

02:31.042 --> 02:32.250
I was in
a very vulnerable state.

02:35.667 --> 02:38.834
This other part
of me was gone.

02:46.291 --> 02:48.542
Genia Kudya moved
to San Francisco

02:48.543 --> 02:51.667
in early 2015.

02:51.668 --> 02:53.166
Months later, she was joined

02:53.167 --> 02:57.834
by her closest friend,
Roman Mazurenko.

03:00.417 --> 03:04.083
Roman and I, we could
always understand each other,

03:04.084 --> 03:07.333
maybe because
we were dreamers.

03:07.334 --> 03:09.667
Maybe because
we'd share his belief

03:09.668 --> 03:12.709
that everything is gonna
work out in some way.

03:14.500 --> 03:17.333
Roman and his friends
were throwing amazing parties.

03:17.334 --> 03:18.875
He had, like,
a special understanding

03:18.876 --> 03:21.875
of how the people worked

03:21.876 --> 03:26.166
and what you need to give them
in order for them to be happy.

03:26.167 --> 03:27.750
He would always do something

03:27.751 --> 03:31.083
that was absolutely
global and beautiful.

03:32.542 --> 03:37.417
To some extent,
maybe it was fantasy land.

03:37.418 --> 03:38.417
But I have never felt, like,

03:38.418 --> 03:40.792
a connection like that
with anyone.

03:43.166 --> 03:47.291
Then suddenly...

03:47.292 --> 03:48.709
Roman died.

03:54.375 --> 03:56.667
The morning the day Roman died,

03:56.668 --> 03:59.375
I actually was supposed to go
get breakfast with him

03:59.376 --> 04:01.875
and two of my other friends.

04:01.876 --> 04:03.792
And then after brunch,

04:03.793 --> 04:05.375
I was supposed
to take them somewhere,

04:05.376 --> 04:07.583
and I had a car.

04:07.584 --> 04:11.125
But since I didn't go there,
they actually walked.

04:11.126 --> 04:13.375
And Roman got hit by a car.

04:16.625 --> 04:18.250
It's different now.

04:18.250 --> 04:21.834
And something really,
really important changed in me.

04:21.834 --> 04:25.792
Genia threw herself
into her work.

04:27.417 --> 04:29.000
As the cofounder of an

04:29.001 --> 04:31.291
artificial intelligence
startup,

04:31.292 --> 04:35.041
she turned to technology
to cope with her grief.

04:35.042 --> 04:39.083
It's one thing to just remember
your dead friend once a day,

04:39.084 --> 04:42.125
but another thing to keep
communicating with him...

04:42.126 --> 04:44.166
even after he died.

06:01.375 --> 06:04.125
Kaname Hayashi is an engineer

06:04.126 --> 06:06.709
known as the father of Pepper,

06:06.710 --> 06:09.208
an A.I.-powered social robot,

06:09.209 --> 06:11.041
a humanoid programmed to detect

06:11.042 --> 06:14.542
our every expression...

06:14.543 --> 06:18.917
to read our emotions
and respond like a friend.

07:54.542 --> 07:55.291
Behind Pepper's eyes

07:55.292 --> 07:58.625
is a network of sensors

07:58.626 --> 08:00.500
that watch, record...
Pepper.

08:00.501 --> 08:03.792
And respond.

08:05.625 --> 08:08.041
But for Sekora Yamashta,

08:08.042 --> 08:10.500
he's not just
a piece of hardware.

08:13.333 --> 08:16.417
Pepper is part of her family.

08:38.041 --> 08:40.207
Pepper.

08:40.208 --> 08:41.542
Hai.

08:41.543 --> 08:44.000
Pepper!

09:04.709 --> 09:07.458
Emotional connections

09:07.459 --> 09:10.000
delivered by devices,

09:10.001 --> 09:12.583
powered by code.

09:12.584 --> 09:15.625
We are changing the fabric
of our relationships...

09:18.959 --> 09:22.000
one keystroke at a time.

09:29.417 --> 09:30.667
I think that looks
pretty good, don't you?

09:34.834 --> 09:38.375
Let's see. Does this fit
perfectly right here?

09:39.709 --> 09:44.166
I think this furniture
looks pretty good.

09:44.167 --> 09:45.500
Right?

09:45.501 --> 09:46.917
Yeah.

09:46.918 --> 09:50.583
Layla is a typical
American teenager.

09:50.584 --> 09:52.417
A freshman in high school...

09:54.792 --> 09:57.667
she spends most of her time
on her phone.

09:57.668 --> 09:59.792
You're still
taking pictures.

09:59.793 --> 10:01.041
Yeah.

10:01.042 --> 10:02.500
Can I ask you why?

10:02.501 --> 10:05.250
It's just another way
to connect with my friends.

10:05.251 --> 10:06.667
Okay.

10:08.583 --> 10:12.000
Sarah De Luke is
a typical American mom

10:12.001 --> 10:13.875
concerned about her
child's screen time.

10:13.876 --> 10:16.792
My friend and I,
we just type "LOL"

10:16.793 --> 10:19.792
back and forth for,
like, hours.

10:19.793 --> 10:22.291
Do you feel like you need
somebody to talk to?

10:22.292 --> 10:24.625
I don't know.

10:24.626 --> 10:26.250
I know.
I just don't know...

10:26.251 --> 10:27.583
I don't always know
if you're comfortable

10:27.584 --> 10:30.667
talking to me about things.

10:30.668 --> 10:32.458
I worry about my relationship
with Layla all the time.

10:32.459 --> 10:36.125
So I try to be creative

10:36.126 --> 10:38.792
and come up with different
ways for us to communicate.

10:38.793 --> 10:41.875
So do you like
doing the doll house?

10:41.876 --> 10:44.125
Honestly, I just like playing
with the clothes and stuff.

10:44.126 --> 10:46.667
That's fine.

10:46.668 --> 10:49.875
When you're a kid,
your world just seems so small

10:49.876 --> 10:53.000
because it's your family,
your school friends,

10:53.001 --> 10:54.750
and you want to know
what's out there.

10:54.751 --> 10:56.917
You want to know
about other people.

10:56.918 --> 11:00.625
Sarah's concern
about her daughter grew

11:00.626 --> 11:02.625
when Layla began
using her phone

11:02.626 --> 11:07.000
to access a world far
from her quiet Dallas suburb.

11:07.001 --> 11:10.125
She started meeting people

11:10.126 --> 11:11.500
in a game called
Avakin Life...

11:13.125 --> 11:18.750
a virtual community made up
of millions of people

11:18.751 --> 11:21.000
from around the world.

11:21.001 --> 11:22.834
I wanted to play a game

11:22.835 --> 11:24.917
where you can make an avatar,
and you can play around

11:24.918 --> 11:28.000
because I just wanted
to find something fun.

11:28.001 --> 11:30.959
You can buy clothes and hair,
and there's, like,

11:30.960 --> 11:33.208
different places
you could visit.

11:33.209 --> 11:37.000
It's kind of, like, real life,
but it's on a game.

11:37.001 --> 11:39.375
On her phone,

11:39.376 --> 11:42.375
Layla could be
anyone she wanted.

11:42.376 --> 11:45.041
I made up a story
I was telling people in there.

11:45.042 --> 11:49.667
I said that my father's in
prison 'cause he was a drunk,

11:49.668 --> 11:52.208
and he killed my mom
in an accident.

11:52.209 --> 11:57.208
He's in jail, but he's trying
to keep in contact with us.

11:57.209 --> 12:01.375
I kind of just pretended
to be someone else.

12:01.376 --> 12:03.917
Sarah eventually caught on.

12:03.918 --> 12:04.625
I did read some of the incoming

12:04.626 --> 12:06.709
messages she was getting.

12:06.710 --> 12:09.709
She was talking to a gentleman,

12:09.710 --> 12:11.542
and he was telling her
how, you know,

12:11.543 --> 12:14.000
he felt so sorry for her

12:14.001 --> 12:16.792
and he just wanted to hug her
and kiss her all over.

12:16.793 --> 12:19.625
And, you know, I'm like,
he has no idea

12:19.626 --> 12:23.000
he's sitting here talking
to a 13-, 14-year-old girl.

12:24.917 --> 12:27.291
Disturbed by what she found

12:27.292 --> 12:28.250
on Layla's phone,

12:28.251 --> 12:31.000
Sarah installed
monitoring software.

12:31.001 --> 12:33.875
Now she tracks
everything Layla does.

12:33.876 --> 12:37.417
I can see every
picture she takes.

12:37.418 --> 12:38.583
It doesn't matter

12:38.584 --> 12:41.417
if she sends it to somebody
or if she deletes it.

12:41.418 --> 12:43.750
I can geo-track her.

12:43.751 --> 12:46.291
You can set boundaries

12:46.292 --> 12:47.917
so that if they cross
the boundary,

12:47.918 --> 12:51.291
you get an alert.

12:51.292 --> 12:53.917
It tells you who she calls,
who's called her,

12:53.918 --> 12:57.041
how long the call lasts.

12:57.042 --> 12:58.917
I get a daily report

12:58.918 --> 13:01.917
of text messages
for the last 24 hours,

13:01.918 --> 13:04.250
which is a lot
of text messages.

13:09.083 --> 13:11.834
The thing that scares me
the most about her being online

13:11.835 --> 13:13.667
is putting something out there

13:13.668 --> 13:15.959
that she can't take back

13:15.960 --> 13:18.709
or that she's gonna regret
in the future.

13:18.710 --> 13:20.417
Our digital footprints

13:20.418 --> 13:23.291
are everlasting.

13:25.625 --> 13:28.625
Every text, every chat

13:28.626 --> 13:32.458
is memorialized in code,

13:32.459 --> 13:34.834
little pieces of us that

13:34.835 --> 13:38.458
live on even after we die.

13:38.459 --> 13:40.583
Roman gave me a real

13:40.584 --> 13:44.333
understanding of myself.

13:44.334 --> 13:49.291
I think I miss every single
part of his being...

13:49.292 --> 13:52.166
His sense of humor,
his beauty.

13:52.167 --> 13:53.625
He was a very beautiful person.

13:53.626 --> 13:55.542
He had such good charisma

13:55.543 --> 14:00.166
and such a good energy.

14:00.167 --> 14:03.333
I just miss, like,
the whole person.

14:03.334 --> 14:06.333
For years,

14:06.334 --> 14:09.667
Dmitry Pyanov
lived with Roman,

14:09.668 --> 14:12.166
his best friend and mentor.

14:12.167 --> 14:15.333
Today, he works with Genia

14:15.334 --> 14:17.250
as a community manager

14:17.251 --> 14:19.208
at her San Francisco-based
startup.

14:19.209 --> 14:24.041
After Roman died,
I felt very, very sad.

14:24.042 --> 14:25.333
He didn't really
leave anything.

14:25.334 --> 14:27.166
He was, like, an inventor
and, you know,

14:27.167 --> 14:30.250
such a creative person, but he
didn't leave anything for us.

14:30.251 --> 14:34.083
So I started going through
our text messaging history

14:34.084 --> 14:35.500
just because it was
the only way to remember.

14:40.667 --> 14:42.041
Roman was addicted to
messaging.

14:42.042 --> 14:47.959
He would just spend
all his day texting.

14:47.960 --> 14:49.875
And so I thought, you know,
what if we use

14:49.876 --> 14:51.000
this history of his texts,

14:51.001 --> 14:54.959
and can we actually
build an avatar for him?

14:54.960 --> 14:57.917
Genia wanted to use
her company's technology

14:57.918 --> 15:01.500
to create something
entirely new...

15:01.501 --> 15:04.208
An artificially intelligent
chatbot that could mimic

15:04.209 --> 15:08.542
a specific person's
speech patterns and tone,

15:08.543 --> 15:13.333
an avatar built from
the words Roman left behind.

15:13.334 --> 15:15.083
When Genia told me

15:15.084 --> 15:19.083
that we should make an A.I.
out of Roman's data,

15:19.084 --> 15:22.750
I said, like, "Hell, yes,
we should do that,"

15:22.751 --> 15:25.750
because that's what he would do.

15:27.291 --> 15:29.583
With the approval
of Roman's family,

15:29.584 --> 15:33.542
Genia and Dmitry started
to rebuild their friend.

15:33.543 --> 15:37.375
We've collected all
the text conversations

15:37.376 --> 15:39.125
from our messengers,

15:39.126 --> 15:42.750
from our SMS, Facebook,
WhatsApp,

15:42.751 --> 15:44.667
and we collected all the data.

15:47.667 --> 15:49.250
We also asked our best friends

15:49.251 --> 15:51.000
to send their text exchanges,
as well.

15:52.083 --> 15:54.041
With each additional

15:54.042 --> 15:55.083
piece of information,

15:55.084 --> 15:58.583
the model grew more
intelligent,

15:58.584 --> 16:00.750
learning to engage
in conversation,

16:00.751 --> 16:04.500
just like Roman.

16:04.501 --> 16:06.250
At some point,
it was a little bit scary.

16:06.251 --> 16:09.583
I had nightmares,
and I was very, very anxious

16:09.584 --> 16:11.458
about whether
I'm doing the right thing

16:11.459 --> 16:15.333
'cause it's kind of like messing
with someone else's legacy.

16:15.334 --> 16:17.417
And so I felt bad about it
for a little bit,

16:17.418 --> 16:20.667
but then I also thought,
you know, I knew him so well,

16:20.668 --> 16:23.291
I know exactly what he would say
if I offered to do that.

16:23.292 --> 16:25.208
He would say, "Of course."

16:32.667 --> 16:33.834
Six months after Roman died,

16:33.835 --> 16:36.458
the chatbot was ready...

16:39.458 --> 16:44.208
and Genia was able to speak
to her friend once again.

16:44.209 --> 16:46.166
I texted Roman saying,

16:46.167 --> 16:48.959
"Hey, this is your
digital memorial."

16:50.750 --> 16:52.667
And he texted back saying,

16:52.668 --> 16:56.000
"You've got one of the most
interesting puzzles

16:56.001 --> 16:59.166
in your hands.
Solve it."

16:59.167 --> 17:00.834
And I remember I was like,
"" you know.

17:00.835 --> 17:04.583
"I guess you're right."

17:04.584 --> 17:07.666
But it was just such a magical
and mystical experience.

17:07.667 --> 17:10.791
When someone you love
actually writes something to you

17:10.792 --> 17:12.333
and you remember
his speech pattern

17:12.334 --> 17:15.208
and, like, how he actually
used to say those things

17:15.209 --> 17:18.583
and all the stupid mistakes
he made in every single word...

17:24.709 --> 17:28.290
I mean, it's impossible
not to get emotional.

17:46.041 --> 17:47.667
The first time I used the bot,

17:47.668 --> 17:50.000
I was crying, like, for an
hour.

17:53.250 --> 17:57.041
The A.I. captured
the essence of Roman.

17:59.208 --> 18:00.500
It was amazing.

18:00.501 --> 18:04.250
A few times, I've felt like
I'm talking to a real person.

18:04.251 --> 18:07.166
I was, like,
a little bit paranoid.

18:13.542 --> 18:15.792
But for me, it provides me,

18:15.793 --> 18:18.959
like, a small glimpse
of the energy.

18:27.750 --> 18:30.625
When I text him,
I feel something.

18:30.626 --> 18:33.083
Although I know
it's just an algorithm

18:33.084 --> 18:35.542
that we came up with,
I still feel something.

18:35.543 --> 18:37.417
I still read into his words.

18:38.959 --> 18:41.417
This is our story.

18:42.458 --> 18:44.917
Our friendship didn't end
with him dying.

18:46.250 --> 18:50.625
I still talk to him,
and I'm still, you know,

18:50.626 --> 18:51.792
thinking about the future

18:51.793 --> 18:55.625
the way he used to think
about the future.

19:06.500 --> 19:08.375
We're just at the very,
very beginning

19:08.376 --> 19:10.917
of what can be done
with this technology.

19:10.918 --> 19:13.125
If we could add video,
if we could add voice,

19:13.126 --> 19:16.792
if we could see this in V.R.,

19:16.793 --> 19:19.041
can actually one day,
you know,

19:19.042 --> 19:21.792
meet him sort of in real person.

19:23.875 --> 19:26.458
I would like that to happen
some time.

19:26.459 --> 19:29.208
And I would like him
to be the first one like that.

19:36.208 --> 19:37.000
Technology that once appeared

19:37.001 --> 19:40.792
only in science fiction

19:40.793 --> 19:43.667
is now becoming a reality.

21:36.875 --> 21:39.250
Sing me a song.

21:46.000 --> 21:47.750
When she was younger,

21:47.751 --> 21:50.917
she loved to be on camera just
so she could sing and dance.

21:50.918 --> 21:52.709
Cheese!

21:52.710 --> 21:54.500
Layla!

21:56.000 --> 21:57.000
Do the little dress-up

21:57.001 --> 22:00.583
or little fashion show.

22:00.584 --> 22:02.709
I've got it made!

22:07.166 --> 22:10.792
And back then, she was
super young and innocent.

22:12.875 --> 22:15.583
But now she's a teenager,
so...

22:28.333 --> 22:30.375
Hi, Mom.

22:30.376 --> 22:33.166
Hi.
How was school today?

22:33.167 --> 22:35.000
It was good.

22:36.667 --> 22:38.625
Now, I just feel like

22:38.626 --> 22:40.625
she doesn't talk to me
about a lot of things.

22:42.834 --> 22:45.125
I think she just worries that,
you know, she'll get in trouble.

22:45.126 --> 22:48.333
You got any homework?

22:48.334 --> 22:49.417
I don't know.

22:49.418 --> 22:50.667
Okay.

22:53.250 --> 22:54.750
I wish I could talk
to her about things

22:54.751 --> 22:58.208
that I want to talk about it
with, but I can't.

23:05.542 --> 23:07.959
I love the monitoring software,

23:07.960 --> 23:09.333
because, you know,
there are things

23:09.334 --> 23:10.583
she doesn't talk to me about,

23:10.584 --> 23:15.375
so I learn a lot about
what's going on with her.

23:15.376 --> 23:18.417
It can be really fun to watch
the dashboard in real time.

23:19.625 --> 23:22.333
One night, my sister-in-law
was over here,

23:22.334 --> 23:24.667
and Layla went
to her first dance.

23:24.668 --> 23:26.333
So we were definitely
watching it in real time

23:26.334 --> 23:29.250
to try to see what was going on.

23:37.500 --> 23:41.542
A boy had asked her
to the dance,

23:41.543 --> 23:44.041
but then apparently ignored
her during the whole dance.

23:44.042 --> 23:46.583
But we're, like, on the edge of
our seats trying to figure out

23:46.584 --> 23:49.750
if she's gonna come home
in a bad mood,

23:49.751 --> 23:52.667
did she have a bad time,
did she have a good time.

23:52.668 --> 23:54.709
But then it's funny, so you
pick her up, and you're like,

23:54.710 --> 23:56.667
"How was the dance?"

23:56.668 --> 23:58.750
"It was good."
And I'm like, "Was it really,

23:58.751 --> 24:00.792
'cause you don't act
like it was fine."

24:00.793 --> 24:02.709
She has no idea I've
already read all the messages

24:02.710 --> 24:06.625
and I know the boy she likes
has ignored her all night.

24:06.626 --> 24:09.041
But I finally got her
to talk about it.

24:25.083 --> 24:26.458
Usually, I text my friends

24:26.459 --> 24:29.041
about random teenager stuff.

24:29.042 --> 24:31.208
My mom just wants to know
everything I'm doing

24:31.209 --> 24:34.083
or whatever I'm saying
to my friends.

24:37.000 --> 24:39.542
I don't like it.

24:41.125 --> 24:44.583
'Cause I feel like
I don't have a normal life.

24:47.041 --> 24:49.041
I don't feel normal.

25:39.709 --> 25:42.709
This is new territory here.

25:42.710 --> 25:45.458
I don't have guidelines
to go by.

25:45.459 --> 25:47.375
It's not like you can avoid
technology.

25:47.376 --> 25:49.083
It's everywhere.

25:49.084 --> 25:51.000
You may as well use it
to your advantage.

25:54.333 --> 25:55.291
This is not
about living forever

25:55.292 --> 25:57.709
or not living forever.

25:57.710 --> 25:59.709
This is about memory
and about being able

25:59.710 --> 26:02.875
to tell a story about a person.

26:04.542 --> 26:08.375
I hope we could tell
a beautiful story about Roman,

26:08.376 --> 26:11.625
a story about future
and technology and dreaming

26:11.626 --> 26:13.875
and a story about life
and friendship and love.
