WEBVTT

00:02.900 --> 00:04.850
They've kidnapped Osgood

00:04.900 --> 00:06.850
and they've stolen the location
of every Zygon on Earth.

00:06.900 --> 00:10.850
- 'Doctor, the ceasefire's broken down.'
- Call me now.

00:10.900 --> 00:13.850
They turned into monsters
and they came for us.

00:13.900 --> 00:16.850
We couldn't fight 'em.
You can't tell who's who.

00:16.900 --> 00:20.850
Oh, come on. These are eggs
or pods or whatever. Look!

00:20.900 --> 00:22.850
God, that's me.

00:22.900 --> 00:24.850
But I don't see how these ARE duplicates.

00:24.900 --> 00:26.850
That's not how Zygons work.

00:26.900 --> 00:30.850
- These... ARE the humans!
- Please!

00:30.900 --> 00:32.850
Kill the traitors.

00:32.900 --> 00:35.500
There isn't any backup, is there?

00:40.900 --> 00:43.850
UNIT neutralised in the UK.

00:43.900 --> 00:45.850
More or less.

00:45.900 --> 00:49.900
I'm sorry, but Clara's dead.

00:51.000 --> 00:57.074

01:50.900 --> 01:54.900
Clara... Clara!

01:59.400 --> 02:01.340
You're breaking up!

02:03.900 --> 02:07.250
'The invasion has happened. You're
probably surrounded by Zygons.

02:07.300 --> 02:07.890
'Get to the TARDIS,

02:07.940 --> 02:08.850
'get yourself safe.

02:08.900 --> 02:11.850
'Apparently my plane
is never going to land.

02:11.900 --> 02:13.850
'Let's see what we can do about that!'

02:13.900 --> 02:17.900
'I'm sorry, but Clara's dead.'

02:52.900 --> 02:54.640
Dream checks...

02:58.900 --> 03:01.300
Dream checks, dream checks...

03:01.900 --> 03:04.300
'It's your decision, Doctor.

03:08.900 --> 03:11.900
'Truth or consequences.'

03:22.900 --> 03:24.370
Doctor...

03:27.900 --> 03:29.900
Missed!

05:42.900 --> 05:44.900
I know what you are.

05:45.900 --> 05:47.850
Please... Please.

05:47.900 --> 05:50.170
I'm going to set you free.

05:53.900 --> 05:56.850
Humans cannot accept
the way we really are.

05:56.900 --> 05:58.850
If we cannot hide, we must fight.

05:58.900 --> 06:00.850
You are going to be the first.

06:00.900 --> 06:03.900
The first to make the humans see.

06:29.900 --> 06:31.850
Help me.

06:31.900 --> 06:34.850
Help me...

06:34.900 --> 06:37.900
Help! Help me...

06:56.900 --> 06:58.850
Commander here. The first
one has been changed.

06:58.900 --> 07:02.900
I'm going to UNIT to
retrieve the Osgood box.

07:40.900 --> 07:42.900
Doctor?

07:43.900 --> 07:45.240
Doctor!

07:52.850 --> 07:53.850
Any questions?

07:53.900 --> 07:56.850
Why do you have a Union Jack parachute?

07:56.900 --> 07:58.850
- Camouflage.
- Camouflage?

07:58.900 --> 08:00.850
Yes, we're in Britain.

08:00.900 --> 08:01.850
Ooh, your specs are broken.

08:01.900 --> 08:04.850
I'll fix 'em. You can
wear mine, they're sonic.

08:04.900 --> 08:05.850
- Sonic specs?
- Yeah!

08:05.900 --> 08:07.850
Isn't that a bit pointless?

08:07.900 --> 08:08.850
Like a visual hearing aid?

08:08.900 --> 08:10.850
What's wrong with pointless?

08:10.900 --> 08:12.850
I once invented an invisible watch.

08:12.900 --> 08:14.850
Spot the design flaw.

08:14.900 --> 08:17.850
You're talking nonsense to distract
me from being really scared.

08:17.900 --> 08:20.850
It's one of your known character traits.

08:20.900 --> 08:22.850
Don't look at my browser history.

08:22.900 --> 08:23.850
Whoa!

08:23.900 --> 08:25.970
Yeah, I said "don't".

08:34.900 --> 08:37.850
Why didn't that Zygon blow
us up with her big bazooka?

08:37.900 --> 08:39.850
She did blow us up with her big bazooka.

08:39.900 --> 08:41.850
This is us being blown
up with a big bazooka.

08:41.900 --> 08:43.850
But she seems to know what she's doing.

08:43.900 --> 08:45.850
The first thing I'D do if I
wanted to invade the world

08:45.900 --> 08:47.850
- would be to kill you.
- Thanks.

08:47.900 --> 08:49.850
I wouldn't even let you get
talking, like you always do.

08:49.900 --> 08:52.850
- Bullet between the eyes, first thing.
- Again, thank you.

08:52.900 --> 08:54.850
- 12 times, if necessary.
- Ah, yes. Why limit yourself?

08:54.900 --> 08:56.850
You've really thought
this through, haven't you?

08:56.900 --> 08:57.850
I'm a big fan.

08:57.900 --> 09:00.850
But she gave you a chance
to get out. She hesitated.

09:00.900 --> 09:02.850
If she had Clara's memory print,

09:02.900 --> 09:05.900
she'd know better than
to give you even a second.

09:06.900 --> 09:09.850
You've gone quiet because
I mentioned Clara.

09:09.900 --> 09:10.850
You think she might be dead.

09:10.900 --> 09:12.850
Yes.

09:12.900 --> 09:14.850
Are you OK?

09:14.900 --> 09:17.850
I don't know. I'm still in the hope phase.

09:17.900 --> 09:19.850
- How's that going?
- Hell.

09:19.900 --> 09:22.500
Please talk about something else.

09:40.900 --> 09:43.850
Why do they want to destroy the ceasefire?

09:43.900 --> 09:44.850
Don't think of them as rational.

09:44.900 --> 09:47.850
They're different. They don't
care about human beings,

09:47.900 --> 09:50.850
they don't care about their own people.

09:50.900 --> 09:52.850
They think the rest of
Zygonkind are traitors.

09:52.900 --> 09:54.970
It's a splinter group.

09:57.900 --> 09:59.850
Clara.

09:59.900 --> 10:00.850
Well, not Clara. The Zygon who...

10:00.900 --> 10:03.900
The Zygon who probably
killed her. Read it.

10:04.900 --> 10:06.850
- It says, "I'm awake."
- What does she mean?

10:06.900 --> 10:08.850
A political awakening?

10:08.900 --> 10:10.850
Why would she be sending me propaganda?

10:10.900 --> 10:12.850
She just blew me up with a big bazooka.

10:12.900 --> 10:15.900
Never really met Clara.
Pretty strong, yeah?

10:16.850 --> 10:17.850
She was amazing.

10:17.900 --> 10:19.850
No.

10:19.900 --> 10:21.850
Not was. Is.

10:21.900 --> 10:24.850
It's not from the Zygon. It's from Clara.

10:24.900 --> 10:25.850
How?

10:25.900 --> 10:27.850
She's not dead, she's in a pod somewhere.

10:27.900 --> 10:30.850
They need a live feed to the
information in her brain.

10:30.900 --> 10:31.850
But she's fighting back.

10:31.900 --> 10:34.850
- She's trying to take control,
piece by piece. - Texting?

10:34.900 --> 10:36.850
How much more human do you get?

10:36.900 --> 10:38.860
The Zygon probably doesn't
even know it sent this,

10:38.900 --> 10:40.850
or why it misfired that bazooka.

10:40.900 --> 10:42.850
You don't know. It's just a theory.

10:42.900 --> 10:43.850
Yes, it's just a theory.

10:43.900 --> 10:46.900
But how's the hope phase now?

10:47.900 --> 10:51.100
- Worse than ever.
- Then we've got a game!

11:38.900 --> 11:42.850
Hello. If you're watching this, I
have been captured and interrogated.

11:42.900 --> 11:44.850
During the interrogation,
I have revealed to you

11:44.900 --> 11:46.850
the existence of the Osgood box.

11:46.900 --> 11:49.850
I have revealed its location and
the combination to open this safe.

11:49.900 --> 11:50.850
And guess what?

11:50.900 --> 11:52.850
I lied.

11:52.900 --> 11:54.850
The Osgood box exists.

11:54.900 --> 11:57.900
But it's not here. Stop
looking. Really, stop.

11:58.900 --> 12:00.850
The Osgood box can end the ceasefire.

12:00.900 --> 12:03.850
The Osgood box can start the war.

12:03.900 --> 12:05.850
The Osgood box can wipe out all humankind.

12:05.900 --> 12:08.850
But there's a reason it's
called the Osgood box.

12:08.900 --> 12:10.900
Haven't you guessed?

12:18.900 --> 12:20.900
Hello! Hi!

12:22.900 --> 12:24.850
Hello.

12:24.900 --> 12:26.850
Dr John Disco.

12:26.900 --> 12:27.850
It was my plane.

12:27.900 --> 12:30.850
I had a big plane

12:30.900 --> 12:33.370
for purposes of poncing about.

12:35.900 --> 12:37.850
It went off with a massive bang

12:37.900 --> 12:40.240
about half a mile that way?

12:42.900 --> 12:44.440
Actually...

12:46.900 --> 12:49.850
- It's fine. We're... we're
fine, aren't we? - Yeah. Yeah.

12:49.900 --> 12:52.900
Yes, yes, we're fine.
Just, um, move along.

12:53.900 --> 12:55.370
(Come on.)

13:00.900 --> 13:02.900
She's answered.

13:04.900 --> 13:06.850
- Hello!
- You're dead.

13:06.900 --> 13:07.850
Yes, well, I'm dead now,

13:07.900 --> 13:11.850
and I think I might be a
bit more dead in a minute.

13:11.900 --> 13:12.850
What's your plan, Zygella?

13:12.900 --> 13:14.850
I don't have a plan.

13:14.900 --> 13:16.850
Come on, you don't invade planets
without having kind of plan.

13:16.900 --> 13:19.850
That's why they're called "planets"
...to remind you to PLAN IT?

13:19.900 --> 13:22.850
Hey-hey! That's good!
Pun-tastic. Dr Pun-tastic!

13:22.900 --> 13:25.850
Oh, come on, that was a good one, Zygella!

13:25.900 --> 13:27.850
Don't call me Zygella.

13:27.900 --> 13:29.850
My name's Bonnie.

13:29.900 --> 13:31.850
And you're winking at me.

13:31.900 --> 13:33.850
I am not winking at you.

13:33.900 --> 13:36.100
Where is the Osgood box?

13:37.900 --> 13:40.850
You do know what winking means?

13:40.900 --> 13:42.850
You're sending out some
very mixed messages here.

13:42.900 --> 13:44.850
You know I'm over 2,000 years old?

13:44.900 --> 13:46.850
I'm old enough to be your Messiah.

13:46.900 --> 13:49.850
'I am not winking at
you. Where is the box?!'

13:49.900 --> 13:52.850
We need some wheels. The van!

13:52.900 --> 13:54.850
OK. Non-verbal communication.

13:54.900 --> 13:57.850
I assume that you never
bothered to learn Morse code...

13:57.900 --> 13:59.850
(Specs! Setting 137.)

13:59.900 --> 14:00.850
Tell me!

14:00.900 --> 14:02.850
OK, we'll have to try
something else. 20 questions.

14:02.900 --> 14:04.850
Where's your pod?

14:04.900 --> 14:05.850
Is it in a tunnel?

14:05.900 --> 14:07.850
Is it in London?

14:07.900 --> 14:10.100
Thanks very much. Gotcha!

14:12.900 --> 14:15.850
'Stay where you are, Clara.'
We're coming to get you.

14:15.900 --> 14:17.850
And for God's sake, don't
let her into your memories!

14:17.900 --> 14:20.850
Memories? What memories? What has she got?

14:20.900 --> 14:22.850
Don't tell her where the Osgood box is,

14:22.900 --> 14:25.900
and above all, don't tell her WHAT it is.

14:35.900 --> 14:38.850
- Obviously, the Zygon could
hear that. - Obviously.

14:38.900 --> 14:42.850
So she's going to poke around inside
Clara's mind, looking for answers.

14:42.900 --> 14:46.850
The mind of Clara Oswald. She
may never find her way out!

14:46.900 --> 14:50.300
I don't think I've ever
seen you smile before.

14:51.850 --> 14:52.850
Dazzling, isn't it?

14:52.900 --> 14:55.850
Oh! I got a ping on Clara's phone.

14:55.900 --> 14:57.850
It's the location Bonnie
sent the text from.

14:57.900 --> 14:58.850
A shopping centre, south London.

14:58.900 --> 15:02.850
Ah, London! Perpetual city,
cradle of culture, here we come!

15:02.900 --> 15:04.850
Clara, stay safe.

15:04.900 --> 15:07.900
She's posted a video link.

15:09.900 --> 15:12.850
'A video supposedly showing
an alien in south London

15:12.900 --> 15:14.850
'is posted across the internet...'

15:14.900 --> 15:18.900
This is the same place Bonnie
texted from. We need to hurry.

15:45.900 --> 15:47.170
Hello.

15:50.900 --> 15:52.850
Oh, there's no point turning over.

15:52.900 --> 15:55.850
There's nothing better on the other side.

15:55.900 --> 15:57.850
I could erase your mind.

15:57.900 --> 15:59.970
Then why haven't you?

16:03.900 --> 16:05.900
Having trouble?

16:07.900 --> 16:10.100
Let's see what I can do.

16:19.900 --> 16:23.850
See, this thing... works
two ways, you know.

16:23.900 --> 16:27.850
I want those memories! Trouble
is, you're asking me for them,

16:27.900 --> 16:30.850
which means you can't access them, right?

16:30.900 --> 16:31.850
I can make you tell me.

16:31.900 --> 16:34.850
No, you can't, otherwise
you would have done already.

16:34.900 --> 16:36.900
I can kill you.

16:39.900 --> 16:42.850
- Go on, then.
- You think you're calling my bluff.

16:42.900 --> 16:44.850
I AM calling your bluff.

16:44.900 --> 16:45.850
You need me alive.

16:45.900 --> 16:47.850
Only as a source of information.

16:47.900 --> 16:50.850
- Then you'd better start asking questions.
- You'd better not lie.

16:50.900 --> 16:52.850
You see, that's your problem.

16:52.900 --> 16:55.850
I am a brilliant liar. How
are you ever going to know?

16:55.900 --> 16:56.850
Oh, Clara.

16:56.900 --> 16:59.900
For a moment, I thought you were clever.

17:03.900 --> 17:06.849
Our hearts are linked. Beat for beat.

17:06.900 --> 17:09.849
The one thing you and I can never do

17:09.900 --> 17:11.970
is lie to each other.

17:13.900 --> 17:16.440
Oh, that scared you, didn't it?

17:24.900 --> 17:26.900
London!

17:27.900 --> 17:29.850
What a dump.

17:29.900 --> 17:31.850
- London's OK.
- No, it's not, it's a dump.

17:31.900 --> 17:34.850
You spend an awful lot of time
here, considering it's a dump.

17:34.900 --> 17:37.850
I spend an awful lot of time
being kidnapped, tortured,

17:37.900 --> 17:40.850
shot at and exterminated.
Doesn't mean I like it.

17:40.900 --> 17:42.850
Well... This is where the video was shot.

17:42.900 --> 17:44.850
Bonnie was here.

17:44.900 --> 17:46.700
Come on, Doctor.

17:57.850 --> 17:58.850
There's electricity in the air.

17:58.900 --> 18:02.900
It stinks. It smells like... barbecues.

18:10.900 --> 18:12.170
Oh...

18:18.900 --> 18:20.850
Now, listen to me. Here's
what we're going to do.

18:20.900 --> 18:22.850
I'm going to ask you questions

18:22.900 --> 18:25.850
and if you don't tell me the
exact and complete truth,

18:25.900 --> 18:28.850
I will know and I WILL kill
you. Do you understand me?

18:28.900 --> 18:30.100
Yes.

18:31.900 --> 18:33.850
I will slaughter you
in that pod right now.

18:33.900 --> 18:35.900
Am I lying to you?

18:37.900 --> 18:39.850
- No.
- Good. Then we'll begin.

18:39.900 --> 18:42.100
Where is the Osgood box?

18:42.900 --> 18:44.850
You will answer me, Clara.

18:44.900 --> 18:49.850
Truth or consequences, lie
and you die. Where is it?

18:49.900 --> 18:51.850
UNIT HQ. Under the Tower of London.

18:51.900 --> 18:55.850
- Where, specifically? - The
Black Archive. - Ah, yes.

18:55.900 --> 18:59.850
The dark little storage facility
for forbidden alien tech,

18:59.900 --> 19:02.850
where this all began.
Who has access to it?

19:02.900 --> 19:04.850
The Osgoods.

19:04.900 --> 19:05.850
Only the Osgoods?

19:05.900 --> 19:08.850
The Doctor sealed it
up after the last time.

19:08.900 --> 19:10.850
Didn't want UNIT interfering
with the ceasefire.

19:10.900 --> 19:13.900
Don't avoid the question. Do
only the Osgoods have access?

19:14.900 --> 19:16.850
The Doctor has access, too.

19:16.900 --> 19:18.900
Who else?

19:20.900 --> 19:22.900
Ah. You.

19:23.900 --> 19:26.900
YOU have access?

19:28.850 --> 19:29.850
Yes.

19:29.900 --> 19:31.850
Is it a key? Or a code?

19:31.900 --> 19:33.850
No, a pass. A key code?

19:33.900 --> 19:35.900
Give it to me now.

19:37.900 --> 19:39.300
I can't.

19:40.900 --> 19:43.850
Interesting. You're not lying.

19:43.900 --> 19:46.850
- No, I'm not. - But you have
access of some kind. - Obviously.

19:46.900 --> 19:48.850
- Give it to me now.
- I told you. I can't.

19:48.900 --> 19:51.850
You KNOW I'm not lying,
I can't give you access.

19:51.900 --> 19:53.850
OK, how do you get in there?

19:53.900 --> 19:55.850
How, physically, do you get in?

19:55.900 --> 19:58.900
- It's automatic.
- But how? Tell me!

20:00.900 --> 20:02.850
The door is keyed to my body print.

20:02.900 --> 20:06.850
Ah, yes, your body print.

20:06.900 --> 20:09.850
You can't give me access,
because I have access already.

20:09.900 --> 20:11.850
- I'm you.
- Yes.

20:11.900 --> 20:14.900
And what am I going to find?
What's in the Osgood box?

20:17.900 --> 20:19.900
Clara?

20:21.900 --> 20:23.850
The box ends the ceasefire.

20:23.900 --> 20:25.850
So I'm told. How?

20:25.900 --> 20:27.850
There's a button inside the box.

20:27.900 --> 20:29.850
Press it, it will transmit a signal

20:29.900 --> 20:32.850
that will unmask every Zygon
on the planet for up to an hour.

20:32.900 --> 20:35.850
What's there to smile about?

20:35.900 --> 20:37.850
Mass panic followed by a war.

20:37.900 --> 20:40.850
Every Zygon on our side at a stroke.

20:40.900 --> 20:45.850
20 million Zygons against
seven billion humans --

20:45.900 --> 20:48.850
that's not a war you can win.

20:48.900 --> 20:52.850
Then we will die in the fire,
instead of living in chains.

20:52.900 --> 20:54.850
Most of your own kind don't want that.

20:54.900 --> 20:56.850
Then it's time we stopped
giving them a choice.

20:56.900 --> 20:59.900
It's time you asked the
most important question.

21:02.900 --> 21:05.240
- Which is?
- I'm waiting.

21:05.900 --> 21:08.370
Why's it called an Osgood box?

21:09.900 --> 21:11.850
- I'm not telling you.
- Good.

21:11.900 --> 21:14.850
I've been looking forward
to hearing you scream.

21:14.900 --> 21:16.850
I'm not telling you, because when
you get to the Black Archive,

21:16.900 --> 21:19.850
you'll find out for
yourself, and when you do,

21:19.900 --> 21:22.900
you're going to want to speak to me again.

21:23.900 --> 21:25.850
Am I lying to you?

21:31.900 --> 21:33.570
See you later.

21:36.900 --> 21:38.900
What's your name?

21:39.850 --> 21:40.850
Osgood.

21:40.900 --> 21:42.850
No, no, no. Your first name?

21:42.900 --> 21:45.040
What's YOUR first name?

21:47.400 --> 21:48.670
Basil.

21:52.900 --> 21:54.440
Petronella.

21:56.900 --> 21:59.900
Let's just stick with what we had.

22:01.900 --> 22:03.850
I need to ask you...

22:03.900 --> 22:05.850
.. because it's important,

22:05.900 --> 22:08.850
because it might matter...

22:08.900 --> 22:10.850
What's important?

22:10.900 --> 22:13.570
Which one are you? Human or Zygon?

22:30.900 --> 22:33.500
Whoever you are, we can help you.

22:34.900 --> 22:36.570
It wasn't me.

22:37.900 --> 22:39.850
They attacked me.

22:39.900 --> 22:42.100
They saw me. I had to...

22:43.900 --> 22:46.850
It's OK, it's OK, it's
OK. It's OK, it's OK.

22:46.900 --> 22:51.850
A commander came. She turned me back!

22:53.900 --> 22:56.300
We can help. We can help you.

22:56.900 --> 23:00.700
- Doctor, we can help him, can't we?
- I'm not sure.

23:02.850 --> 23:03.850
Please!

23:03.900 --> 23:06.900
Come back! Come back!

23:11.900 --> 23:15.850
North America reporting
back to High Command.

23:15.900 --> 23:17.850
I'm going to the Black Archive.

23:17.900 --> 23:19.850
- I'll open it up, you will follow.
- Of course.

23:19.900 --> 23:22.850
But first, locate the Doctor.
If possible, duplicate him,

23:22.900 --> 23:24.850
and then kill him.

23:24.900 --> 23:27.040
It will be my pleasure.

23:34.900 --> 23:37.500
I can't help you just now, but...

23:39.850 --> 23:40.850
Why?

23:40.900 --> 23:44.900
- I was happy like this. I was
happy here. - I understand.

23:46.900 --> 23:49.850
I can't change. I can't hide.

23:49.900 --> 23:50.850
Let us help you.

23:50.900 --> 23:52.850
No!

23:52.900 --> 23:55.850
You're truth or consequences.

23:56.900 --> 23:59.300
We're not. We're really not.

24:01.900 --> 24:03.850
I'm not part of your fight.

24:03.900 --> 24:05.850
I never wanted to fight anyone,

24:05.900 --> 24:07.850
I just wanted to live here.

24:07.900 --> 24:11.850
Why can't I just live?

24:11.900 --> 24:13.850
We're on your side.

24:13.900 --> 24:16.100
I'm not on anyone's side.

24:18.900 --> 24:21.850
This is my home.

24:21.900 --> 24:24.850
Listen, we are not them.

24:24.900 --> 24:26.900
I can't go back now.

24:27.900 --> 24:30.850
You've taken my life!

24:30.900 --> 24:33.300
No, no, no! Stop! Stop! Stop!

24:36.900 --> 24:38.900
They will kill me.

24:51.900 --> 24:54.900
There it is, Osgood. There's their plan.

24:55.900 --> 24:58.850
Unmask everyone, provoke fear,

24:58.900 --> 25:00.850
paranoia, provoke a war.

25:00.900 --> 25:04.850
- Doctor...
- Kate! Are you all right?

25:04.900 --> 25:06.850
- Of course I am. Why wouldn't I be?
- It's just I'd heard otherwise.

25:06.900 --> 25:09.850
I'm fine. Doctor, we know where
the Zygon command centre is.

25:09.900 --> 25:12.850
We know where Clara's pod
is. We can take you there.

25:12.900 --> 25:13.850
Well, how very convenient,

25:13.900 --> 25:16.900
because that's just exactly
what we're looking for.

25:19.900 --> 25:22.900
And here it is, the Black Archive.

25:23.900 --> 25:25.850
Oh, I do like being you, Clara.

25:25.900 --> 25:28.850
Everyone just waves you on past.

25:28.900 --> 25:31.900
Now, how does this work?

25:57.900 --> 25:59.850
Well, they like a good cave, don't they?

25:59.900 --> 26:02.850
How many of these pods are occupied?

26:02.900 --> 26:03.850
We don't know.

26:03.900 --> 26:05.970
Which one is Clara's?

26:07.900 --> 26:09.850
Well, that's strange. It was here before.

26:09.900 --> 26:11.850
Doctor...

26:11.900 --> 26:14.040
I think they're Zygons.

26:16.900 --> 26:19.370
Oh, you tricky little monkeys!

26:21.900 --> 26:24.850
Normalise.

26:38.900 --> 26:41.900
Well, Clara, I think you're
reaching the end of your...

26:50.900 --> 26:52.850
The Doctor is here.

26:52.900 --> 26:54.850
'Don't kill him. We need him alive.'

26:54.900 --> 26:55.850
What for?

26:55.900 --> 26:59.900
Because I just found out why
it's called an Osgood box.

27:00.900 --> 27:03.850
- There's two of them.
- Two Osgoods, two boxes.

27:03.900 --> 27:06.770
Operation Double. What did you expect?

27:08.900 --> 27:12.850
What's in them, Doctor? Tell me. Now!

27:12.900 --> 27:14.850
One box normalises all the Zygons.

27:14.900 --> 27:17.570
- And the other?
- Destroys them.

27:19.900 --> 27:21.850
Which is which?

27:21.900 --> 27:23.970
That would be telling!

27:47.900 --> 27:49.850
Which box normalises the Zygons, Doctor?

27:49.900 --> 27:51.850
Tell me, or she dies.

27:51.900 --> 27:54.850
No. This is war. You pull the
trigger, you pay the price.

27:54.900 --> 27:56.850
Kill her.

27:56.900 --> 27:58.850
The blue one!

27:58.900 --> 28:01.900
The blue one! The blue one
normalises all your people.

28:05.900 --> 28:08.850
Are you lying? Are you
lying to me, Doctor?

28:08.900 --> 28:09.850
No, I'm not.

28:09.900 --> 28:12.900
And when you open up the box,
you'll see I'm not lying.

28:17.900 --> 28:19.240
Doctor?

28:22.900 --> 28:24.900
Doctor!

28:25.900 --> 28:27.850
Yeah, I know.

28:27.900 --> 28:30.900
Bring him to me!

28:38.900 --> 28:40.850
- Sorry, Doctor! Self-defence.
- You're you!

28:40.900 --> 28:43.900
- I'm me.
- How did you survive?

28:51.900 --> 28:53.850
Five rounds' rapid.

28:55.900 --> 28:59.850
I'm sorry, Doctor, I
know you don't approve.

28:59.900 --> 29:03.200
Why does peacekeeping
always involve killing?

29:04.900 --> 29:06.850
Is this the lot?

29:06.900 --> 29:08.850
No, there are plenty more of them.

29:08.900 --> 29:10.970
They were the nearest.

29:11.900 --> 29:13.850
You are you? I'm me.

29:13.900 --> 29:15.850
But human or Zygon?

29:15.900 --> 29:17.850
Me.

29:17.900 --> 29:18.850
What are we dealing with?

29:18.900 --> 29:21.850
20 million Zygons about to be unmasked.

29:21.900 --> 29:23.850
You don't know whether
they are human or not.

29:23.900 --> 29:26.850
And you can't fight
them, not with soldiers.

29:26.900 --> 29:28.850
Which leads me to a very big question.

29:28.900 --> 29:30.850
I was really hoping that it wouldn't.

29:30.900 --> 29:32.850
The Z-67, Sullivan's gas, the
gas that kills the Zygons.

29:32.900 --> 29:36.850
- So you took it. - Well, you
know how it is. Daddy knows best.

29:36.900 --> 29:39.570
That's what's in the red box, yes?

29:39.850 --> 29:40.850
Of course it is.

29:40.900 --> 29:43.850
If I remember rightly,
it causes a chain reaction

29:43.900 --> 29:45.850
in the atmosphere, turns every
Zygon on Earth inside-out.

29:45.900 --> 29:48.850
Let me negotiate peace. You
can't commit mass murder...

29:48.900 --> 29:50.850
Then why did you leave the gas with us?

29:50.900 --> 29:52.850
The boxes are safeguards for both species.

29:52.900 --> 29:54.850
- You agreed to that.
- I never agreed to that.

29:54.900 --> 29:56.850
Yes, you did, then I wiped your memory.

29:56.900 --> 29:59.850
You agreed to that, too. But
that's why there were two Osgoods

29:59.900 --> 30:02.850
to police the ceasefire.
One human and one Zygon,

30:02.900 --> 30:05.850
to keep the secrets and keep the peace.

30:05.900 --> 30:07.850
I'm sorry, Doctor.

30:07.900 --> 30:10.900
Truly. But the peace is failing already.

30:13.900 --> 30:15.900
Come on.

30:28.900 --> 30:31.900
It's no good, Bonnie, you can't win.

30:34.900 --> 30:36.850
I don't care.

30:36.900 --> 30:40.850
Hi! Hello! Hello! Oh, hello!

30:40.900 --> 30:43.850
Hi. Hi. Stop this. Stop this, please.

30:43.900 --> 30:45.850
Let me take both of these boxes away.

30:45.900 --> 30:48.850
We'll forgive, we'll forget.

30:48.900 --> 30:50.850
And the ceasefire will stand.

30:50.900 --> 30:52.900
No.

30:57.900 --> 30:59.850
Doctor, which of these buttons do I press?

30:59.900 --> 31:01.850
Doctor, which one? Truth or consequences?

31:01.900 --> 31:04.900
Truth or consequences?

31:10.900 --> 31:12.850
This is the moment we've
all been waiting for.

31:12.900 --> 31:14.850
Make-your-mind-up time!

31:14.900 --> 31:17.850
One of those buttons
will destroy the Zygons,

31:17.900 --> 31:19.850
release the imbecile's gas.

31:19.900 --> 31:22.850
The other one detonates the nuclear
warhead under the Black Archive.

31:22.900 --> 31:24.850
It'll destroy everyone in London.

31:24.900 --> 31:28.850
Bonnie. Bonnie, sweetheart!

31:28.900 --> 31:32.850
One of those buttons will
unmask every Zygon in the world.

31:32.900 --> 31:36.850
The other one cancels their
ability to change form.

31:36.900 --> 31:39.850
It'll make them human beings for ever.

31:39.900 --> 31:41.850
There are safeguards beyond safeguards.

31:41.900 --> 31:44.850
I did this on a very important day for me

31:44.900 --> 31:46.850
- and this ceasefire WILL stand.
- This is wrong.

31:46.900 --> 31:48.850
No, it's not.

31:48.900 --> 31:51.850
You are responsible for all the
violence. All of the suffering.

31:51.900 --> 31:52.850
- No, I'm not. - Yes. - No.

31:52.900 --> 31:57.850
Yes, you engineered this situation,
Doctor. This is your fault.

31:57.900 --> 31:59.850
No, it's not, it's your fault.
I had to do what I've done.

31:59.900 --> 32:02.850
- So did I.
- We have been treated like cattle.

32:02.900 --> 32:04.850
- So, what? - We've been
left to fend for ourselves.

32:04.900 --> 32:08.850
- So is everyone. - It's not
fair. - Oh, it's not fair!

32:08.900 --> 32:12.850
Oh, I didn't realise that it
was not fair! You know what?

32:12.900 --> 32:14.850
My TARDIS doesn't work properly

32:14.900 --> 32:16.850
and I don't have my own personal tailor.

32:16.900 --> 32:18.850
The things don't equate.

32:18.900 --> 32:21.850
These things have happened,
Zygella, they are facts.

32:21.900 --> 32:24.850
YOU just want cruelty to beget cruelty.

32:24.900 --> 32:28.850
You're not superior to
people who were cruel to you,

32:28.900 --> 32:31.900
you're just a whole bunch
of new cruel people.

32:32.900 --> 32:35.850
A whole bunch of new cruel people

32:35.900 --> 32:37.850
being cruel to some other people,

32:37.900 --> 32:39.850
who'll end up being cruel to you.

32:39.900 --> 32:42.850
The only way anyone can live in peace

32:42.900 --> 32:45.570
is if they're prepared to forgive.

32:47.900 --> 32:50.370
Why don't you break the cycle?

32:50.900 --> 32:52.900
Why should we?

32:57.900 --> 33:00.570
What is it that you actually want?

33:06.900 --> 33:09.040
- War.
- Ah, ah right!

33:10.900 --> 33:13.850
And when this war is over,

33:13.900 --> 33:16.850
when you have a homeland free from humans,

33:16.900 --> 33:19.850
what do you think it's going to be like?

33:19.900 --> 33:20.850
Do you know? Have you thought about it?

33:20.900 --> 33:22.850
Have you given it any consideration?

33:22.900 --> 33:25.850
Because you're very close
to getting what you want.

33:25.900 --> 33:28.850
What's it going to be
like? Paint me a picture.

33:28.900 --> 33:32.850
Are you going to live in houses?
Do you want people to go to work?

33:32.900 --> 33:33.850
Will there be holidays?

33:33.900 --> 33:35.850
Oh! Will there be music?

33:35.900 --> 33:38.850
Do you think people will
be allowed to play violins?

33:38.900 --> 33:40.850
Who's going to make the violins?

33:40.900 --> 33:43.850
Well? Oh, you don't actually know, do you?

33:43.900 --> 33:48.850
Because, like every other
tantrumming child in history,

33:48.900 --> 33:51.850
Bonnie, you don't actually
know what you want.

33:51.900 --> 33:55.850
So, let me ask you a question about
this brave new world of yours.

33:55.900 --> 33:59.850
When you've killed all the bad
guys, and when it's all perfect

33:59.900 --> 34:02.850
and just and fair, when
you have finally got it

34:02.900 --> 34:04.850
exactly the way you want it,

34:04.900 --> 34:07.900
what are you going to do
with the people like you?

34:09.900 --> 34:11.900
The troublemakers.

34:13.900 --> 34:16.850
How are you going to protect
your glorious revolution

34:16.900 --> 34:18.900
from the next one?

34:19.900 --> 34:21.850
We'll win.

34:21.900 --> 34:25.850
Oh, will you? Well,
maybe... maybe you WILL win!

34:25.900 --> 34:28.850
But nobody wins for long.

34:28.900 --> 34:31.900
The wheel just keeps turning.

34:33.850 --> 34:34.850
So, come on.

34:34.900 --> 34:36.850
Break the cycle.

34:36.900 --> 34:39.850
Why are you still talking?

34:39.900 --> 34:42.850
Because I want to get you to
see, and I'm almost there!

34:42.900 --> 34:45.300
You know what I see, Doctor?

34:46.900 --> 34:48.850
A box.

34:48.900 --> 34:50.850
A box with everything I need.

34:50.900 --> 34:52.850
A 50% chance.

34:52.900 --> 34:54.900
For us, too.

34:55.900 --> 34:59.850
And we're off! Fingers on
buzzers! Are you feeling lucky?

34:59.900 --> 35:01.850
Are you ready to play the game?
Who's going to be quickest?

35:01.900 --> 35:04.850
- Who's going to be luckiest?
- This is not a game!

35:04.900 --> 35:07.850
No, it's not a game, sweetheart,
and I mean that most sincerely.

35:07.900 --> 35:08.850
Why are you doing this?

35:08.900 --> 35:11.850
Yes, I'd quite like to know that,
too. You set this up -- why?

35:11.900 --> 35:14.370
Because it's not a game, Kate.

35:15.900 --> 35:17.850
This is a scale model of war.

35:17.900 --> 35:21.850
Every war ever fought, right
there in front of you.

35:21.900 --> 35:23.850
Because it's always the same.

35:23.900 --> 35:26.850
When you fire that first shot,
no matter how right you feel,

35:26.900 --> 35:30.850
you have no idea who's going to die!

35:30.900 --> 35:34.900
You don't know whose children
are going to scream and burn!

35:36.900 --> 35:39.440
How many hearts will be broken!

35:39.900 --> 35:41.850
How many lives shattered!

35:41.900 --> 35:44.850
How much blood will spill
until everybody does until

35:44.900 --> 35:47.850
what they were always going to have
to do from the very beginning --

35:47.900 --> 35:49.770
sit down and talk!

35:52.900 --> 35:56.900
Listen to me. Listen, I just...
I just want you to think.

35:58.900 --> 36:00.850
Do you know what thinking is?

36:00.900 --> 36:02.850
It's a fancy word for changing your mind.

36:02.900 --> 36:05.850
I will not change my mind.

36:05.900 --> 36:07.850
Then you will die stupid.

36:07.900 --> 36:11.850
Alternatively, you could
step away from that box,

36:11.900 --> 36:13.850
you can walk right out of that door

36:13.900 --> 36:16.850
and you could stand your revolution down.

36:16.900 --> 36:18.850
No!

36:18.900 --> 36:21.850
I'm not stopping this, Doctor. I
started it. I will not stop it.

36:21.900 --> 36:24.850
You think they'll let me
go, after what I've done?

36:24.900 --> 36:26.850
You're all the same, you screaming kids.

36:26.900 --> 36:28.850
You know that?

36:28.900 --> 36:29.850
"Look at me, I'm unforgiveable."

36:29.900 --> 36:33.850
Well, here's the
unforeseeable. I forgive you...

36:33.900 --> 36:35.970
after all you've done.

36:36.900 --> 36:38.900
I forgive you.

36:41.900 --> 36:43.970
You don't understand.

36:45.900 --> 36:48.850
You will never understand.

36:48.900 --> 36:49.850
I don't understand?

36:49.900 --> 36:52.850
Are you kidding? Me?
Of course I understand.

36:52.900 --> 36:56.850
You mean, you call this a
war? This funny little thing?

36:56.900 --> 36:57.850
This is not a war!

36:57.900 --> 37:00.850
I fought in a bigger war
than you will ever know.

37:00.900 --> 37:03.850
I did worse things than
you could ever imagine.

37:03.900 --> 37:06.240
And when I close my eyes...

37:06.900 --> 37:10.850
.. I hear more screams than anyone
could ever be able to count!

37:10.900 --> 37:13.850
And do you know what you
do with all that pain?

37:13.900 --> 37:15.850
Shall I tell you where you put it?

37:15.900 --> 37:17.900
You hold it tight...

37:19.850 --> 37:20.850
.. till it burns your hand,

37:20.900 --> 37:22.900
and you say this...

37:24.900 --> 37:28.850
No-one else will ever
have to live like this!

37:28.900 --> 37:31.850
No-one else will have to feel this pain!

37:31.900 --> 37:33.700
Not on my watch!

37:46.900 --> 37:49.900
Thank you.

37:51.900 --> 37:53.850
I'm sorry.

37:53.900 --> 37:55.850
I know.

37:55.900 --> 37:57.770
I know, thank you.

37:58.900 --> 38:00.900
Well?

38:24.900 --> 38:26.970
It's empty, isn't it?

38:29.900 --> 38:33.850
Both boxes. There's nothing in them...

38:33.900 --> 38:35.900
just buttons.

38:40.900 --> 38:42.900
Of course.

38:44.900 --> 38:46.850
Do you know how you know that?

38:46.900 --> 38:50.900
Because you've started to think like me.

38:54.900 --> 38:56.850
It's hell, isn't it?

38:56.900 --> 38:59.850
No-one should have to think like that.

38:59.900 --> 39:01.900
And no-one will.

39:04.900 --> 39:06.900
Not on our watch.

39:16.900 --> 39:18.900
Gotcha!

39:22.900 --> 39:24.850
How can you be so sure?

39:24.900 --> 39:27.900
Because you have a disadvantage, Zygella.

39:28.900 --> 39:30.900
I know that face.

39:34.900 --> 39:38.850
This is all very well, but we
know the boxes are empty now.

39:38.900 --> 39:40.850
We can't forget that.

39:40.900 --> 39:44.900
No. Well, um, you've said
that the last 15 times.

40:00.900 --> 40:03.900
You didn't wipe my memory.

40:04.900 --> 40:09.850
No. Just Kate's. Oh, and your
little friend's here, of course.

40:09.900 --> 40:12.850
When they wake up, they won't
remember what you've done.

40:12.900 --> 40:14.850
It'll be our secret.

40:14.900 --> 40:16.850
- You're going to protect me?
- You're one of us now,

40:16.900 --> 40:18.850
whether you like it, or not.

40:18.900 --> 40:22.500
I don't understand how
you could just forgive me.

40:24.900 --> 40:26.850
Because I've been where you have.

40:26.900 --> 40:28.850
There was another box.

40:28.900 --> 40:31.900
I was going to press another button.

40:32.900 --> 40:35.850
I was going to wipe out
all of my own kind --

40:35.900 --> 40:39.900
man, woman and child -- I
was so sure I was right.

40:40.900 --> 40:42.850
What happened?

40:42.900 --> 40:45.900
The same thing that happened to you.

40:46.900 --> 40:49.770
I let Clara Oswald get inside my head.

40:54.900 --> 40:56.370
Trust me.

40:56.900 --> 40:58.900
She doesn't leave.

41:25.900 --> 41:28.850
Zygon High Command, the
ceasefire is back in place.

41:28.900 --> 41:31.900
The rebels are standing
down. You are all...

41:33.900 --> 41:35.900
.. safe.

41:48.900 --> 41:51.850
- The TARDIS.
- The TARDIS.

41:51.900 --> 41:53.850
What does it stand for?

41:53.900 --> 41:55.850
What?

41:55.900 --> 41:57.850
You're kidding me?

41:57.900 --> 41:58.850
Surely you know that?

41:58.900 --> 42:00.850
I've heard a couple of different versions.

42:00.900 --> 42:02.850
I made it up from the initials.

42:02.900 --> 42:05.850
It stands for "Totally And
Radically Driving In Space".

42:05.900 --> 42:07.850
Do you want to come?

42:07.900 --> 42:11.850
All of the future, all of history,

42:11.900 --> 42:14.100
and all of the universe?

42:14.900 --> 42:16.850
More than anything.

42:16.900 --> 42:20.850
But I think I have to stay.

42:20.900 --> 42:23.850
I've got a couple of
boxes to keep an eye on.

42:23.900 --> 42:26.100
And a world to keep safe.

42:26.900 --> 42:28.500
Fair enough.

42:31.900 --> 42:34.350
Clara, would you mind, um...

42:34.400 --> 42:35.870
Mind what?

42:36.900 --> 42:39.440
I'll see you in the TARDIS, OK?

42:40.900 --> 42:42.900
Uh... yeah, sure.

42:44.900 --> 42:46.850
Take care, you!

42:46.900 --> 42:49.850
You take care of him. Don't
let him die, or anything.

42:49.900 --> 42:51.850
What if he's really annoying?

42:51.900 --> 42:53.900
Then, fine. Got ya.

42:58.900 --> 43:02.850
I need to know -- which one are you?

43:02.900 --> 43:04.850
I'm Osgood.

43:04.900 --> 43:06.850
Human or Zygon?

43:06.900 --> 43:08.850
I'll answer that question one day.

43:08.900 --> 43:11.850
Do you know when day that will be?

43:11.900 --> 43:14.900
The day nobody cares about the answer.

43:17.900 --> 43:19.850
Gotcha!

43:19.900 --> 43:21.850
Oh, look at his face.

43:21.900 --> 43:23.970
It's almost not fair.

43:25.850 --> 43:26.850
I don't... I don't... How... how...

43:26.900 --> 43:28.850
Oh, think it through, Doctor.

43:28.900 --> 43:30.850
It wouldn't be right, would it?

43:30.900 --> 43:32.850
To carry on using Clara's face...

43:32.900 --> 43:33.850
When there's a vacancy.

43:33.900 --> 43:36.900
- Zygella?
- Osgood!

43:38.900 --> 43:40.850
But which one of you...

43:40.900 --> 43:41.850
Osgood!

43:41.900 --> 43:43.850
It doesn't matter which of us is which.

43:43.900 --> 43:46.850
All that matters is that Osgood lives.

43:46.900 --> 43:48.850
And nothing's going to stop us!

43:48.900 --> 43:51.850
You're a credit to your
species, Petronella Osgood.

43:51.900 --> 43:54.850
No, Basil.

43:54.900 --> 43:57.440
We're a credit to both of them.

43:58.850 --> 43:59.850
Oh, and you should know...

43:59.900 --> 44:02.900
I'm a very big fan.

44:13.900 --> 44:16.850
- So, you must have thought I
was dead for a while? - Yeah.

44:16.900 --> 44:18.900
How was that?

44:20.850 --> 44:21.850
Longest month of my life.

44:21.900 --> 44:24.900
It could only have been five minutes!

44:26.900 --> 44:29.170
I'll be the judge of time.

44:47.900 --> 44:49.850
Ice creams?

44:49.900 --> 44:50.850
Yes, ice creams.

44:50.900 --> 44:52.850
Then back to work!

44:52.900 --> 44:55.850
- What's today?
- Oh, you know, same old, same old.

44:55.900 --> 44:58.850
Defending the Earth.

45:12.900 --> 45:14.850
You must not watch this.

45:14.900 --> 45:16.850
You can never unsee it.

45:16.900 --> 45:20.850
24 hours ago, this station fell silent.

45:20.900 --> 45:22.850
We've come to find out why.

45:22.900 --> 45:25.850
- What are these?
- Morpheus. - What is Morpheus?

45:25.900 --> 45:29.850
The Morpheus machine concentrates
the whole nocturnal experience.

45:29.900 --> 45:31.850
- Now you can go a whole month
without sleep. - Time is money.

45:31.900 --> 45:35.850
Congratulations, Professor.
You've conquered nature.

45:35.900 --> 45:38.640
You've also created an abomination.

45:38.900 --> 45:40.850
Run! Run! Run!

45:40.900 --> 45:43.900
You can't stop them. None of us can.
