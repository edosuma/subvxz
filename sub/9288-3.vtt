01:19.146 --> 01:19.914
Authorization?

01:20.114 --> 01:22.616
Bauer, 4-3-9-3, CTU.

01:57.982 --> 01:58.950
Okay, we're on it.

01:59.150 --> 02:02.152
Get back to me as soon
as you've got a match.

02:13.113 --> 02:15.080
- Bauer.
- Jack, I talked to her.

02:17.082 --> 02:18.367
What did she say?

02:18.868 --> 02:20.269
She and Janet went to some party.

02:20.469 --> 02:21.871
So, you gonna go pick them up?

02:22.037 --> 02:23.839
I don't know where she is,
she didn't tell me.

02:24.039 --> 02:25.758
- What?
- Well...

02:25.958 --> 02:29.460
I don't know, maybe I'm being paranoid,
but she sounded... different, I dunno...

02:29.961 --> 02:33.464
She told me that she loved me before
she hung up.

02:33.664 --> 02:34.465
That's not Kim.

02:34.966 --> 02:36.259
Well, she's knows she's going
to get grounded.

02:36.359 --> 02:38.052
She's just trying to reduce the sentence.

02:38.252 --> 02:40.771
Yeah, you're probably right.
How are you?

02:40.971 --> 02:42.156
Are you okay?

02:42.356 --> 02:44.325
Yeah, yeah, I'm fine, um...

02:44.525 --> 02:46.527
Listen, is that guy York still with you?

02:47.027 --> 02:48.362
Yeah. He's gonna take me home now.

02:48.562 --> 02:50.497
Don't you think you should
wait by Janet's car?

02:50.697 --> 02:54.317
Who knows what kind of shape the girls
will be in when they get dropped off.

02:54.517 --> 02:57.904
No, Alan doesn't seem to
think that's necessary.

02:58.104 --> 02:59.956
Why don't you put Alan on the phone?

03:01.958 --> 03:03.241
Teri, just put him on the phone.

03:04.159 --> 03:04.826
Okay.

03:06.328 --> 03:09.631
Alan, my husband would like
to speak with you.

03:11.049 --> 03:13.769
- Hi, this is Alan.
- Alan, Jack Bauer.

03:13.969 --> 03:17.638
I can't thank you enough for helping
us out with this.

03:17.838 --> 03:19.640
I'm just glad the girls
are with each other.

03:20.057 --> 03:22.760
Me, too. Look, I'm stuck at work.
I'm in a bit of an emergency.

03:22.960 --> 03:24.729
- Yeah, Teri said...
- I'd appreciate it...

03:24.929 --> 03:28.649
...if you wouldn't mind hanging out at
the store and waiting for them to return.

03:28.849 --> 03:32.569
The thing is, I don't think they're going
to be back for at least a couple of hours.

03:32.769 --> 03:34.371
The thing is, Alan,
it's a pretty rough neighborhood.

03:34.571 --> 03:37.574
And I would hate for there to be a
problem when they return.

03:37.774 --> 03:39.075
Sure, we'll stay.

03:39.275 --> 03:40.576
Thank you.

03:41.076 --> 03:42.961
Thank you.

03:43.161 --> 03:45.948
You've got to be kidding me.
We had a deal, Mandy.

03:46.148 --> 03:51.253
You promised to deliver Belkin's ID for
$1 million, now she wants to double it?

03:51.453 --> 03:53.554
I apologize. She doesn't know
how this works.

03:53.754 --> 03:57.091
This is your fault! You involved
an amateur in our business.

03:57.291 --> 03:59.394
If I'm such an amateur, how...

03:59.594 --> 04:02.129
I'm just trying to get us more money.

04:02.329 --> 04:04.130
There is no money.

04:04.631 --> 04:05.932
Not anymore.

04:06.132 --> 04:08.935
Ira, don't turn this into something
else. I will fix it.

04:14.107 --> 04:15.108
What?

04:17.108 --> 04:18.978
No, we don't have it yet.

04:19.445 --> 04:20.245
Yes.

04:20.446 --> 04:22.665
No, of course.

04:22.865 --> 04:26.368
I will get back to you as
soon as we're ready.

04:33.875 --> 04:37.345
Talk to her. Explain what I do.

04:37.545 --> 04:40.081
- I will, but our deal stands.
- Take care of it!

04:52.925 --> 04:55.761
I need to get out of here, my friend.

04:55.961 --> 04:58.264
It'll just be a little longer.

05:10.442 --> 05:14.412
We've been getting death threats since
my husband announced his candidacy.

05:14.913 --> 05:16.631
What is different about this one?

05:16.831 --> 05:20.634
Well, I'm not privy to that
kind of information.

05:20.834 --> 05:24.121
All I can tell you is that my
unit is only called in...

05:24.321 --> 05:26.056
...when the threat becomes more serious.

05:26.256 --> 05:29.259
Then why did you let him
walk out on his own?

05:29.459 --> 05:31.260
We will find him, Mrs. Palmer.

05:34.764 --> 05:36.065
I know. I'm sorry.

05:36.265 --> 05:39.068
We're grateful to have you here.

05:39.268 --> 05:41.403
He's not down in the lobby.
I looked everywhere.

05:41.603 --> 05:44.990
Keith, you shouldn't be leaving the suites.
Let these men do their job.

05:45.190 --> 05:47.474
Look, there's an all-night coffee
shop a couple of blocks down.

05:47.674 --> 05:49.626
I bet he just wanted to be by himself.
I'm going to go get him.

05:49.711 --> 05:52.447
No. Keith, Keith.
You're not going anywhere.

05:52.647 --> 05:55.199
Secret Service knows this city
a lot better than we do.

05:55.399 --> 05:56.501
- Mom, I'll be right back.
- No.

05:56.701 --> 05:59.370
I'm sorry, son. We need you to stay here.

06:00.371 --> 06:01.672
Why?

06:01.872 --> 06:05.209
We treat a threat on a candidate's life
as a threat to the entire family.

06:05.409 --> 06:07.577
We need to protect you as well.

06:07.777 --> 06:08.578
Keith.

06:09.996 --> 06:12.382
Your father's going to be fine.

06:41.659 --> 06:42.659
Yeah?

06:43.160 --> 06:44.711
I need an update on the Bauer girl.

06:44.911 --> 06:47.414
Everything's copa.
We're just waiting for you.

06:47.948 --> 06:49.599
I'm running a little late.

06:49.799 --> 06:51.451
We're not going anywhere.

06:51.952 --> 06:53.453
That's right, you're not.

06:54.920 --> 06:57.614
She's in a lot of pain, man,
I think you broke her arm.

06:57.814 --> 07:00.509
You think so? Should we take
her to the hospital...

07:01.010 --> 07:02.795
...to get some X-rays?

07:04.263 --> 07:07.515
Gaines is running late. Gonna smoke
another "J." You want one?

07:07.715 --> 07:08.933
Sure.

07:15.774 --> 07:16.575
My arm!

07:16.775 --> 07:18.143
Try not to move.

07:20.527 --> 07:23.480
Dan, please. She needs to see a doctor.

07:29.236 --> 07:31.137
At least give her something, man.

07:31.337 --> 07:33.239
I'm not wasting my stash on her.

07:36.876 --> 07:40.329
So, what, is Dan the boss and you
have to do everything he says?

07:55.477 --> 07:57.478
I thought I told you!

08:01.599 --> 08:02.933
Don't press me, man.

08:08.905 --> 08:11.107
I should've never used you.

08:26.755 --> 08:28.891
You're going to give her that?

08:29.091 --> 08:32.010
Want me to take away the pain, or not?

10:03.060 --> 10:04.862
Hey.

10:05.062 --> 10:07.731
Hey, this is a private lot, homie.

10:07.931 --> 10:09.733
You got to pay to park here.

10:09.933 --> 10:10.533
I see.

10:10.733 --> 10:12.736
And you're the attendant?

10:12.936 --> 10:14.938
That's right. It's going to cost you.

10:15.138 --> 10:17.273
$100. So give it up.

10:28.166 --> 10:30.919
You're that dude! Palmer!

10:31.119 --> 10:34.389
- No, that's not me.
- Yeah, it's you! Damn!

10:34.589 --> 10:38.759
Dude, this guy's running for president.
I seen him on TV.

10:38.959 --> 10:39.760
Yeah?

10:40.678 --> 10:43.481
Yeah? Yeah, yeah... yeah!

10:43.681 --> 10:47.050
What you going to do for
me, Mr. President?

10:47.250 --> 10:48.768
See, that's your problem.

10:49.102 --> 10:51.221
You want everyone else to do the work.

10:51.721 --> 10:54.408
What are you going to do for yourselves?

10:54.608 --> 10:57.777
See, man, all y'all,
you all got the same rap.

10:59.278 --> 11:01.280
Keep going like this...

11:01.780 --> 11:04.233
...and you'll be dead in five years.

11:04.433 --> 11:05.985
Man, like you know my life.

11:06.485 --> 11:07.987
More than you think.

11:28.672 --> 11:30.173
Yeah, yeah!

12:03.704 --> 12:05.005
CTU. Myers.

12:05.205 --> 12:07.207
- Hey, it's me.
- Jack, where are you?

12:07.708 --> 12:09.009
I'm about a block away.

12:09.209 --> 12:12.712
I need you to print up a hard copy of Tony's
passenger breakdown. Put it on my desk.

12:12.912 --> 12:13.713
Okay.

12:14.213 --> 12:16.215
Wait there. I wanna talk to you alone.

12:16.415 --> 12:17.016
Sure.

12:17.216 --> 12:19.218
Great, I'll be there in a minute.

12:19.418 --> 12:20.219
Okay. Bye.

12:49.329 --> 12:51.131
Keep working.

12:51.331 --> 12:53.333
Has Division responded
to the two dead agents?

12:53.833 --> 12:55.335
Yeah. They're picking them up now.

12:55.535 --> 12:56.419
Good.

12:56.920 --> 12:59.639
- Anyone we know?
- Someone we know.

12:59.839 --> 13:02.141
I'm afraid it was Richard Walsh.

13:03.642 --> 13:06.645
I'm sorry, Jamey,
I know what he meant to you.

13:09.064 --> 13:11.867
What is going on? Does this have
anything to do with Palmer?

13:12.067 --> 13:13.675
That's what we got to find out.

13:13.775 --> 13:16.571
Look, I don't have time to
go into all the details...

13:16.771 --> 13:19.073
...but I've got to put you
in a very difficult position.

13:19.574 --> 13:21.576
You're the only person I can trust.

13:21.776 --> 13:23.378
What do you mean?

13:23.578 --> 13:28.532
Walsh said that we've got a problem on the
inside. He told me to talk only to you

13:32.536 --> 13:34.838
This is the keycard I sent you.

13:35.038 --> 13:37.341
On it is pertinent information
to the hit on Palmer.

13:37.541 --> 13:41.152
How long is it going to take to
pull all the data off of it?

13:41.352 --> 13:44.964
Depending on the kind of encryption,
it could take hours.

13:45.164 --> 13:46.766
Palmer's day starts at 6:00.

13:51.136 --> 13:52.637
I need it before then.

13:57.275 --> 13:59.077
One more thing.

13:59.277 --> 14:02.946
I need to be absolutely certain that it
was Nina's computer that burned that card.

14:03.146 --> 14:03.947
Why?

14:05.449 --> 14:07.618
Because if it was, she's dirty.

14:09.620 --> 14:12.156
I'll need a few minutes alone
at her workstation.

14:12.356 --> 14:13.740
Fine, you got it.

14:15.458 --> 14:17.210
Did you cut yourself?

14:19.128 --> 14:21.047
Yeah. What are you working on?

14:21.247 --> 14:25.418
I gave Nina the passenger list, I was just
cross-checking everything else we got.

14:25.618 --> 14:27.636
Good. I'll be down in a sec.

14:38.563 --> 14:40.564
Will you tell me why
you were at Dunlop Plaza?

14:40.764 --> 14:41.866
I had a meeting with Walsh.

14:42.066 --> 14:44.568
- Is that the passenger list?
- Yes.

14:45.069 --> 14:47.121
Anything unusual?

14:47.321 --> 14:49.624
There's one red flag. A man in first class.

14:49.824 --> 14:53.409
His information is inconsistent. I'm
trying to piece it together now.

14:53.609 --> 14:54.410
Good.

14:58.414 --> 15:00.717
I don't want to tell you
how to do your job...

15:00.917 --> 15:04.419
...you leave without letting me know where
you are, you hold back information.

15:04.920 --> 15:07.756
How can I help you without you letting me?

15:13.712 --> 15:16.514
Do you think that it's possible...

15:16.714 --> 15:20.718
...that someone from within the
agency is behind the hit on Palmer?

15:22.220 --> 15:24.055
Anything is possible.

15:24.555 --> 15:25.940
Do you have a lead?

15:29.226 --> 15:31.144
No, not really.

15:33.196 --> 15:34.498
No.

15:34.698 --> 15:38.401
Why do I feel like you're
not telling me the truth?

15:41.537 --> 15:45.324
Jack, if you've got something, share
it with me, I'll work it up with you.

15:45.524 --> 15:46.825
No, I'm...

15:48.327 --> 15:50.496
I'm just thinking out loud.

15:50.696 --> 15:52.580
Okay, fine.

15:55.800 --> 15:57.585
Anything else?

15:58.553 --> 15:59.254
No.

16:01.890 --> 16:03.591
Actually, there is.

16:07.427 --> 16:09.012
Are you seeing Tony?

16:13.016 --> 16:14.017
Why?

16:18.487 --> 16:20.289
Is it serious?

16:20.489 --> 16:22.542
What is this, Jack?

16:22.742 --> 16:27.079
What do you want to know, am I over you?
Why are we talking about this now?

16:27.279 --> 16:30.081
I'm trying to understand why he's
been giving me a hard time.

16:30.582 --> 16:32.417
I can't answer that for you.

16:39.758 --> 16:40.958
Hold on.

16:44.595 --> 16:45.963
Yeah?

16:46.463 --> 16:50.384
I confirmed that the file on the keycard
definitely came from Nina's computer.

16:55.888 --> 16:57.390
Okay, thank you.

17:02.528 --> 17:04.280
It's Division.

17:04.480 --> 17:07.898
They want the passenger breakdown.
Please send it to them.

17:08.098 --> 17:09.367
Sure.

17:13.989 --> 17:16.241
By the way, your wife called.

17:35.842 --> 17:37.344
- Bauer.
- This is Data Services.

17:37.844 --> 17:40.347
You called in a thumbprint for an ID match?

17:40.547 --> 17:41.198
Yeah.

17:41.398 --> 17:43.199
We checked every database we have.

17:43.399 --> 17:47.353
Nothing. Either this guy doesn't exist, or
his identity has been wiped off the record.

17:47.853 --> 17:48.854
Thank you.

18:03.201 --> 18:04.869
It'll be better for both of us..

18:04.877 --> 18:07.372
Better than what, Bridget.? Where is the ID?

18:08.372 --> 18:10.874
Look, This is not some secret
I'm keeping from you.

18:11.074 --> 18:13.343
This is for both of us.

18:13.543 --> 18:15.487
Do you want to get both of us killed?

18:15.687 --> 18:17.431
They hired you to blow up a plane.

18:17.631 --> 18:20.633
Another $1 million doesn't
mean anything to these people.

18:20.833 --> 18:24.970
You're wrong. Money is the only
thing that these people care about.

18:32.010 --> 18:34.012
You know he can't hurt us.

18:37.015 --> 18:38.016
Baby.

18:40.518 --> 18:43.187
Nobody can hurt us.

18:46.190 --> 18:48.025
$1 million for you...

18:48.992 --> 18:50.994
...$1 million for me.

18:52.830 --> 18:55.164
Don't you like the way that sounds?

19:09.511 --> 19:11.012
Okay.

19:14.933 --> 19:16.435
We are going to do this your way.

19:16.685 --> 19:18.270
Great.

19:18.470 --> 19:20.771
- Okay, let's tell him.
- No.

19:21.272 --> 19:23.607
It'll be better if I do it myself.

19:26.894 --> 19:29.063
You're always looking out for me.

19:34.984 --> 19:36.786
I know you're just helping.

19:39.656 --> 19:41.207
What happened?

19:41.407 --> 19:43.409
Do you remember anything?

19:43.609 --> 19:45.544
Yeah.

19:45.744 --> 19:50.249
We were at the furniture
store, dancing. Where's Dan?

19:53.051 --> 19:55.053
Dan broke your arm.

19:57.588 --> 19:59.924
- Dan likes me.
- Yeah? Look at it.

20:05.897 --> 20:07.098
Come on.

20:09.983 --> 20:13.403
Listen to me. This is serious.
We're being kidnapped.

20:13.603 --> 20:16.323
We need to escape. Can you walk?

20:18.325 --> 20:19.126
I guess.

20:19.326 --> 20:21.744
Okay. Come on.

20:27.166 --> 20:30.202
Get ready. When I say go, we go.

20:30.703 --> 20:32.338
Go where?

20:32.538 --> 20:34.806
Just stay with me, okay?

20:35.006 --> 20:37.258
You've got to understand this, okay?

20:37.458 --> 20:41.179
We could die if we don't get
out of here. Hold my hand.

20:43.014 --> 20:43.848
Ready.

20:44.965 --> 20:45.966
Go!

20:51.388 --> 20:52.472
Hey!

20:53.473 --> 20:55.642
No! Get back here!

20:57.977 --> 21:00.112
We've got to get them!

21:04.700 --> 21:06.485
- Go get them!
- I am!

21:06.986 --> 21:09.871
This is your fault! This is what
I was talking about!

21:10.071 --> 21:10.872
Shut up!

21:13.375 --> 21:14.676
Get back here!

21:14.876 --> 21:17.629
We've got to get them. They cannot get away.

21:17.829 --> 21:20.582
This is good work.
Keep me informed. Thank you.

21:24.251 --> 21:25.636
Shut the door.

21:29.139 --> 21:30.641
Are we saying Nina's a traitor?

21:31.058 --> 21:33.144
We're not saying anything.
We need to know more.

21:33.344 --> 21:36.446
Until we find out, should I shut
down her confidential access?

21:36.646 --> 21:40.600
No, that'll slow everything down. There's
got to be an explanation for this.

21:40.800 --> 21:43.903
Right now, what I really need
is the data off of that card.

21:44.103 --> 21:48.690
Aren't we obligated to seal off her
channels with this much evidence?

21:48.890 --> 21:51.577
Look, you were seeing her, weren't you?

21:52.578 --> 21:54.813
That is none of your business.

21:55.013 --> 21:57.249
I think in this case it is.

22:00.751 --> 22:04.672
Yes. Yes, when my wife and I were
separated, I was seeing Nina.

22:04.872 --> 22:07.875
- Did you tell her anything you shouldn't have?
- No!

22:11.628 --> 22:13.430
I don't think so.

22:13.630 --> 22:18.134
I trusted her with everything that
was coming through here, but...

22:21.888 --> 22:23.397
Fine, shut down her access.

22:23.597 --> 22:25.144
Okay, what's she working on?

22:25.344 --> 22:26.892
747 passenger breakdown list.

22:27.192 --> 22:29.695
Good, it's not a secure socket.
She won't know.

22:29.895 --> 22:30.696
Good.

22:34.199 --> 22:36.451
Jamey?

22:36.651 --> 22:38.820
Don't worry. I won't say anything.

22:39.320 --> 22:40.288
Thank you.

22:56.303 --> 22:57.804
We gotta get them!

23:05.728 --> 23:07.013
Hey, get out of here.

23:07.513 --> 23:09.515
Where'd they go?

23:15.937 --> 23:19.858
Forget it. Come on, man. Don't...

23:20.058 --> 23:21.526
Hey, come back.

23:22.944 --> 23:26.163
You just cost me $50.
You're going to pay for this!

23:29.083 --> 23:30.084
What up?

23:30.284 --> 23:32.286
See two girls run past here?

23:34.204 --> 23:36.956
- Yeah, I seen 'em.
- Which way'd they go?

23:38.624 --> 23:41.594
- Who are they?
- Did you see them or not?

23:47.183 --> 23:48.717
They went down Central.

23:50.719 --> 23:51.653
Check it out.

23:51.853 --> 23:53.655
I'll look around here.

23:53.855 --> 23:56.358
- Yeah?
- It's Gaines. How's it going?

23:56.558 --> 23:57.809
Everything's fine.

23:58.310 --> 24:00.728
Change of plans. We're going
to meet at a new location.

24:00.928 --> 24:02.730
Just let me know. I'll meet you there.

24:04.732 --> 24:08.486
- We need to get to a phone.
- No, you need to pay up!

24:28.804 --> 24:30.089
Is this real?

24:31.557 --> 24:33.559
Thank you very much.

25:27.691 --> 25:29.193
What couldn't wait until morning?

25:29.693 --> 25:31.195
Kingsley? She called me about an hour ago.

25:31.395 --> 25:33.998
Said she had some new information.

25:34.198 --> 25:37.401
David, you got me out of bed at
2:00 a. m. What did she say?

25:37.601 --> 25:40.903
She said the Gibson boy,
the one who raped Nicole...

25:41.103 --> 25:42.705
...didn't commit suicide.

25:42.905 --> 25:45.208
That he was... thrown out of a window.

25:47.210 --> 25:49.996
So, he was thrown out of a window.
Who cares?

25:50.196 --> 25:51.880
She said it was Keith!

25:55.383 --> 25:58.386
She's going to publicly accuse
my son of murder.

26:02.140 --> 26:03.641
Ok. There's a couple of ways to handle this.

26:03.841 --> 26:05.693
It's a lie, Carl!

26:05.893 --> 26:09.864
It's dirty politics,
and I won't stand for it.

26:10.064 --> 26:12.489
My family had to live through
that nightmare years ago.

26:12.589 --> 26:14.351
I won't put Nicole through it again.

26:14.551 --> 26:16.152
And Keith couldn't...

26:16.352 --> 26:20.273
This bastard Hodges waits 'til the primary
so you don't have time to respond.

26:20.773 --> 26:22.575
I don't care what day it is. It's a lie...

26:22.775 --> 26:25.578
I know, but we can't pretend that
day isn't important.

26:25.778 --> 26:29.114
I'll put a lid on Kingsley, at
least until the polls close.

26:29.314 --> 26:31.166
We win the primary, then take it from there.

26:31.366 --> 26:34.620
No. We've got to find out who's sourcing
this and get them to recant.

26:34.820 --> 26:38.123
I'll figure out where this is
coming from and I'll cut it off.

26:38.624 --> 26:40.124
But, David...

26:41.125 --> 26:42.477
We go back a few years.

26:42.677 --> 26:45.579
You have your principles,
you don't compromise. Blah, blah, blah.

26:45.679 --> 26:48.683
That's why I love you, but you knew
the gloves were going to come off.

26:48.883 --> 26:49.734
They are off.

26:49.934 --> 26:52.319
That's why you have me.

26:52.519 --> 26:54.521
Go back and forget about this.

26:55.522 --> 26:56.606
I'm on it.

26:59.609 --> 27:02.612
I can't let them throw my son to the wolves.

27:02.812 --> 27:05.030
David. I'll take care of it.

27:07.566 --> 27:10.786
- Is that you?
- Yeah. You better get lost.

27:11.287 --> 27:13.122
I'll call you in an hour.

27:18.409 --> 27:19.744
It's okay, fellas.

27:21.663 --> 27:22.881
I'm fine.

27:43.232 --> 27:44.233
Damn it.

27:49.238 --> 27:52.190
Let's go back to the front
and wait for them to leave.

27:52.390 --> 27:53.191
Okay.

27:55.610 --> 27:57.412
They're not on Central.

27:57.612 --> 27:59.247
Just keep looking! We gotta find them.

27:59.447 --> 28:02.334
I'll take the side streets. They're
around here somewhere.

28:04.785 --> 28:06.287
- We've gotta find them!
- Okay.

28:13.093 --> 28:15.036
You're in my space.

28:15.236 --> 28:17.180
I'm sorry, we'll leave.

28:21.935 --> 28:23.937
Is there a phone around here?

28:24.137 --> 28:24.804
No.

28:25.271 --> 28:26.773
What are you looking for?

28:27.273 --> 28:28.358
Wanna score some dope?

28:28.558 --> 28:32.611
We need to get rid of those guys.
Can you help us get to a phone?

28:32.811 --> 28:34.613
You want me to help you?

28:37.232 --> 28:40.953
What are your little designer jeans worth?
$500?

28:42.320 --> 28:44.905
And those kicks, another $125?

28:50.795 --> 28:53.880
You want to trade places
with me for a while?

28:54.080 --> 28:58.051
Want to turn tricks while I snuggle with
your daddy in the Hollywood foothills?

29:05.225 --> 29:06.725
Go away.

29:20.021 --> 29:21.939
We've been kidnapped.

29:22.940 --> 29:26.160
I don't know... Her arm is broken.

29:26.744 --> 29:29.247
Those guys are still out there.

29:36.670 --> 29:39.006
Welcome to the neighborhood.

29:42.009 --> 29:45.261
Is there any other way out
besides the front door?

29:47.797 --> 29:50.683
- But if we could just...
- But nothing. Get out!

29:51.017 --> 29:52.018
Go!

30:22.211 --> 30:25.081
How long have you been playing me?

30:25.581 --> 30:26.982
Playing you?

30:27.182 --> 30:28.384
Playing me!

30:28.584 --> 30:30.386
What are you doing?

30:31.303 --> 30:32.971
Why don't you tell me about this?

30:33.171 --> 30:34.222
Tell you what, Jack?

30:34.723 --> 30:36.725
Skip the "I don't know what
you're talking about" phase.

30:36.925 --> 30:38.226
You loaded this card with intel.

30:38.727 --> 30:41.980
I wanna know who you're working for
and who you smuggled this card to.

30:42.180 --> 30:43.731
You're delirious!

30:43.931 --> 30:46.567
- Who are you working for?
- I work for you.

30:47.068 --> 30:49.070
Who are you working for?

30:49.570 --> 30:52.206
- Who are you working for?
- I work for you!

30:52.406 --> 30:55.408
Whoever programmed this card is
involved with the hit on Palmer.

30:55.909 --> 30:58.361
This came from your computer.

30:59.362 --> 31:02.365
I don't care where it came from.
I didn't do it.

31:07.003 --> 31:09.505
And I can't believe that you think I did.

31:20.631 --> 31:24.769
There it is. $1 million in your account
in addition to what we already agreed on.

31:24.969 --> 31:26.804
Now, where's the ID?

31:27.805 --> 31:29.607
Let's get it.

31:29.807 --> 31:31.542
No, just the three of us.

31:31.742 --> 31:33.477
And why do I trust you?

31:34.478 --> 31:36.313
Because you want the ID.

31:49.158 --> 31:51.160
I'm going to miss you, Mandy.

32:05.223 --> 32:07.842
- How's your arm?
- It's okay if I don't move it.

32:08.042 --> 32:09.726
Then don't move it.

32:44.876 --> 32:47.878
I know you're in here.
I can smell your perfume.

32:50.881 --> 32:52.383
Where are you?

32:53.384 --> 32:55.886
This is starting to piss me off!

33:16.288 --> 33:18.540
He's going to be ready.

33:19.791 --> 33:21.293
I'm telling you.

33:21.543 --> 33:24.912
No, I saw him work out
yesterday. He looked good.

33:25.112 --> 33:26.914
He's going to be ready.

33:27.415 --> 33:28.716
Excuse me.

33:28.916 --> 33:29.917
I'll call you back.

33:31.419 --> 33:33.438
You looking for something?

33:33.638 --> 33:35.422
Can you help us? These guys are after us.

33:35.922 --> 33:36.807
What guys?

33:37.007 --> 33:40.260
I'll pay you whatever you want.
Just get us out of here!

33:40.927 --> 33:42.429
Let's see the money.

33:42.929 --> 33:46.016
I don't have it on me. When you get
us home, my parents will pay you.

33:46.315 --> 33:47.616
Whatever you want.

33:47.816 --> 33:50.936
Sorry, I run a cash-up-front business.

33:51.136 --> 33:52.438
What's your name, sweetheart?

33:52.938 --> 33:53.439
Janet.

33:57.776 --> 34:01.279
Can't we just use your phone
at least, please?

34:03.781 --> 34:05.083
Come here!

34:06.367 --> 34:09.621
Go! Run! Take the phone and run! Go, go, go!

34:11.538 --> 34:12.755
Go!

34:22.799 --> 34:24.016
Run!

34:25.967 --> 34:27.270
It's cool, man.

34:49.540 --> 34:50.925
Is this right?

34:51.425 --> 34:52.592
What?

34:52.793 --> 34:55.295
They just posted a memorandum.

34:55.496 --> 34:57.097
Richard Walsh is dead.

34:59.099 --> 35:02.101
That can't be. He was just here an hour ago.

35:02.301 --> 35:03.538
That's what it says.

35:13.645 --> 35:15.030
Oh, my God.

35:18.617 --> 35:21.144
Can you find out what happened?

35:21.344 --> 35:23.671
Jack's got me working on something.

35:23.871 --> 35:28.376
All right. Can you open up a socket on
my terminal? I'll check it myself.

35:31.245 --> 35:32.630
Sure.

35:33.130 --> 35:34.131
Thanks.

35:46.059 --> 35:47.060
Farrell.

35:47.560 --> 35:49.061
I need you up here now. Do you have it yet?

35:49.261 --> 35:50.954
Almost. Another couple minutes.

35:51.154 --> 35:52.848
As soon as you're done, come up.

36:41.393 --> 36:42.727
Thank you.

37:06.883 --> 37:08.751
That job this summer. You in?

37:21.513 --> 37:22.647
Yes.

37:24.266 --> 37:26.267
Okay, Jonathan, you're done.

37:41.831 --> 37:43.283
I had no choice.

38:02.217 --> 38:05.353
The keycard was definitely programmed
from Nina's computer.

38:05.553 --> 38:08.406
The log-in time was 10:14 p. m.

38:08.606 --> 38:12.310
Looks like the next 20 minutes were
spent gathering data...

38:12.510 --> 38:14.778
...and another seven to burn
it into the keycard.

38:14.978 --> 38:17.697
Log-out was 10:41, January 14.

38:18.148 --> 38:20.150
It goes on to specify
which files were accessed.

38:20.650 --> 38:22.702
If you want more details,
there's about two screens...

38:22.902 --> 38:23.570
Wait a minute.

38:24.070 --> 38:27.323
- What was the date?
- January 14, a few months ago.

38:27.523 --> 38:29.708
Second weekend in January, Jack.

38:29.908 --> 38:31.710
That's all I got.

38:33.963 --> 38:36.966
Thank you, Jamey.
That's all I need right now.

38:45.223 --> 38:49.060
That was the same weekend that we
were in Santa Barbara together.

38:55.432 --> 38:57.935
Someone from this office
hacked your log-in code.

38:58.435 --> 38:59.937
They're in your system.

39:00.437 --> 39:02.780
You were way off on this one, Jack.

39:02.980 --> 39:05.324
- I'm sorry, Nina..
- How could you?

39:35.803 --> 39:37.104
Division.

39:37.304 --> 39:39.607
This is Tony Almeida at CTU.

39:39.807 --> 39:42.809
Look, you better get down here right away.

39:44.811 --> 39:48.114
Jack Bauer needs to be
relieved of his command.

40:03.245 --> 40:05.746
- Hello?
- Mom, you've got to come get us!

40:05.946 --> 40:07.582
Kim? What's wrong? Still at the party?

40:07.999 --> 40:09.800
There was no party. They made us say that.

40:10.000 --> 40:10.801
Who?

40:11.302 --> 40:14.222
These guys. Listen, we're in
North Hollywood, behind...

40:14.422 --> 40:16.224
Platt's Auto Body! Platt's Auto Body!

40:16.424 --> 40:17.024
Kim, they're coming!

40:17.224 --> 40:18.725
- You got to come now!
- Kim!

40:19.726 --> 40:21.395
What's going on? Teri?

40:21.595 --> 40:24.039
- 911 Emergency.
- Listen, my daughter's in trouble.

40:24.239 --> 40:26.683
She's in North Hollywood,
behind Platt's Auto Body.

40:27.183 --> 40:28.935
It sounded like someone was chasing her!

40:35.107 --> 40:36.609
Come on, Kim!

40:50.421 --> 40:51.422
No!

40:53.924 --> 40:55.926
No, look at me.

41:00.931 --> 41:01.932
No!

41:02.432 --> 41:04.184
I told you to chill.
Why didn't you listen?

41:04.384 --> 41:05.602
Let go of me! No!

41:05.802 --> 41:07.403
Shut up!

41:07.603 --> 41:09.021
- Let go!
- Come on.

41:09.522 --> 41:10.323
What about her?

41:10.523 --> 41:12.525
Forget her, we got what we need.

41:12.725 --> 41:14.277
- Come on!
- No!

41:17.063 --> 41:18.947
Keep moving!

41:23.952 --> 41:25.287
Shut up.
