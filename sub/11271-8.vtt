MANAGER COACH

00:05.599 --> 00:08.433
Cheers? Carla, it's your little girI.

00:09.601 --> 00:11.644
What?

00:12.394 --> 00:15.979
The baby? Well, bring her to the phone.

00:18.064 --> 00:23.108
The baby is crying and they can't
make her stop. I'll try a lullaby.

00:23.275 --> 00:27.028
God couldn't be everywhere.
That's why He created mothers.

00:27.194 --> 00:30.571
- And postaI carriers.
- You got her?

00:30.738 --> 00:32.781
Put her ear to the phone.

00:32.947 --> 00:34.990
Sweetie?

00:37.367 --> 00:39.701
Good girI.

00:39.868 --> 00:43.371
Now listen to Mama.

00:45.000 --> 00:51.074

01:29.313 --> 01:31.356
She's asleep.

01:33.732 --> 01:36.317
Thank you, everybody. Thanks a lot.

02:50.819 --> 02:54.237
Everybody, the drinks are on me.
I got my raise.

02:54.404 --> 02:57.030
Congratulations.

02:57.197 --> 03:00.283
- Thank you.
- Congratulations, Cliff.

03:00.449 --> 03:01.783
Thank you.

03:10.413 --> 03:15.291
I know you're a proud guy, but
you've been out of work a long time.

03:15.457 --> 03:18.126
I've got to try to share my good fortune.

03:18.293 --> 03:21.336
I know what your answer's gonna be
to this.

03:21.503 --> 03:24.754
Would you please allow me
to loan you $500?

03:24.921 --> 03:26.964
Sure.

03:28.716 --> 03:33.468
- I beg your pardon?
- Sure. I'd love it. How soon can I get it?

03:33.635 --> 03:38.679
My greatest fear was that you'd say no
in case it hurt our relationship.

03:38.846 --> 03:41.264
Can I get it in cash?

03:41.431 --> 03:45.642
Sure. I guess our friendship's
pretty solid.

03:45.808 --> 03:50.312
We're the kind of guys who know what
the other's gonna say before he says it.

03:50.477 --> 03:52.646
I was wrong this time.

03:55.188 --> 03:57.399
Hey, Mort.
What are you having?

03:57.565 --> 03:59.608
Let me have a draught.

04:00.191 --> 04:04.777
- You gotta help me. I got big trouble.
- Really? What's the problem?

04:04.944 --> 04:09.822
The coach of my kid's baseball team
quit. I figure you're a naturaI for the job.

04:09.989 --> 04:15.701
I'd love to, but I don't have time. I spend
half my life keeping this bar on its feet

04:15.868 --> 04:19.202
and the other half
trying to keep Diane off hers.

04:20.536 --> 04:23.663
I gotta find somebody.
This is a good team.

04:23.830 --> 04:25.998
We've got a chance
of winning the pennant.

04:26.165 --> 04:29.542
Wait a second. Does anyone
wanna manage the team here?

04:29.709 --> 04:33.627
Wanna hear a crazy idea?
What about me?

04:35.795 --> 04:38.714
That's not crazy. That's a great idea.

04:38.881 --> 04:41.841
I knew it was either one or the other.

04:42.008 --> 04:44.051
Just give me a second.

04:44.217 --> 04:47.343
This is perfect for you.
You got some extra time.

04:47.510 --> 04:51.555
- It would be good for you.
- You know I never managed.

04:51.722 --> 04:54.389
The highest I got was third base coach.

04:54.556 --> 04:57.516
- Yeah.
- Don't worry. You'll be great.

04:57.683 --> 05:00.560
- Can I talk to you about this?
- Not right now.

05:00.727 --> 05:03.687
You think I can handle it?
You're not kidding?

05:03.853 --> 05:05.897
I'm not kidding.

05:06.063 --> 05:09.273
- You got a manager.
- I'll introduce you to the kids.

05:09.440 --> 05:12.692
- They're in the park.
- Things are going so fast.

05:12.859 --> 05:18.070
I'll be back before you know I'm gone.
Probably before I know I'm gone.

05:24.157 --> 05:26.366
I just got a reaI strong feeling.

05:26.533 --> 05:29.868
Watch the bar.

05:30.035 --> 05:35.580
No. I mean about this idea
that Coach will manage the team.

05:35.747 --> 05:37.998
I sense disaster.

05:38.165 --> 05:44.210
Come on. The guy's home life is a can of
spaghettiOs and re-runs of "Baretta".

05:44.376 --> 05:48.338
This will be good for him.
Every guy needs a hobby, right?

05:48.505 --> 05:50.547
I wish I had time for one.

05:52.465 --> 05:55.550
You've got time to make your own coaI.

06:03.012 --> 06:07.765
This is serious. Everyone knows there's
a lot of pressure in children's baseball.

06:07.932 --> 06:11.851
The parents take it very seriously.

06:12.018 --> 06:16.938
I'm afraid they'll take somebody
as gentle as Coach and eat him alive.

06:17.103 --> 06:21.524
You're kidding. He's been in the big
leagues. This is not gonna be pressure.

06:21.689 --> 06:26.235
Wait a minute. He was working for
somebody else. He was never the boss.

06:26.401 --> 06:29.277
I can't help feeling something's wrong.

06:29.444 --> 06:33.239
You can have your feelings,
but this is guy's stuff.

06:33.405 --> 06:37.574
I mean, there's a male bond
that happens between men.

06:37.741 --> 06:40.742
Women don't understand.
Hey, sweetheart.

06:40.909 --> 06:45.787
This is part of me that is private and
you're gonna have to stay away from.

06:45.954 --> 06:49.289
So hands off, no trespassing,
end of discussion.

06:49.456 --> 06:51.499
Really.

06:51.666 --> 06:58.002
Very well. And from now on, there's
a part of me that's hands off to you.

07:02.213 --> 07:06.007
Just my luck.
It'll be one of the parts I care about.

07:10.051 --> 07:12.427
- Can I ask you a question?
- Shoot.

07:12.594 --> 07:14.762
Where do you stand on breast-feeding?

07:14.929 --> 07:17.305
As I recall, I liked it.

07:17.472 --> 07:21.349
No. I mean me with my baby in here.

07:21.516 --> 07:25.559
I guess it's cheaper than a piano player.

07:29.229 --> 07:34.315
I'm tired of having to run home to
feed her all the time during my shift.

07:34.482 --> 07:37.276
I should have done like I did
with my others.

07:37.441 --> 07:42.028
- You didn't breast-feed the other four?
- They went right to raw meat.

07:44.654 --> 07:46.989
- Hey, everybody.
- Hey, Cliff.

07:48.740 --> 07:50.783
Thank you.

07:50.950 --> 07:54.451
Remember that money
you were gonna lend me?

07:54.618 --> 07:58.371
Of course. You're a friend,
you're in need, and I'm here to help you.

07:58.538 --> 08:02.915
I've got your money. Look,
is a handshake good enough for you?

08:03.082 --> 08:05.125
- Sure.
- Not for me.

08:05.291 --> 08:07.334
A loan application?

08:07.501 --> 08:11.294
That's right. It's a loan
we're talking about, not a hand-out.

08:11.461 --> 08:14.505
I don't want this kind of humiliation,
all right?

08:14.672 --> 08:17.132
I wouldn't ask unless I really needed it.

08:17.298 --> 08:21.134
All right. I gotcha.
Just kidding around here.

08:21.300 --> 08:24.511
This is gonna go a long way
to pay a lot of bills.

08:24.677 --> 08:27.595
I should think of something nice
for Vera, too.

08:27.762 --> 08:30.431
How about a candleIit dinner for two?

08:30.597 --> 08:33.975
Great. Come on.
We'll talk about Vera later.

08:39.436 --> 08:42.104
Ladies and gentlemen,
introducing the Titans!

08:43.397 --> 08:45.856
Move it. Let's go.

08:47.816 --> 08:50.443
That's a well-drilled team.

08:50.608 --> 08:53.485
- Thank you.
- Yeah, and look at you.

08:53.652 --> 08:56.738
- Thank you.
- How about doing the honours?

08:56.904 --> 08:59.531
Sure. This is Sam Mayday Malone.

08:59.698 --> 09:03.408
Probably the greatest relief pitcher
baseball ever knew.

09:03.575 --> 09:07.077
Then he hit the bottle
and he was through in less than a year.

09:09.578 --> 09:12.580
This is Diane. She's smart.

09:13.748 --> 09:16.582
Let me introduce my boys to you.

09:16.749 --> 09:21.918
This is Peewee, Moose, Juice, Goose,
The Tank, The Chancellor, The Bull,

09:22.085 --> 09:26.421
The Cannonball Express, Specs,
and Dynamic Duo.

09:26.588 --> 09:29.298
What have you been working on so far?

09:29.465 --> 09:32.049
Nicknames.

09:32.216 --> 09:36.093
But the party's over now
and we start busting some butts.

09:36.260 --> 09:38.636
I'll have them in shape
within the week.

09:38.803 --> 09:42.264
- There you go.
- Isn't that the way with children?

09:42.431 --> 09:45.765
DelightfuI melding
of their innocence and your wisdom.

09:45.932 --> 09:49.477
We teach them,
but they leave their impression on us.

09:55.188 --> 09:56.606
Deviant.

09:56.771 --> 10:01.192
Forget it. I can handle this. I got
a way of communicating with kids.

10:01.358 --> 10:04.943
Everybody file out, except you, Specs.

10:05.110 --> 10:07.361
Let's go. Move it, move it.

10:09.905 --> 10:13.615
Maybe this thing will be
a good experience for him.

10:13.781 --> 10:17.826
He's standing a little taller,
there's a light in his eye.

10:17.993 --> 10:20.077
He's like a whole new person.

10:20.244 --> 10:24.163
You get only one chance
to make a mistake on this team.

10:24.330 --> 10:27.415
Go home and tell your mother
you're a flop.

10:29.458 --> 10:32.500
A whole new person I dislike intensely.

10:32.667 --> 10:36.212
You're gonna kick him off the team
for that one incident?

10:36.378 --> 10:39.546
Not just that.
He's leading the league in errors.

10:39.713 --> 10:43.716
The only thing he's had his hands on
is Diane's keister.

11:13.296 --> 11:16.340
Who the hell are you guys talking to?

11:22.134 --> 11:24.719
We've been talking stupid to a duck.

11:24.886 --> 11:27.638
We kept it quiet.

11:32.057 --> 11:34.099
She's hungry.

11:37.852 --> 11:40.270
Well, here's dinner.

11:42.730 --> 11:45.440
It makes us a little uncomfortable.

11:45.606 --> 11:49.692
- OK, OK. I'll go in Sam's office.
- Thank you.

11:49.859 --> 11:52.693
Whatever happened to modesty?

11:52.860 --> 11:55.695
Who'd wanna look
at something like that?

11:55.862 --> 12:00.031
- You guys seen Miss June?
- What have we got here?

12:03.325 --> 12:06.243
Oh, dear. Norm's in season again.

12:07.243 --> 12:09.286
Coach is a little late this evening.

12:09.453 --> 12:12.872
- They must be into an extra innings.
- How are they doing?

12:13.039 --> 12:15.957
They have not lost
since Coach took over.

12:16.124 --> 12:20.293
Coach has lost his sweet disposition.
He's turned into a tyrant.

12:20.460 --> 12:23.920
But he's winning.
That's the important thing here.

12:24.087 --> 12:27.756
Well, I don't think winning
is the most important thing here.

12:27.923 --> 12:30.715
Then you won't mind
losing this argument.

12:30.882 --> 12:35.510
- Over my dead body.
- Don't bring last night into this.

12:37.053 --> 12:41.681
That's exactly what it was.
Your last night.

12:41.847 --> 12:43.890
Come on.

12:44.057 --> 12:47.684
Come on. I was just kidding.
Don't be mad.

12:47.850 --> 12:53.813
What were we arguing about? Coach
is just being dedicated, that's all.

12:53.979 --> 12:56.814
I never thought I'd say this
about another man,

12:56.980 --> 13:00.858
but Coach may have the attributes
to be a good postaI carrier.

13:01.025 --> 13:03.318
Dedication, intensity
single-mindedness.

13:03.484 --> 13:06.986
The inability
to recognise the word "fragile".

13:08.737 --> 13:12.824
I still say this was a mistake for Coach.
Don't touch me.

13:12.989 --> 13:18.243
It's not a mistake. He's got a hobby,
that's all. He's having fun.

13:18.410 --> 13:22.037
I can stand physicaI errors
but not mentaI errors.

13:22.204 --> 13:25.664
- After this, somebody has to go.
- What happened? You lost?

13:25.831 --> 13:27.873
We won, but by only one run.

13:28.749 --> 13:32.084
What's the point if you can't
humiliate the other team?

13:32.251 --> 13:37.087
You've got to intimidate them.
Crush them. Crush them!

13:40.214 --> 13:42.549
Hey, now, there's a fun guy.

13:44.508 --> 13:47.510
He's not having the fun
you're talking about,

13:47.677 --> 13:51.387
laughing and giggling and
running barefoot through fields.

13:51.554 --> 13:55.722
- That's woman's fun.
- Woman's fun.

13:55.889 --> 13:58.891
Yeah. Coach is having men's fun.

13:59.058 --> 14:03.435
He's active, he's working hard,
he's getting the job done.

14:03.602 --> 14:08.814
- Do you believe anything you're saying?
- No, but Iying's another men fun thing.

14:10.273 --> 14:14.358
- I am going to talk to Coach.
- Come on. Leave him alone.

14:14.525 --> 14:21.071
He's obsessing. I know the signs. I had
a small obsession untiI I got some help.

14:21.238 --> 14:22.697
You did?

14:22.864 --> 14:26.240
I was obsessive compulsive
about neatness.

14:26.407 --> 14:28.950
I demanded everything
be in its proper place.

14:29.117 --> 14:33.995
<i>But now look at the laissez faire
attitude I have about my apron.</i>

14:34.162 --> 14:40.207
In the old days, I would have insisted
that it be penciI, pen, penciI, pen, pad.

14:40.373 --> 14:45.126
Now it doesn't matter
if it's pen, penciI, pen, penciI, pad

14:45.293 --> 14:47.544
or penciI, penciI, pen, pen, pad.

14:47.711 --> 14:50.838
Or even penciI, pen, pad, penciI, pen.

14:52.797 --> 14:57.300
There's one thing I can't have. This.
Pad, pen, pen, penciI, penciI.

14:57.466 --> 14:59.509
That's just irritating.

15:09.015 --> 15:11.391
Have we got any more
antacid tablets?

15:11.558 --> 15:14.476
You've been throwing down
a lot of those.

15:14.643 --> 15:17.395
And a lot of good they've been doing me.

15:21.981 --> 15:25.691
Come on. It's busy out here.
Are you working tonight?

15:25.858 --> 15:28.693
Not a chance.
We play our division rivals tomorrow.

15:28.860 --> 15:34.238
Wait. You've got a job here. If you don't
do your work, I have to replace you.

15:34.405 --> 15:38.157
Do what you want,
but stay out of my office.

15:41.075 --> 15:44.910
- Maybe we both ought to go in.
- Let me do the talking.

15:45.077 --> 15:48.079
- You won't know I'm there.
- Like last night.

15:50.539 --> 15:53.249
No, I'll save my left-hander for Saturday.

15:54.333 --> 15:57.918
What am I thinking about?
I don't have a left-hander.

16:00.503 --> 16:02.880
Those boys are children.

16:03.047 --> 16:08.049
And childhood is supposed to be a time
when you're free to play a game

16:08.215 --> 16:10.634
just for the fun of it, you know?

16:10.800 --> 16:13.594
- Fun.
- That's right.

16:13.761 --> 16:17.763
Fun. That's it exactly. Fun!

16:17.929 --> 16:21.641
That's why they're making mistakes.
They're not having fun.

16:21.807 --> 16:26.060
They're gonna learn how to have fun,
or they don't play in my team!

16:29.686 --> 16:31.729
Sit down, right now.

16:31.896 --> 16:33.938
Take a deep breath here.

16:34.939 --> 16:38.775
Don't you think that you...
Coach, let it out.

16:39.942 --> 16:43.028
Don't you think
you're overdoing this a bit?

16:43.195 --> 16:45.653
You know what it takes
to win ball games.

16:45.820 --> 16:51.282
You're doing this to make up for
not making it in the big leagues.

16:51.449 --> 16:53.492
But you don't have to do that.

16:53.658 --> 16:56.911
- You were a damn good coach.
- I was?

16:57.078 --> 17:00.537
You bet, and it was because you cared.

17:00.704 --> 17:06.540
How many times did you walk me up and
down the locker room before games

17:06.708 --> 17:08.751
pouring coffee down my throat?

17:08.917 --> 17:10.960
No one else would have bothered.

17:11.127 --> 17:14.170
You're right. I was a lovely man.

17:15.963 --> 17:20.382
But it's not enough. I'm a contender
for the championship.

17:20.549 --> 17:24.218
When I go out there,
all those parents cheer for me.

17:24.384 --> 17:27.136
- They cheer me on.
- Really?

17:27.303 --> 17:31.764
After all we've been through,
you're asking me to give all that up?

17:31.931 --> 17:35.808
- Well, I...
- Coach, tell us this.

17:35.974 --> 17:39.852
Sure, you walk out there
and you hear the cheers,

17:40.018 --> 17:43.479
but what is it costing you?

17:43.646 --> 17:47.231
Well, let's see. I had to buy a jockstrap.

17:48.482 --> 17:50.608
Hey, how's my baby?

17:50.775 --> 17:53.110
I'm fine, but I'm a little busy.

17:53.276 --> 17:55.653
Come on in.

17:55.820 --> 17:58.238
I'm just gonna check her out.

18:03.824 --> 18:07.118
- You do what you want with your team.
- Thank you.

18:07.284 --> 18:10.786
- Where are you going?
- Please leave me alone.

18:13.496 --> 18:15.622
There, there, Lucia.

18:16.957 --> 18:18.999
Now doesn't that feeI better?

18:19.166 --> 18:21.209
I wish I could do that.

18:27.504 --> 18:29.548
There, there.

18:30.756 --> 18:33.299
- Thanks.
- My pleasure.

18:39.011 --> 18:41.096
You're not going to accept that.

18:41.263 --> 18:45.306
What is the problem
you're trying to solve here?

18:45.473 --> 18:50.226
I mean, the Coach is happy, the families
are happy, the kids are happy.

18:50.393 --> 18:53.602
Here are Coach's
happy little players now.

18:53.769 --> 18:56.521
Are you on the sauce again?

18:56.688 --> 19:00.232
- We're miserable.
- We came to quit.

19:00.398 --> 19:04.651
- We can't stand it any more.
- The pressure's getting to us.

19:05.734 --> 19:10.946
All right. Maybe you guys
ought to tell the Coach to his face.

19:11.113 --> 19:13.906
We'd like to do something else
to his face.

19:14.073 --> 19:18.409
- What are you guys doing here?
- They came by to quit.

19:18.576 --> 19:20.952
Forget it. Nobody's quitting.

19:21.119 --> 19:25.413
Well, I am. I can't take it any more.
You're too hard on me.

19:25.580 --> 19:28.415
I can't sleep. My pets hate me.

19:28.582 --> 19:31.457
I'm starting to smoke again.

19:34.626 --> 19:37.336
I've had enough and I'm through.

19:37.503 --> 19:39.879
Me too!

19:40.046 --> 19:44.382
You're gonna quit. That's what I've got
on my hands, a bunch of quitters?

19:44.549 --> 19:49.593
Go ahead and quit. I can go it alone.
Who needs you? Get outta here! Quit!

19:49.760 --> 19:51.219
Thank you.

19:51.386 --> 19:55.263
Get back here!
Line up against that bar, all of you.

19:59.932 --> 20:01.975
I got a little story for you

20:02.142 --> 20:06.103
and I hope it sticks with you
for the rest of your life.

20:07.270 --> 20:09.604
Sam, what's a good story?

20:10.981 --> 20:14.149
I don't know. What's a good story?

20:15.775 --> 20:18.901
Why don't you tell a story
about a reaI mean guy?

20:19.068 --> 20:21.111
Mean guy?

20:21.278 --> 20:23.863
The one you told me.
The Pledge of Allegiance.

20:24.030 --> 20:26.072
Him!

20:30.450 --> 20:33.577
Listen. When I was a kid in schooI
just about your age,

20:33.744 --> 20:38.246
I had this teacher, a reaI mean guy,
guy named Mr Spires.

20:38.413 --> 20:41.331
He wanted me
to learn the Pledge of Allegiance.

20:41.498 --> 20:45.834
One day in assembly, he had me say it
in front of the whole schooI.

20:46.001 --> 20:49.210
I'd stayed up the whole night before
trying to learn it.

20:49.377 --> 20:54.172
But when I got up on that stage,
I drew a complete blank. I was lost.

20:54.338 --> 21:01.217
And Mr Spires says, "Nobody is going to
leave untiI Pantusso remembers. "

21:01.384 --> 21:07.180
I stood there. It seemed like forever,
with everybody laughing at me.

21:08.555 --> 21:11.807
It was probably the worst day of my life.

21:21.480 --> 21:26.524
And the point is that you finally did learn
the Pledge of Allegiance.

21:26.691 --> 21:28.734
No, I never learned it.

21:30.068 --> 21:33.737
But you respected Mr Spires
for trying to help you.

21:33.904 --> 21:36.197
No, I hated his guts.

21:36.362 --> 21:38.406
But now you respect him for it.

21:38.573 --> 21:41.741
No. He died. I was glad he died.

21:43.909 --> 21:48.578
Thank you. I'm sure the guys
enjoyed that inspiring story.

21:48.745 --> 21:52.164
I guess
I must have said the wrong story.

21:52.331 --> 21:54.832
- I don't know.
- You told the right story.

21:54.999 --> 21:57.292
Why did I say it?

21:57.459 --> 22:02.294
You don't want these guys to leave
hating you like you hated Mr Spires.

22:04.046 --> 22:06.088
Holy mackereI.

22:09.965 --> 22:13.259
So that's what you had on your minds!

22:13.426 --> 22:19.846
Listen. Nobody but nobody's gonna turn
me into a Mr Spires. Understand?

22:20.013 --> 22:22.389
There's gonna be some changes here.

22:22.556 --> 22:24.599
You bet your boots there's gonna be.

22:24.766 --> 22:31.019
From now on, no two-a-day practices.
You're lucky if you get two a week.

22:31.186 --> 22:37.065
And any game we play, everybody plays,
even the lousy ones, like you, Peewee.

22:38.440 --> 22:43.985
Got it? And if we win, we win,
and if we lose, well, tough noogies.

22:45.903 --> 22:47.946
Shut up!

22:48.112 --> 22:50.948
Give these guys sodas till they drop.

22:51.114 --> 22:53.157
And I'm buying it.

22:53.824 --> 22:57.368
Shut up! Turn around
and have your sodas.

23:02.079 --> 23:04.121
If we lose tomorrow, it's your butt.

23:06.540 --> 23:10.251
You made me so happy.
We finally got our Coach back.

23:10.417 --> 23:13.919
Things are gonna be better
than they were before.

23:15.003 --> 23:20.131
There's beauty in art, beauty in nature.
I think that applies to human nature, too.

23:20.297 --> 23:24.509
Things are allowed to take their course,
but we have to be tolerant.

23:24.676 --> 23:28.052
- We have to...
- Your pad's upside down.

24:03.489 --> 24:04.490
