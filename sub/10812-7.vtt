AND I GRADUATED FROM

00:03.878 --> 00:04.587
ONE OF CANADA'S
TOP BUSINESS SCHOOLS

00:04.671 --> 00:07.716
WITH REALLY GOOD GRADES.

00:07.799 --> 00:10.719
NOW I'M USING MY KNOWLEDGE
TO HELP STRUGGLING

00:10.802 --> 00:13.847

00:21.896 --> 00:25.942
THIS IS <i> NATHAN FOR YOU.</i>

00:26.025 --> 00:28.653
THERE'S NOTHING PEOPLE LIKE MORE
THAN BEING SCARED.

00:28.737 --> 00:30.363
- WELL, YEAH, I LIKE MY--
- WOAH!

00:30.447 --> 00:31.781
- OH, MY GOD.

00:31.865 --> 00:33.324
- THAT'S WHY,
WHEN OCTOBER SWINGS AROUND,

00:33.408 --> 00:35.618
HAUNTED HOUSES
ARE BIG BUSINESS.

00:35.702 --> 00:38.204
BRUCE STANTON IS THE OWNER
OF REIGN OF TERROR,

00:38.288 --> 00:41.624
AN ANNUAL HAUNTED HOUSE
IN THOUSAND OAKS, CALIFORNIA.

00:41.708 --> 00:44.544
{\an8}- WE HAVE A PERFECT ENVIRONMENT
TO SET YOU UP TO BE SCARED.

00:44.627 --> 00:45.879
- BUT AFTER TAKING
A WALK-THROUGH

00:45.962 --> 00:48.631
OF THE SUPPOSEDLY
SCARY MANSION,

00:48.715 --> 00:50.175
I CAME OUT
LESS THAN IMPRESSED.

00:50.258 --> 00:51.342
HI.

00:51.426 --> 00:52.594
SO I TALKED TO BRUCE
ONE ON ONE ABOUT AN IDEA I HAD

00:52.677 --> 00:54.095
TO HELP HIS BUSINESS.

00:54.179 --> 00:58.308
WHAT IS THE BEST PRESS
A HAUNTED HOUSE CAN GET?

00:58.391 --> 01:01.478
- THAT IT'S SO SCARY,
SOMEONE PEED THEIR PANTS.

01:01.561 --> 01:03.188
- NO.

01:03.271 --> 01:04.147
PEE IS ONE THING.

01:04.230 --> 01:06.149
I WANT YOUR HAUNTED HOUSE
TO BE SO SCARY

01:06.232 --> 01:11.112
THAT SOMEONE SUES YOU
FOR BEING TOO SCARY.

01:11.196 --> 01:13.990
- I DON'T KNOW THAT
WE WANT PEOPLE TO SUE US.

01:14.073 --> 01:16.826
- IF THE REIGN OF TERROR
WAS SUED FOR BEING TOO SCARY,

01:16.910 --> 01:18.620
THAT NEWS WOULD
ATTRACT THRILL-SEEKERS

01:18.703 --> 01:20.288
FROM AROUND THE WORLD.

01:20.371 --> 01:23.458
THE PLAN, GET CUSTOMERS TO SUE
BY MAKING THEM THINK

01:23.541 --> 01:25.585
THAT THEY'RE
REALLY GOING TO DIE.

01:25.668 --> 01:28.838
- NO, BECAUSE I THINK
THAT WILL BE GOING TOO FAR.

01:28.922 --> 01:32.842
- WELL, YOUR CURRENT APPROACH
COULD GET PRESS TOO.

01:32.926 --> 01:34.135
- YES.

01:34.219 --> 01:37.472
- BY BEING THE WORLD'S
LEAST SCARY HAUNTED HOUSE.

01:37.555 --> 01:38.973
- UH, I DON'T THINK THAT'S
THE APPROACH WE WANT, BUT--

01:39.057 --> 01:40.266
- WELL, THAT'S THE APPROACH
IT SEEMS LIKE

01:40.350 --> 01:40.850
YOU'RE CURRENTLY TAKING.

01:40.934 --> 01:42.977
- NO, WE ARE A SCARY--

01:43.061 --> 01:45.522
- "REIGN OF TERROR.
WHERE PUSSIES GO TO RELAX."

01:45.605 --> 01:47.023
- OH, OKAY.

01:47.106 --> 01:49.067
- OR, "REIGN OF TERROR,
YOU'RE PROBABLY GOING TO DIE."

01:49.150 --> 01:52.362
- YOU MEAN IN THE HAUNTED HOUSE,
WE PAINT A PICTURE

01:52.445 --> 01:55.490
THAT THEIR DEATH IS...
IMMINENT.

01:55.573 --> 01:56.783
- YES.
- OKAY.

01:56.866 --> 01:58.952
- TO SCARE PEOPLE ENOUGH
THAT THEY WOULD SUE,

01:59.035 --> 02:01.371
I EXPLAINED TO BRUCE THAT
WE NEEDED TO CONVINCE CUSTOMERS

02:01.454 --> 02:03.873
THEY SOMEHOW CONTRACTED
A DISEASE THEY'RE LIKELY

02:03.957 --> 02:05.041
TO DIE FROM.

02:05.124 --> 02:07.919
BRUCE RELUCTANTLY AGREED
TO LET ME TRY IT OUT FOR A DAY.

02:08.002 --> 02:10.839
AND AFTER A WEEK OF PREPARATION,
MY ACTORS WERE READY.

02:10.922 --> 02:12.507
IT WAS TIME FOR PEOPLE TO ENTER

AND IT'S AN IMMUNITY--
- KLEIN DISEASE?

03:14.819 --> 03:16.070
- KLEIN'S DISEASE.
- SO WHAT'S THE PROBLEM?

03:16.154 --> 03:18.072
- SHE HAS AN AUTO-IMMUNE THING.

03:18.156 --> 03:20.366
SHE WORRIED WHEN
SHE TOUCHED YOU,

03:20.450 --> 03:20.742
SHE TRANSMITTED
SOMETHING TO YOU.

03:20.825 --> 03:22.619
- MM-HM.

03:22.702 --> 03:23.286
- SO DON'T GET FREAKED OUT
OR ANYTHING,

03:23.369 --> 03:24.954
BUT I CALLED AN AMBULANCE.

COMING TO MAKE SURE.

03:26.205 --> 03:28.082
THEY'LL LOOK AT YOU,
IT'S JUST PRECAUTIONARY.

03:28.166 --> 03:29.709
SO JUST HOLD TIGHT.
THANK YOU SO MUCH.

IN THE HAUNTED HOUSE.

GET HER CHECKED OUT, IF THAT'S--

OF OPEN WOUND OR ANYTHING THAT,

UNDER THE LAW,

UM, ACTUALLY I HAVE
TO GO TO THE HOSPITAL.

THERE WAS SOMEBODY
WITH A DISEASE.

06:45.571 --> 06:47.490
- NOW, I'M NOT TRYING
TO CREATE A LAWSUIT HERE,

06:47.573 --> 06:50.701
I JUST--YOU HAVE CERTAIN RIGHTS
UNDER CALIFORNIA LAW.

06:50.785 --> 06:52.787
- I PAID BRUCE A VISIT
TO FOLLOW UP.

06:52.870 --> 06:54.163
WHAT DID YOU THINK?

06:54.247 --> 06:56.040
- WELL, I THINK IT'S COMPLETELY
IMPRACTICAL FOR A HAUNTED HOUSE.

06:56.124 --> 06:58.251
- BUT PEOPLE WERE SCARED.

06:58.334 --> 07:00.253
- YEAH, I DON'T KNOW,
I COULDN'T TELL.

07:00.336 --> 07:01.587
- WE HAD A LAWYER
THERE AT THE EXIT THAT THINKS,

07:01.671 --> 07:04.215
YOU KNOW, SOME PEOPLE
MIGHT HAVE A CASE.

PETER?
DO YOU WANNA COME IN?

- HELLO.
- HI, THIS IS BRUCE.

07:08.052 --> 07:09.846

- HE RUNS THE HAUNTED HOUSE.

07:09.929 --> 07:10.930
- NICE TO MEET YOU.

07:11.013 --> 07:12.014
SO SOME OF THESE PEOPLE
HAVE A CASE, RIGHT?

07:12.098 --> 07:14.183
- WELL, SOME OF THEM
WERE A LITTLE APPREHENSIVE

07:14.267 --> 07:14.934
AND I'M NOT TRYING TO GET YOU
IN A LOT OF TROUBLE--

07:15.017 --> 07:17.186
- BUT YOU WANT TO SUE.

07:17.270 --> 07:19.522
- I WANT TO SUE FOR
LEGITIMATE CLAIMS, ABSOLUTELY.

07:19.605 --> 07:21.023
- AND THIS IS
A LEGITIMATE CLAIM?

07:21.107 --> 07:23.985
- WELL, IT COULD BE.
AND, UH, WE'LL SEE.

07:24.068 --> 07:25.862
- ALL RIGHT.
- ALL RIGHT, THANKS SO MUCH.

07:25.945 --> 07:27.363
- ALL RIGHT.

07:27.446 --> 07:28.990
- WELL, I'M GLAD I--
YOU KNOW, COULD HAVE HELPED

07:29.073 --> 07:31.367
AND DONE THIS FOR YOU.

07:31.450 --> 07:34.704
- TOOK A GOOD
HAUNTED HOUSE AND...

07:34.787 --> 07:36.622
NOT MADE IT ANY BETTER.
OKAY.

07:36.706 --> 07:38.499
- WELL, I'M TRYING
TO GET YOU PRESS.

07:38.583 --> 07:39.709
- OKAY.

07:39.792 --> 07:42.461
- IN THE END, THE SCARIEST THING
ABOUT THE HAUNTED HOUSE

07:42.545 --> 07:44.463
WAS BRUCE'S TERRIBLE MANNERS.

07:44.547 --> 07:47.633
BUT WHEN SOMEONE'S RUDE TO YOU,
YOU CAN'T TAKE IT PERSONALLY.

07:47.717 --> 07:49.635
YOU JUST HAVE
TO KEEP GOING.

07:53.306 --> 07:55.057
- WHEN YOU LOOK AT ME,
YOU PROBABLY SEE A GUY

07:55.141 --> 07:56.767
WHO HAS IT ALL.

07:56.851 --> 07:59.562
BUT REALLY, THERE'S A LARGE
PART OF ME THAT'S IMMATURE

07:59.645 --> 08:00.396
AND UNDER-DEVELOPED.

16:43.836 --> 16:44.628
{\an8}WONDERFUL.

16:44.712 --> 16:49.133
- OH...THANKS, NATE.

16:49.216 --> 16:50.342
[awkward laugh]

16:50.426 --> 16:54.513
- SO TELL ME YOUR
DEEPEST, DARKEST SECRET.

16:54.596 --> 16:58.434
- MY DEEPEST,
DARKEST SECRET IS...

17:10.863 --> 17:13.656
I DON'T LIKE WEARING SOCKS.

17:13.741 --> 17:14.782
- THAT'S GREAT.

17:14.867 --> 17:17.077
BUT AS THE NIGHT PROGRESSED...

17:17.161 --> 17:18.746
- OH, COOL.

17:18.829 --> 17:19.872
- MAGIC.

17:19.954 --> 17:22.458
MY FLIRTING SKILLS
DRASTICALLY IMPROVED.

17:22.540 --> 17:24.292
- DO YOU RIDE MOTORCYCLES?
I MEAN--

17:24.376 --> 17:28.964
- I DON'T RIDE A MOTORCYCLE,
BUT I AM A BIT OF A BAD BOY.

17:29.048 --> 17:31.884
BUT WHAT HAPPENED NEXT
I WOULD HAVE NEVER EXPECTED.

17:35.345 --> 17:39.266
{\an8}- I LIKE MOTORCYCLES, ACTUALLY.
DO YOU RIDE MOTORCYCLES?

17:39.349 --> 17:44.396
- I DON'T RIDE A MOTORCYCLE,
BUT I AM A BIT OF A BAD BOY.

17:45.731 --> 17:47.191
OH, OKAY.

17:47.274 --> 17:50.027
THAT MIGHT BE JUST--
I MEAN, WE'VE ONLY BEEN TALKING

17:50.110 --> 17:51.195
FOR A FEW MINUTES.

17:51.278 --> 17:55.783
WE MIGHT BE MOVING JUST
A LITTLE BIT FAST FOR ME.

17:55.866 --> 17:58.702
I JUST PREFER TO TAKE
THINGS A LITTLE SLOWER.

18:07.920 --> 18:09.379
MM, NO.

18:09.463 --> 18:11.840
IT'S STILL TOO SOON.

18:11.924 --> 18:14.510
WE NEED TO TAKE THINGS SLOW.
WE JUST MET.

18:14.593 --> 18:16.637
- IT'S OKAY.

18:16.720 --> 18:19.014
- IN THAT MOMENT,
EVERYTHING CHANGED.

18:19.097 --> 18:21.183
I WASN'T READY TO MOVE
AS QUICK AS SHE WAS,

18:21.266 --> 18:25.020
{\an1}BUT I FINALLY KNEW WHAT IT WAS
LIKE TO HAVE A WOMAN COME TO ME.

18:25.103 --> 18:27.189
I REALIZED I DIDN'T
HAVE TO DO CRAZY STUNTS

18:27.272 --> 18:31.276
TO GET WOMEN TO LIKE ME,
I JUST HAD TO BE MYSELF...

18:31.360 --> 18:32.778
INSIDE A $5,000-PER-NIGHT
MANSION

18:32.861 --> 18:35.030
WITH A TV CREW FILMING ME.

18:35.114 --> 18:36.907
BUT FOR A GUY LIKE ME,
WHO'S GONE THROUGH

18:36.990 --> 18:39.993
AN ENTIRE LIFETIME
OF REJECTION,

18:40.077 --> 18:42.871
KNOWING THAT I WAS DESIRABLE
WAS ALL I NEEDED TO NO LONGER

18:42.955 --> 18:45.082
BE NERVOUS AROUND WOMEN.

18:45.165 --> 18:46.041
I HAD ACCOMPLISHED MY GOAL.

18:46.125 --> 18:49.378
SO I GATHERED ALL THE WOMEN
TO TELL THEM

18:49.461 --> 18:50.754
THAT THE SHOW WAS OVER.

18:50.838 --> 18:54.299
I HAVE ACCOMPLISHED MY GOAL,
AND THAT MEANS UNFORTUNATELY

18:54.383 --> 18:58.095
THERE'S NO LONGER A REASON
FOR THIS SHOW,<i> THE HUNK,</i>

18:58.178 --> 19:00.722
TO CONTINUE.

19:00.806 --> 19:02.057
- [whispering]
ARE YOU SERIOUS?

19:02.140 --> 19:04.560
- [scoffs]

19:04.643 --> 19:05.310
- QUESTION.

19:05.394 --> 19:09.314
SO YOU REALLY--
YOU REALLY--

19:09.398 --> 19:11.817
UM, DID YOU GET YOUR--

19:11.900 --> 19:12.901
YOU GOT--
YOU GOT WHAT YOU WANTED

19:12.985 --> 19:13.569
FROM DATING ALL THE GIRLS?

19:13.652 --> 19:15.696
YOU GOT YOUR FEAR MET?

19:15.779 --> 19:17.573
- UM, I THINK--

19:17.656 --> 19:19.908
I THINK IT HELPED ME
OVERCOME IT, YES.

19:19.992 --> 19:21.577
WHY?

19:21.660 --> 19:23.203
- I'M JUST WONDERING.

19:23.287 --> 19:24.955
{\an8}- BUT OTHERS
WERE HAPPY FOR ME.

19:26.290 --> 19:27.291
{\an8}THANK YOU.
- YEAH.

19:27.374 --> 19:29.251
- I HAD ACCOMPLISHED
WHAT I SET OUT TO DO,

19:29.334 --> 19:32.045
BUT THERE WAS STILL
ONE THING I HAD TO MAKE RIGHT.

19:32.129 --> 19:34.923
EARLIER, TONY SHARED
A PERSONAL STORY WITH ME.

19:35.007 --> 19:36.425
HAVE YOU EVER HAD A THREESOME?
- I HAVE, YES.

19:36.508 --> 19:39.469
- AND I ACCIDENTALLY
TOLD IT TO SOME OF THE WOMEN.

19:39.553 --> 19:41.889
HE WAS SAYING HE HAD
A THREESOME WITH TWO GUYS.

19:41.972 --> 19:43.515
- WITH TWO GUYS?
- YEAH.

19:43.599 --> 19:46.059
AND NOW I WANTED
TO APOLOGIZE.

19:46.143 --> 19:47.102
I'M REALIZING NOW,
PERHAPS IT WAS WRONG

19:47.185 --> 19:52.816
TO BRING UP TONY'S
PERSONAL EXPERIENCE HE HAD

19:52.900 --> 19:55.277
IN THE COMFORT OF HIS OWN HOME
WITH TWO MEN.

19:55.360 --> 19:56.945
[overlapping chatter]

19:57.029 --> 20:00.407
- I ALREADY HEARD THE STORY.
- YEAH. YEAH, THE THREESOME.

20:00.490 --> 20:02.117
- HIM WITH TWO GUYS?
- YEAH.

20:02.201 --> 20:04.077
- OH, BUT NOT
WITH TWO GUYS.

20:04.161 --> 20:05.621
- WELL, WAS IT
ONE GUY, ONE GIRL?

20:05.704 --> 20:07.289
OR WAS IT TWO GIRLS?
- NAH.

20:07.372 --> 20:10.959
- WHY IS THAT IMPORTANT?
- EXACTLY. THAT'S NOT IMPORTANT.

20:11.043 --> 20:13.170
- AND EVEN IF HE DID,
IT'S HIS OWN BUSINESS.

20:13.253 --> 20:16.548
- YEAH, WE DON'T CARE.
- YEAH, WE DON'T CARE.

20:16.632 --> 20:17.215
- YEAH.
- IT'S ALL GOOD.

20:17.299 --> 20:20.093
- SO I APOLOGIZE FOR THAT,

20:20.177 --> 20:22.262
AND I DON'T WANT TO HAVE
ANY HARD FEELINGS--

20:22.346 --> 20:23.972
- NO HARD FEELINGS.
- BETWEEN US.

20:24.056 --> 20:27.434
- YEAH, ALL RIGHT.
- ALL RIGHT.

20:27.517 --> 20:28.977
- YOUR FEARS ARE ALL GONE?

20:29.061 --> 20:30.938
- HE'S A GREAT GUY.
HE REALLY IS.

20:31.021 --> 20:33.482
- FROM WHAT
YOU KNOW OF.

20:33.565 --> 20:35.317
- OH, YOU'RE NOT?
- NO, I'M A GREAT GUY.

20:35.400 --> 20:36.777
- WHY'D YOU SAY,
"FROM WHAT YOU KNOW OF"?

20:36.860 --> 20:38.070
- WELL, FROM
WHAT YOU KNOW OF ME.

20:38.153 --> 20:39.404
- YEAH, BUT I JUST
CALLED YOU A GREAT GUY.

20:39.488 --> 20:39.988
WHY ARE YOU
ARGUING AGAINST THAT?

20:40.072 --> 20:41.490
- ARE YOU A GOOD GUY?

20:41.573 --> 20:45.160
- AS THE WOMEN WERE LEAVING,
I FELT CONFIDENT IN MYSELF,

20:45.243 --> 20:47.996
KNOWING THAT IF I EVER
WANTED TO FIND LOVE--

20:48.080 --> 20:49.206
THANK YOU.

20:49.289 --> 20:53.085
I COULD JUST CREATE A FAKE
REALITY SHOW ALL OVER AGAIN.

20:57.297 --> 20:57.798
{\an8}- [blows]

20:57.881 --> 20:59.383
{\an8}[airplane buzzing]

21:01.593 --> 21:04.846
{\an8}- AHH!

21:04.930 --> 21:07.182
{\an8}WERE YOU SCARED?

21:07.265 --> 21:08.350
{\an8}- I BUILT THE
HAUNTED HOUSE,

21:08.433 --> 21:10.018
{\an8}SO I KNOW WHERE
EVERYTHING IS, SO...

21:10.102 --> 21:11.603
{\an8}- SO, YES?
- SO, NO.

21:11.687 --> 21:12.938
{\an8}- OH.

21:13.021 --> 21:14.982
{\an8}ALL RIGHT...PRETTY GOOD.
