00:38.480 --> 00:39.882
<i>Dear Michael,</i>

00:40.950 --> 00:42.282
<i>I read a story
the other night</i>

00:42.284 --> 00:43.752
<i>that I thought
you might like.</i>

00:44.820 --> 00:47.221
<i>The Legend of The Rusalka.</i>

00:50.459 --> 00:54.429
<i>The rusalka begins life
as an ordinary young woman.</i>

00:55.064 --> 00:56.931
<i>But then one day,
while love sick,</i>

00:56.933 --> 00:59.502
<i>she drowns
in a body of water.</i>

01:00.902 --> 01:03.438
<i>She wakes up transformed.</i>

01:04.072 --> 01:05.774
<i>A living ghost.</i>

01:06.475 --> 01:08.010
<i>A siren.</i>

01:08.643 --> 01:10.880
<i>Trapped in the lake
in which she died</i>

01:11.914 --> 01:15.451
<i>and she is forever cursed
with an unholy want</i>

01:16.385 --> 01:18.818
<i>to drown anyone
who comes near her again.</i>

01:24.093 --> 01:26.861
<i>I know you are just meat
and dirt now,</i>

01:26.863 --> 01:28.831
<i>somewhere in the lake.</i>

01:30.433 --> 01:32.900
<i>And I know that the story
is just a legend,</i>

01:32.902 --> 01:37.840
<i>but every day I hunt.</i>

01:39.075 --> 01:40.574
<i>And I swear to you,
my love,</i>

01:40.576 --> 01:43.077
<i>that I will find the thing
that killed you.</i>

01:43.079 --> 01:45.046
<i>And even if I lose
my life or my soul,</i>

01:45.048 --> 01:46.413
<i>I will kill it.</i>

01:46.415 --> 01:48.317
<i>And I will watch it die.</i>

01:48.952 --> 01:51.086
<i>And then... maybe,</i>

01:51.088 --> 01:53.556
<i>one day
I will see you again.</i>

02:12.408 --> 02:15.110
<i>I'm not sure how we're
going to manage without you.</i>

02:15.112 --> 02:17.478
<i>But, I recognize
that that's selfish,</i>

02:17.480 --> 02:19.783
<i>and the Lord has
a plan for you overseas.</i>

02:20.450 --> 02:22.717
<i>Okay, so, take a look
in your glove box.</i>

02:22.719 --> 02:24.588
<i>The church got you
a present.</i>

02:25.389 --> 02:26.320
<i>We're so proud of you</i>

02:26.322 --> 02:28.857
<i>and this long journey
you have ahead.</i>

02:28.859 --> 02:30.658
<i>And I'm going to be praying
for you on this trip,</i>

02:30.660 --> 02:31.793
<i>every day.</i>

02:31.795 --> 02:33.495
<i>Praise be to God.</i>

02:33.497 --> 02:35.664
<i>May you walk always
with Jesus Christ</i>

02:35.666 --> 02:37.599
<i>and keep the Devil
at bay.</i>

02:37.601 --> 02:39.401
<i>God loves you, Tom.</i>

02:39.403 --> 02:41.070
<i>Stay good.
Bye.</i>

07:12.380 --> 07:13.781
<i>Hi.</i>

07:14.983 --> 07:16.749
Can I help you?

07:25.960 --> 07:27.826
Oh!
I'm sorry!

07:27.828 --> 07:29.898
How can I help you?

07:34.802 --> 07:36.337
Right.

07:37.938 --> 07:40.375
<i>Do you know how
to turn on the power at the house?</i>

07:42.344 --> 07:45.945
The... That little
house right on the water.

07:45.947 --> 07:47.747
I think so.

07:47.749 --> 07:48.817
<i>Sweet!</i>

07:52.387 --> 07:54.156
That was quick.

07:54.788 --> 07:56.757
Alright.

08:05.066 --> 08:06.801
Okay.

08:10.405 --> 08:12.874
Steve and Anne
still own this place?

08:14.409 --> 08:16.776
Please apologize to them.

08:16.778 --> 08:17.879
For me.

08:20.081 --> 08:22.015
<i>When you were little</i>

08:22.017 --> 08:23.286
<i>you were swimming...</i>

08:25.154 --> 08:27.088
in a... in a river?

08:30.225 --> 08:32.159
Your throat got crushed.

08:34.297 --> 08:36.798
Jesus!
No wonder you hate swimming.

08:43.837 --> 08:45.707
My husband?

08:51.180 --> 08:53.282
Oh, he's great.

09:25.448 --> 09:26.448
<i>We have on the line,</i>

09:26.450 --> 09:28.916
<i>someone who claims
to have seen herself,</i>

09:28.918 --> 09:31.020
<i>what's been happening
in lake Argo.</i>

09:32.456 --> 09:34.922
<i>Now, Melissa.
What did you see?</i>

09:38.060 --> 09:39.594
<i>Melissa?</i>

09:39.596 --> 09:41.128
<i>Melissa, are you there?</i>

11:30.341 --> 11:32.043
<i>Dear Michael,</i>

11:33.512 --> 11:37.248
<i>I met someone today that,
reminds me a little of you!</i>

11:38.216 --> 11:41.350
<i>He is,
such an innocent.</i>

11:41.352 --> 11:43.520
<i>A colt of a man.</i>

11:43.522 --> 11:45.890
<i>Raised, basically,
by his church.</i>

11:48.627 --> 11:50.596
<i>Never been in love.</i>

11:51.562 --> 11:53.197
<i>Imagine that.</i>

11:54.298 --> 11:56.635
<i>I can't tell
if I pity him.</i>

15:51.740 --> 15:53.274
Hi.

15:55.377 --> 15:57.212
What's your name?

15:59.949 --> 16:01.884
Don't you talk?

16:04.854 --> 16:07.354
Oh... okay.

16:22.772 --> 16:25.939
I, usually just stop here
when I swim across,

16:25.941 --> 16:29.576
but usually no one's here.

16:29.578 --> 16:31.812
I also normally
don't look like this.

16:49.298 --> 16:50.564
Tom?

16:50.566 --> 16:52.234
Your name's Tom.

16:53.937 --> 16:55.504
I'm Nina.

18:57.095 --> 18:58.894
<i>Dear, Michael,</i>

18:58.896 --> 19:00.963
<i>I have seen the monster.</i>

19:00.965 --> 19:03.067
<i>The thing that
took you from me.</i>

19:09.141 --> 19:10.907
<i>I will avenge you,
my love.</i>

23:12.787 --> 23:14.356
Wait up, Mike.

23:17.658 --> 23:19.294
Mike?

28:51.765 --> 28:55.065
Hi!

29:05.211 --> 29:06.680
Where are you going?

29:17.290 --> 29:19.658
It's...
the other way around.

29:19.660 --> 29:21.428
In the boat.

29:42.784 --> 29:44.686
My earrings?

29:45.352 --> 29:47.221
What's wrong with them?

30:45.380 --> 30:47.081
You want to swim?

30:49.684 --> 30:51.486
Who doesn't like swimming?

30:57.326 --> 30:59.126
I could teach you.

31:01.696 --> 31:04.132
Okay, I guess I'll go then.

36:22.723 --> 36:23.888
I'm sorry.

36:23.890 --> 36:26.724
No no no,
I'm so sorry.

36:26.726 --> 36:28.561
I'm sorry.

36:28.995 --> 36:30.561
I'm so sorry.

36:39.740 --> 36:42.142
Are you okay?
I'm sorry.

39:30.712 --> 39:32.815
Didn't mean to scare you.

39:43.059 --> 39:46.362
I've been watching.

39:48.198 --> 39:50.065
And I want to warn you.

39:51.434 --> 39:52.899
I think that there's
something very bad

39:52.901 --> 39:54.803
that lives in this lake.

40:25.235 --> 40:27.704
Did you know
someone that died?

40:32.876 --> 40:34.844
I did, too.

40:56.800 --> 40:59.002
Sorry for your loss.

41:05.009 --> 41:07.178
I'm sorry, too.

41:39.276 --> 41:41.413
<i>Shh, I think it's him.
Tom?</i>

41:42.547 --> 41:44.846
<i>Tom... Tom, is that you?</i>

41:44.848 --> 41:47.116
<i>Okay, uh... Sorry, sorry.</i>

41:47.118 --> 41:49.420
<i>There's this chor...
Hold on a sec.</i>

41:51.055 --> 41:52.888
<i>Okay.
So, hold on one sec.</i>

41:52.890 --> 41:55.224
<i>There's a chorus here.
I'm just kinda trying to...</i>

41:55.226 --> 41:56.091
<i>Right. Okay.</i>

41:56.093 --> 41:57.125
<i>Sorry,
you'll have to remind me.</i>

41:57.127 --> 41:59.431
<i>One click is yes, right?</i>

42:02.968 --> 42:03.833
<i>...Real conversation.</i>

42:03.835 --> 42:05.401
<i>I guess you maybe
lost your phone?</i>

42:05.403 --> 42:07.169
<i>I'll try my best.
Can you hear me?</i>

42:07.171 --> 42:09.004
<i>Do you need me to call
the police or anything?</i>

42:10.575 --> 42:12.342
<i>We were so worried
about you.</i>

42:12.344 --> 42:13.977
<i>You missed your big flight.</i>

42:13.979 --> 42:17.113
<i>And you've never been
late for for anything</i>

42:17.115 --> 42:19.449
<i>or missed anything
that I can remember.</i>

42:19.451 --> 42:21.384
<i>We thought something
terrible had happened to you.</i>

42:21.386 --> 42:23.086
<i>Are you sure you're okay?</i>

42:24.389 --> 42:26.222
<i>Look, I know you
haven't really been</i>

42:26.224 --> 42:27.557
<i>outside of North Carolina</i>

42:27.559 --> 42:29.425
<i>and lots of people
in the world</i>

42:29.427 --> 42:32.495
<i>don't go to church
very much, anymore.</i>

42:32.497 --> 42:34.964
<i>Tom, I don't know what happened,
but I'm worried about you.</i>

42:34.966 --> 42:35.867
<i>I'm worried that you...</i>

42:40.605 --> 42:43.206
<i>...something has caused you to
stray,</i>

42:43.208 --> 42:44.974
<i>and I know you and I
disagree about this,</i>

42:44.976 --> 42:47.477
<i>but in this church
there's only one path forward,</i>

42:47.479 --> 42:49.415
<i>which is the path
of the Lord.</i>

42:55.154 --> 42:57.121
<i>...Is baptized will be saved,</i>

42:57.123 --> 42:59.922
<i>but whoever does not believe
will be condemned.</i>

42:59.924 --> 43:02.292
<i>That means going to Hell.</i>

43:02.294 --> 43:05.028
<i>The righteous will be glad
when they are avenged.</i>

43:05.030 --> 43:07.566
<i>When they bathe their feet
in the blood of the wicked.</i>

43:08.234 --> 43:10.567
<i>The sexually immoral.</i>

43:10.569 --> 43:12.571
<i>The idolators.</i>

44:24.377 --> 44:25.945
<i>Dear Michael,</i>

44:27.314 --> 44:28.546
<i>I've hated for so long</i>

44:28.548 --> 44:31.051
<i>I can't even tell
what's real.</i>

44:32.319 --> 44:34.085
<i>I thought I hated death,</i>

44:34.087 --> 44:35.553
<i>or some sort
of water demon,</i>

44:35.555 --> 44:37.991
<i>but, I realize now
that I hate...</i>

44:39.292 --> 44:41.024
<i>...you.</i>

44:41.026 --> 44:43.495
<i>The memory of you.</i>

44:43.497 --> 44:46.030
<i>Because it's made me this.</i>

44:46.032 --> 44:49.367
<i>A madman threatening
a woman with a machete.</i>

44:49.369 --> 44:51.004
<i>I hope she can forgive me.</i>

44:53.741 --> 44:56.411
<i>There is no monster.
That is absurd.</i>

44:58.745 --> 45:01.479
<i>And I am better off
without you or...</i>

45:01.481 --> 45:03.450
<i>...your memory.</i>

45:05.453 --> 45:08.121
<i>I will not think
of you again.</i>

45:33.046 --> 45:34.380
I didn't think
you'd still be here.

45:34.382 --> 45:36.317
I came to say hi
to the owners.

45:37.552 --> 45:40.288
No, I don't want to interrupt.
Company, huh?

45:45.426 --> 45:46.660
Oh, that girl
with black hair

45:46.662 --> 45:48.194
who's always in the lake?

45:49.464 --> 45:50.496
Well, she must be great

45:50.498 --> 45:52.700
because you are literally
blushing right now.

45:53.534 --> 45:55.036
How long have you
known her?

45:56.304 --> 45:57.804
One week.

45:57.806 --> 45:59.708
One day?

46:02.478 --> 46:04.511
You went swimming together?

46:11.486 --> 46:13.287
You love her?

46:16.325 --> 46:18.393
That's the most
important thing.

46:22.231 --> 46:25.032
Oh, no,
I should get back to...

46:31.640 --> 46:34.140
He's a yoga teacher.

46:34.142 --> 46:36.343
Believes in Buddhist stuff.

46:36.345 --> 46:38.245
Emptiness.

46:38.247 --> 46:40.081
Compassion.

46:41.550 --> 46:44.083
But he loves video games.

46:44.085 --> 46:46.154
He beats me all the time.

46:46.588 --> 46:49.558
And he would just
taunt me like... bad.

46:50.559 --> 46:53.563
And he says weird-ass
stuff in his sleep, and...

47:22.391 --> 47:24.159
Hey, killer.

47:25.261 --> 47:27.395
I'm not crashing your, um.

47:27.397 --> 47:28.932
He made me.

47:32.802 --> 47:35.603
This guy literally
never shuts up.

47:35.605 --> 47:37.407
I know.

47:45.348 --> 47:47.083
Oh.

47:48.384 --> 47:49.784
I'm a vegetarian.

47:49.786 --> 47:51.654
It's a veggie burger.

48:29.292 --> 48:31.394
Oh, ha.

48:32.730 --> 48:34.331
Oh, no, um.

48:35.633 --> 48:38.602
Okay, uh, yeah.
It's a...

48:40.403 --> 48:41.703
Yeah.

48:41.705 --> 48:42.740
Cool.

48:43.574 --> 48:45.308
What is it?

48:46.209 --> 48:47.909
Oh, no, I mean obviously
it's a...

48:47.911 --> 48:49.713
- It's a fish!
- It's a flute.

49:04.495 --> 49:05.995
He's a good guy.

49:05.997 --> 49:07.899
Terrible whittler.

49:10.568 --> 49:12.336
Listen, um...

49:12.971 --> 49:14.805
I'm sorry...

49:16.240 --> 49:18.776
about talking
with you earlier.

49:21.645 --> 49:24.415
It's been a very bad year.

49:26.250 --> 49:27.919
Few years.

49:29.487 --> 49:31.321
I wanted...

50:53.572 --> 50:55.708
Shh...

51:02.114 --> 51:03.883
You should run.

51:04.483 --> 51:06.051
Now.

51:40.586 --> 51:42.622
Sorry. Um...

51:49.895 --> 51:52.498
I'm not what you think I am.

51:54.034 --> 51:55.767
Goodbye.

54:32.128 --> 54:34.263
All the drownings...

54:36.165 --> 54:37.767
They were all me.

54:42.604 --> 54:43.603
I can't stop.

54:43.605 --> 54:47.709
It's like trying to stop
your heart from beating.

54:51.914 --> 54:54.117
Except with you.

57:04.115 --> 57:05.548
Hi.

57:05.550 --> 57:07.817
- Okay, so just only use the black keys.
- Only use the black keys.

57:07.819 --> 57:09.285
And then you can just do
whatever you want.

57:09.287 --> 57:11.020
- You should've taught me this before we made the video.
- No, okay.

57:11.022 --> 57:12.388
Just do whatever you want.
That's the rules.

57:12.390 --> 57:13.490
It's really great.

57:13.492 --> 57:14.423
- Whatever I... I'll start. I'll start.
- Okay.

57:21.366 --> 57:23.134
- Just anything you want.
- It's good!

57:27.172 --> 57:29.341
Yup.

57:31.742 --> 57:33.677
- This is lovely.
- Go crazy!

01:02:23.638 --> 01:02:26.473
Just so you know, um...

01:02:26.475 --> 01:02:28.711
I'm also a girl.

01:02:31.179 --> 01:02:33.216
At least I think so.

01:02:34.517 --> 01:02:36.219
Pretty sure.

01:02:50.834 --> 01:02:52.801
I was going to cry.

01:02:52.803 --> 01:02:54.368
Oh God...
