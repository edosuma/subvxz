WEBVTT

00:19.353 --> 00:20.395
And?

00:21.480 --> 00:23.023
What if it's not what you want?

00:25.150 --> 00:26.235
I want what you want.

00:28.195 --> 00:29.488
Ezra...

00:29.488 --> 00:33.367
So, is she or isn't she?

00:36.662 --> 00:37.663
Guess.

00:40.165 --> 00:41.166
Just tell me.

00:44.753 --> 00:47.464
- Guess.
- Please.

00:54.596 --> 00:55.722
Really?

00:58.559 --> 00:59.476
Great.

00:59.977 --> 01:01.603
- Great?
- Yeah.

01:01.603 --> 01:02.729
Yeah?

01:03.981 --> 01:05.232
Yes.

01:08.735 --> 01:09.903
We're having--

01:10.821 --> 01:12.531
- We're having a baby.
- That's great.

01:14.908 --> 01:15.909
Play again.

01:21.331 --> 01:22.332
And?

01:23.125 --> 01:24.960
<i>What if it's not what you want?</i>

01:26.795 --> 01:28.046
<i>I want what you want.</i>

01:29.006 --> 01:30.174
<i>Ezra...</i>

01:30.174 --> 01:34.178
<i>So, is she or isn't she?</i>

01:36.972 --> 01:37.973
<i>Guess.</i>

01:40.475 --> 01:41.476
<i>Just tell me.</i>

01:43.020 --> 01:44.605
<i>Guess.</i>

02:03.040 --> 02:06.126
Close memory asset: Lola.

02:08.878 --> 02:10.088
Raise bed.

02:46.291 --> 02:47.292
Hello, David.

03:40.804 --> 03:45.392
The fierce and formidable
mama jaguar hunts for her cub, Joey.

03:46.685 --> 03:49.980
But this time,
she underestimates her prey.

03:55.652 --> 03:57.112
Daddy.

04:00.449 --> 04:03.577
Mom said that jaguars will come back
in my lifetime.

04:05.746 --> 04:07.122
They're working on it.

04:07.122 --> 04:08.665
Did you ever meet one before?

04:08.665 --> 04:10.709
Jaguar? No.

04:12.503 --> 04:13.837
But I met a whale once.

04:15.005 --> 04:16.298
The last whale.

04:16.298 --> 04:18.509
You never told me that story.

04:21.637 --> 04:22.763
Maybe another time.

04:23.388 --> 04:25.891
Please, please, please?
Tell me about the whale.

04:30.020 --> 04:31.104
Tell me!

04:31.104 --> 04:34.608
Okay. Time for bed. Next visit,
you can hear the whale story. Okay?

04:35.734 --> 04:36.860
Promise?

04:39.613 --> 04:40.739
Promise.

04:41.782 --> 04:43.325
All right. Go to sleep.

04:51.083 --> 04:52.167
Good night.

05:01.844 --> 05:03.929
She's really opening up to me now.

05:05.180 --> 05:06.181
That's great.

05:08.642 --> 05:10.018
Same time next week?

05:10.602 --> 05:11.603
Sure.

05:13.730 --> 05:16.817
Actually, no.
There's a parent-teacher conference.

05:17.526 --> 05:19.903
- Do your services include that?
- They do.

05:19.903 --> 05:22.906
Schools like to be acquainted
with the full support system,

05:24.241 --> 05:25.576
even the hired stand-ins.

05:26.827 --> 05:28.912
I'm happy to make myself available.

05:32.040 --> 05:33.250
You okay?

05:33.250 --> 05:35.085
Did I do something wrong?

05:35.752 --> 05:36.879
The pinky swear.

05:37.588 --> 05:39.006
It caught me off guard.

05:39.840 --> 05:43.468
- How did you know to do that?
- Let me explain.

05:45.512 --> 05:46.513
May I?

05:49.141 --> 05:50.142
Yeah.

05:52.436 --> 05:55.689
When you chose me,
I was given access to a library

05:55.689 --> 05:58.859
of your memory assets,
and that helped me prepare for the role.

06:00.611 --> 06:03.280
So, here's the David listing.

06:03.280 --> 06:05.407
They scraped these off social media
and other apps.

06:05.407 --> 06:07.784
- <i>You still don't believe me?</i>
- <i>It's not for me.</i>

06:07.784 --> 06:10.579
<i>This is for her.
She may want to see this one day.</i>

06:10.579 --> 06:12.581
- <i>Come on.</i>
- <i>I love you. I love you.</i>

06:13.624 --> 06:14.750
<i>Promise?</i>

06:17.377 --> 06:18.378
<i>Come on.</i>

06:18.378 --> 06:20.839
<i>Harlyn, are you watching?</i>

06:22.174 --> 06:24.009
<i>I promise, all right?</i>

06:25.636 --> 06:28.680
<i>You hear that, girlie? I love your mother.</i>

06:28.680 --> 06:32.601
My interactions with you have
a big impact on how Harlyn sees me.

06:32.601 --> 06:36.855
A continuation of the old dynamics,
that's what they teach us.

06:36.855 --> 06:39.149
Maybe I don't want to return
to old dynamics.

06:40.234 --> 06:43.570
I want you to be a father to Harlyn,
not a replica of someone else.

06:44.655 --> 06:48.742
Okay. That explains
why you didn't want me to use his accent.

06:50.536 --> 06:53.664
Usually my clients want
to replace someone they lost.

06:54.289 --> 06:58.126
The resemblance is
to help suspend disbelief, fill a void.

06:59.628 --> 07:00.796
I'll keep it in mind.

07:06.301 --> 07:08.303
- Yeah, all right.
- See you soon.

07:13.559 --> 07:15.352
<i>New notification.</i>

07:22.943 --> 07:24.653
<i>Ezra. This is Janice,</i>

07:24.653 --> 07:27.531
- <i>your Cache Cloud representative.</i>
- I know who you are, Janice.

07:27.531 --> 07:32.077
<i>Due to the rise in global temperatures,
your monthly fee will be increasing.</i>

07:32.077 --> 07:35.789
<i>To accept the increase,
you need not take any action at all.</i>

07:35.789 --> 07:39.001
- <i>To make an appointment, simply request--</i>
- Appointment.

07:39.877 --> 07:41.795
<i>Reminder: Change eye color.</i>

07:54.183 --> 07:56.727
- Name and account number, please?
- Ezra Haddad.

07:56.727 --> 07:58.812
There you are. How can I help you?

07:58.812 --> 08:01.648
I don't understand.
This is the third increase this year.

08:01.648 --> 08:05.194
Cache Cloud server farms automatically
adjust to global temperatures,

08:05.194 --> 08:09.239
and that protects the blockchain,
which, more importantly, protects you.

08:09.239 --> 08:12.451
Right, but the blockchain
sucks up all sorts of energy.

08:12.451 --> 08:16.663
Exactly. So when the temperatures rise,
so do the prices.

08:16.663 --> 08:19.458
Need to keep those storage farms cool.

08:19.458 --> 08:22.002
Really a shame
everyone let it get this far.

08:22.002 --> 08:25.547
And the geoengineering debacle
a few years back only made things worse,

08:25.547 --> 08:26.757
if you ask me.

08:26.757 --> 08:31.011
But Mind's Eye has become
our most popular offering.

08:31.011 --> 08:34.515
It's the only way to truly be present
in your own memories.

08:34.515 --> 08:37.768
Our proprietary tech stimulates
the parietal lobe

08:37.768 --> 08:40.979
- with noninvasive electromag--
- I know how it works, Janice.

08:40.979 --> 08:46.318
Did you know that most of our clients see
their storage plans as investments?

08:46.318 --> 08:52.032
Stashing away parts of themselves until
their entire consciousness can be uploaded

08:52.032 --> 08:54.117
and brought back when
this mess is all sorted.

08:54.117 --> 08:58.580
Look, I need Mind's Eye now,
not a hundred years from now.

08:58.580 --> 09:02.209
If I don't have the visual stimuli,
I'd lose the entire memory.

09:02.209 --> 09:05.337
Oh, yes. Summer heart.

09:06.213 --> 09:09.132
I have a cousin with the same condition.
Poor thing.

09:09.132 --> 09:11.635
She started having life gaps
by the time she was 16.

09:11.635 --> 09:13.846
- That's what I'm trying to avoid.
- Of course.

09:16.723 --> 09:20.352
I see you've never missed
a daily memory sync. That's excellent.

09:20.352 --> 09:23.105
And that's why you're getting
the Cache Cloud summer heart discount,

09:23.105 --> 09:26.233
an almost 10% reduction.

09:27.276 --> 09:30.988
But you're raising prices by 15%, so...

09:30.988 --> 09:32.906
If you can't afford the rate increase,

09:32.906 --> 09:34.908
you'll need to change your storage plan.

09:34.908 --> 09:37.828
Otherwise, you will need
to let some things go.

09:37.828 --> 09:41.331
Yeah? What? What do I lose?

09:41.331 --> 09:44.293
We'll work our way
through your least-visited assets.

09:44.293 --> 09:47.004
Don't worry.
You won't even notice they're gone.

09:47.671 --> 09:49.464
That's the beauty of forgetting.

09:53.677 --> 09:55.012
It's up to you.

09:58.515 --> 10:01.518
Delete. Delete.

10:08.901 --> 10:11.069
Del-- No, preserve.

10:13.071 --> 10:14.823
Never mind. Delete.

10:17.367 --> 10:18.410
Delete.

10:20.078 --> 10:21.288
Preserve.

10:22.080 --> 10:23.123
Delete.

10:24.333 --> 10:25.876
Delete. Preserve.

10:25.876 --> 10:28.837
<i>Do you have someone in your life
who struggles with heat rage?</i>

10:28.837 --> 10:33.050
<i>Do rising temperatures cause you
and your loved ones fear and anxiety?</i>

10:33.550 --> 10:35.844
<i>Last year alone, over 10,000 people</i>

10:35.844 --> 10:39.431
<i>in London were victims
of violence caused by heat rage.</i>

10:39.431 --> 10:42.434
<i>But there is a solution. CRISPR.</i>

10:42.935 --> 10:46.355
Ezra, stop at a Geno CRISPR Clinic
for more information.

10:46.355 --> 10:48.565
Help your special someone keep their cool.

10:58.617 --> 11:01.620
Yo. Yo, yo, yo. 2753.

11:03.330 --> 11:07.084
Whoever programmed those delivery drones,
fucking idiots.

11:07.918 --> 11:09.169
Yeah, it's a late one for you.

11:09.169 --> 11:11.380
I had to extend my appointment slot.

11:12.297 --> 11:13.549
Cache keeps upping my premium.

11:14.132 --> 11:16.176
Hey, I've got a guy who's

11:16.176 --> 11:19.346
just set up a farmer service
in Norilsk, Siberia.

11:19.346 --> 11:22.266
He-- It's off the grid.
He runs his own network.

11:22.266 --> 11:24.226
It's way cheaper than your Dosh Cloud.

11:24.226 --> 11:25.519
Way cheaper.

11:26.311 --> 11:27.938
I don't want to take any chances.

11:27.938 --> 11:32.067
All I'm going to say is,
Mother Nature is the great equalizer.

11:32.067 --> 11:33.569
Mother Nature.

11:40.951 --> 11:43.328
- <i>Welcome home, Ezra.</i>
- Thanks.

11:44.204 --> 11:45.414
How was my day?

11:46.248 --> 11:47.291
Great.

11:47.833 --> 11:49.084
Appreciate your asking.

11:50.294 --> 11:51.587
How was yours?

11:53.338 --> 11:54.715
Wardrobe, David.

11:56.425 --> 11:59.178
Launch Pack. Review schedule for tomorrow.

12:00.429 --> 12:04.516
<i>Your first appointment
is with client Derek at 1100 hours.</i>

12:05.100 --> 12:07.978
<i>You will be required to have blue eyes
and speak French.</i>

12:08.562 --> 12:11.315
- <i>Derek has sent you a package containing--</i>
- Got it.

12:11.315 --> 12:14.443
<i>Your second appointment
is with client Dariya.</i>

12:14.443 --> 12:18.071
- <i>You will be required--</i>
- Her son. I know.

12:18.071 --> 12:22.034
<i>You will be required
to wear a kufi, a scar, glasses,</i>

12:22.034 --> 12:23.285
<i>and speak Arabic.</i>

12:25.037 --> 12:27.372
<i>No additional appointments for tomorrow.</i>

12:28.040 --> 12:29.333
Lower bed.

12:37.007 --> 12:38.467
Time slips away from us

12:38.467 --> 12:40.886
but leaves its imprint behind.

12:43.597 --> 12:44.848
Launch Cache.

12:49.019 --> 12:50.646
Initiate memory sync.

12:51.897 --> 12:55.359
<i>Make yourself comfortable.
Take a deep breath.</i>

12:55.359 --> 12:58.695
<i>As you exhale, gently close your eyes.</i>

12:58.695 --> 13:03.242
<i>Recall your day
from the moment you woke up until now.</i>

13:05.202 --> 13:07.287
<i>Memory assets synced.</i>

13:08.455 --> 13:09.665
Open Lola.

13:10.415 --> 13:11.458
Lifeline.

13:12.042 --> 13:16.171
<i>However,
CO2 levels increased at the fastest rate...</i>

13:25.514 --> 13:26.932
Your lifeline...

13:26.932 --> 13:29.560
- What?
- This break.

13:31.061 --> 13:34.189
It means you will face a momentous change.

13:35.691 --> 13:37.234
Play again.

13:37.234 --> 13:38.569
Continuous.

13:38.569 --> 13:39.945
<i>Your lifeline...</i>

13:40.445 --> 13:42.948
- <i>What?</i>
- <i>This break...</i>

14:00.299 --> 14:04.511
Time slips away from us,
but leaves its imprint behind.

14:10.142 --> 14:11.435
Champagne, please.

14:13.687 --> 14:15.063
You like it?

14:15.063 --> 14:17.149
As much as I did the first time
you gave it to me.

14:17.149 --> 14:20.360
I thought I lost it
in the Rotterdam evacuation...

14:22.863 --> 14:23.697
So...

14:24.489 --> 14:25.741
Tell me, how was your trip?

14:26.200 --> 14:27.701
I don't know what to say--

14:27.701 --> 14:29.453
25 years ago, we thought crypto

14:29.453 --> 14:30.913
was going to be our salvation;

14:30.913 --> 14:33.165
now it is killing us
with the carbon footprint.

14:37.836 --> 14:39.630
- Good afternoon.
- Hello.

14:42.466 --> 14:44.551
<i>Is there anyone special?</i>

14:44.551 --> 14:46.428
<i>There is, isn't there?</i>

14:48.514 --> 14:49.556
It's early days still...

14:49.932 --> 14:53.185
You like her. More than you think.

14:54.144 --> 14:55.771
I can tell.

14:56.855 --> 15:00.025
She wants to make your qatayef recipe
for Ramadan.

15:00.025 --> 15:01.652
I told her how we used to.

15:01.652 --> 15:03.153
You remember--

15:03.153 --> 15:04.404
Of course, I do.

15:04.404 --> 15:07.115
I used to take another helping
when you weren't looking

15:07.115 --> 15:08.700
and hide and eat it.

15:09.034 --> 15:10.577
You should have this--

15:10.577 --> 15:12.704
No. I can't--

15:12.704 --> 15:14.957
Don't wait too long.

15:14.957 --> 15:18.627
You never know what could happen
in this world...

15:19.878 --> 15:22.548
Do you think you could bring her
next time?

15:22.548 --> 15:24.800
I'd love to meet her.

15:26.093 --> 15:27.845
God...

15:27.845 --> 15:30.514
I love the smell of the flowers...

15:30.973 --> 15:32.307
What are they?

15:33.475 --> 15:34.768
Lavender.

15:36.103 --> 15:37.271
Right?

15:41.650 --> 15:42.943
Lavender.

15:48.073 --> 15:50.075
I love the smell of lavender.

15:53.579 --> 15:57.124
You should go outside today. It's safe.

15:58.959 --> 16:00.294
I wanna be here.

16:00.878 --> 16:03.255
You're afraid you're gonna
miss something?

16:04.965 --> 16:06.884
I'm gonna miss everything.

16:21.440 --> 16:23.358
I love the smell of lavender.

16:34.328 --> 16:36.830
Launch Cache. Open Lola.

16:38.040 --> 16:39.875
<i>I love the smell of lavender.</i>

16:41.627 --> 16:45.255
<i>You should go outside today. It's safe.</i>

16:45.756 --> 16:46.965

16:49.009 --> 16:51.094
You're afraid you're gonna miss something?

16:53.305 --> 16:54.723
I'm gonna miss everything.

16:55.849 --> 16:59.520
It happened twice this week.
I could see it in my mind, and then...

17:00.938 --> 17:01.855
it was gone.

17:02.606 --> 17:04.733
I had to use Cache Cloud to bring it back.

17:05.442 --> 17:07.486
<i>This is your most recent scan.</i>

17:07.486 --> 17:11.531
<i>A healthy human brain contains
over 86 billion active neurons.</i>

17:12.074 --> 17:15.702
<i>What we're seeing here is evidence
the dendrite structures are breaking down.</i>

17:15.702 --> 17:21.290
<i>An 11% decline of active synapses,
signifying death of neurons.</i>

17:22.084 --> 17:25.712
<i>Ezra, your brain has been stressed
by a lifetime of summer heart.</i>

17:26.213 --> 17:29.675
<i>Due to the historical reduction
of blood flow to your brain,</i>

17:30.175 --> 17:34.179
<i>the damage to vessels,
the ongoing inflammation,</i>

17:34.680 --> 17:37.099
<i>vascular dementia was inevitable.</i>

17:37.099 --> 17:39.977
<i>Our bodies weren't built
for these temperatures.</i>

17:39.977 --> 17:42.020
<i>We keep developing new technologies</i>

17:42.020 --> 17:44.565
<i>to try and address everything
but the root problem,</i>

17:44.565 --> 17:47.401
<i>and all the while,
the temperatures keep going up.</i>

17:47.401 --> 17:50.279
All right, so how do we stop it?

17:50.279 --> 17:53.991
<i>Sadly, this is the beginning
of the accelerated cognitive decline</i>

17:53.991 --> 17:55.367
<i>we've been preparing for.</i>

17:55.367 --> 17:58.579
<i>There's no way
to reverse the loss of brain cells.</i>

17:58.579 --> 18:00.539
But I thought Mind's Eye could fix it.

18:01.039 --> 18:05.294
<i>Yes. The visual and auditory stimuli
from Mind's Eye is the best way</i>

18:05.294 --> 18:07.796
<i>to slow down onset of the dementia.</i>

18:08.505 --> 18:11.091
<i>By revisiting memories
in their purest form,</i>

18:11.091 --> 18:13.594
<i>it tricks the brain
into thinking that they're new again.</i>

18:14.219 --> 18:15.637
<i>But that won't stop the decay.</i>

18:15.637 --> 18:17.472
There's nothing else we can do?

18:17.472 --> 18:20.475
<i>Some of my patients experiment
with surrogates.</i>

18:20.475 --> 18:23.145
<i>Others have been trying
nostalgia-based therapy.</i>

18:23.145 --> 18:24.229
What's that?

18:24.229 --> 18:26.899
<i>The way it works,
you create a verbal placeholder</i>

18:26.899 --> 18:30.569
<i>based on four sensory signifiers
of a cornerstone memory.</i>

18:30.569 --> 18:32.905
<i>Four words, like a mantra.</i>

18:32.905 --> 18:35.115
The words, not visuals?

18:35.115 --> 18:38.327
<i>The theory is that this practice
will strengthen neural pathways</i>

18:38.327 --> 18:40.162
<i>through repetition of the words.</i>

18:40.704 --> 18:42.164
That's really gonna work?

18:43.624 --> 18:45.667
By mumbling words to myself?

18:46.293 --> 18:49.087
<i>Like I said, just a theory.</i>

18:53.217 --> 18:54.468
Thank you, Doctor.

18:56.428 --> 18:58.680
<i>Well, this is where we were
at six months ago.</i>

18:58.680 --> 19:04.019
The placement of the family indicated
that Harlyn was feeling insecure.

19:04.937 --> 19:07.689
The dark clouds suggested her anxiety.

19:08.357 --> 19:12.653
And now,
well, clearly things have changed.

19:12.653 --> 19:15.781
There's an increased security
with the family unit.

19:15.781 --> 19:19.409
We see it in the blue clouds
and now the sun being out.

19:23.580 --> 19:25.374
I know this is just a job for you,

19:25.374 --> 19:29.628
but I just wanted to say thank you.

19:29.628 --> 19:33.757
I'm glad it's been worthwhile.
She really is amazing.

19:37.302 --> 19:38.720
We'll see you next week?

19:48.480 --> 19:51.525
Natasha, you still have about an hour.

19:51.525 --> 19:55.028
I mean, you don't have to use it,
but it's yours if you want.

19:57.739 --> 19:58.824
Wanna get a drink?

20:05.497 --> 20:07.457
<i>A lot of people now, they just--</i>

20:07.457 --> 20:11.420
<i>The idea of even having children
in this world is too much for them,</i>

20:11.420 --> 20:13.505
<i>so it feels lucky to have you.</i>

20:13.505 --> 20:14.840
Thanks.

20:15.924 --> 20:18.635
I just didn't think I'd be doing it alone.

20:20.971 --> 20:22.598
I guess I'm not.

20:25.601 --> 20:26.685
Sorry.

20:27.394 --> 20:30.439
I need to remember,
I didn't hire you for me.

20:32.608 --> 20:33.817
Thank you.

20:34.943 --> 20:36.195
Are there other Davids?

20:39.031 --> 20:40.073
Occasionally.

20:41.033 --> 20:43.202
I mean, it's not like you offer
the sensory experience.

20:43.202 --> 20:45.787
- No, I don't.
- Don't wanna get your hands dirty?

20:48.624 --> 20:50.167
That's just a boundary I set.

20:51.460 --> 20:56.048
I don't only use details of him,
I put some of myself into the role too.

20:57.758 --> 21:00.719
I'm aware I'm being serviced.
I'm not delusional.

21:02.638 --> 21:07.184
Sometimes,
I do miss the discovery of another person.

21:08.852 --> 21:10.145
An authentic connection.

21:13.065 --> 21:16.944
But that's so rare... it's not worth...

21:18.946 --> 21:21.031
Maybe transactional
is the best we can hope for.

21:24.660 --> 21:28.247
You know, it's terrible,
but sometimes I wish he was dead,

21:28.247 --> 21:29.706
instead of just gone.

21:29.706 --> 21:31.250
He's alive?

21:31.250 --> 21:32.543
Maybe.

21:33.126 --> 21:34.127
I wouldn't know.

21:38.382 --> 21:41.218
He was on a work trip in the States.

21:41.218 --> 21:42.761
Oregon.

21:43.554 --> 21:46.807
He called
and told me he wasn't coming home.

21:48.475 --> 21:51.854
He'd met someone
at a Heal the Land colony,

21:51.854 --> 21:54.106
something like that.

21:56.066 --> 21:58.110
He became someone else.

22:04.157 --> 22:05.409
I'm sorry, Nat...

22:07.661 --> 22:09.872
that I haven't been there
for the two of you.

22:12.165 --> 22:14.168
I don't know what I was thinking.

22:16.128 --> 22:17.462
I was scared...

22:20.340 --> 22:21.800
scared of the world.

22:25.929 --> 22:26.972
I'm sorry.

22:32.102 --> 22:33.478
You're good.

22:35.147 --> 22:36.356
You're very good.

22:37.566 --> 22:39.234
You're a better David than David,

22:39.985 --> 22:41.236
whoever you are.

22:46.700 --> 22:47.826
Time's up.

22:52.247 --> 22:55.792
<i>Reminder:
Change eye color before next appointment.</i>

22:58.921 --> 23:01.381
<i>Your next appointment
is with client Dariya.</i>

23:01.882 --> 23:05.802
<i>You will be required to wear a kufi,
glasses, a scar and speak Arabic.</i>

23:05.802 --> 23:07.012
Okay, glasses.

23:08.722 --> 23:09.765
Glasses.

23:10.641 --> 23:12.684
Oh, shit!

23:26.949 --> 23:28.700
Hi, can I help you?

23:29.368 --> 23:30.536
Yes.

23:31.119 --> 23:33.247
Where is my mother, Dariya Sulaiman?

23:36.583 --> 23:38.377
I'm so sorry.

23:43.549 --> 23:45.217
Why didn't anyone contact me?

23:45.217 --> 23:48.262
I apologize if there's been some kind
of mistake.

23:48.262 --> 23:50.514
There was no next of kin listed
on her file.

23:51.765 --> 23:52.850
Who exactly are you?

23:58.772 --> 24:00.524
It's my mistake.

24:12.369 --> 24:16.123
Heal the land. Heal the land.

24:16.623 --> 24:20.252
Heal the land. Heal the land.

24:21.003 --> 24:22.462
Heal the land.

24:41.231 --> 24:44.067
- <i>Delivery sent.</i>
- Launch Cache.

24:49.531 --> 24:51.742
Initiate memory sync.

24:52.242 --> 24:53.452
<i>Mr. Haddad,</i>

24:53.452 --> 24:58.457
<i>I regret to inform you that you have
exceeded your storage plan by 4.08%.</i>

24:58.457 --> 25:00.459
<i>If you want to keep using our services,</i>

25:00.459 --> 25:04.796
<i>you must upgrade your
Mind's Eye Cache Cloud storage plan now.</i>

25:04.796 --> 25:06.924
- I can't fucking upgrade.
- <i>For your convenience,</i>

25:06.924 --> 25:10.302
<i>these are your
least accessed memory assets.</i>

25:12.346 --> 25:13.430
<i>Please advise.</i>

25:14.640 --> 25:15.849
<i>Will you be deleting?</i>

25:15.849 --> 25:17.017
Uh-uh. No.

25:18.101 --> 25:20.646
No, I'm not deleting my life.

25:30.614 --> 25:34.493
<i>So, is she or isn't she?</i>

25:36.119 --> 25:37.663
Guess.

25:47.589 --> 25:48.799
Call Doctor Zollner.

25:50.592 --> 25:52.553
<i>Doctor Zollner is not available.</i>

25:52.553 --> 25:55.597
- <i>If this is an emergency, please contact--</i>
- Disconnect.

25:57.307 --> 25:59.560
Okay, okay.

26:00.602 --> 26:01.687
Four words.

26:05.357 --> 26:06.567
Brown eyes,

26:07.651 --> 26:09.069
guess,

26:09.820 --> 26:10.946
lavender,

26:12.072 --> 26:13.198
Lola.

26:18.078 --> 26:22.666
Brown eyes, guess, lavender, Lola.

26:23.917 --> 26:33.218
Brown eyes, guess, lavender, Lola.

26:34.052 --> 26:39.266
Brown eyes, guess, lavender, Lola.

26:40.142 --> 26:42.853
Brown eyes, guess, lavender, Lola.

26:42.853 --> 26:44.479
Brown eyes--

26:45.147 --> 26:46.940
- Brown eyes, guess, lavender...
- Lavender.

26:46.940 --> 26:48.942
Brown eyes, guess, lavender...

26:50.944 --> 26:54.406
Brown eyes, guess, lavender, Lola.

26:54.406 --> 26:58.702
<i>Brown eyes, guess, lavender, Lola.</i>

27:00.245 --> 27:02.539
<i>Brown eyes, guess--</i>

27:03.332 --> 27:06.543
Brown eyes, guess, lavender, Lola...

27:06.543 --> 27:08.337
I miss you.

27:13.217 --> 27:14.426
Open Pack.

27:23.519 --> 27:24.645
Ezra?

27:26.230 --> 27:27.356
There you are.

27:32.194 --> 27:35.489
I understand from your Pack profile
that this is your first time.

27:36.156 --> 27:38.575
Is there anything you'd like
to discuss before we begin?

27:41.787 --> 27:43.038
I have summer heart.

27:43.038 --> 27:44.373
I'm sorry.

27:44.373 --> 27:46.708
Well, they cured it, but my brain--

27:48.043 --> 27:49.294
I'm losing my memories.

27:50.546 --> 27:51.755
I bet I can help.

27:52.673 --> 27:54.341
I get very high ratings.

27:54.341 --> 27:55.551
I'm sure.

27:57.094 --> 27:58.720
Usually, I'm in your shoes.

28:00.472 --> 28:01.974
Actually, I'm part of the Pack.

28:05.686 --> 28:09.898
Well, you didn't have a lot of assets,
but I liked what I saw.

28:11.108 --> 28:12.693
And I've worked with less.

28:22.744 --> 28:23.829
Your lifeline...

28:28.625 --> 28:29.793
What?

28:29.793 --> 28:31.253
This break.

28:32.171 --> 28:35.090
It means you will face a momentous change.

29:08.874 --> 29:09.875
What?

29:10.834 --> 29:13.295
Sorry, it's just... your tattoo.

29:14.546 --> 29:15.881
She didn't have one.

29:17.716 --> 29:21.720
I couldn't tell from the assets.
Don't worry about it.

29:23.013 --> 29:24.806
I don't think this is gonna work.

29:25.432 --> 29:29.144
Did you have a happy birthday, Ezra?

29:35.025 --> 29:37.945
Did you have a happy birthday, Ezra?

29:41.949 --> 29:44.284
- It's not over yet.
- It's not over yet.

29:45.869 --> 29:50.958
<i>It's not over yet.</i>

29:50.958 --> 29:55.254
<i>It's not over yet. It's not over yet.</i>

29:56.213 --> 29:57.381
It's not over.

30:11.520 --> 30:13.564
You can call me Lola if you want.

30:23.615 --> 30:24.950
- What?
- I'm sorry.

30:24.950 --> 30:26.034
Ezra, what?

30:30.998 --> 30:32.708
I just-- I mean, you're not her.

30:32.708 --> 30:36.128
It's-- It's not gonna work.
It's-- It's not the same.

30:36.128 --> 30:38.755
It's-- It's not real.

30:39.673 --> 30:43.552
Hey, hey, let's talk about this.

30:44.595 --> 30:45.888
I can adjust.

30:52.728 --> 30:54.188
Stop it. Sorry, I'm just--

30:57.566 --> 30:58.942
Just go, please.

31:06.450 --> 31:08.493
Sorry, you'll still have to pay.

31:10.495 --> 31:12.831
3,000 units.

31:25.135 --> 31:26.303
Open Cache.

31:29.056 --> 31:30.057

31:30.057 --> 31:32.726
<i>Your account remains over capacity.</i>

31:32.726 --> 31:37.272
<i>All assets, contacts, correspondence

31:37.272 --> 31:41.068
Fuck off, Janice. Listen, just fuck off!

31:41.068 --> 31:44.780
<i>Would you like to delete
these memory assets?</i>

31:46.782 --> 31:47.783
Delete.

31:50.160 --> 31:53.288
<i>You are now 1.47% over capacity.</i>

31:59.294 --> 32:00.295
Delete.

32:01.797 --> 32:03.507
Delete all assets

32:03.507 --> 32:05.843
except for those with key word "Lola."

32:05.843 --> 32:09.137
<i>Congratulations.
Your account is now in good standing.</i>

32:09.137 --> 32:12.808
<i>Thank you for entrusting your memories

32:23.944 --> 32:25.028
<i>This break...</i>

32:28.198 --> 32:30.534

32:41.879 --> 32:44.089

- What--

32:47.176 --> 32:49.469
Open Natasha assets.

32:49.469 --> 32:50.888
<i>Not detected.</i>

32:50.888 --> 32:53.182
<i>Next stop: Charing Cross Road.</i>

32:53.182 --> 32:54.933
It's not going to work, I'm afraid.

32:55.517 --> 32:56.768
What?

32:56.768 --> 32:58.270
Everything's gone.

32:58.270 --> 32:59.771
What are you talking about?

32:59.771 --> 33:01.815
Earthquake crashed all the servers.

33:01.815 --> 33:03.775
What-- An earthquake, you said?

33:03.775 --> 33:07.738
Sea level change, more water,
more weight on the tectonic plates.

33:07.738 --> 33:11.325
They said it was coming.
Tsunami in Nova Scotia.

33:11.325 --> 33:13.660
People use blockchain.
Blockchain uses power.

33:14.203 --> 33:18.707
Power makes the sea level rise
which, in turn, wipes blockchain clean.

33:22.169 --> 33:25.881
The Internet is back up.
But the Cloud, it's all blown away.

33:26.381 --> 33:28.509
A good day to start your entire life over.

33:30.636 --> 33:32.846
Launch Cache. Open Lola.

34:11.552 --> 34:13.262
- Hey!
- Excuse me.

34:13.262 --> 34:14.763
Hey!

34:14.763 --> 34:16.598
I wanna know where my memory assets are.

34:16.598 --> 34:19.601
You may recall the force majeure clause
in your contract.

34:19.601 --> 34:22.896
As you can imagine,
a natural disaster qualifies

34:22.896 --> 34:25.274
as an extraordinary occurrence
beyond our control.

34:25.274 --> 34:27.818
Fucking dendrites
are going dark every day.

34:27.818 --> 34:29.277
I need Mind's Eye.

34:29.277 --> 34:32.114
Everyone here has lost something.

34:32.114 --> 34:34.908
Their money, their medical histories,
their job records. Okay?

34:34.908 --> 34:38.203
We're doing what we can,
but your data could be anywhere by now.

34:48.797 --> 34:50.047
I need to talk to him.

34:50.047 --> 34:54.219
Yo, 2753. Come on-- Come on in, man.

34:54.219 --> 34:55.929
Misty, let him in. Come on.

34:55.929 --> 34:57.139
I need your help.

34:58.390 --> 35:00.434
They're gone. Everything's gone.

35:00.434 --> 35:02.978
I warned you.
Mother Nature's mad at her children.

35:02.978 --> 35:06.607
Malware taking down firewalls faster
than Cache can put them back up.

35:06.607 --> 35:09.610
I'm hearing, like,
one in four accounts being snatched up.

35:09.610 --> 35:13.363
My account, my memories.
You gotta help me.

35:13.363 --> 35:16.658
- I don't have to do anything, actually.
- Help me.

35:16.658 --> 35:17.910
Help me.

35:18.493 --> 35:19.745
I have summer heart.

35:20.662 --> 35:22.706
Cognitive decline has already started.

35:22.706 --> 35:25.292
Summer heart. Beat, beat, beat.

35:25.292 --> 35:28.003
Well, then you're gonna lose
all your memories anyway.

35:28.003 --> 35:31.340
CO2 level's a great big eraser
for the old cortex container, innit?

35:31.340 --> 35:34.760
That shit's up to
about 560 parts per million now, innit?

35:35.677 --> 35:37.554
Live in the present, mate.

35:38.096 --> 35:40.182
It's my girl, okay?

35:40.849 --> 35:43.310
She's gone, and this is all I have of her.

35:43.310 --> 35:45.229
Fuck.

35:45.938 --> 35:48.357
You know, I would love
to forget the last girl that I had.

35:48.357 --> 35:49.441
Forget--

35:50.025 --> 35:53.529
Please! I know you can find them.

35:59.034 --> 36:00.619
I know you can find them.

36:04.831 --> 36:09.169
You willing to throw some units at it?
'Cause that shit ain't cheap.

36:11.839 --> 36:14.216
- Well.
- How much?

36:14.925 --> 36:16.718
20,000 units.

36:16.718 --> 36:18.136
I don't have it.

36:18.762 --> 36:21.473
Well, I hear there's great money
to be made in Pack,

36:21.473 --> 36:22.975
especially for a pretty boy like you.

36:22.975 --> 36:25.644
- So pretty.
- I don't do that kind of work.

36:25.644 --> 36:27.938
Well, maybe it's time
you gave it a whirl, huh?

36:27.938 --> 36:29.022
Whirl.

36:31.191 --> 36:32.484
I'll pay you half tomorrow.

36:37.322 --> 36:40.117
What sort of movies of you
and old what's-her-name do you have

36:40.117 --> 36:42.703
in that broken brain box of yours?

36:43.620 --> 36:46.874
10,000 tomorrow. I promise.

36:48.292 --> 36:51.920
It's a promise
from a boy with summer heart.

36:52.754 --> 36:55.215
What if you do forget?

36:56.675 --> 36:57.843
Look at him run away.

36:57.843 --> 37:00.304
- <i>Welcome home, Ezra.</i>

38:34.857 --> 38:37.317
I wouldn't know anything about that.

38:38.026 --> 38:41.822
What I do know is your lease is expired.

38:41.822 --> 38:43.490

She can't go outside on most days.

39:27.826 --> 39:29.745
I need this job.

39:30.537 --> 39:33.874
We're switching
to full automation next quarter.

39:34.833 --> 39:37.961
Your position no longer exists.

out of the building.

39:58.982 --> 40:03.862
Hey, it's 2753.
I'm close. I'm very close.

40:03.862 --> 40:06.073
I have one more gig,
then I'll have it for you.

40:06.073 --> 40:08.367

40:10.953 --> 40:12.412
There you are.

40:14.790 --> 40:16.083
I'm sorry, I'm late.

40:16.083 --> 40:17.751
Doesn't your watch work?

40:19.294 --> 40:20.128
Fuck.

40:23.382 --> 40:24.800
I'm sorry, I'm all out of sorts--

40:24.800 --> 40:26.176
You should leave.

40:27.427 --> 40:28.554
Don't let this ruin our night.

40:28.554 --> 40:30.722
Two years, gone just like that.

40:31.598 --> 40:34.768
In the real world,
outside of Pack, I'm dealing

40:34.768 --> 40:36.895
with a very difficult situation.

40:37.604 --> 40:39.857
I need four thousand units.

40:39.857 --> 40:41.441
Excuse me? Help you? Help you?

40:41.441 --> 40:43.151
Fuck you.

40:44.736 --> 40:46.280
I am not paying for any of this!

40:48.115 --> 40:50.993
<i>Heat wave in effect.

40:50.993 --> 40:52.619

41:38.040 --> 41:41.585
<i>to come home to you cooking dinner.
I gave you access to the apartment.</i>

41:41.585 --> 41:42.669
Accept.

41:55.974 --> 42:00.687
My teacher says it's going to be
too hot to go outside for the next week.

42:00.687 --> 42:03.941
Then we just need to come up
with fun things to do inside.

42:03.941 --> 42:06.485
You could tell me a story.

42:07.236 --> 42:10.113
Okay.
What kind of story do you wanna hear?

42:12.324 --> 42:15.494
Sorry I'm late.
The tube was flooded again.

42:17.120 --> 42:18.914
I had to walk from the office.

42:19.623 --> 42:21.083
Hello.

42:22.543 --> 42:25.003
This looks great!
Thanks for cooking, love.

42:25.671 --> 42:27.589
Daddy's telling me a story.

42:27.589 --> 42:29.216
Oh, yeah? What story is that?

42:29.216 --> 42:31.176
The one about the last whale.

42:31.176 --> 42:33.512
- I wanna hear that one too.
- Right.

42:34.721 --> 42:35.848
The last whale.

42:38.058 --> 42:39.810
I think I was about your age.

42:40.811 --> 42:41.979
It was very hot.

42:43.981 --> 42:47.693
There were warnings.

42:53.365 --> 42:54.783
I was...

42:56.660 --> 42:58.745
- Wanna see, Ezra?
- Come on.

42:58.745 --> 43:02.249
- I was-- I was on a boat.
- Where?

43:05.711 --> 43:06.962
Where?

43:09.715 --> 43:11.341
I don't remember.

43:15.095 --> 43:17.389
There was a fisherman and...

43:18.390 --> 43:20.475
- Come on.
- ...and a woman.

43:24.521 --> 43:26.899
We were in the water.

43:29.109 --> 43:30.777
Who was the woman?

43:46.710 --> 43:49.922
I'm sorry. I can't remember.

43:49.922 --> 43:52.716
Girlie, we can finish
this story another time, okay?

43:53.383 --> 43:55.469
Can you give me and Daddy a moment alone?

43:55.469 --> 43:56.970
Is something wrong?

43:56.970 --> 44:00.390
No. No. I'm fine.

44:00.891 --> 44:02.893
Come on. Let's get ready for bed, huh?

44:02.893 --> 44:04.311
- Good night, Daddy.
- Okay.

44:04.311 --> 44:06.021
Good night, my love.

44:16.615 --> 44:19.660
That story. Was that from your real life?

44:20.577 --> 44:23.580
Must be. That's why I'm forgetting it.

44:25.332 --> 44:30.295
I can still remember new things,
but the past...

44:32.005 --> 44:33.423
You were a boy.

44:35.050 --> 44:36.802
You said there was a woman with you.

44:38.011 --> 44:39.596
Your mother, maybe?

44:44.852 --> 44:46.228
Maybe.

44:48.438 --> 44:50.065
And there was a whale.

44:50.065 --> 44:52.192
Yes, you were telling us
about the last whale.

44:52.192 --> 44:55.195
The woman, I knew her.

44:59.449 --> 45:00.993
I deleted her.

45:03.120 --> 45:04.663
I deleted everything.

45:05.831 --> 45:07.374
Everything but Lola.

45:08.625 --> 45:09.668
Lola?

45:11.253 --> 45:12.421
Is that--

45:12.421 --> 45:14.715
It's happening faster than I thought.

45:17.009 --> 45:18.510
When did she...

45:21.013 --> 45:22.347
What can you remember?

45:24.141 --> 45:25.851
It's been three years.

45:28.103 --> 45:29.646
She had summer heart.

45:30.981 --> 45:32.149
So do I.

45:33.567 --> 45:35.110
I'm so sorry.

45:35.110 --> 45:37.571
They developed an experimental treatment.

45:39.615 --> 45:41.200
It worked on me...

45:44.453 --> 45:45.787
but not...

45:48.957 --> 45:50.918
And it wasn't just her heart.

45:52.920 --> 45:54.338
She was pregnant.

45:58.217 --> 46:02.095
I lost them both.
And now I'm losing her again.

46:03.305 --> 46:04.765
I'm sorry.

46:06.850 --> 46:08.477
I'm so sorry.

46:32.501 --> 46:34.044
Your lifeline...

46:36.630 --> 46:38.340
You have more than one.

46:43.262 --> 46:44.638
What does that mean?

48:18.857 --> 48:22.486
<i>2753. Good news.</i>

48:22.486 --> 48:24.696
<i>I found your memory assets, yeah.</i>

48:24.696 --> 48:27.282
<i>It was a little bit harder than I thought.</i>

48:27.282 --> 48:31.161
<i>I mean, they wound up
in a troll farm in low earth orbit,</i>

48:31.161 --> 48:35.165

<i>Please, I am desperate here.
My husband is out of control.</i>

49:47.362 --> 49:48.614
Accept.

49:53.452 --> 49:58.248
The heat, it affects his temper.
He won't do the CRISPR solve.

49:58.248 --> 50:01.627
He doesn't care much for science.
Are you listening?

50:02.794 --> 50:05.547
Yes, yes.
I'm aware your husband is a rager.

50:05.547 --> 50:07.508
It's wet bulb 34 out there.

50:07.508 --> 50:09.927
I assure you,
we're trained for these scenarios.

50:09.927 --> 50:12.221
The last time it got this hot,
he went to the pub and got--

50:12.221 --> 50:15.349
- How long have we been together?
- About a year, that he knows of.

50:15.349 --> 50:18.769
We met in Maida Vale through my sister,
but please don't mention her.

50:18.769 --> 50:20.145
Have I been here before?

50:20.145 --> 50:24.066
A few times when he was away,
but he doesn't need to know that.

50:24.066 --> 50:26.068
- I love him. I love him! I do!
- Is that him?

50:26.068 --> 50:29.196
- You don't need to--
- Is this the fucking guy?

50:30.697 --> 50:34.159
- It's done. It's done.
- She loves you.

50:34.159 --> 50:35.285
I love you.

50:35.285 --> 50:38.205
It's over between us.

50:38.205 --> 50:40.415
That's what I've said.
I wanna be with you.

50:40.999 --> 50:42.167
I'll never be the man you are.

50:42.167 --> 50:45.587
I mean, you--
you can provide for her in ways I never--

50:46.839 --> 50:49.675
Brown eyes, guess, lavender.

50:52.052 --> 50:55.514
- Lola. Brown eyes, guess, lavender...
<i>- New notification from Pack.</i>

50:55.514 --> 50:58.016
<i>Contract terminated: Natasha Alper.</i>

50:58.016 --> 51:01.019
Shit. Call Natasha Alper.

51:01.019 --> 51:04.565
<i>Natasha Alper unavailable.
Would you like to leave a message?</i>

51:06.233 --> 51:07.985
- Daddy!
- Natasha, I need to--

51:07.985 --> 51:09.820
Harlyn, go to your room.

51:09.820 --> 51:11.238
What happened to Daddy?

51:11.238 --> 51:12.698
Go to your room. Shut the door.

51:19.246 --> 51:20.747
- Get out.
- Wait--

51:20.747 --> 51:24.334
Leave now.
I don't want you in our lives anymore.

51:24.334 --> 51:26.253
- We'll find someone else.
- I can explain.

51:26.253 --> 51:28.463
I thought you didn't offer
the sensory experience.

51:28.463 --> 51:31.800
- I understand why you'd be upset.
- Do you?

51:31.800 --> 51:34.052
Well, since you're new to it,
you should know,

51:34.052 --> 51:36.972
if you're gonna charge me for sex,
you should at least fuck me like he would.

51:38.307 --> 51:41.018
But last night, that wasn't David.
We both know that.

51:41.518 --> 51:42.686
I'm sorry.

51:43.687 --> 51:44.688
I really am.

51:47.441 --> 51:51.904
But I had to. I didn't have a choice.
I needed the money.

51:51.904 --> 51:54.156
- What?
- It's Lola.

51:54.948 --> 51:57.826
- I can't lose her.
- My God, look at yourself!

51:58.410 --> 52:00.329
You're trying so hard
to hold on to the past,

52:00.329 --> 52:03.040
- you don't even exist in the present!
- What about you?

52:05.375 --> 52:08.754
You hired me to play a man
that you wish existed.

52:09.546 --> 52:12.090
The David that didn't abandon you
and your daughter.

52:12.090 --> 52:13.550
Fuck you.

52:14.551 --> 52:16.762
At least I'm not just pretending
to be someone's partner,

52:16.762 --> 52:20.807
- pretending to be a parent.
- Because all I can do is pretend!

52:23.352 --> 52:25.812
They fixed my heart, fine.

52:26.647 --> 52:29.858
But my brain, my fucking brain--

52:31.151 --> 52:34.321
I'm lost somewhere inside it.

52:39.743 --> 52:41.078
I'm lost.

52:47.835 --> 52:52.297
Brown eyes, guess, lavender...

52:52.297 --> 52:53.799
You have to let it go.

52:55.551 --> 52:56.927
Let her go.

52:58.720 --> 52:59.805
I can't.

53:01.974 --> 53:03.600
I was happy then.

53:05.143 --> 53:06.687
That I remember.

53:07.896 --> 53:09.314
Being happy.

53:09.898 --> 53:11.692
And what about now?

53:12.609 --> 53:13.694
Are you happy now?

53:15.237 --> 53:16.780
She's gone...

53:18.282 --> 53:19.908
and she's not coming back.

53:21.034 --> 53:22.369
I know--

53:23.453 --> 53:25.122
I know how that feels.

53:29.293 --> 53:32.087
But you're-- you're still here.

53:37.176 --> 53:40.137
My daughter thinks you're her father...

53:44.099 --> 53:45.601
and I don't even know your name.

53:48.187 --> 53:49.688
I don't even know your name.

54:09.374 --> 54:10.542
Ezra.

54:12.002 --> 54:13.545
My name is Ezra.

54:17.508 --> 54:18.592
And who is he?

54:24.389 --> 54:26.183
I guess you really are forgetting shit.

54:26.183 --> 54:28.060
Don't you remember we've got a deal?

54:30.062 --> 54:32.356
Do you remember
who punched you in the face?

54:33.815 --> 54:37.027
That was some pretty touching stuff
I found of her, yeah.

54:37.027 --> 54:38.529
May have even used a couple of clips

54:38.529 --> 54:41.198
to make my day go a bit fast,
if you get my meaning.

54:41.698 --> 54:44.243
Whatever happened to the baby? Hey?

54:44.243 --> 54:47.037
Was it a boy or a girl, hey?
Are you a daddy?

54:47.871 --> 54:50.749
Well, it should be no problem
finding a buyer for all of that.

54:51.250 --> 54:53.877
Look, you better pay me,
or I am selling that shit,

54:53.877 --> 54:57.714
and everyone will see her arse
on a billboard in Piccadilly Circus.

54:58.340 --> 54:59.883
What was her name, big man?

54:59.883 --> 55:01.134
You remember?

55:01.885 --> 55:02.970
Lola!

55:14.106 --> 55:17.401
<i>We've had to say goodbye again and again.</i>

55:18.902 --> 55:21.071
<i>Now it's time to say hello.</i>

55:22.906 --> 55:26.660
<i>Reintroducing one of
the most majestic creatures of our world,</i>

55:27.369 --> 55:29.454
<i>the great humpback whale.</i>

55:30.956 --> 55:35.669
<i>Coming soon to
the London Menagerie2100 beta zoo.</i>

55:35.669 --> 55:39.548
Ezra, Ezra!
Is this like the whale you saw?

55:39.548 --> 55:40.924
I never saw a whale.

55:40.924 --> 55:43.177
But you said you saw the last one.

55:43.677 --> 55:44.720
Did I?

55:45.429 --> 55:46.430
Hey.

55:46.430 --> 55:49.349
<i>Our world comes with so much uncertainty.</i>

55:49.349 --> 55:50.434
How was your day?

55:50.434 --> 55:52.436
You know, better now.

55:53.353 --> 55:55.063
- Should we go eat?
- Yeah.

55:55.063 --> 55:58.233
Come on. What do you
and Joey the dragon want to eat?

55:59.443 --> 56:01.278
- She's pretty.
- Guess.

56:02.404 --> 56:03.906
Yeah, she is.

56:03.906 --> 56:06.867
<i>Exowomb technology

56:06.867 --> 56:09.036
<i>eliminating the risk
of climate-stressed pregnancies...</i>

56:09.036 --> 56:10.120
Ezra?

56:10.120 --> 56:13.665
<i>...and premature births,
protecting both mother and baby.</i>

56:14.166 --> 56:16.168
<i>Your family deserves the best beginning.</i>

56:16.168 --> 56:17.252
Ezra, are you okay?

56:17.961 --> 56:19.254
<i>Exowomb.</i>

56:19.838 --> 56:22.466
- <i>Start planning your future today.</i>

56:23.467 --> 56:25.385
- Yeah.
- Where'd you go?

56:26.053 --> 56:28.889
Nowhere. I'm right here.
