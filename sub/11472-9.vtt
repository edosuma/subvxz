Hey, Lindsay,

00:04.805 --> 00:07.373
do you ever think
about heavy stuff?

00:07.974 --> 00:09.209

Well, yeah.

00:16.249 --> 00:18.652
When my grandmother died,
I was pretty depressed.

00:18.685 --> 00:19.853
I took it
pretty hard.

00:19.886 --> 00:22.122
Yeah, yeah.
No, yeah.

00:22.155 --> 00:24.525
I knew that you
were like me.

I can't even talk
to those other guys.

00:27.293 --> 00:30.196

they're jokers.

They don't think about
the meaning of life

00:32.833 --> 00:34.501

think about...

00:35.802 --> 00:37.538
Why we're here

00:37.571 --> 00:40.173
and they don't about
the point of it all.

I'm thinkin' about?

right now?

01:09.803 --> 01:11.605
I thought
he was dead.

01:12.973 --> 01:15.008
Yeah, he's dead,
but what I'm saying,

01:15.041 --> 01:16.577
is that, where is he?

01:16.610 --> 01:19.913
Like, is he in the ground
rotting away somewhere,

or maybe he's up
in heaven...

of breaking up

the players' lockers

for the big game.

would you be pumped?

to like me.

08:55.502 --> 08:58.338
You wanna deny
the school big laughs

08:58.371 --> 09:00.340
just so you can
hit on a girl?

09:00.373 --> 09:01.808
This is my chance.

09:01.842 --> 09:03.544
You know how important
this is to me.

09:03.577 --> 09:05.912
You know how important
this is to <i>me.</i>

09:05.946 --> 09:09.249
Being the school mascot
has always been my dream.

09:09.282 --> 09:11.184
Yeah, since lunch.

09:11.217 --> 09:12.853
Come on, NEAL.

09:14.588 --> 09:15.989
I don't know.

09:16.690 --> 09:18.458
Help me,
Obi‐Wan Kenobi.

09:18.491 --> 09:20.326
You're my only hope.

09:20.360 --> 09:23.764
You had to go and quote
the Star Wars, didn't you?

09:25.198 --> 09:26.432
All right. Sure.

09:26.466 --> 09:27.500
Yes!

09:27.534 --> 09:28.835
Thank you.

09:30.971 --> 09:34.307
In cafeteria today,
the school mascot fell
and broke his arm.

09:34.340 --> 09:35.509
It was pretty scary.

09:35.542 --> 09:36.843
Oh, poor thing.

09:36.877 --> 09:39.379
Yeah. They need
a new mascot
for the game,

09:39.412 --> 09:40.781
so I think I'm
gonna audition.

09:40.814 --> 09:42.182
Oh, that'll be fun.

09:42.215 --> 09:45.652
You know how
I love to watch
you kids perform.

09:45.686 --> 09:47.621
You're not going
to the game, are you?

09:47.654 --> 09:50.356
Of course we are.
It's a big community
event.

09:50.390 --> 09:51.592
So?

09:51.625 --> 09:52.893
So I'm expected
to be there.

09:52.926 --> 09:54.394
I'm a community
leader.

09:54.427 --> 09:55.696
Since when?

09:58.031 --> 10:00.534
It's just a dumb
basketball game, Dad.

10:00.567 --> 10:02.836
JEAN: I know why
you don't want
us to go.

10:02.869 --> 10:06.039
You have a date with
your new boyfriend,
Nick Andopolis.

10:06.072 --> 10:09.610
I mean, we're gonna
get to know him
sooner or later.

10:09.643 --> 10:11.311
Why don't we just
all go together?

10:12.112 --> 10:13.714
Mom...No.

10:13.747 --> 10:16.182
HAROLD: I'm a member
of the rotary, you know.

10:16.216 --> 10:17.684
And the Masons.

10:17.718 --> 10:19.720
And Councilman Applebee,
just last week,

10:19.753 --> 10:21.655
asked me to run
for the school board.

10:22.288 --> 10:23.624
That's great, Dad.

10:24.390 --> 10:26.059
Boy, I could be
the mayor,

10:26.092 --> 10:28.562
I wouldn't get
any respect around
this house.

10:28.595 --> 10:29.896

11:04.297 --> 11:05.666

11:15.375 --> 11:16.710
Hey.

11:17.644 --> 11:20.146
Nick...What are
you doing here?

11:21.114 --> 11:23.049
I can't stop
thinking about you.

11:25.051 --> 11:26.920
I just had to see
your face.

11:35.161 --> 11:36.162
OK.

11:37.964 --> 11:39.900
Well, I don't wanna
get you in trouble.

Good night.

11:47.440 --> 11:48.775
Bye.

11:58.985 --> 12:00.420
Hey, Sam,
I heard the mascot

12:00.453 --> 12:03.489
has to change with
the cheerleaders in
the girls' locker room.

12:03.524 --> 12:05.358
Really? That
doesn't sound right.

12:07.327 --> 12:08.494
Hey, Cindy.

12:08.529 --> 12:11.364
Hey, Sam.
Hey. Uh...

12:11.397 --> 12:12.866
Guess what?
What?

12:12.899 --> 12:15.368
I'm gonna audition
for the school mascot.

12:15.401 --> 12:17.003
Really?
Yeah.

12:17.037 --> 12:20.106
Sam, being
a mascot's a lot
harder than it looks.

12:20.140 --> 12:22.442
You have to be
super coordinated.

12:23.276 --> 12:24.811
I'm really coordinated.

12:24.845 --> 12:26.379
You'd be surprised.

12:26.412 --> 12:27.848
All right, cool.

12:27.881 --> 12:29.950
But it's not up
to me. Vicki's
head cheerleader.

12:29.983 --> 12:32.586
OK. Can you put in
a good word for me?

12:32.619 --> 12:36.623
OK. But it's not
like Vicki and I
are best friends.

12:36.657 --> 12:38.759
She's kinda bossy.

12:38.792 --> 12:40.994
I'll do what
I can, though.

12:41.027 --> 12:43.029
All right.
See you at
auditions.

12:43.063 --> 12:44.598
OK.
Bye.

12:44.631 --> 12:47.400
You think there's
a subliminal message
in there somewhere?

12:48.635 --> 12:50.103
For your sake,
I hope not.

12:55.141 --> 12:56.276
Hi, Heidi.

12:58.278 --> 12:59.279
I'm Lindsay.

13:00.547 --> 13:02.315
I'm in your
Spanish class.

13:03.917 --> 13:06.386
Um, you went out
with Nick Andopolis,
right?

13:07.387 --> 13:09.523
Don't remind me.

13:09.556 --> 13:11.592
Do you mind if
I ask what happened?

13:11.625 --> 13:13.326
What, are you dating
him or something?

13:13.359 --> 13:14.795
Sort of.

13:14.828 --> 13:16.930
You better ditch him.
He's crazy.

13:17.363 --> 13:18.331
What do you mean?

13:18.364 --> 13:20.066
Breaking up with him
was, like, a nightmare.

13:20.100 --> 13:22.235
He started stalking me.
He broke into my house.

13:22.268 --> 13:24.505
He got in this
insane fight
with my dad.

13:24.538 --> 13:25.939
Oh, God.

13:27.407 --> 13:28.408
Hey.

13:29.910 --> 13:31.845
Why were you
talking to Heidi?

13:31.878 --> 13:34.480
Because we're in
the same Spanish class.

13:36.683 --> 13:38.184
What were you guys
talking about?

13:38.752 --> 13:40.153
Spanish stuff.

13:41.988 --> 13:44.157
Well, you know,
just be careful with her

13:44.190 --> 13:48.261
because she's a liar.
She likes to screw
people over.

13:52.298 --> 13:55.368
Um...I'm gonna go
to woodworking.

13:55.401 --> 13:56.469

Yeah, but he's
not very funny.

14:12.886 --> 14:15.689
Well, at least
he's better than
the old mascot.

14:15.722 --> 14:17.991

was as funny
as a car wreck.

No. My mother's not
gonna let me sleep

into it.

19:53.359 --> 19:54.761
Bye‐bye, sweetie.

19:56.563 --> 19:59.199
Lindsay, I don't
like to lie.

19:59.232 --> 20:00.834
Mom, I know.
I'm sorry.

20:02.202 --> 20:04.671
You gonna let me know
what's going on?

20:04.705 --> 20:06.339
Mom, it's complicated.

20:06.973 --> 20:08.374
I see.

20:11.377 --> 20:13.213
I wanna break up
with Nick.

20:14.047 --> 20:16.683
You do? Why?

20:16.717 --> 20:19.986
It's just...It's going
too fast, you know?

20:20.020 --> 20:21.788
I need my space.

20:21.822 --> 20:24.725
And every time I try
to do it, Mom,
I chicken out.

20:24.758 --> 20:26.627
I'm afraid I'll
hurt his feelings.

20:26.660 --> 20:30.363
You don't keep going
steady with a boy
just to be nice.

20:30.396 --> 20:32.833
If it's not
gonna work out,

20:32.866 --> 20:35.636
you need to muster
your courage and
let him know.

20:35.669 --> 20:36.870
Yeah.

20:38.138 --> 20:39.873
Yeah?

20:39.906 --> 20:41.908
Yeah, yeah.

20:41.942 --> 20:43.877
No. I gotta go call him.

20:43.910 --> 20:45.345
I'm gonna go do it
right now.

20:48.849 --> 20:49.983
Hmm.

20:53.353 --> 20:56.823
(TELEPHONE RINGING)

21:05.832 --> 21:06.833
Hello.

21:08.068 --> 21:09.335
<i>Hello?</i>

21:10.904 --> 21:12.573
<i>Ken, if this is you,</i>

21:12.606 --> 21:14.775
you were supposed to be
here an hour ago.

21:14.808 --> 21:17.544
I don't like having
to wait around.

21:18.779 --> 21:20.046
I got other stuff to do.

21:22.649 --> 21:28.388
(DUFUS VOICE)
<i>Are you gonna answer</i>
<i>me, Keeeeeeen?</i>

21:29.389 --> 21:30.991
Hello‐‐
(HANGS UP)

21:34.427 --> 21:36.530
Hey, how'd it go?

21:37.764 --> 21:39.766
Well, I think I should
tell him in person.

21:40.333 --> 21:41.768
Don't you?

21:41.802 --> 21:45.405
Yeah. Remember,
you have to do
what's right for you.

21:45.438 --> 21:47.407
I'm just gonna
tell him tomorrow
before the game.

21:47.440 --> 21:49.876
OK. Night, sweetie.

21:49.910 --> 21:56.149
Oh, and...If there's
anything else you want
to talk over,

21:56.182 --> 21:58.084
I'm always here for you.

22:02.222 --> 22:03.824
Night, sweetie.

22:09.563 --> 22:12.265
Fine. If this isn't Ken,

22:12.298 --> 22:14.835
you better not
call back here...

22:14.868 --> 22:16.837
Or I'll find you.

22:20.240 --> 22:22.609
Hey, Harold.
HAROLD: What is it?

22:22.643 --> 22:26.212
I just had a conversation
with Lindsay about
her love life.

22:26.246 --> 22:27.548
She doesn't like
her boyfriend.

22:27.581 --> 22:29.049
She's gonna break it off.

22:29.082 --> 22:30.517
Oh, praise God.

22:30.551 --> 22:35.255
She confided in me, Harold,
and she took my advice.

22:35.288 --> 22:39.292
I feel like...
A mother. You know?

22:39.325 --> 22:40.527
Yeah.

22:41.895 --> 22:43.196
You're on my leg.

22:43.229 --> 22:44.598
Oh, oh. I'm sorry.

22:44.631 --> 22:47.033
I just‐‐
I'm so tickled!

22:52.773 --> 22:54.240
Hey, Lindsay,
you wanna drive

22:54.274 --> 22:56.142
with your father and I
to the game?

22:56.176 --> 22:59.345
Yeah. I'd like to introduce
you to the pillars
of the community,

22:59.379 --> 23:01.381
also known as my friends.

23:02.716 --> 23:04.350
Well, I have to take
care of something first,

23:04.384 --> 23:05.686
so I'll just meet
you guys there, OK?

23:05.719 --> 23:08.955
Oh, that's right.
What will you say
to him?

23:08.989 --> 23:10.490
Mom, I don't know.

23:10.524 --> 23:12.092
Why not tell him
he's a greasebucket,

23:12.125 --> 23:13.293
and you deserve better?

23:13.326 --> 23:15.295
Harold.
Dad!

23:15.328 --> 23:16.930
I'll see
you guys there.

23:16.963 --> 23:18.565
OK. Good luck,
honey.

23:23.970 --> 23:25.806
What's wrong with you?

23:25.839 --> 23:27.574
I'm sore.

23:27.608 --> 23:29.743
I had mascot practice
yesterday.

23:32.012 --> 23:33.580
Um, Dad?

23:33.614 --> 23:35.916
I think Cindy Sanders
likes me.

23:35.949 --> 23:36.950
Oh, yeah?

23:37.851 --> 23:38.852
Yeah.

23:39.820 --> 23:43.456
I got to form a human
pyramid on top of her.

23:43.489 --> 23:44.991
Well, that'll do it.

23:46.660 --> 23:49.029
No. I mean,
Nick's cool,
you know?

23:49.062 --> 23:51.898
It's just that when
he gets a girlfriend,
he just goes psycho.

23:51.932 --> 23:57.704
Maybe he just gets so horny,
his brain fries. You know?

23:57.738 --> 23:59.773
No. Dumbest thing
you can do...

23:59.806 --> 24:02.342
Let a girl know
how much that
you like her.

24:02.375 --> 24:04.077
Then they just run.

24:04.110 --> 24:06.813
Oh, is that why you're
such a bastard to me?

24:08.448 --> 24:10.483
Yeah. Well, you're
still here, aren't ya?

24:12.385 --> 24:13.720
Oh, man,
there's that car!

24:13.754 --> 24:16.690
KIM: those jocks from Lincoln
that nailed us, that's them!

24:16.723 --> 24:19.492
Go. Go. Go. Go.
Before they get away!

24:20.426 --> 24:21.828
Go. Go. Go!

What do you do
with a phony sword?

24:45.251 --> 24:48.689
A million things.
You fall on it.
You stab yourself.

You stab

Your dad let me in.

25:32.165 --> 25:34.901
Look, Nick, I don't have
much time because
I told my parents

25:34.935 --> 25:36.537
I was gonna meet them
before the game.

25:36.570 --> 25:40.674
Um, I wanna
talk to you. OK?

25:40.707 --> 25:42.509
Will you sit down
for a second, please?

25:42.543 --> 25:43.844
Please?

25:49.783 --> 25:52.252
I just‐‐I want‐‐I want
to tell you what happened

25:52.285 --> 25:54.087
with me and
Heidi Henderson.

25:54.120 --> 25:55.622
You don't have to do that.

25:55.656 --> 25:57.591
I know. I know
I don't have to,

25:57.624 --> 26:00.026
but I want to. OK?

26:03.063 --> 26:04.097
All right.

26:04.130 --> 26:08.201
I had this really
huge crush on her.

26:08.234 --> 26:10.904
And, uh, when she broke up
with her boyfriend,

26:10.937 --> 26:13.907
we went out for,
like, a week.

26:14.575 --> 26:17.744
I wrote her poems...

26:19.245 --> 26:22.215
Lots and lots of poems.

26:22.248 --> 26:25.351
It turns out that she
was just on the rebound,

26:25.385 --> 26:27.353
and she was trying to
make her boyfriend jealous,

26:27.387 --> 26:29.990
and she wasn't even really
interested in me at all.

26:31.658 --> 26:34.160
So when she got back
together with her boyfriend,

26:35.328 --> 26:39.533
she started showing him
all of my poems. Right?

26:39.566 --> 26:41.635
And then the next
thing I know,

26:41.668 --> 26:44.137
she's just showing
everybody my poems.

26:45.672 --> 26:47.941
And it was really
humiliating, you know?

26:48.709 --> 26:50.310
Yeah. That's awful.

26:50.343 --> 26:52.813
So I go over to her house
when she's not home

26:52.846 --> 26:56.049
because I want to get
those poems back, right?

26:56.082 --> 26:59.520
And her dad catches me,
and he starts yelling at me.

26:59.553 --> 27:02.523
And then the cops came.
It was‐‐

27:02.556 --> 27:04.290
The whole thing
just got blown...

27:05.491 --> 27:07.594
Totally out of proportion.

27:07.628 --> 27:13.399
But the thing is,
it just‐‐It all made me
end up feeling really...

27:15.268 --> 27:17.203
Really, really insecure...

27:18.972 --> 27:20.073
About girls.

27:21.207 --> 27:23.877
Nick, I would never show
your poems to anyone.

27:25.512 --> 27:26.980
(LAUGHS)

27:27.013 --> 27:28.749
You rule...

27:30.083 --> 27:31.718
So hard.

27:31.752 --> 27:34.087
Let's go to the game.

27:34.120 --> 27:36.322
Shelley, you have a
huge stain on your sweater.

27:36.356 --> 27:38.992
I told you guys
not to wear these
when you eat.

27:39.025 --> 27:43.229
Hey, Cindy,
you'd make a really
great head cheerleader...

27:43.797 --> 27:46.032
Much nicer than Vicki.

27:46.767 --> 27:48.735
Thanks, Sam.

27:48.769 --> 27:50.904
She's just
so rude sometimes.

27:50.937 --> 27:52.673
I mean, we're all here
to have fun, you know?

27:52.706 --> 27:54.040
Hey, Cindy.

27:54.074 --> 27:55.609
CINDY: hey, Todd,
have a great game.

27:55.642 --> 27:56.943
Thanks. Thanks.

27:56.977 --> 27:58.812
Uh, hey, I‐‐I need
to ask you something.

27:58.845 --> 28:00.313
Yeah.
Schellinger!

28:00.346 --> 28:02.683
You wanna quit
chattin' up the ladies
and get over here?

28:02.716 --> 28:05.118
Yeah. Uh, it wasn't
important anyway.

28:05.151 --> 28:06.319
Oh. Right.

28:06.352 --> 28:07.754
Good luck!

28:08.822 --> 28:10.557
Oh, my God. What do you
think he wanted?

28:10.591 --> 28:12.058
Do you think he was
gonna ask me out?

28:12.092 --> 28:14.795
I don't know.
I don't think so.

28:14.828 --> 28:17.263
Yeah, but what if
he was going to.

28:17.297 --> 28:19.600
Maybe I should talk
to him after practice.

28:19.633 --> 28:22.135
Oh, this is gonna
drive me crazy.

28:22.168 --> 28:24.738
I'm not gonna be able
to remember my cheers
or anything.

28:24.771 --> 28:28.208
Cindy, he probably has
a lot of other girlfriends.

28:28.241 --> 28:29.510
Sam, don't say that.

28:29.543 --> 28:31.978
Todd is a really
popular guy.

28:33.213 --> 28:36.016
I just don't want you
to get too hung up on him

28:36.049 --> 28:40.286
just in case, you know,
he won't go out with you
or something.

28:40.320 --> 28:42.122
I guess.
Maybe you're right.

28:44.490 --> 28:45.959
I'll talk to you later.

29:01.307 --> 29:02.743
I saw 'em. Do it.

29:02.776 --> 29:04.511
Why don't you do it?

29:04.545 --> 29:06.112
'Cause I'm a girl.

29:14.621 --> 29:16.456
Just hurry up,
man, OK?

29:21.361 --> 29:22.529
What are you doing?

29:22.563 --> 29:23.630
Uh‐‐

29:23.664 --> 29:25.098
We're giving your car
a new paint job.

29:25.131 --> 29:26.600
What are you gonna
do about it, huh?

29:26.633 --> 29:27.668
What the hell?

29:27.701 --> 29:28.902
That's what you get,
water balloon boy.

29:28.935 --> 29:30.537
KEN: Yeah, man,
thanks a lot.

29:31.972 --> 29:34.641
Yo, something‐‐something
tells me it's time to go.

29:34.675 --> 29:35.842
Yeah, Kim, let's go.

29:35.876 --> 29:38.044
These losers
are from McKinley.

29:38.078 --> 29:40.981
Look what that bitch
just did to my car.

29:41.014 --> 29:42.949
You're the bitch, man!

29:42.983 --> 29:45.285
Come on, Daniel,
kick his ass.

29:45.318 --> 29:47.053
Kick my ass?

29:51.592 --> 29:54.060
Tell my mother
that I love her.

29:55.261 --> 29:56.362
VICKI: Hey, Sam!

29:58.932 --> 30:00.166
Here's your head.

30:00.200 --> 30:03.336
Please don't break it.
It costs like $600.

30:04.805 --> 30:08.609
Jeez. It's heavy.
It's gonna be harder to
do the cheers with this on.

30:08.642 --> 30:11.812
No duh. That's why
you better stay focused.

30:11.845 --> 30:13.279
Why don't you put it on

30:13.313 --> 30:15.616
and walk around
with it for a while
to get used to it?

30:15.649 --> 30:16.950
Yeah.

30:17.718 --> 30:19.485
OK.
Oh, man.

30:22.022 --> 30:25.091
(BREATHING HEAVILY)

30:35.769 --> 30:37.370
Hey, watch it!

30:37.403 --> 30:39.039
Sorry.

30:50.283 --> 30:52.052
All right. See ya.

30:53.554 --> 30:56.557
Hey, man. Give me 5
for the big game,
all right?

31:04.330 --> 31:08.068
Oh, my God, Sam.
You are never gonna
believe what just happened.

31:10.336 --> 31:11.805
Todd asked me out.

31:11.838 --> 31:15.075
He said that he liked me,
and then I told him
that I liked him back,

31:15.108 --> 31:16.442
And then he kissed me.

31:16.476 --> 31:19.112
And then he said
that he didn't have
a girlfriend.

31:19.145 --> 31:21.214
So see? You were wrong.

31:21.815 --> 31:23.249
Todd's a jerk.

31:24.217 --> 31:25.586
What?

31:25.619 --> 31:29.189
He's a jerk.
I hate to say it,
but it's true.

31:29.222 --> 31:30.824
He's not even
nice to you.

31:30.857 --> 31:32.759
He's all cocky.

31:32.793 --> 31:33.894
Sam!

31:33.927 --> 31:35.529
It's just stupid
that you like him.

31:35.562 --> 31:38.532
I mean, just because
you're a cheerleader
and he's a jock.

31:39.032 --> 31:41.635
It's so obvious.

31:41.668 --> 31:44.170
Sam, just because you're
nervous about the big game,

31:44.204 --> 31:46.940
it doesn't mean you should
take it out on me and Todd.

31:51.311 --> 31:54.280

When I try to do it‐‐

31:58.685 --> 32:00.086
Come over here.

32:01.087 --> 32:04.090
Well, no,
I'll be right back.

32:06.527 --> 32:09.262
Like you to meet a few
very good friends of mine.

32:09.295 --> 32:11.932
This is
Councilman Appleby,

32:11.965 --> 32:14.100
Stan Miller
of Stan Miller Motors,

32:14.134 --> 32:16.102
and Sheriff MacGruder.

32:16.136 --> 32:17.871
This is my daughter Lindsay.

32:17.904 --> 32:19.205
It's a pleasure
to meet you, Lindsay.

32:19.239 --> 32:20.607
Your father has
told us all about you.

32:21.842 --> 32:23.276
Nice to meet you.

32:27.113 --> 32:28.481
Sam, what are
you doing?

32:28.515 --> 32:30.617
Get dressed. The game's
about to start.

32:30.651 --> 32:33.286
Cindy kissed
Todd Schellinger.

32:33.920 --> 32:35.488
NEAL: Sam, who cares?

32:35.522 --> 32:38.424
You're school mascot.
Now's not the time
to get all weepy.

32:38.458 --> 32:40.160
You gotta go out there
and be funny.

32:40.193 --> 32:42.428
Well, I don't feel
like being funny.

32:42.462 --> 32:46.132
You think Steve Martin
always feels like
being funny?

32:46.166 --> 32:49.035
No, but he goes out on
that stage every night

32:49.069 --> 32:51.271
with his arrow and his
banjo, and he kills.

32:51.304 --> 32:53.039
Well, I'm not
going out there.

32:57.043 --> 32:58.512
Then give me the head.

32:58.545 --> 33:02.215
Don't do it, Sam.
He's only worried
about getting laughs.

33:02.248 --> 33:04.985
Sam, hand me the head
of that Norseman.

33:07.053 --> 33:09.990
So, uh, Dale, do you think
I should be running
for school board?

33:10.023 --> 33:13.026
Definitely. We could
use a man like you.

33:13.059 --> 33:15.662
Oh, my God.
Wh‐what happened
to you guys?

33:15.696 --> 33:18.064
We got jumped by some
boneheads at Lincoln.

33:18.098 --> 33:19.332
Yeah.
Why?

33:19.365 --> 33:21.768
We trashed their car.
They had it coming.

33:21.802 --> 33:25.539
LINDSAY: Dad,
you remember Daniel
and Kim, and this is Ken.

33:25.572 --> 33:26.540
Hey.
Hey, how's‐‐

33:26.573 --> 33:27.908
No. I don't believe
I've had the pleasure‐‐

33:27.941 --> 33:30.110
Yeah. Mr. Weir.
You remember.

33:30.143 --> 33:31.845
How‐‐how's Mrs. Weir doing?

33:31.878 --> 33:35.248
Oh, well, she‐‐she's OK.
Look, uh, Lindsay,

33:35.281 --> 33:37.951
Why don't you just run along
with your friends now, OK?

33:37.984 --> 33:39.352
OK.

33:39.385 --> 33:40.486
Go, Norsemen!

33:40.521 --> 33:41.888

What are you gonna do?

33:51.598 --> 33:54.968
Oh, hey, Nick.
Hi. Lindsay's mom,
remember me?

33:55.001 --> 33:58.071
Of course. Hi. Yeah.
Mrs. Weir. Hi.

33:58.104 --> 33:59.773
Yeah. How are you
holding up, huh?

34:02.843 --> 34:03.944
OK.

34:03.977 --> 34:08.048
Yeah. I am so sorry
about everything.

34:09.082 --> 34:12.786
You know. Lindsay really
does care about you.

34:12.819 --> 34:15.055
She told me so last night.

34:15.088 --> 34:18.859
She just feels
overwhelmed right now.

34:18.892 --> 34:21.127
She needs her space,
you know?

34:23.730 --> 34:24.731
Is that what she said?

34:26.867 --> 34:29.302
Uh, didn't‐‐didn't
Lindsay talk to you?

34:29.335 --> 34:31.838
Yeah. She talked to me.

34:31.872 --> 34:33.306
Oh, good.

34:33.339 --> 34:35.008
Um, it was nice
seeing you.

34:35.041 --> 34:36.409
You‐‐you, too, Nick.

34:40.313 --> 34:41.515
Hey!

34:41.548 --> 34:45.118
Honey, didn't you talk
to Nick this morning?

34:46.419 --> 34:47.921
Why, what did you
say to him?

34:47.954 --> 34:51.858
Well, I was just
trying to be nice.

34:51.892 --> 34:53.660
And, uh...

34:53.694 --> 34:57.063
Mom, did you break up
with my boyfriend?

34:57.097 --> 35:00.000
I don't‐‐no, I just, uh‐‐
Oh, my goodness.

35:00.033 --> 35:02.703
I knew I shouldn't
have told you anything.

35:02.736 --> 35:05.739
You know, from now on,
just stay out of my life,

really funny, man.

I didn't mean
to take it out
on you and Todd.

42:39.025 --> 42:40.160
He's all right.

42:42.028 --> 42:43.530
That's OK.

42:43.564 --> 42:45.599
Look, I gotta go,
all right?

42:45.632 --> 42:47.000
OK.
Bye.

42:47.033 --> 42:48.034
Bye.

43:05.519 --> 43:07.521
Neal, that was
incredible.

43:07.554 --> 43:09.455
You're the funniest
mascot I've ever seen.

43:09.489 --> 43:10.657
Thanks, Bill.

43:10.691 --> 43:12.826
No, no, you're
a comic genius!

43:12.859 --> 43:15.461
Uh, did you see
when she hit me?
Wasn't that funny?

43:15.495 --> 43:17.564
You guys should be
on a comedy team.

43:17.598 --> 43:18.899
Ha ha ha ha.

43:18.932 --> 43:20.601
There he is.
Get him, girls!

43:20.634 --> 43:22.769
Oh, no. Here.

43:22.803 --> 43:24.538
Whoa.
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

43:24.571 --> 43:26.372
Hey, come on.
Please.

43:28.341 --> 43:29.910
Oh, God!
I'm a bleeder.
