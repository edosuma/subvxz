WEBVTT

01:06.000 --> 01:07.446
Marabou's at six o'clock.

01:07.501 --> 01:10.531
There's a week stock of
food in that basket.

01:11.002 --> 01:12.202
Keep coming.

01:12.302 --> 01:15.942
They're heading on us. Shake
your tail feathers, Gogo.

01:25.903 --> 01:27.903
Take this.

01:28.604 --> 01:30.604
Direct hit.

01:38.605 --> 01:41.495
Gogo, we just become aunties.

01:42.906 --> 01:45.906
Hang on. Get them.

01:46.407 --> 01:48.708
The eggs are getting
scrambled back here.

01:49.308 --> 01:51.708
Be gone. You brute.

01:59.709 --> 02:02.209
Hold on tight, ticketies.

02:02.210 --> 02:04.760
Serious turbulence up ahead.

02:07.011 --> 02:12.411
Don't you worry, Tini.
I'll get us to Zambezia.

02:54.918 --> 02:56.918
Kai, get back here.

03:10.880 --> 03:14.647
Not your cleanest landing.
Dad, what do you expect?

03:14.747 --> 03:16.927
You can't just shout things
at me when I'm in the zone.

03:16.928 --> 03:20.459
Is that the Twilight Zone? I didn't
know we were hunting giraffes now.

03:20.659 --> 03:23.716
Yeah well, I was just trying
to do something different.

03:23.817 --> 03:26.872
Good thing you had a helmet on.
I got nothing.

03:26.972 --> 03:29.862
Come on, time for
some real training.

03:30.864 --> 03:34.264
Hey dad, you're pretty
fast, for an old bird.

03:34.357 --> 03:36.219
Your dad still has
a few moves left.

03:36.319 --> 03:39.123
Then while you move aside
and watch the magic.

03:39.423 --> 03:43.609
You know, when you were little chick
you didn't have such a mouth.

03:43.709 --> 03:46.599
I wasn't this fast, either.

03:52.498 --> 03:54.780
Not bad for an old bird.

03:54.880 --> 03:57.685
Come on man. I'm
right behind you.

04:00.566 --> 04:04.561
Let's try for a little
high-speed ascend.

04:07.984 --> 04:09.353
Show me some upward control.

04:09.354 --> 04:09.965
Check.

04:10.065 --> 04:12.958
Keep the distance. Adjusting.

04:13.058 --> 04:15.469
Lock wings and...

04:15.470 --> 04:17.250
Diving.

04:17.350 --> 04:22.705
One crocodile, two crocodile...
Three crocodile, four crocodile...

04:23.023 --> 04:25.651
Five crocodile. Open your wings.

04:25.751 --> 04:27.751
Pull up.

04:34.913 --> 04:36.913
PULL UP.

04:49.745 --> 04:54.412
Yeah, yeah, yeah, I did. I
can't believe I did it, yeah.

04:54.512 --> 04:56.597
What was that? I
did it, I did it.

04:56.697 --> 04:59.431
You trying to get yourself killed?
Five crocodiles.

04:59.531 --> 05:02.433
Dad, that's gotta be a new record.
Did you see that?

05:02.533 --> 05:04.713
I saw a hot shot
pulling a crazy stunt.

05:04.813 --> 05:06.598
Where do you think I'm
training you for?

05:06.698 --> 05:11.118
To be the fastest lizard grabber
in all the Kathungu. I don't know.

05:13.064 --> 05:16.124
I was just trying
to make this fun.

05:18.324 --> 05:20.449
I know, Kai, but...

05:22.320 --> 05:25.040
Some day you gonna have
to look after yourself.

05:25.977 --> 05:27.868
Cause no one else will.

05:27.968 --> 05:32.326
Sure Dad, whatever you say.
How about lunch?

05:32.327 --> 05:34.908
I got your favorite,
sting bug surprise.

05:35.008 --> 05:39.683
They're going somewhere. Why
do we ever go anywhere?

05:40.131 --> 05:42.508
I've never even gone
outside the boundary.

05:42.608 --> 05:47.080
There is no reason to. We've got
everything we need to survive right here.

05:47.180 --> 05:50.580
That's what it is all about?
Just surviving?

05:50.880 --> 05:52.880
Is that a mom thought?

05:54.254 --> 05:56.448
Oh, I'm sorry Dad, I
shouldn't have said that.

05:56.548 --> 05:59.042
Why don't you go?
Check on the fence.

05:59.642 --> 06:02.474
I'm going to patrol the boundary.
Hey I'll come with you.

06:02.574 --> 06:05.039
Just check on the fence.

06:07.521 --> 06:11.911
OK, check on the fence.
Third time this week.

06:12.411 --> 06:15.174
Mighty Fortress of sticks.
Why do I say that?

06:15.374 --> 06:18.478
Mention mom, pick the fence.
Simple equation.

06:18.678 --> 06:21.228
Protecting from the critters.

06:23.482 --> 06:29.500
Mayday, mayday. Assume crash position.
Hold tight.

06:34.545 --> 06:39.820
The only thing those evil bandits
are gonna eat today is my dust.

06:39.921 --> 06:41.921
Oh, No. Gogo.

06:51.033 --> 06:54.873
I've got the body
of an old lady.

06:54.874 --> 06:57.207
You're an old lady.

06:59.009 --> 07:03.004
Hello, the egg. Right.
Sorry, of course. Here.

07:05.758 --> 07:07.758
Hello, guys.

07:15.768 --> 07:20.613
Cute, huh? You've made
a friend for life.

07:20.869 --> 07:23.382
I'm gonna have to fix that tear.

07:23.383 --> 07:25.089
Thieving Marabou.

07:25.289 --> 07:28.789
You can fix that? She made
the whole basket. Wow!

07:28.889 --> 07:32.277
Hey so, where are you from?
Are you visiting someone?

07:32.377 --> 07:34.965
It can't be me. Let
just ask to yourself...

07:35.065 --> 07:38.234
Are you, are you passing through, or...
We are on a mission.

07:38.334 --> 07:42.057
Saving these poor babies from
all the bandits out there.

07:42.157 --> 07:44.127
So where you gonna take'em now?

07:44.227 --> 07:48.809
To Zambezia. There's no safer
place in all of Africa.

07:48.810 --> 07:51.418
Zambezia? Where is that?

07:51.519 --> 07:55.377
Are you getting my savage boy? You've
never heard of the city of birds?

07:55.477 --> 07:58.942
We are much further off
course than I thought.

07:58.943 --> 08:02.556
Well my darlings, looks like
an all night flight for us.

08:02.557 --> 08:05.352
Hold up, hold up, why rush? We
never get any guest around here.

08:05.377 --> 08:07.051
You guys stay the night.

08:07.052 --> 08:10.173
What? Where's a big bird
like me gonna sleep?

08:10.373 --> 08:14.733
Don't worry about it, we'll make room.
It's not much but it's home.

08:14.833 --> 08:17.218
The ducklings could use a rest.

08:17.318 --> 08:19.778
I do have a hard time
seeing at night.

08:19.779 --> 08:22.913
Great, so that's the plan I'm Kai by the way.
Kai, the guy in the sky.

08:23.113 --> 08:27.703
Well that's how my friends
call me, if I had any friends.

08:30.990 --> 08:33.753
I do not know how long
I can keep him here.

08:33.852 --> 08:37.895
He wants to go and see the world.
Meet other birds.

08:40.993 --> 08:44.694
A free spirit, just
like his mother.

08:51.455 --> 08:53.455
I was too harsh.

08:55.912 --> 08:59.845
And all the food. I'm
talking nuts from Nigeria.

09:00.245 --> 09:04.174
Seeds from Sudan,
bananas from Burundi.

09:04.275 --> 09:06.424
Snails from Swaziland.

09:06.554 --> 09:10.209
Swaziland? Where's that?
Is that november two?

09:11.327 --> 09:15.108
Look at these two,
aren't they cute?

09:15.209 --> 09:18.120
We've got some future
Hurricanes here.

09:18.220 --> 09:20.930
Hurricanes? The Hurricanes
patrol the skies.

09:21.030 --> 09:23.665
Keeping Zambezia safe and sound.

09:23.866 --> 09:26.829
They are the top fliers
in all of Africa.

09:26.929 --> 09:30.393
Protecting eggs, saving
orphans, fighting bad guys...

09:30.493 --> 09:36.013
And all the big city? Being a
Hurricane would be so awesome.

09:36.414 --> 09:38.964
Wait, can anyone go to Zambezia?

09:39.064 --> 09:44.835
Of course, there's of every feather flapping together.
Well, almost any feather.

09:44.936 --> 09:48.429
Except those vile,
disgusting Marabou!!!

09:48.430 --> 09:52.212
Who are you guys? You
thought you could elude us?

09:52.412 --> 09:53.412
On guard.

09:53.512 --> 09:55.783
You've not getting this
babies on my watch.

09:55.883 --> 09:57.901
We only want the goodies
in that basket.

09:58.001 --> 10:02.268
Go on that in a civilized manner.
No one will get hurt. Comprendeis?

10:02.368 --> 10:06.037
Nothing is civilized about you.
You eating thrashers.

10:06.038 --> 10:08.038
You stay away from her.

10:15.102 --> 10:17.919
Dad. What are you doing here?

10:28.920 --> 10:30.425
Dad.

10:30.525 --> 10:33.500
Don't fight, I'm trying to help.

10:34.930 --> 10:40.423
My dearest brother.
Get away from me.

10:40.724 --> 10:42.637
I did what I could.

10:42.737 --> 10:47.010
You brought this on yourself.
You raptors are all the same.

10:47.110 --> 10:50.852
He was just hungry. We all have.

10:50.952 --> 10:54.437
As if we Marabous
don't suffer enough.

10:54.637 --> 10:57.464
Why us?

10:57.765 --> 11:00.781
You'll pay for this.

11:00.782 --> 11:05.788
You'll pay for this. Tendai?

11:05.889 --> 11:09.702
Tendai, is it really you?
After all these years?

11:09.837 --> 11:14.444
Kai, I told you not to bring
strangers into our home.

11:14.544 --> 11:19.496
Strangers? Come little
ones, it's time we left.

11:19.497 --> 11:22.557
Hey no way, you just got here.

11:22.623 --> 11:25.003
What was that all about?

11:26.043 --> 11:30.432
Wait, wait, wait. What?
Do you know her?

11:31.176 --> 11:33.471
And that Marabou recognized you.

11:34.606 --> 11:36.368
The fence needs repair.

11:36.468 --> 11:39.181
Dad, come on, forget the fence.
Talk to me.

11:39.281 --> 11:41.954
Did you know about
the Zambezia place?

11:42.729 --> 11:44.532
You did know.

11:44.632 --> 11:46.749
All those years and
you never told me?

11:47.149 --> 11:49.100
I have my reasons.

11:49.101 --> 11:52.335
What reason could you possibly have
for keeping me stuck out here?

11:53.035 --> 11:54.772
I'm doing what's best for you.

11:54.872 --> 11:57.718
The best for me? Look for you.
I have no friends here...

11:57.818 --> 12:00.258
Nothing to do, no life.

12:00.358 --> 12:02.446
How can this be best for me?

12:02.447 --> 12:03.446
Gogo told me that ..

12:03.447 --> 12:05.210
You should never had
let her into our home.

12:05.310 --> 12:09.936
When you stick your neck out for
other birds it only brings trouble.

12:10.036 --> 12:11.980
But on Zambezia there
are the Hurricanes.

12:12.080 --> 12:14.444
If we live there we
wouldn't have any problems.

12:14.544 --> 12:17.024
Let me tell you how
it works in Zambezia.

12:17.124 --> 12:19.992
The strong like us
protect the weak.

12:20.092 --> 12:22.557
And who suffers in the end?

12:22.571 --> 12:26.013
We do. Trust me.

12:26.114 --> 12:28.123
You don't know what
you're talking about.

12:28.223 --> 12:31.182
Yes, but. But I'll tell
you what I do know.

12:31.282 --> 12:35.623
There is more to life than you, and
your fences and your boundaries.

12:35.723 --> 12:37.981
There is a whole world
outside Khartoum.

12:38.081 --> 12:44.626
Let's just go to Zambezia. You, and me, and...
I will never go back there.

12:47.517 --> 12:53.212
Then I'm sorry. Day after day, Dad,
you teach me to look after myself.

12:53.383 --> 12:56.868
Maybe, it's time I did.

13:04.203 --> 13:06.203
You know where to find me.

13:36.908 --> 13:39.628
I'm doing what's best for you.

13:41.010 --> 13:46.873
Sorry, Dad. I had to do this.
With or without you.

13:59.174 --> 14:04.108
Greetings, greetings. What are
you doing up here all alone?

14:04.209 --> 14:06.209
I'm looking for Zambezia.

14:06.252 --> 14:09.204
Then you're headed
the right way.

14:09.205 --> 14:12.371
But you'd best join the line with
us or you'll be getting very tired.

14:12.671 --> 14:17.856
Hey, don't worry about me,
I'm used to fly solo.

14:51.591 --> 14:55.820
Are we almost there? So, what
you'll be doing in Zambezia?

14:57.303 --> 14:59.938
I was kind of thinking of
joining the Hurricanes.

15:00.355 --> 15:03.734
A country bird with big dreams.
Something like that.

15:03.834 --> 15:05.726
Hey, check this out.

15:05.826 --> 15:08.611
I'm a Hurricane.

15:16.446 --> 15:18.885
I am broken low.

15:20.388 --> 15:24.532
I am broken very, very low.

15:26.338 --> 15:30.229
You know what I like to
do when I'm down? Eat.

15:30.230 --> 15:32.957
Try these little chops here.
Only the ones with the...

15:32.958 --> 15:33.958
Why us?

15:34.158 --> 15:38.178
They have the nerve to call us, bandits.
More than get here.

15:40.918 --> 15:43.473
And now one of them...

15:44.074 --> 15:47.342
Has robbed me of
my only brother.

15:47.743 --> 15:51.298
And now... I am...

15:51.699 --> 15:53.922
Alone in the world.

15:55.410 --> 16:00.170
Not quite alone. I mean, You've
got me, your fourth cousin.

16:00.195 --> 16:03.998
Once removed, that's
something, isn't it?

16:03.999 --> 16:06.945
Death is natural. Budzo.

16:07.046 --> 16:11.163
It's just a part of
the cycle of life.

16:12.564 --> 16:14.772
The last part.

16:17.452 --> 16:21.007
I shouldn't have
been so hard on him.

16:21.029 --> 16:24.926
Where is he? He
couldn't gotten far.

16:26.722 --> 16:28.722
Budzo.

16:30.109 --> 16:33.328
I'm too tired of been
left out in the cold...

16:33.928 --> 16:38.434
Fighting for scraps, while
Zambezia gets fatter.

16:38.735 --> 16:43.359
I like scraps. You
see, sir Budzo...

16:43.860 --> 16:48.266
We are... eh, scavengers. Yes, we, we...
We scavenge.

16:48.667 --> 16:50.793
Right Cecil?

16:50.894 --> 16:54.464
But all the things we
could do together.

16:55.975 --> 16:59.862
You Marabous could
rule the roost.

16:59.962 --> 17:02.387
We're more a duo, actually.

17:02.487 --> 17:04.972
Kind of had it all worked out.
So...

17:04.973 --> 17:07.839
A trio, yes, that's better.
Yes...

17:07.839 --> 17:10.753
Strength in numbers. Synergy.

17:10.755 --> 17:14.502
Think about you have
been denied for so long.

17:14.803 --> 17:18.208
Good food, good nests.

17:18.209 --> 17:21.265
It's time to take that
empire for yourself.

17:21.464 --> 17:26.480
To rule Zambezia. And would
it be a parliamentary system?

17:26.587 --> 17:30.665
A coup d'état. I rather
like the sound of it.

17:31.066 --> 17:36.928
I'll just take my cut a
small share of the spoils.

17:37.429 --> 17:43.022
After all, how many
eggs can a lizard eat?

17:43.023 --> 17:46.511
Get all the Marabous together.

17:46.512 --> 17:49.918
You tell them. They'll
be working nights.

17:50.019 --> 17:53.849
Nights are not good for me.
Me in charge?

17:53.850 --> 17:55.850
I like to sleep.

17:56.857 --> 18:00.518
Just imagine the possibilities.

18:00.619 --> 18:06.690
The pah, the prestige...
The pudding.

18:06.891 --> 18:10.003
No? Not helping?

18:10.311 --> 18:12.311
He's gone.

18:16.551 --> 18:22.734
Well, well, well. The great Tendai.
How's ending it with this.

18:26.132 --> 18:30.784
Hey, you guys workout or what? Because.
This is so serious cardio bang.

18:30.785 --> 18:34.214
I just should said I didn't spent
chow this morning, you know.

18:34.314 --> 18:38.252
Why not drive next to the stream.
Go.

18:43.253 --> 18:45.253
This is cool.

18:45.295 --> 18:48.950
It is easier to get there, yes?
Oh, Yeah...

19:23.994 --> 19:27.822
Kai, we're here.
That big old tree?

19:28.123 --> 19:31.330
That's Zambezia.
Where is the city?

19:31.431 --> 19:34.491
Talk all you want, country bird.

20:12.671 --> 20:14.920
Hey, beak is hanging open.

20:21.021 --> 20:26.538
Newtie birds come here before the landing.
Coming through.

20:26.739 --> 20:29.374
Babies on board.
Hey, I know her.

20:30.254 --> 20:36.753
Gogo lands. All hands on deck.

20:39.822 --> 20:43.368
Crazy people. Someone
give me a cracker.

20:43.710 --> 20:46.630
Stay close OK, we're going in.

20:53.253 --> 20:58.098
The flock seagull is experiencing a
delay and will be 15 minutes late.

20:59.116 --> 21:02.187
It shall be as good to be back.
It's this way visitors.

21:02.553 --> 21:05.622
The yellow zone is for
pupils and owls only.

21:05.623 --> 21:09.878
For kids. One, two, three. One missing.
We're missing a kid.

21:10.186 --> 21:14.232
Gogo, wait. Sira, Pavi,
thanks for the ride along.

21:14.440 --> 21:19.153
Enjoy the big city. We'll see
you at the Spring celebration.

21:20.790 --> 21:22.231
Careful with my eggs Niegel.

21:23.131 --> 21:25.744
Will you watch where you're going?
This is a no fly zone.

21:26.244 --> 21:30.498
Sorry, sorry. Welcome
in Zambezia.

21:30.499 --> 21:34.494
The fame city of birds. Do you
have anything to declare?

21:35.128 --> 21:38.323
I declare this place is awesome.
Your name, sir?

21:38.423 --> 21:40.967
Kai. Ouch, what are you doing?

21:41.075 --> 21:44.369
It's just a small sample.
It's kind of proceed.

21:44.569 --> 21:47.248
Dodo, up to school
office, will you?

21:47.348 --> 21:51.628
If you need lodging, may
I suggest, Mushana's?

21:51.728 --> 21:56.244
And if you need someone to
show you around. City tours.

21:56.344 --> 21:59.104
Alright, sign me up.
One more question.

21:59.204 --> 22:02.989
You can't have another feather.
No, no, no, no.

22:02.997 --> 22:07.077
What is the length of your stay with us?
I... I don't know.

22:13.692 --> 22:18.280
I just forever. Citizen,
congratulations.

22:18.488 --> 22:20.998
Citizen? You just
pass immigration.

22:20.999 --> 22:23.644
I did it. I am a real Zambezionite.
A Zambezier.

22:23.744 --> 22:24.843
A Zambeziaan.

22:24.844 --> 22:27.734
A Zambo... I'm one of you, guys.

22:30.266 --> 22:34.187
And where would the bandit be?
Over here?

22:34.354 --> 22:37.231
Oh, good, good.

22:37.582 --> 22:41.736
Maybe the caterer should
put the food over here.

22:41.836 --> 22:45.321
Is this where the weaver
birds release the flowers?

22:45.782 --> 22:48.534
Zoe? Zoooeee?

22:48.626 --> 22:51.921
Uh. Sorry. It sounds good.
Which part?

22:52.330 --> 22:55.275
All of it. I say
we go with that.

22:55.375 --> 22:58.027
You weren't listening. Were you?

22:58.036 --> 23:00.236
The Spring celebration is the
same every year, father.

23:00.330 --> 23:03.020
You don't to sweat the details.
It would be great.

23:03.474 --> 23:06.896
Oh, It will be great because
we sweat the details.

23:07.696 --> 23:11.408
Chief Sekhuru, a new citizen.

23:12.475 --> 23:16.646
Thank you, Dodo.

23:16.813 --> 23:21.235
It's just, been a while since
we had a falcon in Zambezia.

23:21.335 --> 23:25.062
I bet he's here for the Hurricanes trials.
They're tomorrow.

23:25.063 --> 23:29.550
You thinking you going out for the squad?
Me a Hurricane?

23:29.551 --> 23:33.413
Who wanna be out there flying around?
I've got way too much to do here.

23:33.513 --> 23:36.541
We've got this all part of your plan, right?
You're probably right.

23:37.041 --> 23:40.526
Besides, I like been
under your wings.

23:40.628 --> 23:45.441
Who's taking care of whom? Sekhuru, Sekhuru,
you'll never guess what I just saw.

23:45.541 --> 23:47.452
Never in a million years.

23:47.552 --> 23:51.998
Guess, guess, I can tell you.
Okay, I'll tell you.

23:52.098 --> 23:53.098
Hello, Zoe.

23:53.198 --> 23:57.028
Don't worry, Gogo, I
was just leaving.

23:58.062 --> 24:01.899
You'll never guess.
Was the Tendai?

24:02.066 --> 24:06.304
What? How did you know? Well
because his son just arrived.

24:06.404 --> 24:10.283
How do you know so much?
You never go anywhere.

24:10.491 --> 24:13.743
Where is he? In the speck
in the middle of nowhere.

24:13.744 --> 24:19.400
Called Kathungu. With his son Kai. But, but...
Kai has followed you here, it seems.

24:19.500 --> 24:23.504
And... Tendai? Do you
think he will come too?

24:24.422 --> 24:26.991
He still angry at
than one, Sekhuru.

24:27.091 --> 24:30.578
I don't think we'll be
seeing him any time soon.

24:30.678 --> 24:34.374
And Kai may be here
looking for some answers.

24:34.474 --> 24:38.214
So, you will tell him?
No, I made a promise.

24:38.394 --> 24:41.965
But if there were any reason
for Tendai to come back...

24:42.065 --> 24:48.554
It would be to come after his son.
We'll wait and hope.

24:52.667 --> 24:54.667
Hey. Do you work here?

24:55.186 --> 24:58.980
How are you? Excuse me, sorry.
A nest for the night? Yes.

24:59.080 --> 25:00.616
You again?

25:00.617 --> 25:05.321
The number 87 is all that's left.
The double-deluxe suite.

25:05.630 --> 25:07.630
I'll take it.

25:09.008 --> 25:13.304
Ok, where is it? Double-deluxe.

25:13.513 --> 25:17.517
Here it is. The big one. Deluxe.

25:17.775 --> 25:20.862
Oh, Yeah. I can
get used to this.

25:21.270 --> 25:24.674
Oh... Hi... OK, I guess
we can divide the...

25:24.774 --> 25:26.134
You too?

25:26.234 --> 25:27.426
All of you? The bed is so...

25:27.427 --> 25:29.429
The whole family? Feathered.

25:29.438 --> 25:31.421
Great. We're all
in this together.

25:31.422 --> 25:33.172
Don't worry. Because
it's the double-deluxe.

25:33.572 --> 25:35.664
Hey look, they've put
a mint on the pillow.

25:35.665 --> 25:37.665
That's not a mint.

25:44.752 --> 25:48.481
Ezee, fly by night tours...

25:48.690 --> 25:50.775
Now, exclusively in the daytime.

25:51.342 --> 25:56.681
Nest 87. Shabelle is there
a Mr. Kai in the house?

25:57.473 --> 25:59.600
Mr. Kai is asleep.

25:59.809 --> 26:02.870
OK, my fellas, clear out. Everybody shoo.
I have work to do.

26:02.871 --> 26:04.622
Can I do a late check out?

26:05.022 --> 26:09.018
Welcome to Ezee Flight by Tours.
Now due to strictly safety code...

26:09.019 --> 26:10.836
Given exclusively
in the daytime.

26:10.837 --> 26:13.365
Can you come back later?
You ordered the tour.

26:13.865 --> 26:17.519
Yeah, but not at the crack of dawn.
Actually you did my fellow.

26:17.719 --> 26:21.204
Read the fine print.
Hi, so who's that?

26:21.747 --> 26:25.651
Man, that's me. I did it myself.
Are you jealous?

26:25.751 --> 26:27.796
Ezee is the man.
Ezee is the game.

26:28.005 --> 26:31.133
My fellow, what brings
you to Zambezia?

26:31.841 --> 26:35.391
I needed... a change
of scenery, I guess.

26:36.079 --> 26:39.917
Well, Feast your eyeballs. Cause there
is no better scenery than this.

26:40.317 --> 26:42.372
I can't remember your name.
It's Ezee.

26:42.373 --> 26:43.994
Wait, what is it? Ezee.

26:44.094 --> 26:47.092
You don't get to rub it in, I'm new here.
My name is Ezee.

26:47.192 --> 26:49.489
Are you gonna do this all day?
No. I hope not.

26:49.889 --> 26:52.236
I'm Kai from Kathungu.

26:52.445 --> 26:56.440
Never heard of it. But
you're from Zambezia now.

26:56.449 --> 27:00.444
Time to meet to town.
The Ezee way.

28:37.158 --> 28:40.394
Country Bird, you know how long
we've been working on this?

28:40.494 --> 28:43.046
Sorry, we just not
carried away, you know.

28:43.246 --> 28:46.122
Ezee was showing me the
city the Ezee way.

28:46.123 --> 28:48.210
That's all we need,
another Ezee.

28:48.211 --> 28:49.815
Hey, I'm not another
Ezee, I am Kai.

28:50.015 --> 28:52.531
Got on some slack, Zoe,
he is new in town.

28:52.532 --> 28:56.727
While you two are taking it Ezee.
The weavers and I were working.

28:56.827 --> 28:59.005
This has been fun, but...

28:59.205 --> 29:00.897
We gotta get back to the tour.

29:00.898 --> 29:03.446
Shouldn't we stay and help
the nice young lady...

29:03.746 --> 29:05.338
What's her name again?

29:05.339 --> 29:07.493
Trust me man, the
longer we stay,

29:07.494 --> 29:11.404
the more damage we don't do.
Let's go.

29:12.593 --> 29:15.238
I prefer defrayed. Dah...

29:15.246 --> 29:18.024
I mean, you have to wash the worm first.
And then she says to me...

29:18.224 --> 29:20.150
Sound not compared my voice.
And I said,

29:20.151 --> 29:22.070
I'm a mockingbird,
I can't help it.

29:22.470 --> 29:25.771
You're not a mockingbird. Well,
one third on my mother's side is.

29:26.071 --> 29:28.135
Speaking of mother...

29:29.044 --> 29:33.741
The island of milk and bunnies.
Fly away, little bird.

29:34.941 --> 29:38.895
Just move out of the way,
so I can see this...

29:39.103 --> 29:43.721
This fine, young falcon.
Who is your new friend?

29:44.467 --> 29:48.054
Shake that tail on over.
My fellow, I knew it.

29:48.154 --> 29:50.154
You brought this art to cousin.

30:13.947 --> 30:18.451
Are those the Hurricanes?
Yeah, boy the Hurricanes.

30:19.060 --> 30:23.438
The baddest birds in the sky,
I taught'em all my moves.

30:23.439 --> 30:25.692
Gogo was right. They're amazing.

30:26.392 --> 30:29.871
No, no, no, no, you're
in Zambezia now.

30:30.138 --> 30:35.893
Here we say amazeeng. Try it.
Ama... amaz... Amazeeng.

30:35.902 --> 30:38.537
There's hope for you
yet, my fellow.

30:49.557 --> 30:52.643
- Hold on, hold on.
- Always going to...

30:52.852 --> 30:56.523
- Gathering, chats.
- Nigel, that includes you.

30:57.131 --> 31:00.426
Beaks closed, ears open.

31:01.356 --> 31:05.634
Friends, wanderers, Marabou's...

31:06.031 --> 31:10.445
When there Zambezians Flocked
together, they created an inside...

31:10.845 --> 31:13.806
- Inside.
- And an outside.

31:13.815 --> 31:16.678
- Outside.
- And, if you haven't noticed...

31:16.679 --> 31:19.329
- We are on the outside.
- Here we are.

31:19.429 --> 31:23.708
In the cold, lonely, desolate, outside.
Frigid Africa.

31:24.584 --> 31:27.086
- And why?
- I don't know. It's a mystery.

31:27.586 --> 31:30.785
Because they didn't
like the look of us.

31:31.073 --> 31:33.249
And what is wrong with
what we look like?

31:33.250 --> 31:37.980
- They just want all the tree house all to themselves.
- How sporty is that?

31:38.080 --> 31:40.299
- Very sporty.
- Not very.

31:40.366 --> 31:42.475
No, terrible. Not
very in my book.

31:42.476 --> 31:46.807
Which is precisely why we should
accept Budzo's proposition.

31:47.007 --> 31:50.201
Since when a Marabou's servant to a lizard.
He's got a point.

31:51.201 --> 31:56.749
We'll be working with Budzo, thick-head.
Not for him.

31:56.957 --> 31:59.851
We are partners in
this great endeavor.

31:59.852 --> 32:00.851
Yes, teamwork.

32:00.852 --> 32:03.447
We help Budzo get on the
island, we share...

32:03.547 --> 32:07.601
Lovely goodies.

32:08.218 --> 32:11.788
Yes, I'm getting hungry
just thinking about it.

32:11.805 --> 32:16.769
Question. Could there
Hurricanes be a problem?

32:16.977 --> 32:19.672
Hurricanes? Ja...
Don't make him laugh.

32:19.772 --> 32:23.901
Budzo possesses unrivaled
brute strength.

32:24.109 --> 32:25.678
So with his help.

32:25.778 --> 32:30.324
A new wind will blow
across this valley.

32:30.491 --> 32:33.118
A wind of change.

32:34.954 --> 32:37.581
Good shot. Give us another.

32:40.250 --> 32:42.250
Take it.

32:45.255 --> 32:49.843
- Fellows, fellows, fellows.
- Useless.

32:56.910 --> 33:01.830
Is that door regulation size?
I swear it getting smaller.

33:04.017 --> 33:07.037
Hurricanes ready. So how do
you get to be a Hurricane?

33:07.237 --> 33:09.639
Man, Haven't you seen all those posters?
They're everywhere.

33:10.339 --> 33:12.339
What posters? These.

33:14.110 --> 33:19.240
Man, I was supposed to put'em up.
Hurricane trials are to... today?

33:20.249 --> 33:23.798
Where? It's on the..
southwest platform...

33:23.826 --> 33:26.160
Man, just take a poster.
You'll make it if you hurry...

33:26.560 --> 33:28.441
Tell'em Ezee sent you.

33:28.541 --> 33:30.502
You know what, don't even
tell them you know me.

33:30.503 --> 33:32.295
You may not mention
my name at all.

33:32.395 --> 33:34.697
Just forget about it. Oh, nuts.

33:34.698 --> 33:38.834
And that rookies, is the race course.
Know it well.

33:38.901 --> 33:41.921
I told you he wouldn't come.
He's too busy to taking it ezee.

33:42.221 --> 33:45.357
Racers ready. Not
that busy apparently.

33:47.184 --> 33:49.937
Civilian, this is
restricted area.

33:50.404 --> 33:52.949
Hurricanes and new
recruits only.

33:52.950 --> 33:57.753
But that's why I'm here, to try out. Look, my name is Kai.
I don't have your name on my list.

33:57.953 --> 34:01.127
Can you just put it on there?
No, no, no, no, I'm sorry.

34:01.227 --> 34:06.880
The rules state that there can be no
new entries, after the appointed...

34:07.480 --> 34:12.259
Look at that, just in time. Lucky
for you, I like punctuality.

34:12.260 --> 34:13.601
Get in line.

34:14.001 --> 34:17.464
You have to make all the way
through the course and back.

34:17.465 --> 34:21.786
Failure to do so results in, failure.
On your marks.

34:22.094 --> 34:25.223
On your mark. Get set, proceed.

34:28.167 --> 34:31.087
And there they go.

34:38.803 --> 34:43.818
And with a hard break to the first gate
they move to the first straight way.

34:48.896 --> 34:51.924
Gondo, streaks ahead the pack.

34:55.569 --> 35:01.191
Coming up next, is my personal
favorite, the brand new Chicane.

35:09.108 --> 35:11.108
Excuse me.

35:11.110 --> 35:14.000
Gondo still in the lead.

35:31.964 --> 35:36.677
And now, here comes the
intermisive tornado tunnel trial.

36:18.386 --> 36:20.596
That's my fellow.

36:23.432 --> 36:25.432
Come on, Kai.

36:32.149 --> 36:35.039
They're going into
the vertical ramp.

36:58.576 --> 37:01.787
The first one is, Kai.

37:02.554 --> 37:07.824
The little falcon. I can not believe it.
Where did he come from?

37:07.849 --> 37:08.849
Yes.

37:09.237 --> 37:12.932
You've made the cap rookie.
Your movements are unorthodox.

37:13.232 --> 37:18.028
You improvise, you think outside
the box, I don't like that.

37:18.337 --> 37:22.241
But you can be proud to be a Hurricane.
Trainee.

37:22.741 --> 37:27.926
Trainee? I'm not a Hurricane?
Now, that's the spirit.

37:28.030 --> 37:30.182
It's gonna take a lot more
than one little race...

37:30.183 --> 37:32.189
To become a fully
fledged member...

37:32.190 --> 37:36.238
Of the most elite flying
force in the world.

37:38.882 --> 37:44.596
Well done, Kai. We have great
hopes for you, young falcon.

37:45.055 --> 37:46.581
I will not let you down, sir.

37:46.582 --> 37:50.752
Me? No, Kai. Don't
let Zambezia down.

37:51.353 --> 37:56.809
Zambezia always comes first.
Always remember that.

37:56.917 --> 38:02.615
I've got my eye on you, hot rod.
We go on Marabou patrol at dawn.

38:03.115 --> 38:08.870
You better get some sleep.
Trainees sleep... down there.

38:11.682 --> 38:13.682
Come on. Get up.

38:18.130 --> 38:22.718
Budzo. Comfortable, old friend?

38:23.393 --> 38:28.023
It's nice to see
a familiar face.

38:28.599 --> 38:33.930
You know, to be honest, you
look a little stressed.

38:34.896 --> 38:37.007
I left Zambezia long ago.

38:37.107 --> 38:41.137
I just want to get
my son and go home.

38:41.237 --> 38:43.872
I'm no threat to you.

38:44.114 --> 38:48.303
There's still some
fight left in you.

38:48.338 --> 38:51.738
I can see it, even
if you can not.

38:51.913 --> 38:55.442
Which is good, you'll need it.

38:55.542 --> 38:58.378
You're about to be of great use.

39:00.256 --> 39:03.900
We've got a report of
Marabou's activity upriver.

39:03.901 --> 39:08.306
We will be patrolling sector six over
here and sector seven over there.

39:09.306 --> 39:12.768
Apparently there's a
large swamp over here.

39:12.776 --> 39:14.056
No that's a stain.

39:14.156 --> 39:17.214
Who've got a stain on my map?

39:17.314 --> 39:21.719
We will our eyes focused
and our ears peeled.

39:21.828 --> 39:25.074
No, I mean, eyes
peeled and our ears...

39:26.374 --> 39:28.669
Where they should be?

39:28.909 --> 39:30.909
Give up.

39:32.054 --> 39:34.519
Stay sharp, Hurricanes.

39:40.589 --> 39:45.544
Can we be of assistance, madam? My Neville,
my Neville is floating down the river.

39:45.675 --> 39:48.546
Oh, no, no. I'd advise against
that dangerous currents.

39:48.946 --> 39:50.831
Why I can't catch up to him.
I am obliged...

39:50.931 --> 39:52.892
By city codes of Zambezia...

39:52.893 --> 39:55.769
To ask permission before
rescuing a minor.

39:55.969 --> 39:59.515
What? He is not a minor,
he is my husband.

39:59.523 --> 40:02.776
Hurricanes, rescue mission.

40:03.485 --> 40:06.800
Rookie, rookie. That's
not the right direction.

40:13.295 --> 40:17.120
One crocodile, two crocodile,
three crocodile...

40:20.002 --> 40:25.132
Six crocodile, seven crocodile,
eight crocodile... got you.

40:29.578 --> 40:33.989
Thank heavens. If you ever
do that to me again...

40:33.990 --> 40:35.092
Hug me. Snogly.

40:35.892 --> 40:37.892
Good news, hah?

40:38.963 --> 40:43.116
He drop down the blue like a rock.
The rookie is got skills.

40:43.117 --> 40:45.667
You gotta teach me that move.

40:46.070 --> 40:48.070
Attention.

40:49.874 --> 40:53.335
Just keeping your voice on your throat.
Coming through, coming through.

40:54.136 --> 40:58.258
Hey, my fellow. This is my boy.
The star of the sky, right here.

40:58.458 --> 41:02.119
Take out high, beak squeak. Hey,
where's old captain, stick in the mud?

41:02.127 --> 41:05.656
Do you have a license for this party?
The music isn't regulation.

41:06.256 --> 41:09.911
And the fun zone is located
behind the yellow line.

41:10.594 --> 41:14.931
Ezikiel, what are
you doing here?

41:15.007 --> 41:20.220
I'm with him, sir. Really?
Rookie, is this your... friend?

41:20.729 --> 41:25.025
Evacuation Procedures.

41:25.233 --> 41:28.428
Come on, my fellows.
Don't look me like this?

41:28.528 --> 41:32.699
Ezee comes, Ezee goes.

41:35.160 --> 41:40.528
Birds of a feather from every nation,
flock together for spring celebration...

41:41.363 --> 41:44.127
Rhymes.

41:45.162 --> 41:50.295
Come on everyone, this is
a mixer to get... mixed.

41:50.965 --> 41:54.620
Don't be shy, we are all friends.
That's it.

41:54.988 --> 41:57.850
Together Please, we have
limited space here.

41:58.350 --> 42:01.155
Always making a big
entrance, huh?

42:01.194 --> 42:04.789
I'm sorry about the other day, I'm
more use to open spaces, you know.

42:04.790 --> 42:09.245
Oh, then you are at the wrong party.
Where's your wing man?

42:09.753 --> 42:11.793
It's a long story.

42:12.239 --> 42:16.910
Hurricane for one day and
he saved a love bird.

42:16.919 --> 42:20.089
Is that so? No. I'm
only a trainee.

42:20.997 --> 42:25.109
Hey, Gogo, I've go to ask you.
How do you know my father?

42:25.110 --> 42:27.721
Long story. Gogo, tell me.

42:27.921 --> 42:31.476
Shush now. Listen to Sekhuru. I
would like to welcome you...

42:32.176 --> 42:36.388
All of you, to this year's
Spring celebration.

42:37.055 --> 42:42.269
Together we celebrate the
future generations of Zambezia.

42:43.311 --> 42:47.274
Grab'em troops. We
nee every Weaver.

42:49.359 --> 42:52.913
Gotcha. Away Fellows,
have what we need.

42:52.996 --> 42:56.583
Weavers, release the flowers.

42:59.745 --> 43:04.845
That's not right. The
Weavers never miss a queue.

43:07.419 --> 43:09.629
Ma... Marabou's.

43:12.173 --> 43:14.175
Tini.

43:14.484 --> 43:16.601
Gogo, save the babies.

43:16.602 --> 43:20.169
Don't panic, the
Hurricanes will get them.

43:20.304 --> 43:23.760
Tini, Tini. Zoe.

43:23.768 --> 43:26.778
Hold formation.
They're getting away.

43:26.813 --> 43:28.813
Talihou. No.

43:30.440 --> 43:31.840
A Hurricane now.

43:32.009 --> 43:36.723
Come any closer and I drop...
Oh, hold on.

43:38.408 --> 43:40.408
What are you doing?

43:47.083 --> 43:50.712
Tini, no. Tini.

43:50.787 --> 43:54.442
I will pluck every
last feather of them.

43:56.676 --> 43:58.676
Come on.

44:01.657 --> 44:05.185
You have some nerves. Why'd
you want us, anyway.

44:05.685 --> 44:08.605
We'll never going to... Tendai?

44:08.672 --> 44:10.706
Tini? Do you know who that is?

44:10.707 --> 44:12.150
You guys are dumber
than I thought.

44:12.276 --> 44:14.761
Well, what a beak on that
one, wouldn't you say, Cecil?

44:15.236 --> 44:20.081
Gibber-gabbar. She keeps on talking
never shuts up. On and on she goes.

44:20.784 --> 44:23.353
Always have to have
the last words.

44:23.453 --> 44:26.039
Well, well, well.

44:26.047 --> 44:31.118
Cecil, I must be honest, I never thought
you would actually pull this off.

44:31.119 --> 44:35.999
Quite, sir. What's next?
What else?

44:36.108 --> 44:38.322
How about we get these Weavers
to weave us some jackets?

44:38.622 --> 44:43.189
Now, they weave Budzo a bridge.

44:43.424 --> 44:48.061
For you? Never. Hey Cecil,
these Weavers are revolting.

44:48.770 --> 44:51.745
You get it? A double meaning.

44:51.790 --> 44:55.635
Insubordinate thieves. Their
kind will never change.

44:55.735 --> 44:58.429
- My friendest little Tini.
- They started this.

44:58.430 --> 45:01.548
So now we are gonna finish it.
They're still angry...

45:01.748 --> 45:04.469
about been excluded of the
founding of our city.

45:04.569 --> 45:09.983
So many years ago. I never thought
that they would structure this.

45:10.083 --> 45:12.877
What an interesting situation.

45:13.286 --> 45:16.540
You... need a little motivation.

45:16.648 --> 45:19.735
And I'm getting hungry. No.

45:20.343 --> 45:22.661
No, wait. Don't
listen to him, Tini.

45:22.662 --> 45:25.232
Leave him. We will do it.

45:25.332 --> 45:27.317
Make sure that bridge
is strong enough...

45:27.517 --> 45:31.438
To get me on that island.

45:33.612 --> 45:38.457
Time for your just desserts.
Hold on, he gets dessert?

45:38.460 --> 45:40.788
I'll go with some puddin myself.

45:40.789 --> 45:44.292
Smooth chocolate one,
with a little cherry...

45:44.701 --> 45:48.480
Our first priority is to the
get the Weavers back unharmed.

45:48.580 --> 45:53.251
I'm angry too. But our actions
can not be guided by blind rage.

45:54.469 --> 45:58.832
- What would you have me do, Sekhuru?
- The Marabou are uncamped, yes.

45:59.132 --> 46:04.537
Rude, of course, but we've never know
them to be capable of such devious acts.

46:04.637 --> 46:09.307
Maybe there's a bigger plan here. A
reconnaissance mission. Affirmative.

46:09.407 --> 46:13.012
Hurricanes, ready. No,
no, not you, hot rod.

46:13.663 --> 46:15.039
You need every bird you can...

46:15.040 --> 46:17.985
Your antics out there almost got
a basket of Weavers killed.

46:18.285 --> 46:20.665
So you are grounded, mr.

46:21.070 --> 46:24.765
Let's see if you can
handle clean up duty.

46:24.766 --> 46:28.421
Featherweight.
- Hit the road behind. What's he trying to prove.

46:29.154 --> 46:32.223
It really is such a tragedy.
Tragedy? Tell me about it.

46:32.224 --> 46:35.506
Yeah, It's not safe, at all.
- Hi Let's go with yellow today.

46:36.006 --> 46:37.111
Yellow? Thanks.

46:37.112 --> 46:41.516
It's like I told my Larry, thou.
I mean those Marabou's, filthy.

46:41.716 --> 46:44.785
And also you can't trust them.
No, my cousin she married one.

46:44.786 --> 46:45.561
No?

46:45.571 --> 46:48.971
He flew off her next day.
I'm not surprised.

46:55.497 --> 46:58.299
How about a little help?
What do you say?

47:00.961 --> 47:04.531
- Hey.
- That's what you call help where you come from?

47:05.782 --> 47:09.877
I am a night hawk. I've
got 20-20 hawk vision.

47:10.604 --> 47:13.409
Blob in the night.
It was a mess.

47:14.141 --> 47:17.144
Hi Ezee. What is up, my fellows?

47:17.752 --> 47:21.823
It's, wassup and my fella.
Sorry, my fella.

47:21.923 --> 47:27.178
I'd stood up for you. I
don't, you seemed confused.

47:28.680 --> 47:32.000
Did you know Hurricanes get free food?
Even trainees?

47:32.100 --> 47:33.375
How about a snack?

47:33.376 --> 47:35.936
You think you can
give sticky moth...

47:35.937 --> 47:37.848
And I'll just welcome you
back with open arms?

47:38.248 --> 47:40.248
How about two?

47:42.018 --> 47:46.048
Welcome back, man. I knew you were my
fella I thought you were gone forever.

47:47.156 --> 47:50.881
I knew you wouldn't let me down.

47:50.969 --> 47:56.166
That's it Ezee. But what did you
say about loving night tours?

47:56.666 --> 47:58.675
I can't believe how you
drag me out here, man...

47:58.676 --> 48:00.586
I am allergic to danger.

48:00.587 --> 48:02.846
We're supposed to just
take a peek right?

48:02.847 --> 48:05.150
Man, this better make
me a jakozi magnet.

48:06.050 --> 48:08.887
Zoe. It's working already.

48:09.696 --> 48:12.838
Kai, you're grounded. You
shouldn't be out here.

48:13.338 --> 48:15.084
Besides, you're gonna
get killed tomorrow.

48:15.184 --> 48:19.039
Fella, I think she likes you.
No.

48:19.206 --> 48:22.067
No, I get it, some wants
to be a Hurricane.

48:22.167 --> 48:26.279
- I just come out here flying a lot.
- Because you want to be a Hurricane.

48:26.579 --> 48:29.524
- That's never gonna happen.
- Well, you are on a mission now.

48:29.824 --> 48:34.812
Come on, with Ezee's night vision
We're gonna find the Weavers.

48:34.912 --> 48:37.165
Do you hear that?

48:37.373 --> 48:41.878
Of course I heard him, I
have night hearing, too.

48:42.070 --> 48:44.873
Do you see anything?
No, nothing.

48:44.881 --> 48:48.546
Just a part of trees, rocks
and a gang of Marabous.

48:50.028 --> 48:52.028
Marabous.

48:53.765 --> 48:56.668
Still, you know
undercover means?

48:56.768 --> 48:58.941
I said be home one
of the covers.

48:59.041 --> 49:00.404
I can't hear what
they're saying.

49:00.405 --> 49:03.457
That's because we're
way back here safe.

49:03.458 --> 49:05.846
Don't go up there... He goes.

49:06.017 --> 49:08.017
High up to?

49:13.943 --> 49:16.068
This is not a little peek.

49:16.096 --> 49:17.997
Kai, we need back up.

49:17.998 --> 49:19.292
Put your back into it, chaps.

49:19.392 --> 49:22.151
Weavers need a lot more grass.

49:22.152 --> 49:25.055
Did you heard Cecil?
Tini is alive.

49:25.755 --> 49:29.435
Yes, I looking at you, Nigel.
You're eating our bridge.

49:29.626 --> 49:31.753
Cecil. Hello.

49:32.261 --> 49:36.808
The boys and I, we're all
good, but one little concern.

49:36.983 --> 49:41.345
The Big lizard can we trust him?
He is cold blooded and all.

49:41.346 --> 49:44.100
I mean, it's not good for the circulation.
You're whining.

49:44.200 --> 49:47.836
- To the brain.
- Look, I've come too far to turn back now.

49:48.144 --> 49:50.754
Fair enough. No,
just a suggestion.

49:50.755 --> 49:53.105
It's an overwhelming feeling
of threat, that's all.

49:53.405 --> 49:55.026
File that away.

49:55.027 --> 49:58.163
We should call the Hurricanes.
After this, I'll be one.

49:58.663 --> 50:03.423
I'm gonna stay here as backup,
because my knees are locked.

50:03.661 --> 50:06.906
Who is that? Stop playing games.

50:08.006 --> 50:10.006
My Fella?

50:11.634 --> 50:15.402
Ezee, Ezee, are you OK?
Come on, Ezee.

50:15.672 --> 50:18.425
You got to stay with us, buddy.
Ezee.

50:18.617 --> 50:23.580
Tell my mama I love her. We
gotta get him out of here.

50:23.880 --> 50:27.705
What does this guy eat?
What doesn't he eat?

50:28.651 --> 50:31.237
I'll go get help. You stay here.

51:11.277 --> 51:13.277
Tini?

51:14.655 --> 51:18.376
Listen. First chance you get flight out of here.
Don't worry about me.

51:18.476 --> 51:21.910
What kind of talk is that? That's not
how we do thinks where I come from...

51:21.911 --> 51:24.548
Where you come from.

51:24.549 --> 51:26.763
We'll figure out
a way to escape.

51:26.863 --> 51:27.854
All of us.

51:29.754 --> 51:33.091
Let's not make the beast angry.

51:33.099 --> 51:38.369
Less talking, more weaving. Do you want
to see your friend on a dinner plate?

51:38.663 --> 51:43.193
You and you, I have a job for you.
Come with me.

51:43.593 --> 51:46.475
If it's all the same to
you, I work for Cecil...

51:46.875 --> 51:49.256
And I'd like to hear
what Cecil has to say.

51:49.257 --> 51:51.635
I'm good. There it is.
Off we go.

51:52.135 --> 51:56.147
If Budzo on that island
nothing can stop him.

51:56.247 --> 52:01.361
We'll find a way. Kai and the rest of the
Hurricanes are out there right now, looking for us.

52:01.661 --> 52:05.123
My son... A Hurricane?

52:05.189 --> 52:08.868
You will never be a Hurricane. If you
listen to what we have found out.

52:08.869 --> 52:09.868
The Weavers are...

52:09.869 --> 52:12.819
You broke so many codes
of conduct Last night...

52:12.919 --> 52:15.516
That I don't have
form long enough.

52:15.517 --> 52:16.716
You have to make something...

52:16.717 --> 52:20.361
Since you clearly have no
concept of what a team is...

52:20.461 --> 52:23.891
You can not be part of ours.

52:32.867 --> 52:37.457
This is a bad idea.
As a deeply bad.

52:44.036 --> 52:47.456
Marabous. Marabou's invasion.

52:51.669 --> 52:53.963
Hurricanes.

53:12.023 --> 53:18.058
The next time someone says
'stop' it might be a warning.

53:18.571 --> 53:22.650
This intensive care is intense.
I see someone feel better.

53:22.750 --> 53:28.706
Another cramp. Hi my fella.
That's nice. Such pain.

53:29.207 --> 53:33.372
I think he's gonna be an
injured in a regular basis.

53:33.977 --> 53:37.490
I'm sorry about the Hurricanes, I
know how much it meant to you.

53:37.590 --> 53:39.840
Yes, I'm so used
to fly in solo...

53:39.841 --> 53:41.210
I have hurt the team.

53:41.410 --> 53:44.205
We're in this together.
I'm in trouble too.

53:44.305 --> 53:48.952
Yes, but I've just got kicked off the Hurricanes.
You wouldn't even know how that feels.

53:49.252 --> 53:53.573
You're right. I guess I wouldn't.
Sorry I slow you down last night.

53:53.673 --> 53:56.618
Nobody asked you to come.
You're welcome.

53:57.318 --> 54:02.139
- I can't believe how sensitive everyone is.
- Maybe "everyone" isn't the problem.

54:02.140 --> 54:05.965
Wait, my fella just don't
leave me, Wait I'm feverish.

54:06.244 --> 54:08.663
Excuse me, which one of
both ordered a massage?

54:08.763 --> 54:14.152
- How many jobs do you have?
- Well, I don't like to be pigeonholed.

54:14.252 --> 54:18.552
There you are. Come, Kai. I'm
Sorry Gogo, I'm leaving.

54:19.465 --> 54:23.360
What? You cannot leave now, Tini needs you.
Zambezia needs you.

54:23.361 --> 54:25.887
Zambezia and me don't mix, Gogo.

54:25.888 --> 54:29.467
My Dad was right, I
never belonged here.

54:29.767 --> 54:32.895
I do not have time
for this nonsense.

54:33.104 --> 54:36.232
Let me go you lunatic stork.

54:36.508 --> 54:41.693
Don't lose them, Hurricanes.
Don't let them lose us.

54:56.969 --> 55:00.072
It's a trap. Too late to warn.

55:00.172 --> 55:05.386
Nice moves, old chap.
Yes, call it good show.

55:05.594 --> 55:08.994
Gogo, let me go, Gogo. I should
never should have come here.

55:09.094 --> 55:11.094
My dad would...

55:11.150 --> 55:15.602
Sekhuru, no more secrets.
Tell the child the story.

55:15.702 --> 55:18.716
Or do you want history
to repeat itself?

55:18.816 --> 55:23.279
Yes, perhaps it's time.
Time for what?

55:23.487 --> 55:29.410
That you to learn the truth. This
is where you started out of course.

55:29.785 --> 55:34.123
Wait, I was born in Zambezia?

55:36.417 --> 55:40.880
Welcome home, Kai. Come inside.

55:54.018 --> 55:56.018
What is this?

55:57.456 --> 56:01.126
Dad? And?

56:02.193 --> 56:04.193
My mother.

56:04.403 --> 56:07.531
Amai. They lived here?

56:07.740 --> 56:12.003
They founded the Hurricanes together.
To guard Zambezia...

56:12.103 --> 56:16.691
And to offer protection to all
birds in the river valley.

56:16.791 --> 56:19.086
What happened to her?

56:19.377 --> 56:22.171
Murderer, she was my wife.

56:23.089 --> 56:26.784
You're not still upset about
that one little thing...

56:26.884 --> 56:29.604
That happened that one time.

56:33.641 --> 56:36.352
It's just what I do.

56:37.103 --> 56:40.381
You could say: It is my nature.

56:40.481 --> 56:43.359
When nature calls, I answer.

56:44.528 --> 56:49.390
Step it up, Weavers. We are
going to make this valley...

56:50.157 --> 56:53.411
into one big egg omelet.

56:54.120 --> 56:58.749
- You Monster.
- Thank you. One does what one can.

57:01.937 --> 57:06.008
We came across a nest under
attack, by an iguana named Budzo.

57:06.374 --> 57:08.800
Your mother fought so bravely.

57:08.801 --> 57:14.473
I may have lost a wing,
but she gave her life.

57:14.849 --> 57:18.561
We managed to save
one egg that day.

57:18.769 --> 57:23.882
And that was me. If it wasn't
for her, I wouldn't be here.

57:23.883 --> 57:24.883
Zoe?

57:26.853 --> 57:30.231
Now I understand why your
are so interest in Kai.

57:30.439 --> 57:35.470
That was only a part of it. I
know good talent when I see it.

57:35.870 --> 57:38.939
But, Why didn't my dad
tell any of this?

57:39.039 --> 57:41.400
And why are you only
telling me now?

57:41.500 --> 57:44.278
Your father was
blinded by grief.

57:44.378 --> 57:48.457
He made me promise, to
bury the past forever.

57:48.557 --> 57:53.187
So, he took me to Kathungu.
Away from everything.

57:53.196 --> 57:56.895
Tendai could no longer see
the value of Zambezia.

57:57.295 --> 57:59.234
Only the cost.

57:59.235 --> 58:02.263
When you stick your neck out...
Good things happen.

58:02.363 --> 58:06.443
There, Gogo. So,
history lesson over?

58:07.860 --> 58:10.697
I saw Budzo. What, Budzo?

58:11.063 --> 58:13.091
Where? Last night in the forest.

58:13.291 --> 58:16.652
That lizard was missing a claw. That's
what the Marabous where talking about.

58:16.952 --> 58:20.573
They must be working with Budzo. I
don't know what they're up to...

58:20.673 --> 58:25.778
But if Marabou's are helping Budzo
we could be in great danger.

58:25.878 --> 58:29.256
That brute better not lay
a single claw on my Tini.

58:29.257 --> 58:30.708
We have to go back
to that forest.

58:30.709 --> 58:32.368
The Marabou could
have flown anywhere.

58:32.468 --> 58:34.634
But Budzo must
have left a trail.

58:34.734 --> 58:36.538
And that can lead
us to the Weavers.

58:36.539 --> 58:40.451
No, it's too dangerous. You don't
know what you're flying into.

58:40.651 --> 58:42.678
We should wait for
the Hurricanes.

58:42.978 --> 58:45.690
It could be too late by then.
They all should be back by now.

58:45.790 --> 58:47.241
We need to go, father.

58:47.341 --> 58:49.735
I know it's risky, but what
choice do we have, sir?

58:49.835 --> 58:54.425
It's just like you say,
Zambezia comes first.

58:54.823 --> 58:58.269
You always wanted to be
up there, haven't you?

58:58.369 --> 59:01.599
I'm ready, Father.
I'll find them.

59:02.231 --> 59:05.793
Go. You think I'm crazy now...

59:06.001 --> 59:08.963
You have not seen crazy.

59:30.843 --> 59:33.112
Don't make a sound.

59:34.689 --> 59:39.510
Are you serious? What was that?
What? I've got old bones.

59:40.077 --> 59:43.938
Hey, check that out.
Lizard toe minus one claw.

59:43.939 --> 59:48.803
Soon he will be missing a few more claws.
Alright, alright, a little down on that.

59:49.003 --> 59:54.008
Don't worry little Tini, mama Gogo
is gonna save you little Tini.

59:54.216 --> 59:57.161
- My little Tini.
- You know what.

59:57.162 --> 01:00:00.262
- Maybe I should check it out first.
- Good idea.

01:00:11.543 --> 01:00:16.122
Just stay focus, I think.
We are celebrating already.

01:00:16.322 --> 01:00:18.180
Where do you think
it comes from?

01:00:18.280 --> 01:00:20.643
Without us it would
just be an empty tree.

01:00:20.743 --> 01:00:23.687
- She's got a point.
- Well, off course she's got a point.

01:00:23.787 --> 01:00:26.715
- Kai?
- Tini? What is going on?

01:00:26.716 --> 01:00:30.010
It's Budzo. He made us to build a
bridge to get him on Zambezia.

01:00:30.210 --> 01:00:33.714
- Kai, they left ages ago.
- We have to get there before they do.

01:00:33.814 --> 01:00:36.575
- What about your dad?
- What about him?

01:00:36.675 --> 01:00:38.076
- He's here.
- What?

01:00:38.077 --> 01:00:41.243
You know, to be a Zambeziaan
I would even take a bath.

01:00:41.244 --> 01:00:43.541
There, I said it.

01:00:43.641 --> 01:00:47.293
Yeah. Of course they gonna trust us.
I barely trust myself.

01:00:47.294 --> 01:00:48.294
Dad.

01:00:48.921 --> 01:00:50.320
Did you hear that?

01:00:50.321 --> 01:00:53.333
I can hear noise, is
yes that was a noise.

01:00:53.334 --> 01:00:57.405
Go have a look. Why do I
always have to have the look?

01:00:57.905 --> 01:01:00.032
See yourself. Kai has arrived.

01:01:00.240 --> 01:01:04.315
OK. You look, I'll see.
Acceptable.

01:01:10.017 --> 01:01:13.529
Kai, what are you doing here?
What are you doing here?

01:01:13.638 --> 01:01:18.001
- I came after you.
- It's my fault you're in that cage.

01:01:18.401 --> 01:01:22.563
I shouldn't have left like that.
No Kai, you were right to leave.

01:01:22.863 --> 01:01:25.099
Sekhuru told me what
happened to Mom.

01:01:25.599 --> 01:01:28.459
We broke formation to
go after an iguana.

01:01:28.460 --> 01:01:30.460
To save Sekhuru.

01:01:30.546 --> 01:01:32.726
We all get separated.

01:01:32.926 --> 01:01:35.793
I left Amai to
fight Budzo alone.

01:01:36.193 --> 01:01:39.697
Kai, I have robbed
you of your mother.

01:01:40.189 --> 01:01:42.048
I could not bear
the thought of it.

01:01:42.049 --> 01:01:44.628
No, Dad. Budzo
robbed of my mother.

01:01:45.128 --> 01:01:46.687
You saved Sekhuru and Zoe.

01:01:46.787 --> 01:01:53.247
Dad when you meet Zoe you'll see it.
You're a hero to everyone. To me.

01:01:53.619 --> 01:01:57.104
From where I'm standing,
you're the hero now.

01:01:59.767 --> 01:02:01.767
Let's get outta here.

01:02:05.389 --> 01:02:09.601
- Did you hear that?
- Alright, just you heard it.

01:02:15.357 --> 01:02:17.526
Tini. Where is my Tini.

01:02:17.735 --> 01:02:21.029
- Gogo.
- Tini.

01:02:21.238 --> 01:02:23.949
Tendai. What is he doing here?

01:02:24.742 --> 01:02:27.178
Gogo, I've been trying...

01:02:28.963 --> 01:02:30.144
Wow. That works.

01:02:30.544 --> 01:02:34.363
We are leaving, you have
a problem with that?

01:02:34.452 --> 01:02:39.042
An exit is on the left.
Don't be a stranger.

01:03:08.994 --> 01:03:10.994
Worms.

01:03:40.359 --> 01:03:44.619
Budzo, old chap, a splendid
day for a coup. Huh.

01:03:44.997 --> 01:03:47.273
Consider this a
hostile takeover.

01:03:47.274 --> 01:03:49.274
Oh no, It's up already.

01:03:50.500 --> 01:03:52.900
- Budzo!
- Tendai.

01:03:59.086 --> 01:04:01.891
What is this? You betrayed us.

01:04:02.222 --> 01:04:06.642
You Marabous are just
as naive as Zambezians.

01:04:07.678 --> 01:04:09.678
No.

01:04:14.476 --> 01:04:18.981
Sekhuru, Sekhuru, come quickly.
Iguanas in Zambezia.

01:04:19.189 --> 01:04:21.984
No, impossible.

01:04:22.943 --> 01:04:26.258
Gogo, they must not
reach the eggs.

01:04:27.364 --> 01:04:31.994
Look what you've done. They'll
destroy Zambezia and you with it.

01:04:32.194 --> 01:04:37.683
That treacherous reptile, that was not part of the plan.
He was just meant to be him.

01:04:38.083 --> 01:04:41.487
Wait, Marabous are also birds too.
No birds like us.

01:04:41.587 --> 01:04:44.052
Not after what they've done.

01:04:49.011 --> 01:04:51.757
No, Zambezia is more than a place.
It's an idea.

01:04:51.857 --> 01:04:54.066
The idea is that all
of us are important.

01:04:54.266 --> 01:04:56.534
Even Marabous. Well said.

01:04:56.535 --> 01:04:59.238
If they are willing to help, they
earn the right live here too.

01:04:59.438 --> 01:05:03.258
We've never trusted trusted them before.
Why start now.

01:05:03.358 --> 01:05:08.423
Because we can't call ourselves
Zambezians until we do.

01:05:09.156 --> 01:05:12.811
We're with you. Are we with you?

01:05:12.990 --> 01:05:14.990
Yes, we are.

01:05:18.315 --> 01:05:22.065
- Grab your eggs and gear on.
- We must stand together.

01:05:22.111 --> 01:05:25.121
- But, where are the Hurricanes?
- Right We are sitting ducks without them.

01:05:25.521 --> 01:05:28.133
The Hurricanes are coming.

01:05:28.342 --> 01:05:31.553
In the meantime, we
must stand firm.

01:05:31.762 --> 01:05:33.913
- And we will.
- Tendai?

01:05:33.914 --> 01:05:36.642
Because Zambezia depends on it.

01:05:38.060 --> 01:05:39.059
You have returned.

01:05:39.060 --> 01:05:41.070
Anything happened
while I was gone?

01:05:41.071 --> 01:05:45.684
- I hope you still have some fight in you.
- We have more than that.

01:05:45.984 --> 01:05:48.929
We've got the
Marabous on our side.

01:05:49.029 --> 01:05:52.151
We're doomed. We are doomed.

01:05:52.152 --> 01:05:55.210
I imagined they'll take
it better than this.

01:05:55.410 --> 01:06:01.333
Marabous we have bridge
it we can unbridge it.

01:06:07.848 --> 01:06:11.673
Nurse. Anybody there? Hello?
Where is everybody?

01:06:12.010 --> 01:06:16.685
Is there a party somebody
didn't tell me about?

01:06:22.096 --> 01:06:25.541
Time to call it a
day and fly d'coup.

01:06:25.941 --> 01:06:27.718
Where you gonna go?

01:06:27.818 --> 01:06:30.112
You know what?

01:06:30.178 --> 01:06:33.499
When I first came here I thought
I could do everything myself.

01:06:33.699 --> 01:06:36.475
And then I saw what
Zambezia was all about.

01:06:36.476 --> 01:06:39.713
- I always say, it is easier together. No?
- That's right.

01:06:39.913 --> 01:06:45.652
That's what makes this place special.
That's makes it worth defending.

01:06:45.752 --> 01:06:49.156
The Marabous are down there right
now because they finally get that.

01:06:49.256 --> 01:06:52.659
It's true. They fighting for the home team.
Flip floppers.

01:06:52.759 --> 01:06:55.545
If we all stick together
and we do our part...

01:06:55.546 --> 01:06:58.165
We can win this thing?
Are you with me?

01:06:58.265 --> 01:07:00.645
Budzo is in the nesting area.

01:07:01.268 --> 01:07:05.008
He will address our eggs.
Find your eggs.

01:07:08.358 --> 01:07:11.163
Isn't that just like I want...

01:07:11.278 --> 01:07:14.656
Putting all their
eggs in one basket.

01:07:15.190 --> 01:07:20.671
- Budzo, this ends today.
- No bird can take me.

01:07:21.238 --> 01:07:23.533
Well, we'll see about that.

01:07:34.885 --> 01:07:36.885
Dad.

01:07:36.945 --> 01:07:39.815
That's it, son. Don't let
him get a foot hold.

01:07:40.315 --> 01:07:45.437
This is for brother,
Oh, dear cous.

01:07:47.798 --> 01:07:50.442
Cous, he called me cousin.

01:07:50.450 --> 01:07:53.648
Alright, hold that line.
Come get your beaking...

01:07:53.948 --> 01:07:56.639
in an orderly fashion.

01:07:56.640 --> 01:08:00.728
Target acquired. Steady.
Melons away.

01:08:02.537 --> 01:08:05.290
To the coast. Savages Two.

01:08:19.697 --> 01:08:21.581
No!

01:08:21.680 --> 01:08:24.059
Yes, yes.

01:08:29.106 --> 01:08:31.106
Kai, follow me.

01:08:33.410 --> 01:08:39.189
The 'Cous', is in the ring. Come
and taste of some 'hot wings'.

01:08:40.783 --> 01:08:44.479
Alright, you don't say
things you don't mean.

01:08:44.578 --> 01:08:47.957
Your little experiment
is over old man.

01:08:48.125 --> 01:08:52.337
This community is a
aberration of nature.

01:09:04.026 --> 01:09:05.426
Kai.

01:09:06.952 --> 01:09:08.952
Let him go.

01:09:12.872 --> 01:09:14.073
Dad.

01:09:14.099 --> 01:09:18.255
Hold them back, friends.
Hold them back.

01:09:20.791 --> 01:09:23.710
Zoe, girl, get
back here quickly.

01:09:24.077 --> 01:09:27.027
Put your foot somewhere else.

01:09:27.997 --> 01:09:32.544
This is not my foot.
It's a search party.

01:09:32.551 --> 01:09:33.795
Anyone else there?

01:09:33.796 --> 01:09:35.846
Squad, execute drill
26 on my mark.

01:09:36.147 --> 01:09:39.292
Where are you?
Three, two, one...

01:09:39.718 --> 01:09:41.845
HEEEEELP.

01:09:42.053 --> 01:09:44.598
HEEEEEELP

01:09:46.734 --> 01:09:50.642
Let'em hear you. More Higher.
More Desperate.

01:09:53.231 --> 01:09:57.056
Where is the search party?
You're looking at her.

01:09:57.110 --> 01:09:59.721
But you're not even licensed.

01:09:59.821 --> 01:10:01.948
Oh, I'm gonna fall again.

01:10:01.957 --> 01:10:05.234
Budzo have our eggs. It's over.
Holy crackers...

01:10:05.235 --> 01:10:08.326
We are living in a cuckoo clock.
Oh, goodness.

01:10:08.327 --> 01:10:11.206
- We hold until then to do something?
- You think you can take on Budzo?

01:10:11.606 --> 01:10:13.705
What about all of us?

01:10:13.805 --> 01:10:17.552
Exactly what Kai said,
together we can do anything.

01:10:18.381 --> 01:10:21.425
You are an inspiration. You are
an inspiration to other birds.

01:10:21.426 --> 01:10:24.751
I do not know how you do it. That
is a very heavy method to carry.

01:10:44.157 --> 01:10:48.186
Is this what the mighty
Zambezia has come to?

01:10:48.286 --> 01:10:51.206
Well, Show me what you got.

01:10:57.295 --> 01:11:02.050
I have to say, I'm a
little underwhelmed.

01:11:02.059 --> 01:11:04.794
If you mess with my
fella you mess with me.

01:11:04.795 --> 01:11:07.685
I poke in your eye
with a macadamia.

01:11:30.512 --> 01:11:32.580
Take that.

01:11:32.789 --> 01:11:34.441
Orange is a bit too much.
You think so?

01:11:34.541 --> 01:11:37.902
- I would got my short trouser.
- Really?

01:11:37.903 --> 01:11:41.640
Why those Weavers have
to be so brilliant?

01:11:41.840 --> 01:11:45.310
Hurricanes, stay as you go.
Target up ahead.

01:11:45.911 --> 01:11:49.615
Three, two, one... Release.

01:12:08.241 --> 01:12:12.070
Marabous on our side? What next?

01:12:16.374 --> 01:12:17.999
- Father.
- Zoe.

01:12:18.000 --> 01:12:20.503
- Coming in hot.
- Line it up.

01:12:24.107 --> 01:12:26.487
Save your wings, men.

01:12:30.914 --> 01:12:35.634
- I've had enough from this lizard.
- Execute drill 46.

01:12:35.935 --> 01:12:41.733
On my mark. Three, two, one.

01:13:14.682 --> 01:13:16.768
- Kai.
- Zoe.

01:13:17.644 --> 01:13:19.644
No.

01:13:21.481 --> 01:13:23.481
Help.

01:13:25.693 --> 01:13:27.693
Help.

01:13:32.158 --> 01:13:34.160
Help.

01:13:38.039 --> 01:13:43.503
- Pull up, Kai, pull up.
- I'm not leaving you.

01:14:35.930 --> 01:14:39.517
My fella.

01:14:52.772 --> 01:14:58.297
I'm gonna smack him for that
heart attack he just gave me.

01:15:10.190 --> 01:15:13.693
Just like old times, huh?

01:15:20.142 --> 01:15:23.387
- In the club now.
- He's my cousin. You know.

01:15:24.387 --> 01:15:30.393
- Oh Yes, he is. A very strong bloodline.
- I've got me eye on you, hot rod.

01:15:32.721 --> 01:15:34.846
Your mother would be proud.

01:15:36.183 --> 01:15:38.794
- I am proud too.
- Thanks Dad.

01:15:39.494 --> 01:15:45.166
- Dad, this is Zoe.
- I was the little egg you saved.

01:15:45.333 --> 01:15:49.583
- It's such an honor to meet you.
- The honor is mine.

01:15:55.877 --> 01:16:01.508
On this day we can truly
say that no bird...

01:16:04.811 --> 01:16:08.523
is an out-island.

01:16:20.760 --> 01:16:23.305
- What is he doing.
- I'm grooving, I'm grooving.

01:16:23.613 --> 01:16:27.075
Let's call it the
'funky chicken'.

01:16:27.542 --> 01:16:33.298
- This is amazing.
- No, Dad. It's amazeeng.

01:17:01.909 --> 01:17:05.253
Look what happens when
I flip my wing up.

01:17:05.353 --> 01:17:07.673
- Beautiful.
- A secret blue.

01:17:07.674 --> 01:17:12.604
- Thank you, I call it blue-tiful.
- Now This is how you take it Ezee.

01:17:23.914 --> 01:17:26.225
Pudding. At last.

01:17:40.357 --> 01:17:45.572
Then I fighted old Budzo single-handed
and I was nothing less than...

01:17:46.940 --> 01:17:48.648
Magnificent.

01:17:48.748 --> 01:17:50.748
He was magnificent.

01:17:51.042 --> 01:17:56.057
I look good when I do this, don't I?
Yes, I do.

01:18:19.904 --> 01:18:22.115
A new arrival.

01:18:27.161 --> 01:18:29.956
Hello, how about a snack?

01:18:30.164 --> 01:18:32.164
How about two?
