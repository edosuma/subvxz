00:16.440 --> 00:17.440
Isabella,

00:18.620 --> 00:21.318
if I wanted to kill you,
you'd be already dead.

00:21.438 --> 00:22.788
What do you want?

00:23.204 --> 00:25.320
I want to know why you've done
a deal with the devil.

00:25.862 --> 00:27.240
Why do you care?

00:27.441 --> 00:29.160
The Prince... is evil.

00:29.945 --> 00:33.045
It's not every day
a prince asks you to be Sheriff.

00:33.447 --> 00:34.920
Especially if you're a woman.

00:35.080 --> 00:38.880
- You'll be working with a traitor.
- No. I'm working for myself.

00:39.436 --> 00:42.720
I intend to be the best Sheriff
Nottingham has ever seen.

00:44.393 --> 00:46.375
And you'll see
for yourself tomorrow.

00:46.495 --> 00:47.495
No.

00:48.122 --> 00:51.022
It'll never work,
because the Prince will fall.

00:52.176 --> 00:53.640
And you will fall...

00:54.003 --> 00:55.520
- unless...
- What?

00:56.349 --> 00:58.049
Unless you work with me,

00:59.007 --> 01:02.057
keep me in the picture,
tell me the Prince's plans

01:02.406 --> 01:04.400
and I'll protect you
when the King returns.

01:08.362 --> 01:10.021
What if I don't want
to be your friend?

01:10.141 --> 01:12.960
Then you'll find out
what it is to be my enemy.

01:13.413 --> 01:15.480
Are you threatening me, Robin Hood?

01:16.171 --> 01:18.640
I could destroy you
whenever I choose.

01:18.841 --> 01:20.240
So what's stopping you?

01:21.952 --> 01:23.281
Guards!

01:30.222 --> 01:32.122
You think it over, Isabella.

01:32.527 --> 01:34.960
The offer's open, but not for ever.

01:42.020 --> 01:44.366
It's Robin Hood.
Well, sound the alarm!

01:44.486 --> 01:46.720
<i>Quick! Stop him! Guard the exit!</i>

02:07.795 --> 02:08.794
I swear...

02:10.520 --> 02:13.960
<i>Find Hood! I want every corner
of Nottingham searched!</i>

02:19.792 --> 02:21.192
Trouble, Isabella?

02:21.312 --> 02:22.320
<i>Guards!</i>

02:22.480 --> 02:24.480
You haven't seen anything yet!

02:27.780 --> 02:31.760
The Sub Wood Team

03:04.400 --> 03:06.600
Episode nine
A DANGEROUS DEAL

03:06.761 --> 03:10.262
- This should be interesting.
- Well, not that interesting.

03:10.560 --> 03:12.398
What exactly are we doing here?

03:12.518 --> 03:15.650
Robin thinks he can charm our new
Sheriff into working with outlaws.

03:15.770 --> 03:18.668
Look, let's just see
what she's made of, shall we?

03:18.788 --> 03:21.800
Well, it's not sugar and spice
and all things nice.

03:24.388 --> 03:25.588
<i>Meg Bennett...</i>

03:26.243 --> 03:30.200
the Sheriff's Court has heard
of your disobedience to your father...

03:30.624 --> 03:33.800
and your refusal to accept
any suitors he chose for you.

03:34.109 --> 03:37.893
Lady Sheriff, one was a drunken sot,
the second looked like a donkey,

03:38.013 --> 03:40.480
the third was a halfwit
with the brains of a tree!

03:40.641 --> 03:42.760
- You little wretch...
- Please!

03:44.604 --> 03:47.480
And the fourth, you apparently
bribed to go back to York

03:47.641 --> 03:49.691
with money you stole
from your father.

03:49.811 --> 03:52.311
He was a mummy's boy!
What use is that?

03:53.078 --> 03:57.040
Meg, tell the court why you acted
in such a deplorable fashion.

03:57.241 --> 04:00.400
Because I won't accept anyone
telling me how to live my own life.

04:01.112 --> 04:03.987
I don't want to marry! Men are so...

04:04.703 --> 04:05.720
stupid!

04:06.960 --> 04:07.960
Quiet!

04:10.083 --> 04:12.840
I think England would be a much better
place, if women were in charge.

04:13.285 --> 04:14.559
Dream on, girl.

04:16.382 --> 04:17.680
- Untie her.
- What?

04:17.998 --> 04:18.998
Thank you!

04:20.959 --> 04:22.610
People of Nottingham...

04:23.954 --> 04:27.143
... now maybe you can see
the kind of Sheriff I am.

04:27.903 --> 04:30.224
And as I've set Meg here free,

04:31.689 --> 04:35.431
I intend to set the whole
of Nottingham free...

04:38.046 --> 04:39.564
to be a fairer...

04:40.161 --> 04:43.036
more peaceful and prosperous
place for us all!

04:46.564 --> 04:49.064
You are far too bright
to be locked up.

04:50.130 --> 04:52.730
I think I need people
like you around me.

04:56.571 --> 04:59.826
The last regime
was brutal and corrupt.

05:00.463 --> 05:03.913
And in recognition of crimes
committed against the people,

05:04.842 --> 05:05.892
my brother,

05:06.721 --> 05:08.226
Guy of Gisborne,

05:08.665 --> 05:11.730
shall be executed here
on Thursday at midday.

05:12.027 --> 05:14.320
See? Maybe we can work with her.

05:14.726 --> 05:16.239
Yeah... We'll see.

05:19.501 --> 05:20.586
Bravo!

05:21.890 --> 05:23.430
Isn't she marvellous?

05:23.550 --> 05:25.680
How I've missed you.

05:26.420 --> 05:27.830
My lovely wife!

05:31.465 --> 05:32.515
Get off me.

05:34.137 --> 05:35.832
I'm your new Sheriff.

05:37.161 --> 05:39.066
Thornton at your service.

05:39.641 --> 05:43.360
<i>I'm sure you'll understand that my wife
now has me to care for, leaving me</i>

05:43.637 --> 05:44.960
to care for you.

05:45.517 --> 05:48.600
Rest assured you are
in firm and capable hands.

05:50.280 --> 05:52.200
Now, if you'll excuse me,

05:52.609 --> 05:55.480
the little wife and I
have some catching up to do.

05:57.560 --> 05:59.440
There'll be no deal with Thornton.

06:01.949 --> 06:04.651
We should get going. The villagers
will be expecting a food drop.

06:04.771 --> 06:06.280
I know. You go.

06:06.666 --> 06:08.755
I need to stay here
and find out his next move.

06:08.875 --> 06:10.806
Fine. I'm staying too.

06:11.110 --> 06:13.287
No, it's all right, Much. You go.

06:13.721 --> 06:15.608
- I'll stay.
- Go on.

06:22.324 --> 06:25.090
You ran away! You deserted me!

06:26.642 --> 06:28.920
I loved you, cared for you.

06:30.331 --> 06:33.240
- We were so happy together.
- How can you say that?

06:38.729 --> 06:39.775
<i>Guards!</i>

06:39.895 --> 06:40.800
No!

06:41.383 --> 06:43.440
Take him, he's attacking
your Sheriff!

06:43.600 --> 06:45.450
That's enough, let her go.

06:46.802 --> 06:47.940
{\Take him }To the dungeons!

06:48.060 --> 06:50.659
Do you want Prince John to know
he has a criminal for a Sheriff?

06:50.779 --> 06:54.202
- He appointed me. He trusts me.
- You abandoned your husband,

06:54.322 --> 06:56.160
broke man's law and God's.

06:57.617 --> 07:01.600
{\Now, }My men will ride to him at nightfall
if they receive no word of my safety.

07:03.188 --> 07:05.519
Release me or it's over.

07:13.037 --> 07:14.040
Let him go.

07:26.268 --> 07:29.080
And now it's time
I taught you some respect.

07:33.531 --> 07:34.699
Stop it, please!

07:34.819 --> 07:37.200
If you promise not to hurt her,
I can make you rich.

07:37.361 --> 07:38.880
- Away with her.
- It's true.

07:39.519 --> 07:42.969
I know where gold coins are buried.
Handfuls and handfuls.

07:43.166 --> 07:45.559
- Where?
- There's a mound...

07:48.699 --> 07:50.525
near Dead Man's Crossing,
in the forest.

07:50.645 --> 07:52.045
I think I know it.

07:53.253 --> 07:54.803
If you've told a lie,

07:55.346 --> 07:56.796
it'll be your last.

07:57.700 --> 07:58.800
Lock her up.

08:00.499 --> 08:03.240
Listen. I won't rest
until you're free.

08:04.295 --> 08:05.987
Look at them, boys.

08:06.560 --> 08:09.210
The ladies are getting
a little emotional.

08:12.560 --> 08:13.861
You stay strong.

08:16.165 --> 08:17.215
Get off me!

08:17.972 --> 08:20.510
- Thornton's dangerous.
- For Isabella, maybe.

08:20.630 --> 08:24.630
- No, for Nottingham, for everyone.
- Whereas your Isabella's an angel.

08:25.162 --> 08:27.520
I just think we can work
together with her, unlike him.

08:27.680 --> 08:29.329
- You are so wrong.
- I'm not wrong!

08:29.449 --> 08:31.066
- Can't you see?
- See what?

08:31.186 --> 08:33.068
Can't you see her
for what she really is?

08:33.188 --> 08:35.200
Kate, why are you so angry with me?

08:53.563 --> 08:56.013
Right... well...
I should probably go.

09:04.800 --> 09:05.850
Get off me!

09:06.215 --> 09:07.215
Let go!

09:11.708 --> 09:14.558
I'll make you pay for this,
you rancid brutes!

09:17.289 --> 09:20.560
Men! If I had my way,
they'd all disappear

09:20.721 --> 09:24.171
in a puff of smoke and the world
would be a happier place.

09:25.720 --> 09:27.420
What are you staring at?

09:29.364 --> 09:30.480
I know you.

09:31.445 --> 09:34.145
You're him, aren't you?
Isabella's brother?

09:35.784 --> 09:38.944
- She's a friend of mine.
- Not that close, obviously.

09:39.064 --> 09:41.200
Her nasty husband
did this to me, clever.

09:41.491 --> 09:42.491
Thornton?

09:44.088 --> 09:45.138
Is he here?

09:47.063 --> 09:48.240
She's terrified of him.

09:48.411 --> 09:50.794
She shouldn't have left him,
then, should she?

09:50.914 --> 09:53.240
You always were a bit
pleased with yourself.

09:54.455 --> 09:55.838
I saw you once.

09:56.948 --> 09:59.480
The man in black on his black horse.

09:59.973 --> 10:01.400
The big "I am".

10:04.040 --> 10:05.160
Look at you now.

10:06.226 --> 10:07.826
Dirty and miserable...

10:08.681 --> 10:09.681
and small!

10:11.581 --> 10:13.920
And now you're going to be executed.

10:14.121 --> 10:16.360
By the look of it,
you might not be far behind.

10:19.293 --> 10:20.893
I hope you go to hell!

10:24.680 --> 10:26.080
I'm already there.

10:55.698 --> 10:56.891
This is it.

11:00.783 --> 11:02.083
Get going, then.

11:04.640 --> 11:06.312
- You expect...
- Don't you understand?

11:06.432 --> 11:10.048
Every time you cross me,
every little word or action,

11:10.168 --> 11:13.387
you make it worse for yourself
when I get you on my own...

11:13.507 --> 11:15.999
in a small, dark room.

11:18.904 --> 11:19.904
Now go on.

11:21.738 --> 11:23.120
Prove you love me.

11:23.759 --> 11:24.859
Get digging.

11:42.883 --> 11:45.983
If this is a wild goose chase,
I'll kill that girl.

12:07.691 --> 12:08.691
Look.

12:09.128 --> 12:10.178
Let me see.

12:22.480 --> 12:25.800
You, get some more men.
You, what are you waiting for?

12:25.920 --> 12:27.020
Get digging!

12:30.342 --> 12:32.342
<i>Well, come on, get on with it.</i>

12:32.857 --> 12:35.416
<i>No, no, not there, you idiots!</i>

12:35.536 --> 12:38.040
- He really is a pig, isn't he?
- Yep.

12:38.526 --> 12:41.676
At last there's something
you and Isabella agree on.

12:43.720 --> 12:44.720
Listen...

12:46.421 --> 12:49.071
- about what happened earlier...
- I know.

12:49.657 --> 12:50.657
I'm sorry.

12:51.594 --> 12:52.600
What for?

12:54.360 --> 12:56.408
It's difficult. Isn't it?

12:57.140 --> 12:58.140
Is it?

13:00.421 --> 13:03.371
- Why, because of Isabella?
- No, not because...

13:05.728 --> 13:07.528
It's just the way we live.

13:08.114 --> 13:09.307
You know...

13:10.659 --> 13:13.100
- and then there's Much.
- Much?

13:13.681 --> 13:17.281
<i>Right, you lot, I want the treasure
out of here by nightfall.</i>

13:18.226 --> 13:20.219
I'd best get the others.

13:27.796 --> 13:28.599
What?

13:29.879 --> 13:31.520
Just look after yourself.

13:31.680 --> 13:32.480
Yeah.

13:33.514 --> 13:34.714
Yeah, you too.

13:40.569 --> 13:43.105
Just leave it, will you?

13:44.136 --> 13:45.280
It hurts!

13:47.512 --> 13:49.862
That's why they do it.
Deal with it.

13:52.804 --> 13:55.904
- I'm thirsty.
- {\Well, then}Save your breath and stop whining.

13:56.206 --> 13:58.306
Nasty piece of work, aren't you?

13:58.579 --> 14:00.779
No wonder Isabella wants you dead.

14:03.144 --> 14:05.440
- What did you do to her, anyway?
- Give me strength!

14:06.028 --> 14:08.600
It's almost worth dying
to be spared your endless chatter.

14:08.720 --> 14:10.770
Come on. You're here, I'm here.

14:11.641 --> 14:13.591
What else are we going to do?

14:16.649 --> 14:19.686
I found her a husband,
that's what I did.

14:22.779 --> 14:24.189
Good price, too.

14:24.487 --> 14:27.248
You sold her?! Your own sister?

14:27.368 --> 14:30.200
It was her best chance in life. Not
my fault she went and made a mess of it.

14:30.360 --> 14:33.096
Well, of course it is. All of it.
You sold her to a monster!

14:33.216 --> 14:36.480
You stupid girl.
You know nothing about it.

14:36.720 --> 14:38.406
I'm not "stupid girl".

14:39.022 --> 14:40.022
I'm Meg.

14:41.122 --> 14:42.600
And I'm still thirsty.

14:45.011 --> 14:46.959
That stone around your neck.

14:47.760 --> 14:48.793
Suck it.

14:49.918 --> 14:51.640
It'll make your mouth water.

15:04.481 --> 15:07.080
Burial mound.
Danish, by the look of it.

15:07.875 --> 15:11.325
They placed curses on horses' heads
to ward off intruders.

15:18.561 --> 15:20.011
What are you doing?

15:40.868 --> 15:43.824
Get a grip.
It's just a horse's head.

15:44.647 --> 15:46.480
Golden bridle. Nice.

15:47.102 --> 15:48.952
I'd say that's a chief's.

15:49.218 --> 15:52.720
It's the treasure. They bury it with
them for the long journey to Valhalla.

15:52.881 --> 15:55.200
Where is that?
It's near Norwich, isn't it?

15:55.923 --> 15:58.473
No, Allan, Valhalla
is Norse for heaven.

16:03.557 --> 16:04.957
My beautiful wife.

16:09.594 --> 16:12.744
What's going on
in that pretty little head of yours?

16:13.187 --> 16:14.437
Nothing at all.

16:16.128 --> 16:17.400
Just the way you like it.

16:22.288 --> 16:23.788
What have you taken?

16:25.162 --> 16:27.236
Steal from me, would you?

16:29.338 --> 16:30.838
He was just looking!

16:32.799 --> 16:34.899
Let that be a lesson to you all!

16:37.515 --> 16:38.975
Now get the cart!

16:39.400 --> 16:42.040
The sooner the gold's back
in Nottingham, the better.

16:44.604 --> 16:46.440
Right. We get rid of him.

16:46.746 --> 16:48.400
Let's take his gold first.

16:48.561 --> 16:50.265
And make Isabella Sheriff again?

16:50.385 --> 16:53.520
Sheriff! We'll have a donkey
for Archbishop next.

16:54.013 --> 16:57.520
Kate, I want you to stay and watch
the hoard. Much, you too.

16:57.681 --> 17:00.131
The rest of you come with me.
Come on.

17:04.295 --> 17:06.145
<i>Hey, you, stop there! Stop.</i>

17:06.817 --> 17:07.880
<i>Stop, I say!</i>

17:09.069 --> 17:10.619
You're on my land.

17:12.083 --> 17:14.960
Well, you pay me a toll,
I guess we might forget about it.

17:16.390 --> 17:17.960
That's not very nice, now, is it?

17:26.708 --> 17:27.958
Are you scared?

17:28.823 --> 17:29.823
What of?

17:31.120 --> 17:32.120
"What of?"

17:34.125 --> 17:36.320
Your date with the executioner.

17:36.592 --> 17:37.720
Do I look scared?

17:40.106 --> 17:41.120
Actually, no.

17:42.582 --> 17:45.800
Terrible, yes. One out of ten
for personal appearance,

17:47.042 --> 17:48.160
but not frightened.

17:49.888 --> 17:51.438
I'm almost impressed.

17:53.904 --> 17:56.504
It's as if you've got
a clear conscience.

17:58.717 --> 18:00.387
Well, why shouldn't I have?

18:00.507 --> 18:03.240
Because of all the awful things
you've done in your life.

18:03.689 --> 18:05.135
I mean, no one...

18:05.656 --> 18:08.480
actually seems sorry that you're
on the way out, do they?

18:09.407 --> 18:11.257
Does that not make you sad?

18:12.396 --> 18:14.796
I can't help
what people think of me.

18:15.650 --> 18:17.120
What's done is done.

18:18.057 --> 18:20.200
And if I am to die, then so be it.

18:20.320 --> 18:24.320
Is your life really that empty that you
don't care whether you live or die?

18:35.317 --> 18:36.560
I'm starving.

18:57.852 --> 18:58.852
Here.

19:00.807 --> 19:02.407
Keep your strength up.

19:09.532 --> 19:11.782
There must be some good in you yet.

19:13.306 --> 19:14.706
You don't know me.

19:18.400 --> 19:19.400
Besides,

19:20.444 --> 19:22.144
I thought you hated men.

19:23.644 --> 19:24.644
I do.

19:27.575 --> 19:28.575
I do.

19:33.675 --> 19:36.116
<i>Start loading the gold now
onto the cart!</i>

19:36.236 --> 19:38.280
- Much!
- What?

19:38.609 --> 19:40.839
Can I talk to you about something?

19:43.595 --> 19:45.080
I really like Robin.

19:46.680 --> 19:48.380
And I think he likes me.

19:51.191 --> 19:54.491
But he won't let anything happen,
maybe because of you.

19:55.677 --> 19:57.480
Would you talk to him for me?

19:58.404 --> 20:00.554
Tell him that we're just friends?

20:03.032 --> 20:04.035
Yeah,

20:04.754 --> 20:05.759
of course.

20:06.937 --> 20:07.960
Thanks.

20:09.311 --> 20:11.765
Right. We're almost ready.

20:12.606 --> 20:15.591
Much, when the cart's ready,
I want you to get it out of there.

20:15.711 --> 20:17.420
All right? Good luck.

20:32.299 --> 20:33.699
Thanks, my friend.

20:33.899 --> 20:36.520
I shall enjoy spending
your ill-gotten gains!

20:36.681 --> 20:38.720
Be careful. Might come back
to haunt you.

20:39.737 --> 20:42.120
You're the one who's living
a nightmare, precious.

20:44.099 --> 20:45.699
That's it. We're done.

20:50.445 --> 20:51.480
Start loading!

20:52.587 --> 20:54.437
<i>Right, let's get it loaded.</i>

21:04.080 --> 21:05.840
Isn't this my lucky day?

21:06.467 --> 21:10.160
My first day as Sheriff
and untold riches fall into my lap!

21:10.280 --> 21:12.294
Luck can easily change.

21:17.161 --> 21:18.561
<i>Right, let's go...</i>

21:19.449 --> 21:22.049
This hoard isn't yours to take,
Thornton.

21:22.403 --> 21:24.120
And who's going to stop me?

21:24.281 --> 21:25.331
Robin Hood!

21:30.751 --> 21:32.600
Isabella, I haven't finished
with you yet!

21:32.720 --> 21:33.840
Get back!

21:34.000 --> 21:36.840
You lot, with me. The rest,
get the cart out of here!

21:38.881 --> 21:40.131
Much, the cart!

21:48.681 --> 21:50.080
<i>I really like Robin...</i>

21:52.444 --> 21:54.080
<i>and I think he likes me.</i>

22:05.920 --> 22:08.800
- Get after them!
- Much!

22:15.759 --> 22:16.852
Isabella!

22:18.517 --> 22:19.574
Isabella!

22:24.104 --> 22:25.343
Wait! Wait!

22:25.463 --> 22:27.013
- Much!
- I'm sorry.

22:27.298 --> 22:30.080
We haven't got time for this.
We have to find Thornton.

22:33.737 --> 22:36.920
- There's something I have to tell you.
- What are you talking about?

22:39.517 --> 22:41.256
Come on, we have to go!

23:17.780 --> 23:18.780
Robin.

23:21.051 --> 23:22.359
Oh, thank God...

23:29.121 --> 23:30.320
Are you all right?

23:32.520 --> 23:35.670
I was a fool to turn my back on you.
Please help me.

23:36.872 --> 23:40.440
If you promise to fight with us for
King Richard, then I'll protect you.

23:40.560 --> 23:41.949
Yes. Of course.

23:43.995 --> 23:45.455
You and me, Robin.

23:47.570 --> 23:49.520
I think we can work together.

23:50.236 --> 23:52.200
I've always known it
and I think you do too.

23:54.991 --> 23:57.480
- It's a deal.
- You won't regret this.

23:59.384 --> 24:00.562
How can I repay you?

24:00.682 --> 24:02.800
Well, you can start
by handing over the gold

24:03.168 --> 24:04.640
tomorrow at Knight's Glade.

24:04.760 --> 24:06.832
Of course, you must
give it back to the people.

24:06.952 --> 24:09.152
- It's theirs, after all.
- Good.

24:10.110 --> 24:12.640
Isabella, you'll suffer for this!

24:12.912 --> 24:13.991
Isabella!

24:14.746 --> 24:17.640
John, escort the Sheriff
back to her castle.

24:18.796 --> 24:20.701
- Thank you.
- This way.

24:26.682 --> 24:28.638
She always manages to get
what she wants.

24:28.758 --> 24:31.264
Kate, just leave it, please.

24:40.305 --> 24:41.440
Isabella!

24:48.339 --> 24:52.189
I don't like this. You shouldn't
have touched that burial mound.

24:52.309 --> 24:53.520
Superstitious peasant!

24:58.494 --> 25:00.005
They're just bats.

25:02.329 --> 25:04.179
Get back here, you cowards!

25:14.523 --> 25:16.517
You have disturbed the dead.

25:18.468 --> 25:19.920
<i>Somebody help me...</i>

25:20.348 --> 25:21.452
Come back!

25:22.182 --> 25:23.920
You invoked the Viking curse

25:24.612 --> 25:28.120
to be visited by suffering,
madness and death!

25:28.784 --> 25:30.434
Playing with the devil.

25:33.329 --> 25:34.929
Big mistake, Thornton.

25:38.253 --> 25:40.103
You don't say much, do you?

25:40.809 --> 25:42.188
Robin sees you as an ally.

25:42.308 --> 25:45.080
- Strictly business.
- Typical man.

25:45.508 --> 25:49.099
There's nothing ever strictly
business between a man and a woman.

25:49.219 --> 25:52.680
If he has done a deal with you, it's for
the good of the cause, nothing else.

25:52.800 --> 25:55.479
- How can you be so sure?
- Because I know Robin.

25:55.599 --> 25:59.349
My guess is if he's got eyes
for anyone, it's for Kate, not you.

26:02.320 --> 26:06.320
We found him in the forest babbling
something about Viking ghosts.

26:07.651 --> 26:09.320
He needs to be locked up.

26:09.440 --> 26:11.520
Yep.
Madhouse is the best place for him.

26:11.640 --> 26:14.740
He's a danger to himself
and the people around him.

26:17.201 --> 26:19.807
If he mentions something
about being Sheriff of Nottingham,

26:19.927 --> 26:21.277
pay no attention.

26:23.072 --> 26:24.760
He was the Queen of Sheba last week.

26:27.759 --> 26:29.800
Nottingham's well rid of you,
Thornton.

26:30.700 --> 26:32.719
And don't even think of coming back.

26:32.839 --> 26:36.389
Because if you do, your next
destination won't be an asylum,

26:36.597 --> 26:38.497
but where you really belong.

26:38.717 --> 26:39.723
Hell.

26:47.819 --> 26:49.038
Release her.

26:49.989 --> 26:52.600
Isabella, you're back!
Thank goodness.

26:52.920 --> 26:55.868
I'm not sure my brother will feel
the same. Come on, let's go.

26:55.988 --> 26:57.720
Won't you release Guy too?

26:57.840 --> 26:59.920
What? Are you mad? He's our enemy!

27:00.040 --> 27:01.777
But... You see?

27:02.481 --> 27:04.681
Do you see how they manipulate us?

27:04.961 --> 27:06.972
A few hours in a cell with a...

27:07.092 --> 27:09.760
cold-hearted killer
and even you lose your wits.

27:09.880 --> 27:11.880
That's the poison of men, Meg.

27:12.149 --> 27:13.640
None of them can be trusted.

27:14.352 --> 27:17.152
My brother will get
exactly what he deserves.

27:17.289 --> 27:18.389
Now come on.

28:36.381 --> 28:39.250
Thank you, but no...

28:40.033 --> 28:41.366
You must eat.

28:43.000 --> 28:44.000
For me.

28:46.124 --> 28:47.574
The least I can do.

28:48.034 --> 28:49.984
You've done more than enough.

28:50.480 --> 28:53.160
- I haven't done anything.
- You have.

28:54.710 --> 28:56.488
You've made me think.

28:57.423 --> 28:58.477
About what?

28:59.561 --> 29:01.646
About someone I used to know.

29:04.228 --> 29:06.428
She saw good where there was none.

29:07.968 --> 29:09.760
She made me a better man.

29:11.859 --> 29:13.059
What happened?

29:16.841 --> 29:18.158
I destroyed her.

29:20.101 --> 29:21.440
I destroyed everything.

29:26.268 --> 29:27.277
Go on.

29:36.680 --> 29:40.430
I want some guards behind me
and I want the rest of them hidden.

29:40.643 --> 29:42.675
Understood? Good.

29:50.094 --> 29:53.753
"Sire, I write to you

29:54.612 --> 29:56.468
"with a grave confession

29:57.905 --> 30:01.359
"that I hope you will find
in your heart to forgive.

30:06.403 --> 30:08.150
"By way of an apology,

30:08.786 --> 30:12.329
"I would like to offer you...
a gift."

30:27.062 --> 30:28.062
Meg?

30:31.165 --> 30:34.217
- What are you doing?
- I can't let her kill you. I can't.

30:34.337 --> 30:35.887
You'd do this for me?

30:40.424 --> 30:41.466
Thank you.

30:44.383 --> 30:46.852
- Well, this is touching!
- Go!

30:47.357 --> 30:50.161
- Guards!
- She didn't know what she was doing.

30:50.281 --> 30:52.732
Oh, yes, she did. How could you?

30:53.804 --> 30:55.886
I set you free
and this is how you repay me?

30:56.006 --> 30:58.197
We're not the same.
I try to do things out of love.

30:58.317 --> 31:01.317
- You're doing this out of hate!
- How dare you?!

31:02.165 --> 31:04.215
I suppose I should be grateful.

31:04.857 --> 31:08.280
Now I know the only person
I can trust is myself. I'm on my own.

31:08.512 --> 31:12.280
- You put yourself there, Isabella.
- I could say the same for you.

31:14.378 --> 31:17.040
And if you two love birds
want to be together,

31:17.587 --> 31:19.517
that's fine. You shall.

31:21.548 --> 31:22.600
You'll both die.

31:26.265 --> 31:29.955
Come on, we don't want to be late
for Knight's Glade. Where's Much?

31:30.075 --> 31:32.575
Probably attempting to catch
breakfast.

31:32.742 --> 31:34.640
Kate, are you all right?

31:35.866 --> 31:36.866
Fine.

31:37.485 --> 31:38.680
Let's just go.

31:39.146 --> 31:40.960
You don't want to be late
for Isabella.

31:41.121 --> 31:44.493
This is for the good of everyone.
If we can get a Sheriff working...

31:44.613 --> 31:46.680
- Yeah, I know.
- Will you listen to me?

31:48.048 --> 31:50.658
When we get back, I think we need
to sort a few things out.

31:50.778 --> 31:51.778
Robin...

31:52.722 --> 31:54.572
... there's really no need.

31:54.987 --> 31:56.840
She's obviously your priority.

32:03.136 --> 32:07.136
She's worth more than any treasure.
Don't let her slip through your fingers.

32:56.126 --> 32:57.360
You came, then.

32:58.496 --> 32:59.575
I am glad.

33:00.767 --> 33:03.824
Of course. We had a deal,
you and me. Remember?

33:03.944 --> 33:06.560
- I do remember.
- Working together.

33:06.872 --> 33:08.276
For the good of Nottingham.

33:08.396 --> 33:10.837
Absolutely. That's all
that matters now, isn't it?

33:10.957 --> 33:12.957
Please take it. You earned it.

33:15.016 --> 33:17.416
You were my knight
in shining armour.

33:18.288 --> 33:19.360
Yeah, that's me.

33:26.221 --> 33:27.221
Robin!

33:30.130 --> 33:32.440
Life's full of disappointment,
isn't it?

33:43.529 --> 33:46.329
Now I've decided
to stand on my own two feet.

33:46.680 --> 33:48.550
I thought about what you said.

33:48.670 --> 33:51.030
Obey your every command,
do whatever you say.

33:51.150 --> 33:54.114
- I offered you friendship.
- No, you threatened me.

33:54.234 --> 33:56.784
I won't be some frightened
little woman.

33:57.073 --> 33:58.480
Go on! Take them!

34:02.002 --> 34:04.960
- Well, it looks like you were right.
- I usually am.

34:05.297 --> 34:08.840
- Next time you might just listen.
- If there is a next time.

34:10.560 --> 34:11.598
Robin!

34:19.385 --> 34:20.476
Come on!

34:28.001 --> 34:30.389
- Kate, come on!
- Get them!

34:31.089 --> 34:32.092
Kate!

34:44.333 --> 34:46.280
{\pos(192,220)}
So where did you go, then?

34:46.697 --> 34:47.889
Er, nowhere.

34:48.670 --> 34:51.121
I just wanted to be alone,
that's all.

34:51.918 --> 34:54.027
Hey, come on. You can tell me.

34:54.857 --> 34:57.599
You weren't leaving, were you? Much?

34:59.361 --> 35:02.280
- Where did you spring up from, eh?
- Er...

35:04.138 --> 35:05.538
Are you all right?

35:05.922 --> 35:07.789
Yeah, I'm fine.

35:08.641 --> 35:10.291
Robin, what's the plan?

35:11.106 --> 35:14.383
We're going to take
that hoard back, today.

35:14.761 --> 35:18.480
- What about Gisborne's execution?
- Well, that's the perfect distraction.

35:41.680 --> 35:44.184
We'll make our move when
everybody's looking to the platform.

35:44.304 --> 35:46.108
When he comes out, we slip inside.

35:46.228 --> 35:49.480
Allan, Tuck, go through the armoury.
John, through the kitchens with Much.

35:49.810 --> 35:53.760
Kate, you come with me to the west
gate. We'll go from there. Go on.

36:05.190 --> 36:06.760
Bring out the prisoners.

36:15.220 --> 36:16.223
The girl.

36:18.491 --> 36:21.679
- I'm scared.
- When it comes, it'll be very quick.

36:27.302 --> 36:28.799
Come on, this way.

36:37.168 --> 36:40.117
As you all know
from bitter experience,

36:40.237 --> 36:43.040
Guy of Gisborne
is an enemy of the people.

36:43.449 --> 36:45.480
He must pay the ultimate penalty.

36:47.080 --> 36:48.225
This woman

36:48.595 --> 36:51.972
tried to help him escape justice,
therefore

36:52.441 --> 36:54.141
she must share his fate.

36:55.199 --> 36:58.742
In future,
if anyone challenges my authority,

37:00.370 --> 37:03.039
they shall suffer
the same punishment.

37:06.117 --> 37:08.694
Have the condemned any final words?

37:09.733 --> 37:11.683
Very well, Isabella. You win.

37:13.328 --> 37:15.478
Kill me if you must, but not her.

37:17.157 --> 37:18.957
I'll do whatever you want,

37:19.351 --> 37:21.040
but don't take her life.

37:25.414 --> 37:28.964
- Proceed with the execution!
- She's just an innocent girl!

37:32.677 --> 37:33.985
What do we do?

37:35.264 --> 37:36.400
I said, proceed!

37:37.601 --> 37:40.838
For once, I agree with Gisborne.

37:59.437 --> 38:02.354
- Hood! Get him!
- Come on, come on!

38:02.721 --> 38:04.560
<i>Isabella!</i>

38:06.018 --> 38:08.360
Didn't think you'd get rid of me
that easily, did you?

38:08.720 --> 38:09.720
No!

38:09.921 --> 38:12.520
I've come to take what's mine.
Your life.

38:12.760 --> 38:15.837
Hey, hey, she doesn't deserve your help.
Come on!

38:20.849 --> 38:22.680
Guy, no!

38:24.876 --> 38:26.336
Are you all right?

38:32.308 --> 38:34.880
We have to do this quickly.
Come on, hurry up!

38:41.450 --> 38:44.624
Did you really think
I'd let you get away with it?

38:46.560 --> 38:49.460
You've betrayed your husband
for the last time!

38:50.681 --> 38:52.563
Isabella!

38:54.825 --> 38:57.069
Hey! Where are you going?
We've got what we came for.

38:57.189 --> 38:59.360
- I have to help her.
- She's your enemy!

38:59.480 --> 39:03.080
Kate. I told him not to come back.
I warned him.

39:03.200 --> 39:04.900
I have to sort this out.

39:05.106 --> 39:07.956
Here, take this. I'll catch you up.
Go on, go!

39:12.942 --> 39:14.701
- No, you don't!
- Don't you dare!

39:14.821 --> 39:16.579
- It's over.
- Just leave me alone!

39:16.699 --> 39:20.694
- You're finished.
- I warn you. Don't come any closer.

39:24.692 --> 39:26.800
You're going to die, Isabella...

39:30.905 --> 39:33.899
- with these.
- No, I beg you, please.

39:36.143 --> 39:39.160
I'll give you everything you want.
Just let me live.

39:40.577 --> 39:41.605
I see now.

39:42.977 --> 39:44.680
I'll be a good wife.

39:45.046 --> 39:47.160
I will show you
the love of a good woman.

39:49.046 --> 39:50.046
Get up.

39:57.361 --> 39:59.360
Stop snivelling, will you?

40:05.611 --> 40:07.121
What have you done?

40:07.321 --> 40:09.080
What I should have done years ago.

40:10.120 --> 40:11.120
Isabella!

40:22.640 --> 40:23.880
Your first murder.

40:24.041 --> 40:26.770
You were supposed to finish him off,
but you weren't man enough.

40:26.890 --> 40:28.672
I only kill
when there's no other way!

40:28.792 --> 40:31.629
You'll get the blame for this
as far as Prince John is concerned.

40:31.749 --> 40:34.899
The murderous Hood still at large,
but not for long.

40:35.810 --> 40:37.280
You listen to me!

40:38.653 --> 40:40.520
We've taken your precious hoard.

40:40.681 --> 40:43.640
And in case you're wondering,
the deal's off.

40:45.511 --> 40:46.552
Let's go.

40:48.623 --> 40:49.623
Come on.

40:54.477 --> 40:56.627
Let's just rest here for a while.

40:58.775 --> 41:00.057
There we go.

41:16.008 --> 41:17.008
Please.

41:36.126 --> 41:38.000
I always quite liked you.

42:11.828 --> 42:13.578
You can say it, you know.

42:14.692 --> 42:16.640
- Say what?
- "Say what?"

42:17.018 --> 42:18.466
You're dying to.

42:20.421 --> 42:21.526
All right.

42:22.918 --> 42:24.080
I told you so!

42:27.216 --> 42:30.200
You finally saw
what sort of a woman she really is.

42:30.559 --> 42:32.032
Yeah, I did.

42:36.166 --> 42:38.566
And I saw
what sort of woman you are.

42:40.280 --> 42:41.545
You're brave

42:42.001 --> 42:43.560
and compassionate

42:44.251 --> 42:45.999
and you're beautiful.

43:01.850 --> 43:04.450
Make sure
all of Thornton's men are dead.

43:04.777 --> 43:08.127
I don't want Prince John
hearing any more lies about me.

43:08.311 --> 43:09.454
See to it.

43:17.080 --> 43:18.598
And next time...

43:20.556 --> 43:21.928
it will be you...

43:23.657 --> 43:24.837
Robin Hood.

43:32.121 --> 43:35.000
I know the truth about how
your parents really died.

43:35.161 --> 43:37.645
Let me go, my father's inside!

43:39.351 --> 43:42.240
There are still things you don't know
about your past.

43:42.576 --> 43:44.560
Robin, you can be the best shot
in England.

43:44.721 --> 43:48.440
- Roger of Gisborne, you are a leper.
- No, don't let them do this.

43:48.601 --> 43:50.960
Guy, act like a man, not a child.

43:51.695 --> 43:53.800
I've been thinking about you
all day.

43:54.613 --> 43:57.600
You expected me to stay away
whilst you stole my wife.
