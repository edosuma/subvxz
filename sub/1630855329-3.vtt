WEBVTT

00:13.247 --> 00:14.682
[Negan] Previously
on Dead City...

00:14.782 --> 00:16.650
For a wanted man,
I look good!

00:16.750 --> 00:18.152
[Armstrong] I'm a
New Babylon marshal.

00:18.252 --> 00:19.653
Have you seen this man?

00:19.753 --> 00:21.189
Manhattan was one
of the epicenters.

00:21.289 --> 00:22.756
Military destroyed all
the bridges and tunnels

00:22.856 --> 00:24.024
hoping to contain it.

00:24.125 --> 00:25.593
[Amaia] What are you after?

00:25.693 --> 00:26.794
It's pretty obvious

00:26.894 --> 00:27.828
you dickheads
ain't from around here.

00:27.928 --> 00:29.530
The Croat, he has my son.

00:29.630 --> 00:31.031
[Amaia] So you wanna
get to the psycho.

00:31.132 --> 00:32.600
That, we can help you with.

00:32.700 --> 00:35.703
[Negan] He was an exceptionally
insane son of a bitch.

00:35.803 --> 00:37.105
I'll put up that girl.

00:37.205 --> 00:39.840
Ginny, I will come
back for you soon.

00:39.940 --> 00:40.974
[crickets chirping]

00:43.577 --> 00:47.981
[birds chirping]

00:54.054 --> 00:57.591
[walker growling]

01:03.297 --> 01:05.166
[grunts]

01:08.336 --> 01:11.004
We gotta talk.
Scratch that,

01:11.105 --> 01:13.039
you gotta talk.

01:13.141 --> 01:14.542
You need help?

01:14.642 --> 01:17.478
How am I supposed to know
if you ain't yelling for it?

01:17.578 --> 01:20.013
All I have been doing for months

01:20.114 --> 01:22.383
is trying to find
a safe place for you,

01:22.483 --> 01:25.553
and you have been sticking
to me like goddamn crazy glue.

01:25.652 --> 01:27.388
I turn my back
for half a second,

01:27.488 --> 01:29.723
and that's when
you decide to skedaddle!?

01:29.823 --> 01:32.960
[birds chirping]

01:42.303 --> 01:43.871
Yeah.

01:43.971 --> 01:46.907
This asswipe tried
to kill us last night.

01:47.007 --> 01:49.443
Guess we ain't the
only ones he pissed off.

01:53.614 --> 01:54.682
Can you at least tell me

01:54.782 --> 01:56.584
what the hell
you're doin' out here?

01:56.684 --> 02:00.154
[birds chirping]

02:05.893 --> 02:09.263
[Negan] You lost your dino.
Goddamn it.

02:09.363 --> 02:11.332
Dropped it, huh?

02:14.668 --> 02:17.605
Okay. All right.

02:17.704 --> 02:21.841
We will just re-goddamn-trace
our goddamn footsteps.

02:22.710 --> 02:28.749
[loud, clunky engine running]

02:32.152 --> 02:34.021
[engine stops running]

02:34.888 --> 02:36.824
[seagulls squawking]
[waves lapping]

02:36.924 --> 02:43.030
[unsettling music]

02:56.744 --> 03:02.716
[music intensifies]

03:08.889 --> 03:14.962
[theme music]

03:58.472 --> 04:03.176
[clacking]

04:11.151 --> 04:12.986
[seagulls squawking]

04:13.086 --> 04:17.858
[clacking continues]

04:30.504 --> 04:32.540
[dings bell]

04:33.841 --> 04:36.744
[Negan laughs]
What do you got there?

04:36.844 --> 04:38.579
It's beeswax.

04:38.679 --> 04:40.648
I hear that's good for cuts.
Can I bum a little bit?

04:41.715 --> 04:43.183
No.

04:43.683 --> 04:45.753
[Amaia] Eighth is safe
until around 30th,

04:45.853 --> 04:47.120
then we'll loop around.

04:47.220 --> 04:48.789
[Tommaso] Might as well
be a map of the moon.

04:48.889 --> 04:50.524
Or Yonkers.

04:50.624 --> 04:52.760
Most of these streets are no-go,

04:52.860 --> 04:54.595
jammed wall-to-wall
with fleshies.

04:54.695 --> 04:56.096
What about 33rd?

04:56.196 --> 04:58.766
[Amaia] Nah, he's got traps
all up and down the 30's.

04:58.866 --> 05:00.834
How long you
guys been at this?

05:02.302 --> 05:05.773
We ain't tourists,
that's for sure.

05:05.873 --> 05:08.642
Just... kids
when it all went down.

05:11.044 --> 05:13.447
The first few weeks
were the worst.

05:13.547 --> 05:15.483
I mean, it spread so fast.

05:15.583 --> 05:18.251
Through the subways,
the buildings.

05:18.352 --> 05:20.421
Bodies coming up
from the ground,

05:20.521 --> 05:22.456
falling from the sky.

05:22.556 --> 05:24.625
[sighs]

05:24.725 --> 05:26.594
We kept waiting for
the Army to show up.

05:26.694 --> 05:29.763
Shit, anybody.

05:29.863 --> 05:32.232
And when they finally got here,

05:32.332 --> 05:36.604
we were dumb enough to think
that they'd come to save us.

05:36.704 --> 05:39.272
Then we watched them
blow up the bridges,

05:39.373 --> 05:41.074
the tunnels.

05:41.174 --> 05:43.644
Leaving us in this death trap.

05:43.744 --> 05:47.180
We were getting it together
little by little,

05:47.280 --> 05:50.451
till he showed up.
Asking people to join him,

05:50.551 --> 05:54.455
offering protection,
creature comforts.

05:54.555 --> 05:56.323
What's he want with you?

05:56.424 --> 05:57.691
To keep us safe.

05:57.791 --> 06:00.027
His paranoid,
crazy version of that.

06:00.127 --> 06:01.762
Kill or be killed.

06:01.862 --> 06:03.631
[Amaia] We were never
gonna sign up for that.

06:03.731 --> 06:06.500
We don't take no orders from
no bridge-and-tunnel nutcase.

06:06.600 --> 06:09.837
[Tommaso] So now
he tries to kill us.

06:09.937 --> 06:11.038
Steal from us.

06:11.138 --> 06:12.372
Catch and torture us,

06:12.473 --> 06:15.543
so he can learn how to
kill and steal some more.

06:15.643 --> 06:19.046
Only one of us
ever got out alive,

06:19.146 --> 06:21.549
and that wasn't
anything but luck.

06:21.649 --> 06:23.584
I've gotta go check the alley.

06:26.787 --> 06:28.522
Oh, shit.

06:28.622 --> 06:29.690
I'm sorry, I didn't mean to--

06:29.790 --> 06:31.792
No, it's all right.

06:31.892 --> 06:33.226
She's tougher than she looks,

06:33.326 --> 06:35.763
and she looks tough as shit.

06:37.465 --> 06:43.571
[tries to breathe down sobs]

06:47.641 --> 06:52.012
[creaking]
[waves lapping]

06:58.185 --> 07:04.291
[tense music]

07:05.358 --> 07:08.295
[seagulls squawking]

07:23.644 --> 07:27.548
[loud whirring]
[walkers growling]

07:27.648 --> 07:29.382
[Tommaso] Wanna
get to the Croat,

07:29.483 --> 07:30.918
we just gotta get through that.

07:31.018 --> 07:33.954
It's been bringing fleshies in
from all over the city.

07:34.054 --> 07:35.789
[Amaia] Right on cue.

07:35.889 --> 07:41.729
[music playing from float]
[walkers growling]

07:46.199 --> 07:48.435
God dang, the parade's lookin'
a little rough this year.

07:48.536 --> 07:49.703
[Maggie] How do we
get inside the arena?

07:49.803 --> 07:52.606
You don't.

07:52.706 --> 07:54.107
-Sewers.
-[Amaia] Hell no.

07:54.207 --> 07:56.409
Army shoved in all
the fleshies they killed

07:56.510 --> 07:58.779
till they got turned
into fleshies too.

07:58.879 --> 08:00.614
Sealed it up nice and tight.

08:00.714 --> 08:03.283
[Negan] You said one
of your people got out.

08:03.383 --> 08:06.954
Look, I'm just extrapolating
here, but...

08:07.054 --> 08:08.622
if someone broke
out of Alcatraz--

08:08.722 --> 08:12.760
Then there's a way back in.
Who escaped?

08:14.595 --> 08:19.299
Tommaso, just tell us
how you got out.

08:19.399 --> 08:21.301
It's all we need to know.

08:21.401 --> 08:24.337
Or... we could show them.

08:24.437 --> 08:26.640
No. The decision's
already been made.

08:26.740 --> 08:28.141
So, what, we're just
gonna sit around,

08:28.241 --> 08:29.476
twiddling our dicks?

08:29.577 --> 08:31.779
He invaded our home!
He butchered our people!

08:31.879 --> 08:33.145
-We can't just--
-Luther's right.

08:33.246 --> 08:35.148
It was a risk when we voted it
down the first time.

08:35.248 --> 08:37.684
And now there's even
less of us, and I...

08:37.784 --> 08:40.320
I don't know if I can...

08:40.419 --> 08:42.690
I mean...

08:42.789 --> 08:44.958
Going back there is, like...

08:45.058 --> 08:48.629
I am, um, getting a
little feeling of déjà vu.

08:49.797 --> 08:52.766
Twelve, fifteen years ago,
there was a...

08:52.866 --> 08:54.868
a fella down south.

08:54.968 --> 08:58.839
Showed up out of nowhere,
a lot like this guy.

08:58.939 --> 09:01.975
Everybody flocked to him because
he knew what they needed,

09:02.075 --> 09:06.279
what they wanted.
Protection.

09:06.379 --> 09:07.948
Sanctuary.

09:08.048 --> 09:10.517
So we built a badass fortress.

09:10.618 --> 09:13.954
Formed an army out of
psychopaths.

09:14.054 --> 09:15.956
And he forced people to join.

09:16.056 --> 09:17.658
And if they didn't?

09:17.758 --> 09:20.193
The hammer came down.

09:20.293 --> 09:23.163
Now soon enough, the people,
they got fed up with it,

09:23.263 --> 09:24.865
so they got together.

09:24.965 --> 09:29.202
And they decided it was time
to take that hammer back.

09:29.302 --> 09:32.806
-So what happened?
-It worked.

09:32.906 --> 09:34.842
Hell yeah it worked.

09:34.942 --> 09:38.111
[whirring in background]

09:42.315 --> 09:43.116
[sighs]

09:45.018 --> 09:48.922
We'll talk to the others.

09:50.323 --> 09:53.627
[tires screeching]

09:55.362 --> 10:03.637
[tense music]

10:33.466 --> 10:35.402
Welcome!

10:37.204 --> 10:43.310
[music grows darker]

11:01.428 --> 11:07.200
[indistinct chatter in distance]

11:08.736 --> 11:09.970
[Tommaso] Sometimes
the door would open

11:10.070 --> 11:13.340
and he'd offer me
food or medicine.

11:13.440 --> 11:16.076
All I had to do
was start talking.

11:16.176 --> 11:19.146
How many of us were left,
where we were hiding.

11:19.246 --> 11:20.613
[chuckles]

11:20.714 --> 11:23.583
But I knew the second
I talked, I'd be axed, so...

11:23.683 --> 11:27.154
you know, the door kept opening.

11:27.254 --> 11:29.723
But let's just say there was
no more food and medicine.

11:31.091 --> 11:32.960
When I was a kid,

11:33.060 --> 11:34.828
my nonno used to talk
about working on the crew

11:34.928 --> 11:36.496
that rebuilt Penn Station.

11:36.596 --> 11:39.165
People assumed the
old station was gone.

11:39.266 --> 11:42.803
But Gramps, he knew the spots
where they left the framework

11:42.903 --> 11:45.973
hiding behind the walls.

11:46.073 --> 11:47.374
So one night, the Burazi

11:47.474 --> 11:49.977
were kind enough
to clean out my cell

11:50.077 --> 11:52.012
from all the blood
they spilt in there.

11:52.112 --> 11:55.182
And lucky for me,
a fleshie got in.

11:55.282 --> 11:57.517
I ran as fast as I could,

11:57.617 --> 12:01.822
followed the framework,
found the tunnels.

12:01.922 --> 12:04.992
So how far are
the cells once we get in?

12:05.092 --> 12:06.359
It's close.

12:06.459 --> 12:07.494
[taps table twice]

12:07.594 --> 12:09.396
Wouldn't bank on
those cells being full.

12:09.496 --> 12:10.697
After your disappearing act,

12:10.798 --> 12:12.499
he would've moved folks
off site.

12:12.599 --> 12:14.067
How do you know?

12:15.468 --> 12:17.070
It's what he would've done.

12:19.639 --> 12:21.374
He and the Croat
know each other.

12:21.474 --> 12:24.711
They go back. Way back.

12:24.812 --> 12:28.581
He knows how he thinks.

12:30.117 --> 12:31.518
Huh.

12:31.618 --> 12:32.719
So they buddies, then?

12:32.820 --> 12:37.390
Were. Took a shot at him.
Blew his ear off.

12:37.490 --> 12:41.361
He can bait him.
Lure him out of the arena.

12:41.461 --> 12:45.032
And we get him to tell me
where my son is.

12:45.132 --> 12:47.600
And we kill him.

12:47.700 --> 12:49.402
The rest of us
will get a jump on his people

12:49.502 --> 12:51.004
so he can't follow you.

12:51.104 --> 12:52.105
[Luther] I'm sorry.

12:52.205 --> 12:54.607
You said he shot
his ear off, right?

12:54.707 --> 12:56.043
So how is he gonna bait him?

12:56.143 --> 12:58.411
You don't think
he's gonna want payback?

12:58.511 --> 13:01.581
Eye for an eye?
Dick for an ear?

13:01.681 --> 13:04.117
And what if you're wrong?

13:04.217 --> 13:05.252
What if it doesn't work?

13:05.352 --> 13:06.419
It will work.

13:06.519 --> 13:09.222
Y'all gonna get us killed.
And for what?

13:09.322 --> 13:11.091
For my son.

13:11.191 --> 13:12.425
So that I can get my son.

13:12.525 --> 13:15.395
Your son is already dead!

13:15.495 --> 13:16.930
I think you know that.

13:17.030 --> 13:18.798
[Negan] All right,
you know what?

13:18.899 --> 13:22.502
It's been a long day.
Let's take five.

13:23.703 --> 13:25.906
[indistinct chatter]

13:37.184 --> 13:42.923
[loud whirring]

13:43.023 --> 13:46.259
[keys jangling]
[door unlocking]

13:49.729 --> 13:51.498
[door shuts]

14:06.713 --> 14:12.785
[soothing Croatian choir music,
Proplakat Ce Zora , plays]

14:12.886 --> 14:14.354
[door opens]

14:18.425 --> 14:19.859
[door shuts]

14:21.094 --> 14:22.629
[sighs]

14:24.764 --> 14:26.366
Chilly in here,
isn't it?

14:30.770 --> 14:31.838
[switches on heat]

14:31.939 --> 14:34.707
[The Croat] There we are!

14:36.409 --> 14:39.346
Not bad for a jail, no?

14:39.446 --> 14:41.081
[chuckles]

14:47.454 --> 14:49.589
Nicer than yours, I imagine.

14:50.590 --> 14:51.992
Lights.

14:52.092 --> 14:54.527
Heat, music.

14:54.627 --> 14:55.695
Drink.

14:55.795 --> 14:57.664
Food.

15:01.834 --> 15:03.770
You must be hungry.

15:06.806 --> 15:08.608
Pasticada.

15:14.982 --> 15:17.517
It isn't magic, I promise.

15:19.953 --> 15:22.722
Only science.

15:22.822 --> 15:26.893
That was my profession.
Alternative energy.

15:26.994 --> 15:31.398
So naturally,
when I first arrived here,

15:31.498 --> 15:33.100
I couldn't
help asking myself,

15:33.200 --> 15:37.570
what is the most abundant
natural resource

15:37.670 --> 15:39.139
on this island?

15:42.309 --> 15:43.543
Death.

15:43.643 --> 15:45.245
The sewers are full of it.

15:45.345 --> 15:47.580
As the bodies break down,
they produce methane,

15:47.680 --> 15:50.783
and because the intermolecular
forces are weak,

15:50.883 --> 15:56.223
the gas can be pressurized
into a liquid fuel

15:56.323 --> 15:58.891
at regular temperatures.

16:00.327 --> 16:02.329
Amazing, isn't it?

16:03.896 --> 16:09.302
What we have built here
is a sanctuary.

16:15.242 --> 16:17.410
And all are welcome.

16:23.050 --> 16:26.553
So, why are you here,

16:26.653 --> 16:29.189
and whom did you bring with you?

16:31.058 --> 16:32.759
[sighs]

16:34.661 --> 16:35.928
[silverware clanking]

16:36.029 --> 16:40.467
You understand,
I can't offer you refuge

16:40.567 --> 16:42.535
until you no longer
pose a threat.

16:44.904 --> 16:46.639
Because above all, above all

16:46.739 --> 16:50.310
in this vicious, monstrous
world,

16:50.410 --> 16:53.513
we must stay safe.

16:57.950 --> 17:03.490
[record crackles, skips]

17:03.590 --> 17:05.525
You inspected the meat?

17:08.194 --> 17:13.133
Rotten meat can host
all type of bacteria.

17:13.233 --> 17:16.002
And without the treatment
that we once had,

17:16.103 --> 17:18.137
all potentially deadly.

17:21.441 --> 17:25.512
Why would you serve me
rotten meat?

17:25.612 --> 17:27.646
-Actually, it was--
-Ah, ah!

17:27.747 --> 17:33.753
[tense, sinister music]

17:51.671 --> 17:53.106
Ahh.

17:54.006 --> 17:55.508
Ahh?

18:02.482 --> 18:04.784
[gulps]

18:10.657 --> 18:12.259
[crack]

18:18.831 --> 18:22.101

18:28.875 --> 18:33.880
[tense, sinister music]

18:33.980 --> 18:35.148
[door opens]

18:39.152 --> 18:42.822
[walkers growling]

18:59.572 --> 19:05.678
[dark, wistful music]

19:39.612 --> 19:41.180
[Negan coughs]

19:42.249 --> 19:44.851
Hey, sorry. I, um...

19:51.424 --> 19:53.660
I found this in the back of
one of those tourist shops.

19:53.760 --> 19:56.496
I remember, uh...

19:56.596 --> 19:59.599
I remember Hershel used to
wear one sort of like it.

19:59.699 --> 20:02.068
Thought maybe you could give
it to him when you see him.

20:04.771 --> 20:07.974
He's wrong, Luther.
He is wrong.

20:08.074 --> 20:09.842
Your plan is gonna work.

20:09.942 --> 20:12.545
If you wanna talk about it
or whatever, I...

20:13.246 --> 20:18.451
Contrary to popular belief,
I do occasionally...

20:18.551 --> 20:20.420
know how to shut up.

20:35.134 --> 20:37.236
[chairs creaks]

20:39.806 --> 20:42.775
When the Croat
showed up at our gates...

20:44.744 --> 20:48.748
I told Hershel...
to get in the root cellar.

20:51.518 --> 20:53.486
I tried to make him hide.

20:53.586 --> 20:55.221
By then, I could've said left
and he'd go right

20:55.322 --> 20:57.324
just to spite me.

20:57.424 --> 20:58.891
And he went and grabbed
his shovel and a brick

20:58.991 --> 21:01.193
like that was gonna do anything.

21:03.162 --> 21:05.131
And I told him he was stupid.

21:06.999 --> 21:09.369
He told me to get off
his damn back for once.

21:14.507 --> 21:16.876
And that is the last thing
that we said to each other.

21:17.777 --> 21:21.548
And I screwed up
so many ways before then.

21:21.648 --> 21:24.451
Fumbling through,
doing it by ourself...

21:29.188 --> 21:30.390
There weren't a lot of people

21:30.490 --> 21:34.293
that meant anything
to me in this world.

21:34.394 --> 21:38.431
But there were enough.

21:38.531 --> 21:42.134
And whatever's left of all
of them is inside this box.

21:45.037 --> 21:47.006
And I'm...

21:51.911 --> 21:53.913
A few years ago,

21:54.013 --> 21:55.448
Joshua, Annie, and I,

21:55.548 --> 21:58.585
we were living in this little
cabin outside of New Babylon.

22:00.219 --> 22:01.788
One day, Annie decided
to go into town

22:01.888 --> 22:03.690
to do some trading.

22:06.225 --> 22:09.228
When she wasn't home
at nightfall, I, uh...

22:09.328 --> 22:12.331
I knew something had gone wrong.

22:12.432 --> 22:16.636
I went looking for her.
I found her.

22:16.736 --> 22:18.705
And she had been...

22:21.073 --> 22:22.274
[sighs]

22:22.375 --> 22:23.510
She had been--

22:23.610 --> 22:27.714
She had been robbed,
beaten, and, um...

22:30.116 --> 22:33.820
She begged me not to
do something stupid.

22:33.920 --> 22:37.390
The hell, you know me.
I found 'em.

22:38.625 --> 22:40.960
All five of 'em.

22:41.060 --> 22:43.896
Some shit drinking hole.

22:45.765 --> 22:49.001
Honestly, I don't think I
even wanted to kill 'em.

22:49.101 --> 22:53.005
After that, we were on the run,
and it was very hard for Annie.

22:53.105 --> 22:54.841
So I put 'em on a wagon train
to Missouri,

22:54.941 --> 22:57.143
and I said I'd be
right behind 'em.

22:59.245 --> 23:01.213
I stayed.

23:01.313 --> 23:04.350
I think about them
every single day.

23:04.451 --> 23:06.352
I hope to god they are okay,

23:06.453 --> 23:09.255
and maybe I have no right
in hoping that.

23:11.157 --> 23:12.992
I don't know, Maggie.

23:14.827 --> 23:17.697
I mean, what else do we have?

23:17.797 --> 23:19.265
Besides hope.

23:23.503 --> 23:25.705
[Negan sighs]

23:25.805 --> 23:27.607
I thought you knew
how to shut up.

23:59.606 --> 24:01.207
[Negan] We can't
keep doing this.

24:01.307 --> 24:06.779
Been lookin' for this
friggin' dinosaur all day.

24:06.879 --> 24:11.618
[sighs] I've gotta find
a better place for you.

24:11.718 --> 24:15.254
And you have to speak.

24:15.354 --> 24:17.924
You know, I call out
for you, then you...

24:18.024 --> 24:19.692
you call back, all right?

24:19.792 --> 24:22.862
You're in trouble, you say so.

24:22.962 --> 24:26.733
Hey! Are you listening to me?

24:26.833 --> 24:30.102
No, Ginny,
you don't get to say no.

24:30.202 --> 24:31.904
All right, maybe back in the day

24:32.004 --> 24:33.806
you could go see
some state doctor

24:33.906 --> 24:36.275
and he would help you get
through all the horrible shit

24:36.375 --> 24:38.410
you've been through.

24:38.511 --> 24:40.479
But that is not
the case anymore,

24:40.580 --> 24:42.448
so you gotta skip
all the coping shit

24:42.549 --> 24:46.986
and get straight to
the staying alive shit.

24:47.086 --> 24:50.757
You hear me?

24:50.857 --> 24:52.525
Do you hear me!?

24:56.896 --> 24:58.631
[sighs]

24:58.731 --> 25:04.336
[birds chirping]

25:12.278 --> 25:13.780
Hey.

25:16.749 --> 25:18.918
You know what the problem is?

25:19.018 --> 25:20.987
The problem is
we don't have any leads.

25:21.087 --> 25:24.991
Or hell, maybe the
leads are all around us

25:25.091 --> 25:27.359
and we can't just see 'em.

Tonight...

27:59.411 --> 28:02.815
we celebrate
our fallen brother.

28:02.915 --> 28:06.452
Not mourn, no.

28:06.552 --> 28:09.822
Because death is no end.

28:09.922 --> 28:12.992
It is our fuel.

are a resource!

32:47.866 --> 32:49.568
I gotta say,

32:49.668 --> 32:51.070
I'm shitting more bricks

32:51.170 --> 32:53.505
than what's left in
the city right now.

32:55.874 --> 32:57.809
I don't know how you do it.

32:57.909 --> 33:00.412
Keep it together,
with your kid and all.

33:04.050 --> 33:09.688
Amaia, she says having a kid
in the city wouldn't be safe.

33:11.257 --> 33:13.092
Yeah, I don't know, I just...

33:14.893 --> 33:16.862
Yeah, she's probably right,
you know?

33:19.031 --> 33:20.832
Yeah, she's right.

33:22.434 --> 33:24.503
It isn't safe.

33:28.407 --> 33:30.542
So you have to
make it safe somehow.

33:33.445 --> 33:35.681
You do whatever it takes.

33:36.115 --> 33:38.317
[Amaia] Tommaso!

Look who's here.

-Aw, shh.

33:49.561 --> 33:50.962

33:55.067 --> 33:56.968
Um...

Where'd you get that?

Street.

34:09.947 --> 34:11.483
When?

34:13.219 --> 34:15.754
I know a little girl who likes
stuff like that, that's all.

34:20.458 --> 34:22.094
Take it.

34:26.931 --> 34:31.570
[loud whirring]
[walkers growling]

34:34.639 --> 34:39.678
That was the best show
this place has seen in years.

34:42.148 --> 34:46.952
I don't enjoy such barbarism,
but it had to be done.

34:49.987 --> 34:55.761
When the world became unstable,

34:55.860 --> 34:59.765
my family and I found
shelter in a post office.

34:59.865 --> 35:03.869
We were starving,
so I went to look for food.

35:03.969 --> 35:09.275
When I got back,
I smelled it immediately.

35:09.375 --> 35:11.910

35:12.010 --> 35:15.714

35:15.814 --> 35:17.749
and my daughters Nika and Hana,

35:17.849 --> 35:21.920
and my son, Filip,

35:22.020 --> 35:24.923
had become a meal

35:25.023 --> 35:27.493
for another starving family.

35:29.161 --> 35:32.097
I was too distraught to
even think of killing myself,

35:32.198 --> 35:36.067
and by the time that
would've occurred to me,

35:36.168 --> 35:41.940
I had already found the man
who would become my new family

35:42.040 --> 35:46.445
and teach me how to protect
the things that matter,

35:46.545 --> 35:51.583
which makes me wonder
what it is you are protecting

35:51.683 --> 35:53.084
in that boot.

37:22.308 --> 37:24.676
His name is Negan.

37:31.817 --> 37:35.787
[clanking]

37:46.332 --> 37:48.634
[chuckles]

37:51.537 --> 37:54.340
Oh dang, for a big guy,
you are quiet.

37:54.440 --> 37:56.608
I just, you know,
seeing if there's any weapons

37:56.708 --> 37:58.477
I could pick up for tomorrow.

38:01.112 --> 38:03.014
Look,

38:03.114 --> 38:06.385
I know you're not the
president of my fan club.

38:06.485 --> 38:08.253
I get it, but all
you need to know is that

38:08.354 --> 38:10.589
we are on the same side
and this plan is gonna work.

38:10.689 --> 38:14.259
The two of you are
leaving here tonight.

38:14.360 --> 38:17.228
I think you got the
wrong idea about me.

38:17.329 --> 38:19.164
Do I?

38:23.535 --> 38:26.171
So this isn't you right here?

38:27.506 --> 38:29.541
Says that "if you have
any information on this man,

38:29.641 --> 38:32.644
"notify any office of
the New Babylon Marshals.

38:32.744 --> 38:34.680
Do not approach unless armed."

38:35.747 --> 38:36.915
Mm.

38:37.015 --> 38:38.283
Where, uh,
where'd you get that?

38:38.384 --> 38:40.085
I got it from you.

38:40.185 --> 38:42.187
Must've been proud of yourself
to keep it on you.

38:44.089 --> 38:47.225
"Antisocial, prone
to extreme violence,

38:47.325 --> 38:50.662
"with above-average
intelligence and charisma.

38:50.762 --> 38:52.431
Do not trust him."

38:55.567 --> 38:58.470
The thing is...

38:58.570 --> 39:02.140
that I have people
depending on me, Luther.

39:02.240 --> 39:04.810
So respectfully?

39:04.910 --> 39:06.144
No.

39:06.244 --> 39:09.347
I ain't goin' anywhere.

39:10.549 --> 39:12.684
Respectfully,

39:12.784 --> 39:15.286
people are depending
on me as well.

39:15.387 --> 39:17.889
So, you know.

39:18.957 --> 39:25.030
[tense music]

39:26.432 --> 39:29.535
[chuckles]

39:29.635 --> 39:30.536
All right, here's the deal.

39:30.636 --> 39:32.671
I am, uh...

39:32.771 --> 39:35.373
I'ma try this one more time.

39:35.474 --> 39:36.842
All right, Luther?

39:36.942 --> 39:38.877
And I really hope this
doesn't turn into something

39:38.977 --> 39:41.079
it doesn't need to.

39:51.957 --> 39:53.759
Okay.

39:54.593 --> 39:57.362
[music intensifies]

[tense music]

41:17.308 --> 41:18.610
You didn't, by chance,

41:18.710 --> 41:20.679
check your bag before we left
this morning, did you?

41:25.984 --> 41:28.620
Maybe you didn't drop it all.
Maybe that asswipe stole him

41:28.720 --> 41:31.422
before you even had
a chance to drop him.

41:31.523 --> 41:37.362
[insects buzzing]

41:47.539 --> 41:49.775
[Negan] Oh shit, hold up.

41:49.875 --> 41:52.711
Oh, [grunts]

41:55.080 --> 41:57.215
All right, hold on to it for me.

41:58.516 --> 42:00.485
Good.

42:00.586 --> 42:04.656
Very gentle, go around.

42:04.756 --> 42:07.993
And... here you go, ma'am.

42:08.093 --> 42:10.696
the operation was
a complete success.

42:14.232 --> 42:16.668
All right.
Here's the thing, Ginny.

42:16.768 --> 42:20.171
I want you to listen, okay?

42:20.271 --> 42:22.874
[whistles two tones]

42:22.974 --> 42:26.712
That was the whistle that my
wife Lucille used, all right?

42:26.812 --> 42:28.847
She was sick and
couldn't get out of bed,

42:28.947 --> 42:30.181
and she would do that whistle.

42:30.281 --> 42:33.685
And it didn't matter what
I was doing or where I was.

42:33.785 --> 42:35.320
I came running.

42:36.287 --> 42:39.224
[whistles two tones]
Can you do that?

42:39.324 --> 42:40.525
[whistles two tones]

42:40.626 --> 42:41.960
[Negan] That was amazing.

42:42.060 --> 42:46.698
You do that and I'm not
around, I will be there.

42:46.798 --> 42:48.700
Deal?

42:48.800 --> 42:50.869
Talk is cheap anyway, kid.

42:50.969 --> 42:53.038
Believe me, I oughta know.

42:53.138 --> 42:54.940
It doesn't matter
what people say.

42:56.241 --> 43:00.679
[folksy guitar]

43:00.779 --> 43:04.582
* Hang me, oh, hang me

43:04.683 --> 43:07.085
* I'll be dead and gone

43:07.185 --> 43:08.720
It only matters what they do.

43:08.820 --> 43:12.423
* Hang me, oh, hang me

43:12.523 --> 43:16.561
* I'll be dead and gone

43:16.662 --> 43:19.898
* Wouldn't mind the hanging

43:19.998 --> 43:23.869
* But the laying in the
grave so long, poor boy *

43:23.969 --> 43:28.473
* I've been all
around this world *

43:30.608 --> 43:34.112
* Hang me, oh, hang me

43:34.212 --> 43:38.083
* I'll be dead and gone

43:38.183 --> 43:41.552
* Wouldn't mind the hanging

43:41.653 --> 43:45.724
* But the laying in the
grave so long, poor boy *

43:45.824 --> 43:50.328
* I've been all
around this world *

43:54.132 --> 43:57.202
Negan:
It's gonna work, Maggie.

43:57.302 --> 43:59.604
We're gonna get your boy back.

43:59.705 --> 44:04.109
Woman: You get your kid.
We kill the psycho.

44:04.209 --> 44:05.777
Don't screw it up.

44:05.877 --> 44:07.412
*

44:07.512 --> 44:08.446
[Woman screams]

44:08.546 --> 44:09.781
Hey, follow me!

44:09.881 --> 44:11.616
Negan?

44:11.717 --> 44:13.251
Fall in!

44:13.351 --> 44:15.286
*

44:15.386 --> 44:18.489
Nothing to be afraid of.
It's only me.

44:25.230 --> 44:27.933
Eli: Hi, I'm Eli Jorné,
EP showrunner of "Dead City,"

44:28.033 --> 44:32.403
and this is episode three,
"People are a Resource."

44:32.503 --> 44:35.841
*

44:35.941 --> 44:39.110
So, episode three has
this flashback storyline

44:39.210 --> 44:40.445
about Ginny and Negan,

44:40.545 --> 44:43.414
and we learn how
they formed their bond.

44:43.514 --> 44:47.252
Negan: You lost your Dino,
God damn it.

44:47.352 --> 44:52.090
*

44:52.190 --> 44:55.160
I think there's something
in Negan that wants to be there

44:55.260 --> 44:57.262
for people,
that can be there for people.

44:57.362 --> 44:58.964
[Whistles]

44:59.064 --> 45:00.431
Can you do that?

45:00.531 --> 45:02.000
[Whistles]

45:02.100 --> 45:03.802
That was amazing.

45:05.036 --> 45:07.472
The flashback is there
to help tell that story, too,

45:07.572 --> 45:09.640
about how Ginny
makes her way to the city.

45:09.741 --> 45:12.177
Well, she did it because
she's got Negan in her head.

45:12.277 --> 45:14.045
And so in that way,
we start to understand

45:14.145 --> 45:16.982
that it isn't just that he
helped her find a dinosaur doll,

45:17.082 --> 45:19.851
you know, he helped
her figure out how to live.

45:19.951 --> 45:21.853
*

45:21.953 --> 45:25.023
So in episode three,
we have yet another scene

45:25.123 --> 45:26.491
of Negan killing somebody.

45:26.591 --> 45:29.027
All you need to know
is that we are on the same side,

45:29.127 --> 45:30.528
and this plan is gonna --
The two of you

45:30.628 --> 45:33.231
are leaving here tonight.

45:33.331 --> 45:34.565
There's a lot
of implications there

45:34.665 --> 45:36.201
that Luther
intends to do to Negan

45:36.301 --> 45:38.169
what Negan ends up
doing to him.

45:38.269 --> 45:39.637
Everything that Luther is doing

45:39.737 --> 45:42.507
is coming from a place of love
for his people.

45:42.607 --> 45:44.742
And I think there's something
in Negan that even knows that.

45:44.843 --> 45:46.845
Okay.
[Clink]

45:46.945 --> 45:48.379
[Grunts]
[Pan clatters]

45:48.479 --> 45:51.016
We see that moment when Negan
holds down Luther's head,

45:51.116 --> 45:54.252
and there's a look in his face
like there's something in him

45:54.352 --> 45:56.354
that kind of gets unleashed
a little bit there,

45:56.454 --> 45:58.189
and he knows it
and maybe he fears it.

45:58.289 --> 45:59.657
And it's just
a small, little moment,

45:59.757 --> 46:01.359
but he looks down at his hand,

46:01.459 --> 46:03.528
and it's this wound
that got opened up.

46:03.628 --> 46:06.364
It's like these sort of
monstrous forces in him

46:06.464 --> 46:09.734
that seem to come out
whether he likes it or not.

46:09.835 --> 46:12.003
*

46:12.103 --> 46:15.340
The Croat and the Boratzi
are holed up in this big arena.

46:15.440 --> 46:17.508
That was really fun to build.

46:17.608 --> 46:19.210
The production designer,
Scott Murphy,

46:19.310 --> 46:21.179
just did
an incredible job there.

46:21.279 --> 46:22.447
There were these suites
all around,

46:22.547 --> 46:24.549
and those were our offices.

46:24.649 --> 46:26.517
So I'd be sitting there
doing rewrites,

46:26.617 --> 46:28.753
and I'd hear crazy stuff
happening down below --

46:28.854 --> 46:31.722
screaming and walkers
and groans and whatnot.

46:31.823 --> 46:33.358
The Croat: Here we are.

46:33.458 --> 46:36.427
*

46:36.527 --> 46:39.931
Not bad for a jail, no?
[Chuckles]

46:40.031 --> 46:41.933
The Croat never does anything
just to do it,

46:42.033 --> 46:43.101
just to be nice.

46:43.201 --> 46:44.535
There's always strategy there.

46:44.635 --> 46:46.905
And in this case,
he's trying to say to Armstrong,

46:47.005 --> 46:50.608
"If you give me what I want,
you can become a part of this."

46:50.708 --> 46:52.477
But I think Armstrong
knows on some level

46:52.577 --> 46:54.612
that's a dangerous game
to be playing.

46:54.712 --> 46:57.082
And so he withholds
the information,

46:57.182 --> 47:00.585
and of course, that leads
to a lot of trouble for him.

47:00.685 --> 47:04.755
[Crowd chanting indistinctly,
cheers]

47:04.856 --> 47:06.791
*

47:06.892 --> 47:08.927
Methane, you know,
if you breathe it in,

47:09.027 --> 47:13.598
it can really just kind of slow
everything down and mess you up.

47:13.698 --> 47:15.300
[Walker growls]

47:15.400 --> 47:16.968
There's this key moment --

47:17.068 --> 47:21.940
Armstrong realizes he could get
the key out of his stomach.

47:22.040 --> 47:23.674
And that's when I think we start
to realize

47:23.774 --> 47:26.577
this is weirdly a kind of test
or a challenge

47:26.677 --> 47:29.847
to see what Armstrong's made of.

47:29.948 --> 47:31.582
And then there's
this second key moment,

47:31.682 --> 47:34.619
which is when Armstrong
reaches to get his boot.

47:34.719 --> 47:35.954
And that's what
it was all about.

47:36.054 --> 47:37.622
The Croat has put him
in this situation

47:37.722 --> 47:40.425
where his life is on the line
and something slips out.

47:40.525 --> 47:43.494
The thing that's going to
crack him and break him.

47:43.594 --> 47:48.699
*

47:48.799 --> 47:51.169
Through the tribes people
and their experiences,

47:51.269 --> 47:54.505
their ways of grieving,
it's gonna start to kind of

47:54.605 --> 47:56.841
crack Maggie and Negan
open a bit.

47:56.942 --> 47:58.643
Maggie: There weren't
a lot of people

47:58.743 --> 48:01.446
that meant anything to me
in this world,

48:01.546 --> 48:03.448
but there were enough.

48:03.548 --> 48:05.150
*

48:05.250 --> 48:09.387
And whatever's left of
all of them is inside this box.

48:09.487 --> 48:11.489
And Negan, too,
is gonna have to open up

48:11.589 --> 48:13.524
and be vulnerable about
his pushing his family away

48:13.624 --> 48:14.825
to save them the trouble.

48:14.926 --> 48:16.227
Negan: After that,
we were on the run,

48:16.327 --> 48:18.863
and it was
very hard for Annie.

48:18.964 --> 48:20.865
So I put him on
a wagon train to Missouri,

48:20.966 --> 48:23.501
and I said I'd be
right behind him.

48:25.470 --> 48:26.504
I stayed.

48:26.604 --> 48:28.206
And when they start to do that,

48:28.306 --> 48:31.476
the funny thing that starts to
happen is they start to connect.

48:31.576 --> 48:32.743
You know, maybe on some level,

48:32.843 --> 48:34.379
they're both
starting to understand

48:34.479 --> 48:36.414
that the only way out of this
is through each other.

48:36.514 --> 48:38.183
I don't know, Maggie.

48:38.283 --> 48:40.018
*

48:40.118 --> 48:42.853
Hey, what else do we have

48:42.954 --> 48:44.489
besides hope?

48:44.589 --> 48:50.561
