01:05.543 --> 01:06.892
WOULDN'T THAT
BE MY FAIR LADY?

01:06.892 --> 01:09.939
UH, IT WOULD BE IF WE
COULD AFFORD THE RIGHTS.

01:09.939 --> 01:11.027
BUT THE WHOLE THING
IS FOR CHARITY.

01:11.027 --> 01:12.202
WE DONATE THE TICKET SALES

01:12.202 --> 01:13.638

01:15.031 --> 01:16.641
HAD TO WRITE OUR OWN SONGS.

01:16.641 --> 01:18.774

02:43.467 --> 02:44.990
YOU'RE GONNA BE ABLE TO
SIT ON IT, AREN'T YOU?

02:49.473 --> 02:50.344
OH, MAN.

02:52.520 --> 02:53.608
MAN, THAT--

02:53.608 --> 02:54.609
THAT'LL TEACH YOU

02:54.609 --> 02:57.351
NOT TO ASK ME
WHAT'S NEW.

02:57.351 --> 02:59.483
IS IT ALL RIGHT
FOR ME TO HATE HIM?

02:59.483 --> 03:01.093
I MEAN,
IS THAT ACCEPTABLE?

03:01.093 --> 03:02.921
NO, DON'T HATE HIM.

03:02.921 --> 03:03.835
I DON'T HATE HIM.

03:05.141 --> 03:07.143
LOOK, YOU WEREN'T HERE.

03:07.143 --> 03:09.232
SO THEY LET YOU OUT
WITHOUT ANY FINALS?

03:09.232 --> 03:11.060
YOU JUST HAVE 2 MORE
PAPERS TO WRITE?

03:11.060 --> 03:12.366
NO, NO.
WAIT A MINUTE.

03:12.366 --> 03:13.367
THAT'S--

03:13.367 --> 03:15.238
FORGET ABOUT
THAT STUFF.

03:15.238 --> 03:16.021
WE'RE TALKING
ABOUT YOU.

03:16.021 --> 03:18.589
I MEAN,
WHY IS THIS OK?

03:18.589 --> 03:20.417
WHY IS WHAT HE DID
ACCEPTABLE?

03:20.417 --> 03:22.114
IT'S NOT.

03:22.114 --> 03:24.595
I DIDN'T SAY THAT.

03:24.595 --> 03:27.032
BUT I DID STUFF
TO HIM, TOO.

03:27.032 --> 03:28.033
YEAH.

03:29.165 --> 03:31.123
LOOK, WE'RE TRYING.

03:31.123 --> 03:32.603
I LOVE HIM,

03:32.603 --> 03:34.518
AND I THINK HE
STILL LOVES ME,

03:34.518 --> 03:35.954
AND WE'RE TRYING
TO FIND SOME WAY

03:35.954 --> 03:37.129
TO MAKE THINGS
NORMAL AGAIN.

03:38.392 --> 03:40.742
BUT I CAN'T, UH,

03:40.742 --> 03:42.309
I CAN'T LISTEN TO YOU

03:42.309 --> 03:44.049
SAY BAD THINGS
ABOUT HIM, OK?

03:44.049 --> 03:46.008
YEAH. OK.

03:46.008 --> 03:46.922
UM...

03:48.837 --> 03:49.838
I HAVE AN IDEA.

03:49.838 --> 03:50.882
MM-HMM?

03:50.882 --> 03:51.883
IT DOESN'T INVOLVE

03:51.883 --> 03:53.494
EITHER OF US
TALKING.

03:53.494 --> 03:54.799
NOT THAT MUCH.

03:54.799 --> 03:56.279
UM...

03:56.279 --> 03:58.063
WHY DON'T WE
SLEEP TOGETHER?

04:00.762 --> 04:01.806
WHAT?

04:01.806 --> 04:03.852
YEAH. THAT WAY
BOTH OF YOU

04:03.852 --> 04:05.984

SCRIPT THING.

05:24.976 --> 05:26.282
I DON'T KNOW.

05:30.330 --> 05:32.462
IS THIS CONVERSATION
AS DUMB AS IT SOUNDS?

05:33.985 --> 05:36.161
I JUST--
I DON'T KNOW IF I SHOULD

05:36.161 --> 05:39.164
ASK YOU ABOUT STUFF
THAT WENT ON THERE,

05:39.164 --> 05:41.732
OR IF YOU WANT
TO TALK ABOUT THAT?

05:41.732 --> 05:42.777
NOT YET.

05:42.777 --> 05:46.041
IT--IT'S JUST...

05:46.041 --> 05:48.304
I WANT TO TAKE
THINGS SLOW.

05:48.304 --> 05:49.958
RIGHT NOW.

05:55.093 --> 05:56.573
BUT, UM...

05:58.140 --> 06:00.534
YOU COULD KISS ME.

06:00.534 --> 06:01.622
YEAH?

06:04.886 --> 06:06.322
'CAUSE I'D LIKE THAT.

06:25.297 --> 06:26.690

06:26.690 --> 06:28.953

06:28.953 --> 06:31.129
I MISSED YOU.

06:31.129 --> 06:32.043
ME, TOO.

06:33.958 --> 06:37.266
Daphne: YOU HAVE TO.
YOU HAVE TO DO THIS.

06:37.266 --> 06:39.181
ALL I SAID I'D DO
IS PAINT SETS.

06:39.181 --> 06:40.356
DO YOU NOT
UNDERSTAND?

06:40.356 --> 06:41.357
WE GO UP IN 2 DAYS,

06:41.357 --> 06:43.011
AND I JUST LOST
MY LEAD.

06:43.011 --> 06:44.665
I'M SORRY, DAPHNE.

06:44.665 --> 06:45.927
I'M DOING
SMURFS ON ICE.

06:45.927 --> 06:47.407
I'M PAPA SMURF.

06:47.407 --> 06:49.191
YOU SHOULD HAVE HAD
AN UNDERSTUDY.

06:49.191 --> 06:51.106
I'M AN OPTIMIST,
CHARLIE.

06:51.106 --> 06:53.848
COME ON!
YOU KNOW THE PLAY.

06:53.848 --> 06:54.892
I KNOW YOU KNOW IT.

06:54.892 --> 06:57.112
I'M DOING
ALL THIS JOB STUFF NOW.

06:57.112 --> 06:58.156
I HAVE TO FOCUS ON THAT.

06:58.156 --> 06:59.288
I DON'T HAVE TIME
TO REHEARSE.

06:59.288 --> 07:00.507
OH, YEAH, YEAH.

07:00.507 --> 07:02.509
TAP-DANCING FOR SOME
HEADS OF PERSONNEL.

07:02.509 --> 07:04.032
BOY, THAT'S FUN.

07:04.032 --> 07:05.294
THAT'S HOW
TO LIVE IT UP.

07:09.820 --> 07:11.039
DAPHNE.

07:11.039 --> 07:12.040
GREAT.

07:12.040 --> 07:13.084
THEN I'LL JUST--

07:13.084 --> 07:15.870
I'LL JUST CALL
THE FOUNDATION

07:15.870 --> 07:18.350
AND TELL THEM THAT WE
WON'T BE CONTRIBUTING
ANYTHING

07:18.350 --> 07:20.004
BECAUSE
WE HAD TO CANCEL,

07:20.004 --> 07:21.484
BECAUSE OUR
HENRY HIGGINS

07:21.484 --> 07:23.312
IS SKATING AROUND
THE COW PALACE

07:23.312 --> 07:25.009
IN A ROYAL BLUE
ONESIE.

07:25.009 --> 07:26.054
[SIGHS]

07:26.054 --> 07:27.577
YOU DON'T HAVE
ANYBODY ELSE?

07:27.577 --> 07:29.492
I MEAN, MAYBE SOMEBODY
THAT'S DONE THIS BEFORE,

07:29.492 --> 07:31.668
ONE OF THE GUYS
IN THE CHORUS?

07:34.628 --> 07:35.759
WHY...

07:35.759 --> 07:37.979
WOULD I SETTLE

07:37.979 --> 07:41.722
FOR A CUBIC
ZIRCONIUM...

07:41.722 --> 07:45.116
WHEN THERE IS
A BIG, SHINY,

07:45.116 --> 07:49.381
SEXY DIAMOND
STANDING RIGHT
IN FRONT OF ME?

07:49.381 --> 07:51.427
MAN, IS IT SNOWING
IN HERE, OR WHAT?

07:51.427 --> 07:53.342
PLEASE?

07:54.996 --> 07:56.084
PLEEEASE?

08:01.742 --> 08:03.004
NO, THAT SOUNDS GOOD.

08:03.004 --> 08:04.571
JUST MAKE SURE THAT
"WALK TO THE BEACH"

08:04.571 --> 08:07.138
ISN'T, LIKE, 18 MILES
OR UPHILL OR ANYTHING.

08:07.138 --> 08:08.183
OK, GOOD.

08:08.183 --> 08:09.053
LET ME KNOW. BYE.

08:11.012 --> 08:12.187
WHO WAS THAT?

08:12.187 --> 08:13.928
DANA. WE'RE THINKING
ABOUT GETTING

08:13.928 --> 08:14.972
A BEACH HOUSE
THIS SUMMER.

08:14.972 --> 08:16.800
DANA AND ME AND JANET
AND OTHER JANET.

08:16.800 --> 08:18.976
SANTA CRUZ MAYBE.

08:18.976 --> 08:20.021
YOU KNOW, HANG OUT.

08:20.021 --> 08:21.109
GET SOME WAITRESSING JOBS.

08:21.109 --> 08:22.458
I CAN USE YOU
AS A REFERENCE, RIGHT?

08:22.458 --> 08:24.112
WOULD YOU BE GONE
ALL SUMMER?

08:25.592 --> 08:26.854
MAYBE.

08:26.854 --> 08:28.116
YOU KNOW,
IF WE DECIDE TO DO IT,

08:28.116 --> 08:29.160
THEN, YEAH.

08:29.160 --> 08:31.032
HUH.
THAT'D BE WEIRD.

08:31.032 --> 08:31.989
NOT HAVING YOU
AROUND HERE.

08:33.600 --> 08:35.253
HAVE YOU SEEN
MY BLUE TIE,

08:35.253 --> 08:37.125
THE ONE WITH
THE LITTLE SQUARES
ALL OVER IT?

08:39.170 --> 08:40.650
THANK YOU.

08:40.650 --> 08:42.609
WELL, YOU'LL
PROBABLY BE TOO BUSY

08:42.609 --> 08:43.784
TO EVEN NOTICE.

08:43.784 --> 08:47.135
I MEAN, YOU AND ANNIE
ARE OBVIOUSLY...

08:47.135 --> 08:49.441
I DON'T KNOW WHAT
ANNIE AND I ARE.

08:49.441 --> 08:51.705
OR AREN'T.

08:51.705 --> 08:53.402
I MEAN, EVERYTHING
I THOUGHT OF

08:53.402 --> 08:55.143
TO SAY TO HER
WAS LIKE,

08:55.143 --> 08:58.102
WHAT LAND MINE IS
THIS GONNA SET OFF?

08:58.102 --> 09:00.409
IT WAS WEIRD,
BECAUSE ONE SECOND

09:00.409 --> 09:01.889
SHE WAS SAYING HOW
SHE WANTED TO TAKE

09:01.889 --> 09:02.890
EVERYTHING SLOW,

09:02.890 --> 09:04.239
AND THE NEXT MINUTE

09:04.239 --> 09:05.414
WE'RE RIPPING EACH
OTHER'S CLOTHES OFF.

09:05.414 --> 09:07.372
IT'S LIKE
WE JUMPED INTO BED

09:07.372 --> 09:08.678
SO WE WOULDN'T
HAVE TO TALK.

09:08.678 --> 09:09.549
YOU KNOW?

09:12.073 --> 09:13.944
I'LL TAKE
YOUR WORD FOR IT.

09:23.127 --> 09:25.173
I'VE BEEN READING
THE SAME PAGE OVER AND OVER

09:25.173 --> 09:27.262
FOR THE LAST HALF HOUR.

09:27.262 --> 09:28.176
UH-HUH.

09:30.831 --> 09:32.093
LISTEN, UH,

THIS VOICE THAT YOU KEEP
TRYING TO DROWN OUT,

THE SAME THING, TOO,

FOR EACH OTHER.

18:48.475 --> 18:50.738
