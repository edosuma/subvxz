WEBVTT

00:00.331 --> 00:02.589
You are a girl
from the House of Lancaster,

00:02.672 --> 00:05.410
and you live in a country
that is divided.

00:05.641 --> 00:07.699
You may not fall in love
with a York king

00:07.741 --> 00:10.061
unless there is some profit in it
for you.

00:14.861 --> 00:15.899
Will you marry me?

00:15.901 --> 00:17.059
Yes.

00:17.321 --> 00:19.159
Warwick is the Kingmaker,

00:19.161 --> 00:21.639
you can be very sure
he will make the queen as well.

00:21.641 --> 00:26.039
She's my queen of choice and I...
Of choice?! Have you gone mad?

00:26.041 --> 00:28.999
He is a pretender.
He has taken the throne by force.

00:29.001 --> 00:32.558
He is the king and those who speak
against him are guilty of treason.

00:32.561 --> 00:36.159
Now, let us make a son,
to scotch the Lancastrian threat.

00:36.161 --> 00:38.679
It is an honour to meet you,
Duchess Cecily.

00:38.681 --> 00:41.039
I am not happy about this marriage.

00:41.041 --> 00:45.159
I could put his brother, George,
upon the throne in his place.

00:45.161 --> 00:47.119
The King has done
what he should not.

00:47.121 --> 00:48.319
Elizabeth.

00:48.321 --> 00:51.121
There are many who will be cursing
our luck and wishing us to fall.

01:47.321 --> 01:50.679
So, our new queen
is not only Lancastrian

01:50.681 --> 01:53.839
but now we have
half of Burgundy out in force.

01:53.841 --> 01:54.999
Why?

01:55.001 --> 01:56.961
Because she is related to them!

01:58.241 --> 02:02.199
But, Issy, we like her better
than the old bad queen, don't we?

02:02.201 --> 02:05.801
And now we must crown her
before her belly grows too fat.

02:28.281 --> 02:29.321
Elizabeth.

02:31.121 --> 02:32.361
Are you afraid?

02:34.521 --> 02:36.041
Edward will help me know what to do.

02:37.481 --> 02:39.759
They say the whole of London
will be out.

02:39.761 --> 02:41.041
Except one.

02:42.481 --> 02:44.599
Edward's mother has refused to come.

02:44.601 --> 02:46.719
I don't think you'll miss her.

02:46.721 --> 02:48.561
It's one less foot to trip me up!

02:51.441 --> 02:53.519
Lord Warwick.

02:53.521 --> 02:55.321
Is the woman dressed and ready?

02:56.681 --> 02:58.121
She's not made queen yet.

03:09.361 --> 03:10.719
My new sister.

03:10.721 --> 03:13.041
You're as beautiful
as a queen should be.

03:16.521 --> 03:20.481
I pray your child is a son, so he
may follow my brother on his throne.

03:22.401 --> 03:24.159
Thank you, Richard. George.

03:24.161 --> 03:26.241
I am very grateful for your kinship.

03:27.721 --> 03:29.241
Where... Where's Edward?

03:30.641 --> 03:31.721
At the Abbey.

03:33.001 --> 03:36.481
He is to watch the coronation from
behind a screen, as is the custom.

03:37.841 --> 03:39.319
My daughters will escort you.

03:39.321 --> 03:41.479
They have been trained
for such occasions.

03:41.481 --> 03:44.759
The Queen has her own sisters
to attend her.

03:44.761 --> 03:47.921
Your daughters may join
in the procession behind us.

03:52.921 --> 03:54.759
Hold your head high, Elizabeth.

03:54.761 --> 03:56.879
God has chosen you in this

03:56.881 --> 04:00.999
and your brothers and I will be
with you every step of the way.

04:01.001 --> 04:04.281
But now, you are holding my arm
too tightly and I may faint.

04:05.481 --> 04:07.599
You may not faint
because I need you.

04:07.601 --> 04:09.481
You will always be my Elizabeth.

04:10.561 --> 04:12.281
I am so very proud of you.

04:17.161 --> 04:19.959
Anne, you goose!
Stop staring like an idiot!

04:19.961 --> 04:21.999
She is so beautiful.

04:22.000 --> 04:24.799
Yes, but the King should have
married the French princess

04:24.801 --> 04:26.079
as Father had arranged.

04:26.081 --> 04:27.401
Just play your part.

04:28.481 --> 04:30.201
It will not be for very long.

05:12.121 --> 05:13.721
God save the Queen!

05:15.241 --> 05:16.921
Elizabeth!

05:18.081 --> 05:19.601
Elizabeth!

06:49.401 --> 06:50.679
That isn't mother.

06:50.681 --> 06:51.919
It's her, Richard.

06:51.921 --> 06:55.201
She's just in her coronation robes,
that's all. Oh.

07:23.801 --> 07:28.441
I here present unto you, Queen
Elizabeth, your undoubted queen.

07:29.801 --> 07:32.799
Wherefore, all you
who are come this day

07:32.801 --> 07:34.959
to do your homage and service,

07:34.961 --> 07:37.919
are you willing to do the same?

07:37.921 --> 07:39.561
God save the Queen!

07:42.361 --> 07:44.959
Let the anointing of this oil

07:44.961 --> 07:46.879
increase your honour

07:46.881 --> 07:48.681
and establish you for ever.

07:50.081 --> 07:51.801
God save the Queen!

07:57.241 --> 08:00.359
We offer up the sceptres
and the ring,

08:00.361 --> 08:02.759
to our one and mighty queen.

08:02.761 --> 08:05.041
God save the Queen!

08:57.921 --> 08:59.961
Mother! Mother!

09:03.241 --> 09:05.401
Oh, my boys!

09:09.801 --> 09:11.759
Are you Queen now, Mother?

09:11.761 --> 09:16.399
Yes, Richard. But before that,
I shall always be your mother.

09:16.401 --> 09:18.279
May we sit with you at dinner?

09:18.281 --> 09:20.119
I'm sorry, not today.

09:20.121 --> 09:23.441
But later, I shall come and
see you both to bed myself.

09:25.441 --> 09:27.119
Queen Elizabeth?

09:27.121 --> 09:28.601
Your court awaits.

09:41.841 --> 09:44.521
You all look so very similar,
you Rivers girls.

09:45.561 --> 09:47.279
You look like beautiful fish!

09:47.281 --> 09:50.039
I'm not sure I should like to be
a fish! Hello.

09:50.041 --> 09:54.281
George does try to be so charming
but he doesn't always get it right!

09:57.201 --> 09:59.359
Last time we saw you, Richard,

09:59.361 --> 10:02.759
you fell off your horse at our
father's castle, do you remember?

10:02.761 --> 10:05.319
Our father taught King Edward
and put him on the throne

10:05.321 --> 10:07.721
and so now, King Edward must...

10:08.801 --> 10:10.239
What?

10:10.241 --> 10:13.281
So he did,
and Edward loves him for it.

10:15.121 --> 10:17.801
There's a seat here, Anne,
if you'd like it.

10:31.361 --> 10:34.119
Lords and Ladies of the court,

10:34.121 --> 10:37.001
Queen Elizabeth of England.

11:09.721 --> 11:13.481
I did not think
it would be this grand, Edward.

11:14.761 --> 11:17.759
It is to silence those who say
that our marriage is not valid.

11:17.761 --> 11:19.921
Who?! Who says that it is not?

11:21.361 --> 11:22.399
Ah!

11:22.401 --> 11:23.519
Your mother?

11:23.521 --> 11:26.121
The people were denied
a royal wedding.

11:27.401 --> 11:29.399
And so we have given them

11:29.401 --> 11:31.721
a coronation
worthy of the Lord himself.

11:34.121 --> 11:36.359
She does not even know
how to behave!

11:36.361 --> 11:38.839
How would you behave
if you were queen?

11:38.841 --> 11:40.359
Not like that!

11:40.361 --> 11:42.879
I would not whisper with the King!

11:42.881 --> 11:44.759
I would be a queen of stone.

11:44.761 --> 11:46.521
I would have dignity and no emotion.

11:48.681 --> 11:50.481
She doesn't even seem ashamed!

11:54.881 --> 11:57.161
Desperate for this banquet
to end...

11:58.801 --> 12:02.199
Edward, you must attend
to the peace treaty with France.

12:02.201 --> 12:04.959
I have kept it from your door
this week as much as I could but,

12:04.961 --> 12:07.919
now that Charles of Burgundy
has been befriended

12:07.921 --> 12:10.359
and France has been left out,

12:10.361 --> 12:11.719
it cannot wait.

12:11.721 --> 12:13.199
I will attend to it tomorrow.

12:13.201 --> 12:16.079
But now, cousin, feast with us,

12:16.081 --> 12:18.919
for we have won everything
that we set out to

12:18.921 --> 12:20.441
and I wish to see you happy.

12:29.961 --> 12:32.481
How is it that I've allowed you
to wear so many clothes?

12:33.721 --> 12:35.039
I cannot think.

12:35.041 --> 12:38.121
What's the point of being king if I
cannot keep you naked all day long?

12:40.841 --> 12:43.359
We shall have to change
this room, Edward.

12:43.361 --> 12:45.801
It's too odd to have
Margaret of Anjou's things about us.

12:46.761 --> 12:48.161
Change it as you wish.

12:50.241 --> 12:53.119
Shall we be safe, you and I,
upon our thrones?

12:53.121 --> 12:55.879
While Henry is at large,
there's always a chance

12:55.881 --> 12:58.479
of a Lancastrian uprising to put him
back on the throne.

12:58.481 --> 13:00.361
Or his son, Edward.

13:01.881 --> 13:05.679
But when we have our son, we will be
safe, for we will have an heir.

13:05.681 --> 13:07.999
And your own men, do you trust them?

13:08.001 --> 13:09.199
Lord Warwick?

13:09.201 --> 13:10.241
Him of all.

13:12.001 --> 13:16.719
I know he's brusque and has found it
hard to deal with our marriage

13:16.721 --> 13:19.321
but he will learn
to love you as I do.

13:20.441 --> 13:21.681
He already does.

13:23.881 --> 13:26.641
You should ask his girls
to be your ladies!

13:27.881 --> 13:30.841
Make them your favourites.
It will please him.

13:32.881 --> 13:35.919
And his agreement with France?
Will you make that, too?

13:35.921 --> 13:37.241
I'll decide tomorrow...

13:38.881 --> 13:39.921
because now,

13:41.321 --> 13:42.721
I cannot think at all.

13:54.601 --> 13:56.799
Argh.
Now what am I to do with these?

13:56.801 --> 14:00.081
It's not as though Margaret of Anjou
will return for them.

14:02.681 --> 14:04.281
Mother!?

14:07.241 --> 14:09.161
I never thought it would be me
doing this.

14:10.961 --> 14:13.521
I was her closest friend,
when I was her lady at court.

14:15.641 --> 14:17.319
But these are different times.

14:17.321 --> 14:19.079
You are Queen of England now

14:19.081 --> 14:21.441
and you will never make
the same mistakes that she did.

14:23.161 --> 14:26.121
I cannot burn it
or they'll strangle us for witches.

14:28.681 --> 14:30.879
That is interesting, Baron Rivers.

14:30.881 --> 14:32.879
Your advice may well be
worth thinking about.

14:32.881 --> 14:35.319
We are here to serve you,
Your Grace.

14:35.321 --> 14:36.361
Edward?

14:38.001 --> 14:39.041
We'll meet soon.

14:44.001 --> 14:45.439
My lord.

14:45.441 --> 14:46.959
I've drafted out the terms

14:46.961 --> 14:49.319
of England's peace treaty
with France as discussed

14:49.321 --> 14:51.679
and the French Ambassador's
confirmed

14:51.681 --> 14:54.919
he will be able to attend the autumn
hunt, where both parties can sign.

14:54.921 --> 14:56.161
There's no hurry, Warwick.

14:57.441 --> 14:59.961
There are some other players
in the game who I may speak to.

15:01.281 --> 15:02.719
Other...?

15:02.721 --> 15:05.001
I've invited Burgundy, as well.

15:07.441 --> 15:09.839
You've invited the enemy of France?

15:09.841 --> 15:11.119
I wish for them

15:11.121 --> 15:13.919
to lift their restrictions
on the sale of English cloth,

15:13.921 --> 15:16.039
and they are
my wife's own relatives,

15:16.041 --> 15:17.761
so I can hardly leave them out.

15:19.641 --> 15:20.721
Lord Warwick?

15:24.921 --> 15:29.199
I know that I was not your choice
of wife and queen for Edward.

15:29.201 --> 15:32.759
But I hope that we may join in
friendship as we share love for him.

15:32.761 --> 15:35.079
You hope for that, Your Grace?

15:35.081 --> 15:40.681
And also that your daughters will
join my household as my ladies?

15:43.041 --> 15:44.081
Burn her.

15:45.961 --> 15:49.479
We'll have no truck with a queen
who thought to rule her husband

15:49.481 --> 15:51.281
and rule England through him.

15:53.761 --> 15:55.681
We've no need for scheming women.

16:01.961 --> 16:03.759
I know your loyalty to Warwick,

16:03.761 --> 16:06.721
but surely, if he's gone
this far already, Edward...

16:07.721 --> 16:09.121
Edward?

16:13.401 --> 16:15.679
Your father and brothers
have just told me

16:15.681 --> 16:18.721
that Warwick has a secret deal
with the King of France.

16:20.521 --> 16:22.519
Louis has promised him a territory

16:22.521 --> 16:24.841
in exchange
for my alliance with France.

16:25.961 --> 16:29.439
Now, this was once dependent upon me
marrying the Princess Bona

16:29.441 --> 16:33.639
but now rides upon this
so-called peace treaty.

16:33.641 --> 16:35.881
So, Warwick is plotting against you.

16:37.001 --> 16:39.961
Not so much against me
as... for himself.

16:41.681 --> 16:44.239
But he should not have
kept it from me.

16:44.241 --> 16:48.441
So I shall treaty with the side
I think is most useful.

17:00.121 --> 17:03.559
He does not see Warwick's danger.
Even now.

17:03.561 --> 17:05.999
He's clouded by how much
he loves him.

17:06.001 --> 17:08.281
Then you must do the thinking
for him.

17:09.641 --> 17:11.441
Warwick is against the King.

17:12.481 --> 17:14.201
He wants power for himself.

17:15.800 --> 17:17.919
Now, if Edward doesn't stop him,
then you must.

17:17.921 --> 17:21.598
Because otherwise, Warwick
will be king-making again.

17:21.601 --> 17:25.161
And this time it won't be
Edward's head that wears the crown.

17:26.840 --> 17:30.081
And then we all will be in danger.

17:39.561 --> 17:41.519
Come.

17:41.521 --> 17:42.561
Come on.

17:45.561 --> 17:47.479
Hup. Hup.

17:47.481 --> 17:48.521
Hup.

17:49.561 --> 17:51.161
Hup. Hup.

17:54.321 --> 17:55.439
Well done, John!

17:55.441 --> 17:57.001
Well done, John!

18:04.641 --> 18:07.319
He'll have a fight on his hands
against my brother, George.

18:07.321 --> 18:10.041
He has none of Richard's chivalry
and he doesn't like to lose.

18:20.201 --> 18:22.319
Burgundy's here, then.

18:22.321 --> 18:25.479
The Rivers run so deep,
any man could be drowned in them.

18:25.481 --> 18:27.961
My own mother's been washed away.

18:29.601 --> 18:31.241
You could do better?

18:44.361 --> 18:46.959
Edward, the French Ambassador's
feeling slighted

18:46.961 --> 18:49.279
in favour of Charles of Burgundy.

18:49.281 --> 18:51.399
Oh, cheer up, Warwick.

18:51.401 --> 18:53.479
The bigger threat
is still my cousin Henry.

18:53.481 --> 18:56.239
Lancaster will not give up
their hopes for him.

18:56.241 --> 19:00.201
While Henry is at large, there will
always be some army to support him.

19:06.001 --> 19:09.319
Charles has suggested
a marriage between himself

19:09.321 --> 19:12.639
and Margaret of York. He seems very
keen. Mother! Shhh. Not now.

19:12.641 --> 19:14.319
Your mother is right, Elizabeth.

19:14.321 --> 19:17.079
We must build a powerful
royal family around you

19:17.081 --> 19:20.639
to protect you,
and marriages are the way to...

19:20.641 --> 19:22.401
Well done, George!

19:27.961 --> 19:30.039
Good hunting, brother.

19:30.041 --> 19:34.079
As your prize, I shall
confer on you the title...

19:34.081 --> 19:36.281
Earl of Richmond!

19:37.441 --> 19:39.121
And I was hoping for your crown.

19:41.841 --> 19:43.839
Lady Margaret Beaufort
won't be happy.

19:43.841 --> 19:45.359
Richmond is her son's title!

19:45.361 --> 19:48.519
Yes. But he is nephew
to the old King Henry.

19:48.521 --> 19:50.881
So, I must strip it from him.

20:10.121 --> 20:12.199
They have stripped my son
of his title!

20:12.201 --> 20:14.799
They have stripped him
of "The Earl of Richmond"

20:14.801 --> 20:17.519
and given it to that second
York boy, George. I've been told.

20:17.521 --> 20:20.319
You are my husband,
you must get it back for him!

20:20.321 --> 20:22.839
It is his ancestral title
through his... Margaret.

20:22.841 --> 20:25.399
Margaret,
the Yorks rule England now,

20:25.401 --> 20:28.401
and Edward may give the peerages
to whoever he sees fit.

20:30.521 --> 20:34.159
Is it not enough that I am not
allowed to raise my child myself?

20:34.161 --> 20:36.879
That he must be raised
by his uncle Jasper?

20:36.881 --> 20:41.479
He is nephew to King Henry,
in line as Lancastrian heir.

20:41.481 --> 20:43.239
He should not be treated
as though...

20:43.241 --> 20:46.639
Look, you must not boast of this
too loudly, it is the very...

20:46.641 --> 20:49.721
It is the very reason
why the King must keep him down.

20:51.801 --> 20:53.801
His uncle Jasper
would not let this happen!

20:55.041 --> 20:57.759
He would write to Edward
and defend my poor boy!

20:57.761 --> 20:59.921
He would feel his pain, as I do!

21:03.241 --> 21:06.439
I shall go to little Henry myself
and explain to him about his title!

21:06.441 --> 21:09.279
No, it'll mean nothing to him.
The boy is barely five-years-old.

21:09.281 --> 21:12.199
It means something!
It means the world.

21:12.201 --> 21:13.881
It is all he has!

21:20.961 --> 21:22.639
Have you eaten anything today? No.

21:22.641 --> 21:25.241
You are looking very thin again.
I'm fasting.

21:26.321 --> 21:28.839
You cannot live on fresh air alone.
I live on prayer.

21:28.841 --> 21:31.121
And God shall give me sustenance.

21:39.841 --> 21:40.881
Lord Warwick?

21:42.641 --> 21:44.999
Your daughters
have not been brought to me.

21:45.001 --> 21:47.399
I requested them for my household.

21:47.401 --> 21:51.881
My daughters are to wed, Your Grace,
and so sadly, must decline.

21:53.041 --> 21:54.201
The King is aware.

22:05.681 --> 22:06.719
Ah.

22:06.721 --> 22:08.519
I was thinking,

22:08.521 --> 22:10.039
our little Annie

22:10.041 --> 22:13.041
should wed Viscount Bourchier.

22:15.161 --> 22:18.319
And little Katherine could marry
the Duke of Buckingham?

22:18.321 --> 22:20.839
Warwick has refused his daughters
to me mother.

22:20.841 --> 22:24.159
It is a snub
and I do not know what I should do.

22:24.161 --> 22:25.201
He hates me.

22:26.521 --> 22:29.039
But Edward still thinks
we can be friends!

22:29.041 --> 22:30.279
Then what should I do?

22:30.281 --> 22:33.359
Accept his hate or battle through it?

22:33.361 --> 22:35.119
You should do neither.

22:35.121 --> 22:38.719
You should do as Edward says and
make your family strong by marriage,

22:38.721 --> 22:41.039
so you can weather an attack
from anyone.

22:41.041 --> 22:43.321
Now, your brother, John...

22:45.201 --> 22:47.239
What spells are you two weaving?

22:47.241 --> 22:48.559
Father!

22:48.561 --> 22:51.879
Ah, the goddess of love
is busy with her work, I see!

22:51.881 --> 22:55.279
There is no love in this, Richard.
Only business.

22:55.281 --> 22:57.241
You see how Mother changed her tune?

22:59.441 --> 23:02.479
When she set her heart on you,
the lowly squire,

23:02.481 --> 23:05.599
she caused quite the scandal,
saying true love was enough.

23:05.601 --> 23:07.399
It was worth it.

23:07.401 --> 23:10.641
For I have the most beautiful
lady in the kingdom.

23:12.361 --> 23:15.839
And I the handsomest, kindest,
most loving man.

23:15.841 --> 23:18.641
Who has just been made Treasurer!

23:19.721 --> 23:22.199
Richard! Then Warwick's uncle
has been set aside?

23:22.201 --> 23:24.519
Edward is unhappy with him
over France.

23:24.521 --> 23:27.079
And Anthony has
Admiralty of the Fleet

23:27.081 --> 23:30.559
and Lionel will be
Bishop as he's always wanted.

23:30.561 --> 23:31.959
Richard!

23:31.961 --> 23:33.039
Yes, yes.

23:33.041 --> 23:34.479
Go and fetch the midwife.

23:34.481 --> 23:38.481
I think our first York prince
wishes to join the world.

23:40.401 --> 23:41.839
That's it, come on, push.

23:41.841 --> 23:43.881
Push-push-push.

23:45.401 --> 23:47.481
That's it. That's it.

23:49.881 --> 23:51.761
Good girl, shh.

23:57.961 --> 23:59.599
Give him to me, Mary?

23:59.601 --> 24:01.641
Let me hold him.

24:03.561 --> 24:04.841
It's a girl.

24:06.961 --> 24:08.001
A little girl.

24:12.041 --> 24:13.639
Where is he?
The Queen is not ready.

24:13.641 --> 24:16.281
Let me see him! I am king.
You cannot keep me from my son.

24:18.281 --> 24:19.839
It's a girl, Edward.

24:19.841 --> 24:21.321
It's a girl.

24:30.521 --> 24:31.841
Mind the head. Take the head.

24:36.561 --> 24:38.479
She is a beautiful girl.

24:38.481 --> 24:41.399
We will love her very well.

24:41.401 --> 24:44.281
We shall have boys, Edward.

24:45.641 --> 24:47.439
Sons and heirs.

24:47.441 --> 24:48.881
They shall come. I know.

24:50.321 --> 24:55.121
You are so very lovely, Elizabeth.
I could not do without you.

25:28.481 --> 25:30.041
It's a girl!

25:32.521 --> 25:37.881
The Queen has had
a little baby girl for Edward.

25:41.121 --> 25:44.799
It makes little odds
that he has no heir

25:44.801 --> 25:46.559
when she has taken all the nobles

25:46.561 --> 25:48.719
and there's no-one left
for ours to wed.

25:48.721 --> 25:50.719
Ah, but...

25:50.721 --> 25:54.639
I have found
the biggest prize of all,

25:54.641 --> 25:57.199
and the King

25:57.201 --> 25:59.201
will give me anything I want for it.

26:23.561 --> 26:24.599
My Lady.

26:24.601 --> 26:25.879
Stafford.

26:25.881 --> 26:27.079
Lord Tudor.

26:27.081 --> 26:28.119
Are you well?

26:28.121 --> 26:29.359
We are in fine health.

26:29.361 --> 26:30.999
Shall we ride in?

26:31.001 --> 26:32.721
Jasper, how is my Henry?

26:34.481 --> 26:37.161
He's thriving.
You'll barely know him.

26:41.001 --> 26:42.519
Henry?

26:42.521 --> 26:44.119
Henry!

26:44.121 --> 26:46.039
Come to your mother.

26:46.041 --> 26:47.761
Come on, you must remember me?

26:49.881 --> 26:51.081
Go on, Henry.

26:52.761 --> 26:54.041
Lady Mother.

27:01.481 --> 27:06.879
Henry, I miss you very much
and I would have come sooner,

27:06.881 --> 27:10.081
but I have been made to live
very far away from you.

27:11.321 --> 27:13.839
It is punishment for my loyalties.

27:13.841 --> 27:17.359
Henry, the wicked York king,
has taken your title.

27:17.361 --> 27:20.079
But we will get it back for you.
We will.

27:20.081 --> 27:23.321
Do not fill his head with nonsense,
Margaret, he will not get it back!

27:24.841 --> 27:27.199
He should be playing in the sun
with other children,

27:27.201 --> 27:28.879
not cooped up here,
like some invalid!

27:28.881 --> 27:31.279
There are no families
of breeding near enough

27:31.281 --> 27:34.039
for a suitable companion.
Well, perhaps little Henry

27:34.041 --> 27:36.759
could show me the stables
and the horses while we're here?

27:36.761 --> 27:37.841
May I?

27:38.961 --> 27:40.041
Go on.

27:42.441 --> 27:46.319
Come now. Come and see our horses.
We have names for all of them.

27:46.321 --> 27:48.521
I expect you're a very good rider.
Yes.

27:59.841 --> 28:01.361
Tell me he is good to you?

28:04.201 --> 28:06.081
Tell me that, at least. He, er...

28:09.641 --> 28:10.801
I have an allowance.

28:12.641 --> 28:13.681
I, er...

28:15.001 --> 28:16.399
I buy books.

28:16.401 --> 28:19.521
I read the Gospel.
He's teaching me to read in Latin.

28:23.161 --> 28:24.561
I missed you, Margaret.

28:27.321 --> 28:29.039
More than I can tell. Don't.

28:29.041 --> 28:30.801
You must not.

28:39.961 --> 28:42.279
I've received a letter
from my brother.

28:42.281 --> 28:45.279
My nephew is to be betrothed
to the Queen's sister, Katherine,

28:45.281 --> 28:47.279
and we are called to London
for the wedding.

28:47.281 --> 28:50.639
The Duke of Buckingham...
to a common country girl?!

28:50.641 --> 28:52.801
I will not go.
You will, Margaret.

28:54.401 --> 28:55.841
And you will be gracious.

29:01.161 --> 29:03.719
Your mother will be there.
It will be a chance to see her, too.

29:03.721 --> 29:06.041
You've not seen her
since we married.

29:10.121 --> 29:11.161
Shall we?

29:18.841 --> 29:23.639
In nomine Patris, et Filii,
et Spiritus Sancti. Amen.

29:23.641 --> 29:24.801
Amen.

29:33.801 --> 29:38.041
Look at my little sister, Katherine,
with her sulky new husband, the Duke.

29:48.281 --> 29:50.159
Who would have thought
so happy an occasion

29:50.161 --> 29:52.599
would have made so many
so miserable?!

29:52.601 --> 29:54.399
Lord Warwick isn't even here.

29:54.401 --> 29:55.881
So much the better.

29:58.921 --> 30:02.799
Congratulations, Your Grace,
on your first York princess.

30:02.801 --> 30:06.879
She is not a boy though,
so you have no heir.

30:06.881 --> 30:09.119
I shall have many more,
Duchess Cecily,

30:09.121 --> 30:10.721
and the next one shall be a boy.

30:12.441 --> 30:14.161
Edward? What is that?

30:24.481 --> 30:26.519
King Henry!

30:26.521 --> 30:31.279
My Lords. Our one time king, Henry,
and now, our prisoner.

30:31.281 --> 30:33.679
He was roaming
the fields of Northumberland

30:33.681 --> 30:35.959
but I have ridden out
and captured him.

30:35.961 --> 30:38.559
And you have brought him in!
No, Richard!

30:38.561 --> 30:41.479
Then let us take vengeance for our
father he murdered! You will not!

30:41.481 --> 30:44.039
He is an anointed king.

30:44.041 --> 30:47.961
And how should we be any better
if we match him in his butchery?

30:52.641 --> 30:56.921
He is a traitor
and an enemy to my rule.

30:57.961 --> 31:03.521
But God has brought him to us to
show that my reign is just and true.

31:06.121 --> 31:08.479
We shall keep cousin Henry
in the Tower apartments

31:08.481 --> 31:12.201
and show him a mercy
that he denied our father.

31:13.961 --> 31:16.001
Go in God, cousin.

31:28.561 --> 31:30.599
I'm once again indebted to you,
Warwick.

31:30.601 --> 31:32.641
I serve you, Edward, as ever.

31:35.961 --> 31:39.879
Might I have a word with Your Grace?
Of course.

31:39.881 --> 31:42.799
God bless him, poor Henry...

31:42.801 --> 31:45.199
Warwick is up to something, Mother.

31:45.201 --> 31:47.121
Can we ever trust him?

31:59.401 --> 32:02.041
Girls, I have something to tell you.

32:05.401 --> 32:09.201
You must keep it a secret for now.
Do you promise? Yes, Lady Mother.

32:10.281 --> 32:13.039
Your father is asking
King Edward for the royal dukes,

32:13.041 --> 32:16.121
his brothers, to be given
in marriage to the two of you.

32:17.801 --> 32:21.121
You will marry George.
And I shall have Richard!

32:22.521 --> 32:24.679
See how Anne is blushing!

32:24.681 --> 32:26.919
You cannot think to like him?

32:26.921 --> 32:30.119
He's got such funny eyes
and he's so serious.

32:30.121 --> 32:33.919
Stop it, Issy! She, of course,
will try to stop it.

32:33.921 --> 32:36.479
But the King will not refuse
your father,

32:36.481 --> 32:38.439
not if he asks him to his face.

32:38.441 --> 32:40.601
Not now, after bringing Henry in.

32:43.161 --> 32:45.599
And the two of you will
be royal duchesses.

32:45.601 --> 32:48.201
You will outrank
the King's own mother.

32:55.001 --> 32:57.041
I am to marry Richard.

33:01.241 --> 33:03.281
Your Grace.

33:15.561 --> 33:18.319
However could they bring poor
King Henry in like that?

33:18.321 --> 33:21.519
You must not call him "King",
my love. He is the king
in the eyes of God.

33:21.521 --> 33:24.119
They have sinned to
take his throne away from him!

33:24.121 --> 33:27.719
Complaining, Margaret?
Good evening to you, Lady Beauchamp.

33:27.721 --> 33:30.719
Lady Mother.
You know my son, don't you?

33:30.721 --> 33:34.439
Richard Welles
is Margaret's half-brother.

33:34.441 --> 33:36.239
He's my pride and joy.

33:36.241 --> 33:39.039
As my son would be
if you'd let me keep him with me.

33:39.041 --> 33:42.959
Ever the drama, Margaret.
..I see she has not changed at all.

33:42.961 --> 33:44.801
Ladies.

33:51.601 --> 33:55.079
Henry is my son! He is mine!

33:55.081 --> 33:57.999
And you have remarried.
A man I did not want to.

33:58.001 --> 34:00.839
A man you forced upon me.
A man I did not choose.

34:00.841 --> 34:02.681
Oh, Margaret. This again.

34:04.081 --> 34:06.599
You are a girl, you do not choose.

34:06.601 --> 34:08.958
You live the life
your mother chooses for you,

34:08.960 --> 34:11.001
or your husband does.

34:12.201 --> 34:15.359
Then why could you not
have chosen Jasper Tudor?

34:15.360 --> 34:17.478
Oh, I've seen your
puppy eyes for him

34:17.481 --> 34:20.241
since long before his brother
withered of the plague.

34:21.241 --> 34:24.799
Then why choose Stafford?
I thought he was a better match.

34:24.801 --> 34:27.241
And I do not care if you are happy.

34:38.880 --> 34:40.920
Hello.

34:42.400 --> 34:45.039
There were too many
commoners in there.

34:45.041 --> 34:47.561
And all of them want marriages.

34:49.440 --> 34:51.481
Isn't that what you want, Isabel?

35:03.401 --> 35:06.441
George.
Brother.

35:09.881 --> 35:11.921
Edward, there you are!

35:15.401 --> 35:17.881
So what did Lord Warwick want?

35:20.801 --> 35:24.561
My brothers for his girls.
For Isabel and Anne?

35:26.441 --> 35:28.481
I said I would think about it.

35:29.761 --> 35:31.759
Edward?

35:31.761 --> 35:34.359
If Warwick's daughters
are married to your brothers,

35:34.361 --> 35:36.719
they will share the biggest
fortune in the kingdom

35:36.721 --> 35:38.479
and have royal blood
upon both sides.

35:38.481 --> 35:41.119
Do you imagine they will not
come against you if you grant it?

35:41.121 --> 35:43.719
Damn it, Elizabeth!
Warwick is not the enemy.

35:43.721 --> 35:45.719
He is a friend
and I have disregarded him.

35:45.721 --> 35:48.719
And I am resolved to sign the treaty
with Burgundy against France...

35:48.721 --> 35:51.679
Shh. No! And it will be two years
of his life that have been wasted.

35:51.681 --> 35:53.239
I must give him something.

35:53.241 --> 35:55.079
Then give him something.

35:55.081 --> 35:56.641
But not this.

35:57.681 --> 36:02.481
You must show him you are
your own man, and king now.

36:03.521 --> 36:06.681
He may not grow too powerful
and come against you.

36:11.841 --> 36:13.601
You're right.

36:15.001 --> 36:16.639
Of course you are.

36:16.641 --> 36:19.001
Perhaps he won't mind so much.

36:20.361 --> 36:22.679
He's usually happy with more land.

36:22.681 --> 36:26.241
I could offer him more of Wales,
take it away from Jasper Tudor.

36:41.001 --> 36:43.761
Am I so bad
not even you may love me?

36:45.961 --> 36:48.001
Tell me of your plan for me?

36:50.081 --> 36:52.401
Tell me there is a purpose?

36:53.401 --> 36:55.241
Give me a sign, Lord.

36:56.801 --> 36:59.521
Tell me at least that my son
may have a destiny!

37:18.441 --> 37:21.799
Margaret? I've been
looking for you all night.

37:21.801 --> 37:23.841
What have you been do...

37:28.561 --> 37:30.599
Come on.

37:30.601 --> 37:32.521
We are leaving.

38:26.161 --> 38:28.639
Where's the Countess?
Your Grace.

38:28.641 --> 38:31.201
Bring her in here!

38:33.441 --> 38:35.239
But how?

38:35.241 --> 38:37.599
How could he refuse you?

38:37.601 --> 38:39.679
He promised they would be married.

38:39.681 --> 38:42.719
The King has lost his mind,
he's thinking with his breeches

38:42.721 --> 38:44.759
and all for some
little country whore!

38:44.761 --> 38:48.959
Do you think it may be witchcraft?
It could be for no other reason!

38:48.961 --> 38:52.439
This is what you get when you put
the Devil on the throne of England.

38:52.441 --> 38:55.119
And now he is to sign
this deal with Burgundy

38:55.121 --> 38:56.999
which will make me
look a fool to France

38:57.001 --> 38:59.641
which is precisely what she wanted!

39:00.881 --> 39:03.919
Well, she will not win this!
We will bide our time.

39:03.921 --> 39:06.559
She has no son yet.

39:06.561 --> 39:08.401
She will NOT win!

39:17.801 --> 39:19.961
What will happen to us, Issy?

39:21.481 --> 39:23.841
Well, Father will find us
someone else, I suppose.

39:25.641 --> 39:27.799
Couldn't you marry
the Prince of France?

39:27.801 --> 39:29.479
He's not yet married.

39:29.481 --> 39:31.599
What use is a Prince of France?

39:31.601 --> 39:34.679
We must get ourselves
in the line of succession here.

39:34.681 --> 39:37.999
Everything that has happened,
Annie, is her fault.

39:38.001 --> 39:40.961
She has ruined our matches and...

39:43.161 --> 39:45.201
we are insulted.

39:46.681 --> 39:49.361
She is another bad queen,
just like the last one.

39:55.041 --> 39:57.161
Tell me about
the old bad queen, Issy?

39:58.401 --> 40:00.161
What was she like again?

40:04.241 --> 40:07.841
The bad queen called herself
Margaret of Anjou...

40:10.041 --> 40:15.319
but really she was a she-wolf
and she rode at the head of an army

40:15.321 --> 40:21.719
of naked, wild men and everything
in their path turned to ice!

40:21.721 --> 40:27.399
They carried the sleeping king
forward in a big glass coffin,

40:27.401 --> 40:31.319
and while he slept
the she-wolf tore apart England

40:31.321 --> 40:33.361
with her terrible ambition!

40:34.401 --> 40:36.401
She murdered our grandfather...

40:38.441 --> 40:41.761
and she tried to spear Father
with a roasting spit!

40:45.881 --> 40:49.239
But one day, Father and King Edward

40:49.241 --> 40:54.079
fought a battle against her,
uphill, in the snow.

40:54.081 --> 40:57.121
It was the bloodiest battle ever...

40:59.001 --> 41:02.479
and she lost so she
blew away like a blizzard

41:02.481 --> 41:06.001
into the cold, cold north.

41:08.081 --> 41:11.119
And Edward became the king.

41:11.121 --> 41:13.399
"Hurrah! Hurrah!"

41:13.401 --> 41:15.279
And her son? The Prince of Ice?

41:15.281 --> 41:16.919
Ah, yes.

41:16.921 --> 41:19.319
Prince Edward is an ice boy.

41:19.321 --> 41:23.041
He cut off two men's heads
when he was only seven years old!

41:26.281 --> 41:28.479
But he isn't really Henry's boy,

41:28.481 --> 41:31.719
because the king
was always sleeping.

41:31.721 --> 41:33.641
So they say that his father...

41:35.841 --> 41:37.881
is the Devil!

41:42.681 --> 41:44.521
Thank you, Issy.

41:47.441 --> 41:51.041
Don't worry, Annie.
Father will think of something.

41:53.001 --> 41:55.041
Father always has a plan.

42:12.001 --> 42:13.559
The King has chosen Burgundy

42:13.561 --> 42:16.441
and Warwick's secret deal
with France is over.

42:18.601 --> 42:23.119
The King's sister, Margaret,
will marry our very own cousin,
Charles of Burgundy.

42:23.121 --> 42:27.999
So Warwick is escorting Margaret
to her wedding in Burgundy?

42:28.001 --> 42:30.001
Ah, he's a nursemaid!

42:32.041 --> 42:34.879
So now he won't
get his land in France.

42:34.881 --> 42:37.521
And you, Elizabeth, must have sons.

43:01.881 --> 43:03.801
Look at your hair.

43:04.881 --> 43:07.799
Mary?
Mother!

43:07.801 --> 43:09.761
Lizzie? Could you hold Mary?

43:19.321 --> 43:21.161
Your Grace!

43:28.401 --> 43:31.921
We shall never get there if we must
stop every three minutes, girls!

43:32.921 --> 43:34.959
Where's Father?

43:34.961 --> 43:38.601
I told you, he's travelling his
kingdom. We're riding to join him.

43:42.921 --> 43:46.039
Elizabeth.
Father! What are you doing here?

43:46.041 --> 43:47.839
We are to ride with you.

43:47.841 --> 43:51.039
There is a rebellion,
a Robin of Redesdale.

43:51.041 --> 43:54.079
That's a fanciful name
for some petty rebel, Father.

43:54.081 --> 43:56.279
Ed will stamp it all
out in a heartbeat.

43:56.281 --> 43:57.999
Someone is paying the men,
Elizabeth.

43:58.001 --> 44:00.519
They have strong, new boots
and this is Warwick's country.

44:00.521 --> 44:04.759
Warwick? What threat is Warwick to us
now? This is no joke, Elizabeth.

44:04.761 --> 44:06.559
It is certain.

44:06.561 --> 44:09.199
There are thousands of men-in-arms
under Warwick's orders.

44:09.201 --> 44:11.161
He is king-making again.

44:19.001 --> 44:21.641
Oh, Issy. You look beautiful.

44:24.281 --> 44:26.479
Do you think George
will adore me, Annie?

44:26.481 --> 44:28.481
The way that the King does her?

44:31.001 --> 44:33.959
I am sorry that Father
could not get Richard for you.

44:33.961 --> 44:37.079
It is not him I was concerned with.

44:37.081 --> 44:39.201
Just, I did rather
want to be a duchess.

44:45.761 --> 44:48.121
Come. Let's get this done.

44:51.121 --> 44:53.199
Annie.

44:53.201 --> 44:55.241
Annie, please don't leave me.

45:04.001 --> 45:06.641
Mother! Mother!
My boys!

45:13.721 --> 45:15.519
I knew that Warwick was angry

45:15.521 --> 45:18.359
but never did I imagine he would
raise his own army against me!

45:18.361 --> 45:20.359
He has betrayed me!

45:20.361 --> 45:24.039
And so has George, for now I hear
he has married Isabel

45:24.041 --> 45:25.919
against my clear command!

45:25.921 --> 45:28.719
Warwick's plan must be to put George
upon the throne instead of me.

45:28.721 --> 45:31.559
God damn them both! But are you
sure that is what they are doing?

45:31.561 --> 45:33.359
I am sure of nothing!

45:33.361 --> 45:36.079
We have always stood shoulder
to shoulder on the battlefield.

45:36.081 --> 45:39.119
At the battle of Mortimer's Cross
there were three suns in the sky.

45:39.121 --> 45:40.639
Three suns!

45:40.641 --> 45:42.879
Everybody said it was
a sign from God for me,

45:42.881 --> 45:44.839
Richard and George,
the three Sons of York.

45:44.841 --> 45:46.559
So how can one brother betray
the others?

45:46.561 --> 45:49.199
With Warwick, the man you
thought of as your greatest friend.

45:49.201 --> 45:50.959
And who else betrays
us with them, huh?

45:50.961 --> 45:53.999
Our mother is not here, she's surely
gone to attend their wedding.

45:54.001 --> 45:55.959
George is her darling, after all.

45:55.961 --> 45:57.719
Why would she back George
instead of you?

45:57.721 --> 46:00.439
The old story.
Whether I am my father's son.

46:00.441 --> 46:04.439
Whether I am legitimate!
George is saying that I am a bastard

46:04.441 --> 46:06.719
and that would make him
the true York heir.

46:06.721 --> 46:11.481
Damn him! We will go and scotch
this snakes' nest before it comes
out of the ground.

46:14.681 --> 46:16.399
Annie! Annie!

46:16.401 --> 46:17.839
What is it?

46:17.841 --> 46:20.039
Was George bad to you?

46:20.041 --> 46:22.279
Has he hurt you?

46:22.281 --> 46:26.559
Yes, but no more than
Mother said I should expect.

46:26.561 --> 46:28.999
That's not it.

46:29.001 --> 46:31.041
It's very much worse, Annie.

46:32.521 --> 46:35.281
My wedding was never for me at all.

46:36.521 --> 46:40.681
It was a sign from Father that
men should rise against the King.

46:44.521 --> 46:47.801
George.

46:56.721 --> 46:59.359
Go to the city of Norwich.
Be a queen. Look unconcerned.

46:59.361 --> 47:02.319
I just cannot bear that this
is happening. You must take care.

47:02.321 --> 47:03.959
Please, all of you.

47:03.961 --> 47:06.001
Father, stay safe.

47:07.921 --> 47:09.999
Elizabeth, trust no-one.

47:10.001 --> 47:13.521
Show them you are queen.
We will be back soon.

47:55.561 --> 47:57.001
Your Grace.

48:52.281 --> 48:55.039
Still no word?

48:55.041 --> 48:57.119
Warwick's got past our look-out.

48:57.121 --> 48:58.879
His army's coming to besiege us.

48:58.881 --> 49:00.639
Ride to the protection of London.

49:00.641 --> 49:02.839
Go, Edward!
We'll stay and hold him off!

49:02.841 --> 49:04.799
TO ARMS!

49:04.801 --> 49:06.921
Quickly! Quickly, men!

49:38.041 --> 49:40.081
Lord Warwick's back!

49:54.401 --> 49:57.081
He's done it. Father has the King!

50:09.401 --> 50:13.439
"Dearest wife,
prepare yourself for bad news.

50:13.441 --> 50:15.881
"I am prisoner, held by Warwick.

50:18.201 --> 50:21.759
"I am unhurt but
you are in very grave danger

50:21.761 --> 50:24.799
"as Warwick will
come after you if he can.

50:24.801 --> 50:26.999
"Your father
and brothers have escaped

50:27.001 --> 50:29.199
"and will be on their way to you.

50:29.201 --> 50:31.159
"You must hasten to London.

50:31.161 --> 50:34.239
"You must raise the city
and arm the Tower for a siege.

50:34.241 --> 50:37.481
"For if George has a son,
we are lost.

50:38.481 --> 50:40.479
"I love you with all of my heart.

50:40.481 --> 50:44.039
"The one and only,
King of England.

50:44.041 --> 50:46.081
"Edward."

50:51.281 --> 50:54.079
Anthony! Thank God!
We must go to London! Sister.

50:54.081 --> 50:56.959
Warwick has captured Edward
and he's coming after me. Elizabeth.

50:56.961 --> 51:00.599
Are Father and John with you? Edward
said we must go to London. Sister!

51:00.601 --> 51:03.641
Our father... and John...

51:05.241 --> 51:07.281
they're dead.

51:10.241 --> 51:12.159
No. They were beheaded.

51:12.161 --> 51:15.919
There was no charge, no trial,
only the word of Warwick.

51:15.921 --> 51:18.639
No! Edward said...
You, you all escaped!

51:18.641 --> 51:22.119
There was an ambush.
They were waiting on the road ahead.

51:22.121 --> 51:26.279
No, Anthony! No, God!
No! Say it's not true, Anthony!

51:26.281 --> 51:28.401
NO!

51:58.721 --> 52:00.639
Jasper! Morning, Margaret.

52:00.641 --> 52:03.079
You have heard?
They've snatched him!

52:03.081 --> 52:04.879
Like the crown from the top
of the maypole.

52:04.881 --> 52:07.719
I do not know what they intend,
but I shall write to George

52:07.721 --> 52:11.279
and tell him he can name his price
if it will return my son his title.

52:11.281 --> 52:13.361
My husband must not know.

52:17.121 --> 52:18.759
My Lord. Stafford.

52:18.761 --> 52:22.721
Take me to Henry, Jasper. I have
something marvellous to tell him.

52:24.361 --> 52:26.001
Come.

52:28.521 --> 52:30.319
My Lord. Henry.

52:30.321 --> 52:31.761
Yes.

52:39.601 --> 52:41.559
Today is a special day

52:41.561 --> 52:44.159
because I have something
important to tell you.

52:44.161 --> 52:46.199
I have known this for a long time

52:46.201 --> 52:49.241
but I have waited until I was sure
to tell you both.

52:53.761 --> 52:57.159
You will be king.
Have you lost your senses, Margaret?

52:57.161 --> 52:59.959
God has told me in a vision, Henry.

52:59.961 --> 53:01.961
He said that you are His Chosen One.

53:03.081 --> 53:07.239
And you will be
King Henry Tudor of England.

53:07.241 --> 53:09.199
Ignore what your mother
just said, Henry,

53:09.201 --> 53:11.919
for it is treason and she
would surely lose her head for it.

53:11.921 --> 53:15.119
You had a vision?
And I have prayed upon it.

53:15.121 --> 53:17.999
But now, the old York poison
splits their House in two

53:18.001 --> 53:20.681
I know God has spoken to me truly.

53:21.681 --> 53:23.319
I will not hear this!

53:23.321 --> 53:25.999
Elizabeth makes only little
witches for the burning

53:26.001 --> 53:28.319
and perhaps the other
Yorks will be as cursed.

53:28.321 --> 53:31.639
And when they are,
we will be waiting with my boy

53:31.641 --> 53:33.921
for his chance upon the throne.

53:38.401 --> 53:40.719
God has said you will be king

53:40.721 --> 53:43.801
and you must hold that
in your heart.

53:45.401 --> 53:47.599
And when you are crowned king,

53:47.601 --> 53:49.879
my mother will kneel to me

53:49.881 --> 53:52.161
and she will call me
"Margaret Regina".

54:58.361 --> 55:00.121
What kind of a monster is he?

55:01.321 --> 55:04.679
No charge, no trial,
no chance for a defence?

55:04.681 --> 55:07.559
It was an execution.
And I shall have his head for it!

55:07.561 --> 55:09.921
Warwick cannot go unpunished!

55:11.081 --> 55:14.399
I cannot bear it, Mother.
Your father knew the risks.

55:14.401 --> 55:17.201
God knows, it wasn't
his first battle.

55:19.921 --> 55:22.161
He sent me this
before they killed him.

55:24.441 --> 55:27.199
He tells me to be happy,

55:27.201 --> 55:29.481
sends you his love.

55:35.001 --> 55:36.921
John is such a loss to me.

55:38.601 --> 55:41.121
He had his whole life ahead of him.

55:44.201 --> 55:48.439
When you raise a boy
and he becomes a man,

55:48.441 --> 55:52.199
you start to believe
that he is safe

55:52.201 --> 55:54.479
and that you are safe
from heartbreak.

55:54.481 --> 55:56.599
I should have known.

55:56.601 --> 56:00.079
I have the Sight,
I should have seen it.

56:00.081 --> 56:02.641
Edward's mother will know this pain.

56:03.801 --> 56:06.999
She will know the loss
of her son George. I swear it.

56:07.001 --> 56:10.961
You have lost a son and so shall she!
What should that achieve?

56:12.241 --> 56:15.559
It will not bring them back.
And there will be war again.

56:15.561 --> 56:17.799
They still have Edward!

56:17.801 --> 56:22.161
I must avenge my father and my
brother or God knows I shall go mad!

56:23.721 --> 56:25.919
I've tried to do it differently.

56:25.921 --> 56:29.761
I tried to do what Edward asked
and make them all my friends.

56:31.601 --> 56:34.761
But now I want them dead.

56:41.281 --> 56:43.121
Tear off a corner.

56:46.321 --> 56:48.681
Write their names on it in blood.

56:49.761 --> 56:52.081
Heat the charm,
keep it in the darkness.

56:54.601 --> 56:57.241
Do it by the riverside
on the waning moon.

57:42.601 --> 57:47.761
Richard Neville, Earl of Warwick.
I curse you.

57:49.881 --> 57:55.601
George Plantagenet, Duke
of Clarence, I curse you too.

58:08.361 --> 58:11.521
By my will, you both shall die.

58:15.672 --> 58:47.979
