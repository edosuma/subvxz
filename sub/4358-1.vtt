00:22.160 --> 00:24.320
[dog barking]

00:25.920 --> 00:27.320
Are you planning to get up?

00:27.320 --> 00:30.240
You know there is no way 
 Mom's going to let you sleep

00:30.240 --> 00:33.360
through your first day 
 of Junior High School.

00:34.200 --> 00:36.080
Alex.

00:37.440 --> 00:42.520
- Yes. 
 - Isn't it an exciting day?

00:51.640 --> 00:54.800
You sent for me, Miss Atron?

00:55.040 --> 00:59.720
Vince, I just got off the phone 
 with our testing facility.

00:59.720 --> 01:04.959
They'll be ready for GC-161 
 transport later this afternoon.

01:04.959 --> 01:06.880
That's very good news, Miss Atron.

01:06.880 --> 01:08.280
It has to go smoothly.

01:08.280 --> 01:11.520
You're the only one I can 
 trust with this sort of thing.

01:11.520 --> 01:15.920
- You won't have to think about it again. 
 - I won't.

01:15.920 --> 01:19.600
[Man] 
 Attention, attention, please stand by.

01:19.600 --> 01:22.680
[alarm sounding]

01:22.680 --> 01:24.360
[steam hissing]

01:24.360 --> 01:26.120
[beeping]

01:52.760 --> 01:55.560
[steam hissing]

02:02.480 --> 02:05.200
You know what, 
 I'll have reschedule that lunch.

02:05.200 --> 02:08.120
Can you make sure that 
 I have that market research

02:08.120 --> 02:10.160
on my deck when I get in this morning?

02:10.160 --> 02:11.880
Right, let me talk to Judy.

02:11.880 --> 02:13.440
Annie, where is your sister?

02:13.440 --> 02:17.360
Upstairs, trying unsuccessfully 
 to define herself through fashion.

02:17.360 --> 02:19.520
I should just face it.

02:19.520 --> 02:23.720
I'm boring. 
 Plain and simple.

02:27.000 --> 02:28.160
Boring.

02:28.160 --> 02:29.560
What are you working on, Dad?

02:29.560 --> 02:32.320
You haven't taken your 
 eyes off that screen for days.

02:32.320 --> 02:35.440
This new compound I was 
 telling you about-- GC-161.

02:35.440 --> 02:38.360
There's a real buzz 
 at the plant about it.

02:38.360 --> 02:40.760
Are you on their mechanism 
 or applications end?

02:40.760 --> 02:44.320
Strictly the mechanism. Everything 
 else about it is very top secret.

02:44.320 --> 02:47.240
I have no idea what 
 they have in mind for it

02:47.240 --> 02:50.280
but it has some 
 extraordinary properties.

02:50.280 --> 02:54.360
- Hmm. 
 - [steam hissing]

03:02.920 --> 03:05.520
- [doorbell chiming] 
 - Annie!

03:05.760 --> 03:08.880
- [Annie] It's open! 
 - [ringing tone]

03:08.880 --> 03:11.520
- Hi. 
 - Oh, yes, good morning.

03:11.520 --> 03:14.360
This is Barbara Mack 
 returning you call.

03:14.360 --> 03:17.120
- Uh-huh. 
 - Hold? Sure, I can hold.

03:18.360 --> 03:21.680
- Hi, Mr Mack. 
 - Good morning, Raymond.

03:21.680 --> 03:23.280
Where's Alex?

03:23.280 --> 03:24.920
Going through 
 pre-traumatic stress syndrome.

03:24.920 --> 03:29.160
[Barbara] Alex, 
 you've missed breakfast.

03:29.160 --> 03:32.280
That's okay, 
 I'm not really hungry.

03:32.280 --> 03:34.240
I can eat.

03:34.240 --> 03:37.280
You must be nervous about 
 your first day at school.

03:37.280 --> 03:39.280
Everything is going to be just fine.

03:39.280 --> 03:43.200
Just don't expect me to be 
 the award-winning genius like Annie.

03:43.200 --> 03:45.000
We don't expect that, sweetie.

03:45.000 --> 03:47.280
[Annie] 
 That's true, Alex.

03:47.280 --> 03:51.080
In fact, if you just pass on to 
 the next grade they'll be ecstatic.

03:51.080 --> 03:52.880
Annie, enough.

03:54.120 --> 03:56.640
Alex, I have a surprise for you.

03:59.960 --> 04:03.520
[Annie sarcastically] Trolls! 
 Very cutting edge, huh, Alex?

04:05.200 --> 04:08.280
Thanks, Mom. 
 I'd better get going.

04:08.280 --> 04:13.240
George. Isn't there something 
 you want to say to Alex

04:13.240 --> 04:16.079
before her first day at school? 
 [clears throat]

04:16.079 --> 04:19.399
Well, Alex... 
 [clears throat]

04:19.399 --> 04:22.280
um, first day... well...

04:22.280 --> 04:24.600
Mmm... good luck.

04:26.640 --> 04:28.040
Raymond.

04:32.440 --> 04:36.240
There's no more monkey bars. 
 The stakes are bigger

04:36.240 --> 04:38.920
the work's harder 
 the girls prettier.

04:38.920 --> 04:45.000
And you sink or swim. 
 And me... I'm a shark.

04:47.280 --> 04:48.760
[school bell ringing]

04:48.760 --> 04:51.480
[music from Jaws playing]

05:07.960 --> 05:10.480
[teacher] So we'll start 
 with a little review.

05:10.480 --> 05:12.880
You have covered 
 most of this territory

05:12.880 --> 05:16.040
in your sixth-grade math classes.

05:29.360 --> 05:32.040
[all laughing]

05:32.040 --> 05:35.240
Class, please, settle down. 
 Where was I?

05:36.280 --> 05:41.680
Okay. If AX squared plus 
 BX plus C equals zero

05:41.680 --> 05:45.680
then X equals minus B plus/minus 
 the square root of B squared

05:45.680 --> 05:49.080
minus 4AC over what?

05:49.080 --> 05:52.920
Okay. 
 How about Alexandra Mack?

06:01.760 --> 06:04.640
[Vince] 
 You're the best we have?

06:06.440 --> 06:08.160
Maybe. 
 [chuckles]

06:09.040 --> 06:11.320
Mind if I grab some lunch on the way?

06:11.320 --> 06:14.560
The testing facility is 
 expecting the shipment now.

06:14.560 --> 06:18.000
You can get your lunch after 
 you've made the delivery.

06:18.000 --> 06:21.280
Okay. 
 But I'm really pretty hungry.

06:21.280 --> 06:24.200
Hey! This is important. 
 Your lunch can wait.

06:24.200 --> 06:29.120
And take back roads. 
 No stopping. No nothing.

06:29.120 --> 06:31.040
Do you understand?

06:31.040 --> 06:33.000
Yeah... which part?

06:38.880 --> 06:41.160
[Alex] It was worse than 
 I thought it would be.

06:41.160 --> 06:44.120
I got shoved in a locker, 
 I ripped my class schedule

06:44.360 --> 06:47.160
- and everyone here hates me. 
 - [Raymond] I like you.

06:47.160 --> 06:48.600
No offense, Ray

06:48.600 --> 06:51.600
but I'm going need more 
 than you to survive here.

06:51.600 --> 06:54.120
I'd say I'm sinking. 
 Let's just go home.

06:54.120 --> 06:56.200
- No can do. Band tryouts. 
 - Band tryouts?

06:56.200 --> 07:02.600
- You're going to join the band? 
 - I have to try. You know my dad.

07:02.600 --> 07:05.360
The alvarados always play 
 in the school band.

07:05.360 --> 07:07.920
I can't break that tradition.

07:07.920 --> 07:11.400
Besides, maybe 
 I'll meet some girls.

07:11.400 --> 07:14.560
- Well, I'm a girl. 
 - Girl type girls, Alex.

07:14.560 --> 07:17.120
Oh... girl-type girls.

07:17.120 --> 07:19.720
I'll come over later.

07:19.720 --> 07:22.000
See you.

07:22.000 --> 07:24.080
[Girl] 
 Get out of the way!

07:26.000 --> 07:28.320
Why don't you watch 
 where you are going?

07:28.320 --> 07:31.080
Yo, check out her lunch box.

07:32.480 --> 07:34.320
Hey, what are you guys 
 doing to her?

07:34.320 --> 07:37.440
Scott, relax. We're just 
 messing around with her.

07:37.440 --> 07:40.040
Chill out, Jessica, 
 go back to practice.

07:46.600 --> 07:49.040
- First day, huh? 
 - It'll get better.

07:49.040 --> 07:51.600
- I hope so. 
 - What's your name?

07:51.600 --> 07:54.760
Alex. Um, Alexandra.

07:54.760 --> 07:57.360
Hey, Scott, why don't you 
 ask her about trolls.

07:57.360 --> 08:00.440
- She's an expert. 
 - You like trolls?

08:00.440 --> 08:04.080
I, uh... I used to.

08:04.080 --> 08:07.000
But not now. 
 I mean, not anymore.

08:07.000 --> 08:11.240
I'm too old to play with troll dolls, 
 any dolls.

08:11.240 --> 08:14.680
Right. 
 Hey, I'll see you later, okay?

08:19.680 --> 08:23.440
[dance music playing on radio]

08:28.880 --> 08:31.760
I'm such a geek.

08:36.760 --> 08:38.480
[gasps]

08:38.919 --> 08:41.200
[Alex screaming]

08:54.320 --> 08:56.680
[coughing]

09:03.800 --> 09:06.400
Why don't you watch 
 where you're going?

09:07.960 --> 09:10.680
Hey, kid, get back here!

09:19.880 --> 09:20.600
Annie!

09:39.080 --> 09:42.000
[saw buzzing]

10:00.680 --> 10:03.120
[electrical sizzling]

10:14.200 --> 10:16.800
[screaming]

10:27.400 --> 10:29.120
Whoa!

10:30.960 --> 10:34.120
[man] 
 This is a restricted area.

10:43.400 --> 10:47.680
Wow. Tough first day?

10:47.680 --> 10:50.680
Hey, Annie, 
 I was coming home from school.

10:50.680 --> 10:54.560
When this plant truck swerved, 
 almost hitting me.

10:54.560 --> 10:57.680
Then it crashed, bam! 
 Right into a hydrant.

10:57.680 --> 11:01.560
Then this barrel of gold stuff 
 spilled out all over me.

11:01.560 --> 11:02.560
Hmm.

11:03.880 --> 11:06.720
You're not clever enough 
 to make this up.

11:06.720 --> 11:09.960
And just now, 
 without even doing anything

11:09.960 --> 11:13.840
I think I turned on the saw 
 and the electric train set.

11:13.840 --> 11:15.040
What?!

11:15.040 --> 11:16.960
[Vince] 
 Some kid stepped into the road

11:16.960 --> 11:18.640
and he had to swerved 
 to avoid him.

11:18.640 --> 11:21.520
- Him? 
 - Or her.

11:21.520 --> 11:23.360
He didn't get a good look.

11:23.360 --> 11:26.000
I've kept the police away 
 from here so far.

11:26.000 --> 11:28.360
This is an absolute disaster!

11:28.360 --> 11:30.640
There's another piece of news 
 you won't like.

11:30.640 --> 11:34.280
He says that when the GC-161 
 spilled out of the truck

11:34.280 --> 11:37.720
- it covered the kid from head to toe. 
 - What?

11:37.720 --> 11:39.400
I'm afraid so.

11:39.400 --> 11:42.920
But we found a handprint 
 in the mud near the accident.

11:42.920 --> 11:45.680
And I'm hoping to match 
 the kid up to it.

11:45.680 --> 11:49.040
Vince, I know nothing about GC-161

11:49.040 --> 11:54.080
I know nothing about this accident 
 and I know nothing about his kid

11:54.080 --> 11:56.960
until you find him 
 and bring him to me.

11:56.960 --> 11:58.160
I'll deal with it.

11:58.160 --> 12:00.360
Like you dealt with this?

12:01.360 --> 12:04.880
Your blood pressure and 
 body temperature are normal.

12:04.880 --> 12:08.320
- How do you feel? 
 - My arms and legs are all tingly.

12:08.320 --> 12:09.960
What do you think it is?

12:09.960 --> 12:11.640
I don't know, 
 it could be nothing.

12:11.640 --> 12:14.680
- So I shouldn't worry? 
 - Of course, you should worry.

12:14.680 --> 12:17.480
for all we know you could 
 have been hit by something

12:17.480 --> 12:20.840
that's seeping into your 
 brain cells at this very minute

12:20.840 --> 12:23.480
and it's attacking 
 your central nervous system

12:23.480 --> 12:26.920
and you're going to turn into 
 a quivering mass of jelly.

12:28.160 --> 12:30.800
Whoa! 
 What happened to you?

12:30.800 --> 12:35.120
- Alex was involed in a little accident. 
 - An accidnet?

12:35.120 --> 12:38.520
- You mean the one near the school. 
 - You know about that?

12:38.520 --> 12:41.560
I just came from there. 
 The place is going nuts.

12:41.560 --> 12:43.840
Okay. 
 So we all just need to relax.

12:43.840 --> 12:46.760
Because Alex is glowing a little. 
 No big deal.

12:46.760 --> 12:49.520
No big deal? No big deal?!

12:49.520 --> 12:51.280
Look at her!

12:58.160 --> 13:00.040
Annette Wayne.

13:04.000 --> 13:06.200
Neil Kensella.

13:10.480 --> 13:12.840
Johnny Yelman.

13:14.360 --> 13:17.280
Ah, come on, pal. 
 Give me something.

13:17.280 --> 13:20.440
You were the only one 
 who was there.

13:20.440 --> 13:23.320
I told you, Vince, 
 I didn't get a good look.

13:23.320 --> 13:27.960
It all happened so fast. 
 Well, we know the kid was either

13:27.960 --> 13:30.480
from the Junior High 
 or the High School.

13:30.480 --> 13:33.160
and was headed home on foot.

13:33.160 --> 13:36.240
When the boys in the lab bring 
 down the handprint I.D. unit

13:36.240 --> 13:38.480
we'll get going door-to-door.

13:40.440 --> 13:42.600
I'll find this kid.

13:42.600 --> 13:45.600
Can we grab a bite before we start?

13:47.520 --> 13:48.960
[sighs]

13:48.960 --> 13:52.720
[Annie] I get the feeling this was 
 not just some minor accident.

13:52.720 --> 13:55.560
Those plant security guys 
 were out there.

13:55.560 --> 13:57.920
This has got to be something big.

13:57.920 --> 13:59.360
It wasn't my fault.

13:59.360 --> 14:02.440
They'll blame you. 
 Adults always do.

14:02.440 --> 14:05.360
He's right. 
 We can't tell anyone

14:05.360 --> 14:08.240
until this whole thing dies down.

14:08.240 --> 14:11.880
I'm really hungry. 
 Ray, can I have some chips?

14:11.880 --> 14:15.120
How can you think of 
 eating at a time like this?

14:16.360 --> 14:18.080
Wow!

14:22.560 --> 14:24.720
- Hi, honey. 
 - Hi.

14:24.720 --> 14:26.640
How was your day?

14:27.280 --> 14:29.840
Good, good. 
 At the end of the day

14:29.840 --> 14:33.480
they announced some kind 
 of major security alert.

14:33.480 --> 14:38.680
Did the kids mention anything 
 about a truck accident near school?

14:38.680 --> 14:40.640
I haven't even seen the girls.

14:40.640 --> 14:43.680
Maybe they're out back. 
 I'll go check.

14:43.680 --> 14:45.640
[glass clatters]

14:47.280 --> 14:49.280
Well, you're not glowing anymore.

14:49.280 --> 14:51.720
You're starting to look 
 like yourself again.

14:51.720 --> 14:54.120
Maybe it was just a 
 temporary thing, huh?

14:54.120 --> 14:55.880
Yeah, maybe.

15:00.960 --> 15:02.640
Where did Alex go?

15:06.320 --> 15:08.240
[gurgling]

15:08.240 --> 15:13.880
Ray? 
 Uh... I think that's her!

15:13.880 --> 15:17.720
Yeah, right. 
 Stop it, Annie, really.

15:27.200 --> 15:29.120
[Alex's voice echoing] 
 What's happening?

15:29.120 --> 15:32.720
- Make her stop, Annie! 
 - Alex, stop chasing him.

15:32.720 --> 15:35.160
- [knocking on door] 
 - [Dad] Kids, are you in there?

15:35.160 --> 15:37.400
[Annie] 
 Alex? Hide!

15:37.400 --> 15:39.920
Go find a place. 
 Ray... don't say a word.

15:39.920 --> 15:41.560
Right.

15:42.280 --> 15:44.520
Oh! Hi, Dad. What's up?

15:44.520 --> 15:46.240
Hi, Annie, am I glad to see you.

15:46.240 --> 15:47.880
Hey, Ray.

15:48.480 --> 15:50.880
- Have you kids seen Alex? 
 - Alex? No.

15:50.880 --> 15:52.400
She stayed late after school

15:52.400 --> 15:54.680
to try out for the basketball team. 
 Right, Ray?

15:54.680 --> 15:55.400
Right.

15:56.720 --> 15:59.000
I didn't know she liked basketball.

15:59.000 --> 16:01.360
Neither did I. 
 She's full of surprises lately.

16:01.360 --> 16:04.240
Well, as long as you 
 know where she is.

16:05.240 --> 16:07.600
Uh, what's Raymond 
 doing here without her?

16:07.600 --> 16:10.280
Oh, he's helping me 
 with a new science project.

16:10.280 --> 16:12.800
I'm trying to adjust 
 his molecular structure

16:12.800 --> 16:15.280
to change him into a human puddle.

16:17.760 --> 16:20.360
As long as you clean up 
 the mess afterwards.

16:26.560 --> 16:28.040
Okay.

16:29.280 --> 16:31.400
Alex, come out.

16:37.760 --> 16:41.920
Annie! 
 Bring me my clothes.

16:43.560 --> 16:44.360
[sirens blaring]

16:47.840 --> 16:49.680
[sirens continuing]

16:51.280 --> 16:53.800
I don't know, Annie. 
 Maybe I should tell Dad.

16:53.800 --> 16:57.480
He can take me to the plant 
 and they can give me an antidote.

16:57.480 --> 17:01.960
No, no way. My guess is 
 that whatever doused you

17:01.960 --> 17:05.079
is illegal and majorly top secret.

17:05.079 --> 17:08.000
And if you go public, 
 Dad could lose his job.

17:08.000 --> 17:10.280
- Or worse. 
 - Worse?

17:10.280 --> 17:12.880
I'd say Danielle Atron 
 and her security guys

17:12.880 --> 17:15.280
never let you see 
 the light of day again.

17:15.280 --> 17:18.079
They're going to cut you up 
 put you under a microscope

17:18.079 --> 17:20.720
and examine you like 
 a frog in biology class.

17:20.720 --> 17:23.720
I bet your brain'll end up 
 in a jar of formaldehyde.

17:23.720 --> 17:27.880
Ray, go back to the accident site 
 and see what you can find.

17:28.240 --> 17:29.840
Right.

17:40.240 --> 17:43.120
We do this block and 
 then another three.

17:43.120 --> 17:46.640
I want to cover this entire 
 neighborhood by nightfall.

17:46.640 --> 17:48.120
Don't worry, Vince.

17:48.120 --> 17:52.520
Even if I don't recognise the kid 
 he'll probably recognize me.

17:54.960 --> 17:57.000
[Vince] 
 All we need is for the kid

17:57.000 --> 18:01.960
to stick his hand in this handprint 
 I.D unit and we'll nail him.

18:01.960 --> 18:04.200
[Vince chuckling]

18:08.200 --> 18:10.640
- [knocking on door] 
 - What's wrong?

18:10.640 --> 18:12.640
Plant security is going door-to-door.

18:12.640 --> 18:16.440
They have this thing you stick 
 your hand in that can identify you.

18:16.440 --> 18:19.600
- You're in big trouble. 
 - If they see me like this, I'm dead.

18:19.600 --> 18:22.880
you two, calm down. 
 We'll make sure they don't find you.

18:22.880 --> 18:25.280
- Let's go chance your clothes. 
 - Okay.

18:25.280 --> 18:27.040
Well, you can forget that.

18:27.040 --> 18:30.720
They're heading for 
 your house right now.

18:30.720 --> 18:33.360
Alex... you're going to 
 have to liguify again.

18:33.360 --> 18:36.040
This time, maybe if you 
 concentrate harder

18:36.040 --> 18:37.960
you can transform 
 your clothes, too.

18:37.960 --> 18:39.960
But what if I can't reform again?

18:39.960 --> 18:43.320
And I'm destined to live 
 the rest of my life as a... puddle.

18:43.320 --> 18:45.920
Would that be such a loss? 
 I'm just kidding.

18:45.920 --> 18:48.040
Look, you did it once, 
 you can do it again.

18:48.040 --> 18:50.120
Ray. Ray!

18:50.120 --> 18:52.520
Go home and if they 
 come to your house

18:52.520 --> 18:55.320
just try not to say 
 anything too stupid.

19:02.320 --> 19:05.200
Ready? Go for it.

19:07.480 --> 19:09.400
Give me a sec, then follow me.

19:16.160 --> 19:19.520
Sorry, Alex. 
 That... won't work.

19:19.520 --> 19:24.480
[Alex's voice eching] Oh, no, 
 now what am I supposed to do?

19:24.480 --> 19:27.720
You're going to have to 
 go through the plumbing.

19:27.720 --> 19:30.360
- The plumbing? No way! 
 - You've got no choice.

19:30.360 --> 19:33.440
Somehow you've got to 
 get to the upstairs bathroom.

19:33.440 --> 19:34.560
[doorbell ringing]

19:34.560 --> 19:37.080
Is that all you have to say to me?

19:37.360 --> 19:38.960
Good luck!

19:40.080 --> 19:42.880
- [doorbell ringing] 
 - Oh, Mom, I'll get it.

19:42.880 --> 19:44.520
Thanks.

19:46.880 --> 19:49.920
Oh, Annie? This is Vince 
 and Dave from the plant

19:49.920 --> 19:53.360
and they just want to 
 ask you a couple of questions.

19:53.360 --> 19:54.680
Sweetheart.

19:54.680 --> 19:58.040
Do you know where you were 
 at 3:00 this afternoon?

19:58.040 --> 20:01.000
"Sweetheart?" 
 I don't even know you.

20:02.320 --> 20:04.440
I, uh... apologize.

20:04.440 --> 20:07.040
I was in my advanced 
 placement chemistry class

20:07.040 --> 20:09.120
working on a gravity 
 waves experiment.

20:09.120 --> 20:12.600
[gurgling, wailing]

20:12.600 --> 20:14.320
And your other daughter?

20:14.320 --> 20:17.240
Well, I haven't seen her. 
 She stayed late at school.

20:17.240 --> 20:20.040
- She ought to be home by now. 
 - I saw her, Dad.

20:20.040 --> 20:22.480
She said she was 
 going to go upstairs.

20:22.480 --> 20:24.280
[gurgling, screaming]

20:24.280 --> 20:25.560
Well, why don't we check on that?

20:25.560 --> 20:27.240
Wait, guys, 
 she's my daughter.

20:27.240 --> 20:29.400
I'll go-- if she's there 
 I'll bring her down.

20:29.400 --> 20:31.600
You do that.

20:35.360 --> 20:38.480
[gurgling]

20:40.760 --> 20:43.960
Alex? Are you there?

20:43.960 --> 20:46.000
[knocking]

20:46.240 --> 20:49.360
Alex? 
 Well, here you are.

20:49.360 --> 20:53.640
- I didn't see you come in. 
 - I said "hi," I thought you heard me.

20:53.640 --> 20:56.840
Do you know anything about 
 an accident near school today?

20:56.840 --> 20:59.440
An accident? Nope.

20:59.440 --> 21:01.480
Good. 
 I need you downstairs

21:01.480 --> 21:03.880
to tell a couple of people that.

21:06.280 --> 21:08.880
I was upstairs doing my homework.

21:08.880 --> 21:11.560
That should do it, 
 so if you don't mind...

21:11.560 --> 21:13.200
we'd like to eat our dinner.

21:13.200 --> 21:16.440
After the girls have their 
 handprints recorded, Mr. Mack.

21:16.440 --> 21:19.800
So that we know 
 they've been checked out.

21:31.880 --> 21:33.880
And now the younger one.

21:37.640 --> 21:38.360
Go on.

21:43.640 --> 21:46.160
- [metallic rattling] 
 - Oh, no! I'm sorry.

21:46.160 --> 21:48.480
We have another one in the car.

21:52.240 --> 21:55.920
Excuse me? 
 Is that your vehicle rolling away?

22:05.520 --> 22:07.280
I'm really worried, Annie.

22:07.280 --> 22:10.000
The plant won't stop 
 until they find me.

22:10.000 --> 22:14.640
Between my brains and your 
 powers that won't be too easy.

22:14.640 --> 22:19.400
Everything has changed, Alex. 
 You were just this average kid

22:19.400 --> 22:23.520
headed for this life of 
 inconsequence and boredom.

22:23.520 --> 22:25.200
And now, look at you.

22:25.200 --> 22:26.680
I can tell you one thing.

22:26.680 --> 22:30.680
My second day of Junior High 
 will be a lot different than my first.

22:30.680 --> 22:34.080
I bet we make the cover 
 of scientific America one day.

22:34.080 --> 22:36.960
You would have made it 
 by yourself, eventually.

22:36.960 --> 22:40.480
Don't worry, 
 I'll take all the credit.

22:40.480 --> 22:43.040
Goodnight, Alex.

22:43.800 --> 22:45.680
Goodnight, Annie.

22:45.680 --> 22:47.640
[zapping]

22:49.560 --> 22:52.400
- Alex! 
 - [Alex giggling]

22:52.400 --> 22:56.400
[burglar alarm sounding]

22:56.400 --> 23:02.040
- [dog barking] 
 - [many burglar alarms sounding]

23:02.040 --> 23:07.520
[burglar alarms continuing]

23:09.000 --> 23:13.360
Have a good night's sleep, kid. 
 You won't have many more.

23:13.360 --> 23:16.680
You've slipped through 
 my fingers for now.

23:16.680 --> 23:19.120
But tomorrow is another day.
