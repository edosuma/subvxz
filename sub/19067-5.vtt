01:06.233 --> 01:08.151
[alarm blaring]

01:08.235 --> 01:10.737
Zarkon! How did he find us?

01:10.821 --> 01:13.156
His commanders must have
radioed him from Olkarion.

01:13.240 --> 01:16.159
We need to wormhole, now!
Everyone to your stations.

01:16.243 --> 01:18.537
We've got to put some distance
between us and Zarkon.

01:18.620 --> 01:20.914
-This could be the fight of our lives.
-[groans]

01:23.417 --> 01:25.085
[Hunk]
<i>That's sure a lot of fighters.</i>

01:26.169 --> 01:28.088
Allura, can you evade these fighters?

01:28.171 --> 01:30.215
We can't have them following us
through the wormhole.

01:30.299 --> 01:31.341
I can try.

01:38.056 --> 01:41.018
[Shiro] <i>Keith, Lance,</i>
<i>let's lay down some covering fire.</i>

01:48.859 --> 01:49.693
[grunts]

01:52.112 --> 01:54.406
Lance, incoming, 12 o'clock high!

01:54.489 --> 01:55.532
[Lance] <i>Got it!</i>

01:57.451 --> 01:59.828
<i>-Hey!</i>
-[Keith] <i>Sorry! Gotta be quick!</i>

01:59.911 --> 02:02.372
<i>-How's that for quick?</i>
<i>-You...</i>

02:03.582 --> 02:05.917
Knock it off, you two!
Stay in your zones!

02:06.001 --> 02:08.669
-Yeah, Keith!
-Keep calling out those fighters, Pidge.

02:08.753 --> 02:10.714
Hunk, how are the defenses holding?

02:10.797 --> 02:13.091
I don't know.
Ten percent? Fifteen maybe?

02:13.175 --> 02:16.011
Everything's a blur.
I've been up too long. I have tired eyes!

02:16.094 --> 02:18.055
I know we just came off an intense battle,

02:18.138 --> 02:20.474
but we've got to stay focused,
just until we jump.

02:20.557 --> 02:22.017
[Keith]
<i>And when is that?</i>

02:22.100 --> 02:25.062
[Coran] <i>They're still too close!</i>
<i>We need to gain more speed!</i>

02:25.979 --> 02:28.273
-I've got an idea! Hold on!
-[grunts]

02:30.525 --> 02:32.694
[Pidge]
<i>Allura, what are you doing?</i>

02:32.778 --> 02:34.363
I'm going to use this moon's gravity

02:34.446 --> 02:37.115
to gain speed and put some distance
between us and Zarkon.

02:42.120 --> 02:46.291
[all grunting]

02:47.209 --> 02:49.211
We're clear to wormhole!

03:09.523 --> 03:11.900
[Lance] We got away from Zarkon,
how come we're still on alert?

03:11.983 --> 03:16.363
-[Shiro] Coran, what's going on?
-Oh, no! Teludav lens malfunction!

03:16.446 --> 03:19.199
We're about to exit this wormhole
a lot sooner than we planned!

03:25.080 --> 03:29.626
[Lance] <i>Whoa. Where are we?</i>
<i>Looks like some sort of iceberg graveyard.</i>

03:29.709 --> 03:33.213
-Coran, what's the status?
-[Coran] Checking that now.

03:33.296 --> 03:34.798
We didn't make it to our exit point,

03:34.881 --> 03:37.134
but we're several galaxies
from Zarkon's fleet.

03:37.217 --> 03:39.594
-Allura!
-[all] Allura!

03:41.513 --> 03:43.140
[Coran]
Oh, no, you look exhausted.

03:43.223 --> 03:46.476
You must rest. You've been
exerting way too much energy.

03:46.560 --> 03:49.271
I'll go check on the main turbine
and figure out what's going--

03:49.354 --> 03:50.689
[screaming]

03:50.772 --> 03:52.023
Whoa! Are you all right?

03:52.733 --> 03:53.817
[groans]

03:54.985 --> 03:56.111
I'm fine.

03:56.194 --> 03:59.406
Look, I tell you what, I've probably hit
a slippery spot on the ground there.

03:59.489 --> 04:02.701
Someone please wipe that up there!

04:04.035 --> 04:07.038
You're sweating. You might have
a case of the slipperies.

04:07.706 --> 04:12.502
What? No! No, that's an old person virus,
and I'm not old. I'm young.

04:12.586 --> 04:14.296
Well, young-ish.

04:14.379 --> 04:15.881
What are the slipperies?

04:15.964 --> 04:19.968
It's a common Altean virus
that occurs later in life.

04:20.051 --> 04:23.555
It's not harmful and usually
only lasts a couple of days,

04:23.638 --> 04:27.893
but it causes one's body
to secrete extremely slick fluid.

04:27.976 --> 04:29.394
-Ew!
-Gross!

04:29.478 --> 04:32.647
Yes, it is gross,
so it's a good thing I don't have it!

04:32.731 --> 04:35.233
Coran, it's nothing
to be embarrassed about.

04:35.317 --> 04:38.069
I'm not embarrassed
because I don't have it!

04:38.153 --> 04:42.032
And, now, I'm actually going to leave
because I've got to fix the main turbine!

04:42.908 --> 04:45.994
[whimpering, screaming]

04:46.870 --> 04:48.079
<i>Quiznak!</i>

04:48.163 --> 04:49.539
[screaming]

04:52.459 --> 04:54.878
All right. Since Zarkon has
no idea where we are,

04:54.961 --> 04:57.631
this is the perfect time
to focus on our next step.

04:57.714 --> 05:00.759
Maybe we can find that secret group,
the Blade of Marmora.

05:00.842 --> 05:04.721
-Pidge, where are those coordinates?
-[groans] Wait, hang on.

05:04.805 --> 05:08.350
-I'm so tired, my brain's not working.
-Yeah, neither is mine.

05:08.433 --> 05:10.477
[Coran] <i>Hello, all.</i>
<i>I've checked the engines.</i>

05:10.560 --> 05:11.561
That was fast.

05:11.645 --> 05:14.606
<i>Well, I slipped right down-- </i> [groans]
<i>I mean, hurried down.</i>

05:14.689 --> 05:17.651
<i>Anyway, the good news is,</i>
<i>the Galra fighter did minimal damage.</i>

05:17.734 --> 05:19.569
<i>I flushed the turbine and it's fine.</i>

05:19.653 --> 05:21.112
The bad news is, the teludav,

05:21.196 --> 05:24.533
or wormholer, as you Earthlings
call it, is in bad shape.

05:24.616 --> 05:26.201
<i>Several scaultrite lens-stones</i>

05:26.284 --> 05:28.787
<i>of the magnifying beam</i>
<i>generator are cracked.</i>

05:28.870 --> 05:31.414
<i>As you know, the magnifying</i>
<i>beam generator uses a crystal</i>

05:31.498 --> 05:34.417
<i>to convert Altean energy</i>
<i>into usable fuel.</i>

05:34.501 --> 05:37.087
<i>That supplies the power</i>
<i>needed to wormhole.</i>

05:37.170 --> 05:39.506
<i>Well, anyway, I need</i>
<i>to remove the cracked lenses</i>

05:39.589 --> 05:43.426
<i>and readjust their trajectory temporarily</i>
<i>until we can replace them.</i>

05:43.510 --> 05:46.763
<i>I'll also need to divert power</i>
<i>to make up for the lost energy.</i>

05:46.846 --> 05:49.849
<i>Anyway, it's going to take</i>
<i>at least a quintant.</i>

05:49.933 --> 05:52.269
All right. We'll hide the ship
and get some rest

05:52.352 --> 05:53.979
while Coran comes up
with a work-around.

05:54.062 --> 05:56.565
Tomorrow, we'll be sharper and refocused.

06:07.701 --> 06:08.827
Huh?

06:10.620 --> 06:12.664
What the heck do you think you're doing?

06:12.747 --> 06:15.542
Allura said there's a pool.
I'm gonna go check it out.

06:15.625 --> 06:18.253
-What do you think you're doing?
-[sighs] Same thing.

06:19.629 --> 06:23.008
Look, you stay on one side of the pool
and I'll stay on the other,

06:23.091 --> 06:25.802
and we'll be far, far away
from each other.

06:25.885 --> 06:28.555
Very... far... away.

06:30.640 --> 06:32.851
[Keith] Hm?
[Lance] Uh...

06:34.894 --> 06:36.771
[both sigh]

06:40.358 --> 06:43.403
I thought you were exhausted.
Why are you making cookies?

06:43.486 --> 06:46.448
Because baking clears
my head, Pidge. Okay?

06:46.531 --> 06:48.575
I thought you were gonna help Coran
with the wormholer.

06:48.658 --> 06:52.203
One mention of the slipperies and he got
all sensitive and kicked me out.

06:52.287 --> 06:55.040
I hate not being able to read Altean.
What is this stuff?

06:55.123 --> 06:56.666
Are you sure you're making food?

06:56.750 --> 06:59.919
You're gonna try and tell me
that these aren't cookies?

07:01.630 --> 07:03.256
[groans]

07:04.507 --> 07:07.844
Okay, I might have overcooked them.

07:07.927 --> 07:11.097
Wait, where you going?
You don't want to wait for the next batch?

07:11.181 --> 07:15.435
[grunting]

07:17.354 --> 07:19.481
[straining]

07:24.653 --> 07:27.697
It's right, then left. You're off.

07:27.781 --> 07:31.576
-You're off! And shoving too hard!
-You're not shoving hard enough!

07:33.161 --> 07:37.248
-I should be at the pool right now!
-Would you stop whining?

07:37.916 --> 07:39.376
Huh?

07:39.459 --> 07:40.418
-Look!
-Huh?

07:51.221 --> 07:53.556
[screaming]

07:53.640 --> 07:56.685
[both screaming]

07:57.352 --> 07:58.478
[both groan]

07:58.561 --> 08:00.855
-[grunting]
-Huh?

08:02.357 --> 08:06.444
[Lance] What the heck?
[Keith] Stupid Altean pools.

08:07.112 --> 08:09.406
[computer]
<i>Welcome to introductory Altean.</i>

08:09.489 --> 08:12.617
Awesome! I'm finally gonna
learn the Altean language!

08:12.701 --> 08:15.745
<i>Level, beginner. Safety, off.</i>

08:15.829 --> 08:18.206
Safety? That's weird.

08:24.212 --> 08:26.047
<i>Klanm端irl.</i>

08:27.298 --> 08:28.717
Klan-mural.

08:28.800 --> 08:31.469
-[beeping]
-Hm? Uh, what's that?

08:33.179 --> 08:35.265
<i>-Klanm端irl.</i>
-[growling]

08:35.347 --> 08:37.600
Klan-mirl?
[screaming]

08:39.561 --> 08:40.602
[roars]

08:40.687 --> 08:44.524
<i>-Klanm端irl! Klanm端irl!</i>
-[beeping]

08:48.903 --> 08:49.738
[sighs]

08:51.281 --> 08:52.365
Huh?

08:57.954 --> 09:00.749
<i>Xznly Squiwl.</i>

09:00.832 --> 09:02.417
Oh, <i>quiznak.</i>

09:06.004 --> 09:08.173
What are you doing here?
You should be resting.

09:08.256 --> 09:12.635
I cannot sleep. Zarkon is out there.
He's searching for us.

09:12.719 --> 09:15.722
I know how you feel,
but you have to step away for a while.

09:15.805 --> 09:17.974
It's what's best for everyone.

09:18.475 --> 09:19.392
[both gasp]

09:19.476 --> 09:21.144
[alarm blaring]

09:32.322 --> 09:36.409
We are several galaxies away.
How could they find us so soon?

09:37.869 --> 09:39.913
Oh, no! My good batch!

09:39.996 --> 09:42.082
[yelps, groans]

09:42.165 --> 09:44.584
[gurgling]

09:45.418 --> 09:47.003
-[screaming]
-[groaning]

09:47.670 --> 09:49.339
[grunting]

09:50.632 --> 09:51.716
Huh?

09:51.800 --> 09:53.927
[Allura]
<i>Particle barrier up!</i>

09:55.470 --> 09:58.681
-Coran, are you there?
-<i>I'm here! </i> [screams]

09:58.765 --> 10:02.102
-<i>Over here! Whoa, whoa, whoa!</i>
-Zarkon is back! What's our status?

10:02.185 --> 10:05.772
<i>Wormholing will be a problem.</i>
<i>The lenses haven't been readjusted!</i>

10:05.855 --> 10:08.108
<i>I don't know if the teludav</i>
<i>will generate enough power.</i>

10:08.191 --> 10:11.152
-Do everything you can!
-They found us again?

10:11.236 --> 10:14.239
How is that possible? Is that possible?
That doesn't seem possible!

10:14.322 --> 10:15.573
[grunts]

10:15.657 --> 10:18.409
Right now, we must figure out
a way to get out of here.

10:18.493 --> 10:21.538
Or we can stay and fight.
Now's our chance.

10:21.621 --> 10:23.665
Form Voltron. Enough running!

10:23.748 --> 10:25.416
It's too dangerous!

10:25.500 --> 10:28.795
Allura's right. We can't take on Zarkon
and his entire fleet.

10:28.878 --> 10:31.089
Remember what happened
at Zarkon's command center.

10:31.172 --> 10:34.425
We wouldn't have escaped if the Blade
of Marmora hadn't shut down the shield.

10:34.509 --> 10:37.220
<i>The turbine's up. Still working</i>
<i>on the worm--</i> [screams]

10:37.303 --> 10:40.473
[groans, screams]

10:41.391 --> 10:42.684
Uh, guys,

10:42.767 --> 10:46.479
I think I'm realizing now that I do,
in fact, have a case of the slipperies.

10:46.563 --> 10:50.233
I'm sorry I yelled at you, Pidge.
I may need your help, after all.

10:50.316 --> 10:52.652
<i>-I'm coming down.</i>
-[Shiro] <i>Let's clear a path.</i>

11:02.745 --> 11:04.831
[Keith] <i>Lance, there's a fighter</i>
<i>advancing on your nine!</i>

11:04.914 --> 11:08.084
Thanks for the heads-up! And you've
got one going for the lower barrier.

11:08.168 --> 11:09.419
[Keith]
<i>Good eye!</i>

11:09.502 --> 11:10.712
What can I do?

11:10.795 --> 11:13.214
Help me divert power.
Slide me to that monitor!

11:13.298 --> 11:15.341
-Wipe my sweat!
-[grunting]

11:18.970 --> 11:20.805
Okay, buddy, you're mine.

11:20.889 --> 11:23.641
What's going on?
I lost control of my defense drone!

11:23.725 --> 11:28.646
I got you covered! Uh, I don't got you.
Oh, there must be a system failure.

11:28.730 --> 11:29.981
<i>-Nope, that was us!</i>
-[Coran screaming]

11:30.064 --> 11:31.900
<i>We're diverting power</i>
<i>from non-essential systems</i>

11:31.983 --> 11:33.651
<i>to get the wormhole generator working.</i>

11:33.735 --> 11:35.904
Shooting bad guys is pretty essential!

11:35.987 --> 11:38.531
[Hunk] <i>We lost secondary controls!</i>
<i>Thermal regulator's offline!</i>

11:38.615 --> 11:40.825
<i>Oh, no, there goes the particle barrier!</i>

11:41.951 --> 11:46.289
Okay, try it! We should be able
to make one very small jump... I hope.

11:51.836 --> 11:54.380
[Pidge] Is it gonna hold?
[Coran] I guess we're about to find out.

11:56.591 --> 11:57.759
The wormhole's open!

12:05.600 --> 12:08.478
Oh, no! The lenses are
breaking down even more!

12:08.561 --> 12:11.147
We'll be out of the wormhole
even sooner this time!

12:27.830 --> 12:29.332
[Shiro]
Zarkon keeps finding us.

12:30.833 --> 12:33.836
It's like he knows how to track us down.

12:33.920 --> 12:36.172
Maybe he planted
some kind of tracking device.

12:37.298 --> 12:38.883
Well, it is nothing on the ship.

12:38.967 --> 12:41.219
The Castle would have detected
any tracking devices.

12:41.302 --> 12:43.513
Until we figure out
exactly how he's doing it,

12:43.596 --> 12:46.057
we should assume
that he could show up at any minute.

12:46.140 --> 12:47.976
-So, stay alert.
-[snoring]

12:49.560 --> 12:52.981
Oh, man! Oh, what's going on? What are
you guys doing? What are you looking at?

12:53.064 --> 12:56.234
-You woke yourself up snoring.
-My bad.

12:57.068 --> 13:00.655
-Coran, what's our status? Any good news?
-<i>Actually, there is a bit of good news.</i>

13:00.738 --> 13:02.824
<i>I'm finally getting used</i>
<i>to these slipperies.</i>

13:02.907 --> 13:05.660
<i>My mucus glands are working</i>
<i>at an incredible rate!</i>

13:06.285 --> 13:08.579
Any good news about the teludav?

13:08.663 --> 13:12.083
<i>I'm afraid not. The last jump</i>
<i>overloaded the lens-stones.</i>

13:12.166 --> 13:14.127
<i>Now, even more of them are broken.</i>

13:14.210 --> 13:16.921
<i>I'm going to try some readjustments</i>
<i>to change the beam trajectory.</i>

13:17.005 --> 13:19.799
Until then, wormholing away
will be impossible.

13:19.882 --> 13:22.593
Hey, there's a giant metallic storm
ahead of us.

13:22.677 --> 13:24.554
I think we can hide
in the eye of the storm.

13:25.179 --> 13:28.141
<i>It should give off enough interference</i>
<i>so we can't be tracked.</i>

13:28.975 --> 13:30.435
It's worth a shot.

13:52.415 --> 13:53.791
[Allura]
Brilliant, Pidge.

13:53.875 --> 13:57.920
We're essentially invisible to any radar,
radio waves, universal scans,

13:58.004 --> 13:59.547
or any other known technology.

13:59.630 --> 14:01.257
-[alarm blaring]
-[gasps]

14:05.887 --> 14:06.929
No!

14:21.152 --> 14:23.696
Send in the fighters, flush them out.

14:23.780 --> 14:27.950
When they are within range,
I will take control of the Black Lion.

14:36.167 --> 14:37.710
<i>Okay, I don't know how he found us,</i>

14:37.794 --> 14:40.088
<i>but it definitely wasn't</i>
<i>with normal instruments.</i>

14:42.799 --> 14:43.883
It's me.

14:47.220 --> 14:48.930
It's been me all along.

14:49.013 --> 14:51.391
That's how they found us
on planet Arus. [groans]

14:56.229 --> 14:57.355
It doesn't matter, Princess.

14:57.438 --> 14:59.399
We're in this together.
We're gonna get out together.

14:59.482 --> 15:01.526
Uh, how? We're trapped.

15:01.609 --> 15:04.821
We need to form Voltron
and go through the storm.

15:04.904 --> 15:07.240
The storm? What are you, nuts?

15:07.323 --> 15:10.410
Yeah! [stammering] What do you mean?
Yeah, why would we do that?

15:10.493 --> 15:14.205
It's risky, I know,
but it's our only chance.

15:14.288 --> 15:17.166
We have to go through the storm,
then lure Zarkon's ship away,

15:17.250 --> 15:19.752
giving Allura some time
to get into open space.

15:19.836 --> 15:22.255
-Then, what?
-Then, we wormhole away.

15:22.338 --> 15:26.509
Coran, remember how you said getting
this Castle to wormhole is impossible?

15:26.592 --> 15:28.553
Well, I need you to do the impossible.

15:33.307 --> 15:34.517
<i>Form Voltron!</i>

15:58.166 --> 15:59.000
[roars]

16:10.511 --> 16:12.638
Team, let's draw those fighters out!

16:17.935 --> 16:20.271
[Keith] I think it's working!
They're following us!

16:28.070 --> 16:30.364
-How's it coming, Coran?
-<i>In order for this to work,</i>

16:30.448 --> 16:33.993
each remaining lens-stone will need
to take the equivalent of five beams!

16:34.076 --> 16:36.162
There's no way it can hold
that kind of power!

16:36.245 --> 16:38.039
The whole thing will explode!

16:41.375 --> 16:45.213
-We've lost them in the storm!
-They won't be in there long.

16:48.716 --> 16:52.720
[Keith] They can't follow us
in this storm! It's tearing them apart!

16:54.555 --> 16:55.765
[Hunk]
The debris!

16:55.848 --> 16:58.601
It's gonna tear us apart
if we don't do something!

16:58.684 --> 17:01.062
-Pidge, we're gonna need that shield!
-<i>On it!</i>

17:01.145 --> 17:03.773
-And, Keith, the sword!
-Yes, sir!

17:12.281 --> 17:14.032
[Shiro]
Legs, I need everything you got!

17:14.116 --> 17:17.912
-Roger! Engaging lower thrusters!
-I'm right there with ya!

17:35.638 --> 17:38.391
Get me closer to the Black Lion.

17:38.474 --> 17:42.103
Sire, we have the Princess trapped.
We can finish her now!

17:43.062 --> 17:45.439
The Black Lion is all that matters!

17:52.029 --> 17:53.990
Coran, here we go!

18:01.622 --> 18:03.874
[Hunk]
It worked! They escaped!

18:04.458 --> 18:05.585
[all yelling]

18:05.668 --> 18:07.461
[Keith] What's going on?
[Hunk] My lion!

18:07.545 --> 18:09.880
[groaning]

18:09.964 --> 18:11.090
Zarkon...

18:15.553 --> 18:19.348
[Shiro] Zarkon's taking control
of the Black Lion again! Fall back!

18:21.350 --> 18:22.602
[grunting]

18:35.281 --> 18:37.325
[Haggar screaming]

18:37.408 --> 18:38.993
[screams]

18:45.166 --> 18:47.835
Paladins, now's your chance!
Get out of there!

18:51.839 --> 18:55.760
I forgot how intense Zarkon's
connection to the Black Lion is.

18:55.843 --> 18:58.971
We have to keep our distance,
or risk losing Voltron.

18:59.055 --> 19:01.265
Let's disband and get back to the Castle.

19:05.227 --> 19:07.146
[growls]

19:07.229 --> 19:12.401
Attack that Castle with everything
we've got! Capture Voltron!

19:17.156 --> 19:18.783
Why haven't we wormholed yet?

19:18.866 --> 19:22.078
Because we can't! We're missing
several scaultrite lens-stones!

19:22.161 --> 19:24.580
They've shattered! Gone! Don't exist!

19:24.664 --> 19:26.123
<i>Sloven-day-ho!</i>

19:26.207 --> 19:27.375
That's Altean for "gone."

19:27.458 --> 19:31.754
Wait, did you say "scaultrite"?
I've seen that somewhere before.

19:31.837 --> 19:34.715
I think Hunk was making
some terrible cookies from that stuff!

19:35.049 --> 19:36.509
[growls]

19:42.973 --> 19:46.435
Unbelievable! These cookies do have
trace elements of scaultrite.

19:46.519 --> 19:49.313
-Could they work?
-They might be able to hold for one jump,

19:49.397 --> 19:52.358
but we'd still need several people
actually physically holding them.

19:52.441 --> 19:55.069
And, if the trajectories
were calculated just so...

19:55.152 --> 19:59.490
[grunting]

20:00.658 --> 20:03.536
It just warms my heart
that people are enjoying my cookies.

20:03.619 --> 20:06.414
Okay, there.
Now, nobody move if you want to live.

20:07.873 --> 20:09.458
I think I moved! I think I moved!

20:09.542 --> 20:11.585
Well, then move back
to where you think you were!

20:11.669 --> 20:14.672
Okay, now, I'm going to monitor
the beam from out there.

20:14.755 --> 20:16.924
Wait, Coran! How dangerous is this?

20:19.593 --> 20:23.222
Honestly, this is the most dangerous thing
I've ever seen, or heard of,

20:23.305 --> 20:25.015
but since we're probably
going to die anyway,

20:25.099 --> 20:27.226
what the heck, let's give it a shot!

20:27.309 --> 20:31.689
Good luck, gentlemen and gentlelady.
It's been a pleasure.

20:31.772 --> 20:32.815
Don't touch the lasers!

20:35.192 --> 20:36.068
Uh...

20:40.489 --> 20:41.907
<i>They're in position!</i>

20:47.413 --> 20:49.415
We're gonna die! We're gonna die!
We're gonna die!

20:49.498 --> 20:50.916
Hold tight, Lance!

20:55.421 --> 20:58.299
[screaming]
Hm?

20:58.382 --> 20:59.884
It's not working!

20:59.967 --> 21:02.470
<i>Coran, what's happening?</i>
<i>Zarkon's right on top of us!</i>

21:05.556 --> 21:09.643
The stones aren't reflecting properly!
I need something to shine them up!

21:09.727 --> 21:10.561
Oh...

21:12.146 --> 21:16.317
Wait a second. I think I've got it.
Hit the wormhole in ten ticks!

21:16.400 --> 21:18.068
[Allura]
<i>Ten...</i>

21:18.152 --> 21:19.320
-What's happening?
-<i>...nine...</i>

21:19.403 --> 21:22.156
No one move!
I've got to shine these stones!

21:22.239 --> 21:23.908
Good thing I've got
a case of the slipperies!

21:24.742 --> 21:25.659
<i>...six...</i>

21:25.743 --> 21:27.161
five...

21:29.079 --> 21:30.122
<i>four...</i>

21:31.707 --> 21:32.541
three...

21:34.418 --> 21:36.837
<i>-two...</i>
-Huh?

21:36.921 --> 21:38.005
...one!

21:40.049 --> 21:45.346
[all screaming]

21:45.429 --> 21:48.474
[grunting]

21:51.852 --> 21:53.062
[yelling]

21:59.276 --> 22:00.986
[all screaming]

22:18.087 --> 22:21.131
Great work, team! We made it! Huh?

22:21.215 --> 22:24.385
[all groaning]

22:24.468 --> 22:25.636
[yelps]

22:28.639 --> 22:32.977
We were close, sire, but it appears
they were able to make a full jump.

22:33.852 --> 22:38.148
There is no place in this universe
beyond my vision's reach.

22:38.232 --> 22:40.985
Time is on my side.

22:41.068 --> 22:44.196
Set a course for Voltron.
