09:43.291 --> 09:45.042
IF SHE FILMS A BUNCH
OF OLD PEOPLE SPITTING OUT

09:45.126 --> 09:47.461
THIS TASTELESS SLOP
INTO THEIR NAPKINS.

09:47.545 --> 09:49.171
- IT'S NOT SLOP.

09:49.255 --> 09:50.548
I THINK
THE SENIORS WILL LOVE IT.

09:50.631 --> 09:53.676
- MELANIE, THEY'RE
NOT LIKE PEOPLE FROM L.A.

09:53.759 --> 09:58.472
THEY LIVE OPENLY
AS OLD PEOPLE.

09:58.556 --> 10:01.309
AND REAL OLD PEOPLE LIKE
TO PUNCTUATE THEIR NAPS

10:01.392 --> 10:04.228
WITH BACON, AND PIE,
AND WHAT THIS COUNTRY

10:04.312 --> 10:07.982
IS MYSTERIOUSLY PROUD
TO CALL AMERICAN CHEESE.

10:08.065 --> 10:09.358
- WELL,
IT'S GONNA BE DELICIOUS.

10:09.442 --> 10:12.236
NOW STIR IT
BEFORE THE TOFU GETS CLAMMY.

10:34.592 --> 10:36.594
DELICIOUS.

10:38.971 --> 10:40.222
OH, DID YOU KNIT THOSE
FOR MAX?

10:40.306 --> 10:42.266
- YES.
TRY THEM ON, JOY.

10:42.350 --> 10:45.728
YOU'RE THE ONLY ONE HERE
WITH MAN HANDS.

10:45.811 --> 10:48.856
- I DO NOT HAVE MAN-HANDS.

10:50.316 --> 10:52.068
OH, YEAH, THEY DO SEEM
TO FIT PERFECTLY.

10:52.151 --> 10:54.278
- OH, THEY'LL BE
A LITTLE BIG FOR MAX,

10:54.362 --> 10:56.405
BUT THEY'LL DO.

10:58.657 --> 10:59.742
- WHAT'S THAT STUFF?

10:59.825 --> 11:01.118
- IT'S MOCK
MACARONI AND CHEESE.

11:01.202 --> 11:02.578
AND THE BEAUTY OF IT,

11:02.661 --> 11:04.080
THERE'S NO MACARONI
AND NO CHEESE.

11:04.163 --> 11:07.124
- YES, NOTHING
RUINS MACARONI AND CHEESE

11:07.208 --> 11:10.002
LIKE MACARONI AND CHEESE.

11:18.135 --> 11:19.804
- NOW YOU'RE
GETTING WITH THE PROGRAM,

11:19.887 --> 11:21.639
PUTTING SOME
ELBOW GREASE INTO IT.

11:21.722 --> 11:24.767
- ELBOW GREASE.
YES.

11:26.894 --> 11:28.396
- HEY, HOW'D IT GO
WITH THE KIDS?

11:28.479 --> 11:29.939
- OH,
I UNDERESTIMATED THEM.

11:30.022 --> 11:32.608
OH, THEY ARE GOOD ACTORS.
THEY ARE REAL GOOD.

11:32.692 --> 11:35.444
THEY MANAGED TO UNDERMINE ME
EVERY STEP OF THE WAY.

11:35.528 --> 11:38.447
VERY METHOD.

11:38.531 --> 11:40.241
- WELL,
YOU GOT TWO OPTIONS.

11:40.324 --> 11:42.451
YOU EITHER FIND
A WAY TO GET THEM TO LIKE YOU,

11:42.535 --> 11:44.453
OR YOU BREAK UP WITH HIM.

11:44.537 --> 11:46.163
- WAIT.

11:46.247 --> 11:48.124
MAYBE THERE'S A THIRD OPTION.

11:48.207 --> 11:50.126
I HAVE A PLAN.

11:50.209 --> 11:52.962
THE GHOST CHILDREN ON
<i>EDGE OF TOMORROW</i> COULD NOT REST

11:53.045 --> 11:55.840
UNTIL THEY LIVED FULL-TIME
WITH THEIR GHOST MOTHER.

11:57.550 --> 11:59.969
- WELL, WHO CAN ARGUE
WITH A PLAN

12:00.052 --> 12:02.930
THAT STARTS WITH
"THE GHOST CHILDREN"?

12:07.393 --> 12:09.311
- AND WHEN I FOUND OUT
YOU WERE DATING MY EX-HUSBAND,

12:09.395 --> 12:11.856
I THOUGHT, "OH, MY GOD,
I'M SUCH A BIG FAN."

12:11.939 --> 12:13.691
AND THEN HE SAID
YOU WANTED TO MEET ME

12:13.774 --> 12:15.651
AND I FELT SO INTIMIDATED.

12:15.734 --> 12:18.320
- NO, NO,
DON'T FEEL INTIMIDATED.

12:18.404 --> 12:20.823
I MEAN,
SURE, I HAVE AWARDS,

12:20.906 --> 12:22.783
AND MILLIONS
OF ADORING FANS,

12:22.867 --> 12:25.119
AND I HAVE BEEN THE CLUE

12:25.202 --> 12:27.163
IN SEVERAL <i> TV GUIDE</i>
CROSSWORD PUZZLES...

12:27.246 --> 12:30.833
BUT DON'T THINK OF ME
AS "TV'S BLANK CHASE."

12:30.916 --> 12:32.793
JUST THINK OF ME
AS ANOTHER PERSON.

12:32.877 --> 12:35.629
ALMOST LIKE YOU.

12:35.713 --> 12:37.673
- SO WHY DID
YOU WANNA MEET ME?

12:37.756 --> 12:40.718
- BECAUSE I WANTED TO MEET
THE WOMAN WHO RAISED MICHAEL.

12:40.801 --> 12:42.011
- MARCUS.
- AND AMANDA.

12:42.094 --> 12:44.513
- ANNABELLE.
- DELIGHTFUL CHILDREN.

12:44.597 --> 12:47.808
SO...INVENTIVE.

12:47.892 --> 12:51.145
AND THEY LOVE YOU SO MUCH.
THEY CRY FOR YOU, YOU KNOW?

12:51.228 --> 12:53.522
- THEY CRY FOR ME?
- OH, CONSTANTLY.

12:53.606 --> 12:55.399
I MEAN, IT MUST
BE SO DIFFICULT FOR YOU,

12:55.483 --> 12:57.693
SHARING CUSTODY AND KNOWING
HOW MUCH THEY SUFFER

12:57.776 --> 13:00.154
WHEN YOU'RE NOT AROUND.

13:00.237 --> 13:01.363
YOU KNOW, I HAVE
TWO CHILDREN OF MY OWN--

13:01.447 --> 13:04.033
- OH,
I READ YOU HAD THREE.

13:04.116 --> 13:05.201
- I'M AN ARTIST,

13:05.284 --> 13:07.369
SO I'M NOT
VERY GOOD WITH NUMBERS.

13:07.453 --> 13:08.704
THE POINT IS THAT

13:08.787 --> 13:11.499
WHEN A CHILD FALLS
AND SLICES OPEN HIS SHIN,

13:11.582 --> 13:14.835
THE DAD'S WILL SAY,
"OH, WALK IT OFF."

13:14.919 --> 13:16.212
YOU KNOW,
BLOOD GUSHING EVERYWHERE,

13:16.295 --> 13:17.922
"OH, GO RUB
SOME DIRT ON IT."

13:18.005 --> 13:19.673
BUT THAT'S WHY
A MOM NEEDS TO BE THERE

13:19.757 --> 13:23.260
ALL THE TIME WITH--
OH, WHAT IS THE WORD?

13:23.344 --> 13:26.138
FULL CUSTODY.

13:28.641 --> 13:32.061
- 75 IN BOCA, NICE.

13:32.144 --> 13:35.064
75 IN SAINT PETE,
NICE.

13:35.147 --> 13:37.900
UH-OH, IT'S
ONLY 73 IN DELRAY.

13:37.983 --> 13:39.777
POOR BASTARDS.

13:39.860 --> 13:42.238
- YOU'RE MISERABLE HERE,
AREN'T YOU?

13:42.321 --> 13:45.199
- ON THE ONE HAND,
I COULD NEVER BE MISERABLE

13:45.282 --> 13:47.076
WHEN I'M WITH YOU.

13:47.159 --> 13:49.537
ON THE OTHER HAND, YES.

13:49.620 --> 13:53.123
- OH, MAX, I CAN'T
DO THIS TO YOU ANYMORE,

13:53.207 --> 13:55.251
IT'S JUST TOO COLD FOR YOU
IN CLEVELAND.

13:55.334 --> 13:57.419
- SO COME BACK TO FLORIDA
WITH ME.

13:57.503 --> 14:00.506
MY LATE WIFE LOVED IT THERE.
WE HAD SUCH FUN.

14:00.589 --> 14:01.924
AS WE WILL TOO!

14:02.007 --> 14:05.511
- IT'S JUST NOT FOR ME.
BUT YOU GO.

14:05.594 --> 14:07.263
- BUT ELKA--
- NO.

14:07.346 --> 14:09.890
I'M SETTING YOU FREE.

14:09.974 --> 14:12.893
SO...SPREAD YOUR WINGS

14:12.977 --> 14:15.980
AND FLY SOUTH,
MY OLD SNOWBIRD.

14:21.068 --> 14:23.571
- THAT'S SO
SAD AND BEAUTIFUL.

14:23.654 --> 14:26.782
- YOU KNOW, THEY SAY IF
YOU LOVE SOMETHING, SET IT FREE.

14:26.865 --> 14:29.243
BUT I'VE
NEVER UNDERSTOOD THAT.

14:29.326 --> 14:31.829
I SAY IF YOU LOVE SOMETHING,
LOCK IT IN THE BASEMENT

14:31.912 --> 14:33.455
AND FEED IT THROUGH
A SLOT IN THE DOOR

14:33.539 --> 14:36.208
UNTIL IT LOVES YOU BACK.

14:38.711 --> 14:41.005
- ELKA, HE'LL BE BACK
IN THE SPRING.

14:41.088 --> 14:43.632
IT DOES BECOME SPRING HERE
EVENTUALLY, RIGHT?

14:43.716 --> 14:46.093
- SORT OF.

14:46.176 --> 14:48.262
- AND NO MATTER
HOW MANY SUN-DRIED SKANKS

14:48.345 --> 14:50.139
THROW THEMSELVES AT HIM,
HE'LL RESIST.

14:50.222 --> 14:53.642
DON'T YOU WORRY.
- OH, I'M NOT. I MEAN...

14:53.726 --> 14:57.771
WELL, SURE, MAX IS
A CHARMING, HANDSOME MAN,

14:57.855 --> 14:59.815
AND THERE
IS NO WOMAN IN BOCA

14:59.898 --> 15:02.026
WHO WOULDN'T DROP
HER BATHING SUIT COVER-UP

15:02.109 --> 15:04.612
FOR A CHANCE TO...

15:04.695 --> 15:06.155
OH, I GOTTA CATCH HIM.

15:06.238 --> 15:07.823
- YOU'RE BRINGING HIM
BACK?

15:07.906 --> 15:08.949
- NO, I'M GOING WITH HIM.

15:09.033 --> 15:11.452
I'LL BE BACK FOR MY TRIAL.

15:11.535 --> 15:13.162
MAX!
- ELKA.

15:13.245 --> 15:15.748
I WAS HALFWAY DOWN THE WALK
WHEN I REALIZED

15:15.831 --> 15:17.333
I COULD NOT
LEAVE WITHOUT MY--

15:17.416 --> 15:19.710
- YOU DON'T HAVE TO!
I'M COMING WITH YOU!

15:19.793 --> 15:21.337
- I WAS GOING TO SAY
"MITTENS."

15:21.420 --> 15:24.173
BUT THIS IS EVEN BETTER!

15:29.595 --> 15:31.639
- HOW IS EVERYONE ENJOYING
THEIR HEALTHY FOOD?

15:31.722 --> 15:34.808
[applause]

15:34.892 --> 15:37.811
- IT'S LIKE YOU SAID.
JUST TOOK THE RIGHT INGREDIENTS.

15:37.895 --> 15:39.396
- OKAY, WE'RE
GONNA START TAPING NOW.

15:39.480 --> 15:43.025
UH...ON MY HEAD WHIP.

15:43.108 --> 15:46.320
OH, HI, OHIO.
I'M VICTORIA CHASE.

15:46.403 --> 15:48.405
AND I'M HERE WITH JOY SCROGGS
AND MELANIE MORETTI,

15:48.489 --> 15:50.658
SO HOW DOES IT FEEL TO BE
THE SUBJECTS

15:50.741 --> 15:52.868
OF SO MUCH ADULATION?

15:52.951 --> 15:56.038
I MEAN, I KNOW.
BUT TELL THE PEOPLE RIGHT THERE.

15:56.121 --> 15:57.748
- WELL, IT WAS
MY BRAIN-CHILD REALLY.

15:57.831 --> 16:01.502
SELFLESSLY VOLUNTEERING TO
CREATE DELICIOUS, HEALTHY MEALS

16:01.585 --> 16:03.879
FOR THIS...
THE GREATEST GENERATION.

16:03.962 --> 16:05.756
- AW, THAT'S NICE.

16:05.839 --> 16:07.549
I'VE ALSO BROUGHT
ALONG WITH ME DR. JOE,

16:07.633 --> 16:10.052
A NUTRITIONIST
AT THE CLEVELAND CLINIC.

16:10.135 --> 16:12.846
HE'S BEEN ANALYZING THE MEALS
THAT HAVE BEEN PREPARED HERE

16:12.930 --> 16:15.224
BY MELANIE AND JOY.
- OH, DEAR GOD.

16:15.307 --> 16:17.643
- SO WHAT CAN YOU TELL US
ABOUT THE HEALTHY BENEFITS

16:17.726 --> 16:18.936
THAT THESE SENIORS
ARE REAPING?

16:19.019 --> 16:22.022
- ABSOLUTELY NONE,
VICTORIA.

16:22.106 --> 16:23.357
- WHAT?

16:23.440 --> 16:25.526
- THE FOOD IS HIGH
IN FAT, SUGAR, AND SODIUM.

16:25.609 --> 16:27.861
THESE ARE ARTERY-CLOGGING,
STROKE-INDUCING,

16:27.945 --> 16:29.363
DIABETES-PROMOTING MEALS.

16:31.490 --> 16:33.575
- MELANIE!

16:33.659 --> 16:36.161
WHAT HAVE YOU DONE
TO THESE FINE AMERICANS?

16:36.245 --> 16:37.579
- CUT!

16:37.663 --> 16:38.580
ALL RIGHT,
WHAT IS GOING ON HERE?

16:38.664 --> 16:39.915
- I DON'T KNOW.

16:39.998 --> 16:41.083
JOY, WHAT DID YOU ADD
TO THE FOOD?

16:41.166 --> 16:43.460
- YOU HEARD THE DOCTOR.
FLAVOR.

16:43.544 --> 16:46.004
I JUST COULDN'T RISK LOOKING BAD
IN FRONT OF THE CAMERA.

16:46.088 --> 16:47.548
YOU CANNOT AIR THIS.

16:47.631 --> 16:49.633
- WHAT, ARE YOU CRAZY?

16:49.717 --> 16:51.760
THIS HAS GONE FROM A PUFF-PIECE,
FEEL-GOOD STORY

16:51.844 --> 16:55.097
TO AN AWARD-WINNING
SHOCKER ON ELDER ABUSE.

16:55.180 --> 16:56.974
- BUT MY GREEN CARD.

16:57.057 --> 16:58.559
- DON'T WORRY,
I'LL PIXELATE YOUR FACES.

16:58.642 --> 17:01.395
OKAY, A NEW OPENING.

17:03.480 --> 17:07.276
OH, HI, OHIO.
THIS IS VICTORIA CHASE.

17:07.358 --> 17:10.445
WHAT WAS SUPPOSED TO BE A
SAFE HAVEN FOR HEALTHY SENIORS

17:10.529 --> 17:13.073
HAS TURNED INTO
A HEART ATTACK CENTRAL.

17:13.156 --> 17:16.410
THESE TWO VOLUNTEERS HAVE
TURNED MEALTIME

17:16.492 --> 17:18.662
INTO ASSISTED SUICIDE
ON A PLATE.

17:18.746 --> 17:20.289
HOW DO YOU FEEL ABOUT
THE FOOD, SIR?

17:20.372 --> 17:21.832
- I LOVE IT.
- IT'S KILLING YOU.

17:21.915 --> 17:24.126
- OH.

17:30.841 --> 17:32.259
- HEY, FARMER.

17:32.342 --> 17:34.636
I HAD A HANKERING
FOR A CHERRY TOMATO.

17:34.720 --> 17:37.473
- [chuckles]
HI, VICTORIA.

17:37.556 --> 17:39.308
- I JUST FINISHED
FILMING THIS SEGMENT

17:39.391 --> 17:40.726
THAT WOULD'VE
BEEN GREAT FOR ME

17:40.809 --> 17:42.811
BUT WOULD'VE HURT
MY FRIENDS,

17:42.895 --> 17:45.647
AND I THOUGHT,
"WHAT WOULD DAVE DO?"

17:45.731 --> 17:47.608
AND SO I DECIDED
TO PULL THE SEGMENT.

17:47.691 --> 17:50.152
I MEAN, YOU MAKE ME WANT TO
BE A BETTER PERSON.

17:50.235 --> 17:52.321
SO LET'S CELEBRATE.

17:52.404 --> 17:54.323
BEING GOOD MAKES ME
WANT TO BE BAD.

17:54.406 --> 17:56.992
- WELL...
HERE'S THE THING.

17:57.076 --> 17:59.787
MY EX-WIFE TOLD ME
WHAT YOU TWO TALKED ABOUT,

17:59.870 --> 18:02.831
AND WE ENDED UP HAVING A
LONG DISCUSSION ABOUT THE KIDS.

18:02.915 --> 18:05.626
- MM, KILLING THE MOOD,
BUT I CAN WORK THROUGH THAT.

18:05.709 --> 18:08.212
- AND WE DECIDED THAT
WHAT YOU SAID ABOUT THE KIDS

18:08.295 --> 18:09.797
WAS RIGHT.

18:09.880 --> 18:11.799
- FULL CUSTODY?
- YES.

18:11.882 --> 18:14.384
- [sigh]
- FOR BOTH OF US.

18:14.468 --> 18:16.804
WE REALIZED THAT
WHAT WAS BEST FOR THEM

18:16.887 --> 18:19.515
WAS FOR THE TWO OF US
TO WORK THINGS OUT

18:19.598 --> 18:21.183
AND GET BACK TOGETHER.

18:21.266 --> 18:23.477
SO WE'RE
GONNA GIVE IT A TRY.

18:23.560 --> 18:26.021
- AH.

18:26.105 --> 18:28.690
WELL, THAT'S...FABULOUS.

18:28.774 --> 18:33.529
- I'M SORRY WE COULDN'T
GET TO KNOW EACH OTHER BETTER.

18:33.612 --> 18:36.365
I LIKE YOU.

18:36.448 --> 18:38.700
- I LIKE YOU TOO.

18:40.828 --> 18:42.704
both: AUNTIE VICTORIA,
AUNTIE VICTORIA!

18:42.788 --> 18:44.998
THANK YOU, THANK YOU!

18:45.082 --> 18:48.585
- [chuckles]

18:48.669 --> 18:50.212
YES, SWEETIE?

18:50.295 --> 18:52.381
- IF YOU EVER
COME NEAR OUR DAD AGAIN

18:52.464 --> 18:55.467
YOU'RE DEAD.

19:03.809 --> 19:06.061
- OKAY, SHOULD WE TRY THESE
VOLUNTEER OPPORTUNITIES AGAIN?

19:06.144 --> 19:08.814
HOW ABOUT "CLEAN UP--"
- TOO DIRTY.

19:10.983 --> 19:13.277
- "ADOPT A--"
- TOO NEEDY.

19:13.360 --> 19:17.197
- VICTORIA, DO YOU WANNA
DO SOME VOLUNTEER WORK WITH ME?

19:17.281 --> 19:19.491
- MM, I'D LOVE TO,
BUT I HAVE A TUMMY ACHE.

19:21.952 --> 19:24.997
SEE, AND THAT'S HOW
YOU DO IT.

19:27.958 --> 19:29.918
- ELKA!
WHAT ARE YOU DOING BACK?

19:30.002 --> 19:33.255
- IT'S OFFICIAL,
I HATE FLORIDA.

19:33.338 --> 19:34.548
- WHERE'S MAX?

19:34.631 --> 19:36.758
- IT'S ALL OVER WITH MAX.

19:36.842 --> 19:38.927
- NO!
WHAT HAPPENED?

19:39.011 --> 19:42.264
- [sighs]
WE WENT TO HIS CONDO--

19:42.347 --> 19:45.309
OR SHOULD I SAY HIS SHRINE
TO HIS LATE WIFE?

19:45.392 --> 19:47.436
- WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

19:47.519 --> 19:49.938
- PICTURES, CLOTHES,
EVERYTHING.

19:50.022 --> 19:53.108
- WELL, SURELY
HE'LL MOVE THAT STUFF OUT.

19:53.192 --> 19:55.444
- IT WAS LIKE HE EXPECTED ME
TO PICK UP WHERE SHE LEFT OFF.

19:55.527 --> 19:57.279
- AW.

19:57.362 --> 19:59.114
- SOUNDS LIKE HE'S NOT
QUITE READY TO GET MARRIED YET.

19:59.197 --> 20:01.074
- YEAH, WE TALKED ABOUT IT.

20:01.158 --> 20:02.784
WE AGREED, HE'S NOT.

20:02.868 --> 20:04.328
- OH, I'M SO SORRY.

20:04.411 --> 20:05.954
- YOU KNOW,
IF MISERY LOVES COMPANY

20:06.038 --> 20:08.749
MY HOT GARDENER
WENT BACK TO HIS EX-WIFE.

20:08.832 --> 20:11.585
- THOSE FIRST WIVES
WILL GET YOU EVERY TIME.

20:13.712 --> 20:15.589
- YEAH.
WELL, I'LL GET OVER IT.

20:15.672 --> 20:19.134
BUT...
HE WAS A GOOD MAN.

20:19.217 --> 20:22.304
AND GOD, COULD HE
FILL A PAIR OF JEANS.

20:22.387 --> 20:24.681
HE HAD A BUTT
LIKE TWO SCOOPS OF ICE CREAM.

20:27.601 --> 20:29.937
- MAX TOO.

20:30.020 --> 20:33.148
SOFT SERVE,
BUT THE SAME IDEA.

20:33.231 --> 20:36.026
