my dad's car into a tree

14:57.967 --> 14:59.500
and I let my sister take the blame.

14:59.600 --> 15:02.333
Huh. I knew it. Mom's not perfect.

15:02.567 --> 15:04.266
She only pretends to be.

15:04.700 --> 15:06.467
So, what happened?

15:06.533 --> 15:10.200
Finally, I just broke down
and told everybody the truth.

15:11.734 --> 15:12.800
Did you get in trouble?

15:12.867 --> 15:15.767
Yeah. But I felt a lot better.

15:16.633 --> 15:19.734
Honey, I don't know the details here,

15:20.000 --> 15:22.600
but if it's something
that you think you can fix,

15:22.900 --> 15:24.100
then you should, sweetie.

15:25.066 --> 15:27.467
Because who knows, you might,
you might feel good enough

15:27.934 --> 15:29.233
to start being mean
to your brother again.

15:31.633 --> 15:34.166
Oh! Kate! There you are.

15:34.233 --> 15:37.100
Miranda? She didn't
start that rumor. I did.

15:37.166 --> 15:39.533
But I'd back off if I were you.

15:39.767 --> 15:42.033
Unless of course you want
things to get ugly.

15:42.200 --> 15:43.800
So, how was that?

15:44.100 --> 15:47.300
Who cares? My lizard's dead.

15:47.367 --> 15:49.333
[SIGHS] Matt! Pay attention.

15:51.266 --> 15:52.400
Ugh, okay.

-Well?

16:01.900 --> 16:03.700
Okay, I just wanted
to tell you that...

16:03.767 --> 16:05.200
I haven't got all day.

16:05.300 --> 16:08.934

16:13.533 --> 16:16.967
-Freak.
-Did you just call my friend a freak?

16:17.266 --> 16:19.467
She would have to be a freak
to be your friend.

16:19.533 --> 16:21.433
I'm not the one with green hair.

16:21.500 --> 16:24.033
Ugh! That's it. I've gone easy on you.

16:24.100 --> 16:26.834
That little stunt with Danny Kessler
and the posters all over the school?

16:26.900 --> 16:27.900
Those were nothing.

16:27.967 --> 16:30.800
I'm a cheerleader. I can turn
the whole school against you.

16:31.000 --> 16:32.133
The whole school?

16:32.233 --> 16:34.934
No. Just everyone
who's going to the Pep Rally.

16:41.233 --> 16:45.600
Poor Matt. His confidence
must be so shaken.

16:45.734 --> 16:48.667

alive one day,

16:48.800 --> 16:50.667
dead and buried the next.

16:51.166 --> 16:52.400
-Huh.
-What?

16:52.467 --> 16:54.333
It says here lizards hibernate.

16:54.800 --> 16:58.200
They appear dead,
while they're actually sleeping.

16:58.300 --> 16:59.567
-Well, that's great!
-Yeah!

16:59.667 --> 17:01.934
Now Matt can take her
back to class and...

17:06.100 --> 17:07.300
Uh-oh!

17:07.900 --> 17:09.567
-Get the shovel.
-Matt!

17:18.700 --> 17:20.266
She's really sleeping?

17:20.333 --> 17:22.133
Oh, sure. Can't you
hear her snoring?

17:24.900 --> 17:26.567
They sleep on their backs?

17:27.000 --> 17:29.633
With their little feet up
in the air like that?

17:29.700 --> 17:31.934
Yeah, there's something
in here about sleeping positions.

17:32.467 --> 17:34.200
Okay.

17:36.367 --> 17:38.367
Uh, honey, why don't you
keep the box open?

17:38.467 --> 17:39.934
'Cause she could
probably use some air.

17:40.000 --> 17:42.667
Yeah, just a thought, Matt,
you might wanna turn her back over

17:42.734 --> 17:44.800
on her little feet before
you bring her back to school.

17:46.133 --> 17:48.867
Yeah. Sure.

17:49.400 --> 17:51.233
GORDO: Why's going
to a Pep Rally required?

17:51.467 --> 17:52.967

isn't embarrassing enough

17:53.033 --> 17:54.333
without having to sing about it?

17:56.233 --> 17:58.633
I actually feel kind of sorry for her.

17:58.700 --> 18:00.533
-Really?
-[SCOFFS] No.

18:01.700 --> 18:03.600
Okay, that's it.
I can't take it anymore.

18:03.667 --> 18:04.900
I have to tell her.

18:04.967 --> 18:07.166
Lizzie, don't. I can handle this.

18:07.233 --> 18:08.867
I can totally handle this.

18:09.800 --> 18:12.734
Possibly. No, no.
You know what? I can handle this.

18:12.800 --> 18:15.800
I started this whole thing and I'm
finally gonna take responsibility

18:15.867 --> 18:17.133

finished talking to you.

18:56.567 --> 18:58.100
What has gotten into you?

18:58.500 --> 19:02.133
Okay, listen. Miranda didn't write
that instant message. I did.

19:03.300 --> 19:05.633
I was jealous that you made
cheerleader and I didn't.

19:06.800 --> 19:08.734
I'm sorry about what I wrote.
It was rude.

19:09.467 --> 19:11.033
And I wish I could take it back.

19:11.867 --> 19:14.000
Wow. I have to say, Lizzie,

19:14.066 --> 19:16.533
I didn't think you had it in you
to stand up to me.

19:16.600 --> 19:17.700
Good for you.

19:19.433 --> 19:20.834
I've been practicing.

19:21.600 --> 19:23.867
I guess that means
you're not gonna ruin Miranda's life?

19:23.934 --> 19:28.400
[SCOFFS] No. Of course not.
That would be mean.
