[narrator] Previously on Hit & Run:

00:07.541 --> 00:09.208
If I find out what Danielle knew,

00:09.291 --> 00:11.250
I can use it to stay out of prison.

00:11.333 --> 00:13.333
-We need to bring her in.
-Okay.

00:14.541 --> 00:17.250
[Naomi] You think she encoded
a message to herself inside a dance?

00:17.333 --> 00:19.166
Shit. The police.

00:22.458 --> 00:23.333
Enough! Enough!

00:24.166 --> 00:26.125
You get consumed with your work.

00:26.208 --> 00:30.291
You took my main source, and my friend,
and made him a sitting duck in prison.

00:30.375 --> 00:32.000
They're gonna kill him in there.

00:39.208 --> 00:41.583
[theme music playing]

01:06.375 --> 01:08.375
[sirens wailing in distance]

01:15.083 --> 01:17.083
[indistinct chatter]

01:27.916 --> 01:31.291
[man 1] ...stomped the shit out
of this Paki. Got me an extra six.

01:34.666 --> 01:36.041
And then I made a hole.

01:36.791 --> 01:39.708
I peeled it. Peeled it right off
that fucking bitch's face.

01:40.500 --> 01:42.416
Right off her face! I peeled it.

01:43.083 --> 01:44.458
I peeled her face back.

01:45.541 --> 01:46.833
I need some shoes!

01:49.500 --> 01:52.166
-I need some shoes.
-[man 2] I got enough problems!

01:52.250 --> 01:54.708
I need shoes! I need some fucking shoes!

01:55.708 --> 01:57.458
I peeled her face back.

02:02.958 --> 02:05.750
I picked it, then peeled it right off.

02:11.208 --> 02:14.666
[Newkirk] Anxious to get back
to your cell? I don't got to be here.

02:15.583 --> 02:19.208
I got you cold on three homicides.
My stats look great.

02:21.666 --> 02:25.000
I just came to, uh... talk with you.

02:26.000 --> 02:27.000
Manyak.

02:29.833 --> 02:30.666
Yeah, manyak.

02:30.750 --> 02:35.875
That's what came up on the Hebrew site
when I searched "asshole."

02:36.666 --> 02:37.541
Is that right?

02:37.625 --> 02:38.625
"Cocksucker."

02:39.708 --> 02:40.791
Oh.

02:42.791 --> 02:44.791
So y'all use that in Israel too, huh?

02:48.041 --> 02:49.375
A world full of men...

02:50.958 --> 02:53.625
still too dumb to turn that
into a compliment.

02:56.625 --> 02:58.666
You're gonna die in prison, Segev.

03:00.875 --> 03:02.333
Sooner than you think.

03:03.625 --> 03:05.583
And what the fuck does that mean?

03:06.083 --> 03:07.208
Hmm?

03:07.291 --> 03:09.541
I wanna know the whole story.

03:10.250 --> 03:14.416
I gotta admit,
I find you interesting, man.

03:14.500 --> 03:18.000
But the DA is gonna say
some crazy-ass Israeli shot up a nightclub

03:18.083 --> 03:20.666
and got caught up in a gang retaliation.

03:20.750 --> 03:23.083
You and your buddy could have
left the country,

03:23.166 --> 03:26.833
headed off to Israel after you killed
the two guys who killed your wife.

03:27.291 --> 03:28.541
Why did you stay?

03:29.875 --> 03:30.916
Why wait?

03:33.250 --> 03:34.750
What do you want from me?

03:35.250 --> 03:37.791
Just trying to loosen up that jaw, manyak.

03:38.333 --> 03:41.583
You've got me here. You have
your evidence. You'll get your conviction.

03:41.666 --> 03:45.041
If you want justice, do your job
and ask how my wife died.

03:46.000 --> 03:47.916
Find out who really killed her.

03:48.666 --> 03:51.375
Tell me.
Tell me what the fuck is happening.

03:51.458 --> 03:54.166
-Tell me what I don't know.
-You'll let me out?

03:55.583 --> 03:57.041
So, what the fuck is the point?

03:58.708 --> 04:01.833
The point is you and your boy Harel look
like serial killers.

04:02.625 --> 04:04.708
And I happen to know he had a son.

04:08.250 --> 04:11.875
So if you want this
to be his memory, so be it.

04:15.416 --> 04:17.083
Did you talk to Naomi Hicks?

04:18.291 --> 04:19.333
I don't know her.

04:20.791 --> 04:22.500
But I guess we could do that.

04:24.500 --> 04:25.416
Or...

04:26.791 --> 04:29.041
you enlighten me.

04:30.000 --> 04:30.833
Now.

04:33.375 --> 04:35.750
The body of the man from the junkyard.

04:35.833 --> 04:37.833
You haven't been able
to identify him, right?

04:39.333 --> 04:40.166
Not yet.

04:41.125 --> 04:42.083
You won't.

04:42.166 --> 04:43.500
It's the Mossad.

04:44.958 --> 04:47.833
They killed Ron,
and they will try to kill me.

04:47.916 --> 04:49.875
Right here. Soon.

04:58.541 --> 05:01.416
Tali, can you please talk to me?
Don't take it too far.

05:01.500 --> 05:02.666
Shut up.

05:04.041 --> 05:06.625
You didn't even delete
those messages, huh?

05:11.416 --> 05:13.041
You lost your mind? What's wrong with you?

05:13.125 --> 05:15.875
Sit down and shut up.
The next one will go to your knee.

05:20.708 --> 05:22.708
So the Mossad started using pussies,

05:22.791 --> 05:24.541
or did they have no idea?

05:25.208 --> 05:27.875
I need you to take a deep breath
and listen to what I have to say.

05:27.958 --> 05:29.625
You got something to say?

05:30.583 --> 05:31.541
Hmm?

05:31.625 --> 05:34.041
What is there to say? It's all right here.

05:34.125 --> 05:37.333
You forwarded messages from my phone
to yours, you fucking shit.

05:38.750 --> 05:39.875
So, what was the plan?

05:39.958 --> 05:41.833
Would you help them beat
your pregnant girlfriend

05:41.916 --> 05:43.458
or just sort of hang back?

05:44.125 --> 05:45.916
You don't see what's going on here?

05:46.625 --> 05:49.125
I kept those messages,
so I can protect you.

05:49.208 --> 05:50.708
So they could know what you didn't.

05:51.291 --> 05:53.000
The only reason I'm here is
to protect you.

05:53.083 --> 05:54.791
Of course. Yeah, sure, sure.

05:55.583 --> 05:57.916
It's just my hormones
that are making me paranoid.

05:58.000 --> 05:59.875
You love me, you wanted to help me.

06:01.125 --> 06:05.625
Maybe once all this is done,
we'll get a house in the Gallil,

06:06.333 --> 06:08.625
bake some bread, raise children.

06:13.875 --> 06:15.208
I really do love you.

06:16.833 --> 06:19.041
If I didn't,
I would let them take you away.

06:24.250 --> 06:25.541
Tali, please trust me.

06:27.458 --> 06:28.833
We can make it work.

06:31.125 --> 06:34.416
I want to be with you. With both of you.

06:36.958 --> 06:39.750
Your voice always gets pitchy
when you lie.

06:44.541 --> 06:45.833
[grunting]

06:49.375 --> 06:50.208
Are you okay?

06:50.291 --> 06:52.291
[dramatic music playing]

07:00.333 --> 07:01.208
Tali?

07:04.208 --> 07:06.125
[groaning]

07:14.750 --> 07:15.625
Get up.

07:19.500 --> 07:20.875
Get up. We're going.

07:31.208 --> 07:35.333
You wrote this without telling
your editor you were working on it?

07:35.416 --> 07:36.875
Are you even reading, Karina?

07:36.958 --> 07:39.625
There's more to it
than this young woman's death?

07:39.708 --> 07:40.833
Like why she was killed?

07:40.916 --> 07:44.083
I'm working that out.
I need to talk to some people.

07:44.958 --> 07:46.500
So why bring it in now?

07:46.583 --> 07:47.791
Because--

07:49.291 --> 07:50.666
If I don't get this published,

07:50.750 --> 07:53.666
they'll kill my friend
like they killed his wife.

07:53.750 --> 07:55.333
Can we make that the headline?

07:56.083 --> 07:58.083
-Karina, e-mail.
-Two minutes.

07:58.875 --> 08:01.125
Your friend. Where is he now?

08:01.208 --> 08:03.750
In city lockup.
He has an arraignment in 30 minutes.

08:03.833 --> 08:08.166
Do that. Let me get in the weeds on this.
I'll need your notes and files.

08:09.041 --> 08:12.833
Ask Legal up here now.
Tell them to wait in the conference room.

08:14.291 --> 08:16.416
You've done good work. I'll do what I can.

08:16.500 --> 08:18.875
This will go up the chain
before we move on it.

08:18.958 --> 08:21.333
I understand, but we're on a clock.

08:21.416 --> 08:23.416
If there's gonna be a fight,
let's have it now.

08:23.500 --> 08:25.750
Let me do the politics.
You go to the arraignment.

08:25.833 --> 08:27.666
We'll reconvene this afternoon.

08:30.291 --> 08:32.750
Tell me you have my back on this.

08:32.833 --> 08:36.333
This is the one.
Don't let it get strangled in the crib.

08:36.416 --> 08:40.541
I want the story just like you,
but I don't make promises I can't keep.

08:40.625 --> 08:43.208
The lawyers will have their say on this.

08:50.541 --> 08:52.541
-Hey, boss. Question.
-I'm busy.

08:52.625 --> 08:55.791
No, I'll be quick.
I got a body that I can't ID.

08:55.875 --> 08:58.458
Probably foreign
'cause the DNA's coming back blank.

08:58.541 --> 09:00.666
-Uh-huh.
-It doesn't make any sense.

09:00.750 --> 09:02.333
-You were Beret, right?
-Uh-huh.

09:02.416 --> 09:04.125
You ever run into any Mossad?

09:04.208 --> 09:08.041
I did some freelance work
after the service but not really. Why?

09:08.125 --> 09:12.500
Well, don't laugh, but what if Mossad
is here in the States to get someone

09:12.583 --> 09:14.166
-and they got got?
-[chuckles]

09:14.250 --> 09:18.041
-And why would I say that?
-Maybe that's why I can't get a match.

09:18.791 --> 09:20.958
Why are you bugging me with this?
Who told you that?

09:21.041 --> 09:23.708
-The suspect, Azulai.
-Okay.

09:24.250 --> 09:26.916
Let me make this simple.
Is the suspect alive?

09:27.416 --> 09:30.375
-He is.
-Then the Mossad ain't after him.

09:33.958 --> 09:35.791
I don't think it's that simple.

09:40.000 --> 09:41.708
[lock buzzes]

09:43.625 --> 09:45.625
[dramatic music playing]

10:07.916 --> 10:09.708
[lock buzzes]

10:30.708 --> 10:32.000
[lock buzzes]

10:34.916 --> 10:36.916
[man speaking indistinctly over PA]

10:43.083 --> 10:44.041
Who are you?

10:45.708 --> 10:46.958
Good morning, Segev.

10:47.958 --> 10:49.625
I'm from the consulate in Israel.

10:49.708 --> 10:53.958
Been informed you've been arrested
and we thought we'd just check on you.

10:54.625 --> 10:57.000
They're treating you well?
Got something to eat?

10:57.291 --> 10:59.791
Do you want us to reach out
to your family in Tel Aviv?

10:59.875 --> 11:03.125
Update them maybe?
Let them know what's going on?

11:03.208 --> 11:04.625
And why do you care?

11:05.791 --> 11:08.125
You're due this morning in court, right?

11:09.291 --> 11:11.166
You're happy
with the lawyer they gave you?

11:12.000 --> 11:14.250
-I still haven't met him.
-Mm-hm.

11:15.000 --> 11:16.666
Who told you I was here?

11:18.333 --> 11:23.708
We are, uh... informed every time
an Israeli gets arrested.

11:27.791 --> 11:33.500
You know that prisons in the United States
can be very dangerous.

11:40.916 --> 11:43.833
-What do you want from me?
-I wanna help.

11:45.541 --> 11:47.083
What do you think, I'm dumb?

11:48.750 --> 11:49.625
Huh?

11:51.083 --> 11:51.958
Talk.

11:55.916 --> 11:58.708
Actually, Segev, we prefer to talk less.

11:59.791 --> 12:02.416
As less as possible.

12:03.916 --> 12:06.750
And if that's hard for you,
we'd be happy to assist you,

12:07.416 --> 12:10.250
as well as any friends
you have around here.

12:11.083 --> 12:12.500
Go fuck yourself.

12:17.208 --> 12:19.750
Good luck in court today. Break a leg.

12:23.416 --> 12:26.500
-[gavel bangs]
-[woman] Next. People v. Azulai.

12:26.583 --> 12:30.708
Case number 2-0-1-3-B-X-0-7-1-7.

12:31.583 --> 12:32.750
[man] Hello, Your Honor.

12:34.208 --> 12:36.166
[woman] Segev Azulai. That you?

12:36.791 --> 12:37.666
Yeah.

12:38.458 --> 12:40.041
[woman] Mr. Azulai, you are being charged

12:40.125 --> 12:43.375
with three separate counts of murder
in the first degree. Do you understand?

12:43.458 --> 12:44.416
Yeah.

12:44.500 --> 12:47.458
[woman] Do you speak English? Are you
aware of the severity of these charges?

12:47.541 --> 12:49.625
-Yes.
-And how do you plead, sir?

12:50.875 --> 12:51.916
Not guilty.

12:52.375 --> 12:54.666
-Very well. Bail denied.
-[gavel bangs]

12:55.125 --> 12:58.125
Mr. Coughlin, see the clerk.
We'll get you on the calendar.

12:58.208 --> 12:59.750
[Coughlin] Thank you, Your Honor.

12:59.833 --> 13:05.291
[woman] People v. McCue.
Case number 2-0-1-3-X-2-2-9-7.

13:05.375 --> 13:06.458
[guard] Come with me.

13:09.833 --> 13:11.500
[bailiff] Next case on the docket...

13:11.583 --> 13:13.583
[ominous music playing]

13:34.250 --> 13:37.166
Detective Newkirk. It's Naomi Hicks.

13:38.541 --> 13:41.041
I'm glad you stopped me.
I was just coming to find you.

13:41.125 --> 13:43.500
-Have you talked to Segev?
-I have.

13:43.583 --> 13:44.458
And?

13:45.666 --> 13:48.791
-You don't believe him.
-Segev is a murder suspect.

13:48.875 --> 13:51.875
More to the point,
I know Segev killed those people.

13:51.958 --> 13:55.791
So as peculiar as his case is,
and I have to admit that it is,

13:56.291 --> 13:58.458
his words ain't holding
a lot of weight with me.

13:58.541 --> 14:01.458
-He's telling the truth.
-You're vouching for him?

14:01.541 --> 14:04.041
I'm trying to keep him alive
any way I can.

14:04.541 --> 14:06.791
Hopefully the story
I'm writing will do that,

14:06.875 --> 14:08.833
but the people who want him dead
are on a clock.

14:08.916 --> 14:11.250
I realize that this is asking a lot.

14:11.333 --> 14:15.541
If you want him to make it to trial,
listen to what I'm saying and help.

14:16.500 --> 14:18.458
-Help how?
-Make a call.

14:18.541 --> 14:20.666
Get him into protective custody.

14:21.375 --> 14:22.875
You really believe him?

14:22.958 --> 14:26.916
You think Israeli spies are gonna
break into jail and kill this guy?

14:27.000 --> 14:30.083
Detective, do you know
who Segev's wife was?

14:30.166 --> 14:33.666
Yeah, some American dancer.
Whatever. Good for him.

14:33.750 --> 14:36.958
Danielle was a cover.
Sophie Dreyer was her name.

14:37.041 --> 14:40.708
Sophie was a covert operative
with the CIA in Tel Aviv.

14:40.791 --> 14:41.833
She was murdered.

14:45.666 --> 14:46.750
We're on a clock.

14:47.291 --> 14:49.083
Help us buy some time, please.

14:49.166 --> 14:51.166
[suspenseful music playing]

14:56.708 --> 14:58.416
[lock buzzes]

15:08.375 --> 15:11.375
[man] ...stomped the shit out of this boy.
Got me an extra six.

15:12.083 --> 15:13.791
[guard] Get back. Get back!

15:15.375 --> 15:16.375
[lock buzzes]

15:20.125 --> 15:21.166
Get back.

15:21.250 --> 15:22.125
Get back.

15:22.916 --> 15:23.750
Get back!

16:26.208 --> 16:27.291
What's going on?

16:34.500 --> 16:35.500
Who's that?

16:40.958 --> 16:42.250
We used to date.

16:46.458 --> 16:47.500
Why'd you call me?

16:49.958 --> 16:51.083
He's Mossad.

16:52.666 --> 16:54.166
He's been keeping tabs on me.

16:56.375 --> 16:58.583
Showed up again after Danielle died.

17:00.041 --> 17:03.291
I think he might have bugged my apartment,
so I brought him here.

17:06.458 --> 17:07.708
So why am I here?

17:10.416 --> 17:11.916
Thought you'd make him talk.

17:13.250 --> 17:15.125
I thought you can do that, can't you?

17:15.208 --> 17:17.208
[ominous music playing]

17:21.083 --> 17:22.083
[grunts]

17:23.458 --> 17:24.458
Tali, who's that?

17:25.958 --> 17:28.291
Did you tell him about me?
You're making a mistake!

17:28.875 --> 17:29.958
[Assaf snaps fingers]

17:30.541 --> 17:31.458
Calm down.

17:32.041 --> 17:34.750
-Tali, please, you gotta stop this now.
-Omer.

17:34.833 --> 17:37.583
I'm not gonna be able to stop them!
You're making a mistake!

17:37.666 --> 17:41.000
Omer, look up. Look up.
I'm Assaf. Nice to meet you.

17:42.958 --> 17:46.541
I know you didn't mean to hurt Tali.
But we got a problem.

17:47.708 --> 17:48.541
Hm?

17:53.416 --> 17:56.333
You know what I used to do
in the army? Chaksav.

17:56.416 --> 17:58.250
You know that one? Unit 504?

18:00.041 --> 18:01.166
Interrogations.

18:02.083 --> 18:04.291
Of prisoners, in wartime and such.

18:05.083 --> 18:06.791
Are you serious, Tali?

18:07.500 --> 18:09.125
We were allowed to do it all.

18:09.791 --> 18:12.666
Anything, to get information out.

18:13.916 --> 18:15.000
Every last detail.

18:17.791 --> 18:18.791
Get the picture?

18:21.916 --> 18:23.666
Truth is, I don't miss it at all.

18:24.916 --> 18:26.083
But when I see you...

18:29.291 --> 18:31.000
I start to get that itch.

18:37.625 --> 18:38.458
Tali.

18:39.708 --> 18:40.750
Tali!

18:40.833 --> 18:42.166
Listen, you piece of shit.

18:42.833 --> 18:45.625
Your girlfriend's pregnant
and you put her in danger.

18:45.708 --> 18:47.250
For me, that's worse than terrorist.

18:47.875 --> 18:49.708
Do you know what I did with terrorists?

18:52.916 --> 18:54.916
[Omer screaming]

19:08.041 --> 19:10.125

19:12.208 --> 19:15.333
[man over PA] All guards report
to the prison yard immediately.

19:15.416 --> 19:18.208
All guards report
to the prison yard immediately.

19:20.666 --> 19:22.166
Exit your cell, inmate.

19:22.250 --> 19:23.416
It's common time.

19:25.666 --> 19:26.750
Can I use a phone?

19:27.750 --> 19:31.083
Sure, you can use mine.
Why don't you order a pizza?

19:34.041 --> 19:35.458
Get the fuck up, kebab.

19:41.250 --> 19:42.791
Using the fucking phone...

19:43.583 --> 19:45.583
[suspenseful music playing]

19:55.041 --> 19:55.875
Thanks.

20:10.333 --> 20:11.833
Goddamn it.

20:15.375 --> 20:16.708
Fuck you looking at?

20:19.583 --> 20:21.583
-[sighs]
-[keypad clacking]

20:25.208 --> 20:27.291
Yeah, hello? City lockup.

20:29.041 --> 20:31.583
I need to put a prisoner
under protective custody.

20:32.125 --> 20:34.125
[indistinct chatter]

21:06.500 --> 21:07.333
[yelps]

21:36.000 --> 21:38.000
[dramatic music playing]

22:06.958 --> 22:10.041
-[Segev] Hey. How long have I been here?
-[monitor beeping]

22:11.250 --> 22:14.333
Almost a day. The anesthetic
is starting to wear off.

22:14.416 --> 22:18.125
-You might feel a little confused.
-Where is the crazy guy?

22:19.958 --> 22:21.708
The crazy guy, where is he?

22:23.583 --> 22:24.833
Go on back to sleep.

22:31.958 --> 22:33.958
[nurse speaking indistinctly]

22:56.000 --> 22:58.541
[Naomi] Oh. What the hell happened?

22:58.625 --> 23:01.041
Why is Karina's assistant blowing me up?

23:01.125 --> 23:04.291
The publisher's in the conference room.
He's been there awhile.

23:04.375 --> 23:06.708
-Karina wants to set him on fire.
-Weldon's here?

23:06.791 --> 23:08.750
Shit. Why didn't you text me?

23:09.750 --> 23:12.833
-Have you looked at your messages?
-No. Take this.

23:13.708 --> 23:17.083
I'm just conscious
of the ramifications of this story.

23:18.791 --> 23:24.500
Ah. And I would like to be
a guiding light for balance here.

23:28.333 --> 23:32.041
I have been led to believe
that one of the sources of your story

23:32.125 --> 23:33.666
is a personal acquaintance of yours.

23:33.750 --> 23:34.750
Mm-hm.

23:35.333 --> 23:38.500
I have complete confidence in my staff.
You know what you're doing.

23:38.583 --> 23:40.291
You are journalists, I am not.

23:40.375 --> 23:42.708
But when building a story this big,

23:42.791 --> 23:47.333
it would be nice if the foundation could
not be seen to be tainted in any way.

23:47.416 --> 23:48.666
Tainted how?

23:48.750 --> 23:51.083
What is your relationship
with your source?

23:53.000 --> 23:56.750
-We're friends.
-But you had a romantic relationship.

24:00.333 --> 24:03.416
If you're asking if we slept together,
yes, 20 years ago,

24:03.500 --> 24:06.250
but in no way does that affect
the nature of the story.

24:06.333 --> 24:08.041
I'm not saying that it does.

24:08.125 --> 24:11.166
I'm saying that the appearance
of bias is as good as bias,

24:11.250 --> 24:13.916
especially when you're talking about--
This is Israel.

24:14.000 --> 24:17.625
It's our closest ally.
Let's not bullshit ourselves.

24:17.708 --> 24:20.583
Okay? Begging your pardon.
Caution is warranted.

24:20.666 --> 24:24.333
My relationship with the source
is why this story happened.

24:24.416 --> 24:28.083
It wouldn't even be possible if I wasn't
a firsthand party to the information.

24:28.166 --> 24:29.666
I'm the only one who could do it.

24:29.750 --> 24:32.625
-That doesn't change anything--
-What are we doing here,

24:32.708 --> 24:35.291
if it's not to find stories like this?

24:35.375 --> 24:38.375
This makes us relevant.
Puts you in the conversation

24:38.458 --> 24:41.041
with the Times Magazine,
Harper's and New Yorker.

24:41.125 --> 24:44.416
-Isn't that what you want?
-We all have jobs here.

24:44.500 --> 24:49.416
I'm pretty sure yours isn't telling me
how relevant this magazine is.

24:51.666 --> 24:55.916
When I get a look at the final product,
which Karina assures me I will soon,

24:56.625 --> 24:58.958
I'll have a better perspective on this.

24:59.041 --> 25:03.250
Now I want to remind everyone here
that the publication of any story

25:03.333 --> 25:06.458
under the banner of this magazine
is a privilege. It's not a right.

25:07.250 --> 25:11.208
I take pride in hearing an array of voices
in my decision-making process,

25:11.291 --> 25:15.333
but the final decision for publication
will be mine and mine alone.

25:15.958 --> 25:18.291
-[Karina] Understood, Peter.
-Great.

25:18.375 --> 25:20.333
Then I'll let you get on with it.

25:21.000 --> 25:23.125
Keep up the stellar work. Gentlemen.

25:30.958 --> 25:32.333
That motherfucker.

25:34.750 --> 25:35.916
Is this gonna die?

25:36.000 --> 25:38.750
I don't know. Maybe.
You've done good work.

25:38.833 --> 25:40.791
That makes the story even more dangerous.

25:42.875 --> 25:45.625
What if we bring in someone else
to help you?

25:47.125 --> 25:50.250
Put their name first on the byline,
that way things don't seem biased.

25:50.333 --> 25:53.041
No fucking way. I did all the work.

25:53.875 --> 25:56.041
I get that,
and normally I wouldn't suggest it,

25:56.125 --> 25:58.375
but you're telling me
we have to publish this now.

25:58.458 --> 26:00.333
So, what's more important?

26:00.416 --> 26:03.375
The story gets published,
or it gets published with your name?

26:03.458 --> 26:06.375
I'm not sharing my byline, Karina.

26:27.750 --> 26:29.083
No, no, go ahead.

26:30.000 --> 26:31.291
Sure could use one.

26:33.916 --> 26:35.416
I forgot to eat today.

26:36.750 --> 26:38.875
You should. Do it for the kid.

26:42.083 --> 26:43.083
Is Segev dead?

26:43.916 --> 26:46.250
It's not clear. He doesn't know much.

26:46.708 --> 26:49.083
They promised he'd be accepted
into special ops.

26:49.166 --> 26:50.333
This was his exam.

26:52.041 --> 26:53.041
[Tali groans]

26:54.083 --> 26:55.666
I need to talk to Segev.

26:57.083 --> 26:59.958
I don't where he is, if he's even alive.

27:09.458 --> 27:11.333
We need to discuss what we're facing.

27:12.041 --> 27:13.958
-What? Prison?
-Yeah.

27:14.708 --> 27:16.791
But first they'll berate us in the press.

27:17.291 --> 27:21.125
Traitors, spies. That good stuff.
Hell on your kid too.

27:21.208 --> 27:25.041
What can we do?
It's not like we can drop Omer out there.

27:25.583 --> 27:27.708
[dramatic music playing]

27:27.791 --> 27:29.541
I can't decide for you Tali.

27:32.666 --> 27:36.125
But nothing in this world would prevent me
from raising my kid.

27:50.000 --> 27:51.333
You need to leave now.

27:53.416 --> 27:55.708
Now. Get out of here.

27:58.291 --> 27:59.333
Where do I go?

28:07.750 --> 28:09.416
What about you? What about Omer?

28:13.375 --> 28:14.375
I'll handle it.

28:22.166 --> 28:23.000
Thanks.

28:37.500 --> 28:39.500
[monitor beeping]

28:52.500 --> 28:53.583
How you feeling?

28:53.666 --> 28:56.333
Nurse says
you got knocked around pretty good.

28:58.166 --> 28:59.166
It was you?

29:03.083 --> 29:04.125
Give us a minute.

29:04.625 --> 29:06.791
[dramatic music playing]

29:08.000 --> 29:11.458
If I have made a consistent mistake

29:11.541 --> 29:14.125
in this whole saga,
it's selling you short.

29:15.083 --> 29:18.083
Strange. I know your whole history,
the training--

29:18.166 --> 29:20.708
You sent this motherfucker
in here after me?

29:21.416 --> 29:25.458
-Sorry. We needed to talk.
-So talk, motherfucker. Talk.

29:25.541 --> 29:28.375
Stop lying and tell me,
what do you want from me?

29:30.666 --> 29:32.083
Danielle's notebook.

29:32.958 --> 29:34.666
She meant for me to have it.

29:35.250 --> 29:37.375
She died trying to make that happen.

29:40.250 --> 29:41.125
No.

29:42.458 --> 29:46.166
She died stealing secrets
and keeping secrets.

29:47.333 --> 29:50.041
From me
and from every other Israeli she knew.

29:51.291 --> 29:52.500
Lying and betraying.

29:58.833 --> 29:59.833
Segev...

30:03.583 --> 30:06.833
These last few weeks
have been hard on you,

30:06.916 --> 30:09.958
and for my part in that, I'm sorry.

30:10.041 --> 30:12.250
But even with all the secrets,

30:12.333 --> 30:16.625
you know that's not who your wife was.

30:18.708 --> 30:19.833
She was a hero.

30:22.666 --> 30:25.500
We needed her
to get very classified information

30:25.583 --> 30:27.666
from the national security advisor.

30:29.166 --> 30:32.041
She called me the night it happened.

30:34.833 --> 30:37.000
She had overheard a phone call.

30:37.083 --> 30:39.625
Something about a meeting. Off the books.

30:40.000 --> 30:43.375
Between Assaf and his boss.
His name is Eitan Sharon.

30:44.083 --> 30:47.875
I asked not to call me for the next
two hours. Why? What's so urgent?

30:47.958 --> 30:49.958
[pop music playing over speakers]

30:51.083 --> 30:52.791
What? What information?

30:54.416 --> 30:55.666
Assaf?

30:56.416 --> 30:59.500
No, she can't hear me. It's just
some girl. You can talk, go ahead.

31:01.166 --> 31:03.541
Okay, what do you mean, disaster?
What happened?

31:05.375 --> 31:06.375
[Assaf sighs]

31:06.833 --> 31:08.458
We can't let them find out.

31:11.750 --> 31:14.416
Yeah, okay.
Tell Eitan I'll get there real soon.

31:17.583 --> 31:20.750
I'll get there as fast as I can. Bye.

31:22.208 --> 31:25.375
-Everything okay?
-Yeah, it's just work.

31:26.666 --> 31:27.750
You're leaving?

31:29.541 --> 31:31.666
Yeah, I'm... I'll call you later.

31:35.000 --> 31:37.833
I'm glad I rushed over and made Syd leave.

31:43.708 --> 31:46.208
I'll be back soon. I promise.

[engine starts]

32:40.166 --> 32:43.708
[Martin] Assaf's boss, Sharon,
was a guy with top-level access

32:44.416 --> 32:46.666
in Aman, Mossad, everything.

33:10.125 --> 33:12.125
[inaudible dialogue]

33:29.625 --> 33:33.375
This was the first time
we were able to get close to Eitan,

33:34.041 --> 33:36.333
but the place was too small
for her to get in

33:36.416 --> 33:38.750
and get anywhere near the conversation.

33:46.833 --> 33:48.000
[car alarm chirps]

33:58.208 --> 33:59.458
We pieced together

33:59.541 --> 34:01.458
what must have happened next

34:01.541 --> 34:06.333
from the chatter on the Israeli side
and some CCTV footage.

34:10.041 --> 34:13.791
It seems she waited outside
the restaurant for hours.

34:13.875 --> 34:14.750
Watching.

34:16.125 --> 34:17.916
Hoping to maybe get something.

34:18.000 --> 34:22.333
And then an opportunity presented itself.

34:26.208 --> 34:28.208
[suspenseful music playing]

[device beeping]

Whatever she found there,
we know it was top secret,

35:29.750 --> 35:31.416
classified information.

35:42.500 --> 35:44.166
Ah! [in Hebrew] Oh, my God!

35:45.708 --> 35:47.583
You scared me.

35:47.666 --> 35:51.875
-[in English] What are you doing?
-I'm sorry. I dropped my keys.

35:53.833 --> 35:56.416
-Good night to you.
-You too.

36:01.583 --> 36:02.750
What are you doing here?

36:02.833 --> 36:06.208
I know how this looks,
but it's not what you think.

36:07.625 --> 36:09.041
I'm his lover.

36:09.916 --> 36:14.708
Eitan. I'm Eitan's lover.
I was just trying to leave him a present.

36:14.791 --> 36:15.791
Really?

36:59.375 --> 37:01.541
-Hello?
-[in English] Hey, Dad.

37:01.625 --> 37:04.083
Hey, sweetie. You don't sound so good.

37:05.208 --> 37:08.083
Yeah, I just really needed
to hear your voice.

37:08.166 --> 37:09.333
Everything okay?

37:10.125 --> 37:12.500
Yeah, things have been tough lately.

37:14.416 --> 37:17.041
I haven't been feeling great.

37:19.125 --> 37:22.000
I may have caught something
that's going around.

37:22.500 --> 37:25.875
Well, why don't you come home
for a week? Unplug.

37:25.958 --> 37:28.208
Your mother would love
the chance to spoil you.

37:28.291 --> 37:31.791
-I'll get you on the next flight.
-I have a family now, Dad.

37:32.958 --> 37:34.250
I can't just leave.

37:34.916 --> 37:36.958
You have to take care of yourself.

37:37.416 --> 37:40.416
Doesn't matter about the family.
You have to take care of yourself.

37:40.500 --> 37:43.791
I know, just let me figure it out. Okay?

37:43.875 --> 37:45.250
[call disconnects]

37:48.750 --> 37:50.708
We need to get her out of there right now.

38:18.375 --> 38:21.041
[Martin] She was supposed
to evacuate. Immediately.

38:21.125 --> 38:21.958
[Segev] Two.

38:23.208 --> 38:24.958
It took her 72 hours.

38:28.041 --> 38:29.500
-Please, Dad.
-[Segev] Take the card.

38:29.583 --> 38:31.416
-Stop! Come on, Dad.
-Show me. Take two.

38:32.291 --> 38:33.125
Show me.

38:34.041 --> 38:34.958
One more.

38:36.375 --> 38:38.041
You lost though. Big deal.

38:38.125 --> 38:40.291
That hesitation, that delay...

38:41.375 --> 38:43.083
probably cost her her life.

38:43.833 --> 38:45.583
-No way.
-Dad. Please, Dad.

38:45.666 --> 38:46.958
No cheating.

38:47.958 --> 38:50.333
Sophie was an amazing woman.

38:51.083 --> 38:54.208
-She was one of our best.
-Why didn't she leave?

38:57.416 --> 38:58.833
Because she thought...

39:00.291 --> 39:04.083
she could convince you
to move to New York with her.

39:05.708 --> 39:10.375
I know. It's hard to discover you don't
know everything about your wife, but...

39:10.750 --> 39:11.750
she loved you.

39:14.916 --> 39:17.041
You can finish the work she started.

39:19.125 --> 39:20.791
What do I get if I help you?

39:22.208 --> 39:23.125
Fresh start.

39:26.125 --> 39:28.791
Show me what you found,
give me the notebook,

39:29.666 --> 39:31.375
and Segev Azulai...

39:33.250 --> 39:35.291
will have died in this jail
of his injuries.

39:35.958 --> 39:36.833
You, however,

39:38.416 --> 39:39.791
will start a new life.

39:42.458 --> 39:43.583
With a new name.

39:44.625 --> 39:45.500
Free.

39:47.166 --> 39:48.708
Tell me what I wanna know.

39:48.791 --> 39:50.791
[dramatic music playing]

39:51.916 --> 39:53.250
What happens to Ella?

39:55.166 --> 39:58.875
-I can't give up my daughter.
-You're staring at life in prison.

39:59.541 --> 40:01.041
That's giving up your daughter.

40:03.500 --> 40:05.750
Why would I believe anything you say, huh?

40:06.666 --> 40:08.083
What choice do you have?

40:44.625 --> 40:46.291
[line beeps]

40:46.375 --> 40:48.916

41:06.750 --> 41:07.833
Maya, it's me.

41:09.958 --> 41:10.958

41:56.458 --> 41:57.291
[Omer] Tali!

42:01.166 --> 42:02.375
Tali, what's going on?

42:04.541 --> 42:05.583
Tali!

42:06.041 --> 42:07.125
Get me out of here!

42:09.375 --> 42:11.083
Tali, can you hear me?

42:11.166 --> 42:12.000
Tali!

42:14.083 --> 42:15.041
Help!

42:15.125 --> 42:18.833
Because, again, I specifically called
to have him put in PC.

42:19.500 --> 42:23.041
How the hell was he able to be attacked?
Why wasn't I called?

42:23.125 --> 42:24.625
I don't have that information.

42:24.708 --> 42:26.541
Where is he right now? Give me the room.

42:27.333 --> 42:29.791
-Try the infirmary.
-Thank you.

42:30.416 --> 42:31.250
Shit!
