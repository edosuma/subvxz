withstand the shaming stares

not be what you needed, Mileva.

Mileva: What about
Hans and Eduard?

a reliable father.

35:51.756 --> 35:53.485
Your equations are co-variant?

35:53.486 --> 35:54.606
Einstein: Yes.

general relativity

35:56.211 --> 35:58.809
of all forms of motion.

Mileva: It's an
extraordinary achievement.

Einstein: And you were
there to help me at

36:03.999 --> 36:06.305
the beginning of it all.

36:06.306 --> 36:07.876
I will never forget that.

much discussion of a Nobel.

You know, it comes with a
great deal of prize money.

36:21.659 --> 36:23.677
I want you to have it.

36:23.678 --> 36:24.766
All of it.

36:24.767 --> 36:27.458
Mileva: You want to
pay me for a divorce.

be taken care of, Dollie.

Mileva: Do not call me that.

36:30.696 --> 36:32.618
Einstein: I'm offering you
more money than either of us

36:32.619 --> 36:33.836
has ever seen, Mileva.

36:33.837 --> 36:34.831
You need this.

36:34.832 --> 36:36.304
Don't be proud.

36:36.305 --> 36:37.266
Mileva: Get out.

36:37.267 --> 36:38.900
Einstein: If not for
you, do it for the boys.

36:38.901 --> 36:41.821
Mileva: I said get out!

36:52.235 --> 36:56.308
Einstein: What more
do you want from me?

37:12.523 --> 37:15.246
Hans: Why are you doing
this to yourself, mother?

37:15.247 --> 37:16.752
He obviously wants
nothing to do with us.

37:16.753 --> 37:20.410
He hasn't since he left
me sitting on that step.

37:21.337 --> 37:23.290
Just give him what he wants.

37:23.291 --> 37:25.791
He'll be out of our lives
and we can all move forward,

37:25.792 --> 37:28.134
once and for all.

37:50.662 --> 37:52.937
Elsa: Well?

37:52.938 --> 37:55.953
Einstein: She finally agreed.

37:57.681 --> 38:01.498
But it comes with
a terrible price.

38:09.187 --> 38:12.263
Magistrate: State the
reason for your divorce.

38:12.264 --> 38:14.828
Einstein: Adultery,
Herr Richter.

38:14.829 --> 38:16.718
Magistrate: And who
is the guilty party?

38:16.719 --> 38:18.898
Einstein: I am, Herr Richter.

38:18.899 --> 38:23.128
I have been living with Elsa
Einstein, divorced löwenthal,

38:23.129 --> 38:27.616
for approximately four years,
and have had continued

38:27.617 --> 38:30.761
intimate relations with her.

38:31.142 --> 38:32.359
Magistrate: Did you bring proof?

38:32.360 --> 38:35.212
Albert: She's the woman sitting
behind me, Herr Richter.

38:35.213 --> 38:38.228
Magistrate: Well please indicate
to the court, where she is.

38:45.533 --> 38:49.702
Is this true, madam?

38:50.180 --> 38:51.846
Elsa: Yes, Herr Richter.

38:51.847 --> 38:53.416
Magistrate: The provisions of
the divorce state that

38:53.417 --> 38:56.428
Mileva Maric, married
Einstein, will receive

38:56.429 --> 38:59.826
an annual stipend
of 9,000 Deutschmarks.

38:59.827 --> 39:03.063
Adding to this, Professor
Einstein promises her the full

39:03.064 --> 39:06.208
proceeds of a Nobel prize,
should he be awarded it.

39:09.635 --> 39:11.107
Very well.

39:11.108 --> 39:12.550
On to the children.

39:12.551 --> 39:16.171
Mileva Maric is to retain full
custody in Zürich, and the boys

39:16.172 --> 39:21.175
shall not be permitted to
visit their father in Berlin.

39:25.948 --> 39:28.003
Professor, do you object?

39:40.692 --> 39:43.771
Einstein: No, I do not object.

39:47.389 --> 39:50.149
Photographers: Dr and
Mrs Einstein, over here!

39:52.710 --> 39:54.792
Reporter: Dr Einstein,
Dr Einstein!

39:54.793 --> 39:56.748
What did you do when
you heard that Mr Eddington

39:56.749 --> 39:57.902
had proved your theory correct?

39:57.903 --> 40:00.017
Einstein: Well, I
went back to work.

40:00.018 --> 40:02.585
And I bought myself
a new violin.

40:04.248 --> 40:06.875
Reporter: Mr Eddington, what
did your pictures prove exactly?

40:06.876 --> 40:10.369
Eddington: That gravity bends
light passing next to the sun by

40:10.370 --> 40:14.411
approximately 1.7 arc seconds,
just as Einstein predicted.

40:15.626 --> 40:17.260
Reporter 2: Meaning what?

40:17.261 --> 40:19.600
Eddington: Meaning, gentlemen,
that the greatest of all

40:19.601 --> 40:24.055
scientific generalizations, the
laws of sir Isaac Newton,

40:24.056 --> 40:26.362
have just received their
first major modification

40:26.363 --> 40:28.189
in over two centuries.

40:28.190 --> 40:31.330
We are all witness to one of the
most resplendent achievements

40:31.331 --> 40:34.635
of human thought
in our lifetime.

40:35.145 --> 40:37.648
Write that down.

40:38.094 --> 40:39.471
Lenard: Relativity is a hoax.

40:39.472 --> 40:43.353
Arrhenius: Doctor Lenard, it was
just proven by Arthur Eddington.

40:44.151 --> 40:46.586
Lenard: What happens at the next
eclipse, when the results vary?

40:46.587 --> 40:48.220
You will look like fools.

40:48.221 --> 40:51.298
Our discoveries changed
science because they were

40:51.299 --> 40:52.804
grounded in facts.

40:52.805 --> 40:55.912
They weren't philosophical
conjectures cloaked in

40:55.913 --> 40:58.448
equations designed to deceive.

40:59.375 --> 41:01.906
As the Nobel selection
committee, it is your duty

41:01.907 --> 41:04.025
to know the difference.

41:06.106 --> 41:09.726
Einstein: They're
giving it to Max Planck.

41:09.727 --> 41:11.169
Elsa: Well, you always
said it was a shame how the

41:11.170 --> 41:13.861
Nobel committee overlooked
him all these years.

41:13.862 --> 41:15.784
Einstein: They're
giving it to Fritz, too.

41:15.785 --> 41:18.320
In chemistry.

41:18.574 --> 41:21.910
For his nitrogen trick.

41:23.253 --> 41:26.717
Elsa: Quite a year for
the Prussian Academy.

41:27.355 --> 41:31.361
Well, I'm sure a lovely
celebration will be in order.

41:31.362 --> 41:33.507
Einstein: I'm not going
if Fritz is to be honored.

41:33.508 --> 41:36.552
Elsa: Albert, if you insist
on condemning a man for his

41:36.553 --> 41:39.793
mistakes you must be willing to
applaud him for his triumphs.

41:40.399 --> 41:41.777
Fritz didn't start the war.

41:41.778 --> 41:43.828
Einstein: He's responsible
for thousands of deaths.

41:43.829 --> 41:47.097
Elsa: He also saved half
of Europe from starvation.

41:47.098 --> 41:48.603
Doesn't that mean something?

41:48.604 --> 41:50.303
Einstein: I cannot
congratulate a killer and

41:50.304 --> 41:51.648
call myself a pacifist.

41:51.649 --> 41:54.854
Elsa: But if you insist that
the worst disputes between two

41:54.855 --> 41:57.995
warring nations can be
resolved, then can't two

41:57.996 --> 42:00.723
old friends make peace?

42:07.130 --> 42:08.828
Planck: Albert!

42:08.829 --> 42:10.910
Einstein: What can
I say, old friend?

42:10.911 --> 42:13.346
It's about time
they honored you.

42:13.347 --> 42:16.587
How many years has it been since
you discovered light quanta?

42:17.066 --> 42:19.597
Planck: About 3,000.

42:19.598 --> 42:22.961
Einstein: Truly,
Max, congratulations.

42:22.962 --> 42:24.467
Planck: It should
have been yours.

42:24.468 --> 42:26.807
Einstein: Nonsense.

42:26.808 --> 42:29.023
You deserve it more than
any man in this room.

42:30.078 --> 42:32.064
Man: Excuse me, Dr Planck?

42:32.065 --> 42:35.625
Planck: We'll talk.

42:40.494 --> 42:46.490
♪

42:53.090 --> 42:54.435
Haber: Albert.

42:54.436 --> 42:59.050
Einstein: A Nobel in
chemistry, that is something.

42:59.051 --> 43:01.454
Haber: I'm not a genius
like you, Albert.

43:01.455 --> 43:04.275
All I did was see a problem
and find a way to fix it.

43:04.276 --> 43:05.941
That's what I try
to do, I suppose.

43:05.942 --> 43:07.030
Fix things.

43:07.031 --> 43:08.377
Einstein: Yes, of course.

43:08.378 --> 43:09.883
Or destroy them.

43:09.884 --> 43:11.454
Haber: That is entirely unfair.

43:11.455 --> 43:14.082
Einstein: Did you not invent a
new way to destroy human life?

43:14.083 --> 43:17.415
Haber: Yes, but that was
not my only innovation.

43:17.416 --> 43:20.556
I'm being honored tonight
for the good I've done.

43:20.557 --> 43:21.999
Einstein: Life
cannot be balanced

43:22.000 --> 43:24.979
like an equation, Fritz.

43:24.980 --> 43:28.156
Good deeds do not
erase the evil ones.

43:29.659 --> 43:33.380
Haber: I certainly pray to God
you're wrong for once, Albert.

43:35.781 --> 43:38.028
Einstein: Perhaps I
have been too harsh.

43:40.204 --> 43:42.483
Haber: Perhaps you haven't.

43:44.242 --> 43:45.459
Einstein: I never
told you, Fritz,

43:45.460 --> 43:49.274
how sorry I was, about Clara.

43:49.275 --> 43:50.459
Haber: We couldn't
manage to hold on to the

43:50.460 --> 43:53.251
more brilliant ones, could we?

43:53.889 --> 43:57.931
Photographer: Gentlemen, smile!

43:58.890 --> 44:00.363
Lenard: He didn't even
win the Nobel and yet

44:00.364 --> 44:02.414
still he graces our front pages.

44:02.415 --> 44:03.760
And not only in Berlin.

44:03.761 --> 44:07.931
Frankfurt, Paris, London,
New York, Tokyo, I could go on.

44:09.562 --> 44:12.125
Weyland: All about
"general relativity," yes.

44:12.126 --> 44:13.952
Lenard: Relativity,
politics, his hair,

44:13.953 --> 44:15.875
what he ate for breakfast.

44:15.876 --> 44:17.125
It's despicable.

44:17.126 --> 44:19.177
Weyland: It's to be expected.

44:19.178 --> 44:20.458
He's a Jew.

44:20.459 --> 44:22.734
A publicity-seeking
Jew who uses his influence

44:22.735 --> 44:24.977
for his own profit.

44:24.978 --> 44:28.696
Lenard: Well now, Herr Weyland,
I didn't quite say all that.

44:28.697 --> 44:32.157
Weyland: You are standing in the
German national people's party

44:32.158 --> 44:35.426
headquarters, Dr
Lenard, we aren't afraid

44:35.427 --> 44:37.381
to speak the truth here.

44:37.382 --> 44:40.073
In fact, I imagine my
candor is the very reason

44:40.074 --> 44:41.263
you've come to see me.

44:43.023 --> 44:46.840
Now, please, what
can I do for you?

44:47.990 --> 44:50.714
Lenard: I have a proposition
to make, but one with which

44:50.715 --> 44:53.823
I cannot afford to be
publicly associated.

44:53.824 --> 44:56.899
Weyland: You can be
assured of my discretion.

44:56.900 --> 45:00.426
Lenard: I read your paper
denouncing relativity.

45:00.427 --> 45:03.250
I think you deserve
a wider audience.

45:04.400 --> 45:07.957
Weyland: Albert Einstein has
engaged in a profit-grubbing

45:07.958 --> 45:10.585
promotion of his theory,
as our country suffers

45:10.586 --> 45:13.278
deprivation and indignity.

45:13.279 --> 45:15.457
And for what?

45:15.458 --> 45:19.719
For a lie, for a hoax.

45:19.720 --> 45:23.249
For a deception
unlike any other.

45:23.951 --> 45:27.187
Over the next two days, you
will hear from Germany's most

45:27.188 --> 45:30.200
preeminent scholars, who
will show you exactly how

45:30.201 --> 45:33.630
we've all been hoodwinked
by one enormous bluff.

45:33.631 --> 45:35.845
Einstein: Hear, hear!

45:38.149 --> 45:39.143
Oh, apologies.

45:39.144 --> 45:40.488
Continue, doctor Weyland.

45:40.489 --> 45:43.245
We all eagerly await
your scholarly proof.

45:43.246 --> 45:45.748
I'm sure it will be
very interesting.

45:46.483 --> 45:47.571
Elsa: What in God's
name were you thinking?!

45:47.572 --> 45:49.077
Einstein: It was a public
lecture and I was curious,

45:49.078 --> 45:50.456
so I went.

45:50.457 --> 45:52.700
I admit I didn't expect much,
but I also didn't expect it

45:52.701 --> 45:56.581
to be a packed house of
anti-Semitic imbeciles.

45:58.021 --> 45:59.302
Elsa: What are you doing?

45:59.303 --> 46:00.680
Einstein: Writing to the
Berliner Tageblatt to give

46:00.681 --> 46:02.378
my honest critique.

46:02.379 --> 46:03.692
Elsa: Albert, stop.

46:03.693 --> 46:05.712
You are sticking your
hand into a hornet's nest.

46:05.713 --> 46:07.892
These men are vindictive
and dangerous.

46:07.893 --> 46:09.878
Einstein: This world is
dangerous, Elsa, not because

46:09.879 --> 46:11.866
of those who do evil,
but because of those who

46:11.867 --> 46:14.590
look on and do nothing.

46:14.591 --> 46:16.352
I cannot do nothing.

46:16.353 --> 46:19.493
Lenard: "I admire Lenard as a
master of experimental physics.

46:19.494 --> 46:21.833
But he has not yet produced
anything outstanding

46:21.834 --> 46:23.564
in theoretical physics."

46:23.565 --> 46:25.967
Katharina: He wrote that?

46:25.968 --> 46:28.372
Lenard: On the front
of the damn newspaper!

46:28.373 --> 46:31.705
Jewish publishers, of course.

46:31.706 --> 46:34.878
"Lenard's objections to the
general theory of relativity

46:34.879 --> 46:37.602
are of such superficiality
that, up until now,

46:37.603 --> 46:40.423
I did not think it
necessary to answer them.

46:40.424 --> 46:43.214
I intend to make up for this."

46:46.289 --> 46:49.204
It's an affront!

46:49.205 --> 46:50.175
I will not stand for it!

46:50.176 --> 46:52.153
Katharina: Why would he assume
that you had anything to do

46:52.154 --> 46:53.628
with that lecture series?

46:53.629 --> 46:56.223
You did not even attend!

46:56.224 --> 46:59.716
Lenard: That huckster Weyland
listed me as a coming

46:59.717 --> 47:01.224
lecturer in the program.

47:01.225 --> 47:05.426
No doubt trying to add
my prestige to his cause.

47:07.699 --> 47:09.268
But it doesn't matter,

47:09.269 --> 47:13.471
Einstein obviously desires
a public battle,

47:15.134 --> 47:17.701
perhaps it's time I
enlisted some public allies.
