00:08.967 --> 00:10.552
Excuse me.
There's a line, buddy.

00:10.719 --> 00:11.512
There's two lines.

00:11.678 --> 00:14.389
No, no, there's one line.
We're in it.

00:14.556 --> 00:16.225
I'm just getting a hot dog.

00:16.391 --> 00:17.643
We're all getting hot dogs.

00:17.809 --> 00:20.437
What, you think
there's two lines
and we're all in this line--

00:20.479 --> 00:22.856
you're the only genius
that got in the other line?

00:23.023 --> 00:27.069
Can you believe this guy?
Don't line up behind him.

00:27.238 --> 00:28.110
He cheated you.

00:28.273 --> 00:29.361
Hey, shut up.

00:29.537 --> 00:30.573
What do you want
on yours, baby?

00:30.739 --> 00:32.822
I want all the hot dogs,
please.

00:32.996 --> 00:34.491
Yeah, I'm--I'm buying
all the hot dogs.

00:34.668 --> 00:37.371
Oh, come on, lady.

00:37.537 --> 00:41.453
And I'm giving them
to the good people.

00:41.627 --> 00:44.043
Who's that?
Kicking it down the street

00:44.216 --> 00:47.133
Causin' a stir.

00:47.425 --> 00:49.921
Who's that?
I know that you're wondrin'

00:50.095 --> 00:50.421
That's her

00:50.596 --> 00:53.633
That's her, that's her,
that's her, that's her.

00:53.807 --> 00:56.800
Who's got
the kind of charisma that

00:56.977 --> 00:59.931
The boys prefer.

01:00.226 --> 01:02.473
Who's hot
and you know that she knows it.

01:02.646 --> 01:03.182
That's her.

01:03.358 --> 01:06.270
She's like a summer sky.
It's like some cherry pie.

01:06.447 --> 01:08.481
And there is butterfly.

01:08.657 --> 01:09.770
Me oh my.

01:09.946 --> 01:12.361
Who flaunts her feminine magic.

01:12.536 --> 01:14.241
That's her
That's me!

01:14.406 --> 01:15.322
That's Pam!

01:15.487 --> 01:18.282
The overly-confident
morbidly obese woman.

01:18.457 --> 01:21.081
This fat suit
smells like corn chips.

01:21.246 --> 01:23.160
Going again, please.
Thank you.

01:23.338 --> 01:25.212
And this is the set
of The Girlie Show.

01:25.376 --> 01:28.883
It's a real fun
ladies' comedy show for ladies.

01:29.046 --> 01:29.920
Hey, everybody.

01:30.098 --> 01:31.800
Look, here's someone
you never get a chance to meet.

01:31.965 --> 01:37.011
It's the head writer
of The Girlie Show, Liz Lemon!

01:41.015 --> 01:44.141
The Girlie Show.
Hold on, I'll connect you.

01:44.318 --> 01:45.933
- Hey.
- What's up?

01:46.108 --> 01:47.270
Hey, have you looked
at that Cat Lady sketch?

01:47.445 --> 01:48.692
It's still
seven minutes long.

01:48.856 --> 01:49.770
Yikes, okay.

01:49.945 --> 01:52.442
Oh, and Standards has a problem
with that Michael Jackson bit.

01:52.617 --> 01:53.230
But why?

01:53.408 --> 01:54.901
Apparently you can't say
he's got a vagina.

01:55.078 --> 01:57.321
Oh, it's--fine, I'll just
take the whole thing out.

01:57.497 --> 02:00.742
Hey, you gotta tell that NBC page
to take it down a notch.

02:00.917 --> 02:01.453
Oh, you mean Ken?

02:01.628 --> 02:03.370
Yeah, he just embarrassed me
in front of a whole tour group.

02:03.546 --> 02:05.290
I'll talk to him.
What is this?

02:05.455 --> 02:08.170
Ah, well, you know how I hate it
when people cheat or break rules?

02:08.335 --> 02:08.960
Yes, I do.

02:09.127 --> 02:11.341
Well, I just spent
150 bucks on wieners.

02:11.507 --> 02:14.051
Atta boy.

02:14.348 --> 02:15.380
Chumley.

02:15.557 --> 02:17.721
The beverage situation
around here is reprehensible.

02:17.886 --> 02:19.473
Oh, good morning, sunshine.

02:19.646 --> 02:25.472
Surely our massive conglomerate parent company
could spring for a samovar of coffee.

02:25.646 --> 02:27.851
Yeah, or like
a big coffee dispenser.

02:28.027 --> 02:29.810
That's what a samovar is.

02:29.985 --> 02:33.480
Are there other black nerds,
or is it just you and Urkel?

02:33.655 --> 02:36.243
Uh, Cerie, do you wanna
get some coffee?

02:36.408 --> 02:38.112
No, thank you.

02:38.287 --> 02:40.070
No?

02:40.246 --> 02:40.912
Hey, Josh.

02:41.075 --> 02:42.622
I need to change
your Michael Jackson thing.

02:42.787 --> 02:44.791
Didn't you tell me you had
a Jay Leno impression?

02:44.956 --> 02:45.333
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

02:45.495 --> 02:46.791
Check it out.

02:46.955 --> 02:49.331
So, uh, President Bush
is in the news again.

02:49.506 --> 02:50.671
Have you heard about this?

02:50.837 --> 02:51.880
No, Jay Leno.

02:52.045 --> 02:53.343
The host of the Tonight Show.

02:53.508 --> 02:55.342
I thought that's what
I was doing.

02:55.507 --> 02:58.840
So, uh, my wife Mavis and I like
to go shopping for old cars.

02:59.015 --> 02:59.512
You know?

02:59.687 --> 03:01.183
No,  no. Like Jay Leno.

03:01.347 --> 03:03.142
Like, "Hey, here are
the headlines."

03:03.306 --> 03:07.063
You ever--you ever notice
when you eat a lot of cheese, and you--

03:07.228 --> 03:09.021
How is that different
from what I was doing, though?

03:09.187 --> 03:13.113
And I don't think you need to
introduce the writers to the tour group.

03:13.276 --> 03:14.310
I agree.

03:14.487 --> 03:17.111
I thought they would find it interesting,
but they really did not.

03:17.287 --> 03:19.741
Well, Kenneth,
just respect their privacy.

03:19.908 --> 03:21.282
I promise I'll do better,
Mr. Hornberger.

03:21.456 --> 03:22.071
Sure you will.

03:22.248 --> 03:26.242
I just--
I just love television so much.

03:26.415 --> 03:28.042
We all do.

03:28.208 --> 03:30.962
Liz, they want you and Pete
on the 50th floor.

03:31.127 --> 03:31.871
Who, Gary?

03:32.045 --> 03:33.382
Tell him I'll be up
in half an hour.

03:33.547 --> 03:35.503
No, they said now.

03:35.676 --> 03:37.631
If they got cookies up there,
grab some.

03:37.805 --> 03:39.211
Ooh, and get them to pay
for my Samovar.

03:39.387 --> 03:41.343
Of course, I mean,
I assume that's what we're meeting about.

03:41.516 --> 03:44.141
What about, uh, Ray Romano?
Can you do Ray?

03:44.308 --> 03:47.472
Hey. God, oh. Debra.

03:47.648 --> 03:48.563
There you go.

03:48.728 --> 03:51.892
My brother's tall.
Right?

03:52.065 --> 03:52.942
Are we in trouble
or something?

03:53.106 --> 03:55.061
No way.
Gary loves the show.

03:55.237 --> 03:57.150
Pleased with the ratings.

03:57.327 --> 04:01.203
Right. Of course.
They love us.

04:05.496 --> 04:08.292
Where's Gary?

04:08.707 --> 04:11.582
Gary's dead.
I'm Jack Donaghy.

04:11.756 --> 04:14.792
New VP of development
for NBC/GE/Universal/Kmart.

04:14.968 --> 04:16.002
Oh, we own Kmart now.

04:16.178 --> 04:20.462
No. So why are you dressed
like we do?

04:23.478 --> 04:24.382
I'm surprised
you're renovating.

04:24.558 --> 04:25.892
This is
such a nice office.

04:26.056 --> 04:28.432
It's a great office, but sometimes,
you have to change things

04:28.606 --> 04:32.312
that are perfectly good just to, uh,
make them your own.

04:32.486 --> 04:34.902
Please.

04:35.448 --> 04:37.862
Ah, I'll call her back.
Is she at the White House line?

04:38.028 --> 04:39.361
Great.

04:39.537 --> 04:42.443
Tell them I need
a 4:00 a.m. tee off time.

04:42.617 --> 04:46.530
Uh, five inches,
but it's thick.

04:47.286 --> 04:51.253
Are you familiar with
the GE Tri-vection Oven?

04:51.416 --> 04:52.791
I don't cook very much.

04:52.965 --> 04:55.083
Sure, I got you.

04:55.257 --> 04:58.092
New York, third wave feminist,
college educated.

04:58.255 --> 04:59.960
Single and pretending
to be happy about it.

05:00.135 --> 05:02.593
Overscheduled, undersexed,
you buy any magazine

05:02.766 --> 05:04.842
that says "Healthy body image"
on the cover.

05:05.017 --> 05:09.643
And  every two years,
you take up knitting for...

05:09.817 --> 05:10.970
A week.

05:11.145 --> 05:12.602
That is dead on!

05:12.778 --> 05:14.351
What, are you gonna
guess my weight now?

05:14.528 --> 05:15.813
You  don't want me
to do that.

05:15.986 --> 05:18.980
That knitting thing is uncanny.
How do you do that?

05:19.158 --> 05:20.613
Market research, my friend.

05:20.777 --> 05:25.531
Years and years of market research,
which lead to my greatest triumph.

05:25.706 --> 05:28.281
The Tri-vection oven.

05:28.457 --> 05:30.080
Oh, my wife
wants one of those.

05:30.246 --> 05:31.620
Could we get Pete
an oven, please?

05:31.795 --> 05:32.043
Hey.

05:32.208 --> 05:35.082
The GE Tri-vection oven cooks
perfect food five times faster

05:35.258 --> 05:37.713
than a conventional oven,
because it uses three kinds of heat.

05:37.888 --> 05:40.252
Thermal technology
for consistent temperature.

05:40.426 --> 05:44.050
GE Precise Air convection technology
for optimal air circulation,

05:44.216 --> 05:47.632
and microwave technology
for incredible speed.

05:47.803 --> 05:53.521
With three kinds of heat,
you can cook a turkey in 22 minutes.

05:53.937 --> 05:56.353
Wow.
That is impressive.

05:56.529 --> 05:58.232
The people upstairs think so.

05:58.407 --> 05:59.313
That's why they promoted me.

05:59.485 --> 06:02.193
That's why they sent me here
to retool your show.

06:02.365 --> 06:03.733
Retool what now?

06:03.906 --> 06:05.861
I'm the new vice president of
east coast television

06:06.036 --> 06:08.111
and microwave oven programming.

06:08.288 --> 06:12.162
That sounds like you program
microwave ovens.

06:12.338 --> 06:14.043
I like you.

06:14.206 --> 06:18.962
You have the boldness
of a much younger woman.

06:21.177 --> 06:24.590
Lee, does my face
look bloated to you?

06:24.767 --> 06:27.671
When I played that lady rapist
on Law & Order,

06:27.848 --> 06:29.842
guess what the makeup guy
put on under my eyes

06:30.016 --> 06:31.511
to take the puffiness out?

06:31.688 --> 06:34.682
Hemorrhoid cream.

06:37.856 --> 06:38.442
Ms. Maroney?

06:38.608 --> 06:40.061
I have the cat wrangler
here for you.

06:40.236 --> 06:42.812
Oh, is it that
horrible little--Hi.

06:42.985 --> 06:46.782
Hey. Greta Johannsen.
It's short for "LaGreta."

06:46.948 --> 06:47.901
Hi, great to see you again.

06:48.077 --> 06:49.203
You too. I'm here
to introduce you

06:49.366 --> 06:51.371
to feline actors
you're gonna be working with tonight.

06:51.537 --> 06:51.992
Okay.

06:52.167 --> 06:54.452
This is Po-Po.
And this here is Captain Boots.

06:54.628 --> 06:55.121
Hello.

06:55.298 --> 06:57.410
Uh, would you describe yourself
as "cat competent?"

06:57.585 --> 07:00.872
Oh, yes. I love cats.
I used to have two cats.

07:01.048 --> 07:02.792
But then I moved to this place
with hardwood floors,

07:02.968 --> 07:06.592
so we had to
put them down.

07:07.398 --> 07:08.722
I'm joking.

07:08.886 --> 07:10.722
I've done several focus groups,
on this show,

07:10.885 --> 07:12.891
and what I've gleaned--

07:13.058 --> 07:17.270
The blonde, big-eyed girl
is popular with women and older gays.

07:17.436 --> 07:18.890
Jenna, that's
my friend Jenna.

07:19.068 --> 07:21.481
And the kid with the funny hair
is liked by women,

07:21.658 --> 07:25.733
but you're missing men
between 18 and 49.

07:25.905 --> 07:28.281
I'm not missing them,
they're just not there.

07:28.448 --> 07:30.200
I think I can fix that.

07:30.365 --> 07:34.833
So your job is, you take things
that are already working, and you fix them.

07:34.996 --> 07:35.662
That's a great job.

07:35.836 --> 07:36.913
Okay, let's--
Why don't we, um--

07:37.088 --> 07:39.793
You're missing
that third kind of heat.

07:39.966 --> 07:42.083
I want you to think about
Tracy Jordan.

07:42.258 --> 07:43.711
Okay--the black guy?

07:43.887 --> 07:44.962
The black movie star.

07:45.138 --> 07:47.341
I flew with him on a private jet
to the Super Bowl recently,

07:47.506 --> 07:49.012
and I found him very entertaining.

07:49.176 --> 07:52.510
Isn't he, um...
crazy?

07:52.938 --> 07:55.220
Tracy's had his problems
in the last few years.

07:55.397 --> 07:57.473
I am a Jedi!

07:57.647 --> 07:59.643
I am a Jedi!

07:59.817 --> 08:01.690
I am a Jedi!

08:01.858 --> 08:05.312
The important thing to remember is,
he was never charged with a crime.

08:05.485 --> 08:07.361
It's not illegal to fall asleep
on your neighbor's roof.

08:07.527 --> 08:08.610
Nor should it be.

08:08.785 --> 08:12.570
Tracy Jordan is the third heat.

08:12.746 --> 08:16.331
I don't know where we're gonna
find room in the budget for a guy like Tracy Jordan.

08:16.496 --> 08:19.290
I think I do.

08:20.796 --> 08:22.160
What are you doing?

08:22.337 --> 08:23.923
Sometimes when I have
these stress dreams,

08:24.086 --> 08:28.000
if I go to sleep in the dream,
I come out of it.

08:28.177 --> 08:31.013
"This is not a dream."

08:31.177 --> 08:33.131
Tracy Jordan is
in New York today, Liz.

08:33.307 --> 08:35.181
I'd  like you
to have lunch with him.

08:35.346 --> 08:37.051
We have a show tonight,
Mr. Donaghy.

08:37.227 --> 08:38.720
I don't know if your research
covered this,

08:38.895 --> 08:41.393
but we do a dress rehearsal,
and then a live show.

08:41.566 --> 08:43.270
That's tonight.
This is lunch.

08:43.448 --> 08:46.400
If it's not a good fit,
I'll drop the whole thing.

08:46.568 --> 08:49.070
If I meet with Tracy Jordan,
and we mutually agree

08:49.236 --> 08:52.531
that this is the worst idea ever,
you'll back off?

08:52.696 --> 08:56.570
I'm known
for being reasonable.

08:57.916 --> 08:58.780
Okay.

08:58.955 --> 09:00.371
Alfredo, 2:00 p.m.

09:00.548 --> 09:01.873
I'm not dressed for that.

09:02.048 --> 09:03.040
You're dressed
for Burger King.

09:03.216 --> 09:06.960
Should we make it
Burger King?

09:07.135 --> 09:07.841
Pete, hang back for me.

09:08.008 --> 09:10.841
Yeah, you bet.

09:18.267 --> 09:19.933
Hey.
What happened to your head?

09:20.107 --> 09:21.563
Uh, the sky is falling.

09:21.728 --> 09:22.890
Do you have a pair
of dress pants

09:23.065 --> 09:25.521
or a skirt or something
I could borrow?

09:25.696 --> 09:26.521
Thank you, Lee.

09:26.695 --> 09:27.230
Whatever.

09:27.406 --> 09:29.062
Hey, you know
in that Cat Lady sketch?

09:29.236 --> 09:30.651
Do I have to hold
a real cat?

09:30.826 --> 09:33.032
Cat Lady sketch?
That thing's gonna get cut.

09:33.197 --> 09:35.113
Oh, good.

09:35.285 --> 09:36.913
Who's that?

09:37.078 --> 09:38.622
That is
the new network dude.

09:38.787 --> 09:40.741
Mmm, yummers.

09:40.916 --> 09:42.871
He reminds me of Scotty
on General Hospital.

09:43.047 --> 09:45.212
What? No, ew, Jenna.
Do not like that man.

09:45.375 --> 09:48.881
That is a bad man.
God, you have a gift.

09:49.047 --> 09:52.462
Laura Bush
is your size.

09:59.015 --> 10:01.260
Hi, uh, what are you
doing down here?

10:01.435 --> 10:03.311
I'm known for being
hands-on.

10:03.478 --> 10:04.522
Clearly.

10:04.686 --> 10:06.773
That's how you should dress
for work, by the way.

10:06.945 --> 10:11.572
Yeah, if I was president
of the Philippines.

10:12.367 --> 10:15.820
Afghanistan is a different
situation...

10:15.996 --> 10:17.202
I'll have an apple juice.

10:17.368 --> 10:18.950
Oh, we don't have
apple juice, sir.

10:19.116 --> 10:23.082
Then I'll take
a vodka and tonic.

10:23.585 --> 10:25.121
Hi, I'm Liz Lemon.

10:25.297 --> 10:28.423
I know who you are.

10:30.257 --> 10:33.671
I thought there was a...
strict dress code at this place.

10:33.847 --> 10:35.631
I do recommend
the pumpkin ravioli.

10:35.807 --> 10:38.682
They're very subtle.

10:38.845 --> 10:41.763
So, Tracy, this Jack Donaghy guy
wanted me

10:41.936 --> 10:44.472
to talk to you about
joining the cast of our show.

10:44.647 --> 10:46.063
And I don't know
how you feel about that--

10:46.237 --> 10:49.063
Lemme ask you a question.
Everybody at this table.

10:49.236 --> 10:51.362
Did he just say the word
"pumpkin" to me?

10:51.525 --> 10:53.942
Yes, um, pumpkin ravioli.

10:54.117 --> 10:55.902
Yo! I'm buggin'.

10:56.078 --> 10:58.452
I can't do this.
I cannot eat here.

10:58.615 --> 10:59.322
I can't eat here.

10:59.498 --> 11:04.790
I got to go someplace where they
make food that I like.

11:04.995 --> 11:06.792
Lemon, let's go.

11:06.955 --> 11:08.660
I will not work
with Tracy Jordan.

11:08.837 --> 11:09.542
It's just a rumor.

11:09.717 --> 11:10.872
Have you seen
any of his movies?

11:11.046 --> 11:13.043
The guy's sensibility
is just cretinous.

11:13.216 --> 11:15.753
I saw the one where he plays, like,
five different characters.

11:15.925 --> 11:17.593
Yeah, Black Cop/White Cop.

11:17.767 --> 11:18.970
No.

11:19.135 --> 11:20.340
Who  Dat Ninja?

11:20.515 --> 11:23.471
No, he-- He had to pretend
to be this old lady...

11:23.646 --> 11:26.890
Ooh, ooh, ooh!
Goodness gracious!

11:27.067 --> 11:28.520
You hooligans
better watch out.

11:28.688 --> 11:31.350
'Cause this honky grandma
be trippin'!

11:31.528 --> 11:32.270
Oh, yeah.

11:32.446 --> 11:37.481
That movie was hilarious.
I saw it like five times.

11:38.617 --> 11:41.613
Where's the love?

11:43.246 --> 11:47.542
Right on, let me get two apple chickens
and some pecan waffles.

11:47.706 --> 11:48.661
Nothing for me, I--

11:48.836 --> 11:51.210
I had, like,
four hot dogs this morning.

11:51.376 --> 11:52.713
Eat, Lemon.
Eat!

11:52.888 --> 11:54.793
I hate skinny women.

11:54.966 --> 11:58.301
Hey, Lorna.
Ten beers.

11:58.767 --> 12:00.922
So, Tracy, we should talk
about the show.

12:01.095 --> 12:03.341
Yeah, I ain't doing it
unless I can get to do it my way.

12:03.516 --> 12:04.763
You know,
I want it to be raw.

12:04.936 --> 12:06.392
HBO-style content.

12:06.568 --> 12:08.430
Well, it's not HBO.
It's TV.

12:08.608 --> 12:10.390
And I don't think
that it's a good fit--

12:10.576 --> 12:12.730
You know, cause
I wanna drop truth bombs.

12:12.908 --> 12:15.901
You know how pissed off I was
when Us Weekly said that I was on crack?

12:16.068 --> 12:18.610
That's racism.
I'm not on crack.

12:18.786 --> 12:20.192
I'm straight up
mentally ill!

12:20.368 --> 12:21.150
Sure.

12:21.327 --> 12:23.032
I got mental health issues.

12:23.208 --> 12:27.740
Sure, well, you know...
Who doesn't, really?

12:27.915 --> 12:30.410
Hey, has anyone seen Liz?
Or Pete?

12:30.587 --> 12:31.372
She went out.

12:31.547 --> 12:33.290
Well, who's in charge
when they're not here?

12:33.465 --> 12:34.421
I'm in charge.

12:34.586 --> 12:36.253
Oh. Okay.

12:36.426 --> 12:39.760
Um, well, I'm not sure
about this costume.

12:39.926 --> 12:40.920
I think it's hot.

12:41.098 --> 12:43.933
Thank you.
I'm Jenna, by the way.

12:44.096 --> 12:49.142
Ms. Moroney, I got
the hemorrhoid cream you wanted.

12:50.526 --> 12:52.982
It's for my face.

12:53.148 --> 12:58.440
Well, wherever you're putting it,
I think it's working.

13:00.447 --> 13:01.692
You know, I don't--
I don't think you'd like it.

13:01.866 --> 13:02.692
'Cause we work
a lot of hours,

13:02.866 --> 13:04.703
and it's live TV,
which is risky.

13:04.865 --> 13:06.321
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
I like risky.

13:06.496 --> 13:07.910
See, me and you,
we play the game.

13:08.087 --> 13:09.203
We know how to be
acceptable.

13:09.376 --> 13:12.962
Hello, great meeting.
I drink coffee, please.

13:13.126 --> 13:15.422
This show is our chance
to break the shackles.

13:15.588 --> 13:17.790
'Cause the white dudes
want to see us fail.

13:17.966 --> 13:19.002
What white dudes?

13:19.175 --> 13:20.753
All of 'em.

13:20.927 --> 13:24.343
Jack Donaghy, General Electric,
George Bush, Karl Robe.

13:24.515 --> 13:26.222
Karl Robe, you say?

13:26.396 --> 13:28.013
Affirmative action
was designed to keep women

13:28.186 --> 13:30.010
and minorities in competition
with each other.

13:30.185 --> 13:34.431
To distract us while white dudes inject AIDS
into our chicken nuggets.

13:34.607 --> 13:36.483
That's a metaphor.

13:36.655 --> 13:37.560
Sure.

13:37.735 --> 13:41.781
You should tell that
to Us Weekly.

13:42.827 --> 13:43.242
Hey, Lemon.

13:43.405 --> 13:45.321
You like karaoke?
I know a joint.

13:45.498 --> 13:50.742
No, no, I--
I gotta wrap up this lunch meeting, Tracy.

13:50.915 --> 13:52.702
I'll take you.
I'll take you.

13:52.875 --> 13:57.083
I just gotta make
a quick stop first.

14:00.465 --> 14:02.462
You know what, when people say
they need to make a quick stop,

14:02.637 --> 14:06.131
they usually mean at the bank
or the store.

14:06.305 --> 14:08.510
No, thank you.

14:08.687 --> 14:11.262
You know what, this is for
computer classes.

14:11.437 --> 14:13.221
Know why I should do
this TV show, Lemon?

14:13.395 --> 14:14.732
I really don't.

14:14.898 --> 14:16.061
To get you rich.

14:16.238 --> 14:17.391
'Cause you know
if I'm on that TV show,

14:17.566 --> 14:18.691
it's gon' blow up.

14:18.856 --> 14:20.901
How do you know
I'm not rich?

14:21.066 --> 14:22.901
Your teeth.

14:23.077 --> 14:24.993
You got to think
like these strippers, Lemon.

14:25.158 --> 14:27.782
They know the window of opportunity's
only open for a moment.

14:27.958 --> 14:29.162
You gotta get in
when you're young.

14:29.327 --> 14:30.871
Get the money
and get out.

14:31.038 --> 14:32.531
Yeah, well,
I'm not a sex worker, Tracy.

14:32.707 --> 14:33.871
I don't have sex
for a living.

14:34.045 --> 14:35.121
Neither do we.

14:35.297 --> 14:39.083
Neither do they.
Yes, they do.

14:41.000 --> 14:47.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

14:49.097 --> 14:52.180
Where is my phone?

14:56.738 --> 14:59.523
We are strong

15:00.526 --> 15:04.321
No one can tell us
we're wrong

15:05.618 --> 15:09.663
Searching our hearts
for so lo-ong

15:10.247 --> 15:11.241
He's got charisma.

15:11.417 --> 15:15.293
No, that's Charisma
over there.

15:17.508 --> 15:18.252
Girlie Show.

15:18.418 --> 15:20.083
Ken, send me a car, okay?

15:20.257 --> 15:21.583
What is your location?

15:21.758 --> 15:24.630
Dark Sensations,
in the Bronx.

15:24.807 --> 15:25.880
I wish you were here.

15:26.057 --> 15:28.630
Mr. Donaghy does not get
us showbiz people.

15:28.807 --> 15:30.301
Let me talk to Pete, okay?

15:30.478 --> 15:32.893
Oh, Pete got fired this morning.

15:33.057 --> 15:37.520
That's so weird
that you don't know that.

15:41.908 --> 15:44.111
Jack Donaghy thinks
he's gonna come into my house

15:44.277 --> 15:45.481
and mess with my show?

15:45.655 --> 15:47.073
Hell no.

15:47.237 --> 15:49.820
Jenna and I worked
for years to get this show.

15:49.995 --> 15:52.742
You know, I moved
from Chicago for this.

15:52.918 --> 15:53.661
From Chicago?

15:53.827 --> 15:55.623
I was in
Scottie Pippen's wedding.

15:55.786 --> 15:58.453
Now Donaghy is trying
to steal it from us.

15:58.628 --> 16:02.373
He already fired Pete,
who is a great producer.

16:02.545 --> 16:04.790
He fired Pete?
He can't fire Pete.

16:04.968 --> 16:07.051
You know what, I quit.
He can suck it.

16:07.215 --> 16:08.380
Mm-hmm.

16:08.556 --> 16:10.260
Yeah, suck it, Pete.

16:10.428 --> 16:14.220
No, you're not listening.
You're not a good listener.

16:14.395 --> 16:15.550
20 minutes to air.

16:15.726 --> 16:17.472
But Liz said we were cutting
the cat lady sketch.

16:17.647 --> 16:18.522
She said it stinks.

16:18.685 --> 16:19.021
Ouch.

16:19.185 --> 16:22.600
This is why Liz is wrong.
Animal humour is universal.

16:22.775 --> 16:24.653
I just don't think
that I'm good in it.

16:24.817 --> 16:25.902
Do you think
I'm good in it?

16:26.068 --> 16:29.031
I think this is your opportunity to go out there
and prove everybody wrong.

16:29.195 --> 16:30.780
What--what do you mean?
Who's everybody?

16:30.946 --> 16:32.200
The  network that wanted
to fire you,

16:32.365 --> 16:34.362
the focus groups that said
you had a weird eye--

16:34.535 --> 16:36.203
You mean this eye?
Okay, this eye--

16:36.377 --> 16:38.913
It doesn't open all the way
because when I was little, my sister peed in it.

16:39.087 --> 16:42.001
Tonight is your opportunity to go out there
and change all of our minds.

16:42.165 --> 16:45.291
What?
Where is Liz?

16:46.757 --> 16:49.052
Liz?!

17:00.727 --> 17:02.731
Four minutes to air.
That's four minutes to air.

17:02.898 --> 17:03.443
Is Liz back yet?

17:03.607 --> 17:06.192
No, which cat
do you want Jenna to carry?

17:06.367 --> 17:06.692
I'm sorry?

17:06.865 --> 17:07.943
Which cat?

17:08.115 --> 17:09.361
Oh.

17:09.538 --> 17:12.611
I want...that one.

17:13.285 --> 17:16.281
Jack Donaghy to the control room,
please. Jack Donaghy.

17:16.458 --> 17:17.200
Peanut's not an actor.

17:17.377 --> 17:21.660
I just--I just
rescued him from a lab.

17:24.507 --> 17:26.080
Hey, Lemon,
I'll drop you off.

17:26.258 --> 17:28.920
Where do you live?

17:29.098 --> 17:29.920
The studio.

17:30.098 --> 17:31.380
I want you to drop me
at the studio.

17:31.557 --> 17:33.843
I want to tell Donaghey
to his face that I quit.

17:34.018 --> 17:35.633
And I want to do it
in front of the whole crew,

17:35.805 --> 17:39.143
so that they know
he didn't fire me.

17:39.308 --> 17:42.313
I wanna see that.

17:43.737 --> 17:44.893
Gonna turn the lights
down low.

17:45.068 --> 17:49.233
It's almost time
for the Girlie Show

17:50.868 --> 17:52.690
Ooh, ooh, pull over.
Pull over here.

17:52.867 --> 17:56.911
Tracy, I don't have time
for this.

17:59.956 --> 18:02.951
This is where I grew up.

18:03.128 --> 18:05.961
This is the Jordan
family estate?

18:06.126 --> 18:07.790
Wasn't no Jordan
family nothin'.

18:07.967 --> 18:10.092
This is where I was
in foster care.

18:10.255 --> 18:11.920
Oh. Sorry.

18:12.095 --> 18:16.590
Me and two other dudes
and a girl with messed-up fingers.

18:16.765 --> 18:20.641
I'm so lucky
I got out of here.

18:21.435 --> 18:23.352
It's not luck,
I mean...

18:23.528 --> 18:28.850
You got out of here because you're
very talented, and... people love you, and...

18:29.026 --> 18:31.942
Are you peeing?

18:37.208 --> 18:39.201
Where's Donaghy?
I wanna talk to him right now.

18:39.365 --> 18:41.202
Last time I saw him,
he was riding a crane camera.

18:41.377 --> 18:44.623
Oh, I have Pete for you.

18:44.798 --> 18:46.122
Pete, oh, my God.
I didn't know.

18:46.296 --> 18:48.042
No, hey, listen.
It'll--it'll give me

18:48.216 --> 18:49.833
a chance to spend more time
with my kids.

18:50.005 --> 18:51.502
I'm quitting.
I'm quitting right now.

18:51.677 --> 18:52.540
No, no, no, no, no.

18:52.715 --> 18:53.670
You have the best job
in New York.

18:53.845 --> 18:57.053
Don't quit over this.
Don't buy all the hot dogs. Okay?

18:57.227 --> 18:58.931
I don't want to do this
without you.

18:59.097 --> 19:03.601
Hey, I thought we cut
the Cat Lady sketch.

19:04.225 --> 19:07.603
We're two minutes short!

19:07.777 --> 19:12.403
So, let me introduce myself.
My name is Lurleen Katz.

19:12.566 --> 19:14.943
And these are my cats.

19:15.116 --> 19:17.400
She's using a real cat?

19:17.577 --> 19:18.860
I cast that cat myself.

19:19.035 --> 19:23.371
And sir, while they are my--
Ow! Aaugh!

19:27.008 --> 19:30.790
No, no, no, no, no.
He's okay.

19:31.175 --> 19:33.090
I need you to talk
for two minutes.

19:33.256 --> 19:34.043
About what?

19:34.215 --> 19:35.381
Anything.

19:35.555 --> 19:37.213
All right.

19:37.386 --> 19:40.181
These cats are more
than just pets, sir.

19:40.345 --> 19:41.590
Why, just this morning--

19:41.768 --> 19:43.682
Excuse me!
Where is the manager?

19:43.856 --> 19:50.060
I'm from the government,
and I'm here to inspect your chicken nuggets.

19:52.238 --> 19:53.902
Uh-oh.
Look at Shorty.

19:54.068 --> 19:57.942
This honky grandma
be trippin'.

20:00.248 --> 20:02.071
What's up, America?

20:02.246 --> 20:05.033
I'm coming
into your house live.

20:05.206 --> 20:07.703
Lemme hear you say
"We love you, Tracy."

20:07.877 --> 20:10.081
We love you, Tracy!

20:10.256 --> 20:13.462
I am the third heat!

20:17.096 --> 20:20.013
He's brilliant.

20:23.595 --> 20:24.343
Are you drunk?

20:24.517 --> 20:26.220
Yes.

20:26.397 --> 20:27.222
Why did you fire Pete?

20:27.398 --> 20:28.853
Why did you disappear
all night?

20:29.025 --> 20:30.232
Is this some kind
of a power play?

20:30.397 --> 20:31.272
Yeah, yeah.

20:31.448 --> 20:34.312
It's not so fun being "hands on"
with these bloodsuckers, is it?

20:34.485 --> 20:35.611
Could we talk about this
on Monday?

20:35.777 --> 20:37.821
No. I want Pete back.

20:37.987 --> 20:40.491
I want it in writing
that Jenna's job is safe,

20:40.655 --> 20:45.373
and I want a cappuccino machine
for the writers' room.

20:45.537 --> 20:46.580
Fine.

20:46.747 --> 20:47.700
I thought you were
going to quit.

20:47.876 --> 20:49.790
Yeah, well, you don't know
everything about me.

20:49.955 --> 20:53.210
You weigh 127 pounds.

20:55.588 --> 20:57.880
Yeah.

21:03.935 --> 21:07.262
Thank you,
good night.

21:07.557 --> 21:11.523
You will be hearing
from Peanut's lawyer.

21:11.687 --> 21:13.601
Good night,
sleep tight.

21:13.777 --> 21:18.401
I can't wait to do this
with you every week.
