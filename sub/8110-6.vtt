00:08.509 --> 00:09.410
[male announcer]
THIS ELECTION DAY,

00:09.443 --> 00:12.780
THE FATE OF OUR BORDERS
IS IN YOUR HANDS.

00:12.813 --> 00:15.149
*

00:15.183 --> 00:16.650
JOHN MORENO WANTS TO INVITE

00:16.684 --> 00:19.587
ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS
INTO OUR COUNTRY.

00:19.620 --> 00:22.490
HE WANTS TO GIVE THEM OUR JOBS.

00:22.523 --> 00:25.759
HE WANTS TO GIVE THEM
OUR HEALTHCARE.

00:25.793 --> 00:29.663
JOHN MORENO WANTS TO GIVE THEM
THE AMERICAN DREAM,

00:29.697 --> 00:32.566
AND HE WANTS YOU TO PAY FOR IT.

00:32.600 --> 00:33.567
[people yelling]

00:33.601 --> 00:36.604
*

00:40.774 --> 00:42.643
WHOSE SIDE IS HE REALLY ON?

00:42.676 --> 00:43.577
[beeping]
IT'S A VALID QUESTION.

00:43.611 --> 00:45.279
HE FAVORS EASING RESTRICTIONS.

00:45.313 --> 00:46.280
SO DO I.

00:46.314 --> 00:47.281
SHH.

00:47.315 --> 00:48.249
COME ON, HAL.

00:48.282 --> 00:50.584
YOUR POSITION ON WORK VISAS
IS IRRELEVANT.

00:50.618 --> 00:52.686
HE'S TALKING ABOUT
A PATH TO CITIZENSHIP.

00:52.720 --> 00:56.390
I'M TELLING YOU,
THIS AD WINS YOU THE ELECTION.

00:56.424 --> 00:58.126
BY INSULTING ONE
OF MY CORE CONSTITUENCIES.

00:58.159 --> 01:00.328
COME ON, IN '04

01:00.361 --> 01:01.862
I HAD 45%
OF THE LATINO VOTE.

01:01.895 --> 01:04.632
AND THIS YEAR YOU'RE RUNNING
AGAINST A GUY NAMED MORENO.

01:04.665 --> 01:05.499
THIS ISN'T
ONE OF YOUR RACES

01:05.533 --> 01:07.635
IN SOUTH CAROLINA
OR OKLAHOMA, JOE.

01:07.668 --> 01:09.603
THIS IS NEW JERSEY--
PEOPLE VOTE FOR ME

01:09.637 --> 01:11.705
BECAUSE I'M A MODERATE.
WELL,
THAT'S GREAT.

01:11.739 --> 01:14.642
YOU CAN BE THE MOST MODERATE
EX-SENATOR IN THE COUNTRY.

01:14.675 --> 01:17.745
HAL, THE ELECTION
IS SEVEN DAYS AWAY,

01:17.778 --> 01:21.582
AND EVEN OUR OWN INTERNALS SHOW
YOU DOWN SIX POINTS.

01:21.615 --> 01:22.583
WE'VE ALWAYS BEEN
THE UNDERDOG.

01:22.616 --> 01:25.419
AND WE'VE ALWAYS
FOUND A WAY TO WIN.
I KNOW.

01:25.453 --> 01:27.621
BECAUSE YOU HAVE ALWAYS LET ME
DO WHAT'S NEEDED TO BE DONE.

01:27.655 --> 01:31.192
NOW, I CAN HAVE THIS
ON THE AIR TOMORROW.

01:33.727 --> 01:35.163
NO, NO.

01:35.196 --> 01:36.697
COME ON, HAL,
LET ME DO THIS!

01:36.730 --> 01:37.598
NO, ABSOLUTELY NOT.

01:37.631 --> 01:39.467
THIS COULD TOTALLY
GALVANIZE THE LEFT.

01:40.668 --> 01:41.902
YOU ALL RIGHT, JOE?

01:41.935 --> 01:44.472
YEAH, I THINK I GOT
SOME KIND OF A RASH.

01:44.505 --> 01:45.639
WHAT THE HELL?

01:45.673 --> 01:46.707
THAT'S NOT A RASH.

01:46.740 --> 01:49.310
MAYBE I SHOULD
CALL A DOCTOR.

01:49.343 --> 01:50.878
YOU BETTER CALL
AN AMBULANCE.

01:53.914 --> 01:56.884
[Massive Attack's Teardrop]

01:56.917 --> 02:04.192
*

02:26.247 --> 02:27.215
(House)
LOOK AT IT LIKE THIS...

02:27.248 --> 02:28.849
OF ALL THE WAYS
TO RUPTURE IT,

02:28.882 --> 02:30.784
NOTHING HONORS
THE REAL ACHILLES MORE

02:30.818 --> 02:33.887
THAN BLOWING THE DISMOUNT
ON A KEG STAND.

02:33.921 --> 02:36.457
WHAT'S THAT SMELL?

02:36.490 --> 02:37.458
IS IT ONIONS?

02:37.491 --> 02:39.327
PEPPERS?

02:39.360 --> 02:40.594
OH, I KNOW...

02:40.628 --> 02:41.862
IT'S A SAUSAGEFEST.

02:41.895 --> 02:44.965
SAUSAGEFEST
IMPLIES MULTIPLES.

02:44.998 --> 02:46.300
NOW, IF YOU'RE TALKING
ABOUT YARDAGE,

02:46.334 --> 02:47.401
I'D HAVE TO AGREE.

02:47.435 --> 02:48.802
I'M TALKING
ABOUT YOUR DEPARTMENT.

02:48.836 --> 02:50.504
YOU STILL HAVEN'T
REPLACED THIRTEEN.

02:50.538 --> 02:52.473
IT'S COMING ALONG.

02:52.506 --> 02:54.275
YOU'VE HAD PLENTY OF TIME
TO FIND SOMEONE.

02:54.308 --> 02:56.510
I'VE FOUND PLENTY OF SOMEONES.
JUST HAVEN'T KEPT THEM.

02:56.544 --> 02:57.911
IT'S TIME TO END
THE CYCLE.

02:57.945 --> 02:59.680
MEET YOUR NEW TEAM MEMBER.

02:59.713 --> 03:01.649
HER NAME IS MARTHA M. MASTERS.

03:03.684 --> 03:05.319
THIS DOCTOR
IS NOT A DOCTOR.

03:05.353 --> 03:06.720
SHE'S A THIRD-YEAR
MED STUDENT.

03:06.754 --> 03:08.756
SHE GRADUATED HIGH SCHOOL
WHEN SHE WAS 15.

03:08.789 --> 03:10.658
SHE FILLED OUT THE TIME
BEFORE MED SCHOOL GETTING PHDS

03:10.691 --> 03:12.926
IN BOTH APPLIED MATH
AND ART HISTORY.

03:12.960 --> 03:14.428
SHE'LL BE
INCREDIBLY USEFUL

03:14.462 --> 03:16.630
IF MY NEXT PATIENT
IS AN ESCHER DRAWING.

03:16.664 --> 03:18.332
THOSE THINGS
ARE SERIOUSLY SCREWED UP.

03:18.366 --> 03:19.733
THIS ISN'T A SUGGESTION.

03:19.767 --> 03:22.970
JUST BECAUSE MY SAUSAGE
HAS BEEN FILLING YOUR BUN

03:23.003 --> 03:24.772
DOESN'T MEAN
YOU GET TO DECIDE

03:24.805 --> 03:27.941
WHAT FLAVOR CHIPS I NOSH ON
DURING THE DAY.

03:27.975 --> 03:31.211
NOPE, I GET TO DO THAT
BECAUSE I'M YOUR BOSS.

03:36.417 --> 03:38.686
PATIENT IS JOE DUGAN, 42,
POLITICAL CONSULTANT.

03:38.719 --> 03:40.854
PRESENTS
WITH PALPABLE PURPURA,

03:40.888 --> 03:42.756
AND ALT AND AST
ARE THROUGH THE ROOF.

03:42.790 --> 03:45.025
OTHERWISE KNOWN
AS RASH AND LIVER DAMAGE.

03:45.058 --> 03:45.893
FASCINATING.

03:45.926 --> 03:47.861
SENATOR ANDERSON
SENT THIS CASE TO US,

03:47.895 --> 03:49.663
AND PERSONALLY REQUESTED
WE TAKE A LOOK.

03:49.697 --> 03:51.999
THAT'S REASON ENOUGH
FOR ME.

03:52.032 --> 03:53.767
BLACK GUY CAMPAIGNING
FOR THE OPPOSITION?

03:53.801 --> 03:54.735
DOES OBAMA KNOW ABOUT THIS?

03:54.768 --> 03:56.937
I TRIED CALLING HIM
ON THE BROTHER HOTLINE.

03:56.970 --> 03:57.938
HE DIDN'T PICK UP.

03:57.971 --> 03:58.972
[knock on door]

04:05.646 --> 04:08.749
MARTHA M. MASTERS.

04:08.782 --> 04:10.418
I'M DR. HOUSE.

04:10.451 --> 04:12.320
THIS IS
THE REST OF THE TEAM.

04:12.353 --> 04:14.021
BORING, BIMBO,
AND BITE-SIZE.

04:14.054 --> 04:15.723
MARTHA ENJOYS
QUADRATIC EQUATIONS,

04:15.756 --> 04:18.392
ITALIAN FRESCOES,
AND HER TURN-ONS INCLUDE

04:18.426 --> 04:19.427
LEARNING TO BE A DOCTOR.

04:21.061 --> 04:22.029
TAKE A SEAT.

04:22.062 --> 04:24.398
SHE'S A MED STUDENT?

04:24.432 --> 04:27.535
CUDDY THINKS
SHE'S SOME KIND OF GENIUS.

04:27.568 --> 04:30.571
SAY SOMETHING BRILLIANT.

04:30.604 --> 04:31.605
OH, I--I DON'T--

04:31.639 --> 04:33.474

04:33.507 --> 04:34.575

04:35.843 --> 04:37.678

OF EULER'S NUMBER?

04:37.711 --> 04:38.746
SIX.

04:38.779 --> 04:40.748
[Masters giggles]

04:40.781 --> 04:41.982
IT'S MY FAVORITE CONSTANT.

04:42.015 --> 04:45.486
(House)
WITH BREASTS.E INTERNET

04:45.519 --> 04:46.887
OH, NO, WAIT--
THE INTERNET HAS BREASTS.

04:46.920 --> 04:48.055
(Foreman)
OUR PATIENT'S LIVER DAMAGE

04:48.088 --> 04:49.523
EXPLAINS THE RASH
AND CRYOGLOBULINS

04:49.557 --> 04:50.491
WE FOUND IN HIS BLOOD,

04:50.524 --> 04:52.426
BUT WE CAN'T EXPLAIN
THE LIVER DAMAGE.

04:52.460 --> 04:54.628
SHOWS NO OTHER SIGNS
OF DRUG OR ALCOHOL ABUSE.

04:54.662 --> 04:56.764
NOW ALL WE'VE GOTTA DO IS FIGURE
OUT WHICH ONE IS BIMBO

04:56.797 --> 04:58.766
AND WHICH ONE IS BITE-SIZE.

04:58.799 --> 05:02.670
ALSO, WHICH MONSTER TRUCK
WON THE 2004 THUNDER NATIONALS?

05:04.004 --> 05:05.639
HEP C MAKES SENSE.

05:05.673 --> 05:06.707
TEST CAME BACK NEGATIVE.
SAME FOR HEP A AND B.

05:06.740 --> 05:09.977
THE ANSWER WE WERE LOOKING FOR
IS VIRGINIA GIANT.

05:10.010 --> 05:12.680
FEEL FREE TO CHIME IN
ON EITHER CONVERSATION.

05:14.948 --> 05:17.451
HATE TO STEAL THE SPOTLIGHT
FROM SMALL WONDER OVER HERE,

05:17.485 --> 05:19.487
BUT WHAT ABOUT
TOXIC EXPOSURE?

05:19.520 --> 05:20.421
TETRACHLOROETHYLENE.

05:20.454 --> 05:22.823
COULD EVEN BE PENNYROYAL
OR SASSAFRAS OIL.

05:22.856 --> 05:25.759
GO TO HIS HOUSE,
GET ME SOME CHEMICALS.

05:27.160 --> 05:29.663
YOU WANNA STAY
ON THIS TEAM,

05:29.697 --> 05:30.664
HAVE AN OPINION.

05:37.805 --> 05:39.807
[car driving]

05:39.840 --> 05:40.541
(Masters)
OH, COOL!

05:40.574 --> 05:42.376
TUDOR REVIVAL
ARCHITECTURE.

05:42.410 --> 05:44.077
STEEPLY PITCHED,
ASYMMETRICAL ROOF

05:44.111 --> 05:45.913
OVER THE ENTRANCE.

05:45.946 --> 05:47.981
BUT IT DOESN'T HAVE
THE HALF TIMBERING

05:48.015 --> 05:49.417
OVER THE FACADE.

05:49.450 --> 05:50.818
DOESN'T SAY ANYTHING
ABOUT MEDICINE,

05:50.851 --> 05:51.985
CAN'T SHUT UP
ABOUT ARCHITECTURE.

05:52.019 --> 05:53.120
GREAT.
I KNOW.

05:53.153 --> 05:54.588
I DON'T KNOW
WHAT HAPPENED.

05:54.622 --> 05:55.823
BEING AROUND HOUSE...

05:55.856 --> 05:59.660
HE'S SUCH A LEGEND,
HE'S SO INTIMIDATING.

05:59.693 --> 06:01.495
I'M NOT LIKE THAT
AROUND ORDINARY PEOPLE.

06:01.529 --> 06:02.996
[chuckling softly]

06:03.030 --> 06:05.999
UH, NOT THAT YOU GUYS
ARE ORDINARY.

06:06.033 --> 06:07.635
IT'S JUST THAT
HE'S SO BRILLIANT

06:07.668 --> 06:09.503
AND YOU WORK UNDER HIM,
SO YOU'RE NOT AS IMPOSING.

06:09.537 --> 06:10.871
UM...

06:10.904 --> 06:12.573
I'M GONNA BE QUIET.

06:12.606 --> 06:13.607
GOOD IDEA.

06:15.876 --> 06:17.711
DUGAN DIDN'T
GIVE YOU A KEY?

06:17.745 --> 06:18.812
IF PATIENTS KNOW
WE'RE COMING,

06:18.846 --> 06:20.581
THEY CAN HIDE SOMETHING
RELEVANT TO THEIR ILLNESS

06:20.614 --> 06:21.582
INTENTIONALLY

06:21.615 --> 06:22.883
OR UNINTENTIONALLY.

06:22.916 --> 06:24.918
THEIR KNOWLEDGE
CHANGES THINGS.

06:37.665 --> 06:39.900
ARE YOU A VAMPIRE?

06:39.933 --> 06:41.735
IT'S OKAY.
WE'RE INVITING YOU IN.

06:41.769 --> 06:43.070
BUT OUR PATIENT DIDN'T.

06:44.237 --> 06:45.839
I CAN'T DO THIS,
I'M SORRY.

06:52.245 --> 06:54.582
(Taub)
WELL, SHE'S GONNA BE
A BIG HELP.

06:54.615 --> 06:55.683
(Foreman)
YEAH, WHAT A RUBE

06:55.716 --> 06:57.918
BEING UNCOMFORTABLE BREAKING
INTO A STRANGER'S HOUSE.

06:57.951 --> 06:59.119
PART OF OUR JOB DESCRIPTION,

06:59.152 --> 07:00.721
NOT THE MOST MORALLY
AMBIGUOUS PART.

07:00.754 --> 07:02.490
(Foreman)
GIVE HER A CHANCE.

07:02.523 --> 07:04.157
SHE'S FRESH,
ENTHUSIASTIC,

07:04.191 --> 07:05.859
HAS NO BAD HABITS
WE NEED TO RETEACH.

07:05.893 --> 07:08.896
SHE'S A MED STUDENT
WITH NO PRACTICAL EXPERIENCE.

07:08.929 --> 07:10.998
THAT MEANS EVERY PROCEDURE,
EVERY BLOOD DRAW,

07:11.031 --> 07:13.000
SHE NEEDS ONE OF US THERE
TO SUPERVISE.

07:13.033 --> 07:14.535
IS THIS ATTITUDE ABOUT HER

07:14.568 --> 07:15.836
NOT HAVING AN M.D.
AFTER HER NAME?

07:15.869 --> 07:17.204
BECAUSE I WONDER
IF IT HAS MORE TO DO

07:17.237 --> 07:18.205
WITH HER BEING A BRAINIAC.

07:18.238 --> 07:19.540
THAT'S NOT IT AT ALL.

07:19.573 --> 07:20.708
I'M NOT THRILLED
SOMEONE ELSE

07:20.741 --> 07:22.476
MIGHT BE THE SMARTEST PERSON
ON THE TEAM NOW.

07:22.510 --> 07:23.677
I CAN ONLY IMAGINE
HOW YOU FEEL.

07:23.711 --> 07:25.979
YOU'RE NOT SMARTER
THAN ME.

07:26.013 --> 07:26.980
OH, YEAH?

07:27.014 --> 07:29.517
YOU FIND THIS?

07:29.550 --> 07:31.652
(Foreman)
A JUG OF UNPASTEURIZED CIDER.

07:31.685 --> 07:33.120
IT COULD BE TAINTED
WITH E COLI,

07:33.153 --> 07:34.922
AND THAT'S WHAT'S CAUSING
THE LIVER TO SHUT DOWN.

07:34.955 --> 07:36.724
E COLI IS FOUND
IN ANIMALS.

07:36.757 --> 07:39.192
SO UNLESS HE'S DRINKING
PORK CIDER...

07:39.226 --> 07:41.094
PORK CIDER!

07:41.128 --> 07:42.630
I NEED THE NUMBER
OF THE PATENT OFFICE.

07:42.663 --> 07:44.732
THERE ARE INDIRECT WAYS
OF ATTRACTING E COLI.

07:44.765 --> 07:46.934
MASTERS REFUSED
TO GO ON THE SEARCH WITH US.

07:46.967 --> 07:48.168
INTERESTING.

07:48.201 --> 07:49.637
WHICH RAISES THE QUESTION,

07:49.670 --> 07:51.038
WHAT IS YOUR PROBLEM
WITH HER?

07:51.071 --> 07:53.240
HE IS INTIMIDATED
BY HER INTELLIGENCE.

07:53.273 --> 07:54.508
(House)
WHY WOULD THAT BOTHER TAUB?

07:54.542 --> 07:55.442
HE'S BEEN WORKING

07:55.475 --> 07:57.177
WITH PEOPLE SMARTER THAN HIM
FOR A LONG TIME.

07:57.210 --> 07:58.679
I THINK PERKY NEW GIRL

07:58.712 --> 08:00.848
MAKES HIM FEEL OLD.

08:00.881 --> 08:02.783
SHE'S BASICALLY THE SAME AGE
AS THIRTEEN.

08:02.816 --> 08:04.084
YEAH, BUT SHE'S A STUDENT.

08:04.117 --> 08:06.086
MAKES YOU CONTEMPLATE
YOUR MED SCHOOL DAYS.

08:06.119 --> 08:07.788
BACK WHEN YOU HAD HAIR,
MUSCLE TONE,

08:07.821 --> 08:09.790
AND NO NEED
FOR A REGULAR PROSTATE EXAM.

08:09.823 --> 08:10.924
MAKES SENSE.

08:10.958 --> 08:12.693
JUST LIKE E COLI.

08:12.726 --> 08:14.294
ORCHARDS MAKE CIDER
OUT OF APPLES

08:14.327 --> 08:15.629
THEY CAN'T SELL OTHERWISE,

08:15.663 --> 08:16.930
LIKE IF THEY'VE FALLEN
ONTO THE GROUND.

08:16.964 --> 08:19.266
LIKE, INTO SOME COW FECES.

08:19.299 --> 08:21.902
WHICH WOULD MEAN
OUR ESTEEMED PATIENT

08:21.935 --> 08:24.938
IS LITERALLY
FULL OF B.S.

08:24.972 --> 08:26.306
COOL.

08:26.339 --> 08:28.108
GO GET THE INGENUE,

08:28.141 --> 08:30.944
START THE PATIENT ON AZTREONAM
AND PLASMAPHERESIS.

08:32.846 --> 08:35.749
[loudly]
HE SAID TO START
THE PATIENT ON AZTRE--

08:35.783 --> 08:38.085
[chuckling]

08:38.118 --> 08:39.753
THE CELL SORTER
SEPARATES THE PLASMA

08:39.787 --> 08:41.321
FROM THE REMAINING
CELLULAR COMPONENTS,

08:41.354 --> 08:42.155
THEREBY REMOVING--

08:42.189 --> 08:45.125
THE TOXINS,
ANTIBODIES, CRYOGLOBULINS.

08:45.158 --> 08:46.594
I THINK WE SHOULD
TELL OUR PATIENT

08:46.627 --> 08:47.828
ABOUT BREAKING INTO HIS HOUSE.

08:47.861 --> 08:48.996
WHY WOULD WE DO THAT?

08:49.029 --> 08:50.764
BECAUSE THE REASON
NOT TO TELL HIM

08:50.798 --> 08:52.666
WAS THAT HE MIGHT
HIDE SOMETHING.

08:52.700 --> 08:54.134
AND NOW THAT RATIONALE
IS MOOT.

08:54.167 --> 08:55.569
THE RATIONALE NOW

08:55.603 --> 08:57.705
IS NO UPSIDE,
BIG DOWNSIDE.

08:57.738 --> 09:00.107
HOW CAN WE ASK OUR PATIENTS
TO TRUST US

09:00.140 --> 09:01.709
IF WE'RE NOT
HONEST WITH THEM?

09:01.742 --> 09:03.076
HOW CAN WE ASK THE PATIENT
TO TRUST US

09:03.110 --> 09:04.878
AFTER WE TELL HIM
HE CAN'T TRUST US?

09:05.979 --> 09:07.748
FINE.

09:07.781 --> 09:08.749
TELL HIM.

09:08.782 --> 09:09.983
CLEAR YOUR CONSCIENCE,

09:10.017 --> 09:12.085
BECAUSE THAT'S
WHAT'S IMPORTANT.

09:14.755 --> 09:16.256
(Dugan)
WELL, IF YOU WOULD LET ME
RUN THAT AD,

09:16.289 --> 09:19.126
EVERYBODY WOULD BE TALKING
ABOUT IMMIGRATION INSTEAD.

09:19.159 --> 09:20.761
ALL RIGHT, LOOK,
HERE'S WHAT WE'RE GONNA SAY.

09:20.794 --> 09:22.062
YEAH, HE WAS IN IRAQ,

09:22.095 --> 09:23.931
AND WE'RE ALL GRATEFUL
FOR HIS SACRIFICE.

09:23.964 --> 09:26.266
YOU CHOSE TO HONOR YOUR COUNTRY
THROUGH PUBLIC SERVICE

09:26.299 --> 09:29.703
AND HAVE VOTED 46 TIMES
TO EXPAND THE PENTAGON'S BUDGET

09:29.737 --> 09:32.673
FOR PROGRAMS WHICH, OH, BY THE
WAY, MORENO WANTS TO CUT.

09:32.706 --> 09:35.676
ALL RIGHT. I'LL DRAFT IT UP,
SEND IT OVER.

09:35.709 --> 09:36.844
[phone beeps]

09:36.877 --> 09:37.911
(Masters)
YOU SHOULD PROBABLY SLOW DOWN

09:37.945 --> 09:39.747
UNTIL YOU'RE
OUT OF THE HOSPITAL.

09:39.780 --> 09:42.282
IT'S A BUSY WEEK.

09:48.088 --> 09:50.658
AREN'T YOU CURIOUS HOW WE
CAME UP WITH THIS DIAGNOSIS?

09:50.691 --> 09:52.960
YOU'RE DOCTORS.
ISN'T THAT YOUR JOB?

09:52.993 --> 09:54.662
BUT HOW WE KNEW
YOU WERE DRINKING APPLE CIDER?

09:54.695 --> 09:56.263
WELL, YOU HAD TO HAVE
FOUND THAT AT MY HOUSE,

09:56.296 --> 09:57.831
SO I GUESS YOU GUYS
BROKE IN THERE.

10:01.902 --> 10:03.070
THAT DOESN'T BOTHER YOU?

10:03.103 --> 10:04.838
MEDICINE'S LIKE POLITICS.

10:04.872 --> 10:06.674
AT THE END OF THE DAY,
ALL THAT MATTERS IS RESULTS.

10:06.707 --> 10:07.675
THAT'S NOT TRUE.

10:07.708 --> 10:09.910
RESPECT MATTERS.

10:09.943 --> 10:10.911
HONESTY

10:10.944 --> 10:12.079
AND INTEGRITY MATTER.

10:12.112 --> 10:14.281
HAVE YOU EVER THOUGHT ABOUT
RUNNING FOR PUBLIC OFFICE?

10:14.314 --> 10:17.284
BECAUSE I WOULD LOVE TO HAVE
SOMEONE LIKE YOU

10:17.317 --> 10:18.351
AS AN OPPONENT.

10:20.387 --> 10:22.089
WATCH THE REPLACEMENT
FLUID LINE.

10:22.122 --> 10:23.724
OH, RIGHT, SORRY.

10:23.757 --> 10:25.726
(Masters)
YOU EVER WONDER WHY
AMERICAN VOTER

10:25.759 --> 10:27.661
TURNOUT RATES
ARE AMONG THE LOWEST

10:27.695 --> 10:29.229
IN THE DEVELOPED WORLD?

10:32.800 --> 10:33.801
MR. DUGAN?

10:35.168 --> 10:37.838
MR. DUGAN?

10:37.871 --> 10:39.873
WHAT'S WRONG?
CAN YOU HEAR ME?

10:41.775 --> 10:42.743
HE'S PARALYZED.

10:42.776 --> 10:44.678
CALL FOREMAN AND CHASE,
GET THEM DOWN HERE.

10:44.712 --> 10:45.679
[beeping]

10:45.713 --> 10:46.680
MR. DUGAN!

10:46.714 --> 10:47.815
[beeping]

10:51.852 --> 10:53.020
(Chase)
WE THINKS IT'S A TRANSIENT
ISCHEMIC ATTACK.

10:53.053 --> 10:54.021
THE CLOT MUST HAVE BROKEN UP

10:54.054 --> 10:55.055
BEFORE WE COULD FIND IT.

10:55.088 --> 10:56.990
HE WAS TEMPORARILY PARALYZED,

10:57.024 --> 10:58.025
BUT HE'S REGAINING
MOBILITY AND SPEECH.

10:58.058 --> 10:59.026
(House)
SO, WHAT CAUSES RASH,

10:59.059 --> 11:01.361
LIVER FAILURE, CLOTS,

11:01.394 --> 11:03.096
AND THE UNCONTROLLABLE URGE

11:03.130 --> 11:05.098
TO RAT OUT YOUR COWORKERS?

11:05.132 --> 11:05.966
OH, NO, WAIT--

11:05.999 --> 11:08.869
THAT LAST ONE WAS YOU,
NOT THE PATIENT.

11:08.902 --> 11:11.038
I WASN'T TRYING TO RAT.

11:11.071 --> 11:13.206
I WAS CLEARLY TRYING TO HONOR
MY ETHICAL OBLIGATION.

11:13.240 --> 11:16.176
PORTAL VEIN THROMBOSIS

11:16.209 --> 11:18.145
COULD BE CAUSED
BY WILSON'S DISEASE.

11:18.178 --> 11:22.149
HOORAY!

11:22.182 --> 11:23.250
YOU POPPED YOUR CHERRY,

11:23.283 --> 11:25.052
DIAGNOSTICALLY SPEAKING.

11:25.085 --> 11:27.420
UNFORTUNATELY,
THE FIRST TIME ALWAYS SUCKS.

11:27.454 --> 11:29.122
PITCH DOESN'T MAKE
ANY SENSE.

11:29.156 --> 11:30.490
DUGAN'S CORNEA WAS NORMAL.

11:30.523 --> 11:32.259
YOU'RE OBVIOUSLY BRILLIANT.

11:32.292 --> 11:34.127
SO WHY WOULD YOU
HIDE YOUR MIND?

11:34.161 --> 11:35.362
I WAS BRAINSTORMING.

11:35.395 --> 11:37.965
I'M NOT TALKING ABOUT YOUR
STUPID IDEAS ABOUT THE PATIENT.

11:37.998 --> 11:39.366
I MEAN YOUR STUPID IDEAS
ABOUT MORALITY.

11:39.399 --> 11:41.902
MY STUPID IDEAS ARE WHAT
MOST DOCTORS CONSIDER

11:41.935 --> 11:45.172
THE RULES
FOR PROFESSIONAL CONDUCT.

11:45.205 --> 11:47.107
WHAT ABOUT
A NEUROENDOCRINE TUMOR?

11:47.140 --> 11:48.809
NOT WITHOUT
DIMINISHED MENTAL CAPACITY,

11:48.842 --> 11:50.143
LOSS OF JUDGMENT.

11:50.177 --> 11:52.913
(Taub)
DISSEMINATED INTRAVASCULAR
COAGULATION,

11:52.946 --> 11:55.048
HOWEVER, FITS.

11:55.082 --> 11:57.050
RULES ARE JUST HELPFUL
GUIDELINES FOR STUPID PEOPLE

11:57.084 --> 11:59.086
WHO CAN'T MAKE UP
THEIR OWN MIND.

11:59.119 --> 12:00.087
YOU OBVIOUSLY DON'T FIT
INTO THAT CATEGORY,

12:00.120 --> 12:02.089
SO WHY PUT YOURSELF THERE?

12:02.122 --> 12:03.090
MASTERS IS RIGHT

12:03.123 --> 12:05.025
ABOUT A NEUROENDOCRINE TUMOR.

12:05.058 --> 12:07.895
BECAUSE YES, DUGAN HAS HAD

12:07.928 --> 12:08.896
A LOSS OF JUDGMENT.

12:08.929 --> 12:09.963
HE MADE THIS TOTALLY
INFLAMMATORY

12:09.997 --> 12:12.232
ANTI-IMMIGRATION CAMPAIGN
COMMERCIAL FOR ANDERSON.

12:12.265 --> 12:14.835
IT JUST GOT LINKED ONLINE.

12:14.868 --> 12:17.104
(Foreman)
YOU'RE ARGUING DUGAN'S POLITICS

12:17.137 --> 12:18.105
ARE A SIGN THAT
HE'S MENTALLY COMPROMISED?

12:18.138 --> 12:19.506
NO, HIS TACTICS.

12:19.539 --> 12:20.874
(Chase)
HE'S MOST LIKELY
THE ONE WHO LEAKED IT

12:20.908 --> 12:22.009
AND ALL THE COMMENTATORS
ARE SAYING

12:22.042 --> 12:23.811
ANDERSON WILL CATCH
A MAJOR BACKLASH.

12:23.844 --> 12:25.112
AND HONESTY'S A GREAT IDEA

12:25.145 --> 12:26.079
UNTIL YOUR PATIENT ASKS

12:26.113 --> 12:28.415
IF HER DISTENDED ABDOMEN
MAKES HER LOOKS FAT.

12:28.448 --> 12:30.117
(Foreman)
HOUSE, I HATE TO INTERRUPT
YOUR ETHICS DEBATE,

12:30.150 --> 12:33.921
BUT WE HAVE TWO SOLID IDEAS
ON THE TABLE.

12:33.954 --> 12:35.122
[sighs]

12:35.155 --> 12:38.391
CT FROM HIS NECK TO HIS ABDOMEN
FOR NEUROENDOCRINE TUMORS.

12:38.425 --> 12:40.093
RUN A D-DIMER

12:40.127 --> 12:41.995
AND FIBRINOGEN
FOR D.I.C.

12:46.366 --> 12:49.069
(House)
MASTERS.

12:49.102 --> 12:51.471
IF LYING TO A PATIENT
SAVED THEIR LIFE,

12:51.504 --> 12:52.472
WOULD YOU DO IT?

12:52.505 --> 12:54.174
NO.

12:54.207 --> 12:55.175
THAT'S A LIE.

12:55.208 --> 12:58.345
IF YOUR GRANDMA GAVE YOU
A REALLY CRAPPY TEA COZY

12:58.378 --> 13:00.313
FOR CHRISTMAS, WOULD YOU
TELL HER YOU LIKED IT?

13:00.347 --> 13:02.582
YES, BUT THAT'S DIFFERENT.

13:02.615 --> 13:04.084
SO, YOU LIE
WHEN IT DOESN'T MATTER

13:04.117 --> 13:05.152
BUT YOU WON'T
WHEN IT DOES.

13:05.185 --> 13:07.087
HOW'D YOU GET
SO SCREWED UP?

13:12.525 --> 13:13.961
(House)
HOW MAD WOULD YOU BE

13:13.994 --> 13:15.195
IF I FIRED MASTERS?

13:15.228 --> 13:17.330
VERY.

13:17.364 --> 13:19.366
UNLESS YOU HAD CAUSE.

13:19.399 --> 13:21.234
REAL CAUSE.

13:21.268 --> 13:23.336
CAUSE THAT A HUMAN BEING
WOULD CONSIDER CAUSE.

13:23.370 --> 13:25.138
NEVER MIND, THEN.

13:25.172 --> 13:26.874
SHE'S GOT PRINCIPALS.

13:26.907 --> 13:30.210
SHE'S LIKE THE LOVE CHILD
OF EINSTEIN AND MARY POPPINS.

13:30.243 --> 13:32.312
DIDN'T EVEN GET
EINSTEIN'S HAIR.

13:32.345 --> 13:34.447
IT'S WORTH HAVING
SOMEONE ON THE TEAM

13:34.481 --> 13:37.017
WHO DOESN'T SEE THE WORLD
ENTIRELY AS SHADES OF GRAY.

13:37.050 --> 13:38.886
IT IS GRAY!
TO YOU.

13:38.919 --> 13:42.022
[elevator dings]
SHE HAS A FRESH PERSPECTIVE.

13:42.055 --> 13:43.523
UNLESS THAT THREATENS YOU.

13:43.556 --> 13:46.159
IT DOES NOT--

13:46.193 --> 13:48.161
YOU THOUGHT
I'D GET DEFENSIVE,

13:48.195 --> 13:50.197
KEEP HER
OUT OF PRIDE.

13:50.230 --> 13:52.966
A GIRL CAN HOPE.

13:53.000 --> 13:56.303
HOUSE, I GAVE THIS
A LOT OF THOUGHT.

13:56.336 --> 13:58.872
SHE DESERVES
A CHANCE.

13:58.906 --> 14:00.140
A REAL CHANCE.

14:07.314 --> 14:09.249
HOUSE IS GONNA FIRE ME.

14:09.282 --> 14:10.984
NO, HE ISN'T.

14:11.018 --> 14:12.419
BECAUSE YOU TOLD HIM
NOT TO?

14:12.452 --> 14:15.355
BUTTING HEADS WITH HOUSE
IS PAR FOR THE COURSE.

14:15.388 --> 14:17.124
HOUSE HAS STRONG BELIEFS,

14:17.157 --> 14:20.093
AND HE RESPECTS OTHER PEOPLE
WITH STRONG BELIEFS.

14:20.127 --> 14:22.662
IT'S NOT MY BELIEFS
THAT ARE THE PROBLEM.

14:22.695 --> 14:23.563
IT'S MY PERSONALITY.

14:23.596 --> 14:26.366
I'M NOT GOOD AT WORKING
WITH OTHER PEOPLE.

14:26.399 --> 14:29.102
YOU'VE BEEN IN THERE
FOR LESS THAN A DAY.

14:29.136 --> 14:30.470
I WASN'T LOOKING
FOR ENCOURAGEMENT.

14:30.503 --> 14:33.273
IT'S A FACT.

14:33.306 --> 14:35.175
GROWING UP,
MY WHOLE LIFE, REALLY,

14:35.208 --> 14:37.277
I-I SPENT
A LOT OF TIME BY MYSELF.

14:37.310 --> 14:39.079
AND NO ONE IN HIGH SCHOOL
WANTS TO HANG OUT

14:39.112 --> 14:41.648
WITH A KID THAT'S
THREE YEARS YOUNGER THAN THEM.

14:41.681 --> 14:44.351
AND STUDYING ANOSOV
DIFFEOMORPHISMS,

14:44.384 --> 14:46.619
DETERMINING WHETHER
AN UNATTRIBUTED LANDSCAPE

14:46.653 --> 14:50.290
IS A BLAKELOCK
OR A RYDER OR...

14:50.323 --> 14:52.192
I'M ACTUALLY
BORING YOU RIGHT NOW.

14:52.225 --> 14:55.062
AND YET
YOU CHOSE MEDICINE

14:55.095 --> 14:57.530
WHICH IS
A TEAM ACTIVITY.

14:57.564 --> 14:58.498
IT'S PRETTY GUTSY,

14:58.531 --> 15:00.467
STEPPING SO FAR OUTSIDE
YOUR COMFORT ZONE.

15:00.500 --> 15:05.105
I'M NOT TRYING
TO PROVE ANYTHING.

15:05.138 --> 15:07.340
I JUST WANTED
TO BE A DOCTOR.

15:07.374 --> 15:09.376
IT WAS STUPID.

15:09.409 --> 15:13.046
NOBODY CAN DO EVERYTHING.

15:13.080 --> 15:18.285
I WAS VAIN TO THINK
I COULD BE THE EXCEPTION.

15:18.318 --> 15:20.253
HOUSE DOESN'T CARE
IF YOU'RE A TEAM PLAYER,

15:20.287 --> 15:22.122
OR HOW ETHICAL YOU ARE,

15:22.155 --> 15:24.191
OR HOW HIGH YOUR I.Q. IS.

15:24.224 --> 15:26.526
IT'S ALL ABOUT THE CASES.

15:26.559 --> 15:29.162
YOU HELP HIM
CRACK THIS ONE,

15:29.196 --> 15:30.663
YOU TWO ARE GONNA
GET ALONG JUST FINE.

15:33.433 --> 15:35.268
(Foreman)
WE GOTTA GIVE MASTERS
SOME POINTERS,

15:35.302 --> 15:37.370
HELP HER FIGURE OUT
HOW TO DEAL WITH HOUSE.

15:37.404 --> 15:39.139
WHY WOULD I DO THAT?

15:39.172 --> 15:42.242
THE ENTERTAINMENT FACTOR
IS OFF THE CHARTS.

15:42.275 --> 15:44.577
IT'S LIKE WATCHING
A BUNNY HOP INTO A BUZZ SAW.

15:44.611 --> 15:46.146
REPEATEDLY.

15:46.179 --> 15:48.215
AND IF WE DON'T HELP HER,
SHE'S OUT OF HERE.

15:48.248 --> 15:51.584
NO, SOMETHING ELSE IS STOPPING
HOUSE FROM FIRING HER.

15:51.618 --> 15:54.287
I'M GUESSING IT'S HIS DESIRE
TO KEEP HAVING SEX WITH CUDDY.

15:54.321 --> 15:58.725
(Dugan)
YOU GUYS READY TO ADMIT
YOU WERE WRONG YET?

15:58.758 --> 16:00.560
EXCUSE ME?

16:00.593 --> 16:03.563
THIS TUMOR YOU'RE LOOKING FOR--
YOU'RE NOT GONNA FIND IT.

16:03.596 --> 16:08.135
MY JUDGMENT
IS COMPLETELY SOUND.

16:08.168 --> 16:09.702
SO WHEN YOU
LEAKED THAT AD,

16:09.736 --> 16:13.006
YOU WERE TRYING TO TORPEDO
THE SENATOR'S CAMPAIGN?

16:13.040 --> 16:15.008
ALL RIGHT, ONE,
I TOLD YOU BEFORE,

16:15.042 --> 16:16.109
I DIDN'T LEAK THAT SPOT.

16:16.143 --> 16:18.045
UH-HUH.

16:18.078 --> 16:19.046
AND TWO...

16:19.079 --> 16:20.580
WHOEVER DID LEAK THAT AD

16:20.613 --> 16:22.249
HAD NOTHING WRONG
WITH THEIR MIND EITHER.

16:22.282 --> 16:23.250
IT'S GONNA SAVE ANDERSON.

16:23.283 --> 16:25.052
(Chase)
THAT COMMERCIAL...

16:25.085 --> 16:27.254
EVERYONE SEES THROUGH IT.

16:27.287 --> 16:29.089
YOU'RE JUST TRYING TO PLAY
TO PEOPLE'S FEARS.

16:29.122 --> 16:29.956
YOU SAY FEARS.

16:29.989 --> 16:33.293
I SAY RATIONAL,
PROTECTIVE INSTINCTS.

16:33.326 --> 16:35.362
AND JUDGING BY YOUR ACCENT,

16:35.395 --> 16:37.164
IMMIGRATION PROBABLY
ISN'T AN ISSUE

16:37.197 --> 16:39.132
YOU CAN BE
REAL IMPARTIAL ABOUT.

16:39.166 --> 16:41.768
I WAITED FIVE YEARS
TO GET MY GREEN CARD.

16:41.801 --> 16:43.236
IF THERE'S ANYONE
WHO WOULD RESENT

16:43.270 --> 16:45.238
SOMEONE TRYING TO SKIP
THE QUEUE, IT'D BE ME.

16:45.272 --> 16:47.174
JUST BECAUSE MORENO
FAVORS AMNESTY--

16:47.207 --> 16:49.309
HE DOESN'T.

16:49.342 --> 16:51.111
YOU KNOW THAT PICTURE OF HIM
WITH THE MEXICAN FLAGS

16:51.144 --> 16:54.214
THAT SEEMS TO BE
FROM A PRO-AMNESTY RALLY?

16:54.247 --> 16:56.216
THAT'S FROM AN AMNESTY
INTERNATIONAL SPEECH

16:56.249 --> 17:00.253
PROTESTING THE IMPRISONMENT
OF PRIESTS IN OAXACA.

17:00.287 --> 17:02.489
YES, YOU DID JUST PROVE
THAT THAT AD

17:02.522 --> 17:04.457
IS EVEN MORE DISGUSTING
THAN YOU THOUGHT.

17:04.491 --> 17:09.129
YOU ALSO PROVED
THAT AD IS EFFECTIVE.

17:09.162 --> 17:11.264
YOU STILL THINK
MY JUDGMENT IS OFF?

17:11.298 --> 17:13.266
NOT ANYMORE.

17:13.300 --> 17:15.202
THERE'S NO SIGN
OF A TUMOR.

17:15.235 --> 17:17.237
THAT LEAVES D.I.C.

17:17.270 --> 17:19.306
I'LL GO CHECK HOW TAUB IS DOING
WITH THE BLOOD WORK.

17:25.278 --> 17:26.746
I GUESS WHEN YOU
GET ON IN YEARS,

17:26.779 --> 17:29.282
IT TAKES A LITTLE LONGER TO RUN
A FEW SIMPLE BLOOD TESTS.

17:29.316 --> 17:31.218
THIS WHOLE "TAUB'S
AN OLD MAN" THING

17:31.251 --> 17:32.752
KINDA RINGS HOLLOW,

17:32.785 --> 17:34.654
CONSIDERING I'M IN BETTER SHAPE
THAN YOU ARE.

17:34.687 --> 17:35.655
PASS THE DYE.

17:35.688 --> 17:38.225
YOU'RE IN ROUNDER SHAPE
THAN ME.

17:38.258 --> 17:39.359
TONIGHT AFTER WORK,

17:39.392 --> 17:40.827
MEET AT THE BASKETBALL COURTS
IN THE GYM.

17:40.860 --> 17:43.496
YOU DO REALIZE YOU'RE
TWO AND A HALF FEET TALL, RIGHT?

17:43.530 --> 17:45.698
AND WHITE.
AND JEWISH.

17:45.732 --> 17:47.200
IT'D BE VERY EMBARRASSING.

17:47.234 --> 17:48.501
I GET WHY
YOU WANNA SAY NO.

17:48.535 --> 17:50.137
TONIGHT AFTER WORK.

17:50.170 --> 17:52.405
[beeping]
CRAP.

17:56.676 --> 17:58.145
(Anderson)
DID YOU HEAR MORENO'S
LATEST STUMP SPEECH?

17:58.178 --> 18:00.280
HE'S GONNA
CLEAN UP WASHINGTON.

18:00.313 --> 18:01.614
[scoffs]
YEAH, RIGHT.

18:01.648 --> 18:03.650
LIKE ANY POLITICIAN
FROM NEW JERSEY

18:03.683 --> 18:04.517
HAS EVER CLEANED UP--

18:04.551 --> 18:07.154
WHO ELSE KNOWS
THAT YOU LEAKED THAT AD?

18:07.187 --> 18:10.257
YOU AND I HAD
THE ONLY TWO COPIES, HAL.

18:10.290 --> 18:11.057
I DON'T CARE
THAT YOU DID IT.

18:11.090 --> 18:13.760
I JUST WANT TO
MAKE SURE IT WORKED.

18:13.793 --> 18:18.265
THIS MORNING'S TRACKING
HAS ME WITHIN TWO POINTS.

18:18.298 --> 18:19.466
TOLD YOU.

18:19.499 --> 18:22.469
WE'RE GONNA
PULL THIS THING OFF.

18:22.502 --> 18:24.771
YOUR BLOOD TEST FOR D.I.C.
CAME BACK COMPLETELY NORMAL.

18:24.804 --> 18:26.105
THAT'S GOOD NEWS,
RIGHT?

18:26.139 --> 18:27.474
(Taub)
THAT MEANS THE TWO THINGS
WE THOUGHT IT COULD BE,

18:27.507 --> 18:28.808
IT'S NOT.

18:28.841 --> 18:30.777
WE CHECKED YOUR HOME
FOR TOXINS AND DIDN'T FIND ANY.

18:30.810 --> 18:33.180
BUT IT'S POSSIBLE YOU MIGHT'VE
BEEN EXPOSED ON THE CAMPAIGN.

18:33.213 --> 18:36.449
(Foreman)
HAVE YOU VISITED ANY INDUSTRIAL
OR AGRICULTURAL FACILITIES?

18:36.483 --> 18:38.318
THERE WAS A TOMATO FARM
IN LUMBERTON.

18:38.351 --> 18:40.187
THEY TAKE YOU
INTO THE FIELDS?

18:40.220 --> 18:41.788
NO ONE WANTS A PHOTO OP WITH ME.
I NEVER LEAVE THE BUS.

18:41.821 --> 18:43.823
WERE THE WINDOWS OPEN?
CERTAIN PESTICIDES--

18:43.856 --> 18:44.857
FOREMAN.

18:48.928 --> 18:49.896
WHAT?
WHAT IS IT?

18:49.929 --> 18:52.332
IT'S NOT JUST YOUR LIVER
WE HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT.

18:52.365 --> 18:54.734
LOOKS LIKE YOUR KIDNEYS
ARE HAVING PROBLEMS, TOO.

19:00.807 --> 19:03.276
SO THIS GUY SPENDS
HIS ENTIRE LIFE

19:03.310 --> 19:05.245
CAMPAIGNING AGAINST
BLEEDING HEARTS.

19:05.278 --> 19:08.215
AND IT TURNS OUT
HE HAS ONE.

19:08.248 --> 19:09.649
BLOODY URINE ACTUALLY
IS A RENAL PROBLEM,

19:09.682 --> 19:10.917
NOT A CARDIAC ONE.

19:10.950 --> 19:12.585
YEAH, IF I SAY
SOMETHING INACCURATE,

19:12.619 --> 19:13.653
ASSUME IT'S
FOR COMIC EFFECT.

19:13.686 --> 19:15.955
THEN LAUGH,
BECAUSE IT'S FUNNY.

19:15.988 --> 19:17.857
TTP MAKES SENSE.

19:17.890 --> 19:18.858
WHAT'RE HIS PLATELETS?

19:18.891 --> 19:20.727
200,000.
IT'S NOT TTP.

19:20.760 --> 19:22.462
WHAT ABOUT HENOCH-SCHOENLEIN
PURPURA ?

19:22.495 --> 19:23.696
H.S.P. DOESN'T CAUSE CLOTS.

19:23.730 --> 19:25.332
H.S.P. DOESN'T
USUALLY CAUSE CLOTS,

19:25.365 --> 19:26.399
BUT IT CAN.

19:26.433 --> 19:27.767
AND THE VASCULITIS

19:27.800 --> 19:28.868
WOULD EXPLAIN
THE KIDNEY PROBLEM.

19:28.901 --> 19:30.403
(House)
SHE CAN'T DIAGNOSE A JOKE,

19:30.437 --> 19:31.771
BUT SHE'S MAKING PROGRESS
ON THE PATIENT.

19:34.374 --> 19:36.643
WE TREAT WITH CHEMOTHERAPY
OR STEROIDS.

19:36.676 --> 19:38.378
WE TREAT
WITH CHEMOTHERAPY.

19:38.411 --> 19:39.646
I SAID CHEMO.

19:39.679 --> 19:41.248
THEN YOU SAID, "OR."

19:41.281 --> 19:42.549
ONCE AGAIN,
THE BUNNY MEETS THE BLADE.

19:42.582 --> 19:43.850
(House)
THE ROAD TO DEAD PATIENTS

19:43.883 --> 19:45.618
IS PAVED WITH "OR"S.

19:45.652 --> 19:47.920
CHEMO IS THE MORE
EFFECTIVE TREATMENT

19:47.954 --> 19:50.423
WHICH MEANS IT'LL CONFIRM OUR
DIAGNOSIS MORE QUICKLY.

19:50.457 --> 19:51.858
I AGREE,
BUT THERE IS ANOTHER OPTION.

19:51.891 --> 19:52.892
THERE ARE LOTS
OF OTHER OPTIONS.

19:52.925 --> 19:53.893
THERE'S BLOODLETTING,

19:53.926 --> 19:55.628
CRYSTALS, PRAYER--

19:55.662 --> 19:57.297
ANOTHER MEDICALLY ACCEPTED
OPTION.

19:57.330 --> 19:59.599
WHICH IS BOTH LESS EFFECTIVE
AND LESS SCARY.

19:59.632 --> 20:01.234
SO THE PATIENT
MIGHT JUST CHOOSE IT.

20:01.268 --> 20:02.635
UNLESS, OF COURSE,
WE DON'T MENTION IT TO HIM.

20:02.669 --> 20:06.739
WE CAN'T WITHHOLD INFORMATION.

20:06.773 --> 20:08.675
IF WE EXPLAIN
BOTH THE BENEFITS

20:08.708 --> 20:09.742
AND THE RISKS
OF EACH TREATMENT

20:09.776 --> 20:10.877
I'M SURE DUGAN
WILL CHOOSE CHEMO.

20:10.910 --> 20:12.912
WELL, AS LONG AS YOU'RE SURE.

20:15.882 --> 20:17.750
THE BETTER OPTION
IS CHEMOTHERAPY.

20:17.784 --> 20:20.253
IT'S FASTER AND MORE LIKELY
TO COMPLETELY CURE YOU.

20:20.287 --> 20:21.754
I'LL TAKE
THE STEROIDS.

20:21.788 --> 20:23.656
OH, MY GOODNESS!

20:23.690 --> 20:25.625
IF ONLY SOMEONE
COULD'VE PREDICTED

20:25.658 --> 20:28.728
THAT YOU'D MAKE
THAT INCREDIBLY STUPID DECISION.

20:28.761 --> 20:31.764
THE NAUSEA AND FATIGUE
FROM CHEMO

20:31.798 --> 20:33.333
WILL ONLY LAST A FEW WEEKS.

20:33.366 --> 20:34.601
OUR POLL NUMBERS
HAVE STALLED.

20:34.634 --> 20:36.769
THAT'S FIVE DAYS
TILL THE ELECTION.

20:36.803 --> 20:37.904
DOCTOR, CAN YOU
TALK SOME SENSE INTO HIM?

20:37.937 --> 20:39.972
WOULD THAT I COULD,

20:40.006 --> 20:41.708
BUT ETHICS DICTATE
THAT IT'S HIS DECISION.

20:41.741 --> 20:43.776
SO ALL I CAN DO NOW
IS RETURN TO MY OFFICE

20:43.810 --> 20:46.879
KNOWING, EVEN AS MY PATIENT
ENDANGERS HIMSELF,

20:46.913 --> 20:51.318
MY INTEGRITY REMAINS
UNBLEMISHED.

20:51.351 --> 20:52.352
PLEASE.

20:52.385 --> 20:53.986
TAKE SOME TIME
TO THINK ABOUT THIS.

20:54.020 --> 20:56.323
I DON'T NEED ANY TIME.
I WANT TO START ON THE STEROIDS.

21:03.963 --> 21:06.366
GAME TO 11 BY ONES.

21:06.399 --> 21:07.500
UH, HOLD ON.

21:13.773 --> 21:14.741
WANNA SHOOT FOR OUTS?

21:14.774 --> 21:16.275
YOU CAN HAVE IT.

21:20.079 --> 21:21.814
[in feeble voice]
ONE, NOTHING.

21:21.848 --> 21:23.383
[White Denim's I Start To Run]

21:23.416 --> 21:25.051
YOU GONNA GUARD ME?

21:25.084 --> 21:26.886
CAN'T HIT
TWO IN A ROW.

21:26.919 --> 21:29.021
*

21:29.055 --> 21:30.390
TWO, NOTHING.

21:30.423 --> 21:31.824
YOU GONNA GUARD ME NOW?

21:31.858 --> 21:33.726
YOU CAN HAVE
THAT SHOT ALL DAY.

21:33.760 --> 21:34.827
* DAYTIME I WALK STREET

21:34.861 --> 21:36.529

* I'M WALKING STREET YEAH

21:38.631 --> 21:39.966

21:39.999 --> 21:41.100
* SOMEBODY'S LISTENING

21:41.133 --> 21:42.101
* I FEEL
LIKE SOMEONE'S LISTENING *

* TO THE SONG IN MY HEAD

21:44.837 --> 21:46.439
* I START TO RUN

21:46.473 --> 21:48.408

22:38.658 --> 22:41.027
(Taub)
SERIOUSLY?

22:41.060 --> 22:42.895
YOU'RE GONNA BEAT ME
WITH THAT?

22:42.929 --> 22:45.097
[panting]

22:45.131 --> 22:47.166
WELL--
[panting]

22:47.199 --> 22:48.701
I WAS WRONG.

22:48.735 --> 22:49.702
YOU'RE NOT SO OLD.

22:49.736 --> 22:51.538
THANK YOU.

22:51.571 --> 22:52.672
NOW ALL WE HAVE
TO DO IS FIGURE OUT

22:52.705 --> 22:56.543
WHY MASTERS IS MAKING YOU
FEEL INSECURE.

22:56.576 --> 22:58.578
[sighing]

23:02.982 --> 23:04.617
I WAS JUST DOWN
BY DUGAN'S ROOM.

23:04.651 --> 23:06.653
THEY WERE READY
TO GIVE HIM THE WRONG MEDICINE.

23:06.686 --> 23:08.821
I TRIED TO CHANGE THE ORDER,
BUT I'M NOT A DOCTOR.

23:08.855 --> 23:10.690
GOOD.

23:10.723 --> 23:12.792
THE WRONG MEDICINE
IS THE RIGHT MEDICINE.

23:12.825 --> 23:15.161
BUT HE WANTED STEROIDS,
NOT CHEMO.

23:15.194 --> 23:16.829
HE WANTS TO LIVE.

23:16.863 --> 23:19.031
I'M GONNA TELL HIM
WHAT'S GOING ON.

23:19.065 --> 23:21.534
NO, YOU'RE NOT.

23:21.568 --> 23:23.770
I DON'T MIND YOUR MORALITY
IN THEORY.

23:23.803 --> 23:26.172
BUT IN PRACTICE, YOU'RE RISKING
MY PATIENT'S LIFE.

23:26.205 --> 23:27.740
SO YOU'RE FIRED.

23:29.208 --> 23:31.511
YOU THINK THAT'S GONNA
STOP ME FROM TELLING HIM?

23:31.544 --> 23:33.680
IF YOU DO, I'LL GET YOU
THROWN OUT OF MEDICAL SCHOOL.

23:33.713 --> 23:36.048
I HAVEN'T DONE ANYTHING
THAT WOULD MERIT THAT.

23:36.082 --> 23:37.149
I KNOW.

23:37.183 --> 23:39.018
BUT UNLIKE YOU,
I'M WILLING TO LIE.

23:43.856 --> 23:45.024
(Foreman)
FIRING HER WAS A MISTAKE.

23:45.057 --> 23:46.025
WE NEED SOMEONE LIKE HER
ON THE TEAM,

23:46.058 --> 23:48.661
KEEPING US ALL IN CHECK.

23:48.695 --> 23:49.496
YOU'RE INCAPABLE OF NOTICING

23:49.529 --> 23:51.130
WHEN I DO SOMETHING
INAPPROPRIATE?

23:51.163 --> 23:52.899
WE'RE LIKE THE FROGS WHO'VE BEEN
IN THE POT FOR A WHILE.

23:52.932 --> 23:54.501
WE'RE USED TO THE HEAT.

23:54.534 --> 23:56.669
THINGS HAVE BEEN JUST FINE
WITHOUT PIPPI LONGDIVISION.

23:56.703 --> 23:57.670
(House)
YOUR OPPONENT'S
OUT OF THE RACE.

23:57.704 --> 24:00.072
YOU CAN DROP
THE SMEAR CAMPAIGN.

24:00.106 --> 24:01.674
(Chase)
DUGAN DEVELOPED
PULMONARY EDEMA.

24:01.708 --> 24:03.009
IT'S NOT H.S.P.

24:03.042 --> 24:04.677
(Foreman)
MASTERS WAS RIGHT.

24:04.711 --> 24:06.713
HE DIDN'T WANT THE CHEMO.
HE DIDN'T NEED THE CHEMO.

24:06.746 --> 24:08.114
MASTERS WAS WRONG.

24:08.147 --> 24:09.782
HE DOESN'T HAVE H.S.P.

24:09.816 --> 24:11.651
AND MASTERS IS GONE.

24:11.684 --> 24:12.519
COULD BE AN INFECTION.

24:12.552 --> 24:13.853
WE HAD HIM ON AZTREONAM
FOR THE E COLI.

24:13.886 --> 24:15.121
HE DIDN'T RESPOND.

24:15.154 --> 24:17.089
SCHISTOSOMIASIS WOULDN'T
RESPOND TO AZTREONAM.

24:17.123 --> 24:18.625
(House)
THAT'S A GREAT IDEA

24:18.658 --> 24:20.793
IF HE WAS RUNNING
A POLITICAL CAMPAIGN IN AFRICA.

24:20.827 --> 24:22.729
THE GUY HASN'T BEEN
OUT OF THE COUNTRY IN YEARS.

24:22.762 --> 24:25.131
WHO NEEDS TO TRAVEL WHEN
YOU'VE GOT A GIANT FISH TANK

24:25.164 --> 24:27.967
LOADED WITH TROPICAL FISH,
TROPICAL SNAILS

24:28.000 --> 24:30.637
CARRYING TROPICAL BACTERIA
LIKE SCHISTOSOMIASIS.

24:30.670 --> 24:32.572
WELL, BREAK INTO HIS HOME,

24:32.605 --> 24:34.907
GET ME SOME ESCARGOT.

24:34.941 --> 24:36.643
UNLESS YOU WANNA
ASK THE PATIENT'S PERMISSION

24:36.676 --> 24:38.678
AS A TRIBUTE
TO THE DEPARTED.

24:44.617 --> 24:46.052
NEED A MINUTE.

24:48.755 --> 24:50.523
YOU SAID YOU WERE GONNA
GIVE HER A CHANCE.

24:50.557 --> 24:51.524
I DID!

24:51.558 --> 24:52.725
SHE USED THAT OPPORTUNITY

24:52.759 --> 24:54.561
TO ENDANGER
OUR PATIENT'S LIFE.

24:54.594 --> 24:56.996
BY INSISTING HE RECEIVE
THE TREATMENT THAT HE ASKED FOR.

24:57.029 --> 24:58.631
THAT'S WHAT
I JUST SAID!

24:58.665 --> 25:00.533
YOUR TEAM IS THERE
TO CHALLENGE YOU.

25:00.567 --> 25:01.701
I DIDN'T FIRE HER
BECAUSE SHE'S A CHALLENGE--

25:01.734 --> 25:02.702
I FIRED HER BECAUSE

25:02.735 --> 25:03.903
SHE'S AN IMMUTABLE OBSTACLE!

25:03.936 --> 25:04.904
YOU GONNA MAKE ME
HIRE HER?

25:04.937 --> 25:05.872
HOW DO YOU THINK
THAT'LL WORK OUT?

25:05.905 --> 25:07.640
HOW DO YOU THINK
THAT'LL WORK OUT?

25:07.674 --> 25:08.641
HE'S RIGHT,
I'LL JUST--

25:08.675 --> 25:12.178
YOU WILL NOT
QUIT THIS JOB.

25:12.211 --> 25:13.546
WHAT IS GOING ON?

25:13.580 --> 25:15.281
I WANT HER GONE,
SHE WANTS TO BE GONE.

25:15.314 --> 25:17.283
WHY DO YOU CARE?

25:17.316 --> 25:18.718
YOU DON'T ACTUALLY THINK

25:18.751 --> 25:20.553
THAT SHE'S A YOUNGER
VERSION OF YOU?

25:20.587 --> 25:22.589
BECAUSE LET ME TELL YOU,
YOU'RE NOT THAT SMART

25:22.622 --> 25:23.556
OR MORAL.

25:23.590 --> 25:25.091
SOCIALLY AWKWARD, MAYBE.

25:25.124 --> 25:26.125
SHE'S A POTENTIAL STAR,

25:26.158 --> 25:27.126
AND I WANT HER
IN MY HOSPITAL.

25:27.159 --> 25:28.561
NO PROBLEM.

25:28.595 --> 25:31.097
JUST FIND HER
A DIFFERENT DEPARTMENT.

25:32.832 --> 25:35.602
(Chase)
I THINK I'VE FIGURED IT OUT.

25:35.635 --> 25:37.570
WHY TAUB DIDN'T LIKE MASTERS.

25:37.604 --> 25:40.239
NOW YOU'RE GETTING
INVOLVED IN THIS, TOO?

25:40.272 --> 25:41.641
MY PREVIOUS SOURCE
OF ENTERTAINMENT JUST GOT FIRED.

25:41.674 --> 25:42.575
EXACTLY.

25:42.609 --> 25:44.110
SHE'S GONE.
IT'S OVER.

25:44.143 --> 25:45.878
SHE'S TOTALLY MORAL
AND UPTIGHT,

25:45.912 --> 25:49.015
WHICH MADE TAUB FEEL BADLY
ABOUT HIS CHEATING.

25:49.048 --> 25:51.083
CAN WE GET A MOVE ON?

25:51.117 --> 25:51.984
(Foreman)
YOU DIDN'T LIKE HER

25:52.018 --> 25:53.786
EVEN BEFORE YOU KNEW
ABOUT HER MORALS.

25:53.820 --> 25:56.022
IT'S FROM THE MINUTE
HE SAW HER.

25:56.055 --> 25:57.724
SO...

25:57.757 --> 25:59.626
IT'S SOMETHING ABOUT
HOW SHE LOOKED.

25:59.659 --> 26:01.360
ALL RIGHT.

26:01.393 --> 26:03.763
NO SNAILS.
LET'S GET OUT OF HERE.

26:06.699 --> 26:08.200
HELLO?

26:08.234 --> 26:12.238
[phone ringing]

26:13.840 --> 26:15.107
YEAH.
[on phone]
IT'S FOREMAN.

26:15.141 --> 26:16.108
WHAT'D YOU FIND?

26:16.142 --> 26:17.309
NOTHING HELPFUL, BUT--

26:17.343 --> 26:18.745
(House)
THERE'S GOTTA BE SOMETHING.

26:18.778 --> 26:20.613
DUGAN'S GOING
COMPLETELY DOWNHILL.

26:20.647 --> 26:23.115
NOW FLUID'S COLLECTING
IN HIS CHEST.

26:23.149 --> 26:24.116
WHERE THE HELL
ARE YOU GUYS?

26:24.150 --> 26:27.319
IN JAIL.

26:27.353 --> 26:28.755
YOU GONNA COME BAIL US OUT?

26:28.788 --> 26:30.122
(House)
UH...

26:30.156 --> 26:32.091
KINDA BUSY.

26:37.229 --> 26:39.165
[Anderson on TV]
THANK YOU ALL FOR COMING DOWN
HERE AT THIS LATE HOUR.

26:39.198 --> 26:41.233
I ASSURE YOU
I WILL BE BRIEF.

26:41.267 --> 26:43.002
THERE HAS BEEN
A LOT OF DISCUSSION

26:43.035 --> 26:46.172
ABOUT AN ATTACK AD THAT LEAKED
ONLINE EARLIER THIS WEEK.

26:46.205 --> 26:48.240
AS I SAID MANY TIMES

26:48.274 --> 26:51.277
OVER THE PAST FEW DAYS--

26:51.310 --> 26:53.412
THERE YOU ARE.

26:53.445 --> 26:56.148
I WAS STARTING TO THINK
THAT MY HOLIER-THAN-THOU-DAR

26:56.182 --> 26:57.416
WAS MALFUNCTIONING.

26:57.449 --> 26:58.918
OUR PATIENT'S LIVER,

26:58.951 --> 27:01.654
KIDNEYS, AND LUNGS
ARE FAILING.

27:01.688 --> 27:03.690
I NEED YOU TO HELP ME
FIGURE OUT WHY.

27:03.723 --> 27:05.958
AS I RECALL,
YOU HAVE THREE ACTUAL DOCTORS

27:05.992 --> 27:07.326
YOU HAVEN FIRED TODAY.

27:07.359 --> 27:08.961
THEY'RE IN JAIL.

27:08.995 --> 27:10.162
WHAT? WHY?

27:10.196 --> 27:11.898
PROSTITUTION.

27:11.931 --> 27:13.032
SO YOU'RE REHIRED.

27:19.872 --> 27:22.174
IT ALL STARTED IN THE LIVER,
BUT WHERE IN THE LIVER?

27:22.208 --> 27:24.777
IF IN THE DUCTS, THEN PRIMARY
BILIARY CIRRHOSIS--

27:24.811 --> 27:26.145
YEAH, I DON'T NEED
TO HEAR YOUR IDEAS.

27:26.178 --> 27:27.246
JUST RETURN THE VOLLEY.

27:27.279 --> 27:29.448
PRIMARY SCLEROSING
CHOLANGITIS.

27:29.481 --> 27:30.983
NOPE.

27:31.017 --> 27:32.752
HIS VITAMIN A LEVEL
IS NORMAL.

27:32.785 --> 27:35.454
GALL BLADDER PROBLEMS
CAN AFFECT THE LIVER.

27:35.487 --> 27:36.723
CHOLECYSTITIS?

27:36.756 --> 27:38.725
SHH!

27:38.758 --> 27:39.892
HE'S TALKING
ABOUT OUR PATIENT.

27:39.926 --> 27:41.227
DID YOU JUST SHUSH ME?

27:41.260 --> 27:42.795
SHH!

27:42.829 --> 27:45.264
AND THOUGHT HE
WAS A FRIEND.

27:45.297 --> 27:47.133
THAT IS, UNTIL...

27:47.166 --> 27:50.369
HE LEAKED THIS HURTFUL,
HATEFUL AD.

27:50.402 --> 27:52.138
I THINK HE'S LYING.
DUGAN SAID--

27:52.171 --> 27:54.273
THE TECHNICAL TERM
IS SPEAKING.

27:54.306 --> 27:56.809
DUGAN VIOLATED MY TRUST.

27:56.843 --> 28:00.346
AND THEREFORE,
I HAVE NO OTHER RECOURSE

28:00.379 --> 28:03.082
THAN TO FIRE HIM
FROM MY CAMPAIGN.

28:03.115 --> 28:06.418
THANK YOU, AND THERE WILL BE
NO FURTHER QUESTIONS.

28:10.890 --> 28:12.058
THANKS FOR YOUR HELP.

28:15.261 --> 28:16.262
OH--

28:16.295 --> 28:18.297
AND YOU'RE FIRED AGAIN.

28:25.371 --> 28:27.273
HE SCREWED YOU.

28:27.306 --> 28:29.041
(Dugan)
THAT WAS A HELL OF A MOVE.

28:29.075 --> 28:30.743
USE THE AD
TO SHORE UP THE BASE,

28:30.777 --> 28:32.478
FIRE THE EXTREMIST
TO HOLD THE CENTER.

28:32.511 --> 28:34.781
NO, I MEAN
HE ACTUALLY SCREWED YOU.

28:34.814 --> 28:38.317
TAKING WEEKEND TRIPS
DOWN TO BUNBURY.

28:38.350 --> 28:40.086
HE'S GOT A RED BLOTCH
ON HIS HAND.

28:40.119 --> 28:42.154
THAT'S PALMAR ERYTHEMA.

28:42.188 --> 28:43.055
THAT, AND THE FACT
THAT HE'S GOT

28:43.089 --> 28:46.759
A PERMANENT SHEEN
OF NIXONIAN FLOP SWEAT.

28:46.793 --> 28:48.427
HE'S GOT HEPATITIS C

28:48.460 --> 28:49.428
WHICH EXPLAINS
ALL YOUR SYMPTOMS.

28:49.461 --> 28:50.362
THAT'S GREAT,

28:50.396 --> 28:52.932
BUT THE SENATOR AND I
HAVE NOT HAD SEX.

28:52.965 --> 28:54.801
WELL, THEN THE TWO OF YOU
SHOT UP TOGETHER.

28:54.834 --> 28:57.536
HOW MANY HIGH-FUNCTIONING
HEROIN USERS DO YOU KNOW?

28:57.569 --> 29:00.072
ACTUALLY, QUITE A FEW.

29:00.106 --> 29:03.442
LOOK, I KNOW
YOU'VE GOT HEP C.

29:03.475 --> 29:06.178
SO EITHER YOU SHARED
A BED TOGETHER,

29:06.212 --> 29:09.248
YOU SHARED A NEEDLE,

29:09.281 --> 29:12.785
OR YOU SHARED A STRAW.

29:12.819 --> 29:15.154
I'M TALKING ABOUT COKE,

29:15.187 --> 29:16.455
NOT COKE.

29:16.488 --> 29:18.524
YOU CAN GET HEP C
FROM DOING COCAINE?

29:18.557 --> 29:20.392
LOOK, I WILL DENY IT.

29:20.426 --> 29:21.861
DON'T CARE.

29:21.894 --> 29:23.229
THEY TESTED ME FOR HEP C
WHEN I CAME IN HERE.

29:23.262 --> 29:25.364
I DON'T HAVE IT.

29:25.397 --> 29:26.165
APPARENTLY YOUR LIVER
PICKED UP

29:26.198 --> 29:28.200
A FEW
OF YOUR CAMPAIGN TACTICS.

29:28.234 --> 29:29.301
IT'S HIDING
ALL YOUR SECRETS

29:29.335 --> 29:30.937
BY PRODUCING
CRYOGLOBULINS

29:30.970 --> 29:33.572
SO THE HEP C TESTS
COME BACK NEGATIVE.

29:33.605 --> 29:35.407
NOW, I COULD LOOK
FOR ALL THE ASSOCIATED TOXINS,

29:35.441 --> 29:37.476
BUT THE PLASMAPHERESIS
GOT RID OF THOSE.

29:37.509 --> 29:39.511
SO BASICALLY,
YOU'VE GOT A DISEASE,

29:39.545 --> 29:40.512
BUT THERE'S NO WAY
TO PROVE IT.

29:40.546 --> 29:41.814
IT'S PRETTY COOL,
HUH?

29:41.848 --> 29:43.816
WHAT IS THAT?

29:43.850 --> 29:46.953
THIS IS INTERFERON.

29:46.986 --> 29:49.956
IT DELAYS THE ONSET
OF RIGOR MORTIS.

29:54.060 --> 29:56.295
[door slamming]

29:56.328 --> 29:57.296
[keys jingling]

29:57.329 --> 29:59.498
WHEN DID YOUR LAWYER SAY
HE WAS COMING TO GET US?

29:59.531 --> 30:00.499
HE SAID,

30:00.532 --> 30:03.102
AND I'M QUOTING HERE,

30:03.135 --> 30:04.203
"SOON."

30:04.236 --> 30:05.337
I KNOW.

30:05.371 --> 30:08.174
THE REASON YOU HATED MASTERS
FROM THE MOMENT YOU SAW HER.

30:08.207 --> 30:10.276
COME ON.

30:10.309 --> 30:11.944
THAT WAS NOT
THE FIRST TIME YOU SAW HER.

30:11.978 --> 30:13.245
THAT IS BRILLIANT.

30:17.449 --> 30:19.051
IT'S REALLY NOT.

30:19.085 --> 30:22.188
IS THAT GUY SERIOUSLY
USING THE TOILET?

30:22.221 --> 30:24.156
OH, MY GOD,
HE'S SITTING DOWN.

30:24.190 --> 30:25.357
DON'T TRY
TO CHANGE THE SUBJECT.

30:25.391 --> 30:26.425
DID YOU SLEEP WITH HER?

30:26.458 --> 30:27.593
NO WONDER HE'S IN JAIL.

30:27.626 --> 30:29.461
ANYONE WHO WOULD DO THAT
HAS NO SHAME.

30:29.495 --> 30:31.130
OR MAYBE HE TRIED
TO SLEEP WITH HER,

30:31.163 --> 30:32.231
AND SHE SHOT HIM DOWN.

30:32.264 --> 30:34.100
[sighing]
I DON'T KNOW HER.

30:34.133 --> 30:35.101
[man grunting]

30:35.134 --> 30:36.335
IS HE GRUNTING?

30:36.368 --> 30:37.970
I THINK I HEAR GRUNTING.

30:38.004 --> 30:39.438
YOU REALIZE
WE'RE NOT GONNA DROP THIS.

30:39.471 --> 30:42.374
[man grunting]

30:42.408 --> 30:43.309
I DIDN'T SLEEP WITH HER.

30:43.342 --> 30:47.513
I INTERVIEWED HER
FOR HOPKINS MED SCHOOL.

30:47.546 --> 30:48.915
SO YOU'RE HOLDING A GRUDGE,

30:48.948 --> 30:50.649
BECAUSE SHE CHOSE
A DIFFERENT SCHOOL?

30:50.682 --> 30:53.152
WE TALKED FOR AN HOUR.

30:53.185 --> 30:55.487
SHE DIDN'T REMEMBER ME.

30:55.521 --> 30:59.191
SHE REMEMBERS THE 20TH DIGIT
OF SOME MATH CONSTANT,

30:59.225 --> 31:00.392
BUT SHE DOESN'T REMEMBER

31:00.426 --> 31:03.429
A GUY SHE HAD
A ONE-ON-ONE MEETING WITH.

31:03.462 --> 31:05.331
WELL, I BARELY
REMEMBER YOU.

31:05.364 --> 31:06.899
MYSTERY SOLVED.

31:06.933 --> 31:12.604
NOW WE CAN ALL
GO BACK TO OUR LIVES.

31:12.638 --> 31:16.208
[toilet flushing]

31:21.247 --> 31:23.449
GREAT NEWS.

31:23.482 --> 31:25.184
I'VE DECIDED
TO REHIRE YOU.

31:25.217 --> 31:27.086
FIND ANOTHER
SOUNDING BOARD.

31:27.119 --> 31:28.154
DUGAN'S GOT HEP C.

31:28.187 --> 31:29.255
I'M NOT DOING THIS.

31:29.288 --> 31:31.157
HE'S NOT RESPONDING
TO INTERFERON.

31:31.190 --> 31:34.693
YOU MUST THINK I HAVE
ABSOLUTELY NO SELF-ESTEEM.

31:34.726 --> 31:37.129
ETHICS AND SELF-ESTEEM?

31:37.163 --> 31:39.465
YOU REALLY ARE
A PAIN IN THE ASS.

31:39.498 --> 31:41.600
WHAT TREATS HEP C
BESIDES INTERFERON?

31:41.633 --> 31:43.135
NOW YOU WANT ME
TO TALK?

31:43.169 --> 31:44.336
YEAH.

31:44.370 --> 31:45.637
[scoffs]

31:45.671 --> 31:49.208
COME ON, STOP PRETENDING
YOU'RE NOT GONNA DO THIS.

31:49.241 --> 31:51.643
AS MUCH AS YOU HATE ME,
YOU HATE FAILING MORE.

31:51.677 --> 31:52.644
I DIDN'T FAIL.

31:52.678 --> 31:54.446
YOU FIRED ME.
REPEATEDLY.

31:54.480 --> 31:56.482
BUT IF YOU WALK AWAY NOW,
AFTER I JUST REHIRED YOU,

31:56.515 --> 31:57.516
THAT'S QUITTING.

32:01.320 --> 32:03.055
A GERMAN RESEARCH STUDY

32:03.089 --> 32:05.191
SHOWED THAT 15%
OF PATIENTS WITH HEP C

32:05.224 --> 32:06.725
WERE CURED
AFTER CONTRACTING HEP A.

32:06.758 --> 32:08.294
OF COURSE, OTHER STUDIES
HAVE SHOWN

32:08.327 --> 32:10.229
THAT UP TO 85% OF
DOUBLY-INFECTED PATIENTS

32:10.262 --> 32:11.430
DIE VERY QUICKLY.

32:11.463 --> 32:14.566
SO, IN THEORY, IF WE CAN FIND
SOMETHING THAT MIMICS HEP A--

32:14.600 --> 32:16.602
THERE'S ONE THING
THAT MIMICS HEP A...

32:16.635 --> 32:18.404
HEP A.

32:18.437 --> 32:20.239
GOOD WORK.

32:20.272 --> 32:21.240
YOU'RE FIRED.

32:21.273 --> 32:22.241
NO!

32:25.677 --> 32:27.246
HEP A COULD CURE HIM.

32:27.279 --> 32:28.647
BETTER CHANCE
IT'LL KILL HIM.

32:28.680 --> 32:30.582
TELL THE LAB TO RELEASE
A HEP A CULTURE TO ME.

32:30.616 --> 32:31.583
WE'LL SEE WHO'S RIGHT.

32:31.617 --> 32:32.718
IT'S NOT
AN APPROVED TREATMENT

32:32.751 --> 32:34.253
AND EXPOSES US TO LIABILITY.

32:34.286 --> 32:36.288
THERE'S NO WAY
I CAN LET YOU DO THIS.

32:36.322 --> 32:39.425
THAT'S AN EXTREMELY
COWARDLY POSITION.

32:39.458 --> 32:41.360
LISTEN TO THE GENIUS.

32:41.393 --> 32:43.262
YOU'RE THE ONE THAT INSISTED
HE RUN THIS BY ME.

32:43.295 --> 32:46.332
IT'S PROPER PROTOCOL
FOR AN UNCONVENTIONAL TREATMENT.

32:46.365 --> 32:48.334
BUT WE SHOULDN'T COMPROMISE
PATIENT CARE

32:48.367 --> 32:50.136
JUST TO AVOID LAWSUITS.

32:50.169 --> 32:51.170
WHAT ABOUT THE FACT
THAT WE DON'T

32:51.203 --> 32:53.272
HAVE ANY PROOF
HE ACTUALLY HAS HEP C?

32:53.305 --> 32:55.707
THAT IS A PERFECTLY
VALID OBJECTION.

32:55.741 --> 32:56.708
DON'T LISTEN TO HER.

32:56.742 --> 32:57.876
SHE DOESN'T EVEN
WORK FOR ME.

32:57.909 --> 33:00.612
IF YOU REALLY THINK THAT THIS
IS THE ONLY WAY TO CURE HIM,

33:00.646 --> 33:02.248
I WILL RISK
THE LAWSUIT.

33:02.281 --> 33:05.484
BUT I NEED TO KNOW THAT HE
ACTUALLY HAS THE DISEASE.

33:05.517 --> 33:06.552
GET ME PROOF.

33:06.585 --> 33:08.287
I'VE GIVEN YOU--
PROOF!

33:08.320 --> 33:10.622
GET ME PROOF
HE HAS HEP C,

33:10.656 --> 33:12.391
AND THEN YOU CAN
GIVE HIM HEP A.

33:12.424 --> 33:14.026
I CAN'T.

33:14.060 --> 33:15.027
YOU'LL FIGURE
SOMETHING OUT.

33:15.061 --> 33:18.130
THE TWO OF YOU HAVE A COMBINED
I.Q. NORTH OF 300.

33:19.598 --> 33:22.601
THAT'S ALSO TRUE
OF FIVE MORONS.

33:23.769 --> 33:26.738
GO. WORK.

33:26.772 --> 33:27.739
(Masters)
SO WHAT DO WE DO NOW?

33:27.773 --> 33:30.209
WELL, CONSIDERING THE FACT

33:30.242 --> 33:31.643
THAT I'M ABOUT TO DO
SOMETHING UNETHICAL--

33:31.677 --> 33:33.679
OH, RIGHT, YEAH--
I'M FIRED.

33:36.215 --> 33:38.384
(House)
MISSED YOU.

33:38.417 --> 33:40.352
WE NEED A FALSE POSITIVE
HEP C TEST.

33:40.386 --> 33:41.820
(Foreman)
AND WHY WOULD WE
WANT TO DO THAT?

33:41.853 --> 33:44.556
THE WORLD CHANGES
WHEN YOU'RE ON THE INSIDE.

33:44.590 --> 33:46.258
YOU JUST GOTTA ROLL WITH IT
ONCE YOU GET OUT.

33:46.292 --> 33:47.626
(Chase)
YOU THINK HE CONTRACTED
HEP C

33:47.659 --> 33:49.195
FROM THE SENATOR, RIGHT?

33:49.228 --> 33:50.629
TEST ANDERSON.

33:50.662 --> 33:52.731
IF IT'S POSITIVE, THAT'S
EVIDENCE DUGAN HAS IT, TOO.

33:52.764 --> 33:54.566
EVIDENCE, NOT PROOF.

33:54.600 --> 33:56.135
ARE WE PRESENTING THIS
TO A JURY OF OUR PEERS?

33:56.168 --> 33:57.303
THAT SHOULD BE ENOUGH
FOR CUDDY.

33:57.336 --> 33:58.237
SHOULD BE,
BUT IT WON'T BE.

33:58.270 --> 34:01.273
(Taub)
THE TEST FOR HEP C
IS 99.9% ACCURATE.

34:01.307 --> 34:03.175
THAT MEANS ONE
IN EVERY THOUSAND TESTS

34:03.209 --> 34:04.176
IS A FALSE POSITIVE.

34:04.210 --> 34:06.145
WE DO ENOUGH,

34:06.178 --> 34:07.213
MAYBE WE GET LUCKY.

34:07.246 --> 34:09.815
I SMELL LIKE JAIL.

34:09.848 --> 34:12.484
FALSE FALSE POSITIVE.

34:12.518 --> 34:13.519
THAT'S THE BEST
WE CAN DO?

34:16.188 --> 34:17.223
OKAY, GO DO IT.

34:45.317 --> 34:49.121
I HAVE A PROBLEM.

34:49.155 --> 34:50.289
A MEDICAL PROBLEM

34:50.322 --> 34:55.294
WHICH COULD BECOME...

34:55.327 --> 34:57.596
I HAVE LIED TO CUDDY
10,000 TIMES.

34:57.629 --> 35:01.600
HOW DO YOU THINK SHE'D FEEL
ABOUT 10,001?

35:01.633 --> 35:05.237
I THINK YOU PROBABLY
ALREADY KNOW THE ANSWER.

35:05.271 --> 35:07.206
BUT IT DOESN'T
MAKE ANY SENSE.

35:07.239 --> 35:09.475
YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND
WHY A WOMAN MIGHT BE UPSET

35:09.508 --> 35:10.542
BECAUSE HER BOYFRIEND
LIED TO HER?

35:10.576 --> 35:12.444
I WOULDN'T BE LYING
AS HER BOYFRIEND.

35:12.478 --> 35:13.912
I'D BE LYING
AS HER EMPLOYEE.

35:13.945 --> 35:16.448
THAT'S NOT
HOW RELATIONSHIPS WORK.

35:16.482 --> 35:18.650
MY PATIENT IS GONNA DIE.

35:22.721 --> 35:24.323
DOES THE LIE GUARANTEE
HE'LL LIVE?

35:24.356 --> 35:26.325
NO.

35:26.358 --> 35:27.393
YOU GOT TWO CHOICES:

35:27.426 --> 35:30.262
TO BE HONEST AND FACE
THE MEDICAL CONSEQUENCES,

35:30.296 --> 35:32.231
OR LIE AND FACE
THE PERSONAL CONSEQUENCES.

36:06.332 --> 36:08.467
NOW THAT YOU'RE MY DOCTOR,
YOU, UH...

36:08.500 --> 36:09.701
YOU CAN'T TELL ANYBODY,
RIGHT?

36:09.735 --> 36:12.604
WHO'D LEAK A STORY
ABOUT A SITTING SENATOR

36:12.638 --> 36:14.706
WHO GOT HEP C
FROM DOING COCAINE?

36:19.811 --> 36:21.713
YOU DIDN'T FILL OUT
ANY PAPERWORK.

36:21.747 --> 36:24.883
I'M GONNA RUN THIS TEST
UNDER AN ASSUMED NAME.

36:26.385 --> 36:27.986
TRUST ME--

36:28.019 --> 36:29.488
NO ONE WILL EVER KNOW
YOU WERE HERE.

36:38.697 --> 36:41.233
BLOOD TEST CONFIRMING
HEP C.

36:41.267 --> 36:42.234
HE GOT SICKER,

36:42.268 --> 36:43.469
HIS VIRAL LOAD CAME UP,

36:43.502 --> 36:47.639
FINALLY SHOWED UP
ON THE TEST.

36:47.673 --> 36:50.342
THANK YOU.

36:50.376 --> 36:51.443
THERE WAS A TIME

36:51.477 --> 36:53.412
WHEN YOU WOULD HAVE
COMPLETELY IGNORED MY REQUEST.

36:53.445 --> 36:54.846
THAT MEANS A LOT

36:54.880 --> 36:56.682
THAT YOU RESPECT ME ENOUGH
TO DO THIS.

36:56.715 --> 36:58.817
I'VE COME A LONG WAY,
BABY.

36:58.850 --> 37:02.654
NOW, IF YOU WOULD ONLY
HIRE A NEW TEAM MEMBER.

37:02.688 --> 37:06.625
I'M ON IT.

37:06.658 --> 37:08.627
[dishes clinking]

37:08.660 --> 37:10.762
[people talking]

37:10.796 --> 37:13.665
[footsteps approaching]

37:13.699 --> 37:15.767
HOW'D YOU LIKE
TO COME WORK FOR ME?

37:15.801 --> 37:18.737
IT'S LIKE I'M ON
A MOBIUS STRIP.

37:18.770 --> 37:19.805
WE'VE HAD
THIS CONVERSATION.

37:19.838 --> 37:21.507
YOU WANT THIS JOB.

37:21.540 --> 37:23.775
[sighs]

37:23.809 --> 37:25.043
PROVE YOURSELF TO ME,

37:25.076 --> 37:26.612
NO MORE GAMES.

37:26.645 --> 37:28.580
AT LEAST,
THE CURRENT GAME ENDS.

37:28.614 --> 37:29.615
OTHERS MAY START.

37:29.648 --> 37:33.885
YOU HAVE MY
DEEPLY-FLAWED WORD.

37:33.919 --> 37:36.054
WHAT DO I HAVE TO DO?

37:36.087 --> 37:39.458
GET DUGAN
TO LET US GIVE HIM HEP A.

37:39.491 --> 37:41.760
AND WHILE YOU'RE FIGURING OUT
THE BEST WAY

37:41.793 --> 37:42.961
TO COAX A PATIENT
INTO A TREATMENT

37:42.994 --> 37:45.063
THAT HAS
AN 85% MORTALITY RATE,

37:45.096 --> 37:46.998
HERE'S SOME ADVICE:
DON'T.

37:47.032 --> 37:48.767
I'M NOT
GONNA LIE TO HIM.

37:48.800 --> 37:50.669
YOU HAVE A MATH DEGREE.

37:50.702 --> 37:52.037
SO LET'S SEE
IF YOU CAN FOLLOW ALONG HERE.

37:52.070 --> 37:54.840
YOU LIE TO HIM,
HE DEFINITELY CONSENTS,

37:54.873 --> 37:55.974
HE MIGHT LIVE.

37:56.007 --> 37:57.876
YOU TELL HIM THE TRUTH
LIKE LAST TIME,

37:57.909 --> 37:58.944
HE MIGHT NOT CONSENT,

37:58.977 --> 38:03.048
HE DEFINITELY DIES.

38:03.081 --> 38:04.983
REMIND ME WHAT'S SO WRONG
ABOUT LYING?

38:07.686 --> 38:13.359
WE'RE GOING TO INJECT YOU
WITH HEPATITIS A.

38:13.392 --> 38:15.594
THAT DOESN'T SOUND
LIKE MEDICINE.

38:15.627 --> 38:17.329
I KNOW IT SEEMS
COUNTER-INTUITIVE,

38:17.363 --> 38:18.664
BUT IN SOME PEOPLE,

38:18.697 --> 38:20.666
THE VIRUS CAN ENHANCE
IMMUNE FUNCTION

38:20.699 --> 38:22.568
AND CLEAR OUT
THE HEPATITIS C.

38:22.601 --> 38:23.769
SOME.

38:23.802 --> 38:25.604
HOW MANY
WE TALKING ABOUT?

38:30.509 --> 38:31.743
A FAIR AMOUNT.

38:31.777 --> 38:33.078
GIVE ME
A PERCENTAGE.

38:33.111 --> 38:34.846
WHAT ARE THE ODDS
OF THIS THING WORKING?

38:34.880 --> 38:37.716
[breathes deeply]

38:37.749 --> 38:40.719
THERE IS AN 85% CHANCE
THAT THIS WILL KILL YOU.

38:44.656 --> 38:45.657
(Dugan)
SO, YOU WANNA

38:45.691 --> 38:48.126
GIVE ME SOMETHING THAT WORKS

38:48.159 --> 38:50.128
15% BETTER THAN ARSENIC?

38:50.161 --> 38:52.130
WELL, TECHNICALLY,
IT WORKS INFINITELY BETTER

38:52.163 --> 38:53.532
BECAUSE ARSENIC HAS

38:53.565 --> 38:56.402
A 0% CH--CHANCE.

38:59.738 --> 39:01.006
THIS IS YOUR ONLY SHOT.

39:01.039 --> 39:03.509
BOTH DR. HOUSE AND I
BELIEVE THAT.

39:03.542 --> 39:05.711
HE FAKED A BLOOD TEST
IN ORDER TO GET YOU APPROVED

39:05.744 --> 39:07.713
FOR THIS TREATMENT.

39:07.746 --> 39:08.714
AND THEN HE TRIED
TO BRIBE ME

39:08.747 --> 39:09.915
INTO LYING TO YOU
ABOUT THE RISKS.

39:09.948 --> 39:12.418
IF EITHER OF THOSE INCIDENTS
CAME TO LIGHT,

39:12.451 --> 39:13.685
HE WOULD BE SUSPENDED

39:13.719 --> 39:15.454
AND PROBABLY LOSE
HIS LICENSE.

39:15.487 --> 39:17.389
OH, I'M SURE SOME OTHER PEOPLE
WOULD SUFFER.

39:19.558 --> 39:22.127
HE'S RISKING HIS CAREER
TO GIVE YOU THIS CHANCE.

39:22.160 --> 39:26.965
HE WOULDN'T DO THAT
IF THERE WAS ANY OTHER CHOICE.

39:32.604 --> 39:34.072
I DID IT.
AND I DIDN'T HAVE TO LIE.

39:34.105 --> 39:35.941
AND YOU FEEL GOOD
ABOUT THAT?

39:35.974 --> 39:37.108
YES.

39:37.142 --> 39:38.510
SO I'M HIRING
AN IDIOT.

39:38.544 --> 39:39.811
YOU CAN PRETEND
YOU WANTED ME TO LIE,

39:39.845 --> 39:41.079
BUT YOU DIDN'T.

39:41.112 --> 39:42.848
YOU WANT THE PEOPLE ON YOUR TEAM
TO CHALLENGE YOU

39:42.881 --> 39:43.849
OTHERWISE YOU'D
JUST BE A BULLY

39:43.882 --> 39:44.983
INSTEAD OF A GREAT DOCTOR.

39:45.016 --> 39:48.086
YOU HIRED ME BECAUSE I DON'T
COMPROMISE MY PRINCIPALS.

39:48.119 --> 39:50.722
OR I WANT A FRONT ROW SEAT
WHEN YOU WAKE UP

39:50.756 --> 39:53.559
AND REALIZE HOW USELESS
YOUR PRINCIPALS ARE.

39:53.592 --> 39:55.160
I DON'T WANT YOU
TO JUST LIE TO A PATIENT.

39:55.193 --> 39:56.895
I WANT YOU TO WANT
TO LIE TO A PATIENT.

39:56.928 --> 39:59.565
IT'S NOT GONNA HAPPEN.

40:00.899 --> 40:02.734
SEE YOU TOMORROW.

40:09.808 --> 40:11.810
[exhales]

40:27.926 --> 40:30.128
I HEARD DUGAN IS ALREADY
RESPONDING TO TREATMENT.

40:30.161 --> 40:33.599
YEAH, HIS ALT LEVEL IS ALREADY
BEGINNING TO NORMALIZE.

40:33.632 --> 40:36.668
I WANTED TO APOLOGIZE
FOR THE WAY--

40:36.702 --> 40:37.669
UH, WAIT--

40:37.703 --> 40:40.005
YOU INTERVIEWED ME, RIGHT?

40:41.873 --> 40:42.841
FOR HOPKINS?

40:42.874 --> 40:46.645
OH, MY GOD,
YOU'RE RIGHT.

40:46.678 --> 40:48.480
[laughing]

40:48.514 --> 40:50.782
WOW,
THAT MEMORY OF YOURS.

40:50.816 --> 40:53.018
I WANTED TO SAY SOMETHING
THE FIRST DAY.

40:53.051 --> 40:55.787
I FELT REALLY AWKWARD
ABOUT THE WHOLE THING.

40:55.821 --> 40:58.123
DON'T WORRY
ABOUT IT.

40:58.156 --> 41:00.792
IS THIS GRANDMA'S TEA COZY?

41:00.826 --> 41:04.162
WHAT?

41:04.195 --> 41:05.263
NOTHING.

41:05.296 --> 41:06.498
I'LL SEE YOU
UPSTAIRS.

41:10.836 --> 41:12.070
IF I KNEW HIRING HER

41:12.103 --> 41:13.805
MEANT DEALING
WITH MEDICAL SCHOOL PAPERWORK,

41:13.839 --> 41:16.007
I MIGHT'VE RECONSIDERED.

41:16.041 --> 41:17.676
YOU REALLY GOT
NOTHING BETTER TO DO

41:17.709 --> 41:18.810
THAN WATCH ME SIGN THIS?

41:18.844 --> 41:20.111
AND MISS
THE ULTIMATE ADMISSION

41:20.145 --> 41:22.013
THAT I WAS RIGHT
ABOUT MASTERS ALL ALONG?

41:22.047 --> 41:24.516
SHE HAD ME WHEN SHE
CALLED YOU A COWARD.

41:24.550 --> 41:26.217
YOU HEADING OUT?

41:26.251 --> 41:27.853
I HAVE TO WORK LATE.

41:27.886 --> 41:32.023
GLOATING REQUIRES
A LOT OF PAPERWORK.

41:32.057 --> 41:33.258
[smacks]

41:39.164 --> 41:40.566
[cheers and applause]

41:40.599 --> 41:42.100
[Anderson on TV]
THANK YOU, NEW JERSEY

41:42.133 --> 41:46.037
FOR REELECTING ME
TO THE UNITED STATES SENATE.

41:46.071 --> 41:47.973
[cheers and applause]

41:48.006 --> 41:49.808
WE RAN A POSITIVE CAMPAIGN,

41:49.841 --> 41:53.845
A CAMPAIGN ABOUT THE DIRE ISSUES
FACING THIS GREAT NATION.

41:53.879 --> 41:56.147
[cheering]

41:56.181 --> 41:58.684
THERE ARE MANY PEOPLE
WHO GAVE THEIR ALL

41:58.717 --> 41:59.685
FOR THIS CAMPAIGN.

41:59.718 --> 42:01.286
BUT THERE IS ONE PERSON

42:01.319 --> 42:05.323
THAT STANDS OUT AMONG THEM.

42:05.356 --> 42:07.125
MY BEAUTIFUL WIFE,
LORETTA.

42:07.158 --> 42:08.126
LORETTA.

42:08.159 --> 42:11.129
[applause]

42:11.162 --> 42:13.164
THANK YOU.

42:17.636 --> 42:19.170
DO YOU KNOW WHERE
THE SENATOR'S RECORDS ARE?

42:19.204 --> 42:21.940
HOUSE WAS TREATING ANDERSON'S
CAMPAIGN MANAGER,

42:21.973 --> 42:23.609
NOT THE SENATOR HIMSELF.

42:23.642 --> 42:24.776
OH.

42:24.810 --> 42:25.911
WHY DID YOU THINK HE
WAS THE PATIENT?

42:25.944 --> 42:27.579
HOUSE SAW HIM
IN THE CLINIC.

42:27.613 --> 42:28.680
I GUESS IT WASN'T MEDICAL.

42:28.714 --> 42:30.816
WHEN?

42:30.849 --> 42:32.684
FRIDAY.
AROUND 3.

42:34.252 --> 42:36.955
HOUSE'S TEAM RAN A HEP C TEST
ON JOE DUGAN ON FRIDAY.

42:36.988 --> 42:37.989
CAN YOU LOOK UP THE TIME?

42:40.926 --> 42:44.596
CHASE, TAUB, AND FOREMAN
WERE RUNNING TESTS ALL NIGHT.

42:44.630 --> 42:46.665
ALL NEGATIVE.

42:47.933 --> 42:49.801
POSITIVE TEST AT...

42:49.835 --> 42:51.903
3:17 P.M.

42:51.937 --> 42:53.605
HOUSE RAN IT HIMSELF.

42:55.340 --> 42:56.642
IS EVERYTHING OKAY?

42:56.675 --> 42:58.977
I DON'T THINK SO.
