01:06.720 --> 01:08.920
Your Honor,
everyone has their own strategy.

01:10.080 --> 01:12.120
And the defense made a decision

01:12.800 --> 01:15.680
not to do any testing.
That is their choice.

01:16.320 --> 01:20.160
Defense counsel is not bound by
the defense that was used at trial.

01:21.880 --> 01:25.720
But even here, their own witness,
he's still saying it's an accident.

01:25.800 --> 01:27.560
Well, certainly the State
disagrees with him,

01:27.760 --> 01:30.120
but this is their witness, their evidence.

01:30.400 --> 01:33.640
And based on their evidence,
the DNA, if there is any,

01:33.720 --> 01:36.640
would not affect, in any way,
his determination

01:36.960 --> 01:38.280
that this is an accident,

01:38.600 --> 01:41.760
and therefore, would not be prejudicial
to the defendant.

01:42.600 --> 01:44.520
And it's for those reasons, Your Honor,

01:44.600 --> 01:46.520
that the defendant
has failed to meet his burden

01:46.640 --> 01:50.520
for purposes of this hearing in showing
that there's been a due process violation.

01:50.960 --> 01:54.160
And therefore, Your Honor,
the State would ask that you deny

01:54.600 --> 01:56.160
the defendant's motion to dismiss.

01:56.720 --> 02:01.440
Well, let me ask you this, Mr. Dornfried,
what if I do that?

02:01.520 --> 02:07.040
What if I deny the defendant's motion
and this case goes to trial?

02:07.520 --> 02:10.960
She can still raise the issue about

02:11.480 --> 02:14.480
the condition of this evidence
to the jury.

02:15.160 --> 02:16.000
Yes, sir.

02:16.560 --> 02:18.360
- So, are you finished? All right.
- Yes, sir.

02:18.440 --> 02:20.000
- Yes?
- Thank you, Your Honor.

02:20.080 --> 02:22.440
From the very beginning,
there have been issues

02:22.520 --> 02:27.920
with how evidence potentially
containing DNA was handled,

02:28.400 --> 02:31.000
but what becomes more egregious

02:31.520 --> 02:35.200
and bespeaks bad faith
on the part of the State,

02:35.720 --> 02:38.800
is the actions of two individuals

02:38.880 --> 02:41.480
who have since been found by this court

02:41.560 --> 02:44.960
to basically have acted in bad faith
in the past.

02:45.600 --> 02:48.240
The request for examination
of physical evidence

02:48.320 --> 02:50.680
submitted by the Durham Police Department

02:50.840 --> 02:55.680
requesting DNA analysis
and blood spatter analysis,

02:56.320 --> 03:00.280
and this was dated January 17th, 2002,

03:00.920 --> 03:03.080
that it was transferred to the SBI,

03:03.800 --> 03:06.080
in the comments, specifically says,

03:06.680 --> 03:07.720
"Attention:

03:07.800 --> 03:14.160
all clothing, shoes, and socks
are to go to Duane Deaver and Susie Barker

03:14.240 --> 03:17.480
for blood spatter prior to DNA."

03:18.480 --> 03:24.440
The clothing was moved over, first of all,
to Duane Deaver and Susie Barker.

03:25.120 --> 03:29.200
They diverted the request
of the Durham Police Department.

03:30.480 --> 03:33.880
That's bad faith. At that point in time,

03:33.960 --> 03:36.880
Mr. Deaver had his theory

03:38.240 --> 03:40.680
already laid out in his mind.

03:41.040 --> 03:44.360
And every step he took was an effort

03:44.480 --> 03:46.960
to further his theory.

03:47.480 --> 03:49.600
We're now looking at a new trial,

03:49.960 --> 03:51.840
we're starting from scratch.

03:52.320 --> 03:55.440
We say, let us have the evidence.

03:55.520 --> 03:58.200
Let's have it tested for DNA

03:58.320 --> 04:03.120
to see whose DNA is on
Kathleen Peterson's clothing.

04:03.880 --> 04:05.240
We cannot do that.

04:05.320 --> 04:10.760
We cannot have
reliable DNA testing of her clothing.

04:11.400 --> 04:16.120
Did those clothes only have
Kathleen Peterson's DNA on them?

04:16.519 --> 04:20.760
Did they only have Kathleen Peterson
and Michael Peterson's DNA on them?

04:21.839 --> 04:25.040
Or do they have
a third person's DNA on them?

04:25.120 --> 04:26.800
And we don't know that.

04:27.000 --> 04:30.680
Our efforts to represent Mr. Peterson

04:30.960 --> 04:33.440
are absolutely hamstrung.

04:33.720 --> 04:36.280
And because of the situation
being presented

04:36.920 --> 04:41.720
to defense counsel, to my client,
and to the court,

04:42.920 --> 04:46.800
there is nothing that can be done
to restore his due process right

04:47.120 --> 04:49.120
to defend himself and present

04:49.520 --> 04:52.600
an appropriate and a fair defense.

04:53.720 --> 04:54.760
And therefore,

04:55.680 --> 05:01.000
we respectfully ask you to dismiss
the charges against Michael Peterson.

05:01.960 --> 05:04.760
Your Honor, it is a smart strategy
to cover your bases.

05:04.840 --> 05:06.880
That's what she's saying she's doing now.

05:07.040 --> 05:10.080
We're saying it's an accident,
but it's not an accident, he didn't do it.

05:10.920 --> 05:13.960
Previous counsel didn't do that,
but the potential was there.

05:14.440 --> 05:16.600
These are seasoned, talented attorneys

05:17.000 --> 05:19.440
who knew that those
were the options to take,

05:19.760 --> 05:21.080
that were available.

05:21.400 --> 05:24.080
And their strategy was
to only take one route.

05:25.040 --> 05:27.960
All right, Ms. Darrow, um...

05:28.520 --> 05:32.320
I don't mind finding a due process
violation if it's there, but...

05:33.040 --> 05:37.000
the kind that they are wanting
the court to find, apparently,

05:37.160 --> 05:39.800
since they've reversed four of my cases,

05:40.200 --> 05:44.040
is the kind that Mr. Dornfried
is arguing should be there, so...

05:44.400 --> 05:47.720
If the analysis had not been diverted

05:48.200 --> 05:53.360
and Kathleen Peterson's clothing
had been checked for DNA

05:53.440 --> 05:55.920
and tested to see whose DNA was on it,

05:56.320 --> 06:00.240
it wouldn't matter if David Rudolf
had thrown the shorts on the floor

06:00.320 --> 06:03.280
and stomped on them.
It would not have mattered

06:03.400 --> 06:07.280
because an initial DNA analysis
was conducted.

06:08.280 --> 06:12.560
Here we are in 2016, however,
and it can't be done,

06:13.520 --> 06:16.360
and that's where my client is harmed.

06:17.000 --> 06:20.280
We just can't adequately present
a defense

06:20.360 --> 06:22.560
other than to say, "He didn't do it."

06:23.600 --> 06:24.840
And that's not enough.

06:26.320 --> 06:27.360
It's not enough.

06:27.960 --> 06:29.560
And that's an injustice.

06:30.200 --> 06:31.440
That's an unfairness,

06:31.520 --> 06:34.760
and it's a substantive and procedural
due process violation

06:34.840 --> 06:36.080
of my client's rights.

06:37.440 --> 06:38.440
Thank you, Your Honor.

06:39.840 --> 06:40.680
All right.

06:43.240 --> 06:45.720
The court is going to determine that

06:46.320 --> 06:47.480
it does not find

06:48.120 --> 06:51.640
a due process violation.

06:53.160 --> 06:55.240
The defendant's motion is going to be...

06:56.240 --> 06:57.120
dismissed.

06:58.640 --> 07:02.440
The State's gonna prepare an order
with the appropriate findings

07:02.520 --> 07:05.640
of fact and conclusions of law.

07:06.680 --> 07:10.280
Now I need for you all to tell me
when this case is gonna be tried.

07:14.200 --> 07:16.240
Is there any date you would prefer?

07:19.800 --> 07:20.640
May 1st?

07:21.120 --> 07:24.040
The court's in recess
until tomorrow morning at 9:30.

07:27.600 --> 07:30.160
Well, I'm sorry.

07:30.800 --> 07:31.960
I'm sorry.

07:32.520 --> 07:36.960
I'm sorry for your girls and your son,
who are very upset right now.

07:37.040 --> 07:39.240
-
-

07:55.440 --> 07:58.200
- Do you want to talk about the trial?
- No, I don't.

07:59.000 --> 08:00.840
No, Julie, no.

08:00.920 --> 08:02.960
You can probably imagine, right?

08:04.640 --> 08:05.480
Right.

08:07.000 --> 08:10.120
No hard evidence, no nothing,
you don't understand.

08:16.320 --> 08:19.120
My poor daughters. God Almighty.

08:32.280 --> 08:35.039
Well, fuck.

08:46.440 --> 08:49.320
- How are you?
- Great. Thank you. Appreciate it. Thanks.

08:53.520 --> 08:56.440
Gave them $8 to get fucked.
Never heard of that.

09:58.320 --> 09:59.560
Oh, let me get this.

10:05.640 --> 10:08.560
I can't believe it.
I just can't believe it.

10:09.280 --> 10:11.560
All these-- Five years for this.

10:12.640 --> 10:14.480
- It's been five years?
- Yep.

10:14.600 --> 10:15.560
Yep.

10:15.640 --> 10:18.560
God, I'm sorry for you guys.
I thought this would be...

10:19.200 --> 10:22.160
a moment of redemption for you, at least,

10:22.400 --> 10:23.760
and release, we can be--

10:23.840 --> 10:27.120
- I thought it was gonna be for you, too.
- I'm done with this shit. I don't care.

10:27.240 --> 10:29.120
Yeah, yeah, but...

10:31.800 --> 10:35.600
You know, victory, you can do that
on your own. You can do your little...

10:36.000 --> 10:36.920
"Oh, I won!"

10:37.480 --> 10:40.400
But when you're down in the dumps,
and it's...

10:40.920 --> 10:43.520
"Shit!" ...it's nice to have those...

10:44.400 --> 10:45.880
you love nearby.

10:46.640 --> 10:47.600
You know?

11:02.960 --> 11:05.720
Well, I think I'll go throw myself
off the window now.

11:08.720 --> 11:09.800
Well, I'll be there--

11:09.880 --> 11:12.840
Now that you've comforted me so much.
"Bye! I'm outta here!"

11:14.080 --> 11:18.000
I was gonna go buy some cigarettes
and Margaret was looking inside.

11:18.080 --> 11:20.920
And I was like, "Do you want anything?"
And she was like,

11:21.120 --> 11:23.160
"Can you get me some hope?"

11:25.640 --> 11:27.640
"Unless they have hope in there..."

11:28.080 --> 11:30.760
Right? It's called "Crown Royal."

11:54.720 --> 11:58.720
Get this over for me. End it, David.
Free me and my children from...

11:58.800 --> 12:01.720
...the bondage of the judicial system.

12:09.880 --> 12:13.200
I've got a lot of
emotional baggage tied up in this...

12:13.280 --> 12:14.120
I know.

12:14.200 --> 12:17.400
...as well. You know? Um, so...

12:17.720 --> 12:21.440
Yeah, it's not as though
I come to this with a clean slate.

12:21.520 --> 12:22.360
I know.

12:22.440 --> 12:25.120
- Emotionally.
- Oh, with lots of wounds, too.

12:25.200 --> 12:26.600
Right. I know. I got it.

12:27.280 --> 12:29.960
Yeah. So I need to think about it. Um...

12:30.040 --> 12:33.000
And the other thing
I need to think about is, um...

12:34.160 --> 12:36.840
I'm not sure that after
you get your ass kicked

12:37.000 --> 12:40.160
would be the best time to negotiate.

12:40.360 --> 12:41.640
- Mm-hmm.
- Um...

12:42.440 --> 12:46.920
And I wonder whether...

12:47.840 --> 12:52.280
you know, there ought to be
a couple of motions filed first.

12:52.840 --> 12:54.200
For example,

12:54.800 --> 12:57.960
a motion to suppress

12:58.520 --> 13:02.080
everything that was found
as a result of that search warrant

13:02.160 --> 13:06.360
that was declared invalid
by the court of appeals.

13:06.760 --> 13:09.080
Which would include
all the computer shit.

13:09.160 --> 13:10.000
Right.

13:10.080 --> 13:14.520
And asking Hudson to reconsider his ruling
on the Germany stuff.

13:14.680 --> 13:17.560
Once you've filed those two motions,

13:17.640 --> 13:23.440
that might be a better time
to approach the DA's office.

13:24.000 --> 13:27.760
Well, I guess the other question
is financial. Um...

13:28.080 --> 13:30.040
What's the situation with your family?

13:30.120 --> 13:35.080
Is there any other source
to pay for doing any of this stuff?

13:35.160 --> 13:39.040
Nope. No, I--
No, David. There isn't.

13:39.520 --> 13:43.920
Uh, as you know, I'm indigent
and they'll certainly, you know--

13:44.120 --> 13:48.400
For you, it would be pro bono,
whatever the State pays to represent me,

13:48.480 --> 13:50.200
but it's whatever the hell it is.

13:50.280 --> 13:52.200
What? A hundred bucks an hour
or something like that?

13:52.280 --> 13:53.120
Whatever.

13:53.200 --> 13:54.240
Yeah.

13:54.320 --> 13:57.800
Well, that would require Orlando
to appoint me.

13:57.880 --> 14:02.560
As you can imagine, I am in kind of...
desperate straits.

14:02.640 --> 14:04.760
It looked to me like yesterday,

14:05.320 --> 14:10.360
uh, Hudson was, you know,
waiting for her to come up with something

14:10.440 --> 14:11.760
that would give him

14:12.000 --> 14:14.200
the grounds to do this,
and she never did it,

14:15.040 --> 14:17.160
but then he was also turning to Dornfried,

14:17.240 --> 14:19.720
saying, you know,
"What have you got for trial?"

14:20.400 --> 14:24.560
Uh, which isn't much, right? And I don't
believe they've even opened the boxes.

14:24.840 --> 14:26.640
I don't think that they've, you know--

14:26.760 --> 14:29.080
I don't think they want to retry
this case, David.

14:29.160 --> 14:32.480
No. Now all they've got
is Deborah Radisch...

14:32.560 --> 14:34.920
OK, David. I appreciate it.

14:35.040 --> 14:36.480
I'll give it some thought.

14:36.560 --> 14:38.440
I appreciate it. Thank you very much.

14:38.680 --> 14:39.760
All right. Bye-bye.

14:45.120 --> 14:48.040
Margaret, come here, I'll talk to you
about what's going on, sweetie pie.

14:48.720 --> 14:49.880
And Clay, come over here.

14:49.960 --> 14:53.280
Let me make sure you
fully understand this, OK?

14:54.080 --> 14:56.560
Please come over here, Margaret.
I forget, what--

14:56.640 --> 14:59.480
- "Get your ass over here."
- Get your ass over here.

15:00.240 --> 15:02.040
Margaret!

15:03.600 --> 15:05.480
Oh, it's the story of my life!

15:05.560 --> 15:09.480
Oh, God! Is there anyone here
who isn't always performing?

15:09.920 --> 15:12.240
All right.
You can sit on the sofa if you want.

15:12.320 --> 15:13.240
No? OK.

15:13.320 --> 15:15.120
No, I'd rather look up adoringly.

15:15.200 --> 15:18.040
Oh, much better! Here.
Let me start sitting on...

15:19.880 --> 15:22.480
- Oh, hi, Clay.
-

15:23.720 --> 15:27.360
First person I called this morning
was Marie Jude.

15:27.440 --> 15:29.040
She's very sorry for what happened,

15:29.120 --> 15:31.440
and I said, "Thank you,
you did a fine job."

15:31.800 --> 15:33.520
And I asked about

15:34.400 --> 15:38.360
the Alford plea, had Jim offered that?

15:39.000 --> 15:40.640
And she said no.

15:41.080 --> 15:43.520
So, I called David Rudolf

15:43.600 --> 15:46.360
to begin negotiations

15:46.920 --> 15:50.000
because I want this thing to end.
Right now.

15:50.160 --> 15:52.760
I want it just finished and be done with

15:53.120 --> 15:54.280
and we can go on.

15:54.360 --> 15:56.920
And David's response was, quite correctly,

15:57.000 --> 16:00.280
"You wouldn't want
to go to them now anyway,

16:00.600 --> 16:02.200
because you're in a weakened position.

16:02.280 --> 16:06.480
You just got your ass kicked, so
that's not when you go and ask somebody,

16:06.560 --> 16:08.880
'Oh, I give up. Could I have this?'"

16:08.960 --> 16:11.120
It's like having a shit hand in cards.

16:11.200 --> 16:13.280
You hold on for a while,
to try to bluff them.

16:13.360 --> 16:14.800
We'll see, you know.

16:15.120 --> 16:17.920
And so David says
we need to file a couple of motions

16:18.000 --> 16:20.640
to let them know we're going to pursue it

16:20.720 --> 16:23.000
and that he will carry this on.

16:23.080 --> 16:24.880
Whether he's gonna do it or not,
I don't know.

16:25.360 --> 16:29.440
I don't want to subject you guys
to two more years of this.

16:30.000 --> 16:34.080
I don't want to subject
the little kids to this.

16:34.160 --> 16:35.680
Which they'll be growing up

16:35.760 --> 16:40.080
for the next couple of years with this.
And, plus, I don't want to do it.

16:40.160 --> 16:41.240
I'm too old for this.

16:41.320 --> 16:44.960
I'd fight-- If it were just me, I might,
but then again,

16:45.040 --> 16:49.960
it's called, I think, "risk assessment."
Is the risk worth the payoff?

16:50.200 --> 16:52.680
And I don't think it is.

16:53.640 --> 16:54.840
What do you guys think?

16:55.320 --> 16:57.480
But he didn't say anything about,

16:57.640 --> 17:00.560
should you do a retrial
or should you do Alford plea?

17:00.640 --> 17:04.440
We only discussed Alford.
We didn't discuss the other.

17:04.880 --> 17:09.400
And the other would be starting
all over again, having certain things

17:10.440 --> 17:12.280
totally eliminated.

17:12.359 --> 17:15.359
Certainly anything with blood spatter,
anything now with DNA,

17:15.599 --> 17:17.400
- uh, the--
- Computers?

17:17.599 --> 17:21.079
The computer, the search is out,
but they can still bring back Brad,

17:21.160 --> 17:23.319
because, you know,
that wasn't part of the computer.

17:23.440 --> 17:26.040
They could bring back, uh, Liz.

17:26.640 --> 17:28.760
David thinks he could keep that out.

17:29.320 --> 17:33.920
Anything about Liz and Germany.
Get rid of that.

17:34.280 --> 17:35.320
- Please.
- Please.

17:35.400 --> 17:36.440
- Hmm?
- Please.

17:36.520 --> 17:38.280
Yeah, of course. Well, of course.

17:38.360 --> 17:40.360
Of course. Which is another main reason.

17:40.440 --> 17:41.600
But that's no guarantee.

17:41.680 --> 17:44.560
Last time, Hudson said,
"Oh, well, bring it in anyway." You know.

17:44.640 --> 17:49.240
I appreciate you hearing how hard it was
for us, and the idea of it being really

17:50.160 --> 17:53.640
so traumatizing and horrible, um...

17:54.240 --> 17:58.400
and I also want to honor
that drive to fight.

17:58.480 --> 18:01.400
If it means not coming to the trial
for a couple of the days

18:01.480 --> 18:04.600
where they're gonna talk about things
like our birth mother,

18:04.680 --> 18:06.720
I don't need to come to court every day.

18:06.800 --> 18:09.400
And I know that, but I don't
want to put you in that position.

18:09.480 --> 18:12.680
We're not... 20, 21...

18:12.760 --> 18:14.920
- No, you're not.
- ...19 anymore.

18:15.920 --> 18:18.440
We're not. You know,
going into that first trial,

18:18.520 --> 18:20.480
all of us were so young.

18:21.040 --> 18:22.400
- Really.
- Oh, yes.

18:22.480 --> 18:26.280
Martha was a freshman when Mom died.
We've been through a lot,

18:26.360 --> 18:29.560
and I think that...
that we've learned a lot, too,

18:29.640 --> 18:34.040
of how to manage our expectations,

18:34.120 --> 18:36.360
how to manage stress, how to--

18:36.480 --> 18:38.560
We're a much stronger family,

18:38.640 --> 18:41.840
and so, if we do decide to do a retrial,

18:41.920 --> 18:44.120
we'll be much better equipped
to handle it.

18:44.680 --> 18:45.520
Yeah.

18:46.560 --> 18:48.040
-
- Can I ask a question?

18:48.120 --> 18:49.960
What do we get from that? I mean...

18:50.560 --> 18:52.320
What do we care versus...

18:53.160 --> 18:54.760
I feel like it's the...

18:55.680 --> 18:56.960
- the principle of it.
- Exactly.

18:57.040 --> 18:58.960
Like, it's like you are free.

18:59.040 --> 19:01.120
I want you to be free of everything.

19:01.280 --> 19:06.160
I want you to be able to sell a book and
not worry if that money goes to Caitlin.

19:06.240 --> 19:08.840
I want you to have, like,
an untarnished name

19:08.920 --> 19:12.080
and to be able to go through this
and say, "I went through..."

19:12.320 --> 19:14.600
- How long has it been, 15 years?
- Yeah.

19:14.680 --> 19:18.560
"...15 years of hell, to say that
I made it through the other end

19:18.640 --> 19:20.800
and I am free

19:20.880 --> 19:22.800
and I don't have any claim over me,

19:22.880 --> 19:25.120
and they didn't win."

19:25.200 --> 19:28.800
I guess, like it's just principle,
it's justice.

19:28.880 --> 19:31.280
Justice is the most important thing,

19:31.360 --> 19:37.120
and we haven't gotten it,
and I think that that would be my hope,

19:37.200 --> 19:38.320
if we did go to trial,

19:38.400 --> 19:41.920
or if you didn't want to take it to trial,
was to have justice.

19:42.240 --> 19:43.760
Like, the purest form of it.

19:44.120 --> 19:48.080
You're innocent and you
should be honored as innocent.

19:49.360 --> 19:50.840
I don't agree at all.

19:50.920 --> 19:55.280
You've gone down these passageways and
you become entangled in this machinery.

19:55.600 --> 19:57.240
And you just need to get out of it.

19:57.320 --> 19:59.880
What's the point of winning a game
that's not a fair game?

19:59.960 --> 20:02.320
To say that, "Oh, I won,
or I've got justice"?

20:02.400 --> 20:04.600
I'm not saying that we should go
into a retrial,

20:04.680 --> 20:07.520
but I don't want to just lie down

20:07.600 --> 20:10.440
and take this and say,
"They've beaten us."

20:10.760 --> 20:12.200
Because that's not...

20:12.720 --> 20:15.520
We've been through way too much
to have to go through that

20:15.600 --> 20:17.120
and I think that right now,

20:17.480 --> 20:20.760
in our society, there are people

20:20.960 --> 20:24.120
who understand that the system is flawed
and it needs to change.

20:24.400 --> 20:29.360
And so, just stepping aside, I think,
could be a mistake.

20:29.560 --> 20:33.760
I just think that taking this lying down
is not what we should do.

20:34.320 --> 20:37.320
Just the idea that they're going to win,

20:37.400 --> 20:40.080
to say, "OK, I didn't do it,
but they win."

20:40.160 --> 20:42.560
Oh! I can't stand it. I can't.

20:43.600 --> 20:44.960
But you're right.

20:45.840 --> 20:47.360
And as Todd said on the phone,

20:48.000 --> 20:50.320
a little less eloquently...

20:50.440 --> 20:52.320
"Get out! Get out now!"

20:52.560 --> 20:55.000
- Same thing. You're right.
- Time is definitely on your side.

20:55.440 --> 20:58.120
It's all gonna be a lot of
talking back and forth

20:58.200 --> 21:00.960
between the DA
and the judge and the lawyers and...

21:01.520 --> 21:05.520
figuring things out,
how best for the State to save face,

21:05.600 --> 21:09.600
how best for Judge Hudson to feel
that he's done something correctly,

21:09.680 --> 21:12.480
that no one could question,
so he just wants someone to say,

21:12.560 --> 21:13.880
"Here's the path for you."

21:14.000 --> 21:16.640
And then, everybody wants
a way out of this mess.

21:16.720 --> 21:18.760
So, become untangled

21:18.840 --> 21:22.400
and disengage from this as quickly
and easily as possible for you

21:22.480 --> 21:23.960
and for everybody else.

21:24.920 --> 21:26.960
I like it. What do you think about that?

21:27.160 --> 21:29.960
I am terrified of the thought of...

21:31.000 --> 21:34.280
asking for justice again because I feel
like we've just been screwed

21:34.360 --> 21:37.680
left and right, like at every single
possible opportunity.

21:39.280 --> 21:41.760
As much as I would love justice, too,

21:41.840 --> 21:45.400
I'd very much more want you
out here with us.

21:46.360 --> 21:47.960
Well, how about a raise of hands?

21:48.040 --> 21:50.440
Anybody who believes in
the justice system, raise your hand.

21:52.360 --> 21:53.800
Whoo.

21:53.880 --> 21:55.320
Victory. You know?

21:55.400 --> 21:58.240
- Right.
- For me, it's being with my family and...

21:58.520 --> 22:00.520
being able to go outside
and breathe fresh air

22:00.600 --> 22:03.360
and look up at the sky
and being with the ones I love.

22:04.240 --> 22:06.240
You know, that's the game I want to play.

22:06.720 --> 22:09.240
We got each other,
and that's all there is.

22:09.640 --> 22:12.560
- Well-- No, that's not all. That's great.
-

22:12.640 --> 22:14.920
It's wonderful.
Do I want to risk that again?

22:15.000 --> 22:16.760
Well, I don't know. I don't know.

22:17.120 --> 22:20.400
- I just can't lose you again.
- You're gonna make me cry.

22:20.480 --> 22:23.440
I'm sorry. But it's true.

22:23.640 --> 22:25.360
I feel like we just got you back.

22:25.440 --> 22:27.160
- I know.
- I can't--

22:27.240 --> 22:30.080
No, I don't want
to lose you guys again. No.

22:30.320 --> 22:33.440
I know, who would you have
to boss around, Dad?

22:33.560 --> 22:36.280
Oh, I was good in prison
at bossing people around.

23:47.560 --> 23:48.680
This is somebody else.

23:50.400 --> 23:51.560
That's theirs.

23:56.160 --> 23:58.360
I don't think Kathleen would like
all that noise.

24:01.040 --> 24:03.240
I can't explain life. I can't underst--

24:03.440 --> 24:05.800
I don't know what it's all about.

24:06.000 --> 24:09.880
We think we do, but I don't.
I have no idea what it's all about.

24:09.960 --> 24:13.520
If somebody had said, "Oh, little boy,"
when I was four or five,

24:13.680 --> 24:15.920
"these are the things
that are going to happen to you.

24:16.160 --> 24:18.920
You know, you're going to go to war,
you're going to have..."

24:19.080 --> 24:21.520
None of that, none of that
would make any sense.

24:21.640 --> 24:23.480
And it still doesn't make any sense.

24:23.560 --> 24:25.520
I don't know the meaning of life.

24:26.080 --> 24:30.560
Uh, so... I wouldn't call it nonsense,

24:30.640 --> 24:33.920
I would just say, "I just don't get it."

24:34.600 --> 24:37.120
And what happens seems to be,

24:37.360 --> 24:38.520
I don't know,

24:38.840 --> 24:41.480
random, this just happens.

24:41.560 --> 24:43.120
If I had known,

24:43.600 --> 24:47.400
"Oh! This is the last
I'm going to see her.

24:47.480 --> 24:50.280
She's gonna walk out of the pool
and she's gonna go there--"

24:50.400 --> 24:54.160
And if I knew
that was the last I would see her,

24:54.240 --> 24:56.320
well, I wouldn't have let her go.
I'd keep her.

24:56.440 --> 24:58.760
Or, you know, if I couldn't keep her,
I would say,

24:58.840 --> 25:01.280
"Oh, I love you." Oh, all these things.

25:02.840 --> 25:04.280
But that didn't happen.

25:04.720 --> 25:07.040
She just walked away and...

25:09.360 --> 25:10.880
That's pretty much what life is.

25:10.960 --> 25:13.560
It's just, things happen that you...

25:14.480 --> 25:17.720
A door closes, you walk away, and...
"Whoa!"

25:18.040 --> 25:23.240
And I get pretty emotional about that,
so that's why I don't like to go there.

25:23.320 --> 25:25.960
Like, what if I could have held her,

25:26.040 --> 25:28.280
and said, "Hey, honey, don't go out there.

25:28.560 --> 25:31.160
Don't-- Don't go in the house."

25:33.560 --> 25:35.000
I just, you know,

25:35.440 --> 25:38.120
didn't say that.
Didn't think anything would happen.

25:41.000 --> 25:43.240
So what are the next steps for...

25:43.400 --> 25:44.440
with Rudolf?

25:45.280 --> 25:48.480
David is going to contact Butch Williams,

25:48.560 --> 25:52.000
who was the guy who pinned that Marine
thing on-- He was a Marine and--

25:52.080 --> 25:53.480
Yeah. Was he sitting on our side?

25:53.560 --> 25:55.480
- Yeah, he was on our side. Oh, absolutely.
- Oh!

25:55.560 --> 25:57.960
Big black guy, wonderful.

25:58.040 --> 25:59.720
- He had a hat.
- Yeah, he was really cool.

25:59.800 --> 26:04.160
He's a good friend of Judge Hudson,
and of, I assume, Roger Echols, the DA,

26:05.400 --> 26:09.200
and David and Roger will go to them

26:09.320 --> 26:11.960
- and say, "Let's end this."
- Or Butch? OK.

26:12.080 --> 26:13.560
- You see.
- Yeah.

26:14.560 --> 26:15.400
I dunno.

26:16.400 --> 26:18.760
Do you feel relieved
after talking to David? Or do you--

26:18.840 --> 26:20.840
Oh, yeah! Oh, damn it, absolutely!

26:21.080 --> 26:23.160
- Absolutely! David's fantastic!
- Good.

26:23.880 --> 26:27.280
What do-- Do you think there's
any possibility of a retrial?

26:27.760 --> 26:29.840
- Well, yeah.
- Yeah.

26:30.120 --> 26:32.760
-
- But we just won't know until

26:32.840 --> 26:35.240
- things get--
- I can't imagine, but...

26:36.760 --> 26:39.360
- Who knows? Who knows?
- Yeah.

26:39.800 --> 26:41.200
- Hmm.
- No idea.

26:41.360 --> 26:43.440
- We're here.
- Not one thing has gone

26:43.520 --> 26:45.800
- the way I thought it would, so...
- Yeah.

26:47.200 --> 26:49.040
- Why make another prediction?
- Yeah.

26:49.120 --> 26:51.240
- Oh, God. Yeah.
- But I don't think so.

27:14.400 --> 27:16.000
Hello. David!

27:16.360 --> 27:18.120
Hey, Michael. How are you?

27:18.320 --> 27:20.160
OK, good. Good. You?

27:21.160 --> 27:22.280
I'm good, thank you.

27:22.400 --> 27:27.000
Uh, so, I got a call from Roger Echols,

27:27.680 --> 27:32.600
uh, who told me that they are now willing

27:32.760 --> 27:38.600
to offer the Alford plea
to the voluntary manslaughter. Um...

27:39.440 --> 27:41.080
And so, uh,

27:41.160 --> 27:43.560
I asked him to put that in writing,

27:43.720 --> 27:46.800
which he has now done
by sending me an email,

27:47.120 --> 27:51.680
uh, saying they would agree
to the Alford plea

27:52.360 --> 27:54.320
to voluntary manslaughter.

27:54.400 --> 27:55.600
So, um...

27:56.120 --> 27:58.120
we don't need to get back to them
right away,

27:58.200 --> 28:02.880
uh, but that is now on the table,

28:03.000 --> 28:07.680
and something for you to think about
and talk with your family about.

28:09.320 --> 28:10.520
Hmm. OK.

28:10.680 --> 28:13.200
Why the sudden offer, do you think?

28:13.480 --> 28:17.240
Well, it's hard to say,
because he didn't offer any explanation,

28:17.360 --> 28:21.840
but I suspect that the motions
that got filed,

28:21.960 --> 28:24.320
which sort of indicated to them

28:24.440 --> 28:29.640
that they were not gonna be able
to get into evidence

28:30.000 --> 28:33.200
much of what they previously
did get into evidence,

28:33.280 --> 28:36.440
as well as the conference we had
with Judge Hudson,

28:36.560 --> 28:41.560
in which he indicated
that he was reconsidering

28:41.680 --> 28:45.840
whether he should have ever allowed in
the Germany evidence,

28:45.960 --> 28:49.560
and also that he realized
that much of the evidence

28:49.640 --> 28:53.760
that came out of the search warrant would
have to be inadmissible at the new trial.

28:53.840 --> 28:56.920
I think both of those factors
probably played into it.

28:57.000 --> 28:58.560
Hmm. OK.

28:58.760 --> 29:02.400
Uh, I guess my question would be,
in light of your motions,

29:02.480 --> 29:04.600
in light of everything
that's been discovered,

29:05.040 --> 29:06.840
why would I take an Alford plea?

29:06.920 --> 29:10.000
Why not just push this through to the end?

29:10.560 --> 29:13.080
Well, uh, that's certainly your choice,

29:13.160 --> 29:16.520
but if you remember,
after you called me after that hearing,

29:16.720 --> 29:21.320
you indicated that your family
really wanted this to just end.

29:22.000 --> 29:23.680
Going through a whole nother trial

29:23.760 --> 29:27.920
is draining and difficult for your family.

29:28.000 --> 29:29.720
It'd be difficult for you.

29:30.080 --> 29:34.240
Given how the game was played
the first time,

29:34.360 --> 29:36.120
I'm not sure we could assume

29:36.200 --> 29:39.520
that the game would be played
any more fairly this time.

29:39.600 --> 29:40.560
Well, that's true.

29:42.200 --> 29:45.160
Mm, I don't know, David. It's--
It's tough.

29:45.240 --> 29:46.680
It really is, because...

29:48.440 --> 29:49.880
the Alford plea is--

29:50.040 --> 29:53.400
I know that's what we've been pushing for
from the beginning,

29:53.880 --> 29:56.040
uh, thinking it was the best we could do,

29:56.280 --> 30:00.840
and I guess I'm beginning to think
maybe we can do better.

30:01.520 --> 30:03.800
What do you think? Do you think that,
if pushed further,

30:03.880 --> 30:06.480
that DA Echols would eventually say,

30:06.760 --> 30:09.640
"There's nothing here.
We can't use any of these things,"

30:09.960 --> 30:11.960
which Judge Hudson's already hinted at,

30:12.400 --> 30:13.800
and then he would say, "OK.

30:14.320 --> 30:17.040
We'll dismiss it."
Do you think that's a possibility?

30:17.800 --> 30:19.960
- No. I don't.
- Oh.

30:20.080 --> 30:25.600
And the reason I don't is because
they have been sort of captives

30:25.680 --> 30:29.440
of Candace and Lori

30:29.560 --> 30:34.160
and to a lesser extent, I guess, Caitlin,
for the last 15 years.

30:34.240 --> 30:39.480
I don't think they're going to do anything
that Candace is going to complain about.

30:39.600 --> 30:45.400
They would rather lose a trial
than deal with Candace.

30:45.520 --> 30:48.480
So, I think it boils down to either

30:48.600 --> 30:51.480
you go to trial
or you take this Alford plea.

30:53.000 --> 30:55.200
OK. I understand.

30:55.280 --> 31:00.680
If there was some guarantee that
another trial would result

31:00.920 --> 31:02.160
in an acquittal,

31:02.440 --> 31:04.200
then it would be worth pushing on,

31:04.480 --> 31:07.880
but there is no guarantee of that, either.

31:08.160 --> 31:09.760
There's never a guarantee.

31:10.240 --> 31:13.360
It's not a great resolution for you,
it's not a perfect resolution,

31:13.440 --> 31:16.920
but at least it's over.
You can go on and live your life.

31:17.120 --> 31:21.440
So, think about it
and then let's talk some more.

31:21.520 --> 31:23.800
OK, I got it. I appreciate it. Uh...

31:24.960 --> 31:27.920
Yeah, thanks for your efforts.

31:28.080 --> 31:29.720
I got it. I'll, uh...

31:30.680 --> 31:34.280
I know this is what
I've been wanting, uh, but now...

31:35.840 --> 31:38.560
It's gonna be a tough decision to make.
It really will.

31:38.720 --> 31:41.080
I will get back to you
very shortly on this, OK?

31:41.960 --> 31:43.240
OK. Take care, Michael.

31:43.320 --> 31:45.080
OK. Thanks, David. Bye-bye.

32:00.960 --> 32:05.240
I guess this is the time you say, "Fuck!"
Right? Shit!

32:06.680 --> 32:09.520
But, you know...

32:11.040 --> 32:12.800
you don't always get what you want.

32:28.280 --> 32:29.240
I don't like this.

32:29.440 --> 32:33.200
I don't like it because they lied,
they cheated, they used...

32:33.960 --> 32:38.120
perjury, unconstitutional searches.
They did everything to convict me.

32:39.200 --> 32:41.360
And they did. And it was wrong.

32:42.320 --> 32:45.000
And I spent eight years in prison.

32:45.920 --> 32:49.240
And now I'm going to have to say,
or admit-- I'm not gonna admit it,

32:49.320 --> 32:50.440
'cause I told them that.

32:50.520 --> 32:54.440
Never, never, never would I admit
that I killed Kathleen,

32:54.680 --> 32:58.560
but the practical reality is
there was a manslaughter there,

32:59.400 --> 33:02.600
and that's wrong. It's just flat wrong.

33:02.840 --> 33:04.000
And that's why

33:05.120 --> 33:07.880
the depression went away
and the anger came in and said,

33:07.960 --> 33:09.880
"I don't like this. I don't like it."

33:10.760 --> 33:12.880
And then, "Well, why don't you fight it?"

33:12.960 --> 33:15.320
And then you start thinking about,
"Wait a minute.

33:15.720 --> 33:17.840
They lied, they cheated,
they used perjury,

33:18.400 --> 33:19.560
junk science,

33:19.800 --> 33:22.560
uh, false experiments,
unconstitutional searches,

33:22.760 --> 33:25.600
they brought in these people
from Germany who just flat lied.

33:25.680 --> 33:28.640
Candace lied, Lori lied,
perjured themselves on the stand.

33:28.720 --> 33:34.000
They went to all expense
and all effort to convict me.

33:35.760 --> 33:37.160
Would they do it again?

33:38.800 --> 33:40.120
Yeah, they might.

33:40.640 --> 33:42.480
Am I willing to risk that?

33:42.920 --> 33:47.640
Am I going to put my life and my freedom

33:47.720 --> 33:50.240
in the hands of these people
who did those things?

33:51.120 --> 33:53.400
And I realized,
"No. I'm not going to do it."

33:53.680 --> 33:57.120
So I told David,
"Hey. I've change my mind.

33:57.200 --> 34:01.720
I'll take the plea,
but it's not because I'm old,

34:01.800 --> 34:03.920
and it's not to spare my children,

34:04.000 --> 34:06.240
but because I don't trust the system.

34:07.400 --> 34:09.880
Well, I lose...

34:10.600 --> 34:14.400
because it's on my record.
But you know what? I really don't care.

34:15.080 --> 34:18.040
My kids are not going to lose,
because they don't care.

34:19.560 --> 34:22.400
So, while it's a bad deal,

34:23.239 --> 34:24.280
I can live with it.

34:25.159 --> 34:26.040
I hate it.

34:27.560 --> 34:30.520
A few days ago,
I was sitting there thinking to myself,

34:30.600 --> 34:34.360
"Maybe we should just
try this case again."

34:34.440 --> 34:35.960
Winning the case at trial,

34:36.159 --> 34:39.639
you know, that would,
from an ego perspective, I guess,

34:40.280 --> 34:41.880
be much more satisfying.

34:42.639 --> 34:45.280
But at the end of the day, um...

34:46.199 --> 34:48.280
the jury doesn't say, "Innocent."

34:49.520 --> 34:52.280
You know? The jury says, "Not guilty."

34:52.880 --> 34:55.600
The jury says,
"We have a reasonable doubt."

34:56.639 --> 35:00.080
What's the point of a trial at this time?

35:00.200 --> 35:01.720
What's the point of it?

35:02.920 --> 35:04.640
Assuming we win,

35:05.280 --> 35:07.720
what does that get us

35:08.120 --> 35:10.640
that this resolution doesn't?

35:12.320 --> 35:15.040
And so, the answer to that is...

35:16.000 --> 35:16.880
nothing.

35:19.000 --> 35:21.400
That's not something to be happy about.

35:21.800 --> 35:24.280
It's not something
to be enthusiastic about.

35:24.560 --> 35:27.560
It's something to just recognize
and to accept.

35:34.200 --> 35:37.640
-
- After the main subject, your age. Right.

35:38.400 --> 35:41.720
I'm the only one that got it right.
Verified by Cindy.

35:44.840 --> 35:46.600
- It's just copies.
- OK.

35:49.720 --> 35:53.320
- Where is the evil 13? All right.
- I'll show you.

35:53.520 --> 35:56.320
I don't want you to be shocked tomorrow
when I say, "No!"

35:57.280 --> 35:59.320
- It may create some issues, so--
- What?

35:59.520 --> 36:01.080
I said it may-- I don't know.

36:01.160 --> 36:02.680
- With Hudson?
- I don't know.

36:02.760 --> 36:05.200
- Well, it goddamned better not.
- Well, we'll see.

36:07.720 --> 36:09.680
Well, if he asks me, I'm saying no.

36:10.640 --> 36:13.280
You know, "Are you able to hear and
understand me?" and I put in "Yes."

36:13.360 --> 36:16.400
"Do understand you have the right to
remain silent, and any statement you make

36:16.480 --> 36:17.920
may be used against you?" "Yes."

36:18.000 --> 36:20.920
"Are you now under the influence of
alcohol, drugs, narcotics, medicines,

36:21.000 --> 36:23.440
pills, or any other substances?" "No."

36:24.520 --> 36:27.200
"When was the last time you used
or consumed any such substance?"

36:27.280 --> 36:32.040
I put "wine." I put, you know,
last Monday or so-- Whatever.

36:32.120 --> 36:33.280
- Right, right.
- Um...

36:33.360 --> 36:35.280
- I'm sure you've had wine.
- What about the cocaine?

36:35.360 --> 36:37.560
- Yeah, thanks. That was a joke.
-

36:40.600 --> 36:41.560
Um...

36:41.640 --> 36:44.000
"Are you satisfied with your
lawyer's legal services?"

36:44.080 --> 36:45.560
What did I answer to that?

36:45.640 --> 36:47.440
You'd better answer, "Very satisfied."

36:48.520 --> 36:51.640
"Extremely well satisfied." Um...

36:52.320 --> 36:55.360
"Do you understand you have the right
to plead not guilty

36:55.440 --> 36:56.760
and be tried by a jury?" "Yes."

36:56.840 --> 37:00.200
Here's the plea, that you're pleading to
voluntary manslaughter.

37:00.720 --> 37:04.440
- Mm-hmm.
- Total maximum punishment, 229 months.

37:04.840 --> 37:07.480
Mandatory minimum, 38 months.

37:08.000 --> 37:10.480
And then here's question 13,

37:10.560 --> 37:12.440
- which I left blank.
- Mm-hmm.

37:12.520 --> 37:16.920
"Do you now personally plead guilty or no
contest to the charge I just described?"

37:17.000 --> 37:18.800
I just put "NA," not applicable.

37:18.880 --> 37:19.880
- OK?
- Right.

37:19.960 --> 37:21.920
I don't know
what's gonna happen tomorrow.

37:22.000 --> 37:24.000
Would you talk to him beforehand,
and let him know,

37:24.160 --> 37:27.120
he doesn't-- Don't ask a question
he doesn't want to know the answer to,

37:27.200 --> 37:29.400
because if he asks me
am I going to plead guilty,

37:29.480 --> 37:30.800
the answer is no.

37:30.960 --> 37:32.320
OK. Well, hold on.

37:33.200 --> 37:36.080
Why can't you say,
"I am entering an Alford plea?"

37:36.160 --> 37:37.720
- I'm can say that.
- OK.

37:38.000 --> 37:40.000
- I'll say that.
- OK, well, don't say "no."

37:40.080 --> 37:42.520
Just say, "I'm entering an Alford plea."

37:42.720 --> 37:43.880
- All right.
- And then,

37:44.120 --> 37:46.560
he can say, "Do you understand that
that's the equivalent

37:46.640 --> 37:47.960
- of a guilty plea?"
- That's fine.

37:48.040 --> 37:51.160
As long as the word "guilty"
doesn't have to come out of my mouth...

37:51.600 --> 37:53.600
Got it. "I am entering an Alford plea."

37:53.680 --> 37:56.640
So, when he says, "Do you now
personally plead guilty?" you say,

37:56.720 --> 37:59.800
"Your Honor, I am entering an Alford plea
at this time."

37:59.880 --> 38:03.200
- OK.
- And then, I'm gonna ask him to say,

38:03.600 --> 38:06.520
"Do you understand that
that's the equivalent of a..."

38:06.720 --> 38:11.320
- Which is number D or something.
- Exactly. You can say, "Your Honor,

38:11.400 --> 38:14.040
I'm entering an Alford guilty plea."

38:14.800 --> 38:17.480
- I'm just saying, "Alford plea."
- "Alford plea"? OK. Fair enough.

38:17.560 --> 38:20.320
- I don't want that word out of my mouth.
- I understand.

38:20.520 --> 38:21.520
All right.

38:21.600 --> 38:25.400
"Do you now consider it to be
in your best interest to plead guilty

38:25.680 --> 38:27.720
to the charge I just described?"

38:28.280 --> 38:30.920
- "Yes." 14 C.
- What? What is that one?

38:31.000 --> 38:34.080
"Do you now consider it
to your interest to plead guilty...

38:34.640 --> 38:35.520
Alford plea."

38:35.680 --> 38:37.640
Oh shit!
Well, I have to answer that one, right?

38:37.720 --> 38:39.800
Well, you have to. I mean, it's there.

38:39.880 --> 38:41.680
- All right. I understand that.
- OK.

38:41.760 --> 38:43.840
So, we'll go over this with the judge

38:43.920 --> 38:45.400
- and Dornfried before--
- All right.

38:45.480 --> 38:48.160
Right, beforehand,
so everybody understands.

38:48.240 --> 38:49.600
- All right.
- Yep.

38:49.680 --> 38:51.760
- All right? Yeah.
- We all get it, but...

38:52.000 --> 38:53.240
Yeah, I understand.

38:53.480 --> 38:57.880
Proving what actually happened
is often impossible,

38:58.240 --> 39:00.960
so the best you can do is show

39:01.320 --> 39:04.520
that there's a reasonable doubt
about a person's guilt.

39:05.040 --> 39:07.480
It's rare that you could
prove somebody innocent.

39:08.720 --> 39:10.920
Sure, I want to know,
because it's a mystery,

39:11.000 --> 39:14.320
and we all want to know
how the mystery ends.

39:14.600 --> 39:15.880
What happened?

39:16.880 --> 39:21.680
I can completely understand Michael's
view of that, which is,

39:22.320 --> 39:27.280
"Hey, I lost the person in my life
who I loved the most,

39:28.040 --> 39:31.320
and that's the only thing that really
matters at the end of the day."

39:31.840 --> 39:35.640
But for the rest of us who are just
observers, who are not participants,

39:36.040 --> 39:37.920
we want to know what happened.

39:38.280 --> 39:42.200
If you ask me,
"What's the most likely scenario?"

39:42.600 --> 39:43.760
I'd say it's a fall.

39:44.000 --> 39:46.960
Can I rule out that it was an intruder?

39:47.720 --> 39:50.160
I can't. No one can.

39:50.720 --> 39:52.840
You can say there's no evidence of that.

39:54.040 --> 39:59.800
But it's well known that the absence
of evidence is not evidence of absence.

40:00.240 --> 40:01.920
So, we don't know.

40:03.000 --> 40:07.520
Can I say a hundred percent that it
wasn't some raptor who flew down

40:07.600 --> 40:10.040
and inflicted those scalp wounds

40:10.600 --> 40:14.320
without causing a skull fracture
or any brain injury?

40:14.400 --> 40:16.160
I can't say one way or the other.

40:21.960 --> 40:23.160
What to do?

40:24.560 --> 40:26.840
Oh, honey. Oh, no.

40:26.920 --> 40:28.080
Hello?

40:36.360 --> 40:37.440
Oh, God.

40:44.720 --> 40:46.560
Uh, from that moment, it's...

40:48.640 --> 40:50.000
it's really...

40:51.120 --> 40:53.480
hard because there was just blood.

40:54.400 --> 40:55.640
But I couldn't...

40:56.920 --> 40:59.680
I don't think I focused so much
on the blood.

41:00.160 --> 41:02.880
Certainly, at first,
the fact that she's lying there,

41:03.480 --> 41:06.240
uh, and I went and grabbed her,

41:06.640 --> 41:09.240
saw her and... uh...

41:11.000 --> 41:13.000
it was just...

41:17.480 --> 41:20.240
That was worse
than anything that I ever

41:20.840 --> 41:22.240
saw or did in war.

41:22.760 --> 41:26.720
And then I ran up and got some towels
to put under her head and whatnot.

41:27.320 --> 41:28.320
Uh...

41:29.160 --> 41:31.720
Called 911 or maybe I called 911 first.

41:31.800 --> 41:33.840
I'm sure I called 911 first,

41:34.400 --> 41:37.800
and said that
she's fallen down the stairs. Uh...

41:38.920 --> 41:40.400
Which is what I believed.

41:40.520 --> 41:43.040
She's at the bottom of the stairs.
Well, she fell.

41:43.160 --> 41:44.360
Uh...

41:45.360 --> 41:47.960
It was just this...

41:50.760 --> 41:54.320
I mean, it's such a cliche,
it's almost a euphemism.

41:54.400 --> 41:57.960
I was in shock. I was in shock.

41:58.320 --> 42:01.080
I just couldn't believe it.
We had just talked, we just...

42:01.440 --> 42:02.440
It was...

42:06.720 --> 42:10.040
No, it was much worse than war,
because in war, you expect things.

42:10.440 --> 42:13.400
I mean, I can remember,
during the Tet Offensive, you know?

42:13.720 --> 42:16.040
Terrible things happ--
Terrible things happened.

42:16.720 --> 42:19.120
But you expect terrible things
to happen in war.

42:19.200 --> 42:20.360
You're ready for that.

42:20.440 --> 42:23.280
You don't want it to happen.
When it happens, it's a shock,

42:23.440 --> 42:25.920
but nothing like this.

42:26.520 --> 42:27.560
Uh...

42:28.040 --> 42:32.000
Someone that you love,
you were just with, you know, they're...

42:32.240 --> 42:33.240
They're there.

42:33.480 --> 42:36.560
And she was dying. I knew that.
I could just tell that right away.

42:38.520 --> 42:43.000
And then I just don't really remember.

42:44.040 --> 42:46.640
I mean, I just remember activity.

42:46.720 --> 42:52.400
Sort of this white noise or white action
that's going on in back of--

42:52.560 --> 42:54.880
You know, people coming and going and...

42:55.040 --> 42:56.280
Uh...

42:57.840 --> 43:00.040
I don't know.
I guess it's the first time...

43:01.520 --> 43:02.680
maybe the only time...

43:04.520 --> 43:06.120
I guess it is the only time

43:06.400 --> 43:08.280
I've ever been just totally shocked

43:08.600 --> 43:10.600
and just not really...

43:13.520 --> 43:14.360
there.

43:14.600 --> 43:17.000
I mean, I went through
some terrible things in war,

43:17.320 --> 43:20.000
but you're trained for that.

43:20.080 --> 43:22.080
You know, you'd better call in
the artillery,

43:22.160 --> 43:24.840
you'd better call in a medivac,
you'd better do these things.

43:24.920 --> 43:28.760
You know,
you're trained to do these things because

43:29.960 --> 43:31.440
you know they can happen.

43:33.320 --> 43:36.200
But this was something that's just...

43:37.880 --> 43:39.600
I don't know. I mean, I was just,

43:40.240 --> 43:42.000
you know, nobody trains you for that.

43:42.120 --> 43:45.160
And I didn't, I didn't know what to do

43:45.240 --> 43:49.040
except call 911 and, thank God,

43:49.720 --> 43:52.000
uh, you know, Todd and, uh...

43:53.240 --> 43:55.000
What was her name? Lovely girl.

43:56.160 --> 43:59.320
Came within literally three
or four minutes.

43:59.600 --> 44:01.040
And, uh...

44:01.600 --> 44:04.640
And then after that it was just...
it was just crazy.

44:05.000 --> 44:09.360
So, that's all I can say.
I just remember being...

44:12.640 --> 44:14.920
I guess for the first time
in my life, just...

44:16.400 --> 44:17.920
totally, completely...

44:20.000 --> 44:21.720
overwhelmed, just shut down.

44:21.800 --> 44:23.000
This is not...

44:24.120 --> 44:25.240
It just wasn't...

44:31.960 --> 44:34.960
It just wasn't right. It just couldn't be.

44:35.840 --> 44:36.920
But it was.

44:38.000 --> 44:42.360
So, that's the best I can do,
is to tell you

44:43.200 --> 44:45.240
I saw her and...

44:47.440 --> 44:50.040
...I wasn't ready for that.

44:51.400 --> 44:52.280
At all.
