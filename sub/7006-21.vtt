00:01.468 --> 00:03.732
Thank you for putting
this food on our table.

00:03.803 --> 00:06.704
Most of all, for allowing us
to share this time together.

00:06.773 --> 00:07.933
- Amen.
- [all] Amen.

00:08.041 --> 00:09.941
- l'll turn on the TV.
- Turn it up loud.

00:10.010 --> 00:13.468
Freeze! Nobody's watching any TV
during dinner tonight. Sit down.

00:13.546 --> 00:16.572
We are going to spend 20 minutes
just talking to each other.

00:16.649 --> 00:19.379
Twenty consecutive minutes?

00:19.452 --> 00:21.716
We're having a peaceful
dinner together.

00:21.788 --> 00:25.952
- With no telephone and no TV.
- What about watching...

00:26.026 --> 00:28.551
Those are the rules,
effective immediately.

00:28.628 --> 00:30.289
Bulls are playing the Pistons.

00:30.363 --> 00:33.992
Effective immediately starting
tomorrow night.

00:35.602 --> 00:37.968
Forget it. Brad,
put your napkin in your lap.

00:38.038 --> 00:40.768
Pass the meat.
Don't stick your finger in the gravy.

00:40.840 --> 00:44.332
Let's go around the table
and find out how everybody's doing.

00:44.411 --> 00:48.245
- Put something green on your plate.
- l did. lt's the meatloaf.

00:49.149 --> 00:51.811
Very funny. Now, Brad,
what's going on with you?

00:51.885 --> 00:53.910
- Nothing.
- Randy?

00:53.987 --> 00:56.148
- Nothing.
- [Jill] Mark?

00:56.222 --> 00:58.281
l could use
some more spending money.

00:58.358 --> 01:00.019
Forget about it, please.

01:00.093 --> 01:03.028
Guys, come on, there must be
something you want to share,

01:03.096 --> 01:05.063
something you're looking forward to.

01:05.165 --> 01:08.032
l'm looking forward to
the air show next Sunday.

01:08.101 --> 01:10.035
Nothing better than a father and son

01:10.103 --> 01:13.937
sucking on corn dogs and
breathing toxic jet fumes. Yeah!

01:14.974 --> 01:17.909
Gosh, Dad, you make it
sound so appealing.

01:17.977 --> 01:19.535
Don't knock it.

01:19.646 --> 01:21.978
Your father and Mark
look forward every year

01:22.048 --> 01:24.482
to sucking up
those toxic fumes together.

01:24.918 --> 01:27.079
This year the Blue Angels
are performing.

01:27.153 --> 01:30.520
You guys remember when they let me
ride in the back of the airplane?

01:30.623 --> 01:33.888
Yeah, they'll never forget it.
They spent a week hosing it out.

01:36.596 --> 01:38.359
You know what l read this year?

01:38.465 --> 01:41.559
They're going to bring an
F-1 1 7 to simulate a bomb run.

01:41.634 --> 01:44.194
Are they dropping the
Mark 54s or the Mavericks?

01:44.270 --> 01:45.999
- Both.
- Alright.

01:46.072 --> 01:47.903
lsn't this great?

01:47.974 --> 01:51.466
Having a conversation
just like a family.

01:52.979 --> 01:56.437
Yeah, nothing brings a family together
like bomb talk.

01:58.818 --> 02:00.649

02:46.366 --> 02:48.300
Tim! Tim, big news.

02:48.368 --> 02:51.030
Your mom's bunions
are inflamed again?

02:51.271 --> 02:54.172
Yes, but that's not
what l was going to tell you.

02:54.240 --> 02:57.676
We just got a call from
the National Homebuilders Society.

02:57.744 --> 03:00.406
l paid that fine.

03:00.813 --> 03:02.940
That's not why
they want to talk to you.

03:03.016 --> 03:04.779
You know that award that they give?

03:04.884 --> 03:07.580
Consecutive appearances
on a home renovation show.

03:07.654 --> 03:10.214
- Bob Vila's held that for years.
- Not anymore.

03:10.323 --> 03:14.350
Tomorrow you, Tim Taylor,
become the new tool show king!

03:14.427 --> 03:15.985
- No! Me?
- Yes. Yes!

03:16.062 --> 03:17.552
- Serious? You sure?
- Yes!

03:17.630 --> 03:19.257
- Get out!
- No!

03:20.733 --> 03:22.257
Wow, Al!

03:22.335 --> 03:25.668
Never in my wildest dreams
did l believe l could break his record.

03:25.738 --> 03:27.171
- l believed in you.
- Yeah?

03:27.240 --> 03:30.607
Oh, yeah. The minute l met you,
l knew you could break anything.

03:36.316 --> 03:37.749
<i>Welcome back to Tool Time.</i>

03:37.817 --> 03:40.980
Today we're going to talk about
vises in the workshop.

03:41.054 --> 03:45.081
Simple. Just don't drink or gamble
when you use the bench grinder.

03:47.293 --> 03:49.523
We're talking about bench vises.

03:49.596 --> 03:52.064
Before we get to that,
l have a big announcement.

03:52.131 --> 03:54.565
On tomorrow's show,
l will break the record

03:54.634 --> 03:58.730
for consecutive appearances on a home
remodeling show. How about that, huh?

03:58.805 --> 04:00.033
[audience cheers]

04:01.140 --> 04:05.042
Well, l thought we were going
to wait till the end of the show

04:05.111 --> 04:08.080
to surprise our audience
with this information.

04:08.147 --> 04:10.479
But since Tim can't wait,

04:10.550 --> 04:14.509
<i>Heidi and l have a little Tool Time
surprise for you. Klaus?</i>

04:14.954 --> 04:17.387
[band plays music]

04:18.190 --> 04:20.317
[audience laughs]

04:21.060 --> 04:22.823
l love surprises.

04:22.929 --> 04:26.092
Well, Tim, we've arranged
for you to go

04:26.199 --> 04:28.167
to a beautiful home
in downtown Wixom,

04:28.268 --> 04:32.295
where we will be asphalting a driveway!

04:32.572 --> 04:35.132
Oh, l love asphalt.

04:35.241 --> 04:38.301
But wait. There's more.
Heidi, come on down.

04:38.378 --> 04:40.346
And to lay that asphalt,

04:40.413 --> 04:44.509
you'll be riding this big,
beautiful five-ton steamroller.

04:44.584 --> 04:46.609
[audience] Ooh!

04:48.621 --> 04:51.715
- Don't toy with me.
- This roller is no toy.

04:51.791 --> 04:54.225
lt's got a 41 -horsepower
diesel engine,

04:54.294 --> 04:56.023
hydrostatic transmission,

04:56.095 --> 05:00.225
and a top cruising speed
of five miles an hour.

05:02.201 --> 05:04.226
And this is all for...

05:04.304 --> 05:07.967
[Heidi and audience chanting]
Tim, Tim, Tim.

05:08.041 --> 05:11.067
[Al] That's right.
This is all for Tim Taylor,

05:11.144 --> 05:15.672
the king... of... tool shows!

05:20.019 --> 05:22.783
l'd like to thank everyone
for this award.

05:22.889 --> 05:26.052
Especially Al and Heidi and l...

05:26.693 --> 05:28.786
- [woman screams]
- Whoa!

05:29.729 --> 05:32.357
- Oh!
- Are you alright?

05:32.899 --> 05:35.800
l usually scream when l'm alright.
No, l'm not all right!

05:36.869 --> 05:41.238
The X-ray shows a grade three
achromio-clavicular separation.

05:41.307 --> 05:43.741
Give it to me straight, Doc.
How long do l got?

05:43.810 --> 05:47.371
Fifty, sixty years, tops.

05:47.447 --> 05:51.213
You separated your shoulder.
lt can easily be corrected with surgery.

05:51.284 --> 05:54.720
- Oh, honey. Are you in a lot of pain?
- Probably.

05:57.990 --> 06:01.153
l'll let you know after
those big blue pills wear off.

06:02.428 --> 06:06.194
- How long does he have to be here?
- Operate today, keep him here tomorrow,

06:06.265 --> 06:08.631
- go home Saturday morning.
- Saturday... oh!

06:08.701 --> 06:11.534
- He's has an air show to go to Sunday.
- Can l go to?

06:11.604 --> 06:14.767
lf you rest up and, uh,
you don't try to pick up a plane.

06:14.841 --> 06:16.604
Good, that's great.

06:16.676 --> 06:19.907
- Alright, then.
- Wait a minute.

06:21.881 --> 06:25.373
[exhales] There's a little problem
with me staying here tomorrow.

06:25.451 --> 06:27.612
- What's that?
- No can do.

06:27.687 --> 06:30.247
<i>l'm breaking Vila's record
on Tool Time tomorrow.</i>

06:30.323 --> 06:32.951
<i>What's Tool Time?</i>

06:35.962 --> 06:38.430
Now you'll tell me
you don't know who Bob Vila is.

06:38.498 --> 06:41.331
No, l know who Bob Vila is.

06:41.968 --> 06:46.098
lt's just a stupid record. The permanent
use of your arms is more important.

06:46.172 --> 06:49.300
- There's a solution here. l've got it.
- Listen to the doctor.

06:49.375 --> 06:51.138
<i>No, we'll just do Tool Time here.</i>

06:51.210 --> 06:54.702
Bring the steamroller here.
Your wheelchair ramps need repaving.

06:54.781 --> 06:58.148
- You can't work the day after surgery.
- lt's out of the question.

06:58.217 --> 07:01.550
How can you even think of doing
a TV show when you're injured?

07:01.621 --> 07:04.089
You really haven't seen his show.

07:07.927 --> 07:10.487
[Doctor] lt'll be a minute
before we put you under.

07:10.596 --> 07:12.962
You should feel relaxed
from the sedative.

07:13.032 --> 07:16.297
l feel like a million bucks.

07:16.569 --> 07:20.061
[man] Poor Tool Man. Damn shame
he couldn't break Bob Vila's record.

07:20.139 --> 07:23.836
Record... he can't even sing.
He's got no record.

07:24.076 --> 07:26.408
- He's ready for the anesthetic.
- Tim...

07:26.479 --> 07:28.743
...l want you to start
counting down from 1 00

07:28.815 --> 07:30.715
One hundred...

07:30.783 --> 07:33.274
- [machines beeping]
- ...ninety-nine...

07:33.352 --> 07:34.819
...ninety-eight...

07:35.321 --> 07:37.881
On behalf of the
National Homebuilders Society,

07:37.990 --> 07:40.356
it's my great pleasure
to present this award

07:40.460 --> 07:43.520
to the greatest tool man
who ever lived.

07:43.596 --> 07:46.087
You are the tool king.

07:46.165 --> 07:49.498
Congratulations, Mr. Vila.

07:53.339 --> 07:56.274
...And you're the prettiest nurse
in Dialysis, Becky...

07:56.342 --> 07:58.105
No, l mean it.

07:58.211 --> 08:01.442
l'll see you Saturday night.
Yeah, love you.

08:01.514 --> 08:04.574
- [imitates machine beep]
- [Doctor] l gotta go.

08:12.758 --> 08:14.726
- Gotcha, huh?
- Yeah.

08:14.827 --> 08:17.193
So, how are you
feeling this afternoon?

08:17.263 --> 08:19.561
You know, l am feeling just fine.

08:19.632 --> 08:21.862
As a matter of fact,
why don't l just get up?

08:21.934 --> 08:25.495
- [groans]
- Mr. Taylor, you can't go to work.

08:25.571 --> 08:29.007
You need to rest.
l'll be back to check on you later.

08:31.744 --> 08:35.475
<i>[Tim thinking] I don't need rest.
I feel great. I'm the Tool Man.</i>

08:35.548 --> 08:37.640
<i>A separated shoulder shouldn't stop me.</i>

08:37.717 --> 08:41.676
<i>Heck, I once did a show with
three broken ribs and my hair on fire!</i>

08:46.359 --> 08:49.920
<i>Well, that was easy.
Now, I'll just go to the location,</i>

08:50.029 --> 08:52.589
<i>break Villa's record
and come right back.</i>

09:02.775 --> 09:04.208
[screams]

09:05.111 --> 09:08.080
<i>Mental note, lifting is bad.</i>

09:26.866 --> 09:30.393
<i>Mental note, next time wear sandals.</i>

09:48.688 --> 09:51.179
[imitates woman] H-H-Hi.

09:51.257 --> 09:53.919
Could you please page Dr. Knell?

09:53.993 --> 09:57.759
Tell him that Becky wants
to see him in Dialysis.

10:00.299 --> 10:03.757
Yeah. l've got some sort of cold, yes.
Thank you. Bye-bye.

10:05.771 --> 10:09.673
<i>[woman on P.A.] Dr. Knell, report to
Becky in Dialysis immediately.</i>

10:30.930 --> 10:32.659
[woman screams]

10:33.332 --> 10:35.493
Enjoy your sponge bath, ma'am.

10:41.807 --> 10:44.867
Brad, Randy, Mark, we're heading
to the hospital to see Dad.

10:44.944 --> 10:47.208
l'll bring his Blue
Angels sweatshirt.

10:47.279 --> 10:49.247
Something he has to pull over his head.

10:49.348 --> 10:52.374
Thoughtful gift for a guy
who just had shoulder surgery.

10:52.451 --> 10:53.918
l'll help him put it on.

10:53.986 --> 10:56.011
l'm calling him,
tell him we're coming.

10:56.088 --> 11:00.582
lnstead of those boring family dinners,
we can all get together and dress Dad.

11:04.697 --> 11:07.791
- Yeah! And tomorrow, the family bath.
- There we go!

11:09.602 --> 11:13.060
Very funny. There's no answer.

11:13.139 --> 11:17.473
He was pretty wiped out after the
surgery. He's probably still sleeping.

11:17.543 --> 11:20.444
Let's go wake him up as a family.

11:22.782 --> 11:24.443
<i>Welcome back to Tool Time.</i>

11:24.517 --> 11:28.078
We're on location at the Phelps home
putting in an asphalt driveway.

11:28.154 --> 11:30.247
Our loop man has spread the asphalt,

11:30.322 --> 11:34.349
which is at the proper temperature
for smoothing, 370 degrees.

11:34.427 --> 11:36.122
We've ironed out the edges of...

11:36.195 --> 11:39.722
- Hi, Al. Hi, Heidi.
- Hi.

11:39.799 --> 11:42.063
Hi, Gary.

11:42.134 --> 11:46.400
This is Gary Phelps.
He is the little tyke that lives here.

11:46.472 --> 11:47.803
Where's the Tool Man?

11:47.873 --> 11:50.535
Well, as l already
explained to our audience,

11:50.609 --> 11:53.100
he's in the hospital with a boo-boo.

11:53.179 --> 11:55.409
A boo-boo?

11:55.481 --> 11:58.245
What do l look like?
A three-year-old?

12:00.553 --> 12:02.578
He wasn't released.
Nobody's seen him.

12:02.655 --> 12:05.715
Maybe we should check the psycho ward.

12:06.425 --> 12:08.916
That was the first place l looked.

12:09.829 --> 12:12.389
The suitcase is here,
but there's no clothes in it.

12:12.465 --> 12:15.491
So... he got dressed and left, and...

12:15.568 --> 12:17.832
...oh, no.

12:19.205 --> 12:21.366
<i>[Al] OK, we're ready for our final step.</i>

12:21.440 --> 12:25.604
We'll be using this steamroller
to smooth out our asphalt.

12:25.711 --> 12:27.679
You want to be careful when using...

12:27.780 --> 12:30.943
Thank you. Thanks, thanks.
Guys! Wait, wait, wait!

12:31.016 --> 12:33.348
Hi, everybody!

12:33.419 --> 12:35.148
- What are you doing?
- l made it!

12:35.221 --> 12:37.985
l made it! l made it! l made it!
[stammers] Which means,

12:38.057 --> 12:41.151
- l beat Bob Vila's record!
- [cheering]

12:42.561 --> 12:47.464
Um... and on this auspicious occasion
l'd like to say to Mr. Bob Vila...

12:48.367 --> 12:51.268
...[taunting, repeating]
Nanner-nanner-nanner.

12:51.337 --> 12:53.567
Tim, shouldn't you be in the hospital?

12:53.639 --> 12:55.607
Yes, he should.

12:55.674 --> 12:59.166
This is one good-looking steamroller.

12:59.245 --> 13:01.805
l think it actually looks
better in person.

13:01.914 --> 13:04.883
- He wouldn't.
- He couldn't.

13:04.950 --> 13:06.713
He's Dad.

13:08.053 --> 13:09.987
lt looks like it's
all ready to go, Al.

13:10.055 --> 13:12.990
With your shoulder,
l don't think you should drive this.

13:13.058 --> 13:15.618
This is my record-breaking show, Al.
Come on!

13:15.694 --> 13:18.857
l'm serious. You shouldn't be
anywhere near this machine.

13:18.931 --> 13:20.899
Well, let's ask the guy in charge, OK?

13:21.000 --> 13:24.436
Tim, what do you think we oughta do?
l say go for it.

13:25.905 --> 13:29.363
<i>- ls it over yet?
- [Tim] Remove this cumbersome thing.</i>

13:29.441 --> 13:32.410
- [engine starts]
- Be careful with the control lever.

13:32.511 --> 13:35.571
- This control lever here?
- Yes, it's very very sensitive.

13:35.648 --> 13:37.878
Don't go too fast
and crash into the garage.

13:37.950 --> 13:41.044
l can't stop! Look out!
We're gonna hit the garage door! Ahh!

13:44.089 --> 13:46.819
What do you know, he didn't crash.

13:46.892 --> 13:48.985
No. And he didn't break anything.

13:49.061 --> 13:51.495
Except Bob Vila's record!

13:51.564 --> 13:53.327
[crew cheers]

13:53.399 --> 13:55.959
Alright. Well, congratulations, Tim.

13:56.068 --> 13:58.593
Now, why don't you get down so l can
finish the job?

13:58.671 --> 14:01.401
l'll just back it
back into position for you.

14:01.473 --> 14:03.236
- Alright.
- [steamroller beeps]

14:07.546 --> 14:09.104
[crunching]

14:12.284 --> 14:14.445
[crying]

14:15.387 --> 14:17.355
l hear a little boy crying.

14:17.456 --> 14:20.789
Please tell me
he didn't run over the little boy.

14:20.860 --> 14:25.160
You smooshed my car,
you big stupidhead.

14:25.231 --> 14:27.597
lt's gonna be all right, kid.
Look. Well...

14:27.666 --> 14:29.224
- [crying]
- lt's alright.

14:29.301 --> 14:31.861
Hey, l'll get you another one...
a better one.

14:31.971 --> 14:34.701
[sniffles] That was my favorite car.

14:34.773 --> 14:38.607
Come on! Come on, hey! We're on TV.
And nobody likes a crybaby, right?

14:38.677 --> 14:42.443
You know, it's situations like
this that tend to make a kid stronger.

14:42.548 --> 14:46.109
l remember a slogan, ''lnto everyone's
life some rain must fall.''

14:46.185 --> 14:48.085
Right, folks? Right?

14:49.121 --> 14:52.056
Boy, that's a big shadow!
ls your Dad home?

14:53.259 --> 14:55.887
ls he standing right behind me?

14:56.562 --> 14:58.928
He's a big man, isn't he?

14:59.031 --> 15:01.192
ls he smiling?

15:04.870 --> 15:08.533
There's an old saying. ''ln everyone's
life, a little rain must fall.''

15:08.607 --> 15:11.098
Well, l hope you got
a big umbrella, buddy.

15:11.577 --> 15:13.010
[groans]

15:13.078 --> 15:15.342
Looks like Dad's
putting on his own air show.

15:15.814 --> 15:18.248
[groaning]

15:18.317 --> 15:21.150
- [Tim screaming]
- [thud]

15:21.587 --> 15:23.020
[ambulance siren]

15:23.622 --> 15:27.183
This next surgery should go very well.

15:27.259 --> 15:29.625
Now l know my way around.

15:31.263 --> 15:33.128
Can l go to the air show on Sunday?

15:33.198 --> 15:35.689
No. l'm afraid you
need to stay in the hospital.

15:35.768 --> 15:40.262
Don't worry. We're stationing our top
security guard right outside the door.

15:41.206 --> 15:43.367
- Man!
- Mark, l'm really sorry, buddy.

15:43.475 --> 15:44.601
l really am.

15:44.677 --> 15:46.702
Hey, l'll take you to the air show.

15:46.779 --> 15:49.873
Forget it. l only wanted to go with Dad.

15:49.949 --> 15:53.385
- Wait a second. Mark...
- Mark, he's trying to apologize to you.

15:53.452 --> 15:55.317
Too late.

15:58.023 --> 16:01.049
Brad, Randy... l gotta talk to your dad.

16:04.029 --> 16:05.462
How could you?

16:06.999 --> 16:08.967
That award was very important to me.

16:09.034 --> 16:11.594
Evidently it's more important
than your son.

16:11.670 --> 16:12.830
No, it's not.

16:12.905 --> 16:15.874
This is the one thing
you and Mark do together every year.

16:15.975 --> 16:20.309
l know. l don't know what came over me,
it's the medication, l think.

16:23.315 --> 16:25.408
l heard voices.

16:28.087 --> 16:32.046
One of them said,
''Go. You know, beat that record.''

16:32.791 --> 16:35.419
And the other one said,
''Don't forget your pants.''

16:37.629 --> 16:40.598
Well, here's a third voice for you,
''You let down your son,

16:40.699 --> 16:42.997
and he's completely devastated.''

16:44.303 --> 16:47.204
This day couldn't get any worse.

16:47.272 --> 16:49.137
Ready for your enema?

16:56.648 --> 17:00.175
l'm having shoulder surgery.
ls that really necessary?

17:00.986 --> 17:03.454
No, but l'm trying to break
Dr. Sokel's record

17:03.522 --> 17:06.888
for the most consecutive enemas
in one day.

17:08.292 --> 17:10.522
l'm kidding!

17:10.596 --> 17:12.154
l forgot my chart.

17:16.835 --> 17:18.530
He's ready for the anesthetic.

17:18.604 --> 17:20.902
Tim, start counting down from 1 00.

17:20.973 --> 17:24.032
[mumbling] Right...
let's see... one hundred...

17:25.711 --> 17:27.770
...ninety-nine...

17:27.846 --> 17:29.609
...ninety-eight...

17:29.715 --> 17:32.980
Well, hi-ho, good patient.

17:35.988 --> 17:37.455
- Hi, Wilson.
- [Wilson] Hi.

17:37.523 --> 17:41.357
- l didn't know you were a surgeon.
- l'm not. l volunteer at the gift shop.

17:41.427 --> 17:44.157
But, today they're letting me cut!

17:45.597 --> 17:49.363
So, what are we working on today?
Gall bladder, circumcision?

17:50.035 --> 17:53.163
Oh, no, no. lt's a shoulder...
a shoulder problem.

17:53.238 --> 17:55.672
Probably could use
a new brain though today.

17:55.741 --> 17:59.507
A brain transplant?
Oh, boy! That sounds like fun!

18:00.612 --> 18:04.309
l was supposed to take Mark
to the air show tomorrow.

18:04.383 --> 18:06.351
- l disappointed him.
- [Wilson] Mmm.

18:06.418 --> 18:09.444
Thinking about myself.
l always think about myself.

18:09.521 --> 18:12.046
That is exactly who
you should be thinking about.

18:12.124 --> 18:15.218
Look out for number one,
l always say.

18:15.294 --> 18:18.627
- You never say that.
- l've never done brain surgery either.

18:18.697 --> 18:20.756
[laughs]

18:20.833 --> 18:24.291
Wait a minute. This is a dream.
That's what this is.

18:24.369 --> 18:26.837
Silly me. But, what am
l gonna do about Mark?

18:26.905 --> 18:29.066
l don't know,
figure out something quick

18:29.141 --> 18:32.907
because by the time l'm done, odds are
you're not gonna know who Mark is!

18:33.011 --> 18:34.672
[cry of agony]

18:34.746 --> 18:38.204
Oh, Tim, relax.
lt isn't like it's brain surgery.

18:38.283 --> 18:41.343
Wait a second! lt is!

18:41.420 --> 18:43.183
[maniacal laughter]

18:44.723 --> 18:47.021
<i>- [doorbell rings]
- Mark, will you get that?</i>

18:47.092 --> 18:49.993
Why not? l got nothing better
to do this weekend.

18:52.531 --> 18:54.396
l'm looking for Mark Taylor.

18:54.466 --> 18:58.129
Lieutenant Commander Gray, number
three pilot, U.S. Navy Blue Angels.

18:58.203 --> 19:01.366
Ohh... um... l'm Mark Taylor.

19:01.440 --> 19:04.773
Hey, Mom. There's a Blue Angel
at the door.

19:07.079 --> 19:10.412
Oh, yeah, sure. And the
tooth fairy's in the microwave.

19:12.117 --> 19:15.280
- Can l help you?
- Mrs. Taylor, Lt. Commander Gray.

19:15.354 --> 19:18.448
- Your husband asked me to stop by.
- Please come in.

19:18.524 --> 19:21.186
Brad and Randy,
it's Lieutenant Commander Gray.

19:21.260 --> 19:23.387
- Brad. Randy.
- Nice to meet you.

19:23.462 --> 19:27.091
Tim called and said he was sorry
he couldn't take Mark to the air show.

19:27.166 --> 19:29.794
But l thought maybe he'd like
to come as our guest.

19:29.868 --> 19:33.360
- Well, what do you think about that?
- This is amazing!

19:33.438 --> 19:37.272
- Your Dad's a pretty amazing guy.
- Yeah. We're very fond of the Tool Man.

19:37.342 --> 19:40.778
Especially when he's, uh...
nowhere near our aircraft.

19:44.750 --> 19:47.116
Cool. You get to
hang out with the Blue Angels.

19:47.219 --> 19:48.686
l just thought of something.

19:48.754 --> 19:52.383
How about l pick you up at 06:00?
You can ride up front in my jeep.

19:52.457 --> 19:56.086
Ohh! You're on!
l gotta call my dad at the hospital.

19:56.161 --> 19:58.629
Speed dial six.

20:00.499 --> 20:03.764
So long, Mrs. Taylor. Maybe we can
get you to an air show someday.

20:03.835 --> 20:06.531
- Thank you. l'd love that.
- [Brad] Nice meeting you.

20:06.605 --> 20:08.232
- See you, guys.
- Hello, Dad?

20:08.307 --> 20:10.036
<i>- Hi, Mark.
- [Mark] Hey...</i>

20:10.108 --> 20:12.474
<i>...thank you so
much for the Blue Angel thing.</i>

20:12.544 --> 20:15.604
lt's the least l could do.
Next year we'll go together.

20:15.681 --> 20:18.149
Alright, deal.
Know what the cool thing is?

20:18.217 --> 20:20.481
- No idea.
- Lt. Cmdr. Gray is coming here...

20:20.552 --> 20:23.112
<i>- picking me up in his jeep.
- [Tim] Really?</i>

20:23.222 --> 20:25.952
- Thanks again, Dad. Bye.
- You're welcome.

20:27.092 --> 20:29.720
Blue Angel's coming
to pick him up in his jeep?

20:49.181 --> 20:51.149
[stammers] lt was a little loose.

20:53.085 --> 20:56.248
So l decided to put it back
a little tighter.

21:11.737 --> 21:14.501
Nurse, l need a number three scalpel.

21:15.274 --> 21:16.969
Why use a scalpel,

21:17.042 --> 21:21.411
when you can use
a Binford 61 00 chain saw?

21:24.016 --> 21:27.179
- Honey. l didn't know you were a nurse.
- l'm not.

21:27.286 --> 21:29.550
l just love the shoes.

21:30.155 --> 21:32.123
What are you guys operating on today?

21:32.190 --> 21:34.055
- We're not doing the surgery.
- Mmm.

21:34.126 --> 21:37.254
- Well, who is?
- Me, stupidhead!

21:47.472 --> 21:49.531
Don't toy with me.

21:49.608 --> 21:52.372
Oh, this roller is no toy.

21:52.477 --> 21:54.638
lt's a 41 -horsepower...

21:54.713 --> 21:55.975
- Gee whiz!
- [clang]

21:56.048 --> 21:59.017
This roller is no toy.
lt's a 41 -horsepower,

21:59.117 --> 22:03.884
diesel engine, static...

22:03.955 --> 22:05.980

- This roller is no toy.

22:06.058 --> 22:08.492
lt's a 41 - diesel... Gosh darn it!

22:10.329 --> 22:12.263
- [clang]
- This roller is no toy.

22:12.331 --> 22:14.993
lt's got a 41 -horsepower,
diesel engine,

22:15.067 --> 22:17.501
