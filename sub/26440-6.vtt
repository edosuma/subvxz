JONES:
Let's wrap this up.

02:42.872 --> 02:45.833
The fuck? It's light, Mingus.

02:47.042 --> 02:49.420
-Wyatt?
-Oh, yeah, didn't you hear?

02:49.461 --> 02:52.840
The, uh, the bottom's dropped
out of the market.

02:52.882 --> 02:55.342
Yeah, the Zone is, uh,
is heaving with Zed.

02:55.384 --> 02:57.428
And you got home cooking
to compete with.

02:57.469 --> 02:59.179
They're undercutting
your fella now.

02:59.221 --> 03:00.973
-The hell they are.
-Look, that's...

03:01.015 --> 03:03.809
that's more than fair.
I'll be taking a bath as it is.

03:03.851 --> 03:07.062
Don't do me any favors.
Give it back.

03:08.981 --> 03:12.610
Come on. Deal's a deal.

03:12.651 --> 03:15.070
That's right.

03:15.112 --> 03:17.197
And you're light.

03:19.491 --> 03:23.078
Well. Make it up
to you next time.

03:23.120 --> 03:25.581
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
(chuckles)

03:25.623 --> 03:28.167
WYATT: Mingus, you know
I'm your only buyer.

03:28.208 --> 03:30.044
What are you gonna do?

03:30.085 --> 03:31.837
I'll be back next month.

03:31.879 --> 03:35.591
Take all the penicillin
you can get, ditto the morphine.

03:35.633 --> 03:39.178
Mingus, he's playing us
for fools, man.

03:39.219 --> 03:41.263
Hey, hey, hey, get out there.

03:44.016 --> 03:47.102
I'm-a charge you
extra next time.

03:47.144 --> 03:48.938
Sure expect you to.

03:48.979 --> 03:51.690
You are an asshole.

03:51.732 --> 03:54.318
Oh, hey, Jones?

03:56.070 --> 03:57.821
Fuck off, will you?

04:04.787 --> 04:06.789
(phone ringing)

04:09.416 --> 04:10.584
WOMAN:
Hello.

04:10.626 --> 04:12.419
Is Liam there?

04:12.461 --> 04:14.213
Who's calling?

04:14.254 --> 04:16.382
Tell him Santa Fe.

04:16.423 --> 04:19.343
Hang on. I'll see.

04:19.385 --> 04:21.095
Thanks.

04:27.851 --> 04:29.853
WYATT:
Thought you'd lost my number.

04:32.856 --> 04:35.025
I need a favor.

04:37.528 --> 04:39.822
(indistinct chatter)

04:39.863 --> 04:41.865
(flashbulb popping)

04:44.994 --> 04:46.954
Kido-tai.

04:46.996 --> 04:49.039
Cinnadella checked in
several days ago.

04:49.081 --> 04:52.459
Paid a week in advance. A spy.

04:52.501 --> 04:55.421
Obviously.

04:55.462 --> 04:59.049
-Witnesses?
-Not yet.

04:59.091 --> 05:01.885
-The registry?
-Full of false names.

05:01.927 --> 05:04.805
This is a love hotel,
pay by the hour.

05:04.847 --> 05:09.101
I am aware.
What was he doing here?

05:09.143 --> 05:10.686
Sir?

05:10.728 --> 05:13.313
Why would he hide his activities
from his own embassy?

05:13.355 --> 05:16.275
Locate the prostitutes that
frequent this establishment.

05:16.316 --> 05:19.069
Bring them in for questioning.

05:19.111 --> 05:21.697
-(clicks heels)
-Hatt.

05:21.739 --> 05:25.242
(indistinct chatter
in background)

05:41.759 --> 05:43.510
Thank you for coming.

05:43.552 --> 05:45.763
-You all right?
-I'm fine. Can you get this

05:45.804 --> 05:47.890
to Trade Minister Tagomi
at the Nippon Building, please?

05:47.931 --> 05:51.977
So, that's the urgent matter you
couldn't discuss on the phone?

05:52.019 --> 05:53.604
Deliver a package?

05:53.645 --> 05:56.440
-It's really important.
-No, no, no, no.

05:56.482 --> 05:57.649
I'm not your errand boy.

05:57.691 --> 05:59.109
I'm not gonna do
anything for you

05:59.151 --> 06:00.611
until you tell me
what's going on.

06:00.652 --> 06:04.448
It's just better
that you don't know.

06:04.490 --> 06:06.492
Then it's better
you ask somebody else.

06:06.533 --> 06:10.370
Wait. Please, I don't have
anybody else to ask.

06:13.248 --> 06:14.583
All right, I'm in
a lot of fucking trouble.

06:14.625 --> 06:15.876
I need to get out of town,

06:15.918 --> 06:17.461
and I can't go
until this is delivered.

06:17.503 --> 06:20.297
If I do it myself, I'll
be arrested and killed. Please.

06:23.092 --> 06:24.593
Morning, ladies.

06:24.635 --> 06:26.178
JENNIFER AND AMY:
Good morning, Reichsmarschall.

06:26.220 --> 06:29.098
Acting Reichsmarschall.

06:29.139 --> 06:31.308
It's not official
till I'm sworn in.

06:31.350 --> 06:33.519
-That's not what they're saying
on the news. -Well...

06:33.560 --> 06:37.439
for now, "Father"
will do just fine.

06:40.818 --> 06:41.985
Where's Bridget?

06:42.027 --> 06:43.654
Under the weather.

06:43.695 --> 06:46.865
I'm afraid you'll have to put up
with my cooking today.

06:48.242 --> 06:49.993
I think you're
a great cook, Mom.

06:50.035 --> 06:51.453
Yes, the eggs were delicious.

06:51.495 --> 06:52.871
(Helen chuckles)

06:52.913 --> 06:56.959
Thank you, Jennifer.
Thank you, Amy.

06:57.000 --> 06:59.503
It's getting late. Go brush
your teeth, get your books.

06:59.545 --> 07:03.048
It's fine. I'll get those.

07:13.725 --> 07:16.103
It's like old times.

07:16.145 --> 07:18.939
Hmm.

07:21.483 --> 07:23.569
I thought I'd take the girls
shopping after school.

07:23.610 --> 07:25.612
Get them some new dresses
for the ceremony.

07:25.654 --> 07:28.282
-That's nice. They'd love that.
-Mm-hmm.

07:28.323 --> 07:30.576
You don't feel you have to.
I mean, if you're not up to it,

07:30.617 --> 07:31.952
we can get something
sent to the house.

07:31.994 --> 07:33.871
No, I-I think I'm up for it.

07:33.912 --> 07:37.374
-Don't you have Dr. Ryan today?
-I do.

07:37.416 --> 07:39.001
I can manage.

07:41.962 --> 07:44.214
(phone ringing)

07:46.842 --> 07:48.844
Excuse me.

07:50.637 --> 07:52.639
The eggs are delicious.

07:52.681 --> 07:54.808
(chuckles)

07:56.393 --> 07:57.811
(phone continues ringing)

08:01.481 --> 08:03.150
Yes?

08:03.192 --> 08:05.819
MENGELE:
Good morning, Reichsmarschall.

08:05.861 --> 08:07.237
Who is this?

08:07.279 --> 08:08.655
It's Dr. Mengele.

08:08.697 --> 08:11.158
You expressed an interest

08:11.200 --> 08:14.536
in questioning Fatima Hassan.

08:14.578 --> 08:16.455
Yes.

08:16.496 --> 08:21.210
This morning I am bringing her
out of her coma.

08:21.251 --> 08:23.629
Well, thank you
for letting me know.

08:32.387 --> 08:33.764
CARLA:
I passed a girl

08:33.805 --> 08:35.349
in the hallway.

08:35.390 --> 08:38.101
Had you seen her before?

08:38.143 --> 08:41.396
No. She wasn't a working girl.

08:41.438 --> 08:43.941
Is that unusual?

08:43.982 --> 08:48.278
Not exactly a place you bring
your wife or girlfriend.

08:48.320 --> 08:50.530
It's why I remembered her.

08:53.784 --> 08:55.786
Describe her.

08:58.205 --> 09:01.333
Uh, white.

09:01.375 --> 09:02.960
Late 20s maybe.

09:03.001 --> 09:06.129
Um, dark brown hair.

09:06.171 --> 09:07.547
Pretty.

09:07.589 --> 09:09.591
Demeanor?

09:13.595 --> 09:16.181
I don't know.

09:16.223 --> 09:18.350
She seemed distracted.

09:24.398 --> 09:28.568
Do you recognize
any of these women?

09:50.340 --> 09:53.510
Yeah. Her.

10:01.018 --> 10:03.020
(indistinct whisper)

10:07.024 --> 10:09.151
Miss Hassan.

10:09.192 --> 10:11.194
(gasps)

10:15.615 --> 10:17.117
There's no need to panic.

10:17.159 --> 10:18.744
No one's gonna hurt you.

10:18.785 --> 10:20.787
You're safe.

10:23.540 --> 10:25.542
You must be cold.

10:35.635 --> 10:37.637
Do you know where you are?

10:39.639 --> 10:42.184
Nazis.

10:44.186 --> 10:46.355
That's correct.

10:46.396 --> 10:48.857
Where are you from?

10:49.858 --> 10:52.944
I know you're not from here.

10:56.948 --> 10:59.409
When you were, uh, apprehended,

10:59.451 --> 11:01.119
you had a film

11:01.161 --> 11:02.329
in your possession.

11:02.371 --> 11:04.289
Can you tell me
how you got that?

11:04.331 --> 11:06.458
Who gave it to you?

11:08.460 --> 11:10.337
Miss Hassan?

11:17.719 --> 11:19.805
(alarm blaring)

11:19.846 --> 11:21.098
(monitor beeps)

11:21.139 --> 11:23.725
Stand aside, Reichsmarschall.

11:23.767 --> 11:24.893
Please.

11:31.274 --> 11:32.317
Give me another, please.

11:52.045 --> 11:54.047
(alarm continues)

12:02.931 --> 12:05.934
Thank you
for coming so promptly.

12:08.061 --> 12:10.439
How may I help you, Inspector?

12:12.482 --> 12:14.693
Joseph Cinnadella is dead.

12:14.734 --> 12:16.445
Murdered.

12:16.486 --> 12:17.696
What? How?

12:17.737 --> 12:20.240
Someone slit his throat.

12:20.282 --> 12:22.284
In a rabu hoteru.

12:24.286 --> 12:26.746
He doesn't strike me

12:26.788 --> 12:29.916
as a, a man who would frequent
such an establishment.

12:31.960 --> 12:35.714
-This will cause a diplomatic
uproar. -That is why

12:35.755 --> 12:37.632
I wanted you to know
as soon as possible.

12:37.674 --> 12:41.094
Robbery and murder.

12:41.136 --> 12:43.972
That is the obvious explanation.

12:44.014 --> 12:47.100
So you are questioning
prostitutes?

12:49.144 --> 12:52.230
When is the last time you saw
Juliana Crain?

12:54.274 --> 12:56.401
A few days ago. Why?

12:56.443 --> 12:57.611
A witness--

12:57.652 --> 12:59.988
a prostitute-- saw her

13:00.030 --> 13:01.948
outside his room last night.

13:01.990 --> 13:04.159
I went to her motel

13:04.201 --> 13:06.495
and found blood in her bathroom.

13:06.536 --> 13:09.456
Miss Crain has disappeared.

13:09.498 --> 13:12.292
Perhaps the witness
was mistaken.

13:12.334 --> 13:14.336
(chuckles)

13:22.219 --> 13:25.222
Your relationship
with this woman...

13:26.264 --> 13:29.809
...is perplexing.

13:29.851 --> 13:33.021
Why did you invite Miss Crain
to engage Mr. Cinnadella

13:33.063 --> 13:34.731
at your reception?

13:34.773 --> 13:37.776
They had
a previous relationship.

13:37.817 --> 13:42.572
She was attempting to gain
information on the oil crisis.

13:42.614 --> 13:45.200
And what information
did she acquire?

13:45.242 --> 13:48.161
Nothing.

13:56.836 --> 14:00.131
I will file a full report
with the admiral.

14:00.173 --> 14:05.178
If you hear from her,
you will contact me immediately.

14:14.854 --> 14:17.482
(intercom beeps)

14:17.524 --> 14:19.484
Yes?

14:19.526 --> 14:21.361
METZGER (over intercom):
Sir, Chief Inspector Kido

14:21.403 --> 14:23.822
is on the line.

14:26.199 --> 14:30.412
All right, put him through.

14:30.453 --> 14:33.582
(intercom beeps)

14:33.623 --> 14:35.917
Chief Inspector,
what can I do for you?

14:35.959 --> 14:40.213
I have some bad news,
Reichsmarschall.

14:40.255 --> 14:42.549
I'm listening.

14:44.884 --> 14:47.762
RYAN:
How you feeling today?

14:47.804 --> 14:50.223
Mmm, more myself.

14:50.265 --> 14:52.851
And what's that?

14:52.892 --> 14:55.895
Uh, a good wife...

14:55.937 --> 14:59.065
a good mother.

14:59.107 --> 15:01.526
Happy.

15:04.195 --> 15:08.283
-I made breakfast this morning
for my family. -Wow.

15:08.325 --> 15:11.620
It's important to feel useful,
needed.

15:11.661 --> 15:13.622
Yeah.

15:13.663 --> 15:15.832
While you're in this frame
of mind, why don't you

15:15.874 --> 15:18.835
share another memory of Thomas?

15:18.877 --> 15:21.880
Um, something from childhood.

15:21.921 --> 15:24.841
Oh.

15:26.426 --> 15:29.638
Yeah. Wh-When I gave birth
to Jennifer,

15:29.679 --> 15:32.766
um, oh, I was so anxious.

15:32.807 --> 15:37.729
It was... for three whole years,
it was just me and Thomas,

15:37.771 --> 15:41.733
my-my sweet, baby boy.

15:41.775 --> 15:45.070
Life was perfect.

15:45.111 --> 15:47.781
I didn't know how
he would react.

15:47.822 --> 15:51.242
-How did he react?
-Uh, I came home

15:51.284 --> 15:53.328
from the hospital.

15:53.370 --> 15:56.915
John brought Thomas
into the nursery.

15:56.956 --> 15:58.792
Thomas didn't even look at me.

15:58.833 --> 16:01.127
He walked right over
to the crib.

16:01.169 --> 16:05.465
He peeked over the railing
to see his sister.

16:05.507 --> 16:09.344
Oh. He turned to us
and-and he said,

16:09.386 --> 16:13.348
"Look. It's my baby."

16:13.390 --> 16:16.101
That's a lovely memory.

16:16.142 --> 16:20.105
I was also relieved that
John and I, we could finally...

16:23.066 --> 16:25.735
(laughing)

16:25.777 --> 16:28.071
Sorry.

16:28.113 --> 16:29.948
What's so funny?

16:29.989 --> 16:33.076
Mm.

16:35.578 --> 16:39.082
Uh, well, it's a rather
embarrassing admission.

16:39.124 --> 16:40.667
I... (clears throat)

16:40.709 --> 16:43.670
...I was going to say
make love again.

16:43.712 --> 16:45.672
Well, there's nothing
embarrassing about that.

16:45.714 --> 16:48.508
It's... perfectly normal.

16:48.550 --> 16:51.219
I assure you,

16:51.261 --> 16:53.847
most married couples
feel the same.

16:55.265 --> 16:57.225
Hmm.

16:57.267 --> 16:59.269
HIMMLER (on screen): You believe
the story of a prostitute?

16:59.310 --> 17:01.020
No, I don't.

17:01.062 --> 17:03.815
Then you think the Japanese
killed him in retribution?

17:03.857 --> 17:06.401
-For Diels and Wexler?
-I think it unlikely, sir,

17:06.443 --> 17:10.739
they would, uh, risk
the diplomatic repercussions

17:10.780 --> 17:12.907
-of doing so.
-Still, they reap the benefits,

17:12.949 --> 17:14.409
don't they?

17:14.451 --> 17:16.619
Wexler's files were valuable.

17:16.661 --> 17:18.538
We must assume
they have them back now.

17:18.580 --> 17:20.999
Yes, Reichsfuhrer.

17:21.040 --> 17:24.836
Why did the Japanese call you?

17:24.878 --> 17:28.173
They must think that Josef
was your man, not mine.

17:28.214 --> 17:30.383
I don't know.

17:30.425 --> 17:33.386
I'm sending Director Hoover
down to the JPS

17:33.428 --> 17:37.682
to... try to get
to the bottom of this.

17:37.724 --> 17:40.685
I leave things in your hands,
Reichsmarschall.

17:54.991 --> 17:56.993
Ja, Mein Fuhrer.

18:13.635 --> 18:15.595
Excuse me, sir.

18:15.637 --> 18:17.347
This package was left for you

18:17.388 --> 18:19.057
at the reception desk.

18:19.098 --> 18:20.850
By?

18:20.892 --> 18:22.644
One of the Chinese
delivery boys.

18:22.685 --> 18:23.770
Arigato, Kotomichi.

18:29.776 --> 18:32.445
(doors slide shut)

19:02.225 --> 19:04.477
♪ ♪

19:35.466 --> 19:38.136
♪ ♪

19:56.487 --> 19:58.907
(engine shuts off)

20:05.914 --> 20:07.290
We'll gas up.

20:07.332 --> 20:09.292
If the border crossing's open

20:09.334 --> 20:10.710
and normal,

20:10.752 --> 20:12.295
then we'll chance it.

20:12.337 --> 20:14.380
-And if it's not?
-(creaking)

20:14.422 --> 20:16.841
Then we'll wing it.

20:30.021 --> 20:31.439
No.

20:37.612 --> 20:39.489
(clanging)

20:47.246 --> 20:50.500
(lever creaking)

20:51.834 --> 20:53.628
Damn it.

20:53.670 --> 20:56.005
(clears throat)

20:57.090 --> 20:58.675
Maybe there's some gas

20:58.716 --> 21:01.928
in that rust bucket over there
we can siphon.

21:03.930 --> 21:07.100
(vehicle approaching)

21:20.655 --> 21:22.991
Kempeitai.

21:33.751 --> 21:35.795
(engine shuts off)

21:43.052 --> 21:44.470
What are you doing here?

21:45.513 --> 21:47.306
Looking for gas.

21:47.348 --> 21:48.558
Trespassing.

21:48.599 --> 21:50.101
This station is closed.

21:50.143 --> 21:51.102
Where are you going?

21:51.144 --> 21:52.520
WYATT:
The border.

21:52.562 --> 21:54.480
OFFICER:
Border's closed.

21:54.522 --> 21:55.940
Show us your papers.

21:55.982 --> 21:57.942
Nah, that's all right.
We'll just...

21:57.984 --> 21:59.402
We'll turn around.

21:59.444 --> 22:01.195
Your papers.

22:23.176 --> 22:24.761
Oi.

22:26.721 --> 22:29.015
Hai.

22:29.057 --> 22:30.600
Stand against the truck.

22:30.641 --> 22:32.101
Come on.

22:32.143 --> 22:33.186
-Now!
-WYATT: Hey!

22:33.227 --> 22:35.938
Shut up!

22:46.115 --> 22:47.492
What's this?

22:47.533 --> 22:49.243
Protection,
for the Neutral Zone.

22:49.285 --> 22:50.870
(shouts in Japanese)

22:52.330 --> 22:54.082
(grunting)

22:57.168 --> 22:59.128
WYATT:
Juliana!

23:08.387 --> 23:11.974
So, tell me
there's another way across.

23:12.016 --> 23:14.936
There's
always another way across.

23:21.818 --> 23:25.029
You've done this before.

23:25.071 --> 23:27.281
Oh, yeah.

23:27.323 --> 23:29.909
KIDO: You were working
with the scientist Wexler,

23:29.951 --> 23:31.327
were you not?

23:31.369 --> 23:32.787
Yes, a sensitive project.

23:32.829 --> 23:34.080
Synthetic oil.

23:35.414 --> 23:37.708
These documents
are highly classified

23:37.750 --> 23:38.960
Kempeitai files.

23:39.001 --> 23:40.378
Where did you get them?

23:40.419 --> 23:42.338
They were brought to me.

23:44.340 --> 23:47.468
Is it possible they were in
the possession of the Nazi spy

23:47.510 --> 23:48.928
at the time of his death?

23:48.970 --> 23:50.805
Possibly, yes.

23:51.848 --> 23:53.224
Whoever killed him appears

23:53.266 --> 23:56.394
to have prevented
an attempt on your life.

23:56.435 --> 23:59.313
Tell me, Trade Minister,

23:59.355 --> 24:01.816
why would the Nazis
want you dead?

24:01.858 --> 24:03.818
A provocation. Revenge.

24:03.860 --> 24:05.236
A warning.

24:06.279 --> 24:10.283
So, any number of reasons.

24:10.324 --> 24:14.787
Let me ask you something,
Chief Inspector.

24:14.829 --> 24:19.750
What are you going to do
about the traitor in your midst?

24:30.469 --> 24:32.972
I didn't hear you come in.

24:33.014 --> 24:34.557
No, I, uh...

24:34.599 --> 24:36.392
Well, how was your day?

24:36.434 --> 24:39.395
Well, I took the girls shopping.

24:39.437 --> 24:42.148
I got them
the most adorable blue dresses.

24:42.190 --> 24:43.900
So you didn't need Bridget?

24:43.941 --> 24:46.736
Mm-mm.

24:46.777 --> 24:49.447
She wasn't really sick, was she?

24:49.488 --> 24:51.657
You gave her the day off?

24:51.699 --> 24:53.659
I may have done.

24:53.701 --> 24:55.286
(chuckles)

25:01.250 --> 25:03.502
Thank you.

25:04.545 --> 25:07.089
It wasn't just for you.

25:07.131 --> 25:08.591
Hmm?

25:08.633 --> 25:11.802
The way things are going...

25:11.844 --> 25:15.223
with everything...

25:15.264 --> 25:18.601
(sighs)
I need you.

25:20.519 --> 25:23.231
I'm aware of the pressure
that you're facing, John.

25:23.272 --> 25:24.523
I am.

25:25.524 --> 25:28.527
Joe's dead, Helen.

25:30.404 --> 25:32.615
He was killed in San Francisco.

25:32.657 --> 25:34.617
Oh, my God.

25:34.659 --> 25:36.702
(sighs)

25:36.744 --> 25:39.163
Oh, John, I'm so sorry.

25:39.205 --> 25:41.332
That's not all.

25:41.374 --> 25:43.668
It was Joe

25:43.709 --> 25:45.503
that killed Erich Raeder.

25:45.544 --> 25:47.255
What? No.

25:47.296 --> 25:48.506
-I don't believe that...
-He was under orders

25:48.547 --> 25:51.259
from the Reichsfuhrer.

25:51.300 --> 25:54.929
Despite everything I did
to... try to protect him,

25:54.971 --> 25:57.598
Himmler felt that, uh...

25:57.640 --> 26:00.226
that he was
a potential liability.

26:00.268 --> 26:02.895
A liability to who? To him?

26:02.937 --> 26:04.939
To me.

26:08.985 --> 26:11.821
To me, Helen.

26:11.862 --> 26:15.408
He's got plans for me.

26:16.450 --> 26:18.411
He's made it clear

26:18.452 --> 26:21.956
that there is to be
no margin of error.

26:23.416 --> 26:27.586
Nothing to threaten my standing
in the Party.

26:27.628 --> 26:30.047
Nothing.

26:32.341 --> 26:36.304
So, I'm glad you...

26:36.345 --> 26:38.931
had a good day.

26:40.766 --> 26:44.770
It's important
you continue to have them.

26:55.573 --> 26:57.533
(soft music playing)

26:57.575 --> 27:00.494
CHILDAN:
A most astute analysis.

27:00.536 --> 27:04.373
Yes, of course, the film,
it-it's patently absurd.

27:04.415 --> 27:06.375
Baka-gété-masu.

27:06.417 --> 27:08.919
Stagecoach,
it-it's not history,

27:08.961 --> 27:13.299
it's a-a powerful example
of American self-delusion.

27:13.341 --> 27:17.053
And John Wayne was, perhaps,

27:17.094 --> 27:20.598
the greatest emblem
of that mentality.

27:20.639 --> 27:24.310
You may recall the scene
in which he-he leaped down

27:24.352 --> 27:27.646
from his seat, landing between
two rows of runaway horses?

27:27.688 --> 27:29.607
-Best scene.
-Yeah.

27:29.648 --> 27:31.609
Risking life and limb,

27:31.650 --> 27:34.403
all for the sake of crafting
a-a mythical Wild West

27:34.445 --> 27:35.988
in-in the American mind.

27:36.030 --> 27:37.656
Stuntman.

27:37.698 --> 27:39.617
I'm sorry?

27:39.658 --> 27:42.411
Stuntman.

27:42.453 --> 27:44.413
Ah.

27:44.455 --> 27:46.540
But, sir, if I may,
you're mistaken.

27:46.582 --> 27:50.795
Uh, John Wayne was, himself,
a stuntman.

27:50.836 --> 27:53.214
Americans insisted that their,
their screen heroes

27:53.255 --> 27:54.423
do their own stunts,

27:54.465 --> 27:56.675
risk their lives

27:56.717 --> 27:58.928
in the pursuit of an illusion.

28:00.596 --> 28:04.558
It's truly rare
to find an object of such, um,

28:04.600 --> 28:09.355
intriguing historical
contradiction.

28:24.286 --> 28:27.415
So? How much did you get?

28:27.456 --> 28:29.792
Enough to get home.

28:29.834 --> 28:31.335
Good.

28:31.377 --> 28:34.004
So this calls for a celebration.

28:34.046 --> 28:36.048
And I happen to know that
there's a high-caliber bottle

28:36.090 --> 28:38.634
of Kenbishi tucked
just behind the bar.

28:38.676 --> 28:40.344
Kenbishi?
(gasps)

28:40.386 --> 28:42.388
(exhales)

28:50.980 --> 28:52.982
To you.

28:53.023 --> 28:55.025
Safe journey home.

28:57.111 --> 28:58.654
Bobby.

29:00.531 --> 29:03.200
Nice to see you
spreading your wings.

29:03.242 --> 29:04.702
Eddie.

29:04.743 --> 29:06.704
(laughs)

29:18.507 --> 29:22.011
Hey, a moment. Um, I called in
about a case of red wine.

29:22.052 --> 29:23.721
-Okay. -So, can you go see
if you guys have that?

29:27.141 --> 29:30.311
Is it Ed-- Ed McCarthy?

29:32.188 --> 29:33.772
Mr. Sampson?

29:33.814 --> 29:34.899
Hi.

29:34.940 --> 29:36.525
Um...

29:36.567 --> 29:39.570
God, it is so good to see you.

29:39.612 --> 29:41.197
You, too.

29:41.238 --> 29:43.199
Uh, well, hello again.

29:43.240 --> 29:45.034
You didn't tell me
you knew Ed McCarthy.

29:45.075 --> 29:48.454
The thought would
never occur to me.

29:48.496 --> 29:53.667
Um, Ed, could-could I talk
to you about something?

29:53.709 --> 29:55.252
-Yeah, sure.
-Just-just-- yeah.

29:55.294 --> 29:57.713
Right here, come--
just come on in here.

30:01.383 --> 30:04.470
I, um, Ed, I-I've, uh,
I've got some news.

30:04.512 --> 30:07.431
And it's important
that you don't react.

30:07.473 --> 30:10.017
At all.

30:10.059 --> 30:12.061
Okay.

30:13.812 --> 30:16.232
Frank is alive.

30:22.863 --> 30:24.865
How much farther?

30:26.909 --> 30:30.246
I think we crossed
a couple miles back.

30:32.164 --> 30:34.375
Why didn't you say anything?

30:36.627 --> 30:41.006
Well, I, uh...

30:41.048 --> 30:45.886
didn't want
to celebrate prematurely.

30:45.928 --> 30:49.640
Thanks for getting me out.

30:49.682 --> 30:52.184
Here.

30:57.523 --> 30:58.691
JOE:
Here.

30:58.732 --> 31:00.693
Drink this.

31:00.734 --> 31:02.736
Come on.

31:12.913 --> 31:14.873
What have I done?

31:14.915 --> 31:18.419
You did what you had to do.

31:21.672 --> 31:24.925
I killed a man once.

31:24.967 --> 31:27.761
How do you live with that?

31:27.803 --> 31:30.055
I don't know.

31:30.097 --> 31:32.099
It changes you.

31:34.310 --> 31:37.396
But you go on.

31:37.438 --> 31:39.440
You have to, Juliana.

32:07.051 --> 32:11.847
You know, you, uh, handled
yourself pretty well back there.

32:16.602 --> 32:22.024
Take it that's not the first...
time you've killed someone.

32:27.363 --> 32:30.949
The silence of bad memories.

32:33.619 --> 32:36.997
After the war, I joined up
with the Rebel American Army.

32:39.041 --> 32:40.918
As good a group of lost causers

32:40.959 --> 32:42.920
as you're ever gonna meet.

32:44.963 --> 32:48.425
You remind me
of being with them.

32:51.720 --> 32:54.973
Do you still have connections?

32:58.352 --> 33:01.146
Well, the RAA became
the Resistance.

33:01.188 --> 33:02.773
Some of them.

33:02.815 --> 33:04.817
-Not you?
-Well...

33:05.859 --> 33:07.861
I did my best.

33:09.947 --> 33:11.949
Why?

33:14.868 --> 33:17.871
I don't know, there's somebody
I'd like to find.

33:20.624 --> 33:24.628
I don't know where he is,
or if he's even still alive.

33:27.047 --> 33:29.091
Do you have his name?

33:31.009 --> 33:34.054
Why are you helping me?

33:34.096 --> 33:38.016
'Cause good dance partners
are hard to find.

33:39.893 --> 33:42.146
(inhales)

33:42.187 --> 33:44.565
(exhales)

33:44.606 --> 33:46.233
HOOVER:
Ambassador Weber gave me

33:46.275 --> 33:49.445
a full briefing on Mr.
Cinnadella's activities here.

33:49.486 --> 33:51.739
Sanctioned by your government.

33:51.780 --> 33:53.991
No, no.

33:54.032 --> 33:57.619
Both Diels and Wexler
were traitors.

33:57.661 --> 33:59.997
And under our protection.

34:00.038 --> 34:01.999
Well, nevertheless,

34:02.040 --> 34:03.917
from our point of view,
the scales are balanced.

34:03.959 --> 34:06.545
And any further retribution,
well...

34:06.587 --> 34:08.172
that would be regrettable.

34:08.213 --> 34:10.758
That is not for me to decide.

34:10.799 --> 34:12.217
I understand, Inspector.

34:12.259 --> 34:13.761
But Reichsfuhrer Himmler?

34:13.802 --> 34:15.220
You see, he's eager

34:15.262 --> 34:17.973
to close the books
on this investigation.

34:18.015 --> 34:19.808
Put this whole mess behind us.

34:19.850 --> 34:21.226
KIDO: We will be sure
to keep you apprised

34:21.268 --> 34:24.188
as the investigation continues.

34:24.229 --> 34:27.274
Much appreciated,
Chief Inspector.

34:27.316 --> 34:29.485
Thank you for your time.

34:30.527 --> 34:33.906
How long will you be our guest?

34:33.947 --> 34:36.575
Well, that depends now,
doesn't it?

34:36.617 --> 34:40.329
I do know Mr. Cinnadella
was not here

34:40.370 --> 34:43.457
just to assassinate
Nazi defectors.

34:43.499 --> 34:47.044
He had other targets.

34:47.085 --> 34:49.505
Japanese targets.

34:49.546 --> 34:54.259
The scales are not balanced,
Director.

35:02.392 --> 35:04.520
HOOVER (on phone):
Well, I suspected Juliana Crain

35:04.561 --> 35:06.688
was with Joe Cinnadella
the night he died.

35:06.730 --> 35:08.607
The Kempeitai has the Yakuza

35:08.649 --> 35:10.484
searching the Neutral Zone
for her.

35:10.526 --> 35:13.028
I trust our people
will find her first?

35:13.070 --> 35:14.780
Well, that would be the idea.

35:14.822 --> 35:16.949
Honestly, though,
I don't think the Kempeitai

35:16.990 --> 35:18.992
is that interested
in catching his killer.

35:19.034 --> 35:20.869
Why's that?

35:20.911 --> 35:22.996
Apparently, Mr. Cinnadella

35:23.038 --> 35:25.749
was also targeting an important
Japanese official.

35:25.791 --> 35:27.668
At the Fuhrer's behest.

35:27.709 --> 35:30.420
The Reichsfuhrer must have
his reasons.

35:30.462 --> 35:32.172
I'm sure of that.

35:32.214 --> 35:35.926
But it does make for awkward
conversations with the Pons.

35:37.344 --> 35:39.513
I'm sure you can keep the matter
from escalating.

35:39.555 --> 35:40.889
Of course.

It's an amphetamine.

37:05.891 --> 37:07.434
Stimulant. Listen.

51:37.720 --> 51:41.015
(echoing):
to the death.

51:51.234 --> 51:54.904
Ba-r'chu et a-do-nai
ha-m'vo-rach.

51:57.114 --> 52:00.910
SABRA CROWD: Ba-ruch et a-do-nai
ha-m'vo-rach

52:00.952 --> 52:04.539
léolam va-éd.

52:04.580 --> 52:06.582
HIMMLER:
A wise woman once told me

52:06.624 --> 52:11.087
our destinies are written
in the stars.

52:11.128 --> 52:15.424
I was a failing chicken farmer.

52:15.466 --> 52:18.845
And then I met the Fuhrer.

52:18.886 --> 52:21.472
Like me,

52:21.514 --> 52:25.309
you must learn
to embrace the new role

52:25.351 --> 52:28.646
that fate has handed you.

52:28.688 --> 52:33.860
SAMPSON: I knew some
of Frank's family for years.

52:35.361 --> 52:37.947
And we've all suffered loss.

52:37.989 --> 52:40.741
Hmm? Everybody here.

52:40.783 --> 52:45.454
And the-the question
I think we each struggle with--

52:45.496 --> 52:47.915
I know I do-- is:

52:47.957 --> 52:52.795
how do we live
with our own survival?

52:52.837 --> 52:56.924
How do we make use of this life
that we still have?

52:56.966 --> 53:01.679
Now, Frank bears the scars
of that question.

53:01.721 --> 53:05.433
But-but the Frank
I know today has taught me

53:05.474 --> 53:07.894
the importance
of our traditions.

53:10.146 --> 53:13.149
They hold the pain and joy

53:13.190 --> 53:16.110
of 5,000 years.

53:16.152 --> 53:20.197
Today marks the beginning

53:20.239 --> 53:24.911
of Jahr Null,

53:24.952 --> 53:28.414
Year Zero.

53:28.456 --> 53:33.085
This will become
the beating heart...

53:33.127 --> 53:37.423
SAMPSON: When we connect
to the past, Hashem speaks.

53:37.465 --> 53:40.092
And it tells us how to survive.

53:40.134 --> 53:42.386
(laughs)

53:42.428 --> 53:44.889
(applause)

53:52.480 --> 53:54.440
HIMMLER:
We will do

53:54.482 --> 53:57.234
away with the old.

53:57.276 --> 54:01.489
Today, history ends!

54:01.530 --> 54:05.826
And the future

54:05.868 --> 54:08.746
begins!

54:11.415 --> 54:13.209
CROWD:
Sieg heil!

54:13.250 --> 54:16.629
Sieg heil! Sieg heil! Sieg heil!

54:16.671 --> 54:21.467
Sieg heil! Sieg heil!
Sieg heil! Sieg heil!

54:21.509 --> 54:26.263
Sieg heil! Sieg heil!
Sieg heil! Sieg heil!
