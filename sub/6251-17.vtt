Okay, just kissing.
No touching things

What, touch his genitalia? No.

Though you are thinner now,
which is better for your

01:56.158 --> 01:58.945
In high school,
you were quite overweight,

01:59.036 --> 02:01.152

from the other students.

of staining,

02:49.086 --> 02:51.498

Oh! No. Not cut up.

We’re gonna need
to search the bushes

You gotta go to your reunion,

High school was not a happy time.

- Ribs gone.
- They never found the killer.

That’s what
we called him.

Insect activity puts time of death
at approximately 10 days ago.

04:42.032 --> 04:43.988
You should swab
the dismemberment points.

04:44.076 --> 04:45.987
There could be trace evidence
from a blade.

04:46.078 --> 04:48.740
You get very bossy when you
don’t have flesh to play with.

04:48.831 --> 04:50.742
I am the boss.

04:50.833 --> 04:54.291
And he removes
his victim’s ribs because?

04:54.378 --> 04:56.414
He eats them. Barbecue.

04:56.505 --> 04:58.882
You don’t actually
believe that?

04:58.966 --> 05:01.503
There’s no evidence of cannibalism.
It’s merely an urban legend.

05:01.594 --> 05:04.427
But they never found out
who killed the girl
in your class?

05:04.513 --> 05:06.424
No. Sarah Tidwyler.

05:06.515 --> 05:10.508
Booth is getting
the old case files
to find links.

05:10.603 --> 05:12.514
The stumps on the victim’s
fourth and fifth ribs...

05:12.605 --> 05:14.220
show evidence
of hemorrhagic staining.

05:14.315 --> 05:16.476
So two ribs
weren’t
sawed off.

05:16.567 --> 05:19.730
Fractured and then snapped off
it appears.

05:21.071 --> 05:23.608
So your high school
is famous, sweetie.

05:23.699 --> 05:29.194
The earliest recorded mention
of the Butcher of Burtonsville
was in 1956.

05:29.288 --> 05:33.452
Young people were warned
to avoid secluded locations at n/ght. ..

05:33.542 --> 05:37.751
as there was a lunatic
who killed and dismembered
his vict/ms...

05:37.838 --> 05:40.045
and then barbecued
and ate their ribs.

05:40.132 --> 05:42.339
Yet, until Sarah’s murder,

05:42.426 --> 05:44.542
it was just an urban legend—

05:44.637 --> 05:48.095
society’s attempt
to control behavior
through a fear-based myth.

05:48.182 --> 05:51.219
This is very
teenage slasher movie-ish.

05:51.310 --> 05:56.725
Whatever blade was used
left very clean
and precise cuts.

05:56.815 --> 06:00.103
It’s always a tad creepy
when you admire
the killer’s handiwork.

06:02.071 --> 06:06.030
Now, this first victim, Sarah Tidwyler,
was a member of the class of ’94?

06:06.116 --> 06:08.732
And the second victim was killed just
before the reunion of the same class.

06:08.827 --> 06:10.738
It doesn’t sound like
a coincidence to me.

06:10.829 --> 06:12.444
The cops here agreed
to keep everything quiet...

06:12.540 --> 06:14.906
until we ID. the victim
and catalog the evidence.

06:15.000 --> 06:19.118
And this, uh, Ray Buxley
was a prime suspect in ’94?

06:19.213 --> 06:22.046
He was the high school custodian,
but they didn’t have enough to hold him.

06:22.132 --> 06:24.043
Lives alone, low-status job,

06:24.134 --> 06:26.386

crime stories,

06:26.470 --> 06:28.381

06:28.472 --> 06:31.009
Very creepy.
It’s, like, Freddy creepy.

06:31.100 --> 06:33.011
Okay. Well,
I’m gonna go
check him out.

06:33.102 --> 06:36.845
Since you’re trying to keep the town
from another wave of collective hysteria,

06:36.939 --> 06:39.931
I wouldn’t suggest
announcing your F.B.|. status.

06:40.025 --> 06:43.313
- We go undercover.
- Exactly.

06:43.404 --> 06:45.895
Since Bones was
already invited
to the reunion,

06:45.990 --> 06:49.528

if she’s seen as an alumni.

06:49.618 --> 06:51.609

07:00.004 --> 07:02.495

07:02.590 --> 07:05.707
Yeah, but they are not
adjoining rooms.

07:05.801 --> 07:08.713
Okay, Sweets?
Look. They do not adjoin.

07:08.804 --> 07:12.217
You can see...

07:12.308 --> 07:15.300
- And I’m closer
to the ice machine.
- No, I’m merely asking...

07:15.394 --> 07:17.385
because of your feelings
for Dr. Brennan.

07:17.479 --> 07:20.095
I get it. All right, Sweets,
I respect that, but I’ve moved on.

07:20.190 --> 07:23.648

07:23.736 --> 07:27.729
- Thanks. Take care.
- Who might that be, Booth?

07:27.823 --> 07:30.690
Booth, who might that be ?

07:30.868 --> 07:32.449

some metal flakes...

of the bones.

A lot of violence.
A lot of drugs.

Very briefly, Wendell.

08:38.227 --> 08:40.969
Why didn’t you tell me?
I’m pretty sure
I’m the only possibility.

08:41.063 --> 08:43.429
Yes. Yes. Of course.

08:45.526 --> 08:49.269
Do you think that we could talk about this later
and-and— and maybe not here?

Oh, of course. I’m sorry.
I was just—

08:54.576 --> 08:57.739

discuss this later.

09:01.875 --> 09:04.457
How well do you know
this, uh, custodian?

09:04.545 --> 09:07.708
Very well. He used to find
dead animals for me to dissect.

09:07.798 --> 09:10.710
We used to have
long discussions about death.

09:10.801 --> 09:12.837

it was a natural process.

what you’re talking about.

09:16.974 --> 09:20.432
Well, in high school,
you had a creepy custodian
as a best friend.

09:20.561 --> 09:24.850
I bet you had a pet rat too.
No. I had a mouse
and a snake and some spiders.

09:24.940 --> 09:27.101
Wow. And you
weren’t popular.
Now, that’s amazing.

09:27.192 --> 09:31.026
Oh! I am so sorry.
My nerves are totally fried.

Wow.

Uh,yeah.
All over the place.

10:16.575 --> 10:19.942
Well, we have
a gym to decorate, so—

10:20.037 --> 10:22.574
You know,
Evelyn is gonna be so happy
to see you, Temperance.

10:22.706 --> 10:25.743
“Bygones are bygones,”
she always says.
You married Evelyn Simms?

10:25.834 --> 10:30.123
We were all so jealous.
Evelyn’s off saving
some unpronounceable country.

10:30.255 --> 10:32.541
Uh, Nicaragua.
See?

10:32.633 --> 10:35.215
So Prom King Brad here’s
been giving me a hand.

10:35.344 --> 10:38.461
Evy’s gonna be flying back for the reunion.
We’ll see you there.
Good to meet you, Bobby.

10:38.555 --> 10:41.012
Yeah.
“Bygones be bygones.”

10:41.099 --> 10:43.932
What did that Brad guy mean?
What’s going on between
you and Evelyn?

10:44.061 --> 10:46.393
Something happen?
It’s not important.
We were children.

10:46.480 --> 10:48.721
We should go see Mr. Buxley.

10:51.610 --> 10:53.601
[Ange/a ]
By morning,
/ knew / wasn ’t pregnant,

10:53.695 --> 10:56.528
so l-l— I saw no reason
to bring it up.

10:56.615 --> 10:59.277
What you’re saying would make
perfect sense to Dr. Brennan,

10:59.368 --> 11:02.326
but it— it feels wrong,
you know?

11:02.412 --> 11:04.949
Well, maybe I should
have told you.

11:05.040 --> 11:07.201
I don’t know. I—

11:07.292 --> 11:09.669

was gonna bring up
a bunch of questions...

11:09.753 --> 11:11.709
that we weren’t
ready for.

11:11.797 --> 11:13.833
I can answer those questions.

11:13.924 --> 11:17.917
- Well, what do you mean?
- If you got pregnant,
it’s your decision what to do.

11:18.011 --> 11:20.388
Well, yeah. I know it is.

11:20.472 --> 11:22.508
| get that, but...

11:22.599 --> 11:25.932
if you decided to keep the baby,
I would do the right thing.

11:27.688 --> 11:30.521
You would?
I absolutely would.

11:30.607 --> 11:34.850
I’d bear my share of the consequences,
more than my fair share.

11:34.945 --> 11:37.231
I’d marry you
if that’s what you wanted.

11:38.782 --> 11:40.647
I would do the right thing.

11:43.453 --> 11:46.581

So you’re pressed
for an ID.

15:25.634 --> 15:27.716
I’ll try to be quick
with the facial reconstruction.

15:27.803 --> 15:30.215
Turns out our victim
has a remodeled
mandibular fracture.

15:30.305 --> 15:33.092
- So that should
narrow down the search.
- Let me look at that.

15:33.183 --> 15:35.515
Can you put it
under the medio cam?

15:38.855 --> 15:43.645
- [A nge/a ] is there a problem ?
- This fracture was made
by a blunt object...

15:43.735 --> 15:46.522
striking her face
at an almost 90-degree angle.

15:46.613 --> 15:50.652
That’s in my notes. Yes.
And the remodeling gave us
an approximate age— about 30.

15:50.742 --> 15:53.734
- Thirty-three. She was 33.
- Well, how do you know that?

15:53.829 --> 15:57.993
Because I’m the one
who broke herjaw,
with a tennis racket.

This is one of my classmates.

16:00.669 --> 16:02.580

A girl like this— she wouldn’t
have given me the time of day,

16:23.942 --> 16:26.228

makes her that much hotter.

you really didn’t wanna
say that out loud, right?

- Everybody loved Evelyn.

16:32.200 --> 16:34.111
A lot of people hated her, too,
for being so popular.

Although my classmates
thought I hit her on purpose.

16:41.960 --> 16:43.916
Well, perhaps
subconsciously you did.

16:44.004 --> 16:47.041
I mean, a girl like yourself
with marginal social standing...

16:47.132 --> 16:49.839

by striking the popular girl.

16:49.926 --> 16:53.919
- It is quite common.
- Okay, that sounded clinical,
but felt very insulting.

- Basic victimology.

None of this is pertinent
to the investigation.

hasn’t worked out,

nothing like Evelyn.

his arm around her.

when she was murdered

17:38.934 --> 17:41.846
And now he’s married
to the most recent victim.

17:41.937 --> 17:44.644
It’s a pretty strong connection.

17:50.195 --> 17:53.653
This is a cross section
of the victim’s distal femur.

17:53.740 --> 17:56.026
As you can see, the kerf wall is smooth,
indicating whatever blade was used,

17:56.117 --> 17:58.494
the size of its teeth was small.

17:58.578 --> 18:01.820
But it did have teeth.
So we’re looking
for a saw of some type.

18:01.915 --> 18:05.658
Judging by the bone loss
from the cuts, a saw blade
about two millimeters thick.

18:05.794 --> 18:09.002

what type of blade yet though.
Let me know when you can.

and sinews tearing—

and expertise,

in any way cooler than

thought I was pregnant,
he said, “I’m your guy.”

form the bedrock
of civilization.

19:32.922 --> 19:36.790
- It’s not very poetic.
- Because males tended
to find those duties onerous,

19:36.885 --> 19:38.921
they took every opportunity
to avoid them,

geographic exploration,

less likely than Wendell...

Hey, just hold that.

Look, just hold up the star
and smile, sweetheart.

So the star points

36:29.855 --> 36:33.188
[ Saroyan ] An exact match
for the injuries
found on the bones.

36:33.275 --> 36:36.358
Yeah, and the edging
shows that the stars
were cut by the same saw...

36:36.445 --> 36:38.356
that was used
to dismember the body.

36:38.447 --> 36:40.358
But there are multiple wounds.

36:40.449 --> 36:44.033
It’s hard to believe that
she was stabbed repeatedly
with a star until she was killed.

36:44.119 --> 36:46.906
Can you show us the placement
of all the bone injuries?

36:52.127 --> 36:54.834
[ Saroyan ]
Stab wounds
are usually localized

36:54.922 --> 36:57.163
Maybe there were
multiple stars.

36:57.257 --> 36:59.919
There. Look.

[A nge/a ] Okay, well,
this is the drying rack.

37:04.932 --> 37:09.050
Uh, this is where they placed the stars
when the varnish was drying.

37:09.144 --> 37:11.931
So let’s see
if the points line up.

37:12.022 --> 37:13.933
[ Wendell]
The wounds are so deep.

37:14.024 --> 37:15.935
Falling on them
wouldn’t kill her.

37:16.026 --> 37:18.142
[Ange/a ]
Well, unless somebody
shoved her onto them.

37:18.237 --> 37:20.819
[Wendell ]
That explains the two ribs
that were broken and not cut.

37:20.906 --> 37:24.490
They were fractured
when the murderer
threw Evelyn onto the stars.

37:24.576 --> 37:26.487
Digging the stars
into her bones...

37:26.578 --> 37:29.115
and puncturing
the pleural cavity,
killing her.

37:29.206 --> 37:32.323

hated her.

Okay, thanks, Cam.

The stars are
the murder weapon.

37:45.222 --> 37:48.259
They were made
on the same band saw
that dismembered Evelyn.

No, Mr. Buxley.

It was my turn to have him.

39:16.855 --> 39:18.766
I beg
your pardon?

39:18.857 --> 39:21.348
Evelyn and I made a pact
in high school.

39:21.443 --> 39:24.731
We got rid of Sarah
so we could share Brad.
We had a pact.

Someone should tell him
that I’m here.

than you found him.
