murder, honey. I can't get into
much more trouble than that.

00:05.222 --> 00:06.528
Dominique's your stepmom?

00:06.571 --> 00:07.833
You got to promise
not to tell Jeff and Monica.

00:07.877 --> 00:09.574
Dominique will kill me.We're sisters.

00:11.533 --> 00:14.449
Now, you would've thought
that my poisoning your father

00:14.492 --> 00:16.059
would've done the trick.

00:16.103 --> 00:17.756
NADIA:
I've got him wrapped
around my little finger.

00:17.800 --> 00:19.845

This is Joseph Anders.

01:03.063 --> 01:05.065
BROWN:
This is D.A. Erica Brown,

01:05.108 --> 01:07.980
the lead prosecutor in the case
against Blake Carrington.

01:08.024 --> 01:10.200
And you're just calling to make
sure I got your subpoena.

01:10.244 --> 01:11.810
How thoughtful.

01:11.854 --> 01:14.291
We have records of you coming
in contact with the victim.

01:14.335 --> 01:16.380
Well, I come in contact
with a lot of people.

01:16.424 --> 01:17.860
Most I don't recall.

01:17.903 --> 01:20.123
Well, if you happen to recall
the truth in this case,

01:20.167 --> 01:22.778
and are worried for some reason
about incriminating yourself,

01:22.821 --> 01:24.693
we can offer you full immunity

01:24.736 --> 01:27.391
in exchange
for your honest testimony.

01:27.435 --> 01:29.872
If you'll excuse my French,
you can take your immunity

01:29.915 --> 01:31.395
and shove it up your...

01:31.439 --> 01:33.702
CROWD :
Murderer! Murderer!

01:33.745 --> 01:36.008
Murderer! Murderer!

01:36.052 --> 01:37.445
Murderer! Murderer!

01:37.488 --> 01:40.404
As I said,
this case isn't about me.

01:40.448 --> 01:44.147
This is about one man being held
accountable for his actions.

01:44.191 --> 01:46.758
That's why it's The People
v. Blake Carrington.

01:46.802 --> 01:49.196
We're very confident that we
have more than enough evidence

01:49.239 --> 01:51.285
to make our case.

01:53.200 --> 01:54.375
Mmm.

01:56.551 --> 01:59.293
Prosecution obviously
has nothing.

01:59.336 --> 02:00.642
That's why
she's constantly on TV

02:00.685 --> 02:02.252
talking about how guilty I am.

02:02.296 --> 02:05.516
Now, Vegas has me
at even money to walk. Huh?

02:05.560 --> 02:08.215
Not to bet against the house--
or the manor, in this case--

02:08.258 --> 02:10.347
but didn't they find Mac

02:10.391 --> 02:13.045
wrapped in a body bag
with your DNA on it?

02:13.089 --> 02:14.656
Oh, a drop of DNA
will never hold up

02:14.699 --> 02:16.179
against my army of lawyers.

02:16.223 --> 02:18.225
And the justice system
wins again.

02:20.096 --> 02:22.533
Don't listen to
him, Father.

02:22.577 --> 02:25.754
I saved the last case of Blue
Belt's reserve vintage for us

02:25.797 --> 02:27.582
to crack open when
you're acquitted.

02:27.625 --> 02:29.061
I know how much
you love the winery,

02:29.105 --> 02:30.367
so I thought it was fitting.

02:30.411 --> 02:31.760
CRISTAL:
How thoughtful, Adam.

02:31.803 --> 02:34.458
Did Nadia hold your hand
while you picked that out?

02:34.502 --> 02:36.547
Or maybe you don't
need her anymore?

02:36.591 --> 02:39.333
No, no. Nadia has been
instrumental in, uh...

02:43.946 --> 02:44.947
Is everything okay, son?

02:44.990 --> 02:47.471
Yeah. Yeah, I--
Everything's fine.

02:47.515 --> 02:50.387
I just, um,
I j-- I just need a minute.

02:50.431 --> 02:51.910
FALLON:
Well,

02:51.954 --> 02:55.958
I've been subpoenaed to testify,
for the other side.

02:56.001 --> 02:57.699
They're probably gonna ask
me about your character.

02:57.742 --> 02:59.918
Well, I trust you will
be honest and truthful

02:59.962 --> 03:01.529
as you extol my virtues.

03:01.572 --> 03:05.228
What virtues? I'm not gonna
perjure myself to save your ass.

03:05.272 --> 03:06.708
Hey, no one asked you to lie.

03:06.751 --> 03:09.319
However, I happen to know
that your magazine

03:09.363 --> 03:11.495
launches in a few days,
and a little positive press

03:11.539 --> 03:13.062
on your father couldn't hurt.

03:13.105 --> 03:16.239
Well, I didn't start a magazine
to be your PR mouthpiece.

03:16.283 --> 03:17.414
But don't worry,

03:17.458 --> 03:18.937
I will publicly support you.

03:18.981 --> 03:20.678
I'll even put on a special

03:20.722 --> 03:23.594
"Dad is on trial
but probably innocent" outfit.

03:23.638 --> 03:26.423
Mm. Speaking of...

03:29.296 --> 03:30.601
The nerve.

03:30.645 --> 03:33.300
You know, if my father
wants positive press,

03:33.343 --> 03:35.171
then he should just
buy his own magazine.

03:35.215 --> 03:37.260
You know? Like
a normal person.

03:37.304 --> 03:40.437
I mean, does he not understand
that my future as a media mogul

03:40.481 --> 03:43.788
depends entirely on the success
of this first issue?

03:43.832 --> 03:46.095
Belt?

03:46.138 --> 03:47.749
Well, he is on trial

03:47.792 --> 03:50.795
for murder, so he may have
his mind on other things.

03:50.839 --> 03:52.144
Oh, please.

03:52.188 --> 03:55.800
This is who he is.
Controlling, ruthless.

03:55.844 --> 03:57.759
Always trying
to spin things.

03:57.802 --> 04:00.588
Speaking of, are you sure
you're not tempted

04:00.631 --> 04:03.286
to put a positive spin
on this article?

04:03.330 --> 04:05.462
Me? I'm not writing it.

04:05.506 --> 04:07.769
No, I am, as you already know.

04:07.812 --> 04:10.772
I'm just wondering
if my publisher/girlfriend

04:10.815 --> 04:12.774
is gonna censor
what I want to say.

04:12.817 --> 04:16.473
Liam, I am not like my father.

04:16.517 --> 04:18.954
Okay? This apple fell
so far from the tree

04:18.997 --> 04:20.782
that people aren't even sure
if it's an apple.

04:20.825 --> 04:22.262
Mm.

04:22.305 --> 04:24.960
So you write your article

04:25.003 --> 04:26.657
the way that
you want,

04:26.701 --> 04:28.311
as long as you meet
your deadline tomorrow

04:28.355 --> 04:30.487
so we can publish it online.

04:30.531 --> 04:32.881
You are so hot
when you order me around.

04:38.365 --> 04:40.410
MONICA:
I thought I made it pretty
clear on Thanksgiving

04:40.454 --> 04:41.585
that I didn't want
to see you again.

04:41.629 --> 04:43.065
I was hoping
you would have processed

04:43.108 --> 04:45.241
this whole "Vanessa is
my stepdaughter" thing by now.

04:45.285 --> 04:47.548
You lied to me and Jeff
about who she was

04:47.591 --> 04:49.767
and tried to use us
to launch her career.

04:49.811 --> 04:52.466
I'm sorry if that takes
more than a few days to process.

04:52.509 --> 04:53.989
Please don't let
your anger for me

04:54.032 --> 04:55.164
affect how you feel
about Vanessa.

04:55.207 --> 04:57.645
She's innocent
in all of this.

04:57.688 --> 04:59.037
The club residency...

04:59.081 --> 05:00.474
Is gone.

05:00.517 --> 05:01.779
And I'm gonna have
Jeff change the locks

05:01.823 --> 05:04.826
so you can stop barging in here
like you belong.

05:04.869 --> 05:07.742
Where is Jeff?
He's been unreachable all week.

05:07.785 --> 05:10.484
His assistant said he would
be back from the airport by now.

05:10.527 --> 05:12.921
Oh, is that why you're here?

05:12.964 --> 05:15.837
You thought you could come over
here and do damage control.

05:15.880 --> 05:18.230
Well, good luck,
'cause Jeff is gonna be

05:18.274 --> 05:19.841
even more pissed than I am
when he hears about this.

05:19.884 --> 05:22.844
JEFF:
Oh, Jeff
already knows.

05:22.887 --> 05:27.022
I looked into your so-called
client while I was in Europe.

05:27.065 --> 05:29.024
Jeff...I don't need your
excuses. Okay?

05:29.067 --> 05:31.374
I've had enough of those
for an entire lifetime.

05:31.418 --> 05:34.159
I don't hate you. I'm not
cutting you out of my life.

05:34.203 --> 05:37.206
But I know exactly
who you are.

05:37.249 --> 05:39.339
And I've made my peace with it.

05:41.950 --> 05:45.170
Enough peace to promote Vanessa
on your streaming service?

05:46.389 --> 05:48.348
Don't push your luck.
I'm not the Dalai Lama.

05:48.391 --> 05:50.393
MITCHELL:
Prosecution is offering

05:50.437 --> 05:51.786
a pretrial plea deal.

05:51.829 --> 05:53.788
25 years.Did you just meet me?

05:53.831 --> 05:55.529
I'm not spending
25 years in prison.

05:55.572 --> 05:57.095
And I'm not pleading
guilty to murder.

05:57.139 --> 05:58.793
If the jury finds you
guilty, you could face

05:58.836 --> 06:00.621
life in prison or worse.

06:00.664 --> 06:02.797
You assured me things
were looking solid.

06:02.840 --> 06:04.015
They were.

06:04.059 --> 06:05.626
But then I heard
from my man on the inside

06:05.669 --> 06:08.411
that the district attorney
has an ace up her sleeve.

06:08.455 --> 06:10.848
A secret witness she's trying
to add who could place Mac

06:10.892 --> 06:13.329
at the manor around
the coroner's time of death.

06:13.373 --> 06:14.765
What? Who is it?

06:14.809 --> 06:16.463
I have no idea,

06:16.506 --> 06:18.726
but you should seriously
consider taking the deal.

06:22.120 --> 06:23.470
Are you thinking
what I'm thinking?

06:23.513 --> 06:25.036
That we got a rat.

06:25.080 --> 06:27.517
Trouble is, a lot of people
live and work at the manor.

06:27.561 --> 06:30.520
Question everyone.

06:30.564 --> 06:32.566
Trust no one. Find out who it is

06:32.609 --> 06:34.611
and eliminate the problem.

06:45.492 --> 06:47.972
Ladies and gentlemen of the
jury, we're here today to settle

06:48.016 --> 06:50.105
a very simple question.

06:50.148 --> 06:52.281
Is Blake Carrington a murderer?

06:52.324 --> 06:54.022
Now, I know what
you might be thinking.

06:54.065 --> 06:57.373
Not this respectable,
successful man,

06:57.417 --> 06:59.288
whose face you've seen
on the cover of Time

06:59.331 --> 07:01.290
and Forbesmagazine.

07:01.333 --> 07:03.379
But Mr. Carrington
has another side.

07:03.423 --> 07:06.513
One you won't see
on magazine covers.

07:06.556 --> 07:08.906
Dark, ruthless,

07:08.950 --> 07:12.301
with a temper only surpassed
by his bank account.

07:12.344 --> 07:14.390
A man so lacking in morals

07:14.434 --> 07:16.740
he would hire a hit man
to solve his problems.

07:16.784 --> 07:18.916
And when that hit man
dared to turn on him,

07:18.960 --> 07:21.571
Blake Carrington murdered him.

07:21.615 --> 07:26.402
And then left his body to rot
in his fancy, private lake.

07:26.446 --> 07:28.839
The jury is eating this up.

07:28.883 --> 07:32.408
Yeah. And Daddy looks
like he's about to explode.

07:32.452 --> 07:35.759
After hearing our evidence
and witness testimony,

07:35.803 --> 07:38.240
it will be undeniable
that Blake Carrington

07:38.283 --> 07:39.720
deserves to be
brought to justice

07:39.763 --> 07:42.026
and judged guilty of murder.

07:45.552 --> 07:47.815
You might want to tone down
the death stares

07:47.858 --> 07:50.121
while the jury is watching you.

07:50.165 --> 07:51.471
They're believing this crap.

07:51.514 --> 07:53.690
You can't lose your temper.

07:53.734 --> 07:55.779
That's exactly what
they're hoping for.

07:55.823 --> 07:57.955
We hooked up twice that night

07:57.999 --> 08:00.001
and again in the morning.
: And...

08:00.044 --> 08:01.524
let me tell you,

08:01.568 --> 08:04.309
Joel has the most gorgeous...

08:04.353 --> 08:05.833
Can you please tone it down?

08:05.876 --> 08:07.530
I have customers here.

08:07.574 --> 08:09.184
Plus, I'm going
through a dry spell.

08:09.227 --> 08:10.533
What about Fletcher, the PR guy?

08:10.577 --> 08:12.013
I thought he kissed you.He did.

08:12.056 --> 08:13.797
And then I never heard back.

08:13.841 --> 08:15.973
Must have meant nothing.Never engage with
negativity, Sam.

08:16.017 --> 08:18.846
Think positive and it'll happen.

08:18.889 --> 08:21.849
Okay, rainbows and butterflies
are not your best look.

08:21.892 --> 08:24.416
It's all Joel. He told me
I was his best student

08:24.460 --> 08:27.419
at the meditation and motivation
seminar in Savannah last week.

08:27.463 --> 08:28.682
I mean,

08:28.725 --> 08:29.726
you should've seen him teach,

08:29.770 --> 08:31.075
it was like he was...

08:31.119 --> 08:32.555
touching my soul.

08:32.599 --> 08:35.036
Just when I was finally starting
to get my appetite back.

08:35.079 --> 08:36.733
He wants me to spend
a bit of time at the HQ

08:36.777 --> 08:38.256
in South Carolina.

08:38.300 --> 08:39.736
Thinks I'll benefit
from being around

08:39.780 --> 08:41.869
other people
that think with light.

08:41.912 --> 08:43.392
And you're going?

08:43.435 --> 08:46.787
I want to, but I should
probably be here for my dad

08:46.830 --> 08:49.180
while he's dealing with
the craziness of Blake's trial.

08:49.224 --> 08:52.227
Especially since he moved back
into the manor.

08:52.270 --> 08:54.403
That's always gonna be his home.
It's his happy place.

08:54.446 --> 08:55.752
It's like

08:55.796 --> 08:58.059
the manor touches his soul.Okay.

08:58.102 --> 08:59.495
You know what?

08:59.539 --> 09:02.759
I'm feeling my, uh,
negative energy rise, so, uh,

09:02.803 --> 09:05.414
I'm gonna go find Joel
and meditate.

09:05.457 --> 09:06.589
Mm.

09:06.633 --> 09:09.592
And by meditate,
you mean sex, huh?

09:09.636 --> 09:11.420
I worked for six years
as Blake's driver

09:11.463 --> 09:13.161
and was his business partner
as well.

09:13.204 --> 09:17.165
Isn't it true that you would
often drive the victim,

09:17.208 --> 09:19.515
Nathan MacIntosh, at
Mr. Carrington's request?

09:19.559 --> 09:22.866
Yeah. Blake relied on Mac
to do his dirty work.

09:22.910 --> 09:24.781
Objection.Sustained.

09:24.825 --> 09:26.391
I'm sorry.

09:26.435 --> 09:28.611
Yes. I drove him at times.

09:28.655 --> 09:31.266
Mr. Carrington told the police

09:31.309 --> 09:33.529
that he hadn't seen
Mr. Macintosh in ten years.

09:33.573 --> 09:36.010
When was the last time you saw
Blake and him interact?

09:36.053 --> 09:38.012
Wow. Ten years?

09:38.055 --> 09:39.709
Good thing he wasn't under oath.

09:39.753 --> 09:41.276
Objection.He can't say that!

09:41.319 --> 09:42.799
Just answer the
question, please.

09:42.843 --> 09:44.105
CULHANE:
Sorry.

09:44.148 --> 09:45.976
I saw Mac regularly

09:46.020 --> 09:47.978
up until the time
I quit two years ago.

09:48.022 --> 09:49.980
So you knew what he
did for a living?

09:50.024 --> 09:51.808
He was a fixer
for Atlanta's elite.

09:51.852 --> 09:55.420
For the right amount of money,
he'd do anything you needed.

09:55.464 --> 09:59.424
Intimidation, beating, murder.

09:59.468 --> 10:01.035
BROWN:
And were you surprised

10:01.078 --> 10:03.864
that Blake Carrington had this
type of person in his life?

10:03.907 --> 10:06.431
Oh, not at all.
They're cut from the same cloth.

10:06.475 --> 10:09.652
After all, I know
that Blake is capable of murder.

10:09.696 --> 10:11.480
I've seen it.

10:11.523 --> 10:13.656
That man killed my father.

10:13.700 --> 10:15.876
Hey, he's-he's ly--
He's a raging liar.Objection! We are not trying

10:15.919 --> 10:17.312
Mr. Carrington for...He is lying.

10:17.355 --> 10:19.009
Sit down, Mr. Carrington.

10:19.053 --> 10:20.489
You lose control again,

10:20.532 --> 10:23.144
you'll be watching this trial
from a jail cell.

10:23.187 --> 10:25.320
ANDERS:
Because of the nature
of this trial,

10:25.363 --> 10:28.410
I will be speaking
to every employee.

10:28.453 --> 10:30.238
Now, let's get started.

10:30.281 --> 10:33.850
Have you ever heard anyone speak
poorly of Mr. Carrington?

10:33.894 --> 10:36.853
The groundskeepers hate that
he never cleans up after Bo.

10:36.897 --> 10:38.550
Mrs. Gunnerson thinks that

10:38.594 --> 10:40.335
he doesn't appreciate
her cooking enough.

10:40.378 --> 10:41.336
He loves my cooking.

10:41.379 --> 10:42.685
Have you seen or heard anyone

10:42.729 --> 10:44.034
meeting with the authorities?

10:44.078 --> 10:46.646
Mrs. Gunner's uncle
used to work for HUD.

10:48.038 --> 10:49.692
That's a government
authority, right?

10:49.736 --> 10:51.476
I think Tony might
know something.

10:51.520 --> 10:52.608
I don't know anything.

10:52.652 --> 10:53.783
And he's always bragging about

10:53.827 --> 10:55.698
how his kids love
video games.

10:55.742 --> 10:58.527
ANDERS:
I hear your children
like video games.

11:00.224 --> 11:02.139
Maybe I do know something.

11:04.402 --> 11:05.708
But I shouldn't.

11:07.362 --> 11:09.799
All this glaring is getting
a little unsettling.

11:09.843 --> 11:12.715
Don't shoot the messenger...
or the gardener.

11:12.759 --> 11:14.543
I was hanging with someone here
last weekend.

11:14.586 --> 11:18.547
I heard 'em on the phone
say the word "FBI."

11:18.590 --> 11:19.983
Who was it?

11:20.027 --> 11:22.290
Kirby.

11:24.684 --> 11:27.164
You're really doing
so well on your own.

11:27.208 --> 11:28.688
Pretty soon, you won't
need me at all.

11:28.731 --> 11:30.167
Don't say that.

11:30.211 --> 11:33.867
You know, I-I have
been wondering what...

11:33.910 --> 11:35.825
what happens if I do
get my vision back?

11:35.869 --> 11:39.699
Well, for one, I'd be
thrilled for you.

11:39.742 --> 11:42.049
As for my job,
the agency I'm with

11:42.092 --> 11:43.746
will place me somewhere new.

11:43.790 --> 11:47.054
But we'd still...
see each other.

11:47.097 --> 11:49.186
Well, some of my patients
aren't in the city.

11:49.230 --> 11:50.318
Or the state.

11:50.361 --> 11:52.450
But we'll work things out
somehow.

11:52.494 --> 11:53.582
You know what this needs?

11:53.625 --> 11:54.975
Some of those special
Brooklyn olives.

11:55.018 --> 11:56.193
Be right back.

11:56.237 --> 11:57.934
Okay.

12:22.350 --> 12:24.439
Nadia! I--What happened?

12:24.482 --> 12:26.093
I was just trying
to make us some tea,

12:26.136 --> 12:27.790
and I thought I could
do it by myself.

12:27.834 --> 12:29.270
Oh, it's all my fault.

12:29.313 --> 12:31.446
I never should have
left you here alone.

12:31.489 --> 12:34.666
I just pushed myself
too far, I guess.

12:34.710 --> 12:36.712
It was stupid.

12:36.756 --> 12:40.498
Well, I'm here now
for however long you need.

12:41.673 --> 12:43.806
Your little Thanksgiving
stunt cost us

12:43.850 --> 12:45.634
the residency at Colby Club.

12:45.677 --> 12:48.898
How many times do you
want me to apologize?

12:48.942 --> 12:51.031
I am sorry that
I let it slip to Monica

12:51.074 --> 12:52.467
that I am your stepdaughter.

12:52.510 --> 12:53.816
Can we please more on now?

12:53.860 --> 12:56.123
Actually, we can.

12:56.166 --> 12:57.602
But only because I've decided

12:57.646 --> 12:59.953
Blake is going to help us
get what we need.

12:59.996 --> 13:01.476
A record contract?

13:01.519 --> 13:02.782
A record contract, yes.

13:02.825 --> 13:03.826
But so much more.

13:03.870 --> 13:07.308
I'm talking about
our brand.

13:07.351 --> 13:08.788
Our empire.

13:08.831 --> 13:12.008
And my half step-uncle
is offering to help us?

13:12.052 --> 13:14.141
In the middle of
his murder trial?

13:14.184 --> 13:17.013
No. But while the
national spotlight

13:17.057 --> 13:19.407
is focused on the Carringtons,
there's no reason why

13:19.450 --> 13:21.452
we can't take some of it
for ourselves.

13:22.714 --> 13:25.500
We're gonna be national news.

13:25.543 --> 13:27.937
Hmm.

13:27.981 --> 13:32.159
I think I might have developed
feelings for him.

13:32.202 --> 13:33.508
I even thought about
going to Blake

13:33.551 --> 13:35.031
and confessing everything.

13:35.075 --> 13:37.860
You're kidding.

13:37.904 --> 13:39.514
Right? I mean,

13:39.557 --> 13:41.646
honey, you're a good actress,
but the whole therapist

13:41.690 --> 13:43.605
with a heart of gold routine
just isn't playing.

13:43.648 --> 13:44.867
You know, you're not
the first person

13:44.911 --> 13:46.086
who's tried to squeeze
money out of me,

13:46.129 --> 13:47.652
though you may be the cutest.

13:47.696 --> 13:50.220
You'll get the rest
once you pull the trigger.

13:50.264 --> 13:52.396
Adam is finally in love.

13:52.440 --> 13:54.659
So break his heart,
if you can find it.

13:54.703 --> 13:56.792
Look at this.

13:56.836 --> 13:59.403
Secret meeting in the gun room,

13:59.447 --> 14:01.536
a bag filled with cash.

14:01.579 --> 14:02.798
Book club meeting?

14:02.842 --> 14:04.365
What are you doing here,
Cristal?

14:04.408 --> 14:06.323
Like you said,
this is a secret meeting.

14:06.367 --> 14:08.064
Oh, I was actually
looking for Nadia,

14:08.108 --> 14:09.326
so I could fire her.

14:09.370 --> 14:11.720
But this seems
so much better than that.

14:11.763 --> 14:14.810
Cristal, I know that we are
not exactly friends,

14:14.854 --> 14:17.421
but you're not gonna tell
my daddy about this.

14:17.465 --> 14:19.162
Whatever you're up to,
I want in.

14:19.206 --> 14:20.598
Or else I will go to Daddy,

14:20.642 --> 14:22.035
and everything
you've been plotting

14:22.078 --> 14:24.254
will go up in smoke.

14:24.298 --> 14:25.603
Poof.

14:42.620 --> 14:44.274
Yeah, it's me.

14:44.318 --> 14:47.669
Yeah, I need a background check
on the owner of a black sedan,

14:47.712 --> 14:51.978
KLZF917.

14:52.021 --> 14:54.023
Thanks.

14:59.855 --> 15:01.074
Show me to my seat.

15:01.117 --> 15:03.946
Dominique Deveraux,
sister of the accused.

15:03.990 --> 15:05.948
I don't see you
listed here as family.

15:05.992 --> 15:07.645
Did you win one of
the lottery tickets?

15:07.689 --> 15:11.432
Do I look like I need
a lottery ticket?

15:11.475 --> 15:12.694
Cristal, could you tell
this ridiculous man

15:12.737 --> 15:14.174
that I'm family?

15:14.217 --> 15:16.741
I'm sorry,
I don't know this woman.

15:16.785 --> 15:18.482
Cris-Cristal!

15:21.529 --> 15:24.227
Are you done spit shining
our Bible, Ms. Carrington?

15:24.271 --> 15:26.229
Oh, Your Honor,
I am in the process

15:26.273 --> 15:27.361
of launching a magazine,

15:27.404 --> 15:29.450
so I cannot afford
to get sick.

15:29.493 --> 15:30.930
All right, I'm done now.

15:30.973 --> 15:33.280
Do you swear to tell the truth

15:33.323 --> 15:34.977
the whole truth,
and nothing but the truth?

15:35.021 --> 15:37.849
On my new custom
Gucci purse, yes.

15:37.893 --> 15:39.851
BROWN:
Ms. Carrington,

15:39.895 --> 15:42.376
would you describe your father
as a temperamental man?

15:42.419 --> 15:45.988
Well, I believe "passionate"
is the PC term.

15:46.032 --> 15:48.164
According to various
news reports,

15:48.208 --> 15:51.733
he has routinely thrown items
at family and staff members

15:51.776 --> 15:53.517
when he loses his temper;
is that true?

15:53.561 --> 15:55.998
Well, I'm not sure that
I would say "routinely."

15:56.042 --> 15:58.609
But he always aims just to
the side of a person's head.

15:58.653 --> 15:59.915
This is not true.
FALLON:
For what it's worth.

15:59.959 --> 16:01.743
Are you aware that several
of his assistants

16:01.786 --> 16:04.485
came forward last year
with stories of their abuse?

16:04.528 --> 16:05.660
I am, yes, but...

16:05.703 --> 16:06.966
Are you aware of any

16:07.009 --> 16:09.011
instances when your father
broke the law?

16:09.055 --> 16:11.492
Objection!
Relevance?Your Honor,

16:11.535 --> 16:14.364
Mr. Carrington's historical
disregard for morals and laws

16:14.408 --> 16:17.019
is crucial to establishing
his capacity for murder.

16:17.063 --> 16:18.020
Overruled.

16:18.064 --> 16:19.500
You can answer.

16:19.543 --> 16:22.024
I am aware that you don't get
to be Blake Carrington

16:22.068 --> 16:23.504
without breaking
a few Fabergés,

16:23.547 --> 16:25.245
if you know what I mean.

16:25.288 --> 16:26.333
I don't know what you mean.

16:26.376 --> 16:28.639
But moving on,
what about instances

16:28.683 --> 16:31.338
where he's paid off police
or a politician?

16:31.381 --> 16:33.340
I can neither confirm
nor deny that.

16:33.383 --> 16:35.907
Are you aware that your father
hired Mac

16:35.951 --> 16:38.345
to perform illegal activities,
such as covering up the death

16:38.388 --> 16:39.868
of a teenage girl
in your home?

16:41.174 --> 16:45.395
I did tell the police that, yes.

16:47.223 --> 16:49.356
Ms. Carrington,
do you believe your father

16:49.399 --> 16:50.705
is capable of murder?

16:50.748 --> 16:53.012
Can I plead the Fifth?

16:53.055 --> 16:54.709
Your face is saying no.
I can tell.

16:54.752 --> 16:58.974
Um, I believe that everyone

16:59.018 --> 17:00.715
is capable of murder.

17:00.758 --> 17:02.412
You know?
Under the right circumstances.

17:02.456 --> 17:04.066
BROWN: We don't need
a dissertation

17:04.110 --> 17:05.981
on the human condition,
Ms. Carrington.

17:06.025 --> 17:10.507
So, then... yes.

17:10.551 --> 17:14.250
He's capable, but-but only
in a universal kind of way.

17:14.294 --> 17:15.730
No more questions.

17:15.773 --> 17:17.036
Huh.

17:17.079 --> 17:19.821
Somehow, I don't think
my own daughter suggesting

17:19.864 --> 17:21.605
that I could kill
someone was helpful.

17:21.649 --> 17:23.433
No, it wasn't.

17:23.477 --> 17:25.740
We need to go after her.

17:25.783 --> 17:28.134
The question is how hard?

17:33.574 --> 17:35.967
NADIA:
I can't wait. Mm-hmm.

17:36.011 --> 17:38.013
Meet me in
the loft tonight?

17:38.057 --> 17:41.364
Mm. I miss you, too.

17:42.713 --> 17:44.019
Adam!

17:45.151 --> 17:47.022
I didn't see you there.

17:47.066 --> 17:48.415
Who were you talking to?

17:48.458 --> 17:50.112
No one important.

17:50.156 --> 17:51.766
But it's lunchtime.

17:51.809 --> 17:53.115
Let me make you something
in the kitchen.

17:53.159 --> 17:54.943
Come on.

17:58.599 --> 18:01.428
Would you say that you have
a vendetta against your father?

18:01.471 --> 18:02.733
Of course not.

18:02.777 --> 18:04.518
And didn't you steal
Carrington Atlantic from him

18:04.561 --> 18:05.780
and then sell it?

18:05.823 --> 18:07.260
I didn't steal anything.

18:07.303 --> 18:09.131
We got a great price,
and I don't know why

18:09.175 --> 18:11.394
you're acting like I'm the one
on trial right now.

18:11.438 --> 18:14.354
Did you leak his dead wife's
sex tape

18:14.397 --> 18:16.399
with zero regard
for his feelings?

18:18.009 --> 18:20.751
Wow. I-I did, yes, but...

18:20.795 --> 18:22.449
Do you hate your father because
he cut you out of his will?

18:22.492 --> 18:23.711
Objection!

18:23.754 --> 18:25.278
BROWN: Leading.I don't care about his will.

18:25.321 --> 18:27.018
Sustained.

18:27.062 --> 18:29.586
Isn't it true that if your
father has bribed the law,

18:29.630 --> 18:32.154
it was to get you out of
numerous DUIs,

18:32.198 --> 18:34.635
and that he offered you
multiple jobs,

18:34.678 --> 18:36.637
and then you had him
fired as CEO

18:36.680 --> 18:37.942
from his own company?

18:37.986 --> 18:40.467
Can you define "numerous"?

18:40.510 --> 18:42.817
Is this why you are perceived--

18:42.860 --> 18:45.733
and I'm quoting
several articles here--

18:45.776 --> 18:47.865
as "nothing but a spoiled,
rich brat

18:47.909 --> 18:50.085
who wouldn't be anywhere
without her father"?

18:50.129 --> 18:52.043
Objection!

18:52.087 --> 18:53.219
Order, Ms. Carrington!

18:53.262 --> 18:55.960
You are in contempt
and will be fined.

19:05.883 --> 19:07.320
How dare you!

19:07.363 --> 19:08.756
How dare I what, hmm?

19:08.799 --> 19:10.366
Last time I checked,
this is my house,

19:10.410 --> 19:11.802
and you called me a murderer.

19:11.846 --> 19:15.284
So if I want some grapes,
I will have some grapes.

19:15.328 --> 19:16.851
I did not call you
a murderer.

19:16.894 --> 19:19.201
I said you were
capable of murder.

19:19.245 --> 19:20.376
Same difference.

19:20.420 --> 19:21.812
Oh, you'll be fine.

19:21.856 --> 19:23.205
Goodbye.

19:23.249 --> 19:25.512
I really hope
you are reporting

19:25.555 --> 19:28.384
on every bad thing
that happened in court today.

19:28.428 --> 19:30.560
And to think he wants
favorable coverage.

19:30.604 --> 19:33.607
"The heiress lost her cool

19:33.650 --> 19:36.784
and displayed an unknown talent
for gavel hurling."

19:37.828 --> 19:40.396
Wow. You're really
writing about that?

19:40.440 --> 19:42.920
I'm reporting on the trial,
and it's--

19:42.964 --> 19:45.096
Fallon, it's part of the trial.

19:45.140 --> 19:47.186
And I'm guessing you
haven't looked online lately,

19:47.229 --> 19:49.231
because I'm not the only one
writing about it.

19:49.275 --> 19:50.711
No, no, that's true,

19:50.754 --> 19:52.756
but you are the only one
who happens to be my boyfriend,

19:52.800 --> 19:54.628
and writing for my own magazine,

19:54.671 --> 19:57.979
so, I don't know, a hit piece
on me being insane

19:58.022 --> 20:00.068
really doesn't feel like
the best way to go on this one.

20:00.111 --> 20:03.332
No offense, but Ididn't
make you look insane.

20:03.376 --> 20:05.073
But how do you think
that'll make me look,

20:05.116 --> 20:07.249
writing an obviously
biased article?

20:07.293 --> 20:09.164
Like someone who doesn't
want me to be the joke

20:09.208 --> 20:10.731
of the publishing community.

20:10.774 --> 20:12.254
Fallon, you said
I should write this

20:12.298 --> 20:14.169
however I wanted.

20:14.213 --> 20:16.345
Is it always gonna be like this
working with you?

20:16.389 --> 20:19.957
You know what,
you're, uh, you're right.

20:20.001 --> 20:22.221
You do what you need to do.

20:24.745 --> 20:27.487
I've discovered the identity
of our mystery witness, sir.

20:28.792 --> 20:31.230
It's Kirby.
What?

20:31.273 --> 20:32.274
How do you know?

20:32.318 --> 20:33.710
Well, I was tailing her,

20:33.754 --> 20:35.103
and I didn't recognize someone
she was talking to,

20:35.146 --> 20:36.583
so I ran his plates,

20:36.626 --> 20:39.238
and it turned out the car
belongs to a federal agency.

20:40.761 --> 20:44.199
She's always blamed the family
for my heart attack.

20:44.243 --> 20:45.635
Didn't want me coming back here.

20:45.679 --> 20:47.246
She thinks that you are toxic.

20:47.289 --> 20:48.595
So we'll deal with her...

20:48.638 --> 20:50.074
the way we would
any other traitor.

20:50.118 --> 20:51.598
She is my daughter, sir.

20:51.641 --> 20:54.427
And this is largely my fault.
I let her go far too young.

20:54.470 --> 20:56.516
She deserved better from me.

21:00.911 --> 21:04.741
We all do the best
we can as parents, Anders.

21:04.785 --> 21:07.918
You were a good one
to me when I needed you.

21:07.962 --> 21:10.443
Kirby made her own choice here.

21:10.486 --> 21:13.576
Try not to think too much
about it tonight.

21:14.838 --> 21:17.058
We'll figure out how
to handle this tomorrow,

21:17.101 --> 21:18.538
together.

21:20.409 --> 21:22.455
I can't stop thinking
about how you let our mother

21:22.498 --> 21:23.717
off the hook
yesterday.

21:23.760 --> 21:25.153
Dom is who she is.

21:25.196 --> 21:26.807
And the sooner you
accept that, the better.

21:26.850 --> 21:30.245
But I do have
some other news for you.

21:30.289 --> 21:32.639
Hey. Hope I'm not interrupting.

21:32.682 --> 21:34.554
No, not at all.

21:34.597 --> 21:37.383
I called you both here
to tell you that

21:37.426 --> 21:39.472
I need a break from all this.

21:39.515 --> 21:41.387
So I'm going to New York
for a while.

21:41.430 --> 21:43.998
You don't have to leave because
of Dom's craziness, okay?

21:44.041 --> 21:45.347
That's just our family.

21:45.391 --> 21:46.740
We're extra.

21:46.783 --> 21:49.177
I'm opening the new club
there anyway,

21:49.220 --> 21:51.614
and I was wondering if you'd
want to come with me.

21:51.658 --> 21:53.573
None of this mess
is your fault,

21:53.616 --> 21:55.879
and it'd be cool to get to know
a new family member.

21:55.923 --> 21:57.751
Who knows, maybe
we could work together.

21:57.794 --> 21:59.405
You're talented.

21:59.448 --> 22:02.364
And believe me, I know you don't
need our mom's crazy to make it.

22:02.408 --> 22:05.236
So think about it.I will.

22:05.280 --> 22:07.238
I should let you two
say goodbye.

22:12.287 --> 22:13.680
All right.

22:13.723 --> 22:15.421
Take care of my baby
while I'm gone.

22:16.465 --> 22:17.858
I'm gonna miss you.

22:17.901 --> 22:19.425
Back at you.

22:19.468 --> 22:22.297
Oh, what news
did you have for me?

22:22.341 --> 22:24.430
Don't worry about it.

22:24.473 --> 22:26.083
Just have fun in New York, okay?

22:26.127 --> 22:28.129
Take care of yourself.We'll talk later.

22:30.827 --> 22:34.744
I guess your sister wasn't in
the mood to meet your new wife.

22:37.051 --> 22:38.792
CRISTAL:
I knew it!

22:38.835 --> 22:41.142
I knew you were cheating
on me, Blake!

22:42.578 --> 22:44.624
NADIA: Oh,
Mrs. Carrington, I'm sorry!

22:44.667 --> 22:46.016
CRISTAL:
How could you?

22:46.060 --> 22:49.324
With the help?
Do you have no self-respect?

22:49.368 --> 22:52.240
How long has this been going on?
I want an explanation.

22:52.283 --> 22:54.416
BLAKE:
I don't need to explain myself.

22:54.460 --> 22:55.591
Then you explain.

22:55.635 --> 22:56.853
We've been sleeping
together for months.

22:56.897 --> 22:58.594
That's why I was hired.

22:58.638 --> 23:00.291
BLAKE : You're
just making things worse.

23:00.335 --> 23:01.423
CRISTAL:
Months?

23:01.467 --> 23:02.990
I thought you were
screwing Adam.

23:03.033 --> 23:05.384
No, I only slept with Adam
to make your husband jealous.

23:05.427 --> 23:06.820
I was using him.

23:06.863 --> 23:08.256
CRISTAL:
I want you out.

23:08.299 --> 23:10.171
Don't ever show your face
around here again.

23:14.175 --> 23:16.264
He's gone.

23:16.307 --> 23:18.571
I can't believe how well
that worked. Yay, us.

23:18.614 --> 23:20.834
Blake's TED Talk snippets
were very helpful.

23:20.877 --> 23:22.357
Well, I'm sure it's
the first time

23:22.401 --> 23:24.446
anyone's ever listened
to them. Nadia,

23:24.490 --> 23:26.753
nice performance,
but Cristal's right,

23:26.796 --> 23:28.798
we don't need to see you
around here ever again.

23:28.842 --> 23:31.497
I mean, your deviousness
was great when it was useful,

23:31.540 --> 23:33.150
but now I just
don't really trust you.

23:33.194 --> 23:35.588
I understand.

23:35.631 --> 23:38.417
Good doing business
with you, ladies.

23:39.635 --> 23:41.768
I hope this works

23:41.811 --> 23:44.118
and Blake finally sees Adam
for what he is.

23:44.161 --> 23:45.859
Oh, it'll work. I mean, Adam

23:45.902 --> 23:47.948
isn't exactly subtle
when he's upset.

23:47.991 --> 23:50.037
I mean, he usually snaps
in the craziest way possible,

23:50.080 --> 23:52.953
like, putting my face
on my mother.

24:30.860 --> 24:32.122
Blake?

24:32.166 --> 24:34.124
What are you doing here?You and I need to talk.

24:34.168 --> 24:36.518
About what? Have we
ever talked before?

24:36.562 --> 24:38.041
Don't play dumb.

24:38.085 --> 24:39.652
I know that you've
been talking to the FBI,

24:39.695 --> 24:41.131
you ungrateful little bitch.

24:41.175 --> 24:43.003
You've been nothing but
a parasite since you came back.

24:43.046 --> 24:45.005
I refuse to engage
with your negativity right now.

24:45.048 --> 24:47.529
Whatever you think...I don't want to hear a word
from you, all right?

24:47.573 --> 24:49.009
You are not testifying,

24:49.052 --> 24:51.664
and you are leaving town
immediately.

24:51.707 --> 24:53.709
Bought you a plane ticket
to Australia,

24:53.753 --> 24:55.842
but frankly,
I don't care where you go.

24:55.885 --> 24:57.713
You just stay away
from me and my family.

24:57.757 --> 24:59.410
Are you seriously
trying to banish me?

24:59.454 --> 25:01.282
I have no idea what
you're talking about.

25:01.325 --> 25:03.545
I have not been talking
to the FBI about you.Just stop. Just stop.

25:03.589 --> 25:04.851
Stop with the lies,
all right?

25:04.894 --> 25:06.287
If I hear you're ever back
in Atlanta again,

25:06.330 --> 25:07.375
we're gonna have a problem.

25:07.418 --> 25:08.855
Does my father know
about this?

25:08.898 --> 25:11.684
Yeah, Anders is the one
that told me about what you did.

25:11.727 --> 25:13.860
Everyone
wants you gone.

26:13.441 --> 26:15.617
Sir, when you've got a minute,
I've had a few thoughts

26:15.661 --> 26:18.620
about, um, how we should proceed
with our secret witness.

26:18.664 --> 26:20.274
Actually, I took care
of that last night.

26:20.317 --> 26:21.623
What do you mean?

26:21.667 --> 26:23.277
I thought we were going
to discuss this together.

26:23.320 --> 26:25.192
We were, but the more
I thought about it,

26:25.235 --> 26:26.846
the more I felt
that I had no choice.

26:26.889 --> 26:29.022
I gave Kirby a plane ticket
to Australia and I told her

26:29.065 --> 26:31.851
that she was no longer welcome
in the manor or in Atlanta.

26:31.894 --> 26:33.940
Look, I know this court case
is high stakes

26:33.983 --> 26:36.420
and that you may not be
in the best frame of mind,

26:36.464 --> 26:37.857
but exiling
my daughter...

26:37.900 --> 26:39.859
Look at what I did to Fallon
yesterday on the stand.

26:39.902 --> 26:41.556
Do you think I wanted
to do that? No.

26:41.600 --> 26:43.123
When we're talking
life and death,

26:43.166 --> 26:44.907
we need a firm hand
with our children.

26:44.951 --> 26:48.041
I didn't want you to have to do
it, so I took it upon myself.I see.

26:48.084 --> 26:51.522
Are we still good for your
testimony today as we discussed?

26:52.828 --> 26:53.829
Okay.

27:03.839 --> 27:05.667
D.A. Brown.

27:05.711 --> 27:08.931
This is Joseph Anders.

27:08.975 --> 27:10.846
Is the offer of immunity

27:10.890 --> 27:14.545
for testifying against Blake
Carrington still on the table?

27:25.861 --> 27:28.168
Is this the La Mirage
front desk?

27:28.211 --> 27:30.953
This is Beyoncé's assistant.

27:30.997 --> 27:33.608
Yes, that Beyoncé.

27:33.652 --> 27:36.829
We're considering your hotel
as a base for her upcoming tour.

27:36.872 --> 27:39.135
Of course, we'd need
to swing by to make sure

27:39.179 --> 27:42.704
everything meets
her very high standards.

27:42.748 --> 27:44.619
Lovely.

27:44.663 --> 27:46.795
I'll be right there.

27:49.276 --> 27:51.060
Sam.

27:51.104 --> 27:53.193
Sam, where are you going?Beyoncé's people

27:53.236 --> 27:54.716
are on their way
to my hotel,

27:54.760 --> 27:57.676
and I need to go make sure
everyone gets in formation.

27:57.719 --> 28:01.201
Oh, my God, I'm panicking.
How's my outfit?

28:01.244 --> 28:03.682
That's better. Hey, you wouldn't
mind if I take your spot?

28:03.725 --> 28:05.074
I'm dying to support
my brother.

28:05.118 --> 28:06.859
Do whatever you want,
I'm barely listening to you.

28:06.902 --> 28:09.513
Hey, she can
take my spot.

28:13.126 --> 28:17.478
I heard your premiere issue
is being delayed.

28:17.521 --> 28:18.740
Something about
a break-in?

28:18.784 --> 28:21.438
Yup. Someone must really
have it out for me.

28:21.482 --> 28:25.529
They deleted everything from our
hard drives and remote storage,

28:25.573 --> 28:27.009
including the first issue

28:27.053 --> 28:28.881
and the distribution list,
so now everything

28:28.924 --> 28:30.970
has to be recreated
from scratch.

28:31.013 --> 28:33.146
Well, that sounds terrible.

28:33.189 --> 28:36.236
Oh, save it.
You must be thrilled

28:36.279 --> 28:38.412
that we will not be able
to cover your trial

28:38.455 --> 28:40.327
in a fair and unbiased way.

28:40.370 --> 28:42.329
Well, I guess that means
that your temper tantrum

28:42.372 --> 28:43.852
won't be mentioned
either, right?

28:43.896 --> 28:45.985
That would've embarrassing
for you and your magazine.

28:46.028 --> 28:47.595
It's almost like
you planned this.

28:47.638 --> 28:49.640
Who would do such a thing?

28:49.684 --> 28:53.601
I would, which is how
I know you would.

28:53.644 --> 28:56.038
You're at least as smart
as I am, maybe smarter.

28:56.082 --> 28:58.867
Okay.

28:58.911 --> 29:00.782
Obvious facts aside,

29:00.826 --> 29:03.916
hypothetically, if I did have
something to do with this,

29:03.959 --> 29:05.656
it would be your fault

29:05.700 --> 29:08.442
because you made a fool of me
in court, and, hypothetically,

29:08.485 --> 29:10.923
not publishing
would be much better

29:10.966 --> 29:12.489
for my relationship with Liam.

29:12.533 --> 29:14.796
Well, color me
hypothetically impressed.

29:14.840 --> 29:16.145
Hmm? You poison

29:16.189 --> 29:18.234
your own well and then
you act like a victim?

29:18.278 --> 29:19.932
That's a classic
Carrington move.

29:19.975 --> 29:23.500
Admit it, huh, you're a regular
chip off the old Blake.

29:23.544 --> 29:25.807
Please never say that again.

29:25.851 --> 29:28.984
And also, unlike you,
I don't destroy family members,

29:29.028 --> 29:30.333
or control them.

29:30.377 --> 29:33.075
Don't sell yourself short.

29:33.119 --> 29:35.948
You sabotaged your own magazine,
you got Liam on a leash.

29:35.991 --> 29:37.776
You could be savage
when you need to be.

29:37.819 --> 29:40.343
Sometimes,
you're more me than me.

29:40.387 --> 29:42.258
And you know what?

29:42.302 --> 29:44.478
I'm proud of you.

30:15.335 --> 30:17.380
We know that Mac
disappeared on March 15,

30:17.424 --> 30:19.165
which matches
the coroner's reports.

30:19.208 --> 30:20.340
Where were you
that night?

30:20.383 --> 30:21.994
At the manor, as usual.

30:22.037 --> 30:24.866
BROWN: As the majordomo,
would you say that you are privy

30:24.910 --> 30:27.695
to everything that goes on
in the household?

30:27.738 --> 30:30.393
Well, there's not much that
happens that I don't know about.

30:30.437 --> 30:34.049
Did you see Mac at the manor
the day he disappeared?

30:38.793 --> 30:40.012
Yes.

30:41.361 --> 30:43.363
Is your butler betraying Blake?

30:43.406 --> 30:44.886
Why was he there?

30:44.930 --> 30:48.890
Mac had botched a job
that Blake had hired him to do,

30:48.934 --> 30:50.849
so Blake asked him
to come to the manor

30:50.892 --> 30:52.676
to punish him.

30:52.720 --> 30:54.026
BROWN: Would you describe
Blake's attitude

30:54.069 --> 30:57.203
going into this meeting
as intense?

30:57.246 --> 30:59.596
Possibly ready to kill?

30:59.640 --> 31:00.771
Objection, Your Honor.

31:00.815 --> 31:02.991
Calls for speculation.Sustained.

31:03.035 --> 31:05.515
Objection,
you skanky bitch!

31:05.559 --> 31:08.257
How dare you accuse
my dear brother of such a thing!

31:08.301 --> 31:10.346
Our father is rolling over
in his grave.

31:10.390 --> 31:11.652
I don't know who you are,

31:11.695 --> 31:13.480
but you need to stop attacking
the prosecutor.

31:13.523 --> 31:15.351
Your Honor,
I'm Dominique Deveraux,

31:15.395 --> 31:16.744
sister of the defendant.

31:16.787 --> 31:17.963
May I approach the bench?

31:18.006 --> 31:20.661
You may do no such thing.
Mr. Carrington,

31:20.704 --> 31:23.011
please get your
family under control.

31:23.055 --> 31:24.752
This is not a good look for you.

31:24.795 --> 31:26.928
Are you going to let them
drag me out of here? Blake!

31:26.972 --> 31:28.712
I need my purse.
Skank, skank, skank!

31:28.756 --> 31:32.064
Prosecution,
please, continue.

31:32.107 --> 31:34.283
So what happened
when Mac arrived?

31:36.459 --> 31:38.026
Uh, I'm sorry, sir.
I-I...

31:38.070 --> 31:40.289
I can't lie anymore.

31:41.638 --> 31:44.772
Blake was very angry
when Mac arrived,

31:44.815 --> 31:46.730
and he threatened him
and his family.

31:46.774 --> 31:47.993
They had a

31:48.036 --> 31:50.778
physical altercation.
I had to intervene.

31:50.821 --> 31:52.911
I took Mac outside
to cool off;

31:52.954 --> 31:55.391
and that's when he attacked me.

31:55.435 --> 31:56.479
I fought back,

31:56.523 --> 31:57.959
but Mac was unbalanced.

31:58.003 --> 31:59.265
He was a killer.

31:59.308 --> 32:02.094
And is this when Mr. Carrington
came outside?

32:02.137 --> 32:04.183
No-- So, um, the truth is,

32:04.226 --> 32:05.271
um...

32:05.314 --> 32:09.101
I got the jump on Mac, and...

32:09.144 --> 32:10.450
I killed him.

32:13.018 --> 32:14.149
In self-defense.

32:14.193 --> 32:15.585
BROWN: But Mr. Anders,
you are under oath.

32:15.629 --> 32:17.239
This is not the testimony
that we expected.

32:17.283 --> 32:18.588
Objection.
Your Honor,

32:18.632 --> 32:20.025
the D.A. is badgering
the witness.

32:20.068 --> 32:21.374
How am I badgering the witness?Order!

32:21.417 --> 32:24.333
Order! Order.

32:24.377 --> 32:26.596
Everyone, quiet.

32:26.640 --> 32:28.990
Mr. Anders?
I would remind you

32:29.034 --> 32:31.514
perjury is
a serious crime.

32:31.558 --> 32:33.429
I stand by my testimony.

32:34.735 --> 32:37.520
JUDGE:
Then I'm calling
for a brief recess.

32:37.564 --> 32:40.175
We'll reconvene
in the afternoon.

33:25.351 --> 33:27.048
The D.A. was none too pleased.
And the judge was distraught

33:27.092 --> 33:29.659
that she couldn't charge me
right there for Mac's murder.

33:29.703 --> 33:32.010
Well, nothing you said
could be used against you.

33:32.053 --> 33:34.316
Who would've thought
the prosecution offering you

33:34.360 --> 33:36.710
an immunity deal
would be a good thing?

33:36.753 --> 33:40.366
Well, it helps that we
could use it against them.

33:40.409 --> 33:43.195
And you calling them
last minute, that was perfect.

33:43.238 --> 33:46.763
No prep. They assumed
that you would turn on me.

33:46.807 --> 33:49.288
Yeah. There's no way
they can convict me now.

33:49.331 --> 33:52.508
Especially with their secret
witness being taken care of.

33:52.552 --> 33:54.771
Hey.
We won, Anders.

33:56.469 --> 33:57.513
Both of us.

33:57.557 --> 34:00.125
Hmm. Indeed.

34:00.168 --> 34:04.042
Though I'm not
entirely happy.

34:06.131 --> 34:08.089
Because of Kirby.

34:08.133 --> 34:10.526
Yes.

34:10.570 --> 34:12.876
I have to admit I
had a moment of doubt.

34:12.920 --> 34:15.575
But I've always looked
on you as my son.

34:15.618 --> 34:19.100
I couldn't allow them
to put you in prison.

34:19.144 --> 34:21.407
Your father did the same thing
for me when I was younger.

34:21.450 --> 34:24.236
Almost Dickensian,
really.

34:24.279 --> 34:25.976
But Kirby's my child, too.

34:26.020 --> 34:28.675
I don't want to have to
choose between my children.

34:28.718 --> 34:30.938
I see.

34:30.981 --> 34:32.418
She made a mistake.

34:32.461 --> 34:35.203
And yes, we have a duty
to be firm with our children,

34:35.247 --> 34:40.121
but we also have a duty to
give them unconditional love.

34:40.165 --> 34:42.254
You've forgiven
Fallon many times.

34:42.297 --> 34:43.951
Yeah.

34:43.994 --> 34:45.953
Maybe I went too far.

34:45.996 --> 34:47.433
Why don't you bring Kirby back?

34:47.476 --> 34:49.130
She can even stay
in the manor again.

34:49.174 --> 34:52.133
And if there's any issue
with dodging a subpoena,

34:52.177 --> 34:54.614
we'll have my legal team
take care of it.

34:57.182 --> 34:59.793
Yeah, I'm gonna leave you to it.

34:59.836 --> 35:00.794
And Anders?

35:00.837 --> 35:02.796
Thank you.

35:12.153 --> 35:13.415
Kirby, this is your father.

35:13.459 --> 35:16.201
I just rang to say I'm sorry.

35:16.244 --> 35:18.246
Come back. Please.

35:19.943 --> 35:21.423
I'm trending and a meme.

35:21.467 --> 35:22.859
Everyone is obsessed

35:22.903 --> 35:24.600
with the sister who
attacked the prosecutor

35:24.644 --> 35:25.993
because she loves her
murderous brother

35:26.036 --> 35:28.038
that much.What's your next trick gonna be?

35:28.082 --> 35:29.388
Breaking him out of prison?

35:29.431 --> 35:31.738
Ha! I wouldn't rule it out.

35:31.781 --> 35:34.349
But now Hot Tea Atlanta
wants to do this

35:34.393 --> 35:37.091
"Making of a Murderer's Sister"
profile on me,

35:37.135 --> 35:39.006
and they're going to follow me
around court this afternoon.

35:39.049 --> 35:41.487
You should come.I've been thinking, Mom,

35:41.530 --> 35:45.143
and I would rather do this
without your antics.

35:45.186 --> 35:47.319
Antics?
I'm doing this for you.

35:47.362 --> 35:48.842
You're doing this for yourself.

35:48.885 --> 35:50.626
And honestly,

35:50.670 --> 35:53.020
I don't even feel like
I can trust you anymore.

35:53.063 --> 35:55.196
Not after what you pulled
with Jeff and Monica.

35:55.240 --> 35:57.938
Vanessa.
I've always seen you

35:57.981 --> 36:01.333
as more my child than anyone.

36:01.376 --> 36:03.857
There's so much of me in you.

36:03.900 --> 36:06.512
My singing career may
have died on the vine,

36:06.555 --> 36:10.080
but I would give up everything
to make sure you succeed.

36:10.124 --> 36:12.605
I think it's best
if I leave for a bit.

36:14.259 --> 36:15.999
Monica invited me to New York.

36:16.043 --> 36:17.523
And I'm going with her.

36:17.566 --> 36:19.177
But what about the empire
I'm building?

36:19.220 --> 36:20.917
It's nothing if
you're not here.

36:20.961 --> 36:23.529
I got to pack.

36:28.403 --> 36:30.362
Hey.

36:30.405 --> 36:32.755
I was reading that?Yes. But.

36:32.799 --> 36:35.584
I, uh, I may have
done something crazy.

36:35.628 --> 36:37.586
Okay, does this have
anything to do with

36:37.630 --> 36:38.848
the break-in at the magazine?

36:38.892 --> 36:41.547
Or why the first part
of my article

36:41.590 --> 36:43.984
isn't getting published?Well, why would
you think that?

36:45.420 --> 36:47.030
I mean, yes,
it's-it's true.

36:47.074 --> 36:48.641
It's just, I don't appreciate
that it was your first guess,

36:48.684 --> 36:50.033
but that's not the point.

36:50.077 --> 36:52.775
The point is, I have
learned my lesson.

36:52.819 --> 36:56.126
Wow. Only youcould
spin something this insane

36:56.170 --> 36:58.085
into a positive.No-no-no-no-no,

36:58.128 --> 37:00.174
it's genuine.
My eyes have been opened.

37:00.218 --> 37:02.350
I realized I am too much
like my father.

37:02.394 --> 37:04.265
Which is not a good thing.
I mean, look at him.

37:04.309 --> 37:05.397
The man is a hop, skip,

37:05.440 --> 37:06.963
and a guilty verdict away
from prison.

37:07.007 --> 37:08.443
Okay, well, your learning
a valuable lesson

37:08.487 --> 37:10.184
doesn't negate the crazy
that you just put me through.

37:10.228 --> 37:11.490
No, no, no, I know, I know.

37:11.533 --> 37:13.535
That's why, from now on,

37:13.579 --> 37:16.582
I am making a conscious
effort to be better.

37:17.626 --> 37:19.367
Maybe start with an apology?

37:19.411 --> 37:21.108
Yes.

37:22.457 --> 37:24.807
Um... look, I, uh, I know

37:24.851 --> 37:26.287
that I have a flare
for the dramatic,

37:26.331 --> 37:27.854
and I can crush
with an iron fist

37:27.897 --> 37:30.117
when I should be handling
with a velvet glove;

37:30.160 --> 37:31.466
but that stops now.

37:31.510 --> 37:34.295
Okay? And I am sorry
if I drove you crazy.

37:34.339 --> 37:35.688
Thank you.

37:35.731 --> 37:37.907
Actually...

37:37.951 --> 37:39.996
there is someone else

37:40.040 --> 37:41.607
I should be saying this to

37:41.650 --> 37:43.565
on my journey to becoming
a better person.

37:43.609 --> 37:45.088
Because he certainly
never will be.

37:45.132 --> 37:46.438
What did you do now?

37:46.481 --> 37:48.483
Julia? Where's Adam?

37:48.527 --> 37:50.355
I haven't seen him
since last night,

37:50.398 --> 37:51.530
but Ms. Carrington?

37:51.573 --> 37:53.619
We just got a call
from the caretaker.

37:53.662 --> 37:54.881
The vineyard is on fire.

37:55.925 --> 37:57.840
Oh, my God. Adam.

38:02.410 --> 38:06.153
SAM:
Hey. Got your text that
you're leaving with Joel.

38:06.196 --> 38:08.416
You weren't gonna run off
without saying bye, were you?

38:08.460 --> 38:10.940
I didn't think you were here.
I thought you were in court.

38:10.984 --> 38:13.856
Long, confusing story, but let's
just say Beyoncé's assistant

38:13.900 --> 38:16.555
is on a yacht with the
Obamas and not calling me.

38:16.598 --> 38:18.644
Anyway, why'd you
change your mind?

38:18.687 --> 38:20.080
What about being
here for your dad?

38:20.123 --> 38:24.214
Oh. My dad's gone
full paranoid crazy.

38:24.258 --> 38:27.087
He thinks I'm some sort of
secret witness in Blake's trial.

38:27.130 --> 38:28.958
Wait.
Anders thinks you're what?

38:29.002 --> 38:31.178
Don't even ask,
because I barely understand.

38:31.221 --> 38:34.312
I mean...
the FBI was contacting me,

38:34.355 --> 38:36.444
but it wasn't about Blake,
it was about Joel.

38:36.488 --> 38:38.664
I knew that guy
was a problem.

38:38.707 --> 38:39.839
You know what? Maybe
you shouldn't go.

38:39.882 --> 38:41.406
Oh-- Oh, no, no-no.

38:41.449 --> 38:42.929
It's just about stupid stuff,

38:42.972 --> 38:44.496
like some
misfiled tax liability.

38:44.539 --> 38:46.324
It's not a big deal.Oh, yeah, but what if

38:46.367 --> 38:49.457
Joel's lying? I mean, you can't
spell "fib" without F-B-I.

38:49.501 --> 38:51.503
What?

38:51.546 --> 38:53.200
Oh. That's Joel.

38:53.243 --> 38:55.463
I'll probably see you
in a few days.

38:55.507 --> 38:57.465
Okay. Have fun.
Be careful.

38:57.509 --> 38:58.771
And don't forget to call me.

38:58.814 --> 39:01.251
Or I'll be worried.

39:04.559 --> 39:06.692
Oh, my God, Adam?

39:06.735 --> 39:09.085
Fallon? What-what...
what are you doing here?

39:09.129 --> 39:11.523
I am so sorry.
This is all my fault.

39:11.566 --> 39:14.134
What do you mean?Um...

39:14.177 --> 39:17.529
well, it all started
when I paid Nadia

39:17.572 --> 39:19.400
to make you fall in love
with her.

39:19.444 --> 39:21.402
And then I staged
a fake fight,

39:21.446 --> 39:23.099
with Cristal's help,
to make it look like

39:23.143 --> 39:25.406
Blake had sex with Nadia.Wait, wait, wait, wait.

39:25.450 --> 39:26.712
So that's not true.

39:26.755 --> 39:28.931
I, I just...

39:32.065 --> 39:33.066
I just burned down
Father's vineyard!

39:33.109 --> 39:35.155
Well, maybe
it's salvageable.
Uh--

39:35.198 --> 39:36.243
How could you
do this to me?

39:36.286 --> 39:37.897
I'm at my most
vulnerable.

39:37.940 --> 39:39.551
I'm gonna make it up
to you, okay?

39:39.594 --> 39:41.379
I will buy us
a new vineyard.

39:41.422 --> 39:44.904
I'm already blind! And
now I'm heartbroken, too?

39:44.947 --> 39:47.385
I know, and I'm so sorry, but...

39:49.082 --> 39:50.910
Wait, how did you get up here?

39:50.953 --> 39:53.956
And how were you able
to set fire to the vineyard

39:54.000 --> 39:55.305
if you can't see?

39:55.349 --> 39:58.134
I'm very capable
with my cane.

40:02.356 --> 40:05.925
I knew it.
I knew that you could see.

40:05.968 --> 40:07.753
How dare you try
and just manipulate me

40:07.796 --> 40:09.450
when I am being sincere
in my apology!

40:09.494 --> 40:12.453
Well, you made me
burn down a vineyard!

40:12.497 --> 40:16.109
FALLON:
You have been faking
the whole time, haven't you?

40:16.152 --> 40:18.764
ADAM:
No. That's something
youwould do!

40:20.809 --> 40:23.116
You.

40:23.159 --> 40:25.510
It was you that hit me
over the head.What?

40:25.553 --> 40:26.685
I remember everything now.

40:26.728 --> 40:27.947
You hit me
over the head!Whoa, whoa. Hey.

40:27.990 --> 40:29.992
I nearly died!Hey, hey.
Calm down.

40:30.036 --> 40:32.473
It looks like your amnesia
is turning into insanity.

40:32.517 --> 40:33.648
You're unbelievable.

40:33.692 --> 40:35.215

a plea deal, Mr. Carrington.

making this offer

40:52.711 --> 40:55.191

Mr. Carrington's guilt.
