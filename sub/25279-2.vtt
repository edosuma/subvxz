WEBVTT

00:09.009 --> 00:10.301
[knocking at door]

00:13.054 --> 00:15.974
What... Colt!
Come on, it's 1:00 in the morning.

00:16.057 --> 00:18.560
My roommate's gone.
You scared me.

00:18.643 --> 00:20.311
I couldn't find my mace.
If you were a robber,

00:20.395 --> 00:23.022
I'd have to spray you
with I Can't Believe It's Not Butter!

00:24.816 --> 00:25.734
Pack your bags.

00:25.817 --> 00:28.361
-What?
-We're going to Mexico.

00:28.445 --> 00:29.362
[sighs]

00:29.446 --> 00:31.698
Get your swimsuit,
your sunscreen and cigarettes.

00:31.781 --> 00:33.158
That's like cash there.

00:35.243 --> 00:36.369
That's prison.

00:36.995 --> 00:37.829
Get in here.

00:37.912 --> 00:38.830
What are you talking about?

00:38.913 --> 00:41.291
I'm talking about just starting over.

00:41.374 --> 00:43.293
Ab, what's keeping us here?

00:44.002 --> 00:46.713
Our jobs, our family,
our friends, our lives.

00:46.796 --> 00:48.673
I'm talking about stuff that matters.

00:50.633 --> 00:53.470
Abby, this is our chance to start fresh.

00:53.553 --> 00:56.056
We can go anywhere.
We could do anything.

00:56.139 --> 00:58.183
We could be different people.

00:58.266 --> 01:01.853
I'll be Frank from Tuscaloosa.
You'll be Helen from Tuscaloosa.

01:02.729 --> 01:05.940
Um, Colt, how do I say this?

01:06.024 --> 01:08.109
You sound like a fucking whackjob.

01:08.610 --> 01:10.320
Okay? I start school tomorrow.

01:10.403 --> 01:12.155
-I should be sleeping.
-Yeah.

01:12.238 --> 01:13.948
What is going on?

01:17.577 --> 01:18.953
The pipeline fell through.

01:20.371 --> 01:21.956
Jesus Christ.

01:22.040 --> 01:24.459
Right after we bought the Peterson ranch.

01:25.043 --> 01:28.004
Look, look. None of that matters.

01:28.880 --> 01:31.216
This is our chance
to start our life together.

01:31.841 --> 01:34.052
Helen from Tuscaloosa...

01:34.636 --> 01:35.512
roll tide!

01:36.888 --> 01:40.642
You always do this.
You can't keep running from your problems.

01:41.559 --> 01:44.312
I disagree,
but we can talk about it on the road.

01:45.271 --> 01:46.689
Colt, stop.

01:46.773 --> 01:47.774
Stop what?

01:49.359 --> 01:53.404
My family hates me,
'cause I ruined their fucking lives.

01:55.031 --> 01:58.284
You hate me
'cause I'm not a supportive boyfriend.

01:58.368 --> 02:01.329
And, to top it off, on the way here,
Waze took me on a toll road.

02:01.412 --> 02:04.499
I didn't have change,
so I threw Life Savers in it.

02:04.582 --> 02:05.792
That'll go on my record.

02:05.875 --> 02:09.212
If I ever get car insurance,
it'll be fucking expensive.

02:11.381 --> 02:13.508
Colt, come on. I...

02:14.008 --> 02:16.511
I don't hate you, okay?

02:17.095 --> 02:19.139
And your family will come around.

02:19.931 --> 02:21.641
And you need to get insurance.

02:23.518 --> 02:24.602
Come on.

02:26.688 --> 02:27.730
Sit down.

02:31.401 --> 02:32.360
[Abby sighs]

02:33.862 --> 02:35.029
Okay. I...

02:36.239 --> 02:38.533
I know you're freaking out.

02:38.616 --> 02:41.035
I get it. A lot of shit has happened.

02:41.536 --> 02:43.204
But we'll figure it out.

02:44.956 --> 02:45.915
How?

02:47.208 --> 02:49.210
[sighs] I don't know.

02:49.294 --> 02:52.505
But I know the solution
isn't going to Mexico.

02:56.092 --> 02:57.510
Yeah, you're right.

03:01.180 --> 03:03.975
I'm sorry for coming
and dumping this on you.

03:05.643 --> 03:09.480
Yeah, it is not the best time, but...

03:11.149 --> 03:12.609
we're a team, right?

03:12.692 --> 03:14.736
-[Colt sighs]
-Frank and Helen.

03:16.362 --> 03:18.907
Let's go to bed.
We'll talk about it in the morning.

03:20.950 --> 03:21.951
All right.

03:25.622 --> 03:26.456
Thank you.

03:29.083 --> 03:30.877
You're right about the car insurance.

03:31.836 --> 03:34.756
That's something I can fix.
I'll call The General in the morning.

03:36.549 --> 03:37.759
Come here.

03:38.384 --> 03:39.260
[Abby chuckles]

03:41.596 --> 03:43.598
[theme song playing]

04:55.461 --> 04:57.380
-Hey.
-Hey.

05:02.635 --> 05:03.970
Should you be drinking?

05:04.721 --> 05:07.432
I just like the feel of it in my hand.

05:11.060 --> 05:12.312
[Maggie sighs]

05:21.946 --> 05:24.365
It is quiet in here without that buzz.

05:27.118 --> 05:28.703
How could those be our boys?

05:31.289 --> 05:33.833
Would it help if I pretended
they weren't yours?

05:34.417 --> 05:35.335
Very much.

05:37.879 --> 05:40.548
They're certainly not
who I thought we raised.

05:41.632 --> 05:43.801
I thought they were better than this.

05:45.845 --> 05:48.389
You remember their first T-ball game?

05:49.682 --> 05:51.642
When we said if they got a hit,

05:52.518 --> 05:54.437
we'd buy them a snow cone?

05:56.564 --> 06:00.443
And they didn't get a hit,
but we bought 'em snow cones anyway?

06:01.736 --> 06:04.322
Pretty sure that's where
it all went wrong.

06:06.616 --> 06:09.118
You think if we hadn't
gone to Tastee Freez,

06:09.202 --> 06:12.455
we'd be talking about Doctor Colt
and Senator Rooster?

06:13.998 --> 06:15.083
I don't know.

06:15.583 --> 06:18.503
I'd never have done
anything like this to my dad.

06:20.963 --> 06:23.424
Nobody's defended them more than I have.

06:24.509 --> 06:27.845
Maybe it's time to stop
looking for what we did wrong.

06:27.929 --> 06:30.431
They're grown men.
This is on them.

06:34.477 --> 06:36.395
This is a fucking mess, Mags.

06:36.979 --> 06:39.065
-Yeah.
-Two mortgages and no money.

06:40.650 --> 06:43.402
If we were closer to market,
we'd have a slim chance,

06:43.486 --> 06:46.656
but there's no way we'll keep
our heads above water through this.

06:47.532 --> 06:50.243
-There's gotta be something we can do.
-Yeah.

06:50.326 --> 06:53.746
Stock up on ammo
for when the bankers show up.

06:55.957 --> 06:59.252
So, what? You just gonna give up?

06:59.836 --> 07:01.254
Even if there was a miracle,

07:01.337 --> 07:03.714
we'll still end up leaving the ranch
to the boys.

07:03.798 --> 07:05.133
What's the point?

07:05.716 --> 07:07.385
They're just gonna fuck it up.

07:08.678 --> 07:10.054
There's a silver lining.

07:10.638 --> 07:11.848
What would that be?

07:11.931 --> 07:13.808
Well, when that happens,

07:13.891 --> 07:15.059
we'll be dead.

07:17.103 --> 07:18.938
I gotta get some sleep.

07:19.021 --> 07:21.816
-You gonna be all right?
-Yeah, I'm fine.

07:38.666 --> 07:39.667
[door closes]

07:59.979 --> 08:03.691
Colt always pulls this shit.
Creates a mess and I gotta clean it up.

08:03.774 --> 08:05.067
Know what? Fuck him.

08:05.151 --> 08:07.862
You know,
there's two sides to every story.

08:08.613 --> 08:12.241
Hey, Maria, I'll take another round
for my friend. On me.

08:13.367 --> 08:14.702
Like I was saying,

08:14.785 --> 08:16.162
fuck Colt.

08:17.538 --> 08:19.332
[woman] You know what? I'm with Colt.

08:20.333 --> 08:21.918
Why don't you mind your own...

08:23.044 --> 08:23.961
Oh, hello.

08:25.922 --> 08:28.174
-I'm Rooster.
-I'm Megan.

08:31.427 --> 08:33.513
Okay, apparently we're done talkin'.

08:35.890 --> 08:39.101
-How long have you been here?
-'Bout two and a half Buds.

08:39.185 --> 08:42.647
Oh! You tell time by beer, too, huh?
[chuckles]

08:42.730 --> 08:46.192
If you know what day of the week it is
by how much Kodiak is left in your tin,

08:46.275 --> 08:47.276
we might be soul mates.

08:47.360 --> 08:48.236
[chuckles]

08:48.736 --> 08:52.323
So, you just gonna sit there,
or will you buy me a half hour?

08:53.908 --> 08:56.410
My mom owns this place,
so we drink for free.

08:57.245 --> 09:01.207
Also, anything left in the lost and found
for 30 days, it's mine.

09:02.959 --> 09:03.793
Cool brag.

09:05.545 --> 09:06.587
Is that how you got that shirt?

09:07.713 --> 09:11.425
Uh, no, I used to date a girl
who works in the morgue.

09:11.509 --> 09:14.136
Anytime a medium-sized guy died,
she'd hook me up.

09:15.263 --> 09:18.724
This guy... went hunting, froze to death.

09:22.311 --> 09:23.604
Another cool brag.

09:25.731 --> 09:30.403
So, since you're obviously new to town,
if you want, I can show you the sights.

09:31.070 --> 09:33.864
We've got a... town hall

09:33.948 --> 09:36.826
and a Dairy Queen,
where, if you know who to ask,

09:36.909 --> 09:38.369
they'll sell you some firecrackers.

09:39.203 --> 09:42.665
And you've already seen the number one
tourist attraction in town.

09:44.166 --> 09:45.001
My beard.

09:45.084 --> 09:46.627
[laughs]

09:47.420 --> 09:51.215
It is a pretty good beard.
I'll have to take a picture with it later.

09:52.216 --> 09:53.092
Later?

09:53.175 --> 09:55.595
Well, this day's just got a lot better.

09:56.220 --> 09:59.223
So, Megan, what brings you to Garrison?

09:59.307 --> 10:01.392
I've been protesting the pipeline.

10:04.270 --> 10:07.815
-Seriously?
-Yeah, and we actually stopped it.

10:09.066 --> 10:11.944
You fucked up a lot of people's lives
with that protest.

10:12.528 --> 10:15.072
We stopped an oil company
from fucking up the environment.

10:15.906 --> 10:18.659
A lot of ranchers here were depending
on that money.

10:19.577 --> 10:21.662
It's our land.
You can't tell us what to do with it.

10:22.246 --> 10:24.248
I can when it affects my planet.

10:25.583 --> 10:30.421
I've heard guys talk about a hot chick
who was too annoying to hook up with.

10:30.963 --> 10:32.673
Never believed it until this minute.

10:33.966 --> 10:35.134
I'm so disappointed.

10:35.718 --> 10:39.472
I'll miss out on 90 seconds
of passion and two weeks of antibiotics.

10:42.516 --> 10:44.435
-You ride a bike?
-I ride a Harley.

10:48.856 --> 10:50.441
Fuck, we were soul mates.

10:52.026 --> 10:53.027
You believe that shit?

10:53.110 --> 10:55.571
Look who wants to hang out now.

11:16.092 --> 11:19.011
-You okay?
-Yeah, I was just...

11:20.930 --> 11:21.847
I'm fine.

11:25.351 --> 11:26.352
You sure?

11:27.395 --> 11:28.270
Yeah, I was just...

11:28.354 --> 11:31.065
thinking about the first day
of school and...

11:33.943 --> 11:35.319
Yeah, I get it.

11:37.863 --> 11:39.198
I was thinking all night.

11:40.991 --> 11:42.076
You were right.

11:43.994 --> 11:45.996
I should've never gone
behind my dad's back.

11:46.080 --> 11:47.081
Yeah.

11:49.792 --> 11:53.963
I kept hearing that voice in my head
that makes me do stupid things.

11:54.797 --> 11:56.257
"Colt, buy a ranch."

11:57.383 --> 12:00.386
-"Colt, frost your tips. It'll look rad."
-[chuckles]

12:00.970 --> 12:04.890
"Colt, of course you can ride down
a double black diamond on a garbage lid."

12:06.684 --> 12:09.103
You would've been fine
if there was snow on the ground.

12:09.186 --> 12:11.105
[both chuckle]

12:12.148 --> 12:15.109
You take chances.
That's what I love about you.

12:15.693 --> 12:16.861
Maybe you should've...

12:18.070 --> 12:20.739
-let the ranch go, but...
-[scoffs]

12:20.823 --> 12:22.116
you're in it now.

12:22.616 --> 12:23.451
Yeah.

12:23.534 --> 12:26.245
-You know you gotta go home, right?
-I know.

12:29.665 --> 12:31.625
All right. [groans]

12:35.713 --> 12:37.006
You gonna come with me?

12:37.089 --> 12:40.176
Dad might not shoot me
if you walk in the door first.

12:40.259 --> 12:42.470
I'm not gonna be your human shield.

12:42.553 --> 12:44.054
Yeah, well...

12:44.805 --> 12:46.390
you're too short, anyway.

12:46.474 --> 12:49.351
-[Abby chuckles]
-[groans]

12:49.435 --> 12:51.770
Thanks for being there for me.

12:52.646 --> 12:54.106
You wanna talk about us?

12:55.065 --> 12:56.901
What? No. I mean, we're good.

12:56.984 --> 12:59.904
You got enough on your plate
without worrying about anything else.

12:59.987 --> 13:00.905
Yeah.

13:03.240 --> 13:04.074
Thank you.

13:08.078 --> 13:09.038
All right.

13:09.830 --> 13:11.457
When will I see you again?

13:11.957 --> 13:14.585
What? This weekend. It's Easter.

13:14.668 --> 13:15.753
Ah, shit.

13:16.712 --> 13:18.547
Your parents are coming for dinner.

13:18.631 --> 13:21.509
-Yeah.
-Fuck, forgot I gave up cursing for Lent.

13:23.969 --> 13:25.054
Starting now.

13:25.137 --> 13:26.347
[Abby chuckles]

13:29.391 --> 13:30.726
It's gonna be great.

13:30.809 --> 13:32.436
Your parents hate you.

13:32.520 --> 13:34.480
My parents aren't big fans.

13:34.563 --> 13:36.482
It'll be more like the Last Supper.

13:38.817 --> 13:41.570
-Didn't Jesus die after that?
-Uh-huh.

13:44.240 --> 13:46.534
I'm messing with you.
It'll be fine.

13:49.411 --> 13:50.246
Hey, Ab?

13:51.956 --> 13:52.790
Yeah?

13:54.833 --> 13:57.336
If any of them kids
give you trouble today,

13:58.045 --> 13:59.338
you send 'em my way.

14:00.089 --> 14:01.757
I gave up swearing,

14:01.840 --> 14:03.008
not hitting children.

14:06.428 --> 14:07.429
All right.

14:10.558 --> 14:11.392
Colt, wait.

14:14.478 --> 14:15.312
What?

14:16.814 --> 14:17.773
I love you.

14:17.856 --> 14:18.816
I love you, too.

14:21.527 --> 14:22.695
All right.

14:22.778 --> 14:23.946
[groans]

14:24.530 --> 14:26.365
Son of a biscuit.

14:27.700 --> 14:29.618
Mother frosted tips.

14:38.836 --> 14:39.879
Maggie?

14:40.462 --> 14:42.756
-Mornin'.
-What are you doing here?

14:42.840 --> 14:45.718
Trying to figure out
if this is coffee or motor oil.

14:46.844 --> 14:48.971
If it's brown and hot,
what more do you want?

14:49.054 --> 14:49.930
This isn't Europe.

14:52.850 --> 14:57.605
So, I cleaned out all the water troughs,
replaced the mineral blocks in the field.

14:57.688 --> 15:01.609
Also, found a sick yearling,
so I put her in the barn.

15:01.692 --> 15:04.820
Rooster was being annoying,
so I put him in there, too.

15:05.946 --> 15:09.491
-You don't have to do this.
-Yeah, I do.

15:09.575 --> 15:10.910
You can't work.

15:10.993 --> 15:14.413
And you can't hire hands.
And your sons are idiots.

15:14.496 --> 15:15.873
What choice do we have?

15:15.956 --> 15:17.625
-Maggie...
-No.

15:17.708 --> 15:20.586
I'm not gonna sit back
and watch this place die.

15:20.669 --> 15:23.505
So, you'll break your back
over a lost cause?

15:24.173 --> 15:28.177
You've spent your whole life here
and I've spent most of mine.

15:28.260 --> 15:29.929
I won't let you walk away.

15:30.012 --> 15:33.057
We've been through blizzards,
droughts, diseases.

15:33.140 --> 15:34.934
Eight years of Bill Clinton.

15:37.561 --> 15:39.104
See, you're a survivor.

15:40.272 --> 15:41.106
Look, Beau...

15:41.857 --> 15:43.943
just 'cause you don't see
a way out of this,

15:44.026 --> 15:45.736
doesn't mean we stop trying to find one.

15:47.154 --> 15:49.949
If we go down,
it's not gonna be without a fight.

15:50.032 --> 15:51.367
We're the fucking Bennetts.

15:52.493 --> 15:53.327
I'll go with you.

15:54.286 --> 15:55.871
You're not going anywhere.

15:56.372 --> 15:58.207
You're still sitting on your ass.

15:58.290 --> 15:59.792
Like Bill Clinton.

16:01.794 --> 16:03.420
Thank you, Mags.

16:04.755 --> 16:06.131
I'll be back at 11:00.

16:06.632 --> 16:08.133
My lunch better be ready.

16:09.426 --> 16:11.679
Your heart's recovering, not your hands.

16:17.810 --> 16:19.645
[chuckles]

16:19.728 --> 16:22.815
This Beretta's sure got
a little giddy-up to it.

16:24.900 --> 16:26.276
Why are you selling it?

16:26.986 --> 16:31.657
What's gonna be left for the government
to pry out of your cold, dead hands?

16:32.658 --> 16:33.909
I got no choice.

16:33.993 --> 16:36.453
I'm selling everything
that isn't bolted down.

16:36.537 --> 16:38.372
[Dale sighs]

16:40.207 --> 16:43.877
I can't believe your boys
went behind your back that way.

16:43.961 --> 16:48.716
The same kids that, one Halloween,
dressed up like little Beau Bennetts

16:48.799 --> 16:50.759
and wouldn't even take any candy.

16:50.843 --> 16:53.012
They said it was a damn handout.

16:55.097 --> 16:58.434
Same year they beat up
a kid who was dressed like an astronaut.

16:58.517 --> 17:02.521
Then they told him the space program
is a waste of government resources.

17:02.604 --> 17:03.981
[both chuckle]

17:08.027 --> 17:09.611
I'm sorry about all this.

17:09.695 --> 17:11.113
Yeah, hell.

17:11.196 --> 17:12.072
I mean...

17:12.573 --> 17:15.826
The last thing
your heart needs is more stress.

17:15.909 --> 17:17.286
My heart's fine.

17:18.370 --> 17:21.832
I suppose I should thank you
for being an annoying old fart,

17:21.915 --> 17:24.668
for pushing me to go get checked out.

17:25.252 --> 17:28.630
Anytime that I can be annoying to you,
it's a pleasure.

17:30.340 --> 17:33.135
Then you must be living
on fucking cloud nine.

17:34.928 --> 17:37.139
How's the herd at the Peterson ranch?

17:37.222 --> 17:41.643
About what you'd expect for a man
who's laid up with brain cancer.

17:41.727 --> 17:43.979
Sure as hell don't look like your herd.

17:44.063 --> 17:45.147
[Beau] Yeah.

17:46.482 --> 17:48.817
I appreciate you checking 'em out.

17:48.901 --> 17:51.737
-What do I owe you?
-Not a thing.

17:51.820 --> 17:55.324
It's a new herd,
so the first inspection's free.

17:55.908 --> 17:57.618
Damn it, Dale.
I'm not a charity case.

17:58.285 --> 18:01.121
Who said anything about charity?
Friends help friends.

18:01.205 --> 18:06.668
I mean, it's like that time in '95,
when I jackknifed my horse trailer

18:06.752 --> 18:09.880
and you lent me yours
until I could afford a new one.

18:10.464 --> 18:11.507
Bad year.

18:12.007 --> 18:13.967
You lost a Fifth Wheel Sundowner,

18:14.051 --> 18:17.304
and the Denver Broncos
didn't even make the playoffs.

18:18.055 --> 18:21.725
But whoopie!
We got the Colorado Avalanche.

18:23.310 --> 18:26.730
Because if there's one thing
better than playoff football,

18:26.814 --> 18:29.608
it's regular-season hockey.

18:31.193 --> 18:34.571
And I like it when they sing
that "O Canada."

18:35.155 --> 18:38.283
Charlene can play that on the Casio.

18:40.369 --> 18:43.872
Congratulations.
You've annoyed me once again.

18:45.541 --> 18:46.959
I appreciate it, Dale.

18:48.168 --> 18:50.879
Next time you try to help me,
I'll shoot you.

18:52.798 --> 18:55.801
You and what guns, you broke old bastard?

18:58.887 --> 19:00.889
[country song playing over car stereo]

19:11.108 --> 19:12.025
Oi.

19:12.651 --> 19:13.777
Sorry I'm late.

19:14.528 --> 19:17.281
I had to go to Denver to see Abby.
Got here as fast as I could.

19:19.283 --> 19:21.368
Don't drink the Gatorade in the truck.

19:24.246 --> 19:26.206
Hey, they got a new Skoal.

19:26.707 --> 19:28.208
Sour apple.

19:28.292 --> 19:30.419
It tastes so good,
I accidentally ate some.

19:32.254 --> 19:34.715
Like Ma's pumpkin spice candle
all over again.

19:37.217 --> 19:39.469
Are you just not gonna say nothin'?

19:41.096 --> 19:42.264
Fuck you.

19:43.849 --> 19:45.100
At least we're talking.

19:46.393 --> 19:47.519
What's all this?

19:48.562 --> 19:51.064
I'm selling useless shit
that don't work no more.

19:51.148 --> 19:52.065
Why don't you hop in?

19:54.109 --> 19:55.277
Whoa, come on.

19:56.153 --> 19:57.946
Oh! Man...

19:58.030 --> 20:00.282
These are the Kitty Cats we rode as kids.

20:00.866 --> 20:04.203
Remember, I'd ride around with
a Mountain Dew in a brown paper bag

20:04.286 --> 20:06.205
and you'd act like a cop and pull me over?

20:08.207 --> 20:10.209
We were fortune-tellers on that one, huh?

20:11.919 --> 20:13.337
We done? I got shit to do.

20:15.881 --> 20:16.840
All right.

20:18.342 --> 20:19.176
I'm sorry.

20:19.927 --> 20:23.513
What do you want me to do?
Keep apologizing? Wanna hit me?

20:24.097 --> 20:26.016
You want me to drink that Gatorade bott--

20:27.643 --> 20:28.518
[groans]

20:29.102 --> 20:30.270
Apology accepted.

20:31.772 --> 20:33.774
You gotta let me flex, man.

20:34.566 --> 20:36.276
Holy shoe.

20:39.112 --> 20:41.531
You made me swallow my dip, you dillhole!

20:42.866 --> 20:43.742
[Cole grunts]

20:44.868 --> 20:46.536
Oh, hey, Dad.

20:47.621 --> 20:50.457
I'm sorry I'm late.
I... I went to see Abby.

20:50.540 --> 20:51.792
You weren't missed.

20:53.418 --> 20:54.378
[Dale] All right...

20:54.461 --> 20:59.466
Well, I better go drain pus
out of a cow's ear.

20:59.967 --> 21:01.677
It'll be more fun than this.

21:02.427 --> 21:04.137
Thanks for coming by, Dale.

21:04.638 --> 21:05.847
About that shotgun.

21:07.057 --> 21:09.559
This is bingo night at the VFW.

21:09.643 --> 21:13.230
If I'm runnin' hot,
I'll be your huckleberry.

21:16.817 --> 21:17.651
Dad, wait.

21:23.907 --> 21:25.534
Sorry about the Peterson ranch.

21:27.286 --> 21:29.121
Should've listened to you.

21:30.414 --> 21:31.498
I was stupid.

21:32.624 --> 21:33.500
I was wrong.

21:37.963 --> 21:40.215
Dad, we gotta talk this through.

21:40.799 --> 21:42.843
Something else you're wrong about.

21:51.560 --> 21:52.519
Hey, Hank.

21:54.271 --> 21:55.397
Hey, Mom, can I get a beer?

21:56.606 --> 21:57.899
That must be nice.

21:58.400 --> 22:02.404
I'm working two jobs, thanks to you,
and you have time for a drink.

22:04.573 --> 22:06.408
I came here to talk, all right?

22:06.908 --> 22:09.619
If I just wanted to drink,
I'd do it in my truck, like normal.

22:11.204 --> 22:13.749
Oh, good.
So that is normal.

22:20.005 --> 22:21.089
What do you want?

22:27.429 --> 22:29.347
[sighs] Colt and I screwed up.

22:30.807 --> 22:32.017
And I'm sorry.

22:33.143 --> 22:34.227
I know I let you down.

22:35.604 --> 22:39.566
Especially since I'm supposed to be
the smart, good-looking, cool one.

22:41.109 --> 22:44.446
[sighs] I don't know.
We just got caught up in it.

22:44.946 --> 22:47.824
It's like when you're binge-watching
<i>Fuller House.</i>

22:48.325 --> 22:51.036
You know it's a bad idea,
but you get caught up in it.

22:53.038 --> 22:55.832
You wanna find out
how DJ gets out of that mess.

22:57.042 --> 22:59.002
I don't know what to tell you.

22:59.586 --> 23:02.881
Your apology means shit
unless you change your behavior,

23:02.964 --> 23:05.008
and I see no evidence of that.

23:05.967 --> 23:07.886
Every time I think about what you did,

23:07.969 --> 23:09.971
-I just...
-I know.

23:11.473 --> 23:13.350
You're not mad, you're disappointed.

23:13.433 --> 23:15.894
No, I wanna kill you in your sleep.

23:17.813 --> 23:20.023
I always have your back.

23:20.107 --> 23:24.611
But there's a breaking point, okay?
Actions have fucking consequences.

23:25.737 --> 23:27.781
Same thing Uncle Jesse told DJ.

23:30.283 --> 23:32.702
Not in those exact words.
It's a family show.

23:35.580 --> 23:37.082
How's this for a change?

23:38.542 --> 23:40.418
Let me come back and take over this place.

23:41.128 --> 23:44.172
Let me be the one waking up
at 4:00 at the ranch

23:44.256 --> 23:45.799
and working till 2:00 here.

23:47.634 --> 23:48.468
Okay.

23:49.636 --> 23:50.679
Okay.

23:52.097 --> 23:53.306
So we're doing this?

23:53.390 --> 23:56.810
Sure. What could go wrong?
You're the smart one, right?

24:09.865 --> 24:11.032
This is great.

24:11.783 --> 24:17.038
Our Easter tradition is eating TV dinners
while we watch <i>The Ten Commandments.</i>

24:19.124 --> 24:20.375
Chuck always times it

24:20.458 --> 24:23.712
so he peels back the plastic film
off his cherry cobbler

24:23.795 --> 24:26.506
just as Moses parts the Red Sea.

24:28.550 --> 24:32.220
Charlton Heston,
that's who I wanna see rise from the dead.

24:34.514 --> 24:38.476
I never liked Easter as a kid.
The Easter Bunny freaked me out.

24:38.560 --> 24:41.021
He wore a vest and a tie, but no pants.

24:41.104 --> 24:43.064
Then you have to sit on his lap
and take a picture?

24:43.148 --> 24:44.357
Uh, no, thank you.

24:45.609 --> 24:47.319
A vest and a tie and no pants?

24:47.402 --> 24:49.404
Sounds like Rooster at senior prom.

24:50.780 --> 24:53.742
News anchors. Coat and tie, no pants.

24:53.825 --> 24:55.785
You can't see what's under those desks.

24:57.537 --> 24:59.372
Is there more wine?

25:00.832 --> 25:01.958
Every Easter,

25:02.042 --> 25:06.171
Beau would tell the boys there were
eggs hidden all over the property.

25:06.254 --> 25:11.426
They'd spend hours moving hay bales,
mowing pastures, pruning bushes...

25:12.177 --> 25:14.054
Never found a single egg.

25:14.137 --> 25:16.181
But their chores were done by church.

25:18.141 --> 25:19.726
There were never any eggs?

25:20.727 --> 25:22.395
No, there was one.

25:22.479 --> 25:25.190
It's still out there.
You should go look for it.

25:28.276 --> 25:29.819
Colt, don't. There's no egg.

25:32.155 --> 25:34.282
Hey, y'all. Sorry I'm late.

25:35.450 --> 25:37.953
Mrs. Phillips, you look lovely as always.

25:38.536 --> 25:41.748
Chuck, you still owe me 50 bucks
from fantasy football.

25:42.332 --> 25:45.794
I was looking good until Aaron Rodgers
turned into Colt Bennett.

25:47.295 --> 25:52.425
You drafted a kicker in the third round,
but, yeah, sure, pick on me.

25:54.135 --> 25:55.303
Where were you?

25:55.387 --> 25:58.306
Over at the Petersons',
trying to fix the well.

25:58.390 --> 25:59.849
I think the pump is shot.

25:59.933 --> 26:03.520
Boy, that Peterson ranch
is the gift that keeps on giving.

26:03.603 --> 26:05.772
What's that gonna cost me?

26:06.356 --> 26:08.566
I don't know.
Like, eight, nine hundred bucks?

26:08.650 --> 26:09.776
God damn it.

26:09.859 --> 26:11.069
Beau, please.

26:11.152 --> 26:12.320
It's fucking Easter.

26:14.864 --> 26:18.910
I might have a used one at the shop.
I could give you that one.

26:19.703 --> 26:21.997
Oh. Thank you.

26:22.747 --> 26:24.332
Appreciate the offer, Chuck, but...

26:24.916 --> 26:26.126
we'll figure something out.

26:27.627 --> 26:30.964
Dad, what're you doing?
He wants to give us one.

26:31.047 --> 26:33.925
It's like when you go to Denny's
and lie and tell 'em it's your birthday

26:34.009 --> 26:35.427
so you get a free Grand Slam.

26:37.762 --> 26:41.224
-We need this.
-I said we're good. Drop it.

26:41.308 --> 26:43.601
I told you not to bring up
anything about their troubles.

26:43.685 --> 26:46.855
-[Chuck] I didn't. They did.
-[Janice] Now it's awkward for everyone.

26:46.938 --> 26:49.816
-[Colt] He's offering to help.
-[Maggie] Your dad said, "Drop it."

26:49.899 --> 26:52.027
-It's an insult to--
-[loudly] I'm pregnant!

26:58.074 --> 26:59.117
You're pregnant?

27:01.870 --> 27:03.371
[laughs]

27:04.831 --> 27:05.874
Excuse me.

27:09.502 --> 27:10.628
[Colt clears throat]

27:21.306 --> 27:24.851
[sighs]
I wanted to tell you earlier, but...

27:25.935 --> 27:28.813
you had so much going on
with the ranch and your family.

27:28.897 --> 27:30.815
I didn't wanna add to the stress.

27:31.941 --> 27:33.068
Are you kidding me?

27:34.652 --> 27:35.945
This is amazing.

27:38.156 --> 27:41.618
Yeah, nothing like having a kid
to solve all your problems.

27:46.414 --> 27:50.919
Look, I know you wanted to wait
until we had our lives together, but...

27:51.419 --> 27:53.546
I'll never have my life together.

27:56.800 --> 27:58.885
That doesn't make me feel better.

28:00.637 --> 28:03.515
Are you...
Are you really not happy about this?

28:03.598 --> 28:06.059
You know I wanna have kids
with you, but...

28:06.559 --> 28:08.228
I thought we'd get married first.

28:08.311 --> 28:09.813
You know, buy a house,

28:09.896 --> 28:12.649
get a cat,
see if we can keep that alive first.

28:13.942 --> 28:16.945
Hey, kids are way better than cats.

28:17.028 --> 28:19.239
They scream so you know they're coming.

28:19.989 --> 28:21.533
But cats? You wake up in the mornin',

28:21.616 --> 28:24.828
they're sitting on your chest,
looking like they'll eat your face.

28:28.123 --> 28:33.420
The girl that I've been in love with
since I was 15 years old

28:33.920 --> 28:35.713
is pregnant with my baby.

28:37.382 --> 28:39.259
This is amazing news.

28:42.095 --> 28:44.347
How can we afford a kid?

28:44.931 --> 28:46.307
Last time you went to the ATM,

28:46.391 --> 28:48.727
they didn't have bills small enough
for you to make a withdrawal.

28:52.021 --> 28:57.610
If I got $12.50 in my account,
I should be able to take out $12.50.

29:00.405 --> 29:02.741
How are we gonna do this? I mean...

29:02.824 --> 29:04.617
I leave for Denver in an hour.

29:04.701 --> 29:07.328
We live in different cities.
We won't be able to--

29:07.412 --> 29:09.748
-We'll figure it out.
-How do you know?

29:10.331 --> 29:11.708
'Cause we're Colt and Abby.

29:13.251 --> 29:19.132
You are the only thing in my entire life

29:19.215 --> 29:21.301
that I've ever gotten right.

29:31.269 --> 29:32.896
I ordered a baby blanket.

29:33.980 --> 29:35.356
[chuckles]

29:36.566 --> 29:38.651
-You did?
-Yeah, it was so cute.

29:39.235 --> 29:42.155
It had these little polka-dotted
elephants on it. I mean...

29:42.739 --> 29:45.033
I love polka-dotted elephants.

29:46.785 --> 29:49.537
-We're gonna have a baby!
-Fuck, yeah!

29:49.621 --> 29:50.663
Oh, wait. Whoa, whoa!

29:51.331 --> 29:52.707
Frick, yeah. [chuckles]

29:53.750 --> 29:57.253
Wait. It's Easter.
I can swear again. Fuck, yeah!

30:01.674 --> 30:03.885
