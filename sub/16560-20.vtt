WEBVTT

00:01.001 --> 00:02.377
Rosewood: Previously on Rosewood...

00:02.460 --> 00:04.838
For a guy who needs a kidney transplant,
you're going kinda hard.

00:04.921 --> 00:06.589
-You taking my pulse?
-I just got to make sure.

00:06.673 --> 00:08.925
Too busy playing cop.
That's why nobody trusts you.

00:09.009 --> 00:10.176
Does that include you?

00:12.387 --> 00:15.348
What you're doing for Rosie,
that makes you family.

00:16.349 --> 00:18.226
I'm not getting a pulse.
Charging, stand by.

00:18.309 --> 00:20.145
-Charging.
-Go.

00:20.687 --> 00:22.105
There's been a complication.

00:22.188 --> 00:23.273
Miss D.

00:23.898 --> 00:24.941
What's wrong?

00:26.693 --> 00:27.777
Clear.

00:39.247 --> 00:40.874
Good morning, Mayor. Beautiful day.

00:41.374 --> 00:43.043
How you doing, Philip. I'll see you later.

01:24.000 --> 01:25.835
Little bit more for timing.

01:54.572 --> 01:55.824
He'll pull through.

01:56.199 --> 01:58.201
Slade's survived the foster care system...

01:58.660 --> 02:01.788
a hostage situation,
his heart stopped on the operating table.

02:02.205 --> 02:04.499
I wouldn't count on this new infection
to take him down.

02:04.582 --> 02:06.709
He forced Rosie to take his kidney.

02:06.793 --> 02:08.545
-Now he's the sick one.
-I know.

02:08.628 --> 02:11.881
I wish I knew he was that selfless.
I'd have asked him for a raise.

02:13.758 --> 02:18.263
Breakfast of champions... steel cut
oatmeal with chia seeds and almond butter.

02:18.346 --> 02:21.099
Perfect for keeping the muscles loose
and the spirits lifted.

02:21.182 --> 02:24.060
I'm surprised you're on your feet
after stepping on so many toes.

02:24.144 --> 02:26.521
The nurses told me
you won't stop giving them advice.

02:26.604 --> 02:28.690
Dr. Zeldon had to block your calls.

02:28.773 --> 02:33.111
Well, Villa, I'm just an expert
offering his incredibly valuable opinion.

02:33.194 --> 02:35.697
-He's the chief of surgery.
-And you have a lab to run.

02:35.780 --> 02:37.740
-Who says I can't do both?
-Can you?

02:37.824 --> 02:39.617
I just saw a spasm in your right eye.

02:39.701 --> 02:42.162
You're sweating through your shirt
even though it's 60 degrees in here.

02:42.245 --> 02:44.289
And the double shot of rosiness
you're sipping

02:44.372 --> 02:46.791
tells me you're overcompensating
for how you actually feel.

02:46.875 --> 02:48.835
Really? You're doing my thing to me?
Is that what you're doing?

02:48.918 --> 02:50.211
Have you been sleeping here, Rosie?

02:50.295 --> 02:52.422
I mean, it's only
four weeks since your surgery.

02:52.505 --> 02:54.966
-You're still healing.
-I wouldn't put myself at risk like that.

02:55.925 --> 02:58.344
Rose man, we got you some fresh clothes
for your overnight bag.

02:58.428 --> 03:00.388
Forgot the socks, though. That's on me.

03:00.763 --> 03:03.725
See, Mitchie is perfectly capable of
handling the lab

03:03.808 --> 03:06.477
while I see to Slade's recovery
and Pippy and TMI.

03:06.811 --> 03:09.230
I can't keep lying to mom.
She's starting to suspect.

03:09.689 --> 03:11.608
I might have told her
that you're getting man-groomed

03:11.691 --> 03:14.110
with the head lather, and the
beard trim and the mani-pedi.

03:14.194 --> 03:15.320
Manscaping.

03:18.323 --> 03:19.324
Oh.

03:20.158 --> 03:21.159
Amy.

03:22.285 --> 03:23.494
It's been a while.

03:25.872 --> 03:26.956
What?

03:41.429 --> 03:43.765
Orson Delmar, 33 years old.

03:43.848 --> 03:45.391
Youngest ever mayor of Marshwood.

03:45.850 --> 03:48.895
And valedictorian of his high school,

03:48.978 --> 03:51.773
weirdly good painter of people and bears.

03:52.982 --> 03:54.359
We just got lunch a few weeks ago.

03:54.734 --> 03:56.110
And what happened when you met?

03:56.194 --> 03:57.904
Oh, we ate, talked.

03:58.446 --> 04:00.406
So, yeah, I hadn't seen him in years.

04:00.490 --> 04:02.242
Was he the summer fling you told me about?

04:02.825 --> 04:04.285
Clearly no judgment.

04:05.245 --> 04:06.955
He was my first boyfriend.

04:10.291 --> 04:13.670
'Cause my parents owned a place
in Marshwood, okay, an estate.

04:13.753 --> 04:16.005
And I spent all my summers
growing up there.

04:16.756 --> 04:19.384
Why didn't you tell me the whole story?
What happened?

04:20.009 --> 04:23.805
I didn't think it mattered cause we hadn't
seen him since my parents sold the place,

04:23.888 --> 04:26.808
and that was after I left for college,
and so we just kinda...

04:27.350 --> 04:28.518
you know, lost touch.

04:28.601 --> 04:31.312
T, if you're not comfortable
being involved in this case...

04:31.479 --> 04:33.398
No, I'm good. I'm good.

04:34.816 --> 04:37.443
The sheriff in Marshwood, Amy,
she's my friend.

04:37.527 --> 04:38.861
She mentioned that when we spoke.

04:39.529 --> 04:41.823
They don't have the resources
to conduct the full autopsy.

04:41.906 --> 04:44.909
Yeah, she said some things
weren't adding up about Orson's death,

04:44.993 --> 04:48.496
and she didn't want anyone in Marshwood to
find out until she could prove it.

04:49.789 --> 04:51.541
And that's where we come in.

04:51.624 --> 04:54.002
Continue prepping the body.
Mitchie, run the CT scan.

04:54.085 --> 04:55.086
Yeah.

04:56.379 --> 04:58.756
Wow, you're still here. I'm shocked.

04:58.840 --> 05:00.550
Shouldn't you be halfway
to Marshwood by now?

05:00.633 --> 05:02.677
And shouldn't you be at EMPD by now?

05:02.760 --> 05:04.387
No, I took some vacation days,

05:04.470 --> 05:08.057
because I had a feeling that
I needed to take someone out of Miami,

05:08.141 --> 05:10.476
before Slade's doctors
file a restraining order.

05:10.727 --> 05:13.313
You sure you're not trying to
take yourself out of Miami?

05:13.396 --> 05:15.690
Maybe a little bro-cation.
That's a vacation from your brother.

05:16.065 --> 05:18.192
You know what, Marcos and I are fine.

05:18.276 --> 05:20.987
Oh, "fine." There's that four letter word
that never means any good.

05:21.070 --> 05:24.615
I mean, prepackaged meals are fine,
bottled water is fine,

05:24.699 --> 05:26.326
-sweetheart candies are...
-Fine!

05:26.409 --> 05:30.747
I may have realized that the best way
to help Marcos is to get out of his way.

05:30.830 --> 05:32.123
You okay? That didn't sound like you.

05:32.206 --> 05:35.418
But I'm also taking you to Marshwood to
make sure you don't overdo it, okay?

05:35.501 --> 05:37.628
You have at least four more weeks
until you're 100 percent.

05:37.712 --> 05:41.883
Okay, look, a Rosewood at even 50%
is a normal person at 110.

05:41.966 --> 05:44.177
So don't worry about me.
You're the one with no jurisdiction.

05:44.260 --> 05:46.679
You're the one who was
only recently cleared to drive.

05:46.763 --> 05:48.765
-What are you saying?
-So, I'm coming with you.

05:48.848 --> 05:52.018
'Cause Marshwood is different than Miami.
You're gonna need me.

05:56.689 --> 06:00.026
Rosie, we're only gone a few days.
Did you really need to bring five bags?

06:00.109 --> 06:03.488
Yeah, we're going to the country. We have
to be prepared for everything, okay?

06:03.988 --> 06:05.823
He's not wrong, 'cause from personal
experience,

06:05.907 --> 06:08.242
dressing for a cakewalk, it's no cakewalk.

06:08.326 --> 06:10.536
Rosie, you missed the turn.
The interstate's that way.

06:10.620 --> 06:12.121
Gotta make a quick pit stop.

06:13.331 --> 06:16.417
I'm not sure what the wireless situation
is, but call me with any updates.

06:16.501 --> 06:19.170
I'm not talking every minute.
Maybe every five minutes.

06:19.253 --> 06:21.214
Okay, how about if I just phone you...

06:22.298 --> 06:24.801
-if the situation changes.
-Okay, that works, that works.

06:24.884 --> 06:27.345
And also talk the nurses into
letting you use your own calls.

06:27.428 --> 06:29.931
-That way you don't have to leave here.
-That's not going to happen.

06:31.557 --> 06:33.476
Honestly, Rosie,
if you wanna do right by Slade,

06:33.559 --> 06:35.103
just take care of the kidney he gave you.

06:36.270 --> 06:37.772
Okay? I'll keep you in the know.

06:38.439 --> 06:40.149
-I promise.
-Promise?

06:40.233 --> 06:42.318
-Promise, all right?
-All right.

06:43.319 --> 06:44.737
-Appreciate you, man, thanks.
-Yeah.

07:01.254 --> 07:02.839
Wow, looks exactly the same.

07:03.506 --> 07:05.299
Oh, Sweety's Creamery!

07:05.383 --> 07:07.927
That's where Orson and I
used to get soft serve.

07:08.136 --> 07:10.263
Oh my god, that's where we had our
first...

07:12.056 --> 07:13.141
movie.

07:21.399 --> 07:23.651
I got it. I'll get better at that.

07:24.152 --> 07:25.611
-Tara.
-Yeah, hi.

07:25.778 --> 07:26.946
Been a while.

07:28.823 --> 07:29.907
Oh, come here!

07:31.492 --> 07:33.035
Now that's a proper hello.

07:34.495 --> 07:37.957
Okay, Villa, Rosie, this is Amy Potts.

07:38.416 --> 07:40.793
And we met my first summer in Marshwood.

07:40.877 --> 07:42.420
Oh, we were thick as thieves
there for a while.

07:42.503 --> 07:44.213
-Yeah.
-Orson, too.

07:44.297 --> 07:46.299
Oh, and it's Sheriff Potts.

07:46.966 --> 07:49.510
Welcome to Marshwood.
The nicest place on Earth.

07:50.052 --> 07:53.556
Tara told me all about you two.
I can't wait to see you two in action.

07:55.349 --> 07:57.977
Wow, is that what passes
for evidence collection around here?

07:58.060 --> 07:59.937
No, that's banana cream pie.

08:00.021 --> 08:01.772
Picked them up on my way over.

08:01.856 --> 08:03.232
-They're delicious.
-We're okay.

08:03.316 --> 08:04.984
Did you investigate the crime scene?

08:05.485 --> 08:08.112
Yeah, it's not officially
a crime scene, yet.

08:08.196 --> 08:10.740
My gut's telling me that Orson's death
wasn't an accident.

08:10.823 --> 08:12.658
Based on my preliminary examination,

08:12.742 --> 08:15.536
Orson was dead approximately 4 to 6 hours
prior to your finding him.

08:15.620 --> 08:18.873
Right. But Orson was always careful.
You know, safety first and last.

08:18.956 --> 08:20.666
Flip his tractor? Makes no sense.

08:20.750 --> 08:22.877
Why didn't you continue the investigation
on your own?

08:22.960 --> 08:24.837
I needed an ME,
and Marshwood doesn't have one.

08:25.296 --> 08:28.466
I remembered my old summer buddy worked
for the best pathologist in the state.

08:29.050 --> 08:30.092
May I?

08:31.844 --> 08:35.056
Did you take it apart?
Maybe he was low on brake fluid.

08:35.139 --> 08:37.808
Oh, I haven't laid a hand on it
since we pulled Orson out.

08:37.892 --> 08:39.477
I was waiting for you all to arrive.

08:40.144 --> 08:41.854
Tara, you wanna do your thing?

08:42.271 --> 08:43.356
What thing?

08:43.689 --> 08:45.316
You can take the girl out the country,

08:45.525 --> 08:48.611
but she'll never forget how to
massage her way around a John Deere.

08:51.739 --> 08:53.991
-You're not going to join in on the fun?
-No, I'm good.

08:54.075 --> 08:55.952
Engine grease and silk blazers do not mix.

08:56.035 --> 08:57.370
I'll stick to the top soil.

09:21.561 --> 09:24.188
I couldn't find anything wrong
with the tires or the brake system.

09:24.272 --> 09:27.275
Yeah, and aside from the oil being low,
the engine's working fine.

09:27.358 --> 09:29.652
It really doesn't look like
it's been tampered with.

09:29.819 --> 09:32.029
I just can't believe
Orson would be so reckless.

09:32.113 --> 09:33.573
I don't believe he was reckless.

09:33.656 --> 09:35.241
Minimal bruising on the body suggests that

09:35.324 --> 09:37.285
he was not killed
by the tractor rolling over.

09:37.368 --> 09:40.288
And if he was trapped underneath it, I
would see dirt underneath his fingernails

09:40.371 --> 09:42.164
or signs of struggle in the soil.
But I didn't.

09:42.248 --> 09:43.916
-So what killed him?
-I don't know.

09:44.000 --> 09:47.044
I've to run some more tests,
but he was dead before he hit the ground.

09:47.128 --> 09:49.088
-Are you saying...
-I'm sorry, but yes.

09:50.214 --> 09:51.924
There's a good chance
that your friend was murdered.

10:07.607 --> 10:10.776
So, we found a number of blowfly larvae
in Orson's body.

10:10.860 --> 10:12.612
They usually lay their eggs
within minutes of death.

10:12.695 --> 10:17.033
But these larvae have barely developed,
given the state of decomposition.

10:17.116 --> 10:18.534
They feed off of dead tissue.

10:18.659 --> 10:20.828
Something in the victim's body
must have stunted their growth.

10:20.911 --> 10:23.664
To inhibit larvae development that much,
it must have been poisonous.

10:23.748 --> 10:25.833
So, Orson was poisoned and the same poison

10:25.916 --> 10:28.210
affected the larvae
that fed on his corpse.

10:28.502 --> 10:30.755
Bingo! And to determine what poison,

10:30.963 --> 10:34.091
I'm making a patented Mitchie Mendelson
maggot milkshake.

10:34.175 --> 10:36.844
It's the best way to separate
the organic and inorganic matter.

10:36.927 --> 10:38.012
Did you really have that patented?

10:38.095 --> 10:42.391
I tried... but the patent office
is super political.

10:42.475 --> 10:44.143
Okay, so we know how Orson was murdered.

10:44.226 --> 10:47.480
Hopefully, we find something inside
the house that tells us why. Thanks, guys.

10:48.189 --> 10:51.442
So, we need to locate anything
that could have been used to poison Orson.

10:51.609 --> 10:54.654
That's medicines, needles, inhalers,
food, beverages.

10:54.820 --> 10:57.615
The whole time I was hoping
I was wrong about Orson being murdered.

10:57.823 --> 11:00.159
Marshwood is the type of place
people leave their doors unlocked.

11:00.242 --> 11:02.495
Worst crime we've had
since I've been sheriff was when

11:02.578 --> 11:05.414
Timmy Butler tried to rob the shop
and fled with a garden hose.

11:05.498 --> 11:08.709
But poisoning the mayor, that's big.

11:09.126 --> 11:11.629
There are some pretty personal stuff
in these trash bags.

11:11.712 --> 11:15.257
Photos, letters, journals...
I don't think the killer did this.

11:15.466 --> 11:18.052
Yeah, maybe Orson has some secrets
he didn't want public.

11:18.135 --> 11:19.512
Maybe he was just spring cleaning.

11:19.595 --> 11:21.972
Best way to welcome the future
is to let go of the past.

11:23.265 --> 11:27.728
She maybe onto something. This bag
is labeled "Trash." Orson was purging.

11:27.937 --> 11:29.814
Well, he wasn't throwing everything away.

11:30.064 --> 11:33.234
These are all mine,
and they're labeled "To keep."

11:37.321 --> 11:40.866
I don't know, it was just
two old friends catching up

11:40.950 --> 11:44.328
over a Cracker Barrel Sunrise Sampler,
and a short stack of pecan pancakes.

11:45.204 --> 11:47.998
Why did he keep all your stuff?
Do you think he still had feelings?

11:48.082 --> 11:50.835
No, our relationship
wasn't really like that. I mean,

11:51.460 --> 11:53.421
I left tons of stuff at his place
over the years.

11:53.504 --> 11:55.673
So, maybe he was finally returning it?

11:57.508 --> 11:58.551
I'll be right back.

12:00.219 --> 12:02.972
Do you remember anything else
about your lunch with Orson?

12:04.974 --> 12:06.726
Why are you rocking
your interrogation face?

12:07.935 --> 12:09.478
So are you interrogating me right now?

12:11.772 --> 12:14.442
No, no, there's no reverb in your voice.
There's no squeaking linoleum.

12:14.525 --> 12:16.152
It doesn't sound like
you're at a hospital to me.

12:16.235 --> 12:20.322
I'm not a babysitter. I'm a cop, Rosie.
Waiting at the hospital makes me anxious.

12:20.406 --> 12:22.324
Plus, I had to pick up something
at the station.

12:23.367 --> 12:26.078
Yeah, did that something have
36 grams of fat in a single serving?

12:33.961 --> 12:35.171
You there, Rosie?

12:37.548 --> 12:38.883
Earth to Rosie.

12:38.966 --> 12:40.259
Yeah, no, I'm here.

12:40.342 --> 12:42.553
-No, no, he's not.
-Bye, Rosie.

12:42.636 --> 12:45.848
Come on, Villa, don't tell that you're mad
because I'm criticizing Hornstock's diet.

12:45.931 --> 12:47.183
No, I'm mad because...

12:48.017 --> 12:50.144
I know you care about Slade.
Okay, we all do.

12:50.227 --> 12:53.564
But you have a victim who is
counting on you to solve his murder.

12:53.647 --> 12:57.735
I need you to stop stressing and come to
City Hall so we can check Orson's office.

12:57.818 --> 12:59.820
But there's still evidence
that needs to be collected.

12:59.904 --> 13:02.448
Yeah, TMI and Sheriff Potts
can handle that on their own.

13:02.531 --> 13:04.784
But we still don't know
where Orson was poisoned.

13:04.867 --> 13:06.619
Maybe it was at his work, so let's go.

13:06.702 --> 13:09.789
Okay, okay, I'll go under one condition.

13:09.872 --> 13:12.166
If it involves you calling Hornstock,
then no.

13:12.249 --> 13:15.503
I will go under the condition that you
admit the reason why you're here

13:15.586 --> 13:17.505
working on this case
outside your jurisdiction,

13:17.588 --> 13:20.007
-is because you're avoiding your brother.
-Seriously?

13:21.133 --> 13:23.594
I already told you that Marcos and I--

13:23.677 --> 13:27.056
Are avoiding the subject.
What, you're here avoiding Marcos.

13:30.017 --> 13:34.104
Why don't you all take a load off?
This pie is fresh from the oven.

13:34.605 --> 13:37.358
Mayor Delmar was
the judge of our last bake sale.

13:37.983 --> 13:39.401
Beverly here, won.

13:40.069 --> 13:41.737
What is it with all the baked goods?

13:41.821 --> 13:45.032
Well, in most places, baking is
a nice thing to do for visitors.

13:45.783 --> 13:48.494
My mother always wanted to
retire in a place like Marshwood.

13:48.744 --> 13:52.248
You can tell the good ones,
not afraid to talk about their mamas.

13:52.456 --> 13:55.084
We got you the minutes
from our Town Council meetings.

13:55.251 --> 13:57.044
You need anything else, you let us know.

13:58.128 --> 13:59.296
Thank you.

14:05.386 --> 14:06.887
Villa, check this out.

14:07.263 --> 14:10.224
Condoms, testosterone gel and body paint.

14:10.432 --> 14:12.768
Not the usual supplies
you pick up at Staples.

14:19.316 --> 14:21.402
Tara, there you are.

14:23.028 --> 14:25.072
Do you remember when we took this photo?

14:25.906 --> 14:27.283
The time I split my overalls.

14:27.658 --> 14:29.702
-How could I forget?
-I forgot that.

14:31.370 --> 14:32.329
-Oh.
-Hmm.

14:33.038 --> 14:34.748
-I should have called more.
-Yeah.

14:35.207 --> 14:36.709
Would have made us miss you more.

14:38.294 --> 14:39.545
That didn't help, did it?

14:42.882 --> 14:46.176
I know this certainly isn't the time, but

14:46.427 --> 14:48.470
I don't think you're the only one
Orson was missing.

14:50.556 --> 14:52.850
Found these love letters
in one of the trash bags.

14:54.226 --> 14:56.312
I think Orson was having
a secret relationship.

15:00.024 --> 15:01.901
For love letters, these are tame.

15:02.109 --> 15:04.361
"I'm the waves, you're the beach."

15:04.778 --> 15:06.906
Yeah, well, Orson was always
kind of a prude.

15:06.989 --> 15:08.532
Took him a whole summer to hold my hand.

15:08.616 --> 15:10.117
If he threw away every letter,

15:10.200 --> 15:12.578
whoever he was seeing,
he wanted to keep their identity a secret.

15:12.661 --> 15:14.121
Maybe she was married?

15:14.204 --> 15:16.498
Marshwood isn't the kind of place
you can keep a secret.

15:16.582 --> 15:17.625
I tried once,

15:17.833 --> 15:20.920
and then that Sunday, Pastor Frank
gave a sermon about skinny dipping

15:21.003 --> 15:22.129
in Tucker Lake.

15:22.212 --> 15:25.090
You can keep anything secret
if you lock your doors tight enough.

15:25.382 --> 15:27.760
-We don't--
-Lock doors in Marshwood. I know.

15:27.843 --> 15:32.431
We found performance enhancers
in Orson's desk.

15:33.140 --> 15:35.142
Maybe there was a reason
he was keeping it at work.

15:38.228 --> 15:39.647
Of course I knew Orson.

15:39.730 --> 15:43.525
Everyone knows the Mayor. Marshwood's
only got a few hundred people.

15:43.609 --> 15:46.487
And we worked pretty closely,
me running the Tourism Board and all.

15:46.987 --> 15:49.198
Wow, worked closely.

15:49.281 --> 15:51.951
You know, in Miami, we call that cheating.

15:52.284 --> 15:54.620
I really don't know
what you're talking about.

15:54.703 --> 15:57.957
No? Well, we actually found
the letters that he wrote you.

15:58.040 --> 16:00.334
-"I'm the waves, you're the beach."
-Beach.

16:00.668 --> 16:02.252
Sandy, that's you.

16:02.336 --> 16:04.797
Orson could never pass up a chance
to tell a terrible joke.

16:04.880 --> 16:07.883
How could you do that to Earl?
You all have been married for years.

16:07.967 --> 16:10.135
Don't you know
I'm eaten up inside about it?

16:10.511 --> 16:13.305
But I loved Orson. Truly, he is...

16:15.015 --> 16:16.350
was my soulmate.

16:16.433 --> 16:18.477
Your husband didn't suspect anything?

16:18.560 --> 16:20.062
We kept it in the office.

16:21.063 --> 16:23.983
I am not proud, but I finally
told Earl the truth this morning.

16:24.400 --> 16:26.318
Figured it would come out
with all this mess.

16:26.402 --> 16:30.864
The worst part is, Earl was the one
filling that testosterone prescription

16:30.948 --> 16:34.118
so Orson could perform.

16:34.702 --> 16:37.204
Your husband was Orson's pharmacist?

16:37.287 --> 16:38.414
Him and all of Marshwood.

16:38.497 --> 16:41.041
Testosterone gel can cause
heart attacks in men.

16:41.125 --> 16:44.586
So, if her husband was intentionally
giving Orson the wrong dosage,

16:44.753 --> 16:45.963
that's murder.

16:48.632 --> 16:50.134
Is that night blooming jasmine?

16:50.217 --> 16:52.219
-You must be...
-Get down!

16:54.638 --> 16:56.598
Earl, drop the damn shotgun!

16:57.808 --> 17:00.102
You're trespassing! Get going!

17:00.185 --> 17:02.146
Does he always roll out
the welcome mat like this?

17:02.229 --> 17:05.065
Earl's got a bit of a temper.
Especially when he's been drinking.

17:06.483 --> 17:08.235
This is between me and my wife.

17:08.318 --> 17:10.320
I think we should draw that fire
away from the GTO.

17:10.404 --> 17:11.739
Are you really thinking
about your car right now?

17:11.822 --> 17:14.241
Earl's shot may do a little damage to me,
but it would kill the Yellow Queen.

17:14.324 --> 17:16.827
Whatever, just keep him talking.

17:17.119 --> 17:18.787
What? Hey, Villa!

17:18.871 --> 17:20.497
Villa, the bad guy's that way.

17:20.831 --> 17:21.707
Earl.

17:21.790 --> 17:23.834
Get down.

17:25.044 --> 17:26.462
It's Tara Izikoff.

17:26.879 --> 17:28.255
I don't know if you remember me.

17:28.338 --> 17:29.798
Yeah, yeah, you...

17:30.841 --> 17:32.259
You're the skinny dipper.

17:32.342 --> 17:38.807
Okay... Well, yeah, but also, um,
you knew my friend, Orson, your mayor.

17:39.266 --> 17:42.061
He remembered every moment
that we spent together.

17:42.519 --> 17:46.440
Like when I cut my finger
picking raspberries.

17:46.523 --> 17:49.276
That time we almost drowned in the lake.

17:50.194 --> 17:52.154
And, kissing...

17:53.155 --> 17:54.948
in the back of the movie theater.

17:55.908 --> 17:57.659
That's the man that you killed.

18:03.290 --> 18:04.541
I didn't kill anybody.

18:04.625 --> 18:05.876
We'll be the judge of that.

18:06.668 --> 18:07.920
Drop the weapon.

18:11.340 --> 18:13.717
Oh, I love a town where
nobody locks their doors.

18:19.181 --> 18:20.390
I want the lawyer.

18:20.808 --> 18:24.561
Jeff Groves, you met him at City Hall.
He's the only lawyer in town.

18:25.229 --> 18:28.148
Look, I hate to be rude, Earl,
but you really need to start talking.

18:28.857 --> 18:31.819
We know you killed Orson.
He was sleeping with your wife.

18:31.902 --> 18:33.612
You were his pharmacist.
You were mixing higher dozes of

18:33.695 --> 18:35.239
testosterone than was prescribed.

18:35.322 --> 18:36.406
He overdosed, stopped his heart.

18:36.490 --> 18:39.910
Look, if I wanted to kill the mayor,
I'd have shot him. It's much easier.

18:40.244 --> 18:41.495
Like you tried to shoot us?

18:41.829 --> 18:44.123
If I wanted to hit you,
you'd be dead right now.

18:44.873 --> 18:47.835
I just found out about
Sandy and Orson this morning.

18:47.918 --> 18:49.711
I've been drinking. I was angry.

18:50.129 --> 18:51.255
What have you got for me?

18:51.338 --> 18:53.924
We examined Orson's heart,
and we tested his blood.

18:54.007 --> 18:55.384
It's impossible to tell for sure,

18:55.467 --> 18:57.928
but there doesn't appear to be
any evidence of a heart attack.

18:58.011 --> 19:00.472
I ran the chemicals
in the testosterone gel you found.

19:00.556 --> 19:01.932
None were present in the larvae.

19:02.015 --> 19:04.685
So, the gel isn't the cause of death.
Earl didn't kill Orson.

19:04.768 --> 19:07.104
Yeah, I told you.
Now, can you open the door, please?

19:07.187 --> 19:09.940
You shot at cops.
That door is staying locked.

19:10.023 --> 19:12.776
What she said.
We're transferring you to County.

19:12.860 --> 19:15.362
We need to look for a different toxin, but
I need results in hours not days.

19:15.445 --> 19:18.407
I already eliminated all the
usual suspects in the prelim tox screen.

19:19.158 --> 19:21.243
-I'm at a loss for what to do next.
-I'm not.

19:21.869 --> 19:23.036
But you're not gonna like it.

19:43.348 --> 19:44.600
MITCHELL T. MENDELSON
PRIVATE PATHOLOGIST

19:51.565 --> 19:54.484
Welcome to my old hang.

19:54.568 --> 19:56.320
-Brother, brother.
-Oh, sorry.

19:56.403 --> 19:58.822
Wasn't sure we were
on the public intimacy scale.

19:59.698 --> 20:02.784
Oh, this is nice.
It's like a postcard out here.

20:02.868 --> 20:04.578
Maybe getting outside the city
isn't so bad.

20:04.661 --> 20:08.207
Says the sister who vetoed every
Rosewood family camping trip since

20:08.665 --> 20:10.042
-forever.
-Oh, man!

20:10.125 --> 20:12.961
Did I miss driving that hoss
on the open road.

20:13.045 --> 20:15.714
She handles about like you'd expect.

20:15.797 --> 20:16.965
Did you bring Orson's body?

20:17.049 --> 20:19.426
As per request, in case
we need to run any additional tests.

20:19.509 --> 20:20.969
So, where do we set up shop?

20:24.139 --> 20:27.100
This is different. A veterinary clinic?

20:27.184 --> 20:29.728
Well, unfortunately,
this is the best we have to offer.

20:30.062 --> 20:33.232
Coroner's office closed last year,
and nearest hospital is five towns over.

20:33.315 --> 20:34.775
But it should have most of what you need.

20:34.858 --> 20:37.236
And Blue Thunder will give us the rest.
Thank you.

20:37.319 --> 20:40.113
Why did the coroner's office close?
Did people stop dying?

20:40.864 --> 20:42.241
Doctor Mack retired.

20:42.616 --> 20:46.662
We weren't in need of a replacement
until this awful business with Orson.

20:48.038 --> 20:49.915
I'll be in my office if you need anything.

20:52.000 --> 20:56.171
I didn't want to freak you out with a
big hug but it's awfully good to meet you.

20:57.172 --> 20:58.715
Thanks for taking care of Tara for us.

21:01.176 --> 21:03.387
Okay, let's scrub this place down
and get to work.

21:10.936 --> 21:12.562
Are we sure this is the best option?

21:12.896 --> 21:16.108
Pets can lower human stress levels
better than some prescription meds.

21:16.441 --> 21:20.112
You know, my owl, Charlie,
oversaw all my early cases.

21:20.195 --> 21:23.407
That is until he mistook
a gall bladder for a mouse.

21:24.616 --> 21:25.909
Which was an honest mistake.

21:26.493 --> 21:27.786
What's the game plan.

21:28.745 --> 21:30.455
Cause we're back to no motive, no suspect,

21:30.539 --> 21:33.709
and every single poison that we've
tested for has come back negative.

21:35.752 --> 21:36.670
I'm good.

21:38.213 --> 21:39.756
-We're gonna make it.
-Yes, we are.

21:39.840 --> 21:42.884
Cause we know where Orson died
is a small, isolated town,

21:42.968 --> 21:45.429
with not many resources.
That limits the killer's options.

21:45.512 --> 21:46.972
So we want to do a reverse diagnosis.

21:47.055 --> 21:50.350
Exactly. Based on the region, the season,
and the known symptoms,

21:50.434 --> 21:53.478
we can narrow down all the possible
poisons the killer could have used.

21:53.729 --> 21:54.604
On it.

22:02.112 --> 22:06.992
Okay, I get it. No call, no change.
But gimme a ring when you can.

22:17.544 --> 22:22.132
Hornstock, Rosie. It was a test,
you passed. Congrats. Congrats.

22:22.215 --> 22:24.343
But, uh, gimme a ring.

22:29.056 --> 22:31.558
Rosie, what are you doing out here?

22:32.642 --> 22:36.104
The town council generously gave us
all their files

22:36.188 --> 22:38.607
and we maybe also had
some ice cream sundaes.

22:38.982 --> 22:40.942
TMI was right. Sweety's is the best.

22:41.026 --> 22:43.153
Digitalis. It's digitalis.

22:43.236 --> 22:45.489
Digitalis, it's also known as Foxglove,

22:45.697 --> 22:49.117
and it's one of five poisonous flowers
currently in bloom in the area.

22:49.201 --> 22:52.204
Yes, it contains a naturally occurring
poison which is known as Digitoxin.

22:52.287 --> 22:55.916
Yes, and we found 4 milligram per liter
of digitoxin in his blood.

22:55.999 --> 22:57.501
So that is what killed Orson.

22:57.584 --> 23:00.212
Now, given that Orson was acting normally
in the hours leading up to his death,

23:00.545 --> 23:01.671
it's likely that the killer administered

23:01.755 --> 23:04.341
one milligram of poison per hour,
for four hours.

23:04.424 --> 23:06.927
Well, once we have a suspect,
we'll be able to test for traces.

23:08.720 --> 23:11.306
This town isn't too big.
Might as well test everyone, right?

23:12.599 --> 23:13.892
You can make that happen?

24:05.944 --> 24:08.071
This isn't going to hurt, right?

24:08.321 --> 24:10.240
No, I'm just going to swab
the inside of your cheek.

24:11.032 --> 24:12.242
Open.

24:13.660 --> 24:15.078
And that's it.

24:16.538 --> 24:18.665
I don't mean to speak out of line, but

24:18.790 --> 24:21.251
I think Orson was
talking about you the other day.

24:22.085 --> 24:24.504
After your lunch... it's Tara, right?

24:26.548 --> 24:30.343
The way he talked about you.
It made me happy to see him so happy.

24:31.928 --> 24:33.430
I'm sorry if that's weird...

24:34.055 --> 24:35.932
No, no, it's very sweet. Yeah.

24:36.808 --> 24:38.477
He was proud of you.

24:40.103 --> 24:42.105
Orson didn't have much of a family, and

24:42.189 --> 24:44.399
he mentioned yours wasn't
the most supportive.

24:44.858 --> 24:47.569
I'm guessing that's why
you two were so close.

24:48.403 --> 24:51.072
Anyway, I just thought you should know.

24:52.491 --> 24:53.658
-Thank you.
-Yeah.

24:55.535 --> 24:58.997
Guys, guys, sorry to interrupt.
You need to see this.

25:02.459 --> 25:05.128
I tested 80% of the samples
we've taken, right?

25:05.462 --> 25:08.673
and 100% of them tested positive
for digitalis.

25:08.757 --> 25:11.968
Right, so either someone in Marshwood
poisoned everyone,

25:12.052 --> 25:14.721
or everyone in Marshwood poisoned Orson.

25:18.350 --> 25:19.351
It's Hornstock.

25:19.434 --> 25:21.102
He said he would call
if there were any changes.

25:22.145 --> 25:23.730
Slow down, slow down, what happened?

25:25.023 --> 25:28.109
I mean, I was only gone an hour or two.
He was doing fine when I left.

25:28.568 --> 25:29.778
What did the doctors say?

25:30.987 --> 25:31.947
Hornstock.

25:33.073 --> 25:34.115
Is he gonna make it?

25:40.664 --> 25:42.582
-So that was...
-Hornstock.

25:42.916 --> 25:43.917
And Slade?

25:44.000 --> 25:46.169
The infection he had turned septic.

25:46.253 --> 25:48.213
So far, his immune system
is not responding

25:48.296 --> 25:50.715
to any of the antibiotics
his doctors have administered.

25:50.799 --> 25:53.635
So, until they find the right combination,
it's not great.

25:54.427 --> 25:56.012
-Where you going?
-To get the GTO.

25:56.096 --> 25:58.056
I dragged you here,
I'm gonna drag you back.

25:58.139 --> 26:00.100
Hey, is everything okay?

26:03.687 --> 26:06.231
Actually, no.

26:06.314 --> 26:08.900
-Um, I'm sorry. We were just--
-Staying right here.

26:09.818 --> 26:11.736
If I'm gonna trust Slade's doctors
not to give up on him,

26:11.820 --> 26:13.196
I am not going to give up on Orson.

26:14.656 --> 26:15.824
So, so far,

26:16.783 --> 26:20.161
every single citizen of Marshwood
has tested positive for digitalis.

26:20.328 --> 26:22.789
-We need to narrow the suspect pool.
-Too bad.

26:23.331 --> 26:24.332
I just widened it.

26:24.416 --> 26:26.793
You can add one of your own
to the list of suspects.

26:26.876 --> 26:29.087
-What? Who?
-Me.

26:29.838 --> 26:32.841
I thought I'd run my own test,
see what turned up. It was positive.

26:33.633 --> 26:35.385
Okay, well, that doesn't make any sense.

26:35.885 --> 26:38.972
Let me guess, it does to you.

26:39.806 --> 26:40.932
It does to me.

26:44.811 --> 26:46.688
Now we know how everyone in town was

26:46.771 --> 26:49.065
exposed to the same poison
that killed Orson.

26:49.149 --> 26:51.401
The air must be filled
with digitalis pollen.

26:51.484 --> 26:53.820
It's harmless, but I think
it contaminated the samples.

26:53.903 --> 26:57.657
With this much in bloom, all of Marshwood
had the opportunity to poison Orson.

26:57.741 --> 26:58.992
Now we need to look at motive.

27:02.162 --> 27:05.832
Sorry, I can't resist the salaciousness
of small town squabbles.

27:06.333 --> 27:08.501
Sorry, squabbles, that's not in Marshwood.

27:08.877 --> 27:11.338
Au contraire.
According to the transcripts,

27:11.421 --> 27:13.632
the Marshwood town council meetings
had it all.

27:13.715 --> 27:16.468
Innuendo, thinly veiled threats,
emphasis on thin,

27:16.676 --> 27:18.428
and judgment. Oh, the judgment.

27:18.595 --> 27:20.597
Guess Marshwood was not
as picture perfect as we thought.

27:20.680 --> 27:23.600
I would like to direct your attention
to page 136, wherein

27:23.683 --> 27:27.812
Jeff Groves, Marshwood's only attorney
and town council treasurer,

27:27.896 --> 27:31.274
suggested that somebody was stealing money
from the town coffers.

27:31.358 --> 27:33.485
-You mean like embezzlement?
-I mean like embezzlement.

27:33.568 --> 27:37.364
And Mr. Groves thinks that
the guilty part was...

27:38.823 --> 27:40.033
Orson.

27:40.867 --> 27:45.872
Okay, the Orson I knew would never
have done something like that. So...

27:45.955 --> 27:48.500
T, sometimes we don't know people
as well as we think.

27:48.583 --> 27:50.251
We need to talk to Mr. Groves.

28:02.347 --> 28:03.932
What's going on with you?

28:05.767 --> 28:08.019
Besides my first boyfriend being murdered,

28:08.103 --> 28:10.689
then accused of stealing...

28:10.772 --> 28:12.774
Yeah, besides that.

28:14.484 --> 28:16.319
When I had lunch with Orson,

28:17.237 --> 28:19.197
I might have given him some advice.

28:19.531 --> 28:22.450
Cause I knew him, Pip,
and I could tell he was unhappy.

28:22.534 --> 28:27.330
And he admitted to being stressed and that
he needed to get rid of stuff in his life

28:27.414 --> 28:30.542
that wasn't making him happy,
and so, I might have said...

28:32.168 --> 28:34.754
"Do whatever it takes
to make yourself happy."

28:35.088 --> 28:38.049
And now, I'm afraid
that the stress was financial.

28:38.508 --> 28:41.302
And that "Do whatever it takes
to make you happy" was embezzlement.

28:42.345 --> 28:45.056
So, what if I caused him
to do something that got him killed?

28:47.225 --> 28:49.144
Okay. Okay.

28:50.395 --> 28:54.524
Say your advice caused Orson to
come back here and steal that money.

28:55.191 --> 28:58.069
Say it pissed someone off about i
and they killed him.

28:58.153 --> 28:59.362
Oh, my God.

29:00.488 --> 29:02.031
Oh...

29:02.115 --> 29:05.285
You can't be guilty
of someone else's mistake.

29:05.368 --> 29:06.619
So...

29:07.370 --> 29:11.082
let's get out there and find
who really killed your friend.

29:14.252 --> 29:17.297
Freshly squeezed lemonade.
You sure you don't want some?

29:17.672 --> 29:21.009
-I make the finest in town.
-Actually, yes, we would really like some.

29:21.468 --> 29:23.678
Never take a beverage from a man
with a spittoon.

29:23.762 --> 29:24.888
-First of all, I own a spittoon.
-No, you don't.

29:24.971 --> 29:27.348
You're right, I don't. But you're still
judging him unfairly for a spittoon.

29:27.432 --> 29:29.017
-Stop saying spittoon.
-Okay, spittoon.

29:30.059 --> 29:32.771
That spittoon belonged to
my great grandfather.

29:33.313 --> 29:34.939
A General in the confederate army.

29:35.023 --> 29:36.483
Okay, not so unfairly.

29:36.816 --> 29:37.650
Thank you.

29:37.734 --> 29:41.237
I keep it around to remind myself
never to turn out like him.

29:41.321 --> 29:44.282
Marshwood might appear to be
stuck in the past, but

29:44.365 --> 29:47.410
we welcome the progress
the present brings.

29:47.494 --> 29:49.788
Speaking of Marshwood,
we uncovered some evidence

29:49.871 --> 29:51.873
that the town
isn't doing that well financially.

29:51.956 --> 29:54.250
-You couldn't be further from the truth.
-Oh, cut the BS.

29:54.793 --> 29:57.378
Our associate read the
town council meeting minutes.

29:57.462 --> 30:00.882
You accused Orson of embezzling money
from the Marshwood treasury.

30:01.966 --> 30:03.218
I, uh...

30:03.843 --> 30:06.513
didn't mean to accuse Orson so publicly.

30:08.181 --> 30:10.975
But... we're desperate.

30:11.059 --> 30:14.103
Marshwood's had to cut funding to schools,
fire the police force.

30:14.187 --> 30:16.356
If we don't merge with the next town over,

30:16.439 --> 30:19.275
there's going to be a lot of people here
with no way to support their family.

30:19.359 --> 30:22.487
Which would give a lot of people here
reason to want Orson dead.

30:22.570 --> 30:24.572
So where was the money he stole going?

30:24.656 --> 30:27.659
So, wait. You're the only lawyer in town.
Did you draw up Orson's will?

30:27.742 --> 30:29.118
-I did.
-You mind grabbing that for us?

30:29.202 --> 30:30.370
Sure.

30:33.748 --> 30:37.961
If my boyfriend wanted to impress me,
one pair of diamond earrings would do.

30:38.044 --> 30:39.170
You have five.

30:39.254 --> 30:41.089
And the couture to match.

30:41.172 --> 30:43.258
It's funny.
I almost wore this to work today.

30:43.341 --> 30:44.884
What a coincidence. Me, too.

30:44.968 --> 30:46.803
Did Orson buy you all this stuff, Sandy?

30:46.886 --> 30:48.680
Maybe with the money
he was stealing from the town.

30:48.763 --> 30:51.224
No. Orson wasn't a thief.

30:51.307 --> 30:53.685
We have a witness who says otherwise.

30:53.768 --> 30:57.689
Who, Jeff Groves? Nasty nitwit.

30:58.022 --> 31:00.441
So can you explain where you got
all this high end merchandise?

31:00.525 --> 31:04.070
Yeah, it's my side business.
I buy in bulk and sell it all on Ebay.

31:05.029 --> 31:07.365
The margins are pretty good, but...

31:07.699 --> 31:10.577
honestly, it keeps me so busy,
it feels like having a full time job.

31:11.661 --> 31:13.121
Sandy, where did you get this cup?

31:13.496 --> 31:16.833
That was Orson's flavor cup.
Made everything taste like oranges.

31:16.916 --> 31:20.169
Because he hated the taste of water.
He carried that cup with him everywhere.

31:20.503 --> 31:23.464
-He wouldn't just leave it behind.
-Maybe he left it to you in the will.

31:23.798 --> 31:25.216
Like he did everything else.

31:26.342 --> 31:27.427
What are you talking about?

31:27.510 --> 31:29.512
You're the sole beneficiary
for Orson's estate.

31:29.596 --> 31:30.805
Which gives you motive.

31:30.889 --> 31:33.641
See the powder residue around the rim?
I believe it's digitalis.

31:33.725 --> 31:35.977
This cup is our murder weapon,
and it was on your drying rack.

31:36.060 --> 31:38.062
Which you tried to wipe clean.

31:38.146 --> 31:41.399
We knew you had motive to want Orson dead.
Now we know you had the means, too.

31:41.482 --> 31:43.860
But I was with Earl all day.
He'll tell you.

31:43.943 --> 31:47.697
I'm sure the husband you cheated on
will do everything he can to back you up.

31:48.907 --> 31:50.533
Your town. Your collar.

31:51.034 --> 31:54.412
Sandy Langford, you're under arrest
for the murder of Orson Delmar.

32:03.588 --> 32:05.089
Well, Sandy's been booked.

32:05.173 --> 32:08.551
Back to Slade, Marcos and real-life stuff.

32:13.640 --> 32:15.975
-Rosie. we need you. Now.
-What?

32:16.142 --> 32:18.311
Come here. Come here. She just collapsed.

32:24.025 --> 32:25.193
Rosie, what's going on?

32:25.902 --> 32:27.278
Her heart just stopped.

32:34.827 --> 32:36.829
Rosie, you're not supposed to
lift anything over 50 pounds.

32:36.913 --> 32:38.081
I had to. She'd be dead already.

32:38.164 --> 32:40.291
-What is it?
-Cardiac arrest from the digitalis poison.

32:40.375 --> 32:42.543
-Villa, grab that stand.
-Should I call an ambulance?

32:42.627 --> 32:44.504
No, the nearest hospital
is over an hour away.

32:44.587 --> 32:45.838
If we're gonna save her,
we need to do it right here.

32:45.922 --> 32:47.632
-I'll prep an epi injection.
-Hurry up.

32:50.343 --> 32:52.095
Come on. Let's go, Mitchie.

32:52.178 --> 32:53.888
I got it. Here we go.

32:58.059 --> 33:01.938
One, two, three, four, five.

33:08.361 --> 33:09.362
-Anything?
-Not yet.

33:09.445 --> 33:11.698
-Should I get the autopulse?
-It's too late for that. Again.

33:13.032 --> 33:16.536
One, two, three, four, five.

33:17.370 --> 33:18.663
Come on, baby girl.

33:18.746 --> 33:21.165
-Please, come on, come on, come on.
-Come on, now.

33:21.833 --> 33:24.627
Come on, come on, come on, come on.-

33:27.505 --> 33:29.966
-Easy.
-It's gonna be okay. You're gonna be okay.

33:30.049 --> 33:32.635
We just need to administer the antidote.
Prep the digibind.

33:32.719 --> 33:34.637
-Okay.
-What just happened?

33:36.639 --> 33:39.559
The person who killed Orson,
they just tried to kill you, too.

33:43.354 --> 33:46.607
Thanks. Earl corroborated Sandy's alibi.

33:46.691 --> 33:48.568
Said she was with him the day Orson died.

33:48.651 --> 33:49.777
Well, that coupled with the poison,

33:49.861 --> 33:52.405
I'm gonna guess we're
taking Sandy off the suspects list.

33:52.488 --> 33:53.781
Hey, guys.

33:54.032 --> 33:56.200
Mitchie, now is not the time
for a expenses report.

33:56.284 --> 33:57.452
That's a good zinger bust.

33:57.535 --> 34:00.663
But these are not my expenses,
they're the city of Marshwood's.

34:00.747 --> 34:02.957
Are they as riveting
as the town council minutes?

34:03.041 --> 34:06.544
More so, and when I see all these numbers,
I can't help but perform my specialty.

34:06.627 --> 34:08.087
-Owl-chemy?
-Autopsies?

34:08.838 --> 34:12.216
Forensic accounting. Even messy divorces
have their silver linings.

34:12.300 --> 34:13.426
What do the numbers tell you?

34:13.509 --> 34:15.094
That Jeff Groves was telling the truth.

34:15.178 --> 34:18.264
Marshwood was in trouble, but Orson
wasn't stealing funds from the town,

34:18.347 --> 34:21.184
he was depositing his own money into
the city treasury to try and save it.

34:21.267 --> 34:23.352
So, if Orson wasn't embezzling the money,
who was?

34:23.436 --> 34:25.354
The same person who wanted Sandy dead.

34:27.190 --> 34:30.234
You were right. Orson wasn't the one
stealing from the town.

34:30.318 --> 34:31.944
And we think you know who did it.

34:32.653 --> 34:35.907
And we also think they tried to poison you
to protect their secret.

34:35.990 --> 34:39.035
Marshwood's a small place
and you're all close here, but

34:39.118 --> 34:41.704
-if you could tell us who--
-It was Jeff Groves.

34:42.205 --> 34:43.289
The attorney?

34:43.372 --> 34:46.292
Orson covered for him. I did, too.

34:46.375 --> 34:48.711
Because he knew you and Orson
were having an affair, didn't he?

34:49.921 --> 34:53.549
Jeff said he would tell my husband
if we turned him in.

34:55.218 --> 34:58.179
I should have told you sooner.
Earl knows now, but

34:58.262 --> 35:03.101
Jeff has pictures of me and Orson,

35:03.434 --> 35:05.103
-doing--
-We know. We're good.

35:05.186 --> 35:06.896
And there were costumes involved.

35:07.522 --> 35:09.982
And we'd gotten really creative
with the body paints.

35:10.066 --> 35:11.567
I mean, we're so good.

35:11.651 --> 35:13.528
If we told the truth from the beginning,

35:14.695 --> 35:16.405
Orson would still be alive.

35:17.198 --> 35:19.826
Or Jeff would have killed you both
for revenge.

35:22.453 --> 35:24.330
All I'm saying is,

35:24.747 --> 35:28.459
we do the best we can with
the information we have in the present.

35:30.044 --> 35:31.796
I think it's time we go talk to Jeff.

35:33.631 --> 35:35.508
No sign of Groves inside.

35:35.883 --> 35:38.719
And nothing to give us probable cause
to search his home.

35:38.803 --> 35:41.305
Except for the digitalis
growing in his front yard.

35:45.476 --> 35:47.562
Rosie, stand back.

35:47.812 --> 35:49.147
Rosie, where are you going?

35:49.230 --> 35:50.982
-Stand back.
-This is back.

35:58.781 --> 36:00.616
Over packing for a getaway?

36:00.700 --> 36:01.909
That's a first for me.

36:01.993 --> 36:04.662
You got to be prepared for anything.
Especially when you're on the run.

36:08.875 --> 36:10.751
I'm willing to cooperate.

36:10.835 --> 36:13.379
You tried to skip the town
you were embezzling from.

36:13.462 --> 36:15.756
And that means
we're way past cooperation, Jeff.

36:15.840 --> 36:17.758
And you were blackmailing
Orson and Sandy Langford

36:17.842 --> 36:19.552
so they wouldn't come clean
about you stealing.

36:19.886 --> 36:22.930
It's called mutually assured destruction.
It's a tactic.

36:23.014 --> 36:25.683
Like, I scratch your back,
you scratch mine.

36:25.766 --> 36:27.226
I've got my own back, thank you.

36:27.310 --> 36:30.771
I kept quiet about their affair,
they kept quiet about the stealing.

36:30.855 --> 36:32.023
Everyone was happy.

36:32.106 --> 36:34.692
Until one ended up dead
and the other one almost dead.

36:34.775 --> 36:37.236
Orson and Sandy were
honoring their promise to me,

36:37.320 --> 36:40.990
which means I had no motivation
to kill either of them.

36:41.866 --> 36:43.993
See, now would be the time
I would ask for a lawyer,

36:44.327 --> 36:48.831
if I hadn't already got the State's ninth
highest score in the bar exam. So...

36:48.915 --> 36:50.208
If you have no further questions--

36:50.291 --> 36:52.418
We tested the cup
that you found at Sandy's house.

36:52.501 --> 36:53.711
It totally is the murder weapon.

36:53.794 --> 36:56.964
Yeah, the digitalis was concentrated
in between the inner and outer layers.

36:57.048 --> 36:59.967
While the killer thought to wipe
their prints off the outer layers...

37:00.051 --> 37:01.719
They forgot to do the same on the inner.

37:01.802 --> 37:03.721
-So you have the killer's partial print.
-We do.

37:03.804 --> 37:05.890
Just call us the Matlocks of Marshwood.

37:07.600 --> 37:09.101
Do we have enough to hold Jeff?

37:09.477 --> 37:10.811
No, because he didn't do it.

37:16.609 --> 37:20.571
I appreciate everything you've done,
but really, I feel right as rain now.

37:20.655 --> 37:22.740
Well, I know you may feel fine, but

37:22.823 --> 37:26.160
your blood work indicated a larger dose
of digitalis than we anticipated,

37:26.244 --> 37:28.204
so, you mind getting up here
for a second, please?

37:28.746 --> 37:32.333
It actually was 8 milligrams per liter
over a one hour time period.

37:32.416 --> 37:34.210
That's not good at all.

37:35.544 --> 37:37.046
I'm not sure I understand.

37:37.129 --> 37:40.007
A large dose that concentrated over such a
short period of time

37:40.091 --> 37:42.885
can lead to internal bleeding,
among other things.

37:42.969 --> 37:44.053
You mind laying down, please?

37:44.136 --> 37:47.765
I'm afraid I've to give you an ultrasound
just to make sure that it's not too late.

37:48.808 --> 37:51.060
-Too late for what?
-To prevent organ failure.

37:56.399 --> 37:58.192
Let's see here...

38:00.569 --> 38:02.154
What's wrong? Do you see something?

38:02.822 --> 38:03.990
I do.

38:04.073 --> 38:06.033
It's something I've never seen before.

38:06.617 --> 38:07.994
What? What is it?

38:08.911 --> 38:10.121
I'm actually not sure.

38:10.204 --> 38:13.916
Now, this could be a tumor.
But given the size,

38:14.000 --> 38:17.211
I'd give you 25 to life.

38:20.715 --> 38:22.049
Don't worry, it's not a tumor.

38:22.133 --> 38:26.429
It's a large dose of digitalis that
you ingested in order to poison yourself.

38:26.512 --> 38:28.347
I didn't catch it in Orson's body because

38:28.431 --> 38:31.017
you administered it in small doses
over a long period of time.

38:31.100 --> 38:33.019
But this, this right here,
you were desperate.

38:34.228 --> 38:37.565
I guess we got too close for comfort,
so you had to throw us off the scent.

38:37.648 --> 38:39.859
What? Me?

38:39.942 --> 38:44.822
Well, you must just be nuttier
than a pecan pie. You know that?

38:46.115 --> 38:48.576
Are you sure? You're the one
that's throwing down the death stare.

38:48.659 --> 38:49.869
Because it's her fault.

38:50.494 --> 38:53.372
Before he saw you two weeks ago,
Orson and I had a plan.

38:53.456 --> 38:55.666
I was gonna leave Earl.
We were gonna be together.

38:55.750 --> 38:58.127
I finally got what I wanted.

39:00.087 --> 39:01.130
Orson.

39:01.714 --> 39:04.008
And I wasn't going to let you
take him from me.

39:04.091 --> 39:06.886
We had lunch. N-Nothing happened.

39:06.969 --> 39:09.805
Then why did he come back saying
he was sick of being an adulterer?

39:09.889 --> 39:12.767
And he needed to get rid of everything
in his life not making him happy,

39:12.850 --> 39:14.477
and that included me.

39:15.936 --> 39:18.981
I'll tell you why. Because even if nothing
happened at that lunch,

39:19.065 --> 39:21.442
seeing you made him think he and I
weren't meat to be together.

39:21.525 --> 39:23.235
Last time I checked, Sandy,

39:23.319 --> 39:26.614
your boyfriend breaking up with you
isn't an excuse to kill him.

39:26.697 --> 39:29.033
He was going to throw away
everything we had.

39:29.533 --> 39:31.660
because of whatever she said to him.

39:32.078 --> 39:34.163
Don't blame her. It's on you.

39:36.499 --> 39:38.417
Geez, Potts, you don't need my permission.

39:38.501 --> 39:41.712
-This is your town.
-Right. I keep forgetting.

39:43.672 --> 39:47.259
Sandy Langford,
you're under arrest... again.

39:57.937 --> 39:58.938
How you holding up?

39:59.021 --> 40:01.440
I'm not great. Awful.

40:02.149 --> 40:05.694
You know, feeling like
I got my friend killed.

40:06.737 --> 40:11.283
And tired, I guess. And hungry.

40:12.243 --> 40:14.120
Feeling guilty that I feel hungry.

40:14.203 --> 40:16.372
'Cause apparently,
I'm the reason Sandy killed Orson.

40:16.455 --> 40:18.499
No, no. No, you shouldn't feel guilty.

40:18.582 --> 40:21.544
As a matter of fact, you're the reason
that he realized that he deserved better.

40:21.627 --> 40:22.962
Yeah, but I could have come back more.

40:23.879 --> 40:27.007
And I could have probably seen
that something was off, before.

40:27.091 --> 40:28.509
You moved on.

40:29.051 --> 40:31.804
You moved on,
and if you hadn't have moved on, then...

40:32.138 --> 40:33.431
you'd have never joined the FBI.

40:34.306 --> 40:37.685
You'd never met Pip, and most importantly,
you would have never been working for me.

40:38.269 --> 40:39.895
And you wouldn't want that, right?

40:42.022 --> 40:43.482
-No.
-Good.

40:44.692 --> 40:46.735
In that case, I'll see you back in Miami.

40:47.486 --> 40:48.571
Okay.

40:49.697 --> 40:51.824
Wait, I totally rode here with you.

40:52.908 --> 40:53.784
Oh, yeah.

40:57.288 --> 40:58.205
Hey.

40:59.999 --> 41:01.167
Need a ride?

41:01.250 --> 41:04.336
I guess your brother just pep and ditched.

41:05.004 --> 41:06.672
All right, well...

41:07.882 --> 41:10.134
-Did the pep part work?
-Sort of.

41:10.217 --> 41:13.220
But he doesn't really know
the whole story about Orson.

41:13.804 --> 41:15.097
What didn't you tell him?

41:15.181 --> 41:17.558
About a promise that I made to Orson.

41:17.641 --> 41:18.976
About Marshwood?

41:19.852 --> 41:22.438
About being true to myself, you know.

41:23.272 --> 41:25.357
About you. About me and you.

41:27.651 --> 41:29.111
You wanna tell me?

41:29.904 --> 41:31.030
I do.

41:32.823 --> 41:34.200
Well, get in.

41:41.332 --> 41:45.044
So you're ready to go back
to whatever's waiting for us in Miami?

41:45.127 --> 41:46.128
Are you?

41:47.796 --> 41:49.507
No, I wasn't straight with you.

41:50.549 --> 41:51.884
About my brother.

41:52.510 --> 41:54.803
Truth is, he's not driving me crazy.

41:55.346 --> 41:58.140
He's not... well, anything.

41:58.224 --> 42:00.976
He sits on my couch all day,
playing video games in the dark.

42:01.060 --> 42:05.105
He doesn't eat, doesn't sleep,
and any time I try to say something,

42:05.189 --> 42:06.440
it just makes it worse.

42:06.899 --> 42:09.193
I'm afraid one day I'll come home and

42:09.693 --> 42:11.195
he'll be...

42:12.029 --> 42:13.697
Have you told him that last part?

42:14.657 --> 42:16.158
I can't...

42:16.534 --> 42:21.956
because... I'm afraid if I do,
he'll just run away again.

42:23.123 --> 42:26.210
Marcos has to get his head on straight.
And you can't do that for him.

42:27.378 --> 42:29.046
But what you should know is

42:29.755 --> 42:31.674
-it's not your fault.
-I know.

42:32.508 --> 42:37.888
So, when are you gonna realize that
whatever happens to Slade isn't yours.

42:57.950 --> 42:59.743
Hey, hey, remember what I told you.

42:59.827 --> 43:02.580
Whatever he is about to tell you,
it is not your fault.

43:02.663 --> 43:03.956
Hornstock, what's going on?

43:15.384 --> 43:16.719
It's gonna be okay.
