09:58.070 --> 10:02.208
Mr. Elliot would gladly pay for
honor of playing in Japan.

10:22.662 --> 10:27.466
Architecture beautiful. Society on
cutting edge of progress.

13:34.622 --> 13:35.656
How they hung?

13:36.991 --> 13:39.060
Wow! A world series ring.

13:54.275 --> 13:55.643
Jackass!

15:02.344 --> 15:05.313
By the way, what is his order
in batting?

15:19.895 --> 15:23.966
The spirit of baseball in Japan
is the same as in America.

15:52.995 --> 15:56.799
He welcomes all advice from most
honorable manager.

16:00.102 --> 16:01.570
Okay.

20:50.895 --> 20:52.497
Thank you very much.

23:15.375 --> 23:17.977
Oh Man! My aching back!

24:17.504 --> 24:19.673
It's like jerking off before sex.
Ball seems to be flying well.

32:41.980 --> 32:43.381
GOOD LUCK.

33:08.807 --> 33:11.309
Turn up your radio - It's Elliot.

33:18.783 --> 33:19.818
What was that!

33:26.224 --> 33:28.460
Front foot in, hand over.

33:36.168 --> 33:37.169
Way to go!

38:52.186 --> 38:53.721
Way to go!

39:13.675 --> 39:15.410
Be quiet!

39:15.844 --> 39:17.012
Concentrate.

40:54.510 --> 40:58.581
When the game is over
a fat lasy will sing to us.

40:58.848 --> 41:00.349
Let's go!

42:55.399 --> 42:57.200
He is becoming an
embarrassment to us.

42:57.667 --> 43:01.071
You do not appear to have
found the answer to the Giants

43:01.371 --> 43:04.007
As usual they stand between
us and the pennant.

43:05.208 --> 43:06.710
I beg your patience.

43:07.044 --> 43:09.012
Our patience is running out.

43:09.479 --> 43:12.115
And your CONTRACT is running out.

57:17.101 --> 57:18.403
White trash!

57:43.361 --> 57:44.596
What the hell are you thinking of!

58:52.097 --> 58:53.699
Suspend Elliot indefinitely.

58:54.566 --> 58:57.403
And consider yourself out, as soon
as a replacement is found.

58:57.870 --> 59:00.339
You have brought dishonor to team.

59:04.910 --> 59:05.878
Replace the runner

59:06.211 --> 59:08.247
Bring the doctor.

01:01:43.070 --> 01:01:44.471
I'm home

01:01:46.073 --> 01:01:50.277
Grandfather, grandmother, this
is my friend, Mr. Jack Elliot.

01:01:51.178 --> 01:01:52.479
We know who this is.

01:01:53.180 --> 01:01:55.149
You go too far Hiroko.

01:02:01.755 --> 01:02:02.706
Where is father?

01:02:03.123 --> 01:02:04.658
He is garderning.

01:02:19.840 --> 01:02:21.108
Is that you Hiroko?

01:02:26.046 --> 01:02:27.114
WHAT THE HELL?

01:02:27.848 --> 01:02:29.016
Don't be angry.

01:02:26.046 --> 01:02:34.021
How could you!

01:02:34.421 --> 01:02:36.624
You needed to see another
side of him

01:02:39.193 --> 01:02:41.062
This is not for you to decide.

01:05:38.474 --> 01:05:40.342
Teach him properly Hiroko.

01:06:05.635 --> 01:06:08.304
Why do you always put
people down?

01:06:08.504 --> 01:06:09.772
You always do!

01:06:10.339 --> 01:06:13.109
And try to fit everybody into
the same mold!

01:06:13.342 --> 01:06:14.277
Hiroko. Sit down!

01:06:14.644 --> 01:06:17.079
Try a little understanding!

01:10:39.377 --> 01:10:42.314
Looks like he's run
out of excuses.

01:12:53.646 --> 01:12:54.647
I'm sorry.

01:14:06.584 --> 01:14:09.089
Foreigner charming, foreigner romantic.

01:14:10.357 --> 01:14:12.993
And foreigner always leave.

01:15:21.963 --> 01:15:24.332
I would like to apologize
to you all.

01:15:27.068 --> 01:15:28.803
From now, on

01:15:29.136 --> 01:15:33.508
I would like to make an effort,

01:15:35.376 --> 01:15:38.212
To be a real member
of the team.

01:15:38.579 --> 01:15:42.850
And between us
I'd like to build...

01:15:44.919 --> 01:15:46.988
...A chopstick

01:15:48.523 --> 01:15:51.225
...an edge.

01:15:52.560 --> 01:15:53.695
...A bridge?

01:15:55.096 --> 01:15:56.097
A bridge.

01:15:57.165 --> 01:16:01.302
Build a bridge of friendship.

01:17:27.456 --> 01:17:29.091
It's only the 5th inning.

01:17:29.958 --> 01:17:31.126
Do you know that?

01:17:32.961 --> 01:17:34.630
Where's your answer!?

01:23:46.238 --> 01:23:50.242
Jack Elliot is challenging
manager Uchiyama's record,

01:23:50.476 --> 01:23:52.878
Which was set 18 years ago.

01:23:53.245 --> 01:23:57.483
Dragons are very close to winning
the pennant from the Giants.

01:23:57.983 --> 01:23:59.885
Isn't that fantastic!

01:24:01.854 --> 01:24:03.822
Why are you still here?

01:24:04.490 --> 01:24:05.724
I'm Working.

01:24:07.126 --> 01:24:09.695
But the game is about to start.
Aren't you going?

01:24:10.496 --> 01:24:11.630
No, I'm not.

01:24:14.433 --> 01:24:17.369
Foreigner charming, foreigner romantic

01:24:18.605 --> 01:24:20.406
Foreigner returning to America.

01:24:25.444 --> 01:24:26.545
I'm sorry.

01:24:24.813 --> 01:24:28.881
It's okay.

01:24:32.451 --> 01:24:33.719
See you!

01:24:34.553 --> 01:24:35.721
See you!

01:25:05.151 --> 01:25:09.122
Due to the importance of this game

01:25:09.789 --> 01:25:14.193
We have a list of strategies
we want followed.

01:25:14.661 --> 01:25:17.063
To my knowledge you have not
yet found my replacement

01:25:18.164 --> 01:25:19.866
Therefore, I am the manager

01:25:21.401 --> 01:25:23.436
I will manage the team.

01:25:26.639 --> 01:25:29.075
Now excuse me,
I have a job to do.

01:25:32.312 --> 01:25:34.081
If Giants win and...

01:25:34.214 --> 01:25:36.216
If Uchiyama San loses his record

01:25:36.649 --> 01:25:41.488
Dragons will lose face very badly!

01:25:47.027 --> 01:25:49.429
I feel good na na na na na na na!

01:28:20.782 --> 01:28:22.684
Park it!

01:31:07.984 --> 01:31:10.086
He stepped on the plate!

01:31:12.555 --> 01:31:15.158
I saw it, he's out!

01:32:06.977 --> 01:32:09.412
Giants 5. Dragons 1.
Middle of the 7th.

01:32:38.475 --> 01:32:40.010
Rally caps.

01:32:46.416 --> 01:32:47.718
Let's go.

01:34:59.617 --> 01:35:01.519
Giants 6. Dragons 5.
Two outs.

01:35:04.422 --> 01:35:07.559
The bases are loaded...
What will Uchiyama do?

01:35:17.269 --> 01:35:19.571
Uchiyama knows who
 pays his salary.

01:35:19.921 --> 23:35:21.673
He'll go for the bunt.

01:37:25.732 --> 01:37:27.700
WE KICKED ASS!

01:37:48.521 --> 01:37:50.790
We have won the pennant.
Thanks to you.

01:37:51.291 --> 01:37:53.526
You have brought great honor
to team.

01:37:53.693 --> 01:37:56.029
Then you will want me to stay
as manager?

01:37:56.663 --> 01:37:57.664
Please.

01:38:02.860 --> 01:38:03.827
Thank you.

01:39:52.413 --> 01:39:53.681
Can I come in?

01:40:10.898 --> 01:40:12.266
Nice place!

01:40:17.872 --> 01:40:20.241
I have come on behalf of Jack.

01:40:26.981 --> 01:40:28.916
He wants you to know...

01:40:32.120 --> 01:40:33.921
He loves you...

01:40:37.825 --> 01:40:40.962
And wants to discuss the
future with you...

01:40:42.931 --> 01:40:45.233
When your "jet's are cool."

01:40:47.635 --> 01:40:49.971
But he's like you, father.

01:40:50.839 --> 01:40:52.540
He will not change.

01:40:56.144 --> 01:40:58.246
Changes occurring all around

01:40:58.813 --> 01:41:01.082
Perhaps you should listen first.

01:41:03.985 --> 01:41:05.286
He is...

01:41:05.787 --> 01:41:07.622
A foreign ball player

01:41:08.023 --> 01:41:10.992
Who you are in love with.

01:41:12.827 --> 01:41:14.829
It doesn't matter.

01:41:15.897 --> 01:41:17.699
It does matter...

01:41:20.235 --> 01:41:22.037
More than anything

01:41:22.737 --> 01:41:24.539
Doesn't it?

01:41:25.807 --> 01:41:27.509
This is for you.

01:41:29.544 --> 01:41:33.682
Very nice of him.
It's not from him, it's from me.

01:41:34.816 --> 01:41:36.084
From now on...

01:41:38.553 --> 01:41:44.626
I want to speak to you from my
heart with no holding back.

01:41:47.796 --> 01:41:49.064
Father.
