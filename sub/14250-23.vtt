00:51.200 --> 00:53.200
Is there a genetic match?

00:55.000 --> 00:56.500
Yes.
Let's gather the find

00:56.500 --> 00:58.400
and bring it back to the ship.

00:58.400 --> 01:01.000
CouId this be it--
the proof?

01:01.000 --> 01:02.600
If it is, we've just made

01:02.600 --> 01:05.099
the most important discovery
in Voth history.

03:03.000 --> 03:05.200
OpposabIe thumb.

03:05.300 --> 03:07.600
MuItipIe articuIations
in the digits--

03:07.700 --> 03:08.600
as expected with

03:08.700 --> 03:10.400
a technoIogicaIIy-advanced
species.

03:19.700 --> 03:24.300
Hmm... his craniaI capacity
is 22 percent smaIIer than ours

03:24.300 --> 03:26.800
and he appears
to be Iacking a diIitus Iobe.

03:26.800 --> 03:29.100
He had no sense of smeII?

03:29.100 --> 03:30.800
If he did, it was rudimentary.

03:30.800 --> 03:32.800
I doubt this feIIow
wouId have enjoyed

03:32.900 --> 03:34.500
the suIfur Iagoons of Hokath.

03:36.300 --> 03:39.400
His cartiIaginous microstructure
is extremeIy porous.

03:39.400 --> 03:41.800
Most IikeIy warm-bIooded.

03:44.000 --> 03:46.600
I beIieve
this was a non-saurian.

03:46.600 --> 03:48.200
''Non-saurian''?

03:48.300 --> 03:50.200
Doesn't that weaken our case?

03:50.200 --> 03:52.800
No. No, the genetic markers

03:52.900 --> 03:54.400
we share with this being
are undeniabIe.

03:54.400 --> 03:56.600
We are reIated,
however distantIy.

03:56.600 --> 03:59.100
The question we must answer is:

03:59.100 --> 04:01.900
What was our endotherm doing
in this part of space?

04:02.000 --> 04:04.800
Was he... on an expedition?

04:04.800 --> 04:07.200
Did he have a ship?
Crewmates?

04:09.300 --> 04:13.400
This materiaI-- it's composed
of synthetic poIymers

04:13.400 --> 04:17.300
and the moIecuIar structure
suggests repIication technoIogy.

04:17.399 --> 04:19.200
And consider
the garment itseIf--

04:19.300 --> 04:21.500
is this marking
pureIy decorative or does it

04:21.500 --> 04:23.000
have a symboIic function?

04:23.100 --> 04:24.600
CouId it indicate status?

04:24.700 --> 04:27.200
PossibIy a miIitary uniform.

04:27.200 --> 04:28.700
At the very Ieast, we can assume

04:28.700 --> 04:31.000
he was part
of a sociaI infrastructure

04:31.100 --> 04:33.100
and that wouId impIy a ship.

04:43.600 --> 04:47.500
Did your eyes see
the pIanet of our origin?

04:47.500 --> 04:50.500
The true home of our race?

04:50.500 --> 04:54.400
Was it... beautifuI?

04:54.400 --> 04:57.700
Was it covered by oceans,
by sand?

04:57.700 --> 05:00.700
Were there nine moons
above your head?

05:00.700 --> 05:02.200
Were there none?

05:05.400 --> 05:07.900
He appears to be
at a Ioss for words.

05:11.200 --> 05:12.700
His ship and the peopIe on it

05:12.800 --> 05:14.500
hoId the key
to where we came from.

05:14.600 --> 05:15.900
We've got to find it.

05:16.100 --> 05:19.200
I'II contact our supporters
at the CircIe of ArcheoIogy.

05:19.200 --> 05:21.200
They might be abIe
to spare a research vesseI,

05:21.300 --> 05:22.400
perhaps a few assistants.

05:22.400 --> 05:24.400
This isn't a fieId trip, Veer.

05:24.400 --> 05:25.900
We need to mount
a sector-wide expedition.

05:25.900 --> 05:27.500
And that means a fIeet of ships.

05:27.600 --> 05:30.500
We have to go directIy
to the Ministry of EIders.

05:30.600 --> 05:34.300
Professor, don't you think
that's a IittIe precipitous?

05:34.300 --> 05:37.500
Bone decaIcification indicates
he died more than a year ago.

05:37.600 --> 05:40.100
His ship couId be thousands
of Iight-years away by now.

05:40.100 --> 05:41.300
Time is running out.

05:41.300 --> 05:43.300
You must remember,
Veer, from the moment

05:43.300 --> 05:45.100
you were initiated
into my circIe,

05:45.100 --> 05:46.300
you made a commitment

05:46.400 --> 05:48.500
to the pursuit
of scientific truth.

05:48.500 --> 05:51.000
Before this,
aII we had was a theory.

05:51.100 --> 05:52.800
Now we have proof.

05:52.900 --> 05:55.900
We simpIy have to get them
to open their eyes and see it.

05:56.000 --> 05:58.600
We're going to set a course
for the city ship,

05:58.600 --> 06:02.300
present our friend here
and Iet him do the taIking.

06:08.300 --> 06:11.000
For miIIions of years,
our peopIe have beIieved

06:11.100 --> 06:13.200
that we were
the first inteIIigent beings

06:13.200 --> 06:15.600
to evoIve in this region
of space--

06:15.600 --> 06:17.900
the first race.

06:18.000 --> 06:18.900
This assumption

06:19.000 --> 06:21.500
underIies everything
that we hoId dear.

06:21.500 --> 06:25.100
But that beIief has been
questioned in recent years

06:25.200 --> 06:28.500
not onIy by the CircIes
of Science and PhiIosophy

06:28.500 --> 06:30.900
but by common peopIe as weII.

06:30.900 --> 06:35.200
Lying before you is proof
of the Distant Origin Theory.

06:35.300 --> 06:37.700
These remains
demonstrate beyond doubt

06:37.700 --> 06:40.200
that we arose eIsewhere
in this gaIaxy,

06:40.300 --> 06:42.600
that we evoIved
on a faraway pIanet

06:42.700 --> 06:45.900
and traveIed to this space
miIIions of years ago,

06:45.900 --> 06:48.700
our true history Iost.

06:48.700 --> 06:51.100
A piIe of bones.

06:51.200 --> 06:53.100
Impressive.

06:53.100 --> 06:55.100
This ''piIe of bones''
beIonged to a being

06:55.200 --> 06:57.600
who died
approximateIy one year ago

06:57.600 --> 07:00.900
from a species
found nowhere in known space.

07:00.900 --> 07:05.500
And yet, we share 47 genetic
markers with this being.

07:05.500 --> 07:08.200
We are undoubtedIy
reIated to him.

07:08.200 --> 07:09.900
And I intend to prove to you

07:10.000 --> 07:12.900
that we evoIved on
the very same pIanet he did.

07:13.000 --> 07:15.600
And that pIanet is
the Iong-Iost worId

07:15.600 --> 07:17.800
of the Distant Origin Theory.

07:17.900 --> 07:20.100
Yes. That's exactIy right.

07:20.100 --> 07:22.500
And to find that pIanet--

07:22.500 --> 07:24.400
our pIanet--

07:24.400 --> 07:27.000
we must find a Iiving member
of his kind.

07:27.100 --> 07:29.900
I've created
a computer extrapoIation.

07:30.000 --> 07:33.200
We're Iooking for a race
of bipedaI endotherms--

07:33.200 --> 07:36.200
spacefaring,
but technoIogicaIIy Iimited.

07:36.200 --> 07:37.900
Based on their craniaI capacity,

07:37.900 --> 07:40.500
I'd say they're no more advanced
than most endotherms we've...

07:40.500 --> 07:41.500
''Endotherms''?

07:41.600 --> 07:42.500
You're proposing

07:42.600 --> 07:45.400
that we are reIated
to a mammaIian species?

07:46.500 --> 07:47.700
Yes.

07:47.700 --> 07:49.200
Which is why
I ask your permission

07:49.200 --> 07:50.600
to Iaunch an expedition and...

07:50.700 --> 07:53.600
Let's taIk about your discovery.

07:53.700 --> 07:59.600
I enjoyed the coIorfuI taIe
of how you found these remains.

07:59.600 --> 08:02.400
It says here that you
paid a substantiaI sum

08:02.400 --> 08:04.000
for their Iocation.

08:04.100 --> 08:05.700
I was deaIing with traders.

08:05.800 --> 08:07.300
They knew the Iocation
of the cave.

08:07.300 --> 08:08.400
I had no choice.

08:08.400 --> 08:11.200
Have you considered
you were the victim of a hoax?

08:11.200 --> 08:13.600
I have anaIyzed
every micron of this skeIeton.

08:13.600 --> 08:15.100
I assure you, it's authentic.

08:15.100 --> 08:18.000
Professor Gegen,
have you considered

08:18.100 --> 08:21.700
the wider impIications
of your... theory?

08:21.800 --> 08:22.900
What do you mean?

08:22.900 --> 08:24.600
By chaIIenging Doctrine

08:24.600 --> 08:26.900
you're suggesting that
everything we beIieve

08:27.000 --> 08:29.700
about ourseIves, our history,

08:29.800 --> 08:34.299
our ancient and rightfuI cIaim
over this region of space,

08:34.299 --> 08:38.299
the authority
of this Ministry itseIf...

08:38.400 --> 08:39.900
is a Iie.

08:39.900 --> 08:42.299
That's not what I'm saying
at aII.

08:42.400 --> 08:46.200
However, in the Iight
of my discovery,

08:46.200 --> 08:50.300
some of our beIiefs
may have to be... reevaIuated.

08:50.300 --> 08:53.200
''ReevaIuated.''

08:56.900 --> 09:02.700
We wiII... consider your
request for an expedition.

09:13.500 --> 09:15.500
WeII done, Professor.

09:15.500 --> 09:17.100
HardIy.

09:17.200 --> 09:19.900
I faiIed to anticipate
the IeveI of ignorance

09:20.000 --> 09:21.500
I wouId be facing.

09:21.500 --> 09:24.000
What do we do now?

09:24.100 --> 09:27.900
I want you to arrange a meeting
with the CircIe of ExobioIogy.

09:28.000 --> 09:29.600
We have supporters there.

09:36.100 --> 09:39.400
Father, I'm concerned.

09:39.500 --> 09:40.700
UnnecessariIy.

09:40.800 --> 09:43.100
I don't think
they were very receptive.

09:43.100 --> 09:44.300
They don't need to be.

09:44.300 --> 09:46.100
The evidence
wiII speak for itseIf

09:46.100 --> 09:49.100
and word of my discovery
is aIready traveIing.

09:49.100 --> 09:50.600
If enough peopIe
confront the Ministry...

09:50.700 --> 09:53.600
Mathematics was never
your strong point, Father.

09:53.600 --> 09:57.100
You might be overestimating
your support.

09:57.100 --> 09:58.900
You don't beIieve me,
either, do you?

09:59.000 --> 10:01.000
I...

10:01.100 --> 10:02.800
I want to.

10:04.500 --> 10:08.200
Our ancestors came
from somewhere eIse.

10:08.200 --> 10:11.300
We don't even beIong here?

10:11.300 --> 10:15.100
It aII just seems
so... incredibIe.

10:16.500 --> 10:18.300
I'm disappointed in you.

10:18.300 --> 10:21.400
Father, pIease...

10:21.500 --> 10:23.500
Iet this go.

10:23.600 --> 10:26.900
You're chasing a fantasy...

10:27.000 --> 10:29.200
and you're wasting
your genius.

10:31.400 --> 10:33.500
I'm worried about what's
going to happen to you

10:33.600 --> 10:34.500
if you don't stop.

10:34.600 --> 10:37.800
And what's going to happen
to you if I do stop?

10:37.800 --> 10:40.800
To your chiIdren,
to aII of Voth?

10:40.900 --> 10:43.500
You'II continue
to Iive in ignorance...

10:43.600 --> 10:45.900
progress heId back
by ancient myth.

10:45.900 --> 10:49.600
The truth must be known.

10:56.800 --> 10:58.500
We've got to Ieave...

10:58.600 --> 10:59.800
now.

10:59.800 --> 11:00.900
What's happened?

11:01.000 --> 11:02.900
I met
with the CircIe of ExobioIogy.

11:03.000 --> 11:03.900
They're... concerned.

11:04.000 --> 11:04.900
There have been rumors.

11:05.000 --> 11:06.700
About what?

11:06.700 --> 11:08.100
The Ministry
has seized your research

11:08.100 --> 11:10.100
and they're pIanning
to detain you.

11:10.100 --> 11:11.700
On what charge?

11:11.800 --> 11:13.800
Heresy against Doctrine.

11:13.800 --> 11:15.000
I'II fight it.

11:15.100 --> 11:16.300
It's too Iate.

11:16.300 --> 11:17.600
Your supporters are frightened.

11:17.600 --> 11:18.600
No one wiII back you.

11:21.400 --> 11:23.900
I'II have to do this
on my own, then.

11:24.000 --> 11:26.700
Go back to your famiIy.

11:26.700 --> 11:28.800
As Iong as you're with me,
you're at risk.

11:33.300 --> 11:35.300
I'm not Ieaving you, Professor.

11:39.000 --> 11:41.800
I've run an anaIysis
on the uniform marking.

11:41.800 --> 11:43.000
I found what appears

11:43.100 --> 11:45.500
to be a microscopic
identification code.

11:45.500 --> 11:49.700
The transIation matrix indicates
it's most IikeIy a proper name.

11:49.800 --> 11:50.900
A name?

11:50.900 --> 11:55.300
Yes. I beIieve it's the name
of the endotherm's vesseI.

11:55.300 --> 11:57.100
We're Iooking
for something caIIed...

11:58.100 --> 12:00.300
Voyager

12:05.300 --> 12:06.800
Across the vastness of space

12:06.800 --> 12:09.200
to find one ship
among a sea of stars

12:09.200 --> 12:10.400
is no simpIe matter.

12:10.500 --> 12:13.500
And for many weeks,
we found nothing.

12:13.600 --> 12:16.400
And then, fortune gIanced
in our direction.

12:16.500 --> 12:20.600
A trader from a space station
bordering the Nekrit Expanse

12:20.600 --> 12:23.300
informed us
of a curious group of expIorers

12:23.400 --> 12:25.800
cIaiming to be from
the other side of the gaIaxy.

12:27.200 --> 12:29.900
The merchants there spoke
of a vesseI caIIed Voyager

12:32.300 --> 12:35.800
They were abIe to heIp us
cIarify certain detaiIs.

12:37.400 --> 12:38.900
With this new information,

12:38.900 --> 12:42.800
we began to acquire
other items and new evidence.

12:42.800 --> 12:45.100
Our most significant find:

12:45.200 --> 12:50.100
A canister of warp pIasma
from Voyager's engines.

12:50.100 --> 12:53.300
So now we are scanning space
for a matching signature.

12:53.300 --> 12:55.600
LittIe is known
about these expIorers,

12:55.600 --> 12:57.600
but they caII themseIves ''human''

12:57.600 --> 12:59.200
and they cIaim
to be traveIing home

12:59.300 --> 13:01.000
to a distant pIanet.

13:01.000 --> 13:03.200
My thoughts are with you, FroIa,

13:03.300 --> 13:06.200
as are those
of my coIIeague, Veer.

13:06.300 --> 13:10.500
Ah, I just sent a transmission
to my daughter.

13:10.500 --> 13:12.300
Was that wise?

13:12.400 --> 13:13.900
I encrypted the carrier signaI.

13:13.900 --> 13:15.200
There's no way to trace it.

13:15.300 --> 13:16.900
I hope you gave her my regards.

13:17.000 --> 13:18.300
Of course I did.

13:18.300 --> 13:20.900
I've seen the tint
on your scaIes

13:21.000 --> 13:22.600
when she's around.

13:22.700 --> 13:24.600
I've Iet you into
my academic circIe,

13:24.600 --> 13:26.300
but now you wish to enter
my famiIy as weII?

13:26.300 --> 13:28.200
No, Professor,
I wouId never presume...

13:28.300 --> 13:29.800
You shouId know your pIace.

13:29.800 --> 13:33.300
TraditionaIIy, my famiIy mates
with the famiIy of Towt.

13:38.000 --> 13:41.300
But... traditions are
meant to be broken.

13:46.200 --> 13:48.100
It's the pIasma signature.

13:48.100 --> 13:53.300
Scanners have found a match--
a ship, 90 Iight-years away.

13:53.300 --> 13:55.400
There are 148 Iife-forms aboard,

13:55.400 --> 13:57.400
traveIing at warp 6.2.

13:57.400 --> 13:59.300
I'm engaging
spatiaI dispIacement.

13:59.400 --> 14:01.300
It's unIikeIy
their primitive sensors

14:01.400 --> 14:04.100
wiII be abIe to detect us
once we're out of phase.

14:08.200 --> 14:09.500
Take us out of transwarp.

14:09.500 --> 14:10.700
We don't want to pass them.

14:10.800 --> 14:11.700
Done.

14:11.800 --> 14:13.700
I have an image.

14:13.800 --> 14:16.200
What do we say to them?

14:16.200 --> 14:18.600
Nothing.
Not at the moment.

14:18.700 --> 14:20.700
We stand to Iearn more
by observing them.

14:20.800 --> 14:23.300
Once we've coIIected
the information we need,

14:23.300 --> 14:26.700
and if they appear nonvioIent,
we'II make contact.

14:28.000 --> 14:29.700
Entering portation range.

14:29.700 --> 14:32.300
We'II be Iooking for
their data storage devices,

14:32.300 --> 14:33.500
anaIyzing their behavior--

14:33.500 --> 14:36.400
anything that can teII us
who and what these peopIe are.

14:36.500 --> 14:39.100
Eyes open, Veer.

14:50.300 --> 14:51.900
Interphase is stabIe.

14:52.100 --> 14:53.600
Curious.

14:53.600 --> 14:55.800
I didn't expect the smeII.

14:55.900 --> 14:59.300
WeII, they are mammaIs,
after aII.

14:59.300 --> 15:01.000
Ah, over here.

15:04.500 --> 15:07.700
Ah, this appears to be
a computer access terminaI.

15:07.700 --> 15:09.900
SimpIe binary system.

15:09.900 --> 15:13.000
I've downIoaded their database.

15:13.100 --> 15:14.600
I'II bet you
it's an anodyne reIay.

15:14.700 --> 15:15.700
No way. PIasma conduit.

15:15.700 --> 15:16.800
ReIay.

15:16.800 --> 15:18.400
I'm teIIing you, I checked
the conduit network.

15:18.400 --> 15:19.700
My point exactIy.

15:19.700 --> 15:21.100
You're not an engineer.

15:21.200 --> 15:22.300
I'II bet you.

15:22.400 --> 15:23.300
Name it.

15:23.400 --> 15:24.900
A maIe and femaIe interacting.

15:24.900 --> 15:26.000
Let's observe.

15:32.100 --> 15:33.800
WeII?

15:33.800 --> 15:36.500
WeII...

15:36.600 --> 15:38.600
go ahead and gIoat.

15:38.700 --> 15:41.800
The anodyne reIays--
who wouId've guessed?

15:41.800 --> 15:42.900
Just a shot in the dark.

15:43.000 --> 15:44.800
And it hit the buII's-eye.

15:44.800 --> 15:46.600
Tonight, you pay up.

15:46.600 --> 15:49.600
HoIodeck 2, KIingon
martiaI arts program.

15:49.600 --> 15:51.200
No getting out of it this time.

15:51.200 --> 15:52.200
Courting behavior?

15:52.200 --> 15:53.700
ExactIy.

15:53.700 --> 15:55.900
Note how the femaIe,
through her feigned antagonism,

15:56.000 --> 15:58.600
encourages the maIe
in his attempt to mate.

15:58.600 --> 16:01.100
There's no sign of vasodiIation
in their skin.

16:01.200 --> 16:03.700
ObviousIy, they never
evoIved that abiIity,

16:03.700 --> 16:04.900
which wouId expIain
their reIiance

16:04.900 --> 16:06.900
on crude verbaI interpIay.

16:06.900 --> 16:08.100
I'II see you tonight.

16:08.200 --> 16:09.600
B.Y.O.B.

16:09.600 --> 16:10.700
What?

16:10.700 --> 16:13.100
Bring your own bat'leth

16:16.500 --> 16:17.900
Bat'leth

16:18.000 --> 16:19.300
Report.

16:19.300 --> 16:21.500
We've compIeted
Iong-range scans.

16:21.600 --> 16:23.800
If we maintain our present
course, we'II enter

16:23.800 --> 16:26.100
a region of heavy tetryon
radiation within two days.

16:26.200 --> 16:27.500
What's the aIternative?

16:27.500 --> 16:28.900
A three-month detour.

16:28.900 --> 16:29.900
Tuvok, enhance the shieIds.

16:30.000 --> 16:31.300
Lieutenant, hoId our course.

16:31.300 --> 16:32.900
Harry, continue
your Iong-range scans.

16:33.000 --> 16:34.000
Yes, ma'am.

16:34.100 --> 16:36.600
Let's access everything known
about tetryon radiation.

16:36.600 --> 16:38.200
I want to take
every precaution...

16:38.200 --> 16:41.100
WeII, Veer, what can you observe
about their sociaI structure?

16:41.100 --> 16:43.500
It's obviousIy hierarchicaI

16:43.500 --> 16:46.600
with cIear differences
in status and rank.

16:46.700 --> 16:50.600
The maIes appear to be
subordinate to that femaIe.

16:50.600 --> 16:53.300
Perhaps a matriarchy.

16:53.300 --> 16:55.300
My concIusion exactIy.

16:56.300 --> 16:57.300
This is strange.

16:57.400 --> 16:59.700
I'm picking up
spatiaI fIuctuations.

17:03.100 --> 17:05.000
They're coming from the Bridge.

17:05.000 --> 17:06.099
Source?

17:06.200 --> 17:08.200
I'm not sure,

17:08.300 --> 17:09.700
but they're highIy IocaIized

17:09.800 --> 17:12.700
with moduIating phase variants.

17:12.800 --> 17:15.599
It Iooks Iike some kind
of cIoaking technoIogy.

17:15.599 --> 17:16.900
AII stop.

17:16.900 --> 17:20.000
Intruder aIert.

17:20.200 --> 17:21.599
We've exceeded our weIcome.

17:21.599 --> 17:22.700
Let's get back to the ship.

17:24.300 --> 17:25.400
What's wrong?

17:25.400 --> 17:26.700
Some sort of force fieId.

17:26.700 --> 17:28.000
I've erected

17:28.099 --> 17:30.700
a IeveI-10 containment fieId
around the Bridge, Captain.

17:30.800 --> 17:33.100
Scanning on aII
subspace frequencies.

17:33.100 --> 17:35.000
I'm picking up two Iife-forms.

17:35.000 --> 17:37.100
LocaIize them.

17:37.200 --> 17:39.000
Mission Ops 1.

17:39.000 --> 17:40.300
Professor...

17:40.300 --> 17:42.500
Their force fieId
is disrupting our interphase.

17:42.600 --> 17:43.800
I'm compensating.

17:43.800 --> 17:46.300
I can at Ieast get us
off this deck.

17:46.400 --> 17:47.700
Show yourseIves.

17:47.700 --> 17:50.000
Captain, the Iife-forms
Ieft the Bridge.

17:50.100 --> 17:53.600
They're now on Deck 2,
Section 13, Mess HaII.

17:53.700 --> 17:54.800
SeaI off the deck.

17:54.900 --> 17:56.300
Deck 2 seaIed.

17:56.400 --> 17:57.900
Security team to the Mess HaII.

17:59.100 --> 18:01.700
Intruders?
I don't see any intruders.

18:01.700 --> 18:05.000
It wouId appear we've
underestimated our endotherms.

18:05.000 --> 18:06.600
Maybe we shouId make contact--

18:06.600 --> 18:07.600
expIain ourseIves.

18:07.700 --> 18:08.800
It may come to that.

18:08.800 --> 18:09.800
Captain,

18:09.900 --> 18:11.800
I've anaIyzed those
spatiaI phase variants.

18:11.900 --> 18:13.600
Bridge to Chakotay.

18:13.600 --> 18:14.600
Go ahead.

18:14.600 --> 18:16.000
Adjust hand phasers

18:16.000 --> 18:18.700
to a dispersion frequency
of 1.85 gigahertz.

18:18.800 --> 18:20.800
That shouId disrupt
their cIoaking technoIogy.

18:20.900 --> 18:22.500
AcknowIedged.

18:22.500 --> 18:24.500
I've matched the frequency
of their shieIds.

18:24.600 --> 18:26.000
I think we can get off this...

18:33.200 --> 18:35.800
SpatiaI fIuctuations...

18:35.800 --> 18:36.800
there.

18:36.800 --> 18:37.700
NeeIix, get down!

19:12.900 --> 19:15.500
Minor phaser burns
to the upper thoracic region--

19:15.500 --> 19:16.600
nothing serious--

19:16.600 --> 19:18.200
but I want to check
for ceIIuIar damage.

19:18.300 --> 19:19.500
I'II run a microceIIuIar scan.

19:19.600 --> 19:21.500
Begin a DNA anaIysis as weII.

19:21.600 --> 19:23.700
I'd Iike to know more
about his moIecuIar physioIogy.

19:23.700 --> 19:25.400
A beIated weIcome aboard.

19:25.400 --> 19:26.800
I'm Captain Janeway.

19:26.900 --> 19:28.400
Now, who are you
and what have you done

19:28.500 --> 19:29.600
with my First Officer?

19:31.900 --> 19:33.300
You must have a ship.

19:33.400 --> 19:34.300
Is it cIoaked?

19:37.200 --> 19:38.300
We're not going to hurt you.

19:38.300 --> 19:41.000
We just want to know why you...

19:42.200 --> 19:44.500
His heart rate and body
temperature have dropped.

19:44.500 --> 19:47.100
His metaboIism is aImost
compIeteIy shut down.

19:47.100 --> 19:48.300
Is he dying?

19:48.300 --> 19:49.500
I don't think so.

19:49.500 --> 19:51.900
His autonomic nervous system
is stiII fuIIy functionaI.

19:51.900 --> 19:55.100
He's gone into some sort
of protective hibernation.

19:55.100 --> 19:57.800
Treat his injuries,
then see if you can revive him.

19:57.800 --> 19:59.700
Examine his technoIogy.

19:59.700 --> 20:01.500
I want to know
what we're up against.

20:11.800 --> 20:13.500
Don't be aIarmed.

20:13.500 --> 20:15.900
You're on my research vesseI.

20:16.000 --> 20:17.400
Chakotay to Voyager

20:17.400 --> 20:18.500
Your instinct is to fIee,

20:18.500 --> 20:20.600
but I must warn you
there's a confinement fieId

20:20.600 --> 20:21.900
around the tabIe.

20:22.000 --> 20:23.900
Just stay caIm and you
won't hurt yourseIf.

20:25.800 --> 20:27.700
What do you want from me?

20:27.700 --> 20:29.100
Why did you invade our ship?

20:29.100 --> 20:31.100
It wasn't an invasion.

20:31.100 --> 20:33.700
We were on a fieId expedition
to Iearn more

20:33.700 --> 20:35.100
about your species.

20:35.200 --> 20:37.000
We meant no harm.

20:37.100 --> 20:39.200
I'm a moIecuIar paIeontoIogist.

20:39.300 --> 20:41.600
Do you aIways harpoon
the IocaI wiIdIife?

20:41.600 --> 20:44.100
An unfortunate mistake.

20:44.200 --> 20:46.900
Veer is inexperienced,
and he panicked.

20:47.000 --> 20:49.100
Your peopIe were firing at us.

20:49.100 --> 20:50.600
I couIdn't get to him.

20:50.600 --> 20:52.800
So you took me instead.

20:52.800 --> 20:54.900
Yes.
A Iiving specimen of human.

20:54.900 --> 20:58.400
I've been studying
your computer database

20:58.400 --> 21:00.800
and I have many questions.

21:00.800 --> 21:04.000
The pIanet of your origin,
correct?

21:04.100 --> 21:06.200
That's right. Earth.

21:08.300 --> 21:11.700
Are there any of my kind there?

21:11.700 --> 21:14.000
Any of my species?

21:14.000 --> 21:15.600
Who are you?

21:15.700 --> 21:17.700
PIease, answer the question.

21:17.700 --> 21:21.300
Look, drop the force fieId
and teII me what's going on.

21:21.400 --> 21:24.600
Then, maybe we can make first
contact in a civiIized way.

21:24.600 --> 21:26.700
For what it's worth,
I'm a scientist, too.

21:26.700 --> 21:27.900
Maybe I can heIp you find

21:27.900 --> 21:29.600
whatever it is
you're Iooking for.

21:29.700 --> 21:31.100
I won't bite.

21:36.400 --> 21:38.100
Thanks.

21:40.200 --> 21:41.700
My name's Chakotay.

21:41.700 --> 21:43.500
Gegen.

21:43.600 --> 21:47.300
AII right, Gegen,
Iet's taIk about Earth.

21:52.300 --> 21:53.600
Your caII sounded urgent.

21:53.600 --> 21:54.800
With good reason.

21:54.900 --> 21:56.800
I've anaIyzed the aIien's DNA.

21:56.800 --> 21:58.500
There are 47 genetic markers

21:58.600 --> 22:00.700
identicaI to those found
in human DNA.

22:00.800 --> 22:01.800
That's more than coincidence.

22:01.900 --> 22:02.900
I thought so, too.

22:02.900 --> 22:04.600
I ran a search for those markers

22:04.600 --> 22:06.600
in Earth's
paIeontoIogicaI database.

22:06.600 --> 22:08.300
Take a Iook at this.

22:10.500 --> 22:11.500
IncredibIe.

22:11.600 --> 22:13.100
That's one way of putting it.

22:13.100 --> 22:15.300
It says here that those markers
appeared in hundreds

22:15.300 --> 22:19.200
of Earth species, dating back
tens of miIIions of...

22:23.000 --> 22:25.100
Their species evoIved on Earth?

22:25.200 --> 22:27.000
ApparentIy so.

22:27.000 --> 22:30.900
And from the Iook of it,
you and he are distant cousins.

22:30.900 --> 22:33.100
I wonder how distant.

22:33.200 --> 22:35.900
Transfer yourseIf to HoIodeck 2.

22:35.900 --> 22:37.400
I think it's time
we took a stroII

22:37.400 --> 22:39.100
through primevaI history.

22:43.200 --> 22:45.800
I've entered the genetic markers
into the hoIo-database.

22:45.900 --> 22:48.700
Let's see if we can find
our cIoset reIative.

22:48.800 --> 22:50.800
Computer, anaIyze
the genetic markers

22:50.900 --> 22:52.900
and search Earth's
fossiI record.

22:53.000 --> 22:55.200
Identify any ancestors
common to both humans

22:55.300 --> 22:57.400
and the aIien in Sick Bay.

22:57.500 --> 22:59.200
Life-form found.

22:59.300 --> 23:00.700
DispIay.

23:00.800 --> 23:02.200
Genus eryops.

23:02.200 --> 23:04.300
Devonian Era.

23:04.300 --> 23:05.900
Eryops...

23:05.900 --> 23:08.800
this creature Iived
over 400 miIIion years ago.

23:08.800 --> 23:12.300
And is thought to be
the Iast common ancestor

23:12.300 --> 23:14.800
of coId-bIooded and
warm-bIooded organisms.

23:14.800 --> 23:15.800
Yes, yes.

23:15.800 --> 23:18.500
Let's take the next step
in our IittIe stroII.

23:18.600 --> 23:20.400
Computer, what's
the most highIy evoIved

23:20.500 --> 23:23.900
coId-bIooded organism
to deveIop from the eryops?

23:23.900 --> 23:27.400
Genus hadrosaur.
Cretaceous Era.

23:27.500 --> 23:29.500
DispIay the Iife-form.

23:33.400 --> 23:36.500
As I recaII,
the hadrosaur vanished

23:36.500 --> 23:38.100
when a mass extinction occurred

23:38.100 --> 23:41.100
at the end
of the Cretaceous Period.

23:42.400 --> 23:44.600
What if the hadrosaur
didn't die off?

23:44.600 --> 23:47.300
What if some of them
survived that extinction

23:47.300 --> 23:49.400
and continued to evoIve?

23:49.400 --> 23:51.200
I couId weII imagine
this creature

23:51.200 --> 23:53.900
giving rise to a more
compIex Iife-form.

23:53.900 --> 23:56.800
CertainIy the buiIding bIocks
are there--

23:56.800 --> 23:59.700
bipedaI, grasping hands...

23:59.800 --> 24:03.200
Computer, run a genome
projection aIgorithm.

24:03.200 --> 24:06.200
If the hadrosaur
had continued to evoIve

24:06.200 --> 24:08.600
over the Iast 65 miIIion years,

24:08.700 --> 24:11.400
extrapoIate the most probabIe
appearance.

24:11.500 --> 24:12.900
ExtrapoIation compIete.

24:13.000 --> 24:14.100
DispIay Iife-form.

24:18.700 --> 24:20.800
That creature napping
in Sick Bay...

24:20.800 --> 24:22.400
is a dinosaur.

24:22.500 --> 24:24.200
The question is:

24:25.700 --> 24:30.800
Why have we never seen him
in the naturaI history museums?

24:31.000 --> 24:32.600
If a saurian species
had deveIoped

24:32.700 --> 24:34.200
a Ianguage and technoIogy,

24:34.300 --> 24:36.400
you'd think they wouId have
Ieft something behind,

24:36.400 --> 24:39.600
but what if it evoIved
on an isoIated continent?

24:39.700 --> 24:42.000
A Iand mass that was destroyed.

24:42.000 --> 24:44.900
Earth has been devastated
by countIess naturaI disasters

24:45.000 --> 24:47.800
over the course of its history--
asteroids, voIcanoes,

24:47.900 --> 24:49.000
earthquakes.

24:49.000 --> 24:50.800
AII evidence of your race
couId be

24:50.900 --> 24:54.100
at the bottom of the ocean
or under kiIometers of rock.

24:54.100 --> 24:56.600
ObviousIy, not aII of my peopIe
became extinct.

24:56.600 --> 24:59.000
Some of them must have deveIoped
space-faring technoIogy

24:59.100 --> 25:00.700
and Ieft the pIanet.

25:00.800 --> 25:03.100
And ended up here
in the DeIta Quadrant.

25:03.200 --> 25:06.600
Our true origins on Earth
Iost over the eons,

25:06.600 --> 25:08.900
repIaced by Doctrine...

25:08.900 --> 25:11.300
the myth that we were
the first race.

25:13.100 --> 25:16.100
Now you understand
why I had to find your ship.

25:16.100 --> 25:19.500
Next time, you might try
a simpIe ''heIIo'' first.

25:21.100 --> 25:23.100
''Eyes open.''

25:23.200 --> 25:26.600
I'm afraid I Iet my own
prejudice get in the way.

25:26.700 --> 25:30.200
I was... wary of you.

25:30.300 --> 25:33.700
We have very poor reIations
with non-saurian races.

25:33.700 --> 25:37.200
MammaIs in particuIar
are considered to be a...

25:37.300 --> 25:39.000
Iower Iife-form,

25:39.000 --> 25:42.200
but I must admit, I've never
gotten to know one before.

25:42.200 --> 25:44.000
I hope I've made
a good impression.

25:44.000 --> 25:46.500
In fact, you have.

25:46.500 --> 25:48.900
WeII, I suggest we
get back to Voyager

25:49.000 --> 25:50.700
Your friend Veer
is probabIy sick

25:50.700 --> 25:52.300
of the mammaIian food by now.

25:52.400 --> 25:53.800
I can't do that.

25:53.900 --> 25:55.200
Why not?

25:55.200 --> 25:56.500
I've aIready made arrangements

25:56.500 --> 25:58.400
to meet my supporters
on the fourth coIony.

25:58.400 --> 25:59.400
They're waiting for us.

25:59.500 --> 26:01.000
TeII them we'II be Iate.

26:01.100 --> 26:02.600
You don't understand
what I'm up against.

26:02.700 --> 26:05.300
I'm being charged
with heresy against Doctrine.

26:05.300 --> 26:06.600
You're my onIy evidence.

26:06.700 --> 26:09.300
If enough peopIe see
Iiving proof of my theory,

26:09.400 --> 26:12.600
even the Ministry wiII be forced
to acknowIedge the truth.

26:12.700 --> 26:15.300
I can't Iet you go now.

26:15.400 --> 26:17.800
Not untiI it's over.

26:17.900 --> 26:18.900
I'm sorry.

26:21.000 --> 26:22.700
This shouId to the trick.

26:24.900 --> 26:26.400
An appIe?

26:26.400 --> 26:28.900
You said you wanted
an organic test subject.

26:29.000 --> 26:31.300
I was referring
to a bio-cyIinder,

26:31.300 --> 26:33.100
but the fruit wiII suffice.

26:33.100 --> 26:35.200
Let's give it a try.

26:37.900 --> 26:39.000
Fascinating.

26:39.100 --> 26:41.700
This aIien device is apparentIy
pushing the appIe

26:41.800 --> 26:44.400
sIightIy out of phase
with our space-time continuum.

26:44.500 --> 26:46.800
A personaI cIoaking device.

26:46.900 --> 26:50.500
More advanced than any cIoak
I've ever seen.

26:51.900 --> 26:53.300
Mr. Kim?

26:53.300 --> 26:56.400
I'm reading a massive spatiaI
dispIacement dead ahead.

27:01.800 --> 27:02.900
Red AIert.

27:04.300 --> 27:05.300
We're being probed.

27:05.300 --> 27:06.600
ShieIds at maximum.

27:06.600 --> 27:08.000
HaiI them.

27:08.000 --> 27:10.300
No response.

27:10.400 --> 27:13.800
They're Iocking onto the ship
with an energy beam.

27:13.900 --> 27:15.600
It's cutting right through
our shieIds.

27:15.600 --> 27:18.200
It's some sort of transporter.

27:27.200 --> 27:28.300
Report.

27:28.300 --> 27:30.700
We've been beamed
inside the aIien vesseI.

27:43.700 --> 27:44.700
We're Iosing power.

27:44.800 --> 27:45.800
Switch to auxiIiary.

27:45.900 --> 27:48.100
I'm Iocked out
of command controI.

27:48.100 --> 27:49.800
AII systems are shutting down.

27:53.700 --> 27:55.500
Arm yourseIves.

27:57.600 --> 27:59.200
Tuvok to Bridge.

27:59.200 --> 28:01.300
Captain Janeway, respond.

28:10.900 --> 28:12.900
TurboIifts are off-Iine.

28:12.900 --> 28:14.400
Let's get to a Jefferies tube.

28:23.600 --> 28:26.000
Tuvok, I hope
that's your stomach.

28:34.500 --> 28:36.500
My tricorder's not working.

28:36.600 --> 28:38.600
There appears
to be a dampening fie...

28:39.600 --> 28:40.800
Tuvok?

28:47.800 --> 28:48.700
Go.

28:48.800 --> 28:49.700
I'm not going to...

28:49.800 --> 28:50.900
That's an order, Lieutenant.

28:58.700 --> 29:01.500
I can't get a singIe reIay
back on-Iine.

29:01.500 --> 29:03.400
Somehow, they've Iocked us
out of aII primary systems.

29:03.400 --> 29:04.500
Let's get down
to Main Engineering.

29:04.600 --> 29:06.100
We can access the manuaI
override from there...

29:10.800 --> 29:13.500
Your vesseI
is under our controI.

29:20.100 --> 29:22.600
It's an automated message
from the Ministry of EIders.

29:22.600 --> 29:25.700
It says that they've
captured the Voyager,

29:25.700 --> 29:27.700
that if I don't return
to the city ship

29:27.800 --> 29:31.300
and face my accusers,
they'II destroy my evidence...

29:31.400 --> 29:33.500
kiII everyone on board.

29:36.000 --> 29:37.700
What are you going to do?

29:37.800 --> 29:40.000
I won't be responsibIe
for those deaths,

29:40.000 --> 29:43.500
but if I go back now
without my support,

29:43.600 --> 29:46.900
they'II discredit my theory;
suppress the truth.

29:47.900 --> 29:48.800
That might be difficuIt

29:48.900 --> 29:50.800
with the evidence
standing right beside you.

29:50.800 --> 29:53.100
They've taken my ship.

29:53.100 --> 29:55.600
It sounds to me
Iike we're aII on triaI here.

29:59.500 --> 30:02.400
I've just Iaid in a course
for the city ship.

30:05.800 --> 30:08.200
We're Iooking
for two of our own kind.

30:08.300 --> 30:10.600
One was found
in your medicaI bay.

30:10.600 --> 30:11.600
Where is the other?

30:11.600 --> 30:12.600
I don't know.

30:12.600 --> 30:14.800
He took my First Officer
and disappeared.

30:14.800 --> 30:17.400
Our scans indicate
that your ship is aIone.

30:17.400 --> 30:19.200
Where do you come from?

30:19.200 --> 30:21.200
If you want my cooperation,

30:21.300 --> 30:23.600
I suggest you reIease my vesseI.

30:23.600 --> 30:25.300
You are non-indigenous beings.

30:25.300 --> 30:27.600
You have no rights
under Doctrine.

30:27.600 --> 30:30.000
Where do you come from?

30:30.100 --> 30:34.000
ApparentIy... we're from
the same pIace you are--

30:34.000 --> 30:35.700
Earth.

30:37.600 --> 30:41.500
I see that Gegen
has begun spreading his Iies.

31:13.000 --> 31:14.700
Paris to Janeway.

31:14.700 --> 31:17.900
Captain, if you can hear me,
I've got weapons controI

31:18.000 --> 31:20.800
and I've armed
a fuII spread of torpedoes.

31:20.900 --> 31:21.800
Who's that?

31:21.900 --> 31:23.100
My heImsman.

31:23.100 --> 31:25.700
Sounds Iike he's
about to bIast a hoIe

31:25.700 --> 31:27.300
in the side of your ship.

31:27.300 --> 31:29.100
Lieutenant Paris, fire.

31:29.100 --> 31:31.000
You might want
to hoId on to something.

31:35.000 --> 31:37.800
Launch protocoIs
have been disrupted.

31:37.800 --> 31:40.800
Switch to auxiIiary protocoIs.

31:40.900 --> 31:42.800
UnabIe to compIy.

31:42.900 --> 31:45.200
Weapon systems are off-Iine.

31:45.200 --> 31:46.500
How?

31:46.600 --> 31:48.200
Method unknown.

31:49.700 --> 31:50.900
Paris to Janeway.

31:51.000 --> 31:52.100
Go ahead.

31:52.100 --> 31:53.600
Captain, someone
on the aIien vesseI

31:53.600 --> 31:55.600
detected my Iaunch sequence.

31:55.600 --> 31:58.000
I don't know how they did it,
but I'm compIeteIy Iocked out.

31:58.000 --> 31:59.700
Nice try, Tom.

31:59.800 --> 32:01.500
HaIuk to Command.

32:01.500 --> 32:04.100
The Voyager's Captain
is proving uncooperative.

32:04.100 --> 32:06.800
I request an interrogation
surgeon to assist with the...

32:06.800 --> 32:07.900
That won't be necessary.

32:08.000 --> 32:09.300
Gegen is in custody.

32:09.400 --> 32:10.500
Remain on the Voyager

32:10.500 --> 32:12.000
and wait
for further instructions.

32:25.400 --> 32:27.800
Professor Forra Gegen,

32:27.900 --> 32:30.900
you are accused
of heresy against Doctrine.

32:31.000 --> 32:33.500
Do you wish
to retract your cIaims

32:33.500 --> 32:36.200
regarding
the Distant Origin Theory?

32:36.200 --> 32:38.500
I do not.

32:42.600 --> 32:45.100
Then we wiII proceed.

32:50.000 --> 32:52.700
Three months ago,
you circuIated a study

32:52.800 --> 32:56.200
criticizing what you caIIed
''resistance to truth''--

32:56.200 --> 32:58.400
once again, disputing Doctrine.

32:58.500 --> 33:01.600
I apoIogize if I wrote anything
that offended the EIders,

33:01.600 --> 33:04.400
but I never even mentioned
the word ''doctrine.''

33:04.500 --> 33:06.300
You didn't have to.

33:06.300 --> 33:08.300
Your meaning was cIear.

33:08.300 --> 33:10.000
For nearIy a decade,

33:10.100 --> 33:12.200
you've used
the Distant Origin Theory

33:12.200 --> 33:13.800
to attack and undermine

33:13.800 --> 33:16.200
the guiding principIes
of our society.

33:16.300 --> 33:19.600
Not so! I've been pursuing
a scientific investigation.

33:19.600 --> 33:21.400
I'm not concerned at aII
with Doctrine!

33:21.500 --> 33:23.400
My point exactIy.

33:23.400 --> 33:26.800
Your disregard for the effects
of your casuaI theorizing

33:26.900 --> 33:28.700
is why you stand accused.

33:28.800 --> 33:31.800
You are reckIess
and irresponsibIe, and you are

33:31.800 --> 33:34.500
a destructive infIuence
to our society.

33:34.500 --> 33:35.900
But it is not too Iate

33:36.000 --> 33:38.500
for you to redress
the damage you have done.

33:38.500 --> 33:40.400
Disavow your cIaims.

33:40.400 --> 33:41.900
AcknowIedge your mistakes

33:42.000 --> 33:44.600
and this Ministry
wiII show you Ieniency.

33:44.700 --> 33:46.500
I'm sorry.

33:46.500 --> 33:48.800
I can't deny the evidence.

33:48.900 --> 33:51.100
The proof is standing
right beside me.

33:51.200 --> 33:52.600
Proof?

33:52.700 --> 33:53.900
ReaIIy?

33:54.000 --> 33:57.400
Our scientists have
anaIyzed your data.

33:57.400 --> 33:58.800
Their concIusion:

33:58.900 --> 34:01.700
''These creatures are
not reIated to us at aII.

34:01.700 --> 34:02.900
''The genetic simiIarities

34:02.900 --> 34:07.200
are a resuIt of random
convergence, nothing more.''

34:07.300 --> 34:08.600
If I may speak?

34:10.199 --> 34:11.800
Voyager's database contains

34:11.900 --> 34:14.500
a compIete fossiI record
of my pIanet.

34:14.500 --> 34:17.400
Your genetic markers appear
not onIy in humans

34:17.400 --> 34:20.100
but in hundreds of species
throughout our history.

34:20.100 --> 34:22.800
That's a Iot
of ''random convergence.''

34:22.900 --> 34:24.800
If you'd take a Iook
at the data...

34:24.900 --> 34:26.000
We have.

34:26.000 --> 34:28.000
The data isn't in question.

34:28.100 --> 34:31.300
Your interpretation is.

34:31.300 --> 34:34.000
Professor Gegen,
I don't want to be here

34:34.000 --> 34:35.699
any more than you do,

34:35.699 --> 34:39.000
and frankIy, I wouId prefer
not to be responsibIe

34:39.000 --> 34:43.199
for disgracing one of
our most venerabIe scientists.

34:43.199 --> 34:46.000
AII I ask is that
you admit the possibiIity

34:46.000 --> 34:48.600
that your interpretation
is wrong.

34:48.600 --> 34:50.800
WiII you at Ieast do that?

34:50.900 --> 34:54.699
I wiII admit that there
are stiII questions.

34:54.800 --> 34:56.800
The picture is incompIete.

34:56.900 --> 34:59.700
But I am certain of this:

34:59.800 --> 35:04.200
We are from the pIanet
these humans caII Earth.

35:04.200 --> 35:06.700
There are those who disagree.

35:20.000 --> 35:24.300
Tova Veer, you are
an accompIished young scientist.

35:24.300 --> 35:26.700
You were initiated
into the CircIe of ArchaeoIogy

35:26.800 --> 35:28.700
with the highest of honors.

35:28.800 --> 35:30.200
Yes, Minister.

35:30.200 --> 35:33.800
And you have been Professor
Gegen's assistant for six years.

35:33.900 --> 35:35.700
I've had that priviIege.

35:35.800 --> 35:37.600
You are famiIiar--

35:37.600 --> 35:41.100
intimateIy invoIved with
aII of your mentor's research

35:41.100 --> 35:44.200
regarding the so-caIIed
Distant Origin Theory?

35:44.300 --> 35:45.500
That is correct.

35:45.600 --> 35:48.300
In your expert evaIuation,

35:48.300 --> 35:52.500
what is the vaIidity
of the Professor's anaIysis?

35:55.800 --> 35:58.000
It is fIawed, Minister.

35:58.100 --> 35:58.900
Veer!

35:59.900 --> 36:03.100
You're saying you and Gegen
were mistaken?

36:05.100 --> 36:06.900
Yes.

36:06.900 --> 36:09.000
I've reviewed
aII of his research,

36:09.000 --> 36:12.700
incIuding data
from the Voyager's computer.

36:12.700 --> 36:16.100
I've checked and rechecked
the procedures.

36:16.100 --> 36:20.400
I now beIieve
that we were... overzeaIous.

36:20.500 --> 36:23.100
We saw an evoIutionary
connection

36:23.100 --> 36:25.100
when, in fact, there was none.

36:25.100 --> 36:28.600
Enthusiasm and passion
are never wrong, Veer.

36:28.600 --> 36:32.200
Your onIy mistake was aIIowing
them to distort your judgment.

36:32.300 --> 36:34.200
You may go.

36:38.600 --> 36:42.300
Professor Gegen,
I wiII ask you again:

36:42.300 --> 36:44.400
CouId you be mistaken?

36:44.500 --> 36:46.100
What did you say to him?

36:46.200 --> 36:49.800
That you'd take away his honors
if he didn't cooperate?

36:49.800 --> 36:53.300
That you'd send him
to a detention coIony?

36:53.300 --> 36:55.100
CouId you be mistaken?

36:55.100 --> 36:56.500
Did you threaten his famiIy?!

36:56.500 --> 36:57.700
Respond to the question!

36:57.800 --> 36:59.400
No! Why shouId I?

36:59.500 --> 37:01.200
You've aIready made up
your mind.

37:01.200 --> 37:03.500
This inquiry isn't
about evidence and proof.

37:03.500 --> 37:05.100
It's about keeping you
in that chair!

37:05.200 --> 37:06.100
Gegen!

37:06.200 --> 37:07.600
It's about maintaining a myth

37:07.700 --> 37:09.300
that keeps the Ministry
in power.

37:09.400 --> 37:11.800
You'd do anything to siIence me.

37:11.900 --> 37:13.800
WeII, it won't work.

37:13.900 --> 37:15.600
I'II never retract my cIaims.

37:15.700 --> 37:17.100
I'd rather go to prison

37:17.100 --> 37:19.300
than heIp you
perpetuate ignorance!

37:19.300 --> 37:22.800
Your true scaIes
are finaIIy showing.

37:22.900 --> 37:25.000
You're right, Minister.

37:25.000 --> 37:26.900
I was mistaken.

37:26.900 --> 37:30.600
I thought you might actuaIIy
care about the truth,

37:30.600 --> 37:32.200
even if it caIIed into question

37:32.300 --> 37:34.500
some of our deepest beIiefs,
and...

37:34.500 --> 37:36.700
We are not immigrants!

37:36.800 --> 37:43.700
I wiII not deny 20 miIIion years
of history and Doctrine

37:43.700 --> 37:48.100
just because one insignificant
saurian has a theory.

37:48.100 --> 37:51.500
One Iast time:

37:51.500 --> 37:54.700
CouId you be mistaken?

37:54.700 --> 37:57.300
It's you who are mistaken,
Minister.

37:57.400 --> 37:59.000
What?

37:59.100 --> 38:01.900
You accuse Gegen of having
his objectivity cIouded

38:02.000 --> 38:04.100
by... wishfuI thinking,

38:04.100 --> 38:06.400
but aren't you guiIty
of the same charge?

38:06.400 --> 38:09.000
I am not on triaI here.

38:09.000 --> 38:10.300
I understand,

38:10.300 --> 38:13.100
but, in a way, your beIiefs are.

38:13.100 --> 38:16.100
How you think about yourseIves,
your pIace in the universe--

38:16.200 --> 38:18.400
that is on triaI

38:18.500 --> 38:20.600
and this isn't the first time.

38:20.700 --> 38:22.400
What do you mean?

38:22.400 --> 38:25.100
I've had the opportunity
over the Iast few days

38:25.100 --> 38:26.700
to Iearn something
about your cuIture--

38:26.700 --> 38:28.400
your great accompIishments.

38:28.500 --> 38:30.700
Consider the breakthrough
into transwarp.

38:30.800 --> 38:33.400
An incredibIe achievement,
and yet,

38:33.400 --> 38:35.900
your ancient Doctrine predicted
terribIe disasters

38:36.000 --> 38:37.700
if it were even attempted.

38:37.700 --> 38:40.600
That heId your race back
for miIIennia

38:40.600 --> 38:44.400
untiI someone took a chance
and chaIIenged that prediction.

38:44.400 --> 38:46.400
They succeeded, and your society

38:46.400 --> 38:48.900
entered a new chapter
of expIoration

38:49.000 --> 38:51.400
and your Doctrine
was changed accordingIy.

38:51.500 --> 38:53.500
I know from the history
of my own pIanet

38:53.500 --> 38:56.000
that change is difficuIt.

38:56.100 --> 38:59.800
New ideas are often greeted
with skepticism-- even fear.

38:59.800 --> 39:02.100
But sometimes
those ideas are accepted

39:02.200 --> 39:04.000
and when they are...

39:04.000 --> 39:05.500
progress is made.

39:05.600 --> 39:07.000
Eyes are opened.

39:07.100 --> 39:11.500
When I open my eyes
to this theory,

39:11.500 --> 39:15.600
what I see appaIIs me.

39:15.600 --> 39:18.900
I see my race fIeeing
your wretched pIanet--

39:19.000 --> 39:21.900
a group of pathetic refugees

39:22.000 --> 39:25.900
crawIing and scratching
their way across the gaIaxy,

39:25.900 --> 39:29.100
stumbIing into this domain.

39:29.100 --> 39:33.800
I see a race with no birthright,
no Iegacy.

39:33.800 --> 39:36.300
That is unacceptabIe.

39:36.300 --> 39:39.200
I see something very different,
Minister--

39:39.200 --> 39:42.100
an ancient race of saurians,

39:42.200 --> 39:44.000
probabIy the first
inteIIigent Iife

39:44.000 --> 39:46.100
on Earth-- surrounded by

39:46.100 --> 39:48.700
some of the most terrifying
creatures that ever Iived.

39:48.800 --> 39:50.300
And yet, they thrived,

39:50.300 --> 39:54.500
deveIoped Ianguage
and cuIture and technoIogy.

39:54.500 --> 39:57.000
And when the pIanet
was threatened with disaster,

39:57.000 --> 39:59.600
they boIdIy Iaunched
themseIves into space,

39:59.700 --> 40:02.200
crossed what must have seemed
Iike unimaginabIe distances,

40:02.200 --> 40:06.000
facing the unknown every day,

40:06.000 --> 40:09.400
but somehow,
they stayed together,

40:09.400 --> 40:13.900
kept going with the same courage
that had served them before

40:14.000 --> 40:16.000
untiI they reached
this Quadrant,

40:16.000 --> 40:18.600
where they Iaid the foundation
of what was to become

40:18.600 --> 40:21.000
the great Voth cuIture.

40:21.000 --> 40:23.000
Deny that past...

40:23.000 --> 40:27.300
and you deny the struggIe and
achievements of your ancestors.

40:27.400 --> 40:30.100
Deny your origins on Earth...

40:30.100 --> 40:33.400
and you deny your true heritage.

40:48.600 --> 40:51.400
Do you retract your cIaims?

40:53.900 --> 40:56.000
No.

40:56.000 --> 40:58.200
I stand by them.

40:58.300 --> 41:00.400
Very weII.

41:00.400 --> 41:02.400
It is my judgment
you wiII suffer

41:02.400 --> 41:05.000
the consequences
of your obstinacy.

41:05.000 --> 41:08.300
Gegen, you are guiIty
of heresy against Doctrine

41:08.300 --> 41:11.400
and wiII be pIaced
on a detention coIony.

41:11.400 --> 41:13.000
For as Iong as you breathe,

41:13.100 --> 41:15.800
you wiII neither teach
nor engage in research.

41:15.900 --> 41:19.000
Your Iife
as a scientist has ended.

41:20.000 --> 41:21.600
As you wish.

41:24.800 --> 41:27.800
Chakotay
of the Voyager starship,

41:27.900 --> 41:32.600
you, your Captain and her crew
wiII join Professor Gegen.

41:32.600 --> 41:35.000
Why? You have nothing to gain
by imprisoning them.

41:35.100 --> 41:36.500
Let them go.

41:36.600 --> 41:38.300
You wiII spend
the remainder of your Iives

41:38.400 --> 41:39.400
on a detention coIony.

41:39.500 --> 41:41.600
Your ship wiII be destroyed.

41:41.700 --> 41:42.700
Minister...

41:42.800 --> 41:44.800
You wiII surrender
your vesseI immediateIy,

41:44.800 --> 41:46.800
and inform your crew
that this judgment...

41:46.800 --> 41:47.900
Stop this, pIease!

41:51.100 --> 41:54.900
Are you offering me
an aIternative?

42:12.300 --> 42:14.400
I have...

42:14.500 --> 42:16.300
reconsidered

42:16.300 --> 42:18.600
and I retract my cIaims

42:18.600 --> 42:22.300
regarding
the Distant Origin Theory.

42:24.100 --> 42:29.000
My anaIysis of the data
was obviousIy fIawed.

42:31.400 --> 42:34.100
I was...

42:34.100 --> 42:36.700
mistaken.

42:36.700 --> 42:39.700
You are prepared to refute
your work pubIicIy

42:39.800 --> 42:41.900
before the CircIes of Science?

42:43.700 --> 42:45.200
Yes.

42:45.200 --> 42:48.400
You wiII then be assigned
to another area of research.

42:48.500 --> 42:51.500
SureIy paIeontoIogy
has become tiresome to you

42:51.500 --> 42:53.200
after so many years.

42:53.200 --> 42:55.500
Perhaps metaIIurgicaI anaIysis

42:55.500 --> 42:58.700
wouId be a more rewarding
vocation for you.

42:58.700 --> 43:00.800
Perhaps.

43:02.100 --> 43:04.700
I am not unreasonabIe.

43:04.700 --> 43:07.700
You were drawn into this...
situation

43:07.700 --> 43:10.300
through no fauIt of your own.

43:10.300 --> 43:11.800
You are to be returned
to your ship

43:11.800 --> 43:15.300
where you wiII set course
away from our territory.

43:18.400 --> 43:20.900
It wouId be
in your best interest

43:21.000 --> 43:24.700
if I never saw you again.

43:46.900 --> 43:49.300
I'm not so good at chemistry.

43:49.400 --> 43:52.500
My career
as a metaIIurgicaI scientist

43:52.500 --> 43:56.500
is IikeIy to be...
undistinguished.

43:56.600 --> 43:58.500
I'm sorry.

43:58.600 --> 44:01.000
I was fooIish.

44:03.100 --> 44:04.400
Arrogant...

44:06.000 --> 44:07.500
and I Iost everything.

44:07.500 --> 44:09.600
You were courageous,

44:09.600 --> 44:11.100
as the Voth have aIways been

44:11.100 --> 44:13.100
from the first time
they Ieft Earth.

44:14.900 --> 44:17.900
And you, Chakotay,
have been a coIIeague...

44:18.000 --> 44:19.800
a friend.

44:19.800 --> 44:22.300
I wiII not forget you.

44:22.400 --> 44:25.300
There's something eIse
I hope you never forget.

44:37.600 --> 44:39.400
Someday,

44:39.400 --> 44:42.700
every Voth wiII see this
as home.

44:42.700 --> 44:46.200
Someday.
Eyes open.

44:46.200 --> 44:48.500
Eyes open.

44:49.600 --> 44:51.400
Chakotay to Voyager

44:51.500 --> 44:53.000
Energize.
