00:06.712 --> 00:08.540
Here I am, talking to you
like you're not a --

00:17.331 --> 00:19.594
What the hell
do you unlock?

00:19.638 --> 00:21.335
Just tell us where we can
find Morgan Jones.

00:22.989 --> 00:24.338
Where's the place
he's set up?

00:24.382 --> 00:25.383
Is that a kick?

00:25.426 --> 00:27.602
He is strong.

00:29.561 --> 00:33.086
Grace, do you hear me?

00:33.130 --> 00:35.654
These contractions I think
they're getting closer.

00:40.180 --> 00:43.314
♪ A candy-colored clown
they call the sandman ♪

00:43.357 --> 00:47.318
♪ Tiptoes to my room
every night ♪

00:47.361 --> 00:51.278
♪ Just to sprinkle stardust
and to whisper ♪

00:51.322 --> 00:53.106
♪ "Go to sleep"

00:53.150 --> 00:57.893
♪ "Everything is all right"

01:25.399 --> 01:27.009
What's wrong with you,
lady?

01:27.053 --> 01:29.229
Trying to
get yourself killed?

01:29.273 --> 01:31.101
You okay?
Thank you.

01:38.238 --> 01:40.197
Are you really sleeping
in a walker zone?

01:40.240 --> 01:41.502
Uh...

01:41.546 --> 01:44.070
I'm not so sure.

01:45.767 --> 01:47.117
Back up.

02:14.709 --> 02:17.147
Where'd you learn
to fight like that?

02:18.800 --> 02:21.151
My dad taught me.

02:22.456 --> 02:24.241
He's gonna kill me.

02:24.284 --> 02:26.460
I'm not supposed toe
outside the wall alone.

02:28.158 --> 02:29.376
We gotta move.

02:29.420 --> 02:31.335
There's a clinic
where I live.

02:31.378 --> 02:32.684
Doctor can
check you out.

02:32.727 --> 02:34.686
Maybe you hit your head
or something.

02:36.644 --> 02:37.950
What's your name?

02:37.993 --> 02:39.212
Athena.

02:39.256 --> 02:40.387
Athena?

02:40.431 --> 02:42.607
Like the --
Greek goddess.

02:42.650 --> 02:44.217
My mom
gave it to me

02:44.261 --> 02:46.437
because she thought
it would make me strong.

02:46.480 --> 02:47.916
What's your name?

02:47.960 --> 02:50.180
I...

02:53.531 --> 02:55.620
We better get you
to the clinic.

02:57.187 --> 02:59.406
Come on, lady.

02:59.450 --> 03:01.843
Let's go.

03:09.547 --> 03:11.070
Right there.

03:11.113 --> 03:13.203
That's where I live.

03:13.246 --> 03:16.162
No.
This isn't possible.

03:16.206 --> 03:18.556
How long
have you been here?

03:18.599 --> 03:21.820
Since I was born.

03:21.863 --> 03:23.778
How old are you?

03:23.822 --> 03:26.216
16. Why?

03:29.523 --> 03:32.526
We only just built this place
a few months ago.

03:35.007 --> 03:38.184
Hey, Max -- let us in?

03:38.228 --> 03:40.273
Come on.
Let us in, Max.

03:40.317 --> 03:41.927
What the hell,
Athena?

03:41.970 --> 03:43.885
Remember what happened
last time you snuck out?

03:43.929 --> 03:45.713
I know, but if I hadn't
snuck out this time,

03:45.757 --> 03:47.367
she'd be husk chum
by now.

03:47.411 --> 03:49.064
She needs
to see the doc.

03:49.108 --> 03:50.457
If you just
let me in,

03:50.501 --> 03:51.937
my dad won't even know
I was gone.

03:55.854 --> 03:57.334
Athena,
he already knows.

03:57.377 --> 03:58.726
You okay?

03:58.770 --> 04:00.598
I'm fine.

04:00.641 --> 04:03.253
What the hell
were you thinking?

04:03.296 --> 04:04.819
<i>Babaji,
I'm okay.</i>

04:04.863 --> 04:06.995
But I don't think
she is.

04:07.039 --> 04:10.260
Morgan?

04:14.394 --> 04:16.701
Have we met before?

04:20.008 --> 04:23.360
Incoming.

04:28.408 --> 04:31.455
Save the introductions
for inside.

04:34.458 --> 04:36.982
Come on, inside.

05:10.276 --> 05:12.452
Go find the doc
to come check on her.

05:12.496 --> 05:14.193
And we will
talk later about

05:14.236 --> 05:16.456
how you're gonna muck out
the stables for the next month,

05:16.500 --> 05:18.980
you hear?

05:22.201 --> 05:23.811
Are you okay?

05:23.855 --> 05:26.336
It's everything
you wanted it to be.

05:30.296 --> 05:32.777
You really
don't recognize me?

05:32.820 --> 05:34.344
I'm sorry.

05:34.387 --> 05:36.563
My memory is not
what it used to be.

05:36.607 --> 05:39.305
Morgan -- it's me.

05:39.349 --> 05:40.654
It's Grace.

05:40.698 --> 05:43.788
How do you know
about her?

05:43.831 --> 05:46.312
Because I <i>am</i> her.

05:46.356 --> 05:48.053
Why can't you
see that?

05:48.096 --> 05:49.750
I don't know
what you're trying to do here,

05:49.794 --> 05:52.274
but you need to sto--Morgan,
I swear it's me.

05:52.318 --> 05:55.539
The last thing I remember is
leaving this place with you...

05:55.582 --> 05:57.932
to go to the hospital
June was building.

05:57.976 --> 06:02.023
But this place, it --
it was different.

06:04.417 --> 06:07.246
If it's not me,
how would I know

06:07.289 --> 06:10.641
that we rode on a carousel
in a shopping mall?

06:10.684 --> 06:14.122
Or that you and Duane
used to race cars together?

06:14.166 --> 06:16.386
Morgan, it's me.

06:23.523 --> 06:25.177
Grace?

06:29.050 --> 06:30.400
Yes.

06:32.184 --> 06:34.839
Yeah,
this isn't possible.

06:36.406 --> 06:38.843
You can't be here.

06:38.886 --> 06:40.975
Why?

06:49.549 --> 06:51.551
Are you sure it's me?

06:51.595 --> 06:54.641
I buried you myself.

06:55.990 --> 06:57.949
How did I die?

06:57.992 --> 06:59.472
Your baby.

07:00.517 --> 07:02.040
The labor
took a lot out of you,

07:02.083 --> 07:04.390
and the radiation
made you sicker than we thought,

07:04.434 --> 07:06.914
and it was...

07:08.307 --> 07:11.441
I'm sorry. I tried to do
everything I could for you.

07:11.484 --> 07:14.400
And my baby?

07:14.444 --> 07:16.881
Is he...?

07:18.230 --> 07:20.406
Did he make it?
She.

07:20.450 --> 07:22.539
And she did.

07:22.582 --> 07:23.975
You've already met her.

07:29.502 --> 07:31.199
I should've known.

07:32.462 --> 07:34.202
Is she okay?

07:34.246 --> 07:36.030
Mm-hmm.

07:36.074 --> 07:37.945
I spent so much time
reading about

07:37.989 --> 07:40.121
how it could all go wrong
because of what happened to me,

07:40.165 --> 07:41.819
how the pregnancy
wouldn't last,

07:41.862 --> 07:43.777
how babies
could absorb the radiation

07:43.821 --> 07:45.953
-from their mothers.
-She's fine.

07:45.997 --> 07:47.694
Trust me.

07:50.567 --> 07:53.352
Before you passed, Grace,
you said you had one wish.

07:53.395 --> 07:55.049
That you wanted to know

07:55.093 --> 07:57.791
what Athena would be e
when she grew up.

07:57.835 --> 07:59.489
I don't know,
but...

07:59.532 --> 08:02.404
maybe that's why
you're here.

08:03.536 --> 08:05.016
People don't get
what they wish for.

08:08.149 --> 08:10.717
Sometimes things happen
that you just can't explain.

08:11.849 --> 08:14.721
She would love
to meet you properly.

08:16.027 --> 08:18.203
I can't --
We can't...

08:18.246 --> 08:20.205
We don't even know
what this is, Morgan.

08:20.248 --> 08:22.033
She asks about you.

08:23.034 --> 08:24.688
There's only
so much I know,

08:24.731 --> 08:27.038
so there's only so much
that I can tell her.
I know.

08:28.213 --> 08:30.258
But I think we should hold off
on telling her,

08:30.302 --> 08:33.087
at least until we know
what's going on.

08:33.131 --> 08:35.568
Trying to scare her,
Morgan?

08:35.612 --> 08:37.788
Usually I try to keep people <i>
out</i> of the grave.

08:37.831 --> 08:40.486
I was just giving her
the walk-around.

08:40.530 --> 08:41.966
This is Dr. Dorie.

08:44.490 --> 08:46.623
Doctor?
Well, self-taught.

08:46.666 --> 08:48.015
I was
a nurse before.

08:48.059 --> 08:49.843
He insisted
on the title change.

08:49.887 --> 08:51.541
Athena told me
what happened.

08:51.584 --> 08:53.194
Let me just
take a look.

08:55.109 --> 08:57.547
It doesn't look like
you have a concussion

08:57.590 --> 08:59.026
or any sign
of brain injury.

08:59.070 --> 09:00.201
What's the last tg
you remember?

09:00.245 --> 09:02.203
Um...

09:02.247 --> 09:05.032
Traveling on the road
with someone.

09:05.076 --> 09:06.730
And then...

09:06.773 --> 09:09.210
then it just starts
to get a bit fuzzy.

09:09.254 --> 09:11.038
Okay.
You'll stay here.

09:11.082 --> 09:12.605
You'll get some rest.

09:12.649 --> 09:14.520
Maybe some things
will start to come back to you.

09:14.564 --> 09:16.609
Hand me that wate.
Need to keep her hydrated.

09:16.653 --> 09:17.871
This is Charlie,
my apprentice.

09:17.915 --> 09:19.612
Charlie?

09:19.656 --> 09:22.049
My parents thought
they were having a boy.

09:22.093 --> 09:25.357
So did I.

09:25.400 --> 09:27.620
Thank you.

09:30.188 --> 09:33.191
It's gonna feel like
a lot of things have changed.

09:33.234 --> 09:34.496
Daniel?

09:34.540 --> 09:36.890
You don't happen to be
a barber, do you?

09:36.934 --> 09:38.849
I'm getting too old
for this.

09:38.892 --> 09:40.241
We all are.

09:40.285 --> 09:41.852
Maybe the next stray
you bring in

09:41.895 --> 09:44.550
will actually be able
to give a decent haircut.

09:46.726 --> 09:48.728
Are they actually...?

09:48.772 --> 09:50.512
Friends? Yeah.
Something like that.

09:50.556 --> 09:53.080
Dwight,
-how's the harvest doing?
Good.

09:53.124 --> 09:55.605
It'll be ready
by next week.

09:57.345 --> 09:58.608
Hey.

09:58.651 --> 10:00.044
Hey,
easy with that.

10:00.087 --> 10:01.611
Who'd have thought?

10:01.654 --> 10:03.656
He's more of a hellraiser
than I was at his age.

10:03.700 --> 10:05.615
I don't know about that, D.

10:05.658 --> 10:07.486
Morgan, did you get
the tomato seeds?

10:07.529 --> 10:08.792
Now's the time
to plant 'em.

10:08.835 --> 10:11.011
Oh, uh, yeah,
I will stop up at the seed store

10:11.055 --> 10:13.623
on my run
this afternoon.

10:15.929 --> 10:17.931
Oh, sorry.
This, um...

10:17.975 --> 10:19.324
Hey, I'm Dwight.

10:19.367 --> 10:21.108
Uh, Sherry.

10:21.152 --> 10:23.502
And this is Tina.

10:23.545 --> 10:26.940
And the boy over there,
that's John.

10:26.984 --> 10:30.422
It's so nice to see
such a happy family living here.

10:31.684 --> 10:33.164
We got lucky.

10:33.207 --> 10:34.774
Come on.

10:34.818 --> 10:37.864
Hey, don't forget
-those seeds.
-Seeds.

10:37.908 --> 10:40.214
Come on, bud.

10:44.001 --> 10:46.307
When did they
get back together?

10:46.351 --> 10:49.049
Not long after
Athena was born.

10:50.660 --> 10:51.791
And Alicia?

10:51.835 --> 10:53.924
Al,
everyone else?

10:53.967 --> 10:56.317
Alicia's running
a place of her own.

10:56.361 --> 10:58.624
She fixed up
the burnt-out stadium

10:58.668 --> 11:00.147
that she lived at
with her mom.

11:00.191 --> 11:02.715
And Luciana and Wes
went with her.

11:02.759 --> 11:05.065
Al --
Well, Al left a while ago.

11:05.109 --> 11:07.589
She said
she was chasing a story,

11:07.633 --> 11:12.812
but, uh, we all think
what she was chasing somebody.

11:13.813 --> 11:17.208
What?

11:17.251 --> 11:20.646
You know, I never did tell you
this from before, but...

11:20.690 --> 11:23.475
I didn't think
this was gonna work.

11:24.519 --> 11:26.304
I wanted to believe
like you did,

11:26.347 --> 11:28.915
but after the way we all
fell out with each other,

11:28.959 --> 11:31.091
and what
we were facing...

11:31.135 --> 11:33.659
I didn't think
it would happen.

11:33.703 --> 11:35.748
How'd you do it?

11:35.792 --> 11:37.968
What brought
everyone together?

11:38.011 --> 11:40.187
We were struggling.

11:40.231 --> 11:42.363
We didn't know
who was painting the graffiti

11:42.407 --> 11:44.278
or what
they would do to us.

11:44.322 --> 11:46.237
We couldn't even agree wih
each other how to face them.

11:46.280 --> 11:47.717
And then...

11:49.240 --> 11:51.459
...then you had Athena.

11:51.503 --> 11:53.200
And we lost you.

11:53.244 --> 11:55.028
Everybody forgot
their differences

11:55.072 --> 11:57.248
and rallied around
that child.

11:57.291 --> 11:59.250
They still do.

11:59.293 --> 12:00.773
I'm just sorry

12:00.817 --> 12:03.036
that you didn't live long enough
to see it happen.

12:06.518 --> 12:08.172
Me too.

12:13.699 --> 12:15.614
I think there's a way
that you can get to know her

12:15.657 --> 12:17.572
without having to explain
what's going on.

12:17.616 --> 12:20.575
I do.

12:22.099 --> 12:24.666
Athena. Athena.

12:24.710 --> 12:26.886
You want to go
on a run?

12:41.901 --> 12:44.208
I know what you're doing, <i>
Babaji.</i>

12:44.251 --> 12:45.687
Yeah?

12:45.731 --> 12:47.080
You think if you take me
to the feed store

12:47.124 --> 12:48.647
every once in a while,

12:48.690 --> 12:50.475
I won't
sneak out anymore.

12:50.518 --> 12:53.260
And do you think
it'll work?

12:53.304 --> 12:55.045
Yeah.
It might.

13:06.796 --> 13:08.754
"In Dreams"?

13:08.798 --> 13:10.712
Roy Orbison.

13:10.756 --> 13:12.758
That's what you're singing,
right?

13:12.802 --> 13:14.281
Yeah, I guess.

13:14.325 --> 13:15.805
Never knew
what it was called.

13:17.328 --> 13:19.765
I never go anywhere
without it --

13:19.809 --> 13:22.812
even though my dad says it's not
safe to listen to out here.

13:25.292 --> 13:27.120
Can I see it?

13:27.164 --> 13:28.339
No.

13:28.382 --> 13:31.342
I don't let anyone else
listen to it.

13:31.385 --> 13:34.084
My mom,
she wanted me to have it.

13:34.127 --> 13:36.826
It's the only thing
I have left from her.

13:39.393 --> 13:42.353
-Maybe not.
-What does that mean?

13:42.396 --> 13:43.876
Hold up.
-What?

13:43.920 --> 13:45.399
-What is it?
-Eyes and ears.

13:46.444 --> 13:49.839
Athena,
wait right there.

13:49.882 --> 13:51.666
Why is there a car here?

13:51.710 --> 13:53.146
Remember those pee
I told you about?

13:53.190 --> 13:55.888
The ones who attacked us
just before you were born?

13:55.932 --> 13:58.412
They used to leave
messages like that.

13:58.456 --> 14:01.241
Hey, we need to
get back and warn everybody.

14:06.812 --> 14:09.336
Morgan?

14:09.380 --> 14:11.948
I've seen this before.

14:11.991 --> 14:13.688
They used to be
all over this area.

14:13.732 --> 14:16.169
You probably saw something
like it a long time ago.

14:16.213 --> 14:17.910
No.

14:17.954 --> 14:20.608
No,
I've seen this before.

14:22.697 --> 14:25.396
The car.

14:25.439 --> 14:27.833
On a highway.

14:27.877 --> 14:29.922
The signs.

14:34.187 --> 14:36.450
You were there, too.

14:36.494 --> 14:38.844
It's just like --

14:48.898 --> 14:50.812
<i>Grace, wake up.</i>

14:50.856 --> 14:53.076
<i>I need you to wake up.</i>

14:57.341 --> 15:00.605
Morgan!

15:00.648 --> 15:03.216
Grace, are you there?

15:03.260 --> 15:05.349
<i>Grace?! Grace?!</i>

15:05.392 --> 15:06.480
Lady!

15:06.524 --> 15:08.091
We've got to
get out of here!

15:10.006 --> 15:11.529
Where is he?

15:11.572 --> 15:13.618
Where's your dad?!

15:16.099 --> 15:18.449
How far are we --Couple miles.

15:18.492 --> 15:20.190
Grace, can you hear me?

15:20.233 --> 15:21.756
Did you hear that?

15:21.800 --> 15:23.497
No. <i>
Grace...</i>

15:23.541 --> 15:26.196
Morgan?!
-Where are you?!
-You hear my dad?

15:26.239 --> 15:27.501
<i>I'm right here,
Grace.</i>

15:27.545 --> 15:29.155
There. <i>I'm right here!</i>

15:29.199 --> 15:31.853
-Did you hear that?
-Those are just
the husks.

15:31.897 --> 15:34.378
Morgan!
We're right here!

15:37.729 --> 15:39.949
<i>Grace, come on.</i>

15:48.044 --> 15:51.264
Morgan...
where'd you go?

15:51.308 --> 15:54.267
Please...

15:54.311 --> 15:56.226
where are you?

15:56.269 --> 16:00.534
Morgan...

16:00.578 --> 16:02.841
where'd you go?

16:02.884 --> 16:04.538
<i>Come on, Grace.</i>

16:04.582 --> 16:08.020
<i>Come back to me.</i>

16:08.064 --> 16:09.674
I'm right here!

16:09.717 --> 16:11.893
<i>Grace... Morgan?!</i>

16:11.937 --> 16:13.547
We have to keep moving.

16:13.591 --> 16:15.810
<i>Morgan?!</i>

16:15.854 --> 16:18.248
I can hear you!

16:30.651 --> 16:31.957
Lady,
can you hear me?

16:32.001 --> 16:34.220
Do you hear me?!

16:35.134 --> 16:36.657
Come on.

16:36.701 --> 16:38.485
The wall
is just ahead.

16:38.529 --> 16:41.358
I heard him --
I swear.

16:41.401 --> 16:43.012
Morgan.

16:43.055 --> 16:45.057
You're gonna
get us both killed.
Morgan!

16:48.974 --> 16:50.671
Come on.

16:50.715 --> 16:52.195
The wall
is just ahead.

16:53.718 --> 16:55.763
You just...

16:55.807 --> 16:57.330
killed him back there.

16:57.374 --> 16:59.767
We need to get back.

16:59.811 --> 17:01.291
No.

17:01.334 --> 17:02.727
No,
the wall is this way.

17:02.770 --> 17:04.946
It's this way.

17:04.990 --> 17:06.209
Morgan!

17:06.252 --> 17:07.775
What's going on?!

17:13.216 --> 17:15.218
Come on.
The wall's just ahead.

17:18.003 --> 17:20.223
Come on.
The wall's just ahead.

17:20.266 --> 17:22.051
Come on.

17:22.094 --> 17:23.269
The wall's just ahead.

17:23.313 --> 17:25.228
Come on.
The wall's just ahead.

17:25.271 --> 17:26.794
Come on.
The wall's just ahead. Come on.

17:26.838 --> 17:30.711
We're almost to the wall.
We're almost to the wall.

17:30.755 --> 17:33.584
The wall's just ahead.

17:33.627 --> 17:35.716
This isn't real.

17:41.940 --> 17:43.985

18:03.440 --> 18:05.920
What are you
waiting for?

18:07.400 --> 18:09.707
I was with Morgan
on the highway.

18:09.750 --> 18:13.014
I was en route to the hospital
June was building.

18:13.058 --> 18:16.714
The -- The car, it exploded
just like it did here.

18:20.109 --> 18:25.462
I'm unconscious.

18:25.505 --> 18:27.855
What did you say?

18:27.899 --> 18:29.118
Grace?

18:29.161 --> 18:31.729
Hey,

18:34.210 --> 18:37.082
I'm right here.

18:37.126 --> 18:39.867
What did you say?

18:41.869 --> 18:45.786
Grace, I need you to wake up
so we can deliver this baby.

18:45.830 --> 18:49.050
I can't do this
without you.

18:49.094 --> 18:51.357
Grace.
Grace, please.

18:51.401 --> 18:54.578
<i>Gonna figure out
where I've got you hid.</i>

18:56.971 --> 18:59.104
Wake up, Grace.

18:59.148 --> 19:01.541
You gotta wake up.

19:08.157 --> 19:10.202
That's why I kept hearing
Morgan's voice.

19:10.246 --> 19:11.682
He was trying
to wake me up.

19:11.725 --> 19:13.074
Morgan?

19:13.118 --> 19:15.033
Morgan,
can you hear me?!

19:15.076 --> 19:17.340
We need to get you
back to Dr. Dorie.

19:17.383 --> 19:19.211
We have to go
warn everyone.

19:19.255 --> 19:21.648
Why can't he hear me?
Morgan?!

19:21.692 --> 19:23.520
You're gonna draw
more husks.

19:26.523 --> 19:29.003
That's why
you couldn't hear him.

19:30.266 --> 19:31.571
You're not real.

19:33.660 --> 19:35.532
That feel real?

19:40.232 --> 19:41.625
It's in my head.

19:41.668 --> 19:45.194
It's just fragments
of different memories...

19:45.237 --> 19:47.892
things that
I've thought about.

19:47.935 --> 19:51.243
My brain's trying
to make sense of it all.

19:51.287 --> 19:52.636
I wanted it
to be real.

19:52.679 --> 19:54.812
I wanted <i>you
to be real.</i>

19:54.855 --> 19:57.118
Lady, you're gonna be wisg
for something else real soon.

19:57.162 --> 19:59.120
Why could I
hear him before?

19:59.164 --> 20:01.645
The car,
the explosion...

20:01.688 --> 20:04.082
I started hearing him

20:04.125 --> 20:07.390
when I saw things
from before...

20:09.174 --> 20:11.002
Hey!

20:11.045 --> 20:12.830
You won't hurt me.

20:12.873 --> 20:14.397
Give it back.

20:14.440 --> 20:16.312
That belonged
to my mom.
I know.

20:16.355 --> 20:19.140
I packed one just like it
to take to June's.

20:19.184 --> 20:21.142
To listen to
when I was in labor.

20:22.622 --> 20:25.016
You have a kid?

20:26.017 --> 20:28.062
I will.

20:29.542 --> 20:31.240
Come on, Morgan.

20:31.283 --> 20:32.763
Come on.

20:35.156 --> 20:37.289
<i>June?</i>

20:37.333 --> 20:39.900
June,
can you hear me?

20:39.944 --> 20:42.512
I repeat --
can you hear me?

20:42.555 --> 20:44.731
<i>Morgan, I copy.
Where are you?</i>

20:44.775 --> 20:46.429
<i>What's your ETA?</i>

20:46.472 --> 20:49.170
June -- thank God.
There's no ETA.

20:49.214 --> 20:50.476
We're --
We're not gonna make it.

20:50.520 --> 20:51.999
We got attacked
on the road.

20:52.043 --> 20:54.785
There was an explosion,
and people came after us.

20:54.828 --> 20:56.439
It's working.

20:56.482 --> 20:58.267
<i>We are now holed up
in a vet's office.</i>

20:58.310 --> 21:00.486
<i>Who, Morgan?
Who attacked you? It doesn't matter.</i>

21:00.530 --> 21:02.575
Listen,
Grace is unconscious.

21:02.619 --> 21:04.273
I need you
to tell me what to do.

21:04.316 --> 21:05.491
<i>How are her vitals?</i>

21:05.535 --> 21:06.840
She is breathing.

21:06.884 --> 21:09.060
But her pulse is weak,
best I can figure.

21:09.103 --> 21:12.368
But she was in labor
when we left.

21:12.411 --> 21:13.760

21:27.905 --> 21:29.036
It's a vet's office.

21:29.080 --> 21:31.561
It's at the junction
of 77 and 28.

21:31.604 --> 21:33.954

21:44.922 --> 21:46.880
Morgan, I'm here.

21:46.924 --> 21:48.317
I'm right here.

21:48.360 --> 21:51.102
How do I get you
to hear me?

22:03.680 --> 22:05.986
I gotta go.
I think they found us.

22:06.030 --> 22:08.946
Who?
Who found us?

22:18.042 --> 22:19.348
Something's going on.

22:26.267 --> 22:29.096
We're in trouble.

22:29.140 --> 22:31.316
What is wrong with you?
-Of course we're in trouble.
-Not here.

22:31.360 --> 22:34.275
There.
Morgan Jones?

22:35.712 --> 22:37.409
You've been
a hard man to find.

22:37.453 --> 22:39.846
Leave.
You're not real.

22:39.890 --> 22:41.718
It's not gonna
make a difference.

22:41.761 --> 22:45.025
We know
you're here somewhere.

22:45.069 --> 22:47.463
And you have
something we want.

22:49.465 --> 22:51.554
Morgan.

22:52.642 --> 22:54.208
I thought
this would bring you back.

22:54.252 --> 22:56.254
No, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no!

22:56.297 --> 22:57.429
Morgan!

22:57.473 --> 23:00.040
What did you do?

23:02.260 --> 23:03.740
You broke it.

23:03.783 --> 23:05.306
This is all I have let
from her.

23:05.350 --> 23:06.656
I didn't break it.

23:06.699 --> 23:09.093
It's not working
because Morgan shut it off.

23:10.529 --> 23:13.402
I need to find something else
that'll connect me to him.

23:14.881 --> 23:16.448
Are we near
77 or 28?

23:16.492 --> 23:19.277
77's close.
28's not much farther.

23:19.320 --> 23:21.410
-Why?
-There's a vet's office
at the junction.

23:21.453 --> 23:22.759
I need you
to take me there.

23:22.802 --> 23:25.762
Lady,
I'm not taking you anywhere.

23:25.805 --> 23:29.156
Take me there
or I really break this.

23:30.157 --> 23:31.507
Morgan Jones!

23:31.550 --> 23:33.073
I'm sorry,
Grace...

23:33.117 --> 23:34.510
I have to move you.

23:34.553 --> 23:37.382
<i>I'm sorry, Grace,
I have to move you.</i>

23:37.426 --> 23:38.688
It's working.

23:38.731 --> 23:40.733
Keep moving.

23:40.777 --> 23:42.692
We need
to get to that building.

23:42.735 --> 23:46.391
<i>So just show yourselves,
and this can all be over...</i>

23:46.435 --> 23:47.653
What was that?

23:47.697 --> 23:49.263
You heard it, too?

23:49.307 --> 23:51.657
Why wouldn't she?

23:52.919 --> 23:55.313
Who are they?

23:55.356 --> 23:57.402
I think they're the people
who blew up the car.

24:03.887 --> 24:05.192
Athena?!

24:08.544 --> 24:10.154
Athena!

24:12.896 --> 24:14.941
Aah!

24:14.985 --> 24:16.377
It's okay.

24:16.421 --> 24:19.206
It's just a contraction.
I think.

24:29.869 --> 24:32.350
You have
something we want.

25:03.686 --> 25:05.252
Where are they?

25:05.296 --> 25:07.472
Where did they go?

25:07.516 --> 25:08.908
It's okay.

25:08.952 --> 25:11.084
I think
they're contractions.

25:12.738 --> 25:15.088
What?

25:16.612 --> 25:18.439
Wait.

25:18.483 --> 25:20.920
Why are you
feeling them, too?

25:27.361 --> 25:28.928
I was wrong.

25:28.972 --> 25:30.887
You <i>are</i> real.

25:32.323 --> 25:35.282
That's the only thing
that makes sense.

25:35.326 --> 25:37.067
We're connected.

25:38.590 --> 25:40.766
I don't understand.

25:42.507 --> 25:45.118
I'm your mother.

25:48.382 --> 25:51.734
And I need to wake up
so you can be born.

26:03.920 --> 26:06.270
Why didn't you
tell me sooner?

26:06.313 --> 26:08.925
Because I didn't know
how to explain it.

26:08.968 --> 26:11.536
Because I didn't think
you were real.

26:11.580 --> 26:12.711
I am real.

26:12.755 --> 26:15.018
I know.

26:16.323 --> 26:18.804
I'm sorry
I took your tape recorder.

26:20.110 --> 26:22.025
Sorry I poked you
with my stick.

26:27.639 --> 26:30.599
So what happens
when you wake up?

26:30.642 --> 26:32.383
I think all this...

26:32.426 --> 26:33.732
goes away.

26:34.733 --> 26:36.561
It's not fair.

26:36.605 --> 26:38.650
I just found out.

26:38.694 --> 26:41.392
There's so much
I want to know.

26:42.698 --> 26:45.352
Guess I'll just have to ask
when I'm older.

26:47.833 --> 26:49.618
Right.

26:49.661 --> 26:52.577
You'll just
have to wait.

26:52.621 --> 26:54.666
It's happening like this
for a reason.

26:54.710 --> 26:57.538
I need to wake up
so you'll be okay.

27:02.848 --> 27:05.111
It'll take hours on foot.
It's too far.

27:30.223 --> 27:33.749
Why was my dad
playing that song for you?

27:33.792 --> 27:35.968
Wherever we really are.

27:36.012 --> 27:38.318
It was one of
your dad's favorites.

27:38.362 --> 27:40.146
I've heard him
singing it.

27:40.190 --> 27:41.321
No.

27:41.365 --> 27:42.714
Not Morgan.

27:42.758 --> 27:45.543
I was talking about
your biological dad.

27:46.544 --> 27:49.068
What was he like?

27:49.112 --> 27:53.507
His name was Matthew,
and he was kind and...

27:53.551 --> 27:55.379
handsome and smart.

27:55.422 --> 27:57.990
Big Roy Orbison fan.

28:02.821 --> 28:05.563
What happened to him?

28:05.606 --> 28:08.740
We worked
at a power plant together.

28:08.784 --> 28:10.829
He got exposed
to some radiation

28:10.873 --> 28:12.135
that made him very sick.

28:12.178 --> 28:13.876
I lost him

28:13.919 --> 28:16.530
before we got as close as
either one of us would've liked.

28:16.574 --> 28:19.620
But I'll always be grateful
we had what we did.

28:19.664 --> 28:22.711
Without him,
I wouldn't have you.

28:27.193 --> 28:28.891
<i>Grace.</i>

28:28.934 --> 28:31.545
<i>Grace, can you hear me?</i>

28:31.589 --> 28:33.373
It's working.

28:33.417 --> 28:34.984
He's close.

28:35.027 --> 28:37.551
You gotta wake up.

28:37.595 --> 28:39.249
You gotta.
They're gonna find us.

28:39.292 --> 28:41.294
Get going! Go!

28:41.338 --> 28:43.253
We don't have
much time.

28:43.296 --> 28:45.559
Get in there!

28:45.603 --> 28:48.475
Break it down!

28:54.351 --> 28:55.918
Wake up, Grace.

28:57.571 --> 28:59.486
<i>Wake up, Grace.</i>

28:59.530 --> 29:01.488
Morgan?

29:01.532 --> 29:03.534
<i>Grace?</i>

29:03.577 --> 29:05.188
The stables.

29:05.231 --> 29:07.756
We're here.

29:43.095 --> 29:45.663
What's wrong?

29:47.099 --> 29:50.799
This may be the only time
I have with you, Athena.

29:52.888 --> 29:55.629
Before...

29:57.153 --> 29:58.981
I didn't
tell you everything.

29:59.024 --> 30:02.898
There's a reason
why my...

30:02.941 --> 30:04.464
why <i>our</i> subconscious

30:04.508 --> 30:06.423
created this place
the way it did.

30:06.466 --> 30:08.164
Why I wasn't
a part of it.

30:08.207 --> 30:10.862
Why my grave
was behind the wall.

30:10.906 --> 30:15.432
Out there,
in the real world...

30:15.475 --> 30:17.173
I'm sick.

30:17.216 --> 30:20.611
I was exposed to radiation
just like Matthew.

30:23.309 --> 30:24.658
I survived long enough

30:24.702 --> 30:26.835
for you to grow inside me,
but...

30:26.878 --> 30:29.576
I don't think
I have much longer.

30:33.885 --> 30:37.410
I don't think you're gonna
get the chance to know me.

30:38.934 --> 30:40.892
No.

30:40.936 --> 30:43.155
No, you can get better.

30:43.199 --> 30:45.157
People don't get better

30:45.201 --> 30:47.899
with the kind of stuff
I've been exposed to.

30:50.206 --> 30:53.818
I know
why I'm here.

30:53.862 --> 30:55.428
I was so scared

30:55.472 --> 30:58.431
that you'd be born into a world
that didn't deserve you.

30:58.475 --> 31:00.259
Where I couldn't
protect you.

31:00.303 --> 31:04.220
But now I know that
you're gonna be okay without me.

31:04.263 --> 31:05.830
No.
Because you're strong.

31:05.874 --> 31:07.614
You are so strong.

31:10.791 --> 31:13.403
And you're gonna
bring everyone together.

31:15.448 --> 31:17.798
You're gonna be
the hope they need.

31:21.628 --> 31:23.804
Come on.

31:26.590 --> 31:28.461
Do you know
the real reason why

31:28.505 --> 31:31.290
I was outside the wall
when I found you?

31:32.901 --> 31:35.251
I was worried
about my dad.

31:36.774 --> 31:39.603
About Morgan.

31:39.646 --> 31:43.563
I thought if I went out
looking for seeds...

31:43.607 --> 31:45.348
then he
wouldn't have to.

31:45.391 --> 31:48.568
I don't want to grow up
without my parents.

31:48.612 --> 31:50.179
And you won't have to.

31:50.222 --> 31:53.399
Morgan, everyone,
they're gonna raise you

31:53.443 --> 31:55.924
just like
they did here.

32:02.669 --> 32:04.541
You got nowhere to go.

32:04.584 --> 32:06.978
Now how about
giving us what we came for?

32:08.545 --> 32:09.938
Grace,
you gotta wake up.

32:09.981 --> 32:11.069
They're gonna find us.

32:17.858 --> 32:19.382
Get behind me.

32:19.425 --> 32:20.513
We gotta get through the
and inside.

32:20.557 --> 32:21.950
No.

32:21.993 --> 32:24.256
This isn't just the only time
you have with me.

32:24.300 --> 32:26.258
It might be
all I have with you.

32:29.000 --> 32:31.524
And I'm gonna fight
for every second of it.

32:52.458 --> 32:54.895
You should turn around
and leave now.

32:54.939 --> 32:56.985
<i>Turn around
and leave now.</i>

32:57.028 --> 32:59.509
Hand over
that key you're wearing...

32:59.552 --> 33:01.337
and this all
goes away.

33:01.380 --> 33:03.600
We've been looking for that key
for a while.

33:03.643 --> 33:05.384
Hired someone
to find it.

33:05.428 --> 33:07.473
Even sent
two friends after him

33:07.517 --> 33:09.084
when he didn't deliver.

33:09.127 --> 33:11.216
I'm guessing
you had something to do

33:11.260 --> 33:12.478
with why none of them
came back.

33:12.522 --> 33:14.176
Just leave.

33:14.219 --> 33:16.569
Or I will do to yu
what I did to them.

33:18.093 --> 33:20.921
That key
is gonna change everything.

33:20.965 --> 33:23.054
We're not leaving
without it.

33:50.125 --> 33:52.388
Mom, look out!

34:21.373 --> 34:22.766
You can't stop us.

34:22.809 --> 34:25.638
I think I just did.

34:33.777 --> 34:36.171
Mom...

34:40.610 --> 34:42.568
How'd you get that?

34:42.612 --> 34:45.963
My dad, Morgan, he gave it to me
when I was little.

34:46.006 --> 34:47.834
He said to wear it
as a reminder.

34:47.878 --> 34:49.271
Of what?

34:49.314 --> 34:51.055
The cost of peace.

34:51.099 --> 34:53.840
What does that mean?

34:59.890 --> 35:01.152
Mom!

35:04.112 --> 35:06.157
Grace, hang on.

35:07.854 --> 35:09.378
What's wrong?!

35:09.421 --> 35:11.162
Mom?!

35:14.731 --> 35:17.125
June,
she's not breathing.

35:24.044 --> 35:26.960
<i>She's not breathing.
I'm losing her.</i>

35:27.004 --> 35:29.224
You're already dead!

35:29.267 --> 35:31.704
You both are.

35:37.667 --> 35:40.060
She's not breathing.

35:41.279 --> 35:43.542
<i>Come on, Grace.
Come on.</i>

35:50.201 --> 35:52.072
<i>Grace, come on.</i>

35:57.252 --> 36:00.211
I know you thought
this would end differently...

36:00.255 --> 36:01.908
Come on, Grace.

36:01.952 --> 36:03.214
Come on.

36:04.650 --> 36:08.045
<i>Breathe! Breathe!</i>

36:10.874 --> 36:12.571
...but that
was just a dream.

36:12.615 --> 36:15.357
I will never give up on you,
Grace.

36:21.276 --> 36:23.626
You found us.

36:29.022 --> 36:31.155
He's here for me.

36:31.199 --> 36:33.201
We don't have much time.

36:48.128 --> 36:49.782
Are you ready?

36:54.309 --> 36:57.747
I don't want
to say goodbye.

36:57.790 --> 36:59.531
But I have to.

36:59.575 --> 37:03.231
Come on,
stay with me.

37:03.274 --> 37:05.320
Stay with me.

37:05.363 --> 37:07.235
Come back.

37:13.110 --> 37:14.894
Even if
I'm not there,

37:14.938 --> 37:19.116
I know you're gonna build
everything that we couldn't.

37:33.130 --> 37:34.392
Please...

37:34.436 --> 37:37.308
come back to me.

37:41.138 --> 37:43.836
Remember this
when you get older.

37:47.362 --> 37:48.711
I will.

37:50.365 --> 37:53.106
You can
make sure of it.

37:55.848 --> 37:58.416
Record what you want me
to remember.

38:00.984 --> 38:04.640
Come back to me,
Grace.

38:04.683 --> 38:06.337
Please.

38:06.381 --> 38:07.773
<i>Come back to me.</i>

38:07.817 --> 38:11.386
I love you,
Athena.

38:11.429 --> 38:14.258
I always will.

38:14.302 --> 38:17.043
<i>Come back to me.</i>

38:18.523 --> 38:20.351
I don't want
to lose you.

38:20.395 --> 38:21.700
You won't.

38:21.744 --> 38:24.616
You never will.

38:24.660 --> 38:27.010
You don't
have to be afraid.

38:29.447 --> 38:31.710
I'll always
be with you.

38:37.281 --> 38:39.762
You can let go,
my angel.

39:03.220 --> 39:04.874
Well,
good morning.

39:04.917 --> 39:07.311
Oh, you're awake,
you're awake.

39:08.660 --> 39:10.009
I'm here, Morgan.

39:10.053 --> 39:13.665
I thought
I lost you.

39:13.709 --> 39:16.668
I had to come back.

39:16.712 --> 39:19.715
So that
Athena could be born.

39:19.758 --> 39:22.282
Athena?

39:22.326 --> 39:25.503
It's a girl,
Morgan.

39:27.026 --> 39:30.378
I'm gonna have
a girl.

39:30.421 --> 39:33.424
I'm gonna have
a daughter.

39:36.688 --> 39:39.038
I don't think
I'm gonna survive this.

39:39.082 --> 39:40.300
No.

39:40.344 --> 39:41.650
You don't know that --

39:41.693 --> 39:44.609
I do.
I saw it.

39:46.263 --> 39:48.091
You saw what?

39:48.134 --> 39:50.920
The future.

39:54.445 --> 39:57.100
Her future.

39:59.102 --> 40:02.279
Everything's going to
be okay.

40:05.761 --> 40:08.111
Because of her.

40:17.381 --> 40:21.385
There's a playlist of songs
I left on this tape.

40:21.429 --> 40:26.259
I hope when you listen to them,
they'll make you smile.

40:27.739 --> 40:30.873
Make you feel like
I'm right there with you.

40:32.527 --> 40:34.877
Because I will be.

40:36.139 --> 40:38.794
I got you that water.

40:38.837 --> 40:40.317
Thanks, Morgan.

40:42.319 --> 40:44.364
Is that for, um...?

40:44.408 --> 40:45.496
Athena?

40:45.540 --> 40:47.672
Athena.

40:48.978 --> 40:51.459
You keep saying
that name.

40:52.677 --> 40:54.113
What happened
when you were out, Grace,

40:54.157 --> 40:55.941
in that dream
that you had?

40:55.985 --> 40:58.901
What do you think
it was?

41:00.468 --> 41:02.034
I know when people

41:02.078 --> 41:04.776
come as close
to their last moments as I did,

41:04.820 --> 41:07.213
sometimes they see things.

41:07.257 --> 41:09.477
Things they can't explain.

41:10.390 --> 41:11.566
Like a near-death thing?

41:11.609 --> 41:13.785
It felt real.

41:13.829 --> 41:15.700
I really think
it was her.

41:15.744 --> 41:17.223
Hmm.

41:17.267 --> 41:19.356
That's how I know that
everything's gonna be all right.

41:19.399 --> 41:20.749
I've seen --

41:20.792 --> 41:22.446
Ohh!

41:24.622 --> 41:26.058
-You okay?
-Yeah.

41:28.191 --> 41:29.322
You drop the stick,

41:29.366 --> 41:31.411
or I will shoot you dead
right now.

41:31.455 --> 41:34.589
Do it.

41:37.896 --> 41:39.811
I told you I was gonna t
what I came for.

41:39.855 --> 41:41.247
Go.

41:41.291 --> 41:42.553
Though something tells me

41:42.597 --> 41:44.337
this time
you're gonna be less stubborn.

41:44.381 --> 41:45.991
Morgan,
what's he talking about?

41:46.035 --> 41:48.167
That key
around his neck.

41:48.211 --> 41:50.561
Come on,
you know what to do.

41:52.911 --> 41:55.784
Stop, pl--
-Stop.
Morgan --

41:55.827 --> 41:59.570
Just give me the key,
and I will walk away.

41:59.614 --> 42:00.963
What does it open?

42:01.006 --> 42:02.312
Why do you want it?

42:02.355 --> 42:03.574
It doesn't matter.

42:03.618 --> 42:05.620
It's inevitable.

42:05.663 --> 42:07.404
No matter what you do.

42:11.887 --> 42:15.238
"The cost of peace."

42:15.281 --> 42:17.545
That's what she meant.

42:17.588 --> 42:20.548
Morgan,
give him what he wants.

42:20.591 --> 42:23.115
That key
is not the future.

42:23.159 --> 42:24.508
She is.

42:26.597 --> 42:31.254
This baby,
she's gonna create a future

42:31.297 --> 42:33.865
where people like you
will never win.

42:33.909 --> 42:35.824
That is inevitable.

42:35.867 --> 42:37.303
So give him the key.

42:37.347 --> 42:40.698
Because he's already lost.

42:42.091 --> 42:43.962
He just
doesn't know it yet.

42:47.009 --> 42:50.012
Do it!

42:57.846 --> 42:59.674
Good luck.

43:19.084 --> 43:21.609
You okay?

43:24.046 --> 43:26.962
You don't
have to worry, Morgan.

43:27.005 --> 43:29.399
She's gonna bring
everyone together.

43:30.618 --> 43:34.578
She's gonna give everyone
something to fight for.

43:34.622 --> 43:36.058
And I know it.

43:36.101 --> 43:38.713
I know it.

43:38.756 --> 43:42.455
Okay.

43:47.504 --> 43:49.549
I believe she will.

Morgan?

45:54.892 --> 45:57.329
Morgan,
what's wrong?

45:59.288 --> 46:02.247
Why isn't she crying?

46:02.291 --> 46:05.729
Why isn't she crying,
Morgan?

46:05.773 --> 46:07.687
Come on, baby.

46:07.731 --> 46:10.690
Why isn't she crying?

46:10.734 --> 46:12.214
Morgan?

46:12.257 --> 46:13.911
Morgan?!

46:16.871 --> 46:19.482
Morgan...

46:26.532 --> 46:29.405
Let me see her.

46:29.448 --> 46:31.711
I'm sorry.

46:37.630 --> 46:39.981
Oh, baby.

46:41.547 --> 46:45.203
Oh,
my sweet baby girl.

46:45.247 --> 46:48.641
Oh,
you're so beautiful.

46:48.685 --> 46:50.556
Oh, my Athena.

46:50.600 --> 46:52.036
I, uh...

46:53.733 --> 46:56.258
I don't understand.

46:57.737 --> 47:00.305
I don't.

47:00.349 --> 47:02.742
I don't understand.

47:03.961 --> 47:06.572
What I saw...

47:08.531 --> 47:12.709
...they weren't --
they weren't my last moments.

47:14.929 --> 47:17.018
They were hers.

47:29.813 --> 47:32.598
I thought
it was going to be different.

47:35.558 --> 47:38.474
But it was just
a dream.

47:38.517 --> 47:42.304
It was just a dream.
