02:15.344 --> 02:16.345
Quiet.

02:16.511 --> 02:19.014
Open the door, open the door.

02:20.265 --> 02:21.562
What?

02:25.270 --> 02:27.272
What in the devil?

02:27.439 --> 02:29.362
Can you please stand up
and take us to the cash drawer, ma'am?

02:29.524 --> 02:32.619
- I will not.
- We ain't asking.

02:32.778 --> 02:34.405
There's no money in the drawers yet.

02:34.571 --> 02:36.665
It's in the safe and I ain't got the code.

02:36.823 --> 02:38.496
Prove it.

02:38.659 --> 02:40.081
Drawer!

02:40.243 --> 02:41.836
Here.

02:41.995 --> 02:43.338
Open the drawer.

02:43.497 --> 02:45.374
- I need the keys.
- Keys.

02:52.881 --> 02:54.224
Step back.

02:55.592 --> 02:58.095
Shit. Damn it!

02:58.261 --> 03:00.639
Y'all are new at this, I'm guessing.

03:00.806 --> 03:03.275
- Where's the money?
- I told you, it's in the safe.

03:03.433 --> 03:06.186
- Well, who has the code?
- Mr. Clauson.

03:06.353 --> 03:09.448
He'll be here soon
and I suggest you fellers don't be.

03:09.606 --> 03:12.234
All you're guilty of right now
is being stupid.

03:12.401 --> 03:14.403
Just leave and that's all it'll be.

03:18.198 --> 03:19.825
Tell me I'm stupid again.

03:23.954 --> 03:25.922
What time does Mr. Clauson get here?
Ma'am, look at me.

03:26.081 --> 03:28.004
What time does Mr. Clauson get here, huh?

03:28.166 --> 03:29.713
8:30 every morning.

03:32.421 --> 03:33.923
We're walking.

03:36.174 --> 03:38.643
And sit.

03:38.802 --> 03:40.770
Where do you think you're going?
Sit on the floor!

03:57.237 --> 03:58.830
You're stupid.

04:08.957 --> 04:10.129
This ain't about you, darling.

04:17.507 --> 04:18.928
Elsie, you all right?

04:22.554 --> 04:24.101
Good morning.

04:34.691 --> 04:36.318
You didn't have to hit him.

04:43.742 --> 04:45.244
- Slow down.
- I ain't speeding.

04:48.955 --> 04:51.128
See, little brother,
not a worry in the world.

04:52.125 --> 04:54.093
Planning this and doing it
is two different things.

04:55.212 --> 04:58.136
Maybe we should get there ahead,
get up to Olney.

04:59.966 --> 05:02.389
Early bird gets the worm.

05:07.933 --> 05:10.106
- Slow down.
- I ain't speeding.

05:32.249 --> 05:34.297
I found these coins in the barn.

05:34.459 --> 05:36.678
Lord knows how long
they've been sitting there.

05:36.837 --> 05:40.432
I've been living off an inmate's diet,
and had all these coins

05:40.590 --> 05:43.309
sitting right underneath
a bunch of feed sacks.

05:45.470 --> 05:48.724
- This one says 1953.
- 1953?

05:48.890 --> 05:50.858
I wonder if any of these
is collector's items.

05:51.017 --> 05:53.236
You could be sitting on a fortune here.

05:53.395 --> 05:54.647
I hope so.

05:54.813 --> 05:56.531
Good morning, folks. Open the drawer!

05:56.690 --> 05:58.909
Open the motherfucking drawer!

05:59.067 --> 06:01.661
Ones, fives, 10s, 20s,
no hundreds, no bundles.

06:01.820 --> 06:04.118
- You boys robbing the bank?
- Shut up.

06:04.281 --> 06:05.783
Put your hands on the counter.
On the counter.

06:05.949 --> 06:07.872
- Yes, sir.
- That's it, come on.

06:08.034 --> 06:11.163
That's crazy. Y'all ain't even Mexicans.

06:11.329 --> 06:12.876
Uh-uh, uh-uh. No bundles.

06:13.039 --> 06:14.541
Just loose cash.

06:14.708 --> 06:15.880
Okay.

06:16.042 --> 06:17.544
You ought to be ashamed of yourselves.

06:17.711 --> 06:19.088
Hands on the counter where I can see them!

06:19.254 --> 06:20.801
Yes, sir.

06:20.964 --> 06:22.511
You got a gun on you, old man?

06:22.674 --> 06:25.302
You're damn right I got a gun on me.

06:25.468 --> 06:26.640
- Are you gonna get his gun?
- Yeah.

06:26.803 --> 06:28.430
Keep up with the circumstances, okay?

06:28.597 --> 06:31.476
- Yeah, I got it.
- So are y'all gonna steal my gun, too?

06:31.641 --> 06:33.188
I have my own gun.

06:33.351 --> 06:35.524
We ain't stealing from you.
We're stealing from the bank.

06:36.938 --> 06:38.485
Much obliged.

06:40.775 --> 06:42.072
Let's go!

06:42.235 --> 06:43.828
Sorry about this, folks.

06:45.488 --> 06:47.456
Dirty, rotten sons of bitches.

06:50.160 --> 06:51.332
Fuck you, old man!

06:51.494 --> 06:53.121
Go, run, go!

07:10.013 --> 07:12.232
Put the gun on the counter?
You trying to get us killed?

07:12.390 --> 07:13.437
I ain't stealing from some old man.

07:13.600 --> 07:15.648
We're stealing from one place, that's it.

07:15.810 --> 07:17.483
You're turning out to be
a poor-ass criminal.

07:17.646 --> 07:18.898
Oh, fuck you.

07:21.399 --> 07:23.151
Whoo!

07:23.318 --> 07:25.821
See what the early bird gets?

07:27.322 --> 07:28.995
Maybe we should hit that branch in Jayton?

07:29.157 --> 07:32.586
No, we ain't. We hit those banks first thing
in the fucking morning, when they're empty.

07:32.744 --> 07:35.543
- When they're empty, God damn it!
- All right.

07:35.705 --> 07:37.378
It's the last time I care to be shot at.

07:39.250 --> 07:41.469
We got to be smart.
We're a ways from being finished.

07:41.628 --> 07:43.380
Shit, I can do this all week.

07:43.546 --> 07:44.547
We're gonna.

07:44.714 --> 07:49.352
We're like the Comanches,
little brother, raiding wherever we please

07:49.511 --> 07:52.435
with the whole of Texas
hunting our shadow.

07:54.140 --> 07:55.232
Lord of the Plains.

07:58.395 --> 07:59.988
- Hands off.
- Fuck off!

09:40.455 --> 09:42.207
You hear about these bank robberies?

09:45.502 --> 09:47.300
Why are you always dressed like me?

09:49.005 --> 09:50.473
This is our uniform.

09:50.632 --> 09:52.225
We ain't got no uniform.

09:52.383 --> 09:54.306
You can wear whatever
color shirt you choose.

09:54.469 --> 09:56.062
You just keep choosing mine.

09:56.221 --> 09:58.690
Ranger regs say white,
blue, or tan dress shirts.

09:58.848 --> 10:01.977
Stands to reason every once in a while
we're gonna be dressed the same.

10:02.143 --> 10:05.488
Well, you know what they say
about imitation, Alberto.

10:06.773 --> 10:08.320
You wanna hear about these bank robberies,

10:08.483 --> 10:10.451
or you'll just sit there
and let Alzheimer's run its course?

10:10.610 --> 10:12.157
Where are they at?

10:12.320 --> 10:13.742
Texas Midlands...

10:13.905 --> 10:16.499
the branch in Archer City
and the branch in Olney.

10:16.658 --> 10:18.035
FBI want an assist?

10:18.201 --> 10:20.750
Midlands ain't got
any branches outside Texas.

10:20.912 --> 10:23.540
Plus, they're just hitting the drawers
for a few thousand.

10:23.706 --> 10:25.128
FBI don't want it.

10:28.503 --> 10:31.973
You may get to have some fun before they
send you off to the rocking chair yet.

10:52.318 --> 10:54.320
I need you sober.

10:54.487 --> 10:55.955
Who the hell gets drunk off a beer?

11:01.411 --> 11:03.163
Place looks like shit.

11:03.329 --> 11:04.831
You got anything else you wanna say?

11:04.998 --> 11:09.719
There's not a decent steak in the whole
lot of them sorry sons of bitches.

11:09.878 --> 11:11.676
Yeah, well, while you were busy in jail,

11:11.838 --> 11:14.383
I was busy looking after Mama,
so you can go fuck yourself.

11:25.768 --> 11:27.270
Was she in that bed awhile?

11:31.274 --> 11:32.321
Three months.

11:48.333 --> 11:50.051
The end there was pretty rough.

11:53.671 --> 11:55.890
I could've helped out
a little if she asked.

11:57.300 --> 11:59.723
I could've fed them skinny cows.

12:02.430 --> 12:04.603
We had nothing to feed them.

12:04.766 --> 12:07.110
Well, I could've helped clean up
the house a bit.

12:10.480 --> 12:12.858
Never took you for the go-to guy
for house cleaning.

12:13.024 --> 12:16.153
No. Just robbing banks.

12:16.319 --> 12:17.571
You know.

12:31.042 --> 12:32.043
Fuck her.

12:32.210 --> 12:34.304
She never wanted nothing
to do with me anyway.

12:44.639 --> 12:45.765
She leave a will?

12:49.227 --> 12:50.274
Yeah.

12:51.729 --> 12:52.946
Am I in it?

12:59.654 --> 13:00.826
The will don't matter.

13:02.949 --> 13:06.078
She left everything to me.
By Friday it all goes to my boys.

13:09.998 --> 13:11.341
She didn't mean nothing by it.

13:12.667 --> 13:14.340
She damn sure meant it.

13:14.502 --> 13:17.346
She always hated me
for standing up to him.

13:17.505 --> 13:19.223
We all got punished.

13:19.382 --> 13:23.137
You never understood that fighting back
makes the beating last longer.

13:23.303 --> 13:25.305
No, I understood.

13:25.471 --> 13:28.145
That's why I stopped fighting
and shot that son of a bitch.

14:33.664 --> 14:36.793
Hey, what's going on?

14:36.959 --> 14:38.586
Somebody robbed the bank this morning.

14:38.753 --> 14:39.800
Do what?

14:39.962 --> 14:43.345
If you see anyone looking
a little sideways, give me a call.

14:43.508 --> 14:45.181
Sideways don't wanna meet me.

14:45.343 --> 14:47.687
Find itself on the wrong end
of a short rope.

14:47.845 --> 14:51.770
Oh, well, that would simplify things
for everyone but you.

14:51.933 --> 14:55.153
Maybe, if you can find the tree.

14:58.314 --> 15:01.033
God, I love West Texas.

15:04.654 --> 15:06.622
- Ranger.
- Hi there.

15:06.781 --> 15:08.658
Wasn't much of a robbery.

15:08.825 --> 15:10.748
Got off with just under $7,000.

15:10.910 --> 15:14.790
Took the drawer money,
20s and under, only loose bills.

15:14.956 --> 15:16.503
- No ink pack?
- Nope.

15:16.666 --> 15:18.339
- Smart.
- That was smart.

15:18.501 --> 15:20.424
Can we get a look at the video?

15:20.586 --> 15:23.590
Let me introduce you
to the bank manager, Mr. Clauson.

15:26.384 --> 15:28.136
This here is Ranger Hamilton.

15:28.302 --> 15:29.599
- Ranger.
- Sir.

15:29.762 --> 15:32.515
Can we get a look
at the surveillance video?

15:32.682 --> 15:35.902
We got cameras, but they're
switching us over to a digital system

15:36.060 --> 15:37.312
that feeds into the computer.

15:37.478 --> 15:40.152
These new cameras don't hook to our VCRs.

15:40.314 --> 15:42.112
Call over the Young County Sheriffs.

15:42.275 --> 15:46.613
Ask them if they thought to hook their
cameras to some sort of recording device.

15:48.906 --> 15:51.079
- Armed?
- Yes, sir. Pistols.

15:51.242 --> 15:52.368
Oh.

15:53.619 --> 15:54.836
Faces covered?

15:54.996 --> 15:57.875
Ski masks, sweatshirts, baggy pants...

15:58.040 --> 15:59.587
- Uh-huh.
- Like them thugs in Dallas.

15:59.750 --> 16:01.172
Tweakers, maybe?

16:01.335 --> 16:02.427
Maybe.

16:02.587 --> 16:05.431
A little early in the morning
for tweakers.

16:05.590 --> 16:08.560
Tweakers don't sleep. They just tweak.

16:08.718 --> 16:12.143
They rob drug stores
and parked cars, not banks.

16:12.305 --> 16:13.522
Can I take a look inside?

16:13.681 --> 16:14.898
Yes, sir.

16:15.057 --> 16:16.559
Yeah, I'm here, Margaret.

16:16.726 --> 16:18.694
So they bopped you in the snozzola, huh?

16:18.853 --> 16:20.821
Yes, sir.

16:20.980 --> 16:22.277
Not very nice.

16:24.150 --> 16:28.200
I know their faces was covered,
but could you tell their race?

16:28.362 --> 16:30.456
Black, white?

16:30.615 --> 16:33.243
Their skin or their souls?

16:33.409 --> 16:36.504
Let's leave their souls
out of this for now.

16:36.662 --> 16:38.289
White.

16:38.456 --> 16:41.676
From around here somewhere is my guess,

16:41.834 --> 16:43.586
you know, from their voices.

16:43.753 --> 16:45.005
Oh?

16:45.171 --> 16:47.424
Young County says same deal
with the branch in Olney.

16:47.590 --> 16:48.716
Excuse me.

16:50.760 --> 16:51.932
Do they have video?

16:52.094 --> 16:53.516
Same deal all the way around.

16:54.764 --> 16:58.189
Doesn't Walmart sell all sorts
of electronic equipment?

16:58.351 --> 17:00.319
My word. Get your hands off that.

17:01.771 --> 17:06.446
Well, these boys, they aren't done yet,
I'll tell you that.

17:06.608 --> 17:08.361
- How come?
- Well, they're patient.

17:08.528 --> 17:12.249
They're just sticking to the drawers,
not taking the hundreds.

17:12.406 --> 17:14.704
That's the bank's money.
We can trace that.

17:14.867 --> 17:17.244
They're trying to raise a certain amount.

17:17.411 --> 17:18.458
That's my guess.

17:18.621 --> 17:21.545
It's gonna take a few banks to get there.

17:34.887 --> 17:36.480
Your boys know how rich they're gonna be?

17:39.517 --> 17:40.939
They don't know anything yet.

17:43.020 --> 17:44.488
You take them to the funeral?

17:47.108 --> 17:48.951
Like I said, they don't know anything.

17:52.738 --> 17:54.331
When's the last time you saw them?

17:58.911 --> 18:01.585
When we all went to the rodeo
in Stamford right after you got out.

18:04.083 --> 18:06.962
- That was a year ago.
- I talk to them on the phone.

18:07.128 --> 18:08.721
You talk to them on the phone?

18:12.174 --> 18:14.927
- You want a little advice?
- No. No, I don't.

18:15.094 --> 18:16.220
Go see them tomorrow.

18:20.057 --> 18:22.981
You got any idea how much
I owe Debbie in child support?

18:23.144 --> 18:25.863
You've got enough in your front pocket
to fix that problem right now.

18:28.274 --> 18:29.901
We can't spare it, you know that.

18:31.360 --> 18:33.112
Maybe we should hit another branch.

18:37.783 --> 18:41.128
You know, you talk like
we ain't gonna get away with this.

18:41.287 --> 18:45.087
I've never met nobody who got away
with anything, ever.

18:45.249 --> 18:46.501
You?

18:50.504 --> 18:52.381
Then why in the hell
did you agree to do it?

18:54.008 --> 18:55.510
Because you asked, little brother.

19:03.476 --> 19:05.194
I got to shit like an old goat.

19:06.604 --> 19:08.231
Grab the check, meet me out front.

19:15.988 --> 19:18.707
Well, if that isn't a hint,
I don't know what is.

19:23.329 --> 19:25.878
- You like your steak?
- Yes, ma'am.

19:26.040 --> 19:27.963
Well, you've got a ways to go yet.

19:29.168 --> 19:32.468
Yeah, you'll be waiting around all day
for me to finish this.

19:32.630 --> 19:36.180
I'll be here whether
you finish it or not, so...

19:36.342 --> 19:37.719
you take your time.

19:46.268 --> 19:47.565
Sure is quiet in here.

19:48.646 --> 19:51.399
Open the drawer. Fives, 10s, 20s.

19:51.565 --> 19:53.283
Fan them out like a deck of cards.

19:54.819 --> 19:56.287
What do you do?

20:01.200 --> 20:03.703
Last job was for a...

20:03.869 --> 20:05.746
natural gas company.

20:07.206 --> 20:08.298
Sounds high-dollar.

20:09.709 --> 20:12.553
No, there ain't nothing
high-dollar about drilling.

20:12.712 --> 20:14.840
No one seems to be
drilling for gas now, anyway.

20:15.005 --> 20:17.383
They're sure drilling for oil.

20:17.550 --> 20:19.598
I mean, ain't one drill
the same as the next?

20:22.096 --> 20:23.598
That's my take on it.

20:24.724 --> 20:26.442
Guess I got to get
someone else to believe me.

20:26.600 --> 20:28.477
Son of a bitch!

20:30.312 --> 20:31.859
We could use a cook.

20:37.319 --> 20:38.491
Just a thought.

20:39.822 --> 20:41.620
Order's up, Jenny Ann.

20:47.455 --> 20:48.502
Bye.

21:10.186 --> 21:11.813
Start the car!

21:11.979 --> 21:13.151
Shit!

21:18.694 --> 21:20.446
Fuck! Shit!

21:20.613 --> 21:21.910
Go, go, go!

21:39.340 --> 21:41.889
I bet you don't owe this much
in child support.

21:42.927 --> 21:44.804
I must be out of my goddamn mind
to ask you for help.

21:46.722 --> 21:49.566
You wanna get us killed? Huh?

21:49.725 --> 21:52.604
That's not a Midlands Branch.
That's not part of the plan.

21:52.770 --> 21:54.613
Now, we got to go back
to the ranch and bury the car.

21:54.772 --> 21:55.944
- Fuck!
- No, we do not.

21:56.106 --> 21:57.449
We're over halfway to Oklahoma.

21:57.608 --> 22:01.704
I'm not driving a stolen getaway car
to a fucking Indian casino.

22:01.862 --> 22:03.239
You just put us a goddamn day behind.

22:03.405 --> 22:06.329
Well, I got us a day ahead
this morning, so I guess we're even.

22:06.492 --> 22:08.119
- You're welcome.
- Fuck you.

22:17.920 --> 22:19.513
Can't you answer your own phone?

22:19.672 --> 22:22.801
I'm driving. You're just sitting there
twiddling your fat fingers.

22:24.468 --> 22:26.061
Ranger Hamilton's phone.

23:09.305 --> 23:10.898
It's reckless is what it is.

23:11.056 --> 23:12.148
It's tweakers, I'm telling you.

23:12.308 --> 23:13.981
I don't think these boys is reckless.

23:14.143 --> 23:16.237
Damn sure ain't tweakers.

23:16.395 --> 23:18.397
They know exactly what they're doing.

23:19.940 --> 23:23.410
I don't know how you're gonna survive
without somebody to outsmart.

23:24.653 --> 23:26.826
You need a hobby, and quick.

23:27.865 --> 23:29.037
How about a horse?

23:30.451 --> 23:32.545
Mary Beth was the rider.

23:34.204 --> 23:36.206
A horse would only remind me of her.

23:38.334 --> 23:39.506
You like to fish.

23:41.754 --> 23:44.223
Not enough to do it every goddamn day.

23:45.633 --> 23:47.476
Yeah, when I retire,

23:47.635 --> 23:50.684
I'm gonna move Esme and me
down to Galveston.

23:50.846 --> 23:52.143
Buy a fishing boat.

23:52.306 --> 23:54.980
Gonna live on that son of a bitch
right at the pier.

23:55.142 --> 23:57.861
Oh, who knows?

23:58.020 --> 24:01.490
Maybe one of these bank robbers
is gonna want a gunfight

24:01.649 --> 24:05.495
and I can dodge my retirement
in a blaze of glory.

24:05.653 --> 24:07.530
Well, I've seen you shoot.

24:07.696 --> 24:09.289
There won't be much glory in it.

24:11.241 --> 24:13.243
Oh, well, I'm lucky

24:13.410 --> 24:16.414
I got a half-breed by my side
to avenge me.

24:17.581 --> 24:20.300
If you can stay sober long enough,

24:20.459 --> 24:23.212
knowing how you Injuns like the bottle.

24:30.427 --> 24:32.225
Whoa.

24:40.562 --> 24:42.360
Hey!

24:42.523 --> 24:44.525
What you all doing?
You burning this field?

24:44.692 --> 24:46.114
Why in the shit would we do that?

24:46.276 --> 24:48.870
This kicked up on the highway,
been chasing us ever since.

24:49.029 --> 24:51.157
Wish we could do something for you.

24:51.323 --> 24:53.371
Ought to just let it turn me to ashes,
put me out of my misery.

24:53.534 --> 24:55.332
Cut that fence.

24:55.494 --> 24:59.089
21st century, I'm racing a fire
to the river with a herd of cattle.

24:59.248 --> 25:01.967
And I wonder why my kids
won't do this shit for a living.

25:02.126 --> 25:04.094
Move 'em out. Come on.

25:04.253 --> 25:05.630
Go, go, go.

25:08.632 --> 25:10.600
You wanna call it in?

25:10.759 --> 25:13.433
Oh, it's gonna burn out
when it hits the Brazos.

25:14.722 --> 25:17.646
No one to call around here, anyway.

25:17.808 --> 25:19.936
No, these boys is on their own.

25:29.361 --> 25:30.453
I still don't see the problem, Toby.

25:30.612 --> 25:31.613
You still don't...

25:31.780 --> 25:34.791
Rhe problem is, thanks to you, we have to
spend tomorrow morning getting another car,

25:34.950 --> 25:36.748
so we'll have to hit two banks
on Wednesday.

25:36.910 --> 25:38.878
We already done three today.

25:39.038 --> 25:40.585
Stop worrying.

25:43.709 --> 25:44.835
Whose land is this?

25:47.421 --> 25:48.764
Jeremy Chalker.

25:50.340 --> 25:52.763
He lets me stay here in exchange
for shooting coyotes.

25:58.265 --> 25:59.517
Cold beer in the fridge.

26:17.701 --> 26:18.748
You stole my hat.

26:18.911 --> 26:20.128
I borrowed it.

26:20.287 --> 26:21.630
What the fuck you do to it?

26:35.761 --> 26:37.809
- What's this?
- My livelihood.

26:39.598 --> 26:40.815
We don't need all this.

26:40.974 --> 26:43.602
Can't keep the guns
in the trailer days on end.

26:43.769 --> 26:45.191
That's not coming with us in the bank.

26:49.358 --> 26:50.655
Just spoke to the teller.

26:50.818 --> 26:51.990
She's a little shook up.

26:52.152 --> 26:55.285
Perp took her driver's license,
threatened her family if she talked to us.

26:57.741 --> 27:00.335
Mind if I ask you your name, young lady?

27:00.494 --> 27:02.246
Natalie Martinez.

27:02.412 --> 27:04.835
Well, Natalie, I want you to know

27:04.998 --> 27:07.968
we're gonna have some officers
watching your house extra careful

27:08.127 --> 27:09.379
till we catch these buggers.

27:09.545 --> 27:11.718
You have my word on that.

27:11.880 --> 27:13.223
There's more than one?

27:14.299 --> 27:16.427
Only one man robbed the bank?

27:16.593 --> 27:18.391
- Yeah.
- What'd he look like?

27:18.554 --> 27:22.809
He was dressed like a cowpoke
except for the ski mask.

27:23.976 --> 27:27.947
I think he ran to a car
that was parked out front of the diner.

27:28.105 --> 27:29.948
You saw the car?

27:30.107 --> 27:32.075
It was green.

27:32.234 --> 27:34.737
- How old?
- I don't know cars, mister.

27:34.903 --> 27:38.624
Well, was it a nice car, an okay car,

27:38.782 --> 27:40.079
or a real piece of shit?

27:41.660 --> 27:42.957
It was a real piece of shit.

27:43.120 --> 27:45.418
All right. Now, we're getting somewhere.

27:46.790 --> 27:49.669
Oh, that looks like a man
who could foreclose on a house.

27:49.835 --> 27:51.257
Excuse me, Natalie.

27:51.420 --> 27:53.013
Excuse me, Mr. Banker.

27:53.172 --> 27:55.721
Natalie, I'm gonna have the officer
stay with you till your father arrives.

27:55.883 --> 27:57.009
- All right?
- Okay.

27:57.176 --> 27:59.895
Didn't happen to have your surveillance
cameras on this morning, did you?

28:00.053 --> 28:01.145
Of course.

28:01.305 --> 28:03.228
Oh, so you have the robbery on video.

28:03.390 --> 28:04.437
Of course we do.

28:04.600 --> 28:07.319
What kind of bank would we be
if we didn't have video surveillance?

28:07.477 --> 28:10.572
Oh, you'd be a Texas Midlands Bank.

28:10.731 --> 28:12.529
All right, we've got video.

28:12.691 --> 28:15.820
Care to give it a watch
while I wander over to the burger joint?

28:15.986 --> 28:17.363
Would you order me something
while you're there?

28:17.529 --> 28:20.408
- I'm starving.
- I doubt they serve pemmican.

28:20.574 --> 28:22.497
You know I'm part Mexican, too.

28:22.659 --> 28:26.956
Yeah, well, I'm gonna get to that
when I'm through with the Indian insults,

28:27.122 --> 28:28.624
but it's gonna be a while.

28:31.043 --> 28:33.216
You rangers are an odd bunch.

28:33.378 --> 28:36.257
No, just him.

28:36.423 --> 28:37.675
Let's take a look at that video.

28:37.841 --> 28:39.639
Yeah, it's right back here.

28:49.895 --> 28:51.363
Howdy.

28:51.521 --> 28:52.738
Ma'am.

28:52.898 --> 28:55.447
Guess you know about
the goings-on at the bank.

28:55.609 --> 28:56.701
I did notice.

28:56.860 --> 28:59.113
Any out-of-towners come through today?

29:00.113 --> 29:03.538
Jenny Ann waited on a couple of boys,
ain't from here.

29:03.700 --> 29:04.747
Oh?

29:04.910 --> 29:06.503
I'll go get her.

29:06.662 --> 29:08.005
Appreciate that.

29:12.000 --> 29:13.752
Boys.

29:13.919 --> 29:15.842
Y'all been here for a while?

29:16.004 --> 29:17.927
Well, long enough to watch
a bank getting robbed

29:18.090 --> 29:21.139
that's been robbing me for 30 years.

29:21.301 --> 29:22.723
Oh, you say you've seen them?

29:24.221 --> 29:28.021
I'm pretty sure they were sitting
right over there having lunch.

29:28.183 --> 29:29.856
One of them was tall.

29:30.018 --> 29:32.487
The other one was short.

29:34.106 --> 29:36.234
They's both lean like cowboys.

29:36.400 --> 29:38.903
Looked like brothers if you ask me.

29:39.069 --> 29:40.992
You the Texas Ranger?

29:41.154 --> 29:43.031
Yes, ma'am.

29:43.198 --> 29:46.577
Tell me about those handsome
young strangers that you waited on.

29:48.328 --> 29:49.921
Who said handsome?

29:50.080 --> 29:51.252
I did.

29:52.332 --> 29:54.926
Based on the fact that you didn't
meet me in the parking lot,

29:55.085 --> 29:59.051
hollering about the two out-of-towners
eating here right before a bank robbery.

30:01.883 --> 30:03.635
Well, they didn't mention
they was robbing the bank.

30:03.802 --> 30:05.019
They paid cash?

30:06.263 --> 30:07.606
That a crime now?

30:10.976 --> 30:12.193
How much did they leave?

30:15.772 --> 30:16.819
How much?

30:17.983 --> 30:19.576
$200.

30:19.735 --> 30:23.456
And they left it before
the bank was robbed, so...

30:23.613 --> 30:26.036
Uh, before this bank was robbed.

30:27.659 --> 30:29.332
I'm gonna need to see them bills.

30:33.623 --> 30:35.375
- Ma'am.
- Mm-mm.

30:36.668 --> 30:39.262
Ma'am, them bills is evidence.

30:39.421 --> 30:41.799
Mm-mm, it's evidence
if they're the bank robbers.

30:41.965 --> 30:44.889
Till then, it's my tip.

30:45.052 --> 30:47.100
And half my mortgage.

30:47.262 --> 30:49.931
So, you go out there and you get
a warrant, and you come after the money

30:50.098 --> 30:52.977
that I will be using to keep a roof
over my daughter's head.

30:57.272 --> 31:00.572
One man hit the bank, just like she said.

31:00.734 --> 31:02.327
- Yeah.
- Checkered button-down shirt,

31:02.486 --> 31:03.863
jeans, ski mask.

31:04.029 --> 31:05.246
- That's all the video will tell us.
- Yep. Yep.

31:05.405 --> 31:08.284
Checkered shirt. That is him.

31:08.450 --> 31:12.205
They were sitting right over there.
Tipped her $200.

31:13.830 --> 31:16.629
Go wrestle a description

31:16.792 --> 31:19.170
from that big sassy girl in the kitchen.

31:19.336 --> 31:20.428
You didn't get it yourself?

31:20.587 --> 31:24.182
Oh, and get that tip from her.
We're gonna check them bills.

31:24.341 --> 31:25.558
Good luck.

31:25.717 --> 31:28.516
Yeah, I'd expect some resistance.

31:28.678 --> 31:30.851
Oh, and, Alberto,

31:31.014 --> 31:35.394
call that motel on 287, get us a room.

31:35.560 --> 31:36.607
We're gonna stay the night?

31:36.770 --> 31:38.317
Well, this is where the action is.

31:40.232 --> 31:41.575
Seems foolish.

31:41.733 --> 31:43.155
What's that?

31:43.318 --> 31:46.822
The days of robbing banks
and trying to live to spend the money...

31:48.407 --> 31:49.659
they're long gone.

31:50.659 --> 31:52.206
Long gone for sure.

32:01.044 --> 32:02.842
What does Justin want to do
when he's grown?

32:05.382 --> 32:07.976
Right now he's dreaming
of slinging a football for A&M.

32:13.640 --> 32:14.892
He's a lot like you.

32:15.058 --> 32:18.562
- I bet that puckers your red eye.
- More than you know.

32:21.064 --> 32:24.238
39 years of life, 10 in jail.

32:24.401 --> 32:27.450
If he turn left where I turned right,
he'll be okay.

32:34.536 --> 32:38.006
Let the world call me a fool

32:39.416 --> 32:42.716
Things are right with me and you

32:44.463 --> 32:45.464
Yaw.

32:47.591 --> 32:49.514
Yaw.

33:04.566 --> 33:05.783
You want anything?

33:05.942 --> 33:07.615
Dr Pepper, Winston Lights.

33:11.740 --> 33:13.868
It's okay. Come on.

33:25.921 --> 33:27.013
What?

33:29.174 --> 33:30.221
What, bitch?

33:32.594 --> 33:35.063
You looking for trouble, motherfucker?

33:35.222 --> 33:37.145
You came to the right place.

33:37.307 --> 33:40.186
Boy, you'd think there were 10 of me.

33:41.561 --> 33:42.608
Oh, yeah?

33:45.607 --> 33:48.281
Not so fucking tough now, are you, bitch?

34:03.291 --> 34:04.417
Hey, man, he had it coming.

34:04.584 --> 34:06.086
He had it coming. He had it coming.

34:12.092 --> 34:15.096
You got some spunk left in you.

34:16.513 --> 34:18.641
Oh, you remembered the gun.

34:18.806 --> 34:21.275
You're getting to be old hat at this.

34:30.485 --> 34:32.487
Asshole could've killed you.

34:32.654 --> 34:35.157
Ah, not the way
it would have gone, little brother.

34:39.119 --> 34:42.043
10 of me, I told you!

34:43.956 --> 34:45.004
Are you trying to make me mad?

34:45.166 --> 34:47.089
I said Dr Pepper. This is Mr. Pibb.

34:47.252 --> 34:48.253
That's all they had.

34:48.420 --> 34:50.342
Only assholes drink Mr. Pibb.

34:50.505 --> 34:51.677
Drink up.

35:02.934 --> 35:03.981
Hello.

35:20.493 --> 35:21.710
No!

35:25.206 --> 35:26.332
Now we're talking.

35:28.501 --> 35:30.094
The women in this place.

35:32.631 --> 35:34.679
What the hell you talking about?

35:34.841 --> 35:36.764
We should get another shot.
They'll be pretty soon enough.

35:36.926 --> 35:39.395
Bartender, whiskeys if you please.

35:39.554 --> 35:40.680
Coming up.

35:45.226 --> 35:46.273
To your boys.

35:57.781 --> 35:59.033
Let's go change that money.

36:05.163 --> 36:07.257
Sorry. I just sold my car.

36:07.415 --> 36:08.667
This is how the fella paid me.

36:08.833 --> 36:10.551
We take it any way you bring it, mister.

36:23.556 --> 36:25.433
Wanna play some poker?

36:25.600 --> 36:26.601
I don't gamble.

36:26.768 --> 36:28.520
You can't lose at poker, not even you.

36:29.813 --> 36:31.941
I'm gonna watch the Aggie game
and have a beer.

36:32.107 --> 36:33.450
All right, suit yourself.

36:35.110 --> 36:36.487
Come on, now.

36:36.653 --> 36:38.200
Suck a D.

36:38.363 --> 36:39.706
Don't lose it all.

36:39.864 --> 36:41.787
Eat my A!

36:41.950 --> 36:43.668
Fucking asshole.

37:40.550 --> 37:43.474
That's, uh... that's quite a stack.

37:53.813 --> 37:54.985
Check?

37:55.148 --> 37:56.491
Don't chase me, chief.

38:09.913 --> 38:10.914
You Comanche?

38:14.959 --> 38:16.552
Lords of the Plains.

38:17.545 --> 38:19.138
Lords of Nothing now.

38:28.181 --> 38:29.398
I call.

38:31.851 --> 38:33.398
Show your cards, gentlemen.

38:46.491 --> 38:48.414
Do you know what Comanche means?

38:51.162 --> 38:53.540
It means enemies forever.

38:53.706 --> 38:55.333
Enemies with who?

38:55.500 --> 38:57.377
Everyone.

38:57.544 --> 38:59.296
You know what that makes me?

38:59.462 --> 39:00.463
An enemy.

39:00.630 --> 39:02.507
No.

39:02.674 --> 39:04.768
It makes me a Comanche.

39:14.394 --> 39:15.771
Does he look like you?

39:16.771 --> 39:17.988
I see his mom in him.

39:19.190 --> 39:20.783
Everybody else sees me.

39:22.235 --> 39:23.282
I don't know.

39:28.449 --> 39:30.122
You staying in the hotel?

39:34.247 --> 39:35.294
Yeah.

39:37.458 --> 39:40.883
Take me to your room.

39:45.842 --> 39:47.185
Thank you. Just, uh...

39:48.261 --> 39:51.856
There's no shame
in needing the touch of a woman.

39:54.851 --> 39:56.398
You need it.

39:57.478 --> 39:58.821
I know you do.

40:00.481 --> 40:02.700
Just let me touch you.

40:03.693 --> 40:05.695
Trying to work my little brother?

40:05.862 --> 40:07.660
- No, I wasn't doing anything, but I...
- Tanner, she didn't do nothin'.

40:07.822 --> 40:09.540
- She didn't do nothin'.
- But, but, but...

40:09.699 --> 40:11.497
You saw there was a stack of chips here.

40:11.659 --> 40:12.706
- Don't.
- Easy mark?

40:12.869 --> 40:14.746
- Uh... no.
- What were you gonna do?

40:14.913 --> 40:16.881
Bring him up to his room, call your pimp,

40:17.040 --> 40:18.087
- roll him, drug him, what?
- No. I...

40:18.249 --> 40:19.751
- What were you gonna do?
- Tanner, no.

40:19.918 --> 40:21.761
Mind if I sample the goods?
Real fuckin'...

40:21.920 --> 40:25.925
Hands off. Stop it. Stop it.

40:31.554 --> 40:33.352
- You're fucking crazy!
- Call me.

40:33.514 --> 40:34.515
We got a problem here?

40:34.682 --> 40:36.309
- It's all good.
- It's all good.

40:36.476 --> 40:38.604
It's all good.
Just got a little drunk at the bar.

40:38.770 --> 40:39.942
Sorry about that.

40:43.399 --> 40:46.369
How the fuck have you managed
to stay out of prison for a year?

40:46.527 --> 40:47.779
It's been difficult.

40:52.659 --> 40:54.787
Like to pay this out in cash or check?

40:54.953 --> 40:56.421
Get some Debbie money.

40:57.580 --> 41:00.129
Four in cash, rest in check.

41:01.668 --> 41:03.261
Who would you like the check made out to?

41:05.338 --> 41:06.840
Texas Midlands Bank.

41:15.473 --> 41:16.565
Thank you much.

41:17.809 --> 41:19.311
Let's go get a room.

41:30.613 --> 41:33.162
Welcome to the Comanche 66.
Do you have a reservation?

41:33.324 --> 41:34.917
We do not.

41:35.076 --> 41:38.455
Good Lord, look at you.

41:39.580 --> 41:41.958
We would be obliged if you
would provide accommodations,

41:42.125 --> 41:44.219
though we failed to call ahead.

41:44.377 --> 41:46.379
Boy, you are trouble.

41:46.546 --> 41:47.718
I'm the worst kind, darling.

41:47.880 --> 41:52.761
In your last days in the nursing home,
you'll think of me and giggle.

41:57.890 --> 42:00.564
Why, God? Why won't you answer my prayers?

42:00.727 --> 42:02.195
You begged him for help,

42:02.353 --> 42:04.776
and yet you look around at your life
and nothing is different.

42:04.939 --> 42:08.193
And so you assume
that God has told you no.

42:09.569 --> 42:12.163
God doesn't say no.

42:12.321 --> 42:14.540
Why couldn't we drive back to Lubbock?

42:14.699 --> 42:16.872
'Cause they ain't robbing banks
in Lubbock.

42:17.869 --> 42:19.712
We're not gonna watch this, are we?

42:21.831 --> 42:23.583
Ain't you Christian?

42:23.750 --> 42:25.297
Yeah, but I ain't stupid.

42:25.460 --> 42:28.509
God doesn't talk through this man
any more than he talks through my dog.

42:28.671 --> 42:31.390
Well, then maybe you should
give your dog a listen.

42:31.549 --> 42:32.641
Ain't you Indian?

42:32.800 --> 42:34.802
You're supposed to be burning sage

42:34.969 --> 42:39.440
and dancing around the bed,
whooping like a bee stung you.

42:39.599 --> 42:41.567
I'm Catholic.

42:43.686 --> 42:44.687
Come on.

42:46.647 --> 42:50.322
Come on, I'd rather dance
around the fire with a spear.

42:50.485 --> 42:53.329
I'd rather have you stab me
with a spear than watch this.

42:53.488 --> 42:55.490
This son of a bitch, he wouldn't know God

42:55.656 --> 42:58.626
if he crawled up his pant leg
and bit him on the pecker.

42:58.785 --> 43:00.128
Change the damn channel.

43:08.211 --> 43:10.839
Now, this, this is
what God watches right here.

43:14.926 --> 43:17.896
Don't worry, they're gonna have
soccer highlights on soon enough.

43:18.054 --> 43:19.727
That's for your Mexican half.

43:25.478 --> 43:27.401
Wow, look at this boy run.

43:28.397 --> 43:30.525
Longhorns are gonna have
a good team this year.

43:34.821 --> 43:37.950
That soccer, never could understand that.

43:38.116 --> 43:41.336
Anything a 5-year-old can do
ain't a sport.

43:41.494 --> 43:44.919
Who invented it? Aztecs?

43:45.081 --> 43:47.379
Kickin' around skulls or something, right?

43:48.876 --> 43:51.004
Sounds like a Comanche sport.

43:52.505 --> 43:54.257
You know, in three weeks,

43:54.423 --> 43:57.677
you can watch whatever
you want on TV all day.

43:57.844 --> 44:00.267
Hell, you can do it right now
in your own room.

44:00.429 --> 44:02.523
Oh, where's the fun in that?

44:03.516 --> 44:05.518
You know what, Alberto?

44:06.644 --> 44:07.691
What?

44:09.147 --> 44:14.452
In a year's time,
it's my teasing that you're gonna miss.

44:16.154 --> 44:17.451
It's what you'll laugh about

44:17.613 --> 44:20.617
when you stand over my grave
and wish me well.

44:20.783 --> 44:22.535
God, I hope that's tomorrow.

44:23.578 --> 44:24.955
Oh, that was a good one.

44:27.665 --> 44:30.134
You'll get the hang of this yet.

44:36.549 --> 44:37.926
Isn't it getting late for you?

44:42.930 --> 44:43.931
Yeah.

44:48.853 --> 44:50.150
Yeah, it is.

45:07.205 --> 45:08.331
Oh, heavens above.

45:08.497 --> 45:10.670
Heavens above.

45:10.833 --> 45:12.835
Look at those titties.
Are you fucking kidding me?

45:58.172 --> 45:59.219
What are you doing?

46:02.677 --> 46:05.601
Sleeping on the porch,
practicing my future.

46:11.519 --> 46:13.613
It's a dangerous thing we do for a living.

46:15.189 --> 46:16.315
You're lucky...

46:17.858 --> 46:19.906
having seen it through to the end.

46:20.987 --> 46:22.455
I hope I'm that lucky.

46:24.907 --> 46:26.159
Oh, well.

46:27.535 --> 46:30.163
Without me by your side,
I doubt you'll get close enough

46:30.329 --> 46:32.878
to a criminal to ever be in danger again.

46:37.670 --> 46:39.923
Just when I was starting
to feel sorry for you.

46:42.008 --> 46:44.761
Indians ain't supposed
to feel sorry for cowboys.

46:44.927 --> 46:46.554
It's the other way around.

46:55.146 --> 46:56.864
And this makes you the executor?

46:57.023 --> 46:58.570
Mm-hmm.

46:58.733 --> 47:01.486
So, no matter what they charge us with,
they can't take it away?

47:01.652 --> 47:04.201
There's no way to trace funds
from a casino, all right?

47:04.363 --> 47:07.742
Once you get the checks to the bank,
trust is untouchable.

47:07.908 --> 47:11.629
You can't tell nobody nothing, right?

47:11.787 --> 47:13.004
Well, what is there to tell?

47:13.164 --> 47:16.043
I mean, you boys won
that money gambling, didn't you?

47:18.669 --> 47:21.718
$32,000 pays off the reverse mortgage.

47:21.881 --> 47:25.351
And those bastards paid
the property tax from 2012 to now.

47:25.509 --> 47:27.557
That's another $11,000.

47:27.720 --> 47:30.690
So, $43,000 and you are free and clear.

47:31.766 --> 47:35.487
Just have the loan officer
fax me a release of lien,

47:35.644 --> 47:38.193
and I'll get that over
to the lease manager at Chevron.

47:38.356 --> 47:40.358
- The fax number is on the card.
- Okay.

47:40.524 --> 47:42.197
How much you making on this deal?

47:43.319 --> 47:45.742
Not near as much as I'm risking.

47:45.905 --> 47:47.031
Why you doin' it, then?

47:52.787 --> 47:55.256
You know, they loaned
the least they could.

47:55.414 --> 47:58.588
Just enough to keep your mama poor
on a guaranteed return.

47:59.835 --> 48:03.339
Thought they could swipe
her land for $25,000.

48:04.507 --> 48:07.010
That's just so arrogant,
it makes my teeth hurt.

48:10.096 --> 48:11.393
To see you boys...

48:12.390 --> 48:14.859
pay those bastards back
with their own money?

48:17.770 --> 48:19.818
Well, if that ain't Texan,
I don't know what is.

48:25.277 --> 48:26.449
Thank you.

48:26.612 --> 48:28.489
Now, they can foreclose on Friday.

48:28.656 --> 48:31.454
Come hell or high water,
be at the bank in Childress on Thursday.

48:31.617 --> 48:33.039
Knowing them fuckers,
they will close early.

48:33.202 --> 48:35.796
- We'll be there.
- Oh, and, Toby.

48:35.955 --> 48:38.083
The trust needs to be managed by a bank.

48:38.249 --> 48:40.251
You really wanna cover your tracks?

48:41.335 --> 48:43.963
You get Texas Midland
to handle this trust.

49:02.523 --> 49:06.118
So, what's the plan?

49:06.277 --> 49:09.531
We're gonna watch that bank
like a deer feeder.

49:09.697 --> 49:11.950
In time, we'll be right.

49:12.116 --> 49:14.665
Now, let's see what they got to eat here.

49:15.911 --> 49:18.084
Howdy, ma'am. How you doing today?

49:18.247 --> 49:21.000
Hot, and I don't mean the good kind.

49:22.001 --> 49:24.003
So, what don't you want?

49:24.170 --> 49:25.797
Pardon?

49:25.963 --> 49:27.556
What don't you want?

49:29.091 --> 49:32.516
Oh, well, uh, I think I'll just, uh...

49:32.678 --> 49:35.807
You know, I've been working here
for 44 years.

49:35.973 --> 49:40.853
Ain't nobody ever ordered nothing
but T-bone steak and a baked potato.

49:41.020 --> 49:43.523
Except this one asshole from New York

49:43.689 --> 49:46.784
tried to order trout back in 1987.

49:46.942 --> 49:49.365
We don't sell no goddamned trout.

49:50.362 --> 49:52.865
T-bone steaks.

49:53.032 --> 49:56.878
So, either you don't want
the corn on the cob,

49:57.036 --> 49:59.414
or you don't want the green beans.

49:59.580 --> 50:01.048
So, what don't you want?

50:05.211 --> 50:06.713
I don't want green beans.

50:06.879 --> 50:08.677
I don't want green beans either.

50:08.839 --> 50:10.933
Steaks cooked medium rare.

50:11.091 --> 50:14.391
- Can I get my steak cooked...
- That weren't no question.

50:14.553 --> 50:15.600
All right.

50:16.597 --> 50:18.645
Iced tea for you boys.

50:18.807 --> 50:20.059
Iced tea would be great.

50:21.352 --> 50:23.320
Iced tea, yep. Thank you, ma'am.

50:23.479 --> 50:24.696
Uh-huh.

50:28.359 --> 50:29.986
Well, I'll tell you one thing.

50:31.237 --> 50:33.205
Nobody's gonna rob this son of a bitch.

50:34.865 --> 50:35.957
My word.

50:44.625 --> 50:45.751
How's she feel?

50:46.919 --> 50:48.592
She runs good.

50:48.754 --> 50:50.848
Ain't gonna win any races.

50:51.006 --> 50:52.553
Got New Mexico plates.

50:54.218 --> 50:55.470
She got a top?

50:55.636 --> 50:56.762
How she came.

50:58.681 --> 51:00.354
We'll take her.

51:02.935 --> 51:04.653
Don't report it stolen till Friday.

51:11.902 --> 51:13.825
The guy from Chevron
is dropping off the lease agreement.

51:13.988 --> 51:15.865
Are you okay dealing with that
by yourself?

51:16.031 --> 51:17.658
You okay being with Debbie by yourself?

51:18.784 --> 51:19.910
Remember, he ain't the enemy.

51:20.077 --> 51:22.796
Just take the papers, say thank you.

51:23.831 --> 51:25.959
The oil man is the enemy, make no mistake.

51:26.125 --> 51:27.377
He just ain't ours.

51:29.628 --> 51:30.880
I'll be back to the ranch by dark.

51:31.046 --> 51:32.047
I will be waiting.

51:32.214 --> 51:34.433
Drive like a schoolteacher
with all this shit in the back.

51:38.262 --> 51:40.731
Sure feels like beer o'clock.

51:42.016 --> 51:44.986
Ask and you shall receive.

52:14.298 --> 52:15.345
Come in.

52:26.268 --> 52:27.736
Mama died.

52:27.895 --> 52:29.568
When?

52:29.730 --> 52:30.902
A few weeks ago.

52:32.566 --> 52:33.863
Well, good riddance.

52:35.194 --> 52:36.320
No offense.

52:38.906 --> 52:39.953
You okay?

52:41.659 --> 52:42.751
You?

52:46.705 --> 52:47.922
Here's the money I owe you.

52:50.709 --> 52:53.303
I guess you'll be selling the ranch.

52:54.296 --> 52:55.548
It goes to the boys.

52:55.714 --> 52:56.715
- Really?
- Mmm.

52:56.882 --> 52:58.384
It's been put in a trust.

52:58.550 --> 52:59.722
What's that mean?

52:59.885 --> 53:01.182
It means no one can sell it.

53:02.721 --> 53:04.098
Great.

53:04.264 --> 53:06.358
Something else I got to take care of.

53:19.321 --> 53:20.447
Hi.

53:58.068 --> 53:59.194
Where's your brother?

54:01.238 --> 54:02.330
I don't know.

54:03.407 --> 54:04.750
Friend's house, I guess.

54:11.248 --> 54:12.591
How come you ain't in school?

54:13.667 --> 54:15.510
School don't start yet.

54:15.669 --> 54:18.388
Just two-a-days for football right now.

54:24.595 --> 54:26.097
Your grandmother died.

54:28.724 --> 54:30.772
I'm giving the ranch
to you and your brother.

54:32.853 --> 54:34.651
Remember going out there
when you was little?

54:36.774 --> 54:38.617
What am I supposed to do with a ranch?

54:40.110 --> 54:41.282
Anything but sell it.

54:43.947 --> 54:45.324
We found oil on it.

54:47.910 --> 54:50.629
You and your brother ain't gonna
have to worry about money no more.

54:53.373 --> 54:54.374
Now...

54:56.043 --> 54:58.842
you may be hearing
a lot of things about me and...

54:59.963 --> 55:01.089
your uncle.

55:04.092 --> 55:05.469
Don't be like us.

55:05.636 --> 55:06.762
You hear me?

55:08.305 --> 55:10.649
Whatever I hear, I won't believe.

55:10.808 --> 55:12.025
No, you believe it.

55:13.519 --> 55:14.771
I did all of it.

55:17.314 --> 55:19.066
Now, you, you do it different.

55:29.910 --> 55:31.036
Ain't gonna drink it?

55:34.414 --> 55:37.634
You tell me not to be like you,
and then you offer me a beer.

55:37.793 --> 55:38.885
Which is it?

55:41.922 --> 55:43.014
Good boy.

56:03.944 --> 56:06.288
- How are the boys?
- What are you doin'?

56:06.446 --> 56:07.572
Insurance.

56:08.574 --> 56:10.372
I don't want that shit in the car.

56:10.534 --> 56:13.378
We'll be running two cars
next time, brother.

56:13.537 --> 56:14.663
They'll ride with me.

56:21.086 --> 56:22.759
So, this is your plan?

56:22.921 --> 56:26.804
We're just gonna sit here and see
if this is the branch they rob next.

56:26.967 --> 56:28.093
What would you rather do?

56:28.260 --> 56:29.933
You wanna drive 80 miles back to Olney

56:30.095 --> 56:32.814
and look for more fingerprints
that we ain't gonna find?

56:32.973 --> 56:35.726
Or you wanna drive 200 miles
back to Lubbock

56:35.893 --> 56:38.021
and look at mugshots that don't matter
'cause nobody knows

56:38.186 --> 56:39.733
what these sons of bitches look like?

56:39.897 --> 56:42.491
Or we can just wait here
for them to rob this bank,

56:42.649 --> 56:45.368
which is the one thing I'm pretty
damn sure they are going to do.

56:45.527 --> 56:46.699
I know what you're doing.

56:48.113 --> 56:50.115
You're trying to make this last
as long as you can

56:50.282 --> 56:53.210
because the longer it lasts,
the farther you are from that front porch.

56:53.368 --> 56:55.871
No, I'm waitin' for these boys
to make a mistake.

56:56.038 --> 56:57.665
So far they ain't, but they will.

56:57.831 --> 56:59.083
And they're gonna make it here.

57:00.417 --> 57:01.919
So, just relax.

57:03.211 --> 57:04.758
Enjoy this little town.

57:04.922 --> 57:06.174
Do you wanna live here?

57:06.340 --> 57:10.307
Got an old hardware store that
charges twice what Home Depot does,

57:10.469 --> 57:14.394
one restaurant with
a rattlesnake for a waitress.

57:14.556 --> 57:17.400
I mean, how is anybody
supposed to make a living here?

57:17.559 --> 57:20.233
People have made a living here
for 150 years.

57:20.395 --> 57:23.069
Well, people lived in caves
for 150,000 years,

57:23.231 --> 57:24.483
but they don't do it no more.

57:24.650 --> 57:27.324
Well, maybe your people did.

57:27.486 --> 57:29.079
Your people did, too.

57:30.656 --> 57:33.580
A long time ago,
your ancestors was the Indians...

57:35.118 --> 57:37.496
till someone came along and killed them,

57:37.663 --> 57:40.758
broke 'em down, made you into one of them.

57:42.250 --> 57:47.097
150 years ago, all this
was my ancestors' land.

57:48.674 --> 57:50.301
Everything you can see.

57:51.551 --> 57:53.394
Everything you saw yesterday.

57:54.596 --> 57:57.145
Till the grandparents
of these folks took it.

57:59.518 --> 58:01.316
And now, it's been taken from them.

58:02.646 --> 58:04.648
Except it ain't no army doing it.

58:05.983 --> 58:08.111
It's those sons of bitches right there.

58:18.370 --> 58:19.667
You thinking about tomorrow?

58:22.124 --> 58:23.296
Ain't you?

58:24.543 --> 58:26.045
The little hotel clerk.

58:28.005 --> 58:29.598
Why is it always the sweet ones

58:29.756 --> 58:32.430
that are such devils
when you get them revved up?

58:33.844 --> 58:36.142
Wouldn't know. Never had a sweet one.

58:37.472 --> 58:40.976
Yeah, you like them pissed off,
lookin' for someone to blame.

58:42.769 --> 58:44.271
Sure seems that way.

58:56.783 --> 58:58.160
It's a good thing you're doing.

59:01.371 --> 59:02.497
We're doing it.

59:17.804 --> 59:19.772
Go easy on the bank teller tomorrow.

59:21.141 --> 59:23.564
I'll be as gentle as a young nurse.

01:00:28.041 --> 01:00:29.088
You coming?

01:00:30.210 --> 01:00:31.427
On my way.

01:01:15.672 --> 01:01:16.719
Hey.

01:01:17.799 --> 01:01:18.846
Shit.

01:01:23.054 --> 01:01:24.146
Morning.

01:01:26.641 --> 01:01:27.688
You want some breakfast?

01:01:27.851 --> 01:01:29.603
Yeah, breakfast sounds good.

01:01:34.274 --> 01:01:37.369
So we hit the Jayton branch first,
then Coleman, right?

01:01:37.527 --> 01:01:39.200
Yeah, that should get us what we need.

01:02:34.834 --> 01:02:36.086
Let's do this.

01:02:39.547 --> 01:02:42.096
Ugh... shit.

01:02:43.093 --> 01:02:44.310
That's not part of the fucking plan.

01:02:44.469 --> 01:02:45.971
The bastards closed down the branch.

01:02:48.390 --> 01:02:49.482
What now, little brother?

01:02:51.685 --> 01:02:52.902
Coleman.

01:03:27.804 --> 01:03:29.806
- What the hell you doing?
- We gotta head to Post.

01:03:29.973 --> 01:03:31.316
- What the hell are you doing?
- Get...

01:03:37.981 --> 01:03:40.234
- We got to head to Post.
- What are you talking about?

01:03:40.400 --> 01:03:42.198
We got to head to Post.

01:03:42.360 --> 01:03:43.452
We're going to Coleman.

01:03:43.611 --> 01:03:44.954
There's only one teller in Coleman.

01:03:45.113 --> 01:03:46.535
Whatever we get won't be enough.

01:03:48.116 --> 01:03:49.208
We go to Coleman right now.

01:03:49.367 --> 01:03:50.493
If that ain't enough, we head to Post.

01:03:50.660 --> 01:03:53.163
If we don't leave now for Post,
we won't get there till noon.

01:03:53.330 --> 01:03:55.048
You don't wanna rob a bank
at lunchtime, do you?

01:03:56.207 --> 01:03:57.709
Yeah, we don't know the patterns
of folks out there.

01:03:57.876 --> 01:03:59.423
The patterns are the same everywhere.

01:03:59.586 --> 01:04:01.680
All these towns are dead.
Post ain't no different.

01:04:02.922 --> 01:04:04.014
It's a bigger bank.

01:04:05.133 --> 01:04:07.101
We'll leave your car just out of town.

01:04:07.260 --> 01:04:08.352
Come on, now.

01:04:09.387 --> 01:04:11.060
Shit.

01:04:18.688 --> 01:04:20.235
I think I got this figured.

01:04:21.358 --> 01:04:25.738
First two banks,
they were Texas Midland Banks.

01:04:26.738 --> 01:04:28.786
All right, there are seven
branches altogether.

01:04:28.948 --> 01:04:31.076
The main branch is in Fort Worth.

01:04:31.242 --> 01:04:32.710
They're not gonna mess with that.

01:04:34.037 --> 01:04:37.462
All right, they hit the branch in Olney.

01:04:37.624 --> 01:04:40.252
They hit the one in Archer City.

01:04:40.418 --> 01:04:43.388
- Then there's the one here.
- Which they did not hit.

01:04:45.006 --> 01:04:49.102
Alberto, will you please follow me?

01:04:50.678 --> 01:04:54.641
Don't let... just keep your mouth shut
and just listen to what I'm gonna say.

01:04:54.808 --> 01:04:56.230
There's the one here...

01:04:57.477 --> 01:04:59.354
then there's the one in Childress.

01:04:59.521 --> 01:05:00.864
There's the one in Jayton.

01:05:01.022 --> 01:05:02.365
That one's closed.

01:05:02.524 --> 01:05:04.276
I know that one's closed!

01:05:07.070 --> 01:05:09.664
I know that one's closed, Alberto.

01:05:12.534 --> 01:05:14.036
That's my point.

01:05:14.202 --> 01:05:16.625
Jayton is closed.

01:05:16.788 --> 01:05:18.290
That just leaves Post.

01:05:18.456 --> 01:05:20.003
They're not gonna mess
with the bank in Childress.

01:05:20.166 --> 01:05:23.386
That's a fairly decent-sized town.

01:05:23.545 --> 01:05:26.264
The branch in Vernon
wasn't Midlands and they hit that.

01:05:26.423 --> 01:05:28.801
Yeah, one of them did. Alone.

01:05:28.967 --> 01:05:31.061
Then he ran all the way
across the road to get to the car.

01:05:32.053 --> 01:05:34.272
I think his partner had no idea
that was gonna happen.

01:05:34.431 --> 01:05:35.523
What does that mean to us?

01:05:35.682 --> 01:05:39.277
It means that the only branch
that fits the bill is in Post.

01:05:39.436 --> 01:05:40.483
Well, then let's go.

01:06:08.965 --> 01:06:10.217
The town looks busy.

01:06:11.885 --> 01:06:12.932
Little bit.

01:06:21.561 --> 01:06:23.063
My word.

01:06:33.531 --> 01:06:34.874
It's too big.

01:06:35.033 --> 01:06:36.330
That's what she said.

01:06:39.621 --> 01:06:41.544
It's no good.

01:06:41.706 --> 01:06:43.800
Aw, this ain't your first rodeo.

01:06:46.085 --> 01:06:47.257
Bigger bank...

01:06:49.422 --> 01:06:50.594
more money.

01:07:09.526 --> 01:07:12.245
Everybody, get on the fucking ground!

01:07:12.403 --> 01:07:13.996
Get on the fucking ground!

01:07:14.155 --> 01:07:17.409
Young ladies, get on
the fucking ground! Now!

01:07:17.575 --> 01:07:21.876
Sir, down! On the ground! Now!

01:07:22.038 --> 01:07:23.585
Thank you very much.

01:07:27.335 --> 01:07:28.587
Tellers, stand up!

01:07:30.838 --> 01:07:32.761
Open the drawers!

01:07:35.969 --> 01:07:37.937
Get down!

01:07:38.096 --> 01:07:40.144
Take three steps back!

01:07:40.306 --> 01:07:42.684
Open the fucking drawer, young lady!

01:07:42.850 --> 01:07:44.272
Are you deaf and dumb?

01:07:44.435 --> 01:07:46.654
I said open the motherfucking drawer!

01:07:46.813 --> 01:07:48.440
- You, down!
- All right. Oh, please.

01:07:48.606 --> 01:07:50.449
Now step back!

01:07:51.693 --> 01:07:52.694
Very good.

01:07:52.860 --> 01:07:54.703
Someone's paying attention.

01:07:56.573 --> 01:08:00.669
Now get on your motherfucking knees!

01:08:00.827 --> 01:08:01.919
Hey!

01:08:02.912 --> 01:08:04.380
Stay down!

01:08:12.839 --> 01:08:14.091
All right.

01:08:35.194 --> 01:08:36.446
Dude.

01:08:48.374 --> 01:08:49.546
Hey, hey, let's go!

01:08:49.709 --> 01:08:51.051
Call 911!

01:08:52.587 --> 01:08:54.055
Jesus fucking Christ.

01:08:55.673 --> 01:08:57.550
The whole goddamn town is shooting at us.

01:08:58.885 --> 01:09:01.138
Get in the back. Get in the fucking back.

01:09:14.192 --> 01:09:16.194
Come on, let's go! Get in the car!

01:09:16.361 --> 01:09:17.453
Don't let them get away!

01:09:20.865 --> 01:09:22.959
How you doing back there, little brother?

01:09:23.117 --> 01:09:24.460
You fucking killed them.

01:09:24.618 --> 01:09:28.377
These concealed carry permits sure
complicate a bank robbery, don't they?

01:09:28.538 --> 01:09:30.166
It's not my fault it was payday.

01:09:35.087 --> 01:09:36.465
This has gone too far, Tan.

01:09:36.631 --> 01:09:38.508
No one was supposed to fucking die.

01:09:38.675 --> 01:09:41.224
It was them or us. Take your pick.

01:09:55.858 --> 01:09:57.485
Yeah, go, Margaret.

01:09:57.652 --> 01:09:59.871
Texas Midlands in Post has just been hit.

01:10:00.029 --> 01:10:02.327
Ah! What did I tell you?

01:10:02.490 --> 01:10:03.537
Yeah.

01:10:03.700 --> 01:10:05.668
- Yeah!
- Locals are in chase.

01:10:05.827 --> 01:10:09.293
Suspects escaping west in an old Bronco.

01:10:09.455 --> 01:10:11.924
All right, Margaret, keep us posted.
We're on our way there.

01:10:12.083 --> 01:10:13.926
Give me an Indian whoop. Come on.

01:10:16.546 --> 01:10:18.093
These boys are gonna go down.

01:10:18.256 --> 01:10:20.930
Let's get some giddy-up music
going on there.

01:10:25.263 --> 01:10:26.310
Oh, please, not that.

01:10:46.033 --> 01:10:47.125
Yeah.

01:10:49.078 --> 01:10:52.332
Hey, hey. Come on. Snap out of it.

01:10:55.835 --> 01:10:58.338
Snap the fuck out of it.

01:10:58.504 --> 01:11:00.677
Shit, let me see that. You're hit.

01:11:00.840 --> 01:11:02.308
Boy, you're hit. Get the back.

01:11:04.677 --> 01:11:07.396
Well, you'll live.
It's a through and through.

01:11:07.555 --> 01:11:11.230
Compress it. Wrap it up.
You got to wrap it up tight.

01:11:11.392 --> 01:11:12.769
Front and back, front and back.

01:11:15.438 --> 01:11:16.485
Wrap it tight.

01:11:22.862 --> 01:11:25.911
Oh, brother, hear me now, hear me clear.

01:11:26.073 --> 01:11:28.667
Unless you wanna be a black mark
on your sons' lives,

01:11:28.826 --> 01:11:30.920
I need you mountain lion mean.

01:11:31.078 --> 01:11:32.796
You hear me?

01:11:32.955 --> 01:11:34.047
I hear you.

01:11:34.207 --> 01:11:35.459
- Mountain lion mean.
- Yeah.

01:11:35.625 --> 01:11:39.471
Yeah. It's gonna be okay.
It's gonna be okay.

01:11:39.629 --> 01:11:40.801
- Hold on.
- Yeah.

01:12:37.812 --> 01:12:38.813
Go.

01:12:50.241 --> 01:12:51.367
Here, take the money.

01:12:55.872 --> 01:12:57.340
- Let's go.
- Get to the casino.

01:12:57.498 --> 01:12:58.750
Change the money like we planned.

01:12:58.916 --> 01:13:02.216
This was your plan, and it worked.

01:13:02.378 --> 01:13:03.721
Every step of the way.

01:13:04.881 --> 01:13:06.098
Trust it.

01:13:11.596 --> 01:13:12.848
Where are you headed?

01:13:18.936 --> 01:13:20.028
Don't be stupid.

01:13:23.649 --> 01:13:24.946
I love you, Toby.

01:13:28.696 --> 01:13:29.822
I mean it.

01:13:37.038 --> 01:13:38.335
I love you, too.

01:13:44.211 --> 01:13:46.555
Hey, Tobe, go fuck yourself.

01:13:46.714 --> 01:13:47.886
Go fuck yourself.

01:14:04.607 --> 01:14:08.157
As I walked out one sunny morning

01:14:08.319 --> 01:14:11.664
I spied a young cowboy a loping along

01:14:11.822 --> 01:14:13.699
His hat was laid back

01:14:13.866 --> 01:14:15.834
His spurs were a jinglin'

01:14:15.993 --> 01:14:19.372
And as he come near me
He's singing this song

01:14:24.460 --> 01:14:26.963
Yippee hiyiyo. You little doggies.

01:14:27.129 --> 01:14:30.679
It's your misfortune and none of my own

01:14:59.578 --> 01:15:02.172
This is what they call
white man's intuition.

01:15:03.374 --> 01:15:05.547
Sometimes a blind pig finds a truffle.

01:15:12.675 --> 01:15:17.181
It's your misfortune and none of my own

01:16:00.973 --> 01:16:03.692
Back up! Oh, shit!

01:16:03.851 --> 01:16:05.478
Go! Move!

01:16:16.489 --> 01:16:17.832
My word.

01:16:17.990 --> 01:16:22.078
All right, We're gonna need a SWAT unit
up here and a helo to pin these boys down.

01:16:33.172 --> 01:16:35.015
Suspect is a white male.

01:16:36.383 --> 01:16:37.430
Guys, spread it out!

01:16:39.136 --> 01:16:40.353
He's got a rifle. Get down!

01:16:40.513 --> 01:16:42.390
He's on the ridge! He's on the ridge!

01:16:44.767 --> 01:16:46.144
Come on, I see him!

01:16:49.021 --> 01:16:50.022
There's just one?

01:16:50.189 --> 01:16:51.361
Yep, just one.

01:16:51.524 --> 01:16:52.776
There's supposed to be two of them.

01:16:52.942 --> 01:16:54.990
Maybe the town folks got one.

01:16:56.529 --> 01:16:58.623
Well, if they did, they got the smart one.

01:16:58.781 --> 01:17:00.783
This old boy is out of his mind.

01:17:00.950 --> 01:17:04.580
Why don't you slip up this canyon
and tomahawk that son of a bitch?

01:17:23.556 --> 01:17:25.558
Ranger down. Call it in.

01:17:25.724 --> 01:17:29.649
Get back! Back! Back those trucks up!

01:17:31.313 --> 01:17:32.439
Get back!

01:17:33.691 --> 01:17:35.159
Get these trucks back.

01:17:35.317 --> 01:17:36.990
Back up!

01:17:39.363 --> 01:17:40.455
Back them up.

01:17:40.614 --> 01:17:42.082
How well do you know the land around here?

01:17:42.241 --> 01:17:44.164
Like the back of my hand.

01:17:44.326 --> 01:17:46.749
All right, he's hid up
in that brush on that hill.

01:17:46.912 --> 01:17:48.414
Can you get me up there behind him?

01:17:48.581 --> 01:17:52.502
Give me a half hour, I'll have that bastard
field dressed on the hood of my truck.

01:17:52.668 --> 01:17:54.420
I can't let you do that.
You just get me there.

01:17:54.587 --> 01:17:56.635
That's gonna be a 500-yard shot
if he's where you said.

01:17:56.797 --> 01:17:57.923
Just get me there!

01:18:12.605 --> 01:18:13.777
Shit.

01:18:58.150 --> 01:18:59.276
How are you doing?

01:18:59.443 --> 01:19:01.662
Good. You?

01:19:01.820 --> 01:19:03.072
Where are you headed?

01:19:03.239 --> 01:19:04.331
Ruidoso.

01:19:06.492 --> 01:19:07.539
Where you from?

01:19:07.701 --> 01:19:08.748
Hamlin.

01:19:11.455 --> 01:19:12.627
Taking the scenic route?

01:19:13.666 --> 01:19:16.260
Taking the only way I can.

01:19:16.418 --> 01:19:17.635
They got the road closed at Post.

01:19:17.795 --> 01:19:19.718
Everywhere you turn
they got the road closed.

01:19:21.298 --> 01:19:23.392
- You got your license on you?
- Yes, I do.

01:19:28.305 --> 01:19:29.397
Wait right there.

01:19:29.556 --> 01:19:30.648
Yes, sir.

01:20:08.679 --> 01:20:10.306
- Sir.
- Yeah.

01:20:11.557 --> 01:20:13.525
Have a good day.

01:20:13.684 --> 01:20:14.776
Thanks much.

01:21:17.373 --> 01:21:19.171
You're pretty winded.

01:21:19.333 --> 01:21:21.961
You oughta let me take the shot.
Hell, it's my gun.

01:21:22.127 --> 01:21:24.255
Not on your life.

01:21:24.421 --> 01:21:25.968
He's mine.

01:21:55.661 --> 01:21:56.833
Just left of the tree.

01:21:56.995 --> 01:21:58.087
I got him.

01:22:14.471 --> 01:22:15.939
I got you.

01:22:24.690 --> 01:22:26.067
Lord of the Plains.

01:22:29.194 --> 01:22:30.411
That's me.

01:23:42.976 --> 01:23:45.570
...definitely something
out of a dime-store novel.

01:23:45.729 --> 01:23:48.573
Texas Highway Patrol and the locals

01:23:48.732 --> 01:23:52.282
chased the robbers
to this hillside behind me,

01:23:52.444 --> 01:23:56.494
20 miles west of town,
where the gunfight continued.

01:23:56.657 --> 01:23:58.079
And right now we do know

01:23:58.242 --> 01:24:02.213
Ranger Marcus Hamilton
killed one of the gunmen

01:24:02.371 --> 01:24:05.921
using a rifle he actually borrowed
from a resident here.

01:24:06.083 --> 01:24:09.132
We don't know the name
of that suspect yet...

01:25:06.393 --> 01:25:07.565
Lucky guy.

01:25:10.022 --> 01:25:12.275
Just in the nick of time, too.

01:25:12.441 --> 01:25:13.613
What are the odds?

01:25:16.903 --> 01:25:20.703
Now, this, uh, satisfies

01:25:20.866 --> 01:25:23.961
both the reverse mortgage loan
and the, uh...

01:25:24.119 --> 01:25:26.747
and the back taxes that we've paid
on your mother's behalf.

01:25:26.913 --> 01:25:29.211
We do that as courtesy, of course.

01:25:33.587 --> 01:25:36.181
You can fax the release of lien
to that number.

01:25:40.093 --> 01:25:41.219
An attorney?

01:25:43.847 --> 01:25:46.521
All right, well, I'll... I'll get that
faxed over to your attorney

01:25:46.683 --> 01:25:47.775
by the end of the week.

01:25:47.934 --> 01:25:50.187
It is the end of the week.
I wanna watch you do it.

01:25:55.067 --> 01:25:58.788
Well, it takes a little time to prepare.

01:25:58.945 --> 01:26:00.242
I got all day.

01:26:09.039 --> 01:26:11.212
Here we go.

01:26:11.375 --> 01:26:14.299
Okay. That's it.

01:26:14.461 --> 01:26:18.261
And it's been a pleasure
doing business with you.

01:26:33.063 --> 01:26:34.406
Let me ask you a question.

01:26:36.191 --> 01:26:37.613
Do y'all manage trusts?

01:26:43.115 --> 01:26:44.992
Hey, Marcus,
ain't you supposed to be retired?

01:26:45.158 --> 01:26:46.205
Howdy.

01:26:51.373 --> 01:26:53.626
- Shelley.
- Nice to see you.

01:26:53.792 --> 01:26:55.669
- Well, hey, Marcus.
- Hey, Margaret.

01:26:55.836 --> 01:26:57.383
Been awhile. How's life as a civilian?

01:26:57.546 --> 01:27:01.050
Oh, just, you know...

01:27:01.216 --> 01:27:04.186
Think I can take a peek
at Mr. Howard's file?

01:27:04.344 --> 01:27:05.516
Tanner Howard.

01:27:07.013 --> 01:27:09.983
Oh, come on.
I ain't got nothing better to do.

01:27:10.142 --> 01:27:11.268
It's at my desk.

01:27:12.394 --> 01:27:13.520
Uh...

01:27:18.734 --> 01:27:21.112
Killed his father
in a hunting accident, huh?

01:27:21.278 --> 01:27:24.202
I'd love to know what he was hunting
in the barn in April.

01:27:24.364 --> 01:27:27.834
10 years in Huntsville
for aggravated assault.

01:27:27.993 --> 01:27:29.586
Cellmate was released in 2012.

01:27:29.745 --> 01:27:33.382
Before that, he served seven years
on bank robbery charges up in Big Spring.

01:27:33.540 --> 01:27:35.793
Been trying to track him down,
but no luck so far.

01:27:35.959 --> 01:27:37.677
You all are off the brother?

01:27:37.836 --> 01:27:39.759
There's nothing that links him
to the robberies.

01:27:40.922 --> 01:27:43.141
Now, what about
that little waitress in Vernon?

01:27:43.300 --> 01:27:44.392
Yeah, we showed her photos.

01:27:44.551 --> 01:27:46.269
She said she didn't recognize him.

01:27:46.428 --> 01:27:48.726
Pretty upset you took
her tips as evidence.

01:27:50.307 --> 01:27:51.900
She sure was sassy.

01:27:52.058 --> 01:27:53.810
You show that to that old timer?

01:27:53.977 --> 01:27:56.696
Yep. He said he didn't look
like the fella from the diner.

01:27:56.855 --> 01:27:59.153
He didn't recognize Tanner's photo either.

01:27:59.316 --> 01:28:02.286
Yeah, tried to get a court order
on his bank accounts and the ranch,

01:28:02.444 --> 01:28:03.491
DA wouldn't do it.

01:28:03.653 --> 01:28:06.156
Toby's got no record.
He's never been arrested.

01:28:06.323 --> 01:28:08.451
His only court appearance
was at his divorce.

01:28:08.617 --> 01:28:10.619
He don't fit the bill, Marcus.

01:28:10.786 --> 01:28:12.208
People don't start out robbing banks.

01:28:12.370 --> 01:28:14.668
They graduate to it
like his asshole brother.

01:28:14.831 --> 01:28:18.051
Besides, when we was out there,
we saw two crews from Chevron

01:28:18.210 --> 01:28:20.463
capping wells and putting in pumpjacks.

01:28:20.629 --> 01:28:24.558
Engineers out there said they're gonna
pull 2,000 barrels a month off that place.

01:28:24.716 --> 01:28:27.265
You just try convincing a judge
to issue warrants on somebody

01:28:27.427 --> 01:28:29.100
set to clear $50,000 a month

01:28:29.262 --> 01:28:32.357
for robbing $40,000 from the bank
that manages the family trust.

01:28:32.516 --> 01:28:34.564
Midland manages the trust?

01:28:37.896 --> 01:28:40.069
You'd think they'd want
this thing figured out.

01:28:40.232 --> 01:28:42.109
I don't think the bank cares
about anything

01:28:42.275 --> 01:28:43.948
but keeping that trust right where it is.

01:28:45.028 --> 01:28:47.451
Hell, they were less cooperative
than Toby's attorney.

01:28:49.825 --> 01:28:53.079
Marcus, he's not a suspect
and you are retired.

01:28:54.120 --> 01:28:55.292
Oh, I hear you.

01:28:59.376 --> 01:29:00.753
You like my desk?

01:29:02.128 --> 01:29:03.220
I don't hate it.

01:29:06.132 --> 01:29:07.429
Hey, I'll see you, Marcus.

01:30:44.272 --> 01:30:45.740
Know who I am?

01:30:50.070 --> 01:30:52.368
I'm the man who killed your brother.

01:30:52.530 --> 01:30:53.656
I know.

01:30:55.450 --> 01:30:57.794
I also know you're retired
and you're trespassing.

01:30:59.079 --> 01:31:02.800
Well, you could shoot me now
and be within your rights.

01:31:02.958 --> 01:31:05.962
You toting a gun and all, how convenient.

01:31:07.128 --> 01:31:08.721
I figure you got one, too.

01:31:14.761 --> 01:31:16.058
Mind if I sit?

01:31:20.684 --> 01:31:21.731
Go ahead.

01:31:45.291 --> 01:31:46.508
You want a beer?

01:31:47.711 --> 01:31:50.715
Sure. I ain't on duty no more.

01:32:01.349 --> 01:32:02.350
Thanks.

01:32:07.605 --> 01:32:11.985
It's nice out here in this breeze,
huh, now that it's cooled down.

01:32:22.704 --> 01:32:23.830
How did you do it?

01:32:26.166 --> 01:32:27.418
Oh, never mind.

01:32:27.584 --> 01:32:29.507
I'll figure that out in time.

01:32:29.669 --> 01:32:31.763
Why? Why did you do it?

01:32:33.590 --> 01:32:36.013
I know why your brother, Tanner, did it.

01:32:36.176 --> 01:32:39.020
He robbed them banks because he liked it.

01:32:41.473 --> 01:32:44.727
He shot my partner 300 yards away
'cause he liked it.

01:32:44.893 --> 01:32:46.065
It made him feel good.

01:32:48.730 --> 01:32:50.778
If I hadn't blown his shit for brains out,

01:32:50.940 --> 01:32:54.410
there'd be a new truck out front
with jet skis

01:32:54.569 --> 01:32:56.446
or whatever else he could think to buy.

01:32:56.613 --> 01:33:00.834
He'd spend it all just to give
an excuse to steal some more.

01:33:00.992 --> 01:33:02.369
But not you.

01:33:04.954 --> 01:33:06.956
There's nothing new around here...

01:33:08.208 --> 01:33:11.087
except them pumpjacks.

01:33:11.252 --> 01:33:12.845
Each one of them making you a month

01:33:13.004 --> 01:33:16.258
what you and your brother stole
from all four banks combined.

01:33:17.717 --> 01:33:19.310
Help me understand, then.

01:33:22.097 --> 01:33:24.350
Help me understand why four people died...

01:33:26.142 --> 01:33:29.942
so you could steal money
that it don't seem you've spent,

01:33:30.105 --> 01:33:32.199
that it don't seem you need.

01:33:32.357 --> 01:33:33.449
You got a family?

01:33:33.608 --> 01:33:35.906
My partner had a family. A big one.

01:33:36.903 --> 01:33:38.905
They don't got no pumpjacks
in their backyard.

01:33:39.072 --> 01:33:41.416
- I didn't kill your friend.
- Yes, you did.

01:33:42.909 --> 01:33:44.957
By setting this thing in motion.

01:33:46.162 --> 01:33:49.336
You expect me to believe
your dimwitted brother planned this?

01:33:50.542 --> 01:33:53.591
Oh, no. This was smart.

01:33:53.753 --> 01:33:54.970
This was you.

01:33:58.842 --> 01:34:00.640
I've been poor my whole life.

01:34:04.305 --> 01:34:06.728
So were my parents,
their parents before them.

01:34:09.102 --> 01:34:10.604
It's like a disease...

01:34:12.313 --> 01:34:15.283
passing from generation to generation,
becomes a sickness.

01:34:15.441 --> 01:34:16.533
That's what it is.

01:34:18.361 --> 01:34:20.034
Infects every person you know...

01:34:21.239 --> 01:34:22.707
but not my boys.

01:34:24.409 --> 01:34:25.706
Not anymore.

01:34:29.455 --> 01:34:30.752
This is theirs now.

01:34:35.253 --> 01:34:37.096
Now, I ain't never killed
no one in my life,

01:34:37.255 --> 01:34:40.259
but if you want me to start with you,
let's get on with it, old man.

01:34:42.051 --> 01:34:45.100
See if you can grab that pistol
before I blast you off this porch.

01:35:24.636 --> 01:35:26.388
- Howdy.
- What's going on?

01:35:28.056 --> 01:35:30.525
The hogs are back in the garden.

01:35:30.683 --> 01:35:33.152
Feral hogs tearing up this place
something fierce.

01:35:34.896 --> 01:35:35.943
Who's this?

01:35:36.105 --> 01:35:37.857
I'm an old friend of your husband.

01:35:38.900 --> 01:35:40.117
Ex-husband.

01:35:42.070 --> 01:35:43.413
I'm just working on the house.

01:35:44.530 --> 01:35:46.248
Oh, you don't live here?

01:35:46.407 --> 01:35:49.206
No, it's not mine. It's theirs.

01:35:51.788 --> 01:35:53.381
Oh.

01:35:53.539 --> 01:35:55.962
The things we do for our kids, huh?

01:35:58.544 --> 01:35:59.591
Well...

01:36:01.631 --> 01:36:02.803
I best be going.

01:36:02.966 --> 01:36:04.092
Ma'am.

01:36:04.259 --> 01:36:06.057
Me, too, Debbie. I'm gonna wash up,

01:36:06.219 --> 01:36:08.847
be back around 9:00 tomorrow
to finish the front.

01:36:09.013 --> 01:36:11.437
Start painting the extension
and then help Randy with his homework

01:36:11.599 --> 01:36:14.478
when he gets back from school, okay?

01:36:14.644 --> 01:36:15.691
Okay.

01:36:18.940 --> 01:36:20.237
Hey.

01:36:21.484 --> 01:36:23.407
I rent a little house in town.

01:36:25.280 --> 01:36:28.415
If you wanna stop by and finish this
conversation, you're welcome anytime.

01:36:29.867 --> 01:36:31.369
Oh, I'd like that.

01:36:32.495 --> 01:36:33.667
I'll be seeing you.

01:36:33.830 --> 01:36:36.583
Yeah. Soon, I hope.

01:36:39.085 --> 01:36:40.553
I'm ready to be done with this.

01:36:40.712 --> 01:36:42.840
You'll never be done with it
no matter what.

01:36:43.006 --> 01:36:45.555
It's gonna haunt you, son,
for the rest of your days.

01:36:46.592 --> 01:36:48.344
But you won't be alone.

01:36:48.511 --> 01:36:50.058
It's gonna haunt me, too.

01:36:50.221 --> 01:36:52.315
If you stop by, maybe I'll give you peace.

01:36:52.473 --> 01:36:56.353
Maybe. Maybe I'll give it to you.
