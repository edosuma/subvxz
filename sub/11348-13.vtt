00:06.640 --> 00:07.541
(male announcer)
In the criminal justice system,

00:08.742 --> 00:12.346
sexually based offenses are
considered especially heinous.

00:12.380 --> 00:14.782
In New York City,
the dedicated detectives

00:14.815 --> 00:16.584
who investigate
these vicious felonies

00:16.617 --> 00:18.319
are members of an elite squad

00:18.352 --> 00:20.188
known as
the Special Victims Unit.

00:20.221 --> 00:22.556
These are their stories.

00:24.092 --> 00:25.659
A yoga retreat
in Costa Rica.

00:25.693 --> 00:27.828
It was the furthest I could get
away from New York

00:27.861 --> 00:28.829
and Atlanta.

00:28.862 --> 00:30.164
It was good.

00:30.198 --> 00:33.234
Work through some stuff?

00:33.267 --> 00:35.169
It was therapeutic.

00:35.203 --> 00:40.241
We were meditating on
the summit of this volcano,

00:40.274 --> 00:43.577
and the yogi comes over,
and taps me on my shoulder.

00:43.611 --> 00:45.146
I didn't even tense up.

00:46.314 --> 00:48.282
- Good for you.
- Yeah.

00:48.316 --> 00:49.750
And now that you're back,
you'll continue with therapy?

00:49.783 --> 00:53.287
Look, I am so sorry for
what I put you all through.

00:53.321 --> 00:55.856
No, Amanda.

00:55.889 --> 00:58.659
I'm sorry for what you
put yourself through.

01:02.230 --> 01:05.266
[breathing hard]

01:06.300 --> 01:07.735
Damn.

01:07.768 --> 01:08.836
You looking way too pretty

01:08.869 --> 01:10.238
to be walking
all by yourself.

01:10.271 --> 01:13.574
Huh?

01:13.607 --> 01:15.343
(man)
Hey, hey.

01:15.376 --> 01:17.778
God bless you, mami.

01:17.811 --> 01:21.315
What's up with you,
little girl, huh?

01:21.349 --> 01:23.784
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
mami, mami.

01:23.817 --> 01:25.453
You need some help?

01:25.486 --> 01:27.288
'Cause I can help you out
real nice,

01:27.321 --> 01:28.489
you know what I'm saying?

01:28.522 --> 01:30.324
- Get away from me.
- All right, all right.

01:30.358 --> 01:32.460
You have a sweet night,
okay, girl?

01:38.332 --> 01:39.533
[horn honking]

01:42.903 --> 01:46.106
[breathing heavily]

01:54.382 --> 01:55.349
[knocks on door]

01:55.383 --> 01:56.417
(man)
Hey.

01:56.450 --> 01:57.651
[knocking continues]

01:57.685 --> 01:58.919
Hey, open up.

01:58.952 --> 02:00.788
No, please just go away,
please.

02:00.821 --> 02:02.290
(man)
Yo, you good in there or what?

02:02.323 --> 02:03.824
[keys jingling]
I got customers out here
waiting.

02:03.857 --> 02:06.427
- Go away, please!
- Open the door.

02:06.460 --> 02:08.496
(man)
I'm coming in now,
all right?

02:08.529 --> 02:09.563
Fair warning.

02:09.597 --> 02:11.265
- No, please.
- Calm down.

02:11.299 --> 02:13.534
No. No. No.

02:13.567 --> 02:15.369
No, I got you.

02:15.403 --> 02:16.704
No, please.

02:16.737 --> 02:17.705
Please, no.

02:17.738 --> 02:18.772
I guess January

02:18.806 --> 02:20.308
was pretty crappy
for everybody.

02:20.341 --> 02:21.842
Heard Nick
went through hell.

02:21.875 --> 02:25.879
Winter at SVU,
Nick's dad, Noah's lungs.

02:25.913 --> 02:27.348
Every time he wheezes,

02:27.381 --> 02:29.817
I'm afraid it's another trip
to the E.R.

02:29.850 --> 02:31.252
He'll be okay.

02:35.789 --> 02:36.857
All right, then.

02:36.890 --> 02:38.292
I'll see you tomorrow.

02:38.326 --> 02:41.429
Yeah, I'll be early.

02:41.462 --> 02:44.298
(woman)
Stop touching me!
Get off me!

02:44.332 --> 02:46.334
(man)
Look, I'm trying to
give you your purse.

02:46.367 --> 02:48.236
man: Don't kick.
Olivia: Hey! Hey, hey, hey!

02:48.269 --> 02:50.271
- Police, police.
man: Chill, okay?

02:50.304 --> 02:51.705
I didn't do nothing.

02:51.739 --> 02:53.841
- He took my purse!
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

02:53.874 --> 02:55.376
- You got the wrong idea, okay?
- Calm down, calm down.

02:55.409 --> 02:56.377
I didn't do nothing.

02:56.410 --> 02:58.546
- Hey, calm down.
- Please! He attacked me.

02:58.579 --> 03:00.681
- Hey, you lying!
- Put your hands up.

03:00.714 --> 03:02.350
I'm trying to
help you, okay?

03:02.383 --> 03:03.717
Then arrest him!
He raped me!

03:06.820 --> 03:08.822
Okay.

03:11.959 --> 03:13.727
[handcuffs
clinking]

03:17.698 --> 03:20.668
[dramatic music]

04:05.279 --> 04:05.546
.

04:05.579 --> 04:06.113
(Rollins)
Okay, thank you.

04:07.548 --> 04:08.816
I was able to reach
the parents.

04:08.849 --> 04:09.817
It's Luke and Marcy Davis.

04:09.850 --> 04:10.951
They're on their way.

04:10.984 --> 04:12.820
- How is Jenna?
- She's recovering.

04:12.853 --> 04:14.688
She had alcohol mixed
with Clonazepam in her system.

04:14.722 --> 04:16.657
That explains why
she was so out of it.

04:16.690 --> 04:18.726
Any prelims
from the rape exam?

04:18.759 --> 04:20.394
Slight bruising on
the wrist and thighs,

04:20.428 --> 04:21.662
possible semen
on the sweater,

04:21.695 --> 04:24.298
and evidence of
torn hymenal tissue.

04:24.332 --> 04:25.699
Have you talked to her yet?

04:25.733 --> 04:27.668
She fell asleep right
after the exam.

04:27.701 --> 04:29.737
The nurse she'll let us know
when she wakes up.

04:29.770 --> 04:30.938
Torn hymenal tissue.

04:30.971 --> 04:32.673
So this guy rapes
a semi-conscious

04:32.706 --> 04:37.511
16-year-old virgin on the floor
of a pizzeria bathroom.

04:37.545 --> 04:39.847
Welcome back to SVU.

04:39.880 --> 04:42.483
Hey, you making
a big mistake.

04:42.516 --> 04:43.717
(Amaro)
Yeah, are we?

04:43.751 --> 04:45.553
My sergeant and a detective

04:45.586 --> 04:46.954
witnessed you
assaulting this girl.

04:46.987 --> 04:48.556
No, I wasn't
assaulting her.

04:48.589 --> 04:49.790
- I was trying to help her.
- Help her?

04:49.823 --> 04:51.625
Then how come she's
accusing you of rape?

04:51.659 --> 04:52.660
Man, she was
out of her mind.

04:52.693 --> 04:53.994
She was drugged or drunk.

04:54.027 --> 04:55.429
I don't know.

04:55.463 --> 04:56.730
Yeah, so you call 911.

04:56.764 --> 04:57.765
We got witnesses saying
that you

04:57.798 --> 04:59.099
went into the bathroom
after her.

04:59.132 --> 05:00.568
That's because
I had customers

05:00.601 --> 05:02.736
waiting in line
for the bathroom.

05:02.770 --> 05:04.705
Look, I didn't touch
that girl.

05:04.738 --> 05:06.407
Look, I know
all you cops hate me,

05:06.440 --> 05:07.808
but this ain't right.

05:07.841 --> 05:10.411
Look, no offense--
we don't even know you.

05:10.444 --> 05:11.712
Now you messing with me.

05:11.745 --> 05:13.046
Look, I know my rights.

05:13.080 --> 05:14.482
Fellas.

05:14.515 --> 05:16.350
Hey, this police harassment!

05:16.384 --> 05:17.418
Just sit down, sir.

05:25.626 --> 05:26.660
What the hell was that?

05:26.694 --> 05:27.895
I don't know.

05:27.928 --> 05:29.397
(Fin)
Prints finally came back.

05:29.430 --> 05:31.665
He is the Jerome Jones.

05:31.699 --> 05:32.900
Who?

05:32.933 --> 05:34.368
Brooklyn Jerome Jones?

05:34.402 --> 05:35.869
Yep.

05:35.903 --> 05:38.005
One of the Prospect Park
three.

05:38.038 --> 05:39.373
Oh, right, right,

05:39.407 --> 05:40.340
those kids held
on a gang rape charge.

05:40.374 --> 05:41.842
All three confessed,
and then some sort of

05:41.875 --> 05:44.812
DNA contamination issue
with the lab.

05:44.845 --> 05:46.680
Then all three recant;
they claim the confessions

05:46.714 --> 05:48.048
- were coerced.
- Yeah.

05:48.081 --> 05:49.249
- So?
- So?

05:49.282 --> 05:52.920
So they have a $36 million suit
pending against the city.

05:52.953 --> 05:54.455
All right, so what?
Brooklyn screws up,

05:54.488 --> 05:56.524
now we can't interrogate
a suspect?

05:56.557 --> 05:58.426
We got witnesses.
Our vic ID'd this guy.

05:58.459 --> 06:00.528
Liv and Amanda
are at the hospital.

06:00.561 --> 06:02.763
The vic was drugged
and disoriented.

06:02.796 --> 06:04.765
No one knows what happened
in that bathroom.

06:04.798 --> 06:05.733
Yeah, because the door
was closed.

06:05.766 --> 06:08.636
(Amaro)
He's talking.
We shouldn't stop now.

06:08.669 --> 06:10.070
Hey, Dodds and Barba called.

06:10.103 --> 06:12.906
They said go easy on Jerome
until Barba gets here.

06:12.940 --> 06:16.444
So what, we see
if this guy's hungry?

06:16.477 --> 06:19.012
Maybe he wants a soda.

06:20.748 --> 06:22.650
That's my little girl.

06:22.683 --> 06:24.084
And where's the bastard
who did it?

06:24.117 --> 06:25.986
We have a suspect
in custody.

06:26.019 --> 06:27.087
We're talking
to him now.

06:27.120 --> 06:28.856
- When can we see Jenna?
- Soon.

06:28.889 --> 06:29.790
Listen, do you know

06:29.823 --> 06:31.559
where your daughter was
this afternoon?

06:31.592 --> 06:33.494
She had a dentist appointment
after school

06:33.527 --> 06:34.895
- and never came home.
- Okay, well, we're gonna need

06:34.928 --> 06:37.765
- to speak with her dentist.
- He's on his way.

06:39.833 --> 06:42.536
He's my brother-in-law,
Dr. Neil Alexander.

06:42.570 --> 06:44.638
He consults with NYPD.

06:44.672 --> 06:45.973
I figured he could
just--

06:46.006 --> 06:47.975
Just wanted to make sure
that we take it seriously?

06:48.008 --> 06:49.743
- Yeah.
- We do.

06:49.777 --> 06:51.144
Listen, right now,
we need to ask you

06:51.178 --> 06:53.180
a few questions
about your daughter.

06:53.213 --> 06:55.949
Has she ever gotten in trouble
with drinking or drugs?

06:55.983 --> 06:57.685
No, she doesn't drink.
She doesn't do drugs.

06:57.718 --> 06:58.952
She's a straight-A student.

06:58.986 --> 06:59.987
Marcy.

07:00.020 --> 07:01.822
Hey.

07:01.855 --> 07:03.156
How is she?

07:03.190 --> 07:04.792
She's asleep.

07:04.825 --> 07:06.527
- I'll go see if she's up.
- Okay.

07:06.560 --> 07:08.028
This is Dr. Alexander.

07:08.061 --> 07:09.863
- This is Sergeant Benson.
- Hey.

07:09.897 --> 07:11.765
Detective Rollins,
Dr. Alexander.

07:11.799 --> 07:12.833
Yeah, we've met.

07:12.866 --> 07:14.702
You testified at
a few trials,

07:14.735 --> 07:16.036
the Ellie Porter case.

07:16.069 --> 07:17.638
The burnt girl,
horrible.

07:17.671 --> 07:19.773
Jenna was just with you
this afternoon, right?

07:19.807 --> 07:22.075
- Yes.
- Okay.

07:22.109 --> 07:23.977
How was her condition
when she left your office?

07:24.011 --> 07:26.747
Did you have to administer gas
or any meds?

07:26.780 --> 07:28.682
She needed a filling in her
lower second molar,

07:28.716 --> 07:30.884
so there was some Lidocaine
and there was some nitrous,

07:30.918 --> 07:32.686
but they wear off
rather quickly.

07:32.720 --> 07:34.922
She was fine
by the time she left.

07:34.955 --> 07:36.824
I understand you have
a suspect in custody.

07:36.857 --> 07:38.792
We do, yes.

07:38.826 --> 07:39.827
Okay.

07:39.860 --> 07:41.562
The doctor said
Jenna's waking up.

07:41.595 --> 07:43.797
We have a few questions,
so excuse us.

07:43.831 --> 07:46.266
Luke, you guys should
go in there too.

07:46.299 --> 07:47.735
She's 16.

07:47.768 --> 07:49.169
Of course.

07:49.202 --> 07:51.071
Right this way.

07:51.104 --> 07:52.540
Thanks.

07:52.573 --> 07:54.875
I'm sorry, Mom, Dad.

07:56.810 --> 07:58.812
It's okay, baby.

07:58.846 --> 08:00.748
You didn't do anything wrong.

08:00.781 --> 08:02.850
So can you answer
a few questions?

08:02.883 --> 08:04.752
Yeah, I think I can.

08:04.785 --> 08:07.054
We found you at
a pizza parlor.

08:07.087 --> 08:08.789
Do you remember
how you got there?

08:10.157 --> 08:11.592
No.

08:11.625 --> 08:13.894
No, it's all--

08:13.927 --> 08:15.162
It's all kind of jumbled.

08:15.195 --> 08:17.765
Okay, so let's
take it slow.

08:17.798 --> 08:20.067
What's the last thing
you do remember?

08:20.100 --> 08:22.803
Leaving Uncle Neil's office.

08:22.836 --> 08:24.237
I was gonna go to
my friend Kara's house

08:24.271 --> 08:25.839
and study there,

08:25.873 --> 08:28.075
and then I was gonna
go home after.

08:28.108 --> 08:30.644
(Marcy)
His office is on East 17th.

08:30.678 --> 08:33.080
Kara's on East 15th,
and we live on Grand Street.

08:33.113 --> 08:34.648
And did you make it
to your friend's?

08:34.682 --> 08:35.649
Yeah, yeah.

08:35.683 --> 08:36.817
I was there for a little.

08:36.850 --> 08:38.852
Jenna, you had alcohol
in your system.

08:38.886 --> 08:39.753
Did you drink there?

08:39.787 --> 08:42.155
(Luke)
I told you
she doesn't drink.

08:42.189 --> 08:44.157
He's right;
I don't.

08:44.191 --> 08:46.259
Honey, you're not
in trouble.

08:46.293 --> 08:48.796
Just tell the detectives
the truth.

08:53.000 --> 08:55.703
Um...

08:55.736 --> 08:58.005
I felt sick at Kara's,

08:58.038 --> 09:02.175
so I must have
decided to leave.

09:02.209 --> 09:04.344
And then what happened?

09:04.377 --> 09:06.346
I think I had to
go to the bathroom.

09:06.379 --> 09:09.717
So that's why I went to
the pizza place.

09:09.750 --> 09:11.051
And that guy
was following me,

09:11.084 --> 09:13.153
and he was knocking on the door,
trying to open it,

09:13.186 --> 09:14.622
and I kept telling him
to go away,

09:14.655 --> 09:15.923
but he wouldn't;
he came in.

09:15.956 --> 09:17.591
Son of a bitch.

09:17.625 --> 09:20.728
So do you remember
what happened next?

09:24.932 --> 09:29.903
I remember being cold.

09:29.937 --> 09:32.873
My skirt and my sweater
were pushed up, and...

09:34.775 --> 09:38.879
I felt his belly...
rubbing against mine.

09:38.912 --> 09:41.749
And--

09:41.782 --> 09:43.751
and it hurt,
but I couldn't move, you know?

09:43.784 --> 09:44.885
And...

09:46.920 --> 09:50.057
And then he got it
all over me.

09:50.090 --> 09:51.324
God, Dad, I'm sorry.

09:51.358 --> 09:52.359
I'm really sorry.

09:55.796 --> 09:57.264
It's not your fault, baby.

10:01.769 --> 10:02.936
Not your fault.

10:08.108 --> 10:09.877
Jerome Jones,
he still here?

10:09.910 --> 10:11.912
(Fin)
We're still waiting
on the vic's statement.

10:11.945 --> 10:13.346
What's taking so long?

10:13.380 --> 10:15.816
The girl was intoxicated;
her memory's off.

10:15.849 --> 10:17.851
They did find what might be
semen on her sweater.

10:17.885 --> 10:19.720
- We could put a rush on it.
- On her sweater?

10:19.753 --> 10:20.921
If it is his,
that's probable cause.

10:20.954 --> 10:22.756
If it's not,

10:22.790 --> 10:24.391
then he's extraordinarily
lucky at DNA tests.

10:24.424 --> 10:26.259
He has got ammunition
for another false arrest

10:26.293 --> 10:27.394
and harassment lawsuit.

10:27.427 --> 10:28.896
One more lawsuit
from this guy,

10:28.929 --> 10:30.798
and we're all working
at Staten Island.

10:30.831 --> 10:32.199
(Amaro)
Look, the Prospect Park three
were guilty.

10:32.232 --> 10:33.433
The lab
just screwed it up.

10:33.466 --> 10:34.434
He's guilty of this too.

10:34.467 --> 10:35.435
Make the case airtight,

10:35.468 --> 10:36.904
and I'll charge.

10:36.937 --> 10:37.938
Until then, let him go.

10:37.971 --> 10:39.272
Wait--let him go?

10:39.306 --> 10:40.874
He's waiting on
a $36 million judgment

10:40.908 --> 10:41.942
he'll likely win.

10:41.975 --> 10:44.712
He's not a flight risk.

10:44.745 --> 10:47.247
Get him out of here,
politely.

10:50.083 --> 10:51.685
Who wants to call
the sergeant?

10:51.719 --> 10:53.921
The new guy.

10:53.954 --> 10:55.388
Still?

10:55.422 --> 10:56.824
(Benson)
Cause?

10:56.857 --> 10:58.892
Carisi, she ID'd him.

10:58.926 --> 11:00.127
Okay, I'm sorry.

11:00.160 --> 11:02.329
I know it's not on you.

11:02.362 --> 11:05.866
So re-interview his coworkers.

11:05.899 --> 11:07.334
Put a rush on that DNA.

11:07.367 --> 11:09.436
I need security footage
from the pizza place,

11:09.469 --> 11:11.004
from the street.

11:11.038 --> 11:12.272
Keep pushing.

11:12.305 --> 11:13.941
Sergeant, excuse me.

11:13.974 --> 11:15.442
Carisi,
let me call you back.

11:15.475 --> 11:18.011
I just got a call from an
associate at 1PP.

11:18.045 --> 11:19.279
Tell me this isn't true.

11:19.312 --> 11:20.781
I just found out myself.

11:20.814 --> 11:22.115
But don't worry,
we will make the case.

11:22.149 --> 11:23.450
What's going on?

11:23.483 --> 11:24.752
They're letting
the suspect go.

11:24.785 --> 11:26.186
What?
Why?

11:26.219 --> 11:27.821
You want to tell him this,
or shall I?

11:27.855 --> 11:29.790
We don't have enough
to charge him.

11:29.823 --> 11:31.024
What am I missing?

11:31.058 --> 11:33.060
He's one of the
Prospect Park three.

11:33.093 --> 11:35.095
- He's one of them?
- Yeah.

11:35.128 --> 11:37.130
So he's a known
thug rapist

11:37.164 --> 11:38.832
who got off
on a technicality?

11:38.866 --> 11:40.233
There was a lot of problems
with that case.

11:40.267 --> 11:41.935
It wasn't just a lab issue.

11:41.969 --> 11:43.904
The bottom line is,
he's suing NYPD for millions.

11:43.937 --> 11:45.438
So SVU is treating him
with kid gloves.

11:45.472 --> 11:47.407
Seriously? So you're just
cutting him loose

11:47.440 --> 11:48.876
because of
the pending lawsuit?

11:48.909 --> 11:50.944
We're not dropping the case.

11:50.978 --> 11:52.279
We just have to collect

11:52.312 --> 11:55.082
as much evidence as we can
before charging him.

11:55.115 --> 11:56.750
My daughter was brutalized
by this creep.

11:56.784 --> 11:58.385
You arrested him,
now he's out on the streets.

11:58.418 --> 12:00.153
Who's pulling your strings,
Al Sharpton?

12:00.187 --> 12:01.388
This isn't about politics.

12:01.421 --> 12:02.923
We care about
your daughter.

12:02.956 --> 12:04.958
Not as much as I do.

12:06.927 --> 12:09.930
Let him walk it off,
Sergeant, okay?

12:09.963 --> 12:12.332
(Fin)
We found Jenna's backpack
at Kara's house.

12:12.365 --> 12:14.001
Her mom was there
the whole time.

12:14.034 --> 12:15.302
She says
they weren't partying.

12:15.335 --> 12:17.037
Though she did say Jenna
looked kind of green

12:17.070 --> 12:18.305
when she left
around 6:00.

12:18.338 --> 12:20.908
Well, was the mom
in the room with them?

12:20.941 --> 12:22.876
Okay, I mean, they could've
snuck a drink, popped a pill.

12:22.910 --> 12:25.412
Well, either way,
traffic cams picked Jenna up

12:25.445 --> 12:27.815
two blocks from
the pizza place.

12:27.848 --> 12:29.983
Drunk 16-year-old
teetering on the street.

12:30.017 --> 12:30.984
Fair game.

12:31.018 --> 12:33.486
Once she enters here...

12:33.520 --> 12:37.925
then ten minutes later,
she exits.

12:37.958 --> 12:39.860
We've seen rapes that took
less time than that.

12:39.893 --> 12:41.895
Is there any video of them
in the bathroom together?

12:41.929 --> 12:43.530
(Fin)
Stars Pizza said
there's a glitch

12:43.563 --> 12:44.932
in their security footage.

12:44.965 --> 12:46.166
We sent TARU.

12:46.199 --> 12:47.868
Canvassed three co-workers
on that shift.

12:47.901 --> 12:49.803
See no evil,
hear no evil.

12:49.837 --> 12:52.039
But we did find one customer
tracked by credit card,

12:52.072 --> 12:54.574
who remembered seeing
"an angry black employee"

12:54.607 --> 12:55.809
unlock the bathroom door.

12:55.843 --> 12:57.077
She said she heard
Jenna scream.

12:57.110 --> 12:58.378
Too bad she didn't
call for help.

12:58.411 --> 13:00.047
(Benson)
Well, if she heard Jenna scream,

13:00.080 --> 13:01.481
then somebody else
probably did too.

13:01.514 --> 13:02.582
So keep canvassing.

13:02.615 --> 13:04.384
Push TARU to get
that security footage.

13:04.417 --> 13:05.986
[phone rings]
Barba wants this case airtight,

13:06.019 --> 13:07.387
do it.

13:07.420 --> 13:09.990
Benson.

13:10.023 --> 13:11.491
Yes?

13:13.894 --> 13:14.962
Where?

13:17.630 --> 13:19.599
Okay.

13:19.632 --> 13:20.834
Yeah.

13:20.868 --> 13:22.870
Everything all right, Liv?

13:22.903 --> 13:27.007
Well, looks like we don't
need to put a rush on that DNA.

13:32.112 --> 13:34.614
What happened here,
Mr. Davis?

13:34.647 --> 13:37.584
I was trying to record
a confession.

13:37.617 --> 13:39.186
I didn't mean to kill him.

13:57.404 --> 13:57.537
.

13:57.570 --> 13:57.770
[gasps]

14:00.173 --> 14:01.341
[coughing]

14:01.374 --> 14:03.176
Tell me what you did
to my daughter.

14:03.210 --> 14:04.444
- Nothing.
- Huh?

14:04.477 --> 14:05.478
- Nothing.
- Nothing?

14:05.512 --> 14:07.214
Nothing, no.

14:07.247 --> 14:09.282
[nails banging]

14:09.316 --> 14:10.951
(Luke)
How about now?
Still nothing?

14:10.984 --> 14:13.186
(Jerome)
Are you nuts?
Please, please.

14:13.220 --> 14:16.023
You know where
this is going next?

14:16.056 --> 14:17.390
(Jerome)
Okay, okay.

14:17.424 --> 14:19.226
Okay, okay, please,
please let me go.

14:19.259 --> 14:20.193
Please let me go.

14:20.227 --> 14:21.461
I did it, all right?

14:21.494 --> 14:22.495
- You did what?
- I did it.

14:22.529 --> 14:24.031
I-I raped her.

14:24.064 --> 14:25.232
(Luke)
You raped my daughter.

14:25.265 --> 14:28.035
Say it.
"I raped Jenna."

14:28.068 --> 14:29.436
Say it!

14:29.469 --> 14:31.138
My chest.
My chest.

14:31.171 --> 14:32.405
I need air.

14:32.439 --> 14:34.107
I need--
I need some air.

14:34.141 --> 14:35.108
(Luke)
Say it!

14:35.142 --> 14:36.977
[coughing]

14:37.978 --> 14:39.179
It goes on from there.

14:39.212 --> 14:40.480
He did give CPR.

14:40.513 --> 14:43.316
Yeah, the M.E. thinks Jerome
died of a heart attack

14:43.350 --> 14:44.551
triggered by
his asthma.

14:44.584 --> 14:47.287
Luke Davis called 911.

14:47.320 --> 14:49.456
So he did not intend
to kill Jerome.

14:49.489 --> 14:51.091
Legally it doesn't
make any difference.

14:51.124 --> 14:53.360
Well, that confession
might complicate things.

14:53.393 --> 14:56.696
The nail gun makes that
confession completely coerced.

14:56.729 --> 14:59.232
Either way, Luke Davis
is looking at felony murder.

14:59.266 --> 15:00.500
(Carisi)
You think?

15:00.533 --> 15:02.535
You do know the defendant
gets a free pass on that

15:02.569 --> 15:05.238
if he can show he acted under
extreme emotional duress.

15:05.272 --> 15:06.673
Booyah Fordham Law.

15:06.706 --> 15:08.108
The facts are clear.

15:08.141 --> 15:10.177
Luke Davis kidnaps
Jerome Jones,

15:10.210 --> 15:11.511
tortures him,

15:11.544 --> 15:12.545
within an hour,
Jerome's dead.

15:12.579 --> 15:14.347
He may be dead.

15:14.381 --> 15:15.715
Our job is to figure out
whether or not he is guilty.

15:15.748 --> 15:17.550
So keep pushing for the DNA

15:17.584 --> 15:20.020
and get that security footage
from TARU.

15:20.053 --> 15:21.354
(Fin)
Yes.

15:21.388 --> 15:22.422
And if Jerome is good
for the rape...

15:22.455 --> 15:24.224
But no way a jury
convicts Luke.

15:24.257 --> 15:25.558
Thank you for your support.

15:25.592 --> 15:27.460
If you come to the arraignment,
keep your mouth shut.

15:32.432 --> 15:34.134
(Desappio)
We plead not guilty, your Honor.

15:34.167 --> 15:35.368
That's injustice!

15:35.402 --> 15:37.304
Not guilty?

15:37.337 --> 15:39.139
The D.A.'s overcharging
because the deceased

15:39.172 --> 15:42.042
has a significant lawsuit
outstanding against the city.

15:42.075 --> 15:44.711
He killed my baby,
ruined my family.

15:44.744 --> 15:46.213
[gavel bangs]
Order.

15:47.480 --> 15:48.481
People on bail?

15:48.515 --> 15:49.749
(Barba)
Remand, your Honor.

15:49.782 --> 15:51.184
The State has a strong case,

15:51.218 --> 15:52.419
as the defendant
even filmed the murder.

15:52.452 --> 15:53.420
He has every reason
to flee.

15:53.453 --> 15:54.654
He called 911.

15:54.687 --> 15:56.123
The deceased confessed

15:56.156 --> 15:57.490
to raping
my client's daughter.

15:57.524 --> 15:59.126
He wasn't murdered.

15:59.159 --> 16:00.760
He died from
asthma complications.

16:00.793 --> 16:02.195
He tortured Jerome!

16:02.229 --> 16:03.363
(Judge)
Order!

16:03.396 --> 16:04.464
One more outburst,

16:04.497 --> 16:05.498
I'm gonna clear the gallery.

16:05.532 --> 16:07.167
Please proceed,
Mr. Desappio.

16:07.200 --> 16:08.635
We request R.O.R.

16:08.668 --> 16:11.171
Mr. Davis has strong ties
to the community,

16:11.204 --> 16:13.106
his family,
and his church.

16:13.140 --> 16:14.774
He's a decorated veteran.

16:14.807 --> 16:17.510
Notwithstanding the accused's
service to our country,

16:17.544 --> 16:20.647
this court cannot
condone vigilantism.

16:20.680 --> 16:22.115
Bail is set at $1 million.

16:22.149 --> 16:23.483
- Yes.
- Yes.

16:23.516 --> 16:25.518
$1 million?
That's punitive--your Honor--

16:25.552 --> 16:27.554
Defendant is remanded to Rikers
until bond is posted.

16:27.587 --> 16:28.421
[gavel bangs]

16:28.455 --> 16:30.557
[courtroom murmurs]

16:30.590 --> 16:32.459
Dad.

16:32.492 --> 16:33.493
Dad, I'm so sorry.

16:33.526 --> 16:35.195
Jenna, we have to go.

16:35.228 --> 16:36.463
We're gonna get
you out of there

16:36.496 --> 16:37.464
as soon as we can, okay?

16:37.497 --> 16:38.465
(Jenna)
I'm sorry.

16:38.498 --> 16:39.532
Give us a little time.

16:44.071 --> 16:45.538
That went well.

16:45.572 --> 16:47.340
For who?

16:47.374 --> 16:51.578
The NYPD framed my son
for this rape

16:51.611 --> 16:53.413
just like they did
the last time.

16:53.446 --> 16:56.449
Then they set him up
to be killed.

16:56.483 --> 16:58.118
That girl.

16:58.151 --> 16:59.552
She's lying.

16:59.586 --> 17:01.054
She's a liar.

17:01.088 --> 17:02.422
You killed him!

17:02.455 --> 17:03.556
You killed my son.

17:04.791 --> 17:07.194
- She killed him.
- Sergeant.

17:07.227 --> 17:08.528
- Bad news.
- What?

17:08.561 --> 17:10.530
(Carisi)
TARU rescued
the security footage

17:10.563 --> 17:12.232
from the pizza joint.

17:12.265 --> 17:14.834
Jerome was in that bathroom
for less than two minutes.

17:14.867 --> 17:18.538
Okay, let's take this
away from here.

17:18.571 --> 17:20.240
(Carisi)
She enters the bathroom
at 6:22.

17:20.273 --> 17:21.641
She's in there for about
eight minutes.

17:21.674 --> 17:23.410
Meanwhile, a line forms.

17:23.443 --> 17:25.545
Jerome gets there,
he knocks.

17:25.578 --> 17:27.280
He goes in at 6:30.

17:27.314 --> 17:30.850
He's in there for
less than 90 seconds.

17:30.883 --> 17:32.285
With the bathroom door ajar.

17:32.319 --> 17:33.486
Yeah, and there's a line
of people

17:33.520 --> 17:34.721
standing outside.

17:34.754 --> 17:37.090
And look,
Jenna comes out.

17:37.124 --> 17:39.092
Jerome follows her
with her purse.

17:39.126 --> 17:42.129
She comes out first,
fully dressed, jacket on,

17:42.162 --> 17:43.596
with her tights still on.

17:43.630 --> 17:46.099
Yeah, and he's--
he's fully clothed too.

17:46.133 --> 17:47.334
The DNA on the sweater?

17:47.367 --> 17:48.468
(Carisi)
Still waiting on that.

17:48.501 --> 17:49.569
But all due respect,
counselor,

17:49.602 --> 17:50.703
you're grasping
at straws.

17:50.737 --> 17:52.239
This guy didn't have
enough time.

17:52.272 --> 17:53.506
The door was open.

17:55.742 --> 17:57.410
Luke killed
an innocent kid.

17:57.444 --> 17:58.778
Look, she could've been
assaulted first

17:58.811 --> 18:00.580
and then
conflated things.

18:00.613 --> 18:03.183
Or she's a 16-year-old girl
who got drunk.

18:03.216 --> 18:04.484
She had sex.

18:04.517 --> 18:05.652
She was afraid
to tell her parents,

18:05.685 --> 18:06.753
so she cried rape.

18:06.786 --> 18:08.288
So keep vetting her,
her friends,

18:08.321 --> 18:09.589
any boyfriends.

18:09.622 --> 18:11.191
Recheck texts,
social media.

18:11.224 --> 18:13.326
Find out where she got
that Clonazepam.

18:13.360 --> 18:14.461
And don't bring her
back in here

18:14.494 --> 18:15.795
until we've filled in
the gaps.

18:19.399 --> 18:21.601
Luke, the police are saying
that man isn't guilty.

18:21.634 --> 18:23.503
I know, but Neil's saying
it's just politics

18:23.536 --> 18:26.439
because of that guy's
lawsuit against the city.

18:26.473 --> 18:28.641
I mean, he's the one
that did this to you, right?

18:32.912 --> 18:34.113
Jenna.

18:38.485 --> 18:40.920
Even if I'm not sure,
it's better for you

18:40.953 --> 18:43.790
if I just say
that it was him, right?

18:46.393 --> 18:48.728
(Jenna on recording)
Even if I'm not sure,
it's better for you

18:48.761 --> 18:50.663
if I just say
that it was him.

18:50.697 --> 18:52.565
Wait, wait, what?
You recorded us?

18:52.599 --> 18:53.933
(Amaro)
You need to tell us

18:53.966 --> 18:55.468
what you meant by that.

18:55.502 --> 18:56.503
Jenna.

18:56.536 --> 18:58.571
No.

18:58.605 --> 19:01.408
No, I'm not gonna do anything
to hurt my dad.

19:01.441 --> 19:02.542
(Rollins)
Okay, but honey,

19:02.575 --> 19:05.245
we know that it
wasn't Jerome.

19:05.278 --> 19:10.550
But we do believe that
you were assaulted, okay?

19:10.583 --> 19:13.553
Is there something
you haven't told us?

19:17.624 --> 19:19.326
How you holding up,
Miss Davis?

19:19.359 --> 19:21.628
I'd be more comfortable
in the room with Jenna.

19:21.661 --> 19:22.862
Why can't I go in?

19:22.895 --> 19:24.331
You can,

19:24.364 --> 19:25.498
but she might be
more open this way.

19:25.532 --> 19:27.600
Yeah, when my sisters
were younger,

19:27.634 --> 19:30.403
they used to tell me stuff that
they would never tell my mom.

19:33.740 --> 19:35.575
No, I don't have a boyfriend.

19:35.608 --> 19:38.378
I wasn't hooking up
at Kara's.

19:38.411 --> 19:40.613
Did you drink something
there, maybe?

19:43.783 --> 19:46.219
I had a couple sips
from a vodka bottle,

19:46.253 --> 19:48.455
but no pills or drugs
or anything, I swear.

19:48.488 --> 19:50.690
Okay, and what about
after Kara's apartment?

19:52.425 --> 19:53.893
That's where it all
starts to fade.

19:53.926 --> 19:59.532
Well, we know you walked down
First Ave from traffic cameras.

19:59.566 --> 20:02.502
And you told us you remember
going into Stars Pizza.

20:02.535 --> 20:06.673
Yes, and I remember going into
the bathroom too.

20:06.706 --> 20:08.541
Okay.

20:08.575 --> 20:09.342
Then when you were attacked,

20:09.376 --> 20:11.378
were you standing up
or laying down?

20:18.050 --> 20:19.386
I was sitting.

20:21.321 --> 20:22.622
Can you show us?

20:33.466 --> 20:35.302
I remember sliding down.

20:36.569 --> 20:38.338
Okay, that's good.

20:38.371 --> 20:40.340
And your head was
leaned back like that?

20:40.373 --> 20:41.408
Yeah.

20:41.441 --> 20:42.675
Your hands,
they were gripping?

20:42.709 --> 20:46.346
Yeah, I think I was holding onto
the armrests.

20:46.379 --> 20:50.317
Well, how about any sounds
or smells?

20:52.352 --> 20:55.655
Music, maybe.

20:55.688 --> 20:57.924
No, um...

20:57.957 --> 21:04.631
His belt buckle clinked
over and over.

21:04.664 --> 21:05.898
All right, good.

21:05.932 --> 21:07.500
Is there anything else?

21:12.972 --> 21:17.310
He pulled up my sweater.

21:17.344 --> 21:19.512
Then I couldn't move.

21:19.546 --> 21:22.749
His hands were so--
so cold.

21:22.782 --> 21:26.753
Do you remember, was he wearing
a watch or any jewelry?

21:32.525 --> 21:33.926
A ring.

21:33.960 --> 21:38.731
He was wearing
a big ring like--

21:38.765 --> 21:41.668
No, please don't tell my mom.
She's already a mess.

21:41.701 --> 21:43.536
Please don't tell her,
please.

21:43.570 --> 21:44.871
Just tell us,
all right?

21:44.904 --> 21:46.473
A ring like what?

21:50.577 --> 21:53.413
A ring like
my Uncle Neil wears.

21:55.047 --> 21:56.749
I think it was him.

21:56.783 --> 21:58.751
You think,
or you know?

22:04.591 --> 22:06.025
It was him.

22:08.094 --> 22:11.631
My uncle Neil,
he raped me.

22:16.569 --> 22:19.506
Her own uncle?

22:19.539 --> 22:21.107
No, that--
that can't be.

22:34.421 --> 22:34.554
.

22:34.587 --> 22:35.154
Hold up,
Jenna is accusing

22:35.988 --> 22:37.990
her uncle, the dentist,
of raping her?

22:38.024 --> 22:40.527
Yeah, it was a pretty
tough disclosure.

22:40.560 --> 22:42.094
Her memory came back
in pieces.

22:42.128 --> 22:43.129
She didn't want to
believe it.

22:43.162 --> 22:44.564
I don't want to either.

22:44.597 --> 22:45.798
Aside from consulting
for us,

22:45.832 --> 22:47.033
he's big on
the charity circuit,

22:47.066 --> 22:48.968
sets up dental clinics
in third world countries.

22:49.001 --> 22:50.970
Not to mention
that he's testified

22:51.003 --> 22:51.971
in dozens of cases.

22:52.004 --> 22:53.440
If he's a rapist,

22:53.473 --> 22:55.107
all those convictions
come back into question.

22:55.141 --> 22:57.076
Yeah,
not to mention that.

22:57.109 --> 22:59.679
(Benson)
Jenna has no motive to lie.

22:59.712 --> 23:01.481
I mean, sticking to
the Jerome story

23:01.514 --> 23:02.749
just helps her father.

23:02.782 --> 23:04.417
She remembers his ring.

23:04.451 --> 23:06.085
And the other details match
a dentist's office,

23:06.118 --> 23:07.520
including the Clonazepam.

23:07.554 --> 23:09.121
This is why I don't
trust dentists.

23:10.156 --> 23:11.591
So what now?

23:11.624 --> 23:12.992
The DNA on the sweater.

23:13.025 --> 23:14.794
Find out why that's
taking so long.

23:14.827 --> 23:16.996
They should at least know
if it's a familial match by now.

23:17.029 --> 23:18.130
Well, good luck
getting a sample

23:18.164 --> 23:19.866
from Dr. Alexander
without a warrant.

23:19.899 --> 23:21.634
Once she tells her mother,
mother tells him--

23:21.668 --> 23:23.002
Hold them both here
a while longer.

23:23.035 --> 23:24.637
Have them look at mug shots,
anything.

23:24.671 --> 23:26.005
Find a pretext.

23:26.038 --> 23:28.107
Amaro, Carisi,
buddy up to Dr. Alexander.

23:28.140 --> 23:30.142
Let him know that
you're on Luke's side,

23:30.176 --> 23:32.011
and get his DNA.

23:36.916 --> 23:38.885
(Neil)
Come on, I know what's going on.

23:38.918 --> 23:40.887
They've ordered you guys
to exonerate Jerome.

23:40.920 --> 23:42.154
Well, you know,
1PP, right?

23:42.188 --> 23:44.023
That extra P's
for politics.

23:44.056 --> 23:45.592
Which is why
we want to make sure

23:45.625 --> 23:48.027
the blame's placed
where it belongs, on Jerome.

23:50.096 --> 23:52.932
Okay, how can I help?

23:52.965 --> 23:57.036
There's DNA under Jenna's
fingernails that we can't match.

23:57.069 --> 23:59.572
We're just trying to rule out
friends, family.

23:59.606 --> 24:01.040
Pretty much anyone
who coughed, sneezed,

24:01.073 --> 24:02.875
or so much as left a hair
on Jenna that day.

24:02.909 --> 24:04.076
And once they're cleared,

24:04.110 --> 24:05.845
everyone will know
it was Jerome.

24:05.878 --> 24:07.814
And since Jenna was in my office
that afternoon...

24:07.847 --> 24:09.048
(Amaro)
Exactly.

24:09.081 --> 24:09.982
We'll need a sample
from anyone

24:10.016 --> 24:11.718
who was in the office
while Jenna was here--

24:11.751 --> 24:13.052
patients, hygienists,
delivery men.

24:13.085 --> 24:14.887
We'll need one from you, too,
of course.

24:14.921 --> 24:15.888
Of course.

24:15.922 --> 24:17.557
[knocks on door]

24:17.590 --> 24:19.258
Neil, Kerry in Exam 3
has been under a few minutes.

24:19.291 --> 24:20.493
Sorry to interrupt.

24:20.527 --> 24:22.228
No, no, come in,
sweetie.

24:22.261 --> 24:24.864
Detectives, this is
my hygienist, Jiya.

24:24.897 --> 24:27.667
She also happens to be
my wife.

24:27.700 --> 24:29.068
I'm gonna attend
to this patient.

24:29.101 --> 24:31.504
Jiya, can you get the detectives
the patient list

24:31.538 --> 24:33.205
from the day Jenna
was in the office?

24:33.239 --> 24:34.574
Right away.

24:34.607 --> 24:35.942
Hey, Doc, before you go,
though,

24:35.975 --> 24:37.176
we really need you to--

24:37.209 --> 24:38.778
Oh, yeah,
my swab, sure.

24:40.112 --> 24:42.114
Uh-huh.

24:42.148 --> 24:43.115
- All good?
- Yeah.

24:43.149 --> 24:44.116
Perfect.

24:44.150 --> 24:46.919
If you'll excuse me.

24:46.953 --> 24:48.187
Let me get you
that list.

24:51.924 --> 24:55.227
Jenna's such a tragedy.

24:55.261 --> 24:56.629
Luke too.

24:56.663 --> 24:57.830
Well, how did Jenna seem

24:57.864 --> 24:59.966
when she left the office
that day?

24:59.999 --> 25:01.801
She was fine.

25:01.834 --> 25:03.035
A little quiet.
Why?

25:03.069 --> 25:04.203
(Carisi)
Well, after she left,

25:04.236 --> 25:05.905
she was--
she was out of it.

25:05.938 --> 25:07.173
This is a dentist's office,

25:07.206 --> 25:08.941
so you guys have
anti-anxiety drugs, right?

25:08.975 --> 25:10.276
Yes, but we keep
the bottles locked up.

25:10.309 --> 25:11.944
Bottles, yeah.

25:11.978 --> 25:13.913
But would you ever leave
pills out in an exam room,

25:13.946 --> 25:15.815
like when you're
prepping a patient?

25:15.848 --> 25:18.751
Oh, my gosh,
it's possible.

25:18.785 --> 25:20.086
I've known Jenna since
she was a child,

25:20.119 --> 25:22.689
but she's a teenager now.

25:26.158 --> 25:28.160
Wife was quick to throw
Jenna under the bus.

25:28.194 --> 25:29.228
Implied she stole
the meds.

25:29.261 --> 25:30.296
Yeah, right?

25:30.329 --> 25:32.098
She's protecting
her husband.

25:32.131 --> 25:33.199
She knows what's coming.

25:35.234 --> 25:39.171
He raped his niece while his
hygienist guarded the door?

25:39.205 --> 25:40.807
The hygienist
is also his wife.

25:40.840 --> 25:42.041
Yeah,
it's a small office.

25:42.074 --> 25:43.743
Receptionist out front.

25:43.776 --> 25:46.679
She's the only one
in the back rooms.

25:46.713 --> 25:49.849
Okay, so working theory.

25:49.882 --> 25:54.020
Jiya gives Jenna the Clonazepam
in the dentist chair,

25:54.053 --> 25:55.888
then the nitrous.

25:55.922 --> 25:57.757
She's so out of it

25:57.790 --> 25:59.291
that she couldn't even process
that she'd been raped.

25:59.325 --> 26:01.193
But she was
in pain afterwards,

26:01.227 --> 26:04.864
so she does a few shots of vodka
at her friend's house.

26:04.897 --> 26:06.232
(Rollins)
And that mixes with the meds.

26:06.265 --> 26:07.867
She starts to lose it
on her way home.

26:07.900 --> 26:09.602
She staggers to the bathroom
of Stars Pizza.

26:09.636 --> 26:10.870
Jerome walks in,
she panics.

26:10.903 --> 26:11.938
[cell phone beeps]

26:11.971 --> 26:13.172
(Benson)
She's in denial

26:13.205 --> 26:16.075
about being raped
by her uncle,

26:16.108 --> 26:18.077
and she puts the whole thing
on Jerome.

26:18.110 --> 26:21.113
Your working theory
just became fact.

26:21.147 --> 26:23.650
The dentist's DNA
matches the semen

26:23.683 --> 26:25.251
found on Jenna's sweater.

26:29.922 --> 26:31.190
Hey, thanks
for coming in.

26:31.223 --> 26:32.191
We'll get right to it.

26:32.224 --> 26:33.225
You're here because the DNA

26:33.259 --> 26:34.694
found on Jenna's sweater

26:34.727 --> 26:36.128
is a match to yours.

26:36.162 --> 26:38.130
Well, she was in the office,
and I was treating her.

26:38.164 --> 26:39.398
So of course my DNA
is on her.

26:39.431 --> 26:41.300
Well, the DNA we found
was semen.

26:44.036 --> 26:45.204
[sighs]

26:45.237 --> 26:47.073
I was afraid of this.

26:47.106 --> 26:48.374
I can explain, but...

26:48.407 --> 26:50.109
it gets a little awkward.

26:50.142 --> 26:51.911
There's a reason
for that match.

26:51.944 --> 26:53.245
Well, we figured
there had to be.

26:53.279 --> 26:55.381
But it's got to stay
in this room.

26:55.414 --> 26:58.951
My wife and I had
a few minutes of downtime

26:58.985 --> 27:00.219
before Jenna came in,

27:00.252 --> 27:04.924
and we sent the receptionist
out for some coffees.

27:04.957 --> 27:07.093
We had a little quickie
in the chair.

27:08.460 --> 27:10.129
Look, it's nothing
I want my patients

27:10.162 --> 27:11.397
to read about,
obviously.

27:11.430 --> 27:12.832
No, of course not.

27:12.865 --> 27:13.833
- Okay.
- Of course not.

27:13.866 --> 27:15.234
The problem is,

27:15.267 --> 27:19.205
your niece is coming around
to saying you raped her.

27:20.206 --> 27:21.173
- What?
- Yeah.

27:23.175 --> 27:25.111
That's impossible
and horrifying.

27:25.144 --> 27:26.312
You didn't know?

27:26.345 --> 27:27.814
Your sister
didn't tell you?

27:27.847 --> 27:29.248
First of all,
I would never touch my niece

27:29.281 --> 27:30.750
or any patient,
for that matter.

27:30.783 --> 27:32.118
Well, she was sedated,

27:32.151 --> 27:35.354
but she wasn't
unconscious, so...

27:35.387 --> 27:37.790
you saying she's lying?

27:39.726 --> 27:41.193
Nitrous can cause
hallucinations.

27:41.227 --> 27:43.696
Jiya said she might have helped
herself to some Clonazepam.

27:43.730 --> 27:44.997
There was alcohol
in her system.

27:45.031 --> 27:46.432
All these things
exacerbate confusion.

27:46.465 --> 27:48.000
Yeah, we get all that.

27:48.034 --> 27:49.802
But is there anything
you might have done?

27:49.836 --> 27:52.138
An accidental touch
while you were

27:52.171 --> 27:53.372
working very closely on her

27:53.405 --> 27:55.307
that she may have
misinterpreted.

27:55.341 --> 27:57.209
- No!
- Oh.

27:57.243 --> 27:59.712
Whatever Jenna said
is fantasy.

27:59.746 --> 28:01.180
I mean, you guys think
Jerome Jones

28:01.213 --> 28:03.449
is a lawsuit waiting to happen,
keep this up.

28:03.482 --> 28:04.884
You'll all be getting deposed.

28:04.917 --> 28:06.152
Anything else?

28:06.185 --> 28:07.386
I have a practice to run.

28:17.129 --> 28:19.031
I mean, he's right.
The drugs, the booze--

28:19.065 --> 28:20.800
there's a lot for his lawyer
to work with.

28:20.833 --> 28:22.501
If this guy really did
rape his niece

28:22.534 --> 28:24.203
while his wife was
in the office...

28:24.236 --> 28:26.238
Then this isn't
his first time.

28:27.239 --> 28:28.975
Full court press.

28:29.008 --> 28:31.077
The next time Dr. Alexander
comes through those doors,

28:31.110 --> 28:33.145
he's gonna be wearing cuffs.

28:35.414 --> 28:38.084
Tell me
you found something.

28:38.117 --> 28:39.952
Testimonials, awards,

28:39.986 --> 28:42.088
a couple of bad reviews
on Yelp.

28:42.121 --> 28:43.055
That's it?

28:43.089 --> 28:44.356
I found a lawsuit

28:44.390 --> 28:45.992
that was filed, like,
five years ago.

28:46.025 --> 28:47.193
The records are sealed,

28:47.226 --> 28:48.460
but I tried to speak
with the attorney.

28:48.494 --> 28:50.196
Obviously,
she couldn't talk,

28:50.229 --> 28:52.064
but hypothetically,
it wasn't about bad dentistry.

28:52.098 --> 28:53.265
Can we talk to the patient?

28:53.299 --> 28:55.768
No, I mean, that was
part of the settlement.

28:55.802 --> 28:57.236
I don't know,
I can try and see

28:57.269 --> 28:59.471
if Barba can work around
the confidentiality agreement.

28:59.505 --> 29:01.107
I'll call him.

29:01.140 --> 29:02.341
Keep digging, guys.

29:02.374 --> 29:04.777
There's got to be
others out there.

29:04.811 --> 29:06.979
Sergeant Benson.

29:07.013 --> 29:09.215
(Benson)
Mrs. Davis. Jenna.

29:09.248 --> 29:11.150
Is everything all right?

29:11.183 --> 29:13.319
Jenna needs to
tell you something.

29:17.423 --> 29:20.292
I shouldn't have said it was
Uncle Neil who did this.

29:20.326 --> 29:23.362
Hold on...you shouldn't
have said it,

29:23.395 --> 29:24.530
but he did assault you.

29:24.563 --> 29:27.099
My brother
would never.

29:27.133 --> 29:29.268
Tell them what
the therapist said.

29:29.301 --> 29:30.970
That I was confused.

29:31.003 --> 29:33.405
The therapist said that trauma
and drugs and alcohol

29:33.439 --> 29:35.107
can really mess with
short-term memory.

29:35.141 --> 29:36.375
- You went to a therapist.
(Marcy) Yes.

29:36.408 --> 29:37.977
And she told Jenna that

29:38.010 --> 29:39.178
what happened to her
made her suggestible.

29:39.211 --> 29:40.546
And when I left her
alone with you,

29:40.579 --> 29:41.447
you planted that idea.

29:41.480 --> 29:43.883
That is not
what happened, Mrs. Davis.

29:43.916 --> 29:45.852
No? Have you even heard
of false memory syndrome?

29:45.885 --> 29:47.186
Of course we have.

29:47.219 --> 29:49.989
But something this traumatic
takes time to process.

29:50.022 --> 29:52.825
Bits and pieces
come back slowly.

29:52.859 --> 29:53.926
You're framing Neil,

29:53.960 --> 29:55.194
and you're using my daughter
to do it.

29:55.227 --> 29:56.528
Is that what he told you?

29:56.562 --> 29:58.264
May I ask who referred you
to this therapist?

29:58.297 --> 30:00.099
- Was it your brother?
- Don't twist this.

30:00.132 --> 30:02.534
Mrs. Davis, I know
this is difficult.

30:02.568 --> 30:04.070
There is DNA evidence.

30:04.103 --> 30:06.072
Your brother's semen
was on Jenna's sweater.

30:06.105 --> 30:07.306
He told me how it
got there.

30:07.339 --> 30:09.942
Did he tell you how it
got inside of her sweater?

30:09.976 --> 30:11.310
We're not listening
anymore.

30:11.343 --> 30:13.112
Jenna, tell them what
you said was a lie.

30:13.145 --> 30:15.314
I-I'm not accusing my uncle.

30:15.347 --> 30:19.151
He would never
do that to me.

30:22.421 --> 30:23.622
Well, there goes that case.

30:23.655 --> 30:25.157
Not so fast,
Counselor.

30:25.191 --> 30:26.292
We know what happened.

30:26.325 --> 30:28.394
The mother's obviously
pressuring her.

30:28.427 --> 30:30.062
Any other vics come forward?

30:30.096 --> 30:31.964
No, we just found
the one lawsuit so far.

30:31.998 --> 30:34.000
Get us a subpoena for
his patient records.

30:34.033 --> 30:35.902
We'll start talking to everyone
he's worked on.

30:35.935 --> 30:37.236
No, we do that,
it's gonna play

30:37.269 --> 30:39.005
right into his claim
that NYPD has an agenda.

30:39.038 --> 30:42.208
Hey, we could let the patients
come to us.

30:42.241 --> 30:44.911
Liv, you still friends
with that reporter, Jimmy Mac?

30:44.944 --> 30:47.980
We keep in touch.

30:48.014 --> 30:49.481
I do owe him a drink.

30:49.515 --> 30:51.918
Do not leak this
to the press.

30:51.951 --> 30:54.153
We all know that there are
more victims out there.

30:54.186 --> 30:56.155
Each one of them thinks
that they're the only one.

30:56.188 --> 30:58.190
Nobody will believe them.

30:58.224 --> 31:00.359
As soon as they find out
that it happened to others,

31:00.392 --> 31:01.627
they'll come forward.

31:01.660 --> 31:03.896
Throw a rock,
watch the ripples.

31:15.975 --> 31:16.108
.

31:16.142 --> 31:17.176
(Neil)
I was sickened
by this morning's headline.

31:18.410 --> 31:19.678
I've been a dentist
for 20 years

31:19.711 --> 31:21.447
without an accusation ever being
made against me.

31:21.480 --> 31:23.182
Except the ones
you paid off.

31:23.215 --> 31:24.583
(Neil)
I chair a peer-review panel.

31:24.616 --> 31:26.285
I consult with NYPD.

31:26.318 --> 31:28.620
I run clinics for
underprivileged youth

31:28.654 --> 31:30.256
both here and abroad.

31:30.289 --> 31:33.592
I would never harm a patient.

31:33.625 --> 31:35.127
His wife's standing there
by his side.

31:35.161 --> 31:36.128
What's she gonna do?

31:36.162 --> 31:37.129
He's her whole life.

31:37.163 --> 31:38.630
She looks drugged.

31:38.664 --> 31:40.332
Bet he does her high too.

31:40.366 --> 31:43.002
Textbook somnophiliac.

31:43.035 --> 31:44.270
Sleeping Beauty syndrome.

31:44.303 --> 31:46.172
This guy gets off
on passed out vics.

31:46.205 --> 31:48.107
What the hell's
the point of that?

31:48.140 --> 31:49.308
They don't talk back.

31:49.341 --> 31:50.977
Ugh.

31:51.010 --> 31:52.611
(Neil)
For standing by me
during this ordeal.

31:52.644 --> 31:55.614
(woman)
This is an obvious ploy
by the NYPD

31:55.647 --> 31:57.649
to distract the public
from the fact

31:57.683 --> 31:59.585
that they had the rapist
in custody,

31:59.618 --> 32:01.420
released him upon
political pressure.

32:01.453 --> 32:03.555
- Mute that witch!
- And failed to protect him.

32:03.589 --> 32:05.424
"Demon Dentist Rapes Niece."

32:05.457 --> 32:07.126
Although Jimmy Mac swore he'd
leave the vic out of it.

32:07.159 --> 32:08.427
And you believed him?

32:08.460 --> 32:10.329
He's a reporter.

32:10.362 --> 32:11.630
(woman on TV)
We ask for privacy.

32:11.663 --> 32:12.698
(Rollins)
Okay, please hold.

32:12.731 --> 32:13.966
Hey, Sergeant.

32:14.000 --> 32:15.401
Either way,
the ploy worked.

32:15.434 --> 32:16.602
The phones have been
ringing.

32:16.635 --> 32:18.670
This is the fifth call
since we got back.

32:18.704 --> 32:20.439
This one says Dr. Neil
drugged and raped her

32:20.472 --> 32:21.673
back in dental school.

32:21.707 --> 32:23.509
Okay, bring all of them
in here now.

32:23.542 --> 32:24.610
[background chatter]

32:24.643 --> 32:26.745
We got to wipe that smile

32:26.778 --> 32:29.681
off that son of a bitch's face.

32:33.152 --> 32:35.121
I woke up.

32:35.154 --> 32:37.356
My clothes were on wrong.

32:37.389 --> 32:39.091
A button was off.

32:39.125 --> 32:41.227
You remember any details?

32:41.260 --> 32:42.728
A sound?

32:42.761 --> 32:45.664
I remember feeling
the cold edge of his ring

32:45.697 --> 32:49.535
as he slid his hands
under my bra.

32:49.568 --> 32:51.370
How old were you
when this happened?

32:51.403 --> 32:54.473
I was a freshman
in college.

32:54.506 --> 32:57.409
My--my roommate's mother
gave me his name.

32:59.378 --> 33:01.747
And he gave you a pill
for anxiety?

33:01.780 --> 33:03.382
No.

33:03.415 --> 33:05.051
He drugged me.

33:05.084 --> 33:07.619
I couldn't move.

33:07.653 --> 33:10.256
And he was a friend
of your father's.

33:10.289 --> 33:12.091
And my mom's.

33:12.124 --> 33:14.460
They still see him.

33:14.493 --> 33:18.197
I told my little sister
he's a perv.

33:18.230 --> 33:21.500
So far, 11 victims
have come forward.

33:21.533 --> 33:24.170
All remember being raped
or fondled

33:24.203 --> 33:25.504
by Dr. Alexander

33:25.537 --> 33:27.673
under sedation
in the past 20 years.

33:27.706 --> 33:29.208
Some of them even continued

33:29.241 --> 33:31.710
to see him as
a patient afterwards.

33:31.743 --> 33:34.580
I can try to prosecute,
but no corroborating evidence,

33:34.613 --> 33:35.714
no outcry at the time.

33:35.747 --> 33:37.716
You told me to find
more victims.

33:37.749 --> 33:39.318
I did.
You have.

33:39.351 --> 33:40.752
But these are all
tough cases,

33:40.786 --> 33:41.753
tough to prove,

33:41.787 --> 33:43.455
and if Jenna and Marcy

33:43.489 --> 33:44.490
aren't willing to testify,

33:44.523 --> 33:45.724
my hands are tied.

33:46.792 --> 33:48.627
So we'll talk to the father.

33:51.830 --> 33:53.432
(Luke)
No, no.

33:53.465 --> 33:54.633
My wife and I
talked about this already.

33:54.666 --> 33:55.667
Jenna was just confused.

33:55.701 --> 33:56.668
It's just--

33:56.702 --> 33:57.703
that's not possible.

33:57.736 --> 33:59.705
I mean,
Neil's her uncle.

33:59.738 --> 34:01.073
I mean, he paid
for my lawyer.

34:01.107 --> 34:02.308
He stood by me
the whole time.

34:02.341 --> 34:04.776
Stood by you
or set you up?

34:04.810 --> 34:07.546
He made sure that you knew
Jerome was a suspect,

34:07.579 --> 34:09.581
got you all riled up,
right?

34:09.615 --> 34:13.619
(Fin)
Yeah, and he made sure Jenna
never talked to us by herself.

34:13.652 --> 34:15.487
No, he was just
looking after her.

34:15.521 --> 34:16.788
(Carisi)
Oh, really?

34:16.822 --> 34:18.790
Is that why he sent her
to his therapist,

34:18.824 --> 34:20.626
who convinced her,
convinced your wife,

34:20.659 --> 34:22.594
that she'd fantasized
the whole attack?

34:22.628 --> 34:24.430
He's known her
since she was born.

34:24.463 --> 34:26.732
She remembers the chair.

34:26.765 --> 34:28.800
She remembers his ring.

34:28.834 --> 34:31.703
You know your daughter's
a good girl.

34:31.737 --> 34:34.806
She has always
told you truth.

34:34.840 --> 34:36.208
(Fin)
Listen.

34:36.242 --> 34:38.844
We found his semen
on her sweater.

34:38.877 --> 34:41.747
Inside her sweater.

34:46.385 --> 34:47.819
I have to go.

34:49.688 --> 34:51.723
I have to
get out of here.

34:51.757 --> 34:52.724
I have to go.

34:52.758 --> 34:53.459
Sit down.

34:53.492 --> 34:55.127
You have to get me
out of here.

34:55.161 --> 34:56.362
I have to
take care of this.

34:56.395 --> 34:57.829
We're not gonna do that.

34:59.565 --> 35:02.668
We need you
to talk to your wife.

35:02.701 --> 35:04.703
Can you do that?

35:04.736 --> 35:07.139
Can you do that
for Jenna?

35:10.742 --> 35:15.514
(Marcy)
My husband's on suicide watch
at Rikers.

35:15.547 --> 35:18.250
He really thought Jerome
had raped Jenna.

35:19.385 --> 35:20.619
Do you still think that?

35:20.652 --> 35:23.622
No.

35:23.655 --> 35:26.192
I've had three friends
call me

35:26.225 --> 35:27.926
since that article.

35:27.959 --> 35:29.761
He groped two
of their daughters.

35:29.795 --> 35:31.663
The third,
he may have raped.

35:31.697 --> 35:33.399
I referred all of
them to him.

35:33.432 --> 35:34.766
Any of them willing
to talk to us?

35:34.800 --> 35:36.768
They won't put their girls
through this.

35:36.802 --> 35:38.470
What about Jenna?

35:38.504 --> 35:40.572
I don't want to put her
through this either.

35:40.606 --> 35:42.874
So Jerome Jones dies,

35:42.908 --> 35:45.611
your husband does hard time,

35:45.644 --> 35:47.379
and your brother the rapist
goes free.

35:47.413 --> 35:49.681
Hard time?

35:49.715 --> 35:51.650
Luke didn't know.
Jenna's his little girl.

35:51.683 --> 35:52.951
He just went crazy.

35:52.984 --> 35:55.321
I understand.

35:55.354 --> 35:58.790
I will talk to his lawyer
about a plea.

35:58.824 --> 36:00.726
But you need to
talk to Jenna.

36:00.759 --> 36:02.828
If she testifies,
he'll break her.

36:02.861 --> 36:04.463
Neil's too smart.

36:04.496 --> 36:06.232
You can't catch him.

36:06.265 --> 36:08.800
But your daughter can.

36:26.585 --> 36:27.819
There's the doctor.

36:27.853 --> 36:29.855
He's not smiling now.

36:42.268 --> 36:43.802
I hope there's a good reason
for this.

36:43.835 --> 36:45.271
I shouldn't even be here.

36:45.304 --> 36:46.772
(Jenna) I need to talk to you.
- Okay.

36:46.805 --> 36:48.374
(Jenna)
Dad's in jail.

36:48.407 --> 36:49.608
Mom's a mess.

36:49.641 --> 36:50.676
That Jerome guy is dead.

36:50.709 --> 36:51.910
I don't know
what to do.

36:51.943 --> 36:54.313
Jenna, first you accuse me
and now this article.

36:54.346 --> 36:55.781
You have ruined my life.

36:55.814 --> 36:57.849
You ruined my life.

36:57.883 --> 36:59.318
I know what you did to me.

36:59.351 --> 37:00.652
I didn't do anything to you.

37:00.686 --> 37:02.388
You were on drugs.

37:02.421 --> 37:04.456
The therapist said that
you're a teenage girl;

37:04.490 --> 37:05.824
you're very suggestible.

37:05.857 --> 37:07.659
He's not just
gonna admit it.

37:07.693 --> 37:08.694
- He's smart.
- So is she.

37:08.727 --> 37:10.329
(Jenna)
Then how did your semen

37:10.362 --> 37:12.398
get on the inside of my sweater,
Uncle Neil?

37:12.431 --> 37:13.399
How did that happen?

37:13.432 --> 37:15.701
You raped me.

37:15.734 --> 37:17.669
What am I doing here?
What do you want?

37:20.071 --> 37:22.641
I read in an article
that there have been lawsuits

37:22.674 --> 37:24.710
that you paid other
people to keep quiet.

37:26.312 --> 37:28.714
Well, I'm your uncle.
We're family.

37:28.747 --> 37:30.015
I will take care
of you and your mother

37:30.048 --> 37:31.383
while your
father's in prison.

37:31.417 --> 37:32.718
I will pay for
his legal bills,

37:32.751 --> 37:35.721
and you will stop
this nonsense.

37:37.423 --> 37:38.790
Is that understood?

37:41.627 --> 37:43.995
- Okay. Yeah.
- Okay.

37:44.029 --> 37:45.731
- Damn.
- Go on, Jenna. Tell him.

37:45.764 --> 37:46.765
(Jenna)
Wait, wait.

37:46.798 --> 37:48.033
- One more thing.
- Yeah?

37:48.066 --> 37:50.369
I'm late.
I think I might be pregnant.

37:50.402 --> 37:52.070
You're not pregnant, Jenna.

37:52.103 --> 37:54.005
No. I'm 16.
I can't have a baby now.

37:54.039 --> 37:55.374
Keep your voice down.

37:55.407 --> 37:56.408
Keep your voice--
sit down.

37:56.442 --> 37:57.809
Okay?

37:57.843 --> 37:58.677
You're not pregnant.

37:58.710 --> 38:00.679
That's impossible.

38:00.712 --> 38:03.315
I know that I'm pregnant.
I wake up sick every morning--

38:03.349 --> 38:04.716
[pounds table]
Stop your whining!

38:04.750 --> 38:06.318
I didn't get
you pregnant.

38:06.352 --> 38:07.886
I couldn't have.
I've had a vasectomy.

38:07.919 --> 38:09.455
Are we done here?

38:09.488 --> 38:10.722
Oh, yeah.
You're done now, pal.

38:10.756 --> 38:11.823
Let's go.

38:13.692 --> 38:15.794
So you did it.

38:15.827 --> 38:17.028
You admitted you raped me.

38:17.062 --> 38:18.096
It's not a big deal.

38:18.129 --> 38:20.999
You're not so special,
Jenna, okay?

38:21.032 --> 38:22.100
I was a virgin.

38:22.133 --> 38:23.101
Please.

38:23.134 --> 38:24.403
I was a virgin.

38:24.436 --> 38:25.737
Jeez--

38:25.771 --> 38:27.606
Know what?

38:27.639 --> 38:30.476
I've never met a bad man
that wasn't afraid of a baby.

38:30.509 --> 38:31.977
Works every time.

38:32.010 --> 38:33.479
Neil Alexander,
you're under arrest.

38:33.512 --> 38:34.546
Mm-hmm.
Yeah.

38:34.580 --> 38:35.847
I want my lawyer.

38:35.881 --> 38:38.083
- Jenna, are you okay?
- Yeah.

38:38.116 --> 38:40.085
You have the right
to remain silent.

38:47.993 --> 38:48.460
.

38:48.494 --> 38:48.694
Jenna?

38:49.528 --> 38:50.496
Are you okay?

38:50.529 --> 38:51.730
Mom.

38:51.763 --> 38:53.064
He said he did it.

38:53.098 --> 38:55.567
I'm sorry.

38:55.601 --> 38:57.536
Oh, God,
I'm so sorry.

38:58.937 --> 39:00.672
I'm sorry.

39:00.706 --> 39:03.975
Shh. It's okay.
It's okay.

39:04.009 --> 39:05.777
[Jenna crying]
It's okay.

39:05.811 --> 39:07.913
Shh, shh, shh.

39:07.946 --> 39:09.448
- You know you have nothing--
- Shut up.

39:09.481 --> 39:11.049
Right? It's clearly me
trying to calm down

39:11.082 --> 39:12.751
an obviously paranoid girl.

39:12.784 --> 39:14.119
So she's crazy?

39:14.152 --> 39:15.621
Just like the other
17 women who came forward?

39:17.055 --> 39:18.724
Hang on.
Hold on.

39:18.757 --> 39:20.559
You son of a bitch!

39:20.592 --> 39:21.893
- Take it easy.
- You son of a--

39:21.927 --> 39:23.895
My daughter?
How could you?

39:23.929 --> 39:26.765
Jenna has issues, Marcy.
She always has.

39:26.798 --> 39:28.467
I'm your sister!

39:28.500 --> 39:30.902
How could you do this to us?
To your own family?

39:30.936 --> 39:32.170
Listen to me.
Listen to me.

39:32.203 --> 39:34.406
This is not the time.
Okay?

39:34.440 --> 39:36.041
This is not the time.

39:36.074 --> 39:37.443
Mom.

39:38.777 --> 39:40.011
It's okay.

39:40.045 --> 39:42.080
It's okay.
Don't worry.

39:42.113 --> 39:43.415
It's okay.

39:46.818 --> 39:49.054
I should have let her
get her hands on you.

39:49.087 --> 39:50.589
You raped her daughter,

39:50.622 --> 39:52.090
ripped her heart out
with her husband going to jail

39:52.123 --> 39:53.859
for killing a guy
that should have been you.

39:53.892 --> 39:56.762
Okay, you're hurting me.
I'm a dentist. I need my hands.

39:56.795 --> 39:59.097
That's all you got to say?

39:59.130 --> 40:00.866
- That hurts?
- Ahh!

40:00.899 --> 40:02.100
What hurts more?

40:02.133 --> 40:04.169
This or what you
did to Jenna?

40:14.746 --> 40:17.683
Jerome's family
and her family...

40:17.716 --> 40:19.818
both destroyed.

40:19.851 --> 40:22.488
You tell me how either
one of them starts over.

40:30.128 --> 40:31.530
(Barba)
You were right.

40:31.563 --> 40:32.698
Jerome didn't assault Jenna.

40:32.731 --> 40:35.467
He was trying to help her.

40:35.501 --> 40:36.502
That's what we
said before.

40:36.535 --> 40:37.869
That's not news to us.

40:37.903 --> 40:40.539
The girl was
raped by her uncle.

40:40.572 --> 40:43.041
He knew her father,
Luke, had a temper.

40:43.074 --> 40:45.043
He worked him up
to kidnap Jerome.

40:45.076 --> 40:47.513
Luke murdered my son.

40:50.281 --> 40:51.617
Her uncle is under arrest.

40:51.650 --> 40:52.951
He is being brought in now.

40:52.984 --> 40:54.486
He will pay the price,

40:54.520 --> 40:57.856
but Luke Davis was not
trying to murder your son.

40:59.891 --> 41:02.127
We have footage of him
attempting CPR.

41:06.197 --> 41:08.934
He wanted justice
for his daughter.

41:08.967 --> 41:10.836
The way you want
justice for Jerome.

41:14.039 --> 41:15.841
What are you saying?

41:17.576 --> 41:19.244
If I take this to trial

41:19.277 --> 41:21.713
for felony murder,

41:21.747 --> 41:23.915
a jury may let Luke go.

41:26.284 --> 41:28.086
If he pleads to manslaughter,

41:28.119 --> 41:29.254
he will do time.

41:29.287 --> 41:30.989
How much?

41:33.158 --> 41:37.262
He gets a deal and my
innocent son is dead?

41:37.295 --> 41:39.765
Whose life matters to you?

41:45.070 --> 41:47.505
I'm so sorry for your loss.

41:50.341 --> 41:54.212
What happened
to Jerome was horrible.

41:54.245 --> 41:57.115
I wish I could
bring him back.

41:57.148 --> 42:00.118
But this is where we are.
