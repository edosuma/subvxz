00:05.381 --> 00:08.216
Death. He's gonna be there.

00:08.384 --> 00:10.756
I understand you want this.

00:10.928 --> 00:12.208
There are conditions.

00:12.388 --> 00:14.096
You know you can't cheat Death.

00:14.974 --> 00:17.844
I don't think it's killing people.
I think it's taking them.

00:18.018 --> 00:20.094
- When their time's just up.
- A Reaper.

00:20.271 --> 00:22.559
You're much prettier
than the last Reaper I met.

00:22.731 --> 00:25.057
- This is the Reaper that came after you.
- Dean.

00:25.234 --> 00:26.894
Tessa. Balthazar.

00:27.069 --> 00:30.272
- Why are you buying human souls?
- Any idea what souls are worth?

00:30.447 --> 00:31.479
What power they hold?

00:31.657 --> 00:34.658
Making sure you're not having second
thoughts about getting your soul back.

00:34.827 --> 00:38.492
Sam's soul has been locked in the cage...

00:38.664 --> 00:40.621
with Michael and Lucifer.

00:40.791 --> 00:44.326
If we try to force that mutilated thing
down Sam's gullet...

00:44.503 --> 00:46.994
- it could be catastrophic.
- He needs his soul.

00:47.172 --> 00:48.287
Look, we get it back...

00:48.465 --> 00:50.339
and if there are complications...

00:50.509 --> 00:53.178
then we will figure out a way
to deal with those too.

01:08.027 --> 01:09.651
It's so fresh here.

01:16.619 --> 01:18.196
Oh, you gotta be kidding me.

01:26.420 --> 01:28.247
Hi. I'm, uh looking for-

01:28.422 --> 01:29.797
Follow all the way back.

01:31.133 --> 01:32.841
All the way back.

01:54.073 --> 01:55.483
Dean Winchester?

01:58.535 --> 02:00.327
You must be Dr. Robert?

02:03.249 --> 02:04.447
Son.

02:04.625 --> 02:09.583
I stitched up your daddy more times
than I can count, let me tell you.

02:09.755 --> 02:12.211
Oh, it's good to see you.

02:12.383 --> 02:13.793
Of course, that was ages ago.

02:13.968 --> 02:16.589
Back when I still had
my medical license.

02:16.762 --> 02:17.877
Right this way.

02:20.057 --> 02:23.011
Well, you know,
I'm no germ freak, but, heh...

02:24.853 --> 02:26.645
Rent's cheap.

02:34.029 --> 02:36.651
- Eva, my assistant.
- Hi.

02:41.370 --> 02:45.996
- Hop right up.
- Now, you've, uh, done this a lot?

02:46.166 --> 02:47.542
Oh, many, many times.

02:47.710 --> 02:50.082
And your success rate?

02:50.254 --> 02:52.412
Oh, excellent. Almost 75 percent.

02:53.757 --> 02:57.292
So should we get the, uh, preliminaries
out of the way?

02:57.469 --> 02:58.750
Yeah. Yeah. Right.

02:59.889 --> 03:01.466
Ah.

03:03.058 --> 03:04.173
Ah.

03:05.269 --> 03:06.432
Uh...

03:07.146 --> 03:08.225
So...

03:09.148 --> 03:11.639
listen, if something...

03:12.151 --> 03:15.769
- Goes wrong?
- Yeah. Uh...

03:17.448 --> 03:19.487
Would you mail this for me?

03:19.658 --> 03:21.236
Sure.

03:21.410 --> 03:24.245
Would've thought you had something
for your brother Sam.

03:25.706 --> 03:27.864
If I don't make it back...

03:28.042 --> 03:30.959
nothing I say
is gonna mean a damn thing to him.

03:37.718 --> 03:39.129
Don't be a baby.

03:40.387 --> 03:43.222
A little bedside manner would be nice.

03:44.767 --> 03:45.929
Are we ready? Hmm?

03:54.485 --> 03:56.193
You've got three minutes.

04:12.586 --> 04:16.370
- No pulse, no sinus rhythm.
- He's dead.

04:25.766 --> 04:27.426
Good times.

04:36.610 --> 04:38.152
This better work.

04:42.449 --> 04:43.564
Dean?

04:43.742 --> 04:45.901
- What the hell?
- What do you know? It worked.

04:46.078 --> 04:49.162
I was in the Sudan.
What's with yanking me-?

04:49.331 --> 04:51.324
- Wait. Why are you dead?
- I need a favor.

04:51.500 --> 04:52.875
You died to ask me-?

04:53.043 --> 04:55.166
- Tell your boss I need to talk to him.
- No.

04:55.337 --> 04:57.413
- Please?
- Where do you get the nerve?

04:57.590 --> 04:58.669
Desperate times.

04:58.841 --> 05:00.880
He calls us. We don't call him.

05:01.051 --> 05:02.427
- Make an exception.
- I can't.

05:02.595 --> 05:03.875
- Can't or won't?
- Both.

05:04.054 --> 05:07.221
All right, Tessa. Thank you very much.

05:09.310 --> 05:10.804
Hello, Dean.

05:21.488 --> 05:24.442
I'm busy, Dean. Talk fast.
I have something of yours.

05:24.617 --> 05:28.910
You mean my ring?
I recall loaning you that temporarily.

05:29.079 --> 05:31.997
Well, if you want it back, then-
I'm sorry, you assume...

05:32.166 --> 05:34.491
that I don't know
where you've hidden it.

05:36.170 --> 05:39.669
Now we've established you have hubris
but no leverage.

05:40.591 --> 05:41.706
What is it you want?

05:45.512 --> 05:47.386
Lucifer's cage.

05:47.598 --> 05:50.931
I figure you're one of the few people
that can actually jailbreak it.

05:51.352 --> 05:52.762
Do you?

05:52.937 --> 05:55.428
- Sam's soul is stuck in that box.
- I've heard.

05:55.606 --> 05:58.227
Our other brother is trapped too.
Michael rode him in.

05:58.400 --> 06:01.152
Dean, quit shuffling and deal.

06:01.320 --> 06:03.858
I want you to get them both out.

06:04.323 --> 06:05.521
Hmm.

06:07.534 --> 06:09.112
Pick one.

06:11.247 --> 06:14.532
- What?
- Sam's soul or Adam's.

06:14.917 --> 06:18.001
- But-
- As a rule, I don't bring people back.

06:18.170 --> 06:20.957
I might make an exception.
Once. Not twice.

06:21.131 --> 06:24.335
- So pick.
- Sam.

06:26.095 --> 06:29.012
His soul has been in there for a year...

06:29.181 --> 06:32.135
and I understand that it's damaged.

06:32.309 --> 06:35.227
Try flayed to the raw nerve.

06:37.856 --> 06:40.312
Well, is there any way
that you could, uh...

06:40.484 --> 06:43.485
I don't know, hack the hell part off?

06:46.031 --> 06:48.902
<i>Four, three, two...</i>

06:49.076 --> 06:50.107
now.

06:54.623 --> 06:59.001
- Again.
- Dean, Dean, Dean.

06:59.169 --> 07:01.577
What do you think the soul is?

07:01.755 --> 07:03.713
Some pie you can slice?

07:03.883 --> 07:06.587
The soul can be bludgeoned,
tortured, but never broken.

07:06.760 --> 07:08.005
Not even by me.

07:08.178 --> 07:10.586
- Well, there's gotta be something.
- Maybe.

07:12.558 --> 07:14.218
Can't erase Sam's hell.

07:14.393 --> 07:18.343
But I can put it behind a wall,
if you will.

07:18.522 --> 07:20.645
- A wall?
- In his mind.

07:20.816 --> 07:22.690
A dam to hold back the tide.

07:23.319 --> 07:25.442
Nasty, those memories.

07:25.613 --> 07:29.112
You don't wanna know
what they'll do to him. Believe me.

07:31.785 --> 07:36.412
- Okay. A wall. Sounds good.
- But it's not permanent.

07:36.582 --> 07:39.618
She's right. Nothing lasts forever.

07:39.793 --> 07:41.418
Well, I do, but...

07:42.630 --> 07:43.709
So that's the choice:

07:43.881 --> 07:46.751
Sam with no soul,
or Sam with some drywall...

07:46.926 --> 07:51.006
that if or when it collapses,
he's done?

07:51.222 --> 07:52.301
Yeah.

07:52.681 --> 07:54.057
Do it.

07:56.268 --> 07:58.391
I never said I'd do it.

07:58.562 --> 08:03.473
- Then what have we been talking about?
- Your prize if you win the wager.

08:05.319 --> 08:08.735
Great. What's the bet?

08:10.491 --> 08:13.278
Don't roll your eyes, Dean.
It's impolite.

08:15.371 --> 08:18.574
Now, when you fetch my ring,
put it on.

08:19.500 --> 08:24.162
- What?
- I want you to be me for one day.

08:24.922 --> 08:26.464
Are you serious?

08:26.632 --> 08:29.088
No, I'm being incredibly sarcastic.

08:29.593 --> 08:31.385
Eva, adrenaline.

08:36.100 --> 08:40.097
Take the ring off before the 24 hours
are up, and you lose.

08:41.522 --> 08:43.145
No soul for Sam. Clear?

08:44.942 --> 08:47.018
Okay. Yes. But...

08:47.194 --> 08:49.863
- But why?
- Simple, Dean. Because-

08:51.407 --> 08:52.521
Oh, thank Moses.

08:52.741 --> 08:55.493
Ahh. You couldn't have given me
five more seconds?

08:55.661 --> 08:58.282
Son,
you were gone for seven minutes.

09:00.416 --> 09:02.289
- I was?
- Mm-hm.

09:02.459 --> 09:05.129
I thought for sure
Death had you by the twins.

09:08.340 --> 09:09.669
<i>You what? Hear me out.</i>

09:09.842 --> 09:10.956
I heard Cass and Crowley.

09:11.135 --> 09:13.424
They said it would kill me
or turn me to Jell-O.

09:13.596 --> 09:15.837
- I heard enough.
- Death can put up a wall.

09:16.015 --> 09:17.260
A wall? Yes, a wall.

09:17.433 --> 09:18.927
You wouldn't remember hell.

09:19.101 --> 09:20.560
- Really?
- Really.

09:20.728 --> 09:22.555
For good? Like a cure?

09:24.189 --> 09:25.933
No, it's not a cure. It-

09:26.108 --> 09:28.681
- He said it could last a lifetime.
- Great.

09:28.861 --> 09:30.818
Playing fast and loose
with my life here.

09:30.988 --> 09:34.072
- I'm trying to save your life.
- Exactly, Dean. It's my life.

09:34.575 --> 09:38.158
It's my life, it's my soul, and it ain't
your head that's gonna explode...

09:38.329 --> 09:41.033
when this whole scheme of yours
goes sideways.

09:42.625 --> 09:44.783
Just curious.

09:46.337 --> 09:50.286
I presume Death's not doing this
out of the goodness of his heart.

09:50.507 --> 09:52.714
So, what's your half of the deal?

09:56.013 --> 09:59.180
- I'm sorry, I didn't get that.
- I have to wear the ring for a day.

09:59.350 --> 10:01.223
Why would he want you to do that?

10:01.393 --> 10:04.098
Get his rocks off. I don't know.
But I'm doing it.

10:06.065 --> 10:07.725
Where are you going?

10:08.692 --> 10:10.602
Look, I hear you, all right? I get it.

10:11.362 --> 10:14.731
Just need a minute
to wrap my head around it, all right?

10:28.671 --> 10:30.663
Looking for this?

10:32.383 --> 10:33.462
Just taking a walk.

10:34.552 --> 10:36.176
Sam.

10:38.097 --> 10:39.970
I'm your brother.

10:40.516 --> 10:43.351
I'm not gonna let you get hurt.
I know what I'm doing here.

10:43.519 --> 10:46.010
- What if you're wrong?
- I won't let it go wrong.

10:50.484 --> 10:51.647
Fine.

10:52.194 --> 10:55.646
- Fine? So you're-?
- So I'm trusting you here.

10:55.823 --> 10:57.234
- Barely.
- You sure?

10:57.408 --> 10:59.281
You're the one with the compass, right?

10:59.493 --> 11:02.743
- Just don't mess it up.
- I won't.

11:09.753 --> 11:10.998
Watch him.

11:19.388 --> 11:23.433
So is this the part where you pull a gun
on me and lock me in the panic room?

11:24.143 --> 11:26.100
Do I have to?

11:27.479 --> 11:28.890
No.

11:29.273 --> 11:32.108
I guess Dean's gotta do
what he's gotta do.

11:32.651 --> 11:34.560
Guess we all do, kid.

11:42.286 --> 11:44.409
Well, here goes everything.

11:52.129 --> 11:53.244
Wow.

11:53.422 --> 11:55.830
Just let any slack-jawed haircut
be Death these days.

11:56.008 --> 11:57.668
You're all charm today, aren't you?

11:57.843 --> 11:58.922
Let's be clear...

11:59.094 --> 12:02.214
so that we get through this
with a minimum of screw-up.

12:02.389 --> 12:06.339
I don't like this, and right now,
I'm not crazy about you either.

12:06.769 --> 12:09.260
This is your boss's idea, not mine.

12:09.438 --> 12:12.854
True. But you have a long history
of throwing a wrench in everything...

12:13.025 --> 12:17.105
- so let's just stick to the rules, deal?
- And the rules are...?

12:17.279 --> 12:18.904
For the next 24 hours...

12:19.073 --> 12:21.908
- kill everyone who's up.
- How am I to know who to-?

12:22.076 --> 12:23.784
- Kill?
- I have a list.

12:23.953 --> 12:25.530
- Let me see.
- No.

12:25.704 --> 12:28.741
You touch them, they die, I reap them.

12:28.916 --> 12:31.407
- Are we clear?
- Yeah, I guess.

12:31.835 --> 12:33.994
Remove the ring, you lose.

12:34.171 --> 12:36.164
Slack off, you lose.

12:36.340 --> 12:38.416
- Got it?
- Yeah.

12:38.592 --> 12:39.968
Don't mess this up.

12:40.135 --> 12:42.757
It's not my job
to be your damn babysitter.

13:07.204 --> 13:10.288
Sam Winchester.

13:17.089 --> 13:18.334
This had better be good.

13:25.725 --> 13:28.217
Well, here's one
for the list of dumbest things ever.

13:28.395 --> 13:30.684
Summon the angel
who wants to kill you.

13:30.856 --> 13:32.729
Desperate times.

13:32.941 --> 13:36.275
- I need your help, Balthazar.
- Interesting.

13:36.445 --> 13:39.860
Since last time we met,
you wanted to, um-What was it?

13:40.574 --> 13:44.322
Oh, yes. Yes.
Fry my wings extra crispy.

13:44.494 --> 13:48.243
- Well, that was a misunderstanding.
- Some misunderstanding.

13:48.415 --> 13:50.372
- I need some advice.
- Advice?

13:50.542 --> 13:51.705
Angel advice.

13:51.877 --> 13:53.287
Then go ask your boyfriend.

13:53.462 --> 13:54.956
Cass can't help me.

13:55.756 --> 13:58.293
I need to know if there's a spell,
or a weapon...

13:58.467 --> 14:02.416
anything, that can keep a soul out
forever.

14:02.637 --> 14:05.555
Aw. What's going on, Sam?

14:07.309 --> 14:08.767
It's for me.

14:08.935 --> 14:10.643
Well...

14:11.480 --> 14:13.971
The plot thickens.

14:16.401 --> 14:17.943
Where's your soul, Sam?

14:20.322 --> 14:22.113
Good God, no. It's not still...?

14:25.285 --> 14:26.613
It is.

14:26.787 --> 14:29.324
My brother found a way
to put it back in me.

14:29.498 --> 14:32.285
- I don't want it.
- No, you don't. No, no.

14:32.459 --> 14:36.457
Because Michael and Lucy
are hate-banging it as we speak.

14:36.630 --> 14:38.457
- Can you help me?
- Oh, yes.

14:38.632 --> 14:41.798
The question is, will I?

14:41.968 --> 14:43.000
Set your terms.

14:45.222 --> 14:48.092
- I'll do it for free.
- Free? Heh.

14:49.684 --> 14:52.520
- Why?
- You seem like a capable young man.

14:52.687 --> 14:54.846
I'd love to have you in my debt.

14:55.023 --> 14:57.348
And I have to say,
I'm not a fan of your brother.

14:57.526 --> 15:00.064
So screwing him would delight me.

15:00.612 --> 15:01.940
Anyway, to business.

15:02.114 --> 15:03.608
The spell, yes.

15:03.782 --> 15:06.617
So finding the ingredients
should be easy enough.

15:06.785 --> 15:09.620
- But there's one tricky part, however.
- Okay.

15:09.788 --> 15:11.496
You need to scar your vessel.

15:12.415 --> 15:13.791
Meaning what?

15:13.959 --> 15:18.870
Meaning something that so pollutes it,
it renders it uninhabitable.

15:19.506 --> 15:21.914
Calls for something very specific.

15:22.092 --> 15:24.713
- Great. What?
- Patricide.

15:25.512 --> 15:27.588
- My dad's been dead for years.
- Ha, ha.

15:27.764 --> 15:30.931
To be clear, um,
you need the blood of your father...

15:31.101 --> 15:33.770
but your father needn't be blood.

15:35.439 --> 15:36.684
<i>Comprendes?</i>

15:44.281 --> 15:48.492
Just so you know, when people die,
they might have questions for you.

15:48.660 --> 15:51.495
Well, you know, not you, but Death.

15:51.663 --> 15:54.617
You mean like,
"How did Betty White outlast me?"

15:54.791 --> 15:56.784
"What does it all mean?" is popular.

15:56.960 --> 15:59.285
- And am I just gonna magically know?
- No.

15:59.463 --> 16:00.708
What am I supposed to say?

16:00.881 --> 16:03.502
- Give me something.
- Suck it up. Comes with the gig.

16:03.675 --> 16:05.300
Come on, come on. Let's go!

16:07.846 --> 16:10.551
They can't hear you, can't see you.
Let this play out.

16:10.724 --> 16:12.847
- Well, who am I taking?
- Wait and see.

16:13.018 --> 16:15.556
- Which one?
- You want me to shoot the kid?

16:15.729 --> 16:17.306
Hurry up!

16:17.481 --> 16:21.063
You think I'm kidding? And don't forget
the drawer under the register.

16:22.611 --> 16:24.936
Come on. Move it! Let's go.

16:26.364 --> 16:27.444
You idiot.

16:45.842 --> 16:47.218
Hello? Ticktock.

16:47.761 --> 16:49.421
He's in agonizing pain, right?

16:50.180 --> 16:51.840
Uh, yes.

16:52.724 --> 16:53.803
Give me a minute.

17:22.712 --> 17:25.382
- Why?
- Mostly because you're a dick.

17:26.883 --> 17:28.923
Enjoy the ride down, pal.

17:29.094 --> 17:30.553
Trust me, sauna gets hot.

17:32.055 --> 17:33.799
It's okay.

17:39.980 --> 17:41.604
That wasn't so hard.

17:46.820 --> 17:49.275
Call me crazy,
but this smells like a heart attack.

17:52.576 --> 17:53.821
Lucky guess.

18:11.511 --> 18:12.709
Why?

18:12.888 --> 18:14.679
You think maybe
it was the extra cheese?

18:14.848 --> 18:17.220
Yeah. It was good, though.

18:17.392 --> 18:19.184
- Is that a local place?
- Dean.

18:19.352 --> 18:20.763
Right. Um...

18:20.979 --> 18:23.055
Time to go, man. Sorry.

18:27.277 --> 18:31.275
Wait.
Will you tell me what it all means?

18:37.788 --> 18:40.492
Everything is dust in the wind.

18:42.000 --> 18:45.286
That's it? A Kansas song?

18:45.462 --> 18:47.953
Sorry. He's new.

19:00.727 --> 19:03.052
Woke up and you were gone.
Where you been?

19:03.563 --> 19:05.473
Just driving around. No biggie.

19:06.233 --> 19:09.103
- Drink?
- Yeah. Sure.

19:22.207 --> 19:23.286
After you, boss.

19:24.709 --> 19:29.003
Dad.
Ha, ha. Yeah. It was a lot of fun.

19:29.631 --> 19:30.710
And that one?

19:31.258 --> 19:33.546
That's you,
when we went to California.

19:33.718 --> 19:34.798
You were 6 then.

19:35.011 --> 19:36.719
God.

19:36.888 --> 19:38.762
We should burn that.

19:38.932 --> 19:41.257
You were adorable. Yeah, right.

19:41.435 --> 19:43.511
- The dad or the kid?
- Kid.

19:43.687 --> 19:45.726
Is that me?

19:47.524 --> 19:49.267
Come on. What is she, 13?

19:49.443 --> 19:50.522
She's 12.

19:51.820 --> 19:53.148
And that?

19:53.321 --> 19:57.983
That's your mom,
when she was your age.

19:59.035 --> 20:02.120
- This guy have any other family?
- No, not really.

20:03.874 --> 20:06.281
Oh, I remember that.

20:09.337 --> 20:11.295
Well, this is awesome. What?

20:11.465 --> 20:13.956
You thought it was all gonna be robbers
and heart attacks?

20:14.134 --> 20:16.839
- She's 12.
- With a serious heart condition.

20:19.639 --> 20:20.754
Who's next on the list?

20:20.932 --> 20:23.767
- Dean. You have to take her.
- Says who?

20:23.935 --> 20:25.133
- Death.
- I'm Death.

20:25.312 --> 20:27.139
- You know what I mean.
- Who tells him?

20:27.314 --> 20:29.639
I don't know, it just is. It's destiny.

20:30.233 --> 20:31.478
Oh, give me a break.

20:31.651 --> 20:34.273
I've spent my whole life
fighting that crap.

20:34.446 --> 20:38.064
There's no such thing as destiny,
just like there was no Apocalypse.

20:38.241 --> 20:40.993
Just a bunch of mooks
who didn't want us human slaves...

20:41.161 --> 20:44.826
asking questions.
Well, I say the little girl lives.

20:44.998 --> 20:49.078
Do you know what's amazing? You don't
actually buy a word you're saying.

20:49.503 --> 20:50.665
- Yes, I do.
- Oh, really?

20:50.837 --> 20:53.126
All the times
you messed with life and death...

20:53.298 --> 20:54.840
they just worked out for you?

20:55.008 --> 20:57.760
It was just a beach party every time,
huh?

20:58.220 --> 21:00.212
Well, I know this much:

21:00.388 --> 21:03.425
I'm Death, she's 12...

21:03.600 --> 21:05.308
and she's not dying today.

21:07.020 --> 21:09.891
Let's get it over with.
The surgeon's ready to go.

21:10.065 --> 21:13.932
Yeah.
Everything's gonna be fine. You'll see.

21:43.807 --> 21:47.176
Medically, I can't explain it.

21:47.352 --> 21:50.388
So, ahem, her heart just healed?

21:50.564 --> 21:53.102
Couple of times in your career,
you see something...

21:53.275 --> 21:54.650
you just gotta call a miracle.

21:54.818 --> 21:57.570
All I know is I won't have to operate.

21:57.737 --> 21:59.730
Thank you. Thank you, doctor.

22:01.032 --> 22:02.824
You did it. You're gonna be okay.

22:09.166 --> 22:11.917
Hey, hon. Guess what. I'm leaving.

22:12.085 --> 22:13.745
No, surgery was canceled.

22:13.920 --> 22:15.747
Come on. We have more work here.

22:15.922 --> 22:18.674
Okay. See you soon.

22:18.842 --> 22:20.217
Pair of aces.

22:20.802 --> 22:23.589
- You want another one?
- Yeah, sure.

22:32.981 --> 22:36.931
May have been born at night, boy,
but it wasn't last night.

22:45.494 --> 22:46.656
Not good.

22:57.129 --> 23:00.629
Let's not do anything hasty here, Sam.

23:34.834 --> 23:36.826
Don't say, "Here's Johnny."

23:37.002 --> 23:41.082
I gotta do this, Bobby. I'm sorry.
You shouldn't have cornered yourself.

23:41.257 --> 23:43.249
I didn't.

24:10.911 --> 24:14.494
Reinforced steel core.
Titanium kick plates.

24:14.665 --> 24:16.954
Get comfy.

24:17.126 --> 24:19.415
You wanna explain
what this is about?

24:20.629 --> 24:22.622
I just, uh...

24:23.966 --> 24:26.504
- I have to do this, Bobby.
- Says who?

24:33.642 --> 24:36.976
Dean shoves that soul back in me,
think how bad that could really be.

24:37.521 --> 24:39.395
I can't let it happen, Bobby.

24:39.940 --> 24:43.226
It's not like I wanna kill you.
You've been nothing but good to me.

24:43.611 --> 24:47.560
So, what, demon deal or something?

24:48.407 --> 24:49.486
Spell.

24:49.867 --> 24:51.361
You're making a mistake, Sam.

24:51.535 --> 24:52.650
I'm trying to survive.

24:52.828 --> 24:54.821
Dean's got a way to make it safe.

24:54.997 --> 24:57.286
Oh, yeah, what,
some wall inside my head...

24:57.458 --> 24:59.450
that maybe stays up? Come on.

24:59.627 --> 25:02.165
- If it works-
- Yeah, what if it doesn't?

25:02.338 --> 25:05.671
Dean doesn't care about me.
He just cares about his little brother...

25:05.841 --> 25:07.750
Sammy, burning in hell.

25:07.927 --> 25:09.670
He'll kill me to get that guy back.

25:09.845 --> 25:11.802
Look, I-

25:12.306 --> 25:14.678
I know how scary it is.

25:14.850 --> 25:16.843
But you know what's scarier?

25:17.019 --> 25:18.430
You, right now.

25:19.021 --> 25:21.477
You're not in your right head, Sam.

25:21.649 --> 25:24.436
You're not giving us
much choice here.

25:28.280 --> 25:29.822
Sam?

25:31.700 --> 25:33.574
Balls.

25:40.084 --> 25:43.334
Ain't nobody killing me
in my house but me.

26:03.482 --> 26:06.898
I don't wanna blow your legs out, boy,
but I will.

26:29.633 --> 26:33.417
Oh, what, you're gonna give me
the silent treatment now? Really?

26:35.389 --> 26:37.180
- Damn it. I knew it.
- What?

26:38.559 --> 26:39.804
<i>Five hundred ER.</i>

26:39.977 --> 26:41.257
What's going on? Accident.

26:41.437 --> 26:43.595
Vitals?
Fractured spine, internal bleeding.

26:43.772 --> 26:45.183
Had a heart attack. We need Owens.

26:45.357 --> 26:48.726
He just left.
Call Owens, tell him to turn around.

26:48.903 --> 26:50.942
BP? BP, 60 over 30.

26:51.113 --> 26:53.687
Pupils fixed and dilated.
Push one milligram of epi.

26:53.866 --> 26:55.325
- Start a dopamine drip.
- That's-

26:55.493 --> 26:57.865
You let the girl live,
nurse goes home early...

26:58.037 --> 27:01.406
gets in a crash she wouldn't have,
and she needs the heart surgeon.

27:02.166 --> 27:03.245
Where is he?

27:03.417 --> 27:04.698
Three. All right.

27:04.877 --> 27:06.953
You knew this would happen? No.

27:07.129 --> 27:08.707
Just knew
you knocked over a domino.

27:10.299 --> 27:11.793
Come on.
She's in cardiac arrest.

27:11.967 --> 27:13.592
- Take her.
- What?

27:13.761 --> 27:16.086
- Clear.
- She's not on the list.

27:16.263 --> 27:17.923
Everything you do has consequences.

27:18.098 --> 27:21.467
- Wanna set off another chain reaction?
- She's got nothing to do with this.

27:21.644 --> 27:25.226
Well, too bad, Dean. You put
on the ring, now do your damn job.

27:25.606 --> 27:27.764
Go. Clear.

27:27.942 --> 27:29.187
- No response.
- Fine.

27:29.360 --> 27:31.187
<i>Trauma Zone. Nothing.</i>

27:31.362 --> 27:33.650
She's not gonna make it.
Still nothing.

27:33.823 --> 27:36.740
V- tach. She's crashing again.
We're losing her.

27:36.909 --> 27:38.533
300. 300. Charging.

27:38.702 --> 27:39.865
Clear. Go.

27:41.330 --> 27:43.038
No response. Is that...?

27:43.582 --> 27:45.326
- Still nothing.
- Am I...?

27:45.501 --> 27:47.540
Yes. I'm sorry.

27:49.213 --> 27:50.328
But I'm-

27:50.506 --> 27:52.629
Time of death, 10:43.
So young. Yeah.

27:52.800 --> 27:55.469
Actually, you were supposed
to live for many decades.

27:55.636 --> 27:58.423
Have kids, grandkids.

28:01.809 --> 28:04.893
- Then why?
- Because he screwed up.

28:06.814 --> 28:08.308
You did this to me?

28:11.610 --> 28:13.769
Come on, Jolene. It's time.

28:16.699 --> 28:17.778
Wait.

28:19.827 --> 28:22.033
I'm sorry.

28:32.298 --> 28:35.464
Where is she?
Where's my wife? Where is she?

28:36.177 --> 28:39.213
Scott, wait. We did everything we could.

28:43.184 --> 28:44.594
No.

28:50.733 --> 28:51.895
No.

28:55.237 --> 28:57.479
- A real vacation?
- Yeah.

28:57.948 --> 28:59.740
I can take you to this one café.

28:59.909 --> 29:01.403
Show you where I met your mom.

29:01.577 --> 29:03.534
You saw what happened to the nurse.

29:03.996 --> 29:05.953
Go and kill that girl, Dean.

29:06.123 --> 29:07.498
Get some sleep.

29:09.502 --> 29:12.123
Good night, Daddy.
Night, Hilary.

29:12.296 --> 29:13.956
I love you. I love you too.

29:14.131 --> 29:17.132
I tried to tell you
what you already know.

29:17.635 --> 29:21.929
She's disrupting the natural order
by being alive.

29:22.097 --> 29:24.090
You of all people know
what that means.

29:24.266 --> 29:27.267
Chaos and sadness will follow her
for the rest of her life.

29:27.436 --> 29:29.144
We tried it your way.

29:36.362 --> 29:38.604
- Give me a minute.
- What?

30:26.036 --> 30:29.203
Come on, man. Pull the car over.
You're gonna get yourself killed.

30:29.373 --> 30:32.160
What are you doing?
Pull the damn car over.

30:32.751 --> 30:35.421
Come on. Stop the car.
Come on. Stop the car.

30:35.588 --> 30:37.545
What are you doing? Stop the car!

30:41.135 --> 30:42.463
Son of a bitch.

30:42.636 --> 30:43.751
- Hit the brakes!
- Aah!

31:06.619 --> 31:08.279
Damn it.

31:34.939 --> 31:36.018
Tessa?

31:37.066 --> 31:40.767
You there, Tessa? I lost.

31:42.447 --> 31:44.854
Sam's screwed. You happy?

31:45.033 --> 31:48.283
Least you could do
is zap my ass back home.

31:51.247 --> 31:52.658
Hello?!

32:13.645 --> 32:14.724
I lost the bet.

32:15.396 --> 32:17.722
Sorry about your brother.

32:23.780 --> 32:24.859
Let's just go.

32:25.448 --> 32:27.239
Go where, Dean? We're done.

32:27.408 --> 32:29.448
What are we...?

32:29.661 --> 32:31.321
Unfinished business.

32:34.916 --> 32:37.407
It's over. You took the ring off.

32:37.585 --> 32:39.708
I thought you wanted
the girl to skate by.

32:39.879 --> 32:41.706
No one really skates by.

32:42.382 --> 32:43.924
Do they?

33:02.318 --> 33:04.988
You should say your goodbyes, man.

33:10.326 --> 33:13.493
Man, I must have dozed off.

33:18.042 --> 33:19.501
Hilary?

33:19.961 --> 33:21.159
Somebody! One, two...

33:21.337 --> 33:25.038
three, one. One, two, three, one.
Nothing. Not getting a pulse.

33:25.216 --> 33:27.043
One, two, three, one.

33:27.719 --> 33:29.545
I'm dead?

33:30.179 --> 33:31.259
I'm sorry.

33:31.639 --> 33:33.015
But what about my dad?

33:33.182 --> 33:35.056
- He'll be fine.
- Really?

33:35.226 --> 33:37.183
I have no idea.

33:37.979 --> 33:39.473
I can't just leave him.

33:39.647 --> 33:41.770
- It's not fair.
- I know.

33:42.191 --> 33:43.567
Well, then, why?

33:45.236 --> 33:47.145
Because...

33:48.740 --> 33:51.776
there's sort of
a natural order to things.

33:52.952 --> 33:54.530
Natural order's stupid.

33:55.079 --> 33:57.238
I agree with you there.

34:00.585 --> 34:03.870
Everything we could. I'm so sorry.

34:19.062 --> 34:20.853
Listen to me.

34:21.105 --> 34:22.268
You don't wanna do this.

34:24.900 --> 34:26.099
Sam.

34:29.739 --> 34:31.779
I've been like a father to you, boy.

34:31.949 --> 34:34.357
Somewhere inside
you got to know that.

34:35.911 --> 34:37.821
Well, that's just it.

34:40.041 --> 34:41.156
Sorry.

34:46.589 --> 34:48.629
- Unh!
- Hi, Sam. I'm back.

35:04.067 --> 35:06.440
I can't keep doing this, Bobby.

35:06.612 --> 35:10.063
What, am I gonna tie him up
every time he tries to kill someone?

35:10.240 --> 35:13.941
- That's not gonna hold him. He's-
- Capable of anything.

35:23.003 --> 35:25.161
What am I supposed to do here?

35:27.633 --> 35:28.712
I don't know.

36:01.583 --> 36:02.828
Dean.

36:03.377 --> 36:04.954
Join me.

36:13.178 --> 36:14.257
Brought you one.

36:14.429 --> 36:18.557
From a little stand in Los Angeles
known for their bacon dogs.

36:21.144 --> 36:22.722
Sit.

36:31.154 --> 36:33.028
Wow, what's with you
and cheap food?

36:33.198 --> 36:34.858
I could ask you the same thing.

36:36.702 --> 36:39.537
Thought I'd have a treat
before I put the ring back on.

36:41.957 --> 36:43.499
Heavier than it looks, isn't it?

36:45.586 --> 36:48.255
Sometimes
you just want the thing off.

36:48.714 --> 36:50.422
But you know that.

36:53.844 --> 36:55.089
Not hungry?

36:56.263 --> 37:00.177
Look, I think you know that I flunked.

37:01.018 --> 37:02.476
So there.

37:02.644 --> 37:06.642
Oh, and by the way,
I sucked at being you.

37:07.608 --> 37:10.099
I screwed up the whole
natural-order thing...

37:10.277 --> 37:12.400
but I'm sure you knew
about that too.

37:13.655 --> 37:19.859
So if you could go back,
would you simply kill the little girl?

37:20.037 --> 37:22.325
No fuss, no stomping your feet?

37:22.497 --> 37:24.620
Knowing what I know now? Yeah.

37:25.375 --> 37:27.617
I'm surprised to hear that.

37:28.837 --> 37:31.328
Surprised and glad.

37:31.506 --> 37:34.958
Yeah, don't get excited. I would've
saved the nurse. Okay? That's it.

37:35.135 --> 37:38.053
I think it's a little more than that.

37:38.597 --> 37:41.930
Today, you got a hard look
behind the curtain.

37:43.143 --> 37:46.927
Wrecking the natural order
is not quite such fun...

37:47.105 --> 37:49.643
when you have to
mop up the mess. Is it?

37:50.859 --> 37:53.066
This is hard for you, Dean.

37:53.237 --> 37:55.774
You throw away your life...

37:55.948 --> 37:59.815
because you've come to assume
that it'll bounce back into your lap.

38:00.410 --> 38:04.408
The human soul is not a rubber ball.

38:04.790 --> 38:07.625
It's vulnerable, impermanent...

38:07.793 --> 38:10.081
but stronger than you know...

38:10.254 --> 38:13.872
and more valuable
than you can imagine.

38:18.303 --> 38:19.679
So...

38:20.347 --> 38:23.383
I think you've learned
something today.

38:25.561 --> 38:27.553
Wanna know what I think?

38:29.773 --> 38:31.849
I think you knew
that I wouldn't last a day.

38:32.901 --> 38:35.273
I have no idea
what you're talking about.

38:35.445 --> 38:36.940
I lost. Fine.

38:37.114 --> 38:40.447
But at least have the balls to admit
that it was rigged from the jump.

38:44.121 --> 38:47.075
Most people speak to me
with more respect.

38:48.500 --> 38:50.125
- I didn't mean-
- We're done here.

38:51.086 --> 38:52.580
It's been lovely.

38:53.255 --> 38:58.380
But now I'm going to go to hell
to get your brother's soul.

39:00.512 --> 39:03.798
- Why would you do that for me?
- I wouldn't do it for you.

39:03.974 --> 39:07.177
You and your brother
keep coming back.

39:07.394 --> 39:10.644
You're an affront
to the balance of the universe...

39:10.814 --> 39:13.435
and you cause disruption
on a global scale.

39:14.568 --> 39:17.059
- Apologize for that.
- But you have use.

39:17.654 --> 39:20.062
Right now,
you're digging at something.

39:21.450 --> 39:23.489
The intrepid detective.

39:24.202 --> 39:26.325
I want you to keep digging, Dean.

39:26.872 --> 39:29.908
- So you just gonna be cryptic, or-?
- It's about the souls.

39:32.586 --> 39:35.207
You'll understand
when you need to.

39:36.465 --> 39:37.876
Wait.

39:38.175 --> 39:40.927
With Sam, is this wall thing
really gonna work?

39:41.094 --> 39:42.838
Call it 75 percent.

39:47.476 --> 39:50.181
Bobby? Stay away from me.

39:50.354 --> 39:51.896
- Open the door.
- What happened?

39:52.064 --> 39:53.439
Now.

39:56.652 --> 39:58.395
Get away from me!

40:01.240 --> 40:02.615
Don't.

40:03.533 --> 40:04.862
Don't!

40:10.666 --> 40:12.124
Now, Sam...

40:12.292 --> 40:15.495
I'm gonna put up a barrier
inside your mind.

40:15.671 --> 40:19.799
- No, don't touch me.
- It might feel a little itchy.

40:20.467 --> 40:21.712
Do me a favor.

40:21.885 --> 40:24.803
Don't scratch the wall.

40:28.058 --> 40:32.471
Because, trust me,
you're not gonna like what happens.

40:32.938 --> 40:35.511
Please. Don't do this.

40:46.159 --> 40:49.493
No. No. You don't know.
You don't know what'll happen to me.

40:50.080 --> 40:52.832
Dean, please.

40:53.208 --> 40:55.699
No. No.

40:55.877 --> 40:57.870
No. Aah!
