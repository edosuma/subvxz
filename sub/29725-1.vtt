02:03.931 --> 02:05.099
Cooper!

03:24.611 --> 03:26.647
Who paints a room pink?

04:49.363 --> 04:51.332
Wait, wait...

04:55.801 --> 04:57.001
Don't look at me like that.

04:57.003 --> 04:59.140
You're the one that's gonna
have to shit that out later.

05:25.065 --> 05:26.801
Oh.

05:57.229 --> 05:59.229
Piece of cake.

05:59.231 --> 06:01.301
Jesus Christ!

06:07.373 --> 06:09.840
Doorbell needs fixing.

06:09.842 --> 06:10.878
Bourbon?

06:12.145 --> 06:13.981
What brings you
out to the suburbs?

06:15.282 --> 06:16.780
Change of scenery.

06:16.782 --> 06:19.116
Uh, my wife and I
got a baby on the way,

06:19.118 --> 06:21.453
and this guy needed a yard.

06:21.455 --> 06:22.486
Thought a little bit
of elbow room

06:22.488 --> 06:23.987
would do everybody
some good.

06:23.989 --> 06:25.890
Family's good.

06:25.892 --> 06:27.025
Dirt's good.

06:27.027 --> 06:29.393
Kids can't grow up right
without some mud on their jeans

06:29.395 --> 06:32.030
and a frog
in their pocket.

06:32.032 --> 06:34.234
What about you?
Do you live around here?

06:35.501 --> 06:37.268
Since '84,

06:37.270 --> 06:40.138
long enough to see
my fair share of things

06:40.140 --> 06:41.875
come and go.

06:43.210 --> 06:44.475
So you're a nun...?

06:44.477 --> 06:47.845
Good Lord.

06:47.847 --> 06:50.948
I remember Chicago being
more progressive than that.

06:50.950 --> 06:52.883
No, we're Protestant.

06:52.885 --> 06:54.486
I'm the pastor.

06:54.488 --> 06:56.087
I apologize.
I should've known.

06:56.089 --> 06:57.455
My wife and I
aren't very religious.

06:57.457 --> 06:59.193
- I just didn't...
- Don't sweat it, slick.

07:00.092 --> 07:02.128
We're more laidback
out here.

07:03.162 --> 07:05.265
And my door
is always open,

07:05.998 --> 07:07.835
if you care to learn more.

07:29.289 --> 07:30.354
Hey, Bunny!

07:30.356 --> 07:32.827
<i>Hi, Tiger.
How was your first night?</i>

07:33.527 --> 07:36.227
Oh, great.
Look at this place.

07:36.229 --> 07:38.830
<i>Did you just wake up?</i>

07:38.832 --> 07:41.202
Hey, how's the
little kicker doing?

07:41.935 --> 07:43.404
<i>Say hi to Daddy.</i>

07:48.808 --> 07:50.174
Hey, little Pumpkin Head.

07:50.176 --> 07:51.475
<i>Oh my God,
you're not calling your daughter</i>

07:51.477 --> 07:52.544
<i>"Pumpkin Head."
Please.</i>

07:52.546 --> 07:54.011
Oh, come on, babe.

07:54.013 --> 07:56.047
You've seen the size
of your belly.

07:56.049 --> 07:58.085
That's the only explanation.

07:59.519 --> 08:01.085
<i>So, what's on
the agenda today?</i>

08:01.087 --> 08:02.453
<i>How's the schedule looking?</i>

08:02.455 --> 08:03.821
Oh, the schedule
feels great.

08:03.823 --> 08:05.556
I will finish this room

08:05.558 --> 08:06.624
as soon as I'm off
the phone with you

08:06.626 --> 08:09.326
and I'll move on to the
kitchen in the afternoon.

08:09.328 --> 08:11.996
<i>So what, like painting,
sanding,</i>

08:11.998 --> 08:14.933
<i>opening that giant
gaping hole?</i>

08:14.935 --> 08:17.035
<i>Ugh, are you sure
you don't want me</i>

08:17.037 --> 08:19.070
<i>to call in some pros,
Don?</i>

08:19.072 --> 08:20.237
<i>This is a lot of work.</i>

08:20.239 --> 08:21.405
No, we're not
calling anybody.

08:21.407 --> 08:22.407
I got this.

08:22.409 --> 08:23.407
How could I sleep at night

08:23.409 --> 08:26.109
knowing some other jerkwad
built your castle?

08:26.111 --> 08:29.315
<i>Well, you'd sleep because
the roof wouldn't leak.</i>

08:29.983 --> 08:31.185
<i>What's that?</i>

08:33.452 --> 08:35.285
Oh, there's piles of junk
all over this place.

08:35.288 --> 08:37.154
Please don't be paranoid.

08:37.155 --> 08:38.489
<i>I trust you.</i>

08:38.491 --> 08:39.556
<i>Shit, I got to go.</i>

08:39.558 --> 08:41.893
<i>I've got, um,
team's proposals at ten.</i>

08:41.895 --> 08:43.628
<i>Anyway, I'll call you
tonight, okay?</i>

08:43.630 --> 08:44.863
<i>Love you.</i>

08:44.865 --> 08:46.096
<i>Mwah.</i>

08:46.098 --> 08:47.565
<i>Mwah.</i>

08:47.567 --> 08:49.135
<i>Bye.</i>

08:55.375 --> 08:57.441
<i>"So once you get
your drywall size,</i>

08:57.443 --> 08:59.210
<i>you want to
just check by hand</i>

08:59.212 --> 09:02.213
<i>and see where does
the drywall give in?</i>

09:02.215 --> 09:05.853
<i>Now, luckily, it's only
a small section..."</i>

09:24.036 --> 09:25.603

10:14.654 --> 10:17.357
Oh, piece of shit drill,
motherfucker!

10:44.150 --> 10:45.552
Ow!

10:46.519 --> 10:48.222
Oh, God!

10:59.665 --> 11:01.635
How's it going,
Mr. Koch?

11:05.204 --> 11:06.940
Change of pace, huh?

11:07.674 --> 11:09.706
Something like that.

11:09.708 --> 11:12.442
How's a guy like you
planning to survive out here?

11:12.444 --> 11:13.643
I'll figure it out.

11:13.645 --> 11:16.047
Can't imagine there's
much of a nightlife.

11:16.049 --> 11:18.316
No fancy supper clubs.

11:18.318 --> 11:20.118
No strippers
to woo clients with.

11:20.120 --> 11:21.085
Uh, there's plenty
of strippers.

11:21.087 --> 11:23.354
I just don't have any
clients left to woo.

11:23.356 --> 11:24.622
True.

11:24.624 --> 11:26.391
Which begs the question,

11:26.393 --> 11:28.996
how exactly can you
afford this place?

11:32.332 --> 11:33.764
Good old Liz.

11:33.766 --> 11:36.433
Yeah. I like her.

11:36.435 --> 11:38.402
Smart woman.

11:38.404 --> 11:40.204
How's she accepting
this change?

11:40.206 --> 11:42.739
She will keep her
company running

11:42.741 --> 11:45.176
and she'll commute
once the baby's born.

11:45.178 --> 11:47.077
You know, it's not like
our life's over.

11:47.079 --> 11:48.513
It's just...

11:48.515 --> 11:49.680
...it's maturing.

11:49.682 --> 11:51.382
It'd better be, Don.

11:51.384 --> 11:53.183
Feds cut you one hell
of a sweetheart deal,

11:53.185 --> 11:54.652
all things considered.

11:54.654 --> 11:57.057
Be a shame if you
fucked it all up again.

11:59.592 --> 12:00.557
That it?

12:00.559 --> 12:01.526
Yeah.

12:01.528 --> 12:03.197
That's the last of it.

12:04.530 --> 12:06.332
That's a beautiful church.

12:47.807 --> 12:49.510
Oh, shit!

13:09.828 --> 13:11.531
You gonna be okay?

13:15.735 --> 13:17.471
Don't shit in the house.

14:10.523 --> 14:13.260
Goddamn machine
likes to eat balls.

14:15.194 --> 14:17.195
You hungry or thirsty?

14:17.197 --> 14:18.696
Both.

14:18.698 --> 14:20.730
Cocktails I have
some control over.

14:20.732 --> 14:22.768
Food can be hit or miss.

14:23.970 --> 14:26.269
Well let's start
with a drink, then.

14:26.271 --> 14:27.840
Smart man.

14:35.648 --> 14:37.248
It's not bad.

14:37.250 --> 14:39.352
I'll quote you
in the next ad.

14:39.818 --> 14:43.753
So, uh,
are you visiting or lost?

14:43.755 --> 14:44.821
Resident.

14:44.823 --> 14:46.859
I, uh, just bought the house
on Saul and Circle.

14:51.331 --> 14:52.830
What?

14:52.832 --> 14:54.532
You queer?

14:54.534 --> 14:55.532
Excuse me?

14:55.534 --> 14:57.500
It's a simple question.

14:57.502 --> 14:58.301
Yeah, I'm about
to have a kid.

14:58.303 --> 14:59.604
What kind of
a question is that?

14:59.606 --> 15:00.372
Easy, Don.

15:00.374 --> 15:02.473
Gay people
can have kids, too.

15:02.475 --> 15:04.374
Nothing wrong with that.

15:04.376 --> 15:06.512
I know that.
I...

15:07.313 --> 15:08.749
I'm happily married.

15:09.381 --> 15:10.981
Of course, you are.

15:10.983 --> 15:12.385
I'm sorry.

15:13.553 --> 15:17.888
That house just seems to be
bad news for straight men.

15:17.890 --> 15:20.894
Uh, but, uh,
I'm sure you'll be fine.

15:24.463 --> 15:26.232
How about a shot?

15:31.837 --> 15:33.604
You've got a real fucked up
way of welcoming people

15:33.606 --> 15:35.509
to the neighborhood,
Geary.

15:49.355 --> 15:50.824
Cooper!

16:42.842 --> 16:44.678
Cooper!

17:02.060 --> 17:03.027
Cooper?

17:03.029 --> 17:04.630
Shit!

17:05.931 --> 17:07.967
You really suck,
you know that?

17:09.901 --> 17:10.967
<i>You know,
Cleo and Jason</i>

17:10.969 --> 17:12.903
<i>brought up the Hyde Park
Project again.</i>

17:12.905 --> 17:14.871
<i>So frustrating</i>

17:14.873 --> 17:16.609
<i>to keep having
to telling them no.</i>

17:17.576 --> 17:18.708
<i>You know what I also hate?</i>

17:18.710 --> 17:20.579
<i>Having to pee all the time.</i>

17:21.513 --> 17:23.012
<i>God, if these things
get any more swollen</i>

17:23.015 --> 17:25.384
<i>I won't be able to
stand up straight.</i>

17:26.585 --> 17:28.686
<i>So, how is it going
over there?</i>

17:28.688 --> 17:30.521
Great.
I got a ton done today.

17:30.523 --> 17:32.122
I'm feeling positive
about it.

17:32.124 --> 17:34.425
<i>That's wonderful, babe.</i>

17:34.427 --> 17:35.996
<i>How's the kitchen
shaping up?</i>

17:37.063 --> 17:38.529
Well, I actually
didn't make it

17:38.531 --> 17:39.563
into the kitchen today,

17:39.565 --> 17:42.832
but it is the first thing
on tomorrow's list.

17:42.834 --> 17:44.033
<i>Are you sure you
don't need some</i>

17:44.035 --> 17:45.836
<i>extra hands, babe?</i>

17:45.838 --> 17:47.103
I'm sure, Bunny.

17:47.105 --> 17:48.539
Everything's going fine.

17:48.541 --> 17:51.108
Don't forget Milo's
coming up this weekend.

17:51.110 --> 17:52.776
But if you wanna help,

17:52.778 --> 17:54.578
you can do me a favor
right now.

17:54.580 --> 17:55.411
<i>What's that?</i>

17:55.413 --> 17:56.880
Just tilt that
phone down to those

17:56.882 --> 17:59.385
beautiful boobs
one more time.

18:01.787 --> 18:04.123
<i>That's all you get
until I see a finished kitchen.</i>

18:04.923 --> 18:06.189
<i>All right.
Good night.</i>

18:06.191 --> 18:07.760
<i>Mwah!</i>

18:14.534 --> 18:16.199
<i>Hi, Daddy.</i>

18:16.201 --> 18:19.536
<i>I've been such a naughty,
naughty girl.</i>

18:19.538 --> 18:22.475
<i>You always know
exactly how to treat me.</i>

18:24.177 --> 18:26.980
<i>Oh, I'll do whatever
you say, Daddy.</i>

18:28.046 --> 18:30.613
<i>Are you gonna punish me?</i>

18:30.615 --> 18:31.784
<i>Hi, Daddy.</i>

18:32.919 --> 18:35.488
<i>I've been such a naughty,
naughty girl.</i>

19:01.214 --> 19:04.484
Hey, hey, out!

19:58.537 --> 19:59.839
That looks terrific.

20:01.673 --> 20:03.640
Old pipes.

20:03.642 --> 20:05.178
They don't look so old.

20:09.649 --> 20:11.282
Can I help you
with something?

20:11.284 --> 20:13.216
I just like it here.

20:13.218 --> 20:15.051
- What?
- The house.

20:15.053 --> 20:16.753
It's usually empty.

20:16.755 --> 20:19.156
Oh, well, I bought it.

20:19.158 --> 20:20.760
So it's not empty anymore.

20:21.326 --> 20:23.529
Hmm, shame.

20:26.298 --> 20:29.766
Uh, I'd better get
back inside.

20:29.768 --> 20:31.936
Sure.
No problem.

20:31.938 --> 20:33.640
See you around.

Oh, Christ.

24:22.868 --> 24:24.337
Still smoke, Dad?

24:26.971 --> 24:28.871
And in here,
we will change this wallpaper

24:28.873 --> 24:31.308
to something
a lot less hideous.

24:31.310 --> 24:32.812
Who's "we?"

24:35.014 --> 24:36.815
My wife and I.

24:38.484 --> 24:41.584
Are you sure?
It's very retro.

24:41.586 --> 24:43.489
You might end up
regretting it.

24:44.290 --> 24:47.090
Uh, well, I'll let you know
if we lose any sleep over it.

24:47.092 --> 24:49.963
A man who never
second-guesses himself, huh?

24:50.996 --> 24:52.165
What's this?

24:53.098 --> 24:54.298
Now, this...

24:54.300 --> 24:55.965
This is retro.

24:55.967 --> 24:58.837
A tiny closet?

25:16.322 --> 25:18.621
Please tell me you guys
are keeping this.

25:18.623 --> 25:20.424
Entire reason
I bought the house.

25:20.426 --> 25:22.395
You have great taste.

25:25.930 --> 25:27.534
What's in here?

25:31.937 --> 25:33.337
- White?
- Oh, you got me.

25:33.339 --> 25:34.503
The wife picked it out.

25:34.505 --> 25:36.540
I think it was called
"French Vanilla"

25:36.542 --> 25:37.574
or something like that.

25:37.576 --> 25:40.310
It's supposed to be
next year's trendy color.

25:40.312 --> 25:42.115
Hmm.

25:42.948 --> 25:45.118
Anything else
you wanna show me?

25:56.195 --> 25:57.628
Can you do me a favor?

25:57.630 --> 25:59.329
<i>What's that?</i>

25:59.331 --> 26:00.664
<i>Choke me.</i>

26:00.666 --> 26:02.302
<i>Hmm.</i>

26:30.094 --> 26:32.297
This dress looked
better on the floor.

26:34.400 --> 26:36.636
That was even better
than I hoped for.

26:57.022 --> 26:59.255
Oh, don't look
at me like that.

26:59.257 --> 27:00.425
I earned that.

28:00.486 --> 28:01.752
<i>That is insane!</i>

28:01.754 --> 28:04.754
I know.
Well, check this out.

28:04.756 --> 28:07.256
<i>What the hell is that?</i>

28:07.258 --> 28:09.559
I don't know.
Bleachers?

28:09.561 --> 28:12.195
Hey, maybe they heard about
how hot our sex life is

28:12.197 --> 28:13.362
and had them installed,
huh?

28:13.364 --> 28:15.398
<i>Oh, my God.</i>

28:15.400 --> 28:17.134
<i>I just don't understand
how you missed this</i>

28:17.136 --> 28:18.404
<i>during the appraisal.</i>

28:20.038 --> 28:22.472
You were here too,
and these weren't.

28:22.474 --> 28:24.541
<i>I'm gonna call
the real estate agent.</i>

28:24.543 --> 28:25.408
Why?

28:25.410 --> 28:27.244
What is she going to do?
They're here.

28:27.246 --> 28:28.779
<i>Because I want them gone.</i>

28:28.781 --> 28:30.446
<i>The ceiling repair is gonna
cost time and money</i>

28:30.448 --> 28:32.049
- <i>and we should be compensated.</i>
- Bunny...

28:32.051 --> 28:34.150
Bunny, relax, okay?
This is an easy fix.

28:34.152 --> 28:36.419
It's probably just
a shoddy patch, all right?

28:36.421 --> 28:37.554
<i>No structural damage.</i>

28:37.556 --> 28:39.488
<i>Me and Milo can tackle this,
no problem.</i>

28:39.490 --> 28:41.524
<i>Trust me, okay?</i>

28:41.526 --> 28:42.560
<i>I trust you, babe.</i>

28:42.562 --> 28:43.659
<i>I just don't want you
to bite off</i>

28:43.661 --> 28:45.364
<i>more than you can chew.</i>

28:49.567 --> 28:51.636
Eh, I should have got
a dumpster.

29:20.198 --> 29:21.633
What you doing?

29:24.203 --> 29:25.069
You know me,

29:25.071 --> 29:28.241
I'm just working hard,
cranking away.

29:28.739 --> 29:30.543
Sounds fun.

29:31.176 --> 29:32.611
Want some help?

29:33.344 --> 29:34.644
Nah.

29:34.646 --> 29:36.245
Doing a bunch of
heavy lifting in here.

29:36.247 --> 29:38.215
I got this.

29:38.217 --> 29:40.119
Okay.

29:43.655 --> 29:48.224
Look, last night
was super-hot,

29:48.226 --> 29:49.725
but we shouldn't.

29:49.727 --> 29:51.261
You know, I got to get
this place tip-top

29:51.263 --> 29:52.728
before the wife
and baby get here,

29:52.730 --> 29:54.598
and there's still, like,

29:54.600 --> 29:56.669
a laundry list
of things to do.

29:57.703 --> 30:01.140
True, but that's later.

30:01.840 --> 30:03.609
What about right now?

30:11.816 --> 30:14.120
I can't.
I'm sure you understand.

30:16.588 --> 30:18.388
Sure.

30:18.390 --> 30:20.293
I understand.

31:06.604 --> 31:08.571
Hey, Tiger.

31:08.573 --> 31:10.877
- Jesus...
- Shh.

32:29.353 --> 32:30.389
What the fuck?

33:39.358 --> 33:41.360
It's Saturday, idiot.

33:42.627 --> 33:43.996
Nice doorbell.

33:45.096 --> 33:48.933
Well, that's certainly creepy.

33:49.601 --> 33:52.004
You don't know
the half of it.

33:52.737 --> 33:55.138
Did you freaks pay extra
for that feature or...

33:55.140 --> 33:56.473
Shut up, dick.

33:56.475 --> 33:57.573
We didn't know
this was there.

33:57.575 --> 33:59.475
Well, I don't know, man.

33:59.477 --> 34:01.677
Turn the attic
into a guest room.

34:01.679 --> 34:04.816
Airbnb it,
charge a fortune to watch.

34:05.617 --> 34:06.849
This is gone
by the weekend

34:06.851 --> 34:09.621
or there's not gonna be
a wife left to watch.

34:10.822 --> 34:12.155
Well, for the sake
of your kid,

34:12.157 --> 34:14.556
we better get to work.

34:14.559 --> 34:16.091
Where are your tools?

34:16.092 --> 34:17.661
Right there.

34:18.963 --> 34:20.862
That's it?

34:20.864 --> 34:22.630
You plan on renovating
an entire house

34:22.632 --> 34:24.533
with a Swiss army knife?

34:24.534 --> 34:26.505
What?
Is that not enough?

34:28.407 --> 34:29.975
No.

34:41.786 --> 34:43.621
Lift.

34:46.956 --> 34:48.824
- You good?
- Yeah.

34:48.827 --> 34:50.159
All right.
Here we go.

34:50.161 --> 34:51.860
How's the firm anyway?

34:51.862 --> 34:52.695
Shit.

34:52.697 --> 34:55.532
New regulations
got us by the balls.

34:55.534 --> 34:57.633
You got out
at the right time.

34:57.635 --> 35:00.003
Maybe not gracefully,
but, you know?

35:00.005 --> 35:01.838
You still making money,
at least?

35:01.840 --> 35:02.905
Not as much.

35:02.907 --> 35:05.207
Have to work
twice as hard for it.

35:05.209 --> 35:07.142
Need to find a Liz
for myself.

35:07.144 --> 35:09.211
It's a bad idea if you, uh,

35:09.213 --> 35:11.481
are afraid of hard work.

35:11.483 --> 35:13.682
Motherfucker, you don't
see me holding the other side

35:13.684 --> 35:16.151
of this heavy-ass drywall
above my head?

35:16.153 --> 35:17.820
Free of charge,
I might add?

35:17.822 --> 35:19.689
Hey, listen, all the money
I've made you,

35:19.691 --> 35:23.062
couple hours of gratis
isn't too much to ask.

35:24.796 --> 35:26.999
Well, you do have
a pretty nice house.

35:35.907 --> 35:38.778
What's next?
Applebee's?

35:52.090 --> 35:53.758
Is that the wife?

35:57.762 --> 36:00.562
You mean this modest
motherfucker didn't tell you?

36:00.564 --> 36:02.198
He basically ran Chicago.

36:02.200 --> 36:04.501
King Don, we called him.

36:04.503 --> 36:05.702
I had a good run.

36:05.704 --> 36:06.637
Whoa.

36:06.639 --> 36:09.905
You traded a penthouse
for a whorehouse?

36:09.907 --> 36:13.845
That might officially make
you the craziest man in town.

36:14.778 --> 36:16.713
Wait, what?

36:16.715 --> 36:19.048
Oh, he didn't tell you?

36:19.050 --> 36:21.584
King Don is the proud owner

36:21.586 --> 36:25.220
of Portsmith's former
house of ill repute.

36:25.222 --> 36:27.189
That was over
a hundred years ago.

36:27.191 --> 36:29.928
Well, might explain
some things, though.

36:30.595 --> 36:32.528
Speaking of pleasure,

36:32.530 --> 36:34.731
a little light on options
in here, isn't it?

36:34.733 --> 36:37.733
You move to the suburbs
to start a family,

36:37.735 --> 36:41.104
or because everyone thinks
you're an asshole.

36:41.106 --> 36:42.905
Right.
Because you're an asshole.

36:42.907 --> 36:45.008
Certainly there's a college
around here, right?

36:45.010 --> 36:47.843
Like, I saw one or two cute
girls walking around earlier.

36:47.845 --> 36:48.745
No college.

36:48.747 --> 36:52.916
But, uh, Gwen Martin
will be in later.

36:52.918 --> 36:54.082
Oh?

36:54.084 --> 36:55.551
Who's Gwen Martin?

36:55.553 --> 36:57.889
She runs an erotic
pottery class.

36:58.722 --> 37:01.090
She's a feminist, though.

37:01.092 --> 37:02.258
That's great.

37:02.260 --> 37:04.229
I'm a feminist.

37:05.630 --> 37:07.131
Me too, son.

37:26.184 --> 37:27.950
Promise me you won't
say a word to Liz

37:27.952 --> 37:29.952
about last night.

37:29.954 --> 37:31.954
I swore to her
I wouldn't drink.

37:31.956 --> 37:34.189
Bro code, bro!

37:34.191 --> 37:35.725
Good man.

37:35.727 --> 37:37.260
My head's killing me.
I need coffee.

37:37.262 --> 37:38.128
You want some?

37:38.130 --> 37:40.698
Your assistant
already brewed a pot.

37:48.974 --> 37:50.276
Morning, Don.

37:54.912 --> 37:56.646
What the hell
are you doing here?

37:56.648 --> 37:57.847
I stopped by.

37:57.849 --> 37:59.749
Milo let me in.
What's wrong?

37:59.751 --> 38:01.954
"What's wrong?"
Are you kidding me?

38:04.055 --> 38:06.122
All right.
Let's get something straight.

38:06.124 --> 38:09.024
This is my life...

38:09.026 --> 38:10.892
Sarah.
My name is Sarah.

38:10.894 --> 38:11.827
Great, Sarah.

38:11.829 --> 38:14.763
Look, I'm not
fucking around right now.

38:14.765 --> 38:17.265
It was a fun night,
don't get me wrong,

38:17.267 --> 38:20.035
but I don't ever wanna see you
here in my house ever again.

38:20.037 --> 38:22.204
You understand me?

38:22.206 --> 38:24.073
Sure, man.

38:24.075 --> 38:26.178
Don't make it weird.

38:27.345 --> 38:29.348
All good in here?

38:39.390 --> 38:40.890
What the fuck was that?

38:40.892 --> 38:43.291
Nothing. Nothing.

38:43.293 --> 38:44.292
Don't worry about it.

38:44.294 --> 38:47.195
Come on,
don't bullshit me, Don.

38:47.197 --> 38:47.930
What did you do?

38:47.932 --> 38:49.899
I didn't do anything,
okay?

38:49.901 --> 38:50.867
You're overreacting.

38:50.869 --> 38:52.934
You're standing there
threatening a woman

38:52.936 --> 38:54.906
and I'm overreacting?

38:55.407 --> 38:56.972
All right.

38:56.974 --> 38:59.841
Look, between you and me,
I fucked up, all right?

38:59.843 --> 39:00.943
I didn't go looking for it.

39:00.945 --> 39:03.312
I didn't ask for it,
I didn't even really want it.

39:03.314 --> 39:05.448
It just happened,
she came back.

39:05.450 --> 39:07.149
I explained to her
it was a mistake.

39:07.151 --> 39:08.151
It's not gonna be a problem.

39:08.153 --> 39:09.818
Can we just go to the
hardware store for...

39:09.820 --> 39:11.187
How many times
are you gonna fuck up

39:11.189 --> 39:13.256
until you get a clue?

39:13.258 --> 39:16.091
Liz is pregnant.
That's your blood.

39:16.093 --> 39:18.727
And you're out here trying
to recapture your glory days

39:18.729 --> 39:22.198
while she's busting ass
to keep a roof over your head?

39:22.200 --> 39:23.999
She's my friend, dude.

39:24.001 --> 39:26.401
What... How am I supposed
to look her in the eye now?

39:26.403 --> 39:28.204
Liz doesn't need
to find out, okay?

39:28.206 --> 39:30.707
Everything's gonna be fine.

39:30.709 --> 39:32.274
When are you gonna start
thinking about someone

39:32.276 --> 39:33.209
other than yourself?

39:33.211 --> 39:37.113
Oh, fuck,
it is what it is, Milo, okay?

39:37.115 --> 39:38.881
If you can't handle it,

39:38.883 --> 39:41.352
don't be here
when I come back!

39:42.253 --> 39:44.256
Cooper!

40:44.014 --> 40:46.017
Of course not.

41:02.332 --> 41:04.135
You like my trick?

41:05.068 --> 41:07.269
Sarah, are you crazy?
I almost fucked you up.

41:07.271 --> 41:09.140
I'm just playing.

41:11.242 --> 41:14.343
Look, I'm sorry
Don's such an asshole

41:14.345 --> 41:16.448
but you need
to get out of here.

41:17.816 --> 41:19.284
Well, that's no fun.

42:14.606 --> 42:17.508
You wanna help me
or what?

42:34.157 --> 42:35.993
Milo?

43:12.963 --> 43:16.267
All right, dick,
you can come out now.

44:24.068 --> 44:25.401
Oh, it's been a killer
weekend, Bun.

44:25.403 --> 44:27.169
We got a ton done.

44:27.171 --> 44:28.169
<i>Did Milo have fun</i>

44:28.171 --> 44:28.970
<i>or did you just
work him to death?</i>

44:28.972 --> 44:31.173
He wanted to work
the whole time.

44:31.175 --> 44:32.173
Check this out.

44:32.175 --> 44:33.376
<i>Wow.</i>

44:33.378 --> 44:35.077
<i>I'm seriously impressed,
Tiger.</i>

44:35.079 --> 44:36.548
I told you not to worry.

44:38.448 --> 44:39.582
<i>Wait, what was that?</i>

44:39.584 --> 44:40.582
What?

44:40.584 --> 44:42.220
<i>I just saw
something behind you.</i>

44:44.255 --> 44:46.057
What are you
talking about?

44:59.070 --> 45:01.637
<i>Don, don't mess with me,
is Milo still there?</i>

45:01.639 --> 45:02.370
No.

45:02.372 --> 45:04.305
He had to head
back to work.

45:04.307 --> 45:05.744
Are you sure?

45:09.213 --> 45:10.512
<i>I don't know.</i>

45:10.514 --> 45:12.782
<i>I thought I saw someone.
Now I'm getting freaked out.</i>

45:12.784 --> 45:13.816
Well, you're not
the one who has to

45:13.818 --> 45:15.550
sleep here tonight,
Bunny.

45:15.552 --> 45:17.153
Check all this out.

45:17.155 --> 45:19.124
<i>Wow, it looks great,
babe.</i>

45:25.829 --> 45:27.162
Babe, if somebody else
was in here,

45:27.164 --> 45:29.330
Cooper would be
all crazy right now.

45:29.332 --> 45:30.765
<i>Good point.</i>

45:30.767 --> 45:32.267
You want I should
sleep with a hammer

45:32.269 --> 45:34.070
under my pillow tonight,
just in case?

45:34.072 --> 45:35.437
<i>You probably better.</i>

45:35.439 --> 45:37.342
<i>I don't want to have to kill
someone when I get there.</i>

45:46.517 --> 45:47.850
<i>Are you okay?</i>

45:47.852 --> 45:48.718
Yeah.

45:48.720 --> 45:50.285
Yeah.
I'm just getting tired, babe.

45:50.287 --> 45:51.454
<i>Well, rest up,
okay, babe?</i>

45:51.456 --> 45:53.325
<i>I'll call you tomorrow.</i>

46:06.637 --> 46:08.640
What the fuck?

46:52.416 --> 46:55.253
Ah!

46:58.722 --> 47:00.724
How's it going, Don?

47:05.496 --> 47:07.365
You wanna talk about it?

47:11.269 --> 47:13.205
Nothing to talk about.

47:14.238 --> 47:16.405
Let's start with the house.

47:16.407 --> 47:18.376
How is she coming along?

47:18.943 --> 47:20.608
Just fine.

47:20.610 --> 47:22.443
Fine, huh?

47:22.445 --> 47:25.280
You know, when a woman
gets to be a certain age,

47:25.282 --> 47:28.283
she doesn't like to be
futzed with too much.

47:28.285 --> 47:30.521
Houses aren't that different,
I guess.

47:36.660 --> 47:39.562
It's...

47:39.564 --> 47:41.363
It's been hard.

47:41.365 --> 47:43.798
I bet.

47:43.800 --> 47:45.436
This house is a bitch.

47:48.872 --> 47:50.506
What's that mean?

47:50.508 --> 47:54.376
Well, just that certain
places have personalities,

47:54.378 --> 47:56.680
and sometimes they're rotten.

47:57.981 --> 48:01.152
It takes a real strong hand
to turn them around again.

48:05.256 --> 48:06.888
I'm trying.

48:06.890 --> 48:08.856
"Blessed is the man
who remains

48:08.858 --> 48:11.595
steadfast under trial."

49:26.871 --> 49:28.773
Hi, handsome.

49:40.550 --> 49:43.287
Coop?

50:12.650 --> 50:14.485
Cooper?

51:32.496 --> 51:34.631
- Sarah?
- Sarah, yeah.

51:35.633 --> 51:37.198
No last name?

51:37.200 --> 51:38.834
I imagine she has one

51:38.836 --> 51:40.669
but I didn't check her ID,
okay?

51:40.671 --> 51:41.702
She lives
in the neighborhood,

51:41.704 --> 51:43.972
she won't stop
fucking with me!

51:43.974 --> 51:45.110
Look.

51:49.914 --> 51:51.680
And?

51:51.682 --> 51:52.814
And?!

51:52.816 --> 51:53.783
You see the dog, right?

51:53.785 --> 51:55.550
You think he jumped
into the goddamn dryer

51:55.552 --> 51:56.584
by himself?

51:56.586 --> 51:58.053
Did he turn it on, too?

51:58.055 --> 52:00.457
Come on, man.
It was her.

52:02.559 --> 52:04.926
Milo!

52:04.928 --> 52:06.562
Call me back.

52:06.564 --> 52:08.196
Look, I'll put the name
and the description

52:08.198 --> 52:09.030
in my report.

52:09.032 --> 52:10.899
But there's no signs
of forced entry,

52:10.901 --> 52:12.468
no evidence of a struggle,

52:12.470 --> 52:13.968
and you were sleeping
upstairs the whole time

52:13.970 --> 52:15.204
and didn't hear a thing.

52:15.206 --> 52:16.004
Oh, great.

52:16.006 --> 52:16.905
Well, thank you
for your service.

52:16.907 --> 52:19.541
Is this your idea
of law enforcement?

52:19.543 --> 52:21.510
You just poke your head
and you shrug your shoulders

52:21.512 --> 52:22.144
like a dipshit.

52:22.146 --> 52:24.546
You didn't do anything.

52:24.548 --> 52:27.519
Please let us know
if anything else comes up...

52:28.885 --> 52:29.920
King Don.

53:25.976 --> 53:28.680
<i>I hate what you've done
with the place.</i>

53:33.717 --> 53:35.052
I'm sorry.

53:37.621 --> 53:39.224
For what?

53:42.325 --> 53:47.564
I'm sorry for not being
honest from the start.

53:48.666 --> 53:51.135
I'm sorry for
treating you unfairly.

53:52.202 --> 53:55.707
I'm sorry for making
you feel unimportant.

53:56.941 --> 53:59.177
And most of all,
I'm sorry for threatening you.

54:01.211 --> 54:03.077
Wow.

54:03.079 --> 54:04.848
Did you rehearse that?

54:07.584 --> 54:09.553
I deserved that,
but no.

54:14.724 --> 54:15.791
I mean it, I'm sorry.

54:15.793 --> 54:19.361
I understand why
you feel so angry.

54:19.363 --> 54:20.928
Well, it's not
a very nice way

54:20.930 --> 54:23.001
to treat someone, Don.

54:24.068 --> 54:27.205
I hope you treat your wife
and kid better than this.

54:30.039 --> 54:32.643
I love my wife.

54:34.945 --> 54:37.247
And I wish I was stronger.

54:41.285 --> 54:43.721
To make all this up to you,
I got you something.

54:45.356 --> 54:47.959
A gift from a married man.

54:49.325 --> 54:51.295
Sounds a lot like a bribe.

54:55.666 --> 54:58.135
If you're interested,
it's in the kitchen.

55:07.778 --> 55:10.646
I appreciate the apology,
Don.

55:10.648 --> 55:12.617
I don't want things
to get any uglier.

57:14.771 --> 57:16.037
Hey, Bunny.

57:16.039 --> 57:18.106
<i>Hey, Tiger?
What you doin'?</i>

57:18.108 --> 57:20.041
Oh.

57:20.043 --> 57:21.778
Just working.

57:23.046 --> 57:25.180
<i>So, I got a text
from Milo.</i>

57:25.182 --> 57:26.448
Oh, yeah?

57:26.450 --> 57:28.883
<i>It was kind of weird.
He said we needed to talk.</i>

57:28.885 --> 57:30.050
<i>Any idea why?</i>

57:30.052 --> 57:31.887
No,
I have no clue, babe.

57:31.889 --> 57:33.254
<i>Don,
just be honest with me.</i>

57:33.256 --> 57:34.856
<i>Look, is the renovation
in trouble?</i>

57:34.858 --> 57:36.193
<i>Is that what it is?</i>

57:37.293 --> 57:38.994
<i>Did he see some things
that he thinks</i>

57:38.996 --> 57:40.861
<i>I should know about?</i>

57:40.863 --> 57:43.166
No!

57:43.800 --> 57:45.100
<i>Tiger, calm down.</i>

57:45.102 --> 57:47.269
Everything is fine, Liz!
All right?

57:47.271 --> 57:50.070
You're gonna throw this
in my face now?!

57:50.072 --> 57:52.006
I have no idea why
Milo called you,

57:52.008 --> 57:57.111
but please, by all means,
call him, find out.

57:57.113 --> 58:00.784
I'm busy.
I... I wanna get back to work.

58:08.157 --> 58:09.893
Shit!

59:26.903 --> 59:28.472
Sarah!

01:02:16.372 --> 01:02:18.608
What the fuck!

01:03:07.124 --> 01:03:08.325
Oh God!

01:03:30.347 --> 01:03:32.213
<i>"You've reached the voicemail
of Officer Henry Baker</i>

01:03:32.215 --> 01:03:33.515
<i>of the Portsmith
Police Department.</i>

01:03:33.517 --> 01:03:35.582
<i>Please state your name,
number, and detailed message</i>

01:03:35.584 --> 01:03:37.253
<i>at the sound of the tone.</i>

01:05:07.309 --> 01:05:09.880
Please stop!

01:05:37.340 --> 01:05:39.573
Why?

01:05:39.575 --> 01:05:41.843
Why are you
doing this to me?

01:05:41.845 --> 01:05:44.582
Stay away from me!

01:06:00.630 --> 01:06:02.497
Hello?

01:06:02.499 --> 01:06:04.599
Tiger?

01:06:04.601 --> 01:06:06.769
Cooper,
come here, boy.

01:06:08.838 --> 01:06:10.474
Hello?

01:06:18.782 --> 01:06:21.552
Cooper, come here.

01:06:44.541 --> 01:06:46.309
Absolutely not.

01:06:59.923 --> 01:07:02.593
Oh, Jesus, Don,
no dropcloth?

01:07:09.898 --> 01:07:13.036
Oh, Jesus, Don,
what did you spill here?

01:07:40.997 --> 01:07:44.501
What are you doing, Don?

01:07:59.416 --> 01:08:00.984
Oh my God.

01:08:45.027 --> 01:08:46.863
Come on, Donald.

01:09:21.263 --> 01:09:23.566
What are you up to?

01:09:37.045 --> 01:09:38.912
Jesus!

01:09:38.915 --> 01:09:40.517
I'm so, so, so sorry.

01:09:43.286 --> 01:09:45.019
Uh, I'm sorry,
can I help you?

01:09:45.020 --> 01:09:46.118
I didn't mean
to frighten you.

01:09:46.121 --> 01:09:47.654
My name is Sarah.

01:09:47.656 --> 01:09:48.991
I've been helping Don.

01:09:50.593 --> 01:09:52.091
Uh, hel... helping Don?

01:09:52.094 --> 01:09:54.595
I'm sorry, what does,
what does that mean exactly?

01:09:54.597 --> 01:09:56.867
You know, getting the house
ready for you.

01:09:57.767 --> 01:10:00.668
Because you're a carpenter?

01:10:00.670 --> 01:10:03.837
No, ma'am.
More like a gofer.

01:10:03.839 --> 01:10:06.606
"Drywall screws, boss?
Sure thing!"

01:10:06.608 --> 01:10:08.809
I'm an architecture nut.
Don couldn't say no.

01:10:08.811 --> 01:10:11.482
No. That definitely
isn't his strong suit.

01:10:13.049 --> 01:10:14.782
How long?

01:10:14.784 --> 01:10:15.983
I'm sorry?

01:10:15.985 --> 01:10:17.017
Your baby?

01:10:17.019 --> 01:10:19.055
How long till she's due?

01:10:19.789 --> 01:10:21.154
Uh, twelve weeks.

01:10:21.156 --> 01:10:23.791
If she's anything like me,
she'll be on time.

01:10:23.793 --> 01:10:25.696
If she's like her father,
much later.

01:10:26.295 --> 01:10:27.127
May I?

01:10:27.129 --> 01:10:28.731
Oh, I don't think so.

01:10:30.133 --> 01:10:31.602
Someone's here.

01:10:43.646 --> 01:10:44.779
Missus Koch?

01:10:44.781 --> 01:10:45.346
Yes?

01:10:45.348 --> 01:10:47.582
I'm Ellie Mueller.

01:10:47.584 --> 01:10:48.649
Can we talk?

01:10:48.651 --> 01:10:50.918
Let me guess,
you're the plumber?

01:10:50.920 --> 01:10:53.921
Uh, no, darling,
I work across the street.

01:10:53.923 --> 01:10:55.826
But I do deal with
a lot of people's shit.

01:10:57.293 --> 01:10:59.327
That's right,
Don did mention you, sorry.

01:10:59.329 --> 01:11:01.796
Would, would you
like to come in?

01:11:01.798 --> 01:11:03.965
Why don't we chat
outside instead?

01:11:03.967 --> 01:11:06.836
Okay. Sure, just, uh,
give me a sec, okay?

01:11:10.173 --> 01:11:12.675
Hey, sorry to be rude
but, um...

01:11:13.142 --> 01:11:14.811
Hello?

01:11:17.045 --> 01:11:18.846
So how's Don doing?

01:11:18.848 --> 01:11:22.283
He looks tired,
but he's a workhorse.

01:11:22.285 --> 01:11:24.385
Where... where is he now?

01:11:24.387 --> 01:11:25.319
I'm not really sure.

01:11:25.321 --> 01:11:27.887
He must have just
taken the dog for a run.

01:11:27.889 --> 01:11:31.794
I, I should have called first,
but I wanted to surprise him.

01:11:33.228 --> 01:11:35.261
Would you say
it's a good marriage?

01:11:35.263 --> 01:11:38.164
I'm sorry?

01:11:38.166 --> 01:11:39.166
Ah.

01:11:39.168 --> 01:11:40.368
This house has a history

01:11:40.370 --> 01:11:42.802
of bringing out
the worst in people.

01:11:42.804 --> 01:11:46.774
I just wanted make sure
you two are prepared for that.

01:11:46.776 --> 01:11:47.708
Right.

01:11:47.710 --> 01:11:49.176
Well, it, it clearly
needs a lot of work,

01:11:49.178 --> 01:11:51.044
but it's...
it's not that bad.

01:11:51.046 --> 01:11:52.779
I'm sure we'll manage.

01:11:52.781 --> 01:11:54.114
You never really know
until you start

01:11:54.116 --> 01:11:56.150
tearing a place up,
though.

01:11:56.152 --> 01:11:57.885
Uh-hmm.

01:11:57.887 --> 01:12:00.154
Well, thank you for your
concern, really, uh,

01:12:00.156 --> 01:12:02.288
but Don and I have been
through much worse,

01:12:02.290 --> 01:12:04.628
so we'll be fine.

01:12:34.456 --> 01:12:37.227
I am not creeped out
by this house one bit.

01:12:38.161 --> 01:12:41.965
I am in complete control
of my emotions.

01:12:43.098 --> 01:12:44.934
Just like Beyonce.

01:12:55.344 --> 01:12:57.714
Oh, Christ.

01:13:33.215 --> 01:13:35.419
Fuck this.

01:14:07.482 --> 01:14:09.182
Hi.

01:14:09.184 --> 01:14:10.720
I'm worried.

01:14:21.330 --> 01:14:23.500
My husband is a fuck-up.

01:14:25.000 --> 01:14:26.333
Well, you're not the first
woman to say that

01:14:26.335 --> 01:14:27.935
about her husband.

01:14:27.937 --> 01:14:29.171
No.

01:14:30.205 --> 01:14:33.342
I don't mean he, uh,
leaves the toilet seat up.

01:14:36.278 --> 01:14:38.247
He, um...

01:14:40.215 --> 01:14:42.382
he defrauded his clients

01:14:42.384 --> 01:14:45.151
out of their
retirement funds.

01:14:45.153 --> 01:14:49.123
He barely avoided fifteen years
in a federal prison.

01:14:49.125 --> 01:14:50.990
He cheated on me

01:14:50.992 --> 01:14:53.894
while I was trying
to get pregnant,

01:14:53.896 --> 01:14:57.064
and then he insists
that buying this house

01:14:57.066 --> 01:14:59.936
was our second chance,
so, yeah.

01:15:00.836 --> 01:15:02.272
So why'd you stay?

01:15:05.907 --> 01:15:08.441
The alternatives
seemed worse.

01:15:08.443 --> 01:15:11.311
Life is a series
of choices.

01:15:11.313 --> 01:15:13.614
Cause and effect.

01:15:13.616 --> 01:15:16.617
Sounds like Don hasn't
learned that dynamic yet.

01:15:16.619 --> 01:15:18.485
I'm just scared.

01:15:18.487 --> 01:15:20.053
Oh, I'm scared
he's drinking again.

01:15:20.055 --> 01:15:22.125
He's probably drunk
right now.

01:15:23.425 --> 01:15:27.026
I think this house just
pushed him right over the edge.

01:15:27.028 --> 01:15:29.999
This house has a habit
of testing men.

01:15:30.532 --> 01:15:31.865
I've met families
who have lived there

01:15:31.867 --> 01:15:34.635
happily for years
and others

01:15:34.637 --> 01:15:37.171
who never make it a home.

01:15:37.173 --> 01:15:40.173
The difference seems to
come down to the character

01:15:40.175 --> 01:15:43.077
and determination
of the people moving in.

01:15:43.079 --> 01:15:45.115
Well, we're screwed, then.

01:15:46.648 --> 01:15:48.184
So what's the plan?

01:15:49.117 --> 01:15:51.017
I don't know.
Wait for him to come home,

01:15:51.019 --> 01:15:52.388
sober up.

01:15:53.555 --> 01:15:56.927
And then have a long,
honest talk about our future.

01:15:57.994 --> 01:16:00.197
You're a brave woman, Liz.

01:16:01.129 --> 01:16:03.263
You want my advice?

01:16:03.265 --> 01:16:04.465
Get your husband
and your baby

01:16:04.467 --> 01:16:06.836
far away from that house.

01:16:48.009 --> 01:16:49.512
Uh, excuse me?

01:16:52.013 --> 01:16:53.315
Don?

01:16:56.419 --> 01:16:58.252
Don?

01:16:58.254 --> 01:16:59.990
Jesus.

01:17:03.960 --> 01:17:05.159
Welcome home.

01:17:05.161 --> 01:17:06.961
What the fuck
is going on here?

01:17:06.963 --> 01:17:08.162
A party.

01:17:08.164 --> 01:17:10.631
Where is my husband?

01:17:10.633 --> 01:17:12.466
Upstairs, I think.

01:17:12.468 --> 01:17:14.400
Cocktail?

01:17:14.402 --> 01:17:16.138
Fuck off.

01:17:17.473 --> 01:17:18.675
Don?

01:17:23.679 --> 01:17:25.282
Don!

01:17:35.223 --> 01:17:36.625
Don!

01:17:42.464 --> 01:17:44.166
Joining?

01:17:45.433 --> 01:17:47.070
No.

01:17:48.304 --> 01:17:49.569
Don?

01:17:49.571 --> 01:17:51.105
The show's already started.

01:17:51.107 --> 01:17:52.709
Go upstairs.

01:19:15.357 --> 01:19:17.093
Don?!

01:19:18.360 --> 01:19:20.030
Don!

01:19:58.134 --> 01:19:59.702
Oh.

01:20:21.656 --> 01:20:23.157
Stop!

01:20:23.159 --> 01:20:24.561
Stop!

01:20:41.242 --> 01:20:42.879
Is the show over already?

01:20:59.661 --> 01:21:01.763
That's my girl.

01:21:39.802 --> 01:21:41.568
The male performers
wore costumes

01:21:41.570 --> 01:21:43.369
because the owner
felt the mix of erotic

01:21:43.371 --> 01:21:45.674
and grotesque heightened
the experience.

01:21:46.407 --> 01:21:47.873
He was right.

01:21:47.875 --> 01:21:50.245
We were popular,
and the money flowed in.

01:21:50.745 --> 01:21:52.945
Some nights,
we'd work until dawn.

01:21:52.947 --> 01:21:55.649
It was too busy
to keep an eye on everyone.

01:21:55.651 --> 01:21:57.320
Even the innocent ones.

01:21:57.987 --> 01:22:00.290
Even the not-so-innocent.

01:22:03.392 --> 01:22:05.859
He played with her for months
and then killed her,

01:22:05.861 --> 01:22:07.627
dumping her body
at the train tracks,

01:22:07.629 --> 01:22:09.395
and the world moved on.

01:22:09.397 --> 01:22:12.735
Well, some of the world did.

01:22:14.737 --> 01:22:17.971
When he killed me,
my body never left the house.

01:22:17.973 --> 01:22:19.840
I was a star,

01:22:19.842 --> 01:22:23.010
loved by the men who
came through our doors,

01:22:23.012 --> 01:22:25.948
but not one of them
questioned my disappearance.

01:22:27.650 --> 01:22:31.454
All men really love
is the power you give them.

01:23:15.563 --> 01:23:17.432
Don.

01:23:18.866 --> 01:23:21.670
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.

01:23:26.407 --> 01:23:28.510
I'm so sorry.

01:23:30.446 --> 01:23:32.381
I couldn't get them all.

01:23:33.715 --> 01:23:36.048
Don, baby?

01:23:36.050 --> 01:23:38.553
What happened to you?
What happened?

01:23:39.888 --> 01:23:41.020
Hey, look, look.

01:23:41.022 --> 01:23:42.855
I don't know what the fuck
is going on in this house,

01:23:42.857 --> 01:23:45.592
but we got to get
out of here right now.

01:23:45.594 --> 01:23:47.430
It's not that easy.

01:23:48.563 --> 01:23:50.465
What does that mean?

01:23:51.532 --> 01:23:52.966
Bunny, I fucked up again.

01:23:52.968 --> 01:23:55.435
What does that mean,
Don?

01:23:55.437 --> 01:23:58.538
I just...
I felt so small.

01:23:58.540 --> 01:24:00.977
I just wanted to be
the man one more time.

01:24:02.643 --> 01:24:04.744
You understand that
don't you, Bunny?

01:24:04.746 --> 01:24:07.480
No!

01:24:07.482 --> 01:24:09.449
I don't!

01:24:09.451 --> 01:24:10.717
Bunny!

01:24:10.719 --> 01:24:12.052
I promise I can change.

01:24:12.054 --> 01:24:14.788
I promise it'll be different.
Bunny, look at me.

01:24:14.790 --> 01:24:18.758
Bunny, you just have to say
that you understand

01:24:18.760 --> 01:24:19.860
and that it's okay.

01:24:19.862 --> 01:24:21.595
Please.

01:24:21.597 --> 01:24:25.034
It's not okay!

01:24:29.437 --> 01:24:31.106
I can change, Liz!

01:24:56.432 --> 01:24:57.565
I'm proud of you, Liz!

01:24:57.567 --> 01:24:59.969
Thought you weren't gonna
make it there at the end.

01:25:15.517 --> 01:25:17.450
<i>Hey, Liz.</i>

01:25:17.452 --> 01:25:18.987
<i>Liz!</i>

01:25:59.061 --> 01:26:00.530
Nope!

01:27:04.192 --> 01:27:06.028
<i>You did good.</i>

01:27:07.896 --> 01:27:08.694
I'd offer you some,

01:27:08.696 --> 01:27:10.696
but it isn't the
seventies anymore.

01:27:10.698 --> 01:27:13.233
You knew?

01:27:13.235 --> 01:27:15.101
Yeah,

01:27:15.103 --> 01:27:17.837
I watch this house
and it watches mine.

01:27:17.839 --> 01:27:20.640
Why the fuck
didn't you warn us?

01:27:20.642 --> 01:27:23.275
Life is a series
of choices, Liz.

01:27:23.277 --> 01:27:25.311
You can't talk someone
into doing the right thing

01:27:25.313 --> 01:27:27.146
or the wrong thing.

01:27:27.148 --> 01:27:28.882
I couldn't keep someone
out of this house

01:27:28.884 --> 01:27:31.117
any more than
those girls inside

01:27:31.119 --> 01:27:33.252
could keep someone
out of mine.

01:27:33.254 --> 01:27:36.791
Need to lay the options out
and see what they choose.

01:27:37.358 --> 01:27:39.528
A test.

01:27:40.128 --> 01:27:41.764
Exactly.

01:27:42.863 --> 01:27:45.268
Well, it seems like
a pretty shitty game.

01:27:46.668 --> 01:27:47.969
It is, kiddo.

01:27:48.970 --> 01:27:50.973
But I didn't make the rules.

01:29:21.463 --> 01:29:23.832
Hello, my little angel.

01:29:25.166 --> 01:29:27.303
You don't wanna
sleep at all, do you?

01:29:28.737 --> 01:29:31.007
After your nap,
we're gonna go to the park.

01:29:32.073 --> 01:29:33.075
Would you like that, huh?

01:29:39.246 --> 01:29:40.915
I love you so much.
