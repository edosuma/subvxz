00:20.000 --> 00:24.087
Back in the '70s,
every cop wanted out of the city.

00:24.212 --> 00:28.258
But the only cops allowed to live
outside New York were transit cops.

00:28.383 --> 00:33.096
Because the Transit Authority
was also run by Jersey and Connecticut.

00:33.221 --> 00:35.891
So these guys I knew
at the 37...

00:36.016 --> 00:38.226
they started pulling overtime
at subway stations,

00:38.352 --> 00:42.939
and got the city to declare them
"auxiliary transit cops."

00:43.065 --> 00:47.361
They bought some land in Jersey. Got
some cheap loans from people they knew.

00:47.486 --> 00:50.989
They made themselves a place
where the shit couldn't touch 'em.

00:51.114 --> 00:53.700
That's what they thought anyway.

01:04.878 --> 01:07.214
Every precinct
has its "cop bar",

01:07.339 --> 01:11.259
a private club, all blue,
no civilians.

01:12.469 --> 01:15.806
For the 37,
it was the 4 Aces...

01:15.931 --> 01:19.142
just across the river.

01:31.154 --> 01:33.949
They hired this local hero
to be their sheriff.

01:34.074 --> 01:36.952
A wanna-be who couldn't get on
the force on account of his bad ear.

01:37.077 --> 01:40.497
This Armenian guy,
he's from the other side over there.

01:40.622 --> 01:44.001
He tells her that she's dead. Right?
She's gonna be dead by morning.

01:44.126 --> 01:47.212
- So he drops this box off
at her place, right?
- They call you guys.

01:47.337 --> 01:52.175
- They call Bomb Squad.
- Right. We go in there.
We x-ray it on scene.

01:52.301 --> 01:54.511
- And, uh, we can't see
anything in there.
- Right.

01:55.304 --> 01:59.099
So I cut a little hole in it.
I can see there's something in there.

02:00.642 --> 02:03.562
I, uh, I see that there's, uh,
some white fuzz.

02:03.687 --> 02:05.647
There's something pink.
I can't figure out what it is.

02:05.772 --> 02:09.401
- Suddenly I realize
I am looking at a tongue.
- Ah, shit!

02:09.526 --> 02:12.571
A big, fat tongue
sticking out at me. Yes.
The guy put a goat's head in there.

02:12.696 --> 02:15.032
This at the end
of the twentieth century.

02:15.157 --> 02:19.244
H.G. Wells, he'd turn over in
his grave to think at the start
of a new millennium...

02:19.369 --> 02:22.289
- some Iranian guy...
- Armenian. Armenian guy.

02:22.414 --> 02:25.417
Some Armenian would be
deliverin' a goat's head to the
door of the woman that he loved.

02:25.542 --> 02:29.629
- Backward culture over there.
- Let me tell you.
We're all backwards, Berta.

02:29.755 --> 02:32.716
- Our machines are all modern
and shit, but our minds?
- Gary.

02:32.841 --> 02:35.927
Our minds are primitive.
Our minds are primitive, Berta.

02:36.053 --> 02:39.097
- Hey.
- I gotta go home, baby.

02:39.222 --> 02:43.268
All right, wait. I'm just waitin'
on the call, okay? Come here.

02:43.393 --> 02:47.105
- I gotta pick up the car.
This is not...
- Monica, sit down.

02:47.230 --> 02:49.316
You have no authority.

02:51.735 --> 02:54.446
You have no authority.

02:54.571 --> 02:56.823
Yeah, yeah. Fine.

03:04.331 --> 03:06.291
It's quiet tonight,
huh, Freddy?

03:09.586 --> 03:11.129
It's quiet.

03:12.714 --> 03:15.676
Everyone's at that
bachelor party across the river.

03:15.801 --> 03:17.678
Hey, Figgsy,
you got any quarters?

03:17.803 --> 03:21.056
Hey, hey, how you doin'?
Sorry, Freddy. Hey.

03:23.308 --> 03:26.520
I was wondering if
you'd be able to, uh, come by.

03:26.645 --> 03:29.690
Yeah. 4 Aces.
Where else?

03:34.820 --> 03:36.697
Shit!

03:37.906 --> 03:39.783
Damn it.

03:51.044 --> 03:53.422
Two kinds of people
in this world.

03:53.547 --> 03:55.882
Pinball people
and video game people.

03:56.008 --> 03:59.261
You, Freddy,
you're pinball people.

04:00.887 --> 04:03.056
Always got somethin'
to say, Figgsy.

04:03.181 --> 04:05.183
Come on. Freddy,
Freddy, Freddy.

04:05.309 --> 04:08.395
Freddy! Freddy!
Come on.

04:08.520 --> 04:11.231
Come on. Come on.
Come on.

04:13.692 --> 04:16.570
It's bedtime, Sheriff.

04:16.695 --> 04:18.947
You all right to drive?

04:19.072 --> 04:21.742
- You sure?
- Positive.

04:23.076 --> 04:26.705
- Take it easy, Freddy.
- Take it easy.

04:31.043 --> 04:33.712
It was not Lady Luck that
Jim Maloney found in Atlantic City.

04:33.837 --> 04:35.714
It was the cops.

04:35.839 --> 04:39.009
The 30-year-old native
of the Caribbean island of Antigua...

04:39.134 --> 04:42.596
was captured in a casino just days
after an inspiring rap artist...

04:42.721 --> 04:45.891
was fatally beaten
in a Queen's convenience store.

04:46.016 --> 04:48.727
Sources have filled in some
of the blanks for 1010 WINS saying...

04:48.852 --> 04:51.271
Shit!

05:12.751 --> 05:16.088
Oh! All right.
Take it easy, take it easy.

05:16.213 --> 05:18.799
I apologize.

05:19.883 --> 05:22.594
Magilla-gorilla,
you fucking ape.

05:22.719 --> 05:25.847
- Mikey, I'm out.
I'm gettin' outta here.
- Where're you goin'?

05:25.973 --> 05:29.518
- I love her.
- Yeah! Hell of a party!

05:31.353 --> 05:34.648
- Roger.
- Okay, Superboy.
You're my man, Superboy.

05:34.773 --> 05:36.775
- My man, Roger.
- Keep it up.

05:36.900 --> 05:42.155
You guys take it easy. Davey, can you
disclose your fist legally please?

05:42.280 --> 05:44.199
I don't like
bachelor parties.

05:44.324 --> 05:46.493
See you back
in Jersey.

06:01.633 --> 06:03.635
Shit!

06:20.027 --> 06:22.404
Goddamn it!

06:36.835 --> 06:40.756
Ah, fuck!

06:46.762 --> 06:49.222
Shit!

06:51.642 --> 06:54.561
You have to fuck out
all the stuff here. Ah, Jesus!

06:54.686 --> 06:56.563
Frankie?

06:56.688 --> 07:00.442
Jesus Christ! What are you
guys doin'? You're giving me
a heart attack over here.

07:00.567 --> 07:02.402
Hey, Superboy,
what'd ya say, kid?

07:02.527 --> 07:04.571
- You all right, Jackie?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

07:04.696 --> 07:08.867
Yeah? All right,
I'll see you guys tomorrow, man.
You're like creepers back here.

07:08.992 --> 07:12.120
Thanks, kid.
Be careful driving, huh?

07:37.187 --> 07:41.066
Giants leading 10 to 6
as they move to the bottom
of the seventh inning...

07:41.191 --> 07:43.568
in a game characterized
by big rallies.

07:43.694 --> 07:45.779
The Giants scored seven times
in the first inning off...

07:54.746 --> 07:58.750
- Well, fuck!
- The Yankees lost to the Angels today.

08:02.629 --> 08:04.506
Hey!

08:04.631 --> 08:08.010
Pull over. N.Y.P.D.
Pull over!

08:12.097 --> 08:14.474
Hey, you hear me?
Pull over!

08:16.393 --> 08:18.854
No!

08:27.612 --> 08:29.781
Fuck! Shit!

08:39.707 --> 08:41.668
Fuck, cocksucker!

09:16.453 --> 09:18.705
Freddy?

09:33.887 --> 09:36.056
Traffic incident?
Bullshit!

09:36.181 --> 09:38.725
Hey, what's up, man?
These guys were shot like six times.

09:38.850 --> 09:41.645
Hey, just shut up,
do your fucking job!

09:41.770 --> 09:43.897
- Fucking nurse.
- What've you got?

09:44.022 --> 09:47.359
I got four vials of crack here
and a pipe. That's it.

09:47.484 --> 09:49.444
Russell, what you're thinking,
swallow it.

09:49.569 --> 09:51.571
The guy saved five babies
out in Redhook, all right?

09:51.697 --> 09:55.534
That's right. Black babies,
mashed potatoes don't mean gravy.

09:57.744 --> 10:00.247
- I'm on the bridge.
- Is Babitch there?

10:00.372 --> 10:03.166
- Yeah. I see him.
- Take care of it.

10:04.543 --> 10:09.214
Uncle Ray? Uncle Ray, I saw a gun.

10:09.339 --> 10:12.092
I saw the gun. He took a shot at me.
Tell 'em. They took a shot at me.

10:12.217 --> 10:14.094
Stay here with us.

10:14.219 --> 10:16.930
Tunney didn't even get
the grand jury for shit like this.

10:17.055 --> 10:19.766
Fuck the G.J. You're Superboy, huh?
You saved, what?

10:19.891 --> 10:22.686
Six black babies?
Come on, kid, the shit plays!

10:22.811 --> 10:24.688
- Three babies.
- Hey, one at a time, please.

10:24.813 --> 10:29.484
I got P.A. On another channel,
the mayor's office, assistant D.A.

10:29.609 --> 10:31.945
Press up the yin-yang.
The only reason they're not here now...

10:32.070 --> 10:34.740
is we got gridlock from
across Bronx to the Palisades.

10:34.865 --> 10:36.742
There's no gun.

10:39.411 --> 10:42.122
You didn't see it, Jack?
You can't find it?

10:42.247 --> 10:45.459
- Flaky.
- Listen, I heard a shot.
I heard a shot, Ray.

10:45.584 --> 10:47.461
- I heard a shot. I saw a gun.
- In my trunk, in the grand union bag.

10:47.586 --> 10:51.256
- I heard a shot, Leo.
- The kid had a steering wheel
lock in his hand.

10:51.381 --> 10:53.925
Your tyre blew.

10:54.051 --> 10:56.637
You fucked up.
And you wasted a pair of shit-bags...

10:56.762 --> 10:58.680
who aren't worth the hair
in the crack of your ass.

10:58.805 --> 11:01.433
So you cool it
with the patty-cake morality.

11:01.558 --> 11:04.353
Because without me, kid,
those stiffs'll put you in a room...

11:04.478 --> 11:07.356
- where you will fuck your uncle
and everything he's built.
- Hey, Leo.

11:07.481 --> 11:10.525
The black van's gonna be here
in a minute and I haven't done shit!

11:10.651 --> 11:13.153
- What I'm doing is highly...
- Sympathetic.

11:13.278 --> 11:14.821
- Yeah, damn right.
- It is.

11:14.946 --> 11:17.491
- Ray, we don't have to do this.
- Calm down.

11:17.616 --> 11:19.159
Fuck, Ray!

11:38.178 --> 11:40.180
Ooh, baby!

11:40.305 --> 11:42.182
Hey, we got it.

11:42.307 --> 11:45.519
- Look at that, huh? We got it!
- Yo, yo, yo, yo.

11:45.644 --> 11:48.981
- What the fuck are you doin', man?
- I found their piece.

11:49.106 --> 11:50.983
- Found their piece?
- Ah, Jesus!

11:51.108 --> 11:54.152
- That wasn't in there.
- What do you mean it wasn't in?
It was underneath the floor mat.

11:54.277 --> 11:56.196
Bullshit, man. You can't do that!
Shut the fuck up!

11:56.321 --> 11:58.156
Do what? It was underneath
the fucking floor mat.

11:58.281 --> 12:00.867
What the fuck are you doing?
Fuck you!

12:00.993 --> 12:03.704
I told you not to do it
like this, Ray.

12:03.829 --> 12:07.332
- We're just doin' our job,
so let's just calm down.
- I told you!

12:07.457 --> 12:09.501
Take it easy. Hey!

12:09.626 --> 12:12.170
You boys should take care
of your own business here.

12:12.296 --> 12:14.881
Take my fucking shield
away from me.

12:15.007 --> 12:17.676
- Hey, put it down!
- What? You gonna shoot me?

12:17.801 --> 12:21.388
- Put it down, Chico!
- Chico this, motherfucker!

12:21.513 --> 12:25.684
- Frankie, help me start it up.
- What the fuck you gonna do?

12:27.519 --> 12:29.688
Kiss my ass!

12:33.859 --> 12:35.527
Fuck!

12:37.821 --> 12:41.241
Hey, Jack, Jack, Jack.

12:41.366 --> 12:43.243
Oh, my God!

12:43.368 --> 12:46.747
Oh, my God! Leo!

12:46.872 --> 12:49.750
Leo! Jesus!
He jumped!

12:51.209 --> 12:54.463
Oh, my God!
He jumped!

12:56.381 --> 12:58.967
- He jumped!
- Murray?

13:01.720 --> 13:04.139
Somebody shine a light
down there.

13:07.142 --> 13:10.687
He just hit the water
and... he went down.

13:10.812 --> 13:12.689
- Davis? Where's Davis?
- Oh!

13:12.814 --> 13:16.026
- I want aviation, harbour.
I want some illumination now!
- Stupid, fucking kid!

13:16.151 --> 13:18.612
- Oh, my God!
- We got a man over the fucking G.W.!

13:43.053 --> 13:45.806
How long is the car
gonna take?

13:45.931 --> 13:49.393
Lenny won't know
till the parts guy gets in.

13:49.518 --> 13:51.853
You should take
number two.

13:51.979 --> 13:54.648
What did you tell Lenny
about the accident?

13:54.773 --> 13:58.151
- Chasin' a speeder.
- What?

13:58.276 --> 14:01.029
Sheriff was chasin'
a speeder.

14:12.958 --> 14:15.335
Our top story on 1010 WINS:

14:15.460 --> 14:19.131
A fatal shootout on the G.W.B.
And a cop's suicide.

14:19.256 --> 14:24.136
Highway Patrol continues searching the
Hudson River for the body of Officer...

14:24.261 --> 14:26.179
Murray "Superboy" Babitch.

14:26.305 --> 14:28.432
- Babitch leaped off the George
Washington bridge last night,
- Hey, hey, put it out.

14:28.557 --> 14:33.270
- An apparent suicide, after
engaging in a high-speed chase.
- Fuck you, arsehole.

14:33.395 --> 14:35.647
There's no way
that guy jumped, man.

14:35.772 --> 14:39.735
- There's no fucking way!
- Controversy swirls around events
on the bridge.

14:39.860 --> 14:42.863
Officer, how can you testify...

14:42.988 --> 14:47.242
that Superboy jumped off that bridge
when you didn't see him jump?

14:47.367 --> 14:50.579
I mean, I'm looking
at your statement right here...

14:50.704 --> 14:53.498
that you filled out
at 0200 hours.

14:53.623 --> 14:56.168
Wait a minute. I'm gonna object
because we went through this.

14:56.293 --> 14:58.712
Now, he's been up all night.

14:58.837 --> 15:01.590
How many times are you gonna ask
the same question?

15:04.676 --> 15:07.721
Let me ask you another
question, brother.

15:11.642 --> 15:14.186
Have you ever been
to Garrison, New Jersey?

15:14.311 --> 15:17.689
- What kind of question
is that, Lieutenant?
- Counsellor.

15:17.814 --> 15:20.442
Have you ever been
to Garrison, New Jersey?

15:20.567 --> 15:24.738
- You think those white boys
on that bridge...
- Come on, Lieutenant.

15:24.863 --> 15:26.865
- Please. I object to this!
- What do you think this is, Mod Squad?

15:26.990 --> 15:29.868
I'm offended by this.

15:29.993 --> 15:32.454
All right, all right!
All right, listen.

15:32.579 --> 15:36.583
He doesn't tell us what we want
to know, he's gonna lose his job.

15:36.708 --> 15:41.088
That's about as simple
as I can make it. He's gonna lose
his fuckin' job. All right?

15:41.213 --> 15:43.256
Do you want that?

15:43.382 --> 15:45.968
What do you take us for?
A bunch of fuckin' morons, huh?

15:46.093 --> 15:49.054
- What is the matter with you?
- With all due respect, I think...

15:49.179 --> 15:52.641
- You be quiet, you be quiet!
Shut up!
- I believe...

15:52.766 --> 15:56.144
If you don't mind my French,
all right? You be quiet.

15:56.269 --> 16:00.232
He's off the force if he
does not start answering questions.

16:00.357 --> 16:03.110
You want to save your ass?
Start giving us answers.

16:03.235 --> 16:05.445
And I'll tell you something.
We know anyway.

16:05.570 --> 16:09.491
So do yourself a favour,
and stop fuckin' around.

16:29.136 --> 16:31.013
It's Grotto.

17:06.298 --> 17:09.550
- Murray, get down.
- It's Freddy's new girl.

17:09.675 --> 17:12.804
Cover yourself.

17:12.929 --> 17:17.184
- Hi. Could you turn
your engine off for me?
- I got the air on.

17:17.309 --> 17:19.310
- You on the job?
- No.

17:19.435 --> 17:22.230
We're comin' from Forest Hills.
I'm John McEnroe. That's Jimmy Connors.

17:22.356 --> 17:24.858
Is your licence in there?
Can you pull it out for me, please?

17:24.983 --> 17:27.361
- This is a school zone.
- Christ!

17:27.486 --> 17:30.364
Listen, Miss Betts.
You're new, right?

17:30.489 --> 17:33.659
Yes, I'm new here,
but I'm not new on the job.

17:33.784 --> 17:35.869
- I was...
- Freddy!

17:35.994 --> 17:38.205
- A municipal deputy in Elmira.
- Freddy!

17:38.330 --> 17:41.208
You see, Officer, in Garrison...

17:41.333 --> 17:45.212
when the car you're gonna tag
has got a P.D.A. sticker...

17:45.337 --> 17:49.466
I'd advise you to think to yourself,
"Hey, that's one of the good guys.

17:49.591 --> 17:51.551
I think I'll go catch me
a bad guy."

17:51.677 --> 17:54.763
If we didn't pull over P.D., there
wouldn't be any violations in this town.

17:54.888 --> 17:58.183
The problem in this town
ain't the people that live here.
It's the element that visits.

17:58.308 --> 18:02.187
Is this a new car, Ray?
It's nice. We didn't recognize it.

18:02.312 --> 18:04.022
Come on, Freddy, I wanna go home.
Tell this cupcake to heel.

18:04.147 --> 18:05.941
- Okay, that's not necessary.
- Cindy.

18:08.527 --> 18:10.904
- Well, listen, take care, guys.
See you later.
- Hey!

18:11.029 --> 18:16.034
- What happened to you, Freddy?
- Fender benders.

18:16.159 --> 18:19.454
She's kinda cute.

18:41.101 --> 18:44.938
Dispatch. Hi!

18:45.063 --> 18:47.441
Can I call you back?
Bye.

18:47.566 --> 18:50.944
- You okay?
- Yeah, I'm fine. I got it.

18:58.285 --> 18:59.995
Dispatch.

19:00.120 --> 19:03.123
No, no. That's the next town over.
You called Garrison.

19:03.248 --> 19:05.334
Right. The town
with all the police.

19:44.956 --> 19:48.043
What are you gonna do with Superboy?
You gotta stash him someplace.

19:48.126 --> 19:50.045
We lie low.

19:59.763 --> 20:01.640
Hey, Moe!

20:03.600 --> 20:05.477
Hey, Ray.

20:09.648 --> 20:13.360
- Sorry to hear about your nephew.
- Yeah, he was a good kid.

20:13.485 --> 20:16.530
We were up all night
with it.

20:17.823 --> 20:20.158
I know you need
to talk to me.

20:20.283 --> 20:23.537
I'll come in next week
sometime. How's that?

20:23.662 --> 20:27.874
- Jackie here's comin' in
early for you. Tomorrow.
- Hi, Jackie. Moe Tilden.

20:28.000 --> 20:30.127
Yeah, hey.

20:30.252 --> 20:32.212
- Moe Tilden.
- Yeah. Frankie Lagonda.

20:32.337 --> 20:34.339
- What house?
- Out of the 37.

20:34.464 --> 20:37.801
- You been there long?
- Maybe too long, huh?

20:37.926 --> 20:41.596
- Too long. Right.
- Moe, here, was my classmate
at the academy.

20:41.722 --> 20:44.891
Back in the day...

20:45.017 --> 20:49.438
before he fell in love with this
redhead at I.A. And transferred.

20:49.563 --> 20:51.773
Is that how it went, Ray?

20:54.067 --> 20:57.571
So what brings you to our fair city?
Checkin' up on us?

20:57.696 --> 21:00.240
I heard there was
a way of life out here.

21:00.365 --> 21:02.909
Thought I'd check it out
for myself.

21:04.036 --> 21:07.456
What are we, uh,
like the Amish now?

21:16.965 --> 21:19.468
See you around.

21:23.055 --> 21:25.307
You fuckin' rat.

21:41.406 --> 21:43.784
Ah, shit!

22:04.596 --> 22:07.015
I thought you gave me a ticket.

22:07.140 --> 22:09.810
You the sheriff?

22:09.935 --> 22:12.479
- I thought you gave me a ticket.
- One second.

22:15.649 --> 22:19.403
Hey, hey, Gordon, that's it.
Knock it off. Let him go.

22:19.528 --> 22:22.280
- Arsehole!
- Just let him go.
Everyone go down to the park.

22:22.406 --> 22:25.325
Go on. Go on
before I kick your ass.

22:25.450 --> 22:29.162
Get on!
Sorry.

22:29.287 --> 22:31.540
How long
you been a sheriff?

22:31.665 --> 22:35.002
- Ten years.
- That's great.

22:35.127 --> 22:37.671
I see there's a lot
of city cops here.

22:37.796 --> 22:39.965
- Oh, yeah. A lot of cops.
- Great gig.

22:40.090 --> 22:41.967
I like it.

22:44.011 --> 22:47.681
Well, I don't wanna waste your time.
Let me give you my card.

22:49.224 --> 22:51.351
It's a special unit
in the city.

22:51.476 --> 22:54.521
If you ever wanna talk about anything,
it's all confidential.

22:56.648 --> 22:58.358
Okay.

22:58.483 --> 23:01.361
Nice to meet ya.

23:06.158 --> 23:09.661
Ray, that fuck Tilden
shows up here with that grin.

23:09.786 --> 23:14.041
Freddy's new girl
pulls us over.

23:14.166 --> 23:19.755
I mean, someone's talkin'.
I say it's Figgis.

23:21.131 --> 23:23.091
I mean,
we got some loose ends.

23:29.556 --> 23:32.559
I'm sorry. Oh.

23:32.684 --> 23:35.395
- Jesus, I'm sorry.
- Oh, it's okay. I heard voices.

23:35.520 --> 23:38.565
I was gonna have the base
call you back anyway.

23:38.690 --> 23:42.444
Freddy! Look what you found.

23:42.569 --> 23:45.364
She's gonna be so happy. Her daddy
won it for her at the fair last year.

23:45.489 --> 23:48.367
- And I left it on top of the car.
- I know. I saw from my window.

23:48.492 --> 23:51.953
It's awful
about Ray's nephew.

23:52.079 --> 23:54.039
Mmm.

23:54.164 --> 23:56.249
What happened
to your nose?

23:56.375 --> 23:58.877
Ah, little accident.
I was chasing a speeder.

23:59.002 --> 24:01.421
Mommy, I need some black!

24:01.546 --> 24:04.091
Oh, shh.

24:04.216 --> 24:07.469
Look what the sheriff found. Remember
how you were crying for that today?

24:07.594 --> 24:10.263
Freddy, do you want
some coffee?

24:10.389 --> 24:13.517
Um, no, I'm fine.
Thanks, Liz.

24:13.642 --> 24:16.687
- I got a little bit on me.
- Yeah, you got a
little bit on you, didn't you?

24:16.812 --> 24:20.107
Come here. Okay.
All right. You know what?

24:20.232 --> 24:23.068
I have to get something
to clean this off of you.

24:23.193 --> 24:25.445
Okay. We got it off
both hands.

24:25.570 --> 24:29.616
Isn't that nice?
I'm gonna go get a washcloth. Okay?

24:29.741 --> 24:32.995
All right. You just draw a rainbow.
Enough with the sparkles.

24:33.120 --> 24:34.997
I'll be right back.

24:35.122 --> 24:37.291
All right?

24:40.877 --> 24:42.796
Well.

24:42.921 --> 24:45.799
I was gonna call you.

24:45.924 --> 24:48.135
Not you.
One of your guys.

24:48.260 --> 24:50.679
Why? What's up?

24:50.804 --> 24:54.349
Someone's been dumping garbage,
garbage bags.

24:54.474 --> 24:57.311
Is that them?

24:57.436 --> 25:00.856
Just one of them.
The rest are mine.

25:00.981 --> 25:03.692
I don't tell Joey, 'cause then he
thinks he's got to deal with it.

25:03.817 --> 25:06.528
Not that he doesn't think much
of the local... about you guys.

25:06.653 --> 25:08.822
I'll take care of it.
It's okay.

25:08.947 --> 25:10.991
He's got the city
to worry about, right?

25:13.744 --> 25:15.662
Anyway...

25:25.464 --> 25:27.591
What's the point
with the black garbage bag?

25:27.716 --> 25:32.304
It's just I found
your phone bill in a black
garbage bag down the street.

25:32.429 --> 25:35.849
So, what if I said I didn't know
where it came from?

25:35.974 --> 25:38.393
I'd take your word
for it, Rose.

25:38.518 --> 25:41.855
- Is Ray home?
- No. He's taking care
of our little visitor.

25:45.025 --> 25:48.070
- My garbage gets picked up
every Tuesday.
- All right.

25:48.195 --> 25:51.073
Well, thanks for your time,
Rose.

25:51.198 --> 25:54.618
You tell Joey that he should
come and talk to me...

25:54.743 --> 25:56.912
if he thinks
I got no right.

25:57.037 --> 26:02.542
Rose, I wanna believe you
when you tell me something.
Did you dump these bags or not?

26:02.668 --> 26:04.586
Freddy, this isn't
a law problem. Okay?

26:04.711 --> 26:08.715
You tell Joey Randone
if he does not like my garbage,

26:08.840 --> 26:11.593
well, then, he should stop
soiling my sheets.

26:13.845 --> 26:17.224
You gonna tell Ray
about this?

26:31.613 --> 26:34.116
- Hey, Ray.
- What's up, Freddy?

26:36.368 --> 26:39.705
- Decided to give me that ticket?
- No.

26:39.830 --> 26:43.917
- Somebody's been dumping garbage.
- Oh... a felony!

26:46.086 --> 26:50.424
- What's wrong, Officer?
- Could I see your licence
and registration, please?

26:50.549 --> 26:53.260
- I was just asking...
- We just came to get
a view of the city.

26:53.385 --> 26:57.264
- I don't believe this.
- It'll be all right.

26:57.389 --> 27:00.642
They're just a couple over.
I'm checking docs.

27:00.767 --> 27:04.646
- I'll sit.
- I roger that.

27:44.102 --> 27:47.981
- This ass motherfucking pig.
- We came here to watch the view!

27:48.106 --> 27:49.983
- And you pull this?
- Speeding? My ass! Goddamn.

27:50.108 --> 27:54.988
Do you know the meaning
of the word harassment?
That's what this is, you know.

27:56.948 --> 27:59.660
- It was Rose, wasn't it?
- Liz,

27:59.785 --> 28:03.497
if you want me to,
I'll talk to 'im.

28:03.622 --> 28:06.959
Ah, why?

28:07.084 --> 28:09.044
You didn't marry him.

28:09.169 --> 28:11.964
No.

28:12.089 --> 28:14.591
But I'm your friend.

28:14.716 --> 28:17.636
Freddy, look, I gotta go.

28:17.761 --> 28:19.596
And let me be clear.

28:20.430 --> 28:24.351
It was the system that drove Murray
"Superboy" Babitch off that bridge.

28:24.476 --> 28:27.854
Murray Babitch was a hero cop.

28:27.980 --> 28:32.567
He deserved a fair hearing, but he knew
this would not happen, not in this city.

28:32.693 --> 28:35.654
Activist Cyril Johns
met the parents of the slain teens,

28:35.779 --> 28:38.991
calling for a human blockade
on the bridge tomorrow.

28:39.116 --> 28:43.537
A drunk cop jumps off a bridge.
That does not erase the murder
of two black children.

28:43.662 --> 28:46.290
Attending the Yankee game,
Mayor Farelli responded to reports...

28:46.415 --> 28:49.543
- of cops attempting to plant
evidence on the bridge.
- Shh. Shh.

28:49.668 --> 28:52.379
We are looking into it. There may have
been some irregularity on the bridge.

28:52.504 --> 28:54.381
- But as I say...
- Your mother's an irregularity.

28:54.506 --> 28:57.926
No more comments, please.
I'm here to enjoy the ball game
with my wife. Thank you.

28:58.051 --> 29:02.264
Oh, that's your boss.
Are you kidding?

29:02.389 --> 29:05.600
- You'll never get
another raise in your life.
- Who's gonna tell?

29:12.190 --> 29:14.401
Diagonal rule.

29:14.526 --> 29:18.322
Diagonal rule. Red light, don't fight.
You make a right.

29:18.447 --> 29:20.282
It's more important
than the golden rule.

29:20.407 --> 29:23.410
- If Superboy knew that,
he'd still be alive, Freddy.
- Yo! Yo, yo.

29:23.535 --> 29:27.664
Freddy, I heard you saved
Ollie the turtle today.

29:27.789 --> 29:32.210
- What happened to your nose?
- Ah, nothing.
I just had a little accident.

29:32.336 --> 29:35.088
Listen, Joey, there's something
we should probably talk about
if you've got some time.

29:35.213 --> 29:37.716
- What?
- Something we should...
If you have a few minutes.

29:37.841 --> 29:40.802
Pretty boy Joey
bettin' against the Bulls.

29:40.927 --> 29:42.804
What is that? What, are you
some kind of high roller?

29:42.929 --> 29:46.266
- Fuck you, Figgs. I had 12 points.
- Against the 5-time NBA champs?

29:46.391 --> 29:48.560
What kind of bet is that?
You know, you night guys,

29:48.685 --> 29:51.104
you watch way too much Oprah when
you should be catching your "Z's."

29:51.229 --> 29:54.691
Uh-huh, Figgs, well at least
I'm not the one sniffin' my money away.

29:54.816 --> 29:57.277
That was your inner child
making that wager, Joey.

29:57.402 --> 29:59.905
Little boy Joey with the little
Met poster taped above his bed.

30:00.030 --> 30:02.949
Tell you what, Figgs,
why don't you do me a favour.

30:03.075 --> 30:06.953
Come on over here, unzip me, pull out
my inner child and take a bite, baby.

30:07.079 --> 30:08.914
Bite it hard
and bite it thick.

30:09.039 --> 30:12.793
- Fuck you!
- No, fuck you!

30:12.918 --> 30:16.505
Don't fuck like that, P.D.
How's that make you feel, Freddy?

30:17.756 --> 30:19.800
I don't care.

30:19.925 --> 30:22.302
Yeah?
You like eatin' doughnuts?

30:23.971 --> 30:26.640
Look, Freddy.
I say it's okay to be jealous.

30:28.266 --> 30:30.143
You saved this girl's life,
right?

30:30.268 --> 30:33.855
From it, from risking yourself
from saving her sorry ass,
you go deaf as a result.

30:33.981 --> 30:35.857
- In one ear.
- In one ear.

30:35.983 --> 30:38.902
Then you have to watch as this girl
you saved, this beauty queen,

30:39.027 --> 30:41.363
marries this cocksucker!

30:41.488 --> 30:44.324
And you, with your ear, you can't
even get a desk on the force.

30:44.449 --> 30:46.702
You're fucked.

30:46.827 --> 30:48.745
Be jealous, Freddy!

30:48.870 --> 30:50.831
Let it out.
I would.

30:50.956 --> 30:55.502
Purge! Cleanse yourself.
Fucking cleansing.

30:59.631 --> 31:02.301
Del, Del, let me have
another beer.

31:02.426 --> 31:04.803
I gotta go, Freddy.

31:04.928 --> 31:07.681
School's in session.
See you later.

31:10.767 --> 31:13.020
He bets against the Bulls.

31:18.483 --> 31:23.196
No one wants to get
involved in your personal life, Gary.

31:23.322 --> 31:27.826
But just because you're
undercover now, that don't mean
people aren't watchin' you.

31:27.951 --> 31:30.537
Wh-What's going on here?
This is fucking bullshit.

31:30.662 --> 31:34.082
This is bullshit.
What is this, omerta? Huh?

31:34.207 --> 31:36.209
Listen, if I.A.'s gonna
fucking hang me by the balls,

31:36.335 --> 31:38.503
it ain't gonna be over
some fucking missing evidence.

31:38.629 --> 31:41.548
Figgsy, you've been a cop
12 years. Six grams missing.

31:41.673 --> 31:43.925
It's not a white socks
violation, babe.

31:44.051 --> 31:48.263
Come on! You bought that big
ol' house. Maybe you're tryin'
to get out from under.

31:48.388 --> 31:51.933
- Hey! Jack.
- What the fuck's up your ass?

31:52.059 --> 31:54.394
You're telling me you're gettin'
by without gravy, any of you?

31:54.519 --> 31:57.397
Listen to me.
I was putting out Ray's fires
when you were still suckin'...

31:57.522 --> 32:01.068
on your mama's titties, so just
back the fuck off, all right?

32:01.193 --> 32:03.111
So you want to toss me?
What? You can't...

32:03.236 --> 32:05.572
- Sit down, Gary.
- No! Tell me what's going on!

32:05.697 --> 32:08.742
- This is bullshit!
- Even better, why don't you
get the fuck out?

32:08.867 --> 32:13.038
Fuck you, you fucking child.
Just back the fuck off.

32:13.163 --> 32:16.458
At least I'm not shackin'
with no reekin' whore.

32:16.583 --> 32:19.086
You're supposed to fuck 'em, Gary,
not open up a methadone clinic.

32:24.049 --> 32:26.426
- Figgis, get the hell off of me!
- Hey, hey, hey!

32:26.551 --> 32:28.428
Hey, Figgis, come on.

32:28.553 --> 32:31.431
That's too much now.
Hey, hey, hey!

32:31.556 --> 32:33.767
- Gary.
- Fuck you.

32:33.892 --> 32:38.438
You got a problem with me
helpin' a girl in trouble, huh?

32:38.563 --> 32:40.065
- Figgsy.
- You have a problem with that?

32:40.190 --> 32:42.025
- Huh?
- No, you're a fuckin' humanitarian!

32:42.150 --> 32:45.404
- Come here, come here. You think
you're so fuckin' bad, huh?
- Oh, God!

32:45.529 --> 32:47.864
Come on. Come here.
You see this?

32:47.990 --> 32:49.866
Look at Tunney.
You see him?

32:49.992 --> 32:52.995
- That was my fuckin' partner.
That was a cop!
- Enough!

32:53.120 --> 32:55.414
Let go of him, Figgsy.

32:58.292 --> 33:00.335
Go home.

33:04.631 --> 33:06.591
You all right, Jack?

33:06.717 --> 33:09.553
Don't shut me out, Ray!

33:09.678 --> 33:14.266
You found us a sweet
little town. You got us the
low interest, and I'm grateful.

33:14.391 --> 33:18.437
But don't forget who it was that you
came to two years ago to cover your ass.

33:18.562 --> 33:20.939
Get him outta here, Freddy.

33:21.064 --> 33:24.484
- Come on.
- It's not my fault
that you can't look at him!

33:24.609 --> 33:26.486
You sit in this chair...

33:26.611 --> 33:28.572
with your back to 'im.

33:28.697 --> 33:30.824
You want it to go away,
but I'm still here.

33:30.949 --> 33:33.994
In for a penny, in for a pound.

33:35.746 --> 33:37.623
Don't shut me out, Ray.

33:45.380 --> 33:47.799
I'll take care of it,
Ray.

33:47.924 --> 33:51.178
It's bullshit. I'm gettin'
the fuck outta this town!

33:55.182 --> 33:58.644
- Open the door.
- You wanna play games?
I don't play games.

33:58.769 --> 34:02.356
I want the door op...
I want... I want...

34:04.107 --> 34:07.694
Open it now!

34:07.819 --> 34:13.074
- Shut up!
- Why don't you go up the street
and get into bed with Rosie?

34:13.199 --> 34:17.411
- Please open the goddamn door now!
- Idiot!

34:17.536 --> 34:20.165
Open it... now!

34:22.042 --> 34:27.172
Freddy, go home. Everything is just
hunky-dory. Please go.

34:30.634 --> 34:33.553
- Mind if we check up on Liz?
- Yes, I do. I mind.

34:36.181 --> 34:38.684
I said I mind, Freddy.

34:40.226 --> 34:42.353
- Joey, I've had it, okay?
- I'll get the kit.

34:42.478 --> 34:45.690
Liz, it's Freddy.

34:45.815 --> 34:47.442
Does Ray know?

34:47.567 --> 34:50.737
Freddy, does Ray know?

34:53.991 --> 34:56.743
- Hi, Freddy.
- Are you okay?

35:01.039 --> 35:04.209
Your Uncle Freddy is here
to rescue you again.

35:11.717 --> 35:15.053
Liz, maybe you and the baby need
a place to stay. Let him cool off.

35:15.178 --> 35:18.098
I could take you over to the Ramada.
Do you want me to do that?

35:18.223 --> 35:22.477
He didn't do anything.
I... hit him with a bottle.

35:24.604 --> 35:28.025
When I lost you, honey

35:28.150 --> 35:33.947
Sometimes I think
I lost my guts too

35:39.202 --> 35:42.956
Yeah, I wish that
I could send you word

35:43.081 --> 35:47.961
Send me something
I'm afraid

36:55.612 --> 36:59.866
Freddy?

36:59.992 --> 37:02.035
Freddy!

37:13.338 --> 37:15.841
His girlfriend
was in the basement.

37:15.966 --> 37:19.803
- So where is Figgs?
- I called him at the precinct.
He's on his way.

37:21.013 --> 37:23.724
Oh.

37:36.820 --> 37:40.574
We got no pressure. We can steal
water from that tower over there.

37:44.161 --> 37:46.038
Monica, can you hear me?

37:46.163 --> 37:48.040
Oh, my God!

37:48.165 --> 37:50.626
Oh, my God!
Monica!

37:51.710 --> 37:55.005
Baby, what were
you doin' in there?

37:55.130 --> 38:00.719
Hey! I came back
to see you.

38:00.844 --> 38:04.056
I need...
I needed some...

38:05.390 --> 38:08.727
Wanted...
to see you,

38:08.852 --> 38:12.564
but you weren't there.

38:12.689 --> 38:16.568
I was workin'.
I was workin'.

38:20.822 --> 38:23.450
Monica!
No, baby.

38:34.086 --> 38:36.088
Oh, my God.

39:06.994 --> 39:09.997
- The fucker's gettin' payback.
- Who is?

39:10.122 --> 39:12.040
Ray. Who do you think?

39:12.165 --> 39:14.501
Lenny said it wasn't suspicious.
He said it was electrical.

39:32.519 --> 39:34.396
Figgsy?

39:34.521 --> 39:37.232
Look at me, Figgsy.

39:48.869 --> 39:51.246
Did you call in?

39:55.000 --> 39:58.253
I'm not on till Tuesday.

40:05.344 --> 40:07.387
I'll call in.
Buy you a couple weeks.

40:25.197 --> 40:28.158
In a cemetery
practically reserved for cops,

40:28.283 --> 40:31.244
we come across the tombstone
of Officer Glenn Tunney.

40:31.370 --> 40:35.832
You may recall his case.
He was murdered in his jail cell
awaiting the grand jury.

40:35.958 --> 40:38.001
Two years later,
deja vu.

40:38.126 --> 40:42.047
Another hero cop, Murray Babitch
is his name, dubbed Superboy,

40:42.172 --> 40:44.466
unwilling to trust the system
that destroyed his friend,

40:44.591 --> 40:46.468
jumped from
the George Washington Bridge.

40:50.055 --> 40:51.932
- Freddy.
- How ya doin'?

40:53.058 --> 40:55.602
Freddy.

40:55.727 --> 40:58.981
Maybe we should
go up there.

41:00.983 --> 41:03.735
Freddy. Freddy?

41:05.404 --> 41:08.448
I want you to meet the head of
the Patrolman's Defence Association.

41:08.573 --> 41:11.118
Great.

41:11.243 --> 41:13.120
Vincent.

41:13.245 --> 41:17.791
Vincent Lassaro, I'd like you
to meet Sheriff Freddy Heflin.

41:17.916 --> 41:20.752
- You did a good job here.
You did a great job. Real nice.
- Thank you.

41:20.877 --> 41:23.338
- Freddy's a hell of a guy.
- Good, great.

41:23.463 --> 41:27.301
He was trying to get on the force,
but he had this problem with his ear.

41:27.426 --> 41:29.678
- You're not a lip reader, are ya?
- No, no.

41:29.803 --> 41:31.972
It's just this one ear when
I was a kid I had this accident.

41:32.097 --> 41:35.517
You should call me. I mean, when
Ray Donlan puts his thumb in the air...

41:35.642 --> 41:38.812
It's not the force, but I got
my own people. Call me.

41:40.314 --> 41:42.190
Is he serious?

41:42.316 --> 41:45.360
Freddy, my boy,
that is how things happen.

41:45.485 --> 41:47.863
See you later.

41:50.115 --> 41:53.910
"Eternal God, our Father,
the Lord of our life and death,

41:54.036 --> 41:58.290
we acknowledge Thee in all our ways
and in all events which befall us."

41:58.415 --> 42:02.002
What's in the coffin?

42:02.127 --> 42:04.129
His uniform.

42:04.254 --> 42:09.259
"Then in Thy great mercy, grant us
a safe lodging and a holy rest.

42:09.384 --> 42:13.680
And peace at last
through Jesus Christ, our Lord."

42:13.805 --> 42:15.682
Amen.

42:15.807 --> 42:19.061
Unto God's gracious mercy
and protection, we commit you.

42:19.186 --> 42:21.647
The Lord bless you
and keep you.

42:21.772 --> 42:26.860
The Lord make His face to shine
upon you, and be gracious unto you.

42:26.985 --> 42:30.697
The Lord lift up His countenance
upon you and give you peace...

42:30.822 --> 42:33.575
both now and forevermore.

42:33.700 --> 42:35.827
Amen.

42:56.890 --> 42:59.059
Hi, Sheriff.
How you doin'?

42:59.184 --> 43:01.061
How you doin'?

43:01.186 --> 43:04.147
This is Detective Carson.

43:04.272 --> 43:07.442
- How's it goin'?
- Come on in. It's your office.

43:12.656 --> 43:17.244
That there is Manny Cardoza
and his brother. They're drug runners.

43:21.832 --> 43:26.545
I didn't know they allowed
classical music in Jersey.

43:29.047 --> 43:30.966
Who's this?

43:31.091 --> 43:34.136
Toy Torillo.
You heard of him?

43:34.261 --> 43:36.972
Oh, yes.

43:37.097 --> 43:40.100
I don't know how you do it,
Sheriff.

43:40.225 --> 43:43.228
Keeping all these Hessians
in line.

43:43.353 --> 43:47.149
All blue. Everybody packing.
All together.

43:47.274 --> 43:49.568
One door
down from the next.

43:49.693 --> 43:52.112
The wives borrowing
the sugar.

43:52.237 --> 43:54.156
It's like you're the sheriff
of Copland.

43:54.281 --> 43:56.575
Look at this.

44:12.591 --> 44:15.636
You see, Sheriff,
I got a sticky problem.

44:15.761 --> 44:20.641
My jurisdiction ends, in a sense,
at the George Washington Bridge.

44:22.267 --> 44:26.480
But half the men I watch
live beyond that bridge...

44:26.605 --> 44:28.482
where no one's watching.

44:28.607 --> 44:30.150
I'm watching.

44:30.275 --> 44:32.653
I can see that. You've got
a crime rate here of about, what?

44:32.778 --> 44:34.821
The lowest
in northern New Jersey.

44:34.946 --> 44:38.158
You got Hoboken and Jersey City
over here. Newark.

44:38.283 --> 44:40.786
We try to do a good job
with what we have.

44:40.911 --> 44:42.996
With a staff of three?
No, Sheriff.

44:43.121 --> 44:45.832
What you got is a town that scares
the shit out of certain people.

44:45.958 --> 44:48.585
Lieutenant, I told you,
I'm watching.

44:48.710 --> 44:53.173
I mean, if you look around you see none
of these people are wearing silk shirts.

44:53.298 --> 44:56.385
Their pools are above ground.
You know?

44:56.510 --> 45:00.722
You raise your family somewhere decent,
I guess that's a crime now.

45:05.644 --> 45:07.896
Lieutenant, look around.

45:08.021 --> 45:13.527
This is a town with a population
of 1,000 people and maybe 30
families are cops. That's it.

45:13.652 --> 45:16.905
- I got news for you.
Not all cops are dirty.
- I'm not saying they are.

45:26.832 --> 45:31.420
Sheriff, I went to the
same academy as our friend out there.

45:31.545 --> 45:34.172
- Who, Ray?
- Yeah. He was a beauty.

45:34.298 --> 45:37.217
He was a real collar man.

45:37.342 --> 45:40.053
But I don't know. Something
happened to him along the way.

45:46.310 --> 45:50.022
You mind if I sit down?

45:50.147 --> 45:53.900
We buried a suit today.

45:54.026 --> 45:56.778
We buried a suit today!

45:59.114 --> 46:01.700
That doesn't bother you?

46:01.825 --> 46:06.622
- He jumped off the G.W.B.
- Yeah, but his body
never hit the water.

46:08.040 --> 46:10.250
That doesn't bother you.

46:11.918 --> 46:14.796
What does?
That I investigate cops?

46:14.921 --> 46:18.258
- Being a man who always pined
to be a cop?
- I am a cop.

46:18.383 --> 46:20.761
Pined to be N.Y.P.D.

46:20.886 --> 46:23.930
Three, four absences...
ten years.

46:24.056 --> 46:26.933
Appeals of hearing tests.
Right?

46:28.560 --> 46:32.939
You may be law enforcement,
and so am I, but you are not a cop.

46:35.734 --> 46:37.903
Now, I may watch cops.

46:38.028 --> 46:40.113
But tell me if I'm wrong.

46:40.238 --> 46:42.741
Every day out these windows,
so do you.

46:42.866 --> 46:45.202
You watch cops too.

46:45.327 --> 46:48.622
And since we are both law enforcement,
we share a duty.

46:48.747 --> 46:51.083
Do we not?

46:51.208 --> 46:54.127
If there is a stink,
we must investigate.

46:54.252 --> 46:57.756
We must gather evidence because
evidence makes us see the truth.

46:57.881 --> 47:00.634
Is this the stink
of a criminal act...

47:00.759 --> 47:03.804
or is it a turd
in the bag?

47:03.929 --> 47:07.307
Babitch isn't dead.
You know that and I know that.

47:07.432 --> 47:10.477
Ray got him
off that bridge alive...

47:10.602 --> 47:12.479
before he could talk.

47:12.604 --> 47:16.525
But he wasn't so lucky the last time
when the shit hit the fan with Tunney.

47:16.650 --> 47:20.529
That boy he took care of later.
But now what?

47:20.654 --> 47:23.657
What does Ray do now?
That's the $64,000 question.

47:23.782 --> 47:25.826
And that's why I'm here.

47:25.951 --> 47:28.078
That's why I'm here,
Sheriff.

47:28.203 --> 47:30.998
Because you're
on the inside.

47:31.123 --> 47:33.208
And besides the church traffic,
and the cats in the trees...

47:33.333 --> 47:35.669
and all that other bullshit,
okay,

47:35.794 --> 47:40.048
there isn't much here for you
to do to keep your mind busy.

47:40.173 --> 47:42.592
But I look at you, Sheriff,

47:42.718 --> 47:46.638
and I see a man who's waiting
for something to do.

47:46.763 --> 47:50.183
And here I am.

47:50.309 --> 47:53.478
Here I am saying, "Sheriff,

47:53.603 --> 47:57.065
I got something for you to do."

47:57.190 --> 48:01.236
- I don't wanna
go through this again.
- It's too fucking bad.

48:01.361 --> 48:05.449
I can't!
I told the boys...

48:05.574 --> 48:08.201
I mean, they're downstairs now
saying goodbye.

48:08.327 --> 48:12.664
- Ray, how many people you got
at this party? The whole 37?
- You got a party downstairs.

48:12.789 --> 48:17.169
Here I am scrambling, cleaning
this thing up for you, and
you're throwing a fuckin' party.

48:17.294 --> 48:21.882
The mayor's gonna suspend this case.
I'm making it happen tomorrow!

48:22.007 --> 48:26.678
But sooner or later, Ray,
they gotta find the body in
that river or it will not hold.

48:26.803 --> 48:31.433
Mets, it's
my sister-in-law's kid!

48:31.558 --> 48:33.727
Didn't you say
he was adopted?

48:33.852 --> 48:36.938
What's up, Freddy?

48:39.399 --> 48:42.903
Ray, this doesn't make things
very easy for me. I mean...

48:43.028 --> 48:47.532
This is a pretty big thing you're having
here the day after. How do you think...

48:47.658 --> 48:50.410
Freddy, what
are you talking about?

48:50.535 --> 48:54.373
This guy came to see me yesterday,
this Moe Tilden from I.A.

48:54.498 --> 48:56.708
- He brought all these pictures and...
- Freddy.

48:56.833 --> 49:01.088
That guy's had a hard-on for me
for years. It's a personal thing.

49:01.213 --> 49:03.423
- He is a scumbag.
- All right.

49:03.548 --> 49:08.011
You know how they recruit at I.A.D.?
They catch you on the take.

49:08.136 --> 49:11.765
And they tell you you can either
do time or join 'em.

49:11.890 --> 49:16.895
Well, he knows you know
Superboy is...

49:17.020 --> 49:20.607
I told him he was dead, Ray.
I told him he was wrong about you, but...

49:20.732 --> 49:24.695
I'm the sheriff. I mean,
I'm supposed to know what's goin' on.

49:26.571 --> 49:28.573
How do you think
this looks?

49:28.699 --> 49:32.327
Go home, Freddy...
and don't think so much.

49:32.452 --> 49:35.580
- Ray, I can't go.
- Freddy...

49:35.706 --> 49:39.751
- Freddy, go home. Go home. Go home.
- I can't go...

49:50.929 --> 49:53.140
Yo, Ross, come over here.
Look at this.

49:54.766 --> 49:56.643
Super!

50:00.022 --> 50:03.942
It's not Murray. It's not Murray.
He's part of a search.

50:04.067 --> 50:07.321
- In Tempe, Arizona.
- Atlanta, Georgia. Atlanta, Georgia.

50:12.701 --> 50:16.997
Murray, Murray.
Listen.

50:17.122 --> 50:20.000
- I want you to have this.
- No, no, Aunt Rose, I'm fine.
Seriously. I gotta go...

50:20.125 --> 50:23.629
Look, Murray, look.
Listen to me.

50:23.754 --> 50:25.964
I want you
to have this.

50:26.089 --> 50:28.550
All right, all right.
You made it for me?

50:29.635 --> 50:31.595
- Yeah.
- Thank you.

50:31.720 --> 50:33.889
- Okay.
- Thank you.

50:43.857 --> 50:45.692
Hi.

50:45.817 --> 50:47.736
Hi.

50:50.989 --> 50:53.200
You guys have
another fight?

50:53.325 --> 50:56.536
We were supposed to have
a big talk.

50:58.997 --> 51:01.541
So I sent Caroline
over to my mom's.

51:01.667 --> 51:04.920
And, um,

51:05.045 --> 51:07.673
and Joey called and told me
that he was stuck,

51:07.798 --> 51:10.550
and that he made
some arrest.

51:11.718 --> 51:13.720
I mean, l...

51:13.845 --> 51:18.600
I can't believe him
when he tells me... anything.

51:20.394 --> 51:23.063
Liz, you wanna
come inside?

51:28.318 --> 51:32.739
I met a little girl
and I settled down

51:32.864 --> 51:36.952
You can get this on CD,
you know... in stereo.

51:37.077 --> 51:40.455
It wouldn't matter
to me.

51:40.580 --> 51:42.791
Oh, right.

51:46.169 --> 51:49.589
We got married

51:49.715 --> 51:53.593
You know, it's a funny thing
when you owe someone your life.

51:53.719 --> 51:56.888
Then little by little

51:57.014 --> 52:01.393
We drifted
from each other's arms

52:04.062 --> 52:08.233
Why is it
you never got married, Freddy?

52:08.358 --> 52:10.944
It was just restlessness

52:15.073 --> 52:17.784
All the best girls
were taken.

52:22.414 --> 52:29.463
And it was somethin' more
I guess

52:29.588 --> 52:36.178
That tore us apart
and made us weep

52:38.347 --> 52:42.100
I'm drivin' a stolen car

52:43.101 --> 52:45.979
Down on Eldridge Avenue

52:47.314 --> 52:51.109
Each night I wait
to get caught

52:52.527 --> 52:55.072
But I never do

53:03.246 --> 53:07.292
- This is crazy.
- Yes.

53:20.055 --> 53:21.348
All right, take it easy.
All right?

53:21.473 --> 53:24.518
All right, Gabriel,
take it easy.

53:43.829 --> 53:46.206
Murray?

53:46.331 --> 53:48.208
Hey, Murray!

53:48.333 --> 53:51.211
Ray's outside
waitin' for ya.

53:52.546 --> 53:56.049
- You comin' or what?
- I'm comin', I'm comin'.

54:22.492 --> 54:26.079
That was
a great party, Ray.

54:31.752 --> 54:34.963
You know, Ray,
it's a really great thing you did.

54:35.088 --> 54:37.466
Makin' a place where everybody
could stick together.

54:39.217 --> 54:41.637
I mean...

54:41.762 --> 54:45.307
you know I know you didn't
have to do this for me.

54:45.432 --> 54:48.268
You could've just...

54:48.393 --> 54:51.772
I just... I wanna let you know
I appreciate it.

54:51.897 --> 54:53.607
I really do.

54:53.732 --> 54:55.734
- Everyone's gone.
- Just us, buddy.

54:55.859 --> 54:58.111
That's it.

54:58.236 --> 55:02.282
I always said to my mom,
"Uncle Ray doesn't like me, but..."

55:02.407 --> 55:05.452
I always liked you,
Murray.

55:05.577 --> 55:07.829
You just sweat
too much.

55:07.955 --> 55:11.416
- Hey, what's doin'?
- Hey, Superboy.

55:11.541 --> 55:15.295
So what are we gonna do now?
I'm gonna go meet some people?

55:15.420 --> 55:19.800
How does this work? I've got all
my bags packed and everything, Ray.

55:19.925 --> 55:25.472
Just I'm a little buzzed.
You know, maybe we could
do this tomorrow or something.

55:25.597 --> 55:28.642
I'm really tired, Ray.

55:28.767 --> 55:30.936
- Where's Joey?
- He's working tonight, kid.

55:31.061 --> 55:32.896
Yeah?

55:33.021 --> 55:35.482
Sorry it came out this way,
Murray.

55:35.607 --> 55:37.859
Ah, it's not that bad, Jack.

55:40.112 --> 55:42.823
Yeah, it is, Murray.

56:04.177 --> 56:08.140
- Fuck!
- What the fuck
is going on here?

56:08.265 --> 56:11.852
What is this? What are you doin'?
What are you doin', huh?

56:11.977 --> 56:14.146
- Stay outta this.
- What the fuck is this?

56:14.271 --> 56:17.774
Ray, you said P.D.A. was gonna
set him up with a new life.

56:17.899 --> 56:20.569
You think I'm all that,
Joey?

56:48.347 --> 56:50.265
Ah, fuck.

56:58.732 --> 57:01.401
Put your files in there.
We're done.

57:01.526 --> 57:03.403
It's over.

57:04.988 --> 57:06.949
- Moe...
- We were shut down
by the mayor. Here.

57:07.074 --> 57:10.744
- What the fuck is this?
- Put your files in there.
The case is closed.

57:10.869 --> 57:12.996
Reuben, what are you doin'?
What are you doin'?

57:13.121 --> 57:15.582
- I'm on hold with the phone company.
- Is that the Garrison file?

57:15.707 --> 57:20.045
Is that a Garrison file?
Give me your Garrison files.
Give me the Garrison files.

57:20.170 --> 57:22.089
- Give me it all. Give me it all.
- All right, all right.

57:22.214 --> 57:24.925
Is that more? I'll take everything.
The case is closed.

57:25.050 --> 57:28.428
The case is fucking closed!

57:28.553 --> 57:29.930
Closed!

57:34.059 --> 57:36.311
The case is closed, finished,
over!

57:36.436 --> 57:37.980
- Go to lunch.
- I, uh...

57:38.105 --> 57:40.440
Go to lunch!

57:40.565 --> 57:42.818
Go!
Hey, go to lunch.

57:42.943 --> 57:47.114
Go to lunch! The case is closed.
Everybody, get the fuck outta here.

57:47.239 --> 57:49.616
Get outta here!
The case is fucking closed!

57:56.748 --> 57:59.543
With community leaders
and pundits crying "Cover up,"

57:59.668 --> 58:03.130
Mayor Farelli's suspension of
the Babitch case is a big gamble...

58:03.255 --> 58:05.132
for his upcoming
reelection campaign.

58:05.257 --> 58:08.218
The decision, however, has scored
big points with the cop vote...

58:08.343 --> 58:10.637
which the mayor
has depended upon in the past.

58:12.264 --> 58:14.141
What do you want?

58:14.266 --> 58:16.977
Are you gonna help us
or not?

58:17.102 --> 58:21.231
Help you help what?
Help Ray here find him?

58:21.356 --> 58:23.650
Help Ray finish cleaning up
his goddamn pool with the guy's head?

58:23.775 --> 58:26.445
Is that it?
Huh, Mr Humanitarian?

58:26.570 --> 58:28.155
You got something
you wanna say to me, Ray?

58:28.280 --> 58:30.866
Or is this about something
a little more personal?

58:32.993 --> 58:35.495
I'm on at 10:00.
I'm outta here.

58:35.621 --> 58:37.998
We all are.
We got another hour.

58:38.123 --> 58:40.167
Hey, come on, Joey.

58:51.303 --> 58:54.514
Instead of taking cop lessons
from a cokehead,

58:54.640 --> 58:57.517
maybe you should be lookin'
at that fire, you know?

58:57.643 --> 59:01.396
My girl over at Chase says Figgs
is missing a few payments.

59:01.521 --> 59:03.523
Where were you that night,
Jack?

59:07.361 --> 59:10.030
I had nothin' to do
with it.

59:10.155 --> 59:14.201
That would be retribution.
And that I leave to God Almighty.

59:14.326 --> 59:16.912
I'm Gandhi.

59:17.037 --> 59:20.540
I'm tellin' ya,
the mob built this town for Ray...

59:20.666 --> 59:25.045
so they could own
a fuckin' precinct.

59:25.170 --> 59:27.381
It's a deep and dark
motherfuck.

59:30.676 --> 59:32.719
What you're feelin'
right now, Freddy,

59:32.844 --> 59:36.390
friendless, angry,
nervous, misunderstood,

59:36.515 --> 59:39.101
this is it,
this is the life.

59:39.226 --> 59:42.104
You're lucky your ear
kept you off the force.

59:44.439 --> 59:47.067
You know...

59:47.192 --> 59:51.029
if I saw Liz...

59:51.154 --> 59:53.573
drowning in the water...

59:53.699 --> 59:56.076
If I saw that today,

59:57.703 --> 59:59.579
I wouldn't go in.

59:59.705 --> 01:00:03.792
I'd stand there,
and I'd think about it.

01:00:06.044 --> 01:00:09.256
And that's the best thing
I ever did with my life.

01:00:09.381 --> 01:00:12.384
- So?
- So?

01:00:12.509 --> 01:00:16.263
So you wanna sit around your whole life
wishing you were on the force?

01:00:16.388 --> 01:00:20.642
Or do you wanna bring the faggot in?
Let him spill.

01:00:22.728 --> 01:00:25.814
I wouldn't know where
to begin.

01:00:25.939 --> 01:00:28.734
All right.
Brother's in deep shit.

01:00:28.859 --> 01:00:32.779
He's down, he's bleeding,
and you gotta get there.

01:00:32.904 --> 01:00:36.325
But there's lights, right?
All over the city, red lights.

01:00:36.450 --> 01:00:38.952
You go through
the red lights.

01:00:39.077 --> 01:00:42.414
Sure, you fire up the roof,
you wail, you go through
the red lights, but that's slow,

01:00:42.539 --> 01:00:44.583
fighting your way
through traffic.

01:00:44.708 --> 01:00:46.585
The goal is
perpetual motion.

01:00:46.710 --> 01:00:48.795
You move diagonal.

01:00:48.920 --> 01:00:51.632
You turn the wheel
when you hit a red light.

01:00:51.757 --> 01:00:54.134
You don't drive down Broadway
to get to Broadway.

01:00:54.259 --> 01:00:56.303
But how does this apply to what
you were saying in there?

01:00:56.428 --> 01:00:58.513
It applies, Freddy!

01:00:58.639 --> 01:01:01.808
It's just as easy to tail a man
walking in front of him.

01:01:01.933 --> 01:01:05.604
Now, you butt heads with these
friends of ours, you're gonna
come at them head-on?

01:01:05.729 --> 01:01:08.815
- Okay.
- They got lives, Freddy.

01:01:08.940 --> 01:01:10.859
Families.

01:01:13.445 --> 01:01:15.322
No.

01:01:15.447 --> 01:01:17.783
You move diagonal.

01:01:17.908 --> 01:01:20.243
You jag.

01:01:20.369 --> 01:01:23.664
Ah, Christ!
Where the fuck are you guys?

01:01:23.789 --> 01:01:26.333
Stay cool, Tom,
we're on our way. I need you to wait.

01:01:26.458 --> 01:01:29.503
I'm down. But, but Joey,
he's tryin' to hold on,

01:01:29.628 --> 01:01:32.130
but this big bastard,
he cut me up.

01:01:32.255 --> 01:01:34.549
Stay cool, Tom.
I need your location.

01:01:34.675 --> 01:01:38.053
- Agh! He's a fucking monster!
- I need your location!

01:01:38.178 --> 01:01:41.223
- I need an assist.
- I can't move.
I think he cut my tendon.

01:01:47.437 --> 01:01:52.651
You got a wife, huh?
Huh? You got a baby?

01:01:52.776 --> 01:01:55.445
Quit!
Tell me you quit.

01:01:55.570 --> 01:01:57.614
I'll let you go.
You go home.

01:01:57.739 --> 01:02:01.743
Kiss your wife.
Eat your baby's Fruit Loops and shit.

01:02:01.868 --> 01:02:05.330
Belt me, motherfucker,
you're gonna be redeemed.

01:02:05.455 --> 01:02:07.332
Re-re-redeemed,

01:02:07.457 --> 01:02:11.545
Officer... Randone.

01:02:27.019 --> 01:02:28.895
Shit!

01:02:29.021 --> 01:02:31.273
- Motherfucker!
- Shit.

01:02:37.529 --> 01:02:40.866
It's the roof, Jack.
You got units sent in.

01:02:40.991 --> 01:02:44.244
All right,
I'll check the front.

01:02:49.541 --> 01:02:51.418
Come on, come on.

01:02:53.545 --> 01:02:55.255
Son of a bitch!

01:02:59.176 --> 01:03:01.261
Please.

01:03:17.527 --> 01:03:20.572
Help! Help!

01:03:22.699 --> 01:03:25.452
No! No! No!

01:03:34.544 --> 01:03:36.964
In here!

01:03:44.888 --> 01:03:47.307
Joey's in trouble,
Ray.

01:03:47.432 --> 01:03:50.519
Ray, let's just break
the fuckin' thing down.

01:03:53.021 --> 01:03:54.982
Got it.

01:04:34.604 --> 01:04:38.358
His father is serving
a life sentence for murder,
murdering an ex-girlfriend...

01:04:38.483 --> 01:04:40.736
with a sawed-off shotgun back in 1988.

01:04:40.861 --> 01:04:44.031
The New York Times is quoting
one friend of Royster saying...

01:04:44.156 --> 01:04:46.658
that the guy had
an I.Q. Of 160.

01:04:54.166 --> 01:04:56.293
I need your help.

01:04:57.502 --> 01:04:59.379
They're tryin'
to kill me.

01:04:59.504 --> 01:05:01.340
- Who?
- Who?

01:05:01.465 --> 01:05:03.884
My friends tried to kill me.
Ray Donlan...

01:05:04.009 --> 01:05:06.011
tried to kill me.

01:05:06.136 --> 01:05:08.388
Shit!

01:05:08.513 --> 01:05:10.390
Holy shit!

01:05:10.515 --> 01:05:12.434
Speak of the devil!

01:05:28.533 --> 01:05:30.452
Freddy, forget it.

01:05:39.920 --> 01:05:42.381
I don't get this.

01:05:42.506 --> 01:05:45.258
This doesn't make
any sense.

01:05:45.384 --> 01:05:47.344
Why'd they get Superboy
off the bridge,

01:05:47.469 --> 01:05:50.055
bring him back here
and kill him?

01:05:50.180 --> 01:05:54.851
Ray had a plan,

01:05:54.977 --> 01:05:57.813
and it got
very fucked up.

01:05:57.938 --> 01:06:03.318
Why didn't Superboy go
to New York to get some help?

01:06:03.443 --> 01:06:06.863
I don't know. He's got
his Aunt Rosie here. I don't know.

01:06:08.323 --> 01:06:10.325
Ray's wired into
the State Police.

01:06:10.450 --> 01:06:12.369
He's got friends
in Internal Affairs.

01:06:12.494 --> 01:06:16.540
If he wants someone dead,
they're dead anywhere.

01:06:38.103 --> 01:06:40.439
You awake, Freddy?

01:06:42.107 --> 01:06:47.154
Aw, I feel like shit.

01:06:48.363 --> 01:06:51.325
Fuckin' allergy
that's killin' me.

01:06:57.331 --> 01:06:59.207
Hey.

01:07:13.889 --> 01:07:17.476
In sure and certain hope
of the resurrection to eternal life,

01:07:17.601 --> 01:07:20.062
through our Lord,
Jesus Christ,

01:07:20.187 --> 01:07:23.023
we commend to Almighty God
our brother Joseph,

01:07:23.148 --> 01:07:25.275
and we commit his body
to the ground.

01:07:25.400 --> 01:07:28.195
The Lord bless him
and keep him.

01:07:28.320 --> 01:07:32.658
The Lord make His face to shine
upon him and be gracious unto him.

01:07:32.783 --> 01:07:37.371
The Lord lift up His countenance
upon him, and give him peace.

01:07:37.496 --> 01:07:41.166
Honour Guard, retreat.

01:07:46.672 --> 01:07:50.759
Hey, Ray.

01:07:54.012 --> 01:07:56.056
Hey, Freddy.

01:07:56.181 --> 01:07:58.225
I came to tell you...

01:07:58.350 --> 01:08:00.644
that Superboy
came to see me, Ray,

01:08:00.769 --> 01:08:03.063
a couple nights ago.

01:08:03.188 --> 01:08:05.941
He's scared.

01:08:06.066 --> 01:08:09.278
He's a fugitive, and he's convinced
you're gonna kill him.

01:08:09.403 --> 01:08:12.322
He's a mixed-up kid.

01:08:12.447 --> 01:08:14.324
So are you.

01:08:14.449 --> 01:08:17.618
Ray, there's gotta be a way
out of this for everyone.

01:08:17.743 --> 01:08:20.788
So, I say why don't we all
go in tomorrow together.

01:08:20.913 --> 01:08:25.836
Freddy,
I invited men,

01:08:25.961 --> 01:08:29.214
cops, good men,

01:08:29.339 --> 01:08:32.134
to live
in this town.

01:08:32.259 --> 01:08:35.970
And these men, to make a living,
they cross that bridge every day...

01:08:36.095 --> 01:08:39.140
to a place where everything
is upside down.

01:08:39.265 --> 01:08:43.145
Where the cop is the perp,
and the perp is the victim.

01:08:43.270 --> 01:08:48.149
The only thing they did
was to get their families out...

01:08:48.274 --> 01:08:51.528
before it got
to them.

01:08:51.653 --> 01:08:53.947
We made a place
where things make sense,

01:08:54.072 --> 01:08:57.326
and you can walk
across the street without fear.

01:08:57.451 --> 01:09:00.953
And you come to me with a plan
to set things right.

01:09:01.078 --> 01:09:05.292
Everyone in this city holding hands,
singing "We Are the World."

01:09:05.417 --> 01:09:08.086
That's very nice.

01:09:08.211 --> 01:09:13.008
But, Freddy, your plan
is the plan of a boy.

01:09:15.926 --> 01:09:19.014
You made it on the back
of a matchbook without thinking!

01:09:20.932 --> 01:09:23.352
Without looking
at the cards.

01:09:25.228 --> 01:09:27.147
I look at the cards.

01:09:27.272 --> 01:09:29.733
I see this town...

01:09:29.858 --> 01:09:32.194
destroyed.

01:09:32.319 --> 01:09:34.696
Now, that's not
what you want, is it?

01:09:36.490 --> 01:09:38.951
I look at this town...

01:09:40.077 --> 01:09:42.328
and I don't like
what I see anymore.

01:09:42.453 --> 01:09:45.374
Who the fuck
do you think you are?

01:10:31.378 --> 01:10:33.672
- No, I don't know.
- What the hell
are you doing?

01:10:33.797 --> 01:10:37.426
- I just, uh...
I got, I got...
- Call you back.

01:10:37.551 --> 01:10:40.304
- Excuse me. I'm sorry.
- Moe, I apologize.
He just walked in here.

01:10:40.429 --> 01:10:43.223
I'm sorry for rushing in
like this, but you were right.

01:10:43.348 --> 01:10:45.726
They tried to kill him like you said,
but he got away.

01:10:45.851 --> 01:10:48.603
Now he's runnin' through
the woods. He's like a scared
animal. He's scared to death.

01:10:48.729 --> 01:10:50.606
That motherfucker
should be scared.

01:10:50.731 --> 01:10:53.317
His uncle got this case closed
with one phone call.

01:10:55.652 --> 01:10:59.781
Look, I'm sorry it took so long
for me to come around,
but you were right.

01:10:59.906 --> 01:11:03.577
I couldn't see the truth.
Like you said, the evidence,
my loyalty, they were confusing.

01:11:03.702 --> 01:11:05.787
They never give you
any napkins in this place.

01:11:07.080 --> 01:11:09.082
What am I
supposed to use?

01:11:09.207 --> 01:11:12.252
You want this?

01:11:12.377 --> 01:11:15.255
What is this?
You came to me, to my town...

01:11:15.380 --> 01:11:17.799
with all these speeches, talking to me
about doing the right thing.

01:11:17.924 --> 01:11:20.385
I'm doing the right thing.
What's goin' on? What are you doing?

01:11:20.510 --> 01:11:23.972
That was like
two weeks ago.

01:11:24.097 --> 01:11:26.516
Two weeks ago?

01:11:31.772 --> 01:11:33.649
What about Babitch?

01:11:33.774 --> 01:11:35.651
What about him?
Fuck him.

01:11:38.111 --> 01:11:41.031
- What about Donlan?
- Fuck him too.

01:11:42.574 --> 01:11:44.368
What about
Joey Randone?

01:11:44.493 --> 01:11:47.663
He fell off a building.
Don't you read the papers?

01:11:49.790 --> 01:11:51.875
Listen, Sheriff,
I'm really sorry...

01:11:52.000 --> 01:11:54.544
to have awoken you from your slumber,
but it's over.

01:11:54.670 --> 01:11:57.005
Hands are tied now.
You shut me down.

01:11:57.130 --> 01:12:00.342
No, listen to me. You're I.A.
That's why I came to you.
You can do whatever you want.

01:12:00.467 --> 01:12:03.428
Remember you came to me, said,
"You wanna be a cop?" I'm bein' a cop.

01:12:03.553 --> 01:12:06.807
- I offered you a chance.
- I'm asking you for some help.
I need to do something.

01:12:06.932 --> 01:12:10.018
- I need to do this for myself.
- Listen, you deaf fuck.
I offered you a chance.

01:12:10.143 --> 01:12:13.021
When we could have done something,
I offered you a chance to be a cop,

01:12:13.146 --> 01:12:15.357
and you blew it!

01:12:15.482 --> 01:12:17.401
You blew it.

01:12:30.330 --> 01:12:32.874
You people
are all the same.

01:12:36.670 --> 01:12:40.007
That cupcake makes a mess,
we got a case again.

01:13:45.989 --> 01:13:49.242
The mob runs millions
in drugs through their precinct,

01:13:49.368 --> 01:13:52.287
and everybody gets
a nice house.

01:13:54.873 --> 01:13:57.834
Figgs is right.
The mob owns this town.

01:14:19.273 --> 01:14:21.483
They closed the case,
Freddy. If they don't have...

01:14:21.608 --> 01:14:25.320
- the stomach for it...
- They had to. It's circumstantial.

01:14:25.445 --> 01:14:27.322
You don't have anything either.

01:14:27.447 --> 01:14:29.992
All that stuff is illegal.
You stole it.

01:14:51.179 --> 01:14:53.348
I know this guy.

01:15:09.406 --> 01:15:12.701
He's a corrections officer.

01:15:30.344 --> 01:15:33.889
They took care of Tunney
when he was gonna talk.

01:15:34.014 --> 01:15:37.184
Then how come Figgis didn't do
somethin' about it? He was
Ray's right-hand man back then.

01:15:37.309 --> 01:15:40.228
Then they tried
to kill Superboy.

01:15:40.354 --> 01:15:43.148
They were hiding him,
Freddy.

01:15:43.273 --> 01:15:47.486
Then they burned down Figgsy's house
when they think he might talk.

01:15:47.611 --> 01:15:50.906
You don't know that.
We went over every inch of that house.

01:15:54.743 --> 01:15:58.538
Not everything is
a hexagonal conspiracy.

01:15:58.664 --> 01:16:01.416
I think you been hangin'
around Figgs too much.

01:16:01.541 --> 01:16:05.712
He's the only one getting cash
out of that house,
and he's totally playing you...

01:16:07.214 --> 01:16:09.591
just like those arseholes
in the city.

01:16:11.176 --> 01:16:15.806
And I'm sorry, but... there's nothing
you can do about this.

01:16:15.931 --> 01:16:19.810
Yes, there is. I can find Superboy
and I can bring him in.

01:16:27.401 --> 01:16:31.446
I'm going back upstate.
I want my old job back.

01:16:31.571 --> 01:16:33.865
I don't want any part
of this.

01:16:33.991 --> 01:16:36.952
I don't want any part
of this place.

01:16:37.077 --> 01:16:39.121
Come on, Cindy.

01:16:42.916 --> 01:16:45.794
Geez.

01:16:47.546 --> 01:16:52.134
Freddy, look, I don't know
about Ray, okay?

01:16:52.259 --> 01:16:55.804
But everyone in Garrison
is not a murderer.

01:16:55.929 --> 01:16:59.683
No. They just keep their eyes closed
and their mouths shut just like me.

01:17:19.286 --> 01:17:20.829
Hey, Freddy.

01:17:28.920 --> 01:17:30.797
All right, thank you.
Thank you.

01:17:30.922 --> 01:17:32.799
Thank you, sweetheart.
I love you too.

01:17:32.924 --> 01:17:34.885
All right,
terrific.

01:18:03.664 --> 01:18:05.540
Two in the centre?

01:18:05.666 --> 01:18:08.293
Uh-uh. No.
Rules are different for cops.

01:18:08.418 --> 01:18:11.922
- I'm losin' my shirt here
with you guys.
- So what do I got to do?

01:18:12.047 --> 01:18:15.425
- Five out of six in the star.
- Five out of six.

01:18:15.550 --> 01:18:18.053
- Hey, Freddy.
- You a cop too?

01:18:18.178 --> 01:18:21.098
Yeah, yeah,
I heard ya.

01:18:21.223 --> 01:18:23.558
Enjoy your trip
to the big city?

01:18:30.983 --> 01:18:33.068
You gotta hit the next five
to win.

01:18:43.370 --> 01:18:44.871
Shit!

01:18:50.210 --> 01:18:52.921
I just hope you're not
trying to prove anything, Freddy.

01:18:53.046 --> 01:18:55.799
I know some of them
are real arseholes.

01:18:55.924 --> 01:18:59.011
You know.
They think they're high priests
or somethin'. I don't know.

01:18:59.136 --> 01:19:02.931
But why would they do all this?
You know, maybe they're doin'
the right thing.

01:19:06.643 --> 01:19:10.105
Liz, I saw these pictures
of Ray meeting with these guys.

01:19:10.230 --> 01:19:12.232
You know, like mobsters.

01:19:12.357 --> 01:19:16.445
- Everyone's houses are financed
by these mob banks.
- Says who? I.A.?

01:19:18.739 --> 01:19:21.283
Even you said Joey's death
was no accident.

01:19:21.408 --> 01:19:24.411
Joey fell off
a building, Freddy! Okay?

01:19:24.536 --> 01:19:28.165
Now, I don't need this opened up.
Maybe you do. I don't.

01:19:28.290 --> 01:19:31.501
All Joey wanted was a place
for us to live.

01:19:31.627 --> 01:19:35.297
Now, who are you to judge that
until you've walked in his shoes?

01:19:35.422 --> 01:19:38.467
Maybe that's what you're tryin'
to do with me.

01:19:49.269 --> 01:19:51.647
What're you gonna do,
Freddy?

01:19:53.690 --> 01:19:56.735
You gonna arrest
the whole town?

01:19:56.860 --> 01:19:59.780
You goin' to New York to take
"paint by number" cop lessons?

01:20:01.114 --> 01:20:03.158
You know, Ray likes you.

01:20:03.283 --> 01:20:06.828
That don't mean
I'm gonna let you fuck him over.

01:20:09.831 --> 01:20:12.417
Ray Donlan
gave you this job, Freddy.

01:20:12.542 --> 01:20:16.171
You forgot that?
We made your sorry ass!

01:20:18.507 --> 01:20:20.968
So now you can do us
a favour, huh?

01:20:21.093 --> 01:20:24.846
You could tell us...
where Superboy is.

01:20:24.972 --> 01:20:28.475
If I knew where he was,
he'd be in the city already.

01:20:33.438 --> 01:20:35.607
You're gonna be hurtin',
Freddy.

01:20:35.732 --> 01:20:38.110
You're not gonna know when,
you're not gonna know where.

01:20:38.235 --> 01:20:40.988
You're gonna be hurtin'.
You mark my words. I'm watchin' you!

01:21:18.859 --> 01:21:21.028
Hey.

01:21:21.153 --> 01:21:24.114
- You got your cheque.
- Yep.

01:21:24.239 --> 01:21:28.702
Thanks to you, Freddy. Filing out
those forms in such a timely fashion.

01:21:32.205 --> 01:21:36.209
You with Liz?

01:21:36.335 --> 01:21:38.587
Where're ya goin'?

01:21:38.712 --> 01:21:41.465
I don't know.

01:21:41.590 --> 01:21:45.427
My leave came, so I thought I'd look
around for a new reality. You know?

01:21:47.429 --> 01:21:49.973
Anyway, I'm sure you
could use your privacy, Freddy.

01:21:55.020 --> 01:21:58.148
No, no.

01:21:58.273 --> 01:22:00.150
No, no.

01:23:17.227 --> 01:23:19.646
Look all you want,
Freddy.

01:23:19.771 --> 01:23:23.275
You're not gonna find
anything.

01:23:23.400 --> 01:23:26.361
I took care of it.

01:23:29.489 --> 01:23:31.992
That lady cop...

01:23:32.117 --> 01:23:35.829
from the Bomb Squad got you the stuff
to do this with, didn't she?

01:23:37.998 --> 01:23:41.501
You didn't know Monica was gonna
be here. Did you, Figgs?

01:23:41.627 --> 01:23:43.629
No.
Monica said...

01:23:43.754 --> 01:23:48.008
she was going over to her friend's
house to watch some pay-per-view.

01:23:48.133 --> 01:23:51.553
The thing was on a timer. I didn't
know she was gonna be here, Freddy.

01:23:53.889 --> 01:23:55.849
It's all bullshit.

01:23:57.726 --> 01:23:59.686
You, Figgs,
are the bullshit!

01:23:59.811 --> 01:24:01.897
Smarten fuckin' up!

01:24:02.022 --> 01:24:04.232
You even turned your back on Tunney
when he needed your help.

01:24:04.358 --> 01:24:07.861
Figgs! I'm gonna find Superboy,
and I'm gonna bring him in.

01:24:07.986 --> 01:24:10.864
And for once, everybody in this town's
gonna tell the truth.

01:24:10.989 --> 01:24:14.117
- You gotta find him first, Freddy!
- I'll find him.

01:24:14.242 --> 01:24:19.748
Listen to me. I got a cheque in
my pocket for $200,000. I got
a chance to start my life again.

01:24:19.873 --> 01:24:22.876
I don't give a shit about this town.
I don't give a shit about that town.

01:24:23.001 --> 01:24:26.421
And I don't give a shit
about your fucking justice.

01:24:26.546 --> 01:24:30.300
Bein' right is not
a bulletproof vest, Freddy.

01:24:32.803 --> 01:24:35.722
Go on, Figgsy, get the hell
out of here. Go on!

01:24:35.847 --> 01:24:37.307
Go on, Figgsy!

01:24:37.432 --> 01:24:40.435
Go on!
Run away!

01:24:58.078 --> 01:24:59.955
Hey, Freddy.

01:25:00.080 --> 01:25:02.582
- Ray's not home.
- I know.

01:25:02.708 --> 01:25:04.960
I'm lookin'
for your nephew.

01:25:06.503 --> 01:25:08.714
I don't know where
he is.

01:25:08.839 --> 01:25:11.591
Why the hell would I tell you
if I did?

01:25:11.717 --> 01:25:15.929
Rose,
I'm his only chance.

01:26:31.922 --> 01:26:34.049
Let's go.

01:26:46.645 --> 01:26:49.564
Shut the fuck up!
Would ya, please?

01:26:49.690 --> 01:26:51.400
Sh... Fuck!

01:27:02.869 --> 01:27:05.247
Yeah.
No, please.

01:27:05.372 --> 01:27:09.251
Who was he
supposed to call?

01:27:09.376 --> 01:27:12.421
Ray knows everybody.

01:27:12.546 --> 01:27:16.049
What am I supposed to do?
Let him go in alone? What?

01:27:16.174 --> 01:27:19.011
You know what?
Okay, fine.

01:27:21.221 --> 01:27:23.265
Why don't you
go home?

01:27:26.018 --> 01:27:30.939
I mean... I wanna be here
for you, Freddy, but...

01:27:31.064 --> 01:27:34.776
Lisa's nervous, you know.
She's pregnant.

01:27:34.901 --> 01:27:38.280
- I mean...
- So, go on. I'll be fine.

01:27:43.285 --> 01:27:45.245
You be careful,
Freddy, huh?

01:27:45.370 --> 01:27:47.623
Yeah. You too.

01:28:17.819 --> 01:28:19.738
Come on.

01:28:21.406 --> 01:28:23.325
Oh, shit!

01:28:23.450 --> 01:28:25.994
Get out, you jackass.
I said, get out, buddy.

01:28:26.119 --> 01:28:28.997
Oh, Jesus. You guys
don't wanna do this. Jack.

01:28:28.947 --> 01:28:32.493
- Don't shit in your pants.
He's not gonna kill ya.
- This is the good one, right?

01:28:32.618 --> 01:28:35.037
Oh, God! Oh, God!

01:28:35.162 --> 01:28:37.164
Move, move, move!

01:28:39.625 --> 01:28:42.836
All right, hit it, Jackie.
Hit it, Jack!

01:30:52.091 --> 01:30:54.301
Jesus Christ!

01:30:58.722 --> 01:31:00.099
You fuck!

01:32:46.246 --> 01:32:47.915
Freddy!

01:33:18.362 --> 01:33:21.115
I can't hear you,
Ray.

01:33:29.623 --> 01:33:33.168
Hey, hey, hey, hey!

01:33:33.293 --> 01:33:35.587
Hey, hey, hey.
What're you doin'?

01:33:35.712 --> 01:33:37.965
Excuse me, Lieutenant.

01:33:40.426 --> 01:33:43.011
Come on, guys, it's cool.
Everything's cool.

01:33:43.137 --> 01:33:47.015
Everything's cool. Everything's cool.
Come on. Come on. Everything's cool.

01:33:47.141 --> 01:33:48.976
- Where the hell are you goin'?
- Please move.

01:33:51.311 --> 01:33:52.855
Holy shit!

01:33:52.980 --> 01:33:55.065
Guys, guys, guys.
Beat it. Beat it.

01:33:55.190 --> 01:33:56.817
Everything's fine.
Everything's fine. It's cool.

01:33:56.942 --> 01:33:59.319
- Hey, hey, hey, hey!
- What the fuck?

01:33:59.445 --> 01:34:02.823
Come on, Freddy.
Everything's cool. Everything's fine.

01:34:02.948 --> 01:34:06.160
- Wait, wait, wait.
Where do you think you're goin'?
- Call E.M.S. Call E.M.S.

01:34:08.495 --> 01:34:12.332
Come on, fellas, back up.
Back up. Back up. Back up.

01:34:12.458 --> 01:34:16.170
- He can't hear.
- Reubens, take him.

01:34:16.295 --> 01:34:20.549
- Hey, hey, it's all right.
It's okay. It's okay.
- They blew out his ear.

01:34:20.674 --> 01:34:23.469
It's all right.
It's all right! It's okay.

01:34:23.594 --> 01:34:26.847
It's okay.
Come on.

01:34:28.474 --> 01:34:30.434
Go on, Freddy.

01:34:32.478 --> 01:34:34.730
Come on inside.

01:34:38.650 --> 01:34:41.403
Come on.

01:35:05.177 --> 01:35:07.805
So Gary Figgis copped a plea.

01:35:07.930 --> 01:35:11.725
Gave up the connection between
Ray, the P.D.A. and the mob.

01:35:11.850 --> 01:35:15.187
There were a shitload
of indictments.

01:35:15.312 --> 01:35:18.398
And the sheriff,
Freddy Heflin...

01:35:18.524 --> 01:35:22.277
You know, there's people on both sides
of the river wish he never recovered.

01:35:22.402 --> 01:35:25.364
They cursed the day
he took down Ray Donlan.

01:35:25.489 --> 01:35:27.783
But what they don't know,
he figured out.

01:35:27.908 --> 01:35:29.785
No one is above the law.

01:35:31.703 --> 01:35:34.665
Four cops dead,
and one dead cop resurrected.

01:35:34.790 --> 01:35:39.253
In a bizarre twist, Murray
"Superboy" Babitch sits alive
and well in a holding cell...

01:35:39.378 --> 01:35:42.756
Sheriff Fred Heflin
apprehended Babitch single-handedly.

01:35:42.881 --> 01:35:47.010
...he will
be recovering the hearing in his
good ear so that's good news.

01:35:47.136 --> 01:35:49.888
Files
were seized this morning...

01:35:50.013 --> 01:35:53.600
Officer Gary Figgis testified
about mob influence and bribery.

01:35:53.725 --> 01:35:55.811
Three months since
the shootout in Garrison, New Jersey,

01:35:55.936 --> 01:36:00.107
reputed mob boss Toy Torillo has been
indicted on four counts of racketeering.

01:36:00.232 --> 01:36:02.943
An unidentified corrections
officer was arrested today...

01:36:03.068 --> 01:36:05.612
for the murder three years ago
of Officer Glenn Tunney.

01:36:05.737 --> 01:36:08.574
I understand
Jim Allen is with the mayor.
Do you want to go back to him?

01:36:41.273 --> 01:36:43.150
Freddy!

01:36:43.275 --> 01:36:45.360
Freddy!

01:36:46.945 --> 01:36:49.323
Got a jackknifed truck
up on Route 5.

01:36:52.618 --> 01:36:55.287
You okay?

01:36:56.997 --> 01:36:58.624
Yeah.
