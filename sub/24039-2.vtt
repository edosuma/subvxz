00:06.407 --> 00:08.509
Well, I thought Lisbeth
didn't wanna talk to you.

00:08.542 --> 00:10.244
And she's in rehab anyway,
right?

00:10.278 --> 00:11.479
Stay away from me.

00:11.512 --> 00:13.181
I just wanna know why you left.

00:13.214 --> 00:15.516
James is going to work
at the Facility.

00:15.549 --> 00:18.319
Please stop lying.

00:18.352 --> 00:20.788
You act like everything
is great, and it is not.

00:20.821 --> 00:22.523
My stomach.

00:25.393 --> 00:26.560
- Hello.
- My God.

00:26.594 --> 00:27.561
Sorry about the tie on the door.

00:27.595 --> 00:29.263
No, you're not.

00:29.297 --> 00:31.832
These last few days
have just been killing me.

00:31.865 --> 00:34.468
I will make up for it.
Every minute we've waited.

00:34.502 --> 00:37.105
I don't think that this
is the right fit anymore.

00:38.872 --> 00:40.484
I'm gonna give you the movie
that I've been dreaming about.

00:40.508 --> 00:42.243
Megan is your star.

00:42.276 --> 00:43.820
I'm not gonna actually act
in the movie at all.

00:45.000 --> 00:51.074

00:59.693 --> 01:03.164
Megan, welcome to
Creative Partners.

01:10.538 --> 01:12.540
If you had to ask,
does it matter?

01:12.573 --> 01:14.142
Sure, it does.

01:15.609 --> 01:20.581
'Cause if it's fake, it's fake.

01:21.549 --> 01:23.884
Smart, principled, no bullshit.

01:23.917 --> 01:25.453
Is that the New Yorker in you,

01:25.486 --> 01:27.588
or is that the narrative
you crafted at IHM?

01:28.922 --> 01:30.524
I did the weekend intensive.

01:30.558 --> 01:32.193
We all did.

01:32.226 --> 01:34.395
Terence is an amazing talent,
isn't he?

01:34.428 --> 01:36.430
Yeah. Yeah, he is.

01:36.464 --> 01:38.432
Speaking of no bullshit,

01:38.466 --> 01:42.336
has anyone here seen
any of my work.

01:42.370 --> 01:44.314
You think we just rolled out
the red carpet for you

01:44.338 --> 01:46.207
because you're Kyle's fiancÃ©e?

01:46.240 --> 01:48.242
Well, I know you did, but...

01:48.276 --> 01:50.144
I asked about my work.

01:50.178 --> 01:52.880
What there is of it, yeah.
We have seen it.

01:52.913 --> 01:55.216
You've made the best
of small opportunities,

01:55.249 --> 01:57.318
but now your time has come.

01:57.351 --> 01:59.253
We all believe that
"Technicolor Highway"

01:59.287 --> 02:00.354
is gonna make you a star.

02:00.388 --> 02:01.922
Separate and apart from Kyle.

02:03.657 --> 02:05.493
We're gonna make you an icon.

02:05.526 --> 02:08.461
No, I don't need
to be an icon, I...

02:08.496 --> 02:10.931
Look, I just wanna get
my hands on great projects

02:10.964 --> 02:13.367
that I can lose myself in.

02:13.401 --> 02:15.503
Megan, we're the biggest
agency in the world.

02:15.536 --> 02:18.372
Getting your hands on great
projects will not be a problem.

02:18.406 --> 02:20.908
Getting you cast
is something else.

02:20.941 --> 02:22.410
Yeah, that's my job.

02:22.443 --> 02:24.345
It's true.
Thank God you're talented.

02:26.214 --> 02:28.749
But listen,
when you're the face of Prada,

02:28.782 --> 02:31.385
and Bulgari, and
the charity of your choosing...

02:31.419 --> 02:34.655
When you are a goodwill
ambassador to the world,

02:34.688 --> 02:37.325
I promise you, your job
gets a lot easier.

02:37.358 --> 02:39.927
If you don't like the word
"icon" then don't use it.

02:39.960 --> 02:41.695
Think of it as brand.

02:41.729 --> 02:45.233
Megan Morrison...
Like, Marilyn Monroe.

02:45.266 --> 02:47.668
- She died at 36.
- She had the wrong agent.

02:47.701 --> 02:50.371
It's not just about
being sought after.

02:50.404 --> 02:52.473
Your brand,
if we craft it correctly,

02:52.506 --> 02:53.674
gives you control.

02:53.707 --> 02:55.409
And longevity.

02:55.443 --> 02:57.445
So the real Megan can focus
on what she wants,

02:57.478 --> 03:00.748
what really matters.

03:11.525 --> 03:15.263
Dude! Why would you fire
yourself from your own movie?

03:15.296 --> 03:16.573
Right? It's... it's... I'm sorry.

03:16.597 --> 03:18.766
It just... it seems unwise
on so many levels.

03:18.799 --> 03:19.800
No, I get it.

03:19.833 --> 03:21.569
You know, I just...

03:21.602 --> 03:23.447
I thought it was more important
to focus on directing.

03:23.471 --> 03:25.439
And...
And let Megan carry the film.

03:25.473 --> 03:26.783
And you... you honestly
think she can do that?

03:26.807 --> 03:28.342
Put people in the seats?

03:28.376 --> 03:29.553
Megan's gonna
blow everybody away.

03:29.577 --> 03:31.279
Wow.

03:31.312 --> 03:33.423
I wish... I wish everybody
could've seen the man's face

03:33.447 --> 03:34.815
when he said that.

03:34.848 --> 03:36.393
II'm so inspired...
I feel like I can just run

03:36.417 --> 03:37.657
through a brick wall right now.

03:37.685 --> 03:38.795
The power of truth,
ladies and gentlemen.

03:38.819 --> 03:40.588
Okay, so tell me this.

03:40.621 --> 03:43.391
Does Megan get a say
in who takes your place?

03:43.424 --> 03:44.768
You know, we are... we're
gonna find the perfect person.

03:44.792 --> 03:46.594
I promise.

03:46.627 --> 03:48.827
All right, well, I happen
to be available, by the way.

03:49.730 --> 03:53.000
I'd love to meet this perfect
person who's replacing you.

03:53.033 --> 03:54.802
You don't like Howie
for the part?

03:54.835 --> 03:56.446
You know, that would be funny
if you weren't saying no

03:56.470 --> 03:58.472
to every actor that I suggest.

03:58.506 --> 04:00.550
They don't wanna audition,
they're not doing the movie.

04:00.574 --> 04:01.742
Period.

04:07.381 --> 04:08.782
So did you get
the big standing O?

04:08.816 --> 04:11.619
I did, and then
they promised me the world.

04:11.652 --> 04:13.621
Well, they pretty much
represent the world.

04:13.654 --> 04:14.622
What do you think?

04:14.655 --> 04:16.724
It's very compelling.

04:16.757 --> 04:17.757
A little disgusting.

04:17.791 --> 04:19.493
It's a lot to process.

04:19.527 --> 04:21.629
Okay, well, why don't
we go to the beach?

04:21.661 --> 04:23.397
I'll clear my afternoon.

04:23.431 --> 04:24.671
No, you don't have to do that.

04:24.698 --> 04:26.434
I'm on the other side of town.

04:26.467 --> 04:28.336
And I have a bunch
of errands to run.

04:28.369 --> 04:29.579
We could talk about it tonight.

04:29.603 --> 04:32.340
Okay, whatever you want.

04:33.807 --> 04:35.843
Is everything okay with you two?

04:35.876 --> 04:37.645
Of course.
Little stuff... no big deal.

04:39.513 --> 04:41.525
Because it would be awfully
hard to choose a love interest

04:41.549 --> 04:44.051
for her if you
two weren't... solid.

04:44.084 --> 04:45.786
Well, we're solid enough.

04:45.819 --> 04:47.831
Just literally trying
to find the right actor, DeAnn.

04:47.855 --> 04:49.899
And there isn't a part
of you that's a little worried

04:49.923 --> 04:52.426
about history repeating itself?

04:52.460 --> 04:54.061
No.

04:54.094 --> 04:57.365
And do me a favor...
Let's keep history in the past,

04:57.398 --> 04:58.899
where it belongs.

05:12.546 --> 05:14.682
That's one way
to release stress, I guess.

05:14.715 --> 05:17.551
Babe, that's not what that was.

05:17.585 --> 05:18.786
Not completely.

05:21.789 --> 05:23.657
How do you know these things?

05:23.691 --> 05:25.759
We spend one weekend
a year together.

05:25.793 --> 05:29.430
That's not nothing.

05:29.463 --> 05:31.665
So...

05:31.699 --> 05:32.700
Tell me.

05:32.733 --> 05:35.836
This movie.

05:35.869 --> 05:38.806
It's like on existential crisis
after another,

05:38.839 --> 05:40.674
and it...

05:40.708 --> 05:43.444
It's just...
It's so personal for Kyle.

05:43.477 --> 05:45.846
It's like he can't
see things rationally.

05:45.879 --> 05:47.156
Well, like what kind of things?

05:47.180 --> 05:49.650
Well...

05:49.683 --> 05:51.485
No.

05:51.519 --> 05:54.822
You are leaving soon, and I am
not gonna lie in bed with you

05:54.855 --> 05:57.691
bitching about Kyle,
because I do that with Terence.

05:57.725 --> 06:00.561
Lucky him.

06:01.795 --> 06:03.864
Babe, these are our lives.

06:03.897 --> 06:05.866
I would've loved to have
had you in my bed

06:05.899 --> 06:07.868
when Wes was in rehab.

06:07.901 --> 06:10.671
So we could've talked about
my failings as a mother.

06:10.704 --> 06:12.172
Stop.

06:12.205 --> 06:15.743
You know you're the only reason
he's still alive.

06:15.776 --> 06:18.479
He's alive.

06:18.512 --> 06:20.781
I don't know, I just worry.

06:20.814 --> 06:23.484
No, we're not doing this.

06:23.517 --> 06:24.852
Worry.

06:24.885 --> 06:25.886
Why are you laughing?

06:25.919 --> 06:27.521
Because you're right.

06:27.555 --> 06:28.865
I should save this shit
for book club.

06:28.889 --> 06:30.691
Yeah, book club.

06:30.724 --> 06:33.861
Yeah, that's what I need.

06:33.894 --> 06:38.632
I wanna talk about you.

06:38.666 --> 06:42.603
I wanna know what you
dreamt about last night.

06:42.636 --> 06:44.938
I wanna cook you dinner.

06:48.041 --> 06:51.645
See, this is the bad part
about you staying longer.

06:51.679 --> 06:53.781
It's the worst kind of tease.

06:53.814 --> 06:56.617
Well, you know, technically,

06:56.650 --> 06:58.919
I don't have to be on site
until the summer.

06:58.952 --> 07:01.622
I mean, the vineyard has plenty
of business in LA,

07:01.655 --> 07:03.724
and Wes is close by.

07:03.757 --> 07:05.793
You wanna stay until summer?

07:05.826 --> 07:08.462
Yeah.

07:10.631 --> 07:12.933
It's been a tough year.
I... I don't know.

07:12.966 --> 07:15.969
I wanna spend more time
with the people that I love.

07:16.003 --> 07:18.706
More than just one weekend.

07:20.741 --> 07:23.844
Why do you look
so terrified at that?

07:23.877 --> 07:25.646
- No, I'm not... it's not...
- Yeah, you do.

07:25.679 --> 07:28.916
No, no, it's not that.
It's just that...

07:31.051 --> 07:34.688
Look, when you leave...

07:34.722 --> 07:36.690
Terence and I get
there eventually,

07:36.724 --> 07:39.226
but it's a rough transition.

07:39.259 --> 07:43.664
If you stay, we're talking
about a fullblown affair.

07:43.697 --> 07:45.833
Yeah.

07:45.866 --> 07:48.001
That's what it would be.

07:50.571 --> 07:52.606
Mace, my marriage
might be dysfunctional,

07:52.640 --> 07:55.242
but I can't afford
to ruin it... not now.

07:55.275 --> 07:58.579
I'm not asking you to.

07:58.612 --> 08:02.282
Babe, I just don't wanna
leave you right now.

08:06.887 --> 08:09.289
So let's not be afraid
to admit it.

08:09.322 --> 08:11.091
Let's say it together...
I'm gonna be great.

08:11.124 --> 08:12.893
I'm gonna be great.

08:12.926 --> 08:14.695
- I'm gonna be great.
- I'm gonna be great.

08:14.728 --> 08:15.896
Come on, guys, lets...

08:15.929 --> 08:17.931
So are you watching the speech

08:17.965 --> 08:19.800
or are you just
counting the views?

08:19.833 --> 08:21.869
I'm gonna be great!

08:21.902 --> 08:23.737
You know, he's always had that.

08:23.771 --> 08:26.874
That magnetic thing that
people are attracted to.

08:26.907 --> 08:28.609
I saw it the day I met him.

08:28.642 --> 08:31.645
He was nobody, he had nothing,
but he had that.

08:31.679 --> 08:35.549
And you're surprised
by the response you're getting?

08:35.582 --> 08:37.326
When it gets to 15 million
call Scholastic.

08:37.350 --> 08:39.852
Or maybe I will.

08:39.886 --> 08:42.956
Um... I'm... I'm all packed up
and ready to go,

08:42.990 --> 08:45.593
I just wanted to say thank you.

08:47.060 --> 08:49.797
James starts training
at the Facility tomorrow.

08:49.830 --> 08:52.099
Yeah, can't wait.

08:54.367 --> 08:56.637
Um... end of next month.

08:57.705 --> 08:59.773
Wow, okay.

08:59.807 --> 09:02.576
Well, safe travels.

09:02.610 --> 09:05.345
Good luck.

09:05.378 --> 09:07.915
You okay?

09:09.950 --> 09:11.719
You seem a little disappointed.

09:11.752 --> 09:12.953
What?

09:12.986 --> 09:14.788
No, no, no, no... just...

09:14.822 --> 09:19.793
Busy with some things.

09:47.387 --> 09:50.357
Hi. Come in.

10:00.801 --> 10:04.004
No paparazzi, and no IHM tail.

10:04.037 --> 10:05.839
You must be a good driver.

10:05.873 --> 10:08.175
Well, I learned
from cabbies in New York City,

10:08.208 --> 10:10.010
so it's not necessarily
good, but...

10:12.813 --> 10:15.783
It's Momordica charantia.
It purifies the blood.

10:15.816 --> 10:17.184
Thank you.

10:17.217 --> 10:19.019
And thank you again
for having me over.

10:19.052 --> 10:20.954
This is really lovely.

10:23.957 --> 10:25.225
Um...

10:25.258 --> 10:27.661
I'm really sorry about the way

10:27.695 --> 10:29.997
I approached you
the other night.

10:30.030 --> 10:33.133
I have to be careful
about who I interact with.

10:33.166 --> 10:36.904
The world is extremely toxic.

10:39.006 --> 10:41.709
But that can't be you.

10:41.742 --> 10:43.944
Kyle wouldn't love you
if it was.

10:53.153 --> 10:56.957
There are so many things
I wanna ask you, um...

10:57.958 --> 11:00.160
Can we start with Terence?

11:00.193 --> 11:04.164
He's done things that should've
destroyed me and Kyle,

11:04.197 --> 11:07.768
and it makes me wonder
if he did something

11:07.801 --> 11:10.771
to make you leave.

11:10.804 --> 11:13.440
They poisoned my food and water.

11:13.473 --> 11:15.743
By who?

11:15.776 --> 11:18.178
By IHM people?
They'd break into my trailer.

11:18.211 --> 11:20.714
Never the same person...
Not once.

11:20.748 --> 11:23.216
I mean, there were
always new people.

11:23.250 --> 11:24.918
That isn't normal.

11:24.952 --> 11:26.820
Did you tell Kyle about this,
or anyone?

11:26.854 --> 11:28.021
Kyle wasn't there.

11:28.055 --> 11:31.058
I mean, I had to fire everybody.

11:31.091 --> 11:33.226
I still have problems eating.

11:33.260 --> 11:36.229
You were having stomach
problems, like...

11:36.263 --> 11:38.198
Like sharp pains?

11:41.234 --> 11:43.303
Lisbeth?

11:43.336 --> 11:46.306
Would you like some tea?

11:46.339 --> 11:50.077
It's Momordica charantia.
It purifies the blood.

11:51.244 --> 11:53.747
You already have some.

11:53.781 --> 11:55.491
Well, you were telling me
that you were having

11:55.515 --> 11:58.919
eating problems, and I've been
having these sharp pains...

11:58.952 --> 12:02.489
I have to be very careful
about who I interact with.

12:02.522 --> 12:06.794
The world is extremely toxic.

12:09.329 --> 12:10.998
But that can't be you...

12:11.031 --> 12:12.499
You...

12:16.536 --> 12:18.839
Kyle loves you, doesn't he?

12:22.075 --> 12:24.211
Yeah.

12:33.086 --> 12:34.387
I'm just messing around

12:34.421 --> 12:37.024
The cake is Godzilla
attacking the city.

12:37.057 --> 12:39.059
Aha, right, yes.

12:39.092 --> 12:40.894
Sexy now.

12:40.928 --> 12:44.031
Right, you're a vampire,
biting the tip.

12:46.199 --> 12:48.235
Yes, thank you. Awesome.

12:48.268 --> 12:49.402
Thank you.

12:49.436 --> 12:52.005
Let's set up for the next bit.

12:52.039 --> 12:53.340
Hey I'm Kyle.

12:53.373 --> 12:56.076
Hey, I'm Megan.
I think we have the same agent.

12:56.109 --> 12:57.987
Maybe that's why we keep
bumping into each other.

12:58.011 --> 12:59.246
What're you doing later?

12:59.279 --> 13:00.924
Just being honored
at some Hollywood party

13:00.948 --> 13:02.282
where Xavier Hughes
is performing.

13:02.315 --> 13:04.484
You know, the youshe.
Ooh, I like parties.

13:04.517 --> 13:06.019
I like you.

13:06.053 --> 13:07.063
Did you wanna talk
about schedule?

13:07.087 --> 13:08.521
- Yes.
- Not really.

13:08.555 --> 13:10.357
The coffee with the
Twitter people tomorrow...

13:10.390 --> 13:12.101
Do you think we could
push them to today after 3:00?

13:12.125 --> 13:14.103
I would love to talk to them
before the gala tonight.

13:14.127 --> 13:15.471
The agency has you
at the gift suite at 3:00.

13:15.495 --> 13:17.297
I thought that was after lunch.

13:17.330 --> 13:20.167
It was, but Stacy
at Balenciaga has strep throat,

13:20.200 --> 13:21.444
so the styling
got pushed to 1:00.

13:21.468 --> 13:23.170
So when are we doing
the phone call?

13:23.203 --> 13:24.447
Can you do it
in the car on the way?

13:24.471 --> 13:26.039
Well, it's not
gonna be great for you.

13:26.073 --> 13:27.283
No, it's fine,
I could listen to music

13:27.307 --> 13:28.351
while I prep for
the Seacrest thing.

13:28.375 --> 13:29.943
There you go.

13:29.977 --> 13:32.012
Hey, Kyle, can I steal you
for a second?

13:32.045 --> 13:34.247
Yeah. I'll be back.

13:34.281 --> 13:36.149
See if Twitter can do a call.

13:36.183 --> 13:37.150
Maybe on the way
to your reads later?

13:37.184 --> 13:38.385
Thank you.

13:38.418 --> 13:40.120
- They're bluffing.
- I doubt it.

13:40.153 --> 13:41.464
Look, you took yourself
out of the movie.

13:41.488 --> 13:42.999
You won't cast somebody
that they like.

13:43.023 --> 13:44.267
I'd pull my money too
if I were them.

13:44.291 --> 13:45.534
Okay, let's just say
they back out.

13:45.558 --> 13:47.070
How much of my own money
do I have to put up?

13:47.094 --> 13:48.061
We are not having
that conversation.

13:48.095 --> 13:49.462
It's just a question.

13:49.496 --> 13:51.207
If you use your money,
you have nobody to answer to.

13:51.231 --> 13:53.100
I love you, but I am
not letting you direct

13:53.133 --> 13:54.501
your first
feature film unchecked.

13:54.534 --> 13:57.304
I'm sorry,
but if we lose Jason and Vic,

13:57.337 --> 13:58.405
we are shutting down.

13:58.438 --> 14:01.041
Look, we have to cast somebody.

14:01.074 --> 14:03.443
I think it
should be Logan Travers.

14:04.477 --> 14:07.180
Ooh, is that
the next cover of "Esquire"?

14:07.214 --> 14:10.283
- "Vanity Fair."
- Oops... still, wow.

14:10.317 --> 14:11.584
I know, I know.

14:11.618 --> 14:14.154
Creative Partners does not play.

14:14.187 --> 14:15.431
I've been with them
for two months,

14:15.455 --> 14:17.257
and they have me,
like, everywhere.

14:17.290 --> 14:21.461
So how are you feeling
about the wedding?

14:21.494 --> 14:23.230
It is hard to say.

14:23.263 --> 14:25.265
Until Terence is
out of the picture,

14:25.298 --> 14:26.499
everything is just temporary.

14:26.533 --> 14:28.235
Yeah.

14:28.268 --> 14:31.204
I mean, Kyle and I are
definitely having more fun,

14:31.238 --> 14:33.206
but, I don't know,
we've been so busy,

14:33.240 --> 14:37.110
sometimes I forget that I still
don't trust him, you know?

14:37.144 --> 14:39.279
Like, not completely.

14:42.149 --> 14:44.051
Are you still having those?

14:44.084 --> 14:45.418
Occasionally.

14:45.452 --> 14:48.088
Well, what did the doctor say?

14:48.121 --> 14:50.090
You haven't been to the doctor?

14:50.123 --> 14:51.600
It's been two months.
What the hell are you doing?

14:51.624 --> 14:55.195
I'm okay, and I'm doing what
I need to be doing right now.

14:55.228 --> 14:56.463
You're not okay.

14:56.496 --> 14:57.606
You're running yourself
into the ground.

14:57.630 --> 15:00.167
I'm building my brand.

15:00.200 --> 15:01.534
And a career, okay?

15:01.568 --> 15:03.270
When shit goes down
with Terence,

15:03.303 --> 15:06.206
I'm gonna need protection.

15:06.239 --> 15:08.041
What's going on with James?

15:08.075 --> 15:10.410
He's finally back in town.
We're having dinner tonight.

15:10.443 --> 15:12.412
- That's my girl.
- Yeah.

15:13.580 --> 15:15.148
I don't know, it's weird.

15:15.182 --> 15:17.117
Just like fullon playing
someone like this?

15:17.150 --> 15:18.418
I'm not used to lying.

15:18.451 --> 15:21.054
The key is to be
as honest as possible.

15:21.088 --> 15:23.456
You only lie if you
absolutely have to.

15:23.490 --> 15:25.192
Okay.

15:25.225 --> 15:28.128
I'm just messing around

15:28.161 --> 15:31.398
I'm just messing around,
around

15:31.431 --> 15:34.101
I'm just messing around

15:34.134 --> 15:39.106
And I like it, like it,
like it, yes, I do

15:40.107 --> 15:42.075
Let's identify our feelings.

15:42.109 --> 15:45.045
- Terence.
- Sadness.

15:45.078 --> 15:47.280
Distant.

15:47.314 --> 15:50.183
Keep trying.

15:50.217 --> 15:52.085
Loneliness.

15:52.119 --> 15:54.487
Good. Everybody present.

15:56.256 --> 15:58.158
Let's talk.

15:58.191 --> 16:00.593
Misaligned narratives
without pairing.

16:00.627 --> 16:03.363
Misaligned narratives
is the symptom.

16:03.396 --> 16:07.200
The root is an absence
of intimacy.

16:07.234 --> 16:09.369
Let's talk about
the emotional first.

16:09.402 --> 16:11.447
Well, let's talk about
the physical intimacy first,

16:11.471 --> 16:13.273
because that's truly
what's been absent here.

16:13.306 --> 16:14.450
You really just
can't let her lead?

16:14.474 --> 16:16.143
It's okay.

16:16.176 --> 16:17.677
We'll get there,
one way or the other.

16:17.710 --> 16:19.646
You aren't having sex
with each other?

16:19.679 --> 16:21.648
Not since the tie
on the doorknob.

16:21.681 --> 16:23.483
Two months ago,
and not much before that.

16:23.516 --> 16:25.261
Is that supposed to justify
the tie on the door?

16:25.285 --> 16:26.662
I don't understand
this emotional reaction.

16:26.686 --> 16:28.155
I really don't.

16:28.188 --> 16:29.689
We're not polyamorous,
we're open.

16:29.722 --> 16:31.424
Feelings for each other
and nobody else.

16:31.458 --> 16:32.568
I follow the rules,
and you won't have sex with me

16:32.592 --> 16:34.327
because of a tie on the door?

16:34.361 --> 16:37.130
It's not rational.
It was a slap in the face.

16:37.164 --> 16:38.665
- It was a head's up.
- Okay.

16:38.698 --> 16:42.235
Obviously there is an
emotional component to the tie,

16:42.269 --> 16:45.605
but an open relationship can't
work unless you are having sex

16:45.638 --> 16:47.640
with each other regularly.

16:47.674 --> 16:52.379
So what do we need
to get us there?

17:15.502 --> 17:17.569
I already called the cops.

17:17.604 --> 17:19.771
If you run now, you can make it.

17:22.309 --> 17:23.542
Keys.

17:23.576 --> 17:25.212
All right, man.

17:25.244 --> 17:26.555
All right, all right,
take it easy, man.

17:26.579 --> 17:27.780
Take it easy.

17:27.814 --> 17:31.284
- Give me the key.
- Okay, okay.

17:31.318 --> 17:32.685
God damn it. Get it.

17:32.719 --> 17:35.788
- Okay, okay, okay.
- Get the key!

17:35.822 --> 17:39.426
Come on.

17:39.459 --> 17:42.695
I didn't say get up.
Don't get up.

17:42.729 --> 17:45.565
I said, don't look at me!

18:14.861 --> 18:17.530
- Kyle, Kyle!
- Megan, over here.

18:17.564 --> 18:20.700
- Kyle, over here.
- Meg, look over here.

18:25.838 --> 18:27.707
Yeah.

18:31.178 --> 18:32.612
It is a thrill for me.

18:32.645 --> 18:34.281
Megan is such an amazing person,

18:34.314 --> 18:35.824
and I'm just really excited
that I get to watch her

18:35.848 --> 18:37.350
accomplish so many great things.

18:37.384 --> 18:38.894
Speaking of which,
can you tell me a little bit

18:38.918 --> 18:40.587
about your wedding?

18:40.620 --> 18:42.655
Like, when is it,
where, who's invited?

18:42.689 --> 18:45.658
Soon, it's a secret,
and, everybody we love.

18:45.692 --> 18:47.327
Thanks.

18:47.360 --> 18:49.796
Domestic violence and abuse
is obviously a huge issue

18:49.829 --> 18:51.931
all over the world,
but by acting locally,

18:51.964 --> 18:54.301
we can directly impact
the people and the families

18:54.334 --> 18:55.835
who need it most.

18:55.868 --> 18:57.937
- Great, thanks.
- Thank you.

18:57.970 --> 18:59.806
- Good night.
- You were born for this.

18:59.839 --> 19:02.409
Well, I definitely
learned a few things from you.

19:06.646 --> 19:09.349
I love you.

19:13.353 --> 19:15.588
If I may direct your attention
to the fireplace,

19:15.622 --> 19:18.758
you will see your new costar.

19:18.791 --> 19:20.793
Logan Travers.

19:20.827 --> 19:22.729
I invited him.

19:22.762 --> 19:24.597
I sent him a script last week.

19:24.631 --> 19:26.409
I spent 20 minutes talking
to him about his dog;

19:26.433 --> 19:27.800
It's a rescue Mastiff.

19:27.834 --> 19:29.602
Look, he is interested
in the part.

19:29.636 --> 19:31.938
And he's good.
What do you think?

19:31.971 --> 19:33.906
Meh.

19:33.940 --> 19:36.743
Okay, more importantly, Jason
and Vic are interested in him.

19:36.776 --> 19:38.221
What, did you already
negotiate his contract,

19:38.245 --> 19:39.688
as well?
It's called "teeing him up."

19:39.712 --> 19:41.681
Listen, just go talk to him.
Please?

19:41.714 --> 19:43.683
He's expecting you.
It's just a conversation.

19:43.716 --> 19:45.218
If you don't like him,
you can say no.

19:52.392 --> 19:55.362
It's where we met.

19:55.395 --> 19:57.230
Not that long ago, in fact.

19:57.264 --> 19:59.899
My God. That thing for the NRDC?

19:59.932 --> 20:03.002
Yeah, you were
schlepping hors d'oeuvres

20:03.035 --> 20:04.471
and mouthing off
to studio heads.

20:04.504 --> 20:06.339
Now, listen to me.

20:06.373 --> 20:08.475
I knew you were special
when we met.

20:08.508 --> 20:10.843
I knew you were capable
of this and so much more,

20:10.877 --> 20:13.446
but "Technicolor Highway"
is your launch pad.

20:13.480 --> 20:15.248
Without it,
none of this happens.

20:15.282 --> 20:16.816
I'm well aware.

20:16.849 --> 20:19.018
Okay, are you also aware
that the investors

20:19.051 --> 20:20.996
are fed up with Kyle
and wanna pull the financing?

20:21.020 --> 20:23.456
No. He didn't tell me that.

20:23.490 --> 20:24.824
Of course, he didn't.

20:24.857 --> 20:26.034
Look, he might be
in denial about this,

20:26.058 --> 20:27.494
but we are out of time.

20:27.527 --> 20:28.761
If we're gonna make this movie

20:28.795 --> 20:29.838
and keep your arrow pointing up,

20:29.862 --> 20:31.298
Logan Travers has to happen.

20:31.331 --> 20:32.932
Kyle can't say no anymore.

20:32.965 --> 20:35.368
- You want me to talk to him.
- Yes, talk to Kyle.

20:35.402 --> 20:36.936
Talk to Logan.
Whatever it takes.

20:36.969 --> 20:38.771
Megan, this is your movie.

20:38.805 --> 20:40.807
And your everything else.

20:48.848 --> 20:50.417
Whiskey.

20:50.450 --> 20:52.385
Actually, I'm pretty sure
Kyle West is God.

20:52.419 --> 20:53.786
He memorized the whole speech.

20:53.820 --> 20:55.688
I watch it every morning
before I run.

20:55.722 --> 20:58.491
"We wanna realize the greatest
version of ourselves."

20:58.525 --> 21:01.961
"That's how we can accomplish
unimaginable things."

21:01.994 --> 21:03.330
No bullshit, my times are down.

21:04.964 --> 21:07.300
I told you I was gonna need
your help with Kyle tonight.

21:07.334 --> 21:08.868
Out and about.

21:08.901 --> 21:12.004
What else?

21:12.038 --> 21:16.343
I didn't come here to
have a goddamn discussion.

21:21.113 --> 21:23.483
Hooper is seriously,
like, half the dudes

21:23.516 --> 21:25.818
that I grew up
with in Kentucky, man.

21:25.852 --> 21:29.456
You know, tough on the outside,
broken on the inside.

21:29.489 --> 21:31.491
And looking for that someone
to hang onto,

21:31.524 --> 21:32.992
but they don't know how.

21:33.025 --> 21:34.994
You know, nobody ever
gave them the tools.

21:35.027 --> 21:36.396
Yeah, that's definitely Hooper.

21:38.030 --> 21:39.866
Little bit?

21:39.899 --> 21:43.436
Come on, we're in this business
to tell our stories, right?

21:43.470 --> 21:45.338
My story's actually Clyde's.

21:45.372 --> 21:46.915
The hot girl
who kills herself at the end.

21:46.939 --> 21:49.376
Yeah.

21:52.111 --> 21:55.047
Wow, okay.

21:55.081 --> 21:56.949
That's deep.

21:56.983 --> 21:59.819
This is a lot of talent
to process at one time.

21:59.852 --> 22:01.354
That's exactly how I just felt.

22:01.388 --> 22:02.531
I don't know how you live
with this guy.

22:02.555 --> 22:05.024
Aw, he makes it easy, trust me.

22:05.057 --> 22:06.859
Megan Morrison,
meet Logan Travers.

22:06.893 --> 22:08.561
Kyle and I caught "Park Circle"

22:08.595 --> 22:10.072
at the Venice
Film Festival last year,

22:10.096 --> 22:11.398
and we just loved it.

22:11.431 --> 22:13.500
So nice of you to say.

22:16.869 --> 22:18.838
Chardonnay, please.

22:30.517 --> 22:33.786
- Logan Travers.
- Nasim.

22:33.820 --> 22:35.154
What're you doing here?

22:35.187 --> 22:37.424
I'll be honest,
I'm straight up using you

22:37.457 --> 22:38.991
so I can meet these two.

22:39.025 --> 22:41.528
Congratulations.
This is so exciting.

22:41.561 --> 22:42.995
And I love your charity.

22:43.029 --> 22:44.464
Thank you.

22:44.497 --> 22:45.965
Kyle and Megan,
meet Nasim Anand.

22:45.998 --> 22:47.500
This is my old partner in crime.

22:47.534 --> 22:50.002
We did a horrible
movie together.

22:50.036 --> 22:52.572
But I just have to say,
I am totally obsessed

22:52.605 --> 22:54.507
with the Institute
of the Higher Mind right now.

22:54.541 --> 22:56.042
That sounds unhealthy.

22:56.075 --> 22:57.444
Yeah, my boyfriend

22:57.477 --> 22:59.011
says the same thing.

22:59.045 --> 23:00.589
But, you know, the speech
you gave in that video

23:00.613 --> 23:01.881
was amazing.

23:01.914 --> 23:03.950
You're really inspirational.

23:05.685 --> 23:08.455
There he is.

23:08.488 --> 23:10.557
You know, I discovered this one.

23:10.590 --> 23:12.425
I discovered you.

23:12.459 --> 23:14.427
You were very small,

23:14.461 --> 23:16.829
but I thought to myself,
he's gonna be great.

23:19.466 --> 23:22.869
That's right. Yes,
this man showed me the way.

23:22.902 --> 23:24.571
Come on, let me buy you a drink.

23:24.604 --> 23:25.972
Let's go. Excuse us.

23:32.512 --> 23:34.113
I almost died.

23:34.146 --> 23:35.691
Yeah, well, tomorrow
you're gonna wish you died.

23:35.715 --> 23:37.584
Look, let's get you
some coffee, all right?

23:37.617 --> 23:39.118
To have him here tonight,

23:39.151 --> 23:44.591
so please welcome
the incredible Xavier Hughes!

23:51.531 --> 23:55.234
That's my boyfriend.

24:05.545 --> 24:07.547
Yeah.

24:07.580 --> 24:09.148
Xavier Hughes
playing at an event

24:09.181 --> 24:10.983
where you're being honored.

24:11.017 --> 24:14.020
His first album... best
breakup therapy in the world.

24:14.053 --> 24:16.523
My God, "Buried Under
a Blanket and Barely Alive".

24:17.657 --> 24:18.958
What do you think, Mr. Travers,

24:18.991 --> 24:20.268
are we gonna do
this movie together?

24:20.292 --> 24:22.161
Shoot, I hope so.

24:22.194 --> 24:24.664
It's kind of up to El Jefe
at this point, though.

24:24.697 --> 24:26.633
He's a little hard to read?

24:26.666 --> 24:29.669
Kyle loves you. Believe me.

24:29.702 --> 24:33.072
Well, you are
extremely believable.

24:33.105 --> 24:34.607
Just propped your
drunk husband up

24:34.641 --> 24:36.543
with a triple cappuccino.

24:36.576 --> 24:37.753
What the hell is wrong with him?

24:37.777 --> 24:39.546
I have no idea,

24:39.579 --> 24:41.123
but they look cute together,
don't they?

24:41.147 --> 24:43.916
What do you think?

24:43.950 --> 24:45.585
Megan, Logan.

24:45.618 --> 24:46.929
Can Friendspace Live
just grab a moment

24:46.953 --> 24:48.054
before the ceremony begins?

24:48.087 --> 24:49.756
- Yeah, of course!
- Okay.

24:53.760 --> 24:55.528
We are streaming live here

24:55.562 --> 24:57.129
from the Rising Women
of Hollywood Gala

24:57.163 --> 24:59.666
with Megan Morrison
and Logan Travers.

24:59.699 --> 25:01.033
- Hi, you guys.
- Hi, Friendspace.

25:01.067 --> 25:02.602
Hi, there.

25:02.635 --> 25:04.547
Now, are you guys talking
business or are you just

25:04.571 --> 25:07.139
appreciating how incredible
Xavier Hughes is?

25:07.173 --> 25:09.008
Well, a little bit of both.

25:09.041 --> 25:11.678
Megan, you have
a huge movie coming up,

25:11.711 --> 25:13.121
and you're about to marry
one of the biggest stars

25:13.145 --> 25:15.014
in the entire world.

25:15.047 --> 25:16.967
Talk to us a little bit
about how working with...

25:18.017 --> 25:21.988
Megan?

25:24.090 --> 25:25.692
Megan, Megan.

25:25.725 --> 25:27.960
Hey, Megan, Megan. Hey, Megan.

25:27.994 --> 25:30.229
Hey, sweetie.

25:30.262 --> 25:31.764
Not right now.

25:36.202 --> 25:37.946
Three hours since Megan
Morrison's collapse

25:37.970 --> 25:39.848
at the Alist Hollywood event
and we already have

25:39.872 --> 25:41.808
conflicting insider reports
of drugs, pregnancy,

25:41.841 --> 25:44.644
and an eating disorder.

25:44.677 --> 25:47.279
1.8 million live views.

25:47.313 --> 25:49.716
The agency keeps
pestering me for answers.

25:49.749 --> 25:51.851
Because the new client
launch fell apart?

25:51.884 --> 25:53.119
Screw 'em.

25:53.152 --> 25:54.621
This insider's going with drugs.

25:54.654 --> 25:55.831
No, it's not drugs, all right?

25:55.855 --> 25:57.724
I would know.

25:57.757 --> 25:59.768
Yeah, that's the problem...
You think you know everything,

25:59.792 --> 26:02.261
until you realize
you don't know anything.

26:03.896 --> 26:05.765
And this is Jason and Vic
for the third time.

26:05.798 --> 26:07.634
We need to talk about Logan.

26:07.667 --> 26:08.968
Not now we don't.

26:09.001 --> 26:11.337
Kyle, this fiasco
just makes things worse.

26:11.370 --> 26:14.206
Please, just let me give them
something to stop the carnage.

26:15.775 --> 26:17.810
How is she?

26:17.844 --> 26:19.879
She'll be okay here
for the night.

26:19.912 --> 26:21.914
This is for the pain.

26:21.948 --> 26:23.382
If you can convince her
to take it.

26:23.415 --> 26:24.855
She wouldn't accept
anything from me.

26:26.285 --> 26:27.386
I took some blood.

26:27.419 --> 26:28.888
I'll run it over the zombies

26:28.921 --> 26:31.290
at the lab
and be back in the morning.

26:31.323 --> 26:34.894
She doesn't wanna admit it, but
she's wound up like a spring.

26:34.927 --> 26:38.330
Whatever you could do to keep
her relaxed would be good.

26:38.364 --> 26:42.001
Good night.

26:53.746 --> 26:55.347
It's okay.

27:34.921 --> 27:36.455
Yoohoo.

27:36.488 --> 27:37.957
You're very focused.

27:37.990 --> 27:39.926
You having a hard time deciding?

27:39.959 --> 27:41.360
Um...

27:41.393 --> 27:42.729
There's no rush.

27:42.762 --> 27:45.765
You can just talk to me instead.

27:45.798 --> 27:47.967
I'm sorry, um...

27:48.000 --> 27:49.936
I'm... I'm excited to see you.

27:49.969 --> 27:53.272
It's just, I feel like
we've kind of skipped over...

27:53.305 --> 27:55.307
something.

27:57.009 --> 27:59.746
The explanation for why
you ghosted me at work.

27:59.779 --> 28:03.983
For weeks, and then
how we got here from there.

28:04.016 --> 28:05.752
I'm sorry.

28:05.785 --> 28:08.387
Your feelings are
completely valid.

28:08.420 --> 28:12.825
But... but shouldn't we just
focus on moving forward?

28:14.060 --> 28:16.062
We should, we should.

28:16.095 --> 28:18.330
I... I give that advice every day.

28:18.364 --> 28:21.734
- But...
- Look.

28:21.768 --> 28:24.403
This is the first job I've had

28:24.436 --> 28:26.906
where I don't feel like
I'm settling

28:26.939 --> 28:28.975
in any way.

28:29.008 --> 28:30.943
And I'm scared.

28:30.977 --> 28:36.482
I got scared of a personal
relationship ruining that.

28:36.515 --> 28:39.118
That's all.

28:39.151 --> 28:41.287
And I didn't handle it well.

28:41.320 --> 28:44.123
Well, if you're scared,
then... then...

28:44.156 --> 28:45.892
No.

28:48.060 --> 28:50.863
I'm settled in now.

28:50.897 --> 28:54.066
And I think there's room
for both.

28:57.436 --> 28:59.906
Ordinary stress can really
cause that kind of pain?

28:59.939 --> 29:02.775
There's nothing ordinary
about her narrative right now.

29:02.809 --> 29:05.377
You need to find ways
to manage the pressure.

29:05.411 --> 29:07.880
You might start by taking
something off your plate.

29:12.184 --> 29:13.820
He's talking about the movie.

29:13.853 --> 29:15.463
He's gonna tell them
that I'm not up for it.

29:15.487 --> 29:16.956
- God damn it.
- Relax.

29:16.989 --> 29:17.990
You're jumping the gun.

29:18.024 --> 29:19.926
He's IHM, Shaun.

29:19.959 --> 29:21.060
Don't tell me I'm wrong

29:21.093 --> 29:22.533
for thinking
bad things might happen.

29:22.561 --> 29:26.065
It's not gonna help.

29:26.098 --> 29:28.467
You need to chill, Megan.

29:28.500 --> 29:30.145
If you don't wanna
believe the doctor, fine,

29:30.169 --> 29:31.503
but believe your body.

29:31.537 --> 29:33.072
It's telling you the same thing.

29:33.105 --> 29:34.817
All right, maybe I'm just
getting stomach cancer,

29:34.841 --> 29:36.375
like my mom had.

29:36.408 --> 29:38.945
You need to stop spinning out.

29:38.978 --> 29:40.880
Okay?

29:42.148 --> 29:43.883
I actually have some potential

29:43.916 --> 29:45.952
good news.

29:45.985 --> 29:50.156
I think I can convince James
to take me to the Facility.

29:51.891 --> 29:53.960
He's going back up tomorrow.

29:53.993 --> 29:57.363
Hopefully I'll learn something
that can actually help us out.

29:57.396 --> 29:59.999
And take something
off your plate.

30:00.032 --> 30:01.509
Because he's not right
for the part!

30:01.533 --> 30:03.035
How many times
do I have to say it?

30:03.069 --> 30:04.837
No one's gonna force Logan
down my throat.

30:04.871 --> 30:06.372
Not Jason and Vic, and not you.

30:06.405 --> 30:08.140
I will kill
this movie completely.

30:08.174 --> 30:10.042
That is exactly
what you've been doing

30:10.076 --> 30:11.143
for the past two months.

30:12.879 --> 30:14.122
Jason and Vic want an answer
on Logan Travers

30:14.146 --> 30:15.514
and apparently
that answer is "no."

30:15.547 --> 30:17.016
Why?

30:17.049 --> 30:19.986
I don't wanna
listen to this anymore.

30:20.019 --> 30:22.021
I have worked my ass off
on this movie.

30:22.054 --> 30:23.155
And so has she.

30:23.189 --> 30:24.623
But none of that's gonna matter

30:24.656 --> 30:27.126
because you let your shit
get in the way.

30:41.941 --> 30:45.011
Don't look at me!

30:45.044 --> 30:48.948
I said don't look at me!

31:09.635 --> 31:12.338
When DeAnn said you let
your shit get in the way,

31:12.371 --> 31:15.107
what'd she mean?

31:15.141 --> 31:16.581
She thinks
I'm jealous about Logan.

31:16.608 --> 31:20.312
Or anybody else up for the part.

31:20.346 --> 31:23.015
Sounds a little simplistic.

31:23.049 --> 31:26.318
Yeah, except for when I met
Lisbeth on set, I was single,

31:26.352 --> 31:28.454
and she was dating the director.

31:28.487 --> 31:30.356
Lisbeth.

31:30.389 --> 31:32.024
Yeah.

31:32.058 --> 31:35.427
It got really dramatic.

31:35.461 --> 31:38.230
And we all got caught up in it.

31:38.264 --> 31:40.008
And you're afraid the same
thing's gonna happen

31:40.032 --> 31:42.034
with me and Logan?

31:42.068 --> 31:43.402
That's DeAnn's theory, yeah.

31:43.435 --> 31:46.105
I'm asking you.

31:47.439 --> 31:50.176
Right, "me" as in me.

31:55.047 --> 31:56.524
You know, I've been pretending
to be other people

31:56.548 --> 32:00.219
for a long time,

32:00.252 --> 32:03.155
but when I direct,

32:03.189 --> 32:06.625
I'm not gonna be able to hide
behind an image anymore.

32:06.658 --> 32:09.428
The way I think,
the way I see the world...

32:12.198 --> 32:16.168
It's all gonna be exposed.

32:16.202 --> 32:20.339
And the movie doesn't
have to be perfect.

32:20.372 --> 32:23.575
You know, nobody's perfect.

32:23.609 --> 32:26.245
But it has to be right.

32:26.278 --> 32:29.515
Why would I settle
for anything less?

32:29.548 --> 32:31.217
You can't.

32:31.250 --> 32:32.551
You know, Logan's really good.

32:32.584 --> 32:34.286
I mean, the guy's talented.

32:34.320 --> 32:37.389
You know, why... why wouldn't
I pull the trigger?

32:41.660 --> 32:44.063
Maybe DeAnn's right.

32:44.096 --> 32:45.331
Maybe I am jealous.

32:48.334 --> 32:49.535
You know...

32:52.371 --> 32:54.340
We have a contract

32:54.373 --> 32:57.076
that forbids me from having
an affair with a costar,

32:57.109 --> 32:58.244
or anyone else.

32:58.277 --> 32:59.411
Yes, I do know that.

32:59.445 --> 33:00.612
Come on, please.

33:00.646 --> 33:02.214
Contracts get broken
all the time.

33:02.248 --> 33:05.151
Yeah,
maybe by major movie stars.

33:05.184 --> 33:07.553
Last year, I was a waitress.

33:07.586 --> 33:10.356
I'm not throwing away
$10 million on a piece of ass.

33:10.389 --> 33:11.599
You're probably the first
person in Hollywood

33:11.623 --> 33:15.661
ever to say that.

33:24.770 --> 33:29.408
You know, that was really
beautiful, what you said.

33:29.441 --> 33:31.577
About the movie being an
expression of who you are

33:31.610 --> 33:32.644
on the inside.

33:32.678 --> 33:34.346
And you're right,

33:34.380 --> 33:38.317
it's something that people
haven't seen before,

33:38.350 --> 33:40.652
but you showed it to me.

33:40.686 --> 33:43.189
And I loved it.

33:43.222 --> 33:46.258
And look, I know things
have been crazy,

33:46.292 --> 33:48.627
but I feel like
we're growing closer.

33:51.230 --> 33:53.632
That feels really good.

33:53.665 --> 33:56.602
And I won't let anyone... anyone...

33:56.635 --> 33:59.705
Get in the way of that.

33:59.738 --> 34:01.707
Me neither.

34:03.342 --> 34:05.411
Okay.

34:05.444 --> 34:07.346
So...

34:07.379 --> 34:10.716
knowing that, how do you really
feel about Logan Travers?

34:18.324 --> 34:21.226
Well, guess
who's in the neighborhood.

34:25.764 --> 34:29.534
I swear,
Berglund just invades me.

34:29.568 --> 34:31.703
You have amazing taste.

34:31.737 --> 34:33.772
I'm gonna go to bed
in a few minutes.

34:35.341 --> 34:38.244
I mean, she's totally nice, just

34:38.277 --> 34:39.710
a bit much right now.

34:39.745 --> 34:42.313
Yeah, we'll keep it short.

34:42.348 --> 34:44.550
Well, we're so glad
that you're all right.

34:44.583 --> 34:47.253
I hope it's okay that
we invited ourselves over.

34:47.286 --> 34:49.420
No, no, it's very sweet.

34:49.455 --> 34:53.458
And bringing chocolate
makes everything okay, so...

34:53.492 --> 34:56.228
You know, I have this very
strong feeling about you guys.

34:56.262 --> 34:58.397
Like, we're supposed
to be friends, you know?

34:58.430 --> 35:00.566
- Something in your gut.
- Yeah, exactly.

35:00.599 --> 35:02.634
I mean, we kind of match,
don't we?

35:02.668 --> 35:04.603
You and Xavier
are both big stars.

35:04.636 --> 35:06.605
Megan and I are
both on the rise.

35:06.638 --> 35:09.208
Baby, it's not just about
where we're all at with work.

35:09.241 --> 35:10.609
You're right.

35:10.642 --> 35:12.620
I'm just waiting to find out
if they're gonna make me

35:12.644 --> 35:14.280
a series regular, so...

35:14.313 --> 35:15.447
Stressful.

35:15.481 --> 35:17.216
No, no, it's not.

35:17.249 --> 35:19.718
It's... it's all a blessing,
and I am just gonna let it go.

35:21.653 --> 35:25.424
So I have been told
that you have a Lavoie.

35:25.457 --> 35:26.701
Actually, to be honest,
I read about it.

35:26.725 --> 35:28.360
It's upstairs.

35:28.394 --> 35:29.495
You wanna see it?

35:29.528 --> 35:32.564
God, yes.

35:32.598 --> 35:37.503
- I'll... I'll wait here.
- Okay.

35:40.772 --> 35:43.609
We'll go in a minute.
I know you must be exhausted.

35:43.642 --> 35:45.644
It's okay.

35:45.677 --> 35:49.648
You know, before I humiliated
myself last night,

35:49.681 --> 35:51.717
I really enjoyed your set.

35:51.750 --> 35:53.885
I really am a very big fan.

35:53.919 --> 35:55.621
Thank you.

35:55.654 --> 35:57.523
You didn't humiliate yourself.

35:57.556 --> 35:59.491
And you didn't just lie
to make me feel better.

36:08.367 --> 36:10.669
Not me. Kyle.

36:10.702 --> 36:12.271
Hey, you think he'd mind?

36:12.304 --> 36:13.805
Not at all.

36:13.839 --> 36:15.750
I would've offered, I just
thought you might get tired

36:15.774 --> 36:17.409
of people asking you to play.

36:17.443 --> 36:19.311
Nope, I'ma get worried

36:19.345 --> 36:21.513
if people stop
asking me to play.

36:26.352 --> 36:28.820
It's a very interesting choice.

36:30.789 --> 36:35.727
To put a piece with such
strong energy here.

36:35.761 --> 36:37.729
In the bedroom.

36:37.763 --> 36:42.434
I never really thought
about it being anywhere else.

36:42.468 --> 36:44.803
I'm sure it's exactly
where it's supposed to be.

36:58.350 --> 37:00.619
So is this talent
of yours godgiven,

37:00.652 --> 37:01.853
or did you go to Juilliard?

37:01.887 --> 37:05.491
No, no Juilliard.

37:05.524 --> 37:07.559
My mom taught me to play.

37:07.593 --> 37:09.695
She must be amazing.

37:09.728 --> 37:11.630
Yeah, she was.

37:19.505 --> 37:20.639
Sweet 16.

37:21.940 --> 37:25.411
I was 19 when I lost my mom.

37:27.913 --> 37:31.417
We were far too young

37:31.450 --> 37:34.886
To suddenly be so old

37:45.697 --> 37:49.368
Whenever I was sick,
or feeling bad,

37:49.401 --> 37:53.772
I put my ear on the piano
where Mom played and sang,

37:53.805 --> 37:56.442
I'd feel the strings vibrating.

37:56.475 --> 37:59.478
The click of the pedal.

37:59.511 --> 38:02.514
Her voice.

38:02.548 --> 38:05.784
I could feel all of it.

38:05.817 --> 38:08.787
Always made me feel better.

38:15.727 --> 38:18.864
Hey.

38:24.970 --> 38:27.573
Have you ever acted before?

38:36.147 --> 38:40.419
All right, let's go.

38:40.452 --> 38:41.787
Can I DJ?

38:41.820 --> 38:43.389
Sure.

38:43.422 --> 38:46.692
- Sweet.
- Um... first...

38:46.725 --> 38:49.661
Um...

38:49.695 --> 38:51.730
I have to give you this.

38:53.432 --> 38:56.668
It's a blindfold.

38:56.702 --> 38:59.371
I... I can take you
to the Facility,

38:59.405 --> 39:01.507
but I can't let you know
where it is.

39:03.742 --> 39:06.945
Of course, I do. It's just...

39:06.978 --> 39:10.081
You're not authorized.

39:10.115 --> 39:11.817
I'm the inhouse counsel.

39:11.850 --> 39:13.127
I'm sure Terence
wouldn't mind me

39:13.151 --> 39:15.153
knowing where
the Facility is, right?

39:15.186 --> 39:17.723
You're not authorized.

39:21.092 --> 39:24.530
Do you, um, still wanna go?

39:24.563 --> 39:27.899
Yeah! Let's go.

39:27.933 --> 39:29.067
Take me away, captain.

39:46.485 --> 39:49.455
Hey. Do you need to shower?

39:49.488 --> 39:50.856
Eventually.

39:50.889 --> 39:54.192
But I can wait till after lunch.

40:30.996 --> 40:33.765
It's a free country,
for people like you anyway.

40:35.534 --> 40:37.178
People who can pretend
they don't have problems.

40:37.202 --> 40:38.904
You don't know anything about...

40:38.937 --> 40:40.772
Those aren't the lines.
He's improvising.

40:40.806 --> 40:43.542
He's a jazz musician.
Kyle'll work with him.

40:43.575 --> 40:45.152
Well, I don't need to talk
to a therapist or a thief

40:45.176 --> 40:46.812
about my shit.

40:46.845 --> 40:48.089
He's got something
undeniable, though.

40:48.113 --> 40:49.948
And a whole lot
of buzz right now.

40:49.981 --> 40:51.817
It's actually kind of genius.

40:53.652 --> 40:55.153
Well, Kyle's happy.

40:55.186 --> 40:58.924
Jason and Vic are happy.
So yeah, I'm happy.

40:58.957 --> 41:01.259
Good, we'll have
a productive session then.

41:01.292 --> 41:06.164
I cancelled with Bella.

41:06.197 --> 41:08.233
Yeah.

41:08.266 --> 41:10.035
I have a backlog
of work right now,

41:10.068 --> 41:11.870
and honestly,
I don't think we need it.

41:11.903 --> 41:15.607
Okay, did we have sex at some
point that I'm not aware of?

41:17.242 --> 41:20.546
We'll get there. I promise.

41:20.579 --> 41:23.248
Look, for me, it's just
the stress of this movie

41:23.281 --> 41:25.216
more than anything else.

41:25.250 --> 41:29.521
But things are headed
in the right direction again.

41:34.192 --> 41:35.827
It's not the sex
that he's missing.

41:35.861 --> 41:37.162
It's having things his way.

41:37.195 --> 41:39.831
Control.

41:39.865 --> 41:43.068
Personally, I'd miss the sex.

41:43.101 --> 41:44.536
What? It's just easier.

41:44.570 --> 41:47.973
Why make things complicated?

41:48.006 --> 41:49.975
You make everything easier.

42:01.019 --> 42:02.554
I said don't look at me!

42:27.746 --> 42:31.016
Look who's back from the dead.

42:31.049 --> 42:32.293
Did you come to tell me
what a brilliant idea

42:32.317 --> 42:33.885
Xavier Hughes is?

42:33.919 --> 42:37.022
No, actually,
I came to talk to Megan.

42:37.055 --> 42:39.157
About what happened to you.

42:39.190 --> 42:40.626
It's not just stress.

42:40.659 --> 42:43.128
Not when your
entire body shuts down.

42:43.161 --> 42:45.263
Something else is going on.
Something destructive.

42:45.296 --> 42:46.965
And I think you
and I should work together

42:46.998 --> 42:49.167
until we figure out what it is.

42:49.200 --> 42:50.745
Terence, we start
rehearsals tomorrow.

42:50.769 --> 42:52.303
Kyle, it's okay.

42:54.973 --> 42:56.708
I think it's a great idea.
