-Tell me where you are.

18:44.291 --> 18:46.916
-How do you know about the notebook?
-I know all about the notebook.

18:48.416 --> 18:49.250
From who?

18:49.333 --> 18:51.958
There is someone here
you might want to talk to.

18:52.041 --> 18:54.041
[suspenseful music playing]

18:54.666 --> 18:55.916
[yelps] Segev.

18:56.833 --> 18:58.958
-Naomi. Hey.
-[Naomi] I'm sorry.

18:59.041 --> 19:02.041
-Talk.
-You listen good.

19:02.125 --> 19:04.916
She's innocent, let her go.
It's all on me.

19:05.000 --> 19:06.875
You hear me? I'll get you what you want.

19:07.458 --> 19:09.083
I'll give you the notebook.

19:10.375 --> 19:11.208
Okay.

19:11.291 --> 19:15.291
This is what's gonna happen now.
Get to Exit 135 on Westside Highway.

19:15.375 --> 19:17.083
Be there at 11:00.

19:35.791 --> 19:37.791

[narrator on TV] The 18-footer shows up.
The cage may not be enough to stop it.

19:50.750 --> 19:53.500
And pretty quickly
it becomes clear that what they...

19:53.583 --> 19:54.958
Goddamn it.

20:12.250 --> 20:13.500
I need your help, man.

20:17.000 --> 20:18.250
What the fuck do you want?

20:18.333 --> 20:21.250
And could you please not bleed
all over my floor, asshole?

20:25.291 --> 20:26.625
They killed my wife.

20:28.708 --> 20:30.291
And now they wanna kill me.

20:31.625 --> 20:32.833
I need your help.

20:34.416 --> 20:37.958
You fucked up or what, huh?
You put me in prison.

20:38.625 --> 20:40.333
Nine years, you goddamn fucker.

20:40.416 --> 20:44.166
You want me to help you?
Why not ask your friends at the CIA?

20:44.250 --> 20:45.500
Fuck the CIA.

20:46.250 --> 20:49.416
And fuck the Mossad.
They tried to frame you.

20:50.541 --> 20:52.333
I need weapons and I need people.

20:56.125 --> 20:57.750
You know what? You deserve this.

20:58.291 --> 21:00.208
You're a traitor, you'll never change.

21:06.958 --> 21:07.833
Issac.

21:07.916 --> 21:12.041
Sorry, Segev,
but I don't volunteer for wars anymore.

21:14.083 --> 21:15.583
The Mossad killed Ron.

21:17.291 --> 21:18.125
What?

21:19.625 --> 21:20.458
Ron...

21:22.833 --> 21:24.291
How do you know it was them?

21:25.208 --> 21:27.000
'Cause I killed his murderer.

21:29.583 --> 21:31.333
You owe Ron your life, Isaac.

21:33.291 --> 21:34.541
He saved you.

21:35.041 --> 21:38.291
Carried you on his back
for five kilometers in Lebanon.

21:38.375 --> 21:39.958
Everyone thought you were dead.

21:41.958 --> 21:43.916
But he didn't. Ron didn't give up.

21:44.791 --> 21:45.833
Remember that?

21:50.083 --> 21:51.208
It's just sad.

21:53.500 --> 21:57.000
That American girl has really
ruined your life.

21:59.291 --> 22:00.708
I hope she was worth it.

22:17.958 --> 22:19.208
[Danielle] Are you awake?

22:23.041 --> 22:24.083
I love you.

Do you love me?

I need to know.

22:44.625 --> 22:45.583
Please.

22:47.083 --> 22:48.083
I love you.

22:50.708 --> 22:52.250
I love you more than anything.

22:55.083 --> 22:56.750
I just don't want you to leave.

Come with me.

She's not home?
She left the office a couple hours ago.

24:10.791 --> 24:12.041
Know where she was going?

24:12.666 --> 24:15.125
She just ran out for an hour.
She never came back.

Yeah. Newkirk.

24:32.208 --> 24:34.458
My name's Henry Donenfeld.
I'm married to Naomi Hicks.

24:34.541 --> 24:36.625
Great. Why are you calling me?

24:37.541 --> 24:40.583
Because Naomi's missing
and your fucking card is on her desk.

24:40.666 --> 24:42.250
Do you know Segev Azulai?

24:43.958 --> 24:45.500
Hold on for a second.

24:45.583 --> 24:46.666
Don't hang up.

24:46.750 --> 24:49.833
Give me a sec. Where are you at?
Let me know where I can meet you.

24:53.583 --> 24:54.416
Here.

24:58.666 --> 24:59.958
-Eat.
-I'm not hungry.

25:00.541 --> 25:01.708
Well, I am.

25:07.666 --> 25:12.541
Have you ever met Danielle Wexler
or Sophie Dreyer or whatever her name was?

25:13.458 --> 25:14.291
Hmm?

25:15.500 --> 25:16.750
She was beautiful.

25:18.000 --> 25:20.458
I don't blame Azulai
for falling for her bullshit.

25:22.666 --> 25:24.833
So, what did he tell you about her? Hmm?

25:26.500 --> 25:29.625
Did he tell you she was having
an affair with another man?

25:30.708 --> 25:34.375
A liaison to the Israeli
National Security Adviser,

25:34.458 --> 25:36.250
while they were still married.

25:39.458 --> 25:40.833
Well, probably not.

25:42.416 --> 25:45.125
That's not the kind of thing
a man likes to share.

25:45.208 --> 25:46.416
[chuckles]

25:46.500 --> 25:48.166
So you're with the Mossad?

25:49.750 --> 25:52.958
Pretty sure you're not supposed
to be operating in this country.

25:54.416 --> 25:56.583
Kidnapping American journalists.

25:58.500 --> 26:01.500
Or spying on the president
of the United States.

26:03.000 --> 26:06.583
Is that what you think?
Is that what your research tells you?

26:09.875 --> 26:12.083
That must be some article you're writing.

26:12.166 --> 26:13.125
It is.

26:13.916 --> 26:16.708
And it doesn't make Israel look very good,

26:16.791 --> 26:18.458
spying on your best friend.

26:19.166 --> 26:21.666
Well, I wish it was that simple, my dear.

26:22.541 --> 26:25.375
What do you think
the CIA has been doing in Israel

26:25.458 --> 26:27.250
for the last 73 years?

26:29.416 --> 26:32.875
It's not neighborly
to spy on your best friends, I agree.

26:33.583 --> 26:36.833
But what if our illegal actions led
to a discovery

26:36.916 --> 26:40.166
of a devastating national security crisis?

26:41.375 --> 26:42.208
Hmm?

26:43.666 --> 26:48.708
A crisis in our friend's... government.

26:49.125 --> 26:51.333
Then what does a friend do?

26:53.750 --> 26:55.375
It has to do with the president.

26:56.583 --> 26:57.708
Or his family.

26:59.958 --> 27:02.375
So, what is it? What did you discover?

27:04.916 --> 27:08.916
The president's son-in-law
selling secrets to a foreign adversary.

27:15.250 --> 27:18.541
Think you can stop New York Magazine
from publishing this story?

27:20.416 --> 27:24.083
Killing an American spy in Israel
is nothing compared

27:24.166 --> 27:27.125
to messing with an American journalist
in her own country.

27:29.416 --> 27:31.333
You sure don't want any of this?

I'm still not really sure.
But this place isn't safe anymore.

29:45.291 --> 29:47.833
I've been targeted
by the Mossad or the Shabak.

29:47.916 --> 29:49.041
[Shira] What do you mean?

29:49.541 --> 29:52.416
They're listening to my calls.
'Cause of Segev.

29:52.500 --> 29:53.916
This place just isn't safe for you.

29:54.000 --> 29:56.708
Oh, no, no, no, Tali. Not again.

29:58.000 --> 30:01.333
Now the Mossad's after you?
You're just as crazy as Segev.

30:02.708 --> 30:04.958
How long am I supposed
to stay away from work?

30:05.041 --> 30:07.416
We've been stuck here for over a week.

30:07.500 --> 30:11.375
Ella's already bored.
This mess has to end.

30:12.208 --> 30:15.291
-Shira, we have to leave Israel.
-Are you crazy?

30:16.375 --> 30:19.125
What is this now?
What, a James Bond series?

30:20.416 --> 30:24.541
And shouldn't Segev be home soon?
Why are we even hiding?

30:24.625 --> 30:26.416
Who told you he's coming back?

30:26.500 --> 30:28.583
I don't know. Haven't you guys talked?

30:30.000 --> 30:31.500
No, I can't reach his number.

30:32.916 --> 30:35.958
That's why I really think we should go,
at least until he calls

30:36.041 --> 30:38.166
or if we know everything's really safe.

30:38.750 --> 30:42.041
Tali, listen, I truly appreciate
what you're doing for us.

30:42.125 --> 30:45.125
But I'm done with this bullshit and Segev.

30:45.625 --> 30:49.166
Tali, we are through.
I can't deal with this anymore.

30:53.000 --> 30:54.208
Sorry, you have to.

30:56.916 --> 30:58.416
We're not running anymore.

31:01.208 --> 31:02.041
Okay.

31:03.333 --> 31:05.166
Hope you have a spare room for me.

31:07.875 --> 31:08.958
Really, Tali?

You go. I'll stay here
and clean things up.

-Mm-hm.

-Yes, I'll do it.

Yes.

No.

34:29.791 --> 34:32.541
[Tali] But we're not done discussing this.

You can keep talking if you want.
I'm not going anywhere.

-Good night.

-The sheep?

34:46.291 --> 34:49.750
Sure, they're in the horse.
We keep them away from the jackals.

34:51.708 --> 34:53.208
Wait. There's jackals here?

34:55.333 --> 34:57.250
Is there anything else
I need to worry about?

34:57.333 --> 34:58.708
Maybe a bat or two.

35:00.500 --> 35:01.333
Good.

-For my wife, Danielle.

39:51.208 --> 39:52.416
You killed her.

39:52.500 --> 39:54.958
She was a liar and a traitor.

She stole state secrets.

If she had left the country immediately,
we never would've found her.

I don't understand.

40:37.250 --> 40:38.375
You don't need to.

Drop the gun.

I can't go with you.
I can't. We should split up.
