00:24.190 --> 00:27.902
[Tomar-Tu] Welcome to the
Galactic Science Prison
of the Green Lantern Corps.

00:27.986 --> 00:30.113
I'm probationary
Lantern Tomar-Tu.

00:30.196 --> 00:32.282
My Ring is now
translating for us.

00:32.365 --> 00:36.161
Please remain still
for a routine identity scan.

00:36.244 --> 00:37.704
[Ring] Scanning subject.

00:38.413 --> 00:39.330
Scanning...

00:40.081 --> 00:41.166
Scanning...

00:41.249 --> 00:42.417
[Tomar-Tu] I'm sorry.

00:42.500 --> 00:44.377
It doesn't usually
take this long.

00:44.461 --> 00:47.297
-No hurry.
-[Ring] Subject unknown.

00:47.380 --> 00:50.008
Species, Daxamite.

00:50.091 --> 00:51.134
No criminal record.

00:51.217 --> 00:52.969
Ah, there we go.

00:53.052 --> 00:54.679
How may the Corps
be of service?

00:54.763 --> 00:57.724
I understand that the worst
of the worst are kept here?

00:57.807 --> 00:59.601
Indeed, sir. That's very true.

00:59.684 --> 01:02.520
I wanted to make an inquiry
about one of your inmates.

01:02.604 --> 01:05.732
I believe he's known as
the "Kaizer-Thrall."

01:05.815 --> 01:08.860
Ring, search,
Kaizer-Thrall.

01:08.943 --> 01:10.695
"Kaizer-Thrall" has been
released

01:10.779 --> 01:14.240
and is en route to
its planet of origin. Earth.

01:14.324 --> 01:16.743
Ah! What else
can you tell me?

01:16.826 --> 01:18.828
Um, nothing. Sorry.

01:18.912 --> 01:21.706
The Thrall's status here
is a matter of public record.

01:21.790 --> 01:24.209
Anything else is confidential.

01:24.292 --> 01:26.294
Privacy concerns and all that.

01:26.377 --> 01:27.337
I understand.

01:30.715 --> 01:32.675
I believe
I knew your father.

01:32.759 --> 01:34.385
Really?

01:34.469 --> 01:37.847
He was a Green Lantern
of impressive skill
and willpower.

01:37.931 --> 01:39.766
May you follow
in his footsteps.

01:40.767 --> 01:42.185
Thank you!

01:42.268 --> 01:45.688

02:29.482 --> 02:31.651
[Nightwing]<i> Anyone got eyes</i>
<i>on S.B?</i>

02:31.734 --> 02:33.444
[Kaldur'ahm]<i> Nothing.</i>

02:33.528 --> 02:35.405
[Zatanna sighs]<i> No sign.</i>

02:35.488 --> 02:37.073
[Tigress]<i> You sure</i>
<i>these Kryptonians don't</i>
<i>have superpowers?</i>

02:37.156 --> 02:39.325
[Nightwing]<i> No yellow sun,</i>
<i>no powers.</i>

02:39.409 --> 02:40.994
<i>But don't get cocky.</i>

02:41.077 --> 02:42.745
<i>They've been here a long time</i>
<i>and know the ropes.</i>

02:42.829 --> 02:45.748
<i>If they spot us,</i>
<i>we'll all feel the mode.</i>

02:45.832 --> 02:47.834
<i>Wait! There he is.</i>

02:47.917 --> 02:49.210
[Rocket]<i> We see him.</i>

02:49.294 --> 02:50.795
<i>-Do we move in?</i>
-[Nightwing]<i> Not yet.</i>

02:53.673 --> 02:55.925
<i>Okay. He's alone</i>
<i>in the open. Converge.</i>

02:57.343 --> 02:58.303
Conner.

02:59.762 --> 03:03.182
Not bad.
Sounding pretty Big Blue.

03:03.266 --> 03:04.350
Like a leader.

03:04.434 --> 03:06.144
We both know
that's not my role.

03:13.776 --> 03:17.530
[Superboy growls]
Zone-Sickness. Hallucinations.
Ignore them.

03:17.614 --> 03:19.657
Conner, it's us.
We're real.

03:19.741 --> 03:20.950
We're here
to take you home.

03:21.034 --> 03:21.951
[Dru-Zod] Oh, really.

03:26.331 --> 03:28.750
Then you must have
a way out of here.

03:29.417 --> 03:30.919
Do tell!

03:32.879 --> 03:37.175
[computer]<i> Recognized</i>
<i>Miss Martian, B-0-5.</i>

03:37.258 --> 03:40.678
-You rang?
-Miss Martian,
allow me to introduce--

03:40.762 --> 03:42.305
Forager!

03:42.388 --> 03:44.140
Forager's told me
so much about you.
Does he know you're here?

03:44.223 --> 03:45.600
He'll be so excited.

03:45.683 --> 03:48.311
And Forager is excited
to see Forager as well.

03:48.394 --> 03:53.524
But first, Forager has to
attend to Forager's
Green Lantern Corps business.

03:53.608 --> 03:57.570
This Kaizer-Thrall is known
as the Kaizer-Thrall.

03:57.654 --> 04:02.450
On New Genesis,
Kaizer-Thrall was discovered
to possess sentience.

04:02.533 --> 04:05.286
Green Lantern Forager
and Green Lantern Kilowog

04:05.370 --> 04:10.249
removed Kaizer-Thrall
to Oa, where Green Lantern
Soranik Natu

04:10.333 --> 04:14.295
discovered that Kaizer-Thrall's
Apokoliptan exo-shell

04:14.379 --> 04:19.175
contains Kaizer-Thrall's
<i>living human brain.</i>

04:19.258 --> 04:21.219
<i>C'eridy'all...</i>

04:21.302 --> 04:24.347
We were hoping you could
establish communication.

04:24.430 --> 04:25.390
Of course.

04:27.600 --> 04:28.977
He's human, all right.

04:29.852 --> 04:31.270
Meta-human.

04:31.354 --> 04:33.815
His name is Danny Chase.

04:34.857 --> 04:36.693
Age eleven.

04:36.776 --> 04:41.114
<i>He was a runaway.</i>
<i>Abducted, tested, activated,</i>

04:41.197 --> 04:44.325
<i>trafficked...</i>
<i>to Apokolips...</i>

04:44.409 --> 04:47.537
-[Desaad laughs]
-[Miss Martian]
Where he was given to Desaad...

04:47.620 --> 04:52.542
who cut his brain out
and put it in this box.

04:52.625 --> 04:53.835
[Forager clicks sadly]
Barbaric.

04:53.918 --> 04:56.045
Apokoliptans
and their damn boxes.

04:58.172 --> 05:04.679
Danny has telekinesis
as well as some
multi-dimensional abilities,

05:04.762 --> 05:07.432
which cause him
extreme pain,

05:07.515 --> 05:10.977
or not just pain...

05:11.060 --> 05:13.229
I think they're...
I think they're killing him.

05:13.312 --> 05:14.897
[Kaizer-Thrall beeps]

05:14.981 --> 05:17.400
Oh, I'm sorry.
He'd like to talk to us
face to face.

05:19.736 --> 05:20.778
[Danny] Hey.

05:22.322 --> 05:23.781
I'm Danny.

05:24.532 --> 05:26.117
Danny Chase.

05:26.200 --> 05:29.495
Forager is happy
to meet Danny Chase.

05:29.579 --> 05:32.331
We are so sorry
this happened to you.

05:33.041 --> 05:34.125
S' okay.

05:34.208 --> 05:36.044
Or, you know,
it's not your fault.

05:36.127 --> 05:38.671
I'm so happy
y'all can see me.

05:39.380 --> 05:40.631
[sighs]

05:40.715 --> 05:42.592
See who I really am.

05:42.675 --> 05:44.343
We see you, Danny.

05:44.427 --> 05:48.848
And I swear we will do
everything in our power
to help you.

05:48.931 --> 05:51.809

05:56.731 --> 05:59.275

<i>Though I do not wish</i>

06:05.073 --> 06:08.367

06:12.455 --> 06:14.082
[Superboy] Then they're real.

06:14.916 --> 06:16.000
You see them too?

06:16.084 --> 06:17.085
Indeed.

06:18.377 --> 06:19.837
[laughs wickedly]

06:19.921 --> 06:21.964
Come on, guys.
One picture of the whole Team

06:22.048 --> 06:24.967
before Roy joins the League
and gets too good for us.

06:25.051 --> 06:28.471
Who exactly is supposed
to take this pic?
We're the only ones here.

06:28.554 --> 06:29.514
I can do it!

06:33.476 --> 06:35.394
Yeah, you can.

06:42.610 --> 06:45.905
We have nothing here,
nothing but each other.

06:46.614 --> 06:48.157
[Superboy grunts]

06:48.241 --> 06:51.494
I calculated
using the Superboy
as bait would pay off.

06:51.577 --> 06:53.913
I've been expecting
another attempt
to retrieve him

06:53.996 --> 06:57.166
ever since that Ghosty escaped
from the Zone.

06:57.250 --> 06:59.794
Now you people
will release us all.

06:59.877 --> 07:01.170
No problem.

07:01.254 --> 07:03.631
Any friend of Superboy
is a friend of ours.

07:03.714 --> 07:08.177
Superboy, does this
friend of yours
speak the truth?

07:09.679 --> 07:10.721
No.

07:10.805 --> 07:13.015
-Conner.
-They're trying to play us.

07:13.099 --> 07:16.185
They must learn
the House of Zod does not play.

07:16.269 --> 07:18.104
The House of Zod<i> conquers.</i>

07:18.187 --> 07:20.106
<i>Conner, these are criminals.</i>

07:20.189 --> 07:23.860
<i>The worst of the worst</i>
<i>placed here by Kryptonians</i>
<i>decades ago.</i>

07:23.943 --> 07:27.613
<i>You cannot side with them</i>
<i>against your oldest friends.</i>

07:27.697 --> 07:29.699
<i>Remember who you are.</i>

07:29.782 --> 07:31.409
<i>What we've all meant</i>
<i>each other.</i>

07:31.492 --> 07:35.204
-[Superboy]<i> It's all broken.</i>
<i>-That can be fixed.</i>

07:35.288 --> 07:38.291
<i>Trust me, I know.</i>

07:38.374 --> 07:39.750
<i>M'gann can help you.</i>

07:39.834 --> 07:42.795
I know you can find
your way back to me.

07:42.879 --> 07:44.297
I believe in you Conner.

07:44.380 --> 07:47.675
[Superboy] No! I could never
go back to M'gann.

07:47.758 --> 07:48.885
Why would you say that?

07:48.968 --> 07:50.261
[Superboy] Because
I might hurt her.

07:50.344 --> 07:51.596
You would never do that.

07:51.679 --> 07:52.638
I would.

07:53.347 --> 07:54.432
I'm a weapon,

07:55.099 --> 07:56.434
a killer.

07:58.227 --> 07:59.604
I killed Superman.

08:05.359 --> 08:06.777
[computer]<i> Recognized.</i>

08:06.861 --> 08:08.863
<i>Superman 0-1.</i>

08:08.946 --> 08:11.532
All right, I'm here.
Let's do this.

08:11.616 --> 08:14.660
Moving the Watchtower
above Earth's Zeta-Shield.

08:21.292 --> 08:22.335
Good to go.

08:22.418 --> 08:23.920
Prince J'emm,
we're ready here.

<i>Phantom Girl A-5-1.</i>

08:35.014 --> 08:37.808
Prince J'emm J'axx of M'arzz,
you've met Superman.

08:37.892 --> 08:43.856
Allow me to introduce Aquaman,
Black Lightning, Green Lantern,
and Danny Chase.

08:43.940 --> 08:47.443
<i>I am most pleased</i>
<i>to make your acquaintances.</i>

08:47.526 --> 08:49.445
<i>This young alien female,</i>

08:49.528 --> 08:53.407
<i>who, in the style</i>
<i>of your world,</i>
<i>calls herself "Phantom Girl,"</i>

08:53.491 --> 08:56.786
<i>has an incredible story</i>
<i>that you need to hear.</i>

08:56.869 --> 08:58.287
Thank you, Prince J'emm.

08:58.371 --> 09:01.749
<i>To be clear, she has not fully</i>
<i>opened her mind to me.</i>

09:01.832 --> 09:05.378
<i>But to the extent she has,</i>
<i>I believe she speaks the truth.</i>

09:05.461 --> 09:08.297
<i>Or at the very least,</i>
<i>she believes she does.</i>

09:08.381 --> 09:10.049
Thank you, Prince J'emm.

09:10.132 --> 09:13.970
<i>Please allow me to create</i>
<i>a psychic link to her mind.</i>

09:14.053 --> 09:15.513
[Phantom Girl]
<i>I'll cut right to it.</i>

09:15.596 --> 09:18.015
<i>When the bomb went off</i>
<i>on Mars, I was there</i>

09:18.099 --> 09:23.980
<i>and managed to save Superboy</i>
<i>using my ability to phase,</i>
<i>to make us both intangible.</i>

09:24.063 --> 09:28.484
<i>But somehow,</i>
<i>I also transported us</i>
<i>to a buffer dimension</i>

09:28.567 --> 09:29.986
<i>called the Phantom Zone.</i>

09:30.069 --> 09:32.113
<i>The journey</i>
<i>left me unconscious.</i>

09:32.196 --> 09:35.658
<i>And while I was out,</i>
<i>Superboy fell under</i>
<i>the influence of a pair</i>

09:35.741 --> 09:39.620
<i>of dangerous</i>
<i>Kryptonian criminals named Zod.</i>

09:39.704 --> 09:43.874
<i>They have a hold over him</i>
<i>I don't understand.</i>

09:43.958 --> 09:45.334
<i>He wouldn't leave.</i>

09:45.418 --> 09:48.504
So I asked Prince J'emm
to help me find you.

09:48.587 --> 09:52.133
I think you're the only one
who can bring him back.

09:52.216 --> 09:55.219
And you must bring him back.

09:55.303 --> 09:56.429
Can...

09:56.512 --> 09:57.763
Can this be true?

10:05.271 --> 10:07.606
I have reason to believe it is.

10:17.116 --> 10:18.659
[Ma'alefa'ak]
<i>What are you up to?</i>

10:18.743 --> 10:21.287
There was a third Legionnaire
with these two.

10:21.370 --> 10:24.999
I don't like not knowing
where she is
or what she's up to.

10:25.082 --> 10:27.543
These rings act as
communication devices.

10:27.626 --> 10:30.338
If we can hack them,
we can locate her.

10:30.421 --> 10:33.132
Perhaps even listen in
without her knowledge.

10:33.215 --> 10:36.385
[Ma'alefa'ak]<i> Or perhaps</i>
<i>there's a simpler solution.</i>

10:44.477 --> 10:50.816
<i>No signal from Kid Flash D04,</i>
<i>Nightwing B01,</i>

10:50.900 --> 10:52.985
<i>Zatanna 25.</i>

10:53.069 --> 10:57.948
Um, Phantom Girl,
have you been able
to reach your two friends?

10:58.032 --> 11:00.409
How do you know about them?

11:00.493 --> 11:02.453
I can't answer that right now.

11:02.536 --> 11:04.580
But please answer me.

11:04.663 --> 11:09.585
No, I haven't
been able to reach them,
which is extremely concerning.

11:09.668 --> 11:13.422
And also the main reason
why I have come
to you people for help.

11:13.506 --> 11:16.425
Your turn.
What aren't you telling us?

11:16.509 --> 11:20.805
Not yet. I'm sorry,
but I need you
to trust me until I know more.

11:20.888 --> 11:26.477
So, Conner's alive,
injured and so troubled
he wouldn't return with you?

11:26.560 --> 11:28.521
-Yes.
-Please take me to him.

11:28.604 --> 11:30.564
I'm sure I can convince him
to come home.

11:30.648 --> 11:32.274
That's what I'm counting on.

11:32.358 --> 11:34.652
But there's a problem.

11:34.735 --> 11:37.613
I'm honestly not sure
if I can get back to the Zone.

11:37.697 --> 11:42.827
I got there by accident,
and I'm not great
at phasing other people anyway.

11:42.910 --> 11:44.286
But it's okay.

11:44.370 --> 11:47.164
There is a Phantom Zone
Projector on New Genesis.

11:47.248 --> 11:48.624
No longer.

11:48.707 --> 11:52.878
The New Genesis Phantom Zone
Projector was destroyed.

11:55.131 --> 11:56.924
All right, we'll try.

11:59.051 --> 12:00.594
You sure about this?

12:00.678 --> 12:03.347
Am I sure about doing whatever
I must to get Conner back?

12:03.431 --> 12:05.307
Do you really have to ask?

12:10.813 --> 12:12.815
[thunder claps]

12:14.191 --> 12:16.152
Is this the Phantom Zone?

12:16.235 --> 12:19.655
No. It's Bgtzl. My homeworld.

12:19.738 --> 12:22.533
Bgtzl in the 21st century.

12:22.616 --> 12:25.619
In my time there's
a sparkling city here.

12:25.703 --> 12:28.747
I must've... overshot the Zone.

12:28.831 --> 12:30.624
Can we try again?

12:30.708 --> 12:34.211
I'll link with you psychically,
help you focus on Conner
and the Zone.

12:34.295 --> 12:35.171
Let's do it

12:36.046 --> 12:37.590
[thunder claps]

12:40.384 --> 12:41.510
[both gasp]

12:41.594 --> 12:42.678
M'gann.

12:42.761 --> 12:44.805
I'm sorry.

12:44.889 --> 12:46.765
I'm so sorry

12:51.770 --> 12:52.813
Conner.

12:52.897 --> 12:54.648
You didn't kill Superman.

12:55.399 --> 12:56.358
He's not dead.

12:58.944 --> 13:00.404
The son of Jor-El lives?

13:00.488 --> 13:04.074
Yes. We saw him just before
we came here.

13:04.158 --> 13:05.951
This one told us
Kal-El was dead.

13:06.035 --> 13:07.912
He also told us Krypton
was destroyed.

13:07.995 --> 13:12.416
-Was that true?
-Yes, over 40 years ago.

13:12.500 --> 13:14.084
I am sorry.

13:14.168 --> 13:17.421
Then our sentences
in this hellscape
will last an eternity.

13:17.505 --> 13:20.424
We can create
a probationary court.

13:20.508 --> 13:22.843
Consider each
of your cases, individually.

13:22.927 --> 13:24.762
Yes,<i> we can do</i> that.

13:24.845 --> 13:27.389
<i>After we've</i> been released
from the Zone.

13:27.473 --> 13:29.683
We've already served
our full sentences.

13:29.767 --> 13:32.561
So release us now
as a show of good faith.

13:37.733 --> 13:39.652
I see.

13:39.735 --> 13:43.614
You don't want to release us
because you fear our power
under your yellow sun.

13:43.697 --> 13:45.908
Not much has changed
in 40 years.

13:45.991 --> 13:51.080
The House of El and
the Kryptonian High Council
feared my power, too.

13:51.163 --> 13:53.249
That's why we're here.

13:53.332 --> 13:56.126
But if we can't leave,
you won't either.

13:56.210 --> 13:57.419
That's so not up to you.

13:57.503 --> 14:01.257
Isn't it?
Superboy, contain her.

14:05.052 --> 14:06.387
Conner, stop!

14:06.470 --> 14:07.638
We are trying to help you.

14:11.600 --> 14:13.602
Take them, secure them all.

14:19.650 --> 14:20.859

What?

15:01.400 --> 15:02.651
Whom do you serve?

15:02.735 --> 15:04.778
I serve the House of Zod.

15:04.862 --> 15:05.738
Prove it.

15:21.253 --> 15:22.838
Fools.

15:22.921 --> 15:25.966
Given all our years
in the Zone,
training for this moment,

15:26.050 --> 15:28.969
how could you believe
you could best my forces?

15:29.762 --> 15:30.929
<i>Erif--</i>

15:37.853 --> 15:42.399
Now, I believe you were
showing us the way out.

15:43.942 --> 15:45.944
This just can't be happening.

15:46.028 --> 15:49.323
How can Conner be alive
and still out of reach?

15:49.406 --> 15:51.283
[Kaizer-Thrall beeping]

15:52.242 --> 15:53.744
Really?

15:53.827 --> 15:56.246
I better link us again.

15:56.330 --> 15:59.041
Danny says he knows
the location
of the Phantom Zone.

15:59.124 --> 16:02.044
Uh, yeah. See, when
the Zone opened on New Genesis,

16:02.127 --> 16:06.006
I was able to
lock on to its unique
trans-dimensional frequency.

16:06.090 --> 16:08.550
I can't get you there,
but I can guide you there.

16:08.634 --> 16:09.718
Maybe together?

16:09.802 --> 16:13.514
Sorry, no.
My powers are organic.

16:13.597 --> 16:15.974
I don't "do" frequencies.

16:16.058 --> 16:18.977
Even now,
psychically linked to Danny,

16:19.061 --> 16:20.854
his intel is meaningless to me.

16:20.938 --> 16:23.482
-What about a Motherbox?
-That could work.

16:23.565 --> 16:26.360
I've never linked with
a Motherbox, but I have
linked with Fatherboxes,

16:26.443 --> 16:28.070
and they're basically
the same thing, right?

16:28.153 --> 16:29.822
Basically. Just less evil.

16:29.905 --> 16:31.240
Wait a minute, wait a minute.

16:31.323 --> 16:33.242
This was the power
that hurt you,

16:33.325 --> 16:34.535
that was killing you.

16:34.618 --> 16:35.577
I can't ask you--

16:35.661 --> 16:37.705
I can manage it, one last time.

16:37.788 --> 16:40.457
To help you and your friend,
the way y'all are helping me.

16:40.541 --> 16:42.543
This does sound promising.

16:42.626 --> 16:44.586
But where do we
get a Motherbox?

16:44.670 --> 16:48.424
[computer]<i> Recognized.</i>
<i>Orion A-5-2.</i>

16:48.507 --> 16:50.843
Thank you for coming
on such short notice.

16:50.926 --> 16:53.429
Per our treaty,
I could do no less.

16:53.512 --> 16:55.264
But understand, if this works,

16:55.347 --> 16:58.100
we'll be opening a Boomtube
not only for your friend,

16:58.183 --> 17:01.061
but for every Kryptonian
criminal in the Zone.

17:01.145 --> 17:02.730
[Motherbox pings]

17:02.813 --> 17:06.442
So as a precaution,
I had Motherbox
locate Trombus,

17:06.525 --> 17:10.154
an uninhabited planet under
the red sun, Gamma Crucis.

17:10.237 --> 17:12.990
The planet has
an acceptable atmosphere.

17:13.073 --> 17:14.450
If we Boomtube there,

17:14.533 --> 17:17.202
we can safely open another
Boomtube to the Zone.

17:17.286 --> 17:21.749
If any criminals emerge,
they won't gain
yellow sun powers.

17:21.832 --> 17:24.418
And we should be able
to handle them. Thank you.

17:27.129 --> 17:30.632
Rocket's force bubbles
would be extremely useful.

17:30.716 --> 17:32.134
We should summon her.

17:32.217 --> 17:35.012
Actually, I tried to contact
Rocket and Nightwing.

17:35.095 --> 17:38.891
Tigress, Zatanna and Kaldur
to tell them about Conner.

17:38.974 --> 17:40.309
I couldn't reach any of them.

17:42.394 --> 17:44.146
Aquaman, hold down the fort.

17:45.230 --> 17:46.732
I know this isn't your fight.

17:46.815 --> 17:50.444
<i>But M'arzz is forever indebted</i>
<i>to Conner Kent.</i>

17:50.527 --> 17:54.656
And any friend of Forager
is a friend of Forager.

17:54.740 --> 17:56.408
Thanks. We appreciate the help.

17:56.492 --> 17:58.160
<i>Phantom Girl, are you there?</i>

17:58.243 --> 18:01.955
Cham?! Oh thank Bgztlqwar...

18:09.296 --> 18:11.840

[Kid Flash]<i> Right here,</i>

18:14.968 --> 18:17.179
[kid flash]<i> Uh, no.</i>
<i>Are they working this too?</i>

18:17.262 --> 18:20.516
Cham, Imra, I have so much
to tell you both.

18:20.599 --> 18:22.309
But here's the short version.

18:22.392 --> 18:24.186
Superboy is alive.

18:24.269 --> 18:26.688
[Chameleon Boy chuckles]
<i>That's great.</i>

18:26.772 --> 18:28.357
We are going
to the planet Trombus,

18:28.440 --> 18:30.150
to open the Phantom Zone
and rescue him.

18:30.234 --> 18:32.027
[Chameleon Boy]<i> Okay, good.</i>
<i>We're close.</i>

18:32.110 --> 18:33.111
<i>We'll meet you there.</i>

18:44.081 --> 18:45.541
[Nightwing] Didn't
want to do this.

18:51.046 --> 18:52.089
What is this?

18:52.172 --> 18:53.590
It's called Kryptonite.

18:53.674 --> 18:57.094
Deadly to any Kryptonian
or half-Kryptonian.

18:57.177 --> 18:58.804
But it doesn't seem
to work here.

18:59.721 --> 19:00.764
[Dru-Zod] No.

19:02.641 --> 19:04.309
It wouldn't.

[Nightwing]<i> Z, that was</i>
<i>my last trick.</i>

19:06.603 --> 19:09.106
<i>Can you just zap S.B.</i>
<i>into the school bus?</i>

19:09.189 --> 19:10.816
[Zatanna sighs]<i> Not if</i>
<i>he doesn't want to go.</i>

19:10.899 --> 19:13.318
<i>His will is acting</i>
<i>as an anchor to the Zone.</i>

19:13.402 --> 19:15.404
[Nightwing]<i> Well, we can't</i>
<i>save him and fight him.</i>

19:15.487 --> 19:17.698

draining away.

If there's a fight,
I won't be of much use.

19:49.271 --> 19:51.815
The other Kryptonians
won't have powers, either.

19:51.899 --> 19:53.901
Meanwhile, we have
two Martians,

19:53.984 --> 19:56.695
a Green Lantern, a New God,
and me.

19:56.778 --> 19:57.946
I think we'll be fine.

19:58.030 --> 19:59.448
You're sure you're okay
with this?

19:59.531 --> 20:01.116
You're certain
you're all right with this?

[Danny] No, keep going.
I can take it.

It's of New Genesis.

20:38.862 --> 20:40.113
Is that where it leads?

20:40.197 --> 20:41.657
It's called a Boomtube.

20:41.740 --> 20:42.866
It could lead anywhere.

20:42.950 --> 20:44.159
It could be a trap.

20:44.242 --> 20:46.620
Nevertheless, it's a way out.
