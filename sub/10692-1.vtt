00:59.500 --> 01:01.536
Fuck it! Shut up, all right?

01:02.780 --> 01:04.691
Listen, we gotta get in there,

01:04.940 --> 01:06.931
roll up, surprise him!

01:08.820 --> 01:11.778
You guys listening to me?
Hit him up, just get my money back!

01:12.020 --> 01:15.933
Get in and out in a couple fucking seconds.
It'll be all cool!

01:16.620 --> 01:19.578
- Nobody gets hurt, man!
- Yeah, nobody's gonna get hurt!

01:21.100 --> 01:22.977
You just gotta be cool...

01:23.700 --> 01:26.009
We'll be in and out in two seconds!

01:27.380 --> 01:30.338
- Boy, you fucking mind?
- He's got his fucking hands up her seat.

01:31.180 --> 01:32.852
We'll be back.

01:33.100 --> 01:35.011
Let's go. Let's do this!

01:35.260 --> 01:38.332
Come here, you be careful.

01:38.580 --> 01:41.652
- And watch out for him!
- What do you know? It's fine, sis!

01:46.020 --> 01:48.614
Hayden, stay behind me and Johnny, okay?

02:16.380 --> 02:18.336
- Give us the money, you bitch!
- What do you want?

02:19.220 --> 02:22.212
Give us the fucking cash!
Get 'em up! Put 'em up!

02:24.180 --> 02:26.614
Get the fuck out!
Hayden, get out of the way!

02:31.220 --> 02:34.053
Motherfucker! Fucker!

02:34.300 --> 02:36.052
Don't say anything.

02:36.340 --> 02:38.729
- Fuck you!
- You shot him!

02:38.980 --> 02:42.656
- I shot Hayden!
- Fuck, Hayden.

02:44.661 --> 02:46.652
- I'm sorry!
- You shot him!

02:49.021 --> 02:50.977
Fuck, is he dead? Is he dead?

02:51.421 --> 02:53.139
He's dead.

02:53.821 --> 02:55.777
He's dead, Johnny, we gotta get outta here!

02:56.301 --> 02:58.815
Johnny, we gotta get outta here!

03:02.741 --> 03:04.697
Johnny, come on, man!

03:18.021 --> 03:20.216
Shit! Fuck!

03:58.421 --> 04:00.730
- What's going on?
- Where's Johnny?

04:00.981 --> 04:03.131
- What happened?
- Where's Hayden?

04:03.381 --> 04:05.178
Where's Johnny?

04:07.781 --> 04:09.851
Where's Johnny?

04:10.101 --> 04:12.012
Is he listening to us? Where's Johnny?

04:12.261 --> 04:14.570
Johnny shot Hayden, they're dead.

04:16.701 --> 04:18.930
I'm sorry, they are dead!

04:20.421 --> 04:23.538
- What the fuck is that?
- Johnny shot Hayden...

04:23.781 --> 04:27.694
- Wait here, I'm gonna go get Johnny!
- You can't!

04:27.941 --> 04:29.818
He's dead, you're gonna get yourself...

04:30.061 --> 04:33.974
I got to go, I got to get Johnny!

04:34.221 --> 04:36.974
- No, we got to go.
- I'll do it myself.

04:37.221 --> 04:40.054
Don't drive away! Go get Johnny!
Don't go! Go get Johnny!

07:18.182 --> 07:20.901
Sport? What are you doing here?

07:21.862 --> 07:23.818
Supposed to be out in less than an hour?

07:24.542 --> 07:28.455
You know what the old-timers say: "Can't
stop diggin' a grave until you finish."

07:29.502 --> 07:31.697
It's a respect thing.

07:34.822 --> 07:37.894
These are the letters
you sent to your brother Stevey!

07:39.022 --> 07:41.297
They've come back for the past 3 months.

07:42.822 --> 07:45.734
I thought it was best to wait
till you go out.

07:52.982 --> 07:54.779
You did the right thing.

07:55.702 --> 07:57.533
This is Lou's address.

07:58.062 --> 08:00.098
I talked to him, he's expecting you.

08:02.382 --> 08:04.293
You gotta go slow with Lou...

08:04.742 --> 08:07.017
He's real private.

08:07.262 --> 08:09.935
Real to himself. You know what I'm saying?

08:10.182 --> 08:12.457
I understand, it's no problem.

08:19.822 --> 08:20.777
Listen...

08:21.382 --> 08:23.338
You ever need anything...

08:24.542 --> 08:27.693
Anybody to talk to, whatever,
you come see me.

08:27.942 --> 08:29.819
I got your number.

08:31.582 --> 08:33.573
You're gonna be all right.

09:33.583 --> 09:37.212
You think digging graves for 5 years,
settles your debt with my family?

09:38.063 --> 09:40.019
The fuck you talking about "debt"?

09:41.583 --> 09:44.655
Think you're just gonna walk free
and not pay for what you took away from me?

09:50.343 --> 09:51.298
Look...

09:54.263 --> 09:56.697
I can't deal with this right now.

09:57.343 --> 09:58.935
It'll have to wait.

10:00.183 --> 10:01.980
You're dead, Johnny.

10:02.823 --> 10:04.779
You're as dead as my brother.

10:17.223 --> 10:18.178
Lou?

10:18.943 --> 10:21.252
- Lou Reilly?
- Yes.

10:22.583 --> 10:24.778
I'm Johnny Miles.

10:30.263 --> 10:32.174
Come on, I'll show you your room.

10:41.503 --> 10:43.380
This is it.

10:45.383 --> 10:49.296
I know it's a little dirty.
I just been using it as a storage place.

10:49.543 --> 10:51.454
That's cool. Thanks.

10:52.223 --> 10:54.054
Listen, you don't have to...

10:54.303 --> 10:58.216
You don't have to get started right away.
Take a couple of days, get settled in.

11:00.743 --> 11:03.621
You know the fresh food market
over on Ninth Avenue?

11:04.503 --> 11:06.300
You know the neighborhood?

11:07.503 --> 11:09.653
It's been a while, but I know it.

11:11.663 --> 11:14.257
Do you need anything? A little advance?

11:14.503 --> 11:16.698
No, I'm set, thanks.

11:18.543 --> 11:21.740
All right, if you need anything,
you let me know.

11:25.823 --> 11:26.778
Shit.

11:33.703 --> 11:35.659
What's it like being a champ?

11:48.983 --> 11:51.497
Those things, they ain't nothing.

11:55.743 --> 11:57.495
They just there.

12:20.583 --> 12:22.539
Did you win all your fights in the joint?

12:26.223 --> 12:28.179
You look good.

12:30.423 --> 12:31.378
Here.

12:32.663 --> 12:34.221
Take it.

12:34.663 --> 12:37.814
- What's that?
- It's all the money, your money.

12:39.623 --> 12:41.579
I don't want it, it's blood money.

12:43.103 --> 12:45.412
You don't think I know how bad I fucked up?

12:47.103 --> 12:49.059
I'm just trying to straighten things out.

12:50.383 --> 12:52.339
This is yours, you deserve this.

12:53.183 --> 12:55.618
Money don't take the 5 years away, Patty.

12:56.144 --> 12:58.897
I ain't trying to take nothing away,
just set things straight.

13:00.024 --> 13:02.777
You did what you had to do
and I appreciate it.

13:03.024 --> 13:05.584
I think you should take this:
it's all you.

13:05.824 --> 13:07.621
I don't want it.

13:10.784 --> 13:12.820
Your mom told me to give this to you.

13:16.944 --> 13:18.900
She died peaceful.

13:19.784 --> 13:21.615
I gave her a good burial.

13:24.784 --> 13:26.581
Was Stevey there?

13:28.344 --> 13:29.299
No.

13:33.624 --> 13:36.502
You should have been there for him,
like I was there for you.

13:40.664 --> 13:42.620
I tried, but he was blowing crack.

13:43.344 --> 13:45.335
Who are you to talk about blowing crack?

13:46.144 --> 13:48.100
What are you, a saint or something?

13:48.744 --> 13:52.453
He was a kid, you were supposed
to look after him like I looked after you.

13:56.144 --> 13:57.896
Where is he?

13:58.304 --> 13:59.862
I don't know.

14:02.104 --> 14:04.538
My old man died and he left me the bar.

14:05.184 --> 14:08.699
- Just take the money, it's clean.
- Stop coming at me with money.

14:09.344 --> 14:11.141
I don't need it.

14:14.144 --> 14:16.100
But I'm sorry to hear about your pops.

14:17.344 --> 14:20.700
The fuck you sorry for?
Fuck him. He's dead.

14:20.944 --> 14:22.900
Why you talking about him like that?

14:24.104 --> 14:27.062
Why the fuck should I care?
He didn't care about anybody but himself.

14:28.384 --> 14:30.340
Why should I fucking care?

14:32.944 --> 14:35.663
If you need anything, money, a job,

14:37.064 --> 14:38.861
anything, will you come to me?

14:40.024 --> 14:41.935
I'm good, man.

14:47.544 --> 14:50.104
I'll set things straight
with you and Gloria.

14:50.544 --> 14:52.500
That would be nice.

14:55.824 --> 14:57.655
You look good.

15:50.824 --> 15:52.780
My dearest son Johnny,

15:53.104 --> 15:55.060
there is so much I have to tell you.

15:55.784 --> 15:59.140
I'm sorry I'm not well enough to come visit
and talk with you in person.

15:59.824 --> 16:02.896
I love you son. Jesus loves you, too.

16:03.744 --> 16:05.700
He knows you didn't mean to kill that boy.

16:06.104 --> 16:08.664
He forgives you,
like he forgives all his children.

16:09.464 --> 16:12.422
I pray to Him every day
to shed his light on your heart,

16:12.664 --> 16:14.620
so that you will see his way.

16:14.864 --> 16:18.140
Remember to take care of your brother
Stevey,

16:18.384 --> 16:19.976
he needs you.

16:20.225 --> 16:22.659
I'll always love you. Your loving mother.

17:54.025 --> 17:55.697
I love you.

18:05.865 --> 18:07.696
Why did you go see him?

18:12.065 --> 18:13.862
What, are you spying me?

18:14.745 --> 18:16.383
Maybe.

18:18.865 --> 18:20.776
You got to kill him for me.

18:57.825 --> 18:58.780
Spike?

18:59.905 --> 19:01.782
Who that? Who that calling me?

19:02.025 --> 19:04.619
It's me, Johnny. Seen Stevey?

19:04.865 --> 19:07.299
Can't you see I'm taking care of business?
I'm busy.

19:07.545 --> 19:09.501
Yes?

19:10.065 --> 19:12.784
- Watch out, kid.
- I'm not a kid, motherfucker!

19:13.025 --> 19:16.700
- Yo, man, chill.
- You better step on back, bitch!

19:22.105 --> 19:24.061
It's mine now.

19:24.305 --> 19:27.263
My boss will get his shit back!
You will pay, motherfucker!

19:27.505 --> 19:28.984
Come here.

19:29.425 --> 19:32.383
Your boss will get nothing back!
You hear me?

19:32.625 --> 19:34.581
I don't give a damn about your boss.

19:37.425 --> 19:39.302
Jojo's going to kill me.

19:39.745 --> 19:43.260
If I don't have his stuff,
he's going to beat me again.

19:44.105 --> 19:45.061
Please.

19:51.786 --> 19:54.619
I ain't giving you no cracks back,
little man.

19:56.946 --> 19:58.982
How much is this shit worth anyway?

19:59.586 --> 20:01.338
60 dollars.

20:06.746 --> 20:09.897
You lucky, little man.

20:15.226 --> 20:16.579
You do guns,

20:16.826 --> 20:18.942
you do drugs, it'll kill you.

20:19.666 --> 20:21.816
You hear what I'm saying? You will die!

20:23.026 --> 20:25.017
This game ain't designed for you to win.

20:28.746 --> 20:30.623
Get out of here, man.

20:36.826 --> 20:37.781
Shorty.

20:38.746 --> 20:42.102
- Do you know the stables on 37th and 11th?
- Yes.

20:43.146 --> 20:44.977
Come see me,

20:45.226 --> 20:47.979
if you want to talk,
have problems with your boss, whatever.

20:48.906 --> 20:51.864
I'll show you the horses and everything.
Just come see me.

20:52.346 --> 20:54.177
All right.

20:59.866 --> 21:01.504
I'm just trying to tell you

21:01.746 --> 21:04.101
that I got a long memory for this nigger.

21:05.826 --> 21:08.704
I loved your father, I love you.

21:09.546 --> 21:11.537
This is our neighborhood.

21:13.106 --> 21:16.064
If you need help,
if you need something happy,

21:18.946 --> 21:20.857
you don't have to say it.

21:22.586 --> 21:25.146
It will be done.

21:29.826 --> 21:32.579
- Come with me Monday night.
- Okay, right.

21:32.826 --> 21:35.863
- Okay.
- A-A bullshit.

21:36.106 --> 21:39.064
- I mean it, come with me or it's over.
- I heard you.

21:48.106 --> 21:50.062
You're a little tipsy, there.

21:50.306 --> 21:52.262
Where you running off to?

21:53.546 --> 21:56.618
I'm in a hurry.
I've been waiting a long time.

21:56.866 --> 21:58.822
- Yes?
- Yes.

22:01.746 --> 22:04.704
- What you been doing in there?
- I may have you a little something.

22:05.146 --> 22:06.101
What?

22:13.986 --> 22:16.978
- She's using you.
- I know, I'm just...

22:17.906 --> 22:20.818
She'll get her smack somewhere.
She might as well get it from me.

22:21.066 --> 22:23.102
She's your mother. I love you.

22:23.346 --> 22:25.143
So therefore, I love her.

22:25.586 --> 22:27.622
Fuck then, you got it under control.

22:30.026 --> 22:32.938
What about Johnny, Patty?
You gonna do what we talked about?

22:35.746 --> 22:36.701
Yes.

22:37.626 --> 22:40.538
I spent 5 years fighting on the inside,

22:41.146 --> 22:43.102
but it's done nothing for me here.

22:43.346 --> 22:45.382
I work hard and I train hard.

22:46.026 --> 22:47.778
I'm a good fighter.

22:48.026 --> 22:51.701
I won 53 fights in the joint.
I won 47 by knockout.

22:53.266 --> 22:55.063
I got the skills.

22:55.306 --> 22:57.615
If you decided that I wasn't right for you,

22:57.866 --> 22:59.822
I'll pull back with respect.

23:04.026 --> 23:07.223
You did time, but you came out
and made something of yourself.

23:07.466 --> 23:09.263
You became a champ again.

23:09.507 --> 23:11.782
I want the same, I know I got it in me too.

23:12.027 --> 23:14.587
I want to make something on myself.

23:15.267 --> 23:18.065
Look, I ain't in the hurt business no more.

23:19.267 --> 23:22.623
- We ain't that different...
- You and me got nothing in common.

23:22.867 --> 23:24.937
You understand that? Nothing.

23:29.467 --> 23:31.423
Yo, man.

23:32.027 --> 23:33.699
I saw the nigger

23:34.907 --> 23:36.863
strolling down 9th this morning.

23:37.827 --> 23:39.658
No respect, Patty,

23:40.107 --> 23:41.859
no respect.

23:42.187 --> 23:45.941
It was in your face, like that, man.

23:48.147 --> 23:50.103
I got to go check on Liz.

23:51.587 --> 23:53.623
She heard about Johnny getting out.

23:57.027 --> 23:59.905
- Listen, this thing with Johnny...
- What?

24:01.587 --> 24:03.578
What do you want me to do, forget?

24:04.547 --> 24:06.503
You saw what he did.

24:15.387 --> 24:17.343
It's not right that he gets to live.

24:22.667 --> 24:24.146
Come on.

24:24.867 --> 24:26.619
That's all you got?

24:34.267 --> 24:36.462
Come on, bitch, that's all you got?

24:40.587 --> 24:43.260
That's all you got? Prison bitch!

24:54.667 --> 24:56.703
Who's the bitch now, motherfucker?

25:15.787 --> 25:16.822
Lou?

25:19.427 --> 25:21.099
What's going on?

25:21.347 --> 25:24.020
Don't you wanna see what I got?
I smashed that bum.

25:24.267 --> 25:26.223
Ain't nothing I ain't seen before.

25:28.067 --> 25:30.023
What are you talking about?

25:32.347 --> 25:34.224
That kid, he's a punk.

25:34.827 --> 25:38.058
A hothead.
He drew you right into his game.

25:39.747 --> 25:42.545
- Are you a punk?
- No, I ain't no punk.

25:45.387 --> 25:47.457
I got to tell you, Johnny.

25:48.387 --> 25:50.264
God blessed you with good hands,

25:50.507 --> 25:52.463
speed, power.

25:53.587 --> 25:56.465
But in the humility department,
you're in the shitter.

25:56.907 --> 25:59.216
When you get caught up with bullshit,

25:59.467 --> 26:01.697
it'll bring you down.

26:02.147 --> 26:03.899
You know?

26:04.667 --> 26:06.464
I know what you mean.

26:06.707 --> 26:10.256
- This is your boy, Lou?
- He ain't nobody's boy.

26:11.787 --> 26:13.903
Why don't you give me a call sometime?

26:15.187 --> 26:17.701
Right around the corner, 125th and Third.

26:20.347 --> 26:23.259
I've been watching
how Gloria's been treating you, Patty.

26:24.587 --> 26:27.545
I don't think she's been
that nice to you lately.

26:32.907 --> 26:34.864
I don't want to talk about Gloria.

26:36.428 --> 26:38.623
She's going through some shit right now.

26:41.428 --> 26:43.259
She'll get over it.

26:45.668 --> 26:47.738
You she'll ever get over Johnny?

26:49.428 --> 26:51.942
Isn't that the shit she's going through?

26:55.508 --> 26:57.464
What the fuck are you trying to do?

26:57.708 --> 27:00.620
The fuck you saying?
It's your daughter you're talking about.

27:01.268 --> 27:02.223
Relax.

27:02.868 --> 27:04.824
I ain't trying to do nothing.

27:05.068 --> 27:07.024
Just trying to get to the truth.

27:10.028 --> 27:11.939
You like getting high?

27:13.828 --> 27:15.625
It's all right.

27:20.908 --> 27:22.785
You like me, Patty?

27:25.668 --> 27:28.136
What do you mean?

27:29.508 --> 27:30.941
I mean...

27:31.428 --> 27:33.305
..do you like me?

27:36.788 --> 27:38.585
Do you like me?

27:41.148 --> 27:42.103
Yes.

27:43.108 --> 27:44.780
I do.

27:49.268 --> 27:51.145
I really do.

27:54.028 --> 27:56.337
It don't matter which promoter you go with.

27:57.148 --> 27:59.981
They're all scum.
You don't trust them.

28:00.428 --> 28:02.623
You don't befriend them, you use them.

28:04.388 --> 28:06.982
But they could get us a title fight, right?

28:07.228 --> 28:10.220
They all promise the title
while they're raping your life.

28:11.428 --> 28:15.023
I know some fighters.
They got the belt, you know?

28:15.268 --> 28:16.223
Champions,

28:16.668 --> 28:19.819
living out here on the streets,
hustling, surviving.

28:20.548 --> 28:23.699
They beat
because they ain't nobody anymore.

28:24.908 --> 28:27.581
Spent all their money.
They ain't got nothing.

28:27.828 --> 28:29.705
You beat your brain out for the man.

28:30.828 --> 28:32.784
And he gets you up there.

28:33.268 --> 28:35.224
By the time you get there, you're fucked.

28:36.588 --> 28:38.579
Brain dead by the time you're 30.

28:39.868 --> 28:41.620
You get hit a lot,

28:42.108 --> 28:43.860
nothing matters.

28:45.028 --> 28:46.939
You listening me?

28:47.748 --> 28:51.661
- I hear you.
- No, I mean, the way I talk.

28:52.708 --> 28:54.824
You hear the way I talk?

28:56.988 --> 28:59.024
Ain't no glory to be where I am.

29:03.508 --> 29:06.420
Welcome to the world
of professional boxing.

29:36.828 --> 29:38.784
What's happening?

29:39.748 --> 29:41.704
Good to see you, kid.

29:43.828 --> 29:47.218
- Want a bite?
- No, thanks, we've already eaten.

29:51.188 --> 29:53.019
Care for a drink, Lou?

29:54.828 --> 29:56.580
No, thanks.

30:04.829 --> 30:06.945
5 years is a long time, ain't it, Johnny?

30:08.309 --> 30:09.708
No question.

30:10.149 --> 30:11.901
Smells good in here, don't it?

30:12.149 --> 30:15.698
Why don't we cut the small talk
and get down to business?

30:16.469 --> 30:18.744
You and me know what we're dealing with.

30:19.389 --> 30:22.142
The kid is bad, he ain't never been down.

30:22.789 --> 30:26.623
If we're going to do business,
you'll have to make this a sweet deal.

30:28.069 --> 30:30.025
That's real fucking good, Lou,

30:30.269 --> 30:32.339
if this kid was ranked, he ain't.

30:32.589 --> 30:34.819
How you doing? Get you anything else?

30:36.789 --> 30:38.461
No, I'm fine.

30:42.589 --> 30:44.341
As I was saying,

30:45.029 --> 30:46.781
sounds great.

30:47.669 --> 30:49.739
Too bad you ain't ranked, kid.

30:50.869 --> 30:54.145
Other than the money matters,
I wanted to talk about training.

30:55.829 --> 30:58.821
Now we do it my way,
in the city, at the stables.

30:59.069 --> 31:01.981
No training camps, no interference.

31:02.589 --> 31:04.545
We stay in Hell's Kitchen.

31:06.069 --> 31:08.902
I got the camp upstate.
I got the best trainers.

31:09.149 --> 31:12.107
- That's my deal, you know that.
- Can't do it.

31:17.949 --> 31:19.940
You're spending my money, Lou.

31:20.789 --> 31:24.782
We won't tell you how to promote.
Don't tell us how to fight.

31:28.389 --> 31:31.426
I'm sending Jimmy along
to make sure everything is on the up.

31:32.189 --> 31:35.659
Can't do it. No offense to Jimmy,
but that's a deal breaker.

31:39.269 --> 31:43.182
I'd like our training money in advance
so we can get started right away.

31:45.829 --> 31:47.979
You're a hard motherfucker, Lou.

31:51.309 --> 31:53.664
Come on, kid, let me show you the joint.

31:54.589 --> 31:56.466
Jimmy, take care of this.

31:59.349 --> 32:00.304
Thanks.

32:03.749 --> 32:05.705
Look, I got 14 of these places.

32:06.509 --> 32:08.545
Miami, L.A., Houston.

32:09.029 --> 32:10.701
Two in Boca Raton.

32:12.109 --> 32:15.306
I invest your money, you make money.

32:16.149 --> 32:18.026
Money makes money.

32:19.429 --> 32:21.465
That sounds good and everything,

32:22.069 --> 32:24.025
but it ain't happening without Lou.

32:25.029 --> 32:26.667
Relax, kid.

32:28.189 --> 32:30.987
I ain't here to talk
a whole lot of Hollywood bullshit.

32:31.429 --> 32:35.217
I ask questions. I cover my ass.
It's like a marriage.

32:40.109 --> 32:44.022
You're 164 pounds
of pure platinum futures, Johnny.

32:44.269 --> 32:46.225
There ain't no future without the key.

32:46.469 --> 32:49.302
I'm the one with the key,
know what I'm saying?

32:55.429 --> 32:57.181
Come here, lovey.

32:58.149 --> 33:00.060
Baby, how are you?

33:03.269 --> 33:05.100
You want this?

33:07.029 --> 33:08.701
You can have it.

33:11.629 --> 33:13.620
It's all part of the program.

33:15.549 --> 33:16.504
Pussy,

33:18.029 --> 33:19.860
cars, houses...

33:20.749 --> 33:24.663
Flying around on jets, banging
whoever you want, whenever you want.

33:30.270 --> 33:32.022
You deliver

33:32.830 --> 33:35.185
and I'll make your ass gold.

33:36.550 --> 33:38.506
You like gold, Johnny?

33:40.150 --> 33:42.789
Gold is nice.

33:48.830 --> 33:50.548
Talk to me.

33:51.390 --> 33:53.301
Nothing. It's me.

33:53.550 --> 33:56.986
I got to deal with reality.
And I got to stop taking from you.

33:58.750 --> 33:59.705
What?

34:01.230 --> 34:03.186
I got to take care of myself now.

34:12.830 --> 34:14.706
Why you talking like this?

34:26.750 --> 34:29.867
- Is this about Johnny?
- He killed my brother.

35:01.470 --> 35:04.268
Our Father who art in heaven,
hallowed be Thy name.

35:04.510 --> 35:08.423
Thy kingdom come. Thy will be done on Earth
as it is in heaven.

35:08.670 --> 35:10.626
But deliver us from evil.

35:14.430 --> 35:16.990
- What you doing?
- Get away, motherfucker.

35:17.230 --> 35:18.902
Calm down, stand up.

35:19.150 --> 35:21.106
That horse attacked me!

35:22.350 --> 35:25.308
- What happened to your eye?
- I heard what you said.

35:25.550 --> 35:27.586
I told Jojo I won't sell his shit anymore.

35:27.830 --> 35:30.822
He thought he could fuck me up,
but I'm hard.

35:31.070 --> 35:34.619
I'll get a piece and blow that nigger away.
That's what I'm going to do.

35:35.270 --> 35:39.183
I'm proud of you, you did the right thing.
But violence ain't always the answer, kid.

35:39.430 --> 35:41.990
- I told you I wasn't no kid.
- My bad.

35:42.630 --> 35:45.781
- What's your name, little man?
- Ricky. My name's Ricky.

35:46.030 --> 35:48.146
It's nice to meet you. My name's Johnny.

35:48.390 --> 35:50.028
Nice to meet you, Johnny.

35:52.270 --> 35:55.307
What am I sitting here for?
You got the piece or what?

35:58.870 --> 36:00.781
Let me do him for you, Gloria.

36:01.230 --> 36:03.380
Who? So I can owe you?

36:03.630 --> 36:06.588
Patty won't do it.
You asked him, right?

36:06.830 --> 36:08.866
Patty and I are none of your business.

36:10.110 --> 36:12.226
What am I gonna do?

36:14.070 --> 36:17.028
You know, if you were my old lady,
I'd take care of this

36:17.750 --> 36:19.741
without you ever even knowing.

36:20.590 --> 36:23.423
That nigger would've never
set foot in the Kitchen.

36:23.870 --> 36:26.430
He would gone bye-bye
on his way to the city.

36:26.670 --> 36:29.628
- Give me the gun, Sean.
- Know what I'm saying?

36:41.030 --> 36:43.703
- It's empty.
- In the glove box.

37:02.991 --> 37:03.980
Here.

37:07.831 --> 37:10.629
- What?
- I don't want your cash.

37:12.791 --> 37:14.588
Sean, what are you doing?

37:14.831 --> 37:17.061
You know what I feel about you.

37:17.711 --> 37:20.828
Come on. Is this a joke?
What are you fucking doing?

37:21.471 --> 37:24.508
- We could have everything.
- Get the fuck away from me.

37:24.751 --> 37:26.503
What are you doing?

37:27.351 --> 37:29.103
Whatever.

37:30.951 --> 37:32.782
Whatever.

37:36.271 --> 37:38.705
Here, go pay for some pussy.

37:40.511 --> 37:42.467
It's better we keep this between us.

37:44.151 --> 37:45.903
Nice girl.

37:46.151 --> 37:49.302
Like you don't want it!
Fucking bitch.

37:49.751 --> 37:52.311
He got cut by these cats on 49th, right?

37:53.191 --> 37:56.581
Got out of the hospital, then I see him
hanging around hustling that shit.

37:57.271 --> 37:59.944
Then he disappeared, 3 weeks later.

38:00.191 --> 38:02.466
He wasn't looking very good, either.

38:02.911 --> 38:06.381
Word up, B. Last time I seen that cat,
he was smoking crack,

38:06.631 --> 38:10.021
cleaning car windows, right over here.
Port Authority, B.

38:13.031 --> 38:15.784
- We're looking, baby.
- All right, man.

38:16.031 --> 38:18.784
One love man. If you see him, let me know.

38:19.031 --> 38:21.386
- All right, B.
- All right then.

38:24.551 --> 38:28.544
- You want to get something to eat?
- No doubt.

39:10.231 --> 39:13.143
- Where you live, little man?
- At home, sometimes.

39:13.391 --> 39:15.347
Some punk moved in with my mama.

39:15.591 --> 39:18.549
He don't like me, I don't fucking like him.

39:18.791 --> 39:20.827
Better I'm not around that much.

39:26.191 --> 39:28.944
You better slow down
before you choke yourself.

39:29.191 --> 39:31.989
I can eat more than a horse, I'm serious.

39:35.031 --> 39:36.987
Well, not one of them big horses.

39:48.591 --> 39:50.502
That's for you, man.

39:51.231 --> 39:53.062
No, man, that's all right.

39:53.711 --> 39:55.702
It's an advance, all right?

39:56.351 --> 39:58.262
You'll work in my corner.

39:58.511 --> 40:00.741
Lou will get you a job at the stables.

40:00.991 --> 40:03.585
- With the horses?
- That's right.

40:03.831 --> 40:06.220
That's your money, you understand that?

40:07.031 --> 40:10.023
Sure I do.
Nobody is going to take my money, Johnny.

40:10.471 --> 40:11.426
Thanks.

40:12.071 --> 40:15.030
I never got a break from nobody.
You the first one.

40:15.272 --> 40:16.944
I appreciate this.

40:17.912 --> 40:19.664
Ain't no thing, champ.

40:21.792 --> 40:25.068
It's getting kinda late,
you got somewhere to go?

40:26.392 --> 40:30.021
Sure, I got a place to go.
Thanks anyway.

40:30.872 --> 40:34.023
- You got somewhere to go?
- I'm fixed up real good.

40:35.032 --> 40:36.511
All right.

40:58.032 --> 40:59.704
Fuck off!

41:00.272 --> 41:02.069
Fuck you, fucker.

41:03.032 --> 41:04.988
Get the fuck off me.

41:06.792 --> 41:08.271
Fuck.

41:09.112 --> 41:11.706
- Jesus.
- All right.

41:29.032 --> 41:30.784
What's so funny?

41:59.272 --> 42:03.026
Pretty girl.
You look so beautiful.

42:07.032 --> 42:09.990
- Fuck you doing here, Jingo?
- Just chilling here, man.

42:12.152 --> 42:14.905
I want to know what the fuck
you're doing here.

42:15.152 --> 42:17.985
Relax, she invited me here.

42:18.232 --> 42:20.985
- What did I tell you?
- Not to come here.

42:21.232 --> 42:23.587
- No violence.
- What did I tell you?

42:23.832 --> 42:27.745
What did I say?
"If I see you again, I'll kill you".

42:28.832 --> 42:30.629
You hear me?

42:31.832 --> 42:32.787
Pants...

42:35.152 --> 42:36.107
Gloria...

42:41.712 --> 42:43.589
I fucked up.

42:49.032 --> 42:49.987
Mom?

42:52.032 --> 42:52.987
Mom.

43:35.152 --> 43:38.111
I see Hayden's eyes sometimes
when I look into yours.

43:41.033 --> 43:43.388
I wish he wasn't gone.

43:51.393 --> 43:53.384
He had the most beautiful smile.

44:00.153 --> 44:01.825
So do you.

44:02.553 --> 44:04.862
But I don't see it no more.

44:13.393 --> 44:15.349
You got to try to stop using, Mom.

44:28.153 --> 44:29.950
Come on.

44:42.033 --> 44:44.308
Babe, going to hang out for a while?

44:44.553 --> 44:46.544
Did you just score, Ma?

44:48.153 --> 44:50.109
You are such a little punk.

44:51.513 --> 44:53.390
You always accuse me of shit.

44:53.633 --> 44:56.352
I'm your mother,
I deserve a little respect.

45:15.593 --> 45:17.390
Gloria, don't run away from me.

45:18.353 --> 45:21.311
- You've gone soft.
- What the fuck you talking about?

45:22.193 --> 45:24.991
- You've gone soft, Patty.
- Don't you run away from me.

45:25.433 --> 45:27.230
Don't run...

45:28.753 --> 45:30.425
Fuck you!

45:38.033 --> 45:39.830
What the fuck you looking at?

45:41.073 --> 45:43.029
Just looking at you, Patty.

45:43.873 --> 45:45.943
Get you smart ass back to work, you bum.

45:58.233 --> 46:01.191
"Bulldozer" Prince
has everything to lose in this fight.

46:01.433 --> 46:03.230
He is the number one contender.

46:03.753 --> 46:05.584
Johnny "Tombstone" Miles,

46:05.833 --> 46:08.552
somehow working his way into this fight.

46:09.233 --> 46:12.430
He had been ranked
in the lower echelon of the top ten.

46:13.153 --> 46:16.145
Crafty management has gotten him
this vital bout.

46:16.393 --> 46:18.349
He's trying to take advantage of it

46:18.593 --> 46:21.471
to maneuver his way into a title fight.

46:21.713 --> 46:24.671
They continue to exchange punches
in a lively first round.

46:26.113 --> 46:29.185
Prince against the ropes.
Miles trying to take advantage.

46:29.633 --> 46:33.546
Miles with a good right hand,
and back goes Prince on his heels.

46:35.833 --> 46:38.745
He's shaken up and tries to recover.
He moves to the center of the ring.

46:38.993 --> 46:42.542
- Good first round.
- Come on, there you go.

46:43.553 --> 46:45.509
Good combination there by Miles.

46:45.753 --> 46:48.825
Miles trying to get the advantage
and he has the lead in this round.

46:49.073 --> 46:50.267
An uppercut,

46:51.033 --> 46:52.989
and Prince, once again...

48:52.074 --> 48:55.111
It's a tough way to get a shot.
But it is what it is.

48:56.154 --> 48:58.110
This ain't the time for this.

49:00.274 --> 49:02.230
I got a call from the commissioner.

49:03.074 --> 49:05.065
You're ranked number one, kid.

49:05.314 --> 49:07.305
We're one fight away from payday.

49:08.474 --> 49:10.430
All we got to do is put it together.

49:11.074 --> 49:14.908
I just put a man on his deathbed.
And you talk about "put it together"?

49:15.154 --> 49:17.907
- Get the fuck out of my face!
- Relax!

49:34.834 --> 49:35.789
Thanks.

49:41.674 --> 49:44.711
The kid had a blood clot on the brain.

49:45.994 --> 49:47.950
Neurosurgeon removed it.

49:48.194 --> 49:51.709
He's critical, but he's stable.

49:53.114 --> 49:54.866
Luck of the Irish, kid.

49:55.354 --> 49:57.310
You got a clear conscience.

49:58.874 --> 50:01.183
I'll catch you tomorrow.

50:02.674 --> 50:05.472
Anything the kids wants, give it to him.

50:07.594 --> 50:08.549
Anything.

50:19.914 --> 50:21.791
He ain't going to fight again.

50:22.034 --> 50:24.628
- I don't...
- Listen to me.

50:26.155 --> 50:29.067
Listen to me, it ain't your fault.

50:30.515 --> 50:32.585
This thing could've gone the other way.

50:33.795 --> 50:35.751
Johnny, it ain't your fault.

50:38.195 --> 50:40.186
Ain't your fault.

50:52.308 --> 50:54.868
- What's up?
- You're a good man.

50:55.108 --> 50:57.827
God knows you didn't mean
to hurt that fighter tonight.

50:58.828 --> 51:00.705
Thanks a lot, little man.

51:00.948 --> 51:03.860
I'm going to take a shower.
Go in there with Lou, I'll be out soon.

51:04.108 --> 51:05.461
All right.

51:15.308 --> 51:17.219
What are you doing?

51:20.228 --> 51:23.061
Hayden was the only good thing in my life.

51:24.268 --> 51:27.305
Put down the gun.
You don't know what you're doing.

51:32.628 --> 51:34.459
Come on, put it down.

51:37.428 --> 51:39.020
Put it down.

51:51.388 --> 51:52.343
He...

51:53.628 --> 51:55.664
Come here.

51:57.868 --> 51:59.824
I loved Hayden too.

52:09.228 --> 52:11.184
He was like a brother to me.

53:02.888 --> 53:04.526
They're in the back.

53:41.728 --> 53:43.684
Can I get a fucking drink?

53:45.968 --> 53:47.924
Did you just fucked my mother?

53:54.929 --> 53:58.126
- You're a fucking whore.
- Don't overreact.

54:03.409 --> 54:05.604
- Gloria...
- Get the fuck...

54:05.849 --> 54:08.807
Why'd you fuck her?
It's not good enough to fuck me?

54:25.329 --> 54:27.206
God, I fucking love you.

54:31.169 --> 54:34.400
Come on, baby.
Does that hurt?

54:37.609 --> 54:40.760
This is what you're good at.
You're made for this.

54:41.729 --> 54:43.799
This is all you can do, what about me?

54:57.809 --> 54:59.765
Don't you want me, Patty?

55:00.009 --> 55:01.488
Want me?

55:06.089 --> 55:09.638
You think we're gonna fuck?
After you fucked my mother?

55:10.489 --> 55:13.208
You think I'm ever going to fuck you?

55:48.409 --> 55:49.364
Sorry!

56:30.969 --> 56:31.924
Gloria?

56:35.769 --> 56:37.521
Will you speak with me?

56:39.409 --> 56:42.446
- I need to talk to you.
- I don't want to talk to you.

56:44.289 --> 56:46.245
I need to talk to you!

56:48.249 --> 56:50.240
I got nothing to say to you anymore.

56:53.849 --> 56:55.805
I have no excuse for the other night.

56:57.169 --> 56:58.966
I love you so much.

57:00.809 --> 57:02.527
I'm really sorry.

57:03.769 --> 57:06.681
Sorry don't mean nothing to me.
You fucked my mother.

57:09.969 --> 57:11.925
I killed Hayden!

57:15.089 --> 57:16.967
I killed Hayden!

57:17.450 --> 57:19.281
I killed Hayden!

57:20.170 --> 57:22.047
It was me!

57:25.770 --> 57:27.647
What are you talking about?

57:37.610 --> 57:40.522
- Patty, what did you just say?
- I killed Hayden.

57:41.170 --> 57:43.126
I didn't mean to, it was an accident.

57:44.010 --> 57:45.841
I swear to God.

57:47.130 --> 57:49.405
Fucking gook started shooting.

57:49.970 --> 57:53.007
It got off and things went crazy,
he shot Johnny

57:53.250 --> 57:55.127
and I turned...

57:56.450 --> 57:58.406
Are you fucking lying to me?

57:59.130 --> 58:02.167
You fucking lying to me?
You've been fucking me!

58:02.410 --> 58:04.162
You've been fucking me!

58:04.410 --> 58:06.446
And you've been fucking living with me.

58:09.610 --> 58:11.566
I'm sorry.

58:11.810 --> 58:14.688
I was afraid, I didn't want...
I was afraid I'd lose you.

58:14.930 --> 58:16.886
You know how much he meant.

58:17.130 --> 58:19.883
You know what I've been going through.

58:20.130 --> 58:23.645
You know what I've been going through
and you fucking knew?

58:26.850 --> 58:29.080
Why did you lie to me?

58:29.530 --> 58:31.566
I didn't want to lose you.

58:31.810 --> 58:35.644
Every day I fucking wanted to tell you.
I wanted to tell you every day.

58:35.890 --> 58:39.246
Every day when you look at me
you were sad and I see you upset,

58:39.490 --> 58:41.845
then it's like
I couldn't do anything about it.

58:42.090 --> 58:43.967
Only thing I could do is tell you
and then lose you.

58:44.210 --> 58:47.043
It's fucking selfish, I'm fucked up
and I'm really sorry.

58:47.290 --> 58:51.078
I'm fucking going crazy, see?
I'm not working right.

58:53.090 --> 58:54.045
Shit!

58:54.290 --> 58:56.167
I'm sorry, I love you.

58:57.770 --> 58:59.726
You keep me sane.

58:59.970 --> 59:02.530
I want you to marry me.

59:03.850 --> 59:05.806
Will you please marry me?

59:08.170 --> 59:10.365
I can't.

59:11.410 --> 59:13.446
I want to be alone for a while.

59:13.690 --> 59:15.885
I want to be alone.

59:21.890 --> 59:23.881
I need your love, Gloria!

59:25.090 --> 59:26.887
I need you!

59:44.610 --> 59:46.441
I need you!

59:47.210 --> 59:50.168
I fucking love you so much!
I'm sorry!

01:00:12.250 --> 01:00:14.445
How you doing? You okay?

01:00:15.210 --> 01:00:16.165
Better.

01:00:17.170 --> 01:00:18.125
Good.

01:00:19.570 --> 01:00:21.526
- Let's go.
- Right.

01:00:52.411 --> 01:00:54.367
Have you been looking for Stevey?

01:00:56.611 --> 01:00:57.566
Yes.

01:00:58.531 --> 01:01:00.487
Nobody's seen him.

01:01:00.731 --> 01:01:03.484
I tried to help him, you know?
I tried to talk to him.

01:01:05.131 --> 01:01:07.122
He didn't want to talk to me.

01:01:07.731 --> 01:01:09.562
I don't blame you.

01:01:14.771 --> 01:01:16.568
Sorry about Hayden.

01:01:21.691 --> 01:01:23.647
I'm sorry I brought him to a robbery.

01:01:23.891 --> 01:01:25.847
I'm sorry we did a fucking robbery.

01:01:26.491 --> 01:01:29.449
It was stupid.
Stupid, you know.

01:01:31.411 --> 01:01:33.481
You paid a big price for all of us,

01:01:33.731 --> 01:01:35.483
five years.

01:01:36.931 --> 01:01:39.126
I did time for something I was part of.

01:01:40.091 --> 01:01:42.047
No more, no less.

01:02:48.771 --> 01:02:50.682
Want me to fucking choke you?

01:02:51.331 --> 01:02:54.687
Come here, you fucking punk.
You fucking punk.

01:03:05.731 --> 01:03:09.519
You are not holy, got it?
You are not fucking holy!

01:03:24.771 --> 01:03:27.331
Come here, you fuck, suck my tit.

01:03:28.171 --> 01:03:29.763
Suck it.

01:03:30.011 --> 01:03:32.320
Come on, you fuck.

01:03:32.571 --> 01:03:34.687
Come on you fucking punk.

01:03:46.371 --> 01:03:48.521
Be glad I fucked him.

01:03:50.731 --> 01:03:52.642
Be glad I fucked him.

01:03:53.411 --> 01:03:55.288
Liz, what are you talking about?

01:03:59.651 --> 01:04:01.369
You're lucky.

01:04:09.412 --> 01:04:12.131
- Where are you going?
- What do you care, Mom?

01:04:12.572 --> 01:04:15.644
- What do you mean, "What do I care?"
- Mom, just...

01:04:16.492 --> 01:04:17.641
Listen...

01:04:20.212 --> 01:04:22.043
I know I fucked up, so...

01:04:23.852 --> 01:04:26.525
You really should be glad
that I fucked him,

01:04:26.772 --> 01:04:30.526
because I wish somebody had saved me
from the misery of being with your old man.

01:04:31.932 --> 01:04:33.763
Don't talk to me.

01:04:36.092 --> 01:04:38.083
Gloria, honey.

01:04:46.772 --> 01:04:49.730
- You're not going anywhere.
- Shut the fuck up.

01:04:49.972 --> 01:04:53.851
You're too busy banging that nigger
to fucking return my calls or what?

01:04:54.092 --> 01:04:57.448
- What's the matter?
- Where do you think you're going?

01:04:57.692 --> 01:04:59.762
Look at me.

01:05:00.212 --> 01:05:02.567
What is that? I'm losing it here.

01:05:02.812 --> 01:05:05.167
I love you so much.

01:05:05.972 --> 01:05:08.566
Fuck you, it's me you fucked!

01:05:08.812 --> 01:05:11.645
Stay away from my daughter, you fuck!

01:05:15.132 --> 01:05:16.042
Gloria!

01:05:16.292 --> 01:05:19.284
- Listen to me. Don't you go.
- Don't you fucking hit me.

01:05:20.092 --> 01:05:21.889
Don't you go!

01:05:22.132 --> 01:05:25.329
Listen, stay out of my life.
You stay out of my fucking life!

01:05:33.612 --> 01:05:35.364
See, Gloria...

01:05:43.132 --> 01:05:46.488
I didn't mean to hit you.
I'm sorry, I didn't mean to hit you.

01:05:47.172 --> 01:05:50.323
- I need you to listen to me.
- I don't want you now!

01:05:50.572 --> 01:05:52.688
Turn around and listen to me.

01:05:57.732 --> 01:05:59.484
You don't love me?

01:05:59.732 --> 01:06:01.768
You don't love me after 5 years?

01:06:02.612 --> 01:06:04.170
After 5 years?

01:06:04.412 --> 01:06:08.087
- You lived with me...
- You killed my brother, you motherfucker!

01:06:08.332 --> 01:06:10.288
You think I'm gonna touch you again?

01:06:10.532 --> 01:06:14.445
You think I'm gonna fucking
touch you again?

01:06:15.052 --> 01:06:16.929
Let me go.

01:06:17.172 --> 01:06:19.163
Fuck you both.

01:06:21.012 --> 01:06:21.967
Gloria!

01:06:23.932 --> 01:06:25.285
Gloria!

01:06:28.692 --> 01:06:30.171
Gloria!

01:07:03.452 --> 01:07:06.922
Don't you ever, ever fucking
touch her again, you hear me?

01:07:35.533 --> 01:07:37.410
Don't fucking do it, Sean.

01:07:38.093 --> 01:07:40.049
Sean, don't fucking do it!

01:07:40.813 --> 01:07:43.327
It's time, Patty, it's time.

01:08:09.653 --> 01:08:12.121
Shoot that fucking nigger!

01:08:23.372 --> 01:08:24.362
Patty!

01:08:36.733 --> 01:08:38.689
How they get here, Johnny?

01:08:38.933 --> 01:08:41.401
The coroner stores them for 2 weeks.

01:08:41.653 --> 01:08:45.089
If nobody claims them, they're tagged
and sent up to Potter's Field.

01:08:47.493 --> 01:08:49.370
These are the people you used to bury?

01:08:52.813 --> 01:08:55.042
Yes but, I never saw their faces.

01:08:55.292 --> 01:08:57.249
They were all just numbers to me up there.

01:09:02.973 --> 01:09:03.928
Johnny.

01:09:04.453 --> 01:09:06.408
Here go one ofJojo's boy.

01:09:06.653 --> 01:09:09.406
He just a little country chicken
from North Carolina.

01:09:09.853 --> 01:09:12.925
Damn, he ain't never hurt nobody.

01:09:47.813 --> 01:09:49.769
I guess I found my brother.

01:09:56.613 --> 01:09:59.411
Don't drive away! Go get Johnny!

01:09:59.973 --> 01:10:01.929
Don't go, get Johnny right now!

01:10:15.613 --> 01:10:17.365
How's going, champ?

01:10:20.133 --> 01:10:23.648
What's this bullshit I hear
about the kid not fighting Hines?

01:10:25.333 --> 01:10:27.369
What is this, some kind of fucking joke?

01:10:28.693 --> 01:10:32.481
The kid's going through
a difficult period right now.

01:10:33.733 --> 01:10:35.803
He'll be all right, give him little time.

01:10:36.253 --> 01:10:37.208
Time?

01:10:37.893 --> 01:10:40.487
What the fuck are you talking about "time"?

01:10:42.573 --> 01:10:44.723
I think we'd better take a little walk.

01:10:47.133 --> 01:10:49.089
Let me tell you something.

01:10:49.773 --> 01:10:51.923
I got a lot of money invested in this kid.

01:10:52.173 --> 01:10:55.325
I don't want to hear any bullshit
about this "difficult" time.

01:10:57.654 --> 01:11:00.612
I want him to do what I say, when I say.

01:11:02.814 --> 01:11:06.250
What the fuck do I got,
some nigger prima donna on my hands?

01:11:11.214 --> 01:11:12.169
Lou?

01:11:13.934 --> 01:11:16.573
This kid ain't no angel, we both know that.

01:11:20.374 --> 01:11:22.604
I heard about his trouble the other night.

01:11:26.174 --> 01:11:28.130
Without me backing him,

01:11:29.854 --> 01:11:33.005
he's just another jungle bunny with a gun.

01:11:35.734 --> 01:11:37.804
Get in his hear, Lou.

01:11:39.854 --> 01:11:41.890
You make him think right.

01:11:47.294 --> 01:11:48.966
He goes down.

01:11:54.014 --> 01:11:55.367
By the way...

01:11:56.254 --> 01:11:58.529
..I got some sweet odds on the kid.

01:12:00.174 --> 01:12:01.971
Know what I'm saying, Lou?

01:12:04.134 --> 01:12:06.090
I can't pass them up.

01:12:07.774 --> 01:12:09.810
He's a good kid.

01:12:12.774 --> 01:12:14.685
I know you like him, Lou.

01:12:16.414 --> 01:12:19.053
That's why I want you to explain to him

01:12:21.414 --> 01:12:23.132
that he fights,

01:12:23.974 --> 01:12:27.569
or I'll send his black fucking ass
back to prison.

01:12:30.734 --> 01:12:32.850
And if he can't get down with that...

01:12:36.414 --> 01:12:38.166
..I'll kill him.

01:13:30.934 --> 01:13:34.847
Bob Papa along with Sal Marciano.
The grudge match is finally here.

01:13:35.094 --> 01:13:38.564
Bobby "The Razor" Hines, undefeated,
defends his super middleweight championship

01:13:38.814 --> 01:13:40.770
against Johnny "Tombstone" Miles.

01:13:41.014 --> 01:13:42.970
You wonder about Miles' state of mind.

01:13:43.214 --> 01:13:45.170
At the weigh in, Hines said:

01:13:45.574 --> 01:13:48.293
"I'm sorry to hear
about your dead brother".

01:13:48.534 --> 01:13:50.490
This infuriated the challenger.

01:13:50.734 --> 01:13:52.929
He threw a punch and knocked down Hines.

01:13:53.374 --> 01:13:56.207
Hines had never been knocked down
in a fight before.

01:13:56.694 --> 01:13:58.571
What about Miles?
He is clearly the underdog.

01:13:59.974 --> 01:14:02.932
You wonder about his state of mind
as we approach the opening bell.

01:14:03.414 --> 01:14:06.167
The champion feeling out Miles
in round one.

01:14:09.814 --> 01:14:11.645
Pretty brisk pace, to start.

01:14:11.894 --> 01:14:14.692
At this pace, we're gonna have
problem with fatigue later.

01:14:14.934 --> 01:14:18.371
You'd think they would be more strategic,
but they're going at each other.

01:14:18.935 --> 01:14:22.484
- Miles working the body.
- He follows up with a good jab.

01:14:22.735 --> 01:14:25.647
Good round one for
Johnny "Tombstone" Miles.

01:14:26.295 --> 01:14:30.208
Final seconds of round two.
This ain't no disco.

01:14:30.455 --> 01:14:32.889
Miles has really come on in this round.

01:14:33.335 --> 01:14:35.974
Good body work by the challenger,
"The Tombstone".

01:14:36.215 --> 01:14:38.888
A big left hand by Hines and Miles is down.

01:14:40.415 --> 01:14:43.168
- You all right Johnny? Get up, man.
- Use your head!

01:14:44.975 --> 01:14:47.330
..and he's up, he beat the count.

01:14:48.255 --> 01:14:51.884
Miles finishes the round with a right hand!
What a furious pace!

01:15:30.615 --> 01:15:32.651
Johnny seems composed in his corner.

01:15:32.895 --> 01:15:35.614
Hines continues to have that smug look.

01:15:35.855 --> 01:15:37.811
There's no love lost.

01:15:38.055 --> 01:15:40.011
The grudge match getting ready for round 5.

01:15:40.255 --> 01:15:42.769
You sense it swaying in the favor of Miles.

01:15:43.975 --> 01:15:45.693
Down goes Hines!

01:15:45.935 --> 01:15:48.893
The first time in his career
the champion has been down!

01:15:49.135 --> 01:15:51.968
A 3 punch combination, a double left
then a right to the head.

01:15:52.215 --> 01:15:54.046
The referee's counting.

01:17:18.495 --> 01:17:20.884
A right hand and down goes Hines!

01:17:21.535 --> 01:17:24.766
Hines on his back! The champion
is on his back, unbelievable.

01:17:25.215 --> 01:17:28.013
Miles in a neutral corner,
the referee moving in.

01:17:28.255 --> 01:17:29.927
The count now is 6,

01:17:30.175 --> 01:17:31.574
7, 8.

01:17:31.815 --> 01:17:33.771
Can he get up? He's not going to get up!

01:17:34.015 --> 01:17:36.575
10! Goodnight sweet prince,
we have a new champion.

01:17:36.815 --> 01:17:39.613
The new super middleweight
champion of the world,

01:17:39.855 --> 01:17:41.811
say it, is Johnny "The Tombstone" Miles.

01:17:46.776 --> 01:17:50.530
Don't you listen, fucker?
I'll fucking kill you!

01:17:51.816 --> 01:17:52.771
Cocksucker!

01:17:56.256 --> 01:17:59.054
You fucked me out of my money,
you motherfucker.

01:17:59.296 --> 01:18:01.252
I don't give a fuck about your money.

01:18:01.856 --> 01:18:04.768
Ain't gonna let you do to him
what you did to me.

01:18:05.936 --> 01:18:08.370
I'll fucking kill you, I'll kill you.

01:18:32.496 --> 01:18:33.451
Lou?

01:18:45.656 --> 01:18:47.408
It's all right.

01:18:48.656 --> 01:18:50.647
Get him the fuck out of my stable.

01:18:58.696 --> 01:19:00.448
I've been using since

01:19:00.696 --> 01:19:02.652
I was in a stage accident.

01:19:03.296 --> 01:19:05.412
That's when I got hooked on dope.

01:19:05.936 --> 01:19:08.052
Because it took the pain away

01:19:08.296 --> 01:19:10.651
and make me not think about

01:19:11.696 --> 01:19:13.812
how fucked up it is to be a cripple.

01:19:19.736 --> 01:19:21.692
Still is fucked up,

01:19:26.976 --> 01:19:30.013
but it caused more pain
than it was taking away,

01:19:31.376 --> 01:19:33.367
because of all people around me,

01:19:34.336 --> 01:19:36.406
I love and love me...

01:19:39.576 --> 01:19:41.373
My daughter, Gloria,

01:19:42.976 --> 01:19:44.932
I don't even know where she is.

01:19:45.176 --> 01:19:47.132
She don't speak me anymore.

01:19:53.296 --> 01:19:55.093
I lost my son.

01:19:58.296 --> 01:20:01.288
He was 15 years old, his name was Hayden.

01:20:03.536 --> 01:20:05.731
He got killed trying to rob someone.

01:20:08.096 --> 01:20:10.132
He was a beautiful boy.

01:20:13.376 --> 01:20:15.094
I'm a singer.

01:20:15.616 --> 01:20:17.288
I sing.

01:20:18.896 --> 01:20:22.332
I don't know if I'm really good at it,

01:20:24.736 --> 01:20:26.488
but it's something

01:20:26.976 --> 01:20:29.695
that comes from inside.

01:20:29.936 --> 01:20:31.892
It's natural, it's something

01:20:32.536 --> 01:20:34.652
that I must do.

01:20:38.496 --> 01:20:40.327
It's part of who I am.

01:20:43.976 --> 01:20:46.092
And I have to do it sober now.

01:20:48.136 --> 01:20:50.730
So, I want to thank you all

01:20:51.936 --> 01:20:53.927
for listening me.

01:20:54.376 --> 01:20:58.289
And I want to thank God
for keeping me sober today.

01:20:59.616 --> 01:21:00.571
Thanks.

01:22:44.337 --> 01:22:47.329
- I got something I got to tell you.
- Shoot.

01:23:03.097 --> 01:23:04.974
I'm pregnant, Johnny.

01:23:07.417 --> 01:23:09.328
I took the test 3 days ago.

01:23:21.537 --> 01:23:23.493
I feel alive again.

01:23:24.257 --> 01:23:26.248
I know it sounds stupid,

01:23:26.777 --> 01:23:29.655
but I don't want to lose this baby.
I don't want to give it up.

01:23:31.857 --> 01:23:33.529
I'm telling you because,

01:23:34.617 --> 01:23:35.891
you know.

01:23:36.137 --> 01:23:38.093
But you don't have to be the father.

01:23:38.337 --> 01:23:41.727
I don't expect your life to change.
I don't need anything from you.

01:23:41.977 --> 01:23:42.932
Gloria?

01:23:44.097 --> 01:23:46.975
Johnny, I want to keep the baby.
I really want to keep the baby.

01:23:47.217 --> 01:23:48.172
Gloria.

01:23:48.857 --> 01:23:50.813
I don't want you to have an abortion.

01:23:53.217 --> 01:23:54.172
Okay?

01:23:55.097 --> 01:23:56.974
I want this baby.

01:23:58.137 --> 01:24:00.014
I want you.

01:24:13.417 --> 01:24:15.373
Excuse me, Miss McNeary.

01:24:16.657 --> 01:24:18.488
My name is Lou Reilly.

01:24:20.617 --> 01:24:22.369
Do I know you?

01:24:23.177 --> 01:24:26.408
No, you don't know me.
I'm a friend ofJohnny Miles.

01:24:28.857 --> 01:24:30.813
I don't mean to bother you or nothing.

01:24:31.657 --> 01:24:34.616
But I been listening to you talk
for the past month or so.

01:24:34.858 --> 01:24:38.771
I was thinking maybe I could help you out
with the situation with Gloria.

01:24:40.338 --> 01:24:41.293
Gloria?

01:24:43.658 --> 01:24:47.367
What is it you know
about my daughter and I, what is it?

01:24:48.938 --> 01:24:50.735
She's been living with Johnny

01:24:50.978 --> 01:24:54.891
over at the stables that I work at,
over on 37th Street.

01:24:56.618 --> 01:24:59.610
I just wanted to invite you down.

01:24:59.858 --> 01:25:02.531
Come down and maybe talk to her.

01:25:02.778 --> 01:25:04.689
I don't think it would hurt.

01:25:06.698 --> 01:25:09.656
So that's where she's been living
all these months.

01:25:11.298 --> 01:25:13.175
She's pregnant.

01:25:13.418 --> 01:25:16.330
They're going to be married,
did you know that?

01:25:18.098 --> 01:25:20.931
No, I didn't know that.

01:25:24.938 --> 01:25:26.894
Anyway, here's the address.

01:25:27.138 --> 01:25:29.857
I just wanted you to know
you're invited down anytime.

01:25:30.498 --> 01:25:32.295
Anytime you want.

01:25:34.058 --> 01:25:35.013
Thanks...

01:25:37.098 --> 01:25:40.010
..but I don't know
whether I can come or not.

01:25:42.898 --> 01:25:45.890
Look, I appreciate what you did, it's nice.

01:25:48.978 --> 01:25:50.650
I got to go.

01:25:50.898 --> 01:25:53.935
- It was very nice meeting you.
- Same here.

01:26:04.378 --> 01:26:05.333
Johnny.

01:26:11.458 --> 01:26:13.414
You don't want to hurt anybody.

01:26:18.738 --> 01:26:22.413
I ain't going to hurt nobody no more.

01:26:23.698 --> 01:26:26.451
- Don't fucking do it.
- This is what you wanted, right?

01:26:26.698 --> 01:26:29.735
- This is what you wanted.
- It's not what I wanted, it's not!

01:26:30.778 --> 01:26:32.928
Get the fuck off me!

01:26:34.858 --> 01:26:36.814
- Johnny?
- What the fuck?

01:26:37.698 --> 01:26:38.653
No.

01:26:40.698 --> 01:26:41.653
Ricky!

01:26:43.058 --> 01:26:45.014
You going to be all right.

01:26:45.578 --> 01:26:47.569
Get an ambulance, hurry up!

01:26:51.618 --> 01:26:53.688
You'll be all right.

01:26:53.938 --> 01:26:55.769
Fuck.

01:26:57.218 --> 01:26:59.527
What the fuck did you just do?

01:27:03.698 --> 01:27:05.928
You're all right, you're doing all right.

01:27:07.018 --> 01:27:09.134
- Help.
- Just hang in there.

01:27:09.778 --> 01:27:11.734
What the fuck did you just do?

01:27:13.778 --> 01:27:15.530
You'll be all right.

01:27:19.978 --> 01:27:22.094
It's gonna be all right.

01:28:55.899 --> 01:28:59.687
I know I'm not welcome here, I'll just say
what I gotta say and then leave.

01:29:03.859 --> 01:29:05.895
I'm happy for both of yous.

01:29:07.699 --> 01:29:10.532
You'll have a beautiful baby.

01:29:16.139 --> 01:29:18.050
I've been straight now for 3 months.

01:29:19.979 --> 01:29:22.812
I got a job... in retail.

01:29:30.339 --> 01:29:32.614
These are poems Patty wrote for you.

01:29:35.339 --> 01:29:37.534
This one's for you.

01:29:40.579 --> 01:29:42.535
They got him locked in the nuthouse.

01:29:45.299 --> 01:29:47.369
I went in there and I looked in on him.

01:29:48.499 --> 01:29:50.091
He's not good.

01:29:50.339 --> 01:29:52.295
He talked a couple times.

01:29:52.979 --> 01:29:55.857
He told me his father
used to beat him real bad.

01:29:57.739 --> 01:29:59.695
I don't know if he'll pull through.

01:30:02.219 --> 01:30:05.928
He's not talking now.
Not to the doctors, nobody.

01:30:08.379 --> 01:30:10.335
He's just sitting there.

01:30:16.019 --> 01:30:17.896
I'm sorry, honey.

01:30:18.579 --> 01:30:20.570
I'm sorry for all I did to you.

01:31:13.419 --> 01:31:15.410
I read the poems you wrote me, Patty.

01:31:17.259 --> 01:31:19.215
What can I say?

01:31:20.099 --> 01:31:21.818
They're beautiful.

01:31:24.180 --> 01:31:27.138
Your words, they just shine off the paper.

01:31:29.100 --> 01:31:31.136
It's like I can feel your essence.

01:31:31.580 --> 01:31:34.299
It's like I can feel the real you.

01:31:38.020 --> 01:31:39.976
I didn't know about the beatings.

01:31:41.980 --> 01:31:44.130
I didn't know your pop did that to you.

01:31:45.420 --> 01:31:48.378
I swear to God, Patty,
I didn't know shit back then.

01:31:50.940 --> 01:31:52.737
You can talk to me.

01:31:53.780 --> 01:31:55.532
I'm here for you.

01:31:57.340 --> 01:32:00.093
Is the kid okay? Is he all right?

01:32:01.980 --> 01:32:03.777
He's okay.

01:32:04.300 --> 01:32:05.938
He's here.

01:32:06.700 --> 01:32:08.531
- Really?
- Yes.

01:32:13.060 --> 01:32:15.051
I didn't know what I was doing.

01:32:16.780 --> 01:32:19.533
I didn't meant to hurt...
I would never hurt you, Johnny.

01:32:19.780 --> 01:32:22.738
- I never want to hurt anybody.
- I know, man.

01:32:22.980 --> 01:32:24.936
I never want to hurt nobody.

01:32:30.260 --> 01:32:32.216
I didn't mean to shoot Hayden.

01:32:32.740 --> 01:32:35.652
- I didn't mean to shoot him.
- I know it.

01:32:36.500 --> 01:32:39.378
We all had a tough life.
All of us.

01:32:40.420 --> 01:32:42.411
It wasn't your fault Hayden died.

01:32:42.980 --> 01:32:46.097
We were kids.
We all took the same stupid chance.

01:32:47.460 --> 01:32:48.973
Now,

01:32:49.940 --> 01:32:52.852
we have to take Hayden and Stevey spirit.

01:32:53.100 --> 01:32:55.056
And we have to keep living.

01:32:55.980 --> 01:32:59.529
We can't stop.
It won't be the same without you, brother.

01:33:01.340 --> 01:33:02.932
I love you.

01:33:03.500 --> 01:33:05.297
Come here, man.
