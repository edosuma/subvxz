Him.

40:57.080 --> 40:58.820
Who the hell are you?

40:59.040 --> 41:02.908
I'm the guy who's taking you back to DC.
to admit you framed my wife for murder.

Here's how it'll go. I'll take Tiny Tim
out first because he's the biggest.

41:11.970 --> 41:13.710
Then Russian guy goes for his gun.

41:13.888 --> 41:15.844
I'm betting he shoots one of you, not me.

41:16.015 --> 41:20.509
Volkens is already pissing his pants,
so I don't think he's gonna be a problem.

41:20.687 --> 41:22.518
And that would leave....

41:23.648 --> 41:24.683
...me and you...

41:26.651 --> 41:28.107
...Karakurt.

41:35.827 --> 41:38.113
-Don't kill me.
-Not yet.
