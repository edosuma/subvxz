WEBVTT

00:01.164 --> 00:02.694
Whoa, whoa, whoa, we're live.

00:02.719 --> 00:04.019
Naima?

00:04.043 --> 00:05.320
22-year-old male,

00:05.345 --> 00:07.250
gunshot wound to the abdomen. GCS 15.

00:07.275 --> 00:09.296
- Dr. Choi, GSW!
- On it!

00:09.321 --> 00:11.104
- BP, 100 over 50.
- Oh, wait a second.

00:11.129 --> 00:12.539
Wait a sec. Whoa.

00:12.564 --> 00:14.580
- Get this one up to surgery.
- All right, let's go.

00:14.605 --> 00:16.853
- [groaning, coughing]
- Okay, here we go.

00:17.160 --> 00:19.227
- Dr. Choi, you're good?
- Good.

00:19.252 --> 00:21.519
All right, Monique...

00:21.741 --> 00:23.931
Seven treatment rooms on the East side,

00:23.956 --> 00:25.823
four trauma bays on the West.

00:25.848 --> 00:28.749
Bays three and four combine
to treat gunshot wounds,

00:28.774 --> 00:31.741
a place affectionately known as Baghdad.

00:32.072 --> 00:33.908
4,000 shootings in Chicago.

00:33.933 --> 00:35.610
- Some days, we get...
- [yells]

00:35.635 --> 00:36.634
A dozen.

00:36.659 --> 00:39.008
[yelling]

00:39.600 --> 00:43.392
Drug dispensers are in the
North and South end of the E.D,

00:43.417 --> 00:46.947
extra gurneys,
isolations suites in the ambulance bay.

00:46.972 --> 00:50.643
Uh, Band-Aid, wound dressings,
gauze, and extra weaponry

00:50.668 --> 00:52.846
are in the supply closet
next to the elevator,

00:52.871 --> 00:55.181
which brings us right here
to the command center.

00:55.206 --> 00:57.164
- Deer in the headlights.
- Mm-hmm.

00:57.189 --> 00:58.806
- Nursling?
- Monique Lawson.

00:58.831 --> 01:01.509
She's got her Pediatric Advanced
Life Support certification,

01:01.534 --> 01:04.268
and is doing her E.D.
check-off skills training

01:04.293 --> 01:06.066
with yours truly.

01:06.091 --> 01:08.024
Be careful, she bites.

01:08.049 --> 01:10.571
Monique, Doris, move.

01:11.364 --> 01:14.565
I hardly slept last night. [laughs]

01:14.590 --> 01:15.876
I couldn't stop thinking.

01:15.912 --> 01:17.454
I mean, so many people coming in,

01:17.479 --> 01:18.564
horrible injuries.

01:18.589 --> 01:20.548
And this isn't even a busy day.

01:20.573 --> 01:22.532
I just hope I'm up to it.

01:22.557 --> 01:24.352
Quick, nurses' credo?

01:24.966 --> 01:28.377
Uh, cure sometimes,
treat often, comfort always.

01:28.402 --> 01:30.517
Uh-uh. Don't kill your patient...

01:30.542 --> 01:32.470
all: Because that's the doctor's job.

01:32.495 --> 01:35.028
- I heard that.
- [laughs]

01:35.053 --> 01:36.820
Maggie, what you got for me?

01:36.845 --> 01:38.094
Alzheimer's patient,

01:38.119 --> 01:39.752
here from long-term care facility.

01:39.777 --> 01:42.845
Hypotensive and high fever in Treatment 2.

01:42.870 --> 01:44.322
Any family? Advanced directives?

01:44.347 --> 01:46.447
No, surrogate just passed away,

01:46.472 --> 01:49.155
and no one else was designated,
so it's going to be our call.

01:50.043 --> 01:53.793
Okay, and you need to be
initiating catheter duty.

01:53.818 --> 01:56.825
Patient in Treatment 6. Have a stab at her.

02:02.124 --> 02:04.991
Wait, we need to page Will.

02:05.016 --> 02:05.975
What is it?

02:06.000 --> 02:08.459
This is Bella Rowan... Dr. Rowan.

02:08.484 --> 02:10.380
She was Will's teacher, his mentor.

02:10.405 --> 02:11.971
Okay.

02:34.651 --> 02:36.251
Lungs are wet.

02:39.722 --> 02:41.889
Does this hurt, Dr. Rowan?

02:41.914 --> 02:45.165
[laboring exhale]

02:46.174 --> 02:49.385
- Oh...
- Okay, all right, all right.

02:51.484 --> 02:53.965
Who are you?

02:54.924 --> 02:56.722
I'm Dr. Halstead.

02:57.365 --> 02:59.397
Oh...

02:59.501 --> 03:02.931
I'm gonna help Dr. Manning
here take care of you.

03:02.956 --> 03:05.354
- Is that all right?
- Oh, good.

03:05.379 --> 03:08.981
- Okay.
- Gotta go.

03:09.006 --> 03:12.182
- Why is that?
- Mm, miss my bus.

03:12.207 --> 03:15.571
Oh, where are you going?

03:17.237 --> 03:18.949
What?

03:19.578 --> 03:23.776
[coughing]

03:25.659 --> 03:27.197
Okay, okay, okay...

03:27.222 --> 03:28.955
- [moans]
- Tell you what, Dr. Rowan...

03:28.980 --> 03:30.337
[moaning]

03:31.255 --> 03:33.073
We promise to do our best,

03:33.098 --> 03:35.799
to get you out of here so
you can catch that bus.

03:35.824 --> 03:38.386
- How's that sound?
- Good.

03:38.411 --> 03:39.774
- Good.
- Good.

03:39.799 --> 03:42.056
[labored breathing]

03:42.081 --> 03:43.723
All right.

03:44.910 --> 03:47.394
I'll be back to check
on you in a few minutes.

03:52.219 --> 03:54.719
I'm pretty sure she's
got aspiration pneumonia.

03:54.744 --> 03:56.917
- Yeah.
- You start antibiotics?

03:56.942 --> 03:59.827
Vanc and Zosyn,
plus Levophed to maintain her pressure.

03:59.852 --> 04:01.088
Metabolic panel, urine analysis,

04:01.113 --> 04:03.410
and blood cultures are all pending.

04:03.435 --> 04:05.248
She's obviously been sick for days.

04:05.273 --> 04:07.139
Why did they wait so long to bring her in?

04:07.164 --> 04:08.323
I'm sorry, Will.

04:08.348 --> 04:11.716
Dr. Halstead, I came as soon as I heard.

04:11.741 --> 04:14.213
I was an O.R. nurse under Dr. Rowan

04:14.238 --> 04:16.089
when I was starting out.

04:16.115 --> 04:17.716
How is she?

04:17.741 --> 04:21.053
Not good, and we're playing catchup.

04:22.790 --> 04:24.970
All right, let's put in a central line

04:24.995 --> 04:26.026
and get a chest X-Ray,

04:26.051 --> 04:27.924
and I wanna keep close
tabs on her volume status.

04:27.950 --> 04:29.573
Please, keep me updated every 20 minutes.

04:29.598 --> 04:31.098
Of course.

04:36.157 --> 04:37.956
Hey, we went to Joe's last night.

04:37.981 --> 04:39.881
My sister loves stone crab.

04:39.906 --> 04:41.039
It was nice.

04:41.071 --> 04:41.932
I mean, there were a lot of years

04:41.958 --> 04:42.932
when Claire wasn't speaking to me.

04:42.957 --> 04:45.620
Eh, I'm sure she had very good reason.

04:45.865 --> 04:48.581
Well, she can tell you
all about it herself.

04:48.720 --> 04:51.362
- What do you mean?
- She wants to meet you.

04:51.387 --> 04:53.187
She wants to have you over for dinner.

04:53.212 --> 04:55.078
By meet, you mean grill?

04:55.103 --> 04:56.962
Make sure I'm worthy of a Rhodes?

04:56.987 --> 04:59.026
No, that's more my father.
Claire's not like that.

04:59.051 --> 05:02.469
She's happy if I'm happy, and I'm happy.

05:03.893 --> 05:08.026
I'm not sure if I'm ready to,
uh, meet the family.

05:08.377 --> 05:10.344
Morning, Dr. Rhodes.

05:10.369 --> 05:12.477
- Robin...
- Leah.

05:12.502 --> 05:15.487
Dr. Bardovi, are you ready for
your first coarctation repair?

05:15.512 --> 05:16.682
I've been studying cases all week.

05:16.707 --> 05:17.612
Good.

05:17.637 --> 05:20.003
Course there's nothing
like watching the maestro.

05:20.371 --> 05:22.123
[chuckles]

05:22.918 --> 05:26.257
I will catch you at lunch, Maestro.

05:26.282 --> 05:28.057
We'll continue this conversation later.

05:28.083 --> 05:30.183
Let's go.

05:30.632 --> 05:32.384
Patient's 13.

05:32.409 --> 05:34.370
Pretty late to get a coarctation diagnosis.

05:34.395 --> 05:38.182
Uh, his dad's an oil worker.
He did a stint in Nigeria.

05:38.207 --> 05:39.840
Nobody there caught it.

05:40.840 --> 05:42.773
Knock, knock?

05:43.143 --> 05:45.543
- Dr. Rhodes.
- Mitch, how are you doing?

05:45.568 --> 05:46.690
This is Dr. Bardovi.

05:46.715 --> 05:48.640
She's gonna be assisting me in the surgery.

05:49.186 --> 05:51.483
Brandon, how are we doing
this morning, bud?

05:51.508 --> 05:52.753
We are both looking forward to getting on

05:52.778 --> 05:55.375
the other side of this thing.
Ain't that right, buddy?

05:56.007 --> 05:58.407
Uh, yeah, sure.

05:58.682 --> 06:01.495
Hey, are you guys gonna have
to saw me open to do this?

06:01.520 --> 06:03.651
Yes. Yes, we are. [chuckles]

06:03.676 --> 06:04.956
I'm not scared.

06:04.981 --> 06:08.184
I'm just wondering if Halloran's
gonna have a cool scar

06:08.209 --> 06:10.287
after the battle of Madigan.

06:10.476 --> 06:12.937
- Halloran?
- It's a character

06:12.962 --> 06:15.167
in some dumb online game that he plays.

06:15.192 --> 06:18.587
Dad, it's not a game. It's fan fiction.

06:19.145 --> 06:20.778
I published a chapter today,

06:20.803 --> 06:23.401
and my followers are gonna wanna
know what happens to Halloran

06:23.426 --> 06:25.594
after he slays the High Locust.

06:26.071 --> 06:27.452
That's you.

06:27.477 --> 06:29.393
All right, then. Well, I am honored.

06:29.418 --> 06:33.653
And yes, Halloran's gonna have
a pretty gnarly battle scar.

06:33.683 --> 06:34.937
Sweet.

06:34.962 --> 06:38.315
Well, at least one of us isn't nervous.

06:39.312 --> 06:42.362
So, coarctation repair.

06:42.387 --> 06:43.526
It sounds complicated,

06:43.551 --> 06:46.018
but it's actually a
relatively simple procedure.

06:46.043 --> 06:48.807
Uh, I'm gonna make an incision
in Brandon's left chest.

06:48.832 --> 06:50.814
We'll place him on partial bypass,

06:50.839 --> 06:52.784
and then resect, or cut out,

06:52.809 --> 06:54.385
the narrowed portion of his aorta,

06:54.410 --> 06:55.707
and place a graft.

06:55.836 --> 06:57.627
Now I know all this is a lot,

06:57.652 --> 06:59.319
but any questions, feel free.

06:59.344 --> 07:02.088
Uh, yeah, I was doing some research online,

07:02.113 --> 07:04.341
and it seems that, uh,

07:04.555 --> 07:07.127
Brandon's chicken legs and his puny size

07:07.152 --> 07:09.182
are because of his condition?

07:09.207 --> 07:11.974
I mean, any chance that that'll change?

07:12.673 --> 07:17.646
Uh, obviously,
Brandon's health is our primary concern,

07:17.671 --> 07:20.354
uh, but yes,
he may grow at a more rapid rate

07:20.379 --> 07:22.667
once the blood flow issue is corrected.

07:23.159 --> 07:26.060
Good. [exhales] Okay.

07:26.085 --> 07:29.245
All right, Brandon,
see ya on the battle field.

07:39.438 --> 07:41.420
Dr. Reese?

07:41.638 --> 07:43.588
You didn't answer your page.

07:44.109 --> 07:45.976
Oh, sorry.

07:46.001 --> 07:49.136
I... I was just...

07:51.265 --> 07:53.366
Uh...

07:58.413 --> 08:01.815
When Jason Wheeler jumped,
do you think he was scared?

08:02.678 --> 08:04.311
Was...

08:04.570 --> 08:08.530
I mean, was... was he at peace?

08:10.532 --> 08:12.102
Right before he stepped off,

08:12.127 --> 08:14.162
was there a moment of regret?

08:16.849 --> 08:20.667
I just...
I just can't stop thinking about him.

08:23.939 --> 08:25.696
Yeah.

08:26.089 --> 08:28.603
But see, I... I don't want to,

08:28.628 --> 08:32.188
and then I feel guilty, because I don't.

08:33.967 --> 08:36.224
The thing about suicide,

08:36.534 --> 08:38.769
it's never really a lone act.

08:39.671 --> 08:42.472
It tends to leave a lot
of victims in its wake.

08:44.332 --> 08:48.079
I'd be lying if I said I'd been
sleeping too well recently.

08:51.499 --> 08:54.663
But, um... but you and I...

08:55.614 --> 08:57.380
We've got work to do.

09:00.500 --> 09:02.420
Excuse me.

09:03.077 --> 09:05.585
Sean Adams, formal Naval aviator,

09:05.610 --> 09:07.280
now flies for a private charter company.

09:07.305 --> 09:08.813
And he was doing his pre-flight check

09:08.839 --> 09:09.532
and felt faint.

09:09.557 --> 09:12.024
Co-pilot brought him in.
Says it's not the first time.

09:12.049 --> 09:14.577
Now I checked Mr. Adams out.
Can't find anything wrong.

09:14.602 --> 09:16.402
Probably just dehydrated and overworked.

09:16.427 --> 09:18.000
Says he feels fine and wants to go.

09:18.025 --> 09:19.945
So, um... so why are we here?

09:20.021 --> 09:22.312
Charter company wants a psych evaluation.

09:22.337 --> 09:24.189
Uh-huh.

09:24.910 --> 09:27.678
Co-pilot says he's also
been acting different.

09:27.890 --> 09:29.473
Doesn't go out with the boys anymore,

09:29.498 --> 09:31.364
naps a lot,

09:31.452 --> 09:33.319
seems to be low energy. Huh.

09:33.344 --> 09:34.672
Sounds like depression.

09:34.697 --> 09:36.608
- Possibly.
- In any case,

09:36.633 --> 09:38.930
the company won't let him
fly till you sign off.

09:38.955 --> 09:40.274
Why don't we have a little chat?

09:40.299 --> 09:41.732
Thanks.

09:43.553 --> 09:45.460
Code blue!

09:46.911 --> 09:49.278
Unresponsive two-year-old.
Quick, what do we do first?

09:49.303 --> 09:51.290
Check pulse, start compressions.

09:51.461 --> 09:54.385
- There is no pulse.
- Compressions at what rate?

09:54.410 --> 09:56.946
- 150 beats per minute.
- Good.

09:56.971 --> 09:59.618
You got a team behind you. What's next?

09:59.643 --> 10:01.643
I tell them to start bagging.

10:01.668 --> 10:03.032
Pulse check.

10:03.057 --> 10:05.087
Okay, but there's still no pulse.

10:05.682 --> 10:07.248
Patient's dying. What now?

10:07.273 --> 10:10.303
Use the paddles to do a quick look.

10:10.650 --> 10:12.771
Shows v-fib. She's coding, so?

10:13.148 --> 10:15.701
Need to shock at 4 joules per kilo?

10:15.726 --> 10:18.260
Well, move then. You're losing her.

10:18.285 --> 10:20.248
Charge to 28 joules.

10:20.273 --> 10:21.787
I'm shocking the patient.

10:21.812 --> 10:23.093
Great.

10:23.230 --> 10:24.896
You just killed me.

10:24.921 --> 10:26.483
- I did?
- Mm-hmm.

10:26.508 --> 10:28.608
You forgot to yell "clear" before shocking.

10:28.633 --> 10:30.568
Just one of those minor details.

10:30.593 --> 10:33.175
Reset. Let's take it from the top.

10:33.237 --> 10:35.802
Come on.

10:36.012 --> 10:38.247
It just seems like everyone's overreacting.

10:38.272 --> 10:39.576
But you can see their point of view.

10:39.607 --> 10:41.420
I mean,
people put their lives in your hands.

10:41.445 --> 10:42.482
And I'm fine.

10:42.507 --> 10:45.443
I've answered your question.
I know what today is.

10:45.468 --> 10:47.272
I know where I am.

10:47.630 --> 10:49.945
Aside from lack of energy,

10:49.970 --> 10:53.450
your co-pilot says that at
times you seem mildly confused.

10:53.475 --> 10:55.099
I have no idea what he's talking about.

10:55.124 --> 10:56.423
[stammers, laughs]

10:56.448 --> 10:58.282
Maybe he's the one that's confused.

10:58.441 --> 11:01.873
Mr. Adams, I imagine there's
a lot of pressure at your job.

11:02.406 --> 11:05.404
I used to land F-14s on
an aircraft carrier.

11:05.429 --> 11:07.229
That's pressure.

11:07.459 --> 11:09.500
Have you ever had thoughts
of hurting yourself?

11:09.525 --> 11:11.577
What? No.

11:11.676 --> 11:14.217
Let's see here. Are you on any medication?

11:14.242 --> 11:15.408
You mean do I take anything

11:15.433 --> 11:16.725
that might affect my performance?

11:16.750 --> 11:18.260
No.

11:18.419 --> 11:21.431
I take a statin,
like 10 million other Americans.

11:21.610 --> 11:24.327
And no, I don't drink,
if that's your next question.

11:24.352 --> 11:27.795
All right, Mr. Adams, well,
thank you for your time.

11:34.131 --> 11:37.060
Getting, um, a little ahead of yourself.

11:37.085 --> 11:37.757
Don't you think?

11:37.782 --> 11:40.454
Well, he is exhibiting signs of depression,

11:40.479 --> 11:42.669
and there is a high rate
of suicide among pilots.

11:42.694 --> 11:43.671
Dr. Reese, trust me,

11:43.696 --> 11:46.908
I understand what's on your mind,
but suicidality

11:46.933 --> 11:49.367
should not necessarily
be a default diagnosis.

11:49.401 --> 11:50.483
So what do you think?

11:50.508 --> 11:53.146
I think that Mr. Adams is linear, lucid.

11:53.171 --> 11:54.561
I mean, he's certainly not confused.

11:54.586 --> 11:56.300
Are you gonna sign off on him?

11:56.325 --> 11:57.711
Well, I didn't say that.

11:57.736 --> 12:00.136
I mean, I thought he was a little defensive

12:00.161 --> 12:01.761
around the medication issue.

12:01.786 --> 12:03.796
Well, the man has to prove
himself to keep his job.

12:03.821 --> 12:05.221
That would make me defensive.

12:05.246 --> 12:07.060
And you know what,
that could be all there is to it.

12:07.085 --> 12:10.014
But look, he's a pilot.
Let's just take the extra step.

12:10.039 --> 12:12.264
You know, run a tox screen,
make sure he's clean.

12:12.289 --> 12:13.688
Okay.

12:13.713 --> 12:16.233
To your point,
depressives often self-medicate,

12:16.258 --> 12:19.155
so I'm not ruling out the diagnosis.

12:21.131 --> 12:22.858
Dr. Rowan's LFTs are high,

12:22.883 --> 12:24.545
her creatinine's through the roof.

12:24.570 --> 12:26.270
Kidneys are struggling.

12:26.295 --> 12:27.961
White cell count's high too.

12:27.986 --> 12:31.459
Multiple organ failure and
pending respiratory failure.

12:31.811 --> 12:34.721
- We need to intubate her.
- What... at her age?

12:34.746 --> 12:36.772
- Nurse!
- No, mm, Will...

12:36.797 --> 12:39.631
you know what this means.
She might never get off.

12:39.796 --> 12:41.528
What if we bridge her with BiPAP?

12:41.553 --> 12:42.829
That'll take the stress off the lungs,

12:42.854 --> 12:44.132
until the infection cools.

12:44.157 --> 12:45.690
We'd still wind up intubating her,

12:45.715 --> 12:48.282
- and we'd have lost time.
- Dr. Halstead...

12:48.307 --> 12:50.959
there's a Mr. Sherwood
here from the nursing home.

12:50.984 --> 12:53.577
He wants to know how Dr. Rowan is doing.

12:53.602 --> 12:56.359
I'll be happy to tell him.

12:57.000 --> 12:59.321
Sherwood, is it?

13:00.265 --> 13:02.298
You mind telling me how you and your staff

13:02.324 --> 13:04.162
let a textbook case of aspiration pneumonia

13:04.187 --> 13:05.577
go unattended?

13:05.823 --> 13:08.383
I-I don't think that happened.

13:08.408 --> 13:09.460
You don't?

13:09.485 --> 13:11.740
Then... then how was she allowed
to aspirate in the first place?

13:11.765 --> 13:13.832
- Dr. Halstead...
- 'cause I...

13:13.857 --> 13:15.498
I visited her every month.

13:15.523 --> 13:16.780
I knew she had trouble swallowing.

13:16.805 --> 13:17.983
Your staff knew she had trouble swallowing.

13:18.008 --> 13:20.072
Okay, I-I promise you I'll look into this.

13:20.097 --> 13:22.802
- I'm sure you will.
- Oh, you better.

13:22.827 --> 13:25.826
I mean, that she...
that Dr. Rowan should come to this,

13:25.851 --> 13:29.086
all because you denied her
the most basic... hey!

13:29.111 --> 13:30.991
Dr. Halstead...

13:32.522 --> 13:35.148
Thank you, Mr. Sherwood.

13:36.382 --> 13:37.859
Will...

13:37.945 --> 13:39.945
They're criminals.

13:40.698 --> 13:43.897
I mean, we should call IDPH,
have their license revoked.

13:50.514 --> 13:54.373
<i>You've all achieved
something very special today.</i>

13:54.785 --> 13:58.631
<i>Now you're physicians, doctors.</i>

13:58.878 --> 14:01.946
<i>In a few months,
you'll begin your residencies,</i>

14:02.049 --> 14:04.640
<i>caring for people in need.</i>

14:04.753 --> 14:08.202
<i>If you take one thing away from me today,</i>

14:08.227 --> 14:10.308
<i>let it be this.</i>

14:11.698 --> 14:15.670
<i>Treat the patient, not the disease.</i>

14:17.494 --> 14:19.897
- Brought you some Vitner's.
- Ah...

14:19.922 --> 14:22.487
- Triple cheese. [chuckles]
- Thanks.

14:23.294 --> 14:25.128
Dr. Rowan?

14:27.023 --> 14:29.023
I'm really sorry, Will.

14:29.351 --> 14:31.451
- I know how hard it'll be...
- No.

14:31.476 --> 14:34.124
No, if we can get her temp
down and her sats up,

14:34.714 --> 14:36.542
I think we'll be over the hump.

14:36.865 --> 14:38.545
Hm.

14:39.160 --> 14:40.726
Kay.

14:44.299 --> 14:45.932
I just remember when my grandma got sick,

14:45.957 --> 14:48.053
how tough it was for my mom.

14:48.161 --> 14:51.226
The options, decisions... [chuckles]

14:51.251 --> 14:54.619
Seeing my grandma so ill.

14:54.644 --> 14:57.377
It was awful.

14:57.402 --> 14:59.983
Yeah, I hear what you're saying.

15:00.560 --> 15:03.903
But, Nina, she can beat this.

15:04.885 --> 15:07.266
Dr. Rowan gave me so much.

15:07.655 --> 15:09.852
Getting her through this,

15:10.317 --> 15:12.578
it's the least I can do.

15:16.343 --> 15:18.576
Enter the patient's first and last name,

15:18.601 --> 15:20.555
select an urgency level,

15:20.580 --> 15:23.068
pick your labs, and then hit submit.

15:23.093 --> 15:24.325
Okay.

15:25.870 --> 15:27.176
- Excuse me...
- Yep.

15:27.201 --> 15:29.568
I'm looking for my husband, Sean Adams.

15:29.593 --> 15:31.526
He's in Treatment 4. I'll page his doctor.

15:31.551 --> 15:33.183
Thank you.

15:36.157 --> 15:37.790
How's it look?

15:37.815 --> 15:40.085
Systolic's still 50 higher in the arms,

15:40.110 --> 15:42.376
but that's not uncommon
right after surgery.

15:42.400 --> 15:44.797
It should come down in
the next 24 hours or so.

15:46.587 --> 15:50.623
It looks like Halloran slayed
the High Locust after all.

15:55.014 --> 15:58.045
Hey, um, so how much longer

15:58.070 --> 16:00.711
before he's up and running around?

16:01.314 --> 16:02.939
Uh, well, over the next few months,

16:02.964 --> 16:04.523
you should see an increase in energy

16:04.548 --> 16:07.416
and some improvement in muscle development.

16:07.577 --> 16:09.235
Oh, thanks. I can't tell ya.

16:09.260 --> 16:12.311
I've been dreaming about the
day I could get out in the yard

16:12.336 --> 16:15.767
and toss a football with my son,
like my dad did with me.

16:15.954 --> 16:17.954
Well, hopefully that'll happen.

16:18.065 --> 16:21.199
Right now,
why don't you just let him get some rest?

16:25.801 --> 16:28.035
See, Mr. Adams, as part of our evaluation,

16:28.060 --> 16:29.652
we run a toxicology screen,

16:29.677 --> 16:31.920
and I'm happy to say that yours was normal.

16:32.517 --> 16:34.517
I told you I don't take drugs.

16:34.574 --> 16:36.808
However, we did find something else.

16:36.833 --> 16:38.933
- Profound anemia.
- Anemia?

16:38.958 --> 16:41.263
It could explain your feeling faint.

16:41.594 --> 16:44.010
Okay, I-I guess I gotta eat more steak.
[chuckles]

16:44.035 --> 16:45.669
It's actually more serious than that.

16:45.694 --> 16:46.827
We need to transfuse you

16:46.852 --> 16:48.396
with several units of blood right away.

16:48.421 --> 16:50.018
We also need to find out what's causing it,

16:50.043 --> 16:51.977
so I'd like to admit you for
a battery of scans and tests.

16:52.002 --> 16:53.287
Uh-uh, I've got my own doctor.

16:53.312 --> 16:54.623
I'll make an appointment with him.

16:54.648 --> 16:56.576
Mr. Adams, we don't want you
to leave in this condition.

16:56.601 --> 16:57.912
- You're not well.
- I feel fine.

16:57.937 --> 16:59.365
Sean, are you sure about that?

16:59.390 --> 17:01.289
Yes, and a car ride home

17:01.314 --> 17:03.365
and sleeping in my own
bed isn't gonna hurt me.

17:03.390 --> 17:04.888
That may not be true.

17:04.914 --> 17:08.153
I-I emphatically recommend that
you take Dr. Choi's advice.

17:08.238 --> 17:09.804
As far as the psych evaluation goes,

17:09.829 --> 17:11.196
am I in the clear?

17:11.512 --> 17:13.943
Well, not listening to your physician

17:13.968 --> 17:15.396
isn't the greatest sign to me.

17:15.421 --> 17:17.489
Well, you're not the only
psychiatrist in Chicago.

17:17.513 --> 17:19.090
I'll get a referral from my primary.

17:19.116 --> 17:20.482
- Sean...
- Viv, we're going.

17:20.507 --> 17:21.673
Hand me my clothes.

17:21.698 --> 17:23.498
Please get me whatever
paperwork I need to sign,

17:23.522 --> 17:24.877
so I can get out of here.

17:24.902 --> 17:26.768
I'll be back shortly.

17:29.597 --> 17:31.160
Something's just not right with him.

17:31.185 --> 17:33.318
- I agree.
- But is it physical or mental?

17:33.343 --> 17:34.816
Your guess is as good as mine.

17:34.841 --> 17:37.181
Unfortunately,
we have no grounds to hold him.

17:37.603 --> 17:39.603
I'll get the paperwork ready.

17:43.296 --> 17:45.739
Okay, so your patient is in SVT.

17:45.764 --> 17:47.233
What do you do?

17:47.862 --> 17:51.278
Um, cardiovert at 7 joules.

17:51.303 --> 17:52.091
Right.

17:52.116 --> 17:53.912
So she's back in sinus rhythm. What now?

17:53.937 --> 17:55.169
- Check her vitals...
- Mm-hmm.

17:55.194 --> 17:57.201
Establish IV access,

17:57.226 --> 17:59.842
provide fluids if her BP
drops below 75 systolic.

17:59.866 --> 18:02.934
And? The adenosine? You got a dose?

18:02.959 --> 18:04.392
Um...

18:05.938 --> 18:07.506
Adenosine is scratched out.

18:07.531 --> 18:08.930
Calculate then.

18:08.955 --> 18:10.786
Your patient's gonna revert back to SVT.

18:10.811 --> 18:12.377
- Come on.
- Um...

18:12.402 --> 18:13.825
It's a life and death situation here.

18:13.850 --> 18:16.346
6.5 milligrams of adenosine.

18:16.923 --> 18:19.177
♪ Dum, dum, duh-dum ♪

18:19.202 --> 18:21.703
♪ Dum, dum, dum, dum, dum, dum, dum ♪

18:21.728 --> 18:24.937
It's 0.65, not 6.5. Here.

18:25.130 --> 18:27.505
Oh... [sighs] I'm sorry.

18:27.530 --> 18:28.796
[sighs]

18:31.326 --> 18:35.114
- What happened?
- He can't feel his left arm.

18:35.680 --> 18:37.604
All right, left BP is 80 over 30.

18:37.629 --> 18:39.696
Check the right. Sat's at 70.

18:39.721 --> 18:42.193
Hey, Brandon, can you squeeze my hand?

18:42.466 --> 18:44.775
[gasps] No. No, I can't.

18:44.800 --> 18:47.300
- Okay.
- Right arm's 150 over 100.

18:47.325 --> 18:48.858
What's... what's going on?

18:48.883 --> 18:51.214
All right, legs are cold.
We need a CT angio now!

18:51.239 --> 18:51.958
Got it!

18:52.139 --> 18:54.443
- Dad?
- What is happening?

18:54.468 --> 18:56.451
Brandon's not getting
blood to his left arm,

18:56.476 --> 18:58.176
but I need a picture of it to see.

18:58.201 --> 19:00.811
It's possible that the graft
we put in has become occluded.

19:00.836 --> 19:02.670
Occlud... occluded? What does that mean?

19:02.695 --> 19:04.155
The first surgery may not have worked.

19:04.180 --> 19:05.882
So you have to do it again?

19:05.907 --> 19:09.357
It may be more complicated than that.

19:16.006 --> 19:18.074
She's in v-fib!

19:20.629 --> 19:22.119
Paddles. Start compressions.

19:22.144 --> 19:25.692
- Will, I'll break her ribs.
- Charge to 200 joules.

19:26.223 --> 19:27.944
Star compressions now!

19:27.969 --> 19:30.123
Are you sure? I...

19:30.148 --> 19:32.629
- Out of my way.
- No, Will.

19:32.654 --> 19:35.091
[valve hissing]

19:35.996 --> 19:38.430
- Are we charged?
- 200 joules.

19:38.455 --> 19:40.989
Holding the CPR. Clear.

19:43.046 --> 19:46.215
One milligram of epi, charge to 200 again.

19:46.978 --> 19:49.856
- 200.
- All right, clear.

19:52.225 --> 19:54.610
Pulse is good.

20:13.138 --> 20:14.927
Hey.

20:16.268 --> 20:19.661
Dr. Halstead decided to intubate.

20:23.176 --> 20:27.208
You know, this woman is the
reason I stayed in nursing.

20:27.681 --> 20:30.215
My first year as an O.R. nurse,

20:30.240 --> 20:32.224
I actually thought about quitting.

20:32.249 --> 20:34.558
- You?
- Oh, I had a rough time.

20:34.583 --> 20:35.997
[chuckles]

20:36.151 --> 20:39.833
There was this, um, surgery I scrubbed on.

20:39.858 --> 20:41.762
I think it was a vascular case.

20:41.787 --> 20:44.779
The resident asked for a ten blade scalpel.

20:45.091 --> 20:48.459
It slipped out of my hand,
dropped in the incision.

20:48.484 --> 20:51.385
- Oh, my God.
- It didn't hurt the patient,

20:51.410 --> 20:55.107
but that resident reamed me out.

20:55.437 --> 20:58.621
Dr. Rowan stepped in, called him out,

20:58.646 --> 21:03.576
said everyone in the O.R.
deserved civility.

21:03.601 --> 21:04.771
Everyone.

21:05.673 --> 21:07.934
Bella Rowan.

21:09.715 --> 21:11.951
Wonderful woman.

21:13.616 --> 21:16.209
Extraordinary teacher.

21:20.544 --> 21:22.912
Sean? Sean, oh, my God.

21:22.937 --> 21:26.098
Oh, my God. Uh, help, someone!

21:26.123 --> 21:28.290
Help my husband, please.

21:28.315 --> 21:30.114
Okay, hey, I need a gurney here.

21:30.139 --> 21:31.576
Whoa! Mr. Adams, can you hear me?

21:31.601 --> 21:33.767
- What's wrong with him?
- Unresponsive,

21:33.792 --> 21:35.471
has a pulse. Let's get him in a room.

21:35.496 --> 21:37.546
Bring it over here.

21:37.571 --> 21:39.131
[whimpers]

21:39.156 --> 21:41.734
Let's transfer on my count.
Ready, one, two, three.

21:41.759 --> 21:42.992
- [grunts]
- [whimpers]

21:43.017 --> 21:44.669
- Here we go.
- All right, he's not breathing.

21:44.694 --> 21:47.091
Get a laryngoscope and a 7.5 ET tube.

21:47.116 --> 21:49.516
- Sean!
- Trauma 1 to prep.

21:50.129 --> 21:52.724
He's totally flaccid. Don't need drugs.

21:54.297 --> 21:56.264
Monique, you start the IV.

21:56.289 --> 21:57.733
Okay.

21:58.327 --> 21:59.787
Sean...

21:59.812 --> 22:01.574
- Okay, you stand right here.
- Okay.

22:01.599 --> 22:03.107
He's got a massive upper GI bleed.

22:03.132 --> 22:04.607
His stomach's filling with blood.

22:04.938 --> 22:06.865
I'm in. April, listen to his lungs.

22:06.890 --> 22:08.389
Yep.

22:11.027 --> 22:12.393
Good breath sounds bilaterally.

22:12.418 --> 22:13.428
All right, hang two units of blood

22:13.461 --> 22:15.108
- and get another four ready.
- What's going on?

22:15.132 --> 22:16.442
- Why... why is this happening?
- I don't know,

22:16.467 --> 22:18.147
but we're gonna find out.

22:18.576 --> 22:20.215
- [valve hissing]
- Hang saline.

22:20.240 --> 22:23.068
- Saline's up.
- All right, stay on it.

22:31.267 --> 22:33.269
Got your page.

22:33.536 --> 22:35.646
Dr. Rowan's latest labs.

22:36.568 --> 22:38.870
I am so sorry. She's in
acute renal failure.

22:38.895 --> 22:41.694
Hyperkalemic and still acidotic.

22:43.476 --> 22:46.667
All right,
we'll start her on low flow dialysis.

22:46.692 --> 22:48.468
It should correct her electrolytes and PH.

22:48.493 --> 22:49.753
Will...

22:50.352 --> 22:52.329
I won't stand by and let her die.

22:54.885 --> 22:56.852
Tell April to call renal.

22:59.386 --> 23:01.097
[sighs]

23:03.367 --> 23:06.652
Graft occlusion is a possible
outcome of any vascular surgery.

23:06.677 --> 23:08.471
It's nobody's fault.

23:08.842 --> 23:10.814
Okay, so there are two options, right?

23:10.839 --> 23:13.934
- We could either...
- Just let me handle this, okay?

23:15.784 --> 23:17.916
Mitch, a moment?

23:17.941 --> 23:19.474
Uh...

23:22.048 --> 23:23.903
What is it?

23:24.393 --> 23:26.430
So the CT revealed that the graft

23:26.454 --> 23:28.174
I placed in Brandon's chest kinked,

23:28.199 --> 23:29.892
causing re-coarctation,

23:29.917 --> 23:33.768
or essentially a, uh...
A narrowing of his aorta.

23:33.793 --> 23:35.582
Like before?

23:36.249 --> 23:37.982
I'm sorry.

23:38.203 --> 23:41.904
So... so what?
We're just back at square one?

23:41.929 --> 23:45.423
Yes, but this time,
things are more complicated.

23:45.610 --> 23:47.893
Now I can repair the
graft by placing a stent,

23:47.918 --> 23:49.430
and we would do that in the cath lab.

23:49.869 --> 23:51.449
But the stent will cover

23:51.474 --> 23:54.433
the opening of his left subclavian artery.

23:54.877 --> 23:58.270
That will cut off
circulation to his left arm,

23:59.023 --> 24:02.274
meaning Brandon will lose that arm.

24:03.098 --> 24:06.111
- Lose his arm?
- Mm-hmm.

24:12.002 --> 24:13.869
Uh, no.

24:13.894 --> 24:17.269
No... [stammers]... he can't. He can't.

24:17.294 --> 24:19.708
It...
there must be something else you can do.

24:21.131 --> 24:23.045
I'm sorry, but no.

24:23.231 --> 24:25.714
I'm afraid this is our only viable option.

24:27.712 --> 24:30.025
Oh, God.

24:30.860 --> 24:31.992
Hey, look, Mitch,

24:32.017 --> 24:34.084
why don't you go be with your son, okay?

24:34.109 --> 24:36.350
We'll take him up to surgery soon.

24:36.672 --> 24:38.172
I'm very sorry.

24:39.691 --> 24:41.588
[sighs]

24:42.719 --> 24:44.419
Pardon me, Dr. Rhodes.

24:44.444 --> 24:46.080
I know you must've had a very good reason,

24:46.105 --> 24:48.206
but you didn't present the other option,

24:48.231 --> 24:49.853
the carotid subclavian bypass.

24:49.878 --> 24:52.268
Wouldn't that preserve Brandon's arm?

24:52.293 --> 24:55.595
Dr. Bardovi, 20 to 30% of young patients

24:55.620 --> 24:57.987
will stroke out and possibly die

24:58.012 --> 24:59.456
when you clamp their carotid.

24:59.481 --> 25:00.673
It's too big of a risk. Okay, but still-

25:00.698 --> 25:03.265
It's too big of a risk.

25:10.337 --> 25:12.553
What was that all about?

25:13.682 --> 25:16.750
Look, this boy's father... I know the type.

25:16.775 --> 25:18.051
I grew up with one.

25:18.076 --> 25:20.087
He wants his son to be something he isn't.

25:20.112 --> 25:23.150
He'll choose the bypass.
It's too dangerous.

25:23.190 --> 25:25.523
But it's his decision, not yours.

25:25.626 --> 25:27.430
I already opened Brandon up once.

25:27.455 --> 25:28.290
I'm not gonna do it again.

25:28.315 --> 25:29.580
I'm not gonna risk this boy's life

25:29.605 --> 25:31.472
just to save his arm.

25:33.176 --> 25:36.165
[sighs]

25:42.052 --> 25:43.586
Huge gastric ulcer.

25:43.611 --> 25:45.279
That's where all the blood was coming from.

25:45.304 --> 25:46.490
Were you able to stop the bleeding?

25:46.515 --> 25:49.286
Yeah, GI cauterized it,
but that's not the headline.

25:49.467 --> 25:53.238
Sean's endoscopy shows chronic
caustic esophageal erosions.

25:53.730 --> 25:55.559
And his chest X-Ray...

25:55.683 --> 25:58.418
- Pneumonitis.
- Yeah.

25:58.498 --> 26:00.121
This is a pattern suggestive of ingesting

26:00.146 --> 26:02.106
some sort of hydrocarbon.

26:02.350 --> 26:04.028
Isn't that in cleaning products?

26:04.053 --> 26:07.021
And lighter fluid, motor oil, gasoline.

26:07.217 --> 26:09.816
Extremely toxic, so we
must be talking about

26:09.996 --> 26:12.053
low doses over a long period of time.

26:12.078 --> 26:13.377
So I was right.

26:13.402 --> 26:14.945
We should be concerned he's suicidal.

26:14.970 --> 26:16.674
Why assume he's doing this to himself?

26:16.676 --> 26:19.327
Well, what,
you think someone's poisoning him?

26:19.352 --> 26:20.933
I don't know. It's possible.

26:20.958 --> 26:22.581
I had a case where a wife
was slipping something

26:22.606 --> 26:23.865
into her husband's food.

26:23.890 --> 26:25.488
So you think it's his wife?

26:26.199 --> 26:28.510
You know,
hydrocarbons are extremely noxious,

26:28.535 --> 26:31.090
- so he would've smelled it.
- Not necessarily.

26:31.205 --> 26:32.979
They're all over any aircraft hanger.

26:33.004 --> 26:34.949
With constant exposure,
he could be nose blind.

26:34.974 --> 26:37.254
I don't know. Suicide?

26:37.279 --> 26:38.847
Attempted murder?

26:39.173 --> 26:41.707
I think it might be
something else altogether.

26:52.791 --> 26:55.814
I just checked in on Dr. Rowan.

26:56.066 --> 26:58.369
I heard you ordered dialysis.

26:58.580 --> 27:00.148
She's in renal failure.

27:00.173 --> 27:01.406
That's the appropriate treatment.

27:01.431 --> 27:04.498
I understand the medicine, doctor.

27:05.678 --> 27:08.602
- Even if you dialyze her...
- I am.

27:08.627 --> 27:10.384
Even if you dialyze her,

27:10.409 --> 27:13.043
she's unlikely to come off the vent.

27:13.068 --> 27:15.509
That means she'll be bedridden.

27:15.613 --> 27:18.790
Eventually, she'll need a tracheostomy.

27:21.363 --> 27:23.781
You've already broken her ribs.

27:24.668 --> 27:28.257
Now she'll have bed sores, a feeding tube.

27:29.835 --> 27:35.487
Shouldn't quality of
life be a consideration?

27:52.972 --> 27:55.781
I mean,
remember that ballplayer I told you about?

27:55.806 --> 27:59.178
He was a pitcher with one arm.
He was one of the best.

27:59.508 --> 28:03.413
All right, so, you know, be strong.

28:03.438 --> 28:05.226
We can do this.

28:05.251 --> 28:07.895
I mean, the important thing
is that you're gonna be alive.

28:07.920 --> 28:09.563
And healthy.

28:10.848 --> 28:14.317
We'll figure out the rest, okay? Together.

28:15.973 --> 28:17.758
- Mitch...
- Yeah.

28:17.783 --> 28:19.490
Guys, if you can hold on for a second.

28:19.515 --> 28:22.633
- Have a word with you?
- Okay, buddy.

28:25.788 --> 28:28.415
So, I've been thinking
about Brandon's case,

28:28.824 --> 28:32.419
and there is something else we can try.

28:34.627 --> 28:37.084
- [device whirs]
- Wrong angle.

28:37.109 --> 28:40.038
You need to go in perpendicular,
or you'll stay in the cortex.

28:40.063 --> 28:41.874
Okay.

28:42.813 --> 28:45.557
[device whirring]

28:45.993 --> 28:47.293
You're too shallow.

28:47.318 --> 28:50.312
You need to keep on drilling
until you hub the needle.

28:54.623 --> 28:56.423
Not like that.

28:56.729 --> 28:58.811
Who taught her how to do an IO?
An orangutan?

28:58.836 --> 29:01.281
Okay. She'll get there.

29:02.545 --> 29:05.869
We've all gone through this.
Just take it slowly.

29:07.179 --> 29:09.039
Go ahead.

29:10.040 --> 29:13.168
[device whirs]

29:14.111 --> 29:15.610
There you go.

29:23.320 --> 29:26.557
White board says carotid subclavian bypass.

29:26.993 --> 29:28.560
It's just, I thought...

29:28.585 --> 29:31.007
I presented both options
to the patient's father.

29:31.281 --> 29:35.148
As I suspected,
he chose the carotid subclavian bypass.

29:35.625 --> 29:38.092
And you're gonna do a great job, Dr.
Rhodes.

29:38.250 --> 29:40.092
You're an exceptional surgeon,
and it is an honor to be...

29:40.117 --> 29:42.156
Dr. Bardovi, you don't have to do that.

29:43.512 --> 29:45.450
You're a fine surgeon,

29:45.904 --> 29:48.507
and trust me,
I'm a less than perfect teacher.

29:54.119 --> 29:57.337
Mr. Adams, can I ask you, um...

29:58.031 --> 30:00.362
You ever find yourself doing something

30:00.387 --> 30:02.273
that you know you shouldn't,

30:02.391 --> 30:04.303
but you just can't stop?

30:04.852 --> 30:07.281
I have no idea what you're talking about.

30:07.306 --> 30:09.006
[chuckles]

30:09.277 --> 30:12.177
My wife would say that I...
I watch too much football.

30:12.202 --> 30:13.937
[chuckles]

30:14.032 --> 30:16.599
Can I tell you my dirty little secret?

30:16.773 --> 30:17.975
I went through this phase

30:18.000 --> 30:20.742
where I would come home every night,

30:21.391 --> 30:25.125
cut my nails every night,
like down to the quick.

30:25.801 --> 30:27.768
Hm, couldn't stop.

30:27.950 --> 30:32.085
On some level,
I must've been satisfying some urge,

30:32.110 --> 30:34.562
but my hands were bleeding.

30:34.786 --> 30:36.652
[stammers]

30:36.677 --> 30:38.195
It wasn't good.

30:38.368 --> 30:39.900
And the point of this?

30:39.925 --> 30:43.094
The point is that I understand
compulsive behavior.

30:43.887 --> 30:46.037
You know, it's not rational.
You can't explain it.

30:46.062 --> 30:48.382
You just... you just do it.

30:49.417 --> 30:51.430
Yeah, but eventually,

30:52.043 --> 30:55.257
like with me, your fingers bleed,

30:55.465 --> 30:57.226
or something similar.

30:57.774 --> 31:01.094
And it just starts to...
To cost you too much,

31:01.549 --> 31:03.383
and you wanna stop.

31:04.027 --> 31:07.156
I mean, you realize that it's
interfering with your life,

31:07.181 --> 31:10.375
and you...
you just really, really wanna stop.

31:13.007 --> 31:15.390
Sean, I think you have a compulsion,

31:15.415 --> 31:18.783
and you're tired,

31:18.808 --> 31:20.820
and you're also getting scared.

31:20.856 --> 31:22.046
I mean, who wouldn't be scared?

31:22.071 --> 31:25.342
All that... all that blood?
All that vomiting?

31:35.058 --> 31:36.552
Yes.

31:39.411 --> 31:41.177
I'm tired.

31:46.883 --> 31:48.557
Mr. Adams, we think you're ingesting

31:48.582 --> 31:51.076
something very harmful.

31:52.062 --> 31:53.762
Can you tell us what it is?

31:58.194 --> 32:01.775
Mr. Adams, please, we can help you.

32:06.546 --> 32:08.144
Gasoline.

32:08.169 --> 32:10.139
I'm sorry? Say again?

32:13.441 --> 32:15.267
I drank gasoline.

32:25.059 --> 32:27.724
Is my husband crazy?

32:28.911 --> 32:31.676
Why would anyone drink gasoline?

32:31.701 --> 32:34.317
I know it's very difficult to fathom,

32:34.591 --> 32:37.441
but I'm quite sure that your
husband is suffering from

32:37.466 --> 32:40.364
a psychiatric disorder known as Pica,

32:40.740 --> 32:45.090
which involves the compulsive
consumption of non-nutritive,

32:45.115 --> 32:48.052
and sometimes even hazardous, substances.

32:48.356 --> 32:50.456
For some, it's paint chips.

32:50.544 --> 32:52.720
For others, dirt.

32:53.208 --> 32:55.557
For your husband, it's gasoline.

32:55.829 --> 32:57.462
Why?

32:57.487 --> 33:00.567
There's no unified theory as to the cause.

33:00.702 --> 33:03.737
All we know is that it manifests
itself as a compulsion,

33:03.762 --> 33:07.841
an irresistible urge,
against one's conscious wishes.

33:08.059 --> 33:10.572
[sighs] Can he stop?

33:10.597 --> 33:12.630
Probably not on his own,

33:12.655 --> 33:15.122
but if he'll allow us, we can help him.

33:15.797 --> 33:17.443
Okay.

33:18.084 --> 33:20.817
We'll do whatever it
takes to get him healthy.

33:21.507 --> 33:23.808
Before we discuss the
course of psychotherapy,

33:23.833 --> 33:25.287
I'd like to talk to you and your husband

33:25.312 --> 33:26.536
about repairing the physical damage.

33:26.561 --> 33:27.958
- Of course.
- Thanks.

33:27.983 --> 33:29.516
Yes.

33:32.812 --> 33:35.054
He could've killed himself.

33:36.374 --> 33:38.392
Sometimes we get a win, right?

33:38.771 --> 33:40.975
Sometimes we get a win.

33:41.345 --> 33:44.689
<i>If you take one thing away from me today,</i>

33:44.714 --> 33:46.741
<i>let it be this:</i>

33:47.574 --> 33:51.642
<i>treat the patient, not the disease.</i>

34:20.812 --> 34:22.678
Good. You haven't started.

34:22.703 --> 34:24.937
Just finished the line. Why?

34:25.710 --> 34:28.795
You were right. We shouldn't do this.

34:29.331 --> 34:30.773
What changed your mind?

34:30.797 --> 34:33.321
Treat the patient, not the disease.

34:35.797 --> 34:38.578
Our patient wouldn't have wanted this.

34:39.272 --> 34:41.175
April, 10 milligrams of morphine,

34:41.199 --> 34:42.956
and hang a drip, please.

34:48.054 --> 34:49.920
Dr. Rowan...

34:50.815 --> 34:52.924
I'm going to extubate you.

34:53.751 --> 34:56.136
I promise you won't feel any pain.

34:59.498 --> 35:02.391
I'll let you two be alone with her now.

35:21.396 --> 35:24.464
[coughing]

35:53.907 --> 35:56.348
Okay,
going to start the carotid anastomosis.

35:56.373 --> 35:58.115
Everybody get ready.

35:58.232 --> 36:00.332
We're going to clamp the left carotid.

36:00.357 --> 36:03.239
Carla,
tell me if you see any change on the EEG.

36:03.264 --> 36:04.746
Right.

36:05.282 --> 36:07.911
Peripheral cross clamp times two?

36:23.368 --> 36:26.386
- Carotid is cross-clamped.
- Brain waves look good.

36:26.864 --> 36:30.901
Okay, eleven blade,
followed by 5-0 prolene.

36:40.747 --> 36:43.243
Let's sew this graft in quickly.

36:44.128 --> 36:46.362
Brain waves flattening on the right.

36:46.387 --> 36:48.547
He's impending infarct.

36:49.723 --> 36:52.924
We only have four minutes of
hypoxia before deficits occur.

36:52.949 --> 36:54.428
Do we unclamp him?

36:54.453 --> 36:56.286
We can still call this off
and take him to the cath lab.

36:56.311 --> 36:58.216
It's safer.

36:58.638 --> 37:00.245
Dr. Rhodes...

37:00.270 --> 37:03.721
No. This kid's not losing his arm.

37:05.779 --> 37:07.345
Coming around the front wall now.

37:07.370 --> 37:09.737
Left side brain's 50, right side's 70.

37:09.762 --> 37:13.606
Dr. Bardovi, follow me. Eyes on the field.

37:14.282 --> 37:16.208
Dr. Rhodes,
you need to get those clamps off.

37:16.240 --> 37:18.571
Thank you, Marty, I'm almost there.

37:20.856 --> 37:23.657
Left side's 30, right side's 50.

37:26.952 --> 37:30.123
Okay, done.

37:30.148 --> 37:32.292
Coming off cross clamp.

37:33.369 --> 37:35.569
Cross clamps are off.

37:35.594 --> 37:37.761
I've reestablished flow.

37:39.553 --> 37:41.886
EEG is normalizing.

37:43.244 --> 37:45.555
You have a good wave pattern.

37:45.797 --> 37:47.677
He's good.

37:48.235 --> 37:49.802
Nice work, Dr. Rhodes.

37:49.875 --> 37:52.943
Okay, everyone,
let's get set up for the stent.

37:56.430 --> 37:57.929
- Good night.
- Good night.

37:57.954 --> 38:00.402
How could you do this to us?

38:00.778 --> 38:04.177
- Uh, excuse me?
- My husband told me.

38:04.856 --> 38:06.660
He'll lose his pilot's license.

38:06.685 --> 38:08.373
We'll lose everything.

38:08.398 --> 38:11.065
I'm very sorry. Uh, I had no choice.

38:11.090 --> 38:14.000
I am legally obligated to report him.

38:14.253 --> 38:16.096
It's his life.

38:24.941 --> 38:27.222
I called the FAA. I had to.

38:27.642 --> 38:31.010
Every time he gets on a plane,
he puts his own life

38:31.035 --> 38:33.474
and the lives of all of
his passengers at risk.

38:34.970 --> 38:37.169
I know this wasn't, um,

38:37.868 --> 38:40.263
necessarily the win that
you were looking for,

38:40.288 --> 38:43.446
but at least we saved a man's life.

38:44.383 --> 38:46.250
See you in the morning?

39:03.084 --> 39:05.472
I heard the surgery went well.

39:06.158 --> 39:07.862
Yeah, thankfully.

39:07.887 --> 39:09.853
[chuckles]

39:09.878 --> 39:12.417
Yeah, don't worry, I won't tell anyone.

39:12.774 --> 39:15.792
- Tell 'em what?
- Mm, that you were scared.

39:15.821 --> 39:17.503
Oh, that's what you think, huh?

39:17.528 --> 39:19.190
Yeah.

39:19.985 --> 39:23.861
[sighs] Man, you're definitely a Charles.

39:24.047 --> 39:26.463
- You're very perceptive.
- Hm.

39:29.032 --> 39:30.832
I was after that first time.

39:30.857 --> 39:31.990
I was... I was afraid.

39:32.015 --> 39:33.913
I was afraid I was gonna lose him.

39:34.429 --> 39:35.762
[soft exhale]

39:35.787 --> 39:38.839
I have fears of my own, you know.

39:39.254 --> 39:42.144
- Cholera? Typhus?
- [chuckles] Yeah.

39:42.169 --> 39:44.799
And relationships. [chuckles]

39:45.658 --> 39:48.612
There are a lot of pitfalls
in dating a surgeon.

39:48.785 --> 39:51.815
It's crazy hours, stress of the job...

39:51.840 --> 39:55.081
Great case, Dr. Rhodes. Very impressive.

39:55.309 --> 39:58.104
And thanks for the vote of confidence.

40:00.165 --> 40:03.371
Fawning women falling at your feet.

40:03.872 --> 40:06.205
Yeah, I don't know if I can
compete with all of that.

40:06.230 --> 40:07.401
[laughs]

40:07.706 --> 40:09.950
You don't have to compete.

40:10.450 --> 40:12.317
I'm all in.

40:18.957 --> 40:22.525
So your sister...

40:22.550 --> 40:24.756
[both laugh]

40:25.133 --> 40:28.326
Let's see,
is she a red or white wine drinker?

40:28.351 --> 40:30.351
Mm, white.

40:30.376 --> 40:33.222
Not Chardonnay. Uh, Sauvignon Blanc.

40:37.401 --> 40:40.506
- Will?
- [sniffles]

40:40.936 --> 40:42.648
Hey.

40:44.414 --> 40:49.118
I'm... I'm so sorry for your loss.

40:56.899 --> 40:59.999
[sobbing]
