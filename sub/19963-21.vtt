¶¶

00:03.604 --> 00:06.038
(theme song playing)

00:09.010 --> 00:12.311
<i> ¶ I got the wind in my hair</i>
<i> and a fire within ¶</i>

00:12.313 --> 00:14.380
<i> ¶ 'Cause there's</i>
<i> something beginning ¶</i>

00:14.382 --> 00:20.319
<i> ¶ I got a mystery to solve</i>
<i> and excitement to spare ¶</i>

00:20.321 --> 00:23.288
<i> ¶ That beautiful breeze</i>
<i> blowing through ¶</i>

00:23.290 --> 00:28.127
<i> ¶ I'm ready to follow it</i>
<i> who knows where ¶</i>

00:28.129 --> 00:30.829
<i> ¶ I'll get there, I swear ¶</i>

00:30.831 --> 00:37.036
<i> ¶ With the wind in my hair ¶</i>

00:45.212 --> 00:47.146
(chirping)

00:54.688 --> 00:58.123
(giggling)

01:07.601 --> 01:09.768
(grunting):
Move it to the left.

01:09.770 --> 01:11.770
Wait. Your left or mine?

01:11.772 --> 01:13.372
Mine. No, yours.

01:13.374 --> 01:14.840
No, wait a minute.
They're the same!

01:17.678 --> 01:19.278
-(Max neighs)
-(bell rings)

01:19.280 --> 01:21.013
(cheering)

01:21.015 --> 01:22.681
Man:
Way to go!

01:27.555 --> 01:28.987
(squeaks)

01:33.060 --> 01:34.359
-(knocking)
-Eugene: Princess?

01:34.361 --> 01:36.628
Happy birthday!

01:36.630 --> 01:38.263
(squeaks)

01:42.803 --> 01:44.136
How ya doing?

01:44.138 --> 01:46.071
How am I doing?

01:46.073 --> 01:47.940
Okay. Let's see, um...

01:47.942 --> 01:50.309
I found out my father's
been lying to me for months,

01:50.311 --> 01:53.112
a secret squad of guards
hunted us down
in the dead of night,

01:53.114 --> 01:54.580
oh, I destroyed
my childhood home,

01:54.582 --> 01:56.582
and most recently,
I committed treason

01:56.584 --> 01:58.717
while helping an extremely
unstable alchemist

01:58.719 --> 02:02.921
steal the most powerful object
in the seven kingdoms!

02:02.923 --> 02:04.623
But enough about me.
Let's talk about you.

02:04.625 --> 02:06.024
How are you doing?

02:10.297 --> 02:12.297
(sighs)

02:12.299 --> 02:13.332
Sorry.

02:13.334 --> 02:14.766
No. No, it's okay.

02:14.768 --> 02:17.903
But hey, I know
what will cheer you up.

02:21.575 --> 02:23.909
Presents Room!
(laughing)

02:23.911 --> 02:25.310
Rapunzel:
Goodness!

02:25.312 --> 02:26.945
These are all for me?

02:26.947 --> 02:28.313
The people love you!

02:28.315 --> 02:29.748
Oh, I am so good at this.

02:29.750 --> 02:31.083
-Look, look!
-(box rattles)

02:31.085 --> 02:32.417
It's a set
of paintbrushes.

02:32.419 --> 02:34.953
-(box clinks)
-Someone got a new necklace.

02:34.955 --> 02:37.289
-And this is...
-(clattering)

02:37.291 --> 02:40.058
...clearly something
that probably shouldn't
have been shaken.

02:43.330 --> 02:45.364
Oh, that one next?

02:45.366 --> 02:47.533
(fabric rustling)

02:47.534 --> 02:49.701
Come on, socks?
She doesn't even
wear shoes, people!

02:53.474 --> 02:54.840
"Wind Me"?

02:55.943 --> 02:57.709
(tinkling ominously)

03:01.615 --> 03:03.448
Kinda creepy.

03:03.450 --> 03:05.050
Oh, hi!

03:05.052 --> 03:06.618
Oh!

03:06.620 --> 03:07.819
Friedborg!

03:07.821 --> 03:09.855
You startled me.

03:09.857 --> 03:11.456
Wait, is it time
for my fitting?

03:11.458 --> 03:12.791
Where's Cassandra?

03:12.793 --> 03:14.393
I haven't seen her all day.

03:14.395 --> 03:16.795
See? Things aren't
so bad after all.

03:18.065 --> 03:20.399
No. Come on.
We should find her.

03:21.802 --> 03:24.503
Friedborg, keep up the...

03:24.505 --> 03:25.604
(clears throat)

03:27.841 --> 03:29.408
Keep it up.

03:34.515 --> 03:37.082
-(birds chirping)
-(girls giggling)

03:39.486 --> 03:40.485
(gasps)

03:40.487 --> 03:43.388
-(rumbling)
-(all gasp)

03:45.159 --> 03:47.092
-(screaming)
-Girl: Run!

03:49.897 --> 03:53.098
(grunting)

03:53.100 --> 03:55.334
Cass? What are you doing?

03:55.336 --> 03:56.602
Haven't you heard?

03:56.604 --> 03:59.338
This is my new assignment. Oof!

03:59.340 --> 04:01.273
What are you talking about?

04:01.275 --> 04:03.308
Seems like your dad
found out I was the one

04:03.310 --> 04:05.911
who snuck you out of Corona
before your coronation.

04:05.913 --> 04:08.180
And, well...

04:08.182 --> 04:10.549
(groans)
...here we are.

04:10.551 --> 04:12.084
That's impossible!

04:12.086 --> 04:13.552
How would he even know?

04:13.554 --> 04:17.356
The only possible way
he could have found out is if--

04:17.358 --> 04:19.791
He read my journal.

04:21.095 --> 04:22.628
(sighs) Okay.

04:22.630 --> 04:25.631
Don't worry, Cass.
I am going to get
you out of this.

04:25.633 --> 04:27.766
Hey, but in the meantime...

04:27.768 --> 04:30.369
at least you have
stable employment.

04:30.371 --> 04:33.105
(laughs)

04:33.107 --> 04:34.473
Okay, not--
not great timing,

04:34.475 --> 04:37.242
but different room,
different circumstances,
that would've killed!

04:37.244 --> 04:38.744
Don't waste your time, Raps.

04:38.746 --> 04:40.512
This is just temporary.

04:41.582 --> 04:43.715
I'm being sent
to a convent tomorrow.

04:47.488 --> 04:49.154
(metal creaks)

04:49.156 --> 04:51.356
(tinkling ominously)

04:55.496 --> 04:57.429
(thudding)

04:57.431 --> 05:00.565
-(metallic whirring)
-(music continues)

05:07.841 --> 05:09.541
(thudding)

05:10.811 --> 05:13.512
(powering up)

05:13.514 --> 05:15.514
My dad has gone too far.

05:15.516 --> 05:17.849
You shouldn't be punished
for something I--

05:17.851 --> 05:19.518
-(crashing)
-(Rapunzel yelps)

05:21.021 --> 05:22.321
Friend of yours?

05:22.323 --> 05:23.588
An automaton?

05:23.590 --> 05:25.090
Varian and I fought one like--

05:25.092 --> 05:26.458
Varian.

05:26.460 --> 05:28.327
How did it get past the guards?

05:28.329 --> 05:29.461
Eugene:
That's a good question,

05:29.463 --> 05:30.862
but I'm guessing
it's not here for the party.

05:30.864 --> 05:32.497
(shouts)

05:32.499 --> 05:33.999
Eugene, wait, wait, wait, wait!

05:34.001 --> 05:35.801
-He's incredibly--
-(metal thuds)

05:35.803 --> 05:37.102
(groans)

05:37.104 --> 05:38.437
Strong.

05:38.439 --> 05:40.706
Nope, got it.
No need to finish
that thought.

05:40.708 --> 05:42.341
-(thuds)
-(Eugene grunts)

05:46.613 --> 05:48.280
-(ratcheting)
-Cass!

05:53.620 --> 05:56.088
-Pascal, the banner.
-(squeaks)

06:00.327 --> 06:01.660
Hey, Tick-Tock!

06:01.662 --> 06:03.595
Over here!

06:06.834 --> 06:08.934
No, no! This way!

06:09.870 --> 06:10.969
Come get it!

06:12.473 --> 06:13.905
Cass!

06:16.510 --> 06:18.176
Wait, wait, wait!

06:18.178 --> 06:19.311
No, step this way!

06:22.049 --> 06:23.415
(gasps)

06:29.323 --> 06:31.490
(metal grinding)

06:31.492 --> 06:33.091
(powering down)

06:33.093 --> 06:34.493
(shuddering)

06:34.495 --> 06:36.294
(whines down)

06:37.498 --> 06:39.097
(grinding)

06:39.099 --> 06:40.165
(sighs)

06:41.335 --> 06:43.502
-And push.
-(all straining)

06:43.504 --> 06:45.103
Eugene:
Heads up.

06:45.105 --> 06:46.505
(whistling)

06:48.041 --> 06:50.175
-(crashing)
-(bell ringing)

06:50.177 --> 06:52.944
Congratulations.

06:52.946 --> 06:56.581
You win a magical fish.

06:56.583 --> 06:58.750
(belches)
Oh, that's right.

06:58.752 --> 07:01.486
I forgot I ate the magical fish.

07:02.689 --> 07:05.290
-(Pascal squeaking)
-(Rapunzel grunts)

07:05.292 --> 07:07.025
Captain:
Our first priority

07:07.027 --> 07:10.028
is getting to bottom
of who was responsible
for this attack.

07:12.699 --> 07:15.200
There's no question
who's behind it.

07:15.202 --> 07:16.701
The question is...

07:16.703 --> 07:17.903
what was Varian after?

07:17.905 --> 07:19.871
That boy is dangerous.

07:19.873 --> 07:22.107
And I assure you,
he will pay dearly.

07:22.109 --> 07:25.043
Listen, Dad,
he is up to something.

07:25.045 --> 07:27.746
-And we need to get
to the bottom--
-We needn't do anything.

07:27.748 --> 07:30.115
The situation is being
handled, Rapunzel.

07:30.117 --> 07:33.418
You can see how
I might have a little trouble
taking you at your word...

07:33.420 --> 07:34.553
Your Majesty.

07:34.555 --> 07:35.754
Rapunzel.

07:35.756 --> 07:39.057
I know these past days
have been strained,

07:39.059 --> 07:40.325
to say the least,

07:40.327 --> 07:42.828
but more important than
any of our disagreements,

07:42.830 --> 07:45.564
more important
than anything at all,

07:45.566 --> 07:47.399
is your safety.

07:47.401 --> 07:49.501
So in light of this
vicious assault,

07:49.503 --> 07:52.604
it is with heavy heart
that I make this decision.

07:52.606 --> 07:55.774
Until the threat of Varian
has been neutralized,

07:55.776 --> 07:58.243
you are to remain
under constant surveillance

07:58.245 --> 08:00.579
in the most secure room
in the castle.

08:00.581 --> 08:02.647
(gasps)

08:13.994 --> 08:15.694
Eugene:
How is what you're
doing to Rapunzel

08:15.696 --> 08:17.496
any different than
what was done to her

08:17.498 --> 08:19.498
for the first 18 years
of her life?

08:19.500 --> 08:21.366
Remember yourself,
Fitzherbert.

08:21.368 --> 08:23.101
-You are--
-Nigel.

08:23.103 --> 08:24.603
Eugene, son,

08:24.605 --> 08:28.540
I realize how this
situation might appear,

08:28.542 --> 08:32.477
but you must trust
that I have no choice.

08:32.479 --> 08:34.613
What?! Of course,
you have a choice!

08:34.615 --> 08:37.716
You're the king!
You cannot keep her up there!

08:37.718 --> 08:41.753
I'll do whatever I must
to keep Rapunzel safe from harm.

08:43.557 --> 08:44.956
(whispers)
And so will I.

08:49.630 --> 08:50.662
(chitters)

08:50.664 --> 08:52.731
(squeaks)

08:53.734 --> 08:55.300
(squeaks)

08:55.302 --> 08:56.701
(door opens)

08:58.238 --> 08:59.571
(sighs) Mom!

09:00.507 --> 09:01.806
I'm so sorry.

09:01.808 --> 09:03.041
I tried to talk him out of it,

09:03.043 --> 09:06.511
but you know your father
can be immovable.

09:06.513 --> 09:08.880
What is Dad so afraid of?

09:08.882 --> 09:10.849
Why is he doing this to me?

09:10.851 --> 09:12.918
Rapunzel, in the two decades
you were gone,

09:12.920 --> 09:15.820
not once did your father
sleep through the night.

09:15.822 --> 09:19.190
Your absence haunted him
every minute of every day.

09:19.192 --> 09:21.826
Are you saying
that makes this right?

09:21.828 --> 09:23.395
I'm asking you to consider

09:23.397 --> 09:26.998
that despite how
rash and drastic
his actions may seem,

09:27.000 --> 09:29.401
or how much
you disagree with them,

09:29.403 --> 09:31.069
they come from a place of love.

09:33.273 --> 09:34.839
But I agree with you.

09:35.909 --> 09:37.576
This isn't right.

09:37.578 --> 09:39.311
(snoring)

09:41.048 --> 09:42.681
-(crashing)
-(gasping)

09:42.683 --> 09:44.716
-(rumbling)
-(exclaims)

09:44.718 --> 09:46.618
(exclaiming)

09:46.620 --> 09:49.955
Oh, sugar!
The king must be told!

09:49.957 --> 09:53.358
Oh! Oh, oh, oh!
We have to tell the king!

09:53.360 --> 09:55.760
Don't look at me.
I'm on my lunch.

09:56.730 --> 09:57.929
(hoots)

09:57.931 --> 10:00.966
You should know
the decision to send you off

10:00.968 --> 10:02.767
brings me no pleasure.

10:02.769 --> 10:05.370
Perhaps after this threat
has been quelled,

10:05.372 --> 10:06.738
and some time has passed,

10:06.740 --> 10:10.141
we can revisit
the arrangement.

10:10.143 --> 10:12.310
(hooting)

10:12.312 --> 10:14.813
Until then, of course...

10:14.815 --> 10:16.715
I'll come to see you when I can.

10:18.251 --> 10:20.819
Dad, all I ever wanted
was to be like you.

10:20.821 --> 10:22.287
I wanted to be a royal guard,

10:22.289 --> 10:23.989
and serve my kingdom.

10:23.991 --> 10:26.625
I-I-I wanted
to make you proud.

10:26.627 --> 10:28.126
-Honey...
-There was a time in my life

10:28.128 --> 10:29.928
where I would
have done anything,

10:29.930 --> 10:33.131
gone to any lengths
to keep from disappointing you.

10:33.133 --> 10:35.100
-(hoots)
-The last thing
I ever expected

10:35.102 --> 10:38.470
was for you to be the one
to disappoint me.

10:39.840 --> 10:42.540
-(hoots sadly)
-(groans)

10:43.777 --> 10:46.044
¶ ¶

10:53.453 --> 10:56.187
¶ Locked inside a tower ¶

10:56.189 --> 10:58.690
¶ Kept behind a wall ¶

10:58.692 --> 11:02.160
¶ Sheltered from a world
you've barely known ¶

11:03.196 --> 11:05.797
¶ That's the way
they treat you ¶

11:05.799 --> 11:07.799
¶ And what's worst of all ¶

11:07.801 --> 11:09.034
¶ Who's to blame ¶

11:09.036 --> 11:12.871
¶ Just you and you alone ¶

11:12.873 --> 11:14.773
¶ There's much more
inside of you ¶

11:14.775 --> 11:16.941
¶ Than anyone can see ¶

11:16.943 --> 11:19.010
¶ And now the choice is yours ¶

11:19.012 --> 11:21.312
¶ Life waits beyond the doors ¶

11:21.314 --> 11:23.348
<i> ¶ So step on through,</i>
<i> the time has come ¶</i>

11:23.350 --> 11:27.052
<i> ¶ And only you</i>
<i> can set yourself free ¶</i>

11:29.456 --> 11:32.457
¶ No one else can
tell you what to do ¶

11:32.459 --> 11:35.727
¶ Or who to be ¶

11:37.664 --> 11:41.366
¶ No one gets to say
if you will stay or go ¶

11:41.368 --> 11:43.735
<i> ¶ So use the gifts</i>
<i> you're given ¶</i>

11:43.737 --> 11:45.970
<i> ¶ Make the world your own ¶</i>

11:45.972 --> 11:49.874
¶ Look inside your heart
and find the key ¶

11:50.811 --> 11:54.813
<i> ¶ And set yourself free ¶</i>

11:55.749 --> 11:58.016
¶ Bound up by your worries ¶

11:58.018 --> 11:59.818
¶ Trapped by your mistakes ¶

11:59.820 --> 12:03.788
¶ Forced to play a role
you never chose ¶

12:03.790 --> 12:06.024
¶ Why not test your limits ¶

12:06.026 --> 12:07.892
<i> ¶ You've got what it takes ¶</i>

12:07.894 --> 12:11.863
<i> ¶ Let it out and follow</i>
<i> where it goes ¶</i>

12:11.865 --> 12:15.867
<i> ¶ No more letting someone else</i>
<i> define you to a "T" ¶</i>

12:15.869 --> 12:17.902
¶ You know that you are strong ¶

12:17.904 --> 12:19.871
¶ You've known it all along ¶

12:19.873 --> 12:21.873
¶ So seize the day,
let down your hair ¶

12:21.875 --> 12:26.111
¶ You'll find a way
to set yourself free ¶

12:27.914 --> 12:30.882
¶ Now it's up to you
and what you'll do ¶

12:30.884 --> 12:36.054
¶ And who you'll be ¶

12:36.056 --> 12:39.424
¶ You get to decide
how far and wide you'll go ¶

12:39.426 --> 12:41.926
¶ So look to the horizon ¶

12:41.928 --> 12:43.895
¶ Open up your wings ¶

12:43.897 --> 12:48.733
¶ Fly away to find
your destiny ¶

12:48.735 --> 12:54.906
¶ And set yourself free ¶

12:54.908 --> 12:58.042
(panting)

12:58.044 --> 13:00.278
-Pascal?
-(squeaks)

13:02.082 --> 13:03.848
We're getting out of here.

13:15.262 --> 13:16.961
(Pascal squeaking)

13:18.165 --> 13:19.564
(squeaks)

13:25.839 --> 13:26.905
(owl hoots)

13:26.907 --> 13:28.807
Eugene:
Uh... (chuckles)
quick question.

13:28.809 --> 13:32.010
I'm not sure that I see the part
of Rapunzel's escape plan

13:32.012 --> 13:34.779
that specifically says
I have to be the one

13:34.781 --> 13:36.648
who gets launched
from a catapult.

13:36.650 --> 13:38.917
Keep lookin', fly boy.
It's there.

13:38.919 --> 13:40.285
I'm sorry.
Weren't you supposed to be

13:40.287 --> 13:41.986
halfway to a convent by now?

13:41.988 --> 13:43.955
Yeah. Just my luck.

13:43.957 --> 13:45.757
Must've taken
a wrong turn somewhere.

13:47.093 --> 13:48.459
Oh, okay. Whoa.

13:48.461 --> 13:50.328
(grunting)

13:50.330 --> 13:52.096
Present delivery
for the princess!

13:52.098 --> 13:54.699
Sorry. No one
goes in or out.

13:54.701 --> 13:55.967
Lance, I know what
you're trying to do.

13:55.969 --> 13:57.202
Frankly, I don't blame you.

13:57.204 --> 13:59.103
We don't wanna see
the princess locked up either.

13:59.105 --> 14:00.371
(gasps)

14:00.373 --> 14:01.673
Wait!

14:01.675 --> 14:04.142
Are you insinuating
that I am trying

14:04.144 --> 14:05.777
to break the princess out?

14:05.779 --> 14:09.013
Well! I'm just embarrassed
for both of you.

14:09.015 --> 14:11.015
Well, Stan said it, so...

14:11.017 --> 14:14.953
I assure you, there's nothing
but gifts in these packages.

14:16.356 --> 14:18.122
Have a look.

14:31.171 --> 14:33.471
(gasps)
An accordion?

14:33.473 --> 14:36.140
I have always wanted
to play one of these.

14:36.142 --> 14:38.476
Well, what's stopping ya?

14:38.478 --> 14:41.079
-Stan, wasn't I just saying--
-He was just saying that.

14:41.081 --> 14:42.146
I was just saying--

14:42.148 --> 14:44.816
We want to start a band
called "The En Gardes."

14:44.818 --> 14:45.984
You know? Do you get that?

14:54.094 --> 14:55.827
That's our signal.

14:57.230 --> 14:58.763
Ha! I knew it!

14:58.765 --> 15:01.032
There's nothing here
that says I have to--

15:01.034 --> 15:03.001
-Oop! My mistake!
-Wait! No!

15:03.970 --> 15:05.603
(Eugene screaming)

15:05.605 --> 15:06.905
Man, that felt good.

15:08.275 --> 15:10.975
-(screaming)
-(thuds)

15:16.283 --> 15:18.449
-Are you ready?
-Nope. Not in any way.

15:18.451 --> 15:19.651
I'll take that as a yes.

15:27.394 --> 15:30.161
I am not loving this plan!

15:32.098 --> 15:34.032
-(accordion playing off-key)
-(coughing)

15:34.034 --> 15:36.434
You sure you haven't
accordion-ed before?

15:36.436 --> 15:38.636
(laughs)
Right?

15:38.638 --> 15:40.271
It's just coming out of me!

15:43.076 --> 15:44.392
Sounds great, Pete!

15:44.393 --> 15:45.709
(strained)
That was a lot more painful
than I expected.

15:45.712 --> 15:48.246
(both groaning)

15:48.248 --> 15:50.014
-Hook?
-Hook.

15:55.288 --> 15:56.988
(Max chuffs)

16:01.061 --> 16:03.227
(cracking)

16:03.229 --> 16:05.797
Seriously? This is the whole
reason you needed me?

16:05.799 --> 16:07.899
Couldn't you have
just used a regular hook?

16:09.602 --> 16:11.502
Um, possibly,

16:11.504 --> 16:13.304
but probably best
not to overthink it.

16:16.242 --> 16:19.277
(screams)

16:19.279 --> 16:21.145
Wait, did you hear something?

16:21.147 --> 16:23.181
Only musical genius!
(laughing)

16:23.183 --> 16:25.083
I got him, I got him.

16:27.120 --> 16:29.320
(toys squeaking)

16:29.322 --> 16:30.455
I got him.

16:30.457 --> 16:32.523
I'm the winner!

16:32.525 --> 16:35.460
-(thudding)
-(crashing)

16:35.462 --> 16:37.095
Hey, Blondie.

16:37.097 --> 16:38.963
(gasps)
Eugene!

16:38.965 --> 16:40.832
I've come to rescue you
from a tower...

16:40.834 --> 16:42.233
again.

16:50.276 --> 16:52.276
-You ready?
-(squeaks)

17:00.787 --> 17:02.320
Thanks, guys!

17:02.322 --> 17:05.857
Well, listening to Pete
play for that long wasn't easy,

17:05.859 --> 17:07.725
but, uh, ha!

17:07.727 --> 17:09.127
I took one for the team.

17:09.129 --> 17:11.129
Oh, man.
That sounds really rough.

17:11.131 --> 17:13.498
I feel sorry for you.
By the way...

17:13.500 --> 17:15.466
(shouting)
I fell out of a tower!

17:15.468 --> 17:18.870
Okay, everyone, I'm not sure
what Varian is planning,

17:18.872 --> 17:20.738
-but we really have to--
-(squeaks)

17:27.881 --> 17:29.247
(squeaks)

17:30.250 --> 17:33.251
(coughing)

17:33.253 --> 17:34.919
What is this?

17:34.921 --> 17:36.320
I do beg your pardon.

17:36.322 --> 17:38.689
I must be
magical-fish intolerant.

17:38.691 --> 17:40.892
-Varian (amplified):
<i> Hello, Corona.</i>
-It's Varian.

17:40.894 --> 17:42.326
Where is his voice
coming from?

17:42.328 --> 17:44.729
Varian:
<i> Something dark</i>
<i> is coming for you.</i>

17:44.731 --> 17:47.198
<i> Our king has refused</i>
<i> to acknowledge it.</i>

17:47.200 --> 17:49.000
<i> In the hopes of keeping</i>
<i> his secret,</i>

17:49.002 --> 17:53.004
<i> he has lied to you</i>
<i> and vilified me.</i>

17:53.006 --> 17:54.906
Captain! Get more men!

17:54.908 --> 17:58.242
On it, sir. Three details
from the West Hall
are on their way.

17:58.244 --> 18:00.344
Varian:
<i> In a matter of days, Corona,</i>

18:00.346 --> 18:02.280
<i> this island,</i>
<i> and the castle itself,</i>

18:02.282 --> 18:04.515
<i> will be overcome</i>
<i> by this growth.</i>

18:04.517 --> 18:07.218
<i> It has already taken over</i>
<i> the outskirts of the kingdom.</i>

18:07.220 --> 18:11.055
<i> The key to stopping</i>
<i> this destruction</i>

18:11.057 --> 18:14.392
<i> is Princess Rapunzel herself.</i>

18:14.394 --> 18:17.395
<i> I have asked for help</i>
<i> and have been ignored.</i>

18:17.397 --> 18:20.631
<i> I will not be ignored</i>
<i> any longer.</i>

18:20.633 --> 18:23.267
<i> And to make sure</i>
<i> I have your attention,</i>

18:23.269 --> 18:25.236
<i> I've developed a new serum,</i>

18:25.238 --> 18:28.873
<i> and created something</i>
<i> special for you all.</i>

18:30.110 --> 18:32.276
(low growling)

18:32.278 --> 18:34.812
Uh, guys?

18:34.814 --> 18:37.882
There's something in the fog.

18:39.119 --> 18:40.885
(low growling)

18:45.792 --> 18:47.391
(snarls)

18:47.393 --> 18:48.459
(nickers)

18:50.430 --> 18:52.230
(growling)

18:54.567 --> 18:55.967
-(snarling)
-Whoa!

18:57.070 --> 18:58.836
(stammering)
What is that?

18:59.806 --> 19:01.239
-(snarling)
-(guard exclaims)

19:01.241 --> 19:03.274
Well, whatever it is,
it's fast.

19:03.276 --> 19:06.043
-Watch out!
-What? Rapunzel?

19:07.480 --> 19:08.713
(snarling)

19:09.649 --> 19:11.849
Find the princess!
Get her to safety!

19:11.851 --> 19:13.518
You heard him, men!

19:13.520 --> 19:14.785
-Get the--
-(growls)

19:14.787 --> 19:15.920
(roaring)

19:18.024 --> 19:19.690
-Dad!
-(growls)

19:19.692 --> 19:21.792
(roars)

19:21.794 --> 19:25.563
Oh, I liked it so much better
when it was invisible!

19:28.134 --> 19:30.034
Cassandra, listen.

19:30.036 --> 19:32.170
(groans)
About earlier, I...

19:32.172 --> 19:33.804
Dad, I want you to know

19:33.806 --> 19:36.073
that I've never been
disappointed in you.

19:37.010 --> 19:38.409
I'm sorry.

19:42.048 --> 19:44.482
Sit tight, soldier.
I got this.

19:44.484 --> 19:47.385
Give me four men
covering the south gate,
four at the north.

19:47.387 --> 19:49.053
Nothing in, nothing out.

19:49.055 --> 19:50.555
Containment, people.

19:52.292 --> 19:54.192
It's like he's playing
hide-and-seek.

19:56.462 --> 19:58.996
Rapunzel:
Then he just picked
the wrong game.

19:58.998 --> 20:01.065
I think I've got an idea.

20:01.067 --> 20:03.334
-Max?
-(whinnies)

20:03.336 --> 20:05.469
You're on.

20:05.471 --> 20:07.071
(chuffs)

20:07.073 --> 20:09.740
Frederic:
Captain! Get more men!

20:11.678 --> 20:13.611
-Hello, Your Majesty.
-(gasps)

20:14.681 --> 20:16.480
Sleep.

20:29.729 --> 20:31.295
(roars)

20:33.733 --> 20:36.567
Pete, Stan,
drive him to the right.

20:37.503 --> 20:40.004
-Your right or my--
-This way, Pete.

20:46.713 --> 20:48.379
Hook Foot, Lance, now!

20:48.381 --> 20:49.647
(snarls)

20:56.623 --> 20:58.089
(growls)

21:01.394 --> 21:02.760
Trampoline!

21:15.742 --> 21:17.308
(growling)

21:18.878 --> 21:20.945
-What is-- (yelps)
-(roars)

21:23.449 --> 21:25.182
-(mock growling)
-(whimpering)

21:26.452 --> 21:28.886
Why would Varian
do something like this?

21:30.556 --> 21:31.856
What's happening?

21:35.061 --> 21:36.394
(chitters)

21:36.396 --> 21:38.996
-That's Rudiger!
-Varian's raccoon.

21:43.403 --> 21:45.303
(neighs)

21:45.305 --> 21:47.605
Rapunzel! You did it!

21:47.607 --> 21:49.340
(all cheering)

21:53.479 --> 21:56.447
Princess Rapunzel,
King Frederic.

21:56.449 --> 21:58.316
It's the queen.

21:58.318 --> 21:59.417
She's gone.

22:03.589 --> 22:04.989
Varian.

22:12.465 --> 22:13.764
Dad.

22:13.766 --> 22:16.467
Varian must be hiding
in Old Corona.

22:16.469 --> 22:18.502
I shall launch
a full-scale attack.

22:18.504 --> 22:21.339
Sir, we got hit pretty hard.

22:21.341 --> 22:23.040
Everyone's gonna be okay,

22:23.042 --> 22:26.210
but we won't be launching
a full-scale anything
for some time.

22:26.212 --> 22:28.045
(shouting)
Then we'll hit him
with whatever we have!

22:28.047 --> 22:31.816
Dad! You can't beat Varian
with swords and fists.

22:31.818 --> 22:34.552
So far, we've played
right into his hands.

22:34.554 --> 22:37.488
You know he never
meant to capture me!

22:37.490 --> 22:41.025
He-- he sent that automaton
to make you think
that was his plan.

22:41.027 --> 22:43.728
And then he used his monster

22:43.730 --> 22:46.564
to pull security away
from his real target.

22:46.566 --> 22:48.065
Mom.

22:50.336 --> 22:54.638
So, whatever you think
you're gonna throw at him,
he'll be waiting.

22:58.811 --> 23:01.912
We attack Old Corona
within the hour.

23:05.051 --> 23:06.751
(grunting)

23:06.753 --> 23:08.686
Varian:
Don't worry, Your Majesty.

23:08.688 --> 23:11.956
You are merely bait
to lure the princess here.

23:13.393 --> 23:15.760
Only the magic of her
unbreakable hair

23:15.762 --> 23:18.262
can shatter the amber
and free my father.

23:18.264 --> 23:21.031
I tried asking for help
in a civil manner,

23:21.033 --> 23:23.901
but was denied
by everyone in Corona.

23:23.903 --> 23:29.073
So, unfortunately, this is
my only remaining recourse.

23:30.843 --> 23:32.143
(gasps)

23:33.346 --> 23:36.614
Oh! And after you've
freed your father?

23:36.616 --> 23:38.249
After?

23:38.251 --> 23:40.184
Oh, well, I'm afraid
Corona will pay

23:40.186 --> 23:41.886
for turning their backs on me.

23:41.888 --> 23:45.689
And that's when you
should start worrying,
Your Majesty.

23:53.633 --> 23:56.200
And now I have
failed you too, Arianna.

23:58.237 --> 23:59.537
Dad?

23:59.539 --> 24:01.539
-(sniffles)
-Rapunzel.

24:01.541 --> 24:03.674
I thought I made it clear--

24:06.312 --> 24:07.611
(whispers)
Thank you.

24:07.613 --> 24:09.246
She's gonna be okay, Dad.

24:09.248 --> 24:10.748
We'll get her back.

24:10.750 --> 24:14.418
This... this is all my fault.

24:14.420 --> 24:15.719
Dad, no.

24:15.721 --> 24:19.223
No, it's Varian
and those rocks, and--

24:19.225 --> 24:21.325
No. No, Rapunzel.

24:21.327 --> 24:23.127
You were right.

24:23.129 --> 24:25.496
I have been keeping
something from you.

24:26.632 --> 24:29.166
<i> As you know,</i>
<i> the night you were born,</i>

24:29.168 --> 24:31.001
<i> your mother fell deathly ill.</i>

24:32.772 --> 24:35.673
<i> I was desperate to do</i>
<i> anything to save her,</i>

24:35.675 --> 24:38.126
<i> and you.</i>

24:38.127 --> 24:40.578
<i> So I sought out the miracle</i>
<i> of the Sun Drop Flower.</i>

24:40.580 --> 24:42.446
<i> But what I've never</i>
<i> told anyone</i>

24:42.448 --> 24:45.149
<i> was that there was more</i>
<i> to the story.</i>

24:45.151 --> 24:47.418
<i> You see, earlier that night,</i>

24:47.420 --> 24:49.620
<i> I was warned.</i>

24:49.622 --> 24:51.622
<i>Warned that taking the Sun Drop</i>

24:51.624 --> 24:54.124
<i> would reap</i>
<i> unimaginable consequences.</i>

24:54.126 --> 24:57.328
<i> That by removing the light...</i>

24:57.330 --> 24:59.763
<i> I'd be awakening a darkness.</i>

25:00.600 --> 25:02.666
<i> But I had no choice.</i>

25:10.042 --> 25:13.844
<i> I've known about these</i>
<i> black rocks all along.</i>

25:13.846 --> 25:15.646
At first, I didn't
want to believe

25:15.648 --> 25:17.715
that they were
the result of my actions.

25:18.651 --> 25:21.051
And when that
became impossible,

25:21.053 --> 25:22.520
I chose to ignore them.

25:22.522 --> 25:24.788
And I expected everyone else
to do the same.

25:25.725 --> 25:26.824
Including me.

25:26.826 --> 25:29.727
Yes, yes. Especially you.

25:29.729 --> 25:31.629
But the truth is,

25:31.631 --> 25:33.731
the rocks are destroying Corona.

25:33.733 --> 25:35.065
And you...

25:35.067 --> 25:37.134
you are connected
to them somehow.

25:37.136 --> 25:39.803
And I am responsible.

25:39.805 --> 25:44.775
No king would ever put
the welfare of his family
before that of his country.

25:48.314 --> 25:50.648
But a father would.

25:54.320 --> 25:58.122
Now, let's find a way
to save our kingdom.

26:02.495 --> 26:04.028
The rocks are getting closer!

26:04.030 --> 26:06.363
Oh! Oh, we're doomed!

26:06.365 --> 26:09.233
-Doomed!
-Pipe down, Feldspar.

26:09.235 --> 26:12.069
No one can hear me.

26:12.071 --> 26:14.004
(low, gravelly voice)
We're doomed, I tell you.

26:14.006 --> 26:15.272
-People!
-(indistinct shouting)

26:15.274 --> 26:17.508
Citizens, please, listen to me!

26:17.510 --> 26:21.879
(loud whinnying, neighing)

26:21.881 --> 26:24.014
I will not lie
to you any longer.

26:24.016 --> 26:26.383
Corona is in grave danger.

26:26.385 --> 26:28.185
The queen has been taken.

26:28.187 --> 26:31.188
Over half our royal guard
lie wounded.

26:31.190 --> 26:34.792
-And these black rocks
draw ever closer.
-(indistinct shouting)

26:34.794 --> 26:35.893
Uh, sir, hi, yeah.

26:35.895 --> 26:37.194
If there's a "but"
in this speech,

26:37.196 --> 26:39.697
you probably want
to cut to it right now.

26:39.699 --> 26:42.900
But I look at you,
and I don't just see subjects,

26:42.902 --> 26:44.268
I see friends,

26:44.270 --> 26:45.603
family,

26:45.605 --> 26:49.239
strong, brave individuals who
have stood by each others' side,

26:49.241 --> 26:51.642
and have never, ever
backed down from a fight.

26:51.644 --> 26:54.411
Today, we face a danger
like none before.

26:54.413 --> 26:58.148
As your king, your friend,
and as your brother,

26:58.150 --> 27:01.051
I ask you to fight
one more time.

27:01.053 --> 27:02.319
For Corona!

27:02.321 --> 27:05.823
Crowd (chanting):
For Corona! For Corona!

27:07.059 --> 27:09.827
What do you ask of us,
Your Majesty?

27:09.829 --> 27:13.163
As was so insightfully
pointed out to me,

27:13.165 --> 27:15.432
we've been playing
straight into Varian's hands,

27:15.434 --> 27:18.969
and now, he's expecting
a full-out attack on Old Corona.

27:18.971 --> 27:20.738
So, what's the plan,
Your Majesty?

27:22.408 --> 27:24.942
We launch a full-out
attack on Old Corona.

27:24.944 --> 27:27.444
But we'd be giving him
the upper hand.

27:27.446 --> 27:29.013
Yeah, well,
we're gonna let Varian

27:29.015 --> 27:31.015
think he still has
the upper hand.

27:31.017 --> 27:33.150
And while we distract him
with the assault,

27:33.152 --> 27:34.752
I am gonna sneak
around the back,

27:34.754 --> 27:37.755
using the underground tunnels,
and rescue the queen.

27:39.825 --> 27:43.227
We are going
to rescue the queen.

27:44.296 --> 27:46.030
With all due respect, Princess,

27:46.032 --> 27:48.032
Varian only wants you.

27:48.034 --> 27:49.533
Once he sees
you're nowhere to be found,

27:49.535 --> 27:51.602
won't he realize that
our attack is just a diversion?

27:51.604 --> 27:55.072
Probably. That is
what he is for.

27:56.776 --> 27:58.108
I got this.

28:00.646 --> 28:02.112
Ready, Caspal?

28:02.114 --> 28:03.781
(imitating squeaking)

28:04.817 --> 28:07.117
¶ ¶

28:09.689 --> 28:12.956
Varian:
Any moment now,
Your Highness.

28:12.958 --> 28:15.693
¶ Believe me, I know ¶

28:15.695 --> 28:17.828
¶ I've sunk pretty low ¶

28:17.830 --> 28:20.864
¶ But whatever I've done,
you've deserved ¶

28:20.866 --> 28:22.199
-Varian.
-Quiet!

28:22.201 --> 28:24.301
¶ I'm the bad guy, that's fine ¶

28:24.303 --> 28:26.170
¶ It's no fault of mine ¶

28:26.172 --> 28:29.573
¶ And some justice
at last will be served ¶

28:29.575 --> 28:30.841
Please listen!

28:30.843 --> 28:32.810
¶ Now it's time to step up ¶

28:32.812 --> 28:34.978
¶ Or it's time to back down ¶

28:34.980 --> 28:39.216
¶ And there's only
one answer for me ¶

28:39.218 --> 28:41.418
¶ And I'll stand up and fight ¶

28:41.420 --> 28:43.921
¶ 'Cause I know that I'm right ¶

28:43.923 --> 28:48.992
¶ And I'm ready,
I'm ready, I'm ready ¶

28:48.994 --> 28:53.931
¶ Ready as I'll ever be ¶

28:56.202 --> 28:58.168
(groaning)

28:58.170 --> 29:00.270
Cap, are you sure
you're up for this?

29:00.272 --> 29:02.740
Actually, I don't think I am.

29:02.742 --> 29:04.074
I'll only slow you down.

29:04.076 --> 29:06.844
But how are you
gonna lead the assault?

29:06.846 --> 29:08.679
I'm not.

29:09.749 --> 29:11.115
She is.

29:12.518 --> 29:14.284
¶ Now it's time to rise up ¶

29:14.286 --> 29:16.620
¶ Or it's time
to stand down ¶

29:16.622 --> 29:21.058
¶ And the answer
is easy to see ¶

29:21.060 --> 29:23.060
¶ And I swear by the sword ¶

29:23.062 --> 29:25.295
¶ If you're in get on board ¶

29:25.297 --> 29:27.898
-¶ Are you ready? ¶
-¶ I'm ready ¶

29:27.900 --> 29:30.734
-¶ We're ready ¶
-¶ We're ready ¶

29:30.736 --> 29:34.772
¶ Ready as I'll ever be ¶

29:34.774 --> 29:36.106
There you are!

29:36.108 --> 29:38.909
Yes, yes.
I just had to make
a stop in the kitchen.

29:38.911 --> 29:42.045
I'm told you're pretty handy
with one of these.

29:42.047 --> 29:44.381
(chuckles)
I sure am.

29:45.451 --> 29:49.486
¶ Are you quite sure
we can do this? ¶

29:49.488 --> 29:53.390
¶ Together we will
guarantee ¶

29:53.392 --> 29:56.059
¶ I'll make them hear me ¶

29:56.061 --> 29:58.061
¶ It's time to move on ¶

29:58.063 --> 30:00.964
¶ If they can trust me ¶

30:00.966 --> 30:04.735
¶ I'll save my home and family ¶

30:04.737 --> 30:06.804
¶ Now the fight's in the sand ¶

30:06.806 --> 30:08.939
¶ And our moment's at hand ¶

30:08.941 --> 30:11.275
-¶ And I'm ready ¶
-¶ I'm ready ¶

30:11.277 --> 30:14.244
¶ I'm ready ¶

30:14.246 --> 30:17.781
¶ Ready as I'll ¶

30:17.783 --> 30:20.717
¶ Ever be ¶

30:22.354 --> 30:23.854
Keep an eye out, everyone.

30:23.856 --> 30:25.422
It's too quiet for my liking.

30:26.358 --> 30:28.792
I can fix that.
(clears throat)

30:28.794 --> 30:30.994
(off-key)
¶ I got the wind
in my hair ¶

30:30.996 --> 30:32.529
Can it, Half-Pint.

30:34.300 --> 30:37.835
What a happy family reunion
this will be.

30:37.837 --> 30:38.969
(gasps)

30:38.971 --> 30:40.504
For both of us.

30:44.043 --> 30:46.743
(whispering)
Varian's lab should
be right above us.

30:51.684 --> 30:54.051
-(wood creaks)
-Frederic: Ah, careful.

30:56.989 --> 30:58.922
-(creaking)
-(squeaks)

31:13.973 --> 31:15.539
-What?
-(Rapunzel gasps)

31:16.575 --> 31:18.075
What is this?

31:18.077 --> 31:19.910
(mechanical whirring)

31:23.182 --> 31:24.882
(grunting)

31:24.884 --> 31:26.984
(Varian laughing)

31:29.088 --> 31:30.354
Welcome back...

31:30.356 --> 31:31.989
-(gasps)
-...Rapunzel.

31:36.061 --> 31:37.561
Maybe Rapunzel was wrong,

31:37.563 --> 31:40.364
and we overestimated
the little guy.

31:40.366 --> 31:42.232
You don't know Varian
very well, do you, buddy?

31:42.234 --> 31:44.434
-(music playing)
-Shh! Listen.

31:44.436 --> 31:47.404
(music tinkling ominously)

31:50.042 --> 31:51.775
(rumbling)

31:55.347 --> 31:57.881
Oh man, not this guy again!

31:57.883 --> 31:59.383
Okay, everyone.

31:59.385 --> 32:02.185
This thing may be tough,
but we got him outnumbered.

32:02.187 --> 32:05.589
Uh, Cass?
Are you sure about that?

32:08.961 --> 32:10.661
It's an ambush!

32:11.864 --> 32:14.064
Varian, I demand
you release us,

32:14.066 --> 32:16.199
and tell me
where the queen is.

32:16.201 --> 32:19.269
Your Majesty, I know
it's hard for you,

32:19.271 --> 32:21.138
but for the first time
in your life...

32:21.140 --> 32:25.208
-(squeaks)
-...you are in no position
to demand anything.

32:25.210 --> 32:27.077
But in the spirit of compromise,

32:27.079 --> 32:28.679
how 'bout I meet ya halfway?

32:30.616 --> 32:33.150
-(gasps)
-(gasps) Mom!

32:33.152 --> 32:34.618
I'm okay, Rapunzel.

32:34.620 --> 32:37.621
Let her go, Varian! Please!

32:37.623 --> 32:40.157
First, you're going to do
something for me.

32:40.159 --> 32:41.291
What do you want?

32:41.293 --> 32:44.962
Oh! So now you care
about what I want.

32:44.964 --> 32:49.199
(laughs)
All it took was threatening
the things you love the most.

32:54.273 --> 32:55.806
Don't let up!

32:55.808 --> 32:57.007
(grunting)

32:57.943 --> 32:59.209
(Max whinnies)

33:03.816 --> 33:05.515
(grunts)

33:08.287 --> 33:10.520
They've shielded
their timing cylinder.

33:11.790 --> 33:13.357
Max, split up!

33:18.931 --> 33:21.598
Man, these things
are almost as tough as--

33:23.002 --> 33:24.067
Ah-ha!

33:25.304 --> 33:28.305
Guys! The rocks!
Use the rocks!

33:28.307 --> 33:29.840
(yelling)

33:29.842 --> 33:33.343
(growling)

33:37.850 --> 33:38.949
(explosion)

33:44.623 --> 33:46.123
(explosion)

33:46.125 --> 33:49.493
-Good thinking.
-Well, I'm a problem solver.
It's what I do.

33:49.495 --> 33:51.695
-(music tinkling)
-(mechanical clanking)

33:54.867 --> 33:56.533
-Oh, come on!
-Oh, come on!

33:57.870 --> 33:59.636
Frederic:
What are you going
to do, Varian?

33:59.638 --> 34:01.471
Yeah, I'll--
I'll spare you the details

34:01.473 --> 34:03.507
about the Sun Drop and darkness,
blah, blah, blah,

34:03.509 --> 34:05.142
and get to the good stuff.

34:08.380 --> 34:09.946
Unbreakable.

34:11.884 --> 34:13.183
Unbreakable.

34:13.185 --> 34:15.552
To put it plainly,
with assistance from my drill,

34:15.554 --> 34:19.523
Rapunzel's hair should
be able to shatter the amber,

34:19.525 --> 34:21.158
and free my father.

34:21.160 --> 34:22.526
What do you mean "should"?

34:22.528 --> 34:25.162
Oh, I suppose
it's just as likely

34:25.164 --> 34:27.197
the amber
shatters Rapunzel.

34:27.199 --> 34:29.499
-I mean, the properties--
-Absolutely not.

34:29.501 --> 34:31.401
It's not your choice, Dad.

34:32.504 --> 34:34.371
She's right, Dad.

34:34.373 --> 34:35.772
Oh! And I almost forgot,

34:35.774 --> 34:37.174
we're, uh, kinda
on a time crunch here,

34:37.176 --> 34:38.842
so I'm gonna need
to speed things along.

34:40.079 --> 34:41.344
(crackling)

34:43.682 --> 34:45.115
(inhales sharply)

34:45.117 --> 34:46.349
Varian, stop!

34:47.286 --> 34:48.351
Well...

34:52.925 --> 34:54.591
shall we get started?

34:59.898 --> 35:02.199
Lance! Let's give 'em
the old bob and weave.

35:02.201 --> 35:04.201
On it!

35:04.203 --> 35:05.569
(powering down)

35:05.571 --> 35:07.104
Ha! Still got it!

35:07.106 --> 35:08.371
(explosions)

35:16.782 --> 35:18.215
(clangs)

35:20.219 --> 35:21.685
(explosion)

35:27.259 --> 35:29.192
(powering down)

35:31.296 --> 35:32.362
(explosion)

35:44.243 --> 35:46.076
(crackling)

35:46.078 --> 35:47.944
Varian, if this
doesn't work,

35:47.946 --> 35:49.412
and something
happens to me,

35:49.414 --> 35:53.283
please, please,
let my mom go.

35:53.285 --> 35:56.820
I can't make
any promises, Princess.

35:56.822 --> 35:58.989
(drill whirs)

35:58.991 --> 36:00.991
(gasps, screams)

36:00.993 --> 36:02.726
(Rapunzel groaning)

36:07.633 --> 36:10.667
(whooshing)

36:10.669 --> 36:13.336
(screams)
What?!

36:13.338 --> 36:15.071
-Why?
-(drill whirs)

36:16.708 --> 36:18.909
(groaning)

36:23.482 --> 36:25.282
(squeaking)

36:25.284 --> 36:28.518
Stop it!
She can't take anymore!

36:28.520 --> 36:29.719
Rapunzel!

36:33.458 --> 36:35.292
-(drill stops)
-I jus-- I-I don't understand!

36:35.294 --> 36:37.360
Why won't it--

36:37.362 --> 36:39.663
Her hair! It--
it should've cut through it!

36:39.665 --> 36:41.097
Why didn't it work?!

36:46.672 --> 36:47.971
(sizzling)

36:47.973 --> 36:49.472
Arianna!

36:52.644 --> 36:54.578
Frederic:
Rapunzel.

36:54.580 --> 36:55.979
Rapunzel!

36:59.051 --> 37:00.717
No! No!

37:00.719 --> 37:02.586
I wasn't wrong!

37:02.588 --> 37:04.521
It's not my fault!

37:04.523 --> 37:06.523
None of it is!

37:06.525 --> 37:08.325
It's her fault.

37:08.327 --> 37:11.061
Rapunzel, are you okay?

37:11.063 --> 37:12.495
(sighs)

37:12.497 --> 37:13.797
Yes, I will be.

37:15.234 --> 37:16.366
Varian.

37:16.368 --> 37:18.101
Oh, where did he go?

37:18.103 --> 37:20.103
-(rumbling)
-(squeaks, screams)

37:23.408 --> 37:25.242
Varian:
Sorry, Princess!

37:25.244 --> 37:26.843
We were in this together!

37:26.845 --> 37:28.845
But if I can't have
a happy ending,

37:28.847 --> 37:30.580
then neither can you!

37:30.582 --> 37:32.482
(Varian shouts)

37:37.723 --> 37:39.889
-(clatters)
-(explosion)

37:39.891 --> 37:41.958
All right! Who's next?

37:44.363 --> 37:45.528
Rapunzel!

37:49.134 --> 37:50.400
Sorry, buddy,
but there's a line.

37:50.402 --> 37:53.536
(screaming)

37:56.475 --> 37:58.275
Varian:
Hello, Cassandra.

37:58.277 --> 38:01.378
I always knew I could
sweep you off your feet.

38:01.380 --> 38:03.613
Arianna:
Let her go, Varian!

38:05.150 --> 38:06.349
-Arianna!
-Mom!

38:08.587 --> 38:09.853
(clangs)

38:15.127 --> 38:17.594
That's enough, Varian.

38:17.596 --> 38:19.162
It's not enough

38:19.164 --> 38:22.465
until you endure
the same amount of pain

38:22.467 --> 38:24.534
and agony I have!

38:26.605 --> 38:27.804
(groans)

38:27.806 --> 38:29.306
Arianna.

38:29.308 --> 38:30.473
(groaning)

38:33.612 --> 38:34.711
(groaning)

38:39.851 --> 38:41.051
What's happening?

38:48.794 --> 38:49.859
Rapunzel!

38:53.532 --> 38:55.498
(wind whistling)

39:00.172 --> 39:02.539
(explosion)

39:08.947 --> 39:12.349
Rapunzel, you are connected
to them somehow.

39:12.351 --> 39:14.517
Stop running, Rapunzel.

39:14.519 --> 39:15.785
Face your destiny.

39:31.803 --> 39:34.471
(breathes deeply)

39:34.473 --> 39:37.540
(screams)

39:43.548 --> 39:45.582
(robot powers down)

39:47.352 --> 39:48.485
My darling.

39:51.089 --> 39:52.589
Rapunzel!

39:58.497 --> 39:59.929
(grunts)

40:02.567 --> 40:04.401
(mechanical whirring)

40:12.444 --> 40:14.010
(grunting)

40:25.524 --> 40:27.457
(screams)

40:28.627 --> 40:29.926
(powers down)

40:34.766 --> 40:36.466
No!

40:57.222 --> 40:58.755
Rapunzel!

40:58.757 --> 41:00.290
Blondie.

41:05.730 --> 41:06.963
Hi.

41:06.965 --> 41:10.633
(laughs)
We have got to start finding

41:10.635 --> 41:12.702
better ways to spend
your birthdays.

41:36.962 --> 41:38.661
(chitters)

41:40.098 --> 41:42.398
I will make you
proud of me, Dad...

41:44.970 --> 41:47.871
if it's the last thing
I ever do.

41:47.873 --> 41:50.607
Don't be too hard
on him, Dad.

41:50.609 --> 41:54.110
I'll be sure to do
everything I can
to get him help.

41:54.112 --> 41:55.612
As for Quirin,

41:55.614 --> 41:58.114
I'll not give up until
I find a way to free him.

42:00.986 --> 42:02.452
(squeaks)

42:02.454 --> 42:06.456
It's like the rocks
want us to follow them.

42:06.458 --> 42:07.891
Frederic:
I think you're right.

42:07.893 --> 42:11.194
At first, I believed
the rocks' purpose
was to destroy Corona,

42:11.196 --> 42:12.495
I was wrong.

42:12.497 --> 42:14.831
I can see now that
they're pointing in a direction.

42:14.833 --> 42:16.799
Pointing you in a direction.

42:16.801 --> 42:18.735
I only regret that
it has taken all this

42:18.737 --> 42:21.504
to convince me that
I should be doing the same.

42:21.506 --> 42:24.240
Rapunzel, when you
were returned to us,

42:24.242 --> 42:27.977
I swore I would
never let anything
ever happen to you again.

42:27.979 --> 42:30.647
But, Dad, we talked about this.

42:30.649 --> 42:33.249
-I don't--
-I know, I know.
You're right.

42:33.251 --> 42:34.717
This past year,

42:34.719 --> 42:37.420
you showed me that
there is so much more in you

42:37.422 --> 42:39.822
than I could have
ever imagined.

42:39.824 --> 42:42.358
I've just been too afraid
to let you go.

42:42.360 --> 42:45.828
But this path
is yours to follow.

42:45.830 --> 42:48.298
And if you ever
lose your way...

43:02.714 --> 43:04.247
Thank you,
Dad.

43:04.249 --> 43:06.616
I love you
so much.

43:06.618 --> 43:08.918
And I love you
too, sweetheart.

43:12.390 --> 43:14.357
Find your destiny, Rapunzel.

43:15.760 --> 43:17.560
I'll take care of her,
Your Majesty.

43:17.562 --> 43:20.863
Eugene, you should know by now,

43:20.865 --> 43:23.900
Rapunzel doesn't need anyone
to take care of her.

43:23.902 --> 43:25.935
(chuckles)
Touché.

43:36.648 --> 43:37.947
(squeaks)

43:43.254 --> 43:45.555
(footsteps)

44:00.305 --> 44:03.673
