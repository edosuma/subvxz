00:49.670 --> 00:52.459
She's not a citizen.

00:52.460 --> 00:54.459
But I've always...
Voted illegally?

00:54.460 --> 00:55.999
Yeah, where's your I.D.?

00:56.000 --> 00:57.789
Let me show you my I.D.
You know why?

00:57.790 --> 00:59.959
'Cause I bring my I.D.
'Cause I do it legally.

00:59.960 --> 01:02.379
Come on. And them, too,
where's their documentation?

01:02.380 --> 01:04.248
They don't need I.D. to vote.

01:04.250 --> 01:05.498
They're committing voter fraud.

01:05.500 --> 01:07.669
You need to back up! Ho, hey.

01:07.670 --> 01:09.249
I have every right to be here. Hey,
don't leave. You don't need to leave.

01:09.250 --> 01:11.919
I have every right to be here. Jay,
maybe we should vote another day.

01:11.920 --> 01:13.579
People show their I.D.s. There is
no other day. This is the day.

01:13.580 --> 01:15.379
That's the way it works in this country.
Maybe we vote another year.

01:15.380 --> 01:17.379
You're citizens.
I was at the swearing-in.

01:17.380 --> 01:19.789
You were, too. Can I just ask
you, did you show your I.D.?

01:19.790 --> 01:22.539
I can't be yelling?
All right, let me tell you this.

01:22.540 --> 01:25.249
Voter fraud is a felony!

01:25.250 --> 01:27.169
You vote illegally,
you go to jail!

01:27.170 --> 01:29.959
Intimidating voters
is a federal crime!

01:29.960 --> 01:31.619
Is there security
around here somewhere?

01:31.620 --> 01:33.879
There's a hotline
you could try calling.

01:33.880 --> 01:35.040
We're gonna vote. After...

01:40.330 --> 01:43.920
Better go call the hotline.

01:46.710 --> 01:47.919
This is Kate.

01:47.920 --> 01:49.669
Kate, this is Jay. Jay Simmons.

01:49.670 --> 01:50.999
I need your help.

01:51.000 --> 01:52.289
I'm at my polling place...

01:52.290 --> 01:54.039
Wow. Word has really gotten out.

01:54.040 --> 01:58.039
Okay. So, "no" on Question 1.

01:58.040 --> 02:00.039
I pref... No, I don't need
help with my ballot.

02:00.040 --> 02:02.879
There's a problem here
at my polling place.

02:02.880 --> 02:04.709
What kind of problem?

02:04.710 --> 02:06.419
Voter intimidation in New York?

02:06.420 --> 02:08.249
New York has
some of the most regressive,

02:08.250 --> 02:09.619
voter-restrictive laws
in the country...

02:09.620 --> 02:11.079
I'm from Texas.

02:11.080 --> 02:12.419
Can you come with me
to the courthouse?

02:12.420 --> 02:14.169
Why do you need me?

02:14.170 --> 02:15.329
Anything not in this warrant
or affidavit

02:15.330 --> 02:16.879
I should know about,
Ms. Littlejohn?

02:16.880 --> 02:20.079
No. I know you sometimes like
to squirrel away information

02:20.080 --> 02:21.829
and then turn it over
at the last minute.

02:21.830 --> 02:26.670
No. Your Honor, those documents
are complete and accurate.

02:27.960 --> 02:29.500
Good idea bringing him along.

02:33.210 --> 02:35.499
Oliver, let's go.

02:35.500 --> 02:39.119
Petrini crime family.
Do you know them?

02:39.120 --> 02:41.539
Violent and Organized Crime Unit
has been trying to build

02:41.540 --> 02:44.119
a RICO case against the Petrini
family for two years,

02:44.120 --> 02:46.119
getting nowhere,
then, two weeks ago,

02:46.120 --> 02:49.329
Angelo Petrini,
nephew of boss Gaetano Petrini,

02:49.330 --> 02:53.289
walks into a field office on
23rd Street, and he is singing.

02:53.290 --> 02:55.119
No. What?

02:55.120 --> 02:57.329
No. I know exactly what this is.

02:57.330 --> 02:59.119
You tell me I'm working
on the Petrini case,

02:59.120 --> 03:00.709
I look skeptical,
you convince me it's real,

03:00.710 --> 03:02.829
we start humming the theme
from "The Godfather,"

03:02.830 --> 03:04.789
and then I wake up, and there's
some kid in my office

03:04.790 --> 03:07.169
telling me it's "Avatar"!
I'm not doing that again!

03:07.170 --> 03:09.040
No!

03:10.880 --> 03:15.669
On the other hand,
if this isn't a dream,

03:15.670 --> 03:17.669
then what I'm saying sounds
completely insane.

03:17.670 --> 03:19.499
That is correct.

03:19.500 --> 03:22.119
Rosen had to jump off the case,
so this is yours.

03:22.120 --> 03:24.710
Lock down the Angelo testimony.

03:29.290 --> 03:30.879
Personal or professional?

03:30.880 --> 03:32.209
Professional.

03:32.210 --> 03:34.209
Personal. I'm not actually sure.

03:34.210 --> 03:35.999
You didn't,
show up the other night.

03:36.000 --> 03:37.080
I haven't seen you in days.

03:38.880 --> 03:41.289
I can't really talk now.

03:41.290 --> 03:42.750
I'm sorry.

03:56.750 --> 03:58.620
You two haven't talked?

04:08.080 --> 04:11.289
The integrity of our entire
democracy is at risk here,

04:11.290 --> 04:13.079
and I'm the one being arrested?

04:13.080 --> 04:14.459
Our government
should be thanking me.

04:14.460 --> 04:16.709
I understand
that's your opinion,

04:16.709 --> 04:19.879
but intimidation of voters is
a federal crime, a serious one.

04:19.880 --> 04:22.959
What's serious is the epidemic
of election fraud.

04:22.960 --> 04:24.499
Don't you read FraudWars?

04:24.500 --> 04:26.879
I do not. FraudWars is
where the facts are.

04:26.880 --> 04:30.379
All those secrets the mainstream
media tries to bury?

04:30.380 --> 04:31.539
FraudWars finds them.

04:31.540 --> 04:34.289
Do you have any idea
how many foreign nationals

04:34.290 --> 04:35.579
voted in the last election?

04:35.580 --> 04:36.999
Nineteen. Millions.

04:37.000 --> 04:39.209
Only nineteen were charged,
I mean.

04:39.210 --> 04:40.999
In the entire country. You see?

04:41.000 --> 04:42.209
My point exactly.

04:42.210 --> 04:45.829
Let's talk about your defense.

04:45.830 --> 04:47.459
They said a lawyer
was part of the deal.

04:47.460 --> 04:49.879
Are... Are you the lawyer?

04:49.880 --> 04:51.999
Who said a lawyer
was part of what deal?

04:52.000 --> 04:53.579
If I'm charged
with any crime in connection

04:53.580 --> 04:55.169
with the verification
of voter identity,

04:55.170 --> 04:56.789
a lawyer will be provided,

04:56.790 --> 04:58.789
the compensation for which
will not be reduced

04:58.790 --> 05:00.289
from the amount
otherwise due to me.

05:00.290 --> 05:03.169
You were paid
for what you were doing

05:03.170 --> 05:04.789
this morning
at the polling place?

05:04.790 --> 05:07.079
Well, I haven't been paid yet.

05:07.080 --> 05:10.079
You were hired to disrupt
a federal election?

05:10.080 --> 05:12.499
That was the idea.

05:12.500 --> 05:13.540
Democracy isn't free.

05:24.540 --> 05:27.039
Four instances
of voter intimidation

05:27.040 --> 05:28.249
in the tri-state area alone.
And I found dozens more

05:28.250 --> 05:29.210
all around the country
just like this one.

05:29.211 --> 05:31.039
Same phrases. Same techniques.

05:31.040 --> 05:33.789
Challenging people's
residency and citizenship.

05:33.790 --> 05:34.959
And you're saying they were paid?
Yes.

05:34.960 --> 05:36.749
By whom? We don't know.

05:36.750 --> 05:39.079
But if you immunize Harley,
we can help you find out.

05:39.080 --> 05:40.789
He'll cooperate?
He told me he would.

05:40.790 --> 05:41.919
How does Jay feel about that?

05:41.920 --> 05:44.749
Jay? I have no idea.

05:44.750 --> 05:46.499
Why?

05:46.500 --> 05:47.999
You were there?
I reported the case to Kate.

05:48.000 --> 05:49.789
She got the warrant.
Did Jill know this?

05:49.790 --> 05:51.209
I guess not.
You're defending him?

05:51.210 --> 05:52.789
Well, not for very much longer!

05:52.790 --> 05:55.329
I can't defend the guy if you're
going to be a potential witness.

05:55.330 --> 05:56.999
Harley is going to
need new counsel.

05:57.000 --> 05:59.289
He has new counsel.
So you did know about this?

05:59.290 --> 06:00.919
Know about what? I was there.

06:00.920 --> 06:02.879
He was intimidating my parents.

06:02.880 --> 06:04.499
I didn't know that.

06:04.500 --> 06:06.879
We just got a notice that
he substituted in new counsel.

06:06.880 --> 06:09.250
A private firm.
And a very good one.

06:38.790 --> 06:42.379
You guys met. Good.

06:42.380 --> 06:43.579
A bodyguard? Yes.

06:43.580 --> 06:44.749
Why do I need a bodyguard?

06:44.750 --> 06:45.829
'Cause they're gonna
try to kill you.

06:45.830 --> 06:47.419
Kill me?! Yes.

06:47.420 --> 06:48.829
You didn't mention
anything about that!

06:48.830 --> 06:51.579
Really? I-Is that why
Rosen isn't on the case?

06:51.580 --> 06:52.959
Well, Rosen has a kid
and a wife.

06:52.960 --> 06:54.379
He has a lot to live for.

06:54.380 --> 06:57.249
You'll probably be fine,
though. Right?

06:57.250 --> 06:58.830
Sure.

07:04.290 --> 07:05.750
I need to talk to you.

07:10.290 --> 07:12.210
Listen.

07:14.250 --> 07:15.879
I told her.

07:15.880 --> 07:17.919
That I know about her and Roger.

07:17.920 --> 07:19.749
You told me not to, but I did.

07:19.750 --> 07:21.709
I didn't tell you not to.
I told you I wouldn't.

07:21.710 --> 07:24.289
Well, I did.

07:24.290 --> 07:25.459
Because what she's
doing is wrong

07:25.460 --> 07:27.119
and I think she needs to end it.

07:27.120 --> 07:29.880
Okay. You don't
have to convince me.

07:32.330 --> 07:34.919
You got me the swatting report.
I just thought you should know.

07:34.920 --> 07:37.709
Jill's been good to me.

07:37.710 --> 07:39.119
Really good to me
when I needed it.

07:39.120 --> 07:41.329
I'm not neutral on Jill.

07:41.330 --> 07:45.749
But I'm not neutral on you,
either.

07:45.750 --> 07:48.329
Which I think you know.

07:48.330 --> 07:51.499
If you believe this
is the right thing to do,

07:51.500 --> 07:55.460
then I'm with you.

07:58.170 --> 08:02.880
Chief of the Criminal Division
and the Federal Public Defender.

08:04.170 --> 08:06.749
I can see why you're here.

08:06.750 --> 08:10.379
Is there any way
around this, Judge?

08:10.380 --> 08:13.579
Not if you want to
keep your jobs.

08:13.580 --> 08:18.579
Look, if you were a client
in your office

08:18.580 --> 08:22.789
and you found this out,
how would you feel?

08:22.790 --> 08:24.669
What would you think?

08:24.670 --> 08:28.789
If we lived in a different time,
I might answer differently.

08:28.790 --> 08:31.539
But we're all that's left now.

08:31.540 --> 08:33.578
This. Us.

08:33.580 --> 08:35.789
An independent judicial system.

08:35.789 --> 08:39.328
We're the last fortification
against tyranny,

08:39.330 --> 08:42.919
and it's not the marble around
here that's gonna protect us.

08:42.919 --> 08:45.749
It's our integrity.

08:45.750 --> 08:49.919
In the eyes of others.

08:49.920 --> 08:51.670
That's all we have.

08:55.290 --> 08:57.380
I'm sorry, Jill.

09:04.790 --> 09:06.829
Hey. How's it going?

09:06.830 --> 09:07.920
Really bizarre day.

09:10.420 --> 09:13.619
Who are you? Jay, this is Gabe.

09:13.620 --> 09:15.249
He's gonna be staying with us
for a while.

09:15.250 --> 09:18.249
What? I have a case in
which I could be killed.

09:18.250 --> 09:20.039
You could be, too.
Are you serious?

09:20.040 --> 09:21.169
I don't know. Could he?

09:21.170 --> 09:22.210
Sure.

09:25.040 --> 09:26.379
Hey!

09:26.380 --> 09:28.079
What the hell?!
That was my dinner!

09:28.080 --> 09:29.040
It smelled like poison.

09:29.041 --> 09:30.670
See. He's here for both of us.

09:34.500 --> 09:36.080
Good night, Jay!

09:38.880 --> 09:40.710
Good night, Gabe.

09:48.960 --> 09:51.619
Why does he have a new lawyer?
Because whoever is paying him

09:51.620 --> 09:53.209
to disrupt this election
wants to control his defense

09:53.210 --> 09:54.619
so he doesn't talk.

09:54.620 --> 09:55.879
Look, this isn't
our case anymore,

09:55.880 --> 09:57.709
so I can express
an opinion here.

09:57.710 --> 09:58.879
I hope you guys pursue this.

09:58.880 --> 10:00.749
Plus one. We will.

10:00.750 --> 10:02.119
We can still bring the weight
of the government down on him.

10:02.120 --> 10:04.459
I'm not sure how much putting
pressure on him will even help.

10:04.460 --> 10:07.539
Harley's the key.
Or maybe this new lawyer is.

10:07.540 --> 10:09.749
Why do you say that?
How much does Harley even know

10:09.750 --> 10:12.249
about this whole operation?
I'm guessing he's a stooge.

10:12.250 --> 10:14.039
Based on my time with him,
I think that's a good guess.

10:14.040 --> 10:16.829
But if we figure out
who this new lawyer is,

10:16.830 --> 10:18.079
we might be
able to unravel this.

10:18.080 --> 10:19.709
That might have given us
a gift here.

10:19.710 --> 10:21.669
Okay. So who is this new lawyer?

10:21.670 --> 10:23.789
Bob Dickerson. Sorry I'm late.

10:23.790 --> 10:25.999
He's a partner at Walsh Gates,
where he represents

10:26.000 --> 10:29.419
multiple high-ranking
government officials who serve

10:29.420 --> 10:33.419
on the Board of the Alliance
for American Advancement,

10:33.420 --> 10:36.579
a "pro-business" advocacy group
that was responsible

10:36.580 --> 10:40.750
for paying Harley Kemp
to harass my parents.

10:42.420 --> 10:45.379
I was up all night 'cause
Seth's bodyguard was snoring,

10:45.380 --> 10:47.919
but I found the time
unusually productive.

10:47.920 --> 10:50.749
- So gross.
- Can you run through this again?

10:50.750 --> 10:53.289
Okay, the Alliance
for American Advancement claims

10:53.290 --> 10:55.829
to be a responsible non-profit
which raises money

10:55.830 --> 10:58.039
for "issue advocacy."

10:58.040 --> 11:00.459
Deregulation, tax cuts,
that sort of thing.

11:00.460 --> 11:03.789
But, in fact, it's a front
for voter suppression

11:03.790 --> 11:05.709
that uses well-connected lawyers

11:05.710 --> 11:08.119
and a series of artfully named
shell companies...

11:08.120 --> 11:10.079
VoteSafe,
the Voter Sanctity Project,

11:10.080 --> 11:11.579
the Voter Justice League...

11:11.580 --> 11:15.459
To pay people like Harley
to intimidate voters.

11:15.460 --> 11:17.539
These companies fund lawsuits

11:17.540 --> 11:20.169
to purge legitimate voters
from the rolls

11:20.170 --> 11:22.499
and media campaigns
to scare voters.

11:22.500 --> 11:24.329
People of color. Poor people.

11:24.330 --> 11:26.499
Brand-new citizens.
People like my mom and dad.

11:26.500 --> 11:28.119
So who do we go after?

11:28.120 --> 11:29.669
Who's running the Alliance?

11:29.670 --> 11:32.119
Thorne Spiller.
I did a little digging, too.

11:32.120 --> 11:34.079
Spiller started off
as a political operative.

11:34.080 --> 11:35.459
Smear campaigns. Dirty tricks.

11:35.460 --> 11:37.789
Then he graduated
to corporate espionage.

11:37.790 --> 11:38.790
Now suppression of votes.

11:38.791 --> 11:40.209
So Spiller runs the Alliance,

11:40.210 --> 11:42.789
which uses shell companies
to pay the Harleys.

11:42.790 --> 11:44.079
What do we charge Spiller with?

11:44.080 --> 11:45.669
We can't get him on
voter intimidation directly...

11:45.670 --> 11:47.289
And even if we could,
that wouldn't be enough

11:47.290 --> 11:49.290
to bring down an elaborate
operation like this.

12:04.960 --> 12:06.829
Are you thinking
what I'm thinking?

12:06.830 --> 12:08.420
Unlikely.

12:09.460 --> 12:10.879
Yes, the same
racketeering statute

12:10.880 --> 12:12.169
they use to take down the mob

12:12.170 --> 12:13.749
can be used to take down
a voter-suppression cabal.

12:13.750 --> 12:15.539
Spiller told donors
to the Alliance

12:15.540 --> 12:17.169
that their money
would be used for one thing,

12:17.170 --> 12:18.539
but it was used for another.

12:18.540 --> 12:20.959
Any funds they sent anywhere
at that point were fraudulent.

12:20.960 --> 12:22.539
Which means RICO laws apply.

12:22.540 --> 12:24.039
Which has never been tried
in this context.

12:24.040 --> 12:25.419
Well, we're not trying it now.

12:25.420 --> 12:26.579
We know it's uphill...

12:26.580 --> 12:27.959
You don't know the half of it.

12:27.960 --> 12:30.749
All voting cases
are supposed to be prosecuted

12:30.750 --> 12:32.169
by the Justice Department.

12:32.170 --> 12:33.669
All of them. You know that.

12:33.670 --> 12:36.039
This warrant shouldn't
ever have come through

12:36.040 --> 12:37.459
this office in the first place.

12:37.460 --> 12:39.249
These charges
shouldn't have been filed.

12:39.250 --> 12:41.209
Well, this is where we are now.

12:41.210 --> 12:42.329
And now we're getting out.

12:42.330 --> 12:43.419
This is political treason.

12:43.420 --> 12:45.620
If we can't do this,
what are we doing here?

12:52.210 --> 12:54.789
You see this chair, Roger?

12:54.790 --> 12:58.379
This chair belonged
to Henry Lawrence Burnett.

12:58.380 --> 13:00.999
He held my job
in the early 1900s.

13:01.000 --> 13:02.669
After fighting in the Civil War

13:02.670 --> 13:06.669
and prosecuting the conspiracy
to assassinate Lincoln.

13:06.670 --> 13:09.459
The Attorney General himself
got it out of storage for me

13:09.460 --> 13:10.669
when I was first sworn in.

13:10.670 --> 13:12.379
Nice gesture, right?

13:12.380 --> 13:14.749
No. It wasn't a gesture at all.

13:14.750 --> 13:17.919
It was a warning that the chair
lives longer than I do.

13:17.920 --> 13:21.539
That I can be out of this job
faster than it stops spinning.

13:21.540 --> 13:26.119
You're asking me
to approve an uphill,

13:26.120 --> 13:28.749
untested, untried prosecution

13:28.750 --> 13:30.959
against the people
who own all the chairs.

13:30.960 --> 13:32.879
The board of this organization?

13:32.880 --> 13:34.499
And what it represents?

13:34.500 --> 13:38.919
It's everything this
administration stands for.

13:38.920 --> 13:41.829
I'm gonna take that on for
a prosecution we can't even win?

13:41.830 --> 13:43.669
No.

13:43.670 --> 13:46.459
I'm not ready to give up
this chair.

13:46.460 --> 13:49.710
It's not my time yet.
It's not yours, either.

13:54.330 --> 13:58.499
Plead out Kemp
and bury the Spiller case.

13:58.500 --> 13:59.710
I'm sorry.

14:02.830 --> 14:04.619
I want to review
some of the testimony

14:04.620 --> 14:06.619
you gave to Mr. Rosen, okay?

14:06.620 --> 14:09.579
On April 8th, FBI surveillance
picked up an incoming call

14:09.580 --> 14:12.379
to your cellphone
from Salvatore Parisi.

14:12.380 --> 14:14.209
If you say so.

14:14.210 --> 14:16.619
In that call, Mr. Parisi said,

14:16.620 --> 14:20.249
"I need you to clean up
that dirt Little Matty spilled.

14:20.250 --> 14:22.169
Come by and pick up the tools."

14:22.170 --> 14:24.169
That's what that paper says,
I guess.

14:24.170 --> 14:25.959
When you met with Mr. Parisi,

14:25.960 --> 14:27.579
he further clarified
what he meant?

14:27.580 --> 14:28.709
Did he?

14:28.710 --> 14:32.119
You said he gave you the "tool,"

14:32.120 --> 14:34.709
which was then passed on
to Giancarlo Cabrizzi

14:34.710 --> 14:36.879
and used in the murder
of Hector Cruz.

14:36.880 --> 14:38.249
Is that correct?

14:38.250 --> 14:41.459
No, no, not at all.
What happened was...

14:41.460 --> 14:42.829
Sal just wanted me to help him
in the garden.

14:42.830 --> 14:45.209
See, Sal, he's got a real
green thumb, but his kid,

14:45.210 --> 14:47.459
Little Matty,
total friggin' klutz.

14:47.460 --> 14:49.789
So I go over there, and then
Sal gave me one of those,

14:49.790 --> 14:52.379
you know...

14:52.380 --> 14:54.329
The thing. A planter?

14:54.330 --> 14:56.789
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
And, one of the...

14:56.790 --> 14:59.169
A shovel. Right, right, but one
of those little baby ones,

14:59.170 --> 15:02.209
and then, I was supposed to
put a thing in it.

15:02.210 --> 15:04.170
A... Plant.

15:06.790 --> 15:10.169
This is all wildly contradictory
to your previous statements.

15:10.170 --> 15:11.789
I was really stressed.

15:11.790 --> 15:13.999
Things weren't going so good
for me at work.

15:14.000 --> 15:15.999
You know how that goes.

15:16.000 --> 15:19.379
You're no longer cooperating
with the government?

15:19.380 --> 15:21.579
In that case,

15:21.580 --> 15:24.620
you will likely spend
the rest of your life in jail.

15:25.830 --> 15:28.459
But I will be alive.

15:28.460 --> 15:31.459
There's a reason why Rosen
left this case.

15:31.460 --> 15:33.459
Follow him.

15:33.460 --> 15:36.620
Because they will kill you
to kill this case.

15:48.790 --> 15:50.539
Personal or professional?

15:50.540 --> 15:53.079
Professional.

15:53.080 --> 15:56.459
Spiller.
We can't talk about that.

15:56.460 --> 15:58.790
I took it as far as I could.

16:01.080 --> 16:03.080
Personal.

16:05.080 --> 16:07.540
Sandra knows about us.

16:09.750 --> 16:11.169
This doesn't
have to be a problem.

16:11.170 --> 16:13.170
It is, though. You know it is.

16:15.380 --> 16:17.749
We haven't done anything wrong.

16:17.750 --> 16:19.290
We don't talk about work.

16:20.710 --> 16:22.289
We're not even talking about
work right now...

16:22.290 --> 16:24.170
Is that good?
I-I don't even know.

16:25.540 --> 16:28.670
This whole situation
is totally messed up.

16:30.500 --> 16:33.499
We are compromised in ways
we don't even understand.

16:33.500 --> 16:36.079
We don't know what we can talk
about and what we can't

16:36.080 --> 16:41.039
or how the things that are
unsaid impact what we do.

16:41.040 --> 16:43.499
Or don't do.

16:43.500 --> 16:46.540
If this comes out...
What are you saying?

16:48.080 --> 16:50.750
You know what I'm saying.

16:54.330 --> 16:56.329
There's an answer here.
The only answer

16:56.330 --> 17:01.210
is for one of us
to give up our jobs.

17:06.460 --> 17:09.118
We had fun. We hid.
We got caught.

17:09.119 --> 17:10.329
That's not what this was.

17:15.540 --> 17:17.329
But it can't be anything else.

17:21.670 --> 17:22.670
Jill...

17:44.580 --> 17:46.209
You're late.

17:46.210 --> 17:48.789
Um, it's 115 a.m.

17:48.790 --> 17:51.329
Well, if we're gonna give up
everything for this job,

17:51.330 --> 17:52.959
then what we do
ought to be worth it.

17:52.960 --> 17:54.539
I want you to bring me
everything we have

17:54.540 --> 17:56.169
on Spiller
and voter suppression.

17:56.170 --> 17:57.810
We're taking this
son of a bitch to trial.

18:02.210 --> 18:04.829
Mr. Knox. Ms. Littlejohn.

18:04.830 --> 18:06.039
We're ready when you are.

18:06.040 --> 18:07.459
We need to show fraud.

18:07.460 --> 18:09.459
That the money spent
on voter suppression

18:09.460 --> 18:12.039
was raised for other purposes.
Who do we have?

18:12.040 --> 18:13.829
My firm was contracted
to do fundraising

18:13.830 --> 18:15.079
for the Alliance
for over four years.

18:15.080 --> 18:17.039
When you raised these funds,
how would you do it?

18:17.040 --> 18:19.669
I would visit corporate leaders
and CEOs,

18:19.670 --> 18:21.829
generally in person,
and explain how their money

18:21.830 --> 18:22.919
would be used
to advocate issues.

18:22.920 --> 18:24.209
Issues such as...

18:24.210 --> 18:25.619
Corporate tax cuts,
deregulation.

18:25.620 --> 18:28.380
Did those issues
include voter suppression?

18:29.750 --> 18:32.539
Did I ask for donations
to break the law?

18:32.540 --> 18:34.329
Never. Not once.

18:34.330 --> 18:35.499
We need to show intent.

18:35.500 --> 18:37.499
That Spiller knew laws
were being broken.

18:37.500 --> 18:39.499
I've been on the
Alliance's board for five years.

18:39.500 --> 18:41.619
And you've given money
to the Alliance, Ms. Denman?

18:41.620 --> 18:44.209
I have. Were you aware that
much of the money you gave

18:44.210 --> 18:46.499
for the purpose
of business advocacy

18:46.500 --> 18:48.829
was actually being used
for voter suppression?

18:48.830 --> 18:50.959
No, but in retrospect,
I should have been.

18:50.960 --> 18:53.829
Can you explain? Mr. Spiller
told me he had "ways and means"

18:53.830 --> 18:56.249
of defeating
anti-corporate candidates.

18:56.250 --> 18:58.749
Did he describe
these "ways and means"?

18:58.750 --> 19:00.959
When I expressed concern over
a close Congressional race,

19:00.960 --> 19:02.879
he told me not to worry.

19:02.880 --> 19:04.829
He said, "Our people on the
ground will take care of it."

19:04.830 --> 19:06.289
We need to show harm.

19:06.290 --> 19:08.329
That the money Spiller raised
was actually being used

19:08.330 --> 19:10.119
on the ground to stop people
from voting.

19:10.120 --> 19:12.079
We lost Harley.
He won't cooperate.

19:12.080 --> 19:12.920
Well, then, we need to
make him cooperate.

19:12.921 --> 19:14.459
Release the hounds.

19:14.460 --> 19:16.619
Thank you, Your Honor.
In addition to a pending charge

19:16.620 --> 19:18.789
for voter intimidation,
the government expects to file

19:18.790 --> 19:20.789
14 new charges against Mr. Kemp

19:20.790 --> 19:22.419
related to an illegal tax scheme

19:22.420 --> 19:23.919
involving Mr. Kemp
and his sister.

19:23.920 --> 19:26.119
This investigation is ongoing,
and there may still be

19:26.120 --> 19:27.789
additional counts forthcoming.

19:27.790 --> 19:29.789
Of course, as always,
we are happy to discuss

19:29.790 --> 19:32.499
a comprehensive cooperation
agreement with Mr. Kemp.

19:32.500 --> 19:34.959
I was paid $4,000
to challenge voters.

19:34.960 --> 19:37.539
Were you told specifically
how to challenge them?

19:37.540 --> 19:38.619
Yeah, we had training.

19:38.620 --> 19:40.249
How to single out an illegal

19:40.250 --> 19:42.419
or someone who looked like they
were gonna be fraudulent.

19:42.420 --> 19:45.539
How to single "an illegal" out
and do what?

19:45.540 --> 19:46.749
To get them not to vote.

19:46.750 --> 19:48.119
I think we have this.

19:48.120 --> 19:50.579
Well done.
We don't have it. Not yet.

19:50.580 --> 19:52.039
Anyone ever tell you you're
terrible with compliments?

19:52.040 --> 19:53.289
That wasn't a compliment.

19:53.290 --> 19:55.169
It was premature
self-congratulation.

19:55.170 --> 19:57.119
Terrible.
We analyzed some spreadsheets.

19:57.120 --> 19:58.749
We connected some dots
and lines.

19:58.750 --> 20:01.579
We broke down tactics, but
we didn't show a real victim,

20:01.580 --> 20:03.959
and we're not gonna win
the jury without one.

20:03.960 --> 20:05.329
You taught me that.

20:05.330 --> 20:06.709
She's right. I know she's right.

20:06.710 --> 20:09.119
I'm just not sure what to do.
I know what to do.

20:09.120 --> 20:11.419
You taught me this, too.

20:11.420 --> 20:14.249
These guys will never flip.

20:14.250 --> 20:16.329
They'll never turn
on their family.

20:16.330 --> 20:20.289
Family? What family?
They all hate each other.

20:20.290 --> 20:23.499
What kind of family
kills each other?

20:23.500 --> 20:24.670
Polar bears.

20:26.790 --> 20:31.250
I'm just talking to myself here.

20:32.620 --> 20:34.829
Sand tiger sharks.

20:34.830 --> 20:37.249
Female wolf spiders eat male
spiders during copulation...

20:37.250 --> 20:40.959
You know what? That is really...

20:40.960 --> 20:43.579
helpful.

20:43.580 --> 20:45.419
Thank you
for sitting down with me.

20:45.420 --> 20:46.999
You picked me up
in the produce aisle.

20:47.000 --> 20:48.000
I really didn't have a choice.

20:48.001 --> 20:49.459
I'm Seth Oliver.

20:49.460 --> 20:52.419
Seth Benjamin Oliver.
Two older sisters.

20:52.420 --> 20:53.579
Law school at
the University of Michigan,

20:53.580 --> 20:54.959
and then onto a mid-tier firm.

20:54.960 --> 20:57.119
Not entirely accurate.

20:57.120 --> 20:58.419
How's your mom, Miriam?

20:58.420 --> 21:01.209
Is that, like, a threat?

21:01.210 --> 21:03.459
You people have been harassing
my family for months.

21:03.460 --> 21:06.879
It's only fair I know
a little about you.

21:06.880 --> 21:08.209
Now, listen, Ben...

21:08.210 --> 21:10.209
Seth. You entrapped my husband.

21:10.210 --> 21:11.999
You squeezed some lies
out of him.

21:12.000 --> 21:14.959
He strung you along for a little
bit, but now he's done talking.

21:14.960 --> 21:18.169
Angelo ain't perfect,
but he's a provider,

21:18.170 --> 21:19.329
and he cares for his family,

21:19.330 --> 21:21.210
and he has always
been loyal to us.

21:22.620 --> 21:24.039
Are you kidding?

21:24.040 --> 21:26.039
Karen ain't no
innocent bystander.

21:26.040 --> 21:28.249
We'd run the poker game
in the back of her salon.

21:28.250 --> 21:31.039
She handled the rake, ran the
money through the salon's books

21:31.040 --> 21:33.999
so it came out clean.

21:34.000 --> 21:36.209
I'm sorry.

21:36.210 --> 21:38.619
That can't feel great to hear.

21:38.620 --> 21:41.879
That your husband was willing to
give you up to save himself.

21:41.880 --> 21:45.669
There is no reason
for you to go down

21:45.670 --> 21:49.080
for people who don't
really care about you.

21:50.250 --> 21:53.079
You don't care about me, either.

21:53.080 --> 21:55.919
And those people?
They're my family.

21:55.920 --> 21:57.749
And I'm not a snitch.

21:57.750 --> 21:59.420
So I'll stick
with the devil I know.

22:06.880 --> 22:08.459
We need to talk.

22:08.460 --> 22:10.459
Okay.

22:10.460 --> 22:12.709
Yes.

22:12.710 --> 22:14.420
Not here.

22:16.500 --> 22:18.669
Where did you go
to college, again?

22:18.670 --> 22:20.539
Berkeley.

22:20.540 --> 22:22.499
Did you take philosophy?

22:22.500 --> 22:25.169
I was a history major.

22:25.170 --> 22:27.959
One of the fundamental laws
of logic

22:27.960 --> 22:30.749
is the law of non-contradiction.

22:30.750 --> 22:34.079
Two contradictory statements
cannot both be true.

22:34.080 --> 22:36.919
I am the
Federal Public Defender.

22:36.920 --> 22:40.119
I am in a relationship with the
Chief of the Criminal Division

22:40.120 --> 22:41.330
of the U.S. Attorney's Office.

22:43.460 --> 22:46.419
You were right.

22:46.420 --> 22:50.419
Those two things
cannot both be true.

22:50.420 --> 22:52.040
And yet they are.

22:53.750 --> 22:55.710
They were.

22:58.920 --> 23:00.579
You're young, Sandra.

23:00.580 --> 23:02.459
You have to trust that I know
some things you don't.

23:02.460 --> 23:06.039
And one of those things is that
life doesn't follow axioms.

23:06.040 --> 23:09.459
There's no bright-line
ethical standard.

23:09.460 --> 23:12.419
There are people who do
everything by the book

23:12.420 --> 23:14.499
and are deeply immoral.

23:14.500 --> 23:18.289
There are those who break
all kinds of rules

23:18.290 --> 23:23.249
who are compassionate
and decent and good.

23:23.250 --> 23:25.669
That's true here
in the work we do,

23:25.670 --> 23:27.419
and it's true in the world.

23:27.420 --> 23:29.749
It is complicated.

23:29.750 --> 23:34.539
You asked me who I am?

23:34.540 --> 23:36.919
I am this.

23:36.920 --> 23:39.539
I...

23:39.540 --> 23:41.329
This body.

23:41.330 --> 23:43.539
This person.

23:43.540 --> 23:45.959
We are not our jobs, Sandra.

23:45.960 --> 23:48.959
I know it may feel that way
to you now, but eventually,

23:48.960 --> 23:51.329
even if you never
want anything more,

23:51.330 --> 23:56.460
you will realize
you need something more.

23:57.880 --> 24:00.539
You are a lawyer.

24:00.540 --> 24:03.789
You are the most talented lawyer
I've ever seen in my life.

24:03.790 --> 24:08.169
You are a lawyer.
That is who you are.

24:08.170 --> 24:10.710
But that is not all you are.

24:17.540 --> 24:19.919
Can you please state your name
for the record?

24:19.920 --> 24:22.169
Vera Simmons.

24:22.170 --> 24:23.959
Is this your first time
testifying in court,

24:23.960 --> 24:25.619
Ms. Simmons? Yes.

24:25.620 --> 24:27.209
Are you nervous?

24:27.210 --> 24:29.209
Very.

24:29.210 --> 24:30.499
I understand.

24:30.500 --> 24:32.919
I'm gonna ask you
a few questions,

24:32.920 --> 24:35.329
and you just need to answer
truthfully, okay?

24:35.330 --> 24:37.959
Yes.

24:37.960 --> 24:41.749
I want to draw your attention
to election day.

24:41.750 --> 24:43.459
Yes.

24:43.460 --> 24:44.959
Did you vote?

24:44.960 --> 24:47.959
No.

24:47.960 --> 24:50.749
Why not?

24:50.750 --> 24:52.539
There was a man there

24:52.540 --> 24:55.289
who told us that we were
voting illegally.

24:55.290 --> 24:57.669
That we needed documentation.

24:57.670 --> 24:58.879
Is the man in this photo,

24:58.880 --> 25:01.379
which is marked
as Government Exhibit 38,

25:01.380 --> 25:03.119
the man who was
at the polling place?

25:03.120 --> 25:04.540
Yes.

25:06.960 --> 25:09.709
When he asked you for
documentation, what did you do?

25:09.710 --> 25:11.959
I l-left.

25:11.960 --> 25:14.999
I went home. I was scared.

25:15.000 --> 25:16.619
How long have you been

25:16.620 --> 25:18.749
a United States citizen,
Ms. Simmons?

25:18.750 --> 25:20.789
Seventeen months and two weeks.

25:20.790 --> 25:24.379
This would have been
your first vote in this country?

25:24.380 --> 25:26.959
This would have been
my first vote anywhere.

25:26.960 --> 25:28.880
You never voted in Syria?

25:30.540 --> 25:34.080
I went to the polls one time.

25:36.080 --> 25:39.209
I was 23. I had a newborn.

25:39.210 --> 25:41.249
A boy.

25:41.250 --> 25:44.829
It was a two-hour bus ride
from our home.

25:44.830 --> 25:47.419
I wore nice clothes.

25:47.420 --> 25:50.669
I heard that was what
you were supposed to do.

25:50.670 --> 25:55.039
I might have seen that
on American television.

25:55.040 --> 25:57.249
I waited in line
for three hours,

25:57.250 --> 26:02.329
and then I opened my ballot...

26:02.330 --> 26:06.540
and there was only
one candidate.

26:09.120 --> 26:11.330
One.

26:16.290 --> 26:19.119
I wept.

26:19.120 --> 26:24.670
I remember looking at the face
of my son, and I wept.

26:27.120 --> 26:31.290
A vote is a choice
between two things.

26:33.710 --> 26:35.880
I did not vote that day.

26:38.290 --> 26:41.290
I still have never voted.

26:54.920 --> 26:58.080
Gabe?

27:19.290 --> 27:20.709
What are you doing?

27:20.710 --> 27:23.040
Is that a shoe?

27:24.000 --> 27:25.579
Why are you looking
at those files?

27:25.580 --> 27:26.999
I had to use the bathroom,

27:27.000 --> 27:28.789
and I just saw this stuff
on my way out.

27:28.790 --> 27:30.379
I was curious
how things are going.

27:30.380 --> 27:32.419
How is it going?

27:32.420 --> 27:34.329
You gonna make another run
at Karen?

27:34.330 --> 27:37.119
I... can't talk about the case.

27:37.120 --> 27:39.579
Of course you can't.

27:39.580 --> 27:43.039
I'm gonna post up out here.

27:43.040 --> 27:46.079
Okay.

27:46.080 --> 27:49.079
The Petrinis
are very dangerous people,

27:49.080 --> 27:52.290
capable of heinous things.

27:54.120 --> 27:58.040
I can feel you're getting close.

28:48.210 --> 28:49.620
Thank God!

28:53.380 --> 28:55.459
Gaetano Petrini
would like to say hello.

28:55.460 --> 28:56.750
No.

29:00.290 --> 29:04.879
Dude, drama, drama, drama.

29:04.880 --> 29:06.039
So much drama with you.

29:06.040 --> 29:07.539
You saved my life.

29:07.540 --> 29:08.540
In your dreams.

29:08.541 --> 29:10.289
Is this a dream?

29:10.290 --> 29:12.079
You think I'd do this
in real life?

29:12.080 --> 29:13.459
I might.

29:13.460 --> 29:16.289
I would. We're family.

29:16.290 --> 29:20.879
Now get up.
You've got to talk to Karen.

29:20.880 --> 29:22.420
You're really desperate.

29:24.210 --> 29:26.789
Yes, I am.

29:26.790 --> 29:29.209
I am desperate.

29:29.210 --> 29:32.669
Look, Karen.

29:32.670 --> 29:35.669
I don't know the Petrini family.

29:35.670 --> 29:38.879
I know their names.
I know what they look like.

29:38.880 --> 29:40.249
I know what crimes
they've committed.

29:40.250 --> 29:42.499
I know I want to take them down.

29:42.500 --> 29:46.619
But I don't know them
like you know them.

29:46.620 --> 29:48.829
Like a family.

29:48.830 --> 29:50.749
This is your family.

29:50.750 --> 29:52.919
I'm not gonna try and convince
you to turn on people you love

29:52.920 --> 29:54.669
by telling you all
the bad things they've done.

29:54.670 --> 29:56.459
You know.

29:56.460 --> 29:59.079
I just want to ask
what you think

29:59.080 --> 30:03.080
they would do in your situation.

30:05.790 --> 30:09.959
Would they be as loyal to you
as you are to them?

30:09.960 --> 30:12.169
Are you sure?

30:12.170 --> 30:16.039
Was Angelo?

30:16.040 --> 30:18.419
I don't know the Petrinis,

30:18.420 --> 30:22.039
but I do know that family...

30:22.040 --> 30:25.579
sticks with you no matter what.

30:25.580 --> 30:27.209
Family would
take a bullet for you,

30:27.210 --> 30:29.380
and they know you'd do
the same for them.

30:32.210 --> 30:35.999
Do you really feel that way
about these people?

30:36.000 --> 30:40.959
Are you willing to risk your
son's future on their word?

30:40.960 --> 30:44.289
If so, go with God.

30:44.290 --> 30:50.079
If not, I'm offering you
a way out.

30:50.080 --> 30:52.380
The choice is yours.

30:56.500 --> 30:58.710
I don't know.

31:00.750 --> 31:03.620
Then let's keep talking.

31:07.580 --> 31:12.959
In a few hours, you're going
to go through that door,

31:12.960 --> 31:16.379
you're going to sit down
together,

31:16.380 --> 31:18.539
you're going to
sort through the evidence,

31:18.540 --> 31:20.749
you're going to listen
to each other,

31:20.750 --> 31:23.539
you're going to argue...
You will...

31:23.540 --> 31:24.919
And then you're gonna do

31:24.920 --> 31:27.169
what humans
have done throughout history

31:27.170 --> 31:29.749
to make difficult
and important decisions.

31:29.750 --> 31:32.329
You are going to vote.

31:32.330 --> 31:37.169
We are here
so that you can vote.

31:37.170 --> 31:40.169
Our entire system of justice
is built on this.

31:40.170 --> 31:41.749
Your vote.

31:41.750 --> 31:44.039
So, now, imagine,

31:44.040 --> 31:47.419
you go back into that room,
and someone comes in and says,

31:47.420 --> 31:49.749
"Wait, no. Not you."

31:49.750 --> 31:52.789
No. No. No. No.

31:52.790 --> 31:55.209
No. You can't vote.

31:55.210 --> 31:56.619
He votes.

31:56.620 --> 31:58.709
And him. And him.

31:58.710 --> 32:01.169
And that's it.

32:01.170 --> 32:02.999
That is this case.

32:03.000 --> 32:06.619
Mr. Spiller created
a sophisticated operation

32:06.620 --> 32:09.619
to deprive Americans
of their existential right

32:09.620 --> 32:12.829
to participate
in self-government.

32:12.830 --> 32:16.619
It is flagrantly undemocratic,
but what is so pernicious

32:16.620 --> 32:20.079
and insidious about this
operation is that it pretends

32:20.080 --> 32:23.879
to preserve the democratic
government it undermines.

32:23.880 --> 32:26.789
"We're just rooting out 'fraud.'"

32:26.790 --> 32:29.209
We're just trying to 'protect'
the vote.

32:29.210 --> 32:31.749
"We care about the 'integrity'
of the election."

32:31.750 --> 32:33.789
These are lies.

32:33.790 --> 32:36.329
And these are dangerous lies,
because the greatest threat

32:36.330 --> 32:39.579
to democracy
is making it meaningless.

32:39.580 --> 32:42.579
Hollow.

32:42.580 --> 32:44.499
Dysfunctional.

32:44.500 --> 32:46.289
If you live in an authoritarian
government...

32:46.290 --> 32:48.329
And some of you have,
I'm sure...

32:48.330 --> 32:49.879
There is always the promise
of democracy.

32:49.880 --> 32:51.119
There is hope.

32:51.120 --> 32:53.499
But if appears to be a democracy

32:53.500 --> 32:57.709
and it doesn't work...

32:57.710 --> 33:01.039
what is there left to hope for?

33:01.040 --> 33:05.169
There is here, now,
something left to hope for.

33:05.170 --> 33:07.959
Democracy isn't one story.
It is our story.

33:07.960 --> 33:10.119
Of coming together.

33:10.120 --> 33:14.539
Of building and progress.

33:14.540 --> 33:17.289
Of unity and participation
and representation.

33:17.290 --> 33:20.289
It is a story.

33:20.290 --> 33:23.119
That starts with one person

33:23.120 --> 33:26.709
on one day in one line
pulling one lever.

33:26.710 --> 33:29.329
An ink-stained thumb.
A red pinky.

33:29.330 --> 33:31.289
A paper ticket
in a plastic bucket.

33:31.290 --> 33:33.079
An X. A number. A digit.

33:33.080 --> 33:35.079
A pencil mark. A raised hand.

33:35.080 --> 33:36.459
A voice. A vote.

33:36.460 --> 33:38.709
A choice.

33:38.710 --> 33:44.329
A choice between two things.

33:44.330 --> 33:48.749
And this choice today is yours.

33:48.750 --> 33:54.879
You can continue to tell
this story... our story...

33:54.880 --> 33:57.500
Or you can help end it.

34:09.790 --> 34:12.789
I understand the jury has
reached a unanimous verdict.

34:12.790 --> 34:14.579
Yes, Your Honor.

34:14.580 --> 34:18.418
In the matter of United States
v. Spiller on Count One,

34:18.420 --> 34:20.168
Racketeering, how do you
find the defendant,

34:20.170 --> 34:21.750
guilty or not guilty?

34:25.250 --> 34:27.170
Guilty.

35:21.710 --> 35:22.879
The chair is yours.

35:22.880 --> 35:25.249
We won.

35:25.250 --> 35:29.209
This isn't a win to them.
This is an insurrection.

35:29.210 --> 35:31.039
We are the sovereign district,

35:31.040 --> 35:32.619
and Washington
has never liked that,

35:32.620 --> 35:34.829
but they have lived with it.

35:34.830 --> 35:36.829
They are not gonna
live with this.

35:36.830 --> 35:41.040
This was a direct assault
on their power.

35:43.120 --> 35:45.540
Someone has to pay.

35:46.790 --> 35:48.879
Then someone will.

35:48.880 --> 35:50.539
I have 30 days.

35:50.540 --> 35:53.330
No. Not you.

36:17.170 --> 36:18.999
What are you doing here?

36:19.000 --> 36:21.419
I came to see you.

36:21.420 --> 36:24.419
Personal or professional?

36:24.420 --> 36:26.499
Personal. You shouldn't be here.

36:26.500 --> 36:29.169
They offered me
Acting U.S. Attorney.

36:29.170 --> 36:31.249
What are you talking about?

36:31.250 --> 36:32.619
Washington didn't like
the Spiller case.

36:32.620 --> 36:33.920
They want Delap out.

36:36.000 --> 36:36.960
And what did you say?

36:36.961 --> 36:38.619
I said I was honored.

36:38.620 --> 36:42.119
I said, this is the job
I've wanted my whole life.

36:42.120 --> 36:45.290
I said I love this office
and everything it represents...

36:47.710 --> 36:51.500
but I love the woman
across the street even more.

36:54.920 --> 36:56.919
Roger... I actually
didn't say the last part.

36:56.920 --> 36:58.079
They would have
thought that was weird.

36:58.080 --> 36:59.499
Roger.

36:59.500 --> 37:01.749
I quit, Jill.

37:01.750 --> 37:03.379
I quit.

37:03.380 --> 37:05.879
You didn't. I did.

37:05.880 --> 37:07.289
And I know you're thinking,

37:07.290 --> 37:09.249
"I didn't want you
to quit your job.

37:09.250 --> 37:10.459
I don't want that
responsibility."

37:10.460 --> 37:12.919
I know you're thinking this.

37:12.920 --> 37:15.499
But it's not
your responsibility.

37:15.500 --> 37:17.709
It's mine.

37:17.710 --> 37:20.879
And I don't care if this
all falls apart tomorrow.

37:20.880 --> 37:22.249
I really don't.

37:22.250 --> 37:25.829
We are here now,

37:25.830 --> 37:28.039
and I want five minutes with you

37:28.040 --> 37:30.209
more than I want that chair.

37:30.210 --> 37:32.999
What chair?

37:33.000 --> 37:34.880
Can you kiss me, please?

37:53.880 --> 37:57.459
As most of you have now heard,
Roger Gunn has resigned his job

37:57.460 --> 38:00.669
as Chief of
the Criminal Division.

38:00.670 --> 38:03.330
I'm pleased to announce
his replacement.

38:07.710 --> 38:08.880
Where is she?

38:58.170 --> 39:01.830
We're taking the party
down to Tiny's.

39:07.170 --> 39:10.169
You coming? Yes.

39:10.170 --> 39:11.170
You?

39:11.171 --> 39:14.249
Yes, of course. Of course?

39:14.250 --> 39:16.380
Yeah, I wouldn't miss
something like this.

39:17.750 --> 39:19.329
13 after-work drinks.

39:19.330 --> 39:21.539
4 trivia nights.
2 softball games.

39:21.540 --> 39:22.749
One darts tournament.

39:22.750 --> 39:24.289
You're gonna count
a darts tournament?

39:24.290 --> 39:27.119
We won. Against who?

39:27.120 --> 39:28.670
They appeared to be children.

39:32.330 --> 39:34.539
We should go.

39:34.540 --> 39:37.919
Place is called Tiny's.

39:37.920 --> 39:39.750
We're never all gonna fit.

39:42.540 --> 39:45.119
Sandra.

39:45.120 --> 39:47.119
Ted.

39:47.120 --> 39:50.169
What are you doing?

39:50.170 --> 39:52.540
I'm not neutral on you, either.

39:54.380 --> 39:56.329
Sandra.

39:56.330 --> 39:58.709
You look nervous.

39:58.710 --> 40:01.580
I don't get nervous.

40:04.790 --> 40:08.419
There are some
ground rules here.

40:08.420 --> 40:09.620
Nothing at work.

40:10.710 --> 40:12.459
I will never sacrifice my job
for anything.

40:12.460 --> 40:14.249
Not ever.

40:14.250 --> 40:18.039
You can never ask me
to clean my office.

40:18.040 --> 40:20.039
Never at work.

40:20.040 --> 40:21.540
Now you're just
repeating yourself.

40:25.120 --> 40:28.540
Well, I am a lawyer.
