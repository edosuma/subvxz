00:46.079 --> 00:47.080
Yes.

00:51.685 --> 00:53.320
Yes. All right.

00:55.389 --> 00:56.389
Yeah.

01:03.263 --> 01:04.798
All right. Just relax.

01:05.197 --> 01:07.234
We're fucking here, doing this in Canada.

01:07.301 --> 01:08.335
I'm happy about that.

01:13.373 --> 01:15.776
Look at this crowd. Yo, all right.
I know, uh...

01:16.410 --> 01:18.779
I know I look like a tired eagle. Um...

01:25.819 --> 01:28.588
I don't like how you laughed,
to be honest. It's fine...

01:28.655 --> 01:30.290
It's fine that you laughed at it,

01:30.357 --> 01:32.626
but the way you laughed at it was shitty,
you know?

01:32.826 --> 01:34.494
You laughed like you realized it.

01:36.096 --> 01:38.865
Ha, ha, oh.

01:43.103 --> 01:45.872
Eagles are cool, though. They're fucking...
You know what I mean?

01:46.139 --> 01:47.841
They do that shit.

01:48.508 --> 01:51.244
I don't look like that eagle
that would be like fucking...

01:51.311 --> 01:53.680
I look like an eagle
that would be like this: Caw.

01:53.747 --> 01:57.284
You know what I mean? Like... just tired
as shit, stuck in traffic:

01:57.351 --> 01:58.385
Caw.

02:03.256 --> 02:05.559
I've been thinking about
the way I look a lot lately

02:05.626 --> 02:07.327
because I'm finally the age I look.

02:07.394 --> 02:09.395
I'm like...
I always looked older than I was,

02:09.463 --> 02:11.898
but now I'm 36
and that's a hundred percent obvious.

02:12.165 --> 02:14.835
Like... it's... Like...
Here's what I mean "I'm the age I look."

02:14.901 --> 02:17.537
When I say I'm 36,
nobody in here goes like this:

02:17.704 --> 02:18.805
"No." You know?

02:20.841 --> 02:24.678
Like, I'm an adult. It's fucking crazy
to realize yourself as an adult, right?

02:24.745 --> 02:29.182
I mean, I've been an adult for a while,
but I just kind of... Recently it sunk in.

02:29.249 --> 02:32.786
Here's what happened when I realized it.
I saw a picture, uh, of me

02:32.853 --> 02:34.755
and I didn't recognize me.

02:34.821 --> 02:36.623
I just saw, like, an adult male.

02:37.357 --> 02:40.460
I literally saw me and I thought,
"Fuck that guy. He looks creepy."

02:40.527 --> 02:44.264
That's what I thought. I was like,
"I don't like his whole story. Fuck him."

02:44.698 --> 02:46.900
And then I realized it was me.
I look like that.

02:47.167 --> 02:49.936
I look like a guy that'd fuck your girl
and then be like:

02:50.203 --> 02:51.905
"That's the game."
You know what I mean?

02:53.239 --> 02:54.674
I'm sorry. I didn't do it.

02:57.310 --> 02:58.845
I'm so fucking 36, man.

03:00.313 --> 03:02.816
When I was in my 20s
I was a completely different person.

03:02.916 --> 03:05.452
I don't...
I feel girls say shit like that, actually.

03:05.519 --> 03:08.622
I don't mean it like that.
I feel like girls say dramatic shit like:

03:08.688 --> 03:10.724
"I used to be
a completely different person."

03:12.192 --> 03:15.262
I feel like when a girl says it, it means
she used to fuck a lot, you know?

03:16.763 --> 03:19.433
I feel like when a girl says that,
part of her thinks

03:19.499 --> 03:22.469
that she was someone else for real.
She'll be, "No, for real."

03:22.536 --> 03:24.905
I used to be a little Japanese man,"
or whatever.

03:25.705 --> 03:27.908
Like, "No, you weren't." "Oh, really?

03:29.443 --> 03:30.777
"Then explain this:"

03:32.245 --> 03:34.247
You're like, "Okay, I don't wanna argue."

03:34.314 --> 03:36.349
You were Japanese for a summer
or something."

03:39.986 --> 03:41.988
Ha, ha. I don't mean
I was a different person.

03:42.255 --> 03:43.957
I was a lot different than I am now.

03:44.224 --> 03:45.224
And I was, dude.

03:45.258 --> 03:46.393
Just take ten years ago.

03:46.460 --> 03:49.262
When I was 26 I was married,
which is crazy.

03:49.463 --> 03:52.632
Which... And that's true.
But by the way, don't do that. Uh, yeah.

03:53.767 --> 03:56.870
I don't bad-mouth marriage.
You can get married and it can work out,

03:56.937 --> 04:00.240
but not if you're 26 and a dude.
That's way too young, okay?

04:00.407 --> 04:02.976
I mean, maybe some of you are 26
and married out there,

04:03.243 --> 04:05.312
in which case, oops,
but you know what I mean?

04:05.779 --> 04:07.447
It's not gonna work out, you know?

04:07.881 --> 04:10.417
I mean, it might, but it won't.
You know what I mean?

04:10.517 --> 04:12.519
But it could,
but it's not going to, right?

04:12.886 --> 04:16.555
But some are like, "This one's special."
And you're wrong, but, uh...

04:17.357 --> 04:20.360
Yeah, you're not special.
You're just somebody.

04:21.661 --> 04:23.830
That's fucked up.
We're not special at all.

04:23.897 --> 04:24.897
That's so fucked.

04:29.703 --> 04:30.703
We're not.

04:30.804 --> 04:32.739
We're not special. We're just people.

04:32.939 --> 04:35.375
It's fucked up to think about, right?

04:35.509 --> 04:37.887
I know when I say that
I lose some people in the audience.

04:37.911 --> 04:39.713
They're like, "Well, yeah, I mean..."

04:41.314 --> 04:46.720
"Speak for yourself, but... I'm special
'cause I bought a vest a week ago."

04:46.787 --> 04:48.989
Or whatever the fuck you think
makes you special.

04:49.956 --> 04:52.559
Of course we think we're special.
We live in a society

04:52.626 --> 04:54.795
that fucking makes us feel that way,
right?

04:54.861 --> 04:56.863
We're all individuals and shit, right?

04:56.930 --> 04:59.833
Well, we... People told us that
ever since we were little kids.

04:59.900 --> 05:03.737
Your parents or if you had shitty parents,
your teachers told us that shit, right?

05:03.970 --> 05:07.674
I had a teacher that used to be like,
"Remember, you're your own snowflake."

05:08.875 --> 05:12.512
As a 4-year-old, you're like, "Okay,
I'm a little bit of snowflake, I guess."

05:12.579 --> 05:13.980
Like, that's weird as shit.

05:16.750 --> 05:18.451
And you carry on the tradition.

05:18.518 --> 05:20.687
We fucking make... You... You got kids,

05:20.754 --> 05:23.056
you make them feel special,
you lie to them. You do.

05:23.323 --> 05:25.992
You say shit like, "You can do anything
you put your mind to."

05:26.593 --> 05:27.994
What the fuck? No, you can't.

05:28.428 --> 05:31.665
No. No, you can't. No, you can't. No.

05:31.731 --> 05:34.534
So many things you can't do
even if you put your mind to it.

05:34.601 --> 05:35.969
Most things you can't do.

05:36.036 --> 05:38.438
A lot of you guys
couldn't even get here on time.

05:45.378 --> 05:46.513
Things are hard as shit.

05:46.580 --> 05:49.115
We can all do, like, four or five things,
tops.

05:49.616 --> 05:51.718
We try things,
but halfway through we're like:

05:51.785 --> 05:53.486
"Fuck it, I'm hungry." And we quit.

05:53.853 --> 05:55.989
We give up 'cause shit is hard as fuck.

05:56.656 --> 05:58.425
I'm wrong about this?

05:58.491 --> 06:02.095
You can do anything you put your mind to.
Really? Shit out of your eyes. Do that.

06:03.496 --> 06:05.498
Try it. Do it.
Fucking put your mind to it.

06:06.866 --> 06:08.802
Try every day for the rest of your life.

06:08.868 --> 06:11.671
It'll always come out
of your asshole first every single time.

06:11.738 --> 06:14.040
This is you every day.
"Back to the drawing board."

06:14.107 --> 06:17.577
That's you every day
with a high dry cleaning bill

06:17.644 --> 06:18.845
'cause you shit your pants.

06:22.015 --> 06:23.516
We're not special.

06:24.117 --> 06:25.719
But of course you feel that way.

06:25.785 --> 06:28.665
I saw some of you walk in here tonight.
You're like, "Fucking here I am."

06:30.824 --> 06:33.059
You only think that 'cause you're you.
That's why.

06:33.393 --> 06:36.930
If you were someone else, might be like,
"Fuck that guy. I don't like his vest."

06:40.000 --> 06:42.969
That's the problem, really,
is that you've always only been you.

06:43.036 --> 06:45.772
That's the problem.
You've never been anyone else, right?

06:45.972 --> 06:48.575
So, you're important
'cause you live inside your body.

06:48.642 --> 06:50.043
You're looking out of your eyes.

06:50.477 --> 06:52.779
And if someone pokes you, you're like,
"Fucking hey."

06:55.548 --> 06:57.784
"Don't make me start a hashtag on Twitter."

07:01.021 --> 07:03.890
You know how you know
that we think we're special? Because...

07:03.957 --> 07:06.159
Here's why. 'Cause movies make money.
That's why.

07:06.426 --> 07:09.095
'Cause we think we're special.
'Cause we'll sit in the theater

07:09.162 --> 07:11.965
and watch Denzel Washington
and be like, "You know what?"

07:12.032 --> 07:14.167
Fucking that's me.

07:15.535 --> 07:17.671
I'm fucking Denzel in my life.

07:17.737 --> 07:19.873
If my life were a movie,
I will be the lead.

07:19.940 --> 07:22.075
"I'm the Denzel Washington part."

07:22.142 --> 07:24.577
No, you're not the fucking
Denzel Washington part.

07:24.644 --> 07:28.014
What part you are? Denzel Washington
walks up to you like, "Where is she?"

07:28.081 --> 07:31.084
And then you go like this, "I don't know."
That's you.

07:33.019 --> 07:36.022
You think you're Denzel?
Think you walk into a room full of cops

07:36.089 --> 07:39.526
with a bunch of confidence and swagger?
Just like "So, what do we got?"

07:39.592 --> 07:41.227
No. That's what Denzel does.

07:41.494 --> 07:44.497
You're the guy afterwards
with a bunch of graphs and spreadsheets

07:44.564 --> 07:46.084
and you're like, "Uh, excuse me, sir."

07:46.132 --> 07:49.202
I... I... I have a bunch of facts
that pertain to the case ahead."

07:49.469 --> 07:52.505
And he's like, "Shut the fuck up!"
And you go: "Oh, Oh!"

07:53.006 --> 07:55.942
And the spreadsheets fly everywhere,
you bitch ass. That's you.

08:00.747 --> 08:02.515
You're not fucking Denzel.

08:02.916 --> 08:05.518
You think you are?
You think you're the man on fire?

08:05.585 --> 08:06.786
Is that what you think?

08:06.853 --> 08:09.089
You think you walk out of a car
in slow motion

08:09.155 --> 08:11.091
with the music blaring in the background?

08:13.994 --> 08:17.063
No. When you get out of your car,
the music stops.

08:17.797 --> 08:19.833
'Cause it was on the radio in your car.

08:20.867 --> 08:22.268
You don't get out on a mission

08:22.535 --> 08:25.572
with a beautiful dove
flying out of your backseat.

08:26.006 --> 08:29.743
And the wind casually flipping
your Hawaiian shirt up, exposing your abs.

08:29.809 --> 08:31.911
You don't even have abs, you fat fuck.

08:33.813 --> 08:34.847
You don't get out like:

08:36.982 --> 08:38.150
You get out and it's like:

08:39.919 --> 08:41.921
Fat. Fat fuck.

08:42.722 --> 08:45.125
Fuck a dove. There's a pigeon at best.

08:45.725 --> 08:48.528
And it's fatter than you are.
Can't even get off the ground.

08:48.595 --> 08:50.997
It's eating Doritos out of your car
when you got out,

08:51.064 --> 08:52.699
you fucking piggy fat fuck.

08:54.934 --> 08:55.934
Yeah!

08:56.936 --> 08:57.936
You're not...

08:58.238 --> 08:59.606
You're not Denzel.

08:59.839 --> 09:01.207
You're not the man on fire.

09:01.875 --> 09:04.677
You think you are. A lot of you think
I'm talking about other people.

09:05.078 --> 09:07.180
You are other people to other people.

09:08.648 --> 09:12.052
You think you're the fucking man.
You think that's your movie, you fucking...

09:12.118 --> 09:16.556
You think if someone pulled a gun on you,
you might, "Do it. Come on, motherfucker."

09:16.623 --> 09:19.159
Let's see what you got.
Come on, show me the balls you got."

09:20.660 --> 09:23.329
No way. Neither would I.
I'm not saying I'm better than that.

09:23.763 --> 09:26.299
Here's me or anybody in here
if we got a gun pulled on us.

09:26.566 --> 09:27.700
This is what we would do:

09:29.269 --> 09:31.137
"Take my girl, take my girl.

09:32.005 --> 09:33.873
You can fuck her."

09:38.278 --> 09:39.712
You're not Denzel.

09:39.779 --> 09:43.616
You're not the man on fire. Right?
Life's not your movie,

09:43.683 --> 09:45.919
that's what I'm trying to say.
Makes sense, right?

09:45.985 --> 09:49.656
You know what life is more like?
We're all extras in someone else's movie.

09:49.722 --> 09:52.292
That's what it's more like, right?
And you guys believe me.

09:52.358 --> 09:54.761
You're like, 70, 75 percent there.
You're like:

09:54.828 --> 09:58.231
"Well, yeah,
I mean... Chris D'Elia is right,

09:58.298 --> 10:04.137
"but... also, ha, ha...
I'm a little bit Denzel." Right?

10:05.338 --> 10:08.608
You know what that is? That's your ego.
That's... I have that, too.

10:08.675 --> 10:10.944
I have that ego.
You live life like it's your movie

10:11.010 --> 10:13.613
because you don't wanna be
the bitch-ass extra, right?

10:13.680 --> 10:15.715
I certainly...
I orchestrate my life that way.

10:15.782 --> 10:17.984
I feel like I'm the lead of my movie
right now.

10:18.051 --> 10:21.387
I'm on-stage yelling into a microphone
at you guys.

10:21.654 --> 10:23.656
I'm like,
"It's like this. It's like that."

10:23.756 --> 10:26.626
You guys are all looking back at me like,
"Yeah, he's right."

10:27.160 --> 10:29.129
It feels like it's my movie, but it's not.

10:29.195 --> 10:32.065
In real life, the movie
is probably about a couple arguing.

10:32.132 --> 10:34.167
And the girl gets so mad
that she storms out.

10:34.234 --> 10:37.704
And this is just a scene at the Vogue
in fucking Vancouver, Canada.

10:41.374 --> 10:42.374
Yeah.

10:43.343 --> 10:45.678
I'm not even Chris D'Elia in this movie.

10:45.745 --> 10:47.113
I'm comedian number six.

10:49.282 --> 10:50.316
But you try, right?

10:50.383 --> 10:51.784
You try 'cause you have to.

10:52.051 --> 10:53.720
You try to make life yours, right?

10:53.786 --> 10:56.756
Life throws what it throws you
and you roll with the punches.

10:56.823 --> 10:58.424
That's what happened to me, you know?

10:58.691 --> 11:02.095
I met a girl and I hung out with her
for too long, and then...

11:03.129 --> 11:07.000
Then I loved her. By the way,
that's what love is. That's what it is.

11:07.066 --> 11:09.769
Hanging out with someone for too long.
That's what it is.

11:10.003 --> 11:12.739
It's true. Fuck these movies.
They glorify love.

11:12.805 --> 11:14.974
Two people in the rain,
looking at each other,

11:15.041 --> 11:18.077
not giving a shit it's raining
'cause they're holding eye contact.

11:18.144 --> 11:20.213
Right?
They're just like, "I fucking love you."

11:20.280 --> 11:22.282
Ah. You're my soul mate.

11:22.348 --> 11:24.217
I'm so lucky I found you.

11:24.284 --> 11:26.152
Why am I the one that's so lucky?

11:26.219 --> 11:28.855
"I can't belie... I miss you when I blink."

11:36.162 --> 11:38.231
"Where did you go?"
"Oh, I was just blinking."

11:39.766 --> 11:41.968
That's not what people say
as it starts raining.

11:42.035 --> 11:45.071
You know what people say?
No matter how much in love they are,

11:45.138 --> 11:47.774
no matter how much eye contact,
this is what we say:

11:47.840 --> 11:50.176
"Hey. Ah. Let's go inside."
That's what we say.

11:51.210 --> 11:53.146
Love is not that certain.

11:54.080 --> 11:57.283
If I could pick two words that love is,
it's right here: "I guess."

11:58.818 --> 12:01.354
Love is "I guess."
You find yourself your "I guess" person

12:01.421 --> 12:03.856
and have an "I guess" family.
That's what you do.

12:03.923 --> 12:07.226
And then you "I guess" your way
all throughout life. That's what you do.

12:07.293 --> 12:11.297
You say, "Yeah, let's get married,
I guess, and then have kids, I guess",

12:11.364 --> 12:15.001
and feed them,
I guess, uh... every day, I guess.

12:15.068 --> 12:17.136
And take a trip if we have the money,
I guess.

12:17.203 --> 12:20.106
And when I'm sick, make me soup
if you're in the mood, I guess.

12:20.173 --> 12:22.976
And then when you die,
I'll be right by your side.

12:23.042 --> 12:27.180
"I guess. I don't know. That's so far away.
At this point, I hope I go first."

12:35.221 --> 12:36.422
Love is "I guess."

12:36.823 --> 12:39.392
If you're sure you're not in love,
that's not what love is.

12:39.459 --> 12:41.995
Think about the people in your life
that knew they were in love.

12:42.061 --> 12:44.130
Think about those people.
"I fucking love her."

12:44.197 --> 12:46.866
Hundred percent know it.
I knew it as soon as I saw her.

12:46.933 --> 12:49.535
You can't convince me otherwise.
She's so easy to be around.

12:49.802 --> 12:51.304
"She's basically me."

12:52.205 --> 12:55.485
Right? And then a year later you're like,
"How is she?" "Oh, that bitch was crazy."

12:57.010 --> 12:59.112
'Cause that's not love.
That's <i>The Notebook</i>.

12:59.178 --> 13:01.814
That's <i>Jerry Mc-fucking-Guire,</i> okay?

13:01.881 --> 13:03.549
And those movies ended early.

13:03.950 --> 13:06.953
They were two hours, not 40 fucking years.

13:08.254 --> 13:10.390
You know I'm right.
That's why you're laughing.

13:10.456 --> 13:14.027
'Cause you've been in love or are now,
and know that love is up and down.

13:14.093 --> 13:17.397
And up and down and up and down
and down more and down

13:17.463 --> 13:19.799
and up a little bit,
but then down, down, down.

13:19.866 --> 13:22.802
Down, down, not up, down, down, down.

13:23.202 --> 13:26.539
And you're both stuck down there and like,
"At least we have each other."

13:26.806 --> 13:27.806
That's what love is.

13:28.574 --> 13:31.110
And then you meet other couples
down there

13:31.177 --> 13:33.379
and you, like, do dinners with them
or some shit.

13:33.946 --> 13:35.214
Fuck those dinners.

13:35.481 --> 13:37.884
A lot of you guys
are probably on those dinners right now.

13:42.355 --> 13:46.025
A lot of you guy... Look, sometimes
people think what I'm saying is negative

13:46.092 --> 13:47.560
because I'm saying love is shitty.

13:47.827 --> 13:50.863
But that's not negative
that love is shitty. You know why?

13:50.930 --> 13:54.033
'Cause love is shitty because it fucking
has to be. You know why?

13:54.100 --> 13:56.903
Because it's awesome, too.
That's how everything in life is.

13:56.969 --> 14:00.273
Everything that's good is equally
that bad. That's yin and yang of life.

14:00.339 --> 14:02.408
Take anything you like.
It's equally that bad.

14:02.475 --> 14:04.911
Kit Kats. You love Kit Kats, right?
Eat them up.

14:04.977 --> 14:06.379
"Oh, man, I love these Kit Kats."

14:06.446 --> 14:08.948
Oh, they're so chocolatey.
Break me off another one.

14:09.015 --> 14:12.051
"I love these Kit Kats.
Why are they so good?" They are, until:

14:13.519 --> 14:15.455
That's the bad part. That's the bad part.

14:15.521 --> 14:17.457
You're sitting on the toilet, thinking:

14:17.523 --> 14:20.560
"Oh, man, I can't ever eat
any more Kit Kats ever again."

14:20.960 --> 14:24.364
It's the same thing as love. Chipotle,
Chipotle, Chipotle. Love, love, love.

14:24.430 --> 14:25.598
Love is Chipotle.

14:25.865 --> 14:27.600
Dude, this isn't even a comedy show.

14:27.867 --> 14:29.535
It's a fucking TED Talk, okay?

14:36.476 --> 14:37.476
Oh, fuck it.

14:40.179 --> 14:42.148
Love is shitty. And that's okay.

14:42.548 --> 14:46.386
Sometimes if... If you're with somebody,
you go to sleep shitty and wake up shitty.

14:47.320 --> 14:49.522
And by the way, you sleep shitty, too.
Sometimes.

14:50.189 --> 14:51.924
If you don't wake up every two hours

14:51.991 --> 14:56.195
and think something like "did this bitch
turn off the humidifier?" that's not love.

14:57.930 --> 15:01.401
And then you wake up with chapped lips
and blame each other. That's love.

15:02.068 --> 15:04.670
You're like, "Yo, did you turn
this shit off? What the fuck?"

15:06.506 --> 15:09.409
You did... My...
Side of my mouth is cracking now...

15:10.076 --> 15:14.180
when I open it like that. The bad side.
What the fuck? You didn't turn it off.

15:14.247 --> 15:18.084
You didn't turn it off. Who came in here?
Humidifier fairy came and did that shit?

15:18.151 --> 15:20.620
"My mommy came over at 2:30 in the morning
and did that?"

15:27.527 --> 15:30.630
That's what love is. Know what love is?
If I could distill love down

15:30.696 --> 15:34.167
into one moment, this right here
would be the moment of love right here.

15:34.300 --> 15:36.035
"Fucking move."

15:39.372 --> 15:40.439
Move over.

15:40.506 --> 15:43.409
Look at the other side of the bed.
Look at that area. Look at that...

15:43.476 --> 15:45.978
Stop gazing into my fucking eyes
for two seconds

15:46.145 --> 15:47.680
and look at the other area.

15:47.947 --> 15:50.216
And then look at this zero area
I've got over here.

15:50.349 --> 15:52.218
Look at that vast area.

15:52.285 --> 15:55.188
They shot <i>Mad Max</i>
on the other side of you.

15:55.988 --> 15:58.108
Tom Hardy's over there
on the front of a vehicle like:

15:59.492 --> 16:02.562
And I'm over here with my leg
and my dick flopped off the bed.

16:02.628 --> 16:05.331
Explain that. Explain why my dick
is flopped off the bed.

16:05.398 --> 16:09.101
They shot <i>Mad Max </i> and <i> Dances With Wolves</i>
on the other side of you.

16:10.269 --> 16:14.073
Kevin Costner's over there
with a water buffalo just like:

16:15.374 --> 16:16.375
He's saying that.

16:22.114 --> 16:24.584
Every time you turn, you take the covers.
You know that?

16:24.650 --> 16:26.752
Every time you turn, you take it.
You take it.

16:27.019 --> 16:29.288
I'm there and you're sleeping,
but you're dreaming.

16:29.355 --> 16:31.057
'Fuck him.
He doesn't deserve them.'

16:31.123 --> 16:33.993
And you take it and you take it
and you take it.

16:34.060 --> 16:37.196
And you do a billion revolutions a night.
You take it, you take it.

16:37.330 --> 16:41.100
And when you come back, you leave it.
You take it and then leave it over there.

16:41.167 --> 16:44.437
You take it and then leave it.
You're like a shitty fucking typewriter.

16:44.504 --> 16:46.072
You're a typewriting-ass bitch.

16:46.138 --> 16:47.740
And I'm over here with no covers.

16:48.007 --> 16:51.143
A frigid, freezing cold dick
and my mouth is bleeding.

16:51.210 --> 16:52.278
"Thank you, bitch."

17:01.420 --> 17:02.555
That's what love is.

17:04.223 --> 17:06.092
Know what love is? This is what love is.

17:06.157 --> 17:08.461
When you're on an airplane
with your girl or whoever

17:08.528 --> 17:11.063
and they're next to you
and you have a thought like:

17:11.130 --> 17:13.398
"Does she really think that the armrest
is for her?"

17:14.400 --> 17:15.401
Fucking come on.

17:15.468 --> 17:17.502
It's my turn a little bit sometimes. Fuck.

17:18.304 --> 17:20.606
Come on. You know what?
Put your fucking head

17:20.673 --> 17:22.241
against the side of the plane.

17:22.308 --> 17:25.377
I gave you the window seat for a reason.
Use it.

17:25.444 --> 17:28.114
Well, I'm trying to be fucking chivalrous.
God.

17:33.486 --> 17:35.688
"Time to kick back and relax."

17:44.230 --> 17:46.832
Right? You're freezing,
but she's got your hoodie balled up,

17:47.099 --> 17:48.200
using it as a pillow.

17:48.601 --> 17:50.069
And you gotta be happy about it.

17:50.136 --> 17:53.306
You're like,
"Ah, I hope you're comfortable."

17:53.673 --> 17:55.641
And you're, like,
going to visit her family

17:55.708 --> 17:57.410
in, like, Dallas or some shit

17:57.610 --> 18:01.247
and then she was like,
"Do you wanna go because you wanna go...

18:01.781 --> 18:05.518
or do you wanna go
because you know that I want you to go?"

18:12.291 --> 18:15.227
"You know what?
You're asking me to lie to you."

18:16.295 --> 18:18.831
I wanna go 'cause I wanna go. How's that?

18:19.131 --> 18:22.201
Yeah. I don't even care if you're going
at this point. I am. Uh-huh.

18:22.401 --> 18:25.438
Can we stay with your grandma?
And is she 93 years old?

18:25.504 --> 18:27.807
Can I not understand a word
coming out of her mouth?

18:27.873 --> 18:30.276
And does she only wear nightgowns
even at 3 p.m.?

18:30.343 --> 18:33.846
"And are her bathrooms weird as shit?
Sign me up."

18:34.747 --> 18:37.817
Aw.

18:40.453 --> 18:43.489
Dude, bro, I'll get so mad on the plane.
Like... And I'll fucking...

18:43.556 --> 18:46.258
I'll make myself hot.
I'll turn on the a... Fuck that air,

18:46.325 --> 18:49.195
the little air-conditioning, the...
The little bitch-ass air.

18:49.261 --> 18:52.498
Make a bigger vent. Make a bigger vent.
It's a hole. Use less material.

18:54.233 --> 18:57.303
You're using more material
to be a big fucking dickhead on purpose.

18:57.370 --> 19:00.272
Make a little... Gotta turn it on.
It's like a fucking titty.

19:00.339 --> 19:01.907
You know what I mean? You turn it on.

19:02.174 --> 19:04.343
It's not even cool air.
It's just loud air.

19:04.744 --> 19:08.214
You turn it on
and it's, like fucking rocketed

19:08.280 --> 19:09.348
in my eye.

19:09.415 --> 19:10.616
Four thousand miles, please.

19:10.683 --> 19:12.585
Just in this circumferenced area.

19:12.652 --> 19:13.652
Just in this area.

19:13.753 --> 19:17.623
This is where I'm hot, actually.
Right here, I'm freezing already, okay?

19:17.690 --> 19:19.325
But here, I'm tropical.

19:19.392 --> 19:23.362
Fucking dry out my contact lens, please.
When I get to the Dallas airport,

19:23.429 --> 19:26.298
I wanna walk around like this.
That's how I wanna walk around.

19:26.365 --> 19:30.236
I want people to think they see Fetty Wap
in baggage claim. That's what I want.

19:31.470 --> 19:32.571
That's what love is.

19:32.638 --> 19:36.742
Walking around the Dallas airport
with three bags and one good eye.

19:37.476 --> 19:40.880
And she's skipping in front of you
with no bags and two eyes.

19:41.514 --> 19:44.216
And you told her to pack one bag.
And you packed one bag,

19:44.283 --> 19:46.719
but somehow you're holding three!

19:48.320 --> 19:51.323
That's not what the man on fire does.

19:58.664 --> 20:00.232
Whatever. So, you know.

20:01.767 --> 20:03.602
I asked her to marry me.

20:05.504 --> 20:07.506
I mean, I didn't mean to...
Well, I meant to.

20:07.573 --> 20:10.409
I meant to... I meant...
I meant to say the words, you know?

20:10.476 --> 20:13.245
But... I don't know,
now that I have some retrospect on it,

20:13.312 --> 20:15.881
it's ten years later,
I think the reason why I did it

20:15.948 --> 20:18.751
is because I thought
it was the right thing to do, you know?

20:18.818 --> 20:20.619
It was an idea that I had, right?

20:20.886 --> 20:24.724
Like, my parents are still married.
Now, even. They're my role models, right?

20:24.790 --> 20:28.294
But I didn't mean it when I said it from...
Didn't mean it from the bottom

20:28.360 --> 20:29.360
of my heart, right?

20:29.395 --> 20:32.765
When you ask somebody to marry you,
you gotta fucking mean that shit.

20:32.898 --> 20:38.804
You gotta hunker down and just fucking,
you know... "Hey." Right?

20:39.405 --> 20:44.376
"Just want you to know...
life can be crazy sometimes.

20:44.443 --> 20:47.580
But you, you make sense of it all."
Or whatever.

20:47.646 --> 20:49.891
Whatever Creed song you wanna rip off,
you know? But...

20:54.887 --> 20:58.557
I didn't ask from the bottom of my heart,
you know? I didn't. I just not...

20:58.624 --> 21:01.460
I said it with my mouth.

21:02.294 --> 21:05.698
Can't do that. You can't ask somebody
to marry you from your fucking mouth.

21:05.765 --> 21:08.501
Just fire it out there like,
"Meh. You wanna get married?"

21:08.567 --> 21:10.736
You know what I mean?

21:11.670 --> 21:12.872
Not like ordering a bagel.

21:12.938 --> 21:16.008
You can order a bagel from your mouth.
Doesn't matter, right?

21:16.275 --> 21:18.477
You can just be like,
"Meh, what bagels you got, sir?

21:19.378 --> 21:22.481
It doesn't matter if I don't like it.
I'll just order another one."

21:22.815 --> 21:24.583
That's not what marriage is, right?

21:26.352 --> 21:29.321
To further my point, don't order a bagel
from the bottom of your heart.

21:29.388 --> 21:33.058
That'd be very weird. Different feelings,
different situations. Right?

21:33.459 --> 21:36.695
Like, if you walked into a bagel place
and you were, like, fucking,

21:37.329 --> 21:38.329
"Hey."

21:38.764 --> 21:40.833
Excuse me, bagel guy.

21:41.867 --> 21:43.402
I want you to...

21:44.470 --> 21:47.473
I want you to know
your bagels are my everything.

21:48.374 --> 21:50.543
"So, can I have an everything bagel?"

21:50.976 --> 21:53.012
Right? Corny, that's my whole point.

21:59.418 --> 22:03.355
So, we did it. We got married and I...
But I didn't... I didn't real...

22:03.422 --> 22:05.057
I don't know. I knew something was up.

22:05.324 --> 22:07.993
I didn't know I didn't wanna be married,
but something was up.

22:08.060 --> 22:10.563
I was too young
to realize my own emotions.

22:10.663 --> 22:12.798
Like, I was frustrated, right?
Like, I was...

22:12.865 --> 22:15.668
I'd take it out on wrong things
'cause I didn't know myself.

22:15.734 --> 22:18.871
Like, I'd be eating a sandwich
and be like, "Know what? Fuck turkey."

22:18.938 --> 22:20.840
Or some shit. She'd be, "What's wrong?"

22:20.906 --> 22:23.642
I'd be like, "You don't know me!"
I was becoming a dick.

22:24.710 --> 22:26.712
Here's how I knew
I didn't wanna be married.

22:26.779 --> 22:30.015
This kept happening. Didn't realize then,
but I realize now, all right?

22:30.082 --> 22:32.685
It's very symbolic.
You know when you live with someone

22:32.751 --> 22:34.753
and walk into a room
and they're in the room

22:34.820 --> 22:37.056
and it ends up scaring the shit
out of you, right?

22:37.122 --> 22:39.625
Though it's the one thing
that should be in that room,

22:39.692 --> 22:40.926
'cause it's their room, too,

22:40.993 --> 22:42.995
you're not thinking,
you're doing something else.

22:43.062 --> 22:46.031
You walk in and it scares you.
That kept happening, okay?

22:46.098 --> 22:48.500
I kept walking in different rooms
she would be in

22:48.567 --> 22:52.104
and getting the shit scared out of me.
I'd walk in and be like, "What the fuck?"

22:52.371 --> 22:54.840
Whoa, where did you come from?
How did you get here?"

22:54.907 --> 22:56.976
She'd be like, "I fucking live here."

22:57.109 --> 22:59.712
You're like,
"I know. I get scared because deep down...

22:59.778 --> 23:03.382
"Deep down I don't want you here. Deep down
I don't want you here." Whatever.

23:03.449 --> 23:05.618
Mistakes are scarier than monsters.

23:15.794 --> 23:18.864
That's the other thing, right?
Don't wanna let yourself get scared.

23:18.931 --> 23:20.599
Not as a young man, right?

23:20.666 --> 23:23.836
Like, not in your 20s. Don't wanna...
You wanna be the man, right?

23:23.902 --> 23:26.438
Like, for instance,
if somebody scares your friend

23:26.505 --> 23:28.440
and they go, "Boo." And he goes:

23:30.576 --> 23:33.879
That dude's a bitch, right?
Like, he's not gonna be in your army.

23:33.946 --> 23:37.416
I mean, you don't have an army,
but if you did, and some shit went down,

23:37.483 --> 23:41.053
you'd give him the flute. And he'd be
the bitch ass in the back... just:

23:41.120 --> 23:44.490
"Don't shoot me. It's not...
I'm just here for morale." Right?

23:45.190 --> 23:46.925
"That's not fair."

23:48.927 --> 23:50.195
That's against the rules.

23:50.929 --> 23:52.431
"Shoot the guys with the guns."

23:57.002 --> 23:59.805
On the other hand,
if you scare your friend and you're like:

23:59.872 --> 24:02.741
"Boo." And he's like,
"Come on, motherfucker, let's do this."

24:02.975 --> 24:04.076
Give him a gun.

24:04.576 --> 24:07.079
He should be out there
guarding the flute bitches, right?

24:08.614 --> 24:11.150
I didn't wanna be a flute bitch.
Not in front of my girl.

24:11.216 --> 24:14.687
There's no fucking way I was that secure
in myself. There's no way.

24:14.753 --> 24:17.189
So, I'd walk in
and I'd get scared she was in the room.

24:17.456 --> 24:20.225
But I couldn't let her see that.
So, I'd immediately cover it up

24:20.492 --> 24:22.861
and just get mad at her
for even being in the room.

24:23.128 --> 24:25.964
I'd walk in and just,
"Hey. Ow. What the fuck are you doing?"

24:26.031 --> 24:28.934
Look at the way you're sitting
with knees up. You a gargoyle?

24:29.001 --> 24:30.001
"Fuck off."

24:40.045 --> 24:42.815
So... now I'm 36.

24:43.115 --> 24:44.950
It's ten years later. I'm a man.

24:45.017 --> 24:49.054
Can't fucking do something 'cause I think
it's the right thing to do or it's...

24:49.121 --> 24:52.157
It's what I should do.
Gotta do something so I... 'Cause it's me.

24:52.224 --> 24:54.193
I'm exactly that guy
in that picture I saw.

24:54.259 --> 24:56.662
Thirty-six-year-old fucking...
A man, right?

24:56.895 --> 24:59.832
But I vowed recently
not to pretend anymore because of that.

24:59.898 --> 25:03.001
Like... And I've been good at it.
I took a stand recently.

25:03.068 --> 25:05.838
Here's something I don't wanna pretend
to do anymore.

25:05.904 --> 25:08.707
A lot don't agree,
but I don't wanna pretend to wanna go

25:08.774 --> 25:10.943
to your party anymore.
I don't wanna go, okay?

25:11.076 --> 25:13.879
I've been to so many parties,
had fun zero times, all right?

25:14.980 --> 25:17.249
Don't wanna go anywhere
where I'm in a conversation

25:17.516 --> 25:20.686
and I catch myself going like this: "Ah."
I don't wanna go.

25:23.255 --> 25:26.125
People are boring as shit at parties.
They'll just say shit

25:26.191 --> 25:28.660
that they think is interesting,
not giving a shit about you.

25:29.094 --> 25:32.831
I was at a party once and this guy
looked me in the eyes and says this:

25:33.665 --> 25:36.602
"Hey, do you know anything
about front lawns?"

25:41.774 --> 25:44.777
'Cause I was thinking
about redoing my front lawn, you know?

25:44.843 --> 25:46.678
"Might just redo the whole thing."

25:48.013 --> 25:50.115
Ah.

25:50.215 --> 25:53.552
"I'm gonna rip my dick off in the corner.
Yeah. No, it'll hurt,"

25:53.619 --> 25:56.789
but at least I'll have to deal
with something else immediately, right?

25:56.989 --> 25:59.825
Hey, I'd love to sit and chat
about your fucking lawn,

25:59.892 --> 26:03.228
but... gotta deal
with this dick situation.

26:03.862 --> 26:05.631
"It's off."

26:11.970 --> 26:13.338
I don't wanna go to your party.

26:13.739 --> 26:15.207
I don't wanna pretend to wanna go.

26:15.641 --> 26:18.310
Here's something I definitely
don't wanna pretend I wanna do.

26:18.577 --> 26:21.747
I don't wanna pretend to wanna go
to your fucking birthday party. No.

26:21.814 --> 26:23.782
I don't care. What did you turn, 28?

26:23.849 --> 26:25.350
Bye. Do it by yourself. Don't care.

26:25.617 --> 26:28.620
I'm Jehovah's Witness from now on.
For real. I'm not celebrating.

26:30.189 --> 26:32.724
If you're 9, have a birthday party.
That's okay.

26:32.791 --> 26:35.194
But if you're 10, get a job immediately.

26:36.161 --> 26:38.931
That's what I think. You go to work.
And you don't want to.

26:38.997 --> 26:42.835
That's the world I wanna live in. That's...
Where 10-year-olds have to go to work.

26:43.135 --> 26:46.705
I wanna see them fucking just like,
"Hey, guys. Sorry, I'm late for work."

26:46.772 --> 26:51.810
Like... "I only got... Sorry, I only got
this many hours of sleep last night."

26:54.813 --> 26:57.683
Hey, guys. First order of business.

26:58.217 --> 27:00.686
First order of business.
Need to get these products

27:00.752 --> 27:02.287
to upper management, pronto.

27:03.322 --> 27:05.891
Hello, Stacy,
can you please bring in my Capri Sun?

27:05.958 --> 27:07.192
It's going to be a long one.

27:08.727 --> 27:12.097
And can you put the straw in the back,
please? I never know how to do that.

27:13.398 --> 27:17.769
Hey, guys. Before we get started...
where is the employee bathroom?

27:18.837 --> 27:20.138
"I got to go caca now."

27:25.310 --> 27:28.013
If you're 9, have a birthday party.
That's your last one.

27:28.981 --> 27:32.417
Okay? My buddy came up to me
this year and he goes like this.

27:32.684 --> 27:34.953
First of all, he's 42, okay? Forty-two.

27:35.387 --> 27:37.656
As in, almost dead.

27:38.290 --> 27:39.290
Okay?

27:39.892 --> 27:43.896
And he comes up to me and he goes
like this, "Hey, man. Guess what."

27:45.364 --> 27:49.735
First of all, don't do "guess what" to me,
okay? I'm 36. It's not cute anymore.

27:50.068 --> 27:52.871
What am I supposed to be like? Oh, ah!

27:54.439 --> 27:57.242
"No, don't give me any hints.
I wanna figure it out myself."

28:00.712 --> 28:02.080
It could be anything.

28:03.181 --> 28:06.218
If you do "guess what,"
from now on this is my guess. Purple?

28:06.285 --> 28:09.421
That's what it is. If it's not purple,
fucking tell me immediately.

28:09.688 --> 28:11.690
Save time. We're both adults. Okay?

28:13.992 --> 28:17.162
The guy goes like this,
"Uh, no, not purple. Um..."

28:19.932 --> 28:21.400
I'm turning 42 soon.

28:22.067 --> 28:24.002
"You gonna come to my birthday party?"

28:24.703 --> 28:28.240
In my heart I'm already like, "Fuck
this guy" for even asking, all right?

28:28.373 --> 28:32.010
But in my head, as I'm trying to mull
a polite way to decline the invitation,

28:32.077 --> 28:36.214
I realize I'm already going like this
in the guy's face, "No."

28:36.281 --> 28:37.883
Right in his face.

28:38.183 --> 28:39.451
"No..." It felt good.

28:39.718 --> 28:41.386
It felt like the real me was coming out.

28:41.453 --> 28:43.355
It felt freeing like, "No."

28:43.422 --> 28:45.757
It felt like I sang it, for real,
right in his...

28:45.824 --> 28:47.125
♪ <i>No, I won't go ♪</i>

28:47.426 --> 28:50.229

28:52.931 --> 28:53.965

29:45.450 --> 29:47.252

29:47.919 --> 29:49.454
That's such a "fuck you," you know?

29:49.521 --> 29:51.523
It really is.
You want that extra high note.

29:51.790 --> 29:54.059
But some motherfuckers
don't give that shit to you.

29:54.426 --> 29:55.460
You know what you want.

29:55.527 --> 29:56.862

29:56.928 --> 29:58.163

29:59.798 --> 30:01.433
♪ <i>Meet me somewhere el... ♪</i>

30:01.500 --> 30:04.303
And they're like,
"Fuck you. You don't get that last note."

30:04.503 --> 30:07.105
The balls you've gotta do to do that shit.

30:12.844 --> 30:16.448
I don't wanna go to your party, dude.
What the fuck? Birthday party? Come on.

30:16.515 --> 30:19.251
I gotta get you a gift? Why?
What happened? What? Nothing.

30:19.484 --> 30:21.453
You just waited. That's all that happened.

30:21.987 --> 30:25.223
You didn't die. And I gotta, like,
buy you a VCR or some shit?

30:26.358 --> 30:28.827
That's what I get everybody every year
from now on.

30:28.894 --> 30:30.962
You're getting a fucking VCR
if you invite me.

30:31.897 --> 30:33.865
"Yeah, did you want that, motherfucker?

30:35.100 --> 30:36.468
I bet you did at one point."

30:41.473 --> 30:45.143
Ah, man. Fuck it. That's another thing
I don't wanna pretend to have to do, is...

30:45.210 --> 30:48.547
Is like the gift that you got me
on my birthday. Right?

30:48.613 --> 30:52.117
If you came to my party
and you gave me a gift that I didn't like,

30:52.184 --> 30:53.385
know me better, friend.

30:53.952 --> 30:56.855
That's your fault, right?
'Cause that's about the other person.

30:56.922 --> 30:59.591
Gotta make sure they feel okay
about the gift they got, right?

30:59.925 --> 31:03.462
You gotta open it up like, "What? No way."

31:04.029 --> 31:06.298
How did you know
I wanted this specific thing

31:06.365 --> 31:10.435
even though I never said it out loud,
even when I was alone?

31:11.069 --> 31:13.338
"And also, I don't."

31:17.409 --> 31:21.146
Thought about no-gift thing 'cause here's
what happened when I turned 35, okay?

31:21.213 --> 31:24.916
My buddy bought me the gayest gift
you could buy another heterosexual male.

31:25.050 --> 31:27.986
You know what he bought me?
He bought me pants. Yeah.

31:29.121 --> 31:31.189
Think about this.
How could you be a grown man

31:31.256 --> 31:32.924
and buy another grown man pants

31:33.091 --> 31:35.660
without seeming like
you suck all the dicks, okay?

31:36.361 --> 31:37.396
Here's the gay part.

31:37.462 --> 31:39.264
They fit fantastic.

31:41.333 --> 31:44.469
I don't even know how he knew my size.
I don't even know my own size.

31:44.536 --> 31:46.371
I always have to try pants on.

31:46.505 --> 31:49.574
This dude literally eyeballed my hips.

31:50.542 --> 31:52.611
And he was like, "Looks like a 33."

31:52.677 --> 31:54.579
And he fucking nailed it, okay?

31:55.147 --> 31:56.448
That's gay.

31:57.382 --> 31:58.517
It's gay.

31:59.084 --> 32:00.919
And by the way, that's what I mean.

32:00.986 --> 32:02.254
I mean, it's gay.

32:02.387 --> 32:04.556
I mean, it's gay, all right?

32:05.223 --> 32:07.159
Saying it twice 'cause I wanna clarify.

32:07.225 --> 32:09.261
I want you guys to know that I mean it,
okay?

32:09.327 --> 32:12.097
'Cause people get real sensitive
when you use that term.

32:12.164 --> 32:14.633
Right? They'll be like,
"You know what? That's not cool

32:14.699 --> 32:17.636
to use that word in a derogatory manner."

32:18.136 --> 32:20.305
Yeah, I 100 percent agree with you.

32:20.372 --> 32:22.140
I don't mean it in a derogatory way.

32:22.207 --> 32:25.577
I mean, it's gay like fucking a guy, okay?

32:27.345 --> 32:31.450
Buying your friends pants that fit
is gay like fucking a guy.

32:31.516 --> 32:32.551
And that's okay.

32:32.617 --> 32:35.153
Fuck guys all day long, yippee.

32:35.220 --> 32:36.955
But it's gay like that, okay?

32:38.957 --> 32:39.958
It's so gay, I think.

32:46.998 --> 32:49.968
I actually think it's gayer
than fucking a guy. I do. I do.

32:50.035 --> 32:53.338
I think buying your friend's pants
that fit and wrapping them

32:53.405 --> 32:58.109
and waiting to give it to him
is way gayer than just fucking him.

32:58.176 --> 32:59.176
I think that.

32:59.411 --> 33:01.179
I a hundred percent made up my mind.

33:01.246 --> 33:03.181
I've thought about this a lot, obviously.

33:03.582 --> 33:05.183
You can't convince me otherwise.

33:06.117 --> 33:09.120
You know why it's gayer
to buy your friend's pants that fit

33:09.187 --> 33:12.557
than it is to fuck him?
Because fucking a guy is easy.

33:12.624 --> 33:14.426
That's why it's less gay.

33:14.493 --> 33:15.560
It's so easy.

33:15.627 --> 33:18.229
I mean, you could fuck a guy
even if you're not gay.

33:18.330 --> 33:22.033
Relax. You don't have to,
but... you could, right?

33:22.100 --> 33:26.304
Like, you can't build a restaurant
if you're not a fucking architect, right?

33:26.371 --> 33:28.039
Like, here, look, let me explain.

33:28.106 --> 33:29.140
Um...

33:29.207 --> 33:32.644
If I held a gun to your head...
Don't need a skill set is what I'm saying.

33:32.711 --> 33:35.313
You don't need a skill set
to fuck a guy, right?

33:35.380 --> 33:40.785
If I held a gun to your head and I said,
"Fucking, are you an architect?" And...

33:42.654 --> 33:46.191
Okay, wait.
And you were like, "No," right?

33:46.391 --> 33:48.793
And I was like,
"Well, you better build me a restaurant

33:49.494 --> 33:51.630
or I'm gonna blow
your fucking brains out."

33:52.230 --> 33:56.167
You'd have to be like,
"Tell my family I love them."

33:57.636 --> 34:01.673
But if I held that same gun to your head
and I said, "Are you gay?"

34:02.073 --> 34:03.642
And you were like, "No."

34:04.075 --> 34:06.144
And I said, "Well, you better fuck a guy"

34:06.378 --> 34:08.413
or I'm gonna blow
your fucking brains out."

34:08.480 --> 34:11.583
You'd be like, "Where is he?"

34:15.520 --> 34:16.755
That's how easy it is.

34:18.489 --> 34:21.092
That's how easy...
That's why it's less gay in my head.

34:21.159 --> 34:24.228
Like, fuck... But, dude,
buying a friend's pants that fit

34:24.295 --> 34:28.266
and wrapping them... and knowing the size,
that's not easy. That's difficult.

34:28.400 --> 34:29.400
That takes time.

34:29.534 --> 34:30.802
Gay time, okay?

34:33.071 --> 34:34.172
It's a gay adventure.

34:34.239 --> 34:35.540
It's a gay fucking errand.

34:35.607 --> 34:37.641
There's levels of gayness to it.

34:37.708 --> 34:40.378
Like, look.
Look, okay, I'm not gay, all right?

34:40.445 --> 34:43.848
Never had sex with a guy even once.

34:44.114 --> 34:47.185
Sounds funny to say it like that.
Still means the same thing. But...

34:51.656 --> 34:56.293
However,
sometimes I'm so tired and so lazy

34:56.428 --> 34:58.663
that if somebody came up to me
and they were like:

34:58.730 --> 35:01.666
"Hey, man...
do you wanna buy your friend's pants"

35:01.733 --> 35:06.304
that fit and wrap them and give them
to him at his party for his birthday...

35:07.405 --> 35:08.573
or...

35:14.179 --> 35:16.448
"Do you wanna
just, like, fuck this guy right here?"

35:16.815 --> 35:18.450
I might be like:

35:21.486 --> 35:23.221
"I mean, he's right here.

35:23.788 --> 35:25.657
I don't have to go to the car for that."

35:26.725 --> 35:30.328
It's so easy and that's why it's less gay.
Dude, it's so easy to fuck a guy.

35:30.395 --> 35:33.565
Could practically fuck a guy by mistake.
That's how... Not practically.

35:33.632 --> 35:36.868
You actually could.
It's very unlikely, don't worry. But...

35:37.135 --> 35:40.572
I don't mean the mistake where you're,
"Sorry, I thought it was a woman."

35:41.239 --> 35:43.375
I mean, like, literally a mistake like...

35:43.508 --> 35:44.609
How? Okay, here's how.

35:44.676 --> 35:49.748
Um... All right, so...
if you were to walk into a room

35:49.814 --> 35:52.350
with your hard dick already out, okay?

35:52.550 --> 35:54.819
So far, every dude's on board, right?
Uh...

35:56.154 --> 36:01.359
And... And in the room,
the floor is really slippery, okay?

36:04.663 --> 36:08.333
And on the floor
there's one dude face down...

36:08.900 --> 36:11.269
and he's just spreading his asshole.

36:11.836 --> 36:14.239
Even if you slip,
you'll probably catch yourself.

36:14.305 --> 36:16.341
You'll be like,
"Whoa, that was a close one."

36:16.474 --> 36:19.411
But there's a chance you could fall
the other way and be like, "What? No."

36:19.477 --> 36:22.313
Boink. Whoopsie.
You fucked him by mistake, okay?

36:24.616 --> 36:30.689
But there is no way in hell
that you can slip and fall

36:30.855 --> 36:32.957
and buy your friend's pants that fit.

36:35.293 --> 36:38.196
No matter how wet Macy's is,
it just can't happen.

36:38.363 --> 36:40.598
It's impossible. It won't happen.

36:47.272 --> 36:49.908
You can't. You can't be like,
"Whoa, hey, wait a minute."

36:49.974 --> 36:51.376
Those are cool pants.

36:51.843 --> 36:53.678
Do you have them in a size 33?

36:53.878 --> 36:55.547
Oh, I'll take them. Thanks.

36:55.613 --> 36:58.717
"Hopefully I slip all the way over
to your Gift Wrapping Department."

37:07.792 --> 37:10.462
So, the pants fit good, you know?
And, uh...

37:11.596 --> 37:14.566
But here's what happened.
So, my buddy called me, uh...

37:14.999 --> 37:17.602
who bought me the pants,
he called me two weeks after.

37:17.669 --> 37:20.972
And he called me up and was like,
"Hey, man, wanna get a cup of coffee?"

37:21.239 --> 37:24.342
And I was like, "Fuck, yeah,
I'll drink that shit right now, player."

37:24.909 --> 37:27.846
I'm a G about my coffee.
I don't give a fuck, man.

37:28.313 --> 37:31.416
"Put your fucking caffeine
where your mouth is, coz."

37:35.420 --> 37:37.422
So, I went
to go meet him for coffee, right?

37:37.489 --> 37:40.391
And as soon as I hung up the phone,
I left my house.

37:40.458 --> 37:42.861
As soon as I got to my own door,
I realized I wasn't...

37:42.994 --> 37:45.330
I wasn't wearing the pants that he got me,
okay?

37:45.396 --> 37:48.833
I didn't want the first time for him
to see me since he got me the pants

37:48.900 --> 37:51.803
to show up and not be wearing the pants,
right?

37:51.870 --> 37:55.907
'Cause then he would spot me and be like,
"Hey, what's up? Aw."

37:56.674 --> 37:57.942
And then that made me be like:

38:00.044 --> 38:01.379
So, I changed pants.

38:01.446 --> 38:04.015
I literally put on a cuter outfit
to meet a dude, okay?

38:04.549 --> 38:06.484
That's gay as shit. So...

38:08.686 --> 38:12.791
Now I got the pants on
and, um, I show up to the coffee shop

38:12.857 --> 38:16.494
and I see him and he sees me
and he goes like this, "Hey, what's up?"

38:16.561 --> 38:17.662
Oh!

38:17.762 --> 38:18.797
And that made me go:

38:20.331 --> 38:21.666
Fuck this asshole.

38:21.966 --> 38:24.035
He's controlling my life with pants.

38:24.536 --> 38:25.837
It's pants control.

38:28.306 --> 38:31.709
So, now I'm uncomfortable. I'm like,
"Let's just get this over with," right?

38:31.910 --> 38:34.813
So, we get the coffee, uh,
we walk out to the patio.

38:34.879 --> 38:37.882
I'm with the dude who bought me the pants.
I'm wearing the pants.

38:37.949 --> 38:39.684
We're having a conversation, coffee.

38:39.751 --> 38:43.354
And as we're doing this,
a girl walks out of the coffee shop

38:43.421 --> 38:46.090
and she spots me and she actually says:

38:46.457 --> 38:49.460
"You know what?
Those are some really cool pants."

38:50.862 --> 38:54.098
I'm like, "Oh, cool." At least
I get to talk to a girl about it, right?

38:54.365 --> 38:57.435
My buddy leans in and says,
"You know, I bought them for him."

39:00.505 --> 39:02.507
That's way gayer than just fucking him.

39:08.112 --> 39:11.349
That's what happens when you pretend.
That's what happens. Right?

39:11.416 --> 39:13.818
You get in a situation
you're not prepared to deal with

39:13.885 --> 39:16.020
'cause you're not being you.
That's what I did.

39:16.087 --> 39:19.591
When he bought me pants and I opened them,
I should've said how I felt.

39:19.657 --> 39:22.527
I should've been like, "How did you know
my size, you fucking weirdo?"

39:23.728 --> 39:27.498
Instead I was like, "Oh, cool pants.
I'll wear them next time I see you."

39:28.533 --> 39:31.035
I played the game
and then the game played me.

39:34.038 --> 39:37.642
Yup. But it's hard, though, it is.
It's hard to not pretend.

39:37.709 --> 39:40.078
It's hard to know who you are
in any given situation

39:40.144 --> 39:41.813
and not pretend ever, right?

39:41.880 --> 39:44.449
Like, we all do it.
We all pretend in moments.

39:44.515 --> 39:47.018
We all think we matter more
than we actually do. Right?

39:47.085 --> 39:49.721
We all think we're special,
but we're not. Right?

39:50.021 --> 39:52.891
You know the worst people nowadays
that think they matter more

39:52.957 --> 39:54.893
than they actually matter, hands-down?

39:54.959 --> 39:57.428
People that work out
and won't shut the fuck up about it.

39:57.495 --> 39:58.830
I cannot stand that shit.

39:59.030 --> 40:02.700
Bang, bang, bang, click, click. Reload.
Bang, bang, bang, I can't stand it.

40:03.167 --> 40:06.104
Work out, go home.
You don't matter that much, okay?

40:06.938 --> 40:09.807
All this inspirational culture
that's going around,

40:09.874 --> 40:13.011
this fitspo lifestyle
that they're trying to convince you of.

40:13.077 --> 40:15.780
Who are you inspiring?
That's what I want to know. Right?

40:15.914 --> 40:19.017
These dudes will be like, "You know what?
I used to weigh 90 pounds",

40:19.083 --> 40:23.721
but now, through hard work, determination,
perseverance, never backing down,

40:23.788 --> 40:26.991
not stopping, remaining focused,
never veering off track,

40:27.058 --> 40:32.697
not looking over my shoulder, never dying,
no days off,

40:32.764 --> 40:35.833
"now, I got bigger muscles." Okay.

40:36.701 --> 40:39.437
You know what? Eat dicks. Okay?

40:40.939 --> 40:42.573
Eat all the dicks you see around.

40:43.207 --> 40:45.743
If you're like that, if you see a dick,
you eat that shit.

40:45.810 --> 40:47.170
Like that.

40:47.812 --> 40:48.947
Like a log trimmer, just:

40:50.548 --> 40:52.228
With dick chips
spinning out of your mouth:

40:54.686 --> 40:57.021
Throw a dick up
and just swallow it whole.

40:57.188 --> 40:59.924
Where there's a dick outline in your neck,
muscle it down.

40:59.991 --> 41:02.493
That's your new workout, okay?
Eat dicks, of course.

41:07.165 --> 41:09.500
Like, you're not really doing much, okay?

41:09.767 --> 41:13.104
Who the fuck are you inspiring?
You're not running for political office.

41:13.571 --> 41:14.939
You're not joining the Army.

41:15.006 --> 41:18.509
All you do is move weight around
and eat extra chicken, right?

41:20.044 --> 41:23.247
You like protein? Cool.
There's protein in my dick. Eat it.

41:25.817 --> 41:28.486
You work hard?
Congratu-the fuck-lations.

41:28.553 --> 41:29.587
I work hard, too.

41:29.654 --> 41:32.056
I don't hashtag it "blessed" all day long.

41:32.824 --> 41:33.958
Eat my dick.

41:35.626 --> 41:38.730
These guys are so self-involved.
It's so fucking annoying.

41:39.230 --> 41:42.600
They're ridiculous. They'll take a selfie
in the mirror and be like:

41:42.667 --> 41:44.902
"Keep your friends close
and your enemies closer."

41:46.738 --> 41:51.209
No. Not really, man. You know why?
You're not a warrior. That's why. Okay?

41:51.642 --> 41:54.512
You just, like, have a job
at the movie theater or some shit.

41:54.579 --> 41:57.749
Keep your friends real close.
See movies with them. It works out fine.

41:58.516 --> 41:59.717
You don't rule the nation.

42:05.023 --> 42:06.891
Fucking, they're ridiculous, these guys.

42:07.725 --> 42:10.261
They're just ridiculous.
"You know, I... Well, I've... Hey."

42:10.528 --> 42:14.632
Just so you know...
life is a journey, okay?

42:15.566 --> 42:17.301
It's not about the destination.

42:18.102 --> 42:22.874
"It's about the tools you use...
and the path you take."

42:24.709 --> 42:28.046
Oh, really? I didn't know I was dealing
with the Dalai fucking Lama, dude.

42:32.784 --> 42:34.285
"You know, don't be afraid to..."

42:36.020 --> 42:38.156
"Don't ever be afraid
to reach your dreams."

42:38.222 --> 42:39.891
Oh, cool, man.

42:41.092 --> 42:44.262
"Don't ever fucking be afraid
to make your dreams a reality..."

42:45.029 --> 42:46.564
and succeed, you know?

42:49.967 --> 42:52.170
I used to be a shell of a man, but now...

42:54.872 --> 42:57.041
Now I know exactly
what's inside that shell.

42:58.643 --> 43:01.179
All equal parts that make me me.

43:02.146 --> 43:04.115
"Don't ever be afraid of being you."

43:04.215 --> 43:07.885
You know what my favorite one is?
"Just be you. Everyone else is taken."

43:08.019 --> 43:09.253
Fuck that shit.

43:13.357 --> 43:17.862
"Hard work, determination, perseverance,
never backing down, not stopping,"

43:17.929 --> 43:20.998
remaining focused, never quitting,
fighting the desire,

43:21.065 --> 43:24.235
but also following the desire,
never looking over your shoulder,

43:24.302 --> 43:27.171
fucking, army of one, no days off.

43:27.238 --> 43:29.207
Rome wasn't built in a day.

43:30.007 --> 43:34.045
Buildings, robots, carpet, iPa..."
You're just saying words, okay?

43:34.112 --> 43:37.048
You like words? Here's more. Eat my dick.
There's three.

43:46.090 --> 43:49.393
Like, who the fuck are you inspiring?
That's what I wanna know. I wanna...

43:49.660 --> 43:54.198
That's what I wanna know.
I wanna know what guy sees that guy...

43:54.866 --> 43:56.767
and then gets inspired.

43:59.670 --> 44:02.707
Right? Like, what guy sees a poster
with, like, a whale's tail

44:02.773 --> 44:06.644
breaching out of the ocean
and the word "perseverance" under it?

44:07.945 --> 44:09.981
Hmm.

44:20.992 --> 44:22.326
Let's think hard about that.

44:25.329 --> 44:29.066
What guy sees a bunch of birds
lined up on a tree branch

44:29.300 --> 44:31.736
and thinks "teamwork"?

44:34.272 --> 44:37.375
Like, what guy scrolls through
that Instagram post and is like:

44:37.441 --> 44:39.377
Whoa.

44:40.912 --> 44:43.781
You ever think about that?
You ever think about perseverance?

44:43.848 --> 44:46.918
You ever think about that?
You ever think about taking no days off?

44:46.984 --> 44:50.922
You ever think about how you could do more
if you didn't take any days off?

44:50.988 --> 44:54.859
Ever think about how you're an army of 1?
'Cause you're not more than other people?

44:54.926 --> 44:58.062
You ever think about how Rome
wasn't built in a day?

44:58.129 --> 45:01.766
You ever think about
maybe it took a few days to build Rome?

45:03.067 --> 45:05.303
Nobody. You're not...
You're not inspiring anybody.

45:05.369 --> 45:07.038
You know why? You know how I know?

45:07.104 --> 45:08.839
'Cause never in the history of man

45:08.906 --> 45:11.709
has any dude looked
at another guy's fit body and been like:

45:11.776 --> 45:14.979
"Wow, that guy's in shape.
I'm gonna create Microsoft."

45:15.046 --> 45:16.781
That's never fucking happened, okay?

45:16.914 --> 45:18.082
So, eat dicks.

45:22.853 --> 45:27.191
See, that's what happens.
That's what happens when you lie to kids.

45:29.226 --> 45:31.963
That's what happens.
When you look at kids and you say:

45:32.029 --> 45:33.998
"You can do anything
you put your mind to."

45:34.999 --> 45:37.501
You get the motherfucker
that grows up and believes that.

45:37.802 --> 45:39.870
He's like,
"Fucking time to change the world."

45:39.937 --> 45:40.937
Here we go.

45:41.238 --> 45:45.209
Ta, ta, ta, ta, ta, ta.

45:47.445 --> 45:50.247
Let's cure world hunger. Let's try
to cure world hunger. Here we go.

45:55.252 --> 45:56.821
"Less people hungry yet?"

45:59.256 --> 46:00.291
Don't lie to kids.

46:00.825 --> 46:03.861
Right? I mean, I don't know.
That's how I feel, though. Fuck that.

46:03.928 --> 46:05.196
I don't have any kids yet,

46:05.262 --> 46:07.865
but when I have my first kid
and that dude comes out,

46:07.932 --> 46:11.268
no way I'm saying, "You can do anything
you put your mind to." No way.

46:11.369 --> 46:13.838
Gonna look him in the eyes.
First thing I say is:

46:13.904 --> 46:15.773
"You're gonna fail a lot. Aah!"
And run away.

46:17.108 --> 46:19.043
"Life's full of hardships, buddy.

46:20.244 --> 46:23.848
Your first hardship is try and find me."
Pyoom! And just fucking...

46:30.521 --> 46:32.823
Fucking, pyoom, so fast that papers

46:32.890 --> 46:34.959
are floating to the ground
like in the cartoons.

46:35.459 --> 46:37.228
I arrive at my next destination like:

46:47.938 --> 46:50.841
What do I know? I'm saying
don't lie to kids. I have zero kids.

46:50.908 --> 46:53.210
I have zero boys, zero girls.
That equals zero.

46:55.446 --> 46:59.083
I've been thinking about it,
why I don't have kids... you know, yet.

46:59.150 --> 47:01.919
And I think, really, honestly,
the answer is

47:02.186 --> 47:05.322
if I'm being honest like I said I would,
I wouldn't pretend, and...

47:05.389 --> 47:08.392
But more importantly,
if I'm being honest and not pretending

47:08.893 --> 47:12.563
the reason why I don't have kids yet
is because I'm scared,

47:12.830 --> 47:16.367
but more importantly,
it's because I'm selfish, man. For real.

47:17.068 --> 47:18.569
Like, I mean, but that's the thing.

47:18.836 --> 47:21.105
You could be who you want
when you don't have kids.

47:21.172 --> 47:22.940
It doesn't matter that much, right?

47:23.074 --> 47:27.445
Like, if you have a kid looking up at you
that... As a role model,

47:27.511 --> 47:30.147
you gotta fucking take charge and do shit,
right?

47:30.481 --> 47:31.482
But I don't have to.

47:31.549 --> 47:35.419
Like, a lot of you guys fucking have kids
at home, right? And you left them.

47:35.486 --> 47:38.255
You were like, "Bye, guys.
We'll be back later," you know?

47:39.056 --> 47:42.426
And they were like, "Okay, can't wait
to see you when you get back." Right?

47:43.494 --> 47:46.363
You're thinking about them when
you're laughing. You're like: "Ha, ha."

47:46.430 --> 47:48.899
In your head you're like,
"I have a kid," you know?

47:49.867 --> 47:50.901
That doesn't leave you.

47:51.969 --> 47:54.171
For me, I'm selfish as shit.
I leave the house,

47:54.238 --> 47:56.006
I don't fucking have to tell anybody.

47:56.373 --> 47:57.651
Sometimes I pretend. I'm like,

47:57.675 --> 48:00.277
"Bye, guys, see you later.
Ha, ha. You don't exist." I leave.

48:05.082 --> 48:06.484
Having kids changes who you are.

48:06.550 --> 48:08.695
It doesn't mean it changes who you are
for the worse.

48:08.719 --> 48:12.089
It changes who you are for the better.
But still, fuck that shit.

48:12.323 --> 48:14.191
I don't wanna be better. I wanna be me.

48:15.192 --> 48:18.195
You can do... Be whatever you want.
In my heart, honestly,

48:18.262 --> 48:20.598
I'm fucking cold sometimes,
and it's okay.

48:20.664 --> 48:22.533
Bad mood? I don't have to watch myself

48:22.600 --> 48:25.035
'cause I don't have a kid
looking up at me, right?

48:25.302 --> 48:28.205
It doesn't matter. I could be looking
at the guy at the gym.

48:28.272 --> 48:29.507
"You don't matter that much.

48:29.573 --> 48:32.476
And fucking, no, I won't come
to your 42nd birthday party."

48:33.210 --> 48:35.913
In my heart,
I'm gangster as shit sometimes.

48:35.980 --> 48:38.482
Sometimes I look outside of my house
in my neighborhood

48:38.549 --> 48:40.217
and I think, in this voice:

48:40.284 --> 48:42.553
"You know what?
The streets is real out here."

48:43.120 --> 48:46.056
And I know it to be true in my heart,
okay?

48:46.457 --> 48:49.293
If I had a little kid looking up at me
every single day,

48:49.360 --> 48:51.095
that would change who I was.

48:51.162 --> 48:53.497
Just like, "Hey, Dad,
what are we going to do today?"

48:54.231 --> 48:57.201
"Yo, man, why you looking at me
with them angel eyes, player?"

48:57.601 --> 48:59.203
Trying to keep the streets real.

48:59.270 --> 49:01.305
And you're softening a motherfucker up,
dawg.

49:02.273 --> 49:03.541
Fuck y'all, man.

49:03.607 --> 49:06.177
Making me emotional.
Go to your room, player. Now.

49:07.378 --> 49:09.346
"Fucking hard as shit up in this bitch."

49:12.116 --> 49:15.553
Having kids changes who you are,
for the better. Fuck it.

49:17.354 --> 49:20.524
It happened to my buddy. He used
to be my best friend. Now he's a dad.

49:22.560 --> 49:25.429
That's how selfish I am.
I can't even have a best friend dad.

49:25.629 --> 49:27.598
I can't.
I get jealous of the kid for real.

49:27.665 --> 49:30.401
I'll be like, "You've known me
for nine years. She's 4."

49:30.467 --> 49:32.102
How do you explain your loyalty?"

49:37.374 --> 49:41.045
He'll be, "I took her to the park."
I'll be, "You never took me to the park."

49:43.547 --> 49:45.683
"I would... I would have driven you, so..."

49:47.218 --> 49:49.453
It's interesting. It's really interesting.
Really.

49:49.587 --> 49:52.056
"I'm not mad, I just... I'm interested.
I'm not mad."

49:57.561 --> 49:59.530
Yeah, man,
he had this fucking little girl.

49:59.597 --> 50:01.732
This little daughter girl.
This little fucking...

50:03.200 --> 50:06.503
She's 4 years old. They live in Texas,
so, I haven't met them yet. Right?

50:06.570 --> 50:09.340
Met them recently,
but not when he called me up 'cause he...

50:09.406 --> 50:12.376
I live in L.A. He called me and was like,
"Hey, enough's enough."

50:12.443 --> 50:15.279
I want you to meet my baby girl.
She's 4 already and...

50:15.346 --> 50:18.182
"We're coming out to L.A.
Are there hotels we could stay at?"

50:18.249 --> 50:21.118
And I just spoke immediately.
I said, "No, stay at the house."

50:21.185 --> 50:23.020
I didn't even mean it. I just said it

50:23.087 --> 50:25.756
'cause, like, I heard my dad say it
once growing up, you know?

50:26.023 --> 50:27.524
You're like, "I'm an adult now."

50:27.591 --> 50:30.027
I even heard my dad's
East Coast accent come out.

50:30.094 --> 50:32.505
I was like,
"Yeah, guys, come on over."

50:32.529 --> 50:35.569
It was like a fucking
Olive Garden commercial or something.

50:35.632 --> 50:38.644
"Yeah, when
you're here, you're family. Come on over."

50:38.668 --> 50:41.537
There's unlimited breadsticks
at the house."

50:45.676 --> 50:48.212
And they came over
and that fucking... That...

50:48.279 --> 50:51.615
I mean, that little girl was directly
trying to affect how real I keep it

50:51.682 --> 50:53.083
on these streets, you know?

50:54.485 --> 50:57.121
She was looking at me
all cute and soft and shit.

50:57.187 --> 51:00.124
First of all, her name is Anika,
which is like, that's so cute.

51:00.190 --> 51:01.258
Fuck that, right?

51:01.625 --> 51:04.795
I'm like, "How am I supposed
to keep it real and call this girl Anika?"

51:05.062 --> 51:08.165
Fuck that. I'm gonna call her Rachel.
That's a regular-ass name."

51:10.200 --> 51:12.770
But you can't call a 4-year-old girl
a different name.

51:12.836 --> 51:14.672
That would fuck her up for life.

51:15.172 --> 51:18.542
Imagine her talking to her dad later on
just like, "Hey, Dad, excuse me."

51:18.609 --> 51:20.844
I have a question for you.
Hey, Dad, excuse me.

51:21.111 --> 51:24.782
Can I talk to you for a second?
Hey, Dad, can I talk to you for a second?

51:25.316 --> 51:29.186
Hey, Dad, how come your friend that looks
like the guy from <i>Sleepy Hollow,</i>

51:29.253 --> 51:30.320
why does he...?

51:32.156 --> 51:35.125
"Dad, excuse me.
Can I talk to you for a second? Hey, Dad."

51:35.359 --> 51:38.629
Why do little girls grab their pussies
from behind? That's so weird.

51:38.696 --> 51:41.131
Don't go weird like I made them do it.

51:41.198 --> 51:44.435
That was Jesus Christ our Lord and savior
that made them do that, okay?

51:44.501 --> 51:47.571
If he did anything, he did everything,
including that, all right?

51:47.838 --> 51:50.240
He did it, like, on the eighth day
or some shit.

51:51.175 --> 51:54.611
"And on the eighth day, little girls
will grab their pussies from behind."

51:55.412 --> 51:58.215
And even... And even the disciples
were like, "Whoa, already?"

51:58.282 --> 52:02.119
Like, we can do that later." He was like,
"It's what I thought of now. No order.

52:02.186 --> 52:03.320
We'll get them all done."

52:06.190 --> 52:09.493
And then he made lakes or whatever.
"Hey, Dad. Excuse me, Dad."

52:09.560 --> 52:13.364
I have a question for you. Hey, Dad.
Can't you see I have a question for you?

52:13.430 --> 52:16.142
Can I talk to you for a second?
Can you be done with that right now?

52:16.166 --> 52:19.770
Hey, Dad. How come your friend
that looks like a cool, young Bob Saget,

52:19.836 --> 52:20.836
why does he...?

52:22.206 --> 52:23.907
And he knows it. Why does he...?

52:25.209 --> 52:27.878
And he hates when people say that
on Twitter. Why does he...?

52:31.348 --> 52:32.716
Why does he call me Rachel?

52:34.418 --> 52:35.586
My name is Anika.

52:36.720 --> 52:37.855
Am I Rachel, too?

52:39.223 --> 52:41.158
I want to buy a bunny and then kill it.

52:43.260 --> 52:46.330
"Anika loves bunnies, but Rachel doesn't."

52:46.397 --> 52:48.799
You know what I mean?
That's how that probably happens.

52:50.801 --> 52:52.736
So... Thank you.

52:53.404 --> 52:57.174
So, now I gotta call this girl Anika
against my better gangster judgment.

53:01.612 --> 53:02.780
They showed up, man.

53:03.480 --> 53:06.183
They showed up and stayed with me.
'Cause I invited them.

53:06.250 --> 53:07.251
That's how that works.

53:08.819 --> 53:09.820
And they showed up.

53:09.887 --> 53:15.426
And when they showed up, uh, my buddy,
or Ryan, the dad, my ex-best friend,

53:15.492 --> 53:16.560
he walked in first.

53:18.829 --> 53:19.830
And this is how.

53:19.897 --> 53:22.599
He walked into my property
and he's walking in like thi...

53:22.666 --> 53:25.803
This is just how he walks in.
He goes like this: "Hey, man."

53:30.507 --> 53:33.243
I'm like, "What the fuck?
Is a magic show about to start?"

53:33.310 --> 53:34.945
I have no idea what's going on, right?

53:35.212 --> 53:37.915
But then I realize very quickly
that he's doing it like that

53:37.981 --> 53:40.517
'cause little Anika
is hiding behind his leg

53:40.584 --> 53:44.321
and he's playing the dad part
and he asks... He's asking me...

53:44.388 --> 53:48.992
He asks me, he says, "Hey, man.
By the way, have you seen Anika?"

53:55.699 --> 53:58.635
And I'm like, "This motherfucker.
Are you serious right now?"

53:59.570 --> 54:02.439
You and I both know where that bitch is.
Come on, dawg.

54:02.906 --> 54:06.944
I'm trying to keep this shit real, man.
Don't make me eat your bullshit dad life.

54:07.010 --> 54:08.278
"Fuck y'all, man."

54:11.615 --> 54:13.650
Didn't give a shit how real
I tried to keep it.

54:13.717 --> 54:15.886
He just tried to out-dad my realness.

54:16.019 --> 54:18.622
He just did it harder.
He was like, "Fucking, come on."

54:25.929 --> 54:28.832
And I'm stuck.
I'm like, "Fuck, man. Come on, dawg."

54:29.967 --> 54:31.502
This your life, motherfucker.

54:42.446 --> 54:44.481
"I've been looking around for her all day,
dawg."

54:47.518 --> 54:49.820
That's when she goes like this:
"Here I am."

54:50.921 --> 54:52.789
I'm like, "I knew where you were, bitch!"

54:53.590 --> 54:57.494
You're not... You're holding on to his leg.
I can see your little fucking baby hands.

54:57.561 --> 54:59.863
"Disrespecting the hiding game
on my property."

55:03.500 --> 55:05.636
I'm back to pretending.
I'm pretending again.

55:05.702 --> 55:08.672
Thirty-six, pretending I don't know
where this little girl is.

55:08.739 --> 55:11.074
I'm okay with calling her Anika, right?

55:11.441 --> 55:13.010
They stay with me for a week.

55:13.610 --> 55:16.313
You know how shit in life shapes you
and it changes you

55:16.380 --> 55:19.683
and makes you who you are, right?
When you're a kid, you get a bunch of...

55:19.750 --> 55:22.319
When you're Anika's age,
you got a bunch of moments

55:22.386 --> 55:24.321
that shape you and make you who you are.

55:24.388 --> 55:27.457
When you're an adult, don't happen much
'cause you are who you are.

55:27.524 --> 55:31.695
But they do happen, right? Maybe
I've had four or five in my adult life.

55:31.929 --> 55:36.567
I had one while they were staying with me
at the end that fucked me up, all right?

55:36.967 --> 55:41.371
It was where... It made me realize
that, you know, I'm not Denzel

55:41.572 --> 55:42.906
and I'm not the man on fire.

55:43.040 --> 55:47.945
Life isn't my movie and maybe that's okay,
all right? So, here's what happened.

55:48.579 --> 55:55.118
I was, uh... I was on my couch watching
my TV in my TV room in my house.

55:55.385 --> 55:58.555
I was watching this show I like to watch,
which is <i>The First 48</i>, okay?

55:58.622 --> 56:00.490
If you haven't seen the show,
it's graphic.

56:00.557 --> 56:04.461
It, like, shows dead bodies and families
crying over loss of loved ones.

56:04.528 --> 56:06.897
And it's confirming in my heart,
you know what?

56:06.964 --> 56:09.032
The streets must be real out there.

56:10.067 --> 56:11.935
I knew that shit all along, player.

56:13.470 --> 56:16.840
So, I'm watching the show
and I'm watching the show

56:16.907 --> 56:18.875
'cause it's what the fuck I wanna do,
okay?

56:18.942 --> 56:22.379
Now, as I'm watching it, little Anika
walks down the stairs, all right?

56:22.446 --> 56:24.948
Now, as I see her,
my adult brain kicks in.

56:25.015 --> 56:27.451
The same brain that invited them over,
all right?

56:27.517 --> 56:31.488
I was like, "You gotta change the channel.
You can't let her eyes see this"

56:31.555 --> 56:33.690
because she'll grow up
and kill bunnies, right?"

56:33.757 --> 56:36.893
So... I was like, "Good idea.
You gotta change the channel."

56:36.960 --> 56:39.863
So, I went to grab the remote.
As soon as I grabbed the remote,

56:39.930 --> 56:43.667
my gangster side kicked in and I thought,
"You fucking mark-ass bitch."

56:44.001 --> 56:46.136
You going to let this ho run your life?

56:46.803 --> 56:48.872
Fuck that, man.
You're too real for this shit.

56:48.939 --> 56:52.175
"She's gonna change you
just like she did her father before you."

56:52.442 --> 56:55.879
So, then I was like, "All right, I guess
she gonna learn about life tonight."

56:57.781 --> 57:00.517
So, I'm watching this show,
doing what the fuck I wanna do

57:00.584 --> 57:03.987
and little Anika's gotta do it, too,
'cause it's what I wanna do, all right?

57:04.488 --> 57:05.989
Now, about 20 seconds goes by

57:06.056 --> 57:09.526
and I realize that, you know,
she doesn't really care what's going on

57:09.593 --> 57:12.629
'cause there's no cartoons, right?
So, I feel her kind of give up.

57:12.696 --> 57:14.965
And she looks over at me
and she goes like this:

57:15.599 --> 57:16.599
"Hey, Chris."

57:19.903 --> 57:23.140
I'm like, "Fuck, I didn't know
there was gonna be dialogue in this shit."

57:24.541 --> 57:27.110
So, I turned over, I said,
"Yeah, what the fuck you want?"

57:28.745 --> 57:29.980
That's how I sound in my head.

57:30.046 --> 57:32.883
I probably said something like,
"Yes, sweetheart, how can I help you?"

57:36.820 --> 57:40.724
So, she looks at me and goes like this,
"Well, um, I was wondering something."

57:42.159 --> 57:43.894
Like, "Yeah, get on with that shit."

57:44.661 --> 57:46.563
She goes like this, "Well."

57:46.630 --> 57:48.699
She did that quick breath thing
that kids do.

57:48.765 --> 57:51.605
I don't know why they do that,
but like, "Hey. Sorry."

57:51.668 --> 57:53.603
I don't know
how to do all of the stuffs yet.

57:54.771 --> 57:58.208
"I'm not in control of my faculties total
at this point."

58:02.913 --> 58:04.982
So, she looks at me
and this is what she says.

58:05.048 --> 58:10.253
She says, "Well, I was wondering, um...
do you want to see a secret garden?"

58:16.860 --> 58:20.530
At this point, my adult brain and my
gangster are confused as shit, okay?

58:20.864 --> 58:22.866
I looked at her, I said, "Yo, what?"

58:23.133 --> 58:25.802
She repeated herself
like I was the fucking asshole

58:25.869 --> 58:27.004
in this conversation.

58:27.070 --> 58:32.976
She said, "I said...
do you want to see a secret garden?"

58:33.543 --> 58:36.113
And, you know, I mean, like,
yeah, kind of, you know?

58:36.613 --> 58:38.682
Probably not a secret garden
she's gonna show,

58:38.749 --> 58:41.284
but on the off chance she's right,
what is it like, right?

58:41.618 --> 58:43.954
Are there dragons there,
flowers with dicks on them?

58:44.021 --> 58:46.857
Whatever there are,
I wanna Facebook about it, okay?

58:47.624 --> 58:48.725
So, I'm curious now.

58:48.792 --> 58:50.961
So, I grab the remote and I pause my show.

58:51.028 --> 58:53.964
And I look at her and I say,
"Okay, show me the secret garden."

58:54.031 --> 58:55.766
And she got so fucking excited.

58:55.832 --> 58:58.635
She goes like this,
"Okay. Come on, follow me."

58:58.702 --> 59:00.604
And she starts walking around like this,

59:00.670 --> 59:03.673
like some shitty
underwater explorer, okay?

59:03.740 --> 59:06.676
And I follow her. I catch myself
doing the same fucking thing.

59:07.177 --> 59:10.147
I'm walking around my own house
like, hey, anything could pop up

59:10.213 --> 59:11.882
around any one of these corners.

59:11.948 --> 59:14.684
No, it can't. It's my house.
I put everything in it, okay?

59:18.121 --> 59:21.191
So, now, she leads me
through the kitchen twice. Okay?

59:21.858 --> 59:25.228
Yeah, and I'm like, "Yo, does she know
where the secret garden is or what?"

59:26.797 --> 59:29.866
So, I casually mention to her, I was like,
"You know, uh..."

59:31.568 --> 59:35.005
We went through the kitchen two times.
So, like, what's the deal with that?

59:35.806 --> 59:37.574
"You know where this shit is or what?"

59:37.908 --> 59:41.912
Again, like I'm the asshole she responded.
She says, "I know that, okay?"

59:43.113 --> 59:47.017
We had to do that 'cause that's how
you open up the portal to get there."

59:48.118 --> 59:50.620
I have no idea.
I'm like, "You just take the wheel."

59:50.687 --> 59:52.622
No idea what's going on. I mentioned...

59:52.689 --> 59:55.025
I was like,
"Is there maybe a quicker way to go

59:55.092 --> 59:56.359
because my show's still on."

59:56.626 --> 59:59.629
And she goes like this,
"Okay, come on, let's take the shortcut."

01:00:02.132 --> 01:00:06.369
I didn't say it, but I definitely thought,
next time start with the fucking shortcut.

01:00:07.237 --> 01:00:12.209
So, she leads me outside to my backyard
and she goes like this, "Here it is."

01:00:12.275 --> 01:00:15.612
"No, no. This isn't a secret at all."

01:00:15.679 --> 01:00:18.782
I've known about this place
since I bought it. It's my own backyard.

01:00:18.949 --> 01:00:20.183
I've had it for three years.

01:00:20.250 --> 01:00:22.319
"My dogs shit here.
They know about it, too."

01:00:22.385 --> 01:00:24.287
I thought she was gonna change
who I was.

01:00:24.354 --> 01:00:26.323
Instead, I checked into my gangster heart.

01:00:26.389 --> 01:00:30.026
I looked in her eyes and I thought,
"Just another lying-ass bitch."

01:00:33.897 --> 01:00:35.765
I've been down this road before.

01:00:36.666 --> 01:00:38.268
Betrayal is a motherfucker.

01:00:39.369 --> 01:00:42.739
"That's how you got so real
in the first place, dawg."

01:00:43.840 --> 01:00:46.009
So, I looked at her and I went,
"Fucking peace."

01:00:46.743 --> 01:00:49.246
And I pivoted
and I walked back to my house.

01:00:49.312 --> 01:00:53.049
I took about three or four steps
and that's when I heard, "Hey, Chris."

01:00:54.251 --> 01:00:56.953
I'm like, "Oh, shit.
She got more heat for that ass, huh?"

01:00:57.020 --> 01:01:00.157
Fuck that. She ain't changing nothing.
You're still real as fuck.

01:01:00.223 --> 01:01:01.658
"See what the hell she want."

01:01:01.725 --> 01:01:04.394
So, I turn around and say,
"Yeah? What the fuck you want now?"

01:01:04.861 --> 01:01:09.099
And this time she's pointing and she says,
"Hey, look, there's an orange tree."

01:01:09.232 --> 01:01:11.935
And I looked and there was an orange tree.

01:01:12.002 --> 01:01:14.371
I have an orange tree.
I didn't know that, okay?

01:01:16.106 --> 01:01:18.975
That's a secret, but still, fuck her.
She didn't know, right?

01:01:21.077 --> 01:01:23.213
I was surprised. I was like,
"Shit. How you...?

01:01:23.280 --> 01:01:26.316
Oh, my God, you brought this
like you brought this shit with you."

01:01:26.850 --> 01:01:29.119
But I played it cool.
I was like, "All right, yeah."

01:01:29.186 --> 01:01:32.155
Thanks for showing me that shit
that I 100 percent already knew

01:01:32.222 --> 01:01:35.192
that I definitely without a doubt
already had.

01:01:36.927 --> 01:01:37.927
"Peace."

01:01:37.994 --> 01:01:40.063
So, I took a few steps back to my house.

01:01:40.130 --> 01:01:42.799
And that's when I heard in the background,
"Hey, Chris."

01:01:43.700 --> 01:01:46.369
"Like, she really trying
to change a motherfucker. Fuck that."

01:01:46.436 --> 01:01:48.071
She ain't changing nothing. You...

01:01:48.138 --> 01:01:51.107
Well, you do now have an orange tree
that you didn't know about.

01:01:51.374 --> 01:01:53.710
But that don't change
who you are on the inside.

01:01:53.777 --> 01:01:55.745
Now, basically, you're still the same you.

01:01:55.812 --> 01:01:58.915
Only you can enjoy a delicious orange
whenever you so choose.

01:01:59.816 --> 01:02:00.850
Yeah, player.

01:02:00.917 --> 01:02:02.152
Good logic.

01:02:02.419 --> 01:02:04.054
"See what the fuck she want now."

01:02:04.120 --> 01:02:07.924
So, I turn around real as fuck and I say,
"Yeah? What the fuck you want now?"

01:02:08.325 --> 01:02:10.961
She's still pointing, not wavering at all,
being a kid,

01:02:11.027 --> 01:02:14.130
and she says,
"Well, um, do you want to pick one?"

01:02:15.131 --> 01:02:18.301
And I'm like, "Man, I don't give a fuck
about this whole situation",

01:02:18.368 --> 01:02:24.908
but... I am taller than you
and... logistically, it does make sense."

01:02:26.176 --> 01:02:29.879
So, I grabbed the orange like a boss
and I handed it to her.

01:02:29.946 --> 01:02:33.116
And in my head I thought, "Don't ever say
I never did nothing for you."

01:02:33.917 --> 01:02:36.219
A favor for a favor.
That's the code of the streets.

01:02:36.286 --> 01:02:37.286
You hear me?

01:02:37.787 --> 01:02:41.291
One day, and it may not be tomorrow,
I may come knocking on your door

01:02:41.358 --> 01:02:46.062
"and ask you for, like, a banana
or some shit. Anyway... bye."

01:02:46.896 --> 01:02:48.965
I pivot.
I take a few steps back to my house.

01:02:49.032 --> 01:02:51.901
And that's when I hear
in the background again, "Hey, Chris."

01:02:52.135 --> 01:02:54.537
Like, "She really sinking her hooks in,
man. Fuck that."

01:02:54.804 --> 01:02:57.307
You're real. Take them hooks out.
Show her what's up."

01:02:57.374 --> 01:03:00.477
So, I turned around and said,
"Yeah, what the fuck you want now?"

01:03:00.543 --> 01:03:02.946
She's still standing there,
not wavering at all.

01:03:03.013 --> 01:03:05.815
Not caring how real I'm trying to keep it,
just being a kid.

01:03:05.882 --> 01:03:09.419
And she says, "Well, um, do you
want to pick one for yourself?"

01:03:09.486 --> 01:03:10.487
Aw.

01:03:10.553 --> 01:03:12.589
No, don't go "aw," fuck this bitch.

01:03:13.423 --> 01:03:16.226
She's changing you
and she's not even really here right now.

01:03:16.559 --> 01:03:20.397
Know how hard it was to keep streets real
while looking at her fucking angel eyes?

01:03:23.566 --> 01:03:26.336
But I did want one.
I mean, they looked so fucking good.

01:03:29.272 --> 01:03:32.409
So, I was like, "Man, you know what?
Let's strike a deal, man."

01:03:32.475 --> 01:03:34.844
You could eat that shit
and pick that orange

01:03:34.911 --> 01:03:37.180
as long as you do it
while you're keeping it real

01:03:37.247 --> 01:03:40.050
and you eat it
while you're watching <i>The First 48.</i>

01:03:40.583 --> 01:03:42.552
"Yeah, player. Good logic."

01:03:42.852 --> 01:03:43.853
So, I grabbed it.

01:03:43.920 --> 01:03:45.221
And she was being so cute

01:03:45.288 --> 01:03:48.291
that, like, she was really starting
to make me fucking emotional.

01:03:48.358 --> 01:03:51.594
I went... I went, "Bye." I barely looked
at her. I went, "Okay, bye."

01:03:51.861 --> 01:03:53.897
And I pivoted and I walked back quickly.

01:03:53.963 --> 01:03:57.367
As soon as I touched the doorknob
of my door, I hear in the background:

01:03:57.434 --> 01:03:59.302
"Hey, Chris."

01:03:59.369 --> 01:04:02.138
And I'm running on empty.
I got no gas left in the tank.

01:04:02.205 --> 01:04:04.908
I take my last breath,
I turn around and I say:

01:04:04.974 --> 01:04:06.509
"Yeah, what the fuck you want now?"

01:04:06.576 --> 01:04:09.312
And she knew she had me.
She was even cuter at this point.

01:04:09.379 --> 01:04:11.414
She was smaller, her eyes got bigger.

01:04:11.481 --> 01:04:13.350
Someone did her hair in the meantime.

01:04:14.417 --> 01:04:17.887
And she looks at me, no bullshit,
and she actually says:

01:04:17.954 --> 01:04:22.425
"Well, I was wondering, um,
do you want to come to my birthday party?"

01:04:36.306 --> 01:04:38.375

01:04:52.055 --> 01:04:54.124
Whoa, you've got to fix this shit.

01:04:54.657 --> 01:04:56.359

- Are we good?

What, are you fucking telepathic?

Oh, fuck.

01:05:13.309 --> 01:05:14.309
"I'm sorry."

01:05:14.411 --> 01:05:17.514
It's fucking... You guys fucking apologize
over everything.

01:05:22.519 --> 01:05:25.321

Literally had nothing to do with it.

01:05:25.388 --> 01:05:26.388
"I'm sorry."

01:05:27.390 --> 01:05:30.960
"Was that you?" "No, but, you know,
the universe. I'm in it."
