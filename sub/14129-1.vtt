12:27.613 --> 12:29.445

and freeze the sun?

12:29.515 --> 12:30.676
Other than that, nothing.

12:30.750 --> 12:33.720
All I wanted was to get
my paws on some candy.

12:33.786 --> 12:35.845
Yeah. It starts with candy bars, man--

12:35.921 --> 12:37.411
maybe a Snickers fun-size--

12:37.490 --> 12:41.154
and before you know it, you've eaten
all the Three Musketeers and their families.

12:41.227 --> 12:43.127
BRIAN: Oh, yeah.

12:43.195 --> 12:45.960
DYLAN: Maybe you've got, like,
a problem, my furry friend.

12:46.031 --> 12:47.021
No, I don't.

12:47.099 --> 12:49.898
And I'm not gonna rest until
I've done everything in my power

ERMINTRUDE: Doogal!
Do you get tired of watching us work?

13:09.088 --> 13:10.556
You gonna help us
put up the tents?

13:10.623 --> 13:11.613
Hmm?

13:11.690 --> 13:14.250
Uh, no. You guys are
doing a wonderful job.

13:14.326 --> 13:16.795
I mean, keep up the good work.
I'd just be in the way.

13:18.531 --> 13:20.795
Oh...and who's making
dinner tonight?

13:20.866 --> 13:22.391
'Cause I'm getting kinda hungry.

13:23.636 --> 13:24.797
Oh, I see.

13:24.870 --> 13:26.861
The silent treatment, huh?
Well, fine!

13:28.474 --> 13:31.102
I got my own camp over here,
and it's awesome.

13:31.177 --> 13:32.838
I don't need you guys.

13:33.846 --> 13:35.678
Ahh. The full moon.

13:36.248 --> 13:37.443
What do you say, Ermintrude?

13:37.516 --> 13:39.644
Feel likejumping over it
with me?

13:40.152 --> 13:41.142

14:03.442 --> 14:06.275
Your singing killed my chocolate.

14:13.352 --> 14:15.013
It's bedtime.

14:16.088 --> 14:17.988
Thank you.
I might've slept right through it.

14:18.057 --> 14:20.355
Someone should guard the camp,
and I was thinking--

14:20.426 --> 14:21.450
Good. You're on.

14:21.527 --> 14:22.892

Look at me. I'm all alone,
guarding against the cold.

14:56.395 --> 14:58.864
Watchdog! What's wrong

Whoa!

15:35.000 --> 15:36.195
Hey, look! Tracks!

15:36.268 --> 15:37.736
I think they were left by feet.

15:37.803 --> 15:39.293
Wait. I've seen these before.

15:39.371 --> 15:41.499
They can only be made
by the abominable...

Don't worry.
I speak Moose, everyone.

no one knows you're here.

16:24.149 --> 16:26.675
Now, dog, tell me everything.

16:26.752 --> 16:29.380
Well...l was a very happy puppy.

16:29.455 --> 16:32.254
My first memories are of
catching tennis balls with Florence.

16:32.324 --> 16:33.450
And then, as I grew up...

16:33.525 --> 16:36.790
Pipe down!
Tell me about the diamonds!

16:36.862 --> 16:38.921

Well, you're wasting your time.
I don't even have the map.

16:45.237 --> 16:47.706
So...there's a map, huh?

16:49.008 --> 16:52.205
Oh! Uh...no, no, no, no, no!
No map.

16:52.277 --> 16:54.939
You know, lwonder
how long it would take

16:55.014 --> 16:58.348

inside a merry-go-round?

Twenty-seven! Oh, you can't

17:49.401 --> 17:52.098
You've eaten twenty-seven

17:57.009 --> 17:59.171

22:17.102 --> 22:18.331
Aah! Not again!

22:18.403 --> 22:20.098
(cow bell clanging)

22:20.172 --> 22:21.435
SAM: Aah!

22:21.506 --> 22:22.974
(train whistle blows)

22:23.041 --> 22:26.033
ZEEBAD: Just...stand...still!

22:42.594 --> 22:44.790
ZEEBAD: Your days in the sun
are over, Zebedee!

22:44.863 --> 22:47.798
You know, there can only be
one spring to rule them all,

22:47.866 --> 22:51.700
and I am the Lord of the Springs.

22:54.873 --> 22:57.171
Wait! Zebedee's in trouble!

22:57.242 --> 22:59.176
No! Save yourselves!

22:59.244 --> 23:01.178
What'll we do?
What'll we do?

23:01.246 --> 23:02.805
Well, we can't leave him.

23:02.881 --> 23:04.042
To the rescue!

23:06.318 --> 23:09.686
You've got to find the diamonds!

23:14.559 --> 23:15.549
Aah!

23:22.467 --> 23:24.196
You know, Zebedee,
I've been thinking.

23:24.269 --> 23:26.328
You been working so hard,
puttin' in the hours,

23:26.405 --> 23:27.770
it's time to take a break.

23:29.608 --> 23:33.169
Get the diamonds!

23:33.245 --> 23:35.339
DOOGAL: No!

23:36.915 --> 23:39.475
ERMINTRUDE: We don't have a choice.
We have to go now.

23:39.551 --> 23:41.576
There's nothing more
we can do here.

23:41.653 --> 23:42.916
( Doogal cries)

23:45.924 --> 23:47.949
<i>- DYLAN: Come on, Doug.
- ERMMTRUDE". Hum].</i>

23:48.026 --> 23:50.518
(evil laughter)

23:53.098 --> 23:54.532
(Sam clears throat)

23:54.599 --> 23:56.567
( Sam laughs )

23:56.635 --> 24:00.401
No, Sam, the evil laugh really comes
from the back of the throat.

24:04.443 --> 24:06.343
<i>NARRATOR: None of them
wanted to believe it,</i>

24:06.411 --> 24:09.472
<i>but in his heart,
Doogal knew it was true.</i>

24:09.548 --> 24:12.108
<i>Zebedee had gone forever.</i>

24:18.457 --> 24:20.323
I can't believe he's really gone.

24:21.460 --> 24:24.589
DYLAN: Zeb's dead, baby.
Zeb's dead.

24:24.663 --> 24:28.224
But Zebedee's magic is the only thing
that can stop Zeebad.

24:28.300 --> 24:29.927
What are we gonna do?

24:30.001 --> 24:31.901
Be strong, Ermintrude.

24:31.970 --> 24:35.406
We have to be brave.
The world is counting on us.

24:35.474 --> 24:39.502
After all, that was
Zebedee's dying wish.

24:49.421 --> 24:51.048
DYLAN: What are we gonna do?

24:51.122 --> 24:53.921
Without Zebedee,
we're nothing.

24:54.493 --> 24:55.654
Yeah.

24:55.727 --> 24:57.957
ERMINTRUDE: Then we
should just give up.

24:58.530 --> 25:00.464
No! Brian's right!

25:00.532 --> 25:02.660
We're gonna save our world!

25:02.734 --> 25:04.429
Dylan, where's the map?

25:04.503 --> 25:06.437
It's right here.

25:06.505 --> 25:10.464
BRIAN: There--head for
the tallest mountain, straight ahead!

25:10.542 --> 25:11.941
DOOGAL: That's the spirit, everyone!

25:12.010 --> 25:16.140
It would take a sea of boiling lava
to keep us from those diamonds now!

25:17.215 --> 25:19.206
DOOGAL: No way.

25:19.284 --> 25:21.116
ERMINTRUDE: Hey,
look on the bright side--

25:21.186 --> 25:23.621
when the rest of the world
freezes over, we could all live here.

25:24.689 --> 25:27.624
DOOGAL: This can't be the end.
I've got to save Florence!

25:27.692 --> 25:29.285
Well, then, we can't leave
without the diamond,

25:29.361 --> 25:30.692
and it's somewhere over there.

25:30.762 --> 25:33.060
Hey, Doogal, aren't dogs
supposed to, like, fetch?

25:33.131 --> 25:35.600
Not me. The only tricks
I know are, "Sit, Doogal,"

25:35.667 --> 25:37.692
and chasing my tail
till I pass out.

25:37.769 --> 25:40.136
And I'm allergic
to being burnt up.

25:40.205 --> 25:42.401
What about Dylan?
He's got nine lives.

25:42.474 --> 25:43.999
Yeah. That's a cat, genius.

25:44.075 --> 25:46.169
. Enough!
_ Huh?

25:46.244 --> 25:48.235
Ahem. We should all go together.

25:48.813 --> 25:50.247
DOOGAL: Or...

25:50.315 --> 25:52.511
...one of us stays here,
in case something happens.

25:52.584 --> 25:54.245
TRAIN: He's not a dog,
he's a chicken.

25:54.319 --> 25:55.650
Hmm?

25:55.720 --> 25:57.984
All right, all right.
I understand.

25:58.056 --> 25:59.990
You don't want to go
without your leader.

26:01.660 --> 26:04.823
Ooh! ls anybody else hot?

26:04.896 --> 26:08.161
<i>NARRATOR: The bridge
was very, very high.</i>

26:08.233 --> 26:11.897
<i>The path was very, very narrow.</i>

26:12.737 --> 26:15.570
<i>The lava was very, very hot.</i>

26:16.575 --> 26:18.065
<i>Do you think they were scared?</i>

26:18.143 --> 26:19.542
<i>Wouldn't you be?</i>

26:19.611 --> 26:20.601
Ohh!

26:29.754 --> 26:30.744
DOOGAL: Careful!

26:39.097 --> 26:41.156
TRAIN: It's okay.
This is gonna be a snap.

26:42.934 --> 26:44.026
Aah!

26:44.102 --> 26:45.092
Aah! Aah!

26:45.170 --> 26:47.298
No!

26:48.206 --> 26:49.196
Hang on! Hang on!

26:50.342 --> 26:51.901
Up! Pull us up!

26:51.977 --> 26:54.378
Dylan, do something!

26:54.446 --> 26:56.073
DOOGAL: Give it some gas!

26:56.147 --> 26:58.616
I don't know what to do!
Watch out! What does this one do?

26:58.683 --> 26:59.980
UP, down, up, down...?!

27:00.051 --> 27:01.917
I think I can, I think I can,
I think I can,

27:02.053 --> 27:03.418
I think I can...!

27:05.290 --> 27:06.815
TRAIN: Hey! I can!

27:06.891 --> 27:07.983
(sighs of relief)

27:08.059 --> 27:09.288
ERMINTRUDE:
That wasn't even funny!

27:11.129 --> 27:12.893
TRAIN: Excuse me.
Pardon me.

27:13.965 --> 27:16.229
DYLAN: Okay, no need to panic.

27:16.301 --> 27:18.770
Now! Now panic, everybody!

27:18.837 --> 27:20.396
(animals yelling)

27:20.472 --> 27:21.803
- (tires screech )
- TRAIN: Whoa!

27:21.873 --> 27:24.467
(steam whistles)

27:25.644 --> 27:26.839
DYLAN: That was awesome!

27:27.912 --> 27:30.313
Could we go again?
Can we? Can we go again?

27:30.382 --> 27:32.874
(lava bubbles)

27:32.951 --> 27:36.012
DOOGAL: Guys!
Hey, guys, over here!

27:36.087 --> 27:38.317
Hurry up!
I think I see it!

27:38.390 --> 27:40.154
ERMINTRUDE: Look at it!

27:40.225 --> 27:42.023
It's beautiful!

27:42.093 --> 27:44.858
DOOGAL: Ladies and gentlemen,

27:44.929 --> 27:46.761
presenting the first diamond.

27:46.831 --> 27:48.765
And you guys thought
we couldn't do it.

27:49.834 --> 27:51.529
I hope I am pure of heart enough--

27:51.603 --> 27:53.367
Woop! Just kind of
pops right out.

27:53.938 --> 27:55.269
(imitates Gollum)
My precious!

27:55.340 --> 27:56.330
Kidding!

27:57.375 --> 27:58.672
There's a picture inside of it.

28:02.681 --> 28:05.446
<i>- ( Florence shivering )
- What-what if they never come back?</i>

28:05.517 --> 28:07.007
<i>I'm so cold!</i>

28:07.085 --> 28:09.884
<i>Come on, we can't give up hope.</i>

28:10.689 --> 28:12.123
Look! It's Florence!

28:12.190 --> 28:13.715
<i>( Girl' shivering )</i>

28:13.792 --> 28:16.853
<i>Strange. For a second there,
I thought I heard something.</i>

28:18.029 --> 28:20.054
<i>Never mind.
It couldn't have been.</i>

28:20.131 --> 28:21.462
She heard me?

28:21.533 --> 28:24.503
Florence, it's me, Doogal!
You've got to hang on!

28:24.569 --> 28:27.800
<i>Doogal, is that you?
I-l can't hear you!</i>

28:27.872 --> 28:30.136
DOOGAL: No, come back!
Florence!

28:30.208 --> 28:31.300
FLORENCE: Doogal!

28:31.376 --> 28:32.969
She's my best friend.

28:33.044 --> 28:35.706
If Florence doesn't make it,
I don't know how <i>I</i> will.

28:36.715 --> 28:37.705
Ohh.

28:37.782 --> 28:39.716
(evil laughter)

28:39.784 --> 28:41.718
- ( Ermintrude gasps)
- DYLAN: Ohh!

28:42.787 --> 28:44.084
For me?

28:44.155 --> 28:46.146
And I didn't get you anything.

28:46.224 --> 28:47.749
And now, the map.

28:47.826 --> 28:49.817
Who said anything about a map, huh?

28:49.894 --> 28:52.158
(Zeebad laughs)

28:52.230 --> 28:54.255
DYLAN: Oh, Doogal, you didn't.

28:56.401 --> 28:58.165
But they tortured it out of me.

28:58.236 --> 29:00.500
Yes. We're proud of our work.

29:00.572 --> 29:01.664
Let's have it.

29:03.975 --> 29:05.500
ZEEBAD: I'm sorry.
Where's my head?

29:05.577 --> 29:08.342
- Please?
- Over my dead body.

29:08.413 --> 29:11.246
See, Sam? Try to be civil,
use the "P" word--

29:11.316 --> 29:14.013
I guess now I'll have to get
the garlic butter!

29:14.085 --> 29:15.450
You're bluffing.

29:15.520 --> 29:18.751
Look, it's the map,
or you're snail parmesan.

29:18.823 --> 29:21.349
You mess with the snail
and you talkin' to the cow!

29:21.426 --> 29:23.155
Here. Take the stupid map.

29:23.228 --> 29:25.890
DOOGAL: You can't read it.
It's in Pig Latin.

29:25.964 --> 29:28.524
Oh, really?
Ice-nay Y-tray.

29:28.600 --> 29:31.535
I studied Pig Latin
in "Ice School," dog.

29:31.603 --> 29:33.697
Sorry we can't stay,
but you know how it is.

29:33.772 --> 29:35.866
Diamonds to find,
planets to freeze.

29:35.940 --> 29:37.430
Been nice seeing you all again.

29:42.614 --> 29:43.638
ZEEBAD: Come on, Sam.

29:43.715 --> 29:46.275
Gonna play a little game
called Break the Bridge.

29:46.351 --> 29:48.615
SAM: Sounds like fun, sir.
What's the objective?

29:48.686 --> 29:51.383
ZEEBAD: Just...follow...me!

29:51.456 --> 29:52.946
SAM: Like this, sir?

29:53.024 --> 29:55.288
Ten-hut! Yes!

29:55.360 --> 29:56.623
Hello!

29:56.694 --> 29:59.925
(grunts with exertion)
That's good! Yes, sir!

29:59.998 --> 30:01.989
Hi!

30:02.066 --> 30:03.329
Ohh!

30:03.401 --> 30:04.891
This is a bad game!

30:07.305 --> 30:10.002
Ohh!

30:10.074 --> 30:11.303
(Zeebad chuckles)

30:15.180 --> 30:19.083
ZEEBAD: Good work, Sam!
I should give you a raise!

30:19.150 --> 30:20.140
Yes, sir.

30:21.519 --> 30:24.420
DYLAN: Dude, that guy's,
like, totally villainous, man.

30:24.489 --> 30:25.752
What is <i>up</i> with that?

30:25.824 --> 30:28.589
I mean, did he not get
enough structure as a kid,

30:28.660 --> 30:30.094
or, I don't know...?

30:32.597 --> 30:34.759
DOOGAL: How are we ever
gonna get out of here?

30:35.500 --> 30:38.333
That's it! Shaw's over!
We're finished!

30:38.403 --> 30:41.100
Just as I was about to hit it big!

30:41.172 --> 30:42.333
You are big.

30:42.407 --> 30:44.842
Thanks, Doogie, but I want
to go out singing like Aretha,

30:44.909 --> 30:47.537
not grilled up like some
big old sirloin steak.

30:47.612 --> 30:48.943
Hey, now, wait.

30:49.013 --> 30:52.039
Might I remind you that we are
carrying a secret weapon.

30:52.116 --> 30:55.313
You mean our faith in each other
and the power of friendship?

30:55.887 --> 30:59.721
Sure, that, and...
Zebedee's magic box!

30:59.791 --> 31:01.555
( Chuckles )
Cool!

31:01.626 --> 31:05.529
Now, if I could just get my head
around how to work this thing.

31:05.597 --> 31:08.089
Did Zebedee give anyone
the instructions?

31:08.166 --> 31:10.134
Just press the button!

31:10.201 --> 31:12.033
Okay! Chill!

31:13.872 --> 31:15.772
A boat. Great.

31:15.840 --> 31:18.571
And now we'll just sail away
on the boiling lava.

31:18.643 --> 31:19.974
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

31:20.044 --> 31:21.534
I've got a set of tools.

31:21.613 --> 31:23.081
Anyone seen Pimp My Boat?

31:23.648 --> 31:25.673
BRIAN: He's really lost it this time.

31:25.750 --> 31:28.310
ERMINTRUDE: Ooh, this heat
is makin' my skin all leathery!

31:28.386 --> 31:30.650
I must look like a walkin' handbag!

31:30.722 --> 31:32.053
BRIAN: Oh, no, Ermintrude.

31:32.123 --> 31:36.060
I think you look--
that is, I find you--

31:36.127 --> 31:39.620
Look, in case we don't
make it out of here,

31:39.697 --> 31:41.324
I just want you to know that--

31:41.399 --> 31:43.595
DYLAN: Hey, anyone need a lift?

31:43.668 --> 31:44.692
BRIAN: Whoa!

A flying boat? Not bad!
That's some smart thinking.

32:12.297 --> 32:14.959
It's all about altitude
over attitude, Ermin-dude.

32:15.033 --> 32:18.560
Excuse me. We still have
one small problem.

32:18.636 --> 32:21.731
We have no idea where we're going.

32:21.806 --> 32:23.035
Brian's right.

32:23.107 --> 32:24.802
We could drift around here
for years.

ZEEBAD: How about
"The Sound of Silence"?

32:44.696 --> 32:47.131
SAM: Okay. You'll have to harmonize.
I'll take the high notes, and--

32:47.198 --> 32:48.666
No, Sam. Zip it.

32:48.733 --> 32:50.895
I gotta get my head on straight
about these diamonds.

32:50.969 --> 32:52.562
The map only tells us so much.

32:52.637 --> 32:56.767

33:01.245 --> 33:03.475
Just pipe down and row, Garfunkel!

33:03.548 --> 33:04.640
(voice echoes)

33:04.716 --> 33:07.981
Soon, I will have ultimate power.
There'll be no sun!

33:08.052 --> 33:11.545
And I'll get a blue Humvee
that reads "Ice Man" on the side of it.

33:11.622 --> 33:13.147
Booya!

33:13.224 --> 33:15.352
(evil laugh)

33:15.426 --> 33:17.258
( not-so-evil laugh )

33:18.329 --> 33:21.026
Sam...you're ruining the moment.

33:21.099 --> 33:22.362
SAM: Sorry, sir.

33:36.347 --> 33:38.372
Is that a falling star, Trude?

33:38.449 --> 33:39.439
Falling?!

33:39.517 --> 33:40.882
Do not talk about falling when we are

33:40.952 --> 33:43.546
floating perilously above the earth
in a homemade balloon!

33:44.822 --> 33:45.812
Hmm.

33:45.890 --> 33:46.880
Okay.

33:49.060 --> 33:50.619
Aren't the stars beautiful?

33:50.695 --> 33:52.527
Mm-hmm.

33:52.597 --> 33:54.395
So beautiful!

33:54.465 --> 33:56.957
Wouldn't you love to be one of them?

33:57.035 --> 33:59.800
<i>I'd give anything.</i>

33:59.871 --> 34:02.806
You'd make a wonderful star.

34:02.874 --> 34:05.343
Oh, Brian. Now you're just
playing with me.

34:05.410 --> 34:07.845
So serene.

34:08.880 --> 34:10.746
So heavenly.

34:11.315 --> 34:14.444
Traveling everywhere in a limo!

34:15.085 --> 34:17.578
Always looking down on everyone.

34:17.655 --> 34:21.489
Ohhh, yes!

34:21.559 --> 34:23.493
( Yawns )

34:23.561 --> 34:24.891
We should get some sleep, man.

34:24.962 --> 34:27.693
Seriously, is that all you think about?

34:27.764 --> 34:31.030
Well, only when I'm awake.

34:31.101 --> 34:32.661
I can't sleep.

34:32.737 --> 34:35.001
I'm too worried about Florence.

34:35.072 --> 34:37.440
She's so helpless without me.

34:37.507 --> 34:39.203
She must be petrified.

34:39.277 --> 34:41.609
Pet...fried?

34:42.179 --> 34:43.909
Bad karma!

34:43.981 --> 34:46.449
It's just, we're a team.

34:47.452 --> 34:49.420
Whatever we do,
we do it together.

34:50.420 --> 34:52.889
Her life would be quite empty
without me there.

34:53.458 --> 34:56.655
Yeah. Me sleepy now.

34:56.726 --> 34:57.717
( Snoring )

34:57.795 --> 35:02.198
During scary thunderstorms,
she insists I sleep on the bed with her...

35:02.266 --> 35:03.995
for her protection.

35:04.068 --> 35:06.901
She just loves to throw
a tennis ball.

35:06.971 --> 35:08.632
And who's always there
to bring it back,

35:08.706 --> 35:11.266
just so that she can have
the enjoyment of throwing it again?

35:11.342 --> 35:15.711
I'm telling you, Dylan,
I bet she really misses that.

35:15.780 --> 35:16.770
Really.

35:16.948 --> 35:18.541
<i>Really.</i>

35:18.616 --> 35:19.947
I know I do.

35:21.285 --> 35:23.276
(birds squawking and trilling)

35:35.633 --> 35:37.897
Hey, guys, Skull Island.

35:37.969 --> 35:39.960
It looksjust like it does in the movies.

35:40.037 --> 35:42.563
Ice. That means more Zeebad.

35:42.640 --> 35:46.099
Something strange
is definitely afoot.

35:46.177 --> 35:49.078
DYLAN: Oh, it's definitely afoot.
Hope Kong's not awake.

35:49.147 --> 35:51.582
DOOGAL: Guys, this place
looks kind of creepy.

35:51.649 --> 35:53.583
Maybe we should circle
the island again.

35:57.155 --> 36:00.420
Ah! We're a couple of real
Tomb Raiders, aren't we, sir?

36:02.059 --> 36:03.527
ZEEBAD: There we go.

36:03.594 --> 36:06.586
Welcome to the Aztec Galleria Mall.

36:06.664 --> 36:08.063
Let's bounce.

36:11.169 --> 36:12.659
Hold up, sir, hold up.

36:12.737 --> 36:14.205
After me, sir.

36:14.272 --> 36:17.833
It could be dangerous,
and I've got a sixth sense.

36:17.909 --> 36:19.240
(twang )

36:19.310 --> 36:21.642
Yes, and you almost lost
three through five.

36:21.712 --> 36:23.578
Why don't you use
some common sense?

36:23.648 --> 36:25.776
I'm gonna go check
for hieroglyphics.

36:25.850 --> 36:27.181
Ah, here we go.

36:27.251 --> 36:29.151
Men's room, food court...

36:29.220 --> 36:31.018
Ha! Booby-trapped lobby.

36:31.088 --> 36:33.785
SAM: Well, that was a bad idea.

36:33.858 --> 36:35.826
Someone could get hurt
walking through here.

36:35.893 --> 36:38.191
DYLAN: Land, ho!

36:38.262 --> 36:39.423
What was that?

36:46.737 --> 36:48.466
ZEEBAD: They're still alive?!

36:48.539 --> 36:49.802
SAM: Well, wax my mustache!

36:49.874 --> 36:52.468
ZEEBAD: It's perfect!
It'll be like mice in a mousetrap.

36:52.543 --> 36:54.136
They'll clear the way,

36:54.212 --> 36:57.409
and then we just stroll in
and get the cheese.

36:58.115 --> 36:59.810
SAM: Quite evil of you, sir!

37:01.319 --> 37:03.845
DOOGAL: Are you sure
we're sure about this?

37:03.921 --> 37:06.083
It's not too late to turn around.

37:06.157 --> 37:07.147
Or...

37:07.225 --> 37:09.250
Whoa! Aah!

37:09.327 --> 37:10.317
OW!

37:10.394 --> 37:11.657
(train whistle blows)

37:13.397 --> 37:14.387
Sorry.

37:14.966 --> 37:17.901
Hey! Look at all these cool plants!

37:18.469 --> 37:19.527
(rattling sound)

37:19.604 --> 37:20.901
Ohh!

37:20.972 --> 37:23.031
We should, like,
send Zeebad a bouquet.

37:23.107 --> 37:25.201
I wonder where Zeebad is.

37:25.276 --> 37:27.301
I think we must have passed him.

37:27.378 --> 37:28.368
Nice one, Train.

37:28.446 --> 37:29.709
- No worries, Rabbit.
- (bell dings)

37:29.780 --> 37:32.215
Wait here,
and keep your pistons pumping.

37:32.283 --> 37:33.876
We're gonna need 'em
for a quick getaway.

37:33.951 --> 37:34.383
(train whistle blows)

37:45.863 --> 37:48.457
(evil laughter)

37:50.034 --> 37:51.524
Oh, look!
Full of caveman pictures!

37:51.602 --> 37:53.434
It mightjust mean "Welcome,"

37:53.504 --> 37:55.529
or "Aloha," or, uh...

37:56.140 --> 37:58.541
"Death to All Who Come Here."

37:58.609 --> 38:01.203
I know. Why don't you
go on up ahead.

38:01.279 --> 38:03.407
We'll be right behind you, prayin'.

38:03.481 --> 38:05.950
Oh, for Pete's sake,
<i>I'll</i> go.

38:06.017 --> 38:09.385
It's amazing we've gotten this far
with all this whining and sarcasm.

38:09.453 --> 38:13.048
If we put half as much work into
the mission as we put into our bickering...

38:13.124 --> 38:15.286
I guess Brian really does
have a backbone.

38:15.359 --> 38:16.690
And here's an idea.

38:16.761 --> 38:18.422
Why don't we stop thinking
just about ourselves

38:18.496 --> 38:20.658
and start paying attention
to what's going on around us

38:20.731 --> 38:22.563
instead of living
in our own little bubble.

38:22.633 --> 38:25.159
Nobody ever asks,
"Brian, what do you think about politics?

38:25.236 --> 38:26.260
"Brian, seen any good movies lately?

38:26.337 --> 38:27.827
Brian, are you any good
at video games?"

38:27.905 --> 38:30.738
Because, yes, I am.
I have excellent reflexes.

38:30.808 --> 38:33.903
But if I gotta hear one more joke
about snail-mail or being shell-shocked,

38:33.978 --> 38:35.946
I think I'm gonna lose my cool!

38:36.013 --> 38:38.914
Because, honestly,
the wrong words can be crushing.

38:38.983 --> 38:40.348
(all gasp)

38:41.986 --> 38:42.976
Hmm.

38:43.054 --> 38:44.215
Let's go!

38:45.423 --> 38:46.754
( Metal clatters)

38:50.661 --> 38:52.652
I never thought I'd say this,

38:52.730 --> 38:55.199
but what a snail!

38:55.266 --> 38:58.634
(jungle birds cawing
and trilling)

38:58.703 --> 39:00.694
(frightful squawk)

39:02.940 --> 39:04.999
<i>NARRATOR: You know when you
have butterflies in your tummy?</i>

39:05.076 --> 39:08.774
<i>Well, the poor little train
had butterflies in his boiler.</i>

39:11.349 --> 39:13.977
(steam whistles)

39:24.362 --> 39:25.796
BRIAN: Hmm!

39:27.298 --> 39:28.493
- Hey!
- Whoa!

39:28.566 --> 39:30.534
Anybody find the diamonds?

39:30.601 --> 39:33.798
Whoa, whoa! Let's use
our inside voices, Doogal.

39:33.871 --> 39:35.635
Start looking for clues.

39:35.706 --> 39:39.700
(sniffing) Hmm. This must be
where they had all the luaus.

39:41.879 --> 39:45.679
Oh, a throne! The perfect place
to enjoy my last piece of bubble gum.

39:45.750 --> 39:46.842
(chews noisily)

39:46.917 --> 39:49.147
Oh, look. A recline button.

39:50.755 --> 39:52.416
Ohh! Ohh!

39:52.490 --> 39:53.480
Oh, no!

39:53.557 --> 39:54.991
Dudes, what...?

39:57.261 --> 39:58.626
Whoa! What...?

39:58.696 --> 40:00.255
Oh, look!

40:11.575 --> 40:12.940
(chewing bubble gum)

40:13.010 --> 40:14.375
Cool light show!

40:15.746 --> 40:17.180
Very Pink Floyd.

40:17.248 --> 40:18.272
No!

40:18.349 --> 40:20.340
They're alarm beams.

40:20.418 --> 40:22.284
Someone has to get through
to the diamond.

40:22.853 --> 40:24.287
But I'm chewing my gum.

40:24.355 --> 40:25.845
I'm a little jumpy.

40:25.923 --> 40:28.722
Didn't y'all hear Brian before?
I'll do it!

40:28.793 --> 40:30.056
I used to be a dancer, you know.

40:30.127 --> 40:33.290
Back when I was on Soul Train,
I had all the moves.

40:33.364 --> 40:36.527
Stop talking, Ermintrude,
and please get me out of here!

40:36.600 --> 40:38.625

40:52.950 --> 40:54.111
Ohh!

Yeah, yeah, yeah...yow!

Hey, thought we said
no Disney jokes.

Anybody know karate?

DYLAN: I trained with Morpheus.

I know kung-fu, John Woo,

41:54.078 --> 41:56.445
judo, kendo, tae kwon do,

41:56.514 --> 41:59.176
Wu-Tang Clan, and chai tea.

Ha! Can you teach me
some of that?

42:01.719 --> 42:04.689
Dylan, can you beat them up?

My name is Neo.

Hey, I'm Steve.

There is no spoon.

Aw, man! Steve's down!

42:16.534 --> 42:17.524
SKELETON: Moo!

42:17.601 --> 42:18.727
Uh...

42:23.707 --> 42:26.836
That's what I call
pulling yourself together.

42:26.911 --> 42:28.470
Okay, ready guys?

42:28.546 --> 42:30.207
On three. One...two...

42:33.484 --> 42:35.680
Maybe we shoulda
done that on two.

42:35.753 --> 42:37.721
I have a bone to pick with you.

42:37.788 --> 42:38.914
Behind you!

42:39.990 --> 42:41.890
- What?

42:41.959 --> 42:43.051
It's hammer time.

Ha ha! You know
you can't touch this.

42:52.069 --> 42:53.901
<i>Wax on...wax off!</i>

42:57.174 --> 42:59.199
Hmm. A good group effort.

42:59.276 --> 43:01.370
Now let's grab the diamond
and head out.

43:05.749 --> 43:07.581
Why do I always get the shaft?

43:08.919 --> 43:10.444
Lucky I have tunnel vision.

43:22.600 --> 43:23.590
Ouch.

43:26.904 --> 43:27.894
Whoa!

43:31.175 --> 43:33.803
Ohh!

43:38.115 --> 43:42.211
So...the fearless warrior of legend

43:42.286 --> 43:46.052
has come to claim the diamond.

43:46.123 --> 43:48.251

Just a couple of Muggles

here for a pickup from
He Who Must Not Be Named.

43:52.563 --> 43:54.395
Is that you, governor?

43:54.465 --> 43:59.062
What? Look, do you want
the diamond or don't you?

43:59.136 --> 44:02.106
Oh. Well, if you're offering.
Yes, please.

44:02.172 --> 44:03.867
I've got a better idea.

44:03.941 --> 44:05.966
Let'sjump him.

marge!

44:20.991 --> 44:22.459
It was just a thought.

44:22.526 --> 44:24.119
How about...

44:24.194 --> 44:27.323
run away!

44:27.398 --> 44:30.163
(animals scream)

Aah!

44:36.407 --> 44:37.636
Aah! Hey! Hey!

I promise, I won't ever
bury another bone ever again!

Aah! Aah! Aah!

44:55.793 --> 44:57.989
Fiddlesticks!

Way to finally step up, Doogal.

45:02.966 --> 45:04.024
DYLAN: Well done.

45:04.101 --> 45:06.798
Well, if you keep your cool
and try not to freak out,

45:06.870 --> 45:08.235
it's amazing what you can do.

45:08.305 --> 45:10.171
Now let's grab the diamond
and get out of here.

45:10.240 --> 45:11.230

45:11.308 --> 45:12.537
DYLAN: Whoa!

45:12.609 --> 45:13.872
H's gone!

45:14.445 --> 45:17.107
Oh, someone's been watching CSI.

45:17.181 --> 45:19.548
- Now, I'd like to thank the Academy--
- Coming, sir!

45:20.217 --> 45:23.482
Ohh, you just can't get
good help these days.

45:23.554 --> 45:26.319
So, which one of you knuckleheads

45:26.390 --> 45:28.688
wants to tell me where
the third diamond is?

45:28.759 --> 45:30.249
NOpe!

45:30.327 --> 45:32.728
Resistance is futile!

45:33.297 --> 45:35.527
It's about to get chilly in here!

45:35.599 --> 45:38.034
You don't want to press our buttons,

45:38.102 --> 45:39.365
right, Doogal?

45:39.436 --> 45:40.494
_ ( be" dings)
- Aah!

45:40.571 --> 45:43.563
Yeah! That's the last
we'll see of them. Huh?

45:44.475 --> 45:45.704
SAM: Hello, sir!

45:45.776 --> 45:48.074
- Aah!
<i>'</i> No!

45:50.147 --> 45:51.376
- (loud clank)
- SAM: My fault, sir!

45:51.448 --> 45:53.280
Good thinking, Ermintrude.

45:53.350 --> 45:57.082
Yeah, dude, but we just
flushed away diamonds one and two.

45:57.154 --> 45:59.521
So...what do we do now?

45:59.590 --> 46:01.024
Look at the picture on the wall.

46:01.091 --> 46:04.026
That looksjust like
our little carousel back home.

46:04.094 --> 46:05.584
BRIAN: And that looks like a diamond.

46:05.662 --> 46:06.993
DOOGAL: That's it!

46:07.064 --> 46:09.260
The third diamond is inside the carousel.

46:09.333 --> 46:11.529
It's been right in our
own backyard this whole time!

46:11.602 --> 46:13.297
And Zeebad has no idea.

46:14.304 --> 46:17.365
That's it. We've got to get
back to the carousel right away.

46:17.441 --> 46:19.705
Since Zeebad's out of commission,

46:19.777 --> 46:21.871
with no hieroglyphic info...
(yawns )

46:21.945 --> 46:23.640
I think it's time for a little siesta.

46:26.316 --> 46:27.784
DOOGAL: Guys, look!

46:29.486 --> 46:31.113
- (metal clanks)
- What's that?

46:31.622 --> 46:32.612
Voices?

46:34.725 --> 46:36.090
DOOGAL: Whoa!

46:36.660 --> 46:37.718
TRAIN: Who's there?

46:37.795 --> 46:40.560
Hey, that sounds familiar!

46:40.631 --> 46:43.623
I'll take familiar
over the Temple of Doom any day.

46:43.700 --> 46:44.826
Let's get out of here.

46:52.810 --> 46:54.073
ERMINTRUDE: Oh, slow down!

46:54.144 --> 46:55.908
You're making my milk curdle.

46:55.979 --> 46:58.414
Are you kidding?
We're moving at a snail's pace.

46:58.482 --> 47:00.541
A snail's pace is just fine with me.

47:00.617 --> 47:02.745
Oh, Ermintrude!

47:02.820 --> 47:04.686
That's the nicest thing
you've ever said.

47:04.755 --> 47:06.587
Relax, Doogie.

47:06.657 --> 47:09.456
Soon this whole crazy trip
will be behind us.

47:10.260 --> 47:11.318
Behind us!

47:11.395 --> 47:14.421
- That's what I said, man!
- No, look behind us!

47:14.498 --> 47:16.489
You can't leave.

47:16.567 --> 47:19.002
- Faster!
- Choo-choo-chooing!

47:20.003 --> 47:20.993
Head's up!

47:22.840 --> 47:25.309
Whoa!

47:26.844 --> 47:29.006
Whoa!

47:30.214 --> 47:33.878
Whoa, dudes, talk about
a near-death experience!

47:33.951 --> 47:36.010
I thought I saw the light
at the end of the tunnel!

47:36.587 --> 47:38.885
That is the light at the end of the tunnel!

47:38.956 --> 47:40.720
We're gonna be all right!

47:40.791 --> 47:43.453
And Zeebad's still trapped
in the temple!

47:46.630 --> 47:48.860
Then, like, who's that?

47:48.932 --> 47:50.900
His evil clone, Mini-Zee?

47:55.873 --> 47:58.808
Where's my third diamond?

47:58.876 --> 48:00.469
Very assertive, sir!

48:03.013 --> 48:04.071
Oh, no!

48:13.924 --> 48:15.915
<i>Whoa!</i>

48:15.993 --> 48:18.690
(animals shouting)

48:22.432 --> 48:24.730
TRAIN: Hang on!

48:33.911 --> 48:34.901
Aah!

48:41.018 --> 48:44.113
Somebody pull a lever
or press a button or something!

48:44.187 --> 48:47.020
Okay. This one
looks like it's for the radio,

48:47.090 --> 48:48.421
this is for the AC,

48:48.492 --> 48:50.051
and this one looks...green.

48:50.127 --> 48:51.686
Aah!

48:51.762 --> 48:53.753
Or it could be an ejector seat.

48:53.830 --> 48:56.299
Aah!

48:57.200 --> 48:59.635
- (loud clank)
- What was that? I think we've been hit!

48:59.703 --> 49:02.195
Where am I?
I've been blinded!

49:02.272 --> 49:03.865
I'll never make it
to the carousel now!

49:03.941 --> 49:04.931
Huh?

49:05.008 --> 49:07.340
So that's where they're headed.

49:07.844 --> 49:09.141
The carousel!

49:09.212 --> 49:12.307
And that is where I'll find
my third and final diamond.

49:12.382 --> 49:13.543
Ha ha ha!

49:13.617 --> 49:15.244
So long, slime ball!

49:17.487 --> 49:19.421
(train whistle blows)

49:19.489 --> 49:22.891
Sam, we've a prisoner up there
we need to dispose of.

49:22.960 --> 49:24.689
Dispose of the prisoner?

49:24.761 --> 49:26.991
We can't do that, sir.
Geneva Convention, sir!

49:27.064 --> 49:29.761
I don't care if it's a Star Trek convention!

49:29.833 --> 49:32.564
(evil laughter)

49:32.636 --> 49:34.502
Trekkies! Nerd alert!

49:35.605 --> 49:36.595
Beam him out!

49:36.673 --> 49:38.971
Help! Help!

49:39.042 --> 49:40.476
Brian!

49:44.348 --> 49:45.679
Whoa!

49:46.883 --> 49:49.409
- Ow!
- Whoa!

49:49.486 --> 49:50.612
Sorry about that.

49:50.687 --> 49:54.021
Ohh, Ermintrude,
you saved me.

49:59.763 --> 50:02.289
We're gonna lose this race
to Thomas the Tank Engine?

50:02.366 --> 50:03.925
I don't think so!
More coal!

50:04.001 --> 50:05.992
Shoveling as fast as I can, sir!

50:06.503 --> 50:08.301
(high-pitched hiss)

50:10.240 --> 50:12.299
(train horn blares)

50:12.376 --> 50:13.366
Whoa!

50:13.443 --> 50:15.377
Trouble, dead ahead!

50:18.849 --> 50:19.839
Fine.

50:19.916 --> 50:22.613
Now it's time to stick it to the man--

50:22.686 --> 50:24.620
to the dog, snail, cow, etc.

50:24.688 --> 50:26.156
You guys know what I mean.

50:28.291 --> 50:29.281
Aah!

50:29.359 --> 50:30.724
Oh, no!

50:30.794 --> 50:32.228
(high-pitched hissing)

50:32.295 --> 50:34.730
Sir, the pressure!
It's too much!

50:34.798 --> 50:36.391
Sam, I know!

50:36.967 --> 50:39.800
Not to get all Dr. Phil on you,
but you need balance in your life

50:39.870 --> 50:41.133
or you'll just explode!

50:41.204 --> 50:42.968
Funny you should say that, sir.

50:48.211 --> 50:50.680
Ooh! That little blue man
just blew up!

50:50.747 --> 50:53.216
TRAIN: That's the good news.
And the bad news is--

50:53.283 --> 50:54.808
Aah!

50:55.385 --> 50:58.878
DYLAN: I can fly!

50:59.956 --> 51:01.219
No, I can't.

51:01.291 --> 51:02.281
(train whistle shrieks)

51:02.359 --> 51:04.657
Ohh!

51:04.728 --> 51:06.924
DYLAN: I'm fine.
I broke the fall with my face.

51:08.565 --> 51:10.192
Ermintrude, are you all right?

51:10.267 --> 51:13.498
Well, Brian, I'd have been
better with a shell.

51:13.570 --> 51:15.060
Guys, let's get moving.

51:15.138 --> 51:17.869
At least Zeebad doesn't know
where the last diamond is.

51:17.941 --> 51:20.603
Yeah, that's not exactly true.

51:20.677 --> 51:23.669
Back there on the train,
I was dazed and confused,

51:23.747 --> 51:25.681
and it sort of slipped out.

51:25.749 --> 51:27.080
It slipped out?

51:27.150 --> 51:29.414
Oh, like you've never
been confused before?

51:29.486 --> 51:31.545
Yeah, but it's just...
um, what?

51:31.621 --> 51:33.749
Blaming each other
won't solve anything.

51:33.824 --> 51:35.087
Now let's get on the train.

51:35.926 --> 51:37.724
I think I just pulled a gasket.

51:38.428 --> 51:41.762
Attention, passengers.
We may experience a delay.

51:41.832 --> 51:43.357
Can you put any weight on it?

51:45.168 --> 51:46.294
Ohh.

51:46.369 --> 51:48.701
Ohh! Yeah, I'm out of service.

51:48.772 --> 51:51.605
Well, you did fall
half a mile out the sky.

51:51.675 --> 51:54.110
The sun is setting!

51:54.177 --> 51:57.078
TRAIN: Then you've got to
keep moving without me.

51:57.147 --> 51:59.138
DYLAN:
Just keep it elevated, man.

52:00.951 --> 52:04.114
BRIAN: You can make it.
Just follow our tracks.

52:05.455 --> 52:06.786
TRAIN: Don't worry about me.

52:08.625 --> 52:11.117
(train whistle blows)

52:17.134 --> 52:19.569
Wow, that was irritating.
Should have got the insurance.

52:19.636 --> 52:22.469
Sam! Quit loafing around
and let's get moving!

52:22.539 --> 52:24.473
( Grunts )
Sorry, sir.

52:24.541 --> 52:25.736
Not doing too well.

52:25.809 --> 52:29.074
Did you, uh, see a bright light?

52:29.146 --> 52:31.137
Yes, Sam, I've seen the light.

52:31.214 --> 52:32.807
It's the light bulb
that went off in my head

52:32.883 --> 52:35.875
that makes me realize I never should have
counted on you in the first place!

52:35.952 --> 52:38.250
As my apprentice, you're fired!

52:38.321 --> 52:41.222
Sorry, sir.
ls there any severance package?

52:41.291 --> 52:44.090
Well, the best I can do
is not freeze you.

52:44.161 --> 52:45.560
<i>Hasta Ia vista, wood man.</i>

52:46.997 --> 52:47.987
Peace out.

52:48.064 --> 52:49.225
( Groans )

52:51.668 --> 52:55.571
Villains.
They can be so...cruel.

52:55.639 --> 52:57.539
(wind howling)

52:57.774 --> 52:59.765
<i>NARRATOR:
There was no escaping it.</i>

52:59.843 --> 53:02.869
<i>2eebad's icy grip
was all over the world.</i>

53:11.521 --> 53:13.615
BRIAN: I-| can't feel my limb.

53:14.691 --> 53:16.750
DOOGAL: But Florence and the kids.

53:16.826 --> 53:19.955
If we don't make it there soon,
they'll be frozen solid.

53:20.030 --> 53:23.295
In case you haven't noticed,
we are not doing much better, Doogal.

53:23.366 --> 53:25.130
W-well, you know what they say, man.

53:25.202 --> 53:27.728
W-what doesn't kill you
makes you stronger...

53:27.804 --> 53:29.203
or colder.

53:30.273 --> 53:32.207
Look! Footprints.

53:34.477 --> 53:36.002
They're fresh, too.

53:36.079 --> 53:38.047
Maybe they'll lead us back home.

53:38.114 --> 53:40.481
W-well, like,
what kind of freaky creatures

53:40.550 --> 53:43.315
would leave footprints like these?

53:43.386 --> 53:45.548
They must be exhausted, too.

53:45.622 --> 53:49.081
One of them seems to be
crawling along the ground.

53:50.393 --> 53:52.521
I prefer the term "gliding."

53:52.596 --> 53:55.088
ERMINTRUDE: Oh, man, they're ours!

53:55.165 --> 53:58.567
And I used to think
that chasing my tail was c-cute.

53:58.635 --> 54:00.933
Well, I'm just gonna
lie down here

54:01.004 --> 54:04.531
on this warm beach
and lay in the sand.

54:04.608 --> 54:06.235
I don't know what to say, Doogal,

54:06.309 --> 54:09.335
but I guess our best
wasn't nearly good enough.

54:10.180 --> 54:12.672
I guess this is curtains, y'all.

54:12.749 --> 54:14.114
( Gasps )

54:14.184 --> 54:16.516
DOOGAL: No!
We can't give up now.

54:16.586 --> 54:17.678
We're close!

54:17.754 --> 54:19.347
I can feel it.

54:20.423 --> 54:22.858
I told Florence I'd save her.

54:22.926 --> 54:24.416
I promised!

54:26.496 --> 54:29.932
Florence!

54:31.735 --> 54:32.725
Florence.

54:38.275 --> 54:39.606
( Moose breaks wind )

54:39.676 --> 54:40.871
<i>Uh-oh.</i>

54:40.944 --> 54:42.537
<i>What do we have here?</i>

54:43.613 --> 54:46.844
<i>Hey, check it out.
A little man.</i>

54:46.916 --> 54:48.577
( sniffs )

54:51.454 --> 54:53.183
SAM: Oh, hello!

54:53.256 --> 54:54.883
You're not going to
sit on me, are you?

54:54.958 --> 54:58.656
Come on! Wake up!
Wake up!

54:58.728 --> 55:00.127
Dylan!

55:00.196 --> 55:01.391
Oh, come on, man.

55:01.464 --> 55:04.729
I was just dreaming that I was
jamming out with McCartney.

55:04.801 --> 55:07.600
We couldn't see
where we were last night,

55:07.671 --> 55:08.661
but look!

55:08.738 --> 55:10.399
BRIAN: Closer than we ever knew!

55:10.473 --> 55:13.966
DOOGAL: There's the carousel!
Let's get down there and help Florence!

55:14.044 --> 55:15.739
Home,

55:15.812 --> 55:18.304
sweet frozen home!

55:20.984 --> 55:23.351
That diamond's
got to be here somewhere.

55:24.654 --> 55:27.715
Be easier to find if some idiot
hadn't frozen it solid!

55:27.791 --> 55:29.759
Oh...that was me.

55:29.826 --> 55:30.918
SAM: Zeebad!

55:30.994 --> 55:33.964
This wasteland isn't big enough
for the both of us!

55:34.030 --> 55:36.965
Look, when I leave someone for dead,

55:37.033 --> 55:39.627
I expect them to die!

55:39.703 --> 55:42.297
You can't even do that right, can you?

55:42.372 --> 55:45.467
I haven't done anything right
since I left the carousel.

55:45.542 --> 55:48.170
Now it's time
to resume my post!

55:48.244 --> 55:50.975
You? You did something right
on the carousel?

55:51.047 --> 55:52.310
Indeed, sir.

55:52.382 --> 55:54.350
Guarding it from the likes of you.

55:54.417 --> 55:56.647
( Chuckles )
You, a guard!

55:56.720 --> 55:58.711
You couldn't guard
against underarm odor.

55:58.788 --> 56:01.519
Well, personal hygiene
in the field is difficult.

56:02.025 --> 56:03.584
But it's like Zebedee told me--

56:03.660 --> 56:05.651
it's what's inside that counts.

56:06.262 --> 56:09.960
Charge!

56:12.635 --> 56:13.625
Ohh!

56:15.772 --> 56:17.262
( Groans )

56:18.341 --> 56:20.139
Just like old times, sir.

56:20.210 --> 56:21.200
No!

56:22.278 --> 56:24.474

lost you, too, Doogal.

01:04:34.804 --> 01:04:36.670
But you saved my life...

A narrator is a rather grand word,
really, for storyteller.

01:09:30.733 --> 01:09:33.600
Ah! This is the only guitar riff I know!

01:09:34.103 --> 01:09:38.198

I mean, I'd turn the pages and I'd think,
"Oh, you're so cute!"

01:09:52.688 --> 01:09:56.784
Mmm! Like a rotting Smurf
wrapped in cabbage!

01:09:56.859 --> 01:09:59.885

Oh...that was me.

01:10:01.964 --> 01:10:04.433
Not me. The only tricks
I know are, "Sit, Doogal,"

01:10:04.500 --> 01:10:06.525
and chasing my tail
till I pass out.

01:10:07.102 --> 01:10:10.265
Are you saying I represent athletes,
but I'm not an athlete?

01:10:27.723 --> 01:10:29.157
Not that I need it.

01:10:29.225 --> 01:10:32.058
She's a cow.
I am a cow.

01:10:32.127 --> 01:10:34.994
I felt a connection, cow to cow.
