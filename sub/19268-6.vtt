[Modigliani's Woman] 

01:15.270 --> 01:17.030
<i>Why are you getting the phone now! </i>

01:17.030 --> 01:18.300
<i>Where are you right now? </i>

01:18.300 --> 01:20.290
You've called the wrong number. 

01:20.890 --> 01:22.820
<i>Stop joking around. </i>

01:22.820 --> 01:25.200
<i>There's a murder case right now...
Where are you going to be? </i>

01:25.200 --> 01:27.450
<i>Since Yeh Ri is near Gangnam right now, </i>

01:27.450 --> 01:29.070
<i>I think you can head over there. </i>

01:29.070 --> 01:31.380
Happy families are similar. 

01:31.380 --> 01:34.490
But unhappy families are unhappy for their own reasons. 

01:34.490 --> 01:37.480
Don't you think the first line of the book gives away the whole story, 

01:37.480 --> 01:38.990
Mr. Baek? 

01:41.020 --> 01:42.110
Yes. 

01:42.110 --> 01:43.450
Please sit down. 

01:50.630 --> 01:53.190
Ah, no. I mean, your phone. 

01:59.470 --> 02:01.280
Don't you have an emergency? 

02:01.280 --> 02:02.650
No, no. no. 

02:02.930 --> 02:03.950
Not at all. 

02:06.080 --> 02:07.410
Ms. Choi? 

02:10.039 --> 02:11.570
Your impression is very... 

02:15.450 --> 02:16.340
I'm sorry. 

02:20.870 --> 02:22.650
They're very 

02:22.650 --> 02:24.310
diligent. 

02:24.310 --> 02:26.890
Working so hard even on a Sunday. 

02:33.890 --> 02:36.440
Would you like some coffee? 

02:36.440 --> 02:37.420
Yes. 

02:39.450 --> 02:40.620
Excuse me. 

02:41.370 --> 02:42.370
Waiter! 

02:43.640 --> 02:45.050
Right now. 

02:45.050 --> 02:47.190
I don't injure people. 

02:47.190 --> 02:49.500
Although I do some rough work. 

02:49.500 --> 02:50.710
Huh? 

02:52.550 --> 02:55.580
Of course it's awkward when people meet for the first time and 

02:55.580 --> 02:58.710
it's especially difficult to be comfortable in a place like this. 

03:01.140 --> 03:02.840
Yes, it is. 

03:02.840 --> 03:04.850
I heard you're a public official? 

03:04.850 --> 03:06.450
What kind of work do you do? 

03:08.980 --> 03:10.410
Oh, that's... 

03:10.990 --> 03:12.570
Oh, that's... 

03:15.300 --> 03:19.040
[The Rose War] 

03:31.340 --> 03:33.780
Seems like he experienced hell before he even died. 

03:44.550 --> 03:46.260
Deceased Jae Min Sung 

03:46.260 --> 03:50.850
is an attorney who does technology patent litigation against large corporations. 

03:50.850 --> 03:52.920
Duration of action, 3 years. 

03:53.980 --> 03:56.880
The litigation cost several hundred billion won.

04:20.920 --> 04:22.720
It's definitely a homicide. 

04:22.720 --> 04:28.040
So, it seems both sides were anxious to pull some strings. 

04:28.040 --> 04:30.630
Since we have attention here and there, 

04:30.630 --> 04:32.630
we'll have to handle this matter quickly. 

04:48.450 --> 04:53.420
We're going to have to find another case motivation. 

04:55.750 --> 04:57.550
At the moment of the death, the victim 

04:57.550 --> 04:59.670
focused on the suspect through that window. 

05:02.240 --> 05:06.240
The suspect, while sitting on this chair, 

05:06.240 --> 05:08.750
observed the dying victim. 

05:10.280 --> 05:12.270
Two kinds of perspectives. 

05:17.380 --> 05:19.780
There must have been a large temperature difference. 

05:27.240 --> 05:29.210
Ah, damn. 

05:29.210 --> 05:31.600
Can't get away from my fate. 

05:32.670 --> 05:35.220
Sigh. There are no Sundays for detectives. 

05:39.300 --> 05:40.900
Where was that place again? 

05:44.600 --> 05:45.830
Oh no. 

05:45.830 --> 05:46.940
My phone. 

05:58.180 --> 06:00.600
Stop, stop, stop. Stop. 

06:01.490 --> 06:04.490
Is there a murder case today in Gangnam? 

06:05.620 --> 06:08.860
According to the security cameras, 

06:08.860 --> 06:10.810
Jae Min Sung's car arrived Friday, 11:14 pm. 

06:10.810 --> 06:14.140
And the time of leave was Saturday, 5:38 am. 

06:14.140 --> 06:17.340
After that, I think he left his car here and ran away. 

06:18.590 --> 06:21.210
And there's no evidence of contact with another car. 

06:22.910 --> 06:24.130
<i>Director. </i>

06:24.130 --> 06:25.450
<i>If </i>

06:25.450 --> 06:27.800
the suspect used Jae Min Sung's car 

06:27.800 --> 06:31.670
to go in and out of the crime scene 

06:31.670 --> 06:33.750
It means after capturing Jae Min Sung from wherever, 

06:33.750 --> 06:35.890
he completed the murder here. 

06:35.890 --> 06:38.240
<i>Detective Park, first find out about his profile. </i>

06:38.240 --> 06:39.410
Yes, sir. 

06:39.410 --> 06:40.300
And, also. 

06:40.300 --> 06:41.380
What about Detective Baek? 

06:41.380 --> 06:42.790
Oh, that. 

06:42.790 --> 06:44.840
I'm still contacting him, but 

06:45.600 --> 06:46.370
Okay. 

06:52.640 --> 06:56.170
As the burn edema occurred in the chest, 

06:56.170 --> 06:59.090
he died from breathing difficulties. 

06:59.280 --> 07:01.600
He watched him until he died. 

07:04.520 --> 07:06.420
I saw body wounds. 

07:06.420 --> 07:08.370
They're called heat ruptures. 

07:08.370 --> 07:12.540
As the blood tissues burn, the skin ruptures from the heat vapors. 

07:12.540 --> 07:14.660
When you steam dumplings, they burst. 

07:14.660 --> 07:16.900
Well, it's similar to that. 

07:16.900 --> 07:18.090
What about drugs? 

07:18.870 --> 07:20.340
From the refined components of the blood, 

07:20.340 --> 07:22.220
tetroxin was detected. 

07:22.220 --> 07:25.400
The hallucinogenic components are implicitly used for fatigue. 

07:25.400 --> 07:28.890
But, depending on the usage you can fall asleep or also die. 

07:28.890 --> 07:31.720
You can assume the suspect used it to gain control. 

07:31.720 --> 07:33.340
The area of injection is unique. 

07:33.340 --> 07:35.570
Over here, behind the ankle. 

07:59.630 --> 08:03.180
Perhaps, among your recent cases 
were there bad relationships...? 

08:03.180 --> 08:06.680
That night, the wife called the office two or three times. 

08:09.470 --> 08:11.700
Not the cell phone, but the office? 

08:11.700 --> 08:12.820
Yes. 

08:12.820 --> 08:14.660
I told her I would transfer her call, 

08:14.660 --> 08:16.660
but she said it was okay and just hung up. 

08:19.930 --> 08:21.060
But... 

08:21.900 --> 08:24.690
What is your relationship with Attorney Sung? 

08:24.690 --> 08:25.920
Huh? 

08:26.720 --> 08:27.920
Why would you... 

08:29.940 --> 08:31.180
That gift. 

08:31.180 --> 08:32.150
He gave it to you, right? 

08:34.200 --> 08:37.000
I just liked him secretly. 

08:38.100 --> 08:40.090
Attorney Sung 

08:40.090 --> 08:42.900
said he's too scared of his wife to cheat on her. 

08:44.860 --> 08:47.070
Was their marriage unhealthy? 

08:47.590 --> 08:48.760
Yes. 

08:48.760 --> 08:50.760
even more after that incident happened. 

08:53.360 --> 08:54.490
Min Ho. 

08:54.490 --> 08:55.630
Are you still in Yang Pyang? 

08:55.630 --> 08:56.870
I have something to check. 

08:56.870 --> 08:58.810
A month ago, at a sauna resort 

08:58.810 --> 09:01.250
Jae Min's wife had the same accident. 

09:01.250 --> 09:02.250
Yes. 

09:02.250 --> 09:03.590
I'll go check. 

09:03.590 --> 09:04.910
Then, I'll see you later. 

09:04.910 --> 09:05.600
Good luck. 

09:08.670 --> 09:09.520
See you later? 

09:12.040 --> 09:15.390
Ah! What do I do? 

09:15.650 --> 09:17.120
What do I do? What do I do? 

09:18.060 --> 09:19.480
Okay, okay, okay. 

09:19.480 --> 09:21.190
What do I do? What do I do? 

09:21.190 --> 09:22.850
Oh, you're going to lose your voice. 

09:23.570 --> 09:24.980
Is that his wife? 

09:24.980 --> 09:27.500
It's too soon to be wailing. 

09:36.950 --> 09:38.490
Detective Poison,
what are you doing here?

09:39.610 --> 09:41.490
Are you here to buy gifts?

09:42.900 --> 09:44.240
What are you doing here?

09:45.060 --> 09:46.240
Don't we have the Ten Team here?

09:46.240 --> 09:49.390
The Ten Team for a robbery case?

09:49.390 --> 09:51.550
He should've just left quietly with the goods.

09:51.550 --> 09:52.690
He had to go on and kill somebody.

09:52.690 --> 09:55.640
His wife looks like she's going to die right in front of us.

09:56.110 --> 09:57.150
Scaredy cat.

09:57.690 --> 09:58.900
These days detectives don't catch the criminals.

09:58.900 --> 10:00.090
The security cameras do.

10:00.500 --> 10:03.030
The timing was amazingly perfect.

10:03.030 --> 10:04.720
He waited until the owner pulled down the shutters

10:04.720 --> 10:06.880
and exited through the back door to attack.

10:06.880 --> 10:08.880
He's an expert.

10:09.770 --> 10:11.610
Nevermind that.

10:11.610 --> 10:13.370
Make a call for me.

10:13.370 --> 10:14.210
To where?

10:14.770 --> 10:15.900
To my team.

10:16.850 --> 10:18.160
The old man called.

10:18.160 --> 10:19.960
He says the stolen goods are in Young Deung Po.

10:19.960 --> 10:21.370
Tell them to secure it tightly.

10:21.370 --> 10:23.790
If it's lost
it'll be the end of them.

10:24.740 --> 10:26.040
Let's go.

10:26.040 --> 10:28.040
Take that guy home.

10:30.770 --> 10:32.520
The stolen goods turned up already?

10:34.510 --> 10:36.310
If he even killed a person,

10:37.910 --> 10:39.760
the risk is too high.

10:40.890 --> 10:43.270
He just exposes the goods like that?

11:18.690 --> 11:20.740
If aiming for the owners whereabouts,

11:20.740 --> 11:22.750
getting the passcode to the safe

11:22.750 --> 11:25.540
and taking the most expensive goods is more logical.

11:28.330 --> 11:30.380
He doesn't even touch the safe. 

11:31.380 --> 11:33.760
He only swiped the cheap ones on display? 

11:37.260 --> 11:39.100
This isn't a theft murder case. 

11:40.960 --> 11:43.250
It was a robbery committed to disguise the murder. 

11:43.790 --> 11:46.190
Aside from these, 

11:46.190 --> 11:47.940
are there other emergency exits? 

11:47.940 --> 11:50.490
No, these are the only ones. 

11:53.580 --> 11:55.700
Then, at the time the suspect is getting away, 

11:55.700 --> 11:58.080
how can there be no cars or people leaving? 

12:19.960 --> 12:21.850
Would you like a cup of tea? 

12:23.340 --> 12:25.890
No, I'm fine. Thank you. 

12:25.890 --> 12:28.070
I happen to have really good tea. 

12:29.040 --> 12:31.290
There's bergamot oil in it, 

12:31.290 --> 12:32.720
so the fragrance is excellent. 

12:35.450 --> 12:37.130
I'm sorry, but 

12:37.130 --> 12:39.710
I'm not here as a guest. 

12:42.100 --> 12:44.550
They say it was Saturday dawn, right? 

12:44.550 --> 12:46.650
When my husband died. 

12:46.650 --> 12:48.380
Then, 

12:49.200 --> 12:51.420
there's a day and a half left. 

12:52.180 --> 12:53.720
For what? 

12:53.720 --> 12:57.150
Until his spirit remains here. 

12:57.820 --> 13:00.570
When the body dies and 4 days pass, 

13:01.170 --> 13:02.570
the soul 

13:02.570 --> 13:04.570
is gone forever. 

13:05.760 --> 13:08.120
I want to wait until then. 

13:09.910 --> 13:11.230
You'll help me, right? 

13:16.480 --> 13:17.820
But, 

13:17.820 --> 13:19.820
I don't see your child anywhere. 

13:21.930 --> 13:25.150
These days as soon as children enter school, 

13:25.150 --> 13:27.150
it's like war. 

13:28.180 --> 13:31.100
However, my daughter Hye Jin is 

13:31.100 --> 13:33.500
with the angels. 

13:33.500 --> 13:35.580
Death nor pain. 

13:35.580 --> 13:37.580
A place without any danger. 

13:39.940 --> 13:42.090
It was three years ago. 

13:42.090 --> 13:44.620
After a preschool camping trip, 

13:44.620 --> 13:46.150
she drowned. 

13:49.260 --> 13:52.110
I'd like to take a look at Jae Min's room. 

14:08.920 --> 14:10.340
I can't find it. 

14:10.950 --> 14:12.340
What should we do? 

14:17.800 --> 14:20.420
As the suspect was abandoning Jae Min's car and getting away, 

14:20.420 --> 14:22.280
he seized the black box. 

14:22.280 --> 14:25.630
So, it wasn't easy figuring out the details of the victim. 

14:25.630 --> 14:28.720
When and where the suspect got in that car. 

14:28.720 --> 14:31.670
Finding the starting time of the crime is the assignment. 

14:31.670 --> 14:34.020
One thing that caught my attention is that 

14:34.020 --> 14:36.850
the victim's last destination on his navigation system was 

14:36.850 --> 14:39.470
the city outskirts in Buwon, the night before. 

14:39.470 --> 14:43.970
Since there's a high chance the victim was unconscious 

14:43.970 --> 14:45.310
when taken to the villa, 

14:45.310 --> 14:47.820
it probably meant the suspect already knew where to drive. 

14:49.030 --> 14:50.840
Min Ho, what about that thing before? 

14:52.640 --> 14:56.980
Oh. Jae Min's wife was trapped in that sauna before. 

14:56.980 --> 14:58.480
Oh. That... 

14:58.480 --> 15:01.530
The locksmith said it was because the door was broken. 

15:01.530 --> 15:03.230
And he said it was always like that. 

15:03.230 --> 15:04.690
So, it hasn't been in use for a long time. 

15:05.460 --> 15:08.060
Even at the time of rescue,
it wasn't an emergency. 

15:08.060 --> 15:11.020
Looking at it objectively,
this was just a small accident. 

15:11.970 --> 15:14.190
The accident may be objective. 

15:14.190 --> 15:16.770
But the pain is subjective. 

15:16.770 --> 15:19.620
Victim Jae Min Sung's attorney has arrived. 

15:31.620 --> 15:33.530
That's Jae Min's will. 

15:33.710 --> 15:34.980
<i>Will and Testament </i>

15:34.980 --> 15:37.240
...donating his entire will to society. 

15:38.110 --> 15:39.840
Autopsy and investigation? 

15:50.870 --> 15:52.790
Me and my nosiness. 

16:20.920 --> 16:22.690
The light didn't turn on. 

16:44.300 --> 16:46.130
Hey! Over here! 

16:47.130 --> 16:50.500
Stand right over here. 

16:54.350 --> 16:56.320
Over here. Don't move! 

16:56.730 --> 16:58.520
You went too far! 

16:59.210 --> 17:01.490
To the left. Just a little to the left. 

17:01.490 --> 17:02.740
STOP! 

17:02.740 --> 17:04.599
Stand still. Don't move. 

17:12.150 --> 17:13.530
Huh, this bastard. 

17:14.390 --> 17:15.710
You didn't leave. 

17:25.550 --> 17:30.760
Time of crime.
From 8:58 pm to 9:29 pm. 

17:32.060 --> 17:34.500
He was hiding there for 30 minutes. 

17:37.420 --> 17:38.460
Why? 

17:39.130 --> 17:43.450
In a scene like this,
there would've been blood on him. 

17:45.880 --> 17:49.640
If he wanted to avoid the security cameras and people's attention, 

17:50.740 --> 17:53.050
not the elevator 

17:54.460 --> 17:56.250
nor the escalator. 

17:56.920 --> 17:58.250
Then? 

18:12.640 --> 18:14.370
He came through here. 

18:23.590 --> 18:24.860
It's locked. 

18:27.590 --> 18:29.600
It doesn't open from here. 

19:04.820 --> 19:06.460
I'm dying. 

19:12.040 --> 19:14.250
This bastard. 

19:35.560 --> 19:38.920
The movie in the first theater ends at 9:30 pm. 

19:38.920 --> 19:40.930
The places where the emergency exits open are 

19:40.930 --> 19:43.590
the first floor and the underground parking lot. 

19:44.390 --> 19:46.660
A robbery committed to disguise murder. 

19:47.590 --> 19:50.770
Strategically planned scene for timed escape. 

19:52.170 --> 19:55.650
If he even prepared for a rainy day, then 

19:59.740 --> 20:02.210
This guy's a mastermind. 

20:03.420 --> 20:06.440
A national mastermind at that. 

20:07.540 --> 20:11.010
[Blue-eyed Lady] 

20:12.280 --> 20:14.070
Soon Jah Choi 

20:15.050 --> 20:18.960
Jae Min's mother died from being stricken. 

20:18.960 --> 20:19.980
On the street. 

20:21.920 --> 20:25.340
His mother's murder was January 15, 2005. 

20:25.340 --> 20:28.830
The two people registered their marriage on January 20, 2005. 

20:30.380 --> 20:33.730
The 2 year old daughter was also 
later added to Jae Min's family registry. 

20:33.730 --> 20:37.930
Right after a funeral, 
registering a marriage isn't very common. 

20:37.930 --> 20:40.220
Was she waiting for her mother in law's death? 

20:40.220 --> 20:41.400
In addition, 

20:41.400 --> 20:45.000
the preschool principal,
who avoided any responsibility about the daughter's death, 

20:45.000 --> 20:46.880
wrote a letter of apology and 

20:46.880 --> 20:48.880
committed suicide at the Han River. 

20:50.440 --> 20:53.640
The daughter's death,
August 2010. 

20:53.640 --> 20:56.110
The principals suicide, October. 

20:56.110 --> 21:00.000
Jae Min's first time writing his will was October 2010. 

21:00.800 --> 21:04.320
At about this time, Jae Min became scared of his wife. 

21:05.600 --> 21:08.410
His wife, who carried around the shadow of death. 

21:09.130 --> 21:11.890
The mother in law, who opposed the marriage 

21:11.890 --> 21:14.030
by even assaulting Sun Hwa Yang, 

21:14.030 --> 21:15.940
gets hit by a brick and immediately dies. 

21:15.940 --> 21:18.940
The principal, who avoided responsibility for 

21:18.940 --> 21:21.510
her daughter's drowning, jumps in the water and commits suicide. 

21:21.510 --> 21:25.490
The husband, who was at the scene of Sun Hwa's sauna accident, 

21:25.490 --> 21:27.780
is killed in the sauna. 

21:29.080 --> 21:30.750
An eye for an eye. 

21:30.750 --> 21:32.750
A tooth for a tooth.
Is that what this means? 

21:35.180 --> 21:36.260
Is it a coincidence, 

21:36.260 --> 21:38.260
all these deaths? 

21:39.590 --> 21:41.260
I need to meet Sun Hwa. 

21:41.910 --> 21:43.260
Thank you. 

21:45.520 --> 21:47.510
Oh, geez. 

21:47.510 --> 21:50.310
Out of all the coffee shops in this area, 

21:50.310 --> 21:53.770
he goes to the one without security cameras. 

21:53.770 --> 21:56.200
Who the heck did he meet? 

21:56.200 --> 21:58.770
$7.50 shaved ice. 

21:58.770 --> 22:00.630
Single size. 

22:04.240 --> 22:06.550
Did he come first and wait for someone? 

22:13.000 --> 22:17.560
Why was he at this coffee shop for over an hour and a half? 

22:17.560 --> 22:20.220
There are no security cameras. 

22:20.220 --> 22:22.220
The person he's meeting isn't clear either. 

22:39.920 --> 22:41.020
Hey, mister. 

22:41.950 --> 22:44.050
I have a dirty fate. 

22:44.870 --> 22:46.050
It's dirty. 

22:46.050 --> 22:48.330
I didn't even know my husband died, 

22:48.330 --> 22:50.990
I was preparing my mother's ancestral rites table. 

22:50.990 --> 22:53.930
I mean, does this make... 

22:53.930 --> 22:55.350
You scared me. 

22:55.350 --> 22:57.710
Oh, the glare. 

22:58.580 --> 22:59.710
Stupid. 

23:01.210 --> 23:04.410
Let's talk when you're sober.
SOBER. 

23:04.410 --> 23:05.800
Mister. 

23:05.800 --> 23:08.140
I don't know anything. 

23:08.140 --> 23:09.470
For real. 

23:09.470 --> 23:11.470
Why are they all doing this to me? 

23:22.820 --> 23:24.550
Is this lady always like this? 

23:25.320 --> 23:27.230
Lady, my butt. 

23:27.230 --> 23:30.580
She runs a karaoke and holds the mic all day. 

23:30.580 --> 23:33.840
A man marrying at almost 60.
What's up with that? 

23:33.840 --> 23:38.170
He kicked out all his kids who didn't like her. 

23:38.170 --> 23:40.170
Then, he must've been really good to her. 

23:40.170 --> 23:42.450
She's a precious new bride. 

23:42.450 --> 23:46.000
She probably believed everything and came into the family. 

23:46.000 --> 23:47.790
But who did she think she was? 

23:47.790 --> 23:50.600
She doesn't know anything about Mr. Kim. 

23:50.600 --> 23:52.440
That man Mr. Kim... 

23:52.440 --> 23:53.760
When his daughter was getting married, 

23:53.760 --> 23:56.160
he wanted a wedding gift fee from his son in law, 

23:56.160 --> 23:57.870
after a 20% discount. 

24:04.370 --> 24:05.450
On Friday, 

24:05.450 --> 24:07.290
you didn't hear anything? 

24:07.290 --> 24:08.790
You work until then. 

24:08.790 --> 24:10.190
Friday? 

24:10.190 --> 24:12.870
We have too many drinking customers on Fridays. 

24:12.870 --> 24:14.120
Crazy Friday. 

24:15.750 --> 24:17.110
Last ingestion? 

24:18.190 --> 24:21.650
<i>Listening to your voice,
it sounds like you're onto something. </i>

24:23.010 --> 24:23.960
It's here. 

24:25.330 --> 24:27.230
A hamburger and soda. 

24:28.660 --> 24:31.580
So you're saying it's not shaved ice, but hamburger? 

24:32.530 --> 24:33.970
Yes, yes. Thank you. 

24:36.290 --> 24:37.800
Yeah. 

24:37.800 --> 24:41.110
It wasn't Jae Min at the coffee shop.
It was the suspect. 

24:42.490 --> 24:44.940
Min Ho, you're onto something! 

24:53.670 --> 24:55.100
Hey, Park. 

24:55.100 --> 24:56.290
Detective Baek. 

24:56.290 --> 24:57.720
What are you doing right now? 

24:58.370 --> 24:59.860
Right here? 

25:00.960 --> 25:03.140
Um. Then, then. 

25:03.140 --> 25:04.570
What about you? 

25:04.570 --> 25:05.650
Me? 

25:07.160 --> 25:10.190
There was another murder in this building on the same day? 

25:10.750 --> 25:12.230
That's interesting. 

25:12.230 --> 25:16.270
The suspect of that case 
was at a coffee shop in this building for over an hour? 

25:18.750 --> 25:20.980
He was probably busy killing somebody. 
Why would he do that? 

25:23.530 --> 25:24.900
That's that. 

25:24.900 --> 25:27.660
Is it everything if only you figure things out? 

25:28.680 --> 25:31.880
That. I mean. 

25:31.880 --> 25:33.150
So, I'm saying, 

25:33.150 --> 25:36.100
even without you, I'm getting to the core of this,  

25:36.100 --> 25:38.350
but this isn't fair. 

25:39.600 --> 25:40.850
Whatever. 

25:42.690 --> 25:43.790
You. 

25:43.790 --> 25:45.160
Pretend you never saw me here today. 

25:45.160 --> 25:46.210
Why? 

25:47.660 --> 25:49.850
I'm going to be recognized as a national. 

25:52.720 --> 25:53.700
Min Ho. 

25:53.700 --> 25:56.100
Do me a favor. 

25:56.100 --> 25:58.220
I have a victim named Ji Hye Hyun. 

25:58.220 --> 26:00.620
Find out her call records and work records. 

26:01.390 --> 26:04.510
I don't do stuff like that anymore. 

26:06.090 --> 26:07.380
Then who's going to do it? 

26:07.990 --> 26:08.790
Do it. 

26:21.440 --> 26:22.930
You hated your husband, right? 

26:29.010 --> 26:30.600
Is that what the secretary said? 

26:32.270 --> 26:34.170
If I said everything was fine, 

26:34.870 --> 26:36.340
that would be a lie. 

26:37.240 --> 26:38.710
Truthfully, 

26:39.490 --> 26:41.220
after the sauna accident, 

26:42.060 --> 26:45.630
it was difficult to face my husband. 

26:49.850 --> 26:52.160
Are you okay?
Wake up. 

26:52.160 --> 26:54.690
I was trapped inside, but 

26:54.690 --> 26:59.060
I kept seeing my husband step away. 

26:59.930 --> 27:05.400
However, I was thinking about resolving this matter soon. 

27:05.830 --> 27:08.140
There are various ways to resolve this. 

27:08.920 --> 27:10.970
The day your husband died, 

27:10.970 --> 27:12.970
what were you doing? 

27:14.390 --> 27:16.680
I was frustrated, so 

27:16.680 --> 27:18.680
I went out for some fresh air. 

27:20.550 --> 27:21.890
Of course. 

27:22.520 --> 27:23.890
You went alone? 

27:24.680 --> 27:26.170
Am I 

27:26.170 --> 27:28.170
the murder suspect? 

27:29.790 --> 27:31.510
That answer, 

27:32.640 --> 27:34.460
you can hear from your husband. 

27:45.890 --> 27:46.970
This... 

27:48.490 --> 27:50.560
What does this mean? 

27:50.560 --> 27:53.610
The wife is seeking happiness, but 

27:53.610 --> 27:56.660
why would he die from fear and suffocation? 

27:58.260 --> 27:59.860
Are you happy? 

28:01.550 --> 28:03.620
Everyone you hate dies. 

28:04.700 --> 28:08.210
The violent mother in law who didn't accept you. 

28:08.210 --> 28:09.640
And the preschool principal. 

28:09.640 --> 28:11.210
Lastly, your husband. 

28:21.440 --> 28:23.760
Dying if you hate somebody. 

28:35.080 --> 28:36.510
Our Hye Jin. 

28:37.200 --> 28:38.630
Did you hate her too? 

28:44.450 --> 28:46.280
There is no more reason 

28:46.280 --> 28:48.730
for me to stay here. 

28:48.730 --> 28:50.730
We decide that. 

28:54.590 --> 28:57.530
I hope the suspect doesn't get caught. 

28:57.530 --> 29:00.010
Even after Jae Min's death, 

29:00.010 --> 29:01.480
unjustly 

29:01.480 --> 29:03.480
bitterly 

29:03.480 --> 29:06.310
the corpse will get exhausted. 

29:06.310 --> 29:08.790
Little kids 

29:08.790 --> 29:11.020
will trample all over 

29:11.740 --> 29:15.470
leaving not even a piece of bone. 

29:17.510 --> 29:19.580
Are you running away? 

29:23.190 --> 29:24.730
You still didn't answer. 

29:27.430 --> 29:29.420
Are you happy right now? 

29:36.340 --> 29:38.370
If the person you hate dies, 

29:39.970 --> 29:42.550
do you think you'll be happy? 

29:54.830 --> 29:57.080
We're reading the modifications on the credit adjustment. 

29:57.080 --> 30:00.060
<i>She was trying to pull out a loan. </i>

30:00.060 --> 30:01.380
How much? 

30:02.070 --> 30:03.090
150,000,000 won. 

30:03.090 --> 30:04.410
150,000,000 won? 

30:07.820 --> 30:09.960
Anything odd from her call records? 

30:09.960 --> 30:11.150
There is! 

30:11.150 --> 30:13.720
011-8728-4424 

30:14.550 --> 30:19.500
A month ago when borrowing money,
there were 2 call records. 

30:19.500 --> 30:22.700
The owner of that number is a 71 year old grandma. 

30:22.700 --> 30:25.180
But she died 6 months ago. 

30:25.180 --> 30:26.660
Soul phone. 

30:27.260 --> 30:30.500
More famous than the Cannon phone. Soul phone. 

30:31.350 --> 30:34.140
In addition, it's a 011 number that we can't trace. 

30:38.350 --> 30:40.990
We'll be getting order calls right now. 

30:40.990 --> 30:43.130
I'm back. 

30:47.710 --> 30:48.930
Give me your phone. 

30:49.160 --> 30:50.830
Huh? Oh, uh. 

31:00.490 --> 31:01.420
Hello? 

31:01.420 --> 31:02.480
<i>Yes, who is this? </i>

31:02.480 --> 31:04.430
Yes. I'm calling at someone's referral. 

31:04.430 --> 31:05.420
<i>You got the wrong number. </i>

31:05.420 --> 31:07.950
Wait, isn't this a place where you do work for someone else? 

31:07.950 --> 31:09.190
<i>No, it's not. </i>

31:13.210 --> 31:16.710
He doesn't even ask why I'm calling and just hangs up. 

31:17.690 --> 31:21.690
But, why are you using my phone instead of yours? 

31:21.690 --> 31:23.690
It's tough.
Let's help each other out. 

31:34.570 --> 31:35.480
Hello? 

31:36.130 --> 31:39.590
<i>Getting the princess treatment. </i>

31:39.590 --> 31:42.940
<i>How's your injured arm?
Is it better? </i>

33:20.520 --> 33:24.370
<i>Director Yeo, we got Sun Hwa Yang's alibi. </i>

33:24.370 --> 33:28.050
As she said, she was far from the scene at the time of the crime. 

33:28.050 --> 33:29.650
At a train station at Gang Neung. 

33:29.650 --> 33:32.310
She was caught on their security camera. 

33:32.310 --> 33:33.470
Okay. 

33:50.010 --> 33:51.510
Who are you? 

33:54.160 --> 33:55.350
I'm a cop. 

33:56.610 --> 34:00.830
Detective, I'm just giving her some vitamins. 

34:00.830 --> 34:04.260
These are all purchased legally. 

34:04.260 --> 34:08.239
I just came to see Ji Hye Hyun. 

34:09.780 --> 34:11.100
Ji Hye Hyun. 

34:11.870 --> 34:13.969
You recently had an extravagant spending, right? 

34:14.960 --> 34:16.540
Oh, she's sleeping. 

34:17.909 --> 34:19.940
You have to leave with me. 

34:19.940 --> 34:21.469
Ji Hye! 

34:26.489 --> 34:27.620
Hey. 

34:44.610 --> 34:47.940
Hey, Half moon. That's enough.
You'll get beaten to death. 

34:52.370 --> 34:54.489
What, you little punks? 

34:56.350 --> 34:58.940
Do Shik, what's going on? 

34:58.940 --> 35:00.370
Let's have a talk. 

35:05.390 --> 35:07.460
They're called Hit Lin. 

35:07.460 --> 35:09.910
They came over from China. 

35:10.710 --> 35:12.890
You can never catch them. 

35:17.130 --> 35:19.100
That's a lame answer. 

35:22.100 --> 35:24.910
From the guy who started this, the Korean broker, 

35:24.910 --> 35:26.530
the coach and athletes. 

35:26.530 --> 35:28.290
This is extremely complicated. 

35:28.290 --> 35:31.250
With this scope, the whole police will be on top of this. 

35:31.250 --> 35:33.170
It's not like you get anything out of the crime scene 

35:33.170 --> 35:35.170
of have money to chase after. 

35:39.030 --> 35:41.320
You need to close your eyes when I do that. 

35:42.950 --> 35:45.000
How do I catch the suspect with my eyes closed? 

35:47.900 --> 35:49.320
It seems 

35:49.320 --> 35:53.280
this guy lives in the area due to the crime timing and profile work. 

35:53.280 --> 35:56.240
Unless someone told you,
you can never figure this out. 

35:56.240 --> 35:58.170
Don't get involved and look for some work. 

35:58.170 --> 35:59.570
I'll look too. 

36:02.840 --> 36:04.980
Relax you eyes. 

36:04.980 --> 36:06.430
Lift a finger, 

36:08.090 --> 36:10.210
and you're done for. 

36:11.400 --> 36:12.350
Jerk. 

36:12.980 --> 36:15.810
To say such unfortunate things when I haven't even married. 

36:15.810 --> 36:17.890
What would you get married for? 

36:17.890 --> 36:20.940
Half the people who hire for these things to happen 

36:20.940 --> 36:23.570
are wives or husbands. 

36:25.350 --> 36:26.860
Don't do it. 

36:29.780 --> 36:31.900
Wow, Min Ho. 

36:31.900 --> 36:34.230
How did you think of finding out the coffee shop order 

36:34.230 --> 36:36.850
and victim's last ingestion at that moment? 

36:42.450 --> 36:44.110
Anyway, so... 

36:44.110 --> 36:47.420
if the suspect used Jae Min's credit card at the coffee shop, 

36:47.420 --> 36:49.410
the start of the crime is here. 

36:49.410 --> 36:51.580
Somewhere between Jae Min's house 

36:51.580 --> 36:53.670
and arrival at the coffee shop. 

36:55.660 --> 36:56.660
Wait. 

37:00.120 --> 37:01.950
Play that again for me. 

37:14.470 --> 37:16.360
Man, must've been in a hurry. 

37:16.960 --> 37:20.660
That car has a high RPM, 
so it's common sense to press the gas lightly. 

37:22.990 --> 37:24.810
Wait. 

37:24.810 --> 37:27.300
There was a scratch on Jae Min's abandoned car. 

37:29.700 --> 37:31.430
Play the recording from the night before. 

37:43.880 --> 37:45.850
He wasn't in a hurry. 

37:45.850 --> 37:47.530
He wasn't used to driving the car. 

37:47.530 --> 37:48.570
Then. 

37:49.440 --> 37:51.900
Let's find out who this unskilled driver is. 

38:08.790 --> 38:10.110
Where did everyone go? 

38:16.080 --> 38:17.110
Eun Jung? 

38:18.630 --> 38:19.620
Yes? 

38:20.850 --> 38:22.610
Can I see you for a minute? 

38:29.310 --> 38:31.190
Your light bulb's broken. 

38:31.190 --> 38:33.050
Did you know that? 

38:33.050 --> 38:34.350
I'm not sure. 

38:34.350 --> 38:37.160
I don't really come in here. 

38:37.160 --> 38:39.600
My husband always did the driving. 

38:39.600 --> 38:41.130
Then you must not be a very good at driving. 

38:56.600 --> 38:58.390
This is the start. 

39:01.720 --> 39:04.900
The car left the garage at 7:09 pm. 

39:04.900 --> 39:07.100
At that time, Sun Hwa was at Gang Neung Station. 

39:08.030 --> 39:11.650
Then who was the driver? 

39:11.650 --> 39:13.650
There must have been someone. 

39:14.630 --> 39:18.240
Someone who knows Jae Min very well. 

39:38.150 --> 39:40.530
Let's take a look here. 

39:40.530 --> 39:44.960
It's not very easy to change a style of murder. 

39:46.150 --> 39:48.580
They're obviously robbery cases. 

39:48.580 --> 39:51.650
But they're all left as unsolved cases. 

39:51.990 --> 39:54.690
January 15, 2005. 

39:57.590 --> 39:59.990
October 9, 2010. 

40:03.620 --> 40:05.200
That's strange. 

40:06.160 --> 40:07.280
What is? 

40:07.280 --> 40:09.890
January 15, 2005. 

40:09.890 --> 40:12.690
October 9, 2010? 

40:13.220 --> 40:14.480
What about that? 

40:14.480 --> 40:15.860
Wait a moment. 

40:35.630 --> 40:39.130
[Occupation and Project Activity] 

41:03.040 --> 41:04.950
Where is the person who used to live here? 

41:04.950 --> 41:06.480
Oh, the bachelor? 

41:06.480 --> 41:09.070
He went on a business trip to China on Friday. 

41:09.070 --> 41:11.070
What's the problem? 

41:12.530 --> 41:13.960
Director Yeo. 

41:15.370 --> 41:17.160
These paintings 

41:17.160 --> 41:19.760
are similar to the one at Sun Hwa's house. 

41:29.810 --> 41:30.440
Yes. 

41:30.440 --> 41:31.650
<i>Director Yeo. </i>

41:32.300 --> 41:34.050
<i>You're going to have to head over right now. </i>

41:34.960 --> 41:37.660
Two men died on Friday night. 

41:37.660 --> 41:41.030
One at the Yang Pyeong villa.
The other at the jewel shop. 

41:41.940 --> 41:46.440
These are the killed people who had a relation to Sun Hwa Yang. 

41:46.440 --> 41:50.610
These are the people who were killed because of money. 

41:51.820 --> 41:53.420
But the thing is... 

41:53.420 --> 41:54.960
The interesting thing is... 

41:54.960 --> 41:59.870
This is not the first for two different murder cases that occurred on the same day. 

42:00.990 --> 42:02.660
What is this? 

42:02.660 --> 42:05.600
So, does this mean that all three times, one suspect killed both 

42:05.600 --> 42:09.270
people who had a relation to Sung Ah Yang and a money contract? 

42:09.270 --> 42:11.690
In the villa case, 

42:11.690 --> 42:14.050
there was a reason for the suspect's crime location. 

42:14.050 --> 42:18.460
The suspect, who injected drugs into Jae Min's ankle at the garage 

42:18.460 --> 42:23.040
drove Jae Min's car, went to a 2nd floor cafe, 

42:23.040 --> 42:24.560
and waited for the right time. 

42:25.770 --> 42:30.250
He aimed for the time Kil Soo Kim got ready to close up, 

42:30.250 --> 42:32.840
to carry out his armed robbery. 

42:33.640 --> 42:39.200
Kil Soo Kim's murderer hid and waited in the camera's blind spot. 

42:39.200 --> 42:41.660
And at the time the movie ended, 

42:41.660 --> 42:44.540
he hid between the exiting people 

42:44.540 --> 42:46.350
and escaped. 

42:46.350 --> 42:50.120
Hidden among those people,
he rode Jae Min's car 

42:50.120 --> 42:51.890
and headed to the villa. 

42:51.890 --> 42:54.230
And that's where he committed his second murder. 

42:55.240 --> 42:57.120
But why's that? 

42:57.120 --> 42:59.090
I can understand the murder about the money contracts, 

42:59.090 --> 43:02.090
but why kill the people around Sung Ah Yang? 

43:07.910 --> 43:10.220
Age: 31
Sung Gyu Do 

43:10.220 --> 43:12.750
Korean-Chinese 

43:12.750 --> 43:15.440
He arrived February 2004 on a student visa, 

43:15.440 --> 43:17.680
and is now in the process of getting legal papers ready 

43:17.680 --> 43:20.190
but we can't seem to check the paperwork. 

43:20.190 --> 43:22.620
January 2005.
October 2010. 

43:22.620 --> 43:25.270
There's records he left for China on the days of the murder. 

43:25.270 --> 43:27.560
Maybe the guy with the passport 

43:28.540 --> 43:30.360
was his alibi. 

43:32.040 --> 43:35.330
These guys are considered to be in a special organization. 

43:35.330 --> 43:37.680
As soon as the alibi is confirmed, 

43:37.680 --> 43:39.680
he carries out the work in a bulk. 

43:41.300 --> 43:42.530
This bastard. 

43:43.670 --> 43:45.920
He's stuck here somewhere. 

43:45.920 --> 43:47.720
Although we'll have to look into it more, 

43:47.720 --> 43:50.330
I think the two have a personal relationship. 

43:50.330 --> 43:53.690
If he eliminated only the people Sun Hwa hated, 

43:54.790 --> 43:57.340
would that be a murder accomplice? 

44:27.670 --> 44:30.590
You don't seem interested in your alibi confirmation. 

44:30.590 --> 44:35.400
Because it doesn't matter whatever the truth is. 

44:35.400 --> 44:39.000
You, yourself, could've hoped to be the murder suspect. 

44:39.000 --> 44:40.500
Why would I? 

44:44.070 --> 44:45.540
Who is that man? 

44:45.540 --> 44:48.970
The one who always kills the people you detest? 

44:48.970 --> 44:50.660
Who is he? 

44:52.110 --> 44:53.410
Who is it? 

44:53.410 --> 44:54.700
That man. 

44:57.230 --> 44:58.880
You don't know? 

44:58.880 --> 45:00.840
I was curious for a long time 

45:01.490 --> 45:04.690
about the death of the people I hated. 

45:06.420 --> 45:08.260
I only thought it was really strange. 

45:10.530 --> 45:11.720
But, 

45:12.980 --> 45:15.200
you say it's one man who killed them? 

45:22.210 --> 45:23.700
You recognize this painting, right? 

45:30.400 --> 45:32.150
This painting. 

45:50.840 --> 45:52.570
Do you like the paintings? 

45:53.470 --> 45:54.510
Yes. 

45:55.440 --> 45:57.020
Should we get one done too? 

45:57.600 --> 45:59.020
Yes. 

46:07.510 --> 46:11.120
A painter that traps the soul, Modigliani. 

46:11.120 --> 46:15.530
Feeling he was cursed, he called himself 'Modi'. 

46:15.530 --> 46:18.690
Until he understood the depths of the soul, 

46:18.690 --> 46:21.750
he couldn't draw the eyes of the person. 

46:21.750 --> 46:24.460
The one person whose eyes he painted was 
his wife Jeanne. 

46:24.460 --> 46:26.490
Although others couldn't understand, 

46:27.720 --> 46:32.150
the one person who understood him was 

46:33.090 --> 46:34.660
Jeanne. 

46:42.450 --> 46:43.980
Sun Hwa Yang is 

46:45.340 --> 46:47.350
Sung Gyu Do's 'Jeanne'? 

46:50.530 --> 46:51.850
Yes? 

46:54.140 --> 46:55.620
Detective Baek? 

46:56.760 --> 46:59.070
Excuse me, but who is this? 

47:01.260 --> 47:02.750
He says he's 'Half Moon'. 

47:05.990 --> 47:06.920
Hey. 

47:06.920 --> 47:08.310
How'd you get this number? 

47:08.310 --> 47:10.820
Do Shik, that's not the problem. 

47:11.330 --> 47:14.620
You have to protect me, okay? 

47:14.620 --> 47:15.700
What is it? 

47:15.700 --> 47:18.150
<i>The broker related to the Errands Center </i>

47:18.150 --> 47:20.130
cleaned his tracks and is under the radar. 

47:20.130 --> 47:22.450
In order to erase the hitman's tracks, 

47:22.450 --> 47:25.040
there are ten guys going around with knives in that area. 

47:25.040 --> 47:26.190
That area? 

47:27.400 --> 47:28.890
Which neighborhood is that area? 

47:28.890 --> 47:31.860
I think something's going to happen at Incheon Port. 

47:31.860 --> 47:33.480
Okay. Keep looking into it. 

47:34.360 --> 47:35.480
You. 

47:35.480 --> 47:38.230
Y-you can never call my phone. 

47:41.860 --> 47:43.850
From when do you think it was? 

47:43.850 --> 47:45.850
This guy is dangerous. 

47:47.190 --> 47:49.840
There are over ten guys running around to erase his tracks. 

47:50.840 --> 47:53.410
He said they were probably going to the Incheon Port. 

47:53.410 --> 47:56.050
In conclusion, one person is the suspect. 

47:57.520 --> 47:59.420
These two cases are so different. 

47:59.420 --> 48:01.590
One is because of money. 

48:01.590 --> 48:03.190
What is the other? 

48:04.740 --> 48:05.870
Is it love? 

48:09.130 --> 48:11.190
We'll have to make him come to us. 

48:13.710 --> 48:15.420
Why would he do that? 

48:17.460 --> 48:18.900
Why me? 

48:20.110 --> 48:22.540
Even to you, it doesn't make sense. Does it? 

48:24.160 --> 48:26.410
You guys find that man! 

48:28.270 --> 48:29.780
Find him and bring him. 

48:30.970 --> 48:33.240
Bring him in front of me! 

48:34.620 --> 48:37.650
He was around you for too long. 

48:39.290 --> 48:42.990
And he murdered the people you hate for nothing in return. 

48:44.220 --> 48:47.970
That man has nowhere to go. 

48:47.970 --> 48:49.970
He's definitely going to show up again. 

49:05.720 --> 49:09.260
We have to find him before the others get him. 

49:09.260 --> 49:10.990
He'll show up. 

49:10.990 --> 49:11.940
What if he doesn't? 

49:11.940 --> 49:13.930
He will. 

49:13.930 --> 49:16.050
To him, this lady is everything. 

49:16.050 --> 49:18.780
He's contemplating this far beyond what we can imagine. 

49:20.160 --> 49:22.020
Director Yeo, does this make sense? 

49:22.020 --> 49:24.250
He drew a picture for her because he fell in love at first sight? 

49:24.250 --> 49:26.620
Okay. Let's say he can because he's in love. 

49:26.620 --> 49:30.220
But killing others when he wasn't even asked to do so. 

49:31.950 --> 49:33.890
How do you trust that kind of guy? 

49:33.890 --> 49:34.970
It's time. 

49:42.240 --> 49:44.570
Damn it. 

50:21.680 --> 50:23.840
It's almost time. 

50:30.430 --> 50:31.580
Yes? 

50:36.470 --> 50:37.910
What did you say? 

50:39.080 --> 50:40.250
Director Yeo. 

50:41.180 --> 50:42.840
Sung Gyu Do is dead. 

50:46.060 --> 50:47.470
But... 

50:47.470 --> 50:50.130
He died falling out of the boat pulling into Incheon Port. 

50:50.130 --> 50:51.540
The boat departed from Bern, 

50:51.540 --> 50:54.350
and at 6:46 pm, a person fell out of the boat and died. 

50:54.350 --> 50:56.190
They couldn't retrieve the body. 

50:56.190 --> 50:59.490
A boat coming in? Not leaving? 

50:59.490 --> 51:01.810
Yes. Boat coming in. 

51:05.050 --> 51:06.520
That's an alibi. 

51:07.640 --> 51:10.840
They're making an alibi by faking his death. 

51:12.190 --> 51:13.290
Then, 

51:13.290 --> 51:15.800
if the alibi is dead, the next is... 

51:16.640 --> 51:21.590
Where are you all looking? 

51:26.870 --> 51:28.340
No. 

51:30.910 --> 51:34.570
Since he's the painter,
he's avoiding their gazes. 

51:36.080 --> 51:38.050
He can't make eye contact. 

51:40.860 --> 51:42.570
Is it fear? 

51:55.860 --> 51:58.330
His awful self-complexion. 

52:04.830 --> 52:06.240
Insomnia. 

52:17.090 --> 52:19.710
When I thought I had to protect you, 

52:20.490 --> 52:23.650
I at least had the hope of happiness. 

52:24.360 --> 52:26.390
I was able to do anything. 

52:29.140 --> 52:31.340
No matter what,
I was able to endure. 

52:35.240 --> 52:37.330
Now, I don't have anything. 

53:37.490 --> 53:39.040
and 

53:40.130 --> 53:41.720
nervousness. 

54:07.480 --> 54:08.450
Yeah. 

54:08.450 --> 54:11.310
Director Yeo, Sung Hwa is going somewhere. 

54:11.310 --> 54:12.280
What? 

54:13.100 --> 54:14.920
Don't lose her. 

54:14.920 --> 54:16.080
Let's go. 

54:16.080 --> 54:18.380
Yes, sir. But where to? 

54:18.380 --> 54:20.510
Just hurry up and go already. 

57:27.480 --> 57:29.000
What is this place? 

57:30.100 --> 57:31.500
Let's take a look. 

01:00:06.580 --> 01:00:09.090
Why did Sung Gyu Do go to that place? 

01:00:10.380 --> 01:00:13.950
And how did you know to go there? 

01:00:15.920 --> 01:00:18.170
I was looking at my daughter's picture 

01:00:18.930 --> 01:00:20.570
and remembered. 

01:00:21.220 --> 01:00:23.990
The day Hye Jin was really sick 

01:00:24.680 --> 01:00:25.990
that night 

01:00:27.420 --> 01:00:29.630
I pounded on the door of the closed pharmacy 

01:00:31.440 --> 01:00:33.480
and was barely able to buy medicine. 

01:00:33.480 --> 01:00:34.820
That night. 

01:00:37.500 --> 01:00:39.940
That's where I first met him. 

01:00:52.050 --> 01:00:53.800
Tonight, for the first time 

01:00:56.810 --> 01:00:59.040
I held a knife against somebody. 

01:01:02.620 --> 01:01:04.160
Now, I 

01:01:06.650 --> 01:01:09.610
don't have anywhere to go. 

01:01:17.330 --> 01:01:19.190
Please get over with it quickly. 

01:01:20.980 --> 01:01:23.020
My child is sick. 

01:02:33.070 --> 01:02:34.500
Thank you. 

01:03:03.360 --> 01:03:05.630
The cursed painter Modi 

01:03:07.320 --> 01:03:09.510
painted the eyes of one person. 

01:03:11.900 --> 01:03:14.840
That was his wife Jeanne. 

01:03:16.270 --> 01:03:20.380
The only person who understood his journey 

01:03:21.240 --> 01:03:23.020
was Jeanne. 

01:03:25.140 --> 01:03:28.750
This was the painting Sung Gyu held onto when he died. 

01:03:33.870 --> 01:03:37.530
Because of the one phrase you said in the midst of his cursed life 

01:03:37.530 --> 01:03:41.120
you became his 'Jeanne'. 

01:03:41.120 --> 01:03:44.030
Watching you in pain, 

01:03:44.030 --> 01:03:47.000
he also was in pain with you. 

01:03:47.000 --> 01:03:49.050
In order for him to live, 

01:03:49.050 --> 01:03:53.050
I think he had to make sure you were happy. 

01:03:57.050 --> 01:03:58.440
Did he 

01:04:00.660 --> 01:04:03.280
say anything? 

01:04:15.430 --> 01:04:18.700
I don't know why she said that, but 

01:04:20.750 --> 01:04:24.040
from my trashed life 

01:04:24.040 --> 01:04:27.240
those were the first and last words I heard. 

01:04:28.100 --> 01:04:29.980
'Thank you.' 

01:04:31.780 --> 01:04:34.540
I wanted to protect, until the end, 

01:04:35.260 --> 01:04:36.770
your happiness. 

01:05:11.890 --> 01:05:13.030
I'm sorry. 

01:05:15.860 --> 01:05:17.200
Now, 

01:05:19.890 --> 01:05:21.880
I might not be able to protect you anymore. 

01:05:27.070 --> 01:05:28.340
As you tried to protect me, 

01:05:31.190 --> 01:05:33.770
when people left my life one by one, 

01:05:33.770 --> 01:05:36.120
I became more miserable. 

01:05:37.060 --> 01:05:38.660
And now, 

01:05:38.660 --> 01:05:41.680
I don't even have hope to dream for happiness! 

01:05:42.590 --> 01:05:44.230
How can you...  

01:05:46.720 --> 01:05:49.440
How can you think like that! 

01:06:17.770 --> 01:06:20.780
I told him I never wished for those people to die. 

01:06:22.920 --> 01:06:25.440
That I became more and more miserable. 

01:06:28.100 --> 01:06:29.790
That it was 

01:06:31.540 --> 01:06:33.340
all because of him. 

01:06:38.870 --> 01:06:41.120
He was probably the person she hated most. 

01:06:44.190 --> 01:06:46.890
If even he died,
she probably wouldn't be happy. 

01:07:01.430 --> 01:07:03.440
You killed a person. 

01:07:06.610 --> 01:07:09.340
I have two younger sisters at home. 

01:07:09.340 --> 01:07:11.570
They just left me and ran away. 

01:07:11.570 --> 01:07:14.900
They said I just needed to push him. 

01:07:14.900 --> 01:07:17.530
They told me to get off the boat and go there again. 

01:07:21.120 --> 01:07:23.290
Here. This is all. 

01:07:38.140 --> 01:07:39.780
Where did he go? 

01:08:03.720 --> 01:08:05.410
She said she had a rough job. 

01:08:07.630 --> 01:08:08.990
Isn't she cute? 

01:08:08.990 --> 01:08:11.830
Yeah, she is. 

01:08:12.370 --> 01:08:15.830
Don't you want to take her home? 

01:08:18.490 --> 01:08:20.689
I want to take her home right now. 

01:08:21.279 --> 01:08:23.140
Really? 

01:08:23.140 --> 01:08:24.649
Mom! 

01:08:24.649 --> 01:08:27.479
There's a man who said he'd take the dog. 

01:08:30.180 --> 01:08:32.720
[Selling Abandoned Dog] 

01:08:43.609 --> 01:08:46.850
I also really like dogs. 

01:08:48.189 --> 01:08:51.240
But I just don't have the confidence to take care of one. 

01:08:55.250 --> 01:08:56.890
Come here. 

01:09:03.050 --> 01:09:06.750
It's not taking care of one.
It's living together with one. 

01:09:11.310 --> 01:09:14.399
Human beings are really strange. 

01:09:14.399 --> 01:09:16.399
They leave simple happiness 

01:09:16.399 --> 01:09:18.399
and keep searching for difficult sadness. 

01:09:19.120 --> 01:09:20.430
Huh? 

01:09:21.689 --> 01:09:23.529
Do you have a daughter? 

01:09:23.529 --> 01:09:24.609
Yes. 

01:09:30.700 --> 01:09:31.850
I see. 

01:09:45.970 --> 01:09:50.920
Subtitles by CJ Entertainment 

01:09:50.920 --> 01:09:54.660
Only the bone was left at the lower area with the rupture. 

01:09:54.660 --> 01:09:58.470
I thought turning into a skeleton in 3 months was interesting. 

01:09:58.470 --> 01:10:00.470
He published a chemistry book? 

01:10:00.470 --> 01:10:02.810
Korea University,
chemical engineering? 

01:10:02.810 --> 01:10:04.460
The culprit of Soo Jung Lee's murder is... 

01:10:04.460 --> 01:10:05.520
They're all girls. 

01:10:05.520 --> 01:10:08.420
They kill one and dispose the other. 

01:10:08.420 --> 01:10:10.210
What are you talking about? 

01:10:10.210 --> 01:10:12.980
I told you I went for a drive. 

01:10:12.980 --> 01:10:15.460
I'm not really sure. 

01:10:15.460 --> 01:10:17.020
That girl. 

01:10:17.020 --> 01:10:18.690
Girl? 

01:10:18.690 --> 01:10:21.580
Professor.
You believe me too, right? 

01:10:21.580 --> 01:10:26.400
Well, everyone's getting curious about what's inside there.
