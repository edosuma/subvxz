04:57.763 --> 04:59.063
Sanchez.

05:01.034 --> 05:03.801
- What's this kid's name again?

08:23.168 --> 08:24.235
Hello.

08:24.237 --> 08:25.970
<i> Jacob?</i>

08:25.972 --> 08:27.271
Who's this?

08:27.273 --> 08:29.473
<i> Sweetie, it's me.</i>

08:30.876 --> 08:32.409
Mom?

08:38.316 --> 08:40.417
You don't sound too good.

08:41.253 --> 08:43.187
<i> I'm okay, baby.</i>

08:45.190 --> 08:46.557
<i> I'm just tired.</i>

08:48.594 --> 08:50.127
Yeah.

08:51.196 --> 08:54.064
Hang in there, you'll be okay.

08:56.401 --> 08:58.669
<i> Has your brother
been by lately?</i>

08:58.671 --> 08:59.970
<i>-No.
-But I... I thought...</i>

08:59.972 --> 09:02.773
<i>-I don't want him
coming over here. No.
-I just...</i>

09:02.775 --> 09:04.275
No.

09:05.744 --> 09:07.778
Ma, I gotta go to work.

09:10.882 --> 09:12.316
<i> Okay.</i>

09:16.254 --> 09:18.789
Ma, I'll come visit you
real soon.

09:19.357 --> 09:20.791
<i> Jacob.</i>

09:21.927 --> 09:22.993
Yeah.

09:22.995 --> 09:27.531
<i> I want you to know
how proud I am of you.</i>

09:27.599 --> 09:30.367
<i> For everything you've done.</i>

09:31.503 --> 09:33.404
Get some sleep now.

09:33.805 --> 09:36.106
<i> I love you, sweetie.</i>

09:37.576 --> 09:39.843
<i> I love you so much.</i>

12:00.785 --> 12:03.654
<i> Everything
all right, Jacob?</i>

12:03.722 --> 12:06.790
Everything's going
okay by you?

12:11.596 --> 12:14.231
You sure about that, son?

12:15.333 --> 12:17.000
Yes, sir.

12:18.103 --> 12:20.204
I'm late heading home.

12:20.338 --> 12:24.041
If you need anything,
you let me know, all right?

12:25.610 --> 12:28.345
Take care of yourself, son.

12:42.060 --> 12:44.762
<i> Well, Wednesday night
is my only night off, Frank.</i>

12:44.764 --> 12:48.532
<i> I can't give you
another night off, Nicks.</i>

12:49.634 --> 12:51.001
I don't want
another night off.

12:51.003 --> 12:52.703
It's just that,
every day is the same.

12:52.705 --> 12:56.974
I like it that way,
but Wednesday nights
I gotta kinda reset.

12:56.976 --> 12:59.810
And it throws me off
a little bit.

13:02.347 --> 13:03.480
All right.

13:03.482 --> 13:05.716
I'm gonna give you
Wednesday nights.

13:05.718 --> 13:08.452
I'll move Tito
to the day shift.

13:10.188 --> 13:12.489
Thanks, Frank,
I appreciate it.

13:13.758 --> 13:16.460
You think I give a fuck
about you?

13:18.296 --> 13:20.798
I don't give a shit about you.

13:20.932 --> 13:23.167
You're making my life easier.

13:23.401 --> 13:24.001
Tito falls asleep

13:24.003 --> 13:26.804
halfway through
the fucking picture anyway.

13:26.806 --> 13:28.705
At least with you,

13:28.840 --> 13:31.408
I don't got to
worry about that.

13:32.477 --> 13:34.945
You don't fucking sleep.

15:32.363 --> 15:34.598
Do I know you from somewhere?

15:35.533 --> 15:37.434
Uh, um, no.

15:37.702 --> 15:39.469
Am I confusing you
for someone else?

15:39.471 --> 15:41.438
Do you know a guy named Pete?

15:41.440 --> 15:42.372
Pete? No.

15:42.374 --> 15:44.274
You mind if I sit down?

15:49.914 --> 15:52.683
Did you know that
marijuana was the most
commonly used

15:52.685 --> 15:54.318
illegal drug
in the United States?

15:54.320 --> 15:56.153
That a hundred million
Americans have tried it
at least once?

15:56.155 --> 16:01.692
And, uh, twenty-five million
have smoked it within
the last year?

16:03.661 --> 16:05.295
I get it.

16:06.864 --> 16:08.065
What?

16:08.067 --> 16:10.200
Why you came over here.
I get it.

16:10.202 --> 16:12.669
You get what?

16:12.671 --> 16:14.237
You're, um...

16:14.305 --> 16:16.273
You're a salesman.

16:16.275 --> 16:18.208
Oh, no, no. No.

16:18.943 --> 16:20.377
No, it's okay.

16:20.379 --> 16:22.879
Look I...
That's not the reason
why I came over here.

16:22.881 --> 16:23.847
I really did think that, like,

16:23.849 --> 16:28.552
uh, that I'd seen you
somewhere before,
but I guess not.

16:30.021 --> 16:32.322
Anyway, if you're looking
for a good time...

16:32.324 --> 16:33.056
You know, I can...

16:33.058 --> 16:35.325
You know I can
get you anything.

16:35.327 --> 16:37.394
Anything you need.

16:40.331 --> 16:41.932
I'll keep that in mind, uh...

16:41.934 --> 16:45.469
Oh, my name is,
my name is Marlon.

16:45.570 --> 16:46.970
Jacob.

16:48.272 --> 16:51.608
But, uh,
everyone calls me Nicks.

16:51.610 --> 16:53.910
It's a pleasure
to meet you, Nicks.

17:00.985 --> 17:03.220
Can I get you a cup of coffee
or something?

17:03.222 --> 17:04.988
Oh, no.
Don't get me wrong, I would...

17:04.990 --> 17:07.624
I would love to have
a cup of coffee but I...

17:07.626 --> 17:10.160
I don't think
that's a good idea.

17:11.262 --> 17:12.194
Why not?

17:12.196 --> 17:15.398
With, um, the people here...
They don't...

17:15.700 --> 17:18.635
They don't really
like me that much.

17:18.637 --> 17:20.470
What do you mean
they don't like you?

17:20.472 --> 17:23.540
Just forget it, man.

17:28.913 --> 17:31.114
You know I'm afraid to ask
myself this question,

17:31.116 --> 17:33.483
but I ask myself
this question sometimes.

17:33.485 --> 17:36.353
You know, like,
if I owned this place,

17:36.355 --> 17:39.756
would I want
a person like me
to be in here?

17:40.191 --> 17:41.725
I mean, look at me, man.

17:41.727 --> 17:42.893
You know.

17:42.895 --> 17:43.960
You know.

17:43.962 --> 17:47.831
The way I comb my hair
and the stylish
clothes I wear.

17:47.833 --> 17:49.666
It is like...

17:49.668 --> 17:53.403
I mean, can you
blame them, really?
I mean...

17:54.238 --> 17:55.739
You know?

17:59.844 --> 18:02.512
Not everybody's like them.

18:04.215 --> 18:05.649
Not me.

18:13.357 --> 18:17.961
You know, there's some
good left in the world
if you look for it.

18:19.464 --> 18:22.065
I'm gonna end this thing
right now.

18:29.507 --> 18:32.642
Is there anything
I can get for you, sir?

18:34.912 --> 18:36.046
Yeah, there is actually.

18:36.048 --> 18:38.949
I need a cup of coffee
for my friend.

18:40.084 --> 18:41.852
Your friend?

18:42.453 --> 18:42.886
Yeah, my friend.

18:42.888 --> 18:46.523
He's my friend.
What's so hard to believe
about that?

18:46.624 --> 18:47.991
He's a nice guy.

18:47.993 --> 18:52.395
Is there a problem
with him sitting and having
a cup of coffee with me?

18:53.197 --> 18:55.365
Well, of course not, sir.

19:20.758 --> 19:23.927
Got you that goddamn coffee,
didn't we?

19:27.131 --> 19:28.965
Sugar tits.

19:40.444 --> 19:45.048
Marlon, I think you're
the most interesting person
I've ever met.

19:46.617 --> 19:48.585
Shit, I got to go.

19:48.587 --> 19:49.419
Yeah?

19:49.421 --> 19:52.022
Yeah, um, they have, uh,

19:52.890 --> 19:53.323
the shelter.

19:53.325 --> 19:56.660
It serves food at 6:00 a.m.
and when food is gone,
it's gone, so...

19:56.662 --> 19:59.963
I can get you
something to eat here.

19:59.965 --> 20:01.464
Oh, no, I couldn't.

20:01.466 --> 20:03.700
You've done enough for me.

20:04.435 --> 20:06.203
Really, I insist.

20:06.205 --> 20:08.505
Oh, maybe some other time,
you know?

20:08.507 --> 20:10.774
If you want to buy me dinner,
Thursday would be great.

20:10.776 --> 20:13.743
Um, they have
a great strip special.

20:13.745 --> 20:15.579
Whatever you want.

20:15.581 --> 20:18.148
All right, I'm gonna
hold you to that.

20:18.150 --> 20:19.783
I hope you do.

20:21.719 --> 20:23.787
It was a pleasure, Nicks.

20:23.789 --> 20:25.422
Likewise.

20:25.623 --> 20:27.924
All right,
I'll see you around.

20:30.494 --> 20:32.429
Thanks for the coffee.

20:32.431 --> 20:34.564
Yeah, sure thing.

20:46.677 --> 20:49.045
Can I get my check, please?

21:13.471 --> 21:16.072
Wait one second,
I'll be right back.

21:20.444 --> 21:21.411
Um...

21:21.413 --> 21:23.913
Oh, you're early.

21:26.384 --> 21:28.418
Oh, all right. I'll, um...

21:28.420 --> 21:32.389
I'll get him out of here.
Wait around the corner.

21:46.070 --> 21:49.005
All right,
I'll see you tomorrow, Vinnie.

22:05.756 --> 22:07.457
Well, come on.

22:45.963 --> 22:50.300
I was thinking maybe
you could come over
to my place next week.

22:50.801 --> 22:54.938
You know,
I always charge
more for outcalls.

22:55.439 --> 22:58.007
I mean, for dinner,
or something.

22:59.643 --> 23:03.146
You know,
it doesn't always
have to be about this.

23:06.083 --> 23:09.652
It doesn't always
have to be about what?

23:12.089 --> 23:13.490
Sex.

23:28.139 --> 23:31.007
Just sayin',
it doesn't have to be.

23:59.503 --> 24:02.105
I don't think
it's going to happen.

24:02.107 --> 24:04.107
I'm just not interested

24:04.109 --> 24:08.611
in getting involved with
any of my clients like that.

24:10.381 --> 24:14.417
I'd like to think
I was more than
one of your clients.

24:25.229 --> 24:26.563
All right.

24:26.565 --> 24:28.865
I'll come over next week.

24:30.167 --> 24:32.435
And we'll see where it goes.

24:32.437 --> 24:33.770
Okay?

24:44.281 --> 24:46.683
I'll see you next week.

24:59.997 --> 25:02.198
Hey, Sully, how are you?

25:02.600 --> 25:04.667
How am I?

25:04.869 --> 25:07.003
Terrible. That's how I am.

25:08.939 --> 25:10.607
Seventy years old,
three kids,

25:10.609 --> 25:15.578
and not one of them
had the decency to call
their old man on his birthday.

25:15.580 --> 25:17.614
Can you believe that shit?

25:18.148 --> 25:20.383
It was yesterday, right?

25:20.385 --> 25:22.085
-What was that?
-Yesterday.

25:22.087 --> 25:24.354
Yeah, yesterday, yesterday.

25:26.957 --> 25:30.326
I'm the reason
those little fuckers
are alive.

25:30.728 --> 25:32.395
And they had the nerve

25:32.397 --> 25:35.632
not to call me
on my 70th birthday.

25:36.300 --> 25:38.601
Yeah, I'm sorry to hear that.

25:39.136 --> 25:43.473
I bet you call
your father every year
on his birthday, huh?

25:46.277 --> 25:48.511
You're a good kid, Nicks.

25:49.480 --> 25:51.214
So, what is it?

25:53.183 --> 25:54.884
16 millimeter, right?

25:54.886 --> 25:57.220
-Yeah, 16.
-Let me see where it is.

25:57.222 --> 25:59.455
I got it here somewhere.

26:04.194 --> 26:05.862
Here you go.

26:08.532 --> 26:11.367
Ah, no, no, no, no,
you get me next time.

26:12.436 --> 26:14.304
My register's broken.

26:14.772 --> 26:16.739
You're a good friend.

26:16.974 --> 26:18.408
Hey,

26:18.475 --> 26:20.743
beautiful footage, by the way.

26:21.345 --> 26:23.513
-Thanks, Sully.
-Mmm-hmm.

26:25.282 --> 26:30.086
So Nicks, tell me,
how's that girl of yours?

26:31.622 --> 26:33.056
Ivana?

26:34.358 --> 26:35.625
She's great.

26:35.627 --> 26:38.895
I was just over at
her place before.

26:40.297 --> 26:42.365
You havin' fun, huh?

26:42.766 --> 26:45.702
Ooh, I'd love to hear
all the juicy details.

26:45.704 --> 26:49.205
But I don't want you
thinking I'm a dirty old man,
you know?

26:52.509 --> 26:55.011
You're a lucky guy, Nicks.

26:55.013 --> 26:56.746
You hold onto her.

26:56.748 --> 26:59.182
Don't let her get away,
you know?

26:59.883 --> 27:02.719
Not everybody's so fortunate.

27:04.054 --> 27:05.488
I will.

27:10.828 --> 27:12.962
You got something for me?

27:15.733 --> 27:18.568
Can I have that one
ready by tomorrow?

27:18.836 --> 27:21.204
Sure, you got it, kid.

27:22.539 --> 27:23.673
Thanks, Sully.

27:23.675 --> 27:25.975
You be safe out there, huh?

28:36.647 --> 28:39.749
<i> So, tell me
what happened to you.</i>

28:42.986 --> 28:46.756
Nicks, what happened to you?

28:46.758 --> 28:49.358
I don't want to talk about it.

28:49.893 --> 28:54.464
-Just tell me...
-I don't want
to talk about it.

29:37.574 --> 29:39.742
We were ambushed.

29:44.648 --> 29:45.915
Coming from all sides.

29:45.917 --> 29:48.918
It seemed like
it lasted hours.

29:48.920 --> 29:50.920
Probably only a minute.

29:59.029 --> 30:01.664
They started coming down
toward us.

30:02.099 --> 30:03.866
I was laying next to
a good buddy of mine.

30:03.868 --> 30:06.969
I'd been with him
since basic.

30:08.138 --> 30:10.606
I tried calling his name,

30:10.608 --> 30:13.409
he didn't respond.

30:15.279 --> 30:18.381
I turned him over,
he had...

30:18.982 --> 30:21.684
...a bullet in his neck.

30:24.788 --> 30:27.056
So much blood,

30:28.458 --> 30:31.494
was covering
his entire face.

30:34.965 --> 30:36.332
His...

30:36.800 --> 30:37.567
His eyes were open,

30:37.569 --> 30:40.670
he was staring straight back
into my eyes.

30:40.804 --> 30:42.805
And I'm staring at his,

30:44.675 --> 30:46.909
but he was already dead.

30:56.086 --> 30:58.955
There was only two of us left.

30:59.590 --> 31:01.324
Me and this kid.

31:01.758 --> 31:05.261
He was 18, maybe 19 years old.

31:07.064 --> 31:09.799
He was just a kid.

31:12.970 --> 31:15.037
They dragged us
to an old truck,

31:15.039 --> 31:16.005
threw us in the back,

31:16.007 --> 31:18.341
and drove us out
to a compound.

31:19.109 --> 31:20.743
Started questioning me,

31:20.745 --> 31:24.113
looking for a platoon
of Army Rangers

31:24.115 --> 31:26.582
hiding up in those mountains.

31:29.119 --> 31:30.386
I couldn't talk,

31:30.388 --> 31:31.821
I couldn't jeopardize

31:31.823 --> 31:35.157
30-something of them
to save two of us.

31:40.197 --> 31:43.499
When they realized
I wasn't gonna talk

31:44.067 --> 31:46.802
they started
working on this kid.

31:48.639 --> 31:50.373
And they started...

31:54.611 --> 31:58.414
Chopping him up
piece by piece.

32:07.257 --> 32:12.061
They told me I could stop it
if I spoke, but I couldn't.

32:13.997 --> 32:17.767
And he was...
He was screaming.

32:31.949 --> 32:34.083
And now I'm back.

32:41.258 --> 32:44.327
And not a day goes by
that I don't blame myself

32:44.329 --> 32:46.195
for that kid
not coming home.

33:56.299 --> 33:58.734
Can you believe
these cocksuckers?

33:58.736 --> 34:01.470
They trade four
prospect pitchers

34:01.472 --> 34:03.973
for one old washed-up,
wife-beatin' drunk

34:03.975 --> 34:06.776
who only one seven games
in Toronto last year.

34:06.778 --> 34:08.811
Can you believe that shit?

34:08.813 --> 34:13.349
They spend all that money
on that brand
new fancy stadium,

34:13.351 --> 34:15.518
now they expect us
to come out for that?

34:15.520 --> 34:19.054
Put some fucking winners
in the field,
then we'll come out.

34:22.926 --> 34:25.761
-16 millimeter, right? Yeah.
-Yeah, 16.

34:25.763 --> 34:27.830
Got it here somewhere.

34:28.665 --> 34:30.299
Here you go, son.

34:33.536 --> 34:35.438
Great stuff, by the way.

34:37.306 --> 34:38.774
What do you got?

34:43.179 --> 34:45.081
This one's kind of
personal, Sully.

34:45.083 --> 34:47.416
So, if you could,
you know...

34:47.418 --> 34:48.818
Let me guess.

34:48.820 --> 34:51.120
You and your
girlfriend, right?

34:52.688 --> 34:54.824
Yeah, something like that.

34:55.992 --> 34:57.827
Hey, no problem.

34:57.829 --> 34:58.928
Because if it's
delicate nature,

34:58.930 --> 35:02.031
I promise I won't go
sneaking any peeks.

35:02.033 --> 35:06.469
I got to make sure
the exposure is sufficient,
that's all.

35:16.346 --> 35:19.915
You know, you've been
leaving this place
a fucking mess every night?

35:19.917 --> 35:22.451
You better get
your shit together.

35:22.453 --> 35:23.219
All right.

35:23.221 --> 35:23.953
I don't want to
fucking hear it.

35:23.955 --> 35:26.155
I know it's you
leaving this place
a pigsty.

35:26.157 --> 35:30.059
Either get your act together,
or you get the fuck out.

35:30.861 --> 35:32.495
Yes, sir.

35:32.929 --> 35:34.997
Fucking kids today!

35:53.016 --> 35:56.485
Hey, man.
How's it hanging, brother?

35:57.554 --> 35:58.787
Hey.

35:59.990 --> 36:00.956
It's, um...

36:00.958 --> 36:04.727
-Marlon, right?
-Yeah, it's Marlon,
that's right.

36:05.795 --> 36:07.363
Have a seat.

36:18.508 --> 36:20.476
You want coffee?

36:20.478 --> 36:21.944
Sure.

36:43.967 --> 36:45.467
Thanks.

36:48.705 --> 36:49.939
What do you for a living?

36:49.941 --> 36:53.175
I mean,
if you don't mind me asking.

36:53.577 --> 36:56.745
I'm... I'm a projectionist.

36:58.014 --> 36:58.981
Did you know that
marijuana usage

36:58.983 --> 37:02.618
is a ritual part of
religious traditions
throughout the world?

37:02.620 --> 37:05.754
In Islamic countries,
it's accepted
alongside tobacco

37:05.756 --> 37:09.058
and coffee while alcohol
is strictly prohibited.

37:09.559 --> 37:13.028
That's the way it should be
all over the world.

37:13.030 --> 37:15.364
Weed ain't ever kill nobody.

37:17.767 --> 37:20.569
That's an interesting thought,
I guess.

37:31.648 --> 37:33.816
So, what are you looking at?

37:35.185 --> 37:36.685
Huh?

37:37.153 --> 37:39.688
That guy standing out here.

37:42.492 --> 37:45.861
Uh, I don't see anything, man.

37:46.129 --> 37:49.498
Standing out there looking
straight at us.

37:50.934 --> 37:53.535
Uh, sorry man, I don't...

37:54.104 --> 37:55.671
I don't see anything.

37:55.673 --> 37:58.774
You don't see him?
He's staring straight at us.

37:58.776 --> 38:00.609
Jeez! Chill man.

38:01.044 --> 38:03.078
I got bad eyes.

38:08.652 --> 38:11.887
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
I see him. I see him.

38:13.223 --> 38:14.857
You know him?

38:16.359 --> 38:17.393
No.

38:17.395 --> 38:18.994
Well, let's go talk to him.

38:18.996 --> 38:22.398
You know,
find out what he...
What he wants.

38:22.632 --> 38:24.166
Just forget it.

38:24.601 --> 38:25.901
Okay.

38:26.403 --> 38:29.171
Remember when I said
I can get you anything?

38:29.173 --> 38:31.874
You know,
I can get you anything.

38:32.976 --> 38:35.678
You want something?
I can...

38:42.786 --> 38:43.752
Are you taking off?

38:43.754 --> 38:46.322
There's some things
I just gotta do.

38:48.525 --> 38:50.392
I'll be seeing you.

38:53.663 --> 38:55.097
Sure.

39:14.017 --> 39:15.751
Hey, Sully.

39:18.521 --> 39:20.456
How you doing, son?

39:20.458 --> 39:21.690
All right.

39:21.692 --> 39:24.960
I was just
in the neighborhood.
I thought I'd stop by,

39:24.962 --> 39:26.628
see if I could get my film.

39:26.630 --> 39:28.130
Yeah, sure.

39:28.132 --> 39:30.466
I got it right here for you.

39:36.973 --> 39:38.941
Everything all right, Jacob?

39:42.645 --> 39:44.146
You sure?

39:44.914 --> 39:46.315
Yeah.

39:47.650 --> 39:49.084
Nicks,

39:50.186 --> 39:52.888
I know I only
develop your film.

39:53.490 --> 39:55.758
Who the fuck am I, right?

39:56.259 --> 39:59.395
But if you ever need
anybody to talk to,

39:59.397 --> 40:01.530
I'm here for you.

40:03.500 --> 40:05.567
What's going on, Sully?

40:05.869 --> 40:07.336
Nothing.

40:09.939 --> 40:11.340
Sully.

40:14.144 --> 40:17.012
I know you told me
not to look

40:17.313 --> 40:20.048
and I had
no intention, but, uh...

40:21.251 --> 40:22.684
I, uh...

40:22.852 --> 40:25.788
I caught a glimpse
of some of your film.

40:27.590 --> 40:28.490
I trusted you.

40:28.492 --> 40:32.194
I was simply checking
the exposure, that's all.

40:32.729 --> 40:34.696
I trusted you.

40:34.698 --> 40:38.867
I didn't intend
to look at it, man.

40:39.068 --> 40:41.069
It just happened.

40:41.071 --> 40:43.372
Sully, I trusted you.

40:45.042 --> 40:47.075
Nicks, I don't know
what to say.

40:47.077 --> 40:49.578
I mean,
I'm truly sorry, okay?

40:50.180 --> 40:52.414
I'm concerned
about you, kid.

40:58.455 --> 41:01.190
-How much do I owe you?
-Nothing.

41:01.192 --> 41:03.292
Don't fucking piss me off,
Sully.

41:03.294 --> 41:04.660
How much do I owe you?

41:04.662 --> 41:06.895
I don't want your money, kid.

41:11.901 --> 41:14.169
Nicks, you don't have to
do this, you know.

41:14.171 --> 41:16.605
It was a mistake,
I didn't mean to.

41:16.607 --> 41:20.042
-Nicks, Nicks,
please, huh?
-Fuck you.

41:20.543 --> 41:22.244
I'm sorry.

42:05.889 --> 42:09.124
<i> A 22 year old man,

-What?
-Wait.

43:20.296 --> 43:23.031
What the fuck is this?

It's nothing.

43:26.337 --> 43:27.803
It's nothing?

43:28.571 --> 43:31.306
You think I'm an idiot,
don't you?

43:33.209 --> 43:35.277
Oh, my God.

43:37.747 --> 43:42.884
The only reason I fucked you
is because
I felt sorry for you.

43:46.656 --> 43:48.223
You make me sick.

43:48.225 --> 43:50.158
You're so pathetic.

43:50.160 --> 43:51.326
Don't say that.

43:51.328 --> 43:54.062
I say whatever the fuck
I want to say.

43:54.064 --> 43:56.765
And you know the story
you told me?

43:57.000 --> 43:57.833
You were the weak one.

43:57.835 --> 44:03.839
You could have saved that kid,
but you didn't
so you could save yourself.

44:03.841 --> 44:05.307
Get out!

I thought we had something.

44:34.904 --> 44:37.239
I thought I was good for you.

44:39.809 --> 44:43.245
Anyway, call me back
when you get this.

44:47.950 --> 44:49.985
You know, I love you.

45:06.403 --> 45:09.638
Hey, Nicks,
how you doing, man?

45:18.648 --> 45:20.782
You don't look so good.

45:21.384 --> 45:23.351
You need some sleep.

45:29.258 --> 45:31.760
-You want one?
-Sure.

45:32.361 --> 45:34.529
One for him, too.

45:39.769 --> 45:42.337
Is that guy
still following you?

45:55.785 --> 45:59.921
You know how you always ask me
if there's anything I need?

46:00.490 --> 46:02.124
Like what?

46:04.861 --> 46:07.195
You know, you know.

46:08.264 --> 46:11.233
How do I know
you're not a snitch?

46:15.338 --> 46:17.906
I'm just
joking with you, man.

46:17.908 --> 46:19.808
Whatever you want.

46:22.745 --> 46:25.914
-What, what do you got?
-What do you want?

46:31.187 --> 46:34.022
I don't know,
something strong.

46:35.658 --> 46:37.592

want from me?

49:26.595 --> 49:28.363
Take this.

49:30.433 --> 49:32.067
What's this?

49:34.070 --> 49:35.670
Just take it.

49:39.208 --> 49:41.643
I don't even know who you are.

49:45.815 --> 49:48.283
You don't know who I am?

49:52.621 --> 49:55.056
I don't wanna know you.

Just take it.

50:01.163 --> 50:03.365
Stay away from me.

50:03.632 --> 50:05.867
Stay the fuck away from me.

50:06.769 --> 50:08.837
Stay away from me.

53:42.117 --> 53:44.752
What the fuck?

54:16.385 --> 54:18.753
Why won't you talk to me?
Why won't you
take my phone calls?

54:18.755 --> 54:21.823
-Leave me alone!
-Huh, why won't you
talk to me?

54:21.825 --> 54:23.024
Leave me alone, you freak!

54:23.026 --> 54:25.660

see you again!

<i> Just take it
out of my paycheck.</i>

54:44.748 --> 54:46.614
It's not about the money
I lost tonight.

54:46.616 --> 54:48.049
It's about the fact that
those customers

54:48.051 --> 54:50.818
will never come
to this theater again.

54:51.186 --> 54:54.622
I don't know
what happened, Frank.

54:54.990 --> 54:57.091
Something's going on with you.

54:57.159 --> 54:58.326
You're not right.

54:58.328 --> 55:00.662
Not that
you were ever right
to begin with.

55:00.664 --> 55:04.065
You look like shit,
you smell like shit,

55:04.067 --> 55:05.967

I'm sorry, Frank.

55:09.938 --> 55:11.606
Frank, I'm sorry.

55:11.608 --> 55:15.109
Clean the machine
and get the fuck out.

55:15.577 --> 55:18.646
You're sick in the head,
you know that?

55:18.881 --> 55:21.249
You need fucking help.

55:25.821 --> 55:28.756
Don't come back here
no more.

55:32.294 --> 55:34.062
I need more.

55:35.064 --> 55:36.931
No, no coffee.

I need more.

More what?

55:39.336 --> 55:42.904
More what...
What the fuck else would
I be talking about, man?

55:42.906 --> 55:44.572
Chill, man. Chill.

55:44.574 --> 55:46.874
I only...
I only got a little bit.

55:46.876 --> 55:48.443
Give me what you got.

55:48.445 --> 55:50.912
All right, all right.
Hold on a second.

55:50.914 --> 55:52.680
Give it.
Give it to me.

55:52.682 --> 55:55.083
You're making this shit
seem obvious, man.

55:55.085 --> 55:57.318
If you don't give me that
goddamn shit right now,

55:57.320 --> 56:02.123
I will slit
your fucking throat
and piss down your neck.

going on over there?</i>

01:00:47.143 --> 01:00:51.646
<i> I've been trying to call you
for the last three days.</i>

01:00:51.648 --> 01:00:54.248
I can't talk right now, Tom.

01:00:54.250 --> 01:00:56.917
<i> What the hell's
wrong with you?</i>

01:00:56.919 --> 01:00:59.220
<i> You sound like shit.</i>

01:01:00.689 --> 01:01:01.889
Yeah?

01:01:01.891 --> 01:01:04.625
<i> Yeah, seriously, Jacob.</i>

01:01:04.627 --> 01:01:08.596
<i> -What the fuck's your problem?
-What's my problem?</i>

01:01:09.598 --> 01:01:11.999
What's my problem, Tom?

01:01:12.534 --> 01:01:13.200
A lot of shit!

01:01:13.202 --> 01:01:16.070
That's what the fuck
my problem is!

01:01:16.072 --> 01:01:18.839
<i> Well, talk to me then.</i>

01:01:22.711 --> 01:01:24.311
<i> Jesus, how am I
supposed to know,</i>

01:01:24.313 --> 01:01:27.515
<i> if you don't
tell me anything?</i>

01:01:32.421 --> 01:01:35.322
<i>- It's you.
- It's me...</i>

01:01:35.324 --> 01:01:39.827
<i> -What's me?
-You following me, Tom?</i>

01:01:39.829 --> 01:01:41.495
<i> Following? Following you?</i>

01:01:41.497 --> 01:01:42.797
<i> What the fuck are you
talking about?</i>

01:01:42.799 --> 01:01:46.767
Are you following me?
Tom, you following me?

01:01:46.769 --> 01:01:48.536
You fucking following me?

01:01:48.538 --> 01:01:52.540
<i> All right, you know what,
I'm coming over.</i>

01:01:53.842 --> 01:01:55.843
I won't be here.

01:01:57.045 --> 01:01:57.945
<i> Ah, fuck it.</i>

01:01:57.947 --> 01:02:00.081
<i> I can't get through to you,
so I'm just gonna say it.</i>

01:02:00.083 --> 01:02:05.186
<i> Mom's dead, Jacob.
She died a couple days ago.</i>

01:02:13.361 --> 01:02:14.595
<i> Look, I didn't want to have to</i>

01:02:14.597 --> 01:02:15.563
<i> tell you like this,</i>

01:02:15.565 --> 01:02:16.831
<i> but I know how much you hate</i>

01:02:16.833 --> 01:02:19.700
<i> me coming over there, so...</i>

01:02:24.506 --> 01:02:26.574
<i> We all knew it was coming.</i>

01:02:26.576 --> 01:02:31.045
<i> I just wish she could have
seen you before she went.</i>

01:02:33.815 --> 01:02:35.816
<i> She's gone, man.</i>

01:02:37.185 --> 01:02:39.887
<i> She loved you, you know that?</i>

01:02:39.889 --> 01:02:43.758
<i> She was proud
of everything you've done.</i>

01:02:45.594 --> 01:02:47.762
<i> Look, I know
I haven't been much</i>

01:02:47.764 --> 01:02:50.264
<i> of a brother lately, but...</i>

01:02:50.632 --> 01:02:53.601
<i> But is there anything
I can do for you?</i>

01:02:53.802 --> 01:02:55.803
<i> Anything at all?</i>

01:03:09.484 --> 01:03:12.253
<i> Do you realize
the risk involved?</i>

01:03:12.255 --> 01:03:14.789
<i> You're asking for
classified material.</i>

01:03:15.624 --> 01:03:17.958
If anyone knew that
I had given you these,

01:03:17.960 --> 01:03:19.160
I wouldn't just lose my job.

01:03:19.162 --> 01:03:21.729
I'd face time in
federal prison.

01:03:23.031 --> 01:03:25.065
No one will know I have them.

01:03:26.101 --> 01:03:27.535
Yeah.

01:03:29.504 --> 01:03:33.107
Anyway, I wasn't worried
about getting caught.

01:03:33.308 --> 01:03:35.342
Put yourself in my shoes
for a minute.

01:03:35.344 --> 01:03:38.012
It takes you three days to
get your brother on the phone.

01:03:38.014 --> 01:03:41.649
Once you do, he sounds like
a fucking lunatic.

01:03:41.651 --> 01:03:43.717
Accusing you of shit.

01:03:43.719 --> 01:03:44.451
And then, to top it all off,

01:03:44.453 --> 01:03:46.754
he ask for interrogation reels
of serial killers...

01:03:46.756 --> 01:03:49.323
What the hell
am I supposed to think, huh?

01:03:49.325 --> 01:03:51.625
You asked if you could help.

01:03:51.627 --> 01:03:53.527
Yeah, I did.

01:03:57.799 --> 01:04:01.869
Well, just tell me
what you need them for then.

01:04:04.840 --> 01:04:06.473
Hmm?

01:04:08.643 --> 01:04:11.445
Jacob, come on.
What do you need them for?

01:04:11.447 --> 01:04:14.215
I'm just trying to
understand, Tom.

01:04:14.382 --> 01:04:17.318
-That's it.
-Mmm-hmm.

01:04:18.920 --> 01:04:20.855
Understand what?

01:04:24.327 --> 01:04:28.062
The world we live in,
it's such a sick place.

01:04:29.164 --> 01:04:32.733
I'm not commending it,
but I'm not gonna pretend
I don't see it.

01:04:32.735 --> 01:04:35.169
'Cause I see it everywhere.

01:04:35.171 --> 01:04:37.104
And I'm just trying
to understand.

01:04:37.106 --> 01:04:39.139
That's... That's it.

01:04:41.309 --> 01:04:43.577
I don't know, man.

01:04:52.087 --> 01:04:54.321
Okay. If I do this,

01:04:55.223 --> 01:04:56.290
I want you to promise me

01:04:56.292 --> 01:04:58.259
that you're going to
cut this shit out.

01:04:58.261 --> 01:05:00.728
All of it.
This... This isolation,

01:05:00.730 --> 01:05:03.697
this self-destructive
bullshit.

01:05:03.699 --> 01:05:06.333
You got to move forward,
Jacob.

01:05:06.335 --> 01:05:09.003
It's killing me here, man.

01:05:12.774 --> 01:05:17.578
Not a day goes by
where I don't wish it were me
who was sent over there.

01:05:18.213 --> 01:05:22.316
I'd give anything to see
things the way
they used to be.

01:05:22.318 --> 01:05:26.153
Please, Tom,
just get me those reels.

01:05:37.065 --> 01:05:38.799
Let me see what I can do.

01:06:22.210 --> 01:06:25.879
<i> Hey, Nicks,
how you doing, man?</i>

01:06:26.948 --> 01:06:28.349
Okay.

01:06:28.616 --> 01:06:29.416
Well, good.

01:06:29.418 --> 01:06:31.752
Maybe we can sit down,

01:06:31.754 --> 01:06:33.287
I can buy you a cup of coffee?

01:06:33.289 --> 01:06:35.723
No, Marlon,
let's not pretend
that our relationship

01:06:35.725 --> 01:06:38.759
is anything more than
what it is.

01:06:38.994 --> 01:06:40.761
What do you mean?

01:06:41.096 --> 01:06:41.996
What I mean?

01:06:41.998 --> 01:06:46.367
The only reason why I'm here
is because you got something
that I want.

01:06:46.369 --> 01:06:49.470
What's that,
a sense of humor?

01:06:50.105 --> 01:06:52.506
You're not cute, Marlon.

01:06:53.108 --> 01:06:54.641
You're not funny.

01:06:54.643 --> 01:06:59.246
What you are is a worthless,
homeless, piece of shit

01:06:59.248 --> 01:07:01.782
-pushing trash to kids.
-Watch it.

01:07:01.784 --> 01:07:03.984
I don't sell to no kids.

01:07:06.888 --> 01:07:09.156
Give me the shit.

01:07:14.396 --> 01:07:18.699
I want you to know,
because of you,
I'm hooked on this shit.

01:07:18.701 --> 01:07:19.733
I warned you, man.

01:07:19.735 --> 01:07:22.336
I told you it was addictive.

01:07:24.372 --> 01:07:25.239
You know what, Marlon?

01:07:25.241 --> 01:07:30.277
I'm gonna personally see to it
that you get exactly
what you deserve.

01:07:31.079 --> 01:07:35.315
Remember how I told you
there's some good left
in the world?

01:07:35.850 --> 01:07:37.785
You'll see.

01:08:12.554 --> 01:08:15.556
<i> I've always seen
optimism in life.</i>

01:08:16.291 --> 01:08:17.691
<i> The joy.</i>

01:08:19.560 --> 01:08:21.962
<i> I've always found beauty,</i>

01:08:22.497 --> 01:08:25.099
<i> until recently that is.</i>

01:08:26.835 --> 01:08:30.737
<i> The earth itself
is overflowing with elegance.</i>

01:08:30.738 --> 01:08:34.508
<i> Sophistication. Refinement.</i>

01:08:34.510 --> 01:08:39.947
<i> But those who inhabit it
are far from the world
on which they stand.</i>

01:08:39.948 --> 01:08:44.984
<i> The worst thing that ever
could have happened
to planet Earth,</i>

01:08:45.185 --> 01:08:47.321
<i> human existence.</i>

01:08:47.589 --> 01:08:52.091
<i> The world flourished
for millions of years,
but now it rots.</i>

01:08:52.094 --> 01:08:55.095
<i> And the tenure of man
is to blame.</i>

01:08:56.096 --> 01:09:00.734
<i> I'll no longer tolerate
the abuse I've endured
from society.</i>

01:09:01.035 --> 01:09:03.203
<i> Society makes me sick.</i>

01:09:03.205 --> 01:09:07.908
<i> During those
eight years, how many victims
were there in all?</i>

01:09:07.910 --> 01:09:10.010
<i> Forty-nine.</i>

01:09:10.011 --> 01:09:15.948
<i> We've become reliant
on what we hear
to determine what we think.</i>

01:09:17.152 --> 01:09:22.122
<i> News stations tell us
what to believe,
what to stand for.</i>

01:09:23.625 --> 01:09:29.462
<i> Advertisements tell us
what we must have,
what we cannot live without.</i>

01:09:30.631 --> 01:09:36.435
<i> All the while
we stray further and further
from what truly matters.</i>

01:09:36.438 --> 01:09:39.305
<i> How many of them were men?</i>

01:09:40.375 --> 01:09:42.309
<i> None.</i>

01:09:42.609 --> 01:09:44.645
<i> All women?</i>

01:09:46.247 --> 01:09:48.448
<i> And children.</i>

01:09:49.417 --> 01:09:52.953
<i> As we strive for
progress in the war overseas,</i>

01:09:52.955 --> 01:09:55.889
<i> the one back home
grows more unrelenting.</i>

01:09:56.291 --> 01:09:59.092
<i> Violence headlines
every front page.</i>

01:09:59.094 --> 01:10:02.229
<i> Duress lines
every street corner.</i>

01:10:02.231 --> 01:10:04.498
<i> As the masses turn desperately
to a single man</i>

01:10:04.500 --> 01:10:09.036
<i> to suppress an age-old
quandary of inequality.</i>

01:10:09.537 --> 01:10:12.539
<i> The world should be
ashamed of itself.</i>

01:10:13.107 --> 01:10:15.976
<i> It's become
a frightening place.</i>

01:10:16.844 --> 01:10:22.449
<i> No place for a child,
no place for innocence.</i>

01:10:22.817 --> 01:10:26.320
<i> I bound their
hands behind their backs.</i>

01:10:26.955 --> 01:10:29.423
<i> And then I strangled them.</i>

01:10:29.691 --> 01:10:32.392
<i> Did you rape them?</i>

01:10:33.328 --> 01:10:34.828
<i> Yes.</i>

01:10:34.830 --> 01:10:36.797
<i> All of them?</i>

01:10:37.465 --> 01:10:39.533
<i> Yes.</i>

01:10:43.004 --> 01:10:45.038
<i> The fate of evil
is predetermined.</i>

01:10:45.040 --> 01:10:50.344
<i> Junkies, whores, rapists,
they'll all burn in hell.</i>

01:10:51.145 --> 01:10:55.082
<i> But what will the fate
of a vigilante be?</i>

01:10:57.285 --> 01:11:01.255
<i> I suppose there is only
one way to find out.</i>

01:11:16.604 --> 01:11:19.139
<i> I've seen the worst in man.</i>

01:11:19.574 --> 01:11:21.875
<i> I know what the world needs.</i>

01:11:22.377 --> 01:11:25.045
<i> It needs protection,</i>

01:11:25.446 --> 01:11:29.283
<i> it needs a hero.</i>

01:11:30.551 --> 01:11:34.721
<i> Someone to end the affliction,
to stop the bleeding.</i>

01:11:34.723 --> 01:11:37.524
<i> Someone to show the scum
that they've only existed</i>

01:11:37.526 --> 01:11:40.794
<i> because we've allowed them to.</i>

01:11:40.995 --> 01:11:45.032
<i> Someone to give the filth
what they deserve.</i>

01:11:45.700 --> 01:11:48.535
<i> Someone who
will stand for this</i>

01:11:49.404 --> 01:11:51.938
<i> not a second longer.</i>

01:12:25.707 --> 01:12:28.208
<i> There's no turning back.</i>

01:12:28.443 --> 01:12:30.777
<i> My mind's been made.</i>

01:12:33.147 --> 01:12:35.382
<i> I consider the execution
of the journey</i>

01:12:35.384 --> 01:12:36.550
<i> I'm soon to embark on</i>

01:12:36.552 --> 01:12:41.254
<i> a sacrifice to all of mankind.</i>

01:12:42.924 --> 01:12:45.392
<i> As the souls,
soon to be taken from them,</i>

01:12:45.394 --> 01:12:47.728
<i> will not be of a loss,</i>

01:12:48.162 --> 01:12:50.864
<i> but of a tremendous gain.</i>

01:13:12.053 --> 01:13:13.553
<i> A man is capable of anything,</i>

01:13:13.555 --> 01:13:16.456
<i> once he's lost
his conscience.</i>

01:13:22.797 --> 01:13:24.398
<i> The door's open.</i>

01:13:29.537 --> 01:13:31.405
Come on, Tito.

01:13:36.744 --> 01:13:38.779
Tito, I'm busy.

01:14:37.738 --> 01:14:40.740
<i> Hey, Nicks,
how you doing?</i>

01:14:42.343 --> 01:14:44.945
What are you doing here
so early?

01:14:46.113 --> 01:14:48.582
You wanna go outside?

01:14:49.884 --> 01:14:52.118
I'd like some privacy.

01:15:05.766 --> 01:15:09.269
Nicks, where...
Where are we going?

01:15:16.777 --> 01:15:19.379
Now listen, Marlon, I feel
bad about what happened.

01:15:19.381 --> 01:15:23.250
You were only trying to help,
it wasn't your fault.

01:15:23.252 --> 01:15:26.419
You don't have to say that.
That's nice...
Nice of you to say.

01:15:26.421 --> 01:15:28.788
But you don't have to
say that.

01:15:28.856 --> 01:15:31.057
No, I feel awful about
what happened and I...

01:15:31.059 --> 01:15:35.595
I got you something over here
to show you how sorry I am.

01:15:37.932 --> 01:15:39.432
Okay.

01:15:50.444 --> 01:15:52.812
Did you know that
marijuana is a valuable aid

01:15:52.814 --> 01:15:56.783
in the treatment of
a wide variety
of clinical applications?

01:15:56.785 --> 01:15:58.852
These include pain relief...

01:17:12.693 --> 01:17:14.294
I'm coming.

01:17:14.296 --> 01:17:16.029
Wait right here.

01:17:16.031 --> 01:17:18.431
Yeah, hold on one second.

01:18:43.684 --> 01:18:45.185
Speak into the recorder.

01:18:45.187 --> 01:18:50.290
- I don't care what you say.
Just say it.

01:18:50.524 --> 01:18:55.295
- Say anything. Just say it.

01:19:00.134 --> 01:19:01.634
Say it.

01:19:03.270 --> 01:19:04.738
Say it.

01:19:06.141 --> 01:19:07.006
Say it!

01:19:07.008 --> 01:19:13.446
Okay, I...
I don't understand...
I can't...

01:19:14.181 --> 01:19:17.817
- I can't...
-That's it.

01:19:19.520 --> 01:19:22.889
--That's all I needed.

01:19:34.368 --> 01:19:36.336
What... No.

01:19:58.259 --> 01:20:00.126
Feel my pain.

01:21:00.688 --> 01:21:02.589
I loved you.

01:23:24.465 --> 01:23:26.532
<i> You realize things
you never have before</i>

01:23:26.534 --> 01:23:30.236
<i> when seeing them
for the last time.</i>

01:23:31.438 --> 01:23:33.840
<i> The world looks different.</i>

01:23:33.842 --> 01:23:38.277
<i> Similar to the way I remember
seeing it as a child.</i>

01:23:38.979 --> 01:23:41.981
<i> Clean. Safe.</i>

01:23:42.383 --> 01:23:46.285
<i> Untouched. Not afraid.</i>

01:23:48.889 --> 01:23:52.925
<i> This tape is meant to be
shared with the world.</i>

01:23:53.460 --> 01:23:56.629
<i> It's meant to serve
as my vindication.</i>

01:23:58.665 --> 01:24:02.402
<i> I hope that my story
inspires you.</i>

01:24:02.503 --> 01:24:06.472
<i> I hope that my actions
have given you hope.</i>

01:24:06.774 --> 01:24:09.809
<i> I hope it provokes
all of mankind
to leave the world</i>

01:24:09.811 --> 01:24:13.379
<i> a better place
than when they found it.</i>

01:24:14.181 --> 01:24:16.315
<i> But most importantly,</i>

01:24:16.750 --> 01:24:20.486
<i> I hope that you finally
stop living in fear.</i>

01:24:21.655 --> 01:24:27.160
<i> Sometimes it takes a man
with nothing to lose
to start a revolution.</i>

01:24:27.694 --> 01:24:33.499
<i> But a man with nothing to lose
has nothing to live for.</i>

01:24:34.368 --> 01:24:38.137
<i> And I myself cannot
live with that burden.</i>

01:24:41.842 --> 01:24:44.844
<i> There's good
left in the world.</i>

01:24:45.846 --> 01:24:48.014
<i> There really is.</i>

01:26:59.613 --> 01:27:01.581
<i> Sanchez.</i>

01:27:03.318 --> 01:27:05.985
<i> What's this kid's name again?</i>

01:27:09.656 --> 01:27:11.824
Detective Nicks,

01:27:11.826 --> 01:27:14.894
you don't know
how sorry I am
for your loss.

01:27:19.066 --> 01:27:20.666
Tommy,

01:27:21.902 --> 01:27:24.971
your brother left behind
a recording.

01:27:25.672 --> 01:27:28.674
Seems he used it like a diary.

01:27:31.378 --> 01:27:32.345
Towards the end
of the recording,

01:27:32.347 --> 01:27:37.917
he admits to killing
four people
prior to taking his own life.

01:27:40.988 --> 01:27:42.154
He told us who they were,

01:27:42.156 --> 01:27:45.091
where they worked,
where they lived

01:27:45.325 --> 01:27:48.027
and where he left
their bodies.

01:27:48.862 --> 01:27:53.466
I sent a couple of men
out this morning
to locate them, but...

01:27:54.501 --> 01:27:55.935
Uh...

01:27:57.104 --> 01:27:59.505
There were no bodies.

01:28:02.376 --> 01:28:07.179
The only person
your brother killed
was himself.

01:28:11.785 --> 01:28:14.654
<i> I took a ride
over to the place
where your brother worked</i>

01:28:14.656 --> 01:28:15.788
<i> and questioned the owner.</i>

01:28:15.790 --> 01:28:19.392
<i> He told me that
in his 20 years
of owning that theater,</i>

01:28:19.394 --> 01:28:20.426
<i> he's never had
a night manager</i>

01:28:20.428 --> 01:28:24.330
<i> and never employed anyone
by the name of Frank.</i>

01:28:26.533 --> 01:28:28.901
<i> In the recording your brother
claimed that he met someone</i>

01:28:28.903 --> 01:28:31.704
<i> for coffee every morning
after his shift.</i>

01:28:31.706 --> 01:28:34.240
<i> I spoke to the waiter
who works the graveyard shift.</i>

01:28:34.242 --> 01:28:39.345
<i> He said Jacob
never had company
and was always by himself.</i>

01:28:43.483 --> 01:28:45.951
<i> He had been seeing a girl
for the last few months,</i>

01:28:45.953 --> 01:28:48.821
<i> so I stopped by her apartment,</i>

01:28:48.823 --> 01:28:50.289
<i> but it was empty.</i>

01:28:50.291 --> 01:28:53.492
<i> The landlord told me that
he rented the place out to
Jacob several months ago</i>

01:28:53.494 --> 01:28:58.664
<i> and he never saw anyone else
coming and going
from the unit.</i>

01:29:01.968 --> 01:29:04.837
<i> We found a huge amount of film
in your brother's apartment.</i>

01:29:04.839 --> 01:29:08.941
<i> I went to the place where
he got it developed
and questioned the owner.</i>

01:29:08.943 --> 01:29:12.511
<i> He said that one night,
while processing some
of Jacob's film,</i>

01:29:12.513 --> 01:29:14.747
<i> something unusual
caught his eye.</i>

01:29:14.749 --> 01:29:18.184
<i> And he couldn't help
taking a closer look.</i>

01:29:25.459 --> 01:29:27.693
What was it, sir?

01:29:30.297 --> 01:29:32.198
<i> Yeah, my friend.
He's my friend,</i>

01:29:32.200 --> 01:29:34.533
<i> what's so hard
to believe about that.</i>

01:29:34.535 --> 01:29:37.670
Got you that goddamn coffee,
didn't we?

01:29:41.007 --> 01:29:44.343
I don't know
what happened, Frank.

01:29:44.578 --> 01:29:48.948
<i> She works late, besides
that's what I got you for.</i>

01:29:48.950 --> 01:29:49.448
Ivana!

01:29:49.450 --> 01:29:53.119
<i> Marlon, you are
the most interesting person
I think I've ever met.</i>

01:29:53.121 --> 01:29:53.819
<i> Everyone calls me Nicks.</i>

01:29:53.821 --> 01:29:55.454
<i> Why don't you take
my phone calls?</i>

01:29:55.456 --> 01:29:56.822
<i> I don't want to talk about it.</i>

01:29:56.824 --> 01:29:59.925
<i> Now listen, Marlon, I feel
bad about what happened.</i>

01:29:59.927 --> 01:30:01.060
<i> I need something strong.</i>

01:30:01.062 --> 01:30:02.294
<i> I thought we had something.</i>

01:30:02.296 --> 01:30:03.195
<i> I thought I was good for you.</i>

01:30:03.197 --> 01:30:04.163
<i> What you are
is a worthless....</i>

01:30:04.165 --> 01:30:06.065
<i> I'd like to think I was more
than one of your clients.</i>

01:30:06.067 --> 01:30:06.799
<i> ...homeless piece of shit.</i>

01:30:06.801 --> 01:30:09.135
<i> Do you know, because of you,
I'm hooked on this shit.</i>

01:30:09.137 --> 01:30:10.202
<i> Ivana...</i>

01:30:10.204 --> 01:30:11.704
<i> Get out!</i>

01:30:17.577 --> 01:30:20.713
<i> These people didn't exist.</i>

01:30:21.148 --> 01:30:26.152
They weren't real.
Not one of them.

01:30:34.761 --> 01:30:36.195
Tommy,

01:30:37.230 --> 01:30:39.832
do you know the man
in this picture?

01:30:40.367 --> 01:30:45.404
You're brother claims this man
had been following him
for the past couple of months.

01:30:47.808 --> 01:30:49.708
Where did you find this?

01:30:49.710 --> 01:30:52.845
In your brother's apartment.

01:30:57.350 --> 01:31:00.653
So, you know the people
in the picture?

01:31:01.455 --> 01:31:04.990
Yeah, that's me there
on the left and...

01:31:04.992 --> 01:31:09.128
...my little brother, Jacob,
there on the right.

01:31:11.398 --> 01:31:13.866
And the man in the middle?

01:31:18.371 --> 01:31:20.673
That was our father.

01:31:21.975 --> 01:31:23.476
Hmm.

01:31:24.377 --> 01:31:29.048
The day this picture was taken
was the last time
we ever saw him.

01:31:29.050 --> 01:31:34.186
He shipped out
and was killed in combat
a couple of weeks later.

01:31:37.424 --> 01:31:41.227
From what I remember,
he was a good father.

01:31:43.930 --> 01:31:46.999
He and Jacob had this
special bond.

01:31:47.734 --> 01:31:49.902
They loved movies.

01:31:50.203 --> 01:31:52.137
I hated them.

01:31:59.079 --> 01:32:02.515
My brother was a war hero,
you know?

01:32:04.351 --> 01:32:07.486
He was a POW for eight months.

01:32:08.488 --> 01:32:11.657
They tortured the poor kid
every day for eight months

01:32:11.659 --> 01:32:14.593
and he told them nothing.

01:32:17.731 --> 01:32:20.766
And when he got home,
I...

01:32:22.235 --> 01:32:25.437
I'd never been so happy
my whole life.

01:32:27.841 --> 01:32:33.579
You know, I quickly realized
that he wasn't the same.

01:32:35.715 --> 01:32:37.683
He looked like Jacob and...

01:32:37.685 --> 01:32:41.153
And he sounded
like Jacob, but...

01:32:46.326 --> 01:32:48.260
...it wasn't him.

01:32:50.196 --> 01:32:52.231
They killed him.

01:32:53.199 --> 01:32:55.734
His body came home, but...

01:32:56.536 --> 01:32:58.637
He was already gone.

01:33:04.778 --> 01:33:07.947
Again, my deepest condolences.

01:33:12.953 --> 01:33:17.590
Tommy, I'm gonna do
whatever I can
to keep this quiet.

01:33:17.958 --> 01:33:20.059
There will be an
ongoing investigation,

01:33:20.061 --> 01:33:20.726
I can't stop that,

01:33:20.728 --> 01:33:24.897
but I can promise you
that I will do everything

01:33:24.899 --> 01:33:28.300
to keep this as
low-key as possible.

01:33:29.235 --> 01:33:30.536
Yeah.

01:33:32.205 --> 01:33:35.407
And, um, the reels, sir?

01:33:36.343 --> 01:33:37.810
Hmm.

01:33:41.214 --> 01:33:47.286
Well, I don't know anything
about any reels, Tommy.

01:33:48.188 --> 01:33:50.089
But if I did,

01:33:53.226 --> 01:33:56.662
I'd say they've been
taken care of.

01:34:00.200 --> 01:34:02.134
Thank you, sir,

01:34:03.336 --> 01:34:05.371
for everything.

01:34:08.074 --> 01:34:09.508
Lieutenant,

01:34:12.579 --> 01:34:14.680
can I hear the tape?

01:34:26.760 --> 01:34:28.694
<i> Speak into the recorder.</i>

01:34:28.696 --> 01:34:33.098
<i> I don't care what you say,
just say it.</i>

01:34:33.733 --> 01:34:38.070
<i> Say anything. Just say it.</i>

01:34:41.608 --> 01:34:46.145
<i> Say it. Say it.</i>

01:34:47.947 --> 01:34:50.416
<i> Say it!</i>

01:34:58.591 --> 01:35:00.325
<i> That's it.</i>

01:35:02.862 --> 01:35:05.330
<i> That's all I needed.</i>
