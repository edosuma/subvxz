02:03.323 --> 02:04.625
Jennifer's getting back today.

02:04.658 --> 02:07.260
Do you think I should've
called her in Rome?

02:07.293 --> 02:08.695
I mean, I don't
wanna be pushy

02:08.729 --> 02:11.431

for me to make the first move.

understand exactly

02:18.204 --> 02:19.172
Well..

02:31.384 --> 02:34.588
Nancy and I have
a wonderful relationship.

02:39.993 --> 02:41.361
Very sensitive.

I'm, I'm trying to share
a personal problem here

02:45.966 --> 02:47.701

‐ No.
‐ Aren't you?

‐ No.

02:53.674 --> 02:54.608
Yes, I am.

How am I gonna find out
how she feels about me?

03:17.864 --> 03:19.600
You have to interpret

of what they say
or don't say.

The way they look at you
or don't look at you.

The way they touch you
or as in my case..

03:28.008 --> 03:29.543
...don't touch you.

03:32.412 --> 03:33.680
Boy, life is hard work
for you.

Cousin, why don't
we just have Mary Ann

03:37.818 --> 03:39.553
and Jennifer over
for dinner tonight

03:39.586 --> 03:40.987
and Mary Ann and I can eat

03:41.021 --> 03:43.289

can read each other?

03:46.860 --> 03:48.328
I'll have to give
that some thought.

‐ Hi, guys.
‐ Hello. How was your flight?

03:54.434 --> 03:55.802
‐ Great.
‐ It was great.

03:55.836 --> 03:57.437
Thanks for the travel alarm,
Larry.

03:57.470 --> 03:58.705
Oh, any time, Jennifer.

03:58.739 --> 04:00.340
Boy, working those
flights to Rome

04:00.373 --> 04:01.808
really play tricks
on your mind.

04:01.842 --> 04:03.309
Is it Friday or Saturday?

04:04.811 --> 04:05.879
It's Friday.

04:05.912 --> 04:07.614
I told you.

04:07.648 --> 04:08.649
I wanted
a second opinion, okay?

04:10.851 --> 04:13.820
Hey, why don't you come over
to our house for dinner tonight?

04:13.854 --> 04:16.623
You can relax
and shake off your jet slag.

04:19.993 --> 04:21.628
That sounds great.
We'd love to.

04:21.661 --> 04:22.996
Are you sure
it isn't too much trouble?

04:23.029 --> 04:24.397
Of course not,
is it, cousin?

04:24.430 --> 04:27.067
Oh! Trouble? No, no.

04:27.100 --> 04:28.769
We'll just throw
something together.

04:28.802 --> 04:30.871
We'll uncork some vino,
kick back, relax.

04:30.904 --> 04:32.906
It'll be very, uh, mellow.

04:34.508 --> 04:35.709
Great. Come on, Jennifer

04:35.742 --> 04:36.810
we need to get up
to the apartment.

04:36.843 --> 04:37.811
I may have left the gas on.

04:39.513 --> 04:42.849
Mary Ann,
if you'd left the gas on

04:42.883 --> 04:44.050
the building wouldn't be here.

04:45.385 --> 04:46.452
Well, that's good news.

04:53.560 --> 04:56.530

‐ Do what?

04:56.563 --> 04:58.665
Ask the girls
to dinner tonight.

04:58.699 --> 05:00.601
I just did.

05:00.634 --> 05:02.869
Yes, why?

05:02.903 --> 05:05.572
Oh, oh. Why did I ask
the girls to dinner tonight?

05:05.606 --> 05:07.440
‐ Why?
‐ Why not?

You just don't
get it, do you?

05:17.017 --> 05:20.486
We have a lot to do
and not enough time to do it.

05:20.521 --> 05:23.056
But, cousin, it would
be just like you said.

05:23.089 --> 05:26.026
We'll relax, do some kickbacks,
we'll be marshmallows.

05:29.495 --> 05:30.831
What the big deal is?

05:30.864 --> 05:33.499
Look, I'll tell you
what the big deal is, oh.

is a sophisticated woman.

05:42.108 --> 05:45.879
She's been in every
airport in the world.

05:45.912 --> 05:46.813
Now, if I'm going to impress her

05:46.847 --> 05:48.582
I have to have
the right food, the right wine

05:48.615 --> 05:50.016
the right lighting.

05:50.050 --> 05:53.687
This evening has got to be
very carefully orchestrated.

05:53.720 --> 05:56.456
Cousin, you are taking
this too seriously.

05:56.489 --> 05:58.525
You're going to get
simple nervous tension.

06:00.594 --> 06:04.598
Did you know...you're
getting on my nerves?

06:04.631 --> 06:05.866
I have to plan what could be

06:05.899 --> 06:07.634
the most important
dinner of my life

06:07.668 --> 06:09.703
and I've only
got three hours.

06:09.736 --> 06:10.571
Well, don't worry, I can help.

06:10.604 --> 06:12.539
Oh, I think
you've helped quite enough.

06:12.573 --> 06:14.941
‐ But‐but I want to help cook.
‐ No.

06:14.975 --> 06:16.877
‐ I want to help cook.
‐ No, you can't help cook.

06:16.910 --> 06:17.878
‐ I want to help cook.
‐ Oh..

06:20.781 --> 06:23.049
Alright, alright.
You can help cook.

06:23.083 --> 06:25.051
‐ Okay.
‐ Look.

06:25.085 --> 06:27.187
You get the stuff for
the appetizers and the salad.

06:27.220 --> 06:28.421
And what else?

06:28.454 --> 06:30.090
Just the appetizers
and the salad.

06:30.123 --> 06:31.157
While you're doing that

06:31.191 --> 06:32.793
I'll go to the butcher.

This is the salad?

I can't help but notice
there's no lettuce in there.

Well, you said we should
impress the girls

08:19.833 --> 08:20.601
That's not very impressive.

So I decided to make
mama's special salad.

Wild olives, ginkgo root,
mustard curd, onions

08:28.141 --> 08:30.276
and a dash of liver oil
to keep the ginkgo root down.

the lettuce, did you?

No, I didn't.

It was on my list.

08:40.086 --> 08:42.956
And bean and curd
things were not.

Well, pardon me
for saying so

And that's why Balki

08:54.300 --> 08:56.603

to spice the menu up.

08:56.637 --> 08:58.772
Just how spicy
are we getting?

08:58.805 --> 08:59.673

of the Myposian diet.

They made me into the big,

I don't want Jennifer
to be a big strong man.

enough to bear my children.

10:01.668 --> 10:03.904

I had to find
gingko root and pig snout.

11:02.228 --> 11:03.664
They made fun of me
at the market.

11:05.866 --> 11:07.367
They said,
"Price check on pig snout."

11:15.742 --> 11:17.878
And now you won't
let me serve it.

11:17.911 --> 11:20.013
You're squeezing all
of the fun out of this date.

11:20.046 --> 11:23.316
Balki, I am squeezing
all the fun out of this date

11:23.349 --> 11:24.384
for a very good reason.

11:24.417 --> 11:27.453

is nothing to be taken lightly.

12:14.535 --> 12:17.403
Well, that's the temperature I
need for my sheepherder's bread.

12:17.437 --> 12:19.906
Where did sheepherder's bread
come from?

12:19.940 --> 12:22.275
Well, I think it's origins are
a little island off the coast..

12:22.308 --> 12:24.377
I don't care where it came from.

12:24.410 --> 12:25.445
Well, why did you ask?

12:25.478 --> 12:27.180
Look at my duck.

12:27.213 --> 12:28.414
It's drying out
even as we speak.

12:28.448 --> 12:30.216
How am I gonna serve this?

12:30.250 --> 12:32.152
Well, how bout with two
little white hats on the feet?

12:35.388 --> 12:36.456
Oh, cousin, cheer up.

12:36.489 --> 12:38.959
I made enough Ding Ding Machmood
for the whole village.

12:38.992 --> 12:39.793
Balki.

12:43.363 --> 12:44.898
I am not letting
you serve that food.

12:44.931 --> 12:46.332
Well, maybe you can stop me.

12:46.366 --> 12:47.968
Oh, well, maybe I can.

12:48.001 --> 12:49.936
Give me the
Ding Ding Machmood.

12:49.970 --> 12:51.371
No.

12:51.404 --> 12:52.305
Give me the
Ding Ding Machmood.

12:52.338 --> 12:53.507
No.

12:53.540 --> 12:54.841
Give me the
Ding Ding Machmood.

12:54.875 --> 12:56.109
[knocking on door]

12:56.142 --> 12:56.677
[gasps]

12:59.946 --> 13:01.147
(together)
The girls.

13:01.181 --> 13:04.050
Alright, look, let's put aside
our petty little differences

13:04.084 --> 13:06.252
and your food and try
to get through this thing.

13:08.254 --> 13:09.523
Well, I'm not the one
with the problem.

13:09.556 --> 13:10.591
‐ You're the one with a problem.
‐ Yes.

13:10.624 --> 13:13.493
I'm the one with the problem
and you're the problem.

13:13.527 --> 13:15.061
I'm just trying to show
a lady a good time.

13:15.095 --> 13:16.863
I'm just trying to show
a lady a good time.

13:16.897 --> 13:18.264
Well, fine.
Have a good time.

13:18.298 --> 13:20.300
‐ Oh, have a good time?
‐ Have a ball.

13:20.333 --> 13:22.035
Knock yourself out.

13:22.068 --> 13:23.504
(together)
Have a wonderful time!

13:24.871 --> 13:25.572
(Balki and Larry)
Hi.

13:39.052 --> 13:40.453
Thank you, Balki.

13:40.486 --> 13:42.422
This is just like one
of those fancy restaurants.

13:43.489 --> 13:45.025
‐ May I?
‐ May you what?

14:07.380 --> 14:09.315
Dinner is served.

14:11.685 --> 14:12.919
Did I mention
how lovely you look?

14:14.354 --> 14:16.422
Yes, you did.

14:16.456 --> 14:17.591
W‐what are we having?

14:18.992 --> 14:22.062
Glazed carrots,
wild rice

14:22.095 --> 14:25.899
and my specialty,
duck a l'orange.

14:29.970 --> 14:31.505
But the best things
aren't even on the table.

14:32.405 --> 14:33.540
Ooh, there's more?

14:33.574 --> 14:36.442
Ah, yes, well, uh, Balki thought
there might not be enough

14:36.476 --> 14:37.678
so he cooked too.

14:37.711 --> 14:40.246
But as you can see, I think
there's plenty for everybody.

14:40.280 --> 14:41.114
Just dig in.

14:43.283 --> 14:45.218
[scraping]

14:54.327 --> 14:56.062
[tapping]

14:56.096 --> 14:57.430
[scraping]

14:57.463 --> 14:58.599
Darn, dull knives.

15:00.233 --> 15:01.234
Balki, I told you
to get these sharpened.

15:01.267 --> 15:02.102
I'll get them sharpened.

15:06.973 --> 15:08.975
Why is the rice
all clumped together?

15:14.681 --> 15:15.649
Well, girls, you're in luck

15:15.682 --> 15:17.383
because silly Balki

15:17.417 --> 15:18.619
has food in the kitchen.

15:18.652 --> 15:21.988
Oh. Keep eating,
keep eating. Enjoy. Enjoy.

15:23.690 --> 15:26.092
Balki, you are not serving them

15:26.126 --> 15:27.493
tha‐tha‐tha‐that stuff.

15:29.195 --> 15:30.697
Why don't we ask them
if they want to try

15:30.731 --> 15:32.065
tha‐tha‐that stuff?

15:33.399 --> 15:35.235
Who would like
to try Myposian food?

15:35.268 --> 15:36.503
‐ I would.
‐ Sounds great.

15:41.441 --> 15:44.010
I've never had Myposian food
before. This is exciting.

15:47.480 --> 15:48.682
This looks interesting.

15:55.355 --> 15:57.157
This looks incredible.

15:57.190 --> 15:58.525
Balki, what do you call this?

15:58.559 --> 16:00.093
Ding Ding Machmood.

16:00.126 --> 16:02.529
Oh, well,
what does that mean?

16:02.563 --> 16:03.564
Pig snout with saffron.

16:09.469 --> 16:10.270
Excuse us.

16:33.527 --> 16:35.461
I hope you're happy
you're making me look bad

16:35.495 --> 16:36.496
in front of Jennifer.

16:36.530 --> 16:37.798
I think you are
doing that yourself.

16:37.831 --> 16:39.332
None of this would've
happened if you had followed

16:39.365 --> 16:40.466
a few simple instructions

16:40.500 --> 16:43.103
but n‐o‐o,
you had to be creative.

16:43.136 --> 16:45.271
You had the wonderful idea
to serve the girls pig pucks.

16:50.544 --> 16:52.312
You're just jealous
because I need a chainsaw

16:52.345 --> 16:53.279
to cut your duck.

16:57.183 --> 16:58.118
Well, in case you
haven't noticed

16:58.151 --> 17:00.153
they're not exactly
scarfing up the snout.

17:03.256 --> 17:04.324
It's an acquired taste.

17:04.357 --> 17:05.425
(Larry)
'Oh, is it?'

17:05.458 --> 17:09.162
Uh, maybe this isn't
a good time for us to be here.

17:09.194 --> 17:11.698
Why? Because Balki is acting
like a five‐year‐old?

17:11.732 --> 17:14.467
Me? You're the one that's
acting like a yak's behind.

17:14.500 --> 17:16.803
‐ Oh, a yak's behind?
‐ Yes, a big fat one..

17:16.837 --> 17:18.371
Balki, Larry, stop.

17:21.307 --> 17:22.108
Do you have any ketchup?

17:26.813 --> 17:29.149
Come on, Mary Anne.
I think we'd better go.

17:29.182 --> 17:30.584
‐ Oh. Is dinner over?
‐ Mm‐hmm.

17:30.617 --> 17:33.319
No, don't go,
don't go. We'll be good.

17:33.353 --> 17:35.388
No, no, you have to stay.
We have pie.

17:35.421 --> 17:37.123
I know it's good.
I didn't make it.

17:38.825 --> 17:41.327
You guys have to work
this thing out, whatever it is.

17:41.361 --> 17:43.429
Arguments happen
between roommates.

17:43.463 --> 17:45.231
Believe me, I understand.

17:45.265 --> 17:47.534
Mary Anne and I get on each
other's nerves sometimes.

17:47.568 --> 17:49.235
Like when?

17:49.269 --> 17:51.505
Like, when she spends
three hours

17:51.538 --> 17:53.774
in the bathroom putting
on her makeup.

17:53.807 --> 17:55.709
Oh, yeah.
She hates when I do that.

17:55.742 --> 17:57.578
[laughing]

17:57.611 --> 17:58.845
[all sighing]

18:01.915 --> 18:04.785
And I hate when she rearranges
my closet without asking me.

18:07.588 --> 18:10.423
Well, I wouldn't have to if
you'd keep your things in order.

18:12.793 --> 18:15.461
Well, everyone has their
own way of doing things.

18:17.163 --> 18:18.865
Maybe the way I keep
my things is my business.

18:20.433 --> 18:21.234
Good point.
That's a very good point.

18:23.804 --> 18:26.607
Fine. I won't touch your things.

18:26.640 --> 18:29.409
Just don't come begging me
to borrow a clean uniform

18:29.442 --> 18:30.844
because you didn't realize
yours were at the cleaners.

18:31.912 --> 18:33.680
Well..

18:33.714 --> 18:35.281
...here's to good friends.

18:38.251 --> 18:40.721
Once, just once I borrowed
a uniform and got a spot on it

18:40.754 --> 18:42.288
and you never let me forget it.

18:42.322 --> 18:43.624
Maybe if you were
more careful on the job

18:43.657 --> 18:45.559
you wouldn't have
spilled anything.

18:45.592 --> 18:48.629
Oh, so, now you're gonna
tell me how to do my job?

18:48.662 --> 18:50.631
Who wants pie?

18:50.664 --> 18:53.399
Well, somebody should tell
you how to do your job.

18:53.433 --> 18:55.468
While I'm working my tail off,
trying to make the flight

18:55.502 --> 18:57.738
a safe and pleasant experience,
you're serving drinks

18:57.771 --> 18:59.205
singing "Belly Up
to the Bar, Boys."

18:59.239 --> 19:00.507
Alright, Jennifer.

19:00.541 --> 19:02.709
Well, excuse me for being
nice to the passengers

19:02.743 --> 19:04.811
at least when we're about
to land, I don't tell them

19:04.845 --> 19:06.446
"Return your seat
to the upright position

19:06.479 --> 19:07.648
or I'll call the authorities."

19:10.884 --> 19:11.885
Those are the rules.

19:13.720 --> 19:15.822
You were a pain in high school
and you're a pain now.

19:15.856 --> 19:17.323
Everything has to be perfect.

19:17.357 --> 19:19.626
Perfect hair, perfect clothes.
Perfect manners.

19:19.660 --> 19:20.927
It's like living
with a Barbie doll.

19:26.332 --> 19:27.801
Now, I'm mad.

19:27.834 --> 19:29.803
[indistinct shouting]

19:29.836 --> 19:30.937
Hold.

19:34.708 --> 19:36.943
Mary Anne, Jennifer

19:36.977 --> 19:39.713
you shouldn't talk to each other
like that, you're friends.

19:40.947 --> 19:42.949
Look, this is,
this is all my fault

19:42.983 --> 19:44.484
and I'm sorry.

19:44.518 --> 19:47.420
I‐I burnt the duck,
the rice stuck together.

19:47.453 --> 19:48.755
Nothing worked.

19:48.789 --> 19:50.423
Cousin, you're not helping.

19:53.994 --> 19:55.228
Sorry.

19:55.929 --> 19:56.730
Shame on you.

19:58.999 --> 20:00.266
How long have you
known each other?

20:00.300 --> 20:01.735
‐ Too long.
‐ How long?

20:01.768 --> 20:03.303
Since we were
eight years old.

20:03.336 --> 20:05.872
And now you're going to
throw your friendship away

20:05.906 --> 20:07.841
because you think
she's too perfect

20:07.874 --> 20:09.475
and you think
she's not perfect enough?

20:13.413 --> 20:16.416
Mary Anne, tell Jennifer
that you're sorry

20:16.449 --> 20:18.619
and if it's really
that important, well

20:18.652 --> 20:20.320
you'll try to be
a little more organized.

20:22.956 --> 20:24.958
I'm sorry.

20:24.991 --> 20:26.392
Perhaps I am a little messy.

20:27.327 --> 20:28.529
Jennifer?

20:28.562 --> 20:32.365
Tell Mary Anne you're sorry
and you'll try to take things

20:32.398 --> 20:33.333
a little less seriously.

20:36.436 --> 20:38.839
I'm sorry, sometimes
I get all worked up

20:38.872 --> 20:40.340
over things that
aren't very important

20:40.373 --> 20:41.942
but that Barbie doll
line really hurt.

20:42.976 --> 20:44.344
I'm sorry.

20:45.512 --> 20:47.447
Now, hug each other.

20:58.792 --> 20:59.860
Like you mean it.

21:02.929 --> 21:04.631
‐ I'm sorry, Mary Anne.
‐ Oh, me too.

21:05.766 --> 21:06.767
Now, hug me.

21:11.905 --> 21:13.039
Like you mean it.

21:15.542 --> 21:16.643
Ah, yes, well, uh

21:16.677 --> 21:18.745
now that we have
that settled, uh

21:18.779 --> 21:20.313
why don't we
get back to dinner?

21:28.655 --> 21:29.489
Well, who are we kidding?

21:29.523 --> 21:31.291
All those in favor
of ordering pizza?

21:33.927 --> 21:35.529
Might as well.

21:35.562 --> 21:36.530
My Ding Ding's cold.

21:44.838 --> 21:47.340
You really have to leave?
It's only 1 o'clock.

21:47.373 --> 21:49.510
I'm exhausted.
We're still on Rome time.

21:49.543 --> 21:50.844
To us, it's 7 o'clock
in the morning.

21:51.712 --> 21:52.913
Goodnight, Balki.

21:58.685 --> 22:00.486
I had a nice time.

22:00.521 --> 22:01.822
I'm really glad
I got to know you better.

22:05.792 --> 22:07.628
Let's go, Mary Anne.

22:07.661 --> 22:08.595
Goodnight.

22:18.805 --> 22:19.806
Did you hear that?

22:21.742 --> 22:22.976
She knows me better.

22:27.748 --> 22:29.482
‐ Better than what?
‐ Let's not analyze it.

22:31.885 --> 22:33.119
I just want to
enjoy the moment.

22:34.588 --> 22:36.557
[inhaling sharply]

22:36.590 --> 22:37.123
[both sigh]

22:41.061 --> 22:42.128
Well, it was
really rough going.

22:45.799 --> 22:47.834
If we hadn't been there, they'd
probably still be fighting.

22:47.868 --> 22:50.136
Yes, but if we hadn't
have been there

22:50.170 --> 22:51.404
they probably wouldn't have
fought at all.

22:54.140 --> 22:56.943
Well, you know, I‐I didn't know
Jennifer could be that way.

22:56.977 --> 22:58.078
What way?

22:58.111 --> 22:59.445
So..

22:59.479 --> 23:01.047
...nitpicky.

23:01.081 --> 23:03.383
I mean, I know Mary Anne's
no rocket scientist, but..

23:05.819 --> 23:07.688
Jennifer shouldn't be
so hard on her.

23:07.721 --> 23:10.456
Well, I had no idea
Mary Anne could be that way.

23:10.490 --> 23:11.491
What way?

23:11.525 --> 23:13.026
Cousin..

23:13.059 --> 23:15.128
...the wires up here
don't connect.

23:22.536 --> 23:25.806
I mean, Jennifer is a little
crazy about being neat

23:25.839 --> 23:27.007
but Mary Anne
was pretty hard on her.

23:28.675 --> 23:30.076
Must be difficult
for them to live together

23:30.110 --> 23:32.513
when they're so different.

23:32.546 --> 23:35.215
Well, if they're gonna stay best
friends and still live together

23:35.248 --> 23:37.784
they're gonna have
to learn to compromise.

23:37.818 --> 23:40.086
I mean, good friends
are hard to come by.

23:48.962 --> 23:52.833
Mary Anne...could be
a little more organized.

23:54.234 --> 23:57.838
Yeah and Jennifer
could loosen up a bit.

24:00.907 --> 24:01.942
I'm sorry I made
fun of your food.

24:01.975 --> 24:03.610
'It's okay.'

24:03.644 --> 24:06.079
I'm sorry I invite
the girls without asking you.

24:06.112 --> 24:08.715
That's okay.

24:08.749 --> 24:10.517
If I had to wait to get up the
nerve, think how tense I'd be.

24:12.085 --> 24:13.754
That's a scary thought.

24:16.156 --> 24:19.092
[instrumental music]

24:22.028 --> 24:23.129
Well, I guess I can
throw this out.

24:23.163 --> 24:25.198
No! Don't throw that out.

24:25.231 --> 24:26.633
I'm gonna freeze
the Ding Ding Machmood.

24:27.634 --> 24:28.735
Why?

24:28.769 --> 24:30.971
You haven't lived until
you've had snout on a stick.

24:34.808 --> 24:37.544
[instrumental music]

24:39.780 --> 24:42.516
[theme music]
