00:01.262 --> 00:02.828
[Raelle]
Previously, onMotherland...

00:02.872 --> 00:03.916
The Mother won't be able

00:03.960 --> 00:05.353
to bring you back anymore.

00:05.396 --> 00:06.876
And that world above

00:06.919 --> 00:07.877
is even worse
than you left it.

00:07.920 --> 00:09.705
That's why I need
to go back, Mom.

00:09.922 --> 00:11.881
Silver's about to order me
to invade the Cession.

00:11.924 --> 00:13.752
[Anacostia] So the trick is
to go along with it?

00:13.796 --> 00:16.886
Until we can get Wade back and
put an end to this whole thing.

00:16.929 --> 00:20.672
-[groans]
-[whistles]

00:20.716 --> 00:22.500
-[Abigail] What just happened?
-[Anacostia] His armor.

00:22.544 --> 00:24.937
Congratulations.

00:24.981 --> 00:26.939
You just caught yourself
an even bigger prize.

00:26.983 --> 00:29.333
Don't you know
where they're taking you?

00:29.377 --> 00:31.118
We've been calling it
the Slaughterhouse.

00:31.161 --> 00:34.730
[screams]

00:34.773 --> 00:36.688
[Tally] She was destroying
the world with the Witchbomb.

00:36.732 --> 00:39.691
I don't know when or why,
but I know it's coming.

00:39.735 --> 00:42.216
[Santos] That is from
the extinct steward's line.

00:42.259 --> 00:44.218
But unfortunately, the song

00:44.261 --> 00:45.784
had never been
passed down to her.

00:45.828 --> 00:47.351
[Alder]
The only thing more powerful

00:47.395 --> 00:49.571
than the Witchbomb
is through the First Song.

00:49.614 --> 00:52.574
You're going to learn
to see in the past.

00:56.752 --> 00:58.145
[gasps]

01:18.948 --> 01:20.993
[men exclaiming]

01:31.787 --> 01:33.876
[exclaiming continues]

01:39.795 --> 01:41.840
[exclaiming continues]

01:59.989 --> 02:01.121
[gasps]

02:05.081 --> 02:06.865
Stop!

02:06.909 --> 02:08.389
[speaking foreign language]

02:16.440 --> 02:18.442
[vocalizing]

02:21.924 --> 02:23.360
[men gasping, grunting]

02:42.945 --> 02:46.949
-[gasping loudly]
-[vocalizing through music box]

02:53.129 --> 02:55.087
Did the Song lead you to her?

02:55.131 --> 02:57.264
[vocalizing continues]

02:57.307 --> 02:58.656
I know where she is.

03:00.223 --> 03:01.877
-[Tally sighs]
-[music box stops]

03:02.921 --> 03:03.879
We leave at daybreak.

03:03.922 --> 03:06.055
Hold on, leave where?

03:06.098 --> 03:09.014
Harz mountain range.
Northern Germany.

03:09.058 --> 03:10.929
N-- Tally, no.

03:10.973 --> 03:12.714
-We need you here.
-[Tally] No.

03:12.757 --> 03:16.674
What we need to do is find
the last two pieces of the Song.

03:16.718 --> 03:18.546
It's the only thing that
can prevent what I saw.

03:18.589 --> 03:20.896
Tally, I'm not gonna end
the world with the Witchbomb.

03:20.939 --> 03:23.203
You may not have a choice.
In the vision,

03:23.246 --> 03:25.683
it didn't look like
you had a lot of control.

03:25.727 --> 03:27.859
How do you know
the First Song can stop it?

03:27.903 --> 03:29.818
It's not about knowing.

03:29.861 --> 03:31.472
It's about trusting
the Mother.

03:31.515 --> 03:32.951
I'm sorry, but
that's not enough.

03:32.995 --> 03:35.476
Then trust me.

03:35.519 --> 03:38.914
I know in the past, I've
given you cause to doubt me.

03:38.957 --> 03:41.960
Please. This is more important
than you can know.

03:46.791 --> 03:49.229
[theme playing]

04:49.941 --> 04:52.335
Promise me you won't
use the Witchbomb.

04:52.379 --> 04:53.858
-Tal...
-Promise!

04:53.902 --> 04:55.207
OK, fine, I promise,

04:55.251 --> 04:56.905
but whatever you saw
won't happen.

04:56.948 --> 04:59.124
I can't even detonate
a Witchbomb that big.

04:59.168 --> 05:00.561
And after what my mom told me,

05:00.604 --> 05:02.911
I have no desire
to test my mortality again.

05:02.954 --> 05:05.522
I don't like this, Tally.
We should go with you.

05:05.566 --> 05:07.394
No, you need to be here.
Find Scylla,

05:07.437 --> 05:09.352
and help the Cession
in whatever way you can.

05:09.396 --> 05:11.920
Don't bother arguing.
I've already Seen

05:11.963 --> 05:13.356
that I walk out
that door solo.

05:13.400 --> 05:15.924
Did you just look ahead
to the end of the argument?

05:15.967 --> 05:17.317
-I--
-[Raelle] Has she
done this to you before?

05:17.360 --> 05:19.884
Jerk move, right? Wait until
you actually need her

05:19.928 --> 05:22.017
to See something useful,
then she's all,

05:22.060 --> 05:23.845
"Oh, it's hazy, I don't know!"

05:23.888 --> 05:26.717
[gasps] That is so not true,
and you know it!

05:26.761 --> 05:28.066
[all chuckle]

05:31.940 --> 05:34.029
I can't believe you're
leaving. I just got back.

05:34.072 --> 05:37.337
Mm. Be safe, Tal.

05:40.775 --> 05:41.776
[door opens]

05:44.082 --> 05:45.693
-[car horn honks]
-[door closes]

06:08.759 --> 06:11.327
What are you doing
wandering around here, Army?

06:11.371 --> 06:14.591
Looking for you, Batan.

06:14.635 --> 06:16.245
[chuckles]

06:18.334 --> 06:19.466
We couldn't have done
the underground

06:19.509 --> 06:22.077
Mycelial travel for this part?

06:22.120 --> 06:24.906
I would have loved to,
but the Mycelium

06:24.949 --> 06:28.953
is nowhere near.
Can't travel through glaciers.

06:28.997 --> 06:32.870
[sighs] Right.

06:32.914 --> 06:35.612
[birds calling]

06:35.656 --> 06:37.179
The mouth of the cave
is up ahead.

06:42.706 --> 06:43.925
Wait.

06:47.537 --> 06:48.886
If something
goes wrong in there,

06:48.930 --> 06:50.192
I need you to promise me

06:50.235 --> 06:52.629
to get the Song
and save yourself.

06:52.673 --> 06:55.763
You're a steward.
Leave me behind if you have to.

06:55.806 --> 06:59.244
If I return with you,
your Unit will blame me.

06:59.288 --> 07:00.811
Can you imagine the wrath
they will unleash?

07:00.855 --> 07:04.119
Doesn't matter.
If what you told me is true,

07:04.162 --> 07:06.426
and the fate of this world
hangs in the balance,

07:06.469 --> 07:09.864
all that matters
is the Song. Promise me.

07:12.736 --> 07:15.391
I will.

07:15.435 --> 07:18.002
And I promise what we're doing
is for the good of all people.

07:18.046 --> 07:22.877
[sighs] You've made a lot
of promises over the years.

07:22.920 --> 07:25.357
You've disappointed me a lot.

07:25.401 --> 07:28.186
But I know as deeply
as I know anything,

07:28.230 --> 07:29.753
you're telling the truth.

07:32.539 --> 07:34.018
Onward.

07:46.596 --> 07:48.903
[indistinct chatter]

07:48.946 --> 07:52.907
Please. I need to go home
to my family.

07:52.950 --> 07:54.517
[woman] We just captured
this Army deserter.

07:54.561 --> 07:56.954
Let me help her.

07:56.998 --> 07:58.042
[grunts]

08:00.349 --> 08:01.916
[winces, groans]

08:03.308 --> 08:04.440
[whimpering, groaning]

08:06.660 --> 08:09.576
This is days old. Why didn't
the Army's Fixers look at this?

08:09.619 --> 08:10.968
There are no Fixers.

08:12.927 --> 08:14.755
-What?
-[breathes deeply]

08:14.798 --> 08:17.888
The Civilian Oversight
detained them in Fort Salem.

08:17.932 --> 08:20.151
They sent you into battle
without medics?

08:26.680 --> 08:28.290
[incanting] Ask, and it
shall be given to you.

08:28.333 --> 08:29.857
Seek, and ye shall find.

08:29.900 --> 08:31.249
Knock, and it shall
be opened unto you.

08:31.293 --> 08:32.903
Ask, and it shall be
given to you.

08:32.947 --> 08:34.470
Seek, and ye shall find.

08:34.514 --> 08:36.341
Knock, and it shall
be opened unto you.

08:42.260 --> 08:43.914
[sighs]

08:49.311 --> 08:50.965
I know you.

08:51.008 --> 08:52.880
Yeah, I'm pretty famous.

08:52.923 --> 08:56.710
No. I've seen you.

08:56.753 --> 08:58.886
In her memories.

08:58.929 --> 09:00.627
Whose memories?

09:00.670 --> 09:03.934
The soldier we detained
in Sioux Territory last week.

09:06.763 --> 09:08.896
Scylla?

09:08.939 --> 09:10.027
Do you know where she is?

09:11.768 --> 09:13.553
Start talking.

09:24.215 --> 09:25.260
[drink pouring]

09:26.783 --> 09:30.352
President Silver.
What a nice surprise.

09:30.395 --> 09:33.137
Surprise, huh.

09:33.181 --> 09:35.357
That's exactly the word
that I was looking for.

09:35.400 --> 09:37.359
[clock chiming]

09:37.402 --> 09:38.926
[spits drink, coughs]

09:40.623 --> 09:42.146
Wow, that is atrocious.

09:42.190 --> 09:43.800
I think I read
that witches have

09:43.844 --> 09:47.238
extremely unrefined
palates, sir.

09:47.282 --> 09:50.459
Well, that would make sense.

09:50.502 --> 09:52.374
You know, I have a friend who
runs a distillery in Kentucky.

09:52.417 --> 09:54.898
I'll have him send you over
a few bottles of the good stuff.

09:54.942 --> 09:58.467
That's very kind of you.
Now, what can I do for you?

09:58.510 --> 09:59.860
Because we're in the middle
of a war right now,

09:59.903 --> 10:01.122
so I'm a little busy.

10:01.165 --> 10:03.124
Are you, though? Hm.

10:03.167 --> 10:04.647
See, I mentioned the word
"surprise" earlier,

10:04.691 --> 10:07.824
because I am surprised.

10:07.868 --> 10:11.915
-How so?
-We have the most
formidable Army in the world,

10:11.959 --> 10:13.874
and yet, our troops
are behind held back

10:13.917 --> 10:17.878
by some half-assed,
taped together Cession militia.

10:17.921 --> 10:19.880
Led by Thelma Bearkiller,
who I assure you,

10:19.923 --> 10:22.404
does not do anything
half-assed.

10:22.447 --> 10:24.493
We should be crushing them!

10:27.235 --> 10:29.280
Don't you agree, Col. Jarrett?

10:29.324 --> 10:31.848
Yes, sir, 100%.

10:31.892 --> 10:34.938
Now quit slow-playing
this occupation.

10:34.982 --> 10:37.985
Break the stalemate
using any force necessary.

10:38.028 --> 10:41.553
And maybe, when I
bring in your daughter

10:41.597 --> 10:43.120
and her little friends,
I just might

10:43.164 --> 10:45.340
be inclined to be lenient.

10:45.383 --> 10:48.778
Because we will
bring them in, eventually.

10:53.914 --> 10:55.916
[exhaling deeply]

11:11.932 --> 11:14.978
[Tally scoffs] Witches were
already being hunted.

11:15.022 --> 11:17.067
The Camarilla
didn't even exist yet.

11:17.111 --> 11:19.417
Hatred has always existed.

11:19.461 --> 11:20.897
[ice shifting]

11:22.290 --> 11:24.901
We need to hurry.

11:27.077 --> 11:28.731
The Song isn't in a vessel.

11:30.254 --> 11:32.256
It's inside her.

11:32.300 --> 11:33.910
What do we do?

11:37.914 --> 11:39.307
Time to wake the witch.

11:42.092 --> 11:44.878
No one knew her name
or who she was,

11:44.921 --> 11:49.012
just that she was important.
The Commanders,

11:49.056 --> 11:51.841
they wanted any intel she had
on the Bearkiller militia.

11:51.885 --> 11:54.191
[sighs]

11:54.235 --> 11:58.021
They forced us to link with her,
to find out what we could.

11:58.065 --> 11:59.806
What did she tell you?

11:59.849 --> 12:02.722
Nothing. [sighs]

12:02.765 --> 12:05.899
She blocked her mind...

12:05.942 --> 12:07.639
with memories of you.

12:09.816 --> 12:11.905
She's at a base in New Tanasi

12:11.948 --> 12:13.733
where they
commandeered a school.

12:13.776 --> 12:17.388
They call it
the Slaughterhouse.

12:17.432 --> 12:19.434
They're determined
to break her.

12:22.002 --> 12:23.873
Clean her up.

12:23.917 --> 12:25.919
Find out everything she knows
about this base.

12:31.272 --> 12:32.490
[man murmuring indistinctly]

12:32.534 --> 12:34.797
We have to save Scylla.

12:34.841 --> 12:37.844
New Tanasi is over the line
in Army territory.

12:37.887 --> 12:39.149
I can't risk the troops.

12:39.193 --> 12:40.411
Then I'll go alone.

12:40.455 --> 12:41.848
It's a suicide mission.

12:41.891 --> 12:43.327
Begging your pardon,
Councilwoman,

12:43.371 --> 12:45.721
but those are
the missions we do best.

12:45.765 --> 12:47.723
Abs, I can't
ask you to do that.

12:47.767 --> 12:49.725
You're not asking
for anything.

12:49.769 --> 12:53.642
Scylla needs us.
She's one of us now.

12:56.384 --> 12:59.387
We'll infiltrate the base
and gather intel, as well.

12:59.430 --> 13:01.737
Look at the bright side.
If we get caught,

13:01.781 --> 13:05.741
Silver has no real reason
to continue the occupation.

13:05.785 --> 13:08.396
I suppose I couldn't
stop you if I wanted to.

13:10.311 --> 13:12.661
Get back to our lines safely.

13:20.843 --> 13:22.889
Did you call Scylla one of us?

13:22.932 --> 13:25.500
You know I've got
a soft spot for shitbirds.

13:35.379 --> 13:38.861
So, what brings
the head of Army Intelligence

13:38.905 --> 13:40.645
into the Cession?

13:40.689 --> 13:41.864
If I don't use
my vacation days

13:41.908 --> 13:44.911
by end of year,
I lose 'em.

13:44.954 --> 13:47.652
You know, that's the problem
with you Army brats.

13:47.696 --> 13:49.829
You never like
to have any fun.

13:49.872 --> 13:51.482
It's all work-work-work.

13:51.526 --> 13:54.137
Is that what you're
doing here? Having fun?

13:54.181 --> 13:56.400
'Cause it doesn't
look that way, you--

13:56.444 --> 14:00.317
You look sad.
Pathetic, actually.

14:00.361 --> 14:02.493
[laughs]

14:05.975 --> 14:08.673
The bravado!

14:08.717 --> 14:14.027
Did you think that
coming into my house

14:14.070 --> 14:18.858
and insulting my Army
was a good move?

14:18.901 --> 14:22.296
[both chuckle]

14:22.339 --> 14:24.428
You call this an Army?

14:24.472 --> 14:26.169
[Nicte]
No.

14:26.213 --> 14:28.215
[hissing]

14:37.833 --> 14:41.881
Thisis what I call an Army.

14:53.893 --> 14:55.590
Impressive.

14:55.633 --> 14:57.853
I'm gonna ask you
one more time,

14:57.897 --> 14:59.724
what are you doing here?

14:59.768 --> 15:00.943
And if you don't
have an answer,

15:00.987 --> 15:03.641
I can show you what
my Army is capable of.

15:03.685 --> 15:06.818
Abigail tells me you have
experience with the Marshal.

15:06.862 --> 15:08.995
[inhales sharply]
You could call it that.

15:09.038 --> 15:10.170
Can you track him down?

15:10.213 --> 15:12.172
It's hard enough to evade him.

15:14.609 --> 15:17.873
I assume you're looking
for President Wade.

15:17.917 --> 15:22.573
Hm? What a scoundrel
that Marshal is,

15:22.617 --> 15:24.401
taking off in
the middle of the night

15:24.445 --> 15:28.797
with such precious
U.S. cargo.

15:28.840 --> 15:29.885
Do you really think
she can stop

15:29.929 --> 15:31.147
what's brewing out there?

15:31.191 --> 15:32.192
She's our only hope.

15:32.235 --> 15:34.063
She's not a witch!

15:34.107 --> 15:35.064
She's one of them!

15:35.108 --> 15:37.501
Wade is on our side.

15:37.545 --> 15:40.591
She doesn't look like
she's on anybody's side.

15:40.635 --> 15:43.116
She's M.I.A. Gone.

15:43.159 --> 15:44.726
She could be dead,
for all you know!

15:44.769 --> 15:45.814
She's not.

15:45.857 --> 15:48.773
Then why hasn't she returned?

15:48.817 --> 15:52.560
So say you find her,
and she's alive. Then what?

15:52.603 --> 15:55.519
Hm? It all goes
back to status quo?

15:55.563 --> 15:58.914
Peace prevails, as long
as everyone stays in line

15:58.958 --> 16:00.437
and does as they're told.

16:00.481 --> 16:02.091
You have another plan?

16:02.135 --> 16:04.659
If I did,
it would not involve

16:04.702 --> 16:06.356
pinning my hopes
on a politician.

16:08.054 --> 16:09.925
The world is burning.

16:09.969 --> 16:12.188
Why not try to help
put out the fire

16:12.232 --> 16:14.974
for once in your damn life?

16:19.848 --> 16:21.502
I can offer you a tune-up.

16:23.983 --> 16:25.897
And that's the best
I can do.

16:33.775 --> 16:37.431
[door opens, closes]

16:48.920 --> 16:50.270
Their scanners will
see right through

16:50.313 --> 16:52.881
-any Invisibility Work.
-I could try a storm.

16:52.924 --> 16:55.014
No offense, but I think
Scylla would rather be rescued

16:55.057 --> 16:56.450
without a roof
collapsing on her.

16:56.493 --> 16:57.842
OK, what about the Witchbomb?

16:57.886 --> 17:00.106
Promised Tally
I wouldn't use it.

17:00.149 --> 17:01.846
Then we fight.

17:01.890 --> 17:03.544
It could be
three against 100.

17:03.587 --> 17:06.851
What choice do we have?
They have scanners,

17:06.895 --> 17:08.853
dampeners, reflective armor -
everything designed

17:08.897 --> 17:10.768
specifically
to stop our Work.

17:10.812 --> 17:13.119
What if we can distract them
without Work?

17:16.426 --> 17:18.950
[both laughing]

17:21.214 --> 17:24.304
Come swing with me! [laughs]

17:24.347 --> 17:27.916
-How about I push?
-Whoo! [chuckling]

17:31.006 --> 17:33.443
Hey, don't you kids know
that there's a curfew?

17:33.487 --> 17:35.054
[Abigail groans]
I feel sick.

17:35.097 --> 17:36.577
[both groan]

17:36.620 --> 17:40.015
Too much tequila. [groans]

17:40.059 --> 17:41.843
What are you doing out here?

17:41.886 --> 17:45.064
I'm so sorry, man. We were
coming home from a party--

17:45.107 --> 17:47.327
-Party?
-[Adil] Yeah.

17:47.370 --> 17:48.850
There's a war
going on, you know.

17:48.893 --> 17:51.679
Totally. And we're
on your side.

17:51.722 --> 17:53.550
[Commander]
Show me your papers!

17:53.594 --> 17:55.813
OK, man. Relax.

17:57.554 --> 17:59.991
[all groaning]

18:04.300 --> 18:05.736
[breathes sharply]

18:09.392 --> 18:10.393
[sighs]

18:13.918 --> 18:16.269
We need to
facilitate a transfer.

18:16.312 --> 18:18.662
A what?

18:18.706 --> 18:22.057
All stewards are able to
transfer Work between witches.

18:22.101 --> 18:24.755
It's how they can
pass their Song down.

18:24.799 --> 18:27.932
OK... How?

18:27.976 --> 18:30.805
I'm not sure.
I haven't done it myself.

18:30.848 --> 18:33.721
Maybe this will help.

18:33.764 --> 18:35.853
But I thought you said
that wasn't the First Song?

18:35.897 --> 18:37.333
-[vocalizing through box]
-But it is the Song

18:37.377 --> 18:41.381
of her family. Maybe
if she recognizes it...

18:43.861 --> 18:45.689
[vocalizing continues]

18:47.909 --> 18:49.519
[gasps] Did you see that?!

18:49.563 --> 18:50.825
[gasps, whimpers]

18:50.868 --> 18:52.043
[gasps]

18:58.485 --> 19:00.748
Tally?

19:00.791 --> 19:05.056
[filtered] It's been
dark for so long,

19:05.100 --> 19:06.797
and now, finally,

19:06.841 --> 19:09.887
I can see again.

19:11.498 --> 19:14.065
You're not Tally.

19:14.109 --> 19:15.589
Indeed.

19:15.632 --> 19:16.894
[gasps]

19:16.938 --> 19:19.680
Who are you?

19:19.723 --> 19:22.857
My name is Sarah Alder.
I am one

19:22.900 --> 19:25.816
of the Stewards
of the First Song.

19:25.860 --> 19:28.906
Of course you are.

19:28.950 --> 19:32.214
The time has come for
it to be sung again.

19:32.258 --> 19:33.824
All of us must do our part.

19:33.868 --> 19:37.306
[chuckling]

19:37.350 --> 19:40.875
Our part?

19:42.224 --> 19:46.010
Where were you centuries ago

19:46.054 --> 19:50.667
when these bastards
hunted me down

19:50.711 --> 19:52.278
for that Song?

19:52.321 --> 19:53.844
I'm sorry you had
to endure that.

19:53.888 --> 19:58.806
It has only caused pain
and persecution.

19:58.849 --> 20:00.242
We can change that.

20:00.286 --> 20:04.072
You are like them -
here to take from me.

20:04.115 --> 20:08.729
Or perhaps instead,
I'll take from you.

20:09.904 --> 20:11.035
-[Alder] Oh, no.
-[gasping]

20:11.079 --> 20:13.124
No, no, no. Tally! Tally!

20:13.168 --> 20:14.735
-[gasping]
-Tally!

20:19.827 --> 20:20.871
[sighs]

20:31.055 --> 20:34.363
I, for one, am very grateful
you didn't spill your guts

20:34.407 --> 20:36.060
to those witches.

20:36.104 --> 20:40.848
Because spilling guts
is my thing.

20:42.066 --> 20:44.373
I always wished I grew up
back in the day,

20:44.417 --> 20:48.856
when the world
was more... sensible.

20:48.899 --> 20:51.859
They'd bury your kind
up to the waist,

20:51.902 --> 20:54.209
then let the schoolboys
practice their form.

20:54.253 --> 20:55.993
[rock tumbles away]

20:56.037 --> 20:59.388
Hours of fun.
Anything you'd like to say?

21:00.476 --> 21:01.608
Let's play ball.

21:01.651 --> 21:02.652
[chuckles]

21:04.088 --> 21:06.830
Unlock her.

21:12.880 --> 21:16.057
-Or else?
-Unlock her now.

21:19.365 --> 21:22.106
[chuckles]

21:22.150 --> 21:24.587
The "now" almost
convinced me.

21:24.631 --> 21:26.328
But I don't think so.

21:26.372 --> 21:29.766
We've blocked your little
wind and whispers in here.

21:29.810 --> 21:32.160
You think you can block
the Witchbomb?

21:34.423 --> 21:36.817
You know who I am, right?

21:36.860 --> 21:39.385
'Cause your little friend
Hearst knows.

21:39.428 --> 21:43.824
And I think all your buddies
who attacked the Tarim.

21:43.867 --> 21:46.870
The mushrooms don't just
start on the skin.

21:46.914 --> 21:49.699
They form deeper.

21:49.743 --> 21:53.268
In the muscle. In the bone.

21:53.312 --> 21:56.837
You're alive as each
individual nerve is consumed.

21:56.880 --> 21:59.883
You're essentially being
eaten from the inside out.

21:59.927 --> 22:02.843
Hurts so badly, I've seen a man
claw his own belly open

22:02.886 --> 22:05.324
to try and
rip out the infection.

22:05.367 --> 22:08.283
Didn't work, but I think
it did kill him faster, right?

22:08.327 --> 22:09.850
[Scylla] Your nails don't
look sharp enough

22:09.893 --> 22:12.983
to claw into your stomach.
Maybe I'm wrong.

22:13.027 --> 22:14.898
Should we find out?

22:16.857 --> 22:18.337
I just work here.

22:23.646 --> 22:25.039
[keys jangling]

22:32.089 --> 22:33.743
No harm, no foul, all right?

22:33.787 --> 22:34.788
Good?

22:34.831 --> 22:38.661
[groaning]

22:41.403 --> 22:43.797
[grunts]

22:43.840 --> 22:45.276
[panting]

22:47.844 --> 22:48.889
[gasps]

22:50.760 --> 22:52.196
[gasps]

23:00.857 --> 23:02.555
[breathes shakily]

23:06.602 --> 23:08.604
[alarm sounding]

23:12.826 --> 23:15.089
Hold that feeling.

23:15.132 --> 23:17.178
[alarm continues]

23:22.705 --> 23:24.228
Glad to have you back,
Ramshorn.

23:24.272 --> 23:25.795
[man]
There they are!

23:25.839 --> 23:27.231
OK, let's go!

23:28.798 --> 23:32.454
Come on, Tally! Come on!

23:32.498 --> 23:36.937
[groaning, exclaiming]

23:41.811 --> 23:43.160
[exclaims]

23:45.728 --> 23:47.643
[exclaiming]

23:47.687 --> 23:49.819
[gasping]

23:49.863 --> 23:50.820
-Are you all right?
-[sighs]

23:50.864 --> 23:51.908
Are you all right?

23:51.952 --> 23:54.476
Yeah. I think so.

23:54.520 --> 23:55.651
[ice cracking]

23:58.045 --> 23:59.089
The Song, did you get it?

23:59.133 --> 24:01.831
No. We need
to get outta here.

24:01.875 --> 24:03.877
We're not leaving without it.

24:06.140 --> 24:08.447
Apprehend the fugitives!

24:10.884 --> 24:12.276
[all panting]

24:20.589 --> 24:23.853
Hold! Defensive positions!

24:29.946 --> 24:33.646
Witches of Fort Salem!
I bear you no hate.

24:33.689 --> 24:36.083
But I will not allow
an occupying force

24:36.126 --> 24:37.824
to cross this line.

24:37.867 --> 24:40.653
We're outnumbered. Fall back!

24:42.829 --> 24:47.355
Attack! That's an order.
There will be no retreat.

24:47.398 --> 24:50.967
Retreat is treason against
the United States of America!

24:51.011 --> 24:52.665
We're outnumbered!

24:52.708 --> 24:54.710
This is your final warning.

24:55.842 --> 24:58.018
-[both hissing]
-[grunting]

25:00.455 --> 25:02.196
Hold! We're in
the line of fire!

25:02.239 --> 25:05.329
-[both hiss]
-[exclaiming]

25:05.373 --> 25:06.592
[both grunt]

25:07.810 --> 25:09.159
[gasps]

25:16.863 --> 25:19.518
They're killing my soldiers.

25:19.561 --> 25:20.519
What have I done?

25:20.562 --> 25:21.911
Nothing.

25:24.566 --> 25:26.742
Just as we expected you'd do.

25:29.266 --> 25:33.009
You follow the rules,
Bellweather, always have.

25:33.053 --> 25:36.230
Partly what got you
the General's chair.

25:36.273 --> 25:38.841
You know nothing about me.

25:38.885 --> 25:43.803
Mm. I do know that after Alder,
the country was desperate

25:43.846 --> 25:45.805
for someone safe
and predictable.

25:45.848 --> 25:49.156
Someone... nonthreatening.

25:49.199 --> 25:51.071
My hands have been tied
since the moment

25:51.114 --> 25:54.204
Silver took
his Oath of Office.

25:54.248 --> 25:59.035
There are two ways people
who have their hands tied react.

25:59.079 --> 26:02.604
Some are willing
to bite off their own thumbs

26:02.648 --> 26:06.086
just to be free.
And then, there are others

26:06.129 --> 26:11.439
who sit quietly,
hands behind their backs,

26:11.482 --> 26:15.878
just waiting. Waiting
for someone to come along

26:15.922 --> 26:20.579
and undo the knot.

26:20.622 --> 26:23.190
Safe to say
you wind up solidly

26:23.233 --> 26:26.454
in the latter category, yes?

26:26.497 --> 26:27.890
Huh.

26:31.764 --> 26:35.289
[sighs]

26:35.332 --> 26:38.814
You've got me thinking
about my own Oath of Office.

26:38.858 --> 26:40.337
Powerful words.

26:40.381 --> 26:43.602
[heart beating loudly]

26:43.645 --> 26:47.910
To protect this great nation
from all enemies,

26:47.954 --> 26:50.086
foreign and domestic.

26:50.130 --> 26:52.088
-[heart beating louder]
-[Petra] Safe to say

26:52.132 --> 26:54.830
you wind up solidly
in the latter category.

26:54.874 --> 26:57.703
Yes?

26:57.746 --> 26:59.748
[heart beating faster
in time with pen]

26:59.792 --> 27:01.620
[grunting]

27:01.663 --> 27:03.360
[heart beating faster]

27:03.404 --> 27:07.147
We are the daughters
of ancient lines.

27:07.190 --> 27:10.106
[heart beating
faster, louder]

27:10.150 --> 27:14.241
We are called to greatness.

27:14.284 --> 27:18.898
-[heartbeat stops]
-[groaning]

27:38.831 --> 27:40.833
[both hiss]

27:45.838 --> 27:47.491
[exclaims]

27:50.451 --> 27:52.366
[both groaning]

27:57.632 --> 27:58.851
[both hiss, exclaim]

28:00.766 --> 28:01.897
[gasps]

28:04.552 --> 28:06.162
[hisses]

28:09.818 --> 28:11.385
[both gasp]

28:11.428 --> 28:13.779
[wind whistling]

28:13.822 --> 28:15.694
[vocalizing]

28:21.264 --> 28:23.092
[vocalizing continues]

28:27.967 --> 28:31.013
-[groans]
-It's just hail.

28:31.057 --> 28:33.320
Walk it off.

28:33.363 --> 28:34.495
[groans]

28:38.847 --> 28:40.849
[both groaning]

28:58.301 --> 29:00.956
[both gasping]

29:04.830 --> 29:07.006
[breathes deeply]

29:07.049 --> 29:11.793
My mother always said
dying in battle was an honor.

29:11.837 --> 29:13.926
But it doesn't feel
like an honor.

29:13.969 --> 29:16.798
You're not dying.

29:16.842 --> 29:18.539
It was all for nothing.

29:18.582 --> 29:20.889
-No.
-[Lupe] It was.

29:20.933 --> 29:24.414
Look around.
Where are the heroes?

29:24.458 --> 29:26.547
We need a Fixer!

29:26.590 --> 29:27.853
Hang in there.
That's an order!

29:27.896 --> 29:29.898
[breathing shakily]

29:43.520 --> 29:45.784
I'm sorry, Abs.

29:45.827 --> 29:47.263
She's already gone.

29:49.875 --> 29:53.443
When she latched onto me,
I could see her memories.

29:53.487 --> 29:55.968
There was so much pain,

29:56.011 --> 29:58.797
so much tragedy.

29:58.840 --> 30:01.321
And then in this cave,
just...

30:01.364 --> 30:03.845
endless loneliness.

30:03.889 --> 30:06.413
That's why she descended
into complete madness.

30:06.456 --> 30:08.807
[gasps]

30:08.850 --> 30:11.766
You said stewards
can transfer Work,

30:11.810 --> 30:14.116
so what if I could give her
something else to See,

30:14.160 --> 30:16.553
other than all that trauma?

30:16.597 --> 30:19.774
A trade. My Sight
for her Song.

30:19.818 --> 30:23.822
Tally. That's
a great sacrifice.

30:23.865 --> 30:29.915
[sighs] For Raelle's life?
For all our lives?

30:31.655 --> 30:32.918
What good is Sight
when there's

30:32.961 --> 30:34.615
nothing to look forward to?

30:37.052 --> 30:39.663
Besides, it might be good
for me to see

30:39.707 --> 30:42.057
what's right in front of me
for a change.

30:46.801 --> 30:48.194
[sighs]

30:53.547 --> 30:57.768
The Song has only
caused you pain.

30:57.812 --> 30:59.379
Then why keep it?

30:59.422 --> 31:01.772
With my Sight,
you won't have to exist

31:01.816 --> 31:05.254
in the darkness anymore.
You'll still be here,

31:05.298 --> 31:08.823
but you'll be able
to See the world again.

31:08.867 --> 31:14.307
See beyond.
See a future that's better.

31:22.837 --> 31:23.882
Please.

31:26.058 --> 31:29.844
[vocalizing]

31:36.895 --> 31:38.853
It worked.

31:42.509 --> 31:43.771
[gasps]

31:43.814 --> 31:46.252
[ice cracking]

31:47.644 --> 31:49.516
[both gasping]

31:51.735 --> 31:52.867
[screams]

31:54.869 --> 31:56.827
-We need to get you out.
-What about you?

31:56.871 --> 32:00.179
-Don't worry about me.
-No! You promised.

32:00.222 --> 32:04.052
I promised to protect
the stewards at all costs.

32:04.096 --> 32:05.532
You're a steward now.

32:05.575 --> 32:08.491
-But--
-[exclaims]

32:08.535 --> 32:09.579
[grunts]

32:25.726 --> 32:27.162
Is the BAT ready for take-off?

32:30.818 --> 32:33.168
[sighing]

32:33.212 --> 32:34.517
[zips bag]

32:36.215 --> 32:37.781
Where do you think
you're going?

32:37.825 --> 32:40.001
The Cession. To deal
with things directly.

32:40.045 --> 32:42.743
Absolutely not. Your orders
are to remain here.

32:42.786 --> 32:44.266
My orders were
to quit slowplaying.

32:44.310 --> 32:46.312
So, which is it?
I'm not doing enough,

32:46.355 --> 32:47.791
or I'm doing too much?

32:47.835 --> 32:49.880
Make up your mind,
Mr. President.

32:49.924 --> 32:51.491
I don't like your tone.

32:51.534 --> 32:54.102
Well, I don't like
unannounced visits.

32:54.146 --> 32:55.974
For the second time,
I might add.

32:58.324 --> 32:59.629
Where's Colonel Jarrett?

32:59.673 --> 33:01.153
-Beg your pardon?
-You heard me.

33:01.196 --> 33:03.416
I haven't seen or heard
from him in some time.

33:03.459 --> 33:05.984
That's highly unusual.
So, where is he?

33:08.464 --> 33:11.815
Ah, Mr. President.
I didn't realize

33:11.859 --> 33:13.774
you were going to grace us
with your presence today.

33:13.817 --> 33:16.907
There you are.

33:16.951 --> 33:19.301
I was just asking
General Bellweather about you.

33:19.345 --> 33:21.651
I was packing my things, sir.

33:25.786 --> 33:28.789
She's planning something.
So keep her in line,

33:28.832 --> 33:30.747
and make sure
the Occupation continues.

33:30.791 --> 33:31.835
I will, sir.

33:54.162 --> 33:55.555
Perfect timing.

33:55.598 --> 33:56.817
Yeah, good thing
he didn't stay too long.

33:56.860 --> 33:58.166
Don't think I could
have maintained

33:58.210 --> 33:59.559
that prick's face
much longer.

33:59.602 --> 34:01.256
Hopefully, you won't have to.

34:38.467 --> 34:40.513
Marshal tracked me down
when I didn't want to be found.

34:40.556 --> 34:43.037
Let's see how he likes it.

34:43.081 --> 34:44.952
-[hisses]
-[pop echoes]

34:55.919 --> 34:57.747
If Wade and the Marshal
are in the Cession,

34:57.791 --> 35:00.794
we'll find them.

35:00.837 --> 35:02.796
And when we do find them,

35:02.839 --> 35:04.841
we can start talking
about my pardon.

35:12.632 --> 35:14.112
Abs, she's awake.

35:16.810 --> 35:19.247
How did I get here?

35:19.291 --> 35:22.424
We're not really sure.
We found you in the garden,

35:22.468 --> 35:26.559
days ago, covered
in frostbite and barely alive.

35:26.602 --> 35:28.430
Couldn't string
a sentence together.

35:28.474 --> 35:30.737
And couldn't tell us
why Alder wasn't with you.

35:30.780 --> 35:33.043
[gasps]

35:33.087 --> 35:35.742
The cave collapsed.

35:35.785 --> 35:37.483
I got the Song,

35:37.526 --> 35:38.919
but Alder didn't...

35:41.574 --> 35:42.836
She didn't make it.

35:44.185 --> 35:46.753
One steward down.

35:46.796 --> 35:48.407
[breathes shakily]

35:52.454 --> 35:54.674
I think we should
turn ourselves in.

35:54.717 --> 35:56.763
-What?
-Why?

35:56.806 --> 36:00.070
Hear me out.

36:00.114 --> 36:03.030
This bloodshed has
gone on too long.

36:03.073 --> 36:06.816
How many more
Lupe Cortez's have to die?

36:06.860 --> 36:08.775
They're all here
because of us.

36:08.818 --> 36:10.777
And yes, I'm aware
that we will be

36:10.820 --> 36:13.083
put on trial
for murder and treason

36:13.127 --> 36:17.000
and... and likely
be executed.

36:17.044 --> 36:20.961
But the Cession has gone
out of her way to protect us.

36:21.004 --> 36:23.790
Isn't it time that
we returned the favor?

36:23.833 --> 36:26.140
If there's even a chance
that our surrender

36:26.184 --> 36:30.449
can provide some peace,
don't we have to try?

36:35.715 --> 36:37.020
We started this together.

36:39.501 --> 36:40.807
We should end it together.

36:43.723 --> 36:45.812
I told you, I'm not
leaving you again.

36:53.950 --> 36:55.996
[indistinct chatter]

37:05.788 --> 37:08.748
You sure you want
to go through with this?

37:08.791 --> 37:11.794
I am.

37:11.838 --> 37:13.318
Then I wish you good fortune.

37:15.842 --> 37:17.757
Wado, Bearkiller.

37:19.411 --> 37:22.283
Dodadagohvi,Bellweather.

37:30.813 --> 37:31.988
You think they'll
bother with a trial

37:32.032 --> 37:33.773
or just execute us
on the spot?

37:33.816 --> 37:35.818
If we force their hand,
they won't be able to.

37:35.862 --> 37:38.212
That's why the media's here.

37:38.256 --> 37:41.346
Your Sight's
really gone, huh?

37:41.389 --> 37:43.565
No way to see what's coming?

37:43.609 --> 37:45.828
I'm not even sure
I'd want to see this one.

37:58.101 --> 38:01.148
No rescue missions.
No jail breaks.

38:01.191 --> 38:04.325
Nothing that
makes things worse.

38:04.369 --> 38:06.719
I promise.

38:06.762 --> 38:08.721
Find Khalida.

38:08.764 --> 38:10.984
I will.

38:11.027 --> 38:14.596
And you come back to us
as soon as you can.

38:16.598 --> 38:18.948
-I love you.
-I love you, too.

38:26.129 --> 38:28.567
Hey, look at me.

38:28.610 --> 38:31.004
It's gonna be OK.

38:31.047 --> 38:34.573
You know, when my mom told me
I'd be mortal if I came back,

38:34.616 --> 38:38.490
I thought I'd be scared
or unsure. But I'm not.

38:38.533 --> 38:40.883
And I've never been more sure
of anything in my entire life.

38:40.927 --> 38:43.277
Because I have you
by my side.

38:43.321 --> 38:46.759
I just wish
there was more time.

38:46.802 --> 38:48.151
There never is.

38:48.195 --> 38:50.980
There's always something
trying to keep us apart.

38:51.024 --> 38:53.374
Then we won't let it.

38:53.418 --> 38:55.681
We won't let anything
pull us apart again.

38:55.724 --> 38:57.335
All right?

38:57.378 --> 39:02.165
If we get out of this...

39:02.209 --> 39:05.212
When we get out of this...

39:05.255 --> 39:06.822
will you marry me?

39:08.911 --> 39:11.566
[laughs]

39:11.610 --> 39:13.786
-Yes.
-Yes? Yes.

39:13.829 --> 39:15.788
[both chuckling]

39:21.837 --> 39:23.709
[chuckles]

39:23.752 --> 39:25.188
[laughs]

40:00.223 --> 40:03.749
OK, then.

40:03.792 --> 40:05.272
Heads high.

40:10.756 --> 40:11.713
[man]
Hey, they're coming out!

40:11.757 --> 40:13.193
[indistinct chatter]

40:54.321 --> 40:55.670
[camera shutters clicking]

40:55.714 --> 40:57.759
We have apprehended
the fugitives.

40:57.803 --> 41:02.329
All U.S. Army personnel
will stand down.

41:02.372 --> 41:04.026
This Occupation is over.
