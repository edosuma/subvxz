It's a sentimental idea, Saul,
always has been.

00:12.806 --> 00:14.139
That we're loyal to our people?

00:14.141 --> 00:16.742
That our people come
before the mission.

00:17.611 --> 00:19.611
Where are you going?

00:19.613 --> 00:22.280
I'm leaving.

00:22.282 --> 00:24.816
So you were just going to leave

00:24.818 --> 00:26.351
without even
saying good-bye?

00:26.353 --> 00:27.386
Take me with you.

00:27.388 --> 00:28.453
I-I can't.

It can wait.

00:52.479 --> 00:53.879
They're being overrun now.

00:53.881 --> 00:57.049
Ten minutes,

- No, no, no.

01:07.361 --> 01:08.994

Take me. Take me.

- Oh!

01:16.336 --> 01:18.370
We're getting out of Pakistan.

01:18.372 --> 01:21.540
President's decided to break
off diplomatic relations.

01:21.542 --> 01:23.942
I can't say I'm surprised.

01:23.944 --> 01:26.445
We're being evacuated in the
first wave tomorrow morning.

01:26.447 --> 01:28.346
We're handing Haqqani
Afghanistan on a platter.

01:28.348 --> 01:30.048
Fuck that!

01:30.050 --> 01:31.950
And if you're right-- if Haqqani
still is in the capital--

01:31.952 --> 01:33.585
there's no way
we get to him now.

01:33.587 --> 01:37.122

- Quinn?

01:45.232 --> 01:47.099
Yeah.

01:47.101 --> 01:49.901

03:47.949 --> 03:50.283
Really? Tell me what you did
to stop an attack

03:50.285 --> 03:52.719
that canonized a terrorist
and wiped out my entire station.

03:52.721 --> 03:54.921
It wasn't an attack.
It was a goddamn coup.

04:02.130 --> 04:03.630
You can get on a

04:05.333 --> 04:07.066

Your chief of support?

04:20.915 --> 04:24.083
I thought we were going to
have an honest conversation.

04:24.085 --> 04:26.352
Your chief of support
abducted one of our men,

04:26.354 --> 04:28.421
then burned down a bazaar.

04:28.423 --> 04:30.189
He's an assassin.

04:30.191 --> 04:32.258
My superiors have
issued a kill order.

04:32.260 --> 04:33.593
Do you understand
what that means?

04:33.595 --> 04:35.762
It's his head or mine.

04:35.764 --> 04:38.197
So don't act like I'm
not under pressure here.

04:41.770 --> 04:44.003
Okay.

04:45.006 --> 04:47.306
He's going after
Haqqani, isn't he?

04:47.308 --> 04:49.542
I don't know.

04:51.713 --> 04:53.513
Yes.

04:53.515 --> 04:55.648
So call him off.

04:55.650 --> 04:57.850
I can't. He's out on his own.

04:59.788 --> 05:03.556
Whatever happened before,
we want the same thing on this.

05:03.558 --> 05:05.625
- Which is what?
- I've got transports leaving every day.

05:05.627 --> 05:08.628
If we can find him, I'll make
sure he's on one of them.

05:10.498 --> 05:13.232
There was a moment not long ago
when you trusted me.

05:13.234 --> 05:16.335
Well, I am trusting you now,
and I'm telling you the truth.

07:17.592 --> 07:20.493
Us. We're
what's left.

07:20.495 --> 07:23.029
They've given us
lists of things to do

07:23.031 --> 07:25.364
to shut this place down,
pages and pages of items.

07:25.366 --> 07:28.601
They call it
the Failure Protocol.

07:28.603 --> 07:30.169
I don't give a shit about that.

07:30.171 --> 07:31.637
I only care about one thing.

07:31.639 --> 07:34.774
Getting us safely home.

07:34.776 --> 07:37.777
All of us,
and that includes Peter Quinn,

07:37.779 --> 07:40.313
who's out in the streets
right now I don't know where.

07:40.315 --> 07:42.148
He thinks he can find
Haissam Haqqani.

07:42.150 --> 07:44.016
He thinks he can
fix this by himself,

07:44.018 --> 07:45.952
but all he can do
is get himself killed.

07:45.954 --> 07:47.653
We need to stop him

07:47.655 --> 07:48.654
before that happens.

07:48.656 --> 07:50.223
What if he can do it?

07:50.225 --> 07:51.891
What if he can get to the
guy who did this to us?

07:51.893 --> 07:53.960
CARRIE:
He can't.

07:53.962 --> 07:56.362
He's out on his own
with no support.

07:56.364 --> 07:57.530
We could support him.

07:57.532 --> 07:59.365
CARRIE:
Max, please.

08:01.703 --> 08:02.969

09:06.034 --> 09:08.634
Your name is on the watch list.

Nothing.

Mind if I take a look?

10:55.309 --> 10:57.410
When you brought
the computers back up,

10:57.412 --> 10:59.045
you rebooted
the monitoring system.

10:59.047 --> 11:00.379
I'm still station chief.

11:00.381 --> 11:04.216

11:17.832 --> 11:20.499

I don't know.

11:26.040 --> 11:28.240

Nowhere.

11:29.877 --> 11:33.379
Max, what are you trying to do?

11:33.381 --> 11:34.814
She was a financial analyst.

11:35.550 --> 11:37.016
She did spreadsheets.

11:37.018 --> 11:39.051
And you brought her here
to this fucking place.

11:39.053 --> 11:42.088
And I told you how sorry I am.

11:42.090 --> 11:44.090
What more do you want me to say?

11:44.092 --> 11:45.524
Don't say anything.

11:45.526 --> 11:48.861
Okay. What do you want me
to do then?

11:48.863 --> 11:50.663
Bring her back.

11:52.467 --> 11:55.935
I wish I could, but I can't.

11:55.937 --> 11:57.570
Then get Haqqani.

11:57.572 --> 11:58.737
I can't do that either.

11:58.739 --> 12:01.140
Since when?
You never say that.

12:01.142 --> 12:03.075
You were in charge here,
and you survived,

12:03.077 --> 12:05.244
and now you're saying
there's nothing to do for her,

12:05.246 --> 12:06.712

12:06.714 --> 12:09.748

but I cannot lose anyone else!

Do you hear me?

I hope so, yeah.

12:59.333 --> 13:02.801
I'm looking for Peter Quinn.

13:02.803 --> 13:04.703
So you know him.

13:04.705 --> 13:06.772
Knew him.

13:06.774 --> 13:08.974
Haven't heard from
him in months.

13:08.976 --> 13:11.644
Well, if you do
hear from him...

13:11.646 --> 13:13.345
I won't.
Who are you?

13:13.347 --> 13:15.381
CARRIE:
Uh, Carrie Mathison.

13:15.383 --> 13:18.184
He's AWOL.

13:18.186 --> 13:20.052
A-WOHL?

13:20.054 --> 13:22.721
He's missing.

13:26.194 --> 13:28.460
Can I at least leave you
my contact information

13:28.462 --> 13:29.662
in case you hear anything?

13:29.664 --> 13:31.564
I said there's no point.

13:35.236 --> 13:37.369
(chuckles):
Fine.

13:37.371 --> 13:39.572
Write something.

13:50.885 --> 13:53.152
Here.

13:58.859 --> 14:00.659
You'll let me know.

14:00.661 --> 14:04.196
I won't see him, but if you do,
tell him I said to fuck himself.

14:04.198 --> 14:06.432
He'll know why.

14:15.610 --> 14:17.343
Pushy.

14:17.345 --> 14:18.777
Fucking Max.

14:18.779 --> 14:20.746
She'll be back.

14:20.748 --> 14:22.014
You find anything?

14:28.756 --> 14:31.257
The numbers you gave me--
they were already dead.

14:31.259 --> 14:33.592
So Gerhart tried
the next hundred numbers.

14:35.396 --> 14:37.429
And the next.

14:37.431 --> 14:39.665
And the next hundred.

14:42.903 --> 14:45.437
Haqqani.

14:45.439 --> 14:46.905
Where is it?

14:46.907 --> 14:48.073
Rawalpindi.

14:48.075 --> 14:49.908
Two floors,
high walls, guarded.

14:49.910 --> 14:51.210
You'll never get in.

14:51.212 --> 14:54.480
I'm gonna need your car.

14:57.618 --> 15:00.019
(car alarm chirps)

15:01.589 --> 15:03.589
So, you found me.
Congratulations.

15:03.591 --> 15:05.557
I don't think it's wrong
what you're doing.

15:05.559 --> 15:07.626
- In fact, I'm sympathetic.
- Good for you.

15:07.628 --> 15:08.994
But you have to stop.

15:08.996 --> 15:10.562
Now you're losing me.

15:10.564 --> 15:12.631
The ISI know. They know
you're still in Islamabad.

15:12.633 --> 15:13.999
There's a kill order out.

15:14.001 --> 15:15.334
I talked to Khan.

15:15.336 --> 15:16.735
Why would you do that?

15:16.737 --> 15:18.570
- To try and find you.
- So you talked

15:18.572 --> 15:20.673
to the people who just fucked us?
What is wrong with you?

15:20.675 --> 15:22.441
It's a suicide mission.

15:22.443 --> 15:23.642
That's what you say.

15:23.644 --> 15:26.045
If he's even
in Islamabad at all.

15:28.249 --> 15:30.015
You know where he is.

15:30.017 --> 15:31.483
- No.
- Quinn.

15:31.485 --> 15:33.619
- Don't.
- What?

15:33.621 --> 15:35.421
- It's too dangerous.
- Yeah, you said that.

15:35.423 --> 15:36.822
- I can't let you take that risk.
- Here's the thing.

15:36.824 --> 15:38.624
It's not up to you.
You had your chance.

15:38.626 --> 15:40.859
I was stupid enough
to listen to you the first time.

15:40.861 --> 15:42.428
I was stupid enough
to come back here

15:42.430 --> 15:44.263
when you asked me,
so I witnessed

15:44.265 --> 15:46.865
the fall of the station and
the slaughter of my colleagues.

15:46.867 --> 15:49.101
And I have never, ever
been so convinced

15:49.103 --> 15:50.703
of what has to happen now.

15:50.705 --> 15:53.639
So if you've lost your
way or your nerve,

15:53.641 --> 15:55.107
fine.

15:55.109 --> 15:57.676
What you need to do now
is get out of my way.

15:57.678 --> 16:01.246
Quinn... we lost.

16:02.016 --> 16:03.549
(door opens)

16:05.786 --> 16:07.219
Oh, great.

16:07.221 --> 16:09.488
Really, Carrie? Really?

16:09.490 --> 16:12.291
I'm sorry.

16:13.160 --> 16:15.027
All right, sir, let's go.

16:20.568 --> 16:22.634

16:26.674 --> 16:27.973
Quinn...

16:27.975 --> 16:31.543
For once in your life,
you need to listen!

16:34.682 --> 16:36.582
Fuck.

16:36.584 --> 16:39.551
(groaning, panting)

16:45.426 --> 16:48.026
Okay. Go easy.
Go easy.

16:48.028 --> 16:48.994
Get the leg.

16:48.996 --> 16:51.230
(groaning)

16:55.336 --> 16:56.835
Gunshot wound
to the right thigh.

16:56.837 --> 16:58.537
MAN: - What caliber?
- Nine millimeter.

16:58.539 --> 16:59.405
How close?

Point blank.

17:00.674 --> 17:02.241

17:02.243 --> 17:04.576

- Get the IV ready.

All right, sir,

Okay. Let's get an IV started.

Then we lost him again.

But you did the right thing
telling me where he was.

17:28.402 --> 17:30.602
She said she needs
to talk to you.

She wants you to call her.

29:20.747 --> 29:22.580
And a year. And two years.

29:22.582 --> 29:25.750
Christmas of 2008, we drank
the bar of a small hotel

29:25.752 --> 29:27.152
in Copenhagen completely dry,

29:27.154 --> 29:31.122
just the two of us,
toasting his retirement.

29:31.124 --> 29:32.891
He will never get out.

29:32.893 --> 29:36.161
But every so often, it makes him
feel better to say he will.

29:36.163 --> 29:38.263
And then he goes back
to doing what he does best.

29:38.265 --> 29:40.165
So please.

29:41.635 --> 29:44.869
How's he gonna do it?

29:47.474 --> 29:49.474
He didn't say.

29:49.476 --> 29:51.109
Right.

29:51.111 --> 29:52.911
You know everything but that.

29:52.913 --> 29:54.913
(knocking)

29:54.915 --> 29:57.148
That's for me.

30:02.622 --> 30:04.656
Hi.

30:04.658 --> 30:06.358
(talking quietly)

30:06.360 --> 30:10.428
What are these?
Jesus Christ.

30:10.430 --> 30:12.030
(sighs)

30:17.804 --> 30:20.205
- You broke into my car.
- Yeah, you want to explain

30:20.207 --> 30:22.474
empty boxes of nine-volt
batteries and these?

30:22.476 --> 30:25.310
I'm an official of
the German diplomatic mission...

30:25.312 --> 30:28.646
They smell of almonds.
That's C-4.

30:28.648 --> 30:31.750
You helped him build
a fucking bomb.

30:34.287 --> 30:37.188
Where is he?

30:37.190 --> 30:39.357
I don't know.

30:39.359 --> 30:41.126
You're lying.

30:41.128 --> 30:43.995
You know, he thought you'd have
more faith in him than this.

30:43.997 --> 30:46.531
Now please get the fuck out

30:46.533 --> 30:49.367
of my apartment
before I call my security team.

33:24.291 --> 33:25.857
Of Haqqani

Who is?

It was posted from the medical

It's not medical students.

34:01.194 --> 34:02.193
It's Quinn.

34:02.195 --> 34:03.428
What?

34:03.430 --> 34:05.196
He's trying
to flush Haqqani out.

34:05.198 --> 34:06.898
Why?

34:06.900 --> 34:09.067
Because he can't get in.

34:09.069 --> 34:12.070
Uh, there's-there's
a call to action

34:12.072 --> 34:15.239

to get rid of them.

34:43.902 --> 34:45.803
So our mission is what?

34:45.804 --> 34:48.273
- Establish a presence but hang back.
- The last thing we want

34:48.275 --> 34:50.875
is for this to look like
a government crackdown.

34:50.877 --> 34:54.145
Let our pro-Haqqani
demonstrators do what they can

34:54.147 --> 34:55.545
to clear the area first.

34:55.547 --> 34:58.549
Then mop up, if necessary.

he's still at large?

35:20.440 --> 35:22.307
We'll get him.
