00:01.501 --> 00:02.068
This is the Evergreen

00:02.068 --> 00:03.603
This is the
Evergreen forest.

00:03.603 --> 00:05.872
Quiet, peaceful, serene.

00:07.807 --> 00:10.143
That is, until
Bert Raccoon wakes up.

00:10.143 --> 00:11.778
Bert Raccoon: Yahoooo!

00:13.313 --> 00:15.148
Yeeeehaaaa!

00:16.216 --> 00:17.250
Yikes!

00:18.084 --> 00:19.085
Yaaaah...

00:22.122 --> 00:23.390
Yeaaaah!

00:23.390 --> 00:26.493
Luckily, he has some
good friends to help him out.

00:33.733 --> 00:36.302
Life would be simple
in the forest except for...

00:37.771 --> 00:38.972
Cyril Sneer!

00:42.575 --> 00:44.978
And his life would be simple
except for...

00:45.779 --> 00:47.480
the Raccoons!!

00:47.480 --> 00:49.749
♪ (show theme music) ♪

01:01.227 --> 01:03.930
When a businessman
arrives in the Evergreen Forest

01:03.930 --> 01:05.999
looking to make a big deal,

01:05.999 --> 01:09.636
there is one person he can
always count on meeting.

01:09.636 --> 01:11.771
Cyril Sneer. But today,

01:11.771 --> 01:14.641
Cyril finds himself with a
little competition.

01:14.641 --> 01:17.844
Knox?!
But JD, we don't need him!

01:17.844 --> 01:21.347
Perhaps, but there's nothing
like a little competition

01:21.347 --> 01:23.483
to get the best deal in town.

01:23.483 --> 01:25.385
We'll wait for Mr Knox.

01:25.385 --> 01:28.521
Why wait? We can
cut a deal right this minute.

01:28.521 --> 01:32.425
And in 5 minutes, be cutting
into a couple of sirloin steaks!

01:32.425 --> 01:34.294
Steaks, you said?

01:34.294 --> 01:38.398
Yes, with baked
potatoes, gravy and...

01:38.398 --> 01:43.036
...sour dough rolls?
Ohh yes! Yes!!

01:43.036 --> 01:44.370
Hmmm...

01:44.370 --> 01:46.473
You heard the man!
Let's roll!

01:46.473 --> 01:47.507
Mr Knox: What the..?!

01:48.908 --> 01:50.677
Move it, you meatheads!!

01:50.677 --> 01:52.612
Mr Knox: Greetings, JD!

01:52.612 --> 01:56.883
So kind of y'all to
wait for me, Mr Sneer.

01:57.684 --> 02:01.321
Nothing personal, Knox.
It's just business.

02:01.321 --> 02:04.491
Well, thanks to
our late arrival,

02:04.491 --> 02:06.860
there's going to be
trouble getting a table!

02:06.860 --> 02:09.028
Mr Knox: Might I suggest we dine

02:09.028 --> 02:11.564
at my new private club,

02:11.564 --> 02:13.466
Loch Links?

02:13.466 --> 02:15.735
Well then,
we could eat right away!

02:16.970 --> 02:18.371
Hmmmm...

02:18.371 --> 02:20.740
I can almost smell the food!

02:21.975 --> 02:24.978
I smell something too,
and it's a bit fishy.

02:27.413 --> 02:31.784
Ohh, your club
is marvelous, Mr Knox!

02:31.784 --> 02:34.287
Mr Knox:
Every important tycoon in town

02:34.287 --> 02:36.089
belongs to this club.

02:36.089 --> 02:39.125
I take it you are
member too, Mr Sneer?

02:39.125 --> 02:42.228
Ohh no. This place is
nothing but a takeout joint.

02:43.463 --> 02:46.332
I'm so sorry, Mr Knox.

02:46.332 --> 02:49.102
You are allowed but one guest.

02:49.102 --> 02:51.905
Mr Knox: Oh, yes, I forgot.

02:51.905 --> 02:55.775
Uh, JD, please just go on ahead.

02:55.775 --> 02:57.744
Hey, what's going on here?

02:57.744 --> 03:00.113
Do you have any idea
who you're throwing out?

03:00.113 --> 03:02.949
A very loud, pink man.

03:02.949 --> 03:06.152
Knox, you're
stealing my business deal!

03:06.152 --> 03:08.521
Mr Knox:
And many more, I expect,

03:08.521 --> 03:11.257
'cause as long as
I'm in the club,

03:11.257 --> 03:13.693
you are out of luck, Sir.

03:14.027 --> 03:15.261
Owwww!

03:15.261 --> 03:18.598
Mr Knox: Nothing personal
though. It's just business.

03:22.135 --> 03:23.636
Donna's just about the coolest,

03:23.636 --> 03:25.872
most sophisticated
person I know.

03:25.872 --> 03:28.107
Why, everyone at school
wants to hang out with her,

03:28.107 --> 03:30.710
but she's coming to see me,

03:30.710 --> 03:32.912
and her train will be here
in less than an hour.

03:32.912 --> 03:34.514
Oh, that's great, Lisa.

03:35.148 --> 03:37.584
Uh say, where did you guys
get all this old stuff?

03:37.584 --> 03:40.086
From my Pop. He said,
some of this stuff came

03:40.086 --> 03:42.956
from a clubhouse he belonged
to when he was a kid.

03:42.956 --> 03:46.192
They called themselves
The Young Tycoons.

03:46.192 --> 03:48.695
Hey, look, this must
have been theirs.

03:48.695 --> 03:50.830
What a gorgeous color.

03:50.830 --> 03:53.333
It's just what you need to
brighten this place up.

03:53.333 --> 03:54.934
Wouldn't it look great here?

03:54.934 --> 03:56.536
FORE!
What the...?

03:56.536 --> 03:58.972
Huh?!

03:58.972 --> 04:01.808
What was that?
It looked like a ball.

04:01.808 --> 04:03.876
Come on, let's
find out what's going on!

04:07.247 --> 04:08.648
A golf course?!

04:08.648 --> 04:10.650
This must be part
of that new Country Club

04:10.650 --> 04:12.485
I heard Pop talking about.

04:12.485 --> 04:14.053
Hey, maybe they'll let us

04:14.053 --> 04:16.122
shoot a couple 'a
holes sometime.

04:16.122 --> 04:18.725
Private property!!
Get out of here kid!
Bert/Cedric: Uaaaah!

04:19.759 --> 04:21.894
I wouldn't
count on it, Bert.

04:23.496 --> 04:26.666
Joining this club
is a great idea, boss.

04:26.666 --> 04:28.234
Great? It's brilliant!

04:28.234 --> 04:30.703
And once I'm in,
Knox will have no way

04:30.703 --> 04:33.072
of nabbing anymore
of my customers!

04:33.072 --> 04:35.108
Good luck with
the interview, boss.

04:35.108 --> 04:39.045
Luck?! I don't
need luck. I'm rich.

04:39.045 --> 04:41.414
Sit down, Mr Sneer!!

04:41.414 --> 04:44.083
And we shall begin
our investigation.

04:44.083 --> 04:45.518
Investigation?!

04:45.518 --> 04:48.888
I just
want to join your club.

04:48.888 --> 04:51.090
Mr Sneer!

04:51.090 --> 04:53.626
There are procedures to follow.

04:53.626 --> 04:57.263
All new members must
follow our rules

04:57.263 --> 05:00.066
and perform an initiation rite.

05:00.066 --> 05:03.102
So, there's no chance for
that card 'til this afternoon?

05:03.102 --> 05:06.306
We need to know all
about you, Mr Sneer.

05:06.306 --> 05:08.941
Who are your friends?
What schools did you attend?

05:08.941 --> 05:12.245
Are you a winner,
or are you a loser?

05:14.580 --> 05:16.249
I can't
believe those guys!

05:16.249 --> 05:19.552
First they fire a golf ball
into our clubhouse window,

05:19.552 --> 05:21.788
and then they
nearly run us down!

05:21.788 --> 05:23.323
What's wrong with them?!

05:23.323 --> 05:25.591
Maybe we just
caught them at a bad time.

05:25.591 --> 05:27.694
Time! What
time is it, Cedric?

05:27.694 --> 05:30.463
Donna's train is
gonna be here any minute.

05:30.463 --> 05:33.166
I gotta go!
See you, Lisa!

05:33.166 --> 05:36.135
Come on, Bert.
Can't we just forget about

05:36.135 --> 05:38.004
those guys at the golf course?

05:38.004 --> 05:39.572
No, we can't.

05:39.572 --> 05:41.374
Listen to this!

05:41.374 --> 05:43.976
Attention occupants,

05:43.976 --> 05:46.612
Loch Links Golf and Country Club

05:46.612 --> 05:49.949
wish to inform you that
your primitive clubhouse

05:49.949 --> 05:52.518
has been deemed an eyesore.

05:52.518 --> 05:55.154
We demand
removal of this shack,

05:55.154 --> 05:58.257
or further action
shall be taken.

05:58.257 --> 06:01.394
They want us to
tear down our clubhouse!

06:02.562 --> 06:05.798
Mr Sneer, we have
reached a decision.

06:05.798 --> 06:08.134
We believe you have
the qualifications

06:08.134 --> 06:10.536
that we require at Loch Links.

06:10.536 --> 06:13.573
Great! I'm in!
This will show Knox!

06:14.874 --> 06:17.143
Sit down, Mr Sneer!

06:17.143 --> 06:18.878
You're not in the club yet.

06:18.878 --> 06:21.914
Ohh, forgot my
initiation rites, huh?

06:21.914 --> 06:25.485
Your initiation rights
are a long way off.

06:25.485 --> 06:29.389
Loch Links is full, but
we have a waiting list

06:29.389 --> 06:31.724
and you are on it now.

06:31.724 --> 06:34.994
A waiting list?
How long do I have to wait?

06:34.994 --> 06:36.562
Just five years.

06:36.562 --> 06:39.232
Five years?
- Maybe six.

06:39.232 --> 06:41.167
No one's ever really sure.

06:42.535 --> 06:44.971
They can't tear
down our clubhouse!

06:44.971 --> 06:47.373
Wait, we're not
even on their land!

06:47.373 --> 06:50.643
You're right, Bert.
But we can fix it up a bit.

06:50.643 --> 06:53.413
After all, they're
our neighbors now

06:53.413 --> 06:55.381
and we should try to get along.

06:55.381 --> 06:57.250
Yeah, I
guess you're right.

06:58.317 --> 07:01.687
With a little work we could
spruce this place up in no time,

07:01.687 --> 07:04.524
but we better be careful,
or those stuffed shirts

07:04.524 --> 07:06.726
at Loch Links will be over here,

07:06.726 --> 07:08.728
wanting to join our club!

07:08.728 --> 07:10.830
Bert/Cedric:

07:10.830 --> 07:12.265
That's the spirit, Bert.

07:12.265 --> 07:14.867
Yeah, I'll stick
up that door knocker.

07:14.867 --> 07:17.003
Eh! Hey, where is it?

07:17.003 --> 07:19.605
I think,
Lisa had it last.

07:19.605 --> 07:21.040
I'll go and ask
her if she's seen it.

07:24.377 --> 07:26.245
Come in!

07:26.245 --> 07:30.783
Hi George. Hard at work
on another perfect pecan pie?

07:30.783 --> 07:33.753
No, not exactly, Bert.

07:33.753 --> 07:37.356
Ohh, a luxurious
lime mousse!

07:37.356 --> 07:39.392
I'm cleaning the oven!

07:39.859 --> 07:41.194
Ohh.

07:41.194 --> 07:44.730
Um, em, is Lisa around?

07:44.730 --> 07:46.132
She's
upstairs with Donna.

07:46.132 --> 07:47.133
Thanks!

07:49.769 --> 07:52.905
Lisa? Sorry to bother
you, but I'm looking

07:52.905 --> 07:54.740
for that door knocker and, um...

07:55.641 --> 07:56.943
Bert?

07:56.943 --> 07:57.977
Lisa?

08:00.780 --> 08:03.416
So, this is Bert Raccoon?

08:03.416 --> 08:05.751
Yes. Um, oh,
Bert, this is Donna,

08:05.751 --> 08:07.453
a friend from my old school.

08:07.453 --> 08:08.988
Uh, hi, Donna.

08:08.988 --> 08:11.023
Lisa, when did
you start smoking?

08:11.023 --> 08:12.758
Bert, you've
seen me smoking before.

08:12.758 --> 08:15.495
I've been smoking since.. um...

08:15.495 --> 08:17.363
I started months ago.

08:17.363 --> 08:19.432
Everybody I know, smokes.

08:19.432 --> 08:21.634
Yeah, that's about
when I started, too.

08:23.503 --> 08:25.071
Uh, Bert, did
you want something?

08:25.071 --> 08:28.908
Yeah, I-I was looking
for that door knocker.

08:28.908 --> 08:30.676
Ohh yeah, I've
got it right here.

08:30.676 --> 08:31.944
Light?

08:35.515 --> 08:37.250
You know, these
things can kill ya'!

08:39.252 --> 08:41.487
(coughing) Hey!

08:41.487 --> 08:42.522
Here, Bert.

08:42.522 --> 08:44.857
Oh, that's the
most disgusting color

08:44.857 --> 08:47.693
I've ever seen. Yucko pink!

08:49.295 --> 08:51.464
Yeah... yucko pink.

08:51.464 --> 08:53.533
If you'll excuse me...

08:54.200 --> 08:56.302
I'll see you out.
Wait, Bert!

08:56.302 --> 08:59.038
What's going on here,
Lisa? You never smoked before!

08:59.038 --> 09:01.007
I don't need a
lecture, Bert Raccoon!!

09:01.007 --> 09:02.475
Hey, Lisa?

09:02.475 --> 09:04.977
Lisa, is something
burning up there?

09:06.846 --> 09:09.849
Honey, could you check and see
if I turned off the iron?

09:11.017 --> 09:12.518
Uh, sure, dad.

09:12.518 --> 09:14.687
Bert, promise me you won't tell.

09:17.823 --> 09:21.027
I know you're just the
secretary at Lock Links,

09:21.027 --> 09:24.363
but if you were to shovel
things around a bit,

09:24.363 --> 09:26.232
I'm sure we could find a way to

09:26.232 --> 09:28.434
get me into that club of yours.

09:28.434 --> 09:30.670
I've got a pile of paper here,

09:30.670 --> 09:32.638
10's and 20's, actually.

09:32.638 --> 09:34.173
That might, um...

09:34.173 --> 09:36.876
Hello? Hello?

09:36.876 --> 09:39.845
Heck! I don't know if
I want to belong to a club

09:39.845 --> 09:41.647
that won't even take a bribe!

09:41.647 --> 09:43.349
There's got to be
another way in!

09:43.349 --> 09:44.617
There is boss.

09:44.617 --> 09:49.555
The Lock Links Open is the
highlight of our golf season.

09:49.555 --> 09:53.626
This annual Fall Classic
is open to all club members

09:53.626 --> 09:56.195
and the general public.
So what?!

09:56.195 --> 09:59.765
First prize is a one year
membership at Lock Links.

09:59.765 --> 10:02.068
Pig 2: So what?!
The boss doesn't golf!

10:02.068 --> 10:03.769
Doesn't golf? Ha!

10:03.769 --> 10:07.039
There was a time I practically
lived on a golf course.

10:07.039 --> 10:09.308
Whack! Look out, Knox!

10:13.279 --> 10:15.081
So this person...

10:15.081 --> 10:17.249
But I can't say who it is,

10:17.249 --> 10:18.784
...is doing something,

10:18.784 --> 10:20.786
But it's not very smart,

10:20.786 --> 10:22.088
And you can't say why?

10:22.088 --> 10:24.023
Right!
Right.

10:24.023 --> 10:26.125
So what should I do?

10:26.125 --> 10:28.294
Bert, it sounds like
this person's problem

10:28.294 --> 10:30.763
is something they're going to
have to solve on their own.

10:30.763 --> 10:33.366
You'll just have
to trust your friend.

10:33.366 --> 10:36.802
Trust, huh?
Yeah, I suppose you're right.

10:36.802 --> 10:39.605
Hey, listen, guys,
don't tell anyone I was

10:39.605 --> 10:41.741
talking to you about this, okay?

10:41.741 --> 10:44.310
Talking about what?

10:45.311 --> 10:47.647
That's good, Ralph. See ya'!

10:47.647 --> 10:49.315
Hi, Bert.
Huh?

10:49.315 --> 10:50.683
What are you doing here?

10:50.683 --> 10:53.653
Well, I kind
of need a favor.

10:53.653 --> 10:56.656
I'm going back with Donna on the
train in a couple of days

10:56.656 --> 10:59.492
for a visit, but I have
to pay my own way.

10:59.959 --> 11:02.762
Could I do your paper route?
Sure!

11:02.762 --> 11:04.697
This way I could spend more time

11:04.697 --> 11:06.332
fixing up the clubhouse.

11:06.332 --> 11:08.834
Thanks, Bert.
You're a real friend.

11:08.834 --> 11:10.636
Ah, don't mention it.

11:10.636 --> 11:12.838
See you later.
Bye, Bert.

11:15.641 --> 11:18.277
Great, you
found the old sticks!

11:18.277 --> 11:20.646
Pig 1: Um, boss, don't
you think you should

11:20.646 --> 11:22.481
get a new set of clubs?

11:22.481 --> 11:24.884
These clubs
are very dear to me.

11:24.884 --> 11:26.919
Played my first game with them.

11:30.256 --> 11:32.458
Knock it
right out of sight!

11:35.361 --> 11:37.463
Uh, the boss is hopeless.

11:37.463 --> 11:39.598
If he's gonna
win that tournament,

11:39.598 --> 11:41.701
we're gonna have
to do it for him.

11:43.169 --> 11:45.604
This is so boring!

11:45.604 --> 11:47.406
How much more do we have to do?

11:47.406 --> 11:49.008
We're almost done.

11:49.008 --> 11:52.778
Oh, great. We're down
to our last cigarettes too!

11:52.778 --> 11:56.849
Please tell me there's a store
somewhere in all these trees.

11:56.849 --> 11:58.884
Of course there is.

11:58.884 --> 12:00.453
Good. I'm
going to head back.

12:00.453 --> 12:02.488
Could you pick up
a new deck for me?

12:02.488 --> 12:03.989
Uh, what?

12:03.989 --> 12:05.991
You know, another
pack of cigarettes?

12:05.991 --> 12:07.960
Ohh yeah, sure.

12:07.960 --> 12:09.028
Here's the money.

12:10.930 --> 12:12.965
You know, when we
get back to the city,

12:12.965 --> 12:16.035
you're going to
really fit
right in. See you
later!

Oh, hi, Bert!

13:41.120 --> 13:43.389
I thought you were going
to work on the clubhouse?

13:43.389 --> 13:45.825
Yeah, and I
thought you were broke.

13:45.825 --> 13:48.127
You didn't need
money for the train.

13:48.127 --> 13:50.496
You needed it for cigarettes!

13:50.496 --> 13:52.765
And I trusted you, Lisa!

13:52.765 --> 13:56.435
Wait! Bert, come back!
Let me explain!

14:02.842 --> 14:06.412
Uh, wow! Look at that shot!

14:06.412 --> 14:09.448
Not bad, if you like
long, straight drives.

14:09.448 --> 14:12.418
Pig 2: And he's not
even the favorite to win.

14:12.418 --> 14:14.086
Mr Knox: That's right, boys.

14:14.086 --> 14:15.988
But I am!

14:15.988 --> 14:18.324
Great, Knox.
Now take off!

14:18.324 --> 14:20.626
Mr Knox: Why, Cyril...

14:20.626 --> 14:24.029
Is that any way to speak
to your golf partner?

14:24.029 --> 14:26.532
Partner?!
Mr Knox: That's right, Mr Sneer!

14:26.532 --> 14:29.535
And I believe, I'm up first.

14:29.535 --> 14:32.972
Membership does
have its advantages!

14:32.972 --> 14:34.406
Now, see here, Knox!

14:34.406 --> 14:37.543
I've had enough of your gum
flapping to last me a lifetime!

14:37.543 --> 14:41.447
Pig 3: Gee, the boss
is really losing control.

14:41.447 --> 14:44.283
Pig 2: But it doesn't matter,
because we're in control.

14:44.283 --> 14:46.352
Remote control!

14:46.352 --> 14:50.656
With this little baby, we can
guide the boss's golf ball

14:50.656 --> 14:52.291
all over the course!

14:56.528 --> 15:00.699
Mr Knox: I know how much you
enjoy getting a bargain.

15:00.699 --> 15:03.369
So, watch me closely today

15:03.369 --> 15:06.906
and you'll be getting
a free golf lesson!

15:10.042 --> 15:11.810
Huh!
Yikes!

15:13.345 --> 15:14.513
Awwww!

15:14.513 --> 15:18.484
Mr Knox:
Most unfortunate, Mr Sneer.

15:22.588 --> 15:25.224
Get that
membership ready, Knox!

15:27.226 --> 15:29.094
Hello?
Is anybody home?

15:29.094 --> 15:31.563
This place is
weird. Can we go?

15:31.563 --> 15:33.866
I have to give Bert
his newspaper bag back.

15:33.866 --> 15:35.200
Oh, just leave it.

15:35.200 --> 15:37.102
Our train will be here
in a couple of hours,

15:37.102 --> 15:38.871
and we still got
to pack, you know.

15:38.871 --> 15:41.674
Look, I must talk
to Bert before we go!

15:41.674 --> 15:44.109
Fine! You can
wait around all you want,

15:44.109 --> 15:46.111
but I'm going!

15:49.848 --> 15:52.918
This gizmo's
really doing the job!

15:52.918 --> 15:55.421
The boss is the course leader.

15:55.421 --> 15:57.756
Pig 1: Ohh, what style!
What form!

15:57.756 --> 16:00.726
What? What...

16:00.726 --> 16:02.161
Food?!

16:02.161 --> 16:03.862
Wooohooo!

16:06.031 --> 16:08.767
Pig 2: This little piggie
has roast beef!
Pig 3: Don't be a hog!

16:09.702 --> 16:10.669
Pig 1: Whoops!

16:12.304 --> 16:15.274
Uh-oh! It's ruined!

16:15.274 --> 16:16.742
Oi!

16:18.344 --> 16:19.545
Oiii!

16:19.545 --> 16:22.214
Pig 2: And so is
the boss's golf game!

16:25.584 --> 16:28.587
He-he, well, at
least it had good speed.

16:28.587 --> 16:30.089
Mr Knox:

16:34.994 --> 16:39.264
Seems, your game is
falling apart, Mr Sneer.

16:42.067 --> 16:45.070
Wait'll we show the
guys all the balls we found!

16:45.070 --> 16:46.071
Bert?

16:47.573 --> 16:48.974
Hey, neat!

16:49.742 --> 16:51.510
Got a match?

16:54.113 --> 16:56.815
Bentley Raccoon!
Uh... Lisa!

16:56.815 --> 17:00.019
Take that thing out of
your mouth right now, Buster!

17:00.019 --> 17:02.421
Hey, I was
only fooling around.

17:02.421 --> 17:04.256
You don't fool
around with cigarettes!

17:04.256 --> 17:06.325
Do you have any idea what
they can do to your health?

17:06.325 --> 17:09.595
You can't breathe! They smell
awful! They're expensive!

17:09.595 --> 17:11.030
And once you start smoking,

17:11.030 --> 17:13.432
it's almost impossible to stop!

17:13.432 --> 17:15.701
Bentley, cigarettes
are not cool!

17:15.701 --> 17:17.302
I know
that stuff already.

17:17.302 --> 17:19.772
And you know,
that I don't smoke!

17:20.472 --> 17:23.375
Brother! Sisters can be so dumb!

17:23.375 --> 17:26.345
Hey, what's the
problem with Bentley?

17:26.345 --> 17:30.049
Me! I just gave him
the full lecture on smoking!

17:30.049 --> 17:31.950
Oh, Bert, I've been so stupid!

17:31.950 --> 17:34.420
I don't want Bentley
to ever start smoking!

17:34.420 --> 17:36.321
I'm finished with those things.

17:36.321 --> 17:38.390
Hey, that's great!

17:38.390 --> 17:40.526
I just hope
Donna thinks so, too.

17:41.460 --> 17:43.162
Mr Knox: One...

17:43.162 --> 17:44.530
Two...

17:44.530 --> 17:47.666
Ha! Three strokes, Mr Sneer!

17:47.666 --> 17:49.201
I can count, Knox!

17:49.201 --> 17:51.003
Mr Knox: Y'all
don't have a chance

17:51.003 --> 17:52.738
of winning that membership.

17:52.738 --> 17:54.073
You think so, eh?

17:54.073 --> 17:56.975
Mr Knox: Uh huh, and frankly,

17:56.975 --> 18:00.813
some people just don't
belong in a club like this.

18:00.813 --> 18:04.917
I mean, look at that
ridiculous golf bag

18:04.917 --> 18:07.186
and those antique clubs.

18:07.186 --> 18:10.656
This really isn't the
place for.. uh, heh...

18:10.656 --> 18:12.191
...your type.

18:13.392 --> 18:16.095
Why, of all the pompous
high-falutin arrogance!

18:16.095 --> 18:19.598
It's time someone knocked that
knucklehead off his high horse!

18:19.598 --> 18:21.533
A Sneer may be down,

18:21.533 --> 18:23.202
but never count him out.

18:30.642 --> 18:33.545
Yahooo!

18:38.584 --> 18:41.386
Mr Knox: Well, you made a
remarkable comeback, Sir,

18:41.386 --> 18:44.690
but I'm afraid it's not enough.

18:44.690 --> 18:48.927
I sink this and I win!

18:51.463 --> 18:52.731
Ohh...

18:54.299 --> 18:57.970
Mr Knox: I don't wish to put
any undue pressure on you,

18:57.970 --> 19:01.440
but.. uhh, if y'all
want that membership,

19:01.440 --> 19:04.376
you better make this putt!

19:08.647 --> 19:10.883
Thanks for the pep talk, Knox!

19:12.484 --> 19:14.286
Mr Knox:
Congratulations, Mr Sneer.

19:14.286 --> 19:17.456
The Board of Directors asked
me to give this to you.

19:17.456 --> 19:19.458
Ahah, my membership?

19:19.458 --> 19:21.960
Mr Knox: Heh! Not exactly.

19:21.960 --> 19:24.596
It's your initiation rites.

19:24.596 --> 19:27.132
Just a silly tradition, really.

19:29.134 --> 19:31.470
Silly?!
This is downright juvenile.

19:31.470 --> 19:33.272
Knock down some old shack.

19:34.006 --> 19:36.074
Oh well, in 5 minutes
I'll be knocking back

19:36.074 --> 19:37.943
a victory soda in
the members lounge.

19:39.745 --> 19:41.180
This must be it.

19:41.180 --> 19:44.049
A couple of quick swings
and this place is kindling.

19:45.751 --> 19:48.687
Hey, my old door knocker!

19:49.254 --> 19:51.957
This is Cedric's clubhouse,

19:51.957 --> 19:54.359
and they want me
to knock it down?!

19:54.359 --> 19:56.161
Not a chance!

19:58.530 --> 19:59.665
Eh-ehm.

19:59.665 --> 20:01.366
Something wrong kid?

20:01.366 --> 20:03.135
Ohh, Mr Sneer!

20:03.702 --> 20:06.205
I guess, this looks
weird to you, huh?

20:06.205 --> 20:10.309
No, I've done
this before... with cigars.

20:10.309 --> 20:13.712
You know, they don't break
nearly as nicely, but

20:13.712 --> 20:15.480
they're just as hard to quit.

20:15.480 --> 20:17.382
Oh, I've already quit.

20:17.382 --> 20:20.152
Great, but why the tears?

20:20.152 --> 20:23.455
I'd be hilariously
happy if I could quit.

20:23.455 --> 20:25.624
But your friends
wouldn't dump you if you did.

20:25.624 --> 20:27.626
I just lost a friend.

20:27.626 --> 20:30.028
She said I wouldn't
fit in with her crowd.

20:30.662 --> 20:34.700
Listen kid, some crowds
just are not worth belonging to.

20:34.700 --> 20:37.202
Yeah, but
I wanted to belong.

20:39.404 --> 20:42.574
Crowds, clubs,
it's all the same deal.

20:42.574 --> 20:45.644
You do what they want,
they let you join up.

20:45.644 --> 20:47.746
Pretty soon,
you're just like them.

20:47.746 --> 20:50.682
I was almost a
Loch Links lemming.

20:50.682 --> 20:52.684
You don't want to be
one of those, do you?

20:53.318 --> 20:55.687
I guess not.
Dare to be different!

20:55.687 --> 20:57.990
And never mind what
the crowd thinks,

20:57.990 --> 21:00.659
because as long as they're
talking about you,

21:00.659 --> 21:02.427
they'll never forget about you!

21:03.095 --> 21:04.763
I guess, you're right.

21:04.763 --> 21:07.499
You know, Mr Sneer,
you're a lot different

21:07.499 --> 21:09.101
than what people had told me.

21:09.101 --> 21:10.769
You're okay!

21:10.769 --> 21:12.838
What people?
What did they say?

21:12.838 --> 21:15.240
Were there three of them?
Short little fat guys

21:15.240 --> 21:17.175
with flat noses
and squeaky voices?

21:18.410 --> 21:20.279
This is quite a privilege

21:20.279 --> 21:22.581
being allowed to put
the first stroke

21:22.581 --> 21:24.716
of new paint on your clubhouse.

21:24.716 --> 21:27.119
Well, it was the
least we could do, Pop.

21:27.119 --> 21:28.353
You bought us the paint.

21:28.353 --> 21:30.355
I just wanted this
clubhouse of yours

21:30.355 --> 21:33.091
to really stand out.
But I've got to say,

21:33.091 --> 21:35.627
this is an interesting
color you've picked out.

21:35.627 --> 21:38.297
Lisa picked it out.
It's called...

21:38.297 --> 21:39.698
Lisa/Bert: ...yucko pink!
