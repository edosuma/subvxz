WEBVTT

00:00.375 --> 00:03.458
I gotta get goin'

00:03.458 --> 00:07.250
a friend of mine

00:08.875 --> 00:11.125
he's just Pooh Bear

00:13.708 --> 00:17.083
chasin' some honeybees

00:17.083 --> 00:20.208
I know he's out there

00:24.750 --> 00:27.875
we're so adventurous

00:27.875 --> 00:31.208
and again

00:31.208 --> 00:34.416
and there's nobody home

00:34.416 --> 00:37.625
to count on a friend

00:37.625 --> 00:40.833
Winnie the Pooh Bear

00:43.750 --> 00:45.208
take me, please?

00:45.208 --> 00:48.500
I got to be there

00:50.208 --> 00:53.708
Winnie the Pooh

01:09.166 --> 01:12.000
Welcome,
ladies and gentle poohs!

01:12.000 --> 01:15.291
I, Tigger the Terrific,
will now perform

01:15.291 --> 01:17.625
a spectacle
of spectacular magic.

01:17.625 --> 01:19.958
Nothing up my sleeves,
nothing in my head.

01:19.958 --> 01:22.416
-

01:26.708 --> 01:29.083
Oh, dear. What was that?

01:29.083 --> 01:32.500
I think it's just the spectacle
of magic warming up.

01:32.500 --> 01:35.625
Now you see the "hanky-chief,"
now you don't.

01:35.625 --> 01:38.583
Tigger, where is
the handkerchief?

01:38.583 --> 01:42.333
In the Land of Enchantment.

01:42.333 --> 01:44.000
Oh, is that the same place
socks go?

01:44.000 --> 01:47.583
A magician never reveals
his secrets...

01:47.583 --> 01:49.875
'specially when he isn't
too sure about 'em himself.

01:51.250 --> 01:54.000
It's amazing!
And to think,

01:54.000 --> 01:57.125
this magical box looks
just like the vacuum

01:57.125 --> 01:59.375
Gopher uses to clean out
his tunnels.

01:59.375 --> 02:03.875
One guy's vacuum is another
guy's "prestigurgitation."

02:03.875 --> 02:06.416
If I might have a volunteer
from the audience?

02:08.708 --> 02:12.250
Piglet, how come no one
is volunteering?

02:13.750 --> 02:17.083
I practiced this magic tricky
all day.

02:17.083 --> 02:18.958
And now, nobody will help me.

02:18.958 --> 02:22.125
Why, thank you, Piglet.

02:22.875 --> 02:27.833
Tigger, what is a very small
volunteer supposed to do?

02:27.833 --> 02:30.416
Just wave the "hanky-chief"
over the hose

02:30.416 --> 02:32.625
and let the magic begin!

02:32.625 --> 02:35.208
Yipe!

02:35.208 --> 02:39.833
Piglet, you were just supposed
to make the handkerchief
disappear.

02:39.833 --> 02:41.750
Where are you?

02:41.750 --> 02:45.208
In the Land of Enchantment,
which is awfully dark.

02:45.208 --> 02:48.208
Will you be needing
another volunteer?

02:48.208 --> 02:50.208
Not this time, buddy bear.

02:50.208 --> 02:53.208
A good magician can un-magic
his own magic, you know.

02:53.208 --> 02:55.875
It's as easy as flicking
the right switcheroo,

02:55.875 --> 02:57.583
if the right switcheroo
can be found.

02:57.583 --> 03:00.583
Oh, we'll! Show's over!

03:00.583 --> 03:04.166
But how shall we
un-dissapear Piglet?

03:04.166 --> 03:05.583
When in doubt...

03:09.625 --> 03:12.500
Help!

03:12.500 --> 03:15.208
How's come Piglet gets
to have all the fun?

03:15.208 --> 03:18.708
Pooh: Piglet, just pretend
you're a very small cloud.

03:18.708 --> 03:22.375
They don't make magic stuff
like they used to.

03:23.583 --> 03:24.583
Whoa!

03:27.375 --> 03:29.833
At least the little feller's
still flying high.

03:31.291 --> 03:33.458
Help! There's a big,
white monster dog under me!

03:33.458 --> 03:36.416
Say, what's Skippy doing
over here?

03:36.416 --> 03:39.708
Perhaps he wanted to play.

03:39.708 --> 03:41.583
Oh, no! He's going to eat me!

03:41.583 --> 03:43.416
He's starting at the bottom
and working his way up.

03:43.416 --> 03:45.416
Don't worry, Piglet.

03:45.416 --> 03:47.458
You won't become a
"doggy-horse-dervery."

03:57.875 --> 04:00.333
Piglet, you can come out now.

04:00.333 --> 04:03.833
Piglet: I think I'll stay in the
Land of Enchantment for a little
while longer.

04:03.833 --> 04:05.625
There aren't any white
monster dogs in here.

04:05.625 --> 04:09.833
There aren't any out here,
either.

04:09.833 --> 04:11.458
I hope you're right.

04:13.875 --> 04:16.333
Oh, no! He's back!
He's back!

04:21.291 --> 04:25.083
Gopher:
Oh, there you are, you loafer!

04:25.083 --> 04:28.375
You promised to help me get
the dirt out of my tunnel.

04:28.375 --> 04:32.083
I turned 'round, and you
skedaddled with my vacuum.

04:32.083 --> 04:33.833
And my dirt!

04:33.833 --> 04:37.083
I was taking a break,
so I borrowed the vacuum.

04:37.083 --> 04:38.458
I would have brought it back
in a few minutes.

04:38.458 --> 04:41.708
A few minutes, my front teeth.

04:41.708 --> 04:45.083
Besides, you didn't even ask
to borrow it.

04:45.083 --> 04:47.291
- Can I borrow the--
- No!

04:47.291 --> 04:50.000
It'll be a cold day in summer

04:50.000 --> 04:53.875
when I loan anything to someone
as irresponsible as you!

04:53.875 --> 04:55.708
And another thing--

05:09.625 --> 05:13.166
Imagine anybody thinking
I'm not responsible.

05:13.166 --> 05:15.125
Responsible's my middle name.

05:15.125 --> 05:18.083
Why, I'm responsible
for you guys having fun.

05:18.083 --> 05:20.250
- Fun?
- Christopher Robin: Hi, guys.

05:20.250 --> 05:24.125
- What have you been up to?
- The ceiling.

05:24.125 --> 05:27.083
Is there something
you want to share with us,
Christopher Robin?

05:27.083 --> 05:29.000
Something sweet, I hope?

05:29.000 --> 05:31.750
I just got my first real job.

05:31.750 --> 05:33.958
Pooh: Congratulations!

05:33.958 --> 05:37.000
- Yeah! And celebrations, too!
- Always knew you could do it!

05:37.000 --> 05:41.375
I'm gonna take care
of the neighbor's dog
for the whole day.

05:43.583 --> 05:46.375
So that's what Skippy
was doing here.

05:46.375 --> 05:47.625
Oh, dear.

05:47.625 --> 05:49.500
Hey, Christopher Robin!

05:49.500 --> 05:51.083
What can we do to help?

05:51.083 --> 05:52.750
Whatever it is,
you can depend on me.

05:52.750 --> 05:55.708
Well, I have to make sure
he gets fed,

05:55.708 --> 05:58.291
stays clean, is walked, and...

06:00.125 --> 06:02.458
- Yipe!
-

06:02.458 --> 06:06.375
Piglet's been through
a lot today.

06:06.375 --> 06:09.708
Stop that right now!

06:09.708 --> 06:11.458
Who does that pooch think he is,

06:11.458 --> 06:13.708
knocking people over like that,
a tigger?

06:13.708 --> 06:16.250
Piglet, suppose we go over

06:16.250 --> 06:20.833
and make lifelong friends
with the dog for life?

06:20.833 --> 06:23.833
Which could end as soon as
we become lifelong friends.

06:23.833 --> 06:27.375
This is fun! If I show Mom
I could take care of Skippy,

06:27.375 --> 06:29.416
maybe she'll let me have
one of my own.

06:29.416 --> 06:32.583
Are you sure you want
such a very large dog

06:32.583 --> 06:34.583
with such very big teeth?

06:34.583 --> 06:37.375
Wouldn't you rather have
a nice small goldfish?

06:37.375 --> 06:38.750
No, Piglet.

06:38.750 --> 06:41.583
I just know having
a dog would be great.

06:48.875 --> 06:51.583
You were supposed
to fetch the ball.

06:51.583 --> 06:55.166
He's getting closer.
At least the tire's round.

06:55.166 --> 06:58.166
There. Time for a lunch break.

06:58.166 --> 07:01.166
Peanut butter and honey,
without the peanut butter!

07:01.166 --> 07:03.625
- My favorite!
-

07:03.625 --> 07:05.375
Oh, bother.

07:05.375 --> 07:09.625
I suppose this is what
is meant by a light lunch.

07:10.000 --> 07:11.875
Don't you ever get full?

07:11.875 --> 07:13.416
I certainly hope so.

07:15.875 --> 07:19.000
He's like a bottomless pit bull.

07:24.291 --> 07:27.875
Again? This is not
what I bargained for.

07:27.875 --> 07:29.958
Anybody else wanna take him
for a walk?

07:36.583 --> 07:39.958
Christopher Robin, are you
taking Skippy out again?

07:39.958 --> 07:43.208
- Yes, Mom.
- How are you two getting along?

07:43.208 --> 07:45.958
Just great, Mom.

07:45.958 --> 07:47.500
He does exactly
what I tell him.

07:47.500 --> 07:50.750
Sit. Sit.

07:50.750 --> 07:54.083
Well, as long
as you can handle the job.

07:54.083 --> 07:55.833
Piece of cake!

07:57.166 --> 07:59.166
Heel! Heel!

08:02.000 --> 08:04.333
Good boy.
Why don't you take a nap,

08:04.333 --> 08:07.833
say, till your owners get home?

08:07.833 --> 08:09.583
Hey, stop it!

08:09.583 --> 08:11.458
Let me try to reason
with him.

08:12.750 --> 08:14.625
Tigger, what are you doing?

08:14.625 --> 08:16.583
Well, he's a sheep dog,
isn't he?

08:18.375 --> 08:20.458
- Oh, bother.
-

08:20.458 --> 08:22.458
Pooh, make that sound again.

08:22.458 --> 08:25.750
- I don't know how
I made it the first time.
-

08:27.458 --> 08:30.833
I think we just solved
our dog-sitting problem.

08:32.583 --> 08:34.083
Fetch!

08:37.708 --> 08:39.875
Say, Christopher Robin,

08:39.875 --> 08:42.250
now that you got
that "Wooly Mastodog" trained,

08:42.250 --> 08:44.333
mind if we go
for a little bounce?

08:44.333 --> 08:47.458
Hmm. One lap around
the yard can't hurt.

08:47.458 --> 08:49.375
Come on, Pooh Boy,

08:49.375 --> 08:51.708
let's go for a little
doggyback ride.

08:51.708 --> 08:53.625
Good thing you guys
aren't very heavy,

08:53.625 --> 08:55.416
or the dog couldn't carry you.

08:55.416 --> 08:58.333
Are you sure you don't want
to come along, Piglet?

08:58.333 --> 09:00.583
You aren't very heavy, either.

09:00.583 --> 09:02.375
If I have to see this dog,

09:02.375 --> 09:04.958
I'd rather do it from
where he can't see me.

09:09.583 --> 09:12.125
This is the only way
to fly, Pooh Boy!

09:12.125 --> 09:14.708
- Throw the horn again, Ted!
- Why not?

09:14.708 --> 09:16.750
It's the only thing
this dog knows how to do.

09:16.750 --> 09:18.708
- Watch how far it goes.

09:28.458 --> 09:30.000
Thanks a lot.

09:30.000 --> 09:31.708
Sometimes nowhere is safe.

09:31.708 --> 09:33.875
Christopher Robin:
Skippy! Look at you!

09:33.875 --> 09:36.375
I promised the neighbors
I'd keep you clean.

09:36.375 --> 09:38.250
So I guess this means a bath.

09:39.708 --> 09:41.583
Where do you think
you're going?

09:41.583 --> 09:44.125
I'm gonna get some soap.

09:44.125 --> 09:46.083
- You guys are in charge.
- Righto!

09:46.083 --> 09:48.708
Being in charge
is what tiggers do the best.

09:48.708 --> 09:52.416
Christopher Robin has been
in there a long time.

09:52.416 --> 09:54.500
Maybe he can't find the bubbles.

09:54.500 --> 09:57.708
Then this is the perfect time
for another bounce.

09:57.708 --> 09:59.458
I don't know.

09:59.458 --> 10:04.458
I believe we're supposed
to bewatchingthe dog.

10:04.458 --> 10:06.708
We'll be right on top of him.

10:06.708 --> 10:09.083
You can't do any closer
watching than that.

10:09.083 --> 10:13.208
Well, as long as it's what
Christopher Robin wants,

10:13.208 --> 10:14.708
then I guess it's okay.

10:14.708 --> 10:16.458
There's still plenty of room!

10:16.458 --> 10:18.291
No, thank you.

10:18.291 --> 10:21.708
Piglet's missing a lot by being
scared of a little doggy.

10:21.708 --> 10:24.458
I'm not scared
of a little doggy.

10:27.125 --> 10:30.750
I'm scared of a big, white
monster dog that wants
to eat me.

10:30.750 --> 10:34.875
Oh, Piglet, he already ate
two bowls of dog food,

10:34.875 --> 10:38.500
your sandwich, my sandwich,
and a pine cone.

10:38.500 --> 10:40.583
He doesn't have any room left,

10:40.583 --> 10:45.583
even for a small
but very brave animal.

10:45.583 --> 10:47.708
You should know
about being full, Pooh...

10:47.708 --> 10:49.833
and about my being very brave.

10:51.125 --> 10:53.083
Just in case.

10:53.083 --> 10:56.083
One for the money,
two for the show,

10:56.083 --> 10:58.083
three to get root beer,
and four to--

11:07.125 --> 11:08.458
Bear overboard!

11:13.875 --> 11:17.708
Tigger, would you slow him down
just a little? Yipe!

11:17.708 --> 11:22.708
- I wonder where Piglet got to?
-

11:22.708 --> 11:25.208
Whoa!

11:25.208 --> 11:28.583
The little guy's really getting
the hang of it.

11:28.583 --> 11:31.083
I am not brave. I am not brave.

11:33.375 --> 11:35.958
Okay, let's get this dog washed.

11:37.583 --> 11:41.000
Christopher Robin,
we have something to tell you.

11:41.000 --> 11:43.708
Where's Skippy?

11:43.708 --> 11:48.000
By the way he was running,
I'd say he was in Alaska by now.

11:48.000 --> 11:49.083
What?

11:49.083 --> 11:51.875
I only hope Piglet likes snow.

11:55.416 --> 11:57.083
How could you let this happen?

11:57.083 --> 11:59.875
You were supposed to watch him
until I got back.

11:59.875 --> 12:03.000
I guess you can't do good
watching while you're bouncing.

12:03.000 --> 12:06.333
Oh, great.
Now I gotta find him.

12:06.333 --> 12:08.375
As I recall, the dog,

12:08.375 --> 12:11.500
and my very dear friend,
Piglet, went that way.

12:11.500 --> 12:13.750
Look out where I'm going!

12:13.750 --> 12:15.500
- Ahh!
-

12:15.500 --> 12:18.000
- Oh, dear.
-

12:19.000 --> 12:21.083
Don't come any closer, you--

12:21.083 --> 12:23.458
- Oh, my.

12:23.458 --> 12:25.291
Please don't take
this personally,

12:25.291 --> 12:27.291
but I don't ever want
to see you again.

12:27.291 --> 12:28.875
So I'm closing my eyes.

12:28.875 --> 12:32.000
And when I count to three,
you'll be gone.

12:32.000 --> 12:36.208
One, two, three.

12:38.291 --> 12:40.750
- Maybe he doesn't
know how to count.

12:40.750 --> 12:42.708
Well, I don't care
if you do eat me.

12:42.708 --> 12:45.083
I have to get you back
to Christopher Robin's.

12:46.750 --> 12:50.000
I don't see any sign of Skippy
or Piglet.

12:50.000 --> 12:52.166
If only we had that horn.

12:52.166 --> 12:56.166
Yes. It made such a sound sound.

12:56.166 --> 13:00.333
Sort of like "squonky, squonky."

13:00.333 --> 13:02.166
Hmm.

13:02.166 --> 13:06.166
For a minute, I thought you
sounded just like the horn.

13:06.166 --> 13:09.083
Really?
I can also do a bottle of pop.

13:11.375 --> 13:13.958
If only there was some way
to make it louder.

13:15.583 --> 13:18.458
- I meant the horn sound.
- Oh.

13:18.458 --> 13:20.875
Man on P.A.:
Attention shoppers!

13:20.875 --> 13:23.375
There's a special
for the next 30 seconds

13:23.375 --> 13:27.000
on all special items!
Aisle 19!

13:27.000 --> 13:28.958
The Stupendo Market!

13:34.250 --> 13:37.083
Pounds of plump plumbs
picked for perfection!

13:37.083 --> 13:38.875
Aisle six!

13:38.875 --> 13:40.125
Perfect.

13:40.125 --> 13:43.125
One, two, three,
four, five. Hmm.

13:43.125 --> 13:47.083
One, two, three,
four, five, six. Hmm.

13:47.083 --> 13:51.625
One, two, three, four, five.

13:51.625 --> 13:54.166
Remember,
I'll create a diversion

13:54.166 --> 13:58.583
while you go over there
and make the sound
in that microphone.

13:59.750 --> 14:02.458
-

14:02.458 --> 14:06.375
Everything's fine now.
We'll be home soon...

14:06.375 --> 14:09.000
- if you don't get hungry.
-

14:12.125 --> 14:14.333
Let me do all the talking.

14:14.333 --> 14:16.500
- Excuse me.
- Yes?

14:16.500 --> 14:18.875
My child needs some baby food.

14:18.875 --> 14:21.875
Waah!

14:21.875 --> 14:24.958
We have all your baby needs
on aisle three.

14:24.958 --> 14:27.250
Anyhow, as I was saying,

14:27.250 --> 14:31.083
we have bottles, formula,
baby oil, pacifiers--

14:31.083 --> 14:34.250
Hope I don't get stage fright.

14:34.250 --> 14:37.458
Testing, one, two, three.

14:37.458 --> 14:40.083
Testing. Mi-mi-mi-mi!

14:40.083 --> 14:42.708
Rivet, rivet.

14:42.708 --> 14:45.000
Now, what was I supposed
to do again?

14:45.000 --> 14:48.708
Oh, yeah! Squonky! Squonky!

14:48.708 --> 14:50.250
After I get him home,

14:50.250 --> 14:52.166
I'll never have to see
this dog again.

14:52.166 --> 14:53.708
Tigger: Squonky! Squonky!

14:53.708 --> 14:56.416
Oh, no! Don't get any ideas!

14:56.416 --> 15:00.250
Squonky! Squonky!

15:00.250 --> 15:03.375
Stop! I'm too young to fly!

15:03.375 --> 15:07.708
We also have safety pins,
baby powder, diapers,
cotton swabs--

15:11.333 --> 15:13.708
Squonky! Squonky!

15:13.708 --> 15:18.000
Squonky? I don't carry
any squonky.

15:18.000 --> 15:19.708
Help!

15:37.500 --> 15:38.875
Whoa!

15:41.000 --> 15:42.083
Squonky!

15:45.958 --> 15:48.708
This ain't the time to eat,
Buddy Bear.

15:55.125 --> 15:57.083
- Oh, dear.
- Oh, bother.

16:13.458 --> 16:16.291
- Help! Help!

16:18.416 --> 16:19.500
Gotcha!

16:21.125 --> 16:23.500
We'll have to hurry home
and wash this dog.

16:23.500 --> 16:26.000
Tigger:
That mutt is ten times dirtier

16:26.000 --> 16:27.583
than when it was dirty before.

16:27.583 --> 16:31.291
Well, then, we shall have
to give him 14 baths.

16:31.291 --> 16:34.000
No. Just one bath, and fast.

16:34.000 --> 16:35.833
The neighbors will be back soon.

16:35.833 --> 16:38.750
If we're lucky, they'll
never know what happened.

16:38.750 --> 16:42.375
Then, after we return the dog,
we could return the cart.

16:42.375 --> 16:46.583
Boy, I never thought taking care
of a dog would be so tough.

16:46.583 --> 16:50.333
Home at last!
And we're gonna make it in time.

16:50.333 --> 16:52.583
You can stop squeezing
the horn now, Piglet.

16:54.958 --> 16:56.708
-

16:58.000 --> 17:00.458
Whoa!

17:04.500 --> 17:06.333
Mad dog!

17:12.708 --> 17:14.625
-

17:14.625 --> 17:17.500
After you, Pooh Boy.

17:21.708 --> 17:24.083
I can't believe
this happened.

17:24.083 --> 17:26.375
They trusted me
with their dog,

17:26.375 --> 17:28.708
and I lost him twice.

17:28.708 --> 17:30.458
You did your best.

17:30.458 --> 17:34.333
No, Pooh. I never should have
left the dog alone.

17:34.333 --> 17:36.083
It was my responsibility.

17:36.083 --> 17:38.166
But you didn't leave him alone,
Christopher Robin.

17:38.166 --> 17:39.875
You left him with us.

17:39.875 --> 17:42.333
I better figure out
what I'm gonna tell
the neighbors.

17:42.333 --> 17:44.833
Maybe you could break it
to him easy.

17:44.833 --> 17:47.750
Like, tell him how much they'll
save on dog food from now on.

17:47.750 --> 17:50.458
Pooh:
Oh, poor Christopher Robin.

17:50.458 --> 17:53.166
I wish there was something
we could do

17:53.166 --> 17:55.583
that we haven't already done.

17:55.583 --> 17:58.416
There is!
I'm gonna find that dog!

17:58.416 --> 18:02.333
I don't know how, I don't know
where, I don't know when.

18:02.333 --> 18:04.708
Boy, I sure don't know much.

18:04.708 --> 18:07.458
But I do know
this is my responsibility,

18:07.458 --> 18:09.583
and I'm gonna do something
about it.

18:09.583 --> 18:12.000
If only I had a clue--
Anything!

18:12.000 --> 18:13.583
I'll follow 'em to the ends
of the earth,

18:13.583 --> 18:16.500
across oceans,
over mountains,

18:16.500 --> 18:18.000
as far as I can go!

18:18.000 --> 18:20.000
Without crossing the street,
of course.

18:20.000 --> 18:21.458
-

18:21.458 --> 18:25.000
Uh, Tigger, excuse me.
About finding the dog?

18:25.000 --> 18:26.875
Just a minute, Piglet.
I'm on a roll here.

18:26.875 --> 18:28.291
-

18:28.291 --> 18:32.083
Follow that-- Wait!
I got a better idea!

18:33.875 --> 18:35.583
Gopher!

18:37.250 --> 18:38.875
You hollered, sonny?

18:38.875 --> 18:42.000
I promise, if you let me
use the vacuum again,

18:42.000 --> 18:44.583
I'll polish all your tunnels
till they shine.

18:44.583 --> 18:47.958
Why should I believe you?

18:47.958 --> 18:49.625
Because I have changed.

18:49.625 --> 18:52.958
I'm responsible now.

18:52.958 --> 18:55.208
And Christopher Robin needs me.

18:55.208 --> 19:00.875
Christopher Robin?
Why didn't you say so
in the first place, sonny?

19:00.875 --> 19:03.458
You got yourself a deal.

19:06.375 --> 19:09.708
Plug her in.
Press the switch to reverse.

19:09.708 --> 19:11.333
And let her rip!

19:13.208 --> 19:15.250
Plugged in and ripping.

19:15.250 --> 19:17.083
All aboard!

19:17.083 --> 19:18.750
We got a dog to catch.

19:18.750 --> 19:20.291
Hit the switch, Pooh Boy.

19:23.958 --> 19:25.583
Yipe!

19:28.625 --> 19:32.500
I wish this leash would stop
playing hard to get.

19:35.291 --> 19:36.875
Fresh out of wind.

19:36.875 --> 19:40.875
Lane left! Lane right!
No, your other right!

19:40.875 --> 19:43.625
Hold on to your skivvies!

19:49.000 --> 19:51.416
Squonky! Squonky!

19:51.416 --> 19:53.500
Get closer!
He can't hear us!

19:53.500 --> 19:56.583
The last thing I ever wanted
to do was see that dog again!

19:58.708 --> 20:01.083
-

20:01.083 --> 20:03.083
Tigger: I got it! I got it!

20:05.333 --> 20:09.375
Isn't that the same car
the neighbors drive,
when they drive?

20:11.583 --> 20:14.375
It is the neighbors.
They're gonna beat us home!

20:14.375 --> 20:17.458
Can't this vacuum go any faster?

20:17.458 --> 20:21.291
Rumblin' tarnation!
Stop your bouncing!

20:21.291 --> 20:22.708
I can't steer!

20:22.708 --> 20:25.416
We're gonna coast from here!

20:29.333 --> 20:32.875
Boy, and I thought I could
take care of a dog of my own.

20:32.875 --> 20:35.333
I never should have left
Skippy alone.

20:35.333 --> 20:38.291
Who knows where he is now.

20:38.291 --> 20:40.958
If I save my allowance
for a year,

20:40.958 --> 20:43.875
maybe I'll have enough
to buy the neighbors a new dog.

20:46.583 --> 20:49.458
Time to face the music.

20:49.458 --> 20:52.000
There's something
I have to tell you.

20:52.000 --> 20:53.833
I lost your dog.

20:53.833 --> 20:55.416
I'm really sorry.

20:55.416 --> 20:56.875
I'll get you a new one.

21:01.166 --> 21:03.083
Boy, am I glad to see you!

21:03.083 --> 21:05.250
- Hey, stop that!

21:05.250 --> 21:07.875
No, don't stop that.

21:07.875 --> 21:13.000
Thank goodness
my fluff is fluffy.

21:13.000 --> 21:15.500
Don't worry about
your vacuum, Gopher.

21:15.500 --> 21:18.000
Now that I'm a responsible
citizen,

21:18.000 --> 21:20.750
I'll clean your tunnels
with my tail if I have to.

21:20.750 --> 21:23.875
It's good for those
hard-to-reach places.

21:23.875 --> 21:29.291
Well, then I'll expect to see
you and your tail in my tunnel.

21:29.291 --> 21:31.625
I'll get started right away,
if not sooner.

21:31.625 --> 21:34.416
Christopher Robin:
Thank you, guys, for everything.

21:34.416 --> 21:38.000
If Piglet hadn't been
so especially brave,

21:38.000 --> 21:41.708
we never could have gotten
the dog back.

21:41.708 --> 21:43.708
I didn't mean to be brave,

21:43.708 --> 21:45.583
it just happened
when I panicked.

21:45.583 --> 21:47.958
And the vacuum
was Tigger's idea.

21:47.958 --> 21:50.458
Very responsible, Tigger.

21:50.458 --> 21:53.458
That's me!
Responsible to a fault!

21:53.458 --> 21:55.375
Actually, a lot of faults.

21:55.375 --> 21:57.416
Oh, I almost forgot.

21:57.416 --> 21:59.458
Mom thought I took care
of Skippy so good,

21:59.458 --> 22:02.458
she said maybe I could get
a dog of my own.

22:03.583 --> 22:05.416
But I didn't say I would.
