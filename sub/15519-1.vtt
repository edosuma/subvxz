02:07.502 --> 02:10.880
<i>Thundershowers are expected
in the Crocodile Falls area</i>

02:10.881 --> 02:14.885
<i>and some of the surrounding
gullies, so take out your...</i>

02:19.097 --> 02:21.140
Cody!

02:21.141 --> 02:22.350
Yeah, Mom?

02:22.351 --> 02:26.103
- What about your breakfast?
- I've got some sandwiches in my pack.

02:26.104 --> 02:29.733
- Be home for supper.
- No worries, Mom.

02:46.083 --> 02:48.376
I know, I'm coming.

02:48.377 --> 02:51.587
Hustle up, Nelson.
Faloo's sounding the call!

02:58.970 --> 03:02.098
Come on, little wombats, hurry!

03:15.860 --> 03:17.947
Who's caught this time?

03:17.948 --> 03:19.156
You don't know her, Cody.

03:19.157 --> 03:21.784
Her name is Marahute,
the great golden eagle.

03:21.785 --> 03:22.827
Where is she?

03:22.828 --> 03:26.122
She's caught, high on a
cliff in a poacher's trap.

03:26.123 --> 03:28.791
- You're the only one who can reach her.
- I'll get her loose.

03:28.792 --> 03:32.296
Righto. Hop on, no time to lose.

03:50.814 --> 03:55.490
She's up on top of that ridge.
Be careful, little friend.

04:21.678 --> 04:24.180
Marahute!

04:35.358 --> 04:38.235
Calm down, calm down.

04:38.236 --> 04:40.404
I'm not gonna hurt you.

04:40.405 --> 04:43.533
That's a girl. Stay still.

04:44.576 --> 04:47.044
It's okay.

04:49.331 --> 04:52.459
No, wait! I'm here to help you.

04:53.043 --> 04:55.216
Easy! Easy!

05:02.135 --> 05:03.719
You're free!

06:02.863 --> 06:05.115
Higher!

06:15.041 --> 06:16.709
Whoa!

07:44.172 --> 07:46.595
Wow.

08:10.907 --> 08:12.954
You're a mom!

08:16.329 --> 08:19.999
They're very warm.
Are they gonna hatch soon?

08:35.682 --> 08:37.604
Where's the daddy eagle?

08:41.688 --> 08:44.691
Oh. My dad's gone, too.

10:05.021 --> 10:07.856
Hey, little fella,
what happened to you?

10:07.857 --> 10:09.399
Oh, no! Get away!

10:09.400 --> 10:12.528
- Don't worry. I'll get you loose.
- It's a trap. Careful!

10:24.681 --> 10:26.752
Got one!

10:28.628 --> 10:31.630
- Are you all right?
- Yeah, I think so.

10:31.631 --> 10:35.180
- Okey-dokey.
- Wait! Hey, come back!

10:48.815 --> 10:50.399
Here you go, grab on.

10:50.400 --> 10:54.736
That's great. Just a little
more, a little further...

10:54.737 --> 10:57.331
There! I got it.

11:36.279 --> 11:38.947
Well, Joanna, what'd we get today?

11:38.948 --> 11:43.285
A dingo, a fat ol' razorback,
or a nice big...

11:43.286 --> 11:45.038
Boy?

11:51.794 --> 11:54.421
Joanna, you been diggin'
holes out here again?

11:54.422 --> 11:58.300
Dumb lizard always trying
to bury squirrels out here.

11:58.301 --> 12:02.262
Uh-uh. It's a trap,
and poaching's against the law.

12:02.263 --> 12:05.599
Trap? Where'd you
get an idea like that?

12:05.600 --> 12:09.149
I think you've been down
in that hole for too long.

12:09.646 --> 12:12.114
Come on, grab hold.

12:16.444 --> 12:21.290
We'll get you out of this old lizard
hole and you can just run along home.

12:21.324 --> 12:24.201
This is a poacher's trap
and you're a poacher.

12:28.498 --> 12:31.000
Let go! Hey, get off of me.

12:32.168 --> 12:34.086
McLEACH: I'm gonna kill her.

12:34.087 --> 12:39.841
I'm gonna kill that dumb, slimy,
egg-sucking salamander.

12:39.842 --> 12:42.746
Cut it out! Get off of me.

12:52.730 --> 12:54.482
Hmm.

12:54.899 --> 12:57.652
Good girl, Joanna.

12:59.904 --> 13:02.531
Say, where'd you get
this pretty feather, boy?

13:02.532 --> 13:03.991
It was a present.

13:03.992 --> 13:07.336
That's real nice. Who gave it to you?

13:07.537 --> 13:09.413
It's a secret.

13:09.414 --> 13:11.832
That's no secret, boy.

13:11.833 --> 13:15.678
You see, I already got the father.

13:17.964 --> 13:22.050
You just tell me where Momma
and those little eggs are.

13:22.051 --> 13:23.593
No!

13:23.594 --> 13:25.721
Joanna, sic him!

13:49.329 --> 13:50.954
You're coming with me, boy.

13:50.955 --> 13:53.332
My mom'll call the rangers!

13:53.333 --> 13:56.586
Oh, no. Not the rangers.
What'll I do?

13:56.711 --> 14:00.213
What'll I do? Don't let
your mom call the rangers!

14:00.214 --> 14:02.842
Please don't!

14:04.218 --> 14:08.472
"My poor baby boy got
eaten by the crocodiles!"

14:08.473 --> 14:10.974
Boo hoo hoo.

14:10.975 --> 14:12.692
Let's go, boy!

14:13.603 --> 14:15.687
Help!

14:15.688 --> 14:17.940
Help!

14:33.289 --> 14:36.541
Help! Someone, help!
McLeach took a little boy.

14:36.542 --> 14:38.043
Send for help!

16:44.921 --> 16:48.882
Code red, code red! Attention all
Rescue Aid Society delegates.

16:48.883 --> 16:52.260
<i>All delegates report immediately
to the main assembly hall.</i>

16:52.261 --> 16:54.095
<i>This is an emergency meeting.</i>

16:54.096 --> 16:57.599
<i>I repeat, this is a code
red emergency meeting!</i>

16:59.852 --> 17:01.686
<i>Order!</i>

17:01.687 --> 17:05.147
<i>Yes, I know it's late, but I'm...
Really? Pajamas?</i>

17:05.148 --> 17:07.776
<i>Hello, Frank, how are you?
Nice to see you!</i>

17:07.777 --> 17:09.778
<i>And Esmerelda, there you are!</i>

17:09.779 --> 17:12.489
<i>Quiet now, please,
everyone pay attention.</i>

17:12.490 --> 17:15.367
<i>There has been a
kidnapping in Australia.</i>

17:15.367 --> 17:18.244
<i>A young boy needs our help.</i>

17:18.246 --> 17:21.705
<i>This is a mission requiring
our very finest,</i>

17:21.707 --> 17:26.538
<i>and I know we are all thinking
of the same two mice.</i>

17:29.322 --> 17:31.675
<i>What's this? Gone?</i>

17:31.676 --> 17:36.226
<i>We must find Bernard and
Miss Bianca at once!</i>

17:48.025 --> 17:50.493
Oh, pea soup.

18:00.496 --> 18:02.669
Pea soup!

18:17.346 --> 18:22.100
To my dear Bernard, and our
wonderful partnership.

18:22.101 --> 18:25.980
Uh, yeah, wonderful.

18:28.316 --> 18:33.486
You've been very quiet this evening.
Is there something on your mind?

18:33.487 --> 18:36.031
Well, um, actually...

18:36.032 --> 18:40.332
- I was wondering...
- Yes, darling?

18:40.369 --> 18:43.497
I... Miss Bianca, would you...

18:44.624 --> 18:46.166
Would you...

18:46.167 --> 18:48.761
Would you excuse me for a minute?

19:06.562 --> 19:09.981
<i>Pardonnez-moi, Mademoiselle</i>
Bianca, I have important news.

19:09.982 --> 19:12.233
Yes, François? What is it?

19:12.234 --> 19:14.569
You and Bernard have
been asked to accept

19:14.570 --> 19:17.405
a dangerous mission to Australia.

19:17.406 --> 19:21.743
The poor boy. This is dreadful.

19:21.744 --> 19:24.579
Now where is Bernard?
I must tell him at once!

19:24.580 --> 19:28.550
Allow me, madame,
I will tell him immediately.

19:46.227 --> 19:47.686
Miss Bianca, will you marry me?

19:47.687 --> 19:50.897
Quickly, Monsieur Bernard!
I must speak with you.

19:50.898 --> 19:55.073
- Not now, François, I'm busy!
- No, monsieur, you don't...

19:58.322 --> 20:02.283
- Bernard, did you talk to François?
- Yes, but there's something I want...

20:02.284 --> 20:05.995
I know what you're going to say.
François told me about it.

20:05.996 --> 20:07.122
He did? How did he...

20:07.123 --> 20:10.750
It doesn't matter, I think
it's a marvelous idea.

20:10.751 --> 20:12.377
You do?

20:12.378 --> 20:14.254
I mean, you really want to?

20:14.255 --> 20:18.967
I don't think it's a matter of
wanting, it's a matter of duty.

20:18.968 --> 20:21.928
Duty? I never thought of it...

20:21.929 --> 20:25.765
Well, all right. How does
next April sound to you?

20:25.766 --> 20:29.811
Heavens, no! We must act
immediately, tonight!

20:29.812 --> 20:32.981
Tonight? But wait!

20:32.982 --> 20:37.736
Bianca, this is so sudden. I mean, don't
you at least need a gown or something?

20:37.737 --> 20:41.906
No, just a pair of khaki
shorts and some hiking boots!

20:41.907 --> 20:43.241
Hiking boots?

20:44.242 --> 20:48.247
Oh, there you are.
Come along, come along.

20:51.333 --> 20:55.086
<i>Delegates, we have an
important announcement.</i>

20:55.087 --> 21:00.049
<i>Bernard and I have decided to
accept the mission to Australia.</i>

21:00.050 --> 21:01.176
Australia?

21:01.177 --> 21:04.679
Good show! Now, you must
fly out immediately!

21:04.680 --> 21:08.057
It's a little nippy outside, but we
won't let that stop us, will we?

21:22.573 --> 21:24.699
Miss Bianca, I'm not
sure it's a good idea

21:24.700 --> 21:26.785
to fly this soon after eating!

21:26.786 --> 21:29.370
Darling, you'll be just fine!

21:29.371 --> 21:32.582
But aren't you supposed
to wait 45 minutes?

21:32.583 --> 21:38.260
Oh, just knock on the door
and see if Orville is there!

21:41.675 --> 21:43.885
Nobody's home, let's go.

21:43.886 --> 21:49.233
This is no time to play in the snow.

21:49.391 --> 21:52.560
I wasn't playing in the snow.
It was an avalanche.

21:52.561 --> 21:54.771
Look, Bernard!

21:54.772 --> 21:58.242
"Under new management, see Wilbur."

22:01.987 --> 22:05.491
Come on, darling.
Let's get a move out!

22:18.254 --> 22:19.838
<i>I'm the cat's pajamas</i>

22:19.839 --> 22:22.173
<i>Always run around
with crazy little mamas</i>

22:22.174 --> 22:23.675
Whoo!

22:23.676 --> 22:25.844
Yoo-hoo! Mr. Wilbur!

22:25.845 --> 22:27.637
Get down there, son!

22:27.638 --> 22:29.230
Hello?

22:29.390 --> 22:33.110
Pick it, boy, pick it! Yeah!

22:34.436 --> 22:38.440
Whoo! Here we go! Let's walk!

22:39.692 --> 22:41.025
Whoo!

22:41.026 --> 22:43.695
Look out! Excuse me, sir.

22:43.696 --> 22:47.448
Do something! He can't hear us!

22:47.449 --> 22:50.077
Big time, big time!

22:50.661 --> 22:53.288
<i>The girls all look when I go by...</i>

22:53.689 --> 22:55.498
Who killed the music?

22:55.499 --> 22:57.171
That's better.

22:57.459 --> 23:02.214
Excuse us for interrupting.
We're from the Rescue Aid Society.

23:02.298 --> 23:04.632
I am Miss Bianca, and this is my...

23:04.633 --> 23:07.135
The Miss Bianca? I don't believe it.

23:07.136 --> 23:11.806
My brother, Orville, told me all about
you. Boy. This is an honor to have...

23:11.807 --> 23:15.018
May I just say, <i>"Enchanté,
señorita,"</i> to you? May I?

23:17.646 --> 23:19.981
We need to charter a flight.

23:19.982 --> 23:24.068
You've come to the right place,
buddy boy. Welcome to...

23:24.069 --> 23:27.822
"Albatross Air. A fair
fare from here to there."

23:27.823 --> 23:31.618
Get it? A fair fare?
It's a play on... Never mind.

23:31.619 --> 23:34.954
I've got tons of exotic
destinations, faraway places,

23:34.955 --> 23:36.456
custom designed for

23:36.457 --> 23:39.051
a romantic weekend getaway.

23:39.209 --> 23:41.669
The finest in-flight accommodations.

23:41.670 --> 23:44.339
Speaking of which,
what can I get you?

23:44.340 --> 23:47.842
How about a nice mango Maui cooler?
Very nice, very tasty.

23:47.843 --> 23:49.515
No, thank you.

23:50.429 --> 23:53.097
A coconut, guava nectar?
It's carbonated.

23:53.098 --> 23:56.351
I got little umbrellas for each one,
and a little coconut thing.

23:56.352 --> 24:00.356
- It's urgent that we leave immediately!
- Nothing? Nothing at all?

24:00.522 --> 24:03.566
- How about a cream soda?
- We need a flight to Australia.

24:03.567 --> 24:05.860
Australia? The land down under?

24:05.861 --> 24:09.614
That's a fabulous idea!
So when can I pencil you in?

24:09.615 --> 24:12.659
After spring thaw?
Mid-June would be very nice.

24:12.660 --> 24:15.128
We must leave tonight.

24:15.746 --> 24:17.564
Tonight?

24:19.166 --> 24:21.376
Come on, you're kidding me, right?

24:21.377 --> 24:24.796
Have you looked outside?
It's suicide out there.

24:24.797 --> 24:27.048
Oh, no. Oh, no.

24:27.049 --> 24:30.218
I'm afraid your jolly little
holiday will have to wait.

24:30.219 --> 24:31.636
What a bunch of jokers.

24:31.637 --> 24:35.473
But you don't understand, a boy
needs our help. He's in trouble.

24:35.474 --> 24:38.768
Boy? You mean,
a little kid kinda boy?

24:38.769 --> 24:40.436
He was kidnapped.

24:40.437 --> 24:43.982
Kidnapped? Oh, that's awful.

24:43.983 --> 24:46.484
Locking up a little kid.

24:46.485 --> 24:48.069
A kid should be free.

24:48.070 --> 24:51.114
Free to run wild through the
house on Saturday mornings.

24:51.115 --> 24:55.076
Free to have cookies and milk,
and get those little white mustaches.

24:55.077 --> 24:58.788
Nobody's gonna take a kid's
freedom away while I'm around.

24:58.789 --> 25:01.249
Does that mean you'll take us?

25:01.250 --> 25:06.927
Storm or no storm,
Albatross Airlines, at your service!

25:07.381 --> 25:10.008
Passengers are requested
to fasten their seat belts

25:10.009 --> 25:11.551
and secure all carry-ons.

25:11.552 --> 25:16.398
We'll be departing following our
pre-flight maintenance. Thank you.

25:16.515 --> 25:19.809
Loosen up, get the blood
flowing up to the head.

25:19.810 --> 25:22.228
And a couple of these...

25:23.397 --> 25:26.150
Okay, one's enough, there we go.

25:27.276 --> 25:30.319
Ah, yeah! That feels
better. Oh, baby.

25:30.320 --> 25:32.613
Tie your kangaroos down, sports fans!

25:32.614 --> 25:35.241
Here we come!

25:35.242 --> 25:40.288
Let's go for it! Whoa! Hey!
I didn't adjust for the winds.

25:40.289 --> 25:43.291
All right, we're gonna make it!
Gotta duck down lower.

25:43.292 --> 25:47.342
Go under the wind, go under it!
Here we go! Whoo-hoo!

25:47.963 --> 25:50.306
Ow! This is cold!

25:51.175 --> 25:53.176
Slippery! Ice!

25:53.177 --> 25:54.802
We got ice!

25:54.803 --> 25:57.305
Whoa! Hang on now!

25:59.725 --> 26:01.852
Here we go!

26:02.478 --> 26:08.405
Whoa! Cowabunga!

26:12.988 --> 26:17.116
Captain, is this a non-stop
flight to Australia?

26:17.117 --> 26:20.995
Well, not exactly no.
I could definitely say no.

26:20.996 --> 26:23.998
We're gonna have to make
connections with a bigger bird.

26:23.999 --> 26:27.628
Non-stop? What do I look like,
Charles Lindbergh?

26:39.139 --> 26:42.850
Let me out of here! Let me go!
You can't do this!

26:42.851 --> 26:45.436
Help!

26:45.437 --> 26:47.355
Breaker, breaker, little mate.

26:47.356 --> 26:52.703
<i>I forgot to tell you around
here, you need to be quiet!</i>

26:53.612 --> 26:56.155
<i>Or the rangers might hear you.</i>

26:56.156 --> 27:00.126
<i>Now sit down and relax,
enjoy the view.</i>

27:00.327 --> 27:05.708
<i>Nothing but abandoned opal mines
as far as the eye can see.</i>

27:06.792 --> 27:10.762
And dead ahead, is home sweet home.

27:11.004 --> 27:14.006
<i>Home, home on the range</i>

27:14.007 --> 27:17.301
<i>Where the critters
are tied up in chains</i>

27:17.302 --> 27:21.180
<i>I cut through their sides
And I rip off their hides</i>

27:21.181 --> 27:24.225
<i>And the next day, I do it again</i>

27:24.226 --> 27:25.309
Everybody!

27:25.310 --> 27:28.896
<i>Home, home on the range...</i>

27:28.897 --> 27:33.277
Cody! Cody!

27:34.736 --> 27:37.455
Cody!

27:42.786 --> 27:46.914
<i>Ladies and gentlemen, Flight 12 is
now approaching Sydney airport.</i>

27:46.915 --> 27:50.042
<i>Make sure your seat belts are
fastened and tables secured.</i>

27:50.043 --> 27:52.762
<i>Enjoy your stay in Australia.</i>

27:56.425 --> 27:58.801
- Are we there yet?
- Yes.

27:58.802 --> 28:01.220
Perhaps we should wake up Wilbur.

28:01.221 --> 28:03.894
All right, I'll get him up.

28:03.932 --> 28:06.385
Wilbur.

28:07.436 --> 28:09.062
Wilbur!

28:09.313 --> 28:10.938
Just five more minutes, Ma.

28:10.939 --> 28:13.900
- Wilbur!
- That's all I need, five more minutes.

28:13.901 --> 28:16.819
Wilbur, are you awake?

28:16.820 --> 28:19.322
- Get up, we're there!
- I'm up, I'm up.

28:19.323 --> 28:21.245
Watch out!

28:22.159 --> 28:25.128
Must have been sleeping on a bolt.

28:26.622 --> 28:28.581
Oh, boy.

28:28.582 --> 28:31.792
Throw another shrimp on the
barbie, 'cause here I come!

28:31.793 --> 28:36.389
- Here we go again!
- Cannonball!

28:40.677 --> 28:43.804
Gangway! Coming through.
Mice on board!

28:43.805 --> 28:46.140
Clear the way! Move over
madam, there you go!

28:46.141 --> 28:49.019
Coming through, sir. Thank you.

28:52.379 --> 28:54.607
Next stop, Mugwomp Flats.

28:54.608 --> 28:57.485
Did we lose anyone back there?

28:57.486 --> 29:01.741
Miss Bianca, from now on,
can't we just take the train?

29:11.041 --> 29:15.795
Well, Sparky, you've had
this coming for a long time.

29:15.796 --> 29:18.173
And now, you're gonna get it.

29:19.341 --> 29:20.842
Ha!

29:27.933 --> 29:29.600
Wise fly.

29:30.978 --> 29:32.270
<i>Mugwomp tower,</i>

29:32.271 --> 29:36.983
<i>this is Albatross 1-3 requesting
permission to land. Over?</i>

29:36.984 --> 29:40.361
Albatross? Let's see.

29:40.362 --> 29:41.988
Finch, wren, scrub-bird, lorikeet,

29:41.989 --> 29:44.031
freckled duck, galah,
Kookaburra, parrot,

29:44.032 --> 29:47.536
cockatoo, alba... It's a jumbo!

29:47.869 --> 29:49.453
Negative, you'll have to turn back.

29:49.454 --> 29:52.790
- Our runway isn't long enough for you.
- <i>Not long enough?</i>

29:52.791 --> 29:55.543
<i>Look pal, I can land
this thing on a dime!</i>

29:55.544 --> 29:58.296
<i>Wilbur, if the runway
isn't long enough...</i>

29:58.297 --> 30:02.466
<i>You can't let radar jockeys push
you around. Leave it to me.</i>

30:02.467 --> 30:05.678
I say again, mate,
our runway is too short.

30:05.679 --> 30:09.307
<i>And I say again, mate, I'm coming in!</i>

30:09.308 --> 30:13.233
Crazy Yank. Quick, Sparky,
we gotta extend the runway.

30:17.649 --> 30:19.233
Here we go!

30:19.234 --> 30:21.202
We'll never make it!

30:24.781 --> 30:26.741
Hot!

30:26.742 --> 30:28.743
Passengers, please remain seated

30:28.744 --> 30:31.495
until the aircraft comes to
a full and complete stop.

30:31.496 --> 30:33.669
Thank you.

30:33.707 --> 30:36.380
Whoa!

30:39.921 --> 30:42.765
Quick, Sparky, we need
to make a drag line!

30:53.894 --> 30:57.521
Don't try and tell me
the runway's too short.

30:57.522 --> 31:00.150
Hold this for me, will you, pal?

31:03.779 --> 31:05.696
Bloke ought to have
his wings clipped.

31:05.697 --> 31:08.824
Captain thanks you for
flying Albatross Airlines...

31:08.825 --> 31:10.159
Crazy Yanks.

31:10.160 --> 31:13.834
They think they can do any fool
thing without regard for...

31:24.132 --> 31:26.092
Welcome to Australia, ma'am.

31:26.093 --> 31:29.813
Name's Jake. If there's any way
I can make your stay pleasant,

31:30.305 --> 31:31.722
don't hesitate to ask.

31:31.723 --> 31:35.142
- Oh, how kind.
- Allow me to get that bag for you.

31:36.043 --> 31:39.438
I've got a lot of luggage here.

31:39.439 --> 31:41.315
Let me give you a hand with those.

31:41.316 --> 31:43.609
Part of the friendly
service at Albatross...

31:44.610 --> 31:46.028
Ow! Big time hurt!

31:46.029 --> 31:47.488
Back! It's out!

31:47.489 --> 31:50.574
- Are you all right?
- Don't worry, I'll handle this.

31:50.575 --> 31:53.994
Sparky, watch the tower. We gotta
get this bird to the hospital.

31:53.995 --> 31:57.999
Can't go down, can't go up.
Take the bags!

32:01.962 --> 32:03.838
- Heave! Ho!
- What are you doing?

32:03.839 --> 32:07.091
What's going on? Wait!

32:07.092 --> 32:11.178
- Wait a minute. Just stop everything.
- Wilbur, don't worry.

32:11.179 --> 32:13.848
We'll come back the
moment we find the boy.

32:13.849 --> 32:17.101
Wait! Wait a minute!
Don't leave me here, please!

32:17.102 --> 32:21.355
I'm feeling much better now.
I'm even ready to hit the beaches.

32:21.356 --> 32:23.833
I'm even ready to mambo.

32:26.027 --> 32:28.154
Doctor, will he be all right?

32:28.155 --> 32:31.323
Now, my dear. Keep a stiff upper lip.

32:31.324 --> 32:35.411
They all come in with a whimper,
and leave with a grin.

32:35.412 --> 32:40.042
Off with you now. Leave everything
to me. Shoo, shoo. Off you go.

32:40.125 --> 32:43.377
Hop to it, ladies. We've got
a bent bird on our hands.

32:43.378 --> 32:47.047
- Move, bustle, bustle. That's it.
- Will it hurt, Doc?

32:47.048 --> 32:49.633
Dear boy, you won't feel a thing.

32:49.634 --> 32:52.928
- Launch the back brace!
- Hey, wait!

32:54.329 --> 32:56.849
I've been skewered!

32:56.850 --> 32:59.059
I've already missed
tea, Mr. Albatross.

32:59.060 --> 33:03.105
Now don't force me to take
drastic measures. You must relax.

33:03.106 --> 33:06.275
Relax? I have never been
more relaxed in my life!

33:06.276 --> 33:09.404
If I were any more
relaxed, I'd be dead!

33:10.363 --> 33:12.364
I'm not convinced.

33:12.365 --> 33:13.991
60 milligrams!

33:13.992 --> 33:16.202
60 milligrams.

33:16.203 --> 33:17.920
Hey! What?

33:18.121 --> 33:20.789
Are you guys crazy?
You can't do that to me!

33:20.790 --> 33:23.042
I'm an American citizen, buddy!

33:23.043 --> 33:24.919
- Better double it!
- Double?

33:24.920 --> 33:27.296
- Double, coming up!
- No!

33:27.297 --> 33:29.590
Prepare the albatross for medication.

33:29.591 --> 33:33.385
I'm dreaming! Come on,
Wilbur. Wake up, boy!

33:33.386 --> 33:35.054
- Three degrees right.
- Come on!

33:35.055 --> 33:37.765
- Three degrees right.
- Down two degrees.

33:37.766 --> 33:39.099
Don't go down two!

33:39.100 --> 33:40.768
- Down two degrees.
- Ready!

33:40.769 --> 33:42.770
No, I'm not ready! No, please!

33:42.771 --> 33:44.272
Aim!

33:44.564 --> 33:46.732
Please don't do this to me.

33:46.733 --> 33:47.816
Fire!

33:53.865 --> 33:56.158
Now we just gotta figure
out how to get there.

33:56.159 --> 34:00.955
So are you and your husband here
on a little outback excursion?

34:00.956 --> 34:03.458
No, we're not married.

34:05.126 --> 34:08.462
In fact, we're here on
a top secret mission.

34:08.463 --> 34:10.590
Very hush-hush.

34:10.799 --> 34:12.925
Gonna rescue that kid McLeach nabbed?

34:12.926 --> 34:15.636
Why, that's right! How did you know?

34:15.637 --> 34:19.431
You'll find it's tough to keep
secrets in the outback, miss.

34:19.431 --> 34:22.059
So which way you taking?

34:22.060 --> 34:25.603
Suicide Trail through Nightmare
Canyon, or shortcut at Satan's Ridge?

34:25.605 --> 34:28.065
- "Suicide Trail"?
- Good choice.

34:28.065 --> 34:30.484
More snakes, less quicksand.

34:30.485 --> 34:35.030
Then once you cross Bloodworm Creek,
you're scot-free, that is until...

34:35.031 --> 34:36.407
<i>Dead Dingo Pass.</i>

34:36.408 --> 34:40.911
Wait a minute, I don't see
any of that stuff on the map.

34:40.911 --> 34:43.163
A map's no good in the outback!

34:43.164 --> 34:47.835
What you really need is someone
who knows the territory.

34:47.835 --> 34:50.504
Mr. Jake, will you guide us?

34:50.505 --> 34:52.505
At your service!

34:52.507 --> 34:56.176
Better take my arm, miss.
It's gonna be a treacherous hike.

34:56.177 --> 35:00.347
I remember the time it was just
me and 400 of these big, giant...

35:00.348 --> 35:03.852
Doesn't even know how to fold a map.

35:09.024 --> 35:12.494
This is how we get around
in the outback, Miss B.

35:12.694 --> 35:15.404
The only way to travel, Berno.

35:15.405 --> 35:19.455
Yeah, it's just a
little bumpy back here.

35:25.498 --> 35:29.548
Cinch up your seat belts, mates.
We're coming in for a landing.

35:32.631 --> 35:35.725
Hold it, not yet!

36:00.575 --> 36:03.077
Well, boy, let's see
if we can do something

36:03.078 --> 36:07.208
to refresh that rusty,
old memory of yours.

36:10.251 --> 36:13.087
Is she on Satan's Ridge?

36:13.088 --> 36:16.882
Or Nightmare Canyon?

36:16.883 --> 36:18.430
What do you think?

36:20.586 --> 36:22.546
Yeah, that's it.

36:22.555 --> 36:27.777
Right smack dab in the
middle at Croc Falls!

36:28.436 --> 36:32.022
- Am I getting warm?
- I told you, I don't remember.

36:32.023 --> 36:36.778
Don't you realize a bird that
size is worth a fortune?

36:37.153 --> 36:40.280
I'll split the money 50/50.
You can't get a better offer than that.

36:40.281 --> 36:44.159
You won't have any money after
the rangers get through with you.

36:58.800 --> 37:01.302
Jake's been gone... Ow!

37:02.137 --> 37:04.471
Been gone a long time.

37:04.472 --> 37:06.974
Maybe I should go... Oh!

37:07.475 --> 37:09.309
Maybe I should go look for him.

37:09.310 --> 37:13.188
Don't you worry about Jake.
He can handle himself.

37:13.189 --> 37:14.773
Yeah, I noticed.

37:14.774 --> 37:17.743
I am just sure he'll
be back in no time.

37:25.660 --> 37:29.997
You know, now that
we're alone, there's...

37:29.998 --> 37:33.542
There's something that I've
been wanting to ask you.

37:33.543 --> 37:35.586
Yes? What is it?

37:35.587 --> 37:39.006
Well, it's like this.

37:39.007 --> 37:44.104
Miss Bianca, I would be most honored

37:44.554 --> 37:46.221
if...

37:46.222 --> 37:48.599
Look out!

37:52.437 --> 37:55.355
No mice for you, Twister, not today!

37:55.356 --> 37:56.857
There!

37:57.776 --> 37:59.234
Miss Bianca!

37:59.235 --> 38:01.862
I've been looking all over for you.

38:01.863 --> 38:03.864
Now look.

38:03.865 --> 38:07.451
We got a long way to go,
and you're gonna take us there.

38:07.452 --> 38:10.580
You're not gonna give us
any trouble about it.

38:10.830 --> 38:13.298
Right?

38:14.876 --> 38:18.337
They're harmless once you look them
in the eye, let them know who's boss.

38:18.338 --> 38:21.215
Ain't that right, mate? Now get.

38:21.216 --> 38:26.053
It's all right, Bernard.
Jake has everything under control.

38:26.054 --> 38:29.103
Yeah, I noticed.

38:30.225 --> 38:35.145
You know, Miss Bianca, truth be told,
I used to be quite a dingo wrestler.

38:35.146 --> 38:38.190
There was this one time,
it was just me and 300

38:38.191 --> 38:40.776
of these ferocious,
mouse-eating dingoes.

38:40.777 --> 38:43.575
Had me surrounded...

39:00.505 --> 39:03.303
I'll give you a night down
here to think it over.

39:04.717 --> 39:09.438
But tomorrow, no more Mr. Nice Guy.

39:11.099 --> 39:13.934
Joanna! You thick-headed
chunk of fish-bait!

39:16.479 --> 39:18.897
I'll never tell you where she is!

39:18.898 --> 39:21.696
Never! Never!

39:23.152 --> 39:28.490
Yeah, we'll never tell!
You'll have to drag it out of us!

39:28.491 --> 39:30.789
Hey, where did you come from?

39:31.619 --> 39:33.036
The desert?

39:33.037 --> 39:36.623
Well, fancy that!

39:36.624 --> 39:40.419
Looks like McLeach has begun
trapping his own kind!

39:40.420 --> 39:43.130
There's no hope for any of us now.

39:43.131 --> 39:45.507
No hope? No hope!

39:45.508 --> 39:48.302
- No!
- But there must be a way out of here.

39:48.303 --> 39:50.762
There's a way out, all right.

39:50.763 --> 39:52.014
There is?

39:52.015 --> 39:53.807
Absolutely.

39:53.808 --> 39:59.313
You'll go as a wallet, you'll go
as a belt, and our dear Frank...

39:59.314 --> 40:02.149
- I don't want to hear it.
- Frank will go as...

40:02.150 --> 40:04.026
I can't hear you!

40:08.907 --> 40:11.658
- A purse.
- No!

40:11.659 --> 40:13.827
A lovely ladies' purse.

40:13.828 --> 40:17.127
I don't want to go as a purse.

40:17.206 --> 40:19.666
Please, don't let him do it!

40:19.667 --> 40:22.669
- Don't worry, we'll get out of here.
- We are?

40:22.670 --> 40:27.382
Yeah. If we all put our heads together,
I'm sure we'll think of something.

40:27.383 --> 40:29.885
Yeah, something.

40:29.886 --> 40:31.428
Frank, what's wrong?

40:31.429 --> 40:33.722
Oh, here he goes again.

40:33.723 --> 40:36.725
Take it easy. You don't want
to hurt yourself again.

40:36.726 --> 40:39.570
Ooh. I got it!

40:40.021 --> 40:42.397
All we gotta do is get the keys!

40:42.398 --> 40:48.153
Oh. Is that all? Well then,
we better start packing our bags.

40:48.154 --> 40:50.405
No, wait. He's right.

40:50.406 --> 40:53.408
If we could get these
long pieces of wood...

40:53.409 --> 40:55.243
Yeah, wood, good.

40:55.244 --> 40:57.313
Maybe we could...

40:58.915 --> 41:02.376
That's right, just a
little more. There!

41:02.377 --> 41:04.920
Come on, everybody.
Get some more stuff!

41:04.921 --> 41:08.550
The kid's right.
What are we waiting for?

41:09.926 --> 41:12.599
That's it, you've got it!

41:13.388 --> 41:16.061
Hurry. We need something
to tie it together.

41:18.893 --> 41:21.979
Hey, what do you got?

41:21.980 --> 41:23.527
Shoelaces!

41:28.569 --> 41:30.616
Almost.

41:32.740 --> 41:35.243
- A little further.
- Yeah, yeah.

41:36.244 --> 41:40.080
- it's okay. Let's try again.
- Yeah, yeah.

41:40.081 --> 41:42.582
Easy. Easy does it.

41:42.583 --> 41:45.002
Yeah, no, no! Yeah, yeah.

41:45.003 --> 41:47.426
Will somebody shut him up?

41:48.131 --> 41:51.100
- We did it!
- You've got it!

42:25.501 --> 42:31.223
I've got it! I'll just take my tail,
and I'll pick the lock, like this!

42:31.632 --> 42:33.175
Frank, give it a rest.

42:33.176 --> 42:35.093
You'll thank me when you're free.

42:35.094 --> 42:39.806
Look, I just insert my tail,
like this, and I turn it like this,

42:39.807 --> 42:44.061
just a quarter turn to the left,
and then push it a little bit further.

42:53.662 --> 42:56.331
Show him who's boss, Berno!

43:30.358 --> 43:33.782
I feel like I got my head in a vice.

43:36.906 --> 43:39.033
Oh!

43:42.036 --> 43:44.788
- Are we ready, nurse?
- Ready, Doctor.

43:44.789 --> 43:47.874
All right, ladies, snap to it!

43:49.377 --> 43:51.595
Ooh, that smarts!

43:52.421 --> 43:54.840
Ah, let me see here.

43:58.845 --> 44:01.388
- Forceps!
- Forceps.

44:01.389 --> 44:04.233
Oh, no, what now?

44:05.268 --> 44:09.523
- Spinal stretch-u-lator.
- That's gonna hurt.

44:10.189 --> 44:11.736
Artery router.

44:12.150 --> 44:13.400
Mother!

44:13.401 --> 44:17.946
This is rusted tight. I wouldn't
dream of using such a tool.

44:17.947 --> 44:20.490
Bring me the epidermal
tissue disrupter!

44:20.491 --> 44:22.659
The epidermal what?

44:22.660 --> 44:25.208
Oh, no! No!

44:33.379 --> 44:35.922
Mr. Albatross,
we haven't operated yet!

44:35.923 --> 44:39.217
- You gotta catch me first, Doc.
- Mr. Albatross, please!

44:39.218 --> 44:41.470
Cowabunga!

44:42.430 --> 44:46.558
Mr. Albatross, we must return
you to the operating room!

44:46.559 --> 44:48.732
You'll never take me alive!

44:49.103 --> 44:51.104
Please don't do this!

44:51.105 --> 44:54.357
Your spine needs tender...

44:54.358 --> 44:57.485
loving... care!

44:59.280 --> 45:02.073
Oh! Oh!

45:04.074 --> 45:06.044
My back!

45:06.245 --> 45:07.746
Hey! Hey!

45:07.747 --> 45:10.415
I can... It works! I'm cured!

45:10.416 --> 45:12.589
My back!

45:12.919 --> 45:15.337
Don't worry!
I'm coming, you little mice.

45:15.338 --> 45:18.048
This is the finest fleet
on two webbed feet.

45:19.049 --> 45:22.474
Oh, boy, I gotta go on
a diet when I get home.

45:23.137 --> 45:25.639
Here we go!

45:39.320 --> 45:41.988
<i>In other news,
authorities in Mugwomp Flats</i>

45:41.989 --> 45:44.491
<i>called off the search
for the missing boy.</i>

45:44.492 --> 45:48.286
<i>His backpack was found near
Crocodile Falls, and rangers believe</i>

45:48.287 --> 45:51.498
<i>he was yet another victim
of crocodile attack.</i>

45:51.499 --> 45:55.377
<i>Authorities once again warn
residents to use extreme caution...</i>

45:56.078 --> 45:58.672
Think you're pretty smart, don't you?

45:58.673 --> 46:02.302
Who outsmarted who?
Who? Who outsmarted who?

46:03.844 --> 46:07.223
I still gotta get
that boy to talking.

46:10.351 --> 46:13.395
I'm hungry. Can't think
on an empty stomach.

46:13.396 --> 46:17.821
Gotta have protein. Gotta have eggs.

46:19.068 --> 46:20.819
Everyone's got his price.

46:20.820 --> 46:23.321
All I gotta do is offer
him whatever he wants,

46:23.322 --> 46:25.950
and then not give it to him.

46:29.370 --> 46:31.338
Did you take one of my eggs?

46:31.914 --> 46:33.415
Open your mouth.

46:36.043 --> 46:39.262
These are not Joanna eggs.

46:39.755 --> 46:42.724
Let's see. The boy's got the eagle.

46:42.800 --> 46:44.509
I want the eagle.

46:44.510 --> 46:47.058
The boy won't give me the eagle.

46:51.726 --> 46:54.144
If I could just find
the boy's weak spot,

46:54.145 --> 46:58.115
I could get him to tell
me where the eagle is.

47:06.032 --> 47:11.584
But the boy's only got one weak
spot, and that is the eagle.

47:17.084 --> 47:21.629
Maybe if I stuck him
in a giant anthill,

47:21.630 --> 47:23.757
that would loosen his
tongue and then...

47:23.758 --> 47:25.676
I got it!

47:26.677 --> 47:29.554
Got your hand caught
in the cookie jar.

47:29.555 --> 47:32.474
Who you think you're messing
with, you dumb animal?

47:32.475 --> 47:38.277
My mental facilities are twice
what yours are, you pea brain.

47:42.485 --> 47:46.613
Joanna, I give you platypus eggs,
I give you snake eggs,

47:46.614 --> 47:52.462
why, I'll even give you eagle eggs,
but I want you to stay away from my...

47:54.455 --> 47:57.290
The eagle's eggs!

47:57.291 --> 47:59.134
That's it!

47:59.377 --> 48:01.544
That's the boy's weak spot!

48:04.340 --> 48:06.508
Push it in a little bit farther,

48:06.509 --> 48:09.137
take it back a little bit...

48:19.522 --> 48:21.564
I give up!

48:21.565 --> 48:25.318
I'll never get this. We're doomed!

48:25.319 --> 48:27.696
Doomed!

48:28.948 --> 48:31.950
Hey, look! Krebbs, Frank's out!

48:31.951 --> 48:33.993
Frank, you're free!

48:33.994 --> 48:35.746
Free?

48:36.914 --> 48:40.041
I'm free! I'm free! I'm free!

48:40.042 --> 48:43.136
Shh! Joanna'll hear!

48:43.796 --> 48:46.845
Double or nothing,
he's caught in five minutes.

48:47.049 --> 48:49.843
- Calm down, little mate.
- Didn't I tell you?

48:49.844 --> 48:52.512
Look at me, I'm free!

48:52.513 --> 48:54.481
Frank, get the keys.

48:54.723 --> 48:56.520
I should get the keys.

48:58.102 --> 48:59.477
I'm stuck!

48:59.478 --> 49:01.354
Shh! Quiet!

49:01.355 --> 49:02.981
Quiet, you fool!

49:02.982 --> 49:06.067
Take it easy, I'll get you loose.

49:06.068 --> 49:07.444
There you go.

49:08.745 --> 49:11.901
Now go get the keys.

49:11.907 --> 49:14.660
The keys. Yeah, yeah.
Keys, keys, keys.

49:16.704 --> 49:17.996
I can't reach them.

49:17.997 --> 49:19.998
Quick, get something to stand on.

49:19.999 --> 49:22.125
Stand on, something to stand on.

49:22.126 --> 49:23.543
This ought to be rich.

49:23.544 --> 49:25.887
Stand on...

49:31.719 --> 49:33.391
Frank.

49:34.013 --> 49:37.474
Use the box! Climb up on the box!

49:37.475 --> 49:40.319
Of course, a box!

49:50.613 --> 49:53.698
- Quiet!
- These darn things are heavy!

50:06.712 --> 50:07.795
Whoops.

50:12.218 --> 50:15.096
The keys, give us the keys!

50:17.431 --> 50:19.933
Over here! Give us the keys!

50:30.486 --> 50:33.330
Yee-haw! Ride him, Frank!

50:34.156 --> 50:36.616
Yah-hoo! Howdy, howdy!

50:36.617 --> 50:39.035
Howdy, howdy, howdy!

50:45.000 --> 50:50.472
Let me in! Let me in! Let me in!

50:55.469 --> 50:58.222
No! No! No!

50:59.306 --> 51:03.060
No! No! No! No!

51:14.655 --> 51:16.999
Huh. Missed.

51:20.035 --> 51:21.327
McLEACH: Surprise!

51:21.328 --> 51:24.581
If I didn't know better,
I'd think you didn't like it here.

51:24.873 --> 51:28.252
Let me go, let go! Let go!

51:29.878 --> 51:32.676
What are you doing out of your cage?

51:34.675 --> 51:36.593
Hmm. That's better.

51:38.304 --> 51:40.021
Come on, boy.

51:40.931 --> 51:43.975
Say goodbye to your little friends.

51:43.976 --> 51:46.774
It's the last you'll
ever see of them.

51:57.781 --> 51:59.699
There is no time to waste.

51:59.700 --> 52:03.830
- We must try to get in.
- Here, Miss Bianca, start digging.

52:06.298 --> 52:10.168
Has anyone considered
trying, "Open sesame"?

52:12.212 --> 52:14.555
Hey, it worked!

52:22.723 --> 52:25.767
McLEACH: Get out of here! Go on! Get!

52:25.768 --> 52:28.978
Look, Bernard, it's the boy!

52:28.979 --> 52:30.947
And McLeach.

52:34.735 --> 52:36.452
It's all over, boy.

52:37.863 --> 52:40.865
Your bird's dead. Someone shot her.

52:40.866 --> 52:44.620
Shot her, right outta the sky.

52:46.747 --> 52:48.039
No!

52:48.040 --> 52:50.875
What do you mean, no?
You callin' me a liar?

52:50.876 --> 52:52.669
I heard it on the radio.

52:52.670 --> 52:54.921
And she could have been
mine if it weren't for you.

52:54.922 --> 52:58.508
Now you better get,
before I change my mind.

52:58.509 --> 53:00.386
Go on, get!

53:01.637 --> 53:04.806
- Why is he letting him go?
- It's gotta be a trick.

53:04.807 --> 53:08.685
Too bad about those eggs, eh, Joanna.

53:08.686 --> 53:11.729
They'll never survive
without their mother.

53:11.730 --> 53:16.576
Oh, well. Survival of
the fittest, I guess.

53:20.656 --> 53:22.703
Bingo!

53:28.163 --> 53:30.289
- Bird?
- Eggs?

53:30.290 --> 53:32.263
Shh. Listen.

53:41.802 --> 53:46.682
I didn't make it all the way
through third grade for nothing.

53:50.561 --> 53:53.604
Don't know where he's going,
but we can't let him get away.

53:53.605 --> 53:58.155
- Hurry up, you two!
- Quickly, Bernard, now!

54:08.620 --> 54:10.167
Oh, no!

54:20.257 --> 54:22.225
Get between the treads!

54:32.519 --> 54:35.818
Bernard, Bianca, here, catch!

54:35.981 --> 54:40.202
Got it! Miss Bianca, you can do it!

54:58.295 --> 55:01.389
Boy, this is some head wind.

55:02.299 --> 55:06.302
Say, you lovely ladies wouldn't
have seen two little mice

55:06.303 --> 55:09.931
running around down there, would you?

55:09.932 --> 55:11.349
Hey, where you going?

55:11.350 --> 55:14.435
I mean it, I'm looking
for two little mice!

55:14.436 --> 55:16.438
Is it something I said?

55:38.794 --> 55:42.719
He's going down the cliff.
Come on, we gotta warn him.

56:45.152 --> 56:47.780
- Cody.
- Huh?

56:49.114 --> 56:51.532
- Who are you?
- There is no time to explain.

56:51.533 --> 56:54.368
You're in great danger.

56:54.369 --> 56:57.497
Marahute? It can't be!

56:59.666 --> 57:02.385
Cody, wait!

57:05.464 --> 57:07.340
She's alive!

57:07.341 --> 57:10.676
Cody, please! You must listen!

57:10.677 --> 57:13.145
That's right,
McLeach is on the cliff.

57:18.310 --> 57:22.855
Marahute, no! Turn back! Turn back!

57:22.856 --> 57:24.824
Stay away! It's a trap!

57:31.657 --> 57:34.033
I got her! I got her!

57:34.034 --> 57:36.327
Did you see that?

57:36.328 --> 57:39.580
Perfect shot! Perfect shot!

57:39.581 --> 57:41.253
She's mine!

57:41.625 --> 57:43.593
All mine!

57:48.048 --> 57:50.346
No!

57:54.638 --> 57:58.017
Hold tight you two.
We're going for a ride!

57:58.684 --> 58:01.733
- Bianca!
- Bernard!

58:10.564 --> 58:14.365
Meddlin' brat.
Gonna get rid of him for good.

58:20.747 --> 58:22.581
Help, I'm slipping!

58:22.582 --> 58:25.585
Cody, don't move!

58:46.023 --> 58:48.366
There she is, Joanna.

58:49.317 --> 58:52.862
Just look at her.
Look at the size of her.

58:52.863 --> 58:55.698
The rarest bird in the world.

58:55.699 --> 58:58.534
That bird's gonna make me rich.

58:58.535 --> 59:00.958
Filthy rich.

59:01.288 --> 59:06.792
I got what I want.
Now, what does Joanna want?

59:06.793 --> 59:11.514
Does she wanna make
sure that bird stays rare?

59:13.300 --> 59:18.971
How about some great, big,
triple-A, jumbo eagle eggs?

59:18.972 --> 59:20.473
Huh? You want them?

59:20.474 --> 59:23.642
Huh? You want them? Go get them!

59:23.643 --> 59:26.145
No! Please!

59:36.656 --> 59:40.285
Why, whatever is the matter?

59:44.030 --> 59:45.953
Get moving!

01:00:47.351 --> 01:00:50.151
Joanna!

01:00:50.230 --> 01:00:53.816
You hurry up and eat those
eggs and get your tail up here!

01:00:53.817 --> 01:00:55.489
Move it!

01:01:33.565 --> 01:01:36.067
Okay, you guys, she fell for it.

01:01:36.943 --> 01:01:39.161
Looks like the coast is clear.

01:01:39.487 --> 01:01:42.240
Girls? Girls, I'm here!

01:01:43.449 --> 01:01:46.285
Where are you,
you little chickees, you?

01:01:46.286 --> 01:01:47.912
Wilbur?

01:01:47.913 --> 01:01:49.455
Wilbur!

01:01:51.750 --> 01:01:54.378
Don't ever do that to me again!

01:01:54.836 --> 01:01:57.546
Boy, I lost a lot of
feathers on that one.

01:01:57.547 --> 01:01:59.798
Wilbur, am I glad to see you!

01:01:59.799 --> 01:02:02.635
- Help me with these eggs, will you?
- Sure.

01:02:02.636 --> 01:02:05.804
Wait a minute, what the
heck are you doing up here?

01:02:05.805 --> 01:02:09.308
The kidnapper took the
boy and Jake. Miss Bianca.

01:02:09.309 --> 01:02:12.312
Miss Bianca's in trouble? Whoa!

01:02:12.729 --> 01:02:17.149
That's terrible! We gotta do something!
Bernard, I'm disappointed in you.

01:02:17.150 --> 01:02:19.443
Hiding under a nest
while Bianca needs help.

01:02:19.444 --> 01:02:21.987
- I gotta talk to you, mister.
- Wilbur.

01:02:21.988 --> 01:02:26.533
You should start searching the desert
for her, and I'll scan the coastline!

01:02:26.534 --> 01:02:29.119
That's what I'll do.
Ask the chicks on the beach.

01:02:29.120 --> 01:02:30.246
What?

01:02:30.247 --> 01:02:33.374
Listen! There's some chicks
here that need help.

01:02:33.375 --> 01:02:35.627
Really?

01:02:38.129 --> 01:02:40.965
Oh, no. Wait a minute. Hold it.

01:02:40.966 --> 01:02:44.686
I know what you're thinking,
and you're wrong. Don't even, no.

01:02:45.011 --> 01:02:47.805
Don't look at me!
You're getting "no." Understand?

01:02:47.806 --> 01:02:50.434
I will not ever sit on those eggs!

01:02:51.101 --> 01:02:52.695
Aw, nuts!

01:02:54.396 --> 01:02:57.900
Gotta learn to be more assertive.
No is no is no.

01:02:58.525 --> 01:03:00.242
Hey, quit moving in there!

01:03:07.200 --> 01:03:12.830
Well, Joanna, it looks like Lady Luck
has finally decided to smile on us.

01:03:12.831 --> 01:03:15.925
Everything's going our way.

01:03:16.626 --> 01:03:20.212
You can't do this!
You're gonna get in big trouble!

01:03:20.213 --> 01:03:23.341
I'll tell the rangers where you are!

01:03:23.842 --> 01:03:26.060
I almost forgot.

01:03:26.219 --> 01:03:30.690
We got a loose end to tie up,
haven't we, girl?

01:03:44.237 --> 01:03:48.407
Now, now, Cody, we mustn't lose hope.

01:03:48.408 --> 01:03:51.201
- Bernard is still out there.
- That's right!

01:03:51.202 --> 01:03:55.047
If anyone can get us out of
this scrape, it's old Berno!

01:03:56.291 --> 01:03:59.543
- Nice bluff, Miss B.
- I wasn't bluffing.

01:03:59.544 --> 01:04:02.755
You don't know Bernard like I do.

01:04:02.756 --> 01:04:04.883
He'll never give up.

01:04:29.115 --> 01:04:30.992
Oh, my gosh!

01:05:06.528 --> 01:05:08.780
Uh... Excuse me.

01:05:11.074 --> 01:05:14.326
Look, I've got a long way to go,
you're going to take me there,

01:05:14.327 --> 01:05:17.371
and you're not going to
give me any trouble, right?

01:05:20.667 --> 01:05:22.339
Good.

01:05:23.962 --> 01:05:25.839
Now, get!

01:05:46.234 --> 01:05:47.693
Are you ready, boy?

01:05:47.694 --> 01:05:52.165
It's time you learned
how to fish for crocs!

01:05:52.574 --> 01:05:56.499
They like it when you use live bait.

01:05:56.744 --> 01:05:59.698
And you're as live as they come.

01:06:02.834 --> 01:06:04.084
Oh!

01:06:04.085 --> 01:06:08.806
<i>You get a line
And I'll get a pole, matey</i>

01:06:09.048 --> 01:06:12.718
<i>You get a line
I'll get a pole, friend</i>

01:06:12.719 --> 01:06:17.473
<i>Oh, you get a line, I'll get a pole
We'll go fishing in the crocodile hole</i>

01:06:17.474 --> 01:06:21.353
<i>Buddy, pal of mine</i>

01:06:22.270 --> 01:06:25.865
That's right, babies. Suppertime!

01:06:34.407 --> 01:06:37.910
It don't look good, Miss B. I can't
see any way out of this one.

01:06:37.911 --> 01:06:41.415
Bernard, please hurry!

01:06:43.833 --> 01:06:47.132
Now, this is my idea of fun.

01:06:50.131 --> 01:06:54.885
Nothing personal, boy, but I wouldn't
want to disappoint the rangers.

01:06:54.886 --> 01:06:57.262
They was looking so hard for you,

01:06:57.263 --> 01:07:00.391
and now they're gonna find you!

01:07:05.605 --> 01:07:07.856
What the blaze is going on here?

01:07:12.779 --> 01:07:15.281
Joanna.

01:07:16.115 --> 01:07:21.578
Did you know there was a
razorback in my truck? Did ya?

01:07:21.579 --> 01:07:24.002
There was a razorback in my truck!

01:07:24.123 --> 01:07:29.049
Now you quit playing around and do
your job, you four-legged python!

01:07:33.508 --> 01:07:35.976
Hey, what happened to them keys?

01:07:36.594 --> 01:07:38.095
Must be around here somewhere.

01:07:38.096 --> 01:07:41.145
They couldn't just get
up and walk away.

01:07:42.976 --> 01:07:48.403
Something weird's going on
around here. I smell a big, fat rat.

01:08:05.540 --> 01:08:08.250
- Look, it's Bernard!
- I don't believe it!

01:08:08.251 --> 01:08:12.346
- Way to go, mate!
- Miss Bianca, Jake, catch!

01:08:21.973 --> 01:08:25.434
Well, there's more than
one way to skin a cat.

01:08:48.124 --> 01:08:50.376
Blast!

01:08:51.085 --> 01:08:55.135
Oh, my gosh! I hope I
know what I'm doing.

01:09:10.729 --> 01:09:13.189
Hey, get off me!

01:09:13.191 --> 01:09:16.109
Whoa! Whoa!

01:09:24.035 --> 01:09:26.662
Joanna! Joanna!

01:09:26.662 --> 01:09:29.622
You stupid lizard! Get off me!

01:09:29.624 --> 01:09:31.567
You idiot!

01:09:32.167 --> 01:09:34.545
Get off of me!

01:09:36.506 --> 01:09:39.100
No! No!

01:09:45.473 --> 01:09:47.645
Bernard, the boy!

01:10:02.281 --> 01:10:04.203
Help!

01:10:06.452 --> 01:10:08.454
Help!

01:10:13.209 --> 01:10:14.926
Get back!

01:10:16.129 --> 01:10:19.178
Get away. Get away!

01:10:19.298 --> 01:10:23.135
I whooped you! I whooped you all!

01:10:23.136 --> 01:10:27.639
You'll think twice before messing
with Percival C. McLeach!

01:10:38.818 --> 01:10:41.491
No!

01:10:50.163 --> 01:10:52.006
Don't give up, Cody!

01:10:52.457 --> 01:10:54.174
There!

01:10:55.084 --> 01:10:56.882
Hop on, Miss B!

01:11:00.173 --> 01:11:02.892
Help! Help!

01:11:33.873 --> 01:11:35.670
It's okay.

01:11:35.708 --> 01:11:37.881
Come on.

01:11:39.587 --> 01:11:41.555
Thanks, little mate.

01:11:44.842 --> 01:11:51.014
Oh, Bernard, you are magnificent.
You are absolutely the hero of the day.

01:11:51.015 --> 01:11:54.735
Miss Bianca, before
anything else happens,

01:11:56.354 --> 01:11:59.147
- will you marry me?
- Bernard.

01:11:59.148 --> 01:12:02.151
Of course, I will!

01:12:03.152 --> 01:12:04.945
Well done, mate.

01:12:04.946 --> 01:12:09.246
Come on, Marahute, let's all go home.

01:12:31.013 --> 01:12:32.180
Help!

01:12:32.181 --> 01:12:34.099
Anybody!

01:12:34.100 --> 01:12:36.101
Bernard!

01:12:36.102 --> 01:12:38.144
Bianca!

01:12:38.145 --> 01:12:40.856
Where are you?

01:12:40.857 --> 01:12:44.150
Okay, that's it, I'm out of here.
This is ridiculous.

01:12:44.151 --> 01:12:46.611
You can't leave me here alone.

01:12:46.612 --> 01:12:48.697
I'm gone! I am gone.

01:12:50.992 --> 01:12:54.996
No, stay in those eggs!
That's a direct order!

01:12:55.413 --> 01:12:57.455
Oh.

01:12:57.456 --> 01:13:02.210
Hey, you're kind of a cute
little feller. Coochy, coochy...
