[instrumental music]

00:05.506 --> 00:08.040
- Manure.
- What?

00:08.042 --> 00:10.509
Add manure to your grocery list.

00:11.479 --> 00:13.078
Why?

00:13.080 --> 00:14.613
So you won't forget it.

00:14.615 --> 00:18.917
I mean, why do you
want...manure?

00:18.919 --> 00:22.388
To spread on my...carrots.

00:22.390 --> 00:24.857
Use butter, like everybody else.

00:26.193 --> 00:28.727
No, it's for my garden.

00:28.729 --> 00:31.196
My crops aren't
doing very well.

00:31.198 --> 00:35.768
I forgot to prime the soil
with manure before I planted.

00:36.904 --> 00:38.570
Oh, isn't it too late for that?

00:38.572 --> 00:41.507
It's never too late for manure.

00:42.643 --> 00:45.411
That would make
a nice bumper sticker.

00:45.413 --> 00:47.713
If this works out,
I may expand.

00:48.516 --> 00:51.316
Maybe plant some cotton..

00:51.318 --> 00:53.318
...or, in the winter, wool.

00:54.755 --> 00:57.689
Expand? You've already
torn up the whole backyard.

00:57.691 --> 00:59.324
I can't help it.

00:59.326 --> 01:02.261
I mean, I'm really
into this gardening thing.

01:02.263 --> 01:05.230
I love spending time
in the sun..

01:05.232 --> 01:06.832
...feeling the earth..

01:06.834 --> 01:09.935
...nurturing new life
from the soil.

01:09.937 --> 01:12.404
Well, I'm glad you enjoy it.

01:12.406 --> 01:14.673
I also like eating the bugs.

[reading in foreign language]

02:30.151 --> 02:32.017
What? You speak English?

02:33.154 --> 02:34.786
Why didn't you say so?

02:34.788 --> 02:37.356
No, I don't think
that's funny.

02:37.358 --> 02:39.458
Never mind, uh,
I'm with, I'm with

02:39.460 --> 02:41.760
the Social Services Department
of Los Angeles County.

02:41.762 --> 02:44.830
I'm trying to find a man
named Fredo Mancia.

02:44.832 --> 02:48.100
He's a farmer,
he-he-he lives near San Felipe.

02:48.102 --> 02:50.202
I-I've got his son here.

02:50.204 --> 02:51.537
Yes, I'll hold.

02:51.539 --> 02:53.071
Uh, those-those are my kids.

02:53.073 --> 02:57.109
Uh, uh,<i> ninos. </i>
Uh, Br-Brian and Lynn.

02:57.111 --> 02:58.610
Lynn.

03:00.548 --> 03:01.914
- Can I go home now?
- No.

03:01.916 --> 03:05.751
Uh, Lynn is, uh, uh, 17,
Brian is, uh,<i> siete.</i>

03:05.753 --> 03:07.286
- Goodnight.
- Goodnight, Scott.

03:07.288 --> 03:09.154
Why can't I go home?
Everybody else is going home.

03:09.156 --> 03:11.590
Well, Ms. Wine, I'm sorry
this is taking so long

03:11.592 --> 03:13.825
but we're trying
to help this boy.

03:13.827 --> 03:15.360
He's alone, he's frightened

03:15.362 --> 03:17.362
he doesn't speak any English

03:17.364 --> 03:20.032
and if I'm gonna put him
alone on a bus back to Mexico

03:20.034 --> 03:22.601
I wanna be sure there's gonna
be somebody there to meet him.

03:22.603 --> 03:24.303
In other words, you don't care
what traffic's like

03:24.305 --> 03:26.572
this time of night.

03:26.574 --> 03:29.341
Listen, why don't you, why don't
you go downstairs, get..

03:29.343 --> 03:30.909
See if you can
get him a soda.

03:30.911 --> 03:32.811
Sure, then why don't I take him
to the basketball game?

03:32.813 --> 03:35.147
Oh, why don't you take him
to the roller derby?

03:35.149 --> 03:36.982
He could watch you play.

03:36.984 --> 03:38.984
The pop machine
takes two quarters.

03:40.421 --> 03:42.254
You know, this job
is not my whole life.

03:42.256 --> 03:45.824
In case you care, my life starts
when I walk out that door.

03:45.826 --> 03:49.061
Mine perks up
at exactly the same moment.

03:50.664 --> 03:54.399
Yes, I'm here.
I-I-I'm here. I'm still holding.

03:54.401 --> 03:56.368
Uh, why is that funny?

03:56.370 --> 03:58.637
Never mind, just hurry,
please, please.

03:58.639 --> 04:00.606
Tanner, unless that boy
is now in our employ

04:00.608 --> 04:02.741
I wanna know
why he's still here.

04:02.743 --> 04:05.811
Uh, Warren, I'm on the phone
with, uh, San Felipe.

04:05.813 --> 04:07.613
- I'm-I'm just about to--
- Waste of time.

04:07.615 --> 04:09.982
Just call the Youth Authority,
they'll have him picked up.

04:09.984 --> 04:11.917
They'll put him
on the 6 o'clock bus for home.

04:11.919 --> 04:14.419
I'm gonna have this
whole thing straightened out

04:14.421 --> 04:16.588
in exactly one minute.

04:16.590 --> 04:19.157
Just wrap it up now and move on.

04:19.159 --> 04:20.259
'Yes, I'm still here.'

04:20.261 --> 04:21.593
Ha-have you found anyone
who knows

04:21.595 --> 04:23.595
uh, anything about
Fredo Mancia?

04:23.597 --> 04:25.764
You have? Great.

04:25.766 --> 04:27.766
He's gone? Gone where?

04:29.370 --> 04:31.103
Well, somebody must..

04:31.105 --> 04:33.238
I'm s..

04:33.240 --> 04:34.706
I'm sorry too.

04:34.708 --> 04:36.441
[instrumental music]

04:36.443 --> 04:38.443
It's a deal.

04:38.445 --> 04:39.878
Good news, Kate.

04:39.880 --> 04:43.515
- I just saved us five bucks.
- How?

04:43.517 --> 04:45.183
I ordered the manure
by the truckload.

04:46.687 --> 04:49.655
That's exactly
how you'll send it back.

04:49.657 --> 04:52.591
Here, ALF. I have to go back
for the onions.

04:52.593 --> 04:54.760
Wait, wait.
Is this all we've got?

04:56.430 --> 04:58.764
We should have used
more manure.

04:58.766 --> 05:01.366
Great. Dust Bowl '87.

05:01.368 --> 05:02.401
(Kate)
'Well, what's wrong?'

05:02.403 --> 05:03.535
There are not many of them

05:03.537 --> 05:06.571
but they're
perfectly fine yams.

05:06.573 --> 05:08.140
Mom, that's eggplant.

05:08.142 --> 05:09.975
It's corn!

05:11.412 --> 05:12.978
You know, it's really weird.

05:12.980 --> 05:14.646
None of the other plants
will grow

05:14.648 --> 05:17.516
but we have enough zucchini
to fill a warehouse.

05:17.518 --> 05:19.151
It's weirder than you think.

05:19.153 --> 05:21.753
I didn't plant zucchini.

05:21.755 --> 05:23.689
Oh, I'm sure things
will get better, ALF.

05:23.691 --> 05:25.057
Gardening's tougher
than it looks.

05:25.059 --> 05:27.592
Yeah? Well, it'd be
a heck of a lot easier

05:27.594 --> 05:30.562
if it weren't for Bob Barker.

05:30.564 --> 05:32.864
- Bob Barker?
- Yeah.

05:32.866 --> 05:37.069
He comes into my garden at night
and digs up the plants.

05:37.071 --> 05:38.470
The game show host?

05:38.472 --> 05:42.374
[chuckles]
Mom, Bob Barker
is the Ochmoneks' dog.

05:42.376 --> 05:44.843
Oh, the Chihuahua.

05:44.845 --> 05:47.045
Are Chihuahuas fast?

05:47.047 --> 05:48.080
[thud]

05:49.450 --> 05:51.550
ALF, put that claw down.

05:51.552 --> 05:53.752
Fine. I'll use quicksand.

05:58.192 --> 05:59.224
[telephone ringing]

05:59.226 --> 06:01.159
I'll get it.

06:01.161 --> 06:02.194
Hello?

06:02.196 --> 06:04.529
ALF, put Kate on.

06:04.531 --> 06:06.932
Hey, Kate.
I'm the King of France.

06:09.103 --> 06:12.871
Never mind.
I-I'm going to be a little late.

06:12.873 --> 06:14.172
Fine.

06:16.110 --> 06:20.712
- Who was that?
- Sounded like Willie.

06:20.714 --> 06:24.015
- What did he say?
- He said he was gonna be late.

06:24.017 --> 06:27.452
- Did he say why?
- What am I, the desk clerk?

06:27.454 --> 06:29.654
[telephone ringing]

06:29.656 --> 06:31.623
Hotel Tanner.

06:31.625 --> 06:33.825
Oh, hey, we were
just talking about you.

06:34.928 --> 06:38.663
Don't hang up.
I have to talk to Kate.

06:38.665 --> 06:40.265
There's something
I have to tell her.

06:40.267 --> 06:42.934
Hey, is this about
why you can't come home?

06:42.936 --> 06:45.437
Are you hiding something?

06:45.439 --> 06:47.239
You got a little chippy
on the side?

06:49.109 --> 06:52.744
I'm taking a Mexican boy
to catch his bus.

06:52.746 --> 06:54.212
Oh, that's original.

06:54.214 --> 06:56.348
Kate, you gotta hear this.
Pick up.

06:58.185 --> 06:59.751
Honey, what's the problem?

06:59.753 --> 07:01.853
Uh, there's a boy here
who's got to get back to Mexico.

07:01.855 --> 07:03.755
I can't, I can't
reach his family

07:03.757 --> 07:05.457
I don't wanna just abandon him

07:05.459 --> 07:08.260
so I-I'm gonna take him down
and put him on the bus myself.

07:08.262 --> 07:10.896
- Well, I understand, honey.
- Kate, you're buying that?

07:10.898 --> 07:13.031
Why are you still on the phone?

07:13.033 --> 07:15.233
- Hang up.
- In a second.

07:15.235 --> 07:18.770
I want to hear the joke
about the kid with no family.

07:18.772 --> 07:20.172
This is not a joke.

07:20.174 --> 07:23.208
Th-the boy has a family.
He has a father.

07:23.210 --> 07:25.343
I just..
I can't find him. That's..

07:25.345 --> 07:26.945
Why am I talking to you?

07:26.947 --> 07:28.847
I don't know. You called.

07:29.883 --> 07:31.683
Kate, I'll be home
a little later.

07:31.685 --> 07:33.552
Okay? Bye-bye.

07:33.554 --> 07:34.853
Goodbye, honey.

07:34.855 --> 07:36.655
Hey, hey, Willie,
there's one thing

07:36.657 --> 07:39.090
I'm still not clear about.

07:39.092 --> 07:42.427
Are you or are you not
getting some action on the side?

07:42.429 --> 07:43.995
Oh.

07:43.997 --> 07:45.163
Hello?

07:48.902 --> 07:50.902
He's probably not.

07:53.273 --> 07:55.841
Whoa! Don't give him those!

07:55.843 --> 07:57.242
I'm telling you, Brian

07:57.244 --> 08:00.278
the three-point shot
is ruining this game.

08:02.082 --> 08:03.882
Dad, wanna watch the game
with us?

08:03.884 --> 08:06.618
No. ALF...go in the kitchen.

08:06.620 --> 08:08.687
I can't.
I've got money on this game.

08:08.689 --> 08:10.121
You can read
about the game tomorrow..

08:10.123 --> 08:13.158
Y-you bet on basketball games?

08:13.160 --> 08:16.761
Just college.
Only a fool bets on the pros.

08:18.432 --> 08:21.433
Hey, Kate, you owe me
for the Celtics game.

08:21.435 --> 08:22.968
Kate.

08:22.970 --> 08:25.337
I thought the Celtics
were a lock.

08:25.339 --> 08:28.039
Bird was out,
McHale had a sprained ankle.

08:28.041 --> 08:30.909
Uh, could you just.. Could you
set another plate for supper?

08:30.911 --> 08:33.445
- Well, o-of course, but--
- ALF, go!

08:33.447 --> 08:34.579
- Hi, dad.
- Ugh!

08:34.581 --> 08:36.081
How come you're home so soon?

08:36.083 --> 08:40.118
Well, it appears that...
somebody missed his bus.

08:44.825 --> 08:46.191
<i> Hola.</i>

08:50.964 --> 08:54.065
Everybody,
this is Luis Mancia.

08:54.067 --> 08:56.968
Luis, this is, uh, everybody.

08:56.970 --> 08:59.704
This is Kate, uh,
this is<i> Senora</i> Tanner.

08:59.706 --> 09:01.740
- Uh, this is--
- Lynn.

09:01.742 --> 09:03.208
Have we met?

09:03.210 --> 09:05.644
He saw your picture.
Your school picture on my desk.

09:05.646 --> 09:07.345
Oh, dad, you know
I hate that picture.

09:07.347 --> 09:08.914
I wish you wouldn't
show it to people.

09:08.916 --> 09:10.749
Well, what-what's
the matter with it?

09:10.751 --> 09:13.318
I look like
the village idiot.

09:13.320 --> 09:15.754
Honey, you don't look anything
like the village idiot.

09:15.756 --> 09:17.322
People, people.

09:17.324 --> 09:19.591
[clears throat]
Luis, this is Brian.

09:19.593 --> 09:20.825
Hi!

09:20.827 --> 09:22.794
Luis, it's very good
to have you here.

09:22.796 --> 09:25.263
Luis doesn't speak
any English, Kate.

09:25.265 --> 09:29.301
<i> - Mi casa su casa.</i>
<i> - Gracias.</i>

09:29.303 --> 09:31.870
Luis is gonna
stay over here tonight.

09:31.872 --> 09:33.538
Great, he can have my room

09:33.540 --> 09:35.240
and I'll sleep
in the laundry room with--

09:35.242 --> 09:36.675
Brian.

09:36.677 --> 09:39.210
[whispers]
A-L-F.

09:39.212 --> 09:42.013
I think, uh, the couch will be
fine. I think..

09:42.015 --> 09:43.481
[whispers]
A-L-F

09:43.483 --> 09:44.883
can sleep in the garage.

09:44.885 --> 09:46.217
(ALF)
'Whoopee.'

09:48.488 --> 09:49.788
Brian, why don't
you show Luis

09:49.790 --> 09:52.390
where he can, uh,
wash up for dinner?

09:53.727 --> 09:55.694
Okay.

09:55.696 --> 09:57.395
Come on, Luis.

10:02.703 --> 10:05.070
Well, uh..

10:05.072 --> 10:07.973
...something tells me that, uh,
nobody knows he's here, do they?

10:07.975 --> 10:10.809
- Not exactly.
- You stole a kid?

10:10.811 --> 10:12.210
I borrowed one.

10:12.212 --> 10:15.413
Just for 24 hours,
just until I can find his dad.

10:15.415 --> 10:18.750
- Honey, what happened?
- I honestly don't know, Kate.

10:18.752 --> 10:21.653
I was at the last stop light
right before the bus station

10:21.655 --> 10:24.389
and instead of turning right,
I turned left onto third

10:24.391 --> 10:30.462
and I sort of got on the freeway
and then I sort of came home.

10:30.464 --> 10:33.832
I thought you couldn't turn left
on third. It's one-way.

10:33.834 --> 10:35.367
Well, not after 4 o'clock.

10:35.369 --> 10:39.237
ALF, why.. What difference
does it make to you?

10:39.239 --> 10:41.172
What difference does it make?

10:41.174 --> 10:43.908
Hah! I'm not driving
with you anymore.

10:46.680 --> 10:48.847
[slurping]

10:50.550 --> 10:51.816
[snaps fingers]

10:51.818 --> 10:54.552
[burps]
I'll get the rest of that later.

10:56.456 --> 10:58.490
[instrumental music]

11:25.652 --> 11:27.552
[door closes]

13:07.721 --> 13:09.087
Never mind.

13:10.423 --> 13:12.390
I knew I heard something.
Look, he's gone.

13:12.392 --> 13:15.860
Oh, no, I hope
he didn't run away.

13:15.862 --> 13:18.429

he knew Spanish.

14:05.912 --> 14:08.680

to French.

- Oh.

14:27.100 --> 14:29.801
Thank you, thank you
for your help.

14:29.803 --> 14:31.436
<i> Gracias.</i>

14:31.438 --> 14:33.605
I've tried
every agency in Mexico

14:33.607 --> 14:36.441
that might be able
to find Fredo Mancia.

14:36.443 --> 14:38.343
You sure you don't
wanna waste any more time?

14:38.345 --> 14:40.812
I mean, so far I've only missed
my break and my lunch.

14:40.814 --> 14:42.447
I bought you your lunch.

14:42.449 --> 14:44.515
Oh, many thanks
for the hot dog.

14:44.517 --> 14:47.051
Remind me to have a kid
so I can name him after you.

14:47.053 --> 14:49.520
Don't reproduce on my account.

14:50.390 --> 14:52.557
Maybe I should never leave.

14:52.559 --> 14:53.958
Maybe I should sleep here
at night too.

14:53.960 --> 14:55.326
That's a good idea.

14:55.328 --> 14:57.929
We wouldn't need
the Doberman pinschers.

14:57.931 --> 15:00.064
I don't know
why I'm helping you.

15:00.066 --> 15:02.700
Just watch. We'll get caught,
and I'll take the fall.

15:02.702 --> 15:04.869
Ms. Wine..

15:04.871 --> 15:09.207
...I truly hate to compromise
your high moral position..

15:09.209 --> 15:10.842
...but if you think
this boy doesn't deserve

15:10.844 --> 15:13.378
our help, then go!

15:13.380 --> 15:15.346
Tanner.

15:15.348 --> 15:17.548
Just heard a funny story.

15:17.550 --> 15:21.653
Seems your, uh, Mexican kid
missed his bus yesterday.

15:21.655 --> 15:24.789
That's the kind of thing
that can cost somebody his job.

15:24.791 --> 15:26.591
That is a funny story.

15:26.593 --> 15:29.527
Hey, I'm a fair man,
right, Tanner?

15:30.964 --> 15:33.164
- Um--
- Well, I used to be.

15:34.267 --> 15:36.000
Well, I can be.

15:36.002 --> 15:39.103
For now, I'll assume
this is a clerical error.

15:39.105 --> 15:41.773
Told you I'd take the rap.

15:41.775 --> 15:44.142
Right now it's 5:30.

15:44.144 --> 15:46.311
If your kid misses today's bus

15:46.313 --> 15:48.579
I promise you an investigation.

15:48.581 --> 15:50.281
Thank you.
Hold, please.

15:50.283 --> 15:51.382
Unless I need a note
from my mother

15:51.384 --> 15:52.984
I'm going to the ladies' room.

15:52.986 --> 15:55.787
- Pick up line one.
- I-I can't take any calls.

15:55.789 --> 15:58.222
You're not taking,
you're placing.

15:58.224 --> 16:00.725
An old boyfriend of mine,
whom I now hate

16:00.727 --> 16:02.593
lives in Cuernavaca
and he sells equipment

16:02.595 --> 16:04.262
to all the farmers around there.

16:04.264 --> 16:07.065
If anybody will know
about this Mancia guy, he will.

16:07.067 --> 16:08.933
I, I don't know
how to thank you.

16:08.935 --> 16:11.436
Just try not to embarrass
the whole country.

16:12.672 --> 16:16.341
And tell him
I want my albums back.

16:16.343 --> 16:18.977
Uh, hello.
You-you don't know me.

16:18.979 --> 16:21.713
Uh, my name is Willie Tanner.
I'm in Los Angeles.

16:21.715 --> 16:24.649
I'm trying to locate a farmer
named Fredo Mancia.

16:24.651 --> 16:28.886
They told me he moved..
He-he what?

16:28.888 --> 16:31.322
[instrumental music]

16:31.324 --> 16:34.092
Hey, guys.
How about a little break?

16:34.094 --> 16:36.427
Brian, get out
the Slip 'N Slide.

16:37.831 --> 16:40.365
Not yet. We're not done.

16:40.367 --> 16:42.066
I've been thinking.

16:42.068 --> 16:43.735
Isn't there
some government program

16:43.737 --> 16:45.937
that pays you<i> not</i> to grow crops?

16:47.007 --> 16:48.973
Weeds.<i> Mala hierba.</i>

16:51.144 --> 16:54.178
Weeds.<i> Mala hierba.</i>

16:54.180 --> 16:57.081
Hey, hey!
Hold it, hold it.

16:57.083 --> 16:58.816
These aren't weeds.

16:58.818 --> 17:00.818
I think it's my spinach.

17:02.856 --> 17:05.289
Weeds.<i> Mala hierba.</i>

17:06.092 --> 17:07.725
Hmm?

17:07.727 --> 17:10.828
I better tell your mom
to hold off on that salad.

17:12.599 --> 17:14.932
[sighs]
Mom, be honest, okay?

17:14.934 --> 17:18.102
How much longer
do we have to eat zucchini?

17:18.104 --> 17:21.706
Well, assuming you take some
when you go away to college..

17:23.309 --> 17:25.510
- Hi, honey.
- 'Hi.'

17:25.512 --> 17:27.612
Well, what-what happened
with Luis' father?

17:27.614 --> 17:29.347
- We've been waiting to hear.
- I know.

17:29.349 --> 17:31.549
Lynn, uh, go get Luis, will you?

17:31.551 --> 17:33.351
Sure. He's in ALF's garden.

17:33.353 --> 17:36.220
Oh, you didn't find him,
did you?

17:36.222 --> 17:38.322
Yes, I did.

17:38.324 --> 17:41.025
Well, that's wonderful.
How?

17:41.027 --> 17:43.895
Uh, Ms. Wine, uh,
contacted an old boyfriend

17:43.897 --> 17:46.697
she had in Mexico
and he-he knew.

17:47.634 --> 17:49.367
I'm amazed.

17:49.369 --> 17:52.103
No, she helps me sometimes.

17:52.105 --> 17:54.272
No, I'm amazed
she had a boyfriend.

17:56.409 --> 17:57.608
Dad, what happened?

17:57.610 --> 18:00.511
Your dad found Luis' father.

18:01.414 --> 18:03.047
Where'd you find him, dad?

18:03.049 --> 18:06.617
Uh, I think we should let
Luis answer that question.

18:07.821 --> 18:09.120
What?

18:09.122 --> 18:10.521
You better tell him.

18:10.523 --> 18:14.025
<i> No, no! No comprendo!</i>
<i> No comprendo!</i>

18:14.027 --> 18:15.426
You<i> comprende.</i>

18:15.428 --> 18:18.062
Come on, it's time
to come clean.

18:19.432 --> 18:22.300
Luis. Come here.

18:30.410 --> 18:32.477
My dad is in Riverside.

18:33.947 --> 18:36.814
He has a job
in a carpet factory.

18:36.816 --> 18:38.516
You speak English?

18:38.518 --> 18:42.453
It's hard to fake words
like "Carpet factory."

18:43.556 --> 18:46.090
Luis' father
had a farm in Mexico

18:46.092 --> 18:48.326
and when it went under,
he got a work permit

18:48.328 --> 18:50.361
and he moved to Riverside.

18:50.363 --> 18:52.930
Luis, I've-I've spoken
to your father.

18:52.932 --> 18:55.666
He's-he's so happy to hear
that you're safe.

18:55.668 --> 18:57.568
He's on his way over here now
to pick you up.

18:57.570 --> 19:01.639
No! He'll make me stay.
You ruined it!

19:01.641 --> 19:03.441
I almost
got to go home on a bus

19:03.443 --> 19:05.710
but you ruined everything!

19:05.712 --> 19:08.446
Luis, you want to go back?

19:08.448 --> 19:11.349
Yes, my friends are there

19:11.351 --> 19:13.885
I can work,
I have a place to live.

19:14.554 --> 19:15.953
I don't wanna stay here.

19:15.955 --> 19:18.422
But, Luis, your father
wants you here.

19:18.424 --> 19:20.525
You can't make me stay!

19:22.128 --> 19:23.995
Luis.

19:23.997 --> 19:25.029
If I may interject here--

19:25.031 --> 19:27.698
I think that I'm capable
of handling this.

19:27.700 --> 19:30.168
This is my job, you know.

19:30.170 --> 19:31.402
Come on, Willie.

19:31.404 --> 19:32.937
He's not gonna
listen to you.

19:32.939 --> 19:35.573
You're the one
who found his father.

19:35.575 --> 19:38.409
Do you think you can
handle this any better?

19:39.212 --> 19:41.512
Well, maybe.

19:41.514 --> 19:44.382
Luis and I
have become very close.

19:45.418 --> 19:47.652
- We've tilled together.
- Alright.

19:47.654 --> 19:49.453
- We've mulched.
- I know.

19:49.455 --> 19:51.355
- We've hoed.
- Alright.

19:51.357 --> 19:53.491
- We've sprinkled.
- 'Alright!'

19:53.493 --> 19:56.561
Alright. Talk. Talk.

19:58.364 --> 20:01.098
In private, please.

20:01.100 --> 20:04.635
Well, shall we all go
and sit out on the front porch?

20:05.438 --> 20:08.239
Well, it is a nice day.

20:08.241 --> 20:13.077
ALF, maybe you and Luis
could go into the kitchen.

20:13.079 --> 20:16.814
Come on, Luis.
Let's go for a little..

20:16.816 --> 20:19.684
How do you say
confab in Spanish?

20:19.686 --> 20:21.619
- Confab.
- Huh!

20:24.357 --> 20:27.758
So, otherwise
how was your day?

20:30.997 --> 20:33.798
ALF, you have to help me.
I gotta get out of here.

20:33.800 --> 20:37.969
Calm down. Take a seat.
Let's talk.

20:37.971 --> 20:40.438
I don't wanna sit down!
I wanna get out!

20:40.440 --> 20:42.640
I wanna get away!

20:42.642 --> 20:44.842
Luis, let me ask you something.

20:44.844 --> 20:47.845
You came here when? November?

20:47.847 --> 20:49.714
November 28.

20:49.716 --> 20:52.817
Well, I've been here
a lot longer than that

20:52.819 --> 20:55.653
and I'm still
getting used to it.

20:55.655 --> 20:58.656
You have to give
the place a chance.

20:58.658 --> 21:01.092
But I don't know anybody here.

21:01.094 --> 21:05.296
You know me.
We became friends right away.

21:05.298 --> 21:08.232
You tried to hit me with a hoe.

21:08.234 --> 21:10.501
Alright, it was a rocky start.

21:11.371 --> 21:13.904
But, but we tilled together..

21:15.341 --> 21:16.807
...we mulched..

21:16.809 --> 21:19.777
...we hoed...we sprinkled..

21:19.779 --> 21:20.978
Alright!

21:24.150 --> 21:28.052
But...I don't know
how to figure things out.

21:28.054 --> 21:30.921
Ah, you pick it up
here and there.

21:30.923 --> 21:33.224
What you don't know,
you guess at.

21:33.226 --> 21:36.127
I still haven't figured out
the words to "Louie Louie."

21:36.129 --> 21:38.462
- Have you?
- Yes.

21:38.464 --> 21:41.632
Well, see?
You're one up on me already. Ha!

21:43.036 --> 21:46.037
If I stay in Riverside,
will you come and visit?

21:46.973 --> 21:50.107
Probably not.
But, hey!

21:50.109 --> 21:52.109
There's no reason
why you can't drop by here

21:52.111 --> 21:54.645
once in a while
and visit me.

21:54.647 --> 21:56.247
Although, call first.

21:56.249 --> 21:58.115
I may be in the shower.

21:59.319 --> 22:01.619
Luis, your father's here.

22:03.022 --> 22:06.090
Well, you comin' over
next Sunday or not?

22:06.092 --> 22:08.993
You can help me
harvest the jicama.

22:08.995 --> 22:10.394
I hate jicama.

22:10.396 --> 22:12.463
So don't eat.

22:12.465 --> 22:14.699
I like hamburgers.

22:15.568 --> 22:17.601
Then bring the mustard.

22:17.603 --> 22:19.737
No<i> problema.</i>

22:19.739 --> 22:22.139
And don't forget
our little secret.

22:22.141 --> 22:24.375
I don't exist.

22:24.377 --> 22:26.177
Who'd believe me?

22:27.213 --> 22:29.013
Thanks.

22:29.015 --> 22:31.015
<i> Hasta la vista.</i>

22:35.655 --> 22:38.356
I'm sorry, Mr. Tanner.

22:38.358 --> 22:40.691
- Thanks.
- No problem.

22:40.693 --> 22:43.961
Oh, Luis...before you go

22:43.963 --> 22:46.130
could I ask you
a big, big favor?

22:46.132 --> 22:47.198
Sure.

22:47.200 --> 22:50.701
Will you take
some zucchini, please?

22:50.703 --> 22:52.703
I didn't plant zucchini.

22:53.673 --> 22:56.807
[instrumental music]

23:02.548 --> 23:05.116
[video game beeping]

23:05.118 --> 23:08.819
Go. Yeah.

23:08.821 --> 23:11.255
ALF, we have to talk.

23:11.257 --> 23:12.823
Just a second.

23:13.693 --> 23:15.659
Easy shot! Hah!

23:15.661 --> 23:18.696
That's exactly why
the Martians are extinct.

23:19.265 --> 23:20.798
What is this?

23:20.800 --> 23:22.767
"Space Invaders."

23:22.769 --> 23:24.635
What do they do?
Crash into your garage?

23:24.637 --> 23:26.670
Eat all your food?
Dig up your yard?

23:26.672 --> 23:29.240
You're in a mood.

23:29.242 --> 23:31.609
Yes, I am.

23:31.611 --> 23:35.246
Because I found my good hoe
in this condition.

23:36.082 --> 23:38.282
Oh, yeah. Sorry.

23:38.284 --> 23:39.617
I was plowing up my garden

23:39.619 --> 23:41.352
and I hit a water main.

23:42.388 --> 23:45.122
Don't worry. It wasn't yours.

23:46.659 --> 23:48.726
So you're giving up gardening?

23:48.728 --> 23:51.962
Not giving it up.
