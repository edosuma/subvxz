00:32.344 --> 00:34.724
Thank you so much for
helping with the build, Dad.

00:34.827 --> 00:36.379
Yeah, when you dangled
bacon in front of me

00:36.482 --> 00:37.862
until my eyes went crossed,

00:37.965 --> 00:40.310
I had no earthly idea
what I'd signed up for.

00:40.413 --> 00:41.551
Well, we couldn't build all this

00:41.655 --> 00:43.310
for the horse rescue
without you.

00:43.413 --> 00:44.655
You've got more experience than
the both of us combined.

00:44.758 --> 00:46.551
That was real sweet of you
to say, sis.

00:46.655 --> 00:47.931
I mean, I love it

00:48.034 --> 00:50.034
when my expertise is
acknowledged, really.

00:50.137 --> 00:51.724
Oh, August, that's a good joke.

00:51.827 --> 00:53.724
Been funnier
if you hadn't oversold it.

00:53.827 --> 00:56.275
Like, "That's sweet of you
to say, sis."

00:56.379 --> 00:59.965
See? Sweet, simple,
clean, funny.

01:00.068 --> 01:02.103
I don't know, I think I like it
better the way he did it.

01:02.206 --> 01:03.551
Just kind of went on and on.

01:03.655 --> 01:05.482
Watch-- Hey, Stella,
can you set me up again

01:05.586 --> 01:07.689
with the line that you said
to your grandad?

01:07.793 --> 01:09.344
What is going on here?

01:09.448 --> 01:11.379
Go ahead, show them a thing
or two about comedic timing.

01:11.482 --> 01:13.689
When Mawline was your age
she was the star

01:13.793 --> 01:14.724
of a comedy troupe.

01:14.827 --> 01:16.068
That's sweet of you to say, sis.

01:16.172 --> 01:17.689
And that's what's known
as a callback.

01:17.793 --> 01:19.517
Okay, how am I just
finding out about this?

01:19.620 --> 01:21.448
Can we focus on
building the stables?

01:21.551 --> 01:24.413
We can't board the rescues
at the Davidson Ranch anymore.

01:24.517 --> 01:27.517
Colton said
their stables are packed.

01:28.344 --> 01:31.448
What's this? Cordell send
someone over to help

01:31.551 --> 01:33.000
because he's too busy today?

01:33.103 --> 01:34.620
Too busy today,
too busy every day.

01:34.724 --> 01:35.793
For weeks.

01:35.896 --> 01:36.965
Howdy there, Walkers.

01:37.793 --> 01:39.620
Heard you could use
an extra hand.

01:39.724 --> 01:41.068
I invited Kevin.

01:41.172 --> 01:42.793
Well, he-he kind of asked

01:42.896 --> 01:45.620
to help after he hooked us up
with the horse donor lady.

01:45.724 --> 01:47.137
Uh, Georgia May
of Happy Horse Farms

01:47.241 --> 01:49.000
is not a mere
horse donor lady, Augie.

01:49.103 --> 01:50.655
She happens to be

01:50.758 --> 01:52.655
one of the most influential
philanthropists in all of Texas.

01:52.758 --> 01:54.275
She also happens to see

01:54.379 --> 01:56.275
a lot of potential
in your horse rescue,

01:56.379 --> 01:57.965
as do I, which is why I'm here.

01:58.068 --> 01:59.448
You didn't have to
do that, Kevin.

01:59.551 --> 02:00.758
I know how busy you are

02:00.862 --> 02:02.206
at the mayor's office,
but thank you.

02:02.310 --> 02:03.379
Oh, no, honestly.

02:03.482 --> 02:04.620
Helping at a grassroots level

02:04.724 --> 02:06.344
is what I really love anyway.

02:06.448 --> 02:10.448
Although, Georgia did show me
your timeline to launch.

02:10.551 --> 02:13.517
Yikes. Not exactly
what she had in mind.

02:13.620 --> 02:15.068
But don't worry,
'cause I'm here to help

02:15.172 --> 02:17.103
get those trains rolling
on time, you know what I mean?

02:17.206 --> 02:19.655
And save your relationship with
the mayor's donor?

02:19.758 --> 02:20.862
Win-win.

02:26.068 --> 02:27.310
<i>So, what?</i>

02:27.413 --> 02:28.275
Clay Cooper's been
hiding for 20 years?

02:28.379 --> 02:30.172
Maybe he wasn't hiding.

02:30.275 --> 02:32.724
Maybe he was captured
and turned.

02:32.827 --> 02:34.517
- Hey.
- Hey.

02:34.620 --> 02:37.034
So I know we've gone down
a dozen dead ends

02:37.137 --> 02:38.689
the last few days,
but I found something, okay?

02:38.793 --> 02:40.103
I found something
that connects the dots

02:40.206 --> 02:41.689
from the Clay Cooper
I thought I knew

02:41.793 --> 02:43.068
to the Clay Cooper who

02:43.172 --> 02:44.517
very well might be the head
of Grey Flag.

02:44.620 --> 02:46.586
Yeah, it's just,
it's a lot of dots to connect.

02:46.689 --> 02:49.206
Maybe we should look at
other theories, not force it.

02:49.310 --> 02:50.724
All the evidence points to this.

02:50.827 --> 02:53.655
I mean, every single Marine
in our unit was targeted

02:53.758 --> 02:55.413
- and murdered.
- So, you're still working

02:55.517 --> 02:57.896
from the premise that Coop went
all "Winter Soldier"

02:58.000 --> 03:00.482
after he thought you guys left
him for dead in Afghanistan?

03:00.586 --> 03:02.034
I stopped trying to
understand the why,

03:02.137 --> 03:03.793
and started trying to
figure out the how.

03:03.896 --> 03:05.931
Walker, we've got
two teams of FBI agents

03:06.034 --> 03:07.379
working day and night on this.

03:07.482 --> 03:09.413
I know that.
I know.

03:09.517 --> 03:12.827
But they don't have the history
with Coop that I do.

03:14.931 --> 03:16.931
- Whoa, whoa.
- There's no way he hit that.

03:17.034 --> 03:18.724
- Wow.
- I don't know how,

03:18.827 --> 03:19.965
but you cheated.

03:20.068 --> 03:23.275
Fellas, if I'd known
you threw darts

03:23.379 --> 03:24.689
as bad as you shoot an M4...

03:24.793 --> 03:26.206
What've you done now, Duke?

03:26.310 --> 03:27.482
Gentlemen,

03:27.586 --> 03:30.206
I apologize for whatever
sort of antics

03:30.310 --> 03:32.620
Corporal Culpepper
here's been up to,

03:32.724 --> 03:35.482
but I hope you boys will let him
atone by buying y'all a round.

03:35.586 --> 03:36.896
Oorah!

03:37.000 --> 03:38.551
PFC J.B. Hardage.

03:38.655 --> 03:41.344
- Thank you for
setting things right.
- No.

03:41.448 --> 03:42.793
Sergeant Fred Frausto.

03:42.896 --> 03:44.896
- Don't mention it.
<i>- I heard Coop</i>

03:45.000 --> 03:46.724
use that alias before--

03:46.827 --> 03:48.137
Fred Frausto.

03:48.241 --> 03:51.413
And when Julia and I
looked into it, we learned

03:51.517 --> 03:54.517
that a certain "Fred Frausto"
booked a room in Kandahar

03:54.620 --> 03:58.068
four months after Coop's
so-called death.

03:58.172 --> 04:00.517
Okay. Beyond the possibility
that he may have survived

04:00.620 --> 04:02.172
a few months after
he was declared KIA,

04:02.275 --> 04:03.931
I'm not sure
I see the relevance.

04:05.206 --> 04:08.413
Julia and I connected that alias

04:08.517 --> 04:09.448
to a different one.

04:09.551 --> 04:10.965
One that rented a car

04:11.068 --> 04:13.137
here in Austin, last week.

04:13.241 --> 04:15.172
Wait, wait, wait.
A different alias?

04:15.275 --> 04:17.172
- Yeah.
- So, Fred Frausto

04:17.275 --> 04:19.517
- didn't rent a car in Austin?
- No.

04:19.620 --> 04:21.413
But an alias
connected to that one did.

04:21.517 --> 04:24.965
Okay, look,
Coop kept his assets liquid,

04:25.068 --> 04:27.344
and he never used an alias
for more than six months.

04:27.448 --> 04:29.620
But he still had to
move his assets

04:29.724 --> 04:32.103
- from one alias to the next.
- So...

04:32.206 --> 04:34.137
you used forensic accounting
to connect the aliases,

04:34.241 --> 04:36.275
followed the money every time
he moved it to a new identity?

04:36.379 --> 04:37.655
Exactly.

04:37.758 --> 04:39.793
So once we established
the connection,

04:39.896 --> 04:41.965
Julia and I tracked down
the names until we got a hit.

04:42.068 --> 04:43.275
That rental.

04:43.379 --> 04:45.068
- Here in Austin.
- Okay.

04:45.172 --> 04:48.034
It's not bulletproof,
but it's definitely actionable.

04:48.137 --> 04:51.034
The rental agency equips
all their cars with

04:51.137 --> 04:53.620
the QuikRekover stolen vehicle
recovery systems, so...

04:53.724 --> 04:55.793
So, use the tracker to find
the car you think he rented?

04:55.896 --> 04:57.551
That... tracks.

04:57.655 --> 04:58.931
Great, because I already
spoke to a judge

04:59.034 --> 05:01.586
we trust, and got
a warrant for the tracker.

05:01.689 --> 05:03.482
Uh, all right, Cassie.

05:03.586 --> 05:04.758
- We got to move on this.
- Yeah.

05:04.862 --> 05:06.482
Hold on, hold on.
Cordi, hey, listen.

05:07.310 --> 05:08.965
This guy was your mentor, man.

05:09.068 --> 05:10.275
If you do find him,

05:10.379 --> 05:11.310
are you sure
you're gonna be able to

05:11.413 --> 05:13.034
slap the cuffs on him, or worse?

05:13.137 --> 05:15.413
Listen. My gut is telling me
that if I can just talk to him,

05:15.517 --> 05:18.000
I can deescalate this, and then
no one else has to get hurt.

05:18.103 --> 05:19.896
I don't know, Walker.

05:20.000 --> 05:23.586
I mean, you said that the guy's
edge of the coin, like you.

05:23.689 --> 05:27.275
How do we know that the coin
doesn't fall on tails?

05:27.379 --> 05:29.931
Which, in this metaphor,
is a bad thing.

05:30.034 --> 05:32.137
Look, the bottom line is this--
if he really murdered

05:32.241 --> 05:33.482
everybody in your unit,

05:33.586 --> 05:34.448
he's not gonna let you
take him alive.

05:34.551 --> 05:35.793
He's just not.

05:39.655 --> 05:41.724
If it comes to that...

05:41.827 --> 05:43.517
I'll have what it takes
to stop him.

05:43.620 --> 05:44.793
All right.

05:44.896 --> 05:47.344
And just in case
you don't have it in you,

05:47.448 --> 05:49.862
Cassie'll be there
to take the shot.

05:51.344 --> 05:52.965
Yeah.
We've got this.

05:53.068 --> 05:54.620
Yeah. Of course.

05:58.965 --> 06:02.137
♪ ♪

06:03.482 --> 06:05.137

06:16.413 --> 06:18.206

06:34.724 --> 06:37.620
You can't even clear phase one.

06:37.724 --> 06:39.172
I thought y'all
were supposed to be

06:39.275 --> 06:42.172
the dream team after you
survived some dumb mission.

06:42.275 --> 06:44.000
Which was meant to be
a milk run.

06:45.896 --> 06:47.275
How'd you get shot
on a milk run?

06:47.379 --> 06:48.793
And how're y'all even up

06:48.896 --> 06:51.275
for the Elite Squad when
me and Snyder did this trial

06:51.379 --> 06:52.724
in a minute flat?

06:52.827 --> 06:54.758
You completed it in a minute...

06:54.862 --> 06:58.275
but Snyder dropped the bag
when he ascended.

06:58.379 --> 07:00.000
A fatal misstep.

07:00.103 --> 07:01.551
Fatal?

07:01.655 --> 07:04.068
If you make the cut,

07:04.172 --> 07:06.482
there'll be seven pounds of
C-4 packed in that bag

07:06.586 --> 07:08.482
on the actual mission.

07:08.586 --> 07:10.103
Enough to tear down a building.

07:10.206 --> 07:12.068
Unless you're not up
for the task?

07:13.413 --> 07:14.758
Yeah, we're up for it.

07:14.862 --> 07:16.827
Ain't that right, Lana?

07:18.068 --> 07:22.034
Yeah. Yeah.
We got this.

07:41.034 --> 07:43.000
Get yourselves back
to the barracks now.

07:43.103 --> 07:44.241
Get a move on.

07:56.448 --> 07:58.827
They're resetting the elevator.

07:58.931 --> 08:00.862
You need to prep blast charges
for another run at the trial.

08:00.965 --> 08:02.931
And maybe try not to blow us up
next time?

08:03.034 --> 08:05.758
Excuse me?
My blast charge was just fine.

08:05.862 --> 08:07.793
- Hmm.
- What's your problem?

08:07.896 --> 08:09.413
You're the one
that's been off all morning.

08:09.517 --> 08:11.827
You never answered my questions
about our last mission.

08:11.931 --> 08:13.344
Like where'd you get
the combat gauze?

08:13.448 --> 08:15.862
And I heard a woman's voice
when we were under fire--

08:15.965 --> 08:17.965
all while you were triaging me.

08:18.068 --> 08:19.586
You couldn't have done all that.

08:19.689 --> 08:21.517
Not without support.
So, who was helping you?

08:21.620 --> 08:23.206
- Who was that woman?
- I'm a medic.

08:23.310 --> 08:25.137
I came prepared with
combat gauze.

08:25.241 --> 08:27.344
Besides, you were
half-conscious anyways.

08:27.448 --> 08:28.586
You don't know what you heard.

08:28.689 --> 08:29.586
I know what I heard.

08:29.689 --> 08:30.758
You know what?

08:30.862 --> 08:32.068
I requested you as my partner

08:32.172 --> 08:33.931
because nobody else
would take you.

08:35.241 --> 08:37.137
You need to get
your act together.

08:37.241 --> 08:40.137
- I have to be on this mission
in the Elite Squad.
- Why?

08:40.241 --> 08:41.379
With the way they're
keeping all the jobs

08:41.482 --> 08:42.655
of the mission separate,

08:42.758 --> 08:44.034
no communication between
teams, I mean,

08:44.137 --> 08:46.103
we don't even know
what the full Elite Squad

08:46.206 --> 08:47.379
will be tasked with.

08:47.482 --> 08:50.896
So, why is it so important
to you, Barnett?

08:51.000 --> 08:53.551
I don't need to explain
myself to you.

08:53.655 --> 08:57.551
I'm squared away. You're not.

09:08.862 --> 09:11.275
- Hey, can I ask you a question?
- Sure.

09:11.379 --> 09:13.137
I know you used to be
in politics, you know.

09:13.241 --> 09:15.000
I voted for you for D.A.

09:15.103 --> 09:16.758
What I don't understand is
what got you so interested

09:16.862 --> 09:18.275
in equine therapy.

09:19.103 --> 09:21.965
Well, it just, uh, you know,
really helped with everything

09:22.068 --> 09:23.724
that went on with
my brother and me--

09:23.827 --> 09:24.862
captivity.

09:24.965 --> 09:27.965
- Oh, yeah. Of course.
- Mm-hmm.

09:28.068 --> 09:30.172
I mean, obviously,
I read Julia Johnson's article

09:30.275 --> 09:32.137
- about what you went through.
- Yeah.

09:32.241 --> 09:35.310
That sounded horrible.
I-I can't even imagine.

09:35.413 --> 09:37.379
I don't know,
maybe I'm hunting too hard

09:37.482 --> 09:39.620
for a silver lining here, but...

09:39.724 --> 09:41.103
if you hadn't been
taken captive,

09:41.206 --> 09:42.965
I wouldn't even be alive today.

09:44.000 --> 09:45.689
Sorry, I don't really follow.

09:45.793 --> 09:47.758
The nerve agent attack
on the mayor's office.

09:47.862 --> 09:48.896
I was exposed.

09:49.000 --> 09:50.517
I could've died.
I would've died.

09:50.620 --> 09:52.379
Had you not made the connection

09:52.482 --> 09:54.034
between the chemist
smelling like sulfur

09:54.137 --> 09:55.965
which led Cordell
to the abandoned coal refinery

09:56.068 --> 09:57.344
where he found him making it.

09:57.448 --> 09:59.068
Huh.

09:59.172 --> 10:00.965
No, I never...

10:01.068 --> 10:03.551
I never really
thought of it that way.

10:03.655 --> 10:05.241
- Huh.
- Well, I have.

10:05.344 --> 10:06.896
A lot, actually.

10:07.000 --> 10:09.448
And I can't overstate
how much it means to me

10:09.551 --> 10:11.344
what you did that day.

10:11.448 --> 10:13.586
You're a real hero.

10:14.413 --> 10:15.896
I appreciate you saying that.

10:16.000 --> 10:18.103
Can I actually use some
of what we just discussed

10:18.206 --> 10:20.000
in the mayor's speech at
the medal ceremony tomorrow?

10:20.103 --> 10:21.758
You know, you guys are
getting honored,

10:21.862 --> 10:23.344
I'm punching up speeches...

10:23.448 --> 10:24.827
I think it'd play really well.

10:24.931 --> 10:27.000
Whoa, Ke--

10:27.103 --> 10:28.724
Are you...?

10:28.827 --> 10:30.310
- Kevin, are you, are you okay?
- Yeah, yeah.

10:30.413 --> 10:32.724
I think I got my nail here.

10:32.827 --> 10:34.517
- Oh!
- Ooh, yeah.

10:34.620 --> 10:36.448
That's my throttle hand, too.

10:36.551 --> 10:37.482
Throttle hand?

10:37.586 --> 10:39.068
Amateur pilot.

10:39.172 --> 10:42.137
Aren't you just
full of surprises?

10:42.241 --> 10:44.896
Well, uh, I saved you
from a nerve agent,

10:45.000 --> 10:48.068
I'm not gonna let you lose
a nail on your throttle hand.

10:48.172 --> 10:50.965
We got first aid over in
the farmhouse right over there.

10:51.068 --> 10:53.206
- All right.
- Take a break.

10:53.310 --> 10:55.137
- I'm sorry about all this.
- No, no, no, don't.

10:55.241 --> 10:57.103
I-I will finish the fence,
all right?

10:57.206 --> 10:59.172
- Thanks.
- Take care of that now.

11:05.517 --> 11:06.620
Cass.

11:06.724 --> 11:08.000
- Hey.
- Hey.

11:08.103 --> 11:09.724
I got the keys
to the impound vehicle.

11:09.827 --> 11:11.793
And, uh, you, you've got...?

11:11.896 --> 11:13.482
What exactly

11:13.586 --> 11:14.793
have you got there?

11:14.896 --> 11:17.068
Enhanced body armor and two M4s.

11:17.172 --> 11:18.896
Wow.

11:19.000 --> 11:21.931
I mean, I-I seem to recall

11:22.034 --> 11:23.517
when you didn't even want to
carry a sidearm.

11:23.620 --> 11:24.758
I've evolved.

11:24.862 --> 11:26.931
And Clay Cooper is
a Marine Raider.

11:27.034 --> 11:29.068
So better safe
than sorry, right?

11:29.172 --> 11:30.379
Right.

11:30.482 --> 11:32.344
Eh, listen, I was thinking,

11:32.448 --> 11:33.965
the judge only put my name
on the warrant,

11:34.068 --> 11:35.586
so I think it's best
if we divide and conquer.

11:35.689 --> 11:36.931
You know, it can save us

11:37.034 --> 11:38.413
a lot of headache
and save us some time.

11:38.517 --> 11:40.689
I'll go to the rental agency
and grab the QuikRekover

11:40.793 --> 11:42.206
and you can swing by the ranch

11:42.310 --> 11:44.793
and grab all the files
that Julia put together on Coop.

11:44.896 --> 11:46.068
You really think
we'll need those?

11:46.172 --> 11:47.551
- We'll have the tracker.
- Right, sure.

11:47.655 --> 11:49.137
But I mean, those files

11:49.241 --> 11:51.551
have details
on all of Coop's movements,

11:51.655 --> 11:53.034
his alias's records--

11:53.137 --> 11:55.137
details that could put you
and me a step ahead.

11:55.241 --> 11:56.344
You know?

11:56.448 --> 11:57.551
So, we'll meet back
up here after,

11:57.655 --> 12:00.724
uh, we can take this beast...

12:02.034 --> 12:04.241
...and track Coop.
Sound good?

12:04.344 --> 12:06.344
As long as I don't have to
drive that monstrosity.

12:06.448 --> 12:08.103
Deal.

13:01.448 --> 13:02.793
Stella? Augie?

13:02.896 --> 13:04.827
I'm grabbing some files
from your dad's office.

13:04.931 --> 13:06.206
Cassie.

13:06.931 --> 13:08.000
Hi.

13:08.103 --> 13:10.517
- Uh... Hi.
- Hi.

13:10.620 --> 13:12.551
- What are you...?
- Doing in Walker's house?

13:12.655 --> 13:14.000
Eh, yeah.

13:14.103 --> 13:16.793
Well, um, after I connected

13:16.896 --> 13:18.862
Liam and Stella with a donor
for their horse rescue,

13:18.965 --> 13:20.931
I figured I'd come out
and help with the build.

13:21.034 --> 13:22.413
But...

13:22.517 --> 13:23.724
...turns out I'm a bit of
a clod with the hammer.

13:23.827 --> 13:25.620
That's nice.

13:25.724 --> 13:28.000
The "helping the Walkers" part,
not the thumb.

13:28.103 --> 13:30.896
I mean, the thumb's fine, but...

13:31.000 --> 13:33.103
It's not fine. It's--
Cassie, stop. Just stop.

13:33.206 --> 13:34.724
Well, I for one,
am very relieved

13:34.827 --> 13:35.862
it's not awkward between us.

13:35.965 --> 13:38.344
Oh, my God. Totally.

13:41.896 --> 13:44.206
All right, I should get back to
bludgeoning my fingers.

13:45.275 --> 13:46.517
Yeah.

13:46.620 --> 13:48.344
Well, it's good to see you.

13:50.586 --> 13:52.482
You know, look, Kevin...

13:52.586 --> 13:54.862
You and Trey are friends,

13:54.965 --> 13:57.413
and I know I'm gonna
see you around,

13:57.517 --> 14:00.862
and I just don't want it to
always feel like...

14:00.965 --> 14:03.137
this, between us.

14:03.241 --> 14:05.310
Cassie...

14:06.517 --> 14:09.724
I promise you next time
it'll be different.

14:09.827 --> 14:11.827
It was really good to see you.

14:11.931 --> 14:14.103
You, too.

14:22.275 --> 14:23.931
Come on, keep up the pace.

14:25.689 --> 14:27.103
Come on.

14:38.862 --> 14:40.620
Watch it.

14:42.689 --> 14:44.344
Clear.

14:53.620 --> 14:55.413
- We failed again
for the second time.
- Just stop,

14:55.517 --> 14:57.379
because you screwed up
that time, not me.

14:57.482 --> 14:59.413
- I didn't say you did.
- No, but you said

14:59.517 --> 15:01.172
you had to be
on the Elite Squad.

15:01.275 --> 15:03.241
- I know what I said.
- So if it's so damn important,

15:03.344 --> 15:04.379
why'd you use
such a small charge?

15:04.482 --> 15:05.758
Because I didn't want to
hurt you!

15:05.862 --> 15:08.103
I put your safety
over my concerns!

15:16.862 --> 15:19.241
You're not who you say you are.

15:21.620 --> 15:25.206
When I got shot
on our first mission,

15:25.310 --> 15:28.655
Grey Flag was willing
to let me die.

15:28.758 --> 15:30.137
But you...

15:31.000 --> 15:32.896
...a guy I just met,

15:33.000 --> 15:35.310
risked your life to save mine.

15:36.931 --> 15:38.482
You're not one of them.

15:39.413 --> 15:41.068
If you'd shared your doubts
about me with anyone,

15:41.172 --> 15:44.206
I'd be in a tight spot
right now.

15:44.310 --> 15:46.448
Clearly, you haven't.

15:46.551 --> 15:47.965
Why?

15:51.448 --> 15:55.379
Grey Flag recruited me
with hopes of

15:55.482 --> 15:59.724
"making real change in the world
on a grassroots level."

15:59.827 --> 16:02.379
They took me under their wing,

16:02.482 --> 16:05.413
they helped with my mother's
medical issues by

16:05.517 --> 16:08.344
"cutting through
the bureaucratic red tape."

16:08.448 --> 16:11.586
And by the time I
learned what that meant...

16:12.931 --> 16:14.310
I...

16:14.413 --> 16:16.103
I don't know,
I guess I was just willing

16:16.206 --> 16:18.137
to overlook certain things.

16:19.724 --> 16:21.275
"For the greater good."

16:22.413 --> 16:24.310
But now I'm here and...

16:24.413 --> 16:28.310
and this is, this is a far cry
from where I started.

16:29.310 --> 16:31.551
- I...
- Listen, Lana.

16:33.206 --> 16:35.068
I didn't request for you
to be my partner

16:35.172 --> 16:38.206
because no one else
would take you.

16:38.310 --> 16:39.758
I requested you to be my partner

16:39.862 --> 16:41.275
because you're not
one of them either.

16:41.379 --> 16:43.000
Hey, hey.

16:43.103 --> 16:44.724
- You don't have to do this.
- No.

16:44.827 --> 16:48.827
I've seen what happens
to people who leave,

16:48.931 --> 16:50.655
and to their families.

16:53.551 --> 16:56.310
What if there was a safe way out
for you and your family?

16:56.413 --> 16:58.655
Hey, hey, listen to me.

17:00.137 --> 17:01.896
What if I found a weak point
in the perimeter

17:02.000 --> 17:03.379
under the ash tree

17:03.482 --> 17:05.172
where a branch knocked out
the power to the cameras

17:05.275 --> 17:06.862
and the electrical fence?

17:10.241 --> 17:12.241
Guess what I heard.

17:14.965 --> 17:16.344
Boss is coming tonight

17:16.448 --> 17:19.310
to announce who's gonna be
on the Elite Squad.

17:21.000 --> 17:22.379
Okay.

17:23.586 --> 17:25.172
Is that all?

17:25.275 --> 17:29.172
And I'm supposed to tell you
that you two get one more shot.

17:30.206 --> 17:32.413
Don't ask me why.

18:05.620 --> 18:07.172
Come on.

18:10.206 --> 18:12.517
Oh, no.

18:14.758 --> 18:16.517
Damn it.

All right, all right.

19:28.448 --> 19:29.379
Tie it off.

19:29.482 --> 19:30.931
There it is.

19:32.172 --> 19:33.448
- All right.
- I cannot believe

19:33.551 --> 19:34.620
we actually did it.

19:34.724 --> 19:36.448
It's kind of mind-blowing.

19:36.551 --> 19:38.344
It's kind of a miracle.

19:38.448 --> 19:40.517
It's kind of a stable.
But to each his own.

19:42.862 --> 19:44.620
Hey, Mawline, um...

19:44.724 --> 19:48.517
I know I'm the last person
to say anything, so...

19:48.620 --> 19:50.965
for real, please,
with all due respect.

19:51.068 --> 19:52.172
Um...

19:52.275 --> 19:54.896
Overdue respect.

19:55.000 --> 19:58.965
I feel like you can be
a bit... intimidating,

19:59.068 --> 20:02.482
and I just feel like
you kind of don't like Kevin.

20:02.586 --> 20:04.310
- Mm.
- He's all right.

20:04.413 --> 20:06.379
You know?
He's kind of like a mentor,

20:06.482 --> 20:08.655
and he's even gonna coach
Sacred Heart Model UN

20:08.758 --> 20:10.172
if I join.

20:12.413 --> 20:13.413
So...

20:13.517 --> 20:15.172
What do you think?

20:15.275 --> 20:17.206
I think our dream's
becoming real.

20:17.310 --> 20:20.206
Yeah,
and I think we should put

20:20.310 --> 20:22.034
those vibration plates
for the horses

20:22.137 --> 20:23.793
right over there.

20:23.896 --> 20:26.965
I thought you said we needed to
hire equine therapists first.

20:27.068 --> 20:28.896
Well, I wanted to start
with your idea.

20:29.000 --> 20:31.172
If that's okay... partner.

20:33.103 --> 20:34.862
Stella, August,

20:34.965 --> 20:37.344
come over and help me
a little bit.

20:37.448 --> 20:39.379
- Yes, sir.
- Okay.

20:41.034 --> 20:42.862
- Hey, Liam, hey.
- Hmm? Hey.

20:42.965 --> 20:44.724
Look, what I said this morning

20:44.827 --> 20:46.793
about the donor
and the trains running on time,

20:46.896 --> 20:48.241
that came out wrong.

20:48.344 --> 20:50.068
- Oh.
- I just wanted you guys
to succeed.

20:50.172 --> 20:53.724
And, well, turns out you guys
have got exactly what it takes.

20:53.827 --> 20:55.586
Well, thanks, Kevin.

20:55.689 --> 20:58.517
And what we discussed earlier,

20:58.620 --> 21:01.137
it would be an honor if you were
to put it in the mayor's speech.

21:01.241 --> 21:02.862
- Sounds good.
- Yeah.

21:02.965 --> 21:05.551
- I got to get back to work.
- Get to it.

21:05.655 --> 21:07.172
All right.

21:07.275 --> 21:08.482
Hey.

21:09.620 --> 21:11.137
You helped my family today.

21:11.241 --> 21:13.620
And I appreciate it, truly.

21:13.724 --> 21:17.310
So, how do you feel about
staying for dinner?

21:17.413 --> 21:18.965
You know, a do-over for Thanksgiving.

21:19.068 --> 21:22.206
And maybe this time,
you can take off your shoes.

21:22.310 --> 21:24.310
The storm.
I ruined your floors.

21:24.413 --> 21:26.551
And you seem so
well-mannered otherwise.

21:26.655 --> 21:28.517
Oh, I am so sorry.
I don't even know what to say.

21:28.620 --> 21:30.310
I-I think
I was distracted and...

21:30.413 --> 21:31.896
And then
there was a lot going on?

21:32.000 --> 21:33.413
- Yes.
- Yeah.

21:33.517 --> 21:35.793
I'll tell you what,
I-I-I would love a do-over.

21:35.896 --> 21:37.689
Unfortunately,
I have to take a rain check.

21:37.793 --> 21:39.241
Duty calls
at the mayor's office.

21:39.344 --> 21:41.344
- Well, next time.
- Take care.

21:41.448 --> 21:43.448
- You gotta go? All right.
- Yeah.

21:44.551 --> 21:46.620
That was very sweet of you
to say, sis.

21:46.724 --> 21:50.344
Nice callback.

21:50.448 --> 21:51.551
And you still oversold it.

21:51.655 --> 21:54.310
Give me some slack.

22:45.034 --> 22:47.758
Nah. Too easy, Coop.

23:49.068 --> 23:50.172
Hey, what happened?

23:50.275 --> 23:51.689
Snyder spotted Lana
by the perimeter.

23:51.793 --> 23:53.413
She coldcocked him and took off.

23:53.517 --> 23:55.000
I won't have a deserter

23:55.103 --> 23:57.000
on the day the guy in charge
of all of this arrives.

23:57.103 --> 23:59.344
Lock and load,
and kill on sight.

24:18.137 --> 24:19.448
Lana.

24:19.551 --> 24:20.896
- Lana.
- Trey.

24:21.000 --> 24:22.310
Hey. We don't have much time.

24:22.413 --> 24:24.068
Come on, I'll give you a boost.

24:26.241 --> 24:27.517
There you go.

24:35.620 --> 24:36.758
- You good?
- Yeah.

24:36.862 --> 24:39.482
Deserters!

24:42.620 --> 24:43.827
Lana.

24:43.931 --> 24:45.068
Lana, listen to me,
listen to me.

24:45.172 --> 24:46.965
Hey, hey, go to
89 Glencroft Road.

24:47.068 --> 24:49.172
I have friends there that'll
keep you and your family safe.

24:49.275 --> 24:51.310
Now here, take my notes
and tell them...

24:52.344 --> 24:55.827
Uh... listen, tell them
that the leader of Grey Flag

24:55.931 --> 24:57.172
is gonna be
at the compound tonight.

24:57.275 --> 24:58.931
This might be their
only chance to stop him.

24:59.034 --> 25:01.103
All right, now, they're not
gonna trust you at first,

25:01.206 --> 25:04.103
so tell them that Walter Mercado
sent you from the stars.

25:04.206 --> 25:05.275
All right?

25:05.379 --> 25:06.965
They'll know
what it means, okay?

25:07.068 --> 25:09.862
I'd ask why you're not coming,
but I think I'm finally

25:09.965 --> 25:12.034
getting an idea of
what you're really doing here.

and not done this?

28:16.586 --> 28:18.344
It's good to see you, Cordi.

28:25.482 --> 28:27.931
- Captain.
- Hey.

28:28.034 --> 28:29.413
Walker's not here?

28:30.517 --> 28:32.344
I waited for him at HQ.

28:32.448 --> 28:34.068
We were supposed to meet there
after he grabbed the tracker

28:34.172 --> 28:36.068
and I got these files on Coop.

28:36.172 --> 28:38.896
I thought maybe
he came here instead.

28:39.000 --> 28:40.137
Don't worry about Walker.
You know how it is.

28:40.241 --> 28:41.413
Rental agency
probably insisted on

28:41.517 --> 28:42.862
calling the judge
to validate the warrant.

28:42.965 --> 28:44.034
He'll be here any minute.

28:44.137 --> 28:45.379
- Yeah.
- In the meantime,

28:45.482 --> 28:47.034
here, you can help me
cross-reference

28:47.137 --> 28:48.793
the background of
some of these Grey Flag goons.

28:48.896 --> 28:50.310
Okay.

28:50.413 --> 28:52.379
See? What'd I tell you?

28:52.482 --> 28:55.482
We stopped her before
she got to the door.

28:55.586 --> 28:58.413
She's unarmed.
She said Trey Barnett sent her.

28:58.517 --> 29:00.068
You're the woman who got shot.

29:00.172 --> 29:03.724
I recognize your voice.

29:03.827 --> 29:05.551
You helped save my life.

29:08.586 --> 29:11.551
Trey said you could protect me
from Grey Flag.

29:14.103 --> 29:15.758
What're you doing here?

29:15.862 --> 29:17.448
No, no. You know what?

29:17.551 --> 29:18.862
What are you doing alive?!

29:18.965 --> 29:21.655
And how did you go
from a man I respected,

29:21.758 --> 29:23.931
a man I modeled myself after,

29:24.034 --> 29:26.586
to-to the leader of
an anarchist group?

29:26.689 --> 29:29.862
Man, two decades
and this is how you greet me?

29:29.965 --> 29:31.275
Not even a thank-you

29:31.379 --> 29:32.758
for pulling you out of
that burning truck?

29:32.862 --> 29:34.034
You crashed into my car.

29:34.137 --> 29:35.379
You caused the vehicle

29:35.482 --> 29:36.827
- to catch fire.
- You cornered me.

29:36.931 --> 29:38.689
I was just looking for
a way out.

29:38.793 --> 29:40.275
And besides, I only tapped you.

29:40.379 --> 29:41.931
I was just trying to
disable your vehicle

29:42.034 --> 29:43.413
and slow you down a little bit,

29:43.517 --> 29:45.448
but that thing you were driving
was such a lemon,

29:45.551 --> 29:46.827
it just fell apart.

29:46.931 --> 29:48.275
And really, I did you a favor.

29:48.379 --> 29:49.620
You also did me a favor
when you had me abducted

29:49.724 --> 29:51.517
- and tortured?
- That wasn't me.

29:54.448 --> 29:58.379
You know, Coop?
I saw my Grey Flag file.

29:58.482 --> 30:00.655
Had a whole lot of details
about our time together

30:00.758 --> 30:01.758
in Afghanistan.

30:01.862 --> 30:02.931
Our time together

30:03.034 --> 30:05.137
before you turned into

30:05.241 --> 30:07.310
whoever the hell you are today.

30:08.344 --> 30:10.965
Cordell, what do you think
I'm doing here?

30:11.068 --> 30:12.379
For starters,

30:12.482 --> 30:13.689
I think you're boiling
that echinacea

30:13.793 --> 30:15.000
so you can treat
your burned hand

30:15.103 --> 30:17.103
and get back to
your Grey Flag comrades--

30:17.206 --> 30:18.551
your real brothers.

30:18.655 --> 30:23.068
So first of all, I burned
my hand saving your life.

30:25.068 --> 30:27.379
Second of all, I came back
for my mother's funeral.

30:28.827 --> 30:30.896
And you expect me
to believe that?

30:31.000 --> 30:34.413
Coop...
you faked your own death.

30:34.517 --> 30:35.965
One time.

30:36.068 --> 30:37.965
What? Now all my credibility
goes out the window?

30:38.068 --> 30:40.689
I used to consider you
my brother.

30:40.793 --> 30:43.000
So did Turner and Ortiz.

30:43.103 --> 30:45.275
And Tommy.
And you murdered them.

30:45.379 --> 30:50.241
You stabbed Tommy
and you let him bleed out.

30:51.241 --> 30:53.068
You really think
I'm capable of that?

30:53.172 --> 30:54.551
I don't know
what you're capable of.

30:54.655 --> 30:56.655
- I don't even know who you are.
- Oh, come on.

30:56.758 --> 30:59.482
You know me, stinker.

30:59.586 --> 31:02.517
D-Don't "stinker" me.
Don't go to that well.

31:02.620 --> 31:04.310
You're caught, Coop.

31:04.413 --> 31:06.896
And now you're gonna
answer my questions.

31:07.000 --> 31:08.482
All right, fine.

31:08.586 --> 31:10.896
So if I am this evil,

31:11.000 --> 31:13.655
vile person that
you're saying that I am,

31:13.758 --> 31:15.862
why the hell did I save you?

31:15.965 --> 31:17.482
Huh?

31:19.724 --> 31:23.551
Why didn't I just shoot you?

31:27.448 --> 31:30.689
Got no interest
in ever hurting you, Cordi.

31:30.793 --> 31:32.034
No.

31:32.137 --> 31:33.379
No, you just want to
toy with me first.

31:33.482 --> 31:35.413
Yeah, torture me and my family.

31:35.517 --> 31:37.241
That's not true.

31:37.344 --> 31:40.793
So if you actually want to talk,
then let's have a seat.

31:40.896 --> 31:44.551
And we'll talk like the old
brothers that we actually are.

31:46.793 --> 31:49.448
I literally just came from
the Grey Flag compound.

31:49.551 --> 31:51.413
- I can direct you there.
- Why should we trust you?

31:51.517 --> 31:53.103
How do we know
this isn't a trap?

31:53.206 --> 31:55.586
Trey said you would think that.

31:55.689 --> 31:58.103
He told me to tell you,

31:58.206 --> 32:01.724
"Walter Mercado sent me
from the stars."

32:01.827 --> 32:03.344
Okay.

32:03.448 --> 32:05.103
- He said you would understand.
- It's something

32:05.206 --> 32:06.965
I told him when we first met.

32:07.068 --> 32:08.517
Something only Trey would know.

32:08.620 --> 32:10.482
Okay.

32:10.586 --> 32:11.896
Look, there's one more thing.

32:12.000 --> 32:13.931
I worked for Grey Flag
for years,

32:14.034 --> 32:16.068
and I never saw
the guy in charge.

32:16.172 --> 32:20.068
But he is going to be
at the compound tonight.

32:22.655 --> 32:24.827
Might be our best chance
to catch him.

32:25.862 --> 32:28.000
<i>Heads are gonna roll.</i>

32:28.103 --> 32:30.689
I can't have deserters
in the wind.

32:30.793 --> 32:32.620
How'd this happen?
What'd you see, Barnett?

32:32.724 --> 32:35.896
When I got there,
Eichmann was already shot, sir.

32:41.689 --> 32:42.896
Hey, hang in there.

32:44.310 --> 32:47.620
I saw you...

32:47.724 --> 32:49.551
help her.

32:50.620 --> 32:51.965
Traitor.

32:52.827 --> 32:55.034
<i>I tried to revive him, but...</i>

32:55.137 --> 32:56.827
- it was already too late.
- Where was Lana?

32:56.931 --> 32:59.241
She was long gone.

33:00.551 --> 33:02.172
Now that I know
that she's a traitor,

33:02.275 --> 33:03.655
I wish I hadn't saved her life

33:03.758 --> 33:05.448
on our first mission.

33:06.482 --> 33:09.344
I wish I'd just
let her bleed out.

33:09.448 --> 33:11.793
Eichmann's death
was a real blow,

33:11.896 --> 33:15.379
but you're the better candidate
for this Elite Squad.

33:16.413 --> 33:18.689
You and Snyder will make
good partners.

33:18.793 --> 33:20.448
Wait, sir, are you saying
that I'm...?

33:20.551 --> 33:24.068
I'm supposed to let our leader
make the announcement,

33:24.172 --> 33:25.896
but you made the cut, Barnett.

33:26.000 --> 33:29.448
You're now on the Elite Squad.

33:41.620 --> 33:43.137
If you don't want to
answer my questions,

33:43.241 --> 33:44.827
I'm gonna leave you
handcuffed here,

33:44.931 --> 33:46.137
hike back to civilization,

33:46.241 --> 33:48.586
and return with the Feds
and the Rangers

33:48.689 --> 33:50.758
who don't play so nice.

33:50.862 --> 33:52.275
You try the same crap with them,

33:52.379 --> 33:55.137
they will not hesitate
to use deadly force.

33:55.241 --> 33:57.000
Fine.
What do you want to know?

33:57.103 --> 33:59.379
I want to know
how you became the monster

33:59.482 --> 34:01.241
that nearly broke apart
my family.

34:01.344 --> 34:02.241
I'm not a monster.

34:02.344 --> 34:05.172
I'm strategic, maybe...

34:05.275 --> 34:06.517
You're a coward.

34:06.620 --> 34:07.724
Maybe.

34:13.137 --> 34:16.517
You know, 20 years ago,
that blast should've killed me.

34:18.413 --> 34:22.793
And when I came to, I knew that
they would mark me KIA.

34:22.896 --> 34:24.448
I just...

34:26.137 --> 34:28.482
I just operated on instinct.

34:29.724 --> 34:31.275
I ran.

34:31.379 --> 34:34.413
No, you don't make a decision
like that on instinct, Coop.

34:34.517 --> 34:37.655
That wouldn't have been... sudden.

34:38.724 --> 34:41.000
You were sitting with something,
weren't you?

34:41.103 --> 34:43.000
Something was bothering you.

34:43.103 --> 34:44.551
And just, I never saw it.

34:44.655 --> 34:46.793
Yeah, because I had to be
your leader, didn't I?

34:46.896 --> 34:48.310
- Everyone was always
counting on me.
- Not that day.

34:48.413 --> 34:49.689
Not that day,
you weren't our leader.

34:49.793 --> 34:52.275
That day... you ran.

34:53.689 --> 34:54.931
Yeah.

34:55.034 --> 34:56.551
Yeah, Cordi, that day I ran.

34:56.655 --> 35:00.724
- Mm-hmm.
- I ran from my family,
from my job,

35:00.827 --> 35:02.034
my responsibilities.

35:03.241 --> 35:06.310
I honestly thought my family
would be better off without me.

35:09.551 --> 35:12.241
So, you chose to just disappear?

35:12.344 --> 35:14.482
And decided to
come back years later

35:14.586 --> 35:17.413
as the leader of
an anarchist organization?

35:17.517 --> 35:20.206
Walker, I'm guilty of
a lot of stuff--

35:20.310 --> 35:21.827
deserting the Marine Corps,

35:21.931 --> 35:24.689
allowing the people that I love
to think that I was dead,

35:24.793 --> 35:27.689
but I am not guilty of
Grey Flag's crimes.

35:27.793 --> 35:29.068
Then who is?

35:29.172 --> 35:31.000
I wish I knew.

35:31.103 --> 35:35.551
Cordi, of all people,
you know me.

35:35.655 --> 35:38.896
And deep in your heart you know
there is no way in hell

35:39.000 --> 35:41.758
that I can do
any of these heinous acts.

35:43.689 --> 35:45.413
Trust your gut.

35:50.275 --> 35:51.793
I've been beating myself up.

35:52.620 --> 35:56.620
Blaming myself for your death.

35:57.965 --> 35:59.862
For two decades.

35:59.965 --> 36:03.034
You've been dead.

36:03.137 --> 36:05.206
So this?
Right now?

36:06.551 --> 36:08.482
It's like I'm talking
to a ghost.

36:08.586 --> 36:10.655
I don't know
what my gut's telling me.

36:11.758 --> 36:13.448
I think you do.

36:15.344 --> 36:18.413
You became the man
I fell short of.

36:19.689 --> 36:22.172
Hell, at least I did that right.

36:22.275 --> 36:25.689
Got you started off
on the right path.

36:27.344 --> 36:30.413
20 years is a long time, Cordi.

36:32.103 --> 36:34.689
You just never know
what someone will turn into.

36:36.310 --> 36:38.206
No, I guess you don't.

36:41.724 --> 36:43.068
All right, well.

36:43.172 --> 36:46.413
This is all
well and nice, but...

36:48.275 --> 36:49.517
...none of it means a damn thing

36:49.620 --> 36:51.448
if you're not man enough
to come clean.

36:51.551 --> 36:54.241
All of the evidence

36:54.344 --> 36:56.103
points to you.

36:56.206 --> 36:57.586
So we can end this
once and for all.

36:57.689 --> 37:00.551
Just tell me why
you created Grey Flag.

37:00.655 --> 37:04.448
Give me some intel
that can stop more attacks

37:04.551 --> 37:06.448
and needless deaths,

37:06.551 --> 37:09.620
and maybe, just maybe,
I can get you leniency.

37:09.724 --> 37:12.206
No more people have to get hurt.

37:14.655 --> 37:17.655
It sounds like Grey Flag
nearly destroyed your family.

37:19.896 --> 37:22.379
Well, it completely
destroyed mine.

37:27.862 --> 37:30.620
I'll tell you whatever
you want to know.

37:30.724 --> 37:33.517
Hell, stinker...

37:33.620 --> 37:35.655
you can even have your gun back.

38:47.724 --> 38:49.275
No!

38:50.275 --> 38:51.172
Now, Cordi.

38:51.275 --> 38:52.551
I didn't return that

38:52.655 --> 38:54.034
so you can shoot me
in the back with it.

38:54.137 --> 38:55.379
Uncuff me.

38:55.482 --> 38:56.310
I'm not the one you're after.

38:56.413 --> 38:58.275
Then who is?

38:58.379 --> 39:01.034
Who is the leader of Grey Flag?

39:01.137 --> 39:03.206
It's not your fight, Cordi.

39:04.000 --> 39:05.724
This is something
I got to do on my own.

39:07.275 --> 39:08.965
Don't.

39:10.034 --> 39:12.931
You know, I never wanted you to
blame yourself for my death.

39:13.034 --> 39:14.482
Not then.

39:14.586 --> 39:16.655
And not now.

39:20.379 --> 39:22.103
See you down the line, partner.

39:25.241 --> 39:26.137
Coop.

39:26.241 --> 39:27.931
Coop!

39:49.793 --> 39:51.413
Call me when you get this, okay?

39:51.517 --> 39:53.896
No answer.

39:54.000 --> 39:55.689
I can't believe
I didn't see this coming.

39:55.793 --> 39:57.000
He sent me to the farmhouse

39:57.103 --> 39:58.896
so he could go after Coop
on his own.

39:59.000 --> 40:01.241
Don't beat yourself up.
I didn't see it coming either.

40:01.344 --> 40:04.586
I've already got patrols out
looking for him, but...

40:04.689 --> 40:06.379
can't really dwell on that
right now.

40:06.482 --> 40:07.586
Besides, if Walker's right

40:07.689 --> 40:09.620
and Cooper's the head of
Grey Flag,

40:09.724 --> 40:12.620
then according to Lana,
he's gonna be here tonight.

40:17.482 --> 40:19.517
Whoa.

40:19.620 --> 40:20.931
Grey Flag must have

40:21.034 --> 40:23.827
some pretty powerful connections
to cover this up.

40:25.137 --> 40:26.517
