'CAUSE IF ANYBODY NEEDS
TO BE CELIBATE, IT'S MEREDITH.

00:16.133 --> 00:17.533
I'M FINN DANDRIDGE.
I'M DOC'S VET.

00:17.567 --> 00:19.633
I'M OFF MEN.
NO MORE MEN.

00:19.667 --> 00:22.367
YOU BROUGHT THE BABY
TO WORK?
I'M COVERED IN MOMMY.

00:22.400 --> 00:24.167
BUT THAT DOES NOT MEAN
I WILL BE MOMMY-TRACKED.

00:24.200 --> 00:25.600
(Alex)
YOU'RE HIS DOCTOR, IZZIE.

00:25.633 --> 00:28.733
HE'S YOUR HALF-DEAD, POSSIBLY
SOON-TO-BE ALL-DEAD PATIENT.

00:28.767 --> 00:30.000
(Cristina) YOU SHOULD
SEE THEM TOGETHER.

00:30.033 --> 00:31.400
THEY'RE, LIKE, DOING THINGS LIKE
RUNNING AND COOKING AND TALKING.

00:31.433 --> 00:34.533
IT'S LIKE THEY'RE BONDING.

00:34.567 --> 00:37.100
GEORGE O'MALLEY
IS SWEET AND KIND.
YOU LIVE HERE?

00:37.133 --> 00:38.467
I'M NOT CRAZY OR ANYTHING.

00:38.500 --> 00:40.600
I JUST SPEND SO MUCH TIME
HERE IN THE HOSPITAL.

00:40.633 --> 00:42.833
(Izzie) HOLY CRAP.
GEORGE IS HER McDREAMY.

00:42.867 --> 00:46.033

00:48.300 --> 00:50.300
(Meredith) THEY KEY TO BEING
A SUCCESSFUL INTERN

00:50.333 --> 00:52.233
IS WHAT WE GIVE UP--

00:52.267 --> 00:56.733
SLEEP, FRIENDS,
A NORMAL LIFE.

00:56.767 --> 00:59.633
WE SACRIFICE IT ALL
FOR THAT ONE AMAZING MOMENT...

00:59.667 --> 01:01.067
(coughs)

01:01.067 --> 01:02.800
THAT MOMENT

01:02.833 --> 01:05.567
WHEN YOU CAN LEGALLY
CALL YOURSELF A SURGEON.

01:05.600 --> 01:08.233
THANK YOU.

01:08.267 --> 01:10.300
OH, THANK YOU,
THANK YOU, THANK YOU.

01:10.333 --> 01:11.633
THANKS.

01:11.667 --> 01:15.267
THERE ARE DAYS THAT MAKE
THE SACRIFICES SEEM WORTHWHILE.

01:15.300 --> 01:16.767
(laughs) OH.

01:16.800 --> 01:18.700
MY GOD, YOU'RE--
YOU'RE THANKING ME

01:18.733 --> 01:20.833
FOR THE MOST BORING SEX EVER?

01:20.867 --> 01:22.800
I DIDN'T KNOW
WHAT ELSE TO SAY.

01:22.833 --> 01:24.633
I MEAN, YOU DID YOUR BEST.

01:24.667 --> 01:26.467
OH, GREAT, THANKS. YOU, TOO.
IT WAS REALLY NICE WORK.

01:26.500 --> 01:28.367
WE USED TO BE REALLY GOOD
AT THIS, DIDN'T WE?

01:28.400 --> 01:30.500
WE'RE GONNA DO THIS
UNTIL WE GET IT RIGHT.

01:30.533 --> 01:31.467
OW!
OW!

01:31.500 --> 01:33.133
OH, JEEZ. AH.

01:33.167 --> 01:34.400
(telephone rings)

01:34.433 --> 01:36.600
PERFECT. OH!
IT COULD BE THE HOSPITAL.

01:36.633 --> 01:38.133
HELLO. HI.

01:38.167 --> 01:40.067
NO, NO, NO, NO.
IT'S ABOUT DOC.

01:40.100 --> 01:41.467
YEAH. NO, I'M HERE.

01:41.500 --> 01:44.067
YEAH, I CAN PICK HIM UP
THIS MORNING.

01:44.067 --> 01:45.800
SURE. I--
COME ON, COME ON.

01:45.833 --> 01:47.467
HEY, DR. DAN--DR. DANDRIDGE...
COME ON.

01:47.500 --> 01:49.400
WE'RE GONNA
HAVE TO CALL YOU BACK

01:49.433 --> 01:51.600
'CAUSE WE'RE TRYING REALLY HARD
TO HAVE SOME DECENT SEX HERE.

01:51.633 --> 01:53.533
What? What is so funny?
(Derek laughs)

01:53.567 --> 01:55.200
(line disconnects)

01:55.233 --> 01:57.133
AND THEN THERE ARE THE DAYS

01:57.167 --> 01:59.433
WHERE EVERYTHING FEELS LIKE
A SACRIFICE.

01:59.467 --> 02:01.567
EVERYTHING OKAY?

02:01.600 --> 02:04.233
YEAH. EVERYTHING'S GREAT.

02:04.267 --> 02:07.067
HEY, DOC. YOU LOOK GOOD.

02:07.100 --> 02:09.100
HE LOOKS GOOD.
IT MAY JUST BE A VIRUS,

02:09.133 --> 02:11.067
BUT I'D LIKE TO WAIT
TILL WE GET THE BLOOD TESTS

02:11.067 --> 02:12.800
AND THE X-RAY WORK BACK
BEFORE I SAY ANYTHING FOR SURE.

02:12.833 --> 02:15.133
SO HE CAN GO HOME TODAY? 'CAUSE
DEREK SAYS HE CAN PICK HIM UP.

02:15.167 --> 02:16.667
HE CAN GO HOME.
YOU HEAR THAT, DOC?

02:16.700 --> 02:18.800
YOU CAN GO HOME.
(Doc pants)

02:18.833 --> 02:21.567
SO YOU AND DEREK, UH...

02:21.600 --> 02:23.167
YOU'RE TOGETHER?

02:23.200 --> 02:24.833
UH...

02:24.867 --> 02:28.400
UH, DEREK AND I ARE,
UM, JUST FRIENDS.

02:28.433 --> 02:31.600
HE'S MARRIED,
AND I'M KNITTING A SWEATER.

02:31.633 --> 02:34.200
AND, UH, WELL, I GUESS
I'M RAMBLING,

02:34.233 --> 02:36.133
WHICH I TEND TO DO
A LOT OF LATELY,

02:36.167 --> 02:39.067
AND I WISH SOMEBODY WOULD JUST
TELL ME TO SHUT UP.

02:39.067 --> 02:40.533
BUT MY POINT IS,

02:40.567 --> 02:42.833
YEAH, WE'RE--WE'RE, UH,

02:42.867 --> 02:45.300
HE'S MARRIED,
AND I'M KNITTING A SWEATER.

02:45.333 --> 02:47.567
SO YOU'RE SINGLE?
SINGLE?

02:47.600 --> 02:49.500
I ASK BECAUSE I WAS WONDERING

02:49.533 --> 02:52.300
IF YOU WOULD LIKE
TO GO OUT WITH ME.
OUT, WITH YOU?

02:52.333 --> 02:53.433
ON A DATE, TONIGHT?

02:53.467 --> 02:55.100
DATE, TONIGHT?

02:55.133 --> 02:57.067
AND YOU'RE REPEATING
EVERYTHING I SAY

02:57.067 --> 02:59.067
SO THAT YOU CAN
BUY YOURSELF SOME TIME

02:59.100 --> 03:01.067
AND FIGURE OUT A WAY
TO LET ME DOWN EASY.

03:01.067 --> 03:02.767
IT'S OKAY. I GET IT.

03:02.800 --> 03:05.400
NO, NO, NO. I-I-I, UH...

03:05.433 --> 03:07.600
YOU KNOW, YOU'RE VERY...
IT'S JUST THAT, IF I WERE,

03:07.633 --> 03:10.367
YOU WOULD...

03:10.400 --> 03:12.067
NOT DATING.

03:12.100 --> 03:14.233
AND THEN THERE ARE
THE SACRIFICES

03:14.267 --> 03:17.133
THAT YOU CAN'T EVEN
FIGURE OUT WHY YOU'RE MAKING.

03:17.167 --> 03:19.367
ANOTHER DAY...

03:19.400 --> 03:23.067
AND ONCE AGAIN, I DON'T SEE
MY NAME ON THE BOARD.

03:23.100 --> 03:26.633
CHIEF, ANY REASON MY NAME
ISN'T ON THE BOARD?

03:26.667 --> 03:28.167
UH...

03:29.400 --> 03:30.833
SLOW DAY.

03:30.867 --> 03:33.167
HE JUST PATTED ME
ON THE BACK.

03:33.200 --> 03:35.200
TELL ME, WHEN DID I
BECOME A PERSON

03:35.233 --> 03:36.533
WHO GETS PATTED ON THE BACK?

03:36.567 --> 03:38.133
YOU THINK
HE'S MOMMY-TRACKING YOU?

03:39.867 --> 03:41.333
WELL, WHAT HAVE YOU HEARD?

03:41.367 --> 03:44.800
HOW ABOUT YOU HANDLE
DENNY DUQUETTE FOR ME TODAY?

03:44.833 --> 03:46.833
ABSOLUTELY.
THANK YOU, DR. BURKE.

03:46.867 --> 03:48.700
OKAY.

03:48.733 --> 03:51.367
I BROUGHT YOU A COFFEE.

03:51.400 --> 03:54.333
OH, THANKS.
VERY THOUGHTFUL.

03:54.367 --> 03:56.400
WHAT?

03:56.433 --> 03:58.567
OH, NOTHING.
I'M JUST DRAGGING A LITTLE.

03:58.600 --> 04:00.500
I ONLY DID 2 MILES
THIS MORNING.

04:00.533 --> 04:02.533
O'MALLEY AND I WERE UP TO 6.
WE PUSHED EACH OTHER.

04:02.567 --> 04:04.767
AH, YOU'RE MISSING GEORGE.

04:04.800 --> 04:07.700
NO. NO, OF COURSE NOT.
DRINK YOUR COFFEE.

04:07.733 --> 04:09.833
OH, THAT'S ALL RIGHT.
ACTUALLY, I'M WAITING ON--

04:09.867 --> 04:12.767
OH, CAPPUCCINO.
HEY, O'MALLEY.

04:12.800 --> 04:13.567
(chuckles)

04:13.600 --> 04:16.367
BIG NEWS--
EUGENE FOOTE IS HERE.

04:16.400 --> 04:17.833
HE'S HAVING PROBLEMS
WITH HIS PACEMAKER.

04:17.867 --> 04:19.733
EUGENE FOOTE IS HERE?
HERE IN THIS HOSPITAL?
UH-HUH.

04:19.767 --> 04:22.167
WHO IS EUGENE FOOTE?

04:22.200 --> 04:23.533
GENIUS VIOLINIST.
BURKE'S HERO.

04:23.567 --> 04:26.067
BURKE FLEW DOWN
TO SAN FRANCISCO LAST YEAR

04:26.100 --> 04:27.500
TO PUT IN HIS PACEMAKER.

04:27.533 --> 04:29.100
BURKE HAS, LIKE,
40 OF HIS ALBUMS.
NO, 42.

04:29.133 --> 04:32.633
ACTUALLY 43 BECAUSE YOU JUST
GOT THE GREATEST HITS ON DVD.
OH, RIGHT, RIGHT.

04:32.667 --> 04:33.600
YEAH.

04:33.633 --> 04:35.067
YOU WANT IN ON FOOTE?
YES.

04:35.100 --> 04:37.167
BUT I'M ON NEURO TODAY
WITH DR. SHEPHERD.

04:37.200 --> 04:39.100
OH, OKAY.

04:39.133 --> 04:41.500
EUGENE... (hums)

04:41.533 --> 04:43.433
I WANT IN. HELLO?
I WANT IN.

04:43.467 --> 04:46.133
HMM. OH, SURE.
YEAH, RIGHT.

04:46.167 --> 04:47.333
(sighs) BURKE, UM,

04:47.367 --> 04:50.233
I LAID ON TOP OF YOU
NAKED LAST NIGHT,

04:50.267 --> 04:54.067
SO WHY DON'T YOU
WAX NOSTALGIC ABOUT THAT?

04:56.367 --> 04:58.267
OBVIOUSLY, I CAN'T
GO OUT WITH HIM, RIGHT?

04:58.300 --> 05:00.200
DO I LOOK LIKE
A CHICK TO YOU?

05:00.233 --> 05:02.133
DO I LOOK LIKE I CARE ABOUT

05:02.167 --> 05:03.667
YEAST CREAM
OR TINGLING FEELINGS?

05:03.700 --> 05:05.600
I MEAN, HE'S NOT IN JAIL
OR ON DRUGS

05:05.633 --> 05:08.167
OR KEEPING BODY PARTS
IN HIS BASEMENT.

05:08.200 --> 05:10.533
YOU WANT TO DO HIM,
DO HIM.
NOT "DO HIM," DATE HIM.

05:10.567 --> 05:12.833
I'M NOT DOING ANYBODY.
I'M KNITTING.

05:12.867 --> 05:14.767
AND I NEED
EUGENE FOOTE'S CHART.

05:14.800 --> 05:17.067
OH. WHO ARE WE TALKING ABOUT?
IT'S WEIRD, RIGHT?

05:17.100 --> 05:19.800
I MEAN, HE'S DEREK'S VET,
HE'S DOC'S VET, HE'S MY VET.

05:19.833 --> 05:21.667
HE'S McVET.

05:21.700 --> 05:23.533
IT'S WEIRD TO DATE HIM,
RIGHT?

05:23.567 --> 05:25.500
WAIT, DID YOU SAY "VET"?
MM-HMM.

05:25.533 --> 05:26.600
LIKE ANIMALS?

05:26.633 --> 05:29.300
OH, YOU CAN'T DATE A VET.
HE'S NOT EVEN A REAL DOCTOR.

05:29.333 --> 05:30.500
DAMN IT!

05:30.533 --> 05:33.133
(muttering) SEX...
HOT SEX...

05:33.167 --> 05:35.533
I NEED THAT.
HA HA, VERY FUNNY.

05:35.567 --> 05:37.600
MUST NOT HAVE GONE
SO WELL THIS MORNING.

05:37.633 --> 05:38.567
WHAT?

05:38.600 --> 05:40.500
JUST RUN
IF SHE LOOKS AT YOU.

05:40.533 --> 05:43.067
I NEED AN INTERN, NOW.

05:43.067 --> 05:44.367
I'M WITH BAILEY.
I'M WITH BURKE.

05:44.400 --> 05:46.567
(sighs) KAREV.

05:46.600 --> 05:49.600
I DON'T DO VAGINA,
NOT AS A DOCTOR ANYWAY.

05:49.633 --> 05:51.567
OH, BACK TALK.
YOU KNOW WHAT?

05:51.600 --> 05:52.833
YOU JUST BOUGHT YOURSELF
A CASE.

05:52.867 --> 05:54.767
HOW YOU FEELING
THIS MORNING, DENNY?

05:54.800 --> 05:55.833
GREAT.

05:55.867 --> 05:58.100
I'D BE EVEN GREATER IF YOU'D
GET ME OFF THIS MACHINE.

05:58.133 --> 05:59.433
DENNY, YOU KNOW I WOULD,

05:59.467 --> 06:01.367
BUT THEN YOUR HEART
WOULD STOP BEATING,

06:01.400 --> 06:03.500
AND DR. BURKE WOULD YELL
AT ME, AND THAT WOULD MAKE

06:03.533 --> 06:05.367
FOR A VERY BAD DAY
FOR BOTH OF US.

06:05.400 --> 06:07.233
IS HE A CANDIDATE
FOR THE PORTABLE LVAD?

06:07.267 --> 06:09.300
NOW, SEE, THAT'S WHAT
I'M TALKIN' ABOUT.

06:09.333 --> 06:11.233
HALF THE SIZE,
TWICE THE FUN.

06:11.267 --> 06:13.667
(Miranda) UH, YOU'VE BEEN DOING
YOUR RESEARCH, HUH?
I HAVE.

06:13.700 --> 06:15.733
I'VE ALREADY TOLD HIM
HE'S NOT READY FOR IT YET.

06:15.767 --> 06:18.233
DR. STEVENS, DIDN'T I ASSIGN YOU
TO NEURO THIS MORNING?

06:18.267 --> 06:20.433
YEAH. I WAS O--
I'M ON MY WAY.

06:20.467 --> 06:23.533
BUT COULD YOU TELL HIM
ABOUT THE COMPLICATIONS?

06:23.567 --> 06:26.267
YOU'D BE RISKING
AIR EMBOLUS, V-FIB.

06:26.300 --> 06:28.333
YEAH, AND THE TUBING COULD
KINK INSIDE OF YOUR BODY,

06:28.367 --> 06:30.700
IN WHICH CASE, WE'D HAVE TO
RUSH YOU TO EMERGENCY SURGERY.

06:30.733 --> 06:32.700
(Miranda) DR. STEVENS,
UNLESS MR. DUQUETTE'S HEART

06:32.733 --> 06:34.100
HAS SUDDENLY GROWN A BRAIN,

06:34.133 --> 06:36.467
YOU ARE CURRENTLY
NOT DOING YOUR JOB.

06:36.500 --> 06:38.567
I'M GOING.
JUST DON'T BE STUPID, OKAY?

06:38.600 --> 06:41.100
YOU'RE NOT THE BOSS OF ME
TODAY, WOMAN.

06:44.200 --> 06:46.200
I WANT YOU TO TAKE IT OUT.

06:46.233 --> 06:47.400
TAKE IT OUT?

06:47.433 --> 06:49.333
BUT, MR. FOOTE,
YOUR HEART FUNCTION

06:49.367 --> 06:51.500
HAS IMPROVED EXPONENTIALLY
SINCE WE PUT THE PACEMAKER IN.

06:51.533 --> 06:53.067
THE SETTING IS WORKING WELL.

06:53.067 --> 06:55.067
YOU KNOW MY MUSIC,
DR. BURKE.

06:55.100 --> 06:57.600
VERY WELL, SIR.
IT CHANGED MY LIFE.

06:57.633 --> 07:00.433
WELL, YOUR CONTRAPTION
HAS CHANGED MY HEARTBEAT.

07:00.467 --> 07:02.367
IT CHANGED MY RHYTHM.
I CAN'T PLAY.

07:02.400 --> 07:05.267
AND THAT'S A SACRIFICE
I AM UNWILLING TO MAKE.

07:05.300 --> 07:07.200
UH, BUT YOU'D BE WILLING
TO SACRIFICE YOUR LIFE

07:07.233 --> 07:09.167
FOR YOUR MUSIC?

07:09.200 --> 07:10.700
THEY'RE ONE AND THE SAME.

07:12.300 --> 07:13.600
BEFORE WE DO
ANYTHING DRASTIC,

07:13.633 --> 07:16.767
JUST LET ME TRY ONE MORE SETTING
ON THE PACEMAKER.

07:16.800 --> 07:21.200
ONE MORE SETTING,
MR. FOOTE.

07:21.233 --> 07:24.167
PLEASE.

07:27.167 --> 07:29.067
OKAY, SURE.

07:29.067 --> 07:30.833
(mouths word)

07:30.867 --> 07:32.767
(boy) I WANT TO PLAY
WITH THE RED ONE.

07:32.800 --> 07:34.467
HELLO, WARDS.

07:34.500 --> 07:36.133
HEY.

07:36.167 --> 07:38.067
WE'RE JUST WAITING
ON YOUR LABS.

07:38.100 --> 07:39.800
HOW ARE YOU FEELING?

07:39.833 --> 07:42.200
I'M FEELING LARGE.
LARGE AND COW-LIKE.

07:42.233 --> 07:45.067
A COW?
MOMMY IS A COW

07:45.067 --> 07:47.567
WHO NEEDS A QUIET TALK
WITH THE DOCTOR.

07:47.600 --> 07:49.400
HEY, GUYS,
WHO WANTS ICE CREAM?

07:49.433 --> 07:51.533
(girl) I WANT CHOCOLATE.

07:51.567 --> 07:53.333
(girl)
DO THEY HAVE STRAWBERRY?

07:53.367 --> 07:57.367
(Alex) UH, C.B.C.
AND CHEM-7 LOOK FINE.

07:58.667 --> 08:00.600
ROSE?

08:00.633 --> 08:03.267
(sighs) SORRY.

08:04.767 --> 08:06.100
I'M SO TIRED.

08:06.133 --> 08:08.067
OH, ROSE, 6 KIDS,
38 WEEKS PREGNANT--

08:08.067 --> 08:09.333
A SAINT WOULD BE TIRED.

08:09.367 --> 08:12.667
WELL... I'M NO SAINT.

08:14.700 --> 08:18.267
THIS BABY... JOSEPH...

08:18.300 --> 08:21.400
DR. SHEPHERD,
I NEED HIM TO BE MY LAST.

08:21.433 --> 08:24.067
AND I REALLY SEEM TO BE
THE MOST FERTILE WOMAN

08:24.067 --> 08:26.500
ON THE PLANET.
WELL, IF YOU'RE INTERESTED

08:26.533 --> 08:29.167
IN ALTERNATIVE FORMS
OF BIRTH CONTROL, I--
NO.

08:29.200 --> 08:30.767
WHAT I MEAN IS...

08:30.800 --> 08:36.067
TODAY, DURING THE C-SECTION,
I NEED YOU TO TIE MY TUBES.

08:37.200 --> 08:41.667
AND I NEED YOU TO DO IT
WITHOUT MY HUSBAND EVER KNOWING.

08:58.333 --> 08:59.833
ROSE, YOU'RE AN ADULT.

08:59.867 --> 09:01.433
HE'S YOUR HUSBAND,
NOT YOUR LEGAL GUARDIAN.

09:01.467 --> 09:03.700
TELLING HIM WOULD BE
ENTIRELY UP TO YOU.

09:03.733 --> 09:05.767
WELL, IF YOU CHARGED
MY INSURANCE, HE WOULD SEE IT.

09:05.800 --> 09:07.633
ANY BILL YOU SENT,
HE WOULD SEE IT.

09:07.667 --> 09:10.467
I'VE BEEN SAVING FOR THIS,
AND I CAN PAY YOU PRIVATELY.

09:10.500 --> 09:12.400
SO YOU'RE SAYING YOU WANT ME
TO DO THE SURGERY

09:12.433 --> 09:14.333
AND LEAVE NO RECORD OF IT?

09:14.367 --> 09:16.367
MRS. WARD,
IF YOU'RE BEING ABUSED,

09:16.400 --> 09:18.700
THERE ARE PEOPLE
YOU CAN TALK TO.

09:18.733 --> 09:21.767
OH, CHRIS IS--
HE'S THE OPPOSITE OF ABUSIVE.

09:21.800 --> 09:23.500
SO IF WE PULL UP
YOUR MEDICAL RECORDS,

09:23.533 --> 09:25.433
WE'RE NOT GONNA FIND A BUNCH
OF OLD BROKEN BONES OR--

09:25.467 --> 09:26.833
IF YOU PULL UP
MY MEDICAL RECORDS,

09:26.867 --> 09:28.567
YOU'LL FIND
THREE NATURAL CHILD BIRTHS,

09:28.600 --> 09:31.567
THREE C-SECTIONS, TWO
HOSPITAL STAYS FOR EXHAUSTION

09:31.600 --> 09:33.733
AND ONE FOR DEHYDRATION

09:33.767 --> 09:35.667
BECAUSE I WAS SO BUSY
CHASING MY KIDS AROUND,

09:35.700 --> 09:38.567
I FORGOT TO TAKE A SIP OF WATER
FOR THREE DAYS.

09:38.600 --> 09:42.367
I THINK GOD UNDERSTANDS
WHAT I'M GOING THROUGH.

09:42.400 --> 09:44.300
AND I THINK GOD
WILL FORGIVE ME.

09:44.333 --> 09:46.200
BUT CHRIS--FOR HIM,

09:46.233 --> 09:48.600
RELIGION ISN'T LIKE
A BUFFET TABLE,

09:48.633 --> 09:51.500
WHERE YOU GET TO CHOSE WHAT YOU
WANT TO TAKE AND LEAVE THE REST.

09:51.533 --> 09:53.500
AND THE POPE SAYS NO
TO BIRTH CONTROL.

09:53.533 --> 09:55.567
SO... I NEED YOUR HELP.

09:55.600 --> 09:57.467
YOU DON'T NEED OUR HELP.

09:57.500 --> 10:00.467
YOUR HUSBAND IS NOT ABUSING YOU,
AND YOU DON'T GET TO LIE TO HIM

10:00.500 --> 10:03.367
AND BLAME IT ON THE POPE.

10:03.400 --> 10:04.733
DR. KAREV--

10:04.767 --> 10:06.667
NO OFFENSE, BUT I HAVE
NO INTEREST IN OBSTETRICS

10:06.700 --> 10:08.200
OR GYNECOLOGY, DR. SHEPHERD,

10:08.233 --> 10:11.100
SO IF YOU WANT TO THROW ME
OFF THE CASE, FEEL FREE.

10:11.133 --> 10:14.733
DR. KAREV, I MAY BE
A BOARD CERTIFIED O.B.G.Y.N.,

10:14.767 --> 10:16.800
BUT I ALSO HAVE FELLOWSHIPS
IN MATERNAL-FETAL MEDICINE

10:16.833 --> 10:18.300
AND MEDICAL GENETICS,

10:18.333 --> 10:20.767
AND I AM ONE OF THE FOREMOST
NEONATAL SURGEONS

10:20.800 --> 10:22.300
IN THIS COUNTRY.

10:22.333 --> 10:24.400
WHEN YOU CAN TOP THAT,
YOU CAN MOUTH OFF.

10:24.433 --> 10:26.833
UNTIL THEN,
YOU WILL DO YOUR JOB,

10:26.867 --> 10:28.767
AND YOU WILL DO IT RIGHT,
WHICH AT THIS POINT IN TIME,

10:28.800 --> 10:30.700
MEANS YOU KEEP YOUR MOUTH SHUT

10:30.733 --> 10:33.033
UNLESS I GIVE YOU PERMISSION
TO OPEN IT.

10:33.067 --> 10:34.833
UNDERSTOOD?

10:34.867 --> 10:37.700
UNDERSTOOD?
OH, ARE YOU GIVING ME
PERMISSION NOW?

10:40.767 --> 10:42.267
GOOD MORNING, MS. GRABER.

10:42.300 --> 10:44.200
OH, REALLY? "GOOD MORNING"?

10:44.233 --> 10:46.200
MM-HMM.
YOU HAVEN'T LET ME SLEEP
IN THREE NIGHTS.

10:46.233 --> 10:48.400
AND THIS RIDICULOUS HAT IS
DESTROYING MY SELF-ESTEEM,

10:48.433 --> 10:49.600
AND I STILL HAVEN'T HAD
A SEIZURE.

10:49.633 --> 10:52.433
BUT, OKAY, SURE.
WE'LL GO WITH "GOOD MORNING"

10:52.467 --> 10:54.367
IF IT MAKES YOU FEEL BETTER
ABOUT YOURSELF.
MS. GRABER IS HERE
FOR BRAIN MAPPING. DR. STEVENS?

10:54.400 --> 10:56.367
BRAIN MAPPING--IT'S WHERE
YOU LOCATE THE AREA OF THE BRAIN

10:56.400 --> 10:58.300
WHERE THE SEIZURES ORIGINATE
AND SURGICALLY REMOVE IT

10:58.333 --> 11:01.533
WITH MINIMAL DAMAGE
TO THE SURROUNDING TISSUE.
(Derek) EXCELLENT.

11:01.567 --> 11:03.100
EXCELLENT EXCEPT FOR THE FACT
THAT IT'S NOT WORKING,

11:03.133 --> 11:04.833
AND I AM LOSING
BILLABLE HOURS.

11:04.867 --> 11:08.700
UNLESS ANY OF YOU ARE LOOKING
TO GET OUT OF A BAD MARRIAGE.

11:08.733 --> 11:09.633
NO.
NO.

11:09.667 --> 11:12.267
DR. SHEPHERD?
YES. NO.
I'M FINE, THANK YOU.

11:12.300 --> 11:14.400
REALLY?
YES.

11:14.433 --> 11:16.333
'CAUSE I'M AN EXCELLENT
DIVORCE ATTORNEY.
I'M SURE YOU ARE.

11:16.367 --> 11:18.267
AND THERE WAS A LOOK,
YOU KNOW, BETWEEN THESE TWO.

11:18.300 --> 11:19.400
A LOOK?

11:19.433 --> 11:20.367
NO.
NO.

11:20.400 --> 11:21.767
WHAT IS IT,
YOU MARRIED YOUNG

11:21.800 --> 11:23.600
AND NOW YOU HAVE
NOTHING IN COMMON?

11:23.633 --> 11:25.800
OH, NO, DON'T TELL ME.
I KNOW.

11:25.833 --> 11:28.800
THE CONVERSATION IS STILL GOOD,
BUT THE SEX HAS GONE TO POT?

11:28.833 --> 11:31.633
MAKE HER SEIZE? HOW DO WE
MAKE SOMEONE HAVE A SEIZURE?

11:31.667 --> 11:33.300
DO YOUR RESEARCH,
GET CREATIVE.

11:33.333 --> 11:35.233
BUT IF ALL THE NORMAL METHODS
HAVE FAILED,

11:35.267 --> 11:36.633
THEN WHAT ARE WE
SUPPOSED TO DO?

11:36.667 --> 11:38.333
USE A STROBE LIGHT,
GET HER DRUNK,

11:38.367 --> 11:40.100
HANG HER FROM THE CEILING
UPSIDE DOWN AND HIT HER

11:40.133 --> 11:41.800
WITH A WIFFLE BALL BAT
FOR ALL I CARE, OKAY?

11:41.833 --> 11:43.733
JUST MAKE HER SEIZE,
BECAUSE UNTIL SHE SEIZES,

11:43.767 --> 11:45.667
I DON'T KNOW WHERE TO OPERATE,
AND IF I DON'T KNOW

11:45.700 --> 11:48.100
WHERE TO OPERATE, I CAN'T GET
THIS WOMAN OUT OF MY LIFE,

11:48.133 --> 11:51.100
AND THIS WOMAN IS NOT
HOW I LIKE TO START MY MORNINGS.

11:55.367 --> 11:57.233
I'M JUST CURIOUS, GEORGE.

11:57.267 --> 11:59.167
CURIOUS GEORGE. (laughs)

11:59.200 --> 12:00.633
GET IT?

12:00.667 --> 12:03.833
NEVER MIND. ALL I'M ASKING
IS WHERE YOU LIVE.

12:03.867 --> 12:06.367
LISTEN TO THIS, THERE'S
AN OLD-SCHOOL ARCADE GAME

12:06.400 --> 12:08.133
THAT'S BEEN KNOWN
TO INDUCE SEIZURES

12:08.167 --> 12:11.233
IF YOU REACH LEVEL 53.
OUR DIVORCE LAWYER

12:11.267 --> 12:13.567
IS SO NOT PLAYING
AN ARCADE GAME FOR 53 LEVELS.

12:13.600 --> 12:16.100
OH, GEORGE, BY THE WAY,
UM, WHERE DO YOU LIVE?

12:16.133 --> 12:19.067
I'M BUSY DOCTORING, DR. STEVENS.
NO TIME FOR CHITCHAT.

12:20.533 --> 12:21.733
MORNING, DR. O'MALLEY.

12:23.667 --> 12:26.433
UH, MORNING, DR. TORRES.

12:26.467 --> 12:29.300
(chuckles)

12:29.333 --> 12:31.400
SO GUESS WHAT.

12:31.433 --> 12:34.333
(George and Callie
whispering indistinctly)

12:34.367 --> 12:36.533
FIGURES.
MM-HMM.

12:36.567 --> 12:38.700
(George and Callie
whispering indistinctly)

12:38.733 --> 12:42.433
DR. O'MALLEY,
HOW'S ALL THAT DOCTORING GOING?

12:44.400 --> 12:47.400
(playing classical music)

13:01.067 --> 13:04.100
YOU TELL ME.

13:04.133 --> 13:06.633
IT'S AN HONOR TO HEAR YOU PLAY.

13:06.667 --> 13:09.433
TOO GOOD A MAN TO LIE.

13:09.467 --> 13:11.333
I'LL READ YOUR MIND.

13:11.367 --> 13:13.600
HIS TIMING IS OFF,
HIS RHYTHM IS OFF.

13:13.633 --> 13:18.133
THIS MAN HAS NO BUSINESS
CALLING HIMSELF EUGENE FOOTE.

13:18.167 --> 13:21.267
YOU UNDERSTAND, SIR,
THAT IN THE MONTHS

13:21.300 --> 13:23.233
SINCE THE INITIAL SURGERY,

13:23.267 --> 13:27.667
SCAR TISSUE HAS FORMED
AROUND THE PACEMAKER?

13:27.700 --> 13:31.667
REMOVING IT IS NOT NEARLY
AS SIMPLE AS IT SOUNDS.

13:33.800 --> 13:36.600
I PICKED UP THE VIOLIN
AT 6 YEARS OLD.

13:36.633 --> 13:39.467
IT WAS IN
MY GRANDFATHER'S ATTIC.

13:39.500 --> 13:41.700
I DIDN'T EVEN KNOW
WHAT IT WAS.

13:41.733 --> 13:44.700
BUT I REMEMBER PICKING IT UP...

13:44.733 --> 13:48.067
THAT MOMENT.

13:48.067 --> 13:52.600
I REMEMBER PUTTING THE BOW
TO THE STRINGS

13:52.633 --> 13:53.767
AND PULLING.

13:53.800 --> 13:59.333
(plays violin note)

13:59.367 --> 14:02.267
JUST THAT.

14:02.300 --> 14:04.400
JUST THAT SCREECHY
LITTLE CHIRP,

14:04.433 --> 14:06.200
AND THAT WAS IT.

14:06.233 --> 14:09.300
I WAS HOOKED.

14:09.333 --> 14:12.367
YOU REMEMBER A MOMENT
LIKE THAT IN YOUR LIFE?

14:16.067 --> 14:18.800
I KNOW THE SURGERY
COULD KILL ME.

14:18.833 --> 14:21.267
I ALSO KNOW
YOU'RE THE BEST,

14:21.300 --> 14:25.133
WHICH MAKES YOU
MY BEST SHOT AT SURVIVAL.

14:25.167 --> 14:28.533
I'D LIKE YOU TO BE THE ONE
TO OPERATE, DR. BURKE.

14:28.567 --> 14:32.200
BUT IF YOU WON'T...

14:32.233 --> 14:36.067
I'LL FIND SOMEONE WHO WILL.

14:42.700 --> 14:44.200
HE'S RIGHT.

14:44.233 --> 14:45.567
WHAT, HE CAN'T PLAY?

14:45.600 --> 14:48.200
HE CAN'T PLAY
LIKE EUGENE FOOTE.

14:48.233 --> 14:50.367
OKAY. SO, UH, SURGERY?

14:50.400 --> 14:53.267
HE SAYS HE WILL GO
SOMEWHERE ELSE IF I REFUSE.

14:53.300 --> 14:54.633
I MIGHT LET HIM.

14:54.667 --> 14:56.067
WHY?

14:57.233 --> 14:59.633
OH, YOU CAN'T LET HIM
GO SOMEWHERE ELSE.

14:59.667 --> 15:01.533
WHAT ARE YOU...

15:06.767 --> 15:09.333
OKAY, WHAT IF IT WERE YOU?

15:09.367 --> 15:12.767
WHAT IF YOU COULDN'T BE
A SURGEON ANYMORE?

15:12.800 --> 15:16.367
OR YOU COULD STILL BE ONE,
BUT--BUT NOT A GREAT ONE?

15:16.400 --> 15:18.100
JUST AVERAGE.

15:18.133 --> 15:20.233
HE COULD GET HIS SURGERY
SOMEWHERE ELSE,

15:20.267 --> 15:23.700
BUT THAT SURGEON
MIGHT BE AVERAGE.

15:28.333 --> 15:33.533
E.K.G., ECHO AND NUCLEAR
ALL WITHIN NORMAL LIMITS.

15:33.567 --> 15:35.467
WELL, DENNY,
IN THAT CASE,

15:35.500 --> 15:38.467
I SEE NO REASON
WHY YOU CAN'T BE UP WALKING.

15:38.500 --> 15:40.833
MUSIC TO MY EARS,
DR. BAILEY.

15:40.867 --> 15:43.300
GOOD. UH, SO DO YOU HAVE
ANY QUESTIONS?

15:43.333 --> 15:44.700
NO, IT'S...

15:44.733 --> 15:46.133
WE COULD PUT IT OFF.

15:46.167 --> 15:48.067
NO HARM IN WAITING
A FEW WEEKS

15:48.100 --> 15:50.667
IF YOU HAVE QUESTIONS,
IF YOU'RE WORRIED.

15:50.700 --> 15:52.800
I'VE GOT 20 TUBES
COMIN' OUT OF MY BODY,

15:52.833 --> 15:56.167
ONE OF WHICH GOES DIRECTLY
INTO MY YOU KNOW WHAT.

15:56.200 --> 15:58.833
AT SOME POINT, I'D LIKE
TO USE THAT YOU KNOW WHAT

15:58.867 --> 16:00.767
FOR SOMETHING BESIDES
PEEING INTO A BAG.

16:00.800 --> 16:03.133
LIKE, FOR INSTANCE,
PEEING INTO A TOILET.

16:03.167 --> 16:04.600
IT'S JUST...

16:04.633 --> 16:07.067
(sighs)

16:07.067 --> 16:09.133
IZZIE GAVE ME MEDICAL ADVICE.

16:09.167 --> 16:11.133
YOU'RE GIVING ME
DIFFERENT ADVICE.

16:11.167 --> 16:15.333
IT JUST SO HAPPENS THAT YOURS
IS THE ADVICE I WANT TO HEAR.

16:15.367 --> 16:18.167
WELL, DR. BAILEY
OUTRANKS DR. STEVENS,

16:18.200 --> 16:19.500
SO IT'S SAFE TO SAY

16:19.533 --> 16:21.600
DR. BAILEY'S ADVICE
IS THE ONE TO FOLLOW.

16:21.633 --> 16:24.267
THAT'S NOT WHAT
HE'S WORRIED ABOUT, DR. GREY.

16:24.300 --> 16:27.400
HE'S WORRIED THAT DR. STEVENS
MIGHT GET HER EGO BRUISED

16:27.433 --> 16:29.100
AND HER FEELINGS HURT.

16:29.133 --> 16:31.533
AM I RIGHT?

16:31.567 --> 16:33.067
NO, NO. DEFINITELY NO.

16:33.067 --> 16:34.167
BECAUSE IT WOULD CONCERN ME

16:34.200 --> 16:36.100
IF YOU WERE MAKING
MEDICAL DECISIONS

16:36.133 --> 16:38.833
BASED ON HOW OUR DR. STEVENS
MIGHT FEEL ABOUT IT.

16:38.867 --> 16:41.500
WELL, IN THAT CASE,
I SAY WE--WE DO THIS THING.

16:41.533 --> 16:43.667
SCREW THAT DIZZY BLONDE
DOCTOR GIRL.

16:43.700 --> 16:46.533
THAT'S NOT HELPING, DENNY.
NO?

16:46.567 --> 16:48.333
NO.
NO.

16:48.367 --> 16:51.267
WHAT'S GOIN' ON BETWEEN
STEVENS AND DENNY?

16:51.300 --> 16:53.200
IS IT A CRUSH,
IS IT AN INNOCENT FLIRTATION,

16:53.233 --> 16:55.500
OR IS STEVENS ACTUALLY
CROSSING THE LINE?

16:55.533 --> 16:58.467
I KNOW SHE LIKES HIM. I CAN'T
IMAGINE IZZIE WOULD DO THAT.

16:58.500 --> 17:00.400
UH-HUH. I COULDN'T IMAGINE
YOU AND YANG

17:00.433 --> 17:02.833
WOULD BE STUPID ENOUGH
TO FALL FOR YOUR ATTENDINGS,

17:02.867 --> 17:05.233
BUT I WAS WRONG ABOUT THAT,
WASN'T I?

17:05.267 --> 17:07.433
I'M KNITTING THESE DAYS.

17:07.467 --> 17:08.633
PLUS, I'M THINKING ABOUT

17:08.667 --> 17:10.567
ACCEPTING A DATE
WITH A VETERINARIAN.

17:10.600 --> 17:13.233
GREY, DO YOU ACTUALLY BELIEVE
I CARE?

17:13.267 --> 17:14.800
NO.

17:14.833 --> 17:18.167
GOOD. MAYBE YOU'RE NOT
SO STUPID AFTER ALL.

17:21.167 --> 17:23.467
ALL RIGHT,
EXPLAIN TO ME ONE MORE TIME

17:23.500 --> 17:25.400
EXACTLY WHAT THIS
IS SUPPOSED TO DO?

17:25.433 --> 17:27.333
HAVING THE TV THIS CLOSE
MAKES THE FLICKERING

17:27.367 --> 17:29.267
AND FLASHING BIGGER
AND MORE INTENSE,

17:29.300 --> 17:30.633
WHICH CAN CAUSE SEIZURES.

17:30.667 --> 17:33.500
OH, WELL, NORMALLY, I DON'T
HAVE TIME TO WATCH TV.

17:33.533 --> 17:36.067
BUT THIS WEEK
I'VE DISCOVERED OPRAH.

17:36.100 --> 17:37.833
YOU KNOW, SHE'S FAMOUS IN
MY BUSINESS FOR NEVER MARRYING

17:37.867 --> 17:40.067
THAT BOYFRIEND OF HERS.

17:40.100 --> 17:41.333
WISE, WISE WOMAN.

17:41.367 --> 17:44.367
(music playing on TV)

17:45.867 --> 17:48.133
SO FIRST YOU WON'T TELL ME
WHERE YOU LIVE,

17:48.167 --> 17:50.067
AND NOW, I AM ON THE OUTSIDE

17:50.100 --> 17:51.833
OF YOUR INSIDE JOKES
WITH CALLIE.

17:51.867 --> 17:54.633
WHEN DID I END UP
ON THE OUTSIDE, GEORGE?
YOU'RE NOT ON THE OUTSIDE.

17:54.667 --> 17:57.100
OKAY, NOW YOU'RE LYING
TO MY FACE.
YOU'RE BEING PARANOID.

17:57.133 --> 17:59.300
WELL, I'M NOT SEIZING,

17:59.333 --> 18:01.233
BUT I AM HAVING
AN ACID FLASHBACK.

18:01.267 --> 18:02.800
DOES THAT COUNT?

18:05.367 --> 18:08.233
ROSE... SEVEN KIDS...

18:08.267 --> 18:10.500
IT'S A LOT.

18:10.533 --> 18:13.400
ARE YOU SURE THAT CHRIS ISN'T
FEELING THE SAME WAY?

18:13.433 --> 18:15.333
WHEN WE WERE FIRST MARRIED,
WE WERE SO BROKE

18:15.367 --> 18:17.567
THAT I WENT ON THE PILL
FOR A WHILE,

18:17.600 --> 18:20.333
AND CHRIS STOPPED
TAKING COMMUNION.

18:20.367 --> 18:22.267
WHEN HE DOES THAT,
HE THINKS HE'S--
HE THINKS HE'S GOING TO HELL.

18:22.300 --> 18:25.300
HE THINKS YOU'RE BOTH
GOING TO HELL.

18:25.333 --> 18:28.200
THE REASON WE HAVEN'T HAD
A BABY IN FOUR YEARS,

18:28.233 --> 18:30.300
IS BECAUSE WE ABSTAINED
FOR THREE.

18:30.333 --> 18:32.067
I MEAN, CAN YOU IMAGINE
NOT BEING ABLE

18:32.100 --> 18:34.767
TO MAKE LOVE TO YOUR HUSBAND?

18:34.800 --> 18:36.433
UM...

18:36.467 --> 18:38.833
THE, UH, PILL--

18:38.867 --> 18:40.800
I CAN'T HIDE THE PILL.
HE WOULD FIND OUT.

18:40.833 --> 18:43.600
IF HE FOUND OUT, WHAT,
I MEAN, HE WON'T DIVORCE YOU,

18:43.633 --> 18:45.100
HE DOESN'T BELIEVE IN IT.

18:45.133 --> 18:47.167
DO YOU SEE THE WAY
HE'S LOOKING AT ME RIGHT NOW?

18:47.200 --> 18:48.467
DR. KAREV WAS JUST LEAVING.

18:48.500 --> 18:50.267
NO, NO, NO, NO. JUST...

18:50.300 --> 18:53.600
JUST LOOK AT HIM
FOR A MINUTE.

18:53.633 --> 18:56.067
THAT LOOK HE HAS ON HIS FACE,

18:56.100 --> 18:57.833
THAT'S HOW MY HUSBAND
WOULD LOOK AT ME

18:57.867 --> 19:00.467
IF HE KNEW ABOUT
ANY OF THIS.

19:00.500 --> 19:04.300
AND I CAN'T HAVE MY HUSBAND
LOOK AT ME LIKE THAT.

19:04.333 --> 19:07.667
AND I CAN'T HAVE
ANY MORE BABIES.

19:12.333 --> 19:14.767
FOR THE RECORD...

19:14.800 --> 19:16.400
I AM ON YOUR SIDE TODAY.

19:16.433 --> 19:18.233
GEORGE SUCKS.

19:18.267 --> 19:21.200
MMM. BURKE DOESN'T THINK SO.
HE'S HIS NEW BEST FRIEND.

19:21.233 --> 19:23.067
I WONDER IF BURKE KNOWS
WHERE HE LIVES.

19:23.067 --> 19:24.900
HOW'S DENNY DOING?

19:24.933 --> 19:28.233
BAILEY'S NOT CAVING IN
ON THE LVAD THING, IS SHE?
ABOUT THAT...
I THOUGHT ALEX WAS KIDDING

19:28.267 --> 19:30.300
WHEN HE SAID YOU DUMPED HIM
FOR A HEART PATIENT.

19:30.333 --> 19:33.600
DID YOU REALLY DUMP HIM
FOR A HEART PATIENT?
OF COURSE NOT.

19:33.633 --> 19:35.533
'CAUSE DENNY'S A PATIENT.
WE CAN'T FALL FOR OUR PATIENTS.

19:35.567 --> 19:37.167
YOU'RE FALLING FOR A VET.

19:37.200 --> 19:38.333
I'M CONSIDERING
THE POSSIBILITY

19:38.367 --> 19:40.733
OF MAYBE HAVING A DATE
WITH A VET.

19:40.767 --> 19:43.133
THAT'S ALL I'M SAYING.

19:43.167 --> 19:46.733
MY POINT IS, BAILEY'S ON
THE WARPATH ABOUT YOU AND DENNY,

19:46.767 --> 19:49.567
SO JUST BE CAREFUL.

19:49.600 --> 19:51.500
(Addison) HOW'S
YOUR SPONGE COUNT, DR. KAREV?

19:51.533 --> 19:54.400
THEY'RE ALL ACCOUNTED FOR,
BUT I SEE A BLEEDER HERE.

19:54.433 --> 19:57.300
IT'S SMALL. GET THE BOVIE
AND CAUTERIZE IT.

19:59.200 --> 20:00.500
ALL RIGHT, GOT IT.

20:00.533 --> 20:02.067
THAT'S GOOD.

20:02.100 --> 20:04.700
THERE'S A LITTLE BLEEDING
NEAR THE TUBE HERE.

20:04.733 --> 20:08.067
CAN YOU HAND ME THE BOVIE,
DR. KAREV?

20:11.067 --> 20:12.800
I DON'T SEE
ANY ABNORMAL BLEEDING.

20:12.833 --> 20:15.600
ARE YOU THE SURGEON HERE?

20:15.633 --> 20:17.400
NO.

20:17.433 --> 20:18.733
THEN GIVE ME THE BOVIE.

20:20.433 --> 20:24.433
GIVE ME THE BOVIE,
DR. KAREV.

20:40.633 --> 20:44.700
HEY THERE, JOSEPH.
WELCOME TO THE WORLD.

20:44.733 --> 20:46.633
(chuckles)

20:48.500 --> 20:51.367
ROSE, BEFORE WE BRING
YOUR FAMILY IN TO SEE YOU,

20:51.400 --> 20:53.100
I WANTED TO LET YOU KNOW

20:53.133 --> 20:56.200
THAT THERE WAS A COMPLICATION
WITH YOUR SURGERY.

20:57.667 --> 21:01.067
WE HAD SOME UNEXPECTED BLEEDING
THAT CAUSED DAMAGE

21:01.067 --> 21:03.133
TO BOTH FALLOPIAN TUBES.

21:03.167 --> 21:06.067
SO YOU'RE SAYING...

21:06.067 --> 21:09.567
YOU WON'T BE ABLE TO HAVE
ANY MORE CHILDREN.

21:09.600 --> 21:13.433
THANK YOU, DR. SHEPHERD.

21:15.100 --> 21:19.400
AS I SAID, IT WAS...
A COMPLICATION.

21:19.433 --> 21:21.367
I UNDERSTAND.

21:21.400 --> 21:23.300
A COMPLICATION,
THAT'S WHAT YOU'RE CALLING IT?

21:23.333 --> 21:24.833
THAT'S WHAT IT WAS.
REALLY?

21:24.867 --> 21:26.767
'CAUSE IN THAT CASE,
IT'S ONE OF THE MOST BIZARRE

21:26.800 --> 21:28.833
OBSTETRIC COMPLICATIONS
IN HISTORY.

21:28.867 --> 21:30.533
SHE IS OUR PATIENT.

21:30.567 --> 21:33.433
OUR OBLIGATION IS TO HER
AND HER ONLY.

21:33.467 --> 21:36.467

21:40.300 --> 21:43.300

21:45.100 --> 21:46.067

21:50.767 --> 21:52.800
UH, YOU PICKED UP DOC.

21:52.833 --> 21:54.533
YEAH. HE'S HOME.

21:54.567 --> 21:56.467
HE SEEMS TO BE DOING
MUCH BETTER.

21:56.500 --> 21:58.667
HE SEEMS TO BE
DOING GOOD.

21:58.700 --> 22:00.600
***

22:00.633 --> 22:02.467
(laughs)

22:02.500 --> 22:04.200
I'M NOT LAUGHING AT YOU.

22:04.233 --> 22:05.167
NO?

22:05.200 --> 22:07.067
NO, IT'S JUST, YOU KNOW,

22:07.100 --> 22:11.067
BAD SEX ISN'T REALLY SOMETHING
THAT WIVES WANT ANNOUNCED

22:11.067 --> 22:12.100
TO THE DIRTY EX-MISTRESS.

22:12.133 --> 22:14.667
YOU'RE NOT THE DIRTY
EX-MISTRESS. YOU'RE A FRIEND.

22:14.700 --> 22:16.667
SHE'S YOUR FRIEND.
I'M YOUR FRIEND.

22:16.700 --> 22:18.533
WE'RE FRIENDS.

22:18.567 --> 22:21.467
BUT YOU DIDN'T TELL HER.

22:21.500 --> 22:22.433
(sighs)

22:22.467 --> 22:24.400
NO.

22:24.433 --> 22:25.600
(sighs)
HOW'S YOUR DAY GOING?

22:25.633 --> 22:26.567
GREAT.

22:26.600 --> 22:28.133
GOOD.

22:28.167 --> 22:31.100
THE VET ASKED ME IF WE--

22:31.133 --> 22:33.067
WHAT,
WHAT DID HE ASK YOU?

22:33.067 --> 22:34.567
IF WE WERE TOGETHER.

22:34.600 --> 22:35.533
UH-HUH.

22:35.567 --> 22:38.433
AND I SET HIM STRAIGHT.

22:38.467 --> 22:39.767
***

22:39.800 --> 22:41.467
HAVE A GOOD DAY,

YOU CAN. YOU CAN.

22:48.367 --> 22:50.600
YOU'RE THE BEST
DIVORCE ATTORNEY IN SEATTLE.
(Izzie) YOU'RE THE BEST.

22:50.633 --> 22:53.233
YOU CAN KICK
THAT ESPRESSO SHOT'S ASS.
YOU CAN.

22:53.267 --> 22:55.067
KICK IT. KICK IT.

22:55.067 --> 22:56.200
KICK IT.
YEAH!

22:56.233 --> 22:58.133
WHOA, WHOA, WHOA!
WHAT?

22:58.167 --> 23:00.167
OKAY, GOOD, SO,
CAFFEINE'S FOR SEIZURES.

23:00.200 --> 23:01.700
WHAT'S THE DOUGHNUTS FOR?

23:01.733 --> 23:03.733
THEY ARE TO ABSORB
SOME OF THE COFFEE

23:03.767 --> 23:06.500
SO IT DOESN'T' BURN A HOLE
THROUGH YOUR STOMACH.
GOOD. OKAY. GOOD IDEA.

MMM.

23:10.167 --> 23:10.933
OH.

23:10.967 --> 23:12.633
DO YOU KNOW
HOW LONG IT HAS BEEN

23:12.667 --> 23:16.167
SINCE I HAVE HAD A DOUGHNUT?
(laughs)

23:16.200 --> 23:18.100
I REALLY, REALLY, REALLY,
REALLY, REALLY LIKE DOUGHNUTS.

23:18.133 --> 23:20.067
THEN WHY DON'T YOU
EAT THEM?

23:20.067 --> 23:21.833
GOT TO STAY ON TOP
OF MY GAME.

23:21.867 --> 23:23.600
NO TIME FOR EXERCISE,
NO CARBS, NO SUGAR.

23:23.633 --> 23:25.233
CAN'T HAVE A SUGAR CRASH
IN COURT.

23:25.267 --> 23:26.733
STUPID COURT.

23:26.767 --> 23:28.800
COURT IS STUPID

RIGHT? YOU KNOW?

24:25.367 --> 24:27.267
LIKE FUN THAT WE HAD
AT HOME

24:27.300 --> 24:29.200
BACK WHEN YOU USED TO
TELL ME THINGS,

24:29.233 --> 24:30.400
LIKE WHERE DO YOU LIVE?

24:30.433 --> 24:31.800
DON'T START THAT AGAIN.

24:31.833 --> 24:33.167
I'M NOT STARTING ANYTHING.

24:33.200 --> 24:34.833
I'M JUST SAYING,
THERE'S FUN TO BE HAD.

24:34.867 --> 24:36.633
ALL THE TIME, WITH ME,
YOUR BEST FRIEND.

24:36.667 --> 24:37.767
IT'S NOT LIKE
WE'RE IN HIGH SCHOOL.

TO SAY, JUST SAY IT.

24:41.700 --> 24:43.600
YEAH, LAST TIME
YOU GAVE ME THAT ADVICE,

24:43.633 --> 24:46.200
IT WENT REALLY WELL.
YOU'RE SERIOUSLY PISSED AT ME

24:46.233 --> 24:48.133
BECAUSE OF WHAT HAPPENED
BETWEEN YOU AND MEREDITH?

24:48.167 --> 24:49.367
NO. YEAH.

DOCTORS, WEREN'T YOU?

25:16.567 --> 25:18.433
ROSE WARD.
YES, SIR, I WAS.

25:18.467 --> 25:20.267
SHE JUST TOLD ME
THERE WAS A COMPLICATION

25:20.300 --> 25:22.100
WITH HER C-SECTION.

25:22.133 --> 25:24.067
I TOLD YOU TO TELL HER
HOW YOU FEEL.

25:24.067 --> 25:26.067
I DID NOT TELL YOU
TO JUMP INTO BED WITH HER.
ADULTERY?

25:26.067 --> 25:28.100
WHY DID YOU SEND ME
IN THERE?

25:28.133 --> 25:29.600
WAS IT TO HUMILIATE ME?
NO.

25:29.633 --> 25:30.833
I MEAN, IF YOU KNEW
THAT SHE DIDN'T LOVE ME,

25:30.867 --> 25:32.500
WHY? WHAT KIND OF FRIEND
DOES THAT?

25:32.533 --> 25:33.767
IT'S JUST--
IT WAS SHOCKING.

25:33.800 --> 25:35.700
SOMEONE SAYS
THERE'S A COMPLICATION,

25:35.733 --> 25:38.100
AND EVERYTHING CHANGES.

OH, AND SOME DENIAL.
I CAN WORK WITH THAT.
YOU WANTED TO
KEEP ON LOVING HER.

26:07.800 --> 26:09.167
YOU DID NOT WANT

26:09.200 --> 26:10.833

RESPIRATORY TO DO IT.

MAYBE IT IS.

26:16.100 --> 26:18.633

A BLESSING, I MEAN.

THIS "COMPLICATION."

IT DOESN'T LOOK LIKE
YOU'VE GOT THIS.
I'VE GOT THIS!

OH, MY GOD!
YOU KNEW THE RISK.

26:34.267 --> 26:36.233
YOU KNEW SHE WAS IN LOVE
WITH SOMEONE ELSE.
I'M GETTIN' AN AURA.

26:36.267 --> 26:37.700
I'M NOT
SAYING SHE WASN'T WRONG.

NO! I AM NOT SAYING

WHAT, RESPONSIBILITY?

YOU ARE BEING RIDICULOUS!
SHE'S SEIZING.
GO PAGE SHEPHERD!

27:34.367 --> 27:37.367
THIS COMES FROM NOTHING
RESEMBLING A HIGH HORSE.

27:37.400 --> 27:41.067
HIGH HORSES
WANT NOTHING TO DO WITH ME.

27:41.100 --> 27:42.833
YOU KNOW, THIS THING
WITH YOU AND IZZIE,

27:42.867 --> 27:44.633
IT'S...

27:44.667 --> 27:48.233
THERE ARE STRICT RULES
ABOUT DOCTORS DATING PATIENTS.

27:48.267 --> 27:50.167
YOU KNOW IZZIE
PRETTY WELL, RIGHT?

27:50.200 --> 27:53.067
YOU THINK IF I WENT TO HER
AND I SAID,

27:53.100 --> 27:55.800
"HEY, YOU KNOW, THIS IS GONNA BE
REALLY BAD FOR YOUR CAREER,

27:55.833 --> 27:57.733
"AND YOU PROBABLY SHOULDN'T
COME AROUND

27:57.767 --> 27:59.433
TO SEE ME ANYMORE,"

27:59.467 --> 28:02.067
YOU--YOU THINK THAT'LL HAVE
ANY EFFECT AT ALL?

28:02.100 --> 28:03.800
THE THING IS...

28:03.833 --> 28:07.267
I WAS HEALTHY MY WHOLE LIFE
TILL I WASN'T.

28:07.300 --> 28:09.667
***

28:09.700 --> 28:12.567
AND FOR THE LAST YEAR,
I'VE HAD A LOT OF TIME

28:12.600 --> 28:14.833
TO LAY AROUND IN BED
AND THINK ABOUT MY LIFE.

28:14.867 --> 28:18.667
AND THE THINGS
THAT I REMEMBER BEST...

28:18.700 --> 28:22.533
WELL, THOSE ARE THE THINGS
THAT I WASN'T SUPPOSED TO DO,

28:22.567 --> 28:25.300
AND I DID 'EM ANYWAY.

28:25.333 --> 28:29.100
SO THE THING IS, MEREDITH...

28:29.133 --> 28:33.800
LIFE IS TOO DAMN SHORT
TO BE FOLLOWING ALL THESE RULES.

28:33.833 --> 28:36.100
(Miranda) MAY I ASK

28:36.133 --> 28:37.767
WHAT MOTIVE YOU HAD FOR
UNDERMINING MY AUTHORITY

28:37.800 --> 28:39.767
IN FRONT OF MY PATIENT
AND MY INTERN?

28:39.800 --> 28:42.567
I'M NOT PUNISHING YOU,
DR. BAILEY.
OH, BUT YOU ARE.

28:42.600 --> 28:44.767
I HAD A BABY, AND SO YOU ARE.
YES, YOU HAD A BABY.

28:44.800 --> 28:47.700
AND NOW YOU'RE SLEEP-DEPRIVED.
EVERY DOCTOR IN THIS HOSPITAL
IS SLEEP-DEPRIVED.

28:47.733 --> 28:49.633
YOU JUST CAME BACK
FROM MATERNITY LEAVE,

28:49.667 --> 28:51.800
AND I'M NOT CONVINCED
YOU'RE BACK ON YOUR GAME.

28:51.833 --> 28:54.100
THIS IS NOT A PUNISHMENT

28:54.133 --> 28:56.233
OR A REFLECTION
ON HOW HIGHLY I VALUE YOU.

28:56.267 --> 28:59.700
IT'S JUST THE WAY IT IS.
I'M SORRY
TO INTERRUPT, CHIEF,

28:59.733 --> 29:01.467
BUT THAT MAN OVER THERE
IS ASKING TO TALK TO YOU.

29:01.500 --> 29:03.700
EXCUSE ME.

29:03.733 --> 29:06.733
***

29:10.267 --> 29:12.400
(sighs)

29:12.433 --> 29:14.333
***

29:14.367 --> 29:16.067
(bell on door rings)

29:16.067 --> 29:17.233
WE'RE CLOSED.

29:17.267 --> 29:19.400
HEY.

29:19.433 --> 29:21.333
I THOUGHT YOU WERE
KNITTING A SWEATER.

29:21.367 --> 29:24.067
I AM.
BUT I'M ALSO DATING.

29:24.067 --> 29:27.533
YOU.
IF YOU STILL WANT TO.

29:27.567 --> 29:30.433
***

29:30.467 --> 29:32.267
I SHOULD'VE CALLED.
YOU KNOW, I WAS GOING TO CALL--

29:32.300 --> 29:33.600
NO, NO, UH...

29:33.633 --> 29:35.633
DON'T CALL. NEVER CALL.

29:35.667 --> 29:37.500
ALWAYS SHOW UP.

29:37.533 --> 29:39.300
OKAY.

29:39.333 --> 29:41.500
OKAY. BUT I CAN'T TONIGHT.

29:41.533 --> 29:43.433
I'VE GOT AN ERRAND
I HAVE TO RUN.

29:43.467 --> 29:45.833
I RUN ERRANDS.

29:45.867 --> 29:47.200
THIS SHOULDN'T TAKE TOO LONG,

29:47.233 --> 29:49.133
AND WE CAN GRAB SOME DINNER
RIGHT AFTER.

29:49.167 --> 29:50.400
AFTER?

29:50.433 --> 29:51.767
AFTER SHE GIVES BIRTH.

29:51.800 --> 29:53.400
YOU'RE BIRTHING A HORSE?

29:53.433 --> 29:55.667
YEAH.

29:55.700 --> 29:58.400
THAT WAS YOUR ERRAND?
YOU'RE BIRTHING A HORSE?

29:58.433 --> 29:59.467
YEAH.

29:59.500 --> 30:01.300
I GUESS I-I COULD'VE
MENTIONED IT BEFORE,

30:01.333 --> 30:05.300
BUT, YOU KNOW, I DIDN'T WANT TO
SCARE YOU BACK TO YOUR KNITTING.

30:05.333 --> 30:08.233
(neighing)

30:08.267 --> 30:09.800
SHE'S GETTING ANXIOUS.

30:09.833 --> 30:11.133
YOU CAN WAIT BACK HERE.

30:11.167 --> 30:12.700
BACK HERE?

30:12.733 --> 30:15.133
IF YOU WANT. I MEAN,
IT'S A LITTLE MESSY.

30:15.167 --> 30:17.633
ARE YOU KIDDING?
I WANT TO BIRTH A HORSE.

30:17.667 --> 30:21.633
***

30:23.667 --> 30:26.367
(neighs)

30:27.500 --> 30:29.400
***

30:29.433 --> 30:32.200
RICHARD, WE HAVE TO TALK
ABOUT ALEX KAREV.

30:32.233 --> 30:34.167
I KNOW HE'S TALENTED,
BUT HIS ATTITUDE,

30:34.200 --> 30:36.700
IN MY OPINION, HAS REACHED
AN UNACCEPTABLE LOW.

30:36.733 --> 30:38.767
ADDISON...

30:38.800 --> 30:40.800
YOU'VE GOT
A BIGGER PROBLEM TODAY

30:40.833 --> 30:44.600
THAN ALEX KAREV.

30:44.633 --> 30:47.333
MR. WARD HAS BEEN SPEAKING
WITH OUR ATTORNEY

30:47.367 --> 30:48.500
REGARDING HIS WIFE'S SURGERY.

30:48.533 --> 30:50.567
NOW I READ YOUR CHART.

30:50.600 --> 30:53.067
I READ THE NURSE'S NOTES.

30:53.100 --> 30:56.200
NOW CAN YOU EXPLAIN TO ME
WHAT KIND OF COMPLICATION

30:56.233 --> 30:58.233
FROM A C-SECTION LEADS
TO THE SEVERING

30:58.267 --> 31:00.667
OF BOTH FALLOPIAN TUBES?

31:02.667 --> 31:06.067
(Derek) WELL, THE BAD NEWS IS,
YOU HAD A GRAND MAL SEIZURE.

31:06.067 --> 31:08.767
THE GOOD NEWS IS, WE MAPPED IT,
SO NOW WE CAN OPERATE.

31:08.800 --> 31:12.100
NO. I'VE DECIDED
AGAINST SURGERY, DR. SHEPHERD.

31:12.133 --> 31:13.467
I'M SORRY?

31:13.500 --> 31:15.367
NO OFFENSE.
THE RISKS OF CRANIOTOMY--

31:15.400 --> 31:18.100
WHEN YOU DESCRIBE THEM,
THEY'RE NOT TERRIBLY APPEALING.

31:18.133 --> 31:20.133
YES, THERE ARE RISKS.

31:20.167 --> 31:22.067
BUT YOU HAVE TO WEIGH
THOSE RISKS WITH THE, UH,

31:22.100 --> 31:24.700
DETRIMENTAL EFFECT YOUR SEIZURE
DISORDER HAS ON YOUR LIFE.

31:24.733 --> 31:26.633
UNLESS MY LIFE IS HAVING
A DETRIMENTAL EFFECT

31:26.667 --> 31:28.100
ON MY SEIZURE DISORDER.

31:28.133 --> 31:29.733
IT'S LIKE WITH YOU
AND YOUR WIFE--

31:29.767 --> 31:31.667
IS THE BAD SEX
YOUR BIGGEST PROBLEM,

31:31.700 --> 31:34.267
OR ARE ALL THE BIGGER PROBLEMS
CAUSING THE BAD SEX?

31:34.300 --> 31:37.300
I'M, UH... OH.
I'M NOT GONNA ANSWER THAT.

31:37.333 --> 31:39.333
ALL RIGHT, MY POINT IS,
I HAD MORE FUN TODAY

31:39.367 --> 31:41.233
THAN I CAN REMEMBER.

31:41.267 --> 31:43.167
I DON'T HAVE ANY FRIENDS.
I DON'T HAVE ANY FUN.

31:43.200 --> 31:45.100
I ONLY HAVE WORK.
WORK AND SEIZURES.

31:45.133 --> 31:47.267
AND IT'S NO COINCIDENCE
THAT WHEN THE WORK STOPPED,

31:47.300 --> 31:48.833
THE SEIZURES STOPPED.

31:48.867 --> 31:50.767
UNTIL THESE TWO
STARTED ARGUING.

31:50.800 --> 31:53.633
RIGHT. I'M GONNA TALK TO 'EM
ABOUT THAT.
NO, NO, NO.
YOU DON'T GET IT.

31:53.667 --> 31:54.833
WATCHING PEOPLE FIGHT--UGH!

31:54.867 --> 31:57.267
IT'S BEEN MY WHOLE LIFE
FOR 15 YEARS.

31:57.300 --> 31:58.367
SO I'M CHANGING MY LIFE.

31:58.400 --> 32:00.433
LOOK, AND IF THAT DOESN'T WORK,
I'LL COME BACK HERE

32:00.467 --> 32:02.400
AND LET YOU CUT OPEN
MY BRAIN, OKAY?

32:02.433 --> 32:04.300
ALL RIGHT. FAIR ENOUGH.

32:14.800 --> 32:17.200
(neighs)

32:20.567 --> 32:22.500
IT'S PRETTY GOOD, HUH?

32:22.533 --> 32:25.433
YEAH, IT'S PRETTY GOOD.

32:26.400 --> 32:29.267
(chuckles)

32:33.667 --> 32:37.233
(whinnies)

32:45.633 --> 32:47.467
HOW ARE YOU FEELING?

32:47.500 --> 32:48.667
LITTLE SORE.

32:48.700 --> 32:50.533
WELL, THAT'S TO BE EXPECTED.

32:50.567 --> 32:53.333
(inhales)

32:53.367 --> 32:55.167
(clears throat)

32:56.333 --> 32:59.233
I'M SORRY I TOLD CHRIS
ABOUT THE COMPLICATION.

32:59.267 --> 33:01.167
I JUST...

33:01.200 --> 33:05.533
I JUST THOUGHT HE SHOULD KNOW
THAT JOSEPH WOULD BE OUR LAST

33:05.567 --> 33:08.300
SO HE COULD SAVOR IT.

33:08.333 --> 33:11.500
I DIDN'T KNOW
HE WAS GONNA DO THIS.

33:11.533 --> 33:13.433
ROSE...

33:13.467 --> 33:15.833
I NEED YOU TO TELL HIM
THAT YOU ASKED ME

33:15.867 --> 33:17.800
TO TIE YOUR TUBES.

33:17.833 --> 33:20.200
FOR YOU,
IT'S JUST INSURANCE,

33:20.233 --> 33:22.133
AND YOU DON'T EVEN
HAVE TO PAY.

33:22.167 --> 33:24.067
FOR ME, IT'S MY MARRIAGE.

33:24.100 --> 33:26.200
IT'S MY FAMILY.

33:26.233 --> 33:29.067
IT'S MY CAREER, ROSE.
IT'S MY REPUTATION.

33:30.633 --> 33:32.300
YOU'RE THE BEST.

33:32.333 --> 33:34.233
PEOPLE COME FROM ALL OVER
THE COUNTRY TO SEE YOU.

33:34.267 --> 33:36.367
THAT WON'T CHANGE.

33:36.400 --> 33:38.333
I CAN'T TELL HIM.

33:38.367 --> 33:41.833
DR. SHEPHERD, I--

33:41.867 --> 33:43.200
I'M SO SORRY

33:43.233 --> 33:47.067
BECAUSE I AM SO GRATEFUL
TO YOU.

33:47.067 --> 33:49.833
BUT I CAN'T TELL HIM.

33:49.867 --> 33:51.700
HMM.

33:56.633 --> 33:59.633
(classical violin music
playing)

34:24.400 --> 34:27.600
IS IT COMING OFF?

34:27.633 --> 34:29.667
NOT EXACTLY.

34:29.700 --> 34:31.600
I'M SORRY.

34:31.633 --> 34:33.467
OH, DON'T BE.
IT WAS A GREAT DATE.

34:33.500 --> 34:36.267
TECHNICALLY, IT WASN'T THE DATE.
IT WAS THE ERRAND.

34:36.300 --> 34:39.433
NOW WE COULD GO UP TO MY PLACE,
I COULD COOK FOR YOU.

34:39.467 --> 34:41.300
GO UP TO YOUR PLACE?

34:42.767 --> 34:44.667
DO YOU WANT TO COME UP
TO MY PLACE?

34:44.700 --> 34:46.200
YEAH. I MEAN, NO.

34:46.233 --> 34:48.467
NO, I-I DON'T.

34:48.500 --> 34:50.100
I-I DO, BUT I DON'T.

34:50.133 --> 34:52.333
YOU DON'T KNOW?

34:52.367 --> 34:54.567
NO, I DO. I MEAN, I-I KNOW.
NO, I DON'T.

34:54.600 --> 34:58.133
ALL RIGHT, WELL,
HERE'S THE DEAL.

34:58.167 --> 35:01.233
UM, YOU HAVE TWO OPTIONS.

35:01.267 --> 35:04.733
YOU COULD COME UP TO MY PLACE,
TAKE OFF ALL YOUR CLOTHES,

35:04.767 --> 35:06.833
SHOWER OFF THE GOO,
BORROW ONE OF MY SHIRTS,

35:06.867 --> 35:09.800
AND I'LL COOK YOU DINNER--
THAT'S DOOR NUMBER ONE.

35:09.833 --> 35:13.433
DOOR NUMBER TWO--
YOU GO HOME.

35:13.467 --> 35:15.567
I-I THINK YOU OUGHTA TAKE
DOOR NUMBER ONE,

35:15.600 --> 35:18.467
BECAUSE, YOU KNOW, IT INVOLVES
YOU NAKED IN MY APARTMENT,

35:18.500 --> 35:20.667
BUT, YOU KNOW,
THAT'S JUST ME.

35:20.700 --> 35:22.600
I SHOULD POINT OUT THAT

35:22.633 --> 35:24.533
THERE IS ABSOLUTELY NOTHING
YOU COULD SAY

35:24.567 --> 35:26.233
THAT WOULD MAKE ME GO
UPSTAIRS WITH YOU.

35:26.267 --> 35:28.100
I'M KIND OF OFFENDED

35:28.133 --> 35:30.600
THAT YOU THINK THAT I WOULD
GO UPSTAIRS WITH YOU.

35:30.633 --> 35:33.800
AND YOU SHOULD KNOW
THAT I... AM CELIBATE.

35:33.833 --> 35:36.100
SO--
SHUT UP.

35:37.533 --> 35:42.433
I ABSOLUTELY CANNOT HAVE...

35:42.467 --> 35:45.400
SEX WITH YOU.

35:45.433 --> 35:47.333
IF YOU CHOOSE DOOR NUMBER ONE,

35:47.367 --> 35:51.367
I ABSOLUTELY WILL NOT
HAVE SEX WITH YOU.

35:51.400 --> 35:53.067
YOU WON'T?
I PROMISE I WON'T.

35:53.100 --> 35:55.067
I WON'T EVEN TRY
AND KISS YOU.
WHY NOT?

35:55.100 --> 35:56.767
MEREDITH.
WHAT?

35:56.800 --> 35:58.667
CHOOSE DOOR NUMBER ONE.

35:58.700 --> 36:00.600
A WISE MAN ONCE SAID

36:00.633 --> 36:02.533
YOU CAN HAVE ANYTHING IN LIFE

36:02.567 --> 36:04.467
IF YOU WILL SACRIFICE
EVERYTHING ELSE FOR IT.

36:04.500 --> 36:06.767
I HOPE IT WORKS...

36:06.800 --> 36:09.100
YOU CHANGING YOUR LIFE.

36:09.133 --> 36:10.467
SO DO I.

36:10.500 --> 36:12.300
OKAY.

36:12.333 --> 36:15.067
HEY, GEORGE.

36:15.067 --> 36:16.333
***

36:16.367 --> 36:19.700
I DON'T KNOW MUCH,
BUT I DO KNOW FIGHTING.

36:19.733 --> 36:22.600
AND PEOPLE WHO FIGHT
LIKE YOU AND IZZIE,

36:22.633 --> 36:24.633
THOSE PEOPLE
LOVE EACH OTHER.

36:24.667 --> 36:26.333
SHE MISSES HER FRIEND.

36:26.367 --> 36:28.733
WHAT HE MEANT IS,

36:28.767 --> 36:30.600
NOTHING COMES
WITHOUT A PRICE.

36:30.633 --> 36:32.533
(Alex clicks his tongue)

36:32.567 --> 36:35.367
THE ROAD TO HELL
IS PAVED WITH GOOD INTENTIONS.
(pager beeps)

36:35.400 --> 36:37.300
SO BEFORE YOU GO INTO BATTLE,

36:37.333 --> 36:39.800
YOU BETTER DECIDE HOW MUCH
YOU'RE WILLING TO LOSE.

36:39.833 --> 36:42.333
DR. KAREV...

36:42.367 --> 36:46.067
YOU DID
SUCH A GOOD JOB TODAY THAT...

36:46.067 --> 36:47.800
I'M GONNA TALK TO DR. BAILEY

36:47.833 --> 36:49.633
AND HAVE YOU ASSIGNED
TO MY SERVICE.

36:49.667 --> 36:50.700
WHAT? FOR HOW LONG?

36:50.733 --> 36:52.533
FOR AS LONG AS I WANT.

36:52.567 --> 36:54.467
YOUR ASS IS MINE
UNTIL I SAY OTHERWISE.

36:54.500 --> 36:56.433
CONGRATULATIONS.

36:56.467 --> 36:59.300
***

36:59.333 --> 37:01.167
YOU GOT IT.

37:01.200 --> 37:03.800
I DID, INDEED.

37:03.833 --> 37:05.167
AND YOU'RE OKAY?

37:05.200 --> 37:07.667
ARE YOU KIDDING ME?
I'M GREAT.

37:07.700 --> 37:08.833
I MEAN, LOOK AT THIS--

37:08.867 --> 37:12.100
SOME NICE-SIZED BATTERIES,
COLORFUL WIRES.

37:12.133 --> 37:14.067
IT'S WHAT YOUR
BEST-DRESSED LVAD PATIENTS

37:14.100 --> 37:16.300
ARE WEARING THESE DAYS,
YOU KNOW?

37:16.333 --> 37:17.267
REALLY?

37:17.300 --> 37:20.367
'CAUSE IT SEEMS
SO LAST FALL.

37:20.400 --> 37:23.567
***

37:23.600 --> 37:27.433
(sighs)

37:28.700 --> 37:30.833
YOU'RE TALL.

37:30.867 --> 37:32.200
I KNOW.

37:32.233 --> 37:33.733
(giggles)

37:33.767 --> 37:36.733
***

37:36.767 --> 37:38.833
TOO OFTEN, GOING AFTER
WHAT FEELS GOOD

37:38.867 --> 37:43.733
MEANS LETTING GO
OF WHAT YOU KNOW IS RIGHT.

37:43.767 --> 37:46.733
***

37:51.367 --> 37:56.067
YOU DID EVERYTHING
YOU COULD.

37:56.100 --> 37:58.800
***

37:58.833 --> 38:02.600
THERE WAS AN INTERVIEW
THAT EUGENE GAVE.

38:02.633 --> 38:03.800
I SAVED IT.

38:03.833 --> 38:06.700
I TAPED IT
TO MY BATHROOM MIRROR.

38:06.733 --> 38:10.333
HE SAID THAT HE WASN'T
THE MOST TALENTED STUDENT

38:10.367 --> 38:11.533
AT MUSIC SCHOOL.

38:11.567 --> 38:14.800
BUT HE SAID WHAT HE LACKED
IN NATURAL ABILITY,

38:14.833 --> 38:19.067
HE MADE UP FOR IN DISCIPLINE.

38:19.100 --> 38:21.667
HE PRACTICED...

38:21.700 --> 38:25.067
ALL THE TIME.

38:25.100 --> 38:28.067
ALL THE TIME,
HE PRACTICED.

38:28.067 --> 38:30.600
I WASN'T LIKE YOU.

38:30.633 --> 38:33.500
I WASN'T THE MOST TALENTED
STUDENT IN SCHOOL.

38:33.533 --> 38:36.300
I WASN'T THE BRIGHTEST.

38:36.333 --> 38:40.100
BUT I WAS THE BEST.

38:40.133 --> 38:43.133
***

38:48.800 --> 38:51.467
YOU PRACTICED.

38:51.500 --> 38:54.600
I PRACTICED.

38:54.633 --> 38:58.333
AND LETTING SOMEONE IN
MEANS ABANDONING THE WALLS

38:58.367 --> 39:00.267
YOU'VE SPENT
A LIFETIME BUILDING.

39:00.300 --> 39:02.800
I GOT HOME, HE WAS LISTLESS
AND HADN'T EATEN ALL DAY.

39:02.833 --> 39:04.733
OH, NO. LET'S HAVE A LOOK.

39:04.767 --> 39:09.067
***

39:09.067 --> 39:10.800
OF COURSE,
THE TOUGHEST SACRIFICES

39:10.833 --> 39:12.633
ARE THE ONES
WE DON'T SEE COMING...

39:12.667 --> 39:14.600
HEY.

39:14.633 --> 39:16.567
HEY.

39:16.600 --> 39:18.567
***

39:18.600 --> 39:20.267
IS HE SICK AGAIN?

39:20.300 --> 39:21.567
YEAH.

39:21.600 --> 39:25.167
***

39:27.433 --> 39:29.100
GEORGE.

39:29.133 --> 39:30.067
HEY.

39:30.100 --> 39:31.067
HEY.

39:31.067 --> 39:32.100
OH.

39:32.133 --> 39:33.733
OH, HI.

39:33.767 --> 39:35.400
HEY.

39:35.433 --> 39:37.700
SO WE SPENT THE NIGHT
AT CALLIE'S LAST NIGHT.

39:37.733 --> 39:40.500
SO I FIGURED WE'D JUST
SPEND THE NIGHT HERE.

39:40.533 --> 39:42.500
OKAY, SO, UH...

39:42.533 --> 39:44.433
YOU'RE BACK, THEN,
JUST FOR TONIGHT?

39:44.467 --> 39:46.300
WELL, CALLIE'S HERE
FOR TONIGHT.

39:46.333 --> 39:47.833
I'M, UH...

39:47.867 --> 39:49.833
I DON'T KNOW.

39:49.867 --> 39:52.733
IT'S MY ROOM.
I PAY RENT.

39:52.767 --> 39:55.267
WELCOME HOME.

39:55.300 --> 39:58.767
WHEN WE DON'T HAVE TIME
TO COME UP WITH A STRATEGY,

39:58.800 --> 40:00.100
TO PICK A SIDE

40:00.133 --> 40:03.667
OR TO MEASURE
THE POTENTIAL LOSS.

40:03.700 --> 40:07.533
***

40:07.567 --> 40:10.367
YOU WOULD NOT BELIEVE
THE DAY I HAD.

40:10.400 --> 40:12.200
I WENT OUT OF MY WAY
TO GIVE A PATIENT

40:12.233 --> 40:13.367
EXACTLY WHAT SHE WANTS,

40:13.400 --> 40:15.733
ONLY TO HAVE IT
EXPLODE IN MY FACE.

40:15.767 --> 40:18.133
I MEAN, LAWSUIT, THREATS,
RICHARD'S PISSED.

40:18.167 --> 40:20.600
DON'T EVEN GET ME STARTED
ABOUT ALEX KAREV.
GET IN THE SHOWER.

40:20.633 --> 40:21.567
WHAT?

40:21.600 --> 40:23.600
GET IN THE SHOWER
WITH ME.

40:23.633 --> 40:27.033
HONEY,
IT'S A VERY SMALL SHOWER.

40:27.067 --> 40:30.400
YOU WANT TO HAVE HOT SEX?

40:30.433 --> 40:33.133
THANK YOU. OH.

40:33.167 --> 40:35.300
WHEN THAT HAPPENS,
WHEN THE BATTLE CHOOSES US

40:35.333 --> 40:37.233
AND NOT THE OTHER WAY AROUND,

40:37.267 --> 40:38.833
THAT'S WHEN THE SACRIFICE

40:38.867 --> 40:43.233
CAN TURN OUT TO BE
MORE THAN WE CAN BEAR.

40:43.267 --> 40:46.267
