Nice to see you.

22:28.213 --> 22:31.444
<i>Sir, this is my writing
partner, Mr. Yardley Acheman.</i>

22:31.516 --> 22:33.347
(CLOCK TICKING LOUDLY)

22:37.656 --> 22:40.181
Of course.

22:40.258 --> 22:42.226
<i>I suppose
the best place to start</i>

22:42.294 --> 22:43.989
would be the beginning.

22:44.062 --> 22:45.689
<i>I was born in this county.</i>

22:45.764 --> 22:50.201
<i>1897, to poor
but proud parents.</i>

22:50.268 --> 22:52.930
YARDLEY: <i>Mr. Pine,
could we skip 65 years,</i>

22:53.004 --> 22:54.733
save everyone some time?

22:57.309 --> 22:59.675
Hillary Van Wetter, 1965?

22:59.745 --> 23:02.305
Oh, I can't agree to talk
to you about that matter.

23:02.381 --> 23:04.474
<i>Not without
my client's permission.</i>

23:04.549 --> 23:08.315
He's entitled to his privacy,
just like anybody else.

23:08.387 --> 23:11.151
<i>You have his permission.
He wrote you.</i>

23:11.223 --> 23:13.384
I'll have to check that out.

23:13.458 --> 23:15.858
<i>I'm sure the letters would
be in your files, Mr. Pine.</i>

23:15.927 --> 23:18.054
<i>That's what you say, but I
have a client to protect.</i>

23:19.865 --> 23:22.459
Look here.

23:22.534 --> 23:24.866
If we have to get a lawyer
of our own down here

23:24.936 --> 23:27.200
to sort this out,
then while he's here,

23:27.272 --> 23:31.936
we're gonna have him look through every
aspect of Mr. Van Wetter's case.

23:32.010 --> 23:34.570
<i>Including the competency
of his defense.</i>

23:34.646 --> 23:37.615
<i>There was nothing wrong with the defense
Hillary Van Wetter got in court!</i>

23:37.682 --> 23:40.173
Then you have nothing
to worry about from us.

23:40.252 --> 23:41.549
We just want to talk to him.

23:41.620 --> 23:43.212
Then we'll be out of your...

23:43.288 --> 23:45.017
You don't know a thing
about this person!

23:45.090 --> 23:49.618
You've been in this world
for five minutes, boy!

23:49.694 --> 23:52.891
WARD: <i>Now that's just
not necessary, Mr. Pine.</i>

23:52.964 --> 23:55.194
Yes. <i>I talk the way I
want in my office!</i>

23:55.267 --> 23:57.428
All right. Then you'll arrange
the meeting, will you?

24:03.475 --> 24:04.806
Quick!
We're gonna be late!

24:07.479 --> 24:09.572
You get the marriage license?

24:31.770 --> 24:33.328
(LAUGHTER)

24:33.405 --> 24:35.202
<i>I can't believe
we're doing this!</i>

24:38.410 --> 24:39.968
(KISSING SOUND)

24:40.045 --> 24:42.172
Fuck! Jack, go knock
on the door again.

24:44.182 --> 24:46.707
WARD: <i>There she is. Whoa, baby</i>

24:49.020 --> 24:51.386
Well, I say...
WARD: Good morning, Miss Bless.

24:51.456 --> 24:53.583
Look at Daisy Mae.

24:53.658 --> 24:55.023
CHARLOTTE: <i>Morning.</i>

24:55.093 --> 24:56.185
WARD: You look just fine.

24:56.261 --> 24:57.660
Hope he likes it.

24:57.696 --> 24:59.493
(SIGH)

25:02.634 --> 25:04.693
Uh...

25:04.769 --> 25:06.760
Would you mind putting
up the windows?

25:06.838 --> 25:08.169
It's gonna muss my hair.

25:10.609 --> 25:13.635
Are you serious?

25:13.712 --> 25:15.873
<i>I'm sweating like a
pregnant nun back here.</i>

25:15.947 --> 25:17.881

25:17.949 --> 25:19.473
<i>Unbelievable!</i>

25:19.784 --> 25:21.752

25:36.167 --> 25:37.225
Hi.

25:53.718 --> 25:55.276
OFFICER: <i>You got 15 minutes.</i>

25:55.353 --> 25:56.843
<i>No physical contact
of any kind.</i>

25:56.922 --> 25:58.753
<i>No tape recorders.</i>

25:58.823 --> 26:00.484
<i>No object may be passed
to the prisoner.</i>

26:00.559 --> 26:01.856
<i>I'll be right
outside this door.</i>

26:01.927 --> 26:05.693
(ANGRY VOICE DISTANT)

26:05.764 --> 26:07.391

26:10.268 --> 26:12.429
WARD:
<i>Mr. Van Wetter,</i>

26:12.504 --> 26:14.699
my name is Ward Jansen.

26:14.773 --> 26:19.403
This is my associate, Yardley
Acheman... You look like your picture.

26:19.477 --> 26:24.380
CHARLOTTE: (WHISPERS SEXY) Mmm.
I do?

26:24.449 --> 26:26.417
Thank you.

26:26.451 --> 26:27.179
(GIGGLES)

26:28.420 --> 26:30.388
These your paperboys?

26:33.224 --> 26:34.521
Mm-hm.

26:34.593 --> 26:36.322
What they gonna do for us?

26:37.796 --> 26:40.629
They gonna save you.

26:40.699 --> 26:42.758
They're gonna save us?

26:45.570 --> 26:46.434
Mm-hm.

26:51.743 --> 26:53.938
Shit. They can't even
save themselves.

26:54.012 --> 26:55.673
Mr. Van Wetter,
we wanted to ask you

26:55.747 --> 26:57.237
about the lost evidence
in your case.

26:57.315 --> 26:59.476
Shut up. Can't you see I'm busy?

27:03.989 --> 27:07.049
HILLARY: (WHISPERING) <i>Will you
do something for me right now?</i>

27:07.125 --> 27:11.391
Oh.
Oh, I wish I could.

27:16.935 --> 27:19.335
Spread your legs open
a little bit.

27:21.606 --> 27:25.440
<i>Mmm.
Yeah.</i>

27:25.510 --> 27:27.444
<i>Now tear off them pantyhose.</i>

27:27.512 --> 27:29.241
<i>Rip those off.</i>

27:32.083 --> 27:34.347
<i>Yeah.
Mm-hm.</i>

27:34.419 --> 27:36.319
<i>Move your hands away.
Mmm.</i>

27:36.354 --> 27:39.187
<i>Yeah.</i>
(PANTING)

27:46.264 --> 27:48.255
Now open up your mouth...

27:48.333 --> 27:50.358
<i>you picture what you wrote
me in your letters.</i>

27:50.435 --> 27:52.630

You're a good girl.
<i>I warned y'all! This visit's over!</i>

29:15.453 --> 29:16.973
<i>I told y'all this
visit was... come on!</i>

29:17.021 --> 29:18.386
<i>Come on, Hillary.</i>
No!

29:18.456 --> 29:20.651
No!
There's nothing going on!

29:20.725 --> 29:22.386
Shit! No! (LAUGHING)

29:22.460 --> 29:25.952
What the fuck? I didn't
touch that girl!

29:26.030 --> 29:27.827
No!
No!

you laughing about?

ANITA: (OFF) <i>Jack came home
and threw up after that.</i>

29:38.409 --> 29:40.138
<i>He couldn't believe
he still loved her</i>

29:40.211 --> 29:42.771
<i>after what he saw, but he did.</i>

29:42.847 --> 29:46.078
CLERK: You're Ward Ward's boy?
WARD: Mm-hm.

29:46.151 --> 29:49.211
Most contrary man
in all of Moat County.

29:52.423 --> 29:54.482
What may I do for you
gentlemen today?

29:54.559 --> 29:57.221
It's about the murder
of Sheriff Call.

29:57.295 --> 29:59.354
I understand that there's
some physical evidence

29:59.430 --> 30:01.557
relating to the case
that was lost?

30:01.633 --> 30:04.033
Yes, sir.
I believe there was.

30:04.102 --> 30:06.502
Well, we was wondering
what sort of explanation

30:06.571 --> 30:09.165
the department might have.

30:09.240 --> 30:10.434
I wish I knew.

30:12.777 --> 30:16.144
Mr. Van Wetter once cut
a deputy's thumb off.

30:18.049 --> 30:19.846
Did you know that?

30:19.918 --> 30:23.012
<i>It was over a traffic ticket,
if I remember.</i>

30:23.087 --> 30:25.851
<i>You can't do much
without your thumb.</i>

30:25.924 --> 30:29.792
It's what separates us
from the primates.

30:29.861 --> 30:33.957
For a little thing like
holding your wife's titty.

30:34.032 --> 30:37.195
You're not married, Mr. Jansen?
No.

30:40.839 --> 30:42.932
A little thing like that,
you can't do it.

30:45.376 --> 30:46.968
Maybe I'll just go talk
to the deputies

30:47.045 --> 30:48.876
who was involved in the arrest.

30:48.947 --> 30:50.710
<i>You can talk
to whoever you want</i>

30:50.782 --> 30:53.148
as long as they'll talk to you.
But they won't.

30:53.218 --> 30:55.448
<i>And why is that?</i>

30:55.520 --> 30:57.852
They haven't forgotten what
Hillary did to one of theirs.

30:57.922 --> 30:59.480
<i>The judge allowed testimony</i>

30:59.557 --> 31:01.184
based on evidence
that he never even saw.

31:01.259 --> 31:03.159
He took the officer's word
over Hillary's.

31:03.228 --> 31:06.459
I can't say I blame him.
Nobody does.

31:08.233 --> 31:10.098
(TINGING)

31:10.168 --> 31:15.231
(BOXING SOUNDS)

me in the face there.

31:25.884 --> 31:27.545
YARDLEY: <i>So you've
got to ask him.</i>

31:27.585 --> 31:29.678
<i>Where was he
between 2:00 and 6:00?</i>

31:29.754 --> 31:31.085
WARD: <i>I'm gonna ask him
about some things he wrote,</i>

(WARD CLEARS HIS THROAT)

31:52.076 --> 31:55.068
Where's your dress?

31:55.146 --> 31:57.239
You don't like me like this?

31:57.315 --> 31:59.875
<i>You know a prisoner
by the name of...</i>

31:59.951 --> 32:01.441
<i>Ward, Ward, Ward.</i>

32:01.519 --> 32:03.111
<i>You know a prisoner by the name</i>

32:03.187 --> 32:05.621
<i>of Mr. Bobby Valentine?</i>
Mr. Van Wetter?

32:05.690 --> 32:08.284
Mr. Demarcus Williams,
Mr. Bobby Hinton?

32:08.359 --> 32:10.759
<i>Another prisoner
by the name of Jimmy Edwards,</i>

32:10.828 --> 32:12.989
<i>another one, Demarcus.</i>

32:13.064 --> 32:15.123
<i>I think his name is Curt.
I forgot his last name.</i>

32:15.199 --> 32:17.360
<i>Anyway, you know what
they all have in common?</i>

32:17.435 --> 32:20.063
<i>Hey, Martin Luther King.</i>

32:20.138 --> 32:22.106
<i>You know what they all had in common?</i>
WARD: <i>What?</i>

32:22.173 --> 32:24.698
<i>They all wear pants.</i>

32:24.776 --> 32:26.903
Every goddamned man
in here wears pants!

32:26.978 --> 32:28.946
How am I supposed to tell
you apart from them?

32:28.980 --> 32:30.709
Don't talk to her like that!
Sit down, Jack.

32:30.782 --> 32:32.647
OFFICER: <i>Sit the fuck down.</i>

32:32.717 --> 32:34.912
Mr. Van Wetter, we don't have
a lot of time, all right?

32:34.986 --> 32:36.749
We got to move on.

32:36.821 --> 32:39.312
You're gonna move
on one way or another, Ward?

32:39.390 --> 32:41.551
<i>Ward's in charge!</i>

32:41.626 --> 32:45.221
He's gonna get his way...
till he don't.

32:45.296 --> 32:48.094
<i>Maybe that's how he got
his scars on the face.</i>

32:51.102 --> 32:54.071
You mentioned in one of
your letters to Miss Bless

32:54.138 --> 32:56.629
<i>that you was working
Turn around, bitch!</i>

32:56.708 --> 32:58.938

<i>Yeah, yeah,</i>

32:59.010 --> 33:00.602

What kind of work you doing?
Lawn work.

33:01.746 --> 33:03.373
<i>Lawn work.</i>

Bitch, look at me!</i>

33:12.256 --> 33:13.814
And stop bringing
that fucking nigger

<i>Why don't you have a seat?</i>

33:22.567 --> 33:23.534
<i>Go home, boy!</i>

33:27.372 --> 33:29.340
I don't know...

33:29.407 --> 33:33.434
Charlotte, where does one get
pants like that from anyway?

33:33.511 --> 33:36.480
Well, I think we got
the case licked.

WARD: (OFF)<i> In this town,</i>

of Ward and Yardley, too.</i>

<i>Ward wasn't somebody who attached
himself to just anybody.</i>

girlfriend, what's her name?

was so attached to that Yardley.</i>

in Florida. How about you?</i>

34:23.161 --> 34:25.755
<i>It doesn't bother me. I
never pay attention to it.</i>

Cold and wet just goes fucking
through you like a knife

34:29.634 --> 34:32.626

34:32.703 --> 34:36.900
So how's Mr. Van Wetter today?
He still innocent?

34:36.974 --> 34:39.442
<i>I don't know.
If he is...</i>

34:39.510 --> 34:42.706
he sure as hell didn't
have no help proving it,

34:42.780 --> 34:44.645
not from that
Weldon Pine guy anyway.

34:44.715 --> 34:47.275
Could I have a fork
or something?

34:47.351 --> 34:50.286
The chicken legs, you eat
those with your hands.

34:50.353 --> 34:52.083
Maybe at your house.

34:54.125 --> 34:56.525

how I feel about that.</i>

Do you eat your mashed potatoes with your hands?
