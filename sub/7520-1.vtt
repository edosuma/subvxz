03:48.770 --> 03:50.439
Good morning, baby girl.

03:53.984 --> 03:55.944
Now, baby, I got to go to work.

03:55.986 --> 03:59.698
So, I thought that this salt bath...

03:59.781 --> 04:01.617
would help with your soreness.

04:30.270 --> 04:31.480
I love you.

04:37.152 --> 04:38.654
Enjoy your bath.

04:48.121 --> 04:49.581
I know, mom.

04:51.542 --> 04:52.960
Yeah.

04:56.547 --> 04:58.757
Soon.

05:02.177 --> 05:03.554
OK.

05:03.595 --> 05:06.139
OK, bye.

05:06.223 --> 05:08.267
- Hey! Hi.
- Hey, guys.

05:08.350 --> 05:09.518
Let's go.

05:09.560 --> 05:10.978
Where are we going?

05:11.061 --> 05:12.187
It's a surprise.

05:12.271 --> 05:13.313
I'm afraid.

05:13.397 --> 05:15.357
Oh, wait, I have to get my purse.

05:15.399 --> 05:17.025
We got you covered. Come on, girl.

05:17.109 --> 05:19.069
No, I can't leave without my phone.

05:28.954 --> 05:30.789
I am so glad you came.

05:30.873 --> 05:33.542
What do you mean? You guys kidnapped me.

05:33.584 --> 05:34.668
Well, you deserve it...

05:34.751 --> 05:35.669
and so do I.

05:35.752 --> 05:37.588
All that running around with my 2 kids.

05:37.671 --> 05:40.048
How are my niece and my nephew anyway?

05:40.090 --> 05:41.884
They are wonderful...

05:41.925 --> 05:44.428
but you know we had
to move in with Madea.

05:44.511 --> 05:45.929
Neither one of these baby daddies...

05:45.971 --> 05:46.930
is paying child support.

05:47.014 --> 05:48.557
Triflin'. You know.

05:48.599 --> 05:51.101
It's OK. I'm doing what I gotta do.

05:51.143 --> 05:52.519
That's a black woman's motto.

05:52.603 --> 05:54.897
We don't always do what we want to do...

05:54.938 --> 05:57.232
but we always do what we have to do.

05:57.274 --> 05:59.276
You should've let me bring my purse.

05:59.318 --> 06:01.069
You guys can't afford all this.

06:01.153 --> 06:04.031
Lisa, we wanted to do
something special for you.

06:04.114 --> 06:05.991
Will you relax? We got it.

06:06.074 --> 06:07.701
Hi.

06:10.370 --> 06:11.413
Hey.

06:11.496 --> 06:13.749
I'm Frankie Henderson.

06:13.832 --> 06:15.626
You ride my bus all the time.

06:15.709 --> 06:16.793
The number 9.

06:16.877 --> 06:18.420
Right.

06:18.462 --> 06:19.755
Is this your gym?

06:19.796 --> 06:22.591
No, I just dropped off a painting.

06:22.674 --> 06:26.178
Well, it was good to see you again.

06:28.180 --> 06:30.390
Look, I was just wondering...

06:30.474 --> 06:33.268
would you like to go
out with me sometime?

06:35.354 --> 06:36.605
I wrote my number down...

06:36.688 --> 06:38.607
and I know this place maybe...

06:38.649 --> 06:40.776
You are bold.

06:40.859 --> 06:43.320
You're gonna ask her
out right in front of us?

06:43.403 --> 06:45.447
You know we're gonna
talk about you, right?

06:45.531 --> 06:48.158
Yeah, well...

06:48.242 --> 06:49.785
now that I'm officially embarrassed...

06:49.868 --> 06:52.621
Excuse me. I'm her sister.

06:52.704 --> 06:54.957
She'll be calling you.

06:58.168 --> 06:59.253
Good.

06:59.336 --> 07:01.463
All right, bye.

07:04.341 --> 07:05.467
Bye.

07:05.509 --> 07:06.802
Lisa!

07:06.885 --> 07:09.471
Looks like somebody's
got a secret admirer.

07:09.513 --> 07:11.974
Oh, please. You are taking this number.

07:12.015 --> 07:14.518
No, you didn't!

07:14.601 --> 07:15.727
Yes, I did.

07:15.811 --> 07:16.854
What did he say?

07:16.937 --> 07:19.648
What could he say? He had to come clean.

07:19.731 --> 07:21.859
He was married.

07:21.942 --> 07:23.861
I am so sick of dating.

07:23.902 --> 07:26.071
And ya'll want me to go on a date.

07:26.154 --> 07:27.865
'Cause you need to.

07:27.948 --> 07:30.075
You haven't been out in two years.

07:30.158 --> 07:31.410
Don't worry about me.

07:31.493 --> 07:32.828
Let's talk about you.

07:32.870 --> 07:34.496
In less than ninety days...

07:34.580 --> 07:36.081
you're gonna be marrying...

07:36.165 --> 07:37.749
one of the most eligible
bachelors in Atlanta.

07:37.833 --> 07:39.001
And he's rich?

07:39.042 --> 07:40.627
What did you say he do again?

07:40.711 --> 07:41.962
He's an investment banker.

07:42.045 --> 07:44.214
Yeah, my mom introduced
me to him last year.

07:44.298 --> 07:46.508
I don't even know what an
investment banker does...

07:46.550 --> 07:49.928
but he must be doing it very well.

07:50.012 --> 07:51.847
Living here on the 30th floor.

07:51.930 --> 07:54.183
I gotta check my phone.

07:54.224 --> 07:55.809
Just a second.

07:58.979 --> 08:00.022
Who can that be?

08:00.063 --> 08:02.316
I don't know. You better get it.

08:03.609 --> 08:05.068
Oh.

08:05.110 --> 08:06.862
Are you Miss Lisa Breaux?

08:06.904 --> 08:07.946
Yes, I am.

08:08.030 --> 08:09.031
May I come in?

08:09.114 --> 08:11.074
Yeah, sure.

08:18.415 --> 08:20.375
What's going on?

08:20.417 --> 08:21.710
You...

08:21.752 --> 08:24.087
are under arrest.

08:24.171 --> 08:25.380
Oh...

08:26.840 --> 08:29.468
No, no, no. Stop, stop, stop.

08:29.551 --> 08:31.136
No, no. Just stop.

08:31.220 --> 08:32.346
- Just enjoy it.
- Really!

08:32.429 --> 08:35.349
No, really, you have to go.

08:35.432 --> 08:37.808
No, no, no, no, no, you have to...

08:38.977 --> 08:40.604
- Girl...
- Please stop that!

08:40.687 --> 08:43.273
I should've cashed my check.

08:45.567 --> 08:48.237
You have to stop this right now.

08:50.030 --> 08:51.949
OK, OK. Just stop!

08:55.035 --> 08:56.245
Hi, honey.

09:13.762 --> 09:16.306
Hi. I am so sorry. This was...

09:16.390 --> 09:18.100
this was our idea.

09:18.183 --> 09:19.434
It was all your idea.

09:19.518 --> 09:21.186
Oh, don't be silly.

09:21.270 --> 09:23.438
- Don't be silly.
- I'm Vanessa.

09:23.480 --> 09:26.066
I'm Lisa's sister. It's
really good to meet you.

09:26.149 --> 09:27.359
- This is your sister?
- Yeah.

09:27.442 --> 09:29.152
Come here. So you're
family, family, family.

09:29.236 --> 09:31.196
Come here.

09:31.280 --> 09:33.073
Well, hey, hey. You guys carry on.

09:33.156 --> 09:34.157
Do your thing, brother.

09:34.241 --> 09:35.450
All right.

09:35.492 --> 09:37.911
Have a good time.

09:37.995 --> 09:39.663
OK. Put the music back on.

09:39.746 --> 09:42.416
No, no, no. You guys have to go.

09:42.499 --> 09:43.959
Why? He said it was OK.

09:44.001 --> 09:46.003
Donna, look what she got back there.

09:46.044 --> 09:48.422
She don't need this. Come on!

09:48.505 --> 09:50.299
Whatever.

09:50.340 --> 09:52.426
I paid you for a full dance...

09:52.509 --> 09:54.928
so we gonna finish at my house.

09:59.349 --> 10:01.310
It was really good
spending time with you.

10:01.351 --> 10:02.477
Thank you.

10:02.519 --> 10:04.354
Love you. Love you too.

10:06.690 --> 10:09.193
OK, bye. See you guys! Bye!

10:09.276 --> 10:10.736
- Call us!
- I will! OK.

10:23.290 --> 10:25.209
What you doing bringing him in my house?

10:25.292 --> 10:26.543
And I've been calling you.

10:26.627 --> 10:27.961
I've been calling you all day.

10:28.045 --> 10:30.047
I left my phone here.

10:30.130 --> 10:33.217
You love making me angry, don't you?

10:33.300 --> 10:35.594
I think you do this on purpose.

10:35.677 --> 10:37.971
You see how nice your life could be...

10:38.055 --> 10:40.349
if you just do what I say?

10:43.602 --> 10:44.603
Fix your hair.

11:22.975 --> 11:24.268
Mrs. Breaux.

11:24.351 --> 11:25.769
Victor.

11:25.811 --> 11:26.895
You look fantastic.

11:26.937 --> 11:28.188
Thank you.

11:29.356 --> 11:30.941
Hello. Hi.

11:31.024 --> 11:32.693
- You look wonderful.
- Thanks.

11:36.613 --> 11:38.448
Sweetie, my darling.

11:40.659 --> 11:42.202
Thank you.

11:43.620 --> 11:45.789
Well, I just came...

11:45.873 --> 11:47.791
from my mother-of-
the-bride dress fitting...

11:47.875 --> 11:52.045
and the gown is gorgeous!

11:52.129 --> 11:54.047
That B. Michael is a genius.

11:55.632 --> 11:57.551
Sit up straight, dear.

11:58.886 --> 12:00.345
What is wrong with you?

12:00.429 --> 12:03.265
You're so mopey when
you should be so excited.

12:03.307 --> 12:05.225
Well, I'm not, Mom.

12:05.309 --> 12:08.729
I know. You just have
cold feet, that's all.

12:08.812 --> 12:09.938
That's normal.

12:10.022 --> 12:11.773
He hits me.

12:14.401 --> 12:15.903
When?

12:17.404 --> 12:18.989
Often.

12:23.827 --> 12:25.787
Well, you must stop
doing what you're doing...

12:25.829 --> 12:27.831
to make him angry.

12:27.873 --> 12:29.124
What?

12:31.585 --> 12:34.213
Women sometimes have
to deal with things...

12:34.296 --> 12:35.797
to be comfortable.

12:38.550 --> 12:40.511
Mom, listen...

12:40.552 --> 12:42.554
You listen.

12:42.638 --> 12:44.640
Now it's time for you to grow up.

12:44.681 --> 12:47.267
Of course you're gonna marry him.

12:47.351 --> 12:48.936
What else are you gonna do...

12:49.019 --> 12:50.979
work in a bridal shop like your sister?

12:51.063 --> 12:53.315
Now, just be a good wife.

12:53.357 --> 12:55.859
Do what the man says...

12:55.901 --> 12:58.362
and you won't have any problems.

12:58.403 --> 13:00.030
Waiter!

13:01.615 --> 13:02.699
Yes, ma'am?

13:02.783 --> 13:05.494
I will have the salad
with bleu cheese...

13:05.577 --> 13:07.037
and no bacon, please.

13:07.120 --> 13:08.330
What would you like, darling?

13:10.874 --> 13:12.334
Now, why were you stealing?

13:12.376 --> 13:14.503
'Cause I was hungry.

13:14.586 --> 13:16.213
What happened to your
other foster parents?

13:16.296 --> 13:17.381
They don't care.

13:17.464 --> 13:19.883
They didn't even know that I was gone.

13:19.925 --> 13:21.718
Have a seat until I can get...

13:21.802 --> 13:23.220
a representative here
from child welfare.

13:23.303 --> 13:24.513
Call the next case.

13:24.555 --> 13:26.807
City of Atlanta versus Mabel Simmons.

13:32.729 --> 13:33.856
Madea!

13:33.897 --> 13:36.608
What are you up to now?

13:36.692 --> 13:38.777
She took off her house arrest bracelet.

13:38.861 --> 13:41.238
You better have a good
reason for taking it off...

13:41.321 --> 13:44.700
because I have a good mind
to send you to jail right now.

13:44.741 --> 13:45.826
Actually, she does.

13:45.909 --> 13:47.661
She takes care of my elderly father...

13:47.744 --> 13:50.164
and, he was sick, and
she needed to get...

13:50.247 --> 13:51.665
Oh, I don't believe that crap.

13:51.748 --> 13:53.167
You don't know how to lie.

13:53.250 --> 13:55.544
What kind of lawyer
don't know how to lie?

13:55.586 --> 13:56.879
Lie and lawyer go together.

13:56.920 --> 13:58.505
Lie-awyer,
lie-awyer.

13:58.589 --> 14:00.507
Do you take care of his father?

14:00.591 --> 14:01.842
Yes, I have to though...

14:01.925 --> 14:04.052
'cause ain't nobody else
gonna take care of him.

14:04.094 --> 14:06.096
That's my only brother,
and I take care...

14:06.138 --> 14:07.514
of his kids when he has court...

14:07.598 --> 14:08.724
and I take care of my great-niece...

14:08.765 --> 14:10.267
and her children.

14:10.350 --> 14:11.602
They at my house too...

14:11.685 --> 14:13.896
'cause I open my house
up to anybody in need.

14:13.979 --> 14:15.522
They can come to my house...

14:15.606 --> 14:16.607
get a good meal, everything.

14:16.690 --> 14:18.358
That's why I can't be tied down.

14:18.442 --> 14:20.903
I have to be going to
the store and stuff.

14:20.986 --> 14:22.946
I feed the homeless and help the hungry.

14:22.988 --> 14:25.407
I'm going out in the
highways and by-ways

14:25.449 --> 14:27.659
and doing what the lord told me to do.

14:27.743 --> 14:29.286
Praise him. Thank you, Jesus.

14:29.369 --> 14:30.704
Does she watch your kids?

14:30.787 --> 14:31.788
She's actually really good.

14:31.872 --> 14:33.081
She's a big disciplinarian though...

14:33.123 --> 14:35.417
but they have a lot of respect for her.

14:35.459 --> 14:36.543
Really?

14:38.128 --> 14:39.546
Stand up, Nikki.

14:42.508 --> 14:44.259
Mabel Simmons...

14:44.343 --> 14:46.970
since you can't seem to act
like you have any sense...

14:47.054 --> 14:48.472
except if you're caring for somebody...

14:48.514 --> 14:50.933
meet Nikki Grady.

14:50.974 --> 14:53.560
You're her new foster mother.

14:53.644 --> 14:54.978
The hell I am.

14:55.062 --> 14:56.438
Hell, no!

14:56.480 --> 14:59.024
It's a reason why God put
a woman through menopause.

14:59.107 --> 15:01.401
I'm past 60, honey.
You know what that mean?

15:01.485 --> 15:02.694
Madea, calm down.

15:02.778 --> 15:04.196
Ain't supposed to be
bothered with no bad kids.

15:04.279 --> 15:05.322
I will kill that little girl.

15:05.405 --> 15:06.823
I don't know her.

15:06.907 --> 15:08.742
She might be one of them
Sandinistas or something.

15:08.825 --> 15:09.743
She might be...

15:09.826 --> 15:12.412
So? You ugly anyway, old lady.

15:12.496 --> 15:14.790
She trying to get me the
electric chair already.

15:14.832 --> 15:16.875
Either you're her foster mother...

15:16.959 --> 15:18.752
or you're a prison mother.

15:18.836 --> 15:21.380
I'll take the prison for 200, Alex.

15:21.463 --> 15:22.965
Lock me up. I'd rather be...

15:23.048 --> 15:24.132
in Martha Stewart's old cell...

15:24.216 --> 15:25.300
fighting for my virginity...

15:25.384 --> 15:27.553
than to be sitting
there dealing with this.

15:27.636 --> 15:31.056
She'll be a great foster
mother, your honor.

15:34.184 --> 15:36.937
This a Benz. What
kind of drugs you sell?

15:40.357 --> 15:42.317
I don't sell drugs.

15:42.359 --> 15:43.819
I'm a lawyer.

15:44.945 --> 15:47.239
You get the drug dealers off.

15:47.322 --> 15:49.908
That ain't no way to
talk to no grown person...

15:49.992 --> 15:50.993
and stop poppin' that gum.

15:51.076 --> 15:52.536
Don't tell me what to do.

15:54.329 --> 15:55.831
Madea.

15:55.873 --> 15:57.166
You better get her.

15:57.207 --> 15:58.792
She don't know who she's talking to.

15:58.876 --> 16:00.502
You better ask somebody, honey.

16:00.544 --> 16:03.964
You know, the kids are doing well.

16:04.047 --> 16:06.258
Yeah, and Deborah... how's she doing?

16:06.341 --> 16:09.678
She's doing good, 15 months clean.

16:09.720 --> 16:12.389
Good. I thought I was gonna
have to hide my purse...

16:12.472 --> 16:14.683
at the family reunion,
'cause she used to steal.

16:14.725 --> 16:16.393
No, you won't have to do that.

16:16.476 --> 16:19.354
So, where's it gonna be this year?

16:19.396 --> 16:20.689
Gonna be at Aunt Ruby's.

16:20.731 --> 16:23.734
Little girl, I'm gonna
ask you one more time...

16:23.775 --> 16:26.195
to stop popping that gum.

16:26.236 --> 16:28.488
Whatever.

16:28.572 --> 16:32.784
You going to Lisa's wedding?

16:32.868 --> 16:35.996
Yeah, I'm going.

16:36.079 --> 16:38.165
I tell you, that Vanessa's
been wearing me out...

16:38.248 --> 16:39.541
asking me about I'm going.

16:39.583 --> 16:42.002
Little girl, if you don't
stop popping that gum...

16:42.085 --> 16:43.962
Look! If you touch me...

16:44.046 --> 16:45.881
I'm gonna call 911.

16:45.964 --> 16:48.258
My daughter tried that.
I hit her so hard...

16:48.342 --> 16:50.260
she dialed
9-9-10.

16:50.302 --> 16:52.679
You don't know me.
I'll whip an old woman.

16:52.763 --> 16:54.556
What? Who the hell you talking to?

16:54.598 --> 16:55.891
I'm talking to you.

16:57.851 --> 16:58.894
You think I'm playing?

17:04.441 --> 17:06.151
You ain't got no sense! Calm down!

17:06.234 --> 17:07.903
- Calm down!
- Shut up! Shut up!

17:07.944 --> 17:10.571
Now sit in that seat
and put the seat belt on.

17:10.656 --> 17:12.907
You better put that
seat belt on right now!

17:19.289 --> 17:21.625
What the hell is wrong
with these children today...

17:21.708 --> 17:22.917
but, I set 'em straight.

17:23.001 --> 17:25.127
I'm from the old school,
and I will beat...

17:25.212 --> 17:27.589
the hell out of you first
and ask questions later.

17:27.631 --> 17:29.967
If you don't know how to get in line...

17:30.050 --> 17:31.260
I will get you in line.

17:31.301 --> 17:33.303
Remind me to never leave
my kids with you again.

17:35.264 --> 17:37.099
Are you ready?

17:37.182 --> 17:39.726
Welcome to your wedding, darling.

17:39.810 --> 17:42.938
I thought since he
proposed to you in Paris...

17:42.980 --> 17:45.232
we'd give it a Parisian theme.

17:45.315 --> 17:47.192
The Eiffel tower...

17:47.276 --> 17:49.194
an orchestra...

17:49.278 --> 17:51.530
flowers flown in from Paris.

17:51.613 --> 17:52.698
The only wedding...

17:52.781 --> 17:55.450
Wow, you can do all this?

17:56.660 --> 17:59.079
Oh, yes, darling, I can get it done.

17:59.163 --> 18:01.373
I like that one.

18:01.456 --> 18:03.667
Well, this is Tomojio's design.

18:03.750 --> 18:05.502
He's my favorite, as well.

18:05.586 --> 18:08.797
Now, his bid is a little
on the expensive side...

18:08.839 --> 18:10.299
but he is worth it.

18:10.340 --> 18:12.467
We want him.

18:12.551 --> 18:15.220
Good.

18:16.847 --> 18:20.642
This will be the wedding
to rival all weddings.

18:22.019 --> 18:23.854
I'll get Tomojio on the line...

18:23.937 --> 18:26.315
and let him know you're
going with his design.

18:33.280 --> 18:36.241
Madea is having a family reunion...

18:36.325 --> 18:38.327
and we're going.

18:38.368 --> 18:40.329
I know. I heard.

18:40.370 --> 18:41.955
You know we don't fraternize, darling.

18:42.039 --> 18:43.790
Mom, this is our family...

18:43.874 --> 18:46.585
and it'll be good for
you to see your grandkids.

18:46.668 --> 18:49.129
I don't want to see
those little bastards.

18:49.213 --> 18:51.840
Mom! You will not talk
about my children that way.

18:51.882 --> 18:53.842
I swear, Vanessa...

18:53.884 --> 18:56.178
all the opportunities we afforded you...

18:56.261 --> 18:58.805
you have managed to throw
every one of them away.

18:58.889 --> 19:00.224
You're just like your father.

19:00.307 --> 19:01.558
Because Lisa's father had money...

19:01.642 --> 19:03.227
he was better than mine?

19:03.310 --> 19:04.645
Your father was a musician...

19:04.728 --> 19:06.063
who tried to ruin my life...

19:06.146 --> 19:07.481
is what I meant.

19:07.564 --> 19:09.066
Now, he threw his life away...

19:09.149 --> 19:10.442
and you are doing the same.

19:10.526 --> 19:12.277
You took the easy way out
and married that evil...

19:14.112 --> 19:16.156
All you wanted was his money.

19:16.240 --> 19:19.535
You will watch your mouth.

19:19.618 --> 19:21.161
That man did everything he could...

19:21.245 --> 19:22.371
for you and your sister...

19:22.454 --> 19:25.207
and it wasn't easy, asking
him to take you in...

19:25.249 --> 19:27.751
and you tried with all your might...

19:27.835 --> 19:29.294
to destroy my marriage.

19:29.378 --> 19:31.171
And now you will not talk about...

19:31.255 --> 19:32.422
my late husband in that manner.

19:32.506 --> 19:35.050
You are so wicked.

19:35.133 --> 19:36.426
You're gonna rot in hell.

19:36.510 --> 19:39.179
I vacation there.

19:45.978 --> 19:48.438
Who told you you know
how to fix a lawnmower?

19:48.522 --> 19:51.275
Uncle Joe, I know what
I'm doing, all right?

19:51.358 --> 19:52.568
I've fixed lawnmowers before.

19:52.651 --> 19:55.279
That ain't right. You
got to look here, boy.

19:55.362 --> 19:56.905
Get on out of the way.

19:56.989 --> 19:59.074
You got to work on the
auxiliary carburetor.

19:59.157 --> 20:01.743
This is the spark plug.

20:01.827 --> 20:02.828
You need the auxiliary...

20:02.911 --> 20:04.580
This is the auxiliary carburetor...

20:04.621 --> 20:06.290
and everything run through
the auxiliary carburetor...

20:06.373 --> 20:07.749
going on down to the engine.

20:07.833 --> 20:09.626
You see? All you need to do...

20:09.710 --> 20:11.420
is tap that to get it in line.

20:11.461 --> 20:12.588
See?

20:13.964 --> 20:15.632
I'm 'a tell Mabel you broke it.

20:15.716 --> 20:16.717
Wait now, Mr. Jones.

20:16.800 --> 20:18.677
I'm tell her you did it.

20:18.760 --> 20:22.222
Hey, Isaac broke your lawnmower.

20:22.306 --> 20:23.891
- I did not.
- Yeah, you did.

20:23.974 --> 20:25.100
You did. He broke it.

20:25.184 --> 20:27.144
How you doin', Isaac? Good to see you.

20:27.186 --> 20:29.146
How you doin', Madea?

20:29.229 --> 20:30.856
What's going on, man? How you doin'?

20:30.939 --> 20:32.399
Hey, Brian.

20:32.482 --> 20:34.151
- How are you?
- Good, good.

20:34.234 --> 20:37.112
I was sure hoping they
would lock you the hell up.

20:37.154 --> 20:39.448
Only thing locked up
'round here is your bowels.

20:39.531 --> 20:40.699
Now shut the hell up.

20:40.782 --> 20:42.701
How you doin', Daddy?

20:42.784 --> 20:44.036
Hey, Brian. Hey, uh, Tiffany...

20:44.119 --> 20:45.496
How you doin'?

20:45.579 --> 20:47.289
Daddy, this is not my daughter.

20:47.331 --> 20:48.624
They all look alike to me.

20:48.707 --> 20:49.791
Who it's for?

20:49.833 --> 20:51.251
Madea is her new foster mother.

20:51.335 --> 20:52.711
You're gonna have a house guest.

20:52.794 --> 20:55.130
That child ain't staying here.

20:55.214 --> 20:56.215
You can't stay here.

20:56.298 --> 20:57.883
Go back to where you came from.

20:57.966 --> 20:59.426
You can't stay in this house.

20:59.510 --> 21:01.011
Bad enough you let that gal...

21:01.094 --> 21:02.387
move in here with them two babies...

21:02.471 --> 21:03.514
making all that racket...

21:03.597 --> 21:05.182
all day long, now you brought her.

21:05.265 --> 21:06.600
Every time I send you somewhere...

21:06.683 --> 21:07.726
you come back with somethin'.

21:07.809 --> 21:08.894
Take it back. We don't want it.

21:08.977 --> 21:10.646
Return to sender.

21:10.687 --> 21:12.481
I remember I sent you somewhere too...

21:12.564 --> 21:13.815
and you came back with somethin'.

21:13.899 --> 21:14.858
You still itchin'?

21:14.942 --> 21:16.318
Yo' mama.

21:16.360 --> 21:18.362
Hell. That's my mama too, ain't it?

21:18.403 --> 21:20.280
Don't say that in front of this child.

21:20.364 --> 21:21.323
Come in the house.

21:21.406 --> 21:22.699
I'll show you where you're sleeping.

21:22.783 --> 21:24.785
Daddy, you gotta stop being so mean.

21:24.868 --> 21:27.120
I wish I had been mean to your mama.

21:27.204 --> 21:28.705
Then I wouldn't be sitting here...

21:28.789 --> 21:30.916
Iooking at you right now.

21:30.999 --> 21:33.710
That's crazy as hell, all
these people in this house.

21:33.794 --> 21:35.212
I'm gonna call the fire marshal.

21:35.295 --> 21:37.047
That is against the law!

21:37.130 --> 21:38.382
I'm gonna need some weed...

21:38.465 --> 21:40.551
to be dealing with all
these people in here.

21:40.634 --> 21:42.135
Babies crying every five minutes.

21:42.219 --> 21:43.554
Hell!

22:06.743 --> 22:08.412
How you doin'?

22:12.249 --> 22:14.626
Why, thanks, I'm fine.

22:25.262 --> 22:26.597
My heart's all better...

22:26.680 --> 22:29.808
from you shooting me down the other day.

22:29.892 --> 22:31.852
You still haven't called a brother.

22:34.605 --> 22:36.565
You still have my number?

22:38.483 --> 22:41.236
Yes? No?

22:41.278 --> 22:43.238
Maybe?

22:46.283 --> 22:48.660
What do you keep writing in that pad?

22:48.744 --> 22:51.288
Why?

22:51.371 --> 22:52.956
I'm just wondering.

22:53.040 --> 22:54.917
Poetry.

22:54.958 --> 22:56.043
Poetry, wow.

22:56.126 --> 22:57.544
You're a poet?

22:57.628 --> 22:59.922
Will you just drive
this bus, please, man?

23:08.597 --> 23:10.849
You know, I like poetry too.

23:10.933 --> 23:12.100
Check this out.

23:12.142 --> 23:14.228
Roses are red...

23:14.311 --> 23:16.772
violets are blue.

23:16.813 --> 23:18.774
If you go out with me...

23:18.815 --> 23:21.860
you will like me too.

23:24.363 --> 23:26.114
A smile!

23:26.156 --> 23:28.659
Ladies and gentlemen,
hallelujah, I see a smile.

23:28.700 --> 23:31.161
You are so...

23:34.665 --> 23:36.792
You should go out with me.

23:36.875 --> 23:39.962
I know this great spot... poets.

23:40.003 --> 23:42.589
Lady, please say yes so he can shut up.

23:42.673 --> 23:44.299
What do you say?

23:44.383 --> 23:45.843
I've had a really long day...

23:45.884 --> 23:48.512
my feet hurt, these
pantyhose are too tight...

23:48.595 --> 23:51.098
and I got two kids at
home waiting for me.

23:51.181 --> 23:52.641
Two?

23:52.724 --> 23:54.142
Yeah, two.

23:54.184 --> 23:57.604
I bet he don't want to
go out now. Two kids?

23:57.688 --> 24:00.440
Dude, she said "two
kids." Think about it.

24:00.524 --> 24:02.776
- You need to shut up.
- Don't start, Tyreka.

24:02.860 --> 24:04.862
I got a son.

24:04.945 --> 24:06.989
Maybe we could make
this a family thing...

24:07.072 --> 24:08.365
if you say yes.

24:08.448 --> 24:11.368
Miss? Miss!

24:11.410 --> 24:13.537
He really is a nice guy.

24:13.620 --> 24:15.789
I take my son to the
park every Saturday.

24:15.873 --> 24:17.791
You should bring your kids.

24:17.875 --> 24:21.086
You call me, and I'll tell you where.

24:21.170 --> 24:22.838
What do you say?

24:46.570 --> 24:47.946
I'll think about it.

25:04.630 --> 25:05.797
Good morning.

25:05.881 --> 25:09.384
That baby's speaking to
you. Say good morning.

25:09.468 --> 25:11.470
And?

25:13.847 --> 25:16.350
Oh, I'm sorry. Natural reaction.

25:16.433 --> 25:19.853
I was getting ready to
jump over this table here.

25:19.937 --> 25:21.688
You ain't got time to eat that.

25:21.772 --> 25:23.023
Bus'll be here any minute.

25:23.106 --> 25:24.316
You should've been down earlier.

25:24.399 --> 25:25.901
Take it to school with you.

25:25.984 --> 25:27.736
I don't want to go to school.

25:27.778 --> 25:30.113
You ain't got no choice.

25:30.197 --> 25:33.075
Why you don't want to go?

25:33.116 --> 25:35.202
I don't want to ride the bus.

25:35.285 --> 25:37.079
Why?

25:37.162 --> 25:39.331
Little girl, you better answer me.

25:41.583 --> 25:43.585
Kids be mean to me.

25:43.669 --> 25:45.754
They say all kind of stuff about me.

25:45.838 --> 25:47.798
And what you say to them?

25:50.092 --> 25:52.052
Nothin'.

25:52.135 --> 25:53.679
Honey, folk gonna talk about you...

25:53.762 --> 25:55.430
'til the day you die.

25:55.514 --> 25:57.766
Ain't nothin' you can do.

25:57.850 --> 26:00.143
Let folks talk. People talk about me.

26:00.227 --> 26:02.688
Yeah. They used to call her "wide load."

26:02.771 --> 26:06.275
Wide load. Beep.

26:06.358 --> 26:08.068
That's what they used to say...

26:08.151 --> 26:10.654
when she be comin'.

26:10.737 --> 26:11.989
Honey, listen to me.

26:12.072 --> 26:13.824
It ain't what people call you...

26:13.907 --> 26:15.117
it's what you answer to.

26:15.200 --> 26:17.161
You hear me? You remember that.

26:18.328 --> 26:19.329
Come on.

26:19.371 --> 26:20.330
Where you goin'?

26:20.414 --> 26:22.291
To the bus. Come on.

26:22.332 --> 26:24.626
I'll be right back.
Ya'll sit there and eat.

26:25.711 --> 26:28.714
Only way to deal with a bully is...

26:28.797 --> 26:30.465
to confront them face to face.

26:30.507 --> 26:31.925
You understand?

26:32.009 --> 26:33.260
Hold on, bus driver.

26:33.343 --> 26:36.263
I need to talk to some of
these children on the bus.

26:36.346 --> 26:38.140
Come on, little girl.

26:40.225 --> 26:41.351
Get on the bus.

26:44.438 --> 26:45.564
Listen up!

26:47.858 --> 26:49.651
This here is a friend of mine...

26:49.735 --> 26:52.196
and she been tellin' me
that a few of ya'll...

26:52.237 --> 26:54.281
been saying some stuff about her.

26:54.364 --> 26:56.492
If I catch any one of
ya'll saying something...

26:56.575 --> 26:58.744
it's gonna be me and you, you hear me?

26:58.827 --> 27:00.871
Shut up, old lady!

27:13.884 --> 27:16.803
All my life I had to fight.

27:16.887 --> 27:18.222
I loves Harpo...

27:18.305 --> 27:21.183
but I'll kill him dead
'fore I let him beat me.

27:21.225 --> 27:23.435
Who's Harpo?

27:23.519 --> 27:24.853
Go on. Go to school.

27:24.937 --> 27:26.605
Go on, sit down.

27:26.688 --> 27:28.857
I'll be waiting for
you when you get off.

27:28.941 --> 27:31.401
Ain't nobody gonna mess with you.

27:31.443 --> 27:32.736
Nobody.

27:32.819 --> 27:34.655
I ain't.

27:34.738 --> 27:38.450
I'll be waiting for you at 3:00.

27:41.829 --> 27:44.039
Let me see if you can do that.

27:44.122 --> 27:47.084
Oh, not bad.

27:47.125 --> 27:49.253
Let me check.

27:49.336 --> 27:51.046
They're still open. Hey, what happened?

27:51.088 --> 27:52.214
Just do it!

27:52.256 --> 27:54.424
Chicken.

27:54.508 --> 27:56.009
- Hey.
- Hi, guys. Hi.

27:56.093 --> 27:57.886
What's going on? Hold on.

27:57.928 --> 27:59.638
This is Nima.

27:59.721 --> 28:01.473
- Hey, Nima.
- And this is Jonathan.

28:01.557 --> 28:03.725
Hi, Jonathan. This
is my son Tre. Say hi.

28:03.767 --> 28:06.770
- Hello, Tre.

28:06.812 --> 28:08.772
Yes, you can. Let me tie your shoes.

28:08.814 --> 28:11.066
Hold up. Just wait
right here, all right?

28:11.108 --> 28:13.277
Yeah, but you gotta
be careful though, OK?

28:13.360 --> 28:15.070
Go ahead. You can go with them.

28:15.112 --> 28:16.572
Watch your brother, OK, Nima? OK.

28:16.613 --> 28:17.906
- All right.
- All right.

28:32.379 --> 28:33.672
Your kids are beautiful.

28:35.424 --> 28:37.009
Thank you.

28:37.092 --> 28:39.511
So is your son.

28:39.595 --> 28:42.139
Yeah. He's funny.

28:42.222 --> 28:44.141
They are a blessing, aren't they?

28:44.183 --> 28:45.517
Yep.

28:45.601 --> 28:46.894
Definitely.

28:46.977 --> 28:49.104
So where's his mother?

28:51.982 --> 28:53.108
She's married.

28:53.150 --> 28:55.485
Doesn't have much time for him.

29:00.365 --> 29:02.618
What about their fathers?

29:02.659 --> 29:04.620
One's in jail...

29:04.661 --> 29:07.664
and Nima's dad, he was...

29:07.706 --> 29:09.750
is married.

29:09.833 --> 29:11.210
He won't even see her.

29:13.045 --> 29:16.965
Tell me about you. Your mother, father?

29:17.007 --> 29:18.675
Mother and father are both dead.

29:18.759 --> 29:20.802
I was an only child.

29:22.554 --> 29:25.516
Like my job. Love to paint.

29:27.100 --> 29:29.520
I'm a Christian.

29:31.355 --> 29:33.148
Try to do the right thing.

29:35.317 --> 29:36.693
OK.

29:36.777 --> 29:38.904
So, you seem to be this great guy...

29:38.987 --> 29:41.156
terrific dad...

29:41.198 --> 29:43.700
and no woman snatched you?

29:45.702 --> 29:48.747
OK, so what's the real problem?

29:51.542 --> 29:53.836
Well...

29:53.877 --> 29:54.878
Come on.

29:54.920 --> 29:56.338
I guess I'm old-fashioned.

29:56.380 --> 29:57.923
You know?

29:58.006 --> 30:01.677
I like to be the chaser.

30:01.718 --> 30:03.554
Oh, really?

30:04.972 --> 30:06.640
Is that you, Penny?

30:06.723 --> 30:07.641
Well, it's about time.

30:07.724 --> 30:09.685
That's a shame.

30:09.726 --> 30:11.478
That is a shame,

30:11.562 --> 30:14.398
Gonna burn that little girl.

30:14.481 --> 30:15.732
Lord have mercy.

30:15.816 --> 30:18.861
What make people be so mean to children?

30:18.944 --> 30:20.904
They like to make up stories.

30:20.946 --> 30:22.406
Sure. OK. Bye-bye.

30:23.949 --> 30:24.950
Didn't I tell you...

30:25.033 --> 30:26.368
to come straight home from school?

30:26.410 --> 30:27.536
Come here.

30:31.415 --> 30:32.624
Where you been?

30:34.126 --> 30:36.211
I had to go to my friend's house.

30:36.253 --> 30:37.963
What friend?

30:38.046 --> 30:39.381
You don't know her.

30:41.592 --> 30:43.427
I want you in this house...

30:43.510 --> 30:44.720
before the streetlights come on.

30:44.761 --> 30:45.846
Do you hear me?

30:45.929 --> 30:48.098
- Yeah.
- Yes, what?

30:48.182 --> 30:49.391
Yes, ma'am.

30:52.978 --> 30:54.980
How was school?

30:55.063 --> 30:56.356
Good.

30:56.440 --> 30:58.108
Got any homework?

30:58.192 --> 31:02.362
I did it already.

31:02.446 --> 31:04.490
In what?

31:04.573 --> 31:05.949
Algebra.

31:06.033 --> 31:07.242
Algebra, huh?

31:09.453 --> 31:10.662
Don't do it.

31:10.746 --> 31:12.998
Don't whup the girl. Don't do it, Mabel.

31:14.208 --> 31:15.918
I done told you, you...

31:15.959 --> 31:17.336
Hey, come here!

31:17.419 --> 31:19.963
OK, OK, OK!

31:20.047 --> 31:21.924
Mabel, you jiggling like jell-o.

31:22.007 --> 31:23.509
Turn around here.

31:23.592 --> 31:24.843
You stop that! You better...

31:24.927 --> 31:26.595
Girl, look at me! Look at me.

31:26.678 --> 31:29.097
Why wasn't you at school today?

31:29.181 --> 31:31.225
I went to the park.

31:31.308 --> 31:32.476
She lyin'.

31:32.559 --> 31:34.186
What was you doin' in the park?

31:34.269 --> 31:35.938
You supposed to be at the schoolhouse.

31:37.481 --> 31:39.608
Little girl, I'm not
gonna ask you no more.

31:39.691 --> 31:42.277
I'm not smart like the other kids.

31:42.319 --> 31:44.154
I can't do that stuff.

31:44.238 --> 31:46.073
Who told you that?

31:46.156 --> 31:49.326
My last foster mother.

31:49.409 --> 31:50.828
She told me the only thing...

31:50.911 --> 31:53.872
I'm gonna be smart enough
to do is lay on my back.

31:53.956 --> 31:55.332
Was your foster mother Jennifer?

31:55.415 --> 31:58.377
I know Jennifer. I know her.
That's all she used to do.

31:58.460 --> 32:01.213
Shut up, Joe. I'm trying
to talk to this child.

32:01.296 --> 32:03.465
The best revenge you
can have on somebody...

32:03.549 --> 32:05.217
that told you something like that...

32:05.300 --> 32:06.677
is to prove them wrong.

32:06.760 --> 32:08.262
Best revenge you can have...

32:08.345 --> 32:09.429
is to kick they butt.

32:09.513 --> 32:10.514
That's the best revenge.

32:10.597 --> 32:13.141
I went to that school,
and I got your homework.

32:13.225 --> 32:14.518
Talked to your teacher.

32:14.601 --> 32:17.521
She said this is what you
have to do in the morning...

32:17.563 --> 32:19.940
so go up there and get it done.

32:20.023 --> 32:22.150
Can you help me with it?

32:30.409 --> 32:31.827
It's algebra.

32:33.412 --> 32:35.622
Honey, I don't know
nothing about that algebra.

32:35.706 --> 32:37.708
When I was in school, we had 3 R's.

32:37.791 --> 32:38.709
Read, write, 'rithmetic.

32:38.792 --> 32:40.294
I don't know nothing about algeroe.

32:40.377 --> 32:42.796
'Cause she dumb as hell.
If it ain't got no food...

32:42.880 --> 32:43.839
or sugar on it...

32:43.922 --> 32:45.507
she can't figure out what it is.

32:45.591 --> 32:46.967
All she do is eat.

32:47.050 --> 32:48.927
Go upstairs. I'm gonna
get you Tiffany's number.

32:49.011 --> 32:51.180
That's Brian's daughter.
She'll be able to help you.

32:51.221 --> 32:53.223
She's a little older than
you. She can help you.

32:53.307 --> 32:55.517
Better be at school when
I tell you to go to school.

32:57.394 --> 33:01.523
I look in the mirror

33:06.904 --> 33:09.406
I don't know

33:09.490 --> 33:11.909
Who's staring back at me

33:15.078 --> 33:20.042
A soul gets lost

33:23.003 --> 33:24.338
Controlled

33:24.421 --> 33:28.300
By his lovin' in the mirror

33:30.844 --> 33:33.138
The reflection

33:33.222 --> 33:36.433
From your eyes

33:39.520 --> 33:40.562
I didn't know that.

33:40.646 --> 33:42.189
I didn't know that. Did you?

33:42.272 --> 33:44.775
No. That is hilarious.

33:44.858 --> 33:46.318
Lisa, this man is a riot.

33:46.401 --> 33:47.778
Yes, he is.

33:47.861 --> 33:50.781
So you have to tell me the
rest of the story, Carlos.

33:51.824 --> 33:53.784
How is the wedding planning coming?

33:53.867 --> 33:55.244
Great.

33:55.327 --> 33:57.329
You must be so excited.

33:57.412 --> 34:01.083
Over the moon.

34:04.711 --> 34:06.421
Excuse me.

34:06.463 --> 34:08.632
Sorry.

34:08.715 --> 34:10.926
Long nights.

34:17.431 --> 34:19.268
You want to dance, honey?

34:19.309 --> 34:21.228
Yes.

34:21.311 --> 34:22.603
You sure?

34:22.646 --> 34:24.773
- Yeah.
- OK.

34:24.815 --> 34:26.358
All right, y'all excuse us please?

34:26.440 --> 34:27.484
Excuse me.

34:29.570 --> 34:31.071
She'll love it.

34:31.155 --> 34:33.699
They are such a lovely couple.

34:39.705 --> 34:41.748
Why do you insist on embarrassing me?

34:41.831 --> 34:44.083
I'm sorry. I'm a little tired...

34:44.168 --> 34:45.127
that's all.

34:45.168 --> 34:47.838
When I get you outta here...

34:47.920 --> 34:49.047
I don't understand.

34:49.130 --> 34:51.175
Shut up.

34:51.257 --> 34:53.385
Can't take you anywhere.

34:55.053 --> 34:56.597
Just wait.

34:58.348 --> 34:59.558
Just wait.

35:07.065 --> 35:10.360
Let's not wait, Carlos.

35:10.444 --> 35:12.362
Just do it now.

35:12.446 --> 35:13.947
Just hit me...

35:14.031 --> 35:15.741
so all your friends can see...

35:15.824 --> 35:18.160
what kind of a man you really are.

35:24.124 --> 35:26.126
You love to provoke me, don't you?

35:28.253 --> 35:30.672
Why do you insist on
doing things the hard way?

35:30.756 --> 35:32.841
You love it when I'm not myself?

35:32.925 --> 35:36.011
You like the highs and lows of me?

35:38.847 --> 35:40.641
But you always play the victim, baby.

35:44.895 --> 35:46.021
I'm leaving.

35:49.525 --> 35:51.527
No, you're not.

35:51.610 --> 35:53.737
Baby, this dance ain't over.

35:55.239 --> 35:57.991
And if you think you're
talking about leaving me...

35:58.075 --> 35:59.368
well...

35:59.451 --> 36:02.120
I love you to death...

36:03.705 --> 36:05.833
and I mean that.

36:28.605 --> 36:31.191
Excuse me. Excuse me.

36:31.275 --> 36:33.777
I'm old. Hell, I can't hold it no more.

36:33.861 --> 36:35.863
All ya'll be knowin' I got to fart.

36:35.946 --> 36:38.240
Sometimes it just run on out.

36:38.282 --> 36:39.741
Gotta do what you gotta do.

36:39.783 --> 36:41.076
That's right.

36:41.118 --> 36:43.412
When you get to be
this age, you'll know.

36:43.453 --> 36:44.913
Farts come free.

36:44.997 --> 36:46.415
You be tryin' to hold it...

36:46.498 --> 36:47.583
you mess around...

36:47.624 --> 36:48.876
blow your eyes out tryin' to hold it.

36:50.919 --> 36:52.838
I'm just playing with you here.

36:52.921 --> 36:54.464
I tried to hold it one time, man...

36:54.548 --> 36:56.008
I just started crampin' up...

36:56.091 --> 36:57.384
'cause I was around a bunch of people...

36:57.467 --> 36:59.428
on the aeroplane.

36:59.511 --> 37:02.389
I had to let it go.
You got to let it go!

37:02.472 --> 37:04.266
When it's time to let it go...

37:04.308 --> 37:05.392
you gotta let it go.

37:05.475 --> 37:06.435
- Let it go and let God.
- Go ahead.

37:06.518 --> 37:08.478
That's nature. Yep, nature.

37:08.520 --> 37:10.480
I'm fixin' to let go. Let it go.

37:12.149 --> 37:13.650
Good job.

37:13.734 --> 37:16.111
That was beautiful.

37:16.195 --> 37:18.280
Music to my ears.

37:20.491 --> 37:22.493
I hear you're gonna
take her out somewhere.

37:28.499 --> 37:29.791
You gonna get some?

37:35.172 --> 37:36.423
Nah, we're just...

37:36.507 --> 37:38.133
We're just going to dinner.

37:38.175 --> 37:39.468
Dinner? That's all that means.

37:39.510 --> 37:41.595
When you ask a woman to dinner...

37:41.678 --> 37:43.305
that means you're fixin' to get some.

37:43.347 --> 37:45.516
Nasty bastard! Always in my house!

37:45.599 --> 37:47.059
Passing gas!

37:49.019 --> 37:53.315
Oh. How you doing? I'm Mabel. Hello.

37:53.398 --> 37:55.150
Yeah.

37:55.192 --> 37:57.110
- Nice to meet you.
- Good to meet you.

37:57.194 --> 37:59.488
Have a seat. She'll be down in a minute.

37:59.571 --> 38:01.323
- Want something to drink?
- I'm OK. Thank you.

38:01.365 --> 38:02.991
Sit down. Sit down. Rest yourself.

38:09.540 --> 38:12.334
You know she's got two kids, don't ya?

38:12.376 --> 38:15.462
Yes, I do. I know.

38:16.797 --> 38:18.924
And you still want to go out with her?

38:19.007 --> 38:20.801
I got a son, too.

38:20.884 --> 38:22.344
You must be desperate.

38:22.386 --> 38:24.513
Joe, shut up.

38:26.014 --> 38:28.475
Be careful now, she's fertile.

38:30.769 --> 38:32.479
Fertile. She gets pregnant easy.

38:32.563 --> 38:35.315
Shut the hell up.

38:37.943 --> 38:40.404
Hey! Hey!

38:40.487 --> 38:42.156
Don't you look beautiful, honey?

38:42.239 --> 38:43.782
Hi.

38:46.243 --> 38:47.286
You ready?

38:47.369 --> 38:49.246
Yeah.

38:50.414 --> 38:52.040
You go on. I got these kids.

38:52.124 --> 38:53.125
Thanks a lot.

38:53.208 --> 38:54.168
All right, baby.

38:54.251 --> 38:57.087
- Nice to meet you guys.
- Good night.

38:57.171 --> 38:58.589
All right. See you later, Rocky.

38:58.672 --> 38:59.590
Frankie.

38:59.673 --> 39:03.260
Whatever. Rocky, Rocko, whatever.

39:03.343 --> 39:05.304
Do the rocka-wear.

39:07.931 --> 39:10.225
You know she coming back
here pregnant, don't ya?

39:24.740 --> 39:26.241
The sunlight danced across her body...

39:26.325 --> 39:27.784
as lightning flashed.

39:27.868 --> 39:30.746
I knew God had to be angry.

39:30.829 --> 39:32.915
Of course she was mine and I was hers...

39:32.998 --> 39:34.166
but only for that moment...

39:34.249 --> 39:36.168
because just as the sun...

39:36.251 --> 39:39.379
interrupted the moon...

39:39.463 --> 39:42.716
I knew that evening would end.

39:42.799 --> 39:44.426
And so would we...

39:44.468 --> 39:46.720
because we both were...

39:46.803 --> 39:48.430
a part of another family.

39:48.514 --> 39:50.557
Thank you.

40:01.527 --> 40:03.862
I knew you were gonna like it.

40:03.946 --> 40:06.198
Tonight's poets and painters' night.

40:06.281 --> 40:08.283
The poet speaks and the painter paints.

40:08.367 --> 40:11.829
But the catch is you
only have two minutes.

40:11.870 --> 40:12.871
It's fun.

40:12.955 --> 40:15.123
What I want you to
do right now, crowd...

40:15.165 --> 40:17.626
is put your hands together
for Frankie and Vanessa.

40:30.138 --> 40:34.101
I'm a little nervous about this.

40:34.184 --> 40:36.436
I didn't know that he signed us up.

40:36.520 --> 40:37.813
We're all family here.

40:37.855 --> 40:40.649
You all show 'em some love, please.

40:42.985 --> 40:45.946
This is called...

40:46.029 --> 40:50.492
"The courage to love."

40:58.709 --> 41:01.795
It takes courage...

41:01.879 --> 41:03.505
to love again...

41:03.589 --> 41:05.007
when you've been hurt.

41:11.054 --> 41:13.640
It takes pain...

41:13.724 --> 41:16.393
and strength again...

41:21.106 --> 41:24.651
To pack it all away.

41:24.735 --> 41:30.365
Somewhere in all the pain...

41:30.449 --> 41:34.077
somebody has to have the courage...

41:38.165 --> 41:40.584
to be OK.

41:46.256 --> 41:48.550
Pain...

41:48.592 --> 41:49.635
gives...

41:49.718 --> 41:51.386
me...

41:51.428 --> 41:52.554
courage...

41:54.640 --> 41:56.058
to love.

42:01.021 --> 42:02.606
Thank you.

43:31.278 --> 43:33.906
I don't know why I keep doing this.

43:33.989 --> 43:35.407
I mean, things are good.

43:35.491 --> 43:38.911
When they're good, they're good, right?

43:44.833 --> 43:47.002
I'm sorry, Lisa.

43:49.129 --> 43:53.091
I love you so much, and
l... and I... I can't...

44:01.725 --> 44:04.353
I'm gonna go to counseling.

44:07.314 --> 44:10.275
Just don't leave me.

44:10.359 --> 44:13.195
OK? I'm gonna get help, just...

44:17.574 --> 44:19.868
Everybody I love leaves me.

44:22.412 --> 44:24.540
I can't do this anymore.

44:26.917 --> 44:28.418
I just said I was sorry.

44:29.753 --> 44:31.713
That's not enough.

44:35.759 --> 44:37.344
Wha...

44:39.513 --> 44:41.723
You want to leave me?

44:43.475 --> 44:44.935
Do you want to leave me?!

44:53.777 --> 44:55.112
OK.

45:00.951 --> 45:03.328
That's the only way
you're gonna leave me.

45:08.125 --> 45:09.126
Stop!

45:10.210 --> 45:12.087
- No! Stop!
- You want to go?

45:12.129 --> 45:13.213
Stop it! Please!

45:13.297 --> 45:14.423
OK! OK!

45:14.506 --> 45:16.049
I'll stay!

45:16.133 --> 45:17.259
What?!

45:17.342 --> 45:18.886
I'll stay! What?

45:18.969 --> 45:21.388
Say it louder. Say it louder.

45:21.471 --> 45:25.225
I'll stay! I'll stay!

45:36.069 --> 45:37.613
I'll stay.

45:41.783 --> 45:44.077
Tell me that you love me.

45:46.663 --> 45:48.582
I love you.

45:50.501 --> 45:52.211
Tell me that you love me again.

45:52.294 --> 45:53.212
I love you.

45:53.295 --> 45:54.213
Say it again.

45:54.296 --> 45:58.091
I love you. I love you.

46:08.477 --> 46:11.146
OK. OK.

46:12.314 --> 46:13.899
It's gonna be OK.

46:25.410 --> 46:30.833
I have never, in all my
life, had such a good time.

46:30.874 --> 46:34.670
You should have called
me a long time ago.

46:36.588 --> 46:37.840
When my son was born...

46:37.881 --> 46:40.551
I turned my life over to God...

46:42.052 --> 46:43.720
and I've been celibate since then...

46:43.804 --> 46:47.766
and I will be until I get married.

46:47.850 --> 46:50.477
It's just easier not to date.

46:54.481 --> 46:58.193
Is that what you think
I wanted from you, sex?

47:00.237 --> 47:03.907
Let's be honest. All
men come for something.

47:07.077 --> 47:09.037
Some men come to restore.

47:16.086 --> 47:18.338
I had a really good time tonight.

47:22.426 --> 47:24.428
Thank you.

49:14.204 --> 49:16.165
So...

49:16.248 --> 49:20.002
Donna tells me that you
have been out every night...

49:20.043 --> 49:22.671
with a certain bus driver.

49:22.754 --> 49:25.507
He's a great guy.

49:25.549 --> 49:27.217
He loves kids.

49:29.553 --> 49:30.512
Just when I thought...

49:30.596 --> 49:33.891
that every man was gonna be the same...

49:33.974 --> 49:35.350
here he comes.

49:35.392 --> 49:38.020
I think you're in love.

49:38.103 --> 49:41.690
I'm... in strong like.

49:45.110 --> 49:46.987
Besides, you're the one getting married.

49:47.070 --> 49:49.198
You're the one in love.

49:52.284 --> 49:55.078
I don't love him...

49:55.162 --> 49:57.039
the way he loves me.

49:57.122 --> 49:59.708
Then why are you marrying him?

49:59.791 --> 50:01.335
Mom says love will come.

50:02.628 --> 50:04.046
Mom.

50:04.129 --> 50:05.047
Don't do that.

50:05.130 --> 50:06.256
You listen to me.

50:06.340 --> 50:07.716
Don't blame her.

50:07.799 --> 50:09.092
She has had you under her thumb...

50:09.176 --> 50:10.385
since you were born.

50:10.469 --> 50:11.887
She lives her life through you.

50:11.970 --> 50:15.766
Don't you wanna just make
a decision on your own?

50:15.849 --> 50:17.309
Just once?

50:17.392 --> 50:18.852
Lisa, you gotta learn to fight.

50:18.936 --> 50:20.938
Fight?

50:21.021 --> 50:24.358
I've never had to fight before.

50:24.441 --> 50:26.902
Somebody has always fought for me.

50:26.985 --> 50:31.740
And I can't... I can't fight him.

50:31.824 --> 50:34.243
He just gets so angry.

50:34.326 --> 50:37.830
Is he hitting you?

50:44.294 --> 50:45.504
Yeah.

50:48.090 --> 50:50.300
Hell, no! Madea!

50:51.927 --> 50:53.136
You are staying here tonight!

50:53.220 --> 50:54.471
Do you understand me?

50:54.555 --> 50:55.764
Promise me you will not say anything.

50:55.806 --> 50:56.932
What's going on?

51:02.229 --> 51:04.106
We have a friend...

51:04.148 --> 51:06.275
and her husband is beating her...

51:06.358 --> 51:08.110
and we would just like to know...

51:08.193 --> 51:09.403
what we should do.

51:09.486 --> 51:12.406
Before or after his funeral?

51:16.827 --> 51:18.453
Does she want to get out?

51:18.537 --> 51:20.497
Does she?

51:22.082 --> 51:24.334
Yes.

51:24.418 --> 51:26.295
But he won't let her.

51:28.672 --> 51:31.258
Sit down. Let me tell you a story.

51:33.260 --> 51:35.387
Sit down.

51:37.681 --> 51:39.099
I'm 'a tell you this.

51:39.183 --> 51:41.518
Can't nobody help your friend
until she wanna get help.

51:41.602 --> 51:43.687
You can want all your
life to help somebody...

51:43.770 --> 51:45.272
but if they don't want to get help...

51:45.355 --> 51:46.607
it ain't gonna happen.

51:46.690 --> 51:48.108
You listen to me.

51:48.192 --> 51:51.737
When you get tired of a
man hittin' on you, honey...

51:51.820 --> 51:56.241
ain't nothing you can do
but cook breakfast for him.

51:56.325 --> 51:58.118
Cook breakfast.

51:58.202 --> 51:59.328
Bring him into the kitchen...

51:59.411 --> 52:02.331
and get you a big old
pot of hot grits...

52:02.414 --> 52:04.458
and when it start to boil like lava...

52:04.541 --> 52:06.168
and after he got good and comfortable...

52:06.251 --> 52:07.753
you say, "good morning."

52:07.836 --> 52:10.214
Throw it right on him.

52:10.297 --> 52:11.673
Get you a pot like this...

52:13.383 --> 52:14.968
Take it and throw it.

52:15.052 --> 52:16.678
You need you a skillet...

52:16.762 --> 52:19.264
with a nice good balanced weight on it.

52:19.348 --> 52:20.265
You understand?

52:20.349 --> 52:22.518
And as you throw it, you swat.

52:22.559 --> 52:24.186
Throw it and swat, you hear me?

52:24.269 --> 52:25.854
Throw it and swat.

52:25.938 --> 52:27.481
Venus and Serena.

52:27.564 --> 52:29.149
That's called grit ball.

52:34.488 --> 52:37.574
So the third-quarter
profit should be up 17%.

52:37.658 --> 52:39.159
Beautiful work, everyone.

52:39.243 --> 52:41.411
I will see you all tomorrow.

52:43.539 --> 52:44.915
Thank you.

52:46.750 --> 52:49.461
Kevin, don't forget that
wire transfer, all right?

52:52.965 --> 52:54.091
Mr. Armstrong...

52:54.174 --> 52:56.510
a Victoria Breaux is here to see you.

52:56.593 --> 52:57.886
Send her in.

53:03.141 --> 53:04.476
Hello, Carlos.

53:05.602 --> 53:06.895
I rushed right over.

53:06.937 --> 53:09.648
She hasn't been home in 3 days.

53:09.731 --> 53:11.275
My patience is wearing thin.

53:11.358 --> 53:14.695
How can I convince her
what a great man you are...

53:14.778 --> 53:16.947
if you insist on acting
like such a savage?

53:17.030 --> 53:18.240
Savage?

53:18.282 --> 53:20.993
I'm a collector of beautiful things.

53:21.076 --> 53:22.870
Now, would I scratch my Monet?

53:22.953 --> 53:24.955
Would I deface my Picasso?

53:25.038 --> 53:27.207
I won't keep bringing
my child back to you...

53:27.291 --> 53:29.418
if you continue to
put your hands on her.

53:29.459 --> 53:32.045
Your child? You almost
sound like her mother.

53:32.129 --> 53:35.090
Let's not get this thing twisted.

53:35.132 --> 53:37.301
I've been your banker
for the last 4 years.

53:37.384 --> 53:40.345
I know better than
anyone why you want this.

53:40.429 --> 53:43.223
I am not the only one benefiting here.

53:45.559 --> 53:47.728
If she found out...

53:47.811 --> 53:51.148
that I have had access
to her trust fund...

53:51.231 --> 53:53.108
through you, Mr. Investment banker...

53:53.150 --> 53:56.195
you are on the line as well.

53:56.278 --> 53:58.697
Now here are the rules of engagement.

53:58.780 --> 54:01.825
You will not hit her again.

54:01.909 --> 54:04.119
And I will tell her that
you're getting counseling...

54:04.203 --> 54:06.163
which may not be such a bad idea.

54:06.246 --> 54:08.248
I read about women like you.

54:08.332 --> 54:10.542
Women who live their lives
through their daughters...

54:10.626 --> 54:13.504
entering them into
pageants and acting classes.

54:13.587 --> 54:15.714
'Cause you really want
to be her, don't you?

54:15.797 --> 54:18.759
I've read about men like you, too.

54:18.842 --> 54:20.761
Overachievers.

54:20.844 --> 54:24.139
Trying to make up for what they lack.

54:24.181 --> 54:27.684
Controlling because they
really are insecure...

54:27.768 --> 54:28.727
and they think...

54:28.811 --> 54:30.854
that when they're in public...

54:30.938 --> 54:33.649
everyone can see their little secret.

54:44.034 --> 54:46.870
You want me, don't you?

54:50.833 --> 54:53.001
Don't flatter yourself.

54:55.629 --> 54:57.506
You see, I like men.

54:57.548 --> 54:59.550
Real men...

54:59.633 --> 55:02.553
and not little boys who
throw temper tantrums...

55:02.636 --> 55:04.471
'cause they can't control little girls.

55:04.555 --> 55:06.348
Your horns are showing.

55:06.431 --> 55:09.643
Are you upset because mine are bigger?

55:09.726 --> 55:11.228
And...

55:11.311 --> 55:14.064
for the record...

55:14.148 --> 55:16.900
if I wanted you...

55:16.984 --> 55:18.986
I could have you.

55:19.069 --> 55:22.447
I think the saddest
thing I've ever seen...

55:24.283 --> 55:25.659
Was Ali...

55:27.161 --> 55:30.205
fighting past his prime.

55:30.289 --> 55:34.501
Or Sinatra singing
after his voice was shot.

55:34.585 --> 55:36.545
Now, what I love about Lena Horne...

55:36.587 --> 55:39.173
see, Lena Horne was a lady...

55:39.256 --> 55:44.553
and a lady always knows when to leave.

55:49.266 --> 55:50.726
So, what are you?

55:50.767 --> 55:52.853
I'm a lady who's got you by the balls.

55:52.936 --> 55:56.273
I want your daughter
in my house... tonight!

56:14.625 --> 56:15.542
I better go.

56:15.626 --> 56:16.919
No, no, no.

56:19.838 --> 56:21.089
Come here.

56:21.173 --> 56:22.966
I'm gonna show you something.

56:26.595 --> 56:28.430
What is it?

56:34.353 --> 56:37.856
I call it "Vanessa's rain."

56:37.940 --> 56:40.859
The passion in your eyes.

56:40.943 --> 56:44.154
This red line represents...

56:44.238 --> 56:45.322
the pain...

56:45.405 --> 56:48.867
that you're trying to hide from me...

56:48.951 --> 56:50.744
and this is your heart.

56:50.828 --> 56:53.038
That's where I wanna be.

56:58.043 --> 57:00.212
What?

57:00.295 --> 57:02.756
No one's ever done anything like this...

57:02.840 --> 57:05.509
for me before.

57:05.592 --> 57:08.470
It's so special.

57:14.309 --> 57:16.311
You're special.

58:26.256 --> 58:28.383
You already ate yours. This is mommy's.

58:28.425 --> 58:29.384
Hey!

58:29.426 --> 58:30.886
What are you doing with my kids?!

58:30.928 --> 58:32.513
He bought us ice cream.

58:32.554 --> 58:35.015
You OK?

58:36.058 --> 58:39.019
- Yeah?
- Yeah!

58:39.102 --> 58:40.979
Come here. Come here.

58:41.063 --> 58:42.189
I'm 'a go play with cars.

58:42.272 --> 58:44.650
Come here. Let me see you.

58:44.733 --> 58:47.820
OK. OK.

58:47.903 --> 58:48.987
I want you to go pack your things...

58:49.071 --> 58:51.365
'cause we're gonna go, OK?

58:53.283 --> 58:55.577
Did I do something wrong?

58:57.120 --> 58:58.622
I don't know you well enough...

58:58.705 --> 59:00.207
for you to be taking my kids...

59:00.290 --> 59:01.917
and I don't know where you're going!

59:02.000 --> 59:04.127
All right. I'll take you home.

59:04.211 --> 59:07.548
No, we're gonna be fine.

59:07.589 --> 59:10.551
Nima, come on, now!
Right now! Right now!

59:10.592 --> 59:12.094
Kids, look, mommy's gonna talk...

59:12.177 --> 59:14.346
to Uncle Frankie for
a second, all right?

59:14.429 --> 59:15.722
We'll be right back.

59:19.977 --> 59:22.771
Look, I'm sorry, all right?

59:22.855 --> 59:26.650
You were sleeping so peacefully,
and I know you're tired.

59:26.733 --> 59:27.985
Now, the kids were up...

59:28.068 --> 59:29.361
and I didn't want them to wake you...

59:29.444 --> 59:30.821
so I took 'em out for some ice cream.

59:32.197 --> 59:33.615
I just wanted you to rest.

59:38.328 --> 59:42.166
Nobody is gonna hurt my kids.

59:42.249 --> 59:43.375
I love you.

59:47.462 --> 59:51.842
Don't you know I would
never, ever hurt your kids...

59:52.634 --> 59:54.094
or you?

01:00:02.478 --> 01:00:03.896
I think that...

01:00:04.980 --> 01:00:05.939
"You think that."

01:00:06.023 --> 01:00:07.316
Don't tell me what you think.

01:00:07.399 --> 01:00:08.525
Hey, tell me...

01:00:09.359 --> 01:00:10.986
Tell me what you feel.

01:00:14.198 --> 01:00:15.657
I feel that...

01:00:17.075 --> 01:00:18.827
that you won't hurt them.

01:00:20.370 --> 01:00:21.997
Or you.

01:00:24.541 --> 01:00:25.792
Or me.

01:00:35.719 --> 01:00:37.346
Oh, God.

01:00:54.530 --> 01:00:56.865
You almost knocked me down here.

01:00:58.700 --> 01:01:00.744
You know I don't allow
no running in this house.

01:01:00.828 --> 01:01:01.787
Look.

01:01:02.913 --> 01:01:04.665
Ah, you got a "B."

01:01:04.706 --> 01:01:06.375
Go ahead, honey, you smart.

01:01:06.458 --> 01:01:07.376
I am.

01:01:07.459 --> 01:01:08.377
Yes, that's wonderful.

01:01:08.460 --> 01:01:10.921
I never would have been able
to figure out that algeroe...

01:01:11.004 --> 01:01:12.381
and you done figured it out.

01:01:12.422 --> 01:01:14.007
That is good.

01:01:14.091 --> 01:01:16.844
You did prove you can be
anything you want to be.

01:01:16.885 --> 01:01:18.011
Go ahead on.

01:01:18.095 --> 01:01:21.181
I look at all the kids at school...

01:01:21.265 --> 01:01:22.808
and they have parents to help them.

01:01:24.268 --> 01:01:25.686
Well, that make you smarter than them...

01:01:25.727 --> 01:01:27.980
'cause you figured it
out all by yourself.

01:01:28.063 --> 01:01:29.231
Where your folks at anyway?

01:01:29.273 --> 01:01:31.066
When is they coming to get you?

01:01:31.108 --> 01:01:32.568
That's what I want to know.

01:01:32.609 --> 01:01:35.571
I never knew my daddy,
and my mama's in jail.

01:01:35.654 --> 01:01:37.698
I got a bunch of kids I never knew.

01:01:37.739 --> 01:01:39.449
I might be your daddy.

01:01:39.533 --> 01:01:42.536
Joe, this baby can stay
here long as she want to.

01:01:42.578 --> 01:01:44.872
The hell she can.

01:01:44.913 --> 01:01:45.914
Can I?

01:01:45.998 --> 01:01:47.749
Yes, till you go off to college.

01:01:47.791 --> 01:01:48.750
College?

01:01:48.792 --> 01:01:50.419
Smart as you is, you better go.

01:01:50.502 --> 01:01:52.713
It ain't where you come from, honey...

01:01:52.754 --> 01:01:53.714
it's where you going.

01:01:53.755 --> 01:01:55.799
No matter what your mama
was or who your daddy was...

01:01:55.883 --> 01:01:57.009
you can be anything you want to be.

01:01:57.092 --> 01:01:58.510
Look at Brian.

01:01:58.594 --> 01:01:59.845
He turned out to be a lawyer.

01:01:59.928 --> 01:02:01.096
Look at his daddy...

01:02:01.138 --> 01:02:03.599
a big old lump of nothing.

01:02:03.682 --> 01:02:07.019
Better a lump of nothing
than a lump of cow manu-der.

01:02:10.439 --> 01:02:11.940
What you want to be when you grow up?

01:02:12.774 --> 01:02:14.067
A lawyer.

01:02:14.151 --> 01:02:15.235
Oh, a lawyer. That's good...

01:02:15.319 --> 01:02:16.612
'cause I might need you to get me off...

01:02:16.653 --> 01:02:18.071
after I kill him... Murder One.

01:02:20.782 --> 01:02:21.742
I'm gonna be a lawyer.

01:02:21.783 --> 01:02:22.743
I'm gonna go call Tiffany.

01:02:22.784 --> 01:02:24.203
OK, go call Tiffany.

01:02:24.286 --> 01:02:25.871
Gonna be a lawyer. Go ahead, baby.

01:02:26.663 --> 01:02:29.750
You know how much college cost
for that child to be a lawyer?

01:02:29.833 --> 01:02:30.959
Who gonna pay for it?

01:02:31.043 --> 01:02:34.087
Well, I figure if you
do us a favor and die...

01:02:34.171 --> 01:02:36.465
we can use your insurance money.

01:02:36.548 --> 01:02:39.510
I wouldn't give you the satisfaction.

01:02:39.593 --> 01:02:42.095
You could sell milk... "got milk?"

01:02:42.179 --> 01:02:43.096
Go straight to hell, Joe.

01:02:43.180 --> 01:02:44.097
I'm already talking about somebody.

01:02:44.181 --> 01:02:45.265
Just shut up.

01:02:46.725 --> 01:02:48.852
Knock-knock.

01:02:48.936 --> 01:02:51.230
Oh, Uncle Joe.

01:02:51.313 --> 01:02:52.356
Hi, Madea.

01:02:53.315 --> 01:02:54.691
Where is Lisa?

01:02:54.775 --> 01:02:55.776
She upstairs somewhere.

01:02:55.818 --> 01:02:58.070
Go on, turn around so I
can watch you walk out.

01:03:01.782 --> 01:03:02.991
Knock-knock-knock.

01:03:04.701 --> 01:03:06.995
Honey, I came to get you.

01:03:07.079 --> 01:03:08.622
I brought you a little something.

01:03:18.549 --> 01:03:20.008
She doesn't want to marry this man.

01:03:21.176 --> 01:03:23.345
I'm not gonna argue with you about this.

01:03:23.387 --> 01:03:24.471
Then don't.

01:03:24.555 --> 01:03:25.973
Is this how you want to live?

01:03:26.014 --> 01:03:27.266
Pathetic like your sister?

01:03:28.559 --> 01:03:29.810
Look how she lives.

01:03:29.852 --> 01:03:31.353
Is this what you want?

01:03:31.436 --> 01:03:33.689
Why are you trying to make
her think this is about her?

01:03:34.857 --> 01:03:37.484
You've been living off her
trust fund all these years...

01:03:37.568 --> 01:03:40.279
and now that it's almost
gone, you need a new source.

01:03:40.362 --> 01:03:41.488
My dad left her money.

01:03:41.572 --> 01:03:42.865
He didn't leave her a dime.

01:03:42.906 --> 01:03:46.493
He left it all for his
first wife. She's broke.

01:03:46.577 --> 01:03:47.786
Stop lying to your sister.

01:03:47.870 --> 01:03:49.204
What?

01:03:52.207 --> 01:03:54.501
Lisa, you remember all those trips...

01:03:54.585 --> 01:03:57.296
that you took to the museum
with Mother on the weekends...

01:03:57.379 --> 01:03:58.881
when I was left at home...

01:03:58.964 --> 01:04:01.592
and she would tell you
I was being punished?

01:04:01.675 --> 01:04:03.886
I came here to try to
smooth things out with you...

01:04:03.927 --> 01:04:06.513
but if you want to continue
telling these lies, I'm leaving.

01:04:08.932 --> 01:04:10.184
No, you're not.

01:04:10.225 --> 01:04:12.227
You're gonna sit right
there. You're gonna listen.

01:04:14.062 --> 01:04:16.815
Lisa, one day, I was sitting
at the bottom of the stairs...

01:04:16.899 --> 01:04:19.443
and I heard Mom and your
dad arguing about me.

01:04:23.363 --> 01:04:25.824
You're too young to remember,
but he was gonna leave.

01:04:25.908 --> 01:04:27.159
Oh, my God.

01:04:27.242 --> 01:04:28.911
And I heard Mom say, "No."

01:04:30.120 --> 01:04:31.497
"Don't. Please.

01:04:31.580 --> 01:04:34.041
"I'll do it. I'll do it."

01:04:34.124 --> 01:04:36.084
And I didn't know what
she was talking about.

01:04:38.921 --> 01:04:40.881
When she came in, she found me.

01:04:43.884 --> 01:04:45.886
Then she put me in the bathtub...

01:04:52.476 --> 01:04:54.061
and she combed my hair...

01:04:59.274 --> 01:05:01.318
and she put make-up on me...

01:05:07.241 --> 01:05:09.201
and perfume.

01:05:12.830 --> 01:05:14.414
And she said...

01:05:17.125 --> 01:05:19.002
"Just relax."

01:05:25.008 --> 01:05:29.263
And then she let him
come in and rape me.

01:05:29.304 --> 01:05:31.640
That is not true.

01:05:31.723 --> 01:05:34.810
Yes, it is true, and
you're gonna tell her.

01:05:34.893 --> 01:05:36.311
You are gonna tell her!

01:05:36.395 --> 01:05:37.646
He asked me for you.

01:05:38.313 --> 01:05:40.190
I had done everything
I could in our family...

01:05:40.274 --> 01:05:41.942
everything I could to please him.

01:05:42.985 --> 01:05:44.695
If we were gonna be comfortable...

01:05:44.778 --> 01:05:48.198
I had to make some hard, hard decisions.

01:05:49.825 --> 01:05:52.494
He would have walked out
and left us destitute.

01:05:52.578 --> 01:05:53.704
You should be happy...

01:05:53.787 --> 01:05:55.664
you were able to save our family.

01:05:55.747 --> 01:05:58.083
Are you insane?

01:05:58.167 --> 01:06:00.002
No. I'm a realist.

01:06:01.712 --> 01:06:03.505
I worked...

01:06:03.547 --> 01:06:05.382
worked two jobs.

01:06:06.258 --> 01:06:08.177
When your low-down
father walked out on me...

01:06:10.012 --> 01:06:13.056
and I was tired, and I deserved better.

01:06:13.140 --> 01:06:15.058
And when I snatched my
little bit of happiness...

01:06:15.142 --> 01:06:17.144
I was not gonna let you
take that away from me.

01:06:20.522 --> 01:06:21.857
Sweetheart...

01:06:22.941 --> 01:06:25.986
you were my only option.

01:06:27.905 --> 01:06:29.198
Mom...

01:06:29.239 --> 01:06:30.324
"Mom."

01:06:30.407 --> 01:06:32.993
Just stop that whining. Just stop it.

01:06:33.035 --> 01:06:36.288
I have taken care of you
like a little princess...

01:06:36.371 --> 01:06:38.665
the best schools, go
in designer clothes...

01:06:38.749 --> 01:06:39.833
all of that.

01:06:39.875 --> 01:06:42.461
Now it is time for
you to take care of me!

01:06:43.212 --> 01:06:44.546
You hear me?

01:06:45.797 --> 01:06:48.717
My mother was a real whore...

01:06:48.759 --> 01:06:49.843
and a junkie...

01:06:50.761 --> 01:06:52.262
and she traded me...

01:06:53.764 --> 01:06:55.766
for ten dollars and a fix.

01:07:03.774 --> 01:07:05.609
There are many things in
my life that I regret...

01:07:07.402 --> 01:07:09.530
including having you for a daughter...

01:07:09.571 --> 01:07:11.949
because that man was your father.

01:07:16.328 --> 01:07:18.330
But I will not...

01:07:20.791 --> 01:07:22.793
apologize for the decisions I made.

01:07:25.462 --> 01:07:27.548
I am not your tragedy.

01:07:28.924 --> 01:07:31.051
Lisa, I thought that she
was just controlling you...

01:07:31.134 --> 01:07:33.053
but she's been controlling me, too.

01:07:35.430 --> 01:07:39.685
I worry about my children...

01:07:39.768 --> 01:07:42.604
about what somebody's
gonna do to them...

01:07:42.688 --> 01:07:44.773
every second they're out of my sight.

01:07:46.817 --> 01:07:49.361
I have a man...

01:07:52.447 --> 01:07:55.367
who wants to love me...

01:07:55.450 --> 01:07:57.786
but I won't let him because of you.

01:07:59.121 --> 01:08:02.291
I refuse to let you
hold me back anymore.

01:08:04.835 --> 01:08:06.753
I'm gonna love hard.

01:08:08.589 --> 01:08:10.299
I'm gonna be a better mother.

01:08:13.177 --> 01:08:16.180
You don't win...

01:08:18.724 --> 01:08:21.727
because your
hand-me-downs stop here.

01:08:26.857 --> 01:08:28.734
I forgive you...

01:08:30.527 --> 01:08:32.321
with all my might...

01:08:38.160 --> 01:08:39.118
and I'm gonna pray...

01:08:39.161 --> 01:08:42.206
that God has mercy on your soul.

01:08:59.014 --> 01:09:00.349
Get your things.

01:09:00.432 --> 01:09:02.142
I'll wait for you in the car.

01:09:15.154 --> 01:09:16.782
I'm so sorry.

01:09:21.787 --> 01:09:23.497
No, I'm sorry.

01:10:10.919 --> 01:10:12.504
I told you to get off the phone.

01:10:12.588 --> 01:10:14.298
If you roll your eyes at me again...

01:10:14.381 --> 01:10:15.757
I'll take 'em out and turn 'em around...

01:10:15.841 --> 01:10:16.800
and have 'em looking at you.

01:10:19.261 --> 01:10:20.429
Lord have mercy.

01:10:21.263 --> 01:10:23.682
It's so good to see the
whole family together.

01:10:23.765 --> 01:10:25.017
Thank you, Madea.

01:10:25.100 --> 01:10:27.436
I try. I use my pistol
for some of 'em...

01:10:27.478 --> 01:10:28.770
'cause that's all they understood.

01:10:30.439 --> 01:10:31.815
I had to threaten half of 'em here.

01:10:31.899 --> 01:10:33.066
Aunt Ruby ninety-six.

01:10:33.108 --> 01:10:35.360
She needed to see all her family.

01:10:35.444 --> 01:10:36.528
I'm thirsty.

01:10:36.612 --> 01:10:38.071
Baby, get us some lemonade
out the house, please.

01:10:38.113 --> 01:10:39.114
Yes, ma'am.

01:10:41.617 --> 01:10:43.452
They told me she was a handful.

01:10:44.036 --> 01:10:45.913
How you get her to be so polite?

01:10:45.954 --> 01:10:47.539
I been tearing that ass up.

01:10:50.042 --> 01:10:51.627
I look at all these foster parents...

01:10:51.710 --> 01:10:53.629
taking these children in,
just trying to get money...

01:10:53.670 --> 01:10:54.755
but you know what I found out?

01:10:54.796 --> 01:10:56.548
Ain't nothing wrong with these children.

01:10:56.632 --> 01:10:59.092
All they need is some
love and support...

01:10:59.176 --> 01:11:00.761
and somebody be patient with them...

01:11:00.802 --> 01:11:01.929
and they'll be all right.

01:11:01.970 --> 01:11:04.264
That's what I found
out about these kids.

01:11:04.306 --> 01:11:06.433
Didn't I tell you to get
the hell off that telephone?

01:11:06.475 --> 01:11:07.601
What is your problem?

01:11:07.643 --> 01:11:09.770
I told you to hang up Aunt Ruby's phone.

01:11:09.812 --> 01:11:12.231
I'll shove it so far down your throat...

01:11:12.314 --> 01:11:14.983
all you gonna be able to do
is dial 911 with your navel.

01:11:15.025 --> 01:11:16.235
Do you hear me?

01:11:16.318 --> 01:11:18.028
Get the hell in the house
and hang up the phone!

01:11:18.111 --> 01:11:19.613
Put it on the hook.

01:11:26.203 --> 01:11:29.122
Gotta be patient with
these babies, you know?

01:11:31.333 --> 01:11:33.293
Is that Victoria?

01:11:36.088 --> 01:11:38.131
Lord have mercy.

01:11:38.173 --> 01:11:41.176
Who wears heels to a family reunion?

01:11:42.302 --> 01:11:43.512
Hello.

01:11:43.595 --> 01:11:46.223
Hello, ladies.

01:11:46.306 --> 01:11:48.142
It's warm out today, isn't it?

01:11:48.183 --> 01:11:51.520
Be cooler if you had
on some regular clothes.

01:11:52.521 --> 01:11:54.857
That's a nice dress, Victoria.

01:11:54.940 --> 01:11:56.191
Thank you.

01:11:56.275 --> 01:11:58.318
It's kind of haute, isn't it?

01:12:00.904 --> 01:12:02.489
It's all the rave in Paris.

01:12:02.573 --> 01:12:05.159
Well, this is hot Georgier.

01:12:05.242 --> 01:12:06.869
It is not Paree...

01:12:06.952 --> 01:12:09.705
so we don't wear dressie like that.

01:12:09.788 --> 01:12:10.789
You look silly.

01:12:13.083 --> 01:12:16.044
Trying to be so bougie,
oui-oui, pee-pee.

01:12:17.296 --> 01:12:18.547
Where is everyone?

01:12:21.884 --> 01:12:24.011
She's going to need some deodorie.

01:12:27.890 --> 01:12:29.516
For her bootie!

01:12:34.563 --> 01:12:36.398
Girl, I already told them,
"I'm not going down..."

01:12:36.440 --> 01:12:38.484
Good Lord. Who they kin to?

01:12:39.568 --> 01:12:40.527
Who them is?

01:12:40.569 --> 01:12:43.238
That's Henry Lee's daughter.

01:12:43.322 --> 01:12:44.990
That's Henry Lee little girl?

01:12:45.073 --> 01:12:47.993
She got her daddy face,
but her mama everything...

01:12:48.076 --> 01:12:49.495
Hey, hey, wait. Come here, baby.

01:12:50.537 --> 01:12:51.830
Come to Uncle Joe.

01:12:51.914 --> 01:12:53.248
How you doing, baby?

01:12:54.333 --> 01:12:55.375
Listen, I'm a little thirsty.

01:12:55.459 --> 01:12:57.836
Reach down in that
barrel, and get me a drink.

01:12:58.420 --> 01:13:01.715
But lookit, I need it
cold, 'cause I'm parched...

01:13:01.757 --> 01:13:03.550
so reach down deep in the bottom.

01:13:06.386 --> 01:13:08.889
Good Lord almighty.

01:13:14.478 --> 01:13:16.063
Deep, baby, deeper...

01:13:21.443 --> 01:13:22.778
Thank you so much.

01:13:25.739 --> 01:13:28.033
Grover, you want a drink?

01:13:28.116 --> 01:13:29.076
No.

01:13:30.160 --> 01:13:32.538
Oh, yeah. Me, too.

01:13:32.621 --> 01:13:34.748
Me, too, honey.

01:13:34.790 --> 01:13:36.375
Way down in there.

01:13:44.299 --> 01:13:45.259
They ain't got no more.

01:13:48.971 --> 01:13:50.597
Lord have mercy.

01:13:50.639 --> 01:13:52.766
If I wasn't on that heart medication...

01:13:52.808 --> 01:13:54.726
and didn't have this
blood pressure problem...

01:13:54.810 --> 01:13:56.478
and waiting on the kidney transplant...

01:13:56.520 --> 01:13:58.230
and was on dialysis...

01:13:58.313 --> 01:13:59.982
I might take that Viagra.

01:14:00.065 --> 01:14:02.401
I might go and take a chance with it.

01:14:05.154 --> 01:14:07.114
I got him, I got him.

01:14:07.156 --> 01:14:08.157
Back door. Beat him up.

01:14:08.782 --> 01:14:09.700
Ball up!

01:14:09.783 --> 01:14:11.160
Get over there.

01:14:11.243 --> 01:14:12.619
Watch the switch.

01:14:20.502 --> 01:14:21.628
Good game, man.

01:14:22.337 --> 01:14:23.964
Nice time. Very good.

01:14:26.800 --> 01:14:27.926
I got next up.

01:14:28.010 --> 01:14:30.304
You got to let me rest, man. I'm tired.

01:14:30.345 --> 01:14:31.805
Don't tell me you're getting old.

01:14:31.847 --> 01:14:33.265
I ain't gonna tell you, then.

01:14:33.348 --> 01:14:34.558
I'm gonna get some food.

01:14:40.063 --> 01:14:41.148
How's Deborah doing?

01:14:42.024 --> 01:14:43.567
She's good. She's in the house.

01:14:43.650 --> 01:14:44.610
Is she?

01:14:45.360 --> 01:14:47.070
I'm gonna say hi to her.

01:14:47.154 --> 01:14:48.280
You don't want to go in there now.

01:14:48.363 --> 01:14:49.323
The women in there.

01:14:49.364 --> 01:14:52.117
You do not want to go in the kitchen.

01:14:55.329 --> 01:14:57.206
Oh, my goodness.

01:14:57.289 --> 01:15:00.459
Baby, we were just talking about you.

01:15:00.542 --> 01:15:02.294
It's good to see you, baby.

01:15:02.377 --> 01:15:03.712
How are you?

01:15:03.795 --> 01:15:06.882
I'm good. I haven't seen
this side of my family...

01:15:06.965 --> 01:15:08.509
in a long time, though.

01:15:08.592 --> 01:15:10.886
I feel so much love here.

01:15:10.969 --> 01:15:13.514
Whenever you come around family...

01:15:13.597 --> 01:15:15.015
you can find love.

01:15:15.057 --> 01:15:16.558
You can sense it.

01:15:17.893 --> 01:15:21.104
And a bride-to-be will
wear it as a garment.

01:15:21.188 --> 01:15:23.315
Oh, yes, darling.

01:15:23.398 --> 01:15:25.234
And what about your garment?

01:15:25.275 --> 01:15:26.652
Where is it?

01:15:28.237 --> 01:15:30.364
I'm sorry. I don't understand...

01:15:32.699 --> 01:15:35.077
I guess my question really is...

01:15:35.160 --> 01:15:38.997
when are we going to get
to meet this mystery man?

01:15:39.081 --> 01:15:40.207
Indeed.

01:15:40.290 --> 01:15:42.042
He'll be here soon.

01:15:42.084 --> 01:15:44.419
And I'm sure you're
all going to love him.

01:15:50.217 --> 01:15:52.970
You all should be so happy for her.

01:15:53.053 --> 01:15:54.263
Yes, of course.

01:15:54.346 --> 01:15:56.890
Of course, and we want
to be happy for her...

01:15:56.932 --> 01:16:00.477
except that the jury
is still out on that.

01:16:01.436 --> 01:16:03.689
I mean, tell me, baby...

01:16:04.439 --> 01:16:07.568
are you really ready to marry this man?

01:16:09.278 --> 01:16:10.571
I've thought about it.

01:16:10.612 --> 01:16:12.197
Of course she is.

01:16:14.116 --> 01:16:15.075
She loves him.

01:16:17.953 --> 01:16:19.163
She loves him.

01:16:21.957 --> 01:16:23.959
That's a very important factor...

01:16:24.793 --> 01:16:26.670
and I can tell you about love.

01:16:27.963 --> 01:16:29.006
William...

01:16:29.089 --> 01:16:31.967
that's my husband's name...

01:16:33.135 --> 01:16:35.929
we had a love so strong...

01:16:35.971 --> 01:16:39.308
that it just seemed like we were one.

01:16:40.809 --> 01:16:43.353
I would get ready to
tell him something...

01:16:43.437 --> 01:16:46.940
and he would open his mouth
and say the very thing...

01:16:47.024 --> 01:16:48.692
that I was fixing to tell him.

01:16:48.775 --> 01:16:51.487
You know how frustrating
that was sometimes?

01:16:51.528 --> 01:16:53.530
Oh, Lord, I couldn't stand it.

01:16:54.781 --> 01:16:55.782
And then...

01:16:57.159 --> 01:17:00.287
there were those moments
when I would just...

01:17:01.872 --> 01:17:03.832
lay my head on his chest...

01:17:05.083 --> 01:17:07.461
just to listen to his heart beat.

01:17:09.004 --> 01:17:10.506
And then one night...

01:17:10.589 --> 01:17:15.636
I realized that his
heartbeat matched mine.

01:17:15.719 --> 01:17:18.889
Lord have mercy.

01:17:18.972 --> 01:17:22.434
Rhythm's off, now he's gone.

01:17:22.518 --> 01:17:25.187
I'm so sorry, Aunt Myrtle.

01:17:25.229 --> 01:17:26.939
Oh, don't fret for me, sweetheart.

01:17:28.982 --> 01:17:30.776
I have had an opportunity...

01:17:30.859 --> 01:17:33.195
that few people ever get on this earth.

01:17:34.196 --> 01:17:39.910
God has blessed me to share
time and space with a man...

01:17:39.993 --> 01:17:44.081
that he designed himself just for me.

01:17:46.375 --> 01:17:48.710
I've not only been blessed...

01:17:48.794 --> 01:17:52.339
I have been divinely favored.

01:17:52.422 --> 01:17:53.715
It's so true.

01:17:54.925 --> 01:17:59.513
You know, Myrtle, I weep
for these young women today.

01:18:00.931 --> 01:18:04.768
Some of them will never know that.

01:18:05.561 --> 01:18:08.730
In fact, never know even a portion...

01:18:08.814 --> 01:18:10.566
of what you're talking about.

01:18:12.568 --> 01:18:16.572
Darlings, love is many things.

01:18:16.655 --> 01:18:18.115
It's varied.

01:18:19.575 --> 01:18:22.828
One thing it is not and can never be...

01:18:22.911 --> 01:18:24.079
is unsure.

01:18:29.251 --> 01:18:31.170
Take me outside.

01:18:31.253 --> 01:18:33.255
I want to be with my family.

01:18:33.338 --> 01:18:34.464
Oh, Ruby.

01:18:57.529 --> 01:18:59.490
Almost hit it.

01:18:59.573 --> 01:19:00.699
You must be Carlos.

01:19:00.782 --> 01:19:01.909
Is it that obvious?

01:19:01.950 --> 01:19:03.202
Yeah, a little bit.

01:19:03.285 --> 01:19:05.120
I'm Brian, Lisa's cousin. How you doing?

01:19:05.204 --> 01:19:07.206
Come on, I'll introduce
you to everybody.

01:19:49.915 --> 01:19:51.959
So pleased you were able to join us.

01:19:52.042 --> 01:19:54.002
I want you to meet Mabel.

01:19:54.670 --> 01:19:55.629
And Calvin.

01:19:55.671 --> 01:19:56.797
How you doing?

01:19:56.839 --> 01:19:59.007
This is Carlos, Lisa's fiance.

01:20:03.345 --> 01:20:04.638
I'm Frankie.

01:20:04.680 --> 01:20:06.014
I know who you are.

01:20:06.056 --> 01:20:08.851
Mom, I was hoping that we
could talk for a minute.

01:20:08.892 --> 01:20:10.310
I can't talk to you now.

01:20:10.352 --> 01:20:12.146
I'm talking to your sister
about something more important.

01:20:15.274 --> 01:20:18.277
I want you to take Carlos
around and introduce him...

01:20:18.360 --> 01:20:19.695
make him feel more comfortable.

01:20:19.736 --> 01:20:20.696
We're talking.

01:20:20.737 --> 01:20:22.322
And be happy about it.

01:20:22.364 --> 01:20:24.116
How can she be happy about it?

01:20:24.199 --> 01:20:26.201
What would you know about being happy...

01:20:26.285 --> 01:20:27.953
coming in here with some bus driver?

01:20:28.036 --> 01:20:29.705
Can you not do this right now?

01:20:29.746 --> 01:20:31.373
I'm tired of her in your ear...

01:20:31.456 --> 01:20:33.625
about to ruin the best thing
that ever happened to you.

01:20:33.709 --> 01:20:35.752
Don't you mean the best thing
that ever happened to you?

01:20:35.836 --> 01:20:36.795
You can't listen to her...

01:20:36.879 --> 01:20:39.339
'cause she has nothing,
never will have anything...

01:20:39.381 --> 01:20:41.216
and she's jealous of you
because you're so beautiful...

01:20:41.258 --> 01:20:42.759
Jealous?

01:20:42.843 --> 01:20:44.386
You've always been jealous of
our relationship, because...

01:20:44.470 --> 01:20:46.513
You know I've always loved her more.

01:20:46.597 --> 01:20:50.309
You just hate the idea
that anybody might love me.

01:20:50.392 --> 01:20:52.644
If that man loves you, he's a damn fool!

01:20:52.728 --> 01:20:54.354
You are such a bitch.

01:21:00.194 --> 01:21:02.613
Stop that fighting, I say!

01:21:02.696 --> 01:21:05.115
"Girls Gone Wild, Senior Edition."

01:21:08.118 --> 01:21:09.411
Stop that fighting!

01:21:09.453 --> 01:21:11.330
I don't know where you came from!

01:21:11.413 --> 01:21:13.749
You are so damn evil!

01:21:13.832 --> 01:21:15.918
I am my mother's daughter!

01:21:26.428 --> 01:21:29.890
Pray on

01:21:29.973 --> 01:21:34.895
Just a little while longer

01:21:35.646 --> 01:21:38.982
Pray on

01:21:39.066 --> 01:21:42.653
Just a little while

01:21:42.736 --> 01:21:45.239
Longer

01:21:45.322 --> 01:21:48.992
Pray on

01:21:49.076 --> 01:21:54.540
Just a little while longer

01:21:54.623 --> 01:21:59.253
And everything, yes

01:21:59.336 --> 01:22:03.507
Is gonna be all right

01:22:33.620 --> 01:22:36.999
Is this what we paid for?

01:22:38.667 --> 01:22:40.878
What is she talking about?

01:22:40.961 --> 01:22:43.172
I'll tell you what she's talking about.

01:22:45.132 --> 01:22:48.510
This is the first family reunion...

01:22:48.594 --> 01:22:52.139
we have had in five years.

01:22:54.183 --> 01:22:56.059
Aunt Ruby...

01:22:56.143 --> 01:22:59.396
she's ninety-six years old.

01:23:00.856 --> 01:23:03.442
Ninety-six.

01:23:05.444 --> 01:23:08.030
Family reunions...

01:23:08.113 --> 01:23:12.493
are about uniting the family...

01:23:12.534 --> 01:23:16.413
bringing together the young and the old.

01:23:18.707 --> 01:23:20.334
Singing and dancing...

01:23:20.375 --> 01:23:22.961
and thanking God, giving him the glory.

01:23:23.712 --> 01:23:26.590
Thanking him for getting us over.

01:23:28.425 --> 01:23:32.179
As we marched up the road...

01:23:32.221 --> 01:23:33.847
this afternoon...

01:23:35.224 --> 01:23:38.852
what we saw were young men gambling...

01:23:38.936 --> 01:23:40.854
fighting, cussing...

01:23:43.065 --> 01:23:45.609
women with no clothes on...

01:23:45.692 --> 01:23:48.403
gyrating all over on this land.

01:23:51.573 --> 01:23:53.075
Do you see this shack?

01:23:54.910 --> 01:23:57.955
The man and woman who were born here...

01:23:58.038 --> 01:24:01.041
gave birth to this generation.

01:24:01.124 --> 01:24:03.585
They were slaves.

01:24:03.627 --> 01:24:05.712
They worked this ground...

01:24:06.380 --> 01:24:08.173
but they bought it...

01:24:09.925 --> 01:24:12.469
from the widow of the slave owner...

01:24:12.553 --> 01:24:14.972
and that's the kind of blood we have...

01:24:15.055 --> 01:24:16.515
running through our veins.

01:24:16.598 --> 01:24:19.726
That's the stock that we are made of.

01:24:19.810 --> 01:24:21.019
What happened to us?

01:24:23.647 --> 01:24:24.898
Who are you?

01:24:24.940 --> 01:24:26.817
Do you know who you are?

01:24:26.900 --> 01:24:29.903
What happened to the
pride and the dignity...

01:24:29.987 --> 01:24:33.782
and the love and respect
that we had for one another?

01:24:36.410 --> 01:24:38.036
Where did it go?

01:24:39.496 --> 01:24:40.831
And how...

01:24:42.457 --> 01:24:43.667
How do we get it back?

01:24:46.461 --> 01:24:47.546
I'm 'a tell you.

01:24:48.755 --> 01:24:51.633
Young black men, take your place.

01:24:52.801 --> 01:24:54.219
We need you!

01:24:54.303 --> 01:24:58.432
Your sons and daughters need you.

01:24:58.474 --> 01:25:00.392
Did you understand what I just said?

01:25:00.476 --> 01:25:03.395
You were sold off and
had no choice, yes...

01:25:03.479 --> 01:25:05.606
but now it's time to stay.

01:25:05.689 --> 01:25:07.524
Take your place!

01:25:08.734 --> 01:25:11.153
Now! Starting now!

01:25:15.157 --> 01:25:16.158
Young black women...

01:25:17.993 --> 01:25:21.330
you are more than your
thighs and your hips.

01:25:21.413 --> 01:25:24.500
You are beautiful, strong, powerful.

01:25:24.583 --> 01:25:26.293
I want more from you!

01:25:27.336 --> 01:25:28.545
Take your place.

01:25:28.629 --> 01:25:32.132
I want every single one of you...

01:25:32.216 --> 01:25:35.010
young man, young woman...

01:25:35.093 --> 01:25:37.888
turn to the next person...

01:25:37.971 --> 01:25:40.682
standing alongside of you.

01:25:40.766 --> 01:25:42.100
Grab them and hug them...

01:25:42.184 --> 01:25:44.019
and tell them that you love 'em.

01:25:45.395 --> 01:25:47.981
Tell them, "If you need
anything, come to me."

01:25:48.065 --> 01:25:50.609
"If you need somebody
to talk to, come to me."

01:25:50.692 --> 01:25:51.944
I love you, girl.

01:25:52.027 --> 01:25:52.986
Thank you, girl.

01:25:53.028 --> 01:25:54.488
"I'll give you the shoulder.

01:25:54.530 --> 01:25:56.406
"I'll give you the hug.

01:25:56.490 --> 01:25:58.492
"I'll feed you, I'll clothe you

01:25:58.534 --> 01:26:00.327
"if you need it."

01:26:00.369 --> 01:26:02.204
That's how you start...

01:26:02.246 --> 01:26:03.497
from this moment.

01:26:04.706 --> 01:26:07.709
When you leave this reunion today...

01:26:08.710 --> 01:26:10.295
you take that with you.

01:26:10.921 --> 01:26:12.256
God bless y'all.

01:26:12.339 --> 01:26:13.465
God bless you.

01:26:13.549 --> 01:26:14.508
God bless you, Grandma.

01:27:58.237 --> 01:27:59.655
Vanessa just went to
church looking for you.

01:27:59.696 --> 01:28:00.948
What you doing here?

01:28:00.989 --> 01:28:03.283
You two look lovely.

01:28:03.325 --> 01:28:06.328
Looking like a big ol' pig
wrapped in a purple blanket...

01:28:06.370 --> 01:28:07.329
what you look like.

01:28:07.371 --> 01:28:09.248
Shut up and put your shoes on.

01:28:09.331 --> 01:28:11.542
Help that thing find his shoes
so we can get out of here.

01:28:15.045 --> 01:28:16.171
You all right?

01:28:23.762 --> 01:28:24.888
Who is it?

01:28:28.517 --> 01:28:30.310
You running from him?

01:28:32.855 --> 01:28:35.023
It's time to stop
running, honey, and fight.

01:28:39.570 --> 01:28:40.821
Come in.

01:28:53.750 --> 01:28:55.335
Madea, you look lovely.

01:28:57.087 --> 01:28:58.547
You ready for my wedding?

01:28:58.630 --> 01:29:00.048
I only go to church for two reasons...

01:29:00.132 --> 01:29:01.633
weddings and funerals.

01:29:01.717 --> 01:29:03.552
Wonder what I'm dressed for today.

01:29:06.638 --> 01:29:08.182
Don't you know it's bad luck...

01:29:08.265 --> 01:29:10.225
for the groom to see the
bride before the wedding?

01:29:11.393 --> 01:29:13.562
In your case, it might be real bad luck.

01:29:14.563 --> 01:29:16.356
You know I couldn't
resist the love of my life.

01:29:16.398 --> 01:29:18.108
You know she tried to sneak
away from me last night?

01:29:18.192 --> 01:29:19.193
She did, Madea.

01:29:20.152 --> 01:29:22.571
Can we just have a moment alone?

01:29:23.363 --> 01:29:25.741
In my house? Hell, no.

01:29:25.824 --> 01:29:27.367
It's OK, Madea.

01:29:27.451 --> 01:29:29.578
It's OK, just go.

01:29:35.292 --> 01:29:37.294
Carlos, you look like you're hungry.

01:29:40.589 --> 01:29:42.591
I got some hot grits
over there on the stove.

01:29:43.926 --> 01:29:46.512
Lisa, why don't you give Carlos some?

01:29:47.930 --> 01:29:49.389
They hot.

01:29:54.770 --> 01:29:56.939
Yeah, Carlos, you casket sharp.

01:29:59.358 --> 01:30:00.567
Come on, y'all, let's go.

01:30:13.622 --> 01:30:14.706
You must be out your mind.

01:30:14.790 --> 01:30:16.291
You got me all over this
city, walking around.

01:30:16.375 --> 01:30:18.418
Y'all didn't even see where...

01:30:27.302 --> 01:30:28.929
Is everything all right?

01:30:28.971 --> 01:30:31.098
It's fine. I'd know
that scream anywhere.

01:30:31.140 --> 01:30:33.058
Come on, let's go to the church.

01:30:33.142 --> 01:30:35.769
Praise the Lord. God is good.

01:30:35.853 --> 01:30:37.187
She in there playing grit ball.

01:31:23.859 --> 01:31:25.486
This place is nice.

01:31:26.904 --> 01:31:28.363
Hey, all these bougie people.

01:31:28.447 --> 01:31:30.157
- Hello.
- Hi.

01:31:32.201 --> 01:31:35.037
I don't like no stuck-up
people like this.

01:31:35.078 --> 01:31:36.371
When are we going to be able to go in?

01:31:36.413 --> 01:31:37.915
That's what I want to know.

01:31:37.998 --> 01:31:40.459
Where is she? She's late?

01:31:40.542 --> 01:31:42.002
Oh, my God. Excuse me.

01:31:42.085 --> 01:31:43.921
Excuse me. Calm down, everybody!

01:31:44.004 --> 01:31:45.380
We're about to begin.

01:31:45.422 --> 01:31:47.007
We're about to begin.

01:31:47.049 --> 01:31:49.134
Hey, sweet thing. Don't I know you?

01:31:49.218 --> 01:31:52.054
Excuse me? As if you could.

01:31:52.095 --> 01:31:54.014
Now move, old man. Step aside.

01:31:54.056 --> 01:31:56.433
Did that thang just push you, Joe?

01:31:56.517 --> 01:31:57.518
Yeah, she did. She don't know us.

01:31:57.559 --> 01:31:59.353
We're Baptists. We'll
tear this church up.

01:32:00.521 --> 01:32:02.397
You don't know me. I
will set it off in here.

01:32:02.439 --> 01:32:04.441
I will do a drive-by in this church.

01:32:04.525 --> 01:32:05.859
You better be glad you're at church.

01:32:05.901 --> 01:32:08.570
Jesus just saved your
life. Hallelu-yer.

01:32:08.654 --> 01:32:09.822
OK, listen now.

01:32:09.905 --> 01:32:12.241
You old people getting on my nerves now.

01:32:12.324 --> 01:32:15.994
I'm trying to make this event
as professional as possible.

01:32:17.204 --> 01:32:19.206
That's why I can hardly
work with black people now...

01:32:20.582 --> 01:32:22.584
always late and ignorant.

01:32:22.626 --> 01:32:24.378
Y'all better tell
someone. She don't know me.

01:32:24.419 --> 01:32:26.922
She don't know me. She
don't know I'm a thug.

01:32:27.005 --> 01:32:29.216
I'm a real thug. I shot Tupac.

01:32:29.258 --> 01:32:30.759
I did, the first time.

01:32:30.801 --> 01:32:32.094
We was arguing over a parking spot.

01:32:32.177 --> 01:32:33.846
I didn't kill him
though. That wasn't me.

01:32:35.139 --> 01:32:37.766
Just a minute. Where are your dresses?

01:32:37.850 --> 01:32:39.893
What is the problem?

01:32:45.107 --> 01:32:46.859
Not quite what you expected.

01:32:50.028 --> 01:32:51.989
I'm not getting married today.

01:32:59.663 --> 01:33:04.877
I've been beaten every
day since we got engaged.

01:33:12.217 --> 01:33:15.596
And I've tried to
make excuses for him...

01:33:15.637 --> 01:33:17.639
over and over and over again.

01:33:20.434 --> 01:33:25.981
But it's time for me to start
making my own decisions...

01:33:27.357 --> 01:33:30.319
and live for Lisa.

01:33:36.158 --> 01:33:37.659
That's right.

01:33:40.954 --> 01:33:43.916
I feel sorry for you.
One day you'll see.

01:33:43.999 --> 01:33:47.127
Ah, Victoria, shut up!
We feel sorry for you.

01:33:48.212 --> 01:33:50.005
That child got her own life to live.

01:33:50.047 --> 01:33:52.508
You need to go get one and
stop trying to live hers.

01:33:52.549 --> 01:33:58.138
I just hate that all my
hard work has gone to waste.

01:33:58.222 --> 01:33:59.306
It doesn't have to.

01:34:09.399 --> 01:34:10.567
What are you doing?

01:34:15.239 --> 01:34:16.782
Do you love me?

01:34:23.038 --> 01:34:24.039
I love you.

01:34:25.249 --> 01:34:26.291
Prove it.

01:34:27.459 --> 01:34:28.877
Marry me.

01:34:28.961 --> 01:34:33.298
You want me to marry you?

01:34:34.049 --> 01:34:36.260
Right now. Right here.

01:34:46.353 --> 01:34:47.396
All right, all right.

01:34:47.479 --> 01:34:49.815
Get them to the holding area.

01:34:49.898 --> 01:34:51.567
Get a tux on him.

01:34:51.650 --> 01:34:53.193
Go, move, people!

01:34:54.319 --> 01:34:56.113
Come back over here, people.

01:34:56.196 --> 01:34:58.782
There will be a wedding here today.

01:34:58.866 --> 01:35:00.742
All is not lost.

01:35:00.826 --> 01:35:02.202
Ladies and gentlemen...

01:35:03.078 --> 01:35:04.663
I give you...

01:35:05.581 --> 01:35:08.750
Paris in springtime.

01:35:22.264 --> 01:35:23.891
Come right in.

01:35:27.102 --> 01:35:28.896
This is so gorgeous.

01:35:41.450 --> 01:35:45.579
The sun has come. The mists have gone.

01:35:45.621 --> 01:35:48.749
We see in the distance
our long way home.

01:35:50.167 --> 01:35:53.253
I was always yours to have.

01:35:53.295 --> 01:35:54.922
You were always mine.

01:35:55.923 --> 01:35:57.716
We have loved each other...

01:35:57.800 --> 01:35:59.510
in and out of time.

01:36:00.928 --> 01:36:03.222
When the first stone...

01:36:03.305 --> 01:36:06.016
Iooked up at the blazing sun...

01:36:06.099 --> 01:36:08.727
and the first tree struggled up...

01:36:08.811 --> 01:36:10.437
from the forest floor...

01:36:11.438 --> 01:36:14.858
I had always loved you more.

01:36:14.942 --> 01:36:21.114
You freed your braids, gave
your hair to the breeze.

01:36:21.156 --> 01:36:24.076
It hummed like a hive of honeybees.

01:36:24.159 --> 01:36:29.748
I reached in the mass for
the sweet honeycomb there.

01:36:30.833 --> 01:36:32.835
God, how I loved your hair.

01:36:33.836 --> 01:36:38.090
You saw me bludgeoned by circumstance...

01:36:38.173 --> 01:36:42.010
Iost, injured, hurt by chance.

01:36:43.595 --> 01:36:47.516
I screamed to the heavens...

01:36:47.599 --> 01:36:49.643
Ioudly screamed...

01:36:51.019 --> 01:36:54.648
trying to change our
nightmares into dreams.

01:36:54.731 --> 01:36:58.902
The sun has come. The mists have gone.

01:36:58.986 --> 01:37:02.698
We see in the distance
our long way home.

01:37:02.781 --> 01:37:04.908
I was yours to have...

01:37:04.992 --> 01:37:07.744
and you were always mine.

01:37:07.828 --> 01:37:10.497
We loved each other in and out...

01:37:10.581 --> 01:37:14.918
in and out, in and out of time.

01:37:33.061 --> 01:37:36.315
It seems like forever

01:37:36.398 --> 01:37:40.569
That I have waited for you

01:37:40.652 --> 01:37:45.115
In a world of disappointment

01:37:45.199 --> 01:37:47.993
One thing is true

01:37:49.786 --> 01:37:52.289
God has blessed me

01:37:53.582 --> 01:37:57.503
And he's blessed you, too

01:37:57.586 --> 01:38:01.632
In a world of lonely people

01:38:01.715 --> 01:38:04.218
I found you

01:38:05.093 --> 01:38:09.139
Just take my hand

01:38:09.223 --> 01:38:12.100
And hold me close

01:38:13.727 --> 01:38:17.147
And don't

01:38:17.231 --> 01:38:22.110
Let me go

01:38:22.152 --> 01:38:25.113
You for me

01:38:25.197 --> 01:38:29.785
And me for you

01:38:29.868 --> 01:38:32.454
Together we'll make

01:38:32.538 --> 01:38:37.918
One

01:38:37.960 --> 01:38:41.588
We were once strangers

01:38:41.630 --> 01:38:44.341
All by ourselves

01:38:46.510 --> 01:38:48.887
Living, living alone

01:38:48.971 --> 01:38:52.349
With no one else

01:38:54.434 --> 01:38:56.770
But here you are

01:38:58.147 --> 01:39:01.525
And it's so, so sweet

01:39:02.317 --> 01:39:03.277
God must have done this

01:39:03.318 --> 01:39:04.444
Frankie.

01:39:05.404 --> 01:39:08.907
Made you for me

01:39:08.991 --> 01:39:10.284
Today, this is special.

01:39:10.325 --> 01:39:12.536
I was prepared to speak
for Lisa and Carlos...

01:39:12.619 --> 01:39:14.830
but since I'm a little ill-prepared...

01:39:14.913 --> 01:39:18.000
maybe you should just
say what's on your heart.

01:39:28.051 --> 01:39:29.136
I never...

01:39:30.554 --> 01:39:32.890
thought that I could
meet someone like you.

01:39:34.349 --> 01:39:36.351
You are my friend...

01:39:38.687 --> 01:39:40.731
you are my smile...

01:39:42.524 --> 01:39:44.735
you are my everything.

01:39:48.572 --> 01:39:51.033
You are a breath-taking reflection...

01:39:51.116 --> 01:39:53.535
of God's heart for me...

01:39:54.703 --> 01:39:56.872
of how he pursued me...

01:39:56.955 --> 01:39:58.665
and loved me...

01:40:00.834 --> 01:40:03.420
even when I didn't love myself.

01:40:06.048 --> 01:40:07.883
You held my hand in the darkness...

01:40:09.510 --> 01:40:12.012
and you pulled me out into the light.

01:40:16.391 --> 01:40:19.978
I love you, Frankie Henderson.

01:40:20.062 --> 01:40:21.730
You are my light...

01:40:25.651 --> 01:40:28.070
and it doesn't matter what happens...

01:40:28.153 --> 01:40:30.322
in this life...

01:40:32.074 --> 01:40:33.992
as long as you're with me.

01:40:36.537 --> 01:40:38.497
When I look at you...

01:40:43.127 --> 01:40:44.670
I know that there's a God...

01:40:50.467 --> 01:40:53.220
and that he loved me so much...

01:40:54.680 --> 01:40:57.099
that he took the time to create you...

01:41:00.269 --> 01:41:01.311
just for me.

01:41:04.940 --> 01:41:06.817
I love you...

01:41:08.735 --> 01:41:10.279
past my mind...

01:41:10.362 --> 01:41:12.406
beyond my heart.

01:41:15.701 --> 01:41:17.494
I love you for my soul...

01:41:22.458 --> 01:41:24.209
and that's the space...

01:41:24.293 --> 01:41:27.254
where only you and God dwell.

01:41:30.132 --> 01:41:31.633
After that...

01:41:31.717 --> 01:41:34.553
there is nothing to say.

01:41:34.636 --> 01:41:36.221
Kiss your bride.

01:42:17.304 --> 01:42:19.389
You really are a beautiful couple.

01:42:23.310 --> 01:42:24.353
Really beautiful.

01:43:39.344 --> 01:43:40.345
Yeah, you're on the mark.

01:43:46.602 --> 01:43:47.769
You must be Carlos, man.

01:43:47.853 --> 01:43:49.021
- Yes.
- How you doin'?

01:43:49.104 --> 01:43:51.064
- I'm good.
- Good to meet you.

01:43:51.106 --> 01:43:52.524
Is it that obvious?

01:43:52.608 --> 01:43:53.734
What, that you're Carlos?

01:43:53.817 --> 01:43:55.068
- I'm Carlos.
- Yeah, it is.

01:43:55.110 --> 01:43:56.778
- I'm Carlos.
- I can tell.

01:43:56.862 --> 01:43:58.780
Maybe we can get this take again.

01:43:58.822 --> 01:44:00.491
- Yeah.
- Ok. All right.

01:44:04.286 --> 01:44:06.663
And, action.

01:44:09.583 --> 01:44:11.460
Excuse me.

01:44:11.502 --> 01:44:14.671
I'm a little old. I can't hold it.

01:44:14.755 --> 01:44:16.590
That's OK.

01:44:24.348 --> 01:44:26.767
They tell me you're gonna
take her out somewhere.

01:44:26.809 --> 01:44:28.435
Yep. I'm gonna take her out.

01:44:28.477 --> 01:44:30.103
Oh. Where you goin'?

01:44:30.145 --> 01:44:32.105
Just this place around the corner.

01:44:32.147 --> 01:44:34.066
It's a nice Italian place.

01:44:34.149 --> 01:44:36.985
That ain't where you goin'.
You're going to a poetry bar.

01:44:37.027 --> 01:44:39.029
That's true. We're
going to a poetry bar.

01:44:39.112 --> 01:44:41.114
- Let's start over.
- Ok.

01:44:42.950 --> 01:44:45.327
Read the script next time.

01:44:48.080 --> 01:44:49.414
Excuse me. Excuse me.

01:45:09.268 --> 01:45:10.435
I don't even know where you at.

01:45:14.523 --> 01:45:15.607
Am I loose enough?

01:45:27.035 --> 01:45:29.454
The year is 2045...

01:45:29.538 --> 01:45:31.790
and I am Michael Jackson...

01:45:31.874 --> 01:45:34.626
and we're on tour with my brothers.

01:45:34.710 --> 01:45:37.045
Here's my brother, Jermaine.

01:45:37.880 --> 01:45:40.174
Do you remember him?

01:45:40.215 --> 01:45:42.217
This is my brother Tito.

01:45:42.301 --> 01:45:45.971
And you gotta remember little Janet.

01:45:48.390 --> 01:45:50.350
Ya'll still here at
the movies? It's over.

01:45:51.310 --> 01:45:53.854
You can go home now. You enjoy yourself?

01:45:55.230 --> 01:45:56.356
Lord have mercy.

01:45:56.398 --> 01:45:58.442
Honey, don't bring your
baby to the movie no more.

01:45:58.525 --> 01:45:59.568
That is rude as hell.

01:45:59.651 --> 01:46:01.695
People trying to watch
this movie and you bring...

01:46:01.737 --> 01:46:04.573
that crying child in here
through the whole movie.

01:46:04.656 --> 01:46:06.200
What is your problem? I hate that.

01:46:07.409 --> 01:46:09.411
Why they sell popcorn
at a movie theater?

01:46:09.495 --> 01:46:11.413
That is the loudest food you can have.

01:46:11.455 --> 01:46:12.831
Why don't ya'll get something else?

01:46:12.915 --> 01:46:15.876
Get something that don't cause no noise.

01:46:17.294 --> 01:46:18.796
And look at Junebug back in the back...

01:46:18.879 --> 01:46:20.547
with a video camera
trying to bootleg it.

01:46:20.589 --> 01:46:22.591
You know they waiting
on to get something.

01:46:22.674 --> 01:46:24.384
You see her over there?

01:46:24.468 --> 01:46:26.678
You see her?

01:46:28.764 --> 01:46:30.140
That dress is too small.

01:46:32.059 --> 01:46:34.228
Pull your pants up, honey.
Them ain't lowriders.

01:46:36.021 --> 01:46:37.606
Her butt just too big.

01:46:37.689 --> 01:46:39.233
She couldn't get 'em up.

01:46:40.317 --> 01:46:42.319
Lord have mercy. All right, go on.

01:46:42.402 --> 01:46:44.571
The movie over. I'll see you
later. Napisy pobrane z NapisZone
