00:02.953 --> 00:04.223
- Hey.
- Hi.

00:04.255 --> 00:06.468
You okay?

00:06.515 --> 00:08.827
Oh, God. No... Aaron, I'm not.

00:08.860 --> 00:11.296
I feel like I've had
some huge bomb dropped on me.

00:11.328 --> 00:13.828
Oh, shit. I am, uh...

00:13.860 --> 00:14.862
I'm so sorry.

00:14.886 --> 00:16.735
I feel like I'm on the verge of...

00:16.767 --> 00:18.002
of a nervous breakdown.

00:18.036 --> 00:20.072
I've never felt so blindsided.

00:22.106 --> 00:24.509
Look, Zoey, we didn't mean
to hurt you, okay?

00:24.542 --> 00:26.244
It was just... I don't know.

00:26.278 --> 00:27.946
Ana's so cool,
and things just kind of...

00:27.978 --> 00:30.448
they happened, you know?

00:30.481 --> 00:31.749
What are you talking about?

00:31.783 --> 00:33.252
What happened with you and Ana?

00:33.285 --> 00:35.020
Wait. Did Ana not talk to you?

00:35.052 --> 00:37.388
Talk to me about what?

00:39.457 --> 00:40.692
About, um...

00:44.228 --> 00:46.664
Hello? <i> "We</i> didn't mean to hurt you"?

00:46.697 --> 00:47.956
What does that mean?

00:48.019 --> 00:51.836
I just meant we, in general,
like, didn't mean to hurt you...

00:51.869 --> 00:53.271
like that time we clowned you

00:53.304 --> 00:54.542
when you were watching
"MasterChef Junior."

00:54.567 --> 00:56.641
In your defense, Reggie didn't
deserve to be blasted

00:56.675 --> 00:57.769
over a beef kabob... the kid's 8.

00:57.808 --> 01:00.545
Aaron, why are doing that
stupid rambling thing you do

01:00.578 --> 01:01.880
when you're hiding something?

01:01.913 --> 01:03.308
I'm not rambling.
I'm just trying to talk to you

01:03.355 --> 01:05.059
about a great show, "MasterChef Junior."

01:05.084 --> 01:06.660
If I was rambling, I'd talk to
you about O.G. "MasterChef"...

01:06.693 --> 01:09.364
Aaron, stop. What the hell
are you talking about?

01:09.389 --> 01:10.989
- You and Ana?
- Okay. Okay.

01:11.037 --> 01:13.974
Uh, Ana and I...

01:14.035 --> 01:17.240
we, you know, fell into
a little situation,

01:17.295 --> 01:19.431
and we've been kickin' it, so...

01:19.464 --> 01:21.267
"Kickin' it" like how?

01:21.300 --> 01:22.768
Just kickin' it, kickin' it.

01:22.801 --> 01:25.504
Like, really kickin' it hard.

01:25.538 --> 01:28.140
Kickin' it and stuff... naked.

01:28.173 --> 01:29.608
We've been naked together.

01:32.845 --> 01:34.047
Dope.

<i>Since the dawn of womankind,</i>

02:49.130 --> 02:51.967
<i>much about humans
has adapted and evolved.</i>

02:51.999 --> 02:54.103
<i>You know, like how we
used to sleep in caves</i>

02:54.135 --> 02:55.803
<i>or comb our hair with rocks.</i>

02:55.836 --> 02:59.107
<i>However, there is one rule
that has and will always</i>

02:59.140 --> 03:03.211
<i>withstand the test of time... Girl Code.</i>

03:03.245 --> 03:07.950
<i>That unspoken, yet very strict
set of rules we ladies live by.</i>

03:07.983 --> 03:10.952
<i>And the number-one rule
of Girl Code is...</i>

03:10.985 --> 03:13.288
<i>"Don't date anyone your homegirl</i>

03:13.321 --> 03:15.390
<i>has been in a relationship with."</i>

03:15.424 --> 03:17.960
<i>The number-two rule of Girl Code?</i>

03:17.992 --> 03:22.531
<i>Read rule number one
over and over and over again</i>

03:22.563 --> 03:24.567

03:26.168 --> 03:28.069
<i>But what happened to Girl Code</i>

03:28.103 --> 03:31.640
<i>when your generation redefined
traditional relationships</i>

03:31.672 --> 03:34.142
<i>and turned them into
something different?</i>

03:34.176 --> 03:35.678
<i>"Situationships."</i>

03:40.449 --> 03:43.085
<i>Things become a lot less
black and white.</i>

03:43.117 --> 03:45.320
<i>In fact, they can get murky.</i>

03:45.354 --> 03:49.658
<i>And for Ana and me, they were
about to get hella murky.</i>

03:51.092 --> 03:52.760
What the hell are you saying right now?

03:52.794 --> 03:54.730
She's saying she's a snake-ass bitch

03:54.763 --> 03:56.432
with no respect for Girl Code.

03:56.465 --> 03:58.567
But I have hella respect
for her creep game, though.

03:58.599 --> 03:59.867
Right in our faces!

03:59.901 --> 04:01.870
Okay. Creeping, secrets,
that's whatever.

04:01.902 --> 04:04.372
You do realize what you did
to your best friend, right?

04:04.406 --> 04:06.541
Your roommate? Our roommate?

04:06.575 --> 04:08.177
I know.

04:08.210 --> 04:10.346
And that's why I need your help.

04:10.378 --> 04:13.682
Look, Zoey found out before
I had a chance to tell her,

04:13.714 --> 04:16.017
and now she's locked herself
in her room.

04:16.050 --> 04:18.887
She won't come out,
no matter how hard I try.

04:19.519 --> 04:22.725
_

04:24.393 --> 04:26.629
Zoey, you want to talk?

04:26.661 --> 04:27.929
Okay. Cool. No, I gotcha.

04:27.963 --> 04:29.531
Another time. It's fine.

04:29.564 --> 04:31.200
And, believe me,
I'm gonna keep trying, but...

04:31.233 --> 04:32.434
Believe you?

04:32.466 --> 04:33.935
How the hell are we supposed to believe

04:33.968 --> 04:36.471
anything that comes out of
your trifling-ass mouth anymore?

04:36.504 --> 04:39.141
I didn't think it would
get to this point.

04:39.173 --> 04:42.110
Look, it truly started
innocently, and then, it just...

04:42.144 --> 04:44.112
It just snowballed.

04:45.413 --> 04:47.716
I just want this whole mess to be over.

04:47.749 --> 04:49.752
Well, none of the people in
this room have slept with Aaron,

04:49.785 --> 04:51.552
so you need to ovary the hell up,

04:51.586 --> 04:53.288
get in there, and fix this,

04:53.321 --> 04:55.757
because my parents are not
paying this much in rent

04:55.790 --> 04:58.660
for me to be unhappy
in this beautiful apartment.

05:00.429 --> 05:01.597
Bro, you and Ana?

05:01.629 --> 05:02.730
How does that even work,

05:02.764 --> 05:06.067
like, physically,
politically, spiritually?

05:06.100 --> 05:07.603
Was it everything I imagined it was?

05:07.636 --> 05:09.237
Like a Maxwell video?

05:09.271 --> 05:11.773
- Get your boy, man.
- That's... That's your boy, man.

05:11.807 --> 05:13.108
Unfortunately, he's both of our boy.

05:13.141 --> 05:14.777
Aww, that's so sweet.

05:14.809 --> 05:16.511
Bro, look, I'm not even
trying to judge you,

05:16.545 --> 05:19.348
but smashing within the friend
group is straight treacherous.

05:19.381 --> 05:21.116
It's not like I went looking for this.

05:21.148 --> 05:22.584
It just kind of happened.

05:22.617 --> 05:24.586
I wish that stuff
just kind of happened to me...

05:24.619 --> 05:26.588
although, flip-side,
Zoey's probably pissed at you.

05:26.620 --> 05:27.755
Ana's probably pissed at you.

05:27.788 --> 05:29.257
Zoey's definitely pissed at Ana.

05:29.290 --> 05:30.925
I wouldn't have the emotional
bandwidth for that.

05:30.959 --> 05:32.360
I should probably reach out, you know,

05:32.394 --> 05:33.595
hit her up, shoot her a little text.

05:33.627 --> 05:36.598
- No. No.
- No, you can't do that.

05:36.631 --> 05:38.767
- Dude, come on.
- You cannot text her right now.

05:38.800 --> 05:41.937
Big facts. Plus, Ana's probably
in the middle of it.

05:41.970 --> 05:43.839
What? No. I'm talking
about texting Zoey.

05:43.872 --> 05:45.441
Are you a dumbass?

05:45.473 --> 05:47.442
- The hell?
- That shit's got to stop.

05:47.475 --> 05:49.211
Dude, you are sleeping with Ana.

05:49.244 --> 05:50.713
Do you really think
she'd really appreciate you

05:50.745 --> 05:51.980
checking in on Zoey?

05:54.316 --> 05:56.485
You're right.
So, I check on both of them.

05:56.518 --> 05:57.619
Group text.

05:57.651 --> 05:59.288
All the wrong moves, B.

05:59.321 --> 06:01.657
Give me your phone.

06:01.689 --> 06:05.293
Bro, you made a lot
of bad decisions today.

06:05.326 --> 06:06.661
Let me help you make a good one.

06:06.694 --> 06:08.629
- I don't want to.
- Come on.

06:08.663 --> 06:10.966
Come on.

06:10.999 --> 06:12.801
Thank you.

06:12.834 --> 06:15.838
Be right here until you get it together.

06:19.173 --> 06:20.742
Okay.

06:22.177 --> 06:23.812
Fix it now.

06:23.845 --> 06:25.114
Fine.

06:29.785 --> 06:30.986
See? It's no use.

06:31.019 --> 06:32.653
- I'll try tomorrow.
- No. No.

06:34.256 --> 06:35.491
Come in.

06:35.523 --> 06:37.992
- Go.
- Okay!

06:40.028 --> 06:41.696
All right.

06:52.807 --> 06:54.043
Hey.

06:56.877 --> 06:58.146
Hi?

07:01.382 --> 07:04.185
Okay. All right.
So, I guess I'll just, um...

07:04.218 --> 07:05.353
I'll just dive right in.

07:05.386 --> 07:08.456
Um, Zoey, first off...

07:08.490 --> 07:10.593
I'm sorry.

07:13.160 --> 07:14.797
But I need you to know that

07:14.829 --> 07:16.531
I wanted to be the one to tell you.

07:16.564 --> 07:19.033
It's just that, every time
I tried, the time was just...

07:19.067 --> 07:20.802
it just wasn't right.

07:20.836 --> 07:23.872
Whatever. The point is,
you're my best friend.

07:23.905 --> 07:26.842
And... And you should have never
heard it from anyone else.

07:28.410 --> 07:30.312
Please say something.

07:30.345 --> 07:31.612
Anything.

07:36.584 --> 07:41.222
You're a shady piece
of backstabbing trash.

07:41.256 --> 07:43.880
Okay. Um...

07:43.905 --> 07:44.960
Great first step.

07:44.992 --> 07:46.928
You know, a-at least
we're communicating.

07:49.531 --> 07:52.501
Zoey, I... I... You have to believe me.

07:52.533 --> 07:54.836
We never meant to hurt you.

07:54.870 --> 07:57.172
Oh, pause. "We"?

07:57.204 --> 08:00.241
Ugh, a bitch is using plural pronouns!

08:00.274 --> 08:02.644
Okay, I'm gonna need Ana
to take two steps forward,

08:02.677 --> 08:04.480
'cause I'm tired of looking
under homegirl's shorty robe.

08:04.512 --> 08:06.781
<i>When did all of this start happening?</i>

08:06.814 --> 08:09.750
Okay, well, we started hanging
out a little while ago.

08:09.783 --> 08:13.754
Um, and no... nothing happened,
really, just flirting...

08:13.788 --> 08:15.757
w-which I... I stopped.

08:15.790 --> 08:19.027
And then, like, um, a week or so ago,

08:19.059 --> 08:21.596
it, um, turned into more.

08:21.629 --> 08:24.932
Wow. Do you have any idea
how dumb I feel?

08:24.966 --> 08:26.802
You are supposed to be my best friend.

08:26.834 --> 08:28.369
I am.

08:28.402 --> 08:30.137
Best friends don't sleep with
their best friend's ex.

08:30.170 --> 08:33.876
With all due respect, Aaron
technically is not your ex.

08:33.909 --> 08:37.111
Okay. Never trust anyone
who starts a sentence with

08:37.145 --> 08:38.514
"all due respect."

08:38.546 --> 08:42.283
That's right behind, "I have
tons of black friends, but..."

08:42.316 --> 08:43.985
But Ana does have a point.

08:44.018 --> 08:47.121
How Sway? Aaron is totally Zoey's ex.

08:47.155 --> 08:49.790
No. Technically,
they were never together.

08:49.824 --> 08:51.392
Then, technically, what were they?

08:51.425 --> 08:54.028
They were more of a, um, situationship.

08:54.061 --> 08:56.464
Without the official
"relationship" label,

08:56.497 --> 08:58.233
you aren't in an official relationship.

08:58.266 --> 09:00.468
If Aaron and I were never
in a relationship,

09:00.502 --> 09:01.969
then why'd you sneak around?

09:02.002 --> 09:03.805
You knew that we had had
feelings for each other.

09:03.838 --> 09:06.007
You knew that we had hooked up,
that he's been to my house,

09:06.040 --> 09:07.876
that he has met my family.

09:07.909 --> 09:09.177
Matter of fact, you were the one

09:09.209 --> 09:11.012
who told me to choose him over Luca.

09:11.045 --> 09:14.148
Right! And you chose Luca!

09:14.181 --> 09:16.984
Okay, now Zoey is just
straight-up wrong, okay?

09:17.017 --> 09:19.253
Her and Aaron were never
in a relationship.

09:19.286 --> 09:21.656
Remember last year, when she
said she wanted a relationship

09:21.689 --> 09:23.257
like you and Doug?

09:23.290 --> 09:25.160
Everyone wants what we have.

09:25.193 --> 09:26.728
Yeah, including you.

09:28.396 --> 09:30.132
Just 'cause you don't have it anymore.

09:32.032 --> 09:34.335
I mean, with all due respect, of course.

09:34.368 --> 09:37.204
Okay, well, my point is
that Zoey had to choose

09:37.237 --> 09:40.776
between two situationships...
Aaron and Luca...

09:40.809 --> 09:43.211
to decide which relationship
she wanted to be in,

09:43.243 --> 09:45.213
and she chose Luca.

09:45.246 --> 09:47.616
Her and Aaron were a
situationship. Case closed.

09:47.649 --> 09:49.384
Okay, aren't you guys
forgetting about Cash,

09:49.416 --> 09:51.519
who you guys told her to choose?

09:54.322 --> 09:55.724
- I don't recall.
- I don't recall.

09:58.292 --> 10:01.696
What... What do I have to do
to get you to believe me?

10:01.729 --> 10:03.531
I am so sorry.

10:03.564 --> 10:06.034
I know that you are sorry
for hurting my feelings

10:06.066 --> 10:07.702
and for keeping secrets,

10:07.736 --> 10:09.905
but are you sorry for getting
with him in the first place?

10:12.674 --> 10:16.444
Right. Right.
Well, I hope it was worth it.

10:41.949 --> 10:44.772
<i>With Girl Code in all kinds of shambles,</i>

10:44.805 --> 10:46.074
<i>there was only one place</i>

10:46.107 --> 10:48.610
<i>that I thought would
make me feel better.</i>

10:48.642 --> 10:51.579
Oh, my God, dude. Okay.

10:51.612 --> 10:54.915
Do you want to hear the craziest
thing that just happened?

10:54.949 --> 10:56.617
Is it crazier than these lifer dudes

10:56.651 --> 10:59.353
from "Penitentiary Kitchen" that
will make Michelin-star meals

10:59.386 --> 11:01.922
out of Flaming Hot Cheetos
and cigarette lighters

11:01.955 --> 11:04.659
in their cells?

11:04.693 --> 11:06.428
Yeah. It is. Um...

11:06.460 --> 11:10.665
Ana has been hooking up with Aaron.

11:10.699 --> 11:12.300
Oh, yeah.

11:12.333 --> 11:15.771
I knew about that for a while.

11:15.804 --> 11:17.472
Exc... Um...

11:17.505 --> 11:18.839
What... What...

11:18.864 --> 11:21.043
What did you just say to me?

11:21.075 --> 11:22.510
I'm not crazy for thinking

11:22.544 --> 11:24.846
that Aaron isn't Zoey's ex, am I?

11:24.878 --> 11:27.449
If he was, there's no way
I would have messed with him.

11:27.482 --> 11:29.451
She sat on that couch and said to me

11:29.483 --> 11:30.619
that they were never in love.

11:30.644 --> 11:31.886
They never even had sex.

11:31.920 --> 11:34.622
Well, wait, so you have to have
had sex to be off-limits?

11:34.664 --> 11:36.028
- Yes!
- Well, what if they had

11:36.052 --> 11:37.256
an emotional connection?

11:37.257 --> 11:38.694
You know, people can connect

11:38.727 --> 11:40.592
on a deeper, more intellectual level.

11:40.617 --> 11:41.663
Intellectual?

11:41.695 --> 11:43.731
Wait, we are talking about
Aaron and Zoey, right?

11:43.765 --> 11:45.199
Yeah, no, I'm just asking, like,

11:45.233 --> 11:47.069
how far do two people
have to go physically

11:47.102 --> 11:49.304
in order for them to be
considered off-limits?

11:49.337 --> 11:50.572
Dry humping.

11:52.607 --> 11:55.010
What? I said what I said.

11:55.042 --> 11:57.511
Look, it doesn't matter what
level of physical interaction

11:57.545 --> 11:59.046
I've had with a dude from my past.

11:59.079 --> 12:02.184
If he's from my past,
he's completely off-limits.

12:02.217 --> 12:04.519
Even Lil' Rico with the baby
teeth from sixth grade?

12:04.551 --> 12:07.488
Especially Lil' Rico with
the baby teeth from sixth grade.

12:07.521 --> 12:09.156
Unh!

12:09.189 --> 12:10.659
Even with your punk-ass spinnies,

12:10.691 --> 12:12.827
that's a 9-3 lead for The Digital.

12:12.861 --> 12:15.097
Congratulations.
You're great at fake soccer.

12:15.130 --> 12:16.231
"Fake football" to you.

12:16.263 --> 12:17.264
Guys, I got it, all right?

12:17.298 --> 12:18.500
I've decided I'm not gonna text,

12:18.532 --> 12:19.700
but, instead,
go over to Zoey and Ana's...

12:19.733 --> 12:21.103
talk all the drama out in person.

12:21.136 --> 12:22.603
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!
- Man, stop the clock!

12:22.636 --> 12:23.905
You can't go over there right now.

12:23.938 --> 12:25.674
Now, who knows what kind of mess
you'd be walking into?

12:25.707 --> 12:27.609
Could be all sorts of crazy,
you know, screaming,

12:27.641 --> 12:30.344
and... and hair pulling,
and bras everywhere.

12:31.713 --> 12:33.348
Maybe I should go over there
and defuse the situation.

12:33.381 --> 12:35.784
Bro, I... I don't think you
understand the magnitude

12:35.816 --> 12:37.017
of what's going on right now.

12:37.050 --> 12:38.753
You smashed two homegirls.

12:38.786 --> 12:40.021
You're public enemy number one.

12:40.054 --> 12:41.723
I never smashed Zoey.

12:41.756 --> 12:43.257
All right, so, look at this.

12:43.290 --> 12:47.128
How would you feel if one of us
tried to get at Zoey?

12:47.161 --> 12:48.530
Okay. Fine.

12:48.563 --> 12:50.365
Before high school,
any dude's fair game,

12:50.397 --> 12:52.867
'cause, you know, all that
stuff's above the belt, anyways.

12:52.901 --> 12:54.535
But ninth grade and on?

12:54.569 --> 12:55.971
Off. Lim. Its.

12:56.003 --> 12:57.372
Cool, so I can, like,
totally go after Lil' Rico

12:57.405 --> 12:58.406
from sixth grade, right?

12:58.439 --> 12:59.708
Of course...

12:59.741 --> 13:01.710
if you want to get yourself
nice and [bleep] up.

13:01.742 --> 13:03.545
Guys, enough.

13:03.578 --> 13:05.914
I don't want to hear about
physical limitations,

13:05.947 --> 13:07.716
statute of limitations, or Girl Code.

13:07.748 --> 13:09.884
I just want to
make things right with Zoey.

13:09.917 --> 13:12.386
Well, maybe if you did care
about those things,

13:12.420 --> 13:15.156
you'd probably still have
your friendship, Ana.

13:15.189 --> 13:16.624
You don't think I've lost

13:16.657 --> 13:18.659
my friendship with Zoey
over this, do you?

13:18.693 --> 13:21.563
Look, Ana. Lying is a really
hard thing to get over.

13:21.595 --> 13:22.963
But I didn't lie.

13:22.997 --> 13:26.233
I mean, a lie of omission
is still a lie.

13:26.266 --> 13:27.902
I didn't want to lie.

13:27.935 --> 13:30.838
I just didn't know if this was
a fling or if it was real,

13:30.872 --> 13:33.641
and I didn't want to bring
Zoey into it until I knew.

13:33.675 --> 13:35.743
It's the fact that you allowed yourself

13:35.776 --> 13:37.579
to catch feelings in the first place

13:37.612 --> 13:39.247
that poses the problem.

13:39.280 --> 13:42.184
Yeah. I mean, once someone hurts
you and leaves you vulnerable,

13:42.217 --> 13:45.687
it's really hard to
ever trust them again.

13:47.689 --> 13:50.592
Okay. So, you know they were hooking up,

13:50.625 --> 13:52.027
and you kept it from me?

13:52.059 --> 13:53.594
Not my secret to share.

13:53.627 --> 13:55.329
Whoa!

13:55.362 --> 13:57.031
Dude was about to uncork his pruno.

13:57.064 --> 14:01.468
Oh, my goodness. I do not care
about Vato Dan's toilet wine!

14:01.502 --> 14:03.103
There should be no secrets between us...

14:03.136 --> 14:05.607
like when I told you that
I think Bow Wow is a legend.

14:05.640 --> 14:07.209
Like, anything else
you're hiding from me?

14:07.242 --> 14:09.144
You sleeping with Ana, too?

14:09.176 --> 14:10.978
Okay, I know you're
going through something,

14:11.011 --> 14:13.113
so I'm gonna ignore
that extra-ass comment.

14:13.146 --> 14:14.882
It's not extra to feel betrayed

14:14.915 --> 14:18.719
because my best friend
is sleeping with my ex.

14:18.752 --> 14:21.288
Your "ex"?

14:21.322 --> 14:22.457
Dude, you know what I mean.

14:22.489 --> 14:24.725
No. In fact, I don't know what you mean.

14:24.758 --> 14:26.127
And I don't know why it matters

14:26.160 --> 14:28.530
whether or not Ana
is hooking up with Aaron.

14:28.563 --> 14:30.799
Because, at one point,
I had real feelings for him.

14:30.832 --> 14:32.901
Exactly. "At one point."

14:32.934 --> 14:34.636
You're with someone else now.
You're with me.

14:34.669 --> 14:37.239
Yeah, Luca, I know,
but I am allowed to be upset

14:37.271 --> 14:39.241
at the fact that you hid this from me.

14:39.274 --> 14:41.142
I've been made a fool of
by my best friend

14:41.175 --> 14:42.743
and, apparently, my boyfriend.

14:42.776 --> 14:44.812
Seems like it's less about
you feeling like a fool

14:44.845 --> 14:48.082
and more about you still
having feelings for old boy.

14:50.517 --> 14:51.719
Am I right?

14:51.752 --> 14:53.888
No. No. No. No.

14:53.921 --> 14:55.656
God, I...

14:55.689 --> 14:57.725
I mean, I don't know.

14:57.758 --> 14:59.593
I do know. I... I do know.

14:59.627 --> 15:01.529
It's just that everything is... is...

15:01.561 --> 15:03.497
like still so new that I'm in shock,

15:03.531 --> 15:07.334
and it's really confusing,
and I'm still processing it.

15:07.367 --> 15:09.503
Maybe you should find
another place to process it.

15:12.073 --> 15:13.542
Are you kidding me right now?

15:15.376 --> 15:17.178
No, you're not.

15:27.476 --> 15:29.858
<i>Tonight, we take you to Rikers Island.</i>

15:29.883 --> 15:31.733
<i>In this all-inclusive resort,</i>

15:31.758 --> 15:34.946
<i>guests need more protection
than just SPF 15.</i>

15:34.978 --> 15:36.697
Yo, Zoey. What's up?

15:36.731 --> 15:38.300
- Hey.
- Are you looking for Aaron?

15:38.333 --> 15:40.035
- 'Cause he's not here.
- No, I know.

15:40.068 --> 15:41.770
That's why I came by.

15:41.803 --> 15:43.605
Checked my friend tracker.

15:43.637 --> 15:46.608
I have nowhere else to go.

15:46.641 --> 15:50.478
<i>So, my parents had
cut me off, Ana betrayed me,</i>

15:50.511 --> 15:52.213
<i>and Luca had kicked me out</i>

15:52.246 --> 15:55.150
<i>because he believed I still
had feelings for Aaron.</i>

15:57.584 --> 15:59.653
Chips?

15:59.686 --> 16:02.056
- We don't have any salsa.
- No.

16:02.089 --> 16:03.724
<i>I just needed to talk to someone</i>

16:03.757 --> 16:07.228
<i>who had no dog in the race,
no Girl Code,</i>

16:07.261 --> 16:10.966
<i>and, in Vivek's case,
no love life to pull from.</i>

16:12.266 --> 16:14.602
Feels like everyone
just needs time to heal.

16:14.635 --> 16:16.271
- Mm-hmm.
- Yeah, Vivek's right.

16:16.304 --> 16:17.906
You can't just dead a friendship

16:17.939 --> 16:19.607
without thinking about it for a minute.

16:19.640 --> 16:23.278
Yeah, well, thank you guys
for letting me hang out here.

16:23.310 --> 16:25.079
I wasn't quite ready to go home yet.

16:25.112 --> 16:26.580
Oh. Of course.

16:26.613 --> 16:30.417
You do exactly what you need
to do for you right now.

16:30.450 --> 16:32.252
That's how I live my life.

16:32.285 --> 16:34.255
- I'm about to go take a tub.
- Mm.

16:34.287 --> 16:35.656
- Yeah.
- Okay.

16:35.689 --> 16:37.959
Enjoy that bath bomb.

16:39.227 --> 16:41.429
Um, Zoey, you know
you're welcome to stay here

16:41.462 --> 16:42.530
as long as you want.

16:42.563 --> 16:43.765
Thank you.

16:43.798 --> 16:44.866
But what's your guesstimate?

16:44.899 --> 16:47.268
Because this is where V-Dig racks out.

16:47.300 --> 16:49.772
- You sleep here?
- Most nights.

16:49.797 --> 16:51.672
I mean, once they buy me out of yay-yo,

16:51.705 --> 16:55.110
the guys at the Winthrop house don't
really talk to me much, so...

16:55.142 --> 16:56.944
They don't seem like good friends.

16:56.978 --> 16:58.380
They're not.

16:58.412 --> 17:01.149
It's why I like
to hang out here with my boys.

17:01.181 --> 17:02.683
Hm.

17:02.717 --> 17:05.119
You know, Zo,
your girls really love you.

17:05.152 --> 17:08.455
And whether you want to hear it
or not, Ana loves you, too.

17:08.488 --> 17:11.226
At the end of the day,
our girls are all we've got.

17:11.258 --> 17:12.626
Huh?

Zoey.

19:18.119 --> 19:20.789
I'm so sorry this happened.

19:23.356 --> 19:28.930
<i>At that moment, I couldn't get
what Vivek said out of my head.</i>

19:28.962 --> 19:31.266
<i>He was right.</i>

19:31.298 --> 19:33.468
<i>As much drama that was caused,</i>

19:33.500 --> 19:37.372
<i>my girls were the only things
I'd always have.</i>

19:37.404 --> 19:40.541
<i>I mean, isn't that what
Girl Code is about...</i>

19:40.574 --> 19:42.876
<i>protecting each other
and sticking together,</i>

19:42.910 --> 19:44.278
<i>even when it hurts?</i>

19:49.749 --> 19:52.053
I'm sorry, too.

19:52.085 --> 19:55.656
Girl Code says we shouldn't let
a guy get between friends.

19:59.093 --> 20:02.729
But we're not friends anymore.

20:02.763 --> 20:04.666
You're just a girl I live with.

20:16.744 --> 20:18.880
That's another game
of fake soccer for me,

20:18.912 --> 20:21.248
as well as another real
20 bucks from you.

20:21.282 --> 20:22.550
One more, double or nothing.

20:22.583 --> 20:24.151
Dude, I have all your money.

20:24.185 --> 20:25.820
Bro, one more. First goal wins.

20:25.853 --> 20:27.087
Come on.

20:27.121 --> 20:28.323
- Okay.
- Come on.

20:28.355 --> 20:30.424
I warned you.

20:33.460 --> 20:35.362
Oh, dude, I told you about
the spinnies, man.

20:38.966 --> 20:42.203
Fake soccer, fake soccer injuries.

20:42.236 --> 20:43.670
What's this right here?

20:43.703 --> 20:46.373
Call that real baby brick.

20:46.407 --> 20:47.875
My baby brick.
