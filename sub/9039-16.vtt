WEBVTT

00:02.667 --> 00:04.733
- THAT WAS REALLY
A GREAT DINNER, HUH?

00:04.733 --> 00:05.733
- YEAH, YEAH.

00:05.733 --> 00:08.300
HAPPY ANNIVERSARY.

00:08.300 --> 00:10.033
HEY, YOU KNOW WHAT
I WAS THINKING?

00:10.033 --> 00:11.133
- HMM?

00:11.133 --> 00:13.067
- SINCE THIS IS
OUR TENTH ANNIVERSARY,

00:13.067 --> 00:14.600
WHY DON'T WE LET
THE KIDS STAY

00:14.600 --> 00:17.100
AT GRANDMA'S
AND GRANDPA'S ALL NIGHT,

00:17.100 --> 00:20.400
IF YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN?

00:20.400 --> 00:22.633
- HEY, HEY, WE COULD WATCH
OUR WEDDING VIDEO.

00:26.200 --> 00:27.700
- I GUESS YOU DON'T KNOW
WHAT I MEAN.

00:27.700 --> 00:30.800
- NO.
COME ON.

00:30.800 --> 00:32.833
- WHY?
WHY? WHY?

00:32.833 --> 00:36.300
- WELL, FOR ONE THING,
WATCHING OUR WEDDING VIDEO

00:36.300 --> 00:37.900
MIGHT MAKE TONIGHT
SEEM LIKE OUR HONEYMOON.

00:37.900 --> 00:39.133
- GIMME.
SIT DOWN.

00:39.133 --> 00:41.333
YOU DON'T KNOW HOW
TO USE THIS.

00:41.333 --> 00:43.700
YOU NEVER DID, REALLY.

00:43.700 --> 00:44.933
CAN WE FAST-FORWARD

00:44.933 --> 00:47.133
THROUGH THE CHICKEN DANCE,
PLEASE?

00:47.133 --> 00:48.267
UNLESS THIS TURNS YOU ON...

00:48.267 --> 00:50.933
[mumbles "Chicken Dance"]

00:50.933 --> 00:52.600
- YOU CAN SAVE THAT
FOR LATER.

00:52.600 --> 00:53.867
- HMM.
- OH.

00:53.867 --> 00:56.400
OH, SEE, I LOVE THIS.
ISN'T THIS ROMANTIC?

00:56.400 --> 00:58.267
- YEAH, YEAH, YEAH.
- RIGHT.

00:58.267 --> 00:59.933
- OH, LOOK WHO I GET.

00:59.933 --> 01:02.733
- OH.

01:18.400 --> 01:19.867
WHAT, DID YOU
HIT SOMETHING?

01:19.867 --> 01:20.667
DID YOU HIT SOMETHING?

01:20.667 --> 01:21.867
- NO, NO,
IT'S STILL GOING.

01:21.867 --> 01:24.700
- THEN WHY AM I
SEEING FOOTBALL?

01:24.700 --> 01:25.500
- I--I DON'T KNOW.

01:25.500 --> 01:28.633
- WHERE DID OUR WEDDING GO?

01:39.600 --> 01:40.800
- WELL, SOMETHING
MUST BE WRONG HERE.

01:40.800 --> 01:42.133
- OH, MY GOD.

01:42.133 --> 01:44.833
YOU TAPED FOOTBALL
OVER MY WEDDING.

01:44.833 --> 01:46.200
- ALL RIGHT, PLEASE--
- WHAT DID YOU DO, RAY?

01:46.200 --> 01:47.633
WHAT THE HELL
DID YOU DO?

01:47.633 --> 01:48.600
- NO.

01:48.600 --> 01:50.167
COME ON,
DON'T GET EXCITED.

01:50.167 --> 01:51.000
OH, WAIT, WAIT, WAIT.
LOOK AT THAT.

01:51.000 --> 01:53.233
- WHAT? IT'S FOOTBALL.
IT'S STILL FOOTBALL, RAY.

01:53.233 --> 01:54.500
- YEAH, BUT IT'S
THE BILLS-GIANTS SUPER BOWL.

01:54.500 --> 01:56.267
- I DON'T CARE.
YOU GIVE ME THAT.

01:56.267 --> 01:58.467
OH, MY GOD.
LOOK AT THIS.

01:58.467 --> 02:01.367
MY GOD,
IT'S THE WHOLE THING, RAY.

02:01.367 --> 02:02.500
- THE KIDS MUST HAVE
DONE THAT.

02:02.500 --> 02:04.367
- OH, RIGHT. OH, YEAH.
THE KIDS TAPE FOOTBALL, RAY.

02:04.367 --> 02:08.067
THE LAST THING THEY PUT
IN THE VCR WAS LEMON CHICKEN.

02:08.067 --> 02:09.200
- SEE, I'D NEVER DO THAT,

02:09.200 --> 02:10.433
BECAUSE I LOVE YOUR
LEMON CHICKEN--

02:10.433 --> 02:11.267
- SHUT UP.

02:11.267 --> 02:13.400
I WANT MY WEDDING.
THIS IS FOOTBALL.

02:13.400 --> 02:14.400
- ALL RIGHT,
COULD WE JUST STAY CALM?

02:14.400 --> 02:17.700
- NO, YOU GIVE ME
MY WEDDING BACK.

02:17.700 --> 02:18.767
- I DON'T KNOW
WHAT HAPPENED.

02:18.767 --> 02:20.267
I GUESS THE TAPE
WASN'T MARKED CORRECTLY.

02:20.267 --> 02:21.567
- OH, THE TAPE WASN'T
MARKED CORRECTLY?

02:21.567 --> 02:23.067
YOU DON'T THINK THAT TAPE
WAS MARKED CORRECTLY?

02:23.067 --> 02:24.100
WHAT IS THIS, RAY?

02:24.100 --> 02:26.167
WHAT IS THIS BIG WHITE LABEL
THAT SAYS,

02:26.167 --> 02:30.033
"OUR WEDDING"
IN GOLD TRIM?

02:30.033 --> 02:31.167
- DID IT ALWAYS
SAY THAT?

02:31.167 --> 02:32.767
- WHY WOULD YOU USE
THIS TAPE?

02:32.767 --> 02:35.367
I DON'T KNOW.
THE GAME WAS NINE YEARS AGO.

02:35.367 --> 02:37.133
MAYBE, YOU KNOW,
THE GUYS MIGHT HAVE BEEN OVER,

02:37.133 --> 02:38.367
AND IF THE GAME
WAS GETTING GOOD,

02:38.367 --> 02:40.200
SOMEBODY SAID, "HEY,
YOU SHOULD BE TAPING THIS."

02:40.200 --> 02:41.433
AND YOU KNOW ME,

02:41.433 --> 02:42.833
I WAS JUST TRYING
TO BE A GOOD HOST.

02:42.833 --> 02:46.133
I SAID, "HEY, THAT'S A GOOD
IDEA, SOMEONE ELSE."

02:46.133 --> 02:47.833
HEY, YOU KNOW SOMETHING,
I HAVE AN IDEA.

02:47.833 --> 02:50.167
NEXT TIME, IF YOU HAVE
SOMETHING ON TAPE

02:50.167 --> 02:51.833
THAT YOU LIKE
AND YOU WANT TO SAVE IT,

02:51.833 --> 02:53.733
YOU--YOU SEE THIS--
YOU SEE THE TAB RIGHT THERE?

02:53.733 --> 02:55.700
YOU JUST POP IT OUT;
YOU POP THE TAB OUT.

02:55.700 --> 02:57.333
AND THEN--THEN
THE MACHINE KNOWS,

02:57.333 --> 02:59.733
"OH, YOU MUST
REALLY LIKE THAT.

02:59.733 --> 03:04.133
I WON'T TAPE OVER IT.
I WON'T."

03:04.133 --> 03:08.100
YOU JUST POP IT OUT.
YOU POP THE TAB OUT.

03:16.100 --> 03:20.000
[sighs]

03:20.000 --> 03:23.733
OKAY, TEN YEARS.
THAT'S ENOUGH.

03:30.200 --> 03:32.600
- RAYMOND.

03:32.600 --> 03:34.167
- OH, GOOD MORNING.

03:34.167 --> 03:35.300
- EVERYTHING ALL RIGHT,
DEAR?

03:35.300 --> 03:37.300
- YEAH, YEAH, JUST--

03:37.300 --> 03:40.833
THE ANNIVERSARY WAS SO EXCITING,
YOU KNOW,

03:40.833 --> 03:41.967
I--I NEEDED A BREAK.

03:41.967 --> 03:43.133
THAT'S ALL.

03:43.133 --> 03:46.700
- EGGS, MARIE.

03:46.700 --> 03:47.933
SCRAMBLED.

03:47.933 --> 03:50.933
AND THEY'VE BEEN LOOKING
A LITTLE PALE LATELY.

03:50.933 --> 03:54.100
STOP HOLDING BACK ON THE YOLKS.

03:54.100 --> 03:55.767
- I'M NOT HOLDING BACK.

03:55.767 --> 03:56.767
- I'M ON TO YOU.

03:56.767 --> 03:59.533
DADDY WANTS HIS YOLKS.

03:59.533 --> 04:01.767
- YOU GET EVERY YOLK,
FRANK.

04:01.767 --> 04:06.133
WHAT POSSIBLE REASON WOULD I
HAVE FOR PROLONGING YOUR LIFE?

04:09.967 --> 04:11.667
- IS ROBERT UP YET?

04:11.667 --> 04:13.467
- YOU MEAN HOPALONG?

04:13.467 --> 04:16.300
- HE WAS GORED BY A BULL,
FRANK.

04:16.300 --> 04:18.533
HE CAN'T HELP IT.

04:18.533 --> 04:20.600
- WHEN IS HE GOING TO GET RID
OF THAT WALKER?

04:20.600 --> 04:22.967
I MEAN, I GOT STUCK BEHIND HIM
TWICE TODAY:

04:22.967 --> 04:25.400
THE STAIRS AND THE BATHROOM.

04:29.700 --> 04:34.900
- THANKS FOR SHOVING PAST ME
ON THE STEPS, DAD.

04:34.900 --> 04:36.200
- YOU WERE IN THE THE FAST LANE.

04:36.200 --> 04:38.900
GET OVER TO THE RIGHT.

04:38.900 --> 04:40.600
- ROBERT, DID YOU FIND HIM?

04:40.600 --> 04:43.567
- BAD NEWS, RAY.
THE GUY'S IN PRISON.

04:43.567 --> 04:45.667
- PRISON?
- WHO? WHO'S IN PRISON?

04:45.667 --> 04:48.633
- JAMES LEMUS, THE GUY
WHO VIDEOED RAY'S WEDDING.

04:48.633 --> 04:50.667
HE WENT FROM DOING
WEDDING VIDEOS

04:50.667 --> 04:52.167
TO HONEYMOON VIDEOS

04:52.167 --> 04:55.800
WITHOUT THE CONSENT
OF THE HONEYMOONERS.

04:55.800 --> 04:57.300
- WHAT ABOUT HIS OLD TAPES?

04:57.300 --> 04:58.733
I GOT TO GET MY ORIGINAL.

04:58.733 --> 05:01.533
- ALL GONE, RAYMOND,
IMPOUNDED AND DESTROYED.

05:01.533 --> 05:06.767
- OKAY, THEN.
MOM, CAN I LIVE HERE?

05:06.767 --> 05:08.200
- OF COURSE YOU CAN, DEAR.

05:08.200 --> 05:11.833
WHAT DID DEBRA DO?

05:11.833 --> 05:13.767
- SHE'S HAVING A BAD REACTION

05:13.767 --> 05:17.567
TO ME ACCIDENTALLY TAPING
OVER OUR WEDDING VIDEO.

05:17.567 --> 05:19.833
- OH, MY GOD.

05:19.833 --> 05:22.767
- HOLY CRAP.

05:29.333 --> 05:30.567
- I DON'T UNDERSTAND.

05:30.567 --> 05:32.700
WHAT WOULD YOU TAPE
OVER YOUR WEDDING?

05:32.700 --> 05:34.000
- FOOTBALL.

05:34.000 --> 05:36.500
- SPORTS?

05:36.500 --> 05:38.067
SPORTS?

05:38.067 --> 05:39.467
- IT WAS THE SUPER BOWL, MA.

05:39.467 --> 05:41.800
- IT DOESN'T MATTER
IF IT WAS A SUPER-DUPER BOWL.

05:41.800 --> 05:43.867
IT'S STILL SPORTS.

05:43.867 --> 05:45.167
- I KNOW.

05:45.167 --> 05:47.267
- HEY, GOOD WORK, RAY.

05:47.267 --> 05:49.267
NOW WHEN SOME BROAD
STARTS YAPPING...

05:49.267 --> 05:51.433
[in high voice]
"YOU'RE NEVER ROMANTIC,"

05:51.433 --> 05:54.533
GUYS EVERYWHERE CAN SAY,
"HEY, YOU THINK I'M BAD?

05:54.533 --> 05:57.767
AT LEAST I DIDN'T PULL
A RAY BARONE."

06:00.200 --> 06:04.167
- I MUST SAY,
I'M SURPRISED, RAYMOND.

06:04.167 --> 06:05.833
YOU'RE NOT USUALLY
SO THOUGHTLESS

06:05.833 --> 06:07.133
AND INCONSIDERATE.

06:07.133 --> 06:10.067
HE GETS THIS
FROM YOU, FRANK.

06:10.067 --> 06:13.133
- AT LEAST I DIDN'T PULL
A RAY BARONE.

06:13.133 --> 06:16.067
- ALL RIGHT.
I'LL SEE YOU.

06:16.067 --> 06:17.067
- WHERE ARE YOU GOING?

06:17.067 --> 06:18.233
- I DON'T KNOW.

06:18.233 --> 06:21.633
MAYBE WALK BY THE RIVER.

06:21.633 --> 06:23.833
- YOU HAVE TO MAKE THIS RIGHT,
RAYMOND.

06:23.833 --> 06:25.067
- WELL, THE TAPE'S GONE, MA.

06:25.067 --> 06:26.267
WHAT DO YOU WANT ME TO DO,

06:26.267 --> 06:27.967
STAPLE OUR WEDDING PHOTOS
TOGETHER

06:27.967 --> 06:30.333
AND MAKE A FLIP BOOK?

06:30.333 --> 06:31.600
- WELL, I'LL TELL YOU
WHAT I WOULD LIKE

06:31.600 --> 06:32.533
IF I WERE DEBRA.

06:32.533 --> 06:34.167
- I'D LIKE IT
IF YOU WERE DEBRA.

06:34.167 --> 06:35.500
- OH, FRANK.

06:35.500 --> 06:38.067
- WHAT, WHAT?
TELL ME, MA, WHAT?

06:38.067 --> 06:39.600
- RENEW YOUR WEDDING VOWS.

06:39.600 --> 06:41.167
- YEAH, AND THEN YOU CAN
VIDEOTAPE THAT.

06:41.167 --> 06:42.833
THAT'S A GREAT IDEA, MA.

06:42.833 --> 06:43.667
- HEY, REENACTMENT.

06:43.667 --> 06:45.833
THAT'S JUST LIKE WHAT
MY CIVIL WAR BUDDIES DO.

06:45.833 --> 06:49.500
- WHAT YOUR CIVIL WAR BUDDIES DO
IS GET DRUNK AND PEE OUTSIDE.

06:53.633 --> 06:55.167
- YOU KNOW WHAT
THE SOUTHERNERS DO?

06:55.167 --> 06:57.767
- OH, STOP IT, FRANK.

06:57.767 --> 07:00.067
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT
A BEAUTIFUL THING,

07:00.067 --> 07:01.333
A WEDDING,

07:01.333 --> 07:04.033
A RENEWAL OF COMMITMENT
AND LOVE, FRANK.

07:04.033 --> 07:06.733
LOVE.
YOU UNDERSTAND LOVE?

07:06.733 --> 07:11.267
- BY ALL MEANS, RAY,
HURRY UP AND RENEW THIS.

07:11.267 --> 07:12.733
- I DON'T KNOW, MA.
IT ALL SEEMS KIND OF--

07:12.733 --> 07:15.467
- YOU HAVE TAKEN
DEBRA'S WEDDING AWAY.

07:15.467 --> 07:17.700
AND NO MATTER WHAT PEOPLE
MAY SAY ABOUT HER,

07:17.700 --> 07:21.367
SHE'S STILL A WOMAN.

07:21.367 --> 07:24.200
AND YOU DON'T TAKE THAT AWAY
FROM A WOMAN.

07:24.200 --> 07:26.400
THE ONLY THING YOU NEED
TO WORRY ABOUT

07:26.400 --> 07:28.600
IS IF SHE EVER FORGIVES YOU
FOR WHAT YOU'VE DONE.

07:28.600 --> 07:30.867
- BUT I--I GUESS
SHE'LL LIKE IT,

07:30.867 --> 07:32.967
BUT I DON'T KNOW ANYTHING
ABOUT THIS RENEWAL STUFF.

07:32.967 --> 07:34.467
- LEAVE IT ALL TO ME.

07:34.467 --> 07:36.667
I'LL HANDLE
ALL THE ARRANGEMENTS.

07:36.667 --> 07:38.267
- YEAH?

07:38.267 --> 07:40.267
- YES, I WOULD DO THAT.

07:40.267 --> 07:41.867
- OKAY, ALL RIGHT.

07:41.867 --> 07:43.367
- OH, UH, MARIE,

07:43.367 --> 07:48.533
I WOULD LIKE TO RENEW
MY BREAKFAST ORDER:

07:48.533 --> 07:49.700
EGGS!

07:54.300 --> 07:57.167
- OH, GOOD.
I'M GLAD YOU'RE UP.

07:57.167 --> 08:00.800
I GOT SOME GOOD NEWS,
AND I GOT SOME BAD NEWS.

08:00.800 --> 08:04.500
THE BAD NEWS IS THAT
IF YOU LIKE BEING MAD AT ME,

08:04.500 --> 08:07.367
YOU'RE OUT OF LUCK,
M'LADY.

08:09.700 --> 08:11.567
THE GOOD NEWS IS,

08:11.567 --> 08:13.233
I COULDN'T GET
THE TAPE BACK,

08:13.233 --> 08:16.067
WHICH I KNOW SOUNDS
LIKE BAD NEWS

08:16.067 --> 08:17.867
BUT ACTUALLY IS GOOD NEWS,

08:17.867 --> 08:19.500
BECAUSE IF
THAT TAPE EXISTED,

08:19.500 --> 08:24.367
WE WOULDN'T BE ABLE
TO GET MARRIED AGAIN.

08:26.833 --> 08:29.433
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

08:29.433 --> 08:34.367
- I'VE BEEN THINKING
ABOUT IT ALL NIGHT.

08:34.367 --> 08:36.933
LET'S RENEW OUR VOWS.

08:36.933 --> 08:37.833
- WHAT?

08:37.833 --> 08:41.033
- LOOK, I TOOK YOUR WEDDING
AWAY FROM YOU,

08:41.033 --> 08:42.833
AND--AND--AND I KNOW
YOU'RE A WOMAN,

08:42.833 --> 08:45.500
AND YOU DON'T TAKE THAT
AWAY FROM A WOMAN.

08:45.500 --> 08:48.400
SO LET ME GIVE IT
BACK TO YOU.

08:48.400 --> 08:50.533
- YOU KNOW,
JUST FORGET IT, RAY.

08:50.533 --> 08:52.500
THE TAPE IS GONE.
I'LL GET OVER IT.

08:52.500 --> 08:56.367
- I KNOW YOU WILL,
BUT THIS WILL BE FASTER.

09:02.033 --> 09:04.267
COME ON, LET'S DO THIS.
I FEEL BAD.

09:04.267 --> 09:06.600
I WAS THOUGHTLESS
AND--AND CARELESS,

09:06.600 --> 09:09.800
AND I WANT TO
MAKE IT UP TO YOU.

09:09.800 --> 09:11.467
AND IT'S OUR TENTH ANNIVERSARY.

09:11.467 --> 09:13.100
WE SHOULD DO
SOMETHING SPECIAL.

09:13.100 --> 09:15.600
WE'LL INVITE FRIENDS OVER,
WE'LL GET DRESSED UP,

09:15.600 --> 09:17.400
HAVE MUSIC AND FLOWERS,

09:17.400 --> 09:20.267
AND--OH, YOU WON'T HAVE
TO DO A THING.

09:20.267 --> 09:23.000
AND--AND A PRIEST,
WE'LL GET ONE OF THOSE.

09:23.000 --> 09:24.533
AND WE'LL WRITE NEW VOWS.

09:24.533 --> 09:26.300
THEN WE'LL VIDEOTAPE THOSE,

09:26.300 --> 09:31.133
AND WE'LL POP THE TAB OUT
OF THAT RIGHT AWAY.

09:31.133 --> 09:35.033
I JUST WANT TO DO THIS,
BECAUSE...

09:35.033 --> 09:37.500
BECAUSE.

09:44.633 --> 09:46.500
I HAD A GOOD IDEA?

09:46.500 --> 09:48.333
- IT'S WONDERFUL, RAY.

09:48.333 --> 09:50.167
I MEAN, YOU WOULD REALLY
GET UP IN FRONT OF PEOPLE

09:50.167 --> 09:51.633
AND RECITE NEW VOWS FOR ME?

09:51.633 --> 09:53.400
- SURE. YEAH, YEAH.

STUPID.
STUPID RENEWAL.

10:33.967 --> 10:35.500
- SO WHAT DO YOU GOT SO FAR?

10:35.500 --> 10:37.800

ON A MOTIF.

10:37.800 --> 10:40.700

I HAD TO BUY SOME PORN
JUST TO EVEN IT OUT.

10:51.900 --> 10:56.167

DRESS UP THE TWINS.

THEY DON'T DO THAT.

13:19.967 --> 13:21.133
- SURE THEY DO.

13:21.133 --> 13:22.800
IT'S DARK CHOCOLATE

WITH A WHITE-CHOCOLATE FRONT

13:24.067 --> 13:26.067

I DON'T SEE ANY
LILIES OF THE VALLEY.

15:40.900 --> 15:43.400

UM, WELL, WHEN--
WHEN RAY FIRST CAME TO ME

17:26.467 --> 17:30.533
WITH THIS IDEA,
I WAS VERY TOUCHED.

I'M REALLY GLAD TO HAVE
THIS CHANCE TO TELL PEOPLE

19:03.800 --> 19:06.367
THE LUCKIEST MAN...

19:06.367 --> 19:09.500
ON THE FACE
OF THE EARTH.

19:14.000 --> 19:16.033
OKAY, I FORGOT
THE VOWS.

19:16.033 --> 19:18.333
BUT THAT DOESN'T MEAN
THAT I DON'T CARE ABOUT YOU

19:18.333 --> 19:20.233
BECAUSE OF THAT,
AND--AND BECAUSE

19:20.233 --> 19:21.833
I TAPED FOOTBALL
OVER OUR WEDDING VIDEO.

19:21.833 --> 19:24.633
- YOU TAPED FOOTBALL
OVER YOUR WEDDING VIDEO?

19:27.067 --> 19:32.033
- YES, I MADE A MISTAKE.

19:33.533 --> 19:36.667
- YOU SAID YOU WERE GOING
TO RECITE VOWS TO ME.

19:36.667 --> 19:37.533
- OKAY, I KNOW.

19:37.533 --> 19:38.600
I KNOW,
BUT WE HAD YOUR VOWS,

19:38.600 --> 19:39.800
AND, OH, THEY
WERE BEAUTIFUL.

19:39.800 --> 19:42.033
AND--AND I DIDN'T REALLY
HEAR 'EM ALL,

19:42.033 --> 19:44.900
BECAUSE I WAS IN MY HEAD GOING
"IDIOT, IDIOT, IDIOT, IDIOT."

19:44.900 --> 19:48.867
BUT--BUT, YOU KNOW, LUCKILY,
ROBERT VIDEOTAPED 'EM,

19:48.867 --> 19:50.500
AND WE CAN
ENJOY 'EM LATER.

20:03.633 --> 20:07.033
- YOU NEVER TOLD ME
TO TAPE IT.

20:07.033 --> 20:10.967
- OKAY, BUT, BUT, BUT--

20:10.967 --> 20:12.033
HONEY, LOOK AT ALL
THE DECORATING

20:12.033 --> 20:13.167

20:16.133 --> 20:17.900
AND, SEE, LOOK,

AND THERE WERE SUPPOSED TO BE
LILIES OF THE VALLEY HERE.

20:20.500 --> 20:23.000
BUT THE NAPKINS,
THEY MATCH THE TABLECLOTH.

20:23.000 --> 20:25.567
I DID THAT.

20:25.567 --> 20:28.700
ALL RIGHT.

20:28.700 --> 20:30.300
I'M SORRY.

20:30.300 --> 20:31.833

20:31.833 --> 20:35.100
- YEAH, THAT'S YOUR
FAVORITE FLOWER, RIGHT?

20:35.100 --> 20:37.100
- YOU REMEMBERED?

20:37.100 --> 20:37.900
- YEAH, I ORDERED 'EM,

20:37.900 --> 20:42.067
BUT THE DAMN FLORIST,
HE DIDN'T BRING IT.

- YOU REMEMBERED
MY FLOWER.

20:48.233 --> 20:49.433
- KISS THE BRIDE.

IF I MAY ASK...

21:06.567 --> 21:09.700
WHAT GAME WAS IT?

21:09.700 --> 21:12.500
- IT WAS THE '91 SUPER BOWL.
BILLS AND GIANTS.

21:12.500 --> 21:15.133
- OH, GOOD GAME,
GOOD GAME.

- I KNOW, I KNOW.
I STILL HAVE IT ON TAPE.

21:19.933 --> 21:21.433
BUT WE'RE NOT--
THAT'S NOT WHY WE'RE HERE.

21:21.433 --> 21:23.433
WE'RE NOT HERE FOR THAT.
