WEBVTT

00:01.959 --> 00:03.333
OK, STOP STEPPING.
STOP, OK.

00:03.333 --> 00:04.583
OK, THERE WE GO.
NO PEEKING.

00:04.583 --> 00:05.500
NO PEEKING.
I'M NOT PEEKIN'.

00:05.500 --> 00:07.959
TRUST ME.
CHEATERS
NEVER PROSPER.

00:07.959 --> 00:09.166
[BOTH LAUGH]
OK.

00:09.166 --> 00:10.250
OK, CURVE TO THE RIGHT.
CURVE TO THE RIGHT.

00:10.250 --> 00:14.250
THIS WAY? OK.
NOW WE'RE COMIN'--OW!

00:14.250 --> 00:14.625
DUH.

00:14.625 --> 00:16.875
SORRY.

00:16.875 --> 00:18.000
IT'S OK.
IT WAS THE DOOR.

00:18.000 --> 00:19.291
YEAH.
OK, THERE'S A CHAIR.

00:19.291 --> 00:20.542
OK, SIT DOWN
IN THE CHAIR.

00:20.542 --> 00:22.542
SIT DOWN IN THE CHAIR.
OK. ALL RIGHT.

00:22.542 --> 00:24.333
OPEN YOUR EYES.

00:27.166 --> 00:29.625
OK, YOU REALIZE
FOR THE "HANDS OVER
THE EYES" GAME TO WORK

00:29.625 --> 00:30.625
THE PRESENT HAS TO BE
ON THE TABLE?

00:30.625 --> 00:32.000
YOU REALIZE THAT
TO CRITICIZE THE METHOD

00:32.000 --> 00:34.417
IN WHICH THE PRESENTS
ARE PRESENTED

00:34.417 --> 00:36.458
MEANS THAT YOU WILL
NEVER GET PRESENTS AGAIN.

00:36.458 --> 00:37.792
YOU'RE VERY PRETTY.

00:37.792 --> 00:39.333
ALL RIGHT.

00:39.333 --> 00:41.583
SINCE IT IS YOUR BIG DAY,

00:41.583 --> 00:43.166
AND WE MISSED THE REQUISITE
BACK-TO-SCHOOL SHOPPING--

00:43.166 --> 00:45.667
YOU MEAN LIKE
THE SALE AT OLD NAVY?

00:45.667 --> 00:47.875
RIGHT, BECAUSE
NOTHING SMELLS MORE

00:47.875 --> 00:49.875
LIKE THE FIRST DAY
OF SCHOOL THAN CHEAP FLEECE,

00:49.875 --> 00:52.375
UM, BUT I WAS THINKING
MORE ALONG THE LINES
OF THE BASICS.

00:52.375 --> 00:54.583
NUMBER ONE,
NUMBER 2 PENCILS.

00:54.583 --> 00:56.458
AW, A CLASSIC.

00:56.458 --> 00:57.125
PENCIL SHARPENER.

00:57.125 --> 01:01.125
LOOSE-LEAF BINDER PAPER.

01:01.125 --> 01:03.750
LITTLE REINFORCEMENT TABBIES
FOR LOOSE-LEAF BINDER PAPER.

01:03.750 --> 01:05.083
IMPRESSIVE. VERY GOOD.

01:05.083 --> 01:09.208
PENS. ERASERS.

01:09.208 --> 01:12.333
ERASERS.
UM, AND A RULER.

01:12.333 --> 01:15.375
NO MATH AT FILM SCHOOL,
BUT I APPRECIATE
THE THOUGHT.

01:15.375 --> 01:18.834
AND FINALLY,
LA PIECE DE LA RESISTANCE.

01:29.834 --> 01:30.875
OH, MY GOD.

01:30.875 --> 01:32.417
[LAUGHS]
I REALLY WANTED

01:32.417 --> 01:35.750
TO GET SOME REESE'S PIECES
SO I COULD PUT 'EM

01:35.750 --> 01:37.125
IN THE LITTLE PLASTIC
PENCIL HOLDER THINGIE,

01:37.125 --> 01:39.500
BUT I FELT LIKE
IT WOULD BE TOO MUCH.

01:39.500 --> 01:41.125
NICE SHOW OF RESTRAINT
ON YOUR PART.

01:41.125 --> 01:43.583
[LAUGHS]
THANK YOU, JEN.

01:43.583 --> 01:46.417
SO, ARE YOU
A LITTLE NERVOUS?

01:46.417 --> 01:47.750
NO, NOT AT ALL.

01:47.750 --> 01:50.417
IT'S 3 CLASSES,
YOU KNOW?

01:50.417 --> 01:52.500
NOTHING
TOO OVERWHELMING,
WHICH IS THE KEY.

01:52.500 --> 01:53.542
YEAH, THAT'S GOOD.

01:53.542 --> 01:55.583
YOU'RE JUST GONNA
EASE RIGHT INTO IT.

01:55.583 --> 01:58.708
THAT RIGOROUS
COLLEGE SCHEDULE
OF NAPPING AND DRINKING.

01:58.708 --> 01:59.708
THAT'S THE PLAN.

01:59.708 --> 02:02.500
WHAT, UH, TIME
IS YOUR SHOW?

02:02.500 --> 02:03.500
UM...

02:03.500 --> 02:04.583
UH, IT'S REALLY SOON
IS WHAT IT IS.

02:04.583 --> 02:06.291
UM, I SHOULD ACTUALLY
FINISH GETTING READY.

02:06.291 --> 02:09.041
UH, WILL YOU MEET ME
LATER FOR LUNCH?

02:09.041 --> 02:10.750
I WOULD LOVE TO.

02:19.083 --> 02:19.875
BABY, I GOTTA GO.

02:19.875 --> 02:21.375
OK.
OK.

02:24.208 --> 02:27.500
WAIT! BABY, BABY.

02:27.500 --> 02:29.000
YOU FORGOT
YOUR TRAPPER KEEPER.

02:29.000 --> 02:33.417
OH. AN OVERSIGHT
ON MY PART.

02:33.417 --> 02:35.750
COULDN'T WANT TO
LEAVE THE HOUSE
WITHOUT THIS.

02:35.750 --> 02:36.458
MMM.

02:36.458 --> 02:38.083
[GIGGLES]
THANK YOU.

02:38.083 --> 02:40.583
BYE-BYE. [GIGGLES]

02:42.458 --> 02:44.166
HAVE A GOOD DAY
AT SCHOOL, SWEETIE.

02:44.166 --> 02:47.375
[GIGGLES]

02:47.375 --> 02:49.250
[WHISPERS] He's so cute!

03:35.792 --> 03:36.917
Elliot: ADMIT IT.

03:36.917 --> 03:38.375
IT'S ONE STEP ABOVE
A JACKIE COLLINS NOVEL.

03:38.375 --> 03:41.500
IT'S ALL SMUT
AND NO SUBSTANCE.

03:41.500 --> 03:44.041
I DIDN'T REALIZE
YOU WERE SO FAMILIAR
WITH JACKIE'S WORK.

03:44.041 --> 03:45.208
I MEAN, DON'T BE
ASHAMED OR ANYTHING.

03:45.208 --> 03:48.083
DON'T GO CHANGING
THE SUBJECT

03:48.083 --> 03:49.000
DOIN' YOUR LITTLE
HAIR FLIPPY THING,

03:49.000 --> 03:51.291
TRYIN' TO DISTRACT ME.

03:51.291 --> 03:53.417
I'M WISE
TO YOUR WAYS, POTTER.

03:53.417 --> 03:56.458
[LAUGHS] I'M SORRY.

03:56.458 --> 03:58.125
WHAT WERE WE TALKING
ABOUT AGAIN?

03:58.125 --> 03:59.708
[SIGHS]
I JUST WANT YOU TO ADMIT

03:59.708 --> 04:01.208
THAT THE ONLY REASON YOU LIKE
PROFESSOR WILDER'S BOOK

04:01.208 --> 04:04.083
IS BECAUSE
YOU THINK HE'S CUTE.

04:05.542 --> 04:07.041
WELL, I CAN'T,
BECAUSE THAT'S NOT TRUE.

04:07.041 --> 04:10.208
IT IS OBVIOUS THAT THE ONLY
REASON YOU DON'T LIKE HIS BOOK

04:10.208 --> 04:11.458
IS BECAUSE YOU THINK

04:11.458 --> 04:12.458
IT'S AFFECTING YOUR
MOJO WITH THE LADIES.

04:12.458 --> 04:14.208
WELL, THAT SHOWS
HOW LITTLE YOU KNOW ME.

04:14.208 --> 04:16.791
I HAVE NO MOJO
TO SPEAK OF.

04:18.750 --> 04:19.541
I THINK
YOU HAVE A LITTLE.

04:22.875 --> 04:23.875
SO, CAN I ASK YOU
A QUESTION?

04:23.875 --> 04:26.208
YOU CAN.

04:26.208 --> 04:27.875
OK. ON FRIDAY NIGHT,

04:27.875 --> 04:29.583
UNLESS YOU'RE BUSY, AND
I KNOW IT'S ONLY MONDAY,

04:29.583 --> 04:32.583
BUT, YOU KNOW, SOMETIMES
PEOPLE, LIKE, MAKE PLANS

04:32.583 --> 04:33.750
FOR TRIPS OR SOMETHING
KIND OF EARLY, SO--

04:33.750 --> 04:37.041
ELLIOT?

04:37.041 --> 04:37.750
WOULD YOU MAYBE
WANT TO SEE SOMETHING?

04:37.750 --> 04:39.917
OR...

04:39.917 --> 04:41.000
EAT SOMETHING?

04:41.000 --> 04:42.417
WITH ME?

04:42.417 --> 04:44.750
ARE YOU ASKING ME
TO DINNER AND A MOVIE?

04:44.750 --> 04:47.291
KIND OF, BUT DINNER AND
A MOVIE JUST SOUNDED SO...

04:47.291 --> 04:48.750
DATE, YOU KNOW?

04:48.750 --> 04:51.375
AND THIS WAY, YOU KNOW,
IT SOUNDED MUCH BETTER.

04:51.375 --> 04:52.417
TO ME... IN MY MIND.

04:55.792 --> 04:56.959
I WOULD LOVE TO...

04:56.959 --> 04:59.959
EAT AND SEE SOMETHING
WITH YOU ON FRIDAY.

04:59.959 --> 05:01.500
REALLY?

05:01.500 --> 05:02.750
WHOA! WHOA!

05:02.750 --> 05:04.000

05:04.000 --> 05:05.458

05:05.458 --> 05:06.000

05:06.000 --> 05:08.291
OH. BUMMER.

05:11.667 --> 05:13.125

05:13.125 --> 05:15.583
ARE WE MOUSSING?

05:15.583 --> 05:17.250
YOU KNOW,
THAT'S MY CUE, SO...

05:17.250 --> 05:18.625
UH, I'LL SEE YOU
IN CLASS.

05:18.625 --> 05:19.667
I'LL BE THERE.

05:19.667 --> 05:20.083

KIND OF OFFICIAL.

06:58.708 --> 07:00.708
IT'S FROM A COLLEGE,
SO I THOUGHT...

07:05.917 --> 07:07.583
HMM. HEY, COME ON,
YOU WANNA PLAY?

07:07.583 --> 07:10.208

07:16.875 --> 07:18.417
I FAILED

07:18.417 --> 07:19.750
NO BIG DEAL.
I'LL MAKE IT UP.

07:19.750 --> 07:21.375
BUT WHEN THEY PUT YOU
ON PROBATION--

07:21.375 --> 07:22.875

08:39.207 --> 08:41.000
LIKE THAT'S
AN ACCOMPLISHMENT,

08:41.000 --> 08:42.457
I THINK
SHE HEARD YOU.

08:42.457 --> 08:43.958
NOW, THE GUY

08:51.959 --> 08:53.750
NOW, THE GUY
UP THERE,

08:53.750 --> 08:55.542
WROTE AND DIRECTED
THE WORST PIECE
OF DRECK

08:55.542 --> 08:57.166
EVER TO COME OUT
OF A FILM SCHOOL!

08:57.166 --> 08:58.708
YOU KNOW WHAT?
I'LL--I'M JUST GONNA

08:58.708 --> 09:00.333
INTRODUCE MYSELF
AROUND.

09:00.333 --> 09:02.667
OK. HEY. HEY.
WHATEVER FLOATS
YOUR BOAT.

09:08.333 --> 09:10.041
WELL, FOR THOSE OF YOU
WHO HAVE TUNED IN

09:10.041 --> 09:11.542
EXPECTING
TO HEAR NICK DRAKE:

09:11.542 --> 09:12.959
GET WITH
THE PROGRAM, PEOPLE.

09:12.959 --> 09:14.250
I'VE BEEN DOING THIS
FOR WEEKS.

09:14.250 --> 09:16.083
THIS IS JEN LINDLEY,

09:16.083 --> 09:18.417
AND I'M HERE
TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS
THAT YOU MAY HAVE

09:18.417 --> 09:20.625
CONCERNING
MATTERS OF THE HEART.

09:20.625 --> 09:22.083
OR THE GROIN.

09:22.083 --> 09:23.750
CALLER NUMBER ONE,
YOU'RE ON THE AIR.

09:23.750 --> 09:24.750
UH, JEN, HI.

09:24.750 --> 09:26.208
AUDREY LIDDELL HERE.

09:26.208 --> 09:27.500
OK, MY QUESTION
OF THE DAY IS THIS:

09:27.500 --> 09:29.792
WHY DO GUYS DO ANYTHING
TO GET YOUR PHONE NUMBER,

09:29.792 --> 09:31.875
BUT ONCE THEY HAVE IT
NEVER USE IT PROPERLY?

09:31.875 --> 09:34.250
WHY DO THEY ONLY USE IT FOR
A BOOTY CALL? OH, AND FOOTNOTE:

09:34.250 --> 09:36.166
WHERE DOES THE TERM
"BOOTY CALL" COME FROM?

09:36.166 --> 09:37.583
I MEAN, IF "BOOTY"
MEANS "SEX,"

09:37.583 --> 09:40.417
WHY DON'T PEOPLE EVER SAY,
"LET'S GO HAVE BOOTY"?

09:40.417 --> 09:42.834
OH, FIRST OF ALL, UH,
I JUST WANNA REITERATE,
AUDREY,

09:42.834 --> 09:44.542
YOU DON'T HAVE
TO USE YOUR FULL NAME

09:44.542 --> 09:46.708
EVERY TIME
THAT YOU CALL IN
TO THE RADIO SHOW,

09:46.708 --> 09:48.083
IT'S SUPPOSED
TO BE CONFIDENTIAL.

09:48.083 --> 09:49.583
I HAVE NOTHING
TO HIDE, SUGARPLUM.

09:49.583 --> 09:50.750
SECONDLY, CALLERS,

09:50.750 --> 09:51.708
YOUR QUESTIONS DO NOT
HAVE TO BE RELEGATED

09:51.708 --> 09:54.041
TO TOPICS
OF A SEXUAL NATURE.

09:54.041 --> 09:57.083
THERE IS SO MUCH MORE
TO LIFE THAN BOOTY.

09:57.083 --> 09:59.083
THERE'S LOVE AND...

09:59.083 --> 10:01.625
ROMANCE
AND TENDERNESS...

10:01.625 --> 10:04.250
ARE YOU DONE WITH
THE PUBLIC SERVICE
ANNOUNCEMENT? GREAT.

10:04.250 --> 10:05.500
SO HERE'S
WHAT HAPPENED.

10:05.500 --> 10:07.375
SATURDAY NIGHT, I'M WEARING
MY NEW BOOTS.

10:07.375 --> 10:10.333
I'M LOOKING GOOD. I MEET
THIS GUY--LET'S JUST
CALL HIM BUTTFACE.

10:10.333 --> 10:11.542
I'M GONNA
STOP YOU RIGHT THERE,

10:11.542 --> 10:13.417
'CAUSE I ALREADY KNOW
WHAT'S WRONG.

10:13.417 --> 10:14.542
YOU DO?

10:14.542 --> 10:16.583
YOU ARE JUST BATHING
IN NEGATIVE ENERGY.

10:16.583 --> 10:18.667
YOU'VE LOST THE LOVE.

10:18.667 --> 10:19.792
I'VE LOST THE WHAT?

10:19.792 --> 10:20.542
THE LOVE.

10:20.542 --> 10:22.417
AND YOU SHOULD FIND IT,

10:22.417 --> 10:23.458
YOU SHOULD NURTURE IT,

10:23.458 --> 10:25.875
AND YOU SHOULD SHARE
YOUR LAUGHTER

10:25.875 --> 10:29.083
AND A WARM CUP OF TEA
WITH A MAN WHO IS WORTHY
OF LOVING YOU IN RETURN.

10:29.083 --> 10:31.125
YOU WANT ME TO HAVE TEA
WITH A WORTHY MAN?

10:31.125 --> 10:33.291
I DON'T WANNA SEE YOU
CLOSE THE DOOR

10:33.291 --> 10:34.667
ON POSSIBILITIES,
AUDREY.

10:34.667 --> 10:36.542
I WANNA SEE YOU OPEN UP.

10:36.542 --> 10:38.583
LET THE SUNSHINE IN.

10:38.583 --> 10:40.208
OK. I'M SORRY.

10:40.208 --> 10:41.917
I WANTED TO TALK
TO JENNIFER LINDLEY.

10:41.917 --> 10:45.041
CALLER NUMBER TWO:
YOU'RE ON THE AIR.

10:46.917 --> 10:48.000
HEY, WHAT'S UP, DUDE?

10:48.000 --> 10:49.166
YOU WANNA PLAY A LITTLE
MUD FOOTBALL WITH US?

10:49.166 --> 10:51.625
OH, CAN'T.
GOT A LADY COMIN' OVER.

10:51.625 --> 10:54.250
OH, SPEAKIN' OF WHICH,
I HEARD YOU HAD
A CUTE LITTLE NUMBER

10:54.250 --> 10:56.083
OVER HERE THIS MORNING.
BLONDE, PETITE?

10:56.083 --> 10:58.125
YEAH, THAT WAS JUST JEN,
THE WALKING BUZZKILL.

10:58.125 --> 10:59.333
AND SHE'S TAKEN,
BY THE WAY.

10:59.333 --> 11:00.625
WHAT? YOU TWO HAVE
ANOTHER ARGUMENT?

11:00.625 --> 11:03.208
NAH, SHE JUST
CAME OVER TO HARASS ME
ABOUT MY GRADES.

11:03.208 --> 11:04.458
I THOUGHT
OUR MAN McPHEE

11:04.458 --> 11:05.375
WAS ON
THE HONOR ROLL
BACK IN HIGH SCHOOL.

11:05.375 --> 11:08.166
I WAS. I WAS.

11:08.166 --> 11:10.333
BUT NOW I'M ON
ACADEMIC PROBATION.

11:10.333 --> 11:11.500
WHO SAYS MEN
CAN'T CHANGE, RIGHT?

11:11.500 --> 11:13.625
DUDE, YOU'RE ON
ACADEMIC PROBATION?

11:13.625 --> 11:14.792
THAT'S NOT COOL.

11:14.792 --> 11:16.000
NO WORRIES. I'LL
MAKE IT UP THIS TERM.

11:16.000 --> 11:17.959
YEAH. YOU WILL. YOU SEE,
WE CAN'T HAVE OUR NIBS

11:17.959 --> 11:21.083
FAILING OUT
THE FIRST SEMESTER.
MAKES US LOOK BAD.

11:21.083 --> 11:24.083
I'M GONNA HAVE THE DEAN
BREATHING DOWN MY NECK,
AND I DON'T NEED THAT.

11:24.083 --> 11:26.500
I SAID I'LL MAKE IT UP, YOU
DON'T HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT IT.

11:26.500 --> 11:29.375
MAYBE YOU SHOULD BE STUDYING
INSTEAD OF PLAYIN' FOOTBALL.

11:29.375 --> 11:30.542
WE GOT A QUIZ IN SOC
COMIN' UP.

11:30.542 --> 11:31.875
I DON'T SEE
YOU STUDYING.

11:31.875 --> 11:34.583
WELL, THAT'S BECAUSE
I'M NOT ON ACADEMIC PROBATION.

11:51.625 --> 11:52.708
WHAT IS THIS?

11:52.708 --> 11:53.917
MY NEW SCRIPT.

11:53.917 --> 11:55.375
COOL. YOU WANT ME
TO READ IT?

11:55.375 --> 11:57.458
EVEN BETTER.

11:57.458 --> 11:59.208
I WANT YOU
TO DIRECT IT.

11:59.208 --> 12:00.959
OH, I CAN'T--I'M
NOT LOOKIN' FOR--

12:00.959 --> 12:03.708
NO, NO, NO. READ IT.
Professor: QUIET.

12:03.708 --> 12:04.291
THEN WE'LL TALK.

12:04.291 --> 12:06.458
ALL RIGHT.

12:06.458 --> 12:08.542
AWESOME TRAPPER KEEPER!

12:08.542 --> 12:10.083
THANKS.

12:24.000 --> 12:26.875
H-HOW DO YOU FEEL
ABOUT INDIAN FOOD?

12:26.875 --> 12:27.875
EXCUSE ME?

12:27.875 --> 12:29.166
FOR FRIDAY.

12:29.166 --> 12:30.875
SOME PEOPLE HAVE
A PROBLEM WITH CURRY.

12:30.875 --> 12:32.750
I'M NOT ONE OF THEM,
BUT IF YOU DON'T ENJOY NAAN,

12:32.750 --> 12:35.041
THEN, REALLY,
WHAT'S THE POINT?

12:35.041 --> 12:36.500
YOU ARE SO ODD.

12:36.500 --> 12:38.208
AM I TOO ODD?
NO! [LAUGHS]

12:38.208 --> 12:39.250
I'LL KEEP YOU
POSTED.

12:39.250 --> 12:40.041
YOU'RE BOTH LATE
FOR MY CLASS.

12:40.041 --> 12:42.166
SO ARE YOU.
GOOD POINT.

12:42.166 --> 12:42.708
HELLO, ELLIOT.

12:42.708 --> 12:46.041
HEY, PROFESSOR.

12:46.041 --> 12:47.917
UH, I'M GONNA
GET GOIN' NOW.

12:47.917 --> 12:50.000
OK. BYE.

12:50.000 --> 12:52.917
YOU, WAIT. I HAVE NEWS
ON THE LAZARE FRONT.

12:52.917 --> 12:54.166
UH-OH.

12:54.166 --> 12:55.750
GOOD NEWS
OR NEWS THAT MEANS

12:55.750 --> 12:57.166
I'LL BE IN THE FILES
ALL WEEKEND?

12:57.166 --> 12:59.041
OH, HOW QUICKLY
THEY TURN. WE'RE FINISHED.

12:59.041 --> 13:00.333
OR, RATHER,
YOU'RE FINISHED.

13:00.333 --> 13:02.000
I NOW PLAN ON BENEFITING
FROM THE FRUITS
OF YOUR LABOR

13:02.000 --> 13:04.750
BY GETTING PUBLISHED
IN AN OBSCURE JOURNAL

13:04.750 --> 13:06.542
THAT NO ONE,
NOT EVEN MY MOTHER,
WILL WIND UP READING.

13:06.542 --> 13:09.458
SO, WHAT DO YOU SAY?

13:09.458 --> 13:11.000
ABOUT WHAT?

13:13.333 --> 13:15.458
FOR AN ENGLISH TEACHER,
YOU DON'T TALK TOO GOOD.

13:15.458 --> 13:18.125
DINNER, FRIDAY NIGHT.
I'M TAKING YOU
ALL OUT TO CELEBRATE.

13:18.125 --> 13:19.708
WAS THAT BETTER?
MUCH.

13:19.708 --> 13:21.834
GOOD. IT'S GONNA
BE FANCY, SO WEAR
YOUR BEST JEANS.

13:21.834 --> 13:23.708
NOT A PROBLEM.
I'LL BE THERE.

13:23.708 --> 13:26.333
GREAT. AND NOW YOU'RE
OFFICIALLY LATE
FOR MY CLASS.

13:26.333 --> 13:29.000
TSK, TSK, TSK.
WHAT ARE WE GONNA DO
WITH YOU, JOEY POTTER?

13:32.834 --> 13:34.750
FRIDAY NIGHT.

13:49.792 --> 13:51.333
SO, ARE YOU
GONNA TALK
TO OLIVER TODAY?

13:51.333 --> 13:53.000
YOU'VE BEEN
PUTTIN' IT OFF
ALL WEEK.

13:53.000 --> 13:55.333
I KNOW. I KNOW.

13:55.333 --> 13:57.625
I MEAN,
IS THE SCRIPT
REALLY THAT BAD?

13:57.625 --> 14:00.542
NO. I DON'T HATE IT.
THERE'S A LOT OF REALLY
GOOD STUFF IN THERE.

14:00.542 --> 14:01.458
I HAVE A COUPLE IDEAS
HOW TO MAKE IT BETTER.

14:01.458 --> 14:03.375
NATURALLY.

14:03.375 --> 14:05.000
BUT THERE'S NO POINT
IN GETTING INTO IT,

14:05.000 --> 14:06.625
BECAUSE I'M NOT
GONNA DIRECT IT--

14:06.625 --> 14:09.000
BUT I DON'T SEE WHY,
I MEAN, IF THE SCRIPT
ISN'T BAD?

14:09.000 --> 14:10.166
IT'S NOT MY SCRIPT.

14:10.166 --> 14:11.166
I MEAN, I DON'T KNOW

14:11.166 --> 14:12.875
HOW TO DIRECT
SOMEBODY ELSE'S WORDS.

14:12.875 --> 14:14.708
I DON'T EVEN WANT TO.
I WANNA DO MY OWN STUFF.

14:14.708 --> 14:16.542
OH, THAT'S COOL.
SO, DO YOU HAVE, UM,

14:16.542 --> 14:19.750
SOME UNPRODUCED MATERIAL
LYING AROUND THAT I JUST
HAVEN'T HEARD ABOUT?

14:20.583 --> 14:22.834
THAT'S NOT THE POINT.

14:22.834 --> 14:25.125
THE POINT IS I DON'T WANNA
DIRECT ANYTHING RIGHT NOW.

14:25.125 --> 14:26.166
A PROJECT LIKE THAT
TAKES OVER YOUR LIFE,

14:26.166 --> 14:28.834
AND MY LIFE IS
JUST STARTING TO FEEL NORMAL.

14:28.834 --> 14:31.083
I'M NOT READY
TO MAKE THAT KIND OF
COMMITMENT TO A FILM.

14:31.083 --> 14:34.000
ESPECIALLY SOMEBODY ELSE'S FILM.
OH, I SEE.

14:38.542 --> 14:39.750
I KNOW WHAT YOU'RE DOIN'.

14:39.750 --> 14:42.625
I'VE BEEN TO THERAPY.
I KNOW THE TRICKS.

14:42.625 --> 14:46.417
OK. AS THE SUPPORTIVE
GIRLFRIEND, I AM
REQUIRED TO TELL YOU

14:46.417 --> 14:48.834
WHEN YOU HAVE THAT LOOK
IN YOUR EYES, AND...

14:48.834 --> 14:50.083
YOU'VE GOT A TWINKLE.

14:50.083 --> 14:52.208
OR MAYBE THAT'S JUST
'CAUSE I'M AROUND YOU.

14:52.208 --> 14:54.125
OH, NATURALLY,
I CONTRIBUTE
TO THE TWINKLE,

14:54.125 --> 14:57.458
BUT I DO NOT
TAKE FULL CREDIT
FOR THE TWINKLE.

14:57.458 --> 14:59.041
DAWSON, YOU LIKE
THIS SCRIPT,

14:59.041 --> 15:00.375
SO WHY DON'T YOU
JUST TALK TO HIM?

15:00.375 --> 15:02.000
WHY DON'T YOU
JUST SEE WHAT
HE HAS TO SAY?

15:04.542 --> 15:05.041
I'LL THINK ABOUT IT.

15:07.750 --> 15:09.083
OK, I GOTTA GO.

15:09.083 --> 15:11.208
MY PRODUCER WANTS TO TALK
TO ME BEFORE THE SHOW.

15:11.208 --> 15:11.750
OK. STILL ON
FOR LUNCH?

15:11.750 --> 15:13.458
ABSOLUTELY.

15:13.458 --> 15:16.458
COOL.

15:16.458 --> 15:18.041
[LAUGHS] COME HERE!

15:29.959 --> 15:31.750
CARPOOLING TO WORK
WAS A MISTAKE.

15:31.750 --> 15:34.667
I SEE THAT NOW.

15:34.667 --> 15:35.959
[EXHALES LOUDLY]

15:35.959 --> 15:37.917
DON'T GET YOUR PANTIES
ALL IN A BUNCH.

15:37.917 --> 15:39.792
I'M FINISHED.

15:39.792 --> 15:43.291
ANYWAY, WE CAN'T LEAVE
UNTIL WE HELP JOEY
WITH HER LITTLE DILEMMA.

15:43.291 --> 15:44.750
Pacey: WHAT DILEMMA?

15:44.750 --> 15:46.000
NOTHING.

15:46.000 --> 15:47.667
JOEY MADE 2 DATES
FOR THE SAME NIGHT.

15:47.667 --> 15:49.208
AUDREY? WHEN MY EYES
BUG OUT LIKE THIS,

15:49.208 --> 15:50.917
WHAT DOES THAT MEAN
IN YOUR WORLD?

15:50.917 --> 15:53.625
HOW VERY MARCIA BRADY
OF YOU, JO.

15:53.625 --> 15:55.542
SO, TELL ME. WHO ARE
THE LUCKY CONTESTANTS?

15:55.542 --> 15:58.083
WELL, BEHIND
DOOR NUMBER ONE,
WE HAVE NICE GUY.

15:58.083 --> 15:59.708
HIS NAME IS ELLIOT,
FOR GOD'S SAKE.

15:59.708 --> 16:01.250
A SWEET YOUNG LAD
WHO'S QUITE SMITTEN
WITH OUR JOEY.

16:01.250 --> 16:03.792
CUTE, FUNNY,
WEARS SWEATER VESTS,

16:03.792 --> 16:05.375
THE ONLY STRIKE AGAINST
HIM THUS FAR.

16:05.375 --> 16:06.583
THAT'S BAD. WHO'S
BEHIND DOOR NUMBER 2?

16:06.583 --> 16:09.083
CAN WE NOT DO THIS?
AH, YES, THE PROFESSOR.

16:09.083 --> 16:10.667
THE FORBIDDEN FRUIT,
IF YOU WILL.

16:10.667 --> 16:12.333
HE'S NOT FRUIT.
HE'S MY TEACHER,

16:12.333 --> 16:14.667
AND IT'S NOT A DATE,
IT'S AN ACADEMIC
GROUP ACTIVITY

16:14.667 --> 16:16.917
WITH THE ENTIRE--

16:16.917 --> 16:18.458
DOESN'T MEAN THAT
IT COULDN'T END UP

16:18.458 --> 16:19.917
WITH DATE-LIKE
CIRCUMSTANCES,

16:19.917 --> 16:22.125
THE TWO OF YOU
WRAPPED AROUND
EACH OTHER LIKE SQUID.

16:22.125 --> 16:23.458
OH, BEAUTIFUL IMAGE,
AUDREY,

16:23.458 --> 16:25.458
BUT NOT ONE THAT
I'M ENTERTAINING.

16:26.708 --> 16:29.542
AND IF
I WERE TO CANCEL
ON ELLIOT TONIGHT,

16:29.542 --> 16:31.875
IT WOULD
ONLY BE TO FURTHER
MY ACADEMIC CAREER.

16:31.875 --> 16:34.625
OH. HEY, NOW,
CORRECT ME
IF I'M WRONG,

16:34.625 --> 16:37.041
AREN'T YOU WAY AHEAD OF THE
CURVE ON THE ACADEMIC CAREER?

16:37.041 --> 16:39.667
ONLY THING YOU DON'T
HAVE GOIN' FOR YOU NOW
IS A SOCIAL LIFE.

16:39.667 --> 16:41.125
I HAVE
A SOCIAL LIFE.

16:42.708 --> 16:45.834
WELL, WHAT IS THIS? SOCIALIZING.

16:45.834 --> 16:47.333
LISTEN. I'M ALL FOR YOU
BEDDING DOWN

16:47.333 --> 16:48.500
WITH A GORGEOUS
PROFESSOR.

16:48.500 --> 16:50.333
OH, YEAH. BEEN THERE,
DONE THAT. IT'S GOOD.

16:50.333 --> 16:52.208
BUT, I DON'T THINK
YOU HAVE THE GUTS.

16:52.208 --> 16:55.625
WHICH IS FINE, BECAUSE
NICE GUY HAS SERIOUS
BOYFRIEND POTENTIAL.

16:55.625 --> 16:58.000
WHICH MEANS THAT
THERE'S NO REASON
NOT TO GO OUT WITH HIM.

16:58.000 --> 16:59.000
UNLESS...

16:59.000 --> 17:01.000
UNLESS...
UNLESS WHAT?

17:01.000 --> 17:03.375
WELL, UNLESS
YOU'RE NOT READY
FOR A BOYFRIEND YET.

17:06.333 --> 17:08.290
WHY WOULDN'T
I BE READY
FOR A BOYFRIEND?

17:08.290 --> 17:10.916
BOYFRIENDS ARE
TIME-CONSUMING THINGS,
AND...

17:10.916 --> 17:13.625
SOME PEOPLE THINK
THAT THEY'RE READY,
BUT THEY'RE NOT, AND...

17:13.625 --> 17:16.458
IT'S NOT JUST
GOING TO DINNER
A BUNCH OF TIMES

17:16.458 --> 17:17.834
AND GETTIN' GREASY
AFTERWARDS.

17:17.834 --> 17:19.290
IT'S NOT?
NO!

17:19.290 --> 17:22.040
IT'S LETTING
YOUR GUARD DOWN.

17:22.040 --> 17:23.375
YOU KNOW,
GETTING PAST THE SMALL TALK

17:23.375 --> 17:26.165
AND REALLY ALLOWING
YOURSELF TO BE INTIMATE

17:26.165 --> 17:27.541
WITH SOMEBODY NEW.

17:27.541 --> 17:29.458
ARE YOU SURE THAT
YOU'RE READY TO DO THAT?

17:29.458 --> 17:31.875
YES. 100% READY.

17:31.875 --> 17:33.417
OK. GREAT.

17:33.417 --> 17:37.041
THEN I GUESS
YOU'LL BE GOING OUT
WITH NICE GUY TONIGHT.

17:37.041 --> 17:39.917
OK.
Pacey: LET'S GO.

17:48.875 --> 17:50.000
HEY, McPHEE!

17:50.000 --> 17:51.041
HEY.

17:51.041 --> 17:52.625
SO, WHAT DID I MISS?

17:52.625 --> 17:54.500
NOT MUCH. WE GOT
OUR QUIZZES BACK.

17:54.500 --> 17:57.041
OH, YEAH?
HOW'D YOU DO?

17:57.041 --> 17:59.375
OH, NICE! NICE!

17:59.375 --> 18:01.041
YEAH. GLAD
YOU APPROVE.

18:01.041 --> 18:03.500
HEY. LOOK, I DIDN'T
MEAN TO GET ALL UP
IN YOUR FACE BEFORE.

18:03.500 --> 18:04.917
I WAS JUST
LOOKIN' OUT FOR YOU.

18:04.917 --> 18:06.291
YOU KNOW I GOT
YOUR BACK?

18:06.291 --> 18:08.667
REALLY? 'CAUSE IT DIDN'T FEEL
LIKE YOU HAD MY BACK.

18:08.667 --> 18:09.542
IT FELT MORE LIKE
YOU WERE ON IT.

18:09.542 --> 18:11.708
YOU TOOK IT
WRONG, THEN.

18:11.708 --> 18:14.041
HEY, HOW 'BOUT
WE DO IT UP RIGHT
TONIGHT? YOU KNOW?

18:14.041 --> 18:15.583
CELEBRATE
YOUR ACCOMPLISHMENT.

18:15.583 --> 18:16.375
WHAT DO YOU SAY?

18:16.375 --> 18:17.792
YEAH. ALL RIGHT.
SOUNDS GOOD.

18:17.792 --> 18:20.333
ALL RIGHT? LET'S GO
TELL THE BOYS.
YEAH. ALL RIGHT.

18:20.333 --> 18:25.125
Professor: AND, UH, WHOEVER
CHECKED OUT FEAR AND DESIRE
FROM THE VIDEO LIBRARY,

18:25.125 --> 18:30.166
WOULD THEY PLEASE RETURN IT
SO OTHERS CAN FINISH
THEIR PAPERS? MMM?

18:30.166 --> 18:31.250
IT WAS A GIFT.

18:31.250 --> 18:32.834
Professor: I'LL SEE YOU
ON MONDAY.

18:36.291 --> 18:38.083
DID YOU READ
MY SCRIPT YET?

18:38.083 --> 18:39.667
OLIVER. UM...YEAH.

18:39.667 --> 18:42.000
GREAT!

18:43.959 --> 18:46.083
I HAVE A, UH, PRELIMINARY
SHOOTING SCHEDULE HERE.

18:46.083 --> 18:47.166
IT'S FLEXIBLE.

18:47.166 --> 18:49.291
YOU KNOW, OLIVER.
I CAN'T DO IT.

18:49.291 --> 18:51.667
I'M SORRY.

18:51.667 --> 18:54.041
Y-YOU CAN'T DO IT? WHY?

18:54.041 --> 18:55.166
HOW? Y-YOU HAVE
TO DO IT, DAWSON.

18:55.166 --> 18:56.834
Y-YOU'RE THE ONLY ONE
WHO CAN DO IT.

18:56.834 --> 18:59.166
I'M FLATTERED,

18:59.166 --> 19:01.667
BUT, UH, IT--

19:01.667 --> 19:02.291
IT'S COMPLICATED.

19:02.291 --> 19:04.583
WHAT? TH-THE STORY?

19:04.583 --> 19:05.583
IT'S SUPPOSED TO BE.

19:05.583 --> 19:07.208
DID YOU NOT UNDERSTAND
THE FLASHBACKS?

19:07.208 --> 19:08.125
W-W-WERE THEY NOT
CLEAR ENOUGH, OR--

19:08.125 --> 19:10.917
NO, THAT'S NOT
WHAT I MEANT.

19:10.917 --> 19:12.333
UM...

19:13.917 --> 19:15.083
ALTHOUGH,
THE FLASHBACKS I...

19:15.083 --> 19:17.333
DON'T THINK
YOU NEED.

19:17.333 --> 19:18.667
YOU'RE USIN' THEM
AS A CRUTCH.

19:18.667 --> 19:20.708
I THINK YOU CAN
TELL THE STORY
WITHOUT THEM.

19:21.792 --> 19:23.542
WAS THAT A NOTE?

19:23.542 --> 19:25.959
SURE.

19:25.959 --> 19:26.792
DO YOU HAVE...

19:26.792 --> 19:29.667
NOTES ON MY SCRIPT?

19:29.667 --> 19:31.417
A FEW. YEAH.

19:33.500 --> 19:34.834
ALL RIGHT.

19:34.834 --> 19:35.917
LET'S GO.

19:35.917 --> 19:37.583
WHERE?
LUNCH.

19:37.583 --> 19:39.667
OK. I'VE GOT PLANS
WITH MY GIRLFRIEND,
SO--

19:39.667 --> 19:41.291
AND BRING YOUR NOTES.

19:43.750 --> 19:45.667
ALL RIGHT.

19:45.667 --> 19:47.792
THIS IS COMPLETELY
UNBELIEVABLE.

19:47.792 --> 19:51.375
YEAH, I KNOW.
IF DANNY FOUND YOU
IN HERE, I'D BE FIRED.

19:51.375 --> 19:53.834
HOW CAN
THEY THINK THAT
I'VE LOST MY EDGE?

19:53.834 --> 19:55.500
I AM NOTHING
BUT EDGE, PACEY.

19:55.500 --> 19:56.500
I AM RAZOR SHARP,
BABY.

19:56.500 --> 19:59.542
AND YET HERE YOU ARE,
EATING GARNISH.

19:59.542 --> 20:00.834
SO, WHAT'S THE PROBLEM?

20:00.834 --> 20:02.542
I DON'T KNOW.
MY PRODUCER
CALLED ME IN

20:02.542 --> 20:04.792
AND TOLD ME THAT
MY SHOWS THIS WEEK
HAVE BEEN TERRIBLE.

20:04.792 --> 20:07.000
AND THAT IF
I DON'T GO BACK
TO DOING THINGS

20:07.000 --> 20:08.083
THE WAY I WAS
DOING THEM BEFORE,

20:08.083 --> 20:08.834
THAT THEY'RE
GONNA CANCEL ME.

20:08.834 --> 20:11.000
BEFORE WHAT?

20:11.000 --> 20:12.458
I DON'T KNOW BEFORE WHAT.
BEFORE...

20:15.458 --> 20:16.959
ME AND DAWSON.

20:16.959 --> 20:19.375
AH. AND THE CLOUDS PART.

20:19.375 --> 20:21.834
BUT THAT MAKES
ABSOLUTELY NO SENSE,

20:21.834 --> 20:23.834
BECAUSE I WAS
MISERABLE THEN,
I'M HAPPY NOW.

20:23.834 --> 20:26.500
IT MAKES PERFECT SENSE
TO ME. NOBODY LIKES
HAPPY PEOPLE.

20:26.500 --> 20:28.208
IF YOU
HAD A RELATIONSHIP
QUESTION,

20:28.208 --> 20:30.291
WOULDN'T YOU RATHER
TALK TO SOMEBODY
WHO WAS IN...

20:30.291 --> 20:32.125
A HEALTHY, LOVING
RELATIONSHIP?

20:32.125 --> 20:33.291
HELL, NO. I PREFER
TO GET MY ADVICE

20:33.291 --> 20:35.625
FROM PEOPLE WHO ARE
MORE DYSFUNCTIONAL THAN I AM.

20:35.625 --> 20:37.166
THAT WAY I FEEL GOOD
ABOUT MY LIFE.

20:37.166 --> 20:38.667
FINE. FINE.

20:38.667 --> 20:40.291
OK. IF THAT'S WHAT
THE PEOPLE WANT,

20:40.291 --> 20:42.041
IF THEY WANT ME
TO BE NASTY
AND SARCASTIC,

20:42.041 --> 20:43.708
I CAN DO THAT.

20:43.708 --> 20:45.375
I JUST NEED
SOMETHING THAT'S
GONNA TAKE ME THERE.

20:47.708 --> 20:49.291
PACEY, SAY SOMETHING
DISGUSTING.

20:49.291 --> 20:51.542
SURE, WOULD
YOU PREFER SEXIST

20:51.542 --> 20:52.667
OR JUST DOWNRIGHT VULGAR?

20:52.667 --> 20:54.458
[CELL PHONE RINGS]
HOLD THAT THOUGHT.

20:56.041 --> 20:58.250
HELLO.

21:00.917 --> 21:03.917
HELLO,
MY LITTLE PUMPKIN.

21:03.917 --> 21:06.708
OH, YOU ARE SO FIRED.

21:12.083 --> 21:14.041
[KNOCK ON DOOR]

21:18.250 --> 21:19.417
HEY.

21:19.417 --> 21:21.417
I WAS WONDERING
IF 7:00's TOO EARLY.

21:21.417 --> 21:22.708
I KNOW WE SAID 7:30,

21:22.708 --> 21:24.792
BUT I WAS AFRAID
WE MIGHT MISS
THE MOVIE.

21:26.417 --> 21:28.417
ACTUALLY, ELLIOT,
I WAS...

21:28.417 --> 21:29.875
I WAS JUST
ABOUT TO CALL YOU.

21:29.875 --> 21:31.792
IS EVERYTHING OK?

21:31.792 --> 21:33.625
EVERYTHING'S FINE. UM...

21:33.625 --> 21:37.375
I THINK I MIGHT BE
COMING DOWN WITH SOMETHING.

21:39.041 --> 21:40.708
OH.

21:41.708 --> 21:44.417
AND I WANTED TO WAIT
AND SEE HOW I FELT,

21:44.417 --> 21:47.291
YOU KNOW, BECAUSE I
REALLY WANTED TO GO TONIGHT.

21:47.291 --> 21:49.625
RIGHT. OF COURSE.
BUT MY--

21:49.625 --> 21:52.667
MY THROAT'S
ALL SCRATCHY AND...

21:52.667 --> 21:55.125
WELL...
I DON'T WANT YOU TO GET SICK.

21:55.125 --> 21:56.708
AND I DON'T
WANNA GET YOU SICK.

21:56.708 --> 21:59.041
YEAH. THAT, TOO.

22:03.583 --> 22:06.667
SO, ANYWAY, I--I THINK
IT WOULD BE BETTER IF I...

22:06.667 --> 22:09.750
STAYED HOME
AND WENT TO BED EARLY.

22:09.750 --> 22:11.959
YEAH. THAT'S DEFINITELY
THE RIGHT THING TO DO.

22:13.417 --> 22:15.917
I'M SORRY
THIS IS SO LAST-MINUTE.

22:15.917 --> 22:19.041
YOU COULDN'T
HAVE KNOWN YOU WERE
GONNA GET SICK, RIGHT?

22:19.041 --> 22:23.667
YOU SHOULD
GET SOME REST AND
DRINK PLENTY OF FLUIDS.

22:23.667 --> 22:26.041
MAYBE WE CAN DO IT AGAIN
SOME OTHER TIME
OR SOMETHING.

22:26.041 --> 22:27.917
ABSOLUTELY.

22:27.917 --> 22:29.000
OK.

22:29.000 --> 22:30.667
GREAT. WELL...

BUT I REALLY
LIKE THOSE SHOES.

23:28.208 --> 23:29.875
OK, THOSE
AREN'T MINE.

23:29.875 --> 23:33.583
I HAVE LOST MY EDGE.
I AM ABOUT TO LOSE MY SHOW,
AND IT'S ALL YOUR FAULT.

23:33.583 --> 23:35.375
HOW, EXACTLY?

23:35.375 --> 23:36.542
WELL, BECAUSE--

23:36.542 --> 23:37.875
BECAUSE YOU MADE ME HAPPY,
AND NOW I'M BORING.

TO DINNER WITH US.

SPENT ALL DAY WITH HIM.

23:53.166 --> 23:54.667
I KNOW. I KNOW.

23:54.667 --> 23:55.750
BUT WE HAVEN'T
REALLY GONE OVER
THE NOTES.

THROUGH HALF THE SCRIPT.

TO FORGET ABOUT IT.

SOME SLACK HERE.

OF A ROUGH WEEK, HUH?

A SECRET AMONG BROTHERS, RIGHT?

HARD FOR YOU GUYS

ABOUT YOUR FRIENDS.

25:47.792 --> 25:50.542
FOR YOUR REAL
FRIDAY NIGHT FUN?

25:50.542 --> 25:52.708
OH, YOU THOUGHT
WHEN YOU SUGGESTED
DINNER AT 6:00

25:52.708 --> 25:53.708
THAT I
WOULDN'T GET IT?

25:53.708 --> 25:57.625
YEAH. OK, GO. GO.

WHERE ARE YOU OFF TO
THIS FINE EVENING?

OH, NOWHERE.
JUST BACK TO

OH. WELL, THEN YOU'RE
WALKING IN MY DIRECTION.

26:12.542 --> 26:14.041
NO, YOU'RE WRONG.

26:14.041 --> 26:17.708
I FINISHED IT
IN ONE SITTING.
THAT MUST MEAN SOMETHING.

26:17.708 --> 26:20.000
YEAH,
IT MEANS I WROTE
A BATHROOM BOOK.

26:20.000 --> 26:22.542
YOU'LL FINISH IT
BEFORE YOU FLUSH.

26:22.542 --> 26:27.750
I'M SERIOUS. I THOUGHT
IT WAS HONEST AND COMPLEX.

26:27.750 --> 26:31.250
OK, MAYBE NOT COMPLEX.
BUT RIVETING.

26:31.250 --> 26:32.417
I MEAN, ESPECIALLY
THE PART ABOUT THE GIRL.

26:32.417 --> 26:35.208
THAT...THAT WAS BEAUTIFUL.

26:35.208 --> 26:38.458
ACTUALLY, THAT'S
MY FAVORITE PART.

26:38.458 --> 26:40.166
WAS SHE BASED
ON A REAL PERSON?

26:40.166 --> 26:43.917
BECAUSE I FIGURED OUT
WHICH ONE OF THE GUYS IS YOU.
YOU'RE MICHAEL, RIGHT?

26:43.917 --> 26:45.875
YEAH.
WHAT GAVE IT AWAY?

26:45.875 --> 26:49.583
OH, RIGHT.
THAT WOULD BE
THE BAD WRITING.

26:49.583 --> 26:51.583
IT'S NOT RELEVANT
TO THE STORY.

26:51.583 --> 26:53.083
HOW CAN YOU SAY
IT'S NOT RELEVANT?

26:53.083 --> 26:55.125
IT EXPLAINS WHY
SHE'S AFRAID TO BE LOVED.

26:55.125 --> 26:57.000
IT'S CALLED BACK STORY. HELLO?
IT'S CALLED UNNECESSARY. YOU

26:57.000 --> 26:59.834

OVER THE HEAD WITH SUBTEXT.

YOU DON'T EVEN LIKE THE ENDING.

27:02.417 --> 27:04.583
I LIKE THE ENDING.
I'M JUST NOT CONVINCED
IT'S THE BEST WAY TO GO.

27:04.583 --> 27:06.667
IT'S ACTUALLY NOT THE BEST--

27:06.667 --> 27:08.291
YOU SAID YOU WOULD
THINK ABOUT IT.

27:08.291 --> 27:09.917
I THOUGHT ABOUT IT,
AND IT'S A BAD IDEA.

27:09.917 --> 27:11.708
WHEN DID YOU
THINK ABOUT THAT?

27:11.708 --> 27:13.667
WOULD ANYBODY
CARE TO SPLIT
A SUNDAE WITH ME?

27:13.667 --> 27:15.750
ANYBODY?

27:15.750 --> 27:17.792
NO. IT WAS JUST--
IT FELT LIKE YOU.

27:17.792 --> 27:21.792
SORT OF DRY
AND SELF-DEPRECATING.
I LIKED HIM.

27:21.792 --> 27:23.041
IN THE BOOK, I MEAN.

27:23.041 --> 27:27.041
BUT THE GIRL, SHE'S NOT
HOW I PICTURED HER AT ALL.

27:27.041 --> 27:28.458
NOT HOW YOU
PICTURED WHO?

27:28.458 --> 27:30.708
YOUR WIFE.

27:30.708 --> 27:33.375
I DON'T HAVE A WIFE.

27:33.375 --> 27:36.625
YOU--I REMEMBER
YOU TOLD ME YOU HAD
A WIFE AND KID.

27:36.625 --> 27:39.250
DID I?

27:39.250 --> 27:40.875
I MUST HAVE BEEN
TRYING TO RATIONALIZE

27:40.875 --> 27:41.792
SOME BAD BEHAVIOR
AT THE TIME.

27:41.792 --> 27:44.125
I USE THE WIFE
AND KID BIT

27:44.125 --> 27:45.417
TO GET ME OUT OF THINGS
I DON'T WANNA DO.

27:45.417 --> 27:48.166
YOU'RE SERIOUS?

27:48.166 --> 27:50.041
YOU JUST LIE?

27:50.041 --> 27:51.667
NO, I DON'T LIE.
I, UH,

27:51.667 --> 27:53.708
I CREATE CHARACTERS.

27:56.041 --> 27:57.166
SO, WHAT ABOUT
THE GIRL IN THE BOOK?

27:57.166 --> 28:00.166
OR IS SHE JUST ANOTHER
MADE-UP CHARACTER?

28:00.166 --> 28:02.708
NO, SANDRINE
WAS VERY REAL.

28:02.708 --> 28:05.834
DID YOU
LOVE HER?

28:05.834 --> 28:06.583
YES, I DID.

28:06.583 --> 28:09.375
WHY'D YOU BREAK UP?

28:09.375 --> 28:12.250
GOD, A MILLION REASONS.
I DON'T KNOW.

28:12.250 --> 28:13.750
SHE WAS CRAZY,

28:13.750 --> 28:17.375
WHICH IS EXACTLY
WHAT YOU WANT WHEN YOU'RE 21.

28:17.375 --> 28:20.834
YOU STOP WANTING THAT
AS YOU GET OLDER.

28:23.542 --> 28:26.542
WHAT DO YOU WANT
WHEN YOU GET OLDER?

28:30.542 --> 28:32.083
COFFEE.

28:32.083 --> 28:33.875
YOU WANT COFFEE.

28:34.625 --> 28:36.959
YOU WANNA GET SOME COFFEE?

28:39.500 --> 28:41.708
IF YOU'RE NOT GONNA
BE OPEN TO ANYTHING
I SAY--

28:41.708 --> 28:43.667
I WOULD BE OPEN IF
I THOUGHT YOU WERE BEING OPEN.

28:43.667 --> 28:46.375
I'D BE OPEN IF I THOUGHT
YOU WERE RIGHT. OL--

28:46.375 --> 28:48.250
OLIVER, YOU'RE
TOO CLOSE TO IT.

28:48.250 --> 28:51.208
OK, YOU KNOW WHAT?
THIS ISN'T WORKING.

28:51.208 --> 28:52.917
I'M GONNA HAVE
TO LET YOU GO.

28:52.917 --> 28:55.458
YOU'RE FIRING ME?

28:55.458 --> 28:56.667
IF THAT'S THE WAY
YOU WANNA CALL IT.

28:56.667 --> 28:57.875
YOU CAN'T FIRE ME.
OLIVER, I NEVER AGREED

28:57.875 --> 29:00.792
TO DO YOUR MOVIE
IN THE--

29:06.041 --> 29:08.625
CAN YOU
BELIEVE THAT GUY?

29:15.625 --> 29:17.667
SO, WHAT ABOUT YOU?
I SEEM TO RECALL

29:17.667 --> 29:20.250
A CERTAIN STORY
ABOUT A CERTAIN BOY.

29:20.250 --> 29:21.041
WHAT HAPPENED THERE?

29:21.041 --> 29:23.959
NOTHING.
HE MET SOMEONE ELSE,

29:23.959 --> 29:27.959
OR RE-MET HER,
AS THE CASE MAY BE.

29:27.959 --> 29:30.583
ANYWAY, IT'S OVER.

29:30.583 --> 29:31.792
WE'RE OVER.

29:31.792 --> 29:33.208
I'M SORRY
TO HEAR ABOUT THAT.

29:33.208 --> 29:34.417
WHAT CAN YOU DO?

29:34.417 --> 29:37.458
START DATING,
I GUESS.

29:37.458 --> 29:38.375
I GUESS.

29:38.375 --> 29:42.667
I MEAN,
I'M TRYING TO, BUT...

29:42.667 --> 29:44.417
BUT WHAT?

29:44.417 --> 29:45.750
IT'S JUST HARD.

29:45.750 --> 29:48.417
I MEAN, IT TAKES
ALL THIS ENERGY AND EFFORT,

29:48.417 --> 29:49.834
AND YOU HAVE
NO WAY OF KNOWING

29:49.834 --> 29:52.500
THAT IT'S GOING TO BE WORTH IT
AT THE END OF THE DAY.

29:52.500 --> 29:54.125
NO, YOU DON'T.

29:54.125 --> 29:55.500
SO WHAT'S THE POINT?

29:55.500 --> 29:57.417
THERE'S NO POINT.
YOU SHOULD
PROBABLY QUIT.

29:57.417 --> 29:59.792
JOIN A CONVENT.
YOU'D LOOK GOOD
IN A HABIT.

29:59.792 --> 30:01.458
THANK YOU.

30:01.458 --> 30:02.375
YOU KNOW,
YOU THINK I'M KIDDING,

30:02.375 --> 30:04.291
THAT'S
A VERY APPEALING NOTION.

30:04.291 --> 30:05.583
COME ON. AND GIVE UP

30:05.583 --> 30:07.750
ALL THOSE
FIRST CRUSH
BUTTERFLIES? NEVER.

30:07.750 --> 30:11.125
YEAH, BUT THAT'S JUST IT.

30:11.125 --> 30:14.375
I MEAN, THE BUTTERFLIES
NEVER SEEM TO ACCOMPANY
THE RIGHT PEOPLE, YOU KNOW?

30:14.375 --> 30:16.208
THE NICE GUYS
WHO ARE RIGHT FOR YOU,

30:16.208 --> 30:18.208
THEY NEVER MAKE
YOUR STOMACH GO FLIP-FLOP.

30:18.208 --> 30:21.208
SO, WHO GIVES YOU
FLIP-FLOPS, JOEY POTTER?

30:23.750 --> 30:26.542
PEOPLE WHO SHOULDN'T.

30:26.542 --> 30:28.333
WELL, THAT HARDLY
SEEMS FAIR.

30:38.542 --> 30:41.834
NOPE. NOT FAIR AT ALL.

30:59.500 --> 31:01.834
OH. OK. OH, WOW.

31:01.834 --> 31:03.166
I'M GONNA GO
TO PRISON, AREN'T I?

31:03.166 --> 31:05.417
NO. NO. UM, IT'S OK.

31:05.417 --> 31:07.333
I THINK WE CAN
LEAVE THE FEDS
OUT OF THIS ONE.

31:07.333 --> 31:09.291
I THINK I MAY
HAVE EVEN BEEN
AN ACCOMPLICE.

31:09.291 --> 31:10.667
YOU WERE?
OK. THANK GOD.

31:10.667 --> 31:12.083
BUT I SHOULD GO.

31:12.083 --> 31:13.667
YEAH. GREAT IDEA.
LET'S GO.

31:13.667 --> 31:15.041
UH, MAYBE
I SHOULD
GO FIRST.

31:15.041 --> 31:17.750
YES, YOU SHOULD GO.
AND THEN I'LL GO LATER.

31:17.750 --> 31:19.375
TO MY HOUSE.
AND YOU'LL GO
TO YOUR HOUSE.

31:19.375 --> 31:21.208
DORM.

31:21.208 --> 31:23.208
DORM. RIGHT.
AND I'LL GO TO MY HOUSE.

31:23.208 --> 31:24.250
OK.

31:31.834 --> 31:33.458
GOOD NIGHT, PROFESSOR.

31:35.166 --> 31:36.291
GOOD NIGHT.

31:58.500 --> 32:01.750
YOU SEE, McPHEE.

32:01.750 --> 32:05.291
IF YOU WALK THE LINE
BETWEEN PARTYING AND STUDYING,

32:05.291 --> 32:08.125
MAINTAIN THE BALANCE,
IT'S ALL GOOD.

32:08.125 --> 32:11.708
OH, GEE, BLOSSOM.
YOUR CONCERN
FOR MY WELL-BEING

32:11.708 --> 32:13.417
IS SO TOUCHING
I THINK I'M GONNA CRY.

32:15.208 --> 32:16.417
WHAT'S THE PROBLEM NOW?

32:16.417 --> 32:18.041
I THOUGHT WE WERE
HAVING A NICE TIME.

32:18.041 --> 32:19.166
WE ARE, MAN.
I MEAN, WE'RE
BEST BUDS, RIGHT?

32:19.166 --> 32:22.583
TILL I SLIP UP
AND DO SOMETHING

32:22.583 --> 32:25.041
TO EMBARRASS THE MIGHTY
SIGMA EPSILON.

32:25.041 --> 32:26.750
LIKE FAIL A COUPLE
CLASSES, RIGHT, GUYS?

32:26.750 --> 32:28.417
I DON'T KNOW
WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT.

32:28.417 --> 32:30.542
YOU DON'T CARE ABOUT
MY TROUBLES. YOU CARE ABOUT

32:30.542 --> 32:32.291
HOW IT AFFECTS THE HOUSE.
DAMN STRAIGHT.

32:32.291 --> 32:33.417
THAT'S HOW IT'S
GONNA BE?

32:33.417 --> 32:35.083
THAT'S HOW
IT'S ALWAYS BEEN.

32:35.083 --> 32:37.750
THE HOUSE COMES FIRST.

32:37.750 --> 32:39.250
WHAT,
YOU DIDN'T GET THAT?

32:39.250 --> 32:40.333
I GUESS NOT.

32:40.333 --> 32:42.333
WELL, DON'T GO GETTING
ALL EMOTIONAL ON ME,

32:42.333 --> 32:44.125
YOUR EYES WELLING UP
AND WHATNOT.

32:44.125 --> 32:46.291
MAN, IT'S LIKE
TALKING TO A CHICK.

32:50.417 --> 32:52.625
YOU WANNA SAY THAT
TO MY FACE? HUH?

32:54.125 --> 32:55.375
STEP BACK, MAN.

32:55.375 --> 32:56.458
COME ON, JACK.
HE'S JUST MESSING WITH YOU.

32:56.458 --> 32:57.875
WHAT, YOU'RE GONNA
TAKE HIS SIDE?

32:57.875 --> 32:58.959
HUH, ERIC? ALL YOU GUYS?

32:58.959 --> 33:01.458
ARE YOU GONNA
SIDE WITH HIM?

33:01.458 --> 33:03.333
WHAT'S GOIN' ON HERE?
CAN I GET YOU A CUP OF COFFEE?

33:03.333 --> 33:05.792
I CAN'T BELIEVE I NEVER REALIZED
WHAT A JACKASS YOU ARE.

33:05.792 --> 33:06.750
YOU HAVE BEEN A
DISAPPOINTMENT ALL AROUND.

33:06.750 --> 33:08.917
YEAH, HOW'S THAT?

33:08.917 --> 33:10.834
YOU WERE SUPPOSED
TO HELP US CLEAN UP OUR IMAGE.

33:10.834 --> 33:13.500
AS IT TURNS OUT,
YOU'VE DONE NOTHING
BUT MAKE IT WORSE.

33:13.500 --> 33:15.625
IT WASN'T EVEN WORTH
BRINGING YOU INTO THE HOUSE.

33:15.625 --> 33:17.792
Pacey: WHOA!

33:17.792 --> 33:21.125
HEY! HEY! HEY!

33:24.875 --> 33:26.291
COME ON, NOW!

33:26.291 --> 33:27.792
GET OFF ME, PACE!

33:31.667 --> 33:33.500
COME HERE. COME HERE.

33:33.500 --> 33:34.000
DAMN IT!

33:34.000 --> 33:34.834
JESUS CHRIST.

33:34.834 --> 33:37.500
LET'S GO, GUYS.

33:37.500 --> 33:38.000
OH, MY GOD.

33:38.000 --> 33:38.917
OH, MY GOD.

33:38.917 --> 33:40.542
TAKE A SEAT RIGHT NOW.

33:40.542 --> 33:42.625
OH, MY GOD.

33:42.625 --> 33:43.291
PUT SOME
PRESSURE ON THAT.

33:43.291 --> 33:43.959
OH, MY GOD.
OK?

33:43.959 --> 33:47.000
OK. OK.
OH, MY GOD.

33:47.000 --> 33:48.458
OH, MY GOD.

34:42.250 --> 34:43.333
[KNOCK ON DOOR]

34:47.750 --> 34:49.458
SO,
I'VE BEEN THINKING
ABOUT LAST NIGHT.

34:49.458 --> 34:52.041
I THINK I COULD'VE
HANDLED THAT BETTER.

34:52.041 --> 34:54.583
YEAH?

34:54.583 --> 34:56.000
YEAH.

34:56.000 --> 34:58.417
I MEAN, POOR OLIVER.
THE GUY WAS
REALLY UPSET.

34:58.417 --> 34:59.333
GRANTED,
HE'S OBNOXIOUS.

34:59.333 --> 35:01.917
WELL, THAT'S
AN UNDERSTATEMENT.

35:01.917 --> 35:03.500
BUT HE'S GOT
A REALLY UNIQUE VOICE,

35:03.500 --> 35:05.917
AND HE'S OBVIOUSLY
VERY PASSIONATE
ABOUT THE SCRIPT.

35:05.917 --> 35:09.041
WHICH IS
A GOOD THING, YOU KNOW?
THAT'S HOW I WOULD BE.

35:09.041 --> 35:11.083
ACTUALLY, HE KIND OF
REMINDS ME OF ME
A LITTLE BIT.

35:11.083 --> 35:13.917
REMEMBER HOW I USED TO BE?
UH-HUH.

35:13.917 --> 35:15.083
WHEN I WAS DOING
THE BROOKS MOVIE

35:15.083 --> 35:17.417
AND THE ONE BEFORE THAT.
AND THE ONE BEFORE THAT.

35:17.417 --> 35:18.458
YEAH.

35:18.458 --> 35:21.750
WHICH MADE ME REALIZE,
I THINK I AM

35:21.750 --> 35:24.375
READY TO DIRECT
SOMEBODY ELSE'S WORDS.

35:24.375 --> 35:26.750
YOU KNOW, I'VE DONE
MY OWN THING
ENOUGH TIMES,

35:26.750 --> 35:29.458
I THINK THIS WOULD
BE AN ENTIRELY NEW
CHALLENGE FOR ME.

35:29.458 --> 35:31.375
MM-HMM.

35:31.375 --> 35:32.875
I THINK I SHOULD
APOLOGIZE TO HIM.

35:32.875 --> 35:34.458
HMM.

35:34.458 --> 35:35.792
ARE YOU MAD AT ME?

35:35.792 --> 35:37.917
WELL, CONGRATULATIONS TO YOU.
DING! DING! DING!

35:37.917 --> 35:39.792
I'VE BEEN
PISSED OFF AT YOU
SINCE LAST NIGHT.

35:39.792 --> 35:41.208
YOU HAVE?

35:41.208 --> 35:42.500
YES. FIRST, YOU TOTALLY
DITCH ME FOR OUR LUNCH DATE,

35:42.500 --> 35:45.542
THEN YOU INVITE
DENNIS THE MENACE
ALONG TO DINNER,

35:45.542 --> 35:47.458
WHICH IS INFRINGING
ON OUR PERSONAL TIME,

35:47.458 --> 35:49.000
WHICH IS PRECIOUS,
DON'T YOU THINK?

35:49.000 --> 35:50.500
IT ABSOLUTELY IS.

35:50.500 --> 35:52.250
AND THEN YOU LET
THAT LOUD-MOUTH WEASEL

35:52.250 --> 35:53.375
TREAT ME LIKE
I'M A PIECE OF ARM CANDY.

35:53.375 --> 35:56.208
NEITHER ONE OF YOU
LISTENED TO A SINGLE THING

35:56.208 --> 35:58.083
THAT I HAD TO SAY,
AND YOU HAVE TO ADMIT,

35:58.083 --> 35:59.625
I AM RIGHT
ABOUT THAT FIRST SEX SCENE

35:59.625 --> 36:00.792
BEING TOTALLY GRATUITOUS.

36:00.792 --> 36:01.792
IT IS JUST
AN EXCUSE FOR OLIVER

36:01.792 --> 36:03.792
TO LOOK AT A PAIR OF BOOBS
IN THE FLESH.

36:03.792 --> 36:07.834
WHY DON'T YOU GIVE HIM $20
AND TELL HIM TO GET A LAP DANCE?

36:07.834 --> 36:10.834
JEN, I AM SO SORRY.

36:10.834 --> 36:12.208
OH, MY GOD! IT'S BACK!

36:12.208 --> 36:13.500
I GOTTA GO!

36:13.500 --> 36:15.000
WHAT'S BACK?

36:17.333 --> 36:18.291
I FORGIVE YOU.

36:23.542 --> 36:24.792
I DID IT, JOEY.

36:24.792 --> 36:26.542
I'M A YOGI MASTER.
I AM CENTERED,
I AM BALANCED.

36:26.542 --> 36:29.458
NOTHING CAN PENETRATE
MY INNER SOURCE OF CALM.

36:31.500 --> 36:32.333
AUDREY, I KISSED WILDER
LAST NIGHT

36:32.333 --> 36:34.250
AND JUST
DUMPED NICE GUY.

36:34.250 --> 36:35.708
WHOA. OK. OW.

36:35.708 --> 36:38.333
THAT WASN'T FAIR.
ME AND ELLIOT WEREN'T GOING OUT,

36:38.333 --> 36:40.667
SO TECHNICALLY,
IT WASN'T A DUMP,

36:40.667 --> 36:42.041
BUT I GAVE HIM
BACK HIS NYQUIL.

36:42.041 --> 36:44.000
WAIT, LET'S JUST
REWIND HERE TO THE KISS.

36:44.000 --> 36:46.875
WHAT HAPPENED?
AND MORE IMPORTANTLY,
WAS THERE TONGUE INVOLVED?

36:46.875 --> 36:49.333
WELL, WE KISSED.
I PULLED AWAY.
END OF STORY.

36:49.333 --> 36:50.542
EVERY OTHER GIRL
ON CAMPUS

36:50.542 --> 36:51.917
WOULD HAVE
SLEPT WITH HIM.

36:51.917 --> 36:54.041
WAIT. ARE YOU SAYING YOU WANTED
TO SLEEP WITH HIM?

36:54.041 --> 36:55.375
NO.

36:55.375 --> 36:57.500
I DON'T KNOW.

36:57.500 --> 36:59.458
BUT I JUST--
I DIDN'T WANT
TO STOP KISSING HIM.

36:59.458 --> 37:00.917
SO WHY DID YOU?

37:00.917 --> 37:03.125
BECAUSE I FREAKED OUT.
I GOT SCARED
LIKE I ALWAYS DO.

37:03.125 --> 37:04.208
OK. THAT HAPPENS.

37:04.208 --> 37:06.125
YEAH, BUT, AUDREY,
I'M SICK OF IT.

37:06.125 --> 37:08.875
I MEAN, I CAME
TO WORTHINGTON
TO CHANGE MY LIFE

37:08.875 --> 37:10.333
AND TO BECOME
A DIFFERENT PERSON.

37:10.333 --> 37:12.166
AND WHAT HAPPENED?

37:12.166 --> 37:13.375
MY STUPID LIFE
FOLLOWED ME HERE.

37:13.375 --> 37:15.125
YUP. WELL, THAT
WAS AN UNFORTUNATE
TURN OF EVENTS.

37:15.125 --> 37:17.792
AND I'M TRAPPED.

37:17.792 --> 37:19.792
I MEAN, I CAN'T QUITE
WIPE THE SLATE CLEAN

37:19.792 --> 37:22.875
BECAUSE, YOU KNOW,
IF I PRETEND
TO BE SOMEBODY NEW,

37:22.875 --> 37:24.208
EVERYBODY
ALREADY KNOWS ME HERE.

37:24.208 --> 37:26.834
WHY DO YOU HAVE
TO BE SOMEBODY NEW?

37:26.834 --> 37:29.750
IF YOU WEREN'T YOU,
WE MIGHT NOT BE FRIENDS.

37:29.750 --> 37:32.208
YEAH, BUT...

37:33.792 --> 37:35.291
WELL, GOOD POINT.

37:35.291 --> 37:37.875
THINK ABOUT THIS, JOEY.

37:37.875 --> 37:40.417
THESE OPPORTUNITIES THAT
KEEP PRESENTING THEMSELVES,

37:40.417 --> 37:42.583
THEY'RE PRESENTING
THEMSELVES TO YOU,
NOT TO ME.

37:42.583 --> 37:44.375
NOT TO ANYBODY ELSE.

37:44.375 --> 37:47.750
AND ALL YOU HAVE TO DO
IS JUST SEIZE THEM.

37:47.750 --> 37:49.083
STOP WASTING YOUR TIME

37:49.083 --> 37:51.500
WISHING THAT
YOU WERE SOMEBODY ELSE.

37:51.500 --> 37:54.750
AND JUST GRAB HOLD
OF WHAT HAVE COMING TO YOU.

37:54.750 --> 37:57.792
BECAUSE YOU NEVER KNOW
WHEN IT'S GONNA
COME YOUR WAY AGAIN.

38:01.375 --> 38:02.667
SO...

38:02.667 --> 38:04.750
HOW GOOD OF A KISSER
WAS HE?

38:04.750 --> 38:06.500
ON A SCALE OF 1 TO 10.

38:08.291 --> 38:08.834
20.

38:08.834 --> 38:11.375
OH!

38:11.375 --> 38:12.834
HE'S SO CUTE.

38:12.834 --> 38:13.458
YEAH,
IT WAS GOOD.

38:15.542 --> 38:18.959
I SHOULDN'T
HAVE STOPPED.

38:18.959 --> 38:21.625
SO, WHAT YOU'RE SAYING IS YOUR
BOYFRIEND WILL BREAK UP WITH YOU

38:21.625 --> 38:22.417
IF YOU DON'T WEAR
THONG UNDERWEAR?

38:22.417 --> 38:23.458
THAT'S ABOUT IT. YEAH.

38:23.458 --> 38:25.959
IT SEEMS TO ME
YOU HAVE 2 OPTIONS HERE.

38:25.959 --> 38:27.291
YOU CAN EITHER DUMP HIM,
OR YOU CAN DUMP HIM!

38:27.291 --> 38:29.708
HELLO? GUYS?
WORD TO THE WISE.

38:29.708 --> 38:32.083
BEFORE YOU TRY AND FORCE
YOUR GIRLFRIEND INTO A THONG,

38:32.083 --> 38:35.875
WHY DON'T YOU TRY
PUTTING A PIECE OF FLOSS
BETWEEN YOUR BUTT CHEEKS

38:35.875 --> 38:37.083
AND SEE HOW MUCH
YOU LIKE IT.

38:37.083 --> 38:39.083
CALLER NUMBER 3,
YOU'RE ON THE AIR.

38:45.041 --> 38:47.667
WHAT'S THIS?

38:47.667 --> 38:50.250
PART OF WHAT I OWE YOU
FOR THE DAMAGES.

38:50.250 --> 38:51.875
JUST, UH, YOU KNOW,

38:51.875 --> 38:53.166
LET ME KNOW
HOW MUCH IT ALL IS,

38:53.166 --> 38:55.375
AND I'LL GET IT TO YOU
AS SOON AS I CAN.

38:55.375 --> 38:58.875
YOU KNOW, YOU COULD
HAVE GOTTEN ME FIRED
LAST NIGHT, JACK.

38:58.875 --> 39:00.792
SO, DO YOU WANNA
TALK TO ME ABOUT IT?

39:02.667 --> 39:03.750
ABOUT WHAT?

39:03.750 --> 39:04.917
ABOUT WHATEVER IT IS

39:04.917 --> 39:06.625
THAT'S MAKING YOU
DO THIS TO YOURSELF.

39:06.625 --> 39:08.667
[SIGHS]

39:08.667 --> 39:11.166
WHAT EXACTLY AM I DOING
TO MYSELF, PACEY?

39:11.166 --> 39:14.667
WELL, FOR STARTERS,
YOU'RE FLUNKING YOURSELF
OUT OF SCHOOL.

39:14.667 --> 39:16.750
YOU CAN TALK TO ME
ALL YOU LIKE
ABOUT MAKEUP EXAMS,

39:16.750 --> 39:18.458
'CAUSE I'M THE KING
OF MAKEUP EXAMS.

39:18.458 --> 39:20.000
YOU CAN TELL ME THE WHOLE
THING'S CRAP,

39:20.000 --> 39:21.000
YOU DON'T CARE
ABOUT YOUR GRADES,

39:21.000 --> 39:22.625
BUT I'M NOT GONNA
BUY THAT.

39:22.625 --> 39:24.333
ESPECIALLY NOT FROM YOU.

39:24.333 --> 39:27.333
'CAUSE I KNOW HOW HARD
YOU WORKED TO GET
YOURSELF INTO COLLEGE.

39:27.333 --> 39:30.750
I KNOW THAT IT
MUST TERRIFY YOU TO BE
ON ACADEMIC PROBATION.

39:30.750 --> 39:32.000
AND IT TERRIFIES YOU
BECAUSE YOU JUST

39:32.000 --> 39:33.708
DON'T KNOW HOW YOU GOT
TO THIS POINT, RIGHT?

39:33.708 --> 39:35.333
ALL YOU WERE DOING
WAS CUTTIN' LOOSE,

39:35.333 --> 39:36.542
HAVING A LITTLE BIT
OF FUN.

39:36.542 --> 39:38.959
I MEAN, BELIEVE ME,
I UNDERSTAND.

39:38.959 --> 39:40.291
I'VE BEEN THERE.
I KNOW.

39:40.291 --> 39:42.875
WHAT DO YOU
WANT FROM ME, HUH?

39:42.875 --> 39:44.583
NOTHING.

39:46.041 --> 39:47.875
I'M JUST CURIOUS.

39:47.875 --> 39:50.583
I'M JUST CURIOUS,
'CAUSE FROM
MY PERSPECTIVE,

39:50.583 --> 39:52.000
YOU'RE FLUNKING
OUT OF SCHOOL,

39:52.000 --> 39:53.875
YOU'RE DRINKING
LIKE YOU GOT A DEATHWISH,

39:53.875 --> 39:55.333
ALL SO YOU CAN HANG OUT
WITH GUYS

39:55.333 --> 39:57.166
WHO PRETTY MUCH
ATTACKED YOU LAST NIGHT.

39:57.166 --> 39:58.500
THEY DIDN'T ATTACK ME
LAST NIGHT.

39:58.500 --> 40:00.166
THEY DIDN'T ATTACK YOU?
NO.

40:00.166 --> 40:01.708
JACK, IT WAS
10 ON ONE IN THERE.

40:01.708 --> 40:04.625
AND THEY LEFT YOU HERE,
BLEEDING, JUST IN CASE
YOU FORGOT.

40:04.625 --> 40:07.792
SO I'M JUST CURIOUS.
IS IT WORTH IT?
ARE THEY WORTH IT?

40:11.875 --> 40:13.333
I GOTTA GO.

40:21.291 --> 40:24.125
OLIVER.
CAN I TALK TO YOU?

40:25.792 --> 40:28.208
I, UH, I JUST
WANTED TO TELL YA,

40:28.208 --> 40:30.583
I THINK YOU MIGHT
BE RIGHT ABOUT
THAT ONE SCENE.

40:30.583 --> 40:32.083
THERE IS
SOME PIVOTAL
INFORMATION--

40:32.083 --> 40:33.500
NAH, I CUT IT OUT.

40:33.500 --> 40:37.250
OH. WELL... GOOD, 'CAUSE YOU
DON'T NEED IT.

40:37.250 --> 40:38.583
LOOK, I'M SORRY.

40:38.583 --> 40:41.333
I WENT A LITTLE
OVERBOARD YESTERDAY.

40:42.750 --> 40:43.959
I THINK PART OF ME
WAS TRYING

40:43.959 --> 40:46.083
TO SABOTAGE THE WHOLE THING.
WELL, IT WORKED.

40:46.083 --> 40:49.333
YOU GOTTA UNDERSTAND.
I WASN'T LOOKING

40:49.333 --> 40:50.750
TO GET INVOLVED
IN ANYTHING.

40:50.750 --> 40:52.708
I KIND OF WANTED
TO COAST FOR MYSELF
FOR A WHILE,

40:52.708 --> 40:53.875
REACQUAINT MYSELF
WITH THE WORLD SLOWLY.

40:53.875 --> 40:58.000
AND THEN, UH, YOU THREW
YOUR SCRIPT AT ME,

40:58.000 --> 41:01.083
AND I REALLY LIKED IT.

41:01.083 --> 41:05.583
I GOT EXCITED,
AND, UH, I DIDN'T
WANT TO GET EXCITED.

41:05.583 --> 41:09.125
I WAS
KIND OF TRYING TO...

41:09.125 --> 41:11.959
FEEL AS LITTLE
AS POSSIBLE.

41:11.959 --> 41:13.708
PROBABLY DOESN'T
MAKE ANY SENSE, BUT--

41:13.708 --> 41:16.041
NO, THAT
MAKES TOTAL SENSE.

41:16.041 --> 41:17.667
YOU WERE AFRAID
THAT THE UPSWING

41:17.667 --> 41:20.208
OF THROWING YOURSELF
INTO A NEW PROJECT

41:20.208 --> 41:22.125
WOULD INEVITABLY
PRODUCE A DOWNSWING
WHEN YOU FINISHED IT.

41:22.125 --> 41:25.959
RIGHT? AND,
HEY, MAN. YOU'RE PROBABLY
TIRED OF FEELING DOWN.

41:25.959 --> 41:28.041
I AM.

41:28.041 --> 41:31.083
PLUS THE GUILT THAT
COMES WITH DOING SOMETHING

41:31.083 --> 41:32.542
THAT MIGHT
MAKE YOU FEEL GOOD

41:32.542 --> 41:34.667
WHEN YOU'RE SUPPOSED
TO BE DEALING WITH THIS...

41:34.667 --> 41:36.208
THIS HUGE THING.

41:37.125 --> 41:39.250
YOU KNOW WHAT, DAWSON?

41:39.250 --> 41:41.792
I CAN'T GUARANTEE

41:41.792 --> 41:42.708
THAT NONE OF THOSE THINGS
WILL HAPPEN,

41:42.708 --> 41:46.667
BUT IF YOU TRY
TO COAST THROUGH LIFE

41:46.667 --> 41:49.000
NOT FEELING
ANYTHING GOOD JUST SO

41:49.000 --> 41:50.750
YOU DON'T HAVE TO
FEEL ANYTHING BAD...

41:52.500 --> 41:55.291
THAT'S NO WAY TO LIVE.

41:59.834 --> 42:02.166
I REALLY WANT
TO DIRECT YOUR FILM.

42:02.166 --> 42:03.917
OK.

42:03.917 --> 42:06.041
THANK YOU.
YOU'RE WELCOME.

42:07.625 --> 42:08.083
I HAVE
ONE QUESTION, THOUGH.

42:08.083 --> 42:10.041
SHOOT.

42:10.041 --> 42:11.750
WHY AREN'T YOU DIRECTING IT?

42:11.750 --> 42:13.375
OH.

42:13.375 --> 42:16.458
UM, YEAH.
THAT'S PART OF WHAT
I WANTED TO TELL YOU

42:16.458 --> 42:17.750
YOU KNOW
THE PART OF GAGE?

42:17.750 --> 42:19.000
THE LEAD?

42:19.000 --> 42:22.041
YEAH. I WANNA PLAY HIM.

42:27.834 --> 42:29.750
OLIVER.
