00:00.037 --> 00:03.000
Better off Ted s02e05
FordÃ­totta:galanm

00:03.444 --> 00:05.494
<i>Since I spend most
of my day at work,</i>

00:05.507 --> 00:08.310
It's natural
relationships start to form.

00:08.311 --> 00:11.222
<i>But some of them can be
tricky to navigate.</i>

00:11.232 --> 00:13.000
Gosh, ted.

00:13.008 --> 00:15.249
It's like you were poured
into that suit.

00:15.250 --> 00:17.318
And part of me
is still hardening.

00:17.319 --> 00:19.700
See, that would've been
the wrong thing to say.

00:19.722 --> 00:23.626
Thank you, erica. I value and respect
you as a gender-neutral colleague.

00:24.627 --> 00:27.527
I may have overcorrected,
But it's important,

00:27.555 --> 00:29.888
I always keep things
professional at the office,

00:29.900 --> 00:31.533
With one exception.

00:32.333 --> 00:34.502
Hey, sweetie.
Wanna wrestle?

00:34.503 --> 00:37.038
I'm taking you down,
old man.

00:37.039 --> 00:39.007
<i>since rose started coming
to veridian's after-care,</i>

00:39.008 --> 00:41.176
<i>My coffee breaks include
much more roughhousing.</i>

00:41.177 --> 00:44.679
Ted... Muss up his hair. It's
the source of all his power.

00:44.680 --> 00:46.881
What? No! Oh, no!
Not the hair! Ahh!

00:46.882 --> 00:49.000
Now smash him
with a phone.

00:49.222 --> 00:52.220
Why will nobody in this building
ever smash anyone th a phone?

00:52.321 --> 00:54.722
- What do you need, veronica?
- We have a problem.

00:54.723 --> 00:56.559
It's about sexual...

00:57.760 --> 01:03.064
Uh... Sexual h-a-r-ass-ment.

01:03.065 --> 01:06.102
Hmm. Well, I appreciate you Not letting 
my daughter hear the "har" part of that,

01:06.103 --> 01:10.289
- But why don't we talk about this later?
- And by the way,I'm 8.I know how to spell.

01:10.299 --> 01:14.009
Never show your hand, sweetie.
Always let the enemy underestimate you.

01:14.010 --> 01:17.079
Then when their guard's down,
smash 'em with a phone.

01:21.316 --> 01:24.888
We're having a problem with some of
those people, who live in the cubicles.

01:24.900 --> 01:27.777
No,they don't live in... you know what?
I'm not gonna explain this to you again.

01:27.788 --> 01:31.444
One of the drones Accused another
drone of sexual harassment.

01:31.454 --> 01:34.000
Again?...That's the third time
that's happened to us this year.

01:34.001 --> 01:36.777
I know. Legal won't tell me
who the sleaze-hound is.

01:36.787 --> 01:38.899
But upstairs
is very unhappy with me.

01:38.905 --> 01:42.103
Our whole department looksike a guy
at a bus station Wearing a raincoat.

01:42.113 --> 01:45.555
We are not sleazy. Our department is
more like a hard-working squirrel

01:45.560 --> 01:47.444
Stuffing his nuts in... wait.

01:47.555 --> 01:51.181
We're more like a hard-working beaver
Ah, I'm not gonna land this metaphor.

01:51.382 --> 01:54.900
Let me just go talk to the people in
the cubicles, Find out what's going on.

01:54.909 --> 01:57.285
And get them to stop
coming on to each other.

01:57.286 --> 02:00.256
It might be as simple as improving
the lighting out there.

02:02.557 --> 02:05.593
I just heard they're forcing
chumley into retirement.

02:05.594 --> 02:07.161
That's crazy.

02:07.162 --> 02:09.931
He's the best chemical spill
technician we've ever had.

02:09.931 --> 02:11.499
Is he gone yet?

02:11.500 --> 02:14.135
Let's trigger the floor sensors
and see if he comes.

02:17.111 --> 02:19.140
you know, you could've used water.

02:19.141 --> 02:22.142
As opposed to that beaker
of bald eagle stem cells

02:22.143 --> 02:25.000
I've been painstakingly gathering
For the last two years.

02:25.004 --> 02:27.715
Sorry.
You should label things.

02:30.685 --> 02:34.776
chumley's so great. He's the only one
in the office who's always smiling.

02:34.777 --> 02:37.092
When he looks at you
with those little blue lights,

02:37.093 --> 02:38.988
It's like you're the only one
in the world.

02:38.999 --> 02:40.888
- What's gonna happen to him?
- Don't worry.

02:40.899 --> 02:44.443
Ted told me veridian has a place
where retired robots get to run

02:44.444 --> 02:47.888
and play with other robots.
It's called the technology farm.

02:47.899 --> 02:49.337
Ah. God, that sounds great.

02:49.338 --> 02:52.555
Like the place my mom sent my dog
after he crapped in her purse.

02:52.556 --> 02:56.377
- I got an alert from the floor sensors,
there's a spill. - Who are you?

02:56.378 --> 02:58.746
I'm carlos.
New spill technician.

02:58.747 --> 03:01.282
Apparently I'm cheaper
and require less maintenance

03:01.283 --> 03:04.218
Than your...
Little sucky robot.

03:05.219 --> 03:08.523
My god... What kind of a
sick world are we living in,

03:08.524 --> 03:12.860
where machines can be so easily
cast aside for people?

03:16.444 --> 03:18.998
Hey. So if you had to guess
who in our department

03:18.999 --> 03:21.655
was being accused of sexual
harassment, who would you say?

03:21.659 --> 03:25.006
If I had to guess, I would say that
keith guy, because he's kinda creepy.

03:25.007 --> 03:27.995
But since I know it's me, I'm gonna say
me because I want to win this game.

03:27.999 --> 03:32.600
- You? You sexually harassed somebody?
- It was a stupid misunderstanding.

03:34.983 --> 03:37.318
Sheila, is everything all right?

03:37.319 --> 03:41.088
No, it's not. My cat died.

03:41.089 --> 03:43.491
Oh, no. Senor noodlebaum?

03:43.492 --> 03:46.000
No, that's debbie's cat.
She's an idiot.

03:46.005 --> 03:49.000
My cat was named meow
is the time for all good men

03:49.001 --> 03:52.333
to come to the aid of their country.
I just called him meow.

03:52.555 --> 03:56.737
But meow he's dead.
He loved puns.

03:56.738 --> 04:00.241
I'm so sorry, sheila. You look like
you could use a hug.

04:00.242 --> 04:04.000
Oh, that's okay, linda. I'm not really a
physically affectionate kind of person.

04:04.006 --> 04:07.382
Don't be such a tough guy.
Everyone needs a hug sometime.

04:08.183 --> 04:10.151
See?
Doesn't this feel good?

04:10.152 --> 04:13.588
We call this
a midwestern handshake.

04:16.091 --> 04:18.024
That doesn't sound so sexual.

04:18.026 --> 04:20.293
It was just a hug
that drifted boobwardly.

04:20.295 --> 04:24.599
Apparently, later I got, as sheila's
complaint says, "more molest-y."

04:29.638 --> 04:33.107
- Linda, what are you doing?
- I've been thinking about you all day.

04:33.108 --> 04:36.510
- Ooh, man. You're tense.
- Linda, I...

04:36.511 --> 04:40.047
Relax, sheila.
Don't fight it.

04:42.017 --> 04:44.325
- "don't fight it"?
- Hindsight is 20/20, isn't it,

04:44.326 --> 04:46.333
Mr. "never accidentally
fondled anyone"?

04:46.339 --> 04:48.222
I don't think the words "don't fight it"
Have ever been used

04:48.227 --> 04:50.158
Where someone isn't being
sexually harassed.

04:50.159 --> 04:52.661
What am I gonna do?
I could lose my job over this.

04:52.662 --> 04:54.464
All right, I'll go talk to
sheila and straighten it out.

04:54.465 --> 04:56.700
In the meantime,
try to act like a gentleman.

04:56.701 --> 05:00.000
Just remember, every woman here
is someone's wife or daughter.

05:02.444 --> 05:06.307
I realize it was a little awkward, but
linda was just trying to comfort you.

05:06.308 --> 05:08.143
Well, it wasn't comforting
to me.

05:08.144 --> 05:10.912
No, I get that. But it was
just a misunderstanding.

05:10.913 --> 05:13.381
See, you haven't worked here
that long, and you don't know linda.

05:13.398 --> 05:16.999
If you did, you'd know how clumsy
and accidentally predatory she can be.

05:18.000 --> 05:20.000
You two should really
get to know each other,

05:20.089 --> 05:21.777
get better acquainted.

05:22.000 --> 05:24.500
You want linda and me
to get better acquainted?

05:24.507 --> 05:27.428
Sure. Maybe go out sometime
after work, have some fun.

05:27.429 --> 05:30.298
I could come, too, if you want.
All three of us could do it.

05:30.299 --> 05:32.200
Oh, I don't think
that would be a good idea.

05:32.201 --> 05:34.500
Oh, come on, sheila.
Don't fight it.

05:34.569 --> 05:36.000
Oh, wait.

05:38.000 --> 05:39.433
"don't fight it"?

05:39.444 --> 05:42.710
You'd be surprised how easily that
phrase just slides right outta you.

05:42.711 --> 05:45.546
Sheila claims you propositioned
her for a threesome.

05:45.547 --> 05:47.773
Veronica, I work full-time and
I have an 8-year-old daughter.

05:47.777 --> 05:50.895
I don't even have the energy
for a one-some. This is crazy.

05:50.900 --> 05:52.999
- I'm gonna go talk to her.
- No, you're not.

05:53.007 --> 05:56.591
Now I know it's against your nature
To sit idly by while gotham is in peril,

05:56.592 --> 05:59.195
- ...but you have to sit this one
out. I'll take care of it. - But...

05:59.196 --> 06:03.532
Ted, as a very stupid man
once said, "don't fight it."

06:05.000 --> 06:11.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

06:12.000 --> 06:12.879
- Ted.
- Ted.

06:12.880 --> 06:14.781
They took our robot vacuum to
transportation,

06:14.789 --> 06:16.555
but they forgot
his extra battery pack.

06:16.565 --> 06:18.851
We want to get it to him
before he leaves for the farm.

06:18.852 --> 06:21.687
Righ the farm. Here,
I'll make sure he gets it.

06:21.688 --> 06:25.091
- Mm. We'll give it to him.
- So if you could tell us where it is,

06:25.092 --> 06:29.394
because the guys in transportation
Said there is no farm. jerks.

06:29.395 --> 06:31.111
- There is a farm, right?
- Right, ted?

06:31.117 --> 06:33.299
- Right? - There's a farm, ted.
Tell us there's a farm.

06:33.310 --> 06:35.235
There's a farm. There's a farm.
There's a farm. There's a farm.

06:35.236 --> 06:37.236
- Ah, fellas...
- "No!"

06:37.236 --> 06:39.472
Where did they take him,
you son of a bitch?!

06:39.473 --> 06:42.048
I mean...
My immediate superior!

06:42.055 --> 06:45.533
Guys, I'm sorry. I was trying
to protect you from this, but...

06:45.543 --> 06:48.380
Well, the truth is, when robots
are no longer needed,

06:48.381 --> 06:51.222
They're sent down to the subbasement
To be broken down and used for parts.

06:51.944 --> 06:53.945
I think I'm going to be sick.

06:56.222 --> 06:59.777
I feel like my heart has been
kicked in the testicles.

07:02.333 --> 07:06.499
Hello. I'd like to talk to the lawyer in
charge of employee sexual harassment.

07:06.500 --> 07:08.534
That would be mr. Thomas,
and he's not here.

07:08.535 --> 07:11.222
- Hmm. Will he be back soon?
- That depends on his willingness

07:11.238 --> 07:14.222
to accept the things
he cannot change... wait.

07:14.241 --> 07:16.976
His willingness to change
what he accepts...

07:16.999 --> 07:21.680
No. The wisdom... I don't know.
He's a drunk. He's in rehab... Again.

07:21.681 --> 07:23.993
Well, it's nice
how you honor his struggle.

07:23.999 --> 07:25.552
He does this
five times a year,

07:25.553 --> 07:28.111
But the company can't fire him
because he has a disease.

07:28.121 --> 07:30.523
He also has a disease?
Poor drunk.

07:30.524 --> 07:32.997
No, that's his disease.
He's an alcoholic.

07:32.999 --> 07:35.599
And as long as he's in treatment,
The company can't touch him.

07:36.597 --> 07:39.645
The next day, veronica made
a startling announcement.

07:39.656 --> 07:42.935
Great news.
You both have a disease.

07:42.936 --> 07:45.876
- You would be a terrible doctor.
- I convinced the company...

07:45.888 --> 07:48.541
To classify sexual harassment
as a disease.

07:48.542 --> 07:52.179
That way, anyone accused of it can't 
be fired or punished in any way.

07:52.180 --> 07:54.814
I don't want a sex disease,
especially one

07:54.815 --> 07:56.444
That's assigned to me
by my supervisor.

07:56.451 --> 07:58.818
Nonsense.
The company loved the idea.

07:58.819 --> 08:01.754
Now it can't be sued because
the harasser isn't responsible

08:01.755 --> 08:04.157
For his or linda's actions.

08:04.158 --> 08:07.212
Plus, several of the executives
have their own grope-y,

08:07.213 --> 08:10.111
Squeezy, unzippy problems,
and now their jobs are safe, too.

08:10.114 --> 08:13.777
This is ridiculous. I didn't do
anything. I don't have a disease.

08:13.799 --> 08:16.635
Ted, I'm a hero upstairs.
Don't ruin this for me.

08:16.636 --> 08:20.440
All you two have to do is...
is go to harassment seminars.

08:20.441 --> 08:22.308
We have to go
to harassment seminars?

08:22.309 --> 08:24.555
I have a daughter.
I speak evasive mumble.

08:24.565 --> 08:27.480
Just until you learn how to
control your perverse impulses.

08:27.481 --> 08:30.618
I am not going to any harassment seminar.
No, I am gonna fight these charges.

08:30.619 --> 08:33.653
Yeah, me, too. I don't like
other ladies' breasts.

08:33.654 --> 08:35.688
Some days, I don't even like
my own breasts.

08:35.688 --> 08:38.625
- Although mostly, they're awesome.
- Well, you'll get no argument from me.

08:38.626 --> 08:41.061
And you two don't think
you need a seminar.

08:41.062 --> 08:44.864
Look, if you fight this
and lose, you could be fired.

08:44.865 --> 08:47.834
I don't want to lose this job.
What am I supposed to do,

08:47.835 --> 08:50.003
Go back to wisconsin
and work in the cheese mines?

08:50.004 --> 08:53.545
After I made that big speech, threw down
my cheese shovel and stormed out?

08:53.556 --> 08:56.222
All you have to do, is complete 
the stupid seminar,

08:56.229 --> 08:58.611
And the whole thing will be
expunged from your records.

08:58.612 --> 09:01.247
And you'll get a keepsake-quality
seminar diploma...

09:01.248 --> 09:03.249
Also my idea.

09:03.250 --> 09:06.019
I was on fire up there.

09:12.025 --> 09:13.332
Look at this place.

09:13.333 --> 09:16.555
All these innocent machines
hacked to pieces.

09:17.000 --> 09:19.434
it's like "the texas chainsaw massacre"

09:19.434 --> 09:21.834
If somebody massacred the chainsaws.

09:21.835 --> 09:23.333
Chumley.

09:25.071 --> 09:26.872
Oh! Look at him.

09:26.873 --> 09:29.342
They've ripped the d.C.
Solenoids from his relay module

09:29.343 --> 09:31.177
As if he were
some sort of animal.

09:31.178 --> 09:33.446
We can put him back together.

09:33.447 --> 09:35.515
I fixed my marriage
with mechanical attachments.

09:35.516 --> 09:37.817
I can fix this.

09:40.333 --> 09:45.554
I'm denise, Your sexual harassment
educator, and you are the deviants.

09:45.555 --> 09:49.555
So let's meet each other, shall we?
Ted, why are you here?

09:49.556 --> 09:51.888
Because sheila's cat died,
this one got grabby,

09:51.898 --> 09:53.799
And some of the nonsense
splattered on me.

09:53.800 --> 09:55.601
Bottom line... I am not a harasser.

09:55.602 --> 09:57.737
- Neither am I.
- Yeah, I don't belong here either.

09:57.738 --> 10:00.973
Although I would be open
to some private tutoring.

10:00.974 --> 10:04.329
I'm innocent, too. I just tripped
And grabbed some chick's boobs

10:04.333 --> 10:07.111
to keep from falling.
Plus, she wanted it.

10:07.112 --> 10:10.049
Is there any way I can complete
this course over the internet?

10:10.050 --> 10:12.951
Of course you all think you're innocent.
That's part of the disease.

10:12.952 --> 10:15.456
- No, I don't have a disease.
- That's another part of the disease.

10:15.457 --> 10:19.444
Ted's really not a harasser.
If anything, he's too repressed.

10:19.555 --> 10:20.777
Well, you are.

10:20.787 --> 10:22.962
