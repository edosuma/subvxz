And now back to Jim Carr's Sports Talk.

00:58.119 --> 00:59.703
Hi. Jim Carr again.

00:59.787 --> 01:04.166
Denis, I know that some in our audience
don't know the finer points of hockey.

01:04.291 --> 01:07.044
Could you tell them,
for example, what is icing?

01:07.127 --> 01:11.255
Well, icing happen when
the puck come down, bang, you know,

01:11.339 --> 01:14.217
before the other guys,
nobody there, you know.

01:14.301 --> 01:17.637
My arm go comes out,
then the game stop then start up.

01:18.554 --> 01:21.016
I see. What is high-sticking?

01:21.141 --> 01:25.603
High-sticking happen when the guy take
the stick, you know, and he go like that.

01:25.728 --> 01:28.648
You don't do that. Oh, no. Never, never.

01:28.731 --> 01:31.025
- Why not?
- Against the rules.

01:31.150 --> 01:34.153
You stupid when you do that,
some English pig with no brains...

01:34.236 --> 01:36.697
Denis, what is slashing?

01:36.822 --> 01:39.825
Slashing is like that, you know?

01:39.908 --> 01:43.953
Mm-hm. And there's a penalty for that?

01:44.037 --> 01:47.874
- Yeah. And for trip also, you know.
- Oh?

01:47.958 --> 01:50.251
Like that. And for hook like this.

01:50.335 --> 01:53.005
- And for spear, you know, like that.
- Mm-hm.

01:53.088 --> 01:58.050
All bad. You do that,
you go to the box, you know.

01:58.176 --> 02:02.555
Two minutes by yourself,
and you feel shame, you know.

02:02.680 --> 02:04.890
- Mm-hm.
- And then you get free.

02:06.475 --> 02:10.062
The Chiefs are at home against
Hyannisport at the War Memorial at eight.

02:10.145 --> 02:12.189
Good seats are still available.

02:13.649 --> 02:16.109
- A look at sports.
- I think that went very well.

02:16.610 --> 02:22.365
At defence, for the Chiefs,
number five, Billy Charlebois.

02:22.449 --> 02:27.871
At centre tonight for the Chiefs, number
seven, player-coach Reggie Dunlop.

02:27.954 --> 02:30.081
Dunlop, you stink!

02:30.206 --> 02:34.377
At left wing, number ten, Ned Braden.

02:34.461 --> 02:35.795
I hate you, Braden!

02:35.879 --> 02:41.008
Playing right wing,
number 14, Jean-Guy Drouin!

02:41.133 --> 02:42.635
Frog pussy!

02:42.719 --> 02:45.346
Gentlemen, our national anthem.

03:27.886 --> 03:29.930
Hey, Denis.

03:38.438 --> 03:40.816
- How's it going, Nick?
- I'm drunk.

03:40.899 --> 03:43.193
- Nah!
- I'm not bullshittin' ya.

03:43.276 --> 03:46.195
Got stinkin' shitfaced on the bus.
Louise left me,

03:46.279 --> 03:51.075
and that son of a bitch over there keeps
playin' me when he knows I'm shitfaced.

03:51.200 --> 03:52.368
Jeez, I'm really sorry.

03:52.493 --> 03:57.123
Anybody throws me against the boards,
I'm gonna piss all over myself.

04:13.013 --> 04:15.724
Take it down the other end, Ned!

04:28.987 --> 04:33.074
I thought I'd get Jerry one of those
"Great Ideas of the World" sets.

04:33.949 --> 04:38.663
You can look up the ideas alphabetically,
like arts, mechanics, philosophy.

04:38.788 --> 04:43.417
Yeah. Johnny always says you can
just screw so much and drink so much.

04:52.008 --> 04:57.222
We got Charlestown trailing here three to
nothing, with 10.48 left in the first period.

04:57.347 --> 05:00.600
Whoops! Correction, folks.
That's two to nothing.

05:00.683 --> 05:03.228
We don't wanna make it
any tougher for the Chiefs.

05:19.952 --> 05:24.831
That's what you're paid for, Braden.
Now try winning a game for a change!

05:30.754 --> 05:34.174
Number ten, Ned Braden,
with his 18th goal of the year,

05:34.299 --> 05:38.052
assisted by number seven, Dunlop,
and number 14, Drouin.

05:38.178 --> 05:42.390
Ned Braden is now the leading scorer
in the Federal League. Time of the goal...

05:42.474 --> 05:44.601
Tie it up out there, guys!

05:44.684 --> 05:47.520
Come on, defence!
Get the puck outta there!

05:54.235 --> 05:56.278
Hit him, Billy, hit him.

06:01.533 --> 06:05.370
With us in the press box is
injured Chiefs defenceman, Dave Carlson.

06:05.453 --> 06:08.707
Dave, is it tough sitting here
watching your team lose like this?

06:08.790 --> 06:12.377
- Definitely, Jim.
- You injured your knee in a game.

06:12.502 --> 06:15.172
- No.
- No? I thought you had.

06:15.797 --> 06:19.300
No, I have a cold. You know,
the runny nose and the sore throat.

06:19.425 --> 06:22.678
I went out in that storm
there last week to start my car.

06:22.803 --> 06:26.057
I didn't have my jacket on.
I think it's settled in my kidneys.

06:26.182 --> 06:28.225
We got action in the Presidents' goal.

06:30.769 --> 06:32.897
Hit him with your purse, ya pussy.

06:33.230 --> 06:36.400
Jesus, look at Brophy. He's plastered.

06:36.483 --> 06:40.654
He told me so. If anybody boards him,
he's gonna piss all over himself.

06:40.738 --> 06:43.657
- Piss all over himself? Good one.
- Faire pipi, eh?

06:43.740 --> 06:46.117
No, no. I OK.

07:01.132 --> 07:05.511
..these games, and I'll check my memory
against the statistics as soon as I can.

07:05.595 --> 07:07.638
Joe McGrath.

07:07.721 --> 07:09.098
Oh, yes, miss.

07:15.896 --> 07:19.065
Get off the ice, Nick.
You're gonna kill yourself.

07:30.076 --> 07:32.912
They're out on the ice right now,
giving their all.

07:32.996 --> 07:35.873
- Get it together!
- They will be ready.

07:36.290 --> 07:40.127
Ensemble number 32,
entitled "Omar Sharif',

07:40.253 --> 07:43.255
modelled by Chiefs defenceman,
Billy Charlebois,

07:43.338 --> 07:48.719
who hails from, if I can read the card here,
Moose Jaw, Saskatchewan.

07:48.802 --> 07:52.973
- The padded shoulders give it a '40s look.
- You look nice, son. Real spiffy.

07:53.056 --> 07:56.310
Keep in mind that the perfect accessory
for the man in your life

07:56.393 --> 07:59.354
is a season ticket to the Chiefs' games.

07:59.437 --> 08:03.108
- I look like some cocksuckin' faggot.
- Have you seen Reg or Braden?

08:03.233 --> 08:05.193
Joe, I don't care. Enough is enough.

08:05.318 --> 08:09.613
Nowhere in my contract does it say I gotta
make a fool outta myself. Am I right?

08:09.698 --> 08:13.701
- Have you seen Dunlop or Braden?
- I'm gonna flash 'em, Joe.

08:13.785 --> 08:16.453
I'm gonna open this faggot robe
and wiggle my dick.

08:16.537 --> 08:19.165
- You will not.
- Yes I am, Joe, and you know why?

08:19.248 --> 08:22.835
I want you to have a heart attack and die
so we never have to do this again.

08:22.918 --> 08:25.545
- Fuckin' fashion show.
- It's good publicity.

08:25.629 --> 08:28.966
You fellas have not been drawin' 'em in
the way you have in the past.

08:29.091 --> 08:31.468
I'm gonna wiggle it at 'em,
you cheap bastard.

08:31.551 --> 08:33.595
Be prepared, because when I yank it out,

08:33.720 --> 08:37.933
everybody in that audience except
my wife is gonna be runnin' for the exits.

08:38.015 --> 08:41.852
Ensemble number eight,
as we watch Chiefs defenceman,

08:41.936 --> 08:44.231
Johnny Upton, modelling number eight.

08:44.356 --> 08:47.859
- Joe McGrath. Just checking on Dunlop...

08:55.950 --> 08:58.870
We have two generations
of pro hockey with us

08:58.953 --> 09:01.163
for you folks to call in and question.

09:01.247 --> 09:04.416
Player-coach Reg Dunlop,
and right wing Ned Braden.

09:04.541 --> 09:08.712
Reggie, you represent the old guard, one
of the iron men of the Federal League.

09:08.796 --> 09:11.882
You've been playing pro hockey
now for how many years?

09:11.965 --> 09:14.425
- Quite a few, Jim.
- Is that right?

09:14.509 --> 09:16.470
On the other side of the scale, Ned,

09:16.595 --> 09:19.514
who's a college graduate
and an American citizen.

09:19.597 --> 09:23.894
- At Princeton you were all-Eastern?
- That's what it said in the yearbook.

09:24.019 --> 09:26.479
OK. Our lines are open.

09:26.604 --> 09:30.107
Anything you wanna know about
the fascinating world of pro hockey...

09:30.191 --> 09:33.945
Here we go. Hi there.
Jim Carr. What's your question?

09:34.028 --> 09:37.698
Hey, Dunlop, you old fart. Why don't
you get outta the game and let some...

09:37.823 --> 09:41.077
We're gonna spin some music
while we wait for our next caller.

09:41.202 --> 09:44.705
Before you do that, I know a lot
of kids would enjoy coming to the games

09:44.788 --> 09:46.915
to see a great veteran like Reggie skate.

09:47.040 --> 09:50.794
While we wait for our next caller,
we'd like to remind you folks calling in

09:50.919 --> 09:54.005
to keep your questions
within the boundaries of good taste.

09:55.965 --> 10:00.345
What kind of broad is it that
calls up and says something like that?

10:00.428 --> 10:03.597
- They're supposed to be our fans.
- Who cares? It's over.

10:03.681 --> 10:05.975
Idiot McGrath and his shitty PR schemes.

10:06.100 --> 10:08.227
I hate that cheap little bastard.

10:10.020 --> 10:13.107
What are these poor fuckers gonna do
when they close the mill?

10:13.232 --> 10:16.110
They ain't closing it,
just jacking the guys around

10:16.193 --> 10:18.654
so they'll feel happy they got jobs.

10:18.737 --> 10:21.657
- It's the old tactic, the mindfuck.
- Announced it today.

10:21.740 --> 10:23.784
April 1, they shut it tight.

10:25.660 --> 10:28.204
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

10:28.329 --> 10:32.375
- That's a big surprise.
- 10,000 mill workers placed on waivers.

10:33.334 --> 10:35.378
What the hell
are they gonna do with them?

10:35.503 --> 10:38.215
I don't know.
Every sucker for himself, I guess.

10:42.301 --> 10:45.805
- Hey, who's she?
- Um... it slipped my mind.

10:45.889 --> 10:48.349
Oh, yeah? Maybe your wife'll remember.

10:53.729 --> 10:57.733
You're the best girl in the whole world.
Yes, you are. Yes, you are.

10:57.816 --> 11:01.486
Ruby. How's my Ruby?
How's my girl, huh?

11:01.611 --> 11:04.948
You're a sweetheart.
I missed you. Yes, you're a sweetheart.

11:05.073 --> 11:07.450
Are you my girl?

11:07.575 --> 11:10.537
- Beginning to like it here, huh?
- No. I hate it here.

11:12.080 --> 11:15.041
I'm cracking up, you know what I mean?

11:15.124 --> 11:19.337
- You don't look bad.
- Can't figure it out. I'm slippin' fast.

11:19.421 --> 11:23.257
- I think you look fine.
- Slow down. You're making her nervous.

11:24.550 --> 11:26.761
Jerry, I'd like to cancel the order.

11:26.886 --> 11:29.805
- And there's another little matter...
- Hello?

11:29.889 --> 11:32.099
- Hey, Joe.
- Would you hold it a minute?

11:32.224 --> 11:34.184
What happens to us
when the mill closes?

11:34.309 --> 11:38.230
Don't worry about it. Here, the new
boys are coming in on the 4.15 bus.

11:38.355 --> 11:42.985
I wanna know what happens... Who are
these guys? I never even heard of 'em.

11:43.068 --> 11:47.280
- Son, just take 'em to the hotel.
- I've done enough shitwork for today.

11:47.363 --> 11:49.991
- The fuckin' fans call in with dirty talk.
- Reg.

11:50.074 --> 11:53.578
- Nothing in my contract says...
- Reg! Do you see this quarter?

11:53.661 --> 11:55.621
It used to be a nickel.

11:55.746 --> 11:58.040
Now, the golden years are behind you.

11:58.123 --> 12:01.377
One season, you'll be hanging up
the blades and retiring the axe.

12:01.502 --> 12:02.086
Fuck it.

12:02.169 --> 12:07.132
Then you'll remember it was Joe McGrath
who trained you for the front office.

12:07.925 --> 12:11.845
I'm sorry, Jerry.
Like I say, I'd like to cancel the order.

12:11.929 --> 12:14.889
In fact, I've got
some equipment I'd like to sell.

12:14.973 --> 12:18.727
The skate sharpener,
the massage table, the Jacuzzi, our bus...

12:27.152 --> 12:32.031
Transways Express Flyer number 83,
for Pittsburgh, Cleveland...

12:32.115 --> 12:37.328
- ..ready for boarding at gate two.

12:37.411 --> 12:39.705
Please have your tickets available.

12:44.001 --> 12:46.044
Hey! Hey!

12:48.589 --> 12:51.133
- You the Hansons?
- Fuckin' machine took my quarter.

12:51.258 --> 12:53.468
Who are you?

12:53.552 --> 12:55.512
Reggie Dunlop, the coach.

12:55.595 --> 12:59.266
- Grab your gear and let's get goin'.
- OK. Come on, Steve, let's go.

12:59.391 --> 13:02.977
- It took my quarter.
- Think they show Speed Racer here?

13:05.814 --> 13:07.941
Hey, guys! Wait up.

13:09.484 --> 13:11.527
Look what I got!

13:12.611 --> 13:15.239
- You guys triplets?
- No, I'm in the middle.

13:15.323 --> 13:17.783
Steve's 20 and Jeffs 18.

13:17.908 --> 13:20.702
- Where are you from?
- Iron League.

13:20.786 --> 13:23.330
- The Iron League, huh? A lot of fights?
- Nah.

13:23.414 --> 13:25.457
Hey, I want a soda!

13:26.291 --> 13:29.294
We paid for a week,
then you gotta find a room of your own.

13:29.377 --> 13:34.090
OK, Coach. Gimme a grape or an orange,
and none of that stinkin' root beer!

13:35.341 --> 13:38.679
- We go on the road tomorrow mor...

13:40.055 --> 13:43.016
We're on the road in the morning.

13:43.099 --> 13:47.103
- Bus leaves the War Memorial at 8 a.m.
- I gave you a quarter at the bus station.

13:47.187 --> 13:49.730
Give me another dime.
I'm savin' a dime to call Mom.

13:49.856 --> 13:50.856
Jesus Christ.

13:56.988 --> 14:00.991
You cheap son of a bitch.
Are you crazy? Those guys are retards!

14:01.074 --> 14:05.537
I got a good deal on those boys. The
scout said they showed a lot of promise.

14:05.621 --> 14:08.373
They brought their fuckin' toys with 'em!

14:08.456 --> 14:11.543
I'd rather have 'em play with
their toys than with themselves.

14:11.668 --> 14:13.879
They're too dumb
to play with themselves.

14:13.962 --> 14:16.964
Every piece of garbage on the market,
you gotta buy it!

14:17.090 --> 14:20.010
Reg. Reg, that reminds me.

14:20.093 --> 14:22.804
I was coachin' in Omaha in 1948

14:22.887 --> 14:26.807
and Eddie Shore sends me this guy
that's a terrible masturbator.

14:26.933 --> 14:31.103
Couldn't control himself.
He would get deliberate penalties

14:31.187 --> 14:33.939
so he could get into
the penalty box all by himself,

14:34.022 --> 14:37.526
and damned if he wouldn't, you know...

14:37.610 --> 14:40.696
- Oh, Joe. Jesus.
- What was his name?

14:59.631 --> 15:02.800
"To see the three Chiefs
make a scoring rush,

15:02.925 --> 15:08.306
the bright colours of their jerseys...
flashing against the milky ice,

15:08.389 --> 15:12.518
was to see a work of art in motion."
That's good writin', Dickie.

15:12.601 --> 15:14.978
- I tried to capture the spirit of it.
- You did.

15:18.315 --> 15:21.902
- Want a beer to go along with that?
- It's ridiculous for us to be here.

15:21.985 --> 15:24.446
We stick out like a couple of sore thumbs.

15:24.530 --> 15:27.699
- I'm doin' what I like right here.
- It's making you crazy too.

15:27.824 --> 15:32.119
- You're turning into a zombie.
- I don't wanna have a stinkin' fight again.

15:32.245 --> 15:39.085
"Rookie goalie Denis Lemieux, continuing
his brilliant first season with the Chiefs..."

15:39.168 --> 15:41.212
Il parle de la game d'hier, ecoute Ã§a.

15:41.296 --> 15:44.382
OK. "Denis Lemieux
continue sa saison..."

15:45.007 --> 15:47.051
My father'd give you a job. Yours would.

15:47.176 --> 15:50.346
I'm all for that.
Always good to have choices.

15:50.971 --> 15:53.640
I just wanna get out
of this goddamn dump.

15:57.770 --> 16:00.564
You take the van. I'll keep the dog.

16:05.777 --> 16:07.571
Hey, Lily. Come on...

16:07.696 --> 16:12.825
- What's the matter with her?
- You're bullshit. You're really bullshit.

16:12.908 --> 16:15.120
- You're drunk.
- Yeah, he's bullshit.

16:15.203 --> 16:17.663
Yeah? He and I
are the only decent items in here.

16:17.788 --> 16:22.752
That's great. Why should she give a shit
what people think? She's just scrappin'.

16:22.835 --> 16:24.545
My heart goes out to her.

16:24.629 --> 16:27.381
You guys gotta stop losin'.
Get the power play together.

16:27.464 --> 16:30.009
Yeah, we're working on it.

16:34.054 --> 16:37.390
- Is he nice to her?
- Yeah! He love her.

16:37.474 --> 16:39.518
He tell me. "I love her."

16:40.644 --> 16:43.021
Maybe Braden's a faggot.
Did you think of that?

16:43.146 --> 16:46.650
You crazy?
He has a big cock! Like a horse!

16:47.234 --> 16:49.777
Love is good, love can be strong

16:49.861 --> 16:53.447
We gotta get right back
to where we started from

16:53.614 --> 16:58.411
All right, it's comin' on,
we gotta get right back

17:00.579 --> 17:03.041
Think that lady
in the red dress'll go home with me?

17:03.166 --> 17:06.335
- No. She's not your type.
- How much?

17:06.460 --> 17:09.296
Five dollars
she don't even look at your face.

17:17.012 --> 17:20.515
You got a cute way of talkin'

17:21.766 --> 17:24.394
You got the better of me

17:28.481 --> 17:31.734
- God, Francine, you look terrific.
- You're right.

17:31.818 --> 17:34.653
You've been had. That's his wife.

17:35.989 --> 17:37.698
I'm in a spin, you know

17:40.159 --> 17:42.828
So, how's your money holdin' out?

17:42.911 --> 17:45.831
There's a beer
in the fridge if you want one.

17:45.915 --> 17:48.375
- Is that a new dress?
- Sort of.

17:48.458 --> 17:51.461
Looks good. Kinda tight.

17:51.544 --> 17:54.006
I think I'm gaining a little weight.

17:56.091 --> 17:59.260
- I don't know. Maybe it's better tight.
- Maybe.

18:03.598 --> 18:06.350
Is that the first time you wore that dress?

18:07.768 --> 18:09.813
Been goin' out? Gettin' around?

18:10.730 --> 18:13.691
You been seein' somebody in that dress?

18:15.943 --> 18:17.987
Makin' out?

18:19.488 --> 18:22.574
- That's none of your business any more.
- Jesus, Francine.

18:22.699 --> 18:26.537
I think about you all the time.
Nothing is ever over.

18:26.620 --> 18:30.373
If I wasn't so goddamn busy,
I mean, I'd see more of you.

18:30.498 --> 18:33.669
I was gonna come down the other night
and ask you to the Aces,

18:33.794 --> 18:36.254
but, I don't know, something came up.

18:37.714 --> 18:40.883
What? You need dough?

18:41.801 --> 18:45.471
- Save your money. You're gonna need it.
- Who, me?

18:45.555 --> 18:48.015
When they close the mill,
the Chiefs'll fold.

18:48.140 --> 18:50.935
- That's bullshit.
- These people are gonna be broke.

18:51.019 --> 18:54.772
They're not gonna be going to hockey
games. You're not getting any younger.

18:54.855 --> 18:58.776
- I got nothing to worry about. I coach.
- You're no good at it.

18:58.859 --> 19:01.862
Every player on that team
thinks I'm the greatest.

19:03.822 --> 19:06.825
- What?
- You're a losing coach.

19:07.659 --> 19:09.703
You can't make 'em win.

19:11.454 --> 19:14.625
I was thinking about you the other day,
tryin' to imagine you

19:14.750 --> 19:17.919
when you're through with hockey,
and I couldn't.

19:18.002 --> 19:20.046
There was nobody there.

19:21.213 --> 19:24.717
- What are you gonna do?
- I'm gonna come back to you.

19:26.427 --> 19:29.179
Too little, too late.

19:34.143 --> 19:36.186
- Hey! Charlie!

19:38.939 --> 19:40.983
Ned! Ned!

19:45.195 --> 19:47.322
I underlined the fuck scenes for ya.

19:47.448 --> 19:50.283
Get back in the van.
You're gonna catch pneumonia.

19:59.417 --> 20:04.213
Go back to the van, cos you're gorgeous
and you're gonna catch pneumonia.

20:13.264 --> 20:15.307
Go get her, Billy.

20:19.854 --> 20:24.232
- Back in the o' iron lung.
- She underlines the fuck scenes for ya?

20:25.775 --> 20:29.112
Jeez, she must worship
the ground you walk on.

20:29.237 --> 20:31.698
They teach you
how to underline in college.

20:31.823 --> 20:34.367
Not the fuck scenes, they don't.

20:34.492 --> 20:38.329
Braden, you gotta learn to put out more,
you know what I mean?

20:45.878 --> 20:50.257
Holy Mother of God. Ned.
Ned, are you seein' what I'm seein'?

20:50.882 --> 20:52.760
Hey, Billy.

20:56.221 --> 20:57.139
Jesus!

20:57.264 --> 20:59.474
It's finally happened.

20:59.557 --> 21:02.811
- Hi, guys. How you doin'?
- Hello.

21:02.936 --> 21:05.772
- Hey, fellas.
- They're fuckin' horrible-lookin'.

21:05.855 --> 21:08.232
Don't look at me. It's McGrath's doing.

21:08.357 --> 21:10.985
What did he trade for these assholes?
A used puck bag?

21:11.069 --> 21:13.446
I think it's a fuckin' disgrace.

21:13.529 --> 21:16.448
- Watch Braden. He's gonna do somethin'.
- Hi.

21:18.034 --> 21:21.203
- Are you guys brothers?
- Are you guys brothers!

21:22.663 --> 21:24.790
- What a life.
- OK, bets on the trip, men.

21:24.915 --> 21:28.002
Walt has entrusted me with
our ETA in Lancaster, $5 limit.

21:28.127 --> 21:31.004
OK. I'm ready to take estimates
from the membership.

21:31.088 --> 21:33.466
Walt is the leading contender

21:33.591 --> 21:36.593
for the outdoor record,
Charlestown-Lancaster.

21:36.677 --> 21:39.846
All aboard, son. Let's go, Walt.

21:40.596 --> 21:42.307
Where are the new boys?

21:42.432 --> 21:45.518
Oh, son. There are your brothers.

21:45.643 --> 21:49.940
- Why is the fuckin' old man on this trip?
- I don't know.

21:58.698 --> 22:00.741
I'm expecting great things from you.

22:00.866 --> 22:05.662
Walt, you didn't tell me you were
holding out on your old bookmaker.

22:05.787 --> 22:09.291
Ooh, and it's all right,
and it's comin' on

22:09.374 --> 22:13.044
We gotta get right back
to where we started from

22:13.169 --> 22:14.880
Love is good...

22:15.005 --> 22:17.799
- Who opened?
- On the stick. Let's go, Denis.

22:17.883 --> 22:19.926
Two dollars.

22:20.051 --> 22:22.512
Two bucks. I'll call.

22:22.596 --> 22:25.598
- Fold.
- Let's see.

22:25.723 --> 22:27.683
Two and sixes.

22:27.767 --> 22:30.311
- Hey, that's nice.
- I'm out.

22:30.979 --> 22:33.106
- Kings over.
- Fuck.

22:33.189 --> 22:36.442
- I lose my blouse.
- Shirt. Your shirt.

22:36.567 --> 22:37.901
Shit.

22:37.985 --> 22:41.989
Denis, mon ami, if you sign your contract
over to me, I'll prorate your losses.

22:42.072 --> 22:44.283
Jesus, Braden. You would, wouldn't you?

22:44.366 --> 22:47.953
My ambition is to win all your contracts,
own this club and run it my way.

22:48.037 --> 22:49.997
- I'd make a fortune.
- Yeah.

22:50.122 --> 22:52.499
Compulsory fashion shows
every afternoon.

22:52.624 --> 22:56.128
- Radiothons twice a week.
- Recycled jockstraps.

22:56.253 --> 22:58.713
- Who owns the club, anyway?
- I don't know.

22:58.797 --> 23:00.757
You don't know?

23:00.882 --> 23:03.844
What do you mean?
A corporation owns it.

23:03.927 --> 23:07.597
- Who cares? You get your cheques.
- That's the spirit, Reg. That's it.

23:07.722 --> 23:10.474
Hey, pot's light. Come on. Who's in?

23:11.558 --> 23:12.644
What's the game?

23:12.769 --> 23:15.146
Same game. Jacks or better, progressive.

23:15.271 --> 23:17.314
Nothing wild, right?

23:18.857 --> 23:22.361
Though it's only just begun

23:25.030 --> 23:26.740
You give me your love...

23:26.865 --> 23:31.161
- ..for two to gorgeous Honolulu!
- Oh, my God!

23:31.244 --> 23:36.625
You'll be staying at the all-new
Leisure Inn in downtown Waikiki...

23:36.708 --> 23:39.461
Hey, Drouin. Change the channel!

23:39.544 --> 23:42.213
Changez la canal.

23:42.296 --> 23:44.340
Jean-Guy, leave it. Touche pas.

23:44.424 --> 23:48.636
- Shittiest rink in the fuckin' league.
- That ice is a goddamn disgrace.

23:48.719 --> 23:51.555
You oughta put fuckin' Downy
in these jerseys, Charlie.

23:51.638 --> 23:54.016
Whoa! Hey, guys. Whoa, whoa.

23:54.100 --> 23:58.103
- We're in trouble.
- What? Oh, shit, he's here.

23:58.186 --> 23:59.646
- Who?
- Ogilthorpe.

23:59.729 --> 24:01.857
- Ogie Ogilthorpe?
- You know Ogilthorpe?

24:01.941 --> 24:03.817
- Ogil-terp?
- Ogilthorpe.

24:03.942 --> 24:07.028
For the sake of the game,
they oughta throw him in San Quentin.

24:07.112 --> 24:10.032
- He is a criminal element!
- The worst goon in hockey today.

24:10.115 --> 24:14.035
- Oh, yeah. Real cement-head.
- Big Afro. 21, 22. Watch out for him.

24:14.160 --> 24:16.620
He's not playing. He's suspended.

24:17.622 --> 24:22.001
That's Ogie! 15 minutes. Let's go, now.

24:23.085 --> 24:27.632
Big crowd out there tonight.
Let's really try to win this one, eh, boys?

24:29.050 --> 24:31.802
Gotta hand it to the old bastard,
he's original.

24:31.885 --> 24:34.722
That man travelled
15 hours by bus to say that?

24:38.141 --> 24:40.101
Hey.

24:47.150 --> 24:49.777
- What are you guys doin'?
- Puttin' on the foil.

24:49.861 --> 24:52.530
- Every game.
- Yeah, you want some?

24:52.614 --> 24:54.657
No.

25:00.621 --> 25:04.291
Jesus fuckin' Christ.
They don't leave the bench.

25:04.416 --> 25:06.461
Charlie, ska...

25:10.923 --> 25:16.053
Come on, now. The Chiefs are a terrific
organisation. But, well, the mill is closing,

25:16.136 --> 25:20.181
and I think next year I'd be
interested in a good front-office job.

25:20.265 --> 25:24.895
Al, that's why I made the trip.
I wanted to talk to you fellas face to face.

25:25.020 --> 25:27.480
Excuse me just a minute, Al. Son.

25:29.190 --> 25:33.736
Push that pelvis way up there.

25:34.612 --> 25:39.242
Way, way up there.
Raise your tummy up to...

25:39.367 --> 25:43.829
Let's play it smart out there tonight.
I wanna see a lot of work from you guys.

25:43.954 --> 25:46.873
Use your heads on the ice
out there, will ya?

25:46.957 --> 25:49.919
We all know how to play hockey.
Just play it smart.

25:50.002 --> 25:53.088
- Get out there and stick 'em!
- Fuck 'em!

25:53.213 --> 25:54.923
- Let's go!
- Come on!

25:55.006 --> 25:57.468
- Come on!
- Let's go, now.

25:57.593 --> 26:00.595
- We need this win. We've a lot of losses...
- Yeah!

26:04.808 --> 26:08.061
That's what we're here for, guys. To win.

26:08.186 --> 26:12.899
Play heads-up out there. Let's be smart.
We're better than any club if we try.

26:17.611 --> 26:20.323
Come on, Braden. Our line starts.

26:25.661 --> 26:26.912
It's fucking embarrassing.

26:53.313 --> 26:56.482
- Come on, guys. We can get it back!
- What for? We're history.

26:56.607 --> 27:00.736
- What are you talkin' about?
- McGrath's tryin' to get himself a job.

27:00.819 --> 27:03.739
- Fuckin' team's folding.
- I knew there was a reason he came.

27:03.822 --> 27:06.742
- Nobody told me anything.
- He wasn't gonna tell you.

27:06.825 --> 27:09.537
The fucker was holdin' on
till he could scrounge a job.

27:09.620 --> 27:12.080
- Jesus Christ.
- Cover his wrinkled old ass.

27:12.164 --> 27:15.041
Fuckin' Chrysler plant, here I come.

27:15.125 --> 27:18.045
- The team, fini. Kaput.
- Fini?

27:31.182 --> 27:35.019
This is the last season.
It'll be announced tomorrow.

27:47.280 --> 27:50.951
I'm too old to be traded in.
A one-in-a-million chance.

27:51.034 --> 27:55.205
I'm gonna be calling my brother
tomorrow at the fuckin' Chrysler plant.

27:55.288 --> 27:57.748
Operator? Operator?

27:57.874 --> 28:01.127
Ah! Bernard. Yeah. They close it.

28:01.211 --> 28:04.714
Yeah. Yeah, I want to Ã©changer.

28:05.131 --> 28:08.301
Bernard, call Detroit, tell them bullshit.

28:08.426 --> 28:11.345
Yeah. Yeah, something.

28:11.428 --> 28:13.555
Wait. Ned, what's Ã©changer in English?

28:13.680 --> 28:15.808
Trade me right fucking now.

28:15.892 --> 28:17.851
Trade me right fucking now!

28:17.935 --> 28:19.978
Now hang up.

28:22.480 --> 28:24.858
Hello?

28:24.942 --> 28:27.903
- Wait a minute. Reg!
- Yeah.

28:33.283 --> 28:35.952
Yeah. Hey!

28:36.035 --> 28:40.832
If I had to do it again, I would've gotten
an education. You know what I mean?

28:40.957 --> 28:45.419
Jesus Christ, look at Ned here.
He doesn't have to depend on hockey.

28:45.544 --> 28:47.588
What are you doin' here?

28:50.174 --> 28:52.217
Oh. Where's Hanrahan?

28:53.343 --> 28:56.347
I know a good bar here. The Palm Isle.

28:56.472 --> 28:58.515
Fucked the barmaid last trip.

29:00.225 --> 29:02.185
I mean, I walked into the place,

29:02.310 --> 29:06.398
she comes up to me without even sayin'
hello and just rubs up against me.

29:06.481 --> 29:09.150
Ah, come on, Mo. Jesus. What?

29:09.234 --> 29:13.446
I mean, she had her jugs
right up against my suit.

29:13.530 --> 29:17.033
- Nipples as hard as little rocks.
- Right, Morris.

29:17.450 --> 29:19.910
Yeah. What's the address?

29:20.035 --> 29:22.747
Any of you guys know
the Palm Isle in this town?

29:22.830 --> 29:23.915
Yeah. Don't move.

29:24.040 --> 29:27.376
Before Larry has his one chance
at our Jackpot Bowl,

29:27.501 --> 29:30.755
is there anyone you would
like to say hello to back home?

29:30.838 --> 29:34.007
- Ten bucks he says the guys at work.
- Ten bucks, wife and kids.

29:34.091 --> 29:37.678
- I'm with Braden.
- ..the camera and say hello to anybody.

29:37.803 --> 29:40.347
I'd like to say hi
to all the guys down at work.

29:40.430 --> 29:42.140
- All right!
- Ha!

29:51.899 --> 29:54.527
Put my fucking car
back on the track, will ya?

29:54.611 --> 29:55.778
One more lap.

29:55.862 --> 29:58.072
- Hi, Coach.
- Hi, Coach.

29:58.197 --> 30:00.240
How are ya?

30:03.161 --> 30:05.996
- Two-nothing. Two-nothing.
- Come on.

30:06.080 --> 30:08.373
- Brought your cars, huh?
- We're on the road.

30:08.457 --> 30:11.544
- We're all set to go.
- Tell us when.

30:11.669 --> 30:16.881
Oh. I'm shufflin' lines around, guys. I'll let
you know when I get it straightened out.

30:16.965 --> 30:18.842
- OK, Coach.
- See you later, Coach.

30:18.967 --> 30:21.511
Five-nothing. Five-nothing.

30:21.595 --> 30:25.640
- I'm beating you guys.
- The thing's not workin'. I quit.

30:25.723 --> 30:28.268
I don't wanna play no more.
You broke the darn car.

30:28.351 --> 30:30.478
- How am I supposed to play?
- You big baby.

30:36.859 --> 30:40.696
You are the first man
I've slept with since I left Hanrahan.

30:41.530 --> 30:44.533
Oh, Suzanne. A beautiful woman like you?

30:47.578 --> 30:49.871
I've been sleeping with women.

30:54.668 --> 30:57.045
Are you shocked?

30:57.170 --> 30:59.715
No.

30:59.840 --> 31:01.883
Did you ever wanna sleep with a man?

31:02.008 --> 31:04.135
- No.
- Never?

31:05.761 --> 31:07.806
No.

31:09.474 --> 31:14.103
I don't blame you, though, Suzanne.
You see, women's bodies are beautiful.

31:14.228 --> 31:18.774
But men's bodies, I see 'em everywhere.
Locker rooms, cocks all over the place...

31:18.858 --> 31:22.277
- Do you wanna know how it happened?
- No, that's OK.

31:22.402 --> 31:25.823
No, that's all right.
Cos I have to tell it in court anyway.

31:25.948 --> 31:29.701
See, every time
Hanrahan went out on the road,

31:29.826 --> 31:34.039
I would go over to this wife's house,
and we would get drunk,

31:34.122 --> 31:38.668
and we would talk about how depressed
and lonely we were without the guys.

31:39.877 --> 31:42.422
Every week, blah, blah, blah.

31:42.505 --> 31:47.718
Then, one night, we were talking
about how we hated the life,

31:47.843 --> 31:51.264
and how we had never done
much of anything ourselves.

31:52.306 --> 31:54.683
And I don't know why, really...

31:54.767 --> 31:58.521
We were like kids.
We started playing with one another.

31:59.730 --> 32:01.773
We were drunk, as usual.

32:04.067 --> 32:08.613
The next week we did it sober,
and it was terrific.

32:15.245 --> 32:19.290
At the end of the day, I think about
women. I think about women's bodies.

32:19.373 --> 32:22.544
Maybe it'll change, and
I'll wind up sleeping with old goalies.

32:22.669 --> 32:24.629
Things being what they are, who knows?

32:24.754 --> 32:28.841
When Hanrahan found out about it,
he went crazy.

32:28.924 --> 32:31.928
He said if I was a dyke,
that made him a queer.

32:33.220 --> 32:36.056
He started slapping me around.
I ended up in the hospital.

32:36.139 --> 32:39.727
- Oh, Jesus.
- Yeah. I'm on the lam. I'm hiding out.

32:40.728 --> 32:42.687
We play him next week, you know.

32:42.771 --> 32:47.317
Oh, God. I'm so sick of those games.
They seem so childish.

32:49.903 --> 32:52.196
The Chiefs are folding.

32:53.239 --> 32:56.493
The mills closing,
and the economy and stuff.

32:56.576 --> 32:58.703
I just found out about it tonight.

32:59.579 --> 33:01.622
I don't know what I'm gonna do.

33:01.705 --> 33:05.209
Christ.
A handsome man like you, Reggie?

33:06.794 --> 33:12.174
It ain't easy. I don't see myself
in one of those bullshit nine-to-five jobs.

33:12.883 --> 33:16.303
- Well, you could get traded.
- Suzanne, I ain't a rookie any more.

33:16.386 --> 33:19.807
So far as the coaching goes,
you know, the Chiefs are...

33:21.600 --> 33:25.853
Hey. Use your imagination.
It's what I've been doing.

33:26.187 --> 33:30.900
Oh, look at me! Here I am,
a no-good runaway hockey wife.

33:33.152 --> 33:35.197
A dyke.

33:49.209 --> 33:52.380
Turn it off! I hate it! I hate it, I hate it!

33:52.505 --> 33:55.674
- I don't wanna watch it!
- Don't touch that television!

33:55.757 --> 33:58.134
Sorry about the Chiefs, Reg.

33:58.218 --> 34:02.764
I'm doing a tribute to the team on Sunday.
"Chiefs Fold: A Sad Commentary."

34:02.848 --> 34:05.308
- Something along those lines.
- Dickie.

34:05.767 --> 34:09.938
Something's afloat. This is on the QT,
but I think they're gonna sell us.

34:10.021 --> 34:12.565
I can't name names, but let's just say

34:12.690 --> 34:16.527
that there's a senior citizen's community
in a southern state

34:16.652 --> 34:18.946
that's in the market for a hockey team.

34:19.030 --> 34:21.739
- The Chiefs?
- Actually, it's Florida.

34:22.574 --> 34:26.245
See, they're gettin' a bunch of old geezers
down there from the northeast.

34:26.370 --> 34:30.665
And what do you think
those old geezers really miss in Florida?

34:30.791 --> 34:33.752
I think there are
a lot of shysters in Florida.

34:33.835 --> 34:37.172
Hockey. Their own team.
A Saturday-night game.

34:37.297 --> 34:41.385
Those poor old people down there,
they gotta have something to root for.

34:41.467 --> 34:43.428
- You're a pussy.

34:43.512 --> 34:47.764
Daddy, he called me a pussy
and then he changed the station.

34:47.848 --> 34:51.018
Don't bother your daddy now.
Work it out amongst yourselves.

34:51.101 --> 34:53.228
Baby, baby, baby!

34:53.312 --> 34:58.776
Now, let me get this straight. A retirement
community has bought the Chiefs?

34:58.860 --> 35:02.696
- Oh, no. I said negotiating.
- Well, that's not much to go on, Reggie!

35:02.821 --> 35:05.783
Dickie, Dickie,
they've already built the rink!

35:05.866 --> 35:08.243
They've dumped a lot of capital into this.

35:08.327 --> 35:11.997
What they're really lookin' for
is a cheap deal on a team.

35:13.207 --> 35:16.543
And since we ain't exactly
the Boston Bruins...

35:17.377 --> 35:21.840
How could anybody in his right mind
buy a fifth-place team?

35:21.924 --> 35:25.343
That situation is gonna be changed,
I guarantee you.

35:26.427 --> 35:27.845
Watch your wing!

35:27.929 --> 35:30.223
Hey, Hanrahan!

35:30.306 --> 35:32.350
Hanrahan!

35:33.267 --> 35:35.561
Cover the point, goddamnit!

35:35.644 --> 35:37.688
Come on, Mo! Give it to him.

35:41.650 --> 35:45.070
It's along the boards! Nail him, nail him!

35:50.367 --> 35:52.911
Hanrahan! Suzanne sucks pussy!

36:01.043 --> 36:02.671
Get him outta there!

36:02.754 --> 36:05.048
Watch it behind the net!

36:05.131 --> 36:08.968
Hey, Hanrahan! She's a dyke!
I know! I know!

36:12.347 --> 36:14.306
Come on! Pick it up, take it out!

36:18.978 --> 36:20.938
She's a lesbian! A lesbian!

36:21.021 --> 36:23.565
- A lesbian!
- Son of a bitch!

36:56.597 --> 36:58.724
You're nuts, Hanrahan!

36:58.807 --> 37:01.977
He wouldn't dare
pull anything like that on Johnny.

37:15.281 --> 37:17.492
That's it. That's all.

37:17.617 --> 37:21.621
- Hold it. That's all.
- What the fuck you talkin' about?

37:21.704 --> 37:23.998
- You're out.
- Son of a bitch!

37:24.123 --> 37:26.334
Jesus Christ!

37:35.843 --> 37:39.179
Good job, guys. That's the way.
Two points, that's it.

37:45.644 --> 37:49.064
My allergy to those fucking fans,
you know, has returned.

37:49.148 --> 37:51.107
That ends the longest losing streak ever.

37:51.233 --> 37:54.110
- What did he say to Hanrahan?
- Two points, eh?

38:00.074 --> 38:03.160
Hey, Reg! Reg! What did you say to him?

38:05.580 --> 38:08.582
- I told him his wife was a dyke.
- No!

38:08.707 --> 38:11.001
- Yeah!
- Fuck!

38:11.084 --> 38:13.545
Jesus Christ. No wonder he flipped his lid.

38:13.671 --> 38:16.423
Anybody called my old lady a dyke,
I'd go fuckin' bananas.

38:16.507 --> 38:18.967
His wife is a dyke.

38:19.092 --> 38:22.596
- Jesus Christ. Poor fuckin' guy.
- Does that make him a fag?

38:22.721 --> 38:26.641
Fuck him. Hanrahan's an ape. I knew
it would piss the shit out of him.

38:26.724 --> 38:29.978
She's a fantastic gal. I mean, fantastic!

38:30.103 --> 38:32.313
I knew it'd drive him berserk.

38:32.814 --> 38:35.191
You nailed him, Coach,
in the fucking head.

38:35.274 --> 38:37.318
- Right in his mind.
- He deserved it!

38:37.401 --> 38:39.279
Yeah! Yeah!

38:39.904 --> 38:44.450
That was wrestling shit. They didn't have
a backup goalie. It was a garbage goal.

38:44.575 --> 38:47.036
No, no. You gotta twist them
and fuck with them.

38:47.161 --> 38:49.205
It was a garbage win.

39:00.256 --> 39:02.633
Hey! Hey, Lily!

39:02.759 --> 39:05.137
Lil! Where you goin'?

39:19.734 --> 39:21.777
Hey, Lily!

39:24.780 --> 39:26.823
Hey, Lily.

39:28.826 --> 39:30.869
Hey!

39:32.537 --> 39:34.581
Lil!

39:36.834 --> 39:41.379
Jesus, Lily, there've been three rapes
and two murders in this park in one year.

39:41.462 --> 39:45.217
- I didn't do it.
- We're gonna freeze to death.

39:45.300 --> 39:48.553
If you leave,
you won't have that problem, will ya?

40:10.824 --> 40:13.827
- What's the story on that dog?
- What?

40:14.702 --> 40:16.747
What's the story on that dog?

40:17.998 --> 40:21.417
That's the dog that saved
Charlestown from the 1938 flood.

40:21.501 --> 40:23.544
Well, fuck him.

40:25.797 --> 40:29.300
He's just gonna shock her
with his views on life.

40:31.218 --> 40:33.596
You know, if you were
to come up to my apartment,

40:33.721 --> 40:37.308
I'd fix you a hot drink, rub your back,
and we could find a good game on TV.

40:37.433 --> 40:38.350
Great.

40:38.434 --> 40:42.521
I'd even fix you something to eat,
tell you some stories, and...

40:42.605 --> 40:46.441
Well, by the time pneumonia set in,
you'd be sound asleep.

40:48.985 --> 40:51.029
Well, see you around.

40:53.740 --> 40:59.496
You know, he's... he's been so kind to me.
He comes in every day.

40:59.996 --> 41:03.332
He really doesn't wanna rush
your progress right now.

41:04.083 --> 41:07.170
I think I'll invite him
out to the summerhouse tonight,

41:07.253 --> 41:10.131
so that we can talk about you more.

41:10.214 --> 41:12.758
I wish I could
put my arms around you.

41:12.841 --> 41:15.845
When you get out
of this jacket, you can.

41:17.846 --> 41:20.140
- Hi, guys.
- Hi, Coach.

41:20.640 --> 41:21.891
Reg.

41:21.975 --> 41:24.645
I sold your car.

41:24.728 --> 41:28.231
- My 260Z?
- Yes.

41:31.652 --> 41:34.029
But that was my car.

41:34.112 --> 41:36.239
Alex, don't you remember?

41:36.364 --> 41:40.410
When you had the amnesia,
you gave me power of attorney.

41:40.493 --> 41:42.120
I'd forgotten.

41:42.245 --> 41:45.331
- That cunt is no good.
- Nice talk.

41:45.456 --> 41:47.667
I've boxed up everything.

41:47.792 --> 41:50.461
She do that to make him crazy
so he don't know what he doing.

41:50.544 --> 41:53.005
Cynthia Pierce is having
an affair with Carl Barton.

41:53.130 --> 41:56.801
- She's lyin' to him.
- Oh, Alex. Alex.

41:56.884 --> 41:59.011
You mustn't be weak.

42:01.846 --> 42:05.767
I don't believe this. I don't friggin'
believe this! Hey, you guys, listen.

42:05.892 --> 42:08.436
"Chiefs Sought
By Florida Retirement Community."

42:08.561 --> 42:11.481
- Oh, come on, Dave.
- No, Johnny, it's right here.

42:11.565 --> 42:14.484
Hey, JG, Jimmy, come over here.
Listen to this.

42:14.567 --> 42:18.237
"Unidentified but reliable sources
have informed the Times Herald

42:18.320 --> 42:22.450
that a St. Petersburg, Florida
retirement community is negotiating

42:22.533 --> 42:26.203
with the Charlestown Hockey Corporation
for the purchase of the Chiefs."

42:26.328 --> 42:29.415
It's right there, Reg. Look at that. Yeah!

42:29.540 --> 42:33.835
Dickie Dunn wrote this.
It's gotta be true. Fantastic!

42:34.669 --> 42:37.423
- Florida.
- What sucker would buy the Chiefs?

42:37.506 --> 42:38.966
Jealous there, big guy?

42:39.049 --> 42:41.760
Your mother shoulda bought you skates!

42:41.843 --> 42:47.474
Cut off my balls, I'll be skating in Florida

42:47.557 --> 42:51.143
- We're gonna miss you.
- Here's to the sap that'd buy the Chiefs.

42:51.227 --> 42:53.897
Hell, here's to the Sunshine State!

42:53.980 --> 42:58.275
Here's to all that gorgeous snatch in FLA.

42:58.401 --> 42:59.735
Yeah!

43:21.590 --> 43:24.550
- What's wrong, Reg?
- Huh? Oh, nothing.

43:25.260 --> 43:27.929
You got an expression
of sadness on your face.

43:28.013 --> 43:31.432
- I guess this is my last season.
- No, it's not. We're being bought.

43:31.515 --> 43:35.812
At my age, you gotta think about retiring.
I know all the other teams laugh at me.

43:35.895 --> 43:39.565
- That's not true.
- They do. I hear 'em, every game.

43:39.690 --> 43:43.944
They're just saying that to get you upset.
It doesn't mean anything.

43:45.154 --> 43:47.698
Thanks, kid. Maybe you're right.

44:03.588 --> 44:05.798
Drouin, open your fucking eyes!

44:10.720 --> 44:13.180
Tough news, Barclay. Sorry.

44:13.264 --> 44:15.391
What fuckin' news?

44:15.516 --> 44:19.562
Minnesota dropped you. Yeah,
it's in Hockey News. I'll save it for you.

44:19.645 --> 44:22.105
I got a contract!

44:22.189 --> 44:24.483
Come on, let's go, let's go!
Come on! Let's go!

44:24.608 --> 44:28.862
Know what your problem is, Dunlop?
You're too fuckin' old to play this game.

44:28.945 --> 44:31.407
Take that sentence back!

44:46.462 --> 44:48.756
Too much, too soon.

45:04.730 --> 45:07.399
Dave, hold it steady.
You're makin' me miss.

45:07.482 --> 45:10.026
You got him, Dave!

45:10.151 --> 45:14.156
Did you hear what he said?
He shouldn't have said what he said.

45:14.239 --> 45:16.533
You don't say stuff like that on the ice.

45:16.616 --> 45:19.785
- Let's just win the game.
- We are winnin' the friggin' game!

45:19.910 --> 45:22.372
You goon!

45:22.497 --> 45:25.458
You wanna say some more,
you ugly bastard?

45:31.881 --> 45:35.634
Yeah! Yeah! Yeah, get him!

45:39.138 --> 45:42.224
We were all there.
We all saw it with our own eyes.

45:43.308 --> 45:44.768
Dave.

45:44.852 --> 45:49.397
Goddamn lardass, Barclay Donaldson.
I'm tellin' you, he jumped us.

45:49.481 --> 45:52.650
Gloves off, stick down, no warning.
He challenged the Chiefs!

45:52.776 --> 45:55.237
- He called us names.
- Called us names!

45:57.030 --> 45:59.991
- But Dave was there.
- Dave's a killer!

46:00.074 --> 46:02.869
- Dave's a killer.
- Dave's a mess.

46:03.661 --> 46:05.705
OK, but Dave's out.

46:08.499 --> 46:12.086
- Who's gonna take his place?
- Is the answer Jesus?

46:15.464 --> 46:17.842
OK, guys. Show us what you got.

47:07.764 --> 47:10.141
God save us.

47:11.643 --> 47:15.063
Kill 'em! Kill the bastards!

47:20.276 --> 47:22.736
I do not believe my friggin' eyes.

47:32.079 --> 47:35.040
These guys are a fucking disgrace.

47:42.756 --> 47:47.468
And I'm telling you, Broom County
is just visibly upset by this display.

47:47.594 --> 47:50.138
Get places for the home games.
Bring the kids.

47:50.221 --> 47:53.057
We got entertainment
for the whole family.

48:09.615 --> 48:12.785
There goes Jeff Hanson
into the corner. No, it's Jack.

48:12.868 --> 48:16.538
17. I'll have to check that later.
A crushing check on the boards!

48:16.663 --> 48:19.040
Things are really going on out there now!

48:19.123 --> 48:24.087
Now Steve is in front of the net. I think
that's Steve. Yes. No. Yeah, it is Steve.

48:38.476 --> 48:40.936
And I think that was Jack.
It was Jeff or Jack.

48:41.061 --> 48:43.939
These brothers are stomping all over...

48:46.192 --> 48:49.152
- You! Out!
- What?

48:49.236 --> 48:51.613
- You! Out!
- Huh? What for?

48:51.738 --> 48:55.325
- You! Out!
- No! No!

48:57.994 --> 49:00.830
- Get your eyes examined, you idiot!
- What are you doin'?

49:00.913 --> 49:04.084
- They're all gone!
- It was self-defence, for Christ's sake!

49:04.209 --> 49:07.044
- They're gone!
- How much do you expect a man to take?

49:07.128 --> 49:10.131
- Don't come near me.
- Are you runnin' a goddamn dance?

49:31.776 --> 49:34.154
- Open it.

49:42.036 --> 49:45.707
- Joe, who own the Chiefs?
- Owns. Owns.

49:45.832 --> 49:48.209
Owns. Owns.

49:48.292 --> 49:50.335
I don't know.

49:51.337 --> 49:53.381
Thanks.

50:04.474 --> 50:07.228
- OK. What?
- He don't know.

50:08.479 --> 50:10.772
- How'd you ask?
- I say "Who own the Chiefs?"

50:10.856 --> 50:13.650
- What did he say?
- Owns. Owns.

50:13.733 --> 50:15.277
For Christ's sake.

50:15.360 --> 50:18.071
I don't care who own the Chiefs.
I hate it here.

50:18.154 --> 50:22.700
It make me sick. My allergy,
puke every time, bleugh! Like that, puke.

50:22.783 --> 50:25.787
You're a goalie.
You're supposed to be like that.

50:25.870 --> 50:27.913
Somebody own the Chiefs.

50:27.997 --> 50:30.207
We go to Florida and I get the money.

50:44.387 --> 50:46.431
That's nice.

50:49.559 --> 50:54.022
I don't like the way they cover their jugs
all up with the feathers, you know, Reg?

50:54.105 --> 50:56.399
They are so beautiful.

51:00.278 --> 51:04.991
They oughta cut the costumes up higher
on the thigh, so you can see more ass.

51:05.116 --> 51:08.285
You make me sick
when you speak, Morris.

51:08.369 --> 51:11.246
This isn't art. This is sex.

51:22.174 --> 51:23.967
Ooh!

51:24.051 --> 51:26.261
Ogilthorpe fucked her, you know.

51:27.011 --> 51:29.389
It's true. I heard it from a couple of guys.

51:29.514 --> 51:33.351
Ogilthorpe fucked the last girl
on the pinwheel of the Ice Stravaganza.

51:33.434 --> 51:35.645
That's her, right there.

51:44.695 --> 51:48.032
Get your butt in gear, for the love of Mike.

52:19.187 --> 52:21.564
- You gals like skatin', huh?
- Sure.

52:22.189 --> 52:26.819
I mean, dressed as bluebirds with all them
feathers on, racin' around the ice like that.

52:26.903 --> 52:30.906
- You should talk.
- No, well, I just asked out of curiosity.

52:30.989 --> 52:34.409
- I like to see how the other half lives.
- Renee, I like to skate too.

52:34.535 --> 52:36.829
- But the hair is rotten here.
- Hair?

52:36.912 --> 52:38.955
Yeah. The hair.

52:40.081 --> 52:41.582
- Air.
- It make me sick.

52:41.666 --> 52:44.669
- Your face is a mess.
- I got in a fight. See?

52:46.046 --> 52:48.005
I don't know. It looks sorta cute.

52:48.089 --> 52:51.176
- Are you a fighter?
- Nah. I'm a lover.

53:01.143 --> 53:03.771
Is your team any good?

53:03.854 --> 53:07.358
No. In fact, we're so bad
that we're disbanding.

53:07.441 --> 53:09.902
What about Florida, eh, Reg?

53:10.027 --> 53:13.113
- Well, we got a win.
- We won three games in a row, Reg.

53:13.196 --> 53:16.158
- Yeah. We're on a roll.
- We're on a roll. We're gonna win.

53:16.241 --> 53:18.618
- How's Ogie Ogilthorpe?

53:18.702 --> 53:21.454
- Who?
- Ogie Ogilthorpe. You know old Ogie.

53:21.913 --> 53:25.083
- Ogie.
- You think he's all he's cracked up to be?

53:25.166 --> 53:27.210
Is he a nice guy?

53:27.543 --> 53:29.503
I'll be right back.

53:33.549 --> 53:37.803
- You're doing great. You've got 'em...
- Oh, yeah. You betcha.

53:40.181 --> 53:41.349
Hey, Coach!

53:41.474 --> 53:43.434
How you doin'?

53:52.192 --> 53:54.235
Son of a bitch.

54:01.576 --> 54:04.453
Ooh, and it's all right,
and it's comin' on...

54:04.537 --> 54:06.998
Hey, where the hell
did all this beer come from?

54:07.081 --> 54:09.208
- It's from the owner.
- The owner?

54:09.709 --> 54:10.876
Yeah.

54:10.960 --> 54:12.669
How's his family, Reg?

54:12.794 --> 54:15.006
He told me to say he's glad we're winnin',

54:15.089 --> 54:17.883
cos it'll make it easier
to close that Florida deal.

54:17.966 --> 54:20.093
- You find the guy name?
- Oh, yeah.

54:20.218 --> 54:25.015
- He's neat. Looking to get us bonuses.
- Hey, that's good news, eh?

54:25.098 --> 54:27.309
- Yeah.

54:27.434 --> 54:29.728
- What? What?
- Beats me.

54:29.812 --> 54:32.898
No one can take your place

54:35.775 --> 54:37.819
If you get hurt

54:40.738 --> 54:43.407
- What the fuck is that?

54:44.867 --> 54:46.911
Hey!

54:47.036 --> 54:48.371
Where? Oh, yeah!

54:56.253 --> 54:59.756
- We thought it'd be a big surprise.
- It's wonderful!

55:03.385 --> 55:06.054
You look like my mother! You're beautiful!

55:07.806 --> 55:09.432
Yeah! Billy!

55:14.187 --> 55:17.356
Hey. It's me, Reg. How are you?

55:18.733 --> 55:21.736
We're kickin' the shit
outta everybody. We're unbeatable.

55:21.861 --> 55:23.904
Listen, I got a favour to ask ya.

55:24.030 --> 55:26.950
Yeah. Remember Francine?

55:27.617 --> 55:31.036
All together in one room. Why not?

55:32.079 --> 55:36.876
My ex-wife. Yeah, the pretty one.
Well, has she been in there?

55:37.918 --> 55:41.504
- We're in the Chiefs!
- It's against our policy.

55:41.588 --> 55:44.341
Couple of tickets in it for you. Which bar?

55:46.301 --> 55:50.847
Wait a minute. Hold it. No, it's just
everybody's going bananas in here.

55:54.392 --> 55:56.936
- They convicted Ogilthorpe.
- Help me.

55:57.061 --> 55:59.522
Get the manager. Somebody help me.

55:59.606 --> 56:02.775
Eddie? Listen, this guy she was with -
what did he look like?

56:02.900 --> 56:06.487
It's their rink, it's their ice
and it's their fuckin' town.

56:06.612 --> 56:09.073
- But tonight we got our fans with us!
- Yeah!

56:09.198 --> 56:13.118
They spent their own dough to get here,
and they came here to see us.

56:13.243 --> 56:17.790
Let's show 'em what we got. Get out
on the ice and let 'em know you're there.

56:17.915 --> 56:20.876
Get that stick in their side,
let 'em know you're there.

56:20.959 --> 56:23.628
Get that lumber in his teeth,
let him know you're there!

56:23.711 --> 56:25.505
Bleed all over 'em.
Let 'em know you're there.

56:25.589 --> 56:27.716
Give 'em a good warm-up, Danny.
Let's go.

56:27.799 --> 56:29.842
Come on, fellas.

56:29.926 --> 56:32.303
Good game tonight, guys.

56:36.390 --> 56:39.810
The Peterborough Patriots
versus the Charlestown Chiefs,

56:39.935 --> 56:42.647
brought to you by
Sheehan's Rustproofing.

56:42.730 --> 56:45.649
The Chiefs have come out
on the ice for a warm-up period.

56:45.733 --> 56:48.610
They're about to try
for their fifth consecutive win.

56:48.693 --> 56:50.988
They're applauded by their booster club,

56:51.071 --> 56:55.367
who have travelled all the way
from Charlestown to be here tonight.

57:28.773 --> 57:32.194
There's no one to stop it because
there are no officials on the ice.

57:32.277 --> 57:35.780
What has come over
the Charlestown Chiefs?

57:43.371 --> 57:47.667
And the rockets' red glare

57:47.792 --> 57:52.088
The bombs bursting in air

57:52.213 --> 57:57.093
Gave proof through the night

57:57.218 --> 58:02.180
That our flag was still there

58:02.849 --> 58:05.309
I got my eye on you.
You pull one thing, you're out.

58:05.392 --> 58:07.936
I run a clean game.
Any trouble, I'll suspend you.

58:08.061 --> 58:10.188
I'm listening to the fucking song!

58:14.401 --> 58:20.657
O'er the land of the free

58:20.740 --> 58:26.328
No. No, no. To Mrs. Reggie Dunlop,
from Reggie Dunlop.

58:26.412 --> 58:28.373
Collect.

58:30.041 --> 58:34.044
Well, make it...
Operator, I'll pay for the call here.

58:36.089 --> 58:38.049
Whoa!

58:38.549 --> 58:40.842
- What are you doin'?
- Makin' it look mean.

58:40.926 --> 58:42.344
Yeah!

58:46.890 --> 58:51.436
Honey? We won last night. Yeah, we won.
I got a good winning streak going...

58:52.146 --> 58:54.606
- Who is this?

58:54.689 --> 58:56.733
Hello?

58:57.859 --> 58:59.902
Shit!

59:10.079 --> 59:13.916
A little bit south of Saskatoon

59:15.500 --> 59:18.837
Me and Junie Mae, we got on fine

59:19.338 --> 59:21.882
Till I had to move

59:21.965 --> 59:24.008
Gin.

59:26.178 --> 59:28.221
Eight.

59:30.848 --> 59:32.893
- Hey, Reg?
- Yeah?

59:34.436 --> 59:37.230
- I think I'm gonna change my name.
- Oh, yeah?

59:37.313 --> 59:39.357
Yeah.

59:40.232 --> 59:42.443
Killer.

59:42.527 --> 59:45.613
Hey, that's got a nice ring to it, kid.

59:45.738 --> 59:47.239
Yeah.

59:56.748 --> 59:58.876
I'm not gonna do it.

59:59.877 --> 01:00:02.337
- I'm not gonna goon it up for you.
- No?

01:00:04.339 --> 01:00:06.717
Nope.

01:00:07.718 --> 01:00:09.761
I'll bench you.

01:00:10.720 --> 01:00:12.847
I'll take my chances.

01:00:13.974 --> 01:00:17.393
Keep on thinkin' of my honeymoon

01:00:18.019 --> 01:00:22.565
A little bit south of Saskatoon

01:00:26.277 --> 01:00:28.820
Pick up the boosters!

01:00:29.154 --> 01:00:30.698
Pull over, Walt!

01:00:30.781 --> 01:00:33.325
Let's get the girls in here.

01:00:33.409 --> 01:00:35.786
Come on, Walt!

01:00:36.411 --> 01:00:38.372
Great.

01:01:01.226 --> 01:01:04.021
My husband will kill me
when he finds out.

01:01:04.105 --> 01:01:05.189
Let's go.

01:01:06.607 --> 01:01:09.693
Their bus is coming up the street!
They're coming!

01:01:12.488 --> 01:01:14.948
We don't need you here!

01:01:15.365 --> 01:01:18.368
There's no room in sports
for people like you.

01:01:19.035 --> 01:01:21.079
Get outta town!

01:01:24.457 --> 01:01:28.211
Keep thinkin' of my honeymoon

01:01:28.295 --> 01:01:32.590
A little bit south of Saskatoon

01:01:33.966 --> 01:01:37.804
By a big old fire and honeymoon

01:01:38.054 --> 01:01:40.264
A little bit south

01:01:40.723 --> 01:01:43.016
7-1. There's the face-off.

01:01:44.018 --> 01:01:48.480
Charlestown Chiefs seem to be
coming down the ice with the puck.

01:01:51.399 --> 01:01:53.944
Kill those Hanson creeps!

01:02:00.576 --> 01:02:02.452
You goons! You can't skate!

01:02:03.411 --> 01:02:06.414
We like to see an old-fashioned
brand of hockey played here.

01:02:06.497 --> 01:02:09.334
You're a bunch of animals,
you Hanson apes!

01:02:23.180 --> 01:02:26.183
Get outta town, four-eyes!

01:02:43.616 --> 01:02:46.494
- Is this the guy?
- Yeah, that's him!

01:02:46.577 --> 01:02:48.704
No, he's over there!

01:02:53.667 --> 01:02:57.839
Ladies and gentlemen, look at that.
You can't see that. I'm on radio.

01:02:59.674 --> 01:03:01.884
No, no, not him. That's the one!

01:03:03.176 --> 01:03:05.553
Go fuck a moose, froggy!

01:03:05.637 --> 01:03:07.681
Think we should get into this?

01:03:09.182 --> 01:03:10.809
Just a thought.

01:03:10.892 --> 01:03:14.813
- It wasn't me!
- No, Jeff, no. It's the other guy.

01:03:20.151 --> 01:03:22.904
Think the old folks in Florida
are gonna like these guys?

01:03:22.988 --> 01:03:25.948
I don't believe a word of that Florida shit.

01:03:26.032 --> 01:03:30.160
The fans are standing up to them. The
security guards are standing up to them.

01:03:30.244 --> 01:03:33.039
The peanut vendors
are standing up to them!

01:03:33.122 --> 01:03:35.916
If I could get down there,
I'd be standing up to them!

01:03:47.261 --> 01:03:49.554
- What hit you?
- An object, right in the face.

01:03:49.680 --> 01:03:52.849
- I know. What was it?
- I don't know. Key chain, you know.

01:03:52.974 --> 01:03:55.519
- Car keys, house keys.
- Keys to the camper.

01:04:04.194 --> 01:04:06.571
- Hi, guys.
- The Hansons.

01:04:09.031 --> 01:04:12.535
Guys? Put the fucking bus in gear.
The cops have come for the Hansons.

01:04:12.660 --> 01:04:15.371
- The cops?
- How many are out there?

01:04:19.959 --> 01:04:22.002
The Hansons.

01:04:24.879 --> 01:04:28.550
I throw up my hands. I can't control
'em any more. They gotta be punished.

01:04:28.675 --> 01:04:31.636
Will you do me a favour
and put 'em behind bars?

01:04:35.264 --> 01:04:39.894
They're looking for you guys.
There's gotta be some misunderstanding.

01:04:44.440 --> 01:04:49.069
Look at his lip. Somebody threw a fucking
tyre chain, hit him right in the mouth.

01:04:49.153 --> 01:04:51.530
Scratches, made by human fingernails.

01:04:51.613 --> 01:04:53.824
This kid has taken a savage beating.

01:04:55.576 --> 01:04:58.453
There's six of them out there for us.

01:04:58.537 --> 01:05:03.250
They're gonna put you in the same jail
with Ogilthorpe. Come on, you guys.

01:05:03.959 --> 01:05:06.503
They let you make one phone call.

01:05:06.628 --> 01:05:10.132
They book you, then they give you a dime
and let you make one phone call.

01:05:10.257 --> 01:05:15.052
- Call the pizza man!
- Why don't you call a massage parlour?

01:05:15.970 --> 01:05:19.140
- Hey, guys, we'll see you later.
- Save me a piece of pizza.

01:05:19.265 --> 01:05:23.894
- Don't eat my watermelon sticks.
- Don't admit to nothing, you guys.

01:05:26.189 --> 01:05:30.359
It's me - Reg. They're puttin' the Hansons
away on a trumped-up charge.

01:05:30.442 --> 01:05:34.363
Someone threw a monkey wrench.
Yeah, it hit Jeff right in the face.

01:05:34.446 --> 01:05:38.492
No, they were defending the honour
of Charlestown at the time.

01:05:39.409 --> 01:05:42.246
The boosters are behind us 100 per cent.

01:05:43.747 --> 01:05:45.790
Dickie? Have you seen Francine?

01:05:45.874 --> 01:05:50.337
Sergeant, you will never meet a greater
champion of pure hockey than me.

01:05:50.462 --> 01:05:52.422
Sergeant, I knew Eddie Shore!

01:05:52.547 --> 01:05:54.757
- You guys back there?
- Hey, Coach!

01:05:54.882 --> 01:05:58.136
Peterborough lost tonight,
so as of now we're in the play-offs!

01:05:59.304 --> 01:06:03.849
Sergeant, I would like to see the bail
just a little more reasonable...

01:06:03.932 --> 01:06:07.853
- Joe, hurry it up. Let's get outta here.
- Sergeant, when is the trial?

01:06:07.937 --> 01:06:10.230
You can't keep them here.
They're folk heroes.

01:06:10.355 --> 01:06:13.316
- They're criminals.
- Most folk heroes start as criminals.

01:06:13.400 --> 01:06:16.236
Sergeant, you're asking
an exorbitant sum.

01:06:16.320 --> 01:06:19.906
Joe, I got it right here. How much
are these goons gonna cost us?

01:06:19.989 --> 01:06:22.993
- Hey, guys! Braden's bailin' you out!
- $250 each.

01:06:23.076 --> 01:06:27.789
This young fella is in a hurry because he's
got the prettiest wife you ever saw waitin'.

01:06:27.914 --> 01:06:30.457
- But she ain't happy.
- Sam, let 'em out.

01:06:31.501 --> 01:06:33.127
I want a receipt.

01:06:33.211 --> 01:06:35.087
Hey, hey, hey!

01:06:35.212 --> 01:06:38.215
Hey, Coach, look,
we got to keep our bracelets.

01:06:38.340 --> 01:06:40.301
Thanks a lot, Sarge.

01:06:41.302 --> 01:06:43.512
- Let's get on the bus.
- Look at that.

01:06:45.347 --> 01:06:49.018
The boys and I want you
to have this as a little memento.

01:06:49.101 --> 01:06:52.354
It's a Chiefs key ring.
You can't buy these in stores.

01:07:14.750 --> 01:07:18.170
- Aren't those Hansons something?
- Aren't they, though?

01:07:18.295 --> 01:07:21.882
- They're sorta funny-looking.
- Real funny-looking.

01:07:22.007 --> 01:07:24.718
- They're probably real good guys.
- Underneath.

01:07:24.801 --> 01:07:28.639
- They couldn't be as dumb as they look.
- Yes, they could.

01:07:28.722 --> 01:07:30.766
They're just goons.

01:07:31.433 --> 01:07:34.227
Johnny doesn't care for fighting.
He told me so.

01:07:34.310 --> 01:07:36.605
That's bullshit.

01:07:44.028 --> 01:07:49.408
If we weren't so far below sea level,
the radio reception here'd be much better.

01:07:50.659 --> 01:07:53.121
Ooh, I'm getting tipsy!

01:07:53.204 --> 01:07:55.664
I've been shitfaced for the past week.

01:07:55.790 --> 01:07:57.833
I only drink in the afternoon.

01:07:58.875 --> 01:08:02.630
Or before a game.
Or when Johnny's away.

01:08:03.297 --> 01:08:05.424
Me too.

01:08:05.507 --> 01:08:07.634
If I'm not tight, I can't stand it.

01:08:07.759 --> 01:08:09.803
That's terrible.

01:08:14.724 --> 01:08:16.434
It's sad

01:08:16.517 --> 01:08:18.310
So sad

01:08:18.435 --> 01:08:22.189
It's a sad, sad situation

01:08:22.314 --> 01:08:26.611
And it's getting more and more absurd

01:08:29.738 --> 01:08:31.532
It's sad

01:08:31.657 --> 01:08:33.367
So sad

01:08:33.450 --> 01:08:36.537
Why can't we talk it over?

01:08:37.412 --> 01:08:40.040
Oh, it seems to me

01:08:40.457 --> 01:08:45.337
That sorry seems
to be the hardest word

01:09:25.000 --> 01:09:27.460
- How you doin', Lil?
- Hey, Johnny.

01:09:38.011 --> 01:09:40.305
Hey, Lil?

01:09:40.430 --> 01:09:42.475
Lil!

01:09:48.731 --> 01:09:51.608
Hiya. Let's go someplace.
You know the Aces?

01:09:51.692 --> 01:09:54.236
- Bully!
- Let's start something.

01:09:54.319 --> 01:09:57.197
- Get the fuck out. I'm going home.
- Oh, yeah?

01:09:57.948 --> 01:10:00.325
Where's Braden going?

01:10:06.123 --> 01:10:08.499
I got a better idea. Let's die in bed.

01:10:08.583 --> 01:10:11.210
- You're nuts.
- Jeez.

01:10:12.044 --> 01:10:15.048
You really married a weirdo.
He don't run with the traffic.

01:10:15.131 --> 01:10:18.008
- Speakin' of weirdos.
- Me? I'm normal.

01:10:18.092 --> 01:10:20.385
Yeah? Well, then, normal is fucked.

01:10:21.012 --> 01:10:23.556
How come you talk dirty?

01:10:24.765 --> 01:10:27.517
Cos my family has money.

01:10:28.769 --> 01:10:30.813
Leave him.

01:10:32.523 --> 01:10:35.066
My wife left me. I was drivin' her crazy.

01:10:36.025 --> 01:10:39.363
All she could do was
drink and cry, like you.

01:10:42.073 --> 01:10:45.827
Every time she sees me, it drives me
nuts, cos I know she's askin' herself

01:10:45.911 --> 01:10:48.454
"How did I get mixed up
with a bum like him?"

01:10:48.580 --> 01:10:50.623
- Good question.
- Oh, yeah?

01:10:51.582 --> 01:10:54.836
Next year you'll ask yourself
the same question about Braden.

01:10:54.919 --> 01:10:57.213
He treats you like shit.

01:11:00.382 --> 01:11:04.929
He told me you only paid attention to me
to make him crazy, so that he'd fight.

01:11:05.012 --> 01:11:07.472
Yeah. That's part of it.

01:11:08.640 --> 01:11:11.477
But mainly it's cos I think you're a champ.

01:11:11.560 --> 01:11:14.020
Only you gotta stop killin' yourself.

01:11:24.614 --> 01:11:26.825
My place. Hm. That's a coincidence.

01:11:28.076 --> 01:11:30.119
- Get out!
- Hey.

01:11:30.953 --> 01:11:35.833
You gotta roll with it, kid. Use your
imagination. That's what I've been doing.

01:11:35.917 --> 01:11:38.294
I can get you straight.

01:11:38.419 --> 01:11:40.379
Beat it.

01:11:43.007 --> 01:11:44.967
Well, I'll see you later.

01:12:02.442 --> 01:12:05.361
I'm proud of you.
They're talkin' about you in the streets.

01:12:05.444 --> 01:12:09.282
- Want a White Avenger?
- No. Gimme a cup of coffee.

01:12:09.407 --> 01:12:14.203
- That was a nice tribute to the guys.
- I tried to capture the spirit of the thing.

01:12:14.286 --> 01:12:16.956
This is Dickie Dunn.
He wrote the article on you.

01:12:17.039 --> 01:12:20.709
Hi, guys. Nice to meet you. I was tryin'
to capture the spirit of the thing.

01:12:24.130 --> 01:12:26.173
Hi, guys.

01:12:32.304 --> 01:12:34.764
See the game tonight,
compliments of the Chiefs.

01:12:34.848 --> 01:12:37.392
- Gee, thanks, Reggie.
- Hey! Free tickets!

01:12:37.475 --> 01:12:40.645
- Sure! Spread 'em around, guys!
- Hey, thanks.

01:12:40.729 --> 01:12:42.855
Come to the game,
compliments of the Chiefs.

01:12:42.939 --> 01:12:47.568
- Thanks, Reggie.
- You taught that guy a lesson last night.

01:12:47.651 --> 01:12:51.405
- He was sensational.
- I guess that was a big fight?

01:12:51.489 --> 01:12:53.866
- Are you in pain?
- No. It hurt like hell.

01:12:53.949 --> 01:12:56.410
Oh, you poor thing.

01:12:56.494 --> 01:13:01.623
Look, I'll make you a double dose of this
stuff, and you won't feel anything.

01:13:01.706 --> 01:13:02.958
Good.

01:13:03.083 --> 01:13:05.210
What happened to you?

01:13:05.336 --> 01:13:08.255
He got that in the fight last night.

01:13:08.338 --> 01:13:11.090
That is a very deep cut.

01:13:11.924 --> 01:13:16.804
Will you be at the game? If I see
you in the stands, it make me feel better.

01:13:26.605 --> 01:13:28.649
Hey, Killer! Get 'em tonight!

01:13:30.443 --> 01:13:32.486
Fuckin' wearin' me out.

01:13:52.505 --> 01:13:54.883
- Reggie.
- Oh, hiya, honey! How are you?

01:13:55.800 --> 01:14:00.429
- You look a thousand years old.
- It was a long bus ride.

01:14:00.554 --> 01:14:02.849
- Did you listen to the game?
- Of course not.

01:14:02.932 --> 01:14:05.226
We got a new attitude!
It's bringin' success.

01:14:05.309 --> 01:14:07.936
- Well, any fool can fight.
- No, I swear to you.

01:14:08.020 --> 01:14:12.983
The Chiefs will be sittin' pretty in Florida
when this town is a stinkin' memory.

01:14:15.318 --> 01:14:18.489
You see, I personally
have been talkin' to the owner,

01:14:18.572 --> 01:14:20.616
which is why I've been
too busy to call you.

01:14:20.741 --> 01:14:23.284
Every wakin' hour
I'm on the phone with this guy...

01:14:23.368 --> 01:14:25.745
Reggie, Reggie. I'm moving.

01:14:25.870 --> 01:14:28.081
- What?
- To Long Island.

01:14:28.165 --> 01:14:31.417
A gal who works
in a shop there has a space open.

01:14:31.542 --> 01:14:33.919
Business here is just dead.

01:14:36.172 --> 01:14:38.049
Are you really goin'?

01:14:38.174 --> 01:14:41.343
You know, we have
to get divorced one of these days.

01:14:42.344 --> 01:14:46.265
I mean, I could meet somebody,
you could meet somebody, you know?

01:14:46.348 --> 01:14:48.809
Yeah?

01:14:48.934 --> 01:14:51.228
Well, don't look so sad.

01:14:57.275 --> 01:14:59.820
It's gonna be a big one!

01:14:59.903 --> 01:15:02.364
- See those guys?
- Reggie, look. I'm late.

01:15:02.489 --> 01:15:04.616
I'll write you when I get settled.

01:15:06.784 --> 01:15:09.871
Hey. I'll try to call you before you go.

01:15:17.962 --> 01:15:21.882
- It sucks!
- No, son. It looks nice and sells hockey.

01:15:22.007 --> 01:15:25.761
It ain't mean enough.
Put some blood in there.

01:15:25.845 --> 01:15:28.555
Show somebody gettin' hurt.
A groin injury.

01:15:28.639 --> 01:15:31.891
Put a fuckin' map of Florida
in the background. Get some tits in!

01:15:31.975 --> 01:15:33.685
Put a "For Sale" sign on the bottom.

01:15:33.811 --> 01:15:38.106
I don't want any tits
and I don't want any "For Sale" sign.

01:15:44.779 --> 01:15:46.989
Jesus.

01:15:47.073 --> 01:15:50.910
Remember that great
Peterborough game in... '68?

01:15:51.035 --> 01:15:53.662
Yeah. What about it?

01:15:53.871 --> 01:15:56.749
Jacky St. Pierre's wife left him.

01:15:56.833 --> 01:16:00.502
My God, it was snowing like hell
before we even got to the motel.

01:16:00.628 --> 01:16:04.631
- Yeah.
- Jacky had a whole keg sent in.

01:16:04.714 --> 01:16:09.261
Poor Jacky. He had a future.
I told him to watch that drunk drivin'.

01:16:09.344 --> 01:16:12.597
God, Joe, did we ever get shitfaced!

01:16:12.680 --> 01:16:17.143
And Jacky told everybody he was gonna
get Jill back even if he had to beg her.

01:16:17.227 --> 01:16:20.813
- I told him not to do that.
- Oh, I think he shoulda.

01:16:20.896 --> 01:16:22.941
She was a dynamite broad.

01:16:24.400 --> 01:16:27.278
- God, did we get shitfaced.
- I liked Jacky.

01:16:28.320 --> 01:16:30.948
- Yeah. He could've been great.
- Yeah.

01:16:33.492 --> 01:16:35.953
And remember
I went up to your room afterwards

01:16:36.036 --> 01:16:38.706
and you were dressed
in chick's clothes?

01:16:39.498 --> 01:16:42.834
Yeah, you had on
this black bra with tassels.

01:16:43.960 --> 01:16:48.674
You were dancing in front of a mirror
with this kinda zebra-skin jockstrap.

01:16:48.757 --> 01:16:52.177
Remember how I screamed at you
when you started comin' on to me

01:16:52.260 --> 01:16:55.263
and I just said "Jesus, stop it, Joe.
I'm ashamed of you."

01:16:55.347 --> 01:16:57.307
Damn you.

01:16:57.390 --> 01:16:59.934
I wanted to tell you
that I forgot the whole thing.

01:17:00.017 --> 01:17:03.021
Years have passed.
Now I'm sexually liberated.

01:17:03.146 --> 01:17:05.857
I don't care who's a fag no more.
I mean, who cares?

01:17:05.940 --> 01:17:08.859
It's natural. It's all around us.

01:17:10.528 --> 01:17:12.738
Who's the owner, Joe?

01:17:14.406 --> 01:17:18.535
He's probably calling Florida.
See how the sale is going.

01:17:18.953 --> 01:17:21.789
I was in Florida once, on a Southern tour,

01:17:21.872 --> 01:17:26.251
where I met this little redhead
who was an underwater specialist.

01:17:27.378 --> 01:17:32.423
The first thing she says to me
was "Come on out by the pool."

01:17:32.507 --> 01:17:37.804
So I went out, and she comes
leaping out with this banner,

01:17:37.887 --> 01:17:41.057
wearing nothing
but this little see-through wet suit.

01:17:42.516 --> 01:17:46.187
- Hey, Reg, I want a chair by the pool.
- I want some snatch by the pool.

01:17:46.270 --> 01:17:48.314
- Reg, you want a Coke?
- No, I can't.

01:17:48.397 --> 01:17:52.860
I'm tapin' an interview at the station.
They're playin' it at four. Don't miss it.

01:17:53.319 --> 01:17:57.364
That was some road trip. Six straight wins
and a whole new rash of penalty minutes.

01:17:57.447 --> 01:17:59.909
Well, we got a whole new attitude.

01:17:59.992 --> 01:18:03.078
What about the Hanson brothers?
They're not just bullies?

01:18:03.161 --> 01:18:06.247
Just bullies?
They scare the bejesus outta everybody!

01:18:06.372 --> 01:18:08.834
- Deliberately?
- Well...

01:18:10.377 --> 01:18:15.172
I'd like the folks to come down and watch
us cream them punks from Syracuse.

01:18:15.256 --> 01:18:17.550
Anything new on the sale of the Chiefs?

01:18:17.634 --> 01:18:22.596
I think the negotiations are...
you know, goin' pretty good.

01:18:22.721 --> 01:18:24.766
I have a personal announcement, though.

01:18:24.891 --> 01:18:28.394
I am placing a personal bounty
on the head of Tim McCracken.

01:18:28.519 --> 01:18:32.105
He's the coach
and chief punk on that Syracuse team.

01:18:32.189 --> 01:18:34.316
- A bounty?
- Yeah.

01:18:34.441 --> 01:18:39.320
A hundred bucks of my own money for
the first of my men that nails that creep.

01:18:39.446 --> 01:18:42.366
That's eight o'clock at the War Memorial,

01:18:42.449 --> 01:18:45.535
the Syracuse
and the all-new Charlestown Chiefs.

01:18:46.202 --> 01:18:48.412
- Thanks, Reg.
- Not to worry, kid.

01:18:48.788 --> 01:18:52.959
I'm placing a personal bounty
on the head of Tim McCracken.

01:18:53.042 --> 01:18:56.212
He's the coach
and chiefpunk on that Syracuse team.

01:18:56.337 --> 01:18:58.381
- A bounty?
- Yeah.

01:18:58.506 --> 01:19:02.259
A hundred bucks of my own money
for the first of my men that...

01:19:41.589 --> 01:19:43.549
- Yeah?
- Are you nuts?

01:19:43.674 --> 01:19:46.051
- Bullshit!
- A bounty!

01:19:46.510 --> 01:19:50.097
- We could all land in the clinker for this.
- Oh, big deal, Joe.

01:19:50.180 --> 01:19:52.641
You can't put a bounty on a man's head!

01:19:53.099 --> 01:19:55.144
I just did.

01:20:11.701 --> 01:20:13.494
- Yeah?
- Reg? It's Killer.

01:20:13.578 --> 01:20:16.830
- Oh. Hi, Killer.
- I want that $100.

01:20:17.122 --> 01:20:19.500
Well, you gotta earn it, Killer.

01:20:19.917 --> 01:20:22.586
- My attitude's right.
- Uh-huh. OK, kid.

01:20:41.896 --> 01:20:44.608
In-fucking-credible.

01:20:44.691 --> 01:20:46.734
Who is it?

01:20:49.403 --> 01:20:51.447
Yeah?

01:20:56.285 --> 01:20:58.662
- Hi.
- Hi.

01:20:58.745 --> 01:21:00.790
- What's up?

01:21:01.540 --> 01:21:03.333
Jesus.

01:21:03.417 --> 01:21:05.460
Come on in.

01:21:06.378 --> 01:21:09.798
- Well, I did it.
- You bet you did. You did, you bet.

01:21:11.591 --> 01:21:14.677
The wedding presents my side gave.
50-50, right?

01:21:14.802 --> 01:21:17.264
Can you get my clothes?

01:21:17.389 --> 01:21:19.516
Sure.

01:21:19.599 --> 01:21:21.642
Jesus, did you write him a note?

01:21:22.685 --> 01:21:24.813
Do you think I should have?

01:21:24.938 --> 01:21:27.148
I don't know.

01:21:27.231 --> 01:21:29.275
He's sure gonna think the worst.

01:21:32.778 --> 01:21:35.656
- Hey, Lily, we're gonna have a ball.
- We are?

01:21:37.032 --> 01:21:39.493
Except right now I gotta take a nap.

01:21:39.618 --> 01:21:43.622
I mean, I put a bounty on this guy's head.
If I don't get some shuteye...

01:21:46.958 --> 01:21:51.171
If I don't get some shuteye,
I'll get murdered out there on the ice.

01:21:51.254 --> 01:21:55.883
Otherwise I would've given you a night on
the town. We could've gone to the Aces.

01:21:55.967 --> 01:21:58.261
She won't mind. She's great to sleep with.

01:21:58.386 --> 01:22:00.346
Ned sleeps with her before every game.

01:22:00.430 --> 01:22:02.973
Her breathing makes him
feel more secure.

01:22:03.057 --> 01:22:05.267
Listen, Reg,
I'm gonna get a grip on myself.

01:22:05.350 --> 01:22:08.437
I'm gonna start using my imagination,
go with the traffic.

01:22:08.562 --> 01:22:12.149
I've been going about this all wrong.
I probably am terrific.

01:22:12.232 --> 01:22:14.277
You want some spaghetti?

01:22:15.236 --> 01:22:17.279
Reg?

01:22:32.877 --> 01:22:36.714
Run the siren.
Run the goddamn siren. I'm payin' for it.

01:22:36.797 --> 01:22:39.092
Let 'em know
there's gonna be blood in there.

01:22:39.175 --> 01:22:41.469
I can circle, but it's gonna cost you more.

01:22:41.552 --> 01:22:43.596
Oh, for Christ's sake.

01:22:44.680 --> 01:22:46.891
- There.

01:23:19.254 --> 01:23:21.716
Don't ever play "Lady of Spain" again!

01:23:23.426 --> 01:23:24.677
Jesus Christ.

01:23:37.022 --> 01:23:41.651
- Hey, McCracken.
- Dunlop, you suck cock.

01:23:41.734 --> 01:23:43.694
All I can get.

01:23:57.666 --> 01:24:02.296
$100 bounty on the head of famed
Syracuse stick man Tim McCracken.

01:24:02.421 --> 01:24:06.717
McCracken, also known as Dr. Hook for
his scalpel-like prowess with the stick,

01:24:06.842 --> 01:24:10.679
has been known to carve a man's eye out
with a flick of the wrist.

01:24:12.973 --> 01:24:15.266
There's a carnival-like atmosphere here.

01:24:15.350 --> 01:24:20.563
The crowd is gathered and, well, you can
feel it, there's an air of expectancy...

01:24:23.232 --> 01:24:26.903
Syracuse skating out now.
We're looking forward to a real contest.

01:24:26.986 --> 01:24:30.323
We're ready to face off in the
middle circle. The referee is ready.

01:24:30.406 --> 01:24:32.783
The linesmen for tonight...

01:24:42.960 --> 01:24:45.629
Go, Chiefs, go! Go, Chiefs, go!

01:24:52.469 --> 01:24:54.596
$100 says you're gonna crack my skull.

01:24:54.679 --> 01:24:57.933
- I wouldn't crack your knuckles for $100.
- So he's bluffin'.

01:24:58.058 --> 01:25:02.854
Somebody's gonna kill you, you dumb
son of a bitch, but it's not gonna be me.

01:25:31.507 --> 01:25:33.008
Good pass!

01:25:36.177 --> 01:25:38.137
Go on, man! Hit him!

01:25:38.221 --> 01:25:40.432
What's the matter with you?
You're a Chief!

01:25:40.557 --> 01:25:42.183
- Come on.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa!

01:25:42.267 --> 01:25:44.227
Fight back!

01:25:56.781 --> 01:25:59.324
You son of a bitch! Get over here!

01:25:59.408 --> 01:26:02.661
- Chickenshit yellow-belly.
- I scored, you fucking has-been.

01:26:02.786 --> 01:26:07.082
They don't want you to score goals.
They want blood. They're booin' you.

01:26:07.666 --> 01:26:09.626
Go get him, Killer!

01:26:12.713 --> 01:26:15.090
Come on, you son of a bitch. Come on!

01:26:16.674 --> 01:26:19.343
- Come on, Killer!
- We win cos I score goals.

01:26:19.427 --> 01:26:21.971
Oh, kiss my ass.
We win cos I make 'em crazy.

01:26:26.892 --> 01:26:29.020
- Nail him!
- You don't make me crazy.

01:26:29.145 --> 01:26:31.522
I will, cos you're benched.

01:26:31.897 --> 01:26:34.983
You want ice time, come and tell me
when you wanna play it my way.

01:26:35.108 --> 01:26:38.612
- You're the biggest pussy in the league.
- I like pussy.

01:26:38.696 --> 01:26:42.198
Oh, yeah? Well, that's not what
I hear from your wife. I hear...

01:26:55.336 --> 01:26:57.463
Go get him, Killer!

01:27:13.520 --> 01:27:16.606
Real old-fashioned guts,
for Dave "Killer" Carlson

01:27:16.731 --> 01:27:19.610
to jump into that fight
with Tim "Dr. Hook" McCracken.

01:27:19.693 --> 01:27:21.987
Ned Braden's come into the booth.
Sit down.

01:27:22.112 --> 01:27:24.489
I noticed
a slight discussion with Reg Dunlop.

01:27:24.614 --> 01:27:26.491
What are you doing? You been benched?

01:27:26.616 --> 01:27:29.327
Yes, a real first in my career.
I've been benched.

01:27:29.410 --> 01:27:31.454
- Why is that?
- I won't fight.

01:27:31.537 --> 01:27:35.583
- Well, you could play if you fought.
- Let's just say I'm chickenshit.

01:27:36.251 --> 01:27:41.130
Ned, why would someone with your
background still be playing hockey?

01:27:41.255 --> 01:27:42.632
- I hate my father.
- You do?

01:27:42.715 --> 01:27:44.925
- And I was having problems at home.
- You are?

01:27:45.009 --> 01:27:48.679
I just said I was. Primarily
sexual problems. I'm very perverse.

01:27:48.804 --> 01:27:51.599
- Holy shit!
- I skate to get away from my wife!

01:27:51.682 --> 01:27:55.185
- This is Jim Carr...
- We fight. She wants me to quit hockey.

01:27:59.189 --> 01:28:03.651
As you may have noticed, she's the only
good-looking piece of ass in Charlestown!

01:28:03.735 --> 01:28:07.239
She also has a drinking problem,
and I have no idea where she is.

01:28:07.364 --> 01:28:10.366
- Gimme that damn mike!
- Why do you wear that rug?

01:28:10.950 --> 01:28:12.910
It's just sensationally ugly.

01:28:12.993 --> 01:28:15.455
You're going bald.
Can't you face up to that?

01:28:15.538 --> 01:28:17.832
Well, at least I'm not chickenshit like you!

01:28:17.957 --> 01:28:20.000
What you're hearing is the truth!

01:28:20.084 --> 01:28:22.210
Jim Carr got angry...

01:28:23.588 --> 01:28:26.674
Joe McGrath here.
The boys like to horse around.

01:28:26.799 --> 01:28:29.009
- Chickenshit bastard!
- Sod off, old fart!

01:28:29.134 --> 01:28:32.888
- I may be bald, but I'm not chickenshit.
- I wanna talk about violence.

01:28:33.013 --> 01:28:36.599
- Chick, chick, chick!
- Gimme that!

01:28:36.725 --> 01:28:39.353
Son! Son!

01:28:43.314 --> 01:28:45.358
Take my guitar

01:28:45.441 --> 01:28:47.736
For board and room

01:28:48.611 --> 01:28:50.738
- Hey, Billy!

01:28:52.615 --> 01:28:56.536
Well, you're gonna be set, Lily.
Taking your destiny by the throat.

01:28:56.661 --> 01:28:58.871
You're in the driver's seat.

01:28:59.622 --> 01:29:02.958
You're not having
second thoughts about this, are you?

01:29:03.041 --> 01:29:06.211
Sometimes I think I get it.
Sometimes I think it's horseshit.

01:29:06.295 --> 01:29:10.131
Well, to doubt is human.
You stick with Reg. I'm on a roll.

01:29:11.382 --> 01:29:15.679
- Bye, Francine. Come back and see us.
- I will. Thank you, Mrs. Vincent.

01:29:18.431 --> 01:29:21.268
You're gonna need
another 10 or 15 minutes.

01:29:26.314 --> 01:29:28.107
- Hiya.
- Hi.

01:29:28.232 --> 01:29:30.860
This is Lily Braden, Ned Braden's wife.

01:29:30.943 --> 01:29:34.280
Well, actually she's... she's on waivers.

01:29:34.822 --> 01:29:37.658
Listen, she's in the market
for a perm and I said to her

01:29:37.742 --> 01:29:40.577
"Hey, there's no one better
than old Francine."

01:29:40.661 --> 01:29:43.747
- Well, I don't think...
- For the works. I'm buyin'.

01:29:43.872 --> 01:29:46.792
- I'll pay you back tomorrow.
- No, that's not the problem.

01:29:46.875 --> 01:29:48.835
You see, the problem is...

01:29:50.420 --> 01:29:53.090
I never laid a hand on her.
It was just a kid.

01:29:53.173 --> 01:29:56.343
Listen, it's a pathetic story. It's pathetic.

01:29:56.426 --> 01:29:58.386
You look terrific.

01:30:01.848 --> 01:30:03.808
Be careful, girls.

01:30:08.979 --> 01:30:12.316
- There's TV Radio Mirror, Modern Screen.
- You were married to him?

01:30:12.441 --> 01:30:15.319
For about a hundred years. It's all over.

01:30:16.320 --> 01:30:18.948
He's completely off his rocker.

01:30:19.031 --> 01:30:21.700
- I left my husband, too.
- Really?

01:30:22.326 --> 01:30:25.245
I'm only halfway out the revolving door,
know what I mean?

01:30:25.328 --> 01:30:29.583
Oh, it's lousy at first. You think
you're dying. But then it's fabulous.

01:30:29.666 --> 01:30:32.502
- I mean, you become a new woman.
- Yeah.

01:30:32.877 --> 01:30:37.090
You know, Reggie told me
you've gotten terrific since you left him.

01:30:38.049 --> 01:30:40.009
He said that?

01:30:43.304 --> 01:30:45.765
Well, you know what
you have to do for yourself?

01:30:45.890 --> 01:30:48.267
You have to get out there and circulate.

01:30:48.350 --> 01:30:52.813
I mean, you just can't sink into it. You
have to get out there on the firing line.

01:30:52.938 --> 01:30:55.149
- Oh, my God.
- No, no, no, no, no.

01:30:55.232 --> 01:30:57.192
Really. It's not bad. Look.

01:30:58.318 --> 01:31:03.532
If you did your cheekbones better,
you could look like Cher.

01:31:04.574 --> 01:31:06.617
Huh?

01:31:48.325 --> 01:31:51.077
- Amy, take this in the house.
- Hello there.

01:31:51.828 --> 01:31:55.831
Hiya. I'm Reg Dunlop. The Chiefs?
I came to see your husband.

01:31:56.166 --> 01:31:59.085
Oh, yes? I'm Anita McCambridge.
How do you do?

01:31:59.168 --> 01:32:01.295
- Hi.
- You think you can help with these?

01:32:01.420 --> 01:32:03.714
- Uh, yeah.
- Mom, I'm late, I gotta go.

01:32:03.797 --> 01:32:09.970
Michael, stay in the yard, put your jacket
on and carry one of these in first.

01:32:10.053 --> 01:32:12.013
Where's your husband?

01:32:12.138 --> 01:32:14.516
He's in puppy heaven.

01:32:17.519 --> 01:32:19.479
I own the Chiefs.

01:32:21.440 --> 01:32:23.400
This way.

01:32:33.951 --> 01:32:37.122
- What can I get you to drink?
- Canadian Club and water.

01:32:39.665 --> 01:32:42.042
- Nice place you've got here.
- Thanks.

01:32:44.044 --> 01:32:46.714
To tell the truth,
Mrs. McCambridge, the reason...

01:32:46.797 --> 01:32:48.841
Anita.

01:32:51.676 --> 01:32:53.637
OK, Anita.

01:32:53.762 --> 01:32:59.100
Uh... you know, we all read
about the possibility of a sale in Florida,

01:32:59.184 --> 01:33:02.604
and the guys are getting anxious
to find out what's going on.

01:33:02.729 --> 01:33:05.523
- Mm-hm.
- I guess I'm their representative.

01:33:08.609 --> 01:33:12.447
- We've been doin' real good.
- My accountant is certainly pleased.

01:33:12.572 --> 01:33:14.365
Oh. Uh...

01:33:14.448 --> 01:33:16.408
How is the sale goin'?

01:33:17.701 --> 01:33:19.662
Fine.

01:33:20.746 --> 01:33:23.707
- Oh. Good.
- You think you're gonna like Florida?

01:33:25.083 --> 01:33:27.128
Yeah.

01:33:31.631 --> 01:33:34.175
- Oh, you are very clever.
- What?

01:33:34.300 --> 01:33:38.388
It's been so much fun,
waiting to see what you're gonna do next.

01:33:38.471 --> 01:33:42.642
The articles in the paper
are very funny, that sports writer?

01:33:42.726 --> 01:33:45.728
- Dickie Dunn?
- You've certainly got his number.

01:33:46.312 --> 01:33:51.526
The radio interviews are fantastic,
and the Hanson brothers? Oh, my God!

01:33:51.609 --> 01:33:53.736
Well, attendance has quadrupled.

01:33:53.819 --> 01:33:56.739
Yes. I am in the black
for the first time in four years.

01:33:56.822 --> 01:34:01.535
- Hey, that's great.
- I guess I owe that to you. Thank you.

01:34:01.660 --> 01:34:04.329
You're welcome.
So, you can sell us real easy, then?

01:34:04.413 --> 01:34:08.459
- I could probably get some interest.
- Oh, boy. That's great!

01:34:08.876 --> 01:34:11.086
Oh, that's just great, Anita!

01:34:11.169 --> 01:34:14.505
You know, for five months now,
I've been tryin' to prove to you,

01:34:14.630 --> 01:34:18.385
without ever really knowing
who you were, that you were wrong,

01:34:18.468 --> 01:34:21.888
and that we could get somebody
interested in the Chiefs.

01:34:22.722 --> 01:34:25.016
We could sew that thing up tonight,
you know.

01:34:25.141 --> 01:34:28.477
- We oughta cream those guys!
- That's terrific.

01:34:28.602 --> 01:34:33.733
But I couldn't make enough of a profit
to have a sale be worthwhile.

01:34:34.775 --> 01:34:39.321
My accountant tells me I'm better off
folding the team, taking a tax loss.

01:34:41.574 --> 01:34:44.534
You mean,
you could sell us but you won't?

01:34:44.618 --> 01:34:46.661
I could probably sell you.

01:34:47.453 --> 01:34:49.414
But I can't.

01:34:53.960 --> 01:34:55.920
Oh.

01:34:56.630 --> 01:34:59.090
You know...

01:34:59.174 --> 01:35:01.134
We're human beings, you know.

01:35:03.969 --> 01:35:08.432
I have to confess that I've never let
the children watch a hockey game.

01:35:08.516 --> 01:35:12.728
I have a theory that children
imitate what they see on a TV screen.

01:35:13.604 --> 01:35:16.273
They see violence, they'll become violent.

01:35:16.357 --> 01:35:19.693
They see someone stick up a bank,
they'll stick up a bank.

01:35:19.818 --> 01:35:22.363
Heroin. You name it.

01:35:23.197 --> 01:35:25.407
- You're fucked.
- What?

01:35:25.490 --> 01:35:27.450
You are totally fucked.

01:35:28.868 --> 01:35:31.872
You're garbage
for letting us all go down the drain.

01:35:31.997 --> 01:35:35.500
- Are you serious?
- You could sell us. We're hot.

01:35:35.583 --> 01:35:38.253
People go nuts for us.
You could find a buyer.

01:35:38.336 --> 01:35:41.005
I don't think you understand finance.

01:35:50.347 --> 01:35:53.517
Your son looks like a fag to me.
You'd better get married again,

01:35:53.600 --> 01:35:56.770
cos he'll have somebody's cock
in his mouth before you know it.

01:35:56.895 --> 01:35:59.981
How dare you! How dare you!

01:36:02.109 --> 01:36:06.654
Our listeners'll be surprised to learn that
you're a soft-spoken young man, Killer.

01:36:06.780 --> 01:36:08.156
Yes, I am.

01:36:08.239 --> 01:36:10.867
I was watching some kids
play hockey the other day,

01:36:10.951 --> 01:36:13.328
five- and six-year-olds, little mites.

01:36:13.453 --> 01:36:15.580
One kid said "I'm Killer Carlson."

01:36:15.663 --> 01:36:18.833
He picked up his little stick,
and he creamed that other kid.

01:36:18.958 --> 01:36:20.752
How do you feel about that, Dave?

01:36:20.877 --> 01:36:24.922
Well, Jim, the way I see it is, the kid
probably would've done it anyway.

01:36:25.005 --> 01:36:26.966
Bad upbringing in the home.

01:36:27.049 --> 01:36:30.052
- That's very interesting.
- Can I be serious for a minute?

01:36:30.135 --> 01:36:31.637
By all means.

01:36:31.720 --> 01:36:35.057
Iâ€™d just like to say that,
no matter how the game turns out tonight,

01:36:35.182 --> 01:36:38.852
I owe all that I am
to our coach, Reg Dunlop.

01:36:38.977 --> 01:36:43.357
He's had the greatest influence on me,
aside of course from the Swami Baha,

01:36:43.482 --> 01:36:47.235
whose positive-thinking records
have been a tremendous help.

01:36:47.318 --> 01:36:49.278
- Positive-thinking records?
- Yeah.

01:36:49.403 --> 01:36:52.407
You can get 'em
in any religious record store.

01:36:52.532 --> 01:36:56.202
And I know that thousands of people
in Charlestown have lost their jobs,

01:36:56.285 --> 01:36:58.579
you know, with the mill closing and all.

01:36:58.704 --> 01:37:01.958
I see 'em walking around the streets
depressed all the time.

01:37:02.083 --> 01:37:05.169
Well, I just wanna say to all you
unemployed folks out there,

01:37:05.252 --> 01:37:07.922
you can get a new lease on life
with these records.

01:37:08.005 --> 01:37:10.466
Nothing'll bother you any more.

01:37:10.591 --> 01:37:13.426
You can go and clobber
the next guy in your business life.

01:37:13.510 --> 01:37:15.888
- That's very inspirational, Dave.
- Thanks.

01:37:15.971 --> 01:37:19.558
- Take care of yourself.
- Yeah. We're gonna win tonight...

01:37:19.641 --> 01:37:22.101
Jesus Christ. What a fuckin' nightmare.

01:37:56.885 --> 01:37:58.845
Braden!

01:38:02.890 --> 01:38:04.850
Ned!

01:38:05.810 --> 01:38:07.770
Hey!

01:38:19.740 --> 01:38:21.951
Kid?

01:38:24.995 --> 01:38:27.038
Hey, come on back!

01:38:27.122 --> 01:38:31.752
You don't have to fight if you don't wanna.
You can do whatever you wanna do.

01:38:35.463 --> 01:38:38.800
You know, I've had it with
the show business crap, too.

01:38:40.010 --> 01:38:43.179
I don't know what hit me!
I'm drivin' up here, and I say to myself

01:38:43.262 --> 01:38:45.222
"Who cares about Florida?"

01:38:45.347 --> 01:38:48.601
Screw the sale.
It's probably a bunch of crap anyway.

01:38:50.603 --> 01:38:52.563
No, that's bullshit.

01:38:52.688 --> 01:38:54.649
Hey?

01:38:55.483 --> 01:38:59.069
The team's history, kid.
There ain't no next year.

01:38:59.194 --> 01:39:02.782
I'm tits-up after this game
no matter what happens.

01:39:05.033 --> 01:39:06.993
But I'll tell you one thing.

01:39:08.244 --> 01:39:11.081
We're gonna win
that fuckin' championship tonight.

01:39:11.165 --> 01:39:13.458
But we're gonna win it fair and square.

01:39:13.542 --> 01:39:16.419
Old-time hockey,
none of this wrestling shit.

01:39:18.212 --> 01:39:20.757
You know? What the hell?
It's my last game.

01:39:20.840 --> 01:39:23.676
I'm gonna go out with style!
Play it straight!

01:39:26.428 --> 01:39:28.556
I'd like to have you there with me.

01:39:39.233 --> 01:39:42.736
Oh, uh... you know,
Lily's been staying at my place.

01:39:42.861 --> 01:39:44.822
She's a terrific gal.

01:39:48.992 --> 01:39:51.285
We've been havin' a hell of a time.

01:40:04.632 --> 01:40:06.592
Reg! Hey, Reg!

01:40:09.554 --> 01:40:12.097
- What?
- Want me to run in with stretchers?

01:40:12.222 --> 01:40:15.225
Get outta here, you goddamn parasite.

01:40:18.687 --> 01:40:23.900
This is Jim Carr. Jeff Hanson, I just can't
tell you the pleasure you've given us.

01:40:24.025 --> 01:40:26.486
I'd like to ask one question.
Win, lose or draw,

01:40:26.570 --> 01:40:29.322
this is the Chiefs'
last game before you leave.

01:40:29.405 --> 01:40:33.952
- Anything you want to say to Flood City?
- What do you mean, Flood City?

01:40:34.077 --> 01:40:36.621
Never mind, Jeff.
I guess that's before your time.

01:40:36.704 --> 01:40:39.165
Reg Dunlop! How about a statement?

01:40:39.290 --> 01:40:41.501
Good game, fella.
Good luck to you tonight.

01:40:41.584 --> 01:40:43.794
Reg Dunlop
has just asked us to come back...

01:40:43.920 --> 01:40:46.588
Girls! Outta here!

01:41:06.817 --> 01:41:08.777
No hittin'.

01:41:18.953 --> 01:41:22.623
The Chiefs are history, guys.
There ain't no Florida deal.

01:41:22.749 --> 01:41:25.543
Come on, Reg.
What are you talkin' about?

01:41:26.960 --> 01:41:30.881
I just made that shit up.
We're deader than this stinkin' town is.

01:41:32.132 --> 01:41:33.383
Dead history!

01:41:33.509 --> 01:41:36.928
I conned you guys. I just lied to you.

01:41:41.683 --> 01:41:45.436
We were never anything
but a rich broad's tax write-off.

01:41:45.561 --> 01:41:47.772
It made no difference
whether we won or lost.

01:41:47.897 --> 01:41:49.857
- Nail 'em!
- Kill 'em!

01:41:50.983 --> 01:41:54.654
You know, we ain't hockey players.
We've been clowns.

01:41:54.779 --> 01:41:58.908
We've been goons!
We're the freaks in a fuckin' sideshow.

01:41:58.991 --> 01:42:03.704
We're nothing but a bunch of criminals.
We oughta be in jail, that's all there is.

01:42:03.788 --> 01:42:07.624
- I'm ashamed.
- Not you, Coach?

01:42:07.749 --> 01:42:10.418
Yeah. Really ashamed of myself.

01:42:15.006 --> 01:42:16.966
See, Ned was right.

01:42:17.509 --> 01:42:20.929
Violence is killin' this sport.
It's draggin' it through the mud.

01:42:21.054 --> 01:42:26.017
If things keep up the way they are, hockey
players'll be nothing but actors, punks.

01:42:27.602 --> 01:42:29.979
Well, I'm not playin'
my last game that way.

01:42:30.104 --> 01:42:32.398
- Last game?
- Yeah.

01:42:32.481 --> 01:42:35.735
It's my last game,
and I wanna play it straight.

01:42:35.818 --> 01:42:38.904
No more "Nail 'em."
No more "Fuck with 'em." That's finished.

01:42:39.029 --> 01:42:42.866
I wanna win that championship tonight,
but I wanna win it clean.

01:42:42.949 --> 01:42:46.453
Old-time hockey,
like when I got started, you know?

01:42:48.038 --> 01:42:52.835
Jeez. Toe Blake, Dit Clapper,
Eddie Shore, those guys were the greats.

01:42:53.794 --> 01:42:56.671
I don't know what to say.
Christ, it's up to you.

01:43:09.267 --> 01:43:12.520
- Reg is our coach.
- Yeah, sure. Old-time hockey!

01:43:12.645 --> 01:43:14.605
- Like Eddie Shore.
- Yeah.

01:43:15.647 --> 01:43:17.608
Coach, our line starts?

01:43:18.859 --> 01:43:20.903
- Sure.
- Yeah!

01:43:20.986 --> 01:43:24.406
We got a game to win.
Everybody on the ice. Come on, guys.

01:43:28.535 --> 01:43:30.662
Evening, boys.

01:43:30.745 --> 01:43:35.000
Wimpy, how are ya?
Crash, how are you? Scotty.

01:43:35.083 --> 01:43:37.377
Better than Philadelphia this time!

01:43:38.211 --> 01:43:40.963
You're gonna eyeball
the new Charlestown Chiefs.

01:43:41.046 --> 01:43:45.218
Well, ladies and gentlemen, this has
all the earmarks of a hockey classic.

01:43:45.301 --> 01:43:50.348
The championship confrontation between
the Syracuse Bulldogs... Here they come!

01:43:50.431 --> 01:43:55.477
The rags-to-riches, Cinderella contenders
of the Federal League, the Chiefs!

01:44:10.909 --> 01:44:15.372
Let's go, Chiefs!
Let's go, Chiefs! Let's go, Chiefs!

01:44:15.497 --> 01:44:21.043
Let's go, Chiefs! Let's go, Chiefs!
Let's go, Chiefs! Let's go, Chiefs!

01:44:21.127 --> 01:44:23.671
Let's go, Chiefs! Let's go, Chiefs!

01:44:37.934 --> 01:44:40.312
I can't explain this delay.

01:44:40.437 --> 01:44:43.106
I don't know why Syracuse
elected to miss the warm-up.

01:44:43.190 --> 01:44:46.359
The Chiefs have already
skated over to their bench.

01:44:46.442 --> 01:44:50.488
Well, it just might be that Syracuse is
afraid to come out and face the Chiefs.

01:44:50.572 --> 01:44:52.532
Oh, thanks, Bill.

01:44:54.450 --> 01:44:56.494
Good heavens.

01:44:56.578 --> 01:44:59.330
I've just been handed the Syracuse roster,

01:44:59.413 --> 01:45:03.585
and it appears the Syracuse Bulldog
management is just real thirsty

01:45:03.668 --> 01:45:06.295
for a big, grudge-match type
victory here tonight.

01:45:06.379 --> 01:45:09.965
They've brought back,
just for this one contest, some colourful...

01:45:10.090 --> 01:45:14.011
Oh, and here they come now,
led by someone we all know very well,

01:45:14.136 --> 01:45:16.179
Tim "Dr. Hook" McCracken!

01:45:18.264 --> 01:45:22.269
And here's a name from the past.
Ross "Mad Dog" Madison!

01:45:22.352 --> 01:45:24.562
Ross, as you know,
never travels anywhere

01:45:24.687 --> 01:45:29.234
without his longtime friend and attorney,
Sam "Small Print" Lyman!

01:45:29.317 --> 01:45:34.530
Here's one for nostalgia fans! Clarence
"Screaming Buffalo" Swamptown!

01:45:34.613 --> 01:45:37.617
I'll never forget an interview
I did with him years ago,

01:45:37.742 --> 01:45:41.662
when Buffalo revealed he liked to call
his hockey stick "The Big Tomahawk".

01:45:41.745 --> 01:45:45.082
He usually refers to opposing
players as "The Little Scalps".

01:45:45.166 --> 01:45:48.335
I thought he'd been suspended for ever.

01:45:48.419 --> 01:45:51.213
Andre "Poodle" Lussier, defence.

01:45:51.296 --> 01:45:55.217
Andre, of course, has been living
in semi-seclusion in Northern Quebec

01:45:55.342 --> 01:45:58.428
ever since the unfortunate
Denny Pratt tragedy.

01:45:58.511 --> 01:46:00.054
Not Poodle!

01:46:00.138 --> 01:46:04.142
And from Mile Forty, Saskatchewan,
where he now runs a doughnut shop,

01:46:04.225 --> 01:46:08.396
number 15, former penalty-minute
record holder of the Federal League

01:46:08.479 --> 01:46:13.276
for the years 1960 to 1968 inclusive,
Gilmore Tuttle!

01:46:16.653 --> 01:46:18.698
Oh, gee. Hold the phone.

01:46:18.823 --> 01:46:21.116
This is an unscheduled surprise.

01:46:24.077 --> 01:46:25.078
It's him.

01:46:25.204 --> 01:46:28.957
This young man has had
a very trying rookie season,

01:46:29.041 --> 01:46:33.253
what with the litigation, the notoriety,
his subsequent deportation to Canada,

01:46:33.336 --> 01:46:35.797
and that country's refusal to accept him.

01:46:35.881 --> 01:46:38.591
That's more than
most 21-year-olds could handle.

01:46:38.675 --> 01:46:41.510
- Ogil-terp.
- Ogie Ogilthorpe!

01:46:58.694 --> 01:47:01.071
Hi, Ogie.

01:47:02.281 --> 01:47:04.825
Buy you a soda after the game?

01:47:06.702 --> 01:47:08.829
Hi. You know Toe Blake?

01:47:10.080 --> 01:47:12.040
No?

01:47:12.624 --> 01:47:15.377
We'll straighten you out, you little prick.

01:47:21.424 --> 01:47:23.468
How.

01:47:23.718 --> 01:47:27.305
- They don't call me Dr. Hook for nothing.
- How you doin'?

01:47:27.638 --> 01:47:31.684
All right, now. No high-sticking.
No tripping. No slashing.

01:47:31.768 --> 01:47:34.437
Major surgery. Open-heart.

01:47:34.520 --> 01:47:37.689
- I'm waitin' for quiet.
- Yeah, you'll have quiet.

01:47:44.154 --> 01:47:46.281
Give 'em hell!

01:47:52.746 --> 01:47:55.289
Give 'em the old-time hockey!

01:47:58.835 --> 01:48:01.212
- Good crowd.
- Shirley!

01:48:01.337 --> 01:48:03.882
- Teamwork! Teamwork! Teamwork!
- Eddie Shore!

01:48:04.007 --> 01:48:06.551
Come on! Get up! Get up!

01:48:07.009 --> 01:48:11.221
One with the universe.
One with the universe. Nothing matters.

01:48:11.305 --> 01:48:16.352
This reporter is stunned! The Charlestown
Chiefs are not fighting back!

01:48:26.861 --> 01:48:28.822
Keep the guys off me!

01:48:34.577 --> 01:48:36.203
You fuckin' moron!

01:48:36.496 --> 01:48:39.499
The Chiefs' performance has
to be a bitter disappointment

01:48:39.582 --> 01:48:43.961
to these 4,000-odd Charlestown fans
who have packed this War Memorial,

01:48:44.086 --> 01:48:47.840
paying good money
to witness this... this fiasco.

01:48:48.049 --> 01:48:50.092
Get Ogie!

01:48:50.175 --> 01:48:52.386
Move away, Wanchuk!
You're screening me.

01:48:52.511 --> 01:48:54.472
You're screening me! Move away!

01:48:55.389 --> 01:48:57.766
Give him some of that back!

01:48:58.183 --> 01:49:00.560
Don't let him push you like that!

01:49:12.655 --> 01:49:14.115
Come on!

01:49:17.535 --> 01:49:19.579
- Get up!
- Get off your ass!

01:49:19.662 --> 01:49:21.706
I don't know what's wrong.

01:49:24.958 --> 01:49:27.837
You bums! You're no damn good!

01:49:34.885 --> 01:49:37.512
Get up off your ass!

01:49:54.445 --> 01:49:58.115
- OK. Let's get some speed out there.
- Cement-heads.

01:49:58.240 --> 01:50:00.993
Keep your eyes open. Better passing.

01:50:01.077 --> 01:50:04.163
Better passing.
We got a big period coming up out there.

01:50:04.246 --> 01:50:08.542
Try to come back with the wingers,
maybe. Tonight's the night.

01:50:08.667 --> 01:50:11.670
- Who wants ice packs here?
- Charlie, over here!

01:50:14.089 --> 01:50:18.010
We need
some more coordination out there.

01:50:18.093 --> 01:50:21.929
- Keep your eyes open. Better passing.

01:50:25.392 --> 01:50:28.019
I'm comin'! I'm comin'!

01:50:28.102 --> 01:50:30.396
- All right. All right.
- Mother of God.

01:50:30.479 --> 01:50:33.107
I want a big rally this period. A big rally.

01:50:34.567 --> 01:50:37.194
- We're losin'!
- Teamwork, guys. More teamwork.

01:50:37.278 --> 01:50:39.489
They're buryin' us alive!

01:50:39.572 --> 01:50:41.782
- Eddie Shore?
- Oh, piss on Eddie Shore.

01:50:41.907 --> 01:50:44.618
- Old-time hockey?
- Piss on old-time hockey!

01:50:44.701 --> 01:50:47.788
You're blowin' it! Boys.

01:50:47.913 --> 01:50:53.210
Every scout in the NHL is out there tonight
with contracts in their pocket,

01:50:53.293 --> 01:50:56.463
and they're lookin' for talent, for winners!

01:50:56.588 --> 01:51:00.175
Oh! All my years of publicity!

01:51:00.300 --> 01:51:04.471
All the fashion shows,
the radiothons, for nothing?

01:51:04.554 --> 01:51:07.473
They come here tonight...

01:51:08.266 --> 01:51:10.976
to scout the Chiefs!

01:51:11.060 --> 01:51:13.938
The toughest team in the Federal League!

01:51:15.147 --> 01:51:18.484
Not this bunch of...

01:51:20.360 --> 01:51:22.321
pussies!

01:51:35.958 --> 01:51:37.919
Scouts?

01:51:54.894 --> 01:51:57.730
This is more like it.
It just makes me feel real glad

01:51:57.813 --> 01:52:01.734
to see the Chiefs back on the warpath
again... to coin a phrase.

01:52:05.028 --> 01:52:08.531
God, it's been a long time
since this place saw my shadow.

01:52:13.870 --> 01:52:18.041
- What am I doing here?
- You look fabulous. Now, come on.

01:52:26.883 --> 01:52:29.260
Oh, my God. I'd forgotten.

01:52:34.932 --> 01:52:38.977
Everybody is just on their feet screaming
"Kill! Kill! Kill!" This is hockey!

01:52:41.813 --> 01:52:43.065
Let's go, Chiefs!

01:53:08.256 --> 01:53:11.508
All right! Kill 'em!

01:53:29.776 --> 01:53:32.404
They're pummelling each other!
Wait a minute.

01:53:32.487 --> 01:53:36.157
Ned Braden is skating out
onto the centre of the ice. He...

01:53:43.289 --> 01:53:45.416
He's not fighting, no. He's...

01:53:53.757 --> 01:53:57.511
Ned Braden is starting
to take off articles of his uniform!

01:55:40.275 --> 01:55:41.777
Way to go, Ned. Way to go.

01:55:41.860 --> 01:55:46.407
I don't want any youngsters to get the
idea that this is the way to play hockey.

01:55:51.161 --> 01:55:53.372
Stop that! That's disgusting!

01:55:57.959 --> 01:56:00.629
- I protest!
- Protest? Protest what?

01:56:00.712 --> 01:56:05.841
I'm glad Mrs. Carr isn't here tonight,
because this is a lascivious display!

01:56:08.595 --> 01:56:11.055
Take it off!

01:56:11.806 --> 01:56:14.600
- Make him stop or we go!
- Get your paws off me, Scarface!

01:56:14.683 --> 01:56:17.520
Stop him! This is a serious game,
not a freak show!

01:56:17.603 --> 01:56:22.315
What do you mean, a serious game? What
are you talking about? This is hockey!

01:56:23.066 --> 01:56:26.820
- You're afraid of these goons, aren't you?
- Watch out, punk!

01:56:28.613 --> 01:56:32.534
- Get that pervert off the ice!
- Hands off me, or you forfeit the game.

01:56:32.659 --> 01:56:34.619
Forfeit, my ass! Look at that!

01:56:37.247 --> 01:56:39.707
All right. That's it. That's the game.

01:56:39.832 --> 01:56:43.753
- You lose.
- What are you talking about, lose?

01:56:43.836 --> 01:56:48.383
All right, come on, dummy, you won
the game. Come on, pick up your trophy.

01:56:53.262 --> 01:56:55.222
Here ya go, ya bum.

01:57:04.064 --> 01:57:08.151
The Chiefs have won
the championship of the Federal League!

01:57:08.485 --> 01:57:10.612
He's gonna catch his death out there.

01:57:32.883 --> 01:57:34.676
I said some bad things about the boy,

01:57:34.802 --> 01:57:38.305
but we can explain that to
the exuberance and excitement of youth,

01:57:38.431 --> 01:57:41.266
because he's certainly
changed his ways now.

01:57:44.894 --> 01:57:46.855
My boy!

01:58:15.882 --> 01:58:19.303
- Hi, Francine!
- Francine!

01:58:20.554 --> 01:58:23.098
Come on, honey!
You got all the room in the world.

01:58:23.223 --> 01:58:25.350
You ain't gonna hit anything. Come on!

01:58:29.145 --> 01:58:32.482
- I got good news!
- Honey, I'm paying by the hour for this.

01:58:32.565 --> 01:58:35.819
The Minnesota Night Hawks.
I'm coaching. The Big Apple!

01:58:35.944 --> 01:58:41.448
- Somebody's pulling a practical joke.
- No! I got a contract back there in the car.

01:58:41.532 --> 01:58:45.036
Hey, the Chiefs are history,
but the minute I get up to Minnesota,

01:58:45.161 --> 01:58:47.454
I'm gonna bring my guys up there.

01:58:47.538 --> 01:58:52.751
I mean, we're a solid act, honey.
We're starting out with something big.

01:58:52.835 --> 01:58:54.795
- Oh, Jesus!
- What?

01:58:55.921 --> 01:58:58.381
You don't have my number.

01:58:58.506 --> 01:59:01.760
If you wanna get in touch with me,
just do it through the team.

01:59:01.885 --> 01:59:04.596
The Minnesota Night Hawks,
remember? OK?

01:59:04.679 --> 01:59:07.223
You could need
some money or something, or...

01:59:07.306 --> 01:59:11.060
Well, maybe things just
won't work out the way you expect.

01:59:11.144 --> 01:59:14.063
Jeez, we got a lot of years
between us, Francine.

01:59:14.146 --> 01:59:16.107
- Some hard miles, you know?
- I know.

01:59:16.191 --> 01:59:19.860
- Oh, shut up, you goddamn meathead!

01:59:19.944 --> 01:59:22.488
- Honey, I gotta go.
- You gotta go.

01:59:22.571 --> 01:59:26.742
Listen, if things don't work out, you can
get in touch with me in Minneapolis.

01:59:26.826 --> 01:59:30.078
- Bye, Reggie.
- I could make a goddamn fortune.

01:59:52.850 --> 01:59:55.936
- Is she comin' to Minnesota?
- For sure!
