00:08.443 --> 00:11.620
Previously on
Star Trek: Picard... When you first learned

00:11.663 --> 00:13.230
that the Romulan sun
was going to explode,

00:13.274 --> 00:16.190
you left the Enterprise
to command the rescue armada,

00:16.233 --> 00:20.107
a mission to relocate
900 million Romulan citizens

00:20.150 --> 00:22.457
to worlds outside
the blast of the supernova.

00:22.500 --> 00:24.067
The decision to call off
the rescue

00:24.111 --> 00:27.157
and to abandon those people
we had sworn to save

00:27.201 --> 00:29.246
was not just dishonorable.

00:29.290 --> 00:30.900
It was downright criminal!

00:30.943 --> 00:32.293
The daughter of the man

00:32.336 --> 00:34.077
whose death
I have been mourning

00:37.298 --> 00:39.865
And then she is assassinated

00:39.909 --> 00:42.085
by a Romulan death squad
who will then

00:42.129 --> 00:44.914
go and try and
find and destroy

00:44.957 --> 00:46.220
her twin sister.

00:46.263 --> 00:48.048
I have to find Bruce Maddox.

00:48.091 --> 00:49.919
I found Maddox.

00:49.962 --> 00:51.312
Bruce Maddox is on Freecloud.

00:51.355 --> 00:53.618
And once we get there,
you're on your own.

00:53.662 --> 00:55.229
Why do you want to go
to Freecloud?

00:55.272 --> 00:56.317
Have we met?

00:56.360 --> 00:57.840
Agnes Jurati.

00:57.883 --> 00:59.972

The Three Musketeers

02:57.394 --> 02:59.135
by Alexandre Dumas.

03:01.355 --> 03:04.445
Enjoy. You're making the admiral
uncomfortable, Elnor.

03:04.488 --> 03:06.186
He dislikes displays of emotion.

03:06.229 --> 03:07.535
And he's not overly fond
of children.

03:07.578 --> 03:09.406
Not at all.

03:09.450 --> 03:14.411
Someday, I may get used to

03:14.455 --> 03:16.935
Wh-Why don't you like children?

03:16.979 --> 03:19.242
Because they're demanding,
distracting and interfere

03:19.286 --> 03:21.288
with duty
and pleasure alike.

03:22.941 --> 03:25.466
My feelings are hurt.

03:25.509 --> 03:27.468
I actually did think
you were fond of me.

03:28.469 --> 03:30.949
Correct.

03:30.993 --> 03:34.344
I like you very much.

The sisters

tell us things went well there.

03:37.869 --> 03:39.523
10,000 new refugees.

03:39.567 --> 03:42.091
The help of the sisters
was invaluable.

03:42.134 --> 03:44.920
The Federation owes a
debt to the Qowat Milat.

03:44.963 --> 03:46.313
How long can you stay?

As always, our house

Can I read the book? Yes. Of course.

03:54.146 --> 03:57.280
But in three days,
I have to be in Central Station

03:57.324 --> 03:59.282
to meet the next convoy.

03:59.326 --> 04:01.284
Because last time,
you promised that...

04:01.328 --> 04:03.243
A promise is a prison, Elnor.

04:03.286 --> 04:05.375
Do not make yourself
another's jailer.

04:05.419 --> 04:07.551
And that reminds
me, Zani.

04:07.595 --> 04:10.859
Last time, I made you a promise

04:10.902 --> 04:16.168
that I would try and find
some sweet hanifak.

04:16.212 --> 04:17.560
But I totally forgot

04:17.605 --> 04:19.563
that promises
were prisons, so...

04:19.607 --> 04:21.826
Ah-ah-ah.

04:23.219 --> 04:25.526
It can't be easy

04:25.569 --> 04:28.137
being the only boy

04:28.180 --> 04:29.312
in a house of women.

04:29.356 --> 04:31.793
He must get
lonely sometimes.

04:31.836 --> 04:33.273
Yes.

04:33.316 --> 04:37.929
He is loved,
but he does not belong with us.

04:37.973 --> 04:39.801
I understand.

04:39.844 --> 04:42.586
It's so good of you
to have taken him in

04:42.630 --> 04:44.196
the way that you have.

04:46.024 --> 04:50.855

there are over three billion
stars in our galaxy alone

There are a septillion

I watered your plants.
You're welcome.

I was gonna watch a holo,

09:12.334 --> 09:14.336
all you have on board
is Klingon opera.

09:15.598 --> 09:18.253
Long story.

09:19.907 --> 09:22.300
I used to live with a guy
who liked paper books.

09:22.344 --> 09:23.519
I bothered him, too.

09:25.434 --> 09:27.567
What did he used to do about it?

09:28.611 --> 09:30.265
He was my dad.

09:32.006 --> 09:34.878
He had to put up with it.

09:34.922 --> 09:38.360
What's your book about?

09:38.403 --> 09:42.843
The existential pain of living
with the consciousness of death,

09:42.886 --> 09:45.323
and how it defines us
as human beings.

09:49.414 --> 09:51.895
Well, that's not
a conversation killer at all.

09:51.939 --> 09:54.071
I totally want to talk about
the existential pain

09:54.115 --> 09:55.986

10:06.388 --> 10:08.216
What stop?

10:08.259 --> 10:09.521
Vashti, in the Qiris sector.

10:09.565 --> 10:11.306
Vashti.

10:11.349 --> 10:15.136
Man can't even take a guilt trip
without using a starship.

10:22.622 --> 10:23.927
Hold.

10:23.971 --> 10:26.147
Holomatrix paused.

10:26.190 --> 10:28.889
Is it inaccurate?

10:31.500 --> 10:34.938
Everything seems
absolutely correct,

10:34.982 --> 10:37.811
in every particular.

10:37.854 --> 10:40.378
We rebuilt your study to
the exact specifications.

10:40.422 --> 10:42.293
I see that.

10:42.337 --> 10:45.122
Your Mr. Zhaban supplied me
with the holoscans.

10:45.166 --> 10:47.864
He thought you might
feel more at home.

10:50.301 --> 10:53.043
It seems a little odd
that a working ship

10:53.087 --> 10:55.263
should have a
hospitality hologram.

10:55.306 --> 10:58.179
I came with the basic
installation, sir,

10:58.222 --> 10:59.963
but you're right,

11:00.007 --> 11:03.053
hospitality emergencies
are rare on this vessel.Mm-hmm.

11:03.097 --> 11:06.927
In general, the captain...
keeps his own company.

11:08.145 --> 11:09.886
Come.

11:09.930 --> 11:11.975
You want to go to Vashti?

11:12.019 --> 11:14.195
Are you out of
your goddamn mind?

11:18.286 --> 11:20.331
I hate that fucking
hospitality hologram.

11:24.118 --> 11:26.337
That you even
suggest it makes me

11:26.381 --> 11:28.470
seriously question
your mental state.

11:28.513 --> 11:30.254
The idea of going there
isn't just

11:30.298 --> 11:32.300
a bad idea,
it's-it's bizarre.

11:32.343 --> 11:33.562
Look,

11:33.605 --> 11:35.869
Dahj's sister
is in grave danger.

11:35.912 --> 11:37.784
She may already be dead.

11:37.827 --> 11:39.481

11:39.524 --> 11:42.266

11:45.922 --> 11:48.533
Do-do I seem
eager to you?

11:48.577 --> 11:50.448
I would say more...

11:50.492 --> 11:52.407
apprehensive.

11:52.450 --> 11:55.323
Look, I-I'm gonna be
straight with you.

11:55.366 --> 11:58.021
Oh, well, that will make
a refreshing change.

11:58.065 --> 11:59.980
Come.

12:00.023 --> 12:02.417
Oh, uh,

12:02.460 --> 12:04.158
is this a secret meeting,

12:04.201 --> 12:05.812
or am I technically

12:05.855 --> 12:07.117
part of the crew now?

12:07.161 --> 12:08.858
Please, Dr. Jurati,
join us.

12:08.902 --> 12:10.251
Raffi here was

12:10.294 --> 12:12.079
questioning my sanity.

12:12.122 --> 12:15.778
You know what? Fine.
Let's go to Vashti.

12:15.822 --> 12:17.911
Check out that
big statue of you.

12:17.954 --> 12:20.087
I mean, they-they must've
put up at least one.

12:20.130 --> 12:21.828
If they did,
somebody's probably

12:21.871 --> 12:22.872
stolen it by now.

12:22.916 --> 12:25.266
Qiris sector's
sketchy nowadays.

12:25.309 --> 12:26.789
Serious power vacuum.

12:26.833 --> 12:28.356
Smugglers and petty warlords,
like Kar Kantar,

12:28.399 --> 12:29.749
basically run the show.

12:29.792 --> 12:32.621
Kantar got hold of an
antique Bird-of-Prey somewhere

12:32.664 --> 12:34.797
and has been running wild

12:34.841 --> 12:36.059
from Vashti
to Daimanta.

12:36.103 --> 12:38.235
You didn't already
tell him this?

12:38.279 --> 12:39.541
He said,

12:39.584 --> 12:42.152
"Lay in a course
for Vashti, Rios,"

12:42.196 --> 12:43.327
and, what,
you just obeyed,

12:43.371 --> 12:44.981
like a good Starfleet officer?

12:45.025 --> 12:47.462
I assumed he knew.

12:47.505 --> 12:50.987
But the Qiris sector is in
the Fenris Rangers' territory.

12:51.031 --> 12:54.338
Was. The Rangers just do not
have the resources

12:54.382 --> 12:56.819
to keep up with the chaos
out there anymore.

12:56.863 --> 12:59.300
Also,
Vashti is a hotbed for the Romulan

12:59.343 --> 13:00.823
Rebirth movement.

13:00.867 --> 13:02.607
But you're just
gonna drop in

13:02.651 --> 13:04.261
and pick yourself up a nun.

13:04.305 --> 13:07.395
O-Okay, well,
now somebody has to tell me

13:07.438 --> 13:08.570
what we're talking about.

13:08.613 --> 13:10.964
JL wants to hire an assassin.

13:11.007 --> 13:14.184
They are not assassins,
and you can't hire them.

13:14.228 --> 13:17.187
The Qowat Milat
have to choose you.

13:17.231 --> 13:19.320
Romulan warrior nuns.

13:20.364 --> 13:21.539
That's a real thing?

13:21.583 --> 13:22.627
How bizarre.

13:22.671 --> 13:24.891
I know...

13:24.934 --> 13:28.329
knew some Qowat Milat.

13:28.372 --> 13:32.942
On Vashti alone, they helped
Raffi and me relocate

13:32.986 --> 13:35.902
more than a quarter
of a million refugees.

13:35.945 --> 13:38.078

the most skilled

13:38.121 --> 13:41.211
single-combat fighters
that I have ever seen

13:41.255 --> 13:44.258

13:44.301 --> 13:45.955

What-what makes you think
they're gonna help you now?

13:50.264 --> 13:54.442
They have their own criterion
whether to give or withhold

13:54.485 --> 13:56.923
their assistance to a cause.

13:56.966 --> 13:58.838
And what is that?

14:00.274 --> 14:02.276
Let's just say that

14:02.319 --> 14:05.279
I am confident that they
will find ours worthy,

14:05.322 --> 14:06.584
and if they don't,

14:06.628 --> 14:08.935
the Way of Absolute Candor

14:08.978 --> 14:11.633

hesitate to tell us.

14:11.676 --> 14:14.810
What's the Way of
Absolute Candor?

14:14.854 --> 14:16.464
It's their primary teaching:

14:16.507 --> 14:19.815
total communication of emotion

14:19.859 --> 14:23.079
without any filter
between thought and word.

14:23.123 --> 14:25.603
And it runs entirely
counter to everything

hold dear.

He completed
his training?

27:17.070 --> 27:19.725
Last spring.

27:19.768 --> 27:22.031
So he really is
a Qowat Milat?

27:22.075 --> 27:25.469
No. And as a man,
he never can be.

27:25.513 --> 27:28.385
But he is open-hearted,

27:28.429 --> 27:30.431
and apart from this display
of the reticence

27:30.474 --> 27:33.826
you always seemed
to inspire in him, forthright.

27:33.869 --> 27:37.090
And his fighting skills
are truly formidable.

27:37.133 --> 27:40.702
And you would send him away?

27:40.746 --> 27:44.358

in serious danger.

27:44.401 --> 27:47.404
He might die.

27:47.448 --> 27:49.232
He will.

27:51.365 --> 27:54.194
Before that comes to pass,

27:54.237 --> 27:56.849
it would gladden my heart

28:09.688 --> 28:11.777
When you bind
your sword to a cause,

28:11.820 --> 28:13.604

28:35.539 --> 28:37.019

28:38.760 --> 28:41.807

28:41.850 --> 28:44.461

ever since.

28:44.505 --> 28:46.463

28:46.507 --> 28:48.509
Of course I did.

28:50.598 --> 28:52.861
Continue.

28:52.905 --> 28:56.125
Well, recently,
I've learned that Data...

28:56.169 --> 28:58.388
this is complicated...

28:58.432 --> 29:01.478
that Data had
two offspring.

29:01.522 --> 29:04.438
And one of them...
her name was "Dahj"...

29:04.481 --> 29:06.657
was murdered in front of me.

29:06.701 --> 29:09.008
The other one, I believe,
is in serious danger.

29:09.051 --> 29:11.793
And I have to find her
before the Tal Shiar do.

29:11.837 --> 29:14.796
The Tal Shiar? Yes.

29:14.840 --> 29:16.755
And this other sister...
is she an android?

29:16.798 --> 29:18.495
Mm-hmm.

29:18.539 --> 29:20.802
You told me stories
about Data.

29:20.846 --> 29:22.891
He had an orange
cat named Spot.

29:22.935 --> 29:25.546
That's right.

29:25.589 --> 29:27.548
I've still never
seen a cat.

29:27.591 --> 29:29.680
Well, if you come with us,

29:29.724 --> 29:32.422
you might just run across
one or two of them.

29:32.466 --> 29:34.424
Why do you need me?

29:34.468 --> 29:37.950
Because I failed
to protect her sister.

29:37.993 --> 29:40.517
But you don't know where she is
or if she's even alive.

29:40.561 --> 29:42.650
No.What about the man
who built her?

29:42.693 --> 29:44.826
It's just a guess. Are you being pursued?

29:44.870 --> 29:47.655
Likely.

29:47.698 --> 29:49.831
Anticipated, actually.

29:49.875 --> 29:52.703
All that is
why you need someone.

29:53.922 --> 29:56.533
Why do you need me?

29:58.492 --> 30:00.929
Because I'm an old man
and you're a young one,

30:00.973 --> 30:02.496
and you're strong.

30:02.539 --> 30:05.151
Zani told me that

30:05.194 --> 30:09.155
you are one of the best fighters
that she has ever seen.

30:09.198 --> 30:11.984
It seems to me
that my quest

30:12.027 --> 30:15.465
has the appropriate criterion.

30:15.509 --> 30:17.424
Will you come with me?

30:17.467 --> 30:21.080
Will you bind your sword
to my quest?

30:21.123 --> 30:24.692
Now that you have use for me?

30:24.735 --> 30:26.781
Now that I have value to you?

30:26.825 --> 30:28.652
You left me

30:28.696 --> 30:30.872
on my own, old man. I never meant to...

30:30.916 --> 30:32.656
I see no reason
not to do the same.

30:32.700 --> 30:34.702
Elnor, it...!

30:41.752 --> 30:43.015
Rios, it's Picard.

30:43.058 --> 30:44.843
I'm ready for transport.

30:44.886 --> 30:46.453
Copy that.

30:46.496 --> 30:48.759
Next window opens
in seven minutes.

32:09.536 --> 32:11.146
You may call me
gTenqem Adrev.

32:11.190 --> 32:12.887
We met before.

32:12.931 --> 32:14.671
Once.

32:14.715 --> 32:17.413
Have we? Forgive me. I, uh...

32:17.457 --> 32:19.459
Oh, it was
in another lifetime,

32:19.502 --> 32:22.549
when I was another man.

32:22.592 --> 32:25.682
A Romulan senator,
if you can believe it.

32:25.726 --> 32:28.033
I had the honor
of being present

32:28.076 --> 32:30.600
the day you addressed
the Hall of State,

32:30.644 --> 32:33.647
the very embodiment
of Starfleet,

32:33.690 --> 32:37.346
making such eloquent
and generous promises

32:37.390 --> 32:40.480
on behalf of
the magnanimous Federation.

32:40.523 --> 32:42.961
The great Saint Picard.

32:43.004 --> 32:44.397
Senator...

32:44.440 --> 32:46.442
I found it
extremely moving.

32:46.486 --> 32:49.445
How very touched we all were.

32:49.489 --> 32:52.492
There were tears
in my eyes.

32:52.535 --> 32:54.494
Thank you.

32:54.537 --> 32:56.626
And then you went away.

32:56.670 --> 32:59.978
And when you returned,
you brought the ships.

33:00.021 --> 33:04.721
Those great big
Wallenberg-class transports.

33:04.765 --> 33:08.073
We all packed
and boarded the Nightingale,

33:08.116 --> 33:10.684
five generations of parents
and grandparents,

33:10.727 --> 33:13.556
siblings and spouses
and children.

33:13.600 --> 33:17.038
And the Nightingale
brought us here,

33:17.082 --> 33:19.432
to Vashti.

33:19.475 --> 33:22.826
We had so little time.

33:24.828 --> 33:27.092
There were so many of you
to save.

33:27.135 --> 33:29.790
And so little to be expected
from Starfleet.

33:29.833 --> 33:31.966
I did everything I could.

33:32.010 --> 33:33.446
And then you gave up.

33:34.708 --> 33:36.449
Skantal!

33:36.492 --> 33:38.364
Bidran!

33:48.461 --> 33:50.724
No one asked
for your pity, Picard.

33:50.767 --> 33:53.118
Just as no one asked
for your help.

33:53.161 --> 33:55.685
You and Starfleet
had no understanding

33:55.729 --> 33:58.949
of Romulan ingenuity, resolve,
self-sufficiency.

33:58.993 --> 34:00.995
You took advantage of us
at the very moment

34:01.039 --> 34:02.649
where we doubted
ourselves,

34:02.692 --> 34:04.477
enticed us
with your empty promises,

34:04.520 --> 34:06.000
and did everything in your power

34:06.044 --> 34:08.784
to scatter,
confuse and divide us.

34:08.829 --> 34:10.831
That is not so!

34:12.005 --> 34:13.659
I promise you...

34:13.703 --> 34:15.661
You promise?!

34:15.705 --> 34:17.533
You promise?

34:19.708 --> 34:21.581
Give him your sword.

34:25.628 --> 34:27.369
No.

34:33.462 --> 34:34.855
Come on.

34:47.085 --> 34:48.998
No!

34:49.043 --> 34:50.043
Please, my friend.

34:52.568 --> 34:54.918
Choose to live.

35:07.888 --> 35:09.933
I regret your choice.

35:26.689 --> 35:28.474
Enough, Elnor.

35:29.997 --> 35:33.522
The Federation
has failed you all.

35:34.871 --> 35:37.439
I failed you all.

35:37.483 --> 35:41.400
I... broke faith with you,

35:41.443 --> 35:45.447
and the result was

35:45.491 --> 35:47.623
terrible...

35:47.667 --> 35:52.411
pain and loss for you all.

35:54.413 --> 35:56.502
And I am sorry.

36:03.726 --> 36:05.554
Picard, ready for transport.

36:06.686 --> 36:08.775
A tan qalanq
is no match

36:08.818 --> 36:10.646
- for a disruptor,
sisterboy. - JL?

36:10.690 --> 36:12.431
Yes! Now!

36:18.132 --> 36:20.569
That man did not
deserve to die.

36:20.613 --> 36:22.441
Yet he chose it.
Fight a Qowat Milat,

36:22.484 --> 36:24.007
and the outcome
is not in doubt.

36:24.051 --> 36:26.662
Now, you listen
to me, carefully.

36:26.706 --> 36:28.925
I will benefit
by your skill and your courage,

36:28.969 --> 36:31.014
but if you bind yourself
to my cause,

36:31.058 --> 36:34.496
I will tell you when to fight
and when to refrain.

36:34.540 --> 36:36.411
Is that understood?

36:37.673 --> 36:38.805
Yes.

36:38.848 --> 36:40.459
Swear it.

36:40.502 --> 36:42.069
I swear.

36:48.989 --> 36:53.515
Dr. Jurati, Raffi,
this is Elnor.

36:54.516 --> 36:57.824
A boy with a stick.

36:57.867 --> 37:00.348
I have to ask you,
what made you decide

37:00.392 --> 37:02.742
to bind yourself
to my cause?

37:02.785 --> 37:05.745
It met the requirements
for worthiness.

37:05.788 --> 37:08.443
And it seemed like
you needed me after all.

37:08.487 --> 37:10.532
What is the requirement
for worthiness?

37:10.576 --> 37:12.795
A qalankhkai would
only bind herself...

37:12.839 --> 37:14.841
himself... to a lost cause.

37:35.383 --> 37:36.689
What?

37:36.732 --> 37:38.908
Did you think
it was your robot friend?

37:41.389 --> 37:44.523
I take it she's
anatomically correct.

37:47.830 --> 37:49.832
It makes perfect sense.

37:49.876 --> 37:52.792
You've been studying her kind
your whole adult life.

37:52.835 --> 37:54.576
Waiting for her.

37:54.620 --> 37:56.535
Planning for her.

37:56.578 --> 38:00.452
Wondering what it would be like
when you finally saw her.

38:00.495 --> 38:02.802
Now here she is.

38:02.845 --> 38:04.804
Why is she obsessed with Ramdha?

38:04.847 --> 38:07.067
What happened when the cube
assimilated the Shaenor?

38:07.110 --> 38:09.852
Why did its crew and passengers
lose their minds?

38:09.896 --> 38:11.593
Who were they?

38:11.637 --> 38:14.727
What have you accomplished
on my behalf?

38:14.770 --> 38:17.860
I've planted
the first seed of doubt.

38:17.904 --> 38:19.688
Really?

38:19.732 --> 38:22.038
One whole seed.

38:22.082 --> 38:24.084
Impressive. I know

38:24.127 --> 38:25.694
how to handle her.

38:25.738 --> 38:29.132
If I press her too hard,
it might activate her.

38:29.176 --> 38:31.526
And then we'll have another
situation like on Earth,

38:31.570 --> 38:32.875
and then they'll both be dead.

38:32.919 --> 38:34.442
That is the goal, you know.

38:34.486 --> 38:35.791
To kill them.

38:35.835 --> 38:37.619
Yes, all of them.

38:37.663 --> 38:39.795
Which is something I can't do

38:39.839 --> 38:42.450
until we find out
where she came from

38:42.494 --> 38:44.713
and where the rest of them are.

38:44.757 --> 38:47.716
And in the meantime...

38:47.760 --> 38:50.937
you slide ever deeper
into your own obsession.

38:52.417 --> 38:55.071
Have you entertained
for even a moment

38:55.115 --> 38:58.379
that she might be the one
handling you?

39:00.555 --> 39:03.428
She was sent to this cube
for a reason.

39:04.777 --> 39:07.475
Your little robot girl
has a plan.

39:07.519 --> 39:10.043
Don't forget that.

39:10.086 --> 39:11.740
I know full well...

39:11.784 --> 39:13.786
Who is she, Narek?

39:22.708 --> 39:24.449
Who...

39:24.492 --> 39:26.015
is she?

39:32.587 --> 39:34.763
Seb-Cheneb.

39:36.635 --> 39:38.506
The Destroyer.

39:50.039 --> 39:52.390
I'll give you and your seed
one more week.

39:53.782 --> 39:56.045
After that,
if I don't have the location,

39:56.089 --> 39:57.960
we go back to good old...

39:58.004 --> 39:59.788
pain and violence.

40:13.498 --> 40:14.890
It's Kantar!

40:14.934 --> 40:17.415
Near miss. Hold on.

40:17.458 --> 40:19.460
Engaging auto-evasion protocol.

40:28.034 --> 40:30.166
That old heap's
targeting system is primitive,

40:30.210 --> 40:33.169
but the planetary security net
worries me.

40:33.213 --> 40:35.563
Just get us the
hell out of here.

40:45.617 --> 40:46.618
Shield strength at 89%.

40:46.661 --> 40:47.967
Can you go faster

40:48.010 --> 40:49.708
than that Bird-of-Prey?
Maybe not outrun him,

40:49.751 --> 40:52.145
but I can definitely outfly him.
We-we should be...

41:01.110 --> 41:02.460
Weapons online.

41:21.043 --> 41:22.480
Hold on.

41:28.007 --> 41:31.401
Launching
additional power to thrusters.

41:36.494 --> 41:38.539
Routing additional power
to inertial dampener.

41:49.942 --> 41:51.987
Where did that come from?

41:52.031 --> 41:53.075
Trying to get a read.

41:54.120 --> 41:55.382
No ID,

41:55.425 --> 41:56.688
no transponder.

41:56.731 --> 41:59.473
Great timing, though.

42:13.400 --> 42:14.532
Bastard.

42:18.536 --> 42:20.146
That pilot's hailing us, JL.

42:20.189 --> 42:21.539
Open a channel.

42:21.582 --> 42:22.583
Uh...

42:24.585 --> 42:27.066
Open the channel.
Put him on.

42:28.633 --> 42:30.591
He's asking permission
to beam over.

42:30.635 --> 42:31.940
His ship's breaking up.

42:33.202 --> 42:34.595
Nah, too risky.

42:34.639 --> 42:35.640
His shields are failing.

42:35.683 --> 42:36.902
Raffi, beam him in,

42:36.945 --> 42:38.686
directly here. Do it.

42:40.645 --> 42:43.038
Elnor.

42:48.087 --> 42:49.131
Got him.

42:58.401 --> 43:00.839
Seven of Nine?

43:02.449 --> 43:04.973
You owe me a ship, Picard.
