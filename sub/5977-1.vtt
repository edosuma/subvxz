00:30.797 --> 00:32.265
<i>Ever had one of those nights</i>

00:32.266 --> 00:36.976
<i>that starts out like any other, but ends
up being the best night of your life?</i>

00:41.208 --> 00:45.816
<i>It was June the 22nd,
1990, our final day of school.</i>

00:46.046 --> 00:52.088
<i>There was Oliver Chamberlain, Peter Page,
Steven Prince, Andy Knightley and me.</i>

00:52.553 --> 00:56.968
<i>They called me The King.
Because my name's Gary King.</i>

00:57.291 --> 01:01.961
<i>Ollie was funny, he fancied himself as a bit
of a player, but really, he was all mouth.</i>

01:01.962 --> 01:03.429
<i>We called him O-Man</i>

01:03.430 --> 01:06.265
<i>because he had a birthmark on his
forehead that looked like a six.</i>

01:06.266 --> 01:08.246
<i>He loved it.</i>

01:08.535 --> 01:10.636
<i>Pete was the baby of the group.</i>

01:10.637 --> 01:14.084
<i>He wasn't the kind of kid we'd usually hang
out with, but he was good for a laugh.</i>

01:14.274 --> 01:17.016
<i>And he was absolutely minted.</i>

01:18.145 --> 01:22.815
<i>Steve was a pretty cool guy. We
jammed together, chased the girls.</i>

01:22.816 --> 01:26.085
<i>I think he saw us as rivals.
Sweet, really.</i>

01:26.086 --> 01:29.155
<i>And Andy.
Andy was my wingman.</i>

01:29.156 --> 01:32.000
<i>The one guy I could rely
on to back me up.</i>

01:32.159 --> 01:35.663
<i>He loved me, and I'm not being
funny, but I loved him, too.</i>

01:36.530 --> 01:39.265
<i>There was nothing we were
gonna miss about school.</i>

01:39.266 --> 01:40.336
<i>Maybe Mr. Shepherd.</i>

01:40.534 --> 01:42.070
<i>He was definitely
one of the good guys.</i>

01:42.235 --> 01:44.545
<i>He used to ask me what I
wanted to do with my life,</i>

01:44.838 --> 01:46.598
<i>I told him I just wanted
to have a good time.</i>

01:46.840 --> 01:49.709
<i>He thought that was funny.
It wasn't meant to be.</i>

01:49.710 --> 01:51.053
<i>Not that night.</i>

01:53.280 --> 01:57.057
<i>Newton Haven was our hometown.
Our playground, our universe.</i>

01:57.184 --> 02:00.028
<i>And that night it was the
site of a heroic quest.</i>

02:00.187 --> 02:03.100
<i>The aim? To conquer
The Golden Mile.</i>

02:03.256 --> 02:07.329
<i>Twelve pubs along a legendary
path of alcoholic Indulgence.</i>

02:07.494 --> 02:09.527
<i>There was The First Post,
The Old Familiar,</i>

02:09.529 --> 02:12.032
<i>The Famous Cock, The Cross
Hands, The Good Companions,</i>

02:12.132 --> 02:15.079
<i>The Trusty Servant, The Two Headed
Dog, The Mermaid, The Beehive,</i>

02:15.268 --> 02:16.836
<i>The King's Head,
The Hole in the Wall...</i>

02:16.837 --> 02:21.081
<i>All before reaching our
destiny, The World's End.</i>

02:21.241 --> 02:22.515
<i>We took my car into town.</i>

02:22.643 --> 02:25.715
<i>I called it The Beast
because she was pretty hairy.</i>

02:26.246 --> 02:28.881
<i>And so, our journey into manhood began.</i>

02:28.882 --> 02:31.453
<i>We were off.
We didn't waste any time.</i>

02:31.652 --> 02:33.757
<i>We hit pub one
and we hit it hard.</i>

02:34.187 --> 02:37.327
<i>There was drinking, there was
fun, there was controversy,</i>

02:37.491 --> 02:40.393
<i>there were ladies, there
were shots, there was drama,</i>

02:40.394 --> 02:43.307
<i>and of course,
there was drinking.</i>

02:45.232 --> 02:47.234
<i>By pub five,
we were feeling invincible</i>

02:47.367 --> 02:49.802
<i>and decided to purchase
some herbal refreshment</i>

02:49.803 --> 02:52.672
<i>from a man we called
The Reverend Green.</i>

02:52.673 --> 02:55.916
<i>Pint six put O-Man out of commission,
so we carried on without him.</i>

02:56.043 --> 02:58.711
<i>Good thing, I bumped into
his sister in the next pub,</i>

02:58.712 --> 03:01.454
<i>we went into the disableds
and I bumped into her again.</i>

03:01.682 --> 03:04.884
<i>Sam tagged along for a while,
but then I had to let her go.</i>

03:04.885 --> 03:08.594
<i>I had another date that night
and her name was Amber.</i>

03:09.489 --> 03:12.470
<i>Nine pints in and it was us
against the world.</i>

03:12.626 --> 03:14.093
<i>Things got mental
in The Beehive,</i>

03:14.094 --> 03:15.628
<i>so we repaired to
the bowls club</i>

03:15.629 --> 03:20.874
<i>or as we liked to call it, The Smokehouse,
which is when it all went fuck up.</i>

03:21.334 --> 03:24.303
<i>Everyone got para and Pete chucked
a whitey, so we had to bench him.</i>

03:24.304 --> 03:27.376
<i>In the end, we blew off the last
three pubs and headed for the hills.</i>

03:30.510 --> 03:32.011
<i>I remember sitting up there,</i>

03:32.012 --> 03:35.147
<i>blood on my knuckles, beer down
my shirt, sick on my shoes,</i>

03:35.148 --> 03:37.492
<i>seeing the orange glow
of a new dawn break</i>

03:37.651 --> 03:41.497
<i>and knowing in my heart, life
would never feel this good again.</i>

03:42.756 --> 03:43.956
<i>And you know what?</i>

03:45.592 --> 03:47.799
It never did.

03:49.996 --> 03:53.170
Thank you, Gary.
That was very enlightening.

03:54.000 --> 03:57.903
Would anyone like to add anything
or maybe challenge Gary?

03:57.904 --> 03:59.672
Are you disappointed?

03:59.673 --> 04:03.553
About what? That you didn't
make it to The World's End?

04:07.447 --> 04:08.585
No.

04:09.683 --> 04:12.051
<i>Just what is it
that you want to do?</i>

04:12.052 --> 04:14.053
<i>We want to be free!</i>

04:14.054 --> 04:17.123
<i>We want to be free to do
what we want to do!</i>

04:17.124 --> 04:19.524
<i>And we want to get loaded. And
we want to have a good time,</i>

04:19.526 --> 04:21.160
<i>And that's what
we're going to do.</i>

04:21.161 --> 04:22.795
<i>We're going to have
a good time.</i>

04:22.796 --> 04:23.917
<i>We're going to have a party.</i>

05:38.672 --> 05:40.709
<i>Just what is it
that you want to do?</i>

05:41.842 --> 05:45.051
<i>And we want to get loaded.
And we want to have a good time,</i>

05:48.615 --> 05:52.718
She's a beauty.
Yeah, but she's no Beast.

05:52.719 --> 05:54.553
Hello, Peter.

05:54.554 --> 05:56.591
Jesus! Gary?

05:56.890 --> 05:58.767
The once and future King.

05:58.925 --> 06:00.268
Were you outside my
house this morning?

06:00.427 --> 06:01.565
No.

06:01.695 --> 06:03.295
I could have sworn
I saw you on my street.

06:03.296 --> 06:05.231
I've never been
to Bishop's Gardens.

06:05.232 --> 06:06.532
How you doing, man?

06:06.533 --> 06:08.968
I'm well. You?
Yeah, never better.

06:08.969 --> 06:10.505
How is, uh...
Vanessa?

06:10.637 --> 06:12.071
No. Your wife?
Vanessa.

06:12.072 --> 06:14.273
Yeah. How's she?
She's good.

06:14.274 --> 06:16.642
Have you had sex yet?
We have two children.

06:16.643 --> 06:19.511
Ooh, twice. Get you, fuck machine.

06:19.512 --> 06:20.846
We haven't changed, have we?

06:20.847 --> 06:22.114
What is he doing here?

06:22.115 --> 06:24.149
It's all right, Dad.
We're fine.

06:24.150 --> 06:25.595
Hi, Mr. P.

06:26.786 --> 06:28.654
So, Gary, how can I help you?

06:28.655 --> 06:30.464
He looks well. Are you
looking to buy a car?

06:31.157 --> 06:34.798
Uh... No.
I'm afraid the end is nigh.

06:35.095 --> 06:37.563
What?
The World's End.

06:37.564 --> 06:38.664
What do you mean?

06:38.665 --> 06:42.401
You know what I mean. One night.
Five guys. Twelve pubs.

06:42.402 --> 06:43.710
Let battle commence.

06:43.837 --> 06:45.037
You want to try that again?

06:45.038 --> 06:46.672
Yeah, isn't that something
you've always wanted?

06:46.673 --> 06:48.908
Not particularly. No.
Look. Peter.

06:48.909 --> 06:53.112
We didn't make it before, but this time, we're
gonna see it through to the bitter end.

06:53.113 --> 06:54.246
Or lager end.

06:54.247 --> 06:55.915
We?
Yeah, the whole gang.

06:55.916 --> 06:58.556
Even Andy? Why wouldn't
Andy be coming?

06:58.685 --> 07:01.687
Well, I thought that after the accident...
Notan issue. He's in.

07:01.688 --> 07:04.023
What we wanna know is are you?

07:04.024 --> 07:05.765
I'd have to check with Vanessa.

07:06.026 --> 07:07.693
Who's Vanessa?
My wife.

07:07.694 --> 07:09.361
Since when have you had to
check with your wife?

07:09.362 --> 07:10.396
Since we got married.

07:10.397 --> 07:12.531
Oh, come on, man,
don't you miss it?

07:12.532 --> 07:16.201
The laughs, the
camaraderie, the fights,

07:16.202 --> 07:18.910
the hangovers so fierce it feels
like your head is full of ants.

07:19.039 --> 07:20.109
Maybe the first two.

07:20.273 --> 07:22.184
It begins.
What's your new number?

07:22.309 --> 07:23.686
Same one I've had for 10 years.

07:23.944 --> 07:24.945
Yeah. What's that one?

07:28.014 --> 07:32.451
This entire row here, they'll all have
dormer windows above the front elevation.

07:32.452 --> 07:34.453
Who's the helmet
without an helmet?

07:37.691 --> 07:39.864
That's Gary King.

07:42.562 --> 07:44.166
Knock, knock.

07:44.331 --> 07:46.038
What are you doing here, Gary?

07:46.166 --> 07:47.646
You're supposed to say,
"Who's there?"

07:47.767 --> 07:50.748
I can see who's there.
It's you.

07:50.870 --> 07:55.307
I like what you've done
with the place. Bit draughty.

07:55.308 --> 07:57.948
How's Selina?
We divorced 10 years ago.

07:58.078 --> 07:59.912
Yeah, I know, just
wondered how she was.

07:59.913 --> 08:02.448
She's doing very well,
apparently.

08:02.449 --> 08:03.849
Have you got anyone
else on the go?

08:03.850 --> 08:07.423
Yeah, I do, as it happens. She's a
fitness instructor. Twenty-six.

08:07.554 --> 08:10.228
Pedophile. I'm kidding.
I'd love to meet her sometime.

08:10.357 --> 08:11.924
No. Why are you here?

08:11.925 --> 08:15.532
Haven't you heard? We're getting
the band back together.

08:16.129 --> 08:17.763
I'm not your
bass player anymore.

08:17.764 --> 08:19.832
No, I mean we're getting
the boys back together.

08:19.833 --> 08:21.437
We can get the band back
together as well if you want.

08:21.568 --> 08:24.903
No, we can't. You sold
my guitar to buy drugs.

08:24.904 --> 08:28.240
I've always wondered, what's
that thing over the door called?

08:28.241 --> 08:29.242
That's a lintel.

08:29.376 --> 08:32.443
So, the plan is, we're going
to go back to Newton Haven,

08:32.445 --> 08:33.645
we are gonna do The Golden Mile

08:33.645 --> 08:36.615
and this time, we are gonna
make it to The World's End.

08:36.616 --> 08:37.950
Everybody's in.

08:37.951 --> 08:39.150
What, even Andy?

08:39.152 --> 08:40.753
Oh, you better
believe it, big balls.

08:40.754 --> 08:43.522
Andy is going drinking with you?
With us.

08:43.523 --> 08:47.027
Think about it, go back to the
old town, sink a few pints...

08:47.127 --> 08:48.765
Twelve pints.
Yeah.

08:48.962 --> 08:50.999
Twelve pints is insane.
I know!

08:52.565 --> 08:54.135
What is this all about, Gary?

08:54.434 --> 08:56.935
It's about closure, you know.

08:56.936 --> 09:00.105
Why should getting older affect
something as important as friendship?

09:00.106 --> 09:02.950
A let's changed since then, Oliver.
Right.

09:03.410 --> 09:05.811
This is our chance
to take stock.

09:05.812 --> 09:07.792
A stock take?
You make it sound so much fun.

09:08.048 --> 09:10.115
Come on, O-Man. Isn't that
something you'd like?

09:10.116 --> 09:12.584
What I'd really like is for you
to take your DMs off the sofa.

09:12.585 --> 09:15.687
Look. If you're worried about
me, don't be. All right?

09:15.688 --> 09:18.824
I'm here to tell you that Gary
King is back on the horse.

09:18.825 --> 09:21.727
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
You're back on the horse?

09:21.728 --> 09:22.763
No, I mean
I'm back on the bike.

09:22.896 --> 09:24.063
What is bike?
What do you mean?

09:24.064 --> 09:25.731
What is bike slang for?
Bicycle.

09:25.732 --> 09:26.832
I'm lost.
Don't be.

09:26.833 --> 09:28.067
Okay.
Listen.

09:28.068 --> 09:30.708
This is our chance to finally
finish what we started.

09:30.837 --> 09:33.477
Come on, man,
it'll be fucking mental!

09:34.641 --> 09:36.475
I think we're all done.
So...

09:36.476 --> 09:38.010
How do you like the property?

09:38.011 --> 09:40.012
Yeah. It's amazing.
Amazing location.

09:40.013 --> 09:41.747
Fantastic.
Fantastic aspects.

09:41.748 --> 09:44.583
It's just... It's just a little
bit out of our price range.

09:44.584 --> 09:46.518
He'll knock some off for you.
What's it down for?

09:46.519 --> 09:48.487
1.2 million.
Fuck off!

09:51.357 --> 09:53.158
You have my card.

09:53.159 --> 09:55.360
Gary, WTF?

09:55.361 --> 09:56.929
It's good to see you,
too, O-Man.

09:56.930 --> 09:58.564
Please don't call me O-Man.
Sure.

09:58.565 --> 10:00.466
Hey, how's your sister?
She's fine.

10:00.467 --> 10:01.667
She talk about me?
No.

10:01.668 --> 10:03.535
So, Friday, we'll all
go down together.

10:03.536 --> 10:04.913
Make a road trip of it,
I'll drive.

10:05.038 --> 10:07.518
Don't think I can. I think I've
got a doctor's appointment.

10:07.774 --> 10:09.219
Yeah, you do.
With Dr. Ink!

10:10.710 --> 10:13.350
You know, Dr. Ink?
Yeah. "Drink." I get it.

10:13.480 --> 10:16.315
Come on. It wouldn't be the
same without the O-Man.

10:16.316 --> 10:17.349
Jesus.

10:17.350 --> 10:21.320
You can see the guys, see how they're doing.
Tell them how you're doing.

10:21.321 --> 10:23.801
You never know, you might
make it to the end this time.

10:24.757 --> 10:27.067
And Andy's definitely coming?
Yeah.

10:28.128 --> 10:30.729
Andy Knightley?
Totes.

10:30.730 --> 10:32.869
And you convinced him how?

10:37.036 --> 10:39.073
Mr. Knightley.
Felicity.

10:39.205 --> 10:40.912
You have a friend
hereto see you.

10:43.676 --> 10:45.087
No, I don't.

10:47.013 --> 10:49.653
This is a bit grown up, isn't it?
Yup.

10:51.551 --> 10:54.086
Saw the boys the other day.
Mmm-hmm.

10:54.087 --> 10:57.227
O-Man, Stevie-Baby,
the Petertron.

10:58.124 --> 11:01.593
Yeah, I remember the names of
our childhood friends, Gary.

11:01.594 --> 11:04.763
We had ourselves a little idea.

11:04.764 --> 11:05.864
Did you now?

11:05.865 --> 11:07.435
Yeah. We're going to go
back to Newton Haven.

11:07.600 --> 11:11.742
Why? For some
unfinished business.

11:13.706 --> 11:15.117
That's a joke, right?

11:15.241 --> 11:19.077
Five guys. Twelve pubs. Fifty pints.
Sixty pints.

11:19.078 --> 11:20.955
Steady on, you fucking alky.

11:21.080 --> 11:23.315
I haven't had a drink
for 16 years, Gary.

11:23.316 --> 11:25.284
You must be thirsty then.

11:25.285 --> 11:28.587
We can go back, see the guys, chew the
fat, it'll be just like it always was,

11:28.588 --> 11:31.523
except this time we're going to
finish this thing once and for all.

11:31.524 --> 11:34.226
You have a very selective
memory, Gary. Thanks.

11:34.227 --> 11:35.961
You remember the Friday nights.

11:35.962 --> 11:37.162
I remember the Monday mornings.

11:37.163 --> 11:39.234
Yeah, that's why we're
going back on a Friday.

11:39.599 --> 11:42.205
Why do you think none of
us live in Newton Haven anymore?

11:42.335 --> 11:45.904
I don't know. Because it's a black hole.
It's boring.

11:45.905 --> 11:47.773
It always was
and it always will be.

11:47.774 --> 11:50.118
It's only boring
because we're not there.

11:50.276 --> 11:53.278
It's pointless arguing with you.
Exactly. So come.

11:53.279 --> 11:57.015
I'm picking everybody up from High
Wycombe station, Friday, 3:00 sharp.

11:57.016 --> 11:58.083
No, Gary.

11:58.084 --> 12:00.485
Oh, God, why? Have you got
to check with your missus?

12:00.486 --> 12:03.797
No, actually, I don't have
to check with my missus.

12:04.357 --> 12:07.270
What are you doing?
I'm showing you the door.

12:08.328 --> 12:10.562
Is it a door?
It doesn't have a lintel.

12:10.563 --> 12:13.765
And it's glass. So is it a
window or is it a dour?

12:13.766 --> 12:17.970
Maybe it's a windoor.
You can have that.

12:17.971 --> 12:19.279
Please leave, Gary.

12:22.108 --> 12:25.419
All right. All right.

12:27.480 --> 12:29.858
£600, wasn't it?

12:33.152 --> 12:36.793
Oh, urn, I thought you should know.
What?

12:37.690 --> 12:39.157
Mum died.

12:39.158 --> 12:41.195
When?
Couple of weeks ago.

12:42.395 --> 12:44.306
The big cancer.

12:46.266 --> 12:47.336
I'm sorry.

12:47.567 --> 12:50.013
She just always really
liked you, you know.

12:50.136 --> 12:52.504
Got me thinking
about the old days.

12:52.505 --> 12:54.883
Particularly that night, you
know, because we were so happy.

12:55.708 --> 12:59.678
And, you know, I love
the boys like brothers,

12:59.679 --> 13:03.718
but when all's said and done,
you're the best friend I ever had.

13:05.485 --> 13:07.692
It was good to see you, mate.

13:19.766 --> 13:21.033
Pete?

13:21.034 --> 13:22.868
Steven. Thank God.

13:22.869 --> 13:24.803
I had a horrible feeling I was
going to be the only one here.

13:24.804 --> 13:27.506
I reckon that's not the last horrible
feeling you're gonna have today, mate.

13:27.507 --> 13:28.707
This can't be happening.
Can it?

13:28.708 --> 13:30.642
You said it. What the
hell are we doing here?

13:30.643 --> 13:32.144
What we always did.

13:32.145 --> 13:34.880
Follow Gary King into
almost certain oblivion.

13:34.881 --> 13:36.148
Hello, Steven.

13:36.149 --> 13:37.349
You all right, mate?

13:37.350 --> 13:38.795
Pete. Hi, mate.

13:38.918 --> 13:42.254
Didn't we decide to stop calling him
Fearless Leader somewhere around 1992?

13:42.255 --> 13:43.522
Old habits die hard.

13:43.523 --> 13:45.090
They'll be putting that
on Gary's tombstone.

13:45.091 --> 13:46.825
No, they won't.
You know he'll outlive us all.

13:46.826 --> 13:48.560
That's! be funny
if it wasn't true.

13:48.561 --> 13:50.529
Hang on a sec.
What?

13:50.530 --> 13:53.732
I'm just trying to decide which of
us is the biggest idiot for coming.

14:00.773 --> 14:03.442
Maybe he had an accident.
Oh, sorry, Andy.

14:03.443 --> 14:05.844
Sorry. No, no, no. It's fine.

14:05.845 --> 14:07.112
I think Gary having an accident

14:07.113 --> 14:09.787
would actually be the best outcome
for all of us, including Gary.

14:13.152 --> 14:14.597
Unbelievable.

14:19.425 --> 14:20.495
Oh, yes.

14:20.927 --> 14:22.594
Look at these cunts.

14:22.595 --> 14:24.129
You're late.
No, I'm not.

14:24.130 --> 14:26.633
Yeah, you are. You said 3:00.
It's almost 4:00.

14:26.799 --> 14:28.200
Yeah, 3 for 4.

14:28.201 --> 14:30.135
You know your problem, Gary?
You're never wrong.

14:30.136 --> 14:31.236
How is that a problem?

14:31.237 --> 14:33.171
I can't believe you bought
another Granada Mark II.

14:33.172 --> 14:34.239
What do you mean?

14:34.240 --> 14:36.875
This looks exactly like
the car I sold you in 1989.

14:36.876 --> 14:39.878
This is the car you sold me in 1989.
Best 300 quid I ever spent.

14:39.879 --> 14:41.290
This is The Beast?
Yeah.

14:41.814 --> 14:43.849
Pretty much. I mean, she's
had a bit of work done.

14:43.850 --> 14:47.052
I had to replace the brakes,
suspension, exhaust, seats, wheels,

14:47.053 --> 14:50.455
paneling, carburetor, manifold, the whole
engine, really, mirrors, headlamps.

14:50.456 --> 14:52.991
Other than that,
she's the same old motor.

14:52.992 --> 14:54.335
You could almost
say an antique.

14:54.494 --> 14:58.636
Well, then let's get this
antique on the roadshow.

15:04.237 --> 15:06.217
Come on, you bellends.
We're going to be late.

15:06.706 --> 15:09.619
And we're back.
Just like the Five Musketeers.

15:09.809 --> 15:11.311
Three Musketeers, isn't it?

15:11.411 --> 15:12.878
Four if you count D'Artagnan,

15:12.879 --> 15:14.880
Well, nobody knows how many there
were, really, do they, Pete?

15:14.881 --> 15:16.214
I mean, history's a sketchbook.

15:16.215 --> 15:19.251
You do know that <i>The Three
Musketeers</i> is a fiction, right?

15:19.252 --> 15:20.352
Written by Alexandre Dumas?

15:20.353 --> 15:22.162
A lot of people are saying that
about the Bible these days.

15:22.288 --> 15:24.289
What, that it was written by
Alexandre Dumas?

15:24.290 --> 15:26.497
Don't be daft, Steve,
it was written by Jesus.

15:26.692 --> 15:28.593
Oh. Anyway, five
sounds much better.

15:28.594 --> 15:30.028
I think they missed a trick
only having three.

15:30.029 --> 15:32.998
'Cause you'd have five, then two could've
died and they'd still have three left.

15:32.999 --> 15:34.910
Are we there yet?
Let's do this!

15:50.049 --> 15:52.962
Soup Dragons!
I remember this one.

15:54.120 --> 15:55.720
I put this on a tape
for you, didn't I?

15:55.721 --> 15:56.888
Yeah, this is it.

15:56.889 --> 15:59.961
This is the tape?
Yeah, yeah! Look, look.

16:00.193 --> 16:03.663
Where did you find it?
It was in the tape player.

16:06.866 --> 16:09.401
Oh, look. Is anyone hungry?

16:10.670 --> 16:12.707
I need a piss actually.

16:19.679 --> 16:20.919
This is a long piss.

16:21.614 --> 16:23.715
If it is a piss.

16:23.716 --> 16:26.284
Might be a little...
Poo.

16:26.285 --> 16:27.730
How is that a poo?

16:27.854 --> 16:31.556
Still work for your old man, Pete?
Yeah. I'm a partner now.

16:31.557 --> 16:32.624
You?

16:32.625 --> 16:36.728
Yeah, started my own firm in '98.
Got bought out in '05.

16:36.729 --> 16:38.470
I'm happier, though.
It's less stress.

16:38.598 --> 16:40.131
Ollie?
Property.

16:40.132 --> 16:43.668
I co-manage a boutique estate
agency in North London.

16:43.669 --> 16:44.903
Very competitive.

16:44.904 --> 16:47.839
Is it family law you're in, Andy?
Corporate.

16:47.840 --> 16:49.107
Does anyone know
what Gary's doing?

16:49.108 --> 16:51.009
He's playing <i>Need For Speed.</i>
Over there.

16:51.010 --> 16:53.345
Come on, come on, come on!

16:53.346 --> 16:54.386
He hasn't changed, has he?

16:55.281 --> 16:59.320
I don't know. He did finally
pay me back that £600.

16:59.585 --> 17:02.589
Really? He borrowed £200 off me.
And me.

17:04.190 --> 17:07.364
I can't believe it.
I can't believe you'd do that!

17:08.694 --> 17:09.832
Oh! Of course I can.

17:09.962 --> 17:11.839
It's just robbing
Peter to pay Paul.

17:12.131 --> 17:15.601
No, I borrowed it from Peter to pay you.
I still owe Paul.

17:21.107 --> 17:23.974
Oh, shit.

17:23.976 --> 17:25.683
Newton Haven.

17:26.444 --> 17:31.750
Take a moment to look upon it in its original
colors, boys, for tonight we paint it red.

17:36.956 --> 17:40.335
Oh, no, no, no. Shit.

17:42.828 --> 17:45.363
Fuck, fuck, fuck.

17:45.364 --> 17:46.665
Fuck, fuck.

17:46.666 --> 17:48.800
Oh, no, it's okay,
I did it all in the services.

17:52.838 --> 17:54.476
Know why I pulled
you over, sir?

17:55.641 --> 17:57.143
Was the music too loud?

17:57.276 --> 18:00.723
Your left brake light is faulty.
Oh!

18:00.880 --> 18:04.649
The old brake lights! So called
because they're always breaking.

18:04.650 --> 18:05.993
I'll get that sorted out,
Officer.

18:06.686 --> 18:09.292
Can I see your license, sir?
Yup.

18:10.523 --> 18:11.690
Ah!

18:11.691 --> 18:13.158
You know what?
It's in my wallet.

18:13.159 --> 18:15.994
And I left that
at the bloody gym!

18:15.995 --> 18:20.632
Any other form of identification?
No, it's all in my sports bag.

18:20.633 --> 18:23.201
That's bloody typical,
isn't it? Um...

18:23.202 --> 18:26.304
I'll give you my name and address, you
can run me through the old system.

18:26.305 --> 18:27.340
Go on then.

18:27.440 --> 18:29.474
It's Peter Page.

18:29.475 --> 18:34.356
48 Bishop's Gardens,
London, N2 T12.

18:37.083 --> 18:40.118
Jesus, Gary! WTF? Why did
you give him my name?

18:40.119 --> 18:41.621
I'm not gonna give
him my name, am I?

18:41.721 --> 18:43.088
Suppose I get done
by the police?

18:43.089 --> 18:44.432
You won't get done
by the police.

18:44.557 --> 18:46.434
Gary, he will check the number
plate against his name!

18:46.559 --> 18:48.193
I know. Why do you think
I gave him Pete's name?

18:48.194 --> 18:51.096
Jesus Christ, Gary, I own a car showroom.
I am a junior partner.

18:51.097 --> 18:52.597
This is...

18:52.598 --> 18:53.702
Just trust me.

18:55.234 --> 18:58.036
So, Mr. Page, what brings
you to Newton Haven?

18:58.037 --> 19:01.006
Well, we're all from here. We're
just back to see the sights.

19:01.007 --> 19:03.008
Have a crack at
the old Golden Mile.

19:03.009 --> 19:04.376
Might get a bit messy.

19:04.377 --> 19:06.544
Well, you make sure you get
that brake light fixed

19:06.545 --> 19:09.151
and you might want to do
an emissions test, too.

19:09.882 --> 19:11.149
Oh, and, Peter.

19:11.150 --> 19:12.390
Don't make too much mess.

19:14.587 --> 19:15.725
We won't!

19:15.988 --> 19:17.023
Hmm.

19:17.123 --> 19:18.289
I don't understand.

19:18.290 --> 19:20.225
It's simple, Pete.

19:20.226 --> 19:23.228
The car's still registered to
you, it has been since 1989.

19:23.229 --> 19:24.663
But I've moved
three times since then.

19:24.664 --> 19:26.231
I know, I changed the log book.

19:26.232 --> 19:28.033
Where do you think
all those points came from?

19:28.034 --> 19:29.240
Jesus. You guys need to relax.

19:45.851 --> 19:47.786
Do you know how much
trouble you could get into?

19:47.787 --> 19:49.454
Do you know how much
trouble I'm already in?

19:49.455 --> 19:50.689
What's that supposed to mean?

19:50.690 --> 19:54.025
Hey. What the hell is this?
Why are we even here?

19:54.026 --> 19:56.628
We are here to get annihilated.

19:57.930 --> 19:59.931
Have you got any plans
for dinner at all?

19:59.932 --> 20:02.867
Tonight, we will be partaking
of a liquid repast

20:02.868 --> 20:05.236
as we wend our way
up The Golden Mile.

20:05.237 --> 20:08.006
Commencing with an inaugural
tankard at The First Post,

20:08.007 --> 20:11.176
then onto The Old Familiar, The
Famous Cock, The Cross Hands,

20:11.177 --> 20:12.644
The Good Companions,
The Trusty Servant,

20:12.645 --> 20:14.879
The Two Headed Dog, The Mermaid,
The Beehive, The King's Head

20:14.880 --> 20:16.915
and The Hole in the Wall
for a measure of the same.

20:16.916 --> 20:20.785
All before the last bittersweet
pint in that most fateful terminus,

20:20.786 --> 20:22.053
The World's End.

20:22.054 --> 20:23.121
Leave a light on, good lady,

20:23.122 --> 20:25.523
for though we may return
with a twinkle in our eyes,

20:25.524 --> 20:27.731
we will, in truth,
be blind drunk.

21:49.875 --> 21:50.876
Come on!

21:57.049 --> 21:58.850
Until 1840...
Fucking hell.

21:58.851 --> 22:01.953
...this building was the site of
Newton Haven's first post office.

22:01.954 --> 22:03.988
Until an enterprising
business fellow decided that

22:03.989 --> 22:07.025
far from befitting the sending
and receiving of mail

22:07.026 --> 22:09.227
it was perhaps better
suited as a humble taproom

22:09.228 --> 22:13.005
where a weary traveler might get Matted.
Come on.

22:14.834 --> 22:17.135
Ah!

22:17.136 --> 22:18.774
It's like déjà vu.

22:24.910 --> 22:27.078
I don't remember this at all.
Has it been refurbished?

22:27.079 --> 22:29.047
Been bought by a chain,
hasn't it?

22:29.048 --> 22:30.715
Part of that nationwide
initiative to rob

22:30.716 --> 22:33.629
small, charming pubs
of any discernible character.

22:33.752 --> 22:36.198
Starbucking, man.
It's happening everywhere.

22:37.690 --> 22:39.290
Can't take away
that smell, though.

22:39.291 --> 22:40.959
I'm sure they tried.

22:40.960 --> 22:44.863
Good evening, Raymondo. The
prodigal sons return. Eh?

22:44.864 --> 22:46.464
Who's on the
guest list tonight?

22:46.465 --> 22:48.433
Come again?
The guest ales.

22:48.434 --> 22:51.269
We, sir, are doing The
Golden Mile and you have

22:51.270 --> 22:53.443
the honor of drawing
first blood.

22:53.606 --> 22:56.177
What do you recommend? There's one.
Crowning Glory.

22:57.209 --> 22:58.711
Rather fitting.
How's that?

22:58.811 --> 23:00.612
I'm Gary King.
What?

23:00.613 --> 23:02.914
So tell me more.
About what?

23:02.915 --> 23:05.250
Crowning Glory. Is it nutty?
Is it foamy? Is it happy?

23:05.251 --> 23:07.986
Does it have a surprisingly fruity
note which lingers on the tongue?

23:07.987 --> 23:10.321
Hmm. It's beer.
Hmm.

23:10.322 --> 23:11.723
We'll have five
of those, please.

23:11.724 --> 23:14.728
No. Sorry. Can we have four of
those and a tap water, please?

23:15.194 --> 23:16.400
What?

23:25.371 --> 23:27.405
I don't believe this,

23:27.406 --> 23:32.082
a man of your legendary prowess
drinking fucking rain.

23:32.878 --> 23:34.879
It's like seeing a lion
eating some hummus.

23:34.880 --> 23:37.048
That doesn't make any sense. I
know it doesn't make any sense.

23:37.049 --> 23:39.684
You seriously have a problem with me
not drinking, after what happened?

23:39.685 --> 23:42.320
I don't, but King Arthur does!
Oh, this'll be good.

23:42.321 --> 23:43.823
What's King Arthur
got to do with it?

23:43.923 --> 23:47.234
Do you honestly think that King Arthur
came back from the Battle of Hastings,

23:47.393 --> 23:50.795
fucking rocked up at Arthur's Castle...
Camelot.

23:50.796 --> 23:52.063
...walked up to the bar
and went,

23:52.064 --> 23:53.998
"Hello.
Could I have a tap water?"

23:53.999 --> 23:56.502
No, because they didn't have
running water in Arthurian times.

23:56.835 --> 24:00.505
Exactly. He would have had a mead.
The King Arthur of beers.

24:00.506 --> 24:02.679
And I'm less of a man because
I choose to drink water?

24:02.908 --> 24:04.375
Well, it's a bit
"ooh ducky", innit?

24:04.376 --> 24:05.743
That's not very PC, Gary.

24:05.744 --> 24:07.645
Get out of the '90s, Pete.

24:07.646 --> 24:10.648
There's nothing "ooh ducky"
about being teetotal,

24:10.649 --> 24:13.184
about walking into a pub
after a rugby match

24:13.185 --> 24:17.655
and ordering a tap water at a bar packed
full of big ugly bastards wearing warpaint.

24:17.656 --> 24:20.892
That, my friend, takes confidence, yeah?
I'm talking balls.

24:20.893 --> 24:22.566
You said it, poof.

24:23.195 --> 24:27.234
I don't know if you're aware of this,
Gary, but we are not teenagers anymore.

24:27.366 --> 24:29.867
And God forbid you ever have
children, because if...

24:29.868 --> 24:31.035
I might have kids.

24:31.036 --> 24:32.538
Then you had better be ready
to take responsibility...

24:32.638 --> 24:34.242
No. I mean I might have kids.

24:34.873 --> 24:37.786
You remember Karen
Eggerton, who I fucked?

24:38.210 --> 24:40.713
She was two weeks late when her
parents emigrated to Normandy.

24:40.879 --> 24:44.554
I never heard from her again.
She might have had a baby.

24:44.750 --> 24:47.230
Imagine that? A French kid.

24:47.386 --> 24:48.990
It's pointless arguing
with you.

24:49.254 --> 24:51.461
To kids.
Wherever they may be.

24:52.391 --> 24:53.392
Kids.
Kids.

24:56.362 --> 24:57.966
Drink up. Let's Boo-Boo.

24:58.397 --> 24:59.630
"Boo-Boo".
What is that?

24:59.631 --> 25:01.966
You remember,
"Let's Boo-Boo."

25:01.967 --> 25:04.068
You know, from Mr. Shepherd's
classroom, it said on the wall,

25:04.069 --> 25:06.671
"Exit, pursued by a bear," you
know, from that Shakespeare play?

25:06.672 --> 25:08.506
<i>A Winter's Tale.</i>
Yeah. What was it called?

25:08.507 --> 25:09.841
<i>A Winter's Tale.</i>
That's it.

25:09.842 --> 25:12.944
And if we needed to make a quick getaway,
we'd say, "Exit, pursued by a bear,"

25:12.945 --> 25:14.947
and then it was,
"Exit, pursued by Yogi Bear,"

25:15.047 --> 25:16.881
and then it was just,
"Let's Yogi and Boo-Boo,"

25:16.882 --> 25:18.156
and then, "Let's Boo-Boo."

25:18.283 --> 25:20.603
So you're saying we should go?
Yeah. it's shit here, innit?

25:25.591 --> 25:26.592
Ah!

25:27.359 --> 25:32.604
The Old Familiar.
Now this is a pub.

25:35.267 --> 25:37.838
Yes.
This is more like it.

25:40.906 --> 25:42.078
Like déjà vu.

25:42.775 --> 25:48.613
David, my man, have you heard the news?
Gary King is back in town.

25:48.614 --> 25:49.649
Who's he?

26:05.330 --> 26:06.673
How was the funeral, Gary?

26:09.168 --> 26:10.306
Your mum's funeral?

26:11.403 --> 26:13.474
It's difficult to
put into words.

26:14.373 --> 26:18.287
But if I had to choose
three, I would say,

26:18.877 --> 26:21.687
"Really, really sad."

26:22.815 --> 26:24.385
Oh, no, that's two, isn't it?

26:24.516 --> 26:27.292
How about, "Really, very sad"?

26:28.287 --> 26:31.530
It's a shame,
she was a good woman.

26:32.391 --> 26:34.025
I really liked your mum.

26:34.026 --> 26:36.973
Me, too, mate. Me, too.

26:37.796 --> 26:39.730
Hello.
Hello, mate.

26:39.731 --> 26:40.832
Are you here?

26:40.833 --> 26:42.835
Yeah, I've been here for ages.
What are you talking about?

26:42.935 --> 26:44.846
You get lost on the
ring road again?

26:45.771 --> 26:47.505
This is Newton Haven.

26:47.506 --> 26:49.315
What time are you meeting The Twins?
Twins?

26:49.441 --> 26:52.047
We're all at The Old Familiar.
Come by if you want.

26:53.879 --> 26:57.656
Yeah, he is. Okay.
See you soon.

26:58.050 --> 26:59.188
Who was that, O-Man?

26:59.318 --> 27:03.855
Don't call me O-Man, Gary.
If you must know it was Sam.

27:03.856 --> 27:04.889
Sam's here?
Sam's here?

27:04.890 --> 27:07.892
Is there a fucking echo in here?
Yes, Sam's here.

27:07.893 --> 27:10.194
She's down from Manchester. We're
driving to Mum's tomorrow.

27:10.195 --> 27:11.429
What, and she's coming here?

27:11.430 --> 27:13.865
Calm down, Steve, I saw her first.
Jesus Christ, not this again.

27:13.866 --> 27:17.735
Are you fucking kidding me?
I saw her first.

27:17.736 --> 27:20.114
You really have a selective
memory, don't you?

27:20.239 --> 27:21.706
Somebody else was saying that.

27:21.707 --> 27:23.574
Me. No. I would have remembered.

27:23.575 --> 27:25.510
I told you I had
a thing about Sam

27:25.511 --> 27:28.079
and you proceeded to try and get
in her pants at every opportunity.

27:28.080 --> 27:29.147
Guys, please.

27:29.148 --> 27:31.482
You only liked her after
you found out I liked her!

27:31.483 --> 27:33.351
That's right, because you
did the school play.

27:33.352 --> 27:35.386
Cabaret. Cabaret.
Because she was in it.

27:35.387 --> 27:38.322
And she wore those fishnet stockings
and you got a big boner on stage.

27:38.323 --> 27:39.490
Jesus Christ.

27:39.491 --> 27:42.593
Doesn't matter anyway, she always had
a massive wide on for Adrian Keane.

27:42.594 --> 27:43.828
I hated that prick.

27:43.829 --> 27:48.437
Can we not talk about
my sister in relation to,

27:48.567 --> 27:51.769
A, massive wide ons,
B, Steven's erect penis?

27:51.770 --> 27:53.271
All right.

27:53.272 --> 27:55.252
Is she still fit, though?
I'm not answering that.

27:56.008 --> 27:57.074
Is she, though?

27:57.075 --> 27:59.578
Am I what?
Fit.

28:00.279 --> 28:03.814
Hello, Sam. Steven? You've
grown, haven't you?

28:03.815 --> 28:05.850
Yeah, sideways.
You look fantastic.

28:05.851 --> 28:07.318
Steroids.

28:07.319 --> 28:10.188
Andy, longtime.

28:10.189 --> 28:11.822
Hi, Pete.
Hi, Sam.

28:11.823 --> 28:12.824
All right, big brother?

28:14.393 --> 28:15.526
Gary.

28:15.527 --> 28:18.963
<i>Willkommen. Bienvenue.</i>
Welcome.

28:18.964 --> 28:20.124
Sam. Would you like a drink?

28:20.265 --> 28:23.067
Hey, Steve. She's just got here.
Come on.

28:23.068 --> 28:24.268
Sam. Would you like a drink?

28:24.269 --> 28:26.504
I'll have a vodka tonic,
thanks, Steven. Sure.

28:26.505 --> 28:28.025
I'm just going to nip to the loo.
Cool.

28:29.641 --> 28:31.120
Nature calls.

28:38.016 --> 28:39.850
What are you doing?
What are you doing?

28:39.851 --> 28:41.831
I'm going to the toilet.
Well, then, so am I.

28:43.789 --> 28:45.523
Gary! You are
out of your mind!

28:45.524 --> 28:46.969
What are you talking about?
You gave me the sign.

28:47.125 --> 28:49.799
What sign?
You went to the toilet.

28:49.928 --> 28:51.829
Gary, are you serious? I
haven't seen you in 20 years.

28:51.830 --> 28:54.432
Do you really think I'm going to have
sex with you in the ladies' toilet?

28:54.433 --> 28:56.167
Well, the disableds
is out of order.

28:56.168 --> 28:58.202
Gary. What happened?
I don't know,

28:58.203 --> 29:00.471
maybe one of them put too many
paper towels down the toilet.

29:00.472 --> 29:02.872
I mean, we don't know what they
are thinking, really, do we?

29:02.975 --> 29:05.009
No. What happened to you?

29:05.010 --> 29:06.148
Nothing.

29:07.145 --> 29:09.056
Nothing happened to me.
I'm the same old Gary.

29:09.281 --> 29:11.158
No shit.
Huh!

29:11.416 --> 29:12.554
So, do you wanna?

29:14.486 --> 29:16.954
Oliver. I'll see you later.
You're going?

29:16.955 --> 29:19.156
I thought you weren't meeting The
Twins for another half hour?

29:19.157 --> 29:22.036
I'm not. Oh, yeah.
I believe this is yours.

29:26.465 --> 29:30.709
"Out of order."
It's a private joke.

29:31.403 --> 29:32.882
I don't want to know.

29:47.853 --> 29:49.854
- What is that?
- Modern art.

29:49.855 --> 29:50.955
It's a memorial, isn't it?

29:50.956 --> 29:52.299
Yeah. To modern art.

29:53.158 --> 29:54.678
Hey. guys, do you
know what time it is?

29:55.327 --> 29:56.594
It's not even 6:00.

29:56.595 --> 30:00.564
Wrong! it's high time
we got onto The Cock!

30:00.565 --> 30:01.600
Whoo-hoo!

30:03.335 --> 30:04.313
Let's go.

30:05.304 --> 30:06.908
Come on.

30:16.248 --> 30:17.727
When you're ready, mate.

30:20.919 --> 30:23.024
Oh, shit.
Look who it is.

30:23.655 --> 30:25.225
Basil. Mad Basil!

30:25.624 --> 30:26.791
Do you remember?
We used to come in here

30:26.792 --> 30:31.502
and listen to him talk about fucking UFOs
and lizard people and underwater Nazis.

30:31.630 --> 30:33.473
Didn't he spout some
bullshit about the Bermuda Triangle

30:33.598 --> 30:34.665
actually being a square?

30:34.666 --> 30:37.868
No, he said it was two isosceles
triangles forming a rhombus.

30:37.869 --> 30:39.170
He was your best mate,
wasn't he, Steve?

30:39.171 --> 30:41.706
No, he wasn't my
best mate, Gary.

30:41.707 --> 30:43.908
He was a lonely, old guy and
I felt a bit sorry for him.

30:43.909 --> 30:45.752
That's right. Basil!

30:48.046 --> 30:50.081
Maybe we're not the local
legends you think we are.

30:50.082 --> 30:51.749
Gary King?
Speak for yourself, mate.

30:51.750 --> 30:53.161
You're barred.

30:55.120 --> 30:58.589
I cannot fucking believe this.
This is ridiculous.

30:58.590 --> 30:59.757
Believe me, Gary,
it's not worth it.

30:59.758 --> 31:02.432
Have two in the next one. Have them
all in the next one, for all I care.

31:02.561 --> 31:05.322
We've got to have one in every pub
otherwise the whole thing's fucked.

31:05.430 --> 31:07.273
I'd say it was fairly
fucked already, mate.

31:07.566 --> 31:08.544
Great.

31:16.441 --> 31:18.542
How much more of this
do we have to endure?

31:18.543 --> 31:20.545
That was three. There's nine more.
Oh, good.

31:20.645 --> 31:22.613
Fuck that.
I need to eat something.

31:22.614 --> 31:23.948
We can get some food
in the next pub.

31:23.949 --> 31:25.983
As long as it's
reasonably healthy.

31:25.984 --> 31:27.486
This is Newton Haven.

31:27.686 --> 31:29.653
Hardly the heart of the
organic revolution.

31:29.654 --> 31:31.355
I doubt it's the
heart of anything.

31:31.356 --> 31:35.226
My wife wanted us to go organic,
problem is, I kinda like eating shit.

31:35.227 --> 31:37.173
The next pub does shit!
Keep up!

31:40.799 --> 31:43.734
Oh, yeah.
I remember this one.

31:43.735 --> 31:45.908
- We had New Year's in here, didn't we?
- '89 into '90.

31:46.037 --> 31:48.038
Isn't that when you
slept on the pool table, Andy?

31:48.039 --> 31:49.109
Yeah. I believe it was.

31:49.274 --> 31:50.617
For six hours.
Six hours.

31:51.810 --> 31:53.310
Thank you for reminding me.

31:56.248 --> 31:57.348
Do you remember
when you woke up,

31:57.349 --> 31:59.717
we said you'd been asleep for
a year and that it was 1991

31:59.718 --> 32:01.279
and you freaked out
and punched a clock?

32:02.354 --> 32:03.560
That was a great night.

32:03.789 --> 32:05.632
Didn't you manage to get off
with Erika Leekes, Peter?

32:05.824 --> 32:08.600
Yes, I did. Something of a personal
triumph, if I say so myself.

32:08.727 --> 32:11.629
She of the Marmalade Sandwich fame?
Marmalade Sandwich...

32:11.630 --> 32:12.631
The very same.

32:12.764 --> 32:15.633
Erika Leekes, Tracy Benson,
Becky Salt.

32:15.634 --> 32:17.568
Two blondes and a redhead
in the middle.

32:17.569 --> 32:20.604
The Marmalade Sandwich.
Becky Salt. Fucking hell.

32:20.605 --> 32:21.839
Wonder what they're doing now.

32:21.840 --> 32:23.040
Why don't you ask them?

32:23.041 --> 32:24.076
What do you mean?

32:24.176 --> 32:27.745
I mean, sitting at that table over there are
two blondes and a redhead in the middle.

32:27.746 --> 32:29.113
Shut the fuck up.

32:29.114 --> 32:31.449
I'd say that's Erika Leekes on the
left, Tracy Benson on the right,

32:31.450 --> 32:33.517
and by process of elimination,
there's Becky Salt in the middle.

32:33.518 --> 32:35.453
That's the Marmalade Sandwich
all growed up.

32:35.454 --> 32:37.188
That is very spooky.

32:37.189 --> 32:38.889
We should get them over.
No.

32:38.890 --> 32:40.424
Leave the past where it is.

32:40.425 --> 32:42.092
It's bad enough having to
look at your old, ugly mugs.

32:42.093 --> 32:44.562
You make it sound like
we're fucking ancient.

32:44.563 --> 32:45.596
We haven't changed that much.

32:45.597 --> 32:47.832
I mean, sure, Steve's let
himself go a bit. What?

32:47.833 --> 32:50.601
Pete's got the same haircut and Oliver
has still got his mark of the devil.

32:50.602 --> 32:51.869
No, he hasn't No, he hasn't.

32:51.870 --> 32:53.103
It's called
laser surgery, Gary.

32:53.104 --> 32:55.673
It's a small price to pay for
not being called fucking O-Man.

32:55.674 --> 32:57.374
That works for Sisters of
Mercy tattoos as well.

32:57.375 --> 32:58.752
I still like the
Sisters Of Mercy.

32:58.877 --> 33:00.151
Well, good job,
or you'd never go swimming.

33:00.278 --> 33:01.545
I'm lost.
Don't be.

33:01.546 --> 33:04.288
Well, I for one, think it's nice
to see the old faces again.

33:04.416 --> 33:05.451
Cheers, mate.

33:05.650 --> 33:07.095
Excuse me? This taken?

33:09.254 --> 33:10.460
Is this seat taken?

33:12.157 --> 33:13.227
Have it, mate.

33:13.625 --> 33:14.660
Thanks.

33:17.562 --> 33:20.197
Wasn't that...
Shane Hawkins.

33:20.198 --> 33:22.032
Hey, didn't he...
Yes, he did.

33:22.033 --> 33:24.268
Hang on. What happened
with Shane Hawkins again?

33:24.269 --> 33:26.681
I'd rather not bring it all
up again, if that's okay.

33:27.772 --> 33:29.440
Hey, man. Listen, Pete.

33:29.441 --> 33:31.208
Bottling up past trauma
can lead to

33:31.209 --> 33:34.512
inadequate coping strategies
in later life, apparently.

33:34.513 --> 33:36.947
I don't know, I mean, it's not
even about the past, you know.

33:36.948 --> 33:40.150
It's not about the fact
that he bullied me,

33:40.151 --> 33:42.597
that he made me miss more
school days than chicken pox.

33:42.754 --> 33:46.224
It's not even that he forced me to spend
entire lessons hiding in a toilet cubicle,

33:46.391 --> 33:49.600
or that he punched me so hard
he dislodged my eyeball.

33:49.761 --> 33:52.742
And it's not even that he ruined
a large portion of my childhood.

33:52.864 --> 33:57.108
No, it's the fact that just
then, he didn't recognize me.

33:57.369 --> 34:01.340
He looked straight through me
like it all meant nothing.

34:02.274 --> 34:04.608
That probably sounds weird,
doesn't it?

34:04.609 --> 34:06.110
Shots!

34:06.111 --> 34:09.284
S-H-O-T-S. Shots.

34:09.414 --> 34:10.620
What are you doing, Gary?

34:10.849 --> 34:12.829
I thought it was obvious.
Shots.

34:12.951 --> 34:14.552
Firstly, Peter was talking
about something

34:14.553 --> 34:15.985
which clearly made him
feel very uncomfortable.

34:15.987 --> 34:18.159
It's all right, Andy.
No, Peter, it's not all right.

34:18.489 --> 34:23.199
Secondly, 12 pints is more than enough,
and thirdly, I don't fucking drink!

34:23.360 --> 34:25.396
But shots don't count, do they?

34:25.397 --> 34:27.164
You said you wanted
to catch up and chew the fat.

34:27.165 --> 34:29.007
I think you just
wanted to drink it.

34:29.199 --> 34:30.568
We're not here as your friends.

34:30.569 --> 34:32.242
We're just your
fucking enablers.

34:32.637 --> 34:34.905
Enablers. That's a funny word, isn't it?
"Enabler."

34:34.906 --> 34:36.639
Gary King And The Enablers.

34:36.641 --> 34:38.309
That's a good name for a band, Steve.
Write that down.

34:38.310 --> 34:39.550
Don't do a Gary, Gary.

34:39.678 --> 34:41.679
Oh, is that a thing now, is it?
It's always been a thing.

34:41.679 --> 34:43.414
You don't need us to
help you get fucked up,

34:43.415 --> 34:46.190
you've done a perfectly
good job so far on your own.

34:47.319 --> 34:49.320
I'm gonna go and see if
there's a bus back to London

34:49.321 --> 34:50.654
if anyone wants to
come with me.

34:50.655 --> 34:54.525
You can't go. This is special.
This is our anniversary.

34:54.525 --> 34:55.926
It's not the anniversary, Gary.

34:55.927 --> 34:57.561
We did this in June.
It's October.

34:57.562 --> 34:59.363
Yeah, but it's the anniversary
of the year, isn't it?

34:59.364 --> 35:01.265
Every year is the
anniversary of a year!

35:01.266 --> 35:03.007
It's just not the
same anymore, Gary,

35:03.134 --> 35:05.512
and it's not that the town's
changed, we have changed.

35:05.704 --> 35:08.412
Yeah, well, you can't go,
'cause the buses are finished.

35:09.040 --> 35:11.442
Then I'm gonna go back to the B&B.
You coming?

35:11.443 --> 35:12.610
I could do with
an early one actually.

35:12.611 --> 35:14.011
I should probably go
and find Sam.

35:14.012 --> 35:15.732
Yeah, I'm gonna go
and find Sam with Oliver.

35:15.880 --> 35:17.086
That's settled then, yeah?

35:18.550 --> 35:21.190
You know what I think?
I think you're jealous.

35:21.386 --> 35:26.358
Yeah, you've got your houses and your cars
and your wives and your job security.

35:26.524 --> 35:29.630
But you don't have
what I have. Freedom.

35:29.828 --> 35:34.038
You're all slaves and I'm free
to do what I want any old time.

35:34.566 --> 35:35.977
And this is what you want?

35:36.868 --> 35:39.542
You should grow up, mate.
Join society.

35:39.838 --> 35:42.079
Yeah, but Mum died.

35:42.207 --> 35:45.586
And we're all very sorry,
but now it's time to go home.

35:48.747 --> 35:50.590
I thought we were home.

35:56.588 --> 35:59.535
I can't help feeling sorry for him.

36:07.966 --> 36:09.274
Don't.

36:18.610 --> 36:20.817
Oh! Fuck! Piss!

36:30.255 --> 36:33.236
Careful, the floors
a bit pissy.

36:34.392 --> 36:35.894
Wasn't me.

36:39.397 --> 36:41.274
That was me.

36:42.434 --> 36:44.175
Did that back in '90.

36:45.804 --> 36:47.283
1990.

36:48.807 --> 36:51.975
Punched the shit
out of the wall.

36:51.976 --> 36:55.549
I don't know why. Seemed
important at the time.

36:58.683 --> 37:02.119
You guys look like you're
having a good night, though.

37:02.120 --> 37:05.101
I'm doing The Golden Mile tonight.
You want to tag along?

37:06.157 --> 37:08.967
We'll be like The Six Musketeers.

37:11.796 --> 37:14.470
I said we're doing
The Golden Mile.

37:17.769 --> 37:19.612
You think you're so cool,
don't you?

37:20.305 --> 37:21.306
Huh?

37:21.773 --> 37:23.474
But we were cooler.

37:23.475 --> 37:25.209
We owned this town.

37:25.210 --> 37:27.747
We paved the way for you lot.
Blazed a trail.

37:27.912 --> 37:30.047
Hey! Look at me when
I'm talking to you!

37:30.048 --> 37:32.119
Please don't.
Don't what?

37:32.517 --> 37:33.917
You don't want to do that.

37:33.918 --> 37:35.556
Don't I?

38:01.079 --> 38:02.683
What?

38:10.722 --> 38:12.623
You need to explain
this right now!

38:12.624 --> 38:13.891
Andy, this kid
just attacked me.

38:13.892 --> 38:14.958
Don't you dare
change the subject!

38:14.959 --> 38:15.994
He smashed my head
in the mirror.

38:16.094 --> 38:18.629
You know who I just spoke to?
Your mum!

38:18.630 --> 38:21.265
And not from the afterlife.
From fucking Bournemouth.

38:21.266 --> 38:22.399
Is that real?

38:22.400 --> 38:23.934
She says she hasn't spoken
to you for eight months.

38:23.935 --> 38:25.437
Andy...
His head just came off!

38:25.570 --> 38:28.038
No, Gary, you are not gonna
wriggle out of it this time.

39:54.325 --> 39:56.293
There's someone in here.

40:27.792 --> 40:28.998
Andy, did you see...

41:04.162 --> 41:08.999
WTF, Gary. WTF.

41:09.000 --> 41:12.072
What the fuck does "WTF" mean?

41:12.403 --> 41:14.713
What the fuck?
Oh, yeah.

41:15.440 --> 41:17.240
This can't be happening.
Can it?

41:17.241 --> 41:18.362
You said it, mate.

41:18.476 --> 41:20.210
I can't believe it.

41:20.211 --> 41:21.411
I know, mate.

41:21.412 --> 41:23.323
I can't believe you
lied about your mum!

41:23.481 --> 41:24.548
That was a white lie!

41:24.549 --> 41:27.117
How is that a white lie?
She's not dead, is she?

41:29.654 --> 41:32.322
Wait, wait, wait!
Where are you going?

41:32.323 --> 41:34.200
To get help.
No, don't do that!

41:34.325 --> 41:36.566
What, don't get help? We don't
know how far this goes.

41:37.895 --> 41:39.129
Wait, who are you calling?
Vanessa.

41:39.130 --> 41:40.230
Who's Vanessa?
My wife.

41:40.231 --> 41:42.065
Why are you calling your wife?
Because she's my wife.

41:42.066 --> 41:43.667
You just said we don't
know how far this goes.

41:43.668 --> 41:46.303
I was just thinking about the pub.
Oh, well, there's a surprise.

41:46.304 --> 41:47.704
I can't get through.

41:47.705 --> 41:48.905
Can you get through to Sam?

41:48.906 --> 41:50.607
I've got full bars and
I'm not getting through.

41:50.608 --> 41:56.446
<i>I'm sorry, your call
cannot be connected at this time.</i>

41:56.447 --> 41:57.858
Must be the network.

41:58.016 --> 42:02.294
Holy shit.
This is all connected.

42:03.588 --> 42:05.829
This explains why
everything's gone fuck up.

42:05.957 --> 42:07.324
Everybody's been replaced
by one of these.

42:07.325 --> 42:10.761
That's why no one recognized
us, Basil, Dave, Raymondo.

42:10.762 --> 42:13.397
I thought it was weird'
Shane Hawkins.

42:13.398 --> 42:17.367
Exactly. it's not us that's
changed, it's the town.

42:17.368 --> 42:19.469
I'm right, aren't I, Andy?

42:19.470 --> 42:21.838
Andy, aren't I right?
You're never wrong.

42:21.839 --> 42:25.343
No, whatever the fuck's happening,
we can't stay in the gents forever.

42:25.476 --> 42:27.319
Ten people have entered this
toilet in the last five minutes

42:27.445 --> 42:29.112
and not a single one
has come back out again.

42:29.113 --> 42:30.524
That's going to
look suspicious.

42:30.648 --> 42:32.059
Gay loving.

42:32.316 --> 42:34.159
And that's worse
than five dismembered bodies?

42:34.318 --> 42:36.787
This is Newton Haven.

42:47.832 --> 42:51.473
How's it looking?
Normal. Very normal.

42:51.769 --> 42:53.646
I don't like it.

42:53.838 --> 42:57.251
What do we do?
Let's finish our drinks.

43:09.454 --> 43:11.588
I say we neck these and
get the fuck out of here.

43:11.589 --> 43:12.989
To London?
To The Trusty Servant.

43:12.990 --> 43:15.163
Are you fucking kidding?
Oh, yeah.

43:15.960 --> 43:18.528
It's The Good Companions next.
I always mix those two up.

43:18.529 --> 43:20.363
Are you saying we move
on to the next pub?

43:20.364 --> 43:22.401
We should get in The Beast
and head back to London!

43:22.533 --> 43:24.877
My brake light is broken.
So don't use the brakes!

43:25.002 --> 43:27.070
I'm way over the limit. When
has that ever stopped you?

43:27.071 --> 43:29.847
I don't want to put any more
points on Pete's license.

43:29.974 --> 43:32.509
Andy can drive, he's teetotal!

43:43.721 --> 43:45.088
Ah!

43:45.089 --> 43:46.490
That's settles it then.

43:46.491 --> 43:48.692
The last thing we need to do is
get pulled over by the police.

43:48.693 --> 43:49.993
A, we're all drunk,

43:49.994 --> 43:52.863
B, they might be in on it and,
C, we've got blood on our hands.

43:52.864 --> 43:55.065
It's more like ink. We've
got ink on our hands.

43:55.066 --> 43:58.835
So, has it got messy yet? What?

43:58.836 --> 44:01.817
What are you, five pubs in?
Four.

44:02.240 --> 44:05.687
Oh, not even halfway.
Plenty more fun to be had.

44:06.944 --> 44:08.355
Enjoy your night, Peter.

44:08.479 --> 44:09.549
Thank you.

44:11.282 --> 44:12.556
Thank you.

44:16.053 --> 44:17.087
Sorry.

44:17.088 --> 44:19.322
The way I see it, we've told everybody
we were doing The Golden Mile.

44:19.323 --> 44:20.390
You did.

44:20.391 --> 44:22.159
If we suddenly jump in The Beast
now and head for the hills,

44:22.160 --> 44:23.493
they're gonna know
that we know,

44:23.494 --> 44:25.729
but if we keep doing what we're
doing and going where we're going,

44:25.730 --> 44:26.796
then they're not gonna know.

44:26.797 --> 44:27.998
Know what?
That we know.

44:27.999 --> 44:30.502
I suggest we finish what we started
and leave quietly in the morning.

44:30.635 --> 44:33.878
Wait. You're really suggesting...
We finish The Golden Mile.

44:34.438 --> 44:36.509
It's pointless
arguing with him.

44:36.874 --> 44:38.251
Drink up. Let's Boo-Boo.

44:44.682 --> 44:46.286
<i>We're just five friends</i>

44:47.118 --> 44:49.223
<i>on a night out,
having a good time.</i>

45:52.250 --> 45:53.750
Drinking.
Ah!

45:53.751 --> 45:55.151
Beer.
Pubs.

45:55.152 --> 45:56.426
Shall we?

46:01.559 --> 46:03.994
I feel a little
uncomfortable drinking this much.

46:03.995 --> 46:06.029
It's like Dutch
courage, isn't it?

46:06.030 --> 46:08.798
You know, when the English soldiers
used to drink Dutch gin before battle

46:08.799 --> 46:10.200
to give them super strength.

46:10.201 --> 46:12.736
You know, I thought that was to
numb the sense of impending doom.

46:12.737 --> 46:13.837
Exactly.

46:13.838 --> 46:16.876
We're just five friends on a
night out, having a good time.

46:38.562 --> 46:40.063
I need the toilet.

46:40.064 --> 46:42.932
Go on then. You've earned it.
Huh?

46:42.933 --> 46:45.106
You're doing really good, Oliver.

46:46.404 --> 46:48.907
He didn't make it this far last time.
I'm proud of him.

46:49.273 --> 46:51.007
You're enjoying this,
aren't you?

46:51.008 --> 46:53.511
Yeah, five guys on a night
out, having a great time.

46:53.611 --> 46:55.090
Pretending to have
a great time.

46:55.246 --> 46:56.413
Are you pretending?

46:56.414 --> 46:59.115
If we get out of here alive,
I'm going to kill you.

46:59.116 --> 47:00.784
We're still in the dark, Gary.

47:00.785 --> 47:03.391
Yeah, our families could be
in danger for all we know.

47:03.554 --> 47:07.400
I know, my mum could be dead.
For reals this time.

47:08.159 --> 47:11.538
Hey, why don't we just
ask somebody? Who?

47:12.596 --> 47:15.805
The Reverend Green.
Come on. Wait.

47:16.200 --> 47:17.734
What the fuck are you doing?

47:17.735 --> 47:20.682
I'm going to go and have a little
chat with The Reverend Green.

47:21.272 --> 47:22.444
You're going to buy drugs?

47:22.606 --> 47:25.917
I am going to go over there and subtly
check if that is The Reverend Green

47:26.077 --> 47:29.045
and if it is, I can ask him
what's going on,

47:29.046 --> 47:30.548
and possibly buy some drugs.

47:30.848 --> 47:32.515
But what if he's one of them?

47:32.516 --> 47:34.718
No, me and The Reverend had
a highly sophisticated code

47:34.719 --> 47:36.639
when discussing the purchase
of herbal narcotics.

47:36.854 --> 47:41.064
If he doesn't understand me, it means he's
one of them and I will simply walk away.

47:41.425 --> 47:42.426
Ah!

47:48.599 --> 47:51.434
Have you got any drugs? I
don't do that anymore, Gary.

47:51.435 --> 47:53.436
Do what?
That.

47:53.437 --> 47:54.804
That why you're
in a suit, is it?

47:54.805 --> 47:56.639
'Cause drug dealing is
not good enough for you?

47:56.640 --> 47:58.808
There are no drug
dealers anymore, Gary.

47:58.809 --> 48:00.710
I've got a proper job
in a proper office.

48:00.711 --> 48:03.313
You had a proper office.
That was the gents' toilets.

48:03.314 --> 48:05.482
Nothing wrong with doing
your business in the toilet.

48:05.483 --> 48:08.123
Look, a lot has changed since
you have left. I know.

48:08.285 --> 48:10.322
How much do you know?
A little.

48:10.454 --> 48:11.660
How much is a little?

48:11.856 --> 48:13.790
The town has been taken over
by robots full of blue stuff.

48:13.791 --> 48:14.958
Shh. Keep your voice down.

48:14.959 --> 48:16.326
You don't even know
what you're talking about.

48:16.327 --> 48:18.795
Tell us then.
Well, they're not robots.

48:18.796 --> 48:20.730
Do you even know
what robot means?

48:20.731 --> 48:24.474
Course I do. It's like,
"Hello, I am a robot."

48:24.635 --> 48:28.271
It means "slave" and believe
me, they are not slaves.

48:28.272 --> 48:30.473
Are you their prisoner?
No, I am very happy.

48:30.474 --> 48:31.646
Tell your face.

48:31.776 --> 48:34.010
Hey! What's going on?

48:34.011 --> 48:36.012
The town's been invaded
by robots who aren't robots

48:36.013 --> 48:37.924
and The Rev's their prisoner.
I am not.

48:38.449 --> 48:40.827
We're leaving first thing.
We can get you out of here.

48:41.085 --> 48:43.987
I'm not going. It's not what you think.
This is for all our benefit.

48:43.988 --> 48:47.458
You've said too much, Trevor.
Yeah, put a cork in it, Trevor.

48:47.558 --> 48:49.826
I'm just trying to help.
It's not your place to help.

48:49.827 --> 48:51.494
They will have
everything in hand.

48:51.495 --> 48:52.530
Are you guys robots?

48:52.696 --> 48:56.041
Well, the word robot actually
comes from an old Czech word...

48:56.200 --> 48:57.645
<i>...robotnik...</i>
...meaning slave.

48:57.835 --> 48:59.702
And we are not slaves.
We are very, very happy.

48:59.703 --> 49:00.909
And not robots.

49:01.038 --> 49:02.505
Oh, my God,
are these guys robots?

49:02.506 --> 49:03.706
Shut up about robots!

49:03.707 --> 49:05.375
I say we shut up
about everything!

49:12.216 --> 49:13.354
Trevor.

49:15.686 --> 49:18.132
It's your supervisor.

49:20.424 --> 49:22.961
Hello, Trevor.
Hello, sir.

49:25.129 --> 49:26.767
But...

49:27.665 --> 49:29.042
I understand.

49:49.954 --> 49:51.365
Thanks a bunch.

49:57.628 --> 49:59.039
What did I miss?

49:59.163 --> 50:01.164
Your friends trying to help.

50:01.165 --> 50:02.439
We don't need your help.

50:02.566 --> 50:03.874
Well, what should we do?

50:04.468 --> 50:07.608
I suggest you get on your way.

50:09.507 --> 50:11.248
I think we should
do what he says.

50:12.076 --> 50:13.419
Okay.

50:21.118 --> 50:22.324
Here we go.

50:25.956 --> 50:27.790
Come on!
Gary.

50:27.791 --> 50:29.192
Gary!

50:29.193 --> 50:31.361
Let's just get in and
out of this one, yeah?

50:31.362 --> 50:33.103
No more making new friends.

50:33.831 --> 50:37.133
Gentlemen!
The prodigal sons return!

50:37.134 --> 50:40.081
What will it be, one of
our guest ales perchance?

50:41.105 --> 50:43.873
Might I recommend
five pints of Crowning Glory?

50:43.874 --> 50:46.910
Rather fitting, wouldn't you say, Gary?
What? Sorry. What?

50:46.911 --> 50:50.046
It's a delightful brew.
Hoppy, nutty, foamy,

50:50.047 --> 50:53.187
Does it have a surprisingly fruity
note that lingers on the tongue?

50:53.484 --> 50:55.930
You're obviously a connoisseur.

50:56.120 --> 50:57.987
Then you'll already
know that it's a rare treat

50:57.988 --> 51:01.991
for rogues, reverends, royalty
and all good folks between.

51:01.992 --> 51:03.626
Five of those, please.

51:03.627 --> 51:05.573
Welcome home, boys.

51:09.967 --> 51:11.801
I don't remember him
being that friendly.

51:11.802 --> 51:14.180
He's obviously one of them.

51:14.305 --> 51:15.905
How can he be?
He remembered me.

51:15.906 --> 51:17.373
We don't know
what they remember.

51:17.374 --> 51:18.819
Maybe they
have selective memories.

51:18.976 --> 51:20.877
Yeah, like what's his name?
Me.

51:20.878 --> 51:22.812
Maybe he's one of the others.
Like The Reverend.

51:22.813 --> 51:24.156
It is very hard
to tell, isn't it?

51:24.281 --> 51:26.249
Yeah, I mean, is he one of
them or is he one of them?

51:26.250 --> 51:28.084
Wait, wait, which ones
are the thems again?

51:28.085 --> 51:29.359
Well, they're both thems,
aren't they?

51:29.486 --> 51:30.720
But there's two ways
of saying it.

51:30.721 --> 51:32.855
Is he one of them or
is he one of them?

51:32.856 --> 51:34.157
We need different terms.

51:34.158 --> 51:38.129
One for the people who aren't robots and
one for the robots who aren't robots.

51:39.330 --> 51:44.404
All right, we need to be able to
differentiate between them, them and us.

51:44.635 --> 51:46.436
Yeah, I think the pronouns
are really confusing.

51:46.437 --> 51:48.438
Yes. I don't even
know what a pronoun is.

51:48.439 --> 51:50.506
It's a word that can
function by itself as a noun

51:50.507 --> 51:52.175
which refers to something
else in the discourse.

51:52.176 --> 51:53.519
I don't get it.
You just used one.

51:53.644 --> 51:55.011
Did I?
Yeah. "It" is a pronoun.

51:55.012 --> 51:56.045
What is?
It.

51:56.046 --> 51:57.113
Is it?
Christ.

51:57.114 --> 51:59.983
Look, we just need a fucking word
so we can identify who's who.

51:59.984 --> 52:04.763
He's a blank, she's a blank, those
two people are definitely blanks.

52:06.690 --> 52:07.668
Sam.

52:08.826 --> 52:10.271
I got this, Steve.

52:13.464 --> 52:14.909
All right, Sam?
Oh, crumbs.

52:15.366 --> 52:17.166
How's your night going?

52:17.167 --> 52:19.511
Good. Sort of.

52:20.237 --> 52:22.239
What do you mean "sort of"?

52:23.574 --> 52:25.952
Well, it's weird, isn't it?

52:26.076 --> 52:30.149
You come back and everything's
the same, but sort of different.

52:30.280 --> 52:31.850
Different how?

52:32.049 --> 52:33.528
Just weird.

52:33.651 --> 52:35.096
How weird?

52:35.953 --> 52:36.954
What are you getting at, Gary?

52:37.087 --> 52:38.566
Come with me.

52:41.125 --> 52:42.892
Puck's sake, Gary, take a hint.

52:42.893 --> 52:44.293
It's all right, I'm not
trying to have sex with you.

52:44.294 --> 52:45.762
Why are we in the
disabled toilets then?

52:45.763 --> 52:47.030
There's something I need
to tell you right now,

52:47.031 --> 52:48.331
unless you do want to have sex,

52:48.332 --> 52:49.432
in which case
I'll tell you afterwards.

52:49.433 --> 52:50.434
Tell me right now.

52:50.567 --> 52:51.934
Have you noticed anything
creepy about The Twins

52:51.935 --> 52:53.069
apart from the fact
that they're twins?

52:53.070 --> 52:55.505
Just because they're twins doesn't
automatically make them creepy.

52:55.506 --> 52:57.240
It does a little bit.
You had sex with them.

52:57.241 --> 53:00.620
A, I did not, and, B, how
did you know about that?

53:00.744 --> 53:03.613
A, it's a small town, B, I'm not
stupid and, C, they told me.

53:03.614 --> 53:05.448
Right. Well, I did once,
but I was wasted,

53:05.449 --> 53:07.350
which was creepy because it was
like there was four of them.

53:07.351 --> 53:08.951
I am not proud of it.
I am a bit.

53:08.952 --> 53:11.587
Is this what you wanted to tell me?
No, this is...

53:14.825 --> 53:15.997
Are you okay, Sam?
Are you okay, Sam?

53:16.126 --> 53:17.605
I need a cigarette.

53:18.595 --> 53:21.130
Nobots?
How about Fauxbots?

53:21.131 --> 53:23.166
I think we should get away
from the whole robots thing.

53:23.167 --> 53:24.271
Steven?

53:24.735 --> 53:25.907
What's he up to?

53:26.704 --> 53:29.472
Oh, don't worry, he's probably just
trying to fuck Oliver's sister.

53:29.473 --> 53:30.474
Andy.

53:32.276 --> 53:33.949
Oh, my God,
that man is full of shit.

53:35.079 --> 53:36.846
I know that's not
a surprise to you.

53:36.847 --> 53:38.793
What did he say, Sam?
What did he say, Sam?

53:39.016 --> 53:44.295
He said that Newton Haven has been taken
over by robots full of blue stuff

53:44.455 --> 53:46.989
and if we don't do what they say,
they will make us their prisoners.

53:46.990 --> 53:48.628
Did you believe him?
Did you believe him?

53:48.959 --> 53:51.166
No, of course not.

53:53.330 --> 53:55.173
Did you believe him?
Did you believe him?

53:55.999 --> 53:57.433
What?

54:09.713 --> 54:11.881
See?
Come on, Sam.

54:11.882 --> 54:13.862
You know better than
to believe Gary King,

54:15.519 --> 54:16.520
Oh, crumbs.

54:18.055 --> 54:19.033
Sam!

54:27.664 --> 54:30.406
God!
You creepy bitches, get off!

54:46.150 --> 54:47.151
Chuck us a ciggie.

54:47.518 --> 54:48.519
Oh.

54:51.989 --> 54:53.790
Gary, what's happening?

54:53.791 --> 54:56.397
I told you in the disableds.
Oh, yes, you did.

54:56.627 --> 54:57.867
We should get inside, eh?

54:58.095 --> 55:00.803
Otherwise people are going to
ask what the hell's going on.

55:00.998 --> 55:02.198
What the hell's going on?

55:02.199 --> 55:03.599
Steve, I got this.
Got what?

55:03.600 --> 55:05.935
Sam, he's not good
enough for you.

55:05.936 --> 55:07.003
What?
What?

55:07.004 --> 55:09.644
We've been through
some crazy shit tonight

55:10.707 --> 55:13.709
and it's really put things
in perspective for me,

55:13.710 --> 55:18.125
and if everything is as fucked up as it seems,
then there's something I need to tell you.

55:19.249 --> 55:23.152
You might think this is because
I've had seven pints, but it's not.

55:23.153 --> 55:24.154
It's not.

55:24.888 --> 55:26.526
I'm in love with you, Sam.

55:26.890 --> 55:28.392
I always have been,

55:28.792 --> 55:32.995
and it breaks my heart to see you waste
your affections on Gary fucking King.

55:32.996 --> 55:35.636
Hey, that's a bit harsh. Oh,
no, you've got it all wrong.

55:35.766 --> 55:37.934
There's nothing between...
And while I'm being honest,

55:37.935 --> 55:41.838
just to lay it all out there, I am
currently seeing a fitness instructor.

55:41.839 --> 55:43.250
She's 26 years old,

55:43.407 --> 55:46.175
but I would drop her in
a heartbeat if it meant

55:46.176 --> 55:47.814
that I had one last chance
with you.

55:48.011 --> 55:51.185
Steven, there's nothing
between me and Gary King.

55:53.917 --> 55:54.918
Oh, fuck.

56:13.403 --> 56:14.973
Sorry.

56:22.446 --> 56:24.551
Hey! Get your feet off her!

56:29.286 --> 56:31.766
Pop its head off! Pop its head
off like an aspirin bottle.

56:38.795 --> 56:39.865
Blue-bloods?

56:39.997 --> 56:42.231
Nothing suggested in
the last three minutes

56:42.232 --> 56:44.000
has been better than
Smashy-Smashy Egg Men.

56:44.001 --> 56:45.668
Nothing.
What the hell's going on?

56:45.669 --> 56:48.004
Did you guys think of a name for
the robots who aren't robots?

56:48.005 --> 56:50.439
I'm afraid we've drawn a blank.

56:50.440 --> 56:53.242
Well, we just had a barney with
two blanks in the beer garden.

56:53.243 --> 56:54.916
- We have to leave now!
- Agreed.

56:59.049 --> 57:00.349
Let's hit The Mermaid.

57:00.350 --> 57:02.118
Wait, what?
Number eight.

57:02.119 --> 57:03.152
"Number eight"?

57:03.153 --> 57:05.429
Oh, fuck.
Andy, what's happening?

57:05.923 --> 57:09.234
Gary thinks we should keep on with the
crawl because they know what we're doing,

57:09.359 --> 57:11.494
but they don't know that we
know what they're doing.

57:11.495 --> 57:14.772
And basically no one else
has a better idea, so fuck it.

57:16.466 --> 57:17.604
What?

57:18.769 --> 57:19.747
Wait!

57:24.041 --> 57:26.509
Guys! Guys!
I've got a better idea.

57:26.510 --> 57:28.544
I'm parked right round
here somewhere.

57:28.545 --> 57:31.147
Haul it. Just go!
Steven, tell them!

57:31.148 --> 57:33.416
Gary said they'll get us
if we try and leave now.

57:33.417 --> 57:36.057
We're way past leaving now.
Come on.

57:49.733 --> 57:51.269
Oh, yeah.

57:52.035 --> 57:53.970
This is what the kids want.

57:53.971 --> 57:55.404
This is a bit mad, isn't it?

57:55.405 --> 57:58.249
This is perfect. We can hide out in here.
I'll get the drinks in.

57:58.375 --> 57:59.875
Good plan, O-Man.
Hey!

57:59.876 --> 58:01.446
Keep an eye out for blanks.

58:01.712 --> 58:02.713
You've got it.

58:14.024 --> 58:17.126
Why didn't you say anything?
About what?

58:17.127 --> 58:18.970
About what you said
in the garden.

58:20.364 --> 58:21.630
I always wanted to.

58:21.631 --> 58:23.632
It just never seemed
like the right moment.

58:23.633 --> 58:25.601
Something always
got in the way.

58:25.602 --> 58:27.639
Here you go,
get these down you.

58:28.238 --> 58:29.239
Thanks.

58:29.406 --> 58:31.613
Steven?

58:36.279 --> 58:39.448
Please! I have so
much to live for!

58:39.449 --> 58:41.517
It's me, you numpty.
Basil!

58:41.518 --> 58:44.453
I knew seeing your faces again
would spell trouble.

58:44.454 --> 58:46.832
Wait. How do I know
it's really you?

58:47.024 --> 58:51.769
Because I'm the only one who's going to
tell you the truth about Newton Haven.

58:52.596 --> 58:56.866
Now, do you recall the events of
the evening of June the 22nd, 1990?

58:56.867 --> 58:58.869
No, but I know a man who does.

59:02.239 --> 59:04.040
Here you go.
Hey.

59:04.041 --> 59:06.021
See anyone we know?

59:11.815 --> 59:13.886
The Marmalade Sandwich.
The Marmalade Sandwich.

59:20.424 --> 59:21.596
They look good.

59:24.327 --> 59:26.705
It's the lights.
It's the drink.

59:30.734 --> 59:32.270
Who cares what it is?

59:34.071 --> 59:35.243
Steven?

59:36.640 --> 59:37.641
Steven?

59:38.809 --> 59:40.309
That was the night
they arrived.

59:40.310 --> 59:42.545
Remember the shooting star?
That was them.

59:42.546 --> 59:43.889
Nothing happened at first.

59:44.014 --> 59:47.750
They were getting ready, burrowing
in underground, preparing.

59:47.751 --> 59:50.886
<i>Not long after you lot left,
people started to change.</i>

59:50.887 --> 59:52.798
<i>Just one or two at first,
then more.</i>

59:52.923 --> 59:56.336
They replaced people of influence,
taking over the institutions,

59:56.593 --> 59:59.802
<i>remaking, remodeling,
refurbishing.</i>

59:59.930 --> 01:00:01.850
Doing everything they could
to make us join them.

01:00:09.506 --> 01:00:13.477
I can't find Steven.
Where are the others?

01:00:14.311 --> 01:00:15.517
They're blending in.

01:00:18.682 --> 01:00:20.059
Oh, crumbs.

01:00:20.283 --> 01:00:23.352
It's not like the replacements
were evil, far from it.

01:00:23.353 --> 01:00:26.994
People got a lot friendlier.
That's how they do it,

01:00:27.724 --> 01:00:30.559
<i>It's not an invasion,
it's a merger.</i>

01:00:30.560 --> 01:00:33.541
<i>They don't want to get rid of
us, not if they can help it.</i>

01:00:33.864 --> 01:00:36.632
<i>They just want to make
us more like them.</i>

01:00:36.633 --> 01:00:38.534
<i>Change the way we think.</i>

01:00:38.535 --> 01:00:40.703
<i>Bring us into line
with all the others.</i>

01:00:40.704 --> 01:00:42.706
<i>Become another
link in their chain.</i>

01:00:43.173 --> 01:00:45.551
<i>Which is fine,
unless you say no.</i>

01:00:46.710 --> 01:00:48.410
That's when you get replaced.

01:00:48.411 --> 01:00:50.713
Once they get your DNA,
they've got you.

01:00:50.714 --> 01:00:51.881
How do they do that?

01:00:51.882 --> 01:00:53.215
<i>Any way they like.</i>

01:00:53.216 --> 01:00:59.064
<i>Blood tests, the nit nurse, sweat,
kissing, saliva on the rim of a glass.</i>

01:00:59.689 --> 01:01:02.358
Why do you think
I drink with this crazy straw?

01:01:02.359 --> 01:01:03.736
Not so crazy now, is it?

01:01:03.994 --> 01:01:06.975
If you're not on their side,
they'll create a version that is.

01:01:07.397 --> 01:01:11.277
<i>They can bring you back exactly the
same or even make you young again.</i>

01:01:11.768 --> 01:01:13.702
<i>It looks like you, it
even has your memories,</i>

01:01:13.703 --> 01:01:16.238
<i>but really it's just a vessel
to spread their message.</i>

01:01:16.239 --> 01:01:20.609
<i>Trust, love, respect, desire.</i>

01:01:20.610 --> 01:01:23.352
<i>Replaced in the name
of progress.</i>

01:01:24.614 --> 01:01:26.992
So, what happens to the
people who get replaced?

01:01:27.117 --> 01:01:30.186
The empties? Don't ask
me what happens to them.

01:01:30.187 --> 01:01:31.554
Why, what happens
to the empties?

01:01:31.555 --> 01:01:33.255
I told you not to ask me that!

01:01:33.256 --> 01:01:35.532
Go! Get out,
before it's too late!

01:01:39.629 --> 01:01:41.631
Basil?
I said go!

01:01:45.669 --> 01:01:47.114
This just can't be good.

01:01:47.437 --> 01:01:50.350
Sam, who was the boy that you
liked in sixth form? Adrian?

01:01:51.174 --> 01:01:53.654
Adrian Keane. Why?

01:01:54.277 --> 01:01:55.483
He's over there.

01:02:04.521 --> 01:02:07.161
Hey, Sam.
How's life?

01:02:11.528 --> 01:02:13.629
Sam, we have to get out of here!
We have to get out of here!

01:02:13.630 --> 01:02:15.803
Where are the others?
They're blending in.

01:02:17.601 --> 01:02:19.239
Oh, fuck!

01:02:21.638 --> 01:02:23.481
Gary! No, just one more song.

01:02:23.873 --> 01:02:25.874
Gary, she's a blank!

01:02:25.875 --> 01:02:27.309
Don't be so judgmental.

01:02:27.310 --> 01:02:28.311
Oh, for fuck...

01:02:30.680 --> 01:02:31.681
Oh, yeah.
Come on.

01:02:31.881 --> 01:02:33.292
Still got it.
Enough's enough.

01:02:33.550 --> 01:02:34.683
Let's go.

01:02:34.684 --> 01:02:36.960
Whoa, whoa, whoa, hold up.
Hold up.

01:02:37.287 --> 01:02:38.391
Where are you all going?

01:02:38.521 --> 01:02:40.589
We're leaving.
Really? What happened?

01:02:40.590 --> 01:02:42.524
Adrian Keane was in that bar.
Prick.

01:02:42.525 --> 01:02:44.026
I thought you liked
Adrian Keane.

01:02:44.027 --> 01:02:45.728
Adrian Keane is dead.
Oh, God.

01:02:45.729 --> 01:02:48.797
Adrian Keane died in a motorbike
accident in Italy eight years ago.

01:02:48.798 --> 01:02:50.666
Did he? They must have
had his DNA on file.

01:02:50.667 --> 01:02:52.010
That's how they were
able to replicate him.

01:02:52.202 --> 01:02:54.322
They know how to get to us, man.
They know everything.

01:02:54.471 --> 01:02:57.039
They didn't know Adrian was dead.
They knew enough to tempt us.

01:02:57.040 --> 01:02:59.575
They knew these three would fall for
a bunch of girls in school uniform.

01:02:59.576 --> 01:03:03.078
Hey, who wouldn't? Am I right?
Fuck, yeah.

01:03:03.079 --> 01:03:04.213
We've gotta get out of town,

01:03:04.214 --> 01:03:05.625
we've gotta get beyond it
before it's too late.

01:03:05.882 --> 01:03:07.650
- Where are you getting all this from?
- Basil.

01:03:07.651 --> 01:03:10.953
Mad Basil? He of the Bermuda
Rhombus and the Aqua Nazis?

01:03:10.954 --> 01:03:13.188
Another good name
for the band, Steve.

01:03:13.189 --> 01:03:15.024
You're putting our lives in
the hands of a crazy old man?

01:03:15.025 --> 01:03:16.595
He's not crazy!
No, maybe he's not.

01:03:16.760 --> 01:03:18.694
Or maybe he's a blank trying to
lure us to the edge of town,

01:03:18.695 --> 01:03:21.196
onto those dark country roads
where they can deal with us.

01:03:21.197 --> 01:03:24.566
Yeah, we could end up dead in a field.
I hate fields.

01:03:24.567 --> 01:03:26.843
Yes. My thoughts precisely.

01:03:27.404 --> 01:03:29.405
Steven's right.
We should go.

01:03:29.406 --> 01:03:30.806
No, we're going to The Beehive.

01:03:30.807 --> 01:03:32.309
Gary's plan is still
the best we have.

01:03:33.209 --> 01:03:34.187
Wait a minute.

01:03:36.680 --> 01:03:39.718
The 1990-model Oliver was out of
commission by this point in the evening.

01:03:41.151 --> 01:03:42.152
What are you saying?

01:03:44.087 --> 01:03:46.288
I like the new you.
Huh.

01:03:46.289 --> 01:03:47.267
Come on.

01:03:48.792 --> 01:03:50.426
This is a mistake, isn't it?

01:03:50.427 --> 01:03:51.748
Hold up!
Just stick with me.

01:03:52.395 --> 01:03:53.533
Andy, come on!

01:03:55.465 --> 01:03:58.233
Here we go. Pub number nine.

01:03:58.234 --> 01:03:59.268
Fuck yes!

01:03:59.269 --> 01:04:01.749
That's the spirit, Pete!
Spirits! We should do chasers.

01:04:01.871 --> 01:04:03.238
Who is this guy?

01:04:03.239 --> 01:04:06.686
Come on. Andy!
It can't start without you.

01:04:09.346 --> 01:04:10.347
You what?

01:04:10.847 --> 01:04:12.918
We can't start without you.

01:04:17.454 --> 01:04:19.832
Now then.
Whose round is it?

01:04:20.123 --> 01:04:21.431
It's mine.

01:04:23.093 --> 01:04:24.902
Mr. Shepherd!
Is it Mr. Shepherd?

01:04:25.195 --> 01:04:29.268
Why don't you kids join me? You
look like you could do with a drink.

01:04:30.800 --> 01:04:35.806
Now, let's have a little chat
about your future, shall we, hmm?

01:04:36.039 --> 01:04:39.282
Uh, Mr. Shepherd?
Please, call me Guy.

01:04:40.610 --> 01:04:41.588
All right.

01:04:43.279 --> 01:04:44.280
Guy...

01:04:45.281 --> 01:04:46.692
Look at you.

01:04:49.352 --> 01:04:50.422
Are you a robot?

01:04:51.121 --> 01:04:53.601
Does anyone know
what robot means?

01:04:53.757 --> 01:04:54.929
Yeah. I do!
Yes, Gary.

01:04:55.358 --> 01:04:56.925
It means "slave."

01:04:56.926 --> 01:04:58.906
Oh, very good, Gary.

01:04:59.396 --> 01:05:00.929
Are you a robot, sir?

01:05:00.930 --> 01:05:03.843
No, Peter, of course
I'm not a robot.

01:05:03.967 --> 01:05:04.945
Sir?
Yes, Steven.

01:05:05.068 --> 01:05:06.468
But you're on their
side, though?

01:05:06.469 --> 01:05:09.211
This is not about
sides, Steven.

01:05:09.372 --> 01:05:11.511
It's not about shirts
versus skins.

01:05:11.641 --> 01:05:15.282
It's about working
together as one team.

01:05:15.445 --> 01:05:18.983
I know it may seem a bit weird
and a little bit scary,

01:05:19.649 --> 01:05:21.788
but please believe me,
it's quite the opposite,

01:05:21.918 --> 01:05:23.552
They're here to help.

01:05:23.553 --> 01:05:27.000
To straighten us out. To
prepare us for the big league.

01:05:27.357 --> 01:05:30.668
They've seen something
in us, a potential.

01:05:30.794 --> 01:05:33.331
There's a vast community
of worlds up there,

01:05:33.496 --> 01:05:37.706
living together, peacefully,
cooperatively.

01:05:38.201 --> 01:05:41.205
And guess what? They want
us along for the ride.

01:05:43.072 --> 01:05:45.245
Pretty cool, eh, gang?

01:05:45.375 --> 01:05:47.946
So,
they're not here to harm us?

01:05:48.344 --> 01:05:52.514
Far from it, O-Man.
No, they're here to help.

01:05:52.515 --> 01:05:55.384
I'm not saying they're
afraid to get tough.

01:05:55.385 --> 01:05:58.127
I certainly had to get
tough with you in my day.

01:05:58.521 --> 01:06:01.661
And what one amongst you
wouldn't thank me for it? Hmm?

01:06:01.891 --> 01:06:05.227
In some respects,
they're a lot like teachers.

01:06:05.228 --> 01:06:09.598
Stern, yes.
A little frightening.

01:06:09.599 --> 01:06:11.101
But it's all for
our betterment.

01:06:12.035 --> 01:06:17.986
So, what do you say we all go somewhere
and talk about this properly?

01:06:18.241 --> 01:06:19.441
That wasn't properly?

01:06:19.442 --> 01:06:23.083
Well, I think it's pretty clear, guys, what
Mr. Shepherd is trying to say is that...

01:06:25.715 --> 01:06:28.025
Andy! What the fuck?

01:06:28.284 --> 01:06:30.730
Yes, Andy. What the fuck?

01:06:35.391 --> 01:06:39.396
Humans, you leave
us no recourse.

01:06:39.629 --> 01:06:42.610
If you will not
join us willingly,

01:06:43.032 --> 01:06:47.069
we will be forced to use
other means of persuasion.

01:06:47.070 --> 01:06:48.708
Now, please...

01:06:56.079 --> 01:06:57.956
I fucking hate this town!

01:07:38.588 --> 01:07:39.794
Oh, oh!

01:07:47.363 --> 01:07:49.240
Oh, crumbs, you're heavy. Sorry.

01:08:13.856 --> 01:08:15.164
Motherfucker!

01:08:34.911 --> 01:08:36.584
Andy!

01:08:36.813 --> 01:08:38.156
Twist the melon, man!

01:08:40.950 --> 01:08:42.361
Yeah!

01:08:44.453 --> 01:08:48.197
Sam, this is no way
for a family to behave.

01:08:56.966 --> 01:08:59.412
Sam, I'm disappointed in you.

01:09:05.841 --> 01:09:07.844
O-Man!

01:09:22.558 --> 01:09:23.559
Okay, Andy.

01:09:23.926 --> 01:09:25.234
Break it up.

01:09:26.929 --> 01:09:28.567
It doesn't have
to be like this.

01:09:29.765 --> 01:09:35.808
It could be so much simpler,
so completely painless.

01:09:36.673 --> 01:09:38.840
If only you'd see the light.

01:09:38.841 --> 01:09:40.075
Yes.

01:09:40.076 --> 01:09:43.683
See, it's not about conflict,

01:09:45.648 --> 01:09:47.448
it's about togetherness.

01:09:47.450 --> 01:09:50.555
Yes. Let's try this
again, shall we?

01:09:51.154 --> 01:09:52.154
How about another round?

01:09:52.721 --> 01:09:56.602
Nah, we're done here.

01:09:57.393 --> 01:10:01.029
Yes, Gary, that appears to be the case.

01:10:01.030 --> 01:10:02.441
The Smokehouse!

01:10:02.932 --> 01:10:04.138
What?
Just do it!

01:10:05.134 --> 01:10:06.112
Come on!

01:10:07.036 --> 01:10:08.037
This way!

01:10:18.014 --> 01:10:20.916
Humans,
this is your final warning.

01:10:20.917 --> 01:10:23.193
Failure to comply
will result in your...

01:10:24.954 --> 01:10:28.424
Humans, obey now,
or face the consequences.

01:10:31.794 --> 01:10:32.795
Let's go!

01:10:41.904 --> 01:10:43.042
Shit.

01:10:43.806 --> 01:10:45.012
Oh, look, there's my car!

01:10:47.844 --> 01:10:49.084
Let's climb down the drainpipe.

01:10:50.246 --> 01:10:51.816
I've got a better idea.

01:10:55.284 --> 01:10:56.763
Climb down the drainpipe.

01:11:00.590 --> 01:11:01.790
Okay, just go.

01:11:01.791 --> 01:11:02.824
Wait. What about the others?

01:11:02.825 --> 01:11:04.392
Leave 'em with me, okay?
I got this.

01:11:04.393 --> 01:11:06.304
Are you sure? Yeah, I
always land on my feet.

01:11:06.829 --> 01:11:08.150
I don't know
if that's true, Gary.

01:11:08.664 --> 01:11:09.665
Just go.

01:11:10.233 --> 01:11:12.034
Will you find out what
happened to my brother?

01:11:12.201 --> 01:11:15.705
Yeah, of course, of course, and
I'll look after Stevie for you, eh?

01:11:16.372 --> 01:11:19.046
He's a good guy.
He's better than me.

01:11:19.776 --> 01:11:23.314
Gary, you're not a bad person, but
you're not boyfriend material.

01:11:24.280 --> 01:11:27.082
The whole "free spirit quick one
in the disabled toilets" thing

01:11:27.083 --> 01:11:30.860
is kinda cool when you're 17,
but not when you're facing 40.

01:11:31.888 --> 01:11:35.335
There comes a time when you have
to go forwards and not backwards.

01:11:36.359 --> 01:11:39.359
Maybe if I hadn't left you behind that
night, things would all be different.

01:11:40.196 --> 01:11:41.800
It's not all about
that night, Gary.

01:11:42.765 --> 01:11:43.766
Isn't it?

01:11:44.400 --> 01:11:45.674
It doesn't have to be.

01:11:48.004 --> 01:11:49.964
We'll always have the
disableds, though, won't we?

01:11:50.873 --> 01:11:53.444
Yeah. Yeah, we'll always
have the disableds.

01:12:15.598 --> 01:12:16.599
Oh, no.

01:12:28.811 --> 01:12:30.256
Where's Sam?

01:12:30.513 --> 01:12:31.719
I put her in her car.

01:12:31.881 --> 01:12:32.916
You did what?

01:12:33.049 --> 01:12:34.995
I put her in her car.
I just told her to leave.

01:12:35.117 --> 01:12:37.919
You just sent away the only one
of us sober enough to drive?

01:12:37.920 --> 01:12:40.255
Yeah. You just couldn't
stand the fact

01:12:40.256 --> 01:12:41.723
that she might
prefer me to you.

01:12:41.724 --> 01:12:43.397
That's not true.
It is true, Gary!

01:12:43.726 --> 01:12:45.433
I was getting somewhere.
We held hands.

01:12:45.695 --> 01:12:48.263
I was just trying to help! You were
trying to help yourself, more like!

01:12:48.264 --> 01:12:51.233
Jesus, I do something right for a
change and you fuckers get on my case.

01:12:51.234 --> 01:12:54.545
Wow, that's the first time I've
ever heard you admit being wrong.

01:12:54.670 --> 01:12:56.404
I said I did something right!

01:12:56.405 --> 01:12:57.672
Yeah, "for a change".

01:12:57.673 --> 01:12:59.875
So? Meaning the rest
of the time you're wrong.

01:12:59.876 --> 01:13:01.543
Not necessarily.

01:13:01.544 --> 01:13:04.880
Look, I just thought it was best
to keep her out of harm's way.

01:13:04.881 --> 01:13:07.249
And what about us, Gary?
Aren't we in harm's way?

01:13:07.250 --> 01:13:09.951
We're all right, Pete. Come on,
we're The Five Musketeers.

01:13:09.952 --> 01:13:12.023
No, we're the Four Musketeers.

01:13:14.190 --> 01:13:17.637
Wait, how do we know
you put her in the car?

01:13:18.394 --> 01:13:19.961
How do we know you're you?

01:13:19.962 --> 01:13:21.162
Of course I'm me!

01:13:21.163 --> 01:13:24.474
Well, who the fuck are you, Gary?
I'm Gary King.

01:13:25.001 --> 01:13:27.602
There's only one Gary King. How
do I know you guys are you?

01:13:27.603 --> 01:13:29.014
We've been together
the whole time.

01:13:29.238 --> 01:13:32.507
You might all not be you. How did
you know O-Man wasn't O-Man?

01:13:32.508 --> 01:13:34.509
Because his birthmark was back.

01:13:34.510 --> 01:13:36.845
What does that prove?
Because of what Basil said.

01:13:36.846 --> 01:13:38.480
They make a copy from your DNA.

01:13:38.481 --> 01:13:39.848
That's why he had
his birthmark.

01:13:39.849 --> 01:13:41.316
He was new, like a baby.

01:13:41.317 --> 01:13:43.285
Like a man-baby.
Like a "maybe".

01:13:43.286 --> 01:13:45.527
Oliver with none of the shit that
had happened to the real Oliver.

01:13:45.688 --> 01:13:47.722
The laser surgery!

01:13:47.723 --> 01:13:49.168
So the blanks really
are just blank?

01:13:49.592 --> 01:13:52.539
No wear and tear, no scars.

01:13:52.895 --> 01:13:55.430
Steven, in 1987 we were playing
cricket and I accidentally pushed you

01:13:55.431 --> 01:13:57.632
onto a broken bottle that
nearly went up your ass.

01:13:57.633 --> 01:13:58.907
So?
Show us your bum.

01:14:04.840 --> 01:14:06.374
Very nice.
Thank you.

01:14:06.375 --> 01:14:09.044
Pete, you got that 50cc
Suzuki in 1988,

01:14:09.045 --> 01:14:11.206
and you let me have a go on it
and I ran over your leg.

01:14:13.316 --> 01:14:14.582
What the fuck?

01:14:14.583 --> 01:14:16.722
Oh, wait, it's the other one.

01:14:19.255 --> 01:14:22.429
Andy, in 1986 we re-enacted
the Knife Game from <i>Aliens</i>

01:14:22.558 --> 01:14:23.992
and I stabbed you
in the middle finger.

01:14:23.993 --> 01:14:27.696
How about December 1997,
when you OD'd

01:14:27.697 --> 01:14:30.632
and I drove you to the hospital
four times over the limit

01:14:30.633 --> 01:14:34.636
and I ended up rolling the car and
almost severing my femoral artery,

01:14:34.637 --> 01:14:37.439
at which point you made
a miraculous fucking recovery

01:14:37.440 --> 01:14:40.709
and ran off into the night,
leaving me to get arrested

01:14:40.710 --> 01:14:42.747
after 12 hours of
life-saving surgery?

01:14:43.346 --> 01:14:44.552
Either one of those will do.

01:14:47.149 --> 01:14:49.151
Thank you.
What about you?

01:14:49.251 --> 01:14:50.594
That's easy.

01:14:52.288 --> 01:14:54.956
That could have been drawn on.
Aren't all tattoos drawn on?

01:14:54.957 --> 01:14:57.233
- Yeah.
- Show us your arm.

01:14:57.827 --> 01:15:00.603
What?
Show us your arm.

01:15:01.664 --> 01:15:02.734
No, no.

01:15:02.865 --> 01:15:07.669
You fell off stage at the fifth-year ball
fucking around and dislocated your elbow.

01:15:07.670 --> 01:15:09.904
You've got a scar where they
put the metal plate in.

01:15:09.905 --> 01:15:11.806
I don't have to show
you anything, all right?

01:15:11.807 --> 01:15:14.175
I'm Gary King.
I know I'm me.

01:15:14.176 --> 01:15:17.212
If I'm not me, then how do I know that
carved into that beam above your head

01:15:17.213 --> 01:15:19.247
are the words "King Gary"?

01:15:19.248 --> 01:15:20.448
But it doesn't say "King Gary".

01:15:20.449 --> 01:15:22.929
Yes, it does.
Doesn't it?

01:15:23.119 --> 01:15:25.920
No. It says "King Gay".

01:15:25.921 --> 01:15:28.800
Some cunt scrubbed out the "R"!

01:15:28.958 --> 01:15:30.392
- That was me.
- Why?

01:15:30.393 --> 01:15:33.028
"King Gay".
That means fuck-all anyway.

01:15:33.029 --> 01:15:35.168
Mr. Shepherd remembered
stuff, so did Oliver.

01:15:35.431 --> 01:15:37.468
Selective memory, remember?

01:15:39.568 --> 01:15:43.448
We don't see you for years and you
just pitch up and bring us here.

01:15:44.006 --> 01:15:46.446
You better come out with some
hard evidence that you're human,

01:15:47.076 --> 01:15:49.352
otherwise we're going to
find out for ourselves.

01:15:50.713 --> 01:15:52.852
You want evidence?

01:15:54.316 --> 01:15:55.488
There!

01:16:00.256 --> 01:16:01.291
That proves I'm human!

01:16:01.490 --> 01:16:02.557
It proves you're stupid.

01:16:02.558 --> 01:16:03.892
Exactly!

01:16:03.893 --> 01:16:05.372
Ow!

01:16:05.494 --> 01:16:06.802
It's Gary.
It's Gary.

01:16:09.865 --> 01:16:12.133
The whole town's
out looking for us.

01:16:12.134 --> 01:16:15.172
That's a good thing. If everybody's
outside, that means nobody's inside.

01:16:15.571 --> 01:16:17.642
Gary, wait! Fuck!

01:16:20.576 --> 01:16:23.411
Gary, Gary! What do
you mean "nobody's inside"?

01:16:23.412 --> 01:16:24.846
I mean we can still do this!

01:16:24.847 --> 01:16:26.014
Do what exactly?

01:16:26.015 --> 01:16:27.615
Oh, we're still on the crawl.

01:16:30.519 --> 01:16:31.759
"King Gay".

01:16:31.987 --> 01:16:33.227
Peter?

01:16:34.290 --> 01:16:35.496
Peter.

01:16:38.194 --> 01:16:41.641
I thought that was you.
Are you okay?

01:16:42.131 --> 01:16:43.667
Am I what?

01:16:44.200 --> 01:16:46.868
I know we didn't see
eye to eye at school.

01:16:46.869 --> 01:16:49.076
Goodness knows I regret that.

01:16:49.672 --> 01:16:51.406
I wanted to say something
back at the pub,

01:16:51.407 --> 01:16:54.354
but I felt so terribly
ashamed by what I'd done.

01:16:54.944 --> 01:16:58.653
Let me make it up to you, Peter.
Please.

01:17:01.951 --> 01:17:04.119
Gary, you're out of your mind!
We've come too far.

01:17:04.120 --> 01:17:05.186
It's fucking suicide.

01:17:05.187 --> 01:17:09.023
I know. We are going to get to
The World's End if it kills us.

01:17:09.024 --> 01:17:10.825
Where's Pete?

01:17:10.826 --> 01:17:12.567
I hate you!

01:17:12.761 --> 01:17:15.401
You fucking bastard!
I hate you!

01:17:15.664 --> 01:17:18.833
Pete! Leave it! Why are
you doing this, Peter?

01:17:18.834 --> 01:17:19.972
We don't want to hurt you.

01:17:21.036 --> 01:17:22.709
Come on, mate!
It's not worth it!

01:17:23.239 --> 01:17:25.048
Yes, it fucking is!

01:17:26.609 --> 01:17:27.587
What's he doing?

01:17:28.277 --> 01:17:29.415
Oh, shit.

01:17:30.312 --> 01:17:31.313
Peter...

01:17:33.415 --> 01:17:34.393
Peter...

01:17:35.451 --> 01:17:39.729
I must say, I'm very
disappointed in you, Peter.

01:17:44.026 --> 01:17:46.028
I'll punch their
fucking lights out.

01:17:46.128 --> 01:17:47.808
Andy! No, no, no,
there's too many of them.

01:17:55.437 --> 01:17:56.438
Pete.

01:18:08.150 --> 01:18:09.151
Peter.

01:18:09.251 --> 01:18:10.752
We gotta go.
Gary's right.

01:18:10.753 --> 01:18:12.587
We gotta get to The King's Head.
Exactly.

01:18:12.588 --> 01:18:13.726
What?

01:18:14.957 --> 01:18:17.759
We are not going to The King's Head.
We're done.

01:18:17.760 --> 01:18:19.727
We're going to do what we should
have done in the first place.

01:18:19.728 --> 01:18:21.049
Get The Beast and
get out of here.

01:18:21.330 --> 01:18:24.277
We are fucking leaving
and we are never coming back.

01:18:25.401 --> 01:18:27.235
Now, you can either
come with us willingly

01:18:27.236 --> 01:18:30.238
or I'm gonna knock you the fuck
out and carry you there myself.

01:18:30.239 --> 01:18:32.307
You choose.
All right. All right.

01:18:32.308 --> 01:18:36.044
Just think about what you're saying, you
know, because you have been drinking.

01:18:36.045 --> 01:18:37.046
You fuck.

01:18:54.730 --> 01:18:56.471
Shit, it's those fucking kids.

01:18:56.632 --> 01:18:58.134
Not them again.

01:19:02.972 --> 01:19:05.006
What the hell is that?

01:19:05.007 --> 01:19:07.487
I don't know, but it's
definitely not modern art.

01:19:17.319 --> 01:19:20.388
Oh, shit, we're trapped.
Where's The Beast?

01:19:20.389 --> 01:19:24.826
Okay, all right. We're here, so
The Beast is in the next street.

01:19:24.827 --> 01:19:25.994
How are we gonna get to it?

01:19:25.995 --> 01:19:27.996
We'll have to go through.
Through where?

01:19:27.997 --> 01:19:29.874
I don't fucking believe this.

01:19:31.567 --> 01:19:32.875
Number 10.

01:19:36.672 --> 01:19:37.673
Come on.

01:19:40.976 --> 01:19:41.954
Let's go.

01:19:42.511 --> 01:19:44.422
The backdoor, back door.
Let's go.

01:19:45.347 --> 01:19:46.348
Here we go.

01:19:49.518 --> 01:19:50.519
Okay, there it is.

01:19:51.320 --> 01:19:52.321
Shit.

01:19:54.189 --> 01:19:56.724
We wait for an opening, and
then we leg it to The Beast.

01:19:56.725 --> 01:19:58.329
We need the keys.

01:20:00.829 --> 01:20:02.035
Gary?

01:20:04.366 --> 01:20:06.573
Gary, what are you doing?

01:20:07.636 --> 01:20:09.370
Just a little toast.

01:20:09.371 --> 01:20:12.373
Gary, put the pint down, yeah?

01:20:12.374 --> 01:20:15.412
To Oliver, Pete.

01:20:16.612 --> 01:20:17.590
And to us.

01:20:18.347 --> 01:20:20.384
You know, 'cause
10 pubs isn't bad,

01:20:21.116 --> 01:20:24.563
It's not, but
we're calling time.

01:20:26.555 --> 01:20:27.556
Okay.

01:20:44.640 --> 01:20:45.914
So close.

01:20:47.910 --> 01:20:48.945
Number 10.

01:20:50.913 --> 01:20:51.914
Okay.

01:20:52.614 --> 01:20:53.888
So close.

01:20:59.288 --> 01:21:02.497
No, no, no, no,
no. Gary!

01:21:03.992 --> 01:21:05.593
Gary! Gary!

01:21:05.594 --> 01:21:08.006
Let him go.
He left you, man.

01:21:08.731 --> 01:21:09.766
I can't.

01:21:10.599 --> 01:21:11.600
Andy!

01:21:22.511 --> 01:21:24.650
Gary! Gary!

01:21:27.883 --> 01:21:30.625
Gary, come back! Come
back, you stupid bastard!

01:21:54.676 --> 01:21:55.916
Gary!

01:21:56.645 --> 01:21:58.955
Gary! Gary!

01:22:22.704 --> 01:22:24.372
Andy, look out!

01:22:41.256 --> 01:22:42.234
Come on!

01:22:44.193 --> 01:22:45.194
What the...

01:22:48.197 --> 01:22:50.473
Get in. Get in.

01:22:51.333 --> 01:22:53.711
Gary, Andy, get the fuck in!

01:22:54.069 --> 01:22:56.811
You heard him, Andy.
Get the fuck in.

01:22:57.005 --> 01:22:58.814
We haven't much time!

01:23:10.252 --> 01:23:12.823
Andy! Go, now!
Steven!

01:23:13.889 --> 01:23:15.027
Go!

01:23:35.010 --> 01:23:35.988
Andy.

01:23:37.846 --> 01:23:39.450
I want you inside me.

01:23:40.549 --> 01:23:41.550
Okay.

01:23:46.989 --> 01:23:47.990
Cheers.

01:24:08.410 --> 01:24:09.718
Ah!

01:24:10.245 --> 01:24:12.691
You've had enough!
This is The World's End, man!

01:24:12.814 --> 01:24:13.918
I know!

01:24:14.683 --> 01:24:15.684
Stop this!

01:24:17.386 --> 01:24:20.054
Leave me alone!
What do you care anyway?

01:24:20.055 --> 01:24:23.691
Of course I fucking care. There's
a reason I'm angry at you!

01:24:23.692 --> 01:24:25.726
I know why you're angry
at me, okay?

01:24:25.727 --> 01:24:28.230
But it's not my fault
that you crashed that car.

01:24:28.330 --> 01:24:31.311
That's not the point.
You let me down, man.

01:24:31.633 --> 01:24:34.477
You were Gary King.
Gary fucking King.

01:24:35.304 --> 01:24:39.173
I would have followed you to the end.
I fucking have!

01:24:39.174 --> 01:24:41.347
Then stop following me!

01:24:46.315 --> 01:24:49.091
No! It's just one more.

01:24:49.785 --> 01:24:51.594
Let me have this.

01:24:52.854 --> 01:24:54.655
You've got everything you want.

01:24:54.656 --> 01:24:56.090
What are you talking about?

01:24:56.091 --> 01:24:59.994
You've got your perfect job and your
perfect house and your perfect wife.

01:24:59.995 --> 01:25:01.406
You think it's so perfect?

01:25:04.199 --> 01:25:05.542
She left me, Gary.

01:25:06.134 --> 01:25:08.402
She took the kids to her
mum's three weeks ago,

01:25:08.403 --> 01:25:11.839
Said I'm not present enough.
I'm trying to win her back.

01:25:11.840 --> 01:25:13.474
And God knows I am losing.

01:25:13.475 --> 01:25:17.514
But I will continue to fight,
because that is how we survive.

01:25:18.714 --> 01:25:22.783
For fuck's sake, Gary, I just punched
my wedding ring out of a robot's tummy.

01:25:22.784 --> 01:25:24.986
Exactly! You fight for
what's important.

01:25:24.987 --> 01:25:27.054
But what is so important
about The Golden Mile?

01:25:27.055 --> 01:25:28.557
It's all I've got!

01:25:29.324 --> 01:25:30.428
Gary.

01:25:51.913 --> 01:25:53.085
You need help, Gary.

01:25:53.348 --> 01:25:56.795
I got help.
You know what help was?

01:25:57.919 --> 01:25:59.987
Help was a lot of people
sitting in a circle

01:25:59.988 --> 01:26:01.934
talking about how fucking
awful things had got.

01:26:02.557 --> 01:26:04.925
That is not my idea
of a good time.

01:26:04.926 --> 01:26:07.998
And this is? They told
me when to go to bed.

01:26:09.231 --> 01:26:10.232
Me!

01:26:11.033 --> 01:26:16.504
Gary, mate, how can you tell when
you're drunk if you're never sober?

01:26:16.505 --> 01:26:18.416
I don't wanna be sober.

01:26:19.841 --> 01:26:22.412
It never got better
than that night.

01:26:23.011 --> 01:26:24.931
That was supposed to be
the beginning of my life.

01:26:25.714 --> 01:26:28.593
All that promise
and fucking optimism.

01:26:28.917 --> 01:26:32.364
That feeling like we could
take on the whole universe.

01:26:33.055 --> 01:26:34.591
It was a big lie.

01:26:36.391 --> 01:26:38.526
Nothing happened.

01:26:38.527 --> 01:26:40.200
You don't need
to do this, Gary.

01:26:43.398 --> 01:26:44.604
Yeah, I do.

01:26:49.104 --> 01:26:50.640
<i>Please, stand by.</i>

01:26:52.708 --> 01:26:54.244
<i>Please, stand by.</i>

01:26:56.645 --> 01:26:58.283
<i>Please, stand by.</i>

01:27:00.515 --> 01:27:01.994
<i>Please, stand by.</i>

01:27:04.653 --> 01:27:05.631
Ah!

01:27:48.964 --> 01:27:50.364
What are you doing?

01:27:50.365 --> 01:27:52.038
No, don't go out there.

01:27:52.167 --> 01:27:54.841
<i>Gary King.</i>

01:27:55.971 --> 01:27:57.211
Yeah?

01:28:00.041 --> 01:28:02.885
<i>Gary King of the humans.</i>

01:28:03.245 --> 01:28:05.054
Yeah. What do you want?

01:28:05.413 --> 01:28:08.949
<i>We are here to enable
your full potential,</i>

01:28:08.950 --> 01:28:12.386
<i>as we have with countless
worlds across the galaxy.</i>

01:28:12.387 --> 01:28:14.958
Oh, yeah?
How'd you manage that, then?

01:28:15.090 --> 01:28:17.591
We appropriate a small
percentage of the population

01:28:17.592 --> 01:28:20.903
at 2,000 or so penetration
points across the planet.

01:28:21.196 --> 01:28:24.006
This ensures maximum coverage.

01:28:24.566 --> 01:28:30.037
From there, we create simulants
to spread our ideologies

01:28:30.038 --> 01:28:31.711
through peaceful
indoctrination.

01:28:32.374 --> 01:28:35.981
Our objective is simple,
to ready the population

01:28:36.111 --> 01:28:38.717
for participation in
our galactic community.

01:28:39.447 --> 01:28:43.293
This method requires
a small sacrifice.

01:28:43.451 --> 01:28:45.727
But the fewer
replacements we make,

01:28:45.854 --> 01:28:48.155
the more successful
we consider our operation.

01:28:48.156 --> 01:28:52.730
Of course, we welcome those
who volunteer themselves.

01:28:52.994 --> 01:28:57.773
We can offer attractive incentives
for those who willingly combine.

01:28:58.366 --> 01:29:01.643
The chance to be young again and
yet retain selected memories.

01:29:02.804 --> 01:29:05.148
Isn't that something
you'd like?

01:29:06.041 --> 01:29:08.419
Something you've always wanted?

01:29:17.919 --> 01:29:21.162
Oh, my God! I'm so cute!

01:29:22.123 --> 01:29:25.730
The beauty of our system
is that we all win.

01:29:25.961 --> 01:29:28.168
There are no losers.

01:29:31.433 --> 01:29:34.107
Allow me to carry
your legend forward.

01:29:34.970 --> 01:29:38.713
Let the man you have become
be the boy you were.

01:29:48.083 --> 01:29:49.960
Nah.

01:29:51.052 --> 01:29:52.998
There's only one Gary King.

01:29:54.990 --> 01:30:00.463
<i>Then you have made your choice,
Gary King of the humans.</i>

01:30:00.829 --> 01:30:02.329
Yeah, I have.

01:30:02.330 --> 01:30:07.334
Because frankly, who the fuck are you to
come down here and tell us what to do?

01:30:07.335 --> 01:30:11.839
<i>We are The Network and we are
here for your betterment.</i>

01:30:11.840 --> 01:30:13.307
<i>In the last 23 years,</i>

01:30:13.308 --> 01:30:16.289
<i>have you not marveled as information
technology has surged forward?</i>

01:30:16.444 --> 01:30:17.845
No.

01:30:17.846 --> 01:30:22.116
<i>Earth has grown smaller yet greater
as connectivity has grown.</i>

01:30:22.117 --> 01:30:25.719
<i>This is our doing and it
is just the beginning.</i>

01:30:25.720 --> 01:30:28.223
Oh, fuck off, you big lamp.

01:30:28.490 --> 01:30:31.699
<i>You are children
and you require guidance.</i>

01:30:32.193 --> 01:30:33.831
<i>There is no room
for imperfection.</i>

01:30:34.162 --> 01:30:37.837
Hey, Earth isn't perfect, all right?
And humans aren't perfect.

01:30:37.999 --> 01:30:40.377
And guess what?
I ain't perfect.

01:30:40.602 --> 01:30:43.837
<i>And therein lies the necessity
for this intervention.</i>

01:30:43.838 --> 01:30:48.442
<i>Must the galaxy be subjected to an
entire planet of people like you?</i>

01:30:48.443 --> 01:30:51.686
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

01:30:51.913 --> 01:30:54.114
Who put you in charge, huh?

01:30:54.115 --> 01:30:56.425
Who are you to
criticize anyone?

01:30:56.685 --> 01:30:58.892
Now, you might think
Gary's a bit of a cock,

01:30:59.487 --> 01:31:02.798
and he is a bit of a cock,
but he's my cock.

01:31:02.924 --> 01:31:04.358
Oh, thanks, man.

01:31:04.359 --> 01:31:09.063
<i>But he is a detriment to himself, just
as Earth is a detriment to the galaxy.</i>

01:31:09.064 --> 01:31:10.197
What did you say?

01:31:10.198 --> 01:31:14.169
<i>You act out the same cycles of
self-destruction again and again.</i>

01:31:14.269 --> 01:31:19.241
<i>At this point your planet is the least
civilized in the entire galaxy.</i>

01:31:19.474 --> 01:31:22.250
What did he say? He's saying
we're a bunch of fuck-ups.

01:31:22.510 --> 01:31:25.980
Hey, it's our basic human
right to be fuck-ups.

01:31:26.081 --> 01:31:30.154
This civilization was founded on fuck-ups.
And you know what?

01:31:30.285 --> 01:31:32.753
That makes me proud.
And me!

01:31:32.754 --> 01:31:35.530
What is it they say?
"To err is..."

01:31:36.091 --> 01:31:37.157
"To err is human."

01:31:37.158 --> 01:31:40.696
"To err is human," so, uh...

01:31:41.763 --> 01:31:44.631
<i>We do not believe you
speak for all humanity.</i>

01:31:44.632 --> 01:31:47.768
<i>You are but two men.
Two drunk men.</i>

01:31:47.769 --> 01:31:49.442
Three drunk men!

01:31:50.605 --> 01:31:52.506
Stevie-baby!

01:31:54.476 --> 01:31:57.923
<i>Enough! Enough, humans!</i>

01:31:58.546 --> 01:32:03.450
Oh, you are in trouble now. It's
only the fucking Three Musketeers.

01:32:03.451 --> 01:32:07.388
<i>You are revolting against the
wisdom of countless solar systems.</i>

01:32:07.389 --> 01:32:08.834
Yeah, we are revolting!

01:32:09.524 --> 01:32:12.630
You just said you're not here to conquer.
Can I just ask,

01:32:12.794 --> 01:32:15.638
how many people did you have
to replace in Newton Haven?

01:32:15.797 --> 01:32:17.470
<i>That is irrelevant.</i>
Is it?

01:32:17.966 --> 01:32:21.880
Hands up.
Who here is human?

01:32:23.371 --> 01:32:24.907
I'm human.
One!

01:32:25.907 --> 01:32:27.682
And me.
That's two.

01:32:28.109 --> 01:32:30.277
I am. But don't
know for how long.

01:32:30.278 --> 01:32:31.845
Basil!
Shh...

01:32:31.846 --> 01:32:35.649
So what's that? Three?
You had to replace an entire town?

01:32:35.650 --> 01:32:36.950
<i>Not the entire town.</i>

01:32:36.951 --> 01:32:40.320
Everybody apart from old
Nutbowl and the Shifty twins.

01:32:40.321 --> 01:32:42.356
That's a good name for a band, Gary.
You should write that down.

01:32:42.357 --> 01:32:44.425
I will. What about the
ones you replaced,

01:32:44.426 --> 01:32:45.959
like Peter and Oliver?

01:32:45.960 --> 01:32:48.328
Yeah, what happened
to the empties?

01:32:48.329 --> 01:32:50.240
I told you not to ask that!

01:32:50.398 --> 01:32:53.902
<i>Redundant vessels are recycled, mulched
and converted into fertilizer,</i>

01:32:54.002 --> 01:32:57.471
<i>whereupon they are returned to the
earth to promote verdancy and growth.</i>

01:32:57.472 --> 01:33:00.207
<i>It is a highly efficient
means of organic renewal.</i>

01:33:00.208 --> 01:33:01.508
Mulched?

01:33:01.509 --> 01:33:03.911
<i>It is a relative few in light
of our long-term plan.</i>

01:33:03.912 --> 01:33:07.247
You mean a few hundred thousand
turned to fucking compost?

01:33:07.248 --> 01:33:09.583
What about the other places?
The penetration points.

01:33:10.718 --> 01:33:12.686
Are they as successful
as Newton Haven?

01:33:12.687 --> 01:33:15.689
Because I'm guessing we're not
the only glitch in your system.

01:33:15.690 --> 01:33:19.160
<i>It is true, The Network has been
experiencing some difficulties.</i>

01:33:19.294 --> 01:33:22.763
I think you bit off more than
you can chew with Earth, mate.

01:33:22.764 --> 01:33:25.040
Yeah, 'cause we are more
belligerent, more stubborn

01:33:25.166 --> 01:33:27.468
and more idiotic
than you can possibly imagine,

01:33:27.469 --> 01:33:29.436
and I am not just
talking about Gary.

01:33:29.437 --> 01:33:31.105
Yeah, there's more
than one Gary King.

01:33:31.106 --> 01:33:34.053
<i>But you said...</i>
I fucking know what I fucking said!

01:33:34.209 --> 01:33:38.345
<i>Your reliance on profanity is a measure of
your immaturity as a man and a species,</i>

01:33:38.346 --> 01:33:42.590
Why don't you just get in your rocket and
fuck off back to Legoland, you cunts!

01:33:42.717 --> 01:33:46.520
Yeah! Stop fucking
Starbucking us, man! Yeah!

01:33:46.521 --> 01:33:48.288
<i>It is our duty
to challenge you.</i>

01:33:48.289 --> 01:33:51.125
Just leave us to our own devices,
you intergalactic arseholes.

01:33:51.126 --> 01:33:52.726
<i>You misunderstand.</i>
Shut up!

01:33:52.727 --> 01:33:54.595
<i>We are trying...</i>
Nobody's listening!

01:33:54.596 --> 01:33:55.662
<i>If you'd only...</i>

01:33:55.663 --> 01:34:00.874
Face it, we are the human race and
we don't like being told what to do.

01:34:03.238 --> 01:34:05.309
<i>Just what is it
that you want to do?</i>

01:34:06.241 --> 01:34:08.408
We want to be free!
Yeah.

01:34:08.409 --> 01:34:10.511
We want to be free to
do what we want to do!

01:34:10.512 --> 01:34:11.513
Yeah.

01:34:11.613 --> 01:34:13.280
We want to get loaded.
Yeah.

01:34:13.281 --> 01:34:15.249
And we want to
have a good time.

01:34:15.250 --> 01:34:17.526
And that's what
we're going to do.

01:34:18.553 --> 01:34:21.088
<i>It is pointless
arguing with you.</i>

01:34:21.089 --> 01:34:24.127
<i>You will be left to
your own devices.</i>

01:34:24.292 --> 01:34:25.862
Really?

01:34:25.994 --> 01:34:27.064
<i>Yeah.</i>

01:34:27.762 --> 01:34:28.763
<i>Fuck if.</i>

01:34:38.439 --> 01:34:41.079
They fucked off.

01:34:44.846 --> 01:34:49.295
Yeah, yeah, yeah!
Up yours! Up yours! Up yours!

01:34:49.584 --> 01:34:53.387
Yeah, we did it!
We won, we won!

01:34:57.225 --> 01:34:59.136
Gary, let's Boo-Boo.

01:35:02.931 --> 01:35:04.433
Yeah, it's shit here, innit?

01:35:07.135 --> 01:35:09.445
Oi, up here!

01:35:09.871 --> 01:35:10.872
Go!

01:35:14.075 --> 01:35:15.076
Get up.

01:35:15.577 --> 01:35:16.555
Come on!

01:35:32.794 --> 01:35:34.432
Well done.

01:35:34.629 --> 01:35:37.064
Thanks a bunch. Had to go
and spoil it, didn't you?

01:35:37.065 --> 01:35:39.011
Yeah, happy now?

01:35:39.834 --> 01:35:41.404
Basil, what do we do now?

01:35:41.836 --> 01:35:43.570
Same as before.

01:35:43.571 --> 01:35:45.380
Go!

01:35:49.677 --> 01:35:50.849
Where's The Beast?

01:35:51.946 --> 01:35:53.447
The Beast is dead, mate.

01:35:53.448 --> 01:35:56.783
You know what... You know
what's really annoying?

01:35:56.784 --> 01:35:57.851
What?

01:35:57.852 --> 01:36:00.526
I promised myself I
wouldn't die in this town.

01:36:02.357 --> 01:36:03.995
You're not gonna.

01:36:05.159 --> 01:36:07.160
I think our luck just changed.

01:36:07.161 --> 01:36:08.765
Whoo-hoo!

01:36:10.531 --> 01:36:11.509
Oh!

01:36:11.933 --> 01:36:13.000
Sorry!

01:36:13.001 --> 01:36:15.003
Sam?
Yes.

01:36:15.136 --> 01:36:16.436
You came back for us!

01:36:16.437 --> 01:36:19.281
Yes, I did. Well, I got lost
on the ring road. But, yes.

01:36:19.507 --> 01:36:23.243
Hi, Sam, could you give us
a lift to London, please?

01:36:23.244 --> 01:36:25.112
Did you find out what
happened to my brother?

01:36:25.113 --> 01:36:26.153
We'll tell you on the way.

01:36:28.116 --> 01:36:30.517
Sorry about the mess. I've
been meaning 10 clear that up.

01:36:30.518 --> 01:36:32.725
We forgive you. Let's go.
Which way?

01:36:33.588 --> 01:36:34.589
Backwards!

01:36:56.110 --> 01:36:57.453
Which way now?

01:36:58.146 --> 01:36:59.386
Go straight over!

01:37:17.765 --> 01:37:19.244
We can make it.

01:37:21.669 --> 01:37:22.739
We're gonna make it.

01:37:30.411 --> 01:37:31.754
We made it!

01:38:32.306 --> 01:38:33.808
I'm sorry.

01:38:37.478 --> 01:38:38.718
I know.

01:38:40.681 --> 01:38:41.887
I know.

01:38:42.316 --> 01:38:43.850
<i>Everyone remembers
where they were</i>

01:38:43.851 --> 01:38:46.024
<i>when the lights went out
on Planet Earth.</i>

01:38:46.154 --> 01:38:50.432
<i>Me, Gary, Steven and Sam, we were
standing right by the switch.</i>

01:38:51.559 --> 01:38:54.403
<i>I guess it was
a big night for everyone.</i>

01:38:55.029 --> 01:38:58.272
That morning gave a whole new
meaning to the word "hangover".

01:38:59.667 --> 01:39:03.638
We decided to walk it off,
all the way back to London,

01:39:04.505 --> 01:39:08.146
but the headache didn't end there.
It just went on and on.

01:39:09.877 --> 01:39:11.515
Talk about the Big Smoke.

01:39:13.214 --> 01:39:18.129
When The Network went down, it
triggered some kind of pulse,

01:39:19.854 --> 01:39:21.765
wiped out all our technology

01:39:23.724 --> 01:39:25.362
and sent us here,

01:39:27.161 --> 01:39:29.198
back to the Dark Ages.

01:39:30.398 --> 01:39:33.572
There were casualties, of course.
I knew a few of them.

01:39:34.001 --> 01:39:37.847
Some guy from work, my
cousin Paul, Gary's mum.

01:39:40.842 --> 01:39:43.243
Nobody really knew
how many we lost,

01:39:43.244 --> 01:39:45.912
because we never heard from
the rest of the world again.

01:39:45.913 --> 01:39:47.654
<i>Everyone got cut off.</i>

01:39:48.616 --> 01:39:51.256
<i>It isn't easy now,
but it is simpler.</i>

01:39:51.786 --> 01:39:54.254
<i>I'm back with the wife,
which is something.</i>

01:39:54.255 --> 01:39:58.291
<i>We decided our problems didn't seem
as bad in the grand scheme of things,</i>

01:39:58.292 --> 01:40:02.229
<i>We all had to go organic in a
big way, but if I'm honest,</i>

01:40:02.230 --> 01:40:05.837
<i>I'm hard pressed to recall any
processed foods I actually miss.</i>

01:40:09.770 --> 01:40:13.149
As for the blanks, well, a
funny thing happened there.

01:40:14.075 --> 01:40:15.554
They woke up.

01:40:15.910 --> 01:40:20.086
<i>A week or so after The Network pulled out,
they just sort of rebooted by themselves,</i>

01:40:21.082 --> 01:40:22.755
<i>tried to start afresh.</i>

01:40:24.352 --> 01:40:28.323
<i>They seemed lost at first, children
cut off from their parents,</i>

01:40:28.990 --> 01:40:33.666
<i>abandoned, forgotten, looking for guidance,
for someone to show them the way.</i>

01:40:34.829 --> 01:40:36.809
<i>I felt a bit sorry for them,
to be honest.</i>

01:40:38.566 --> 01:40:40.400
<i>The Network was right
about one thing.</i>

01:40:40.401 --> 01:40:42.779
<i>We can be a bit uncivilized.</i>

01:40:43.437 --> 01:40:47.112
<i>Maybe we would've been a bad
influence on the rest of the galaxy.</i>

01:40:47.975 --> 01:40:50.810
<i>Oliver went back to
being an estate agent.</i>

01:40:50.811 --> 01:40:53.113
<i>People still need a roof
over their heads,</i>

01:40:53.114 --> 01:40:55.492
<i>and the old Ollie always
had a gift for the gab.</i>

01:40:55.650 --> 01:40:58.785
<i>I guess the new one has, too.</i>

01:40:58.786 --> 01:41:00.493
<i>He's doing all right.</i>

01:41:01.455 --> 01:41:04.026
<i>I hear that the Peter found his
way home to Bishop's Gardens.</i>

01:41:04.358 --> 01:41:08.170
<i>I suppose he picked up
where the other one left off.</i>

01:41:09.163 --> 01:41:11.473
<i>I'm not sure his wife noticed.</i>

01:41:11.799 --> 01:41:16.077
<i>Maybe she chose not to. He's a
pretty good dad by all accounts.</i>

01:41:18.239 --> 01:41:21.074
<i>Steven and Sam got
together in the end.</i>

01:41:21.075 --> 01:41:23.043
<i>Didn't see that coming.</i>

01:41:23.044 --> 01:41:25.312
<i>They shacked up
just outside London.</i>

01:41:25.313 --> 01:41:27.589
<i>It's a pretty nice shack, too.</i>

01:41:28.049 --> 01:41:31.155
As for Gary? I don't know
what happened to Gary.

01:41:32.320 --> 01:41:35.301
We got separated and
I never saw him again.

01:41:36.390 --> 01:41:39.860
Some say he went back to Newton Haven.
I don't know why.

01:41:40.628 --> 01:41:42.630
I think his business
there was done.

01:41:43.831 --> 01:41:46.675
<i>It's funny, but I miss him.</i>

01:41:47.668 --> 01:41:51.514
<i>I wonder if he misses me.
Misses the boys.</i>

01:41:58.212 --> 01:42:00.692
<i>Wherever he is,
I hope he's happy.</i>

01:42:01.048 --> 01:42:03.083
<i>That's all he ever wanted,
really.</i>

01:42:03.084 --> 01:42:04.722
<i>To have a good time.</i>

01:42:05.319 --> 01:42:08.391
<i>I just hope he found it
beyond the bottom of a glass.</i>

01:42:09.557 --> 01:42:14.267
<i>Because real happiness, real friends,
those are things worth living for,</i>

01:42:15.997 --> 01:42:17.670
<i>worth fighting for.</i>

01:42:29.877 --> 01:42:31.254
Blank bastards.

01:42:34.715 --> 01:42:36.388
Fucking robots.

01:42:45.493 --> 01:42:47.063
Five waters, please.

01:42:49.397 --> 01:42:50.899
You can have one.

01:42:51.766 --> 01:42:53.667
But I ain't serving this scum.

01:42:53.668 --> 01:42:56.706
Well, I'm afraid it's all
for one and one for all.

01:42:56.904 --> 01:42:59.272
You see, my young friends
and I are on an adventure.

01:42:59.273 --> 01:43:02.942
A quest, if you will. And since we
find ourselves in need of refreshment,

01:43:02.943 --> 01:43:05.651
you, sir, have the honor
of drawing first blood.

01:43:06.814 --> 01:43:08.885
So, I'll ask you again,

01:43:09.283 --> 01:43:10.762
for the last time,

01:43:12.119 --> 01:43:15.191
five waters, please.

01:43:23.597 --> 01:43:26.043
Who the hell
do you think you are?

01:43:26.434 --> 01:43:30.280
Me? They call me The King.
