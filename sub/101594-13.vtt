experiencing the same pain

51:39.766 --> 51:42.247
and they're both missing
the same person.

51:42.291 --> 51:43.814
It's not too late.

51:48.471 --> 51:51.343
For either of us.

51:51.387 --> 51:53.389
For June,
reading this letter

51:53.432 --> 51:56.783
is about her accepting that
John is gone

51:56.827 --> 51:59.612
and starting the process of
truly grieving him.

51:59.656 --> 52:01.571
John: "This the hardest decision
of my life.

52:01.614 --> 52:03.703
One that I hope you can find
in your heart

52:03.747 --> 52:05.618
to forgive me
for making --"

52:05.662 --> 52:08.230
The reason she chooses to
read it out loud

52:08.273 --> 52:11.450
is because she knows
John Dorie, Sr.

52:11.494 --> 52:14.192
needs to go through that same
grieving process.

52:14.236 --> 52:18.544
"I believe
you'll forgive me one day.

52:18.588 --> 52:20.720
Same way I forgave Dad."

52:20.764 --> 52:25.116
John Dorie, Sr. hears that
in spite of abandoning his son,

52:25.160 --> 52:27.423
his son still found a way
to forgive him,

52:27.466 --> 52:30.208
and it really is kind of
all about that light

52:30.252 --> 52:34.038
that John Dorie just had in him
that people were drawn to,

52:34.081 --> 52:35.518
that optimism.

52:35.561 --> 52:38.999
"You are the most amazing woman
I've ever known."

52:39.043 --> 52:42.002
♪♪

52:42.046 --> 52:44.309
"You rekindled
the light in me, June."

52:44.353 --> 52:46.572
Once again, it kind of gets
reignited,

52:46.616 --> 52:48.226
and John Dorie, Sr.
gets reignited

52:48.270 --> 52:50.141
and June, and those are kind of
the two characters

52:50.185 --> 52:52.491
who are gonna carry
John Dorie forward

52:52.535 --> 52:55.625
in their spirit going into the
future of the show.

52:55.668 --> 52:59.237
Morgan, there's someone
I'd like you to meet.

52:59.281 --> 53:00.717
June:
This is John Dorie.

53:00.760 --> 53:02.458
It's John's father.

53:02.501 --> 53:06.940
This episode really was about
saying goodbye to John Dorie

53:06.984 --> 53:09.552
in a way that hopefully brings
catharsis for the characters

53:09.595 --> 53:11.380
and for the audience,

53:11.423 --> 53:15.122
and we really wanted the end of
this episode just to feel like

53:15.166 --> 53:17.342
a proper send-off to him
and it was honoring

53:17.386 --> 53:19.126
the spirit of who
John Dorie was,

53:19.170 --> 53:21.041
the spirit of what the character
brought to the show.

53:21.085 --> 53:23.261
Thank you for letting me
come stay a while.

53:23.305 --> 53:25.132
Well, you're a welcome addition,
Mr. Dorie.

53:25.176 --> 53:26.917
The man
we're looking for,

53:26.960 --> 53:29.267
the one who sent those people
who attacked you and Grace --

53:29.311 --> 53:31.617
John's father knows
everything about him.

53:31.661 --> 53:35.099
There is a little bit of a hint
about what's to come

53:35.142 --> 53:37.319
in terms of the kind of
growing conflict.

53:37.362 --> 53:40.147
But yeah, we wanted to have an
uplifting ending

53:40.191 --> 53:41.540
for once this season.

53:41.584 --> 53:43.890
If he's doing now
what he wanted to do before,

53:43.934 --> 53:46.806
he's not gonna stop
'til we're all dead.
