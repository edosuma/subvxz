I'm my stepmom Brenda.

18:37.825 --> 18:39.827
- Newt, you didn't
break us up.

18:39.910 --> 18:41.745
We did.
- Yeah.

18:41.829 --> 18:43.705
I think it's been
coming along for a while.

18:43.789 --> 18:45.707
But neither of us
wanted to admit it.

18:45.791 --> 18:46.792
- Well, I know I didn't.

18:46.875 --> 18:49.211
I wanted to break up,

18:49.294 --> 18:51.213
but I was afraid of
losing you as a friend.

18:51.296 --> 18:52.297
- Sawyer, we'll
always be friends.

18:52.381 --> 18:55.300
But maybe we'd be better
off not being a couple.

18:55.384 --> 18:58.345
- So, are you still coming
to my goat's birthday party?

18:58.428 --> 19:00.430
- Well, yeah.
I already bought her a gift.

19:00.514 --> 19:01.890
- Oh?

19:01.974 --> 19:03.976
- I'm I've ruined
the night, Asha.

19:04.059 --> 19:05.978
- You didn't ruin anything.

19:06.061 --> 19:07.938
This is way more fun than
staying home studying.

19:08.021 --> 19:11.191
Plus, you looked so manly
while pushing the limo.

he was going to ask me.

So when you asked me to go
as a friend, I said yes.

But then Charlie did ask me,
so, I called you,

19:44.433 --> 19:47.436
I thought I could get out of it

to ruin Homecoming.

Bella's not out here.

own her on the field.

Anyway, uh, enjoy the rest
of your night, Bella.

I'm on it.
