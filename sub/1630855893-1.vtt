WEBVTT

00:22.856 --> 00:23.857
She's here.

00:39.998 --> 00:43.001
Hey, ladies. I'm sorry.
The audience is full for today.

00:43.877 --> 00:45.087
Please come back tomorrow.

00:48.757 --> 00:51.009
- Baking dish?
- The left holds more heat.

00:51.885 --> 00:53.345
Live in two. I need you in the chair.

00:53.345 --> 00:54.888
Did you get the sodium chloride?

00:54.888 --> 00:57.015
- Of course.
- Roma or San Marzano?

00:57.641 --> 00:59.184
Roma. Thank you, James.

01:00.060 --> 01:01.520
You never answered my question

01:01.520 --> 01:04.022
about the Presto sponsorship.
And I know how you feel about--

01:04.022 --> 01:06.108
I will start the show with it, Walter.

01:06.108 --> 01:08.068
Really? You're not just saying that?

01:08.068 --> 01:09.987
Oh, good Lord. Thank you.

01:10.571 --> 01:11.738
Cans are on the counter.

01:11.738 --> 01:15.033
Don't forget to smile from time to time.
Have a great show. Bye.

01:17.244 --> 01:20.455
- What kind of salt did she want?
- Uniodized. I went with kosher.

01:24.710 --> 01:27.379
It's all gotta be perfect. Labels out.

01:29.548 --> 01:30.799
It's all in the cue cards.

01:30.799 --> 01:32.467
- Don't worry, Walter.
- She's got it.

01:32.467 --> 01:35.137
Welcome, ladies.
The show's about to start.

01:35.137 --> 01:38.473
Big smiles. Energy. Happy.

01:39.141 --> 01:41.143
Energy. Big smiles. All of you.

01:41.643 --> 01:43.353
And rolling.

01:43.353 --> 01:46.523
We're live in five, four, three...

01:49.151 --> 01:50.152
Welcome, viewers.

01:50.152 --> 01:53.906
My name is Elizabeth Zott,
and this is <i>Supper at Six</i>.

01:57.201 --> 01:58.202
See this?

02:01.622 --> 02:04.833
Presto Soups.
Cooks so quick, it's done in a presto.

02:05.918 --> 02:08.336
- That's my line.
- <i>It is a real time-saver.</i>

02:08.336 --> 02:11.381
And that's because it's full of chemicals.
And not the good kind.

02:12.424 --> 02:14.134
There will be a surprise indeed.

02:14.134 --> 02:16.220
Feed enough of it to your loved ones,
and they'll die off,

02:16.220 --> 02:17.721
saving you tons of time

02:17.721 --> 02:19.348
because you won't have
to feed them anymore.

02:23.268 --> 02:26.146
Today
we will be making a fan-favorite, lasagna,

02:26.146 --> 02:28.398
but we will be testing a new variable.

02:32.027 --> 02:34.112
<i>Caring for loved ones takes work.</i>

02:34.655 --> 02:35.739
<i>Real work.</i>

02:35.739 --> 02:37.699
<i>Anyone who tells you differently
does not cook dinner</i>

02:37.699 --> 02:39.451
<i>for a family of five every night.</i>

02:40.035 --> 02:43.497
<i>So let's make something hearty.
Let's make something delicious.</i>

02:43.497 --> 02:45.958
<i>Let's make something
that keeps our family alive</i>

02:45.958 --> 02:47.751
<i>and gives us leftovers for a week.</i>

02:48.627 --> 02:50.128
Let's get started, shall we?

05:13.230 --> 05:16.400
Miss Zott?

05:16.400 --> 05:17.818
Good morning, Miss Frask.

05:17.818 --> 05:20.571
I hope you'll sign up
for the Little Miss Hastings Pageant.

05:20.571 --> 05:22.698
You know,
your lab is in between secretaries,

05:22.698 --> 05:24.575
and your fellas really could use
a contestant.

05:24.575 --> 05:25.868
I am not a secretary.

05:27.119 --> 05:29.288
Well, you know,
lab techs can participate too.

05:29.288 --> 05:30.873
It's any female support staff.

05:30.873 --> 05:33.542
Thank you,
but pageants are not my idea of fun.

05:34.626 --> 05:36.253
What is?

05:36.920 --> 05:39.715
Well, I have recently
become fascinated by archaebacteria,

05:39.715 --> 05:43.385
whose cell membranes are ether-link
foster lipids as opposed to bacteria,

05:43.385 --> 05:45.846
whose cell membrane are
ester-link foster lipids.

05:46.346 --> 05:47.347
I also like to cook.

05:48.307 --> 05:50.100
Let me know if you change your mind.

05:50.100 --> 05:51.185
I won't, but thank you.

05:51.185 --> 05:52.603
Now, if you don't mind,

05:52.603 --> 05:54.688
I have a lot to clean up
before the chemists arrive.

05:55.230 --> 05:56.815
I'm gonna put you down as a "maybe."

06:22.382 --> 06:23.509
I'm not to be disturbed!

06:23.509 --> 06:26.053
Dr. Evans? It's Dr. Donatti.

06:29.097 --> 06:30.098
One minute.

06:33.894 --> 06:35.229
You're not dressed.

06:35.896 --> 06:38.190
Well, in some cultures,
I would be considered overdressed.

06:39.358 --> 06:41.109
You missed
our monthly board meeting again.

06:42.528 --> 06:43.654
Because I've been hard at work.

06:44.154 --> 06:46.448
Everyone is anxiously awaiting
your results.

06:46.448 --> 06:48.033
And everyone will have to wait.

06:48.534 --> 06:50.911
You will be ready to submit your proposal

06:50.911 --> 06:53.080
for the Remsen Foundation grant, right?

06:53.080 --> 06:56.124
Because those grants keep
the lights on around here.

06:56.124 --> 06:58.418
I can think of a few lights
that would be best left off.

06:58.418 --> 07:00.921
Now, if you and your foot
will please excuse me.

07:01.922 --> 07:04.550
You do understand
that I'm your boss, right?

07:05.425 --> 07:06.426
Fire me.

07:09.471 --> 07:11.056
Honey, can you clean this up for me?

07:11.056 --> 07:12.850
And bring me those beakers I asked for?

07:13.767 --> 07:15.727
And, sweetheart,
I could use another cup of joe

07:15.727 --> 07:16.937
when you're done with that.

07:16.937 --> 07:19.398
It'll be a few minutes.
You could go to the cafeteria.

07:19.398 --> 07:21.525
But it's not your special beaker brew.

07:22.359 --> 07:24.653
- Zott?
- Yes, Dr. Powers?

07:25.153 --> 07:27.447
I've run it three times.
What am I missing?

07:27.447 --> 07:30.909
You're not seeing conversion
of the carbonyl group into an imine group.

07:30.909 --> 07:32.286
Right, I just--

07:32.828 --> 07:34.454
You forgot the acid catalyst.

07:35.873 --> 07:37.124
Thanks. I got it.

07:37.124 --> 07:39.126
Gentlemen, can you believe this shit?

07:40.169 --> 07:41.211
I don't get it.

07:41.211 --> 07:43.213
What does Evans have
that any of us don't have?

07:43.213 --> 07:45.465
He's a shoo-in for the Nobel.

07:45.465 --> 07:47.467
The Nobel Prize is overrated.

07:47.467 --> 07:51.221
It says, "Calvin Evans is
the Richard Feynman of chemistry."

07:51.221 --> 07:53.307
Doesn't give him an excuse
to hoard all our supplies.

07:53.307 --> 07:55.434
How much ribose does one guy need?

07:56.393 --> 07:57.978
Well, Evans better watch his back

07:57.978 --> 08:01.440
because young Boryweitz is coming
for his grant this year.

08:01.440 --> 08:03.108
Good luck with that, buddy.

08:03.108 --> 08:05.777
Looks like it's a rip-off
of Vauquelin's research.

08:05.777 --> 08:08.405
- I'm building on his work.
- An homage.

08:08.405 --> 08:10.073
From 1806.

08:11.241 --> 08:12.993
Hand to God,
you got a better chance of winning

08:12.993 --> 08:14.578
the Little Miss Hastings Pageant.

08:16.622 --> 08:18.415
- Right.
- Well, that is unless

08:18.415 --> 08:22.628
- Zott here decides to enter. Huh, boys?
- Come on, sweetie.

08:23.921 --> 08:24.922
Was it something I said?

08:43.482 --> 08:45.567
- So I said to Robert--
- Fran now calls him Robert.

08:45.567 --> 08:47.694
I said to Dr. Donatti that, you know,

08:47.694 --> 08:51.073
this pageant needs to be sophisticated,
needs to be elevated. It needs pizzazz.

08:51.073 --> 08:52.533
What it needs is an open bar.

08:53.033 --> 08:55.035
- I'm not a miracle worker.
- Yes, you are.

08:55.035 --> 08:56.537
Well, you know what? I might be.

08:56.537 --> 08:59.456
Because, I'm excited to say that he agreed

08:59.456 --> 09:00.874
to an evening gown category,

09:00.874 --> 09:04.044
before talent and swimsuit,
and a cash prize.

09:06.004 --> 09:08.924
Every day. Dr. Evans and his bag of nuts.

09:08.924 --> 09:10.551
How can any man survive on that?

09:10.551 --> 09:12.052
And he runs.

09:12.052 --> 09:13.136
Runs where?

09:13.971 --> 09:16.557
He just runs to run. He's very peculiar.

09:16.557 --> 09:18.642
And he never talks to anyone.

09:38.245 --> 09:42.541
Hey. Donatti put a freeze on overtime.
So don't stay too late, or it's my tail.

09:42.541 --> 09:44.376
- I'm right behind you.
- Okay.

10:17.284 --> 10:18.285
Shit.

12:02.723 --> 12:08.145
Miss Zott, I supervise over a hundred
of the country's finest chemists,

12:08.145 --> 12:10.898
who in turn generate groundbreaking work.

12:11.773 --> 12:15.485
They use equipment worth thousands
of dollars to generate said work.

12:15.485 --> 12:19.865
And so when I hear that a lab tech
is using our equipment

12:19.865 --> 12:24.870
after hours without proper supervision,
it gives me pause.

12:25.746 --> 12:29.499
Sir, I can explain. I have my master's
in chemistry from UCLA,

12:29.499 --> 12:32.628
where I studied cellular metabolism
of nucleic acids.

12:32.628 --> 12:37.466
With all that said, I have been working
in my off-hours, never on the clock,

12:37.466 --> 12:39.718
conducting my own experiments
on abiogenesis.

12:39.718 --> 12:45.224
I am synthesizing simple, small molecules
into nucleotides and nucleic acids.

12:45.224 --> 12:48.477
My research is very promising,
and I intend to submit for the Remsen.

12:49.228 --> 12:52.397
Young lady, setting aside the fact
that you're using lab equipment

12:52.397 --> 12:54.399
without proper supervision of a chemist--

12:54.399 --> 12:55.692
I am a chemist.

12:55.692 --> 12:57.653
Our chemists have PhDs.

12:58.695 --> 13:01.823
I could never put the Hastings name
on the submission of a lab tech

13:01.823 --> 13:05.160
that's proudly waving around
her master's from UCLA.

13:05.160 --> 13:07.037
- I was top of my class...
- Miss Zott--

13:07.037 --> 13:08.539
...and the work will speak for itself.

13:08.539 --> 13:10.332
You are just not smart enough.

13:12.876 --> 13:14.545
Miss Zott, I wasn't finished.

13:15.045 --> 13:17.589
What's this I hear
about you not participating

13:17.589 --> 13:19.299
in the Little Miss Hastings Pageant?

13:19.883 --> 13:21.635
I wasn't aware that it was compulsory.

13:21.635 --> 13:23.095
It is not compulsory.

13:23.887 --> 13:25.848
It is part of the culture here.

13:26.890 --> 13:29.017
I would suggest that you find yourself

13:29.017 --> 13:31.019
a little more of the Hastings spirit,

13:31.019 --> 13:32.938
if you'd like
to keep your employment here.

13:34.648 --> 13:35.691
Now you may go.

13:41.154 --> 13:43.115
A smile once in a while wouldn't kill you.

13:47.369 --> 13:48.370
Miss Zott.

13:51.540 --> 13:52.666
Miss Zott?

13:52.666 --> 13:54.543
I hear you're joining us for the pageant.

13:54.543 --> 13:57.212
- How did you--
- So glad you had a change of heart.

13:57.212 --> 13:59.173
So I don't know if you've heard,

13:59.173 --> 14:01.675
but there's an evening gown category
this year.

14:01.675 --> 14:04.178
And also bikinis aren't mandatory.

14:04.178 --> 14:07.347
Feel free to wear a one-piece,
if that makes you feel more comfortable.

14:07.347 --> 14:09.600
Is now a good time for a photo?

14:10.100 --> 14:11.310
Smile.

14:16.857 --> 14:20.777
There she is. The thief.

14:21.278 --> 14:22.446
I beg your pardon?

14:23.739 --> 14:27.451
I have been through every department,
interrogated dozens of chemists--

14:27.451 --> 14:29.536
including ones from this very lab--

14:29.536 --> 14:33.540
who said that you, Miss Zott,
have a history of ruffling feathers.

14:34.041 --> 14:35.209
And perhaps more relevant,

14:35.209 --> 14:37.544
have an arrogant attitude
of self-importance.

14:37.544 --> 14:38.879
Have you heard yourself speak?

14:38.879 --> 14:40.714
So you don't deny it?

14:41.590 --> 14:43.425
What would a secretary even have
to do with ribose

14:43.425 --> 14:45.093
aside from sell it on the black market?

14:45.677 --> 14:49.806
- I am a chemist.
- And a fibber to boot.

14:50.849 --> 14:54.019
Oh, yes. Because there's such high demand
on the black market for monosaccharide!

14:54.019 --> 14:57.564
This is very disappointing!
Very-- I'm disappointed.

14:59.274 --> 15:01.235
One: My lab was unlocked last night,

15:01.235 --> 15:05.072
so I want someone to speak to janitorial
and have new locks placed on the door.

15:05.072 --> 15:08.075
Two: I have calculated the cost
of the missing ribose,

15:08.784 --> 15:11.245
and I wanna make it clear,
that will not be coming out of my budget.

15:11.245 --> 15:13.455
Three: I want my floors sterilized.

15:13.455 --> 15:16.166
At least one person entered
without my authorization.

15:16.166 --> 15:19.753
And with my allergies, I cannot risk
any contaminants. You understand?

15:19.753 --> 15:21.213
I'll take care of it, Dr. Evans.

15:21.213 --> 15:24.174
And lastly, I would like the secretary
responsible held accountable.

15:24.174 --> 15:25.467
I'll have her fired.

15:26.051 --> 15:28.804
Well,
just a formal reprimand will suffice.

15:28.804 --> 15:32.224
I'm shocked that it was one
of my secretaries, honestly.

15:32.224 --> 15:34.268
You said it was in the aminos lab?

15:34.268 --> 15:35.602
So that's Mary Ann Rogers.

15:35.602 --> 15:36.728
No.

15:36.728 --> 15:38.397
Her name was Elizabeth Zott.

15:39.690 --> 15:41.608
She's not a secretary. She's a lab tech.

15:42.693 --> 15:44.820
Miss Zott should know better.
She has her master's.

15:44.820 --> 15:47.447
- Her master's? In what?
- Chemistry.

15:50.284 --> 15:52.703
Will you be joining us for the
Little Miss Hastings Pageant this year?

15:52.703 --> 15:55.539
'Cause it would mean a lot
to company morale to see you there.

16:30.532 --> 16:33.827
Evans? Did not expect to see you here.

16:33.827 --> 16:35.871
- Right.
- It's like seeing Halley's Comet.

16:35.871 --> 16:37.831
Come have a drink
with me and the fellas, huh?

16:37.831 --> 16:39.124
Or no one will believe me.

16:39.750 --> 16:43.462
- What's your poison?
- Cyanide or aflatoxin.

16:44.963 --> 16:46.256
You're too much, huh?

16:46.256 --> 16:48.133
Boys, say hi to the guy right here.

16:48.133 --> 16:50.469
- The man, the myth, the legend.
- Anthony Powers. Hi.

16:50.469 --> 16:52.679
Mr. Remsen himself, I guess, huh?

16:53.263 --> 16:54.973
What are you working on right now?

16:55.641 --> 16:58.810
Elizabeth. Hi. There you are.

16:58.810 --> 17:02.773
Come follow me.
Come stand with us pageant girls.

17:02.773 --> 17:04.191
- You look great.
- Thank you.

17:04.191 --> 17:06.984
It took me forever to get ready today.

17:06.984 --> 17:08.987
- Girls, Elizabeth's here.
- Hello.

17:10.280 --> 17:13.617
I'll be right back. The Swedish meatballs
are running a bit low.

17:13.617 --> 17:14.742
They're a real hit.

17:16.453 --> 17:17.829
Fran did such a great job.

17:17.829 --> 17:19.122
So great.

17:19.915 --> 17:22.000
I love your scent. What is that?

17:22.709 --> 17:25.753
Black currant berries
with floral tones of roses.

17:25.753 --> 17:28.464
I'm a classic kind of girl. Chanel No. 5.

17:29.216 --> 17:30.634
Elizabeth, what scent do you wear?

17:31.510 --> 17:35.556
I don't. In the lab, your sense
of smell alerts you to potential dangers.

17:35.556 --> 17:38.350
And I'm already at a deficit due
to a hydrochloric acid accident

17:38.350 --> 17:39.685
when I was an undergrad.

17:39.685 --> 17:41.770
I singed most of the cilia in my nostrils,

17:41.770 --> 17:44.064
but thankfully they restored
themselves over time.

17:44.648 --> 17:46.233
So I'm not taking any more chances.

17:50.737 --> 17:52.155
Calvin Evans is here.

17:52.656 --> 17:54.032
You're sweet on him, aren't you?

17:54.616 --> 17:57.995
Smart, well-to-do, famous.
What's not to like?

18:00.122 --> 18:01.123
Try talking to him.

18:02.332 --> 18:06.003
Well, two more of these,
and I'm going to ask him to vote for me.

18:08.297 --> 18:09.298
Excuse me.

18:12.759 --> 18:14.178
I'm just gonna stand here with you.

18:15.596 --> 18:16.597
All right.

18:20.517 --> 18:22.686
You shouldn't let the other chemists
pick on you so much.

18:25.480 --> 18:26.899
It's just fellas being fellas.

18:28.108 --> 18:29.193
Male primate behavior.

18:29.693 --> 18:32.196
Please, everyone, take your seats.
Take your seats.

18:33.363 --> 18:35.782
Pageant contestants,
can I get you backstage?

18:36.325 --> 18:37.326
Thank you.

18:37.868 --> 18:40.579
Welcome. I'm Fran Frask...

18:40.579 --> 18:43.957
- Miss Zott, I have wanted to--
- ...acting head of Personnel.

18:45.751 --> 18:48.420
And I couldn't be more excited
to welcome you

18:48.420 --> 18:52.716
to the eighth annual
Little Miss Hastings Pageant,

18:52.716 --> 18:55.719
where one lucky woman
will take home the crown

18:55.719 --> 18:58.597
worn by last year's winner Colleen Murphy.

18:59.765 --> 19:04.895
Yes. Yeah, she looks great.
And a $25 cash prize.

19:05.395 --> 19:06.396
Thank you, Colleen.

19:07.397 --> 19:09.691
I will also be joining
the competition this year.

19:09.691 --> 19:11.610
But feel no pressure to vote for me,

19:12.402 --> 19:14.530
unless you care
about getting your vacation days approved.

19:15.405 --> 19:16.573
I'm kidding.

19:16.573 --> 19:20.619
And without further ado,
I'd like to introduce tonight's emcee,

19:20.619 --> 19:22.287
Dr. Richard Price.

19:26.583 --> 19:29.044
Thank you, Miss Frask.

19:29.044 --> 19:32.214
Wonderful. What a night.
Pretty good turnout tonight.

19:32.214 --> 19:33.590
Okay. Wait.

19:33.590 --> 19:37.845
Hey, before I get started,
just a quick question from management.

19:37.845 --> 19:40.722
Did anyone here lose an electron?

19:41.557 --> 19:43.225
You really gotta keep an ion it.

19:44.309 --> 19:45.227
Ion?

19:45.227 --> 19:47.312
- Everybody got it?
- Ions.

19:47.312 --> 19:51.149
Okay.
Folks, let's get started with the show.

19:51.149 --> 19:55.445
Now, please keep in mind,
these ladies have worked very, very hard.

19:55.445 --> 20:00.909
So please, everybody, let's all make like
a proton and stay positive.

20:03.871 --> 20:08.000
All right. And now, ladies and gentlemen,
the moment we've all been waiting for.

20:08.000 --> 20:14.464
I give you your Little Miss Hastings
1951 contestants.

20:14.464 --> 20:17.759
Here they are. Fantastic.

20:17.759 --> 20:20.971
Aren't they charming? Look at that.

20:26.810 --> 20:32.191
Miss Synthetics, what would you make
your future husband for dessert?

20:33.609 --> 20:37.946
Well, I'd start with two scoops
of vanilla ice cream,

20:37.946 --> 20:41.408
and I'd squeeze chocolate sauce
all over them.

20:42.117 --> 20:45.162
And you'll have to vote for me if you
wanna hear how I apply the whipped cream.

20:46.914 --> 20:48.040
Okay.

20:48.040 --> 20:52.336
Miss Zott, where would be
your fantasy honeymoon location?

20:52.920 --> 20:54.338
I don't intend to get married.

20:55.756 --> 20:57.633
Ye-- Okay, yes. But if you did?

20:57.633 --> 20:58.926
I won't.

20:59.593 --> 21:03.305
Okay.
Well, Miss Zott, everyone. Miss Zott.

21:06.934 --> 21:08.977
I can't stop thinking about you.

21:16.235 --> 21:18.195
- Ladies and gentlemen. Now to...
- Honey. Hi.

21:18.195 --> 21:19.488
- ...lift our spirits with...
- You're here.

21:19.488 --> 21:21.823
- ...a cheer, here is Personnel's...
- Carol's fever broke, so I

21:21.823 --> 21:24.576
- thought I'd join you for some fun.
- ...Miss Fran Frask.

21:25.244 --> 21:32.209
<i>10,000 men of Harvard want victory Today...</i>

21:33.126 --> 21:36.171
You know,
some sex appeal wouldn't hurt, Zott.

21:36.839 --> 21:39.508
You've kind of been embarrassing
the Amino Acids team.

21:40.217 --> 21:41.301
Look at Jenny, huh?

21:41.885 --> 21:43.136
This is a great outfit.

21:43.136 --> 21:47.474
Thanks. My lab paid me ten dollars
to show some skin during my talent.

21:48.475 --> 21:49.476
Smart.

21:49.476 --> 21:54.398
<i>...of Harvard gained victory today</i>

21:56.066 --> 21:57.734
Wow! How about that?

21:57.734 --> 21:59.444
Fran Frask, ladies and gentlemen.

21:59.444 --> 22:02.406
Thank you, Miss Frask.
That was wonderful. My goodness.

22:02.406 --> 22:04.241
- I heard that hydrogen...
- Nancy Donatti.

22:04.241 --> 22:06.118
...and carbon went on a date

22:06.118 --> 22:07.536
and it went really well.

22:07.536 --> 22:09.496
- They really bonded.
- I heard a great deal about you.

22:10.539 --> 22:14.001
Mrs. Donatti,
is there benzaldehyde in your perfume?

22:14.793 --> 22:16.128
What? I don't know.

22:16.837 --> 22:18.005
It's from Paris.

22:18.005 --> 22:20.674
Oh, God. My allergies.

22:20.674 --> 22:23.719
...talents of Elizabeth Zott, Miss Aminos!

22:30.392 --> 22:31.685
Oh, my goodness.

22:34.271 --> 22:35.272
Dr. Evans?

22:36.064 --> 22:39.443
Oh, no. No. I need to go home.

22:39.443 --> 22:41.361
Correct,
but you shouldn't drive in this condition.

22:41.361 --> 22:45.407
I don't drive.
It's only seven miles. I'll walk.

22:46.241 --> 22:47.576
All right. I'll take you then.

22:47.576 --> 22:51.330
- But you hate me.
- Oh, for Christ's sake.

23:05.010 --> 23:07.721
Okay, it's okay.

23:08.305 --> 23:09.723
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

23:09.723 --> 23:11.350
Please stop apologizing.

23:11.350 --> 23:13.727
It can't be helped. The glottis closes.

23:13.727 --> 23:16.605
The abdominal muscles clench,
increasing pressure.

23:16.605 --> 23:18.106
The pyloric sphincter closes.

23:19.107 --> 23:20.734
- Only way out is upwards.
- No, I meant

23:20.734 --> 23:22.736
I'm sorry I called you a secretary.

23:23.529 --> 23:25.489
There's nothing wrong
with being a secretary.

23:26.281 --> 23:29.201
No, of course not. But, to assume was--

23:29.201 --> 23:34.414
was wrong and buffoonish, and I-- Oh, God.

23:34.414 --> 23:36.542
Let's get you inside.

23:38.210 --> 23:39.503
Oh, dear God.

23:53.100 --> 23:54.560
You have nothing in your cupboards.

23:55.352 --> 23:57.479
Yeah, I sometimes forget to eat.

24:00.399 --> 24:01.316
You have one fork.

24:01.316 --> 24:03.110
I don't entertain.

24:06.989 --> 24:09.032
Well, miracle of miracles,
I found a kettle.

24:09.032 --> 24:12.202
Hey, I just-- I want to apologize
once more for the other day.

24:12.202 --> 24:13.787
- I was--
- I can't accept your apology.

24:13.787 --> 24:16.790
I would like to, but you don't know
what you're apologizing for.

24:16.790 --> 24:18.792
And so the entire exercise is meaningless.

24:19.710 --> 24:21.378
Yes, I did borrow some of your ribose.

24:21.378 --> 24:24.214
Some of a very plentiful supply,
if I might add.

24:24.214 --> 24:26.300
But you have all of the resources

24:26.300 --> 24:28.886
and the rapt attention of
the entire scientific community,

24:29.386 --> 24:30.554
and you take it for granted.

24:31.054 --> 24:33.640
You must be intelligent,
based upon your myriad of accomplishments.

24:33.640 --> 24:39.813
But you walk around
like a paranoid, ungrateful, fragile man.

24:41.231 --> 24:46.320
So to respond to your comment earlier,
I don't hate you. I just--

24:47.988 --> 24:49.489
I don't like you.

24:53.994 --> 24:54.995
Thank you.

24:58.957 --> 25:01.084
I have something for you.

25:04.588 --> 25:07.174
It's the only reason
I came to the party tonight.

25:09.343 --> 25:10.344
To bring me ribose?

25:11.345 --> 25:12.930
You have your master's in chemistry.

25:14.348 --> 25:15.349
I do.

25:16.225 --> 25:18.227
You didn't want to pursue a PhD?

25:19.937 --> 25:21.813
It was a complicated situation.

25:24.816 --> 25:26.985
I'm sorry you didn't get to finish
the competition.

25:26.985 --> 25:28.403
Oh, no. I'm not.

25:28.403 --> 25:30.155
What about the cash prize?

25:30.155 --> 25:31.323
Blood money.

25:42.292 --> 25:43.585
May I ask you a question?

25:44.920 --> 25:46.505
I can't promise I'll answer.

25:47.256 --> 25:50.759
What was your talent gonna be
for the pageant?

25:53.220 --> 25:56.473
I was going to place a tomato
in a bowl of boiling water.

25:57.599 --> 26:01.061
As you know,
heat causes molecules to excite.

26:02.145 --> 26:05.065
The flesh of the tomato expands
on the peel.

26:06.066 --> 26:09.653
Then I place it in a bowl of cold water
for approximately 60 seconds,

26:09.653 --> 26:12.447
and the peel slides off easily.

26:15.117 --> 26:16.118
You would have won.

26:20.038 --> 26:21.123
Good night, Dr. Evans.

26:32.134 --> 26:33.594
Watch for cars!

26:33.594 --> 26:35.137
Dr. Evans!

26:38.307 --> 26:39.933
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

26:40.434 --> 26:42.269
What's your favorite color? Guess mine.

26:42.769 --> 26:45.772
Your favorite color? That's hard.

26:45.772 --> 26:48.984
Let's see. I don't know. Aquamarine?

26:49.818 --> 26:51.028
That's not a color.

26:51.570 --> 26:53.322
Well, color is phenomenological.

26:53.322 --> 26:55.824
Linda, can you come finish, please?

26:55.824 --> 26:57.159
Morning, Harriet.

26:57.159 --> 26:58.493
Morning, friend.

26:59.203 --> 27:01.830
These people are shameless. Morning.

27:01.830 --> 27:04.416
More long-lost relatives
looking for long-lost money?

27:05.083 --> 27:07.794
I never should have agreed to be
on the cover of <i>Scientific American</i>.

27:08.337 --> 27:09.213
Once again,

27:09.213 --> 27:12.382
same woman claiming to be my mother
every couple of weeks like clockwork.

27:12.382 --> 27:15.886
If your real mother was alive,
she'd be proud you did that cover.

27:17.012 --> 27:17.846
What's all this?

27:18.430 --> 27:21.725
They wanna connect the 10 Freeway from
downtown all the way to Santa Monica.

27:21.725 --> 27:23.769
Bulldoze right through our backyard.

27:23.769 --> 27:25.062
But people live here.

27:25.062 --> 27:26.855
Now, question is, which people?

27:28.315 --> 27:30.067
Stop it. You're doing it wrong.

27:30.067 --> 27:32.819
Linda, sweetie, it's okay.
Just let him play.

27:34.488 --> 27:37.908
You mind watching them again for me
next Tuesday? I have a committee meeting.

27:37.908 --> 27:39.910
- Of course.
- Thank you.

27:45.541 --> 27:47.876
Miss Zott, can I have a word with you?

27:51.213 --> 27:52.714
Could you please keep the door open?

27:52.714 --> 27:56.260
Your little stunt at the pageant made
the whole Aminos department look foolish.

27:57.803 --> 28:02.140
As your supervisor,
your behavior reflects poorly on me.

28:04.852 --> 28:08.105
This is not how I run my department.
I expect a better attitude.

28:09.731 --> 28:11.316
Embarrass me again and you're done.

29:04.203 --> 29:05.245
May I join you?

29:06.914 --> 29:08.081
You may.

29:12.211 --> 29:13.212
You made that?

29:14.463 --> 29:17.299
Would you like to try some?
I assume you haven't eaten all day.

29:17.299 --> 29:20.511
Oh, no.
I have a sleeve of saltines in my desk.

29:22.429 --> 29:23.639
You must be very constipated.

29:28.810 --> 29:29.811
Thank you.

29:34.525 --> 29:36.777
Wow. That's--

29:37.694 --> 29:41.156
I've never had-- That's perfect.

29:42.533 --> 29:44.952
It's not perfect,
but it has the potential to be.

29:45.536 --> 29:46.912
This is my 78th attempt.

29:48.288 --> 29:49.665
My current focus is cheese.

29:51.375 --> 29:52.334
Cheese?

29:52.835 --> 29:56.421
At about 92 degrees, the solid milk fat
in the cheese liquefies,

29:56.421 --> 29:59.967
and the bonds holding together the casein
proteins break. But the melt isn't smooth.

29:59.967 --> 30:01.134
It isn't?

30:01.134 --> 30:04.388
No. Which is why I've been
experimenting with sodium citrate.

30:04.388 --> 30:06.265
The sodium substitutes for
some of the calcium

30:06.265 --> 30:09.309
that's causing the proteins to cling,
so when the cheese heats--

30:09.309 --> 30:11.979
Proteins separate from each other,
acting as emulsifiers,

30:12.479 --> 30:15.524
strengthening the emulsion
by holding water and fat together.

30:16.149 --> 30:16.984
Precisely.

30:16.984 --> 30:22.155
And you needed my ribose
to perfect your lasagna recipe?

30:22.155 --> 30:25.576
No. Lasagna is my dinner.
I needed your ribose for my research.

30:28.996 --> 30:31.540
Ninety-nine percent of
the human body is made up of carbon,

30:31.540 --> 30:35.043
hydrogen, nitrogen, oxygen, calcium,
phosphorus, with a few ions thrown in.

30:35.043 --> 30:37.796
But how did we get to
this level of complexity here on Earth?

30:37.796 --> 30:40.716
The two of us sitting here
at this table, talking,

30:40.716 --> 30:44.469
going from a soup of atoms
and small molecules to now with--

30:46.013 --> 30:47.806
That is what I'm trying to uncover.

30:47.806 --> 30:49.558
Abiogenesis.

30:49.558 --> 30:51.226
You're interested in it?

30:51.894 --> 30:52.978
Keeps me up at night.

30:56.607 --> 30:57.608
Me too.

31:08.285 --> 31:10.621
I've read your past papers,
but what are you working on currently?

31:12.831 --> 31:14.750
I'm doing exploratory research on--

31:14.750 --> 31:18.378
on natural enzyme identification,
isolation, classification.

31:18.879 --> 31:20.547
It's-- That smells good.

31:20.547 --> 31:22.299
Is that mashed potatoes?

31:24.218 --> 31:25.219
Excuse me.

31:27.804 --> 31:28.639
Man alive.

31:42.194 --> 31:44.446
No. That doesn't
make any sense, 'cause that--

31:44.446 --> 31:46.281
that doesn't explain
how you closed the ring.

31:46.281 --> 31:48.867
Sure. But when
a polyphosphoric acid is applied,

31:48.867 --> 31:52.746
it creates phosphate esters with
a high monoester content. See?

31:57.167 --> 31:58.335
That's a pretty good point.

32:08.262 --> 32:10.472
It is a bit of a chicken
and egg situation,

32:10.472 --> 32:12.015
but if you consider Occam's razor,

32:12.015 --> 32:16.144
would nature choose a system that is more
complex to create something less complex?

32:17.062 --> 32:18.313
So RNA world theory?

32:18.313 --> 32:21.149
Miss Zott, I'm gonna be needing
one of your special cups of joe

32:21.149 --> 32:22.401
to get me through this afternoon.

32:22.401 --> 32:23.735
Right.

32:23.735 --> 32:26.071
<i>Of course, I would be much
further along in my research</i>

32:26.071 --> 32:28.949
if I wasn't making excellent coffee
for mediocre chemists.

32:28.949 --> 32:31.493
You're on the verge of
a major scientific breakthrough.

32:31.493 --> 32:33.829
- You need to talk to Donatti.
- I did. He said no.

32:34.955 --> 32:36.331
That doesn't make any sense. Why?

32:37.040 --> 32:38.250
Sex discrimination.

32:39.459 --> 32:40.544
What?

32:40.544 --> 32:43.338
Well, also politics and favoritism
and general unfairness.

32:43.338 --> 32:44.965
But yes, mostly sex discrimination.

32:45.799 --> 32:48.135
I don't understand.
Why would anyone discriminate based on

32:48.135 --> 32:51.054
something as intellectually
non-determinative as gender?

32:51.054 --> 32:55.225
Calvin, how many female scientists
can you name?

32:56.185 --> 32:57.186
Madame Curie.

32:58.520 --> 33:01.690
Exactly. Do you think that's
just by happenstance?

33:03.817 --> 33:07.196
I don't know.
I hadn't considered it until now.

33:07.196 --> 33:11.283
Of course. You haven't had to, because
people fully appreciate your potential.

33:12.201 --> 33:13.035
This is me.

33:15.579 --> 33:16.997
Raise your hand if you'd like coffee.

33:24.671 --> 33:26.173
Okay. I've been thinking.

33:26.965 --> 33:30.010
My enzyme research would benefit
from your molecular synthesis work.

33:30.010 --> 33:32.888
So I can talk to Donatti,
tell him to let you work for me,

33:32.888 --> 33:35.140
and then you'd be able
to focus entirely on your own research.

33:35.140 --> 33:37.976
No, Donatti would never hire me
as a chemist. Only a lab tech.

33:37.976 --> 33:41.688
Technically. But you'd be doing
independent research, actual chemistry.

33:41.688 --> 33:43.190
You would have free rein.

33:43.190 --> 33:45.234
But I'd be a lab tech to everyone else.

33:45.234 --> 33:48.695
Obviously. In a perfect world,
you wouldn't need help from anyone.

33:48.695 --> 33:50.864
But, as you pointed out very lucidly,

33:50.864 --> 33:53.200
you are working within a system
that is pervasively unfair.

33:53.200 --> 33:55.452
For you to operate as if it were fair,
that's--

33:55.452 --> 33:57.996
Can you explain to
me how that makes any sense at all?

33:57.996 --> 34:00.332
I'll treat you as an equal.

34:00.332 --> 34:02.417
Hell, you're one of
the smartest people in this lab.

34:02.960 --> 34:05.963
Calvin, it doesn't matter if
I work with you or for you.

34:05.963 --> 34:09.257
People will view the work as yours.
I'll never be seen as a scientist.

34:09.257 --> 34:11.301
When you publish as lead scientist,
they will.

34:16.389 --> 34:19.393
Are you wearing pajamas?

34:20.060 --> 34:24.398
No. That's my running gear.
I run to and from work.

34:25.357 --> 34:27.067
What does that mean, you run?

34:27.067 --> 34:29.820
I run, you know, for exercise.

34:29.820 --> 34:32.030
I know people find it odd,
but it helps quiet my mind.

34:35.449 --> 34:36.702
Think about my offer.

34:44.001 --> 34:45.043
Calvin?

34:46.962 --> 34:47.963
Yes.

34:49.797 --> 34:50.799
Yes?

34:51.842 --> 34:53.010
Yes.

34:55.262 --> 34:58.182
I shower in my lab,

34:58.182 --> 34:59.933
so just knock before entering.

35:01.768 --> 35:03.312
Rest assured, I will knock.

35:12.154 --> 35:15.824
There is protocol, Miss Zott. When you
don't follow protocol, it falls on me.

35:15.824 --> 35:18.035
Do you have any idea
the blowback that I got

35:18.035 --> 35:19.953
when you left the pageant halfway through?

35:20.454 --> 35:22.122
I am sympathetic, Miss Frask,

35:22.122 --> 35:24.208
but I'd really like to
stay focused on my request.

35:25.417 --> 35:26.668
It's a bad idea.

35:26.668 --> 35:29.546
If you need a lab tech, there's plenty
of good fellas for you to choose from.

35:29.546 --> 35:32.549
Oh, boy, this is sex discrimination.

35:32.549 --> 35:34.009
I don't even know what that means.

35:34.009 --> 35:36.637
Miss Frask,
I did not take this decision lightly.

35:36.637 --> 35:38.222
His intentions are purely professional.

35:38.222 --> 35:41.141
Oh, honey, there's no such thing as
a professional relationship

35:41.141 --> 35:42.309
between a man and a woman.

35:42.309 --> 35:43.977
I didn't think you'd be
as foolish as that.

35:43.977 --> 35:47.189
There's a reason he's dead set on you,
and I don't think it's your CV.

35:47.189 --> 35:50.609
How many women chemists can you name,
aside from Madame Curie?

35:50.609 --> 35:53.362
- She's unqualified.
- I didn't come here asking for permission.

35:53.362 --> 35:56.406
I came here to make sure that
the paperwork was filled out correctly.

35:57.074 --> 36:01.662
Evans, you walk around here
like you own the place, which is fine.

36:01.662 --> 36:04.081
As long as
the Remsen funding keeps flowing.

36:04.581 --> 36:06.875
But as soon as the money dries up,
you're gone.

36:07.584 --> 36:10.587
We are colleagues.
Nothing more, nothing less.

36:12.089 --> 36:13.507
No, dear. You're his lab tech.

36:13.507 --> 36:15.759
And I've seen this before. Men are men.

36:15.759 --> 36:18.428
He will change his mind. And then what?

36:29.356 --> 36:31.108
Everything good with Miss Frask?

36:31.108 --> 36:33.235
Boilerplate. And Donatti?

36:33.235 --> 36:34.736
A breeze.

36:36.363 --> 36:37.614
I prefer the door open.

36:39.950 --> 36:40.868
Okay, sure.

36:44.705 --> 36:48.292
So, I organized our equipment in
a way that a sane person might appreciate,

36:48.292 --> 36:50.127
and I swept up the saltine crumbs.

36:50.669 --> 36:51.587
Not because I'm a woman,

36:51.587 --> 36:55.007
but because I can't imagine a worse
substance to be in a chemistry lab.

36:56.633 --> 36:58.302
The underwear is your responsibility.

37:17.696 --> 37:19.489
Did you move the graduated cylinders?

37:20.574 --> 37:22.993
I thought
the center table was more equidistant.

37:31.919 --> 37:34.421
How can you work
when the music is so loud?

37:34.421 --> 37:37.925
It's the only way I can think.
You moved the spatulas too?

37:44.932 --> 37:47.392
You've never shared space
with someone, have you?

37:49.102 --> 37:50.562
I like things the way I like them.

37:58.320 --> 38:02.282
Calvin, it's not that I don't like music.

38:02.282 --> 38:07.996
I just don't like this music.
It's cluttered.

38:07.996 --> 38:10.749
That's what I like about it.
It helps me think.

38:10.749 --> 38:12.584
You never know what's gonna
come around the corner.

38:12.584 --> 38:15.879
A trumpet, huh? Here comes
the drums. It's exciting.

38:16.547 --> 38:17.548
Noise.

38:18.090 --> 38:21.593
Or I just appreciate something different.

38:22.553 --> 38:25.264
Predictability. Formulaic structure.

38:26.598 --> 38:29.977
I like the way the chords move,
change, build upon one another,

38:29.977 --> 38:33.689
like basic components into molecules.

38:38.360 --> 38:39.194
What?

39:09.850 --> 39:12.311
You're late.
I already started the first trial.

39:13.437 --> 39:17.691
I thought we could alternate every day.

39:21.904 --> 39:23.113
Compromise.

39:34.208 --> 39:35.584
What do we have here?

41:28.864 --> 41:31.491
- Zott residence.
- Hi. It's Calvin.

41:32.701 --> 41:34.369
Calvin Evans. Your lab partner.

41:36.371 --> 41:37.581
Calvin, it's almost 8:00 p.m.

41:38.081 --> 41:41.001
Yeah, I just-- I can't stop thinking
about the last thing you said

41:41.001 --> 41:43.754
<i>about the basic structure
of pyrimidines and purines,</i>

41:43.754 --> 41:47.049
<i>and it led me somewhere
I had previously dismissed.</i>

41:47.049 --> 41:48.217
Nuclein independence?

41:48.759 --> 41:49.635
<i>Yes.</i>

41:50.177 --> 41:51.470
Hold on. Let me grab my notebook.

41:55.557 --> 41:57.893
I was actually just jotting
something down earlier

41:57.893 --> 42:00.229
about Miescher's theory
on the high phosphorus content of--

42:03.857 --> 42:04.691
Hold on.

42:05.275 --> 42:06.944
- <i>Oh, shit.</i>
- Elizabeth?

42:07.986 --> 42:12.616
Shit. I have to go.

42:12.616 --> 42:15.661
- What happened?
- I just burnt my dinner.

42:16.161 --> 42:19.414
Oh, my goodness.
I thought it was something serious.

42:19.414 --> 42:21.667
Well, this is serious.
I don't burn things.

42:21.667 --> 42:24.127
Really? Never?
You've never burnt anything?

42:24.127 --> 42:27.297
No. I wasn't concentrating.

42:27.798 --> 42:30.467
Well, sometimes mistakes
can be a good thing.

42:31.051 --> 42:33.804
<i>They can lead us to what we don't expect.</i>

42:35.389 --> 42:36.431
I have to go. Good night.

42:45.232 --> 42:46.233
Okay.

43:00.497 --> 43:01.498
Oh, man.

43:07.421 --> 43:08.297
That's it.

43:19.349 --> 43:20.851
I had an epiphany on my run.

43:22.144 --> 43:23.812
Could you please open the door?

43:23.812 --> 43:25.063
- You inspired this.
- Calvin.

43:25.063 --> 43:27.107
- It's like you said. Occam's razor.
- Calvin.

43:27.107 --> 43:30.903
What if nucleic acids can actually
encode far more complex molecules?

43:30.903 --> 43:32.988
- Like, say, a--
- Calvin, I said, the door!

43:33.572 --> 43:34.531
Elizabeth.

43:37.576 --> 43:41.747
Elizabeth. Is everything okay?
Did I do something?

43:44.124 --> 43:45.125
This was a mistake.

43:45.834 --> 43:47.002
I don't understand.

43:53.967 --> 43:57.513
The Maillard reaction quickly browned
the meat before placing it in the oven.

43:57.513 --> 43:59.181
Now, let's see the fruits of our labor.

44:08.273 --> 44:09.149
Oh, my God.

44:16.240 --> 44:18.992
- Walter, should we cut to commercial?
- No. I don't know. No.

44:21.703 --> 44:23.330
That was not the intended outcome.

44:31.255 --> 44:35.425
In science, you endeavor to control
every variable of your experiment.

44:36.176 --> 44:39.429
The temperature in your lab,
the number of contaminants,

44:40.138 --> 44:42.724
the correct calibration for
each piece of equipment.

44:45.102 --> 44:48.105
<i>Sometimes you can't count on a formula.</i>

44:48.939 --> 44:51.441
<i>Sometimes you can't control each variable.</i>

44:52.776 --> 44:53.777
<i>Sometimes--</i>

44:56.405 --> 44:57.406
<i>Many times...</i>

45:00.033 --> 45:01.451
things just turn out messy.

45:05.038 --> 45:08.125
Sometimes you will burn the lasagna.

45:22.097 --> 45:23.682
So I guess it's leftovers tonight.

45:25.142 --> 45:28.228
Children, set the table.
Your mother needs a moment for herself.
