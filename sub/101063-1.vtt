(soft electronic music)

00:23.625 --> 00:26.458
(screen crackles)

00:28.541 --> 00:31.375
(screen crackles)

00:34.583 --> 00:37.416
(screen crackles)

00:42.041 --> 00:44.875
(screen crackles)

00:47.333 --> 00:50.166
(screen crackles)

00:54.166 --> 00:55.208
- More people have been killed

00:55.208 --> 00:57.416
at schools this year than have been killed

00:57.416 --> 00:59.500
while serving in the military,

00:59.500 --> 01:01.000
in fact, nearly twice as many.

01:03.625 --> 01:04.458
(screen crackles)

01:04.458 --> 01:06.333
- School day, and it was almost over

01:06.333 --> 01:08.583
when gunfire erupted this afternoon.

01:11.250 --> 01:12.083
(screen crackles)

01:12.083 --> 01:13.875
- Breaking news now, in downtown Detroit,

01:13.875 --> 01:16.208
where we're being told
a woman has been shot.

01:18.916 --> 01:19.750
(screen crackles)

01:19.750 --> 01:23.125
- 60 people were killed because a man went

01:23.125 --> 01:26.500
into a gay nightclub, and had two guns,

01:26.500 --> 01:28.000
and was able to murder them.

01:30.791 --> 01:33.500
- Think that reinstating the ban

01:33.500 --> 01:37.333
on assault weapons and banning
high-capacity magazines

01:37.333 --> 01:38.541
would do any good?

01:38.541 --> 01:40.208
- Yes, I do.

01:43.583 --> 01:44.416
(screen crackles)

01:44.416 --> 01:45.791
- Congressman Eric Swalwell, a Democrat

01:45.791 --> 01:47.083
from the San Francisco Bay area,

01:47.083 --> 01:48.625
has a solution for gun violence.

01:48.625 --> 01:50.125
He's writing this in an op-ed.

01:53.208 --> 01:54.041
(screen crackles)

01:54.041 --> 01:55.708
- Criminally prosecute any who choose

01:55.708 --> 01:58.375
to defy it by keeping their weapons.

01:58.375 --> 01:59.416
We should confiscate.

02:02.000 --> 02:03.125
What do you think would happen

02:03.125 --> 02:05.291
if the federal government
tried to do that?

02:06.458 --> 02:08.041
- [Clown] Introduce yourself.

02:09.333 --> 02:12.791
I said, introduce yourself.

02:13.916 --> 02:14.750
Fine.

02:16.083 --> 02:17.125
Be that way.

02:18.000 --> 02:20.291
Meet Maya.

02:20.291 --> 02:25.291
I say we start the bid
at, uh, 25,000 yuan?

02:25.625 --> 02:27.625
75,000?

02:27.625 --> 02:32.625
Shit, going once, going twice.

02:33.250 --> 02:35.666
Wait a minute, 200,000?

02:35.666 --> 02:37.625
Shit, sold.

02:37.625 --> 02:39.416
- If you are just tuning in,

02:39.416 --> 02:42.291
you've just witnessed what
appears to be live footage

02:42.291 --> 02:44.333
of another woman being auctioned off

02:44.333 --> 02:48.250
via an untraceable app that
has taken the web by storm.

02:48.250 --> 02:50.583
We are asking our viewers for any tips

02:50.583 --> 02:52.250
to help bring Maya home.

02:59.500 --> 03:00.333
- Dinner's ready.

03:19.125 --> 03:19.958
Bri.

03:21.875 --> 03:23.750
- In other news, a man appears

03:23.750 --> 03:26.166
to have randomly entered a shopping mall,

03:26.166 --> 03:28.375
killing 12 people with a morning star

03:28.375 --> 03:29.416
before being detained

03:29.416 --> 03:32.333
by local authority officer J. Peterson.

03:32.333 --> 03:35.208
Are we truly safe without guns?

03:35.208 --> 03:36.041
- [Deon] TV off.

03:36.041 --> 03:38.250
- [Virtual Assistant] Powering off.

03:38.250 --> 03:39.583
- You didn't hear me calling you?

03:39.583 --> 03:41.666
- No, what's up?

03:41.666 --> 03:42.750
- Dinner's ready.

03:42.750 --> 03:45.708
- Okay, I'll be there in a minute, my bad.

03:45.708 --> 03:47.583
- All right, you cool?

03:47.583 --> 03:48.916
- Mm-hm.

03:48.916 --> 03:51.541
- All right.
(phone buzzes)

03:54.458 --> 03:55.291
Hello?

03:55.291 --> 03:56.875
- [Tay] I can't do this.

03:56.875 --> 03:58.416
I can't do this.

03:58.416 --> 04:00.291
She is getting on my nerves.

04:00.291 --> 04:01.125
- Okay, hold on, wait.

04:01.125 --> 04:02.666
You can't cancel now.

04:02.666 --> 04:04.041
- [Tay] The hell I can't.

04:04.041 --> 04:06.000
I'm-a go on this honeymoon without her.

04:06.000 --> 04:07.541
Yep, that's what I'm-a do,

04:07.541 --> 04:09.125
and I'm-a pawn this ring,

04:09.125 --> 04:10.791
and open up a surfboard shop

04:10.791 --> 04:12.750
on the coast.
- Listen, listen.

04:12.750 --> 04:15.250
Planning and getting
through it is the hard part,

04:16.083 --> 04:18.791
but nothing worth having is easy.

04:18.791 --> 04:21.208
(Tay laughs)

04:22.250 --> 04:24.875
- [Tay] And I'm supposed
to be the big brother.

04:24.875 --> 04:27.875
- Yeah, man, we just talk
about it tomorrow morning.

04:27.875 --> 04:28.916
- [Tay] All right, bro.

04:28.916 --> 04:29.791
- All right.

04:29.791 --> 04:30.916
- [Tay] See you then.

04:50.833 --> 04:52.458
(wood creaks)

04:52.458 --> 04:54.291
- [Tami] Apparently, no one has heard

04:54.291 --> 04:56.041
from the pastor in days.

04:56.041 --> 04:56.875
- What?

04:57.875 --> 05:00.458
- [Tami] This has turned
out to be such a disaster.

05:00.458 --> 05:02.250
Think it's a sign I shouldn't get married?

05:02.250 --> 05:06.291
- Now, Tami, you know
anything worth having

05:06.291 --> 05:08.791
is not gonna be easy at all.

05:08.791 --> 05:10.416
- [Tami] Yeah, I know.

05:10.416 --> 05:12.375
It's just so frustrating.

05:12.375 --> 05:14.000
I just want tomorrow to be perfect.

05:14.000 --> 05:16.083
- Okay, and I get that,

05:16.083 --> 05:19.291
but you know it's gonna work out.

05:19.291 --> 05:21.666
- [Tami] Yeah, I guess you're right.

05:25.333 --> 05:28.583
- All right, well, I'm-a
see you tomorrow, okay?

05:28.583 --> 05:29.416
- [Tami] Okay.

05:30.375 --> 05:31.958
- All right, and Tami.

05:31.958 --> 05:32.958
- [Tami] Yes?

05:32.958 --> 05:34.500
- Try not to kill anybody, all right?

05:34.500 --> 05:36.583
- [Tami] (chuckles) I'll try my best.

05:37.416 --> 05:38.250
- Bye, girl.

05:38.250 --> 05:39.083
- [Tami] Bye.

05:43.041 --> 05:44.083
- Those two.

05:45.416 --> 05:46.583
- Tell me about it.

05:47.583 --> 05:49.916
- Ooh, but this looks good.

05:49.916 --> 05:51.666
Thank you.

05:51.666 --> 05:52.583
- You welcome.

06:08.291 --> 06:10.333
So, you okay?

06:12.125 --> 06:13.916
Your vibe's been off today.

06:17.375 --> 06:18.333
- Yeah, I'm good.

06:19.958 --> 06:24.083
I'm just trying to get used
to these new laws, you know?

06:24.083 --> 06:25.416
It just doesn't make sense.

06:27.833 --> 06:28.750
- You and me both.

06:29.750 --> 06:33.250
- But let's not talk about that.

06:34.291 --> 06:36.666
Let's just enjoy this great meal

06:36.666 --> 06:38.916
that you made for us, okay?

06:40.000 --> 06:44.041
- But you can't tell me

06:44.041 --> 06:45.583
that this is the nicest thing

06:45.583 --> 06:47.958
that anyone has ever said to you.

06:57.541 --> 06:59.666
- You can't be serious right now.

06:59.666 --> 07:00.958
- I am serious right now.

07:02.291 --> 07:04.958
(traffic whirs)

07:07.416 --> 07:10.250
(car door closes)

07:18.166 --> 07:21.333
(train whistle blows)

07:29.583 --> 07:32.916
(soft orchestral music)

07:57.000 --> 07:58.875
- Babe, listen to this.

07:58.875 --> 08:00.750
The odometer will display error

08:00.750 --> 08:05.000
if an internal IPC memory
failure is detected,

08:05.000 --> 08:06.541
or if, like, there's a communication fault

08:06.541 --> 08:08.625
between the PCM and the BCM.

08:10.333 --> 08:11.625
- I don't even know what that means.

08:11.625 --> 08:13.625
- (laughs) Me either.

08:13.625 --> 08:17.791
Um, I guess the PCM is the
power train control module,

08:17.791 --> 08:21.250
and the BCM is the body control module.

08:21.250 --> 08:23.041
- So a computer issue.

08:23.041 --> 08:24.541
- That'll be my guess.

08:26.250 --> 08:28.625
(car hood closes)

08:28.625 --> 08:31.333
- I didn't think I'd need my
roadside assistance so soon.

08:34.041 --> 08:36.750
- Hopefully, they get here before curfew.

08:36.750 --> 08:38.957
- Let's just hope they
don't take that long.

08:39.875 --> 08:41.125
Go ahead, get in the car.

08:43.082 --> 08:46.416
- [Lauren] Thank you for
calling Aggressive Insurance.

08:46.416 --> 08:47.541
My name is Lauren.

08:47.541 --> 08:49.083
Are you in a safe location?

08:49.083 --> 08:49.916
(Bri snorts)

08:49.916 --> 08:51.291
- Hell nah.

08:51.291 --> 08:53.208
- Our car has stalled, and it won't start.

08:53.208 --> 08:54.833
- [Lauren] I'm so sorry to hear that.

08:54.833 --> 08:56.333
May I have your policy number?

08:57.208 --> 08:58.750
- [Deon] Yeah, hold on a sec.

08:58.750 --> 08:59.958
- [Lauren] No problem, take your time.

08:59.958 --> 09:01.708
Just let me know when you're ready.

09:04.833 --> 09:06.333
- All right, I'm ready.

09:06.333 --> 09:11.333
Um, 4522854, B as in boy,

09:12.291 --> 09:15.666
0221, and A as in apple.

09:16.541 --> 09:17.750
- [Lauren] Perfect.

09:17.750 --> 09:20.208
I have you at Brian Wood
Lane in Clinton, Michigan.

09:20.208 --> 09:21.041
Is that correct?

09:22.125 --> 09:22.958
- Yes, ma'am.

09:25.208 --> 09:28.250
- [Lauren] Okay, and what
are your nearest crossroads.

09:29.166 --> 09:30.583
- Uh, let me check.

09:33.125 --> 09:34.166
- [Lauren] Can you give me the address

09:34.166 --> 09:35.750
of the closest home or building?

09:38.250 --> 09:40.125
- There's, like, nothing
really out here, so.

09:40.125 --> 09:40.958
- [Lauren] Okay.

09:41.958 --> 09:44.458
Where will you be towing the vehicle?

09:44.458 --> 09:45.875
- To the nearest dealership.

09:47.750 --> 09:49.750
- [Lauren] Hm, let me take a look.

09:51.541 --> 09:53.833
It looks like the
closest is Page Chevrolet

09:53.833 --> 09:54.875
on Wolford Avenue.

09:55.750 --> 09:57.333
- Uh-huh.

09:57.333 --> 09:58.625
- [Lauren] All right, sir.

10:00.208 --> 10:01.958
So I put in your request for a tow.

10:01.958 --> 10:05.125
They should be contacting
you with the ETA shortly.

10:05.125 --> 10:06.000
Is there anything else I can do

10:06.000 --> 10:07.458
to assist you today?

10:07.458 --> 10:10.833
- Do the dealership loan
out loaners for customers?

10:10.833 --> 10:11.666
- [Lauren] I can provide you

10:11.666 --> 10:13.458
with their contact
information, if you like.

10:13.458 --> 10:14.958
- No, I'm straight.

10:14.958 --> 10:16.000
I'll get it.

10:16.000 --> 10:17.375
- [Lauren] Okay, thank you

10:17.375 --> 10:19.458
for calling Aggressive's
roadside assistance.

10:19.458 --> 10:21.458
I hope your day gets a
lot better from here.

10:21.458 --> 10:23.125
- Thank you, you too.

10:23.125 --> 10:25.791
(traffic whirs)

10:29.750 --> 10:30.583
Bae.

10:30.583 --> 10:33.125
- Yeah, what'd they say?

10:37.958 --> 10:41.916
- Nothing yet, but you know how they are.

10:41.916 --> 10:42.750
- Yeah.

10:43.791 --> 10:45.041
Well, aren't you glad
we made it out the hood?

10:45.041 --> 10:46.833
(phone rings)

10:46.833 --> 10:48.083
- Hell yeah.

10:48.083 --> 10:51.500
(eerie electronic music)

10:52.541 --> 10:53.375
- [Ashley] Hey, girl.

10:53.375 --> 10:54.708
- [Bri] Hey, girl.

10:54.708 --> 10:55.833
- [Ashley] How far are you two?

10:55.833 --> 10:58.500
- [Bri] Not far, but our car broke down.

10:58.500 --> 10:59.958
- [Ashley] What?

10:59.958 --> 11:02.208
Oh my god, are you two okay?

11:02.208 --> 11:04.333
- Yeah, but I don't know,

11:04.333 --> 11:07.291
it just cut off on us for whatever reason.

11:07.291 --> 11:09.333
- [Ashley] Didn't he just get that thing?

11:09.333 --> 11:11.916
You know bridezilla's gonna
flip when she hears this.

11:11.916 --> 11:13.250
- Yeah, no doubt.

11:13.250 --> 11:15.541
- [Ashley] She already
getting on my damn nerve.

11:15.541 --> 11:16.958
I'm so over this day,

11:16.958 --> 11:18.416
and it hasn't even started yet.

11:18.416 --> 11:21.541
- Look, girl, all I want to
do is go back to the hotel,

11:21.541 --> 11:25.833
get some chocolate-covered
strawberries, and just chill.

11:25.833 --> 11:27.625
- [Ashley] I'm so jealous.

11:27.625 --> 11:31.250
All I'm gonna do tonight is
Netflix and chill with my cat.

11:31.250 --> 11:32.791
(laughs)

11:32.791 --> 11:34.958
Anyway, keep me updated.

11:34.958 --> 11:36.666
- [Bri] Girl, you know I will.

11:36.666 --> 11:37.875
- [Ashley] All right, bye.

11:37.875 --> 11:38.958
- Bye.

11:38.958 --> 11:39.791
- Howdy.

11:42.916 --> 11:44.250
- Hi.

11:44.250 --> 11:45.666
- How you doing?

11:45.666 --> 11:47.833
Yeah, you just kinda
scared us a little bit.

11:47.833 --> 11:48.666
- I'm sorry.

11:48.666 --> 11:49.708
Are you okay?

11:49.708 --> 11:51.541
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

11:51.541 --> 11:52.375
- Are you okay?

11:54.583 --> 11:58.291
- I'm fine, but just wanted to check

11:58.291 --> 12:00.083
to see if you're okay.

12:00.083 --> 12:02.125
Is there anything I can help you with?

12:02.125 --> 12:04.541
- No, we got a tow truck on the way.

12:04.541 --> 12:06.500
Got some car issues, but we're fine.

12:08.791 --> 12:10.625
- Tow trucks and police,

12:11.958 --> 12:14.625
they're awfully slow around here.

12:14.625 --> 12:15.833
- Yeah, we--

12:15.833 --> 12:16.666
- Figures.

12:16.666 --> 12:18.041
- Right.

12:18.041 --> 12:22.000
- If you're sure you're
okay, I'll mosey on.

12:22.000 --> 12:24.041
- Oh, sir, wait, hold on.

12:24.041 --> 12:25.083
Just wait one second.

12:37.375 --> 12:40.291
Here you go, thank you so much, Mr.

12:41.166 --> 12:42.541
- Willie.

12:42.541 --> 12:43.375
- Willie.

12:43.375 --> 12:44.958
- Willie Jackson, ma'am.

12:44.958 --> 12:47.250
- [Bri] Well, thank you,
that was so kind of you.

12:47.250 --> 12:51.833
- Thank you, but I've
got everything I need.

12:51.833 --> 12:54.583
Just wanted to make sure
you folks were all right.

12:54.583 --> 12:55.416
- Thank you.

12:55.416 --> 12:57.916
- We appreciate it, thank you.

12:59.666 --> 13:01.500
- Lots of crazies around here.

13:09.833 --> 13:11.958
Good-bye, be blessed.

13:13.833 --> 13:14.666
- You too.

13:17.291 --> 13:20.208
Wow, I've never seen a homeless
man turn down money before.

13:20.208 --> 13:21.541
- I know, right?

13:31.541 --> 13:35.125
(smacks steering wheel)

13:35.125 --> 13:37.708
- Babe, it's okay.

13:39.000 --> 13:41.250
Black weddings don't start on time anyway.

13:41.250 --> 13:42.833
- You know I hate being late.

13:42.833 --> 13:43.666
- Yeah.

13:44.625 --> 13:46.458
- And I can't let Tay down.

13:48.041 --> 13:49.458
- We're gonna make it.

13:49.458 --> 13:51.375
I'll just text Ashley the latest.

13:52.958 --> 13:55.041
Man, she's gonna flip.

13:55.041 --> 13:55.958
- She is.

13:55.958 --> 13:57.666
I'll just get you an Uber.

13:58.666 --> 14:01.875
- No, I'm not leaving you.

14:02.750 --> 14:06.083
- Bae, it's better for
one of us to be there

14:06.083 --> 14:07.750
than we both miss it.

14:07.750 --> 14:09.333
- We're not gonna miss it.

14:09.333 --> 14:10.375
We're gonna make it,

14:11.208 --> 14:13.041
and I'd rather miss it

14:13.041 --> 14:15.500
than to let you be here by yourself.

14:16.625 --> 14:18.041
Anything can happen to you.

14:18.041 --> 14:19.583
- Come on, it's the middle of the daytime.

14:19.583 --> 14:20.416
Ain't nothing gonna happen.

14:20.416 --> 14:21.291
I'll be fine.

14:21.291 --> 14:24.208
- No, I'm not leaving you
here, and that's that.

14:25.416 --> 14:27.875
- All right, I was just trying to help.

14:27.875 --> 14:30.291
- I know you are, but we're gonna make it.

14:32.041 --> 14:32.875
- All right.

14:44.750 --> 14:47.041
I was thinking, let's finish

14:47.041 --> 14:48.958
where we left off this morning.

14:48.958 --> 14:52.000
I mean, we got time right now.

14:52.958 --> 14:53.875
(Bri laughs)

14:53.875 --> 14:57.666
- We is not about to do
it here, in the daytime.

14:57.666 --> 14:59.500
Who does it in the daytime?

14:59.500 --> 15:00.875
- I seen a couple doing it yesterday.

15:00.875 --> 15:01.708
- [Bri] Really?

15:01.708 --> 15:02.666
- [Deon] Yes, in broad daylight.

15:02.666 --> 15:03.500
- No.

15:07.333 --> 15:08.833
(eerie electronic music)

15:08.833 --> 15:10.083
- Hey, you straight, fam?

15:11.333 --> 15:13.666
I didn't mean to mess up
y'all situation or nothing.

15:14.916 --> 15:15.958
- [Deon] You need some help, bro?

15:15.958 --> 15:16.791
- No, I'm good.

15:16.791 --> 15:17.625

15:17.625 --> 15:19.125

15:19.125 --> 15:20.208

15:20.208 --> 15:22.000
- Ain't no thing, I just want to make sure

15:22.000 --> 15:23.875
everything was everything, man.

15:23.875 --> 15:25.791
Y'all looking real nice.

15:25.791 --> 15:27.791
Y'all going somewhere special?

15:27.791 --> 15:29.125

15:29.125 --> 15:32.166

15:32.166 --> 15:33.041
- All right then.

15:34.000 --> 15:34.833

15:34.833 --> 15:35.666

15:35.666 --> 15:36.666
- Yeah, all right.

15:36.666 --> 15:37.541
Appreciate it, though.

15:37.541 --> 15:38.583
- Any time, fam.

15:40.333 --> 15:41.791
- Man, it's crazy how
these people be sometime.

15:41.791 --> 15:42.750
- Babe, babe.

15:42.750 --> 15:46.875
(dramatic orchestral music)

15:46.875 --> 15:47.708
Hey.

15:49.166 --> 15:50.958
- Come on, bro.

15:50.958 --> 15:52.166
No, bro.

15:52.166 --> 15:53.958
Thought it was a game?

15:53.958 --> 15:55.333
Look, I don't want to hurt you.

15:55.333 --> 15:56.791
Just do what I ask.

15:56.791 --> 15:58.125
I want your wallet.

15:58.125 --> 15:59.291
Give it to me.

16:00.583 --> 16:02.416
Just get it, hurry up.

16:03.250 --> 16:04.458
Oh, shit.

16:04.458 --> 16:06.208
Oh, look, look, oh no, oh no.

16:06.208 --> 16:07.458
- I'm tired.

16:07.458 --> 16:08.666
I've had a bad day,

16:08.666 --> 16:10.791
and you're not making it any better.

16:10.791 --> 16:13.291
- [Strange Guy] Hey, I'm
just trying to feed my kids.

16:13.291 --> 16:15.458
- It's called getting a J-O-B.

16:15.458 --> 16:17.625
Why don't you get one of those?

16:17.625 --> 16:18.458
- [Strange Guy] Look, look, whatever,

16:18.458 --> 16:19.291
just take your shit back,

16:19.291 --> 16:20.791
but put the gun down.

16:20.791 --> 16:23.708
- Don't you come back
here with yo broke ass,

16:23.708 --> 16:25.291
do you understand me?

16:25.291 --> 16:26.583
Now leave us alone.

16:26.583 --> 16:27.416
- Whatever.

16:27.416 --> 16:28.875
I'm turning my life over to God.

16:37.375 --> 16:39.041
(Deon pants)

16:39.041 --> 16:40.458
Baby, are you okay?

16:40.458 --> 16:41.833
- Yeah, are you okay?

16:41.833 --> 16:43.041
- Yeah, I'm fine.

16:44.791 --> 16:47.458
(Deon sighs)

16:47.458 --> 16:48.916
- Where did you get that gun?

16:49.750 --> 16:52.166
- I bought it a couple weeks ago.

16:52.166 --> 16:54.916
- Okay, well, we gotta return it.

16:54.916 --> 16:56.000
- What?

16:56.000 --> 16:57.041
No.
- Yeah.

16:57.041 --> 16:58.625
- It saved us, didn't it?

16:58.625 --> 17:00.708
- Yeah, Bri, but you know the law, okay?

17:00.708 --> 17:01.958
You know the law.

17:03.541 --> 17:06.750
- Look, I don't feel safe without it now.

17:06.750 --> 17:09.915
People are carrying swords and knives.

17:09.915 --> 17:12.125
You saw the person with the bow and arrow.

17:12.125 --> 17:13.958
We don't know how to use that shit.

17:16.665 --> 17:18.833
I can't even put it in my purse.

17:20.708 --> 17:22.208
- Look, I get it, okay,

17:22.208 --> 17:25.000
and look, I know how you feel,

17:25.000 --> 17:28.000
but if someone attacks you, okay,

17:28.000 --> 17:29.791
and you shoot them back,

17:29.791 --> 17:32.541
it's not considered self-defense anymore.

17:32.541 --> 17:34.750
- Well, at least I'll be alive.

17:37.041 --> 17:38.500
- [Deon] I get it.

17:38.500 --> 17:41.333
Look, Bri, we'll just find
you something else to carry.

17:41.333 --> 17:42.666
- Like what?

17:42.666 --> 17:44.541
I can't even carry a taser.

17:44.541 --> 17:46.041
Trust me, I looked.

17:46.041 --> 17:49.083
That's why I bought the
gun in the first place.

17:49.083 --> 17:50.333
And they still have the nerve

17:50.333 --> 17:52.208
to call this the land of the free?

17:53.500 --> 17:55.833
It's not even just these guns.

17:55.833 --> 17:59.375
It's this curfew, and this yuan shit.

18:01.416 --> 18:02.833
When is it gonna end?

18:04.000 --> 18:05.875
This government is supposed to help us,

18:05.875 --> 18:08.208
it's supposed to work with us.

18:08.208 --> 18:10.791
It's not supposed to dictate us.

18:12.750 --> 18:15.333
- You right, you are right,

18:15.333 --> 18:17.041
but what are we gonna do?

18:17.041 --> 18:17.875
- I don't know.

18:18.875 --> 18:21.583
Why run a country and not even care

18:21.583 --> 18:23.208
about the people that are in it?

18:24.166 --> 18:25.916
This is just frustrating.

18:25.916 --> 18:28.583
Like, we work 40 to 60 hours a week,

18:28.583 --> 18:32.333
and this lazy ass nigga
runs up and robs us.

18:32.333 --> 18:35.458
Like, he's lucky I just
didn't shoot his dumb ass.

18:37.166 --> 18:38.625
- Were you really gonna shoot him?

18:38.625 --> 18:42.333
- Yes, he had a knife to your throat.

18:42.333 --> 18:43.666
Of course I would've.

18:49.291 --> 18:50.833
Do you think the police would come sit

18:50.833 --> 18:52.083
with us while we wait?

18:53.083 --> 18:55.541
- Nah, nah, I doubt it.

18:56.666 --> 18:58.000
I mean, but you never know.

18:59.125 --> 19:01.625
(phone rings)

19:09.416 --> 19:12.250
- [Responder] 911, what's the
address of your emergency?

19:12.250 --> 19:15.958
- Hi, me and my boyfriend
are waiting for a tow,

19:15.958 --> 19:18.750
and some guy just tried to rob us.

19:18.750 --> 19:22.208
Is there any way you could
please send a police officer

19:22.208 --> 19:24.583
just to come sit with us while we waited,

19:24.583 --> 19:26.666
or maybe even check on us?

19:26.666 --> 19:29.083
- [Responder] Okay, we can
send someone to check on you,

19:29.083 --> 19:30.958
but they can't stay.

19:30.958 --> 19:32.125
What is your location?

19:32.125 --> 19:37.125
- Okay, well, we're on 15th
Street right off of Warren.

19:37.208 --> 19:38.791
- [Responder] And what
type of vehicle is it?

19:38.791 --> 19:40.583
- Yeah, we're in a silver SUV.

19:40.583 --> 19:42.125
You can't miss us.

19:42.125 --> 19:43.625
- [Responder] Okay,
ma'am, just hang tight.

19:43.625 --> 19:45.458
I'll send someone out as soon as possible.

19:45.458 --> 19:46.708
- Okay, thank you.

19:56.208 --> 19:58.958
- Look, let's just take our
mind off of all this, okay?

20:00.166 --> 20:01.291
I got something for us.

20:07.125 --> 20:10.041
(soft R&B music)

- Dang, babe.

21:57.208 --> 22:00.041
- [Deon] Man, this is good.

22:00.041 --> 22:02.166
- Do you guys mind if I jump in the back?

22:03.458 --> 22:04.291
- [Deon] Didn't your parents teach you

22:04.291 --> 22:05.583
not to get in the car with strangers?

22:05.583 --> 22:09.166
- Well, yeah, but I have a
positive vibe about you guys.

22:09.166 --> 22:11.291
Usually, I can tell when
bad people are around,

22:11.291 --> 22:12.916
and there's a lot around here.

22:12.916 --> 22:14.583
- [Deon] Yeah, we noticed.

22:14.583 --> 22:15.458
All right, hop in the back, bro.

22:15.458 --> 22:16.916
- Aight, cool.

22:23.750 --> 22:24.958
- So where are you from?

22:24.958 --> 22:26.000
You stay around here?

22:27.041 --> 22:29.208
- Yeah, not too far up the road.

22:30.166 --> 22:33.250
- [Deon] Mm, that was some good pizza.

22:33.250 --> 22:34.875
Yo, where did you get this from?

22:34.875 --> 22:36.750
- I got it from my uncle Will's shop.

22:38.500 --> 22:42.041
Hm, so, you have any sisters

22:42.041 --> 22:44.083
or cousins around my age?

22:44.083 --> 22:46.833
(Bri laughs)
- Mm, okay.

22:46.833 --> 22:48.375
- No, why?

22:50.375 --> 22:52.541
- I was trying to get lucky today.

22:52.541 --> 22:54.416
You know, I'm ready for a wife.

22:54.416 --> 22:56.458
- Come on, man, you
ready for a wife already?

22:56.458 --> 22:59.083
- Heck yeah, I'm trying to get lucky, man.

22:59.083 --> 23:01.541
- [Deon] (chuckles) I
don't blame you, man.

23:01.541 --> 23:05.541
- But she has to love
video games or it's over.

23:05.541 --> 23:07.291
- A man who knows what he wants.

23:07.291 --> 23:09.000
Look at you.

23:09.000 --> 23:11.458
- Mm-hm, I just want to come home,

23:11.458 --> 23:13.416
eat pizza, play video games,

23:13.416 --> 23:15.083
no arguing, no fighting.

23:15.083 --> 23:17.541
I just want to have a cool life.

23:17.541 --> 23:18.541
- [Deon] And that's it.

23:18.541 --> 23:19.375
- That's it.

23:20.875 --> 23:22.041
- So, besides video games,

23:22.041 --> 23:24.750
like, is there anything
else you like to do, man?

23:24.750 --> 23:26.666
- Mm, well, no.

23:26.666 --> 23:29.250
My grandfather told me to do what I love

23:29.250 --> 23:30.458
and make sure I can make money off of it.

23:30.458 --> 23:33.291
- You're a lot smarter
than most adults I know.

23:33.291 --> 23:34.125
- Mm-hm.

23:35.750 --> 23:37.458
Man, I agree with you 100%.

23:37.458 --> 23:39.625
I hate my job.

23:39.625 --> 23:41.791
- So what do you do?

23:41.791 --> 23:43.791
- [Deon] Man, I work at a plant.

23:43.791 --> 23:46.125
I manage their work orders
and stuff like that.

23:47.333 --> 23:48.666
- Sounds boring.

23:48.666 --> 23:49.500
- [Deon] It is.

23:50.625 --> 23:52.541
- What do you really want to do?

23:53.458 --> 23:55.291
- I just want freedom, you know?

23:55.291 --> 23:57.125
Freedom to do whatever I want

23:57.125 --> 23:58.750
when I want, how I want.

23:59.833 --> 24:01.625
- [Darius] How you plan on getting it?

24:01.625 --> 24:02.875
- That I do not know.

24:04.666 --> 24:06.666
- Well, you have to find
your passion in life.

24:06.666 --> 24:07.708
That's the key.

24:07.708 --> 24:08.833
Then you'll be good.

24:10.375 --> 24:11.333
- [Deon] Yeah, you know, you right.

24:11.333 --> 24:12.916
- Mm-hm, what about you?

24:12.916 --> 24:16.875
- Well, I really want to be a writer.

24:16.875 --> 24:21.875
I love to write, but I never
have time for it anymore.

24:22.041 --> 24:23.458
- Well, you have to make time,

24:23.458 --> 24:25.208
even if it's just an hour a day.

24:29.333 --> 24:30.166
- You're right.

24:31.750 --> 24:34.166
- Mm, can I see your phone?

24:34.166 --> 24:35.000
- Yeah, go ahead.

24:41.041 --> 24:42.666
- [Darius] Hm, here, just in case

24:42.666 --> 24:43.875
you guys need to hit me up,

24:43.875 --> 24:45.583
just give me a call.

24:45.583 --> 24:46.875
- All right, for sure.

24:46.875 --> 24:49.000
- [Bri] You something else.

24:49.000 --> 24:51.416
- Yeah, that's what they all say.

24:51.416 --> 24:52.583
Text me when your tow come.

24:52.583 --> 24:53.708
- Will do.

24:53.708 --> 24:55.750
Thanks so much for your help.

24:55.750 --> 24:56.791
- It was my pleasure.

24:57.750 --> 24:59.125
(Bri laughs)

24:59.125 --> 25:00.166
- Smart kid.

25:03.041 --> 25:03.875
Mm.

25:04.791 --> 25:06.333
Now I know one thing,

25:06.333 --> 25:08.333
I'm coming back here just for the pizza.

25:09.625 --> 25:11.541
Mm, that's my second slice.

25:11.541 --> 25:13.541
(phone rings)

25:13.541 --> 25:16.083
(soft orchestral music)

25:16.083 --> 25:18.625
- [Operator] Thank you for

25:25.125 --> 25:26.458
This is Sarah speaking.

25:26.458 --> 25:27.916
How can I direct your call?

25:27.916 --> 25:30.041
- Hi, Sarah, how you doing today?

25:30.041 --> 25:32.958
- [Sarah] I'm doing well,
sir, how about yourself?

25:32.958 --> 25:34.750
- Still breathing, so I can't complain.

25:34.750 --> 25:37.666
- [Sarah] That's a good outlook to have.

25:37.666 --> 25:39.666
So how can I direct your call?

25:39.666 --> 25:41.166
- Can I have you transfer me

25:41.166 --> 25:43.250

25:43.250 --> 25:44.875
- [Sarah] Sure, one moment, sir.

25:44.875 --> 25:46.666
- Thank you so much.

Finally get transferred to a human.

25:52.041 --> 25:54.041

26:03.375 --> 26:06.083
- Do y'all provide
loaner cars to customers?

26:06.083 --> 26:07.541
- [Aaron] Yes, sir, we do.

26:07.541 --> 26:10.000
Would you like to schedule an appointment?

26:10.000 --> 26:11.833
- Well, we waiting for a tow.

26:11.833 --> 26:13.083
We been here for a while.

26:14.375 --> 26:15.666
- [Aaron] Aw, sorry to hear that.

26:15.666 --> 26:17.583
What's wrong with the vehicle?

26:17.583 --> 26:18.916
- Well, the car won't start,

26:18.916 --> 26:21.666
and I got a error message on my odometer.

26:21.666 --> 26:23.083
- [Aaron] You're, like, the third person

26:23.083 --> 26:25.625
to call me this week with the same issue.

26:25.625 --> 26:26.458
- What?

26:27.916 --> 26:30.125
- [Aaron] But none of them ever showed up.

26:30.125 --> 26:32.416
Maybe it fixes itself, but yeah,

26:32.416 --> 26:33.458
just bring it on in.

26:33.458 --> 26:34.916
We're open 'til 6:00.

26:34.916 --> 26:36.791
- Wonderful, thank you so much.

26:36.791 --> 26:38.333
- [Aaron] Not a problem.

26:38.333 --> 26:39.250
- All right.

26:39.250 --> 26:40.250
- [Aaron] See you then.

26:42.000 --> 26:43.916
(Deon sighs)

26:43.916 --> 26:46.250
- Look, I hope they have
some good loaner cars

26:46.250 --> 26:47.708
'cause I'm not trying to show up

26:47.708 --> 26:49.750
like Jim Carrey off "The Mask."

26:49.750 --> 26:50.583
(phone buzzes)

26:50.583 --> 26:51.833
- That's my mom.

26:55.875 --> 26:56.916
Hey, Ma.

26:56.916 --> 26:59.333
- [Mom] Deon, why are they telling me

26:59.333 --> 27:00.791
your car is not running?

27:03.000 --> 27:04.541
- Because it won't start.

27:04.541 --> 27:06.208
- [Mom] I am about to call corporate,

27:06.208 --> 27:09.166
and cuss they ass out,
and get you a new car.

27:09.166 --> 27:11.500
- Come on, Ma, that's not necessary.

27:11.500 --> 27:13.041
- [Mom] The hell it ain't.

27:13.041 --> 27:14.541
As much as that car cost,

27:14.541 --> 27:16.541
there is no reason for this.

27:16.541 --> 27:18.041
- Mom, I got it under control.

27:19.291 --> 27:20.458
- [Mom] Mm-hm, you sure?

27:21.916 --> 27:22.750
- Yes.

27:24.083 --> 27:26.875
- [Mom] Fine, this is your
brother's big day now,

27:26.875 --> 27:28.125
you better not miss it.

27:28.125 --> 27:29.083
- And I won't, Mom.

27:30.416 --> 27:32.833
- [Mom] All right, now,
I'll see you soon then.

27:32.833 --> 27:34.291
- Okay, okay.

27:35.416 --> 27:36.958
Bye, Mom.

27:36.958 --> 27:37.916
- [Mom] Mm-hm, bye.

27:40.750 --> 27:43.208
(traffic whirs)

27:43.208 --> 27:45.708
(eerie music)

27:53.750 --> 27:56.583
(car door closes)

28:09.041 --> 28:10.833
- How you folks doing?

28:10.833 --> 28:13.000
- Good, how are you, officer?

28:13.000 --> 28:13.958
- Good.

28:13.958 --> 28:15.708
License and registration, please.

28:18.041 --> 28:19.125
- Why?

28:19.125 --> 28:21.208
- License and registration, please.

28:21.208 --> 28:22.750
Don't make me ask a third time.

28:27.500 --> 28:28.750
- It's in my pocket.

28:28.750 --> 28:29.583
- Go for it.

28:37.583 --> 28:39.291
Take it out of the wallet, please.

28:48.416 --> 28:49.625
And the registration.

28:58.000 --> 28:58.875
Yours too.

28:59.958 --> 29:01.125
- Yours too what?

29:02.000 --> 29:03.541
- Wait, she not even driving.

29:03.541 --> 29:05.000
- Your identification, ma'am.

29:07.250 --> 29:09.291
- But she's not driving.

29:09.291 --> 29:10.125
- It's fine.

29:21.541 --> 29:23.583
- Where are you folks heading?

29:23.583 --> 29:24.833
- To a wedding.

29:24.833 --> 29:25.708
- A wedding, huh?

29:27.375 --> 29:30.083
- Excuse me, officer, we were
the ones that called you.

29:30.083 --> 29:31.750
We were waiting for a tow,

29:31.750 --> 29:34.000
and someone tried to rob us.

29:34.000 --> 29:36.833
- Yeah, that's kinda normal around here.

29:36.833 --> 29:38.000
You folks look okay.

29:38.000 --> 29:39.375
Did they get anything?

29:39.375 --> 29:40.875
- No, we talked him out of it.

29:41.750 --> 29:44.958
- That's impressive you can
reason with these people.

29:44.958 --> 29:47.333
- What do you mean, this people?

29:47.333 --> 29:48.416
- No-good criminals.

29:50.416 --> 29:51.875
I need you to pop your trunk.

29:53.583 --> 29:54.416
- What?

29:55.791 --> 29:57.291
- This is a high drug area,

29:57.291 --> 29:59.375
I need to be sure you're not dealing.

29:59.375 --> 30:00.500
- What?

30:00.500 --> 30:02.958
Look, man, I told you
we ain't dealing, okay?

30:02.958 --> 30:04.958
We told you we just going to a wedding.

30:04.958 --> 30:06.541
Shit, we the one that called you.

30:06.541 --> 30:08.291
- No need to raise your voice, sir.

30:10.375 --> 30:12.916
- I'm not raising my voice, officer.

30:12.916 --> 30:13.875
- Yes, you did.

30:20.041 --> 30:22.125
- We not dealing, officer.

30:23.291 --> 30:24.208
- Then you shouldn't have a problem

30:24.208 --> 30:25.750
with me searching your vehicle.

30:27.458 --> 30:29.416
- You not searching my
vehicle without a warrant.

30:29.416 --> 30:30.791
(officer laughs)

30:30.791 --> 30:33.583
- What do you think this is, 2019?

30:33.583 --> 30:35.416
We have the right to search any car,

30:35.416 --> 30:38.375
house, or person we deem suspicious,

30:38.375 --> 30:39.875
and right now, that's you.

30:41.750 --> 30:43.625
- Babe, just do what he says.

30:45.000 --> 30:45.833
Come on.

30:45.833 --> 30:47.541
- You should listen to your woman.

30:50.333 --> 30:51.166
- It's open.

30:52.291 --> 30:53.708
Make sure you pop the latch.

31:06.666 --> 31:08.250
The gun.

31:08.250 --> 31:10.291
- I know, but we can't put it anywhere.

31:29.958 --> 31:32.625
(clears throat)

31:38.958 --> 31:40.958
(spits)

31:42.291 --> 31:43.791
- [Officer] Are you all right, ma'am?

31:43.791 --> 31:46.166
- Yes, I'm good, officer.

31:46.166 --> 31:48.125
Just morning sickness.

31:50.000 --> 31:52.666
- All right, I need you both
to step out of the vehicle

31:52.666 --> 31:53.625
and up on the curb.

32:05.958 --> 32:07.208
Stand over here, please.

32:11.500 --> 32:13.541
Keep your hands out where I can see them.

32:14.500 --> 32:16.208
Right there, sir, back up.

32:18.875 --> 32:20.125
Good boy, stay there.

32:30.500 --> 32:32.666
That's the deepest console I've ever seen.

32:40.583 --> 32:41.833
- Is all this necessary?

32:42.708 --> 32:43.875
- Can never be too safe.

32:57.416 --> 32:59.250
Sir, can you step over here, please?

33:02.583 --> 33:05.166
Stand up straight, put your
hands out to your sides.

33:19.458 --> 33:22.166
All right, you're good, stand over there.

33:22.166 --> 33:23.000
You're next.

33:54.083 --> 33:57.166
(Deon clears throat)

33:58.291 --> 34:01.375
(Deon clears throat)

34:02.958 --> 34:04.208
- You done?

34:04.208 --> 34:05.916
- Yeah, you're good.

34:05.916 --> 34:06.791
Step over there.

34:10.541 --> 34:12.875
Do I understand you two
are looking for a tow?

34:13.916 --> 34:15.041
- Yes.

34:15.041 --> 34:17.666
- I can have a guy here
in about five minutes.

34:17.666 --> 34:18.500
- For free?

34:19.583 --> 34:21.083
- Nothing's for free, darling.

34:26.291 --> 34:28.083
- No, we're fine.

34:30.458 --> 34:31.708
- 'Cause I like you guys,

34:32.791 --> 34:35.083
I could do it for, say, 200 yuan.

34:36.875 --> 34:39.333
- You're seriously asking
us for money right now?

34:40.708 --> 34:43.458
- Hey, you need a tow, I got a guy.

34:43.458 --> 34:44.875
We could help each other out.

34:44.875 --> 34:47.500
- No, no thank you.

34:47.500 --> 34:48.333
- You're sure?

34:48.333 --> 34:49.375
- Did he stutter?

34:50.791 --> 34:51.625
- Tell you what.

34:56.041 --> 34:57.500
Here's one of my cards.

34:57.500 --> 34:59.500
If you change your mind, give me a call.

35:00.416 --> 35:02.250
(paper tears)

35:02.250 --> 35:04.291
- Have a nice day, officer.

35:06.708 --> 35:08.291
- That's how it's gonna be, huh?

35:09.458 --> 35:11.583
Okay, catch you next time.

35:27.625 --> 35:30.541
(car engine whirs)

35:34.291 --> 35:36.791
(eerie music)

35:40.583 --> 35:42.750
- I hope he didn't touch our shit.

35:42.750 --> 35:45.791
Babe, look, our stuff is everywhere.

35:45.791 --> 35:46.625
- What?

35:47.583 --> 35:48.416
Seriously?

35:51.333 --> 35:54.166
- No, he didn't.
- What?

35:54.166 --> 35:55.375
What?

35:55.375 --> 35:58.083
- I bought some panties for
tonight, and they're missing.

35:58.083 --> 35:58.958
- What?

35:58.958 --> 36:01.583
(Bri groans)

36:01.583 --> 36:03.166
- He had the nerve to violate me

36:03.166 --> 36:05.458
and then steal my panties?

36:05.458 --> 36:07.583
If I would've put my shoe in his ass,

36:07.583 --> 36:09.083
I would've been sent to jail,

36:09.083 --> 36:10.833
and he knows he's in the wrong.

36:15.125 --> 36:17.958
I swear, if this tow truck
doesn't hit this corner soon.

36:34.333 --> 36:35.416
- [Deon] Bae.

36:36.708 --> 36:37.916
Bae.

36:37.916 --> 36:38.958
Come back here.

36:47.916 --> 36:49.541
- I'm just over today.

36:49.541 --> 36:50.375
- [Deon] Huh?

36:50.375 --> 36:53.166
- I'm just over today.

36:53.166 --> 36:55.625
- Yeah, I know, you and me both.

36:57.291 --> 36:59.875
- All this stress isn't
good for me and the bab--

37:02.250 --> 37:03.041
- What?

37:04.791 --> 37:06.291
You and the what?

37:06.291 --> 37:07.166
- Nothing.

37:09.875 --> 37:11.833
It's just not good for me.

37:17.833 --> 37:18.666
- Brianna.

37:22.083 --> 37:22.916
Brianna.

37:25.958 --> 37:26.833
Are you pregnant?

37:30.416 --> 37:32.083
- Yes.

37:32.083 --> 37:32.916
Yes, I am.

37:36.458 --> 37:37.583
(Deon sighs)

37:37.583 --> 37:38.416
Deon.

37:41.958 --> 37:42.791
Deon.

37:44.750 --> 37:47.708
You don't want it, do you?

37:47.708 --> 37:48.541
- What?

37:50.416 --> 37:52.583
- You don't want this baby, do you?

37:55.333 --> 37:57.166
No, you don't want it.

37:57.166 --> 37:59.625
- Bri, Bri.

37:59.625 --> 38:00.458
Oh, shit.

38:03.541 --> 38:04.916
Bri, hold on for a second.

38:04.916 --> 38:05.750
- No.

38:05.750 --> 38:07.166
- Hold on, come here.

38:07.166 --> 38:09.000
What are you talking about?

38:09.000 --> 38:11.916
- You always say you
don't want another baby.

38:13.250 --> 38:16.041
Why would I think you'd
be happy with this one?

38:16.041 --> 38:18.583
- Look, I ain't want a
girlfriend either, okay?

38:18.583 --> 38:20.708
But you the best thing
that ever happened to me.

38:23.500 --> 38:24.958
- You did fight liking me

38:24.958 --> 38:26.541
for, like, the longest.

38:26.541 --> 38:27.708
- Yeah, I did.

38:29.500 --> 38:31.541
You the best thing that
ever happened to me.

38:34.250 --> 38:35.125
- I better be.

38:36.375 --> 38:38.583
- Remember that time
we went to Cedar Point?

38:40.000 --> 38:41.125
- How could I forget?

38:44.333 --> 38:47.125
I was so sure I was gonna
get pregnant that day.

38:51.541 --> 38:55.375
- You know, I think
sometimes, I wish you had.

38:56.583 --> 38:58.083
- Really?

38:58.083 --> 38:59.541
Why?

38:59.541 --> 39:01.791
- Because I don't want
to deal with Danielle.

39:04.416 --> 39:07.958
I honestly feel, if it
was just me and you,

39:09.000 --> 39:10.125
we would be better off.

39:12.958 --> 39:14.875
I mean, you having your first child.

39:15.875 --> 39:17.333
You know how special that is?

39:18.541 --> 39:21.458
And I ruined it with someone
I don't even care about.

39:22.291 --> 39:24.166
- I didn't know you felt that way.

39:25.458 --> 39:26.333
- I didn't either.

39:29.791 --> 39:32.750
When I first met you, back in high school,

39:33.833 --> 39:35.291
I was drawn into you.

39:36.625 --> 39:38.291
That was 15 years ago.

39:40.875 --> 39:44.500
My nose is still wide open for you, okay?

39:45.500 --> 39:48.208
So yes, I do want this baby.

39:51.000 --> 39:51.958
I love you, Bri.

39:54.791 --> 39:55.833
- I love you too.

40:04.500 --> 40:05.583
- All right?

40:05.583 --> 40:06.875
Let's get back in the car.

40:27.750 --> 40:28.875
Hey, B.

40:28.875 --> 40:29.708
- [Bri] Yeah?

40:32.041 --> 40:33.458
- You're gonna be a great mom.

40:35.083 --> 40:36.958
- Aw, thank you.

40:36.958 --> 40:39.041
I already know you're gonna be a good dad.

40:42.583 --> 40:44.458
- Hey, I wonder what we gonna name him.

40:44.458 --> 40:45.791
- [Bri] Or her.

40:45.791 --> 40:47.083
- Yeah, you right, or her.

40:48.583 --> 40:49.416
- I don't know.

40:49.416 --> 40:52.291
If it's a boy, I like Alexander.

40:53.625 --> 40:58.000
If it's a girl, I like Nile, Nile River.

40:58.000 --> 40:58.958
- Nile River?

40:58.958 --> 41:00.250
- [Bri] Yeah.

41:00.250 --> 41:01.083
- What?

41:01.083 --> 41:02.041
Where'd you get that name from?

41:02.041 --> 41:03.125
- It's cute.

41:03.125 --> 41:05.750
- [Deon] No, it's not, that's a bad name.

41:05.750 --> 41:08.958
You're fired from ever
naming our child's names.

41:08.958 --> 41:09.791
- Fired?

41:09.791 --> 41:10.625
- [Deon] Yes.

41:10.625 --> 41:11.458
- You can't fire me.

41:11.458 --> 41:13.333
- I just did, you're fired.

41:13.333 --> 41:16.375
I don't care how cute
you are, you're fired.

41:16.375 --> 41:18.750
- [Bri] Whatever, do you
have any better ideas?

41:20.000 --> 41:23.500
- All right, if it's a boy,

41:25.791 --> 41:27.208
we gonna name him Roshaun,

41:28.250 --> 41:29.291
but if it's a girl,

41:31.125 --> 41:32.291
we'll name her Roshaun.

41:33.250 --> 41:34.791
(both laugh)

41:34.791 --> 41:35.625
- Whatever.

41:36.625 --> 41:38.208
You're no better at this than I am.

41:38.208 --> 41:39.041
- Whatever.

41:42.166 --> 41:44.083
Wonder what time it is.

41:47.083 --> 41:49.916
Think I should call the tow truck,

41:49.916 --> 41:51.083
see where he at?

41:51.083 --> 41:52.166
- [Bri] Yeah.

41:54.250 --> 41:55.708
- Yeah, it's about that time.

42:00.333 --> 42:02.833
(phone rings)

42:08.250 --> 42:09.916
- [Secretary] Hello?

42:09.916 --> 42:11.166
- Is this Brown's Towing?

42:12.791 --> 42:13.833
- [Secretary] Yes, it is.

42:13.833 --> 42:15.541
How can I help you?

42:15.541 --> 42:17.958
- Yeah, I'm calling to check
on the status of a tow.

42:19.208 --> 42:21.041
- [Secretary] Didn't they give you an ETA?

42:21.958 --> 42:22.791
- Yeah.

42:23.875 --> 42:26.833
- [Secretary] Then that's the
time they should be arriving.

42:27.708 --> 42:30.291
- Well, can you tell me a
time that they're coming?

42:30.291 --> 42:32.458
- [Secretary] All of our
trucks are very busy.

42:33.750 --> 42:35.833
Anything else I can help you with?

42:35.833 --> 42:38.875
- Will you please give
me a time they're coming?

42:38.875 --> 42:40.333
I would gladly appreciate it.

42:41.833 --> 42:43.333
- [Secretary] Fine.

42:43.333 --> 42:44.166
Name?

42:44.166 --> 42:46.375
- Deon Harris, Silver Equinox.

42:47.833 --> 42:50.208
- [Secretary] They should
be there around 5:00 p.m.

42:50.208 --> 42:51.625
- 5:00 p.m.?

42:51.625 --> 42:54.583
I thought you said they'd
be here at 4:30, 4:35.

42:54.583 --> 42:56.958
- [Secretary] I don't know,
I just answer the phone.

42:56.958 --> 42:58.750
Our times are just an estimate,

42:58.750 --> 42:59.625
which is what the E--

42:59.625 --> 43:00.625
- Shut the hell up.

43:02.750 --> 43:05.750
- Who pissed in her corn
flakes this morning?

43:05.750 --> 43:07.625
- She probably single with seven cats.

43:09.041 --> 43:11.625
(phone buzzes)

43:14.041 --> 43:15.083
What up, Tay?

43:15.083 --> 43:16.875
- [Tay] Yo, what up?

43:16.875 --> 43:17.875
- Yeah, they said that
tow truck won't be here

43:17.875 --> 43:19.625
'til about five o'clock.

43:19.625 --> 43:21.875
- [Tay] Damn, so, if they come at 5:00,

43:21.875 --> 43:24.416
you should make it by 6:00 or so, right?

43:24.416 --> 43:25.541
- Yeah, we hope so.

43:25.541 --> 43:27.583
- [Tay] All right, man,
well, we can make it work.

43:27.583 --> 43:28.708
See you then.

43:31.833 --> 43:35.250
(eerie orchestral music)

44:01.500 --> 44:04.083
(window whirs)

44:34.958 --> 44:37.750
(Rhea taps on window)

44:37.750 --> 44:39.291
- How y'all doing?

44:39.291 --> 44:41.500
Would you mind stepping
out of the vehicle?

44:44.291 --> 44:47.041
(taps on window)

44:57.291 --> 44:59.083
(window whirs)

44:59.083 --> 44:59.916
- What do you want?

44:59.916 --> 45:02.416
- We want you to step out of the vehicle.

45:02.416 --> 45:04.250
Didn't I just say that?

45:04.250 --> 45:05.625
Did I stutter?

45:05.625 --> 45:08.041
- Nope, heard you loud and clear.

45:08.041 --> 45:09.083
- I thought so.

45:09.916 --> 45:11.541
- We called the police.

45:11.541 --> 45:13.166
They should be here any minute.

45:13.166 --> 45:15.750
(clowns laugh)

45:17.958 --> 45:19.583
- Nice try.

45:19.583 --> 45:21.791
Either you get out of the vehicle,

45:21.791 --> 45:24.166
or we make you get out of the vehicle.

45:25.000 --> 45:26.250
Your choice.

45:27.666 --> 45:29.000
Go get me a rag.

45:31.791 --> 45:33.166
So, where y'all from?

45:34.375 --> 45:36.625
Oh, silent type, are we?

45:36.625 --> 45:39.750
Well, me, I'm from Tennessee.

45:39.750 --> 45:41.333
I used to want to be a singer,

45:41.333 --> 45:43.166
but it didn't pan out for me

45:43.166 --> 45:46.125
'cause it turns out, I
really couldn't sing,

45:46.125 --> 45:48.041
but I did have a favorite song.

45:48.041 --> 45:49.041
You want to hear it?

45:50.375 --> 45:54.333
♪ She used to cry when I came home late ♪

45:54.333 --> 45:58.291
♪ Now she just cries when I come home ♪

45:58.291 --> 45:59.125
Light it.

46:00.041 --> 46:03.250
Looks like we're gonna
have ourselves a pig roast.

46:03.250 --> 46:05.083
Step back everybody.

46:05.083 --> 46:08.333
Looks like the Fourth of
July's coming early this year.

46:11.541 --> 46:13.791
Get out of the fucking car.

46:23.333 --> 46:28.250
Now, why did you make us
go through all of this?

46:28.250 --> 46:31.541
This could've been a whole lot easier.

46:31.541 --> 46:32.875
- What do you want, huh?

46:33.750 --> 46:34.583
Money?

46:35.708 --> 46:38.916
Here, you can have it,
just leave us alone.

46:38.916 --> 46:41.083
- Could've handed that to him nicely.

46:42.666 --> 46:44.791
- You took the words
right out of my mouth.

46:46.500 --> 46:48.750
- Are you serious?

46:48.750 --> 46:52.791
You're supposed to protect
and serve us, not torture us.

46:55.041 --> 46:57.083
- If you two weren't so disrespectful,

46:57.083 --> 46:59.541
this could've went a whole nother way.

46:59.541 --> 47:01.041
- Disrespectful?

47:01.041 --> 47:04.041
You sexually harassed
my wife in front of me,

47:06.250 --> 47:07.625
and you took her underwear,

47:08.541 --> 47:11.541
and you got the audacity
to call us disrespectful?

47:12.958 --> 47:14.708
- What I did earlier,

47:14.708 --> 47:18.916
I just did it to harass
you, to provoke you.

47:18.916 --> 47:20.041
- Mm-hm.

47:20.041 --> 47:21.250
- So that's what you do?

47:22.708 --> 47:26.250
You go around harassing
black folks, is that it?

47:27.291 --> 47:32.166
- No, some very rich and very
powerful people want you.

47:32.166 --> 47:33.458
- [Deon] For what?

47:33.458 --> 47:35.958
- You know, when you renew
your driver's license,

47:35.958 --> 47:38.666
and there's that little check
about donating an organ?

47:38.666 --> 47:39.500
- [Deon] Yeah.

47:39.500 --> 47:40.333
- Well, when you checked yes,

47:40.333 --> 47:42.625
it put you on a special list,

47:42.625 --> 47:45.833
a list only very powerful
people have access to,

47:45.833 --> 47:48.541
and one of them needs, let's say, a heart,

47:48.541 --> 47:51.458
and they're AB-positive, like yourself,

47:51.458 --> 47:53.958
they send someone to go get it,

47:53.958 --> 47:56.250
and in this case, that someone is me.

47:58.833 --> 48:00.916
Sometimes, we arrange for a car accident.

48:03.083 --> 48:04.791
Sometimes, some gym mats will just

48:04.791 --> 48:06.333
accidentally fall on someone.

48:07.500 --> 48:09.958
Or cars just stop where we want them.

48:10.875 --> 48:13.250
- So you telling me you stalled out my car

48:13.250 --> 48:14.416
just to take my heart?

48:15.333 --> 48:17.333
Are you guys serious?

48:17.333 --> 48:18.958
Is this a joke?

48:18.958 --> 48:22.291
- 911, what's the
address of the emergency?

48:22.291 --> 48:23.583
- That was you?

48:23.583 --> 48:24.666
- Yep.

48:24.666 --> 48:28.500
Damn, ma, your skin soft as fuck.

48:28.500 --> 48:30.208
- [Clown] And she slim thick too?

48:30.208 --> 48:33.166
- Shit, bitch is slim thick though.

48:33.166 --> 48:34.875
- Don't take it personal.

48:34.875 --> 48:36.583
My son's in the hospital,

48:36.583 --> 48:38.750
and protecting and serving the law,

48:38.750 --> 48:41.291
it sounds good, but in reality,

48:41.291 --> 48:42.916
it don't pay jack shit.

48:44.375 --> 48:48.375
I want wealth, I want the
freedom that wealth brings.

48:48.375 --> 48:50.916
I'm tired of getting shot at for crumbs

48:50.916 --> 48:52.916
while my son's lying in a hospital,

48:54.083 --> 48:56.916
and you, my friend, are the key.

48:56.916 --> 49:00.416
- Purpose of a man, to
make everything better.

49:00.416 --> 49:03.041
What are you doing to make this better?

49:03.041 --> 49:05.500
- Blah, blah-blah-blah.

49:05.500 --> 49:06.333
I don't need to hear any

49:06.333 --> 49:08.958
of your motivational mumbo-jumbo.

49:08.958 --> 49:11.333
As long as my son can get
the care that he needs,

49:11.333 --> 49:14.291
and I can retire, I don't care.

49:14.291 --> 49:15.500
- You're sick.

49:17.708 --> 49:18.875
- Hm.

49:18.875 --> 49:21.375
- You know what'd be great with you two?

49:21.375 --> 49:22.750
- What's that?

49:22.750 --> 49:25.833
- X-Art, that would be so hot.

49:25.833 --> 49:26.833
- Hell yeah.

49:27.833 --> 49:29.000
- I'm down.

49:30.708 --> 49:32.500
You interested?

49:32.500 --> 49:34.958
Mm, that's a face I can sit on.

49:42.500 --> 49:43.750
- Sit still.

49:43.750 --> 49:45.291
(gun fires)

49:45.291 --> 49:46.708
- Yeah, now what?

49:47.583 --> 49:49.416
- Well, that escalated quickly.

49:50.416 --> 49:52.750
You two are full of surprises.

49:52.750 --> 49:55.416
I searched your vehicle,
and I didn't see that.

49:55.416 --> 49:57.875
Hell, I can't even leave
the precinct with a gun.

49:59.458 --> 50:01.250
What are you gonna do?

50:01.250 --> 50:03.625
- Nobody controls me, okay?

50:03.625 --> 50:08.541
Nobody, so you got one
option, to let her go, now.

50:09.875 --> 50:10.791
- Oh, really?

50:12.041 --> 50:14.916
Sweetheart, if he fires another shot,

50:15.875 --> 50:17.750
I want you to cut her throat.

50:17.750 --> 50:19.208
- With pleasure.

50:22.958 --> 50:25.500
- Now, you need to give me that gun,

50:25.500 --> 50:26.875
or pop goes the weasel.

50:29.541 --> 50:31.583
You seem to be struggling,

50:31.583 --> 50:33.041
so let me help you out a bit.

50:34.166 --> 50:35.583
I'm gonna count to four,

50:37.125 --> 50:39.958
and when I get to four,
she's gonna kill her.

50:46.625 --> 50:50.375
(speaks in foreign language)

50:52.958 --> 50:55.333
How do you say four in German?

50:55.333 --> 50:57.291
(Rhea speaks in foreign language)

50:57.291 --> 50:58.625
I like how that sounds.

51:00.291 --> 51:01.416
I knew you were smart.

51:04.958 --> 51:06.125
All right, come on.

51:11.541 --> 51:12.375
Turn around.

51:13.541 --> 51:14.708
Hands behind your head.

51:18.333 --> 51:20.041
(clown grunts)

51:20.041 --> 51:21.583
Are you just gonna sit around all day,

51:21.583 --> 51:23.333
or are you gonna join us?

51:23.333 --> 51:24.208
- Fuck you.

51:25.583 --> 51:26.875
- Not too tight, are they?

51:30.041 --> 51:33.166
You ever hear the song "I Left
My Heart in San Francisco?"

51:34.333 --> 51:35.458
Have you ever heard it?

51:36.833 --> 51:37.958
No?

51:37.958 --> 51:39.166
It's a great song.

51:40.583 --> 51:42.666
Hey, I've got an idea.

51:42.666 --> 51:44.041
I'm gonna call the radio station

51:44.041 --> 51:45.458
and have them play it.

51:45.458 --> 51:47.416
They'll even dedicate it to you,

51:47.416 --> 51:51.000
my new friend, who gave
his whole heart for love.

51:52.208 --> 51:53.041
- You crazy, man.

52:00.125 --> 52:01.208
- Get in there.

52:04.541 --> 52:05.833
Go on.

52:05.833 --> 52:06.666
That's it.

52:09.041 --> 52:10.791
Good thing you weren't much bigger.

52:12.708 --> 52:14.500
You got anything left to say?

52:14.500 --> 52:16.583
You know it's nothing personal, right?

52:16.583 --> 52:17.875
- You better not hurt her.

52:36.666 --> 52:39.166
- Good afternoon, you good people.

52:39.166 --> 52:42.708
We got something very
special for you today.

52:42.708 --> 52:44.708
This here is Brianna.

52:44.708 --> 52:47.708
She is a feisty young thing,

52:47.708 --> 52:49.958
but that's the fun part, am I right?

52:53.750 --> 52:57.916
I think we're gonna start
the bidding at 500,000 yuan.

53:05.041 --> 53:06.250
Do I hear 750?

53:08.916 --> 53:09.750
800?

53:12.750 --> 53:13.583
A million?

53:15.666 --> 53:16.791
Million five.

53:18.625 --> 53:19.916
Two million?

53:21.458 --> 53:22.625
Do I hear 220?

53:25.041 --> 53:25.958
225?

53:29.000 --> 53:32.875
Five million, sold,
that's it, auction's over.

53:34.416 --> 53:36.500
Babe, you just made me a millionaire.

53:40.625 --> 53:43.375
- Congratulations, Mr. J. Peterson.

53:44.958 --> 53:46.541
- Shut that thing off.

53:46.541 --> 53:48.291
You fucking bitch.

53:48.291 --> 53:49.416
Put her in the car.

53:51.833 --> 53:54.416
(arrow thwaps)

54:00.416 --> 54:01.250
- Home run.

54:01.250 --> 54:04.500
- Darius, why are you here?

54:04.500 --> 54:07.083
- I just couldn't let my friends get hurt.

54:07.083 --> 54:08.625
- You two both need to go home.

54:10.333 --> 54:12.375
- You're the one that needs to go home.

54:12.375 --> 54:14.541
- And if I don't, what are you gonna do,

54:14.541 --> 54:16.583
shoot me with your little arrows?

54:16.583 --> 54:17.833
Bullets travel faster.

54:17.833 --> 54:19.375
- Accuracy is the key.

54:19.375 --> 54:22.416
- Oh, I won't miss, trust me.

54:22.416 --> 54:24.833
- And neither will I, little lady.

54:24.833 --> 54:26.416
- Little lady?

54:26.416 --> 54:28.000
You think this is a western?

54:28.000 --> 54:29.541
You think you're in a western?

54:29.541 --> 54:31.458
- Seems that way, sometimes.

54:32.583 --> 54:33.750
- This is real life,

54:34.791 --> 54:37.791
but I'm a nice guy, and I
like to give people choices,

54:37.791 --> 54:40.833
so you can either walk
away and live another day,

54:40.833 --> 54:44.958
or die right here, right now, your choice.

54:44.958 --> 54:45.958
- Quite nice of you.

54:48.541 --> 54:50.875
(gun fires)

54:57.250 --> 54:58.208
- Don't move.

54:59.958 --> 55:00.791
Walk.

55:00.791 --> 55:02.583
- Even if you shoot me, it won't matter.

55:03.458 --> 55:04.291
- Go.

55:05.458 --> 55:07.250
- They want him, they're gonna get him.

55:07.250 --> 55:09.125
- Shut up, keep walking.

55:09.125 --> 55:10.083
- They'll send somebody.

55:10.083 --> 55:12.166
If not me, somebody else.

55:12.166 --> 55:13.083
- Go on.

55:13.083 --> 55:14.541
- With me or without me.

55:14.541 --> 55:15.541
- Stop talking.

55:15.541 --> 55:16.375
- Someone's gonna collect.

55:16.375 --> 55:17.166
- Shut up.

55:27.625 --> 55:28.791
You know what to do.

55:28.791 --> 55:30.083
Unlock the truck.

55:32.250 --> 55:34.250
Babe, you okay?

55:34.250 --> 55:36.416
- [Deon] Yeah, bae, I'm okay.

55:36.416 --> 55:37.250
- That's right.

55:41.208 --> 55:42.208
Be careful.

56:01.958 --> 56:05.291
(soft orchestral music)

56:15.333 --> 56:18.250
(car engine whirs)

57:48.333 --> 57:51.583
(truck engine rattles)

58:05.125 --> 58:07.500
I am so happy to see you.

58:07.500 --> 58:09.750
- [Truck Driver] Sorry,
it's been a crazy day.

58:09.750 --> 58:11.083
- Yeah, tell me about it, man.

58:11.083 --> 58:14.166
(truck engine whirs)

58:32.666 --> 58:33.958
- You can't run from us.

58:47.416 --> 58:48.500
- Assume the position.

58:54.083 --> 58:55.416
- You forced out our queen.

58:57.333 --> 58:58.166
- The queen?

59:16.458 --> 59:17.291
- Kneel.

59:22.208 --> 59:23.833
I said kneel.

59:27.250 --> 59:28.958
- [Deon] We don't kneel to no man.

59:30.208 --> 59:32.208
- And we're certainly not gonna do it

59:32.208 --> 59:33.708
for you two bitches.

59:35.250 --> 59:36.541
- Put it away.

59:36.541 --> 59:37.708
- Yes, your majesty.

59:38.666 --> 59:40.833
- I don't want you
damaging my merchandise.

59:45.041 --> 59:48.375
You two have been causing
me quite some trouble today.

59:48.375 --> 59:50.291
- [Bri] And you are?

59:51.291 --> 59:53.708
- Who I am is no concern of yours.

59:54.708 --> 59:55.916
Put them in the car.

59:59.041 --> 01:00:02.458
(eerie orchestral music)
