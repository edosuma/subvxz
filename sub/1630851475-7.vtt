WEBVTT

00:02.293 --> 00:04.421
Quickly. Quickly, or we'll lose it.

00:04.504 --> 00:07.674
Okay, okay. Almost there. Almost there.

00:10.593 --> 00:11.553
Okay.

00:12.137 --> 00:14.222
And... it's stable.

00:17.017 --> 00:19.519
-Our Vitamin C face serum is ready.

00:19.602 --> 00:22.647
It’s the same recipe
the girls in Blackpink use to make theirs.

00:22.731 --> 00:24.357
Can’t argue with K-pop.

00:57.974 --> 00:59.059
What?

01:18.620 --> 01:20.497
Well, let me know if that's okay.

01:20.580 --> 01:22.373
I'll definitely do that.

01:24.584 --> 01:27.629
Oh, great, I just friended
my high school girlfriend’s husband!

01:31.549 --> 01:34.385
Lahela, I think you should try
for Chief Resident.

01:34.469 --> 01:36.679
You're already such a leader
among your group,

01:36.763 --> 01:38.306
might as well make it official.

01:38.389 --> 01:39.682
That’s not till third year.

01:39.766 --> 01:41.476
Yeah, but it’ll be here
before you know it.

01:41.559 --> 01:44.687
Father Time is
the most toxic male of them all.

01:44.771 --> 01:48.858
You know, Chief Resident
was my first administrative position.

01:48.942 --> 01:52.153
Not to brag, but I had two pagers.

01:52.237 --> 01:53.404
Wow. Two pagers.

01:53.488 --> 01:56.324
-That's, like, one-third a cell phone.

01:56.407 --> 01:59.536
Chief Resident Kamealoha.
I like the sound of that.

01:59.619 --> 02:02.580
Besides, me as Chief Resident,
you as Chief of Staff...

02:03.665 --> 02:06.000
-could be pretty awesome.
-Yeah, it would.

02:07.043 --> 02:09.796
Oh, no, a cadaver
first thing in the morning?

02:09.879 --> 02:12.549
I hope our patients
get progressively more alive today.

02:12.632 --> 02:16.094
Actually, it's a gift for all of you.

02:17.720 --> 02:19.389
My favorite book.

02:19.472 --> 02:22.142
As part of my campaign for Chief of Staff,

02:22.225 --> 02:25.770
I'm sharing my all-encompassing
approach to medicine,

02:25.854 --> 02:30.608
where you take the patient's entire
physical condition into consideration,

02:30.692 --> 02:34.362
instead of just focusing on one symptom
or part of the body.

02:34.445 --> 02:38.158
And this book explains how we do the...

02:38.241 --> 02:41.077
<i>Code Gold. Code Gold.
Front entrance of the hospital.</i>

02:41.161 --> 02:42.745
What's a Code Gold?

02:48.877 --> 02:50.670
Code Gold is Dr. Lee's big surprise.

02:50.753 --> 02:52.547
He flew in Dr. Arthur Goldstein.

02:52.630 --> 02:55.300
The surgeon from Seattle
who 3D printed a heart valve?

02:55.383 --> 02:58.344
Yeah, he and Dr. Lee were
in the same fraternity back in the day.

02:58.428 --> 03:00.180
I can't wait to dig up all the dirt.

03:35.673 --> 03:37.550
Look who's bringing in the top doctors.

03:37.634 --> 03:40.511
Raising the hospital's profile
and keeping us on the cutting edge.

03:40.595 --> 03:42.263
This has to get me Chief of Staff.

03:42.347 --> 03:43.598
Calm down.

03:43.681 --> 03:46.142
You're bringing in one doctor. For a week.

03:46.226 --> 03:48.311
Uh, he's a cardiac savant.

03:48.394 --> 03:50.605
The guy does heart surgery with lasers.

03:50.688 --> 03:52.941
I don't know if it's safer,
but it's definitely cooler!

03:53.024 --> 03:55.860
Well, I think I'm the lock
for Chief of Staff

03:55.944 --> 04:00.615
because I mold our young doctors
into lifesaving machines.

04:00.698 --> 04:02.200
Like Terminators,

04:02.325 --> 04:03.952
but that keep people alive.

04:04.035 --> 04:05.954
Dr. Goldstein has that covered too, okay?

04:06.037 --> 04:08.915
He's at the forefront of peak performance
through biohacking.

04:08.998 --> 04:10.959
My boy's even got a podcast about it.

04:12.210 --> 04:14.003
You can hear yourself, right?

04:14.087 --> 04:15.880
Oh, that's all I hear.

04:16.881 --> 04:18.800
Hey, Dr. G! Thanks for coming.

04:18.883 --> 04:20.468
Uh, anything for a pledge brother.

04:22.136 --> 04:23.930
How could I turn you down?
You know all my secrets.

04:26.432 --> 04:27.892
-I'm Dr. Hannon.
-Hi!

04:27.976 --> 04:29.686
-I... Okay.
-Remember Havasu?

04:29.769 --> 04:31.980
Oh, man. That was insane!

04:32.063 --> 04:34.107
Uh, that's... Oh, please don't...

04:34.190 --> 04:36.276
Keep on doctoring.

04:36.359 --> 04:37.443
-Ooh.

04:37.527 --> 04:39.153
-There you go.
-Okay...

04:39.237 --> 04:40.196
DR.Nice wheels.

04:40.280 --> 04:42.156
Nice to kind of meet you.

04:42.282 --> 04:44.158
-Hey, Mom. They need you inside.
-Hm?

04:44.242 --> 04:46.035
Gail from accounting
tripped over the books.

04:46.119 --> 04:48.788
She said she'll forget the whole thing
if we give her cat hernia surgery.

04:48.871 --> 04:49.998
Okay.

05:24.282 --> 05:26.492
Hey, it's competition week.

05:26.576 --> 05:27.785
The Aloha Surf Cup!

05:28.411 --> 05:30.997
I get to live out my childhood
pro-surfer dreams.

05:31.080 --> 05:31.998
Jeez, Dad.

05:32.498 --> 05:34.125
I had a dream that I won the Super Bowl,

05:34.500 --> 05:36.919
but then I grew up
and I went on with life.

05:37.003 --> 05:38.504
It's not about winning.

05:38.588 --> 05:40.757
It's the brotherhood
with the other surfers.

05:41.382 --> 05:44.594
You know, in the ocean,
the competition just falls away.

05:45.261 --> 05:48.139
And when it comes back,
I'm usually in the top ten.

05:48.222 --> 05:49.766
The only thing
that does better than me is...

05:49.849 --> 05:50.933
Nine other surfers?

05:51.517 --> 05:52.643
The shave ice truck.

05:53.269 --> 05:55.980
And for the first time,
you boys will be running the truck...

05:56.064 --> 05:56.981
Solo.

05:57.065 --> 05:58.941
Yes! The majors!

05:59.025 --> 06:00.777
This is gonna be the best week ever!

06:00.860 --> 06:03.613
Maybe better than the first week
my truck made a profit

06:03.696 --> 06:05.823
when your mom
made me start charging people.

06:12.121 --> 06:13.289
DR.Now, we'll pause here.

06:14.791 --> 06:16.626
-This is the most delicate part...
-Wow.

06:16.709 --> 06:17.877
-...of the procedure.
-Packed house.

06:17.960 --> 06:20.338
Yeah. We're recording this
for his podcast.

06:20.421 --> 06:22.882
"The Goldstein Standard."

06:22.965 --> 06:25.218
-Okay... hi!

06:25.301 --> 06:28.179
Okay, so... now the valve is in.

06:28.262 --> 06:31.015
And this number in the corner
of the monitor is crucial.

06:31.099 --> 06:31.974
It's my heart rate.

06:32.058 --> 06:33.893
Never gets above 46 beats per minute.

06:33.976 --> 06:37.188
Thanks to meditation, supplements,
and Goldstein Coffee

06:37.271 --> 06:41.067
made with ghee, bee pollen,
and the green tea extract EGCG.

06:41.150 --> 06:44.987
All regular practices to keep me calm
and hyper-focused.

06:45.780 --> 06:47.865
You see, next to my bone saw,

06:47.949 --> 06:51.160
my lifestyle is my most
important surgical tool.

06:51.244 --> 06:52.662
Everybody, look under your chairs.

06:54.831 --> 06:58.209
The Goldstein Standard
starter kits for everyone!

06:59.502 --> 07:00.878
It's okay, you clap.

07:02.213 --> 07:04.048
Thank you. Thank you.

07:04.132 --> 07:05.383
This is great.

07:05.466 --> 07:07.468
Usually, we don't get free stuff
unless someone dies

07:07.552 --> 07:08.928
and no one comes to pick up their things.

07:09.011 --> 07:10.555
-That's how I got my favorite shawl.
-Mm.

07:10.638 --> 07:14.475
Okay, so, now let's see what it looks like
once the heart is stopped.

07:14.559 --> 07:16.185
I wonder how he fits the valve.

07:16.269 --> 07:19.230
If it's not perfect,
you could risk post-op ventricle tearing.

07:19.313 --> 07:21.983
Great question. Ask him on rounds.

07:22.066 --> 07:24.235
We have to ask him
about those black scrubs.

07:25.111 --> 07:27.155
This year, for the first time,

07:27.238 --> 07:30.283
I'll be offering a fellowship
to study with me in Seattle.

07:30.366 --> 07:33.453
Now, we will cover
all the cardiovascular procedures I do.

07:33.536 --> 07:35.037
And all my lifehacks as well.

07:35.121 --> 07:37.540
Might even let you
take the McLaren for a spin.

07:40.501 --> 07:41.711
Yeah, it's fast.

07:42.879 --> 07:45.423
Now, I can only handle one fellow.

07:45.506 --> 07:49.343
And, Dr. Lee, no, you cannot apply.

07:52.972 --> 07:54.807
I don't have a seat, so this is mine.

07:54.891 --> 07:56.267
Dr. Lee, put that back.

07:58.853 --> 08:00.062
Guess this is yours.

08:01.647 --> 08:03.357
ALOHA
SURF CUP

08:03.441 --> 08:05.443
<i>Welcome to the Aloha Surf Cup.</i>

08:05.526 --> 08:07.778
<i>The morning heats will start shortly.</i>

08:08.279 --> 08:11.741
<i>Surfers, stay close
and listen for your heat.</i>

08:11.824 --> 08:14.035
<i>The elimination rounds start soon.</i>

08:14.118 --> 08:14.994
Aloha.

08:15.077 --> 08:16.704
Benny Kamealoha, checking in.

08:16.787 --> 08:17.747
Great. Let me see.

08:17.830 --> 08:19.540
Benny Kamealoha...

08:20.124 --> 08:22.293
Benny Kamealoha...

08:22.376 --> 08:23.252
There you are.

08:23.878 --> 08:24.837
Good luck.

08:25.588 --> 08:26.964
Sunset Division?

08:27.048 --> 08:28.674
Does that mean I'm in the afternoon heats?

08:28.758 --> 08:30.384
No. It's just the name
we gave to the senior group.

08:30.468 --> 08:32.178
-Senior?
-Yeah, for the old guys.

08:32.261 --> 08:34.138
Oh, hang on, there must be some mistake.

08:34.222 --> 08:35.765
Look, I was top ten last year.

08:35.848 --> 08:37.016
Sorry. It's in the rules.

08:37.099 --> 08:40.478
Forty-five and up is the senior,
AKA, Sunset Division.

08:40.561 --> 08:42.396
Sunset? Dude, I'm nowhere near sunset.

08:42.480 --> 08:43.814
I'm like00 p.m., tops!

08:44.398 --> 08:45.566
See for yourself.

08:45.650 --> 08:46.984
Where does it say that?

08:51.322 --> 08:52.657
Why is the font so small?

08:53.866 --> 08:56.494
The Sunset Division's
just getting together over there.

08:57.286 --> 08:58.204
SUNSET
DIVISION

08:58.287 --> 08:59.705
Oh, my hip...

08:59.789 --> 09:01.249
Oh, you're okay, boss.

09:01.332 --> 09:02.416
Yeah...

09:04.252 --> 09:06.546
And they use the buddy system
for extra safety.

09:06.629 --> 09:08.881
Let me know if you want help carrying
your board over, Uncle.

09:08.965 --> 09:10.424
-What?
-Let me know

09:10.508 --> 09:12.426
if you want help carrying your board!

09:20.810 --> 09:22.186
Sunset Division.

09:23.563 --> 09:25.064
What about me is old?

09:25.147 --> 09:26.524
Really just your age.

09:28.150 --> 09:29.860
But it's not that bad, Dad.

09:29.944 --> 09:33.281
Yoda was 900 and still the best Jedi.

09:33.364 --> 09:34.490
Not funny.

09:34.574 --> 09:36.033
Regret saying that, you will!

09:37.076 --> 09:38.703
Hey.

09:38.786 --> 09:40.663
Found my old Chief Resident badge!

09:40.746 --> 09:42.498
When I had my Rachel haircut.

09:42.582 --> 09:44.166
Oh, look at her.

09:44.250 --> 09:46.085
No wonder Ross and Joey fought over you.

09:46.168 --> 09:47.587
Hm. Yeah.

09:47.670 --> 09:51.382
This morning, Lahela said
she was going to follow in my footsteps.

09:51.465 --> 09:52.717
So I dug that up.

09:52.800 --> 09:54.677
I thought she'd get
a kick out of seeing it.

09:54.760 --> 09:56.679
-Lahela would make a great Chief Resident.

09:56.762 --> 09:57.972
I know.

09:58.514 --> 10:02.852
When I suggested it,
I was so happy she liked the idea.

10:02.935 --> 10:05.605
We have been so in sync lately.

10:05.688 --> 10:07.273
I've got Mom-mentum.

10:07.356 --> 10:09.734
Which will immediately end
when she hears you call it that.

10:11.027 --> 10:12.028
-- Hey.
-- Hey.

10:12.111 --> 10:14.113
-Hi, Mom.
-Oh, there she is.

10:14.196 --> 10:16.115
I was just bragging about you.

10:16.198 --> 10:18.618
Well, I will really have
something to brag about

10:18.701 --> 10:20.661
when I get the Goldstein Fellowship!

10:21.954 --> 10:23.873
Really? That... You...

10:23.956 --> 10:25.416
You would be interested in that?

10:25.541 --> 10:29.170
I mean, his medical expertise.
The technology.

10:29.253 --> 10:30.755
I wanna learn all of it!

10:31.130 --> 10:32.882
So, I'm going for the fellowship.

10:34.675 --> 10:39.597
Yeah. He's doing
some interesting, innovative things.

10:39.680 --> 10:44.393
But he seems more focused
on the flash and self-promotion.

10:44.477 --> 10:45.478
Yeah, but, I mean,

10:45.561 --> 10:48.522
how cool would it be to be
on the cutting edge of medicine?

10:48.606 --> 10:53.569
Sure, but, Lahela,
your real strength as a doctor, is you.

10:53.653 --> 10:57.823
Your bedside manner, the way you listen,
and help patients.

10:57.907 --> 11:00.076
I just think you should be somewhere

11:00.159 --> 11:03.037
that you can share that
with the most people possible.

11:03.120 --> 11:06.499
That's just not
what Dr. Goldstein is about.

11:06.582 --> 11:08.918
Yeah, but he has his own podcast.

11:09.919 --> 11:12.254
And a line of mugs.

11:12.338 --> 11:14.507
And, I mean, come on.
You've seen the man's car.

11:14.590 --> 11:15.841
Sign me up!

11:16.759 --> 11:17.927
It was a rental!

11:21.555 --> 11:22.556
All right.

11:23.057 --> 11:24.558
You guys man the truck.

11:24.642 --> 11:26.310
I'm gonna go out there
and prove I still got it.

11:26.394 --> 11:28.688
First Sunset competitor to get top ten.

11:28.771 --> 11:30.189
Knock 'em dead, Dad!

11:30.272 --> 11:32.650
Uh, that wasn't a pun
because you're in the old group

11:32.733 --> 11:33.943
and someone might actually die.

11:34.026 --> 11:35.194
I just meant good luck.

11:35.277 --> 11:36.237
Uh-huh.

11:37.363 --> 11:39.448
All right, I'll set up out here.
You get the truck ready.

11:48.791 --> 11:50.876
I'm too young for all this power.

11:52.169 --> 11:54.171
Heavy is the syrup crown.

12:02.805 --> 12:03.848
-Morning, sir.
-Hey.

12:03.931 --> 12:04.890
Red Flag's up.

12:04.974 --> 12:07.101
Morning heats went out,
but we're calling it.

12:07.184 --> 12:08.644
Big storms rolling in.

12:08.728 --> 12:10.229
Sunset Division isn't going out today.

12:10.312 --> 12:11.355
Can't take chances.

12:11.439 --> 12:13.983
Old people are our greatest resource.

12:15.693 --> 12:17.945
-Hey.
-Hey. Mr. Kamealoha!

12:18.028 --> 12:19.071
You gotta get out there.

12:19.155 --> 12:20.865
Because of the big storm rolling in,

12:20.948 --> 12:23.033
they just red-flagged
the rest of the heats.

12:23.617 --> 12:24.535
Bummer.

12:24.618 --> 12:26.412
The waves are supposed to be
even bigger tomorrow.

12:26.495 --> 12:27.496
Twelve-foot swells.

12:28.080 --> 12:30.458
But even if they put up a red flag,
me and the guys are gonna surf.

12:30.541 --> 12:31.876
You should join if you're up for it.

12:31.959 --> 12:34.128
I'm up for it! For sure. Count me in.

12:37.214 --> 12:38.507
You hear that?

12:38.591 --> 12:41.302
You can't put a red flag... in here.

12:48.350 --> 12:52.313
And if your mind wanders... that's good.

12:53.230 --> 12:58.068
Bringing the mind back to the breath...
is the practice.

12:59.737 --> 13:03.783
Just shut the world out.
Shut... just, shut it out.

13:04.283 --> 13:05.659
Remember this feeling,

13:05.743 --> 13:07.787
'cause we're going to
bring it into the OR.

13:10.122 --> 13:11.499
DR.Extend your arms.

13:12.166 --> 13:13.542
Let go.

13:14.460 --> 13:15.586
And shake it out.

13:17.671 --> 13:20.841
Let it all rush through you
and out of your body.

13:20.925 --> 13:22.802
And now it's gone and we're clear.

13:22.885 --> 13:26.430
Hands to your heart,
right hand out, slap it away.

13:27.473 --> 13:29.266
Hand up, slap it away.

13:29.350 --> 13:30.601
Beautiful.

13:30.684 --> 13:32.478
You need some work. Beautiful though.

13:32.561 --> 13:34.814
You'll get there, it's okay. You're new...

13:37.733 --> 13:39.777
Let’s see this "Rock Star" surgeon.

13:40.611 --> 13:42.196
There he is, in the black scrubs.

13:43.656 --> 13:45.032
But don't look!

13:46.784 --> 13:48.536
Yeah, he’s in shape.

13:48.619 --> 13:50.037
Still a little nerdy though.

13:50.162 --> 13:53.290
Ugh. He can do
heart surgery laparoscopically.

13:54.208 --> 13:55.960
Without cracking open a patient's chest.

13:56.919 --> 14:00.256
When you say gross stuff like that,
I get super light...

14:02.258 --> 14:03.425
Whoa.

14:04.718 --> 14:05.678
You almost fainted.

14:05.761 --> 14:09.557
I recommend water, an orange,
and one Patrick Swayze lift.

14:16.564 --> 14:17.731
All right.

14:19.942 --> 14:20.985
Okay...

14:22.403 --> 14:23.612
That was cool.

14:23.696 --> 14:24.947
See?

14:33.080 --> 14:35.708
My Mom-mentum is totally gone.

14:35.791 --> 14:38.043
No, come on. You're overreacting.

14:38.544 --> 14:41.213
PS, how long would it take this face serum
to make me younger?

14:41.714 --> 14:45.634
Lahela has gone completely gaga
over Dr. Goldstein.

14:45.718 --> 14:49.179
We used to be the ones
that bonded over Dirty Dancing.

14:49.263 --> 14:51.557
@DR.KAMEALOHA

15:01.734 --> 15:06.614
We've both always been about whole health
and helping as many people as possible.

15:06.697 --> 15:09.450
But now she wants to go down
a different path.

15:09.533 --> 15:11.535
This is just a passing fad.

15:11.952 --> 15:13.913
Like how she used to be obsessed
with making slime.

15:13.996 --> 15:16.749
I worry I'm losing her to the dark side.

15:16.832 --> 15:17.875
Lahela?

15:17.958 --> 15:18.918
Never.

15:19.001 --> 15:20.044
Hey, guys!

15:20.127 --> 15:21.795
What do you think of my new black scrubs?

15:23.047 --> 15:26.091
I figure they will be perfect
for when I win the Goldstein Fellowship.

15:26.175 --> 15:28.928
I thought you wanted to be Chief Resident.

15:29.011 --> 15:31.472
Yeah, I did, but I don't know...

15:31.555 --> 15:33.933
I mean, this seems
a little more exciting, you know?

15:34.224 --> 15:37.102
-No offense.
-Yeah, no, of course...

15:38.395 --> 15:41.190
Oh, it's so hard to keep
my heart rate below 50!

15:41.273 --> 15:43.943
It just jumps up every time
I think about this fellowship.

15:46.570 --> 15:47.571
Okay.

16:06.924 --> 16:09.259
Dude, those are twelve-foot waves.

16:10.636 --> 16:13.472
Maybe one of us should go stop him.

16:13.555 --> 16:15.140
I'll go. You handle the truck.

16:21.271 --> 16:23.482
Alone at last.

16:27.111 --> 16:28.654
Awesome! You made it.

16:28.737 --> 16:31.198
Of course.
Can't miss out on the twelve-footers.

16:31.281 --> 16:33.200
Cool. I'll see you out there.

16:35.452 --> 16:36.704
Dad!

16:36.787 --> 16:38.622
Hey, what are you doing here?

16:38.706 --> 16:40.958
-You should be helping your brother.
-Oh, he's fine.

17:09.069 --> 17:11.572
Dad, don't do this.

17:11.655 --> 17:14.825
Even I can see that this is a bad idea,
and I never know stuff.

17:14.908 --> 17:16.994
I can handle it.
I've been surfing my whole life.

17:17.077 --> 17:18.162
It's in my bones.

17:18.245 --> 17:21.206
Yeah, but one bad fall
and all those bones might shatter.

17:21.290 --> 17:24.084
Walter shouldn't even be out there.
What are you trying to prove?

17:25.586 --> 17:27.379
That I'm Benny Kamealoha.

17:27.463 --> 17:28.964
I'm one with the water.

17:29.673 --> 17:31.675
Surfing is like breathing to me.

17:31.759 --> 17:33.427
I am not old and weak.

17:33.969 --> 17:35.304
I am peaking!

17:40.017 --> 17:41.268
Oh, good lord.

17:41.810 --> 17:42.811
My back went out.

17:43.687 --> 17:45.314
I'll get the heating pad.

17:45.939 --> 17:47.107
Hurry up.

17:56.116 --> 17:58.577
Dude. Dad is gonna be so mad at you.

17:58.660 --> 18:01.080
There's no punishment worse than this.

18:17.721 --> 18:18.972
Hey, Charles.

18:20.390 --> 18:22.351
Mind if I join you for your next patient?

18:22.434 --> 18:24.686
Not at all! I would love that!

18:25.604 --> 18:28.023
Painful abscess on the neck.

18:28.107 --> 18:30.901
We'll drain it,
get him on some oral antibiotics,

18:30.984 --> 18:33.028
and have him home soon.

18:34.363 --> 18:35.823
Dr. Hannon, can I have the...

18:36.657 --> 18:38.492
-Oh, my God, I'm so...

18:39.868 --> 18:40.828
Are you okay?

18:40.911 --> 18:42.871
Mm-hmm, I am.

18:44.039 --> 18:45.582
You know, you did this to me
once in a dream.

18:46.583 --> 18:48.293
It's not as bad as I thought it would be.

18:48.877 --> 18:51.797
You know what... I'm good.

18:54.049 --> 18:55.551
-Oh...

19:03.308 --> 19:06.311
<i>The Aloha Surf Cup final heat is underway.</i>

19:06.395 --> 19:08.021
Dad, it's the last day of the competition.

19:08.105 --> 19:09.273
Why don't you get out there?

19:09.356 --> 19:11.358
Nah. My time has passed.

19:11.441 --> 19:14.820
Now, I'm just a regular,
everyday shave ice and flower truck owner.

19:15.320 --> 19:19.158
Why do we ever go
into this dirty, dirty business?

19:19.241 --> 19:20.951
Learning an age-old lesson.

19:21.034 --> 19:22.744
Don't get high off your own supply.

19:24.163 --> 19:26.498
Dad, this is your favorite week.

19:27.082 --> 19:28.458
The camaraderie. The waves.

19:28.542 --> 19:29.918
And just 'cause
they moved you up a division,

19:30.002 --> 19:31.003
you're not gonna go out in the water?

19:32.087 --> 19:33.297
People have been dragging you
out of the ocean

19:33.797 --> 19:35.549
since you were old enough
to row yourself out there.

19:35.632 --> 19:38.385
I mean, Mom still complains
about how you surfed the day I was born.

19:38.468 --> 19:40.304
There was a storm
three miles off the island!

19:40.387 --> 19:41.722
The waves were coming in high!

19:41.805 --> 19:44.474
Your mom's water broke
but... not like those waves.

19:46.393 --> 19:47.686
And you were there for both.

19:48.687 --> 19:51.273
The two big loves of your life.
Your family and the ocean.

19:52.524 --> 19:57.613
Now, here I am, your family,
telling you to go in the ocean.

19:58.864 --> 20:00.324
Getting older is weird.

20:01.158 --> 20:03.744
You feel in your prime, 26, forever.

20:04.161 --> 20:05.078
But then one day,

20:05.162 --> 20:07.623
you hear Biggie
on the Old School Pandora channel,

20:07.706 --> 20:13.378
or your baby boy is giving you good advice
and six inches taller than you.

20:14.588 --> 20:15.923
It all gets real.

20:17.007 --> 20:19.676
And real... hurts.

20:23.597 --> 20:24.765
Well...

20:25.557 --> 20:28.310
take it from a junior
who can't wait to be a senior,

20:28.810 --> 20:30.604
there's an upside to getting older.

20:31.188 --> 20:36.526
Like, when I look at you,
I don't think "old," I think "vintage."

20:37.569 --> 20:39.029
'Cause age makes you cooler.

20:40.948 --> 20:42.074
Vintage.

20:43.116 --> 20:44.743
-Never thought of it like that.

20:45.619 --> 20:47.246
Plus, now that we're old enough,

20:47.329 --> 20:49.831
we can run the truck,
and you can go and surf.

20:51.708 --> 20:52.709
So...

20:56.463 --> 20:58.006
Go smoke those fools.

20:59.049 --> 21:00.217
Give me that.

21:01.677 --> 21:02.844
Thanks, Kai.

21:12.145 --> 21:13.438
That did not hurt.

21:14.564 --> 21:15.857
All right.

21:25.701 --> 21:28.120
Again, I'm so sorry.

21:28.203 --> 21:29.746
Although, I'm from Philly.

21:29.830 --> 21:32.416
-So, this wasn't my first stabbing.

21:32.499 --> 21:33.750
It's okay.

21:34.126 --> 21:36.169
Hm. I know you've been a little distracted

21:36.253 --> 21:39.423
since Lahela's gotten
all chummy-chummy with Dr. Goldstein.

21:39.506 --> 21:43.343
-Oh, that? I don't even...
-You're pressing really hard on my arm.

21:43.427 --> 21:46.305
Sorry. I... it's just...

21:47.264 --> 21:49.641
You think once you're a parent,

21:49.725 --> 21:54.021
you'll have everything figured out,
but you don't.

21:56.440 --> 22:00.360
If I'm being honest,
besides from just missing her...

22:02.362 --> 22:05.574
I liked when she looked up
to me professionally.

22:06.033 --> 22:10.537
You know, parents want their kids
to be proud of them too.

22:10.620 --> 22:11.913
At least, I do.

22:13.415 --> 22:15.334
That's what makes you a good mom.

22:18.086 --> 22:20.756
I just worry she's making a mistake.

22:22.090 --> 22:27.179
I had a "let them touch the stove
to learn it's hot" type of mom.

22:27.262 --> 22:29.681
My older brother doesn't
even have fingerprints because of it.

22:29.765 --> 22:30.891
-But...

22:31.475 --> 22:33.477
...we were better off in the long run.

22:33.560 --> 22:36.104
Well, I, I wanna be that mom.

22:36.855 --> 22:40.442
But I fear Lahela
is losing her north star.

22:41.026 --> 22:45.072
She's forgetting why
she got into medicine in the first place.

22:45.155 --> 22:47.032
To help the most people.

22:47.115 --> 22:48.909
I mean, she was nine,

22:48.992 --> 22:51.328
but she had a very clear vision.

22:52.079 --> 22:57.209
Well, if you really think she's headed
toward a fire and not just a hot stove...

22:57.918 --> 23:00.087
Sometimes Mama Bears have to roar.

23:03.590 --> 23:04.633
You're right.

23:04.966 --> 23:06.927
I'm gonna tell her she can't do it.

23:10.389 --> 23:11.723
Thank you, Charles.

23:13.558 --> 23:14.810
-Ow.
-Sorry.

23:25.779 --> 23:27.072
What's wrong, sweetie?

23:27.572 --> 23:30.325
Dr. Goldstein said
he wouldn't even consider me

23:30.409 --> 23:32.702
for the fellowship because of my age.

23:32.786 --> 23:33.870
What?

23:34.621 --> 23:36.415
That is not okay.

23:36.498 --> 23:38.166
I know you didn't want me
to do it, but I...

23:38.250 --> 23:39.418
Doesn't matter.

23:39.584 --> 23:43.088
If you're the best person for the job,
it should be yours.

23:43.171 --> 23:44.297
Mom, it's fine.

23:44.381 --> 23:46.258
No, it's not.

23:47.050 --> 23:48.468
Mom, what are you doing?

23:49.553 --> 23:50.846
Look, I...

23:51.304 --> 23:52.139
...I was only ten,

23:52.222 --> 23:54.516
but the second the man
in the gorgeous Porsche

23:54.599 --> 23:56.017
said I'm a heart surgeon,

23:56.101 --> 23:58.687
I saw my whole future
just right in front of me.

23:58.770 --> 24:00.230
-DR.Yeah.
-We need to talk.

24:00.313 --> 24:03.275
Doctor, we're recording a podcast here.

24:03.358 --> 24:05.819
You disqualified her because of her age?

24:06.445 --> 24:07.446
Let me tell you something.

24:07.946 --> 24:10.615
Dr. Kamealoha is the best doctor here.

24:10.699 --> 24:12.284
Most potential by far.

24:12.367 --> 24:16.079
You don't get to put limitations
on my daughter.

24:16.163 --> 24:17.664
She's a talented doctor,

24:17.747 --> 24:22.085
but my practice requires an almost
a monk-like control of your emotions.

24:22.669 --> 24:24.588
A teenager can't handle
that kind of pressure

24:24.671 --> 24:26.590
or maintain that type of focus.

24:27.090 --> 24:31.136
<i>Code Blue. Code Blue.
All available personnel, report to the ER.</i>

24:31.219 --> 24:32.929
<i>Code Blue.</i>

24:35.182 --> 24:37.642
Okay. There's been a tour bus accident.

24:37.726 --> 24:40.270
Dispatch said
the first ambulances are inbound.

24:40.353 --> 24:41.438
Head wounds, fractures,

24:41.521 --> 24:43.732
and a couple
of possible level-three traumas.

24:43.815 --> 24:45.358
I'm here too. Let me know how I can help.

24:45.442 --> 24:47.694
Great. First one up looks like
a compound fracture.

24:47.777 --> 24:49.779
-Would you mind handling?
-Uh, got it. You two nurses, come with me.

24:49.863 --> 24:51.656
No, no, no. You can't take two nurses.

24:51.740 --> 24:54.409
Okay, uh, you, prepare an exam room
and call the attending anesthesiologist.

24:54.493 --> 24:57.120
No time for that either.
This ER is about to be swamped.

24:57.204 --> 24:59.372
-Doctor, I've been in this situation...
-Dr. G, stand down.

24:59.456 --> 25:01.750
Lahela, you're up. Excuse me.

25:01.833 --> 25:03.335
Hi. I'm Dr. Kamealoha.

25:03.418 --> 25:05.962
I know it looks bad,
but everything's gonna be okay. Okay?

25:06.046 --> 25:08.715
I need a fiberglass splint
and five milligrams of Diazepam to sedate.

25:08.798 --> 25:10.091
Stat.

25:10.175 --> 25:12.093
Oh, probable concussion here.

25:12.177 --> 25:14.429
The EMTs immobilized the level-threes.

25:15.889 --> 25:17.724
Hi, how are you feeling?

25:17.807 --> 25:19.059
I know it hurts.

25:19.142 --> 25:20.185
But it's actually good.

25:20.268 --> 25:22.896
It means you're feeling something, okay?

25:22.979 --> 25:24.856
Squeeze my hand. Good.

25:24.940 --> 25:26.733
Squeeze my hand. Nice.

25:34.574 --> 25:35.742
Clear.

25:40.664 --> 25:41.957
Welcome back.

25:43.291 --> 25:46.836
Dr. Lee, we have a rapid erratic heartbeat
over here that we can't bring down.

25:46.920 --> 25:48.004
Have you tried Adenosine?

25:48.088 --> 25:50.340
Yeah, but he's not responding.
He's still in SVT.

25:50.423 --> 25:52.926
We might have to do something,
maybe put in a pacemaker.

25:53.009 --> 25:54.386
-Prep the OR.
-Yes.

25:54.469 --> 25:56.012
Looks like I'm playing
a doubleheader today.

25:56.096 --> 25:58.640
I need a brain MRI
for possible concussion for her.

25:58.723 --> 26:00.642
Is the pain shooting down your arm
or is it just in your neck?

26:01.142 --> 26:02.852
And a C-spine X-ray
to rule out spinal cord damage.

26:05.146 --> 26:07.399
Can I get a Kelly clamp
and mosquito forceps?

26:07.482 --> 26:08.984
There's debris in this laceration.

26:09.067 --> 26:10.485
-Here you go, Doctor.
-Thank you.

26:10.569 --> 26:11.820
Thank you.

26:14.739 --> 26:16.575
Start flushing while I go for this glass.

26:21.329 --> 26:22.747
Hey, how's it going?

26:22.831 --> 26:23.873
Hold on.

26:24.291 --> 26:26.209
Is he in the Sunset Division?

26:26.585 --> 26:28.086
Who let this kid in our heat?

26:28.169 --> 26:30.213
Kid? You're calling me "kid"?

26:30.297 --> 26:31.464
When were you born?

26:31.548 --> 26:33.258
Too long ago to be in the main group.

26:35.093 --> 26:36.595
The kid's funny too.

26:36.678 --> 26:39.598
Well, come on. What are we waiting for?
Let's get in there.

26:39.681 --> 26:40.932
Let's go!

26:41.516 --> 26:44.644
Oh. Look at the whippersnapper
showing off his good knees.

26:44.728 --> 26:47.522
Last time I ran like that,
this wasn't even a state!

26:58.617 --> 27:00.535
Hey, check it out. Dad's happy again.

27:01.119 --> 27:03.830
You should've seen last year,
I'm so small.

27:03.913 --> 27:04.914
Oh, great.

27:04.998 --> 27:07.083
Nope. I can't look up yet.

27:07.167 --> 27:10.128
Yeah. You'll only do this three more times
before you learn your lesson.

27:32.609 --> 27:34.110
That was amazing.

27:35.236 --> 27:37.572
You were poised, you were in control.

27:38.907 --> 27:41.451
I never should've dismissed you
because of your age.

27:44.079 --> 27:46.122
You're a phenomenal doctor.

27:46.956 --> 27:48.083
Thank you.

28:12.524 --> 28:13.942
He offered you the fellowship?

28:14.025 --> 28:15.318
He did.

28:17.445 --> 28:18.863
But I turned it down.

28:25.870 --> 28:26.913
Why?

28:28.665 --> 28:30.834
Working that Code Blue with you...

28:31.459 --> 28:35.380
reminded me of why I wanted
to be a doctor in the first place.

28:37.048 --> 28:39.342
To help as many people as possible.

28:41.052 --> 28:44.639
And watching how you lead us
through it all,

28:45.223 --> 28:46.975
that's what I wanna do.

28:48.518 --> 28:50.812
Look, I wanna be a baller and all, but...

28:52.522 --> 28:55.024
what I really want is to be a leader...

28:56.359 --> 28:57.360
like you.

29:02.907 --> 29:05.201
-I'm gonna go for Chief Resident.
-Really?

29:05.285 --> 29:06.202
Oh.

29:06.745 --> 29:08.496
-You would be so good at it.

29:08.580 --> 29:09.873
-Thank you, Mom.

29:11.291 --> 29:12.876
You wanna make more face serum tonight?

29:12.959 --> 29:16.629
I do. Your dad used up
our whole first batch.

29:16.713 --> 29:17.881
Did he really?

29:17.964 --> 29:19.674
-Yeah.

29:24.095 --> 29:25.930
I love you so much.

29:30.769 --> 29:33.354
My Mom-mentum is back.

29:34.063 --> 29:35.398
-Your what?
-Huh?

29:36.274 --> 29:37.650
-What'd you say?
-What'd you say?

29:37.734 --> 29:38.735
No, you said something.

29:38.818 --> 29:40.278
-You said something.
-I didn't say anything.

29:40.361 --> 29:41.613
You said "Mom-mentum."

29:41.696 --> 29:43.281
-What's that?
-I don't know.

29:43.364 --> 29:44.282
That's not a thing.

30:01.508 --> 30:04.427
Sometimes, stepping off the path

30:04.511 --> 30:08.056
makes you realize
you were on the right one all along.

30:08.139 --> 30:11.726
Another way to think of it is,
two paths diverged in the woods.

30:12.727 --> 30:15.355
And I'm taking the one trail-blazed
by my mom.
