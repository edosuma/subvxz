00:10.111 --> 00:12.111
     (sniffs)

00:12.113 --> 00:13.879
       WHAT'S THAT SMELL?
       IS IT GARBAGE DAY?

00:15.282 --> 00:17.649
           NO, I MADE BREAKFAST.

00:19.153 --> 00:21.754
      OH! DID YOU MAKE IT
      WITH GARBAGE?

00:23.090 --> 00:27.793
   SINCE YOUR MOM PASSED AWAY,
   I KNOW HOW HARD IT IS FOR YOU
   ON HER BIRTHDAY,

00:27.795 --> 00:31.397
        SO I MADE YOU
        A FEAST OF EGGS, BACON
        AND BUTTERMILK PANCAKES!

00:31.399 --> 00:34.066
       THAT IS SO SWEET.

00:34.068 --> 00:35.834
    WHERE ARE THOSE THINGS?

00:37.405 --> 00:39.938
           ALSO, I PUT $20

00:39.940 --> 00:41.974
      IN THE JULIA CHILD
      SMITHSONIAN TRIP JAR

00:41.976 --> 00:44.810
-(gasps)
-AND IF SOMEONE WOULD STOP
TAKING QUARTERS OUT OF THE JAR,

00:44.812 --> 00:46.145
   WOULD FINALLY
   BE ABLE TO TAKE THAT TRIP

00:46.147 --> 00:47.780
     YOU AND YOUR MOM
     ALWAYS DREAMED ABOUT.

00:47.782 --> 00:49.982
    AWW. OH! YOU HEAR THAT?

00:49.984 --> 00:52.084
MOM JUST SAID
YOU'RE THE BEST FRIEND EVER.

00:52.086 --> 00:54.853
                 AWW. THANK YOU,
                 MRS. DIAMOND.

00:54.855 --> 00:56.722
OH! WHAT WAS THAT NOW?

00:56.724 --> 01:00.359
(gasps)
BREAKFAST SHOULD BE YOUR
MOST IMPORTANT MEAL OF THE DAY,

01:00.361 --> 01:02.261
NOT YOUR LAST.

01:03.898 --> 01:05.697
  I THINK SHE'S A SMART LADY.

01:06.867 --> 01:09.968
     -WHY DON'T
     I MAKE YOU BREAKFAST?
     -OH, GOOD IDEA.

01:09.970 --> 01:12.071
      TWO ORGANIC EGGS,
      TOAST, BACON EXTRA CRISPY,

01:12.073 --> 01:13.739
     AND TICK-TOCK,
     'CAUSE I GOTTA GET TO WORK.

01:13.741 --> 01:14.807
            (laughs)

01:14.809 --> 01:16.708

01:21.816 --> 01:23.949
   <i> ¶ SHE'S IN THE SPOTLIGHT ¶ </i>

01:23.951 --> 01:25.951
   <i> ¶ AND SHE TURNED MY HEAD ¶ </i>

01:25.953 --> 01:27.753
   <i> ¶ SHE'D RUN A RED LIGHT ¶ </i>

01:27.755 --> 01:29.488
 <i> ¶ COS SHE'S BAD LIKE THAT ¶ </i>

01:29.490 --> 01:32.491
     <i> ¶ I LIKE THAT </i>

01:32.493 --> 01:34.226

      <i> ¶ I LIKE THAT OOH, BABY </i>
      <i> OOH, BABY ¶ </i>

01:36.964 --> 01:39.364
              GABI! MORE COFFEE!

01:39.366 --> 01:43.168
 -I HAVEN'T SLEPT IN TWO DAYS.
 -WOW. SOUNDS LIKE SOMEBODY'S
 GETTING LUCKY.

01:43.170 --> 01:45.437
THAT PUTS THE "NASTY"
IN "DOING THE NASTY."

01:48.175 --> 01:50.776
     SEX WITH ALAN IS WILD.

01:50.778 --> 01:52.411
      I FEEL LIKE ELLIOT,

01:52.413 --> 01:54.246
      QUEEN OF THE JUNGLE.

01:55.382 --> 01:57.316
      LAS NIGHT WE DID IT

01:57.318 --> 01:59.485
    IN THE CRAZIEST PLACE...

02:00.955 --> 02:02.855
 (whispers) THE BEDROOM FLOOR.

02:03.958 --> 02:05.991
OH PLEASE, I'VE DONE IT
ON THE FLOOR

02:05.993 --> 02:07.759
OF BED, BATH & BEYOND.

02:08.929 --> 02:11.196
I WENT IN WITH A 20% OFF COUPON,

02:11.198 --> 02:13.499
AND GOT 100% OFF.

02:15.936 --> 02:17.402
           HEY! SO...

02:17.404 --> 02:20.205
BEFORE MY AMAZING GIRLFRIEND
COMES DOWN, I NEED YOUR HELP.

02:20.207 --> 02:21.690
SHAUNA IS BEING HONORED

02:21.691 --> 02:23.174
BY THE SAN FRANCISCO
JOURNALISTS ASSOCIATION,

02:23.177 --> 02:24.843
AND I NEED TO THINK
OF AN AWESOME GIFT.

02:24.845 --> 02:26.478
           OH, AND...

02:26.480 --> 02:27.779
         FERRIS WHEEL.

02:27.781 --> 02:29.114
(mockingly)
OH, LOOK AT ME.

02:29.116 --> 02:30.849
I'M RICH. I CAN BUY
A FERRIS WHEEL.

02:32.353 --> 02:33.619
      I WAS TALKING ABOUT

02:33.620 --> 02:34.886
   THE CRAZIEST PLACE I EVER
   HAD SEX.

02:35.990 --> 02:37.322
       IN A FERRIS WHEEL

02:37.324 --> 02:39.825
AT A WEDDING WITH A CARNIVAL
THEME.

02:39.827 --> 02:40.859
           BEAT THAT.

02:40.861 --> 02:42.261
                I CAN.

02:42.263 --> 02:44.229
 MY DAUGHTER'S SEVENTH BIRTHDAY

02:44.231 --> 02:45.364
      IN THE BOUNCY CASTLE

02:45.366 --> 02:46.865
        WITH THE CLOWN.

02:46.867 --> 02:48.267
   IT TURNS OUT NOSES AREN'T

02:48.269 --> 02:50.302
   THE ONLY THING CLOWNS LIKE
   TO HONK.

02:51.505 --> 02:53.906
UGH! KIDS, CLOWNS, HETERO SEX--

02:53.908 --> 02:55.340
  THERE'S NOTHING FOR ME HERE.

02:57.344 --> 02:59.044
             UMM...

02:59.046 --> 03:01.013
    YOU HAVE ANOTHER KID...

03:01.015 --> 03:01.914
         BESIDES BRETT?

03:01.916 --> 03:04.082
       YEAH, DANIELLE, SHE'S 25.

03:04.084 --> 03:06.051
WOW.
(chuckles) TWO KIDS.

03:06.053 --> 03:07.853
(stammers)
IS THAT IT?

03:07.855 --> 03:10.856
      I DON'T TALK
      ABOUT DANIELLE THAT OFTEN.

03:10.858 --> 03:13.225
     UNFORTUNATELY,
     WE HAVEN'T SPOKEN IN YEARS.

03:13.227 --> 03:15.360
WHAT? A MOTHER-DAUGHTER
NOT CLOSE? WHAT HAPPENED?

03:15.362 --> 03:17.462
     GABI, SOUNDS LIKE IT'S KIND
     OF A PRIVATE THING.

03:17.464 --> 03:18.997
(whispers) YEAH, YEAH,
THAT'S WHY I'M ASKING.

03:20.100 --> 03:21.433
        IT'S OKAY, JOSH.

03:21.435 --> 03:23.368
            I WAS A CHILD MYSELF
            WHEN I HAD HER.

03:23.370 --> 03:26.004
      AND IF I'M TRUTHFUL,
      I THINK WE'RE JUST
      TOO MUCH ALIKE.

03:27.274 --> 03:30.175
   -NOW CAN
   WE TALK ABOUT BREAKFAST?
   -YES. WOULD YOU LIKE EGGS?

03:30.177 --> 03:32.010
AND DO YOU AT LEAST SEND
EACH OTHER CHRISTMAS CARDS?

03:32.947 --> 03:35.414
     WELL, I DO. I JUST--
     I NEVER GET ONE BACK.

03:35.416 --> 03:37.282
NOT EVEN AN E-CARD?

03:38.219 --> 03:39.384
BUT THEY'RE FREE.

03:39.386 --> 03:43.989
    LAST I HEARD,
    SHE WAS MAKING ARTISANAL
    MAPLE SYRUP IN VERMONT.

03:43.991 --> 03:46.892
    NOW IF YOU'LL EXCUSE ME,
    I'M OFF TO GO CRY IN MY CAR.

03:46.894 --> 03:49.294
   -SHAUNA!
   -I'M JUST KIDDING.
   A DRIVER'S PICKING ME UP.

03:49.296 --> 03:50.996
       I'M GONNA CRY IN HIS CAR.

03:52.399 --> 03:55.901
-(door opens, closes)
-HEY, YOU KNOW WHAT A GREAT GIFT
FOR SHAUNA WOULD BE?

03:55.903 --> 03:57.936
             A THERAPIST...
             THANKS TO YOU.

03:57.938 --> 04:00.505
NO. GET HER
AND HER DAUGHTER BACK TOGETHER.

04:00.507 --> 04:02.441
             NO, THAT'S SHAUNA'S
             PERSONAL BUSINESS.

04:02.443 --> 04:04.176
       -IT'S NOT MY PLACE
       TO GET INVOLVED.
       -YEAH, THAT'S WHY

04:04.178 --> 04:06.211
IT WOULD BE
SUCH A GREAT SURPRISE--
SHE'D NEVER SEE IT COMING.

04:06.213 --> 04:08.647
EVERY MOTHER
AND DAUGHTER WANT TO BE CLOSE.
COME ON, JOSH, TRUST ME.

04:08.649 --> 04:11.283
                (laughs)
                TRUST YOU? NO.

04:11.285 --> 04:12.317
             -BUT--
             -NO!

04:12.319 --> 04:13.352
       -IS THAT A FIRM--
       -YES!

04:13.354 --> 04:14.653
       -SO THAT'S A YES!
       -NO!

04:14.655 --> 04:15.988
                 NO!

04:15.990 --> 04:17.022
                  NO.

04:17.024 --> 04:18.055
            -JUST--
            -NO.

04:18.058 --> 04:19.124
OKAY.

04:24.064 --> 04:26.164
          (yelps)
          OH MY DAMN.

04:26.166 --> 04:27.566
             A PIG IN A BLANKET.

04:28.936 --> 04:30.235
I DON'T KNOW WHAT HAPPENED.

04:30.237 --> 04:32.437
I CAME TO GET JOSH'S TUX
FOR THE CLEANER'S,

04:32.439 --> 04:35.941
I SMELLED HIS PILLOW,
AND THE NEXT THING I KNOW--

04:35.943 --> 04:38.277
       -OKAY, NIGHT-NIGHT.
       -NUH-UH.

04:39.446 --> 04:42.514
         OKAY, BABY, SOMETHING
         DEFINITELY ISN'T RIGHT.

04:42.516 --> 04:45.517
       COME ON. I DON'T USUALLY
       PUT YOU DOWN FOR YOUR NAP
       UNTIL 4:00.

04:47.388 --> 04:51.123
    I SPENT MY FIRST
    WEEKEND AT ALAN'S PLACE
    AND COULDN'T SLEEP,

04:51.125 --> 04:53.592
'CAUSE I WAS AFRAID I MIGHT
DO SOMETHING EMBARRASSING.

04:53.594 --> 04:56.094
   IT CAN'T BE MORE EMBARRASSING
   THAN WHAT YOU DO
   WHEN YOU'RE AWAKE.

04:57.598 --> 04:59.164
    HEY, I JUST GOT AN IDEA.

04:59.166 --> 05:01.566
CAN YOU COME OVER TO MY HOUSE
AND WATCH ME SLEEP?

05:01.568 --> 05:03.568
       I WOULD,
       BUT <i> THE EXORCIST </i> IS ON,

05:03.570 --> 05:06.138
        AND WATCHING THAT SOUNDS
        A LITTLE LESS SCARY.

05:08.008 --> 05:09.641
        I CAN GET YOU
        FRONT-ROW SEATS
        TO SEE USHER!

05:10.711 --> 05:13.011
    I'M GONNA NEED YOUR ADDRESS,
    A KEY, AND SOME HOLY WATER.

05:20.354 --> 05:22.554
HEY, JOSH,
I MADE YOU A LITTLE SNACK--

05:22.556 --> 05:24.089
CHICKEN AND WAFFLES.

05:24.091 --> 05:26.058
                 NO THANK YOU.
                 I'M NOT HUNGRY.

05:26.060 --> 05:28.493
"WHERE'S THE MAPLE SYRUP,"
YOU SAY?

05:29.430 --> 05:31.063
                   I DIDN'T SAY.

05:33.634 --> 05:34.733
      WHAT ARE YOU SAYING?

05:36.136 --> 05:38.970
I'M JUST SAYING THE SYRUP'S
ON THE WAY OVER...

05:38.972 --> 05:40.172
         FROM VERMONT.

05:41.241 --> 05:42.974
          -YOU DIDN'T.
          -I DID.

05:42.976 --> 05:45.010
      I CALLED DANIELLE,
      AND SHE REALLY WANTS
      TO SEE HER MOM.

05:45.012 --> 05:46.978
     I KNOW YOU TOLD ME
     NOT TO, BUT IT WAS
     THE RIGHT THING TO DO.

05:46.980 --> 05:48.714
      -I HAD TO!
      -GABI, CALL IT OFF.

05:48.716 --> 05:50.649
       -(doorbell rings)
       -TOO LATE.

05:52.019 --> 05:54.252
    SHAUNA, WOULD YOU
    COME DOWN HERE, PLEASE?

05:54.254 --> 05:56.355
       HOW DARE YOU!
       I CLEARLY SAID NO.

05:56.357 --> 05:58.290
THERE WERE NO OTHER WORDS
SURROUNDING IT. ONE WORD. "NO."

05:58.292 --> 06:00.125
   WHAT'S ALL THE COMMOTION?

06:00.127 --> 06:01.460
   SHAUNA, I WANT YOU TO KNOW

06:01.462 --> 06:03.795
        -I HAD NOTHING
        TO DO WITH THIS.
        -TA-DA!

06:05.466 --> 06:07.165
                   HI, MOM.

06:07.167 --> 06:09.668
        (gasps)
        OH MY GOD! DANI!

06:09.670 --> 06:13.004
  -WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?
  -WELL, SHE FLEW ALL THE WAY
  ACROSS THE COUNTRY

06:13.006 --> 06:15.040
 BECAUSE SHE WANTED TO SEE YOU.
 ISN'T THAT RIGHT, DANIELLE?

06:15.042 --> 06:17.509
         WHEN GABI CALLED ME,
         I JUMPED AT THE CHANCE.

06:17.511 --> 06:20.245
AND YOU WANNA KNOW WHY
SHE NEVER SENT YOU ANY CARDS?
WELL, YOU TELL HER.

06:20.247 --> 06:23.181
       -IT'S-- IT'S--
       -SHE REALLY NEEDED
       HER INDEPENDENCE,

06:23.183 --> 06:26.752
BUT NOW SHE REALIZES THAT--
YOU TELL HER.

06:28.355 --> 06:32.057
      MY LIFE IS
      NOWHERE NEAR AS GOOD
      WITHOUT YOU IN IT.

06:32.059 --> 06:34.192
        CAN YOU EVER FORGIVE ME?

06:34.194 --> 06:35.327
             CAN I?

06:36.663 --> 06:39.264
       (gasps)
       SHE CAN. SHE CAN.

06:42.035 --> 06:44.770
     SEE, JOSH?
     I TOLD YOU THIS WOULD
     ALL WORK OUT.

06:44.772 --> 06:46.638
   NOW, IF YOU WANNA PAY ME BACK
   FOR HER PLANE TICKET,

06:46.640 --> 06:49.441
  -THAT WOULD BE REALLY GREAT.
  -NOT COOL.

06:49.443 --> 06:51.810
THIS IS TOTALLY NOT COOL.
THIS IS A DISASTER.

06:51.812 --> 06:53.812
                SERIOUSLY?
                ARE YOU SEEING
                WHAT I'M SEEING?

06:53.814 --> 06:56.481
       BECAUSE WHAT
       I'M SEEING IS A BEAUTIFUL
       MOTHER-DAUGHTER REUNION

06:56.483 --> 06:57.783
                HAPPENING RIGHT
                IN FRONT OF US.

06:57.785 --> 07:00.051
    WHAT COULD POSSIBLY BE WRONG
    WITH THIS PICTURE?

07:00.053 --> 07:01.853
   -THAT'S FERRIS-WHEEL GIRL!
   -(gasps)

07:07.394 --> 07:09.094
       ARE YOU SURE
       THAT'S FERRIS-WHEEL GIRL?

07:09.096 --> 07:10.695
          I MEAN, IT WAS
          YEARS AGO IN THE DARK.

07:10.697 --> 07:12.664
DARK?
SHE WAS ALL LIT UP.

07:12.666 --> 07:14.266
HER BODY WAS RED,
THEN BLUE,

07:14.268 --> 07:16.768
THEN YELLOW...
THEN RED AGAIN.

07:18.138 --> 07:21.740
    -WELL, MAYBE
    SHE WON'T REMEMBER YOU.
    -COME ON, GABI. IT'S ME!

07:23.110 --> 07:26.111
      JOSH, I'M SO EXCITED
      TO SAY THIS,

07:26.113 --> 07:28.079
   MEET MY DAUGHTER DANIELLE.

07:28.081 --> 07:30.282
(haltingly)
HI, I'M JOSH.

07:31.218 --> 07:32.784
          HEY, NICE TO MEET YOU.

07:34.521 --> 07:36.755
(haltingly)
NICE TO MEET YOU, TOO.

07:38.325 --> 07:42.127
       -WELL, THIS CALLS
       FOR CHAMPAGNE.
       -GREAT IDEA!

07:42.129 --> 07:45.764
     -(cellphone rings)
     -OH! I'M SORRY, DANI.
     IT'S ANDERSON COOPER.

07:45.766 --> 07:48.333
     HE GETS REAL WHINY
     IF YOU DON'T PICK UP.
     I'LL BE RIGHT BACK.

07:50.838 --> 07:53.672
SO... MAPLE SYRUP, HUH?

07:53.674 --> 07:56.208
        YEAH, IT'S KINDA RANDOM,
        BUT IT SUITS ME.

07:56.210 --> 07:59.110
(chuckling) VERMONT!

08:00.414 --> 08:03.482
PRETTY COLD THERE.
GETS KIND OF COLD THERE
IN THE WINTER.

08:03.484 --> 08:07.352
  YEAH. WAY TO COLD
  TO HAVE SEX ON A FERRIS WHEEL.

08:07.354 --> 08:09.688
   I KNEW IT!
   I KNEW YOU REMEMBERED ME!

08:09.690 --> 08:11.756
         YEAH, WHO COULD FORGET?
         YOU WERE RED,

08:11.758 --> 08:14.526
          HEN BLUE, THEN YELLOW,
          AND THEN RED AGAIN.

08:15.562 --> 08:18.497
     -CHAMPAGNE IS SERVED.
     -IT'S HER. I TOLD YOU.

08:18.499 --> 08:21.233
YOU'RE FERRIS-WHEEL GIRL?

08:21.235 --> 08:22.501
            DAMN IT!

08:22.503 --> 08:24.403
DO YOU SEE WHAT YOU DID?

08:24.404 --> 08:26.304
DO YOU SEE WHAT YOU DID
WHEN YOU DID THE THING
I TOLD YOU NOT TO DO?

08:26.306 --> 08:28.173
WELL, IF YOU DIDN'T DO THE THING
THAT YOU SHOULDN'T HAVE DONE,

08:28.175 --> 08:30.408
    THEN THE THING I DID
    WOULD'VE BEEN THE THING
    THAT I SHOULD'VE DONE!

08:31.578 --> 08:35.246
 -SO WHAT ARE WE GONNA DO?
 -OKAY, EVERYBODY JUST SHUT UP,
 ALL RIGHT?

08:35.249 --> 08:36.881
  THIS IS A VERY PRECIOUS DAY.

08:38.751 --> 08:40.284
        YOU KNOW WHAT
        YOU DID TO HIM.

08:40.287 --> 08:42.787
  HE KNOWS WHAT HE DID TO YOU.
  THE IMPORTANT THING IS

08:42.789 --> 08:45.690
 YOUR MOTHER CAN NEVER FIND OUT
 WHAT YOU DID TO EACH OTHER.

08:47.361 --> 08:48.827
YOU WANT ME
TO LIE TO SHAUNA?

08:48.829 --> 08:50.929
THAT PUTS ME IN
A VERY UNCOMFORTABLE POSITION.

08:50.931 --> 08:53.798
     OH, REALLY?
     WELL, IT CAN'T BE
     ANY MORE UNCOMFORTABLE

08:53.800 --> 08:56.301
      THAN THE POSITION
      YOU GUYS WERE IN
      ON THE FERRIS WHEEL!

09:01.675 --> 09:03.375
           (laughter)

09:03.377 --> 09:06.244
   GABI, THIS DINNER
   WAS ABSOLUTELY DELICIOUS.

09:06.246 --> 09:08.213
   AND COMPLETELY UNEVENTFUL.

09:08.215 --> 09:10.465
      -MMM.
      -MOM, DO YOU REALIZE

09:10.466 --> 09:12.716
    THIS IS THE FIRST DINNER
    WE'VE HAD TOGETHER
    IN THREE YEARS?

09:12.719 --> 09:15.587
  -TO MAKING UP FOR LOST TIME.
  -CHEERS!

09:15.589 --> 09:17.489
WELL, GET READY,
'CAUSE NOW IT'S TIME

09:17.491 --> 09:19.824
FOR THE FIRST DESSERT
YOU'VE HAD TOGETHER
IN THREE YEARS.

09:19.826 --> 09:22.527
I'M SO HAPPY.
(giggles)

09:22.529 --> 09:23.962
OH, DON'T WORRY, SHAUNA.
I'VE GOT IT.

09:23.964 --> 09:26.731
     I INSIST. YOU'VE DONE
     SO MUCH FOR ME.

09:26.733 --> 09:28.199
            THANKS.

09:30.304 --> 09:31.636
       I MEAN,
       THIS IS A MIRACLE.

09:31.638 --> 09:33.238
    -THINGS ARE GOING GREAT.
    -I KNOW.

09:33.240 --> 09:35.840
   -SHE DOESN'T HAVE A CLUE.
   -WELL, THANK GOD.

09:35.842 --> 09:38.810
    -I REALLY LIKE YOUR MOM.
    -YEAH, SHE'S GREAT.

09:38.812 --> 09:40.779
          I LOVE HER... SO MUCH,

09:40.781 --> 09:42.981
      -AND YOU KNOW WHAT?
      -WHAT?

09:42.983 --> 09:45.850
       -I LOVE YOU, TOO.
       -(choking)

09:45.852 --> 09:48.353
          I'VE THOUGHT ABOUT YOU
          EVERY SINGLE NIGHT

09:48.355 --> 09:50.422
         EVER SINCE WE MADE LOVE
         ON THAT FERRIS WHEEL.

09:50.424 --> 09:53.258
       IT JUST KEEPS GOING ROUND
       AND ROUND IN MY MIND,

09:53.260 --> 09:55.260
        -LIKE A...
        -I DON'T KNOW--
        FERRIS WHEEL?

09:56.463 --> 09:59.664
                 YES! THAT'S IT!
                 (laughs)

09:59.666 --> 10:01.700
             YOU TOTALLY GET ME,

10:01.702 --> 10:03.501
              AND NOW HERE I AM,

10:03.503 --> 10:07.772
           SITTING NEXT TO YOU.
           IT'S LIKE... DESTINY!

10:09.343 --> 10:12.877
  -WHO'S READY
  FOR DESSERT ON THE TERRACE?
  -I AM, MOMMY!

10:12.879 --> 10:15.246
            OH, AND CAN YOU MAKE
            SOME HOT COCOA?

10:15.248 --> 10:18.316
  -ANYTHING FOR YOU, DARLING.
  -(giggles)

10:18.318 --> 10:20.552
    I THOUGHT SHE'D NEVER LEAVE.

10:20.554 --> 10:23.555
WHAT IS WRONG WITH YOU?
YOU'RE ACTING CRAZY!

10:23.557 --> 10:25.624
         NO, I AM NOT.

10:25.626 --> 10:27.525
        I JUST WANNA
        BITE YOUR NECK!

10:27.527 --> 10:29.427
       -(grunts, giggles)
       -I'LL BE OUTSIDE!

10:29.429 --> 10:33.331
     -WE'LL BE OUTSIDE!
     -PERFECT TIMING.
     I'VE GOT THE DESSERT.

10:35.736 --> 10:38.637
    (chuckles)
    GABI, WE HAVE A PROBLEM.

10:39.606 --> 10:42.340
-DANIELLE'S IN LOVE WITH ME.
-WHAT? WHY WOULD YOU THINK THAT?

10:42.342 --> 10:44.542
SHE SAID, "I LOVE YOU,"
SHE'S NEVER STOPPED LOVING ME...

10:44.544 --> 10:48.580
  -(mimics)
  SHE WANTS TO BITE MY NECK.
  -I SEE WHAT'S GOING ON HERE.

10:48.582 --> 10:50.315
YOU'RE JUST UPSET
BECAUSE I WENT AGAINST
YOUR WISHES,

10:50.317 --> 10:52.784
IT ALL WORKED OUT,
AND YOU CAN'T STAND IT.

10:52.786 --> 10:56.388
     GABI, IS THE WATER WARM YET
     FOR DANIELLE'S COCOA?

10:56.390 --> 10:57.722
EVERYTHING'S READY TO GO.

10:58.825 --> 11:00.325
     HERE YOU GO.

11:00.327 --> 11:02.060
            GO! GO!

11:04.598 --> 11:06.398
           (giggles)

11:07.534 --> 11:09.067
OH, YOU FORGOT
THE MARSHMALLOWS.

11:09.069 --> 11:11.569
                 NO, NO, NO, NO.
                 DON'T GO.

11:13.573 --> 11:16.408
(giggles) HI.

11:17.811 --> 11:20.378
               OKAY, LOOK,
               THIS HAS TO STOP.

11:20.380 --> 11:22.380
YOU'RE RIGHT.
NO, YOU'RE RIGHT.

11:22.382 --> 11:24.849
I CAME HERE
TO FIX MY RELATIONSHIP
WITH MY MOTHER,

11:24.851 --> 11:27.419
SO THIS CAN'T HAPPEN.

11:27.421 --> 11:30.455
         -THANK YOU.
         -BUT THIS CAN.

11:32.492 --> 11:34.025
        (gasps) OH GOD!

11:34.027 --> 11:35.694
I'M JUST SO HAPPY

11:35.696 --> 11:38.329
     THAT YOU AND DANIELLE
     ARE BACK TOGETHER!

11:39.466 --> 11:43.034
   ME TOO. YOU'RE SMUSHING
   THE MARSHMALLOWS, DARLING.

11:43.036 --> 11:45.503
OH, THE ACTUAL MARSHMALLOWS.
(chuckles)

11:47.874 --> 11:50.508
       -HEY, YOU FOUND
       THE MARSHMALLOWS.
       -(giggles)

11:50.510 --> 11:51.976
           -AWESOME.
           -(mouths)

11:51.978 --> 11:54.779
    I JUST NOTICED THE TIME.
    I'VE GOT TO GET DOWN
    TO THE STUDIO.

11:54.781 --> 11:56.881
I'M ON AIR TONIGHT.
JOSH, I TRUST

11:56.883 --> 11:58.950
   -YOU'LL ENTERTAIN
   MY DAUGHTER WHILE I'M OUT.
   -(forcefully) NO!

12:00.020 --> 12:02.721
             I MEAN... GABI?

12:02.723 --> 12:06.124
    UH, I WAS THINKING,
    SINCE YOU HAVE TO WORK,

12:06.126 --> 12:08.860
     MAYBE DANIELLE SHOULD
     COME WITH ME AND SPEND
     THE NIGHT AT MY PLACE.

12:08.862 --> 12:10.495
          -GREAT IDEA.
          -YES.

12:10.497 --> 12:11.863
              NO!

12:11.865 --> 12:15.533
      I... JUST DON'T WANT
      TO BE ANY TROUBLE.

12:15.535 --> 12:16.768
  (sarcastically) REALLY?

12:17.938 --> 12:20.138
   I MEAN, YEAH,
   THAT'S NO TROUBLE AT ALL.

12:20.140 --> 12:22.507
      YEAH, YOU GIRLS RUN
      AND HAVE SOME FUN.

12:22.509 --> 12:24.676
     MAYBE MEET SOME BOYS.
     COME ON, DARLING.

12:24.678 --> 12:26.077
    YOU'VE BEEN STUCK
    IN THE WOODS OF VERMONT.

12:26.079 --> 12:28.480
    WHEN WAS THE LAST TIME
    YOU WENT AND GOT CRAZY?

12:28.482 --> 12:31.850
      -(Danielle laughing)
      -(Gabi forces laugh)

12:31.852 --> 12:33.485
        OKAY, LET'S GO.

12:39.426 --> 12:42.494
            (sighs)
            OKAY, LET'S DO THIS.

12:42.496 --> 12:45.597
        OH MY GOD!
        HOW DID YOU MAKE
        THOSE PAJAMAS?

12:45.599 --> 12:47.499
         DID YOU SKIN
         AN ENTIRE ZOO?

12:48.902 --> 12:50.769
              I LIKE
              YOUR PAJAMAS, TOO.

12:50.771 --> 12:53.538
      DID IT COME WITH BARBIE,
      OR WAS IT SOLD SEPARATELY?

12:54.407 --> 12:57.442
(laughs)
WHICH BED DO YOU SLEEP IN?

12:58.478 --> 13:00.445
    THAT'S FLUFFYKINS' BED.

13:00.447 --> 13:03.014
       HE TURNS IN LATE,
       AFTER <i> LAW & ORDER. </i>

13:05.085 --> 13:08.019
          WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
          I NEED YOU IN THE BED,

13:08.021 --> 13:10.722
            SO I CAN SIMULATE
            HAVING A PERSON NEXT
            TO ME WHILE I SLEEP.

13:10.724 --> 13:12.791
  I'M NOT SIMULATING ANYTHING!

13:12.793 --> 13:14.659
    YOU KNOW WHAT?
    FORGET THIS WHOLE THING.

13:14.661 --> 13:17.095
     I GOT YOU TICKETS TO USHER.
     WE HAD A DEAL!

13:18.031 --> 13:20.999
     FINE! BUT I'M BUILDING
     A PILLOW WALL.

13:21.001 --> 13:24.035
(scoffs)
GETTING INTO BED WITH A MAN
AND NOT TOUCHING HIM.

13:24.037 --> 13:26.171
IT'S LIKE I'M MARRIED
ALL OVER AGAIN.

13:33.613 --> 13:36.014
         SHE WAS KISSING
         HER MOTHER'S BOYFRIEND?

13:36.016 --> 13:38.449
         OOH! I SAW THIS
         ON A <i> TELENOVELA </i> ONCE.

13:38.451 --> 13:40.952
       -DID SHE JUST COME
       OUT OF A COMA?
       -SHH!

13:40.954 --> 13:44.222
   -I DON'T WANT HER TO HEAR.
   -DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT.
   SHE'S IN THE SHOWER.

13:44.224 --> 13:46.191
I MEAN,
THE WHOLE WAY OVER HERE

13:46.193 --> 13:48.193
I WAS TRYING TO CONVINCE HER
THAT IF SHE WENT FOR JOSH,

13:48.195 --> 13:50.595
THEN SHE WOULD
RUIN HER RELATIONSHIP
WITH HER MOTHER FOREVER.

13:50.597 --> 13:52.397
AND YOU KNOW WHAT SHE SAID?

13:52.398 --> 13:54.198
(mimics)
"JOSH TASTES
LIKE COTTON CANDY!"

13:56.036 --> 13:57.902
       I MEAN, SHE'S HERE
       FOR TWO MORE DAYS.

13:57.904 --> 14:00.538
  -WHAT AM I GONNA DO?
  -OH, NO, NO, YOU DON'T HAVE
  TWO MORE DAYS.

14:00.540 --> 14:03.107
 THAT CRAZY BOMB IS TICKING.
 YOU NEED TO GET RID OF HER NOW.

14:03.109 --> 14:05.143
OR-- I MEAN,
WHAT IF I PULL OUT

14:05.145 --> 14:07.645
ALL THE PHOTO ALBUMS
OF ME AND MY MOTHER

14:07.647 --> 14:09.480
AND SHOW HER WHAT
A REAL RELATIONSHIP LOOKS LIKE?

14:09.482 --> 14:11.549
I FEEL LIKE THAT'S WHAT
MY MOM'S TELLING ME TO DO.

14:11.551 --> 14:13.785
           REALLY? LISTEN AGAIN.

14:15.088 --> 14:17.188
  BECAUSE WHAT I'M HEARING IS...

14:17.190 --> 14:18.690
         "DRIVE THAT CRAZY BITCH
         TO THE AIRPORT

14:18.692 --> 14:20.058
         "AND PUT HER
         ON A PLANE TO VERMONT."

14:21.194 --> 14:23.445
YOU KNOW WHAT?
I THINK I'M GONNA GET
OUT THE PHOTO ALBUMS,

14:23.446 --> 14:25.697
  -SO WHEN SHE GETS OUT
  OF THE SHOWER, THEN SHE'S--
  -WAIT, WAIT, WAIT, WAIT.

14:25.699 --> 14:27.565
             SHE'S BEEN IN THERE
             FOR FOREVER.

14:27.567 --> 14:29.634
    SHE SHOULD'VE RUN OUT
    OF HOT WATER 20 MINUTES AGO.

14:31.171 --> 14:32.237
            OH GOD!

14:33.240 --> 14:34.639
OH GOD, OH GOD, OH GOD!

14:34.641 --> 14:36.130
         -(door opens)
         -(gasps)

14:36.131 --> 14:37.620
         MAYBE MY MOM REALLY WAS
         TALKING TO YOU,

14:37.621 --> 14:39.110
BECAUSE THAT CRAZY BITCH
CLIMBED OUT THE BATHROOM WINDOW!

14:39.112 --> 14:41.746
     -(gasps)
     -(door opens, closes)

14:41.748 --> 14:43.615
   JUST LIKE THE <i> TELENOVELA. </i>

14:51.558 --> 14:54.826
      (gasps)
      NO, NO, NO, NO, NO!

14:54.828 --> 14:57.161
        (gasps) NO! NO!

14:59.299 --> 15:02.634
        OH NO, NO, NO,
        NO, NO, NO, NO.

15:02.636 --> 15:04.335
         (gasps)
         DANIEL, STOP!

15:04.337 --> 15:06.704
   JUST BECAUSE YOU ONCE HAD SEX
   WITH JOSH ON A FERRIS WHEEL

15:06.706 --> 15:09.073
      DOESN'T MEAN YOU CAN SNEAK
      INTO BE WITH HIM NOW!

15:09.075 --> 15:10.575
                         (gasps)

15:13.980 --> 15:15.580
         I CAN EXPLAIN.

15:17.000 --> 15:23.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

15:30.063 --> 15:33.564
  I ASKED YOU NOT TO FLY
  SHAUNA'S DAUGHTER OUT HERE,

15:33.566 --> 15:34.666
          BUT YOU DID.

15:35.902 --> 15:37.769
    AND NO ONE WAS
    SUPPOSED TO TELL SHAUNA

15:37.771 --> 15:39.771
       THAT I HAD SEX
       WITH HER DAUGHTER,

15:39.773 --> 15:41.072
          BUT YOU DID.

15:42.042 --> 15:43.574
       MAYBE IT'S GONNA BE OKAY.

15:43.576 --> 15:45.143
     I MEAN, AFTER SHE GETS OVER
     HER INITIAL SHOCK,

15:45.145 --> 15:46.678
    -SHAUNA'S GONNA BE FINE.
    -(door slams)

15:48.081 --> 15:50.882
  JOSH, THESE TWO WEEKS HAVE
  BEEN SOME OF THE BEST TIMES
  I'VE EVER HAD,

15:50.884 --> 15:54.652
  AND I NEVER IMAGINED
  IT WOULD COME TO SUCH
  A HUMILIATING END. GOODBYE!

15:54.654 --> 15:56.120
     SHAUNA, WAIT. (sighs)

15:56.122 --> 15:59.190
       LOOK...
       WE ALL HAVE PASTS.

15:59.192 --> 16:01.225
THE IMPORTANT THING IS
I WANNA BE WITH YOU.

16:01.227 --> 16:04.829
        (emphatically)
        NO, YOU HAD SEX

16:04.831 --> 16:06.764
       WITH MY DAUGHTER!

16:06.766 --> 16:08.833
     WHAT'S THAT THING
     ALL THE AMERICANS SAY?

16:08.835 --> 16:10.702
         OH YEAH. EWW!

16:10.704 --> 16:12.637
       (cellphone beeps)

16:12.639 --> 16:14.205
              OH, IT'S DANIELLE.

16:14.207 --> 16:17.141
    "MOM, MAPLE SYRUP EMERGENCY.
    HAD TO FLY HOME.

16:17.143 --> 16:19.310
      "SO THRILLED
      ABOUT YOU AND JOSH, AND...

16:19.312 --> 16:22.146
"I LOVED SEEING YOU SO HAPPY.
KISS, HUG, DANIELLE."

16:22.148 --> 16:25.249
    (gasps) SEE? SEE?
    SHE CHOSE YOU OVER JOSH.

16:25.251 --> 16:26.918
     I DID THE RIGHT THING.

16:26.920 --> 16:29.654
        I GUESS,
        IN A FUNNY WAY, YOU DID.

16:29.656 --> 16:31.222
                  GOODBYE, GABI.

16:32.625 --> 16:33.858
         GOODBYE, JOSH.

16:35.962 --> 16:40.631
         UH! HUGS ARE
         FOR PEOPLE WHO HAVEN'T
         SLEPT WITH MY DAUGHTER.

16:49.209 --> 16:50.675
                     WHY?

16:51.778 --> 16:53.778
                WHY? WHY?

16:53.780 --> 16:57.081
                  (shouting)
                  WHY? WHY? WHY?

16:57.083 --> 17:00.184
        WHY? WHY, WHY, WHY? WHY?

17:00.186 --> 17:02.820
     WHY? YOU KNOW WHAT?
     DON'T ANSWER THAT QUESTION!

17:02.822 --> 17:03.955
                   GET OUT!

17:06.192 --> 17:07.759
       -(inhales sharply)
       -OUT!

17:18.838 --> 17:21.071
                ¶ ALAN. ¶

17:21.074 --> 17:23.273
               I WOULD SAY,
               "RISE AND SHINE,"

17:23.276 --> 17:25.810
           BUT IT APPEARS
           SOMEBODY ALREADY HAS.

17:26.780 --> 17:28.346
I'M NOT ALAN,

17:28.348 --> 17:30.248
AND THAT'S ONE
OF MY HAIR ROLLERS!

17:30.250 --> 17:33.718
                    AH! YOLANDA!

17:33.720 --> 17:34.886
              YOU WERE SUPPOSED
              TO BE WATCHING ME,

17:34.888 --> 17:37.088
         NOT GETTING
         YOUR WOMAN STINK ON ME.

17:38.324 --> 17:41.192
I'M SORRY!
I CLOSED MY EYES
FOR ONE SECOND,

17:41.194 --> 17:44.829
NEXT THING I KNOW,
I WOKE UP SPOONING
AN ASIAN DANNY DeVITO.

17:46.032 --> 17:48.433
              WAIT, SO YOU SLEPT
              THE WHOLE NIGHT?

17:48.435 --> 17:50.301
               YOU DIDN'T SEE ME
               DO ANYTHING?

17:50.303 --> 17:54.005
OH, RELAX!
WE BOTH SLEPT
THROUGH THE NIGHT.

17:54.007 --> 17:56.040
WHAT'S THE WEIRDEST THING
THAT COULD'VE HAPPENED?
(laughs)

17:59.712 --> 18:02.547
            WAIT.
            HOW DID YOU GET MY--

18:02.549 --> 18:04.148
AND HOW DID YOU
MANAGE TO PUT ON...

18:05.285 --> 18:07.251
        (both screaming)

18:09.355 --> 18:11.389
                (knocks on door)

18:13.293 --> 18:14.425
              (gasps)

18:16.463 --> 18:19.764
      WHY ARE YOU HERE?
      THAT CAN'T BE GOOD.

18:19.766 --> 18:21.265
            GABI, OPEN THE DOOR.

18:25.338 --> 18:28.806
OKAY, FIRST,
LET ME START BY SAYING
I'M REALLY, REALLY SORRY

18:28.808 --> 18:30.908
ABOUT EVERYTHING,
AND TO MAKE IT UP TO YOU,
I MADE YOUR FAVORITE DISH.

18:30.910 --> 18:34.078
  -TRUFFLE MAC AND CHEESE?
  -YOUR SECOND FAVORITE DISH.

18:36.182 --> 18:38.883
    SOFIA CALLED ME,
    AND I KNOW IT WAS YOUR
    MOTHER'S BIRTHDAY THIS WEEK.

18:39.986 --> 18:42.854
   -OH.
   -AND I THINK THAT EXPLAINS
   YOUR BEHAVIOR YESTERDAY.

18:42.856 --> 18:44.822
            NOT EVERY OTHER DAY.

18:46.092 --> 18:48.526
I GUESS THIS TIME
OF YEAR'S REALLY HARD FOR ME.

18:48.528 --> 18:51.195
           I WANT YOU TO KNOW
           MY DOOR'S ALWAYS OPEN
           IF YOU NEED TO TALK.

18:52.198 --> 18:53.798
            NOT MY BEDROOM DOOR.

18:54.868 --> 18:58.836
I GUESS AFTER YOU SAID,
"WHY? WHY? WHY? WHY? WHY?"

18:58.838 --> 19:01.572
IT REALLY
MADE ME THINK, "WHY?"

19:04.144 --> 19:08.045
AND I REALIZED I WAS JUST
TRYING TO LIVE VICARIOUSLY
THROUGH DANIELLE AND SHAUNA.

19:08.047 --> 19:11.315
I THOUGHT MAYBE
IF I COULD GET THEM
BACK TOGETHER, THEN...

19:11.317 --> 19:12.850
        GOD, I WOULD DO
        ANYTHING TO HAVE

19:12.852 --> 19:14.919
     ONE MORE MOMENT
     WITH MY MOM. (crying)

19:14.921 --> 19:15.786
            I KNOW...

19:15.788 --> 19:18.856
  WHICH IS WHY I'M GIVING YOU
  THE REST OF THE WEEK OFF

19:18.858 --> 19:20.424
     AND SENDING YOU
     AND SOFIA ON A LITTLE TRIP.

19:20.426 --> 19:22.260
WHAT? WHERE ARE WE GOING?

19:22.262 --> 19:25.963
    LET ME...
    GIVE YOU A LITTLE HINT.

19:26.866 --> 19:28.966
     JULIA CHILD'S KITCHEN
     IN THE SMITHSONIAN?

19:28.968 --> 19:31.802
    -MY MOM ALWAYS
    WANTED TO TAKE ME HERE.
    -I KNOW.

19:31.804 --> 19:33.838
SOFIA ALREADY PACKED YOUR BAGS.
SHE'S MEETING US AT THE AIRPORT.

19:33.840 --> 19:36.207
  WAIT, WAIT, WAIT.
  I RUINED YOUR RELATIONSHIP,

19:36.209 --> 19:37.441
     AND YOU'RE SENDING ME
     ON A FREE TRIP?

19:37.443 --> 19:38.876
      I SHOULD NOT
      HAVE MENTIONED THAT.

19:40.813 --> 19:43.314
AT LEAST LET ME
GIVE YOU THE CHICKEN PARM
THAT I MADE YOU.

19:43.316 --> 19:46.350
        CHICKEN PARM?
        NOT EVEN TOP 10.

19:48.555 --> 19:50.288
WAIT, WAIT,
WAIT, WAIT, WAIT.

19:50.290 --> 19:51.989
        ONE MORE THING.

19:53.026 --> 19:54.592
                 (chuckles)

19:54.594 --> 19:55.993
           THANK YOU.

20:07.240 --> 20:09.040
ELLIOT, I HAVE SOMETHING
TO TELL YOU.

20:09.042 --> 20:11.876
 -WHAT?
 -I'VE BEEN HAVING A HARD TIME
 SLEEPING NEXT TO YOU.

20:11.878 --> 20:14.178
I'M SO WORRIED THAT I MIGHT
DO SOMETHING IN MY SLEEP

20:14.180 --> 20:15.446
AND YOU WON'T THINK
I'M SEXY ANYMORE.

20:15.448 --> 20:16.614
            -WHAT?
            -I KNOW.

20:16.616 --> 20:17.882
WITH THIS MONEYMAKER,
THAT'S CRAZY.

20:17.884 --> 20:19.217
BUT WHAT IF?

20:21.354 --> 20:22.853
             YOU'VE BEEN WORRIED
             ABOUT THAT?

20:22.855 --> 20:24.855
           I'VE BEEN WORRIED
           ABOUT THE SAME THING!

20:24.857 --> 20:27.024
OH PLEASE.
YOU DON'T KNOW FROM WORRY.

20:28.461 --> 20:30.962
               I DON'T?
               I WAS SO WORRIED,

20:30.964 --> 20:32.930
              I PAID YOLANDA
              TO WATCH ME SLEEP.

20:32.932 --> 20:35.299
THAT'S SO SWEET!

20:35.301 --> 20:37.134
        -DID YOU DO
        ANYTHING WEIRD?
        -NO.

20:38.071 --> 20:41.005
THIS IS CRAZY.
WHO CARES WHAT
WE DO IN OUR SLEEP?

20:41.007 --> 20:44.008
WE CAN BE OURSELVES.
WE LOVE EACH OTHER.

20:45.445 --> 20:50.114
         -WE DO?
         -WELL... I DO.

20:52.652 --> 20:54.652
          -I DO TOO.
          -(chuckles)

20:57.390 --> 21:00.458
GOOD, BECAUSE I HAVE
SLEEP APNEA.

21:03.997 --> 21:05.663
(muffled)
GOOD NIGHT, SWEETHEART.

21:06.966 --> 21:08.099
                    NIGHT.

21:14.040 --> 21:16.040
           YAY.

21:16.042 --> 21:18.976
(machine hissing)

21:21.948 --> 21:23.914
         OH, WHO CARES?

21:23.916 --> 21:26.083
              YAY.
