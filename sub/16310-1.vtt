00:54.161 --> 00:56.161
Evening, Walter.

01:00.292 --> 01:02.025
Any problems?

01:02.825 --> 01:04.724
Nah.

01:04.727 --> 01:08.022
Just walked it straight
out of the evidence room.

01:08.024 --> 01:10.590
And you're sure no one will miss it?

01:10.592 --> 01:12.322
God, no!

01:12.324 --> 01:14.923
Nobody believes that crackpot story anyway.

01:14.925 --> 01:18.491
The case is closed as
far as we're concerned.

01:20.990 --> 01:22.289
Good.

01:24.622 --> 01:27.088
You got the money?

01:38.656 --> 01:40.951
And don't count it in front of me.

01:40.953 --> 01:42.853
It's bad manners.

01:45.887 --> 01:47.786
Of course...

01:52.888 --> 01:54.954
I trust you.

01:59.319 --> 02:01.553
Now, get the fuck out of here.

02:01.555 --> 02:03.520
This isn't a social visit.

02:44.049 --> 02:47.081
<i>There is a legend around here.</i>

02:49.481 --> 02:51.647
<i>A vintage doll</i>

02:53.046 --> 02:56.712
<i>possessed by a vengeful spirit.</i>

02:58.879 --> 03:04.711
<i>Evil lurking within a symbol
of childhood innocence.</i>

03:07.513 --> 03:13.712
<i>It's said that a curse will pass
to all those who own the doll.</i>

03:15.712 --> 03:17.878
<i>A death curse.</i>

03:20.711 --> 03:25.975
<i>Only a few have seen the doll
and lived to tell the tale.</i>

03:28.644 --> 03:32.109
<i>Some have even tried to destroy it.</i>

03:34.477 --> 03:37.609
<i>But no one has succeeded.</i>

03:40.041 --> 03:42.639
<i>Robert is watching...</i>

03:43.544 --> 03:45.609
<i>...waiting...</i>

03:46.876 --> 03:50.440
<i>Ready to inflict
death and destruction</i>

03:50.442 --> 03:54.042
<i>on anyone who crosses his path.</i>

07:01.022 --> 07:03.284
Oh... Can we help you?

07:03.286 --> 07:05.652
Hi, I'm the new cleaning assistant.

07:05.654 --> 07:07.685
Uh, Walter Berenson hired me.

07:07.687 --> 07:09.451
I'm supposed to meet a lady named Ethel.

07:09.453 --> 07:10.619
Oh, she's inside.

07:10.621 --> 07:12.285
Okay, thanks.

07:12.287 --> 07:14.719
Uh, one piece of advice, little lady.

07:14.721 --> 07:16.585
Yeah?

07:16.587 --> 07:19.286
I've got my name on a
bunch of stuff in there.

07:19.288 --> 07:20.649
He means that literally, you know.

07:20.651 --> 07:22.384
He wrote his name on
milk cartons and stuff.

07:22.386 --> 07:24.750
Shut up!

07:24.752 --> 07:29.516
Some people who've worked here
before chose to ignore those labels.

07:29.518 --> 07:32.950
They ate my food, stole my teabags.

07:32.952 --> 07:35.616
I don't like those people.

07:35.618 --> 07:37.916
I want to like you.

07:37.918 --> 07:43.049
So when you get in there,
don't give me a reason not to.

07:43.518 --> 07:45.480
Uh, okay.

07:45.482 --> 07:47.848
Lighten up, Stan! Come
on, let's get to work.

07:57.318 --> 07:58.580
You looking for me?

07:58.582 --> 07:59.813
Ethel?

07:59.815 --> 08:00.948
- Yeah?
- Hi.

08:00.950 --> 08:02.946
I'm Emily, the new cleaning assistant.

08:02.948 --> 08:05.346
Walter said you'd show me around.

08:05.348 --> 08:07.445
Walter.

08:07.447 --> 08:09.113
That guy's a prick.

08:10.616 --> 08:14.614
He has got no idea the work
that we put in down here.

08:14.616 --> 08:19.148
Too busy at his country club, hob
nobbing with the other rich dickheads.

08:19.913 --> 08:21.413
Anyway...

08:21.415 --> 08:23.114
Sit down, love.

08:28.780 --> 08:31.144
- Coffee?
- Oh, yes please.

08:34.611 --> 08:36.244
Ah.

08:36.246 --> 08:37.943
You'll be needing this.

08:37.946 --> 08:39.510
Thanks.

08:40.279 --> 08:42.577
So, this job.

08:42.578 --> 08:44.343
Part of your life's plan, is it?

08:44.345 --> 08:46.577
Always wanted to clear
up after other people?

08:46.579 --> 08:48.077
Not exactly.

08:48.679 --> 08:50.509
I'm a student.

08:50.511 --> 08:52.342
I needed some extra cash
and this job came up.

08:52.344 --> 08:54.874
I'm a night owl anyway, so
the late shifts will suit me.

08:54.876 --> 08:56.609
Yeah?

08:56.611 --> 08:58.675
Well, I've been working
nights for over a decade

08:58.677 --> 09:00.941
and it's no walk in the
park, I can tell you.

09:00.943 --> 09:03.407
Your body clock gets all screwed up.

09:03.409 --> 09:07.207
Even on your day off you're hungry
at two o'clock in the morning,

09:07.209 --> 09:11.207
because your body still
thinks it's time for lunch.

09:11.209 --> 09:13.273
Skin and hair go to shit, too.

09:13.275 --> 09:15.542
Anything good about
working the night shift?

09:16.441 --> 09:19.404
Yeah.

09:19.406 --> 09:23.737
Knocking off at 8:00 a.m. means it's socially
acceptable to drink vodka in the morning!

09:29.241 --> 09:32.270
This is 1940's War Time.

09:32.272 --> 09:34.238
One of the sections you'll be assigned to.

09:34.240 --> 09:35.538
Okay.

09:35.540 --> 09:38.436
You'll be dusting and polishing in here.

09:38.438 --> 09:41.370
As well as brushing and mopping the floor.

09:41.372 --> 09:43.537
As I said, you know,
it's not rocket science,

09:43.539 --> 09:45.269
no need to over complicate things.

09:45.271 --> 09:46.903
Okay.

09:46.905 --> 09:50.601
We get a lot of people
coming through here every day.

09:50.603 --> 09:54.769
One thing you learn about people
is that they are disgusting.

09:54.771 --> 09:59.768
They eat food or wipe snot on their
hands, then they touch the exhibits!

09:59.770 --> 10:02.835
They leave greasy hand prints everywhere.

10:02.837 --> 10:07.069
I mean, especially on the glass
cases. Make sure to get those off.

10:09.205 --> 10:11.668
It's kids mostly.

10:11.670 --> 10:13.001
- You got any?
- No.

10:13.003 --> 10:14.867
Huh. Me neither.

10:14.869 --> 10:17.033
I'm barren, thank Christ.

10:23.968 --> 10:25.866
Everything you need is in here.

10:25.868 --> 10:27.999
Pretty obvious, really.

10:28.001 --> 10:30.332
I'm assuming you're not a moron,

10:30.334 --> 10:32.431
so I don't expect you to do any crazy shit,

10:32.433 --> 10:34.898
like get bleach on any
of the mannequin uniforms.

10:34.900 --> 10:36.230
Of course not.

10:36.232 --> 10:38.531
That's what one cleaning assistant did.

10:38.533 --> 10:40.330
Hence why you're in the hot seat.

10:40.332 --> 10:42.231
All seems pretty straight forward.

10:42.233 --> 10:43.596
Just use a bit of initiative,

10:43.598 --> 10:45.430
don't bring any drama to my door

10:45.432 --> 10:46.798
and we'll get along just fine.

10:46.800 --> 10:48.565
Okay.

10:52.897 --> 10:56.861
Now let me show you our newest exhibit.

10:56.863 --> 10:58.796
Another section you'll be responsible for.

10:58.798 --> 11:00.196
Okay.

11:00.198 --> 11:02.528
It's not my cup of tea.

11:02.530 --> 11:04.826
I don't understand it.

11:04.828 --> 11:07.361
People flock to see this thing.

11:07.363 --> 11:10.996
So there'll be plenty of hand
prints left on the glass each night.

11:11.596 --> 11:12.929
What's that all about?

11:12.931 --> 11:14.763
- What?
- The sign.

11:15.662 --> 11:17.760
Oh, that.

11:17.762 --> 11:21.958
Just some money making
scheme that Walter's into.

11:21.960 --> 11:24.459
He tells everyone that the doll is haunted.

11:24.461 --> 11:29.326
So the ghost obsessed ghouls
come here to take pictures.

11:29.328 --> 11:32.892
He gets a tour guide to tell them

11:32.894 --> 11:35.358
that if they don't ask Robert's
permission to take a photo,

11:35.360 --> 11:36.691
that the doll will put a curse on them.

11:36.693 --> 11:39.457
Sounds interesting.

11:39.459 --> 11:43.622
The museum was dead before
this thing came here.

11:43.624 --> 11:46.225
Now all of a sudden, people are flocking.

11:46.227 --> 11:48.390
So you don't believe in
the supernatural, then?

11:48.392 --> 11:51.292
Just a load of rubbish if you ask me.

11:51.294 --> 11:53.689
People play it up to make money.

11:53.691 --> 11:55.524
Anyway, let's get on.

11:59.890 --> 12:01.389
Emily?

12:01.391 --> 12:03.190
Yeah?

12:03.192 --> 12:04.820
Don't let your imagination
run away with you.

12:04.822 --> 12:06.422
I won't.

13:42.979 --> 13:47.712
Hi, guys. Sorry to bother you. How many
of us are on the night shift tonight?

13:47.714 --> 13:48.845
Why?

13:48.847 --> 13:50.479
I'm just curious.

13:51.180 --> 13:53.545
Uh, you, Ethel, and us two.

13:53.547 --> 13:55.177
Right.

13:55.179 --> 13:56.677
What's up?

13:56.679 --> 13:59.310
I just thought I saw
someone in the corridor.

13:59.312 --> 14:02.177
Well, it wasn't either of us, sweetheart.

14:02.179 --> 14:05.643
Yeah, I can see you're really busy.

14:05.645 --> 14:09.276
How much of the building
does this CCTV cover?

14:09.278 --> 14:11.909
Uh, just the main entrance,
couple of corridors.

14:11.911 --> 14:13.909
Berenson's too tight to give us a system

14:13.911 --> 14:15.741
that actually covers the entire building.

14:15.743 --> 14:17.641
Do you think you can rewind
the tape and check it out?

14:17.643 --> 14:20.307
Now why would we need to do that?

14:20.309 --> 14:23.742
I just thought I saw someone in the
corridor and wanted to know who it was.

14:23.744 --> 14:26.507
It was probably Ethel
sneaking off for a fag,

14:26.509 --> 14:28.273
and leaving you to do all the work.

14:28.275 --> 14:29.941
I don't think it was.

14:29.943 --> 14:31.642
So what are you saying? You think
someone's trespassing, or what?

14:31.644 --> 14:32.906
I don't know.

14:32.908 --> 14:35.407
Oh, give over, love.

14:35.409 --> 14:37.605
Who would want to break
into this place, eh?

14:37.607 --> 14:41.372
All that's here is some dusty
old shit no one actually wants.

14:41.374 --> 14:42.939
I don't mind checking things out.

14:42.941 --> 14:44.673
Are you sure?

14:44.675 --> 14:47.238
Nah, it's cool. I'll have a walk around.

14:47.240 --> 14:49.207
See if anything's wrong.

14:49.209 --> 14:50.740
Thanks.

15:01.741 --> 15:03.073
Hi.

15:03.772 --> 15:05.671
Hi.

15:05.673 --> 15:08.336
Uh, I did a thorough check and
everything seems to be okay.

15:08.338 --> 15:10.371
I must have got it wrong.

15:10.373 --> 15:12.435
I could have sworn I saw someone.

15:12.437 --> 15:15.334
Well, everything's as
it should be, but, um...

15:15.336 --> 15:17.535
Don't hesitate to give me a shout
if anything concerns you, all right?

15:17.537 --> 15:19.168
Okay.

15:19.170 --> 15:20.902
It's what I'm here for.

15:21.804 --> 15:23.235
Thanks.

15:23.237 --> 15:26.168
Um, ignore Stan.

15:26.170 --> 15:28.536
He's getting a bit grumpy in his old age.

15:29.702 --> 15:31.635
Okay, thanks.

15:37.903 --> 15:40.035
You didn't waste any time.

15:41.268 --> 15:43.333
You what?

15:43.335 --> 15:46.500
Playing the damsel in distress for
the handsome young security guard.

15:46.502 --> 15:48.667
No it wasn't like that. He...

15:48.669 --> 15:50.832
- I thought I saw someone in the corridor...
- Nah.

15:50.834 --> 15:54.197
Don't need to make excuses.

15:54.199 --> 15:56.666
If I was 20 years younger,
I'd certainly give him one.

17:46.756 --> 17:48.686
I need to show you something.

17:48.688 --> 17:51.688
- Well, what is it?
- Just come and look.

17:57.854 --> 17:59.886
Over here, look.

18:02.954 --> 18:06.152
What the hell am I
supposed to be seeing here?

18:06.154 --> 18:08.420
Wait, that's not right.

18:14.785 --> 18:17.281
What?

18:17.283 --> 18:19.450
There were hand prints on the glass.

18:19.452 --> 18:22.616
I told you, people touch the
exhibits with their dirty hands.

18:22.618 --> 18:24.215
No, you don't understand.

18:24.217 --> 18:26.382
The hand prints were on
the inside of the glass.

18:26.384 --> 18:28.550
So, what are you saying exactly?

18:29.286 --> 18:30.614
I don't know...

18:30.616 --> 18:33.249
The doll was...

18:33.251 --> 18:34.914
You feeling all right?

18:34.916 --> 18:38.447
I don't know. Maybe the night
shifts are getting to me.

18:38.449 --> 18:40.780
God, love, it's only your second night.

18:40.782 --> 18:43.779
If you're going loopy on me already,
perhaps this ain't the job for you.

18:43.781 --> 18:46.381
It's just... I saw the hand prints.

18:46.383 --> 18:49.213
They were there before I came
to find you and now they're gone.

18:49.215 --> 18:51.211
It's my fault.

18:51.213 --> 18:53.613
I filled your head with
all that crap about the doll

18:53.615 --> 18:55.380
and it's getting to you.

18:57.282 --> 18:59.014
Come on, let's have a break.

19:12.545 --> 19:13.711
How you doing?

19:13.713 --> 19:15.011
Hey.

19:18.179 --> 19:20.511
You can go ahead, Stan. I'll catch up.

19:26.677 --> 19:29.909
I've got a pretty good emotional radar.

19:29.911 --> 19:31.875
What's wrong?

19:31.877 --> 19:35.941
Either I'm going crazy, or
there's something strange going on.

19:35.943 --> 19:37.841
Well, what do you think's going on?

19:37.843 --> 19:41.176
I don't know but I'm getting
a bad feeling about that doll.

19:41.178 --> 19:42.541
What? Robert the Doll?

19:42.543 --> 19:45.208
- Yeah.
- Is he creeping you out?

19:45.210 --> 19:47.207
A bit.

19:47.209 --> 19:50.573
The thing is, I saw these hand
prints on the doll's glass case.

19:50.575 --> 19:52.873
They looked like the doll's hand prints.

19:52.875 --> 19:54.938
Really?

19:54.940 --> 19:56.774
Somebody playing a joke?

19:56.776 --> 19:58.340
I don't know, maybe.

19:58.342 --> 19:59.938
Stan and Ethel into practical jokes?

19:59.940 --> 20:02.074
Definitely not!

20:03.639 --> 20:05.638
Maybe someone working in the day did it.

20:05.640 --> 20:08.205
Well, what else could it be?

20:08.207 --> 20:11.540
Sounds crazy, but maybe what
they say about the doll is true.

20:11.542 --> 20:13.271
What? All that haunted stuff?

20:13.273 --> 20:15.870
- Yeah.
- Do you believe in all that?

20:15.872 --> 20:17.605
Not really.

20:17.607 --> 20:19.539
But, I don't know, since
I've been working here,

20:19.541 --> 20:22.636
I've seen things I don't have
a rational explanation for.

20:22.638 --> 20:24.536
Have you seen anything strange?

20:24.538 --> 20:26.503
Hmm. No.

20:26.505 --> 20:29.902
But I gotta be honest. This job doesn't
exactly require much concentration.

20:29.904 --> 20:32.337
I mean, nothing happens here.

20:32.339 --> 20:34.568
Kinda just zone out most of the time.

20:34.570 --> 20:38.469
I tell you what. I'll be a bit
more vigilant from now on, yeah?

20:38.471 --> 20:41.801
Do you think I'm crazy?

20:41.803 --> 20:44.401
Well, I don't know you that
well, so I can't say for sure.

20:44.403 --> 20:46.400
I guess not.

20:46.402 --> 20:47.567
But I'd like to.

20:47.569 --> 20:48.802
What?

20:48.804 --> 20:50.536
Get to know you.

20:52.504 --> 20:56.300
After work I usually go to this
24 hour diner around the corner,

20:56.302 --> 20:59.398
I was just wondering if you
wanted to come with me tonight?

20:59.400 --> 21:01.199
Uh...

21:01.201 --> 21:04.199
Uh, sorry, that was a bit
forward. Don't worry about it.

21:04.201 --> 21:05.800
I didn't mean to make
you feel uncomfortable...

21:05.802 --> 21:08.534
- No, I'd like to.
- Don't worry about it...

21:09.135 --> 21:10.466
You would?

21:10.468 --> 21:11.698
Yeah.

21:11.700 --> 21:14.366
Oh, okay, great.

21:14.368 --> 21:17.365
I'll meet you in reception at 8:00, then?

21:17.367 --> 21:19.199
Sure.

21:19.201 --> 21:22.298
Cool. I, uh, better catch up with Stan.

21:22.300 --> 21:23.896
Yeah, I better get back to work.

21:23.898 --> 21:25.663
- I'll see you later.
- See you later.

21:25.665 --> 21:27.431
- See you.
- Bye.

21:32.263 --> 21:34.329
So, um, what are you studying?

21:34.331 --> 21:36.198
Sociology.

21:36.200 --> 21:38.828
- Sounds interesting.
- It's not, really.

21:38.830 --> 21:40.728
To be honest I only took
it because I didn't know

21:40.730 --> 21:42.697
what to do after finishing school.

21:42.699 --> 21:45.561
I had a couple of years
off, worked a few jobs.

21:45.563 --> 21:49.560
Nothing really worked out, so
I decided to go back to Uni.

21:49.562 --> 21:51.695
Yeah, I know what you mean.

21:51.697 --> 21:54.227
I wanted to be a photographer.

21:54.229 --> 21:56.494
But photography didn't pay the bills.

21:56.496 --> 21:59.360
So I took the security work.

21:59.362 --> 22:02.326
I mean, at first I still
called myself a photographer,

22:02.328 --> 22:04.728
and security was just a temp thing.

22:05.830 --> 22:07.696
But now?

22:10.263 --> 22:14.559
Now I have to be honest with people
when they ask me what I do for a living.

22:14.561 --> 22:16.527
I'm a security guard.

22:17.828 --> 22:19.924
Still plenty of time to follow your dream.

22:19.926 --> 22:21.391
Yeah, I guess so.

22:21.393 --> 22:22.692
At least you know what your dream is.

22:24.527 --> 22:26.725
So, uh...

22:26.727 --> 22:29.892
How are you feeling about
everything at the museum now then?

22:30.327 --> 22:31.789
Not great.

22:31.791 --> 22:34.056
Helps to know that you'll be there though.

23:08.122 --> 23:10.520
Just going for a walk through.

23:10.522 --> 23:12.454
All right, I'll get the next one.

26:43.600 --> 26:45.333
Bloody thing...

26:49.900 --> 26:51.633
Oh, God.

26:51.833 --> 26:53.230
There you go.

26:53.232 --> 26:55.065
Got ya, you bastard.

27:45.691 --> 27:47.124
Stan?

28:03.225 --> 28:05.390
Stan, you in here, mate?

28:38.488 --> 28:40.354
Stan?

28:43.320 --> 28:44.986
Stan?

28:55.652 --> 28:57.384
Stan?

29:37.116 --> 29:39.844
So, uh... Mrs. Mason.

29:39.846 --> 29:42.880
So, you were in the staff room
between 1:00 a.m. and 1:30?

29:42.882 --> 29:44.410
That's right.

29:44.412 --> 29:46.245
Just you, all on your own?

29:46.247 --> 29:48.311
Yes.

29:48.313 --> 29:50.745
I was there, too, but I popped
out to make a phone call.

29:50.747 --> 29:54.145
Oh, how long did you pop out for?

29:54.147 --> 29:56.579
I was on the phone for about 20 minutes.

29:57.746 --> 30:00.512
What about you? Uh, Kevin.

30:00.514 --> 30:02.610
Where were you when all this was going off?

30:02.612 --> 30:05.309
I was in the security station.

30:05.311 --> 30:09.178
So you went to look for Mr.
Graves about 1:30, correct?

30:09.180 --> 30:10.643
Yeah.

30:10.645 --> 30:12.510
He'd been gone for about 45 minutes

30:12.512 --> 30:13.875
and it doesn't take that
long to do a walk through.

30:15.145 --> 30:16.710
Shit, it's Berenson.

30:18.644 --> 30:21.410
Somebody wanna tell me what the
hell is going on around here?

30:21.412 --> 30:23.477
Mr. Berenson.

30:24.211 --> 30:25.375
Yes.

30:25.377 --> 30:26.707
Detective Atkins.

30:26.709 --> 30:29.474
I was told an employee was hurt.

30:29.476 --> 30:31.339
It's a bit more serious than that.

30:31.341 --> 30:34.907
Your employee, Mr. Graves, is dead.

30:38.477 --> 30:41.074
You planning on turning my
museum into a crime scene?

30:41.076 --> 30:42.407
- Just a moment...
- Just calm down a sec...

30:42.409 --> 30:45.506
We open to the public at 9:00 a.m.

30:45.508 --> 30:47.605
I certainly hope you'll be done by then.

30:47.607 --> 30:50.073
Oh, I'm fairly sure we will be.

30:50.475 --> 30:51.740
Good.

30:51.742 --> 30:53.974
If I could just have a word in private.

30:56.773 --> 30:58.272
Why?

30:58.274 --> 31:00.805
Oh, just be good to go
through a few things.

31:02.407 --> 31:05.736
We can use my office.

31:05.738 --> 31:10.570
Sardy, just get phone numbers and
addresses off the staff, will you?

31:10.572 --> 31:13.469
- Yeah.
- We're going to have to contact them again.

31:13.471 --> 31:15.569
All right, let's get your name, darling.

31:15.571 --> 31:17.335
Emily Barker.

31:17.337 --> 31:20.403
And what's your phone number, Emily?

31:20.806 --> 31:26.037
0-77-16-364-29.

31:31.670 --> 31:33.836
You thinking about Stan?

31:35.403 --> 31:36.769
Yeah...

31:38.104 --> 31:40.434
I know he was grumpy,

31:40.436 --> 31:42.569
but he was a good guy deep down.

31:43.168 --> 31:44.833
I'm sure he was.

31:44.835 --> 31:46.700
Was he married?

31:46.702 --> 31:50.100
Nah, he never had any kids either.

31:50.102 --> 31:53.035
It's kinda sad that he didn't
leave anyone special behind.

31:54.635 --> 31:57.166
This might not be the right time to say it,

31:57.168 --> 32:00.601
but there's something strange
going on at that museum.

32:01.700 --> 32:03.465
The doll?

32:03.467 --> 32:05.831
Yeah.

32:05.833 --> 32:10.431
I know it sounds like I've lost
my mind, but I know what I've seen.

32:10.433 --> 32:12.862
Ethel said people believe
the doll is possessed

32:12.864 --> 32:16.861
and I can't help but
think it might be true.

32:16.863 --> 32:19.564
I really don't know if I
can go back there, you know.

32:19.566 --> 32:21.494
You're thinking about quitting?

32:21.496 --> 32:23.296
To be honest, yeah.

32:23.298 --> 32:24.564
Perhaps you should, too.

32:24.566 --> 32:26.128
I can't. I've got bills to pay!

32:26.130 --> 32:29.329
So have I, but I can't help feeling

32:29.331 --> 32:30.761
more bad stuff is going to happen.

32:30.763 --> 32:32.328
Don't quit.

32:32.330 --> 32:34.460
Not yet.

32:34.462 --> 32:37.763
I'll be there, I won't
let anything happen to you.

32:37.765 --> 32:40.031
Why do you care what happens to me?

32:40.630 --> 32:42.328
Because I like you.

32:43.195 --> 32:44.494
You do?

32:44.496 --> 32:45.628
Yeah.

32:45.630 --> 32:47.560
Why?

32:47.562 --> 32:49.561
Is there any reason why I shouldn't?

32:49.563 --> 32:50.859
Yeah, plenty.

32:50.861 --> 32:55.859
I'm awkward, unsociable, and...

33:02.495 --> 33:06.059
You just did that to
shut me up, didn't you?

33:06.061 --> 33:08.326
You don't know how beautiful you are.

33:09.261 --> 33:10.324
I'm not.

33:10.326 --> 33:11.824
Yes, you are.

33:39.191 --> 33:40.456
Hey, Ethel.

33:40.458 --> 33:42.387
Hmm?

33:42.389 --> 33:44.755
Would you mind taking the
Robert exhibition for me tonight?

33:44.757 --> 33:46.153
Why?

33:46.155 --> 33:49.522
I just can't face going down there.

33:49.524 --> 33:54.253
After what happened to Stan it won't be a
barrel of laughs for me either, sweetheart.

33:54.255 --> 33:57.254
I know, I'm sorry. I'll do it, it's fine.

33:57.256 --> 33:59.453
All right.

33:59.455 --> 34:02.553
We can swap if it makes
you feel that uncomfortable.

34:02.555 --> 34:04.055
Thank you.

34:56.349 --> 34:57.681
Hey.

34:58.214 --> 34:59.580
Hi.

34:59.582 --> 35:01.580
You okay?

35:01.582 --> 35:05.046
Yeah, it's just weird without Stan around.

35:05.048 --> 35:06.147
Yeah.

35:06.149 --> 35:07.479
Must be difficult.

35:07.481 --> 35:09.547
Just takes some getting used to.

35:19.446 --> 35:21.579
Oh, for Christ's sake!

35:35.746 --> 35:42.208
Um, what happened
between us, at your place.

35:42.210 --> 35:45.076
I hope you don't think it
was just a one time thing.

35:48.311 --> 35:51.444
It really meant something to me, you know?

35:53.375 --> 35:55.441
It meant something to me, too.

36:36.639 --> 36:37.835
- What was that?
- Stay here!

36:37.837 --> 36:39.570
No, I'm coming with you!

36:55.171 --> 36:56.669
Em!

37:06.469 --> 37:08.767
So, let's get this straight.

37:08.769 --> 37:10.600
You and Mr... Uh...

37:10.602 --> 37:12.600
- Kevin.
- Yeah, Kevin. Kevin.

37:12.602 --> 37:16.400
When you got to the scene about 11:30-ish,

37:16.402 --> 37:19.532
you found that there was rubbish from
the storage room all over the floor

37:19.534 --> 37:21.399
and the door was open?

37:21.602 --> 37:24.665
Yes.

37:24.667 --> 37:28.032
Why do I have to keep telling
you the same thing over and over?

37:28.034 --> 37:30.730
Just establishing the facts.

37:30.732 --> 37:34.031
I mean, there have been two fatalities

37:34.033 --> 37:36.196
in this location in a matter of days.

37:36.198 --> 37:39.762
I think that raises a
few questions, don't you?

37:39.764 --> 37:41.262
Yes.

37:41.264 --> 37:43.564
But you're asking the wrong person.

37:44.331 --> 37:46.462
Miss Barker.

37:46.464 --> 37:51.627
Have you got something to tell me that
might help with this investigation?

37:51.629 --> 37:55.395
If I told you what I really
think, you'd think I was crazy.

37:56.130 --> 37:57.629
Try me.

38:00.629 --> 38:02.327
All right.

38:05.528 --> 38:09.593
Ever since I started working there,

38:09.595 --> 38:13.558
there's something about that
doll that just doesn't feel right.

38:13.560 --> 38:15.026
Doll?

38:18.128 --> 38:20.327
Yeah.

38:20.329 --> 38:23.425
On the ground floor, there's
an exhibit called Robert.

38:23.427 --> 38:25.393
It's an old, vintage doll.

38:25.395 --> 38:28.793
Oh, that doll your boss claims is haunted

38:28.795 --> 38:31.060
so he can drive ticket prices up?

38:31.493 --> 38:33.192
Yeah.

38:33.194 --> 38:34.927
Only I think it might be true.

38:36.226 --> 38:38.492
And what makes you think that?

38:40.059 --> 38:44.123
I've had a couple of strange experiences.

38:44.125 --> 38:47.958
I saw hand prints that were on the
inside of the doll's glass case.

38:49.224 --> 38:51.789
I swear, I've seen the
doll in the corridors, too.

38:54.325 --> 38:56.755
Well, that's quite a theory, isn't it?

38:56.757 --> 38:58.757
Check the CCTV, for God's sake!

38:58.759 --> 39:00.754
There's cameras all over the building,

39:00.756 --> 39:03.023
the tapes must have picked something up!

39:03.025 --> 39:05.354
No, we've checked the CCTV.

39:05.356 --> 39:07.822
- And?
- Nothing untoward there.

39:11.623 --> 39:13.285
Look, Miss Barker,

39:13.287 --> 39:16.122
I've got to focus all of my efforts

39:16.124 --> 39:19.489
on finding a viable human
suspect for these deaths.

39:21.755 --> 39:23.587
Are you saying I'm a suspect?

39:23.589 --> 39:25.518
I'm saying...

39:25.520 --> 39:30.684
You and your pal Kevin best not
leave town any time soon, eh?

39:33.351 --> 39:36.351
I don't even know why I
was called in as a suspect.

39:36.353 --> 39:38.149
- Are you okay?
- No, I'm not okay!

39:38.151 --> 39:40.384
Well, what did they say?

39:40.386 --> 39:42.384
Stan's death wasn't an accident
and neither was Ethel's.

39:42.386 --> 39:43.817
There was nobody else in the
building, so we're the suspects!

39:43.819 --> 39:45.684
Yeah, they've said the
same thing to me, too.

39:45.686 --> 39:47.017
What the hell are we going to do?

39:47.019 --> 39:48.584
We need to prove that the doll did this.

39:53.819 --> 39:57.782
"Woman claims a possessed doll
murdered her son's babysitter.

39:57.784 --> 40:00.716
"Jennifer Otto, 35, made
the outlandish claim,

40:00.718 --> 40:03.480
"on the day that her son,
10-year-old Eugene Otto,

40:03.482 --> 40:06.750
"was charged with the murder
of 17-year-old Marcie Richmont

40:06.752 --> 40:12.013
"and his own father Paul,
a 36-year-old lawyer."

40:12.015 --> 40:14.714
Hey, Em, come and check this out.

40:20.215 --> 40:22.379
"Mother of murderous child committed.

40:22.381 --> 40:25.212
"Jennifer Otto, whose son,
Eugene was found guilty

40:25.214 --> 40:27.247
"of the murder of his father, Paul Otto,

40:27.249 --> 40:30.445
"has today been committed to the
East State Mental Health Hospital.

40:30.447 --> 40:33.612
"Mrs. Otto, 35, claimed that
a doll given to their son

40:33.614 --> 40:36.279
"by their now deceased
housekeeper, Agatha Blackwood,

40:36.281 --> 40:38.812
"was inhabited by an evil
spirit which influenced her son

40:38.814 --> 40:40.811
"to attack his father with a knife."

40:40.813 --> 40:44.012
Whoa. So it's not just
Walter's bullshit, then.

40:44.014 --> 40:47.310
That doll really does
have a fucked up history.

40:47.312 --> 40:49.676
What if this Jennifer Otto isn't crazy?

40:49.678 --> 40:53.844
What if the doll really is possessed
and all this happened just like she said?

40:55.045 --> 40:57.509
Then I think we need to go and talk to her.

41:02.346 --> 41:03.912
Mrs. Otto?

41:04.578 --> 41:05.976
Hi.

41:08.744 --> 41:10.276
Do I know you?

41:10.278 --> 41:12.007
No.

41:12.009 --> 41:15.008
I'm Emily and this is Kevin.

41:18.075 --> 41:20.008
What's this about?

41:21.142 --> 41:22.808
Robert the Doll.

41:27.809 --> 41:29.642
Do you know where he is?

41:31.008 --> 41:33.105
Yeah.

41:33.107 --> 41:36.073
We work in a museum in
the town of East Falls.

41:36.075 --> 41:37.974
Robert's one of the exhibits there.

41:39.340 --> 41:43.138
Oh no. You need to quit!

41:43.140 --> 41:45.136
We know.

41:45.138 --> 41:48.138
Two of our colleagues have
already died, and we think

41:48.140 --> 41:50.204
maybe the doll has something to do with it.

41:50.206 --> 41:52.571
There's no maybe about it!

41:54.206 --> 41:56.304
The doll's possessed.

41:56.306 --> 41:58.670
Get as far away from it as you can.

41:58.672 --> 42:02.068
The police consider us
suspects for the murders.

42:02.070 --> 42:06.769
We need to prove that the doll
did it, or we could end up in jail.

42:06.771 --> 42:11.134
If I could prove that, my son
wouldn't be in juvenile detention,

42:11.136 --> 42:13.402
and I wouldn't be in this place!

42:14.072 --> 42:16.004
No one believes me!

42:17.204 --> 42:18.535
Maybe you could help us, then.

42:18.537 --> 42:20.800
Is there anything that's not in the media,

42:20.802 --> 42:23.535
that you could tell us about the doll?

42:36.001 --> 42:37.666
Okay.

42:37.668 --> 42:41.131
A couple who once owned the doll

42:41.133 --> 42:44.297
told me that the spirit
inside Robert is a boy

42:44.299 --> 42:45.565
called Robert Crow.

42:45.567 --> 42:49.064
He was murdered by his father.

42:49.066 --> 42:53.163
It was said that the spirit
laid dormant for years and then

42:53.165 --> 42:57.529
Agatha, my former
housekeeper, stirred it up.

42:57.531 --> 43:00.097
When my son was arrested,

43:00.099 --> 43:02.530
I did some digging and I discovered

43:02.532 --> 43:09.163
it wasn't Agatha who encouraged
the evil inside Robert.

43:09.165 --> 43:12.595
I spoke to a psychic, okay, and

43:12.597 --> 43:16.296
she claimed a male energy
connected to Agatha,

43:16.298 --> 43:19.562
he encouraged the evil inside Robert.

43:21.998 --> 43:23.964
Did they say who the man was?

43:25.363 --> 43:29.661
No, but apparently, Agatha has a brother.

43:29.663 --> 43:33.594
Blackwood, Amos... Amos Blackwood!

43:33.596 --> 43:37.625
But he must be operating under a
false identity now though, because

43:37.627 --> 43:41.560
I couldn't find anything in the
public record of him after age 30.

43:41.562 --> 43:44.291
There's no obituary, there's no
details of death, there's nothing.

43:44.293 --> 43:49.125
It's like he just vanished
off the face of the earth.

43:49.127 --> 43:50.725
The psychic thinks he's still alive.

43:50.727 --> 43:53.192
She said he owned a business

43:53.194 --> 43:56.859
and was seeking to profit
from the misfortune of others.

43:58.159 --> 44:00.490
Berenson!

44:00.492 --> 44:04.092
The police said there wasn't any
footage of Robert on the CCTV.

44:04.094 --> 44:06.357
I bet Berenson replaced the tapes!

44:06.359 --> 44:08.057
Who are you talking about?

44:08.059 --> 44:10.122
The museum owner.

44:10.124 --> 44:12.156
You should ask the police
to check his background.

44:12.158 --> 44:13.587
We will.

44:13.589 --> 44:16.090
If he is Amos Blackwood
living under a new name, then

44:16.092 --> 44:17.755
the police should be able to prove it.

44:17.757 --> 44:19.255
Let's do it.

44:19.257 --> 44:21.424
Wait, look, um...

44:24.524 --> 44:27.121
If this turns out to be nothing

44:27.123 --> 44:31.021
and you can't get anyone to believe you,

44:31.023 --> 44:34.288
you just do whatever you
can to destroy that doll...

44:35.055 --> 44:36.587
Before it destroys you.

44:36.589 --> 44:38.021
Like it did me.

44:42.056 --> 44:45.118
That doll has killed several people.

44:45.120 --> 44:47.320
At least you're still alive.

44:51.485 --> 44:53.519
You call this being alive?

44:55.188 --> 44:56.485
I'm sorry, I didn't mean...

44:56.487 --> 44:58.585
You know, that thing

44:58.587 --> 45:03.484
might have left me breathing, but
it took my life in every other way.

45:03.486 --> 45:07.486
Everything I ever loved is gone.

45:09.052 --> 45:11.684
All that's left is four walls.

45:13.518 --> 45:19.316
The only way I can live
now is inside my head.

45:19.318 --> 45:24.282
You know, when you're left alone with your
thoughts you find yourself outnumbered.

45:24.284 --> 45:29.049
You know, I can quieten
my head for like a minute,

45:29.051 --> 45:31.951
but then the past always
comes back to haunt me.

45:33.618 --> 45:36.684
I used to ask myself why?

45:43.348 --> 45:45.248
But I know now.

45:47.447 --> 45:49.012
It's fate.

45:50.981 --> 45:54.713
It's like this concrete thing.

45:58.716 --> 46:04.013
Everyone has to deal
with it sooner or later.

46:05.746 --> 46:09.712
You know, even if you
succeed in killing the doll.

46:09.714 --> 46:12.745
That's the thing you can't kill.

46:14.378 --> 46:16.244
What's that?

46:19.045 --> 46:20.644
Damnation.

46:23.145 --> 46:27.741
It doesn't die like people do.

46:32.344 --> 46:34.776
Fate will never forget you.

46:42.542 --> 46:45.208
So what do you wanna do?

46:45.210 --> 46:48.206
We need to talk to Atkins and
get him to look into Berenson.

46:48.208 --> 46:52.339
So what if Berenson is Agatha's brother
and has some interest in the supernatural?

46:52.341 --> 46:55.540
How does that get us off
the hook as murder suspects?

46:55.542 --> 46:58.537
We need to find a way to connect
the doll and Berenson to the deaths.

46:58.539 --> 47:01.073
Yeah and how the hell are we gonna do that?

47:01.075 --> 47:04.272
Let's arrange a meeting
with Berenson at the museum.

47:04.274 --> 47:06.706
We could tape the conversation
and get Atkins to turn up.

47:06.708 --> 47:09.973
Maybe we could get Berenson to confess
to knowing the doll is dangerous.

47:11.140 --> 47:13.272
But he already advertises that.

47:13.274 --> 47:15.371
Well, what do you suggest we do?

47:15.373 --> 47:18.806
We need to prove that the doll did this
and we've got no video evidence, nothing!

47:20.172 --> 47:21.902
I do have one idea.

47:24.738 --> 47:27.570
Are you sure you want
to go through with this?

47:27.572 --> 47:29.668
Yeah.

47:29.670 --> 47:32.269
I think we owe it to Stan and Ethel.

47:38.705 --> 47:41.733
- Berenson.
- <i>Mr. Berenson, this is Kevin Underwood.</i>

47:41.735 --> 47:42.668
Who?

47:42.670 --> 47:44.635
<i>One of the night security guards.</i>

47:44.637 --> 47:45.732
What do you want?

47:45.734 --> 47:47.800
<i>I made copies of the tapes.</i>

47:50.703 --> 47:52.334
Tapes?

47:54.334 --> 47:55.966
What tapes?

47:56.401 --> 47:58.400
The CCTV tapes.

47:59.701 --> 48:01.668
What are you talking about?

48:03.701 --> 48:05.999
You know what's on those
tapes, don't you, Mr. Berenson?

48:08.267 --> 48:11.264
Well, tell me how you
made copies so quickly,

48:11.266 --> 48:17.196
when those tapes disappeared before
the police even knew to ask for them?

48:17.198 --> 48:20.397
Well, after both murders I
went straight to the CCTV.

48:20.399 --> 48:22.566
Filmed the footage right onto my phone.

48:23.697 --> 48:26.597
Fuck.

48:26.599 --> 48:29.130
How do you think people are going
to react when they find out that

48:29.132 --> 48:33.163
one of your exhibits caused the
death of two innocent people?

48:33.165 --> 48:35.564
I'll tell you how it reflects on me.

48:35.566 --> 48:38.329
I'll make a fucking fortune!

48:38.331 --> 48:40.728
That doll's legend will grow even more.

48:40.730 --> 48:44.395
<i>People will be cramming through
the door, paying any price I ask</i>

48:44.397 --> 48:47.562
<i>just to get a glimpse
of that ugly bastard!</i>

48:47.564 --> 48:49.526
I don't think so, Mr. Berenson.

48:49.528 --> 48:51.494
There's fun for customers
in seeing something spooky,

48:51.496 --> 48:54.426
there's no fun in seeing something
that will fucking kill you.

48:54.428 --> 48:55.993
Customers are going to run to the hills

48:55.995 --> 48:57.661
when they find out how
dangerous that thing is.

48:58.728 --> 49:01.461
What does any of this have to do with me?

49:01.463 --> 49:04.961
I want you to meet me at the museum,

49:04.963 --> 49:06.758
tonight at eight o'clock.

49:06.760 --> 49:09.092
<i>I'll give you the phone
with the footage on it.</i>

49:09.094 --> 49:11.224
<i>And don't worry, I'll
keep your little secret.</i>

49:11.226 --> 49:12.391
Yeah?

49:12.393 --> 49:14.225
And what's in it for you?

49:16.693 --> 49:18.457
A hundred thousand, cash.

49:20.025 --> 49:21.757
So that's what this is about, huh?

49:21.759 --> 49:23.257
Blackmail!

49:23.259 --> 49:25.023
You're a businessman and I'm a businessman.

49:25.025 --> 49:27.491
Just think of it as a business transaction.

49:28.059 --> 49:29.524
Fuck you!

49:29.526 --> 49:32.423
All right, I'll take the
footage to the cops, then.

49:32.425 --> 49:37.023
You think your murderous doll
theory will stand up in court?

49:37.025 --> 49:38.589
Give me a break.

49:38.591 --> 49:40.587
Yeah? Well, what do you
think is going to happen

49:40.589 --> 49:42.689
when police find out that you've
been tampering with evidence

49:42.691 --> 49:44.954
in a double murder investigation?

49:44.956 --> 49:48.487
I mean, whether they believe the
doll theory or not, it doesn't matter.

49:48.489 --> 49:51.289
<i>Tampering with evidence
is a serious offense.</i>

49:51.290 --> 49:53.587
<i>You could get some
quality jail time.</i>

49:53.589 --> 49:57.656
And do you know what those muscle-bound
lifers do to pencil-necks like you in jail?

49:58.755 --> 50:02.986
How do I know you've really
got copies of the tapes?

50:02.988 --> 50:05.321
Can you really afford to take the risk?

50:06.455 --> 50:08.453
And what about that girl?

50:08.455 --> 50:10.987
That cleaner with the glasses?

50:10.988 --> 50:12.954
<i>Does she know anything about this?</i>

50:12.956 --> 50:15.586
I'll split the money with her.

50:15.587 --> 50:18.183
And don't worry. Neither of us will
say anything if we get the cash.

50:18.185 --> 50:20.052
<i>Okay.</i>

50:20.054 --> 50:21.619
I'll play your game.

50:22.251 --> 50:24.685
I'll see you tonight.

50:24.687 --> 50:26.519
Both of you.

50:28.119 --> 50:29.818
Wise choice.

50:38.153 --> 50:39.549
You didn't record the
footage on your phone.

50:39.551 --> 50:41.449
He doesn't know that.

50:41.451 --> 50:43.083
He's admitted that he hid the tapes,

50:43.085 --> 50:45.349
because there's something
incriminating on them.

50:45.351 --> 50:47.746
He's basically given himself away already.

50:47.748 --> 50:50.214
And what about the money?

50:50.216 --> 50:54.381
I needed to show that I had a
motive that didn't involve the cops.

50:54.383 --> 50:56.247
Don't worry, I don't want his money.

50:56.249 --> 50:58.248
This is about clearing our names.

51:03.649 --> 51:05.447
So...

51:05.449 --> 51:07.479
Now, what you're saying is your boss

51:07.481 --> 51:11.646
has hidden the real CCTV footage
taken on the night of the murders?

51:11.648 --> 51:12.978
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

51:12.980 --> 51:14.980
And you're saying

51:14.982 --> 51:18.012
he did that because the real footage proves

51:18.014 --> 51:23.312
that an exhibit from the museum came
to life and perpetrated the murders?

51:26.078 --> 51:27.978
Is this some kind of joke?

51:27.980 --> 51:30.076
We know it sounds crazy,

51:30.078 --> 51:32.377
but when we meet with him tonight
we'll record the conversation

51:32.379 --> 51:34.642
and get him to confess what he's done.

51:34.644 --> 51:36.743
All right, all right.

51:36.745 --> 51:40.010
If he's withheld evidence, well,
it's a serious offense. But this doll?

51:40.012 --> 51:41.443
Come on!

51:41.445 --> 51:43.043
What have you kids been smoking?

51:43.045 --> 51:45.042
That doll has a dark history.

51:45.044 --> 51:46.576
If you haven't heard about it, look it up.

51:46.578 --> 51:48.944
There's articles all over the Internet.

51:48.946 --> 51:51.140
I know all about that.

51:51.142 --> 51:54.943
Some kid killed his
babysitter and his father,

51:54.945 --> 51:56.943
and his mother blamed the doll.

51:58.377 --> 52:01.342
So why don't you believe us?

52:01.344 --> 52:03.709
Because a jury found him guilty of murder,

52:03.711 --> 52:06.041
and because his mother
ended up in an asylum.

52:06.043 --> 52:07.709
Now, I don't know about you,

52:07.711 --> 52:12.074
but that doesn't sound like
a doll was to blame, does it?

52:12.076 --> 52:14.506
Look, you don't have
to believe us right now.

52:14.508 --> 52:16.408
Just come to the museum tonight,

52:16.410 --> 52:19.205
we'll record the confession from
Berenson and the least you can do is

52:19.207 --> 52:22.005
charge him with tampering with
evidence in a murder investigation.

52:22.007 --> 52:26.239
Okay, Johnny Law, you've got
it all worked out, haven't you?

52:26.241 --> 52:31.238
Tell me this. Where does that leave
me with a viable human suspect, eh?

52:31.240 --> 52:34.503
I can't file a report claiming a
doll's responsible for a double murder.

52:34.505 --> 52:36.470
They'll laugh me off the force.

52:36.472 --> 52:38.503
This is an ongoing investigation.

52:38.505 --> 52:40.002
I am gathering evidence.

52:40.004 --> 52:42.602
If you two have done nothing wrong,

52:42.604 --> 52:45.337
you've got nothing to
worry about, have you?

52:45.339 --> 52:50.434
Now what I suggest is you drop
this plan with your boss, go home!

52:50.436 --> 52:53.168
We'll look into your claims
of tampering with evidence.

52:53.170 --> 52:55.737
Just let us get on with our job!

52:57.939 --> 53:00.200
If you've really done nothing wrong,

53:00.202 --> 53:03.602
you can sleep tightly in
your bed tonight, can't you?

53:13.736 --> 53:16.435
Right, phone's set.

53:16.669 --> 53:18.032
You ready?

53:18.034 --> 53:19.300
Yeah.

53:19.302 --> 53:21.599
I just really hope this works.

53:21.601 --> 53:23.000
We'll be fine.

53:23.002 --> 53:25.234
Just stay close, okay?

53:30.266 --> 53:34.032
Ah, young love.

53:34.034 --> 53:35.599
How nice.

53:37.000 --> 53:38.430
You got the money?

53:38.432 --> 53:40.665
You've got the footage?

53:42.465 --> 53:44.531
It's all on here.

53:47.731 --> 53:49.429
Great.

53:51.332 --> 53:53.197
Hand it over.

54:00.996 --> 54:04.362
You hand over the money,
I'll hand over the phone.

54:04.364 --> 54:07.294
Both at the same time, yeah?

54:07.296 --> 54:09.761
Fair enough. I can do that.

54:10.430 --> 54:11.862
Fine.

54:13.328 --> 54:15.358
Before we make this exchange,

54:15.360 --> 54:17.260
there's one thing I gotta know.

54:18.263 --> 54:19.624
Yeah? What?

54:19.626 --> 54:22.426
You knew that doll was
possessed, didn't you?

54:22.428 --> 54:25.958
You put your staff in danger.
You put customers in danger, too.

54:25.960 --> 54:27.460
That doll was an investment.

54:27.462 --> 54:29.992
Nothing more, nothing less.

54:29.994 --> 54:32.060
Of course, after I saw the tapes

54:32.062 --> 54:35.959
and realized that this
haunted doll hype was real...

54:35.961 --> 54:41.925
Well, I just accepted that
as an unexpected bonus.

54:41.927 --> 54:44.258
We know your real name is Amos Blackwood.

54:44.260 --> 54:47.056
You were the one who stirred up
the evil spirit inside that doll.

54:47.058 --> 54:49.189
I don't know what you're talking about.

54:49.191 --> 54:51.456
I was born and bred a Berenson.

54:51.458 --> 54:53.689
You're lying!

54:53.691 --> 54:56.124
That woman who gave the doll to the Otto
family, you're her brother, aren't you?

54:56.126 --> 54:59.223
I think you're mistaken, young lady.

54:59.225 --> 55:00.989
We gonna stand around
and chit chat all night,

55:00.991 --> 55:02.688
or are we gonna get down to business?

55:02.690 --> 55:04.187
Okay.

55:04.189 --> 55:05.756
On three.

55:07.090 --> 55:08.689
Yeah.

55:10.324 --> 55:11.789
One...

55:12.690 --> 55:14.289
Two...

55:15.988 --> 55:17.554
Three.

55:23.320 --> 55:24.619
What the fuck is this?

55:24.621 --> 55:27.288
It's what I think you're worth.

55:27.290 --> 55:29.120
I'm gonna fucking kill you!

55:29.122 --> 55:31.488
I don't think so.

55:36.487 --> 55:41.984
Some young punk thinks he
can take a shot at the title.

55:41.986 --> 55:45.718
You've got the balls, I'll grant you that.

55:45.720 --> 55:49.416
Your problem is you're fighting
way above your weight class.

55:54.285 --> 55:57.315
It's just not even a fair fight.

55:57.317 --> 56:00.117
You couldn't go the distance.

56:00.119 --> 56:01.981
Now...

56:01.983 --> 56:04.950
I think it's time to put
you out of your misery.

56:07.317 --> 56:09.284
Ow, fuck!

56:19.949 --> 56:21.849
We've gotta get out of here!

56:49.546 --> 56:51.612
Oh, shit!

56:52.344 --> 56:53.911
Help!

56:55.413 --> 56:57.379
Oh, fucking hell!

56:58.545 --> 57:00.211
Help!

57:03.578 --> 57:05.141
Come on!

57:05.143 --> 57:06.842
Fucking open!

57:10.111 --> 57:11.576
Shit...

57:12.544 --> 57:15.909
Oh, God. You okay?

57:23.276 --> 57:24.841
Oh, shit.

57:26.909 --> 57:28.907
We need to get out of here.

57:28.909 --> 57:30.774
Come here. Come here.

57:38.377 --> 57:40.174
We need to go.

57:41.374 --> 57:43.604
Where is he?

57:43.606 --> 57:48.704
Come on, come on. Oh,
can you see him? Shit.

57:50.207 --> 57:52.606
Oh, shit. Where is he?

57:55.541 --> 57:57.540
I need to stop.

57:57.706 --> 57:59.237
No, no!

57:59.239 --> 58:01.270
You can't stop, we have to keep going!

58:01.272 --> 58:03.271
Come on, keep going.

58:04.107 --> 58:05.404
No, no, no.

58:07.039 --> 58:09.602
No, no! You can't stop.

58:09.604 --> 58:11.637
No, no, no. Come on.

58:15.205 --> 58:16.704
No.

58:40.635 --> 58:44.531
One, two, three and four,

58:44.533 --> 58:48.566
Robert wants to play and play some more.

58:48.568 --> 58:52.633
Five, six, seven and eight,

58:52.635 --> 58:56.267
forever and ever...

01:00:07.391 --> 01:00:11.191
One, two, three and four,

01:00:11.193 --> 01:00:15.158
Robert wants to play and play some more.

01:00:15.160 --> 01:00:19.056
Five, six, seven and eight,

01:00:19.058 --> 01:00:23.558
forever and ever...

01:03:10.007 --> 01:03:11.672
Where am I?

01:03:12.608 --> 01:03:14.774
East Falls Hospital.

01:03:17.907 --> 01:03:19.372
Kevin...

01:03:20.105 --> 01:03:21.737
Is he dead?

01:03:22.639 --> 01:03:24.237
Yes.

01:03:31.070 --> 01:03:34.503
What do you remember about
events at the museum tonight?

01:03:37.971 --> 01:03:39.536
The doll.

01:03:40.537 --> 01:03:43.102
It's alive, just like I told you.

01:03:44.503 --> 01:03:46.468
Killed everyone.

01:03:46.470 --> 01:03:48.900
Well we found Mr. Berenson.

01:03:48.902 --> 01:03:51.402
And we found Kevin, and we found you.

01:03:51.404 --> 01:03:53.134
Passed out on the corridor.

01:03:53.136 --> 01:03:54.734
How much do you remember?

01:03:57.401 --> 01:04:00.102
We met Berenson, me and Kevin.

01:04:00.600 --> 01:04:02.599
Like we told you.

01:04:04.270 --> 01:04:05.735
The doll went crazy.

01:04:08.302 --> 01:04:11.634
Killed Berenson, killed Kevin.

01:04:14.033 --> 01:04:17.364
Tried to kill me, too, but I fought back.

01:04:17.366 --> 01:04:21.132
So you're saying the doll
committed these murders?

01:04:23.367 --> 01:04:24.966
Yeah.

01:04:24.968 --> 01:04:26.867
Didn't you see it?

01:04:31.632 --> 01:04:33.196
Well, didn't you?

01:04:33.198 --> 01:04:35.930
Well, we checked the
place out when we arrived.

01:04:35.932 --> 01:04:37.465
No doll.

01:04:47.930 --> 01:04:50.129
You're not here to see how I am, are you?

01:04:50.131 --> 01:04:51.796
Not exactly.

01:04:52.630 --> 01:04:54.895
Then why are you here?

01:04:57.395 --> 01:04:59.062
I'm sorry.

01:04:59.064 --> 01:05:02.194
Emily Barker, you have the
right to remain silent, but,

01:05:02.196 --> 01:05:04.225
anything you do say...

01:05:04.227 --> 01:05:08.191
...may and could be used in a court of law.

01:05:08.193 --> 01:05:10.325
You have the right to an attorney...

01:07:13.648 --> 01:07:15.480
Evening, Amos.

01:07:18.014 --> 01:07:20.447
Good evening, Officer Sardy.

01:07:24.347 --> 01:07:25.779
Special delivery.

01:07:26.448 --> 01:07:28.443
Ah.

01:07:28.445 --> 01:07:31.646
This is the one I've been waiting for.

01:07:34.013 --> 01:07:35.544
So, where do you want it, then?

01:07:35.546 --> 01:07:37.410
Uh...

01:07:37.412 --> 01:07:41.478
If you can just put it on the
workbench just around there.

01:07:43.246 --> 01:07:44.812
All right.

01:07:54.476 --> 01:07:59.074
Very, uh, creepy!

01:08:00.544 --> 01:08:02.641
This is the price we agreed.

01:08:02.643 --> 01:08:04.543
Oh, thank you.

01:08:08.343 --> 01:08:10.643
Just remember, old man.

01:08:11.976 --> 01:08:15.639
The shit hits the fan,
you ain't ever heard of me.

01:08:17.942 --> 01:08:21.339
Rest assured, Officer Sardy,

01:08:21.341 --> 01:08:23.904
I know how to keep the secrets.

01:08:23.906 --> 01:08:26.104
Oh, I'm sure you do.

01:08:26.107 --> 01:08:28.807
I mean, what you do with these toys
behind closed doors is your own business.

01:08:29.973 --> 01:08:33.005
However if it does go Pete Tong...

01:08:33.006 --> 01:08:36.139
Well, let's just say it
ain't gonna end well for you.

01:08:38.407 --> 01:08:40.506
Goodnight, Officer Sardy.

01:08:41.471 --> 01:08:43.805
Yeah, goodnight, Toyboy!

01:09:11.938 --> 01:09:13.301
Oh.

01:09:13.938 --> 01:09:15.537
Oh, my boy.

01:09:17.636 --> 01:09:19.769
Look what they've done to you.

01:09:21.902 --> 01:09:23.803
Don't worry, Robert.

01:09:25.136 --> 01:09:27.835
I will get you back on your feet.

01:10:12.531 --> 01:10:16.831
<i>Corpus Levitas, Diablo Dominium,</i>

01:10:17.498 --> 01:10:20.330
<i>Mondo, Licium.</i>

01:11:33.990 --> 01:11:37.290
Let the games begin.
