Okay, Round 2.
Josh, you're up.

00:04.296 --> 00:05.172
What do you got?

00:05.339 --> 00:05.923
Check it out.

00:06.089 --> 00:07.299
Your mama is so stupid,

00:07.466 --> 00:11.220
she thinks an iMac is
a new hamburger at McDonald's.

00:11.386 --> 00:12.221
Okay, not bad.

00:12.387 --> 00:13.931
Okay, okay, I got one. I got one.

00:14.097 --> 00:17.935
What's the difference between
your mama and a washing machine?

00:18.108 --> 00:21.770
When I drop a load in the washing machine
it doesn't follow me around for a week.

00:21.934 --> 00:23.690
Lemon, could I speak
with you alone for a moment?

00:23.854 --> 00:28.365
That's what your sister
asked me last night. Booyah!

00:28.522 --> 00:31.284
Uh, right this way.

00:31.449 --> 00:35.282
Uh, my friend Gerhard Hapsburg
is throwing a birthday party for himself

00:35.455 --> 00:36.490
at the Pierre tonight.

00:36.666 --> 00:39.033
Oh, and you want me to think of something funny
that you can write in the card?

00:39.208 --> 00:41.083
No. I want you to come with me.

00:41.256 --> 00:42.370
Oh.

00:42.548 --> 00:44.711
Who's Gerhard Hapsburg?

00:44.877 --> 00:49.672
Prince Gerhard is the last male descendant
of the Imperial House of Hapsburg.

00:49.848 --> 00:52.053
They ruled the Austro-Hungarian Empire.

00:52.217 --> 00:53.842
The Defenestration of Prague?

00:54.015 --> 00:56.302
Lemon, what exactly did you study in college?

00:56.475 --> 00:57.592
- Theatre Tech.
- I see.

00:57.765 --> 01:01.270
I'm inviting you
to the social event of the season.

01:01.438 --> 01:02.350
Oh...I don't know, Jack.

01:02.526 --> 01:04.480
Would I have to wear high heel shoes?

01:04.646 --> 01:07.190
Yes. This will be good for you.

01:07.356 --> 01:09.063
You finally got Dennis out of your life.

01:09.237 --> 01:10.271
You're even wearing lipstick.

01:10.448 --> 01:11.613
No. They're just really chapped.

01:11.785 --> 01:14.280
I'll have the wardrobe department
pull a dress for you.

01:14.446 --> 01:20.280
I just thought maybe you'd like
to spend some time with a, um...

01:20.456 --> 01:23.251
different class of people.

01:23.415 --> 01:24.910
Okay, fine. I'll do it.

01:25.086 --> 01:26.292
But I'm not gonna like it.

01:26.468 --> 01:28.752
That's what your mom said to me last night.

01:28.925 --> 01:31.343
Booyah.

01:31.507 --> 01:32.253
You got slammed, girl.

01:32.425 --> 01:35.631
That was surprising.

01:52.326 --> 01:54.440
Yes, dear.

01:54.618 --> 01:56.650
Oh, boy, who's crying?

01:56.828 --> 01:57.493
Is that Caleb?

01:57.658 --> 01:58.910
What's up, Pete?

01:59.075 --> 02:01.741
Okay, I'll try. Yeah.

02:01.918 --> 02:05.792
Elmo wants you to aim your pee-pee
at the potty!

02:05.955 --> 02:10.252
Ha ha! No, not at Mommy.
At the potty.

02:10.505 --> 02:12.751
How is that Elmo's fault?

02:12.928 --> 02:16.091
Did Mommy have some wine
before she called Elmo?

02:16.266 --> 02:19.091
Click. Enhhhh!

02:19.438 --> 02:20.930
Pete, Pete, Pete, Pete.

02:21.095 --> 02:23.511
- Where's your spinal cord, son?
- What?

02:23.687 --> 02:27.601
No, it's just my wife is visiting her folks
and she's a little stressed out.

02:27.778 --> 02:29.850
Yeah, seem like
you got yourself a Delilah.

02:30.028 --> 02:31.192
A what?

02:31.367 --> 02:33.190
Pete, you got two type of
women in this world:

02:33.367 --> 02:34.653
one who gives you strength

02:34.826 --> 02:36.152
and one who takes strength from you

02:36.327 --> 02:41.491
like Delilah took strength
from Samson in that movie?

02:41.877 --> 02:44.491
My wife gives me strength,
make me feel like a man.

02:44.667 --> 02:45.953
That's why she's so special.

02:46.128 --> 02:47.621
I actually haven't met
your wife yet. Hi.

02:47.795 --> 02:51.961
That ain't my wife.
Go get me a fizzy water.

02:52.135 --> 02:55.880
It's like this, Pete.
I love my wife. I love her.

02:56.058 --> 02:57.380
We're a team.

02:57.558 --> 03:00.300
That's why eight times a week
I go to the strip club.

03:00.477 --> 03:03.051
It gives me energy,
which I bring back to her.

03:03.225 --> 03:04.182
And your wife doesn't get jealous?

03:04.356 --> 03:06.141
Nah. She likes it.

03:06.318 --> 03:09.521
Makes me feel strong,
like a Samson.

03:09.696 --> 03:10.061
Here.

03:10.236 --> 03:12.521
- Samson!
- What?

03:12.696 --> 03:16.230
Great shoving, Mr. Jordan.

03:19.287 --> 03:20.861
Wow, what's that for?

03:21.038 --> 03:23.702
Well, I'm going to a birthday party
for some prince tonight.

03:23.877 --> 03:25.330
You mean like a dog birthday party?

03:25.497 --> 03:26.622
Oh, that's better.

03:26.797 --> 03:30.503
No. He's a real European prince:
Gerhard Hapsburg.

03:30.668 --> 03:32.501
What? You have to take me with you.

03:32.675 --> 03:35.131
Oh, Liz, it's always been my dream
to meet and marry a prince,

03:35.297 --> 03:36.883
like a modern day Cinderella story.

03:37.058 --> 03:38.923
Hey, maybe I'm Cinderella this time.

03:39.097 --> 03:41.223
No, Liz, Cinderella is blonde.

03:41.387 --> 03:43.841
You can be Snow White
and party with the little people.

03:44.017 --> 03:45.430
Oh, take me.

03:45.605 --> 03:46.313
I can't take you.

03:46.475 --> 03:49.101
I'm only getting in
because Donaghy's taking me.

03:49.275 --> 03:51.353
Wait. You're gonna be
Jack Donaghy's date?

03:51.527 --> 03:53.400
No. It's not a date.

03:53.566 --> 03:56.230
Wow. Lemon.

03:56.906 --> 03:59.650
I, uh, got you a little something.

03:59.828 --> 04:03.862
Oh, my--Ow!
That really hurt my hand.

04:04.036 --> 04:06.121
Dag! Who does that?!

04:06.287 --> 04:07.333
I'm sorry.

04:07.497 --> 04:09.622
Our car will be downstairs at 7:00.

04:09.796 --> 04:11.213
Could you make sure
that she, uh, gets this?

04:11.375 --> 04:13.121
Oh, yes.

04:13.297 --> 04:14.463
Sorry.

04:14.638 --> 04:15.880
This is definitely a date.

04:16.046 --> 04:17.290
No.

04:17.468 --> 04:19.841
Is it?

04:26.147 --> 04:28.062
I didn't know
I was coming to this tonight.

04:28.227 --> 04:29.892
Don't apologize.
You look great.

04:30.067 --> 04:30.722
May I?

04:30.895 --> 04:33.061
Uh, I got it. Thanks.

04:33.236 --> 04:34.060
Careful.

04:34.235 --> 04:36.102
Careful.

04:36.277 --> 04:38.322
Thank you so much.

04:38.487 --> 04:40.651
Let's see, um...

04:40.826 --> 04:42.112
to us.

04:42.285 --> 04:43.321
Is this a date?

04:43.498 --> 04:45.573
What? [chuckles]

04:45.745 --> 04:46.410
Lemon...

04:46.577 --> 04:51.583
I date socialites and models
and actresses-- Liz Hurley in the '90s.

04:51.758 --> 04:52.702
Fine. My mistake.

04:52.877 --> 04:54.501
I think 's so funny
that you thought that.

04:54.677 --> 04:56.671
Hi, Jack. Maybe I'll see you later.

04:56.838 --> 04:58.420
I hope so. Her.

04:58.598 --> 04:59.921
Her.

05:00.095 --> 05:01.880
Her.

05:02.056 --> 05:03.511
The two of them.

05:03.676 --> 05:05.262
This guy coming up on my left--
his daughter this summer.

05:05.437 --> 05:08.683
Wes, good to see you.

05:11.187 --> 05:12.060
Pete Hornberger,

05:12.227 --> 05:14.482
tonight is the night
we celebrate our bodies

05:14.645 --> 05:15.982
and our minds.

05:16.147 --> 05:18.562
Hit it!

05:33.088 --> 05:33.911
Oh, hello.

05:34.087 --> 05:35.660
Hi. How did you get in here?

05:35.838 --> 05:38.212
Oh, Liz, if you dress well
and enter with confidence,

05:38.385 --> 05:39.590
you can get in anywhere.

05:39.755 --> 05:41.382
You showed the security guy your boobs, didn't you?

05:41.555 --> 05:43.551
Just one.
It's not the White House.

05:43.716 --> 05:45.260
Um, Chocatini, please?

05:45.425 --> 05:47.262
You were dead wrong
about this being a date, by the way.

05:47.436 --> 05:49.601
I just made a complete ass out of myself
in front of Jack.

05:49.765 --> 05:51.052
Oh, I'm sorry.

05:51.228 --> 05:53.891
When I'm the Queen of Australia,
I'll have him executed.

05:54.068 --> 05:54.562
Austria.

05:54.737 --> 05:58.232
Yeah, that's what I said.

05:59.615 --> 06:01.231
Ladies und gentlemen,

06:01.405 --> 06:03.651
may I present His Royal Highness,

06:03.907 --> 06:05.650
zeh Duke of Thuringia,

06:05.824 --> 06:08.110
Earl of the Duchy of Westphalia,

06:08.284 --> 06:13.045
Prince Gerhard Messerschmidt
Ramstein Von Hap.

06:19.292 --> 06:20.174
Thank you.

06:20.339 --> 06:25.592
Thank you, all dear friends
for coming to my birthday!

06:28.846 --> 06:32.011
Wow, who's Snow White now?

06:32.188 --> 06:35.722
7:45, and I'm still awake.

06:41.318 --> 06:43.112
- That Gerhard is amazing, isn't he?
- Ah-hum.

06:43.275 --> 06:46.241
Most people in his situation
would be angry with their family

06:46.406 --> 06:48.491
for the centuries of inbreeding,
but not Gerhar.

06:48.657 --> 06:51.452
He's too busy trying
to stave off infection.

06:51.627 --> 06:54.122
Oh, my God.

06:54.286 --> 06:55.623
What is she doing here?

06:55.797 --> 06:56.293
Who?

06:56.458 --> 06:57.543
My ex-wife.

06:57.708 --> 06:59.752
Oh, I forgot, you were married.

06:59.926 --> 07:01.382
Wow, she's gorgeous.

07:01.545 --> 07:03.341
And surprisingly age-appropriate.

07:03.506 --> 07:05.632
Damn it. I was told she was in Paris.

07:05.805 --> 07:08.472
The party of the year, that woman turns up,
and I'm all alone.

07:08.635 --> 07:09.553
Thanks.

07:09.726 --> 07:11.052
Johnny.

07:11.227 --> 07:13.183
Bianca.

07:13.358 --> 07:14.681
Ah, it's been a while.

07:14.857 --> 07:15.681
You look good.

07:15.856 --> 07:16.473
Thank you.

07:16.648 --> 07:18.601
Do you remember
my fiancÃ© Vincent Foley?

07:18.775 --> 07:19.642
Yes, of course.

07:19.816 --> 07:23.362
This is my live-in girlfriend Lemon.

07:23.527 --> 07:24.230
Elizabeth.

07:24.408 --> 07:25.522
Elizabeth.

07:25.696 --> 07:26.192
Hello, Elizabeth.

07:26.367 --> 07:27.152
Lemon.

07:27.325 --> 07:30.320
Nice to meet you.

07:39.585 --> 07:41.081
And how did you two meet?

07:41.257 --> 07:44.253
It was part of the Big Brother/ Little Sister Program.

07:44.426 --> 07:45.501
Congratulations, John.

07:45.677 --> 07:47.591
She's much sharper
than the last girl you had.

07:47.758 --> 07:48.463
What was her name?

07:48.636 --> 07:50.420
BeyoncÃ©.

07:50.597 --> 07:54.550
And unlike the rest of Jack's girlfriends,
I have all my original parts.

07:54.728 --> 07:57.101
Oh, hang on to this one, John.

07:57.266 --> 07:58.223
She's a keeper.

07:58.398 --> 08:01.811
Mmm, yeah. I'm a keeper.

08:02.358 --> 08:03.352
So now it's a date?

08:03.527 --> 08:05.442
I thought I could never be your date, Jack.

08:05.617 --> 08:09.863
I thought no one would ever believe it
because I'm so grotesque.

08:10.038 --> 08:14.070
Thank you for not embarrassing me.

08:14.668 --> 08:17.623
Excuse me, Miss,
but His Highness has noticed you.

08:17.787 --> 08:19.293
Who, Gerhard?

08:19.457 --> 08:20.251
Really?

08:20.417 --> 08:24.420
His Highness is quite taken
und invites you to dine next to him.

08:24.586 --> 08:27.210
Oh, wow. That's...

08:27.387 --> 08:28.342
flattering.

08:28.508 --> 08:32.303
Are you sure
that me meant me?

08:34.188 --> 08:37.182
His Highness is attempting
to wink at you.

08:37.357 --> 08:39.811
Oh. Heh.

08:41.486 --> 08:43.020
There you are.

08:43.196 --> 08:44.102
I need your help.

08:44.275 --> 08:46.520
I've been asked to dine
with His Majesty.

08:46.697 --> 08:49.482
Oh, well, if you're looking
to sneak out the window, it doesn't open.

08:49.656 --> 08:50.482
I already tried it.

08:50.656 --> 08:51.280
Should I say I'm still a virgin?

08:51.447 --> 08:53.031
Wait. You're actually considering this?

08:53.208 --> 08:54.661
Of course I'm considering it.

08:54.828 --> 08:57.532
You know I've always
reminded myself of Grace Kelly.

08:57.707 --> 08:59.872
I'm not gonna be gorgeous forever.

09:00.046 --> 09:03.793
Who knows how long this show will last,
and I have no other skills whatsoever.

09:03.966 --> 09:06.460
I need to find someone
who can take care of me.

09:06.637 --> 09:09.213
Yeah. I don't think Gerhard
can take care of you.

09:09.388 --> 09:10.501
And I can get past someone's looks.

09:10.678 --> 09:11.551
Since when?

09:11.717 --> 09:12.763
I'm an actress, Liz.

09:12.925 --> 09:15.222
It would be my greatest role of all time.

09:15.388 --> 09:16.841
You've already made up
your mind about this, haven't you?

09:17.016 --> 09:19.262
Oh, you're right, Liz,
I should go for it.

09:19.435 --> 09:20.352
You're not even listening, are you?

09:20.518 --> 09:21.472
Poop. Monkey Butt.

09:21.648 --> 09:23.852
No. You're a good friend.

09:24.025 --> 09:26.853
And thank you.

09:29.197 --> 09:30.863
You enjoying yourself, Pete?

09:31.027 --> 09:31.940
Actually--

09:32.117 --> 09:35.071
Actually, Tracy,
I'm trying to get some work done here.

09:35.247 --> 09:37.283
Hey, Supersize,
take care of that dude.

09:37.457 --> 09:38.700
That there's my friend.

09:38.878 --> 09:41.162
Saved my life
when we was in Desert Storm.

09:41.335 --> 09:42.453
Our tank broke down.

09:42.625 --> 09:46.753
He killed 14 Germans
so we could get the hell outta there.

09:46.928 --> 09:52.002
No. No, actually,
I'm just a producer on Tracy's show.

09:52.175 --> 09:53.632
You're a producer?

09:53.807 --> 09:54.423
Yeah.

09:54.598 --> 09:55.633
I'm an actress.

09:55.805 --> 09:57.840
Oh, yeah?
Have you ever seen the movie...

09:58.016 --> 10:00.050
Secret Touchings?

10:00.227 --> 10:01.811
I was a scientist in that.

10:01.975 --> 10:03.853
No, I'm not familiar with that.

10:04.027 --> 10:05.853
Your name sounds Jewish.

10:06.027 --> 10:07.523
You must be important.

10:07.695 --> 10:09.811
No.

10:09.987 --> 10:12.611
Well, I just, you know,
I run the show.

10:12.775 --> 10:15.362
Mr. Hornberger.

10:15.537 --> 10:16.743
This is shocking.

10:16.906 --> 10:18.742
Mind your business, son!

10:18.916 --> 10:20.703
He's embracing his power.

10:20.877 --> 10:22.121
Rawwrr.

10:22.288 --> 10:25.203
Rawwrr. Rawwrr.

10:26.708 --> 10:27.543
Hey, are you gonna come sit down?

10:27.715 --> 10:32.291
Because they put out lobster tails,
and I want to eat yours.

10:32.465 --> 10:35.132
Isn't she beautiful?

10:35.307 --> 10:36.883
Yeah. What happened there?

10:37.055 --> 10:38.722
I just couldn't keep up with her.

10:38.888 --> 10:39.721
On any level.

10:39.897 --> 10:42.853
Socially, it was a different party,
a different charity event every night.

10:43.017 --> 10:44.973
I had to keep my tuxedo
in my glove compartment.

10:45.147 --> 10:46.562
Sexually--

10:46.736 --> 10:48.851
she wanted it four or five times a day.

10:49.028 --> 10:50.601
And always standing up.

10:50.777 --> 10:52.401
Standing up, what?

10:52.568 --> 10:53.901
How does that even work?

10:54.076 --> 10:55.613
You're kidding, right?

10:55.787 --> 10:57.652
Yeah.

10:57.827 --> 11:01.031
She left me, Lemon,
'cause I was never enough for her.

11:01.205 --> 11:05.700
So now I keep it simple:
nothing but endless, meaningless one-night stands

11:05.877 --> 11:09.673
with a carousel of super hot women
I couldn't care less about.

11:09.836 --> 11:11.713
That's heartbreaking.

11:11.887 --> 11:14.291
And her?
She just keeps getting better.

11:14.467 --> 11:16.463
She's lost weight.
She cut her hair.

11:16.637 --> 11:19.303
Look at her over there,
taunting me.

11:19.477 --> 11:21.801
Seeing her so happy
and normal makes me crazy.

11:21.976 --> 11:23.510
You've got to move on, maybe.

11:23.687 --> 11:24.811
Is she coming over here?
She's coming over here.

11:24.977 --> 11:26.101
If she comes over here,
I'm gonna do something.

11:26.276 --> 11:27.641
Okay, come on.
Let's go. Let's go dance.

11:27.815 --> 11:29.233
- Oh, no, no, no. No.
- Yeah, come on.

11:29.396 --> 11:31.141
It's a fast song.

11:31.317 --> 11:32.560
Okay, easy there, Jackie Chan.

11:32.735 --> 11:36.112
- Are they in? They're not out?
- Yeah, be careful.

11:36.287 --> 11:36.691
Oh. Hee hee.

11:36.865 --> 11:38.572
That tickles.

11:38.746 --> 11:40.491
Oh, my dear Jenna...

11:40.657 --> 11:42.413
you are exquisite!

11:42.578 --> 11:44.582
Uh, Gerhard...

11:44.746 --> 11:46.452
would you like to dance?

11:46.627 --> 11:51.962
Sadly, because my body does
not produce joint fluid, I cannot.

11:52.126 --> 11:55.460
But I would enjoy watching
you dance for me.

11:55.636 --> 11:57.922
Oh...

11:58.345 --> 12:00.921
all right.

12:04.187 --> 12:06.472
Jazz!

12:07.436 --> 12:09.681
Tap!

12:10.028 --> 12:11.940
Jitterbug!

12:12.108 --> 12:14.100
Charleston!

12:14.277 --> 12:14.523
Ooh.

12:14.698 --> 12:16.773
Interpretive!

12:16.947 --> 12:18.652
Twirl!

12:18.827 --> 12:20.191
Twirl again!

12:20.367 --> 12:22.652
Keep twirling!

12:22.828 --> 12:25.993
Everyone thinks I'm 5'5",
but I'm only 5'4".

12:26.168 --> 12:29.121
Wow! That is an amazing story.

12:29.295 --> 12:31.293
Yeah.

12:31.468 --> 12:32.540
What are you doing?

12:32.716 --> 12:34.002
You are a married man.

12:34.175 --> 12:35.583
I'm not doing anything wrong.

12:35.758 --> 12:37.712
Just--I'm just dancing, Kenneth.

12:37.888 --> 12:42.301
Do you remember the movie, Footloose,
where those evil kids won in the end?

12:42.476 --> 12:44.182
You're going to make a mistake tonight.

12:44.347 --> 12:46.180
You gonna make a mistake tonight!

12:46.356 --> 12:48.680
Remember the vows you and your wife
took in that church.

12:48.855 --> 12:49.473
Botanical garden.

12:49.645 --> 12:50.891
Botanical garden.

12:51.067 --> 12:52.521
You promised fidelity--

12:52.687 --> 12:53.771
Lick her face.

12:53.946 --> 12:54.851
Think of God.

12:55.025 --> 12:56.732
Look, both of you calm down.

12:56.906 --> 13:01.113
I'm just trying to have some fun
for the first time in, like, ten years.

13:01.285 --> 13:04.663
Ladies und gentlemen,
if you will please direct your attention

13:04.826 --> 13:09.662
to zeh center of zeh room,
it is now time for zeh cake.

13:09.837 --> 13:10.912
(attendees) Aw.

13:11.087 --> 13:12.371
You're 25?

13:12.547 --> 13:15.291
Yes. Can you believe it?

13:15.466 --> 13:18.460
Finally old enough to rent a car.

13:18.636 --> 13:19.922
Ahck!

13:20.098 --> 13:22.380
Ahck!

13:23.016 --> 13:26.183
Oh, it feels good to laugh.

13:26.346 --> 13:27.853
Oh, boy!

13:28.016 --> 13:30.853
* Happy birthd-- * Zum geburstag viel gluck *

13:43.696 --> 13:46.153
Pbbbbbt!

13:48.036 --> 13:49.203
Sie sprechen Deutsch?

13:55.666 --> 13:56.252
Yes. Yay.

13:56.428 --> 13:59.963
Is that Jenna mit Gerhard?

14:03.675 --> 14:05.883
Bianca.

14:06.055 --> 14:06.681
Happy birthday.

14:06.846 --> 14:09.432
Thank you.

14:16.696 --> 14:17.601
Vicky.

14:17.776 --> 14:18.811
No. This is the men's room.

14:18.985 --> 14:21.150
I know. I just wanted to talk to you.

14:21.327 --> 14:22.653
Oh, no, no.
You don't need to do that.

14:22.827 --> 14:24.153
We should get back to the party, right?

14:24.327 --> 14:26.743
I mean, shouldn't we?

14:26.906 --> 14:28.660
- Mr. Hornberger.
- I mean, right?

14:28.828 --> 14:28.953
- The party?
- Mr. Hornberger!

14:29.116 --> 14:31.532
Never done it
in a men's bathroom before.

14:31.707 --> 14:34.413
Well, in this building.

14:34.588 --> 14:36.000
Wow.

14:36.166 --> 14:38.423
You're...

14:38.586 --> 14:40.582
Smooth.

14:40.755 --> 14:43.213
Mr. Hornberger!

14:43.388 --> 14:44.091
Kenneth?

14:44.255 --> 14:45.801
You're making the biggest
mistake of your life.

14:45.966 --> 14:48.432
Don't do it.

14:48.596 --> 14:50.263
Oh, I suppose you're gonna tell me
I should do it.

14:50.436 --> 14:51.853
No. I'm just lookin' for the lobby.

14:52.015 --> 14:53.181
But, yes, you should do it.

14:53.357 --> 14:54.390
(Ken) No, you shouldn't.

14:54.568 --> 14:55.720
Please think of your children.

14:55.896 --> 14:56.933
Be a Samson!

14:57.107 --> 14:58.233
You're a better man than this.

14:58.398 --> 15:01.363
She's so smooth.

15:03.695 --> 15:05.482
I'm sorry.
I can't do this.

15:05.656 --> 15:08.573
I love my wife.

15:08.746 --> 15:11.703
My wife is not a Delilah, Tracy.

15:11.877 --> 15:13.373
Hey, that's beautiful.

15:13.537 --> 15:15.041
I feel you, Hornberger.

15:15.206 --> 15:17.332
Who's that tickling my feet?

15:17.505 --> 15:20.421
I'm gonna kick you in your face,
I know that.

15:20.585 --> 15:22.292
Just water, please.

15:22.467 --> 15:23.883
Are you going to marry him?

15:24.045 --> 15:25.750
Oh, hi. What?

15:25.926 --> 15:27.673
Are you going to marry Jack?

15:27.847 --> 15:31.221
Uh...I don't know.
We've talked about it.

15:31.397 --> 15:34.891
I can tell from the way he looks at you
that he's serious.

15:35.067 --> 15:39.101
That's going to get you pregnant
right away, I'm sure.

15:39.276 --> 15:44.731
A little late-in-life baby
he can parade around Nantucket.

15:46.485 --> 15:48.993
The whole thing makes me want to vomit.

15:49.155 --> 15:49.990
Oh, no. You know what--

15:50.158 --> 15:52.032
I can take the models--

15:52.207 --> 15:54.122
the Rockettes to Shakira--

15:54.286 --> 15:57.372
because ultimately
I know they are going to leave him,

15:57.547 --> 15:59.160
but you?

15:59.337 --> 16:03.252
You can actually make him happy.

16:03.507 --> 16:06.840
And that makes me want to sit on a knife!

16:07.007 --> 16:07.920
Wow.

16:08.095 --> 16:11.722
I hate seeing Johnny happy!

16:12.515 --> 16:14.801
Uh...

16:16.356 --> 16:16.681
Oh, boy.

16:16.858 --> 16:17.563
Oh, Jenna,

16:17.728 --> 16:21.233
this is almost like something
out of a fairy tale.

16:21.395 --> 16:23.152
[chuckles] Yes.

16:23.315 --> 16:25.731
Almost.

16:30.287 --> 16:32.033
Great news. Great news.

16:32.206 --> 16:35.201
Bianca is neither normal nor happy.

16:35.378 --> 16:36.452
You don't have to do this, Lemon.

16:36.628 --> 16:38.492
I'm telling you,
she's not over you.

16:38.667 --> 16:41.121
And get this:
she was all jealous of me.

16:41.297 --> 16:43.082
She busted out crying over it.

16:43.258 --> 16:44.292
That's impossible.

16:44.466 --> 16:45.383
Oh...fine.

16:45.546 --> 16:46.543
You don't believe me?

16:46.716 --> 16:47.672
I'm gonna go over there,

16:47.845 --> 16:50.673
I'm gonna tell her that
you just proposed to me,

16:50.846 --> 16:51.671
and you watch her.

16:51.846 --> 16:55.890
Watch how red her face gets, okay?

16:58.185 --> 17:01.523
Bianca, I have to tell you,
Jack and I are engaged.

17:01.686 --> 17:02.681
Ah!

17:02.855 --> 17:04.351
Aah!

17:04.525 --> 17:06.521
Let go. Aah!

17:06.695 --> 17:08.941
You!

17:13.576 --> 17:16.570
What do you know?

17:21.915 --> 17:23.042
Jenna...

17:23.214 --> 17:28.093
I know we have just met,
but I think I love you.

17:28.298 --> 17:29.961
Do you love me?

17:30.137 --> 17:31.510
[muffled] Mm-hmm.

17:31.676 --> 17:32.382
Oh!

17:32.555 --> 17:38.222
Knowing I have the love of a beautiful woman
has set me free.

17:41.776 --> 17:45.731
I think you just lost an eyebrow.

17:46.028 --> 17:48.230
To freedom.

17:48.405 --> 17:50.770
To us.

17:57.207 --> 17:59.162
Thank you, dear Jenna.

17:59.327 --> 18:02.120
And good-bye.

18:02.835 --> 18:03.952
Good-bye?

18:04.127 --> 18:05.413
W-why good-bye?

18:05.588 --> 18:07.462
Who let him drink champagne?

18:07.628 --> 18:09.963
He cannot metabolize zeh grapes.

18:10.138 --> 18:12.132
Someone call Dr. Spuchemen!

18:12.308 --> 18:13.340
Uh-oh.

18:13.517 --> 18:15.593
I think she pulled out
a chunk of my hair.

18:15.768 --> 18:16.800
Really? Where?

18:16.977 --> 18:19.261
Oh, yeah.

18:19.436 --> 18:22.603
We gotta boogie, gang.

18:22.765 --> 18:25.100
Meine damen und herren,

18:25.277 --> 18:27.601
zeh Hapsburg line...

18:27.775 --> 18:29.980
has ended.

18:30.155 --> 18:35.073
You can pick up your gift bags
at zeh coat check.

18:44.546 --> 18:48.542
Hey, Pete, really inspiring
what you did back there.

18:48.717 --> 18:50.003
You're strong now.

18:50.178 --> 18:52.172
When your wife get home,
you gonna mess it up?

18:52.345 --> 18:54.173
Actually, I think I might.

18:54.347 --> 18:56.881
Let's go.

19:02.555 --> 19:03.600
You goin' down, Pete?

19:03.765 --> 19:07.391
Uh... I'll take the stairs.

19:07.566 --> 19:10.900
Hold the door, please.

19:11.315 --> 19:14.863
Mmm! You look like a baby.

19:16.446 --> 19:18.153
Well, thanks for a fun evening.

19:18.328 --> 19:20.412
Sorry your friend died.

19:20.575 --> 19:23.203
When Gerhard was born,
the doctor told his mother and cousin

19:23.376 --> 19:24.913
he would either live for 15 minutes

19:25.086 --> 19:27.041
or for 100 years.

19:27.206 --> 19:31.001
Boy, he proved them all wrong.

19:31.887 --> 19:33.542
No, please, come in.

19:33.718 --> 19:36.460
The look on Bianca's face
just before she choked you.

19:36.636 --> 19:39.472
- That was the most satisfying thing.
- It was pretty good.

19:39.636 --> 19:43.262
Oh, just to know that she's filled
with bile over me warms my heart.

19:43.436 --> 19:45.510
Attaboy. That's the Jack Donaghy I know.

19:45.688 --> 19:47.430
What are these, your bike shorts?

19:47.605 --> 19:49.311
All right, knock it off.

19:49.485 --> 19:51.062
Lemon, I want to thank you

19:51.235 --> 19:52.690
for showing me that
I can have a pleasant evening

19:52.868 --> 19:54.273
with a woman my own age.

19:54.445 --> 19:56.072
I'm 12 years younger than you.

19:56.237 --> 19:59.611
A woman your age, then.

20:04.326 --> 20:06.993
Jack, wait.

20:07.917 --> 20:09.580
Oh, my God. I thought you were--

20:09.756 --> 20:11.620
Oh, good lord, Lemon, let it go.

20:11.796 --> 20:12.791
That's never going to happen.

20:12.965 --> 20:13.880
I've been with beauty queens--

20:14.047 --> 20:14.790
Yes, I get it.

20:14.966 --> 20:16.093
Pilates instructors, acrobats.

20:16.258 --> 20:21.551
- Get outta here so I can take my shoes off.
- Come on.

20:21.807 --> 20:26.101
I had "lunch" with Martha Stewart
and "dinner" with her daughter Alexis.

20:26.267 --> 20:28.641
Gross.
