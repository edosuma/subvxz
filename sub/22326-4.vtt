12:22.500 --> 12:23.620
Saw, no!

12:23.620 --> 12:25.460
(GROANS)

12:26.750 --> 12:29.540
I've come too far
to give up the quest.

12:29.540 --> 12:32.000
I must learn the secrets
of my enemy.

12:32.000 --> 12:34.540
And today, I will.

12:41.620 --> 12:43.620
(ENERGY CRACKLES, EXPLODES)

12:50.580 --> 12:53.420
I've retaken
hold six, Captain.
The cargo is gone.

12:53.420 --> 12:56.620
Gone? Commander,
if anything happens
to that crystal...

12:56.620 --> 12:58.040
It's both our heads.

12:58.040 --> 12:59.290
Where are the rebels?

12:59.290 --> 13:00.710
(SCOFFING)
I don't know.

13:00.710 --> 13:02.420
But we've lost contact
with the engine room.

13:08.460 --> 13:10.290
SAW: We're going
to the Tonnis sector.

13:10.290 --> 13:13.290
Dock at the hatch
near the starboard engines.
I'll meet you.

13:13.290 --> 13:15.580
(GROANING) Ezra...
Wake up.

13:15.580 --> 13:17.960
Your friend turned on us.

13:17.960 --> 13:19.670
Saw, you shot me!

13:19.670 --> 13:21.920
Let's be more precise.
I stunned you.

13:21.920 --> 13:23.330
You betrayed us!

13:23.330 --> 13:25.000
Geonosis was only
the beginning.

13:25.000 --> 13:28.040
The materials,
the power technician,
the crystal,

13:28.040 --> 13:30.420
it all adds up to what
the Empire's building.

13:30.420 --> 13:32.420
We have to ride
this ship to the end,

13:32.420 --> 13:35.080
to those empty coordinates
in the Tonnis sector.

13:35.080 --> 13:39.670
I know that's where we'll find
this... This super weapon!

13:39.670 --> 13:42.080
There's no guarantee
anything will be there...

13:42.080 --> 13:44.880
If it even exists.
But I guarantee you

13:44.880 --> 13:46.830
the Empire will have
reinforcements waiting.

13:46.830 --> 13:48.880
I thought we were
on the same side.

13:48.880 --> 13:52.000
The difference between us,
Ezra, is this.

13:52.000 --> 13:56.750
I will do whatever
is required to be the victor.

13:56.750 --> 13:58.960
Why did you bring
the crystal in here, Saw?

13:58.960 --> 14:00.500
It's like you said.

14:00.500 --> 14:02.120
We can't allow it
to remain
in the Empire's hands.

14:02.120 --> 14:04.540
(ALARM BLARING)
Coming out of hyperspace.

14:06.620 --> 14:08.500
This is it. We're here.

14:08.500 --> 14:09.710
I hope this was worth it.

14:24.580 --> 14:26.670
It's only a Star Destroyer.

14:26.670 --> 14:29.040
The Empire's big secret
isn't here.

14:29.040 --> 14:31.380
It has to be here.
It has to be.

14:36.330 --> 14:37.790
The freighter captain confirms

14:37.790 --> 14:39.960
they have rebels
trapped on board.

14:39.960 --> 14:42.120
Prepare a boarding party.

14:42.120 --> 14:44.330
Sir! Rebel vessel approaching.

14:55.540 --> 14:57.120
Cease fire!

14:57.120 --> 14:58.960
We can't risk hitting
the freighter
with the crystal on board.

15:01.960 --> 15:04.210
My ride's here.
Are you coming?

15:04.210 --> 15:05.830
And leave the prisoners?

15:05.830 --> 15:07.670
This is war, Ezra.

15:07.670 --> 15:09.380
What about doing
what's right?

15:09.380 --> 15:10.830
Isn't that what
this war is about?

15:10.830 --> 15:12.120
What is right?

15:12.120 --> 15:13.500
Let me ask you this.

15:13.500 --> 15:14.790
What would you do

15:14.790 --> 15:16.540
to save your world?

15:17.790 --> 15:19.000
It's too late for me.

15:19.000 --> 15:20.500
My world is gone.

15:20.500 --> 15:22.080
I lost everything.

15:22.080 --> 15:24.710
And once you do,
you can see things clearly,

15:24.710 --> 15:27.580
and you understand
what's at stake.

15:27.580 --> 15:29.830
But we do still
have something, Saw.

15:29.830 --> 15:31.670
The people on this ship.

15:31.670 --> 15:33.250
I just want to help them.

15:33.250 --> 15:35.040
They need us!

15:35.040 --> 15:36.460
That's your choice, Ezra.

15:36.460 --> 15:37.710
But I suggest you hurry.

15:37.710 --> 15:39.920
Because this is what
I am willing to do.

15:39.920 --> 15:41.000
What are you doing?

15:42.880 --> 15:44.960
You said these crystals
can become unstable.

15:47.250 --> 15:49.380
(ENERGY CRACKLING
AND SIZZLING)

15:57.540 --> 15:59.120
You're turning it
into a bomb?

15:59.120 --> 16:01.830
I won't let the Empire
use it, so you better
get off this ship.

16:03.040 --> 16:04.170
Hands up.

16:05.330 --> 16:07.040
(GROANS)

16:07.040 --> 16:08.710
Saw! Let us outta here!

16:11.620 --> 16:13.830
Last chance, Ezra.

16:13.830 --> 16:16.210
You fight your war.
We'll fight ours.

16:16.210 --> 16:17.750
Farewell, friend.

16:17.750 --> 16:19.000
I hope we meet again.

16:24.040 --> 16:25.710
Abandon ship immediately!

16:28.920 --> 16:30.580
Can you stop this?
No!

16:30.580 --> 16:33.120
It'll just keep absorbing
power until it discharges.

16:35.670 --> 16:39.000
And trust me, we don't want
to be anywhere close
when that happens,

16:39.000 --> 16:40.670
which won't be long.

16:40.670 --> 16:41.750
Then we better hurry!

is leaving,

16:57.540 --> 17:00.710
but scans indicate
the crystal is
not on board.

17:00.710 --> 17:02.330
Then it's still
on the transport.

17:02.330 --> 17:03.580
Move us in closer.

17:03.580 --> 17:04.920
We need to secure it.

we're in the Tonnis sector.

to that shuttle.

and awaiting your arrival.

to the container now.

was ordered
to evacuate us.

to enlist in your cause.

We've figured
if the Empire
valued our skills,

they'd be better put to work
serving you and the Rebellion.

will be grateful

we prevented the Empire

21:04.540 --> 21:05.790
from getting
their hands on.

that they're trying

21:07.080 --> 21:08.380
to weaponize it somehow.

Is that even possible?

has already begun?
