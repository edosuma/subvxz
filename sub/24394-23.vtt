NARRATOR 1: Ever feel like
you're screaming into the void

00:05.700 --> 00:06.667
and no one is listening?

00:06.734 --> 00:08.066
NARRATOR 2:
Yes! All the time.

00:08.133 --> 00:09.433
NARRATOR 1: Well,

It's the most important election
of our lifetime.

00:13.166 --> 00:15.100
NARRATOR 1: And yes,
people say that every year.

And offer some light criticism

00:28.300 --> 00:29.967
of a few politicians with whom
we differ.

00:30.700 --> 00:32.400
It's a political conversation
for anyone who's not ready

00:32.467 --> 00:34.166
-to give up.

and you want to throw your phone
out the window.

00:37.800 --> 00:40.166
NARRATOR 2: But you never
go through with it. Coward.

00:40.567 --> 00:41.734
NARRATOR 1:
Because despite all the noise...

00:41.967 --> 00:44.033
NARRATOR 2: ...and the lies,
and the cynicism...

00:44.400 --> 00:46.500
NARRATOR 1: ...ordinary people
are pushing back.

00:47.300 --> 00:48.367
So much is at stake.

00:48.600 --> 00:50.266
If this isn't who we are...

NARRATOR 2:

>> CAN YOU TELL US ABOUT A

01:31.200 --> 01:32.133
SEXUAL ENCOUNTER WHERE CONSENT

01:32.200 --> 01:33.533
WAS AN ISSUE?

01:33.600 --> 01:34.967
>> YEAH, UM, I THINK OVER THE

01:35.033 --> 01:36.867
COURSE OF MY LIFE, AS WITH A LOT

01:36.934 --> 01:37.667
OF MY FRIENDS, AND I'M SURE A

01:37.700 --> 01:38.800
LOT OF WOMEN, THERE HAVE BEEN

01:38.867 --> 01:40.967
MANY.

01:41.033 --> 01:42.867
>> IT WAS MY FRESHMAN YEAR.

01:42.934 --> 01:44.567
IT WAS AROUND THE FALL SO I HAD

01:44.633 --> 01:45.734
JUST GOT SETTLED INTO MY DORM

01:45.800 --> 01:48.900
ROOM.

01:48.967 --> 01:50.967
>> I WAS VERY DRUNK AND I ASKED

01:51.033 --> 01:53.767
A FRIEND FOR A RIDE HOME.

01:53.834 --> 01:57.000
>> I LIKED THIS PERSON, THIS

01:57.066 --> 01:59.533
PERSON LIKED ME, AND, YOU KNOW,

01:59.600 --> 02:02.367
YOU BEGIN TO MAKE OUT.

02:02.433 --> 02:04.633
>> HE STARTED KISSING ME, AND I

02:04.700 --> 02:06.166
DIDN'T WANT -- I WAS LIKE, OKAY,

02:06.233 --> 02:08.967
THAT'S ALL RIGHT.

02:09.033 --> 02:10.533
>> AND THEN ALL OF A SUDDEN, IT

02:10.600 --> 02:11.800
BECOMES -- IT'S AN ENERGY SHIFT.

02:11.867 --> 02:13.300
>> BUT THEN HE STARTED TO

02:13.367 --> 02:14.867
UNDRESS ME AND --

02:14.934 --> 02:18.200
>> HE HAD HIS HAND ON MY HEAD,

02:18.266 --> 02:20.233
AND HE KIND OF, LIKE, PUSHED IT.

02:20.300 --> 02:21.233
>> AND IT BECOMES LESS ABOUT YOU

02:21.300 --> 02:22.867
AS A PERSON AND MORE OF YOU AS A

02:22.934 --> 02:25.600
THING.

02:25.667 --> 02:27.233
>> HE, LIKE, JUST SORT OF LIKE

02:27.300 --> 02:28.800
PUT HIMSELF INSIDE ME WITHOUT ME

02:28.867 --> 02:32.200
SAYING ANYTHING, AND THEN WHEN I

02:32.266 --> 02:34.333
STARTED SAYING "NO," HE SORT OF

02:34.400 --> 02:35.233
WAS LIKE, "SHH."

02:35.300 --> 02:38.100
>> IN MY HEAD I WAS LIKE "NO,

02:38.166 --> 02:38.967
NO, NO, NO, NO," BUT...

02:39.033 --> 02:40.066
>> YOU KNOW, "NO" WAS NEVER

02:40.133 --> 02:41.700
REALLY A FACTOR IN WHETHER OR

02:41.767 --> 02:42.700
NOT IT WAS GOING TO HAPPEN.

02:42.767 --> 02:44.900
>> I FELT LIKE IF I KEPT TRYING

02:44.967 --> 02:47.233
THAT SOMETHING WORSE WOULD

02:47.300 --> 02:49.200
HAPPEN SO I EVENTUALLY I JUST

02:49.266 --> 02:52.633
KIND OF LET IT HAPPEN.

02:52.700 --> 02:54.033
>> EVERY SINGLE WOMAN I KNOW HAS

02:54.100 --> 02:55.800
STORIES LIKE THAT, WHERE SHE

02:55.867 --> 02:58.734
JUST LET HER BODY BE USED

02:58.800 --> 03:00.467
BECAUSE IT'S JUST EASIER OR IT

03:00.533 --> 03:01.300
FELT SAFER.

03:01.367 --> 03:07.133
♪ ♪

03:07.200 --> 03:10.734
>> I REMEMBER WHEN I WAS ABOUT

03:10.800 --> 03:13.500
18 AND THERE WAS THIS GUY WHO

03:13.567 --> 03:14.533
WAS A FRIEND OF MINE WHO I JUST

03:14.600 --> 03:15.133
THOUGHT WAS THE MOST BEAUTIFUL

03:15.200 --> 03:17.166
PERSON IN THE WORLD.

03:17.233 --> 03:17.934
AND WE HAD GONE OUT ONE NIGHT.

03:17.967 --> 03:21.133
WE'D BEEN DRINKING A LOT.

03:21.200 --> 03:25.500
AND IT WASN'T UNTIL I KIND OF

03:25.600 --> 03:31.233
TURNED AROUND AND SAW HIM NAKED

03:31.300 --> 03:32.500
AND HE STARTED TAKING MY

03:32.567 --> 03:34.200
CLOTHES OFF AND PUSHING MY HEAD

03:34.266 --> 03:35.600
DOWN THAT, UM, I REALIZED THAT I

03:35.667 --> 03:37.433
REALLY -- NOT A TINY PART OF ME

03:37.500 --> 03:40.934
WANTED TO DO THAT.

03:41.000 --> 03:42.367
I REMEMBER SAYING TO HIM, I

03:42.433 --> 03:45.433
DON'T REALLY WANT TO HAVE SEX.

03:45.500 --> 03:46.800
AND I ALSO REMEMBER HIM KIND OF

03:46.867 --> 03:50.133
TAKING THAT AS A CUE TO CONVINCE

03:50.200 --> 03:52.700
ME.

03:52.767 --> 03:54.667
IT'S ONLY REALLY NOW THAT THIS

03:54.734 --> 03:56.467
MOMENT OF CULTURAL RECKONING HAS

03:56.533 --> 03:59.200
COME ABOUT THAT I THINK SO MANY

03:59.266 --> 04:02.133
OF US ARE THINKING ABOUT OUR OWN

04:02.166 --> 04:02.700
EXPERIENCES AND OUR OWN SEXUAL

04:02.767 --> 04:05.633
ENCOUNTERS, AND IT'S THOSE KIND

04:05.700 --> 04:06.834
OF CONVERSATIONS, MOST OF WHICH

04:06.900 --> 04:09.934
HAVE BEEN TAKING PLACE BEHIND

04:10.000 --> 04:13.467
CLOSED DOORS BETWEEN MYSELF, MY

04:13.533 --> 04:16.700
FRIENDS, THAT I THOUGHT, YOU

04:16.767 --> 04:18.767
KNOW, IT'S A GOOD TIME TO

04:18.834 --> 04:21.633
EXPLORE WHAT CONSENT REALLY

04:21.700 --> 04:22.433
MEANS, WHICH IS THE REASON I

04:22.500 --> 04:23.266
WANTED TO MAKE THIS

04:23.333 --> 04:24.500
DOCUMENTARY.

04:24.567 --> 04:25.333
>> HELLO.

04:25.400 --> 04:26.467
>> AREN'T YOU IN THE WRONG ROOM,

04:26.533 --> 04:26.967
MR. BOND?

04:28.867 --> 04:33.700
LOVE AND ROMANCE THROUGH MOVIE

04:33.767 --> 04:35.367
LIKE "JAMES BOND,"

04:35.433 --> 04:37.166
WHERE THE HEROES SPEND THEIR

04:37.233 --> 04:38.633
TIME IN THE RELENTLESS PURSUIT

04:38.700 --> 04:39.467
OF WOMEN, WHICH IS SEEN AS A

04:39.533 --> 04:41.033
SEXY IDEAL.

04:41.100 --> 04:42.300
BUT OFF-SCREEN, HOLLYWOOD ITSELF

04:42.367 --> 04:46.633
HAS BEEN CHANGING.

04:56.133 --> 04:56.800
THE HARVEY WEINSTEIN SCANDAL

04:56.867 --> 04:57.934
UNLEASHED A FLOOD OF ALLEGATIONS

04:57.967 --> 04:58.667
THAT BECAME KNOWN AS THE #MeToo

04:58.734 --> 04:59.066

INCLUDING VICE.

05:05.900 --> 05:07.734
IN THIS MOMENT OF EXTRAORDINARY

05:07.800 --> 05:09.500
RECKONING, THESE PERSONAL

05:09.567 --> 05:11.066
ENCOUNTERS COULD HAVE ENORMOUS

05:11.133 --> 05:16.033
POLITICAL CONSEQUENCES.

>> MAJOR BREAKING

05:25.033 --> 05:25.600
AND KAVANAUGH WERE BOTH IN HIGH

05:25.667 --> 05:30.834
SCHOOL.

05:30.900 --> 05:41.667
>> WE BELIEVE!

05:41.734 --> 05:46.300

05:46.367 --> 05:50.000
MORE NUANCED THING.

JESSICA BENNETT,

05:50.700 --> 05:51.800
GENDER EDITOR AT THE NYT,

05:51.867 --> 05:52.400
EXPLAINED WHY THIS STORY STOOD

05:52.467 --> 05:54.367
OUT FROM THE REST.

05:54.433 --> 05:55.734
>> WHAT WERE YOUR THOUGHTS

05:55.800 --> 05:56.667
WHEN THE AZIZ ANSARI EXPOSE CAME

05:56.734 --> 05:57.767
OUT?

05:57.834 --> 05:58.433
>> I'VE BEEN IN THIS

05:58.500 --> 06:01.433
SITUATION.

06:01.500 --> 06:02.233
AND MOST PEOPLE I KNOW HAVE

06:02.300 --> 06:02.400
TOO.

06:02.467 --> 06:03.767
YOU KNOW, JOURNALISTICALLY, I

06:03.834 --> 06:04.333
THOUGHT THERE WERE A LOT OF

06:04.400 --> 06:04.967
PROBLEMS WITH HOW THE REPORTING

06:05.033 --> 06:05.900
WAS DONE, HOW IT WAS DELIVERED,

06:05.967 --> 06:07.066
BUT THAT CASE OPENED UP A REALLY

06:07.133 --> 06:11.066
IMPORTANT CONVERSATION THAT

06:11.133 --> 06:16.333
NEEDED TO HAPPEN ALONGSIDE

06:16.400 --> 06:17.100
OR WITHIN #MeToo AT LARGE, WHICH

06:17.166 --> 06:18.533
IS THAT THERE ARE THESE SORT OF

06:18.600 --> 06:19.667
MURKIER GREY AREA SITUATIONS.

06:19.734 --> 06:20.300
>> TO BE HONEST, I THINK THAT A

06:20.367 --> 06:21.100
LOT OF US, MYSELF INCLUDED,

06:21.166 --> 06:23.867
HADN'T REALLY THOUGHT ABOUT IT

06:23.934 --> 06:24.867
UNTIL THE ASIZ ANSARI THING CAME

06:24.900 --> 06:25.633
OUT.

06:25.700 --> 06:27.133
AND THEN IT WAS LIKE, "OH, WAS

06:27.200 --> 06:28.133
THAT SITUATION?"

06:28.200 --> 06:29.467
>> YEAH.

06:29.533 --> 06:30.967
I MEAN, I THINK A LOT OF US, ALL

06:31.033 --> 06:34.100
GENDERS, ARE LOOKING BACK ON

06:34.166 --> 06:35.734
PAST EXPERIENCES WITH A NEW

06:35.800 --> 06:36.700
LENS NOW.

06:36.767 --> 06:38.533
AND YOU CAN'T REALLY PUT THIS

06:38.600 --> 06:39.600
BACK TO THE WAY IT WAS.

06:39.667 --> 06:41.867
LIKE, HARVEY WEINSTEIN BEGAN

06:41.934 --> 06:44.100
THIS CONVERSATION, BUT IT'S NOT

06:44.166 --> 06:50.133
A NEW CONVERSATION.

06:50.200 --> 06:50.834
>> THE #MeToo

06:50.900 --> 06:52.100

07:30.367 --> 07:30.667
OUR DAILY LIVES.

07:30.734 --> 07:34.800
NOW I'VE GOTTEN THE NERDY SHIT

07:34.867 --> 07:35.166
OUT OF THE WAY.

07:35.233 --> 07:37.333
LET'S TALK ABOUT PUSSY.

07:37.400 --> 07:38.266

07:45.200 --> 07:50.367
WAS THE SPECIAL GUEST.

07:50.433 --> 07:51.333
>> SO, WHAT WE'RE

07:51.400 --> 07:52.367
GONNA DO IS, I'M GONNA READ SOME

07:59.667 --> 08:00.300
"IT'S A GO," "I DON'T KNOW,"

08:00.367 --> 08:01.266
"IT'S A NO."

08:01.333 --> 08:02.400
BECAUSE OFTENTIMES, THE GREY

08:02.467 --> 08:02.967

08:08.633 --> 08:09.467
CONVERSATION AND DECIDED TO HAVE

08:09.533 --> 08:14.133
SEX WITH HIM THAT NIGHT.

08:14.200 --> 08:17.066
IN THE MORNING, TAQUANDA WOKE UP

08:28.533 --> 08:34.467
IS THAT CONSENSUAL OR NOT?

08:34.533 --> 08:36.900
>> I'MA BE HONEST, I'M NOT

08:50.500 --> 08:52.700
THAT'S A DOUBLE STANDARD.

08:52.767 --> 08:54.133
>> SO, I SAID -- I SAID

08:54.200 --> 08:57.333
THIS IS A BAD, AND IF I ALREADY

08:57.400 --> 09:00.500
SUCKED YOUR DICK I'M GONE SUCK

09:00.567 --> 09:06.934
IT -- WITHIN 24 HOURS?

09:06.967 --> 09:07.834
>> LOOK, I SEE A MAN

09:07.900 --> 09:08.433
IN THE AUDIENCE, LIKE THUMBS,

09:08.500 --> 09:10.967
NOT CONSENSUAL, NOT CONSENSUAL.

09:11.066 --> 09:11.967
>> IT'S NOT, IT'S NOT

09:12.033 --> 09:12.500
CONSENSUAL.

09:12.567 --> 09:13.433
AND THAT'S THE DOUBLE STANDARD

09:13.500 --> 09:14.567
WHEN IT COMES TO MEN AND WOMEN.

09:14.633 --> 09:15.333
>> OH!

09:15.400 --> 09:17.033
SPEAK ON.

09:17.100 --> 09:18.600
>> THE THING IS THAT -- WHEN

09:18.667 --> 09:19.900
YOU'RE A MAN, IT'S ASSUMED THAT

09:19.967 --> 09:21.667
YOU'RE THE AGGRESSOR AND THAT

09:21.734 --> 09:24.467
YOU TAKE, YOU TAKE INITIATIVE.

09:24.533 --> 09:25.967
BUT WHEN YOU'RE THE WOMAN,

09:26.033 --> 09:26.567
YOU'RE THE SUBMISSIVE.

09:26.633 --> 09:27.633
SO NOW WHAT HAPPENS IS THAT WHEN

09:27.700 --> 09:28.266
WOMEN TAKE A DOMINANT POSITION,

09:28.333 --> 09:28.900
BECAUSE THEY'RE WOMEN AND WE'RE

09:28.967 --> 09:29.500
MEN, WE'RE SUPPOSED TO ACCEPT

09:29.567 --> 09:29.800
IT.

09:29.867 --> 09:30.433
BUT, IF I DON'T GET A YES, IT'S

09:30.500 --> 09:31.333
A NO, RIGHT?

09:31.400 --> 09:32.367
SO IF YOU DON'T GET A YES, IT'S

09:32.433 --> 09:33.166
A NO.

09:33.233 --> 09:34.533
>> IF YOU WANT TO WAKE UP AND

09:34.600 --> 09:36.867
SUCK MY DICK AND YOU DON'T GET A

09:36.934 --> 09:37.233
YES, IT'S A NO!

09:37.300 --> 09:38.533
SO, NO!

09:38.600 --> 09:40.900
>> NAH.

09:40.967 --> 09:42.266
>> THE THING IS THOUGH IS THAT

09:42.333 --> 09:44.333
THE DISCUSSION HAS TO BE HAD

09:44.400 --> 09:45.233
BETWEEN THE TWO PEOPLE ABOUT

09:45.300 --> 09:45.800
WHAT CAN AND CAN'T GO DOWN.

09:45.867 --> 09:48.133
>> THANK YOU.

09:48.200 --> 09:49.700
>> BUT LET ME BE REAL,

09:49.767 --> 09:50.734
THESE THREE PLUS ME, WE'RE

09:50.800 --> 09:52.600
NASTY.

09:52.667 --> 09:53.667
YOU SEEM VERY MIDDLE OF THE

09:53.734 --> 09:53.967
ROAD.

09:54.033 --> 09:55.767
>> I'M PRETTY VANILLA.

09:55.867 --> 09:57.033
>> PROBABLY VANILLA.

09:57.100 --> 09:59.033
DO YOU HAVE CONVERSATIONS WITH

09:59.133 --> 10:01.200
YOUR PARTNER PRIOR TO ACTUAL

10:01.266 --> 10:02.333
INTERCOURSE?

10:02.400 --> 10:03.000
>> NO.

10:03.066 --> 10:05.133
VERY RARELY.

10:05.200 --> 10:09.200
>> SEE, SHE'S COOL.

10:09.266 --> 10:09.467
[LAUGHTER]

10:09.533 --> 10:10.100
>> OH, SHE'S COOL, SHE'S

10:10.166 --> 10:11.200
JUST GONNA LET YOU TAKE

10:11.266 --> 10:13.934
ADVANTAGE OF HER.

10:14.000 --> 10:14.934
SO MY QUESTION TO YOU IS,

10:15.000 --> 10:15.633
WHY DO YOU THINK WE DON'T DO

10:15.700 --> 10:17.200
THAT?

10:17.266 --> 10:19.400
>> UM, I'M NOT SAYING WE

10:19.467 --> 10:22.333
SHOULDN'T DO IT.

10:22.400 --> 10:23.200
I GUESS IT'S -- YEAH, IT'S

10:23.266 --> 10:24.433
REALISTIC.

10:24.500 --> 10:25.967
IT'S THE SOCIETY THAT WE'RE IN

10:26.033 --> 10:26.600
AND IT'S WHAT WE'RE USED TO AND

10:26.667 --> 10:27.767
IT'S KIND OF NORMAL JUST TO HAVE

10:27.834 --> 10:29.400
SEX WITHOUT HAVING A BIG

10:29.467 --> 10:30.200
DISCUSSION ABOUT IT.

10:30.266 --> 10:32.567
I'M NOT SAYING THAT'S RIGHT.

10:32.633 --> 10:33.400
>> IT'S NOT RIGHT!

10:33.467 --> 10:34.667
>> I WOULD LIKE TO TALK TO

10:34.767 --> 10:36.300
YOU, ISOBEL, I WOULD LIKE TO

10:36.367 --> 10:36.967
TALK TO YOU ABOUT WHAT I'VE BEEN

10:37.033 --> 10:38.467
THINKING ABOUT.

10:38.533 --> 10:42.600
>> RIGHT, WE'RE GOING TO

10:42.667 --> 10:44.200
CORNER YOU.

10:44.266 --> 10:45.266
WE'RE GONNA FIND YOU BACKSTAGE

10:45.333 --> 10:46.533
GIRL.

10:46.600 --> 10:51.266
>> YOU'RE GONNA SMASH HER.

10:51.333 --> 10:53.834
>> SHE LOOKS SO CONSERVATIVE,

10:53.900 --> 10:54.633
RIGHT, LIKE SHE'S LIKE, SHE GOT

10:54.700 --> 10:56.934
STRAIGHT A'S IN SCHOOL

10:56.967 --> 10:58.133
>> A COUPLE THINGS I'VE

10:58.200 --> 10:58.533
LEARNED, FIRSTLY

10:58.600 --> 10:59.333
THAT I HAVE INCREDIBLY BORING

10:59.400 --> 11:00.166
SEX.

11:00.233 --> 11:00.800
SECONDLY, THAT EVEN WITH THIS

11:00.867 --> 11:01.533
INCREDIBLY PROGRESSIVE AUDIENCE,

11:01.600 --> 11:02.333
THAT STILL THERE DOES SEEM TO BE

11:02.400 --> 11:03.767
GENUINE CONFUSION AROUND THE

11:03.834 --> 11:04.433
TOPIC OF CONSENT, AND SO IT'S

11:04.500 --> 11:06.967
OBVIOUSLY A MASSIVE GRAY AREA.

11:07.033 --> 11:07.800
>> IT'S HARD FOR PEOPLE TO

11:07.867 --> 11:12.133
ACCEPT.

11:12.200 --> 11:14.633
IT'S HARD FOR PEOPLE TO SAY "OH,

11:14.700 --> 11:20.233
SHIT, MAYBE I DID

11:20.300 --> 11:20.900
THAT WRONG."

11:20.967 --> 11:21.867
AND I THINK WHAT

11:21.934 --> 11:24.300
ADDS TO THAT IS THAT WE LIVE IN

11:24.367 --> 11:25.133
A SENSATIONALIZED MEDIA WORLD

11:25.200 --> 11:25.967
THAT WANTS TO DRAG PEOPLE AS

11:26.033 --> 11:30.834
SOON AS THEY TRY TO APOLOGIZE OR

11:30.900 --> 11:32.800
SAY "OH, SHIT, I REALIZE I DID

11:32.867 --> 11:33.567
IT WRONG."

11:33.633 --> 11:38.900
I SOMETIMES BECOME FRUSTRATED

11:38.967 --> 11:39.533
WITH HOW THE #MeToo MOVEMENT HAS

11:39.600 --> 11:40.767
MOVED SO FAR AWAY FROM WHAT IT

11:40.834 --> 11:41.333
STARTED AS.

11:41.400 --> 11:44.500
AN OPPORTUNITY FOR US TO CALL

11:44.567 --> 11:45.467
ATTENTION TO YOUTH OF COLOR IN

11:45.533 --> 11:46.133
DISENFRANCHISED COMMUNITIES THAT

11:46.200 --> 11:47.266
HAVE EXPERIENCED PHYSICAL

11:47.333 --> 11:50.834
ASSAULT.

11:50.900 --> 11:52.400
AND NOW IT'S LIKE, IS

11:52.467 --> 11:54.200
AZIZ ANSARI REALLY GUILTY?

11:54.266 --> 11:57.800
AND THEN I'M REMINDED, ARE YOU

11:57.867 --> 11:59.500
COMPROMISING THAT SURVIVOR'S

11:59.567 --> 12:01.233
EXPERIENCE?

12:01.300 --> 12:03.000
BECAUSE TRAUMA IS EXPERIENCED BY

12:03.066 --> 12:06.033
EVERY SINGLE PERSON DIFFERENTLY.

12:06.100 --> 12:11.567
LIKE, WHAT YOU MIGHT IDENTIFY AS

12:11.633 --> 12:12.600
TRAUMA, I MIGHT BE LIKE, "GIRL,

12:12.667 --> 12:14.100
THAT'S TUESDAY."

12:14.166 --> 12:14.800
>> SO WHAT DO YOU THINK IS THE

12:14.867 --> 12:16.433
TRUTH IN THE AZIZ ANSARI CASE?

12:16.500 --> 12:16.934
>> I THINK THERE'S A LOT

12:16.967 --> 12:18.166
OF TRUTHS.

12:18.233 --> 12:20.133
BUT I THINK THE OVERALL TRUTH IS

12:20.200 --> 12:20.734
THAT OUR SOCIETY HAS GROOMED

12:20.800 --> 12:22.300
BOTH MEN AND WOMEN NOT TO

12:22.367 --> 12:23.066
COMMUNICATE APPROPRIATELY ABOUT

12:23.133 --> 12:29.533
SEX.

12:29.600 --> 12:37.233
>> IN THE 1970s AND '80s,

12:37.300 --> 12:41.967
THE CAMPAIGN "TAKE BACK THE

12:42.033 --> 12:43.900
NIGHT" EMERGED ON COLLEGE

12:43.967 --> 12:45.200
CAMPUSES, LAYING OUT THE

12:45.266 --> 12:46.300
UNAMBIGUOUS MESSAGE THAT "NO

12:46.367 --> 12:46.867
MEANS NO" WHEN

12:46.934 --> 12:51.133
IT COMES TO SEXUAL ENCOUNTERS.

12:51.200 --> 12:51.767
BUT THE

12:51.834 --> 12:52.300
PROBLEM WITH THAT IS THAT

12:52.367 --> 12:54.834
ANYTHING APART FROM NO COULD BY

12:54.900 --> 12:55.834
DEFAULT MEAN YES,

12:55.900 --> 12:56.433
WHICH IS WHY MANY UNIVERSITIES

12:56.500 --> 12:57.200
ACROSS THE COUNTRY ARE NOW

12:57.266 --> 12:58.166
INSTATING AFFIRMATIVE CONSENT

12:58.233 --> 12:58.734
POLICIES WHERE ONLY A CLEAR

12:58.800 --> 13:01.734
VERBAL YES MEANS YES.

13:01.800 --> 13:02.533
>> WHAT DO YOU FEEL ABOUT

13:02.600 --> 13:03.967
AFFIRMATIVE CONSENT?

13:04.033 --> 13:04.600
YOU KNOW NEEDING TO HAVE A YES,

13:04.667 --> 13:05.233
A SOLID YES BEFORE YOU CAN MOVE

13:05.300 --> 13:06.100
AHEAD WITH ANYTHING.

13:06.166 --> 13:06.667
>> IT'LL MAKE YOUR DICK GET

13:06.734 --> 13:08.066
SOFT.

13:08.133 --> 13:10.233
>> IF YOUR DICK CAN'T

13:10.300 --> 13:12.033
WITHSTAND A SIMPLE QUESTION,

13:12.100 --> 13:13.266
THEN IT SHOULD WILT LIKE THE

13:13.333 --> 13:14.066
SHITTY FLOWER THAT IT IS.

13:14.133 --> 13:16.433
>> IF YOU'RE ASKING AT EVERY

13:16.500 --> 13:17.200
STEP DURING A SEXUAL EXPERIENCE,

13:17.266 --> 13:19.767
"DO I HAVE YOUR PERMISSION TO

13:19.834 --> 13:21.266
KISS YOU?"

13:21.333 --> 13:22.467
"DO I HAVE YOUR PERMISSION TO

13:22.533 --> 13:23.567
TAKE OFF YOUR UNDERWEAR?"

13:23.633 --> 13:24.200
THAT'S DEFINITELY GONNA KILL THE

13:24.266 --> 13:24.600
VIBE.

13:24.667 --> 13:26.166
>> THEY GOT TO FLOW INTO THE

13:26.233 --> 13:28.767
MOMENT, MAN, YOU AIN'T OUT HERE

13:28.834 --> 13:29.967
JUST LIKE "OH, CAN I TOUCH YOUR

13:30.033 --> 13:34.934
TITTY?

13:35.000 --> 13:36.800
CAN I TOUCH YOUR" --

13:36.867 --> 13:38.066
LIKE, AIN'T NOBODY GOT TIME FOR

13:38.133 --> 13:38.600
THAT SHIT.

13:38.667 --> 13:39.266
>> I THINK IT WOULD BE BETTER TO

13:39.333 --> 13:40.367
BE AWKWARD THAN TO BE IN THE

13:40.433 --> 13:41.100
WRONG.

13:41.166 --> 13:41.734
>> YOU GOT TO, YOU GOT TO

13:41.800 --> 13:43.467
READ THOSE SIGNS I GUESS.

13:43.533 --> 13:44.066
AND THAT'S, I MEAN WHAT'S HARD

13:44.133 --> 13:45.166
TO ME IS READING THOSE SIGNS.

13:45.233 --> 13:47.433
>> WE'RE AT NORTHEASTERN

13:47.500 --> 13:48.900
UNIVERSITY IN BOSTON ABOUT TO

13:48.967 --> 13:50.500
GO MEET DR. LISA BARRETT, WHO'S

13:50.567 --> 13:52.200
A NEUROSCIENTIST WHO CAN HELP US

13:52.266 --> 13:53.633
UNDERSTAND HOW THE WAY THAT OUR

13:53.700 --> 13:54.767
BRAINS WORK ACTUALLY CREATE

13:54.834 --> 14:02.934
CONFUSION AROUND CONSENT.

14:02.967 --> 14:05.133
>> THIS STUDY WAS DESIGNED TO

14:05.200 --> 14:07.133
FIGURE OUT, WHEN WE INFLUENCE

14:07.200 --> 14:08.867
YOUR PHYSICAL STATE IN A

14:08.967 --> 14:09.500
PARTICULAR WAY, HOW DOES THAT

14:09.567 --> 14:12.533
CHANGE THE WAY YOU SEE OTHER

14:12.600 --> 14:12.767
PEOPLE.

14:12.834 --> 14:14.166
>> OKAY.

14:14.233 --> 14:14.400
>> ALL

14:14.467 --> 14:15.200
ALL RIGHT.

14:15.266 --> 14:18.700
>> ANYTHING FEEL LIKE IT IS

14:18.767 --> 14:19.133
TALKING OR PULLING?

14:19.200 --> 14:21.734
>> NO, IT FEELS COMPLETELY

14:21.800 --> 14:21.967
NORMAL.

14:22.033 --> 14:22.934
>> THIS TEST ATTEMPTS

14:23.000 --> 14:23.533
TO MEASURE THE THEORY THAT OUR

14:23.600 --> 14:24.333
MOOD INFLUENCES WHAT WE SEE: IF

14:24.400 --> 14:25.700
WE FEEL GOOD, THEN WE TEND TO

14:25.767 --> 14:26.300
JUDGE OTHERS MORE POSITIVELY.

14:26.367 --> 14:27.033
I WAS ASKED TO RATE NEUTRAL

14:27.100 --> 14:28.033
FACES ON LIKEABILITY,

14:28.100 --> 14:28.800
RELIABILITY, AND

14:28.867 --> 14:30.934
TRUSTWORTHINESS.

14:30.967 --> 14:32.300
BUT UNKNOWN TO MY CONSCIOUS

14:32.367 --> 14:33.767
MIND, FLASHING IMAGES OF

14:33.834 --> 14:35.633
SCOWLING OR SMILING FACES WERE

14:35.700 --> 14:37.734
SHOWN SPLIT-SECONDS BEFORE TO

14:37.800 --> 14:38.967
INFLUENCE MY ANSWERS, WHICH WERE

14:39.033 --> 14:39.734
THEN RECORDED ALONG WITH MY

14:39.800 --> 14:47.633
HEART RATE AND PERSPIRATION.

14:47.700 --> 14:50.000
>> LOOKING AT YOUR SKIN

14:50.066 --> 14:54.200
CONDUCTANCE, THERE ARE SPECIFIC

14:54.266 --> 14:56.066
PEAKS A COUPLE OF SECONDS AFTER

14:56.133 --> 14:58.300
YOU WERE FACED WITH PROBABLY A

14:58.367 --> 15:01.433
SCOWLING FACE WOULD BE MY GUESS.

15:01.500 --> 15:01.700
>> REALLY?

15:01.767 --> 15:05.166
>> YES, IT WAS A CHANGE IN YOUR

15:05.233 --> 15:05.500
GUT FEELINGS.

15:05.567 --> 15:06.066
BASICALLY, WHEN YOU'RE IN A

15:06.133 --> 15:07.367
PLEASANT STATE YOU THINK SOMEONE

15:07.433 --> 15:07.934
WITH A NEUTRAL FACE IS MORE

15:07.967 --> 15:08.533
TRUSTWORTHY AND WHEN YOU'RE IN

15:08.600 --> 15:09.967
AN UNPLEASANT STATE YOU THINK

15:10.033 --> 15:10.400
THAT THE PERSON IS

15:10.467 --> 15:11.400
LESS TRUSTWORTHY.

15:11.467 --> 15:12.700
THESE ARE BEAUTIFUL RESULTS FROM

15:12.767 --> 15:14.467
A SCIENTIFIC STANDPOINT.

15:14.533 --> 15:15.066
>> FROM MY STANDPOINT, NOT SO

15:15.133 --> 15:17.033
GREAT.

15:17.100 --> 15:18.500
>> WELL, WHAT I ALWAYS TELL

15:18.567 --> 15:19.200
PEOPLE IS, YOU KNOW, AS A

15:19.266 --> 15:19.767
SCIENTIST, I LOVE RESULTS LIKE

15:19.867 --> 15:21.900
THIS.

15:21.967 --> 15:22.867
AS A HUMAN PERSON, I FIND THEM

15:22.934 --> 15:24.667
HORRIFYING ACTUALLY.

15:24.734 --> 15:28.467
>> YEAH, THEY'RE TERRIFYING!

15:28.533 --> 15:29.734
HOW DOES US GUESSING OR

15:29.800 --> 15:30.367
MISREADING PEOPLE, HOW DOES THAT

15:30.433 --> 15:33.400
PLAY OUT IN A SEXUAL ENCOUNTER?

15:33.467 --> 15:35.734
>> IF YOUR DESIRE IS TO HAVE

15:35.800 --> 15:38.600
SEX WITH SOMEONE, YOU ARE MORE

15:38.667 --> 15:40.600
LIKELY TO INTERPRET, TO PERCEIVE

15:40.667 --> 15:42.967
ACTIONS AS SIGNALING INTENT.

15:43.033 --> 15:44.767
>> ISN'T IT DANGEROUS TO EXCUSE

15:44.834 --> 15:46.367
BAD BEHAVIOR BECAUSE WE'RE

15:46.433 --> 15:48.633
SAYING THAT THIS IS JUST THE WAY

15:48.700 --> 15:49.967
THAT OUR BRAINS WORK?

15:50.033 --> 15:50.934
>> I WANT TO BE REALLY CLEAR.

15:50.967 --> 15:52.333
I'M NOT TALKING ABOUT SEXUAL

15:52.400 --> 15:53.133
HARASSMENT OR RAPE.

15:53.200 --> 15:54.467
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT

15:54.533 --> 15:55.800
MISUNDERSTANDINGS THAT HAPPEN

15:55.867 --> 15:57.700
BETWEEN TWO ADULTS WHO ARE

15:57.767 --> 16:01.300
CAPABLE OF GIVING THEIR CONSENT.

16:01.367 --> 16:04.033
TO SAY THAT ONE PERSON COULD

16:04.100 --> 16:06.033
BELIEVE THAT THEY HAD BEEN GIVEN

16:06.100 --> 16:08.300
CONSENT AND ANOTHER PERSON

16:08.367 --> 16:11.166
BELIEVES THAT THEY REALLY NEVER

16:11.233 --> 16:12.300
GAVE IT, AND IT REALLY IS

16:12.367 --> 16:13.867
POSSIBLE FOR BOTH OF THOSE

16:13.934 --> 16:15.100
THINGS TO BE TRUE, EVEN WHEN

16:15.166 --> 16:17.567
EVERYBODY HAS THE BEST

16:17.633 --> 16:18.100
INTENTIONS.

16:18.166 --> 16:19.433
>> SO IS THE SOLUTION TO HAVE

16:19.500 --> 16:21.600
CONSTANT VERBAL CONSENT?

16:21.667 --> 16:23.200
>> IT COULD BE THE DIFFERENCE

16:23.266 --> 16:25.667
BETWEEN A REALLY GREAT

16:25.734 --> 16:27.200
EXPERIENCE AND A REALLY HORRIBLE

16:27.266 --> 16:29.200
EXPERIENCE.

16:29.266 --> 16:29.800
>> COMMUNICATION IS

16:29.867 --> 16:32.166
KEY.

16:32.233 --> 16:33.834
BUT HOW DO WE HANDLE THE

16:33.900 --> 16:35.233
COUNTLESS SITUATIONS WHERE

16:35.300 --> 16:36.433
MISCOMMUNICATION HAS CAUSED

16:36.500 --> 16:38.200
HARM?

16:38.266 --> 16:39.600
>> I AM LIVING WITH MY

16:39.667 --> 16:41.400
TRAUMAS EVERY SINGLE DAY AND

16:41.467 --> 16:41.867
EVERY SINGLE MOMENT.

16:41.934 --> 16:42.700
I CANNOT IMAGINE FOR A SECOND

16:42.767 --> 16:45.133
THAT ANY OF THE

16:45.200 --> 16:46.500
PEOPLE THAT HAVE HURT ME

16:46.567 --> 16:47.633
STRUGGLE WITH THAT OR DEAL WITH

16:47.700 --> 16:49.633
THAT OR MOVE THROUGH THE WORLD

16:49.700 --> 16:51.867
ANY DIFFERENTLY BECAUSE OF THAT

16:51.934 --> 16:56.834
IF THERE WAS A WAY FOR

16:56.900 --> 16:58.166
THEM TO APOLOGIZE TO THE PEOPLE,

16:58.233 --> 17:02.967
DIRECTLY TO THE PEOPLE THAT THEY

17:03.033 --> 17:07.166
HURT...

17:07.233 --> 17:08.100
>> WOULD I FEEL, UH, MORE CALM

17:08.166 --> 17:08.433
ABOUT IT?

17:08.500 --> 17:09.667
WOULD I FEEL HEALED BY HAVING IT

17:09.734 --> 17:13.834
DONE?

17:13.900 --> 17:15.867
I DON'T KNOW, BUT I THINK

17:15.934 --> 17:17.000
FOR SOME PEOPLE, ABSOLUTELY.

17:17.066 --> 17:17.900
>> I WOULD LIKE TO SIT DOWN

17:17.967 --> 17:20.000
WITH THE PERSON WHO HURT ME, UM,

17:20.066 --> 17:22.133
AND HAVE THAT CONVERSATION.

17:22.200 --> 17:24.200
IF I HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO DO

17:24.266 --> 17:24.700
SO, I WOULD TAKE IT.

17:24.767 --> 17:25.533
>> IF I THINK ABOUT REACHING OUT

17:25.600 --> 17:26.800
TO THE PEOPLE THAT I'VE

17:26.867 --> 17:29.200
PERSONALLY BEEN IN THESE

17:29.266 --> 17:32.033
SITUATIONS WITH, IT'S JUST

17:32.100 --> 17:33.533
INCREDIBLY AWKWARD AND

17:33.600 --> 17:36.133
UNCOMFORTABLE CONVERSATIONS TO

17:36.200 --> 17:38.166
HAVE.

17:38.233 --> 17:44.867
SO I'M REALLY CURIOUS TO KNOW

17:44.934 --> 17:46.433
HOW PEOPLE ARE ABLE TO INSTIGATE

17:46.500 --> 17:47.734
THOSE CONVERSATIONS, AND WHAT

17:47.800 --> 17:54.200
THEY LOOK LIKE IN REALITY.

17:54.266 --> 17:55.100
ALEXIS

17:55.166 --> 17:55.800
AND A MAN WE'VE AGREED TO CALL

17:55.867 --> 17:56.800
JAMES.

17:56.867 --> 17:57.734
THEY'RE EMBRACING A SIMPLE YET

17:57.800 --> 17:58.633
RADICAL IDEA: TALKING OUT THEIR

17:58.700 --> 18:03.100
SEXUAL ENCOUNTER FACE-TO-FACE.

18:03.166 --> 18:04.233
>> SO ABOUT 10 YEARS AGO, JAMES

18:04.300 --> 18:05.633
AND ALEXIS WERE AT COLLEGE

18:05.700 --> 18:06.166
TOGETHER AND THEY WOUND UP

18:06.233 --> 18:09.200
HAVING SEX.

18:09.266 --> 18:10.400
THAT IS AN EVENT THAT JAMES PUT

18:10.467 --> 18:12.300
DOWN TO BEING A DRUNKEN

18:12.367 --> 18:14.300
ENCOUNTER THAT BOTH OF THEM WERE

18:14.367 --> 18:16.266
RESPONSIBLE FOR.

18:16.367 --> 18:18.100
THAT IS WHAT HE'S BELIEVED FOR

18:18.166 --> 18:20.800
THE LAST NINE AND A HALF YEARS

18:20.867 --> 18:22.333
OR SO.

18:22.400 --> 18:23.834
AND WHICH ALEXIS PUTS DOWN TO

18:23.900 --> 18:28.433
BEING RAPE.

18:28.500 --> 18:32.734
>> AS WE GET INTO THIS,

18:32.800 --> 18:33.300
I'D LIKE TO REMIND YOU ABOUT

18:33.367 --> 18:41.567
WHAT RESTORATIVE JUSTICE IS.

18:41.633 --> 18:44.767
>> LEADING THEIR CONVERSATION,

18:44.834 --> 18:45.600
PROFESSOR ALISSA ACKERMAN, AN

18:45.667 --> 18:46.266
ADVOCATE FOR A

18:46.333 --> 18:47.300
METHOD CALLED "RESTORATIVE

18:47.367 --> 18:49.667
JUSTICE."

18:49.734 --> 18:51.934
>> ALEXIS REACHED OUT

18:51.967 --> 18:53.066
TO ME ABOUT 9 MONTHS AGO ASKING

18:53.133 --> 18:53.667
FOR SOMEBODY

18:53.734 --> 18:54.967
TO FACILITATE A RESTORATIVE

18:55.033 --> 18:55.433
JUSTICE PROCESS FOR HER.

18:55.500 --> 18:56.567
>> WHAT IS RESTORATIVE JUSTICE?

18:56.633 --> 18:57.266
>> SO RESTORATIVE JUSTICE

18:57.333 --> 18:58.033
FOCUSES ON THE HARM THAT IS

18:58.100 --> 18:59.133
CAUSED, NOT A PARTICULAR STATUTE

18:59.200 --> 18:59.633
VIOLATION.

18:59.700 --> 19:00.367
THESE TYPES OF CASES INVOLVE

19:00.433 --> 19:01.767
EVERYDAY PEOPLE WHO REALLY DON'T

19:01.834 --> 19:02.333
UNDERSTAND THE DEPTHS OF THE

19:02.400 --> 19:03.333
HARM THAT THEY'VE CAUSED.

19:03.400 --> 19:04.000
>> BY GOING THROUGH THIS

19:04.066 --> 19:04.600
RESTORATIVE JUSTICE, ALLOWING

19:04.667 --> 19:05.233
PERPETRATORS TO HAVE A VOICE IN

19:05.300 --> 19:05.834
ALL THIS, ARE WE NOT EXCUSING

19:05.900 --> 19:07.066
THEM?

19:07.133 --> 19:07.800
>> SO I ACTUALLY THINK THAT

19:07.867 --> 19:08.533
THIS HOLDS THEM MORE ACCOUNTABLE

19:08.600 --> 19:09.233
THAN THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE

19:09.300 --> 19:10.100
PROCESS DOES.

19:10.166 --> 19:11.700
THE FACT OF THE MATTER IS THAT

19:11.767 --> 19:12.400
FOR EVERY THOUSAND RAPES

19:12.467 --> 19:14.934
COMMITTED IN THIS COUNTRY, ONLY

19:14.967 --> 19:15.800
SIX PEOPLE WILL GO TO PRISON.

19:15.867 --> 19:17.333
THIS OFFERS AN OPPORTUNITY FOR

19:17.400 --> 19:17.967
SURVIVORS TO GET WHAT THEY

19:18.033 --> 19:19.033
ACTUALLY SAY THAT THEY NEED,

19:19.100 --> 19:20.133
WHICH IS A VOICE, SOME

19:20.200 --> 19:21.033
VALIDATION, AND THE ABILITY TO

19:21.100 --> 19:21.867
TELL THEIR STORY IN A PLACE THAT

19:21.934 --> 19:25.367
THEY'RE SAFE.

19:25.433 --> 19:28.266
>> ALEXIS REACHED OUT TO ALISSA

19:28.333 --> 19:30.133
FOR HELP NEARLY A YEAR AGO.

19:30.200 --> 19:32.133
AT JAMES' REQUEST, WE'VE

19:32.233 --> 19:33.133
AGREED TO OBSCURE BOTH OF THEIR

19:33.200 --> 19:35.266
FACES.

19:35.333 --> 19:35.867
>> YOU WERE THE ONE THAT

19:35.934 --> 19:37.734
INITIATED THIS RESTORATIVE

19:37.800 --> 19:43.633
JUSTICE PROCESS.

19:43.700 --> 19:44.400
>> MM-HMM.

19:44.467 --> 19:45.000
>> WHY?

19:45.066 --> 19:45.600
AND HOW DID YOU GO ABOUT DOING

19:45.667 --> 19:47.066
THAT?

19:47.133 --> 19:48.667
>> YEAH, I THINK IT WAS JUST

19:48.734 --> 19:49.367
A LAST-DITCH EFFORT, YOU KNOW?

19:49.433 --> 19:50.100
I HAD DONE EVERY KIND OF THERAPY

19:50.166 --> 19:50.834
AND THOUGHT EVERY KIND OF

19:50.900 --> 19:52.200
THOUGHT, AND IT STILL JUST

19:52.266 --> 19:55.700
WASN'T DOING IT.

19:55.767 --> 19:58.800
AND UM, I DON'T KNOW, IT WAS

19:58.867 --> 20:00.033
JUST, LIKE, FUCK IT.

20:00.100 --> 20:01.266
HE HAD LIKE THE MISSING PIECE OF

20:01.333 --> 20:01.867
THIS PUZZLE, AND THAT WAS JUST

20:01.934 --> 20:02.867
WHAT I NEEDED, YOU KNOW, TO NOT

20:02.934 --> 20:03.533
HAVE IT HURT THE SAME WAY.

20:03.600 --> 20:04.500
>> DO YOU HAVE THAT EMAIL THAT

20:04.567 --> 20:06.967
YOU FIRST SENT TO HIM?

20:07.033 --> 20:08.800
>> I DO, YEAH.

20:08.867 --> 20:09.800
SO I WROTE, "I WONDER IF YOU'RE

20:09.867 --> 20:11.166
FORCED TO THINK ABOUT IT EVERY

20:11.233 --> 20:12.667
DAY, LIKE I AM.

20:12.734 --> 20:13.834
I WONDER IF YOU KNOW HOW IT

20:13.900 --> 20:16.433
FEELS TRYING TO STOP CRYING ON

20:16.500 --> 20:23.200
THE WAY TO WORK WHEN WEINSTEIN

20:23.266 --> 20:24.166
AND AILES AND BROCK TURNER JUST

20:24.233 --> 20:25.433
KEEP WINNING.

20:25.500 --> 20:27.633
I WONDER IF YOU KNOW ABOUT THE

20:27.700 --> 20:29.700
YEARS OF THERAPY AND A DECADE

20:29.767 --> 20:30.266
OF PANIC ATTACKS OR WHEN THE

20:30.333 --> 20:31.533
DOCTORS TOLD ME I'D PROBABLY BE

20:31.600 --> 20:32.133
MANAGING THE PTSD FOR THE REST

20:32.200 --> 20:33.066
OF MY LIFE.

20:33.133 --> 20:33.900
I WONDER IF YOU KNOW WHAT IT

20:33.967 --> 20:34.734
FEELS LIKE WHEN YOUR BODY TAKES

20:34.800 --> 20:36.767
OVER, WHEN IT CONTORTS INTO

20:36.834 --> 20:37.767
PANIC AND YOU LOSE CONTROL OF

20:37.834 --> 20:38.967
YOUR BREATH BUT YOUR BRAIN

20:39.033 --> 20:41.033
CAN'T OVERRIDE THE SYSTEM.

20:41.100 --> 20:42.867
I NEVER GET TO FORGET, BECAUSE

20:42.967 --> 20:43.934
EVEN WHEN I DO, MY BODY

20:44.000 --> 20:47.400
REMEMBERS.

20:47.467 --> 20:48.900
I WONDER IF YOU KNOW WHAT

20:48.967 --> 20:50.100
HAPPENED BACK THEN.

20:50.166 --> 20:51.967
THAT I DROPPED OUT OF SCHOOL,

20:52.033 --> 20:54.500
THAT I FLED FROM EVERYTHING I

20:54.567 --> 20:56.133
KNEW, THAT I HAD NOW COME TO

20:56.200 --> 20:57.667
DISTRUST, AND THAT FINALLY I

20:57.734 --> 21:01.266
ATTEMPTED SUICIDE.

21:01.333 --> 21:03.500
BUT PROBABLY THE WORST PART OF

21:03.567 --> 21:05.367
ALL OF IT IS THAT I WONDER IF

21:05.433 --> 21:06.667
YOU KNOW THAT IT'S IN YOUR POWER

21:06.734 --> 21:08.967
TO PUT A STOP TO THIS FOR ME.

21:09.066 --> 21:10.734
IT'S ALWAYS BEEN IN YOUR POWER.

21:10.800 --> 21:11.767
YOU COULD STILL SAY YOU'RE SORRY

21:11.834 --> 21:12.567
TODAY.

21:12.633 --> 21:13.867
YOU COULD FIX THIS AT ANY

21:13.934 --> 21:15.500
MOMENT.

21:15.567 --> 21:17.600
WE COULD SIT DOWN AND FIGURE OUT

21:17.667 --> 21:19.767
HOW TO HEAL TOGETHER.

21:19.834 --> 21:21.133
I CAN NEVER CHANGE WHAT

21:21.200 --> 21:25.266
HAPPENED, BUT YOU CAN START TO

21:25.333 --> 21:25.934
REPAIR THE DAMAGE ANY DAY YOU

21:26.000 --> 21:31.200
WANT."

21:31.266 --> 21:36.233
>> ON THE RECEIVING SIDE OF THAT

21:36.300 --> 21:38.266
EMAIL, JAMES, WHO AT ONE TIME

21:38.333 --> 21:38.834
CONSIDERED ALEXIS ONE OF HIS

21:38.900 --> 21:40.433
BEST FRIENDS.

21:40.500 --> 21:41.100
HE ASKED US TO ALTER HIS REAL

21:41.166 --> 21:41.967
VOICE.

21:42.033 --> 21:43.934
>> ALEXIS REACHED OUT TO YOU A

21:43.967 --> 21:45.200
FEW MONTHS AGO.

21:45.266 --> 21:45.567
HOW DID YOU FEEL

21:45.633 --> 21:46.834
WHEN YOU RECEIVED THAT EMAIL?

21:46.900 --> 21:47.400
>> IT COMPLETELY STOPPED ME

21:47.467 --> 21:47.767
IN MY TRACKS.

21:47.834 --> 21:49.400
I WAS WALKING DOWN THE STREET

21:49.467 --> 21:50.300
AND I, I...

21:50.367 --> 21:51.667
STOOD THERE AND READ IT OVER AND

21:51.734 --> 21:53.600
OVER AGAIN.

21:53.667 --> 21:55.734
HER BEING SO HONEST REALLY

21:55.800 --> 21:57.233
BROUGHT ME TO THE TABLE AND MADE

21:57.300 --> 21:58.967
ME REALIZE THAT I

21:59.033 --> 22:01.800
NEED TO DEAL WITH THIS.

22:01.867 --> 22:02.567
THIS IS -- YOU KNOW, I OWE IT TO

22:02.633 --> 22:03.667
THIS PERSON.

22:03.734 --> 22:06.567
MY FRIENDS AND FAMILY CAUTIONED

22:06.633 --> 22:08.266
ME AGAINST SPEAKING WITH ALEXIS

22:08.333 --> 22:09.433
OR BEING HONEST WITH HER OR

22:09.500 --> 22:10.934
EVEN COMMUNICATING WITH HER.

22:11.000 --> 22:12.200
BUT I CARE A LOT ABOUT THIS

22:12.266 --> 22:13.834
PROCESS AND I CARE A LOT ABOUT

22:13.900 --> 22:19.300
ALEXIS, SO ULTIMATELY, THAT'S

22:19.367 --> 22:25.100
WHY I'M HERE.

22:25.166 --> 22:29.900
>> UM...

22:29.967 --> 22:33.033
I THINK, IN TERMS OF BASIC

22:33.100 --> 22:41.500
DETAILS, I REMEMBER THAT WE HAD

22:41.567 --> 22:43.500
BEEN DRINKING A LOT AND

22:43.567 --> 22:45.066
SOMEONE -- I CAN'T REMEMBER

22:45.133 --> 22:50.934
EXACTLY WHO OR HOW THEY WERE

22:50.967 --> 22:51.834
BROUGHT THERE BUT, UM, WE HAD

22:51.900 --> 22:53.100
POT BROWNIES.

22:53.166 --> 22:55.467
AND I REMEMBER YOU WENT TO YOUR

22:55.533 --> 22:57.533
ROOM, I WENT TO MY ROOM, BUT I

22:57.600 --> 22:59.367
WAS SO PASSED OUT AT THIS POINT,

22:59.433 --> 23:01.166
AND I JUST REMEMBER THESE

23:01.233 --> 23:03.700
FLASHES OF A FACE ABOVE ME BUT

23:03.767 --> 23:05.667
IT DIDN'T MAKE SENSE, AND, AND

23:05.767 --> 23:07.367
THEN THERE WAS LIKE LITTLE

23:07.433 --> 23:08.333
THINGS LIKE, UH, I

23:08.400 --> 23:09.700
REMEMBER FINDING UNDERWEAR IN MY

23:09.767 --> 23:10.934
ROOM AND, UH, I TOLD MYSELF IT

23:11.000 --> 23:11.800
WAS A DREAM AND THAT THE THINGS

23:11.867 --> 23:14.033
I THOUGHT I HAD SEEN AND

23:14.100 --> 23:17.033
IMAGINED JUST COULDN'T BE REAL,

23:17.100 --> 23:18.433
LIKE, REALLY NOT -- NOT WANTING

23:18.500 --> 23:20.734
TO FACE THE NEXT LEVEL OF THIS

23:20.800 --> 23:22.333
LINE OF QUESTIONING.

23:22.400 --> 23:23.066
>> THERE'S A LOT THAT I

23:23.133 --> 23:23.867
DON'T REMEMBER.

23:23.934 --> 23:25.767
HOW I GOT INTO YOUR ROOM, WHY I

23:25.834 --> 23:28.367
CAME INTO YOUR ROOM, UH, WHEN IT

23:28.433 --> 23:28.867
HAPPENED -- ANY OF THOSE

23:28.934 --> 23:31.433
DETAILS.

23:31.500 --> 23:35.300
THE FIRST MEMORIES I HAVE ARE

23:35.367 --> 23:40.800
OF ME BEING ON TOP OF YOU IN

23:40.867 --> 23:41.867
YOUR BED, UM, AND THAT

23:41.934 --> 23:49.600
EXPERIENCE -- I WAS ABLE TO

23:49.667 --> 23:51.200
NORMALIZE IT BECAUSE, I, UH --

23:51.266 --> 23:52.600
JUST WANT TO BE CAREFUL WITH THE

23:52.667 --> 23:54.300
WORDS I USE, BUT YOU WERE ACTIVE

23:54.367 --> 23:56.400
IN THE PROCESS IN THE SENSE THAT

23:56.467 --> 24:04.567
YOU WEREN'T UNCONSCIOUS, AND SO

24:04.633 --> 24:06.133
FOR -- THAT IMAGE AND THAT

24:06.200 --> 24:07.633
MEMORY OF THAT PORTION OF IT WAS

24:07.700 --> 24:11.333
WHAT ALLOWED ME TO CALL IT SEX

24:11.400 --> 24:12.967
FOR NINE YEARS.

24:13.066 --> 24:14.967
AND IT HAD BEEN ESTABLISHED,

24:15.066 --> 24:16.567
KIND OF THROUGH OUR FRIENDS,

24:16.633 --> 24:18.867
THAT YOU FELT THIS WAS RAPE, AND

24:18.934 --> 24:20.333
I HAD FELT THAT THIS WAS A

24:20.400 --> 24:21.967
DRUNKEN SEXUAL EXPERIENCE, AND I

24:22.033 --> 24:24.266
WASN'T READY TO HAVE THAT

24:24.333 --> 24:27.266
CONVERSATION WITH MYSELF.

24:27.333 --> 24:29.100
I WAS A GOOD PERSON, HOW COULD I

24:29.166 --> 24:30.200
POSSIBLY DO THAT TO YOU?

24:30.266 --> 24:32.367
TO ONE OF MY BEST FRIENDS?

24:32.433 --> 24:34.333
[SIGHS]

24:34.400 --> 24:36.500
AND THAT OPINION WAS VALIDATED

24:36.567 --> 24:40.400
BY, YOU KNOW, FRIENDS OF MINE.

24:40.467 --> 24:41.633
>> IT BECAME THE DEFAULT,

24:41.700 --> 24:44.934
WAS TO BELIEVE YOU.

24:44.967 --> 24:47.967
AND I BECAME THIS SOURCE OF

24:48.066 --> 24:55.467
PROBLEM IN OUR COMMUNITY, THIS

24:55.533 --> 24:56.633
SOURCE OF -- LIKE AN

24:56.700 --> 25:02.333
INCONGRUITY.

25:02.400 --> 25:05.200
NO ONE, NO ONE COULD IMAGINE

25:05.266 --> 25:06.767
YOU -- I DIDN'T WANT TO SEE YOU

25:06.834 --> 25:07.333
LIKE THIS.

25:07.400 --> 25:08.100
NO ONE COULD IMAGINE YOU LIKE

25:08.166 --> 25:09.567
THIS, AND IT WAS EASIER TO

25:09.633 --> 25:10.867
DISMISS IT, AND SO BY DEFAULT

25:10.934 --> 25:11.867
EVERYONE BELIEVED YOU, AND YOU

25:11.934 --> 25:13.100
DIDN'T HAVE TO DO ANYTHING OR

25:13.166 --> 25:13.700
CHANGE ANYTHING AND YOU GOT TO

25:13.767 --> 25:14.734
KEEP EVERYTHING THE WAY IT WAS

25:14.800 --> 25:15.367
AND I HAD TO LEAVE EVERYTHING

25:15.433 --> 25:16.433
AND LEAVE EVERYBODY.

25:16.500 --> 25:18.433
>> ONE OF MY BIGGEST REGRETS

25:18.500 --> 25:19.500
THROUGHOUT ALL OF THIS IS, IN

25:19.567 --> 25:20.767
ADDITION TO, YOU KNOW, HURTING

25:20.834 --> 25:22.867
YOU THAT NIGHT AND CAUSING THAT

25:22.934 --> 25:28.700
TRAUMA, I HAD 10 YEARS OF

25:28.767 --> 25:40.500
OPPORTUNITIES TO RIGHT THAT, AND

25:40.567 --> 25:42.633
I...

25:42.700 --> 25:46.166
I -- I DISCARDED YOU IN THIS

25:46.233 --> 25:49.433
PROCESS AND...

25:49.500 --> 25:54.367
[SIGHS]

25:54.433 --> 25:57.600
>> THANK YOU FOR SAYING THAT.

25:57.667 --> 25:59.233
>> THIS WHOLE INTERACTION IS

25:59.300 --> 26:02.100
PRETTY INCREDIBLE TO WATCH.

26:02.166 --> 26:04.900
I MEAN, IT'S SO RAW AND

26:04.967 --> 26:06.033
EMOTIONAL AND BRUTALLY, BRUTALLY

26:06.100 --> 26:08.600
HONEST AND HUMAN.

26:08.667 --> 26:10.767
I MEAN, THESE GUYS ARE JUST

26:10.834 --> 26:13.600
SITTING, HAVING A VERY SIMPLE

26:13.667 --> 26:15.367
CONVERSATION, AND IT'S AN

26:15.433 --> 26:18.000
INCREDIBLY DIFFICULT

26:18.066 --> 26:20.133
CONVERSATION TO HAVE, AND YET

26:20.200 --> 26:22.467
THERE'S SO MUCH HUMANITY AND

26:22.533 --> 26:23.867
SOMEHOW UNDERSTANDING AND

26:23.934 --> 26:28.300
FORGIVENESS HERE.

26:28.367 --> 26:29.834
>> I REALIZE THAT WE

26:29.900 --> 26:30.834
HAVEN'T CALLED IT WHAT IT IS.

26:30.900 --> 26:32.467
MAYBE WE SHOULD BE CALLING IT

26:32.533 --> 26:33.100
WHAT IT IS.

26:33.166 --> 26:39.600
I WONDER IF YOU CAN DO THAT.

26:39.667 --> 26:41.400
>> FOR THE LONGEST TIME, I --

26:41.467 --> 26:42.033
I DIDN'T SEE IT AS HOW I SEE IT

26:42.100 --> 26:42.967
NOW.

26:43.033 --> 26:45.266
I MEAN, TO ANSWER YOUR QUESTION,

26:45.333 --> 26:51.066
YEAH, IT WAS -- IT WAS RAPE.

26:51.133 --> 26:52.567
UH, THAT'S NOT EASY TO SAY,

26:52.633 --> 26:56.100
BOTH BECAUSE I KNOW WHAT IT'S

26:56.166 --> 27:01.533
DONE TO YOU AND I KNOW THERE'S A

27:01.600 --> 27:05.300
YOU KNOW, FLASH OF FEAR EVERY

27:05.367 --> 27:08.100
TIME I ASSOCIATE WITH IT.

27:08.166 --> 27:10.600
[SIGHS]

27:10.667 --> 27:13.633
UM...

27:13.700 --> 27:14.433
>> AT THAT POINT IN TIME,

27:14.500 --> 27:15.533
THERE WAS JUST TWO WORDS FOR

27:15.600 --> 27:16.967
THIS.

27:17.033 --> 27:18.400
THERE WAS JUST VICTIM AND

27:18.467 --> 27:19.567
RAPIST, AND I DON'T THINK EITHER

27:19.633 --> 27:20.133
OF US WANTED TO BE EITHER OF

27:20.200 --> 27:21.000
THOSE THINGS.

27:21.066 --> 27:22.367
I DIDN'T THINK YOU WERE A BAD

27:22.433 --> 27:23.166
PERSON.

27:23.233 --> 27:24.567
I THOUGHT YOU HAD DONE A

27:24.633 --> 27:26.934
BAD THING.

27:27.000 --> 27:29.100
>> NOW, ALEXIS, FOR YOU, THE

27:29.166 --> 27:35.633
DECISION TO DO THIS WAS AN EASY

27:35.700 --> 27:37.233
ONE, BUT WHEN YOU WERE ASKED TO

27:37.300 --> 27:39.033
DO IT IN SHADOW, THAT WAS VERY

27:39.100 --> 27:39.800
VERY HARD FOR YOU.

27:39.867 --> 27:40.667
>> YEAH.

27:40.734 --> 27:42.100
IT WAS REALLY DIFFICULT.

27:42.166 --> 27:43.633
IF MY HEALING PROCESS IS ONE OF

27:43.700 --> 27:44.667
EMBODYING EVEN THE WORSE THINGS

27:44.734 --> 27:46.233
THAT HAVE HAPPENED TO ME AND

27:46.300 --> 27:48.834
EMBODYING WHO I'VE BECOME SINCE

27:48.900 --> 27:50.033
THEN AND WHAT I HAD BECOME,

27:50.100 --> 27:51.300
THIS WAS, LIKE, A STEP IN THE

27:51.367 --> 27:52.667
OPPOSITE DIRECTION.

27:52.767 --> 27:53.800
BUT WE'RE NOT REALLY MOVING THE

27:53.867 --> 27:55.433
NEEDLE AT ALL UNTIL MEN START

27:55.500 --> 27:57.400
DOING IT, AND YOUR WORDS HAVE

27:57.467 --> 28:02.533
THE POTENTIAL TO REACH ANY OTHER

28:02.600 --> 28:03.567
MAN AND SHOW THAT THERE'S A PATH

28:03.633 --> 28:05.300
TO TAKING RESPONSIBILITY.

28:05.367 --> 28:07.533
THIS FEELS BETTER, TO APPRECIATE

28:07.600 --> 28:08.767
THE FACT THAT WE ALL HAVE THE

28:08.834 --> 28:10.333
CAPACITY TO HARM, AND WE ALL

28:10.400 --> 28:14.533
HAVE THE CAPACITY TO BE HARMED.

28:14.600 --> 28:16.166
>> RESTORATIVE JUSTICE

28:16.233 --> 28:18.033
ISN'T A SOLUTION FOR EVERYONE.

28:18.100 --> 28:19.767
FOR SOME, CONFRONTING AN

28:19.834 --> 28:20.667
ASSAILANT DOES NOT EQUAL

28:20.734 --> 28:22.967
JUSTICE.

28:23.066 --> 28:25.033
FOR OTHERS, ADMITTING TO

28:25.100 --> 28:27.200
ACTIONS THAT COULD HAVE REAL

28:27.266 --> 28:28.934
CRIMINAL CONSEQUENCES IS OUT OF

28:29.000 --> 28:30.934
THE QUESTION.

28:31.000 --> 28:32.467
BUT AT LEAST FOR ALEXIS AND

28:32.533 --> 28:33.834
JAMES IT IS PROVIDING THE

28:33.900 --> 28:35.734
BEGINNING OF A WAY FORWARD.

28:35.800 --> 28:37.066
AND AS DISTURBING AND

28:37.133 --> 28:38.667
TRANSFORMATIVE AS THE LAST YEAR

28:38.734 --> 28:39.834
OF FRENZIED MEDIA COVERAGE HAS

28:39.900 --> 28:41.333
BEEN, WHAT SO MANY OF US WANT IS

28:41.400 --> 28:43.467
AN OPPORTUNITY TO REDEFINE OUR

28:43.533 --> 28:46.767
CULTURE.

28:46.834 --> 28:48.367
EVEN IF WE CAN'T CHANGE THE

28:48.433 --> 28:50.066
PAST, MAYBE THEN WE WON'T HAVE

28:50.133 --> 28:54.633
TO REPEAT IT.
