BOULDER:

00:10.333 --> 00:12.250
We're gonna need a bigger road.

00:12.375 --> 00:15.166
Okay, that pedal's the gas,

00:12.375 --> 00:15.166
and that one's the brake.

00:15.291 --> 00:19.583
Thanks, Cody. I have two

00:15.291 --> 00:19.583
of my own, remember?

00:19.709 --> 00:21.750
What's that thing

00:19.709 --> 00:21.750
Kade's playing with?

00:21.875 --> 00:23.250
The GPS.

00:23.375 --> 00:26.125
Just planning my date

00:23.375 --> 00:26.125
with Hayley tomorrow.

00:26.250 --> 00:27.709
We'll start with a picnic.

00:27.834 --> 00:31.500
Nothing says romance

00:27.834 --> 00:31.500
like some hummus by the river...

00:31.625 --> 00:35.834
Fasten your seat belt, and

00:31.625 --> 00:35.834
you're ready to roll, Heatwave.

00:38.375 --> 00:40.250
Watch the sun go down

00:38.375 --> 00:40.250
over Mt. Griffin.

00:40.375 --> 00:41.667
We should probably

00:40.375 --> 00:41.667
bring a blanket.

00:41.792 --> 00:44.125
Hey, lover boy,

00:41.792 --> 00:44.125
can we begin now?

00:44.250 --> 00:46.208
Well, whenever you're--

00:44.250 --> 00:46.208
Whoa!

00:48.458 --> 00:51.500
Hard to believe this is

00:48.458 --> 00:51.500
Heatwave's first driving lesson.

00:51.625 --> 00:53.583
Kade must be

00:51.625 --> 00:53.583
a really good teacher.

00:55.250 --> 00:58.125
Aah! Slow down!

00:58.250 --> 01:01.000
Relax. I'm a vehicle

Anyone else in the area,

Presently, the game is

03:50.959 --> 03:53.041
programmed for only two players.

03:53.166 --> 03:54.834
Perhaps you should speak

03:53.166 --> 03:54.834
to Dr. Greene.

03:54.959 --> 03:57.083
He and Francine assisted us

03:54.959 --> 03:57.083

03:57.208 --> 03:59.417
to act like bucket-heads

03:59.542 --> 04:01.250
around those two anymore.

04:35.959 --> 04:39.458
his Cybertronian technology

04:35.959 --> 04:39.458

04:39.583 --> 04:43.834
In addition to all the updates

04:39.583 --> 04:43.834
to the firehouse, I've had...

04:43.959 --> 04:46.291
43 new inspirations.

04:46.417 --> 04:49.333
Forty-four, if you include

04:46.417 --> 04:49.333

04:49.458 --> 04:51.500
Tell him about the vacuum

04:49.458 --> 04:51.500
accelerator, Doc.

04:56.917 --> 05:00.166
to overcome spatial restraints.

05:00.291 --> 05:03.417
Uh...I was with you

05:00.291 --> 05:03.417
up until "small tube."

05:03.542 --> 05:05.041
I'll demonstrate.

05:09.625 --> 05:14.166
Hmm, we need

05:09.625 --> 05:14.166
a test subject. Ah!

( all giggle )

05:27.250 --> 05:29.542
Not stolen. Teleported.

05:29.667 --> 05:33.542
Noble! Can that teleporter

05:29.667 --> 05:33.542
move anything? Anywhere?

05:33.667 --> 05:35.125
Theoretically.

05:35.250 --> 05:36.542
Yeah, so where did it

05:35.250 --> 05:36.542
theoretically

05:36.667 --> 05:38.375
move my toolbox to, Doc?

05:38.500 --> 05:42.834
We don't know where the

05:38.500 --> 05:42.834
teleported objects go precisely.

05:42.959 --> 05:44.458
Uh, but we can

05:42.959 --> 05:44.458
bring them right back.

05:44.583 --> 05:47.250
( remote clicking )

05:48.834 --> 05:51.375
That is, we should be able to.

05:51.500 --> 05:54.166
The test object

05:51.500 --> 05:54.166
always returned before.

05:54.291 --> 05:56.667
Some new factor must have

05:54.291 --> 05:56.667
altered the mechanism.

05:56.792 --> 05:58.667
But what's changed?

05:58.792 --> 06:01.291

06:59.458 --> 07:01.709
I can buy Kade a new toolbox,

07:01.834 --> 07:08.583
but a new teleporter will be

07:01.834 --> 07:08.583
a bit harder to come by.

Nothing happened. Now what?

08:08.125 --> 08:10.083
We're on our way!

Perhaps my remote will

08:10.208 --> 08:13.000
do the trick once we're closer.

But I didn't know his name.

08:35.375 --> 08:37.041
Funny that you do.

08:37.166 --> 08:39.834
I pay attention

08:37.166 --> 08:39.834
to the other pilots.

08:39.959 --> 08:41.417
Name two others.

08:49.458 --> 08:51.041
So what am I supposed to do?

08:51.166 --> 08:53.917
Why does it always

08:51.166 --> 08:53.917
have to be about you?

( grunts )

08:55.542 --> 08:58.208
You're where?

08:55.542 --> 08:58.208
All right, stay put, son.

08:58.333 --> 09:00.375
Do not try to get out

08:58.333 --> 09:00.375
on your own.

09:00.500 --> 09:03.291
Somehow, Doc's device

09:00.500 --> 09:03.291
teleported Cody to the river.

09:03.417 --> 09:05.041
He said you could

09:03.417 --> 09:05.041
explain it, Boulder?

09:05.166 --> 09:08.291
Well, um, the small tube

09:05.166 --> 09:08.291
oscillates molecules

09:08.417 --> 09:10.500
on a subatomic level,

09:08.417 --> 09:10.500
and then it--

09:10.625 --> 09:13.375
Later. Vehicle mode, please.

09:13.500 --> 09:16.125
You too, Chase.

09:16.250 --> 09:17.709
Heatwave's staying

09:16.250 --> 09:17.709
with you, Kade.

09:17.834 --> 09:20.041
It's not like

09:17.834 --> 09:20.041
he's doing anything.

09:20.166 --> 09:24.041
( groans ):

09:20.166 --> 09:24.041
You do know we're

09:20.166 --> 09:24.041
on the same Com-Link, right?

09:24.166 --> 09:26.667
Fine. Heatwave, with me.

09:26.792 --> 09:28.375
Let's move, team.

09:30.125 --> 09:32.125
(  dramatic theme playing  )

09:35.917 --> 09:37.917
Kade, we'll fly you

09:35.917 --> 09:37.917
as close as we can.

09:38.041 --> 09:39.500
Be careful

09:38.041 --> 09:39.500
with this one, okay?

09:39.625 --> 09:41.166
KADE:

09:39.625 --> 09:41.166
Always am.

09:41.291 --> 09:45.709
Be extra careful.

09:41.291 --> 09:45.709
This one's name is Taylor!

09:45.834 --> 09:47.542
Blades, I'm never oiling

09:45.834 --> 09:47.542
your gearbox again.

09:47.667 --> 09:48.875
( gasps )

09:56.041 --> 09:58.500
( grunting )

09:58.625 --> 10:01.041
Aah!

10:01.166 --> 10:02.500
( both grunting )

10:02.625 --> 10:04.250
Hold on!

10:04.375 --> 10:06.959
( gasps ):

10:04.375 --> 10:06.959
Kade? Kade, can you hear me?

10:07.083 --> 10:09.041
Hi. Taylor, right?

10:09.166 --> 10:13.542
Can I be honest? This is

10:09.166 --> 10:13.542
kind of a goofy sport.

10:13.667 --> 10:15.625
(  dramatic theme playing  )

10:20.208 --> 10:22.166
Wh-- Where did they go?

10:31.000 --> 10:33.792
( gasping ):

10:31.000 --> 10:33.792
You know, next time

10:31.000 --> 10:33.792
you try this goofy sport,

10:33.917 --> 10:35.625
I'll teach you

10:33.917 --> 10:35.625
how to land properly.

10:35.750 --> 10:38.208
Well, next time, don't run

10:35.750 --> 10:38.208
into a lighthouse,

10:38.333 --> 10:40.000
and I won't need

10:38.333 --> 10:40.000
to land.

10:40.125 --> 10:41.917
Ah! Aah!

10:42.041 --> 10:43.875
Ah, looks like

10:42.041 --> 10:43.875
you sprained your ankle.

10:44.000 --> 10:46.166
Better stay off it until

10:44.000 --> 10:46.166
we can call for a ride.

10:46.291 --> 10:47.959
What, do you think

10:46.291 --> 10:47.959
you're some kind of doctor?

10:48.083 --> 10:49.917
EMT training on the mainland.

10:50.041 --> 10:55.000
( snorts ):

10:50.041 --> 10:55.000
Yeah. Uh, hey,

10:50.041 --> 10:55.000
where's my Com-Link?

10:56.709 --> 10:59.250
( animal panting )

10:59.375 --> 11:01.875
( growling )

11:02.000 --> 11:05.166
On second thought, maybe you

11:02.000 --> 11:05.166
should try walkin' after all.

11:05.291 --> 11:07.333
I don't need any help. Aah!

11:07.458 --> 11:10.208
(  dramatic theme playing  )

11:10.333 --> 11:13.875
Oh, the teleporter still isn't

11:10.333 --> 11:13.875
responding to the remote, Dad.

11:14.000 --> 11:17.458
There must be a more powerful

11:14.000 --> 11:17.458
signal overriding ours.

11:17.583 --> 11:19.667
We need to give

11:17.583 --> 11:19.667
the remote a boost.

11:19.792 --> 11:22.750
Won't be necessary, Doc.

11:19.792 --> 11:22.750
We can boost the whole MHQ.

11:32.083 --> 11:34.583
Cody, are you all right?

11:34.709 --> 11:38.542
Yeah, but I'm kinda wishing

11:34.709 --> 11:38.542
I brought a bathing suit.

11:38.667 --> 11:40.834
DANI:

11:38.667 --> 11:40.834
Dad, are you there? It's Kade.

11:40.959 --> 11:42.834
He's lost in the mountains

11:40.959 --> 11:42.834
somewhere with Taylor.

11:42.959 --> 11:48.125
So, Hot Shot couldn't handle

11:42.959 --> 11:48.125
things by himself, huh?

11:48.250 --> 11:50.333
The parasail flew off

11:48.250 --> 11:50.333
with them holding on to it.

11:50.458 --> 11:52.125
We're searching, but--

11:52.250 --> 11:54.583
Even if we found them, the trees

11:52.250 --> 11:54.583
are too dense for me to land.

11:54.709 --> 11:56.750
As soon as Cody's safe,

11:54.709 --> 11:56.750
we'll meet you at the end

11:56.875 --> 11:58.875
of the Old Canyon Road

11:56.875 --> 11:58.875
to initiate a ground search.

11:59.000 --> 12:01.375
( grunting )

12:01.500 --> 12:03.542
Cody! Hang onto something!

12:03.667 --> 12:05.583
( grunting )

12:05.709 --> 12:07.667
(  dramatic theme playing  )

12:09.667 --> 12:10.917
Aah!

12:15.166 --> 12:17.041
Climb out toward me, Cody!

12:17.166 --> 12:18.375
Ugh!

12:22.875 --> 12:24.041
CHIEF:

12:22.875 --> 12:24.041
What?

12:24.166 --> 12:25.750
FRANKIE: Cody!

12:24.166 --> 12:25.750
DOC GREENE: Boiling chips!

12:25.875 --> 12:27.959
Where did the MHQ go?

12:31.458 --> 12:33.375
( grunts )

12:33.500 --> 12:34.875
Aah!

12:35.000 --> 12:36.291
Ugh!

12:36.417 --> 12:39.208
Aah! Ugh!

12:39.333 --> 12:40.542
Not good!

12:45.250 --> 12:48.291
( grunting )

12:48.417 --> 12:51.291
There are times when I wish

12:48.417 --> 12:51.291
gravity were not a law.

12:51.417 --> 12:55.875
( grunting )

12:56.000 --> 12:57.917
Aah!

13:02.083 --> 13:04.166
I know I said I missed

13:02.083 --> 13:04.166
hanging out with you guys,

13:04.291 --> 13:06.583
but this is not

13:04.291 --> 13:06.583
what I had in mind.

13:06.709 --> 13:10.917
On the plus side, I bet hardly

13:06.709 --> 13:10.917
anyone gets a view like this.

13:11.041 --> 13:13.917
Yeah, there's a reason

13:11.041 --> 13:13.917
for that.

13:14.041 --> 13:18.542
May Day! SOS! This is

13:14.041 --> 13:18.542
not a test! Mommy!

13:18.667 --> 13:20.709
Those are all the human

13:18.667 --> 13:20.709
distress signals I know.

13:20.834 --> 13:22.208
Chase, where are you?

13:22.333 --> 13:24.625
CHASE:

13:22.333 --> 13:24.625
We find ourselves

13:22.333 --> 13:24.625
in a precarious position

13:24.750 --> 13:25.875
atop Mt. Griffin.

13:26.000 --> 13:29.333
And he means the very top, Dad!

13:30.792 --> 13:32.166
We see you, Cody.

13:38.834 --> 13:42.834
There is no way this is gonna--

13:38.834 --> 13:42.834
work!

13:42.959 --> 13:44.583
( bear growling )

13:44.709 --> 13:46.583
(  dramatic theme playing  )

13:46.709 --> 13:48.667
( grunting )

13:53.208 --> 13:55.834
We're better off up here

13:53.208 --> 13:55.834
than trying to outrun a bear.

13:55.959 --> 13:57.542
I'd only have to outrun you.

13:57.667 --> 13:59.375
Look, I know

13:57.667 --> 13:59.375
you rescued me and all,

13:59.500 --> 14:02.041
but can you try being

13:59.500 --> 14:02.041
a little bit friendly?

14:02.166 --> 14:05.500
Sorry. I guess my sister got

14:02.166 --> 14:05.500
all the charm in the family.

14:05.625 --> 14:07.166
Yeah, all the looks too.

14:07.291 --> 14:09.667
Ha. Huh?

14:09.792 --> 14:11.792
( growling )

14:18.792 --> 14:20.875
( grunting )

14:27.417 --> 14:29.917
Kade's not gonna

14:27.417 --> 14:29.917
like that.

14:30.041 --> 14:34.083
Blades! You're a sight

14:30.041 --> 14:34.083
for sore optics.

14:34.208 --> 14:36.333
(  dramatic theme playing  )

14:44.041 --> 14:47.208
( both grunting )

14:47.333 --> 14:51.417
Ugh! Let's hope I have enough

14:47.333 --> 14:51.417
oomph to get you out of here!

14:52.792 --> 14:54.583
CODY:

14:52.792 --> 14:54.583
The teleporter!

14:56.875 --> 14:58.542
Unh!

15:11.750 --> 15:15.333
Blades! We're falling

15:11.750 --> 15:15.333
too fast. Slow down.

15:15.458 --> 15:19.291
( grunting ):

15:15.458 --> 15:19.291
I never thought

15:15.458 --> 15:19.291
I'd hear you say that.

15:26.667 --> 15:29.917
Unh. What is this thing,

15:26.667 --> 15:29.917
anyway?

15:30.041 --> 15:31.959
A small tube that...

15:32.083 --> 15:33.709
(  dramatic theme playing  )

15:42.291 --> 15:43.792
Well, that was fun.

15:47.166 --> 15:49.208
Much better.

15:49.333 --> 15:53.834
( sighs ):

15:49.333 --> 15:53.834
This mobile headquarters

15:49.333 --> 15:53.834
is way too mobile.

15:55.208 --> 15:57.000
Cody!

15:57.125 --> 15:59.333
Oh, Cody.

15:59.458 --> 16:03.083
Ugh! This thing is

15:59.458 --> 16:03.083
nothin' but trouble!

16:03.208 --> 16:04.709
( grunts )

16:06.750 --> 16:10.667
Hey! Doc and I put

16:06.750 --> 16:10.667
a lot of thought into that!

16:10.792 --> 16:13.291
Apparently, not enough.

16:15.250 --> 16:18.709
No more sightseeing.

16:15.250 --> 16:18.709
We're going to find Kade.

16:18.834 --> 16:22.709
You mean drive there?

16:18.834 --> 16:22.709
In this? No way.

16:22.834 --> 16:24.750
Kade and Taylor are

16:22.834 --> 16:24.750
in a forest so dense,

16:24.875 --> 16:28.000
you couldn't get through,

16:24.875 --> 16:28.000
let alone this monster.

16:28.125 --> 16:29.291
Ugh.

16:29.417 --> 16:31.250
Too bad we can't

16:29.417 --> 16:31.250
teleport there.

16:31.375 --> 16:33.250
Even if we knew where Kade was,

16:33.375 --> 16:36.125
there's no way to control

16:33.375 --> 16:36.125
where the teleporter takes us.

16:36.250 --> 16:37.500
The river, the mountain...

16:37.625 --> 16:39.542
And then, oddly,

16:37.625 --> 16:39.542
an outdoor cinema.

16:39.667 --> 16:42.709
The device's range of

16:39.667 --> 16:42.709
destinations does seem random.

16:42.834 --> 16:45.333
Wait, it's not random.

16:45.458 --> 16:49.125
Cody, can you call up

16:45.458 --> 16:49.125
the MHQ's GPS from back here?

16:49.250 --> 16:50.709
Sure.

16:52.625 --> 16:54.875
(  whimsical theme playing  )

17:00.250 --> 17:03.792
Those are all the places Kade

17:00.250 --> 17:03.792
was talking about taking Hayley.

17:03.917 --> 17:06.041
He programmed them in here

17:03.917 --> 17:06.041
to plan his route.

17:06.166 --> 17:07.792
BLADES:

17:06.166 --> 17:07.792
That's amazing!

17:07.917 --> 17:10.208
You actually pay

17:07.917 --> 17:10.208
attention to Kade.

17:10.333 --> 17:11.709
Don't you dare tell him.

17:11.834 --> 17:13.834
When the Command Center

17:11.834 --> 17:13.834
went online,

17:13.959 --> 17:15.959
it took over

17:13.959 --> 17:15.959
the teleporter's controls.

17:16.083 --> 17:18.875
So if we are able to determine

17:16.083 --> 17:18.875
Kade's current coordinates--

17:19.000 --> 17:21.834
And Taylor's...

17:21.959 --> 17:23.500
( both giggle )

17:23.625 --> 17:25.291
We should be able

17:23.625 --> 17:25.291
to program them

17:25.417 --> 17:27.417
into the GPS

17:25.417 --> 17:27.417
and teleport there!

17:27.542 --> 17:30.375
Except...

17:30.500 --> 17:32.917
Uh-huh. Yeah...

17:33.041 --> 17:34.959
(  slow dramatic theme playing  )

17:38.875 --> 17:41.291
How far did you

17:38.875 --> 17:41.291
throw that thing?

17:41.417 --> 17:43.583
Nobody complained

17:41.417 --> 17:43.583
when I was lobbing champ

17:43.709 --> 17:45.333
three years running.

17:50.375 --> 17:52.875
CODY:

17:50.375 --> 17:52.875
Dad!

17:53.000 --> 17:55.750
We were halfway up Mt. Griffin

17:53.000 --> 17:55.750
when we got your call.

17:55.875 --> 17:58.291
( sighs ):

17:55.875 --> 17:58.291
It's hard keepin' up

17:55.875 --> 17:58.291
with all of you.

17:58.417 --> 18:01.208
And the strangest thing happened

17:58.417 --> 18:01.208
on the way here.

18:01.333 --> 18:05.583
This hit my windshield.

18:01.333 --> 18:05.583
It must have teleported itself!

18:05.709 --> 18:07.667
Um...sort of.

18:09.959 --> 18:11.583
I'll explain later.

18:14.250 --> 18:17.417
Did you ever have the feeling

18:14.250 --> 18:17.417
you were a few steps behind?

18:17.542 --> 18:20.959
More like a whole staircase.

18:21.083 --> 18:23.000
( roaring )

18:23.125 --> 18:25.959
(  dramatic theme playing  )

18:26.125 --> 18:28.667
I think that's Bear

18:26.125 --> 18:28.667
for "you are lunch."

18:32.583 --> 18:35.542
Yeah? Then let's send him

18:32.583 --> 18:35.542
to another restaurant.

18:35.667 --> 18:36.875
( grunts )

18:39.458 --> 18:42.166
( panting )

18:42.291 --> 18:45.542
Not bad! Maybe my sister

18:42.291 --> 18:45.542
was right about you.

18:45.667 --> 18:48.333
Dani? She knows who I am?

18:45.667 --> 18:48.333
What did she say?

18:48.458 --> 18:52.750
DANI:

18:48.458 --> 18:52.750
Kade. Kade, come in.

18:52.875 --> 18:54.834
( roars )

18:56.750 --> 18:59.458
Kade. Kade, come in.

18:59.959 --> 19:01.375
He's still not

18:59.959 --> 19:01.375
answering.

19:01.542 --> 19:04.000
That doesn't mean the Com-Link

19:01.542 --> 19:04.000
isn't putting out a signal.

19:04.125 --> 19:06.291
(  dramatic theme playing  )

19:06.417 --> 19:09.458
( beeping )

19:09.583 --> 19:11.083
Found it. Heatwave?

19:11.208 --> 19:13.792
I'm entering Kade's

19:11.208 --> 19:13.792
coordinates into the GPS.

19:13.917 --> 19:16.458
Strap in.

19:25.458 --> 19:29.208
But how do we determine

19:25.458 --> 19:29.208
precisely when we're going to--

19:32.709 --> 19:34.333
( roaring )

19:34.458 --> 19:36.166
(  dramatic theme playing  )

19:48.792 --> 19:50.625
( horn honks )

19:50.750 --> 19:52.709
( roars )

19:55.208 --> 19:57.208
( engine sputters )

19:59.709 --> 20:01.250
Come on.

20:12.750 --> 20:14.750
( growling )

20:15.875 --> 20:18.166
Rah!

20:20.375 --> 20:21.625
( whimpering )

20:32.000 --> 20:34.500
Oh, thank goodness

20:32.000 --> 20:34.500
you're not hurt.

20:38.291 --> 20:40.291
Uh...check out the foot.

20:40.834 --> 20:44.000
Oh, I meant--

20:40.834 --> 20:44.000
I-- I mean, uh...

20:45.083 --> 20:47.917
Oh. So ask her out already!

20:48.667 --> 20:51.500
( giggles, sighs )

20:51.625 --> 20:53.583
(  dramatic theme playing  )

20:59.166 --> 21:02.333
Somehow, a family always ends up

20:59.166 --> 21:02.333
back together, doesn't it?

21:02.458 --> 21:04.667
Take us home, son.

21:08.792 --> 21:09.792
Ready, everybody?

21:09.959 --> 21:11.625
Ready.

21:09.959 --> 21:11.625
Affirmative.

21:11.750 --> 21:13.250
Ready.

21:11.750 --> 21:13.250
Let's go.

21:13.375 --> 21:14.917
Let's do it.

21:13.375 --> 21:14.917
Yep.

21:15.041 --> 21:18.834
I just had another

21:15.041 --> 21:18.834
inspiration! That makes 45!

21:18.959 --> 21:22.417
Heh. I'm not sure you should

21:18.959 --> 21:22.417
count the teleporter, Daddy.

21:22.542 --> 21:24.125
Yeah, it's still

21:22.542 --> 21:24.125
a little--

21:29.709 --> 21:31.959
--unpredictable.

21:33.083 --> 21:35.291
