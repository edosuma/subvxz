00:14.454 --> 00:18.784
There's a link between Stanton and the
mercenaries that shot down Bauer's plane.

00:18.875 --> 00:20.830
Stanton won't be easy to break.

00:20.930 --> 00:24.711
You may need to expand the
limits of how far you'll go.

00:24.798 --> 00:28.297
Mr Stanton, by order of the president,
I'm placing you under arrest.

00:28.385 --> 00:31.968
This falls outside
the parameters of your charge.

00:32.055 --> 00:35.222
What would you like me to do, sir?

00:35.308 --> 00:38.724
I don't know
what you're talking about.

00:40.772 --> 00:43.975
- Where is she now?
- She ran off after the accident.

00:44.067 --> 00:48.895
Maybe she was trying to avoid the local
police or trying not to get brought back to LA.

00:48.989 --> 00:51.231
Just find her, George.

00:52.367 --> 00:54.443
Ow!

00:55.996 --> 00:59.329
Marie, we have a problem.
Basheer and Marko are dead.

00:59.416 --> 01:02.619
- What do you need me to do?
- They were gonna pick up the trigger.

01:02.711 --> 01:06.246
- Where is it?
- The place Marko worked. In his locker.

01:06.339 --> 01:10.503
You must gain access to this locker
and bring the trigger to Omar.

01:10.594 --> 01:11.673
I'll take care of it.

01:11.762 --> 01:14.431
I've earned the right to know
what's going on.

01:14.514 --> 01:17.714
Syed Ali is at the centre
of a terrorist attack.

01:17.814 --> 01:20.220
We need you to identify him for us.

01:20.312 --> 01:22.719
He's in there. Syed Ali. He's in there.

01:24.691 --> 01:26.020
Damm it!

01:26.109 --> 01:27.901
He's dead, Jack.

01:27.986 --> 01:30.062
These clothes don't belong to this man.

01:30.155 --> 01:34.733
Maintain secure exits.
Ali is still in the building.

01:59.559 --> 02:02.430
Step outside until
we get the situation resolved.

02:02.521 --> 02:06.518
- Agent Bauer told me to stay. Talk to him.
- As soon as you step outside.

02:06.608 --> 02:11.317
She stays with us. She's gotta make
the final identification on Ali.

02:11.404 --> 02:14.939
This was in the pocket
of the man Ali set on fire.

02:15.033 --> 02:20.075
- It might be a document Ali was carrying.
- Photo it, send it to CTU.

02:20.163 --> 02:22.535
Are you trying to protect this man?

02:22.624 --> 02:25.293
No, I have no misplaced loyalties.

02:25.377 --> 02:30.454
If the man has murdered an innocent, he is as
guilty in the eyes of Islam as he is in yours.

02:30.549 --> 02:33.503
The man that I'm looking for
set in motion a plan today

02:33.593 --> 02:37.128
to detonate a nuclear weapon
in Los Angeles.

02:38.432 --> 02:41.136
- Are you certain?
- Yes, we're certain.

02:41.226 --> 02:45.271
We estimate between one and two million
people will die if this bomb goes off.

02:45.355 --> 02:49.602
That, sir, is why we need to find him now.

02:49.693 --> 02:55.980
Thank you for informing me, but I can be
no more honest with you than I have been.

02:56.074 --> 03:00.154
But if you find this man, perhaps
I can talk to him in a way you cannot.

03:01.204 --> 03:03.244
Persuade him.

03:03.331 --> 03:05.407
Agent Bauer?

03:08.587 --> 03:10.912
Thank you.

03:13.341 --> 03:16.259
We found something I think you should see.

03:21.516 --> 03:26.178
We found this trap door. It's not on
any of the schematics you gave us.

03:30.984 --> 03:33.653
Open it.

03:37.699 --> 03:42.278
- I go down... I'm going down alone.
- I know this is your operation...

03:42.370 --> 03:47.079
Listen to me. We just lost one of Ali's men
to a cyanide capsule hidden in his tooth.

03:47.167 --> 03:50.013
We have to assume Ali's willing
to take his life the same way.

03:50.137 --> 03:53.039
He can't see us coming.

03:53.131 --> 03:57.461
Have your men assemble at the base
of the ladder. Await my instructions.

03:57.552 --> 04:02.926
Have you got your baton with you?
Let me have it. OK.

04:33.463 --> 04:34.744
- Hello?
- Marie.

04:34.840 --> 04:39.133
- There has been a change of plans.
- Why? What's going on?

04:39.219 --> 04:41.093
Just go to the rendezvous point.

04:41.179 --> 04:45.307
If I'm not there within one half-hour
of the time we have planned,

04:45.392 --> 04:48.262
then you know what to do.

04:48.353 --> 04:51.603
- You remember what I said, yes?
- I remember.

05:11.251 --> 05:15.877
I've got the suspect!
Engage the room! Engage the room!

05:17.632 --> 05:19.708
Get his legs!

05:21.386 --> 05:26.629
- That's him! That is Syed Ali!
- Get her outta here! Get her outta here!

05:26.725 --> 05:29.263
Get her outta here!

05:39.279 --> 05:42.399
I got the cyanide. Get him ready.

05:45.118 --> 05:47.740
Baker!

05:47.829 --> 05:50.830
Find out who he was talking to.

05:55.837 --> 05:59.965
It's hard not to sit here and think
that there must be some mistake,

06:00.050 --> 06:03.086
even with the evidence you have.

06:04.179 --> 06:10.431
It's black-and-white, Bob. Your daughter
killed Reza and two of our agents.

06:10.519 --> 06:14.848
And I need you to help us understand
what her connection to Syed Ali is.

06:14.940 --> 06:18.688
If I'd known she was involved,
I would have done something.

06:18.777 --> 06:24.815
And now that you do know,
does it help explain any strange behaviour?

06:26.284 --> 06:29.285
Anything you can tell us will help.

06:29.371 --> 06:31.447
Well...

06:32.624 --> 06:38.876
Marie went to college in London
while I was working there.

06:38.964 --> 06:44.919
That's when her mother died,
and it hit her hard, hit us all hard.

06:46.513 --> 06:47.888
And?

06:48.765 --> 06:51.600
She ran away for a while.

06:51.685 --> 06:53.927
How long?

06:55.397 --> 06:58.896
Three, maybe four weeks.

07:00.235 --> 07:03.770
We got the police involved, but...

07:03.864 --> 07:07.233
she sent us a letter saying
that she was fine,

07:07.325 --> 07:13.577
that she was travelling
and she just needed some space.

07:14.833 --> 07:17.158
And when she came back...

07:18.587 --> 07:25.585
I was so grateful to see her
that I stopped asking questions.

07:27.095 --> 07:31.307
No sense that anything had changed?

07:31.391 --> 07:34.392
Any fundamental difference?

07:35.479 --> 07:40.473
She had become less politically inclined.

07:40.567 --> 07:45.644
Marie had always flirted with causes,
respectable causes.

07:45.739 --> 07:49.783
Like save the wilderness
or abolish the death penalty.

07:50.660 --> 07:54.575
She stopped talking about all that.

07:54.664 --> 07:58.116
That's precisely what happens
when you're radicalised.

07:58.210 --> 08:03.251
Handlers train you to stop talking
about anything, keep it to yourself,

08:03.340 --> 08:06.958
so you're better able to blend in
with the background.

08:07.052 --> 08:09.590
Marie had handlers?

08:11.264 --> 08:15.677
Hey, can it wait?
I'll be right back with this.

08:21.983 --> 08:26.978
This scan came in from the mosque. A burnt
paper fragment found in Ali's clothing.

08:27.072 --> 08:30.156
The only thing visible
is in the lower left quadrant.

08:30.242 --> 08:33.361
It looks like a piece of a number.
A six or an eight.

08:33.453 --> 08:35.909
Are all our forensics
people out in the field?

08:35.996 --> 08:40.244
We got Murdoch on loan from San Diego.
He's an expert with computer imaging.

08:40.335 --> 08:43.371
If anyone can see this, he can.

08:44.005 --> 08:47.671
- How are you doing? George Mason.
- Hey, man. Randy Murdoch.

08:47.759 --> 08:50.333
- Pleased to meet you.
- Good to meet you.

08:52.305 --> 08:56.517
- Any way to accelerate the process?
- My CPU's faster than anything you got.

08:56.601 --> 09:02.307
Parallel processing could take too long
to set up. If there's anything there, I'll get it.

09:02.399 --> 09:05.353
Great. Where's Tony
and the satellite feed Jack wants?

09:05.444 --> 09:06.772
In progress.

09:06.862 --> 09:09.613
- Thank you. Keep it up.
- All right.

09:29.217 --> 09:33.345
- Who else knew about the bomb?
- I don't know what you're talking about.

09:33.430 --> 09:36.182
Jack Bauer is interrogating Ali as we speak.

09:36.266 --> 09:40.762
We'll be informed of his progress on
a minute-by-minute basis, but nothing yet.

09:40.854 --> 09:43.392
We're certain he knows
the location of the bomb?

09:43.482 --> 09:44.732
Jack Bauer is.

09:44.932 --> 09:46.648
Make sure he has all
the resources he needs.

09:46.735 --> 09:47.933
Yes, sir.

09:48.028 --> 09:51.231
The pain's only going to get
much, much worse.

09:55.744 --> 09:56.906
You can stop it.

09:56.995 --> 09:59.486
Agent Simmons tells me that Roger

09:59.581 --> 10:03.709
received the same training
of resisting interrogation he did.

10:03.794 --> 10:08.621
- I'm increasing the voltage.
- But everyone breaks eventually.

10:21.996 --> 10:23.823
You have an entry point?

10:23.915 --> 10:28.079
She entered the forest somewhere
between 8-3 and 8-4 on the topo map.

10:28.169 --> 10:31.455
- And heading?
- No. No idea which way she was headed.

10:31.548 --> 10:33.624
- Keep me posted.
- What are you doing?

10:33.717 --> 10:38.425
- Getting more men looking for Kim.
- I told you to divert resources to the bomb.

10:38.513 --> 10:42.641
The satellite feed is happening.
I was telling the sheriff to look for her.

10:42.726 --> 10:45.596
You're a resource.
Don't split your attention.

10:45.687 --> 10:49.637
I promised Jack I'd do everything I could
to look for Kim. Just like you did.

10:49.733 --> 10:53.315
Kim is outside the blast radius.
The rest of Los Angeles isn't.

10:53.403 --> 10:58.065
Stay focused on the bomb, Tony!
That goes for everybody!

11:04.164 --> 11:08.078
- LA County Ranger Station.
- This is Tony Almeida at CTU.

11:08.168 --> 11:11.501
I'm trying to track somebody
who went into the forest.

11:11.588 --> 11:13.664
Hold while I transfer you.

12:11.106 --> 12:14.521
Hey, somebody there?

12:15.318 --> 12:16.516
Hello?

12:19.698 --> 12:24.609
- Who are you? What are you doing here?
- Me? What are you doing here?

12:26.996 --> 12:30.163
I got into a car accident.

12:30.250 --> 12:35.754
I started running, and before I knew it,
I was out here. I had no idea where I was.

12:35.839 --> 12:39.587
I got stuck in this stupid thing.

12:39.676 --> 12:44.254
Look, all I wanna do is get back
to the highway and get outta here.

12:45.515 --> 12:48.884
Why were you running
from the highway in the first place?

12:48.977 --> 12:52.180
I told you, I was scared and panicked.

12:53.106 --> 12:54.386
Damm it.

13:15.670 --> 13:18.457
Oh, God. Thank you.

13:35.023 --> 13:37.181
Coming through here.

13:40.403 --> 13:44.021
We're moving into position now. Baker out.

13:52.374 --> 13:56.205
I know who you are.
I know everything that you've done.

13:56.294 --> 13:59.212
Where is the bomb?

14:03.593 --> 14:05.918
Where's the bomb?!

14:09.349 --> 14:12.433
You are wasting my time.

14:14.854 --> 14:17.180
When is the bomb gonna detonate?

14:17.273 --> 14:19.978
You're the one wasting time.

14:21.861 --> 14:24.779
I woke up today knowing I will die.

14:25.824 --> 14:31.031
I can make you die with more pain
than you ever imagined.

14:35.792 --> 14:39.624
Then I will have that much
more pleasure in paradise.

14:39.713 --> 14:41.789
Right.

14:44.843 --> 14:48.543
We gotta figure out how to get you
to the nearest ranger station.

14:48.638 --> 14:52.470
No, that's OK. I don't wanna go back there.

14:53.768 --> 14:57.303
The same reason you ran from the highway?

15:06.031 --> 15:08.486
Here, I got it. Thank you.

15:12.954 --> 15:16.572
The highway is a couple of miles that way.

15:17.751 --> 15:24.252
But the terrain's too rough to follow at night,
and there's cougars up in that area.

15:25.884 --> 15:29.549
My place is a half-mile that way.

15:29.637 --> 15:33.587
I could put a roof
over your head for the night.

15:57.207 --> 15:59.911
I am the imam of this mosque.

16:04.089 --> 16:06.377
Do you deny these men's accusations

16:06.466 --> 16:12.800
that you are planning to explode a bomb
that will kill millions of people?

16:14.891 --> 16:19.103
The Koran clearly forbids the killing
of innocents and non-combatants.

16:19.187 --> 16:22.104
You know this as well as I do.

16:22.190 --> 16:25.191
We have different interpretations
of the Koran.

16:25.276 --> 16:28.313
You are misguided.

16:29.322 --> 16:32.857
Someone has twisted
the words of the prophet.

16:32.951 --> 16:35.738
Allah does not love aggressors.

16:36.788 --> 16:42.791
Listen to me. The murder of one innocent, let
alone millions, will not get you into paradise.

16:42.877 --> 16:47.753
We will continue this debate
when I see you there, Imam Al Fulani.

16:56.725 --> 17:01.885
I want the images from this computer
transferred to these monitors.

17:01.980 --> 17:05.763
I have talked to men who misuse
our religion to channel their hate,

17:05.858 --> 17:09.108
but I have not known anyone
who would act on their impulses.

17:09.194 --> 17:11.982
Can you make an appeal
that'll make any difference?

17:12.073 --> 17:16.616
- I will try again, but I don't think so.
- We don't have that kind of time.

17:16.703 --> 17:19.656
Please, I want to try again.

17:19.748 --> 17:22.832
You can't be involved
with what's gonna happen next.

17:22.916 --> 17:25.205
Please escort the gentleman upstairs.

17:25.670 --> 17:28.422
- Agent Bauer?
- Yeah.

17:30.341 --> 17:35.632
We recovered the last number Ali dialled
on his cell. It's a 310 area code. 555-2130.

17:35.722 --> 17:38.723
- We're doing a work-up on it now.
- OK, good.

17:38.808 --> 17:42.177
Wait. What was that number?

17:46.691 --> 17:49.313
555-2130.

17:53.239 --> 17:58.151
No, that's not possible.
That's my sister's cellphone number.

18:02.415 --> 18:07.872
What's going on?
What are you not telling me?

18:07.962 --> 18:10.418
Why don't you give us a minute?

18:15.553 --> 18:18.839
Reza and two of our agents
were found shot to death

18:18.932 --> 18:22.976
in your father's building
about an hour and a half ago.

18:23.061 --> 18:26.430
- What?
- Your sister Marie was with them.

18:26.523 --> 18:31.101
- Marie? Is she OK?
- They don't know where she is right now.

18:32.404 --> 18:34.480
When were you going to tell me?

18:34.572 --> 18:38.617
When we had confirmation that
she was the person that pulled the trigger.

18:38.702 --> 18:43.198
What? That is ridiculous.
How could you even think that?

18:43.289 --> 18:46.077
Because we have video tape on her.

18:46.167 --> 18:52.585
She was the only person seen leaving your
father's building in the last hour and a half.

18:52.674 --> 18:57.502
She was probably trying to escape.
She could have been hurt.

18:58.388 --> 19:02.006
You don't know if she picked up.
The phone could have been stolen!

19:02.100 --> 19:05.800
You really believe your sister
has nothing to do with this?

19:05.895 --> 19:08.184
Yes, I really believe it.

19:08.273 --> 19:12.401
There's one way you could prove
that to me. Phone her cellphone.

19:12.485 --> 19:16.186
But if she picks up, you have to keep her
on the phone so we can find her.

19:16.281 --> 19:19.566
That's the deal. Can you do that?

19:19.659 --> 19:22.233
OK.

19:25.165 --> 19:27.241
OK.

19:28.251 --> 19:30.493
OK.

19:30.587 --> 19:32.912
I'm gonna be right back.

19:34.841 --> 19:36.252
Baker?

19:38.553 --> 19:42.136
We need to trace a cellphone call.
But manipulate the caller ID.

19:42.223 --> 19:48.973
We need to make it look like it's coming
from Kate Warner's phone. Get on it now.

20:07.808 --> 20:11.853
Our equipment will make it look like
you're calling from your cellphone.

20:11.937 --> 20:15.353
Tell her you're worried
cos you haven't heard from her.

20:15.441 --> 20:18.561
We're linked into the cell-provider network.

20:18.652 --> 20:21.404
Once we lock, we can track the phone.

20:21.489 --> 20:24.359
OK, good. Let's make the call.

20:25.326 --> 20:27.947
What if it's not her?
What if it's someone else?

20:28.037 --> 20:30.742
That's what we need to find out.

20:31.582 --> 20:35.876
Finding your sister right now
could save the lives of millions of people.

20:35.961 --> 20:37.871
Please make the call.

20:59.109 --> 21:01.186
Hello?

21:02.154 --> 21:04.230
Hi.

21:04.949 --> 21:07.784
It's me.

21:07.868 --> 21:11.569
I haven't been able to reach Dad.
He's not back yet.

21:11.664 --> 21:14.665
What's going on?

21:14.750 --> 21:19.127
Just taking a drive... to clear my head.

21:21.757 --> 21:23.999
I can understand.

21:25.803 --> 21:29.338
I'm so sorry, Marie, about everything.

21:29.431 --> 21:31.508
Yes.

21:35.563 --> 21:40.189
Do you want to meet
back at the house? Grab a bite?

21:41.819 --> 21:43.895
Can you?

21:44.905 --> 21:50.492
They've found Reza, haven't they?
They know what's happened.

21:50.578 --> 21:55.619
I don't know. I don't know what happened.

21:55.708 --> 21:57.166
Oh, Marie.

21:58.127 --> 22:01.044
Tell me, please, what happened?

22:01.881 --> 22:04.550
You wouldn't understand, Kate.

22:06.260 --> 22:11.764
You killed Reza? And those agents?

22:11.849 --> 22:15.099
People have to die for things to change.

22:15.186 --> 22:17.309
We're locked.

22:19.148 --> 22:22.746
You couldn't have done this.
You're not this person.

22:22.946 --> 22:25.103
They forced you.
You didn't know what you were doing.

22:31.535 --> 22:34.322
We tracked it to a
ten-block section of Sylmar.

22:34.413 --> 22:37.118
Tell CHP to shut down that ten-block radius.

22:37.208 --> 22:38.785
Send vitals on Marie Warner.

22:38.876 --> 22:41.663
- Tell them to find her.
- Got it.

22:41.754 --> 22:44.671
You don't know who she was with!

22:44.757 --> 22:48.801
They could have been forcing her.
You don't know!

22:53.224 --> 22:57.553
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

23:09.073 --> 23:14.494
- Any word back from the ranger station?
- Nothing yet. They mounted a search.

23:14.578 --> 23:18.576
Tony. I just sent this to Jack
over at the mosque. Check it out.

23:18.666 --> 23:21.583
This paper has a very
irregular pulp pattern.

23:21.669 --> 23:25.583
The final step in the process
is to take samples from various points,

23:25.673 --> 23:28.876
to create a CGI algorithm
of what the paper looked like

23:28.968 --> 23:32.467
without any of the writings
or other impressions on it.

23:32.555 --> 23:37.098
We then subtract that from what
we've actually got, and what we get...

23:39.812 --> 23:45.316
is a representation of anything
that interrupts that pattern.

23:48.028 --> 23:52.192
There it is. OK. This is only a partial.

23:52.283 --> 23:57.110
There are a few more markings.
Letters or numbers to the right of these.

23:57.204 --> 23:59.493
But I need time. They're more obscure.

23:59.582 --> 24:04.042
Do we have any contacts whatsoever as to
what these numbers and letters refer to?

24:04.128 --> 24:10.213
They photographed the paper on both sides.
That's the only area with any information.

24:10.301 --> 24:11.795
All right. Good job.

24:11.886 --> 24:16.097
Michelle, get anyone we can spare
on that sequence of letters and numbers.

24:16.182 --> 24:18.637
Check VIN numbers, license plates.

24:18.726 --> 24:21.561
Also get crypto to see if that's a code.

24:21.645 --> 24:23.721
I'm on it.

24:27.359 --> 24:29.435
- Agent Bauer?
- Yeah.

24:31.405 --> 24:33.896
This just came in from CTU.

24:37.536 --> 24:40.206
Open the door. Open the door!

24:41.207 --> 24:44.576
N34, what does that mean?

24:44.668 --> 24:46.744
What does that mean?

24:48.839 --> 24:50.796
You screwed up, Ali.

24:50.883 --> 24:54.216
We're gonna cross-reference
that number in our database.

24:54.303 --> 24:57.921
Marie Warner is being picked up as we speak.

24:58.015 --> 25:02.760
The pieces are starting to come together.
No matter what, we'll find this bomb.

25:02.853 --> 25:07.314
So you can either tell me now
or I can make you suffer.

25:08.108 --> 25:10.896
You wanna suffer?

25:10.986 --> 25:14.818
I already told you. I'm not afraid to die.

25:14.907 --> 25:20.494
The only way you're gonna die today
is if I kill you. Your bomb's not going off.

25:20.579 --> 25:22.987
- We have a live feed.
- Patch it through.

25:23.082 --> 25:24.790
Go.

25:33.467 --> 25:39.506
Those men will kill your family
if you don't tell me where the bomb is now.

25:52.069 --> 25:55.652
I despise you for making me do this.

25:55.739 --> 25:57.946
They're waiting for my order.

26:00.578 --> 26:04.326
This is your last chance. Where's the bomb?

26:17.987 --> 26:20.063
Sir.

26:21.699 --> 26:25.827
Are you aware Jack Bauer's
threatening the lives of Syed Ali's family?

26:25.912 --> 26:27.620
No.

26:27.705 --> 26:30.955
- Where is the family?
- In their own country.

26:31.042 --> 26:36.831
CTU's been in contact with the security forces
there who have Ali's family in custody.

26:36.923 --> 26:41.134
We just got word that Jack has requested
they kill the family one by one

26:41.219 --> 26:44.255
till Ali tells us the location of the bomb.

26:52.105 --> 26:56.850
- Would the security forces do this?
- They do act against civilians.

26:56.943 --> 27:04.239
And their government is afraid of retaliation
if a bomb does go off. Yes, I think they would.

27:08.830 --> 27:13.741
Can we let this happen?
Condone the murder of innocent people?

27:13.835 --> 27:18.128
The bomb is an act of war
and wars result in civilian casualties.

27:18.214 --> 27:20.966
I don't want a rationale here, Mike.

27:21.050 --> 27:24.633
I don't know of a war where
a president targeted children.

27:24.720 --> 27:30.593
Compare this to a weapons factory
near a hospital - a situation we have faced.

27:30.685 --> 27:35.726
A bombing would still be ordered on the logic
that many more people will be saved

27:35.815 --> 27:39.018
by the destruction of the factory.

27:39.110 --> 27:42.443
The numbers are even more compelling here.

27:42.530 --> 27:46.859
A few people may have to die
to save millions.

27:50.079 --> 27:52.831
How could it have come to this?

28:05.386 --> 28:08.589
Your wife's been writing
you letters every day.

28:08.681 --> 28:11.801
She doesn't know where to send them.

28:12.769 --> 28:16.683
Your son Asad wants to grow up
and be just like you.

28:21.194 --> 28:23.519
Turns 12 next week.

28:24.363 --> 28:27.151
I don't think he's gonna make it.

28:35.750 --> 28:37.722
I know what it's like to lose someone,

28:38.967 --> 28:42.251
to watch them get killed
right in front of you.

28:42.340 --> 28:45.923
I don't wanna hurt your family.

28:46.010 --> 28:52.843
But I will order those men to pull that trigger
if you don't give me the information I need.

28:54.811 --> 28:57.052
I am...

28:57.146 --> 28:59.637
I am doing Allah's work.

29:01.359 --> 29:05.606
No. You're going to kill millions of people,
that's what you're doing.

29:06.864 --> 29:08.904
Agent Bauer.

29:08.991 --> 29:12.195
It's important. It's the president.

29:19.293 --> 29:20.836
This is Jack Bauer.

29:20.920 --> 29:23.874
Can't let you do this, Jack.

29:23.965 --> 29:30.217
Sir, Ali was willing to take his own life
to complete his mission.

29:30.304 --> 29:32.630
His only vulnerability is his family.

29:32.723 --> 29:36.139
It is not the policy of this country
to kill innocent children.

29:36.227 --> 29:38.932
The action would take place in his country.

29:39.021 --> 29:42.437
You would not be involved.
This would be a field decision.

29:42.525 --> 29:46.819
My decision is final. I'm sorry, Jack.

29:47.488 --> 29:49.564
Yes, sir.

29:52.493 --> 29:55.245
I understand, Mr President.

29:55.329 --> 29:59.113
No, I do not think that
there is another alternative.

29:59.208 --> 30:02.743
I know it's a difficult decision, sir.

30:04.630 --> 30:05.828
Yes, sir.

30:07.383 --> 30:11.547
Thank you for your support, Mr President.

30:11.637 --> 30:14.093
He authorised the action.

30:28.404 --> 30:32.188
- Roger Stanton isn't available.
- When can I talk to him?

30:32.283 --> 30:34.192
That's all I can say, Rich.

30:34.285 --> 30:38.947
If you have a tactical question, talk to
Scott Grant. He's got the NSA playbook.

30:39.040 --> 30:41.246
- I can use your name?
- Sure.

30:41.334 --> 30:44.750
Mike. Can I just have
a quick word with you, please?

30:44.837 --> 30:46.213
Yeah, sure, Lynne.

30:50.301 --> 30:53.836
I don't trust Sherry Palmer.
She shouldn't be here.

30:53.930 --> 30:59.007
I'm up to my eyeballs trying to hide this
interrogation with Stanton from Washington.

30:59.102 --> 31:01.937
If you have a problem,
deal with it yourself.

31:02.021 --> 31:05.971
I think you know me well enough
to know this is not some battle over turf.

31:06.067 --> 31:10.017
- This is about Roger Stanton.
- What?

31:10.113 --> 31:14.775
I was waiting for the appropriate time
to tell you. I wanted to be sure.

31:14.867 --> 31:18.402
Someone has approached me
with evidence of communications

31:18.496 --> 31:21.367
between Roger Stanton and Sherry Palmer,

31:21.457 --> 31:24.873
and it has been over the last six months.

31:26.421 --> 31:29.836
Roger said he met her today
for the first time.

31:29.924 --> 31:32.082
Yes. I know.

31:37.849 --> 31:40.422
My God.

31:43.688 --> 31:50.770
You've known Sherry for a very long time.
Is today indicative of how she operates?

31:53.156 --> 31:56.738
Then this shouldn't be
too much of a shock to you.

31:57.535 --> 32:04.498
Sherry Palmer's a lot of things,
but a traitor to this country?

32:04.584 --> 32:09.329
I don't believe that.
What kind of communication? Phone calls?

32:09.422 --> 32:12.873
Yes. Phone calls, emails. Mike.

32:12.967 --> 32:15.043
Face to face.

32:17.346 --> 32:19.505
Who's your source on this?

32:19.599 --> 32:22.090
It's been through an intermediary,

32:22.185 --> 32:27.012
but I actually have a meeting
with the source in about ten minutes.

32:27.106 --> 32:29.514
- Where?
- Off site.

32:31.861 --> 32:36.689
- Are you telling the president?
- No. He's got enough on his plate already.

32:36.783 --> 32:42.702
And he'd want proof, anyway.
You go ahead with your meeting.

32:42.789 --> 32:45.280
Let me know what happens.

32:47.627 --> 32:51.292
- Be careful.
- I will. Thank you.

32:56.219 --> 32:57.481
Shall we proceed as planned?

32:57.558 --> 33:00.596
Affirmative.
Start with the older son, Asad.

33:00.681 --> 33:03.635
If that's not successful,
move on to his younger son.

33:03.726 --> 33:07.973
- Copy that. Waiting for your orders.
- We are a go.

33:11.943 --> 33:13.401
I can't wait any longer.

33:13.501 --> 33:16.688
Tell me where the bomb
is or I will kill Asad.

33:20.034 --> 33:23.342
Ali,
I know you think what you're doing is right,

33:23.642 --> 33:25.408
but it's my job to not let it happen.

33:25.498 --> 33:26.791
Please don't make me do this.

33:27.159 --> 33:31.287
Asad is just a boy.
Tell me where the bomb is!

33:31.379 --> 33:35.079
Tell me where the bomb is! Fine.

33:35.174 --> 33:37.250
Kill him!

33:40.972 --> 33:44.092
No! No!

33:52.734 --> 33:54.643
Tell me where the bomb is!

33:56.237 --> 34:02.192
- Tell me, and I'll spare your family!
- I will not tell you!

35:00.995 --> 35:05.324
Your meeting's changed. Now it's with me.

35:08.127 --> 35:10.878
No, don't go anywhere, Lynne.
We need to talk.

35:10.963 --> 35:13.169
- I don't think so.
- Yes, we do.

35:13.257 --> 35:18.880
You think you've connected me to Roger.
That's exactly what they want you to think.

35:18.971 --> 35:22.755
- Who is "they"?
- The people Roger's conspiring with.

35:23.642 --> 35:28.684
So you're confirming that Roger Stanton
is involved? He knew about this bomb?

35:28.772 --> 35:33.102
Roger's more involved
than David could possibly know.

35:33.193 --> 35:36.230
What the hell does that mean?

35:36.322 --> 35:42.111
- This conspiracy, what is its goal, then?
- To take over the presidency.

35:42.202 --> 35:46.414
These people are feeding you
misinformation about me

35:46.498 --> 35:49.072
because they're afraid I'll get in the way.

35:49.168 --> 35:51.540
How did you know about this meeting?

35:51.629 --> 35:54.380
I don't have to be involved
to know the moves.

35:54.465 --> 35:58.509
If you knew what Roger was doing,
why haven't you said anything?

35:58.594 --> 36:02.841
Probably for the same reasons you're
keeping this line of inquiry to yourself.

36:02.931 --> 36:06.217
I want to have as much
concrete evidence as possible.

36:06.310 --> 36:12.313
Sherry, you could have said any of this to me
back at the retreat. Why come here?

36:12.399 --> 36:16.693
To make a point. That's all.

36:18.113 --> 36:20.984
To make a point?

36:21.825 --> 36:24.696
I think this is a warning.

36:24.787 --> 36:29.947
I think you orchestrated all of this
to show me how powerful you are.

36:30.042 --> 36:33.874
You have your own and not the president's
best interest at heart.

36:33.963 --> 36:41.508
I will do everything to make sure you don't
hurt him or undermine this administration.

36:57.820 --> 37:00.856
Asad is dead. There's nothing
I can do to change that.

37:00.948 --> 37:03.818
You can still save Fareed's life.

37:03.909 --> 37:06.863
I'll give you ten seconds. Where's the bomb?

37:06.954 --> 37:12.826
You're running out of time.
I will tell these men to kill your last son!

37:12.918 --> 37:15.243
Where is the bomb?

37:15.337 --> 37:17.626
That's it. Take him out!

37:19.091 --> 37:21.760
- I will tell you!
- Hold it.

37:21.844 --> 37:23.753
- I will tell you.
- Tell me now!

37:23.846 --> 37:28.093
- It is at Norton Airfield.
- Why? What's the plan?

37:29.643 --> 37:34.601
We were going to fly over downtown
and detonate it.

37:37.568 --> 37:42.277
It is true. It is... it is true.

37:50.289 --> 37:52.531
- Dessler.
- It's Jack. Get me Mason.

37:52.624 --> 37:54.701
It's Jack.

37:55.544 --> 37:56.659
What do you have?

37:56.754 --> 38:00.917
The bomb's at Norton Airfield.
They're planning to fly it over the city.

38:01.008 --> 38:06.168
Norton's a medium-size airfield.
They do cargo, private aviation.

38:06.263 --> 38:11.850
Every plane's tail number begins with the
letter "N". That's probably what this refers to.

38:11.935 --> 38:14.058
OK. We're on our way.

38:14.146 --> 38:17.645
We're moving units Bravo,
Echo and Lima to Norton Airfield,

38:17.733 --> 38:20.224
where we believe that the bomb is located.

38:20.319 --> 38:23.688
Call FAA and have them
ground flights in or out of Norton.

38:23.781 --> 38:28.656
If they do get the plane in the air, we wanna
have two F-16s at the ready to intercept.

38:28.744 --> 38:32.528
We'll get bomb units and SWAT teams
over there as well, so just move.

38:32.623 --> 38:37.581
And, remember, the "no unnecessary contact"
rule remains in place.

38:44.551 --> 38:48.300
Put Miss Warner against the wall.

38:48.389 --> 38:52.517
You killed my boy!
You killed my boy! You killed my boy!

38:52.601 --> 38:56.433
I will get you for this!
You will die for this!

39:00.192 --> 39:04.653
How could you? You're worse than they are.

39:04.738 --> 39:09.649
Reroute the satellite back to normal feed.
I want confirmation.

39:09.743 --> 39:14.536
Rerouted satellite.
You should have live picture now.

39:15.457 --> 39:17.533
Thank you.

39:18.210 --> 39:20.748
Hold this for me.

39:22.923 --> 39:25.295
We're gonna come in from the north.

39:25.384 --> 39:30.461
Set up our men coming in from the south
from these two gates.

39:34.310 --> 39:36.765
He's alive.

39:40.691 --> 39:43.526
It was all an act.

39:46.613 --> 39:49.365
Kate, come with me,
help me talk to your sister.

39:49.450 --> 39:50.778
What? Where?

39:50.868 --> 39:53.904
Norton Airfield.
It's where the bomb's located.

39:53.996 --> 39:57.080
- Do you really think she's there?
- Yes, I do.

39:58.917 --> 40:04.623
- Please, Kate, we don't have much time.
- OK.

40:05.299 --> 40:06.330
Come on.

40:10.721 --> 40:12.797
Here you go, sir.

40:24.360 --> 40:28.192
Wake up. Stay with me, Mr Stanton. Wake up.

40:28.280 --> 40:33.191
There we go. Who else knew
about the bomb, Mr Stanton?
