00:23.732 --> 00:26.906
I regret to announce
that Kenny Dalglish

00:26.944 --> 00:30.073
told the board yesterday of his wish
to retire as team manager.

00:32.573 --> 00:34.827
Ever since then, the board
have made strenuous attempts

00:34.868 --> 00:36.620
to make him change his mind.

00:40.040 --> 00:42.338
Well, obviously,
I've been involved

00:43.293 --> 00:46.843
in football since I've been 17
and for 20 years really

00:46.880 --> 00:51.431
I've been with the two most
successful clubs in Britain

00:51.468 --> 00:52.811
and I've been...

00:52.844 --> 00:54.517
I've been in the front line...

00:56.598 --> 00:59.021
in... in... for 20 years.

00:59.518 --> 01:04.274
And it's just really a result of 20 years'
active involvement in football

01:04.313 --> 01:06.157
at a very high and successful level

01:07.609 --> 01:09.987
that really I'm...

01:10.028 --> 01:13.749
kind of reached a person
that's pushed himself to the limit.

01:15.200 --> 01:16.372
Urn...

01:18.203 --> 01:20.752
It's something that's taken rne
a long time to come to.

01:21.540 --> 01:23.580
When did you
start thinking about it, Ken?

01:23.834 --> 01:26.234
Do you want me to keep talking
or are you going to interrupt?

01:27.546 --> 01:30.891
But the most important thing...

01:32.134 --> 01:35.559
and the worst decision I could have
come to is not to have made a decision.

02:34.154 --> 02:35.326
Dalglish!

02:36.615 --> 02:38.162
Dalglish!

03:08.146 --> 03:12.526
<i>I got</i> a <i>phone call
completely out the blue</i>

03:12.567 --> 03:13.819
<i>from Peter Robinson</i>

03:13.860 --> 03:16.739
<i>saying him and the chairman would
like to come and have a word.</i>

03:17.364 --> 03:18.832
<i>I said, 'Yeah, no problem.'</i>

03:20.200 --> 03:21.452
<i>So I came.</i>

03:21.493 --> 03:24.246
<i>They asked if I'd like to
become manager.</i>

03:25.497 --> 03:27.170
<i>I asked them 'Why?'</i>

03:28.583 --> 03:30.460
<i>But they never told me why, really.</i>

03:39.553 --> 03:42.727
<i>But that was it.
That was my exit out of the dressing room</i>

03:43.598 --> 03:48.229
<i>to being in isolation at the bottom of
the corridor in the manager's office.</i>

04:14.755 --> 04:17.303
I'm afraid the news is
very bad from Brussels.

04:17.339 --> 04:19.468
Hooliganism has struck again

04:19.509 --> 04:22.058
and I'm afraid the scenes
are as bad as anything

04:22.095 --> 04:24.063
we've seen for a long, long time.

04:29.770 --> 04:31.363
Ah...

04:34.900 --> 04:37.904
Generally speaking, whether we
get beat in the football match

04:37.944 --> 04:41.539
I'll have a quip or I'll laugh a bit
but I'm not laughing tonight.

04:44.075 --> 04:46.419
Thousands of Liverpool soccer
fans are in Brussels

04:46.453 --> 04:49.081
for tonight's European Cup Final
against Juventus.

04:49.122 --> 04:52.126
It will be the last for Liverpool's
manager, Joe Fagan

04:52.167 --> 04:55.546
who has announced that he is retiring
whether his team win or lose.

04:55.587 --> 04:57.715
I think it'll lift the team tonight
more than anything.

04:57.756 --> 05:00.476
They'll want to go out there tonight
and really win it for Joe Fagan.

05:02.427 --> 05:04.429
I was delighted by playing.

05:04.471 --> 05:07.441
I was a footballer,
I wanted to be a footballer.

05:09.059 --> 05:10.777
Everybody knew Joe was retiring.

05:10.811 --> 05:12.529
He was only doing it
for two years.

05:14.356 --> 05:17.360
Between them asking me to do it

05:18.026 --> 05:19.903
and becoming the manager

05:19.945 --> 05:22.573
I had exactly the same thought
all the way through.

05:23.907 --> 05:25.375
To win the game.

05:28.203 --> 05:29.705
How you doing, mate? You OK?

05:29.746 --> 05:31.714
Dig. Jocky.
- How you doing? You alright?

05:31.748 --> 05:32.965
Good to see you.

05:32.999 --> 05:34.922
It seems that the
manager's resignation has increased

05:34.960 --> 05:37.588
the fans' determination to
beat Juventus.

05:37.629 --> 05:40.678
It could have a more unsettling
effect on the players.

05:40.715 --> 05:43.343
But there's nothing that
the entire Liverpool contingent

05:43.385 --> 05:46.764
would like more than to reward
Joe Fagan's decades of service

05:46.847 --> 05:48.520
with the European Cup.

05:50.600 --> 05:53.023
Everyone was saying when
we picked up our tickets, you know.

05:53.024 --> 05:54.737
'We haven't got the whole end.

05:54.771 --> 05:59.743
There's gonna be so-called neutral
fans from Brussels in one section.'

05:59.776 --> 06:02.074
Brussels had a massive Italian community.

06:02.112 --> 06:05.366
We knew those tickets
would go on the black market.

06:05.407 --> 06:07.375
We could foresee problems.

06:08.243 --> 06:13.295
It was supposed to be, right,
neutrals in that little bit here

06:13.331 --> 06:17.086
and then there was a chicken-wire fence
and then the Liverpool fans.

06:18.587 --> 06:23.809
At 10 to six we go and have a look
at the pitch. We picked <i>up...</i>

06:23.842 --> 06:25.844
it was like a half brick.

06:25.886 --> 06:29.186
Who brings a half brick
with them into the stadium?

06:29.222 --> 06:32.066
In actual fact, it was the stadium
that was crumbling.

06:33.894 --> 06:38.149
And so you sort of went,
'Hmmm, this ain't great.'

06:43.862 --> 06:48.333
A group of Liverpool fans decided
that they were gonna charge

06:48.366 --> 06:52.542
across the terrace into the corner.

06:53.872 --> 06:58.594
It caused a wave of crush
and a wall collapsed.

07:00.754 --> 07:02.506
Good evening,
this is Clive Tyldesley

07:02.547 --> 07:04.515
in the Heysel Stadium
in Brussels

07:04.549 --> 07:07.177
where Europe's premier
football match of the season

07:07.218 --> 07:10.973
has now been completely
overshadowed by scenes of violence

07:11.014 --> 07:13.938
the likes of which I've never seen
in a football ground before.

07:23.276 --> 07:25.779
We were right beside
where it was all happening.

07:25.820 --> 07:29.575
We saw the wall come down
and one of the girls

07:29.616 --> 07:31.038
went outside and above.

07:31.076 --> 07:33.044
It was horrendous.

07:34.204 --> 07:39.176
Well, for the last
50 minutes the Heysel Stadium

07:39.209 --> 07:43.259
in Brussels,
the capital of Belgium

07:43.296 --> 07:46.391
has been a sickening and
bewildering sight.

07:48.259 --> 07:51.058
There was rumours in
the dressing room

07:51.096 --> 07:53.394
and then the rumours were
changing every five minutes.

07:54.933 --> 07:57.527
How long were you in there
before you went back out?

07:58.228 --> 08:00.151
Must have been over an hour.

08:04.567 --> 08:06.569
Really the game was an insignificance.
- Yeah.

08:07.278 --> 08:08.404
But they just said...

08:08.446 --> 08:10.540
I suppose that was... they thought
that was the best way

08:10.573 --> 08:13.793
to see it through
was to have the game.

08:15.412 --> 08:18.541
What that must have been
like for young men

08:19.541 --> 08:23.637
to actually have a consciousness
and an understanding

08:23.670 --> 08:26.139
of what the hell was
going on around them

08:26.172 --> 08:29.301
and to react in such a way
that they could just play

08:29.302 --> 08:31.519
a normal game of football
like ever before.

08:33.847 --> 08:36.817
And the Liverpool team appear.

08:37.892 --> 08:39.690
And all credit to them.

08:42.981 --> 08:45.609
I walked out to the field
and I looked left.

08:45.650 --> 08:48.369
You could see the carnage,
and there were still ambulances there.

08:49.863 --> 08:52.412
We... we played.

08:53.450 --> 08:56.124
That was the decision that was taken.

08:56.161 --> 09:00.837
And we know that they were
playing in a daze.

09:03.918 --> 09:08.389
Subconsciously you know that there's
something happened, isn't there?

09:09.132 --> 09:11.055
You're not oblivious to what's
going on round about

09:11.092 --> 09:12.514
although you don't know the facts.

09:17.932 --> 09:20.185
Between two.

09:20.226 --> 09:21.944
Yes, a penalty's gonna be given.

09:23.396 --> 09:25.148
They get a penalty awarded...

09:28.610 --> 09:30.578
which Platini put away.

09:30.612 --> 09:32.330
Out by Scirea.

09:33.948 --> 09:37.077
And Liverpool's run of success

09:37.118 --> 09:40.213
in European Cup Finals
comes to an end.

09:41.664 --> 09:45.259
But this is not a night when
football will be remembered.

09:45.293 --> 09:48.547
The official figures of the tragedy

09:48.588 --> 09:51.341
which occurred before
a ball was kicked.

09:51.382 --> 09:55.353
36 people killed, more than
200 injured

09:55.386 --> 09:57.354
and 15 of them seriously.

09:59.307 --> 10:02.151
How would any of us
respond to a situation like that?

10:04.395 --> 10:06.944
It's a football match.
It's a joyous occasion.

10:06.981 --> 10:08.608
It's the biggest game of the season.

10:08.650 --> 10:10.869
And people are dying around me.

10:13.571 --> 10:17.621
We were up until late and just talking
about how could it happen.

10:20.453 --> 10:23.423
The next day I went to the shops
and actually, I was embarrassed.

10:23.456 --> 10:26.460
I felt really ashamed.
It was a horrible time.

10:27.961 --> 10:30.305
The majority of fans didn't behave
reprehensibly.

10:30.338 --> 10:32.761
The majority of fans
condemned those who did.

10:34.968 --> 10:38.848
And Liverpool fans didn't have a
history of that kind of violence

10:38.888 --> 10:41.391
and it besmirched the club's name.

10:41.432 --> 10:45.403
It reduced the club incredibly
in the public eye.

10:45.436 --> 10:47.279
It had massive consequences.

10:47.313 --> 10:51.864
And quite rightly, Liverpool was
banned from European tournaments.

10:54.696 --> 10:55.993
We came back to Liverpool.

10:56.030 --> 10:58.328
Joe Fagan was crying
and everybody was crying.

10:58.366 --> 11:01.870
I mean, it was, like, horrible.
It was a horrible, horrible time.

11:04.289 --> 11:06.291
Do you think the game
should have been played?

11:06.332 --> 11:08.835
It wasn't for rne to make
the opinion, was it?

11:08.877 --> 11:11.221
We were asked to play and we played.

11:11.254 --> 11:13.348
A lot of people, though,
thought it was a bad decision.

11:13.381 --> 11:15.850
Well, we didn't realise what had
happened before the game.

11:15.884 --> 11:17.511
You had no idea that
people had been killed?

11:17.552 --> 11:18.724
<i>No.</i>

11:19.304 --> 11:21.306
It's a shame really that
something like that

11:21.347 --> 11:23.315
the biggest club game in the world

11:23.349 --> 11:26.193
and it's ended in disaster
for so many people.

11:27.520 --> 11:29.522
If it was difficult for me to deal with

11:29.564 --> 11:32.693
it would have been much more difficult
for the people who suffered a loss.

11:34.736 --> 11:36.736
You've just got to deal
with the hand you're dealt.

11:53.379 --> 11:55.347
<i>Your parents are the ultimate.</i>

11:55.348 --> 11:56.842
<i>They shape your life.</i>

11:56.883 --> 11:59.853
<i>They mould you into what you
become later on in your life.</i>

12:01.804 --> 12:03.522
<i>I really enjoyed growing up.</i>

12:03.556 --> 12:05.399
<i>Everyone was in the same boat.</i>

12:05.433 --> 12:06.980
<i>Everybody got out and played.</i>

12:07.018 --> 12:08.395
<i>A lot of young families there.</i>

12:09.437 --> 12:10.905
<i>And a lot of friends.</i>

12:12.106 --> 12:16.327
<i>I think it was always better
to do somebody a good turn</i>

12:16.361 --> 12:17.829
<i>than a bad turn.</i>

12:18.988 --> 12:20.535
<i>My sister Carol and I
were brought up</i>

12:20.573 --> 12:23.668
<i>with very good family values.</i>

12:24.327 --> 12:28.298
I'm supposed to run out and
throw my arms around wide...

12:30.291 --> 12:32.462
How are we?
- Hiya. How are you?

12:32.463 --> 12:34.133
Good. Nay problems.
- Yeah.

12:35.213 --> 12:38.638
The old house there.
I cannae believe just how long it's been.

12:39.050 --> 12:40.677
It's just so familiar.
- It is.

12:40.718 --> 12:42.470
There's an awful lot of memories
round about here.

12:42.512 --> 12:44.765
Oh, I know.
- They all come back when you come back.

12:46.057 --> 12:49.186
- I thought I was alright.
- No, no, no, you weren't.

12:49.227 --> 12:51.104
Not when you were young,
really young.

12:51.145 --> 12:53.145
I thought I was OK.
- Up until you were about five.

12:53.564 --> 12:56.067
<i>My mum stayed at
home and ran the house.</i>

12:57.151 --> 12:58.619
<i>My dad went to work.</i>

12:58.653 --> 13:00.747
<i>He was a diesel engine fitter.</i>

13:00.780 --> 13:04.375
<i>I think my dad first introduced me
to a ball before I could walk.</i>

13:04.409 --> 13:08.334
<i>He used to hold me and let me
have a kick at a ball.</i>

13:09.289 --> 13:11.758
He liked you to
sit up straight at the table

13:11.791 --> 13:13.919
and not leave the table
till you'd finished your meal.

13:13.960 --> 13:18.636
A lot of the time it was only speak
if you're spoken to type of thing

13:18.673 --> 13:20.675
if you were in adult company.
- A 'yes' and a 'thank you.'

13:20.717 --> 13:23.061
Yeah, yeah, so...
- 'Please.'

13:23.094 --> 13:25.563
It's great though.
It's really good to be back.

13:26.389 --> 13:28.892
<i>From a very young age
I wanted to be a footballer.</i>

13:28.933 --> 13:30.651
<i>I just loved the football.</i>

13:30.685 --> 13:34.064
<i>One of the boys' dads
made goals for us.</i>

13:34.105 --> 13:36.358
<i>He had somewhere to get nets from.</i>

13:36.399 --> 13:38.859
<i>We had a great time, really.</i>

13:38.860 --> 13:42.080
<i>Most of your spare time
was spent playing football.</i>

13:42.113 --> 13:44.707
There's so much change isn't there?
It's so different.

13:44.741 --> 13:46.459
Everything's...
Mind you, it is 50 years ago, though.

13:46.492 --> 13:48.460
It is 50 years, I was thinking
that coming over.

13:48.494 --> 13:50.462
Dad was the orange man, wasn't he?

13:50.496 --> 13:52.624
He was the man who brought
you the half-time oranges.

13:52.665 --> 13:53.917
Mum did the strips.

13:53.958 --> 13:55.710
Everybody chipped in.

13:56.711 --> 13:58.179
Up at Springburn,
before the bus went away

13:58.212 --> 13:59.304
we got our picture taken
in front of the bus.

13:59.339 --> 14:02.889
Was it? I'll need to bend down,
as I was four then!

14:06.095 --> 14:09.520
<i>You were brought up
to support either Rangers or Celtic</i>

14:09.557 --> 14:11.980
<i>and if you sat on the fence
you were a Partick Thistle fan.</i>

14:12.018 --> 14:14.612
<i>So my dad was a Rangers fan.</i>

14:15.772 --> 14:17.194
It comes back to you.
- It does.

14:17.231 --> 14:18.858
When you come here you get
one or two things coming back.

14:18.900 --> 14:20.243
Yeah.

14:24.447 --> 14:28.702
Well, it's a very great sorrow for me to
have to tell you that at this stage

14:28.743 --> 14:32.748
there are 66 persons that have lost
their lives as a result of the accident

14:32.789 --> 14:35.292
which took place on
the terracing exit.

14:36.501 --> 14:38.174
<i>I was at the game.</i>

14:38.211 --> 14:41.385
<i>We used to always go to
the same crash barrier.</i>

14:41.422 --> 14:44.551
<i>My dad's mates with his work,
they all used to meet up</i>

14:44.592 --> 14:47.061
<i>and we all used to stand there
and watch the match.</i>

14:47.720 --> 14:51.645
It looked like ending in a
draw until one minute before the end

14:51.682 --> 14:54.902
Rangers equalized and the
crowd roared in excitement.

14:54.936 --> 14:56.813
Some of those who were
halfway down the steps

14:56.854 --> 15:00.028
tried to get back into the ground
with tragic results.

15:01.067 --> 15:02.865
From the stunned city of Glasgow

15:02.902 --> 15:05.997
pictures of the aftermath of
Britain's worst ever soccer disaster.

15:08.533 --> 15:11.002
<i>There but for the grace of God go I.</i>

15:17.542 --> 15:19.010
We had to move out of here.

15:19.043 --> 15:20.419
My mum and dad thought
we should move out

15:20.420 --> 15:21.888
and get our own independence

15:21.921 --> 15:23.594
and at least have a room
to ourselves

15:23.631 --> 15:27.181
so they put in for a move
and they moved to Ibrox.

15:28.886 --> 15:31.355
<i>My mum drew a house overlooking
the training ground</i>

15:31.389 --> 15:35.064
<i>that Rangers used so I could
look out the window</i>

15:35.101 --> 15:36.193
<i>and watch Rangers training.</i>

15:36.811 --> 15:40.691
Sean Fallon went to his house
and he was the type of person

15:40.731 --> 15:43.484
when he spoke to you, you believed
him and you trusted him.

15:44.193 --> 15:46.662
<i>Sean was the
assistant manager at Celtic</i>

15:46.696 --> 15:49.870
<i>and asked if I'd like to come
and join them for training.</i>

15:50.491 --> 15:53.665
<i>He was on his way down to
the Ayrshire coast to celebrate</i>

15:53.703 --> 15:56.923
<i>his anniversary with his wife
and a couple of kids in the car.</i>

15:56.956 --> 15:59.505
<i>And they left them in the car
for about an hour.</i>

16:00.918 --> 16:04.343
Kenny had a photo
of John Greig, the Rangers captain.

16:04.380 --> 16:06.303
Which my mum wanted to take down

16:06.340 --> 16:08.013
and my dad told her to
leave it alone.

16:08.843 --> 16:11.096
So he was a Rangers fan

16:11.137 --> 16:15.859
but what Celtic
were offering him was opportunity.

16:17.435 --> 16:20.530
<i>At that time, Celtic would have
been the best place</i>

16:20.563 --> 16:24.659
<i>for any of the kids to go and try and
educate themselves to be a footballer.</i>

16:24.692 --> 16:26.820
<i>And I was fortunate to be
given the opportunity.</i>

16:27.820 --> 16:31.370
<i>There was no way we were ever
going to turn down Celtic.</i>

16:31.407 --> 16:32.954
<i>It was a no-brainer, really.</i>

16:35.286 --> 16:38.256
<i>To make your debut at
Celtic Park was massive.</i>

16:38.289 --> 16:40.838
<i>Big Jock came into the
boot room and he said</i>

16:40.875 --> 16:43.298
<i>'You're not playing for
the reserves tomorrow.</i>

16:43.336 --> 16:45.338
<i>You'll be playing for
the first team.'</i>

16:45.379 --> 16:47.347
<i>And I went, 'Oh, that's alright.'</i>

16:47.381 --> 16:49.554
<i>I turned up the next day
and Bobby Murdoch</i>

16:49.592 --> 16:52.311
<i>sat next to me and he says,
'Are you nervous?'</i>

16:52.345 --> 16:55.189
<i>I says, 'Just</i> a <i>wee bit
but not really.</i> '

16:55.223 --> 16:58.443
<i>He went, 'Well, you're putting
your right boot on your left foot.'</i>

16:59.101 --> 17:01.103
<i>I said, 'Maybe I am nervous!'</i>

17:04.272 --> 17:06.367
This has not changed one single bit.

17:06.400 --> 17:09.529
Every single thing is just
the exact same. Same houses.

17:11.489 --> 17:13.332
And then we're at the Beechwood!

17:13.366 --> 17:15.084
Oh, yeah.
The Beechwood. Yes.

17:16.452 --> 17:18.546
I was learning the pub trade.

17:18.579 --> 17:20.752
I learned in a restaurant
called the Beechwood.

17:21.915 --> 17:24.089
All of the Celtic players
used to go in there.

17:26.546 --> 17:30.176
Gosh, it's completely different,
isn't it?

17:30.216 --> 17:34.437
My dad had a pub and I was
working during the school holidays.

17:34.470 --> 17:37.599
Alex, I think he wanted to
open a pub of his own

17:37.640 --> 17:40.314
and he came in and he got
some tips on the bar trade.

17:40.351 --> 17:41.944
How are you doing?
I'm Kenny.

17:42.061 --> 17:43.654
Hi, hello. How are you?

17:43.688 --> 17:47.864
I used to work here when
I was still at school as a Saturday job.

17:47.900 --> 17:50.528
Sometimes Friday night
after school if there was a wedding

17:50.570 --> 17:53.665
and then I'd work Saturday night
just for pocket money.

17:54.490 --> 17:56.538
How did you get on with my dad?

17:56.576 --> 17:58.294
I knew your dad before I knew you.

17:58.327 --> 18:00.750
Did you? I knew Fergie
before I knew you!

18:00.788 --> 18:02.756
Fair enough, right?
So what?

18:02.790 --> 18:04.588
Your dad didn't recommend you.

18:05.543 --> 18:07.011
No?
- No.

18:07.044 --> 18:09.092
You were recommended
by Jock Stein.

18:09.130 --> 18:10.757
You were alright.
- Was I?

18:10.798 --> 18:13.642
I think this has been extended,
there was a bar there.

18:13.676 --> 18:15.303
This was where everybody sat.

18:19.265 --> 18:21.313
He was just one of
the young boys that came in.

18:21.350 --> 18:23.478
I never really noticed him at first.

18:27.523 --> 18:29.070
The thing that made him stand out

18:29.108 --> 18:30.701
was that he used to blush
all the time.

18:32.653 --> 18:35.031
He waited until my
parents went on holiday

18:35.072 --> 18:37.672
before he would ask rne out because
he was a bit scared of my dad.

18:39.368 --> 18:41.370
She said, 'You give me a phone.'

18:41.412 --> 18:43.585
I said, 'I've not got your number.'

18:45.124 --> 18:48.128
And I said,
'Well, my number's in the phone book.'

18:48.169 --> 18:49.921
Playing hard to get.

18:50.796 --> 18:53.265
And he rang rne and that was it.

18:57.970 --> 18:59.222
Do you know what you wore?
- Yeah.

18:59.263 --> 19:02.688
What?
- A wee white short raincoat.

19:02.725 --> 19:04.898
<i>I was going to her house
to pick her up.</i>

19:04.935 --> 19:06.528
What did I wear
when you picked me up?

19:06.562 --> 19:08.314
Can you remember?
- A blouse.

19:08.356 --> 19:09.824
A dress.
- Did I?

19:09.857 --> 19:11.404
I dunno, I can't remember.
Did I?

19:13.194 --> 19:15.447
When I was in that flat over there

19:15.488 --> 19:17.661
watching Kenny
come down the street...

19:17.823 --> 19:19.245
What?

19:19.283 --> 19:21.661
I was on the phone to my friend

19:21.702 --> 19:23.704
and I said 'I wonder what
car he's got.'

19:23.746 --> 19:26.920
<i>I don't know what she was
expecting me to pick her up in</i>

19:26.957 --> 19:28.834
<i>because I came off the bus.</i>

19:28.876 --> 19:31.504
We went to the cinema.

19:31.545 --> 19:35.516
<i>And then we very romantically
had fish and chips in the close</i>

19:35.549 --> 19:37.017
<i>in the tenement.</i>

19:37.051 --> 19:38.519
<i>When we came out it was raining.</i>

19:40.763 --> 19:42.310
He tried to impress.

19:43.099 --> 19:47.900
<i>So I suppose that was
our first outing as a couple.</i>

19:49.814 --> 19:52.613
There we go.
Ah, real nice date.

19:52.650 --> 19:54.823
I'm gonna ring the girls.
- Why?

19:59.490 --> 20:02.164
<i>Celtic. An unbelievable place.</i>

20:02.201 --> 20:04.329
<i>Won five trophies in '67</i>

20:04.370 --> 20:05.450
<i>including the European Cup.</i>

20:06.372 --> 20:08.374
<i>You don't get a rehearsal.</i>

20:08.416 --> 20:10.714
<i>You've got to earn the right
to belong somewhere.</i>

20:31.689 --> 20:34.442
Dalglish! Oh, a peach of a goal!

20:35.651 --> 20:36.948
<i>I was thinking about moving.</i>

20:36.986 --> 20:38.533
<i>I was captain.</i>

20:38.571 --> 20:40.414
<i>They were asking me to
sign a contract</i>

20:40.448 --> 20:42.450
<i>and I says, 'No, I don't want
to sign a contract.</i>

20:42.491 --> 20:44.539
<i>I would like to go at the end of
the season if I could.'</i>

20:44.577 --> 20:46.250
Edwards and Dalglish clashing there.

20:46.287 --> 20:48.085
He's always been single-minded.

20:48.122 --> 20:50.500
If he puts his mind to something,
he'll do it.

20:51.250 --> 20:53.298
<i>If you've asked for a move,
you know you've got to go.</i>

20:53.335 --> 20:54.712
<i>So your mind's set up to go.</i>

21:03.304 --> 21:07.559
<i>Big Jock shook my hand,
gave us a cuddle and says</i>

21:07.600 --> 21:09.898
<i>'All the best, you little bastard!'</i>

21:11.645 --> 21:15.491
Liverpool signed
Kenny Dalglish for £440,000.

21:15.524 --> 21:20.280
He's a brilliant player.
But is he as good as Keegan?

21:23.199 --> 21:26.203
We knew he was leaving going
to Hamburg and we couldn't believe it.

21:26.243 --> 21:29.122
We'd just won the European Cup.
Why would he want to leave?

21:29.163 --> 21:32.963
The public of course are already talking
about you replacing Kevin Keegan.

21:33.000 --> 21:34.843
Is that how you see it?

21:34.877 --> 21:37.130
Kevin Keegan's been here,
he's done a great job for Liverpool

21:37.171 --> 21:39.131
and Liverpool have been very good
to Kevin Keegan.

21:40.216 --> 21:43.345
Kevin Keegan was
a great player for Liverpool

21:43.385 --> 21:47.231
but I think Kenny Dalglish by far
was the better player.

21:47.264 --> 21:50.108
This club will be here long after
Kevin Keegan and myself have gone.

21:52.019 --> 21:55.489
Liverpool, after having won
the European Cup

21:55.523 --> 21:58.322
they must be the number one
club in Europe.

21:58.692 --> 22:01.491
Liverpool's reputation
was spreading round Europe.

22:01.529 --> 22:04.032
There was a feeling of invincibility.

22:04.657 --> 22:07.911
<i>I wasn't going to be Kevin.
I was going to be myself.</i>

22:07.952 --> 22:09.920
<i>And if that was going
to be good enough</i>

22:09.954 --> 22:12.173
<i>then it would be a happy story
for everybody.</i>

22:12.623 --> 22:14.091
Dalglish...

22:14.124 --> 22:16.923
Oh, that's nice!
That's lovely!

22:18.212 --> 22:20.135
He hit the ground running.

22:20.172 --> 22:23.847
Straight away you could tell,
this fella is something special.

22:23.884 --> 22:25.227
He's got a second chance

22:25.261 --> 22:26.888
because Harris's
clearance was a bad one.

22:26.929 --> 22:28.397
And he's curled it in!

22:28.430 --> 22:31.855
The minute he started
playing I was mesmerized.

22:31.892 --> 22:33.144
Kenny Dalglish!

22:33.185 --> 22:35.979
Much too good a player to be
given a second chance.

22:35.980 --> 22:37.607
We thought,
'We've had it good up until now.

22:37.648 --> 22:39.150
This is going to be great!'

22:39.191 --> 22:40.738
Dalglish, the shot and it's going in!

22:40.776 --> 22:43.976
If I was a manager, he would be the first
name on the team-sheet week after week.

22:45.197 --> 22:50.499
He had grace, he had skill
and he had football intelligence.

22:51.579 --> 22:55.083
You saw a player
that has all the time in the world.

22:56.250 --> 22:58.048
You knew there was something
special there.

22:58.919 --> 23:00.842
He had three defenders around him.

23:00.880 --> 23:03.850
He went one way, he went the other
and then he went between them.

23:03.883 --> 23:06.636
And as he came from going
the other way

23:06.677 --> 23:09.772
I'm sure his shoulder was
almost on the ground.

23:09.805 --> 23:11.773
He was like a dancer.

23:15.686 --> 23:18.938
Kenny Dalglish was born
with a great gift.

23:18.939 --> 23:22.193
And that's something I suppose
if you asked him to describe

23:22.234 --> 23:24.328
how he scored a goal or explain
how he did something

23:24.361 --> 23:25.533
he'd find it almost impossible.

23:25.571 --> 23:27.915
I do and I know Kenny would as well.

23:27.948 --> 23:31.077
His brain, you can see he's three, four
moves ahead of everyone else.

23:31.118 --> 23:34.748
And at times I've watched him play
and I've got frustrated for him

23:34.788 --> 23:37.132
because I know he's thinking
ahead of other people.

23:37.750 --> 23:40.173
Certainly, the idea is to take the battle

23:40.210 --> 23:41.757
even more now to Brugge.

23:42.671 --> 23:44.799
It was a game that was
going nowhere.

23:45.549 --> 23:47.347
Still no goals.

23:48.177 --> 23:50.396
And then this moment came.

23:50.429 --> 23:52.022
And here's Dalglish.

23:52.056 --> 23:55.060
Souness had the ball
and he divided the defense.

23:55.100 --> 23:57.899
Kenny runs on to it and then...

24:07.321 --> 24:09.244
we'd won the European Cup!

24:14.495 --> 24:17.089
<i>To score a goal
was a dream come true.</i>

24:19.416 --> 24:21.919
<i>If you scored a goal,
you got a Mini.</i>

24:22.461 --> 24:27.092
I've come in after the game and Marina
went, 'Oh, when will the Mini arrive?!'

24:27.132 --> 24:28.725
I went, 'What do you mean?'

24:28.759 --> 24:31.103
She said, 'Well, you get a Mini
for scoring the winning goal.'

24:31.136 --> 24:35.937
I went, 'Marina, it's gone for
a night out for the boys!

24:37.101 --> 24:38.694
There'll be no Mini!'

24:40.688 --> 24:43.658
<i>I always wanted to go on
an open-top bus,</i>

24:43.691 --> 24:45.785
<i>showing off the trophy.</i>

24:45.818 --> 24:47.616
<i>There was a restriction in Glasgow</i>

24:47.653 --> 24:49.701
<i>that neither Celtic or Rangers
could do a bus tour.</i>

24:50.781 --> 24:55.002
<i>Ah, that was unbelievable
the number of people that turned out.</i>

24:55.035 --> 24:59.461
<i>Also, there was a significant number
of blue and white scarves there as well.</i>

25:01.000 --> 25:04.425
<i>It was just a reflection of
the people in the city.</i>

25:08.257 --> 25:13.013
The fans, the atmosphere
was just the best.

25:17.224 --> 25:18.976
It was unbelievable.

25:19.018 --> 25:22.147
But you were usually that pissed
you cannae remember!

25:28.652 --> 25:32.122
Where there is discord,
may we bring harmony.

25:32.156 --> 25:35.160
Where there is error,
may we bring truth.

25:35.200 --> 25:38.329
Where there is doubt,
may we bring faith.

25:41.248 --> 25:43.216
I always thought that Liverpool

25:43.250 --> 25:45.799
was like a pain in the arse
to the establishment.

25:47.046 --> 25:49.925
They had no time for Liverpool
whatsoever.

25:51.008 --> 25:54.353
For more than a generation,
Liverpool had been like the hub.

25:54.386 --> 25:57.640
Everything that came into the country
more or less came into Liverpool.

25:59.391 --> 26:01.985
The country owed
quite a lot to Liverpool.

26:02.019 --> 26:04.818
But when they decided it didn't
have much more to contribute

26:04.855 --> 26:08.951
particularly under Heath and Thatcher,
'We'll give it the elbow.'

26:10.319 --> 26:12.242
It was struggling in terms of poverty

26:12.279 --> 26:15.249
it was struggling in terms of
institutionalized racism

26:15.282 --> 26:18.661
and it was struggling in terms of the
marginalization of its working class.

26:20.662 --> 26:24.508
'In the present context,
it may serve to as a useful reminder

26:24.541 --> 26:29.843
of the need to be careful not to
over-commit scarce resources to Liverpool.

26:30.506 --> 26:35.854
I cannot help feeling that
the option of managed decline

26:35.886 --> 26:39.186
is one which we should
not forget altogether.

26:39.223 --> 26:45.697
We must not expend all our resources in
trying to make water flow uphill.'

26:45.729 --> 26:50.280
That's appalling. That is appalling.

26:52.111 --> 26:54.239
These were bad times.
And serious times.

26:56.532 --> 26:58.703
You know when you're pushed
against a wall

26:58.704 --> 27:00.668
and there's nowhere else
you can go.

27:00.702 --> 27:02.579
The only way you can go
anywhere is forward.

27:04.373 --> 27:08.003
The one thing that did give
people some hope was the football.

27:08.836 --> 27:13.387
I'll never forget, you know,
walking three miles up to the ground

27:13.423 --> 27:16.097
and the feeling, the buzz
as you were getting closer.

27:17.928 --> 27:23.401
It just gave everybody in
that city something to believe in.

27:25.102 --> 27:27.196
You get heartbreak,
you share the heartbreak.

27:28.021 --> 27:29.739
<i>When they thought
we were a little bit down</i>

27:29.773 --> 27:31.366
<i>they could lift us.</i>

27:31.400 --> 27:32.697
<i>And when you scored a goal...</i>

27:34.236 --> 27:35.533
Well, you share in it.

27:36.196 --> 27:38.699
What else have you got to look for?

27:38.740 --> 27:40.492
And all's you've got is the football.

27:41.535 --> 27:43.412
<i>We'd feel as happy as they did.</i>

27:44.288 --> 27:46.791
I know what's going on all week
and I know we're having a bad time

27:46.832 --> 27:48.755
and I know conditions are
not right but never mind

27:48.792 --> 27:50.840
we've got Saturday
to look forward to.

27:52.004 --> 27:55.508
If you economically marginalize
communities

27:55.549 --> 27:58.473
they won't go away
with their tail between their legs.

27:58.510 --> 28:00.353
They will fight back.

28:02.097 --> 28:04.225
<i>7</i> minutes to 3.

28:04.266 --> 28:07.861
Without a shadow of doubt,
somebody would shout, 'Stick together.'

28:07.895 --> 28:10.775
"Ever Fallen In Love" by Buzzcocks

28:18.113 --> 28:19.615
Dalglish...

28:19.656 --> 28:21.078
It might break for him.
It does!

28:32.920 --> 28:35.298
It's Dalglish,
and he turns! That's a goal!

28:57.194 --> 29:01.540
I signed for Liverpool as a teenager.
I think 300,000.

29:01.573 --> 29:03.871
But I was really panicking.

29:03.909 --> 29:05.832
So first thing,
I walk in the dressing room

29:05.869 --> 29:08.497
I got changed next to Ray Clemence,
Alan Hansen.

29:08.538 --> 29:11.087
You know, and I didn't say
a word and everything.

29:11.124 --> 29:13.752
And I always remember you lot,
the famous one was saying

29:13.794 --> 29:16.263
'You got changed
in the dark did you?' You know?

29:16.296 --> 29:19.175
And everyone was like taking
the mickey and all that

29:19.216 --> 29:21.264
and I didn't know how to take it
to tell you the truth.

29:21.301 --> 29:22.461
I was really panicking, like.

29:24.221 --> 29:25.643
Rushie, you normally
put them in.

29:26.139 --> 29:27.436
I missed it altogether!

29:27.474 --> 29:29.351
A huge part of the success
as the club

29:29.393 --> 29:31.111
was the atmosphere in
the dressing room

29:31.144 --> 29:33.442
and if somebody walks into
the dressing room

29:33.480 --> 29:35.653
the best way to make
them feel part of it

29:35.691 --> 29:37.819
is maybe not to rip them
to bits but...

29:37.859 --> 29:39.031
But you did!

29:39.069 --> 29:40.742
I know, but we were
spoiled for it.

29:40.779 --> 29:42.827
We had loads of ammunition,
didn't we?

29:42.864 --> 29:45.367
Yeah.

29:45.409 --> 29:47.286
What's he like off the pitch?

29:47.327 --> 29:50.752
In 5-a-side, d'you mean?
Or away from the pitch?

29:50.789 --> 29:52.507
I don't know. He doesn't talk.

29:52.541 --> 29:54.009
Nobody knows!

29:54.042 --> 29:56.886
I must say I like your cat.
Are you fond of animals?

29:56.920 --> 30:00.800
Yes, my favourite is a seal.
And I also like whales.

30:00.841 --> 30:02.218
Well, where do you keep them?

30:02.259 --> 30:04.853
Well, now, I spend most of my time
around the pool.

30:04.886 --> 30:06.888
There are a lots of big fish there.

30:08.056 --> 30:11.686
<i>If you're winding them up
or having a laugh at their expense</i>

30:11.727 --> 30:14.401
<i>it's almost like you
welcome them.</i>

30:14.438 --> 30:16.611
The first impression,
no, I didn't like Kenny.

30:17.441 --> 30:20.615
I was very shy and also
I remember about Kenny

30:20.652 --> 30:22.154
he just took the mickey out of me.

30:22.195 --> 30:25.449
<i>Yeah, I got a wee bit on top of him
I think at the very beginning.</i>

30:25.490 --> 30:28.744
So in trying to be helpful,
although it might sound cruel

30:28.785 --> 30:31.629
the help that you were giving him,
we almost lost him.

30:32.622 --> 30:35.250
Almost lost him.
What a tragedy that would have been.

30:35.292 --> 30:39.798
Onside. Ian Rush.
1-0 Liverpool. Brilliant goal!

30:39.838 --> 30:43.183
Then after about 6 or 7 months,
you realised everyone's in it together.

30:43.216 --> 30:45.264
That's what the true
Liverpool spirit was, wasn't it?

30:45.302 --> 30:48.021
Aye.
- As you say, it wasn't just the games.

30:48.055 --> 30:50.145
Going in everyday,
knowing about what's going on

30:50.146 --> 30:51.562
about the club and everything.

30:51.600 --> 30:53.022
As Kenny was getting older

30:53.060 --> 30:54.983
he said, 'Now you can help rne
with the running and all that.'

30:55.020 --> 30:56.317
And that's what you do.

30:56.355 --> 30:59.234
He said, 'Your job is just
to score goals.

30:59.274 --> 31:00.651
Leave the rest to me.

31:00.692 --> 31:03.161
When I get the ball,
you just run into that space.'

31:03.195 --> 31:05.072
Dalglish. Rush.

31:05.113 --> 31:07.582
He didn't even look.
He just put the ball in that space.

31:08.200 --> 31:11.750
There you see just why
Ian Rush is feared so much.

31:11.787 --> 31:13.004
That's how good Kenny was.

31:13.038 --> 31:15.882
And I thought, 'I can get to like this.'

31:15.916 --> 31:16.963
Because I was quick

31:17.000 --> 31:18.252
Dalglish, look at that. Rush is through...

31:18.293 --> 31:20.466
And I had like two yards
on the defenders.

31:22.631 --> 31:26.135
He's hit the post.
He might score now... he has!

31:26.885 --> 31:28.683
It was his football brain.

31:28.720 --> 31:30.768
He can see things
way before anyone else.

31:30.806 --> 31:32.558
Neal's clearance to Dalglish.

31:32.599 --> 31:33.942
Beautiful turn.

31:33.975 --> 31:36.603
Oh, and on for Rush
with a perfect through ball.

31:38.021 --> 31:39.701
Because I managed to get
on his wavelength.

31:40.315 --> 31:41.942
Ian Rush celebrates the goal

31:41.983 --> 31:44.987
but Kenny Dalglish,
the creator supreme.

31:46.238 --> 31:48.707
What he was best at
was turning defenders.

31:49.574 --> 31:51.702
Splendid turn.
Clemence in the way again

31:51.743 --> 31:53.791
but Rush... and still Clemence...

31:53.829 --> 31:55.797
Then once he turned defenders
he was either in himself

31:55.831 --> 31:57.424
or he'd put someone else in.

31:57.457 --> 32:00.711
Straight on from Dalglish to Rush...

32:02.421 --> 32:03.421
and it's in at last!

32:05.173 --> 32:07.676
<i>He was not one for self-glory.</i>

32:07.717 --> 32:09.936
<i>He was a reflection of what
Liverpool was all about.</i>

32:11.721 --> 32:14.816
Ronnie Whelan came in at
the same time as you

32:14.850 --> 32:16.773
and he used to take the piss
out of you as well.

32:19.729 --> 32:21.481
Kenny for me is the best
Liverpool player

32:21.523 --> 32:22.900
they've had in their history.

32:22.941 --> 32:24.909
He's the King without doubt.

32:33.535 --> 32:36.129
This afternoon, Liverpool appointed
a new player-manager

32:36.163 --> 32:40.505
to replace Joe Fagan, who announced
his retirement before yesterday's match.

32:40.506 --> 32:44.755
He's Kenny Dalglish, one of Liverpool's
most capped international players.

32:54.764 --> 32:57.108
<i>Shanks built the place
for everybody.</i>

32:57.142 --> 32:59.611
<i>Old Bob carried it on.
Joe Fagan was next.</i>

32:59.644 --> 33:01.817
<i>And then I'm thrown into that.</i>

33:03.190 --> 33:06.569
He came to rne room and
he said, 'I need a bit of advice.'

33:06.610 --> 33:10.490
He says, 'What about management?
What do you think?'

33:11.323 --> 33:12.870
I says, 'Do you fancy it?'

33:12.908 --> 33:16.287
He says, 'Yeah, well, there could be
something in the offing.'

33:16.328 --> 33:18.581
And a few weeks later
he's the manager of Liverpool.

33:19.456 --> 33:22.209
When I saw that, I says,
'You bugger, you've...

33:22.250 --> 33:23.923
you've had me!'

33:26.129 --> 33:28.257
We were going out for something
to eat with the girls

33:28.298 --> 33:31.051
and he just turned around and he said,
'I've got news for you.

33:31.092 --> 33:34.220
They've asked rne to become manager of
Liverpool and I've accepted.'

33:34.221 --> 33:36.644
So I said,
'Yeah, you're kidding.'

33:36.681 --> 33:38.979
He said, 'No, no, no.'
I said, 'Well...'

33:39.017 --> 33:40.894
He said, 'No, no, Joe's gone, ' he says.

33:40.936 --> 33:42.654
'And I'm gonna be
player-manager.'

33:42.687 --> 33:45.816
I mean, I had three years left
on my contract or four years left.

33:45.857 --> 33:48.986
I'd just signed a four-year contract
so I'm thinking...

33:50.028 --> 33:51.621
'Well, I'm not taking a chance here

33:51.655 --> 33:55.660
because if I'm rubbish the first year,
just take the managerial role off rne

33:55.700 --> 33:57.668
and I'll carry on in
my playing contract.'

33:58.662 --> 34:00.585
I'd never really heard about
player-managers

34:00.622 --> 34:02.420
and then when we heard that
Kenny Dalglish was gonna manage

34:02.457 --> 34:05.631
Liverpool and Liverpool were
obviously the best team in Europe

34:05.669 --> 34:07.797
how did the team respond to that?

34:07.837 --> 34:09.382
You have to call him 'boss'.

34:09.384 --> 34:11.554
He's your boss so you've
got to call him 'boss.'

34:11.591 --> 34:13.719
'That means I can't talk to you now.'

34:13.760 --> 34:15.637
And he said,
'Oh, nothing's gonna change.'

34:15.679 --> 34:17.226
I said, 'Nothing's gonna change?

34:17.639 --> 34:19.357
You've got to be kidding, ain't you?'

34:19.391 --> 34:22.059
He knew that in the dressing room

34:22.060 --> 34:25.438
I would never, ever tell him
anything that was going on

34:25.480 --> 34:27.482
and he didn't want that.

34:27.524 --> 34:29.902
But if there were any problems
I could go to him and say

34:29.943 --> 34:31.489
'Look, there's a bit of a
problem here.' Whatever.

34:31.527 --> 34:33.656
It worked absolutely perfectly.

34:33.697 --> 34:36.746
I remember coming back to
the house with Jannie

34:36.783 --> 34:41.458
and saying, 'That's it.
I mean, this friendship's gone.

34:41.496 --> 34:43.623
And it'll never ever come back.'

34:43.665 --> 34:46.635
But you know, he came in and...

34:47.627 --> 34:50.130
well, I mean he still has that...

34:50.170 --> 34:51.342
and he was still playing.

34:51.380 --> 34:54.054
And you know what he was like
when he got older, he got grumpier.

34:54.092 --> 34:56.389
You know, when you used
to play it into his feet

34:56.428 --> 35:00.228
you could play it five yards either
side and then when he got older

35:00.265 --> 35:01.733
you had to be spot on.

35:01.766 --> 35:04.110
Go wide on either side.

35:04.144 --> 35:05.771
<i>Phil Neal was captain.</i>

35:05.812 --> 35:08.816
<i>I swapped that and put
Alan in as captain.</i>

35:08.857 --> 35:10.575
<i>Not because he was
a better player</i>

35:10.609 --> 35:14.113
<i>not because he was a
pa! of mine</i>

35:14.154 --> 35:16.282
<i>because I thought a captain
has to be fortunate</i>

35:16.323 --> 35:18.746
<i>has to be lucky, as well as good</i>

35:18.783 --> 35:22.003
<i>and to have the respect
of the dressing room</i>

35:22.037 --> 35:23.835
<i>and I think he had all three.</i>

35:23.872 --> 35:27.046
Pre-season friendly at
Brighton, I'm sitting beside him

35:27.083 --> 35:29.882
and he goes,
'Right, you take the ball.'

35:30.462 --> 35:31.930
And I went,
'What are you talking about?'

35:31.963 --> 35:35.308
He said, 'Are you taking the piss?
You're the captain.'

35:37.636 --> 35:40.230
Never changed a thing. Did you?
Really.

35:40.263 --> 35:41.981
Monday morning,
when we used to...

35:42.015 --> 35:43.312
We had tea and biscuits.

35:45.060 --> 35:47.939
It was his idea and he even
went and bought the biscuits.

35:47.979 --> 35:50.448
Borrowed the money of course
but great idea!

35:54.694 --> 35:58.742
<i>I thought it was gonna be difficult,
it was gonna be a huge change</i>

35:58.743 --> 36:01.619
<i>but if they had the belief in me
then the least I could do</i>

36:01.660 --> 36:04.914
<i>was try and find out if I had
the belief in myself.</i>

36:04.954 --> 36:06.581
Who are the players you like?

36:06.623 --> 36:08.796
Kenny Dalglish.
- Paul Walsh.

36:08.833 --> 36:10.050
Paul Walsh!
- Jan Molby.

36:10.794 --> 36:13.923
We played Everton
and we get beaten 2-0.

36:13.963 --> 36:15.510
And Grobbelaar. Goal!

36:16.675 --> 36:19.144
And we go out for dinner at night
and I say to him

36:19.177 --> 36:21.646
'This is the worst Liverpool side
I've ever played in.'

36:21.680 --> 36:23.398
Can it be <i>2</i> for Everton?

36:23.431 --> 36:24.431
By far!

36:25.058 --> 36:26.401
It is!

36:26.851 --> 36:29.024
And he turned round and he said,
'Well, ' he said

36:29.062 --> 36:30.359
'Yeah' he said.

36:30.397 --> 36:31.819
'Maybe the players aren't
as good this season.'

36:31.856 --> 36:34.860
But if we could just
get something going

36:34.901 --> 36:36.403
you know, we could still
do something.'

36:36.444 --> 36:38.492
And I've gone,
'Have you been drinking?!'

36:40.073 --> 36:42.496
And Dalglish gets away
with Rush going on the left.

36:42.534 --> 36:47.131
On the right he's got Craig Johnston.
This is Rush. Yes!

36:48.581 --> 36:50.174
And now Johnston.

36:50.917 --> 36:54.638
And he fires it across. McMahon!
He's got his second.

36:55.839 --> 36:58.308
Gillespie getting up underneath
this one and his header!

36:58.309 --> 37:00.267
Finds the back of the net!

37:01.761 --> 37:03.308
So you think Liverpool are gonna win?

37:03.346 --> 37:04.643
Yeah.

37:04.848 --> 37:07.397
Well, who's gonna beat them?
- CROWD LAUGHS

37:11.980 --> 37:13.823
That was Hansen heading down.

37:13.857 --> 37:15.359
Thomas miscued.

37:15.400 --> 37:18.529
And Rush played it back
and Whelan fired it

37:18.570 --> 37:20.072
and it came to Molby.

37:20.113 --> 37:21.706
And that's the equalizer!

37:21.740 --> 37:25.495
We just got a bit of momentum
and kept going and going and going.

37:25.535 --> 37:27.629
It was like a journey
that we're on.

37:29.038 --> 37:31.166
And Whelan coming forward...

37:32.834 --> 37:36.134
There it is! Number two!

37:37.380 --> 37:38.597
Rush is in there...

37:38.965 --> 37:40.638
Oh, and it fell to McMahon!

37:41.426 --> 37:43.178
We won 12 and drew the other one

37:43.219 --> 37:45.472
in the last 13 matches
and then we won the double.

37:45.513 --> 37:47.356
And Dalglish is in here.

37:47.390 --> 37:51.611
Yes! The player-manager
scores the goal!

37:52.520 --> 37:56.900
They win the double!
The finest team that we've ever seen!

37:56.941 --> 38:00.115
And then it's...
3-2.

38:03.490 --> 38:04.662
And Dalglish...

38:04.699 --> 38:07.452
And Rush is on the far side.
Is this 3? It is!

38:12.832 --> 38:15.506
You went crazy when we
came off that pitch.

38:15.543 --> 38:17.295
And Liverpool Football Club

38:17.337 --> 38:20.807
have become only
the third team this century

38:20.840 --> 38:24.344
to win the marvelous double
in the same season.

38:31.100 --> 38:35.480
From somewhere he galvanized
the players from really nowhere.

38:39.234 --> 38:41.032
It's one of his greatest
achievements.

38:42.529 --> 38:44.247
Probably the greatest.

38:47.659 --> 38:49.002
Here.

38:49.035 --> 38:51.584
Have a wee sip. Let's see what
that is you're drinking, Lyns.

38:55.834 --> 38:57.131
Good girl.

38:58.545 --> 39:00.388
Oh, yes.

39:01.381 --> 39:03.509
This is what the cameraman
likes to see!

39:04.175 --> 39:06.303
Yes, Dad! Yeah!

39:06.344 --> 39:07.971
Dad does video.

39:13.476 --> 39:15.604
He promised me that when
he finished playing

39:15.645 --> 39:18.489
he had no intentions of doing
anything in football.

39:19.566 --> 39:21.534
Hello!
- Hello?

39:21.568 --> 39:23.115
He didn't know
what he was going to do

39:23.152 --> 39:26.076
and then he was offered
the manager job at Liverpool.

39:27.323 --> 39:30.122
Lynsey, your share's over
beside the rocking horse.

39:30.159 --> 39:31.536
That's all your pressies.

39:32.412 --> 39:34.255
Go and see if there are
any babies over there.

39:34.289 --> 39:36.291
This is the best Christmas ever!

39:37.083 --> 39:39.677
And he'd said to me,
'When I finish playing, that's it for me.'

39:41.337 --> 39:43.556
And he said, 'What will I do
when he's offered us?'

39:43.590 --> 39:46.844
You can't turn the manager of
Liverpool job down.'

39:46.885 --> 39:49.013
Shall I move these?

39:50.471 --> 39:52.690
- Sing, girl.
- No.

39:52.807 --> 39:54.935
♪ Come on Eileen <i>♪</i>

39:54.976 --> 39:56.899
Dexys Midnight Runners!

39:58.688 --> 40:01.066
Corning straight out
of playing into management...

40:02.025 --> 40:04.119
it was difficult for rne because
I loved the dressing room

40:04.152 --> 40:05.870
I loved the banter,
I loved the carry-on.

40:05.904 --> 40:08.202
Have you tried it?
- It's spicy.

40:08.239 --> 40:10.241
I think he was easier
going when he was player

40:10.283 --> 40:11.751
because you were part of a team.

40:11.784 --> 40:14.162
Whereas as the manager,
everything rests on your shoulders.

40:14.203 --> 40:15.329
I think it was different.

40:15.371 --> 40:18.124
It was more stressful as a manager
than what it was as a player.

40:18.166 --> 40:20.464
Well, he won't play anything!

40:20.960 --> 40:22.633
- He's always in bed.
- Even football?

40:22.670 --> 40:25.048
Well, he plays football with Paul
but he's always in bed.

40:25.089 --> 40:28.389
Yes, and he won't play my
Scalextric with me!

40:30.094 --> 40:31.774
That's not been out
for a long time.

40:31.804 --> 40:35.434
Lynsey, you like
Daddy don't you?

40:37.602 --> 40:39.022
Well, there you go!

40:39.023 --> 40:40.818
Definitely when he was managing

40:40.855 --> 40:42.482
you would notice a
change in mood.

40:42.523 --> 40:45.026
It was very rarely to do with
the result of the game.

40:45.068 --> 40:47.696
It was mostly to do with how
the team had played.

40:47.737 --> 40:49.785
If they'd done what he'd
asked them to do

40:49.822 --> 40:52.245
if he'd felt that they'd
given enough on the pitch.

40:52.283 --> 40:54.126
I remember coming back
in the car once

40:54.160 --> 40:57.505
and he was in a really bad mood
and Mum was like

40:57.538 --> 40:58.630
'If that's what you're like
when you've won

40:58.665 --> 41:00.167
imagine what you're like
when you lose!'

41:00.208 --> 41:03.553
And he was like, 'Yeah but this
went wrong and that went wrong.'

41:03.586 --> 41:07.090
It was harder to predict because
it wasn't all about the result.

41:07.966 --> 41:09.468
When he came home, he unwound.

41:09.509 --> 41:10.806
When he came home
with the children

41:10.843 --> 41:12.186
because four kids you come home

41:12.220 --> 41:13.767
and you really can't..,

41:13.805 --> 41:16.979
you can't think of anything else
when you've got four of you.

41:17.016 --> 41:19.394
But you could have
your moments, couldn't you?

41:20.186 --> 41:22.860
You weren't always like
Mr Nice Guy.

41:22.897 --> 41:25.366
I mean, we... we can't
tell lies about you.

41:25.400 --> 41:26.868
You're not always
Mr Nice Guy, are you?

41:26.901 --> 41:28.781
You're not always
a nice person yourself!

41:28.820 --> 41:29.946
Am!

41:31.030 --> 41:33.954
You try your best not to
bring your work home

41:33.992 --> 41:37.166
but I think in football
it's a lot more difficult

41:37.203 --> 41:38.250
not to bring your work home

41:38.287 --> 41:42.337
because everybody else
has brought it into your house.

41:46.713 --> 41:50.763
Kenny, if you don't know him,
can be a very awkward guy.

41:50.800 --> 41:52.643
But, I mean, he's a very
private person

41:52.677 --> 41:55.438
and he's only got time for his family
and people that he really knows.

41:56.889 --> 41:58.687
I mean, he's a nightmare
for the press.

41:59.684 --> 42:03.109
Ideally, he'd like to play
the game of football

42:03.146 --> 42:04.363
and get into his car and
go straight home

42:04.397 --> 42:06.445
and not have to talk to
anybody afterwards.

42:08.067 --> 42:10.695
Obviously, when you stand up
in a press conference

42:10.737 --> 42:12.284
there's a lot of people there

42:12.321 --> 42:14.949
and there's people there
that really you cannae trust

42:14.991 --> 42:17.494
with the words that you're gonna use,
or you'd like to use.

42:17.535 --> 42:19.082
And all you need is one slip
of the tongue

42:19.120 --> 42:22.374
and you get whatever
the quotes you've made

42:22.415 --> 42:24.918
wrongly attributed to you
because they twist them.

42:26.252 --> 42:28.471
The only reason I've come is because
they'll no' tell the truth anyway.

42:28.504 --> 42:30.584
They what, sorry?
- They don't tell the truth anyway.

42:31.049 --> 42:32.767
People are a wee bit
frightened of him.

42:33.676 --> 42:36.930
He growls at people and he's...
he makes people jump.

42:38.181 --> 42:40.183
And that with his knowledge
and that

42:40.224 --> 42:42.602
the fact that he was such
a great player.

42:42.643 --> 42:44.941
I mean, who can argue with him?

42:44.979 --> 42:46.572
You've got to respect that.

42:46.606 --> 42:50.531
Kenny thinks that weakness
is a weakness.

42:50.568 --> 42:53.788
Um, and he ain't for it.

42:54.781 --> 42:57.705
To describe him you'd say
strong character.

42:58.910 --> 43:01.959
In fact, very strong character.

43:03.539 --> 43:06.418
In fact, very, very, very
strong character.

43:07.210 --> 43:09.713
You're called ruthless
but in a nice way.

43:11.089 --> 43:12.341
Well, I don't know about that.

43:12.342 --> 43:14.684
Do you take that as a
compliment or not?

43:14.717 --> 43:16.594
Well, as you say,
I know what I've got to do

43:16.636 --> 43:18.354
and they realise
what I've got to do.

43:18.387 --> 43:21.106
And they realise the importance
I place on them

43:21.140 --> 43:23.268
and they realise the importance
that the decision that I make

43:23.309 --> 43:25.061
is for the club's benefit.

43:25.103 --> 43:27.697
And that's the way it will always
be for rne here.

43:27.730 --> 43:29.528
Some of them were saying as well

43:29.565 --> 43:31.192
that maybe the public have got
the wrong impression of you

43:31.234 --> 43:33.236
through the media,
which isn't your fault obviously

43:33.277 --> 43:34.904
but, uh, you know,
that you are a bit dour.

43:34.946 --> 43:36.448
But we all know...
I mean, I've known you for years

43:36.489 --> 43:38.332
and you've got a cracking
sense of humour.

43:38.366 --> 43:39.959
And you enjoy that, don't you?

43:39.992 --> 43:42.165
Yeah. You've got to have
a laugh, I think.

43:47.291 --> 43:50.761
I think he thinks maybe
somebody's trying to trick him

43:50.795 --> 43:53.844
or trying to coerce him
into a certain answer.

43:53.881 --> 43:56.760
I'm not sure why he's like
that with the media.

43:56.801 --> 43:59.600
I think a lot of his attitude and
commitment was tremendous really.

43:59.637 --> 44:00.637
Erm...

44:01.305 --> 44:03.399
Lawro's playing
out of position and he's...

44:03.432 --> 44:06.060
he's had as good a game
as anybody on the pitch.

44:08.771 --> 44:10.819
But, yeah, he's not like that at all.

44:14.110 --> 44:15.362
He's really, really funny.

44:22.785 --> 44:24.833
Ladies and gentlemen.

44:26.122 --> 44:28.420
That's obviously ladies and gentlemen!

44:31.252 --> 44:32.970
What is it?
- Eh?

44:33.004 --> 44:34.564
What's he saying?
What's he saying then?

44:35.673 --> 44:36.970
I'd like to thank...

44:37.008 --> 44:39.056
I'd like to thank...

44:39.802 --> 44:42.351
I think obviously you
understand that the press

44:43.556 --> 44:46.105
have got a role to play
and they've got a job to do.

44:46.142 --> 44:48.565
But equally, I've got a job to do.

44:48.603 --> 44:50.981
I don't need to try
and do their job for them.

44:51.022 --> 44:53.195
And I don't expect them
to try and do my job

44:53.232 --> 44:57.783
so I protected the players
if they deserved to be protected.

44:59.906 --> 45:01.158
It's working!

45:01.199 --> 45:03.577
Let's see your new pyjamas, come on.

45:03.618 --> 45:05.086
It is working.

45:09.373 --> 45:11.671
You have to make the bed now!
I was sleeping!

45:17.256 --> 45:19.350
I'll always be on my guard
when I make statements

45:19.383 --> 45:20.600
about Liverpool Football Club.

45:20.635 --> 45:23.229
I've got to protect myself
basically to protect the club.

45:23.262 --> 45:25.310
So really are you
saying you're being cautious

45:25.348 --> 45:26.600
as opposed to dour?

45:27.767 --> 45:29.110
I've got to concentrate.

45:29.143 --> 45:32.147
I find it hard to concentrate
and speak at the same time.

45:32.188 --> 45:33.815
Speaking's a big problem for me

45:33.856 --> 45:36.056
and I find the concentration
a bit of a problem as well.

45:36.484 --> 45:39.328
He's intelligent although
he pretends he's stupid.

45:40.029 --> 45:43.704
He could cut interviewers in two
just with his one-liners.

45:44.283 --> 45:46.285
I don't understand him and
he said he's got trouble with me.

45:46.327 --> 45:48.295
Well, it goes both ways!

45:49.538 --> 45:51.290
He is a bit hard to understand

45:51.332 --> 45:52.709
I would think in team meetings
and the like, isn't he?

45:52.750 --> 45:54.548
Pardon?
- He's a bit hard to understand...

45:57.755 --> 45:59.098
Be yourself

45:59.131 --> 46:01.759
because when you
wake up in the morning

46:01.801 --> 46:03.599
you know what you've
said the day before.

46:04.345 --> 46:05.722
And if you know yourself

46:05.763 --> 46:07.481
I think you've got to have
a very good memory

46:07.515 --> 46:09.108
to remember what you've said.

46:09.141 --> 46:11.235
And I never had a
very good memory

46:11.269 --> 46:13.271
so it was no use to me that...

46:13.312 --> 46:14.939
that wasn't an option.

I think they should stick

47:09.869 --> 47:12.213
Terrible.
What do you think, Kenny?

47:12.246 --> 47:13.873
Oh, yeah.

47:14.874 --> 47:17.464
We're thinking
how can we replace Ian Rush?

47:17.465 --> 47:19.428
<i>Rushie was going, he was leaving.</i>

47:20.338 --> 47:21.715
<i>We went out in the market</i>

47:21.756 --> 47:25.226

47:28.137 --> 47:30.686
<i>We had made some changes

47:30.723 --> 47:32.020
This is Venison.

47:33.142 --> 47:34.610
And here's Barnes.

47:34.643 --> 47:36.316
And Aldridge this time. 2-0.

47:36.354 --> 47:38.197
I played for Watford,
which is long ball.

47:38.230 --> 47:39.777
I never thought I'd be a
Liverpool type player.

47:39.815 --> 47:41.783
So obviously Liverpool
sees things in players

47:41.817 --> 47:43.537
that the players don't even
know themselves.

47:44.028 --> 47:45.325
McMahon!

47:45.363 --> 47:47.707
Oh, I say. What a belter.

47:49.033 --> 47:50.580
I expected some indoctrination

47:50.618 --> 47:52.586
on when you first come to find
the “Liverpool way.”

47:52.620 --> 47:53.792
And I remember you saying

47:53.829 --> 47:55.627
'Well, there's an orange
bib and there's a yellow bib.

47:55.664 --> 47:57.424
And just pass to someone
in that orange bib.'

47:58.167 --> 47:59.214
Barnes.

47:59.251 --> 48:01.470
Oh, lovely back heel. McMahon.

48:01.504 --> 48:03.927
Aldridge, good challenge.
Beardsley!

48:03.964 --> 48:07.013
Oh, that's a lovely goal.
That's a lovely goal.

48:07.051 --> 48:09.770
They did have rules on the pitch.

48:09.804 --> 48:12.398
But within those rules...
- The framework, yeah.

48:12.431 --> 48:14.399
You had tremendous
freedom to play.

48:15.643 --> 48:17.361
He had a long time to clear that.

48:17.395 --> 48:19.272
He dwelt on it too long.
Barnes...

48:19.980 --> 48:22.574
And Barnes again. Three.

48:23.943 --> 48:25.866
People talk about time to settle in

48:25.903 --> 48:27.325
and when you talk about time
to settle in

48:27.363 --> 48:30.082
is it three games into the season?
Is it 10 games into the season?

48:30.116 --> 48:31.914
I'm talking about the first week

48:31.951 --> 48:33.498
the first two weeks in
pre-season training

48:33.536 --> 48:36.005
before we'd even played a game,
just being with the lads

48:36.038 --> 48:37.460
just playing football with the lads

48:37.498 --> 48:39.796
the acceptance and, you know,
the camaraderie.

48:39.834 --> 48:43.054
<i>John was an ideal player for us
to go down the touch lines.</i>

48:43.087 --> 48:46.387
<i>Talented, skilful, scored a goal,
made a goal.</i>

48:46.799 --> 48:49.678
He's got Beardsley
going to his left but still Barnes!

48:49.718 --> 48:52.221
That's a fabulous individual goal!

48:52.972 --> 48:54.612
When I picked it up on that
left-hand side

48:54.640 --> 48:56.608
there was only one person
I was looking for.

48:57.977 --> 49:01.277
It's just that one sliding
into the left-hand side

49:01.313 --> 49:04.317
because you know that
he's going to keep it for you.

49:06.861 --> 49:11.241
He could go past people for fun and it
was a really, really exciting time.

49:11.282 --> 49:14.252
Barnes, took on Caesar, still Barnes.

49:14.285 --> 49:15.502
Brilliant.

49:15.536 --> 49:17.584
Houghton couldn't convert.
McMahon...

49:17.621 --> 49:18.964
Three in the way

49:18.998 --> 49:22.127
<i>They knitted so well together, the hunger
and the desire to be successful</i>

49:22.168 --> 49:23.841
<i>was there for everybody to see.</i>

49:24.170 --> 49:25.638
McMahon won that back

49:25.671 --> 49:29.517
Barnes, Beardsley and Aldridge,
you know, they just seemed to gel.

49:29.550 --> 49:31.097
Oh, a goal for Aldridge!

49:31.886 --> 49:34.605
It was intuition.
It was one-touch football.

49:34.638 --> 49:35.810
Beardsley.

49:37.308 --> 49:39.606
Oh, brilliantly done by
Peter Beardsley!

49:42.396 --> 49:44.649
<i>The quality was there for
everybody to see.</i>

49:45.608 --> 49:47.451
<i>They never let go throughout
the whole season.</i>

49:49.028 --> 49:50.871
Nottingham Forest were
a good side at the time

49:50.905 --> 49:52.157
and one of the top three teams
in the country.

49:52.198 --> 49:53.575
Houghton. Barnes.

49:53.616 --> 49:55.084
Houghton goes again.
He's through.

49:56.327 --> 50:00.377
You talk about a 90-minute
performance of not just quality

50:00.414 --> 50:02.054
but of players making
the right decisions.

50:02.625 --> 50:04.502
Finds space and finds Aldridge.

50:06.003 --> 50:10.679
And that is another superb
Liverpool goal.

50:10.716 --> 50:13.469
The performance
the players put on was fantastic.

50:13.511 --> 50:14.683
Working it to Houghton.

50:14.720 --> 50:16.188
Aldridge. Gillespie!

50:17.056 --> 50:21.061
They had great determination that
they wanted to play well for 90 minutes.

50:21.062 --> 50:23.358
Barnes against Chettle.

50:26.565 --> 50:28.238
Look at Barnes here.

50:28.275 --> 50:29.527
They're waiting for the pull back.

50:29.568 --> 50:31.036
Beardsley!

50:31.070 --> 50:34.700
Oh! A glorious goal again.

50:34.740 --> 50:37.835
We played the game as if it
was 0-0 when we were 5-0 up.

50:38.452 --> 50:41.877
And Beardsley
and Spackman and Aldridge! It's 5!

50:44.083 --> 50:47.678
That's the finest exhibition
I've seen in the whole time

50:47.711 --> 50:51.466
I've played and watched the game.
It was absolutely tremendous.

50:51.507 --> 50:54.852
Corning from Shankly's
favourite player, Sir Torn Finney.

50:54.885 --> 50:57.513
We all went back to the pub
that night and we're going

50:57.555 --> 51:01.103
'Do you think we'll ever see a team
performance as good as that?'

51:01.104 --> 51:03.353
Everybody kept asking
about the secret.

51:04.103 --> 51:06.276
I'll tell you what I think the secret is.

51:06.313 --> 51:08.566
Everybody that's got a job to do,
does it well.

51:09.149 --> 51:11.072
Hello, Paul!
- Oh, Pedro!

51:11.235 --> 51:12.612
What are you eating?

51:12.653 --> 51:14.075
Eat with your mouth closed!

51:14.113 --> 51:15.990
Smile, you're on candid camera!

51:16.031 --> 51:17.031
Say hello!

51:18.576 --> 51:20.624
Hello, Bruce!

51:21.245 --> 51:23.043
Congratulations!

51:23.080 --> 51:25.708
What for?
- What for?

51:25.749 --> 51:28.093
He's not pregnant,
he just put the...

51:28.127 --> 51:29.845
Did you think I was pregnant?

51:32.965 --> 51:34.638
So we're coming to see you soon.

51:34.675 --> 51:36.598
Have you looked your doors
and changed your looks?

51:36.635 --> 51:39.309
They're coming
straight from my house.

51:41.765 --> 51:45.019
Ooh, we might have to go because
the food's gonna be here in three minutes.

51:45.060 --> 51:47.813
Good!

51:48.230 --> 51:50.324
Bye!
- Miss you!

51:50.357 --> 51:52.405
They didn't let rne in the picture.
Bye!

51:52.443 --> 51:54.070
Bye, Paul, bye bye.

51:54.111 --> 51:56.034
Bye!

52:10.127 --> 52:12.346
I don't think he's ever
let rne win at anything.

52:14.882 --> 52:17.601
Even from a young age
I've always had to earn it.

52:18.260 --> 52:19.227
I'll take that.

52:19.228 --> 52:21.893
That's why maybe
I am the way I am.

52:21.930 --> 52:23.648
It's in the water.

52:23.682 --> 52:26.059
<i>In life you don't just get
things given to you, do you?</i>

52:26.060 --> 52:28.313
No pressure.
- No.

52:28.354 --> 52:29.822
<i>You've got to earn it.</i>

52:29.855 --> 52:31.949
<i>So what's the point
making it simple for him?</i>

52:33.651 --> 52:35.278
Oh, there we go.

52:35.319 --> 52:37.572
I expect to win. I need to win.

52:39.865 --> 52:42.709
There's no times that you can lose
that don't feel bad.

52:43.410 --> 52:45.333
Do you know you're not allowed
to do that after you've started?

52:45.371 --> 52:46.714
I know that.

52:47.831 --> 52:50.755
That's probably something
I got from him

52:50.793 --> 52:53.387
from even playing golf
against him.

52:54.296 --> 52:55.816
You must be in the bushes, Paul.

52:56.548 --> 52:58.516
Nice to see him help me
look for my ball.

52:59.009 --> 53:01.011
Playing now, there's just
that ruthlessness

53:01.053 --> 53:03.101
to always be successful.

53:03.847 --> 53:06.100
I'm even more pleased that
I think you've lost it.

53:09.144 --> 53:10.646
Where did it go?

53:12.439 --> 53:17.161
There was a company from Italy
called Pantofola D'Oro

53:17.194 --> 53:18.912
and they used to make these boots

53:18.946 --> 53:22.200
but they were... you got them
custom ordered if you...

53:22.241 --> 53:23.458
they put, like...

53:23.492 --> 53:25.870
'Which colour do you want this bit?'
Which colour do you want this bit?'

53:25.911 --> 53:27.413
'What type of leather do
you want this bit?'

53:27.454 --> 53:31.129
'What sole?' They were beautiful,
like, amazing boots.

53:32.126 --> 53:34.595
So when I was playing they said,
'Oh, we wanna give you boots.'

53:34.628 --> 53:37.632
And there was no money
but they'd give us boots.

53:37.673 --> 53:41.177
So I got these boots
with a little bit of red on them.

53:42.344 --> 53:44.392
And I'm telling you it was like...

53:45.222 --> 53:47.645
a little bit...
like, a little bit of red.

53:48.517 --> 53:52.738
And he said, 'You must be some
player, you, with red on your boots.

53:52.771 --> 53:54.694
Why don't you bring attention to yourself

53:54.732 --> 53:56.951
by the way you play,
not by the way you look?'

53:57.359 --> 53:59.703
Do you remember that?
- No.

54:00.446 --> 54:02.949
One of my best friends
growing up was a guy called Gavin Jones

54:02.990 --> 54:04.663
and his dad Eddie Jones.

54:04.700 --> 54:08.204
My dad said, 'Come on, Eddie,
we'll take on the kids.'

54:08.996 --> 54:10.043
High.

54:10.789 --> 54:12.336
Gav hits a shot...

54:12.374 --> 54:13.626
Go on.

54:13.667 --> 54:15.761
It might still be you.

54:16.503 --> 54:19.803
'Well done, Paul, well done, Gav.'

54:21.425 --> 54:22.802
You are getting nothing!

54:24.845 --> 54:27.849
Three or four holes in
Gav hits a putt.

54:28.849 --> 54:31.102
Maybe a 6 or 7-footer, goes in.

54:32.269 --> 54:35.113
'Well done, son. Great putt.'

54:35.147 --> 54:40.199
'Eddie, what do you mean
“well done”?'

54:40.235 --> 54:41.908
He said, 'We're one down.'

54:41.945 --> 54:44.198
He said, 'Do you wanna win?!'

54:44.239 --> 54:45.912
He said, 'No more “well dones.”'

54:46.700 --> 54:48.247
<i>I don't think you can get
through your life</i>

54:48.285 --> 54:49.332
<i>without being competitive.</i>

54:50.204 --> 54:52.627
There's not been a hole halved Paul.
- No.

54:52.664 --> 54:55.383
You've won three. I've won three.

54:59.922 --> 55:02.391
Will you give me that?
- Aye, I'll give you that.

55:02.424 --> 55:03.926
I got that?
- I said I'll give you a half!

55:03.967 --> 55:06.095
I wasn't even trying it!

55:06.136 --> 55:07.433
I'll take that!

55:07.471 --> 55:10.315
Anything that he was
involved in, he wanted to win.

55:10.349 --> 55:14.104
The grandkids have made him soft!
I'll take it!

55:14.144 --> 55:17.273
He enjoyed nothing more than winning.

55:24.071 --> 55:27.496
It's weird how things
have gone full circle.

55:27.533 --> 55:30.286
There you go, in there.
Don't touch anything.

55:30.327 --> 55:32.580
I wanted to shout at him,
'Stay off the pitch!'

55:32.621 --> 55:36.000
'Don't touch anything in the office!'
Because that was my childhood.

55:36.500 --> 55:38.343
I get to sit on this side now.

55:38.585 --> 55:41.384
I know.
- He's not changed a bit.

55:42.339 --> 55:44.499
Mind you, it was only last week
that picture was taken.

55:45.717 --> 55:47.515
I don't even think I get a mention.

55:48.303 --> 55:50.476
Do I get a mention in this one?
- I don't know.

55:50.514 --> 55:52.061
It's all... you should be
able to...

55:52.099 --> 55:53.726
You should be able to
get through that book.

55:53.767 --> 55:55.064
It's all pictures.

55:55.102 --> 55:57.275
Here's another one.
How many have you made?

55:57.312 --> 55:59.781
Are you struggling for cash?
Is that you as well?

55:59.815 --> 56:01.442
Yeah!

56:03.485 --> 56:05.908
When he was a young
manager at my age

56:05.946 --> 56:08.369
I would go with him

56:08.407 --> 56:11.661
to training and maybe boot
a ball off the wall or...

56:11.702 --> 56:13.875
and I'm watching him booting balls.

56:16.748 --> 56:20.594
For rne to have my dad here,
there's a comfort that comes with it

56:20.627 --> 56:24.131
and maybe one day he'll say
something nice, I don't know.

56:25.132 --> 56:26.805
<i>I was lucky.</i>

56:26.842 --> 56:29.846
<i>I started at one of the most
successful clubs in the world</i>

56:29.887 --> 56:31.480
<i>and met great people
working there.</i>

56:31.513 --> 56:34.983
<i>Paul's had to start a bit
lower than that</i>

56:35.017 --> 56:36.690
<i>but it's not been easy for him.</i>

56:36.727 --> 56:39.526
<i>A lot of people have had a problem
with him because of his name.</i>

56:41.273 --> 56:43.401
<i>He was a brave boy to go
down that road</i>

56:43.442 --> 56:45.365
<i>and try and make a career out of it.</i>

56:47.696 --> 56:49.448
<i>I was pretty nervous
at the game.</i>

56:51.533 --> 56:53.410
It doesn't matter how old you get

56:53.452 --> 56:55.750
or how much success you have

56:55.787 --> 56:57.789
you always want the approval
of your dad.

56:59.958 --> 57:03.258
He's given his heart and
soul to Liverpool.

57:04.129 --> 57:06.803
His loyalty to the club is
unquestioned.

57:08.759 --> 57:11.763
Whatever he means to Liverpool

57:11.803 --> 57:14.647
isn't close to what Liverpool
means to him.

57:15.515 --> 57:18.359
I couldn't believe it when I got this job

57:18.393 --> 57:20.987
and Bruce Grobbelaar's
the goalkeeper coach.

57:21.980 --> 57:23.607
He was a team-mate of my dad's.

57:24.232 --> 57:28.487
He was a hero of mine and
he played for my dad.

57:29.696 --> 57:35.544
I've got 96 on my back,
I've got 96 on my training shoes.

57:36.703 --> 57:41.334
It's in all of us that were a part
of the Hillsborough tragedy.

57:42.626 --> 57:47.006
Hillsborough is just not
something we ever discuss.

57:48.423 --> 57:51.677
I count myself lucky that
we all came home.

57:52.386 --> 57:58.064
I almost feel guilty about talking about it
because we were the lucky ones.

57:59.309 --> 58:02.358
96 will always be in all our lives.

58:03.897 --> 58:08.619
Wherever you go in football,
everybody knows about 96.

58:10.570 --> 58:13.699
It's something that I've
probably never really dealt with.

58:16.076 --> 58:18.078
I've never spoken to my dad about it.

58:45.022 --> 58:46.649
Hillsborough was a famous ground.

58:48.150 --> 58:53.998
It had been used many times
in the past for semi-finals.

58:54.906 --> 58:59.878
We'd played Notts Forest there
and we had a good result there

58:59.911 --> 59:01.431
so we were looking forward
to the game.

59:13.717 --> 59:15.560
We just had a normal Friday.

59:15.594 --> 59:19.349
Trained in the morning,
had our lunch.

59:20.057 --> 59:24.779
We just pottered over to prepare
for the game the next day.

59:25.937 --> 59:30.317
Got there on time for our dinner
half six, seven o'clock at night.

59:32.235 --> 59:34.329
Normal preparation, really.

59:34.362 --> 59:36.330
Same as we did for most
away games

59:36.364 --> 59:37.364
if not all of them.

59:53.965 --> 59:56.138
I just know that there was
a lot of people

59:56.176 --> 01:00:00.022
that went to that game,
that never came home.

01:01:18.258 --> 01:01:19.259
<i>I don't want to go back.</i>

01:01:19.301 --> 01:01:21.019
<i>I don't want those memories</i>

01:01:21.052 --> 01:01:22.725
<i>to come back to the forefront
of my mind.</i>

01:01:22.762 --> 01:01:26.232
<i>So people might say
'You're running away from it.</i> '

01:01:26.266 --> 01:01:30.396
<i>Well, if I am, I am, but at the end of
the clay, it still won't get me back.</i>

01:01:32.063 --> 01:01:33.235
<i>No. Not me.</i>

01:01:58.840 --> 01:02:04.062
We saw the crowds
start to move to the side

01:02:04.095 --> 01:02:06.143
and we saw that people
were coming over the fence.

01:02:06.181 --> 01:02:08.479
We started to see that happening.

01:02:08.516 --> 01:02:11.861
And I vividly remember Mum
turning to the press box

01:02:11.895 --> 01:02:15.240
that was right next to us
and I remember her saying

01:02:15.273 --> 01:02:19.244
'My God, this isn't trouble.
This is something really terrible.'

01:02:32.666 --> 01:02:35.886
I saw Bruce start getting
agitated in the goal

01:02:35.919 --> 01:02:37.959
and then there were people
coming over the barriers.

01:02:38.964 --> 01:02:42.059
We're kind of in seats
but watching what's going on.

01:02:42.092 --> 01:02:45.517
And it was...
watching it all unfold was...

01:02:45.553 --> 01:02:47.806
you didn't really understand
the magnitude of it.

01:03:03.571 --> 01:03:06.575
There are fans on the
pitch here in the six-yard area.

01:03:06.616 --> 01:03:08.710
The referee's going to have
to stop the game.

01:03:08.743 --> 01:03:10.586
There's an overflow behind the goal...

01:03:16.001 --> 01:03:20.097
I turned around,
I ran towards the referee

01:03:20.130 --> 01:03:22.508
and I saw the policeman
coming across the field

01:03:22.549 --> 01:03:24.551
and that's when they called
the game off.

01:04:00.128 --> 01:04:02.381
<i>There was people
helping other people</i>

01:04:02.464 --> 01:04:05.299
<i>who unfortunately
had been injured</i>

01:04:05.300 --> 01:04:06.597
<i>or even worse than that.</i>

01:04:08.887 --> 01:04:10.981
<i>At ground level
we couldn't see much</i>

01:04:11.014 --> 01:04:13.174
<i>because of the number of bodies
that were on the pitch.</i>

01:04:14.684 --> 01:04:15.856
I have no way of knowing

01:04:15.894 --> 01:04:18.738
how many casualties we have here,
but they are considerable.

01:04:21.858 --> 01:04:25.328
There are ambulances
on the arena.

01:04:28.031 --> 01:04:32.411
First aid treatment is being applied
to people on the ground as I speak.

01:04:42.045 --> 01:04:45.049
<i>The fans were tremendously helpful.</i>

01:04:46.633 --> 01:04:48.476
<i>I think they were the first to react.</i>

01:04:49.094 --> 01:04:50.437
Advertising hoardings

01:04:50.470 --> 01:04:52.347
are being used as
emergency stretchers.

01:04:52.389 --> 01:04:55.859
And there are clearly a number
of fans seriously injured.

01:05:01.481 --> 01:05:04.906
<i>There was people on the pitch
doing their level best</i>

01:05:04.943 --> 01:05:07.287
<i>to try and help someone
who was in need of help.</i>

01:05:08.947 --> 01:05:13.327
<i>We had nae much of an idea
how bad it actually was.</i>

01:05:14.494 --> 01:05:18.544
Possibly the biggest tragedy ever seen

01:05:18.581 --> 01:05:20.834
on an English football ground.

01:05:25.338 --> 01:05:28.467
There is terrible emotional scenes going on

01:05:28.508 --> 01:05:32.354
because people are checking to see if
their nearest and dearest are in fact safe.

01:05:37.100 --> 01:05:38.602
We lost Paul.

01:05:40.103 --> 01:05:43.152
Paul always went with his friends.

01:05:45.525 --> 01:05:48.779
At that minute,
all I worried about was my son.

01:05:50.947 --> 01:05:54.201
<i>Paul had to enter through
the Leppings Lane end</i>

01:05:54.242 --> 01:05:56.745
<i>to walk round to go to
the main stand.</i>

01:05:58.955 --> 01:06:04.462
<i>Your concern obviously was for him
to start with to see if he was alright.</i>

01:06:08.047 --> 01:06:10.721
I would think although
he was getting pulled by everyone

01:06:10.758 --> 01:06:14.888
to say and do things, his number one
would be looking for Paul.

01:06:25.315 --> 01:06:27.409
They asked us to go and
say a few words

01:06:27.442 --> 01:06:30.161
over the tannoy
to the supporters.

01:06:37.911 --> 01:06:40.380
I remember then hearing
my dad's voice

01:06:40.413 --> 01:06:42.586
coming over the speaker system

01:06:44.125 --> 01:06:48.426
And it was almost like...
I only wanted my dad then.

01:06:59.057 --> 01:07:01.526
And then he was there...

01:07:01.559 --> 01:07:03.232
like, just there.

01:07:24.582 --> 01:07:27.802
<i>I remember the fans going
to get the newspaper</i>

01:07:27.835 --> 01:07:31.009
<i>and ripping it off the newspaper
stands and burning it.</i>

01:07:31.047 --> 01:07:32.344
<i>Erm...</i>

01:07:33.132 --> 01:07:36.636
<i>Then I got a phone call
from Kelvin Mackenzie.</i>

01:07:39.055 --> 01:07:41.649
<i>And he said,
'We made</i> a <i>mess of this.</i> '

01:07:43.351 --> 01:07:44.694
<i>I said, 'I think so.'</i>

01:07:45.186 --> 01:07:49.898
<i>He says, 'Can we do anything to help?'</i>

01:07:49.899 --> 01:07:53.153
<i>I said, 'Well, I don't know
if it will help</i>

01:07:53.194 --> 01:07:57.870
<i>but I would suggest you start
by putting a headline "THE TRUTH"</i>

01:07:57.907 --> 01:08:01.662
<i>and just put it in tomorrow's
paper saying "WE LIED".'</i>

01:08:02.453 --> 01:08:05.172
<i>He says, 'I cannae do that.'
I said, 'I cannae help you.'</i>

01:08:08.876 --> 01:08:12.631
<i>I dread to think what
it would have been like in the homes</i>

01:08:12.672 --> 01:08:15.221
<i>of some of the people
who lost someone.</i>

01:08:16.801 --> 01:08:19.850
<i>You speak about the family values.</i>

01:08:21.055 --> 01:08:25.935
<i>You speak about helping people
less fortunate than yourself</i>

01:08:25.977 --> 01:08:28.479
<i>or helping people when
they need a bit of help.</i>

01:08:29.397 --> 01:08:30.899
<i>That's all we did.</i>

01:08:30.939 --> 01:08:33.318
<i>We only did what somebody
else would have done for us</i>

01:08:33.359 --> 01:08:34.781
<i>and what...</i>

01:08:34.819 --> 01:08:37.913
<i>They were football fans, they went
to support the football club.</i>

01:08:37.947 --> 01:08:41.667
<i>Now it was the football club's turn
to support their families.</i>

01:08:47.749 --> 01:08:50.218
What he and Marina must
have gone through

01:08:50.251 --> 01:08:52.345
of going to so many funerals

01:08:53.171 --> 01:08:57.596
the pain of what he'd witnessed,
what he'd been through

01:08:57.634 --> 01:09:00.308
in the light also of Heysel

01:09:00.345 --> 01:09:04.816
to now be the primary
spokesperson

01:09:04.849 --> 01:09:08.399
for a club, all the weight
fell on him.

01:09:10.354 --> 01:09:12.357
Going to the funerals
and hearing these stories

01:09:12.398 --> 01:09:15.322
about these people whose
lives had ended

01:09:15.359 --> 01:09:19.456
these kids who had lost parents,
parents who had lost children.

01:09:19.488 --> 01:09:24.495
He never dealt with absorbing
any of that information

01:09:24.535 --> 01:09:30.383
because he felt that his need was so
much lower down than everyone else's.

01:09:42.011 --> 01:09:44.639
<i>On the Monday we went
back to Sheffield.</i>

01:09:44.680 --> 01:09:47.104
<i>We went to the hospital to
see how people are</i>

01:09:47.104 --> 01:09:51.526
<i>and maybe even hopefully
it helped them a little bit.</i>

01:09:51.562 --> 01:09:53.109
<i>The people that we could help.</i>

01:09:54.649 --> 01:09:58.825
There was, urn, a woman.

01:09:59.696 --> 01:10:04.702
Her 14-year-old son, um,
was on a life support machine

01:10:04.742 --> 01:10:08.497
They wanted to turn it off but
she wanted us to get there

01:10:08.538 --> 01:10:10.916
to say goodbye to him.
Oh.

01:10:10.957 --> 01:10:15.383
Well, is there anything in life
that prepares you for that?

01:10:21.843 --> 01:10:24.312
<i>When something happens</i>

01:10:24.345 --> 01:10:26.894
<i>and it's something
that you're involved in</i>

01:10:26.931 --> 01:10:29.605
<i>it's fantastic the way people
get together.</i>

01:10:29.642 --> 01:10:34.193
<i>And as we said before,
the city of Liverpool can be totally proud</i>

01:10:34.230 --> 01:10:37.734
<i>of what they did in the aftermath
of Hillsborough as well.</i>

01:10:38.568 --> 01:10:43.739
It is a great tribute
to the whole of this city

01:10:43.740 --> 01:10:48.792
to its commitment to
the great sport of football

01:10:48.828 --> 01:10:54.130
but most of all of love
amongst good friends.

01:10:56.294 --> 01:11:00.470
<i>So they decided to open up
Anfield to the fans</i>

01:11:00.506 --> 01:11:05.683
<i>which was an unbelievable idea</i>

01:11:05.720 --> 01:11:08.940
<i>and hugely appreciated
by the fans.</i>

01:11:08.973 --> 01:11:10.816
<i>It gave them a focal point.</i>

01:11:14.228 --> 01:11:16.196
They had nowhere to go.
They just...

01:11:16.230 --> 01:11:20.576
So they came to Liverpool because
they had nowhere else to go.

01:11:21.486 --> 01:11:23.534
I remember the first day
I went in there

01:11:23.571 --> 01:11:25.790
and there was a guy that
came up to rne and he said

01:11:25.823 --> 01:11:29.418
'Al, he was 17.

01:11:29.452 --> 01:11:32.579
He was 17. And he was taken
away from rne.'

01:11:32.580 --> 01:11:38.303
And so I'm thinking to myself,
I've got a son that was 8 at the time.

01:11:38.920 --> 01:11:44.927
You just imagine that your son's 17
and what life would be like.

01:11:53.100 --> 01:11:59.198
<i>I went to the Kop with Kelly and Paul,
I think, on the last day</i>

01:12:00.233 --> 01:12:02.861
<i>before everything was
moved</i> away.

01:12:03.986 --> 01:12:05.988
<i>That's the only time
I've been in the Kop.</i>

01:12:07.573 --> 01:12:10.668
We wanted to go in.
It felt like the right thing to do.

01:12:10.701 --> 01:12:12.248
It felt like...

01:12:12.286 --> 01:12:16.291
for no real reason
that's easy to explain

01:12:16.332 --> 01:12:18.084
we wanted to go in.

01:12:20.461 --> 01:12:25.934
<i>It was unbelievable the messages
of support on the Kop</i>

01:12:25.967 --> 01:12:29.597
<i>like, just little messages where
somebody... and it was almost like...</i>

01:12:29.637 --> 01:12:31.605
<i>I know it was a standing area</i>

01:12:31.639 --> 01:12:35.109
<i>but it was almost as if it was,
'Well, that's your space.'</i>

01:12:35.977 --> 01:12:38.981
<i>Right, without a number
or without any recognition on it</i>

01:12:39.021 --> 01:12:40.694
<i>other than just a normal thing.</i>

01:12:40.731 --> 01:12:44.031
<i>'He's here week in, week out';
'he always stands there';</i>

01:12:44.068 --> 01:12:47.072
<i>'The boy next to him played football,
he left a pair of boots. '</i>

01:12:47.113 --> 01:12:50.788
<i>'He had an orange, he always had an
orange at half time, he left an orange.'</i>

01:12:50.825 --> 01:12:53.328
<i>It was unbelievable.</i>

01:12:54.704 --> 01:12:56.798
<i>The messages from the punters</i>

01:12:56.831 --> 01:12:59.459
<i>to the people who stood around
about and in and around them.</i>

01:13:02.920 --> 01:13:06.049
The minute I walked on the Kop
and I saw the tribute on the pitch

01:13:06.090 --> 01:13:07.933
and I wanted to take...

01:13:07.967 --> 01:13:10.971
like, I had a little Celtic teddy bear
and a Liverpool teddy bear

01:13:11.012 --> 01:13:14.642
and I wanted to... I wanted to
leave that at Anfield.

01:13:14.682 --> 01:13:17.686
And I'd had it from when
I was younger.

01:13:20.688 --> 01:13:26.695
I think taking us on to the Kop
and seeing the scarves tied there

01:13:26.736 --> 01:13:29.159
and seeing messages written
on the barriers

01:13:29.196 --> 01:13:32.621
to people who were
no longer there

01:13:32.658 --> 01:13:34.956
and would never stand there
again from their friends

01:13:34.994 --> 01:13:36.587
and from their families

01:13:36.621 --> 01:13:39.420
I think it sunk in for Dad as well.

01:13:39.457 --> 01:13:42.131
And I think it became...

01:13:42.168 --> 01:13:45.547
you know, more even
than standing on the Kop

01:13:45.588 --> 01:13:48.137
and looking out over that
carpet of flowers

01:13:48.174 --> 01:13:51.178
it was the small details of it.

01:13:51.218 --> 01:13:56.975
It was seeing people's names and
realizing that this was about individuals.

01:13:58.851 --> 01:14:02.651
I went to where I stood on the Kop
with my Dad and my sister

01:14:02.688 --> 01:14:07.990
just looking and just broke down
and cried in my Dad's arms.

01:14:08.027 --> 01:14:12.498
It was the moment maybe that I needed
to kind of release everything I'd seen

01:14:12.531 --> 01:14:14.454
as I didn't know how to deal
with it as a child.

01:14:15.660 --> 01:14:17.287
No, they wanted to go.

01:14:18.829 --> 01:14:20.172
<i>Er...</i>

01:14:21.666 --> 01:14:23.293
I wanted to take them.

01:14:28.506 --> 01:14:29.849
<i>So...</i>

01:14:30.758 --> 01:14:31.725
It was...

01:14:31.759 --> 01:14:34.228
for them it was really sad,
for us it was sad

01:14:34.229 --> 01:14:36.723
but it...

01:14:37.473 --> 01:14:39.100
it's just something that...

01:14:40.643 --> 01:14:42.361
er, it had to be done.

01:14:57.284 --> 01:14:59.582
<i>The people who were gonna decide</i>

01:15:00.371 --> 01:15:03.295
<i>if we were going back to play</i>

01:15:03.332 --> 01:15:05.426
<i>first and foremost
were the families.</i>

01:15:07.169 --> 01:15:11.925
<i>You could really sense
the desire of the players</i>

01:15:11.966 --> 01:15:13.718
<i>to go and get a result.</i>

01:15:14.301 --> 01:15:16.269
CROWD ROARS

01:15:34.321 --> 01:15:35.948
- Dad?
- OK.

01:15:35.990 --> 01:15:37.663
Dad?
- OK.

01:15:39.744 --> 01:15:41.212
Hi!

01:15:44.498 --> 01:15:46.421
There was a lot going on
that no one knew about

01:15:46.459 --> 01:15:48.211
and he wouldn't tell anyone.

01:15:48.335 --> 01:15:50.383
But he was falling apart
after Hillsborough.

01:15:57.303 --> 01:16:01.149
<i>By the time it gets to Everton
in the Cup and...</i>

01:16:03.684 --> 01:16:05.732
<i>I knew there was something
building up.</i>

01:16:07.980 --> 01:16:10.358
He was terrible
to live with, really horrible.

01:16:10.399 --> 01:16:12.276
And with the children
he was snappy

01:16:12.318 --> 01:16:14.446
so I would manage to keep
them out the way.

01:16:15.029 --> 01:16:16.997
Lynsey, don't tear it off!

01:16:24.121 --> 01:16:26.715
He wasn't sleeping,
he was taking sleeping pills.

01:16:26.749 --> 01:16:28.046
He couldn't get to sleep at night.

01:16:28.084 --> 01:16:30.507
He had a rash all over his body.

01:16:30.544 --> 01:16:32.171
And he doesn't tell people this.

01:16:32.213 --> 01:16:35.934
You know, he waits until
it all comes to a head.

01:16:41.013 --> 01:16:46.065
<i>I was gonna make a change
during the game defensively.</i>

01:16:46.435 --> 01:16:47.732
Cottee!

01:16:49.897 --> 01:16:51.194
3-3!

01:16:53.359 --> 01:16:56.283
<i>And Ronnie and Roy went,
'I'm not so sure.'</i>

01:16:56.320 --> 01:16:57.867
<i>And I Went 'OK, OK.'</i>

01:17:01.242 --> 01:17:02.585
Barnes!

01:17:02.618 --> 01:17:05.713
He looks for goal and finds it!

01:17:05.746 --> 01:17:08.215
And when he realised
he couldn't make a decision

01:17:08.249 --> 01:17:11.879
he didn't feel like he was the
manager Liverpool deserved.

01:17:12.795 --> 01:17:14.217
Tony Cottee!

01:17:15.506 --> 01:17:17.554
Well, I can't believe this, Martin.

01:17:17.591 --> 01:17:19.259
When all Kenny Dalglish

01:17:19.260 --> 01:17:22.389
would have wanted was
his team to defend properly

01:17:22.429 --> 01:17:24.523
and they go and commit
something like this.

01:17:25.224 --> 01:17:27.272
It's been quite magnificent.

01:17:27.309 --> 01:17:30.062
It's been a night to shake
the soul really.

01:17:30.729 --> 01:17:33.323
<i>If I cannae make decisions</i>

01:17:36.402 --> 01:17:39.952
<i>I said to myself, 'I've got to go.</i> '

01:17:47.288 --> 01:17:51.964
I regret to announce that
Kenny Dalglish told the board yesterday

01:17:52.001 --> 01:17:53.628
of his wish to retire as team manager.

01:17:56.505 --> 01:17:58.348
I don't think it ever
got easier for Kenny.

01:17:58.349 --> 01:17:59.933
I think it got worse.

01:18:02.261 --> 01:18:05.105
He would never, ever admit
that Hillsborough

01:18:05.139 --> 01:18:07.733
had anything to do with anything
because that's the way he is.

01:18:10.144 --> 01:18:13.273
Only Kenny can tell us

01:18:13.314 --> 01:18:15.612
what that journey was really like.

01:18:17.568 --> 01:18:20.287
What I do know is that the stress

01:18:20.321 --> 01:18:23.450
and strain of that
must have been at times intolerable.

01:18:35.920 --> 01:18:37.797
In the aftermath of Hillsborough

01:18:37.838 --> 01:18:41.763
it has taken the families
two decades

01:18:41.800 --> 01:18:43.677
to set the record straight.

01:18:46.055 --> 01:18:48.274
Marina and Kenny Dalglish

01:18:48.307 --> 01:18:53.029
were real humanitarians
in the face of dreadful adversity.

01:18:54.021 --> 01:18:57.571
People turning up literally
on their doorstep.

01:18:58.984 --> 01:19:03.581
And that's why they are
so respected

01:19:05.991 --> 01:19:07.493
in our city.

01:19:08.494 --> 01:19:10.963
They know what they sacrificed
and what they gave.

01:19:12.623 --> 01:19:17.129
Today we take the
unprecedented step of granting

01:19:17.169 --> 01:19:22.391
the freedom of the city
posthumously to the 96 individuals.

01:19:27.388 --> 01:19:32.269
Sisters Sarah Louise Hicks
and Victoria Jane Hicks.

01:19:33.102 --> 01:19:37.733
Kenny had been a part of our lives
before I actually met him

01:19:37.773 --> 01:19:41.573
on that day back in April 1989.

01:19:42.027 --> 01:19:45.531
Kenneth Mathieson Dalglish.

01:19:46.365 --> 01:19:49.869
Kenny has been a part of my journey

01:19:49.910 --> 01:19:52.584
from the beginning of losing
both my daughters.

01:19:53.580 --> 01:19:55.378
Marina Dalglish.

01:19:56.417 --> 01:20:00.092
Sarah had had Kenny Dalglish
albums every Christmas

01:20:00.129 --> 01:20:02.678
for years when she was little.

01:20:08.220 --> 01:20:10.723
He's the King of Anfield, really.

01:20:11.724 --> 01:20:13.317
But I don't look at him like that.

01:20:13.350 --> 01:20:16.069
I just look at him as a dear man.

01:20:18.022 --> 01:20:19.649
And we've adopted Kenny now.

01:20:19.690 --> 01:20:21.363
You know, he's not going back
to Glasgow.

01:20:21.400 --> 01:20:22.947
We won't let him.

01:20:31.368 --> 01:20:33.291

Show us what
you do on the slopes, Dad!

01:24:06.833 --> 01:24:08.551
Someone said to me
when I was really little

01:24:08.585 --> 01:24:10.212
'What does your Dad do?'

01:24:13.298 --> 01:24:17.098
I mean, he stands in a little box on
a Saturday and he points and shouts.'

01:24:17.427 --> 01:24:19.304
Which to be fair is a
fair assessment.

01:24:48.709 --> 01:24:50.962
Two fingers, Dad!
Woo!

01:25:14.109 --> 01:25:16.111
Speak into the camera.

01:25:16.153 --> 01:25:17.655
Hello.

01:25:17.696 --> 01:25:21.166
Say, 'Hello, Father Christmas.'
- Hello, Father Christmas!

01:25:30.083 --> 01:25:31.551
Are you happy with
your pressies, troops?

01:25:31.585 --> 01:25:33.758
Yeah.
- Yeah.

01:25:33.795 --> 01:25:35.297
What's your favourite one, Lyns?

01:25:35.339 --> 01:25:36.886
Baby, Dad.

01:25:51.980 --> 01:25:53.402
Look at that.

01:25:57.361 --> 01:25:59.121

to the nightclub, Mum

01:25:59.154 --> 01:26:00.576
