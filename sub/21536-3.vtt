WEBVTT

00:03.503 --> 00:05.005
- PREVIOUSLY ON<i>MILLION DOLLAR</i>
<i>LISTING NEW YORK...</i>

00:05.038 --> 00:06.473
- MICHAEL.
I LOST THE APARTMENT.

00:06.506 --> 00:07.707
- YOU'VE LOST IT.

00:07.741 --> 00:09.809
- SO BASICALLY
I'M HOMELESS.

00:09.843 --> 00:11.811
- WELCOME TO 1055.

00:11.845 --> 00:14.481
- GETTING MY NAME ON A LISTING
IN TREVOR'S NEW BUILDING

00:14.514 --> 00:15.749
IS A MAJOR COUP FOR ME.

00:15.782 --> 00:18.151
- MY BUYER LOVED 1055 PARK.

00:18.184 --> 00:19.386
- I'M SO PSYCHED.

00:19.419 --> 00:22.088
- HE JUST TOLD ME
HE DID $100 MILLION THIS YEAR.

00:22.122 --> 00:24.190
- REALLY?
I DID A BILLION.

00:24.224 --> 00:26.826
- FREDRIK IS A SHARK,
AND HE DOES WHAT SHARKS DO.

00:26.860 --> 00:27.861
HE SMELLS BLOOD.

00:27.894 --> 00:29.195
- I'LL GIVE YOU MY CARD.

00:29.229 --> 00:32.932
IN THE EVENT YOU WANT
TO ACTUALLY SELL THE APARTMENT

00:32.966 --> 00:35.068
AND NOT JUST LIST IT.

00:38.338 --> 00:40.240
- MY MOTTO IS EXPANSION.

00:40.273 --> 00:45.078
ALWAYS IN ALL WAYS.

00:45.111 --> 00:46.479
- I COME FROM
A REAL ESTATE FAMILY,

00:46.513 --> 00:48.648
BUT GUESS YOU CAN CALL ME
THE NEW KID ON THE BLOCK.

00:48.682 --> 00:51.284
- I'M THE CLOSER
AND A LISTING MACHINE.

00:51.317 --> 00:52.452
WHAT MAKES ME BETTER

00:52.485 --> 00:53.787
IS THAT I WORK HARDER
THAN ANYONE ELSE.

00:53.820 --> 00:55.088
- LOOK ME IN THE EYE, MAN.

00:55.121 --> 00:57.157
- YES, I WANT YOU TO LEAVE.

01:22.849 --> 01:24.584
- WHAT'S ALL THIS PAPER
ON YOUR DESK?

01:24.617 --> 01:26.486
IS IT JUST PRETEND,
OR YOU'RE ACTUALLY WORKING?

01:26.519 --> 01:27.754
- THIS IS ALL ACTUAL WORK.

01:27.787 --> 01:29.489
IT'S REAL WORK.
TODAY, ANYWAY.

01:29.522 --> 01:31.358
MY BOSS, EDDIE SHAPIRO,

01:31.391 --> 01:32.692
HE BRINGS IN BUSINESS,

01:32.726 --> 01:35.395
BUT HE ALSO TERRIFIES ME.

01:35.428 --> 01:39.265
- WE'VE GOT ANOTHER PROJECT.
MAURICE MANN.

01:39.299 --> 01:41.768
HE'S INTERVIEWING
A NUMBER OF BROKERS.

01:41.801 --> 01:43.470
I WANT YOU TO GO
AND MEET MAURICE TOMORROW.

01:43.503 --> 01:45.872
- I'M MEETING WITH MAURICE?

01:45.905 --> 01:51.111
MAURICE MANN IS A MASSIVE
DEVELOPER IN MANHATTAN.

01:51.111 --> 01:52.445
I'VE NEVER
MET HIM PERSONALLY.

01:52.479 --> 01:53.580
I'VE HEARD HE'S VERY PICKY

01:53.613 --> 01:54.881
ABOUT WHO HE CHOOSES
TO WORK WITH.

01:54.914 --> 01:58.218
- THERE IS, UH, A VERY,
VERY SPECIAL BUILDING.

01:58.251 --> 01:59.486
GRAMERCY PARK.

01:59.519 --> 02:00.920
- ON GRAMERCY PARK?

02:00.954 --> 02:02.088
- GRAMERCY PARK.

02:02.122 --> 02:03.490
WE HAVE TO NAIL IT.

02:03.523 --> 02:04.891
- GOT IT. I'M ON IT.

02:04.924 --> 02:07.527
- DON'T WALK BACK IN THE OFFICE
WITHOUT THE LISTING.

02:07.560 --> 02:09.729
TOMORROW AT 12:00.

02:09.763 --> 02:10.730
- I WON'T BE LATE.

02:10.764 --> 02:11.865
- ARE YOU SURE?
- YEAH.

02:11.898 --> 02:14.768
I'M SMILING BECAUSE
YOU'RE INTENSE.

02:14.801 --> 02:17.270
- YEAH.

02:18.672 --> 02:20.674
- THANK YOU.

02:29.749 --> 02:31.284
- YOU HAVE TO LOOK GOOD
IN NEW YORK.

02:31.317 --> 02:33.153
IF I'M GONNA SELL
A $20 MILLION PENTHOUSE,

02:33.186 --> 02:35.488
I BETTER NOT SHOW UP
IN A CHEAP SUIT.

02:35.522 --> 02:37.323
YOU KNOW, THAT'S DISRESPECTFUL
TO THE SELLER.

02:37.357 --> 02:39.159
BECAUSE ALL WE NEED
TO DO AS AGENTS

02:39.192 --> 02:41.394
IS TO RESPECT THE PROPERTY

02:41.428 --> 02:42.629
AND REPRESENT THE LOVE

02:42.662 --> 02:44.397
THAT THE SELLER PUT DOWN
INTO THE PROPERTY.

02:44.431 --> 02:45.999
IF WE CAN'T DRESS WELL,
WE CAN'T SMELL GOOD,

02:46.099 --> 02:49.102
THEN WHAT ARE WE?

02:49.102 --> 02:50.704
[cell phone rings]

02:50.737 --> 02:51.938
FREDRIK SPEAKING.

02:53.473 --> 02:54.474
- HOW'S IT GOING?

02:54.507 --> 02:55.975
- HI, ZACH. HOW ARE YOU?
GOOD MORNING.

03:02.549 --> 03:04.217
ZACH VELLA IS A DEVELOPER
IN NEW YORK CITY.

03:04.250 --> 03:06.186
HE ONLY DEVELOPS THE BEST,

03:06.219 --> 03:07.854
MOST HIGH-QUALITY PRODUCTS.

03:07.887 --> 03:09.889
WHEN DO YOU WANT TO MEET?

03:11.491 --> 03:12.692
YEAH, TOMORROW WORKS.

03:12.726 --> 03:14.160
SO I'M VERY HAPPY
TO GET ANOTHER CALL,

03:14.194 --> 03:15.395
'CAUSE I REALLY HOPE

03:15.428 --> 03:17.364
THAT HE WANTS TO DO
BUSINESS WITH ME. AGAIN.

03:17.397 --> 03:19.432
SEE YOU THEN.
THANK YOU.

03:26.806 --> 03:28.675
[horn honks]

03:31.511 --> 03:32.679
- WHAT'S GOING ON?

03:32.712 --> 03:35.782
- SO YOU KNOW HOW MY BUYER
LOVED 1055 PARK?

03:35.815 --> 03:36.883
- YEAH.

03:36.916 --> 03:38.485
- HE THINKS IT'S SO SEXY,
SO COOL.

03:38.518 --> 03:40.086
- IT IS.

03:40.086 --> 03:42.322
I'M GLAD HE LIKED IT.
- YEAH.

03:42.355 --> 03:44.357
- THE QUESTION IS HOW MUCH
DID HE LIKE IT?

03:44.391 --> 03:45.925
- HE ACTUALLY WANTS
TO PUT AN OFFER IN

03:45.959 --> 03:49.496
ON THE ENTIRE BUILDING.

03:49.529 --> 03:50.964
- THIS IS NUTS.

03:50.997 --> 03:53.133
IF I CAN PULL THIS DEAL OFF,

03:53.166 --> 03:56.136
IT'LL PROPEL ME INTO ONE
OF THE CITY'S BIGGEST BROKERS,

03:56.169 --> 04:00.807
AND I CAN START CRUSHING
HUGE DEALS.

04:00.840 --> 04:02.175
- WELL, HERE'S THE THING.

04:02.208 --> 04:04.144
IF HE CAN'T HAVE
THE WHOLE DEAL,

04:04.177 --> 04:05.845
HE'S NOT IN IT.

04:05.879 --> 04:08.048
IT'S ALL OR NOTHING.

04:08.048 --> 04:10.884
- I'M GONNA CALL THEM RIGHT NOW.

04:10.917 --> 04:13.787
[cell phone rings]

04:13.820 --> 04:15.221
- HEY, DINA.
IT'S MICHAEL LORBER.

04:15.255 --> 04:16.389
HOW ARE YOU?

04:18.058 --> 04:19.793
I'M WITH A BROKER,

04:19.826 --> 04:22.162
AND HER CLIENT
LOVED THE DUPLEX,

04:22.195 --> 04:24.164
BUT WHAT THEY LOVED MORE
THAN THE DUPLEX

04:24.197 --> 04:26.266
IS THE ENTIRE BUILDING.

04:26.299 --> 04:30.070
THEY LOVE ALL FIVE
OF THE UNITS.

04:32.706 --> 04:34.407
I JUST THINK THEY WANT
THE WHOLE BUILDING.

04:34.441 --> 04:35.842
THEY WANT ALL FIVE
OF THE UNITS.

04:40.347 --> 04:41.314
OKAY, I'LL CALL YOU LATER.

04:41.348 --> 04:42.315
I'LL GIVE YOU AN UPDATE.

04:42.349 --> 04:44.284
HI.
SORRY IT TOOK SO LONG.

04:44.317 --> 04:45.251
- DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT.

04:45.285 --> 04:46.920
- [sighs]

04:53.393 --> 04:56.429
TWO OF THE OTHER APARTMENTS
ARE UNDER CONTRACT

04:56.463 --> 04:58.131
WITH OTHER BUYERS.

04:58.164 --> 05:00.533
IT'S JUST OUT OF MY HANDS NOW.
I MEAN...

05:00.567 --> 05:02.235
- SO THE CONTRACTS
ARE SIGNED?

05:02.268 --> 05:04.170
- YEAH.

05:06.473 --> 05:08.174
I, UM...

05:08.208 --> 05:11.878
HE WON'T JUST DO ONE DUPLEX?
ONE APARTMENT?

05:11.911 --> 05:13.646
- I DON'T KNOW.
HE WANTS IT ALL.

05:13.680 --> 05:14.681
- HE WANTS IT ALL.

05:14.714 --> 05:18.785
- ALL RIGHT.
I'LL LET MY BUYER KNOW.

05:18.818 --> 05:20.553
HE'S GONNA BE BUMMED.

05:20.587 --> 05:22.655
- I'M SORRY.

05:22.689 --> 05:24.691
THIS IS A HUGE DEAL TO LOSE.

05:24.724 --> 05:26.292
AND NOW I HAVE
TO EXPLAIN TO MY DAD

05:26.326 --> 05:27.660
HOW I LOST A HUGE CLIENT

05:27.694 --> 05:29.596
AND DIDN'T GET
A WHOLE BUILDING SOLD.

05:29.629 --> 05:31.064
UGH.

05:41.408 --> 05:42.742
- HEY, FREDRIK.
- HEY, HOW ARE YOU?

05:42.776 --> 05:44.177
GOOD TO SEE YOU.
- HOW'S EVERYTHING?

05:44.210 --> 05:45.412
- SO WHAT IS THIS?

05:45.445 --> 05:46.379
- OUR NEW PROJECT.

05:46.413 --> 05:47.580
- HAVE YOU PICKED
A BROKER YET?

05:47.614 --> 05:48.682
- NO.

05:48.715 --> 05:50.083
- WELL, YOU KNOW
I'M THE GUY TO DO IT,

05:50.083 --> 05:52.652
SO I'M REALLY THANKFUL
FOR YOU INVITING ME.

05:52.686 --> 05:54.154
- IT'S 32,000 SQUARE FEET.

05:54.187 --> 05:56.289
IT'S 12 APARTMENTS.

05:56.322 --> 05:58.692
- ZACH IS BUYING
A LOT OF SITES RIGHT NOW.

05:58.725 --> 06:03.496
THE COOLEST, BOUTIQUE,
DOWNTOWN CONDO LOFT BUILDINGS.

06:03.530 --> 06:05.198
- THIS IS WHAT I THINK'S
GONNA SELL THE UNIT.

06:05.231 --> 06:06.399
- YEAH,
FLOOR TO CEILING GLASS.

06:06.433 --> 06:07.567
- AND THE PARK, YOU KNOW,

06:07.600 --> 06:09.302
THE TREES GET A LITTLE
GREENER NEXT MONTH.

06:09.336 --> 06:11.871
THE VIEW'S
GONNA BE SPECTACULAR.

06:11.905 --> 06:13.640
- WHAT IS--WHAT KIND
OF GLASS IS THIS?

06:13.673 --> 06:14.874
- IT'S A SCHUCO CURTAIN WALL.

06:14.908 --> 06:16.876
- OH, OKAY. SCHUCO.
GREAT. GERMANY.

06:16.910 --> 06:18.845
- WE SPENT A LOT OF TIME
ENGINEERING THE GLASS

06:18.878 --> 06:20.447
SO THAT THE SOUND
WOULD BE AS, UH,

06:20.480 --> 06:21.614
AS QUIET AS POSSIBLE.

06:21.648 --> 06:23.650
- CAN I GET A SOUND STUDY TOO,
SO, YOU KNOW...

06:23.683 --> 06:25.085
- SURE.
- PERFECT.

06:25.118 --> 06:27.220
THE ISSUE I'M GONNA HAVE
WHEN I SELL IT FOR YOU IS THAT--

06:27.253 --> 06:28.455
- YOU'RE ASSUMING THAT

06:28.488 --> 06:30.123
YOU'RE ALREADY
THE BROKER THERE, FREDRIK.

06:30.156 --> 06:32.459
- WHO ELSE IS GONNA DO IT?

06:32.492 --> 06:34.594
- WHAT KIND OF TIMELINE
ARE WE TALKING?

06:34.627 --> 06:36.363
TO ACTUALLY GET
THESE UNITS SOLD.

06:36.396 --> 06:37.764
- WELL,
I THINK I CAN GET IT DONE

06:37.797 --> 06:39.766
IN, LIKE,
FOUR MONTHS, MAYBE.

06:39.799 --> 06:41.534
'CAUSE YOU'RE NOT
GONNA BE DONE UNTIL, LIKE,

06:41.568 --> 06:42.602
SIX, SEVEN MONTHS ANYWAY.

06:42.635 --> 06:43.636
- WE--WE WANT TO KNOW,

06:43.670 --> 06:45.105
AND OUR LENDERS WANT TO KNOW

06:45.138 --> 06:47.073
THAT THERE'S UNITS IN CONTRACT,
YOU KNOW, LONG BEFORE THEN.

06:47.107 --> 06:48.608
- THE REASON WHY A DEVELOPER

06:48.641 --> 06:50.977
WOULD WANT TO SELL OUT
BEFORE THE BUILDING IS DONE

06:51.077 --> 06:52.879
IS BECAUSE
IT REDUCES THE RISK.

06:52.912 --> 06:54.581
THE SOONER
THE MONEY COMES IN,

06:54.614 --> 06:56.583
THE SOONER THEY CAN
PAY OFF THEIR MORTGAGES

06:56.616 --> 06:58.785
AND MOVE ON
TO THE NEXT INVESTMENT.

06:58.818 --> 07:01.087
I THINK WHAT YOU NEED TO DO
IS TO HIRE THE RIGHT TEAM,

07:01.121 --> 07:03.023
AND WHAT I MEAN
WITH A TEAM IS ME,

07:03.056 --> 07:04.024
THE DIRECTOR OF SALES,

07:04.057 --> 07:05.892
MY ASSISTANTS
THAT KEEP SHOWING.

07:05.925 --> 07:07.894
WE NEED THE BROCHURE,
THE MARKETING MATERIAL.

07:07.927 --> 07:09.029
WE NEED PRESS ON THIS.

07:09.062 --> 07:10.497
I WANT IT IN
ALL THE BIG MAGAZINES.

07:10.530 --> 07:12.165
AND THEN I WANT
A BROKER OPEN HOUSE

07:12.198 --> 07:13.767
TO SHOW THIS SITE TO THEM.

07:13.800 --> 07:16.036
- FREDRIK, YOU DON'T THINK
THIS PLACE IS GONNA SELL ITSELF?

07:16.036 --> 07:17.804
- I'M MAKING
THESE DEMANDS OF ZACH

07:17.837 --> 07:19.139
BECAUSE THE UNITS
ARE NOT DONE.

07:19.172 --> 07:20.640
BUYERS CAN'T EVEN SEE
WHAT THEY'RE BUYING.

07:20.674 --> 07:22.308
YOU HAVE TO GIVE THEM A VISION

07:22.342 --> 07:23.843
OF WHAT THE KITCHEN,
THE BATHROOMS,

07:23.877 --> 07:25.912
AND EVEN SOMETIMES
THE VIEW IS GONNA BE LIKE.

07:25.945 --> 07:27.781
- WE JUST NEED
TO TALK ABOUT PRICING.

07:27.814 --> 07:29.215
- WHAT ABOUT COMMISSION?

07:29.249 --> 07:30.917
- OH, I'M GONNA BEAT YOU UP
A LITTLE BIT ON THIS ONE.

07:30.950 --> 07:32.052
- WHAT DO YOU HAVE IN MIND?

07:32.052 --> 07:33.286
- WE'RE LOOKING AT, YOU KNOW,

07:33.319 --> 07:35.321
ROUGHLY HALF OF WHAT THE NORMAL
COMMISSION THAT WE--

07:35.355 --> 07:38.425
- HALF? I MEAN,
IT'S GOT TO BE AT LEAST 6%--

07:38.458 --> 07:40.360
3% TO ME,
3% TO THE OTHER SIDE.

07:40.393 --> 07:42.696
- WE'RE LOOKING TO DO,
LIKE, 2 1/2 TO YOU.

07:42.729 --> 07:44.364
AND, UH, AND IF
THERE'S A CO-BROKER,

07:44.397 --> 07:46.800
WE'RE--YOU KNOW,
WE'LL PAY A LITTLE BIT MORE.

07:49.536 --> 07:52.105
- 2 1/2 TIMES 50 MILLION.

07:52.138 --> 07:55.141
THAT'S 1,250,000
IN COMMISSION.

07:55.175 --> 07:57.243
THIS BUILDING
HAS 12 UNITS TO SELL,

07:57.277 --> 07:59.679
AND WHEN I DO...
CHING, CHING!

07:59.713 --> 08:00.914
MAJOR PAYDAY.

08:01.014 --> 08:04.784
SO I'M YOUR BROKER.

08:04.818 --> 08:06.553
- YOU...

08:06.586 --> 08:07.554
- REALLY?

08:07.587 --> 08:08.588
- WE'LL WORK IT OUT.

08:08.621 --> 08:09.622
- WORK IT OUT?
AM I YOUR BROKER?

08:09.656 --> 08:10.757
- I PROMISE.
YES.

08:10.790 --> 08:12.359
- YOU PROMISE?
- YES. YOU GOT IT.

08:12.392 --> 08:14.494
- OKAY. 2 1/2%.
$50 MILLION.

08:14.527 --> 08:17.030
MM. GOOD. LET'S GO.

08:25.772 --> 08:27.507
- I'M DRIVING BY
GRAMERCY PARK RIGHT NOW,

08:27.540 --> 08:30.243
ABOUT TO GO TO 36.

08:30.276 --> 08:31.678
GRAMERCY PARK
IS A GREAT LOCATION,

08:31.711 --> 08:33.713
BECAUSE IT'S ONE OF THE MOST
EXCLUSIVE NEIGHBORHOODS

08:33.747 --> 08:35.115
IN ALL OF MANHATTAN.

08:35.148 --> 08:37.317
JULIA ROBERTS HAS A PLACE
ON GRAMERCY SQUARE PARK.

08:37.350 --> 08:40.053
IT IS THE ONLY PRIVATE PARK
IN PROPER MANHATTAN,

08:40.086 --> 08:42.455
AND IF YOU OWN AN APARTMENT
ON GRAMERCY PARK,

08:42.489 --> 08:46.459
YOU ARE DEEDED A PRIVATE KEY
TO THAT PARK.

08:46.493 --> 08:52.832
AND THAT'S LUXURY.

08:52.866 --> 08:55.235
36 GRAMERCY PARK EAST
IS A RENTAL BUILDING

08:55.268 --> 08:56.403
THAT'S CONVERTING TO CONDO.

08:56.436 --> 08:57.437
HOW ARE YOU?

08:57.470 --> 08:59.072
- GOOD.
NICE TO SEE YOU, SIR.

08:59.072 --> 09:00.006
- HEY, MAURICE.

09:00.006 --> 09:01.875
- RYAN.

09:01.908 --> 09:04.244
- MAURICE HAS OWNED
THE BUILDING FOR SIX YEARS,

09:04.277 --> 09:05.612
AND HE RENOVATES
EACH APARTMENT

09:05.645 --> 09:07.013
AND THEN SELLS THEM.

09:07.047 --> 09:09.049
BTU HE CAN'T SELL 'EM
UNTIL THEY BECOME AVAILABLE.

09:09.082 --> 09:10.450
TO GET IN THERE,

09:10.483 --> 09:13.820
PEOPLE ARE LITERALLY WAITING
FOR OTHER PEOPLE TO DIE.

09:13.853 --> 09:16.389
- THIS APARTMENT
WAS COMPLETELY GUT-RENOVATED.

09:16.423 --> 09:18.792
I'LL TAKE YOU THROUGH IT NOW.

09:42.749 --> 09:45.785
- THERE ARE FEW TIMES WHEN
YOU'RE WORKING IN REAL ESTATE

09:45.819 --> 09:47.053
THAT YOU WALK
INTO AN APARTMENT

09:47.053 --> 09:49.222
THAT LITERALLY
TAKES YOUR BREATH AWAY,

09:49.255 --> 09:50.757
AND THAT APARTMENT
DOES THAT FOR ME.

09:50.790 --> 09:52.425
THE EXCLUSIVITY
IS VERY, VERY KEY HERE,

09:52.459 --> 09:54.394
AND THAT'S WHAT'S GONNA
HELP DRIVE UP THE PRICE.

09:54.427 --> 09:55.729
- WE WANT TO BE FAIR
ABOUT THE PRICE.

09:55.762 --> 09:57.330
- I DON'T WANT TO BE FAIR
ABOUT THE PRICE.

09:57.364 --> 09:58.898
I WANT TO GET YOU
AS MUCH MONEY AS POSSIBLE.

09:58.932 --> 10:00.066
- WE WANT TO GET A GOOD PRICE,

10:00.000 --> 10:01.134
BUT WE WANT
TO BE FAIR ABOUT IT.

10:01.167 --> 10:02.302
- ABSOLUTELY.
- OKAY.

10:02.335 --> 10:03.636
- I'M WALKING THROUGH
THE APARTMENT,

10:03.670 --> 10:04.738
AND I SEE THE BAY WINDOWS.

10:04.771 --> 10:06.406
I SEE THE EXQUISITE MOLDINGS.

10:06.439 --> 10:08.341
I SEE THE WOOD FLOORS.
I SEE THE MARBLE BATHROOM.

10:08.375 --> 10:09.809
AND WITH EACH THING
THAT I SEE,

10:09.843 --> 10:12.078
I'M THINKING, "MORE MONEY, MORE
MONEY, MORE MONEY, MORE MONEY."

10:12.112 --> 10:13.480
HOW MUCH DID IT COST
TO PUT THESE IN?

10:13.513 --> 10:14.814
- I--I DON'T WANT TO KNOW.

10:14.848 --> 10:16.349
I DON'T WANT TO KNOW.

10:16.383 --> 10:17.584
- BUT THEN YOU JUST,
YOU KNOW--

10:17.617 --> 10:19.886
THEN EVERY 10,000 YOU GET
AN EXTRA 100,000

10:19.919 --> 10:21.087
ON THE PURCHASE PRICE.

10:21.121 --> 10:23.490
- GOD, YOU CHARGE
FOR EVERY LITTLE DOORKNOB.

10:23.523 --> 10:26.059
HAVE A SEAT.

10:26.092 --> 10:28.561
SO, RYAN,
WHY SHOULD I GO WITH YOU?

10:28.595 --> 10:30.730
WHAT MAKES YOU SO SPECIAL

10:30.764 --> 10:33.600
FROM THE OTHER PRIMARY BROKERS
I HAVE SPOKEN TO?

10:33.633 --> 10:35.168
ONE GAL'S AWFULLY PRETTY.

10:35.201 --> 10:36.469
- YOU DON'T THINK I'M PRETTY?

10:36.503 --> 10:38.838
- YOU'RE FINE.
BUT I'M...YOU KNOW,

10:38.872 --> 10:41.408
SERIOUSLY,
WHY SHOULD I SELECT YOU?

10:41.441 --> 10:44.244
- I CAN OFFER
THE INTERNATIONAL CLIENTS.

10:44.277 --> 10:45.578
- WELL, THAT'S IMPORTANT.
- RIGHT.

10:45.612 --> 10:47.113
- SO WHAT DO YOU THINK
THAT THIS--

10:47.147 --> 10:49.382
THIS APARTMENT SHOULD GO FOR?

10:49.416 --> 10:50.684
- I MEAN, IT'S--

10:50.717 --> 10:52.686
IT'S A LITTLE UNDER
2,200 SQUARE FEET, RIGHT?

10:52.719 --> 10:53.687
- RIGHT.

10:53.720 --> 10:55.055
- OKAY,
THERE ARE REALLY NO COMPS,

10:55.088 --> 10:56.656
BECAUSE THERE'S REALLY
NOTHING ELSE LIKE IT

10:56.690 --> 10:57.691
ON THE MARKET RIGHT NOW.

10:57.724 --> 10:59.926
IT'S THREE BED,
3 1/2 BATH.

10:59.959 --> 11:03.430
THE BIGGEST CONDO
FACING GRAMERCY PARK.

11:03.463 --> 11:05.231
5 MILLION?

11:05.265 --> 11:06.800
- WOW.

11:06.833 --> 11:09.135
- NORMALLY, I MIGHT HESITATE
TO LIST AN APARTMENT

11:09.169 --> 11:10.403
AT $2,300 A SQUARE FOOT,

11:10.437 --> 11:12.105
'CAUSE ONLY THE BEST BUILDINGS
IN MANHATTAN

11:12.138 --> 11:13.740
COULD COMMAND
THAT KIND OF PRICE.

11:13.773 --> 11:18.078
THIS BUILDING JUST HAPPENS
TO BE ONE OF 'EM.

11:18.078 --> 11:19.346
- A LITTLE AGGRESSIVE,

11:19.379 --> 11:21.114
BUT I GUESS YOU NEED
A LITTLE ROOM TO MOVE AROUND.

11:21.147 --> 11:23.183
- I MEAN, I THINK I CAN YOU
THE HIGHEST PRICE POSSIBLE.

11:23.216 --> 11:24.851
NOT JUST BECAUSE OF HOW
I'M GONNA MARKET THIS,

11:24.884 --> 11:28.088
BUT BECAUSE OF THE PERSONAL
ATTENTION THAT I'LL PUT INTO IT.

11:28.088 --> 11:29.322
- WHY NOT?
- YOU WANT TO TRY FOR IT?

11:29.356 --> 11:30.590
- YEAH, SURE.
GO FOR IT. GO AHEAD.

11:30.623 --> 11:31.725
- WANT TO DO IT?
- DO THE DEAL.

11:31.758 --> 11:33.093
- OKAY.
- ALL RIGHT?

11:33.126 --> 11:35.128
- SO I'LL SEND ALL THE PAPERWORK
OVER TO YOUR OFFICE.

11:35.161 --> 11:37.097
- GREAT.
SOUNDS GOOD.

11:37.097 --> 11:38.331
- COMING UP...

11:38.365 --> 11:41.234
I'VE HAD DEALS...
OR NOT GOTTEN DEALS DONE,

11:41.267 --> 11:43.737
YOU KNOW,
WHICH IS FRUSTRATING.

11:43.770 --> 11:44.838
LIKE, I HAD ONE AT...

11:44.871 --> 11:46.339
- YEAH, THAT'S--
YOU KNOW WHAT? STOP.

11:46.373 --> 11:56.716
THAT'S, LIKE,
A BIG MISTAKE.

11:56.750 --> 11:57.884
- I HAVE A LOT OF ENERGY.

11:57.917 --> 11:59.619
I WAKE UP 5:00 a.m.
EVERY MORNING,

11:59.652 --> 12:02.322
AND I'M IN THE GYM AT 5:30.

12:02.355 --> 12:04.190
IT'S ACTUALLY IN THE GYM
I'M MOST PRODUCTIVE.

12:04.224 --> 12:08.361
I WRITE HUNDREDS OF EMAILS
BETWEEN EXERCISES.

12:08.395 --> 12:12.265
HOWEVER, I DO TRY TO TAKE
A FEW MOMENTS OUT OF EACH DAY

12:12.298 --> 12:14.968
TO SLOW DOWN
AND CATCH MY BREATH.

12:26.513 --> 12:28.581
HEY, HOW ARE YOU?

12:29.816 --> 12:30.917
I'M A LITTLE STRESSED OUT,

12:30.950 --> 12:32.352
BECAUSE WE DON'T HAVE
ANY BROCHURES,

12:32.385 --> 12:34.120
AS YOU KNOW,
FOR 471 WASHINGTON.

12:34.154 --> 12:36.156
WE HAVE NO FLOOR PLANS.
WE HAVE NOTHING.

12:36.189 --> 12:38.091
I'M ABOUT TO START SELLING
THIS BUILDING RIGHT NOW.

12:38.124 --> 12:39.759
THIS IS SO FRUSTRATING.

12:39.793 --> 12:41.127
I HAVE MY MARKETING TEAM
IN PLACE.

12:41.161 --> 12:42.295
I'VE GIVEN THEM THE PLANS,

12:42.328 --> 12:44.764
BUT THINGS ARE NOT
GOING FAST ENOUGH.

12:44.798 --> 12:46.132
I NEED A--A MEETING.

12:46.166 --> 12:48.001
PROBABLY, LIKE, LATER TODAY
IF THAT'S POSSIBLE.

12:48.101 --> 12:49.102
IF YOU COULD CALL EVERYBODY.

12:49.102 --> 12:50.403
I NEED CASANDRA THERE,
YOU THERE.

12:50.437 --> 12:52.105
I DEFINITELY NEED
THE ARCHITECT THERE.

12:52.105 --> 12:54.174
MAYBE WE CAN DO IT
AT THE ARCHITECT'S OFFICE?

12:54.207 --> 12:55.408
WE ALL GOT TO GET
ON THE SAME PAGE

12:55.442 --> 12:56.776
AND PULL THIS TOGETHER
RIGHT NOW.

12:56.810 --> 12:58.745
THE BROKER'S OPEN
FOR ZACH'S NEW BUILDING

12:58.778 --> 13:00.113
IS IN LESS THAN A WEEK.

13:00.146 --> 13:02.315
IT'S IMPERATIVE THAT I
GET THESE THINGS IN ORDER

13:02.349 --> 13:04.617
BEFORE ANYONE SETS FOOT
IN THAT BUILDING.

13:04.651 --> 13:07.721
OKAY, YOU MAKE IT WORK.
THANK YOU SO MUCH.

13:15.228 --> 13:17.530
[horn honks]

13:19.299 --> 13:20.467
- HEY, MIKE.
- HEY, DAD.

13:20.500 --> 13:23.303
- WHAT'S DOING?
- NOT MUCH. WHAT'S UP?

13:23.336 --> 13:24.637
I'M REALLY STRESSED OUT.

13:24.671 --> 13:25.905
NOT ONLY HAVE I
LOST THE COMMISSION,

13:25.939 --> 13:27.407
BUT NOW I GOT TO TELL
MY DAD WHAT HAPPENED.

13:27.440 --> 13:29.442
I MEAN, HE'S THE CHAIRMAN
OF OUR COMPANY,

13:29.476 --> 13:30.810
BUT HE'S ALSO MY BOSS.

13:30.844 --> 13:31.811
- WHAT'S HAPPENING?

13:31.845 --> 13:34.447
- NO, YOU KNOW...

13:34.481 --> 13:36.516
THINGS ARE MOVING ALONG.
YOU KNOW, UPS, DOWNS.

13:36.549 --> 13:38.885
- WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?
UPS, DOWNS.

13:38.918 --> 13:40.086
- WELL, YOU KNOW, IT'S...

13:40.086 --> 13:43.089
I'VE HAD DEALS,
OR NOT GOTTEN DEALS DONE.

13:43.089 --> 13:45.458
YOU KNOW,
WHICH IS FRUSTRATING.

13:45.492 --> 13:46.559
LIKE, I HAD ONE AT...

13:46.593 --> 13:48.128
- YEAH, THAT'S--
YOU KNOW WHAT? STOP.

13:48.161 --> 13:49.596
THAT'S, LIKE, A BIG MISTAKE.
- WHAT?

13:49.629 --> 13:50.964
- OKAY?
THE WAY YOU'RE THINKING.

13:50.997 --> 13:53.400
BECAUSE YOU'RE FOCUSING
ON NOT WHAT YOU DID,

13:53.433 --> 13:54.701
BUT WHAT YOU DIDN'T DO.

13:54.734 --> 13:56.302
AND I'M--BY THE WAY,
I'M THE SAME WAY.

13:56.336 --> 13:58.238
- YOU KNOW, YEAH, I MEAN,
I GUESS I'M HARD ON MYSELF.

13:58.271 --> 13:59.806
YEAH, I MEAN,
I LOOK AT, YOU KNOW,

13:59.839 --> 14:01.474
YEAH, I GUESS I WORKED HARD
FOR MY CLIENTS,

14:01.508 --> 14:02.842
BUT AT THE END OF THE DAY,

14:02.876 --> 14:05.111
I STILL DIDN'T--I LOST
THE DEAL 415 GRAND STREET.

14:05.145 --> 14:07.447
AND 1055 PARK,
IT'S SUCH AN AMAZING BUILDING

14:07.480 --> 14:09.049
AND EVERYONE
I TAKE THERE LOVES IT,

14:09.049 --> 14:11.484
BUT IT'S TOUGH TO GET IT,
YOU KNOW, DONE.

14:11.518 --> 14:13.720
- YOU KNOW, THE BUSINESS
IS REALLY VERY SIMPLE.

14:13.753 --> 14:16.423
THERE WILL BE TIMES
YOU WORK VERY HARD.

14:16.456 --> 14:17.791
- RIGHT.
- AND A LOT OF EFFORT.

14:17.824 --> 14:19.626
- NOTHING HAPPENS.
- AND YOU MAKE ZERO.

14:19.659 --> 14:22.595
AND THERE WILL BE TIMES THAT
YOU DON'T WORK MUCH AT ALL...

14:22.629 --> 14:24.964
- RIGHT, AND THE DEAL GETS DONE.
- AND YOU MAKE A LOT OF MONEY.

14:25.065 --> 14:26.433
- THAT'S THE HISTORY
OF SALES PEOPLE,

14:26.466 --> 14:27.867
AND ANY--PRETTY MUCH
IN ANY PROFESSION.

14:27.901 --> 14:29.536
LOOK, YOU KNOW A LOT MORE

14:29.569 --> 14:31.571
THAN THE BULK OF THE BROKERS
THAT HAVE BEEN IN THE BUSINESS

14:31.604 --> 14:32.772
FOR MANY, MANY YEARS.
- RIGHT.

14:32.806 --> 14:34.341
- AND, I MEAN,
MAYBE NOT CERTAIN THINGS,

14:34.374 --> 14:37.110
BUT AS FAR AS
YOUR KNOWLEDGE OF...OF...

14:37.143 --> 14:38.478
BUILDINGS AND PRIOR OWNERS,
YOU KNOW.

14:38.511 --> 14:40.080
- BUT HOW MUCH DOES
THAT STUFF PAY INTO?

14:40.113 --> 14:41.247
- WELL, YOU KNOW,
YOU HAVE TO--

14:41.281 --> 14:42.782
- I KNOW THE HISTORICAL
SALES NUMBERS.

14:42.816 --> 14:44.250
I KNOW ARCHITECTURE.
I KNOW HISTORY.

14:44.284 --> 14:45.752
I KNOW...
- EXACTLY.

14:45.785 --> 14:47.120
YOU HAVE TO USE
THAT KNOWLEDGE.

14:47.153 --> 14:48.388
PEOPLE DO WANT TO HEAR...

14:48.421 --> 14:50.090
- KNOWING FACTS LIKE THAT
YOU THINK HELPS SELLS?

14:50.090 --> 14:51.391
- YEAH,
KNOWING FACTS HELPS SELL.

14:51.424 --> 14:52.859
YOU KNOW,
PEOPLE LOVE TO HEAR ABOUT IT.

14:52.892 --> 14:54.294
IF THEY'RE LOOKING
AT A TOWNHOUSE...

14:54.327 --> 14:56.129
- YEAH, THEY LOVE TO KNOW
SO AND SO LIVED HERE...

14:56.162 --> 14:57.997
- THEY LOVE TO KNOW
WHO LIVED THERE, WHO BUILT IT.

14:58.098 --> 14:59.566
YOU KNOW, WHO IS THE ARCHITECT,
YOU KNOW?

14:59.599 --> 15:01.034
- OR WHAT ELSE THEY DESIGNED.

15:01.034 --> 15:03.236
- YOU REALLY HAVE
A GREAT BACKGROUND.

15:03.269 --> 15:04.537
- RIGHT.

15:04.571 --> 15:06.639
- YOU HAVE A GREAT BACKGROUND
TO BE A FANTASTIC--

15:06.673 --> 15:08.208
YOU KNOW,
ONE OF THE GREAT BROKERS.

15:08.241 --> 15:10.043
BUT YOU HAVE TO WORK--
YOU HAVE TO WORK HARD.

15:10.043 --> 15:12.145
- YEP.

15:19.119 --> 15:20.520
- THIS IS COLONIAL WHIMSICAL.

15:20.553 --> 15:22.155
IT'S, LIKE, A PINKISH,
LIKE, MAUVE COLOR.

15:22.188 --> 15:23.289
IT'S PRETTY.

15:23.323 --> 15:25.058
- HELLO, HELLO, HELLO, HELLO.

15:25.058 --> 15:27.060
- RYAN, HOW ARE YOU?
- GOOD. HOW ARE YOU?

15:27.060 --> 15:28.161
- GOOD.

15:28.194 --> 15:29.562
- CAN WE TOUCH ON THESE
A LITTLE BIT?

15:29.596 --> 15:31.598
- ABSOLUTELY.
- DID YOU TAKE A LOOK AT THESE?

15:31.631 --> 15:36.136
DID YOU TAKE A LOOK
AT THIS ONE?

15:36.169 --> 15:39.339
THESE SUCK.

15:39.372 --> 15:40.573
MY LISTING
AT GRAMERCY PARK

15:40.607 --> 15:42.909
WITH MAURICE MANN
IS A HUGE DEAL FOR ME,

15:42.942 --> 15:45.412
SO I'VE ENLISTED
THE HELP OF CAROL FREEDMAN

15:45.445 --> 15:46.613
TO HELP ME
WITH THE MARKETING.

15:46.646 --> 15:48.882
- OKAY. AND WHY?

15:48.915 --> 15:51.084
- WELL, FIRST, THIS IMAGE,
YOU CAN'T EVEN SEE.

15:51.084 --> 15:52.619
I DON'T EVEN KNOW WHAT THAT IS.

15:52.652 --> 15:54.788
IT'S THE WHOLE THING.
FROM THE PITCH WITH MAURICE--

15:54.821 --> 15:56.556
- OKAY, FIRST OF ALL,
IT DIDN'T PRINT PROPERLY.

15:56.589 --> 15:58.191
- WAIT, WAIT, WAIT.
FIRST, DON'T TALK OVER ME.

15:58.224 --> 16:00.527
AND I CAN BARELY EVEN READ THIS,
AND THE WRITING IS TOO SMALL,

16:00.560 --> 16:02.495
AND IT DOESN'T
SCREAM EXCLUSIVITY.

16:02.529 --> 16:04.664
- WHAT DO YOU THINK
WE'RE MISSING?

16:04.698 --> 16:07.467
- FIRST THING IS I WANT
TO GET RID OF THIS ONE.

16:07.500 --> 16:08.635
I DON'T KNOW WHAT THAT IS.

16:08.668 --> 16:10.136
I DON'T WANT TO EVER
TO SEE THAT AGAIN.

16:10.170 --> 16:11.738
I WANT TO GET RID OF THESE.
THESE ARE AWFUL.

16:11.771 --> 16:13.473
AND I WANT TO JUST STICK
TO ONE IMAGE FOR NOW.

16:13.506 --> 16:15.842
THEY SEE THE SCRIPT,
THEY SEE THE BRAND,

16:15.875 --> 16:17.711
AND IT'S IMMEDIATELY
RECOGNIZABLE.

16:17.744 --> 16:19.245
- I TOTALLY AGREE WITH YOU
ON THAT POINT.

16:19.279 --> 16:20.680
- OKAY,
SO WE CAN WORK ON THAT.

16:20.714 --> 16:25.285
SO NOW I WANT TO HAVE
OUR FIRST...OPEN HOUSE.

16:25.318 --> 16:27.053
- I DISAGREE WITH YOU
ON THAT POINT.

16:27.053 --> 16:30.123
UM, I STILL THINK,
IN ORDER TO KEEP IT EXCLUSIVE,

16:30.156 --> 16:32.325
THE SMART THING TO DO
IS MAKE THIS

16:32.359 --> 16:35.128
A SPECIAL EXPERIENCE FOR THEM,

16:35.161 --> 16:41.334
AND I DON'T BELIEVE IN
OPEN HOUSES IN THAT BUILDING.

16:41.368 --> 16:44.204
- OKAY,
SO LETS COMPROMISE.

16:44.237 --> 16:47.173
- OKAY.
- LET'S DO...

16:49.342 --> 16:50.777
WE'RE NOT GONNA DO
AN OPEN HOUSE.

16:50.810 --> 16:51.945
- I AGREE WITH HER.

16:51.978 --> 16:54.114
- WE'RE GONNA DO...
BY INVITATION ONLY.

16:54.147 --> 16:55.648
- OH, GREAT IDEA.

16:55.682 --> 16:56.950
- SO IT'S LIKE AN OPEN HOUSE,

16:56.983 --> 16:59.352
BUT EVERYONE THAT'S COMING
HAS BEEN SELECTED.

16:59.386 --> 17:01.621
- THAT'S EXACTLY RIGHT.
- LET'S DO THAT.

17:01.654 --> 17:03.523
- DINA, YOU'RE OKAY?
YOU'RE GETTING EVERYTHING?

17:03.556 --> 17:04.724
- I'M GOOD.
I'M GOOD, I'M GOOD.

17:04.758 --> 17:05.725
- ALL RIGHT.
SEE YOU GUYS.

17:05.759 --> 17:07.360
- HAVE A GOOD NIGHT,
RYAN.

17:16.202 --> 17:17.270
- WHERE TO, MIKE?

17:17.303 --> 17:19.372
- UM, I'LL GO TO 1055 PARK.

17:19.406 --> 17:21.675
- YOU GOT IT.

17:21.708 --> 17:23.910
- I GOT A PRIVATE SHOWING
UP THERE.

17:23.943 --> 17:26.246
I'M REALLY FOCUSING ON ALL
THE DETAILS IN THE BUILDING NOW,

17:26.279 --> 17:27.681
'CAUSE THE BUILDING
IS SO AMAZING,

17:27.714 --> 17:30.450
BUT IT'S THE LITTLE THINGS THAT
PEOPLE I THINK ALWAYS REMEMBER.

17:30.483 --> 17:31.851
- IT'S ALL
IN THE DETAILS, MIKE.

17:31.885 --> 17:33.853
- YEAH, LIKE, THE MAR--
THE BATHROOMS HERE

17:33.887 --> 17:36.222
HAVE THIS SPECIAL TYPE
OF MARBLE FROM NAMIBIA.

17:36.256 --> 17:37.457
HAVE YOU EVER HEARD
OF NAMIBIA?

17:37.490 --> 17:39.259
- NAMIBIAN MARBLE,
YES, I HAVE.

17:39.292 --> 17:40.293
- REALLY?
- YES, I HAVE.

17:40.326 --> 17:41.561
- I'D NEVER HEARD OF IT BEFORE.

17:41.594 --> 17:43.263
- YOU NEVER HEARD
OF THE COUNTRY OF NAMIBIA?

17:43.296 --> 17:44.631
- NO.

17:44.664 --> 17:48.468
- MY FIRST WIFE WAS
IN THE UNITED NATIONS.

17:48.501 --> 17:49.936
I'M VERY FAMILIAR WITH...
- OH, OKAY.

17:49.969 --> 17:51.671
- SO, MIKE, TELL ME,
DID ANY OF THOSE LADIES--

17:51.705 --> 17:53.973
FROM THAT OPEN HOUSE
COMING TO THIS?

17:54.074 --> 17:55.709
- UH, THIS IS ANOTHER BROKER.

17:55.742 --> 17:58.812
SHE WAS NOT AT THE OPEN HOUSE,
BUT SHE HEARD ABOUT IT.

18:01.681 --> 18:03.149
- MICHAEL?
- YEP, LAUREN?

18:03.183 --> 18:05.552
- HI.
- OH. COMING DOWN.

18:05.585 --> 18:07.320
- I COULDN'T BE MORE PREPARED
FOR THIS SHOWING

18:07.354 --> 18:09.055
THAN I WAS FOR, LIKE,
THE BAR EXAM.

18:09.089 --> 18:11.024
I KNOW SO MANY FACTS I CAN'T
WAIT TO SHARE WITH LAUREN.

18:11.024 --> 18:12.025
COME ON IN.

18:12.025 --> 18:13.026
I KNOW YOU WANT TO SEE IT

18:13.026 --> 18:14.327
BEFORE YOU SHOW IT
TO YOUR CLIENT.

18:14.361 --> 18:15.428
- ABSOLUTELY.

18:15.462 --> 18:17.263
I WAS LOOKING FOR SOMETHING--

18:17.297 --> 18:19.833
A GENEROUS, INCOME-BEARING
INVESTMENT PROPERTY.

18:19.866 --> 18:21.735
- OKAY, GREAT.
SO THIS IS THE LIVING ROOM.

18:24.504 --> 18:25.805
THE ARCHITECT
DID AN AMAZING JOB.

18:25.839 --> 18:27.040
THOMAS O'HARA.

18:27.073 --> 18:28.942
THESE WINDOWS, LIKE,
YOU LOOK ACROSS THE STREET,

18:29.042 --> 18:31.311
YOU SEE THESE TYPICAL,
PARK AVENUE, PRE-WAR WINDOWS.

18:31.344 --> 18:32.912
BUT AS--
WE'RE ON 87TH STREET.

18:32.946 --> 18:35.715
SO THE LANDMARKS DISTRICT,

18:35.749 --> 18:37.250
THE UPPER EAST SIDE
HISTORIC DISTRICT

18:37.283 --> 18:38.551
REALLY ENDS AT 86TH STREET.

18:38.585 --> 18:41.388
SO THE DEVELOPERS WERE
REALLY ABLE TO GET THIS IN.

18:41.421 --> 18:43.089
THAT'S WHY YOU SEE
NOTHING LIKE IT AROUND HERE.

18:43.123 --> 18:44.958
IT'S ALL BRICKS AND LIMESTONE,

18:45.058 --> 18:49.129
AND HERE WE ARE IN THIS
BEAUTIFUL GLASS JEWEL BOX.

18:49.162 --> 18:51.398
THESE CABINETS, YOU KNOW,
THESE ARE LACQUER CABINETS,

18:51.431 --> 18:52.766
NOT WOOD.

18:52.799 --> 18:55.468
6,000 YEARS AGO THE CHINESE
STARTED INVENTING LACQUER.

18:55.502 --> 18:57.737
BECAUSE WHAT--THEY STARTED
USING LACQUER AS, YOU KNOW--

18:57.771 --> 18:59.339
IT WOULD COAT OVER MATERIALS

18:59.372 --> 19:00.740
THAT THEY GET FROM TREE SAP,

19:00.774 --> 19:05.011
AND THEY FIND OUT THAT IT WAS,
YOU KNOW, WATER-RESISTANT.

19:05.011 --> 19:06.646
- MICHAEL IS DEFINITELY NOT
THE TYPICAL,

19:06.680 --> 19:08.548
NEW YORK REAL ESTATE BROKER.

19:08.581 --> 19:09.683
- THE STONE IS REALLY UNIQUE.

19:09.716 --> 19:11.484
IT'S CALLED
WHITE RHINO MARBLE.

19:11.518 --> 19:13.086
SO YOU REALLY DON'T
SEE THAT ANYWHERE ELSE.

19:13.119 --> 19:15.321
IT'S ONLY EXCAVATED
ONE PART IN THE WORLD,

19:15.355 --> 19:17.023
IN NAMIBIA,
WHICH IS IN, LIKE,

19:17.057 --> 19:18.124
THE PROVINCE OF...

19:18.158 --> 19:19.559
IT'S ALL THE WAY
IN SOUTHERN AFRICA,

19:19.592 --> 19:20.794
OR REALLY DOWN THERE.

19:20.827 --> 19:22.796
IN NAMIBIA,
25% OF THE COUNTRY'S REVENUE

19:22.829 --> 19:24.197
COMES FROM MINING.

19:24.230 --> 19:25.498
- HE'S DONE HIS HOMEWORK.

19:25.532 --> 19:27.434
HE KNOWS EVERY SINGLE THING
ABOUT THE APARTMENT.

19:27.467 --> 19:29.302
- NAMIBIA, AND HOW IMPORTANT
WHITE RHINO MARBLE

19:29.336 --> 19:30.370
IS TO THE PEOPLE OF NAMIBIA.

19:30.403 --> 19:33.106
- IT'S IMPRESSIVE.
YEAH.

19:36.076 --> 19:37.410
UM, THE ASK ON THIS IS...

19:37.444 --> 19:38.611
- $6 MILLION.

19:38.645 --> 19:40.313
- OKAY.
THIS IS--THIS IS A BIT MORE

19:40.347 --> 19:42.382
THAN WHAT THEY HAD ORIGINALLY
ANTICIPATED SPENDING.

19:42.415 --> 19:43.650
- MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT

19:43.683 --> 19:45.085
LAUREN'S CLIENT
REALLY TRUSTS HER,

19:45.118 --> 19:46.753
AND THEY'VE WORKED TOGETHER
FOR A WHILE,

19:46.786 --> 19:48.888
AND, YOU KNOW, HE'S GONNA
MAKE THE DECISION LATER ON

19:48.922 --> 19:51.691
AFTER SEEING THE PHOTOS AND
THE PICTURES AND FLOOR PLANS.

19:51.725 --> 19:53.893
I MEAN, I WOULD RECOMMEND,
YOU KNOW, PUTTING IN AN OFFER.

19:53.927 --> 19:55.795
- OKAY, WELL,
I'M GONNA SPEAK WITH HIM NOW.

19:55.829 --> 19:57.163
- OKAY.
- UM, IT WAS REALLY A PLEASURE.

19:57.197 --> 19:58.865
- THANK YOU.
- I CERTAINLY LEARNED MORE TODAY

19:58.898 --> 20:00.900
THAN I HAVE ON, UH,
ON ANY OTHER SHOWING.

20:00.934 --> 20:03.570
I KNOW ALL THE--
THE NAMIBIAN WHITE RHINO MARBLE.

20:03.603 --> 20:05.572
- THE NAMIBIAN-HONED
WHITE RHINO MARBLE. EXACTLY.

20:05.605 --> 20:08.174
- I'LL MAKE SURE
TO MENTION THAT TO HIM.

20:08.208 --> 20:10.744
- COMING UP...
- JOHN, WHERE ARE YOU?

20:10.777 --> 20:12.812
WE'RE STARTING NOW,
AND I NEED THE RENDERING.

20:12.846 --> 20:23.790
GET IN A CAB NOW AND HURRY.

20:23.823 --> 20:25.658
- ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT,
ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT.

20:25.692 --> 20:27.494
- HOWDY.
- BOOP.

20:27.527 --> 20:29.162
- RIGHT ON MY PILE.
- LOOK AT THESE.

20:29.195 --> 20:30.230
SORRY.
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

20:30.263 --> 20:31.297
OH, INVITATIONS.

20:31.331 --> 20:32.899
- GRAB A PEN AND START ROLLING,
MY FRIEND.

20:32.932 --> 20:35.035
- INVITATIONS FOR THE
INVITATION-ONLY OPEN HOUSE.

20:35.068 --> 20:38.004
LOOK AT THESE.
THESE ARE AWESOME.

20:38.038 --> 20:39.673
- SO YOU'RE GOING TO HELP.

20:39.706 --> 20:40.807
START ROLLING.

20:40.840 --> 20:42.175
THERE'S A PEN
RIGHT THERE FOR YOU.

20:42.208 --> 20:44.577
- I JUST DON'T THINK
I CAN STOP LOOKING AT THESE.

20:44.611 --> 20:47.180
EUGENE O'NEILL,
THEODORE ROOSEVELT, MARK TWAIN.

20:47.213 --> 20:49.015
WHO'S LIVED IN YOUR BUILDING?
THESE PEOPLE.

20:49.049 --> 20:54.187
I LOVE THIS.
THAT'S PERFECT. THAT'S PERFECT.

20:54.220 --> 20:55.955
I LOVE THIS.

20:55.989 --> 20:58.558
IN ADDITION TO BEING
A FORMER SOAP OPERA ACTOR,

20:58.591 --> 21:00.760
I ALSO USED TO BE
A PROFESSIONAL HAND MODEL.

21:00.794 --> 21:02.595
I MEAN, THESE BABIES
MADE A LOT OF MONEY,

21:02.629 --> 21:04.664
AND SO I CAN'T BE
STUFFING ENVELOPES

21:04.698 --> 21:06.066
AND GETTING PAPER CUTS.

21:06.099 --> 21:07.434
I MEAN, THAT'S CRAZY.

21:07.467 --> 21:10.537
BUT I GUESS I HAVE TO APPEAR
AS A TEAM PLAYER.

21:10.570 --> 21:11.938
- ATTA BOY.

21:11.971 --> 21:13.940
- AND I HAVE TO FOLD THIS
AND PUT IT IN THE ENVELOPES?

21:13.973 --> 21:15.108
- NO!
YOU'RE TRI-FOLDING IT.

21:15.141 --> 21:16.810
DID YOU NOT SEE ME
DO THE PAST 40 OF THESE?

21:16.843 --> 21:18.645
- NO, BECAUSE I WAS
SELLING REAL ESTATE.

21:18.678 --> 21:19.879
THAT'S WHY...

21:19.913 --> 21:21.381
- YEAH, OKAY.

21:21.414 --> 21:23.383
MOVING RIGHT ALONG,
YOU'RE HOLDING IT IN YOUR HAND.

21:23.416 --> 21:25.085
IN AND OVER.

21:25.085 --> 21:26.586
- IN AND OVER.

21:26.619 --> 21:28.521
- OKAY, AND THEN
YOU'RE GONNA TAKE YOUR PEN...

21:28.555 --> 21:29.756
- OOPS. WAIT.

21:29.789 --> 21:31.324
DO I GO TO A CERTAIN LINE?

21:31.358 --> 21:33.093
KEEP FORGETTING--
OH, WAIT, WAIT, WAIT, WAIT.

21:33.093 --> 21:34.561
- OKAY, FORGET IT.

21:34.594 --> 21:36.930
YOU JUST GO CALL THE CATERER
AND MAKE SURE EVERYTHING'S FINE,

21:36.963 --> 21:38.365
AND I'LL DO THIS MYSELF,

21:38.398 --> 21:40.533
BECAUSE I SEE WE'RE NEVER
GONNA GET ANYWHERE WITH YOU.

21:40.567 --> 21:42.135
- AWESOME, AWESOME IDEA.

21:42.168 --> 21:43.870
THANKS, DINA.
YOU'RE THE BEST.

21:43.903 --> 21:46.006
[whistles]

21:54.280 --> 21:55.382
- HI, GUYS.

21:55.415 --> 21:56.683
I'M CALLING
A MARKETING MEETING

21:56.716 --> 21:58.184
FOR 471 WASHINGTON.

21:58.218 --> 22:00.220
THE BROKER'S OPEN
IS IN LESS THAN A WEEK.

22:00.253 --> 22:01.221
I HAVE TO HAVE A FLOOR PLAN.

22:01.254 --> 22:02.222
I HAVE TO HAVE A BROCHURE.

22:02.255 --> 22:03.223
I HAVE TO HAVE A WEB SITE UP.

22:03.256 --> 22:04.424
I HAVE TO HAVE
EVERYTHING READY

22:04.457 --> 22:05.458
SO I CAN START SELLING.

22:05.492 --> 22:06.559
THERE'S A LOT
OF MOVING PARTS.

22:06.593 --> 22:07.827
A LOT OF DIFFERENT PEOPLE.

22:07.861 --> 22:09.496
I WANTED TO DO IT
AT THE ARCHITECT'S OFFICE

22:09.529 --> 22:11.197
SO WE'RE ALL IN A GROUP,

22:11.231 --> 22:13.833
AND EVERYBODY IS ON
THE SAME PAGE, MOVING FORWARD.

22:13.867 --> 22:16.636
I WANT TO SAY FIRST
I'M REALLY PROUD OF EVERYBODY.

22:16.670 --> 22:19.272
I CAN'T THINK
OF ANY OTHER TEAM OR COMPANY

22:19.305 --> 22:20.507
THAT IS THIS ORGANIZED,

22:20.540 --> 22:22.442
WITH THESE KIND OF PEOPLE,
THESE GENIUSES,

22:22.475 --> 22:24.911
UH, FOR THE COLLATERAL
MATERIAL ON THE BUILDING.

22:24.944 --> 22:26.446
THE DIFFICULTY
WITH THIS PROCESS,

22:26.479 --> 22:28.281
IT'S THAT IT'S
A CREATIVE PROCESS,

22:28.314 --> 22:29.849
AND YOU CAN'T FORCE
CREATIVE PEOPLE

22:29.883 --> 22:31.217
TO COME UP
WITH A BEAUTIFUL LOGO

22:31.251 --> 22:32.919
AND BEAUTIFUL RENDERINGS
AND FLOOR PLANS,

22:32.952 --> 22:35.088
UNLESS YOU ALSO GIVE THEM
SOME LOVE AND ENERGY.

22:35.121 --> 22:37.824
HOWEVER, AS YOU KNOW,
WE'RE REALLY BEHIND.

22:37.857 --> 22:40.427
THE SIGN IS SUPPOSED TO BE UP,
LIKE, TWO WEEKS AGO,

22:40.460 --> 22:41.695
AND I DON'T EVEN
HAVE A BROCHURE.

22:41.728 --> 22:43.096
I DON'T HAVE RENDERINGS.

22:43.096 --> 22:44.998
I DON'T HAVE A FLOOR PLAN.
I'M REALLY WORRIED.

22:45.098 --> 22:46.633
WHERE ARE WE
WITH THE FLOOR PLANS?

22:46.666 --> 22:48.968
- LET'S LET CASANDRA SHOW THE
CONCEPT THAT SHE'S WORKING ON.

22:49.002 --> 22:50.770
- RIGHT. SO WE HAD TALKED
ABOUT THE FLOOR PLANS

22:50.804 --> 22:52.238
BEING PART OF THE BROCHURES.

22:52.272 --> 22:55.408
- OKAY, SO I THINK THIS NEEDS
TO BE MUCH LARGER.

22:55.442 --> 22:57.711
AS A BUYER, YOU WANT TO KIND OF
LOOK AT THE DIMENSIONS.

22:57.744 --> 22:59.012
YOU EVEN WANT TO TAKE A PEN

22:59.112 --> 23:01.047
AND DRAW IN YOUR BED
AND THE FURNITURE, INTO THE--

23:01.081 --> 23:02.649
INTO THE--AND YOU CAN'T
REALLY DO THAT,

23:02.682 --> 23:03.783
'CAUSE IT'S SO SMALL.

23:03.817 --> 23:06.252
IT'S VERY FAR FROM DONE.

23:06.286 --> 23:08.254
IT'S A MESS.
IT'S--IT'S DISAPPOINTING.

23:08.288 --> 23:10.457
UH, WEB SITE. CASANDRA.
DO WE HAVE ANYTHING?

23:10.490 --> 23:11.691
WHAT'S THE DATE ON THAT?

23:11.725 --> 23:14.060
- AS SOON AS THESE THINGS
GO OFF TO PRINT,

23:14.060 --> 23:16.396
THEN WE'LL TACKLE
THE WEB SITE.

23:16.429 --> 23:18.064
- SOMETIMES I HAVE
TO BE A HARD ASS.

23:18.064 --> 23:19.432
I HAVE TO CRACK THE WHIP.

23:19.466 --> 23:20.600
I HAVE TO GET RESULTS.

23:20.633 --> 23:23.069
SO A $45 MILLION SELLOUT
IS NOT GONNA BE EASY.

23:23.069 --> 23:24.237
THE SIGN
NEEDS TO GO UP QUICKLY.

23:24.270 --> 23:25.972
THE FLOOR PLANS,
THE WEB SITE, THE BROCHURE,

23:26.072 --> 23:27.073
LOT OF WORK.

23:27.107 --> 23:28.441
AND YOU GUYS,
WE GOT TO SELL IT NOW.

23:41.121 --> 23:42.789
- UGH.

23:42.822 --> 23:45.959
I PLANNED TO HAVE THE OPEN HOUSE
ON A BEAUTIFUL, SUNNY DAY.

23:45.992 --> 23:48.795
I CHECKED THE WEATHER REPORT.
IT'S GONNA BE NICE.

23:48.828 --> 23:50.830
EVERYONE'S GONNA BE ABLE
TO SEE THE PARK FOR THE LISTING,

23:50.864 --> 23:51.831
AND THEN BOOM.

23:51.865 --> 23:53.099
[thunder rumbles]

23:53.099 --> 23:57.137
IT RAINS.
ARE YOU KIDDING ME?

23:57.170 --> 23:58.938
BUT IT'S OKAY.

23:58.972 --> 24:01.241
I WILL SELL THIS APARTMENT
RAIN OR SHINE, BABY.

24:01.274 --> 24:04.911
[sighs]

24:04.944 --> 24:07.180
ALL RIGHT.
SO CAN WE DO, LIKE, A TEST RUN?

24:07.213 --> 24:08.548
- YEAH, SURE.

24:08.581 --> 24:09.649
- MY IDEA FOR THE OPEN HOUSE

24:09.683 --> 24:10.917
IS TO KIND OF
GIVE IT A THEME.

24:10.950 --> 24:12.152
- SO, BASICALLY...

24:12.185 --> 24:14.421
SO IT'S GONNA BE
A GRAMERCY PARK MARTINI,

24:14.454 --> 24:16.189
AND YOU'RE GONNA PUT
A LITTLE TULIP IN IT,

24:16.222 --> 24:17.757
BECAUSE RIGHT NOW,
THE GRAMERCY PARK,

24:17.791 --> 24:19.059
IT'S IN BLOOM.
IT'S FULL OF TULIPS.

24:19.059 --> 24:20.593
GET PEOPLE,
YOU KNOW, IN THAT MOOD.

24:20.627 --> 24:22.595
FLOWERS.
HELP PEOPLE BUY THINGS.

24:22.629 --> 24:23.897
SEE, THAT LOOKS PRETTY COOL.

24:23.930 --> 24:26.900
- LOOKS GOOD.
[doorbell rings]

24:26.933 --> 24:28.068
- HELLO.
- HELLO. HI, HELLO.

24:28.068 --> 24:29.102
- HOW ARE YOU?
RYAN SERHANT.

24:29.135 --> 24:30.904
- HI.
HOW YOU DOING? JOHN.

24:30.937 --> 24:32.272
- JOHN.
- HI, RYAN. NICE TO MEET YOU.

24:32.305 --> 24:33.306
RICK PRESCOTT.

24:33.340 --> 24:34.407
- GOOD TO MEET YOU.
WELCOME.

24:34.441 --> 24:35.408
- THANK YOU.

24:35.442 --> 24:37.911
- BEHIND YOU.

24:37.944 --> 24:39.079
WE HAVE, UH, SOME MARTINIS

24:39.079 --> 24:40.714
AND SOME CRACKERS AND CAVIAR
SET UP FOR YOU.

24:40.747 --> 24:42.315
- OH, THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
- AWESOME. THANK YOU.

24:42.349 --> 24:43.883
- I WILL TAKE A MARTINI.
THANK YOU.

24:55.962 --> 24:57.097
- SO WITH EACH PURCHASE,

24:57.097 --> 25:01.301
YOU GET A DEEDED KEY
TO GRAMERCY PARK.

25:01.334 --> 25:02.569
HOW DO YOU LIKE IT SO FAR?

25:02.602 --> 25:06.072
- I LOVE THE WAY THEY RESTORED
THE CROWN MOLDINGS

25:06.106 --> 25:08.675
AND THE DETAILS
FROM THE ORIGINAL BUILDING.

25:08.708 --> 25:10.276
- THIS IS ABSOLUTELY BEAUTIFUL.

25:10.310 --> 25:11.711
- SO IT'S A THREE-BEDROOM,
THREE BATH.

25:11.745 --> 25:12.679
NOW,
THIS IS A COMBO UNIT.

25:12.712 --> 25:13.713
- OKAY.

25:13.747 --> 25:14.881
- 2,164 SQUARE FEET.

25:14.914 --> 25:15.849
- OKAY.

25:15.882 --> 25:17.851
- I--I THINK I LOVE THIS ONE.

25:17.884 --> 25:19.219
- EVERYONE LOVES THE APARTMENT.

25:19.252 --> 25:22.756
BUT THIS GUY JASPER SEEMS
PARTICULARLY TAKEN WITH IT.

25:22.789 --> 25:24.758
I DON'T KNOW EXACTLY
WHAT YOUR UNCLE IS LOOKING FOR.

25:24.791 --> 25:27.060
IS HE INTERESTED
IN LOCATION MORE,

25:27.060 --> 25:28.361
OR IS IT BUILDING TYPE
OR HISTORY?

25:28.395 --> 25:29.596
- SOMETHING WITH CHARACTER.

25:29.629 --> 25:31.164
SOMETHING--
SOME HISTORY BEHIND.

25:31.197 --> 25:33.800
- RIGHT, WELL, THAT'S--
I MEAN, THAT'S THIS BUILDING.

25:33.833 --> 25:35.535
I MEAN, THE RINGLING BROTHERS
LIVED HERE.

25:35.568 --> 25:36.836
THEODORE ROOSEVELT
LIVED HERE.

25:36.870 --> 25:38.104
THERE'S A LOT--
A LOT OF CHARACTER

25:38.138 --> 25:41.207
THAT JUST BASICALLY
HAS BLED INTO THESE FLOORS.

25:41.241 --> 25:43.443
AND YOU DON'T GET THAT
IN OTHER PARTS OF THE CITY.

25:43.476 --> 25:45.078
JASPER'S UNCLE
WORKS IN HONG KONG,

25:45.111 --> 25:48.314
AND HE SENT JASPER,
ALONG WITH HIS BROKER, EDWARD,

25:48.348 --> 25:50.950
OUT TO GET A NICE PLACE
IN MANHATTAN

25:50.984 --> 25:53.086
FOR WHEN HE'S HERE
DOING BUSINESS IN THE CITY.

25:53.119 --> 25:55.622
- SO DO YOU THINK THIS BEDROOM
IS BIG ENOUGH FOR YOUR UNCLE?

25:55.655 --> 25:57.390
- OF COURSE.
IT'S GREAT LIGHT IN HERE.

25:57.424 --> 25:59.325
THINK, YEAH,
HE'LL LIKE THAT A LOT.

25:59.359 --> 26:00.860
GET A LITTLE PICTURE.

26:04.931 --> 26:06.232
- THANK YOU SO MUCH.

26:06.266 --> 26:08.134
- I DID EVERYTHING
I COULD TODAY.

26:08.168 --> 26:09.336
THE TURNOUT WAS HUGE.

26:09.369 --> 26:11.171
THERE WAS GENUINE INTEREST
IN THE APARTMENT.

26:11.204 --> 26:13.873
UNFORTUNATELY, MAURICE MANN
WON'T CARE ABOUT ANY OF THAT

26:13.907 --> 26:15.542
WITHOUT AN OFFER.

26:27.721 --> 26:29.856
- OKAY, SO LET'S GET THESE OUT.

26:29.889 --> 26:32.525
WE HAVE FOUR BOXES,
BROCHURES.

26:32.559 --> 26:34.461
FINALLY,
THE DAY OF THE OPEN HOUSE,

26:34.494 --> 26:36.496
THIS MORNING,
THE MARKETING MATERIAL ARRIVES.

26:36.529 --> 26:38.298
WE HAVE, LIKE, 70 BROKERS
COMING IN HALF AN HOUR.

26:38.331 --> 26:39.466
COME ON.

26:39.499 --> 26:41.067
SO WE'RE, LIKE,
CARRYING OUT THESE BOXES,

26:41.101 --> 26:42.802
AND WE HAVE TO PUT TOGETHER
100 FOLDERS

26:42.836 --> 26:43.870
WITHIN FOUR MINUTES.

26:43.903 --> 26:45.772
WE HAVE ABOUT 25 MINUTES.

26:45.805 --> 26:48.108
SO ORGANIZE THIS,
PUT THE RENDERINGS UP,

26:48.141 --> 26:49.909
GET THE COFFEE,
AND I'M GONNA CALL JOHN.

26:49.943 --> 26:51.144
- ALL RIGHT.
THE PRESSURE'S ON.

26:56.383 --> 26:58.818
- JOHN.
WHERE ARE YOU?

26:58.852 --> 27:01.021
I MEAN...
YEAH, YEAH.

27:01.021 --> 27:03.023
OKAY, GOOD. HURRY,
BECAUSE WE'RE STARTING NOW,

27:03.023 --> 27:04.157
AND I NEED THE RENDERING.

27:04.190 --> 27:06.126
GET--GET IN A CAB NOW
AND HURRY.

27:06.159 --> 27:07.093
THANK YOU.

27:07.127 --> 27:08.762
- MY TEAM MEMBER JOHN
IS LATE.

27:08.795 --> 27:11.731
HE HAS THE RENDERING
OF THE FINISHED UNIT.

27:11.765 --> 27:13.767
WITHOUT IT, I HAVE NOTHING
TO SHOW FOR THESE BROKERS,

27:13.800 --> 27:15.168
EXCEPT SHEETROCK AND CONCRETE.

27:15.201 --> 27:17.170
WELL, YOU KNOW,
I HAVE 14 MINUTES,

27:17.203 --> 27:19.406
AND I HAVE, YOU KNOW,
THE ENTIRE CORPORATE COMMUNITY,

27:19.439 --> 27:21.474
ALL THE TOP BROKERS IN THE CITY
ARE ON THEIR WAY HERE,

27:21.508 --> 27:23.043
SO I JUST NEED THIS
TO HAPPEN RIGHT NOW.

27:23.043 --> 27:24.310
I UNDERSTAND.
I UNDERSTAND.

27:24.344 --> 27:26.112
I KNOW IT'S HARD TO GET A CAB
IN NEW YORK CITY.

27:26.146 --> 27:28.281
THAT'S WHY SOME PEOPLE HAVE,
YOU KNOW, THEIR OWN CAR.

27:28.314 --> 27:31.284
AS NEW YORKERS, WE ALL DEAL
WITH CRAZY TRAFFIC EVERY DAY.

27:31.317 --> 27:32.485
IT DRIVES ME NUTS WHEN PEOPLE

27:32.519 --> 27:34.087
DON'T FACTOR THIS
INTO THEIR SCHEDULES.

27:34.120 --> 27:36.056
WHERE ARE YOU?
OKAY, TWO BLOCKS AWAY.

27:36.089 --> 27:38.358
HURRY, HURRY, HURRY.

27:43.296 --> 27:44.798
OH, THANK GOD.

27:44.831 --> 27:45.965
- HEY. OKAY.

27:46.066 --> 27:47.400
- OKAY, THIS IS IT?
THIS IS THE RENDERING?

27:47.434 --> 27:48.435
- YUP.

27:48.468 --> 27:49.769
- OH, IT'S BIGGER
THAN I THOUGHT.

27:49.803 --> 27:50.837
OH, LET ME SEE.
OKAY, THIS--

27:50.870 --> 27:51.838
- SEE HOW THIS THING LOOKS.

27:51.871 --> 27:52.872
- [imitates drum roll]

27:52.906 --> 27:57.210
- I KNOW, I KNOW.

27:57.243 --> 27:58.912
- CAN WE GO A LITTLE FURTHER?
DOES IT FIT?

27:58.945 --> 28:01.414
- YEAH.

28:01.448 --> 28:03.183
- DID I DO THAT?

28:03.216 --> 28:05.085
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN
DID YOU DO THAT?

28:05.118 --> 28:06.686
I DID THAT.

28:06.720 --> 28:08.388
- NO, IT'S SO STRAIGHT.
IT'S SO PERFECT.

28:08.421 --> 28:10.590
OKAY, I GOT TO GO DOWN
AND CHECK ON ARIEL

28:10.623 --> 28:12.258
FOR THE FLOOR PLANS
AND THE BROCHURES.

28:12.292 --> 28:13.226
WILL YOU STAY HERE?
- OKAY.

28:13.259 --> 28:15.829
- MAYBE, UM...
- CLEAN UP?

28:15.862 --> 28:17.030
- OKAY, WE GOT TO HURRY.

28:17.063 --> 28:19.032
- I KNOW. I'M TRYING.
GOING AS FAST AS I CAN.

28:19.032 --> 28:20.734
OKAY, AND THEN THERE
ARE BROKERS COMING NOW.

28:20.767 --> 28:22.302
- THERE ARE BROKERS HERE?
THE FIRST ONES?

28:22.335 --> 28:23.403
OKAY, LET'S DO THIS.
- OKAY.

28:23.436 --> 28:24.704
- IT'S GAME TIME.

28:24.738 --> 28:26.439
- WHAT HAPPENS
IF I DON'T WEAR A HAT?

28:26.473 --> 28:27.640
- IT'S A CONSTRUCTION SITE.

28:27.674 --> 28:29.142
- CAN I GET
A DIFFERENT COLOR HAT?

28:29.175 --> 28:31.611
- THIS ISN'T A LABOR-DAY SALE
AT BLOOMINGDALE'S

28:31.644 --> 28:33.747
WHERE YOU GET THINGS AT, UH,
THESE TYPES OF DISCOUNTS.

28:33.780 --> 28:34.881
- I DON'T MEAN
TO PLAY HARDBALL,

28:34.914 --> 28:39.352
BUT WE CAN GO
SOMEWHERE ELSE.

28:42.288 --> 28:44.224
[knock on door]
- MICHAEL LORBER.

28:44.257 --> 28:45.258
- WHAT'S UP?

28:45.291 --> 28:46.760
- REAL ESTATE MAGNATE
EXTRAORDINAIRE.

28:46.793 --> 28:48.194
WHAT'S HAPPENING TODAY?
- NOT MUCH.

28:48.228 --> 28:50.196
- BUSINESS HEATING UP?
A LITTLE SWEAT TREATMENT?

28:50.230 --> 28:51.398
- EXACTLY.

28:51.431 --> 28:53.133
- ALL RIGHT. WE'RE GONNA
GET YOU INTO A GOWN.

28:53.166 --> 28:55.101
WE'RE GONNA LUBE YOU UP
FOR A COUPLE MINUTES.

28:55.135 --> 28:57.070
YOU KNOW, IT'S ABOUT
10, 15 LITTLE SHOTS ON EACH ONE.

28:57.070 --> 28:58.171
- RIGHT.

28:58.204 --> 29:00.240
- I SWEAT PROFUSELY
OUT OF MY ARMPITS.

29:00.273 --> 29:01.875
IT'S ACTUALLY
A MEDICAL CONDITION

29:01.908 --> 29:03.143
CALLED HYPERHIDROSIS,

29:03.176 --> 29:04.611
WHICH JUST MEANS
EXCESSIVE SWEATING.

29:04.644 --> 29:06.913
- I'M GONNA MAKE YOU COMFORTABLE
BEFORE I TORTURE YOU HERE.

29:07.013 --> 29:08.014
- AS IT TURNS OUT,

29:08.014 --> 29:10.183
BOTOX CAN BE INJECTED
IN YOUR ARMPITS

29:10.216 --> 29:11.618
TO REDUCE THE SWEATING.

29:11.651 --> 29:14.788
SO TWICE A YEAR
I GET INJECTIONS IN MY ARMPIT

29:14.821 --> 29:16.156
TO REDUCE THE SWEATING.

29:16.189 --> 29:17.757
AAH.

29:17.791 --> 29:19.926
YOU KNOW,
I'VE TRIED EVERY DEODORANT,

29:20.026 --> 29:23.763
ANTIPERSPIRANT, BUT, UH,
NOTHING REALLY SEEMS TO...

29:23.797 --> 29:25.265
AAH.
IS IT BLEEDING?

29:25.298 --> 29:28.034
- NO. GOD,
I THOUGH YOU WERE TOUGH.

29:28.034 --> 29:29.369
- YOU'RE PUNCHING HOLES
IN MY SKIN.

29:29.402 --> 29:30.603
- NO,
WE'RE NOT PUNCHING HOLES.

29:30.637 --> 29:33.039
WE'RE GENTLY INFUSING...
- INFUSING.

29:33.073 --> 29:34.741
- AN ANTIPERSPIRANT MEDICATION.

29:34.774 --> 29:37.577
- ANTIPERSPIRANT.
IS IT SCENTED?

29:42.248 --> 29:43.583
- YES, YOU DEFINITELY
HAVE TO HAVE HATS.

29:43.616 --> 29:45.285
- YEAH, YOU GOT TO WEAR
CONSTRUCTION HATS.

29:45.318 --> 29:46.686
- YOU GUYS ARE THE FIRST ONES.

29:46.720 --> 29:48.154
- WE ARE?
- YOU ARE.

29:48.188 --> 29:49.622
YOU'RE THE LUCKY LADIES.

29:49.656 --> 29:51.124
- LOOK HOW BEAUTIFUL
THE BUILDING IS.

29:51.157 --> 29:52.859
YOU'RE STANDING RIGHT HERE--
- IT'S GORGEOUS.

29:52.892 --> 29:54.561
- YOU'RE STANDING RIGHT HERE
IN THE GARDEN

29:54.594 --> 29:56.596
AND YOU'RE LOOKING UP
ON THE BUILDING.

29:58.064 --> 29:59.265
- COME ON, GUYS.

29:59.299 --> 30:00.667
FLOOR TO CEILING GLASS.

30:00.700 --> 30:02.335
IT'S A GERMAN SYSTEM
CALLED SCHUCO.

30:02.369 --> 30:04.904
IT'S PIN-DROP QUIET,
WHICH IS IMPORTANT,

30:04.938 --> 30:06.406
BECAUSE WE HAVE CANAL
RIGHT THERE TO OUR NORTH.

30:06.439 --> 30:08.174
YOU KNOW,
WHEN YOU'RE SELLING

30:08.208 --> 30:09.676
A BEAUTIFUL APARTMENT
TOWNHOUSE THAT'S ALREADY DONE,

30:09.709 --> 30:11.144
YOU CAN KIND OF STEP BACK

30:11.177 --> 30:13.413
AND HAVE THE CLIENT WALK AROUND
AND JUST TAKE IT ALL IN.

30:13.446 --> 30:15.382
SELLING AN UNFINISHED
BUILDING LIKE THIS

30:15.415 --> 30:17.417
IS A LOT MORE
ABOUT MY PERFORMANCE.

30:17.450 --> 30:19.319
CENTRAL AC, WALK-IN,

30:19.352 --> 30:20.620
AND A BEAUTIFUL BATHROOM.

30:22.288 --> 30:23.423
12 UNITS IN THE BUILDING.

30:23.456 --> 30:25.225
- AND IS THERE
A DAYTIME DOORMAN OR FULL-TIME?

30:25.258 --> 30:26.459
- 24-HOUR DOORMAN.

30:27.894 --> 30:30.430
- 2,750,000.

30:30.463 --> 30:31.431
- VERY GOOD TO SEE YOU.

30:31.464 --> 30:32.599
- GOOD TO SEE YOU.

30:32.632 --> 30:34.100
MWAH. MWAH.

30:34.134 --> 30:35.769
- SUCH A HANDSOME MAN.

30:35.802 --> 30:37.070
HEY. HOW ARE YOU?
GOOD TO SEE YOU.

30:37.103 --> 30:38.104
- HEY.

30:38.138 --> 30:39.439
- HEY. YOU--
YOU HAVE TO DO A HAT.

30:39.472 --> 30:40.907
- MY HAT?
- IT'S A CONSTRUCTION SITE.

30:40.940 --> 30:42.308
- WHAT HAPPENS
IF I DON'T WEAR A HAT?

30:42.342 --> 30:43.443
- IT'S A CONSTRUCTION SITE.

30:43.476 --> 30:44.744
- CAN I GET A DIFFERENT
COLOR HAT?

30:44.778 --> 30:46.312
- I'M GONNA TAKE ANOTHER ONE.
WEAR MINE.

30:46.346 --> 30:47.781
- I CAN WEAR YOUR HAT?
- COME ON, GUYS.

30:47.814 --> 30:50.350
- I SAW THERE WAS AN OPEN HOUSE
AT 417 WASHINGTON,

30:50.383 --> 30:53.453
AND I HAD A HALF AN HOUR TO KILL
BEFORE MY NEXT SHOWING,

30:53.486 --> 30:56.890
SO I FIGURED, YOU KNOW, WHY NOT
SWING BY AND CHECK IT OUT?

30:56.923 --> 31:01.061
AND, YOU KNOW, IT'S...
IT'S ALWAYS NICE TO SEE FREDRIK.

31:01.061 --> 31:03.063
- IT'S A TWO BEDROOM,
2 1/2 BATH.

31:03.063 --> 31:04.364
2,000 SQUARE FEET.

31:04.397 --> 31:05.699
YOU HAVE TO WEAR THE HAT.

31:07.067 --> 31:10.737
RYAN IS SO VAIN HE WON'T WEAR
A CONSTRUCTION HAT.

31:10.770 --> 31:14.207
AT LEAST IT'LL COVER UP
ALL THAT GRAY.

31:18.578 --> 31:19.779
- OH, THIS FITS MUCH BETTER.

31:19.813 --> 31:21.915
- HE NEEDS TO BE THE CENTER
OF ATTENTION.

31:21.948 --> 31:23.083
NO ONE IS MORE SPECIAL.

31:23.083 --> 31:25.085
EVERYBODY NEEDS
TO WEAR THEIR HAT.

31:25.118 --> 31:28.088
AND BE QUIET
WHILE I'M TALKING.

31:28.088 --> 31:31.358
- OKAY.
I'M SORRY ABOUT THE NOISE, GUYS.

31:31.391 --> 31:32.492
IT'S A CONSTRUCTION SITE,

31:32.525 --> 31:33.993
AND THEY'VE BEEN
VERY, VERY AGGRESSIVE

31:34.094 --> 31:36.629
ABOUT THE FINISH DATE.

31:36.663 --> 31:37.964
- WHAT DO YOU THINK?

31:47.407 --> 31:49.709
- IT IS ON CANAL.

31:49.743 --> 31:51.011
SO, I MEAN,
THE FIRST THING I THINK

31:51.111 --> 31:52.612
WHEN I THINK OF THIS BUILDING
IS, YOU KNOW,

31:52.645 --> 31:54.581
I HOPE THERE'S AN ORDER
OF GENERAL TSO'S CHICKEN

31:54.614 --> 31:55.582
FOR EVERY APARTMENT SOLD.

31:55.615 --> 31:57.617
I MEAN,
THAT WOULD MAKE ME BUY.

32:04.257 --> 32:06.059
FREDRIK'S LISTING
ISN'T REALLY ON WASHINGTON.

32:06.059 --> 32:07.127
IT'S ON CANAL STREET.

32:07.160 --> 32:08.261
HE'S FUDGING THE LOCATION,

32:08.294 --> 32:09.662
SO EVERYONE WHO BUYS
IN THE BUILDING

32:09.696 --> 32:11.131
CAN SAY THEY LIVE
ON WASHINGTON,

32:11.164 --> 32:14.100
BECAUSE THAT'S SYNONYMOUS
WITH TRIBECA AND THE VILLAGE.

32:14.134 --> 32:17.604
CANAL IS SYNONYMOUS
WITH CHINATOWN

32:17.637 --> 32:21.408
AND A PLACE WHERE YOU CAN GET
KNOCKOFF HANDBAGS.

32:21.441 --> 32:23.476
THAT'S WHAT IT'S KNOWN FOR.

32:23.510 --> 32:25.612
- DID YOU READ THE ARTICLE IN
THE NEW YORK POST THIS WEEKEND?

32:25.645 --> 32:29.082
THAT THE SOUTH--
SOUTH OF SOHO, NORTH OF TRIBECA

32:29.115 --> 32:30.917
IS, LIKE, THE AREA
WHERE EVERYBODY WANTS TO BE.

32:30.950 --> 32:32.085
CANAL STREET.
- RIGHT.

32:32.118 --> 32:36.423
- CHINATOWN IS ACTUALLY,
LIKE, 15 BLOCKS AWAY,

32:36.456 --> 32:37.791
SO YOU'RE DEFINITELY
IN TRIBECA,

32:37.824 --> 32:39.392
WHICH IS THE MOST EXPENSIVE
PART OF NEW YORK,

32:39.426 --> 32:40.660
AND THE BEST SCHOOL DISTRICT.

32:40.694 --> 32:42.729
WHO SAID IT WAS CHINATOWN?

32:42.762 --> 32:45.198
- JUST A LITTLE--IT'S CLOSE
TO CANAL STREET, RIGHT?

32:45.231 --> 32:47.367
- CANAL STREET? YEAH, BUT
CHINATOWN IS ON THE EAST SIDE.

32:47.400 --> 32:48.902
WE'RE ON THE WEST SIDE.
DO YOU KNOW DOWNTOWN?

32:48.935 --> 32:50.103
- YEAH, ABSOLUTELY.

32:50.136 --> 32:51.571
- OKAY, GREAT.
SO YOU KNOW THIS IS TRIBECA,

32:51.604 --> 32:52.806
THE MOST EXPENSIVE PART
OF THE CITY.

32:54.507 --> 32:57.510
I'M REALLY SURPRISED
THAT RYAN ACTUALLY THINKS

32:57.544 --> 32:59.879
TRIBECA IS CHINATOWN.

32:59.913 --> 33:01.581
IT'S, LIKE...

33:01.614 --> 33:03.817
SWEDEN AND, LIKE,
SWITZERLAND.

33:03.850 --> 33:06.219
THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR COMING.
I REALLY APPRECIATE IT.

33:06.252 --> 33:07.520
I'M VERY HAPPY
ABOUT THE TURNOUT.

33:07.554 --> 33:08.822
AND IT ALL CAME TOGETHER,

33:08.855 --> 33:10.357
AND EVERYBODY WANTED
TO COME INTO THAT BUILDING

33:10.390 --> 33:11.558
AT THE SAME TIME.

33:11.591 --> 33:13.259
YOU WANT TO STAY AROUND,
OR YOU'RE LEAVING?

33:13.293 --> 33:14.794
- I--I GOT TO GO.
I HAVE AN APPOINTMENT.

33:14.828 --> 33:16.296
- OR YOU'RE TAKING A CAB
TO CHINATOWN?

33:16.329 --> 33:18.631
- I DON'T HAVE TO TAKE CAB.
I CAN WALK.

33:29.075 --> 33:30.677
- LOOK, REAL ESTATE
IN NEW YORK CITY

33:30.710 --> 33:32.479
IS INCREDIBLY STRESSFUL,

33:32.512 --> 33:34.547
AND IN ORDER
TO CALM MYSELF DOWN,

33:34.581 --> 33:38.084
I BOX, I WORK OUT, I UNWIND
WITH A GIRL EVERY NOW AND THEN.

33:38.084 --> 33:39.986
BUT A FRIEND RECENTLY TOLD ME
ABOUT ACUPUNCTURE.

33:40.086 --> 33:41.521
SO I FIGURED,
YOU KNOW, WHY NOT?

33:41.554 --> 33:43.189
- LET'S HAVE YOU COME LIE DOWN.

33:43.223 --> 33:44.591
I'LL COVER YOU UP WITH THIS.
- SURE.

33:44.624 --> 33:46.593
- FACE RIGHT DOWN
INTO THAT CRADLE THERE.

33:46.626 --> 33:48.661
- SO THIS IS WHERE
YOU START TO FEEL IT,

33:48.695 --> 33:49.896
ALONG THE CENTER HERE?

33:49.929 --> 33:52.232
OR DOES IT HAPPEN ON BOTH SIDES
OR EITHER SIDE?

33:52.265 --> 33:54.334
- BOTH SIDES
AND THEN INTO THE SHOULDERS.

33:54.367 --> 33:56.202
- THAT IS YOUR DRAGON TAIL.

33:56.236 --> 33:59.239
- THAT'S NOT WEIRD AT ALL.

33:59.272 --> 34:02.042
- YOU MIGHT FEEL
A LITTLE PINCH.

34:02.042 --> 34:03.877
- [exhales]

34:03.910 --> 34:05.712
OOH.

34:05.745 --> 34:07.147
- LITTLE PUNCH?
- LITTLE PINCH.

34:07.180 --> 34:09.049
OOH.
IT FEELS WEIRD.

34:09.049 --> 34:11.084
- HOW YOU DOING?
- ARE WE DONE?

34:11.117 --> 34:13.319
- ONE MORE IN YOUR BACK.

34:13.353 --> 34:15.855
- OOH.

34:15.889 --> 34:17.757
OH. OOH.
THAT IS WEIRD.

34:17.791 --> 34:22.195
THAT IS WEIRD.
THAT FEELS REALLY, REALLY WEIRD.

34:22.228 --> 34:24.330
- STROKING THE DRAGON'S TAIL.

34:24.364 --> 34:25.598
- OKAY.

34:25.632 --> 34:28.068
- THIS IS HELPING TO OPEN GATES
ALL OVER YOUR BODY,

34:28.068 --> 34:31.838
TO HELP THAT ENERGY, THAT CHI
MOVE SMOOTHLY THROUGHOUT.

34:31.871 --> 34:33.406
- GATES.
I'M OPENING THE GATES.

34:33.440 --> 34:34.841
OPEN GATES.

34:34.874 --> 34:36.843
SO I'M GONNA LEAVE YOU
WITH THESE FOR A FEW MINUTES.

34:36.876 --> 34:39.145
I'LL COME BACK.
WE'LL STROKE A FEW MORE TIMES.

34:39.179 --> 34:41.981
- WHAT'D YOU SAY?

34:42.082 --> 34:43.416
[cell phone rings]

34:43.450 --> 34:45.552
OOH.
IT'S WEIRD WHEN I MOVE.

34:45.585 --> 34:46.753
HELLO.

34:51.991 --> 34:54.594
UH...OH, THE OPEN HOUSE
FOR GRAMERCY.

34:54.627 --> 34:55.862
HEY, EDWARD.
WHAT'S GOING ON? OH.

35:02.135 --> 35:03.837
OKAY, PERFECT.

35:03.870 --> 35:05.505
ALL RIGHT, THANKS.
I'LL TALK TO YOU LATER.

35:05.538 --> 35:06.539
- TALK TO YOU LATER.
BYE.

35:06.573 --> 35:08.108
- OH. OOH. OOH.

35:18.418 --> 35:21.054
- HI, MICHAEL.
- HEY, LAUREN. HOW ARE YOU?

35:21.054 --> 35:22.155
- GOOD. HOW ARE YOU?

35:22.188 --> 35:23.690
- GOOD TO SEE YOU AGAIN.
- NICE TO SEE YOU.

35:23.723 --> 35:25.425
- THANKS FOR COMING UP.
- ABSOLUTELY.

35:25.458 --> 35:27.460
- THE SOONER A BROKER
GETS BACK TO YOU,

35:27.494 --> 35:29.963
THE MORE LIKELY IT IS
THAT A DEAL'S GONNA GET DONE.

35:30.063 --> 35:32.599
LAUREN CALLED ME
THE DAY AFTER OUR SHOWING.

35:32.632 --> 35:35.068
THIS COULD BE THE ONE.

35:35.101 --> 35:37.270
- I RECOMMENDED TO MY CLIENT,
OBVIOUSLY,

35:37.303 --> 35:38.471
THAT, UH, THAT I THINK

35:38.505 --> 35:40.140
IT'S A REALLY, REALLY
GREAT OPPORTUNITY,

35:40.173 --> 35:43.076
AND I, UM, I DEFINITELY
RESPECT AND UNDERSTAND

35:43.109 --> 35:45.578
THE SPONSOR'S ASKING PRICE,

35:45.612 --> 35:47.981
BUT WE REALLY FEEL
THAT THE PRICE PER SQUARE FOOT

35:48.081 --> 35:49.416
SHOULD BE MUCH LOWER.

35:49.449 --> 35:52.419
UM, JUST CONSIDERING
THAT IT'S A BIT FURTHER NORTH.

35:52.452 --> 35:55.288
AND, UNFORTUNATELY, MY BUYER,
WHILE HE'S VERY SERIOUS,

35:55.321 --> 35:56.690
HE JUST--
HE CANNOT OFFER ANYTHING

35:56.723 --> 35:59.626
MORE THAN 5.2 MILLION
AT THIS POINT.

36:02.195 --> 36:04.831
- 5.2...

36:07.200 --> 36:09.402
- YOU KNOW, THIS IS A REALLY
SPECIAL, UNIQUE PROJECT.

36:09.436 --> 36:10.470
- I UNDERSTAND.

36:10.503 --> 36:11.671
- YOU KNOW,
THIS ISN'T, YOU KNOW...

36:11.705 --> 36:13.606
A LABOR DAY SALE AT
BLOOMINGDALE'S, I GUESS,

36:13.640 --> 36:15.575
WHERE YOU GET THINGS
AT THESE TYPES OF DISCOUNTS.

36:15.608 --> 36:16.876
- IT'S A SIGNIFICANT DISCOUNT,

36:16.910 --> 36:18.778
BUT SEEING AS HOW
HIS ORIGINAL BUDGET

36:18.812 --> 36:20.780
WAS NO MORE THAN
4 1/2 MILLION,

36:20.814 --> 36:22.349
I'VE GOTTEN HIM UP THIS HIGH,

36:22.382 --> 36:24.351
AND YOU CAN, YOU KNOW,
GUARANTEE TO YOUR DEVELOPER

36:24.384 --> 36:25.752
THAT WE'RE GONNA
CLOSE QUICKLY

36:25.785 --> 36:27.420
AND IT'S GONNA BE
A SEAMLESS TRANSACTION,

36:27.454 --> 36:28.621
AND WE'RE OFFERING ALL CASH.

36:28.655 --> 36:31.091
- I JUST DON'T SEE
A DEAL GETTING DONE

36:31.124 --> 36:34.194
WITH, YOU KNOW,
THIS LOW A NUMBER.

36:34.227 --> 36:36.062
I JUST DON'T SEE IT.

36:36.062 --> 36:37.764
- HEY, I--I DON'T--
I DON'T MEAN TO PLAY HARDBALL,

36:37.797 --> 36:39.065
BUT WE CAN GO SOMEWHERE ELSE.

36:39.099 --> 36:40.767
I MEAN, I HAVE MY CLIENT.
HE'S READY TO BUY.

36:40.800 --> 36:41.968
I'VE GOTTEN HIM UP
QUITE A BIT

36:42.068 --> 36:43.470
ABOVE HIS ORIGINAL BUDGET.

36:43.503 --> 36:45.505
UM, AND--AND THAT'S REALLY--
THAT'S THE BEST I CAN DO.

36:45.538 --> 36:47.640
- LET ME CALL HIM RIGHT NOW.
I'LL BE RIGHT BACK.

36:47.674 --> 36:49.576
- OKAY. THANK YOU.

36:49.609 --> 36:53.480
- I'M REQUIRED TO PRESENT
EVERY OFFER TO TREVOR.

36:53.513 --> 36:56.316
[phone rings]

36:56.349 --> 36:58.318
- HELLO.
- HELLO, TREVOR?

36:58.351 --> 36:59.853
- MICHAEL.
HOW ARE YOU?

36:59.886 --> 37:02.055
- GOOD. HOW ARE YOU?
- GOOD. THANKS.

37:02.088 --> 37:03.390
- OH,
I HAVE A BROKER THAT'S HERE

37:03.423 --> 37:05.859
THAT REPRESENTS A BUYER.
- YEAH.

37:05.892 --> 37:07.761
- AND, YOU KNOW,
IT'S A GREAT BUYER.

37:07.794 --> 37:10.463
AN ALL-CASH OFFER.
- OKAY.

37:10.497 --> 37:15.335
- SO THEY'VE COME IN
AT 5.2 MILLION.

37:27.814 --> 37:29.949
- HAVE YOU BEEN HERE BEFORE?
- NO, NEVER.

37:30.050 --> 37:32.152
- THIS IS JUSTIN TIMBERLAKE'S
RESTAURANT.

37:32.185 --> 37:33.553
SOUTHERN HOSPITALITY.

37:33.586 --> 37:36.322
YEAH.

37:36.356 --> 37:38.458
BUT IT'S GOOD.
IT'S GOOD SOUTHERN FOOD.

37:38.491 --> 37:39.426
USUALLY WHEN I NEGOTIATE,

37:39.459 --> 37:41.261
I TRY TO CHARM THE BROKER.

37:41.294 --> 37:43.296
RIGHT?
MALE OR FEMALE.

37:43.329 --> 37:48.101
UM, BUT THIS GUY EDWARD
IS A TOUGH, TOUGH COOKIE.

37:48.134 --> 37:50.770
I MEAN, NOT A LOT OF PEOPLE
CAN RESIST THIS DIMPLE,

37:50.804 --> 37:52.906
BUT I THINK EDWARD
MIGHT BE ONE OF THEM.

37:52.939 --> 37:54.541
SO WHAT'S GOING ON?
WHAT DO YOU GOT FOR ME?

37:54.574 --> 37:56.710
- I HAVE SOME GREAT NEWS
FOR YOU, ACTUALLY.

37:56.743 --> 37:59.079
- THIS FOR GRAMERCY?
- YES.

37:59.079 --> 38:01.181
- I--I THINK
I LOVE THIS ONE.

38:01.214 --> 38:02.182
THE HISTORY, THE DETAILS.

38:02.215 --> 38:04.150
- YEAH.
- IT'S A GREAT SPACE.

38:04.184 --> 38:05.218
- I SPOKE WITH JASPER,

38:05.251 --> 38:08.021
AND HIS UNCLE
JUST GAVE ME AN OFFER.

38:08.021 --> 38:10.223
- OKAY.
- ALL CASH.

38:10.256 --> 38:12.392
4.6.

38:15.562 --> 38:16.930
- CAN HE COME UP?

38:17.030 --> 38:18.698
- HE DOESN'T WANT TO OVERPAY
FOR AN APARTMENT.

38:18.732 --> 38:19.766
YOU UNDERSTAND?

38:19.799 --> 38:21.101
- NO, HE'S NOT
OVERPAYING FOR IT.

38:21.134 --> 38:22.602
I MEAN, THE PRICE
IS VERY COMPETITIVE,

38:22.635 --> 38:23.803
BUT IT'S ALSO
DECENT AND FAIR.

38:23.837 --> 38:26.272
- HE'S NOT BUDGING AT ALL.

38:26.306 --> 38:28.842
- 4.6 CASH?
- YEAH, CASH.

38:28.875 --> 38:30.076
- I'M GONNA CALL HIM.

38:30.110 --> 38:31.378
I DON'T THINK
IT'S GONNA BE A DEAL,

38:31.411 --> 38:32.479
BUT I'LL CALL HIM,
ALL RIGHT?

38:32.512 --> 38:33.513
- PERFECT.

38:33.546 --> 38:34.748
- AND, UH,
I'LL GET US SOME FOOD.

38:34.781 --> 38:35.749
YOU HUNGRY?
- YES.

38:35.782 --> 38:39.319
THAT'S WHY WE'RE HERE, NO?

38:39.352 --> 38:41.488
[cell phone rings]

38:42.489 --> 38:43.923
- HEY, MAURICE.

38:43.957 --> 38:46.693
I'M SITTING WITH A BROKER
WHO CAME TO OUR OPEN HOUSE.

38:46.726 --> 38:48.528
AND HE'S GOT AN OFFER FOR ME.

38:48.561 --> 38:52.599
4.6 MILLION.
ALL CASH.

38:54.634 --> 38:57.904
- OKAY. I THINK I CAN GET
MAYBE 4.7 ALL CASH,

38:57.937 --> 38:59.873
IMMEDIATE CLOSING.

39:01.474 --> 39:02.742
CASH IS KING
IN NEW YORK CITY.

39:02.776 --> 39:04.844
AND 4.7 IS A GREAT OFFER,

39:04.878 --> 39:06.513
BUT BECAUSE OF
WHO MAURICE IS,

39:06.546 --> 39:08.114
I HAVE TO GET HIM
EVEN MORE MONEY

39:08.148 --> 39:09.582
SO I CAN PROVE MYSELF TO HIM.

39:09.616 --> 39:10.583
SO I TALKED TO MAURICE.

39:10.617 --> 39:12.318
- YEAH?
WHAT DID HE SAY?

39:12.352 --> 39:15.155

39:18.458 --> 39:20.660
SO HERE'S WHERE WE ARE.

39:20.694 --> 39:21.761

39:21.795 --> 39:26.066

BELOW 4.75.

39:26.099 --> 39:28.401
4.75 ALL CASH,
CLOSING IN 30 DAYS.

39:28.435 --> 39:30.470
THAT'S IT.
THAT'S THE BOTTOM PRICE.

39:30.503 --> 39:33.206
- WELL, THAT'S TOO MUCH.

39:33.239 --> 39:34.341
- THAT'S NOT TOO MUCH.

39:34.374 --> 39:36.076
LOOK, I KNOW YOUR BUYERS

39:36.109 --> 39:37.410
BETTER THAN
YOU KNOW YOUR BUYERS.

39:37.444 --> 39:41.281
IF THEY'VE GOT 4.6 CASH,
THEY HAVE 4.75 CASH.

39:48.521 --> 39:50.423
CALL THEM.
GET IT DONE.

39:50.457 --> 39:55.428
4.75,

39:55.462 --> 39:57.364
- ALL RIGHT, MAN.

40:16.049 --> 40:18.718
[sighs]

40:22.622 --> 40:24.357
[sighs]
HEY, RYAN.

40:24.391 --> 40:25.725
IT'S NOT GONNA WORK, MAN.

40:25.759 --> 40:27.761
I THINK YOUR RESPONSE
IS NOT SERIOUS.

40:27.794 --> 40:30.530
I MEAN, YOU'RE ABOUT
TO LOSE A DEAL BECAUSE 150k.

40:35.235 --> 40:37.237
I'M JUST KIDDING.
WE GOT THIS ONE.

40:37.270 --> 40:39.472
- YOU'RE SUCH AN [bleep].

40:39.506 --> 40:40.473
SO WE HAVE A DEAL?

40:40.507 --> 40:41.474

40:41.508 --> 40:42.776

SO 4.75.

40:42.809 --> 40:45.111
- YES, 4.75.

40:45.145 --> 40:47.047
[laughs]
- OKAY.

40:47.080 --> 40:48.081
AWESOME.

40:48.114 --> 40:49.449
- YOU'RE TOUGH, MAN.

40:49.482 --> 40:50.984
YOU'RE A REAL SHARK.

40:51.017 --> 40:52.952
- COMING UP...HE WASN'T
ECSTATIC ABOUT THE OFFER.

40:52.986 --> 40:53.953
- OKAY.

40:53.987 --> 40:54.954
- BUT HE CAME BACK
WITH A COUNTER

40:54.988 --> 40:56.189
THAT HE'S REALLY FIRM ON.

40:56.222 --> 40:58.191
YOU KNOW, AT THIS PRICE,
IT'S REALLY GOT TO GO.

41:09.736 --> 41:12.472
- THEY'VE COME IN
AT 5.2 MILLION.

41:13.840 --> 41:15.942
I KNOW THIS IS
A SUBSTANTIAL DISCOUNT.

41:15.975 --> 41:17.877
I MEAN,
THEY'RE A VERY SERIOUS OFFER.

41:17.911 --> 41:20.880
THEY'LL CLOSE RIGHT AWAY.
ALL CASH.

41:20.914 --> 41:22.982
YOU KNOW,
IT'S WHERE WE ARE NOW.

41:23.083 --> 41:24.918
THE LONGER A UNIT
SITS ON THE MARKET,

41:24.951 --> 41:26.586
WHETHER IT BE A DAY,
A WEEK, OR A MONTH,

41:26.619 --> 41:28.188
IT'S GOING DOWN IN PRICE.

41:28.221 --> 41:29.923
AND, YOU KNOW, I DON'T
WANT IT TO JUST SIT THERE.

41:29.956 --> 41:31.624
I WANT TO GET SOME DEALS
DONE IN THAT BUILDING.

41:31.658 --> 41:32.892
YOU KNOW,
THERE'S NOT MUCH LEFT,

41:32.926 --> 41:34.594
AND, YOU KNOW, BY JUST
SELLING OUT THE BUILDING,

41:34.627 --> 41:35.895
IT'S JUST GONNA MAKE IT
LOOK AMAZING,

AND FOR YOUR
NEXT PROJECTS TOO.

41:37.163 --> 41:39.366
YOU KNOW,

WALK AWAY FROM IT,

41:44.404 --> 41:45.739
AND, YOU KNOW, WE CAN--

41:45.772 --> 41:48.641
YOU CAN START
YOUR NEXT BUILDING.

41:52.112 --> 41:53.113
RIGHT.

41:53.113 --> 41:54.147
- GOT TO GET NORTH OF THAT.

41:54.180 --> 41:55.648
- OKAY.
I'M GONNA GO BACK IN THERE.
