WEBVTT

00:24.530 --> 00:25.925
What are you doing, man?
Tell me.

00:25.925 --> 00:27.688
Oh, listen up.
Pulling up to Jess' right now. So...

00:27.688 --> 00:29.953
- What? You're where?
- I mean Jess's.

00:30.060 --> 00:32.279
They escaped the whole thing braked up.
We could be here like crazy.

00:32.279 --> 00:33.699
You're nut. I thought I was a loser.

00:33.699 --> 00:35.192
What?

00:36.214 --> 00:38.320
Dude's saying he can't come.

00:38.461 --> 00:39.809
We're gonna wait.

00:42.097 --> 00:44.377
- What? Are you there, man?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah,

00:44.377 --> 00:46.010
- I'm still here.
- What's up?

00:46.010 --> 00:48.365
Look, you know what?
I, I found something better to do.

00:48.365 --> 00:49.904
I'm, I'll call you back later.

00:55.803 --> 00:58.801
No. No, no, no. Come on,
don't leave me now. Come...

01:01.130 --> 01:04.013
So unfair.

01:23.981 --> 01:27.750
Teenager spotted him a few
blocks away with a telescope.

01:27.750 --> 01:29.723
Do we know who our victim is?

01:29.842 --> 01:32.390
Dr. Carlos garza.

01:32.822 --> 01:35.060
None of the neighbors
knew his specialty,

01:35.060 --> 01:38.799
though they did say gorgeous
women were in and out of the place.

01:38.799 --> 01:42.577
Mm, gorgeous women,
and one of them smoked.

01:45.451 --> 01:47.801
Suicides are filled with shame.

01:47.801 --> 01:50.424
They commit the act in closets,

01:50.424 --> 01:52.948
empty hotel rooms...

01:54.207 --> 01:56.504
with the curtains drawn.

01:57.047 --> 01:58.834
This one's out in the open.

01:58.834 --> 02:01.076
Framed in picture glass.

02:01.076 --> 02:03.915
I think somebody put
Dr. Garza on display.

02:03.915 --> 02:05.858
And that somebody...

02:06.946 --> 02:09.074
just got our attention.

02:44.220 --> 02:47.452
MIAMI
2x11 Complications

03:14.752 --> 03:17.117
Six inches above
the noose, please.

03:17.117 --> 03:18.547
Yes, sir.

03:19.364 --> 03:23.320
I just spoke to the Florida medical board.
Our victim, Carlos garza,

03:23.320 --> 03:24.917
anesthesiologist.

03:24.917 --> 03:26.748
Does it say where he practiced?

03:26.748 --> 03:28.446
Winters beauty clinic.

03:28.446 --> 03:29.801
Plastic surgery.

03:29.801 --> 03:31.209
That explains the beautiful women.

03:31.209 --> 03:32.661
Do we have a list of their clients?

03:32.661 --> 03:34.269
It's being faxed to your office.

03:34.269 --> 03:36.167
Okay, good.
Let's be thorough on this.

03:36.167 --> 03:38.314
If this is what it looks
like a staged suicide.

03:38.314 --> 03:40.731
that means it's a murder
and a cover-up.

03:40.731 --> 03:42.674
You got it.

03:53.057 --> 03:54.800
That's snug.

03:55.805 --> 03:57.949
That's too tight for a do-it-yourselfer.

03:57.949 --> 04:01.432
Suiciders usually leave the knot loose,
let gravity do the work.

04:01.432 --> 04:03.469
And the rope's not weathered.

04:03.469 --> 04:05.965
It's too clean, it hasn't been outside.

04:08.841 --> 04:11.468
But I think I might know
where it came from.

04:11.925 --> 04:13.735
That would means the killer
was familiar with the place,

04:13.735 --> 04:15.511
knew it would be handy.

04:15.511 --> 04:17.557
Could be a weapon of opportunity.

04:28.354 --> 04:30.367
Got signs of a break-in.

04:30.367 --> 04:32.795
Looks like the intruder
kicked the door in.

04:32.909 --> 04:35.100
Left us some shoe leather.

04:37.842 --> 04:39.992
Yeah, definitely an unwanted visitor.

04:39.992 --> 04:43.544
Yeah, there's more trace down there.
Some sticky stuff.

04:44.891 --> 04:46.907
The killer might have tracked it in.
I'll, uh,

04:46.907 --> 04:48.798
see if it got anywhere else.

04:53.624 --> 04:55.496
Alexx. / Horatio.

04:56.340 --> 04:59.125
Do we have a cause of death yet?

04:59.234 --> 05:01.510
Congested face, petechiae.

05:01.510 --> 05:03.883
Cause is definitely asphyxiation,

05:03.883 --> 05:06.851
but the mode is definitely not suicide.

05:07.024 --> 05:08.536
Dual ligature marks.

05:08.536 --> 05:10.121
One set typical of hanging,

05:10.121 --> 05:13.402
the other is on a horizontal
plane against the larynx.

05:13.402 --> 05:15.789
But can you get both
from just the hanging?

05:15.789 --> 05:18.971
He was strangled, then dangled.

05:19.189 --> 05:21.265
Okay, what about
skin cells on the rope?

05:21.265 --> 05:22.681
Eric's into it.

05:22.781 --> 05:25.380
Did find scattered fibers in his hair,

05:25.380 --> 05:29.084
on his limbs, his clothes.
Sent samples to trace.

05:29.472 --> 05:30.793
And this...

05:30.793 --> 05:32.215
Silicone gel.

05:32.215 --> 05:34.518
Found a small amount on his thigh.

05:38.106 --> 05:41.282
Is it possible that he was
taking his work home with him?

05:41.282 --> 05:42.196
Well,

05:42.196 --> 05:46.683
the gel is used topically to prevent
scarring after liposuction, but...

05:46.683 --> 05:49.992
this guy isn't exactly
a candidate for that procedure.

05:49.992 --> 05:51.481
Okay, but hang on,

05:51.481 --> 05:53.404
maybe one of his patients was.

05:53.404 --> 05:57.809
Roxanne price was scheduled
for a liposuction two days ago.

06:02.689 --> 06:04.766
You may want to sit down, miss Price.

06:04.766 --> 06:09.162
Standing promotes circulation
after liposuction, doesn't it?

06:09.624 --> 06:11.692
How, how did you know?

06:15.829 --> 06:17.923
Oh, my god. Carlos.

06:17.923 --> 06:20.643
We found him hanging from the
loft in his apartment.

06:20.643 --> 06:23.104
The second photo shows some gel..

06:23.217 --> 06:24.919
on his thigh.

06:25.295 --> 06:30.451
Dr. Garza was the anesthesiologist during
your procedure two days ago, wasn't he?

06:30.451 --> 06:33.124
He's there for all my work.

06:33.269 --> 06:35.301
Can you explain the gel?

06:37.432 --> 06:39.331
It must've rubbed off.

06:42.911 --> 06:44.129
During sex.

06:44.129 --> 06:45.848
You were with him this morning?

06:45.848 --> 06:47.378
Last night. I...

06:47.378 --> 06:49.630
reapplied the gel when I woke up,

06:49.630 --> 06:52.279
and he was ready to go again.

06:52.386 --> 06:54.320
He's good to his patients, isn't he?

06:54.320 --> 06:57.116
Poor guy's had it tough
the last couple of days.

06:57.495 --> 06:59.322
It was the least I could do.

06:59.322 --> 07:01.111
How do you mean, "tough" exactly?

07:01.111 --> 07:04.498
He had a patient die on him last week.

07:06.256 --> 07:08.706
I just can't believe he'd kill himself.

07:08.706 --> 07:10.560
Neither can we.

07:15.369 --> 07:17.654
Matches your color lipstick.

07:19.023 --> 07:21.279
Is that your brand?

07:22.874 --> 07:24.947
Yeah.

07:24.947 --> 07:27.322
What... what does that have
to do with anything?

07:27.322 --> 07:29.082
Well, we're not exactly sure yet,

07:29.082 --> 07:32.478
but here's what I want you to do.
Leave your cell phone on, okay?

08:13.729 --> 08:15.077
Are you tied up?

08:16.019 --> 08:17.451
Cute.

08:17.451 --> 08:18.803
Did somebody beat me to it?

08:18.803 --> 08:20.769
How about the entire day shift.

08:22.411 --> 08:24.287
So what's the rope made out of?

08:24.287 --> 08:26.026
Twisted seagrass.

08:26.144 --> 08:27.783
Any epithelials?

08:27.783 --> 08:29.421
I'm, uh, I'm going
to swab the rope now

08:29.421 --> 08:31.774
where we think he was strangled,
check for DNA.

08:31.774 --> 08:34.549
That makes good sense.
The hands of the killer...

08:37.655 --> 08:38.539
and what about the knots?

08:38.539 --> 08:41.534
Are they specific to any sort of
particular occupation?

08:41.534 --> 08:44.440
Occupation, pastime.
They're nautical.

08:44.440 --> 08:45.811
They're called bowline knots.

08:45.811 --> 08:47.827
They're, uh, used for tying
off boats and stuff.

08:47.827 --> 08:49.489
I see them a lot when
I'm out on the water.

08:49.489 --> 08:51.423
I was hoping that you
were going to say that.

08:51.423 --> 08:55.130
Why is that? / Horatio just found out
that our vic had a patient

08:55.130 --> 08:57.072
who died on the
table a week ago.

08:57.072 --> 08:59.675
Sara foster.
She's survived by a husband,

08:59.675 --> 09:01.575
and guess where he works?

09:11.250 --> 09:12.370
Excuse me, Mr. Foster,

09:12.370 --> 09:14.814
Do you mind if we ask you
a couple of questions?

09:14.944 --> 09:17.216
I'm working. Can this wait?

09:17.391 --> 09:19.582
Well, not really. We, uh,

09:19.582 --> 09:22.037
we need to know
if you recognize this man here.

09:24.426 --> 09:25.812
Too bad.

09:25.925 --> 09:27.983
You don't seem to be
too broken up about it.

09:27.983 --> 09:29.891
Well, it's not going
to bring my wife back.

09:30.012 --> 09:32.684
Well, we realize that, Mr. Foster,
but you have to understand,

09:32.684 --> 09:35.171
it's our job to find out
who murdered Dr. Garza.

09:35.171 --> 09:37.054
It's not an easy task, is it?

09:37.183 --> 09:40.432
finding somebody who's going to
take responsibility for their actions?

09:40.985 --> 09:42.735
So why come to me?

09:42.863 --> 09:43.968
'Cause you have motive.

09:43.968 --> 09:46.027
'Cause my wife went in
to Dr. Winters beauty clinic

09:46.027 --> 09:48.006
for a routing operation
and didn't come out?

09:48.006 --> 09:50.926
And so you blame Dr. Garza,
the anesthesiologist?

09:50.926 --> 09:52.247
Not just him.

09:52.313 --> 09:53.185
the whole clinic.

09:53.185 --> 09:55.650
How long have you been
working here, Mr. Foster?

09:56.164 --> 09:57.520
A little over a year.

09:57.520 --> 09:58.837
Why?

09:58.837 --> 10:01.659
Well, I notice you tie a nice knot.

10:02.194 --> 10:03.760
So?

10:04.726 --> 10:06.985
- Look at his shoes.
- I'm good at my job.

10:13.907 --> 10:16.085
We're going to need
you to come in with us.

10:25.071 --> 10:28.703
Based on the scuffs that we
found on Dr. Garza's front door,

10:28.703 --> 10:31.279
we know you were at his condo...

10:31.482 --> 10:33.700
And now we want to know why.

10:38.846 --> 10:41.127
Sara got silicone implants...

10:41.127 --> 10:43.385
for our wedding five years ago.

10:44.423 --> 10:46.928
I told her I loved her
just the way she was, but

10:46.928 --> 10:48.677
she wanted them anyway.

10:50.738 --> 10:52.295
Her friend swears that
the new ones are better,

10:52.295 --> 10:54.124
so she decided to trade up.

10:54.124 --> 10:56.038
At the winters beauty clinic.

10:56.038 --> 10:57.921
She was in there two hours.

10:57.921 --> 11:00.486
Winters comes out and
tells me she's gone.

11:00.952 --> 11:04.115
Gone, just like that,
after routine surgery.

11:06.154 --> 11:08.990
They killed my wife, and they
didn't even come to her funeral.

11:10.731 --> 11:13.471
- So you went to talk to Winters?
- Tried.

11:13.471 --> 11:16.250
He's on fisher island.
Place has a moat...

11:16.578 --> 11:18.228
so I went to Garza.

11:19.115 --> 11:21.657
Don't try to ignore me!
I can hear you in there!

11:25.890 --> 11:27.475
And you know what I saw?

11:27.625 --> 11:29.538
A scared little man...

11:29.816 --> 11:31.948
without the nurses and
the stethoscope, just saying,

11:31.948 --> 11:34.672
"please, don't hurt me,
don't hurt me. "

11:34.941 --> 11:36.404
I left.

11:36.404 --> 11:37.593
Didn't even touch him.

11:37.593 --> 11:40.195
Well, if you want to eliminate
yourself as a suspect,

11:40.328 --> 11:42.639
I would suggest you
give us a DNA sample.

11:42.730 --> 11:45.206
If you promise me you'll find
out exactly how they killed my wife.

11:45.206 --> 11:48.406
There is no evidence of foul
play in your wife's autopsy.

11:48.406 --> 11:49.360
Autopsy?

11:49.360 --> 11:50.828
By another doctor?

11:51.719 --> 11:54.441
They cover for each other.
Don't you get it?

11:56.036 --> 11:59.309
How about if I could get our M.E.

11:59.416 --> 12:01.945
to take another look?
How would that be?

12:06.969 --> 12:09.752
I've reviewed the paperwork
on Sara foster's autopsy.

12:09.752 --> 12:10.844
Cause of death?

12:10.844 --> 12:13.277
Cardiac arrest brought on
by hemorrhagic shock.

12:13.277 --> 12:15.579
Should we be investigating this, Alexx?

12:15.786 --> 12:19.063
Well, the M.E. who did
the post didn't think so.

12:19.063 --> 12:20.588
What do you think?

12:20.796 --> 12:23.180
The M.E. Is a good man, Horatio,

12:23.314 --> 12:24.733
but I think he might
have missed something.

12:24.733 --> 12:26.493
So did Sara's husband.

12:26.493 --> 12:29.335
Report gives us the cause
but not the reason.

12:29.335 --> 12:33.214
We don't know why Sara foster
went into hemorrhagic shock.

12:37.478 --> 12:39.567
What about surgical error?

12:39.567 --> 12:41.016
Can't rule it out.

12:41.016 --> 12:45.309
There's also the issue of what action
the clinic took once she went into shock.

12:50.757 --> 12:53.362
Protocol for arrhythmia is
to hang a bag of epinephrine,

12:53.362 --> 12:55.236
introduce it via an IV.

12:59.631 --> 13:02.863
Now, for some reason, they
ignored the IV already in her hand,

13:02.863 --> 13:05.071
injecting it straight into her heart.

13:07.217 --> 13:09.369
Medical misadventure for sure.

13:09.369 --> 13:12.151
Misadventure? Are we
talking about homicide?

13:12.151 --> 13:15.674
Well, I need to look at the body
myself before I can say that.

13:15.674 --> 13:18.136
Okay, so we need to exhume Sara.

13:18.340 --> 13:19.797
Well...

13:19.797 --> 13:21.686
That's going to take a court order,

13:21.686 --> 13:24.707
and no judge is going to give you one
of those without corroborating evidence.

13:24.707 --> 13:27.262
Well, we better find some.

13:40.316 --> 13:43.030
I have no idea
who would hurt Dr. Garza.

13:43.030 --> 13:45.900
Dr. Winters, I am
actually more interested

13:45.900 --> 13:48.793
in who caused Sara foster's death.

13:48.914 --> 13:52.359
Well, there was an autopsy,
and the clinic wasn't at fault.

13:52.800 --> 13:56.658
What about Carlos garza?
Is he to blame for Sara's arrhythmia?

13:58.949 --> 14:00.577
I'd rather not speak ill of the dead.

14:00.577 --> 14:03.656
Then why don't you speak
on behalf of your clinic?

14:03.792 --> 14:06.812
Carlos was a licensed
anesthesiologist.

14:06.812 --> 14:08.067
He was highly regarded.

14:08.067 --> 14:11.701
I guess what I'm asking you
is do you think was he at fault?

14:11.817 --> 14:14.168
You've never made
a mistake, lieutenant?

14:14.968 --> 14:17.262
Not one I was forced to bury.

14:18.497 --> 14:22.160
Okay. We keep a computerized
log of every procedure.

14:22.160 --> 14:24.592
Now, after Sara's death,

14:24.592 --> 14:27.034
Carlos suggested
that we...

14:27.034 --> 14:28.718
erase the record,

14:28.718 --> 14:29.704
and I refused.

14:29.704 --> 14:31.651
Unfortunately, doctor-patient
confidentiality prevents me from

14:31.651 --> 14:34.517
showing you anything
without a warrant.

14:34.665 --> 14:36.001
Oh, here you go.

14:36.001 --> 14:38.365
Be careful. The ink's still wet.

14:45.122 --> 14:46.581
Debbie...

14:48.945 --> 14:51.934
Yes, doctor? / Could you pull up
Sara poster's case records, please?

14:51.934 --> 14:55.587
And also the EKG data
collected during the operation.

14:56.686 --> 14:58.200
Everything.

14:58.200 --> 15:00.774
Yes, sir. / Thank you.

15:01.264 --> 15:02.529
Oh, you have nice, uh,

15:02.529 --> 15:04.301
nice bone structure.

15:05.277 --> 15:06.955
Perfect symmetry.

15:06.955 --> 15:09.103
And it didn't cost me a penny.

15:16.003 --> 15:19.123
Those fibers we found
all over the guy's body

15:19.123 --> 15:20.925
were the same length.

15:21.069 --> 15:23.547
Same length, same source.

15:23.802 --> 15:25.088
What kind are they?

15:25.088 --> 15:26.423
Wool.

15:26.423 --> 15:28.910
Had an asymmetrical loop pattern.

15:28.910 --> 15:31.367
It's the kind they use
to make persian rugs.

15:36.595 --> 15:38.185
Speed...

15:39.198 --> 15:41.966
imagine you're a doctor,
and you got this hot crib.

15:41.966 --> 15:43.232
Lot of ladies coming by,

15:43.232 --> 15:45.385
and then you go ahead and you
put these grandma rugs in here?

15:45.385 --> 15:46.655
What are you thinking?

15:46.655 --> 15:47.816
Well...

15:48.037 --> 15:51.307
just because you have a degree in
medicine doesn't mean you have taste.

15:51.307 --> 15:55.111
Besides, from the sounds of it, the
guy was doing pretty okay for himself.

15:55.111 --> 15:57.585
I mean, he could've done
a little better, you know?

15:57.585 --> 16:02.073
A little shag, bearskin, something
like that. You know what I mean?

16:04.808 --> 16:06.142
Here we go.

16:11.230 --> 16:13.105
Dr. Carlos garza?

16:13.437 --> 16:15.151
He doesn't live here anymore.

16:15.260 --> 16:17.367
- Where does he live?
- He doesn't.

16:17.473 --> 16:19.816
- You got some for him?
- And you'd be...?

16:22.094 --> 16:24.742
I'm on the job.
He was murdered here yesterday.

16:24.860 --> 16:26.659
Guess that explains the tape.

16:26.928 --> 16:28.708
I was attempting to serve him.

16:28.708 --> 16:30.029
Civil suit.

16:30.029 --> 16:31.707
Came around yesterday,
but he wasn't here.

16:31.707 --> 16:33.006
Really? What time?

16:33.006 --> 16:34.182
5:00.

16:34.182 --> 16:36.550
I knocked,
but there was no answer.

16:36.701 --> 16:38.080
He was going to be
deposed tomorrow.

16:38.080 --> 16:39.443
Who's bringing the civil suit?

16:39.443 --> 16:41.176
A Brad foster.

16:41.364 --> 16:43.058
Wrongful death of spouse.

16:47.251 --> 16:50.017
Sara foster's medical history.

16:50.017 --> 16:52.199
Implants five years ago.

16:52.199 --> 16:54.282
Ovarian cysts removed, Benign.

16:54.282 --> 16:56.716
And then, of course, the failed
implant switch last week.

16:56.716 --> 16:59.480
Let's pull up the data collected
during the surgery.

17:01.064 --> 17:02.423
Okay...

17:02.922 --> 17:04.602
Blood pressure, heart rate,

17:04.602 --> 17:06.194
pulse oximetry

17:06.194 --> 17:08.580
all stable up to this point.

17:09.650 --> 17:12.407
Whoa, I can't translate it.
That's got to be bad.

17:12.407 --> 17:14.425
Onset of arrhythmia.

17:19.570 --> 17:22.567
Any second now we'll
see the epinephrine hit.

17:24.919 --> 17:26.647
It doesn't hit.

17:26.781 --> 17:28.530
Can you fast forward?

17:31.288 --> 17:34.628
Far enough. / There's the
spike in the EKG right there.

17:34.628 --> 17:38.795
Monitor puts the first indication
of a problem at 11:03,

17:39.239 --> 17:43.087
but the epinephrine didn't reach
the heart till 11:08.

17:43.087 --> 17:45.975
Five minutes, and
nobody did anything?

17:45.975 --> 17:48.081
That's a long time.

17:50.210 --> 17:52.734
Looks like we got our exhumation.

18:32.016 --> 18:34.113
I was expecting worse.

18:34.274 --> 18:36.306
Embalming helps the family,

18:36.306 --> 18:38.180
but it doesn't help me.

18:38.424 --> 18:42.632
Eyelids and lips are glued together,
and that's just for starters.

18:42.632 --> 18:46.409
So sorry, sweetie.
No one deserves to be here twice.

18:46.791 --> 18:48.121
Did you find anything?

18:48.121 --> 18:49.536
Oh, yeah.

18:49.671 --> 18:51.815
Body's always the best witness.

18:51.979 --> 18:54.130
Found traces of silicone.

18:55.111 --> 18:56.936
So the implant was leaking.

18:56.936 --> 18:58.761
Into her chest cavity.

18:58.761 --> 19:02.217
They had to scrape out every last drop.

19:04.516 --> 19:05.826
Cleaning led to an oozing,

19:05.826 --> 19:07.892
and that kind of bleeding can
get away from you.

19:07.892 --> 19:11.115
That's why she went
into hemorrhagic shock.

19:13.746 --> 19:15.542
And that's when the arrhythmia began.

19:15.542 --> 19:18.543
All they had to do was add
epinephrine to the IV in her hand.

19:18.543 --> 19:20.372
- But why didn't they do that?
- They did,

19:20.372 --> 19:22.838
but the IV was infiltrated,
missed the vein.

19:22.838 --> 19:25.600
The epinephrine flooded
the surrounding tissues...

19:25.600 --> 19:28.436
No one noticed what was taking effect.

19:28.958 --> 19:31.763
It choked vein in her hand.

19:31.909 --> 19:34.396
Leading to complete
capillary constriction,

19:34.396 --> 19:36.458
never making it
anywhere near her heart.

19:36.458 --> 19:38.662
So that's when they went to plan B.

19:38.774 --> 19:41.273
IV doesn't work, you go direct.

19:41.273 --> 19:43.470
Uma thurman, pulp fiction.

19:43.722 --> 19:46.593
Epinephrine injection
straight to the heart.

19:46.593 --> 19:50.021
Heart goes from zero to a
hundred in less than a second.

19:51.198 --> 19:53.168
Which the heart fought.

19:56.509 --> 19:58.478
and lost.

19:59.443 --> 20:00.911
Alexx, let me ask you something.

20:00.911 --> 20:03.418
Who's normally responsible
for the placement of the IV?

20:03.418 --> 20:05.262
Is it the surgeon? / No.

20:05.262 --> 20:07.609
It's the surgical nurse.

20:08.884 --> 20:10.090
Tried to save her life,

20:10.090 --> 20:11.702
and you're accusing
me of killing her?

20:11.702 --> 20:13.525
Well, your intent was to save Sara,

20:13.525 --> 20:16.713
but yes, your actions ended
up resulting in her death.

20:16.713 --> 20:19.172
The IV slipped out.
The shot didn't work.

20:19.172 --> 20:21.462
Well, I wasn't the one
who nicked her implant, okay?

20:21.462 --> 20:23.608
That's what started this whole thing.

20:23.608 --> 20:26.493
Are you saying that
Dr. Winters did this?

20:28.467 --> 20:31.054
Look, we all work as a team.

20:31.054 --> 20:34.012
There could be eight hands
on a body at any one time.

20:35.032 --> 20:37.454
But only one holds the scalpel.

20:39.564 --> 20:41.844
It's called complications.

20:41.975 --> 20:45.653
There are risks in any medical
procedure, and I tell all my patients that.

20:45.653 --> 20:47.365
Well, it wasn't just Garza

20:47.365 --> 20:49.387
who was named in the civil action.

20:49.502 --> 20:51.106
Talk about complications.

20:51.106 --> 20:55.230
Sara's husband is suing everybody
down at the clinic, including you.

20:55.905 --> 20:59.204
Were you concerned about what
Garza might say in his deposition?

20:59.204 --> 21:01.128
We're doctors. We get sued all the time.

21:01.128 --> 21:03.366
- It's the way of the world.
- So you didn't go to Garza's condo

21:03.366 --> 21:06.882
- and motivate him to toe the party line?
- No, I didn't leave the clinic all afternoon.

21:06.882 --> 21:10.019
I was with a patient. / Okay.
We'll need the name of that person.

21:10.019 --> 21:13.003
- Fine. Go check the books.
- We will do that, Keith.

21:13.136 --> 21:15.922
That's "doctor," lieutenant.

21:15.922 --> 21:18.546
Maybe not for long.

21:20.697 --> 21:23.515
Ms. Price, we believe that Dr. Winters

21:23.515 --> 21:26.587
was involved in the
murder of Carlos garza.

21:27.713 --> 21:29.261
Dr. Winters?

21:29.261 --> 21:30.934
That's correct.

21:30.934 --> 21:33.709
Dr. Winters. And...

21:33.709 --> 21:36.143
Dr. Winters says

21:36.143 --> 21:39.368
that he was with you while
it happened. Now, is that true?

21:39.368 --> 21:42.472
Well, I did have an appointment
with him yesterday about 3:00.

21:42.472 --> 21:44.127
Just you and Winters?

21:44.127 --> 21:46.458
- For about hour, hour and a half.
- Hour and a half.

21:46.458 --> 21:48.407
That's quite a long follow-up.

21:48.407 --> 21:50.700
It wasn't a follow-up.

21:50.900 --> 21:52.480
I was in for, uh,

21:52.480 --> 21:55.078
botox forehead and eyes.

21:55.138 --> 21:57.545
So soon after surgery?

21:58.274 --> 22:01.540
I guess I'm a bit of an addict.

22:01.671 --> 22:03.857
Just want to be the perfect woman.

22:05.948 --> 22:08.118
Or the perfect alibi.

22:11.874 --> 22:13.552
You shouldn't be frowning.

22:13.552 --> 22:14.857
Why? What's... what do you mean?

22:14.857 --> 22:17.942
Well, if you just recently
received botox injections,

22:17.942 --> 22:21.176
the muscles in your face
should still be paralyzed,

22:21.176 --> 22:23.007
shouldn't they?

22:23.143 --> 22:26.432
Would you like to change
your story now, Ms. Price?

22:30.937 --> 22:33.585
I'll take that as a no.

22:44.313 --> 22:45.928
Hey, you got my results?

22:45.928 --> 22:47.466
They're processed.

22:47.743 --> 22:51.185
Should be spitting out of
the printer any sec.

22:51.185 --> 22:52.677
Cool.

22:53.530 --> 22:55.173
Valera, you ever wonder why, uh,

22:55.173 --> 22:57.347
people are so scared of getting old?

22:57.504 --> 22:58.860
What do you mean?

22:58.860 --> 23:02.406
Plastic surgery clinics
on every corner.

23:02.406 --> 23:05.185
People spending every dime they have
to look like something they're not.

23:05.185 --> 23:07.370
Well, to each his own.

23:07.370 --> 23:08.875
Me,

23:08.875 --> 23:11.176
I'd rather upgrade my computer.

23:12.448 --> 23:14.354
The thing is, though, you got
to know when to stop,

23:14.354 --> 23:17.468
you know what I mean? I remember
Speed had this girlfriend a while back and

23:17.468 --> 23:20.719
she looked like she stood
in a wind tunnel. / What?

23:20.719 --> 23:21.974
Yeah, a face like...

23:21.974 --> 23:24.449
oh, yeah, like a perpetual
state of surprise.

23:24.449 --> 23:25.768
Yeah, exactly.

23:31.586 --> 23:33.658
Here's the results on the hair.

23:33.658 --> 23:35.404
What about the murder weapon?

23:35.509 --> 23:37.459
What murder weapon?

23:37.459 --> 23:39.304
The epithelials on the rope I gave you.

23:39.304 --> 23:40.858
I never got those swabs.

23:40.858 --> 23:43.364
What are you talking about?
I booked it four hours ago.

23:43.364 --> 23:45.490
Well, you may have ordered them up,

23:45.490 --> 23:47.417
but they were never delivered.

23:48.517 --> 23:51.295
But I have some good news.

23:51.295 --> 23:54.335
The hair in the victim's belt
matches the husband.

23:54.335 --> 23:55.857
So, he was there.

23:55.857 --> 23:56.917
Yeah.

23:56.917 --> 24:01.457
Look, we found an ancillary hair probably
from an arm, lodged in Dr. Garza's belt,

24:01.457 --> 24:03.380
and, uh...

24:03.380 --> 24:05.009
it's yours.

24:08.273 --> 24:09.752
I didn't kill him.

24:09.752 --> 24:12.329
Then how do you explain
your hair on the victim?

24:12.834 --> 24:14.850
I was there after he died.

24:14.850 --> 24:17.607
This morning, you said
you were there before he died.

24:17.607 --> 24:20.235
Now you're saying after. Which is it?

24:23.176 --> 24:25.459
He was already dead when I got there.

24:25.459 --> 24:28.583
My gut reaction was to try to
help him, so I tried to get him down.

24:32.784 --> 24:34.306
But he was dead weight.

24:34.306 --> 24:36.121
Why didn't you try to
untie him from the railing?

24:36.121 --> 24:37.613
I was about to...

24:37.613 --> 24:40.206
then someone came to the door,
scared the hell out of me.

24:49.510 --> 24:51.206
it was some guy in a suit.

24:51.206 --> 24:53.649
- He looked official.
- Why didn't you let him in?

24:53.649 --> 24:55.473
Well, I didn't think
it would look too good.

24:55.473 --> 24:59.266
Well, Brad, I have to tell you,
it doesn't look so good right now.

25:05.883 --> 25:07.349
What?

25:07.471 --> 25:10.742
I scanned them through the computer.
They're supposed to be in box 54.

25:10.742 --> 25:12.380
They aren't there, Paula.

25:12.380 --> 25:13.646
Okay, what do you want me to do?

25:13.646 --> 25:16.054
I want you to do a box-to-box
search until you find them, okay?

25:16.054 --> 25:17.868
Those epithelials are from the rope..

25:17.868 --> 25:19.417
our murder weapon.
If those get lost...

25:19.417 --> 25:21.589
I'll find them, I promise.

25:21.589 --> 25:24.225
Look, nothing's been compromised.
Everything is secure.

25:24.225 --> 25:25.763
All right. Good.
Can you double-time it for me?

25:25.763 --> 25:27.152
I'm on it.

26:27.788 --> 26:29.288
Hey, Glenn.

26:29.414 --> 26:30.660
I need to talk to you.

26:30.660 --> 26:32.431
I'm a little busy at the moment.

26:32.431 --> 26:34.078
Tanking someone else's career?

26:34.078 --> 26:36.559
What? / Sara foster's case.

26:36.559 --> 26:38.307
Horatio caine.

26:38.426 --> 26:40.947
How could you question my protocol
without even talking to me?

26:40.947 --> 26:41.941
Hey,

26:41.941 --> 26:44.575
CSI asks for an opinion, I give it.

26:44.575 --> 26:48.049
And for your information, I covered
your ass on that autopsy.

26:48.049 --> 26:51.858
Yeah, right. /32-year-old girl dies
and you sign off on cardiac arrest?

26:51.858 --> 26:53.467
Please.

26:55.328 --> 26:56.549
Three posts a day.

26:56.549 --> 26:59.753
- I'd like to see you work my case load.
- Well, maybe that's your problem, Glenn.

26:59.753 --> 27:04.328
What is? / Less volume and
more quality time on each post,

27:04.328 --> 27:08.581
and we wouldn't need a backhoe to
figure out what happened to this girl.

27:08.581 --> 27:11.266
I got two ex-wives and three kids.

27:11.266 --> 27:14.267
How do you suggest I make those
monthly payments on a straight salary?

27:14.267 --> 27:16.944
Well, I suggest, Glenn,

27:16.944 --> 27:20.041
you worry less about alimony
and more about the victim.

27:20.041 --> 27:21.238
But, hey,

27:21.238 --> 27:23.266
that's just me.

27:37.123 --> 27:38.674
Hey,

27:38.674 --> 27:42.129
remember that sticky stuff
we found all over the condo?

27:42.313 --> 27:43.374
Take a look at it.

27:43.374 --> 27:44.894
Was it sap?

27:45.016 --> 27:46.541
Close.

27:47.282 --> 27:48.734
It's honeydew.

27:48.879 --> 27:53.170
It's what sap becomes when it's
ingested and excreted by aphids.

28:01.579 --> 28:04.253
Could these aphids be found
on brazilian pepper trees?

28:04.253 --> 28:06.649
Yeah, but they're not indigenous to miami.

28:06.649 --> 28:09.316
Only high-end landscapers bring them in.

28:09.316 --> 28:11.845
Including the one at Dr. Winters' clinic.

28:16.286 --> 28:19.030
That's a nice car.
You must have to wash it all the time.

28:19.030 --> 28:21.064
Oh, I got people for that.

28:21.295 --> 28:23.149
What can I do for you?

28:23.149 --> 28:26.394
Well, you see this sap all around.
it's called honeydew.

28:27.685 --> 28:29.036
Really?

28:29.863 --> 28:31.062
Thanks for the nature lesson.

28:31.062 --> 28:33.070
Well, it's very specific
to this kind of tree,

28:33.070 --> 28:36.577
and this is the only place
that it hangs over.

28:37.129 --> 28:38.687
You know what?

28:39.111 --> 28:40.708
I like the shade.

28:40.708 --> 28:43.979
The interesting thing is, we found
this stuff all over Dr. Garza's apartment,

28:43.979 --> 28:46.782
which puts you at his place.

28:46.782 --> 28:48.374
I have an alibi,

28:48.374 --> 28:49.355
remember?

28:49.355 --> 28:53.252
I do, Dr. Winters, and Horatio caine
is talking to her right now.

28:53.252 --> 28:54.855
Good.

28:55.232 --> 28:57.005
I don't have anything to hide.

28:57.005 --> 28:59.607
Then you won't mind
giving me a DNA sample.

29:05.872 --> 29:08.707
Dr. Winters' billing records
for your account.

29:08.707 --> 29:10.068
A generous man.

29:10.068 --> 29:12.185
Your last three procedures
were taken off.

29:12.185 --> 29:13.361
So, that was the deal.

29:13.361 --> 29:18.407
You were his alibi in exchange
for free plastic surgery, right?

29:21.123 --> 29:25.264
More like a little white lie
in exchange for eternal youth.

29:25.400 --> 29:29.264
- Eternal youth?
- He promised me unlimited visits.

29:29.264 --> 29:31.037
You know what that's worth?

29:31.037 --> 29:34.777
Cosmetic procedures are elective.
Insurance doesn't cover any of it.

29:34.777 --> 29:36.586
So, you slept with one doctor,

29:36.586 --> 29:39.330
and you faked an alibi
to protect another.

29:39.330 --> 29:43.385
You have to understand.
Those doctors made me what I am.

29:43.385 --> 29:46.551
Well, I can assure you of one thing.
Whatever that bill says,

29:46.551 --> 29:48.926
you're still going to pay the price.

29:50.068 --> 29:51.751
Got a minute?

29:58.336 --> 30:01.148
- Do you want me to pick up Dr. Winters?
- No, I would hold off.

30:01.148 --> 30:03.687
Why? We just blew his alibi wide open.

30:03.687 --> 30:06.704
You give somebody enough rope,
they might hang themselves.

30:20.731 --> 30:21.838
Eric,

30:21.838 --> 30:23.800
took some doing,
but I found your evidence.

30:23.800 --> 30:25.634
Oh, that's great.
Where was it?

30:25.634 --> 30:27.395
Envelope got stuck to another bag.

30:27.395 --> 30:29.418
In transmittal. Drug bust
from night shift.

30:29.418 --> 30:30.669
Cool. Was my stuff compromised?

30:30.669 --> 30:31.883
Nope.

30:33.217 --> 30:34.592
Skin cells?

30:34.707 --> 30:35.968
From the rope.

31:00.781 --> 31:01.948
Speed,

31:01.948 --> 31:04.145
the fibers from Garza's body?

31:04.145 --> 31:06.472
Looking at the rug
in question right now.

31:06.961 --> 31:08.632
Okay.

31:09.423 --> 31:10.850
Is this the one?

31:10.850 --> 31:13.592
Yeah, this rug was
upstairs in the loft.

31:13.592 --> 31:16.614
Killer strangled him, he fell on it
before he got tossed over.

31:16.614 --> 31:18.786
Where were the fibers located?

31:18.786 --> 31:20.054
In his hair,

31:20.054 --> 31:21.525
all over his clothing,

31:21.525 --> 31:24.139
- front and back.
- What does that tell you?

31:24.586 --> 31:26.210
It tells me that, uh,

31:26.210 --> 31:28.631
he fell pretty hard on the rug.

31:30.782 --> 31:32.569
Or not at all.

31:32.569 --> 31:33.925
Maybe...

31:33.925 --> 31:36.624
maybe he was rolled onto it.

31:39.394 --> 31:42.939
So someone took Garza
for a ride to the railing.

31:43.081 --> 31:45.161
Why not just carry him?

31:45.161 --> 31:46.878
Occupational habit.

31:49.574 --> 31:50.781
H?

31:50.781 --> 31:52.335
Yes, sir.

31:52.784 --> 31:55.071
Finally got the results from
the epithelials on the rope.

31:55.071 --> 31:56.442
And?

31:56.550 --> 31:59.986
Well, no, uh, hits in
any database, so no id,

31:59.986 --> 32:01.996
but we did get one thing.

32:02.142 --> 32:03.824
Amelogenin?

32:03.824 --> 32:05.552
X, X.

32:06.091 --> 32:07.666
That...

32:07.666 --> 32:09.936
that certainly narrows the field.

32:16.937 --> 32:19.953
Could we have a moment
of your time, please?

32:24.285 --> 32:26.157
I've got a patient waiting.

32:26.357 --> 32:28.690
A real patient, or

32:28.690 --> 32:31.287
one to fake as an alibi?

32:31.902 --> 32:33.909
Roxanne told us.

32:39.643 --> 32:41.903
Okay, look, uh,

32:42.066 --> 32:44.570
I went to Carlos' place
the day he died.

32:44.696 --> 32:46.522
So did Debbie.

32:47.910 --> 32:49.705
Didn't you, Debbie?

32:49.935 --> 32:51.755
Well, we were all being sued.

32:51.755 --> 32:53.412
We didn't want him to cave.

32:53.677 --> 32:56.313
Carlos, come on,
get with the program.

32:57.285 --> 33:00.004
We have insurance for a reason.

33:00.472 --> 33:02.240
I'm sick of hiding behind it.

33:02.240 --> 33:03.713
I'm going to tell the truth.

33:03.713 --> 33:05.691
No, all you're going to do
is take us down.

33:05.691 --> 33:06.875
Maybe we deserve it.

33:06.875 --> 33:08.544
Complications?

33:08.544 --> 33:10.303
This was more than that.

33:10.303 --> 33:12.212
You'll bring the clinic down.

33:14.587 --> 33:15.877
Let's go, Debbie.

33:15.877 --> 33:17.424
It's getting us nowhere.

33:24.296 --> 33:25.742
We didn't kill anyone.

33:25.742 --> 33:29.128
So, you don't know what happened
after you left, do you?

33:29.128 --> 33:31.074
No, but I'm sure you're going to tell us.

33:31.074 --> 33:32.888
Debbie went back.

33:36.933 --> 33:38.684
Can't you leave well enough alone?

33:40.188 --> 33:41.622
What?

33:41.738 --> 33:43.088
No, that's completely...

33:43.088 --> 33:45.892
We managed to recover some
skin cells on the murder rope,

33:45.892 --> 33:49.285
and they have female DNA.
Now, we are here to take samples

33:49.285 --> 33:51.800
from the other employees
here at the clinic,

33:51.800 --> 33:54.221
but what I'd rather do, Debbie,

33:54.331 --> 33:56.227
is start with you.

33:56.312 --> 33:58.146
How would that be?

34:00.792 --> 34:02.225
Things aren't well,

34:02.225 --> 34:03.953
Are they, Carlos?

34:04.051 --> 34:05.512
Don't be so dramatic.

34:05.512 --> 34:07.716
Now leave, you bitch.

34:20.841 --> 34:23.201
You knew you had to dress it up,

34:23.821 --> 34:27.592
make it look like his conscience
truly got the best of him.

34:27.592 --> 34:30.402
And with your nurse's training,
you were able to move the bodies

34:30.402 --> 34:33.257
from surface to surface, effortlessly.

34:33.257 --> 34:35.059
Right, Debbie?

34:39.639 --> 34:41.536
Slid him across the floor,

34:41.536 --> 34:43.531
fashioned a noose.

34:46.121 --> 34:49.101
And tossed him over.

34:52.059 --> 34:56.105
Then walked away from your
second dead body in a week.

34:58.928 --> 35:00.450
Well,

35:00.450 --> 35:02.602
you're wrong about why.

35:04.039 --> 35:07.898
He told me that he would
stop sleeping with our patients.

35:08.031 --> 35:09.931
Promised.

35:11.337 --> 35:13.937
I saw the cigarette.

35:17.017 --> 35:19.287
You'll bring the clinic down.

35:21.346 --> 35:23.078
Let's go, Debbie.

35:25.936 --> 35:28.145
You and Carlos?

35:29.229 --> 35:31.468
If you weren't such
a self-obsessed M.D.,

35:31.468 --> 35:33.320
You would be able to see
that there was a relationship

35:33.320 --> 35:35.184
going on right under your nose.

35:35.184 --> 35:37.353
How long did it go on?

35:38.522 --> 35:40.275
A year.

35:43.872 --> 35:47.694
I got left behind with the
sutures and the cleanup.

35:47.694 --> 35:50.409
Carlos would go home with the

35:50.409 --> 35:53.622
girls that I helped make beautiful.

35:55.672 --> 35:57.560
No.

35:57.996 --> 35:59.209
Debbie,

35:59.209 --> 36:01.039
you are about to find out

36:01.039 --> 36:04.518
that there are far worse things

36:04.518 --> 36:06.958
than getting left behind.

36:14.607 --> 36:15.637
Alexx?

36:15.637 --> 36:16.754
Hey.

36:16.754 --> 36:19.009
We got the nurse for
Dr. Garza's murder.

36:19.009 --> 36:20.601
That's great.

36:20.741 --> 36:22.752
But it's got nothing to
do with Sara foster.

36:22.752 --> 36:24.263
Are you still working on the case?

36:24.263 --> 36:28.008
Waded through a week's worth
of biohazard waste from the clinic.

36:28.427 --> 36:31.079
- Found this.
- Is that Sara's implant?

36:31.079 --> 36:34.289
Matched the serial number
to her medical records.

36:34.289 --> 36:37.373
Nurse claimed Dr. Winters
nicked it during surgery.

36:37.373 --> 36:39.258
Well, we all know how reliable she is.

36:39.258 --> 36:40.809
Exactly.

36:40.986 --> 36:42.736
I think this one's ruptured.

36:42.736 --> 36:45.979
If the scalpel had cut it,
it wouldn't have been this jagged.

36:45.979 --> 36:48.109
What kind of force are you talking about?

36:48.218 --> 36:51.168
I got an exact match
of Sara foster's implant,

36:51.168 --> 36:56.157
and that's what this servo-hydraulic
fatigue tester's going to tell us.

36:56.157 --> 36:57.872
We have this in our budget?

36:59.014 --> 37:01.044
Called in a favor.
Kent brought it in.

37:01.044 --> 37:03.619
Taking the steps monroe wouldn't.

37:03.681 --> 37:08.200
This baby tests everything
from jet metal to artificial veins.

37:10.634 --> 37:15.064
The compression platens measure
the psi up to its burst pressure.

37:26.432 --> 37:28.106
It just broke.

37:29.769 --> 37:33.268
At 240 psi.
That's from trauma.

37:34.300 --> 37:37.163
Horatio is going to love this.

38:10.673 --> 38:12.250
Brad.

38:13.541 --> 38:14.987
Tell me you got good news.

38:14.987 --> 38:16.995
Tell me you arrested Winters.

38:20.075 --> 38:22.270
I think you should drop your civil suit.

38:22.270 --> 38:24.069
Are you kidding me?

38:25.887 --> 38:27.897
I knew you guys would close ranks.

38:27.897 --> 38:31.053
Is that what this is? You just got some system
designed to protect each other, don't you?

38:31.053 --> 38:33.107
Has your wife ever been
in a car accident?

38:33.107 --> 38:34.523
What?

38:34.523 --> 38:35.813
No.

38:35.970 --> 38:37.724
Okay. Did you ever hit her?

38:37.724 --> 38:39.607
Never.

38:40.045 --> 38:41.002
Here's why I asked.

38:41.002 --> 38:44.986
The M.E. Said that your wife's implant
was ruptured by an exertion of pressure

38:44.986 --> 38:49.123
that exceeded 240 pounds
per square inch.

38:49.939 --> 38:52.367
You mean before the surgery?

38:53.991 --> 38:55.510
I...

38:58.447 --> 38:59.702
Oh, no.

39:00.696 --> 39:02.292
Talk to me, Brad.

39:04.897 --> 39:08.659
I was always trying to get Sara
to go sailing with me.

39:09.680 --> 39:12.317
And she always said no.

39:12.770 --> 39:15.749
She was so scared of the water.

39:16.212 --> 39:18.388
And I kept pushing it.

39:20.871 --> 39:22.833
Coming about.

39:28.789 --> 39:30.497
Sara?

39:30.914 --> 39:32.776
Baby, are you okay?
I'm so sorry.

39:32.776 --> 39:34.954
That's okay. I'm, I'm fine.

39:35.364 --> 39:36.910
it's fine.

39:37.745 --> 39:40.049
She wasn't fine, was she?

39:40.197 --> 39:43.326
The M.E. calls it a precipitating event.

39:45.165 --> 39:47.244
I'm as guilty as they are.

39:47.244 --> 39:49.488
It was your accident, their oversight,

39:49.488 --> 39:51.942
and neither requires an arrest.

39:54.501 --> 39:57.207
I kept asking you to find the truth,

39:57.207 --> 39:59.367
but I never thought that...

40:03.290 --> 40:05.155
Brad,

40:05.155 --> 40:06.917
listen to me.

40:07.111 --> 40:09.708
That's why they call it an accident.

40:41.075 --> 40:43.127
Alexx.

40:44.570 --> 40:48.963
I did some thinking about what you said,
me tripling up on shifts, and...

40:49.157 --> 40:50.521
You did, huh?

40:50.521 --> 40:54.804
Yeah. You made me realize maybe I
stretched myself a little too thin.

40:57.571 --> 40:59.551
You doing anything tonight?

41:00.642 --> 41:02.345
Why?

41:03.375 --> 41:06.372
The brass thinks you should
relieve some of my burden.

41:07.545 --> 41:08.797
Your burden?

41:08.797 --> 41:12.758
Well, you call it overtime,
the brass calls it a burden.

41:12.758 --> 41:15.163
After you got done
talking to them, right?

41:15.163 --> 41:16.331
Whatever.

41:16.331 --> 41:18.403
Point is stabbing victim.

41:18.403 --> 41:20.469
60-odd puncture wounds. / What?

41:20.469 --> 41:23.212
- All yours.
- That's at least a seven-hour post.

41:23.212 --> 41:26.630
Aim for six.
P.D. wants a COD. by sun-up.

41:26.630 --> 41:30.546
Don't do anything I
wouldn't do, all right?
