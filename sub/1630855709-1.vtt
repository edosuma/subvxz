10:51.984 --> 10:54.253
Which organization?
Susan G. Komen, Mediviver,

10:54.253 --> 10:55.921
-Breastfeet Forward?
-Breastfeet Forward.

10:55.921 --> 10:59.025
What? No way! Me too!
Look! Look!

10:59.025 --> 11:02.595
-Yeah, that's the one.
-Oh, I love breast cancer!

11:02.595 --> 11:04.663
I'm doing the prostate.
All good causes!

11:04.663 --> 11:06.132
-Yes!
-Yeah!

11:06.132 --> 11:09.468
Hell yeah! Oh!

11:09.468 --> 11:13.839
Pat, you gotta come on our next
team run. They are so fun.

11:13.839 --> 11:16.375
-Nah, I'm good.
-Oh, you gotta go!

11:16.375 --> 11:18.310
You gotta.

11:18.310 --> 11:21.947
-Yeah. I gotta go.
-Sick. Tomorrow morning.

11:21.947 --> 11:26.085

Gotta beat the heat.

-Hey.

11:54.547 --> 11:56.048
Hi.

11:56.048 --> 11:59.251
Wow, nice outfit.
Very fluorescent.

11:59.251 --> 12:02.088
Thank you.

12:03.756 --> 12:05.991
You'll get there.
Okay, come on.

12:05.991 --> 12:07.359
Let's go meet the
rest of the team.

12:07.359 --> 12:09.061
Okay.

12:09.061 --> 12:12.465
Whoa!
She really loves running.

12:15.868 --> 12:18.370
Hey, Kiki.
This is Pat.

12:18.370 --> 12:21.907
Oh, my gosh. New friend?
It's so nice to meet you, Pat.

12:21.907 --> 12:24.710
You're serving me
gym class chic right now.

12:24.710 --> 12:28.581
Oh, thanks. I was starting to
feel like maybe I dressed wrong.

12:28.581 --> 12:30.616
-Hey!
-Whoa. Hey.

12:30.616 --> 12:31.951
Harry Hays, man,
good to meet you.

12:31.951 --> 12:33.052
Yeah, you too.

12:33.052 --> 12:35.855
Yeah. Welcome.
Whoa.

12:35.855 --> 12:38.090
-What is happening?
-So they are a couple.

12:38.090 --> 12:39.658
It's best to just
give them a little space.

12:39.658 --> 12:41.994
Anyway, I wanted to ask you,
how did you get into this great

12:41.994 --> 12:43.696
-sport of running, huh?
-Oh, you know--

12:43.696 --> 12:47.032
Oh! Running is a sport together.
Really.

12:47.032 --> 12:49.635
Running is for children and
people who can't hold their pee.

12:49.635 --> 12:51.170
You want a real sport?

12:51.170 --> 12:53.506
Try race walking.
That's a real sport right there.

12:53.506 --> 12:55.307
Heel, toe. Heel, toe, heel, toe.

12:55.307 --> 12:56.709
Your feet never
leave the ground.

12:56.709 --> 12:58.444
That's a real thrill!
All right, baby?

12:58.444 --> 13:03.115
Save it, Harry. No one cares
about your fake sport.

13:03.115 --> 13:05.618
Why should I learn
how to run slow?

13:05.618 --> 13:10.222
I already know how to run slow.
I want to learn how to run fast.

13:10.222 --> 13:13.292
Don is gonna be leading a blind
runner through the marathon.

13:13.292 --> 13:16.162
The proper nomenclature is
differently abled.

13:16.162 --> 13:18.197
Actually, I think blind is okay.
Or visually impaired.

13:18.197 --> 13:21.967
How would you know?
You sighted son of a bitch.

13:21.967 --> 13:23.636
-[laughs]
-I think it's just--

13:23.636 --> 13:25.771
Babe, you forget your password
again? It's all fives.

13:25.771 --> 13:28.607
No, I know my password. It's
just this Breastfeet Forward app

13:28.607 --> 13:31.043
is driving me crazy. My sister's
been trying to make a donation

13:31.043 --> 13:33.045
for the last hour.
And it keeps crashing on her.

13:33.045 --> 13:35.981
You know what? Maybe it's time
to unleash your Aardvark.

13:35.981 --> 13:37.249
What the fuck did
you say to me?

13:37.249 --> 13:39.151
-No. Sorry.
-You wanna see my dick?

13:39.151 --> 13:40.619
What? No, I don't know.
It's Aardvark.

13:40.619 --> 13:42.521
It's the money transfer app
I work for. I could set up

13:42.521 --> 13:46.058
an account for our donations,
and since it earns interest,

13:46.058 --> 13:48.227
it's just a way to put all
our fundraising on autopilot.

13:48.227 --> 13:51.163
And that's a whole lot of--
It's more money.

13:51.163 --> 13:53.032
-[Harry] Dick?
-No, it's just more money.

13:53.032 --> 13:55.267
Well, I love using
tech to get an edge.

13:55.267 --> 13:57.570
Pat, I proudly appoint
you treasurer

13:57.570 --> 14:01.340
of Team Breastfeet Forward.
Okay, let's get a move on.

14:01.340 --> 14:03.175
-More responsibility.
-See you in a minute.

14:03.175 --> 14:05.477
-Congrats.
-Thank you.

14:06.679 --> 14:09.014
[Harry] <i>Baby, this dude tried</i>
to see my aardvark.

14:09.014 --> 14:12.084
Hey, hold up. Hold, hold.
Let's move.

14:12.084 --> 14:14.620
-Coming through, meatball.
-Oh. Ouch.

14:16.855 --> 14:19.325
[turns on music]
Shit.

14:20.626 --> 14:25.097
And away we go.

14:26.665 --> 14:28.100
[groans]

14:32.771 --> 14:34.640
[Man] Where am I?

14:35.708 --> 14:38.110
We're in the hospital.
You hit me with your car.

14:38.110 --> 14:40.446
And then you fainted.

14:40.446 --> 14:41.814
Ah.

14:41.814 --> 14:43.949
-Hello, Mr. Cassidy?
-Yeah, right here.

14:43.949 --> 14:47.419
I'm Mr. Cassidy.

14:47.419 --> 14:49.221
Uh, you...

14:51.724 --> 14:54.193
He probably has a concussion
or he's senile. We'll see.

14:54.193 --> 14:56.462
-Anyway, hi, Pat.
-Hi.

14:56.462 --> 14:59.064
-Hey, Rita.
-Hi, Julie. Sorry, Dr. Hall.

14:59.064 --> 15:00.000
We missed you on the
run this morning.

15:00.000 --> 15:00.566
We missed you on the
run this morning.

15:00.566 --> 15:03.035
-Julie's on our team, too.
-It's true. I was bummed when

15:03.035 --> 15:04.503
I had to cover this shift,

15:04.503 --> 15:06.939
but now I feel
like I didn't miss much.

15:06.939 --> 15:11.010
Glad I could help.
Am I dying?

15:12.478 --> 15:13.512
Yes.

15:13.512 --> 15:15.948
Wait. Really?

15:15.948 --> 15:17.850
-No, you're fine.
-[laughing]

15:17.850 --> 15:20.486
No, you're fine.
You're fine.

15:20.486 --> 15:21.720
She got you so good!

15:21.720 --> 15:24.623
Your testosterone is low.
Abdominal fat is high.

15:24.623 --> 15:26.091
Why'd they test for that?

15:26.091 --> 15:28.060
But no broken bones or internal
bleeding, so you can go.

15:28.060 --> 15:29.395
-Great.
-Well, no, I'm sorry.

15:29.395 --> 15:31.430
I got hit by a car.
It hurts.

15:31.430 --> 15:34.266
Oh, I bet it hurts.
Cars are made of metal.

15:34.266 --> 15:36.068
-Right.
-Maybe next time you're running,

15:36.068 --> 15:38.103
try listening to your headphones
at a moderate level.

15:38.103 --> 15:39.838
-That's a real rookie move.
-Yeah.

15:39.838 --> 15:43.442
Oh, God. So it's my fault?
Um, well, okay. I'm sorry.

15:43.442 --> 15:45.978
Could I just--
Could I get some drugs maybe?

15:45.978 --> 15:47.613
Oh, I've got just the thing.

15:47.613 --> 15:51.417
We're going to go with one
pair of real running shoes.

15:51.417 --> 15:53.919
-That's not what I meant.
-Multiple athletic shirts.

15:53.919 --> 15:55.154
That's not pills.

15:55.154 --> 15:57.856
-And modern shorts.
-You're confused.

15:57.856 --> 16:00.192
See you two at
the next team run.

16:00.192 --> 16:03.962
Okay.
I'll just leave with nothing.

16:06.165 --> 16:10.369
Dude, running sucks.
I ran one time. It sucked.

16:10.369 --> 16:13.138
Yeah, you're not wrong.
At least it's for a good cause.

16:13.138 --> 16:16.675
-What's the cause?
-Keeping my job.

16:16.675 --> 16:18.043
I meant what cancer?

16:18.043 --> 16:19.611
Isn't there only
one kind of cancer?

16:19.611 --> 16:22.214
And it just shows up in
different parts of your body?

16:22.214 --> 16:24.483
That sounds entirely wrong.
I'm not a scientist,

16:24.483 --> 16:27.353
but I'm sure the scientists
are just sharing notes.

16:27.353 --> 16:29.388
Yeah, like peer reviews
and shit, and it's all on one

16:29.388 --> 16:32.157
big health database.
I mean, it's gotta be illegal

16:32.157 --> 16:33.559
to not share cancer notes,
right?

16:33.559 --> 16:34.993
Mm-hmm.
And if they don't share it,

16:34.993 --> 16:36.395
they violating the hippo laws.

16:36.395 --> 16:37.496
Exactly.

16:37.496 --> 16:39.098
So this is all just
to impress a client?

16:39.098 --> 16:43.268
Yep. And I gotta practice
almost every morning.

16:43.268 --> 16:45.371
-It's nice knowing you.
-What are you talking about?

16:45.371 --> 16:46.905
You still down for
<i>Tokyo Drift</i> in the morning?

16:46.905 --> 16:50.309
Shit! Stop it. You know
I don't even like running, man.

16:50.309 --> 16:51.777
I'm just doing it
to win this stupid account,

16:51.777 --> 16:53.746
and get Spencer off my ass.
And then we'll be right back

16:53.746 --> 16:57.850
to breakfast burritos
and B-movie matinees.

16:57.850 --> 17:01.053
-B movies?
-Oh, no, I--

17:01.053 --> 17:03.589
Look, I didn't mean it
like that, man.

17:03.589 --> 17:08.827
Patrick, have you been watching
<i>Fast and Furious</i> ironically?

17:08.827 --> 17:13.132
No, man. I mean, like, I think
they're good, but not like...

17:13.132 --> 17:15.067
good-good.

17:16.735 --> 17:19.571
I don't even know
who you are anymore, dawg.

17:20.939 --> 17:22.608
I think you should
probably leave.

17:22.608 --> 17:24.309
Dave, come on, man.

17:24.309 --> 17:26.278
I don't have friends.

17:26.278 --> 17:30.382
Right now, I don't either.

17:31.884 --> 17:34.920

-Yay! And eat pizza bagels?

<i>Yeah, I know.</i>

17:41.260 --> 17:42.795
I wish I never joined
this stupid running team

17:42.795 --> 17:45.130
-in the first place.
-Totally.

17:45.130 --> 17:47.199
Maybe I should just
quit the team, quit my job

17:47.199 --> 17:51.870
-and do what I love.
-Hmm. I know.

17:51.870 --> 17:54.239
Like, you know,
doing bath salts

17:54.239 --> 17:56.308
just to see what all
the fuss is about.

17:56.308 --> 17:58.177
Follow your bliss.

17:58.177 --> 17:59.411
-Pat.
-Huh?

17:59.411 --> 18:00.746
I'm trying to sort
some stuff out here.

18:00.746 --> 18:02.114
And I feel like you're being
completely distant.

18:02.114 --> 18:03.315
I mean, come on.
I need your help.

18:03.315 --> 18:04.683
What should I do?

18:04.683 --> 18:06.685
Well, I mean, it's not
like you have any hobbies

18:06.685 --> 18:09.621
or anything you're
really interested in,

18:09.621 --> 18:14.426
so I guess I'm just wondering,
like, what would you do?

18:14.426 --> 18:17.229
I have hobbies.
I drive.

18:17.229 --> 18:18.730
-That's not a hobby.
-What does that even mean?

18:18.730 --> 18:20.265
We're adults.
What are your hobbies?

18:20.265 --> 18:23.368
Book club, yoga,
trading crypto.

18:23.368 --> 18:25.137
When did you join a book club?

18:25.137 --> 18:28.240
No one reads <i>Infinite Jest</i>
for fun, Pat.

18:28.240 --> 18:29.441
Pat, why am I being yelled at?

18:29.441 --> 18:30.943

I get pitched all week,

42:06.741 --> 42:09.744
You wanna carbo load.
That means pizza, pasta, bagels.

42:09.744 --> 42:11.479
You want your gluten
as high as possible.

42:11.479 --> 42:13.348
The more gluten, the better.

42:13.348 --> 42:15.483
As far as smoking,
in moderation.

42:15.483 --> 42:18.386
I recommend some dip
to protect the lungs.

42:18.386 --> 42:20.989
Hang on, Harry.
I'm on the phone.

42:20.989 --> 42:24.525
Pat, is everything okay?
Did you get hit by another car?

42:24.525 --> 42:26.127
What? No. Everything's fine.

42:26.127 --> 42:28.096
I just wanted to see if you
would coach me for the marathon.

42:28.096 --> 42:32.100
Whatever, sure. Next time, text.
No one calls. Ever.

42:32.100 --> 42:34.168
Got it. So how's work?

42:34.168 --> 42:36.371
[Julie] <i>Wow, hemorrhaging.</i>
Nurse, get me a clamp.

42:36.371 --> 42:37.405

42:37.405 --> 42:39.507
Ooh! Not good.

42:39.507 --> 42:42.276
[music]

42:42.276 --> 42:45.213
-So let's talk goals.
-Yeah.

42:45.213 --> 42:47.682
-Do you have one?
-Yes, I think a good goal for me

42:47.682 --> 42:50.618
would be to run a two
and a half hour marathon.

42:50.618 --> 42:52.887
Nice. What's your actual goal?

42:52.887 --> 42:55.523
Why not? I mean, that's just
under a six-minute pace.

42:55.523 --> 42:57.058
You're nowhere near that.

42:57.058 --> 42:58.726
Well, when we started, I was
averaging 10-minute miles,

42:58.726 --> 43:00.762
and after a month, I'm running
eight-minute miles.

43:00.762 --> 43:02.663
So, you know, with the
marathon two months away,

43:02.663 --> 43:04.599
I figured I'd knock off another
two minutes at least.

43:04.599 --> 43:08.002
Okay. By your math,
in three months,

43:08.002 --> 43:10.972
you'd be the marathon
world record holder.

43:10.972 --> 43:13.207
I do seem to take to it
naturally. Yeah, I guess.

43:13.207 --> 43:16.244
See, that's not how this works.
The difference between averaging

43:16.244 --> 43:19.047
six minutes and averaging eight
minutes is like the difference

43:19.047 --> 43:22.000
between being Gordon Ramsay
and being Chef Boyardee.

43:22.000 --> 43:22.216
between being Gordon Ramsay
and being Chef Boyardee.

43:22.216 --> 43:24.752
-I like Chef Boyardee.
-Of course you do.

43:24.752 --> 43:27.288
Let's aim for
an eight-minute pace.

43:27.288 --> 43:28.890
That's a three-thirty marathon.

43:28.890 --> 43:31.526
If you ran a three-thirty
marathon, it'd be the most

43:31.526 --> 43:35.663
impressive thing you've done in
your life by a lot, like, ever.

43:35.663 --> 43:38.099
Like, so, so much--

43:38.099 --> 43:39.767
What are you doing?

43:39.767 --> 43:42.937
Uh, whoa. I'm stopping
'cause we ran the first hill.

43:42.937 --> 43:45.039
No, we're not
doing hill repeats.

43:45.039 --> 43:49.010
We just started on a hill.
You're screwed. Come on.

43:49.010 --> 43:52.380

Let's just say I wouldn't want
to be breast cancer right now.

Come on, man.

53:10.003 --> 53:12.105
Sorry, Timothy.

53:20.598 --> 53:24.402
Thank you for that moment of
silence. Don and Julie,

53:24.402 --> 53:27.271
your mothers and their brave
fights against breast cancer

53:27.271 --> 53:29.940
remain inspirational
to all of us.

53:29.940 --> 53:32.109
And we race for them.

53:32.109 --> 53:36.647
And we race for survivors
like Kiki and myself.

53:36.647 --> 53:40.518
Shout out to our very
special guest, my oncologist,

53:40.518 --> 53:44.255
Dr. Parsons. With her help,
we will find a cure.

53:44.255 --> 53:47.958
And with the money we've raised,
we can reach that goal!

53:47.958 --> 53:51.395
So, Pat, our trusted treasurer,
how much have we raised so far?

53:51.395 --> 53:54.965
I gambled all the team's money.

53:54.965 --> 53:56.300
What?

53:56.300 --> 53:59.503
I, uh, I bet it all
against my boss that

53:59.503 --> 54:01.272
I'd beat him in the marathon.

54:01.272 --> 54:03.941
Why would you do that?
You suck at running.

54:03.941 --> 54:05.543
Wait, so all the
money is just gone?

54:05.543 --> 54:07.178
I didn't lose it yet.
I mean, there's a chance

54:07.178 --> 54:11.015
I could still get it back,
but...

54:11.015 --> 54:12.483
Yeah, it's basically gone.

54:12.483 --> 54:17.521
-You slimy motherfucker!
-Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay.

54:17.521 --> 54:21.425
Wow, man.
I thought better of you, really.

54:21.425 --> 54:24.428
The Germans have a word
for scum like you,

54:24.428 --> 54:26.764
but you're not worthy
of hearing it.

54:26.764 --> 54:29.300
[spits]

54:29.567 --> 54:32.203
[Rita] So you're clearly
kicked off the team, Pat.

54:32.203 --> 54:35.606
And this obviously
kills our business deal.

54:35.606 --> 54:38.542
Hey, look, I don't care how you
do it, but that money

54:38.542 --> 54:41.979
needs to be back in our account
by race day.

54:42.546 --> 54:47.284
Wow, you're a real
piece of shit.

54:48.552 --> 54:51.121
Uh, I...

54:51.489 --> 54:54.625
I just can't believe
you would do this. Why?

54:54.625 --> 54:57.595
It was Spencer. I mean,
he got to me and I snapped.

54:57.595 --> 55:00.531
And I wanted to get him back,
so I upped the bet.

55:00.531 --> 55:02.366
I thought I could beat him in
the race. And--

55:02.366 --> 55:04.335
But it was that morning that
you told me I could beat him

55:04.335 --> 55:05.903
and show him who's boss
in the marathon.

55:05.903 --> 55:09.340
I didn't tell you to steal from
a goddamn cancer charity, Pat.

55:09.340 --> 55:11.675
Well, I didn't--
I didn't steal anything.

55:11.675 --> 55:13.143
-You didn't steal anything?
-No, no.

55:13.143 --> 55:14.712
I didn't steal anything.
Whether I lost or not,

55:14.712 --> 55:16.647
that money was always going
towards defeating cancer.

55:16.647 --> 55:19.049
I mean, isn't there just one
type of cancer that shows up in

55:19.049 --> 55:21.051
-different parts of your body?
-No!

55:21.051 --> 55:24.989
What? Our teammates in there
worked so hard to raise that

55:24.989 --> 55:27.625
money because they had
their lives turned upside down

55:27.625 --> 55:31.262
by breast cancer,
not prostate cancer.

55:31.262 --> 55:33.531
But I'm sure all the scientists
are sharing notes.

55:33.531 --> 55:37.535
-All the scientists?
-Like on a medical database?

55:37.535 --> 55:41.238
Pat, there isn't
just one big cancer lab!

I'm not an emotional guy.

58:39.416 --> 58:45.355
I tend to put up a lot of walls

58:49.359 --> 58:52.629

58:52.629 --> 58:54.364

I never really had any real

58:54.364 --> 58:56.366

show up and put in the work,

59:03.640 --> 59:06.643
you don't stand a chance.

I wasn't showing up

01:03:14.558 --> 01:03:16.000
Oh, white breasted nuthatch,
you don't see those everyday.

01:03:16.000 --> 01:03:17.494
Oh, white breasted nuthatch,
you don't see those everyday.

01:03:17.494 --> 01:03:19.062
Oh, oh, oh!

01:03:19.062 --> 01:03:21.031
I'm sorry.
I didn't see you there.

01:03:21.031 --> 01:03:22.833
I can't see!

01:03:22.833 --> 01:03:26.403
Oh, oh!
Are you with the guide dogs?

01:03:26.403 --> 01:03:29.806
Yes, yes! Are you the
differently abled person

01:03:29.806 --> 01:03:32.142
-I'll be running with today?
-Yes.

01:03:32.142 --> 01:03:36.246
I have a tether that we can
hold on to during the race.

01:03:36.246 --> 01:03:37.647
Perfect!

01:03:37.647 --> 01:03:39.449
[laughter]

01:03:39.449 --> 01:03:40.884
[cheering]

01:03:40.884 --> 01:03:43.954
It's time to twalk, baby.
All y'all gonna walk.

01:03:43.954 --> 01:03:46.289
Have to talk and walk.

01:03:46.289 --> 01:03:51.595
Don't mind my smoke
coming from my hips.

01:03:51.595 --> 01:03:52.596
Let's go!

01:03:52.596 --> 01:03:53.764
[cheering]

01:03:55.132 --> 01:03:56.734
It's hammer time, baby!
It's time to move!

01:03:56.734 --> 01:03:59.937
[cheering]

01:04:00.905 --> 01:04:03.974
And there go the race walkers
in the Sweet Peach Marathon.

01:04:03.974 --> 01:04:06.076
I'm Tabitha Fox
and joining me today

01:04:06.076 --> 01:04:08.445
are Olympian
and distance running icon

01:04:08.445 --> 01:04:09.713
Jeff Galloway

01:04:09.713 --> 01:04:12.483
and legendary running back
Reggie Bush.

01:04:12.483 --> 01:04:14.251
Great to be here, Tabitha.

01:04:14.251 --> 01:04:17.454
Thanks for having me,
but I'm a football player.

01:04:17.454 --> 01:04:19.690
I've never ran more than
a hundred yards at a time.

01:04:19.690 --> 01:04:21.959
I think there's been a mistake.

01:04:21.959 --> 01:04:23.627
Yeah, well, we need you
for the ratings.

01:04:23.627 --> 01:04:25.429
Now, Jeff, tell us,

01:04:25.429 --> 01:04:27.364
what are these competitors
thinking right now?

01:04:27.364 --> 01:04:30.968
It's important to pace yourself
and not go out too hard.

01:04:30.968 --> 01:04:34.238
How can they go out too hard?
They're walking.

01:04:34.238 --> 01:04:36.173
[Tabitha] <i>Well, the prize money</i>
for the first-place race walker

01:04:36.173 --> 01:04:39.476
is $50,000.
No laughing at that.

01:04:39.476 --> 01:04:41.979
$50,000?

01:04:41.979 --> 01:04:44.248
That's more than you're paying
me for this.

01:04:44.248 --> 01:04:45.449
I'll be right back.

01:04:47.718 --> 01:04:49.987
Reggie, Reggie, Reggie,
Reggie, Reggie?

01:04:49.987 --> 01:04:53.557
Um, well, there goes
Reggie Bush,

01:04:53.557 --> 01:04:56.760
but I think Mr. Bush, who
was a football player, mind you,

01:04:56.760 --> 01:04:57.928
is gonna have a little trouble

01:04:57.928 --> 01:05:01.198
catching up to
these race walkers.

01:05:01.198 --> 01:05:04.268
<i>Wow, looks like somebody's got</i>
his Heisman back.

01:05:04.268 --> 01:05:06.937
Well, the runners are up in
just one hour,

01:05:06.937 --> 01:05:09.306
so stick around with us
for all your race coverage.

01:05:11.141 --> 01:05:15.346
[shouting]

01:05:15.346 --> 01:05:16.814
-Hey, Rita.
-Yeah.

01:05:16.814 --> 01:05:19.183
Are you sure you wanna
carry all that for 26 miles?

01:05:19.183 --> 01:05:22.052
Oh, absolutely. Going for a PR.
Feeling confident.

01:05:22.052 --> 01:05:24.154
Okay.

01:05:27.257 --> 01:05:29.193
Nite, nite.

01:05:30.794 --> 01:05:33.731
[cheering]

01:05:33.731 --> 01:05:36.700
[Man] <i>Racers, on your mark.</i>

01:05:36.700 --> 01:05:37.768
You got this.

01:05:37.768 --> 01:05:40.638
[Man] <i>Get set.</i>

01:05:40.638 --> 01:05:41.872
<i>Go!</i>

01:05:41.872 --> 01:05:44.074
[cheering]

01:05:44.074 --> 01:05:49.413
[music]

01:05:55.285 --> 01:05:59.356
And they're off. The Sweet Peach
Marathon is officially underway.

01:06:01.191 --> 01:06:03.127
-Grab a cup.
-I got the belt.

01:06:03.127 --> 01:06:05.396
No, save that for when
you're in no man's land.

01:06:05.763 --> 01:06:08.232
-Here.
-Got it.

01:06:14.838 --> 01:06:17.641
Hey, hey, relax.
We're on pace.

01:06:18.008 --> 01:06:19.977
It's not a sprint.
It's literally a marathon.

01:06:19.977 --> 01:06:21.879
That's why we have the phrase.

01:06:21.879 --> 01:06:24.882
Soon, Spencer. Soon.

01:06:27.051 --> 01:06:29.787
You're doing amazing, Don.
I can hardly keep up.

01:06:29.787 --> 01:06:32.623
Swiftly, Kirk.
Pothole!

01:06:32.623 --> 01:06:35.893
Don, how did you do that? I--
Thou art a magnificent creature.

01:06:35.893 --> 01:06:37.594
Oh, I blush.

01:06:37.594 --> 01:06:40.230
[laughing]

01:06:46.403 --> 01:06:48.338
Are you a man or a mouse?

01:06:48.338 --> 01:06:50.441
Come on! Man or mouse?
Man or mouse? Man or mouse?

01:06:50.441 --> 01:06:52.543
Man or mouse?
Man or mouse? Man or mouse?

01:06:52.543 --> 01:06:53.811
Man or mouse? Man or mouse?

01:06:53.811 --> 01:06:57.114
Well, Spencer's lost it.
His veins are too veiny.

01:06:57.114 --> 01:06:59.183
And you know I'm a vein girl.

01:06:59.183 --> 01:07:02.152
Oh, my God, here comes Pat!
Go, Pat!

01:07:02.152 --> 01:07:06.090
Okay, we did it.
Let's go brunch.

01:07:06.090 --> 01:07:07.791
Tabitha, this is amazing.

01:07:07.791 --> 01:07:09.626
Look how they're
trading off the lead.

01:07:09.626 --> 01:07:11.795
Uh-huh, yeah, great.
We're actually gonna cut away

01:07:11.795 --> 01:07:14.865
from the leaders right now
and check in with Nancy Ryan,

01:07:14.865 --> 01:07:16.533
who's at the back
of the pack with a runner

01:07:16.533 --> 01:07:19.369
in pretty wacky attire.

01:07:19.369 --> 01:07:21.872
-Get a load of this.
-Let's see this bullshit.

01:07:21.872 --> 01:07:23.474
Jeff, we can still hear you.

01:07:23.474 --> 01:07:25.509
Take it away, Nancy.

01:07:25.509 --> 01:07:28.078
Thanks, Tabitha. I'm here at
mile five with a runner

01:07:28.078 --> 01:07:30.214
that's got the crowd
going cuckoo.

01:07:30.214 --> 01:07:31.782
How are you feeling,
Chicken Man?

01:07:31.782 --> 01:07:34.284
Like a million clucks, Nance.

01:07:34.284 --> 01:07:36.253
Honestly, I'm just happy
the fans stuck around

01:07:36.253 --> 01:07:39.423
for us slowpokes
because I don't run at all.

01:07:39.423 --> 01:07:40.724
Wow.

01:07:40.724 --> 01:07:42.326
Yeah, I'm just here because
I lost my fantasy league.

01:07:42.326 --> 01:07:45.028
-What's up, Chicken Man?
-Hello. Boom! Chicken Man!

01:07:45.028 --> 01:07:46.730
Gotta love the people.

01:07:46.730 --> 01:07:48.499
This is eggcellent.

01:07:48.499 --> 01:07:49.767
Agreed.

01:07:49.767 --> 01:07:51.769
That must've been refreshing.

01:07:51.769 --> 01:07:55.172
Are you worried about becoming a
fried chicken in that suit?

01:07:55.172 --> 01:07:57.875
I mean, we're going
so slow that it's--

01:07:57.875 --> 01:08:00.144
Shut the fuck up, Chicken Man!

01:08:00.144 --> 01:08:04.314
I will pluck every fucking
feather from your fucking body!

01:08:04.314 --> 01:08:06.583
Why don't we lose this
fowl mouth, huh?

01:08:06.583 --> 01:08:10.621
That's good. I'm Nancy Ryan.
Back to you.

01:08:10.921 --> 01:08:13.857
I don't understand.
I don't understand.

01:08:13.857 --> 01:08:16.427
I don't understand.

01:08:23.767 --> 01:08:26.336
Ma'am, are you okay?

01:08:26.336 --> 01:08:28.605
No. [crying]

01:08:31.108 --> 01:08:33.110
But I will be.

01:08:43.320 --> 01:08:44.354
Asshole!

01:08:44.354 --> 01:08:46.523
Well, if I'm an asshole,
you're shit.

01:08:46.523 --> 01:08:49.359
I pushed you out of me
like soft serve ice cream.

01:08:49.359 --> 01:08:52.563
-Oh, I really hate him.
-[Spencer hisses]

01:08:52.563 --> 01:08:54.000
-How are you feeling?
-I'm feeling good.

01:08:54.000 --> 01:08:55.299
-How are you feeling?
-I'm feeling good.

01:08:55.299 --> 01:08:57.501
Okay, look.
You can finish this.

01:08:57.501 --> 01:08:59.203
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Are you leaving me?

01:08:59.203 --> 01:09:01.839
Yes, but only because I wanna
run much faster than this.

01:09:01.839 --> 01:09:05.609
So follow me up to Spencer,
run with him, stay relaxed.

01:09:05.609 --> 01:09:07.444
And try not to shit yourself
when you hit the wall.

01:09:07.444 --> 01:09:09.646
How very inspiring,
but is hitting the wall

01:09:09.646 --> 01:09:11.582
like a runner's high where
it's nowhere near as intense

01:09:11.582 --> 01:09:13.150
-as is sounds?
-No.

01:09:13.150 --> 01:09:15.853
Hitting the wall actually feels
like hitting a wall.

01:09:15.853 --> 01:09:18.355
When it happens, remember there
are paramedics nearby

01:09:18.355 --> 01:09:21.258
-and you won't die, probably.
-Wait, what? Really? Seriously?

01:09:21.258 --> 01:09:24.127
And here we are.
You got this.

01:09:24.494 --> 01:09:27.264
Oh, what is going
on with your body?

01:09:27.264 --> 01:09:29.132
-Stop it.
-Stop what?

01:09:29.132 --> 01:09:31.101
-Stop hitting my arm.
-It's not illegal.

01:09:31.101 --> 01:09:32.836
Where'd he go?

01:09:32.836 --> 01:09:34.771
Race official.
Race official.

01:09:34.771 --> 01:09:36.640
-What are you gonna do?
-He's hitting me. Stop it.

01:09:36.640 --> 01:09:39.276
Stop it. Stop it. Stop it.

01:09:39.276 --> 01:09:41.378
Well, as the lead runners
close in on the finish line,

01:09:41.378 --> 01:09:44.348
we're honored to be joined
by our first finisher,

01:09:44.348 --> 01:09:46.583
your Sweet Peach
race walking champion

01:09:46.583 --> 01:09:50.921
and new world record holder,
Reggie Bush.

01:09:50.921 --> 01:09:54.458
-Reggie, how do you feel?
-I feel fine.

01:09:54.458 --> 01:09:57.928
I was walking.
Where's that check?

01:09:57.928 --> 01:09:59.363
I want my money.

01:09:59.363 --> 01:10:02.466
Well, I agree with that.
Tabitha, get him his money.

01:10:04.134 --> 01:10:07.471
Hey. This is it.

01:10:07.471 --> 01:10:09.139
Oh, this is what
people are waiting for.

01:10:09.139 --> 01:10:10.474
The main event.

01:10:10.474 --> 01:10:13.243
[Woman]
You got this, Aunt Janet!

01:10:13.243 --> 01:10:17.080
This is where you meet the wall.
20 miles down,

01:10:17.080 --> 01:10:20.684
6.2 long miles to go.
How are you holding up?

01:10:20.684 --> 01:10:22.152
I'm good.

01:10:22.152 --> 01:10:23.553
Ooh, that's not what you're
body's saying.

01:10:23.553 --> 01:10:27.624
I can see the salt building up
on your rims, Patarita.

01:10:27.624 --> 01:10:29.893
Jesus.

01:10:29.893 --> 01:10:31.328
Mm, I didn't know you were
kosher.

01:10:31.328 --> 01:10:34.197
Oh, keep that head up,
Tupat Shakur.

01:10:34.197 --> 01:10:37.601
Look around you, brother!

01:10:40.704 --> 01:10:43.907
[bell clanging]

01:10:43.907 --> 01:10:47.744
[music]

01:10:51.048 --> 01:10:53.450
[gun shots]

01:11:04.661 --> 01:11:08.465
It hurts like fire!

01:11:10.200 --> 01:11:13.036
How you feelin', General Patton?

01:11:13.036 --> 01:11:14.571
-I'm fine.
-Oh, good.

01:11:14.571 --> 01:11:17.240
Then this surge should be
no problem, soldier.

01:11:17.240 --> 01:11:22.279
Move out, move out! Weapons hot!
Here we go! Move out!

01:11:22.279 --> 01:11:23.580
[breathing heavy]

01:11:26.600 --> 01:11:30.004
Hey, hun, how about a push?
[giggles]

01:11:30.004 --> 01:11:32.239
Kiki...
What? No.

01:11:32.239 --> 01:11:34.842
I'm not helping you
with whatever this is.

01:11:34.842 --> 01:11:38.279
What? My legs gave out,
but my will is strong.

01:11:38.279 --> 01:11:40.114
And so are my triceps.

01:11:40.114 --> 01:11:41.181
I'm out.

01:11:41.181 --> 01:11:42.449
I will finish!

01:11:42.449 --> 01:11:46.053
Mark my words!
Let's go.

01:11:49.123 --> 01:11:51.759
[Pat] <i>Just quit.</i>
Forget about the bet.

01:11:51.759 --> 01:11:53.193
<i>You're gonna lose anyway.</i>

01:11:53.193 --> 01:11:54.395
[Liz] <i>That's right, Pat</i> .

01:11:54.395 --> 01:11:56.997
Miracles just aren't
your skill set.

01:11:56.997 --> 01:11:58.799
We both know
you're going nowhere.

01:11:58.799 --> 01:12:00.467
[laughing]

01:12:00.467 --> 01:12:02.169
[coughing]

01:12:02.169 --> 01:12:05.272
[Pat] <i>Don't listen.</i>
Keep going.

01:12:05.272 --> 01:12:10.210
Oh, yeah, yeah!
Oh! Oh, sorry, Pat.

01:12:10.210 --> 01:12:13.614
I wanted a real man, not a boy.

01:12:13.614 --> 01:12:15.516
[inhales]

01:12:15.516 --> 01:12:18.185
-Oh, mm.
-Oh!

01:12:18.185 --> 01:12:22.623
He's the best lover
in the lower 48.

01:12:22.623 --> 01:12:24.491
No, it can't be.

01:12:24.491 --> 01:12:28.162
Come on, Pat! Live your life
a quarter mile at a time!

01:12:28.162 --> 01:12:29.263
Dave?

01:12:29.263 --> 01:12:31.332
You're almost there!
Let's go!

01:12:31.332 --> 01:12:33.067
-Dave.
-Yeah, buddy!

01:12:33.067 --> 01:12:34.368
I'm working security
for the race.

01:12:34.368 --> 01:12:36.103
Also, I didn't expect to
see you this soon, man.

01:12:36.103 --> 01:12:37.304
You're crushin' it.

01:12:37.304 --> 01:12:39.039
Here. I got you some of this
shit.

01:12:39.039 --> 01:12:40.641
-Goo!
-I guess.

01:12:40.641 --> 01:12:43.277
-Thanks, buddy. I miss you.
-Aw, don't mention it, man.

01:12:43.277 --> 01:12:45.312
You already filled up my
voicemail inbox.

01:12:45.312 --> 01:12:47.081
It really warmed my heart.

01:12:47.081 --> 01:12:49.216
Also, I am dying, okay?

01:12:49.216 --> 01:12:51.518
Your boss is right up there.
You got this!

01:12:51.518 --> 01:12:53.754
[mumbling]

01:12:53.754 --> 01:12:55.089
Save your breath, okay?

01:12:55.089 --> 01:12:57.725
Also, don't litter in front of
me, okay? I'm security.

01:12:57.725 --> 01:12:58.826
Now, go get that douche!

01:12:58.826 --> 01:13:01.428
Go get him!

01:13:01.895 --> 01:13:03.597
Uh.

Well, nearing the finish line
is former race walking

01:14:00.354 --> 01:14:02.756

01:14:02.756 --> 01:14:04.525
[Reggie] <i>The whole world</i>
does this crap?

01:14:04.525 --> 01:14:07.561
[Tabitha] <i>Yes, Reggie. Race</i>
walking is a real Olympic sport.

01:14:07.561 --> 01:14:10.297
Jeff, they're devaluing
your Olympian status.

01:14:10.297 --> 01:14:13.700
I know. I-I know.

01:14:15.769 --> 01:14:18.172
On your left! Move!

01:14:18.172 --> 01:14:20.707
Go around!
We have the right of way!

01:14:20.707 --> 01:14:23.677
Eat my ass!
I'm coming through!

01:14:23.677 --> 01:14:25.646
Whoa!

01:14:25.646 --> 01:14:27.815
No! Fuck me!

a runaway wheelchair athlete

01:14:30.317 --> 01:14:31.919

-Kiki!

01:14:49.069 --> 01:14:51.071
Run, Harry, run!

01:14:51.071 --> 01:14:53.507
I will never run!
Never!

01:14:55.309 --> 01:14:58.278
For the love of God, just run!

01:14:58.679 --> 01:15:01.648
Race walking ancestors,
give me strength!

01:15:38.585 --> 01:15:42.289
Well, marathons are hard.

Emmy-winning analysis, Tabitha.

01:15:44.458 --> 01:15:46.994
Jeff, you come into my house--

01:15:47.895 --> 01:15:51.965
Heel, toe, heel, toe,
heel, toe, heel, toe.

01:15:55.602 --> 01:15:57.604
I didn't run.
I didn't run.

01:15:57.604 --> 01:16:00.040
I know.
I know.

01:16:01.408 --> 01:16:03.410
-Hold on, baby.
-Hold on, Kiki.

01:16:03.944 --> 01:16:06.346
[growling]

01:16:06.880 --> 01:16:08.782
Kiki, stop it.
I'm trying to help you.

01:16:11.285 --> 01:16:12.819
Here we go.

01:16:15.322 --> 01:16:16.723
We know each other.

[deranged laughing]

01:16:23.864 --> 01:16:24.000
Oh, oh.

Oh, oh.

Hey, hey, Steve Pat Fontaine.

01:16:57.415 --> 01:16:59.517
Steve Pat Fontaine, hi.

01:17:00.451 --> 01:17:01.919
What is it, Spencer?

01:17:01.919 --> 01:17:04.989
I just want to congratulate you
on a race well run.

01:17:04.989 --> 01:17:08.192
I mean, all that money going
towards fighting feet cancer.

01:17:08.192 --> 01:17:10.127
-Breast cancer.
-Breast cancer.

01:17:10.127 --> 01:17:12.964
You must feel like King Tit.

01:17:12.964 --> 01:17:16.701
I don't know how I'm gonna break
the news to the sad, little boys

01:17:16.701 --> 01:17:18.436
in the prostate land, but...

01:17:18.436 --> 01:17:19.837
Keep your share.

01:17:19.837 --> 01:17:21.305
That money should go to
fighting prostate cancer.

01:17:21.305 --> 01:17:25.610
Oh, thank you, 'cause my family
history does not bode well.

01:17:25.610 --> 01:17:30.548
And this Nitro Venom is wreaking
havoc on my internal organs.

01:17:30.548 --> 01:17:32.884
I mean, I look like a nut sack.

01:17:32.884 --> 01:17:36.153
I don't why I'm talking like
this, Patty-Cakes,

01:17:36.153 --> 01:17:38.055
but I've just got one question.

01:17:38.055 --> 01:17:42.927
On the finish line,
did I poop a little?

01:17:42.927 --> 01:17:44.395
No, you're good.

01:17:44.395 --> 01:17:46.163
Oh, good 'cause that
would be embarrassing.

01:17:46.163 --> 01:17:48.432
-Spencer.
-Yeah?

01:17:48.432 --> 01:17:50.001
I beat you.

01:17:50.001 --> 01:17:53.404
Yeah, but Patty Longlegs...
[heart rate accelerates]

01:17:53.404 --> 01:17:56.807
All right, all right...

<i>I just ran almost every day.</i>

01:18:04.649 --> 01:18:07.251
<i>Because being in the race</i>

01:18:07.251 --> 01:18:09.720

watching from the sidelines.

01:18:23.868 --> 01:18:25.703
You know, 'cause I had plenty
left in the tank,

01:18:25.703 --> 01:18:27.104
so...

01:18:27.104 --> 01:18:30.141
Well, you know, Olympic race
walking is four miles longer

01:18:30.141 --> 01:18:31.542
than a marathon.

01:18:31.542 --> 01:18:32.710
Oh my God, that's it.

01:18:32.710 --> 01:18:33.878
You're gonna be a race walker.

01:18:33.878 --> 01:18:36.914
No, ew. God no. No.
Ultra marathon.

01:18:36.914 --> 01:18:38.516
Of course,
I would need all new gear.

01:18:38.516 --> 01:18:40.051
Hey Google, take a note,

01:18:40.051 --> 01:18:42.954
head lamp, racing snorkle,
closed-loop filtration in case

01:18:42.954 --> 01:18:46.223
I have to drink my own urine.
Blow darts for predators.

they have arugula salad.

-Wait, you're not seeing?
-No, I'm not seeing anyone.

01:18:55.199 --> 01:18:57.768
I'm not seeing anyone either.

01:18:57.768 --> 01:19:00.504
-So what was your final time?
-Two fifty-six.

01:19:00.504 --> 01:19:03.474
Wait. Two fifty-six?
Is that a world record?

01:19:03.474 --> 01:19:05.610
-Yeah, yeah.
-No, but it's good.

01:19:05.610 --> 01:19:06.944
It's good.
It's good.

01:19:06.944 --> 01:19:08.512
What about you?
Think you'll run another one?

01:19:08.512 --> 01:19:10.481
Uh, let's see,
I'm unemployed now,

01:19:10.481 --> 01:19:12.350
so I have plenty
of time to train

01:19:12.350 --> 01:19:15.186
and I think I love running.

01:19:15.186 --> 01:19:16.754
-Hmm.
-Yeah.

01:19:16.754 --> 01:19:21.359
It's good to know what
I want finally and go after it.

01:19:21.359 --> 01:19:23.728
On that note,
you should get your tab

01:19:23.728 --> 01:19:26.063
and we should get out of here.

01:19:26.063 --> 01:19:28.633
Oh, uh, wow.

01:19:28.633 --> 01:19:31.802
What makes you think I wanna go
on a date with you?

01:19:31.802 --> 01:19:34.038
Not a date, not a date.
Um...

01:19:34.038 --> 01:19:37.642
more of a post-marathon thing?
I don't know.

01:19:37.642 --> 01:19:39.777
Something--
Something's different about you.

01:19:39.777 --> 01:19:42.446
And, um, my endorphins
are raging and--

01:19:42.446 --> 01:19:46.384
Oh, uh, I would love to

01:19:46.384 --> 01:19:48.653
probably more than anything,
but, um,

01:19:48.653 --> 01:19:50.821
can I take a rain check?

01:19:50.821 --> 01:19:54.225
I, uh, have to go
see about a guy.

01:19:56.293 --> 01:19:57.094
Cool.

01:19:59.497 --> 01:20:01.499
[doorbell rings]

01:20:03.901 --> 01:20:05.603
Hey, man, you're three hours
late!

01:20:05.603 --> 01:20:07.004
I'm sorry!
I was having sex with Julie.

01:20:07.004 --> 01:20:08.439
I tried to postpone it,
but she wasn't having it.

01:20:08.439 --> 01:20:10.608
Apparently, it's a post-marathon
thing, so I had to do it,

01:20:10.608 --> 01:20:12.343
but I wanted to do it.
Do you know what I mean?

01:20:12.343 --> 01:20:14.345
I was really lucky to be having
sex with somebody like her,

01:20:14.345 --> 01:20:15.880
so that's where I was.

01:20:15.880 --> 01:20:17.081
Awesome!

01:20:17.081 --> 01:20:19.817
Yeah, yeah, it was.

01:20:19.817 --> 01:20:22.620
Dude, you just ran a marathon
and had sex for three hours.

01:20:22.620 --> 01:20:25.456
-How are you not asleep?
-I don't know.

01:20:25.456 --> 01:20:27.091
But I feel great.

01:20:27.091 --> 01:20:28.526
Also, who is Julie?

01:20:28.526 --> 01:20:30.428
Is she coming? 'Cause I could
put some more pizza bagels in.

01:20:30.428 --> 01:20:31.762
-Does she have a friend?
-No.

01:20:32.663 --> 01:20:34.398
-She has family!
-She has family!

01:20:34.799 --> 01:20:36.100
I hope it's a freaky stepmom!
