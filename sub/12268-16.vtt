WEBVTT

00:01.502 --> 00:02.473
PREVIOUSLY ON "REVENGE"...

00:02.473 --> 00:03.504
WE HAVE TO GET HIM
TO A HOSPITAL.

00:03.504 --> 00:05.076
I GOTTA GET OUTTA HERE
AND FINISH WHAT AMANDA STARTED

00:05.076 --> 00:07.438
BEFORE IT'S TOO LATE.
THE GRAYSONS FRAMED HER FATHER.

00:07.438 --> 00:09.410
NOW THAT CONRAD'S RUNNING
FOR GOVERNOR,

00:09.410 --> 00:10.481
HE'LL BE FORCED
TO VACATE HIS SEAT

00:10.481 --> 00:11.682
ON GRAYSON GLOBAL'S BOARD,

00:11.682 --> 00:13.714
WHICH MEANS THAT YOU CAN GET
CLOSER TO DANIEL.

00:13.714 --> 00:15.046
LOOK, WE MAKE ONE HELL
OF A TEAM.

00:15.046 --> 00:16.187
YOU DEAL ME BACK IN,
AND I SWEAR,

00:16.187 --> 00:17.618
THE SKY'S THE LIMIT.

00:17.618 --> 00:18.649
IN SPITE
OF OUR STRAINED HISTORY,

00:18.649 --> 00:21.092
AMANDA WAS, UM, FAMILY,

00:21.092 --> 00:22.553
AS ARE YOU AND YOUR SON.

00:22.553 --> 00:23.794
ON TOP OF ALL THE MISERY,

00:23.794 --> 00:25.756
TO FIND OUT THAT YOU WERE
LYING TO ME, TOO?

00:25.756 --> 00:27.798
DID YOU KNOW ABOUT HER PLAN
FOR THE GRAYSONS?

00:27.798 --> 00:29.600
JACK, I AM SO SORRY
ABOUT EVERYTHING.

00:29.600 --> 00:31.062
I DON'T HAVE TIME
FOR THIS.

00:31.062 --> 00:32.503
I'VE GOTTA BURY MY WIFE
IN AN HOUR.

00:32.503 --> 00:34.765
HOPING I COULD COME BY
AND VISIT YOU NEXT WEEK,

00:34.765 --> 00:36.607
TALK ABOUT FINDING A WAY
TO HONOR AMANDA.

00:36.607 --> 00:38.569
MY DOOR IS ALWAYS OPEN.

00:38.569 --> 00:40.371
THE AMANDA CLARKE I KNEW
WAS A SURVIVOR.

00:40.371 --> 00:42.143
WHO ARE YOU?

00:42.143 --> 00:43.444
I'M HER BROTHER.

00:45.516 --> 00:49.420
(David) "OH, A MATCH.

00:49.420 --> 00:51.252
IT MIGHT AFFORD HER
A WORLD OF COMFORT..."

00:51.252 --> 00:53.254
IF ONLY SHE DARED
TO STRIKE ONE."

00:53.254 --> 00:55.086
(chuckles)

00:55.086 --> 00:56.787
"IT WAS A BRIGHT
AND WONDROUS FLAME,

00:56.787 --> 00:58.489
"LIKE A CANDLE,

00:58.489 --> 01:01.132
"AND SHE CAREFULLY
WARMED HER HANDS OVER IT.

01:01.132 --> 01:02.633
IT WAS..."

01:02.633 --> 01:05.495
"A WONDERFUL LIGHT."

01:05.495 --> 01:09.240
(Emily) TO CARRY A SECRET
 IS TO PLAY WITH FIRE.

01:09.240 --> 01:10.741
TRY TO PASS IT ON,

01:10.741 --> 01:14.675
AND YOU RISK
 HURTING SOMEONE ELSE.

01:14.675 --> 01:17.848
HOLD ON TO IT...

01:17.848 --> 01:20.411
AND EVENTUALLY,
 YOU'LL GET BURNED.

01:20.411 --> 01:23.814
ARE YOU CERTAIN THAT NOBODY
KNOWS ABOUT THIS PLACE?

01:25.486 --> 01:27.818
NOT A CHANCE.

01:27.818 --> 01:29.820
THIS IS OUR SAFE HAVEN.

01:29.820 --> 01:32.493
AND YOU DEFINITELY LOOK LIKE
YOU'RE IN NEED OF ONE.

01:32.493 --> 01:33.824
MM.

01:33.824 --> 01:35.326
WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN?

01:35.326 --> 01:38.499
(exhales)
I WENT TO THE CEMETERY...

01:38.499 --> 01:41.702
TO HAVE A QUIET MOMENT
WITH MY FATHER AND AMANDA.

01:44.475 --> 01:47.438
I CAN IMAGINE THE DEPTHS
THAT SOLITUDE BROUGHT YOU TO.

01:49.740 --> 01:53.444
(exhales)
I WASN'T ALONE, AIDEN.

01:53.444 --> 01:55.546
MY FOSTER BROTHER
SHOWED UP.

01:55.546 --> 01:57.488
I HAVEN'T SEEN HIM IN...

01:57.488 --> 01:59.620
14 YEARS.

01:59.620 --> 02:01.852
I... I ASSUME
HE DIDN'T RECOGNIZE YOU.

02:01.852 --> 02:03.194
NO.

02:03.194 --> 02:05.356
NO, BUT HIM BEING HERE
IS THE LAST THING

02:05.356 --> 02:07.628
THAT I NEED RIGHT NOW.

02:07.628 --> 02:11.532
HAVE YOU ANY REASON TO
THINK HE MAY WISH YOU ILL?

02:11.532 --> 02:14.605
I BURNED DOWN OUR HOUSE.

02:14.605 --> 02:15.766
(strikes)

02:18.839 --> 02:20.211
(inhales)

02:20.211 --> 02:21.912
(blows air)

02:29.149 --> 02:32.383
(boy) WHY DO YOU ALWAYS DRAW
THE SAME THING?

02:32.383 --> 02:34.725
SO I NEVER FORGET
WHAT MY FATHER DID.

02:34.725 --> 02:36.357
KILLED ALL THOSE PEOPLE?

02:36.357 --> 02:37.658
HE LIED TO ME.

02:37.658 --> 02:38.829
(woman)
WHO'S LIGHTING MATCHES?

02:38.829 --> 02:39.790
HIDE.

02:39.790 --> 02:41.332
(footsteps approach)

02:41.332 --> 02:44.164
AMANDA! ELI!

02:44.164 --> 02:47.438
WHAT DID I SAY
ABOUT PLAYING WITH FIRE?

02:47.438 --> 02:49.240
WHERE'S AMANDA?

02:49.240 --> 02:50.741
I HAVEN'T SEEN HER.

02:50.741 --> 02:53.804
LIAR. INTO THE BIN.
LET'S GO.

02:53.804 --> 02:55.506
(sighs)

02:55.506 --> 02:58.178
ELI WAS MY PROTECTOR.

02:58.178 --> 02:59.850
AND IN RETURN,

02:59.850 --> 03:02.883
I PROMISED NEVER TO LET
ANYTHING SEPARATE US.

03:02.883 --> 03:06.917
AND NOTHING EVER DID UNTIL...

03:06.917 --> 03:09.460
I SET THAT FIRE.

03:13.824 --> 03:16.927
(seagulls calling)

03:16.927 --> 03:18.699
I HAVE A TON MORE
FROM THE WEDDING

03:18.699 --> 03:20.231
IF YOU NEED ME
TO PRINT THEM OUT.

03:20.231 --> 03:21.932
OH, NO. I THINK
THESE WILL SUFFICE.

03:21.932 --> 03:24.405
MOM, THIS IDEA FOR
A FOUNDATION IN AMANDA'S NAME,

03:24.405 --> 03:26.407
IT'S SUCH AN AMAZING WAY
TO HONOR HER.

03:26.407 --> 03:28.479
FOR YOU TO BE DEDICATING
YOUR TIME TO IT,

03:28.479 --> 03:31.342
I'M JUST SO PROUD
OF YOU BOTH.

03:32.783 --> 03:34.785
SEE YOU, SWEETHEART.

03:34.785 --> 03:37.248
OH, GOOD MORNING, DANIEL.

03:37.248 --> 03:39.790
HOW DID YOU SLEEP?

03:39.790 --> 03:40.921
I DIDN'T.

03:40.921 --> 03:42.453
I'M STILL
TRYING TO FIGURE OUT

03:42.453 --> 03:44.625
WHAT THE INITIATIVE IS PLANNING
AND HOW TO STOP IT.

03:44.625 --> 03:46.457
THE SUCCESS
OF THEIR SCHEMES LIES

03:46.457 --> 03:48.299
IN KEEPING
THE PIECES DISPARATE

03:48.299 --> 03:50.901
SO AS TO PREVENT ANYONE
FROM CONNECTING THE DOTS.

03:50.901 --> 03:52.903
YOU'D DO BETTER CONCENTRATING
ON DEFLECTING THE BLAME.

03:52.903 --> 03:54.805
BY PLACING IT
ON AIDEN MATHIS.

03:54.805 --> 03:56.337
BETTER HIM THAN YOU.

03:56.337 --> 03:57.738
EVEN AFTER HE PROVED
HIS LOYALTY?

03:57.738 --> 03:59.570
YOU NEED TO WATCH YOUR BACK
WITH THAT ONE.

03:59.570 --> 04:01.472
HAVE YOU FORGOTTEN
HIS PURSUIT OF EMILY?

04:01.472 --> 04:03.874
AND HE WAS INSTRUMENTAL
IN MY OUSTING AT THE COMPANY,

04:03.874 --> 04:04.845
WAS HE NOT?

04:04.845 --> 04:06.377
NO MORE SO THAN I WAS.

04:06.377 --> 04:07.548
YEAH, A BETRAYAL FOR WHICH

04:07.548 --> 04:08.879
I'VE ONLY JUST BEGUN
TO FORGIVE YOU,

04:08.879 --> 04:10.381
BUT YOU ARE MY BLOOD.

04:10.381 --> 04:12.823
MATHIS IS
A... COMMON PARASITE.

04:12.823 --> 04:15.756
WOULD YOU SAY THE SAME
ABOUT DAVID CLARKE

04:15.756 --> 04:19.259
OR HIS DAUGHTER?
MM.

04:19.259 --> 04:21.762
(cup clatters)
 I KNOW RUINING LIVES
IS IN YOUR D.N.A.,

04:21.762 --> 04:23.764
BUT I'M NOT ALLOWING
ANOTHER INNOCENT PERSON

04:23.764 --> 04:26.337
TO PAY THE PRICE
FOR OUR SINS.

04:31.872 --> 04:33.844
(man) I WISH THAT
I COULD EXPEDITE THE CLAIM

04:33.844 --> 04:35.546
ON YOUR WIFE'S POLICY,

04:35.546 --> 04:37.007
BUT I'M AFRAID IT WON'T BE
FULLY PROCESSED

04:37.007 --> 04:39.750
UNTIL THE CRIMINAL INVESTIGATION
IS CLOSED.

04:39.750 --> 04:41.582
I UNDERSTAND.

04:41.582 --> 04:43.714
IF IT WOULD GIVE YOU
PEACE OF MIND...

04:43.714 --> 04:44.885
(Carl cooing)

04:44.885 --> 04:46.857
I COULD SET UP
A LIFE INSURANCE POLICY

04:46.857 --> 04:49.019
TO MAKE SURE THAT YOUR BABY
IS TAKEN CARE OF...

04:49.019 --> 04:52.763
IN THE UNLIKELY EVENT
OF ANOTHER TRAGEDY.

04:54.725 --> 04:56.627
YEAH.

04:56.627 --> 04:59.400
I THINK THAT'D BE
A GOOD IDEA.

04:59.400 --> 05:03.374
I'LL DRAW UP THE PAPERWORK
AND I'LL GIVE YOU A CALL.

05:03.374 --> 05:05.476
THANKS.

05:07.608 --> 05:10.781
(cooing continues)

05:10.781 --> 05:11.912
HEY.

05:11.912 --> 05:13.614
YOU OKAY?
 (door closes)

05:13.614 --> 05:15.416
(exhales)
I'M JUST GOING CRAZY

05:15.416 --> 05:18.789
TRYING TO MAKE SENSE
OF THAT NIGHT.

05:18.789 --> 05:21.091
WHAT HAPPENED OUT THERE?

05:21.091 --> 05:22.793
SOMEBODY PULLS ME
OUT OF THE WATER,

05:22.793 --> 05:25.556
CALLS AN AMBULANCE FOR ME,
DOESN'T LEAVE A NAME?

05:25.556 --> 05:27.758
I'M STILL TRYING TO FIGURE OUT
WHY NOLAN TOLD ME

05:27.758 --> 05:29.059
YOU TWO HAD CHECKED IN
TO THE HOTEL IN NANTUCKET.

05:29.059 --> 05:30.531
HE SAID THAT?

05:32.733 --> 05:34.505
YEAH. I GOTTA GO.
(clears throat)

05:36.807 --> 05:41.071
(cooing continues)

05:41.071 --> 05:43.944
(cell phone rings)

05:43.944 --> 05:46.917
(ring)

05:46.917 --> 05:48.449
HELLO.

05:48.449 --> 05:51.522
Jack,
it's Victoria Grayson.

05:51.522 --> 05:53.524
I KNOW HOW DIFFICULT
THIS TIME IS FOR YOU RIGHT NOW,

05:53.524 --> 05:55.786
SO PLEASE ALLOW ME
TO BE BRIEF.

05:55.786 --> 05:56.887
I APPRECIATE THAT.

05:56.887 --> 05:58.929
Well, Conrad and I
remain devastated

05:58.929 --> 06:00.861
over your terrible loss.

06:00.861 --> 06:03.764
AND WE ASKED OURSELVES
HOW WE COULD KEEP AMANDA ALIVE

06:03.764 --> 06:05.996
IN MORE THAN JUST OUR HEARTS.

06:05.996 --> 06:07.698
So we arrived at this idea

06:07.698 --> 06:09.700
of creating a foundation
in her name.

06:09.700 --> 06:11.001
YOU MEAN LIKE A CHARITY?

06:11.001 --> 06:12.843
Precisely.

06:12.843 --> 06:15.506
IN LIGHT OF
AMANDA'S DIFFICULT CHILDHOOD,

06:15.506 --> 06:18.679
WE THOUGHT OUR GOAL COULD BE
A BETTER TOMORROW BY PROMOTING

06:18.679 --> 06:20.681
and protecting the well-being
of children today.

06:20.681 --> 06:22.683
We could call it
The Amanda Clarke Foundation

06:22.683 --> 06:25.716
or The Amanda Porter Foundation
if you like.

06:25.716 --> 06:27.918
AMANDA CLARKE'S
MORE APPROPRIATE.

06:27.918 --> 06:29.990
THEN CAN I SAY
WE HAVE YOUR BLESSING?

06:29.990 --> 06:32.863
YEAH, YOU HAVE MY BLESSING.

06:32.863 --> 06:34.865
THANK YOU.
I'LL SPEAK TO YOU SOON.

06:34.865 --> 06:36.396
(footsteps approach)

06:36.396 --> 06:38.729
(cell phone beeps)
 WHAT A WONDERFUL IDEA.

06:38.729 --> 06:40.130
I HOPE I'M NOT INTERRUPTING.

06:40.130 --> 06:42.402
CHARLOTTE CALLED ME AND TOLD ME
WHAT YOU WERE UP TO,

06:42.402 --> 06:44.875
AND I WOULD LOVE
TO OFFER MY SERVICES

06:44.875 --> 06:46.807
AS CO-CHAIR, VICTORIA.

06:46.807 --> 06:48.479
WHAT DO YOU THINK?

06:48.479 --> 06:50.140
(doorbell rings)

06:50.140 --> 06:51.842
OH, A QUARTER
OF A MILLION DOLLARS.

06:51.842 --> 06:54.114
THAT'S VERY GENEROUS.

06:54.114 --> 06:56.887
I'LL TAKE YOUR OFFER
UNDER CONSIDERATION.

06:56.887 --> 06:59.550
PARDON ME. THERE'S A YOUNG MAN
AT THE DOOR.

06:59.550 --> 07:01.091
HE SAYS
HE'S AMANDA CLARKE'S BROTHER.

07:01.091 --> 07:04.795
FOSTER BROTHER
TO BE SPECIFIC.

07:04.795 --> 07:06.096
ELI JAMES.

07:06.096 --> 07:09.530
IT'S AN HONOR TO MEET YOU,
MRS. GRAYSON.

07:25.546 --> 07:27.017
MY APOLOGIES, MR. JAMES,
BUT THIS IS QUITE UNEXPECTED.

07:27.017 --> 07:30.150
MM. WELL, AS WAS THE NEWS
OF MY SISTER'S DEATH.

07:30.150 --> 07:32.152
YOUR DAUGHTER CHARLOTTE
INVITED ME.

07:32.152 --> 07:35.225
UNFORTUNATELY, WITHOUT ENOUGH
LEAD TIME TO MAKE THE FUNERAL.

07:35.225 --> 07:37.688
WELL,
IT WAS A LOVELY CEREMONY.

07:37.688 --> 07:39.990
I'M SURE AMANDA WOULD'VE
APPRECIATED THE FACT

07:39.990 --> 07:42.132
THAT YOU DID EVERYTHING
YOU COULD TO BE THERE.

07:42.132 --> 07:43.994
MR. JAMES,

07:43.994 --> 07:45.135
EMILY THORNE.

07:47.097 --> 07:49.840
YOU LOOK... FAMILIAR.
DO I KNOW YOU?

07:49.840 --> 07:51.842
WE MET AT THE CEMETERY.

07:51.842 --> 07:53.774
OF COURSE. OF COURSE.

07:53.774 --> 07:56.076
YOU SAID THAT YOU, UH,
KNEW AMANDA WELL.

07:56.076 --> 08:00.711
I-I DID.
I'M HER BABY'S GODMOTHER.

08:04.855 --> 08:06.857
SHE LOOKS HAPPY.

08:06.857 --> 08:08.859
HOW LONG ARE YOU IN TOWN FOR,
MR. JAMES?

08:08.859 --> 08:10.721
I HADN'T PUT A CLOCK ON IT.

08:10.721 --> 08:12.222
I WAS ON MY WAY BACK
FROM BUSINESS IN LONDON

08:12.222 --> 08:13.764
WHEN I HEARD THE NEWS.

08:13.764 --> 08:15.726
WELL, WHAT LINE
OF BUSINESS ARE YOU IN?

08:15.726 --> 08:16.867
RARE BOOKS.

08:16.867 --> 08:18.729
FASCINATING.

08:18.729 --> 08:20.030
WELL,
IF YOUR SCHEDULE ALLOWS,

08:20.030 --> 08:22.673
WE WOULD LOVE FOR YOU
TO BE AN HONORED GUEST

08:22.673 --> 08:25.035
AT THE INAUGURAL BENEFIT
IN YOUR SISTER'S NAME.

08:25.035 --> 08:26.637
I WOULD LOVE TO.

08:26.637 --> 08:27.808
(cell phone rings)

08:27.808 --> 08:28.779
EXCUSE ME.

08:28.779 --> 08:30.781
(rings and beeps)

08:30.781 --> 08:31.812
HELLO.

08:31.812 --> 08:33.914
OH, HEY. I'M AT YOUR HOUSE.

08:33.914 --> 08:35.645
WHERE ARE YOU?

08:35.645 --> 08:36.986
I'M WITH VICTORIA.

08:36.986 --> 08:40.220
SHE'S PUTTING TOGETHER
A FOUNDATION IN HONOR OF AMANDA.

08:40.220 --> 08:41.991
I WANTED TO SEE
HOW I COULD HELP.

08:41.991 --> 08:45.756
I BET YOU DID. WELL...
DON'T LET ME INTERRUPT.

08:45.756 --> 08:47.598
OH, MY GOD.
I COMPLETELY FORGOT.

08:47.598 --> 08:50.200
STAY THERE.
I'LL BE RIGHT DOWN.
 (beep)

08:51.632 --> 08:52.863
(chuckles)
 (beep)

08:52.863 --> 08:55.806
I AM SO SORRY. I AM LATE
FOR A BREAKFAST MEETING.

08:55.806 --> 08:58.308
UM, MAYBE I CAN
CALL YOU LATER, VICTORIA,

08:58.308 --> 09:00.571
TO CONTINUE OUR DISCUSSION?
 CERTAINLY.

09:00.571 --> 09:01.742
IT WAS A PLEASURE
TO MEET YOU.

09:01.742 --> 09:02.913
THANKS.

09:02.913 --> 09:05.075
AND SINCE I'LL BE
STAYING FOR A WHILE,

09:05.075 --> 09:06.977
I LOOK FORWARD
TO GETTING TO KNOW YOU...

09:06.977 --> 09:11.181
AND ALL THE PEOPLE WHO KNEW
MY SISTER, OF COURSE.

09:15.125 --> 09:17.758
MM. SPEAKING OF WHICH,
IS, UH, CHARLOTTE HERE?

09:17.758 --> 09:19.930
I WANTED TO SAY THANK YOU
FOR INVITING ME.

09:19.930 --> 09:21.862
OH, I'M AFRAID
MY DAUGHTER'S STILL AT SCHOOL.

09:21.862 --> 09:23.864
BUT I'M SURE AMANDA'S HUSBAND
WOULD LOVE TO MEET YOU,

09:23.864 --> 09:26.136
AND I CAN GIVE YOU DIRECTIONS
TO HIS TAVERN.

09:26.136 --> 09:28.038
PERFECT.

09:28.038 --> 09:30.570
I DON'T EVEN KNOW HIM, NOLAN.
I WAS 13.

09:30.570 --> 09:31.872
BUT I HIGHLY DOUBT
THAT HE WAS IN LONDON

09:31.872 --> 09:33.573
BUYING ANTIQUE BOOKS
LAST WEEK.

09:33.573 --> 09:37.207
WELL, YOU THINK WE COULD BE
DEALING WITH ANOTHER TYLER?

09:37.207 --> 09:40.751
TYLER WAS SICK.
ELI IS A WILD CARD.

09:40.751 --> 09:43.854
BUT IF HE FIGURES OUT WHO I AM,
HE COULD RUIN EVERYTHING.

09:43.854 --> 09:45.986
MM. WELL,
I'LL CHECK HIM OUT.

09:45.986 --> 09:48.258
SO LONG AS PADMA'S
IN A HOLDING PATTERN

09:48.258 --> 09:49.820
WITH THE INITIATIVE,

09:49.820 --> 09:51.862
IT'LL BE
A WELCOME DISTRACTION.

09:51.862 --> 09:53.994
THEY HAVEN'T
REACHED OUT TO HER YET?
 NOT A PEEP.

09:53.994 --> 09:56.827
SHE'S IN SECLUSION
UNTIL THEY DO.

09:58.899 --> 09:59.970

09:59.970 --> 10:01.732

BEFORE ELI DOES.

IN YOUR AFTERNOON TUMBLER.

10:14.845 --> 10:17.888
OH, I'M SORRY IF I CAN'T
RECONCILE THE TAKING OF A LIFE

10:17.888 --> 10:19.389
AS EASILY AS YOU.

10:19.389 --> 10:21.822
THE NAME "AMANDA CLARKE"

10:21.822 --> 10:23.794
KEEPS RINGING MY EARS.

10:23.794 --> 10:26.727
WELL, THEN WE HAVE
SOMETHING IN COMMON.

10:26.727 --> 10:28.729
BUT WHERE YOU LET IT
CONSUME YOU,

10:28.729 --> 10:31.862
YOUR MOTHER AND I HAVE CHOSEN
TO RESURRECT HER.

10:31.862 --> 10:34.905
OH, BY SLAPPING HER NAME
ON A CHARITY.

10:34.905 --> 10:36.907
IF I RECALL, YOU DID
THE EXACT SAME THING

10:36.907 --> 10:38.809
WHEN YOU CREATED
THE VICTIMS UNITED FUND

10:38.809 --> 10:41.271
AFTER THE CRASH
OF FLIGHT 1-9-7.

10:41.271 --> 10:43.714
WELL, IT'S A BIT OF GOOD
BORN OF TRAGEDY.

10:43.714 --> 10:45.716

BY THE WAY,

10:45.716 --> 10:47.177
HELP ME SLEEP
A LITTLE BETTER.

10:47.177 --> 10:49.649
HOPEFULLY A SIMILAR GESTURE

10:49.649 --> 10:52.282
WILL DO THE SAME FOR YOU.

10:52.282 --> 10:54.825
AND WHAT EXACTLY
IS IN MY FUTURE,

11:08.999 --> 11:11.401

2 LENGTHS BEHIND,

11:11.401 --> 11:14.304

DOWN MEMORY LANE.

TO OUTRUN MY NAME...

CHECK OUT FAUX BRO

27:12.662 --> 27:14.633
CLIMBING MOUNT GRAYSON
LIKE IT AIN'T NO THANG.

27:14.633 --> 27:17.036
(Eli speaks indistinctly)
 I'M GONNA GO OVER THERE.

27:17.036 --> 27:18.808
AND EVEN THOUGH IT'S BEEN
OVER A DECADE

27:18.808 --> 27:20.670
SINCE I LAST SAW HER...

27:20.670 --> 27:21.640
♪♪♪

27:21.640 --> 27:25.715
SHE LEFT
A LIFELONG IMPRESSION.

27:25.715 --> 27:28.217
SHE WAS AMAZING, WASN'T SHE?

27:28.217 --> 27:30.649
(Emily) SHE WAS.

27:30.649 --> 27:33.082
AMANDA TOLD ME THAT
SHE FELT SO MUCH GUILT

27:33.082 --> 27:35.284
FOR WHAT SHE DID,

27:35.284 --> 27:37.727
STARTING THAT FIRE.

27:37.727 --> 27:39.689
YOU MUST BLAME HER
TO SOME DEGREE.

27:39.689 --> 27:42.061
WHAT IS THIS ABOUT?

27:42.061 --> 27:44.794
WELL, THE FOSTER HOME
WHERE WE LIVED,

27:44.794 --> 27:47.166
AMANDA AND I
WERE CALLED INVISIBLES--

27:47.166 --> 27:49.198
THE KIND OF KIDS
ADOPTIVE PARENTS

27:49.198 --> 27:50.970
WANTED NOTHING TO DO WITH--

27:50.970 --> 27:52.702
TOO OLD, TOO JADED.

27:52.702 --> 27:55.975
ONLY THING WE HAD TO RELY ON
WAS EACH OTHER.

27:55.975 --> 27:59.448
UNTIL ONE DAY, IT LOOKED LIKE
A FAMILY MIGHT ACTUALLY

27:59.448 --> 28:01.680
TAKE HER IN AFTER ALL.

28:01.680 --> 28:03.052
I ALWAYS THOUGHT THAT

28:03.052 --> 28:05.785
SHE STARTED THAT FIRE
SO THEY WOULDN'T WANT HER,

28:05.785 --> 28:07.917
AND...
 (doorbell rings)

28:07.917 --> 28:09.719
WE COULD STAY TOGETHER.

28:09.719 --> 28:12.391
I DON'T THINK I COULD IMAGINE
A SADDER WAY TO GROW UP.

28:12.391 --> 28:13.793
IT WASN'T EASY,

28:13.793 --> 28:15.925
ESPECIALLY FOR AMANDA.

28:15.925 --> 28:18.828
SHE WAS A TROUBLED GIRL.

28:18.828 --> 28:20.469
WELL, WHO'S TO JUDGE?

28:20.469 --> 28:22.471
AFTER THE HAND
LIFE DEALT HER,

28:22.471 --> 28:24.904
WHOSE DAUGHTER SHE WAS...

28:24.904 --> 28:26.405
AND YET, HERE YOU ARE,

28:26.405 --> 28:28.878
A SHINING EXAMPLE OF A CHILD
WHO PERSEVERED--

28:28.878 --> 28:31.080
FROM A FOSTER HOME
TO COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY.

28:31.080 --> 28:33.783
WELL, IN THE FACE OF TRAGEDY,
I COUNT MYSELF LUCKY.

28:33.783 --> 28:36.846
AFTER THE FIRE, I WENT ON
TO A BETTER HOME,

28:36.846 --> 28:40.920
A FAMILY WHO ADOPTED ME
AND GAVE ME A REAL EDUCATION.

28:40.920 --> 28:43.222
WHICH IS WHY I...

28:43.222 --> 28:47.126
WANTED TO DONATE THIS
TO THE CAUSE.

28:47.126 --> 28:50.159
(paper rustles)

28:50.159 --> 28:51.831
$100,000.

28:51.831 --> 28:53.062
MM.

28:53.062 --> 28:55.805
(laughs)
 IN HONOR OF AMANDA,

28:55.805 --> 28:59.208
AND ALL OF
THE... INVISIBLE CHILDREN.
 (music stops,
microphone feedback whines)

28:59.208 --> 29:00.509
(Jack, amplified voice)
UH... (clears throat)

29:00.509 --> 29:02.812
EVENING, EVERYONE.

29:02.812 --> 29:04.743
I'M JACK PORTER. UH...

29:04.743 --> 29:08.247
(guests murmuring)
 I WASN'T SURE IF I WAS EVEN
GONNA MAKE IT TONIGHT.

29:08.247 --> 29:10.749
I DIDN'T KNOW IF I COULD
FACE REALITY.

29:10.749 --> 29:12.051
AMANDA WAS--

29:12.051 --> 29:14.423
SHE WAS MY WIFE.

29:14.423 --> 29:16.755
BUT IN LIGHT OF EVERYTHING...

29:16.755 --> 29:19.458
THAT, UH, HAPPENED,

29:19.458 --> 29:21.260
I REALIZED...

29:21.260 --> 29:25.064
I CAN COUNT MY TRUE FRIENDS
ON ONE HAND.

29:26.295 --> 29:28.767
AND THE GRAYSONS
ARE AMONG THEM.

29:28.767 --> 29:32.301
SO, VICTORIA, CONRAD,
THANK YOU...

29:32.301 --> 29:34.303
FOR GIVING ME HOPE

29:34.303 --> 29:37.176
THAT SOMETHING GOOD
MIGHT COME FROM ALL THIS.

29:37.176 --> 29:39.809
THANK YOU ALL
FOR BEING HERE.

29:39.809 --> 29:42.912
(applause)

29:47.786 --> 29:51.220
WE APPLAUD YOUR BRAVERY,
MR. PORTER.

29:51.220 --> 29:53.792
THANK YOU, EVERYONE,
FOR BEING HERE TONIGHT

29:53.792 --> 29:55.794
AND FOR HELPING US LAUNCH
THE AMANDA CLARKE FOUNDATION...

29:55.794 --> 29:57.096
(lowered voice) JACK,

29:57.096 --> 29:58.397
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

29:58.397 --> 29:59.528
PRACTICING.

29:59.528 --> 30:00.930
PRACTICING WHAT?

30:00.930 --> 30:03.402
LYING THROUGH MY TEETH
LIKE YOU AND EMILY.

30:03.402 --> 30:04.904
WHOA, WHOA, BUDDY--

30:04.904 --> 30:07.806
I FOUND THE GUY THAT YOU
BOUGHT "THE ROSE GRAY" FROM.

30:07.806 --> 30:09.138
WHAT THE HELL'S
"THE ROSE GRAY"?

30:09.138 --> 30:10.910
THE BOAT, NOLAN.

30:10.910 --> 30:12.411
YOU WERE THE ONE
WHO RESCUED ME.

30:12.411 --> 30:15.184
YOU WERE THERE
THE NIGHT AMANDA DIED.

30:15.184 --> 30:16.515
OKAY, JACK, LISTEN, I--

30:16.515 --> 30:17.847
NO, NO, NO, NO.

30:17.847 --> 30:20.519
I'M DONE LISTENING
TO YOU.

30:20.519 --> 30:22.221
IF YOU OR EMILY
WERE MY REAL FRIENDS,

30:22.221 --> 30:24.093
YOU WOULD'VE TOLD ME
THE TRUTH IN THE BEGINNING.

30:24.093 --> 30:25.925
AND YOU WOULDN'T BE HERE
RUBBING ELBOWS

30:25.925 --> 30:29.098
WITH THE PEOPLE
RESPONSIBLE FOR HER DEATH,

30:29.098 --> 30:32.231
THE VERY PEOPLE
SHE CAME HERE TO DESTROY.

30:37.366 --> 30:39.869
WHAT WAS THAT ABOUT?

30:39.869 --> 30:41.210
(clears throat)

30:41.210 --> 30:43.472
UH, NOTHING I CAN'T HANDLE.

30:43.472 --> 30:46.845
YOU'VE GOT YOUR HANDS FULL
RIGHT NOW.

30:46.845 --> 30:47.846
(Victoria) ...FAR REACHING,

30:47.846 --> 30:49.618
NOT TO MENTION
VIGOROUS AND BOLD,

30:49.618 --> 30:51.620
WHICH IS WHY I SIMPLY CAN'T
IMAGINE A BETTER SOUL

30:51.620 --> 30:54.984
TO JOIN ME AS CO-CHAIR
THAN ELI JAMES.

30:54.984 --> 30:56.986
COME UP HERE, ELI.

31:14.273 --> 31:15.474
I THOUGHT WE HAD A DEAL.

31:15.474 --> 31:16.645
SO DID I,

31:16.645 --> 31:18.147
UNTIL I OVERHEARD
VICTORIA'S LITTLE SIDEKICK

31:18.147 --> 31:19.949

BUT WITH YOU HANDING OUT
$100,000 CHECKS,

31:25.114 --> 31:26.986
IT'S OBVIOUS THAT
THERE'S MORE TO THE STORY

31:26.986 --> 31:28.457
THAN YOU'RE TELLING ME,
AND...

31:28.457 --> 31:30.319
NOW YOU'VE GOT ME CURIOUS.

31:50.980 --> 31:52.311
I WANTED TO INTRODUCE YOU

THE SAME THING
THAT I'M ABOUT TO TELL YOU.

32:31.050 --> 32:33.052
AS MUCH AS I'D LIKE
TO TAKE CREDIT

32:33.052 --> 32:35.985
FOR SAVING YOUR LIFE
THE OTHER NIGHT,

32:35.985 --> 32:38.327
THAT'S NOT WHAT HAPPENED
OUT THERE.

32:43.292 --> 32:45.534
WHAT IS THIS?

A COPY

32:47.496 --> 32:50.969
OF THE TITLE TO THE SPEEDBOAT

32:50.969 --> 32:53.102
FORMERLY KNOWN
AS "THE ROSE GRAY."

THAT BOAT?

33:04.053 --> 33:07.716
WELL, THAT'S WHAT
THE STATE RECORD SAYS.

33:07.716 --> 33:09.358
I MEAN, I GUESS IT MAKES SENSE,

33:09.358 --> 33:11.760
CONSIDERING NO ONE CAME FORWARD
TO SAY THEY SAVED YOUR LIFE.

33:11.760 --> 33:13.462
WOULDN'T BE THE FIRST TIME

33:13.462 --> 33:15.564
THAT THE RYAN BROTHERS
TEAMED UP AGAINST YOU.

34:29.098 --> 34:31.069
THIS NOOSE TIGHTENING
AROUND MY NECK.

34:31.069 --> 34:34.143
I CAN HARDLY BREATHE,

AROUND SOMEONE ELSE'S.

34:36.844 --> 34:38.407
WELL...

MAYBE THAT'S WHAT
YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO DO.

34:41.079 --> 34:42.380
EVEN IF IT MEANS
THAT PERSON

34:42.380 --> 34:44.753
WILL SUFFER THE FATE
THAT THEY HAD PLANNED FOR ME?

34:46.155 --> 34:48.857
(sighs) ALL I CARE ABOUT
IS YOU.

34:48.857 --> 34:50.759
DO YOUR PARENTS KNOW
ABOUT THIS?

34:50.759 --> 34:52.460
KNOW ABOUT THIS?

34:52.460 --> 34:54.793
THAT'S THE WHOLE REASON
FOR THIS PARTY TONIGHT.

34:54.793 --> 34:56.795
THEY'RE HIDING THEIR MONEY
IN THIS FOUNDATION

34:56.795 --> 34:58.667
IN CASE
THERE'S AN INVESTIGATION

34:58.667 --> 35:01.130

35:01.130 --> 35:02.531
ARE YOU KIDDING ME?

35:02.531 --> 35:04.773
NO.

I SHOULD CANCEL MY CHECK.

NO, DON'T, PLEASE.

35:08.137 --> 35:10.139
THEY'LL SUSPECT

35:35.564 --> 35:38.136
$100,000.

35:38.136 --> 35:38.907
THE QUESTION IS,

35:38.907 --> 35:41.240
WHAT IS IT
HE'S EXPECTING TO BUY?

35:41.240 --> 35:43.242
MM.
DID WE RAISE ENOUGH MONEY

35:43.242 --> 35:44.873
TO FORM
A LEGITIMATE CHARITY?

35:44.873 --> 35:47.176
JUST SHY OF $5 MILLION.

35:47.176 --> 35:49.918
NO ONE CAN ACCUSE YOU OF BEING
AN UNDERACHIEVER, MY DEAR.

AIDEN MATHIS BY FRIDAY.

36:03.292 --> 36:04.633
OH.

36:04.633 --> 36:05.934
MIGHT RAISE A RED FLAG

36:05.934 --> 36:08.667
IF I DIDN'T SUPPORT
OUR OWN CAUSE.

36:08.667 --> 36:11.900
MAKE SURE THE TREASURER
KNOWS IT'S TAX-DEDUCTIBLE.

36:14.172 --> 36:16.275
WELL, THANK GOD
HE'S FOUND THE FORTITUDE

36:16.275 --> 36:17.846
TO GET THROUGH THIS.

36:17.846 --> 36:19.848
I HAVE A PRETTY GOOD IDEA
WHERE HE GOT IT.

36:19.848 --> 36:22.381
IT SEEMS HE'S BEEN COZYING UP
TO EMILY THORNE THIS EVENING.

36:22.381 --> 36:24.383
IF HE IS COZYING UP
TO SOMEONE,

36:24.383 --> 36:26.955
YOU CAN BET
TRASK WILL KNOW ABOUT IT.

36:26.955 --> 36:31.220

SOLVE ONE OF OUR PROBLEMS.

36:37.626 --> 36:38.767
I HAVE HIM CONVINCED

36:38.767 --> 36:40.969
THAT KENNY RYAN
BOUGHT THAT SPEEDBOAT.

36:40.969 --> 36:42.631
GOOD.

36:42.631 --> 36:44.773
LISTEN, YOU SAID THAT CARRION
CAN OVERTAKE ANY HOST COMPUTER.

36:44.773 --> 36:46.375
IS THAT TRUE?

36:46.375 --> 36:48.807
Oh, it's never met a firewall
it couldn't level in seconds,

36:48.807 --> 36:50.739
WITHOUT A TRACE.
(chuckles)

36:50.739 --> 36:52.411
IT'S MARVELOUS, REALLY.

36:52.411 --> 36:53.982
BUT, UH,
I KNOW YOU DIDN'T CALL

36:53.982 --> 36:55.844
TO SWEET-TALK TECHNOLOGY.

36:55.844 --> 36:57.846
THE GRAYSONS ARE PLANNING
TO MOVE THEIR ENTIRE FORTUNE

36:57.846 --> 37:00.218
INTO
THE AMANDA CLARKE FOUNDATION.

37:00.218 --> 37:01.550
IF WE CAN

37:01.550 --> 37:02.891
access that account,
then we could--

37:02.891 --> 37:04.953
BANKRUPT THE GRAYSONS.

37:04.953 --> 37:08.857
(huffs) THAT IS QUITE
AN ACHILLES YOU'VE DISCOVERED.

37:08.857 --> 37:11.900
AND TOMORROW WE SEVER IT.

37:19.268 --> 37:22.671
(birds chirping)

37:22.671 --> 37:24.313
SO HOW DO I LOOK?

37:24.313 --> 37:25.974
LIKE SOMEONE ABOUT TO GO TO
A BOARD INDUCTION, HOPEFULLY?

37:25.974 --> 37:27.976
I WOULD SAY THAT YOU
LOOK THE PART

37:27.976 --> 37:30.419
OF BOTH BOARD MEMBER
OF A CORRUPT COMPANY

37:30.419 --> 37:33.021
AND TREASURER
FOR A BOGUS CHARITY.

37:33.021 --> 37:35.023
(chuckles) WELL, THE LATTER
POSITION MAY NOT LAST TOO LONG,

37:35.023 --> 37:37.826
AS CONRAD HAS ME AS TREASURER
OF A SWISS ACCOUNT

37:37.826 --> 37:40.829
FOR WHICH I SEEM TO HAVE LOST
THE ROUTING INFORMATION.

37:40.829 --> 37:43.662
OH, HERE. I BORROWED IT
FOR NOLAN. SORRY.

37:43.662 --> 37:45.564
THANK YOU.

37:45.564 --> 37:47.636
SO I TAKE IT THE GRAYSONS

37:47.636 --> 37:50.399
ARE WELL ON THE ROAD
TOWARDS POVERTY?

37:50.399 --> 37:51.900
ASSUMING
THAT NOLAN'S SOFTWARE

37:51.900 --> 37:53.642
WORKS AS WELL
AS HE CLAIMS IT DOES.
 (clicks latches)

37:53.642 --> 37:55.544
RIGHT.

37:55.544 --> 37:58.377
SO WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO
ABOUT ELI?

37:58.377 --> 37:59.848
NOTHING FOR NOW.

37:59.848 --> 38:01.750
IF HE EXPOSES ME,
HE'D JEOPARDIZE

38:01.750 --> 38:03.682
EVERYTHING HE STANDS
TO GAIN HERE.

38:03.682 --> 38:04.883
HE WOULDN'T DO THAT.

38:04.883 --> 38:06.355
LOOK, I DON'T KNOW
IF THIS HAS TO DO WITH GUILT

38:06.355 --> 38:07.686
ABOUT THAT CHILDHOOD FIRE
OR AMANDA OR--

38:07.686 --> 38:08.817
IT HAS NOTHING TO DO
WITH AMANDA.

38:08.817 --> 38:10.359
WELL, WHATEVER IT IS,

38:10.359 --> 38:11.860
I DON'T LIKE SEEING YOU
PUT YOURSELF AT RISK

38:11.860 --> 38:13.862
FOR A PERSON WHO YOU OWE
NO ALLEGIANCE TO WHATSOEVER.

38:13.862 --> 38:14.963
I DO OWE HIM.

38:14.963 --> 38:16.765
BUT I UNDERSTAND
THAT HE'S A LIABILITY.

38:16.765 --> 38:18.597
I JUST NEED TO FIGURE OUT
HOW TO GET HIM TO LEAVE

38:18.597 --> 38:20.569
WITHOUT CAUSING
ANY MORE HARM.

38:20.569 --> 38:21.730
OKAY.

38:23.372 --> 38:24.873
MM.

38:24.873 --> 38:28.437
SO... THIS IS WHERE
AIDEN-SAN "WAXES OFF."

38:28.437 --> 38:30.038
HUH. (clicks tongue)

38:30.038 --> 38:32.681
MAKE YOURSELF AT HOME.

38:32.681 --> 38:34.713
SEE YOU LATER.
 BYE.

38:38.487 --> 38:40.318
(Daniel)
THERE'S BEEN MUCH SPECULATION

38:40.318 --> 38:42.391
AS TO WHO WOULD FILL MY FATHER'S
EMPTY SEAT ON THE BOARD,

38:42.391 --> 38:44.453
AND, WELL...

38:44.453 --> 38:47.456
I'M THRILLED TO ANNOUNCE
THE VICTOR.

38:47.456 --> 38:49.758
AIDEN MATHIS.

38:49.758 --> 38:54.363
HE'S NOT ONLY CAPABLE
OF HELPING STEER THIS COMPANY,

38:54.363 --> 38:56.365
BUT HE'S GOT YOUR BACK
IN BAR FIGHT, TOO.

38:56.365 --> 38:57.866
(laughter)

38:57.866 --> 38:59.908
AN ALL-AROUND GOOD BLOKE.

38:59.908 --> 39:01.540
WELCOME ABOARD.

39:01.540 --> 39:04.373
THANK YOU, MR. GRAYSON.
 GOOD JOB.

39:04.373 --> 39:05.874
(Emily) SO YOU'RE CERTAIN
THAT CARRION

39:05.874 --> 39:07.816
CAN ACCESS THE ACCOUNT
WITHOUT SETTING OFF ALARMS?
 (whirs)

39:07.816 --> 39:10.078
SHE'S A SILENT KILLER.

39:10.078 --> 39:12.350
WHY DO YOU THINK
I'M SO ANXIOUS

39:12.350 --> 39:14.883
ABOUT WHO GETS THEIR HANDS
ON HER?

39:14.883 --> 39:18.126
WATCH AND BE AMAZED.

39:18.126 --> 39:21.630
SUPER SUB-NET FIREWALL...
 (beeps)

39:21.630 --> 39:22.891
DEMOLISHED.

39:22.891 --> 39:26.364
OOH, DUAL-HOMED GATEWAY...

39:26.364 --> 39:28.597
CRUSHED.

39:28.597 --> 39:31.400
ROTATING INTEGRATED
MATRIX--

39:31.400 --> 39:33.742
IMPRESSIVE AND YET...

39:33.742 --> 39:35.844
(beeps)

39:35.844 --> 39:36.845
(error beeps sound)
 MM.

39:36.845 --> 39:37.806
(clicks keyboard keys)

39:37.806 --> 39:39.578
WAIT. IT STOPPED.
WHAT HAPPENED?

39:39.578 --> 39:41.780
(error beeps sound)
 WAIT. LET ME ACCESS
THE MAINFRAME'S CODE,

39:41.780 --> 39:44.953
SEE WHAT'S TRIPPING US UP.

39:44.953 --> 39:47.756
(electrical whirring)

39:47.756 --> 39:49.688
THIS CAN'T BE.

39:51.920 --> 39:54.923
WHAT? WHAT IS IT?

39:54.923 --> 39:56.795
(inhales deeply)

39:56.795 --> 39:58.467
EMS...

39:58.467 --> 40:01.169
I'VE SEEN THIS BEFORE.

40:01.169 --> 40:03.001
ALL THE FORENSIC EVIDENCE,

40:03.001 --> 40:05.874
YOUR E-MAILS,
THE ACCOUNT TRANSFERS--

40:05.874 --> 40:07.776
EVERYTHING THAT THE GRAYSONS
HAD DOCTORED

40:07.776 --> 40:08.907
TO HAVE YOU PUT AWAY

40:08.907 --> 40:10.439
WAS DONE
BY SOMEONE ON THE PAYROLL.

40:10.439 --> 40:11.910
WELL, AT FIRST
I DIDN'T KNOW WHO

40:11.910 --> 40:14.813
UNTIL I STARTED SEARCHING
THE LOG FILES.

40:14.813 --> 40:16.915
"THE FALCON."

40:16.915 --> 40:18.987
HE'S A HACKER LEGEND.

40:18.987 --> 40:21.490
AT ONE POINT,
I ASPIRED TO BE HIM.

40:21.490 --> 40:22.821
HIS ONLY FLAW--HIS EGO.

40:22.821 --> 40:24.793
HE LEAVES HIS NAME
IN EVERYTHING THAT HE CODES--

40:24.793 --> 40:25.954
ENOUGH, NOLAN.

40:25.954 --> 40:28.457
NO, LOOK, THE GRAYSONS
PAID A LOT OF PEOPLE

40:28.457 --> 40:29.758
FOR A LOT OF LIES.

40:29.758 --> 40:31.700
BUT THIS IS THE ONE PERSON

40:31.700 --> 40:32.831
THEY COULD NOT
 HAVE FRAMED YOU WITHOUT.

40:32.831 --> 40:35.133
IF I CAN JUST--
 ENOUGH!

40:35.133 --> 40:37.866
LISTEN, I APPRECIATE
EVERYTHING THAT YOU'RE DOING.

40:37.866 --> 40:39.868
BUT I CAN'T WASTE MY TIME
FIGHTING ANYMORE.

40:39.868 --> 40:41.439
BUT, DAVID,

40:41.439 --> 40:43.942
THIS IS THE LEAD THAT
WE HAVE BEEN SEARCHING FOR.

40:43.942 --> 40:46.014
AMANDA--
SHE SET ANOTHER FIRE.

40:46.014 --> 40:47.946
IT'S WORSE
THAN THE LAST ONE.

40:47.946 --> 40:50.118
SHE'S LOOKING AT LEAST
THREE YEARS IN JUVIE.

40:50.118 --> 40:52.851
YOU NEED TO FORGET ABOUT ME
AND FOCUS ON HER.

40:52.851 --> 40:54.823
SHE'S THE ONLY THING
THAT MATTERS ANYMORE.

40:54.823 --> 40:57.986
YOU CAN'T LET HER END UP
IN A PLACE LIKE THIS, NOLAN.

40:57.986 --> 41:00.589
(cuffs scrape tabletop)

41:02.460 --> 41:05.734
WHEN SHE'S READY...

41:05.734 --> 41:08.767
I WANT YOU TO MAKE SURE
THAT SHE GETS THIS.

41:08.767 --> 41:10.699
IT'S HER FUTURE.

41:12.541 --> 41:14.803
I AM TRUSTING YOU

41:14.803 --> 41:16.605
TO MAKE SURE THAT SHE LIVES
LONG ENOUGH

41:16.605 --> 41:18.146
TO HAVE A FUTURE, NOLAN.

41:22.080 --> 41:23.982
(sighs)

41:23.982 --> 41:25.784
WHOEVER WROTE THE CODE

41:25.784 --> 41:28.256
PROTECTING
THIS BANK ACCOUNT...

41:29.758 --> 41:33.522
IS THE SAME PERSON THAT
SEALED YOUR FATHER'S FATE.

41:37.025 --> 41:40.028
THE MAN, THE MYTH--

41:40.028 --> 41:45.103
THE FALCON IS BACK
ON THE GRAYSONS' PAYROLL.

41:46.875 --> 41:48.837
THEN LET'S GO HUNTING.
