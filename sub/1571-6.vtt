(Brian and Stewie scream)

00:38.972 --> 00:41.306
Hurry, Brian,
they're gaining on us!

00:43.910 --> 00:45.611
(gunfire)

00:47.647 --> 00:49.148
Damn it,
we're surrounded!

00:55.088 --> 00:56.755
Crap, they got away.

00:56.757 --> 00:58.323
Better call the boss.

00:59.893 --> 01:02.861
Damn, I'm not getting
a smoke signal here.

01:02.863 --> 01:03.862
(plays rim shot)

01:03.864 --> 01:05.431
(rainstick rattles)

01:12.939 --> 01:14.907
Damn it, Stewie, what
the hell did you do?!

01:14.909 --> 01:16.408
I know, I know,
I messed up.

01:16.410 --> 01:17.576
(mocks):
"I messed up."

01:17.578 --> 01:18.877
You went back
to 17th-century Jamestown

01:18.879 --> 01:20.412
and you gave guns
to the Indians.

01:20.414 --> 01:21.580
And now they're
running everything!

01:21.582 --> 01:23.282
I said I messed up,
all right?!

01:23.284 --> 01:24.616
I guess I just have

01:24.618 --> 01:26.051
this pathological need
to be liked.

01:26.053 --> 01:27.419
Well, it's not
a good trait.

01:27.421 --> 01:28.787
Aw, come on.
Don't say that.

01:28.789 --> 01:30.289
Let me buy you lunch.

01:30.291 --> 01:32.624
Thanks to you, the Indians
killed all the white people

01:32.626 --> 01:33.892
and took over America.

01:33.894 --> 01:35.761
I mean, you're the one
who's always saying,

01:35.763 --> 01:37.029
"Never alter the past."

01:37.031 --> 01:38.530
Oh, come on, Brian,
let's be honest.

01:38.532 --> 01:39.932
I frequently alter
the past.

01:39.934 --> 01:43.535
All right, so, I guess
we'll split the bill 13 ways?

01:43.537 --> 01:46.438
Hey, Judas, he ordered,
like, five margaritas.

01:46.440 --> 01:49.108
All you had
was a salad.

01:58.084 --> 01:59.451
You know, it actually
looks like

01:59.453 --> 02:01.587
the Native Americans have
done all right for themselves.

02:01.589 --> 02:03.655
They do seem to have
a lot of shops.

02:09.929 --> 02:12.664
And it looks like they have
medical care as well.

02:12.666 --> 02:15.267
Ma'am, I'm sorry,
but I've done this

02:15.269 --> 02:18.237
several times today, and your
husband just isn't responding.

02:18.239 --> 02:19.938
Well, have you
tried this?

02:19.940 --> 02:22.007
Ma'am, this is a place
of medicine.

02:22.009 --> 02:24.276
And their popular music
is interesting.

02:24.278 --> 02:26.478
And here it is,
the number one song

02:26.480 --> 02:28.914
for the 10,000th week in a row,

02:28.916 --> 02:31.083
"Huya-Huya-Huya"!

02:31.085 --> 02:33.685
(chanting):
♪ Huya-Huya-Huya-Huya

02:33.687 --> 02:36.622
♪ Huya-Huya-Huya-Huya...

02:36.624 --> 02:37.789
Well, no matter.

02:37.791 --> 02:39.591
We better restore things
to the way they were.

02:39.593 --> 02:41.160
Let's go back to Jamestown
and undo...

02:41.162 --> 02:42.928
Oh, dear.
What? What is it?

02:42.930 --> 02:44.062
The return pad.

02:45.532 --> 02:47.833
Looks like it took some
bullets during our escape.

02:47.835 --> 02:49.601
Doesn't seem
to be working.

02:49.603 --> 02:50.602
Hmm.

02:50.604 --> 02:51.937
What?
Wha-What is that?

02:51.939 --> 02:53.105
What is that, "Hmm"?

02:53.107 --> 02:54.540
Wha-What are
you looking for?

02:54.542 --> 02:56.441
What are you looking
for specifically?

02:56.443 --> 02:57.476
Yeah, that's right.

02:57.478 --> 02:59.044
But I'm afraid
our only hope

02:59.046 --> 03:00.479
is that perhaps
the alternate Stewie

03:00.481 --> 03:01.713
in this universe
has created

03:01.715 --> 03:03.515
his own time machine
that we can use.

03:03.517 --> 03:04.616
Well, let's hope so,

03:04.618 --> 03:06.118
because otherwise
they're gonna kill us.

03:06.120 --> 03:07.452
Yeah, or stick us on

03:07.454 --> 03:08.887
some kind of white
people reservation.

03:10.623 --> 03:12.157
Don't give them
any money.

03:12.159 --> 03:14.626
They're just gonna spend
it all on deviled eggs.

03:22.302 --> 03:24.970
Well, there's my brave warrior.

03:24.972 --> 03:26.305
How was work today?

03:26.307 --> 03:27.472
Oh, it was so annoying.

03:27.474 --> 03:29.041
Everyone was coming around
with their daughters,

03:29.043 --> 03:30.242
selling Girl Scout corn.

03:30.244 --> 03:33.078
Made me feel so guilty,
I had to buy, like, 20 ears.

03:33.080 --> 03:36.481
Hey, shot in the dark, but,
uh, is anyone else in the mood

03:36.483 --> 03:38.483
to run really fast
in one direction?

03:41.221 --> 03:43.355
Look, there it is!

03:43.357 --> 03:45.591
And it looks like he has
a return pad, too.

03:45.593 --> 03:46.992
All right, come on.

03:46.994 --> 03:50.095
Let's get back to Jamestown
and set things right.

03:50.097 --> 03:52.164
(zapping, whirring)

03:57.737 --> 04:00.138
Look, there you are
giving them the guns!

04:04.677 --> 04:06.078
What the hell
are you doing there?

04:06.080 --> 04:07.913
You told me you were
checking on the horses.

04:07.915 --> 04:09.047
Well, she's a
sizeable woman.

04:09.049 --> 04:10.115
That's what I meant.

04:15.588 --> 04:16.622
All right, come on.

04:16.624 --> 04:17.923
We've got to get
those guns back.

04:17.925 --> 04:19.591
Hey, hi,
how are you today?

04:19.593 --> 04:21.026
Good to see you.

04:21.028 --> 04:22.561
Listen, uh, we've
just been informed

04:22.563 --> 04:24.029
that these guns
are defective.

04:24.031 --> 04:25.964
Uh, we're from
the gun company.

04:25.966 --> 04:27.432
Um, anyway, you know how

04:27.434 --> 04:29.868
we like to take things back
from you people?

04:29.870 --> 04:32.104
Well, we're gonna go ahead
and take these back.

04:32.106 --> 04:33.472
That's right.
We're from GunCo.

04:33.474 --> 04:34.940
(hushed): Shut up,
you're blowing it.

04:34.942 --> 04:36.908
Where you taking guns?

04:36.910 --> 04:39.611
Brian, grab
the return pad!

04:39.613 --> 04:41.980
Get 'um paleface!

04:43.816 --> 04:46.818
They're gone.
We can talk normal now.

04:51.090 --> 04:52.824
Well, everything looks
like it should.

04:52.826 --> 04:54.760
Only one way
to be certain.

04:54.762 --> 04:56.762
Okay, let's do
a quick search here.

04:56.764 --> 04:58.430
"Native American
role models."

04:58.432 --> 04:59.464
"Zero results found."

04:59.466 --> 05:01.066
Looks like we did it, Brian.

05:01.068 --> 05:02.334
Ah, thank God!

05:02.336 --> 05:04.569
Hey, what are you gonna do
with all those guns?

05:04.571 --> 05:07.005
I don't know, sell 'em
to some messed up kid?

05:10.576 --> 05:11.777
(metallic banging)

05:11.779 --> 05:13.312
What the hell is that?

05:13.314 --> 05:14.813
Stewie?

05:19.252 --> 05:20.852
Oh, my God!
What are you doing?!

05:20.854 --> 05:23.522
This time machine has
almost killed us

05:23.524 --> 05:24.756
a hundred times, Brian.

05:24.758 --> 05:26.692
And yesterday was
just too close a call.

05:26.694 --> 05:28.593
So I've decided
to get rid of it

05:28.595 --> 05:30.262
before something
irreparable happens.

05:30.264 --> 05:32.097
But, Stewie,
your-your time machine,

05:32.099 --> 05:33.432
it's, like, your crowning
achievement.

05:33.434 --> 05:35.100
I-I can't believe
you'd just destroy it.

05:35.102 --> 05:36.635
Trust me, Brian,
it's for the best.

05:36.637 --> 05:38.937
And, hey, at least I've
had some fun with it.

05:38.939 --> 05:40.772
Do you know what
I did last week?

05:40.774 --> 05:42.107
I time-traveled
ahead to Christmas

05:42.109 --> 05:43.942
so I wouldn't have
to wait all year

05:43.944 --> 05:45.544
for the new toys
to come out.

05:45.546 --> 05:47.479
Wow, good timing,
little fella.

05:47.481 --> 05:49.114
This just came out today.

05:49.116 --> 05:50.849
(chuckles) Yeah, I kind
of knew that already.

05:50.851 --> 05:52.651
Would you like to donate
an extra dollar

05:52.653 --> 05:53.885
to the Quahog Food Bank?

05:53.887 --> 05:55.287
Oh, sure.

05:55.289 --> 05:57.689
And would you like to come
home and clean my toilet,

05:57.691 --> 05:59.591
while we're both doing
stuff for each other?

06:11.237 --> 06:13.372
(sighs)
Well, I guess that's it.

06:13.374 --> 06:15.340
This is, like,
the end of an era.

06:15.342 --> 06:16.875
Oh, sack up, you twink.

06:16.877 --> 06:18.243
It's just a machine.

06:18.245 --> 06:19.978
God, look at all
the perfectly good stuff

06:19.980 --> 06:21.747
that people just throw out
for no reason.

06:21.749 --> 06:23.248
I don't know.
It's mostly twin mattresses.

06:23.250 --> 06:24.649
If you have
a twin mattress,

06:24.651 --> 06:26.818
aren't you pretty much
a failure as a human being?

06:26.820 --> 06:27.919
No, I mean it.

06:27.921 --> 06:29.521
Like, here, look at this
street hockey net.

06:29.523 --> 06:30.689
It's in great shape.

06:30.691 --> 06:32.924
You know, we should take this
home and set it up.

06:32.926 --> 06:34.359
Get some fresh air,
get some exercise.

06:34.361 --> 06:36.228
Well, I suppose I could
use a new hobby

06:36.230 --> 06:37.729
now that the time
machine is gone.

06:37.731 --> 06:39.398
You sure you're
not gonna miss that thing?

06:39.400 --> 06:41.032
Nah, I was getting
bored of it anyway.

06:41.034 --> 06:42.234
You know, not every
historical event

06:42.236 --> 06:43.935
is all it's
cracked up to be.

06:43.937 --> 06:45.871
Women, we've spent
decades fighting

06:45.873 --> 06:47.406
for our right to vote.

06:47.408 --> 06:50.709
So, when you go to those
booths and cast your ballot,

06:50.711 --> 06:54.513
remember, Warren G. Harding
is way the cutest!

06:54.515 --> 06:55.914

06:55.916 --> 07:00.685
♪ Oh, girls just
want to have fun... ♪

07:02.555 --> 07:04.589
Okay, Brian, I'm just
putting this out there,

07:04.591 --> 07:05.757
but I'm a baby,

07:05.759 --> 07:08.093
and only dicks
don't let babies win.

07:08.095 --> 07:09.594
God, look at
this day, huh?

07:09.596 --> 07:11.596
You know, usually, I'd be
sitting inside writing,

07:11.598 --> 07:13.365
you'd be working on one
of your machines.

07:13.367 --> 07:15.100
But here we are
enjoying it.

07:15.102 --> 07:17.068
Yes, it is a nice change
of pace.

07:17.070 --> 07:19.237
Oh, wait, I got to go
grab my knee pads.

07:19.239 --> 07:21.406
I was using them for...
for-for this other thing.

07:21.408 --> 07:23.108
Anyway,
I'll be right back.

07:24.076 --> 07:27.078
(tires squeal)

07:27.080 --> 07:28.447
Brian, look out!

07:32.752 --> 07:34.486
Ah, Brian!

07:34.488 --> 07:36.455
Oh, my God!

07:37.390 --> 07:39.891
Brian! Brian, can you hear me?!

07:39.893 --> 07:42.994
Holy crap!
What the hell happened?!

07:42.996 --> 07:45.130
That guy sucked.

07:52.271 --> 07:54.940
Mom, is Brian gonna be okay?

07:54.942 --> 07:56.274
I don't know, Meg.

07:56.276 --> 07:58.610
But this is the best
veterinarian in Quahog.

07:58.612 --> 08:00.812
Brian's getting
the finest care there is.

08:00.814 --> 08:03.181
He had to share the ambulance
with a chicken.

08:03.183 --> 08:06.284
Um, aren't you supposed
to be running around?

08:06.286 --> 08:07.652
Don't talk to me.

08:07.654 --> 08:10.422
You have a bad reputation
in the chicken community.

08:10.424 --> 08:11.923
Doctor, how is Brian?

08:11.925 --> 08:13.425
Is he gonna be okay?

08:13.427 --> 08:16.161
I'm so sorry, Mrs. Griffin,
but Brian's injuries

08:16.163 --> 08:18.497
are just too severe
for us to save him.

08:18.499 --> 08:20.599
I don't know
how much longer he has,

08:20.601 --> 08:23.401
but I suggest that you all go in
and say your good-byes.

08:34.013 --> 08:36.081
(monitor beeping steadily)

08:39.018 --> 08:40.785
Oh, my God!

08:40.787 --> 08:41.987
Brian, no!

08:41.989 --> 08:43.488
I can't believe it.

08:43.490 --> 08:45.156
Y-You're really...

08:45.158 --> 08:46.958
Damn it, Brian,
you can't die!

08:46.960 --> 08:49.060
We were gonna do
so many things together.

08:49.062 --> 08:50.328
We were gonna become
windsurfers.

08:50.330 --> 08:52.564
I was gonna be
a little better than you,

08:52.566 --> 08:54.065
but we were both
gonna be good!

08:54.067 --> 08:55.567
(groans softly)

08:55.569 --> 08:57.302
You guys,
I think, I think

08:57.304 --> 08:59.070
Brian's trying
to say something!

08:59.072 --> 09:04.175
You... you've given me
a wonderful life.

09:04.177 --> 09:06.111
I love you all.

09:09.582 --> 09:11.216
(monitor flatlines)

09:13.419 --> 09:16.187

Yes, Chris, I'm afraid...

09:21.728 --> 09:24.729
I'm afraid that
our Brian is dead!

09:53.593 --> 09:56.595
Guys, I'm gonna need a few
minutes alone upstairs.

09:56.597 --> 10:00.131
I got to do, like,
a-a sad yank.

10:00.133 --> 10:02.233
Stupid street hockey.

10:02.235 --> 10:04.302
I wish we never went
to that dump.

10:04.304 --> 10:05.870
Oh, this is all my fault.

10:05.872 --> 10:08.640
I'm the one who had to throw
away the damn time machine.

10:08.642 --> 10:10.075
Wait a minute. That's it!

10:10.077 --> 10:12.243
I've just got to rebuild
the time machine,

10:12.245 --> 10:14.446
and then I can go back
and save Brian!

10:15.715 --> 10:17.616
(tires screech)

10:17.618 --> 10:20.051
Oh, happy birthday, Neil!

10:23.456 --> 10:25.256
Stewie! How are you?

10:25.258 --> 10:27.959
Oh, not well, Yusuf.
I need your help.

10:27.961 --> 10:30.128
I have to track down
a titanium capacitor

10:30.130 --> 10:32.430
for a high-wattage mainframe
I'm going to construct.

10:32.432 --> 10:33.598
Titanium capacitors?

10:33.600 --> 10:35.667
Sorry, there's no way
to get those anymore.

10:35.669 --> 10:36.801
What do you mean?

10:36.803 --> 10:38.503
You've gotten them
for me before.

10:38.505 --> 10:42.107
I know, but the one guy who made
those drew a doodle of Mohammed,

10:42.109 --> 10:43.942
so he's not around anymore.

10:43.944 --> 10:45.944
He wasn't even doing it
on purpose,

10:45.946 --> 10:48.079
just absentmindedly
while talking on the phone.

10:48.081 --> 10:50.081
But it was Mohammed, so...

10:50.083 --> 10:51.282
you know.

10:51.284 --> 10:52.283
Oh, that's awful.

10:52.285 --> 10:54.753
Okay, Yusuf,
thanks, anyway.

10:54.755 --> 10:56.588
Oh, dear, Rupert,
without those capacitors,

10:56.590 --> 10:58.356
it'll be completely impossible

10:58.358 --> 11:00.091
to build
a functioning time machine.

11:00.093 --> 11:01.192
(sighs)

11:01.194 --> 11:05.030
I guess that means Brian
is really gone for good.

11:08.000 --> 11:10.068
(sobbing)

11:12.605 --> 11:14.472
Thank you so much
for coming, guys.

11:14.474 --> 11:16.608
Brian would be very
thankful that you're here.

11:16.610 --> 11:17.776
No problem, Lois.

11:17.778 --> 11:19.444
You know, I usually
don't come to funerals.

11:19.446 --> 11:20.779
Since I'm a cop,

11:20.781 --> 11:23.481
I always wind up getting hit
by a black woman with a purse.

11:23.483 --> 11:25.350
You find the man
who did this.

11:25.352 --> 11:27.552
Uh, ma'am, what's your
relationship to Brian?
You bring him to justice!

11:27.554 --> 11:29.320
You make sure this angel child
didn't die for nothing!

11:29.322 --> 11:31.122
Are you sure you're at
the right funeral?

11:31.124 --> 11:33.725
Ma'am, Brian's a dog.
You show the world
why you became a cop!

11:33.727 --> 11:35.393
Okay.

11:37.363 --> 11:40.131
Thank you, everyone,
for coming today.

11:40.133 --> 11:42.801
None of you people came
to my funeral!

11:45.237 --> 11:48.740
I know Peter wanted
to say a few words.

11:48.742 --> 11:49.908
(sighs)

11:49.910 --> 11:52.243
Oh, boy, this is, um...

11:52.245 --> 11:55.480
this is probably the worst pain
I've ever had to go through,

11:55.482 --> 11:58.149
and I've sprained
my ankle twice.

11:58.151 --> 12:00.552
Um... the truth is,

12:00.554 --> 12:02.387
Brian wasn't just my dog.

12:02.389 --> 12:05.090
He was my best friend
in the whole world.

12:05.092 --> 12:07.759
He was smart, he was loyal,

12:07.761 --> 12:10.929
and I guess what
I'm trying to say is

12:10.931 --> 12:13.198
he was like a brother to me.

12:13.200 --> 12:15.400
(voice breaking):
And I-I'm gonna spend

12:15.402 --> 12:17.569
the rest of my life missing him.

12:17.571 --> 12:19.204
(sniffling)

12:19.206 --> 12:21.172
We're all gonna
miss him, Peter.

12:21.174 --> 12:24.042
We're all gonna miss him
very much.

12:24.044 --> 12:26.111
(crying)

12:27.079 --> 12:28.279
Damn it, Ortiz.

12:28.281 --> 12:30.348
Stop swinging at junk.

12:58.978 --> 13:01.446
My God, I almost served
Brian again.

13:01.448 --> 13:04.149
I can't believe he's been gone
a whole month.

13:04.151 --> 13:06.050
Can we at least get rid
of the doggie door

13:06.052 --> 13:07.819
so Chris doesn't keep
getting stuck in it?

13:07.821 --> 13:10.588
Every day I get
a little further in.

13:10.590 --> 13:12.157
You know, I hate to say it,

13:12.159 --> 13:13.925
but I-I'm starting to think
the only way

13:13.927 --> 13:16.795
to stop missing Brian
is to get a new dog.

13:16.797 --> 13:19.597
Or do we all get
Ghostbuster jumpsuits

13:19.599 --> 13:20.765
with our names on them?

13:20.767 --> 13:22.433
♪ Who you gonna call?

13:22.435 --> 13:24.302
♪ The Griffins.

13:24.304 --> 13:25.637
I'm serious, Peter.

13:25.639 --> 13:27.939
I know it might take time
to find the right dog,

13:27.941 --> 13:29.841
but I really feel like
it might be

13:29.843 --> 13:31.743
the best way for us
to move on.

13:31.745 --> 13:33.178
Yeah, Dad.
That would be nice.

13:33.180 --> 13:35.780
All right, well, I guess
it couldn't hurt to look.

13:35.782 --> 13:37.248
Really? Another dog?

13:37.250 --> 13:39.117
Look, I miss Brian
more than any of you,

13:39.119 --> 13:40.819
but at least now
no one's forcing us

13:40.821 --> 13:43.354
to watch
those awful PBS documentaries.

13:43.356 --> 13:47.091
ANNOUNCER: <i>And now PBS presents</i>
<i>Albino Children Are Normal.</i>

13:47.093 --> 13:50.595
So, with the exception of not
being able to go out in the sun,

13:50.597 --> 13:51.863
you're completely normal?

13:51.865 --> 13:53.932
Yes. The moon is my sun.

13:53.934 --> 13:55.600
I like to kill beetles.

13:55.602 --> 13:57.368
Beetles are teachers.

13:57.370 --> 13:59.838
I sleep with a fork.

14:02.875 --> 14:05.476
(birds singing, dogs barking)

14:05.478 --> 14:08.446
All right, guys, time to
find a new family dog.

14:08.448 --> 14:10.014
Hey, Chris,
you're kind of a creep.

14:10.016 --> 14:11.182
You should get a ferret.

14:11.184 --> 14:12.951
You're right, I am.

14:12.953 --> 14:14.285
And I will!

14:14.287 --> 14:15.620
(dogs barking)

14:15.622 --> 14:18.289
I don't know how to choose
between all these dogs.

14:18.291 --> 14:19.724
(New Jersey accent):
Hey, you, green pants.

14:19.726 --> 14:21.960
I hear you're looking for a dog
or something.

14:21.962 --> 14:24.462
Oh, finally, someone who sounds
like they went to college.

14:24.464 --> 14:26.064
Hi, I'm Peter.
Vinny.

14:26.066 --> 14:27.699
Oh, Vinny, like the Pooh.

14:27.701 --> 14:29.067
Hey, that's kind of cool.

14:29.069 --> 14:30.201
So, what's your story?

14:30.203 --> 14:31.870
Well, you know,
I'm just a regular guy.

14:31.872 --> 14:33.738
You throw a stick,
maybe I bring it back.

14:33.740 --> 14:36.841
Maybe I bring back
an iPhone that fell off a truck.

14:36.843 --> 14:38.009
So, what do you say?

14:38.011 --> 14:39.377
You want me as your dog?

14:39.379 --> 14:42.413
Yeah, I think I do!

14:42.415 --> 14:44.415
Hey, just out of curiosity,
what breed are you?

14:44.417 --> 14:46.251
Actually, I'm a pussy hound.

14:46.253 --> 14:47.752
Really? All right!

14:47.754 --> 14:50.088
That just means
I'm one-sixteenth cat.

14:50.090 --> 14:51.923
Oh, I wish you
hadn't told me that.

14:59.231 --> 15:01.566
Well, Vinny,
welcome to our home.

15:01.568 --> 15:03.067
All right,
this is good.

15:03.069 --> 15:04.736
This is good.

15:04.738 --> 15:06.671
Hey, you guys got a good
banging-broads couch,

15:06.673 --> 15:07.739
you know that?

15:07.741 --> 15:09.207
Vinny,
you must be starving.

15:09.209 --> 15:10.742
What can I make you
for dinner?

15:10.744 --> 15:11.776
Are you kidding?

15:11.778 --> 15:13.077
You're a hardworking lady.

15:13.079 --> 15:14.779
So, tonight, I'm gonna
make you dinner.

15:14.781 --> 15:16.180
Wow.
(chuckles)

15:16.182 --> 15:17.849
Well, thank you, Vinny.

15:17.851 --> 15:19.017
Whoa, whoa, hang on, Lois.

15:19.019 --> 15:20.451
You promised me
we were all eating

15:20.453 --> 15:21.853
my Play-Doh pasta tonight.

15:21.855 --> 15:24.355
Oh, Stewie, did you
make something?

15:24.357 --> 15:26.925
Mmm, oh, it's so yummy.

15:26.927 --> 15:28.927
Num, num, num, num, num.

15:28.929 --> 15:31.729
You better mean
those "nums."

15:31.731 --> 15:33.264
Hey, you,
what's your name?

15:33.266 --> 15:34.432
Chris.

15:34.434 --> 15:36.200
How about I call
you Hat Boy?

15:36.202 --> 15:37.702
Hell yeah!

15:37.704 --> 15:38.937
Lower your voice, Chris.

15:38.939 --> 15:40.738
It's Hat Boy, bitch!

15:40.740 --> 15:42.040
Wow, look at you, Vinny.

15:42.042 --> 15:43.608
It's like you're already
part of the family.

15:43.610 --> 15:46.044
I don't know, fat man,
I think you're jumping the gun.

15:46.046 --> 15:48.546
I mean, crucifixion seemed great
at first, too.

15:48.548 --> 15:50.248
Why are you
doing that?

15:50.250 --> 15:51.950
'Cause I'm mad at this guy.

15:51.952 --> 15:54.085
I'm mad at this jar of
pickles I can't open.

15:54.087 --> 15:55.320
Nail it up.

15:58.924 --> 16:01.292
Hey, guys, I want you to
meet our new dog, Vinny.

16:01.294 --> 16:03.127
Vinny, this is Joe
and Quagmire.

16:03.129 --> 16:04.429
Hey, Vinny.
How you doing?

16:04.431 --> 16:05.463
Real good.

16:05.465 --> 16:06.931
Hey, so I hear
you're a cop.

16:06.933 --> 16:08.099
That's right.

16:08.101 --> 16:09.100
Hey, that's great.

16:09.102 --> 16:10.435
Maybe sometime
you could take me

16:10.437 --> 16:12.603
on a ride-along with you,
show me the neighborhood.

16:12.605 --> 16:15.006
Yeah, I don't take people out
on ride-alongs anymore.

16:15.008 --> 16:18.076
I had a bad experience
with Grimace.

16:20.612 --> 16:24.515
I got to be honest, I can't
get a bead on you, man.

16:33.525 --> 16:35.960
Oh, boy, Vinny, hanging out
with you has been the best.

16:35.962 --> 16:37.028
You want another beer?

16:37.030 --> 16:38.296
No.

16:38.298 --> 16:39.497
I'd love one!

16:39.499 --> 16:40.798
(both laugh)

16:40.800 --> 16:42.600
What? What? The first
thing you said was...

16:42.602 --> 16:44.335
(laughing hysterically):
Oh, my God!

16:44.337 --> 16:46.671
You're on... you're, like,
on another level, Vinny!

16:47.940 --> 16:49.107
Congratulations.

16:49.109 --> 16:50.808
You've won over
a complete imbecile.

16:50.810 --> 16:51.943
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

16:51.945 --> 16:53.644
Did you just speak
ill of the man

16:53.646 --> 16:55.313
who busts his tail
providing for you?

16:55.315 --> 16:57.448
He spent my college fund
on puppet clothes.

16:57.450 --> 16:59.817
Hey, don't get fresh
with me, Estudio.

16:59.819 --> 17:01.052
That's not my name.

17:01.054 --> 17:03.221
That's not even
an Italian version of my name.

17:03.223 --> 17:04.489
Oh, whatever.

17:04.491 --> 17:06.324
PETER: Hey, Vinny, you
want to see a puppet show?

17:06.326 --> 17:08.626
They all got
leather jackets!

17:08.628 --> 17:09.894
God, what a jerk.

17:09.896 --> 17:11.396
If this guy thinks
he's sticking around,

17:11.398 --> 17:12.697
he's sorely mistaken.

17:12.699 --> 17:14.132
I'm going to ruin him.

17:14.134 --> 17:16.634
Just like I ruined
that magician's act.

17:18.237 --> 17:19.404
(applause)

17:19.406 --> 17:21.506
People, people, people.

17:21.508 --> 17:23.908
This man drives a Saturn.

17:27.079 --> 17:29.013
All right, Rupert,
I've been left with no choice.

17:29.015 --> 17:31.382
I'm going to tell Vinny
so much bad news

17:31.384 --> 17:32.650
about Italian-Americans

17:32.652 --> 17:34.652
that he goes
into cardiac arrest.

17:34.654 --> 17:36.087
Vinny, there you are.

17:36.089 --> 17:37.488
I have some
terrible news.

17:37.490 --> 17:40.324
Sal Annuncio's kid was
killed by a falling piano!

17:40.326 --> 17:42.427
Oh! How could this happen?!

17:42.429 --> 17:44.095
That kid was
an honors student!

17:44.097 --> 17:46.097
He'd just applied
to SUNY Albany.

17:46.099 --> 17:47.765
He just <i>got in</i>
<i>to SUNY Albany.</i>

17:47.767 --> 17:49.200
(groans):
Oh!

17:49.202 --> 17:50.435
This is too much, Stewie.

17:50.437 --> 17:51.602
I can't take it.

17:51.604 --> 17:53.204
Oh, my God, it's working.

17:53.206 --> 17:55.039
Hey, Vinny, Bobby
Lammaduro's kid

17:55.041 --> 17:56.574
just got out of
the hospital.

17:56.576 --> 17:58.342
He beat the cancer!

17:58.344 --> 18:00.044
Oh, thank heavens.

18:00.046 --> 18:03.381
Big man in the sky
knows what he's doing.

18:03.383 --> 18:04.749
Chris, what are you doing?

18:04.751 --> 18:07.085
Call me a creep,
you piece of crap!

18:10.522 --> 18:12.190
Hey, Doonesbury,

18:12.192 --> 18:15.026
how about a joke that ain't
for fancy millionaires?

18:15.028 --> 18:17.095
(Stewie sniffling)

18:19.198 --> 18:22.266
(sobbing)

18:22.268 --> 18:24.335
(sobbing continues)

18:25.637 --> 18:28.039
Stewie, what's with
the waterworks?

18:28.041 --> 18:30.241
Oh, um, um...
I-I just...

18:30.243 --> 18:32.310
I realized I paid too much
for my muffler.

18:32.312 --> 18:34.045
Come on, kid,
quit crying.

18:34.047 --> 18:35.780
You're gonna get
your pants wrinkled.

18:35.782 --> 18:37.148
What's the matter?

18:37.150 --> 18:38.382
(sighs)
Fine.

18:38.384 --> 18:39.984
Do you want to know
what's the matter?

18:39.986 --> 18:41.285
You're the matter.

18:41.287 --> 18:43.554
Everyone in this family
is so damn thrilled with you,

18:43.556 --> 18:45.256
they've forgotten
all about Brian.

18:45.258 --> 18:46.624
Well, I'm not thrilled.

18:46.626 --> 18:48.392
I'll never forget Brian.

18:48.394 --> 18:50.094
He was my best friend.

18:50.096 --> 18:53.331
You're not supposed to lose
your best friend at my age.

18:53.333 --> 18:55.800
You're not supposed
to lose him ever!

18:55.802 --> 18:58.936
Look, Stewie, I know it
doesn't seem like it now,

18:58.938 --> 19:00.404
but you're gonna be okay.

19:00.406 --> 19:02.340
Yeah, right.
How do you know?

19:02.342 --> 19:06.511
Because, I once had a thing
happen to me with some stuff.

19:06.513 --> 19:08.112
Really?
That's what's happening to me.

19:08.114 --> 19:09.347
Stuff.

19:09.349 --> 19:11.315
You know, before you guys
found me at the shop,

19:11.317 --> 19:13.017
I lived with an old man
named Leo.

19:13.019 --> 19:15.453
It was just him and me
in a tiny apartment,

19:15.455 --> 19:16.821
and we got pretty tight.

19:16.823 --> 19:18.756
He kind of became
my whole world.

19:18.758 --> 19:22.426
By the time he passed away,
it was real tough.

19:22.428 --> 19:24.428
So, how did he die?

19:24.430 --> 19:26.097
He tried to go
to a yoga class,

19:26.099 --> 19:28.699
and on the first pose, his
ball sack split in half.

19:28.701 --> 19:29.767
Really?

19:29.769 --> 19:31.102
Yeah, it was
on   <i>Dateli.</i>

19:31.104 --> 19:32.370
It was a whole thing.

19:32.372 --> 19:35.640
Anyway, I guess Leo was
kind of like my Brian.

19:35.642 --> 19:38.309
Well, so,
how'd you get over him?

19:38.311 --> 19:40.278
Well, I met your family
in the pet store.

19:40.280 --> 19:42.146
When I saw you guys
looking for a dog,

19:42.148 --> 19:44.048
I kind of sensed
you were all going through

19:44.050 --> 19:45.883
the same feelings of loss
that I was.

19:45.885 --> 19:47.285
And it made me think,

19:47.287 --> 19:49.287
hey, maybe I was meant
to find these guys.

19:49.289 --> 19:51.956
Maybe we were meant
to be together.

19:51.958 --> 19:53.524
You know what, Vinny?

19:53.526 --> 19:56.227
I'm starting to think
that may be true.

19:56.229 --> 19:58.796
(chuckles)
Bring it in, Stewie.

20:03.235 --> 20:05.303
Hey, Stewie,
now that we're pals,

20:05.305 --> 20:07.138
maybe you can
answer me something.

20:07.140 --> 20:09.473
Why does your living room
smell so much like puke?

20:09.475 --> 20:11.542
Somebody throw up a
lot in there once?

20:11.544 --> 20:14.579
Vinny, my friend, you got a lot
of stories to catch up on.

20:14.581 --> 20:16.147
I got most of them on DVD.

20:16.149 --> 20:17.248
Oh, cool.

20:17.250 --> 20:19.050
Like, by season
and stuff?

20:19.052 --> 20:21.819
(chuckles)
No, not by season.

20:26.258 --> 20:28.492
Boy, I can't remember
the last time

20:28.494 --> 20:30.261
Stewie fell asleep
this early.

20:30.263 --> 20:32.863
Well, I think the little guy
had a long day.

20:32.865 --> 20:35.233
All right, come on,
time for bed, Vinny.

20:35.235 --> 20:37.535
I'll tell Peter to turn off
the nightlight this time.

20:37.537 --> 20:40.238
PETER: No! I need it
for in case there's witches!

20:40.240 --> 20:41.505
You know, actually, Lois,

20:41.507 --> 20:43.908
I think I'm gonna sleep
in here with Stewie tonight.

20:43.910 --> 20:45.943
Oh, well,
isn't that nice.

20:45.945 --> 20:47.645
Sleep tight, you two.

20:50.716 --> 20:51.849
(yawns)

20:51.851 --> 20:52.917
Good night, Vinny.

20:52.919 --> 20:54.418
Good night, Stewie.

20:54.420 --> 20:55.920
Hey, you guys know
which room is Peter's?

20:55.922 --> 20:59.991
Across the hall.
Ah, it's too bright in there.
Never mind.
