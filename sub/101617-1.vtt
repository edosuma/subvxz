00:55.791 --> 00:59.708
[woman] Scientists can tell us
many things about space.

01:01.250 --> 01:04.208
They can tell us
how far away the stars are.

01:05.416 --> 01:10.166
They can tell us that space starts
100 kilometers above the Earth.

01:11.125 --> 01:16.041
But they can't tell us
about the space dog!

01:16.791 --> 01:17.791
[barks]

01:19.041 --> 01:24.666
He likes to chase comets
and roll in the stardust!

01:25.500 --> 01:31.708
As far as the space dog's concerned,
the moon is just a big, tempting ball.

01:31.791 --> 01:36.333
And almost every night, he takes a bite.

01:36.416 --> 01:37.416
[grunts]

01:44.750 --> 01:48.541
And that's the real reason
the moon has phases.

01:49.541 --> 01:52.916
So, when the moon is big and round,

01:53.000 --> 01:55.708
that's when the space dog
doesn't take a bite?

01:55.791 --> 02:00.708
That's when the Moon Goddess Chang'e
makes him spit it out.

02:00.791 --> 02:03.375
-Blech! [laughs and snorts]

02:03.458 --> 02:04.541

the scientific explanation?

02:07.250 --> 02:11.083
Sorry, Ba Ba,
I like the Mommy explanation best!

02:11.166 --> 02:13.416

14:48.375 --> 14:51.250
You're so skinny.
Hasn't anybody been feeding you?

14:51.333 --> 14:57.291
The hairy crab is a burrowing crab,
known for its furry claws.

14:57.375 --> 14:59.125
Hi, Ye Ye.

14:59.208 --> 15:03.041
Fei Fei, perhaps we can use my red dates
for our second batch.

15:03.125 --> 15:05.416
Ma Ma preferred melon seeds in the paste.

15:05.500 --> 15:08.791
Oh. Well, my family uses dates
grown in our garden.

15:08.875 --> 15:10.708
If you wanna try one, they're delicious.

15:10.791 --> 15:13.041
-I'm probably allergic to dates.
-Oh.

15:13.125 --> 15:16.416
Besides, we only make them
our special way here.

15:17.208 --> 15:18.250
Okay.

15:18.333 --> 15:19.708
[uncle] Your right or my left?

15:19.791 --> 15:22.375
Seems like this table gets heavier
every year, right?

15:22.458 --> 15:24.000
[Mei] Ooh, hot plate! Careful.

15:28.541 --> 15:32.541
[scoffs] No rabbits at the table.
You remember what Ma Ma said.

15:32.625 --> 15:34.208
Besides, that's my chair.

15:36.291 --> 15:39.166
[Mrs. Zhong] The table looks beautiful.
Um, where should I sit?

15:39.250 --> 15:40.333
[Ba Ba] Here, sit by me.

15:40.416 --> 15:42.500
-[Mrs. Zhong] Oh, thank you.
-[Ba Ba] Of course.

15:42.583 --> 15:44.750
-[Mrs. Zhong chuckles] All right.
-[Ba Ba chuckles]

15:45.708 --> 15:52.666
The hairy crab invades local waters,
damaging fishing nets and native species.

15:52.750 --> 15:55.958
Ah, look how big and bright the moon is!

15:57.375 --> 16:01.208

on the side of your... [giggling]

16:01.291 --> 16:04.625

16:04.708 --> 16:06.416
-[bowl thuds]
-Ma Ma's favorite holiday.

16:06.500 --> 16:07.458
[Ba Ba] Uh...

16:08.375 --> 16:10.750
So, your father tells me
you're fond of Chang'e.

16:14.083 --> 16:18.666
Oh, poor lady, that goddess!
So lonely up there on the moon.

16:18.750 --> 16:21.041
No one but Jade Rabbit
to keep her company.

16:21.125 --> 16:23.833
Oh, come on!
Chang'e loves it up there alone!

16:23.916 --> 16:28.625
That's why she took both immortality pills
instead of saving one for Houyi!

16:28.708 --> 16:32.125
Actually, according to my mother,
I might be related to Houyi.

16:32.208 --> 16:34.875
Houyi, the Archer! Cho!

16:34.958 --> 16:36.958
-[Mrs. Zhong] Chin!
-Ugh! [grunts]

16:37.041 --> 16:40.583
That's not what happened, Auntie.
Houyi was off fighting demons.

16:40.666 --> 16:41.875
With his bow and arrow and--

16:41.958 --> 16:45.750
-When a robber came and tried to st--
-Steal the immortality pills? [scoffs]

16:45.833 --> 16:49.416
Yeah, yeah, yeah, she only put them
both in her mouth as a hiding place.

16:49.500 --> 16:51.000
Not buying it.

16:51.083 --> 16:55.875
Chang'e floated to the sky
while her one true love stayed here.

16:55.958 --> 16:58.333
-[sighs]
-And bit the dust.

16:58.416 --> 17:01.541
Now she lives with a rabbit
instead of a husband. [chuckling]

17:01.625 --> 17:02.625
Good choice.

17:02.708 --> 17:06.666
But it wasn't her choice.
She didn't try to leave Houyi behind.

17:06.750 --> 17:09.416
She misses Houyi
and cries for him every day!

17:09.500 --> 17:11.625
And how do you know that?

17:11.708 --> 17:13.208
They text.

17:13.291 --> 17:16.208
-Don't tease Fei Fei.
-It's just a silly myth.

17:16.291 --> 17:20.833
It's not a silly myth. It's real.
Chang'e is real!

17:20.916 --> 17:22.083
[all gasp]

17:22.166 --> 17:24.250
-Ah... Fei Fei!
-[Chin] Uh-oh!

17:24.333 --> 17:25.166
[sighs]

17:25.833 --> 17:31.208
She's on the moon right now,
waiting for her one and only true love.

17:32.958 --> 17:35.750
Waiting... right, Ba Ba?

17:37.375 --> 17:38.375
[Ba Ba] Uh...

17:41.500 --> 17:42.625
[groans quietly]

17:45.625 --> 17:47.833
Just give her a minute.

17:50.041 --> 17:53.875
[Ling] She's at the top of her class,
but she still believes in Chang'e?

17:59.208 --> 18:03.500
It's you and me, Bungee.
We're the last true believers.

18:04.416 --> 18:05.375
[yelps]

18:06.375 --> 18:07.250

18:17.208 --> 18:18.875
Yeah, a dingbat!

18:19.458 --> 18:21.333
I hope you like dingbats

18:21.416 --> 18:23.541
because you're gonna see
a whole lot more of me.

18:24.166 --> 18:25.458
Whoa! [grunts]

18:25.541 --> 18:26.916
Not if I can help it.

18:44.750 --> 18:45.791
Oh, um...

18:45.875 --> 18:51.041
I saved you a special Mooncake
from my hometown... without dates.

18:51.125 --> 18:52.125
[Fei Fei] Uh...

18:54.625 --> 18:55.833

Chin can be rambunctious at times.
But after a while, you get used to him.

19:05.125 --> 19:09.125
[Mei] Zhong! Get over here
before I kick everyone's butt at Mahjong.

19:09.208 --> 19:12.166
[chuckles] Oh, yes. We'll see.

19:13.375 --> 19:16.500
"Get used to him"?
I'll never get used to him!

19:16.583 --> 19:19.125
What's so special about your Mooncake?

19:19.208 --> 19:22.916
I don't want it, and I don't want you!

But now he's changed.

If Ba Ba could only believe again,
he would never marry that woman.
