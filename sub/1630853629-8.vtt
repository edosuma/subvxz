You are a damn Snarf.

11:27.603 --> 11:29.188
[laughing]

11:29.271 --> 11:33.484
All I know is Cheetara got me through
some long prison nights.

11:34.151 --> 11:35.528
Mm-hmm.

11:35.611 --> 11:38.948
-[Bennie] Man.
-Polka dots, man. Them damn polka dots!

11:39.031 --> 11:40.783
[all] Mmm.

11:41.742 --> 11:44.203
Oh, man. It's getting late
and I'm up early tomorrow.

11:44.870 --> 11:46.622
You got to get back to them hair mines.

11:46.706 --> 11:49.333
[laughter]

11:49.417 --> 11:51.043
Yeah, laugh it up, fellas.

11:51.127 --> 11:55.214
Women shave their heads for 50 bucks
and I turn around and flip it for 300.

11:55.881 --> 11:58.843
Hey, I just want to let you know
that this bald is a choice.

11:58.926 --> 12:01.011
What do you think I can get
if I grew it out?

12:02.722 --> 12:04.223
Some soup at the shelter.

12:04.306 --> 12:05.599
[laughter]

12:07.059 --> 12:08.436
Hey, I'm good, man.

12:09.103 --> 12:11.772
Anyways, Bennie. Thanks again for this.

12:11.856 --> 12:14.775
Yeah, it was good hanging, man.
You an all right dude, man.

12:14.859 --> 12:17.653
I mean, Kelvin like you,
I guess. [chuckles]

12:17.737 --> 12:18.738
He's easy to like.

12:19.905 --> 12:21.115
He's a great kid.

12:21.198 --> 12:24.118
Yeah, man. You know, I'm still not sure

12:24.952 --> 12:28.289
why you wanna deal
with Tasha's crazy ass 24/7.

12:29.248 --> 12:32.126
I'mma let you have that
'cause we're in a bonding mood.

12:32.877 --> 12:35.796
Look, I'd be cool with y'all
moving in in, like, a month.

12:35.880 --> 12:38.966
Maybe when Kelvin finish school. I'll see.

12:39.759 --> 12:40.718
Bennie.

12:41.385 --> 12:44.138
This move is happening
when we say it happens.

12:44.221 --> 12:47.767
Yeah, after I say I'm good.
What you think you're doing here?

12:47.850 --> 12:48.768
[sighs]

12:48.851 --> 12:50.519
I'm trying not to get pissed off.

12:50.603 --> 12:52.146
Okay, what you gonna do?

12:52.229 --> 12:55.983
-You gonna give me some bangs?
-Listen to what I'm saying.

12:56.066 --> 12:59.069
Easy. You ain't my dad
and you damn sure ain't Kelvin's daddy.

12:59.153 --> 13:01.739
Which is why I've been trying to be
such a good guy about this,

13:01.822 --> 13:04.825
but our little beer summit
was not about me getting your okay.

13:04.909 --> 13:06.535
Tasha is my girlfriend.

13:06.619 --> 13:08.537
Let me tell you something about Tasha.

13:08.621 --> 13:10.039
No. I already gave you one.

13:10.122 --> 13:12.958
Okay. Well, what you gonna do?
What you gonna do?

13:13.042 --> 13:14.293
You did not just push me!

13:14.376 --> 13:16.504
-[Duck] Hey!
-[Tony] Hey, come on, man!

13:16.587 --> 13:17.630
[indistinct shouting]

13:17.713 --> 13:19.256
-Get off me!
-Why you grabbing me?

13:19.340 --> 13:21.467
Hey! Y'all can't be acting this way.

13:21.550 --> 13:23.761
Y'all have the same woman in common.

13:24.428 --> 13:25.763
That gotta mean something.

13:25.846 --> 13:29.642
Yeah, it means we both
made the same damn bad decision.

13:29.725 --> 13:33.604
[sniffles] Damn. You know what? Nah.
Mmm. I ain't got time for this bullshit.

13:33.687 --> 13:35.940
Tasha, me and Kelvin is happening.

13:36.023 --> 13:38.943
Get that through your head
and quit making my life so hard.

13:39.026 --> 13:40.319
Yeah, whatever.

13:42.112 --> 13:44.156
Damn, Duck. Why'd you stop me?

13:44.240 --> 13:46.408
I had to. You would have killed him.

13:46.492 --> 13:47.910
Good job stepping in, Duck.

13:47.993 --> 13:50.371
I had to. Noah would have killed him.

13:52.039 --> 13:54.708
[funky instrumental music playing]

13:58.587 --> 14:01.799
Hey, you're not gonna be
slamming cabinets in my kitchen.

14:01.882 --> 14:05.511
Why are you still buying
unfrosted Pop-Tarts? We got money now.

14:06.428 --> 14:08.722
Nope. Uh-uh. We're not doing that. Okay?

14:08.806 --> 14:11.475
I let you be
in your feelings all last night.

14:11.559 --> 14:13.394
No, we was talking about your thing.

14:13.477 --> 14:15.813
What is my thing?

14:16.605 --> 14:18.983
Something like Maya's birthday party?

14:19.650 --> 14:21.443
Negro, that was weeks ago.

14:22.444 --> 14:23.821
Tasha's taking my son.

14:24.405 --> 14:28.033
Bennie… I love that you have
gotten so close to Kelvin.

14:28.117 --> 14:30.953
Shit, even I'm gonna miss
having that kid around, okay?

14:31.036 --> 14:33.247
But Tasha puts that boy first.

14:33.330 --> 14:35.457
If she thinks
this is what needs to happen,

14:35.541 --> 14:36.959
then we got to respect that.

14:39.169 --> 14:42.131
Did Tasha pull your hair too tight?
You came back different.

14:44.216 --> 14:46.719
Bennie, I'm just living our reality.

14:47.553 --> 14:50.389
Now, if the two of you
had some sort of legal agreement,

14:50.472 --> 14:53.350
then you might have a say. But you don't.

14:53.434 --> 14:54.810
[hiccups]

14:54.894 --> 14:57.021
Damn. Now I got the hiccups too.

14:58.564 --> 14:59.773
-Morning.
-Hup.

15:00.274 --> 15:03.235
They gone. Lucretia's face
just scared 'em out of me.

15:04.945 --> 15:07.281
-Where the hell were you yesterday?
-Oh.

15:07.364 --> 15:09.158
I see we're still angry.

15:09.658 --> 15:13.454
Not that it's any of your concern,
but I had a lovely day with Frank,

15:13.537 --> 15:16.248
and I'm here to talk
about what happened at the church.

15:16.916 --> 15:19.501
They still got you up there
ringing the bells?

15:20.961 --> 15:23.422
Can he not be here? Like, ever?

15:24.214 --> 15:25.674
[grumpy voice] "Sanctuary!"

15:27.259 --> 15:28.552
"Lucretia-modo!"

15:32.097 --> 15:33.515
We don't have to talk.

15:34.433 --> 15:38.979
But from now on, if you're gonna go MIA,
make sure you tell somebody.

15:39.063 --> 15:42.775
Oh, my bad. Next time,
I'll make sure I notify management.

15:42.858 --> 15:46.946
Who do you think you're talking to?
I'm your sister, not your employee.

15:47.029 --> 15:50.199
I needed you and you weren't
answering your damn phone.

15:50.282 --> 15:52.660
Oh. Okay. So, you weren't concerned.

15:52.743 --> 15:54.787
You needed me. For what?

15:55.496 --> 15:58.582
Pick up Aaliyah from choir?
Take Maya to soccer?

15:58.666 --> 16:01.961
Do a Costco run?
All the other shit you have me doing.

16:02.044 --> 16:02.962
[scoffs]

16:03.712 --> 16:04.713
Frank sees it too.

16:04.797 --> 16:08.217
Frank… What?
What is Frank doing in my business?

16:08.300 --> 16:11.261
Poor Regina
had to live her life for a day.

16:11.345 --> 16:13.472
I didn't get the scholarship, Lucretia.

16:16.934 --> 16:18.936
I'm sorry. And that sucks.

16:19.520 --> 16:21.313
And we'll figure that out.

16:23.148 --> 16:26.568
But right now, I really need you
to hear what I'm saying.

16:26.652 --> 16:28.529
Oh, you mean what Frank is saying.

16:28.612 --> 16:30.239
Watch yourself, Regina.

16:30.322 --> 16:33.784
You letting a man run your life now?
That's what we doing?

16:33.867 --> 16:36.328
You have some nerve, Mrs. Upshaw.

16:36.412 --> 16:40.582
-At least Bennie's there when I need him.
-Okay. Now you just saying shit.

16:41.959 --> 16:46.255
[chuckles] You know what? You're right.
We don't need to talk… ever.

16:49.591 --> 16:51.552
-[door slams]
-Can't stand her ass!

16:51.635 --> 16:53.137
Then sit down, hoe!

16:54.430 --> 16:58.892
[funky instrumental music playing]

16:59.560 --> 17:03.731
You swung on Noah?
You were supposed to get to know him!

17:03.814 --> 17:05.649
He fight like a bitch.

17:05.733 --> 17:08.152
I tried to have an open mind
with the dude,

17:08.235 --> 17:11.739
-but Kelvin ain't going nowhere with him.
-You think you got a say?

17:11.822 --> 17:14.366
-Yeah. I'm his father.
-And? I'm his mother!

17:14.450 --> 17:16.660
And I've been his mother everyday.

17:16.744 --> 17:19.204
Took you 13 years
just to bring him by for dinner.

17:19.288 --> 17:21.373
-Huh.
-Yeah. That game?

17:21.457 --> 17:22.583
Well, we done playing it.

17:23.459 --> 17:27.629
Listen, Noah is not just good for me.
He's good for Kelvin.

17:27.713 --> 17:31.425
-Oh, yeah?
-Yeah! And if you too stupid to see that…

17:32.426 --> 17:35.220
Well, honestly, I don't give a shit.

17:36.221 --> 17:38.599
I'm telling you.
If you take him, I'mma sue your ass.

17:38.682 --> 17:40.684
Oh, you gonna sue me?
What, we righteous now?

17:40.768 --> 17:43.312
I'm not playing. Joint custody.

17:43.395 --> 17:46.440
Uh... Then he would
still live with me, genius.

17:47.191 --> 17:49.068
Then full custody!

17:49.151 --> 17:50.194
[laughs]

17:50.277 --> 17:53.363
Please. Regina ain't going for that!

17:53.447 --> 17:55.032
Women don't run my life.

17:56.700 --> 17:57.826
You serious.

17:57.910 --> 18:01.038
Yeah, nobody messes with me and my son.
Not even his mama.

18:02.539 --> 18:07.377
Okay, but you know neither one of us
needs to go to a courtroom.

18:08.420 --> 18:12.341
Look. My girl, Riri went through this
with her baby daddy, right?

18:12.424 --> 18:15.385
It took all of their time
and all their money

18:15.469 --> 18:17.971
to have the judge ask the little girl
where she want to live.

18:18.055 --> 18:19.431
So…

18:19.515 --> 18:21.725
So, let's cut the bullshit?

18:21.809 --> 18:23.310
And let Kelvin decide?

18:24.103 --> 18:27.272
And whoever he chooses, uh,

18:27.356 --> 18:28.607
we make it work.

18:28.690 --> 18:29.942
Cool. This will be easy.

18:30.025 --> 18:32.903
We'll put them in the middle of the room
and we'll each call him.

18:34.905 --> 18:38.367
How the hell did you get
two women to give you kids?

18:38.450 --> 18:40.577
Really. We should do
a documentary on this.

18:40.661 --> 18:43.622
-This is a very interesting to me.
-I'm Bennie Upshaw, baby.

18:43.705 --> 18:44.832
I can't…

18:45.624 --> 18:50.587
[funky instrumental music playing]

18:51.255 --> 18:56.260
Okay, so, is it weird that I am totally
a Blanche but not at all a Samantha?

18:56.343 --> 19:00.430
[laughs] We just had sex and that is still
the gayest thing you've ever said.

19:00.514 --> 19:03.517
Right. Okay, whatever, closet queen.

19:03.600 --> 19:05.811
Oh. Okay, so we still on that, huh?

19:05.894 --> 19:08.605
-Are you gonna do something about it?
-Nope.

19:12.651 --> 19:13.902
[knock on door]

19:13.986 --> 19:16.780
No one's home! Damn.

19:16.864 --> 19:18.574
-[knock on door]
-[sighs]

19:18.657 --> 19:21.827
-Bernard, you are the super.
-[sucks teeth, scoffs] Shit, man. Fuck.

19:23.203 --> 19:24.079
[sighs]

19:26.206 --> 19:28.375
-Sydney!
-Sorry, I'm early.

19:28.458 --> 19:33.297
-My mom got called in for a stabbing.
-It just might be that kind of day.

19:33.380 --> 19:35.966
You babysit? How many jobs do you have?

19:36.049 --> 19:37.217
Uh...

19:37.885 --> 19:41.054
Sydney, this is, uh… my friend Hector.

19:41.138 --> 19:43.974
Hector, this is… Sydney.

19:45.601 --> 19:46.518
My daughter.

19:47.603 --> 19:49.021
I didn't know you had a boo.

19:51.565 --> 19:52.566
[laughing awkwardly]

19:52.649 --> 19:56.195
[funky instrumental music playing]

19:58.238 --> 20:01.074
Damn kitchenette. Always out of K-Cups.

20:01.158 --> 20:04.369
God forbid Regina get any Cafe Bustelo.

20:07.164 --> 20:10.751
-I brought a little treat for everybody.
-It's nobody's birthday, Clark.

20:10.834 --> 20:12.336
Oh, no, these are for me.

20:12.419 --> 20:14.713
I got into
the Earn While You Learn program.

20:15.756 --> 20:18.133
-They're paying for your college?
-Mm-hmm.

20:18.800 --> 20:21.094
Your daddy is the head
of thoracic surgery.

20:21.178 --> 20:24.640
I know. I hope people don't think
that's the only reason I got it.

20:25.432 --> 20:27.851
Well, you can't stop people from thinking.

20:31.063 --> 20:33.398
I'm sure you gave a great interview.

20:33.482 --> 20:34.483
Interview?

20:37.402 --> 20:40.072
Hey, busy bee.
You should have got some blue folders.

20:41.281 --> 20:43.325
Did you get a chance to go through them?

20:45.244 --> 20:47.371
You… They just got here.

20:47.454 --> 20:50.123
Oh, too bad.
'Cause I need 'em by the end of the day.

20:50.207 --> 20:51.124
[scoffs]

20:51.208 --> 20:53.418
Oh, Clark. Cupcakes.

20:53.502 --> 20:55.837
-This is gonna set off my Cafe Bustelo.
-[chuckles]

20:57.339 --> 20:59.800
-Congrats, again.
-Thanks.

21:00.342 --> 21:03.220
Now the hard part starts.
Gotta figure out my major.

21:03.303 --> 21:04.304
Huh. Uh-huh.

21:06.890 --> 21:08.267
Nope. That's it.

21:09.268 --> 21:11.186
Y'all about to give me Bell's palsy.

21:11.770 --> 21:14.481
Not that you would care. Y'all would…

21:14.564 --> 21:16.858
I could drop dead at my desk right now,

21:16.942 --> 21:20.362
and y'all would just give me
my own damn forms to do.

21:20.445 --> 21:22.322
Put them in
one of your little blue folders.

21:22.406 --> 21:24.449
So, you don't want a cupcake?

21:24.533 --> 21:27.786
No, Clark! I don't want a damn cupcake.

21:27.869 --> 21:32.249
No. What I want is to be appreciated!

21:33.875 --> 21:38.338
Fuck this place.
Y'all can have it. [chuckles]

21:38.422 --> 21:39.381
I'm out.

21:47.514 --> 21:50.183
This shit is lighter than air!
Where did you buy this?

21:50.267 --> 21:51.351
My housekeeper made 'em.

21:53.312 --> 21:55.022
I hate you, Clark.

21:58.233 --> 22:00.610
[funky instrumental music playing]

22:05.073 --> 22:07.784
I'm so ready to get our Chili's on.

22:07.868 --> 22:10.203
Ooh, girl. I brought my mama's purse.

22:10.287 --> 22:12.622
Bottomless chips? Challenge accepted.

22:12.706 --> 22:14.958
-[laughs]
-I skipped out on lunch to make room.

22:15.042 --> 22:16.668
I got a little woozy during gym,

22:16.752 --> 22:19.463
but I told coach it was that time
and he let me take a nap.

22:19.546 --> 22:21.590
Ooh! We ready, ready.

22:21.673 --> 22:23.842
Oh, Aaliyah. My house for movies.

22:23.925 --> 22:25.344
I'm in. When?

22:25.427 --> 22:26.720
Uh, now?

22:26.803 --> 22:28.805
You think I'd dress like this
if I was going out?

22:29.973 --> 22:31.350
Oh, well…

22:31.433 --> 22:33.477
Come on. I want you there.

22:36.772 --> 22:38.815
We're gonna hang out all weekend anyway.

22:39.566 --> 22:40.567
You get it, right?

22:41.651 --> 22:43.904
-You serious?
-For us.

22:45.280 --> 22:46.656
Movies.

22:47.491 --> 22:48.533
For us.

22:50.660 --> 22:53.038
[Aaliyah] What are we watching?
This is gonna be fun.

22:53.830 --> 22:55.415
'Sup, Savannah? Happy birthday.

22:57.292 --> 22:58.502
[sobbing]

22:58.585 --> 23:00.170
My bad. Am I a day late?

23:01.630 --> 23:02.839
-[sniffles]
-Whoa.

23:02.923 --> 23:03.965
What's going on?

23:05.801 --> 23:06.843
You okay?

23:17.687 --> 23:21.775
[funky instrumental music playing]

23:23.819 --> 23:24.736
Hey, hey, hey.

23:24.820 --> 23:27.739
Bennie, if it's gonna be this busy,
you need to hire a third guy.

23:27.823 --> 23:30.200
Yeah, man,
I ain't had no yard time in days.

23:30.283 --> 23:32.828
I hate that I only
pick up tires for work now.

23:34.287 --> 23:38.208
You know, honestly, when I took this job,
I didn't count on you succeeding.

23:38.291 --> 23:40.001
[chuckling]

23:40.085 --> 23:43.505
I see y'all been putting it in.
You deserve to take the rest of the day.

23:43.588 --> 23:45.507
-Off?
-Off? The rest of the day off?

23:45.590 --> 23:47.217
-[Tony] Yeah!
-But you can't!

23:47.300 --> 23:49.594
Let's stay busy. Let's get back to...

23:49.678 --> 23:51.972
Throw a carburetor
and some other stuff together.

23:52.055 --> 23:53.682
-Hey, what are you doing here?
-Hey.

23:53.765 --> 23:56.893
Uh... I think I quit my job.

23:56.977 --> 24:00.147
You been messing around
and letting that money go to your head.

24:01.773 --> 24:03.150
I don't know what happened.

24:03.233 --> 24:05.694
Things got blurry.
There were cupcakes. I cussed.

24:05.777 --> 24:08.363
Hold up. Hold up.
You have cupcakes where you work?

24:09.531 --> 24:11.324
Shit, I'm on a ten.

24:11.408 --> 24:14.369
And I'm on a twenty.
I'mma go pray for you, Regina.

24:14.453 --> 24:17.497
Hey, man. Hey, neither one of y'all's ass
is in the union,

24:17.581 --> 24:19.207
you better hurry your ass back!

24:19.291 --> 24:21.376
Hand me that screwdriver, baby.
Right there.

24:21.460 --> 24:23.336
-Are you hearing me?
-What?

24:23.420 --> 24:25.964
I quit my job.

24:26.047 --> 24:28.800
Yeah, I heard you. Get it back.

24:29.801 --> 24:31.470
Get it back? Get…

24:31.553 --> 24:34.806
Do you even want to know why I quit?

24:35.599 --> 24:38.477
Baby, if ain't nobody up there
touching you, I don't care.

24:39.227 --> 24:42.898
We need more than one income
'cause Kelvin is moving in with us.

24:42.981 --> 24:45.108
No, I hear you, but with…
[splutters] What?

24:46.526 --> 24:48.028
Kelvin moving in where?

24:48.111 --> 24:49.988
Kelvin's moving in with us.

24:51.406 --> 24:55.202
Tasha think he'll pick her,
but I know I'm way more fun.

24:55.785 --> 24:58.955
Are you… listening to me?

24:59.748 --> 25:01.500
I didn't get the scholarship, Bennie.

25:01.583 --> 25:02.584
Hmm.

25:02.667 --> 25:08.131
So, I quit my job. I'm not about to raise
another damn child. You… [scoffs]

25:08.215 --> 25:11.092
Tasha's his mother.
You will see him on the weekends.

25:11.176 --> 25:14.179
[cell phone ringing]

25:14.262 --> 25:16.306
-[inaudible]
-[sighs] Yeah. Hello?

25:17.432 --> 25:19.768
Speaking? What?

25:20.685 --> 25:22.896
I'm sorry. Okay.
Yeah, I'm sorry. No, it's…

25:22.979 --> 25:27.901
Our wires must have gotten…
Okay. All right. Uh, I'll be right there.

25:28.902 --> 25:29.903
[sighs]

25:30.445 --> 25:33.323
Maya is stuck at school.
Lucretia never picked her up.

25:33.406 --> 25:36.409
What kind of psycho
takes their shit out on someone's kid?

25:38.161 --> 25:39.871
Uh, why are y'all not working?

25:39.955 --> 25:42.666
-Because Bennie said--
-I don't give a damn what Bennie said.

25:42.749 --> 25:46.711
Oh, now I'm gonna have to add you
to the prayer. Addendum, Lord.

25:47.712 --> 25:49.589
Why did you leave Maya at school?

25:49.673 --> 25:51.967
Now I gotta go get lectured
by the principal.

25:52.050 --> 25:55.345
Oh, shit. Damn. It is Thursday.

25:55.428 --> 25:56.805
Obviously, I got mixed up.

25:56.888 --> 26:00.559
I mean, what kind of psycho
takes their shit out on someone's kid?

26:01.268 --> 26:03.061
-I'll go get her.
-No, I got her.

26:03.144 --> 26:04.938
I don't need you doing shit else.

26:05.939 --> 26:08.400
Remember that
as you're walking out of the shop

26:08.483 --> 26:12.320
that you asked me to buy to keep
your sorry-ass husband off the streets.

26:12.404 --> 26:14.197
Why are my ears burning?

26:14.739 --> 26:18.577
I am tired of you.
Why don't you fix that broken-ass record?

26:18.660 --> 26:23.206
Oh, this record works fine. As a matter
of fact, I'm about to play all the hits.

26:23.290 --> 26:27.502
I built this shop. I made this happen.
It's my money in these walls.

26:27.586 --> 26:30.130
Excuse me.
Are you the owner of this establishment?

26:30.213 --> 26:32.048
You goddamn right I am.

26:32.132 --> 26:36.261
You're under arrest for the knowing
purchase and resale of stolen car parts.

26:36.344 --> 26:40.056
You're crazy.
I haven't bought any stolen anything.

26:40.140 --> 26:42.309
-Bennie?
-I gotta go pick up Maya.

26:42.892 --> 26:43.810
Bennie!

26:45.228 --> 26:46.229
[sighs]

26:46.730 --> 26:49.274
Officers, look. I can clear all this up.

26:50.442 --> 26:52.360
Y'all ain't heard the story right.

26:57.115 --> 27:01.328
I am going to squeeze through
these bars and kill you.

27:02.621 --> 27:03.580
Guard!
