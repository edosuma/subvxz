00:10.301 --> 00:12.345
- Hello, Frasier.
- Niles.

00:12.511 --> 00:15.222
Double latte, full fat,
chocolate shavings.

00:18.309 --> 00:22.104
- The self-pity special.
- I've had a hellish week.

00:22.271 --> 00:25.983
To top it off, our wine club president
kicked the bucket.

00:26.150 --> 00:30.905
His body wasn't even chilled before
the club jackals angled to succeed him.

00:31.071 --> 00:33.324
You've never seen such conniving.

00:33.491 --> 00:36.827
- Who's winning?
- Maris, of course, but just barely.

00:36.994 --> 00:39.496
Matthew Pym tried to stage a coup.

00:41.165 --> 00:44.960
Fortunately, Maris has photos
she took at his wedding,

00:45.127 --> 00:47.588
showing the label on the champagne.

00:47.755 --> 00:52.134
- Domestic?
- Not just domestic. From Connecticut.

00:54.970 --> 00:57.306
It's that dreadful woman
who works for you.

00:57.473 --> 01:01.477
- Who?
- Lady Macbeth without the sincerity.

01:01.643 --> 01:02.811
Oh, Bebe's here.

01:03.729 --> 01:08.442
I care for her just as little as you do,
but she is a terrific agent,

01:08.609 --> 01:13.322
which is why I overlook the fact that
she's pushy, obnoxious and a phoney.

01:13.489 --> 01:18.202
- Bebe, darling, how are you?
- My poor, wounded baby.

01:18.368 --> 01:21.830
I heard what those misers
you work for are trying to do.

01:21.997 --> 01:25.792
- They're not going to get away with it.
- You heard wrong.

01:25.959 --> 01:28.629
They extended my contract
with an 8% raise.

01:28.795 --> 01:33.508
8% would insult even a waiter.
Double cappuccino. Move it!

01:33.675 --> 01:36.887
Well, Bebe,
that is what my contract calls for.

01:37.054 --> 01:40.557
A slave contract you negotiated
before you had an agent.

01:40.724 --> 01:44.770
- They took advantage of you.
- I thought it was generous.

01:44.936 --> 01:47.272
Do you have any idea how hot you are?

01:47.439 --> 01:51.318
I get offers every day
offering the moon for you.

01:51.484 --> 01:54.738
- Am I really that hot?
- Are you kidding?

01:54.905 --> 01:57.866
lf I were a pot roast, I'd be done.

01:59.826 --> 02:02.787
I'm Niles, a person at the table.

02:05.790 --> 02:09.919
Niles, thank God you're here.
Give him some brotherly advice.

02:10.086 --> 02:12.881
She's the devil. Run fast, run far.

02:15.508 --> 02:16.926
Bebe,

02:17.093 --> 02:22.515
I realise the station makes a handsome
profit on my show, but what can I do?

02:22.682 --> 02:27.478
- I do have a contract.
- No, darling, what you have is...a fever.

02:27.645 --> 02:31.900
- What?
- Ooh! You're like a furnace!

02:32.066 --> 02:36.863
I think I see where you're going with this
and I'm not sure how I feel about it.

02:37.030 --> 02:40.617
- How do you feel about being low paid?
- Who makes more?

02:40.783 --> 02:44.454
Who doesn't? Nanette
from "Pet Chat", the Happy Chef.

02:44.620 --> 02:47.832
- Father Mike could buy and sell you.
- Father Mike!

02:47.999 --> 02:51.711
- He took a vow of poverty.
- Well, now he's taking a cruise.

02:52.795 --> 02:57.842
Oh, that big, strapping chest
of yours is all congested.

02:58.009 --> 03:01.929
Say the word and I'll tell the station
you have some coughing up to do

03:02.096 --> 03:04.140
and so do they.

03:04.307 --> 03:07.185
Bebe, this fever of mine,

03:07.351 --> 03:10.021
how much higher
do you think it might go?

03:10.187 --> 03:13.274
I'm guessing 30% to 40%
above where it is now.

03:13.441 --> 03:15.151
40%?

03:15.318 --> 03:18.029
Well, what else can I say, but...

03:19.113 --> 03:20.948
...ah-choo.

03:26.037 --> 03:28.622
(TV man)
'You wanted me to get you pregnant.'

03:28.789 --> 03:30.416
(TV woman) 'I was in a coma.'

03:30.583 --> 03:34.628
My God, in one scene
they've got Sky, Zena and Slate.

03:35.713 --> 03:39.925
I don't think someone called Frasier
should point any fingers.

03:41.010 --> 03:44.221
Is this how you spend your days
when I'm not at home?

03:44.388 --> 03:47.641
When you're not home,
I can hear what they're saying.

03:47.808 --> 03:49.894
You wouldn't want to miss this.

03:50.060 --> 03:55.816
"Oh, Zirconia, can't you see Stone
doesn't love you? He loves Placenta."

03:58.902 --> 04:00.946
My favourite are the villains.

04:01.113 --> 04:04.199
One guy kicked
his grandmother down the stairs,

04:04.366 --> 04:07.619
embezzled money from a hospital
and poisoned a puppy.

04:07.786 --> 04:11.665
Give him credit, though.
He did show up for work every day.

04:13.000 --> 04:17.296
lf you're going to be so subtle,
how will I ever get your point?

04:17.462 --> 04:20.423
I think when you sign a contract,
you stick to it.

04:20.591 --> 04:22.634
A man's only as good as his word.

04:22.801 --> 04:27.306
My words have doubled ad revenues
and they gave me a measly 8% raise.

04:27.472 --> 04:31.602
So what? In 30 years on the police
force, do you think I ever said,

04:31.768 --> 04:35.230
"Hey, I'm shooting more bad guys,
how about a bonus?"

04:35.397 --> 04:37.441
(Doorbell rings)

04:37.607 --> 04:39.860
You don't understand.
It's show business.

04:40.027 --> 04:42.070
- I'll get it.
- Thank you, Daphne.

04:42.237 --> 04:46.491
Negotiations are like a dance.
They expect me to fight my contract.

04:46.658 --> 04:50.287
They know I'm not sick. I know they
know. They know I know they know.

04:50.454 --> 04:54.666
- It's all part of the negotiations mambo.
- Hello, Roz.

04:54.833 --> 04:58.170
- Daphne. Hey, Martin.
- How are things at the front?

04:58.336 --> 05:00.922
They painted over
your parking space name.

05:01.089 --> 05:04.050
Perfect. Bebe told me they might.

05:04.217 --> 05:07.429
It's a negotiating tactic.
It shows they're nervous.

05:07.596 --> 05:10.765
They must be jittery.
They took your picture down.

05:10.932 --> 05:15.645
- Roz, they're just trying to scare me.
- He knows they're trying to scare him.

05:15.812 --> 05:19.399
They know that he knows
they're trying to scare him.

05:19.566 --> 05:21.609
Thank you, Dad!

05:22.694 --> 05:26.114
- It's like a card game.
- Like a card game.

05:26.281 --> 05:30.076
It's like a dance.
It sounds like a weekend in Vegas.

05:31.578 --> 05:36.624
I thought they'd play games, too,
but they're auditioning replacements.

05:36.791 --> 05:38.835
- They're interviewing people?
- All day.

05:39.002 --> 05:42.171
They're hot on this woman
who has a gardening show.

05:42.338 --> 05:44.382
She calls herself Ma Nature.

05:45.842 --> 05:49.554
I can't work for her, Frasier.
You should see her nails.

05:49.721 --> 05:51.639
(Doorbell)

05:52.557 --> 05:56.269
There's no need to panic.
I'm sure it's all part of the dance.

05:57.353 --> 06:00.064
The station sent me over
with your stuff.

06:00.231 --> 06:02.567
They've cleaned out my cubicle?

06:02.733 --> 06:06.195
You're up on the gossip.
They're bluffing, right?

06:06.362 --> 06:08.990
I hope not.
My audition went really well.

06:13.953 --> 06:16.122
Nurse Bebe reporting for duty.

06:16.289 --> 06:20.001
Blossoms for my little shut-in.
Put these in something.

06:21.085 --> 06:25.172
Have you heard what's going on?
They're auditioning other people.

06:25.339 --> 06:28.676
Marvellous!
They're resorting to cheap scare tactics.

06:28.843 --> 06:32.471
Looks like I was right
to bring this along. Chill that.

06:33.973 --> 06:36.225
Darling, you're looking pale.

06:36.392 --> 06:40.062
Don't tell me these amateur theatrics
are worrying you?

06:40.229 --> 06:44.984
Well, no, no, but the stress of not
worrying is starting to get to me.

06:45.151 --> 06:47.903
I don't know
if I can take much more of this.

06:48.070 --> 06:51.407
Darling, if that's the way you feel,
then fine.

06:51.574 --> 06:53.826
Let's get this over with.

06:53.993 --> 06:57.329
Frasier, it's for the best.
Trust me on this one.

06:57.496 --> 07:00.833
Tom Duran, please.
Bebe Glaser calling.

07:01.000 --> 07:03.919
Tom, Bebe's bored.

07:04.086 --> 07:07.423
You huffed and puffed,
but our house is still standing.

07:07.589 --> 07:09.633
We'll give you a midnight deadline.

07:09.800 --> 07:14.763
Either call us at Frasier's and we'll
renegotiate or we'll walk! Love you.

07:16.306 --> 07:19.184
That should make them sweat.
Don't you think?

07:19.351 --> 07:21.395
It might.

07:22.479 --> 07:26.358
It's all over, but the waiting.
Canasta, anyone?

07:26.525 --> 07:28.569
Shuffle these.

07:34.408 --> 07:36.034
11:45.

07:37.244 --> 07:41.289
Oh, God. It's over.
They've made the decision. It's over.

07:44.501 --> 07:47.295
It was a fun run while it lasted,
eh, Seattle?

07:47.462 --> 07:49.589
This is Dr Frasier Crane!

07:50.549 --> 07:52.592
And I was listening!

07:54.719 --> 07:56.763
Here we are.

07:56.930 --> 08:01.977
One tea, half-Darjeeling, half-camomile.
Skimmed milk and sweetener.

08:02.143 --> 08:07.941
I thought you'd enjoy a fat free tea
biscuit. Will there be anything else?

08:08.108 --> 08:11.403
- No. You run along. I'm fine.
- Are you sure?

08:11.570 --> 08:16.199
I could wait until you finish the biscuit
and floss your teeth for you.

08:21.538 --> 08:24.541
You are a cheeky little monkey,
aren't you?

08:25.625 --> 08:27.669
This cookie tastes like meat!

08:27.836 --> 08:32.131
Yes and it'll remove tartar
and give you a nice, shiny coat.

08:39.889 --> 08:42.267
I think I'm going to hit the hay, too.

08:42.433 --> 08:46.729
That's risky, isn't it? Leaving us kids
out here unchaperoned.

08:46.896 --> 08:48.940
Better him than me.

08:52.568 --> 08:54.821
Why are you so tense?

08:54.988 --> 08:58.741
This is the best part.
What could be more fun than this?

08:58.908 --> 09:01.619
Watching a loved one be autopsied?

09:04.080 --> 09:06.791
Think of them, sweating in their offices,

09:06.958 --> 09:09.377
chain-smoking, biting their nails,

09:09.544 --> 09:14.298
their ulcers churning out enough acid
to burn a hole in a ship's hull.

09:14.465 --> 09:16.509
Oh, God!

09:18.135 --> 09:20.930
And to think I nearly went into nursing.

09:22.974 --> 09:25.142
You're right, Bebe. You're right.

09:25.309 --> 09:27.812
lf they're foolish enough to let me go,

09:27.979 --> 09:31.357
other stations
would love to have Frasier Crane.

09:31.524 --> 09:33.985
- Exactly.
- Yes.

09:34.151 --> 09:38.864
But it's time to discuss other offers
and consider our fallback position.

09:39.031 --> 09:41.075
Ooh! Someone's out of Scotch.

09:45.329 --> 09:47.832
Bebe, tell me there are other offers.

09:47.998 --> 09:49.834
Scads!

09:50.000 --> 09:53.128
Look me in the eye
and tell me the truth.

09:53.295 --> 09:57.508
There are no other offers.
Straight up or on the rocks?

09:57.675 --> 09:59.260
My God!

09:59.426 --> 10:03.097
Darling, you can't make a deal
without bluffing.

10:03.264 --> 10:05.599
You're supposed to bluff them,
not me!

10:06.684 --> 10:10.854
- Are you trying to ruin me?
- You are such a worrywart.

10:11.021 --> 10:15.609
Don't you patronise me,
you sweet-talking succubus. Call them.

10:15.776 --> 10:19.071
Ooh, my God. Hands of Hercules.

10:20.489 --> 10:22.533
What must your legs be like?

10:23.534 --> 10:25.577
(Phone rings)

10:25.744 --> 10:28.455
- Answer it.
- Not yet.

10:29.540 --> 10:34.002
Where are we? Have we gone out?
Is it too late?

10:34.169 --> 10:36.213
(Shouts) Answer it!!

10:37.130 --> 10:39.466
Crane residence.
Bebe Glaser speaking.

10:39.633 --> 10:43.095
It's them. I see.

10:44.429 --> 10:46.264
I see.

10:47.766 --> 10:49.184
Fine.

10:52.020 --> 10:53.563
Well?

10:53.730 --> 10:56.858
Renegotiations tomorrow,
from scratch.

10:57.025 --> 11:01.196
Dear God! Oh. Oh, we did it.

11:03.740 --> 11:07.410
Oh, my God, I'm so pleased.
Thank you, Bebe.

11:07.577 --> 11:10.539
Maybe next time you'll trust little Bebe.

11:10.705 --> 11:12.874
I'm sorry. I underestimated you.

11:13.041 --> 11:16.461
I'm sorry for that outburst
and for grabbing you.

11:16.628 --> 11:19.547
Don't be. I was impressed.

11:19.714 --> 11:23.551
It was manly
in a...hysterical sort of way.

11:25.470 --> 11:26.888
Cheers.

11:27.972 --> 11:30.975
Champagne on top of Scotch.

11:31.142 --> 11:35.021
- What the hell!
- To a beautiful partnership.

11:35.188 --> 11:38.775
No.
To...a remarkable agent.

11:38.942 --> 11:43.112
What Bebe wants, Bebe gets.
When will I ever learn that?

11:44.030 --> 11:46.074
Soon enough, dear.

11:47.534 --> 11:49.077
Soon enough.

11:51.000 --> 11:57.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

12:09.305 --> 12:13.601
Sorry, Eddie, he's still alive.
You're not getting your own room.

12:15.853 --> 12:18.773
- How're you feeling?
- How do I look?

12:18.981 --> 12:21.025
The last time I saw
a guy who looked like you

12:21.192 --> 12:24.195
he'd been in the trunk of a car
for a month.

12:24.362 --> 12:26.614
Good morning!

12:26.781 --> 12:31.202
My goodness, christened
a few ships last night, I see.

12:31.369 --> 12:34.872
The station agreed to renegotiate.

12:35.039 --> 12:40.169
- Oh, well done.
- They called around five to midnight.

12:40.336 --> 12:44.548
Bebe and I had some champagne
to celebrate and then...

12:45.633 --> 12:47.468
And then...

12:48.719 --> 12:50.554
Oh, God.

12:52.389 --> 12:54.433
Morning, Doctor.

12:59.230 --> 13:01.524
Somebody hold me.

13:02.858 --> 13:05.569
I didn't see a robe and your shirt

13:05.736 --> 13:09.823
is so nice and big
and warm...just like you.

13:11.659 --> 13:16.497
I think I'll go in the other room
and eat my breakfast, while I still can.

13:17.581 --> 13:22.669
I'd better go cook for him. I know how
the Crane men like their legs...eggs.

13:24.463 --> 13:27.674
I think they were a little shocked.

13:27.841 --> 13:30.427
I'm a little surprised myself.

13:30.594 --> 13:34.890
Let's not kid ourselves. We both knew
this would happen someday.

13:35.057 --> 13:37.392
- We did?
- The signs were all there.

13:37.559 --> 13:40.646
The glances, the furtive smiles.

13:40.812 --> 13:44.233
You know what would really hit
the spot right now?

13:44.399 --> 13:47.361
My God, you're a machine!

13:50.405 --> 13:52.449
I meant coffee.

13:52.616 --> 13:54.242
(Doorbell)

13:54.409 --> 13:56.870
- I'll get it.
- That's not necessary.

13:57.954 --> 14:00.749
Good morning, Niles.
What a lovely surprise.

14:00.916 --> 14:04.753
We were about to have breakfast.
Won't you join us?

14:05.587 --> 14:07.422
(Rings doorbell again)

14:10.842 --> 14:13.595
Come on in, Niles. It's all right.

14:19.392 --> 14:24.731
We were celebrating. The station called
to renegotiate my contract.

14:24.898 --> 14:27.734
Paid your commission upfront, I see.

14:30.695 --> 14:34.741
It's getting late. I'll freshen up.
Save me a muffin, muffin.

14:41.372 --> 14:44.375
Oh, all right. Go ahead.
Get your shots in.

14:44.542 --> 14:46.628
I'm just glad you're all right.

14:46.795 --> 14:49.214
I'd assumed she killed after mating.

14:55.595 --> 14:59.724
- Is she gone?
- No, Dad. She's changing.

14:59.891 --> 15:01.935
Oh, my God. How did this happen?

15:02.101 --> 15:04.270
You're asking us?

15:04.437 --> 15:07.982
I've got to tell her
this was just a mistake.

15:08.149 --> 15:11.069
You'd better be careful.
She's liable to go nuts,

15:11.235 --> 15:14.322
like in that movie,
then try to boil Eddie.

15:19.243 --> 15:22.455
- We'll give you privacy.
- I can't tell her now.

15:22.622 --> 15:24.749
She's renegotiating my contract.

15:24.916 --> 15:27.335
- I'll tell her later.
- What a good idea.

15:27.502 --> 15:32.423
Wait till she makes you money,
then you can make her feel really used.

15:32.590 --> 15:34.634
Sounds like a plan to me.

15:35.593 --> 15:38.846
- Darling!
- We'll leave you to your happy task.

15:40.222 --> 15:44.977
Cancel that muffin,
Bebe just started a diet. Wink.

15:46.062 --> 15:48.981
Besides,
tonight we're dining at Bernardi's.

15:49.148 --> 15:53.652
It's sinfully expensive,
but after contract talks, we can afford it.

15:53.819 --> 15:56.655
- Bebe.
- Yes.

15:56.822 --> 16:02.828
Bebe, I don't think there are any words
to describe what we shared last night.

16:02.995 --> 16:06.749
It was like Greco-Roman wrestling
on a trampoline.

16:12.087 --> 16:14.882
As magical as it was,

16:15.049 --> 16:18.594
it's not the kind of thing
we should let happen again.

16:20.387 --> 16:25.934
I value you too much as a colleague
to jeopardise that relationship.

16:28.812 --> 16:31.774
- I see.
- Oh, you're upset.

16:31.940 --> 16:34.610
We'd both have realised
sooner or later.

16:34.777 --> 16:37.863
I was hoping for later,
but sooner's best.

16:38.030 --> 16:40.365
I'd better dash. I'll call you later.

16:46.830 --> 16:50.959
Oh, like you never crawled under
the wrong fence once in your life!

16:57.174 --> 17:01.595
Disaster. Maris's wine club
had an outing to the local vineyard.

17:01.762 --> 17:04.347
As president, she was first into the vat.

17:05.348 --> 17:08.602
Imagine her humiliation
as she danced in a barefoot fury

17:08.769 --> 17:11.313
and was unable to break a single grape.

17:14.608 --> 17:16.734
Have you heard a word I've said?

17:16.902 --> 17:20.155
Of course not.
I'm still worried about Bebe.

17:20.321 --> 17:24.326
- You said she took it well.
- You know how strong women are.

17:24.492 --> 17:27.579
Sometimes strength
masks vulnerability.

17:28.830 --> 17:34.085
Well, let's face it, once a woman
has dipped her toe into Crane Lake...

17:36.588 --> 17:39.257
...dry land is never the same again.

17:40.383 --> 17:44.095
She's probably writing
Mrs Bebe Crane over and over

17:44.262 --> 17:46.306
in the margin of her algebra book.

17:46.473 --> 17:51.186
You can make light of this if you want,
but I may have broken her heart.

17:51.352 --> 17:54.856
- Whose heart did you break?
- No one! Niles, be quiet!

17:55.023 --> 17:59.319
I'm going to figure it out sooner or later.
Give me a clue. Just one.

17:59.485 --> 18:02.655
Doc! Bebe's on the ledge!
She's threatening to jump!

18:02.822 --> 18:06.701
- Oh, my God. This is all my fault!
- Wait! Just give me a hint!

18:12.373 --> 18:15.418
- Bebe, please!
- (Bebe sobs) Get away from me!

18:15.585 --> 18:17.879
Excuse me. What happened?

18:18.046 --> 18:22.508
I don't know. We were working out
your deal and she burst into tears.

18:22.675 --> 18:24.761
I went to get her water.
When I came back,

18:24.927 --> 18:28.598
she's out there,
sobbing she doesn't want to live.

18:33.811 --> 18:36.439
Bebe, it's Frasier. Please come in.

18:36.606 --> 18:40.276
It's no good! My life is over!

18:40.443 --> 18:45.197
You gotta save her. My contract's up
in six weeks. She's my agent, too.

18:47.241 --> 18:49.618
- I'm going out there.
- Are you nuts?

18:49.785 --> 18:52.288
You know what the drop
would do to you?

18:52.455 --> 18:55.166
Toss a pumpkin out,
so I have a clear image.

18:55.332 --> 18:58.210
- Why don't you wait for the police?
- No. No.

18:58.377 --> 19:00.463
That woman out there needs me.

19:01.547 --> 19:06.469
- Bebe, I'm coming out.
- Don't come any closer. I'll jump!

19:06.635 --> 19:09.096
- Bebe, please.
- You can't help me!

19:09.263 --> 19:11.932
No one can help me!

19:12.099 --> 19:14.226
I'm not worth doing this over.

19:14.393 --> 19:16.645
Look, there'll be other men.

19:16.812 --> 19:19.398
It may take time, but you'll get over me.

19:19.565 --> 19:22.109
Somebody thinks well of himself.

19:23.402 --> 19:24.820
What?

19:24.987 --> 19:28.949
This isn't about us.
It's just a little bargaining tactic.

19:34.163 --> 19:36.665
I threaten to jump. You talk me down.

19:36.832 --> 19:39.418
Major coverage.
Bang! Your price goes up 20%.

19:39.585 --> 19:41.628
(Shouts) My life is meaningless!!

19:44.214 --> 19:46.884
Talk to me, darling. Talk to me.

19:47.050 --> 19:49.845
- You're coming in right now.
- Stay away from me!

19:50.012 --> 19:52.055
You can't talk me out of this!

19:52.222 --> 19:55.392
At least
not until Channel Five gets here.

19:56.476 --> 19:58.895
Come on, dear. Make like a therapist.

19:59.062 --> 20:02.524
You're out of your mind.
You should be in therapy.

20:02.691 --> 20:08.697
That's good, but louder.
Give me one reason to live! Just one!

20:12.534 --> 20:14.578
Well, there are...

20:14.745 --> 20:17.038
...hundreds of reasons.

20:19.749 --> 20:22.544
Work, art,
the people who care about you.

20:22.711 --> 20:24.963
Now, come in, you crazy bitch!

20:25.130 --> 20:30.552
(Helicopter circles)

20:33.138 --> 20:36.975
Channel Five, come to Mama!

20:38.727 --> 20:41.771
Here's the plan.
I swoon forward, you catch me.

20:41.938 --> 20:44.566
- What?
- On three. One, two...

20:44.733 --> 20:46.609
- No!
- ...three!

20:48.903 --> 20:50.947
Film at 11:00.

20:54.159 --> 20:56.327
Just get in.

20:57.745 --> 21:01.708
- Are you all right?
- Yes, I'm fine now.

21:01.875 --> 21:05.712
Get her some water.
Do you want to sit down?

21:06.629 --> 21:10.758
Thank you, Frasier. You saved my life.

21:12.302 --> 21:14.721
That was incredible, Frasier.

21:14.887 --> 21:18.349
Look, I know we've got
some unfinished business,

21:18.516 --> 21:22.645
but after this, there's no way
we're going to let you get away.

21:22.812 --> 21:25.440
Well, thank you, Tom.

21:25.606 --> 21:29.777
lf I could just have
a moment alone with Bebe?

21:29.944 --> 21:31.779
Sure.

21:38.786 --> 21:41.205
What kind of a woman are you?

21:41.372 --> 21:44.250
You seduced me, lied to me.
nearly got me killed.

21:44.417 --> 21:46.794
You've shamelessly manipulated me,

21:46.961 --> 21:50.214
the station,
the media and the city of Seattle.

21:50.381 --> 21:53.467
What do you have to say for yourself?

21:55.052 --> 21:57.596
Aren't you glad I'm on your side?

22:05.062 --> 22:07.690
Yes, I suppose I am.

22:13.279 --> 22:18.909
# Hey baby, I hear the blues are calling
tossed salads and scrambled eggs

22:19.076 --> 22:20.286
# Quite stylish!

22:20.452 --> 22:22.621
(Song continues over dialogue)

22:22.788 --> 22:27.459
# Maybe I seem a bit confused
Well, maybe...but I got you pegged!

22:27.626 --> 22:33.298
# But I don't know what to do with those
tossed salads and scrambled eggs

22:33.465 --> 22:35.926
# They're calling again #

22:36.093 --> 22:38.971
Good night, Seattle, we love you!
