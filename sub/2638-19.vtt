...there's something that occurs in beehives
you might find interesting.

13:28.824 --> 13:34.023
Occasionally, a new queen will arrive
while the old queen is still in power.

13:34.230 --> 13:38.326
When this happens, the old queen
must either locate to a new hive...

13:38.534 --> 13:44.495
...or engage in a battle to the death
until only one queen remains.

13:46.208 --> 13:48.802
What are you saying?
That I'm threatened by Alicia?

13:49.011 --> 13:52.777
That I'm like the old queen of the hive,
and it's just time for me to go?

13:52.982 --> 13:55.746
I'm just talking about bees.

13:55.951 --> 13:58.579
They're on The Discovery Channel.

PENNY: Mm-hm.

14:17.773 --> 14:19.638
-Yeah, what's the occasion?
-No occasion.

14:19.842 --> 14:23.107
Just felt like getting some Chinese chow
for my peeps.

14:24.613 --> 14:27.605
Did you remember to ask for the chicken
to be diced not shredded?

14:27.816 --> 14:29.647
Even though the menu
specifies shredded?

14:29.852 --> 14:32.821
Brown rice, not white? Stop at the grocery
and get the mustard?

14:33.022 --> 14:35.422
Pick up the low-sodium soy sauce
from the market?

14:35.624 --> 14:36.852
Good.

14:39.194 --> 14:40.491

14:43.699 --> 14:45.166

-I got a callback to audition for <i>CSI...</i>

15:08.557 --> 15:12.550
-...to play a hooker who gets killed.
-Oh, I'd watch that.

15:13.729 --> 15:17.392
But my car is in the shop

15:17.600 --> 15:20.728
-Okay, well, I'll take you.
ALICIA: Oh, you're a lifesaver.

15:20.936 --> 15:23.131
-I'll run lines with you in the car.
ALICIA: Great.

15:23.339 --> 15:25.967
And afterward,
I'll take you all out for Chinese.

15:40.122 --> 15:43.319
I cannot believe they're letting her
just use them like that.

15:43.525 --> 15:46.653
Anything she wants,
they go panting after her like trained dogs.

15:46.862 --> 15:49.626
Just last week, she had Howard
drive to her uncle's house...

15:49.832 --> 15:51.800
...in Orange County to pick up her TV?

How much do physicists make?

Um.... Ah.

for a second?

Well, you know,
it's just that Leonard and Howard and Raj...

Okay, they're special, and....?

17:16.952 --> 17:19.785
Let's see. How can I explain this?

17:20.055 --> 17:23.455
-They don't know how to use their shields.
-Shields?

17:23.659 --> 17:27.459
Yeah, you know, like in <i>Star Trek</i> when
you're in battle and you raise the shields?

because you're leading them on.

that he can be defeated by the color yellow.

Only the modern Green Lantern
is vulnerable to yellow.

was vulnerable to wood.
