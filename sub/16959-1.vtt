<i>The sun is actually coming through
the heavy cloud cover, as well,</i>

02:30.143 --> 02:32.942
<i>not as the sun, but just as kind of like</i>

02:33.580 --> 02:36.736
<i>a mozzy dot up in the sky.</i>

02:36.816 --> 02:38.682
<i>It's not giving any heat, that's for sure.</i>

02:38.952 --> 02:43.117
<i>Make sure that your water for your dog
in the bowl is not frozen.</i>

02:43.390 --> 02:45.950
<i>A terrible thing happened.
I was told this, that</i>

02:46.126 --> 02:51.121
<i>three dogs last week, it was so cold,
it was five degrees in the morning,</i>

02:51.298 --> 02:54.810
<i>and three dogs got brought to the vet's
'cause their tongues were swollen.</i>

04:02.902 --> 04:04.666
I thought you had to be back at work.

04:07.841 --> 04:09.036
I do.

04:14.748 --> 04:16.875
Is this like a peach?

04:20.720 --> 04:22.154
I call it taupe.

05:10.770 --> 05:13.137
- Hey.
- Hi, Laura.

05:13.807 --> 05:15.435
- Mr. Fuller's here to see you.
- 2:10.

05:16.276 --> 05:17.266
What?

05:18.378 --> 05:21.177
I was starting to think
it might be some kind of holiday.

05:21.348 --> 05:22.839
Yeah, I had a lunch meeting.

05:28.355 --> 05:29.345
Hey, Dennis.

05:47.574 --> 05:49.202
Mr. Fuller.

05:51.845 --> 05:53.143
What're you doin' here?

05:53.713 --> 05:55.011
I came to see my lawyer.

06:08.862 --> 06:13.095
Listen. You can't keep coming here.

06:13.466 --> 06:15.367
My wife wants me out of the house.

06:15.668 --> 06:20.663
Well, go to the library. Read a book.
Make some friends.

06:20.907 --> 06:24.400
I can't read. The lines are all squiggly.

06:26.413 --> 06:27.881
Who set this door?

06:28.181 --> 06:29.171
What?

06:29.416 --> 06:30.509
It's out of plumb.

06:34.254 --> 06:38.123
He may've been slow, but he sure was sloppy.

06:39.559 --> 06:44.554
Look, I know
a personal injury lawyer in Billings

06:44.731 --> 06:47.132
who's willing to give you a second opinion.

06:47.434 --> 06:49.960
So, I set something up for Friday.

06:50.136 --> 06:53.129
And we can meet there. It's at noon.

06:53.440 --> 06:55.102
See, it's good I came by.

06:55.275 --> 06:58.798
Otherwise, how would I know
we're having a meeting in...

06:58.878 --> 07:00.367
- Billings.
- Yeah, Billings.

07:00.447 --> 07:01.968
Well, I was gonna call you.

07:02.048 --> 07:04.244
Well, now I know.

07:04.484 --> 07:06.612
Well, now you know.

07:06.786 --> 07:09.221
Friday at noon.

07:10.123 --> 07:11.716
- Okay.
- Okay.

07:12.325 --> 07:15.386
Good work. So, now we can prepare.

07:15.562 --> 07:17.428
No, no, no, no, no. We don't need to prepare.

07:17.597 --> 07:20.931
We just get there
and explain your situation, and that's it.

07:23.403 --> 07:25.668
Mr. Fuller, I don't want you
to get your hopes up.

07:26.406 --> 07:28.428
He's gonna tell you the same stuff
I've been telling you.

07:28.508 --> 07:30.930
I just... I want you
to hear it from somebody else.

07:31.010 --> 07:35.675
You wanna get a coffee?
You know, so we can strategize.

07:35.915 --> 07:37.611
I have court.

07:46.526 --> 07:47.687
Friday at noon.

07:47.861 --> 07:49.420
Friday. Noon.

07:50.897 --> 07:53.059
I'll see you Friday.

08:37.910 --> 08:40.244
The contractor's clearly negligent.

08:40.980 --> 08:41.970
Yes!

08:42.649 --> 08:43.639
You see?

08:43.917 --> 08:46.819
But your previous settlement
precludes a tort claim.

08:47.487 --> 08:52.188
Employees are required to have insurance,
so workers' injuries can be covered.

08:52.358 --> 08:55.089
But as soon as you take that first money,
you've settled.

08:55.261 --> 08:56.382
And you give up your right to sue...

08:56.462 --> 08:58.585
That money didn't cover the month's mortgage.

08:58.665 --> 09:01.354
When you accepted what they offered,

09:01.434 --> 09:04.165
you cleared them of any further penalties.

09:04.537 --> 09:06.096
So?

09:06.439 --> 09:10.774
So, I'm afraid you have no tort claim.

09:11.511 --> 09:13.002
You can't sue.

09:19.953 --> 09:20.943
Okay.

09:27.393 --> 09:28.486
Okay?

09:32.966 --> 09:35.197
- Thank you.
- Laura.

09:35.368 --> 09:38.497
Eight months of telling him,
but now it's okay.

09:59.392 --> 10:00.382
Hey.

10:00.560 --> 10:02.392
<i>I was expecting your voicemail.</i>

10:02.562 --> 10:03.996
You got me.

10:04.731 --> 10:05.824
<i>I thought you had a meeting.</i>

10:05.999 --> 10:08.730
I do. I did. It's a thing done.

10:09.369 --> 10:12.396
The lawyer said, "You have no case,"
and my client said, "Okay."

10:12.572 --> 10:14.734
- <i>Just like that?</i>
- Just like that.

10:15.408 --> 10:18.936
He repeated the same things
I've been saying for the last eight months.

10:20.013 --> 10:22.573
It'd be so lovely to think
that if I were a man,

10:22.782 --> 10:26.514
I could explain the law
and people would listen and say, "Okay."

10:26.786 --> 10:29.119
That would be so restful.

10:30.056 --> 10:33.185
So, what were you gonna tell my voicemail?

10:35.595 --> 10:36.756
<i>Well...</i>

10:38.731 --> 10:42.532
<i>Well, it's just my situation,
being what it is.</i>

10:46.105 --> 10:49.269
- <i>I just think maybe...</i>
- I may not have long here.

10:49.709 --> 10:54.704
Thank you for your generous,
loving fucking attitude!

10:55.148 --> 10:58.277
<i>I just think maybe I got my hands full.</i>

11:08.761 --> 11:10.252
I'm riding with you.

11:11.631 --> 11:13.623
Look, I've gotta go.

11:35.655 --> 11:38.284
Do you want something to eat?

13:03.242 --> 13:06.235
No one understands what my life has become.

13:08.181 --> 13:13.176
What a total fucking miserable thing
my life has become.

13:14.287 --> 13:17.553
No one understands one fucking thing!

13:23.229 --> 13:26.199
Wish my wife would roll over on the highway.

13:26.766 --> 13:30.533
Oh, my God, I swear,
I will leave you right here.

13:35.608 --> 13:39.409
The only thing left to do
is get a machine gun and kill everyone.

13:41.781 --> 13:42.771
No.

13:44.784 --> 13:47.049
No, you're gonna have to get out.

13:47.220 --> 13:48.620
All right. I...

13:48.788 --> 13:51.781
Out. No. You can't say those things to me.

13:53.092 --> 13:55.960
I'll... Not another word. I'll...

13:56.128 --> 13:59.496
- You can't talk like that.
- Never mind. I'll be quiet.

14:05.805 --> 14:06.795
Okay.

14:11.911 --> 14:12.901
I'm a lawyer.

15:46.772 --> 15:49.595
<i>This type of ware is generally
referred to as China painting.</i>

15:49.675 --> 15:53.299
<i>Now in the late 19th century
and into the early part of the 20th century,</i>

15:53.379 --> 15:56.002
<i>ladies of fashion would get together
at China painting parties</i>

15:56.082 --> 15:58.104
<i>and paint these plates or blanks.</i>

15:58.184 --> 15:59.171
<i>Yes.</i>

15:59.251 --> 16:00.773
<i>So all of these blanks have a mark
on the back of them.</i>

16:00.853 --> 16:02.675
<i>We won't turn them around.
But they all say "Limoges."</i>

16:02.755 --> 16:05.278
<i>There were also German and Austrian makers
that made the blanks</i>

16:05.358 --> 16:06.724
<i>that would be imported to the States.</i>

16:22.942 --> 16:25.138
<i>316, Dispatch. Go ahead.</i>

16:25.444 --> 16:28.367
<i>Hey, listen, Will, I don't wanna press ya.</i>

16:28.447 --> 16:32.939
<i>I want you to take your time,
but could you just give me a sign</i>

16:33.019 --> 16:35.784
<i>that Big Man is doing all right?</i>

17:14.426 --> 17:17.920
<i>Hey, Will, good news. Your lawyer's here.</i>

17:25.438 --> 17:28.203
- Well, thanks for coming down.
- Yeah.

17:29.842 --> 17:32.231
Got Fuller on the phone.
Well, we had him on the phone.

17:32.311 --> 17:35.975
He seemed calm.
He's holding the night watchman.

17:36.882 --> 17:38.537
Wait, that's the one they call "Big Man."

17:38.617 --> 17:39.972
Yeah. Football player.

17:40.052 --> 17:41.452
How'd Fuller take him down?

17:42.021 --> 17:43.011
No idea.

17:45.291 --> 17:48.080
Wells, this is Mac,
our resident hostage specialist.

17:48.160 --> 17:49.526
- Hi.
- Hi.

17:50.229 --> 17:55.861
So, he's got Big Man
up here on the 3rd floor.

17:57.036 --> 17:59.028
Back here's where they keep the dead files.

17:59.205 --> 18:01.197
Yeah, that's where they keep the dead files.

18:01.373 --> 18:06.539
And got this little sketch
to help you find your way in.

18:08.481 --> 18:10.040
So...

18:11.350 --> 18:12.750
- Turn around.
- Really?

18:13.052 --> 18:15.578
Yeah. Little precaution.

18:15.754 --> 18:17.154
Just need you to take off your coat, please.

18:19.892 --> 18:20.882
Okay.

18:21.861 --> 18:23.056
All right, arms out.

18:25.498 --> 18:26.659
There ya go.

18:29.235 --> 18:30.225
I remember you.

18:30.402 --> 18:35.397
You wrote a report
for a child custody case of mine.

18:36.876 --> 18:41.075
"Defendant instructed me to consume feces."

18:44.517 --> 18:47.681
Hey, is this an insane thing to be doing?

18:50.689 --> 18:52.214
You're doing that. Here, Tommy.

18:55.027 --> 18:56.495
- Okay.
- Yeah?

18:56.896 --> 18:58.296
Okay, I want you to take this.

18:58.464 --> 19:00.433
- Yeah?
- Take it in with you. I'll call it.

19:00.599 --> 19:03.865
- Okay.
- You pick it up, so that we know you're okay.

19:04.270 --> 19:07.240
You don't pick up, we're wondering.

19:07.540 --> 19:10.262
You know, you don't have to go in there.
There's other ways to go about this.

19:10.342 --> 19:13.032
No. We got this handled.
We don't need any big production.

19:13.112 --> 19:14.400
Right, Wells?

19:14.480 --> 19:17.109
Well, I'm here. So.

19:18.417 --> 19:22.115
Okay, well, just keep him engaged
in the conversation,

19:22.555 --> 19:27.116
just try to be compassionate,
let him feel like he's being heard.

19:27.293 --> 19:30.049
It's important that he sees you
as being his advocate.

19:30.129 --> 19:32.318
And there's nothing wrong
with throwing blame on someone else.

19:32.398 --> 19:34.333
You know, blame the system.

19:35.134 --> 19:37.933
Make him feel like you're on his side.

19:38.671 --> 19:40.640
You got that, Wells? Keep him talking.

19:42.508 --> 19:44.306
Here we go. This.

19:45.778 --> 19:46.905
Okay.

19:47.580 --> 19:50.106
Don't sweat it. You'll be great.

19:53.786 --> 19:57.154
Just right in there. Center door.

19:57.590 --> 19:58.580
Okay.

20:57.049 --> 21:00.573
Fuller? It's me.

21:00.653 --> 21:02.246
I'm here to find your file.

21:05.057 --> 21:07.686
Should I come to you or go get the file?

21:09.662 --> 21:11.153
Go get the file.

21:22.341 --> 21:23.900
Is Big Man okay?

21:26.445 --> 21:28.243
It's Amituana.

21:29.348 --> 21:33.251
Did you know he's a member
of the Samoan royal family?

21:35.387 --> 21:36.753
No, I didn't.

21:52.137 --> 21:55.073
So does that make him a prince?

22:01.714 --> 22:05.913
Sort of. If 14 people die, I'll be king.

22:09.421 --> 22:11.322
How likely is that?

22:12.858 --> 22:13.848
Not very.

22:25.204 --> 22:26.604
Okay.

22:27.873 --> 22:29.501
I've got the file.

22:30.542 --> 22:31.703
Should I come?

22:32.444 --> 22:35.778
We're in the third cubicle from the door.

23:13.385 --> 23:15.217
Sorry to get ya out of bed.

23:15.754 --> 23:17.052
Sit down.

23:23.095 --> 23:26.224
Hey. I'm Laura Wells.

23:26.398 --> 23:28.560
- Amituana.
- Hey.

23:30.836 --> 23:33.192
Read me the file.

23:33.272 --> 23:37.663
Not the stuff I said,
just the stuff they said about me.

23:37.743 --> 23:39.498
I wanna hear all the letters.

23:39.578 --> 23:42.104
That would take all night. It's like...

23:44.850 --> 23:46.284
So start.

23:53.892 --> 23:57.420

26:34.419 --> 26:35.409
Go on.

26:36.188 --> 26:39.056
Some of this is dictated. I'm sorry.

26:40.859 --> 26:42.725
I'm not good at dictating letters.

26:44.229 --> 26:45.595
Just keep going.

26:47.899 --> 26:52.224
"And accordingly,
no additional cause of action lies.

26:52.304 --> 26:55.193
"This remains the case,
despite the neurologist's report

26:55.273 --> 26:58.710
"citing your lingering double vision,
memory loss, and fainting spells.

27:00.646 --> 27:03.548
"Please accept my wishes
for a speedy recovery.

27:05.717 --> 27:08.312
"Truly yours, Laura Wells."

27:13.592 --> 27:15.220
You got screwed.

27:16.995 --> 27:18.224
Thank you.

27:22.768 --> 27:24.396
What can I do now?

27:25.103 --> 27:27.629
Tell me. Now, what can I do?

27:32.077 --> 27:33.477
Give yourself up.

27:33.979 --> 27:34.969
No!

27:35.147 --> 27:37.810
God damn it, I'm serious here.
I'm talking about the case.

27:37.983 --> 27:39.815
I don't think you can do anything.

27:39.985 --> 27:42.079
Go to physical therapy.

27:42.954 --> 27:44.183
Be nice to your wife.

27:59.771 --> 28:01.865
I'm letting Amituana go.

28:05.177 --> 28:06.167
Okay.

28:06.778 --> 28:07.768
All right.

28:13.685 --> 28:18.680
If you get to be King of Samoa
and I show up there,

28:19.691 --> 28:21.387
you'll have a job for me, right?

28:22.227 --> 28:26.460
You'll remember I got screwed
and I let you go.

28:27.332 --> 28:28.322
Sure.

28:28.500 --> 28:32.699
Okay. Why don't ya take the stairs
and you go on outside?

28:35.874 --> 28:38.708
And tell them if they try anything,
I'll kill the woman.

28:40.011 --> 28:41.377
She's my lawyer.

28:42.914 --> 28:44.507
I got reason to kill her.

28:46.885 --> 28:48.148
You tell 'em that.

29:00.332 --> 29:01.486
You can still help me.

29:01.566 --> 29:05.824
Yeah, if you turn yourself in,
we can gin up a mental defense

29:05.904 --> 29:06.992
- and get you a good lawyer.
- No.

29:07.072 --> 29:08.527
I'll slip out the back
where they don't expect me.

29:08.607 --> 29:12.374
You go out the front to the parking lot
where you came in and keep 'em busy.

29:14.346 --> 29:18.681
Stand in the door
and pretend I've got the gun on you,

29:19.184 --> 29:22.450
and relay messages to the cops
like I'm hiding there.

29:23.255 --> 29:26.953
Tell 'em I want a car, and I want $3,000,

29:27.893 --> 29:29.623
and I want an hour's head start.

29:30.128 --> 29:32.723
Afterwards they'll never know
I wasn't there with a gun.

29:33.231 --> 29:36.463
Just give me a chance
to get out the back and get away.

29:38.603 --> 29:41.893
But don't you think
there's cops out back, too?

29:41.973 --> 29:45.102
No, no, they all stayed out front
where I told 'em I'd come out.

29:46.978 --> 29:47.968
Will you do it?

29:48.880 --> 29:49.973
Okay.

29:52.884 --> 29:54.806
It'd be so much better for you
if you turn yourself in...

29:54.886 --> 29:56.787
We're coming out.

30:01.293 --> 30:02.420
Let's go.

30:21.980 --> 30:22.970
Okay.

30:30.822 --> 30:31.812
Okay.

30:33.124 --> 30:37.755
Now, you wait a minute before you go out.

30:38.196 --> 30:39.186
All right?

30:40.298 --> 30:41.664
- Okay?
- Okay.

31:19.704 --> 31:22.469
He's in back. He's unarmed.

31:27.078 --> 31:28.569
You did good.

34:08.473 --> 34:11.466
Hi. What's so funny?

34:12.043 --> 34:13.033
Nothin'.

34:15.547 --> 34:17.175
- How'd you sleep?
- Fine.

34:18.083 --> 34:19.880
Did you hear those coyotes howling?

34:20.051 --> 34:21.246
I was sleeping.

34:48.079 --> 34:49.377
How was your run?

34:50.081 --> 34:51.071
Fine.

34:56.920 --> 34:58.549
What were you two laughing about?

34:58.923 --> 35:00.118
Nothing.

35:10.935 --> 35:13.700
I was showing her my poses.

35:14.873 --> 35:17.809
This is the crab. We call it the crab.

35:27.986 --> 35:29.784
Well, she thought it was funny.

35:58.583 --> 36:00.142
You hear those coyotes last night?

36:03.788 --> 36:06.257
- Crazy.
- Yeah. I wonder what they got.

36:06.758 --> 36:08.090
I don't know.

36:12.664 --> 36:14.132
I'm gonna put this stuff in the car.

36:46.497 --> 36:47.487
Here.

36:55.873 --> 36:56.863
That's it.

36:57.041 --> 36:58.134
- You got it?
- Yeah.

37:17.562 --> 37:18.928
Thanks for helping out.

37:20.999 --> 37:22.297
No one asked me.

37:25.036 --> 37:30.031
No one asked me to, either.
I just kind of figured it out all by myself.

37:40.418 --> 37:41.408
Did you brush your teeth?

37:41.586 --> 37:43.282
- Yeah.
- Really?

37:44.055 --> 37:46.786
'Cause your toothbrush is in here,
and there's a bottle of water.

37:47.025 --> 37:49.392
Mom. I said I brushed them.

37:50.094 --> 37:52.083
Okay. Because now would be a good time.

37:52.163 --> 37:56.533
Oh, God, why even bother asking me
if you're never gonna believe me anyway?

38:04.275 --> 38:05.368
Now?

38:05.543 --> 38:06.533
The sandstone?

38:06.711 --> 38:07.906
Wait. What? You...

38:08.112 --> 38:10.377
- One more stop.
- You said I wouldn't be out all day.

38:10.548 --> 38:12.141
You said I could have Sunday at home.

38:12.650 --> 38:13.982
I'm gonna grab the fence.

38:27.332 --> 38:30.166
You know, Guthrie,
you might get a kick out of this.

38:30.802 --> 38:33.067
It's cut sandstone from pioneer days.

38:33.338 --> 38:36.001
Chiseled by pioneer hands.

38:37.141 --> 38:38.473
It was a schoolhouse once.

38:38.643 --> 38:41.010
Dad, like I care.

38:51.322 --> 38:52.312
Listen.

38:53.324 --> 38:57.921
Let's you and I make an effort
to be nice to your mom today.

38:58.830 --> 39:00.765
Okay? Let's just cut her some slack.

39:02.467 --> 39:05.130
Why? Is she sick or something?

39:05.803 --> 39:07.362
No, she isn't sick.

39:08.473 --> 39:10.203
Just be nice to her.

39:12.310 --> 39:13.300
Because?

39:14.379 --> 39:18.783
Because she works really hard.

39:19.183 --> 39:20.378
She does a lot for us.

39:23.855 --> 39:27.053
Because neither of us
would do very well without her.

39:30.962 --> 39:32.021
God, Dad.

39:33.364 --> 39:35.128
You're building her a house.

39:35.867 --> 39:37.335
How much better can you be?

40:18.609 --> 40:20.100
So you'll ask Albert?

40:21.412 --> 40:23.040
You always know what to say to him.

40:25.016 --> 40:26.348
What's to know?

40:27.518 --> 40:29.350
I just mean, he trusts you.

42:04.515 --> 42:08.043
Guthrie. Guthrie. Guthrie.

42:09.620 --> 42:12.021
- Come say hi to Albert.
- No.

42:12.356 --> 42:15.446
No way, Dad. Every time we come out here,

42:15.526 --> 42:18.826
you guys swear it won't take all weekend,
but it always...

42:25.736 --> 42:27.534
I don't know why you indulge her.

42:28.539 --> 42:30.201
I was just talking to her.

42:31.576 --> 42:34.512
We did tell her that we weren't
gonna keep her out here all day.

42:37.648 --> 42:39.549
God, you really can't help it.

42:40.551 --> 42:41.541
What?

42:41.719 --> 42:43.244
Making me the bad guy.

42:44.589 --> 42:46.387
- Always.
- Whatever.

42:55.900 --> 42:58.062
I wonder how much more
there might be buried here.

42:58.569 --> 42:59.662
I don't know.

43:00.504 --> 43:02.268
Let's let him know we're here.

43:34.438 --> 43:35.565
You ask.

43:36.107 --> 43:37.268
You'll help.

43:39.143 --> 43:40.611
We should've brought him something.

43:45.950 --> 43:47.418
Hello, Albert.

43:47.585 --> 43:48.609
Hi, Albert.

43:53.824 --> 43:55.224
You're back in town.

43:55.393 --> 43:56.383
Yes.

43:56.560 --> 43:57.823
- Come in.
- Thank you.

44:04.335 --> 44:05.963
Nice and warm.

44:17.248 --> 44:18.238
Yeah.

44:25.656 --> 44:27.488
- Please.
- Thank you.

44:33.831 --> 44:34.924
How are you?

44:35.700 --> 44:39.660
I fell last week.

44:39.837 --> 44:41.430
I was on the phone.

44:42.106 --> 44:43.665
But some people were here.

44:44.508 --> 44:45.669
And I banged my head.

44:45.843 --> 44:47.641
Is there anything that we can do to help?

44:47.812 --> 44:49.178
Do you need anything?

44:49.346 --> 44:51.679
No. Don't need anything.

44:52.683 --> 44:54.276
I cook up big soups.

44:54.685 --> 44:56.677
So I got stuff in the freezer.

45:00.725 --> 45:03.217
- You still play guitar?
- I can play.

45:03.394 --> 45:05.522
We supposed to play somewhere?

45:06.197 --> 45:09.725
I don't think so. But it would
sure be fun to hear you play.

45:10.501 --> 45:11.628
Well, yes.

45:14.138 --> 45:16.369
I've got milk and everything.

45:17.141 --> 45:18.871
When my friends came by, they brought milk.

45:19.043 --> 45:20.705
Your friends who were here when you fell?

45:20.878 --> 45:23.313
I was on the phone when I fell. I was alone.

45:25.182 --> 45:26.878
I'm sorry. I thought that...

45:27.051 --> 45:29.145
I thought you said
that you had friends who were visiting.

45:31.555 --> 45:33.217
Some people were here.

45:34.158 --> 45:37.720
I wasn't stuck on my back
like a turtle all night.

45:41.565 --> 45:43.227
Poor Albert.

46:10.761 --> 46:14.755
Can't find the date The Catfish
are supposed to play.

46:15.232 --> 46:16.700
Just ask in town.

46:18.702 --> 46:22.660
Albert, so we were wondering
about the sandstone

46:22.740 --> 46:23.961
in the front yard,

46:24.041 --> 46:28.411
and if you'd be willing to sell it to us.

46:34.985 --> 46:38.319
I mean, if you wanted to get rid of it,
we'd take it off your hands.

46:42.593 --> 46:45.461
Have you talked to Kyle Yazzie lately?

46:45.830 --> 46:47.551
Is he gonna help you build your house?

46:47.631 --> 46:49.725
I think so.

46:50.568 --> 46:52.323
He's gonna let me use his backhoe, anyway.

46:52.403 --> 46:54.859
Well, you should dig up a garden
while you got the backhoe.

46:54.939 --> 46:56.293
We're not really planting a garden.

46:56.373 --> 46:59.930
Just desert plants
that we won't have to water too much.

47:00.010 --> 47:01.932
Russian olives, very nice.

47:02.012 --> 47:03.734
They make good shade trees.

47:03.814 --> 47:05.236
It'll be tough to care for our garden,

47:05.316 --> 47:07.872
since we can't really move
out here full-time,

47:07.952 --> 47:10.341
at least not until our daughter
gets through high school.

47:10.421 --> 47:11.912
Kyle's a nice young man.

47:12.923 --> 47:14.482
Plays a good banjo.

47:14.859 --> 47:16.828
His kids have been out to play on our land.

47:16.994 --> 47:18.758
I guess I trust him, all right.

47:19.663 --> 47:21.655
Can't always see the numbers.

47:26.837 --> 47:31.605
Well, I guess I'll give you that sandstone.

47:34.111 --> 47:36.012
We'd wanna pay you for it.

47:37.281 --> 47:39.841
It was the old schoolhouse, you know?

47:40.784 --> 47:42.685
From when the town was settled.

47:43.888 --> 47:48.883
They cut it from the massive
sandstone 'round here.

47:49.193 --> 47:52.561
They built that schoolhouse
before they built the church.

47:54.064 --> 47:58.126
Always thought the schoolhouse
must've been prettier than the church.

47:58.302 --> 47:59.895
I never thought it was a pretty church.

48:01.472 --> 48:03.794
We want native stone to build with.

48:03.874 --> 48:07.264
Railroad ties, things that fit in.

48:07.344 --> 48:09.767
We thought before we cut new stone,
we would look and see if we could

48:09.847 --> 48:10.968
find some that was already in blocks...

48:11.048 --> 48:13.483
My brother and I, he's dead now,

48:14.718 --> 48:19.486
when we bought this property in '66,
that stone was there.

48:21.492 --> 48:23.518
We built this house that year.

48:24.528 --> 48:25.723
Had it built.

48:29.733 --> 48:31.497
Still have things to finish.

48:32.603 --> 48:36.005
Like that back porch.

48:40.911 --> 48:44.541
76. Probably not gonna finish it.

48:54.058 --> 48:57.654
Okay. Yes, I'll give you that sandstone.

48:59.930 --> 49:03.020
You don't have to sell it
if you don't want to.

49:03.100 --> 49:08.095
It's just that Gina wants this new house
to be authentic.

49:10.774 --> 49:11.867
When do you need it?

49:13.944 --> 49:14.934
Well, as it happens,

49:15.579 --> 49:18.302
Ryan's brother has a flatbed truck
that we could use the week after next.

49:18.382 --> 49:21.147
So we just have to hire some help,
or find some help.

49:21.819 --> 49:22.809
Okay.

49:24.388 --> 49:26.755
Tentatively, you can have it.

49:28.392 --> 49:30.156
I wanna think a little more.

49:40.604 --> 49:45.062
Okay, well, if you change your mind,
no problem.

49:45.142 --> 49:46.764
Okay.

49:46.844 --> 49:49.700
Here. Let me get that door.

49:49.780 --> 49:50.770
Thank you.

49:57.855 --> 49:59.910
We can call you in a couple days?

49:59.990 --> 50:01.754
We'll leave you our numbers, too.

50:02.493 --> 50:03.984
Whatever's best for you.

50:05.829 --> 50:07.263
You know, it's a lot of rock.

50:08.899 --> 50:10.026
Look, quail.

50:10.467 --> 50:11.457
Yeah.

50:12.536 --> 50:14.027
I hear them all the time.

50:14.405 --> 50:17.034
Their call is... Is like... It goes...

50:20.844 --> 50:23.211
Sounds like, "How are you? How are you?"

50:24.381 --> 50:27.476
Then the answer, it goes...

50:30.554 --> 50:32.989
"I'm just fine. I'm just fine."

50:33.490 --> 50:34.480
Yeah.

50:40.531 --> 50:43.787
There's not gonna be enough
for a whole house, but a wall, maybe.

50:43.867 --> 50:46.769
We could plant some trees
where the rock pile is.

50:47.671 --> 50:49.159
Ryan'd help you.

50:49.239 --> 50:52.505
Honey, give him our card,
so that he has our numbers.

50:59.083 --> 51:01.882
All of those numbers will work.

51:02.286 --> 51:04.016
Your wife works for you.

51:06.123 --> 51:07.113
That's funny.

51:07.391 --> 51:09.121
No, she's the boss, actually.

51:10.260 --> 51:12.957
You'll come out to our place
when the weather gets warmer.

51:14.131 --> 51:15.622
And no more falling down.

51:17.101 --> 51:18.535
I don't plan to.

51:20.871 --> 51:24.205
And if you wanna sell, think of a good price.

51:24.741 --> 51:26.801
I don't know how much rock costs.

51:47.131 --> 51:48.121
I'm starving.

51:51.568 --> 51:53.833
God, you really weren't helping me at all.

51:55.639 --> 51:58.905
I was helping. I was in there.

51:59.309 --> 52:02.302
What, by repeatedly telling him
that he didn't have to sell to us?

52:04.148 --> 52:06.140
I just wanted to give him some wiggle room.

52:12.156 --> 52:13.818
It almost didn't feel worth it.

52:16.126 --> 52:17.958
I thought he knew he wasn't gonna use it.

52:21.999 --> 52:23.331
You wanna give it back?

52:30.307 --> 52:31.297
No.

52:32.209 --> 52:33.768
Someone else'd just take it.

52:38.348 --> 52:40.112
You sure he understood?

52:47.491 --> 52:49.960
We just have to think of something
really good to do with it.

52:50.627 --> 52:52.562
Then it won't feel so sad to take it.

56:50.934 --> 56:52.789
<i>...is a mysterious realm,</i>

56:52.869 --> 56:56.533
<i>full of danger and full of promise.</i>

56:58.442 --> 57:03.210
<i>A new frontier just waiting to be explored.</i>

59:13.743 --> 59:14.733
Hello.

59:24.588 --> 59:27.251
I've never done this before.

59:30.527 --> 59:31.859
Don't quite know where to start.

59:32.629 --> 59:36.031
Y'all wanna introduce yourselves?

59:36.533 --> 59:38.229
We all know each other.

59:44.708 --> 59:47.297
Wanna tell me what you already know
about school law?

59:47.377 --> 59:48.709
I don't think we know anything.

59:52.215 --> 59:53.205
Okay.

01:00:02.659 --> 01:00:05.561
Okay. Well, guess we'll just start
at the beginning.

01:00:09.733 --> 01:00:13.727
"The idea that the state must provide
a free public education

01:00:13.903 --> 01:00:18.898
"and that children can be required
to go to school goes back to 1642,

01:00:19.075 --> 01:00:21.840
"when the first such laws
were passed in Massachusetts.

01:00:22.445 --> 01:00:25.745
"By 1918, all states
had passed such legislation.

01:00:26.916 --> 01:00:30.648
"It's been said that 'students do not leave
their rights at the schoolhouse door.'

01:00:31.087 --> 01:00:35.149
"The United States Supreme Court has ruled
in a case called <i>Goss v. Lopez,</i>

01:00:35.325 --> 01:00:38.454
"which was decided in 1975,
that 'a school district

01:00:38.628 --> 01:00:40.927
"'cannot just expel a student

01:00:41.097 --> 01:00:43.498
"'without following
some type of procedure.'"

01:00:44.100 --> 01:00:46.831
That procedure is referred to
as "due process."

01:00:47.871 --> 01:00:52.028
The same with a criminal defendant
being entitled to due process

01:00:52.108 --> 01:00:53.997
before being locked up,

01:00:54.077 --> 01:00:56.366
the student is entitled to the same
before you can expel them.

01:00:56.446 --> 01:00:59.035
Can a student be expelled,
and then not let back in?

01:00:59.115 --> 01:01:01.641
Can a student say anything
he wants to me and just get...

01:01:12.062 --> 01:01:14.531
Hey. You stayin'?

01:01:14.898 --> 01:01:15.888
No.

01:01:20.570 --> 01:01:22.471
Are you registered for this class?

01:01:22.706 --> 01:01:24.641
No, I just saw people coming in.

01:01:34.184 --> 01:01:36.653
I have to drive all the way
back to Livingston tonight.

01:01:38.688 --> 01:01:40.884
Never done anything so stupid in my life.

01:01:41.725 --> 01:01:42.715
Livingston?

01:01:43.693 --> 01:01:45.389
Hey, do you know where I can get some food?

01:01:45.895 --> 01:01:49.423
Yeah, I could show you where the diner is.

01:01:49.733 --> 01:01:50.820
That'd be great.

01:01:50.900 --> 01:01:52.163
- Yeah.
- Thank you.

01:01:52.569 --> 01:01:53.559
Follow me.

01:02:31.241 --> 01:02:33.540
Took this job before I finished law school.

01:02:36.212 --> 01:02:40.206
I wanted any job.
I was afraid of my loans coming due.

01:02:43.153 --> 01:02:44.746
I didn't know where Belfry was.

01:02:45.622 --> 01:02:49.616
I guess I was thinking about Belgrade,
which is a lot closer.

01:02:51.795 --> 01:02:52.990
So stupid.

01:03:00.637 --> 01:03:01.798
Then I got a real job.

01:03:04.274 --> 01:03:06.903
And they're letting me do this
because they think it's funny.

01:03:08.411 --> 01:03:12.280
The pass is icy.
It takes me four hours to get here.

01:03:12.582 --> 01:03:14.517
It's gonna take me four hours to get back.

01:03:16.319 --> 01:03:18.185
I have to work in the morning.

01:03:24.260 --> 01:03:27.253
Did you tell me
how you ended up in this class?

01:03:27.931 --> 01:03:29.490
I just saw people going in.

01:03:33.369 --> 01:03:34.701
Did I make a fool of myself?

01:03:34.971 --> 01:03:37.770
No. It was interesting.

01:03:38.374 --> 01:03:40.639
I never knew a student had any rights.

01:03:41.177 --> 01:03:42.304
You gonna come back?

01:03:43.646 --> 01:03:44.773
When's it next?

01:03:45.815 --> 01:03:46.805
Thursday.

01:03:48.284 --> 01:03:51.516
Every Tuesday and Thursday for nine weeks.

01:03:51.688 --> 01:03:53.486
Well, I'm not signed up or anything.

01:03:55.658 --> 01:03:56.990
They're not gonna check.

01:03:59.329 --> 01:04:00.888
I don't even know school law.

01:04:02.699 --> 01:04:04.327
I'm gonna have to learn enough
to teach it every time.

01:04:04.901 --> 01:04:06.665
- Here ya go.
- Thank you.

01:04:08.037 --> 01:04:09.903
Sure you don't want anything?

01:04:22.085 --> 01:04:23.178
Where do you work?

01:04:23.887 --> 01:04:25.378
Out on the Hadden Ranch.

01:04:25.555 --> 01:04:28.684
Caring for the horses.
It's just a winter job.

01:04:29.325 --> 01:04:30.588
You want the other half?

01:04:31.261 --> 01:04:32.251
No.

01:04:35.798 --> 01:04:37.494
I'd show you, if you could stay longer.

01:04:38.401 --> 01:04:39.528
Show me what?

01:04:39.702 --> 01:04:41.671
The ranch. The horses.

01:04:46.376 --> 01:04:48.832
I have to get back.
I have to work in the morning.

01:04:48.912 --> 01:04:49.999
Sure.

01:04:50.079 --> 01:04:51.843
It's already a quarter to 10:00.
I have to go.

01:05:40.296 --> 01:05:41.286
Come on, Flynn.

01:07:50.093 --> 01:07:51.083
Hey, Flynn.

01:07:53.029 --> 01:07:54.019
Come.

01:09:16.345 --> 01:09:17.335
Okay.

01:09:19.314 --> 01:09:22.843
Key Supreme Court decisions
affecting school law.

01:09:26.322 --> 01:09:31.046
In the Supreme Court case from 1969,
10 students in Ohio were expelled

01:09:31.127 --> 01:09:34.461
for wearing arm bands as a form of protest
against the Vietnam War.

01:09:37.667 --> 01:09:39.988
The court said that was unconstitutional,

01:09:40.069 --> 01:09:44.734
for it violated their due process
and their freedom of speech.

01:09:49.045 --> 01:09:52.135
That was the <i>Tinker v. Des Moines</i> case.

01:09:52.215 --> 01:09:57.081
Is there a law that says teacher's pay has
to keep up with cost of living increases?

01:10:00.256 --> 01:10:04.694
I'm not a labor organizer,
but you should take that to your union.

01:10:04.927 --> 01:10:08.762
Can teachers get reserved parking spaces
for faculty only included in their...

01:10:19.976 --> 01:10:21.444
You going to the diner?

01:10:56.279 --> 01:10:59.374
Do you happen to know anyone in town
that could teach this class?

01:11:00.950 --> 01:11:02.418
I don't know anyone at all.

01:11:07.723 --> 01:11:09.123
How'd you break your arm?

01:11:09.792 --> 01:11:13.456
It's just my wrist. Riding an unbroken horse.

01:11:15.298 --> 01:11:17.665
Breaking horses? Is that part of your job?

01:11:18.467 --> 01:11:21.301
No. Just back home with my brothers.

01:11:23.439 --> 01:11:25.695
Yeah, when we were kids, my brothers and I,

01:11:25.775 --> 01:11:29.007
we'd sneak out and jump on
any ol' horse we could find.

01:11:29.312 --> 01:11:33.306
No saddle, no halter.
Just bring a piece of twine, that was it.

01:11:35.785 --> 01:11:37.340
Once broke my tailbone.

01:11:37.420 --> 01:11:39.514
Was too afraid to tell my mother
for two weeks.

01:11:41.324 --> 01:11:44.419
Had to sit on the edge of my chair in class.
It was awful.

01:11:45.695 --> 01:11:50.030
And I was so afraid I'd get outta law school
and be selling shoes.

01:13:53.556 --> 01:13:54.546
Hello.

01:14:00.463 --> 01:14:01.453
Sorry.

01:14:05.935 --> 01:14:06.925
Okay.

01:14:08.404 --> 01:14:10.236
Can I give you a ride to the diner?

01:14:12.408 --> 01:14:13.467
Not in the truck.

01:14:21.484 --> 01:14:23.476
Just... Just wait here.

01:15:06.829 --> 01:15:07.853
Really?

01:15:18.040 --> 01:15:19.895
I mean, it's been a while.

01:15:19.975 --> 01:15:21.238
Don't think about it.

01:16:39.955 --> 01:16:42.550
Cook wants to know
if that's your horse out back.

01:16:43.626 --> 01:16:44.713
It is.

01:16:44.793 --> 01:16:46.849
- Can he give it some water?
- Sure.

01:16:46.929 --> 01:16:48.717
- Thank you.
- Truck break down?

01:16:48.797 --> 01:16:50.789
Nope. Truck's all right.

01:17:01.310 --> 01:17:02.471
Here, have some fries.

01:17:09.652 --> 01:17:12.087
Why were you afraid of selling shoes?

01:17:14.156 --> 01:17:15.578
Have you ever sold shoes?

01:17:15.658 --> 01:17:18.150
I mean, why were you afraid
you couldn't get anything else?

01:17:19.094 --> 01:17:20.182
I don't know.

01:17:20.262 --> 01:17:24.687
Because my mom works in a school cafeteria,

01:17:24.767 --> 01:17:26.388
my sister in a hospital laundry.

01:17:26.468 --> 01:17:31.126
So, selling shoes is the nicest job

01:17:31.206 --> 01:17:33.368
a girl from my family's supposed to get.

01:17:36.211 --> 01:17:37.611
It all worked out.

01:17:39.381 --> 01:17:44.106
See, I'm a lawyer with a wonderful job
driving all the way to Belfry

01:17:44.186 --> 01:17:46.917
every 15 minutes until I lose my mind.

01:17:51.160 --> 01:17:54.358
It's 10:00.

01:17:55.130 --> 01:17:57.656
I'm not gonna be home until 2:00.

01:17:59.134 --> 01:18:04.226
And there's roaming cows in the road,
black ice just outside of Edgar.

01:18:04.306 --> 01:18:08.243
If I get through that, there's a roadblock
just outside of Livingston.

01:18:09.712 --> 01:18:14.203
Then I get to sleep for five hours,
take a shower, go to work at 8:00,

01:18:14.283 --> 01:18:16.639
do a bunch of crap nobody else wants to do

01:18:16.719 --> 01:18:18.813
and learn some more school law
tomorrow night.

01:18:19.655 --> 01:18:21.510
Leave work early the next day,

01:18:21.590 --> 01:18:25.425
and drive all the way back here,
with my eyes twitching.

01:18:33.769 --> 01:18:35.260
It was nice of you to bring the horse.

01:18:37.039 --> 01:18:38.701
Will you take me back to my car?

01:19:29.958 --> 01:19:30.948
Thank you.

01:19:38.300 --> 01:19:40.565
Thanks. Have a good night.

01:20:08.230 --> 01:20:09.220
Flynn!

01:21:56.905 --> 01:22:01.900
Apparently, Miss Travis found the drive
from Livingston too arduous,

01:22:02.577 --> 01:22:05.513
so I'll take over the class
for the rest of the term.

01:22:05.681 --> 01:22:09.938
I practice law here in town
and, as some of you know

01:22:10.018 --> 01:22:13.785
and the rest of you
will find out soon enough,

01:22:15.924 --> 01:22:18.450
I am recently divorced.

01:23:34.836 --> 01:23:37.431
<i>The type of place to be open at...</i>

01:23:45.647 --> 01:23:46.868
<i>What you're hearing now</i>

01:23:46.948 --> 01:23:51.886
<i>to some ears, may be hitting
those ears as irresponsible...</i>

01:27:10.385 --> 01:27:12.081
Excuse me.

01:27:12.654 --> 01:27:14.743
I wonder if you happen to know a lawyer
named Elizabeth Travis?

01:27:14.823 --> 01:27:15.813
No.

01:27:42.917 --> 01:27:45.173
Hi, Denise, it's Patty Gardener.

01:27:45.253 --> 01:27:48.690
Do you know a lawyer in town
named Elizabeth Travis?

01:27:49.758 --> 01:27:50.748
Sure.

01:27:52.861 --> 01:27:54.489
Denise knows everyone.

01:28:06.675 --> 01:28:09.110
She took a teaching job in Belgrade.

01:28:09.277 --> 01:28:12.179
Belfry. She's got another job here.

01:28:12.714 --> 01:28:15.240
We believe she has another job here in town.

01:29:41.536 --> 01:29:42.526
Hey.

01:29:44.839 --> 01:29:45.966
I drove over.

01:29:47.342 --> 01:29:48.901
Thought I was in the wrong place.

01:29:56.017 --> 01:29:58.350
You drove here?

01:30:00.822 --> 01:30:03.724
Feel sorry you stopped teaching the class.
I looked forward to it.

01:30:14.869 --> 01:30:17.158
I was gonna tell you on Tuesday
I asked for a replacement

01:30:17.238 --> 01:30:19.901
'cause of the drive.

01:30:21.843 --> 01:30:24.438
- That drive is pretty bad.
- Right.

01:30:31.619 --> 01:30:33.952
I don't mean to keep you
from getting to work or anything.

01:30:35.123 --> 01:30:37.752
I just knew if I didn't start driving,
I wasn't gonna see you again.

01:30:38.760 --> 01:30:40.820
Didn't want that.

01:30:41.596 --> 01:30:42.791
That's all.

01:30:59.747 --> 01:31:00.874
Okay.

01:31:06.554 --> 01:31:08.113
Well, I have to go feed now.

01:31:09.390 --> 01:31:11.256
Animals'll be wondering where I'm at.

01:36:13.194 --> 01:36:14.184
Hi.

01:36:18.800 --> 01:36:22.862
You must have some real pull,
getting in here on a Sunday.

01:36:23.104 --> 01:36:24.766
I guess you've had lunch, but...

01:36:25.640 --> 01:36:27.370
You got a shake in there?

01:36:27.608 --> 01:36:31.136
Chocolate one and a vanilla one.

01:36:31.779 --> 01:36:32.769
Vanilla.

01:36:33.881 --> 01:36:36.783
- There's a straw.
- Thank you. Thank you.

01:36:49.630 --> 01:36:50.825
It's good.

01:36:57.805 --> 01:37:01.139
So, how's it goin' in here?

01:37:03.678 --> 01:37:05.476
About what you'd expect.

01:37:07.014 --> 01:37:10.678
It's noisy. Lonely.

01:37:12.019 --> 01:37:14.318
No privacy.

01:37:16.824 --> 01:37:18.417
You know, my wife's gone.

01:37:19.827 --> 01:37:21.022
No, I didn't.

01:37:23.297 --> 01:37:26.756
After I stopped working
and started getting crazy,

01:37:27.335 --> 01:37:28.826
she got a pen pal.

01:37:29.804 --> 01:37:32.399
A guy in prison in Wyoming.

01:37:33.507 --> 01:37:35.874
They wrote back and forth all year.

01:37:36.844 --> 01:37:40.679
Then he got furloughed,
and she went to live with him.

01:37:41.315 --> 01:37:42.783
She sent me a letter.

01:37:42.884 --> 01:37:46.808
They're living on a farm,

01:37:46.888 --> 01:37:49.243
and they got 40 cats,

01:37:49.323 --> 01:37:52.350
and she's never been so happy.

01:37:53.861 --> 01:37:55.124
Can you believe that?

01:37:56.197 --> 01:37:59.153
She mailed me the letter from another town,
so I couldn't find her.

01:37:59.233 --> 01:38:00.788
Would you wanna find her?

01:38:00.868 --> 01:38:02.089
Yeah.

01:38:02.169 --> 01:38:04.695
No. I don't know.

01:38:06.574 --> 01:38:08.008
A guy in prison.

01:38:08.910 --> 01:38:11.903
I can't believe she found a guy in prison.

01:38:12.179 --> 01:38:14.444
I'm a guy in prison. What's wrong with me?

01:38:14.749 --> 01:38:16.149
What'd the guy do?

01:38:16.884 --> 01:38:18.477
She won't tell me.

01:38:19.754 --> 01:38:22.781
Probably an axe murderer. It's Wyoming.

01:38:30.531 --> 01:38:32.587
Did you get my letter?

01:38:32.667 --> 01:38:34.192
Yeah.

01:38:38.239 --> 01:38:39.327
You never wrote back to me.

01:38:39.407 --> 01:38:40.898
I meant to. I...

01:38:42.944 --> 01:38:44.432
I kept meaning to.

01:38:44.512 --> 01:38:47.914
Man, you wouldn't believe
how good mail feels.

01:38:50.918 --> 01:38:52.284
Think I told you that.

01:38:54.021 --> 01:38:55.614
I just didn't know what to say.

01:38:56.457 --> 01:39:00.087
That's the thing, is you don't have
to say anything special.

01:39:02.863 --> 01:39:05.924
Told you it's okay about what happened.

01:39:06.767 --> 01:39:08.861
You know, they would've got me anyway.

01:39:09.937 --> 01:39:11.269
I fucked up.

01:39:13.374 --> 01:39:14.774
And I mean this.

01:39:16.143 --> 01:39:18.612
You could talk about anything.

01:39:19.880 --> 01:39:21.109
Talk about the weather.

01:39:23.117 --> 01:39:24.585
Talk about your day.

01:39:25.453 --> 01:39:28.753
Just so you put it in an envelope,

01:39:30.057 --> 01:39:31.320
and put it in the mail.

01:39:36.430 --> 01:39:37.955
Doesn't have to be a tome.

01:39:42.069 --> 01:39:43.059
Okay.

01:40:10.531 --> 01:40:11.624
Awesome.

01:40:12.500 --> 01:40:13.627
Stop working.

01:40:16.070 --> 01:40:17.094
Dad.

01:40:17.838 --> 01:40:18.965
Can you get me a beer?

01:40:19.440 --> 01:40:20.430
Just kidding.

01:40:25.546 --> 01:40:27.742
What? Aw, man.

01:42:02.943 --> 01:42:06.937
<i>...if you don't have to drive,
well, then don't drive.</i>

01:42:14.121 --> 01:42:16.077
<i>I made a mistake.</i>

01:42:16.157 --> 01:42:18.854
<i>I left the house and... Whatever.
I go to the bank</i>

01:42:18.959 --> 01:42:22.225
<i>to cash this check, and I shouldn't have.
I should've stayed at home.</i>

01:42:26.901 --> 01:42:29.393
<i>Instead of this one, that would've been fine.</i>

01:42:35.509 --> 01:42:37.478
<i>It's been...</i>

01:42:52.593 --> 01:42:56.155
<i>It's colder if you're up a little north.</i>

01:43:03.170 --> 01:43:04.160
<i>I don't know.</i>

01:43:09.643 --> 01:43:11.805
<i>It doesn't matter how many...</i>

01:43:12.305 --> 01:43:18.332
