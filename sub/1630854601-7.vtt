WEBVTT

00:02.045 --> 00:04.787
When a new captain
steps on, things change.

00:04.787 --> 00:07.137
I run a boat how I run a boat.

00:07.137 --> 00:08.573
The captain has made
the schedule

00:08.573 --> 00:10.488
and asked for us to do
the schedule.

00:11.881 --> 00:12.969
I know.

00:12.969 --> 00:14.275
That pisses me off.

00:14.275 --> 00:15.928
You are going to be
for interior.

00:15.928 --> 00:17.278
- Got it.
- Full time.

00:17.278 --> 00:18.583
That's going
to solve our problem.

00:18.583 --> 00:19.671
I like it.

00:19.671 --> 00:21.369
Yeah, it works for me.

00:23.327 --> 00:24.807
We are professionals at this.

00:24.807 --> 00:25.982
You ready?

00:25.982 --> 00:27.505
Let's go.

00:27.505 --> 00:28.811
Oh, no.

00:28.811 --> 00:31.509
- Yes!
- Woo!

00:31.509 --> 00:33.163
Yeah, thanks.

00:33.163 --> 00:36.384
Just give me a----ing strong
drink because I've done my work.

00:36.384 --> 00:39.430
Ross, why are you
bubbling over there?

00:39.430 --> 00:41.606
I'm just----ing over it
and so----ing annoyed.

00:41.606 --> 00:45.045
Everybody literally is like,
she's so lazy.

00:45.045 --> 00:46.307
I'm lazy?

00:46.307 --> 00:48.265
Are you----ing kidding me?

00:48.265 --> 00:51.225
You have this charter
to prove to me

00:51.225 --> 00:53.009
that you're in it to win it.

00:53.009 --> 00:54.837
If you don't,
you'll be off the boat.

00:54.837 --> 00:58.101
I don't understand.
Am I going----ing crazy?

00:58.101 --> 01:00.582
I have one charter to prove it.

01:00.582 --> 01:01.626
What do I need to prove?

01:11.201 --> 01:13.682
Get out, Alissa.
I'm dead-ass serious.

01:13.682 --> 01:16.076
I'm having... get out!
Seriously, please.

01:16.076 --> 01:17.381
Please get out.

01:17.381 --> 01:18.513
I'm pulling Captain Sandy's
sheets.

01:18.513 --> 01:19.731
Please, Alissa.
Please get out.

01:19.731 --> 01:21.081
Go cry in a different room,

01:21.081 --> 01:22.734
I'm pulling Captain
Sandy's sheets.

01:22.734 --> 01:24.345
Please, I've been here and
you're just sitting there.

01:24.345 --> 01:25.694
- Please get out.
- Baby, I'm pulling sheets.

01:25.694 --> 01:27.174
I'm not.
I'm working.

01:27.174 --> 01:28.349
- God damn, Alissa.
- I'm not sitting anywhere.

01:28.349 --> 01:29.350
I don't know what's going on.

01:29.350 --> 01:30.568
What Captain Sandy said to her,

01:30.568 --> 01:32.135
but seeing her
crying and upset,

01:32.135 --> 01:33.876
I feel bad for her.

01:33.876 --> 01:37.314
But I'm just trying to quietly
collect my sheets and dip out.

01:37.314 --> 01:38.750
You have an issue and...

01:38.750 --> 01:41.536
God,----ing yeah, I do have
a----ing issue.

01:41.536 --> 01:43.581
Well, I don't have one and
I don't want one, so...

01:43.581 --> 01:45.105
Oh, God.

01:47.194 --> 01:48.804
- Good morning.
- Morning.

01:55.941 --> 01:57.291
Bingo.
Oh, yes.

01:57.291 --> 01:58.509
Bingo. What's his name-o,
I think.

01:58.509 --> 01:59.597
Yes.

02:01.860 --> 02:03.645
- Hey.
- Hey.

02:07.823 --> 02:09.259
Yeah.

02:16.658 --> 02:17.833
Mm-hmm.

02:24.970 --> 02:27.364
You know I don't like that.

02:27.364 --> 02:29.671
I actually have quite
low nipples, I've decided.

02:29.671 --> 02:31.151
I'm going to see if
I can get them augmented.

02:31.151 --> 02:34.154
What is this pelt--
oh, that's fine.

02:35.242 --> 02:37.331
Love fitted sheets.

02:37.331 --> 02:39.942
Make life so much easier.

02:39.942 --> 02:42.031
Oh, mother----er!

02:42.031 --> 02:44.251
It's the 850th time.

02:44.251 --> 02:45.513
How'd you go, Ross?

02:45.513 --> 02:46.601
Fantastic.

02:46.601 --> 02:48.385
Lovely day to be
as hungover as I am.

02:51.258 --> 02:53.956
He was like this.

03:00.571 --> 03:03.357
I can----ing hear you,
you know?

03:03.357 --> 03:06.142
It's just, like, Jesus Christ,
but I get my headphones.

03:06.142 --> 03:07.404
But I leave them, bro.

03:07.404 --> 03:09.493
You guys want to have sex,
let me know,

03:09.493 --> 03:11.147
and I'm going to walk away.

03:11.147 --> 03:12.148
Thanks, bro.

03:12.148 --> 03:13.889
Man.

03:13.889 --> 03:15.151
We've got to find somewhere else
on the boat to do it, though.

03:15.151 --> 03:16.848
Worthwhile bilge.

03:16.848 --> 03:18.459
There's no room.

03:18.459 --> 03:20.461
<i>- Captain, Captain, Fraser.
- Go ahead, Fraser.</i>

03:20.461 --> 03:22.289
<i>Do you have two minutes
I can chat with you?</i>

03:22.289 --> 03:24.291
<i>Yeah, sure.
I'm in my cabin.</i>

03:24.291 --> 03:25.292
Okay, I'm going to cabins.

03:25.292 --> 03:26.815
It's just an ADD moment.

03:26.815 --> 03:29.470
I'm going to have Camille
on the early shift

03:29.470 --> 03:31.472
as opposed to the lates

03:31.472 --> 03:34.649
so I can be with her
technically all day.

03:34.649 --> 03:38.348
So there's no chance there
to be any sort of animosity

03:38.348 --> 03:39.567
between the crew
when I'm not around.

03:39.567 --> 03:41.177
Thank you.
Mad respect.

03:41.177 --> 03:42.744
- Thank you so much.
- No, honestly.

03:42.744 --> 03:44.920
Honestly, it means
so much to me. Thank you.

03:44.920 --> 03:47.923
Here's the day.
Let's see what we've got.

03:47.923 --> 03:49.577
Ross, Fraser, and Rachel,

03:49.577 --> 03:51.100
let's meet in the crew mass
for a preference sheet meeting.

03:51.100 --> 03:53.015
<i>Copy. Thank you.</i>

03:53.015 --> 03:54.277
You know, when they build boats,

03:54.277 --> 03:55.322
they always start
with the staircase.

03:55.322 --> 03:56.758
<i>Coming, Captain.</i>

03:56.758 --> 03:58.673
I don't think they did
that with this boat.

03:58.673 --> 04:00.979
Charter number four,
primary Karan Bakshi,

04:00.979 --> 04:04.331
his owner of multiple businesses
in the northern Virginia area.

04:04.331 --> 04:06.724
He and his wife, Kamna,
travel together often

04:06.724 --> 04:08.509
with their group of
closely knit friends

04:08.509 --> 04:10.337
and never leave home
without their hookah,

04:10.337 --> 04:12.817
which they want
to smoke each night

04:12.817 --> 04:14.166
along with some cigars.

04:14.166 --> 04:15.516
And I have cigar knowledge,

04:15.516 --> 04:16.604
so I'd be delighted
to order some in.

04:16.604 --> 04:18.170
They like their food hot.

04:18.170 --> 04:20.042
Spice level seven out of ten.

04:20.042 --> 04:21.609
I can provide that.

04:21.609 --> 04:23.306
They also request a surprise
party for the primary's wife

04:23.306 --> 04:26.657
and a Bollywood dinner party
on their last night on board.

04:26.657 --> 04:28.572
I'm so excited to have
these guests on board.

04:28.572 --> 04:30.313
I studied in India
for a couple months,

04:30.313 --> 04:32.097
mainly Kerala and Goa.

04:32.097 --> 04:34.404
Had to take a little bit
of Hindi, which is awesome.

04:34.404 --> 04:36.276
"Dhani Bad," which is thank you.

04:36.276 --> 04:37.886
"Apsi Nil Kar Chalaga."

04:37.886 --> 04:39.931
That means it's very
nice to meet you.

04:39.931 --> 04:41.281
This is going to be epic.

04:41.281 --> 04:42.499
Guests would like
a beach barbecue

04:42.499 --> 04:44.196
where the sand
is soft and light.

04:44.196 --> 04:47.156
And that's going to be up to you
to find soft and light sand.

04:47.156 --> 04:48.549
Okay, thank you.

04:48.549 --> 04:49.941
We're doing it a
little differently.

04:49.941 --> 04:51.378
We're departing the dock by ten,

04:51.378 --> 04:55.164
and then you will go
and get them at noon.

04:55.164 --> 04:56.905
I'm going off the dock early

04:56.905 --> 04:58.559
because it's nice
to arrive by boat.

04:58.559 --> 04:59.821
Like that makes you go,

04:59.821 --> 05:02.258
"wow, this massive yacht,
all the toys,

05:02.258 --> 05:03.738
the crew are happy to see them."

05:03.738 --> 05:05.435
Feels like total
James Bond arrival.

05:05.435 --> 05:06.828
That's pretty awesome, right?

05:06.828 --> 05:08.482
- Thank you so much.
- Okay, thank you very much.

05:08.482 --> 05:10.353
I reckon we're due some
pretty horrible guests

05:10.353 --> 05:12.921
because they've all been
quite nice up till now.

05:12.921 --> 05:14.531
Yeah, let's be positive.

05:14.531 --> 05:16.577
We're going to have amazing
people this whole season.

05:16.577 --> 05:18.405
- If someone is like us...
- Let's manifest it.

05:18.405 --> 05:20.320
I'm so tired.

05:20.320 --> 05:22.800
It's romantic up here,
isn't it?

05:29.546 --> 05:31.766
Ugly pointy fold.

05:35.509 --> 05:37.946
Cabin's done.
Laundry's pretty much done.

05:37.946 --> 05:39.904
Oh, please, come here.

05:39.904 --> 05:43.168
I'm an organizational
gal pal today.

05:43.168 --> 05:45.388
I love a good hug hug.

05:45.388 --> 05:47.216
- I'm so----ing tired.
- I'm so tired.

05:47.216 --> 05:48.435
We need to go to bed.

05:48.435 --> 05:49.610
Don't go.

05:49.610 --> 05:51.394
I feel like a big night
from last night.

05:51.394 --> 05:52.787
Wait, I'm going to
leave you alone.

05:52.787 --> 05:54.876
All right, I'll see
you later, goodnight.

05:56.791 --> 05:58.619
People just want to
go to bed too early

05:58.619 --> 06:00.403
and I don't appreciate it.

06:11.066 --> 06:12.981
Where are the lights
in this bitch?

06:12.981 --> 06:14.809
What is this?

06:14.809 --> 06:16.506
Thank you for making me laugh.

06:16.506 --> 06:18.029
My pleasure.

06:18.029 --> 06:19.683
My least favorite part.

06:21.859 --> 06:23.383
Oh, bloody hell.

06:23.383 --> 06:24.819
What have you done?

06:24.819 --> 06:27.212
I just put a crease in where
there wasn't one before.

06:27.212 --> 06:28.910
Brilliant.

06:28.910 --> 06:30.825
I've got one more
white shirt to iron

06:30.825 --> 06:33.218
and then everyone's going to
be looking just spiffy.

06:33.218 --> 06:34.742
- Proud of you.
- Thank you.

06:34.742 --> 06:37.832
- You're proud of her?
- Very. Very.

06:37.832 --> 06:41.444
Everybody's busting
their butt today.

06:41.444 --> 06:43.533
I see her working harder

06:43.533 --> 06:46.580
and I'm kind of almost
hopeful for the first time

06:46.580 --> 06:48.016
that she'll get it together.

06:48.016 --> 06:49.452
Thank you.

06:49.452 --> 06:51.411
- I cleaned the bag too.
- Oh, thank you.

06:51.411 --> 06:52.803
Interior, interior, Ben.

06:52.803 --> 06:54.370
It looks like we've got
provisions on the dock.

06:54.370 --> 06:55.502
Copy for Rachel.

06:55.502 --> 06:56.981
Okay, that's galley.

06:56.981 --> 06:59.462
Eat me. I can write it in seven
different languages.

06:59.462 --> 07:01.029
Put this inside.

07:03.118 --> 07:05.381
Evian's up here.

07:05.381 --> 07:06.513
Take this----ing sh--.

07:09.211 --> 07:10.473
How do you feel about lates?

07:10.473 --> 07:11.822
I didn't mind.

07:11.822 --> 07:13.607
Yeah, you and Alissa get
on better than we do,

07:13.607 --> 07:15.043
so it'll be good for us to
be separated for a while.

07:15.043 --> 07:15.957
We work together.

07:15.957 --> 07:17.524
All right, all crew, all crew.

07:17.524 --> 07:18.699
We're going to prepare
to get off the dock.

07:18.699 --> 07:20.483
Copy that.
Two greens.

07:20.483 --> 07:21.528
One at front, one at back.

07:21.528 --> 07:22.833
- Okay.
<i>- All crew.</i>

07:22.833 --> 07:25.096
Good to go.
Let's get out of here.

07:25.096 --> 07:26.184
Go, go, go.

07:26.184 --> 07:27.534
Stern line is off.

07:27.534 --> 07:28.752
Pull it up.

07:30.580 --> 07:31.799
We're moving.

07:31.799 --> 07:34.192
Now that Camille's
in the interior,

07:34.192 --> 07:37.152
like, we don't really notice it.

07:39.284 --> 07:41.417
Hideous.
Don't like it.

07:41.417 --> 07:44.725
I think it's okay.
We're fine.

07:45.813 --> 07:48.555
Okay, go ahead with
your bad self.

07:48.555 --> 07:50.861
Swing that stern,
Sandy Susu.

07:50.861 --> 07:52.994
All clear of the dock.
All clear of the dock.

07:52.994 --> 07:55.170
Excellent work, deck crew.
Thank you very much.

07:55.170 --> 07:58.303
Just watch me a lot and
just see how I do things.

07:58.303 --> 07:59.304
There's a reason
for most things.

07:59.304 --> 08:00.915
Right.

08:00.915 --> 08:02.220
Just slowing down, so I think
we'll be anchored here.

08:02.220 --> 08:04.832
Okay, anchor down,
three in the water.

08:09.053 --> 08:10.315
Captain, that's three
in the water line.

08:10.315 --> 08:11.795
<i>Thank you.</i>

08:11.795 --> 08:13.405
You two do want to do a slide.
Katie and I do a...

08:13.405 --> 08:15.277
- Done.
- Jetski.

08:15.277 --> 08:16.496
Let's go.

08:17.366 --> 08:18.759
Good thing I showered today.

08:18.759 --> 08:20.456
I think we're all
very happy for that.

08:20.456 --> 08:21.762
Come down, please, my boy.

08:21.762 --> 08:23.807
- A little bit down.
- Coming down.

08:25.156 --> 08:26.375
Okay.

08:26.375 --> 08:27.985
Thank you.

08:29.465 --> 08:32.120
- I've got a voice in my head.
- Not another one, darling.

08:33.991 --> 08:36.254
It's not perfection, but
it's definitely ironed.

08:36.254 --> 08:37.821
- Hey, mate.
- All right, how you doing?

08:37.821 --> 08:39.649
<i>You're clear to grab
the guests.</i>

08:39.649 --> 08:41.825
- Copy that.
- Bye, guys.

08:41.825 --> 08:45.960
We're going to allocate specific
napkins for the champagne

08:45.960 --> 08:49.050
because we can't be taking them
from the few sets that we have.

08:51.095 --> 08:52.096
Beautiful.

08:54.011 --> 08:55.535
Hey, guys.
This is Ben.

08:55.535 --> 08:57.101
- Hi, Ben.
- I'm Ross.

08:57.101 --> 08:58.494
Nice to meet you.

08:58.494 --> 08:59.713
We're going to get
you guys on board,

08:59.713 --> 09:00.844
and then we're going
to hit the big boat.

09:00.844 --> 09:02.237
Come on.
Where's the smile?

09:02.237 --> 09:03.673
That's the way.

09:04.718 --> 09:06.154
Rachel, Rachel.
Guests incoming.

09:06.154 --> 09:07.634
All right. Let's all line up,
ladies and gents.

09:10.550 --> 09:12.856
What a way to arrive.
Very James Bond.

09:12.856 --> 09:14.336
- Hello, guys.
- Hi.

09:14.336 --> 09:15.859
We'll get you guys off to the
back here.

09:15.859 --> 09:17.078
- It's a bit more stable.
- All right, guys.

09:17.078 --> 09:18.340
You can follow me up
to the aft deck.

09:18.340 --> 09:19.646
Hi.

09:19.646 --> 09:20.647
Sandy, nice to meet you.

09:20.647 --> 09:21.865
Nice to meet you.

09:21.865 --> 09:23.345
How was it coming up
on your tender?

09:23.345 --> 09:25.695
- Fraser, nice to meet you.
- Hi, nice to meet you.

09:26.566 --> 09:28.872
- Vivek.
- Vivek.

09:28.872 --> 09:33.616
Rachel, nice to meet you.

09:33.616 --> 09:34.704
Thank you.

09:34.704 --> 09:36.967
Let's get this party started.

09:38.665 --> 09:40.536
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

09:40.536 --> 09:41.842
Welcome aboard.

09:41.842 --> 09:43.844
Fraser is going to show
you around the boat.

09:43.844 --> 09:45.280
Please do follow me.

09:45.280 --> 09:46.847
We've got the sun deck
where I'm sure

09:46.847 --> 09:49.545
you'll be spending
lots of your time.

09:49.545 --> 09:51.112
I'm not too sure.

09:51.112 --> 09:52.461
We would like to do it in a
couple of different places.

09:52.461 --> 09:54.376
Yeah, absolutely.

09:54.376 --> 09:57.074
Oh, my God.
It's got a person in it. 100%.

09:57.074 --> 09:59.860
This is the favorite
space on board.

09:59.860 --> 10:01.818
If your hookah
doesn't need wind,

10:01.818 --> 10:03.777
I think this will be a
good spot too.

10:03.777 --> 10:06.606
This is our primary suite.

10:14.744 --> 10:16.180
I'm going to do margarita.

10:16.180 --> 10:18.574
Yes!

10:18.574 --> 10:19.967
Do you want to get you
something besides champagne?

10:19.967 --> 10:23.274
Yes.
I'll do a spicy margarita.

10:24.928 --> 10:25.755
Yep.

10:25.755 --> 10:26.974
Let's get the party started.

10:26.974 --> 10:28.671
Can I get a shot of
the Don Julio?

10:29.759 --> 10:31.761
I'm going to do margarita.

10:33.371 --> 10:37.375
They seem demanding and
they're drinking like fish.

10:37.375 --> 10:39.073
Okay, you're doing
so many shots, right?

10:39.073 --> 10:40.030
Chilled shots.

10:40.030 --> 10:41.684
Do you have any flavored vodka?

10:41.684 --> 10:42.903
- We need a chaser.
- Excuse me, excuse me.

10:42.903 --> 10:44.252
I'll have the margarita, too.

10:44.252 --> 10:47.342
These guys are going
to rip our asses apart.

10:47.342 --> 10:48.691
I'm watching.

10:51.694 --> 10:56.917
I want food.

10:56.917 --> 10:58.701
What time is the lunch?

10:58.701 --> 11:01.312
I'm sorry, I'm hungry.
I want food.

11:01.312 --> 11:02.705
Hey, chef.
What platters do you need?

11:02.705 --> 11:06.927
For the chicken, fish
and chorizo.

11:06.927 --> 11:08.842
I just need the platters
that are kind of dipped.

11:08.842 --> 11:10.626
- Yeah.
- All right, perfect.

11:10.626 --> 11:13.063
For today's lunch, we're going
to go with a Mexican theme.

11:13.063 --> 11:14.369
That's more my palate.

11:14.369 --> 11:16.632
And the guests spice level
is quite high.

11:16.632 --> 11:18.503
That means murder sauce.

11:18.503 --> 11:20.288
It's where you're
screaming my name,

11:20.288 --> 11:22.159
and I don't mean it
in a sexual way.

11:24.335 --> 11:25.423
Yeah, man.

11:25.423 --> 11:27.034
Tony and Katie, if you
want to switch

11:27.034 --> 11:28.252
into your swim gear
and come back.

11:28.252 --> 11:29.471
Okay.

11:43.877 --> 11:45.139
Anyway, I'm going to go
and put like...

11:45.139 --> 11:46.749
All right, thank you.

11:46.749 --> 11:49.709
I should always remember to wear
these, but I always forget.

11:49.709 --> 11:51.711
Get your margaritas here, boys.

11:51.711 --> 11:53.495
Yeah!

11:55.149 --> 11:56.367
Let's do starter
plates just first.

11:56.367 --> 11:57.804
Okay.

11:57.804 --> 11:59.457
You're going to have the
main plates on our bar here.

11:59.457 --> 12:00.589
Okay, perfect.

12:00.589 --> 12:01.895
And I'll be changing them out.

12:01.895 --> 12:03.461
Camille, she's working
a little harder,

12:03.461 --> 12:04.462
and I'm noticing it,

12:04.462 --> 12:05.725
and I'm so appreciative.

12:05.725 --> 12:06.769
- How are you feeling?
- Good.

12:06.769 --> 12:08.336
I'm very excited to be here.

12:08.336 --> 12:12.122
That's a huge sense of
responsibility in oneself

12:12.122 --> 12:13.950
to realize that
you've----ed up

12:13.950 --> 12:14.951
and to change your ways.

12:14.951 --> 12:16.518
And I love that about her.

12:16.518 --> 12:18.999
I'm going to go rinse this off,
because it needs a rinse.

12:24.700 --> 12:26.528
Like, I don't care about
the pieces of meat,

12:26.528 --> 12:27.790
what I care about is

12:27.790 --> 12:28.791
is I'm like, can you go
and get changed

12:28.791 --> 12:30.097
so we can get changed?

12:30.097 --> 12:31.272
Yeah, let's just say how
it is, though.

12:31.272 --> 12:32.621
Everyone's got to be on
the same level,

12:32.621 --> 12:34.449
otherwise you don't respect
their work ethic.

12:36.843 --> 12:40.760
Mango margaritas?

12:40.760 --> 12:42.413
Yay!

12:42.413 --> 12:44.502
Ross, you want to go change, and
I'll stay down here with Ben.

12:44.502 --> 12:46.156
Thank you.

12:57.951 --> 12:59.126
Yeah, I can bust a move.

12:59.126 --> 13:01.084
I like being the fun captain.

13:01.084 --> 13:03.478
So why not have a dance
party with the guests?

13:07.351 --> 13:09.005
- No, we're hungry!
- We haven't had lunch.

13:09.005 --> 13:11.747
- What about food?
- We need to have lunch.

13:11.747 --> 13:13.836
Where's the food?

13:13.836 --> 13:15.838
Lunch is at three.

13:15.838 --> 13:18.014
Why am I so sh--
at folding everything?

13:18.014 --> 13:19.537
You should see how badly
I make beds.

13:19.537 --> 13:20.538
It's just awful.

13:20.538 --> 13:21.539
We'll get there.

13:21.539 --> 13:23.367
Woo!

13:23.367 --> 13:24.716
Oh my God,
three days of this.

13:24.716 --> 13:26.544
I can't do it.

13:26.544 --> 13:27.850
Hey.

13:27.850 --> 13:29.678
You're always so excited
to see me.

13:29.678 --> 13:30.766
- I know.
- I love it.

13:30.766 --> 13:32.986
You're in your whites.

13:32.986 --> 13:34.378
<i>All crew, all crew.</i>

13:34.378 --> 13:36.380
We will be departing
this anchorage

13:36.380 --> 13:38.643
and heading to
a harbor anchorage.

13:38.643 --> 13:41.211
<i>Copy that.</i>

13:41.211 --> 13:43.474
All right. I'm going to have
you on communications.

13:43.474 --> 13:44.693
- Yeah.
- I'll have a tequila.

13:44.693 --> 13:46.129
Sure.

13:46.129 --> 13:47.739
You can start hauling
whenever you are ready.

13:47.739 --> 13:49.045
Pulling anchor.

13:49.045 --> 13:52.092
- Five shackles on deck.
- Five shackles on deck.

13:52.092 --> 13:54.007
Anchor change.
Straight up and down.

13:54.007 --> 13:55.225
Anchor's at the waterline.

13:55.225 --> 13:56.618
And say, bringing
the anchor home.

13:56.618 --> 13:58.925
- Anchor's home.
<i>- Thank you. Excellent work.</i>

13:58.925 --> 14:00.665
- Say thank you.
- Thank you.

14:00.665 --> 14:02.624
Thank you, guys.

14:04.756 --> 14:06.846
Let's go, ladies.

14:06.846 --> 14:08.195
I'm hungry.

14:10.023 --> 14:12.025
Holy [bleep].

14:12.025 --> 14:13.765
I'm, like, excited
for the food.

14:13.765 --> 14:14.766
I think I'm ready for some food.

14:14.766 --> 14:16.029
Yes.

14:16.029 --> 14:17.421
Has anyone checked
Sundeck recently?

14:17.421 --> 14:18.945
I just want to make sure
there's towels there

14:18.945 --> 14:20.120
in case people go into jacuzzi.

14:20.120 --> 14:21.512
Oh, yeah, I know.
There is towels.

14:21.512 --> 14:23.036
But I'm going to go
and double check.

14:23.036 --> 14:24.341
Just to make sure.

14:24.341 --> 14:26.126
I'm literally
starving right now.

14:26.126 --> 14:27.867
So the food is on its way up.

14:27.867 --> 14:31.871
I am hungry.

14:31.871 --> 14:33.960
I am hungry!

14:33.960 --> 14:34.961
They are crazy.

14:34.961 --> 14:36.571
They are impatient.

14:36.571 --> 14:39.879
Like, this one girl's
screaming, I'm hungry.

14:39.879 --> 14:41.315
That's just an idea of what
we've put on board.

14:42.403 --> 14:43.491
Yeah.

14:44.666 --> 14:46.407
If lunch is a little late,
I own it.

14:46.407 --> 14:49.279
But it's not.
So shut the [bleep] up.

14:49.279 --> 14:51.542
I'm in chef mode.

14:51.542 --> 14:52.543
Oh, bitch.

14:52.543 --> 14:53.544
These are hot.

14:53.544 --> 14:54.589
And what is this?

14:54.589 --> 14:55.807
This is mahi mahi.

14:55.807 --> 14:57.940
Let's, u...

14:57.940 --> 14:59.028
Thank you very much, Tony.

14:59.028 --> 15:00.943
- We're waiting.
- Yeah.

15:00.943 --> 15:02.945
- What is this?
- Pork chorizo.

15:02.945 --> 15:04.468
Care for some mahi mahi, sir?

15:04.468 --> 15:05.600
Oh, yes, please.

15:05.600 --> 15:07.210
Food is here, guys.

15:07.210 --> 15:09.647
I'm going to bother you for
the hottest sauce that you have.

15:09.647 --> 15:11.780
I'm starving
I need food right now.

15:12.999 --> 15:13.956
I'm starving.

15:13.956 --> 15:15.915
And this is a...

15:15.915 --> 15:18.004
Queso fundido.

15:21.137 --> 15:23.313
Melted Juan-hockin' cheese.

15:23.313 --> 15:27.665
- Chorizo.
- Oh, yes.

15:27.665 --> 15:29.450
All right.

15:30.451 --> 15:31.800
Please try this hot sauce.

15:31.800 --> 15:32.801
Yes, thank you.

15:32.801 --> 15:33.845
Rachel has just prepared it.

15:33.845 --> 15:36.718
- And this is?
- Tri-tip.

15:36.718 --> 15:38.241
Yeah, I don't like it.

15:42.158 --> 15:43.159
I'm being honest,
I was expecting

15:43.159 --> 15:45.379
a little more higher quality.

15:45.379 --> 15:46.946
I mean, the food is bland.

15:46.946 --> 15:48.338
Chef will be heading up.

15:48.338 --> 15:49.818
She'll be able to answer
any questions about

15:49.818 --> 15:52.516
any of the dishes
we have on the table.

15:55.258 --> 15:56.999
So we need to tell them
she's coming out right now.

15:56.999 --> 15:58.783
- Hello.
- Hi.

15:58.783 --> 16:00.916
- Rachel. Hi.
- Hi.

16:00.916 --> 16:03.527
I actually have a homemade
scotch bonnet hot sauce

16:03.527 --> 16:05.355
that I do make.
All the sauces.

16:05.355 --> 16:07.662
And then you also have a local
hot sauce, which is fun too.

16:07.662 --> 16:09.359
It's the yellow one
that the sauce has.

16:09.359 --> 16:11.187
- We love it.
- We love that one.

16:11.187 --> 16:14.756
So we definitely like our food

16:14.756 --> 16:16.584
to be more hot, more spicy.

16:18.673 --> 16:20.109
Okay.
I'll add more spice.

16:20.109 --> 16:21.458
Yeah.

16:21.458 --> 16:24.157
Come to find out
my spicy gets called bland.

16:24.157 --> 16:25.549
How dare you.

16:25.549 --> 16:27.203
Well, I'll make
sure I'll turn on my hot,

16:27.203 --> 16:28.552
I've been told no lately.

16:28.552 --> 16:30.293
So I'm happy
to have you on board.

16:30.293 --> 16:32.817
- Yes.
- You know it.

16:32.817 --> 16:34.515
Now I have carte blanche.

16:34.515 --> 16:38.127
And that means I'm going
to burn your asshole off.

16:38.127 --> 16:39.911
- Enjoy.
- Thank you.

16:39.911 --> 16:42.088
Thank you.

16:42.088 --> 16:43.567
The only thing I
liked was chorizo.

16:43.567 --> 16:45.874
- I do not like anything else.
- Chorizo's good.

16:47.223 --> 16:48.224
That's bad.

16:48.224 --> 16:49.312
They're complaining.

16:49.312 --> 16:50.531
- All day.
- Yeah.

16:50.531 --> 16:51.836
I don't like it.

16:51.836 --> 16:53.012
I think the only thing
I want to do is salad.

16:53.012 --> 16:59.844
I just need a fresh plate.

16:59.844 --> 17:01.455
The food is bland.

17:01.455 --> 17:03.457
I did not like it one wee bit.

17:03.457 --> 17:05.328
- That's bad.
- Let's go.

17:08.244 --> 17:09.463
There's the Pitons right there.

17:13.162 --> 17:15.773
Look, that looks amazing.
I want to snorkel over there.

17:15.773 --> 17:17.384
Can we talk to
the captain, please?

17:17.384 --> 17:18.820
Anchor's ready to drop.

17:18.820 --> 17:22.302
85 meters.
Anchor down. Anchor down.

17:24.086 --> 17:25.087
Cap that six at the waterline.

17:25.087 --> 17:26.262
Great. Thank you.

17:26.262 --> 17:28.743
- Look at the view.
- Mountain peak.

17:28.743 --> 17:29.831
Wow. So pretty.

17:29.831 --> 17:31.659
Katie, you can take
your break now.

17:31.659 --> 17:32.747
I will as well.

17:32.747 --> 17:33.704
Are you going to get
on the jetskis?

17:33.704 --> 17:35.271
- We can do that.
- Okay, cool.

17:35.271 --> 17:38.013
Have you used one on
this one before?

17:38.013 --> 17:39.101
- Do you know what, babe?
- Yes.

17:39.101 --> 17:41.582
Just knowing that
you're interior

17:41.582 --> 17:44.150
already makes me
feel so much better.

17:44.150 --> 17:45.629
So much better.

17:45.629 --> 17:47.153
To be honest, it makes me feel
a lot better, too.

17:47.153 --> 17:50.939
And then we'll get
into blues when we can.

17:50.939 --> 17:52.332
All right.

17:53.159 --> 17:54.508
Okay, there we go.

17:57.946 --> 18:00.383
- Woo!
- Yeah boy!

18:06.607 --> 18:07.869
This is why I did
not go with them,

18:07.869 --> 18:10.045
because they're
all freaking crazy.

18:10.045 --> 18:11.786
All right, coming in hot.

18:23.232 --> 18:26.366
Work Ross is amazing.
We have this insane connection.

18:26.366 --> 18:29.369
But the reason why Ross
and I haven't had sex yet

18:29.369 --> 18:32.067
is after going out,
it's just like he's sloppy.

18:32.067 --> 18:33.155
He's drunk.

18:33.155 --> 18:34.417
I'm going to grab on everybody.

18:34.417 --> 18:36.202
I can't have him be
acting like that

18:36.202 --> 18:39.248
and then sleeping with me,
it makes me look like an idiot.

18:46.995 --> 18:48.301
Yeah.

18:49.650 --> 18:50.912
We're just going to take
off the bracelet,

18:50.912 --> 18:52.043
and then that's all.

18:55.134 --> 18:56.178
I have a bruise on my knee.

18:56.178 --> 18:57.353
- Hey, babe.
- Hey.

18:57.353 --> 18:59.181
Did you give cabin's
a check?

18:59.181 --> 19:00.226
Uh-uh.

19:00.226 --> 19:01.749
Oh, sh---.

19:01.749 --> 19:03.533
I can't----ing hear
anything on my radio.

19:03.533 --> 19:04.926
Say something, because
I'm getting other people's,

19:04.926 --> 19:06.101
but I'm not getting
anyone else's.

19:06.101 --> 19:07.755
Doing my job to the fullest,

19:07.755 --> 19:11.715
and then turning around and
begging Camille to do her job,

19:11.715 --> 19:13.804
it's like----ing a slap
in the face.

19:13.804 --> 19:15.328
- Camille.
- No, I'm getting it.

19:15.328 --> 19:16.590
She likes a seal.

19:16.590 --> 19:18.983
She wants a feel.

19:18.983 --> 19:22.509
She's back to the same
attitude, same work ethic,.

19:22.509 --> 19:24.250
How am I supposed
to manage somebody

19:24.250 --> 19:25.686
that doesn't want to be managed?

19:25.686 --> 19:29.124
I like the colors.
Looks like a rainbow.

19:29.124 --> 19:30.125
Tony.

19:31.648 --> 19:34.216
Ben, you need to work
on your whistling, bro.

19:34.216 --> 19:35.217
What are you doing now?

19:35.217 --> 19:37.132
Just standing by for service.

19:37.132 --> 19:38.264
Well, I'm really proud of you.

19:38.264 --> 19:40.135
- Thank you.
- For turning it around.

19:40.135 --> 19:41.310
Thank you.

19:41.310 --> 19:42.964
Because I don't
want to fire you.

19:42.964 --> 19:44.313
- I don't want you to fire me.
- I don't want to.

19:44.313 --> 19:45.575
It's not fun for me.

19:45.575 --> 19:47.055
- I know, I know.
- Not at all.

19:47.055 --> 19:49.623
I feel like these guests are,
they love me for now.

19:49.623 --> 19:50.624
- Right.
- They're going to wear us down.

19:50.624 --> 19:51.842
Yeah, yeah, they are.

19:51.842 --> 19:52.756
But, um...

19:52.756 --> 19:54.236
As of day one, it's going good.

19:54.236 --> 19:55.368
Like any charter, you know?

19:55.368 --> 19:56.847
Yeah, I appreciate it all.

19:56.847 --> 19:58.153
You're making Mama proud.
Do you know that?

19:58.153 --> 20:00.286
Yes.

20:00.286 --> 20:01.461
Interior, interior.

20:01.461 --> 20:03.985
Can you get into
your blacks, please?

20:15.692 --> 20:17.172
Babe, it's going to be
so----ing

20:17.172 --> 20:18.260
I can't even deal with that.

20:18.260 --> 20:19.957
Oh, this is adorable.

20:19.957 --> 20:22.003
Secret garden of gold.

20:24.962 --> 20:26.181
Look at these.

20:26.181 --> 20:28.009
Oh my God.

20:28.009 --> 20:29.532
Let's get ready.

20:29.532 --> 20:30.751
All right, half an hour
you guys.

20:30.751 --> 20:33.406
- 40 minutes?
- All right, 40 minutes.

20:33.406 --> 20:35.625
I'm just wondering if
Tony's not feeling well

20:35.625 --> 20:37.148
because he keeps
getting up at 4 a.m.

20:37.148 --> 20:38.280
It's kind of ridiculous.

20:38.280 --> 20:39.847
Hola, mami, ¿cómo estás?

20:39.847 --> 20:41.327
I feel super tired, you know,

20:41.327 --> 20:42.850
because we're working
at crazy hours.

20:42.850 --> 20:45.461
You know, it is so,
so difficult, you know.

20:45.461 --> 20:47.028
And then we're finished,

20:47.028 --> 20:48.943
and then I don't know what
I'm gonna do in my life.

20:53.208 --> 20:55.036
I need to do something.

20:55.036 --> 20:56.342
By the way, I looked
at your menu,

20:56.342 --> 20:57.604
I went, oh, six items.

20:57.604 --> 20:59.258
I knocked it down a little bit.

20:59.258 --> 21:01.564
I omitted the watermelon.

21:01.564 --> 21:02.870
Lunch didn't go as planned.

21:02.870 --> 21:04.698
So now the goal is to make sure

21:04.698 --> 21:06.613
that dinner goes off
without a hitch.

21:06.613 --> 21:08.354
We just gotta pull
all the platters

21:08.354 --> 21:10.704
so I can make the croquetas.

21:10.704 --> 21:13.707
So tonight, we're gonna
have patatas bravas,

21:13.707 --> 21:15.404
white wine clams,

21:15.404 --> 21:17.624
the quintessential
Spanish chorizo

21:17.624 --> 21:19.887
with saffron and----ing notes.

21:19.887 --> 21:22.411
And from there, we're gonna
go on to Spanish meatballs.

21:22.411 --> 21:24.457
Dear God, please help me.

21:24.457 --> 21:25.893
I'm quite happy with these,

21:25.893 --> 21:29.418
but your balls have made
my hands quite oily.

21:29.418 --> 21:30.985
- Hey, boo.
- Hey, boo.

21:39.210 --> 21:41.648
For me, it is.

21:58.491 --> 22:00.275
I feel like Camille's
improvement

22:00.275 --> 22:01.581
is very performative.

22:01.581 --> 22:04.497
When Fraser is there,
she's a little angel,

22:04.497 --> 22:07.282
and then when he's gone,
she flips the script

22:07.282 --> 22:08.849
and it's right back to day one.

22:08.849 --> 22:11.808
And it just seems like
she's getting away with a lot.

22:13.854 --> 22:15.116
Let's continue smashing it.

22:18.075 --> 22:19.947
You can just put perfume
and just comb your hair.

22:27.389 --> 22:28.564
Please do follow me.

22:28.564 --> 22:29.652
We will make our way upstairs.

22:29.652 --> 22:31.828
You do look very majestical.

22:32.960 --> 22:37.965
- ♪ Happy birthday to you
- Wow!

22:37.965 --> 22:40.446
Good, good.
Setting this bitch on fire.

22:43.492 --> 22:44.798
Thank you, guys.

22:44.798 --> 22:46.495
Thank you.
Thank you so much.

22:46.495 --> 22:48.976
Oh,----ing son of a bitch.

22:48.976 --> 22:51.500
I am the luckiest person
in this world.

22:51.500 --> 22:54.764
- Happy birthday!
- Happy birthday!

22:54.764 --> 22:57.376
It is called patanegra,
Spanish ham.

22:57.376 --> 23:00.117
Mmm, that's----ing good, bro.

23:00.117 --> 23:04.992
Would you like some patanegra?
Spanish pork?

23:04.992 --> 23:06.341
Nice kick to it.

23:06.341 --> 23:07.516
It's very good.

23:07.516 --> 23:09.866
Oh, this is so good.
Try that.

23:09.866 --> 23:11.433
Chorizo is coming out, too.

23:11.433 --> 23:12.782
All right, one to the next one.

23:12.782 --> 23:15.437
- Oh, wow.
- Oh, what is this?

23:15.437 --> 23:16.830
We've got some chorizo here.

23:16.830 --> 23:18.397
- That's chorizo?
- Mmm.

23:18.397 --> 23:20.660
- Yeah, don't like it.
- It's cold. It's not warm.

23:20.660 --> 23:21.965
Yeah, I know.

23:21.965 --> 23:23.576
Do you have a
paper napkin, Fraser?

23:23.576 --> 23:24.620
Yes.

23:24.620 --> 23:26.230
Can I just get a paper napkin?

23:31.714 --> 23:34.369
Oh, you're----ing kidding me.

23:34.369 --> 23:37.024
Thank you.

23:37.024 --> 23:38.242
Mmm.

23:38.242 --> 23:40.680
Yeah, that's perfect.

23:40.680 --> 23:42.899
Okay. I'm sorry.

23:42.899 --> 23:44.771
Yeah, that I do not like.

23:44.771 --> 23:46.076
They're being painful.

23:46.076 --> 23:47.513
Let's clear the table completely.

23:47.513 --> 23:49.253
They're like, not happy.

23:49.253 --> 23:51.299
Am I being mean to say
that I've tasted

23:51.299 --> 23:55.216
one of the best food and
one of the worst foods here?

23:55.216 --> 23:58.132
Some things are, like,
amazing and some are not.

24:01.744 --> 24:03.398
Coming up...

24:03.398 --> 24:04.399
You, light him up.

24:04.399 --> 24:05.835
No.

24:05.835 --> 24:07.054
They're all smoking
the cigars backwards.

24:07.054 --> 24:08.359
Exactly.
That's what I thought.

24:08.359 --> 24:10.579
It's so----ing funny
to see these guests

24:10.579 --> 24:12.886
smoking their dick-like
cigars backwards,

24:12.886 --> 24:15.279
balls deep in their mouth.

24:19.240 --> 24:21.634
Am I being mean to
say that I've tasted

24:21.634 --> 24:24.985
one of the best food and one
of the worst foods here?

24:24.985 --> 24:28.292
Some things are, like,
amazing and some are not.

24:28.292 --> 24:31.034
When you deal with chefs,
you're handling fire.

24:31.034 --> 24:32.514
Okay, those can go up.

24:32.514 --> 24:38.346
And sometimes feedback is
not worth upsetting chef.

24:38.346 --> 24:39.956
Help me, Jesus!

24:39.956 --> 24:41.436
I hope these people tip well.

24:41.436 --> 24:43.525
That's a secret between
myself, the guests,

24:43.525 --> 24:45.135
and the trash can.

24:45.135 --> 24:48.008
Any deck crew available to help
us run some plates, please?

24:49.444 --> 24:51.838
Spanish meatballs with saffron.

24:51.838 --> 24:53.187
These are the meatballs.

24:55.885 --> 24:56.843
Those are ready to roll.

24:56.843 --> 24:58.366
Thank you.

24:58.366 --> 25:00.368
We've got some Antigua
and mushroom empanadas.

25:00.368 --> 25:02.544
It's deep fried and
has cheese in it.

25:02.544 --> 25:03.589
You can't go wrong.

25:03.589 --> 25:05.329
All right, cool.

25:05.329 --> 25:07.462
- This is really good.
- This is really good.

25:07.462 --> 25:09.116
Fraser's on one today.

25:09.116 --> 25:12.032
Like, these guests have
him extra stressed out.

25:12.032 --> 25:13.512
I don't like them at all.

25:13.512 --> 25:15.470
We've got, like,
probably the most demanding

25:15.470 --> 25:17.037
guests we've had yet.

25:17.037 --> 25:21.302
They seem to have an issue
with pretty much everything.

25:21.302 --> 25:23.739
That actually makes
you look like a dickhead.

25:23.739 --> 25:25.393
- What did you think?
- Sh--.

25:25.393 --> 25:28.135
I really hope the ones next
after this are just chill,

25:28.135 --> 25:30.746
so we just get, like,
a little----ing break.

25:30.746 --> 25:32.095
I'm very excited
for tomorrow's picnic.

25:32.095 --> 25:34.576
I really hope that
the spot is beautiful.

25:34.576 --> 25:35.577
- I want a good spot.
- Yeah.

25:35.577 --> 25:36.752
No rocks.

25:38.406 --> 25:40.277
I have a massive headache,
so I'm going to lay down.

25:40.277 --> 25:41.409
Copy that.

25:41.409 --> 25:42.889
- Good work tonight.
- Thank you.

25:42.889 --> 25:44.368
All right.
Are we ready to go?

25:44.368 --> 25:45.935
Been ready.

25:45.935 --> 25:47.197
So, I'm going to go,
because I'm going to get up.

25:47.197 --> 25:48.764
I'll try and do
some stuff myself.

25:48.764 --> 25:50.461
- All right.
- Thank you.

25:52.942 --> 25:54.161
I'm just going to
say goodnight.

25:54.161 --> 25:55.902
Goodnight.

25:55.902 --> 25:57.904
Goodnight, angels.

25:57.904 --> 25:58.992
I'm going this way, too.

25:58.992 --> 26:02.386
Oh, my God, you're following me.

26:02.386 --> 26:03.605
It's very, very hot.

26:03.605 --> 26:04.954
Okay, guys. Enjoy.

26:06.303 --> 26:08.915
Yeah, I'm working on it
right now.

26:16.357 --> 26:18.402
- Everybody's working.
- There we go.

26:18.402 --> 26:20.317
You got it.

26:20.317 --> 26:21.797
Now.

26:24.931 --> 26:26.497
- Yeah.
- Bro.

26:27.977 --> 26:29.631
Exactly.
That's what I thought.

26:29.631 --> 26:32.678
It is so----ing funny to see
these guests smoking their

26:32.678 --> 26:36.290
dick-like cigars backwards,
balls deep in their mouth.

26:36.290 --> 26:37.639
Oh...

26:37.639 --> 26:39.467
I love it. Just...

26:40.860 --> 26:42.252
Okay, goodnight, baby.

26:42.252 --> 26:44.167
All righty.

26:59.530 --> 27:00.575
Sure.

27:02.969 --> 27:04.884
Tequila with sparkling water?

27:04.884 --> 27:06.276
- Six.
- Four.

27:09.802 --> 27:11.020
There's this song.

27:11.020 --> 27:13.153
You know what this
song is about?

27:21.552 --> 27:24.381
You know, I don't mind
cleaning up after the guests.

27:24.381 --> 27:25.644
Okay.

27:26.732 --> 27:28.472
But when you start to be rude,

27:28.472 --> 27:31.693
I will literally wipe my ass
with your pillow

27:31.693 --> 27:33.347
and just, like,
put it back.

27:34.914 --> 27:36.567
These bitches need to leave.

27:36.567 --> 27:37.743
And go to bed.

27:37.743 --> 27:39.309
Are you mixing your tequilas?

27:39.309 --> 27:41.181
Like, are we switching
brands through the night?

27:41.181 --> 27:42.617
Huh?

27:42.617 --> 27:45.054
Well, this is the one
that you guys wanted, right?

27:46.186 --> 27:47.578
- One lime.
- One lime.

27:47.578 --> 27:49.145
One lime.

27:54.760 --> 27:56.196
Let's go.

27:56.196 --> 27:57.545
Good night, guys.

27:57.545 --> 27:58.546
See you tomorrow.

27:58.546 --> 27:59.765
Good night.

27:59.765 --> 28:01.027
See you tomorrow.

28:04.030 --> 28:05.248
God...

28:34.060 --> 28:35.757
They really trashed this boat.

28:35.757 --> 28:38.934
Deck crew, deck crew.
You can haul the anchor.

28:38.934 --> 28:40.240
Tony.

28:40.240 --> 28:44.026
Let me just breathe a
little bit of fresh air

28:44.026 --> 28:45.593
before I go into the cave.

28:45.593 --> 28:46.725
Oh, you're not ready.

28:46.725 --> 28:47.943
I'm going, I'm going.

28:49.118 --> 28:50.380
You ready?

28:55.821 --> 28:58.040
Ai, yi, yi, yi.

28:58.040 --> 28:59.781
You okay?

28:59.781 --> 29:02.392
Green shackle at the water line,
straight up and down.

29:02.392 --> 29:04.743
Yeah, that sexy radio voice.

29:04.743 --> 29:07.310
Shut up.

29:07.310 --> 29:08.877
Anchor in the pocket.

29:08.877 --> 29:10.618
Well done. Well done.
Thank you.

29:10.618 --> 29:11.750
<i>Thank you.</i>

29:13.839 --> 29:16.798
Oh, my God.

29:16.798 --> 29:18.713
Bless her.

29:18.713 --> 29:20.584
Alissa wrote, guests were rude.

29:20.584 --> 29:23.022
She went down at 3:45.

29:23.022 --> 29:24.545
Oh, okay.

29:25.589 --> 29:26.939
- How are you feeling?
- Good.

29:26.939 --> 29:28.679
Yeah, perfect.
Need some caffeine?

29:28.679 --> 29:29.724
Please.

29:32.858 --> 29:34.903
Just going to leave this here
and you can pass that thing.

29:34.903 --> 29:36.165
Thank you.

29:38.080 --> 29:39.473
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

29:39.473 --> 29:41.518
- For you, madam.
- Thank you.

29:43.869 --> 29:45.087
Yeah.

29:45.871 --> 29:47.437
Do a barbecue of some sort.

29:47.437 --> 29:50.179
And then we'll do some
fun activities on the beach.

29:51.702 --> 29:52.965
Yeah.

29:52.965 --> 29:54.357
If you want to change
into your beach gear.

29:54.357 --> 29:56.707
And then I just wanted
to ask you about,

29:56.707 --> 29:58.318
you weren't feeling
very well yesterday?

29:58.318 --> 29:59.972
My sinus gets infected.

29:59.972 --> 30:02.931
And when that happens, I get
terrible headaches, you know?

30:02.931 --> 30:05.325
You know, I know you love
to work out at 4 a.m.

30:05.325 --> 30:07.849
But maybe if you are
feeling tired in the last,

30:07.849 --> 30:09.155
in the later part of the day,

30:09.155 --> 30:12.027
you might have to maybe
not get up at 4 a.m.

30:16.902 --> 30:18.860
I don't feel like anyone
moves like faster than me.

30:18.860 --> 30:21.036
For example, you ask me
to pull lines, I do it.

30:21.036 --> 30:22.733
You guys need two people
I do it by myself.

30:22.733 --> 30:25.388
Your strength
doesn't go unnoticed

30:25.388 --> 30:26.868
and we appreciate it very much.

30:26.868 --> 30:29.958
We're just wondering if getting
up at an hour and a half

30:29.958 --> 30:32.134
before you're supposed to work.

30:37.923 --> 30:39.359
Coming up...

30:39.359 --> 30:41.013
You're tarnishing who I
am because you want to...

30:41.013 --> 30:43.232
No, you are tarnishing--

30:45.060 --> 30:46.845
Alissa, you have a
problem with me

30:46.845 --> 30:48.324
for no goddamn----ing reason.

30:48.324 --> 30:50.631
You're a----ing
bully, Alissa!

30:50.631 --> 30:56.680
Oof.

30:56.680 --> 30:58.900
I would never want to do
this kind of conversation

30:58.900 --> 31:00.293
for no reason.

31:00.293 --> 31:02.512
I'm just saying
we're having this chat

31:02.512 --> 31:04.123
just so we can work together

31:04.123 --> 31:05.341
because we want everyone to,

31:05.341 --> 31:06.865
you know, be sharing
the workload.

31:06.865 --> 31:08.127
Yeah.

31:08.127 --> 31:09.476
If you feel like, I mean,

31:09.476 --> 31:11.434
I need to go a little
bit faster, I can.

31:11.434 --> 31:12.914
I fully, fully understand you

31:12.914 --> 31:14.481
and I'm going to try my best.

31:14.481 --> 31:18.137
We are a team and I don't
want to be the weak spot.

31:18.137 --> 31:19.834
I would feel like sh--.

31:19.834 --> 31:22.184
In the second part of the day,
we still need to keep pushing.

31:25.274 --> 31:28.321
I am here because
I wanted to be here.

31:28.321 --> 31:31.063
Not many people in my
country get, you know,

31:31.063 --> 31:32.194
like, this opportunity,

31:32.194 --> 31:34.153
so I'm gonna get it done.

31:34.153 --> 31:35.806
All right, well,
we'll work together.

31:35.806 --> 31:38.418
And like I said, we all very
much appreciate your work

31:38.418 --> 31:40.507
and what everybody is
doing on board.

31:40.507 --> 31:42.770
Apparently, the guests
were rude last night, right?

31:44.728 --> 31:48.819
They were saying about cigars
and saying about...

31:48.819 --> 31:50.647
And they were smoking
them the wrong way.

31:50.647 --> 31:51.822
Shut up.

31:51.822 --> 31:54.651
They were smoking
them the wrong way.

31:54.651 --> 31:56.827
So really experienced
cigar smokers then, yeah?

31:58.525 --> 31:59.874
<i>I'm just going to drop
off the back of this</i>

31:59.874 --> 32:01.180
catamaran
on our starboard side,

32:01.180 --> 32:02.268
then we can let it go.

32:02.268 --> 32:03.486
<i>Copy that.</i>

32:03.486 --> 32:05.749
I just a quick one
about lunch today.

32:05.749 --> 32:07.708
We'll try and get you to
the beach around twoish

32:07.708 --> 32:09.318
so you have an
hour before lunch.

32:09.318 --> 32:10.885
- Okay, sure.
- Yeah, like...

32:10.885 --> 32:11.886
Okay.

32:11.886 --> 32:12.974
As early as we can get it.

32:12.974 --> 32:14.193
As early as we can.

32:14.193 --> 32:15.977
So it's red, yellow,
blue, white.

32:15.977 --> 32:17.457
Rub your balls with grease.

32:17.457 --> 32:18.893
Oh, rub, red, yellow, blue.

32:18.893 --> 32:20.851
Anchor down, anchor down.

32:22.201 --> 32:23.550
Two shackles in the water.

32:23.550 --> 32:25.334
<i>Lock it down there,
we're all set.</i>

32:25.334 --> 32:27.771
- Hello.
- Hiya, you okay?

32:27.771 --> 32:31.775
My feet are hurting me
and I just woke up.

32:31.775 --> 32:34.909
Hey Ross, I'd like to pop
in the tender with you.

32:34.909 --> 32:35.997
Okay, copy.

32:40.175 --> 32:41.307
Just want to see for myself.

32:41.307 --> 32:42.873
Plus, I want to go
for a boat ride.

32:42.873 --> 32:44.875
So I'm going to need
some ice in this.

32:44.875 --> 32:46.225
Yep.

32:46.225 --> 32:48.009
I think it's going
to be too crazy, right?

32:48.009 --> 32:49.054
Yeah, and it's too windy.

32:49.054 --> 32:50.229
Too windy.

32:50.229 --> 32:51.882
Maybe on the other side.

32:51.882 --> 32:53.754
You can even lay
those bad boys on the floor

32:53.754 --> 32:54.581
if you need to.

32:54.581 --> 32:55.843
This is freaking amazing.

32:55.843 --> 32:59.064
Got the trees,
there's no people.

32:59.064 --> 33:00.456
This is spectacular.

33:00.456 --> 33:01.675
I love this.

33:01.675 --> 33:05.679
Lintel one, garnish one,
salad one.

33:07.333 --> 33:08.421
There we go.

33:08.421 --> 33:11.902
Got shots for you guys.

33:11.902 --> 33:12.773
What would you like?

33:12.773 --> 33:13.948
- Lime, lime, lime.
- A lime.

33:13.948 --> 33:14.818
Here's some lime.

33:14.818 --> 33:16.298
This is actually an orange.

33:16.298 --> 33:18.953
All right, this is going
to go to the beach.

33:18.953 --> 33:20.302
You're going to have
to use the strength

33:20.302 --> 33:21.608
of five evocative otters.

33:21.608 --> 33:23.262
- Fire ants.
- Yeah.

33:23.262 --> 33:24.611
See you soon.

33:24.611 --> 33:26.961
Oven roasted potatoes,
can serve with a spoon.

33:26.961 --> 33:29.833
Burgers on the brioche bun,
you want tongs for those too?

33:29.833 --> 33:30.878
Yes, please.

33:34.055 --> 33:35.622
Alissa and Rachel
are going to come together.

33:35.622 --> 33:36.840
Alissa and Rachel, together.

33:36.840 --> 33:38.103
Yeah.

33:38.103 --> 33:40.192
And I'm going to go back
when they come here.

33:40.192 --> 33:43.630
Look at this horse and child,
horse and child combination.

33:44.631 --> 33:46.111
Yeah, no problem.

33:46.111 --> 33:49.462
Yeah, I just realized that
this space here...

33:49.462 --> 33:51.029
is hideous.

33:52.769 --> 33:54.336
I'm loving the spots of rubbish.

33:54.336 --> 33:56.121
Right, the little bottle
caps and everything.

33:56.121 --> 33:57.992
I think it gives us
some texture, doesn't it?

33:57.992 --> 33:59.341
The odd syringe.

33:59.341 --> 34:04.781
All I see is cars,
bottle caps and rocks.

34:04.781 --> 34:09.699
However, my lane doesn't
merge into Captain's lane

34:09.699 --> 34:12.485
of figuring out where we are
to go to the beach picnic.

34:12.485 --> 34:14.791
I'm in a situation here
where I've just got

34:14.791 --> 34:18.360
to put a sh--load of lipstick
on one hell of a pig.

34:21.059 --> 34:23.844
And then do you think we
are ready to go to the beach?

34:23.844 --> 34:25.759
I'm unable to get a connection
with the shore party,

34:25.759 --> 34:27.630
but I do know that
it's very soon.

34:27.630 --> 34:28.675
As early as possible.

34:28.675 --> 34:29.937
- Oh, we are ready.
- Okay.

34:29.937 --> 34:31.417
Pass that one.

34:31.417 --> 34:32.505
It's a VHF, I'll be
on six-nine as well.

34:32.505 --> 34:34.028
Six-nine, copy.

34:34.028 --> 34:35.203
It smells like animal poo.

34:35.203 --> 34:36.509
- Yep.
- Just a little bit.

34:36.509 --> 34:38.337
- Welcome to the beach.
- Yeah, right?

34:38.337 --> 34:39.860
Good luck, Cheffy.

34:39.860 --> 34:42.515
I'm going to smell like a
beast when I leave here.

34:44.517 --> 34:45.953
Let's go.

34:45.953 --> 34:47.607
Yeah, we're ready.
We're ready to party.

34:47.607 --> 34:50.566
Alissa, everything the
way it's packed

34:50.566 --> 34:52.133
is going to be all warm
and perfect.

34:52.133 --> 34:54.570
Baby, I just want to be warm
and perfect for you.

34:54.570 --> 34:57.138
Shut your face
when you're talking to me.

34:57.138 --> 34:58.661
Don't play with me.

34:58.661 --> 34:59.662
Are you guys ready?

34:59.662 --> 35:01.229
We've been waiting.

35:01.229 --> 35:02.970
Let's watch them go.
It's going to feel really nice.

35:02.970 --> 35:05.451
God, I really don't like them.

35:05.451 --> 35:07.366
Be gone and don't come back.

35:07.366 --> 35:09.542
Bye.

35:09.542 --> 35:11.979
What a horrible group of people.

35:13.850 --> 35:16.810
Hi. Welcome.
How are you?

35:16.810 --> 35:19.508
This is very rocky.
Pebble Beach.

35:19.508 --> 35:21.597
Oh, damn.
I hate it.

35:21.597 --> 35:24.165
- The bar is open.
- I'm ready for food.

35:24.165 --> 35:26.080
Do you guys want to eat now
and then play?

35:26.080 --> 35:27.342
Let's eat.

35:27.342 --> 35:30.171
- Hey, Rachel.
- What's happening?

35:30.171 --> 35:31.172
This is funny.

35:31.172 --> 35:32.173
So how are you guys doing?

35:32.173 --> 35:33.218
- Good.
- Hungry.

35:33.218 --> 35:34.349
Hungry.

35:34.349 --> 35:35.742
So the food
is on the way.

35:35.742 --> 35:37.091
Do we have to help ourselves?

35:37.091 --> 35:38.223
Hello, everybody.

35:38.223 --> 35:39.746
Well, welcome to
your beach excursion.

35:39.746 --> 35:41.661
We're going to do all
of your sides first,

35:41.661 --> 35:43.315
and then we're going to
do veggie patty,

35:43.315 --> 35:46.753
crab cake, or beef burger
with bone-in ribeye as well.

35:46.753 --> 35:48.755
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

35:48.755 --> 35:50.409
You're really killing it
in service.

35:50.409 --> 35:51.932
The view is amazing.

35:51.932 --> 35:53.803
I don't like the beach,
but the view is beautiful.

35:53.803 --> 35:55.718
The sand is not soft.
It's too rocky.

35:55.718 --> 35:57.764
All right, guys.
Here we go, burgers.

35:57.764 --> 35:58.634
Veggie.

35:58.634 --> 36:02.116
Hey! Look at that.

36:02.116 --> 36:05.119
Hey, we're going to
put you on service.

36:05.119 --> 36:06.251
You don't mind, do you?

36:06.251 --> 36:07.774
- So good.
- All right.

36:07.774 --> 36:09.732
I think the dressing was
so good. I put so much on it.

36:09.732 --> 36:10.777
Everything is good.

36:10.777 --> 36:12.213
All right.
What are we doing next?

36:12.213 --> 36:13.780
Water.

36:13.780 --> 36:15.216
We should all put our feet up.

36:15.216 --> 36:17.218
We think we need to, captain.

36:17.218 --> 36:21.179
When I was thinking of beach,
yeah, this was not on my mind.

36:21.179 --> 36:24.312
Oh, they say to do this
for half an hour a day.

36:24.312 --> 36:26.836
Who's got time to do this
for half an hour a day?

36:26.836 --> 36:28.273
You got to make the time,

36:28.273 --> 36:31.276
because if you don't,
life is going to fly by.

36:31.276 --> 36:33.147
Food was good, but honestly,

36:33.147 --> 36:34.627
I'm not impressed with
the water at all.

36:34.627 --> 36:37.107
We've been to so many
beautiful spots in the world.

36:37.107 --> 36:39.588
Aruba waters,
St. Thomas waters,

36:39.588 --> 36:40.589
St. John waters.

36:40.589 --> 36:41.982
This looks like backwater.

36:41.982 --> 36:44.724
We asked for a secluded spot.

36:48.771 --> 36:58.912
It does. It looks like
a rundown campground.

36:58.912 --> 37:00.609
Let's go. Let's go.

37:04.439 --> 37:05.788
Mm-mm, good.

37:08.878 --> 37:10.271
How'd it go, Rachel?

37:10.271 --> 37:12.099
The guests are so happy.

37:14.797 --> 37:16.538
Hello, musclehead.

37:16.538 --> 37:19.237
You want to carry this with me?

37:19.237 --> 37:21.108
Oh.

37:21.108 --> 37:23.458
- It dies.
- You're such a drama queen.

37:23.458 --> 37:24.503
Ah!

37:24.503 --> 37:27.332
Whoo!

37:27.332 --> 37:28.420
What do you want?

37:28.420 --> 37:29.986
This is so----ing annoying.

37:32.946 --> 37:34.339
<i>Fraser, Fraser, Alissa,</i>

37:34.339 --> 37:36.950
<i>me and Tony are pretty
packed here on the beach.</i>

37:36.950 --> 37:38.256
Okay, that's great.

37:38.256 --> 37:39.822
We'll send the tender
to come get you now.

37:39.822 --> 37:41.476
Thank you.
Goodbye, everyone.

37:41.476 --> 37:43.957
Cheers!

37:43.957 --> 37:45.567
Hayley. What are you
decorating right now?

37:45.567 --> 37:47.308
Are you talking to me, darling?

37:53.009 --> 37:54.707
- Very glamorous.
- Bye!

37:54.707 --> 37:56.361
Is it Bollywood tonight?

37:56.361 --> 37:59.320
It's Bollywood dressed up
because colorful decoration,

37:59.320 --> 38:00.713
Hindi Bollywood music.

38:03.237 --> 38:04.194
Yes.

38:04.194 --> 38:04.978
Of course.

38:04.978 --> 38:06.414
Fraser, Fraser, Tony.

38:06.414 --> 38:08.024
<i>There is some clothes
in the master's room</i>

38:08.024 --> 38:09.374
<i>that needs to be
ironed for tonight.</i>

38:09.374 --> 38:10.636
Okay, copy that.
Thank you.

38:10.636 --> 38:12.333
You think I can, like,
jump on there?

38:12.333 --> 38:13.987
Hold on, hold on.
Let me pull it closer.

38:15.554 --> 38:16.946
Yeah.

38:19.993 --> 38:21.864
Hi, friends.
It's nice to be back.

38:21.864 --> 38:23.866
- How was it?
- It was okay.

38:23.866 --> 38:25.303
Camille was, like,
swimming in the water,

38:25.303 --> 38:28.393
so if she can take a swim,
I think she can handle.

38:28.393 --> 38:29.872
For sure.

38:29.872 --> 38:31.352
But I also was, like,
I'd rather you here because...

38:31.352 --> 38:33.398
Can I get you decorating
downstairs for their arrival?

38:33.398 --> 38:35.138
Do you care that I have
a little bit of sand on me?

38:35.138 --> 38:36.531
- I don't give a sh--.
- Okay.

38:36.531 --> 38:39.229
I really don't know where
I stand with Camille.

38:39.229 --> 38:42.537
Alissa and Camille
do not get along,

38:42.537 --> 38:45.975
but Camille has been working
a bit harder and faster.

38:45.975 --> 38:48.195
I don't know what's happening
when I'm not around,

38:48.195 --> 38:50.850
and I don't know
whose side to take,

38:50.850 --> 38:52.242
so I'm not going to take a side.

38:52.242 --> 38:54.114
These fun things can
just go everywhere.

38:54.114 --> 38:55.942
All righty, guys,
when you're ready.

38:59.728 --> 39:01.730
All right, thank you.

39:01.730 --> 39:03.384
Where's that sticky tape?

39:03.384 --> 39:05.517
What about something
like this, Alissa?

39:05.517 --> 39:07.606
So cute.

39:07.606 --> 39:09.129
- Yeah.
- Bye, blue tape.

39:09.129 --> 39:10.391
But just so you know,
in these pillowcases,

39:10.391 --> 39:12.045
they're mainly ours.

39:13.394 --> 39:14.395
Hey.

39:14.395 --> 39:16.179
Did you have fun?

39:17.529 --> 39:19.313
Yeah.

39:19.313 --> 39:21.097
That's something
we can't control.

39:21.097 --> 39:23.099
St. Lucia doesn't
really have beaches.

39:23.099 --> 39:25.580
Give you a call when
we're ready to come,

39:25.580 --> 39:27.321
and collect us.

39:27.321 --> 39:29.018
Ooh, I like this.

39:29.018 --> 39:31.412
Yes!
We decorated for you guys.

39:32.935 --> 39:34.981
Get some chill shots for you.

39:38.419 --> 39:40.421
We're going to take a moment
and just take in the sunset.

39:40.421 --> 39:42.249
Sometimes you just have
to take a moment.

39:49.430 --> 39:51.432
This is going really quick
with what's happening

39:51.432 --> 39:52.433
with Camille and I.

39:52.433 --> 39:53.782
I really like Ben.

39:53.782 --> 39:56.176
It's taken me some time.

39:56.176 --> 39:57.743
This is kind of turning
into more relationship

39:57.743 --> 39:59.527
rather than just like a fling.

39:59.527 --> 40:01.486
Do you think I look pretty?

40:01.486 --> 40:02.878
- Right now?
- Yeah.

40:07.840 --> 40:09.581
Ben.

40:09.581 --> 40:13.280
He's from Australia and
that's across the globe.

40:13.280 --> 40:16.022
It's just not realistic
for us to carry on,

40:16.022 --> 40:17.632
but, yeah, know,
at the moment,

40:17.632 --> 40:20.983
I just like to keep it at the
fact that I really like him.

40:20.983 --> 40:24.770
I'm falling hard for this girl
right now.

40:24.770 --> 40:26.989
Oh, Ben.
What are you doing?

40:32.125 --> 40:33.343
Let's go up on deck.

40:33.343 --> 40:34.127
Okay.

40:34.127 --> 40:35.389
<i>All crew, all crew.</i>

40:35.389 --> 40:36.782
<i>Can you get into
your blacks, please?</i>

40:36.782 --> 40:37.783
<i>Copy that.</i>

40:37.783 --> 40:38.784
Okay, do I look okay?

40:38.784 --> 40:41.569
You look gorgeous.

40:41.569 --> 40:42.875
Thank you.

40:46.835 --> 40:48.489
Are you guys doing okay up here?

40:48.489 --> 40:50.839
Amazing.
I'll be right back with this.

40:51.971 --> 40:53.668
That hurt.

40:53.668 --> 40:55.235
Pardon me.

40:55.235 --> 40:56.758
All right, Camille's
on board now?

40:56.758 --> 40:57.803
She is?

40:57.803 --> 40:59.369
There she is, there she is.

40:59.369 --> 41:01.894
Have a little welcome back
job for you, darling.

41:01.894 --> 41:03.373
I can't.
I'm sorry, I can't right now.

41:03.373 --> 41:04.940
- I just can't right now.
- No, not right this second.

41:04.940 --> 41:06.202
No, no, no, we can talk
about it in a second.

41:06.202 --> 41:07.813
- Yeah.
- It's just ironing, babe.

41:07.813 --> 41:09.815
Get the clothes out of the
master cabinet and iron them.

41:09.815 --> 41:11.730
No, just wait a second.

41:11.730 --> 41:14.210
That's it.
That's the talk.

41:16.691 --> 41:17.997
I'm just speechless.

41:17.997 --> 41:19.607
So you want to hear
my shower dilemma?

41:19.607 --> 41:21.000
Oh, talk to me.

41:21.000 --> 41:23.263
So I've had a shower
every night. Cold.

41:25.047 --> 41:26.440
You turn the handle
to the right.

41:28.094 --> 41:29.835
Oh, shut the front door.

41:29.835 --> 41:31.401
Mine's opposite as well.

41:33.534 --> 41:35.014
Oh, my God. If you can't
understand

41:35.014 --> 41:36.537
what the tude's about.

41:36.537 --> 41:38.017
I mean, I guess I could
take it to the captain

41:38.017 --> 41:39.018
and she'll understand that.

41:39.018 --> 41:40.019
Yeah, take it to the captain.

41:40.019 --> 41:41.542
What is going on?

41:41.542 --> 41:42.935
Literally, she stayed
there with her little boo,

41:42.935 --> 41:44.589
enjoyed the day.

41:44.589 --> 41:46.199
What's wrong with it?

41:46.199 --> 41:47.853
- I'm just like, no.
- No, I can't right now.

41:47.853 --> 41:49.245
I can't wait.

41:49.245 --> 41:51.160
Keep me the
out of this situation

41:51.160 --> 41:53.293
because I want
to remain neutral.

41:53.293 --> 41:54.816
Don't involve me in your sh--.

41:54.816 --> 41:57.645
Oh, so you're a child
for the captain's comment.

41:57.645 --> 41:59.212
An absolute child.

41:59.212 --> 42:00.692
You're a child for having
- ing attitude.

42:00.692 --> 42:02.520
No, you're a child for
the captain's comment.

42:02.520 --> 42:04.913
And if you want to keep it
going, we can keep it going.

42:06.045 --> 42:07.742
You literally just
gave Haley attitude.

42:07.742 --> 42:09.222
I said, give me a minute.

42:09.222 --> 42:11.137
No, you're like,
I can't listen. I can't.

42:11.137 --> 42:12.747
- I can't right now.
- Let's move on from it.

42:12.747 --> 42:13.879
Let's move on.

42:13.879 --> 42:16.185
No, I'm having a
hard time

42:16.185 --> 42:17.926
moving on from
what you're doing.

42:17.926 --> 42:19.754
I'm having a hard time moving
on from what you're doing.

42:19.754 --> 42:21.364
No, you're tarnishing
who I am

42:21.364 --> 42:23.410
because you want
to believe I'm somebody.

42:23.410 --> 42:27.893
You want to believe
I'm somebody I'm not.

42:27.893 --> 42:28.981
Alissa, you have
a problem with me

42:28.981 --> 42:30.025
for no Goddamn----ing reason.

42:30.025 --> 42:31.026
No, I don't.

42:31.026 --> 42:32.506
You have attitude with everybody

42:32.506 --> 42:34.073
and that's why everybody
had an issue with you

42:34.073 --> 42:35.248
and that's why
you're on your last leg

42:35.248 --> 42:37.424
and captain had to
speak with you.

42:37.424 --> 42:41.907
You're a----ing bully, Alissa.

42:41.907 --> 42:44.126
No, baby, you're a manipulator.

42:44.126 --> 42:45.954
- You're a bully.
- Camille, stop.

42:45.954 --> 42:47.521
This is insane.

42:47.521 --> 42:49.436
Two crew members screaming
at the top of their lungs

42:49.436 --> 42:51.090
while a charter's on board.

42:51.090 --> 42:52.613
That is not okay.

42:52.613 --> 42:54.093
- That's exciting for you.
- No, bitch.

42:54.093 --> 42:56.095
Zero tolerance. Stop.

42:56.095 --> 42:57.531
We're on charter.

42:57.531 --> 42:59.054
I'm not going to take
- ing disrespect.

42:59.054 --> 43:00.273
You're a----ing bully.

43:00.273 --> 43:02.101
You guys got
to compose yourself.

43:02.101 --> 43:04.233
I'm done.
