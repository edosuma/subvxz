Maybe half an hour.
Then I left,
went to the Old Stand.

-'Cause half an hour's enough
time to have killed her,

me to spend the weekend.

"I'm a Polack. She's a Polack."

27:39.741 --> 27:44.204
Then he jumps on his testicles,
but he's got muscular dystrophy
so it don't hurt too much.

27:44.204 --> 27:47.207
Maybe the beef gets out of hand,
and Sal croaks him.

27:47.207 --> 27:50.960
You think you can
get brain damage
listening to these people?

27:50.960 --> 27:54.005
♪♪

27:56.007 --> 28:00.345
I started for court.
I had the runs really bad.

28:00.345 --> 28:04.432
That's why I didn't show up.
You can ask my wife. Ask her
if I was sick three days.

28:04.432 --> 28:07.102
-Yeah, we'll look into that.
-That's why I failed to appear.

28:07.102 --> 28:10.271
I been convicted twice before.
I always show.

28:10.271 --> 28:13.316
Where were you
this past Saturday, Stanley?

28:13.316 --> 28:15.652
Wait. I thought this was about
an outstanding warrant.

28:15.652 --> 28:17.696
Where were you Saturday?

28:17.696 --> 28:19.489
Home with my wife.

28:21.157 --> 28:23.284
I thought this was
failure to appear.

28:23.284 --> 28:26.913
Your wife's employer
was murdered. You know anything
about that, Stanley?

28:26.913 --> 28:29.666
-No.
-Anything you wanna ask us?

28:29.666 --> 28:33.169
-No.
-You know which employer
we're talking about?

28:33.169 --> 28:36.923
-No.
-Katherine Dabrowski
was murdered.

28:36.923 --> 28:40.343
This is the woman that you
used to go and talk to after
she'd catch your wife stealing.

28:40.343 --> 28:43.346
-Beg her to let her
keep her job.
-I don't know from any murder.

28:43.346 --> 28:46.474
Mildred said you might've been
to see Miss Dabrowski
over the weekend.

28:46.474 --> 28:48.643
-No.
-If you weren't there, why
would your wife say you were?

28:48.643 --> 28:51.521
-I wasn't.
-The two of you ought to get
your stories straight.

28:51.521 --> 28:52.689
I'm staying with what I said.

28:52.689 --> 28:55.442
How about if
your fingerprints turn up in
Dabrowski's apartment?

28:55.442 --> 28:58.319
That could be from another time,
previously going to see her.

28:58.319 --> 29:01.114
-After your wife had stolen?
-I'm staying with my story.

29:01.114 --> 29:06.327
-Even if your wife
gives you up?
-I'm staying with my story.

29:06.327 --> 29:07.620
Fine.

29:14.836 --> 29:17.130
Josh, can you keep an eye
on this guy?

29:17.130 --> 29:20.383
How the hell you gonna
solve a case interviewing
somebody like that?

29:20.383 --> 29:24.512
-Move Mildred saying
Stanley gave her up?
-That may be too logical.

29:28.183 --> 29:30.769
-You're out of tea.
-We just talked
to Stanley, Mildred.

29:30.769 --> 29:33.980
-You're out of tea.
-It's time for you
to start cooperating.

29:33.980 --> 29:36.566
Now, Stanley said
you had good reason
for how you acted.

29:36.566 --> 29:40.320
He was real emphatic on that.
You had cause
for what you did?

29:40.320 --> 29:42.572
She was mean.

29:42.572 --> 29:45.158
She wouldn't let me
work in peace.

29:45.158 --> 29:47.744
Always complaining
about something.

29:47.744 --> 29:50.747
I did good work for her.
You'd never know
from how she treated me.

29:50.747 --> 29:53.374
-And that showed up on Friday?
-She was angry at her boyfriend.

29:53.374 --> 29:56.753
That's all she talked about.
Selfish and complaining.

29:56.753 --> 29:59.631
And then when I had to leave
to go to another job,
she got angry...

29:59.631 --> 30:01.424
because she wasn't
finished talking.

30:01.424 --> 30:04.010
-She didn't care I had
another job.
-Which explains what you did.

30:04.010 --> 30:07.514
-That was Stanley's point.
-I took a brooch and I left.

30:07.514 --> 30:10.016
That's the last time
I saw her alive.

30:10.016 --> 30:12.560
After you took the brooch,
what did you tell Stanley?

30:12.560 --> 30:17.398
I was afraid that
I was gonna get fired.

30:17.398 --> 30:21.236
-And he's not working.
We need the income.
-And so what did Stanley do?

30:21.236 --> 30:26.199
-I guess he went over there.
-You guess,
or that's what he did?

30:26.199 --> 30:29.202
He took the brooch
to return it to her,

30:29.202 --> 30:30.995
and I don't know what
happened over there.

30:30.995 --> 30:33.414
-What did he say
when he came back?
-I don't recall.

30:33.414 --> 30:37.418
Mildred, don't ask us to believe
that you don't remember
what he said.

30:37.418 --> 30:42.048
I guess he said something
like, uh,

30:42.048 --> 30:44.759
that everything was gonna
be all right now.

30:47.178 --> 30:50.139
Which is why I think
it was the other one.

30:52.016 --> 30:54.769
I'd feel really bad
if it was Stanley.

30:54.769 --> 30:57.021
Because trying to help me...

30:57.021 --> 30:59.440
would've been the reason
that he got into it.

31:01.901 --> 31:04.612
I think it was
the other one.

31:15.039 --> 31:17.458
That could be
a criminal mastermind
in that room.

31:17.458 --> 31:20.253
I come out of there,
I don't know what happened.
Plus I don't know what she said.

31:20.253 --> 31:23.882
-Plus I don't know if she knows.
-Where are you guys on
the Dabrowski homicide?

31:23.882 --> 31:26.634
It's the cleaning lady
or the husband,
or maybe both of them.

31:26.634 --> 31:29.095
-Any evidence
other than their statements?
-Not at present.

31:29.095 --> 31:32.098
When you decide
who you like, remember,
non-corroborated conversation...

31:32.098 --> 31:35.310
between husband and wife
is privileged
unless both parties waive.

31:35.310 --> 31:38.479
Yeah, well, our idea
was one flips, and then
the other one confesses.

31:38.479 --> 31:41.065
They knock New York on a lot
of "quality of life" issues,

31:41.065 --> 31:42.692
but no one can deny
this is the state to live in...

31:42.692 --> 31:45.862
if you wanna keep your spouse
from sending you to jail.

31:47.947 --> 31:51.409
Ever wonder what he does
at nights for fun?

32:05.673 --> 32:07.759
We appreciate your
coming in, Mr. Campisi.

32:07.759 --> 32:09.427
Why don't you have a seat?

32:11.429 --> 32:14.933
So when was it
you found out that
Mr. Sportelli'd been murdered?

32:14.933 --> 32:17.769
My wife, when she said
you were looking to talk to me.

32:17.769 --> 32:20.521
There was some confusion
when you left your home?

32:20.521 --> 32:24.817
-Your wife
was already in the shower?
-Yeah. I'd, uh, left previous.

32:24.817 --> 32:27.320
'Cause she said you'd left
while she was showering,

32:27.320 --> 32:29.113
and that she heard sirens
around then.

32:29.113 --> 32:33.242
-So the shooting already
had to have happened.
-No. I left previous.

32:33.242 --> 32:38.623
She was mistaken.
She told me that when we spoke.

32:38.623 --> 32:40.541
And we heard
you helped Frank out.

32:40.541 --> 32:45.046
You're not gonna help him
with his true problem,
which was muscular dystrophy.

32:45.046 --> 32:46.798
Yeah, but you helped him
around the house.

32:46.798 --> 32:53.054
Carpentry, plumbing.
But his true problem was health
and sadness from being sick.

32:53.054 --> 32:57.392
-I guess his true problem today
was somebody shootin' him.
-Yes.

32:57.392 --> 32:59.936
-Any ideas on that?
-No.

32:59.936 --> 33:03.356
How could you tell
Mr. Sportelli was depressed?

33:03.356 --> 33:06.401
People, one reason or another,
you can't please 'em.

33:06.401 --> 33:10.863
I just kept working.
I never started a job
I didn't finish.

33:10.863 --> 33:12.573
What work did you
help Frank with?

33:12.573 --> 33:15.618
The most recent was
took his whole sink out,

33:15.618 --> 33:17.662
mount a new one,
connect the pipes.

33:17.662 --> 33:22.792
Now, that situation, there was
a hairline gap at the wall.

33:22.792 --> 33:25.962
One person'll say
that's what caulking's for.

33:25.962 --> 33:29.674
Then an answer,
"That's the sloppy way out."

33:29.674 --> 33:33.136
Or you might indicate, uh,
a warped baseboard.

33:33.136 --> 33:37.015
The walls bulge
over the years. You're not
gonna get a perfect fit.

33:37.015 --> 33:40.059
This type exchange--

33:44.063 --> 33:46.524
I'm, uh,

33:46.524 --> 33:50.069
sick with
this whole situation.

33:50.069 --> 33:52.864
-I-I can tell you're upset.
-Of course I am.

33:55.116 --> 33:57.410
The poor fella died.

33:57.410 --> 34:00.163
How did that argument
end with Frank?

34:01.998 --> 34:04.709
Over the plumbing?

34:04.709 --> 34:09.464
Now, there, for instance,
he botched everything...

34:09.464 --> 34:13.217
trying to take
the caulking off.

34:13.217 --> 34:16.095
He couldn't hold
the chisel very good,

34:16.095 --> 34:20.683
so he ends up chipping
the wall and cabinet.

34:20.683 --> 34:25.521
I says, "Frank, I'm gonna
re-caulk this thing...

34:25.521 --> 34:28.441
and I want you
to stay away from it.

34:28.441 --> 34:33.946
And that's enough
with the phone calls to Runner
and everyone else...

34:33.946 --> 34:38.451
and abusing Oleta,
who's got health problems
on her own.

34:38.451 --> 34:42.914
She don't need
to hear that stuff,
criticized with your abuse."

34:47.168 --> 34:51.380
So, uh, I'm on my back
on the floor.

34:51.380 --> 34:57.720
Ten minutes later,
he comes back in with a gun.

34:57.720 --> 35:00.098
Comes in with a gun.

35:00.098 --> 35:01.891
What's the matter with him?

35:01.891 --> 35:05.728
"Sport, what are you, crazy?
What's the matter with you?"

35:05.728 --> 35:07.480
He says,

35:07.480 --> 35:10.858
"Get away from that cabinet
or I'll blow your head off,

35:10.858 --> 35:15.655
and don't put
no more caulking on."

35:15.655 --> 35:19.450
I'll tell ya, I was--
I was so upset with this.

35:23.579 --> 35:28.292
So I get to my feet.

35:28.292 --> 35:31.587
Twist the gun away.
I try to walk out.

35:31.587 --> 35:37.343
He comes after me with a hammer.
I don't even know how I knew it.

35:37.343 --> 35:42.515
I just turned,
and here he's coming.
I stop him from coming down...

35:42.515 --> 35:47.270
with the hammer on my head
out on the sidewalk.

35:47.270 --> 35:49.147
And with the other hand,

35:49.147 --> 35:53.526
he's trying to get the gun away.

35:53.526 --> 35:57.196
I don't know how
I wasn't strong enough...

35:57.196 --> 35:59.532
with him having that disease.

35:59.532 --> 36:02.535
But I couldn't pull the gun back
without it going off.

36:05.454 --> 36:07.415
I don't understand.

36:11.127 --> 36:13.254
But that's what happened.

36:15.923 --> 36:18.009
I shot and killed him.

36:21.387 --> 36:22.889
That's my confession.

36:27.643 --> 36:29.437
All right, Sal.

36:31.355 --> 36:33.691
I'm so upset with this.

36:39.780 --> 36:42.575
(door opens)
Does your wife lie, Stanley?
Sit down.

36:42.575 --> 36:45.369
-No, she don't lie.
-Does she get things wrong?
Is she stupid in that way?

36:45.369 --> 36:48.581
-She's ain't stupid.
-I said sit!

36:48.581 --> 36:52.585
Mildred says between her seeing
Miss Dabrowski alive and when
she found her dead today,

36:52.585 --> 36:55.796
you'd gone to her apartment
to keep her from taking
Mildred's job away.

36:55.796 --> 36:57.298
-All right, if I did.
-You admit you went there?

36:57.298 --> 37:00.426
-So you're changing your story
now? You admit you lied before?
-I admit nothin'.

37:00.426 --> 37:02.136
What happened when
you went over there, Stanley?

37:02.136 --> 37:04.847
-Did you talk to Miss Dabrowski
about Mildred stealing?
-How's that a crime?

37:04.847 --> 37:07.350
Nobody's saying it's a crime.
We're trying to find out
what happened.

37:07.350 --> 37:10.228
Her and that woman had
some strange thing between 'em.

37:10.228 --> 37:13.481
They were always
on each other's nerves.
Don't ask me what it was about.

37:13.481 --> 37:17.610
Did Mildred do this, Stanley?
We know it was you or her.

37:17.610 --> 37:20.029
And our thinking
is behind you
taking these two collars,

37:20.029 --> 37:23.282
you would make it look like
it was a break-in, make us
look different at what happened.

37:23.282 --> 37:24.825
This whole thing...

37:24.825 --> 37:29.622
has the mark of somebody
inexperienced, like Mildred.

37:31.707 --> 37:36.712
No. It was me.

37:36.712 --> 37:39.799
-It was you?
-(sighs)

37:41.050 --> 37:42.885
How'd you kill her?

37:42.885 --> 37:45.429
Like you said,
I went over to talk to her...

37:45.429 --> 37:48.724
to get Mildred's job back.

37:48.724 --> 37:51.894
-She started in arguing.
-So you strangled her?
You did this?

37:51.894 --> 37:55.856
-You're not protectin' her?
-It was me.

37:55.856 --> 37:58.234
-What did Mildred say
when you told her?
-Nothin'.

37:58.234 --> 38:02.613
You tell Mildred that
you killed Miss Dabrowski,
and she says nothing back?

38:02.613 --> 38:04.407
I didn't tell her.

38:24.218 --> 38:26.429
MILDRED:
There's no tea.

38:29.307 --> 38:32.310
-Stanley says you can
tell us what happened.
-I don't know.

38:32.310 --> 38:35.479
Your husband confessed, Mildred.
He said that he strangled
Miss Dabrowski,

38:35.479 --> 38:36.897
and you could tell us
what he said to you.

38:36.897 --> 38:40.609
He told us he told you, Mildred.
There's no harm in you
verifying that.

38:40.609 --> 38:42.903
He didn't tell me.

38:56.208 --> 38:59.295
-(chuckles)
-You're pattin' your head.

38:59.295 --> 39:02.965
Next time somebody tells
a joke about a dumb Polack,
you tell them...

39:02.965 --> 39:06.302
one of these two people,
both Polish,
is a criminal genius.

39:06.302 --> 39:08.262
The man said he did it, Andy.

39:08.262 --> 39:10.348
And he's got me
doubtin' he did.

39:10.348 --> 39:12.558
So he's smarter than me
doing it...

39:12.558 --> 39:15.353
and makin' me think
he might not have,
or she is beatin' a murder.

39:15.353 --> 39:17.188
Well, I--

39:20.149 --> 39:21.942
Hey. How'd you do?

39:21.942 --> 39:25.321
Self-defense.
The guy came in.

39:25.321 --> 39:26.405
SIMONE:
Listen.

39:36.248 --> 39:38.834
Thanks, Andy.

39:38.834 --> 39:41.754
-Let's go grab
some coffee somewhere.
-I gotta go somewhere.

39:41.754 --> 39:44.382
You gotta go somewhere.
Diane, we need to talk.

39:44.382 --> 39:47.968
Yeah. I can't now.
Um--

39:53.265 --> 39:55.518
(scoffs)

39:59.188 --> 40:01.190
I had a call
from One P.P., Bobby.

40:01.190 --> 40:05.361
Promotions list
is coming out tomorrow.
You're gettin' first grade.

40:07.363 --> 40:10.991
-Is that right?
-Yeah. Congratulations.

40:10.991 --> 40:13.119
Who else is on the list?

40:13.119 --> 40:14.787
No one else from the squad.

40:14.787 --> 40:17.123
-Andy's not on the list?
-No.

40:17.123 --> 40:20.084
- How do they make that work?
- Andy brought too much baggage.

40:21.001 --> 40:24.380
-Oh, boy.
-For what it's worth,
I put him up.

40:24.380 --> 40:27.633
-He told you on
the maid's husband?
-Guy's writing his statement?

40:27.633 --> 40:31.053
Uh-uh. We got, uh,
minor reservations
did he do it.

40:31.053 --> 40:33.055
Well, why would he be saying
he did?

40:33.055 --> 40:35.641
Well, neither one of them
was 100% clear
on their interviews.

40:35.641 --> 40:39.645
Andy here's, uh, working
on the theory that they're
both criminal masterminds.

40:39.645 --> 40:42.022
Another angle I thought of,
he's taking the hit
to get away from her.

40:42.022 --> 40:44.817
Well, she gets convicted,
he still gets to get away.

40:44.817 --> 40:49.029
But evil criminal genius
that she is, he knows
she beats it at trial.

40:49.029 --> 40:53.826
So they're both outside, and
he's stuck with her. Here, he's
got a guaranteed separation.

40:53.826 --> 40:56.620
-Do follow-up fives tomorrow.
-Yeah.

40:56.620 --> 41:01.250
He probably did it, all right?
Strangulation. I don't think
she's got the hands.

41:01.250 --> 41:04.420
-Thanks, boss.
-Yeah. Good night.

41:04.420 --> 41:07.256

scrub all them floors.

-I've gotta straighten out
what happened.
-Look, this asshole drugs you.

41:30.654 --> 41:32.740
But you don't think
that he's ready to hurt you
in other ways?

41:32.740 --> 41:37.119
No. He's not gonna
hurt me anymore.

41:37.119 --> 41:37.953
Hey.

You are not gonna change

Are you looking

No.

Do not get hurt.

You think it unmanly that
I'm partial to piña coladas?

Tell me what happened

Hey, asshole,

No sale, Mouse.

Don't seem like
your first shot there, Mouse.

-Tell me what you did,
or I'll kill you!

I can't believe
you did that to me.

Bad as you are,
I thought you cared about me.

43:26.812 --> 43:30.357
I do.
You wanna know what happened?

43:32.067 --> 43:37.197
I took off your clothes,
folded 'em neat.
And you know them cartoons,

43:37.197 --> 43:40.451
you got the good and bad Goofy,
and they're sitting on
either one of your shoulders?

43:40.451 --> 43:42.995
Tell me what you did.

43:42.995 --> 43:46.874
Listened to good Goofy
telling me it wouldn't be no fun
if you didn't say yes.

43:48.792 --> 43:51.086
You waiting for me
to say it's a fib?

43:51.086 --> 43:54.381
-Uh-huh.
-No fib, Mouse.

43:54.381 --> 43:58.802
What you said, thinking that
I cared about you, that's you
being a good judge of character.

Liery's evil twin.
-And that lets you off?

No, I wanted you.
I lost patience.

I wanna kiss you.

Don't murder me for this, huh?
