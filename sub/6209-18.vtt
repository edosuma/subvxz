00:05.172 --> 00:05.973

00:05.973 --> 00:08.075
That's Spanish for "No."

00:08.075 --> 00:09.243
I hope she got the job.

00:09.243 --> 00:10.210
It's hard for her to find

00:10.210 --> 00:11.678
a place to play around here.

00:11.678 --> 00:13.680
Yeah,her musical talent is a
wonderful gift

00:13.680 --> 00:15.949
and she needs
to bore <i>other</i> people with it.

00:15.949 --> 00:17.918
Let's face it-- classical music

00:17.918 --> 00:20.187
isn't the gravy train
it used to be.

00:20.187 --> 00:23.891
It's not like the golden age--
Vienna in the 1700s.

00:23.891 --> 00:24.625
In those days

00:24.625 --> 00:27.394
there were more orchestras
than consumption wards.

00:27.394 --> 00:31.865
And you were never ostracized
for eating a dead rat in public.

I'm sure she got this job.

01:09.136 --> 01:11.572
The school's having
a battle of the bands.

01:11.572 --> 01:12.506
I signed us up.

01:12.506 --> 01:13.974
I didn't know
we were a band.

01:13.974 --> 01:16.009
Every group
had to start somewhere.

01:16.009 --> 01:17.244
Usually in a garage.

01:17.244 --> 01:19.746
We can leapfrog that and start
in the gym.What do you say?

01:19.746 --> 01:21.048
We could have cool outfits.

01:21.048 --> 01:22.249
Yeah, we could work on some
dance moves.

01:22.249 --> 01:23.517
Put together a light show.

01:23.517 --> 01:24.551
I always wanted
to be in a band.

01:24.551 --> 01:25.953
Me, too. We're in.

01:25.953 --> 01:26.987
Great.

01:26.987 --> 01:28.221
So, does anyone here

01:28.221 --> 01:29.289
actually know how to play

01:29.289 --> 01:30.290
an instrument?

01:32.326 --> 01:34.328
I'm so close!

01:34.328 --> 01:35.796
Why don't you drop cold fusion

01:35.796 --> 01:37.664
and work on an ink
that doesn't stain your fingers?

01:37.664 --> 01:40.467
All I need is a formula
patented by Dr. Terdlington.

01:40.467 --> 01:42.369
Which means I would
have to call him

01:42.369 --> 01:44.037
and ask for permission.

01:44.037 --> 01:45.639
Oh no.Isn't he

01:48.775 --> 01:50.077
Exactly.

impression with her paper

01:54.548 --> 01:57.551

01:58.151 --> 02:01.822
but the winner is...
Dr. Clark Terdlington!

02:06.193 --> 02:09.429
It's been an unbearably long
evening of dull speeches

02:09.429 --> 02:11.465

02:11.465 --> 02:13.100
I'm better than you.

02:13.100 --> 02:14.768

<i>It was so unlike me</i>

02:30.717 --> 02:33.820
Oh just call him, tell him that
you've changed your medication

02:33.820 --> 02:34.655
and you're feeling better.

02:34.655 --> 02:36.356
That always works for me.

03:13.160 --> 03:14.961
She doesn't know that.
Yes, I do.

03:14.961 --> 03:16.296

09:58.131 --> 10:01.167
I hope you remembered what I
said about being mean to people.

10:01.167 --> 10:02.702
Zelda...

10:03.069 --> 10:05.171
have you decided
to forgive me yet?

10:05.171 --> 10:06.272
Not yet.

10:06.272 --> 10:08.975
Another one might help.

10:11.511 --> 10:13.279
( <i>whoopee cushion</i>
<i>making farting noise</i> )

10:14.647 --> 10:16.716
Ah, so close.

10:18.384 --> 10:21.488
( <i>crowd screaming</i> )

10:40.273 --> 10:41.407
( <i>both screaming</i> )

10:52.752 --> 10:54.320
Sabrina,I wrote a song

10:54.320 --> 10:55.155
for our tv debut

10:55.155 --> 10:56.723
but the drummer has a
problem with it.

10:56.723 --> 10:58.291
Take a look at it.

10:59.125 --> 11:01.728
Valerie, you wrote a song called
"My Valerie"?

11:01.728 --> 11:03.663
Wait till you see
what he wants to do.

11:03.663 --> 11:04.831
I drew up some ideas

11:04.831 --> 11:06.032
for a complete new look
for the band.

11:06.032 --> 11:07.867
That's you
and Val.

11:07.867 --> 11:09.536
Why are we dressed like worms?

11:09.536 --> 11:10.970
They're brown unitards.

11:10.970 --> 11:13.273
It's a comment
on an asexual society.

11:13.273 --> 11:14.274
And I'm

11:14.274 --> 11:16.409
the universal love being
with goat ears

11:16.409 --> 11:18.444
and the sleeveless spandex
vestments.

11:18.444 --> 11:19.345
"Love being"?

11:19.345 --> 11:20.813
But we can't sing about me.

11:20.813 --> 11:22.282
I'm changing America.

11:22.282 --> 11:23.049
Oh, yeah?

11:23.049 --> 11:24.918
Hold it,why are we fighting? We
are friends.

11:24.918 --> 11:27.320
Because he has a stupid idea.

11:27.320 --> 11:29.856
Oh, yeah. I'm not going to
perform dressed like a bug.

11:29.856 --> 11:30.823
This is my band.

11:30.823 --> 11:31.824
Both:
Your band?!

11:32.859 --> 11:34.127
Wait, we don't need
no pepper.

11:34.127 --> 11:35.995
Oh, no, this is
classical seasoning.

11:35.995 --> 11:37.597
It adds taste.

11:38.064 --> 11:39.599
How come you aren't playing that

11:39.599 --> 11:41.534
"Turkey in the straw"
I asked for?

11:44.837 --> 11:47.273
Do you know what
would be simply marvelous?

11:47.273 --> 11:49.943
Yes, some incredibly
obscure Wagner.

11:49.943 --> 11:51.711
If you insist.

11:51.878 --> 11:55.048
( <i>playing Wagner passage</i> )

11:56.516 --> 11:59.319
"Valerie, my Valerie,
foxy little junior

11:59.319 --> 12:00.887
"walking down the street.

12:00.887 --> 12:02.255
Valerie, my Valerie..."

12:02.255 --> 12:02.889
would you be

12:02.889 --> 12:05.892
terribly upset if I threw up
in one of your shoes?

12:05.892 --> 12:07.360
Salem, what will I do?

12:07.360 --> 12:08.494
You've always
been able

12:08.494 --> 12:10.096
to talk things
out with Harvey.

12:10.096 --> 12:11.631
( <i>phone rings</i> )

12:11.831 --> 12:12.832
Hello.

12:12.832 --> 12:14.267
Hey, Harvey,
it's Sabrina.

12:14.267 --> 12:16.769
Hey. So, you wearing
the brown suit?

12:16.769 --> 12:18.438
Uh, no. Listen.

12:18.438 --> 12:19.305
Hold on.

12:19.772 --> 12:20.740
He put me on hold.

12:20.740 --> 12:24.277
Since when does Harvey
have Muzak?

12:24.510 --> 12:26.613
Hey, sorry about that.

12:26.613 --> 12:27.981
I didn't know
so many chicks

12:27.981 --> 12:28.982
had my home number.

12:28.982 --> 12:29.983
You're listed.

12:29.983 --> 12:31.251
Hold on.

12:32.819 --> 12:34.687
Hey, sweetness,
let me dump Sabrina

12:34.687 --> 12:35.355
and I'll be right back.

12:35.355 --> 12:37.523
That's okay, goat boy,
I'll dump you.

12:37.523 --> 12:41.094
Oh, I wish I'd never given
them a swig of talent.

12:41.094 --> 12:43.997
It's ruining our friendship
and I can't even enjoy winning.

12:43.997 --> 12:47.367
Perhaps, you're feeling bad
because Libby sang with talent

12:47.367 --> 12:48.534
and deserved to win.

12:48.534 --> 12:49.369
Don't hit me.

12:49.769 --> 12:51.738
Great, now I feel annoyed
<i>and</i> guilty.

12:51.738 --> 12:52.972
If you want your
friendships back

12:52.972 --> 12:56.042
maybe you should take the fizz
out of the egos you inflated.

12:56.042 --> 12:57.176
I wish I could.

12:57.176 --> 12:57.910
You can.

12:57.910 --> 12:58.811
They sip
flat talent

12:58.811 --> 13:00.913
they go flat, too.

13:00.913 --> 13:03.516
Great, so I'll just let
these go flat

13:03.516 --> 13:05.385
and when I see Harvey
and Valerie tonight

13:05.385 --> 13:08.054
they'll drink and we'll go back
to being talentless friends.

13:08.054 --> 13:09.956
Did you pop one
for yourself?

13:09.956 --> 13:12.959
Me? I haven't been affected
by having things go my way.

13:12.959 --> 13:14.327
Oh, please

13:14.327 --> 13:17.430
little miss "I'm too cool
to do my history homework."

13:17.430 --> 13:19.332
I had an autograph signing.

13:20.333 --> 13:21.467
Okay.

13:24.470 --> 13:27.373
Libby, are you
here for the show?

13:27.373 --> 13:29.175
Please. I have
a date tonight

13:29.175 --> 13:30.910
and I left
my sweater here.

13:30.910 --> 13:31.811
I go to the carnival

13:31.811 --> 13:34.314
when I want to see
sideshow oddities.

13:34.781 --> 13:36.582
Maybe these won't be necessary.

13:36.582 --> 13:39.752
Maybe Harvey and Val will show
up and be their old selves.

13:39.919 --> 13:42.255
Please. Don't they have
roadies to do that?

13:42.255 --> 13:43.323
Drink?

13:43.323 --> 13:43.723
No, thanks.

13:43.723 --> 13:45.224
I asked for clear soda.

13:45.224 --> 13:48.795
And I don't see the blackened
tuna papaya hummus we demanded.

13:48.795 --> 13:50.997
Don't they know who we are?

13:50.997 --> 13:52.965
Come on, let's split one.

13:55.601 --> 13:57.637

♪ mi-mi-mi. ♪

13:57.637 --> 13:59.005
They're good.

14:00.406 --> 14:00.973
We'll grab some eats

14:00.973 --> 14:02.975
then I'll tell the others
about you joining the band.

14:02.975 --> 14:04.010
Both:
What?!

14:04.877 --> 14:05.978
Oh, hi.

14:05.978 --> 14:08.381
Sabrina, Valerie, I'd
like you to meet Sunset.

14:08.381 --> 14:10.683
You can't just bring
someone into the band.

14:10.683 --> 14:12.051
Especially named Sunset.

14:12.051 --> 14:13.219
You said.

14:13.219 --> 14:15.455
Listen, I'm the rhythm
section and I say...

14:15.455 --> 14:16.456
Oh, excuse me!

14:16.456 --> 14:18.358
Let's just have a drink.

14:18.658 --> 14:19.859
Here's your
four-alarm hummus.

14:19.859 --> 14:21.327
Finally.

14:22.095 --> 14:24.430
Sorry. Sunset says I
should only have water

14:24.430 --> 14:26.299
before a performance.

14:26.799 --> 14:27.834
Hey, Sabrina

14:27.834 --> 14:28.935
I just want
to tell you

14:28.935 --> 14:30.636
I think you guys
have what it takes

14:30.636 --> 14:32.438
to go statewide.

14:32.438 --> 14:33.239
Really?

14:33.239 --> 14:34.874
Oh, big bucks to be made.

14:34.874 --> 14:37.910
Wow, with a lot of money
we could help a lot of people.

14:37.910 --> 14:40.079
You could buy
a lot of stuff.

14:40.079 --> 14:42.281
Yeah, they could
always lose

14:42.281 --> 14:43.182
their talent later.

14:43.182 --> 14:43.750
Beg your pardon?

14:43.750 --> 14:45.051
Oh, nothing.
Let me talk it over with

14:45.051 --> 14:46.886
Harvey and Val.

14:50.423 --> 14:51.524
That's funny.

14:51.524 --> 14:53.960
I can't remember
how to hold a guitar.

14:53.960 --> 14:56.162
So long, lot of stuff.

14:56.162 --> 14:58.030
( <i>chuckles listlessly</i> )

14:58.631 --> 14:59.966
Beg pardon?

14:59.966 --> 15:04.370
A woman of my standing
enjoys caviar and fine wines.

15:04.370 --> 15:08.441
I could not have ordered
"rootin' tootin' beans."

15:08.441 --> 15:09.842
You did, Lorlene.

15:09.842 --> 15:12.278
And you threw in a "yee haw"!

15:12.278 --> 15:13.379
Beans, caviar--

15:13.379 --> 15:15.782
it all goes well
with Rimsky-Korsakov.

15:15.782 --> 15:17.650
( <i>plays "Flight of the</i>
<i>bumblebees"</i> )

15:18.184 --> 15:19.752
All right, let's get
some sound levels.

15:19.752 --> 15:21.187
All right, whenever
you're ready.

15:24.524 --> 15:26.192
( <i>playing badly</i> )

15:27.660 --> 15:30.596
Well, I see you guys took that
"Bad rehearsal-great show"

15:30.596 --> 15:31.864
thing to heart, huh?

15:32.298 --> 15:33.166
I'm sorry, Mr. Kraft.

15:33.166 --> 15:34.767
The guess the other day
was just a fluke.

15:34.767 --> 15:35.301
We'll just go.

15:35.301 --> 15:37.870
No,you just listen up, young
lady.

15:37.870 --> 15:39.839
Dwayne put his butt on
the line for this remote.

15:39.839 --> 15:41.307
Well remind me
to thank him.

15:41.307 --> 15:42.975
And when Dwayne puts
his butt on the line

15:42.975 --> 15:44.277
his mother gets testy--

15:44.277 --> 15:45.878
his mother,
who is my sister

15:45.878 --> 15:46.913
and the owner
of the house

15:46.913 --> 15:48.147
where I am
currently a guest

15:48.147 --> 15:50.216
where I am intent
on staying a guest.

15:50.216 --> 15:51.717
Got it?

15:56.722 --> 15:58.458
When did we
get bad again?

15:58.458 --> 15:59.725
I can't suck
on TV.

15:59.725 --> 16:01.494
You'd think I'd be good
at humiliation

16:01.494 --> 16:04.397
but it's just another thing
I failed to master.

16:04.997 --> 16:07.834
All right, Harvey you go help
Valerie remember how to a guitar

16:07.834 --> 16:10.036
and I'll try
to figure something out.

16:10.036 --> 16:11.270
And could you get
rid of Sunset?

16:11.270 --> 16:12.872
She scares me.

16:14.774 --> 16:16.676
Oh, if only I could really sing.

16:16.676 --> 16:19.312
If only someone
could really sing.

16:19.312 --> 16:20.546
Libby can sing.

16:20.546 --> 16:21.147
Wait.

16:21.147 --> 16:22.682
Is that really better
than embarrassing myself

16:22.682 --> 16:24.116
all over TV?

16:24.417 --> 16:25.852
Let's go with "Yes."

16:28.421 --> 16:30.523
I was just in
the girl's bathroom.

16:30.523 --> 16:31.891
What am I doing here?

16:31.891 --> 16:32.458
Isn't it weird

16:32.458 --> 16:34.527
when your mind is somewhere else
and bam

16:34.527 --> 16:37.930
suddenly, you're in a gym
asking, "How did I get here?"

16:37.930 --> 16:39.031
How <i>did</i> I get here?

16:39.031 --> 16:40.399
My point exactly.

16:40.399 --> 16:43.970
But since you stopped by,
I need a <i>little</i> favor.

16:44.270 --> 16:49.242
Hello. You don't know me,
but I just wanted to say

16:49.242 --> 16:55.948
Dr. Terdlington is a hero,
Zelda Spellman is a zero.

16:55.948 --> 16:58.451
Now on to the "B's."

16:58.451 --> 16:59.051
That's it.

16:59.051 --> 17:01.487
I am through apologizing.

17:01.687 --> 17:04.123
Either you give me the formula
or you go.

17:04.123 --> 17:06.559
You know, Zelda,
I've always liked you.

17:06.559 --> 17:07.560
You...

17:07.560 --> 17:08.694
what?

17:08.694 --> 17:11.564
Well, the science biz
is so full of phonies

17:11.564 --> 17:14.033
but I like your fire.

17:14.467 --> 17:16.202
Well, actually,
I've always admired you.

17:16.202 --> 17:20.840
Not your personality,
but your mind.

17:21.173 --> 17:22.909
Dinner?

17:23.142 --> 17:25.278
Love to.

17:28.114 --> 17:30.683
And you want me
to sing for you?

17:30.683 --> 17:32.685
In exchange for
eternal gratitude

17:32.685 --> 17:33.686
endless flattery

17:33.686 --> 17:36.055
and a piece of the
merchandising.

17:36.055 --> 17:36.889
I'll do it.

17:36.889 --> 17:37.690
You will?

17:37.690 --> 17:38.257
But let's get

17:38.257 --> 17:39.492
one thing straight:

17:39.492 --> 17:41.594
it's only because
I love to sing.

17:41.594 --> 17:43.429
And we love to
hear you sing

17:43.429 --> 17:45.798
'cause you sing
so very, very well.

17:45.798 --> 17:47.500
And you're pretty, too.

17:47.500 --> 17:50.169
Let's change "endless
flattery" to "cash."

17:51.170 --> 17:53.539
Send this ghastly smear
back to the galley

17:53.539 --> 17:55.274
and give the chef
30 lashes

17:55.274 --> 17:57.209
for his crimes
against eating!

17:57.209 --> 17:58.210
All:
Yeah!

17:58.210 --> 17:59.812
Man:
I'll never dine in this
establishment again!

17:59.812 --> 18:01.614

I'm appalled!

Perhaps a little Vivaldi?

18:03.950 --> 18:05.217
You know, it's funny.

18:05.217 --> 18:07.853
Without customers,
we don't need a fiddler.

19:06.245 --> 19:08.447
everything has
to be perfect.

19:09.382 --> 19:11.450
You're terrible.

19:16.188 --> 19:17.223
Well...

19:17.223 --> 19:18.791
( <i>coyly</i> ):
It's late.

19:18.791 --> 19:20.493
I suppose I'd better go.

19:20.493 --> 19:22.428
Right.

19:23.496 --> 19:26.065
Oh, by the way,
can I have that formula now?

19:26.065 --> 19:27.533
Nope.

19:28.234 --> 19:29.435
Never.

19:29.435 --> 19:32.271
Then why did you put me through
such misery?

19:32.271 --> 19:33.706
Revenge.

19:33.839 --> 19:35.107
How about dinner next Tuesday?

19:35.107 --> 19:38.244
How about you kiss
my cold fusion?

19:39.645 --> 19:42.048
Give me back my pants!

19:45.985 --> 19:47.620
So, are we still speaking
to each other?

19:47.620 --> 19:49.655
Yes, if we never talk
about how bad

19:49.655 --> 19:50.690
we played today.

19:50.690 --> 19:52.758
I can't figure out
what went wrong.

19:52.758 --> 19:54.460
Was there something
in that hummus?

19:54.460 --> 19:55.761
Let's just not let anything

19:55.761 --> 19:57.630
like this ever get in the way
of our friendship.

19:57.630 --> 19:59.532
You mean success?

19:59.532 --> 20:01.133
I don't think
that will be a problem.

20:01.133 --> 20:02.868
I blame Sunset.

20:05.037 --> 20:05.738
Sabrina:
<i>Salem</i>

20:05.738 --> 20:07.339
there are five
bottles here.

20:07.339 --> 20:08.874
That's very good,
Sabrina.

20:08.874 --> 20:11.477
Now, what color
is the tablecloth?

20:11.477 --> 20:13.379
No. I brewed six.

20:13.379 --> 20:15.781
