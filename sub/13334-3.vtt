WEBVTT

00:01.267 --> 00:01.468
.

00:07.173 --> 00:09.676
The Geordies are back in the Toon.
Wicked!

00:10.877 --> 00:13.646
We are doing what we do best.
Fuck me.

00:13.713 --> 00:14.814
Partying.

00:16.282 --> 00:17.717
Tashing on.

00:17.784 --> 00:19.285
Getting mortal.

00:19.352 --> 00:20.487
Shagging.

00:21.788 --> 00:23.823
It's insane!

00:23.890 --> 00:28.161
(yelling)

00:29.929 --> 00:31.498
Shit's about to get real.

00:31.564 --> 00:34.000
Have you missed me?

00:34.067 --> 00:35.702
Oh, my God, it's Vicky!

00:35.769 --> 00:38.505
She's the queen of this house.
She'll stir shit up.

00:38.571 --> 00:42.208
# I'm kissing Vicky
Scotty T is wicked #

00:42.275 --> 00:45.211
(laughter) No boy has ever gone
to this much effort.

00:45.278 --> 00:47.881
She's loving it.
I'm definitely getting a date.

00:47.947 --> 00:51.584
Gaz is fucking kicking off because
I've been speaking to Marnie.

00:51.651 --> 00:52.652
No, no, no!

00:52.719 --> 00:55.121
Next, tops are off
and we're face-to-face.

00:55.188 --> 00:56.623
You fucking told him!

00:56.689 --> 00:58.324
I knew this would happen.

00:58.391 --> 01:00.794
Scott tried to come between
me and Gary.

01:02.896 --> 01:05.498
All I want is an apology
from my best mate.

01:05.565 --> 01:07.100
OK, I'm sorry, I did.

01:07.167 --> 01:10.737
I'm not gonna let anyone fuck up
what me and Marnie have got going on.

01:10.804 --> 01:13.239
I do not want it to get complicated.

01:15.208 --> 01:17.577
I should have a degree
in pulling women.

01:17.644 --> 01:19.846
I am a Geordie girl with a VIP edge.

01:19.913 --> 01:22.549
I'm a natural beauty.
Real boobs, real hair.

01:22.615 --> 01:24.651
I'm gonna tear the place up.

01:24.717 --> 01:26.719
I don't kiss anyone
without a six pack.

01:26.786 --> 01:29.022
The hardest graft
I've done is my hair.

01:29.088 --> 01:32.559
I'm cheeky and full of mischief.
I'm fake, flirty and I've got FFs.

01:32.625 --> 01:35.228
I'll make sparks fly
and get everyone feisty.

01:35.295 --> 01:37.630
(all) Geordie Shore, why-aye!

01:57.116 --> 01:58.785
What's happened?

01:58.852 --> 02:01.187
Surprise, I wake up
and I'm next to Marnie.

02:01.254 --> 02:06.159
This is obviously not a relationship.
Definitely not a relationship.

02:13.533 --> 02:15.301
Yeah?
Yeah.

02:15.368 --> 02:18.371
Gary's convincing us that me and him
is just a bit of fun,

02:18.438 --> 02:22.208
but if that's true why does he care
about the boys going near us?

02:22.275 --> 02:25.278
Gaz admitted to me that
he's in too deep with Marnie.

02:25.345 --> 02:28.214
Like, he actually said that
to me last night.

02:28.281 --> 02:31.751
I think Gary and Marnie are cute
together when they don't argue.

02:32.952 --> 02:35.488
For him to admit he's in too deep,

02:35.555 --> 02:38.958
fucking hell, this isn't
the normal Gaz that I know.

02:39.025 --> 02:42.428
There must be something more there
between Gaz and Marnie.

02:42.495 --> 02:45.965
You never know, might be them two
walking up the aisle before me.

02:46.032 --> 02:48.468
I just feel proper minging today.

02:48.535 --> 02:53.640
So hungover and so rank and dirty,
I think we should go on a spa day.

02:53.706 --> 02:56.976
Massages, facials, yeah?

02:57.043 --> 02:58.645
Vicky's had an amazing idea.

02:58.711 --> 03:01.648
We should go for a spa day
and have some girlie bonding.

03:01.714 --> 03:03.216
Come on then, guys.

03:12.292 --> 03:14.360
The girls are completely on top.

03:14.427 --> 03:17.797
If this was a food chain
we would be wild lions

03:17.864 --> 03:20.600
dominating the area
and slaying our prey.

03:20.667 --> 03:24.203
This one has got Aaron literally
jumping through hoops for her.

03:24.270 --> 03:26.906
Aaron is trying to get
everything off the list,

03:26.973 --> 03:31.010
but I've already slept with him
so why is he trying so hard?

03:31.077 --> 03:33.880
I must have a magic vagina.
You know what Gary said?

03:33.947 --> 03:36.583
What?
"I'm getting too deep with Marnie."

03:36.649 --> 03:38.718
What?!
Yeah.

03:38.785 --> 03:39.852
What does he mean?

03:39.919 --> 03:43.756
I don't think he means balls-deep,
I think he means feelings-deep.

03:43.823 --> 03:46.759
I'm trying to avoid getting
emotionally attached,

03:46.826 --> 03:50.597
but I can't pretend it's not nice to
hear him saying them type of things.

03:50.663 --> 03:52.565
Are yous gonna go for a dip?
Yeah.

03:54.667 --> 03:55.868
Last night was fun.

03:55.935 --> 03:59.606
I had a good night and then
I thought Charlotte was coming,

03:59.672 --> 04:02.008
so I burst into tears.
I felt so bad for you.

04:02.075 --> 04:05.845
I miss Charlotte so much that
I even cried last night over her.

04:05.912 --> 04:09.148
I love the girls but it's not
the same without my best friend.

04:09.215 --> 04:11.618
I didn't want yous to think that
I was like,

04:11.684 --> 04:14.520
I wasn't having a good time
with yous because I was,

04:14.587 --> 04:16.789
I just expected her,
I don't know why.

04:16.856 --> 04:19.291
Even though me and Holly are
getting on well,

04:19.358 --> 04:22.161
I know as soon as Charlotte
walks through that door

04:22.228 --> 04:24.430
they'll be paired off
and I'll be on my own.

04:28.167 --> 04:30.103
(phone ringing)

04:30.169 --> 04:33.406
No sooner have we got back from
the spa than the phone rings.

04:33.473 --> 04:35.041
Hey, Anna.

04:36.409 --> 04:39.612
Is she kidding? I'm knackered,
the slave-driving slag.

04:39.679 --> 04:41.347
What's the crack?
Bar crawl.

04:41.414 --> 04:43.349
Me, Aaron and Scott.

04:43.416 --> 04:45.385
I love a good old bar crawl.

04:45.451 --> 04:47.720
No necking on
with any clients, lads.

04:47.787 --> 04:51.691
What about the staff, Vicky?
(laughs) You should be so lucky.

04:51.758 --> 04:53.960
(all exclaim)

05:11.077 --> 05:13.046
It's me, Scott and Vicky at work,

05:13.112 --> 05:15.815
I hope it's full of fit birds
so I can have a neck on.

05:27.226 --> 05:31.230
There's not a bird in sight.
Anna, what are you playing at?

05:34.200 --> 05:36.769
Scott and Aaron's faces
are a picture.

05:36.836 --> 05:41.474
They look like they've been hit
across the face by these lads' dicks.

05:46.279 --> 05:48.748
Let's see if they can
keep up with Scotty T.

05:48.815 --> 05:50.917
Shots, shots and more fucking shots.

05:54.120 --> 05:57.390
I've had more shots than
I've got tattoos, I'm smashed.

06:02.095 --> 06:04.063
Aaron is trying to tell me something

06:04.130 --> 06:06.866
and I'm pretty sure
he's trying to put a shift in,

06:06.933 --> 06:09.335
but I can't be certain,
all I'm hearing is...

06:09.402 --> 06:12.872
(garbles)

06:17.009 --> 06:18.644
(giggles)

06:23.015 --> 06:25.518
Looks like I'm proving
I'm still the new lad,

06:25.585 --> 06:27.053
just can't keep up.

06:30.323 --> 06:33.860
I think we should go out tonight,
see what's happened with work,

06:33.926 --> 06:35.528
they'll be mortal...

06:37.630 --> 06:40.466
We're buzzing to go out,
get drunk, bring it on.

06:40.533 --> 06:41.601
Go on then.

06:44.570 --> 06:48.040
We get to Florita's,
we're ready to get mortal.

06:50.409 --> 06:53.613
Gary comes strolling in like
he's going to his fucking prom.

07:12.064 --> 07:14.567
Oh, my God,
Aaron is not normally like this,

07:14.634 --> 07:16.836
he's clearly had
one too many tequilas.

07:20.072 --> 07:23.876
Aaron's being clingy again because
he's drunk, he can't help it.

07:29.081 --> 07:32.218
Aaron is flirting with Marnie
and it probably is harmless,

07:32.285 --> 07:34.153
but of course I'll get jealous.

07:38.291 --> 07:40.493
I asked her
what he's got that I haven't.

07:45.565 --> 07:47.366
Massive fail.

07:54.006 --> 07:56.242
Yet again Gary's getting jealous.

08:04.684 --> 08:07.620
I'm fucking sick of this arguing
and hassle with Gary.

08:07.687 --> 08:09.255
I hate him at the minute.

08:16.696 --> 08:19.966
This playground bullshit
has got to stop.

08:20.032 --> 08:22.869
Gary and Marnie
quite evidently like each other

08:33.913 --> 08:37.250
This whole thing is reeking
of Gary and Charlotte.

08:37.316 --> 08:39.452
Nobody wants the house
like that again

08:39.518 --> 08:42.587
and I can't help but think
we're headed for disaster.

08:51.364 --> 08:53.366
I don't know what it is
with the girls,

08:53.432 --> 08:57.670
as soon as they have a drink they'll
shovel anything down their necks.

09:06.512 --> 09:09.448
Aaron?
Fuck off, mate.

09:09.515 --> 09:11.050
(laughter)

09:11.117 --> 09:14.120
So I'm really fucking pissed
and I can't even speak.

09:14.186 --> 09:15.955
Why do I always take it too far?

09:16.889 --> 09:18.090
(laughs drunkenly)

09:28.367 --> 09:31.537
Me and Gary are getting nowhere,
but this is just me and Gary.

09:31.604 --> 09:33.372
We argue and then we make up.

09:42.048 --> 09:44.016
We're not in a relationship,

09:44.083 --> 09:47.453
but the last thing I wanna hear is
how great some other lad is.

09:47.520 --> 09:51.324
Urgh, I don't,
I don't like him more, right?

09:51.390 --> 09:55.127
I don't. I like...
You know I like you a lot more.

09:55.194 --> 09:57.930
The way Gary's going on,
it's really confusing us.

09:57.997 --> 09:59.665
He says he doesn't care,

09:59.732 --> 10:02.201
but he wouldn't argue
like this if he didn't.

10:02.268 --> 10:05.037
(sighs)

10:08.240 --> 10:12.678
I don't care what anybody says,
sex is not worth this much hassle.

10:12.745 --> 10:14.313
I'd rather have a wank.

10:21.487 --> 10:23.789
It wasn't baby oil, it was my spunk.

10:23.856 --> 10:25.091
(yells)

10:25.157 --> 10:28.527
I decide to bite the bullet
and make the first move.

10:28.594 --> 10:29.695
Oi-oi.

10:29.762 --> 10:31.397
Double date has to happen.

10:31.464 --> 10:34.500
How the hell can this girl
mind fuck me any more?

10:34.567 --> 10:37.069
(all) Geordie Shore, why-aye!

10:39.238 --> 10:39.438
.

10:42.074 --> 10:42.274
.

11:07.233 --> 11:09.969
So, I've woke up
and am I seeing things?

11:10.036 --> 11:12.638
Gaz is in his own bed, no Marnie.

11:12.705 --> 11:15.074
Guess there's
a first time for everything.

11:22.148 --> 11:24.784
She's doing my head in
and it's not fun any more,

11:24.850 --> 11:26.485
so I need to pie her off.

11:28.687 --> 11:30.923
You think?
I heard it from up here, babe.

11:30.990 --> 11:34.226
These arguments are getting too
out of hand and I can't cope.

11:34.293 --> 11:37.296
I don't think he's been
to this stage with a bird before

11:37.363 --> 11:39.799
and he's panicking, like,
"What do I do?"

11:41.734 --> 11:44.370
But your actions are
suggesting otherwise.

11:44.437 --> 11:46.972
Yous are like
an old fucking married couple.

11:47.039 --> 11:49.275
The line between
love and hate is so thin.

11:49.909 --> 11:51.377
Every girl has her guard up

11:51.444 --> 11:53.979
and soon as Marnie admits that
she likes Gary,

11:54.046 --> 11:56.582
that's it,
she's opened a massive can of worms

11:56.649 --> 12:00.086
and if she keeps saying she doesn't
she's protecting herself.

12:04.890 --> 12:07.626
I'm still trying to get Holly
to go on a date with us

12:07.693 --> 12:11.831
by getting everything on her list
and a star is the last thing.

12:13.833 --> 12:14.967
What's this, like?

12:17.503 --> 12:18.504
Oh, right.

12:21.273 --> 12:22.541
Holly?

12:22.608 --> 12:24.810
Yeah?
Can you come here, please?

12:24.877 --> 12:28.481
Aaron's calling my name
and I'm like, "Eh? What the hell?"

12:28.547 --> 12:32.918
I got you another present.
Do you know how you wanted a star?

12:32.985 --> 12:37.490
Right, I've actually named
a star after you.

12:40.126 --> 12:42.628
I'm so happy,
I can't believe he's gone out

12:42.695 --> 12:44.263
and got a star named after me.

12:44.330 --> 12:46.365
Aww, you're so cute.

12:46.432 --> 12:49.135
I've passed everything
and that means I get a date.

12:49.201 --> 12:50.302
OK.
Deal?

12:50.369 --> 12:52.037
Deal.
Sorted.

12:52.104 --> 12:55.441
He could buy the fucking moon,
he's not gonna bang her.

12:55.508 --> 12:58.611
He's just making himself
look like a massive tool.

13:00.146 --> 13:02.615
Bye, guys, have fun.

13:02.681 --> 13:05.584
Aaron's taking me on a date
and I'm really excited.

13:10.890 --> 13:13.726
So we pull up and we're
outside the tattoo parlour.

13:13.792 --> 13:15.694
This day couldn't get any better.

13:16.896 --> 13:19.098
We get to the tattooist
and she's buzzing.

13:19.165 --> 13:22.201
What are you after, Holly?
Shall I get a little star?

13:22.268 --> 13:25.437
I've decided on a star, it'll
remind me of the star he got me.

13:25.504 --> 13:28.140
I named a star after her
and got a certificate.

13:28.207 --> 13:31.844
It's located in the...
Sky.

13:31.911 --> 13:33.546
(laughs)

13:33.612 --> 13:35.714
In the sky.
Where else is it gonna be?

13:39.285 --> 13:42.454
I didn't think you'd go this far
to get the date, to be honest.

13:42.521 --> 13:44.690
It's fair to say
we get on better as mates.

13:44.757 --> 13:46.926
I just wanted to complete
the challenge.

13:46.992 --> 13:49.962
I just think we get on better
as mates, don't you?

13:50.029 --> 13:53.532
Oh, God, yeah, totally.
So much better as mates.

13:53.599 --> 13:56.068
Now that me and Holly have
decided to be mates

13:56.135 --> 13:57.636
I tell her I fancy her friend.

14:00.172 --> 14:01.574
Yeah.
A lot.

14:01.640 --> 14:04.410
Do you fancy her?
(chuckles nervously)

14:05.811 --> 14:10.082
Oh, my God, this is such crazy
information whilst getting a tattoo.

14:10.149 --> 14:12.017
I'm pleased Aaron fancies Vicky,

14:12.084 --> 14:14.420
because it means, for once,
on a night out,

14:14.486 --> 14:17.423
I won't have him clung to me,
it's Vicky's turn.

14:17.489 --> 14:19.558
Am I done? Yes!
Give us a look?

14:21.160 --> 14:23.495
Aww, I love it, it's so cute.

14:28.000 --> 14:29.201
Hello!

14:29.268 --> 14:31.203
There's one person
I know I can go to

14:31.270 --> 14:35.241
to get the best advice,
it's my granddad, Big Raymondo.

14:35.307 --> 14:38.677
Even though we were out
and they were off doing their thing,

14:38.744 --> 14:42.248
I just end up
back with Marnie all the time.

14:42.314 --> 14:45.251
That's what I was thinking as well,
what's going on?

14:45.317 --> 14:48.988
When I say I've only been getting
with Marnie, he looks surprised.

14:49.054 --> 14:52.491
That's quite scary when your granddad
knows you're a player.

14:52.558 --> 14:54.426
Hypothetical question for you.

14:54.493 --> 14:58.364
If you had Charlotte and Marnie
sitting there and you think,

14:58.430 --> 15:00.266
I've got to decide between...

15:00.332 --> 15:04.803
I would never do that,
I could have been with Charlotte,

15:04.870 --> 15:06.005
I didn't want to be.

15:06.071 --> 15:07.740
You're not getting the point.

15:07.806 --> 15:11.210
Charlotte's not on the shelf now,
she's in a locked cupboard.

15:11.277 --> 15:14.546
It's just about Marnie.
Say, "I like you."

15:14.613 --> 15:18.317
So that nobody gets hurt
at the end of the day.

15:18.384 --> 15:22.054
My granddad's advice is I talk
to Marnie and everything'll be OK.

15:22.121 --> 15:25.057
He's obviously never been in
the Geordie Shore house

15:25.124 --> 15:28.394
or tried to have a conversation
with Marnie. It's impossible.

15:32.064 --> 15:35.668
James, what are you doing, pet?
Handcuffing myself. Aah!

15:35.734 --> 15:38.404
I wanted to know what it felt like.
(laughter)

15:38.470 --> 15:40.839
Found these handcuffs,
I don't know whose,

15:40.906 --> 15:44.476
and I've decided to put them on
and now I can't get them off.

15:44.543 --> 15:46.545
Hey.
Oh, here's the lovely couple.

15:46.612 --> 15:49.548
I kind of just handcuffed myself.
Love's young dream.

15:49.615 --> 15:52.117
I can't wait
to show everyone my tattoo.

15:53.786 --> 15:56.889
Got a star.
Does that mean it's getting serious?

15:56.955 --> 15:59.958
I've just noticed
you and Aaron have matching tattoos.

16:00.025 --> 16:02.561
That's really, really awkward.
(laughs)

16:02.628 --> 16:06.165
So I decide to just make the whole
situation even more awkward

16:06.231 --> 16:09.134
and tell everyone that Aaron told me
he fancies Vicky.

16:09.201 --> 16:12.738
Aaron decided to spring something
on me whilst getting the tattoo.

16:12.805 --> 16:14.973
Er, he fancies you.

16:15.040 --> 16:17.376
No, I didn't... I said...

16:17.443 --> 16:19.478
That's what I said,
I'm not gonna lie.

16:20.746 --> 16:24.983
I know Aaron's timing's a bit shit,
he's just taken Holly on a date,

16:25.050 --> 16:27.853
but the fact is
I quite fancy him as well.

16:27.920 --> 16:29.555
I'm quite a tough nut to crack.

16:31.924 --> 16:35.794
I know, just give us
a couple of drinks I'm anyone's.

16:38.731 --> 16:41.266
All we ever do in this house
is get pissed.

16:41.333 --> 16:44.169
I've got a massive surprise
and they'd better like it.

16:44.236 --> 16:46.538
You're excited
to know where we're going.

16:46.605 --> 16:49.641
We can hardly contain ourselves(!)
I know this good place

16:49.708 --> 16:52.077
with these mint sleeping things,
a yurt.

16:52.144 --> 16:55.247
A yurt? What the fuck's a yurt?

16:55.314 --> 16:57.216
I think yous will enjoy it.

16:57.282 --> 17:00.285
You need to stop being
so closed off from the universe.

17:00.352 --> 17:03.789
Your mind's in a different universe.
(laughter)

17:03.856 --> 17:05.790
What do you pack to go to a yurt?

17:12.030 --> 17:14.366
Come on, everyone.

17:14.433 --> 17:15.934
Right, bye, house.

17:18.470 --> 17:21.205
Are you happy we're doing this?
I'm so excited.

17:21.272 --> 17:25.411
I wanna be at one with the universe
and take in what it has to offer.

17:29.715 --> 17:31.850
(laughter)
Oh, my God.

17:31.917 --> 17:34.386
Why does Holly
always chase the impossible?

17:34.453 --> 17:37.289
We all know James won't feel
the same way about her.

17:37.356 --> 17:40.893
Only probably
because we have a connection.

17:40.959 --> 17:43.896
The dick's inside her,
how can you not be connected?

17:49.668 --> 17:52.638
To be fair to Holly,
these tents look pretty decent

17:52.704 --> 17:56.108
and as a "well done" I'd probably
let her suck us off. Maybes.

17:56.175 --> 17:58.877
Who's in this one?
I think you're in that one.

17:58.944 --> 18:02.247
Roomies.
Roomies!

18:02.314 --> 18:04.750
Get in.
Ah!

18:08.454 --> 18:10.856
It's freezing,
so I've gotta make a fire.

18:20.032 --> 18:23.502
There's a thesaurus there
full of paper and paper makes fire.

18:23.569 --> 18:26.805
I don't need alternative words,
I know loads, I need fire.

18:30.209 --> 18:32.945
Let's play I Have Never.
I have never masturbated

18:33.011 --> 18:35.747
in the Geordie Shore house.
I have, like.

18:36.448 --> 18:39.885
Shower.
(screams)

18:39.952 --> 18:43.121
What did you slip on?
It wasn't baby oil, it was my spunk.

18:43.188 --> 18:47.292
Is anyone gonna catch me?
There's a gap in the blind.

18:47.359 --> 18:50.028
(laughter)

18:50.095 --> 18:51.930
Out of the door.

18:52.965 --> 18:54.700
It becomes clear that I live

18:54.766 --> 18:58.103
with the most disgusting bunch
of individuals in the world.

18:58.170 --> 19:00.572
I've never fancied someone
in this room.

19:04.243 --> 19:06.545
I think I've fancied
everyone in this room.

19:12.951 --> 19:15.220
Everyone's drank the drink
except James,

19:15.287 --> 19:18.190
and I can't believe
he never had feelings for me.

19:21.426 --> 19:24.296
I just think James
is just so full of himself.

19:24.363 --> 19:26.865
You can't pretend
you've never had a past.

19:26.932 --> 19:28.867
We've all seen it, we all were there,

19:28.934 --> 19:31.904
and denying that you ever fancied her
is just hurtful.

19:33.472 --> 19:34.973
Really awkward.

19:38.877 --> 19:41.747
James, you've fucked the whole game
and the mood.

19:44.349 --> 19:48.453
I can't quite believe that James
would mug me off like that.

19:48.520 --> 19:51.456
He's said that he didn't
fancy anyone in the house ever.

19:51.523 --> 19:53.859
Everyone at one point
has fancied someone

19:53.926 --> 19:55.928
and it was like
a kick in the vagina.

19:55.994 --> 19:57.729
Like, I'm not being funny,

19:57.796 --> 20:00.966
but I used to have sex with you
in a fridge in Mexico.

20:01.033 --> 20:02.534
Holly seems hurt by James,

20:02.601 --> 20:06.438
but what I'm most confused about is
how the fuck they'd fit in a fridge.

20:10.042 --> 20:12.044
Being here makes me miss Charlotte,

20:12.110 --> 20:16.081
cos camping and Charlotte are like
a bird and water, it's meant to be.

20:16.148 --> 20:18.417
It's really not
the same without her.

20:18.483 --> 20:20.285
I think she'll be back soon.

20:26.191 --> 20:28.527
Did you think that was
the best time?

20:28.594 --> 20:32.130
The girl I fancy is quizzing us
about the date with her best mate,

20:32.197 --> 20:34.766
this is awkward.
We've been getting on so well.

20:34.833 --> 20:38.203
I'm not even lying,
I proper love spending time with you.

20:38.270 --> 20:41.340
Since me and Aaron are enjoying
some proper alone time,

20:41.406 --> 20:43.609
I bite the bullet
and make the first move.

20:47.546 --> 20:49.381
Oi-oi.

20:49.448 --> 20:52.250
As if mine and Aaron's kiss
wasn't awkward enough,

20:52.317 --> 20:53.719
Gary and Marnie walk in.

20:53.785 --> 20:55.087
Double date?

20:55.153 --> 20:56.388
So I've just walked in

20:56.455 --> 21:00.058
on what looks like a very awkward
moment between Aaron and Vicky,

21:00.125 --> 21:02.761
so the only thing I can think of,
double date.

21:04.029 --> 21:06.598
Yeah. Double date has to happen!

21:06.665 --> 21:09.468
Just when I thought
Marnie wasn't speaking to us,

21:09.534 --> 21:12.537
now she's dropping the lines,
"We want a double date."

21:12.604 --> 21:14.906
How can this girl
mind-fuck me any more?

21:23.715 --> 21:26.518
So me and Vicky are in bed
and it's freezing,

21:26.585 --> 21:28.186
we cuddle and keep warm.

21:36.628 --> 21:41.066
So, we've had a fucking unreal night
in the yurt, but I'm mortal drunk.

21:50.609 --> 21:52.944
I'm shocked at
how strong Gary's staying.

21:53.011 --> 21:55.747
I'm the one who's not
supposed to want to have sex,

21:55.814 --> 21:57.215
he's supposed to want to.

22:07.526 --> 22:10.762
We're having a wicked time.
Sorry I'm late.

22:10.829 --> 22:13.799
Charlotte has just
walked through the door.

22:13.865 --> 22:15.600
This isn't a very nice welcome.

22:15.667 --> 22:17.402
This is gonna ruin everything.

22:17.469 --> 22:19.037
Where is everyone?

22:19.104 --> 22:20.739
Fuck my life.

22:20.806 --> 22:23.375
(all) Geordie Shore, why-aye!

22:25.477 --> 22:25.677
.

22:28.313 --> 22:28.513
.

22:35.320 --> 22:40.959
(sheep bleating)

22:48.333 --> 22:52.504
If them sheep are waking me up, fuck
it, I'm waking Aaron and Vicky up.

22:57.676 --> 22:59.277
(Vicky) Oh, good morning.

22:59.344 --> 23:02.881
I didn't think it was possible for
Gary to lie in bed with someone

23:02.948 --> 23:04.850
without having sex with them.

23:06.885 --> 23:10.722
The fact that me and Gary spent the
night in a bed and didn't have sex

23:10.789 --> 23:13.892
means more than if we did.
That's a big step for me and Gary.

23:13.959 --> 23:16.294
Who the fuck was pissed enough

23:16.361 --> 23:19.164
to even mention the word
"double date" last night?

23:19.231 --> 23:21.133
Fucking idiots.

23:21.199 --> 23:24.703
Somehow we got smashed
and agreed to a date.

23:24.770 --> 23:26.204
This could be a nightmare.

23:29.975 --> 23:32.210
Gary wants to have a chat
about me and him.

23:32.277 --> 23:34.846
This is definitely
the last thing I expected.

23:34.913 --> 23:36.348
All this arguing.
I know.

23:36.414 --> 23:38.483
Why are we arguing?
I don't know.

23:45.123 --> 23:48.059
The best thing for me and Marnie
to do now is chill out,

23:48.126 --> 23:52.497
don't pull anyone else until we
understand exactly what is going on.

23:52.564 --> 23:54.833
Fucking goodbye, yurts.

23:59.838 --> 24:01.640
Phone!
(phone rings)

24:01.706 --> 24:04.743
(Holly) I hate the phone.
(James) I never answer it, me.

24:04.810 --> 24:06.678
Hello?
"Hi."

24:06.745 --> 24:09.481
You all right?
"I've got a job for yous tonight."

24:09.548 --> 24:13.985
"It's a 24th party and I want Scott,
Holly and James to go, please."

24:14.052 --> 24:17.455
Thank God I'm not involved
in this Holly and James sandwich.

24:17.522 --> 24:19.324
Work time.
Who for?

24:20.292 --> 24:24.329
Oh, I'm always at work.
Oh, man!

24:26.531 --> 24:29.334
I'm so angry
I've gotta go to work with James.

24:29.401 --> 24:31.703
After last night
it's gonna be awkward.

24:31.770 --> 24:37.209
I do wanna know why he said that he
hadn't fancied anyone in the house.

24:37.275 --> 24:40.579
It's your perfect opportunity
to ask him, sort it out.

24:40.645 --> 24:42.013
He's such a giblet.

24:42.080 --> 24:44.883
With Holly, James and Scott
going to work tonight,

24:44.950 --> 24:48.720
it's the perfect time for my, Marnie
and Gary and Aaron's double date.

24:48.787 --> 24:51.323
Those are two words
I never thought I'd say here.

24:51.389 --> 24:54.492
We're gonna get candles,
fucking mood music,

24:54.559 --> 24:57.162
bit of fucking Bazza White
on the sound system.

24:57.229 --> 25:00.265
Tonight we're gonna ask
the lads if they fancy going on

25:00.332 --> 25:02.534
our double date.
The pressure is on.

25:02.601 --> 25:04.703
Hiya. Hi, lads, yous all right?

25:04.769 --> 25:09.341
We just thought maybes like...
Shock, she's gone quiet.

25:09.407 --> 25:10.809
(laughs)

25:10.876 --> 25:12.410
Spit it out, what the hell?

25:12.477 --> 25:14.379
I don't know why I'm so tongue-tied,

25:14.446 --> 25:16.982
I feel like I'm 16,
at the school disco

25:17.048 --> 25:18.383
asking some lad to dance.

25:18.450 --> 25:22.254
We're gonna plan something nice,
would yous like to be involved?

25:22.320 --> 25:23.889
Aye.
We're in.

25:23.955 --> 25:26.925
Good. So we'll see yous later.
How long have we got?

25:26.992 --> 25:29.761
You're not in a hurry.
We got plenty of time? Sound.

25:29.828 --> 25:32.797
Me and Aaron haven't got a clue
what they're doing.

25:32.864 --> 25:36.201
You're not going to a fucking dance
or something, are you?

25:36.268 --> 25:40.038
(sings elegant melody)

25:40.105 --> 25:44.809
Their idea of special is a kebab
and a cuddle, so I'm a bit scared.

25:51.449 --> 25:54.819
After what James did last night
I am not looking forward to work.

25:54.886 --> 25:55.887
Nice one, Anna.

25:57.923 --> 25:58.924
(Scott) Let's go.

26:00.792 --> 26:02.294
I can't walk in my shoes.

26:03.695 --> 26:06.164
Hiya, hun, you all right?
Happy birthday.

26:06.231 --> 26:09.467
The birthday girl's arrived,
time to get the party started.

26:09.534 --> 26:11.136
Come and get your present.

26:15.407 --> 26:19.010
I'm at work with James and the only
thing to make this less awkward

26:19.077 --> 26:20.445
is if I get mortal.

26:29.087 --> 26:30.088
Look at that!

26:30.155 --> 26:33.491
Haway, girls, who wants to go first?
Come to daddy.

26:36.328 --> 26:38.363
24th birthday parties are my bag.

26:38.430 --> 26:41.399
Book me in for the next one, Anna,
you fucking radgie.

26:44.069 --> 26:47.739
I can't take this any longer,
I need to talk to James.

26:47.806 --> 26:49.908
I need to get rid of
this awkwardness.

26:57.816 --> 27:01.720
You don't have to fancy everyone you
sleep with. Just get over it, Holly,

27:01.786 --> 27:03.755
you're not my flavour protein shake.

27:18.603 --> 27:22.407
Is that James's idea of an apology?
It wasn't what I was looking for.

27:29.280 --> 27:32.083
Are you? Yeah, I'm a bit nervous.

27:34.052 --> 27:36.988
So me and Vicky are setting up
for this romantic date.

27:37.055 --> 27:39.357
Will the boys
even appreciate this effort?

27:39.424 --> 27:41.092
Vicky, candles.

27:41.159 --> 27:45.163
The only time I've ever lit candles
before in my entire life

27:45.230 --> 27:46.998
was when we had a power shortage.

27:50.969 --> 27:53.204
I'm starting to get a bit nervous.

27:59.044 --> 28:03.281
Please, I'm gonna die if you are
fashioning serviettes

28:03.348 --> 28:04.983
out of kitchen roll.

28:05.050 --> 28:07.252
Me and Vicky have done
such a good job.

28:07.318 --> 28:09.854
The candles, the food,
this is gonna be amazing.

28:09.921 --> 28:12.023
The boys better appreciate this.

28:12.090 --> 28:14.125
Lads?
Yep?

28:14.192 --> 28:16.661
We're ready if you wanna come down.

28:16.728 --> 28:17.729
Oh, my God.

28:21.032 --> 28:24.135
I'm in shock. I can't believe
the girls went to this effort,

28:24.202 --> 28:27.572
but who can blame them
when you've got me and Gaz?

28:34.746 --> 28:35.847
Oh, my God.

28:35.914 --> 28:39.517
I'm the first girl Gary has ever
gone on a candlelit dinner with.

28:39.584 --> 28:41.119
Is this getting serious?

28:42.787 --> 28:46.291
Aaron drops the bombshell of
a second date and I'm on my starter.

28:46.357 --> 28:48.626
Since everyone's
dropping bombshells,

28:48.693 --> 28:51.229
probably a good time
to sneak in there

28:51.296 --> 28:54.065
that me and Marnie are
only pulling each other.

28:54.132 --> 28:56.968
We don't really know
how we feel about each other yet

28:57.035 --> 29:00.505
and we don't want to cause fireworks
or arguments or drama

29:00.572 --> 29:02.407
when we don't know how we feel.

29:02.474 --> 29:04.309
I'm not even her friend any more.

29:04.375 --> 29:08.413
So I said don't pull anyone else
until we know what is going on

29:08.480 --> 29:09.848
and how we feel.

29:09.914 --> 29:13.852
This has to be the closest Gary has
ever came in his life to monogamy

29:13.918 --> 29:16.254
and who knows,
the closest he will ever get.

29:16.321 --> 29:21.726
Well, congratulations, guys.
I feel like I should give a toast.

29:21.793 --> 29:24.295
Like maid of honour. (laughs)

29:24.362 --> 29:27.699
Cheers.
Thank you, girls, for the effort.

29:27.765 --> 29:29.000
Vicky's making a toast

29:29.067 --> 29:31.469
about me and Marnie not
pulling other people

29:31.536 --> 29:34.239
and to be fair,
we're having a wicked time.

29:34.305 --> 29:36.541
Go.

29:36.608 --> 29:39.377
Ah. Fuck, that's disgusting.

29:39.444 --> 29:41.279
(door opens)
Oh, ow!

29:41.346 --> 29:42.981
Fuck! Sorry I'm late.

29:43.047 --> 29:44.883
I'm back!

29:44.949 --> 29:46.684
Oh, my God.

29:46.751 --> 29:49.587
Where is everyone?

29:49.654 --> 29:55.160
I walk in, Gary, Marnie and this new
person are still all in their seats.

29:55.226 --> 29:57.328
This isn't a very nice welcome.

29:57.395 --> 29:59.164
Awkward.

29:59.230 --> 30:02.800
Charlotte has just walked in.
This is gonna ruin everything.

30:04.669 --> 30:07.005
You look lovely.
Hi.

30:07.071 --> 30:11.276
Hi, Marnie, how are you?
I'm good.

30:14.279 --> 30:18.583
Shit. I cannot believe I've just
made a toast to me and Marnie

30:18.650 --> 30:23.121
and in walks Charlotte.
Fuck my life.

30:23.188 --> 30:26.057
It's not me, it's you.
I've got to give it up with Gary.

30:26.124 --> 30:28.493
It's Charlotte, what the hell?!

30:28.560 --> 30:31.162
Now I'm being a slut,
a lesbian slut.

30:31.229 --> 30:33.097
Everybody is smashed.

30:33.164 --> 30:35.433
Cheers, babe.
Some things never change.

30:37.202 --> 30:40.004
(all) Geordie Shore, why-aye!

30:41.873 --> 30:42.073
.

30:44.709 --> 30:44.909
.

30:50.481 --> 30:53.518
Cheers, right, thank you, girls,
for all the effort.

30:55.853 --> 30:58.289
Ah. Fuck, that's disgusting.

30:58.356 --> 31:00.124
(door opens)
Oh, ow!

31:00.191 --> 31:01.893
Fuck! Sorry I'm late.

31:01.960 --> 31:03.828
I'm back!

31:03.895 --> 31:06.798
Oh, my god. What the fuck?

31:06.864 --> 31:08.967
This isn't a very nice welcome.

31:09.033 --> 31:12.637
Hi, Marnie, how are you?
I'm good.

31:12.704 --> 31:17.342
Shit, I've just made a toast to me
and Marnie and in walks Charlotte.

31:17.408 --> 31:19.444
Fuck my life.

31:19.510 --> 31:22.213
Where's Holly?
Holly, James and Scott are at work.

31:28.586 --> 31:32.123
I knew at some point that Charlotte
had to come back in this house

31:32.190 --> 31:33.725
and I wasn't worried at all,

31:33.791 --> 31:38.296
however, walking in on a double date
is very fucking awkward.

31:38.363 --> 31:41.566
Aaron, this is Charlotte.
I'm Charlotte, nice to meet you.

31:41.633 --> 31:44.168
You all right?
I'm good. What's happening here?

31:44.235 --> 31:47.772
It's a little bit of a...
A double date situation.

31:47.839 --> 31:51.843
Gary and Marnie are on a date.
To be honest, I'm not surprised.

31:51.909 --> 31:53.611
I saw it coming a mile off.

31:53.678 --> 31:57.015
I'll just be the, erm... guest.

31:57.081 --> 31:59.984
I'll get you a plate.
I'll just have a drink.

32:00.051 --> 32:03.821
What's been happening?
What hasn't been happening?

32:03.888 --> 32:06.024
I'm starting to feel sorry for her.

32:06.090 --> 32:09.294
She's sitting there like
an unnecessary third bollock.

32:09.360 --> 32:13.698
It's time to get her out of here
and introduce her to the tortoises.

32:13.765 --> 32:16.267
(gasps) Oh, my God!

32:16.334 --> 32:19.003
We knew you'd love them.
So, what's their names?

32:19.070 --> 32:20.238
Erm, oh, I don't know.

32:20.305 --> 32:24.309
What kind of introduction is this
if they don't even have names?

32:24.375 --> 32:28.012
These tortoises probably feel
as unwelcome as I do right now.

32:28.079 --> 32:30.948
So, what else is new?
Nothing much, babe.

32:31.015 --> 32:32.550
Waterbed, turtles...

32:34.686 --> 32:37.522
(laughs) So is that like,
official kind of thing?

32:37.588 --> 32:41.159
It's basically very new,
I should let her break it to you,

32:41.225 --> 32:43.895
but I think it's probably
better coming from me.

32:43.961 --> 32:46.698
I'm not bothered, like...
I don't think you will be.

32:46.764 --> 32:48.266
It's music to my ears.

32:48.333 --> 32:51.669
I'm pleased that Gary's moved on,
because I did a year ago.

32:51.736 --> 32:54.972
Are they pulling other people still?
Not one?

32:55.039 --> 32:59.944
He's not pulled anyone since he got
here. I don't think she has either.

33:00.011 --> 33:01.446
I know she's not bothered,

33:01.512 --> 33:04.048
but hearing that
he's not pulling anyone else

33:04.115 --> 33:06.818
and he seems happy with Marnie
must still hurt.

33:06.884 --> 33:10.421
What about you and Aaron?
Brand new, shiny new.

33:10.488 --> 33:14.225
So wait a second, I'm confused.
Is everyone in couples now?

33:14.292 --> 33:17.095
I've come back
and everything's changed.

33:17.161 --> 33:20.832
It seems like everyone
is near enough paired off.

33:26.237 --> 33:30.775
But at the same time, I'm gonna
put myself in her position.

33:30.842 --> 33:35.380
Regardless of how much she hates me,
I still can't canoodle with you

33:35.446 --> 33:38.850
every night when she's there,
I can't do that to her.

33:38.916 --> 33:41.719
I don't want to, but I've got to
give it up with Gary,

33:41.786 --> 33:44.188
I can't go near him
when Charlotte's here.

33:44.255 --> 33:46.958
Why is Charlotte still ruining
my fucking life?

33:47.024 --> 33:48.693
It's got fuck all to do with us.

33:48.760 --> 33:51.095
I could be getting married
in ten years time,

33:51.162 --> 33:54.365
standing at the altar
the happiest man in the world,

33:54.432 --> 33:56.868
Charlotte walks in as my friend,
as a guest,

33:56.934 --> 34:00.638
the girl will probably say, "I can't
marry you, Charlotte's here."

34:00.705 --> 34:02.874
It's just never-fucking-ending.

34:11.681 --> 34:17.487
Do not get upset. Everyone's happy.
Do you want a drink?

34:17.554 --> 34:21.559
Charlotte's been here three minutes
and I've already argued with Marnie

34:21.626 --> 34:25.295
after we were having
an absolutely wicked night.

34:39.310 --> 34:42.580
Vicky's suggesting that I go
and break the ice with Marnie.

34:42.647 --> 34:45.248
No ice is to be broken,
what is she talking about?

34:45.315 --> 34:47.717
I've just sat with her,
just said right,

34:47.784 --> 34:49.920
"Gary and Marnie are making
a go of it."

34:49.987 --> 34:52.924
She didn't flinch.
She didn't flinch?

34:52.989 --> 34:55.460
Not bothered.
You're free to do what you want.

34:55.525 --> 34:58.362
Even though me and Charlotte
don't like each other,

34:58.429 --> 35:03.134
I want us to finally build our
relationship and maybe make amends.

35:08.005 --> 35:10.341
(cheering)

35:10.408 --> 35:13.177
(all) # Happy birthday #

35:13.244 --> 35:15.580
Work has been an absolute success.

35:15.646 --> 35:18.483
Me on the other hand,
I'm absolutely fucked.

35:25.490 --> 35:28.826
Holly's an absolute mortal mess.
Are you joking?

35:28.893 --> 35:30.528
She's embarrassing.

35:39.504 --> 35:42.707
We might as well have
brought Holly in a wheelbarrow.

35:42.773 --> 35:44.709
She can't move she's that pissed.

35:56.554 --> 35:58.856
Everyone, to Charlotte.

35:58.923 --> 36:00.725
(all) To Charlotte!
(all whoop)

36:00.791 --> 36:02.927
Thanks, everyone.
Let's get this right.

36:02.994 --> 36:05.663
I'm on a double date,
Charlotte walks in, ruins it,

36:05.730 --> 36:08.966
Marnie's called it off,
I am dreading tonight.

36:14.238 --> 36:18.743
I need to add some more people to
this weird, awkward double date mix

36:18.809 --> 36:22.547
and I can't wait to see Holly!

36:25.716 --> 36:27.985
Is this actually Charlotte

36:28.052 --> 36:31.188
or am I that pissed I can't even see
and it's just a mirage?

36:33.925 --> 36:38.863
I'm so excited to see Holly, I just
wish she wasn't so bloody pissed.

36:44.735 --> 36:45.770
I can't believe it.

36:45.836 --> 36:47.638
My best friend has just got here,

36:47.705 --> 36:50.708
but I'm that fucking mortal
Vicky's gotta take me home.

36:50.775 --> 36:51.809
Night, Holly.

36:57.415 --> 37:01.319
Now Holly's gone home it's just
me and Marnie left. Great(!)

37:07.758 --> 37:11.329
Me and Marnie are having a chat
and I feel like it needs to happen

37:11.395 --> 37:13.831
because she obviously feels
very awkward.

37:30.715 --> 37:32.850
Gary treats Marnie
differently to me.

37:32.917 --> 37:35.119
He treated me like
a friend he could shag

37:35.186 --> 37:37.355
and Marnie like
a girl he wants to be with.

37:45.229 --> 37:48.399
What the hell? Me and Charlotte
are actually getting on.

37:48.466 --> 37:51.636
This is not what I expected tonight,
but I am happy about it.

38:04.315 --> 38:07.785
Now me and Marnie cleared the air,
I might as well with Gary.

38:16.394 --> 38:18.996
I haven't got a problem
with Charlotte being back

38:19.063 --> 38:22.667
and Charlotte shouldn't have a
problem with me getting with Marnie.

38:30.641 --> 38:33.744
Gary's trying to play
him and Marnie down,

38:33.811 --> 38:36.013
but he can't fool me,
I know him too well.

38:49.760 --> 38:52.430
Charlotte's up to her old tricks,
mind games.

39:01.172 --> 39:03.874
I thought she wasn't bothered.
This is all I need.

39:11.749 --> 39:13.984
Looks like I'm angry at Gary again.

39:14.051 --> 39:18.189
I don't understand why he gets us
so angry, I must just hate his face.

39:34.772 --> 39:38.409
If I've got two girls
having my life every night

39:38.476 --> 39:40.478
this could be my worst nightmare.

39:48.586 --> 39:52.089
It looks like Gary's new girlfriend
is really pissed.

39:52.156 --> 39:54.925
She's literally lying down.

39:57.762 --> 39:59.930
No sooner had I walked back
into the club

39:59.997 --> 40:03.134
than I find Marnie in
a fucking similar state

40:03.200 --> 40:04.568
to the one I left Holly in.

40:07.605 --> 40:10.775
It's blatantly apparent I'm
going to have to take her home.

40:10.841 --> 40:14.812
If my night's ruined, so is everyone
else's. We're all fucking going home.

40:14.879 --> 40:17.782
Vick, I'm getting in.

40:17.848 --> 40:19.450
(Gaz) Marnie!

40:28.092 --> 40:31.028
Oh, my God! Fuck me! Fuck, me neck!

40:31.095 --> 40:34.064
I'm back at the house and I've
fallen all over the place.

40:34.131 --> 40:36.333
Some things never change.

40:36.400 --> 40:41.005
Oh, cheers, babe.
What are you doing?! What on Earth?!

40:41.071 --> 40:43.040
Whistle posse.

40:43.107 --> 40:44.708
Everybody is smashed,

40:44.775 --> 40:47.511
but after the night I had
I'm making an early exit.

40:56.887 --> 40:59.290
Oh, she's on Marnie.

40:59.356 --> 41:03.427
Charlotte is absolutely mortal and
since she can't kiss any of the lads

41:03.494 --> 41:06.030
she decided to turn
her attention to Marnie.

41:07.665 --> 41:09.133
Listen...

41:09.200 --> 41:13.771
I'm snogging Marnie, so now
I'm being a slut, a lesbian slut.

41:15.239 --> 41:16.407
What?

41:19.276 --> 41:22.279
If Gary walked in now
and seen me and Charlotte kissing

41:22.346 --> 41:24.315
it'd be like
walking into a wet dream.

41:25.516 --> 41:27.685
(laughter)

41:27.751 --> 41:29.453
Yes!

41:38.929 --> 41:41.632
Cheers, everyone,
to Charlotte coming back.

41:43.000 --> 41:45.936
The first night has been
an eventful night.

41:46.003 --> 41:48.105
It's time to go to sleep.

41:49.273 --> 41:51.141
Things are going well with Vicky

41:51.208 --> 41:54.712
and even though Charlotte came in,
it hasn't spoilt our night.

42:01.852 --> 42:03.320
I ended things with Gary,

42:03.387 --> 42:06.457
then I argued with Gary
and now I'm in bed with Gary.

42:06.523 --> 42:10.160
What the fuck? I have to admit
though, I am happy about it.

42:15.866 --> 42:18.669
How's Marnie even remember
what happened

42:18.736 --> 42:21.272
when she can't remember
her own fucking name?

42:29.613 --> 42:33.584
Charlotte's been here a few hours
and she's up to her old tricks.

42:33.651 --> 42:35.986
Marnie has got no idea.

42:45.429 --> 42:46.764
I'm not listening to him.

42:46.830 --> 42:49.833
Charlotte's been lovely,
so I won't put up with that.

42:57.641 --> 43:00.411
I feel like I'm banging my head
on a brick wall.

43:00.477 --> 43:03.013
I can't even explain to
the girl that I'm banging

43:03.080 --> 43:06.283
that me and Charlotte are over.
I can't win.

43:24.668 --> 43:26.203
There's tashing on all over

43:26.270 --> 43:29.440
and I'm pretty sure
I just saw someone slip a finger in.

43:29.506 --> 43:32.843
Finally got Gaz back as my wingman.
I fucking knew it.

43:32.910 --> 43:34.878
Gary with a girl at each side.

43:34.945 --> 43:37.581
Two can play at that game
and I'm better at it.

43:37.648 --> 43:40.718
Why the fuck would someone
wanna be so fucking horrible?

43:40.784 --> 43:43.454
The F bomb, feelings.

44:11.615 --> 44:11.815
.
