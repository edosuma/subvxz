00:14.710 --> 00:17.626
Hey! Get your hands off!

00:17.669 --> 00:19.367
I'm exercising my
First Amendment right!

00:19.410 --> 00:21.108
What were you gonna
do with this?

00:21.151 --> 00:23.197
You can't detain me!

00:23.240 --> 00:27.114
What?
Interesting venue for our third date.

00:27.157 --> 00:30.204
I didn't think beignets
at Café Du Monde would impress.

00:30.247 --> 00:32.683
Welcome, one and all,
to the military...

00:36.732 --> 00:39.430
...the world's best engineers
and scientists.

00:39.474 --> 00:41.345
This definitely isn't doughnuts.

00:41.389 --> 00:42.651
No, it's not.

00:42.694 --> 00:44.348
Oh, no!

00:47.569 --> 00:48.918
Oh, God.

00:48.961 --> 00:50.485
Ma'am, what's the problem?

00:50.528 --> 00:52.356
Call the police.
It's a bomb.

00:52.400 --> 00:53.531
What? Did you just say...? Leave!

00:53.575 --> 00:57.274
Get out of here.
I'm gonna help.

00:57.318 --> 01:00.408
Everybody!
We have an active bomb

01:00.451 --> 01:03.759
on the premises.
Please clear the area!

01:03.802 --> 01:05.674
This thing will go off in less
than a minute, and who knows

01:05.717 --> 01:07.110
how much damage it can cause.

01:07.154 --> 01:09.591
Like I said, there is an
active bomb on the premises!

01:09.634 --> 01:12.811
Please clear the area
as quickly as possible!

01:12.855 --> 01:14.378
I'm a ballistics expert,

01:14.422 --> 01:15.858
but I have explosive experience.

01:15.901 --> 01:17.164
I think I can deactivate it.

01:17.207 --> 01:18.469
You have any experience?

01:18.513 --> 01:21.342
One day training.
How can I help?

01:21.385 --> 01:23.387
Okay, the key is to separate
the blast cap from the timer.

01:23.431 --> 01:24.997
It looks like there's
a couple false wires.

01:25.041 --> 01:26.956
Yeah, somebody knew
what they were doing.

01:26.999 --> 01:28.566
I can separate the elements
to give you a better look.

01:28.610 --> 01:30.829
This is ridiculous.
Let's run.

01:30.873 --> 01:32.440
Most of the wires
are yellow and red,

01:32.483 --> 01:34.398
but-but there's a single green.

01:34.442 --> 01:35.530
Looks right to me.

01:35.573 --> 01:37.488
That's my vote, too.

01:39.795 --> 01:41.449
Here goes nothing.

01:50.936 --> 01:53.243
Holy crap. I think that worked.

01:53.287 --> 01:55.376
Hey, Ben,

01:55.419 --> 01:57.421
you know how you said
you wanted to impress me?

01:57.465 --> 01:59.206
Well, consider me impre...

02:02.818 --> 02:05.516
♪ Boom, boom, boom, boom

02:05.560 --> 02:08.084
♪ Bang, bang, bang, bang

02:08.127 --> 02:10.347
♪ Boom, boom, boom, boom

02:28.974 --> 02:30.150
What do we know, Hannah?

02:30.193 --> 02:32.239
Device went off
at 10:04 a.m.

02:32.282 --> 02:34.154
Two dead. Seven
critically wounded.

02:34.197 --> 02:36.199
I was told there were
Navy victims.

02:36.243 --> 02:39.420
Seaman Apprentice
Ben Frisell, DOA.

02:39.463 --> 02:41.552
Seaman Apprentice
Neila Diseris survived.

02:41.596 --> 02:42.988
They rushed her
to Mercy Hospital.

02:43.032 --> 02:44.642
And the other DOA?

02:44.686 --> 02:46.688
Yeah,
Dr. Alice Logan.

02:46.731 --> 02:50.648
She was on-site to present
a seminar on modern ballistics.

02:50.692 --> 02:52.172
According to witnesses,

02:52.215 --> 02:53.782
she was attempting
to disable the device.

02:53.825 --> 02:57.220
Why would she do that?

02:57.264 --> 02:59.570
I believe she thought
she could help.

02:59.614 --> 03:01.181
According to NOPD,

03:01.224 --> 03:04.314
there were close to 1,000 people
in attendance this morning.

03:04.358 --> 03:06.751
Tragedy could've been much worse
if our Sailors hadn't helped

03:06.795 --> 03:09.014
clear the room.
Anything else to follow up on?

03:09.058 --> 03:12.192
There was a protest group here,
Survivors for Peace.

03:12.235 --> 03:14.019
Lasalle and Gregorio
are questioning them now.

03:14.063 --> 03:15.325
See if they found anything.

03:15.369 --> 03:18.023
I'm gonna join
Sebastian and Loretta.Okay.

03:19.460 --> 03:21.897
Over the years, I've worked
more than my fair share

03:21.940 --> 03:25.379
of bomb scenes. It's not
the chaos that gets to me.

03:25.422 --> 03:26.902
It's the smell, right? Ah...

03:26.945 --> 03:29.426
The heavy chemical residue

03:29.470 --> 03:31.863
leaves a metallic taste
in your mouth,

03:31.907 --> 03:33.387
and the human element...

03:33.430 --> 03:36.390
It's like cooked meat.
Stays in your clothes for days.

03:36.433 --> 03:39.436
Does that smell give us anything
to work with forensically?

03:39.480 --> 03:42.396
Well, there was a benefit
to the explosion being inside,

03:42.439 --> 03:44.136
there's more particulates
in the air.

03:44.180 --> 03:45.747
I'm getting cordite and sulfur.

03:45.790 --> 03:48.358
Can it help you identify the
materials used in the device?

03:48.402 --> 03:49.881
Yeah, and how they might behave.

03:49.925 --> 03:51.231
So some bombs
are, uh, directional.

03:51.274 --> 03:52.884
You've seen a Claymore mine?

03:52.928 --> 03:55.452
The ones that have "This side
toward enemy" printed on them?

03:55.496 --> 03:58.281
Yeah, well, this device
had a similar blast pattern.

03:58.325 --> 04:01.284
It was intended to explode
in just one direction.

04:01.328 --> 04:03.721
Unfortunately,
it blew towards the door,

04:03.765 --> 04:06.115
injuring anyone who was
still trying to flee.

04:06.158 --> 04:08.204
Suggests a targeted attack.

04:08.248 --> 04:09.466
Ah, it's too soon to tell.

04:09.510 --> 04:11.903
Able to collect any remnants
of the device?

04:11.947 --> 04:13.992
Nothing useful,
not here at least.

04:14.036 --> 04:16.343
Where else would it be,
Sebastian?

04:16.386 --> 04:18.301
The force of the explosion
was concentrated

04:18.345 --> 04:20.260
towards the door.

04:20.303 --> 04:22.436
Notice anything interesting?

04:27.005 --> 04:28.355
Yeah, there's a void here.

04:28.398 --> 04:29.921
Yeah, right where
Seaman Diseris was standing

04:29.965 --> 04:31.532
when the device detonated.

04:31.575 --> 04:34.970
According to the EMTs, she was
hit with a lot of shrapnel.

04:35.013 --> 04:37.973
Some of which may be
valuable evidence.

04:38.016 --> 04:39.235
Get to the hospital.

04:39.279 --> 04:40.845
Collect whatever you can.

04:40.889 --> 04:43.544
Sorry to keep you waiting.

04:43.587 --> 04:45.067
Lot of folks to interview.

04:45.110 --> 04:47.548
Not a problem. I know the drill.
Been through it before.

04:47.591 --> 04:49.593
A woman we interviewed earlier
told us your daughter

04:49.637 --> 04:51.987
was the victim of a
mass shooting, is that true?

04:52.030 --> 04:54.816
Yes. She was 18.

04:54.859 --> 04:56.339
Sorry for your loss.

04:56.383 --> 04:57.949
I'm not the only one.

04:57.993 --> 04:59.777
Everyone in my group
has lost someone important.

04:59.821 --> 05:02.040
Your group's named
Survivors for Peace.

05:02.084 --> 05:03.303
Travel around the country

05:03.346 --> 05:04.869
staging protests
against gun shows.

05:04.913 --> 05:06.915
We're not staging anything.

05:06.958 --> 05:09.700
We attempt to engage our
fellow Americans in dialogue.

05:09.744 --> 05:12.007
Anything else you engage in
at these events?

05:13.574 --> 05:17.491
My daughter was shot five times
with 300 PRC rounds.

05:17.534 --> 05:19.057
Designed for Special Forces.

05:19.101 --> 05:20.450
We're trying to bring attention

05:20.494 --> 05:22.626
to the destructive power
of these modern weapons.

05:22.670 --> 05:26.151
Incidents like this morning's
brings a lot of attention.

05:26.195 --> 05:27.979
Our entire platform
is about getting rid

05:28.023 --> 05:30.895
of weapons like this.
We'd never use one.

05:30.939 --> 05:33.507
We understand, but there are
dozens of others in your group

05:33.550 --> 05:35.378
who have a different opinion.

05:35.422 --> 05:38.338
Yeah, like a man that was
arrested before the bombing,

05:38.381 --> 05:40.122
appeared to have
a gallon of blood

05:40.165 --> 05:41.384
in his possession.

05:41.428 --> 05:43.647
Brock O'Driscoll is not a member
of my group.

05:43.691 --> 05:45.475
He's a bottom-feeder.

05:45.519 --> 05:47.738
He's trying to use our suffering

05:47.782 --> 05:49.349
as a way to make a name
for himself.

05:49.392 --> 05:51.351
And how exactly does he do that?

05:51.394 --> 05:54.092
Check his social media.

05:54.136 --> 05:56.530
He'll do anything for attention.

05:56.573 --> 05:57.574
Anything?

05:59.924 --> 06:02.449
My rights are being violated.

06:02.492 --> 06:03.580
I demand
to be released immediately.

06:03.624 --> 06:05.103
You're not in my custody.

06:05.147 --> 06:06.975
You're gonna have to
take it up with NOPD...

06:07.018 --> 06:08.585
after you explain this.

06:08.629 --> 06:09.760
I don't know what that is.

06:09.804 --> 06:11.414
It's blood, Brock.

06:11.458 --> 06:13.677
It's probably not human blood,
but I wouldn't put anything

06:13.721 --> 06:15.244
past you considering
your history.

06:15.287 --> 06:16.419
That's not mine.

06:16.463 --> 06:17.986
Officers found it
in your backpack.

06:18.029 --> 06:19.335
Assuming you were gonna go
full Carrie

06:19.379 --> 06:20.380
on someone at the show.

06:20.423 --> 06:22.512
I don't even know
what that means.

06:22.556 --> 06:24.296
Coy's not your play, Brock.

06:24.340 --> 06:26.429
Not after the videos
that you've been posting online.

06:26.473 --> 06:28.213
You're a professional disruptor.

06:28.257 --> 06:32.479
You perform childish
pranks at public events

06:32.522 --> 06:34.437
for as many clicks as possible.

06:34.481 --> 06:37.092
You're familiar with my work.Mm-hmm.
Yeah, I am.

06:37.135 --> 06:39.311
So is every law enforcement
agency in the state.

06:39.355 --> 06:40.487
What can I say?

06:40.530 --> 06:42.271
The public wants outrage.

06:42.314 --> 06:44.012
I give it to them.

06:44.055 --> 06:47.537
What I want to know is what made
you step up your game today.

06:53.064 --> 06:54.936
You think I planted the bomb?

06:54.979 --> 06:57.460
Why else would there be
a line of federal agents

06:57.504 --> 06:59.419
waiting to interview you? No.

06:59.462 --> 07:01.290
No, no, no, no.
No, you got me wrong.

07:01.333 --> 07:04.336
See, I-I create spectacle, okay?
Not-not carnage.

07:04.380 --> 07:06.991
Okay, nuance is
lost on us, Brock.

07:07.035 --> 07:09.429
You're gonna have to
do better than that. Look,

07:09.472 --> 07:10.560
there was someone else.

07:10.604 --> 07:11.953
He went into the museum
with a backpack.

07:11.996 --> 07:13.128
He came out a minute later

07:13.171 --> 07:14.259
without it.
He ran right into me.

07:14.303 --> 07:15.696
No one else noticed it?

07:15.739 --> 07:17.175
They were noticing me.

07:20.048 --> 07:21.353
Okay.

07:21.397 --> 07:23.051
I'm gonna need a
full description,

07:23.094 --> 07:25.445
and you better hope for the both
of us that you have a keen eye

07:25.488 --> 07:26.489
for detail. Go.

07:26.533 --> 07:29.274
This is a composite
of our suspect

07:29.318 --> 07:31.625
Brock O'Driscoll claims ran out
of the arms show

07:31.668 --> 07:33.453
minutes before
the device detonated.

07:33.496 --> 07:35.237
We're running it
against security videos

07:35.280 --> 07:36.586
and facial recognition.

07:36.630 --> 07:38.022
Could be a wild goose chase.

07:38.066 --> 07:40.024
O'Driscoll covering his ass.

07:40.068 --> 07:41.635
Could be a lot of things.

07:41.678 --> 07:43.550
But we got to follow every lead.

07:43.593 --> 07:44.812
We got two dead,

07:44.855 --> 07:46.204
a Sailor fighting for her life,

07:46.248 --> 07:47.467
seven critically wounded.

07:47.510 --> 07:49.817
And considering
the size of the device,

07:49.860 --> 07:52.167
we might've been looking
at a lot worse.

07:52.210 --> 07:54.430
Yeah. We're six hours
out from the bombing.

07:54.474 --> 07:57.389
There's 300 federal agents
and law enforcement officers

07:57.433 --> 07:58.652
working the case.
What do we know?

07:58.695 --> 08:00.654
Major arms show
in the heart of the city.

08:00.697 --> 08:03.134
Working theory is some kind
of terrorism

08:03.178 --> 08:05.180
or political statement.
Yeah, but there wasn't

08:05.223 --> 08:06.660
any chatter,

08:06.703 --> 08:08.618
according to the FBI,
before or after the explosion.

08:08.662 --> 08:11.316
Every weapons manufacturer in
the country was at this event,

08:11.360 --> 08:14.537
but the bomb was found
at Dr. Logan's booth

08:14.581 --> 08:17.714
on her table. You thinking this was
a targeted attack?

08:17.758 --> 08:19.716
I think we need to deep dive
our victims,

08:19.760 --> 08:21.718
especially Alice Logan.

08:21.762 --> 08:23.633
Well, what we know now

08:23.677 --> 08:25.548
is she is the foremost
ballistics specialist

08:25.592 --> 08:26.767
in the Southeast.

08:26.810 --> 08:28.508
Consulted with law enforcement.

08:28.551 --> 08:30.858
Testified at trials.
Taught a class at Quantico.

08:30.901 --> 08:32.729
Yeah, nothing
that's controversial.

08:32.773 --> 08:34.078
Dig into her personal life.

08:34.121 --> 08:36.341
Find any enemies, secrets.
You know the drill.

08:36.385 --> 08:37.908
You got it, King.

08:37.952 --> 08:39.256
What? Good news?

08:39.301 --> 08:41.259
Neila Diseris woke up.

08:41.303 --> 08:43.131
Okay. Grab Sebastian.
Go question her.

08:48.702 --> 08:50.138
How you holding up,
Seaman Diseris?

08:50.181 --> 08:52.183
Uh, I don't know.

08:52.227 --> 08:54.185
They said
I need to stay overnight,

08:54.229 --> 08:56.753
but I, uh, think I can go back
to base tomorrow.

08:56.797 --> 09:00.148
No. Surgeons removed 20 pieces
of shrapnel from your chest.

09:00.191 --> 09:02.237
You're not going anywhere
anytime soon.

09:02.280 --> 09:03.586
If you're here to
get my statement,

09:03.630 --> 09:05.283
I already gave it to the FBI.

09:05.327 --> 09:07.895
Actually, not here
to get your statement.

09:07.938 --> 09:10.288
Then, uh...?

09:10.332 --> 09:11.986
Well, the surgeons did remove

09:12.029 --> 09:13.465
the 20 pieces
of shrapnel, right?

09:13.509 --> 09:15.076
But there's still one piece
inside of you?

09:15.119 --> 09:16.991
Lodged near my spinal cord.

09:17.034 --> 09:19.123
They say
it's not life-threatening. GREGORIO: No.

09:19.167 --> 09:21.604
But it could be helpful
in our investigation.

09:21.648 --> 09:23.650
The fragment
that we're talking about,

09:23.693 --> 09:25.434
it appears to have
some numbers on it.

09:25.477 --> 09:27.218
And this could be
the identifying part

09:27.262 --> 09:29.003
of the cell phone
that was used as the detonator.

09:29.046 --> 09:30.918
Might help us find the suspect.

09:30.961 --> 09:34.530
I was listening very carefully
when the doctor spoke to me.

09:34.574 --> 09:37.228
Removing that fragment is risky.

09:37.272 --> 09:38.229
Yeah, we know.

09:38.273 --> 09:40.144
If the surgery went wrong,

09:40.188 --> 09:41.885
it could result
in permanent nerve damage.

09:41.929 --> 09:43.626
Yeah, we know that, too.

09:43.670 --> 09:46.629
Okay. You know,
but you don't care.

09:46.673 --> 09:48.239
No, no, that's not what
he's saying.

09:48.283 --> 09:49.806
Right? NEILA:
Ben was standing

09:49.850 --> 09:51.634
in front of me
when the bomb went off.

09:51.678 --> 09:53.288
Just ten feet.

09:53.331 --> 09:56.465
He was there, and then...

09:56.508 --> 09:58.641
he was ripped apart.

09:59.686 --> 10:01.122
Somehow,

10:01.165 --> 10:02.645
I'm going to walk out of this.

10:02.689 --> 10:03.951
It's a gift I won't squander.

10:03.962 --> 10:04.797
Right,

10:04.808 --> 10:07.312
but I-I don't think that's necessarily
the way to look at this, okay?

10:07.345 --> 10:08.825
You have the opportunity
to help catch

10:08.869 --> 10:10.087
the person who did this.

10:10.131 --> 10:12.699
Sorry. No.Look, Seaman Diseris...

10:12.742 --> 10:13.917
We understand.

10:13.961 --> 10:16.006
Thanks for listening.

10:21.142 --> 10:23.361
Any luck getting the
piece of shrapnel?

10:23.405 --> 10:25.668
Seaman Diseris refuses
to have the operation.

10:25.712 --> 10:27.670
Yeah, 'cause we didn't try
hard enough to convince her.

10:27.714 --> 10:30.325
She barely survived the blast.
We got to give her some time.

10:30.368 --> 10:32.414
We don't have time. All right?
The longer that we wait,

10:32.457 --> 10:34.372
the more the chances are
that the suspect gets away

10:34.416 --> 10:35.678
or worse, sets off another bomb.

10:35.722 --> 10:37.680
I understand the stakes,
Sebastian, as well as

10:37.724 --> 10:39.508
anyone else here.

10:39.551 --> 10:42.119
But we cannot force this woman
to put her life at risk again.

10:42.163 --> 10:43.381
You know that.Okay.

10:43.425 --> 10:45.775
We're gonna use
different methods

10:45.819 --> 10:47.255
to find our suspect.

10:47.298 --> 10:49.605
We can table that debate
for right now.

10:49.649 --> 10:51.215
I think we found our suspect.

10:51.259 --> 10:52.739
Got a match on facial
recognition?

10:52.782 --> 10:54.392
Oh, no, better than that.

10:54.436 --> 10:57.221
NOPD pulled up surveillance
footage from a coffee shop

10:57.265 --> 10:59.180
a few blocks from the blast.

10:59.223 --> 11:03.097
Alan Van Scyoc.
According to the credit card

11:03.140 --> 11:04.664
he used to pay
for his breakfast.

11:04.707 --> 11:06.840
Commercial
real estate developer.

11:06.883 --> 11:08.711
Born and raised in New Orleans.

11:08.755 --> 11:10.974
Not the typical profile
on a terrorist.

11:11.018 --> 11:12.976
Because he's not a terrorist.

11:13.020 --> 11:14.238
I read about this case.

11:14.282 --> 11:17.459
His brother Carl, right?

11:17.502 --> 11:19.591
Yeah. Carl is on
trial for murder.

11:19.635 --> 11:22.072
Accused of killing an unhappy
business partner. Carl and his partner

11:22.116 --> 11:24.074
were both shot during
an alleged carjacking.

11:24.118 --> 11:25.510
Prosecution says that Carl

11:25.554 --> 11:27.295
set the whole thing up.
Pulled the trigger himself.

11:27.338 --> 11:29.732
Entire trial hinges
on the testimony

11:29.776 --> 11:32.126
of the state ballistics expert.

11:32.169 --> 11:35.042
Dr. Alice Logan.

11:35.085 --> 11:36.304
Yeah.

11:36.347 --> 11:38.088
This would explain why
the bomb was set

11:38.132 --> 11:39.350
to only go off in one direction.

11:39.394 --> 11:41.483
To make sure Alice Logan

11:41.526 --> 11:43.485
didn't survive.

11:43.528 --> 11:45.139
This bombing had nothing to do

11:45.182 --> 11:48.142
with protesters or politics.

11:48.185 --> 11:50.492
It was a hit.

12:01.155 --> 12:04.288
Bus 35 going to El Paso
leaving in 15 minutes.

12:04.332 --> 12:06.464
Listen, I'm not gonna be able
to make it, okay?

12:06.508 --> 12:09.076
...to El Paso leaving
in 15 minutes.

12:09.119 --> 12:10.512
Well, you'll have to reschedule.

12:12.775 --> 12:14.908
Just apologize to them, Pete.

12:14.951 --> 12:17.954
Tell them, you know,
I got the flu.

12:17.998 --> 12:21.001
I'm gonna be home
in bed all day.

12:21.044 --> 12:23.220
Yeah. I feel awful.

12:29.749 --> 12:32.447
Hey, can I call you back?

12:32.490 --> 12:33.840
Something weird is...

12:42.370 --> 12:43.937
NCIS!

12:45.590 --> 12:48.942
Alan Van Scyoc.
You're under arrest.

12:53.294 --> 12:56.123
I don't understand why I'm here.

12:56.166 --> 12:58.212
That's incredibly
hard to believe.

12:58.255 --> 13:00.257
Considering you had $20,000 cash

13:00.301 --> 13:02.520
in your bag and a bus ticket
to El Paso.

13:02.564 --> 13:03.826
I was going on a business trip.

13:03.870 --> 13:05.088
You were going on the run.

13:05.132 --> 13:07.482
Why would I...? HANNAH: The bombing

13:07.525 --> 13:08.483
that killed Dr. Alice Logan.

13:08.526 --> 13:10.398
Yeah. I heard about it.

13:10.441 --> 13:11.486
You were there, Alan.

13:11.529 --> 13:13.009
No, I wasn't.
I had a meeting.

13:13.053 --> 13:14.576
Alan, stop.

13:17.100 --> 13:19.711
This is a, uh, composite

13:19.755 --> 13:22.279
from witnesses who saw you
entering the museum

13:22.323 --> 13:23.846
before the device went off.

13:23.890 --> 13:25.979
Doesn't look anything like me.

13:27.763 --> 13:29.069
How about this?

13:31.898 --> 13:34.248
- Well, that's you right there.
- In front of the arms show.

13:34.291 --> 13:36.337
With a backpack. What's in the
backpack, Alan?

13:36.380 --> 13:39.775
You think I'm involved
in this tragedy?

13:39.819 --> 13:42.343
We know you are. I'm a businessman!

13:42.386 --> 13:44.345
Where'd you get the components
to make the bomb?

13:44.388 --> 13:47.391
Why would I...? Dr. Alice Logan.

13:47.435 --> 13:49.263
She was about to testify
against your brother

13:49.306 --> 13:50.525
at his murder trial.

13:50.568 --> 13:52.440
Her ballistics evidence

13:52.483 --> 13:53.789
would've sealed his fate.

13:53.833 --> 13:55.443
That's just crazy.

13:55.486 --> 13:58.663
Yeah. Agreed.
Why are we here?

13:58.707 --> 14:02.580
You don't seem
like a bad guy, Alan.

14:02.624 --> 14:05.279
No record,
active in the community.

14:05.322 --> 14:09.196
Your brother, Carl, though...
he's not nice at all.

14:09.239 --> 14:13.243
He's been accused of blackmail,
extortion, fraud.

14:13.287 --> 14:16.420
Then he murders
a disgruntled business partner.

14:16.464 --> 14:17.944
They were in a carjacking.

14:17.987 --> 14:19.249
That's your brother's story,

14:19.293 --> 14:20.903
but we know
that he was the shooter.

14:20.947 --> 14:22.905
Look, somehow, you
got involved in this.

14:22.949 --> 14:24.864
Maybe it was family loyalty.

14:24.907 --> 14:27.605
Maybe Carl strong-armed
you into planting the bomb.

14:27.649 --> 14:29.607
I didn't do anything.

14:29.651 --> 14:31.653
No?

14:33.568 --> 14:35.657
You did... this.

14:39.356 --> 14:41.402
Please take those away.

14:41.445 --> 14:43.230
And this!

14:43.273 --> 14:45.623
Alan, dozens of law
enforcement agents

14:45.667 --> 14:47.930
are searching your
home, your office.

14:47.974 --> 14:49.453
Every detail of your life.

14:49.497 --> 14:50.933
They're gonna find something.

14:50.977 --> 14:52.543
They always do.

14:52.587 --> 14:54.110
Your only option right now

14:54.154 --> 14:56.417
is to explain to us
what happened.

15:01.726 --> 15:03.772
I think I'd like
to call my lawyer now.

15:11.954 --> 15:13.913
Lawyered up, didn't he?

15:13.956 --> 15:15.958
Yeah. I was sure we had him.

15:16.002 --> 15:17.612
Planting a bomb

15:17.655 --> 15:21.007
in a crowded space takes
a certain cold-blooded poise.

15:22.486 --> 15:24.619
Something about this guy
just isn't adding up.

15:24.662 --> 15:26.534
Well, Gregorio and the
FBI finished searching

15:26.577 --> 15:28.579
his home and his office.

15:28.623 --> 15:32.540
No sign of any bomb components
or residue of explosives.

15:32.583 --> 15:34.629
Okay, so he built the bomb
somewhere else.

15:34.672 --> 15:36.544
I mean, the guy was
a real estate developer.

15:36.587 --> 15:38.198
He had who knows
how many properties.

15:38.241 --> 15:40.635
Yeah, but... He delivered
the bomb, Dwayne.

15:40.678 --> 15:42.637
We have the evidence.

15:42.680 --> 15:44.552
You really think Alan Van Scyoc
planned this thing?

15:44.595 --> 15:47.207
I think he's displaying
classic signs of grief,

15:47.250 --> 15:48.948
but less for the victims
and more for himself.

15:48.991 --> 15:51.211
We need more proof. Well, ask

15:51.254 --> 15:54.823
and you shall receive. Sebastian
thinks he might have something,

15:54.866 --> 15:57.608
but he needs a DNA
sample from Van Scyoc.

15:57.652 --> 15:59.871
Well, I'm sure they gathered
something in the search

15:59.915 --> 16:01.482
of his house. Have Gregorio
bring it to the lab.

16:01.525 --> 16:03.136
You got it.

16:04.920 --> 16:06.487
So, I couldn't find
any significant pieces

16:06.530 --> 16:08.445
of the bomb at the crime scene.
Mm-hmm.

16:08.489 --> 16:11.100
And since Seaman Diseris
refuses to have the piece

16:11.144 --> 16:13.537
that's still lodged
in her removed... Which is her right.

16:13.581 --> 16:15.322
Which is her right.
I know. I know.

16:15.365 --> 16:17.628
It just... makes it
more difficult for us, you know?

16:17.672 --> 16:19.717
There's a piece of evidence
that's sitting there

16:19.761 --> 16:21.110
that could potentially
close the case.

16:21.154 --> 16:22.677
Can't touch it.Yeah.

16:22.720 --> 16:25.593
Right by her spine.
She's scared, Sebastian.

16:25.636 --> 16:27.769
Yeah, well, if it was you
or me in that position...

16:27.812 --> 16:30.728
But it's not.

16:32.382 --> 16:34.689
Well, you're right.
It's just this young woman

16:34.732 --> 16:36.865
who was out on a date
minding her own business,

16:36.908 --> 16:38.736
and then, like that,
her life changes.

16:38.780 --> 16:40.869
Okay, so you're frustrated
with her, and you sympathize?

16:42.610 --> 16:44.655
I don't know where I'm at.

16:44.699 --> 16:46.396
You know what it is?
It's the...

16:46.440 --> 16:49.269
it's the senseless
nature of it all, right?

16:49.312 --> 16:50.705
I mean, I know that I'm a cop,

16:50.748 --> 16:52.620
and I'm supposed
to have this armor built up,

16:52.663 --> 16:56.058
and usually I do, but it's just
when the violence is so random.

16:56.102 --> 16:58.365
You know, I mean, anybody could
have been caught in that blast.

16:58.408 --> 17:00.628
That's... that's what
I can't get used to.

17:00.671 --> 17:02.586
You never get used to it.

17:02.630 --> 17:04.545
It's chaos.

17:05.936 --> 17:07.635
Best way of dealing with it
is finding order

17:07.678 --> 17:09.550
in the chaos.
That's what we do.

17:11.204 --> 17:13.205
You said you found
something else?

17:13.249 --> 17:15.164
Yeah, I got pieces
of the backpack

17:15.208 --> 17:16.686
that the bomb was left in.

17:16.731 --> 17:18.298
Notably, the zipper here.

17:18.340 --> 17:20.734
And the zipper
can help because...?

17:20.778 --> 17:22.824
Well, you know this little
metal tab thingie at the end? Mm-hmm.

17:22.867 --> 17:24.913
That's really good for
scraping off epithelial cells.

17:26.480 --> 17:28.089
Which I did.

17:28.134 --> 17:30.745
Are you seeing if it's a
match to Alan Van Scyoc?

17:30.788 --> 17:32.921
And it is.

17:32.964 --> 17:36.185
Van Scyoc definitely
handled the backpack.

17:36.229 --> 17:38.579
Like I said, baby...
order in the chaos.

17:46.978 --> 17:49.764
The U.S. Attorney will be
indicting Van Scyoc

17:49.807 --> 17:51.026
this afternoon.

17:51.070 --> 17:53.289
He'll be going away
for a long time.

17:53.333 --> 17:55.944
Less than 24 hours between
a bombing and a closed case.

17:55.987 --> 17:57.772
Team did good work.
I'm proud of you all.

17:57.815 --> 17:59.991
Got to give it
to Sebastian on this one.

18:00.035 --> 18:01.819
He sealed the deal with the DNA.

18:01.863 --> 18:03.212
No, it was a team effort,
you know?

18:03.256 --> 18:04.909
I'm just glad we were able
to shut that guy down.

18:04.953 --> 18:07.216
Yeah. I'm gonna
update Director Vance.

18:07.260 --> 18:08.696
You should go home,
get some rest.

18:08.739 --> 18:10.132
You earned it.

18:10.176 --> 18:11.742
Let's get out of here.

18:11.786 --> 18:13.135
I'm beat. I'll drive.

18:13.179 --> 18:14.702
I still got evidence
back at the lab.

18:14.745 --> 18:16.138
Got to check it in
at the NOPD locker

18:16.182 --> 18:17.618
and make sure
all that's squared away.

18:17.661 --> 18:19.533
I'll come with if you want.

18:19.576 --> 18:21.230
No, that's all right.
I got it. You can go home.

18:21.274 --> 18:23.014
You did good work.

18:23.058 --> 18:24.538
You should be satisfied.

18:24.581 --> 18:25.756
Thanks.

18:25.800 --> 18:27.802
See you later.

18:32.502 --> 18:34.809
All right,
that's ten boxes at my count.

18:34.852 --> 18:37.203
Sorry, Lana.
I know it's a lot.

18:37.246 --> 18:39.030
Bunch of agencies dropped off a
few more right before I came here.

18:39.074 --> 18:40.684
It's the job, right? Yeah.

18:40.728 --> 18:42.599
Plus, I get to tell
everyone that I'm friends

18:42.643 --> 18:44.862
with the agent that broke
the bombing case wide open.

18:44.906 --> 18:48.257
Oh, I wouldn't say that. No, because you're
humble... and a hero.

18:48.301 --> 18:51.217
I'm not... Listen, I'm still
the same guy from game night.

18:51.260 --> 18:53.697
Okay? I still blow
on my 20-sided die three times

18:53.741 --> 18:55.656
before I roll it
just like anybody else.

18:55.699 --> 18:58.267
No one does that, Sebastian.
That's their loss.

18:58.311 --> 18:59.834
I'm gonna go get
the rest of the boxes.

18:59.877 --> 19:01.923
Okay. Um, and I'm
gonna make you a cup

19:01.966 --> 19:04.055
of my world-famous
hot cocoa. Oh, I'm down.

19:04.099 --> 19:05.883
Just, uh, can you use real milk?

19:05.927 --> 19:08.147
'Cause almond milk
gives me, like, a whole... Deal.

19:09.626 --> 19:11.802
Hey, Sebastian? Yeah.

19:11.846 --> 19:15.763
You really are an inspiration
to geeks everywhere.

19:35.783 --> 19:37.828
Sebastian?

19:37.872 --> 19:40.962
I don't think he can hear us.

19:48.143 --> 19:51.015
Sebastian, can you hear me?

19:51.059 --> 19:53.801
Sebastian, are you okay?

19:53.844 --> 19:56.760
No. I... I don't know.

19:56.804 --> 20:00.590
How is he? Oh, he's good to move.
No neck pain or broken bones.

20:00.634 --> 20:02.331
Need to get him to the ER.

20:02.375 --> 20:04.681
You hear that, Sebastian?
You're gonna go with them.

20:04.725 --> 20:07.162
I can't. I got to go find Lana.
I'm sorry, dear.

20:07.206 --> 20:09.599
She didn't make it.

20:14.735 --> 20:16.693
Chaos.

20:16.737 --> 20:19.914
You're in shock.No. Lana was right there.

20:19.957 --> 20:23.483
She was... she was gonna
make me cocoa, and then...

20:23.526 --> 20:25.702
chaos. Tammy was right.

20:25.746 --> 20:29.271
Okay. Look, you need
to go with them now.

20:29.315 --> 20:32.100
No. No. No. No!
I got to work the scene. Whoa, whoa, whoa.

20:32.143 --> 20:33.928
There is no scene.

20:33.971 --> 20:36.409
Firefighters
are fighting the blaze.

20:36.452 --> 20:38.715
It's... it's the evidence.

20:38.759 --> 20:40.804
We'll get in there
as soon as we can.

20:40.848 --> 20:42.893
We'll find the evidence. That's not... No,
that's not what I mean.

20:42.937 --> 20:46.114
I mean, the-the device
was in the evidence

20:46.157 --> 20:49.291
that I... that I brought in.

20:49.335 --> 20:50.727
You're sure?

20:50.771 --> 20:52.076
Oh, my God.

20:52.120 --> 20:54.601
Yeah, I'm positive.
I should've checked it.

20:54.644 --> 20:57.604
I should've checked it
before I brought it in. Look, Sebastian...

20:57.647 --> 20:59.040
It's not your fault. I got to get in there.

20:59.083 --> 21:01.434
I got to go in and see...

21:01.477 --> 21:03.610
Get him to the hospital now. Copy that.

21:03.653 --> 21:06.395
I should have known,
I should have done something.Okay.

21:06.439 --> 21:08.092
You're all right. All you have to do

21:08.136 --> 21:09.877
is let these professionals
take care of you.

21:09.920 --> 21:11.705
You'll be all right.

21:15.361 --> 21:17.014
If Sebastian's right...

21:18.973 --> 21:22.237
...it means someone...

21:22.281 --> 21:24.326
sabotaged all the
evidence we had

21:24.370 --> 21:26.937
against Alan Van Scyoc.

21:26.981 --> 21:29.288
According to ATF's
initial examination,

21:29.331 --> 21:31.464
today's explosive device matches

21:31.507 --> 21:33.335
the signature of the one
at the arms show.

21:33.379 --> 21:35.816
We thinking Alan Van
Scyoc made them both? Well, he's been

21:35.859 --> 21:37.339
in our custody
for almost 24 hours now.

21:37.383 --> 21:38.993
Even if he is the bomb maker...

21:39.036 --> 21:40.864
It's highly unlikely
he had the means

21:40.908 --> 21:42.866
to plant the second device
in our evidence.

21:42.910 --> 21:44.303
So, who did have the means?

21:44.346 --> 21:46.000
That's the million dollar
question.

21:46.043 --> 21:47.567
We need an answer
quick. I just spoke

21:47.610 --> 21:50.004
to the U.S. Attorney; with
all the evidence up in smoke,

21:50.047 --> 21:52.398
he has to let Van Scyoc loose. What?

21:52.441 --> 21:54.530
He's giving us ten hours
to make a new case.

21:54.574 --> 21:55.923
Well, clearly whoever planted
the second device

21:55.966 --> 21:57.359
wanted this result.

21:57.403 --> 21:59.187
We got to find out who. Well, dozens

21:59.230 --> 22:00.884
of law enforcement
and first responders

22:00.928 --> 22:03.583
handled that evidence. Get the names,
get the backgrounds,

22:03.626 --> 22:05.933
find out what connection
he had to Alan Van Scyoc. Which still leaves

22:05.976 --> 22:09.153
the question of remaking our
initial case against Van Scyoc.

22:09.197 --> 22:10.894
Working theory
is that he planted

22:10.938 --> 22:14.028
the first bomb to kill
Dr. Alice Logan. Who was going to

22:14.071 --> 22:17.031
testify against Alan's brother
in a murder trial.Okay.

22:17.074 --> 22:18.902
So we start from scratch.

22:18.946 --> 22:20.730
Recanvass, reexamine,
reinterview.

22:20.774 --> 22:23.864
Find a piece of evidence that
keeps Van Scyoc in custody.Okay.

22:26.345 --> 22:28.042
Is that Pride at the hospital?

22:28.085 --> 22:29.957
Yeah. He went to check
on Sebastian.

22:30.000 --> 22:32.786
Is he okay? It's hard to say.

22:32.829 --> 22:35.049
Sebastian checked himself out.

22:35.092 --> 22:38.313
Come on, damn it.

22:46.147 --> 22:47.888
Hey.

22:47.931 --> 22:49.933
Careful there, Sebastian. I'm all right.

22:49.977 --> 22:51.587
Not really.

22:51.631 --> 22:53.502
Just hoping to...

22:53.546 --> 22:54.851
see something that I missed.

22:54.895 --> 22:56.984
You're in no condition.

22:57.027 --> 22:58.420
Uh, doctor said I'm fine.

22:58.464 --> 22:59.943
Doctor said you have
a concussion.

22:59.987 --> 23:01.728
They're just being cautious.

23:01.771 --> 23:03.338
So am I, get down.

23:05.906 --> 23:07.560
Okay.

23:09.039 --> 23:11.302
Find you a place
to sit down, okay?

23:11.346 --> 23:13.566
Just stay there.Okay.

23:16.612 --> 23:19.093
You know that, uh,
three percent of the population

23:19.136 --> 23:20.660
are sociopaths?

23:23.010 --> 23:25.099
Was it four percent?
It was three percent.

23:25.142 --> 23:27.493
I think I read that somewhere.

23:27.536 --> 23:28.929
Where you going with this?

23:28.972 --> 23:30.931
They're just the ones that...

23:30.974 --> 23:32.802
cause most of the suffering
in the world.

23:32.846 --> 23:37.590
You know, thieves,
con men, murderers...

23:37.633 --> 23:39.766
Just three percent.

23:39.809 --> 23:41.376
It sucks.

23:41.420 --> 23:44.031
They do keep us
busy, don't they?

23:44.074 --> 23:46.860
Yeah, I'm not gonna
stand back and let...

23:46.903 --> 23:48.905
a couple of people do all this.

23:48.949 --> 23:50.907
Appreciate your dedication,
Sebastian,

23:50.951 --> 23:53.388
but you're not 100%...I'm fine.

23:55.042 --> 23:56.478
Your nose is bleeding.

24:07.707 --> 24:09.056
Find anything new here?

24:09.099 --> 24:10.710
No.

24:10.753 --> 24:12.146
Whole thing's been picked over

24:12.189 --> 24:14.496
by every forensic investigator
in the city.

24:14.540 --> 24:17.064
But, uh...

24:17.107 --> 24:19.066
when I was climbing the ladder,

24:19.109 --> 24:20.937
I got hit by something.

24:20.981 --> 24:23.331
Yeah, dizziness. Yeah, well.

24:23.374 --> 24:26.160
Something else.

24:26.203 --> 24:29.859
If we gather every scrap
of digital data...

24:29.903 --> 24:32.862
I'm talking surveillance,
traffic cams,

24:32.906 --> 24:34.647
cell phones from the attendees
and the protesters,

24:34.690 --> 24:36.649
everything in a,
in a five-block radius...

24:36.692 --> 24:38.738
The investigators already
went through all that. Well, yeah.

24:38.781 --> 24:41.523
Individually. Looking for
one single suspect, Alan.

24:41.567 --> 24:43.133
Now we know that he had help.

24:43.177 --> 24:45.048
So if we gather all the data

24:45.092 --> 24:47.094
in one place...

24:47.137 --> 24:50.532
I might be able to recreate
the morning virtually.

24:50.576 --> 24:52.621
Maybe see something
that we missed the first time.

24:52.665 --> 24:54.841
You really up for this?

24:54.884 --> 24:57.496
They killed Lana, Pride.

24:58.497 --> 25:00.237
She was

25:00.281 --> 25:02.805
funny and sweet,

25:02.849 --> 25:04.633
and she was...

25:04.677 --> 25:06.635
working on her master's
degree, you know?

25:06.679 --> 25:09.203
And now she's...

25:09.246 --> 25:11.248
she's just gone.

25:14.643 --> 25:16.602
Your nose is bleeding again.

25:21.650 --> 25:22.999
It's funny.
I used to get queasy

25:23.043 --> 25:26.220
whenever I would get
a nosebleed, but now...

25:26.263 --> 25:28.483
now I don't feel anything.

25:29.528 --> 25:31.530
Okay.

25:31.573 --> 25:33.532
Let's give your idea a try.

25:33.575 --> 25:35.098
Come on.

25:39.059 --> 25:42.105
We have reexamined every detail
of Alan Van Scyoc's life.

25:42.149 --> 25:43.454
Not a scrap of evidence

25:43.498 --> 25:45.021
that connects him
to either of the bombings.

25:45.065 --> 25:47.154
Doesn't make any sense. There's
got to be something else

25:47.197 --> 25:49.112
that connects him or... Or his brother,

25:49.156 --> 25:50.592
who currently resides
in the parish jail.

25:50.636 --> 25:52.115
Yeah. Alan been in
contact with him? No.

25:52.159 --> 25:55.510
No, only contact Carl
has had is with the lawyers

25:55.554 --> 25:56.946
or witnesses for his defense.

25:56.990 --> 25:59.906
Well, hopefully Sebastian can...

25:59.949 --> 26:01.821
get inspiration here and
can give us a leg up.

26:01.864 --> 26:04.432
We're running out of time before
Alan's released from custody.

26:04.475 --> 26:06.260
We'll set up a task force
for Sebastian.

26:06.303 --> 26:08.697
Two dozen investigators
putting together footage

26:08.741 --> 26:10.743
from cell phones,
security cameras

26:10.786 --> 26:13.310
taken from around the time
of the museum bombing.

26:13.354 --> 26:14.573
You think it'll work?

26:14.616 --> 26:15.791
Well, about to find out.

26:15.835 --> 26:17.619
Oh, good, you're here.

26:17.663 --> 26:19.229
Uh, guys, can we have the room
for a minute,

26:19.273 --> 26:21.449
please? Thanks.

26:21.492 --> 26:23.538
This mean you found something?

26:23.582 --> 26:25.366
Just wait for it.
I got a whole thing planned.

26:25.409 --> 26:27.324
We don't really have time
for showmanship.

26:27.368 --> 26:28.674
Oh, I promise it's worth it.

26:31.198 --> 26:32.982
Even I was impressed.

26:37.291 --> 26:38.988
How did you...?

26:39.032 --> 26:41.643
So, we used the phones of all
the witnesses and the attendees

26:41.687 --> 26:43.340
and combined it all
into sort of, like, a...

26:43.384 --> 26:44.864
a Voltron of digital data.

26:44.907 --> 26:46.605
So, what is a Voltron?

26:46.648 --> 26:48.084
I'll explain that
more in-depth later.

26:48.128 --> 26:49.695
Right now just-just
watch what we got here.

26:49.738 --> 26:51.914
Now, we don't have
permission from everyone

26:51.958 --> 26:54.264
to use their phones.
But we accessed them anyway.

26:54.308 --> 26:56.092
"Accessed" as in hacked?

26:56.136 --> 26:58.138
Well, we needed a
complete picture here.

26:58.181 --> 26:59.705
Yet it's inadmissible.

26:59.748 --> 27:02.664
I know. Uh,
just-just watch it, okay?

27:04.144 --> 27:07.103
So, this is a 3-D rendering
combining all the footage

27:07.147 --> 27:09.453
that's basically about
30 minutes before the bombing.

27:09.497 --> 27:10.890
And we can literally navigate

27:10.933 --> 27:12.935
through the crowds
and the streets.

27:20.943 --> 27:23.076
Alan Van Scyoc is
in here somewhere?

27:23.119 --> 27:25.252
Yeah, I'm glad that you asked.
P, will you do the honors, please?

27:28.951 --> 27:30.474
Now, this is 20 minutes

27:30.518 --> 27:32.999
before Alan entered into the
museum with the backpack.

27:33.042 --> 27:36.698
And this second suspect
is handing it to him.

27:36.742 --> 27:39.092
Alan doesn't look
too happy about it.

27:39.135 --> 27:41.181
Yeah. I think Alan
was coerced here.

27:41.224 --> 27:42.356
Can we get a better angle

27:42.399 --> 27:43.357
of suspect number two?

27:49.450 --> 27:50.886
How's that?

27:50.930 --> 27:52.279
So, I already started
facial recognition.

27:52.322 --> 27:54.063
But that...

27:54.107 --> 27:56.239
that's got to be our mastermind.

27:57.284 --> 28:00.679
Okay. Who is this guy?

28:03.943 --> 28:06.032
His name is Colton Wolf.

28:06.075 --> 28:07.163
Former ATF.

28:07.207 --> 28:09.383
Bomb expert as well
as ballistics.

28:09.426 --> 28:11.211
Yeah, he was head
of the Texas State Crime Lab

28:11.254 --> 28:12.473
until about 18 months ago

28:12.516 --> 28:13.909
when he was fired for cause.

28:13.953 --> 28:15.781
Yeah. Ballistics was
called into question.

28:15.824 --> 28:18.435
He was cutting corners, and when
the scandal came to light...

28:18.479 --> 28:20.263
Dozens of cases thrown out.

28:20.307 --> 28:21.917
Suspects released. Lawsuits.

28:21.961 --> 28:23.702
Wolf's career was ruined.

28:23.745 --> 28:26.356
Guess who was in charge of the
investigation when he got fired?

28:26.400 --> 28:28.619
Dr. Alice Logan.Yep.

28:28.663 --> 28:30.012
So there was a motive
for murder.

28:30.056 --> 28:31.318
Revenge.Yeah.

28:31.361 --> 28:33.276
He had the expertise
to make both devices.

28:33.320 --> 28:34.930
First one he used
to murder Dr. Logan,

28:34.974 --> 28:36.279
and the second to, uh...

28:36.323 --> 28:38.673
destroy evidence.

28:38.717 --> 28:41.110
Any idea where Colton Wolf is? LASALLE:
We're still working on it.

28:41.154 --> 28:44.026
Texas Rangers went to his house.
He's not there.

28:44.070 --> 28:46.420
What does this have to do
with Alan Van Scyoc?

28:46.463 --> 28:47.726
Not Alan. His brother Carl.

28:47.769 --> 28:49.379
Hired Wolf

28:49.423 --> 28:51.425
as an expert witness
in his murder trial.

28:51.468 --> 28:53.993
They had multiple meetings
at the parish jail.

28:54.036 --> 28:56.909
And more than likely hatched
a plan to take out Dr. Logan.

28:56.952 --> 28:58.737
Unfortunately, we can't use any

28:58.780 --> 29:00.782
of Sebastian's videos. All of
our evidence is circumstantial.

29:00.826 --> 29:02.784
And whether Alan
was part of the plan

29:02.828 --> 29:04.655
or just a patsy, we can't tell.

29:04.699 --> 29:07.571
He's not gonna talk to us
while he's in custody.

29:07.615 --> 29:10.574
Plus, he's about to be
released, which means

29:10.618 --> 29:12.402
he'll probably disappear.
Yeah, they both will.

29:12.446 --> 29:15.579
We need hard evidence
to prove Wolf's involvement.

29:15.623 --> 29:17.364
Seb...

29:19.279 --> 29:21.281
Where'd he go?

29:26.068 --> 29:28.027
Making a break for it, huh?

29:30.072 --> 29:32.031
I can walk on my own,
and I can heal at home.

29:32.074 --> 29:33.684
Hospital can use the room
for someone

29:33.728 --> 29:36.035
who needs it. But youneed it.

29:36.078 --> 29:38.211
The evidence

29:38.254 --> 29:39.995
in your body is the only way
to catch two killers.

29:41.823 --> 29:44.783
I can't let you leave.

29:56.098 --> 29:57.970
You're not gonna strong-arm me

29:58.013 --> 29:59.972
into having
a dangerous operation.

30:00.015 --> 30:01.669
Yeah, you're right.

30:01.712 --> 30:04.846
That-that wouldn't be my place.

30:04.890 --> 30:08.067
But I just want to talk.

30:08.110 --> 30:09.459
I've got nothing left to say.

30:09.503 --> 30:10.852
Okay, I'll talk.

30:10.896 --> 30:13.072
Um...

30:13.115 --> 30:15.857
I was completely out
of line yesterday

30:15.901 --> 30:17.641
when I tried to force
you to cooperate.

30:17.685 --> 30:19.818
I didn't understand what
you had been through.

30:19.861 --> 30:22.255
I do now.

30:23.299 --> 30:25.258
And how's that?

30:26.302 --> 30:29.262
I just went through it, too.

30:29.305 --> 30:32.091
The second bombing. I was there.

30:32.134 --> 30:34.876
My friend died and, uh...

30:34.920 --> 30:37.531
changed everything.

30:38.749 --> 30:42.405
Well, then,
you should have the operation.

30:42.449 --> 30:44.625
Trust me, Neila, I would
if I could, all right?

30:44.668 --> 30:46.714
I guess that's where
our experiences...

30:46.757 --> 30:48.803
they differ.

30:48.847 --> 30:51.327
So there's nothing left to say.

30:51.371 --> 30:52.851
You're scared.

30:52.894 --> 30:54.591
All right, I get it.
You want more time.

30:54.635 --> 30:56.506
I would, too. But-but
we don't have any,

30:56.550 --> 30:58.900
and I'm-I'm worried.

31:00.946 --> 31:02.904
About what?

31:02.948 --> 31:05.864
Honestly? Uh, pretty much
everything in my life.

31:05.907 --> 31:08.823
You know,
am I gonna be late for work?

31:08.867 --> 31:10.303
Did I leave the stove on?

31:10.346 --> 31:12.827
Did I annotate my senior year
thesis rigorously enough?

31:12.871 --> 31:14.916
What?

31:14.960 --> 31:16.787
It's just, I'm a worrier, okay?

31:16.831 --> 31:18.006
That's, like, my thing.

31:18.050 --> 31:21.009
But right now, I'm...
I'm worried about you.

31:21.053 --> 31:22.750
You know,

31:22.793 --> 31:24.839
yesterday, you could've run,

31:24.883 --> 31:26.623
but you decided
to stay with Ben.

31:26.667 --> 31:28.930
You tried to make a difference.
That's who you are.

31:28.974 --> 31:31.977
And I'm worried
about how you're gonna feel

31:32.020 --> 31:34.675
a month from now,
a year from now

31:34.718 --> 31:37.330
when you realize that you could
have made a difference today.

31:37.373 --> 31:38.984
I can't.

31:39.027 --> 31:41.987
I feel powerless, okay?
I don't know if you do, too.

31:42.030 --> 31:44.337
You were minding
your own business,

31:44.380 --> 31:46.078
and then, suddenly,

31:46.121 --> 31:48.036
everything fell apart
around you.

31:48.080 --> 31:50.473
That's not your fault.

31:50.517 --> 31:53.215
Well, I just want it to stop.

31:53.259 --> 31:55.261
We can't stop chaos.

31:56.958 --> 31:59.874
But... a friend of mine told me

31:59.918 --> 32:02.746
that we can, uh, at least
find some order in it.

32:04.574 --> 32:06.446
Now you can walk away.

32:06.489 --> 32:08.448
I'm not gonna stop you.

32:08.491 --> 32:10.841
Just know that right now,

32:10.885 --> 32:12.887
you're the only person

32:12.931 --> 32:15.977
who can restore some order
for the rest of us.

32:16.021 --> 32:19.328
And I know that I, for one...

32:19.372 --> 32:21.374
I'd really appreciate it.

32:27.728 --> 32:29.991
Okay.

32:30.035 --> 32:31.993
I'll do it.

32:32.037 --> 32:33.908
Yeah?

32:33.952 --> 32:36.258
Oh. Oh.

32:36.302 --> 32:38.957
Oh, that's amazing.
That's...

32:39.000 --> 32:40.393
Hey! Hey!

32:40.436 --> 32:42.003
You hear that? Yeah, I did.

32:42.047 --> 32:43.831
Oh, man, I feel giddy,
you know, like I could float.

32:43.874 --> 32:46.268
Might be the head injury. I think it is.

32:46.312 --> 32:49.010
Yeah, I feel real dizzy.
I need to sit.

32:49.054 --> 32:51.143
Sebastian. Sebastian?

32:51.186 --> 32:52.622
Help!

32:59.673 --> 33:01.457
Dr. Brown to Oncology.

33:01.501 --> 33:03.851
Dr. Brown to Oncology.

33:03.894 --> 33:06.027
I have no idea
what just happened.

33:06.071 --> 33:07.724
What happened is, you overdid it

33:07.768 --> 33:09.291
and nearly
cracked your head open.

33:09.335 --> 33:11.032
How long have I been out?

33:11.076 --> 33:12.251
Two hours.

33:13.904 --> 33:15.689
Neila.

33:15.732 --> 33:17.647
She, uh... she said
she was gonna help us.

33:17.691 --> 33:20.433
They're wrapping up the
operation now. It went well.

33:20.476 --> 33:22.261
She's gonna be fine.
You, on the other hand...

33:22.304 --> 33:23.827
what the hell were you thinking?

33:23.871 --> 33:25.046
I don't know.

33:25.090 --> 33:26.874
I just,
I wanted to work the case.

33:26.917 --> 33:29.050
And you did, Sebastian.

33:29.094 --> 33:31.879
We got the shrapnel.
Gonna have it analyzed.

33:31.922 --> 33:34.882
Yeah? Well, all right.
Help me up. Let's go to the lab.

33:34.925 --> 33:36.405
Uh... No.

33:36.449 --> 33:37.928
Yeah.

33:37.972 --> 33:39.278
You're not going anywhere.

33:39.321 --> 33:41.367
Doctor says you
have brain swelling.

33:41.410 --> 33:43.499
You need to rest. I can still work.

33:43.543 --> 33:44.979
I will kick your ass
and leave scars

33:45.023 --> 33:47.068
if you even try
to make a move out of the bed.

33:50.463 --> 33:52.726
I think I'm gonna stay.

33:52.769 --> 33:53.901
I think it's a good choice.

33:53.944 --> 33:57.122
You did good, Sebastian.

33:57.165 --> 33:58.949
But if you ever try
anything like that again...

33:58.993 --> 34:00.647
I know. She'll kill me.

34:00.690 --> 34:02.040
She'll have to wait in line.

34:04.172 --> 34:06.218
This is what
the surgeons removed

34:06.261 --> 34:08.655
from Neila Diseris...
a cell phone memory card.

34:08.697 --> 34:10.351
Is that a serial number?

34:10.396 --> 34:11.918
Partial, yes. Yeah, but
enough to trace

34:11.962 --> 34:14.530
where the phone
was purchased. And by who.

34:14.574 --> 34:16.010
Colton Wolf.

34:16.054 --> 34:17.838
Yeah, bought this phone

34:17.880 --> 34:20.754
and two others in a shop
last week in Houston.

34:20.797 --> 34:22.538
Now I dug
into his browsing history.

34:22.581 --> 34:26.063
He spent a lot of time on the
dark web looking for explosives.

34:26.107 --> 34:27.326
Which clearly he found.

34:27.369 --> 34:29.110
Yeah, Wolf's our bomb-maker,

34:29.154 --> 34:31.156
and he had Alan Van Scyoc
plant the first device,

34:31.199 --> 34:33.766
and then, he snuck in the
second device in our evidence.

34:33.810 --> 34:35.333
You know what
my next question's gonna be.

34:35.377 --> 34:36.900
Where is he? Yeah.
That's the problem.

34:36.944 --> 34:38.902
We tracked his
movements from Houston

34:38.946 --> 34:40.078
within the last few days.

34:40.121 --> 34:41.862
He checked into a hotel
outside of town.

34:41.905 --> 34:43.516
Oh, yeah,
he definitely was here.Yeah.

34:43.559 --> 34:45.909
But he's been off the grid since
the morning of the bombing.

34:45.953 --> 34:48.129
We need to find him. Yeah, I guess by now,
he knows we're looking.

34:48.172 --> 34:49.565
He could be anywhere.

34:49.609 --> 34:51.958
There is one person
that could help us...

34:52.002 --> 34:53.438
Alan Van Scyoc.

34:53.482 --> 34:55.092
Yeah, but our time is up.

34:55.136 --> 34:56.485
Van Scyoc is being
released from custody,

34:56.529 --> 34:58.226
and we don't have
enough to hold him.

34:58.270 --> 35:00.141
We may not be able
to arrest him again,

35:00.185 --> 35:02.448
but we may be able
to get him to cooperate.

35:02.491 --> 35:04.058
Yeah, but Wolf helped him
kill a woman

35:04.102 --> 35:05.886
who would probably put
his brother in prison forever.

35:05.929 --> 35:07.235
Why would he help us?

35:07.279 --> 35:09.933
Pride had an instinct
that he was in over his head.

35:09.977 --> 35:11.718
Brother or no brother,

35:11.761 --> 35:13.850
he may not want to live
with blood on his hands.

35:13.894 --> 35:15.809
Alan is at a hearing
for his release.

35:15.852 --> 35:17.898
I'll call Pride,
meet him at the courthouse.

35:24.731 --> 35:26.646
Alan Van Scyoc.

35:26.689 --> 35:28.952
I don't need to talk to you.
Judge says I'm free to go.

35:28.996 --> 35:31.303
You're right. You don't
have to say a word to us,

35:31.346 --> 35:32.956
but this isn't over.

35:33.000 --> 35:34.480
I'm not involved in this mess.

35:34.523 --> 35:35.742
You know that's not true.

35:35.785 --> 35:37.309
The judge said...

35:37.352 --> 35:38.745
We know what the judge said,

35:38.788 --> 35:40.790
and we're not here
to arrest you.

35:40.834 --> 35:43.358
We're here to get
your assistance.

35:43.402 --> 35:46.840
Three people are dead,
more injured, lives changed.

35:46.883 --> 35:48.842
All right, we know
you're involved.

35:48.885 --> 35:51.758
I didn't... But we don't believe
that you meant to be.

35:51.801 --> 35:54.761
We think your brother and
Colton Wolf forced you.

35:54.804 --> 35:56.589
If you're okay

35:56.632 --> 35:59.418
with the damage that's been
done, then you should leave.

35:59.461 --> 36:02.464
But if you're not,
you need to talk to us.

36:02.508 --> 36:05.337
This isn't going away, Alan.

36:05.380 --> 36:07.556
All right? You're gonna
feel the weight of this

36:07.600 --> 36:11.473
for the rest of your life unless
you do something about it.

36:12.822 --> 36:14.998
It wasn't supposed to be a bomb.

36:15.912 --> 36:18.567
It was supposed to be a warning.

36:18.611 --> 36:20.178
Just a dead fish wrapped
in Dr. Logan's deposition,

36:20.221 --> 36:21.875
just to back her off.

36:21.918 --> 36:24.921
Who told you that? Colton.

36:24.965 --> 36:27.010
I had no idea.
You have to believe me.

36:27.054 --> 36:28.708
We do believe you, Alan.

36:28.751 --> 36:30.971
Now you need to come back
to NCIS with us.

36:31.014 --> 36:32.929
We'll work this whole thing out.

36:32.973 --> 36:34.453
I just want to make this right.

36:50.251 --> 36:53.385
Everybody down!
Get off the street!

36:53.428 --> 36:55.256
Move! Move! Move!

36:55.300 --> 36:57.693
Special Agent Pride, NCIS.

36:57.737 --> 37:00.435
We got a shooting outside the
federal courthouse. One victim.

37:00.479 --> 37:03.438
All right, we need
backup and an ambulance.

37:03.482 --> 37:05.658
Suspect was on the balcony.
High-powered rifle.

37:05.701 --> 37:07.355
Did you get him? No. He's fleeing.

37:07.399 --> 37:09.444
Go after him, Christopher. Am I dying?

37:09.488 --> 37:11.533
No, no, no. You're gonna hang
on, Alan. You understand me?

37:11.577 --> 37:13.231
You're gonna hang on.
That's what's gonna happen here.

37:19.628 --> 37:20.847
Pride, it's Colton Wolf.

37:20.890 --> 37:22.457
He's heading northeast
on Chartres!

37:22.501 --> 37:25.286
One suspect,
armed and dangerous.

37:25.330 --> 37:27.680
He's fleeing. This man needs
medical attention!

37:27.723 --> 37:30.509
I'm on my way!

38:18.905 --> 38:21.081
Want to go first?

38:21.124 --> 38:22.474
After you, King.

38:29.872 --> 38:31.483
You good?

38:31.526 --> 38:32.875
Time of my life.

38:34.399 --> 38:36.923
Wolf! You're surrounded.
There's nowhere to go.

38:43.016 --> 38:44.626
It's over, Wolf.

38:49.196 --> 38:51.372
Get your hands up, Wolf!

38:51.416 --> 38:53.026
Nowhere to run!

38:55.420 --> 38:56.812
Don't do it!

39:18.660 --> 39:21.663
Alan Van Scyoc is gonna survive.

39:21.707 --> 39:25.145
And when he gets out
of the hospital, he'll testify

39:25.188 --> 39:28.931
that his brother colluded with
Colton Wolf to set both bombs.

39:28.975 --> 39:30.585
Big brother's going for life.

39:30.629 --> 39:32.935
Yeah, only wish Wolf would
have survived to do the same.

39:32.979 --> 39:34.415
He took the coward's way out.

39:34.459 --> 39:35.851
Yeah, well, thankfully,
we had some heroes

39:35.895 --> 39:37.636
help us out on this one.

39:37.679 --> 39:40.682
You know, Neila Diseris deserves
a commendation for what she did.

39:40.726 --> 39:42.858
Already spoke
to her C.O. about just that.

39:42.902 --> 39:44.469
Navy's lucky to have her.

39:44.512 --> 39:46.819
Not for nothing, but Sebastian...

39:46.862 --> 39:48.647
he deserves a commendation, too.

39:48.690 --> 39:51.824
I mean, he put his life on the
line for this one, literally.

39:51.867 --> 39:54.000
You know, I mentioned that to
him before he left the hospital.

39:54.043 --> 39:57.960
He said no. He said
he was just doing his job.

39:58.004 --> 39:59.875
Hmm. Sounds like something
you'd say, King.

39:59.919 --> 40:01.834
You know, Sebastian's turned

40:01.877 --> 40:04.184
into a pretty darn good
field agent, hasn't he?

40:04.227 --> 40:07.448
Yeah, he has. He is smart,
he's brave, he's strong.

40:07.492 --> 40:10.103
Real-life superhero.

40:11.452 --> 40:12.975
Aah! Aah!

40:13.019 --> 40:15.456
♪ Oh, why don't you call...

40:15.500 --> 40:18.067
What's wrong now, Sebastian?

40:18.111 --> 40:19.591
Soup is so hot!

40:19.634 --> 40:21.070
Did you cook it in a cauldron?

40:21.114 --> 40:23.421
Following the instructions
on the can.

40:23.464 --> 40:24.639
This is canned soup?

40:24.683 --> 40:27.076
♪ And now I got to fix you...

40:27.120 --> 40:28.904
Yeah, well,
I was trying to concentrate

40:28.948 --> 40:30.428
on your very specific
instructions

40:30.471 --> 40:32.299
for the grilled cheese sandwich.

40:32.342 --> 40:34.780
Yeah. About that... What's wrong with
the sandwich, Sebastian?

40:34.823 --> 40:37.478
Uh, nothing.
It's-it's fine.

40:38.827 --> 40:41.395
Just, supermarkets have
whole islands full

40:41.439 --> 40:43.484
of international cheeses,
and you went with American.

40:43.528 --> 40:44.964
Just kind of...

40:45.007 --> 40:48.228
It's simple comfort food,
Sebastian.

40:49.751 --> 40:51.536
Like from your childhood.

40:51.579 --> 40:53.407
Well, there was nothing
comforting about my childhood.

40:53.451 --> 40:54.800
If you're looking for sympathy,

40:54.843 --> 40:56.105
I'm already playing nurse maid.

40:56.149 --> 41:00.196
Aah.

41:00.240 --> 41:03.156
You did get pretty scared
when I passed out, though, huh?

41:03.199 --> 41:04.549
Of course I did.

41:04.592 --> 41:05.985
'Cause you love me?

41:06.028 --> 41:07.987
Of course I do, you idiot.

41:08.030 --> 41:12.600
Also, I can't afford
the mortgage if you die, so...

41:14.733 --> 41:16.517
I love you, too, Gregorio.

41:16.561 --> 41:18.606
You know why?

41:18.650 --> 41:20.956
Because I cooked for you?

41:21.000 --> 41:25.352
Definitely not. That's... No.

41:25.395 --> 41:28.355
'Cause you bring order
to my chaos.

41:28.398 --> 41:31.140
♪ I'm prayin'
to that sweet melody... ♪

41:31.184 --> 41:33.969
Cool.

41:34.013 --> 41:35.928
You're gonna eat that?

41:35.971 --> 41:37.538
Yeah. If I ever get feeling
back in my tongue...

41:37.582 --> 41:38.931
Put it in your mouth!

41:38.974 --> 41:42.108
Okay, all right.

41:42.151 --> 41:43.718
Okay, I'm eating.
Here we go.

41:45.590 --> 41:47.505
Mmm.
