With me, and he would always say

That he couldn't because he

05:21.722 --> 05:22.387

05:22.389 --> 05:23.055
Let me get out my camera.

05:23.057 --> 05:23.722
>> this is crazy.

05:23.724 --> 05:24.389
>> this is insane.

05:24.391 --> 05:25.424
>> and now she's requesting

05:25.426 --> 05:26.358
Our help with an

05:26.360 --> 05:27.592
Instagram relationship.

05:27.594 --> 05:28.794
>> listen, i totally believe in

05:28.796 --> 05:29.895
The universe, man.

05:29.897 --> 05:30.862
This is not a coincidence.

05:30.864 --> 05:31.630
>> wow.

05:31.632 --> 05:32.331
Okay, so we just

05:32.333 --> 05:33.332
Read your email.

05:33.334 --> 05:35.567
This guy has, like, a real

05:35.569 --> 05:37.536
Emotional hold on you.

05:37.538 --> 05:38.937
>> a huge one.

05:38.939 --> 05:40.372
It was like he knew the right

05:40.374 --> 05:42.307
Things to say at the right time.

05:42.309 --> 05:43.575
"oh, you're beautiful."

05:43.577 --> 05:44.910
The good morning text messages,

05:44.912 --> 05:45.644
The good night.

05:45.646 --> 05:46.678
He will often ask

05:46.680 --> 05:48.313
Is my daughter okay.

05:48.315 --> 05:49.648
He just made it aware that he

05:49.650 --> 05:53.018
Was there for me no matter what.

05:53.020 --> 05:54.353
>> has he ever, like, sent you

05:54.355 --> 05:55.654
Music that he produced?

05:55.656 --> 05:56.321
>> no.

05:56.323 --> 05:57.055
>> that's a little weird.

05:57.057 --> 05:57.823
If he is an up-and-coming...

05:57.825 --> 05:58.523
>> it is, but--

05:58.525 --> 05:59.191
>> music producer,

05:59.193 --> 06:00.359
You'd think he would want to

06:00.361 --> 06:01.360
Share some of that music

06:01.362 --> 06:02.394
With you.

06:02.396 --> 06:03.161
>> right.

06:03.163 --> 06:04.629
>> have you spoken on the phone?

06:04.631 --> 06:05.297
>> yes.

06:05.299 --> 06:06.531
Three times.

06:06.533 --> 06:08.500
He sounds like he's the person

06:08.502 --> 06:09.835
That i've been seeing

06:09.837 --> 06:10.569
Everywhere, you know, in

06:10.571 --> 06:12.304
Pictures and everything.

06:12.306 --> 06:14.773
Nothing too crazy, like he's a

06:14.775 --> 06:16.174
Woman or anything.

06:16.176 --> 06:18.310
>> here's a guy who "wants to be

06:18.312 --> 06:19.945
There for you," and yet can't

06:19.947 --> 06:21.780
Take you out for dinner.

06:21.782 --> 06:22.447
>> get dinner?

06:22.449 --> 06:23.715
He not trying to smash?

06:23.717 --> 06:26.518
You a cute girl, miracle.

06:26.520 --> 06:28.487
>> if you really think that

06:28.489 --> 06:29.788
Meeting this guy is something

06:29.790 --> 06:32.224
That can greatly affect your

06:32.226 --> 06:33.625
Life, i would like to try and

06:33.627 --> 06:34.526
Make that happen.

06:34.528 --> 06:35.694
>> miracle needs a miracle.

06:35.696 --> 06:37.162
>> absolutely.

06:37.164 --> 06:39.197

06:39.199 --> 06:41.133
Together and catch the next

06:41.135 --> 06:42.501
Flight to milwaukee.

06:42.503 --> 06:43.301
>> oh, my god, i can't wait to

06:47.808 --> 06:48.774
Of that, nev?

It's amazing how the universe

06:49.810 --> 06:50.942
Works, yo.

06:50.944 --> 06:52.144
>> yeah, you guys were meant to

06:52.146 --> 06:53.245

06:56.016 --> 06:57.249
>> this is the fun part.

06:57.251 --> 06:58.850
Here we go, nev!

06:58.852 --> 07:00.085
Crazy how somebody like miracle

07:00.087 --> 07:00.986
Can fall for this.

07:00.988 --> 07:02.187
She knows it's probably b.S.

07:02.189 --> 07:03.054
>> she kind of knows.

07:03.056 --> 07:04.923
>> but she just wants to know.

07:04.925 --> 07:06.024
Hope dealers, man.

07:06.026 --> 07:08.360
He's selling hope.

>> this is your travel swag?

07:09.563 --> 07:10.896
>> t-shirt from target.

07:10.898 --> 07:13.932

07:13.934 --> 07:14.599
I need to catch

07:14.601 --> 07:16.668
A big-ass catfish.

07:16.670 --> 07:17.369
I can't believe y'all

07:17.371 --> 07:18.036
Couldn't pay for a

07:18.038 --> 07:19.070
Straight-through flight.

07:19.072 --> 07:19.838
This catfish [bleep] is too

Real, man.

07:20.774 --> 07:22.674
Y'all keeping it way too real.

07:30.884 --> 07:32.951
Javonni is this amazing, loving

07:32.953 --> 07:35.720
Person, and we don't know if he

07:35.722 --> 07:37.722
Is the real deal or not.

07:37.724 --> 07:39.524
This girl's got a story.

07:39.526 --> 07:40.192
We got to make her feel

07:40.194 --> 07:40.992
Comfortable to tell us.

07:40.994 --> 07:41.660
>> do something

07:41.662 --> 07:42.327
That men never do,

07:42.329 --> 07:43.295
Actually listen to the female.

07:43.297 --> 07:43.962
>> that's right.

08:11.892 --> 08:13.692
Barbie can be president,

08:13.694 --> 08:15.093
Astronaut, doctor, then she

08:15.095 --> 08:15.861
Can too.

08:15.863 --> 08:16.728
>> i didn't know barbie was that

08:16.730 --> 08:18.430
Racially diverse.

08:18.432 --> 08:20.165

08:20.167 --> 08:21.266
I'd like to know a little bit

08:21.268 --> 08:22.734
More just sort of about you and

Your background.

08:24.071 --> 08:24.736
>> well, of course.

08:24.738 --> 08:25.837
I guess you should know why my

08:25.839 --> 08:27.005
Name is miracle.

08:27.007 --> 08:29.140
My mom, she was on drugs,

08:29.142 --> 08:30.375
And she didn't know that she

08:30.377 --> 08:32.043
Was pregnant until

08:32.044 --> 08:33.745
The day she had me.

08:33.746 --> 08:35.046
She thought she had a tumor.

08:35.048 --> 08:35.714
>> whoa.

08:35.716 --> 08:36.548
>> so...

08:36.549 --> 08:37.448
>> for nine months?

08:37.451 --> 08:38.250
>> mm-hmm.

08:38.251 --> 08:39.083
>> wow.

08:39.086 --> 08:39.751

Was your mom using primarily?

08:40.988 --> 08:41.653
>> crack cocaine.

08:41.655 --> 08:42.320
>> crack cocaine.

08:42.322 --> 08:42.988
>> me and my sisters,

08:42.990 --> 08:45.323
We were exchanges.

08:45.325 --> 08:45.991
>> what does that mean?

08:45.993 --> 08:46.658
>> yeah.

08:46.660 --> 08:47.325
>> she was on drugs.

08:47.327 --> 08:48.326
She didn't have the money.

08:48.328 --> 08:49.060
She had a vagina,

08:49.062 --> 08:50.295
They had, you know...

08:50.297 --> 08:52.397
So if i have sex with you,

08:52.399 --> 08:54.299
Can i have, you know...

08:54.301 --> 08:55.667
>> wow.

08:57.638 --> 08:58.403
>> where's he?

08:58.405 --> 08:59.704
>> i have no idea who he is.

08:59.706 --> 09:01.072
She doesn't even know, so...

09:01.074 --> 09:02.040
>> is she still struggling?

09:02.042 --> 09:03.074
>> mm-hmm.

09:03.076 --> 09:04.676
It's not as bad,

09:04.678 --> 09:06.244
But she's still on.

09:06.246 --> 09:07.045
She'll say, "no, i'm not."

09:07.047 --> 09:07.812
We know you are.

09:07.814 --> 09:10.348
We're not crazy.

09:10.350 --> 09:12.450
>> you have every reason

09:12.452 --> 09:13.418
To be a loser.

09:13.420 --> 09:14.085
>> right.

09:14.087 --> 09:14.786
>> like, you could have just

09:14.788 --> 09:15.654
Accepted it and been like, "you

09:15.656 --> 09:16.421
Know what, eff life.

09:16.423 --> 09:17.088
I'm gonna be a failure,

09:17.090 --> 09:17.822
Make excuses."

09:17.824 --> 09:19.291
>> i mean, i did at one point,

09:19.293 --> 09:20.692
But then i got pregnant.

09:20.694 --> 09:21.993
Then i had her and was like,

09:21.995 --> 09:23.128
"wow, okay, i have this little

09:23.130 --> 09:25.463
Person following me around now.

09:25.465 --> 09:26.131
You know, she's gonna

09:26.133 --> 09:26.798
Look up to me.

09:26.800 --> 09:28.366
Like, i'm somebody's mother."

09:28.368 --> 09:30.669
So she's the only reason.

09:30.671 --> 09:32.437
>> explain to me how javonni

09:32.439 --> 09:33.805
Got you wrapped up in

09:33.807 --> 09:35.340
This relationship.

09:35.342 --> 09:36.007
>> it may sound crazy.

09:36.009 --> 09:37.475
Like, the things he was saying,

09:37.477 --> 09:39.144
I hadn't heard in a while.

09:39.146 --> 09:40.278
>> then what happens?

09:40.280 --> 09:41.279
>> he just kind of, like,

09:41.281 --> 09:42.614
Dropped the random

09:42.616 --> 09:43.748
Bombshell on me.

09:43.750 --> 09:44.549
He was telling me

09:44.551 --> 09:45.550
That he had a meeting,

09:45.552 --> 09:46.885
A real big meeting in atlanta.

09:46.887 --> 09:47.786
He wanted me to be the first

09:47.788 --> 09:49.220
Person to know.

09:49.222 --> 09:50.422
He's saying, "t.I. Signed me to

09:50.424 --> 09:51.323
Grand hustle."

09:51.325 --> 09:53.091
He said, "i'm gonna have to move

09:53.093 --> 09:53.925
To atlanta."

09:53.927 --> 09:55.293
He was all over the place.

09:55.295 --> 09:56.261
He kept saying his sister had

09:56.263 --> 09:57.462
Lupus, so he was, like, back and

09:57.464 --> 10:00.298
Forth from there to here.

10:00.300 --> 10:02.100
Out of nowhere,

10:02.102 --> 10:03.735
I get a text message.

10:03.737 --> 10:04.736
"who is this?

10:04.738 --> 10:05.437
Don't text javonni's

10:05.439 --> 10:07.172
Phone anymore.

10:07.174 --> 10:08.673
He doesn't need you, you're a

10:08.675 --> 10:10.308
Groupie, you just want him for

10:10.310 --> 10:12.644
His money and who he is."

10:12.646 --> 10:14.713
>> he said, "oh, my god,

10:14.715 --> 10:18.383
That's my ex, she's crazy."

10:18.385 --> 10:20.185
>> do you think that all the

10:20.187 --> 10:21.052
Stuff that he was telling you

10:21.054 --> 10:22.320
May not be true?

10:22.322 --> 10:23.154
>> i mean, i know it's some sick

10:23.156 --> 10:24.589
People out here, but i don't

10:24.591 --> 10:25.390
Think that a person would lie

10:25.392 --> 10:27.425
About their sister having lupus.

10:27.427 --> 10:28.360
>> you don't watch <i> catfish.</i>

10:28.362 --> 10:29.361
>> i absolutely do.

10:29.363 --> 10:30.028
>> oh.

10:30.030 --> 10:30.795
>> i don't think he would lie

10:30.797 --> 10:31.463
About that, no.

10:31.465 --> 10:32.430
T.I., grand hustle?

10:32.432 --> 10:33.598
>> all right, well, i got to see

10:36.069 --> 10:36.735
>> all right, so let me

10:36.737 --> 10:37.602
Get this going.

10:37.604 --> 10:38.737
>> i'm watching nev in action.

10:38.739 --> 10:39.437
I feel like i'm watching

10:39.439 --> 10:40.905
Lebron play.

10:40.907 --> 10:42.007
>> that is javonni.

10:42.009 --> 10:43.041
>> okay.

10:43.043 --> 10:44.809
I have to say, he looks much

10:44.811 --> 10:46.344
More like a regular guy than i

10:46.346 --> 10:47.112
Thought he would.

10:47.114 --> 10:48.279
>> he looks attainable.

10:48.281 --> 10:50.415
>> i want to see your messages.

10:50.417 --> 10:51.082
>> his text messages?

10:51.084 --> 10:51.916
>> i would live to see this b.S.

10:51.918 --> 10:52.584
That he's feeding you.

10:52.586 --> 10:53.385
>> yeah, so let's just see what

10:53.387 --> 10:54.052
He says to you.

10:54.054 --> 10:54.719
>> you want to role play?

10:54.721 --> 10:55.587
Want me to be javonni?

10:55.589 --> 10:57.389
>> sure.

10:57.391 --> 10:58.890
>> "yeah, i'm that type of

10:58.892 --> 11:00.291
[bleep] when i find something

11:00.293 --> 11:01.192
I like."

11:01.194 --> 11:02.994
>> you found something you like?

11:02.996 --> 11:03.995
>> "i believe i have."

11:03.997 --> 11:05.263
>> i think i have.

11:05.265 --> 11:05.997
>> "really?

11:05.999 --> 11:07.332
That's what it dew"--

11:07.334 --> 11:08.500
D-e-w.

11:08.502 --> 11:10.168
>> i told my friends i think i'm

11:10.170 --> 11:11.469
Being catfished.

11:11.471 --> 11:12.303
>> "aw, yeah, that's

11:12.305 --> 11:13.405
Some bull[bleep].

11:13.407 --> 11:14.406
Laugh out loud.

11:14.408 --> 11:16.541
I need to be asking you that.

11:16.543 --> 11:18.576
Wait, are you a catfish?

11:18.578 --> 11:20.712
You seem to be everything i look

11:20.714 --> 11:22.447
For in a woman.

11:22.449 --> 11:23.448
I think i need a miracle

11:23.450 --> 11:24.482
In my life."

11:24.484 --> 11:25.917
This is amazing.

11:25.919 --> 11:26.918
He's good.

11:26.920 --> 11:27.919
Now i'm starting to see

11:27.921 --> 11:28.853
He's kind of good.

11:28.855 --> 11:30.455
>> he's giving me attention.

11:30.457 --> 11:31.589
I don't really feel like i've

11:31.591 --> 11:33.591
Met anyone worthy enough for me

11:33.593 --> 11:35.226
To say i'm ready to settle down.

11:35.228 --> 11:36.695
Javonni just makes me feel

11:36.697 --> 11:38.129
More wanted.

11:38.131 --> 11:39.164
At the end of the day,

11:39.166 --> 11:40.031
I feel like i deserve to be

11:40.033 --> 11:41.599
Happy just like everybody else.

11:41.601 --> 11:43.201
Like, my past should not

11:43.203 --> 11:45.136
Determine my future.

11:45.138 --> 11:46.471
I can honestly say everything

11:46.473 --> 11:48.106
That he's said about the grand

11:48.108 --> 11:49.574
Hustle, the producing,

11:49.576 --> 11:50.775
Everything, i don't really care

11:50.777 --> 11:51.643
About that stuff.

11:51.645 --> 11:52.877
He's a great guy.

11:52.879 --> 11:54.646
If it's not him,

11:54.648 --> 11:56.247
I just want to know why.

11:56.249 --> 11:58.116
>> it means being ready for

11:58.118 --> 11:59.818
The truth.

11:59.820 --> 12:02.053
>> i'm ready--it's long overdue.

12:02.055 --> 12:02.721
>> all right.

12:02.723 --> 12:03.488
We're gonna get out of here.

12:03.490 --> 12:04.355
Do some research.

12:04.357 --> 12:05.557
We'll be in touch.

12:05.559 --> 12:06.524
>> bye, charlamagne.

12:06.526 --> 12:08.326
>> all right, miracle.

12:08.328 --> 12:09.861
>> see you guys later.

12:09.863 --> 12:10.829
>> what do you think about all

12:10.831 --> 12:11.496
This, man?

12:11.498 --> 12:12.397
>> i ain't gonna front, man.

12:12.399 --> 12:13.598
It's a lot.

12:13.600 --> 12:14.866
Nobody ever paid her attention.

12:14.868 --> 12:15.667
She probably never felt like

12:15.669 --> 12:17.402
Somebody really cared.

12:17.404 --> 12:18.603
I want to hug my daughter and,

12:18.605 --> 12:20.705
Like, "oh, you are loved."

12:20.707 --> 12:22.373
This guy is not gonna be nothing

12:22.375 --> 12:23.041
That she thinks he's

12:23.043 --> 12:24.209
Going to be.

12:24.211 --> 12:26.277
Lord have mercy.

12:31.150 --> 12:32.851
>> so you do this at a cafe?

12:32.853 --> 12:33.651
>> that's all i need.

12:33.653 --> 12:34.719
>> you are the cheapest man

12:34.721 --> 12:35.553
In america.

12:35.555 --> 12:37.222
You stay in three-star hotels...

12:37.224 --> 12:38.056
>> free internet.

12:38.058 --> 12:38.723
>> you drive minivans,

12:38.725 --> 12:40.258
And you mooch people's

12:40.260 --> 12:42.694
Free wireless?

12:42.696 --> 12:43.428
>> so basically what we're

12:43.430 --> 12:44.095
Dealing with--

12:44.097 --> 12:44.963
We've got a young lady, she's

12:44.965 --> 12:46.564
26, nine-year-old daughter.

12:46.566 --> 12:47.699
Some guy hits her up on

12:47.701 --> 12:49.400
Instagram, gives miracle his

12:49.402 --> 12:50.935
Number, they start texting,

12:50.937 --> 12:52.370
And here we are a year later.

12:52.372 --> 12:53.271
We've got to figure out who this

12:53.273 --> 12:54.372
Javonni guy is,

12:54.374 --> 12:56.007
If he's the guy in the pictures.

12:56.009 --> 12:57.242
I mean, right now we really

12:57.244 --> 12:58.176
Don't know if anything he's

12:58.178 --> 12:59.611
Telling her is true.

12:59.613 --> 13:00.411
>> so what are we waiting on to

13:00.413 --> 13:01.646
Work your magic?

13:01.648 --> 13:02.313
This is all you use,

13:02.315 --> 13:03.181
Is a computer?

13:03.183 --> 13:04.048
You don't have, like, no,

13:04.050 --> 13:04.883
Like, no batman utility belt?

13:04.885 --> 13:07.552
>> we have no special tools.

13:07.554 --> 13:09.954
I got my phone and a laptop

13:09.956 --> 13:11.623
And free wi-fi.

13:11.625 --> 13:13.424
>> wow.

13:13.426 --> 13:14.592
>> let's start with javonni's

13:14.594 --> 13:15.426
Phone number.

13:15.428 --> 13:17.295
Let's throw it in spokeo.

13:17.297 --> 13:20.098
It's searching.

13:20.100 --> 13:22.167
Oh, we got male.

13:22.169 --> 13:23.568
It says address unknown.

13:23.570 --> 13:24.836
So not a lot coming through on

13:24.838 --> 13:26.738
The phone number, unfortunately.

13:26.740 --> 13:27.438
>> you're really looking

13:27.440 --> 13:28.640
For this guy.

13:28.642 --> 13:30.208
I really thought that this was

13:30.210 --> 13:31.576
Some type of plant, like--

13:31.578 --> 13:32.443
>> you thought somehow we

13:32.445 --> 13:33.711
Wouldn't have to actually figure

13:33.713 --> 13:34.712
It out and find him?

13:34.714 --> 13:35.847
>> yeah.

13:35.849 --> 13:36.514
I thought he was already

13:36.516 --> 13:37.182
In on the act.

13:37.184 --> 13:38.049
>> no, man.

13:38.051 --> 13:39.050
>> this is a real show.

13:39.052 --> 13:39.784
You're not doing this just

13:39.786 --> 13:40.685
'cause i'm here, right?

13:40.687 --> 13:41.686
>> nope.

13:41.688 --> 13:42.921
Let's go through his photos, and

13:42.923 --> 13:44.422
Then we'll do an image search.

13:44.424 --> 13:46.424
Here's the first one.

13:46.426 --> 13:48.860
No direct match.

13:48.862 --> 13:49.994
No hits.

13:49.996 --> 13:51.229
>> this guy doesn't exist, man.

13:51.231 --> 13:52.463
>> ahh!

13:52.465 --> 13:53.131
>> so what do you do

13:53.133 --> 13:54.332
When you strike out?

13:54.334 --> 13:54.999
>> you know what i think

13:55.001 --> 13:55.667
Could help?

13:55.669 --> 13:56.334
>> what?

13:56.336 --> 13:58.837
>> a little silver fox infusion.

13:58.839 --> 13:59.504
>> okay.

13:59.506 --> 14:00.672
>> i usually do this with max.

14:00.674 --> 14:01.573
>> so you're admitting right now

14:01.575 --> 14:02.574
That max is the brains of

14:02.576 --> 14:03.808
This operation, basically.

14:03.810 --> 14:04.475
>> i think max has

14:04.477 --> 14:05.510
A lot to offer.

14:05.512 --> 14:07.378
Let's give him a call.

14:07.380 --> 14:09.347
Oh, connecting.

14:09.349 --> 14:10.882
Hey!

14:10.884 --> 14:11.616
>> hey, guys.

14:11.618 --> 14:13.685
>> what's going on?

14:15.020 --> 14:15.687
>> really?

14:15.689 --> 14:16.821
That's a set, max?

14:16.823 --> 14:18.022
>> so while you're on the beach,

14:18.024 --> 14:18.857
I'm sitting here with

14:18.859 --> 14:20.291
Charlamagne trying to track down

14:20.293 --> 14:22.260
Javonni santos.

14:22.262 --> 14:22.927
Guess what--

14:22.929 --> 14:24.996
He's a music producer.

14:27.967 --> 14:29.467
>> [laughs]

14:29.469 --> 14:31.870
>> right.

14:31.872 --> 14:33.972
We need a little inspiration.

14:33.974 --> 14:35.206
What are, like, all those things

14:35.208 --> 14:37.275
That we always remember after--

14:38.777 --> 14:41.279
>> peoplesmart?

14:41.281 --> 14:43.414
>> let's write that down.

14:43.416 --> 14:44.315
>> hey, come on!

14:44.317 --> 14:45.383
I'm a little rusty.

14:45.385 --> 14:46.484

14:55.996 --> 14:58.062
Shows up on peoplesmart.

14:58.064 --> 14:59.297
Come on, now.

14:59.299 --> 15:00.531
Come on, give us something.

15:00.533 --> 15:01.566

15:01.568 --> 15:02.433

Need now to totally prove that

17:39.592 --> 17:41.526
She's not talking to this guy.

17:41.528 --> 17:43.327
The guy she is talking to is

17:43.329 --> 17:45.329
Potentially rickie.

17:45.331 --> 17:47.832
We should go over to miracle's,

17:47.834 --> 17:48.766
Show her everything that we

17:48.768 --> 17:50.168
Found, because we might say

17:50.170 --> 17:51.135
Rickie witherspoon to her and

17:51.137 --> 17:52.637
She might say, like,

17:52.639 --> 17:53.838

17:53.840 --> 17:54.505

How are you feeling right now?

18:11.591 --> 18:12.824
>> nervous.

18:12.826 --> 18:13.524
>> it's very important to

18:13.526 --> 18:14.492
Remember right now that you may

18:14.494 --> 18:16.094
Not control all the events that

18:16.096 --> 18:17.295
Happen to you, but you can

18:17.297 --> 18:18.362
Decide whether or not to be

18:18.364 --> 18:19.730
Reduced by them.

18:19.732 --> 18:20.965
>> thanks, charlamagne.

18:20.967 --> 18:22.834
>> first thing's first.

18:22.836 --> 18:24.068
We did a phone search,

18:24.070 --> 18:25.870
And that gave us a hit.

18:25.872 --> 18:27.205
It came up registered to a guy

18:27.207 --> 18:28.072
Named rickie.

18:28.074 --> 18:28.739
Do you have any idea

18:28.741 --> 18:29.407
Who that guy is?

18:29.409 --> 18:31.075
>> no, but his address--

18:31.077 --> 18:32.043
That's right down the street

18:32.045 --> 18:33.344
From where i live.

18:33.346 --> 18:34.011

18:35.415 --> 18:37.982
In walking distance.

18:37.984 --> 18:38.816

18:38.818 --> 18:41.152
Look up rickie witherspoon,"

18:41.154 --> 18:42.620
And it did bring us to

18:42.622 --> 18:44.689
This twitter account.

18:46.358 --> 18:49.093
This doesn't ring any bells?

18:49.095 --> 18:50.795
Well, we were scrolling through

18:50.797 --> 18:52.063
Tweets and we came across

18:52.065 --> 18:53.664
This video.

18:53.666 --> 18:54.832
>> you know who i am,

18:54.834 --> 18:55.900
The director.

18:55.902 --> 18:57.802
Mr. Director.

18:57.804 --> 18:59.303
Just finishing up, you know,

18:59.305 --> 19:00.805
Our little video shoot.

19:00.807 --> 19:03.407
>> having spoken to javonni on

19:03.409 --> 19:05.076
The phone,

19:05.078 --> 19:06.677
Does that guy's voice...

19:06.679 --> 19:07.678
>> no.

19:07.680 --> 19:08.346
>> sound anything like

19:08.348 --> 19:09.013
Javonni's to you?

19:09.015 --> 19:09.847
>> not at all.

19:09.849 --> 19:10.681
>> i don't think she wants it to

19:10.683 --> 19:12.984
Be his voice.

19:12.986 --> 19:15.119
>> so this morning, we decided,

19:15.121 --> 19:16.087
Let's do something we've never

19:16.089 --> 19:16.921
Done before.

19:16.923 --> 19:17.989
We downloaded a picture of

19:17.991 --> 19:19.524
Javonni and sort of asked

19:19.526 --> 19:20.858
The internet, "does anybody know

19:20.860 --> 19:22.226
Who this guy is?"

19:22.228 --> 19:24.195
And it brought us to an

19:24.197 --> 19:25.463
Instagram account.

19:25.465 --> 19:27.899
"eyeyouugly."

19:27.901 --> 19:29.233
The pictures are the same guy.

19:29.235 --> 19:30.201
We started to get to pictures

19:30.203 --> 19:32.470
That include this girl.

19:36.275 --> 19:38.509
>> yeah, that sucks.

19:38.511 --> 19:40.111
Bad.

19:40.113 --> 19:41.646
>> i believe that you're so real

19:41.648 --> 19:42.346
That it's easy for you to

19:42.348 --> 19:43.915
Believe in other people.

19:43.917 --> 19:44.715
That's why it was easy for you

19:44.717 --> 19:46.150
To believe that this guy was

19:46.152 --> 19:47.084
Javonni santos, or whatever

19:47.086 --> 19:48.519
His name was.

19:48.521 --> 19:49.420
>> like, someone should tell him

19:49.422 --> 19:51.222
That somebody's using him

19:51.224 --> 19:51.889
Like that.

19:51.891 --> 19:53.591
Like, that sucks.

19:53.593 --> 19:54.759
>> actually, we reached

19:54.761 --> 19:56.394
Out to him.

19:56.396 --> 19:58.296
I sent him an instagram message.

19:58.298 --> 19:59.096
I don't know if he wrote back,

19:59.098 --> 20:00.298
But we should check.

20:00.300 --> 20:01.699
Okay, he said, "sure, i'm free.

20:01.701 --> 20:03.167
We can facetime."

20:03.169 --> 20:04.669
So do you want to talk

20:04.671 --> 20:05.903
To this guy?

20:05.905 --> 20:07.972
>> yeah.

20:11.476 --> 20:12.443
>> hey, what's up?

20:12.445 --> 20:13.377

24:22.929 --> 24:24.995
There it is.

24:27.833 --> 24:29.500
I'll go knock,

24:29.502 --> 24:30.734
And i'll bring him out, okay?

24:30.736 --> 24:32.803
>> okay.

24:38.810 --> 24:39.677
>> i'm not sure which door

24:39.679 --> 24:41.745
To knock on.

24:44.082 --> 24:46.150
[knocking on door]

24:56.261 --> 24:57.795
>> oh, hell no.

24:57.797 --> 24:58.462
>> hey. How you doing?

24:58.464 --> 24:59.396
>> hey. How's it going?

24:59.398 --> 25:00.364
Pretty good.

25:00.366 --> 25:01.031
>> i'm nev.

25:01.033 --> 25:03.100
>> nice to meet you, nev.

25:05.670 --> 25:06.504
>> i'm gonna guess your

25:06.506 --> 25:08.572
Name is rickie...

25:09.875 --> 25:11.942
Aka javonni.

25:13.745 --> 25:14.478
>> this is a whole lot.

25:14.480 --> 25:15.145
It's a whole lot.

25:15.147 --> 25:15.813
>> right.

25:15.815 --> 25:16.480
>> but the best thing

25:16.482 --> 25:17.515
You could do is, you know,

25:17.517 --> 25:19.650
Follow me inside.

25:19.652 --> 25:22.152
>> actually what i'd like to do

25:22.154 --> 25:25.823
Is introduce you to miracle.

25:25.825 --> 25:26.624
>> yeah, i'll do that for you.

25:26.626 --> 25:27.291
>> so let's do that.

25:27.293 --> 25:29.360
>> i'll do that for you.

25:31.363 --> 25:32.596
I mean...

25:32.598 --> 25:33.297
>> you don't want to come

25:33.299 --> 25:34.164
Down here?

25:34.166 --> 25:35.900
>> i'd rather have her come up

25:35.902 --> 25:36.700
This way.

25:36.702 --> 25:37.768
>> why is that?

25:37.770 --> 25:38.602
>> like i said, you definitely

25:38.604 --> 25:39.637
Need to follow me inside.

25:39.639 --> 25:42.072
I got some...

25:42.074 --> 25:44.108
It's hard to explain right now.

25:44.110 --> 25:44.875
Yeah, it's hard to explain.

25:44.877 --> 25:45.709
>> why don't you just walk down

25:45.711 --> 25:46.377
Here with me?

25:46.379 --> 25:47.044
Wait, hold up, hold up.

25:47.046 --> 25:48.212
Hold up.

25:48.214 --> 25:49.480
Where are you going, man?

25:49.482 --> 25:50.681
>> nev, don't you follow no

25:50.683 --> 25:51.348
Angry black man into

25:51.350 --> 25:53.417
Their house.

25:54.486 --> 25:55.152
>> i guess he went

25:55.154 --> 25:57.788
Back upstairs.

25:57.790 --> 25:58.889
>> i can understand he feels

25:58.891 --> 26:00.457
Like we're putting him

26:00.459 --> 26:01.358
In the hot seat.

26:01.360 --> 26:03.427
He really needs us to go inside.

26:03.429 --> 26:04.628
I'm willing to go in.

26:04.630 --> 26:05.729
>> it's fine.

26:05.731 --> 26:06.430
Charlamagne, you have to

26:06.432 --> 26:07.131
Come too.

26:07.133 --> 26:08.999
>> oh, lord, mtv ain't paying me

26:09.001 --> 26:11.068
Enough for all of this, bro.

26:17.609 --> 26:20.177
>> okay, we are in the house.

26:20.179 --> 26:20.844
>> do you know me

26:20.846 --> 26:21.779
From somewhere?

26:21.781 --> 26:24.315
Like, have you seen me?

26:24.317 --> 26:25.649
>> no.

26:25.651 --> 26:27.718
>> so why me?

26:29.721 --> 26:31.455
>> you know, i...

26:31.457 --> 26:33.223
It's tough, man.

26:33.225 --> 26:35.292
It's hard.

26:37.362 --> 26:39.430
>> [sighs]

26:42.200 --> 26:42.866
>> hey.

26:42.868 --> 26:44.101
Let's just talk for a second.

26:44.103 --> 26:45.002
She's just feeling a lot of

26:45.004 --> 26:47.071
Anger and humiliation.

26:47.073 --> 26:47.771
>> i get that.

26:47.773 --> 26:48.439
I get that.

26:48.441 --> 26:50.174
>> so i think the best thing you

26:50.176 --> 26:51.675
Can do is to just tell her and

26:51.677 --> 26:54.244
Us what's going on with you.

26:54.246 --> 26:56.313
Whatever it is.

26:58.550 --> 27:01.251
>> oh, god.

27:01.253 --> 27:01.952
>> give me a sec.

27:01.954 --> 27:02.920
>> think about it.

27:02.922 --> 27:04.989
No pressure.

27:06.992 --> 27:08.926
He's just gonna take a second.

27:08.928 --> 27:09.593
I'd like to at least

27:09.595 --> 27:10.527
Give him an opportunity

27:10.529 --> 27:12.696
To just explain himself.

27:22.407 --> 27:24.975
>> oh, my god.

27:37.022 --> 27:37.688
>> all right.

27:37.690 --> 27:38.455
>> hi.

27:38.457 --> 27:39.123
>> hello. How are you?

27:39.125 --> 27:39.823
>> hi.

27:39.825 --> 27:40.891
>> i'm nev.

27:40.893 --> 27:41.659
>> i'm kara.

27:41.661 --> 27:42.326
>> kara.

27:42.328 --> 27:42.993
>> yes.

27:42.995 --> 27:43.961
>> hi.

27:43.963 --> 27:46.030
>> well...

27:49.200 --> 27:51.969
I'm javonni.

27:51.971 --> 27:54.338
>> meaning you are the person

27:54.340 --> 27:56.206
With whom miracle has

27:56.208 --> 27:57.641
Been texting?

27:57.643 --> 27:59.076
>> yes.

27:59.078 --> 28:00.611
>> which would mean that you're

28:00.613 --> 28:02.846
The guy on the phone

28:02.848 --> 28:03.914
That she spoke to?

28:03.916 --> 28:04.715
>> yes.

28:04.717 --> 28:05.449
>> so together,

28:05.451 --> 28:07.418
You guys created this--

28:07.420 --> 28:08.085
>> not together.

28:08.087 --> 28:08.752
>> no.

28:08.754 --> 28:10.688
>> i did it on my own.

28:10.690 --> 28:12.156
When miracle wanted to speak

28:12.158 --> 28:14.158
With a guy, i didn't know

28:14.160 --> 28:17.361
Who else to turn to...

28:17.363 --> 28:19.930
But my husband.

28:19.932 --> 28:21.065
I made a page, 'cause a friend

28:21.067 --> 28:23.934
Of mine, her boyfriend was

28:23.936 --> 28:25.836
Cheating on her, and the girl

28:25.838 --> 28:27.438
That he was cheating with, i was

28:27.440 --> 28:29.807
Trying to get her to give me all

28:29.809 --> 28:30.908
Of her information.

28:30.910 --> 28:31.842
So of course, when i made the

28:31.844 --> 28:33.077
Page, i'm just sending out

28:33.079 --> 28:35.479
Friend requests to everyone.

28:35.481 --> 28:37.181
>> so you made the javonni

28:37.183 --> 28:39.349
Santos page to reach out to a

28:39.351 --> 28:41.485
Girl that your friend's

28:41.487 --> 28:43.087
Boyfriend was messing

28:43.089 --> 28:43.754
Around with?

28:43.756 --> 28:45.055
>> yes.

28:45.057 --> 28:46.223
>> explain how we ended up here

28:46.225 --> 28:47.324
Right now.

28:47.326 --> 28:48.459
'cause there's a big--

28:48.461 --> 28:49.460
>> there is a big gap.

28:49.462 --> 28:52.429
Well, i don't work, because i

28:52.431 --> 28:54.098
Have lupus.

28:54.100 --> 28:55.199
Most of the time, i'm just kind

28:55.201 --> 28:56.500
Of laying around,

28:56.502 --> 28:57.701
Kind of in bed not feeling good,

28:57.703 --> 28:59.603
So when she started texting, it

28:59.605 --> 29:01.972
Was like, "oh," not thinking

29:01.974 --> 29:02.940
That it would have went

29:02.942 --> 29:03.607
This far.

29:03.609 --> 29:04.475
Not even thinking that it would

29:04.477 --> 29:05.909
Have lasted more than

29:05.911 --> 29:07.978
A week or two.

29:10.081 --> 29:10.748
>> this is some real

29:10.750 --> 29:11.982
<i>Catfish</i> [bleep].

29:11.984 --> 29:12.750
>> how do you let your wife do

29:12.752 --> 29:13.417
This, though?

29:13.419 --> 29:14.084
Why didn't you check

29:14.086 --> 29:14.752
Your wife, bro?

29:14.754 --> 29:15.619
>> like, why didn't you take the

29:15.621 --> 29:16.687
Phone and say, "miracle, it's my

29:16.689 --> 29:17.654
Wife, she playin'"?

29:17.656 --> 29:18.322
>> she's here majority

29:18.324 --> 29:19.356
Of the time.

29:19.358 --> 29:20.023
I'm usually not here.

29:20.025 --> 29:20.691
I'm working.

29:20.693 --> 29:21.692
That's what i do, you know?

29:21.694 --> 29:22.760
So i'm normally gone,

29:22.762 --> 29:24.128
So i didn't realize how deep it

29:24.130 --> 29:25.229
Had gotten.

29:25.231 --> 29:25.996
Like, girl, you need

29:25.998 --> 29:26.663
To stop with that.

29:26.665 --> 29:28.532
I didn't realize that it went

29:28.534 --> 29:30.400
Over what she originally planned

29:30.402 --> 29:33.103
For it to be.

29:33.105 --> 29:36.673
>> once i get to know miracle,

29:36.675 --> 29:37.541
Like, i thought she was a really

29:37.543 --> 29:40.010
Sweet girl.

29:40.012 --> 29:41.612
>> are your feelings--

29:41.614 --> 29:42.813
>> genuine. They're genuine.

29:42.815 --> 29:43.480
Yes.

29:43.482 --> 29:44.615
Everything through our text

29:44.617 --> 29:46.283
Messages, that was all me.

29:46.285 --> 29:47.284
>> but to be clear, you

29:47.286 --> 29:48.418
Expressed, at least from the

29:48.420 --> 29:49.820
Little bit that was made

29:49.822 --> 29:51.588
Apparent to us, like,

29:51.590 --> 29:53.657
Romantic feelings.

29:58.096 --> 30:00.597
>> um, some of it was pretend

30:00.599 --> 30:02.766
And some of it was real.

30:05.603 --> 30:06.670
But far as, like, wanting a

30:06.672 --> 30:08.539
Relationship with her, no, i

30:08.541 --> 30:10.174
Don't want to take it that far.

30:10.176 --> 30:11.341
>> i mean, just from what i got,

30:11.343 --> 30:12.743
It was a relationship.

30:12.745 --> 30:14.211
>> no, it wasn't.

30:14.213 --> 30:16.180
>> that, you know, couldn't be

30:16.182 --> 30:17.080
Put to rest, you know?

30:17.082 --> 30:18.916
Like, you know, a month goes

30:18.918 --> 30:20.784
Past, you're still conversating?

30:20.786 --> 30:21.451
Why are you still--

30:21.453 --> 30:22.119
You're still--

30:22.121 --> 30:24.721
This is what's still going on?

30:24.723 --> 30:26.557
>> this is some b.S. Right now.

30:26.559 --> 30:27.624
You did make me feel like that

30:27.626 --> 30:29.593
Person was a real person.

30:29.595 --> 30:31.228
Now we're on national television

30:31.230 --> 30:32.496
Looking crazy as hell.

30:32.498 --> 30:33.897
I got friends, i got family,

30:33.899 --> 30:35.199
I have a daughter.

30:35.201 --> 30:36.834
I have a job, i have a career,

30:36.836 --> 30:38.769
I work for the damn state.

30:38.771 --> 30:39.603
I'm sitting over here looking

30:39.605 --> 30:42.306
Dumb as hell because of you.

30:42.308 --> 30:43.440
>> i do apologize that you got

30:43.442 --> 30:44.508
Wrapped up, but at the same

30:44.510 --> 30:46.376
Time, it's not like, "you, you,

30:46.378 --> 30:47.377
You, you, you."

30:47.379 --> 30:48.178
It's not that.

30:48.180 --> 30:48.912
It's us.

30:48.914 --> 30:50.013
We did it together.

30:50.015 --> 30:50.814
We was in this together.

30:50.816 --> 30:52.883
We was--i wasn't texting myself.

30:53.818 --> 30:54.484
You're trying to blame

30:54.486 --> 30:55.419
The victim.

30:55.421 --> 30:56.553
>> mind you, several times,

30:56.555 --> 30:59.623
I did try to stop.

30:59.625 --> 31:01.692
>> every time you tried, you

31:01.694 --> 31:04.027
Were right back trying to keep

31:04.029 --> 31:05.128
Me to stay there, saying all of

31:05.130 --> 31:07.197
This weird stuff.

31:09.200 --> 31:09.867
Let's just be real.

31:09.869 --> 31:11.268
Do not sit there and say, like,

31:11.270 --> 31:12.502
You was just sitting here like,

31:12.504 --> 31:13.537
"i'm done, i'm done, i'm done,"

31:13.539 --> 31:14.404
And i'm just sitting there like

31:14.406 --> 31:16.073
Some dumb-ass female, and i'm

31:16.075 --> 31:17.174
Still there.

31:17.176 --> 31:18.842
>> come on, man, let's be real

31:18.844 --> 31:20.043
About the [bleep] thing.

31:20.045 --> 31:22.112
>> i tried more than once.

31:22.114 --> 31:23.747
>> is it lupus or is she psycho?

31:23.749 --> 31:25.749
Which one?

31:25.751 --> 31:27.284
You're a sick individual.

31:27.286 --> 31:28.285
>> i am a [bleep]

31:28.287 --> 31:29.219
Sick individual,

31:29.221 --> 31:29.887
I am a sick individual.

31:29.889 --> 31:30.554
>> i know you are.

31:30.556 --> 31:31.889
>> i have lupus, and i live with

31:31.891 --> 31:33.557
It every [bleep] day.

31:33.559 --> 31:34.224
>> your mind, your mind.

31:34.226 --> 31:35.092
>> you're talking about sick--

31:35.094 --> 31:35.759
My mind is good,

31:35.761 --> 31:36.426
My mind is good.

31:36.428 --> 31:37.294
>> something's wrong with you.

31:37.296 --> 31:39.596
[both speaking at once]

31:39.598 --> 31:40.264
>> i apologize.

31:40.266 --> 31:40.931
I said i'm sorry,

31:40.933 --> 31:41.832
And now what the [bleep]

31:41.834 --> 31:42.900
Do you want me to do?

31:42.902 --> 31:44.101
Like, get on my knees and beg?

31:44.103 --> 31:45.102
I'm not gonna do that.

31:45.104 --> 31:45.869
>> ladies, ladies, ladies.

31:45.871 --> 31:46.703
>> calm down, okay? Calm down.

31:46.705 --> 31:48.005
>> i'm beyond pissed.

31:48.007 --> 31:48.672
>> we ain't talking.

31:48.674 --> 31:49.640
I ain't talking to her no more.

31:49.642 --> 31:50.974
We ain't talking.

31:50.976 --> 31:51.842
>> maybe now is the appropriate

31:51.844 --> 31:52.509
Time to--

31:52.511 --> 31:53.510
>> absolutely.

31:53.512 --> 31:54.177
>> you see me?

31:54.179 --> 31:54.978
Don't speak me.

31:54.980 --> 31:55.712
>> trust me, there ain't no

31:55.714 --> 31:56.380
Reason to.

31:56.382 --> 31:58.215
Sweetie, you basic.

31:58.217 --> 31:58.882
>> do you see

31:58.884 --> 31:59.549
Your outfit, though?

31:59.551 --> 32:00.217
And i'm basic?

32:00.219 --> 32:00.884
Is that a fishnet?

32:00.886 --> 32:01.618
>> let's go. Let's go.

32:01.620 --> 32:02.286
>> there's the door.

32:02.288 --> 32:02.953
>> we can leave.

32:02.955 --> 32:03.787
'cause this [bleep]'s done.

32:03.789 --> 32:04.554
>> okay.

32:04.556 --> 32:05.289
>> all right, bro.

32:05.291 --> 32:06.089
Peace, man.

32:06.091 --> 32:06.924
>> take it easy.

32:06.926 --> 32:07.691
>> have a good day.

32:07.693 --> 32:08.625
>> you too, now.

32:08.627 --> 32:09.293
>> they's some

32:09.295 --> 32:10.227
Sick-ass individuals.

32:10.229 --> 32:11.328
They both some [bleep] bums

32:11.330 --> 32:12.996
If you ask me.

32:12.998 --> 32:13.764
>> you should holler at your

32:13.766 --> 32:14.431
Wife, though, man.

32:14.433 --> 32:15.098
Don't let her do that

32:15.100 --> 32:15.766
Again to somebody.

32:15.768 --> 32:16.600
>> you know, the bottom line is

32:16.602 --> 32:17.501
You don't know what's, you know,

32:17.503 --> 32:18.235
What's going on behind the

32:18.237 --> 32:18.902
Scenes, is basically

32:18.904 --> 32:19.569
What i'm trying to say.

32:19.571 --> 32:20.704
>> y'all be cool, man.

32:20.706 --> 32:23.006
>> get me the hell out of here.

32:24.642 --> 32:25.309
>> it is.

32:25.311 --> 32:26.310
>> that's it. It's over with.

32:26.312 --> 32:27.110
>> it is.

32:27.112 --> 32:29.179
>> you know?

32:34.052 --> 32:34.718
>> she didn't have to

32:34.720 --> 32:35.419
Call you basic.

32:35.421 --> 32:36.787
>> she own a fishnet top.

32:36.789 --> 32:37.754
I'm basic?

32:37.756 --> 32:39.289
Her haircut's $6.99.

32:39.291 --> 32:40.590
>> i'm telling you, a pack.

32:40.592 --> 32:41.258
>> it was on sale.

32:41.260 --> 32:42.326
Buy one, get one free.

32:42.328 --> 32:43.527
>> but you basic, though.

32:43.529 --> 32:46.029
>> i'm basic.

32:46.031 --> 32:47.431
>> i never would have considered

32:47.433 --> 32:49.032
That a woman who was catfishing

32:49.034 --> 32:49.700
You would have her

32:49.702 --> 32:51.935
Husband involved.

32:51.937 --> 32:54.004
>> oh, my goodness.

33:02.947 --> 33:03.680
[knocking on door]

33:03.682 --> 33:04.982
>> yo.

33:04.984 --> 33:05.649
>> hey, man.

33:05.651 --> 33:06.984
>> 'sup, bro?

33:06.986 --> 33:08.385
>> i think there's a lot more to

33:08.387 --> 33:09.419
Kara's story than

33:09.421 --> 33:10.654
We got yesterday.

33:10.656 --> 33:11.688
I just don't want to leave

33:11.690 --> 33:13.523
Tension and negativity.

33:13.525 --> 33:14.725
>> make miracle understand

33:14.727 --> 33:15.525
Kara better.

33:15.527 --> 33:16.193
You're a good guy, man.

33:16.195 --> 33:17.227
You got a great heart.

33:17.229 --> 33:19.096
>> i think my best chance at

33:19.098 --> 33:20.430
Sort of breaking down kara

33:20.432 --> 33:22.632
And getting her to really open

33:22.634 --> 33:23.667
Up to me would be to just talk

33:23.669 --> 33:25.802
To her solo,

33:25.804 --> 33:27.738
And then meet back up with you

33:27.740 --> 33:29.906
And miracle, fill you guys in,

33:29.908 --> 33:31.208
So that she can sit down with

33:31.210 --> 33:32.509
Kara and they can relate

33:32.511 --> 33:33.243
To each other.

33:33.245 --> 33:33.910
>> hi.

33:33.912 --> 33:34.578
>> hello.

33:34.580 --> 33:35.345
>> how you doing?

33:35.347 --> 33:36.513
>> how are you? I'm good.

33:36.515 --> 33:37.781
>> good to see you.

33:37.783 --> 33:39.182
I'd love to know what you

33:39.184 --> 33:40.250
Thought was gonna happen

33:40.252 --> 33:41.151
Yesterday when you walked out

33:41.153 --> 33:44.454
From that hallway, 'cause you

33:44.456 --> 33:46.056
Caught us all pretty off-guard.

33:46.058 --> 33:47.190
>> when i came out,

33:47.192 --> 33:48.225
I was so calm,

33:48.227 --> 33:49.893
And then, when i got upset

33:49.895 --> 33:51.261
Is she said, "it must be the

33:51.263 --> 33:52.796
Lupus that's messing with your

33:52.798 --> 33:53.764
Mind, that's making you

33:53.766 --> 33:55.032
Act psycho."

33:55.034 --> 33:55.699
You don't know what

33:55.701 --> 33:56.366
I've been through.

33:56.368 --> 33:57.501
You don't know what life is like

33:57.503 --> 33:59.403
When i'm stuck in my bed,

33:59.405 --> 34:00.470
That my husband has to carry me

34:00.472 --> 34:02.372
To the bathroom, help me take

34:02.374 --> 34:03.573
Down my clothes, sit me on the

34:03.575 --> 34:05.275
Toilet, help me wipe, put me

34:05.277 --> 34:06.143
Back in the bed.

34:06.145 --> 34:07.944
Like, you don't know that life.

34:07.946 --> 34:10.147
Lupus is an autoimmune disorder,

34:10.149 --> 34:12.382
And it affects everything.

34:12.384 --> 34:13.382
So there's no sun,

34:13.385 --> 34:14.985
No sun exposure.

34:14.987 --> 34:15.886
I have to wait until the sun

34:15.888 --> 34:16.887
Goes down before i can

34:16.889 --> 34:17.920
Go outside.

34:17.922 --> 34:18.588
>> really?

34:18.590 --> 34:19.922
>> i feel bad for my children,

34:19.925 --> 34:21.391
Because they want to go out and

34:21.393 --> 34:22.225
They want to play, they want to

34:22.226 --> 34:24.226
Enjoy things, but i'm not

34:24.228 --> 34:25.795
Able to.

34:25.797 --> 34:26.596
Sometimes, like, i feel like

34:26.598 --> 34:28.364
I'm suffocating.

34:28.367 --> 34:29.533
>> the situation you're in now

34:29.534 --> 34:31.333
Leaves you with a lot of indoor

34:31.335 --> 34:33.637
Time on your hands.

34:33.639 --> 34:35.639
Obviously, you fill some of that

34:35.641 --> 34:37.674
Time with social media.

34:37.676 --> 34:39.208
>> yes. Yes.

34:39.210 --> 34:40.944
>> you were using the instagram

34:40.946 --> 34:43.513
Profile to follow and learn

34:43.514 --> 34:44.681
About this other girl.

34:44.683 --> 34:46.116
>> right. Right.

34:46.118 --> 34:47.984
>> in an effort to make it seem

34:47.985 --> 34:49.286
Legit, you friended a bunch

34:49.288 --> 34:49.953
Of people.

34:49.955 --> 34:51.621
>> just random people.

34:51.623 --> 34:52.822
And she was the only one

34:52.824 --> 34:54.690
That responded.

34:54.693 --> 34:55.792
I said, "i'll just go with it

34:55.793 --> 34:56.726
For a little while."

34:56.728 --> 34:58.195
It was a relationship.

34:58.197 --> 34:59.229
I actually had some

34:59.231 --> 35:00.397
Kind of bond with her,

35:00.399 --> 35:01.665
Some kind of attachment.

35:01.667 --> 35:04.067
>> you were enjoying the

35:04.069 --> 35:06.069
Exchange of, sort of,

35:06.071 --> 35:08.138
Flirtation and attraction.

35:10.108 --> 35:11.308
>> i was kind of curious,

35:11.310 --> 35:13.210
Far as women.

35:13.212 --> 35:16.213
But growing up, it was nothing

35:16.215 --> 35:17.080
Ever that, you know, 'cause--

35:17.082 --> 35:19.549
My parents became pastors.

35:19.551 --> 35:20.317
If you do that, you're going

35:20.319 --> 35:21.218
Straight to hell.

35:21.220 --> 35:21.885
Hell is not a place

35:21.887 --> 35:23.086
That i want to go.

35:23.088 --> 35:24.521
I just never really

35:24.523 --> 35:25.989
Experimented with it.

35:25.991 --> 35:27.691
>> ♪ how can this happen ♪

35:27.693 --> 35:29.893
♪ how can this be ♪

35:29.895 --> 35:32.229
>> i'm telling her things

35:32.231 --> 35:33.697
That i would love to hear.

35:33.699 --> 35:35.132
>> ♪ there is no ending ♪

35:35.134 --> 35:37.767
♪ there is no peace ♪

35:37.769 --> 35:38.735
>> you wish someone would say

35:38.737 --> 35:40.971
Those things to you?

35:40.973 --> 35:43.340
>> more.

35:43.342 --> 35:44.241
You know, the lupus kind of

35:44.243 --> 35:48.145
Changed our marriage.

35:48.147 --> 35:49.646
He has to work,

35:49.648 --> 35:50.914
6:30 till 10:00,

35:50.916 --> 35:51.882
Every day.

35:51.884 --> 35:52.549
>> wow.

35:52.551 --> 35:54.084
>> and so we don't get that time

35:54.086 --> 35:56.052
That i want, you know, with him.

35:56.054 --> 35:58.155
But this is my life, so i have

35:58.157 --> 36:00.290
To accept it and i have to

36:00.292 --> 36:02.893
Live it.

36:02.895 --> 36:05.262
>> still a lot that needs to be

36:05.264 --> 36:07.264
Said and understood, but i feel

36:07.266 --> 36:08.632
Like if you guys could sit down

36:08.634 --> 36:10.167
And hear each other,

36:10.169 --> 36:11.768
There might be a chance

36:11.770 --> 36:13.837
At an actual friendship.

36:21.212 --> 36:22.412
>> this episode of <i> catfish: The</i>

36:22.414 --> 36:24.481
<i>Tv show</i> continues now.

36:27.985 --> 36:31.221
Kara really sees that she made a

36:31.223 --> 36:32.222
Bad decision,

36:32.224 --> 36:33.790
But she's lonely,

36:33.792 --> 36:35.625
And she is home all day long,

36:35.627 --> 36:36.660
And i think this is where maybe

36:36.662 --> 36:38.295
You guys can relate.

36:38.297 --> 36:40.030
She talked to you in the way

36:40.032 --> 36:41.298
That she wished someone would

36:41.300 --> 36:42.165
Talk to her.

36:42.167 --> 36:43.266
>> wow.

36:43.268 --> 36:44.701
That's deep.

36:44.703 --> 36:46.469
Use this opportunity to teach.

36:46.471 --> 36:47.537
Share your strength, man.

36:47.539 --> 36:48.638
You know she's dead wrong.

36:48.640 --> 36:49.739
She knows she's dead wrong.

36:49.741 --> 36:50.941
>> there is a real conversation

36:50.943 --> 36:51.775
That you could have that could

36:51.777 --> 36:53.910
Be pretty beneficial.

36:53.912 --> 36:55.212
Give her a chance.

36:55.214 --> 36:57.280
>> okay.

37:01.619 --> 37:02.285
With everything

37:02.287 --> 37:03.853
That happened yesterday,

37:03.855 --> 37:06.156
I was on ten,

37:06.158 --> 37:07.691
Ready to go.

37:07.693 --> 37:11.261
To know that he isn't real,

37:11.263 --> 37:13.797
I do kind of feel like a big

37:13.799 --> 37:15.332
Piece of me is gone.

37:15.334 --> 37:17.567
He was real to me.

37:17.569 --> 37:18.468
And i'm not gonna lie, i did

37:18.470 --> 37:20.537
Want to come in here today

37:20.539 --> 37:21.805
Being real negative.

37:21.807 --> 37:22.472
But i said,

37:22.474 --> 37:24.241
"okay, you know what? No.

37:24.243 --> 37:25.175
I'ma give her a chance to say

37:25.177 --> 37:26.977
Whatever it is she has to say."

37:26.979 --> 37:28.745
>> i apologize for

37:28.747 --> 37:29.813
Leading you on.

37:29.815 --> 37:32.349
My main thing is, i did not have

37:32.351 --> 37:34.517
Malicious intent to come in and

37:34.519 --> 37:36.519
Try to hurt you in any kind

37:36.521 --> 37:37.187
Of way.

37:37.189 --> 37:37.954
That's not even me.

37:37.956 --> 37:38.655
That's not even the type

37:38.657 --> 37:39.990
Of person that i am.

37:39.992 --> 37:41.224
It was something different

37:41.226 --> 37:42.025
About you.

37:42.027 --> 37:43.193
It was some kind of sincerity.

37:43.195 --> 37:43.860
It was just something

37:43.862 --> 37:44.761
Different about you,

37:44.763 --> 37:45.996
And it was weird, because, like,

37:45.998 --> 37:47.497
I would be laying in bed on the

37:47.499 --> 37:48.231
Side of my husband, and i'm

37:48.233 --> 37:49.766
Like, "i didn't get a good

37:49.768 --> 37:52.135
Morning text this morning."

37:52.137 --> 37:53.536
I honestly, truly thought this

37:53.538 --> 37:56.039
Person genuinely cares about me.

37:56.041 --> 37:58.308
I don't have many friends.

37:58.310 --> 37:59.075
You know, when i made the

37:59.077 --> 38:01.911
Javonni page, it was just like--

38:01.913 --> 38:03.380
Javonni was just kara.

38:03.382 --> 38:05.448
Just with a different face.

38:08.619 --> 38:11.421
>> even though you started it,

38:11.423 --> 38:13.356
I'm definitely not gonna put all

38:13.358 --> 38:14.224
The blame on you.

38:14.226 --> 38:15.692
It may sound crazy, but

38:15.694 --> 38:17.627
The text messages we shared--

38:17.629 --> 38:18.628
It meant a lot.

38:18.630 --> 38:20.463
Things that i shared with you,

38:20.465 --> 38:21.965
I told javonni before i told

38:21.967 --> 38:22.966
My friends.

38:22.968 --> 38:23.900
>> what i want you to know is,

38:23.902 --> 38:26.369
Like, all of that, the feelings,

38:26.371 --> 38:28.438
Like, that was kara.

38:28.440 --> 38:29.973
>> knowing the severity now of

38:29.975 --> 38:31.641

"hey, kara, you okay?

38:34.212 --> 38:35.245
How's it going?"

38:35.247 --> 38:37.414
Maybe one day becoming friends.

38:37.416 --> 38:38.581

38:38.583 --> 38:40.317
Felt like you and i did have

38:40.319 --> 38:42.185
Some kind of bond.

38:42.187 --> 38:42.852

39:07.112 --> 39:08.445

39:08.447 --> 39:09.813
As the conversation went on,

39:09.815 --> 39:11.114
Like, we both just started

39:11.116 --> 39:14.584
Sharing things and...

39:14.586 --> 39:17.153
The frowns turned into smiles.

39:17.155 --> 39:18.121
>> you learned something from

39:18.123 --> 39:19.089
Her, and i'm sure she learned a

39:19.091 --> 39:21.157

39:34.072 --> 39:36.806
Not having javonni to talk to.

39:44.582 --> 39:47.050
I tried to reach out to kara

39:47.052 --> 39:48.184
On facebook.

39:48.186 --> 39:50.920
