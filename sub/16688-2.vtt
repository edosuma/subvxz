WEBVTT

00:18.960 --> 00:20.960
Quick, get inside!

00:25.080 --> 00:27.080
Hurry!

00:29.440 --> 00:31.700
Do you think
they saw us?
Shh!

00:31.800 --> 00:32.900
( Knock on door )

00:33.000 --> 00:34.980
( Whimpering )

00:35.080 --> 00:37.080
( Warbling )

00:39.200 --> 00:40.220
( All scream )

00:40.320 --> 00:42.180
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Sorry.

00:42.280 --> 00:44.940
We didn't know
anyone was in here.
Please don't kill us.

00:45.040 --> 00:46.980
I'm afraid
we'll have to kill you.

00:47.080 --> 00:48.700
With kindness.

00:48.800 --> 00:50.500
( All speaking at once )

00:50.600 --> 00:52.580
Yes, we are Brocyclian
helper bots.

00:52.680 --> 00:55.140
We are programmed
to assist others in need.

00:55.240 --> 00:57.140
I am Râ656.

00:57.240 --> 01:00.060
This is Râ657, 8, and 9.

01:00.160 --> 01:02.860
Yeah, we can't wait
to help you.

01:02.960 --> 01:05.240
We saw you on our radar
and thought you might need help.

01:06.120 --> 01:07.620
Benson: Huddle!

01:07.720 --> 01:09.800
I don't know about these guys.
We shouldn't trust them.

01:09.880 --> 01:11.860
Guys,
we're drifting in space.

01:11.960 --> 01:13.420
They could be
our only chance.

01:13.520 --> 01:15.620
How do we know if they're
actually going to help us?

01:15.720 --> 01:17.460
We could just ask them.

01:17.560 --> 01:19.420
Well, who's gonna ask?

01:19.520 --> 01:21.500
Ugh, fine.

01:21.600 --> 01:23.900
Broâbots, can you help us
get back to Earth?

01:24.000 --> 01:25.340
Yes, let us show you.

01:25.440 --> 01:26.900
Skips: Huh.

01:27.000 --> 01:28.940
I can't believe
I never noticed this before.

01:29.040 --> 01:30.620
The organic fuel
synthesizer

01:30.720 --> 01:32.780
takes all natural resources
from your park

01:32.880 --> 01:34.900
and converts them
into fuel for your dome.

01:35.000 --> 01:36.300
Observe.

01:36.400 --> 01:37.540
( Whirs )

01:37.640 --> 01:39.180
( Beeping )

01:39.280 --> 01:41.260
Once the meter
reaches full capacity,

01:41.360 --> 01:43.940
you will have just enough power
to get you back to Earth.

01:44.040 --> 01:45.860
Wow.
You hear that, guys?

01:45.960 --> 01:48.380
Manual labor
is gonna save our lives.

01:48.480 --> 01:51.260
Everybody grab a Broâbot
and get to work.

01:51.360 --> 01:53.880
( Indistinct conversations )

01:54.760 --> 01:56.660
( Chuckles evilly )

01:56.760 --> 01:59.580
Dude, there's still something
shady about those guys.

01:59.680 --> 02:00.660
Let's follow them.

02:08.120 --> 02:10.120
( Both gasp )

02:23.640 --> 02:25.700
( Both gasp )

02:29.600 --> 02:31.600
( Both gasp )

02:39.640 --> 02:41.640
( Both gasp )

02:46.600 --> 02:47.700
( Smooches )

02:49.320 --> 02:51.780
Dude, maybe we're wrong
about these guys.

02:51.880 --> 02:54.180
They actually seem
pretty nice.
Yeah, <i>toonice!</i>

02:54.280 --> 02:56.400
They did say they were
gonna kill us with kindness.

02:56.480 --> 02:58.860
Killing is killing, dude.
You're being paranoid.

02:58.960 --> 03:01.180
Don't call me paranoid!
It makes me paranoid!

03:01.280 --> 03:03.280
Shh, shh. Wait.

03:09.880 --> 03:12.300
Aha! Aha!
What did I tell you?

03:12.400 --> 03:14.400
HmâHm!
Let's follow him.

03:17.240 --> 03:19.240
( Beeping )

03:20.080 --> 03:22.080
<i>Access granted.</i>

03:24.120 --> 03:25.740
Dude,
we got to get in there.

03:25.840 --> 03:26.980
How?
We're not robots.

03:27.080 --> 03:29.080
Hmm.

03:36.200 --> 03:37.700
( Beeping )

03:37.800 --> 03:41.060
011011.
011011.

03:41.160 --> 03:43.380
<i>Access granted.</i>

03:43.480 --> 03:47.520
Both: Zeroâoâoâoâo!

03:51.840 --> 03:56.420
Computer: State your bounty,
<i>Reaperâbot Râ659.</i>

03:56.520 --> 03:57.500
Reaperâbot?

03:57.600 --> 03:59.700
Computer, deposit ready.

03:59.800 --> 04:03.560
<i>Please place organic materials</i>
<i>in containment unit.</i>

04:06.280 --> 04:07.820
<i>Deposit accepted.</i>

04:07.920 --> 04:11.380
<i>Value on robot black market,</i>
<i>2,000 credits.</i>

04:11.480 --> 04:12.820
Aw, yeah.

04:12.920 --> 04:14.020
Stealing from others ââ

04:14.120 --> 04:16.100
what us Reaperâbots
do best.

04:16.200 --> 04:18.780
I can't believe they think
we're actually helping them.

04:18.880 --> 04:21.640
( Chuckles robotically )

04:23.320 --> 04:24.460
Those liars!

04:24.560 --> 04:26.560
They were playing us
right from the start.

04:26.120 --> 04:27.420
Look at all this stuff.

04:27.520 --> 04:29.440
They must be harvesting plants
from all over the galaxy.

04:29.520 --> 04:33.040
Whoa!
This one's crazeâo.

04:33.880 --> 04:35.880
Mordecai:
Dude, come here.

04:34.960 --> 04:36.960
You might
want to look at this.

04:40.920 --> 04:42.300
Reaperâbots?

04:42.400 --> 04:43.460
Really?

04:43.560 --> 04:44.580
It's true.

04:44.680 --> 04:46.680
They're stealing
all our plants

04:45.840 --> 04:47.840
and harvesting them
for their own.

04:47.280 --> 04:49.280
Rigby:
We saw it ourselves.

04:48.400 --> 04:49.660
That's ridiculous.

04:49.760 --> 04:51.760
They're the best thing
that's happened to us

04:51.560 --> 04:53.100
since we left Earth.

04:53.200 --> 04:55.340
They're the <i>onlything</i>
that's happened to us.

04:55.440 --> 04:57.860
Hello, friends.
You look parched.

04:57.960 --> 05:00.140
We converted this
terrible sour fruit

05:00.240 --> 05:03.540
into a sweet and refreshing
drink especially for you.

05:03.640 --> 05:06.300
Oh, nice.
Lemonade. My favorite.

05:06.400 --> 05:07.340
No! ( Grunts )

05:07.440 --> 05:08.780
We're not buying it,
Broâbots!

05:08.880 --> 05:11.580
Or should I say
Reaperâbots!

05:11.680 --> 05:15.420
We found your evil plan.
See?

05:15.520 --> 05:17.460
Yes, our plan
for helping you.

05:17.560 --> 05:19.380
But you drew X's
over our faces.

05:19.480 --> 05:22.220
The X's help to remind us
who to help.

05:22.320 --> 05:24.780
X marks the spot...
for helping.

05:24.880 --> 05:27.780
A likely story...
for a liar!

05:27.880 --> 05:29.580
Somebody tried
to warn us about you.

05:29.680 --> 05:32.300
Oh, wait,
that's just an advertisement.

05:32.400 --> 05:34.220
Read the whole text.
Huh?

05:34.320 --> 05:36.100
Both: "Trust no one...

05:36.200 --> 05:39.220
who says their pizza is better
than Papa Quasars"?

05:39.320 --> 05:40.860
Both: Whaâaâaâaâat?

05:40.960 --> 05:42.460
Hello, Earthlings.

05:42.560 --> 05:45.740
I brought this hot disk of
flour and cheese for you.

05:45.840 --> 05:46.940
See? Pizza.

05:47.040 --> 05:49.700
Are you guys
satisfied now?

05:49.800 --> 05:51.940
Pizza's the oldest trick
in the book!
Yeah.

05:52.040 --> 05:53.980
We still think you Broâbots
should leave.

05:54.080 --> 05:56.740
Wow, as a robot who can't
feel real emotions,

05:56.840 --> 05:58.920
I must say that hurt.

05:59.800 --> 06:01.580
Who says no
to free pizza?

06:01.680 --> 06:03.260
Not cool, bros.

06:03.360 --> 06:05.380
Why are you guys
being so mean to them?

06:05.480 --> 06:07.340
( All speaking angrily )

06:07.440 --> 06:09.260
I am detecting
mass tension.

06:09.360 --> 06:11.820
I guess we'll have to find
some other beings

06:11.920 --> 06:13.100
to enjoy our pizza with.

06:13.200 --> 06:14.660
No, no, wait!

06:14.760 --> 06:16.620
Don't go!
Please don't go.

06:16.720 --> 06:18.340
Don't listen to
those bozos.

06:18.440 --> 06:20.380
They were
just about to leave.

06:20.480 --> 06:23.280
But ââ
Just get inside, now!

06:27.640 --> 06:29.640
Stop!

06:30.000 --> 06:31.660
Hey, you almost hit him.

06:31.760 --> 06:32.740
How rude.

06:32.840 --> 06:33.780
Uh, yeah.

06:33.880 --> 06:35.500
I, uh, meant to do that.

06:35.600 --> 06:37.660
Who are you people?
I don't know.

06:37.760 --> 06:39.340
You don't know
who you are?

06:39.440 --> 06:42.220
Oh, I do. There's just
no time to explain.

06:42.320 --> 06:45.420
These Reaperâbots are
harvesting your natural
resources as we speak.

06:45.520 --> 06:47.060
You filthy metal heads

06:47.160 --> 06:49.380
only help others
to help yourselves.

06:49.480 --> 06:50.380
Unhâunh.

06:50.480 --> 06:52.060
Our motives are genuine.

06:52.160 --> 06:53.860
How can you trust
these people?

06:53.960 --> 06:55.620
They could be space pirates.

06:55.720 --> 06:57.820
Say that to my gun,
you Reaper scum!

06:57.920 --> 06:59.260
Park friends,

06:59.360 --> 07:01.360
think of all the nice things
we've done for you today.

07:01.120 --> 07:03.060
Does that not mean anything
to you?

07:12.240 --> 07:14.300
Well, this is certainly
a pickle.

07:14.400 --> 07:16.860
I'm not sure
who we can trust.

07:16.960 --> 07:19.060
I put my money
on the new guys.

07:19.160 --> 07:20.060
Look!

07:20.160 --> 07:22.160
( Roars )

07:24.000 --> 07:26.000
( Lows )

07:28.440 --> 07:30.500
What is that thing,
Broâbots?

07:30.600 --> 07:31.620
Oh, that?

07:31.720 --> 07:32.660
That's, uh ââ

07:32.760 --> 07:34.380
ah, who are we kidding?

07:34.480 --> 07:37.080
Reaperâbots, attack!

07:39.160 --> 07:40.700
Chance Sureshot:
Quick, this way.

07:40.800 --> 07:43.000
( All panting )

07:46.120 --> 07:48.480
Here, arm yourselves.
( Grunts )

07:54.480 --> 07:56.480
( Lows )

07:57.480 --> 08:00.040
( Laughs evilly )

08:01.040 --> 08:03.380
Hey, baby blue!
You want some more?

08:03.480 --> 08:05.480
Come get it!

08:06.160 --> 08:08.160
( Grunts )

08:19.320 --> 08:21.320
( Roars )

08:21.800 --> 08:24.380
We're gonna need
more firepower.

08:24.480 --> 08:26.480
Loud and clear.

08:34.280 --> 08:36.780
We need backup.
I repeat, backup.

08:36.880 --> 08:38.880
Aah!

08:41.360 --> 08:43.360
Pops: Aah!

08:49.480 --> 08:51.340
( Panting )

08:51.440 --> 08:53.620
Ow!

08:53.720 --> 08:55.720
Hole in one.

08:57.120 --> 08:59.100
( Laughs evilly )

08:59.200 --> 09:00.340
It's not working.

09:00.440 --> 09:02.020
( Laughs evilly )

09:02.120 --> 09:04.420
( Grunts )

09:04.520 --> 09:05.820
Aah!
( Groans )

09:05.920 --> 09:07.580
Dude,
you found his weak spot.

09:07.680 --> 09:09.680
Both: Aim for the beard!

09:12.400 --> 09:14.900
Aah!

09:15.000 --> 09:17.660
Hey, buddy,
I hate to bust your chops,

09:17.760 --> 09:19.760
but logging season is over.

09:22.560 --> 09:25.260
Looks like
we lumberâjacked him up.

09:25.360 --> 09:27.360
( Chuckles ) Not bad.

09:36.560 --> 09:39.140
Wow, those robots
really had us fooled.

09:39.240 --> 09:41.740
It's like my father
always told me.

09:41.840 --> 09:43.940
If someone's
being nice to you,

09:44.040 --> 09:46.580
they probably have
ulterior motives.

09:46.680 --> 09:48.420
Sorry we didn't
believe you guys.

09:48.520 --> 09:49.500
It's okay, Benson.

09:49.600 --> 09:50.660
Yeah, no hard feelings.

09:50.760 --> 09:52.140
Not everyone's
as smart as we is.

09:52.240 --> 09:55.320
Let's get to the control room.
We got to get out of here.

09:54.600 --> 09:56.020
Control room?

09:56.120 --> 09:58.120
Come on.

10:00.360 --> 10:02.360
This is just Pops' room.

10:03.880 --> 10:06.020
Is it?

10:06.120 --> 10:08.120
( Rumbling )

10:23.040 --> 10:25.040
Are you taking us
back to Earth?

10:26.160 --> 10:27.100
No.

10:27.200 --> 10:28.940
We've got other plans.
