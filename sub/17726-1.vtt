end up in jail.

I'll never do that to you again.

as you have overcome trials.

00:31.499 --> 00:34.702
- I don't think things are
going well for us anymore.

00:34.735 --> 00:38.072
- Respect each other
and each other's opinions.

00:38.106 --> 00:39.573
- You're all f---ing losers!

00:39.607 --> 00:41.575

into an asshole

see you like this, man.

00:51.352 --> 00:53.387
You f---ing deserve better,

00:53.421 --> 00:55.723

means no less.

00:55.756 --> 00:58.426
- She is f---ing a married man.

00:58.459 --> 00:59.727
- You've been throwing rocks.
- Why?

00:59.760 --> 01:01.562
Because I call you,
like, a whore?

01:01.595 --> 01:03.231
Call it as I see it.

01:03.264 --> 01:05.733
- Speak to each other
with words of appreciation.

01:05.766 --> 01:08.402
- You don't give a f---
about anyone but yourself.

01:08.436 --> 01:09.670

so...

01:09.703 --> 01:11.405

F--- this.

01:11.439 --> 01:14.375
- Stand resolute in your love
for each other...

01:14.408 --> 01:16.144
- I'm just scared
to commit to someone.

01:16.144 --> 01:17.545
- You put a ring
on my f---ing finger,

01:17.578 --> 01:19.313
so stop throwing it
in my f---ing face.

01:19.347 --> 01:20.681

01:20.714 --> 01:22.183
- Talk about how your dick
doesn't work either.

01:22.216 --> 01:23.751
- My dick works great.

01:23.784 --> 01:25.153
- Strive for harmony.

01:25.153 --> 01:27.155
- I'm done with Katie.
I'm not marrying her.

01:27.155 --> 01:28.222

What do you need?

02:21.675 --> 02:24.278
- Tall vodka soda
and a raspberry mojito.

right now.

they're Brittany's.

and it feel like

03:09.690 --> 03:12.860
it's just kind of closed in
a little bit now.

and I don't like
being around her.

- There was a time

03:25.172 --> 03:28.676

could actually be friends.

I am not good at right now.

Sometimes people will be like,

03:44.558 --> 03:46.193
"I'll take a sauvignon blanc
or--"

how to pronounce that."

fit in here at Sur.

She's friendly with everyone,
customers love her.

03:55.536 --> 03:57.405

and a shot of whiskey.

It's better than Hooters.

Are you coming tonight?
- Yeah, but I'm closer,

04:02.943 --> 04:04.778
so I'm gonna be the last one.

but this exact same party--

04:08.316 --> 04:10.318
was it two years ago?

04:10.318 --> 04:12.320
Like, we wouldn't even be
at the same table.

I am in such a good place
with Katie, Stassi, Kristen.

04:15.823 --> 04:17.791

I finally feel like

04:17.825 --> 04:19.327
it's the four of us.

04:19.327 --> 04:22.330
- You don't understand the logic
of being friends with Kristen.

04:22.363 --> 04:24.197
- I don't need to kiss her ass,
Katie.

04:24.231 --> 04:26.500
- Everybody take a deep breath
right f---ing now.

04:28.235 --> 04:30.103

for, like a couple years.

and it just didn't work.

04:34.074 --> 04:35.376
- What do you mean
by "everybody"?

04:35.409 --> 04:36.644
- I mean, if they
let me in there,

04:36.677 --> 04:38.011
then I guess they'll
let anybody in there.

04:38.045 --> 04:40.180
The "OK! Magazine" party
has almost become,

04:40.213 --> 04:42.383
like, the Sur Christmas party.

04:42.416 --> 04:45.786
You're gonna have some awkward
conversations with some people

04:45.819 --> 04:49.457
that maybe you don't wanna see
outside the workplace.

04:49.490 --> 04:51.258
And then you're gonna
overcompensate with booze

04:51.359 --> 04:53.093
and sh--'s probably gonna
hit the fan.

- Hi.

05:01.369 --> 05:03.270

05:03.371 --> 05:04.472
- I was doing a film.

05:04.505 --> 05:06.073
- One that I could see?

05:06.106 --> 05:08.876
- Do you watch porn?

05:08.909 --> 05:10.110
- Sometimes.

05:10.143 --> 05:12.646
I'd like to say,
"How do you ask me that?

05:12.680 --> 05:14.281
Of course not.
Never."

05:14.382 --> 05:16.417
But then I'd be lying.

05:16.450 --> 05:18.819
It's not a porn film really,
is it?

Gren--Gren-yay?

05:34.101 --> 05:37.304
But I think if I were to star
in my own porno,

05:37.405 --> 05:39.139
it would be "In Lala Land",

05:39.172 --> 05:41.575

05:59.660 --> 06:01.161
So has Ariana.
So has Lala.

06:03.096 --> 06:05.298
to ruin my engagement party
last summer,

I have done my best to keep them
out of my life completely.

for that sh--.

I'm gonna text Kristen

06:33.961 --> 06:36.296
and let her know
that we'll be coming early...

06:36.329 --> 06:37.631
- Let her know James
will be there.

06:37.665 --> 06:39.833
- But also that,
uh, her best friend

06:39.867 --> 06:41.301
is gonna come too, James.
- Yeah.

06:41.334 --> 06:42.836

help me pick outfits,

07:03.657 --> 07:05.759

could give zero f---s.

07:05.793 --> 07:07.495

[laughs]

07:07.528 --> 07:08.762

07:08.796 --> 07:10.263
Just looks
in the other direction.

07:10.297 --> 07:12.600
Things are
pretty f---ing fantastic.

Carter and I have been together
about ten months now.

07:19.106 --> 07:21.308
[soft dramatic music]

07:21.341 --> 07:24.011
- And when I dated Sandoval,
I paid all of his bills,

07:24.044 --> 07:27.380
and James treated me like
a walking ATM.

07:27.414 --> 07:29.517
So it's so nice
to be in a relationship

07:29.517 --> 07:31.919
with someone like Carter
where things are equal.

07:31.952 --> 07:33.053

are definitely going.

07:42.663 --> 07:44.231
- James and Lala are going?

07:44.264 --> 07:46.099
- That sucks.

07:46.133 --> 07:48.702

like welcoming somebody

07:48.736 --> 07:51.705
who is disgusting to my friend.

07:51.739 --> 07:54.074
Lala has been a f---ing
giant ---- to Katie.

07:54.107 --> 07:56.544
I hate the word ----.
I hate the C word,

07:56.544 --> 07:58.612
but this just feels like
the right time for me to use it.

07:58.646 --> 08:00.380
- So don't wear
my fake engagement ring?

08:00.548 --> 08:03.350
- No fake engagement ring.

08:03.383 --> 08:06.253
We're trying to convince people
that you're not a psycho,

08:06.286 --> 08:08.556

08:19.833 --> 08:22.002
- Hello.
- How are you?

08:22.035 --> 08:23.203
You look gorgeous.
- I'm good.

08:23.236 --> 08:24.437
- Cool.
- I'm worried about you.

08:24.471 --> 08:25.673
You're okay?
- Yeah.

08:25.706 --> 08:26.807
Things are getting
a little better.

08:26.840 --> 08:28.576
You know, it's not the time
for talk about,

08:28.576 --> 08:30.010
like, my personal sh--
right now, but...

08:30.043 --> 08:32.379
- No, but I knew you said
your father was...

08:32.412 --> 08:33.914
- Yeah, my dad left.

08:33.947 --> 08:35.248
- Well, you told me
he was going to.

08:35.282 --> 08:36.984
- Well, he left officially
yesterday.

08:37.017 --> 08:38.619
- You've been really good
with the drinking.

08:38.652 --> 08:41.088
You've got it
all under control lately.

08:41.121 --> 08:42.890
- Yeah,
I've had a good little run.

08:42.923 --> 08:44.858
- No, I know,
but we wanna keep that up.

08:44.892 --> 08:46.894
- Yeah.
- So it's when you get emotional

08:46.927 --> 08:49.329
that sometimes
things start to go awry.

08:49.362 --> 08:51.231
James is very reactive.

08:51.264 --> 08:52.900
He lets things
get out of control.

08:52.933 --> 08:54.467
- I did not spit
on any f---ing girl,

08:54.501 --> 08:56.169
so don't f---ing tell me
that I am when I didn't--

08:56.203 --> 08:57.971
- Hey, stop it right now.

08:58.005 --> 08:59.172
Stop it right now.

08:59.206 --> 09:00.874
- He said, "You're not talented.

09:00.908 --> 09:03.143
"You're nothing.
You're beneath me.

09:03.176 --> 09:05.478

I'm James Kennedy."

[soft dramatic music]

09:06.947 --> 09:08.716
- I think Ken and I
have done our utmost

09:08.749 --> 09:11.384
to really try and set him
on the straight and narrow,

09:11.418 --> 09:13.453
but we've only got
so much patience,

09:13.486 --> 09:14.955
and our patience is running out.

09:14.988 --> 09:17.424
Just want you to stay chill.

09:17.457 --> 09:18.692
- All right.
Well, thank you, Lisa.

09:18.726 --> 09:20.628
I appreciate that.
- I gotta tell you something.

09:20.628 --> 09:21.862
- Now, so a couple nights ago,

09:21.895 --> 09:23.697
I came home
about 3:00 in the morning,

09:23.731 --> 09:25.799
and Kristen and, uh, Brittany
are at the house...

09:25.833 --> 09:27.167
- Okay, cool.
- And so I'm like, "Okay.

09:27.200 --> 09:28.535
Well, I'll be home later."

09:28.636 --> 09:29.837
It comes around 3:00
in the morning,

09:29.870 --> 09:32.005
I come strolling in, right?
I walk through the door,

09:32.039 --> 09:34.074
and I'm like,
"Where the hell is everybody?"

09:34.107 --> 09:35.643
So I go,
I walk back into my bedroom,

09:35.676 --> 09:37.745
I open up the door,
and guess what I see.

09:37.778 --> 09:41.348
I see Brittany and Kristen...

09:41.381 --> 09:42.549
on the bed.

09:42.650 --> 09:43.884
I heard noises
coming through my bedroom,

09:43.917 --> 09:45.318
so I walk in the bedroom

09:45.352 --> 09:47.554
and I see Kristen...

09:47.655 --> 09:49.657

09:49.690 --> 09:52.225
Kissing Brittany...

09:52.259 --> 09:53.661
down south.

09:53.694 --> 09:55.162
I just instantly went,
"What the f---?"

09:55.195 --> 09:56.930
Got mad and this and that, and
just stormed out of the house.

09:56.964 --> 09:59.099
- Of course you flipped out.
- Stormed out of the house.

09:59.132 --> 10:00.734
- You're a jealous asshole.
- I was.

10:00.768 --> 10:02.302
- There is no shortage

10:02.335 --> 10:06.273
of bi-curious southern girls
in West Hollywood.

10:06.306 --> 10:08.041
Why, oh, why

10:08.075 --> 10:11.344
does Kristen have to pick
Jax's girlfriend?

10:11.378 --> 10:12.880
- I was always
the kind of guy that went,

10:12.913 --> 10:14.247
"Well, I don't care if my girl
hooks up with another girl.

10:14.281 --> 10:15.548
I was always that,
but then once it happens,

10:15.582 --> 10:16.717
you're kind of like,

10:16.750 --> 10:18.018
"I don't know
if I like it or not."

10:18.051 --> 10:20.553
- Did Kristen just Jax Jax?
- I got Jaxed.

10:20.587 --> 10:22.055
- He's gonna tell everybody.

10:22.089 --> 10:24.825
It's a whole lot of fuss
over a little cunnilingus.

10:24.858 --> 10:27.294
Welcome to LA.

10:27.327 --> 10:28.962
It's the LA handshake.

10:28.996 --> 10:30.798
- I'm just gonna
chalk it up there as leverage.

10:30.831 --> 10:32.332
I got Jaxed by Kristen.

10:33.667 --> 10:35.402

get out of here early now.

10:49.616 --> 10:50.751

I really wanna

10:50.784 --> 10:52.485
go over to that party.

10:52.519 --> 10:55.022
- Hello.
- Hey, Lisa.

10:55.055 --> 10:56.523
- That is the biggest pour.

10:56.556 --> 10:58.358
Is that why
I'm not making money?

Nobody pours a glass of rosé--
- It's for you, it's for you.

11:00.460 --> 11:02.095
- And how do you
want that prepared?

11:02.129 --> 11:04.364
- Uh, medium rare?
- Medium rare.

11:04.397 --> 11:05.565
- Brittany's doing
really well here.

11:05.598 --> 11:07.034
- She's doing great.
Everyone loves her here.

11:07.067 --> 11:08.235
- Yeah, exactly.
- Everyone's--you know?

11:08.268 --> 11:09.536
I'm just gonna not work--
try and not work

11:09.569 --> 11:11.071
the same days as her.
I don't think it's healthy

11:11.104 --> 11:12.539
to be working together
and living together.

11:12.572 --> 11:13.807
I don't think it's healthy.
- Speaking of working.

11:13.841 --> 11:15.142
Uh, you making drinks over her
or what?

11:15.175 --> 11:16.744
- I'd interviewed Brittany
a couple of times.

11:16.744 --> 11:19.246
I mean, how do I know
that you can even bartend?

11:19.279 --> 11:20.413
Have you got a résumé?

11:20.447 --> 11:22.049
- I do not have a résumé
with me, no.

11:22.082 --> 11:24.451
- I'm not into, you know,
somebody walking in here,

11:24.484 --> 11:26.519
and just because they're
in a relationship with Jax

11:26.553 --> 11:27.821
thinking that they can come here

11:27.855 --> 11:29.522
and giggle and smooch...
- No, no.

11:29.556 --> 11:31.759
- Because that's
not working for me.

11:31.792 --> 11:34.261
But we had a couple of weeks
where we were slammed.

11:34.294 --> 11:36.797
I don't like having couples
work together,

11:36.830 --> 11:38.065
but I think at this point,

11:38.098 --> 11:40.600
I'll probably keep Brittany
over Jax.

11:40.633 --> 11:43.771
- Jax walked in
on Brittany and, uh, Kristen.

11:43.771 --> 11:45.272
Kristen was
going down on Brittany.

tell her that?

11:49.109 --> 11:50.778

going down on Brittany.

11:50.811 --> 11:52.780
- You're lying.
Will you just get back to work?

11:52.813 --> 11:55.015
- Go ask her.

11:55.048 --> 11:57.150
- What do you think
I'm going to ask her?

11:57.184 --> 11:59.820
- How was it?
[both laugh]

11:59.853 --> 12:01.354
- I mean,
if it was anybody else,

12:01.388 --> 12:02.890
I don't think I'd believe it,

12:02.923 --> 12:05.058
but Kristen

12:05.092 --> 12:08.428
chowing down on Kentucky muffin?

12:08.461 --> 12:10.864
You don't think this is
kind of vaguely bizarre?

12:10.898 --> 12:13.033
Real--even in
your befuddled world?

12:13.066 --> 12:14.567
- I feel like it's karma.

12:14.601 --> 12:16.403
I feel like it's just coming
back to bite me a little bit.

12:16.436 --> 12:18.271
- That's not karma, dude.
- Yeah, it is.

12:18.305 --> 12:19.973

you'd be dead by now.

out of town.

and make up

and her boyfriends.

a lot of getting to know myself

12:50.437 --> 12:51.738
over the last year.

12:51.839 --> 12:54.041
I never thought that Kristen

12:54.074 --> 12:56.944
would be the one
in the stable relationship

12:56.977 --> 13:00.480
and I'm the one
in this roller coaster.

13:00.513 --> 13:01.849

13:01.882 --> 13:04.251
Remember the last time we were
at an "OK! Magazine" party?

13:04.284 --> 13:05.452
I hated Kristen

13:05.485 --> 13:07.320

and talk to 'em.

13:07.354 --> 13:09.589
I think you should just
come back and work at Sur,

13:09.622 --> 13:11.358

all the time.

she terrorizes Katie.

13:21.368 --> 13:22.669

Katie hated you,

13:22.702 --> 13:24.004
and you guys had falling outs
and you too.

13:24.037 --> 13:26.039
- That's 'cause she loves me
and she loves Kristen.

13:26.073 --> 13:27.574
- I know, I know, but listen.
And then she would ask me

13:27.607 --> 13:28.909
to inherit those grudges
and say, "You better--

You did it!

over there.

a couple of wasted kisses.

Brittany and I were hammered
and whatever.

- I want you to know
in case you hear it

14:36.143 --> 14:37.710
through the grapevine.
- You gossiped.

14:37.744 --> 14:39.512
- I did.
But I want you to know

14:39.546 --> 14:41.314

Do you have my phone?

I can Snapchat now.

I need to Snapchat!

14:51.224 --> 14:53.460

14:53.493 --> 14:55.963
- Anyone who moves
across the country like I did

14:55.996 --> 14:58.865
are going to miss their family,
miss their friends back home,

14:58.966 --> 15:01.834

such a great group of girls,

15:01.868 --> 15:03.770
I couldn't imagine
my life without 'em now.

15:07.474 --> 15:09.476
- I think you did a little bit
more than making out.

15:10.743 --> 15:12.980
- What I saw was not making out.
- Okay, I need a drink.

15:17.417 --> 15:19.386
- It really wasn't much up here.

15:20.787 --> 15:22.389
It wasn't this.
It was more like this.

spread around about them,

the one spreading the rumor,

am I in,

doing this?

15:47.014 --> 15:48.581
[door opens]

15:48.615 --> 15:51.518
- First time getting ready
in the girls' bathroom.

15:51.551 --> 15:53.020
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

15:53.020 --> 15:55.722
- Dude, so...

15:55.755 --> 15:59.559
Jax walked in one night
after being out late,

15:59.592 --> 16:02.262
and Kristen's
going down on Brittany.

16:02.295 --> 16:04.097
- What the f---?

16:04.131 --> 16:06.933
- Face deep, you know?
- Ew, grody.

16:07.034 --> 16:08.701
- I'm serious.
- Dude, you can't go to sleep

16:08.735 --> 16:10.403
when Kristen's around

16:10.437 --> 16:11.904
or that's what happens.

16:11.938 --> 16:14.674
- I guess so.
- Good lord.

16:14.707 --> 16:16.576
So there was a very long time

16:16.609 --> 16:19.279
in which Kristen was known
as Crazy Kristen.

16:19.312 --> 16:20.913
- Leave right now.
- Suck a dick.

16:20.947 --> 16:22.682
- Leave.
- Walk the f--- away.

16:22.715 --> 16:23.850
Bye.
- This is my fault, dude.

16:23.883 --> 16:25.052
- She's the ----

16:25.052 --> 16:26.953
who hooked up
with my f---ing boyfriend.

16:27.054 --> 16:29.122
- So now what is it gonna be?

16:29.156 --> 16:30.723
Cunnilingus Kristen?

16:30.757 --> 16:33.460
[laughs]
I like it.

16:33.493 --> 16:35.362
There's a ring to that.

16:35.395 --> 16:36.563
- Ready?

16:36.596 --> 16:38.431
- Ready.
- Let's go hit up that open bar.

16:38.465 --> 16:41.834
*

16:41.868 --> 16:43.270
- I mean, like, I can't not--
- Can we just take a moment

16:43.303 --> 16:45.972
to acknowledge how weird it is--
how--actually, how nice it is

16:46.073 --> 16:47.707
that you guys
are sitting together

16:47.740 --> 16:49.409
and you're cordial again.

16:49.442 --> 16:51.244
- I need a drink.
Stassi and I,

16:51.278 --> 16:52.812
I don't think
we'll ever be best buds,

16:52.845 --> 16:54.781
but I've been trying
to kind of

16:54.814 --> 16:56.749
talk to Stassi more
and kind of,

16:56.783 --> 16:58.951
you know, I don't wanna say
rekindle a friendship,

16:58.985 --> 17:01.454
but kind of just, you know,
get in a good rapport with her.

17:01.488 --> 17:02.689
So...
[laughs]

17:02.722 --> 17:04.091
I know this is gonna be crazy,

17:04.091 --> 17:07.094
but, um, so about
a week and a half ago,

17:07.094 --> 17:09.162
I came home from Sur
about 3:00 in the morning,

17:09.196 --> 17:10.463
I was a little tipsy from work,

17:10.497 --> 17:13.333
and I find Kristen

17:13.366 --> 17:15.402
between Brittany's legs.

17:15.435 --> 17:16.736
[soft dramatic music]

17:16.769 --> 17:18.105
[overlapping chatter]

17:18.138 --> 17:19.472
- Do you mean between her,
like--

17:19.506 --> 17:23.009
- Kristen was, like...

17:23.110 --> 17:24.377
eating vag.
The be--

17:24.411 --> 17:26.813
- Wait, I'm sorry.
I'm still trying to process

17:26.846 --> 17:28.615
what you're trying to say
and trying to figure out

17:28.648 --> 17:30.016
if you're full of sh--.
- I'm just curious

17:30.117 --> 17:32.419
what you would think if you were
in the situation that I was in.

17:32.452 --> 17:33.553
- Well, if my dude was

17:33.586 --> 17:35.288
going down on another dude,
I...

17:35.322 --> 17:38.758
You, Kristen,
and maybe Brittany too

17:38.791 --> 17:40.760
should probably just
chop of your private parts

17:40.793 --> 17:42.329
because none of this is normal.

17:42.362 --> 17:43.996
*

17:44.030 --> 17:46.133
- Summer time's already begun.
- [chuckles]

17:46.133 --> 17:47.600
- How fast is that, huh?

17:47.634 --> 17:50.570
- James and I
always roll as a pair.

17:50.603 --> 17:52.439
- Quite a mix, right?
What do you think?

17:52.472 --> 17:55.142
- Last year,
he was trying so hard

17:55.175 --> 17:56.376
to get into my pants.

17:56.409 --> 17:57.810
- Excited to sit
with your friends?

17:57.844 --> 17:59.146
- No, I'm not.
[laughs]

17:59.146 --> 18:02.149
I flopped the legs open
and just let him have it.

18:02.149 --> 18:04.284
I felt like
he had finally earned it,

18:04.317 --> 18:06.786
and oddly enough,
he's over it and so am I.

18:06.819 --> 18:08.888
We're just best friends now.

18:08.921 --> 18:10.357
- Here's to a fun night.

18:10.390 --> 18:12.525
[electronic music]

18:12.559 --> 18:15.428
- Hi, love.
- We have some memories here.

18:15.462 --> 18:17.930
Your birthday twice in a row.

18:17.964 --> 18:20.567
Last time we came here
when I threw up.

18:20.600 --> 18:22.535
- Hey, guys.
What's up?

18:25.037 --> 18:26.739
- No, this is exactly
where I need to be.

18:26.773 --> 18:28.708
- Oh, actually,
I don't think so.

18:28.741 --> 18:30.177
- Hey, Stassi.
How are you?

18:30.177 --> 18:31.878
Hey, Jax.
Looking sharp.

18:31.911 --> 18:33.413
- I feel like
y'all know better right now.

18:33.446 --> 18:35.415
It's kind of rude
to actually,

18:35.448 --> 18:38.651
like, talk sh--
on every single person here

18:38.685 --> 18:40.587
and then come over
and drink our alcohol.

18:40.620 --> 18:41.821
- I didn't talk sh--
about anybody.

18:41.854 --> 18:43.055
- They can't afford
their own table.

18:43.089 --> 18:44.557
It's okay.

18:44.591 --> 18:46.193
- You get some work done?
You look good.

18:46.193 --> 18:47.860
Your nose looks so good.

18:47.894 --> 18:49.629
Where's Shay?
Was he not invited?

18:49.662 --> 18:51.231
Your husband?
- He's actually at the studio.

18:51.264 --> 18:52.565
Actually making money
and making music.

18:52.599 --> 18:53.800
- Oh, the studio.
Right.

19:01.441 --> 19:04.777
After all the sh-- that
Lala's been talking about me,

19:04.811 --> 19:06.846
she's gonna come over
to our table

19:06.879 --> 19:08.448
and drink our alcohol?

19:08.481 --> 19:10.116
I don't f---ing think so, honey.

19:10.217 --> 19:11.484
- I don't think
you guys should be here.

19:11.518 --> 19:12.852
- How about a "hello" Schwartz?
- Maybe at another table,

19:12.885 --> 19:14.721
but not here.
- I am perfectly willing

19:14.754 --> 19:16.022
to work with Lala,

19:16.055 --> 19:17.490
but I really
don't wanna be seeing her

19:17.524 --> 19:18.791
at the same party as me.

19:18.825 --> 19:20.527
- Hey, I'm not trying
to fight you tonight.

19:20.560 --> 19:21.961
How you doing?
- I'm not gonna shake your hand.

19:21.994 --> 19:23.430
- You gonna shake my hand?
- I'm not gonna shake your hand.

19:23.463 --> 19:24.697
- No.
- Last summer,

19:24.731 --> 19:26.233
I stole a pair of sunglasses

19:26.233 --> 19:28.235
because I'm on probation,
it's gonna be a few more months

19:28.235 --> 19:29.336
till I bash his face in.

19:29.369 --> 19:31.137
- I can see that everybody here

19:31.238 --> 19:33.440
has not been working
on their summer bodies.

19:33.473 --> 19:35.742
[dramatic music]

19:35.775 --> 19:37.076
- Wait, are you pregnant?

19:37.109 --> 19:38.711
*

19:38.745 --> 19:40.713
Oh, my God.
Congratulations.

19:40.747 --> 19:43.115
- Go. Go.
- You're just ridiculous.

19:43.149 --> 19:45.318
- How old is this kid
and why the f--- is he around?

19:45.352 --> 19:46.686
You need to f---ing go.

19:46.719 --> 19:48.120
- You can't--
- Dude, go!

19:48.154 --> 19:50.523
Get the f--- out of here.
Get the f--- out of here.

19:50.557 --> 19:51.924
- No, I have to make
another one.

19:51.958 --> 19:53.893
You ruined my Yeezy's, nearly.
- Jax, I'm sorry.

19:53.926 --> 19:56.363
Get the f--- away.
F---ing sleazy sh--.

19:56.396 --> 19:59.932
- You think coming up to me
and calling me fat, pregnant...

19:59.966 --> 20:02.602
- Dude, go away.
James, just walk away.

20:02.635 --> 20:04.904
*

20:04.937 --> 20:05.972
Dude.
- You f---ing moron.

20:06.005 --> 20:07.206
- Don't do it.
Sit down.

20:07.240 --> 20:09.942
- Jax, Jax, stop!
all: Jax!

20:09.976 --> 20:11.844
- You go near Katie
ever again...

20:11.878 --> 20:14.914
- What? What? What? What?
- I will floor you, bitch.

20:14.947 --> 20:17.183
- Don't f--- with this group.

20:21.721 --> 20:22.088
[dramatic music]

20:25.558 --> 20:26.693
- Don't do it.
Sit down.

20:26.726 --> 20:30.129
- Stop, Jax.
all: Jax!

20:30.162 --> 20:31.431
- You know what?
I don't care if I go to jail.

20:31.464 --> 20:32.999
I just really need
to hit this guy.

20:33.032 --> 20:34.901
It'll just feel good.
It'll be totally worth it.

20:34.934 --> 20:36.102
- Ah, dude.
- Come on. Come on.

20:36.135 --> 20:38.037
- No, no, no, Jax.
- What the f--- is it?

20:38.070 --> 20:40.373
- Katie, back the f--- away.
God damn!

20:40.407 --> 20:42.241
I'm trying to sit
at this f---ing table

20:42.275 --> 20:45.945
like you told us too.
- I am so f---ing embarrassed.

20:45.978 --> 20:47.814
Like, for real,
I believe in aliens.

20:47.847 --> 20:49.081
James and Lala are,

20:49.115 --> 20:51.183
like, two tall Greys that,
like, have come down

20:51.217 --> 20:53.185
and they shape-shifted
into human beings

20:53.219 --> 20:55.455
because they're
f---ing disgusting.

20:55.488 --> 20:57.457
- You go near Katie
ever again...

20:57.490 --> 21:00.427
- What? What? What? What?
- I will floor you, bitch.

21:00.460 --> 21:01.894
Don't f--- with this group.

21:01.928 --> 21:04.331
- Have I said
some hurtful things to them

21:04.331 --> 21:05.565
or about them?

21:05.598 --> 21:06.999
Absolutely.

21:07.033 --> 21:08.200
But for them to walk around

21:08.234 --> 21:10.403
acting like
their sh-- don't stink.

21:10.437 --> 21:12.171
Get the f--- over it.
- That's it.

21:12.204 --> 21:13.606
I'm cutting it.

21:13.640 --> 21:15.174
I'm cutting that dress.

21:15.207 --> 21:16.976
- I am so embarrassed.
I wanna leave.

21:17.009 --> 21:18.845
I wanna go so bad right now.
- Let's leave.

21:18.878 --> 21:20.680
- I'm so embarrassed.
- Ew.

21:20.713 --> 21:22.181
- Don't slip.
Don't slip.

21:22.214 --> 21:24.417
It's all wet everywhere.

21:24.451 --> 21:27.354
Y'alls friend came over here
calling her fat.

21:27.354 --> 21:29.722
- Who--what?
- James and Lala.

21:29.756 --> 21:31.991
Real classy.
Asked her if she's pregnant.

21:32.024 --> 21:35.027
Asked me how my nose job was.
Took our alcohol.

21:35.061 --> 21:37.764
- Let me open it.
Let me--don't ruin your teeth.

21:37.797 --> 21:40.032
- And that whore
who has not a f---ing cell

21:40.066 --> 21:43.069
in her f---ing brain.
Like, she is f---ing done.

21:43.102 --> 21:44.937
Like--
- Those are horrible people.

21:44.971 --> 21:47.239
- What the f---?

21:47.273 --> 21:49.809
I literally just saw them

21:49.842 --> 21:52.011
and they gave no indication
that they were planning--

21:52.044 --> 21:53.780
- Well, you--I mean,
you don't have to believe us,

21:53.813 --> 21:55.014
but we're telling you
what happened.

21:55.047 --> 21:56.516
- James is out of control.
Just busted this sh--...

21:56.549 --> 21:58.217
- No, I--no, I'm not denying
that it happened.

21:58.250 --> 21:59.386
- I know that
you guys are close now.

21:59.419 --> 22:00.820
You guys, like, hang out
or whatever.

22:00.853 --> 22:02.522
- Stop, don't do that to them.
Don't make her feel guilty--

22:02.555 --> 22:04.023
- I'm not I'm just saying
I know you're close,

22:04.056 --> 22:05.692
I'm not, like, trying to put you
in an uncomfortable position

22:05.725 --> 22:07.527
like that.
- Oh, they're acquaintances.

22:07.560 --> 22:09.729
They're not friends.
Tom's friends with me.

22:09.762 --> 22:11.464
Don't insult Tom.

22:11.498 --> 22:13.299
- I feel awkward already.
- Don't go over there.

22:13.400 --> 22:15.201
- Sit down.
Grab a seat.

22:15.234 --> 22:18.070
- Tom has still not learned
in six years

22:18.104 --> 22:20.640
how to be, like,
supportive or back me up.

22:20.673 --> 22:22.842
Just because my opinion
is different than yours

22:22.875 --> 22:24.844
and I'm voicing it,

22:24.877 --> 22:26.613
doesn't mean I'm "dramatic."

22:26.646 --> 22:27.847
- Let's take a cheers

22:27.880 --> 22:30.650
to, uh, Schwartz and Katie's,
uh, wedding.

22:30.683 --> 22:32.785
- Let's take a cheers to me
f---ing Schwartz and Katie!

22:32.819 --> 22:35.021
- Wait, I need to make another!

22:35.054 --> 22:38.525
Here's a cheers to,
um, Schwartz and Katie's wedding

22:38.558 --> 22:39.992
not ending in misery.

22:42.595 --> 22:43.763
- He's not.
They're cordial.

22:43.796 --> 22:45.064
Are you gonna do that
to everybody?

22:45.097 --> 22:48.501
- No, I'm not.
I'm not recruiting anybody.

22:48.535 --> 22:50.870
- We're all fat.
Katie's pregnant.

22:50.903 --> 22:52.171
We haven't worked
on our summer bodies.

22:52.204 --> 22:53.906
- Katie's been backsliding a lot

22:53.940 --> 22:55.341
since Stassi came back
in the picture.

22:55.442 --> 22:56.876
I mean,
she's been drinking more.

22:56.909 --> 22:58.878
She's been talking sh-- more.

22:58.911 --> 23:00.312
I refuse to go
through another year

23:00.346 --> 23:03.550
of Katie expecting me
to inherit her grudges.

23:03.583 --> 23:05.017
I'm just not gonna do it.

23:05.051 --> 23:06.686
- Tom Schwartz is...

23:06.719 --> 23:07.954
- Yeah.
- You know...

23:07.987 --> 23:10.857
- Terrible lay.
- Into his fat girlfriend.

23:10.890 --> 23:13.292
- Out of those six over there,
who's crazy?

23:13.325 --> 23:15.662
- They're all f---ing nutbags.
- Who's the craziest?

23:15.695 --> 23:17.630
- Well, no, no, no, no--
- Let's say who's craziest

23:17.664 --> 23:20.166
at the same time.
One, two, three...

23:20.199 --> 23:21.333
- Scheana.
- Stassi.

23:21.367 --> 23:23.035
- [laughs]

23:23.069 --> 23:24.871
- What's up, guys?
- Oh, Thomas.

23:24.904 --> 23:26.539
- Hi, love.
- What's up, man?

23:26.573 --> 23:28.475
What the f--- happened
over there?

23:28.475 --> 23:30.309
- Nothing.
They were dis-welcoming.

23:30.342 --> 23:32.479
They didn't wanna say "hi."
- Dude, you rolled up there,

23:32.512 --> 23:33.913
grabbed their f---ing drinks,

23:33.946 --> 23:35.582
started f---ing
bitching everybody out,

23:35.615 --> 23:38.317
slung f---ing cranberry.
Why?

23:38.350 --> 23:40.052
- You need to hear
my side of the story

23:40.086 --> 23:41.588
before you judge.
- James, I just know

23:41.621 --> 23:44.356
the end result.
- Oh, my God.

23:44.390 --> 23:45.892
- Look, I like James,

23:45.925 --> 23:48.495
but James's biggest enemy
is himself,

23:48.528 --> 23:50.930
and people know how
to push James's buttons.

23:50.963 --> 23:52.364
It's really easy.

23:52.398 --> 23:54.834
They're big, red buttons

23:54.867 --> 23:56.769
that say "push here."

23:56.803 --> 23:59.105
- The first person to throw
a drink on me was Scheana.

23:59.138 --> 24:00.873
- Well, I would have
thrown a drink on you too

24:00.907 --> 24:02.642
if you would have called
my girlfriend pregnant.

24:02.675 --> 24:04.711
- 100%, but she doesn't
look pregnant, does she?

24:04.744 --> 24:06.178
'Cause Ariana's still
hot as f---.

24:06.212 --> 24:07.379
- Dude, shut up, man.

24:07.413 --> 24:09.549
- If Ariana was
in her f---ing shoes,

24:09.582 --> 24:10.983
you wouldn't be happy.

24:11.017 --> 24:12.752
- I wouldn't give a f---,
actually.

24:12.785 --> 24:14.987
- Oh, really, really?
- No, I would not give a f---.

24:15.021 --> 24:16.923
Tom Sandoval,
they're wise words.

24:16.956 --> 24:18.357
- One thing about James and Lala
is that

24:18.390 --> 24:20.793
they can both have
extreme personalities,

24:20.827 --> 24:22.962
but when they're both
on that wavelength,

24:22.995 --> 24:26.032
like, there's no one there
to calm the other one down.

24:26.065 --> 24:28.167
You're like a Tourette's
of f---ing insults, James.

24:28.200 --> 24:29.536
- Fine.
Don't give me

24:29.569 --> 24:32.038
your f---ing encyclopedia,
Yoda bullsh--.

24:32.071 --> 24:33.573
- You've gotta control that,
man!

24:33.606 --> 24:35.274
- I'm young and I'm hurt...
- Because you know what--no.

24:35.307 --> 24:36.442
You're young and your hurt?
- And you know my dad left

24:36.543 --> 24:38.611
yesterday.
My dad left me yesterday.

24:38.645 --> 24:41.013
He left the country.
- Get in f---ing line, James!

24:41.047 --> 24:42.949
My parents got divorced too.

24:42.982 --> 24:45.552
I don't use that as an excuse
to act like a f---ing asshole.

24:45.552 --> 24:48.420
- My dad left yesterday.
Don't you f---ing talk.

24:48.454 --> 24:51.257
Last summer my parents started
to have some problems,

24:51.290 --> 24:53.626
and, you know,
things haven't gotten better.

24:53.660 --> 24:56.428
I just don't understand
how you and dad are breaking up.

24:56.462 --> 24:58.330
I've been going through
a really hard time with this.

24:58.364 --> 25:00.567
- I need to live my life
and so does he.

25:00.600 --> 25:02.368
It's hard.
Don't cry.

25:02.401 --> 25:05.437
- As of yesterday,
my dad moved back to London,

25:05.471 --> 25:07.239
but, like, I haven't dealt
with any of it.

25:07.273 --> 25:09.576
Are you the person I should be
talking to about this?

25:09.576 --> 25:11.678
- Apparently.
- I thought they were gonna

25:11.711 --> 25:14.581
get back together,
and it didn't work out, bro.

25:14.581 --> 25:17.283
It didn't work out.
- Dude, stop, stop, stop.

25:17.316 --> 25:20.052
Come on.
- [crying]

25:20.086 --> 25:22.054
- You're all right.
You're all right.

25:22.088 --> 25:25.592
*

25:25.625 --> 25:26.993
- Thomas,

25:27.026 --> 25:30.262
I just don't know
how to deal with this.

25:30.296 --> 25:33.499
- Ariana, I feel like
you do need to know,

25:33.600 --> 25:37.036
one of my really close friends

25:37.069 --> 25:38.805
is very close

25:38.838 --> 25:41.808
with her boyfriend's wife.

25:41.841 --> 25:44.811
For reals.

25:48.480 --> 25:51.050
- It's f---ing--it is so weird.
- I don't know.

25:51.083 --> 25:52.819
- Stupid Lala forgets
that we have

25:52.852 --> 25:54.320
a sh-- ton of mutual friends,

25:54.353 --> 25:57.056
and it didn't take me very long
to find out that

25:57.089 --> 25:59.659
Lala isn't just a sugar baby,

25:59.692 --> 26:03.062
but her sugar daddy
is married with children.

26:03.095 --> 26:06.432
- Someone else's husband
is not your boyfriend.

26:06.465 --> 26:07.900
I'm sorry, honey.

26:11.503 --> 26:14.206
- I don't know
who Lala is dating.

26:14.240 --> 26:18.210
However,
I will treat a rumor as such

26:18.244 --> 26:19.879
until proven fact

26:19.912 --> 26:21.648
because she's my friend.

26:21.681 --> 26:25.084
*

26:25.117 --> 26:28.454
There are people over there,

26:28.487 --> 26:29.722
and I'm not gonna say anything

26:29.756 --> 26:31.023
about f---ing groups...
- I know--

26:31.057 --> 26:32.925
- 'Cause I'm not about groups.

26:32.959 --> 26:35.728
Here's the thing:
I care about you.

26:35.762 --> 26:39.098
- I walked up to this table
thinking, like,

26:39.131 --> 26:41.834
"We're all good."
They wanna bring up sh--.

26:41.868 --> 26:44.236
It's, like,
so what you're trying to say

26:44.270 --> 26:46.939
is you can say
whatever the f--- you want,

26:46.973 --> 26:48.875
but I can't retaliate.
- Right.

26:48.908 --> 26:50.710
- Like, I need to be
a submissive bitch.

26:50.743 --> 26:53.913
I see these bitches
for exactly what they are.

26:53.946 --> 26:55.715
I can read them like a book.

26:55.748 --> 26:58.584
The whore comments,
the slut comments.

26:58.685 --> 26:59.952
They're bullies.

26:59.986 --> 27:01.854
I'm over it.
- Dude.

27:01.888 --> 27:03.756
- I'm done.
- Lala.

27:03.790 --> 27:06.158
- No, I'm done.
- I care...

27:06.192 --> 27:08.494
- [crying] This is not
what I came here for.

27:08.527 --> 27:09.696
- That's not--dude.

27:09.696 --> 27:12.999
- This is not
what I came here for.

27:13.032 --> 27:14.734
I'm done.

27:14.767 --> 27:16.268
- Lala!

27:16.302 --> 27:18.037
- Nobody is gonna
lead by example.

27:18.070 --> 27:19.505
Nobody.
Not them, not you.

27:19.538 --> 27:20.773
Nobody is.
- If you think it's

27:20.807 --> 27:23.943
automatically,
like, where it's all good...

27:23.976 --> 27:25.277
- Katie, who do you want me
to kill?

27:25.311 --> 27:26.813
Who's f---ed with you
in your life?

27:26.846 --> 27:28.480
I'll go kill 'em right now.
- Ask anyone to kill anyone.

27:28.514 --> 27:30.082
I don't ask anyone
to have my back.

27:30.116 --> 27:31.751
I don't ask that of people
because I'm not irrational.

27:31.784 --> 27:33.252
- No, but I can't be friends
with somebody

27:33.285 --> 27:35.054
if you're not friends with 'em.
F--- you.

27:35.087 --> 27:36.455
- I even--I was--
- What have you guys done?

27:36.488 --> 27:38.557
I hate when Katie
gets like this.

27:38.590 --> 27:40.559
If you're mad at James and Lala,

27:40.592 --> 27:42.094
be mad at James and Lala,
all right?

27:42.128 --> 27:44.731
Don't try to take Tom and Ariana
down with them.

27:44.731 --> 27:45.998
- James, we'll have
to pick this up later.

27:46.032 --> 27:47.166
- James, I'll see you later,
man.

27:47.199 --> 27:49.135
- Get it together.
- Yeah.

27:49.168 --> 27:51.804
- Don't f---ing jerk off
cranberry juice in my face.

27:51.838 --> 27:53.139
- Tom broke me down tonight.
He broke me down.

27:53.172 --> 27:55.074
- Let's go.

27:55.107 --> 27:56.642
- Dude, I couldn't
deal with them.

27:56.743 --> 28:00.012
They're, like, on another level.

28:00.046 --> 28:01.948
It's not f---ing cool.

28:03.149 --> 28:04.984
- James and Lala walk in,
we see them,

28:05.017 --> 28:07.019
and it just ended up so badly.

28:07.053 --> 28:09.021
- I will talk to him
at some point.

28:09.055 --> 28:10.322
- Oh, my God.

28:10.356 --> 28:11.623
- He's running out of excuses
though.

28:16.195 --> 28:17.196
- * And we gonna drop top,
we don't cut it *

28:18.965 --> 28:20.532
- * Headlights
- * Smack that bumper

28:20.566 --> 28:22.068
both: * Bump,
bump in the trunk *

28:22.101 --> 28:23.669
- * I like
- * Engine's got the love

28:23.770 --> 28:25.337
- * Wow, oh, wow
- * Gonna take if for a ride

28:25.371 --> 28:26.906
* Put the pedal...
both: * To the metal

28:26.939 --> 28:28.674
* Can I hop inside?

28:28.775 --> 28:30.142
[Impirio, Cru, and DLFx's
"Dropp Topp"]

28:30.176 --> 28:31.778
[doorbell rings]

28:31.778 --> 28:33.079
*

28:33.112 --> 28:35.681
- You know Schnook, don't you?
- Oh, my God, yes.

28:35.782 --> 28:37.149
- Isn't he cute?
- He's getting so big.

28:37.183 --> 28:39.385
Your hair looks great.
- How are you, darling?

28:39.418 --> 28:41.253
- Oh, my God.
- Was he putting his nose

28:41.287 --> 28:42.822
up your skirt?
- Yeah.

28:42.855 --> 28:43.923
- Yeah.

28:43.956 --> 28:46.859
[playful music]

28:46.893 --> 28:50.229
Ponies, say "hello" to Katie.
You know the ponies, don't you?

28:50.262 --> 28:51.663
- So cute.

28:51.697 --> 28:52.932
- So how are you?
- [sighs]

28:52.965 --> 28:54.266
- Are you ready
to do some work for me?

28:54.300 --> 28:55.601
- I was talking with Lisa

28:55.634 --> 28:58.570
and the idea of me
being her assistant came up.

28:58.604 --> 29:00.840
I mean, I wanna learn from you.
I wanna be a business woman.

29:00.873 --> 29:03.242
- Well, yeah, I need somebody
at least one day a week.

29:03.275 --> 29:05.311
- Okay, thank you.
I'm great.

29:05.344 --> 29:07.613
No, this is gonna be good.
I'm excited.

29:07.646 --> 29:10.016
Lisa has
so many other businesses

29:10.049 --> 29:12.952
besides the restaurants
and being her assistant

29:12.985 --> 29:15.687
would be an opportunity
for Lisa to see me

29:15.721 --> 29:17.056
in a different light.

29:17.089 --> 29:19.358
- I mean, there's just
so much going on.

29:19.391 --> 29:21.527
Pump and Sur.

29:21.560 --> 29:23.395
we've got World Dog Day
coming up.

29:23.429 --> 29:25.031
I could actually do
with some help.

29:25.064 --> 29:28.868
Let's say I'll--I'll pay you
say $30 and hour,

29:28.901 --> 29:31.838
and let's start with you working
say six hours a day,

29:31.838 --> 29:33.840
so you're not overwhelmed.
- Yeah, that's manageable.

29:33.840 --> 29:35.207
- Okay.
- That's, like, a shift

29:35.241 --> 29:36.976
at the restaurant.
I can do that.

29:37.009 --> 29:40.246
- I never have assistants.
I'd rather do it all myself,

29:40.279 --> 29:42.281
but I've known Katie
for seven or eight years,

29:42.314 --> 29:45.084
and she really has been
an exemplary employee,

29:45.117 --> 29:48.220
and Katie can, I think,
really help me.

29:48.254 --> 29:49.588
So what else is going on?

29:49.621 --> 29:51.523
- Do you know about last night?
- No, I don't know.

29:51.557 --> 29:52.992
What happened last night?

29:53.025 --> 29:56.262
- Oh, my God, we went
to the "OK! Magazine" party

29:56.295 --> 29:57.696
at Skybar at the Mondrian,

29:57.729 --> 30:00.532
and James and Lala walk in,
we see them,

30:00.566 --> 30:02.201
and the first word
out of Lala's mouth, she's like,

30:02.234 --> 30:04.503
"Mm, I see you've been working
on your summer body."

30:04.536 --> 30:06.005
[dramatic music]

30:06.038 --> 30:07.406
James is like,
"Yeah, when are you expecting?"

30:07.439 --> 30:09.508
Like, basically just
body-shaming me to my face.

30:09.541 --> 30:10.709
Calling me fat, in other words.

30:10.742 --> 30:12.611
- Who?
Lala?

30:12.644 --> 30:15.081
- Her boyfriend has
a wife and kids, so...

30:15.114 --> 30:16.916
In my opinion, you can't really
call a man that's--

30:16.949 --> 30:19.285
has wife and kids,
um, your boyfriend.

30:19.318 --> 30:20.419
- This is gossip,

30:20.452 --> 30:22.221
and gossip
I can't be involved in.

30:22.254 --> 30:23.956
- She is repulsive
and despicable,

30:23.990 --> 30:25.524
and she's a horrible
human being,

30:25.557 --> 30:27.359
and that's fine.
We don't need to be friends...

30:27.393 --> 30:28.727
- Okay.
No, you don't have to be.

30:28.760 --> 30:30.863
- But James starts, like--
takes his drink,

30:30.897 --> 30:32.631
and motioning,
like, jerking off like this,

30:32.664 --> 30:34.967
and, like, spraying
and spilling his drink,

30:35.001 --> 30:38.270
like, all over our table.
It just ended up...

30:38.304 --> 30:39.805
so badly.
You know, I...

30:39.838 --> 30:42.074
[exhales]
- He's just creating a problem.

30:42.108 --> 30:44.676
I will talk to him
at some point.

30:44.710 --> 30:47.213
I can only make
so many allowances for James.

30:47.246 --> 30:49.215
I mean, to go out
and call Katie fat

30:49.248 --> 30:50.849
and act like
a little asshole

30:50.883 --> 30:53.953
is not what I had in mind
for him at all.

30:53.986 --> 30:56.055
I mean, I have made
a lot of allowances

30:56.088 --> 30:57.789
because...

30:57.823 --> 30:59.058
of his parents,

30:59.091 --> 31:01.360
and because he's been
so close to Max,

31:01.393 --> 31:03.195
but he's pushing boundaries.

31:03.229 --> 31:04.496
He's running out of excuses
though.

31:04.530 --> 31:06.632
That's for sure.

31:06.665 --> 31:11.770
- * You gon' need a ladder
just to get up to my level *

31:11.803 --> 31:14.006
[pop music]

31:14.040 --> 31:18.644
* You gon' need a ladder
just to get up to my level *

31:18.677 --> 31:21.380
- Hey, did you pay rent,
by the way?

31:21.413 --> 31:23.782
- Yeah.
- All right.

31:23.815 --> 31:25.651
- We need the hammer so we can
take all these nails out.

31:25.684 --> 31:26.818
We're gonna have so many holes.
- Where is the ham--

31:26.852 --> 31:29.521
where's the hammer?
- In the kitchen.

31:29.555 --> 31:31.490
We're gonna have
so many holes in here.

31:31.523 --> 31:32.959
- All the restaurants
in Hollywood,

31:32.959 --> 31:34.260
you had to pick Sur.

31:34.293 --> 31:37.196
You're not gonna work in
the lounge part at all, are you?

31:37.229 --> 31:39.531
Are you?
- Uh, I don't know.

31:39.565 --> 31:41.800
- Last summer, Brittany and I
were living in this studio

31:41.833 --> 31:43.169
that we were
driving each other crazy.

31:43.202 --> 31:45.404
We're on top of each other.
I'm a clean freak,

31:45.437 --> 31:47.539
and I hate what it looks like
in that closet.

31:47.573 --> 31:49.308
- There's not enough space
to put my clothes.

31:49.341 --> 31:50.977
- [stammers]
I know that.

31:50.977 --> 31:53.512
This summer, we've moved
into this beautiful apartment.

31:53.545 --> 31:55.481
It's definitely relieved
so much pressure,

31:55.514 --> 31:56.983
the fact that we're
in a bigger place.

31:57.016 --> 31:58.650
You know, you--
you need your space.

31:58.684 --> 32:00.186
I should call
and see how Tom's doing.

32:00.219 --> 32:02.121
He was a mess last night.

32:02.154 --> 32:05.157
James and Lala just
running their mouths and--

32:05.191 --> 32:07.093
- Why did they even
walk over to the table

32:07.126 --> 32:08.860
is what I'm confused about.
- I'm gonna beat

32:08.894 --> 32:10.096
the ever-loving sh--
out of that kid.

32:10.129 --> 32:11.998
I swear to God,
and I--I've never

32:11.998 --> 32:13.565
had so much hate
towards somebody.

32:13.599 --> 32:15.034
You're doing a really good job.

32:15.067 --> 32:16.635
- [laughs]
- [chuckles]

32:16.668 --> 32:18.570
- Do you like looking at my butt
while I do it?

32:18.604 --> 32:21.107
- Yeah, my face was
all up in there last night.

32:21.140 --> 32:22.508
You were eating muff
like no other.

32:22.541 --> 32:23.842
- Oh, gross.
- Not you.

32:23.875 --> 32:25.211
I'm sorry, Kristen was eating--
- No, she was not.

32:25.244 --> 32:26.412
Stop.
I swear to God,

32:26.445 --> 32:28.147
I'm gonna punch you.
- I saw what I saw.

32:28.180 --> 32:29.381
- Okay, well, don't--
you didn't see sh--,

32:29.415 --> 32:31.150
so don--stop.

32:31.183 --> 32:32.884
- If I f---ed up,
Brittany would be all over that

32:32.918 --> 32:34.486
with all her girlfriends.
You know?

32:34.520 --> 32:35.687
But, I guess,
if she does something

32:35.721 --> 32:36.822
that I'm weirded out by

32:36.855 --> 32:38.624
I just gotta keep my mouth shut.

32:38.657 --> 32:40.726
I ran to Tom and I ta--
told him what happened,

32:40.759 --> 32:42.628
and Tom may have
told other people,

32:42.661 --> 32:44.096
so that's why it
kind of got out last night.

32:44.130 --> 32:45.531
They were talking about it.
- Yeah, and that's stupid.

32:45.564 --> 32:47.099
Like, my own boyfriend
starts rumors about me.

32:47.133 --> 32:48.267
That's so stupid.
- I'm not starting a rumor.

32:48.300 --> 32:49.701
I was upset.

32:49.735 --> 32:52.138
- I mean, I've kissed girls,
like, drunk,

32:52.171 --> 32:54.306
but Kristen and I
did not hook up.

32:54.340 --> 32:56.075
She did not "go down on me."

32:56.108 --> 32:58.044
I cannot make this
anymore clear.

32:58.077 --> 33:01.113
I am strictly dickly.

33:01.147 --> 33:02.481
That's not okay.
- I mean, I'm not

33:02.514 --> 33:03.915
mad about it anymore because
now I've thought about it.

33:03.949 --> 33:05.417
- [stammers]
- It's not a big deal.

33:05.451 --> 33:07.619
- I know, but it's stupid
that it's even being brought up.

33:07.653 --> 33:09.055
It should not even
be talked about.

33:09.055 --> 33:10.889
This is the stupidest thing
I've ever heard.

33:10.922 --> 33:12.491
Nothing happened,
and you're pissing me off

33:12.524 --> 33:13.825
by sa--talking about it.
- Okay.

33:13.859 --> 33:15.161
All right,
we'll leave it at that.

33:15.194 --> 33:16.595
- You're gonna make me
really mad.

33:16.628 --> 33:17.763
- All right, okay.
- And I don't wanna

33:17.796 --> 33:20.499
ever hear about it again
or I will go insane.

33:20.532 --> 33:22.068
- [exhales]
- I not kidding.

33:22.068 --> 33:24.570
I changed my entire life
for Jax.

33:24.603 --> 33:27.606
I moved from Kentucky.
Moved in with him.

33:27.639 --> 33:30.909
Like, basically,
am doing everything for him,

33:30.942 --> 33:34.480
and if Jax doesn't shut
his f---ing mouth,

33:34.513 --> 33:37.549
I'm gonna move back to Kentucky
and end this relationship.

33:37.583 --> 33:38.950
You're pissing me off.
- I mean, I'm not opposed

33:38.984 --> 33:40.486
for you doing it again.
I'm just saying.

33:40.519 --> 33:41.620
- What?
- I'm just kidding.

33:41.653 --> 33:42.788
I'm joking.
- That's not funny.

33:42.821 --> 33:44.090
- I won't do--all right,
that was the last one.

33:44.090 --> 33:45.657
- Not funny.
- okay.

33:45.691 --> 33:47.293
- Are you almost done yet?
I'm hungry.

33:47.326 --> 33:48.994
- Shut up.

33:50.962 --> 33:52.331
- I feel like
they only have access

33:52.364 --> 33:53.999
to, like 5% of their brain.

33:54.100 --> 33:55.967
- Her head is so far
up her own ass.

34:01.473 --> 34:01.907
[electronic music]

34:03.775 --> 34:06.445
- * Oh-oh-oh-oh

34:06.478 --> 34:07.446
*

34:07.479 --> 34:10.015
* Hey, la, la, la

34:10.116 --> 34:12.184
*

34:12.218 --> 34:13.885
- Listen, even if things
don't work out between us,

34:13.919 --> 34:15.487
we kind of, like,
have to stay together

34:15.521 --> 34:17.423
We've got the dogs.
We've got the apartment.

34:17.456 --> 34:19.225
Like...
- I got the ring.

34:19.258 --> 34:20.759
- You've got the ring.
- We've got a date

34:20.792 --> 34:22.394
to get married, so why don't you
not talk like that.

34:22.428 --> 34:24.130
- Oh, sh--.
There's that too.

34:24.130 --> 34:26.732
- I wouldn't say
so much has changed

34:26.765 --> 34:29.268
in Tom and I's relationship
since we've gotten engaged...

34:29.301 --> 34:30.802
[upbeat music]

34:30.836 --> 34:32.138
[squeals]

34:32.138 --> 34:33.572
- Will you marry me?

34:33.605 --> 34:34.906
- Of course!

34:34.940 --> 34:36.742
You know, got a new apartment.

34:36.775 --> 34:39.578
We got a new member
of our family, Butter,

34:39.611 --> 34:42.748
so we're getting the taste
of, uh, living an adult life

34:42.781 --> 34:45.584
and a little--
shall I say, parenthood.

34:45.617 --> 34:46.885
- When are the girls
coming over?

34:46.918 --> 34:48.154
- Um, probably any minute.
- You guys aren't gonna

34:48.187 --> 34:49.888
get rowdy are you?
- No, everyone, I think,

34:49.921 --> 34:51.022
is pretty dead.

34:51.056 --> 34:52.324
- You guys are gonna
talk so much.

34:52.358 --> 34:54.326
You guys are gonna yap
your mother----ing traps off.

34:54.360 --> 34:55.861
- [laughs softly]
What did you just say?

34:55.894 --> 34:57.596
- I don't know.
Do I go hermit mode

34:57.629 --> 34:58.730
or do I be social?

34:58.764 --> 35:00.766
- You be social.

35:00.799 --> 35:02.634
[knocks on door]

35:02.668 --> 35:04.803
- Come in.

35:04.836 --> 35:07.173
- Hey.
- Hi.

35:07.173 --> 35:09.074
Ooh.
all: Hi.

35:09.175 --> 35:10.609
- I brought you dinner.
- Hi, Butter.

35:10.642 --> 35:12.444
- Oh, my God, yummy.
- Hi, Gordo.

35:12.478 --> 35:13.679
- Gluten-free Bolognese.
- Oh, it's, like warm still.

35:13.712 --> 35:16.415
- You guys, happy
first wedding conversation.

35:16.448 --> 35:19.050
- Whoa, whoa, we're doing
wedding conversations?

35:19.084 --> 35:20.752
- It's gonna be a festive night.

35:20.786 --> 35:22.521
I made something for you guys.

35:22.554 --> 35:24.490
- Can I see?
- Yeah, okay.

35:24.523 --> 35:26.057
We all have special cups.

35:26.091 --> 35:28.527
One's for Katie.
It's the special, special one.

35:28.560 --> 35:30.529
- Did you make it?
- Yeah.

35:30.562 --> 35:32.698
Cute.
- This one is for Scheana.

35:32.731 --> 35:34.966
- Wait, you bedazzled that?
- F---, yeah, I did.

35:35.000 --> 35:36.602
So this is what we're gonna do.

35:36.635 --> 35:38.337
It's not gonna be
a normal wine night, okay?

35:38.370 --> 35:40.839
- Okay.
- I Pinterested

35:40.872 --> 35:43.442
festive bridal cocktails.

35:43.475 --> 35:45.577
- I wasn't gonna drink tonight,
but in honor of--

35:45.611 --> 35:46.878
I feel--I don't wanna be lame.

35:46.912 --> 35:48.214
- Yeah, I don't want you
to be lame either.

35:48.214 --> 35:50.382
- I'm kinda hungover.
- There's a finger hole.

35:50.416 --> 35:52.117
- Well, I guess
we should all have one.

35:52.218 --> 35:55.287
I'm so excited
for Katie to get married

35:55.321 --> 35:58.824
'cause I really want to be
a part of this day for her.

35:58.857 --> 36:00.392
I mean,
if she wants to put me to work

36:00.426 --> 36:01.627
and not have me
be a bridesmaid,

36:01.660 --> 36:03.395
then I'll still do that for her,

36:03.429 --> 36:05.764
but I really wanna be
a f---ing bridesmaid.

36:05.797 --> 36:07.065
[doorbell rings,
knock at door]

36:07.098 --> 36:09.568
- Come in.
- Hi.

36:09.601 --> 36:13.038
- I have pretty much
nothing planned wedding-wise.

36:13.071 --> 36:15.241
Obviously, I have my dress,

36:15.241 --> 36:17.609
and then I wanna look at--

36:17.643 --> 36:21.580
now I'm thinking all emerald
or all, like, creams.

36:21.613 --> 36:22.881
- The same dress?
- Ooh.

36:22.914 --> 36:24.250
- I mean, people have
different body types.

36:24.250 --> 36:25.484
Everyone's, like, tall.

36:25.517 --> 36:27.085
- You guys have
your winter bodies.

36:27.118 --> 36:28.987
- I have my winter body,
so I don't know

36:29.020 --> 36:30.589
what dress I'm gonna fit in.
[all laugh]

36:30.622 --> 36:32.491
- Oh, last night?
I thought it was a bad dream.

36:32.524 --> 36:33.892
- Literally.

36:33.925 --> 36:36.395
- Like, even when I accidentally
sh-- my pants one time,

36:36.428 --> 36:38.129
that wasn't even
as embarrassing as that.

36:38.163 --> 36:39.331
- Yeah.
- Like, seriously.

36:39.365 --> 36:41.367
[all laugh]
I thought I was just gonna

36:41.400 --> 36:42.934
let out some gas,

36:42.968 --> 36:46.638
and all of the sudden
it didn't feel like that.

36:46.672 --> 36:51.377
It felt, like, a lot more,
like, wet and weird.

36:51.410 --> 36:52.978
- I sh-- my pants one time too.
- Oh, my God.

36:53.011 --> 36:54.280
[both laugh]

36:54.280 --> 36:57.283
[electronic music]

36:57.283 --> 37:02.554
*

37:02.588 --> 37:04.590
- Hi, puppy.

37:04.623 --> 37:07.025
- Hey.

37:07.058 --> 37:09.295
- How you feeling today?

37:09.328 --> 37:11.497
- Ugh, to be honest, I was
a little hungover this morning,

37:11.530 --> 37:12.964
but I feel good now.

37:12.998 --> 37:15.166
- We need to start being a
healthy influence on each other

37:15.200 --> 37:17.503
because what happened last night
was not okay.

37:17.536 --> 37:19.104
- I'm not gonna sit here
and bullsh--.

37:19.137 --> 37:20.939
Like, all of them
and being like,

37:20.972 --> 37:22.341
"Oh, my God,
I should be so sorry."

37:22.374 --> 37:24.343
Obviously, I had
too much to drink last night.

37:24.376 --> 37:26.077
I told Katie
to lose some pounds,

37:26.111 --> 37:28.013
and I cried about Tom--
about my dad.

37:28.046 --> 37:29.348
It's simple.

37:29.381 --> 37:32.050
- I don't care if his dad
moved back to England.

37:32.083 --> 37:33.352
I don't care
if his parents are divorced.

37:33.385 --> 37:34.753
We've all been there.
- Oh, yeah,

37:34.786 --> 37:36.322
if I hear one person say, like,
"He's going through

37:36.322 --> 37:37.389
a really hard time.
- You're, like,

37:37.423 --> 37:39.124
two years older than Lala.
- I know.

37:39.157 --> 37:40.726
- Like, really?
Like, she acts like

37:40.759 --> 37:42.694
we're in our 40s and they're,
like, in their early 20s.

37:42.728 --> 37:44.062
Guys, they're, like, old.

37:44.095 --> 37:46.197
- With Scheana,
I think she's a dumb bitch,

37:46.231 --> 37:48.233
who doesn't know how to take
accountability for anything.

37:48.334 --> 37:50.235
Her head is so far
up her own ass.

37:50.336 --> 37:52.471
Like, she is so into herself

37:52.504 --> 37:55.574
that she had to marry a dude
who just never f---ing talks

37:55.607 --> 37:57.676
so that she's the always on top.
It's so annoying.

37:57.709 --> 37:59.411
I think it's so cute
when Scheana comes up

37:59.445 --> 38:00.812
and thinks that anyone
gives a f---

38:00.846 --> 38:02.581
about what she says.

38:02.614 --> 38:04.716
Like, next.
Bitch, please.

38:04.750 --> 38:06.352
- I avoid Sur on Wednesdays.
- Yeah.

38:06.352 --> 38:08.387
- I avoid Pump all together now
for the most part

38:08.420 --> 38:10.522
because, I swear to God,
he's just always there...

38:10.556 --> 38:12.358
- Yeah.
- Getting sh--faced.

38:12.358 --> 38:15.026
- With Kristen, I actually--
she's the bitch that I'm like,

38:15.060 --> 38:17.563
"At least this ho knows
that she's crazy," right?

38:17.596 --> 38:20.532
- James is gonna provoke Jax
as much as he can

38:20.566 --> 38:21.700
until Jax punches him.
- But why?

38:21.733 --> 38:22.868
But why?
- Because he thinks it's funny.

38:22.901 --> 38:23.935
He gets off on doing it.

38:23.969 --> 38:25.170
I feel like
they only have access

38:25.203 --> 38:26.772
to, like, 5% of their brains.

38:26.805 --> 38:28.139
- And then Stassi.

38:28.173 --> 38:30.476
I'm sorry,
I think she's a bitch.

38:30.509 --> 38:32.177
Everything about her face,

38:32.210 --> 38:33.812
that smile?
Schemer.

38:33.845 --> 38:35.547
Schemer as f---.
- See, I think she's hot,

38:35.581 --> 38:37.148
and I don't usually like blonds.
- I don't think she's hot.

38:37.182 --> 38:39.451
- From the moment I met her,
I did give her a chance.

38:39.485 --> 38:40.786
I did try with her.

38:40.819 --> 38:42.954
That I was exactly right
about her.

38:42.988 --> 38:44.756
- I see the girls,

38:44.790 --> 38:46.091
and I'm happy that
they're all friends again,

38:46.124 --> 38:48.193
but it makes me wonder
if it was a good idea

38:48.226 --> 38:51.129
to encourage Katie
to forgive Stassi.

38:51.162 --> 38:53.765
I mean, I see them falling back
into their own ways,

38:53.799 --> 38:56.968
and sometimes they kind of help
bring out that inner mean girl.

38:57.002 --> 38:58.504
- She's actually worse
than what you even...

38:58.537 --> 39:00.138
- Yeah, yeah, actually, yeah.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

39:00.171 --> 39:02.641
- And then f---ing Katie
is just a worthless blob.

39:02.674 --> 39:04.410
It's like,
"Bitch, go back to the days

39:04.410 --> 39:06.011
where you just thought
what everyone else thought

39:06.044 --> 39:07.178
'cause you're not appealing.

39:07.212 --> 39:09.848
I call Katie "The Blob,"

39:09.881 --> 39:13.719
and I know it's f---ed up,
but she's just blobbish.

39:13.752 --> 39:15.421
- I'm sorry, honey,
but you're gonna be 30

39:15.421 --> 39:16.988
before you f---ing know it,

39:17.022 --> 39:18.657
and--but what's wrong
with people being old?

39:18.690 --> 39:20.992
Don't you, like, f---ing sit
on old d---s all day long?

39:21.026 --> 39:23.529
- Oh, drop the mic, Maloney.
[all laugh]

39:23.562 --> 39:25.964
- Damn, son.
This is a haters' ball.

39:25.997 --> 39:28.434
You guys--it's always
a haters' ball with you guys.

39:28.434 --> 39:29.568
[all laugh]
both: Yeah.

39:29.601 --> 39:31.437
- You're one of us.
You're one of us.

39:31.470 --> 39:32.838
- [laughs]
- Mm, what's happening?

39:32.871 --> 39:34.573
What have you guys done to me?

39:34.606 --> 39:36.241
I'm not part of--
I'm not one of you.

39:36.274 --> 39:37.643
- Welcome to the dark side,
mother----er.

39:37.676 --> 39:39.778
- Own it.
- [chuckles] I don't like it.

39:40.912 --> 39:42.881
- Really, James?
You're being a little bitch.

39:42.914 --> 39:44.483
- Look--
- And there's only so many times

39:49.888 --> 39:50.722
- * Mm, you got me
feelin' like *

39:52.357 --> 39:53.559
- * Ooh-ooh
ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh *

39:53.592 --> 39:55.360
* Ooh-ooh-ooh
ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh *

39:55.461 --> 39:56.828
- * You got me feelin' like

39:56.862 --> 39:58.497
- * Ooh-ooh
ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh *

39:58.530 --> 40:00.098
* Ooh-ooh-ooh
ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh *

40:00.131 --> 40:01.467
- * You got me feelin' like

40:01.500 --> 40:03.001
[Jonathan Murrill's
"Got Me feeling Like"]

40:03.034 --> 40:04.335
- How's everything going?
- Everything's good.

40:04.369 --> 40:05.971
We got a lot of covers tonight.
I think we're over,

40:06.004 --> 40:07.238
like, 220 for covers.

40:07.272 --> 40:09.340
- I need to speak to James.

40:09.374 --> 40:11.109
I'm gonna be over there.
Send him over there.

40:11.142 --> 40:12.343
I wanna have
a quick chat with him.

40:12.377 --> 40:13.512
- Absolutely.

40:13.545 --> 40:15.246
- I can be kind
and sympathetic to James

40:15.280 --> 40:16.915
until it affects my business,

40:16.948 --> 40:19.551
and when he's going around
insulting these other girls,

40:19.585 --> 40:21.019
that's not conducive

40:21.052 --> 40:23.021
to a harmonious atmosphere
at work.

40:23.054 --> 40:25.023
- Hello.

40:25.056 --> 40:27.425
- How are you doing?
- Pretty good.

40:27.459 --> 40:30.128
- So what happened last night?

40:30.161 --> 40:31.262
[dramatic music]

40:31.296 --> 40:32.464
- What do you mean?
- No, but I--well, look,

40:32.498 --> 40:33.899
you went to the party,

40:33.932 --> 40:37.068
you literally go to their table,
you kind of insert yourself

40:37.102 --> 40:39.237
right in the middle of it.
- I walked up to the table

40:39.270 --> 40:40.739
and I said, "Hey, guys.
How are you?"

40:40.772 --> 40:43.575
I tried to shake everyone's hand
and it was, like, a no-go.

40:43.609 --> 40:46.612
So, instantly excluded
from the group.

40:46.645 --> 40:48.647
Like--
- Do you expect me to believe

40:48.680 --> 40:51.717
you're innocent in this?
'Cause I don't.

40:51.750 --> 40:53.251
- Lisa, honestly,
at the end of the day,

40:53.284 --> 40:54.586
what happens is, like,

40:54.620 --> 40:56.488
I'm compelled to be an asshole
sometimes to them

40:56.522 --> 40:59.891
because they love
to see me crumble,

40:59.925 --> 41:01.326
you know, and--
- Well, you give them

41:01.359 --> 41:03.094
every reason, James.
- Every reason?

41:03.128 --> 41:04.763
- Just stand on the sidelines...
- Well, you know, quite frankly,

41:04.796 --> 41:06.532
I don't care
if they don't like me.

41:06.532 --> 41:10.368
- I think James seeks
approval and acceptance

41:10.401 --> 41:13.171
and when he doesn't get it,
then he just lashes out.

41:13.204 --> 41:15.674
I don't know
if he understands that

41:15.707 --> 41:19.110
there are boundaries in life,
and he constantly them.

41:19.144 --> 41:20.245
You know what?

41:20.278 --> 41:22.047
You say you don't care
about these people,

41:22.080 --> 41:24.916
you say that, but yet,
you want to walk into a party

41:24.950 --> 41:26.585
and then you want
to immerse yourself

41:26.618 --> 41:27.753
right in the middle of them,

41:27.786 --> 41:28.920
and yet you don't care
about them.

41:28.954 --> 41:31.422
That doesn't make sense to me.

41:31.456 --> 41:33.725
Really, James?

41:33.759 --> 41:34.960
You're being a little bitch

41:34.993 --> 41:38.229
and you're trying
to get a rise out of everybody.

41:38.263 --> 41:39.598
*

41:39.631 --> 41:41.700
- Sometimes I like getting
a rise out of these people.

41:41.733 --> 41:43.034
Just to let them know
I'm still there.

41:43.068 --> 41:44.636
- Yeah, exactly.
That's exactly what you do,

41:44.670 --> 41:46.938
and you've gotta stop.
Okay?

41:46.972 --> 41:49.474
How do you expect me
to put you back in Sur

41:49.575 --> 41:50.642
and work with all of them

41:50.676 --> 41:52.811
when you're acting
like a little asshole.

41:52.844 --> 41:56.381
I sometimes think that
James tries to take advantage

41:56.414 --> 41:58.449
of our kindness to him, really,

41:58.483 --> 42:01.086
and most bosses aren't gonna be
emotionally supportive.

42:01.119 --> 42:04.122
It's either shape up
or ship the f--- out.

42:04.155 --> 42:06.391
It's getting difficult

42:06.424 --> 42:08.159
for me to defend your actions.

42:08.193 --> 42:10.395
I keep making excuses for you...
- No--

42:10.428 --> 42:13.732
- And there's only so many times
I can defend you.

42:13.765 --> 42:15.901
*

42:15.934 --> 42:18.136
Next time
on "Vanderpump Rules"...

42:18.169 --> 42:20.105
- I just wanna take a minute
and say sorry.

42:20.138 --> 42:22.407
- I just think you're,
like, a horrible person.

42:22.440 --> 42:25.677
- I feel like I'm turning into
a very, like, vicious person.

42:25.711 --> 42:27.679
- And that's not you at all.
- No.

42:27.713 --> 42:30.015
- Before we get married,
I think we should probably

42:30.048 --> 42:31.416
get a prenup.

42:31.449 --> 42:34.085
It's not an expression of doubt
at all.

42:34.119 --> 42:36.287
- Jax walked in on Kristen

42:36.321 --> 42:38.089
going down on Brittany.

42:38.123 --> 42:39.791
- You f---ing lied.
- It is my problem.

42:39.825 --> 42:42.093
- Stop f---ing people over
that care about you.

42:42.127 --> 42:43.629
- I just didn't think
he would do this to me.

42:43.662 --> 42:44.730
- You know what?
You're upset about it.

42:44.763 --> 42:46.231
So stay strong.

42:46.264 --> 42:48.466
- What do I get out of lying
about something that's som--

42:48.499 --> 42:50.235
- Why did you say it?
- Because it happened!

42:50.268 --> 42:52.370
- It didn't happen!
- Oh, my God, I think I'm crazy.

42:52.403 --> 42:54.706
I must be crazy.
Nobody's hearing this.

42:54.740 --> 42:56.241
