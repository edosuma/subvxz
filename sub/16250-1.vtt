JONATHAN: America has produced
only three classic writers,

00:34.702 --> 00:38.121
Mark Twain, J.D. Salinger, and me.

00:40.040 --> 00:42.083
I'm Jonathan Flynn.

00:42.167 --> 00:44.627
Everything I write is a masterpiece.

00:45.379 --> 00:48.172
And soon, very soon,

00:49.007 --> 00:50.883
I shall be known.

00:56.598 --> 00:59.892
At this point of the story,
let's call it the present,

00:59.977 --> 01:03.730
I am an upstanding citizen
of these United States.

01:03.814 --> 01:05.773
I have a job,

01:05.983 --> 01:09.694
a roof over my head. I have sustenance.

01:12.197 --> 01:14.782
Perhaps I'll let you read
my masterpiece someday.

01:15.033 --> 01:18.536
The Button Man, also known as The
Confessions of Christopher Cobb.

01:18.620 --> 01:20.121
It's classic.

01:25.210 --> 01:26.627
NICK: This isn't his story.

01:26.712 --> 01:30.089
Well, it is, but he is not telling it,

01:30.924 --> 01:32.133
I am.

01:34.636 --> 01:38.681
I'm Nick Flynn, his son, and I am
sort of trying to be a writer.

01:42.019 --> 01:43.936
I mean, not at this very moment.

01:44.021 --> 01:45.438
At this moment I'm trying to...

01:45.522 --> 01:46.814
Wake up.

01:47.357 --> 01:48.441
(CLEARS THROAT)

01:49.193 --> 01:51.068
Hey, wake up.

01:58.577 --> 02:02.663
All my life, my father has been
manifest as an absence.

02:02.748 --> 02:05.875
A non-presence. A name without a body.

02:05.959 --> 02:07.126
What if he doesn't show up?

02:07.211 --> 02:08.669
He's gonna show up.

02:08.753 --> 02:10.045
How do you know?

02:10.130 --> 02:12.673
Because if he doesn't show up this time,

02:12.758 --> 02:14.634
I'm going to kill him.

02:15.052 --> 02:16.928
How will you find him to kill him?

02:18.430 --> 02:20.223
I have ways.

02:22.810 --> 02:25.353
Can we get ice cream if
he doesn't show up?

02:26.605 --> 02:28.523
Here is the bus. Here he is.

02:33.111 --> 02:34.612
JODY: No, that is not him.

02:35.405 --> 02:36.948
He must be in the back.

03:03.934 --> 03:05.268
What kind of ice cream do you want to get?

03:05.394 --> 03:06.727
Chocolate.

03:07.604 --> 03:10.398
NICK: Some part of me knew
he would show up someday.

03:10.482 --> 03:13.901
If I stayed in one place long
enough, he would find me,

03:13.986 --> 03:17.154
like you are taught to
do when you are lost.

03:17.239 --> 03:18.906
But what do you do if both of you are lost

03:18.991 --> 03:21.576
and you both end up in the
same place, waiting?

03:36.300 --> 03:37.550
Hey, sweetie.

03:37.634 --> 03:38.926
Hey.

03:42.347 --> 03:43.681
I'm exhausted.

03:43.765 --> 03:44.765
How was your flight?

03:44.850 --> 03:46.225
Non-stop turbulence.

03:47.352 --> 03:49.103
Nick, what is the ashtray
doing by the bed?

03:50.731 --> 03:51.939
Sorry.

03:54.151 --> 03:55.151
Lipstick?

03:58.363 --> 04:00.406
You are a fucking asshole.

04:02.242 --> 04:04.911
Look, you are the one who said you
didn't see a future for us.

04:04.995 --> 04:07.163
I wonder why? This is yours!

04:08.749 --> 04:09.916
This is yours.

04:10.000 --> 04:11.751

Oh, more Yates. All right.

Wow! You are so well-read.

04:19.426 --> 04:21.344

(CHUCKLES)

13:54.834 --> 13:56.001
(DOOR OPENING)

13:56.419 --> 13:58.921
Well? Gonna come in?

14:08.014 --> 14:10.891
Pleasure to see you, Nicholas,
aside from the circumstances.

14:10.975 --> 14:12.267
NICK: What are the circumstances?

14:12.352 --> 14:13.685
The circumstances are

14:13.770 --> 14:16.855
that I had a disagreement with
my scum-sucking landlord.

14:17.607 --> 14:19.525
I don't know why.

14:19.609 --> 14:21.610
And so he decided to bring the
police into the discussion.

14:21.945 --> 14:23.070
So now I'm forced to move.

14:23.238 --> 14:24.488
Move where?

14:25.281 --> 14:27.950
I'm considering my options. I'm
a sought-after house guest.

14:28.034 --> 14:29.076
You know why?

14:29.953 --> 14:30.994
No.

14:31.079 --> 14:32.788
Because I'm an excellent raconteur.

14:34.165 --> 14:35.499
But until I find a new place,

14:35.583 --> 14:37.042
I have to put all my things in storage.

14:37.126 --> 14:38.627
Hey. So I'm not bringing
the gun in my truck.

14:39.295 --> 14:40.879
What? The shotgun.

14:40.964 --> 14:41.964
Shotgun?

14:42.048 --> 14:43.090
Uh, yeah. You said you had a shotgun.

14:43.174 --> 14:45.300
A shotgun? Who said that?
I abhor firearms.

14:45.552 --> 14:48.011
I mean, don't get me wrong,
I can defend myself.

14:48.137 --> 14:49.471
Let me just...

14:55.937 --> 14:57.354
You see this? Yes.

14:57.522 --> 14:59.022
Anyone messes with me when I'm driving

14:59.107 --> 15:00.566
or walking down the street, whatever.

15:00.775 --> 15:03.235
Bamo! Right in the head. It sends a
little message, let me tell you.

15:03.695 --> 15:04.945
I'd like to take that scumbag landlord,

15:05.029 --> 15:06.822
and I'd like to ram it right up his ass.

15:07.156 --> 15:09.866
This landlord, this merchant,
this fucking user...

15:09.951 --> 15:12.160
Hey, that is great. Would you
mind putting that away?

15:12.328 --> 15:13.662
I'd like to take this and...

15:13.746 --> 15:15.414
Please? ...ram it up his fucking ass,

15:15.498 --> 15:17.499
twist it around, pull it down,

15:17.625 --> 15:21.086
rip out his innards and
fucking pull them out.

15:21.170 --> 15:23.171
You get the fucking picture.

15:29.470 --> 15:31.680
That was my first wife, Jody.

15:33.558 --> 15:35.726
I know who it is. She was my mother.

15:35.810 --> 15:37.227
I know she was your mother.

15:37.645 --> 15:39.688
She was the most beautiful
woman in the world.

15:39.772 --> 15:41.356
She was the love of my life.

15:41.441 --> 15:42.899
She was the light of my love.

15:44.986 --> 15:48.530
I know if she was still alive
today, we'd be together.

15:49.949 --> 15:51.992
Such a tragic accident.

15:52.076 --> 15:54.202
What accident?

15:54.287 --> 15:56.663
The accident that cut her life short.

15:56.873 --> 15:59.750
It wasn't an accident. She left a note.

16:00.877 --> 16:02.878
Did it mention me?

16:04.505 --> 16:05.839
No.

16:06.883 --> 16:07.883
Ah.

16:07.967 --> 16:09.343
Not much of a letter writer, your mother.

16:11.262 --> 16:13.138
All right, Nicholas. Why
don't we get started.

16:14.682 --> 16:17.851
You can just take all this stuff
and throw it in a box.

16:17.935 --> 16:19.144
The paintings be careful of.

16:19.228 --> 16:21.063
Especially this one and that one,
and that one on the wall.

16:21.314 --> 16:24.566
Be careful of all this stuff.
It's all valuable.

16:25.526 --> 16:27.653
Nicholas, I want you to have this.

16:27.779 --> 16:29.905
This is an original Jackson Pollock.

16:29.989 --> 16:31.573
He was a friend.

16:31.658 --> 16:32.949
Oh, no. I couldn't.

16:33.034 --> 16:34.701
No, I want you to have it.

16:34.786 --> 16:36.745
Okay, thanks.

16:36.829 --> 16:38.538
Are you going to help move this
stuff, since it's yours?

16:38.623 --> 16:42.417
I wish I could, but I suffer from
lethal phlebitis in both legs.

16:42.502 --> 16:44.628
You be careful with those boxes.
There's manuscripts.

16:46.673 --> 16:48.882
Manuscripts.

16:49.050 --> 16:50.467
Those are your friends?

16:51.094 --> 16:52.177
I guess. Yeah.

16:52.261 --> 16:54.179
A homosexual and a black pothead?

16:54.263 --> 16:56.056
Well, good luck to you.

16:56.140 --> 16:58.183
Well, I have to get to work now.

16:58.267 --> 17:00.811
Do you mind just locking the padlock
when you're finished?

17:00.895 --> 17:02.688
Yeah. Wait. So you drive a taxi?

17:02.772 --> 17:04.189
Well, it's an excellent way of learning

17:04.272 --> 17:05.816
about all different kinds of people.

17:05.942 --> 17:07.233
And what is your vocation?

17:07.318 --> 17:09.111
My vocation? Uh...

17:09.444 --> 17:10.737
I've done lots of different jobs.

17:10.946 --> 17:13.115
I always thought you'd end up
a writer, like your old man.

17:13.199 --> 17:16.201
Actually, I do write. You
know, sometimes. I try.

17:16.285 --> 17:19.204
Well, there is no such thing
as trying to write.

17:19.288 --> 17:20.622
One writes, or one doesn't.

17:20.915 --> 17:23.750
You have to take every opportunity
to practice your craft.

17:24.292 --> 17:27.212
Anyway, I know you have inherited
some writing talent from me,

17:27.296 --> 17:28.839
because I am a truly great writer.

17:29.799 --> 17:30.882
I'm going to show you something.

17:35.179 --> 17:38.807
I have a letter from Viking Press.

17:39.183 --> 17:40.934
You've heard of Viking Press, haven't you?

17:41.018 --> 17:42.060
Yeah.

17:42.145 --> 17:44.271
Look at this. Look at that phrase there.

17:44.355 --> 17:47.649
"Your book is a virtuoso
display of personality.

17:49.193 --> 17:52.571
"Unfortunately, its dosage would kill
hardier readers than we have here."

17:52.655 --> 17:55.157
"Virtuoso display," Viking Press.

17:55.700 --> 17:58.827
Well, it's been a great
pleasure, Nicholas.

18:00.204 --> 18:01.455
Well, hey, uh...

18:02.206 --> 18:03.248
All right.

18:04.709 --> 18:08.003
You need anything? Aside from the Pollock?

18:08.463 --> 18:09.504
No.

18:10.173 --> 18:12.549
All right. Well, au revoir, then.

18:23.352 --> 18:24.394
You're welcome.

18:24.479 --> 18:25.896
Don't mention it.

18:28.566 --> 18:29.858
Your father's a nightmare.

18:31.110 --> 18:32.527
What's that?

18:32.987 --> 18:34.196
(LAUGHS)

18:34.363 --> 18:36.072
It's a fucking Jackson Pollock painting.

18:36.365 --> 18:38.366
Jackson Pollock? Jesus!

18:39.118 --> 18:40.202
Hmm.

18:41.370 --> 18:44.748
Pollock spelled his name
wrong when he signed it.

18:48.628 --> 18:50.170
NICK: So then he gives me a gift,

18:50.254 --> 18:52.172
a Jackson Pollock painting.

18:52.256 --> 18:54.549
Which, like an asshole, I think is real.

18:54.634 --> 18:56.176
So after 18 years of wondering,

18:56.260 --> 18:57.928
here's what I learned about my father.

18:58.012 --> 19:01.014
He's a racist, he's a homophobe,
and he's fucking crazy.

19:01.098 --> 19:04.309
Can you reach him? I mean,
if you wanted to?

19:04.393 --> 19:06.478
I don't know that I ever want
to see him again. Really.

19:07.688 --> 19:08.897
I don't know how I feel about it.

19:08.981 --> 19:12.192
I can't really locate what I feel.

19:12.276 --> 19:13.443
Is that why you called me?

19:13.694 --> 19:15.320
To help you locate your feelings?

19:15.488 --> 19:19.199
Do you want to get out of
here? You look beautiful.

19:19.283 --> 19:20.826
None of that. We're friends now.

19:20.910 --> 19:22.369
We're friends?

19:22.453 --> 19:23.495
Yeah.

19:23.871 --> 19:26.039
I mean, don't get me wrong, I enjoyed
sleeping with you, but...

19:26.249 --> 19:27.249
Thank you.

19:27.333 --> 19:28.416
I told you I didn't want a relationship.

19:28.626 --> 19:30.752
So, now we're friends.

19:31.587 --> 19:34.422
Okay. Well, thanks for letting me know.

19:35.216 --> 19:36.758
You're welcome.

19:39.846 --> 19:42.389
You should think about working
at Harbor Street.

19:43.266 --> 19:44.641
Why?

19:44.725 --> 19:46.309
Well, I was in kind of a fucked state,

19:46.394 --> 19:47.936
mentally, when I started there.

19:48.980 --> 19:51.648
Um, yeah, just, I like working there.

19:55.278 --> 19:57.779
Tell me about your fucked state.

20:00.783 --> 20:03.034
Do you want another one of these?

20:13.921 --> 20:15.338
All right?

20:16.632 --> 20:19.050
Hey, how are you? How's it going?

20:34.150 --> 20:35.609
How did you hear about this job?

20:36.569 --> 20:39.321
A friend of mine, Denise, works here.

20:39.405 --> 20:40.447
Okay.

20:41.949 --> 20:43.992
So what makes you want to
work with the homeless?

20:45.703 --> 20:47.245
I don't know. Uh...

20:50.166 --> 20:53.460
I mean, we are put on this Earth
to help other people, right?

20:53.544 --> 20:55.295
Someone I knew told me that.

20:55.379 --> 20:56.379
Who?

20:56.839 --> 20:59.591
Who? No one. Uh...

20:59.675 --> 21:02.802
Look, I guess I just see homeless
people everywhere.

21:02.887 --> 21:04.888
It seems like there is more and more.

21:05.765 --> 21:06.806
Seems like it.

21:08.684 --> 21:11.603
I guess I just want a job that,
you know, means something.

21:11.687 --> 21:14.940
Something where I don't despise myself
when I come home from work.

21:15.024 --> 21:16.524
So you despise yourself?

21:18.444 --> 21:21.196
I don't know. Uh, sure. Doesn't everyone?

21:21.280 --> 21:22.864
I don't despise myself.

21:24.200 --> 21:25.617
I used to be a guest here.

21:26.327 --> 21:29.871
Then I worked here. I had a permanent bed.

21:29.956 --> 21:31.706
And then I moved out.

21:31.791 --> 21:35.293
I got a job in construction,
became the foreman.

21:35.378 --> 21:37.379
Then one day I came back here
to give something back.

21:37.463 --> 21:38.964
So I've come a long way up,

21:39.048 --> 21:40.382
but it's a quick fall down.

21:40.466 --> 21:42.884
So I really can't afford to hate myself.

21:42.969 --> 21:44.469
You know what I'm talking about?

21:49.517 --> 21:50.850
You don't know what I'm talking about.

21:51.560 --> 21:53.561
But that's okay.

21:54.730 --> 21:58.400
Tell you what. I can put
you on the fill-in list.

21:58.484 --> 22:01.903
If we need somebody to
fill in, we'll call.

22:02.321 --> 22:03.947
Thanks.

22:06.784 --> 22:10.245
Hey, so why do they call you Captain?

22:11.580 --> 22:13.123
Because I'm the Captain.

22:14.750 --> 22:16.209
Okay.

22:18.587 --> 22:19.587
IVAN: Just bring it by right now.

22:20.464 --> 22:21.881
Okay, later.

22:22.258 --> 22:24.259
Hey, they called from Harbor Street Inn.

22:24.343 --> 22:26.344
They want you to fill in tonight.

22:27.513 --> 22:29.014
Tonight?

22:37.148 --> 22:39.399
NICK: There were different types
of people who worked there.

22:39.483 --> 22:40.859
There were the religious types.

22:40.943 --> 22:43.028
I want to live my life
the way Christ does.

22:43.112 --> 22:45.363
Also, I hate my rich parents.

22:45.448 --> 22:46.531
Hey, guys, can you bring those over here?

22:46.615 --> 22:47.615
There were the punks.

22:47.700 --> 22:50.160
Check in, sir, and we are gonna
get you to the clinic.

22:50.244 --> 22:51.286
This place is hardcore.

22:51.370 --> 22:53.163
Plus, the pay is not bad. Next.

22:53.247 --> 22:54.372
There were the ex-cons.

22:54.457 --> 22:57.625
All right, next. So this dude
was gonna shoot me, right?

22:57.710 --> 23:00.336
So, I turned sideways, 'cause
that is what you do.

23:00.421 --> 23:02.839
You turn sideways, you take it in the arm.

23:02.923 --> 23:05.550
I flex my bicep, I take the bullet.

23:05.634 --> 23:10.263
And then I grabbed the gun from this
guy, and I'm like bam-bam-bam-bam.

23:10.347 --> 23:12.974
Right in his fucking head, then
it's like click-click-click.

23:14.060 --> 23:17.312
Let me tell you, I had to disappear
for a while after that.

23:17.396 --> 23:18.855
All right, put your arms up.

23:18.939 --> 23:20.482
Joy was an ex-cokehead and a prostitute.

23:20.566 --> 23:21.608
JOY: There you go, honey.

23:21.692 --> 23:23.735
Now, she's like a mother to the guys.

23:23.819 --> 23:25.070
Unfortunately, in a couple of years,

23:25.154 --> 23:27.405
she will be sitting in a room with
a shotgun across her lap,

23:27.490 --> 23:30.241
back to dealing and smoking crack 24/7.

23:30.326 --> 23:32.494
It's hard to stay changed.

23:34.663 --> 23:37.290
I start out working inside the
cage handing out bed tickets,

23:37.374 --> 23:40.543
collecting people's valuables and
locking them up overnight.

23:41.003 --> 23:43.421
It's Friday, payday. A lot
of the guests have jobs.

23:43.506 --> 23:46.007
There is more money to slip
into the envelopes.

23:46.884 --> 23:47.926
Let's go. Hey!

23:48.010 --> 23:49.761
The air is thick, stale,
smells like sweat.

23:49.845 --> 23:51.221
Back off.

23:51.305 --> 23:52.722
Friday, the drunks are more boisterous.

23:52.848 --> 23:54.974
MAN 1: Move up, old man! MAN 2: Why
you always got to be touching me?

23:55.059 --> 23:56.768
Because you are standing
still, that's why.

23:56.852 --> 23:59.562
Every single day, I get in line,
and you're right up my ass.

23:59.855 --> 24:01.231
(ARGUING INDISTINCTLY)

24:01.524 --> 24:02.524
Maybe I should help.

24:02.608 --> 24:04.234
Yeah, maybe not. Not yet.

24:04.902 --> 24:06.236
(CONTINUES ARGUING)

24:06.695 --> 24:08.446
There is a balance between
escalating and defusing.

24:08.697 --> 24:11.282
Knowing when to step in,
and when to back off.

24:11.367 --> 24:12.867
Hey, buddy, calm down!

24:13.702 --> 24:15.120
Oh, shit.

24:15.204 --> 24:16.704
I don't know that balance yet.

24:16.789 --> 24:18.498
Well? Are you able to locate
your feelings now?

24:18.582 --> 24:20.208
Yeah, this fucking hurts.

24:20.292 --> 24:21.626
You are going to have a good shiner.

24:21.710 --> 24:23.586
You didn't tell me this
place was such a rush.

24:23.671 --> 24:26.923
It's addictive. Watch out,
or you will never leave.

24:27.550 --> 24:29.968
So, how many of these people
get back on their feet?

24:30.052 --> 24:31.511
I couldn't tell you.

24:31.595 --> 24:33.721
But what I do know is a year from now,

24:33.806 --> 24:37.767
100-150 of the guys who come
through here will be dead.

24:37.852 --> 24:41.271
We catch them on the way down.
Next stop, the morgue.

24:53.993 --> 24:56.202
Hey. Steady Ray, as ever.

24:56.370 --> 24:57.704
Jonathan, how are you?

24:57.788 --> 25:00.206
So, I thought I might stay over tonight.

25:00.291 --> 25:03.459
I find myself momentarily between places.

25:03.544 --> 25:06.921
The thing is, Claire's mom is
here. She's staying with us.

25:07.006 --> 25:09.299
That is okay. I'll sleep on the couch.

25:09.383 --> 25:10.925
No, that is where she's staying.

25:11.010 --> 25:12.677
We are renovating the guest room.

25:12.761 --> 25:15.305
Tell her to get the fuck off
and let me sleep with her.

25:15.681 --> 25:16.764
Is she nice?

25:16.891 --> 25:17.974
Yeah. You met her?

Mother-in-law

25:20.936 --> 25:22.353
Hey, honey!

25:22.438 --> 25:23.438
Shh.

25:26.108 --> 25:27.942
I mean, this wasn't because of the old

25:28.027 --> 25:29.485
burning-of-the-Christmas-tree
thing, was it?

25:29.570 --> 25:31.279
No. That's ancient history.

25:31.488 --> 25:34.824
Exactly, because it was really funny.
You got to admit, it was.

25:34.909 --> 25:36.659
Yeah. That was a lot of fun.

25:37.286 --> 25:40.413
Sure, all right. Well, okay,
give Claire de Lune my love.

25:40.497 --> 25:42.290
And I'm going to try Dugan.

25:43.459 --> 25:44.918
He is always begging me to come over

25:45.002 --> 25:46.419
and provide some free entertainment for

25:46.503 --> 25:47.879
him and his miserable missus.

25:48.172 --> 25:49.464
Dugan moved to Florida.

25:49.548 --> 25:51.424
He did? Moved to Florida? Why
the hell would he do that?

25:51.508 --> 25:52.926
I don't know, the weather.

25:53.010 --> 25:54.761
Oh, the weather.

25:54.845 --> 25:57.180
Okay, looks like I'm going to
head to my suite at the Ritz.

25:57.973 --> 25:59.390
I'm sorry. Okay, Ray.

25:59.475 --> 26:00.892
Good night. All right. Good night.

You shit at the bus station,

26:50.025 --> 26:52.193
you shower at the Y.

26:52.278 --> 26:53.778
But it's not all fun and games.

26:53.862 --> 26:55.822
Cabbies get shot in the head every night.

26:56.031 --> 26:58.866
Bamo! Right in the jugular. Right
in the fucking jugular.

26:58.951 --> 27:02.203

The police said I hit someone,
or some fucking thing.

27:55.299 --> 27:57.258
What can I say to that?

28:01.138 --> 28:04.682
Now, I have no license, no
cab, no place to sleep.

28:04.767 --> 28:08.353
Perhaps I'll start a new book,
Memoirs of a Moron!

NICK: After the cage, I work housing.

28:28.707 --> 28:31.626
It's more intense. You are not
protected behind steel mesh.

28:33.128 --> 28:35.713
Okay, grab a cup, have a good shower.

28:38.675 --> 28:40.385
Hey, I'll meet you in the
hot room in 10 minutes.

28:40.469 --> 28:41.511
Okay. If I'm not there,

28:41.595 --> 28:43.012
just take your clothes off
and start without me.

28:43.097 --> 28:44.555
Okay.

28:44.681 --> 28:48.267
The hot room smells of superheated
sweat, quick fermented.

29:14.044 --> 29:15.503
Excuse me.

29:15.671 --> 29:17.004
I need a new pair of pants.

29:26.974 --> 29:29.350
No problem. I'll be right back.

29:36.358 --> 29:39.485
Hey, how do I know what size he wears?

29:40.028 --> 29:41.654
You ask him.

29:42.364 --> 29:45.283
At Harbor Street you write up every
day's events in the log,

29:45.367 --> 29:47.702
and you read off your entry that night.

29:47.786 --> 29:49.370
He's not gonna bite.

29:49.455 --> 29:52.206
I take that opportunity to practice.

29:52.291 --> 29:56.961
"9: 10, Isaac Clegg fell out of
bed, and the bed fell on him.

"I make an attempt to bandage him."

I'm just gonna wrap this
around you. You okay?

30:16.648 --> 30:20.109
"9:30, I was able to convince George D.

30:20.194 --> 30:22.487
"To sit still for his monthly de-lousing."

My beloved family, they beheaded
me, their beloved Queen.

I would never hurt them.

I would never kill them.

30:40.756 --> 30:44.133
Hey, it's okay, man. I understand, George.

30:44.218 --> 30:48.804
But, I mean, they beheaded you,
didn't they? So why not?

30:55.729 --> 30:57.355
This is the right decision, George.

30:57.606 --> 31:00.816

me understand my purpose more

34:14.219 --> 34:16.469
The proper study of mankind is man.

Ortega y Gasset defined genius as the
ability to invent one's occupation.

a movie of my life.

Excuse me?

35:19.201 --> 35:20.451
They're making a movie.

35:22.412 --> 35:23.829
They are?

35:23.914 --> 35:26.457
Who in living hell would want to
make a movie about your life?

35:26.541 --> 35:29.710

piece of shit movie.

36:22.264 --> 36:23.973
I'm going to write a poem about you, Dawn.

36:24.057 --> 36:25.724

37:50.769 --> 37:54.772
NICK: He's seen this before. Bums
sprawled out from drinking.

37:54.856 --> 37:58.150
But he has never actually
stood over the blowers,

37:58.234 --> 38:01.153
let the hot air seep into his clothes.

38:01.237 --> 38:02.863
The air is sucked out of the library.

38:02.948 --> 38:06.617
Even on the coldest nights there
is too much heat inside.

38:07.744 --> 38:09.578
It's another prison, these blowers.

38:09.704 --> 38:12.456
Because once you have landed,
you can't leave.

38:12.540 --> 38:16.460
Because one step off the blower
is cold, hypothermia cold,

38:16.544 --> 38:18.921
now that you are sodden with steam.

38:19.005 --> 38:22.383
The blower is a room of
heat with no walls.

38:25.428 --> 38:29.306
My father is an invisible man,
in an invisible room,

38:29.391 --> 38:31.642
in the invisible city.

38:41.027 --> 38:42.152
Whoo!

38:50.787 --> 38:52.454
I really appreciate the help, sir.

38:52.539 --> 38:54.456
Call me Carlos. Okay. Carlos.

38:54.874 --> 38:57.042
So, Jerry, how many nights
have you been homeless?

38:57.127 --> 38:59.795
Just one night. One bad night
with the wife, boy.

38:59.879 --> 39:00.879
That is all it takes, one bad night.

39:00.964 --> 39:01.964
You got that right.

39:02.048 --> 39:03.757
What is up, Nick?

39:03.925 --> 39:07.428
MAN: For the new guys, no
bottles or weapons, okay?

39:07.512 --> 39:09.221
All right, you're good.

39:09.347 --> 39:12.683
Stretch your arms out for me,
sir. Please? Thank you.

39:14.769 --> 39:16.770
All right. Step up.

39:24.446 --> 39:27.406
I'd like a room for the evening.

39:27.949 --> 39:29.283
You want a bed?

39:29.534 --> 39:30.576
That'll do for now.

39:32.328 --> 39:34.538
Well, this is a pleasant surprise.

39:34.622 --> 39:36.081
So, you're employed here now?

39:36.875 --> 39:38.625
Yes, I'm employed here.

39:39.169 --> 39:41.962
Well, I approve. We are put on this
Earth to help other people.

39:44.090 --> 39:45.966
You must be gathering some
excellent material.

39:56.978 --> 39:58.437
Many thanks.

39:58.521 --> 40:01.440
And if a private room does
open up, I'd be grateful.

40:13.411 --> 40:14.703
Hey, what's up?

40:14.788 --> 40:16.246
My father is here.

What? My father, he's here.

Nick, man, you are the
unluckiest guy I know.

40:28.051 --> 40:30.469
Thanks, Carlos. Just keep it
to yourself, man. Please?

40:30.553 --> 40:31.804
No worries.

40:47.278 --> 40:49.488
Hey, Nick. You feel like
going home tonight?

40:49.572 --> 40:51.031
No. Why?

40:52.367 --> 40:54.243
Because your father is here.

40:55.203 --> 40:56.286
So you heard about that.

40:56.371 --> 40:57.454
Yeah.

40:57.539 --> 40:59.081
Who else knows?

40:59.165 --> 41:00.874
We are with you, man.

41:00.959 --> 41:02.543
Fucking Carlos.

41:02.710 --> 41:05.254
Maybe you could take the night off.
You know, I can get a fill-in.

41:05.338 --> 41:07.131
No.

41:07.215 --> 41:10.008
It's my job. I work here.

42:34.302 --> 42:36.303
Interesting view.

42:38.139 --> 42:40.849
I thought you were staying
at a friend's place?

42:40.934 --> 42:42.559
A couple of things fell through.

42:42.644 --> 42:44.269
I was bunking in my cab for a while,

42:44.354 --> 42:46.271
but that is no longer possible.

42:46.356 --> 42:48.273
So I have been sleeping alfresco.

42:48.650 --> 42:52.069
Alfresco? You mean outside? For how long?

42:54.405 --> 42:55.989
Three weeks or so.

42:57.033 --> 43:00.786
Don't look so grave. This is
a great opportunity for me.

43:01.037 --> 43:02.246
What opportunity?

43:03.122 --> 43:05.249
The opportunity to freeze to death?

43:05.333 --> 43:08.001
The opportunity to see how
the other half lives.

43:08.086 --> 43:10.462
The poor, the downtrodden.

43:10.546 --> 43:13.298
I'm doing the same thing here as
you are, gathering material.

43:13.508 --> 43:17.177
No, I'm not gathering material.
This is my life.

43:17.428 --> 43:19.221
Life is gathering material.

43:20.974 --> 43:24.559
I like that. Help me remember that.

43:25.103 --> 43:26.979
They won't even let me bring
a goddamned pen up here.

43:27.063 --> 43:28.188
Can't you do anything about that?

43:28.982 --> 43:30.607
No. Don't you have any clout around here?

43:31.276 --> 43:32.567
Sorry.

43:32.652 --> 43:36.655
Well, anyway, my writing is going
extremely well, by the by.

43:37.407 --> 43:40.617
I'm already almost done with
my revisions to Chapter 37.

43:41.369 --> 43:44.288
Perhaps I'll let you read
it someday. It's classic.

43:44.414 --> 43:46.415
Okay, look, you can't stay here. Why not?

43:47.000 --> 43:48.292
Because I work here.

43:49.460 --> 43:52.170
Well, don't worry. This is only
a very temporary situation.

43:52.255 --> 43:54.298
I don't want to disrupt
your life in the least.

43:54.382 --> 43:56.591
I have a friend of mine who's begging
me to move down to Florida.

43:56.676 --> 43:58.885
He has a guest house and
a job there for me.

43:59.012 --> 44:01.555
Okay. Florida, that sounds great.

44:02.223 --> 44:03.390
In the meantime,

44:03.474 --> 44:05.017
this is an excellent opportunity for

44:05.101 --> 44:06.643
you and I to make up for lost time.

44:07.395 --> 44:09.896
Destiny has brought us together
for one fleeting moment.

44:11.065 --> 44:13.358
Let us not spit in its eye.

44:23.369 --> 44:24.578
IVAN: Thank you again, man.

44:24.662 --> 44:26.330
And you know, let me know if
that shit don't work out.

44:26.414 --> 44:27.372
Let me know, all right?

44:27.457 --> 44:28.498
MAN: Okay. We'll see you.

44:28.583 --> 44:29.666
All right.

44:32.253 --> 44:34.546
I mean, you could ask him to
stay here for a few days.

44:34.964 --> 44:36.131
No, he can't.

44:37.008 --> 44:38.508
I don't even know if the
Florida thing is real.

44:38.843 --> 44:40.427
I hope so, for your sake.

44:42.305 --> 44:43.513
Just weed, right?

44:44.057 --> 44:45.098
Excuse me?

44:45.183 --> 44:46.808
You're only selling weed, right?

44:47.143 --> 44:48.769
Yeah, just weed.

44:48.853 --> 44:50.854
I'm just saying, he's your father.

44:51.439 --> 44:52.564
Uh...

44:52.940 --> 44:54.066
I've had father figures.

44:55.276 --> 44:58.111
All right, Nick! Keep
your eye on the ball.

44:58.946 --> 45:00.614
They were all burned up.

45:02.367 --> 45:04.993
It's amazing what can happen
to the human body, Nick.

45:06.829 --> 45:08.330
Hey! What the hell are you showing him?

45:08.414 --> 45:10.123
Hey, sweetie. What the fuck, Travis?

45:10.792 --> 45:12.876
Pick that up! Come on,
I want to talk to you.

45:22.512 --> 45:24.471
I thought he was a little young
to be driving a car.

45:24.764 --> 45:26.473
You could have killed
yourself. Get inside!

45:28.726 --> 45:29.810
Thank you very much.

45:30.186 --> 45:31.561
You're welcome.

45:32.188 --> 45:33.480
Have a good day. You, too.

45:37.985 --> 45:40.404
My mom had a lot of different
boyfriends, growing up.

45:40.488 --> 45:43.865
Come on, buddy. Good job.

46:06.305 --> 46:08.014
But I never had a father.

46:13.688 --> 46:14.855
Luckily, I had a mother.

46:14.981 --> 46:18.024
Hey, who you playing ball with?

46:18.317 --> 46:20.402
Nobody. Myself.

46:21.988 --> 46:23.238
Get your mitt.

46:23.322 --> 46:25.991
Honey, I'm exhausted.

46:27.743 --> 46:28.869
Okay.

46:30.538 --> 46:31.788
All right.

46:33.124 --> 46:35.000
Let me get my mitt. Heads up!

46:35.376 --> 46:36.877
Good one. Thanks.

46:37.003 --> 46:38.837
I'll be right back. Okay.

46:55.062 --> 46:57.022
You are not listening
to me. I'm listening.

46:57.106 --> 46:59.941
He stole $30 from me!

47:00.026 --> 47:01.526
I understand that. Hey, Nick!

47:01.611 --> 47:03.153
Jonathan asked me to give
this letter to you, man.

47:03.237 --> 47:05.071
So he's some kind of famous writer?

47:05.156 --> 47:07.657
Yeah, that's why he's staying
at Harbor Street.

47:09.785 --> 47:13.455
JONATHAN: Dear Nick, many deep
thanks for your warm welcome.

47:13.539 --> 47:15.415
I must say you seemed anxious.

47:15.500 --> 47:17.626
Of course, writers, especially poets,

47:17.710 --> 47:19.753
are particularly prone to madness.

47:19.837 --> 47:21.254
Hey, babe.

47:21.589 --> 47:23.089
Okay.

47:23.174 --> 47:25.550
There exists a striking association

47:25.635 --> 47:27.969
between creativity and manic depression.

47:28.638 --> 47:32.098
The only important thing, though,
is to simply do the work.

47:34.435 --> 47:40.232
It's not a sharp pain, it's a dull
pain. I haven't eaten in two days.

47:45.112 --> 47:47.280
Hey, straight through the
back, down the stairs.

48:01.754 --> 48:03.088
JONATHAN: Most of these guys here are

48:03.172 --> 48:06.174
a bunch of fucking deadbeat
panhandlers and pederasts.

48:06.259 --> 48:08.635
These perverts, they wouldn't last
a second in federal prison.

48:09.011 --> 48:13.139
They are all homosexuals. I despise
homosexuals, and they despise me.

48:13.224 --> 48:15.350
I know what I'm talking about.
I talk the straight talk.

48:15.434 --> 48:17.686
I wasn't locked up in federal
prison with choirboys,

48:17.770 --> 48:19.271
that's for sure. JODY: Next, please.

48:33.244 --> 48:34.995
Thank you.

48:36.622 --> 48:37.831
Hey.

48:37.915 --> 48:38.957
Hi.

48:39.041 --> 48:40.667
See this? Uh-huh.

48:41.043 --> 48:42.794
Don't ever become a writer.

49:18.372 --> 49:20.665
Just around the corner to the
right, follow the hallway.

49:20.750 --> 49:21.791
You know where to go.

49:21.876 --> 49:22.834
Jesus. Hey, what happened to you?

49:22.918 --> 49:23.918
I'm fine.

49:24.003 --> 49:25.211
You're fine? You should get to the clinic.

49:25.296 --> 49:28.423
You should see the other cocksuckers.
This is nothing.

49:28.507 --> 49:31.468
By the way, I have a little gift for you.

49:31.552 --> 49:33.678
From one writer to another.

50:02.708 --> 50:04.584
Is there a tailor here?

50:04.669 --> 50:06.127
No.

50:06.504 --> 50:07.796
I'm going to need a new coat.

50:08.673 --> 50:09.839
Okay.

50:22.937 --> 50:24.354
All right, so I won't be there.

50:24.438 --> 50:26.439
But I'll get there next time, okay?

50:27.441 --> 50:28.650
All right.

50:28.984 --> 50:30.068
Hey.

50:31.445 --> 50:34.030
You are not just selling weed, right?

50:40.162 --> 50:42.831
Watch your hands. Watch your hands.

50:42.915 --> 50:44.541
Why should a truly great writer

50:44.625 --> 50:46.459
be subjected to these fucking indignities?

50:51.882 --> 50:53.299
There we go.

50:54.677 --> 50:55.760
JONATHAN: What are you doing?
That's my property.

50:55.845 --> 50:56.845
Come on, get out of here.

50:56.929 --> 50:58.513
That's my property. That's my property.

50:58.597 --> 50:59.597
Fucking homo.

50:59.682 --> 51:00.807
Calm down. Calm down, now.

51:00.891 --> 51:02.976
I'm going to transform this
cesspool of a world.

51:03.060 --> 51:05.645
I'm going to transform it
with a fucking word!

51:10.317 --> 51:12.819
You know, he is not going anywhere.

51:12.903 --> 51:14.571
It's been weeks.

51:16.157 --> 51:18.575
What do you suggest I do about it?

51:19.869 --> 51:21.870
Get a job somewhere else?

51:26.083 --> 51:27.250
Hey,

51:28.669 --> 51:30.670
you want to do some blow?

51:30.963 --> 51:32.005
Um...

51:32.590 --> 51:34.132
I despise blow.

51:34.800 --> 51:37.177
Turns people into fucking scumbags.

51:38.095 --> 51:40.430
But you go ahead if you want to.

51:42.349 --> 51:45.393
GABRIEL: 12:30, Floyd Perkins
reports physical altercation.

51:45.478 --> 51:46.853
Report completed.

51:46.937 --> 51:50.315
2:00 a.m., shift change. Brian
gets permission to sign out.

51:50.399 --> 51:52.609
7:00 p.m., Jon Flynn was caught

51:52.693 --> 51:54.068
trying to smuggle a bottle in tonight.

51:54.153 --> 51:57.071
At first he was abusive, but he calmed
down and was given a warning.

51:57.156 --> 51:58.615
He wasn't put out for the night?

52:01.702 --> 52:02.952
It's cold out there, man.

52:03.704 --> 52:06.790
He asked me to give a letter to you.

52:13.214 --> 52:14.339
JONATHAN: Nick,

52:15.090 --> 52:17.467
I thought last evening at Harbor Street,

52:17.551 --> 52:19.469
waiting for 8:00 p.m. To come...

52:19.553 --> 52:22.847
I thought if your very beautiful
mother were alive,

52:22.932 --> 52:25.600
and if she could somehow see this scene,

52:25.684 --> 52:27.769
her son at work and his father a resident

52:27.853 --> 52:30.980
at Harbor Street shelter for the homeless.

52:33.400 --> 52:36.986
The beaten, the sad, the losers
in life's great game.

52:37.947 --> 52:41.699
Jody would have laughed loudly
at the entire macabre scene.

52:48.207 --> 52:52.544
She was the most beautiful
woman in the world.

52:57.091 --> 52:59.217
She was the love of my life.

53:01.512 --> 53:03.304
The light of my love.

53:05.391 --> 53:08.893
If she were here today, she
would be with me now.

53:12.940 --> 53:14.440
What happened

53:16.527 --> 53:18.570
to my face?

53:19.572 --> 53:21.489
I'm only 28 years old.

53:23.409 --> 53:25.159
Why do I look like this?

53:25.244 --> 53:26.911
Excuse me? What happened to me?

53:26.996 --> 53:29.581
What happened! What have you done to me?

53:29.665 --> 53:30.915
What have you done to me?

53:31.000 --> 53:34.127
COUNSELOR: He kept shouting at
me that he was 28 years old,

53:34.211 --> 53:37.630
and it just... It kind of freaked
me out, and I just...

53:38.591 --> 53:40.008
What are you looking at?

53:41.510 --> 53:42.719
Nothing.

53:42.803 --> 53:43.928
I'm sorry.

53:44.013 --> 53:45.722
Don't be sorry. Sorry for what?

53:47.933 --> 53:49.934
That it freaked you out?

53:50.019 --> 53:51.185
It's nothing.

53:51.270 --> 53:52.604
Wait until you have been
here a few months.

53:52.688 --> 53:54.063
Easy, Nick. Take it easy.

53:54.148 --> 53:55.899
I am taking it easy.

53:57.651 --> 54:00.153
This isn't me we are talking about.

54:00.696 --> 54:01.863
CAPTAIN: No, it's not.

54:05.367 --> 54:06.409
Go ahead.

54:08.746 --> 54:13.541
11: 15, tables and chairs put away
in the gym from overflow.

54:32.686 --> 54:35.021
Did you read my last letter?

54:36.815 --> 54:37.857
Yes.

54:39.818 --> 54:41.277
Beautifully written, wasn't it?

54:42.696 --> 54:44.447
Don't write to me about my fucking mother.

54:44.531 --> 54:46.282
Your fucking mother?

54:47.034 --> 54:50.662
Your fucking mother? How dare
you refer to her that way.

54:50.746 --> 54:53.498
How dare you say, "How dare you," to me.

54:53.958 --> 54:56.626
Well, let me rephrase it. Don't fucking
write to me about my mother.

54:56.710 --> 55:00.046
It only makes you sound childish
using profanity like that.

55:00.130 --> 55:03.132
Sorry, you don't get to
patronize me. Okay?

55:03.217 --> 55:05.426
You don't get to pretend to be my father

55:05.511 --> 55:07.553
and you don't get to write
about my mother.

55:07.638 --> 55:09.806
In fact, stop writing me at all.

55:09.890 --> 55:11.182
Stop writing me letters.

55:11.266 --> 55:12.350
You should save them.

55:12.434 --> 55:14.143
They'll be worth money someday.

55:14.228 --> 55:16.354
I have saved them, actually.

55:16.438 --> 55:18.147
I have over 100. That's enough.

55:18.232 --> 55:19.691
You saved them. Good.

55:21.318 --> 55:25.071
You bring liquor in here again,
you are barred. End of story.

55:25.155 --> 55:27.699
Eano the Beano tells me
you are into drugs.

55:27.783 --> 55:30.785
Who the fuck is Eano the Beano?
How would he know that?

55:30.869 --> 55:32.912
Everybody knows, the word is out.

55:33.080 --> 55:35.164
You know, if so, good luck to you.

55:35.249 --> 55:36.874
But don't waste your talent.

55:36.959 --> 55:38.292
I don't have any talent.

55:38.377 --> 55:39.961
I find that hard to believe.

55:40.045 --> 55:42.380
Why? Because you're so
incredibly talented?

55:42.464 --> 55:43.464
Yes.

55:43.549 --> 55:45.174
Okay, so where is it?

55:45.801 --> 55:47.427
The masterpiece.

55:48.971 --> 55:51.014
Where are you hiding it?

55:51.098 --> 55:52.640
Can I read it? Does it even exist?

55:52.725 --> 55:54.392
Do you exist, Nicholas Flynn?

55:54.768 --> 55:55.852
Do you even know?

55:55.936 --> 55:58.813
I, Jonathan Flynn, exist!
I know that much.

55:58.897 --> 56:00.523
Jonathan Flynn exists!

56:00.607 --> 56:01.691
MAN: Shut the fuck up!

56:01.775 --> 56:03.359
You shut the fuck up,

56:03.444 --> 56:05.445
or my son will evict you!

56:06.947 --> 56:08.156
I want you to leave here.

56:08.240 --> 56:10.533
Find some fucking place,

56:10.617 --> 56:13.536
some old drinking buddy who is suicidal
enough to take you in.

56:13.620 --> 56:15.538
I'm a sought-after house guest.

56:15.622 --> 56:17.874
Yeah, because you're an excellent
raconteur. Right?

56:17.958 --> 56:19.000
Yes! Good night!

56:19.084 --> 56:20.585
Remember something, Nicholas.

56:20.669 --> 56:22.378
You are me!

56:22.463 --> 56:23.963
You are me! I made you!

56:24.048 --> 56:25.048
(MEN CLAMORING)

56:25.132 --> 56:26.549
You are me!

56:26.633 --> 56:29.218
I am not you! I am not you!

No. That guy is just a drunk.

could have jerked off

01:09:45.473 --> 01:09:46.515
No birth.

01:09:48.059 --> 01:09:49.309
Got anything for me?

01:09:50.353 --> 01:09:51.770
What? What?

01:09:52.354 --> 01:09:55.023
You think you are so fucking
tough, huh? Come here!

coming into the room.

01:10:29.642 --> 01:10:32.019
that we do have free coffee
and cookies over there.

01:10:32.103 --> 01:10:34.605
And I can testify about the
goodness of the cookies.

01:10:34.689 --> 01:10:37.649
I baked them myself, they are fantastic.

go ahead and raise your hand. We
would love to hear from you.

01:10:48.244 --> 01:10:50.704
I was 11 when I got high
for the first time,

01:10:51.497 --> 01:10:53.665
and it felt like I was home.

01:10:54.834 --> 01:10:57.294
Well, I woke up one morning in Paris.

01:10:57.378 --> 01:11:00.756
It took me a while to figure
out that I was in Paris.

01:11:01.215 --> 01:11:02.758
And I had completely forgotten that I had

01:11:02.842 --> 01:11:05.135
flown a 747 full of people
the night before.

01:11:05.219 --> 01:11:07.971
I was out of the hospital
no more than three weeks.

01:11:08.056 --> 01:11:10.557
And I stayed over my mother's house.

01:11:10.642 --> 01:11:12.726
I couldn't take it anymore.

01:11:13.311 --> 01:11:17.022
I doused my hand with lighter
fluid and lit it on fire

01:11:17.941 --> 01:11:19.942
just to get the morphine.

01:11:20.360 --> 01:11:21.693
Go figure.

01:11:23.780 --> 01:11:24.947

MARIE: I saw your father the other day.

01:11:57.397 --> 01:11:58.981
He didn't look so good.

01:11:59.065 --> 01:12:00.190
You know my father?

01:12:00.274 --> 01:12:02.317
He is a hard guy not to know.

01:12:07.281 --> 01:12:08.615
Thank you.

01:12:10.410 --> 01:12:11.994
Your old man doesn't look good.

01:12:12.078 --> 01:12:14.037
Someone should get him inside.

01:12:14.122 --> 01:12:15.664
Well, you should get inside.

01:12:15.748 --> 01:12:17.916
We can get you in somewhere.

01:12:18.918 --> 01:12:21.670
He sleeps in the parking garage, right?

01:12:21.754 --> 01:12:23.338
Barlow's garage?

01:12:24.090 --> 01:12:25.132
Don't know.

01:12:25.758 --> 01:12:29.386
The other day Barlow and Ron
were giving him a hard time.

01:12:30.930 --> 01:12:34.725
Barlow killed a guy, 16 years in Walpole.

01:12:35.560 --> 01:12:36.893
They shouldn't have let him out.

01:12:38.396 --> 01:12:39.980
A guy like that.

01:12:41.441 --> 01:12:45.235
Barlow and Ron lure your
old man upstairs...

01:12:45.445 --> 01:12:46.903
BARLOW: Hey, buddy. ...to the top floor.

01:12:46.988 --> 01:12:48.280
Let's have a drink.

01:12:48.364 --> 01:12:50.032
You want to have a drink with us?

01:12:50.116 --> 01:12:51.366
Said they have a bottle.

01:12:51.659 --> 01:12:53.035
When they get to the top,

01:12:53.119 --> 01:12:56.913
they grab him and hold him over
the edge, upside down.

01:12:57.248 --> 01:13:00.292
I told you not to come around here
no more. This is Barlow's garage.

01:13:00.376 --> 01:13:01.960
This is my garage, bitch!

01:13:02.670 --> 01:13:03.754
He didn't drop him?

01:13:03.880 --> 01:13:04.963
Said next time

01:13:05.048 --> 01:13:06.590
he'll drop him.

01:13:07.216 --> 01:13:10.010
He's a freaking psycho, Barlow.

01:13:15.058 --> 01:13:18.185
The manager kicks you out
of this place at 9: 15.

01:13:18.269 --> 01:13:20.771
The sign on the door says it
doesn't close until 9:30.

01:13:20.855 --> 01:13:22.606
How can he do that?

01:13:22.982 --> 01:13:24.149
Is that legal?

01:13:25.568 --> 01:13:26.985
JEFF: You might want to close that window.

01:14:13.574 --> 01:14:15.450
Hi, Moses. It's okay.

01:14:15.535 --> 01:14:17.786
It's Nick, from Harbor Street.

01:14:20.206 --> 01:14:21.915
You need anything?

Standing like some ghoul.

You're lucky I realized it
was you. Otherwise, bamo!

01:16:10.107 --> 01:16:11.566
Right. Bamo.

01:16:12.151 --> 01:16:14.194
Are you here in your professional
capacity?

01:16:17.573 --> 01:16:19.241
to carry them to the Harbor Street palace?

A haven for homos?

01:16:20.493 --> 01:16:22.410
I'm working tonight, yes.

01:16:22.495 --> 01:16:23.495
Come on.

01:16:24.497 --> 01:16:25.580
Come on, what?

01:16:25.665 --> 01:16:27.666
Come on, it's freezing out here tonight.

01:16:28.167 --> 01:16:30.543
Freezing? I don't feel it.

01:16:31.796 --> 01:16:35.757
So, they have come to me with their
tails between their legs, huh?

01:16:35.841 --> 01:16:37.634
You know what I say?

01:16:37.969 --> 01:16:42.305
Fuck them.

01:16:43.182 --> 01:16:45.183
Up yours, Harbor Street.

01:16:48.354 --> 01:16:51.064
You are still barred from Harbor Street.

01:16:57.238 --> 01:16:59.572
I think I have been here before.

01:17:00.241 --> 01:17:03.535
Yeah, I was mugged here once by a bunch
of mother-raping drug addicts.

01:17:03.619 --> 01:17:04.619
Thanks, Jeff.

01:17:04.704 --> 01:17:05.704
Good luck.

Christ, don't tell me you live here.

01:17:10.543 --> 01:17:12.294
A fucking hellhole.

01:17:16.340 --> 01:17:20.051
I'll have a vodka screwdriver, please.

01:17:21.220 --> 01:17:22.554
There is no liquor here.

01:17:22.638 --> 01:17:24.389
No vodka? No vodka.

01:17:24.473 --> 01:17:26.099
No vodka.

01:17:27.393 --> 01:17:29.686
Fine, it's evil shit anyway.

You know, I'm putting some money aside.

I'm going to get my life back together.

01:17:37.820 --> 01:17:39.863
I got a friend in Florida.

waiting for me in St. Petersburg.

01:17:44.702 --> 01:17:45.869

01:17:54.420 --> 01:17:55.920
No. No.

01:17:56.005 --> 01:17:58.173
That's a terrible thing to say,

01:17:58.257 --> 01:17:59.632
you don't believe your own father.

01:17:59.717 --> 01:18:01.926
I'm going upstairs, go to bed.

01:18:03.054 --> 01:18:04.929
My roommates are away for the weekend.

01:18:05.014 --> 01:18:07.515
You will be unbarred in a few days,

01:18:07.600 --> 01:18:09.601

Until you go back to Harbor Street...

01:18:11.937 --> 01:18:14.105
Oh, no, I'm never going back
to that fucking place.

01:18:15.274 --> 01:18:16.358
Never.

01:18:17.109 --> 01:18:20.779
Oh, no.

01:18:24.450 --> 01:18:25.533
Hey, don't drink in here.

01:18:25.618 --> 01:18:27.577
You know, I have been thinking
about your beautiful mother

01:18:27.661 --> 01:18:28.703
and her non-accident.

01:18:28.788 --> 01:18:31.998
And I have been thinking, why would
she do something like that?

01:18:34.835 --> 01:18:35.919
Ah!

01:18:36.670 --> 01:18:38.546
Do you want a drink? No.

01:18:38.631 --> 01:18:40.715
Oh, right. You prefer the other stuff.

01:18:40.800 --> 01:18:42.509
I think I have a problem with both.

01:18:42.593 --> 01:18:44.010
A problem?

01:18:44.762 --> 01:18:46.304
Oh, I feel for you.

01:18:47.181 --> 01:18:49.099
It must be problematic.

01:18:55.689 --> 01:18:58.817
The night she did it, she
read something I wrote.

01:18:59.860 --> 01:19:01.986
A story, she thought it was about her.

01:19:02.071 --> 01:19:03.405
Was it?

01:19:05.825 --> 01:19:06.866
Yes.

01:19:08.828 --> 01:19:11.162
It was about a woman who works two jobs

01:19:11.247 --> 01:19:13.748
and tries to fit in a couple of hours

01:19:13.833 --> 01:19:15.750
between each to be with her kid.

01:19:17.920 --> 01:19:19.879
She works as a bank teller.

01:19:19.964 --> 01:19:21.923
She works as a waitress.

01:19:22.633 --> 01:19:24.259
She comes home and waits on the kid.

01:19:34.812 --> 01:19:37.939
I wasn't finished with the story.

01:19:40.109 --> 01:19:43.194
I was going to write how
the kid appreciated it,

01:19:43.279 --> 01:19:45.530
whatever time she had for him.

01:19:47.116 --> 01:19:49.701
He didn't think she was a bad mother.

01:19:51.579 --> 01:19:53.455
And he loved her.

01:19:55.082 --> 01:19:56.833
She was all he had.

01:20:01.213 --> 01:20:03.214
I didn't write that part.

01:20:05.718 --> 01:20:07.218
I didn't get that far.

01:20:07.428 --> 01:20:09.554
So that's the story you tell

01:20:10.347 --> 01:20:11.723
of why your mother killed herself.

01:20:12.016 --> 01:20:13.224
I haven't told it to anyone.

01:20:13.309 --> 01:20:15.727
You tell it to yourself. Those
are the best stories.

01:20:17.646 --> 01:20:19.439
It's a good yarn.

01:20:19.523 --> 01:20:22.317
There is only one part that's horseshit.

01:20:22.735 --> 01:20:25.653
No one kills themselves because
they read a story.

01:20:25.738 --> 01:20:27.489
I don't care how good a writer you are,

01:20:27.573 --> 01:20:30.241
you can't kill someone with words.

01:20:31.994 --> 01:20:33.578
I have a theory.

01:20:34.663 --> 01:20:36.331
The reason people commit suicide

01:20:36.415 --> 01:20:38.500
is because they don't like themselves.

01:20:38.584 --> 01:20:39.959
Self-hatred.

01:20:41.462 --> 01:20:45.048
I think it's a very reasonable
explanation. Don't you?

01:20:45.508 --> 01:20:46.508
Self-hatred?

01:20:46.592 --> 01:20:48.134
You're familiar with the concept?

01:20:49.512 --> 01:20:50.595
Yes.

01:20:53.307 --> 01:20:54.641
Of course,

01:20:55.226 --> 01:20:58.645
maybe the question isn't why she
killed herself when she did,

01:20:58.729 --> 01:21:01.689
but why she chose to stick
around as long as she did.

01:21:13.536 --> 01:21:16.329
Anyway, my writing is
going extremely well.

01:21:16.413 --> 01:21:18.122
The book's classic.

01:21:21.043 --> 01:21:24.003
And to answer your previous
question, it does exist.

01:21:24.755 --> 01:21:25.838
As do you.

01:21:25.923 --> 01:21:26.965
Why?

01:21:27.049 --> 01:21:29.926
Because of me. Because I made you.

01:21:34.974 --> 01:21:36.975
I'm going to go to sleep.

01:21:37.851 --> 01:21:39.978
The blanket's on the couch.

They are holding one for me just in case
I ever want to drop by and use it.

01:23:06.565 --> 01:23:08.691
I gotta get going. I'll be late
for the slave traders,

01:23:08.776 --> 01:23:10.360
all the jobs will be taken.

01:23:10.527 --> 01:23:11.653
Well, are you coming back?

01:23:11.737 --> 01:23:13.154
Coming back where? Here.

01:23:19.620 --> 01:23:20.662
Out of curiosity,

01:23:20.746 --> 01:23:23.164
why have you not ever asked
me to stay with you before?

01:23:25.250 --> 01:23:29.462
I thought if you try and save a drowning
man you might go down, too.

01:23:32.675 --> 01:23:36.928
A drowning man?

01:23:37.429 --> 01:23:39.430
I'm not a drowning man.

Luckily for you, you are my
son, so you are one, too!

are not me, Nicholas Flynn!

but you are not me!

I guess not.

stay here for a while?

01:24:59.970 --> 01:25:01.929
Yeah. I'm not done yet.

01:25:04.641 --> 01:25:06.601
I just wanted to say I'm sorry.

01:25:07.478 --> 01:25:08.728
For what?

01:25:10.606 --> 01:25:12.356
About your brother.

01:25:13.400 --> 01:25:14.484
Oh.

01:25:16.737 --> 01:25:18.070
Thank you.

01:25:32.044 --> 01:25:33.085
Take care of yourself.

01:25:34.338 --> 01:25:35.588
You, too.

01:25:39.927 --> 01:25:41.344
NICK: I go back to school,

01:25:41.428 --> 01:25:44.555
finish my undergraduate
degree, get my diploma.

01:25:44.932 --> 01:25:46.724
I take a poetry workshop.

01:25:47.768 --> 01:25:52.063
I work in Harlem and Crown Heights
and the South Bronx, teaching.

01:25:52.815 --> 01:25:55.483
In some schools, half the kids
I work with live in shelters.

01:25:55.567 --> 01:26:00.947
So, when Lucille Clifton says, "Her
eyes are animals," what is that?

01:26:01.907 --> 01:26:03.616
STUDENTS: An image. An image.

01:26:03.700 --> 01:26:05.952
Good, but what kind of image?

01:26:06.036 --> 01:26:07.161
STUDENTS: A metaphor.

01:26:07.246 --> 01:26:08.329
A metaphor.

01:26:08.413 --> 01:26:10.748
And what do you think she is trying
to say about her eyes?

01:26:10.833 --> 01:26:12.583
My father's letters follow me.

01:26:12.668 --> 01:26:14.460
JONATHAN: Nicky Nu-nu, you
will be happy to know

01:26:14.545 --> 01:26:17.171
my writing is doing extraordinarily well.

01:26:17.256 --> 01:26:19.882
Soon, very soon, I shall be known.

01:26:26.265 --> 01:26:28.266
NICK: Within a year, Jonathan
qualifies for

01:26:28.350 --> 01:26:30.810
an apartment, Section 8, subsidized.

01:26:31.311 --> 01:26:33.396
Unbeknownst to me, some strings have been

01:26:33.480 --> 01:26:36.065
pulled by people I once worked with.

01:27:13.645 --> 01:27:14.729
JONATHAN: Yeah?

01:27:14.813 --> 01:27:15.813
It's Nick.

01:27:15.898 --> 01:27:16.939
Nick who?

01:27:17.107 --> 01:27:18.774
Nicky Nu-nu.

01:27:18.901 --> 01:27:20.067
Oh.

01:27:20.235 --> 01:27:21.694
Nicky Nu-nu.

01:27:22.696 --> 01:27:25.156
Just want to make sure it's you.

01:27:27.868 --> 01:27:30.244
You never know what lurks
in this neighborhood.

01:27:30.329 --> 01:27:32.413
How are you?

01:27:32.497 --> 01:27:35.875
Shake my hand properly. Give
me a firm handshake.

01:27:36.668 --> 01:27:37.710
That's better.

01:27:37.794 --> 01:27:39.337
Don't break it.

01:27:40.839 --> 01:27:42.214
You're dressed, that's good.

01:27:43.717 --> 01:27:45.092
Well, the place is nice.

01:27:46.219 --> 01:27:47.470
JONATHAN: Yeah.

01:27:48.513 --> 01:27:49.931
This is my little paradise.

01:27:50.015 --> 01:27:51.349
My little oasis.

01:27:51.433 --> 01:27:53.392
My little home away from

01:27:53.977 --> 01:27:55.478
my little home.

01:27:55.562 --> 01:27:57.355
Well, I'm impressed.

01:27:57.439 --> 01:28:00.775
I'm very tranquil, I'm peaceful...

01:28:00.859 --> 01:28:04.612
NICK: Pretty soon he launches into
a familiar flurry of hate speech.

01:28:04.696 --> 01:28:07.448
...young girls being raped, day and night,

01:28:07.532 --> 01:28:10.952
by these bastards, these pederasts,

01:28:11.036 --> 01:28:15.331
these fucking priests, these
cretins, these homos.

01:28:15.707 --> 01:28:17.124
Believe me, I know all about it.

01:28:17.209 --> 01:28:20.962
I wasn't locked up in federal
prison with choirboys, kiddo.

01:28:21.046 --> 01:28:24.548
Interstate transportation
of stolen securities,

01:28:25.050 --> 01:28:26.384
that was the charge.

01:28:26.468 --> 01:28:29.512
The checking business brought to you
by the great Dippity-Do Doyle.

01:28:29.596 --> 01:28:31.889
If I didn't do what he said, he would
have killed you and your mother.

01:28:31.974 --> 01:28:33.057
Believe me, kiddo.

01:28:33.141 --> 01:28:34.433
I have trouble focusing,

01:28:34.518 --> 01:28:35.643
I consider leaving quickly,

01:28:35.727 --> 01:28:37.144
but I will myself to stay.

01:28:37.229 --> 01:28:40.898
My job was to enter the banks
and open an account.

01:28:41.650 --> 01:28:43.776
I was the only one able
to finesse my way in.

01:28:43.860 --> 01:28:46.070
The secret? The secret?

01:28:46.905 --> 01:28:48.572
Always go to a female teller.

01:28:49.408 --> 01:28:52.618
A black? Forget about the fucking
blacks. Low fucking morale.

01:28:52.703 --> 01:28:56.914
Go to them? I couldn't get on fucking
first base with a black teller.

01:28:56.999 --> 01:29:00.501
It's early in the month, so he hasn't gone
through his disability check yet.

01:29:00.585 --> 01:29:02.003
This means he has been drinking.

01:29:02.087 --> 01:29:04.922
...good Russian vodka.
Not that rotgut crap.

01:29:06.925 --> 01:29:08.009
Want some?

01:29:08.093 --> 01:29:09.093
Uh, no thanks.

01:29:11.596 --> 01:29:12.596
New teeth?

01:29:13.056 --> 01:29:14.056
Huh?

01:29:14.141 --> 01:29:15.766
You got some new teeth. Yep.

01:29:15.851 --> 01:29:19.061
Courtesy of Uncle Sam. Best
dentist in the world.

01:29:20.522 --> 01:29:21.814
Looks nice.

01:29:21.898 --> 01:29:24.108
Here, I brought you something.

01:29:26.403 --> 01:29:28.362
What the hell is this?

01:29:28.447 --> 01:29:29.530
It's a book of poems.

01:29:29.614 --> 01:29:30.656
Poems.

01:29:31.158 --> 01:29:32.825
I wrote it.

01:29:32.909 --> 01:29:34.160
Actually, it's getting an award.

01:29:34.244 --> 01:29:35.661
An award, from whom?

01:29:35.746 --> 01:29:37.705
From Penn. Penn.

01:29:38.123 --> 01:29:40.124
Are they giving you a pen?

01:29:44.588 --> 01:29:46.213
Is it dedicated to me?

01:29:46.923 --> 01:29:48.549
No. No?

01:29:48.633 --> 01:29:50.217
Am I in it?

01:29:50.302 --> 01:29:52.136
There are some poems that refer to you.

01:29:52.345 --> 01:29:54.305
Oh. Let's see.

01:29:58.894 --> 01:30:03.814
"I'll bend each finger back
Until the bottle falls

01:30:03.982 --> 01:30:06.400
"Until the bone snaps

01:30:06.485 --> 01:30:09.236
"Save him by destroying his hands"

01:30:09.738 --> 01:30:12.114
Do I detect a touch of hostility?

01:30:12.199 --> 01:30:15.409
I'm doing a reading of it
tonight at a book store.

01:30:16.578 --> 01:30:19.163
You can come, if you would like to.

01:30:24.002 --> 01:30:25.461
All right, all right.

01:30:27.297 --> 01:30:29.048
I'm going to let you read it.

01:30:29.132 --> 01:30:30.758
Your book? Yeah, The Button Man,

01:30:30.842 --> 01:30:34.178
also known as The Confessions
of Christopher Cobb.

01:30:35.180 --> 01:30:36.597
You mean it actually exists?

01:30:36.723 --> 01:30:38.140
Of course it exists.

01:30:39.101 --> 01:30:40.267
Where the fuck is it?

01:30:40.352 --> 01:30:41.852
It's somewhere here.

01:30:41.937 --> 01:30:45.439
Give me a hand here, look in these
boxes. Look for a blue folder.

01:30:58.411 --> 01:30:59.912
I think I may have it here.

01:30:59.996 --> 01:31:01.622
Yeah. This is it.

01:31:07.087 --> 01:31:08.921
Here it is, part one.

01:31:09.881 --> 01:31:12.341
This is part one? How
many parts are there?

01:31:12.425 --> 01:31:14.552
12. Eight are in existence.

01:31:17.389 --> 01:31:19.765
"Clink, clank, clunk. I
think that I am drunk."

01:31:19.850 --> 01:31:23.978
Don't read it here, for Christ's
sake. That part's a musical.

01:31:24.062 --> 01:31:26.897
I will read it right away
and get it back to you.

01:31:26.982 --> 01:31:28.232
Don't steal anything.

01:31:29.067 --> 01:31:30.401
I promise.

01:31:32.028 --> 01:31:34.196
NICK: I read his book in one afternoon.

01:31:34.281 --> 01:31:35.865
JONATHAN: It's a masterpiece.

01:31:36.658 --> 01:31:38.033
I read your poems.

01:31:38.118 --> 01:31:39.577
That one about the gun is heavy.

01:31:39.661 --> 01:31:41.829
Of course it's an inherited quality.

01:31:41.913 --> 01:31:43.914
If you didn't write well,
I would be surprised.

01:31:43.999 --> 01:31:46.250
For 30 pages it shows promise.

01:31:46.668 --> 01:31:48.919
Then like his life, it soon falls apart

01:31:49.004 --> 01:31:51.255
and dissipates into incoherence.

01:31:52.257 --> 01:31:54.383
His manuscript is incomplete.

01:31:54.801 --> 01:31:56.343
As far as I can tell,

01:31:56.636 --> 01:31:58.470
the only completed book about my father

01:31:58.555 --> 01:32:01.015
would be the book that
fell to me to write.

01:32:01.099 --> 01:32:06.478
Me, my father's un-credited,
uncompliant ghost writer.

01:32:07.439 --> 01:32:08.898
I've been in touch with Little, Brown.

01:32:08.982 --> 01:32:11.483
They are doing my book. Four
million dollars in advance.

01:32:12.944 --> 01:32:15.613
Little, Brown said my
book's a masterpiece.

01:32:15.697 --> 01:32:18.240
Everything I write is a masterpiece.

01:32:21.286 --> 01:32:24.038
"The eyes of the action hero
cut from the poster

01:32:24.122 --> 01:32:26.665
"All that concrete pressing down

01:32:26.750 --> 01:32:29.460
"A fine edge gleams around your body

01:32:30.879 --> 01:32:33.088
"As if it could be contained

01:32:38.929 --> 01:32:43.432
"The way each finger is licked, dipped
in and rubbed across the gums

01:32:44.100 --> 01:32:45.809
"Until the teeth go away

01:32:46.436 --> 01:32:47.728
"Even my hands kiss you

01:32:49.147 --> 01:32:51.649
"A night broken down into grains

01:32:52.484 --> 01:32:54.860
"If you find yourself lost, dig

01:32:55.570 --> 01:32:57.821
"A cave in the snow, quickly

01:32:57.906 --> 01:33:00.449
"You need shelter against the night

01:33:00.825 --> 01:33:03.118
"A candle could keep you alive

01:33:03.203 --> 01:33:07.081
"The engine of your lungs will
heat the air around you

01:33:07.165 --> 01:33:09.208
"Someone will miss you

01:33:09.292 --> 01:33:11.293
"They will send out dogs

01:33:12.504 --> 01:33:14.838
"You must be somewhere, right?"

01:33:21.179 --> 01:33:22.596
Thank you.

01:33:25.642 --> 01:33:27.101
There you go.

01:33:27.602 --> 01:33:29.645
Thanks. Thanks for coming.

01:33:36.695 --> 01:33:37.820
Hey. Hey.

01:33:38.363 --> 01:33:39.571
Uh, he's here.

01:33:41.825 --> 01:33:45.035
Jonathan, this is Inez.
Inez, this is Jonathan.

01:33:45.120 --> 01:33:46.996
A very great pleasure.

01:33:47.539 --> 01:33:48.622
It's good to meet you.

01:33:48.707 --> 01:33:51.583
And this is Maeve, your granddaughter.

01:33:54.296 --> 01:33:55.546
Would you like to hold her?

01:33:55.672 --> 01:33:56.922
Uh, that's okay.

01:33:57.132 --> 01:33:58.299
No, he can hold her.

01:33:58.550 --> 01:34:00.301
I have held babies before, Nicholas.

01:34:07.183 --> 01:34:08.267
See?

01:34:08.476 --> 01:34:09.601
(CRYING)

01:34:11.021 --> 01:34:12.146
See?

01:34:14.733 --> 01:34:15.858
(CRYING)

01:34:16.276 --> 01:34:23.991
See?

01:34:24.909 --> 01:34:26.118
Yeah, I see.

01:34:32.959 --> 01:34:34.918
JONATHAN: All right, Nicholas,
you can have it.

01:34:35.628 --> 01:34:37.421
I bequeath it to you.

01:34:39.257 --> 01:34:41.175
You have the last word.
