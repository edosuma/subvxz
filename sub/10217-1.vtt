00:03.462 --> 00:06.172
4:22 on
a sunny Thursday afternoon here...

00:06.382 --> 00:08.007
...in Chicago, on K-LITE.

00:08.217 --> 00:10.927
Now, here's one for all you
rush-hour rockers.

00:11.136 --> 00:14.555
The Beach Boys with "Good Vibrations."

01:10.696 --> 01:12.029
Hey, Mr. Griswold.

01:14.491 --> 01:17.535
Vegas, Vegas, Vegas!

01:37.514 --> 01:40.767
Rusty, Audrey, Ellen?

01:43.645 --> 01:46.439
Honey? I'm home.

01:48.859 --> 01:50.526
- Hi, honey.
- Oh, hi, honey.

01:50.736 --> 01:54.363
- Smells good.
- Oh, well... Don't, don't, don't!

01:54.573 --> 01:57.116
Kids, come on in here. Gather around.

01:57.326 --> 01:59.619
- I wanna show you something.
- Is it my new car?

01:59.828 --> 02:01.204
Keep dreaming, son.

02:01.413 --> 02:03.956
Here. Eat these.

02:07.294 --> 02:09.503
- They're chocolate chip.
- They're delicious.

02:09.713 --> 02:11.464
They're four years old.

02:15.969 --> 02:17.512
Anyone for milk?

02:17.721 --> 02:19.639
Eight years old.

02:20.224 --> 02:23.351
It's my long-life food preservative.
It's finally been approved.

02:23.560 --> 02:24.977
I got my big bonus.

02:26.396 --> 02:28.356
- Yeah, Dad.
- Congratulations, Daddy.

02:28.565 --> 02:29.607
Isn't it great?

02:30.609 --> 02:33.486
And that's not all.

02:33.695 --> 02:37.490
Mr. Shirley thinks a guy like
Clark Griswold deserves a few days off.

02:37.699 --> 02:40.785
A guy like Clark Griswold thinks
he should take those days off...

02:40.994 --> 02:44.872
...and take his family
on a fabulous vacation to say...

02:46.124 --> 02:49.126
...fantastic Las Vegas.

02:52.214 --> 02:54.507
Dad, Las Vegas?
There's nothing to do there.

02:54.716 --> 02:59.679
Clark, I don't think that Las Vegas
is the kind of place you take a family.

02:59.888 --> 03:01.430
Oh, come on.

03:01.640 --> 03:03.808
Las Vegas has changed, Ellen.

03:04.017 --> 03:07.436
It's the number one
family destination in America.

03:08.480 --> 03:11.399
Dad, I'm not going.
The people there are so phony.

03:11.608 --> 03:13.317
Isn't there legalized prostitution?

03:13.527 --> 03:15.152
Not within the city limits, Russ.

03:15.362 --> 03:17.071
I'll tell you what there is.

03:17.281 --> 03:20.908
There's first-class entertainment,
beautiful scenery...

03:21.118 --> 03:24.996
...and all the shrimp cocktail
you can eat.

03:26.623 --> 03:29.625
Listen, everybody. Who knows how
many more chances we'll get...

03:29.835 --> 03:31.711
...to do something together
as a family?

03:31.920 --> 03:34.297
I mean, Ellen, you and I
are always working.

03:34.506 --> 03:39.552
And you guys are growing up so fast,
I hardly recognize you anymore.

03:41.889 --> 03:45.558
Okay. There's one more reason
why you should all go.

03:48.937 --> 03:51.147
I'm gonna remarry your mom.

03:51.356 --> 03:53.357
If she'll have me.

03:53.984 --> 03:55.610
Really, Sparky?

03:56.028 --> 03:58.404
What do you say,
Russ? My 20th anniversary.

03:58.614 --> 03:59.947
I could use a best man.

04:00.908 --> 04:02.658
Have anybody in mind
for a bridesmaid?

04:02.868 --> 04:04.911
- How about Audrey?
- Audrey who?

04:05.329 --> 04:08.080
- Dad.
- What do you say? Let's do it.

04:08.290 --> 04:12.209
I think this is gonna be
the greatest vacation ever.

04:28.518 --> 04:31.479
You know you look really
beautiful right now?

04:31.688 --> 04:33.272
Oh, no.

04:38.195 --> 04:39.946
You know, honey?

04:40.155 --> 04:43.699
The guys at work tell me
there's this special club we can join...

04:44.493 --> 04:46.202
...if we meet in the bathroom.

04:47.621 --> 04:50.081
Clark, are you serious?

04:50.290 --> 04:51.999
Come on. You love me, don't you?

04:52.209 --> 04:54.085
I do, but here?

04:54.294 --> 04:55.795
Now?

04:56.088 --> 04:58.005
Well, we've been married 20 years.

05:00.258 --> 05:01.801
How do we do it?

05:02.135 --> 05:04.178
You go first. I'll be right behind you.

05:08.517 --> 05:09.976
Are you okay? You look all red.

05:10.185 --> 05:12.561
Yeah. Just have to go to the restroom.

05:24.908 --> 05:26.200
Excuse me.

05:26.410 --> 05:27.952
Where you going, Pop?

05:28.370 --> 05:31.330
Oh, your mother's got something
caught in her eye.

05:31.540 --> 05:35.209
Just gonna... I'm gonna help her
get it out.

06:14.207 --> 06:15.791
Ellen?

06:17.210 --> 06:18.294
Ow.

06:19.796 --> 06:23.507
Look, maybe we should join...

06:23.717 --> 06:26.510
- I don't know if this will work...
- Some other kind of club.

06:26.720 --> 06:29.305
I just want some time with you.

06:29.681 --> 06:32.349
- I just think there's...
- This is gonna be such a great vacation.

06:32.559 --> 06:34.727
- A better time to...
- This is gonna be our best one.

06:36.229 --> 06:37.980
The flight captain has...

06:38.190 --> 06:39.398
Foot. Foot. Foot.

06:39.608 --> 06:42.485
- My foot. My foot.
- I got it. I got it. I got it.

06:44.488 --> 06:46.113
I'll never fly again.

06:46.323 --> 06:48.074
I thought the pilot was very helpful.

06:48.283 --> 06:49.784
See the way the plane applauded?

06:49.993 --> 06:53.037
You know, if you two wanna use
the bathrooms here, we'll wait.

06:53.371 --> 06:54.705
Hey, is this for us?

06:54.915 --> 06:56.832
Clark. A limo?

06:57.042 --> 06:58.501
We're the Griswolds.

06:58.710 --> 07:01.420
Sorry, my pen burst in the altitude,
you know?

07:01.630 --> 07:04.632
I'm sorry, sir. Come.
Please. Come this way. Please.

07:04.841 --> 07:06.884
This is it. This is it.

07:15.393 --> 07:17.019
Would you look at this.

07:37.332 --> 07:40.000
Wayne Newton.

08:07.904 --> 08:09.572
Wow, it's beautiful.

08:12.450 --> 08:14.243
Audrey, come here.
You gotta see this.

08:21.960 --> 08:23.210
Daddy.

08:24.671 --> 08:26.380
Help. Daddy, I'm stuck.

08:26.590 --> 08:28.424
Daddy.

08:28.633 --> 08:32.178
- Vegas. Vegas. Vegas.
- Daddy!

08:46.401 --> 08:48.527
Look, everybody.
I think you should see this.

08:50.614 --> 08:52.823
Daddy. Daddy.

08:53.033 --> 08:54.491
Audrey?

09:09.633 --> 09:10.925
Is this it?

09:11.134 --> 09:14.261
- Welcome to the fabulous Mirage.
- Thank you.

09:17.474 --> 09:21.060
Oh, don't worry, Audrey.
It won't leave a permanent line.

09:21.937 --> 09:24.355
Come on, come on, come on!
There's a lot to do.

09:24.564 --> 09:26.690
There's a lot to do.

09:32.280 --> 09:34.198
Welcome to the Mirage.
Your credit card?

09:34.407 --> 09:36.367
Yes, indeedy. Clark W. Griswold. Four.

09:36.952 --> 09:38.869
We have excellent
dry-cleaning service...

09:39.079 --> 09:42.248
...if you're so inclined.
- Oh, it's just a birthmark.

09:44.793 --> 09:48.254
Now, in order to get to your rooms,
go this way through the casino.

09:48.463 --> 09:52.132
Veer to the left. Take a sharp right
at the first giant palm tree.

09:52.342 --> 09:56.345
You'll see a group of blackjack tables.
Not baccarat, not craps. Blackjack.

09:56.554 --> 09:58.764
Take another right
and then wind around left.

09:58.974 --> 10:01.558
If you get to the pool,
you've gone too far. Back up.

10:01.768 --> 10:05.896
You'll see a bank of elevators.
They aren't yours. Stay away from them.

10:06.106 --> 10:09.233
Keep walking. You'll see another bank
of elevators. The gold ones.

10:09.442 --> 10:12.152
Go to the tenth floor.
Go right at the end of the hallway.

10:12.362 --> 10:13.988
You'll find your room.

10:14.739 --> 10:16.156
Any questions?

10:17.575 --> 10:19.827
No. Not really.

10:20.203 --> 10:21.537
- Russ.
- Yeah, Dad?

10:21.746 --> 10:24.081
Oh, there you are. Did you get that?

10:24.833 --> 10:27.960
Well, let's go then. Thanks.

10:30.755 --> 10:32.631
Good luck.

10:44.227 --> 10:45.853
What's this?

10:48.732 --> 10:50.024
Look at these people.

10:50.233 --> 10:53.110
Blinded by glitter
and the almighty dollar.

11:17.385 --> 11:18.844
Clark, the elevators are there.

11:19.054 --> 11:20.679
Hold on, honey.

11:20.889 --> 11:24.141
They always put the machines
that pay off the most right in front.

11:24.351 --> 11:27.394
- Five dollars, Clark?
- Five dollars. Here we go.

11:36.863 --> 11:41.784
You see? Las Vegas is already
bringing us closer together.

11:41.993 --> 11:44.036
Let's go to the room.

11:47.123 --> 11:49.375
Honey, call up the kids.

11:49.584 --> 11:51.001
See how they like this.

11:56.424 --> 11:59.718
Rusty and Audrey Griswold, please.

12:09.396 --> 12:11.688
Mom, we're next door.
Can't we get our own rooms?

12:11.898 --> 12:14.441
Honey, please don't spoil
your daddy's fun.

12:14.651 --> 12:16.276
Dad, we're too old for this.

12:17.821 --> 12:19.947
Hey, hey, hey.

12:20.156 --> 12:21.657
Come on.

12:21.866 --> 12:23.617
Sit down.

12:24.577 --> 12:27.788
Kids, remember
when you were babies?

12:28.498 --> 12:29.832
No.

12:30.291 --> 12:32.126
It was a wonderful time.

12:32.877 --> 12:34.837
We had your cribs right in our bedroom.

12:35.046 --> 12:37.631
Then we'd wrap you up in those
little baby blankets...

12:37.841 --> 12:42.386
...and roll you back and forth
across the bed into each other.

12:43.221 --> 12:46.682
Those days are...
Well, they're almost over.

12:48.560 --> 12:52.020
So to close out that
wonderful chapter in our lives...

12:52.230 --> 12:55.357
...I got us four tickets
to Siegfried and Roy.

12:55.567 --> 12:56.984
Number one show on the planet.

12:57.193 --> 12:58.777
"Masters of the Impossible."

12:58.987 --> 13:00.696
Yeah. And we're all going.

13:00.905 --> 13:02.281
Because we're the Griswolds.

13:02.490 --> 13:06.076
Can't you just wrap me up in a blanket
and roll me across the bed again?

13:06.286 --> 13:08.287
No, Russ. Get dressed.

13:15.879 --> 13:18.589
Hey. Wanna try our hand
at a little blackjack?

13:18.798 --> 13:21.800
What do you know
about blackjack, Clark?

13:22.010 --> 13:25.095
Honey, did you forget
I was in the Army?

13:25.597 --> 13:27.764
You weren't in the Army, Clark.

13:27.974 --> 13:31.852
Well, not in the Army, but I have played
cards with men in uniform.

13:33.021 --> 13:36.148
Just don't want you to lose
all your money. That's all.

13:36.441 --> 13:39.943
When a man can come to Las Vegas
with a few extra bucks in his pocket...

13:40.153 --> 13:43.530
...maybe throw a ten-spot
down on a table...

13:43.740 --> 13:46.700
...pay an extra dollar
for a steak with his eggs...

13:46.910 --> 13:48.785
...that's a happy day for that man.

13:48.995 --> 13:50.913
And when his woman is at his side...

13:51.122 --> 13:52.456
Ellen?

13:53.416 --> 13:55.709
Is that Wayne Newton?

13:56.044 --> 13:57.920
I suppose it is. Why?
Want his autograph?

13:58.129 --> 14:00.005
I think he's staring at me.

14:02.342 --> 14:06.094
No. No, I... I must be tired.
Maybe I'll go find the kids.

14:06.304 --> 14:10.516
No. I think they want a little time
away from mama and papa bear.

14:10.725 --> 14:12.976
Let's let them get into some trouble.

14:13.561 --> 14:15.604
- Rusty.
- Audrey, I'm asking for five bucks.

14:15.813 --> 14:17.481
What'll you do if you win?
Run away?

14:17.690 --> 14:19.816
You're the most boring person
to travel with.

14:20.026 --> 14:22.486
Fine. You want five bucks?
Here. Here, big man.

14:22.695 --> 14:24.571
- Here's five bucks.
- Thank you.

14:24.781 --> 14:26.865
- Get a wallet.
- Jeez.

14:29.244 --> 14:31.411
- Hi.
- Good evening.

14:31.621 --> 14:33.622
Would the two of you have any ID?

14:33.831 --> 14:36.917
Well, you see, we left our IDs
upstairs, actually.

14:37.126 --> 14:40.337
See, we're on our honeymoon,
but if you wait here for two minutes...

14:40.547 --> 14:44.174
...I'll can run upstairs and get the ID.
I'll be right back. Okay?

14:46.844 --> 14:49.721
My friend, $200 in chips, please?

14:49.931 --> 14:52.933
Good evening. Changing 200.

14:54.727 --> 14:57.521
You know blackjack is the only
game where a smart player...

14:57.730 --> 15:00.148
...has a mathematical advantage
over the house?

15:01.067 --> 15:02.401
Are you a professional?

15:02.610 --> 15:05.320
Me? No. Not really.

15:05.738 --> 15:07.364
Are you?

15:15.540 --> 15:17.916
- Place your bet, sir.
- Yes, the bet.

15:18.126 --> 15:21.211
Okay. What the hell.

15:25.633 --> 15:27.593
- Hit me.
- It's a bust.

15:27.802 --> 15:30.762
Las Vegas Fun Police.
Hand over your chips.

15:30.972 --> 15:33.181
- Eddie?
- Twenty-two. Player busts.

15:36.436 --> 15:39.605
Oh, man. It is a blazer out there.

15:39.814 --> 15:44.276
You're lucky you got air conditioning
in here like Mother Nature intended.

15:44.485 --> 15:48.071
Clark Griswold, did you think
you were gonna get to Las Vegas...

15:48.281 --> 15:51.533
...and not see your favorite cousin, huh?
- Your bet.

15:51.743 --> 15:54.828
There you go. What are you doing
in Las Vegas, Eddie?

15:55.330 --> 15:58.665
Where else can you wear shorts
24 hours a day, huh?

15:59.542 --> 16:02.544
Whoa! I am on fire.

16:02.754 --> 16:05.172
- What?
- Shuffling.

16:05.965 --> 16:07.257
Here's the best part.

16:07.467 --> 16:09.593
Thanks to that defective plate
in my head...

16:09.802 --> 16:13.180
...the VA gave me a huge plot of
government land just north of town.

16:13.723 --> 16:17.476
Oh, yeah. Every time I belch
the plate shifts and my legs give out.

16:17.685 --> 16:20.228
But, man, what a view.

16:21.481 --> 16:23.023
Nineteen.

16:23.983 --> 16:27.402
- Twenty.
- Oh, he's good.

16:27.612 --> 16:29.196
He's good.

16:31.783 --> 16:34.993
- Another 100 in chips, please.
- Changing 100.

16:35.203 --> 16:36.745
That's it, Clark.

16:36.954 --> 16:38.372
Show them who's boss.

16:38.581 --> 16:42.334
It's people like you who blow the family
nest egg here that built this town.

16:42.543 --> 16:44.419
Not this pretty boy.

16:50.218 --> 16:51.551
Whoa!

16:53.388 --> 16:55.222
Oh, gee.

16:56.140 --> 16:58.266
I can't believe it.

16:58.476 --> 17:01.895
I've lost $300 in 15 minutes?

17:07.193 --> 17:09.903
- Hi.
- I'm okay. I'm okay.

18:03.958 --> 18:05.834
You're very kind. You're very kind.

18:06.043 --> 18:11.006
- Wow, what a great audience!
- Yeah. All right. Awesome.

18:11.424 --> 18:13.425
Terrific.

18:13.885 --> 18:17.554
- May I ask you where you come from?
- Me? Chicago, Illinois.

18:17.764 --> 18:19.806
- Fantastic. All right.
- Chicago.

18:20.475 --> 18:24.102
- Sir, why don't you come on stage?
- Oh, come on, Clark. It'll be fun.

18:24.312 --> 18:25.896
- Yeah, Dad, do it.
- No. I can't...

18:26.105 --> 18:28.899
- Go on.
- All right. I'll play along. Okay.

18:32.111 --> 18:34.321
Give him a hand.

18:34.822 --> 18:36.865
- Good to have you.
- Be comfortable.

18:37.074 --> 18:38.408
What is your name, sir?

18:39.035 --> 18:40.535
- Clark Griswold.
- Clark Griswold.

18:40.745 --> 18:41.787
Marvelous.

18:41.996 --> 18:43.663
Now, let's do some real magic.

18:43.873 --> 18:46.291
- Clark...
- Listen, I know the routine.

18:46.501 --> 18:50.170
What's it gonna be tonight?
Wires? Mirrors? Trap doors?

18:51.839 --> 18:54.007
You know, I happen to know
a little magic.

18:54.217 --> 18:56.635
I don't know if you've ever seen this.

18:58.179 --> 18:59.930
Can you tell it's my thumb, huh?

19:00.139 --> 19:02.599
Looks like my thumb, but it's not.

19:02.809 --> 19:05.268
I'll do whatever you want.
It doesn't matter to me.

19:05.603 --> 19:07.437
I'm here to help.

19:08.940 --> 19:12.150
- Enter.
- Okay. I know this one. Yeah.

19:12.360 --> 19:14.611
- Trust me.
- All right. I'll trust you.

19:16.948 --> 19:19.449
So this is going up then, huh?
I'll just go with it.

19:20.368 --> 19:21.868
Me.

19:22.495 --> 19:23.787
Great.

19:23.996 --> 19:25.622
All right.

20:22.096 --> 20:25.724
- I wonder where Dad went.
- I haven't got a clue.

21:00.259 --> 21:02.928
How'd you do at the tables last night?

21:04.847 --> 21:06.681
I'm about even.

21:09.352 --> 21:12.228
- Why'd you tell Eddie we were here?
- Oh, come on.

21:12.438 --> 21:15.982
How often do I get to see
my cousin Catherine?

21:16.359 --> 21:19.069
Anyway, we're just stopping by
for lunch.

21:19.695 --> 21:21.738
I wanna gamble.

21:23.115 --> 21:27.077
Russell, I never wanna hear
those words out of your mouth again.

21:27.286 --> 21:30.246
Gambling is a very serious business.

21:30.748 --> 21:32.582
Is that clear?

21:32.792 --> 21:34.709
Excuse me a minute.

21:57.400 --> 21:59.442
- Fifty on black, please.
- No more bets.

22:01.278 --> 22:05.991
- Red 25. Red wins.
- Jeez!

22:24.427 --> 22:26.094
Shall we?

23:15.436 --> 23:17.103
Remember me?

23:17.563 --> 23:19.230
Yes.

23:26.072 --> 23:27.822
Love you.

23:39.251 --> 23:41.086
Your baby?

23:56.310 --> 23:58.436
Are you watching for an address, Clark?

23:58.646 --> 24:01.815
- Yeah, Dad. What block are we on?
- Very funny, Russ.

24:02.024 --> 24:03.691
Honey, will you check the map again?

24:03.901 --> 24:06.027
Hey, could that be it?

24:06.570 --> 24:08.905
Well, Eddie said there was
enough room for a pool.

24:09.115 --> 24:11.407
Get out the sunscreen.

24:19.500 --> 24:21.501
Cousins.

24:21.710 --> 24:24.003
What do you think of my spread, huh?

24:24.380 --> 24:28.341
Can you believe it? They used to test
H-bombs on this beautiful property.

24:29.135 --> 24:32.095
Oh, Ellen. I missed you so much.

24:32.304 --> 24:34.222
Ellen.

24:39.478 --> 24:41.604
Eddie, don't you worry
about radiation?

24:41.814 --> 24:44.440
All I know, Clark, is my teeth
have never been whiter...

24:44.650 --> 24:48.069
...and my garden is spitting out
50-pound tomatoes.

24:48.946 --> 24:51.030
Hey, Denny boy, come on over here.

24:51.240 --> 24:53.116
Would you just look at that view?

24:53.325 --> 24:57.412
It's government property all around us,
so you know nobody's gonna build.

24:58.164 --> 24:59.998
Look at this one here.

25:01.167 --> 25:03.168
They grow up so fast, don't they?

25:03.377 --> 25:05.712
I tell him he's gonna pierce
himself shut...

25:05.921 --> 25:07.255
...but what can you do?

25:07.464 --> 25:11.676
- The boy likes eating through a straw.
- Gotta let kids make their own mistakes.

25:14.889 --> 25:15.930
Doesn't that hurt?

25:16.140 --> 25:17.182
It's not bad.

25:17.391 --> 25:18.600
Who's hungry?

25:21.520 --> 25:26.107
- You need help with the grill, Eddie?
- No, thanks, Clark. Don't have one.

25:33.449 --> 25:35.450
I'll get the tongs.

25:40.372 --> 25:43.208
Renewing your wedding vows?

25:43.417 --> 25:46.502
Oh, that's so wonderful.

25:46.712 --> 25:50.131
I wish Eddie and I had time
for that sort of thing.

25:50.341 --> 25:55.094
But with the constant windstorms
and flash floods...

25:55.304 --> 26:00.016
...oppressive heat and home schooling,
we don't have a minute free.

26:00.226 --> 26:04.103
- Could you hand me that oven mitt?
- Oh, yeah.

26:05.814 --> 26:08.066
I love what you've done
with the kitchenette.

26:08.275 --> 26:10.235
Oh, thanks. Yeah, listen...

26:10.444 --> 26:14.948
...things could be a lot worse.
- Yeah. You could be pregnant again.

26:18.953 --> 26:20.703
Oh, no.

26:20.913 --> 26:24.874
I've been earning money
testing fertility drugs.

26:25.084 --> 26:27.585
And I think this one's
gonna be a winner.

26:28.462 --> 26:30.922
Everybody loves a baby.

26:33.050 --> 26:34.592
Yeah. Life is good.

26:34.802 --> 26:36.636
My kids are thriving.

26:36.845 --> 26:39.806
Little Ruby-Sue must have grown
a foot since you saw her last.

26:40.015 --> 26:43.685
- Daddy, Daddy, I caught another snake.
- That's good, sweetheart.

26:43.894 --> 26:45.937
Go put it in the pit
with the other ones.

26:46.146 --> 26:48.439
And get inside and work on
your typing.

26:52.361 --> 26:53.945
Nice kids, Eddie.

26:55.614 --> 26:58.032
Don't ever pick me up again.

26:58.242 --> 26:59.784
Jerk.

27:03.580 --> 27:05.915
Look who's home.

27:06.208 --> 27:08.584
This one here's my pride and joy.

27:10.796 --> 27:13.631
Lord is my witness, I hate this heat.

27:13.841 --> 27:15.800
If it ain't gluing your butt
to the seat...

27:16.010 --> 27:18.094
...it's making you sweat
like a farm animal.

27:18.304 --> 27:20.847
And I want something better!

27:21.515 --> 27:23.141
Hey, everybody.

27:23.809 --> 27:27.770
You remember your cousin Vickie,
don't you, Russ? She's a dancer now.

27:27.980 --> 27:29.314
Her picture's everywhere.

27:29.732 --> 27:32.150
Phone booths, men's rooms.

27:32.359 --> 27:33.651
She's famous.

27:33.861 --> 27:36.988
Show them that little move
I taught you there, pork chop.

27:48.917 --> 27:52.462
Don't think unnatural thoughts
about your cousin, Russ.

27:58.719 --> 28:01.637
She's got her mama's looks
and her daddy's sense of balance.

28:01.847 --> 28:04.682
Hose down, now, kids.
Chicken's almost ready.

28:04.892 --> 28:08.811
- How's your chicken? Mine's dry as hell.
- Mine's dry as hell too.

28:09.021 --> 28:12.065
You wanna hang with me tonight,
I'll give you my beeper number.

28:12.274 --> 28:15.026
Really? That would be great.

28:15.527 --> 28:18.821
If you're still hungry, I can wrestle
the potato salad from the dog.

28:19.031 --> 28:21.741
As appealing as that sounds, Eddie,
we should be going.

28:21.950 --> 28:25.244
Still got a lot of sightseeing,
and I added tetanus shot to the list.

28:25.454 --> 28:26.996
Sorry about the tablecloth.

28:27.206 --> 28:29.874
Rusty's never had
this reaction to poultry before.

28:30.793 --> 28:33.586
He just ain't used to real home cooking.
Are you, tiger?

28:33.796 --> 28:35.380
Eddie.

28:35.589 --> 28:39.926
- Eddie, he's sick. Anyway, I...
- He'll be all right.

28:40.135 --> 28:43.096
Wish you and Catherine could come,
but no room for the kids.

28:43.305 --> 28:46.391
- So thanks for the lunch, and bye.
- Not so fast, Clark.

28:46.725 --> 28:48.142
Let me get the babysitter.

28:52.064 --> 28:56.025
Hey, kids. Roundup time.

29:01.115 --> 29:03.032
That'll keep them busy for hours.

29:03.534 --> 29:04.867
Where are we going?

29:06.662 --> 29:12.041
Hoover Dam. Over 1000
feet wide, and 727 feet to the bottom.

29:12.251 --> 29:13.626
Where can I buy some bait?

29:13.836 --> 29:18.089
Oh, I love electricity.
Eddie says we're gonna get some soon.

29:18.298 --> 29:20.425
What a magnificent achievement.

29:21.468 --> 29:25.263
Clark, this is a family vacation.
Could you try to stay with the family?

29:25.472 --> 29:26.806
Oh, I'm sorry, honey.

29:27.015 --> 29:30.560
This way, please.
The tour is about to start.

29:32.479 --> 29:34.021
Welcome, everyone.

29:34.231 --> 29:36.315
I am your dam guide, Arnie.

29:36.817 --> 29:40.903
Now, I'm about to take you through
a fully functioning power plant.

29:41.488 --> 29:45.867
So please, no one wander off
the dam tour.

29:46.076 --> 29:49.287
And please, take all
the dam pictures you want.

29:49.496 --> 29:51.456
Now, are there any dam questions?

29:52.249 --> 29:54.125
Yeah. Where can I get some damn bait?

29:54.334 --> 29:55.668
Eddie.

29:56.920 --> 29:58.963
This way, please.

30:00.215 --> 30:01.716
What did he say?

30:01.925 --> 30:03.718
"This way."

30:04.595 --> 30:08.639
Don't worry about water leaking through
the rocks, folks. It's perfectly normal.

30:08.849 --> 30:11.309
Please, keep up with the tour.

30:14.396 --> 30:18.065
This is one of the oldest
dam tunnels we have.

30:19.485 --> 30:21.652
Audrey. Audrey, come here.

30:23.906 --> 30:25.198
Give me your gum.

30:25.407 --> 30:27.950
- Out of my mouth?
- I don't care. Any gum. Give me gum.

30:28.160 --> 30:29.952
- Look what's happening here.
- Here.

30:30.162 --> 30:31.787
Just tell them I'll catch up.

30:40.672 --> 30:43.633
Yeah... Yeah.

30:56.480 --> 30:58.189
Damn it.

31:15.958 --> 31:17.792
Hello?

31:20.045 --> 31:22.380
Ellen? Russ?

31:23.715 --> 31:26.008
Where the hell is the damn dam tour?

31:29.096 --> 31:31.597
Oh, boy. Oh, boy. Oh, boy.

31:36.311 --> 31:37.895
Ellen?

31:46.863 --> 31:51.242
And there are over 100 million tons
of cement in these walls.

31:53.662 --> 31:55.413
Ellen?

31:56.081 --> 31:59.458
Hello? Hello? Help.

32:20.772 --> 32:22.857
It's not that high.

32:34.870 --> 32:36.245
Okay. Here we go.

32:36.455 --> 32:38.414
Let's see if I still got it.

32:48.050 --> 32:50.259
Nice breeze up here.

32:53.013 --> 32:55.056
And that's
how a power plant works.

32:55.265 --> 32:57.266
How?

33:06.318 --> 33:08.986
This tour gets better every week.

33:09.196 --> 33:10.946
- Fishing's been better, though.
- Yeah.

33:11.156 --> 33:12.865
Remember when I had the puffer fish?

33:39.935 --> 33:42.103
Just like in gym class.

33:42.312 --> 33:43.896
One hand at a time.

33:49.528 --> 33:53.114
- Ellen!
- What was that?

34:03.291 --> 34:06.752
- Oh, my God. Clark!
- Daddy!

34:06.962 --> 34:09.130
- Sorry, honey. I'll be right up.
- Daddy.

34:09.339 --> 34:12.007
- Daddy.
- Clark.

34:12.300 --> 34:13.634
Clark?

34:13.844 --> 34:15.177
This is steep.

34:15.762 --> 34:17.429
Okay. Here we go.

34:30.444 --> 34:32.445
- I got it.
- Need some help, Clark?

34:32.654 --> 34:34.321
No. I got it.

34:36.699 --> 34:40.578
That's a workout there, isn't it?
Climbed all the way up there.

34:42.080 --> 34:44.248
- I almost lost my tag.
- Clark.

34:44.458 --> 34:47.251
Drinks at the Snacketeria, on me.

35:13.487 --> 35:18.282
I can't help noticing you're taking more
of an interest in the fairer sex lately.

35:18.492 --> 35:21.952
There's something your old dad
would like to say about that:

35:22.162 --> 35:26.624
You see, Russ, there comes a time
in every young man's life...

35:26.833 --> 35:28.542
...when he enters...

35:28.752 --> 35:32.129
...the fragrant garden
of beautiful flowers.

35:32.339 --> 35:37.259
And he wants to enter that garden
with a knowledge and a mulch...

35:37.469 --> 35:41.680
...to let the flowers bloom
more brightly, rather than...

35:41.890 --> 35:43.766
- Dad.
- What?

35:44.184 --> 35:46.644
If this is about sex, I already know.

35:47.479 --> 35:50.314
- You do?
- Yeah.

35:50.524 --> 35:51.816
Oh.

35:54.820 --> 35:56.445
Good talk, son.

35:57.781 --> 36:00.574
So, what's it gonna be tonight?
"The Amazing Elvis Monkeys"?

36:00.784 --> 36:03.536
- How about "Liberace on Ice"?
- Oh, Clark, I don't' know.

36:03.745 --> 36:05.162
It's been such a long day.

36:06.665 --> 36:08.082
At Hoover Dam today...

36:08.291 --> 36:11.794
...the water level dropped four feet
after an unexplained flood...

36:12.003 --> 36:13.796
Oh, thank you.

36:16.591 --> 36:18.133
Hey, look at this.

36:18.343 --> 36:20.386
Four tickets to Wayne Newton.

36:21.054 --> 36:25.891
Wayne Newton?

36:27.352 --> 36:29.311
That's Las Vegas,
they never stop giving.

36:29.521 --> 36:31.188
- Yeah?
- Hi. For Ellen Griswold.

36:31.606 --> 36:34.567
- I'm Mr. Ellen Griswold. Thank you.
- Okay.

36:45.495 --> 36:49.665
"Please wear this tonight. A friend."

36:50.458 --> 36:51.792
Hey, who's it from, Mom?

36:52.586 --> 36:55.129
I don't know.

36:55.338 --> 36:57.798
But it's beautiful.

36:59.926 --> 37:03.053
I guess they really know
how to treat their high rollers.

37:03.513 --> 37:06.849
Okay, kids. Inspection in five minutes.

37:07.350 --> 37:10.060
You heard your father. Move it.

37:13.356 --> 37:18.402
Wayne Newton just happens to be
one of America's greatest entertainers.

37:18.612 --> 37:20.613
You don't know the affect
he has on women.

37:20.822 --> 37:23.616
Yes. Griswold.
Right this way, sir.

37:25.994 --> 37:27.828
Here.

37:28.038 --> 37:30.331
Make the seats good.

37:32.584 --> 37:34.168
No...

37:34.377 --> 37:36.879
No gratuity is necessary, sir.

37:37.088 --> 37:39.965
- No, really. Keep it.
- Follow me, please.

37:40.175 --> 37:41.926
Oh, Clark.

37:42.969 --> 37:45.554
- We're in the front row!
- I tipped him.

37:54.773 --> 37:56.440
What energy!

38:01.529 --> 38:02.863
Thank you.

38:03.073 --> 38:05.950
You're really
a magical group of people.

38:06.159 --> 38:09.703
Oh, Greg, give me some birds.
Let me hear some birds.

38:57.377 --> 38:59.128
Mrs. Ellen Griswold.

38:59.838 --> 39:01.672
Ellen, huh?

39:02.215 --> 39:05.968
Holy crap.
Wayne Newton's hitting on Mom.

39:06.177 --> 39:08.804
It's all part of the act, Russ.

39:09.014 --> 39:10.639
Now you.

39:26.531 --> 39:28.741
Well, I think we know
who sent the dress.

39:31.828 --> 39:35.622
You're very lucky. I've been to every
Wayne show for the last 15 years.

39:35.832 --> 39:39.084
And I've never seen him
do anything like this.

39:46.801 --> 39:50.304
No, I'm just saying I've never
heard you hit those notes before.

39:50.513 --> 39:55.142
Don't worry, Clark. You have nothing
to fear from Wayne Newton. He's...

39:55.351 --> 39:56.685
...unattainable.

39:56.895 --> 39:59.938
- Mom, you didn't see the way he was...?
- Watch your mouth.

40:00.148 --> 40:02.691
I think I'll go upstairs
and take a bath.

40:02.901 --> 40:04.735
Not me.

40:05.111 --> 40:08.072
- Anybody up for craps?
- We're too young, remember?

40:10.158 --> 40:12.534
Oh, yeah.
I remember when I was too young.

40:13.078 --> 40:15.079
Here.

40:15.288 --> 40:19.625
Both of you take 20 bucks.
If you need Daddy, I'll be...

40:19.834 --> 40:22.711
...rolling the dice. Have fun, kids.

40:23.379 --> 40:26.006
- Have a nice night.
- See you later.

40:28.885 --> 40:31.261
Daddy wants a seven! Let's go, seven!

40:31.471 --> 40:34.056
- Seven. A winner!
- Yeah!

40:34.265 --> 40:36.934
Place your bets.
Lucky roller coming out.

40:37.143 --> 40:39.770
- Place your bets.
- Yeah.

40:39.979 --> 40:41.480
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

40:41.731 --> 40:44.775
Let go of me. Let go of me!

40:44.984 --> 40:47.027
Clark? There he is. Clark!

40:47.237 --> 40:49.363
See, I told you. Clark!

40:49.572 --> 40:51.615
Look out, don't hurt me now.
Don't hurt me.

40:52.117 --> 40:54.284
Nice place for a pearl necklace.

40:54.494 --> 40:57.746
- Sir, do you know this person?
- No, no. Hi. Clark W. Griswold.

40:57.956 --> 40:59.915
Nice to meet you.

41:00.125 --> 41:04.086
Have you ever swam with the dolphins?
Them things is hard to catch.

41:04.295 --> 41:06.672
Twelve. Craps. A loser.

41:06.881 --> 41:10.843
Eddie, has anybody ever
told you before:

41:11.052 --> 41:12.803
"You're bad luck"?

41:13.138 --> 41:15.514
Those were my mother's dying words.

41:15.723 --> 41:18.892
But when you got your body covered
in third-degree burns...

41:19.102 --> 41:22.271
...and your foot's caught in a bear trap,
you'll talk crazy.

41:29.487 --> 41:32.364
I seem to have run out of pocket money.
Do you cash checks?

41:32.574 --> 41:36.285
- Only if you're staying at the hotel, sir.
- Indeed I am.

41:37.245 --> 41:39.371
There we are.

41:45.003 --> 41:47.212
No problem.

41:54.387 --> 41:55.721
Good luck, Mr. Griswold.

41:55.930 --> 41:57.806
Clark...

41:58.016 --> 42:01.310
...if you're thinking about buying me
a Cadillac, forget it.

42:01.519 --> 42:04.229
- I won't take it.
- No. Just trying to get even, Eddie.

42:04.689 --> 42:07.566
Now, where can I do
the most damage?

42:13.990 --> 42:15.699
Shrimp cocktail, 29 cents.

42:19.621 --> 42:22.623
- Fake IDs.
- How'd you know?

42:22.832 --> 42:25.542
When I was your age,
they had to use a water cannon...

42:25.752 --> 42:28.170
...to keep me away from the girls.

42:28.379 --> 42:30.380
Ten bucks. Ten, ten.

42:30.590 --> 42:31.882
Shrimp, ladies.

42:32.091 --> 42:33.508
Ten of them. I need the 10.

42:34.761 --> 42:36.094
Here.

42:36.304 --> 42:39.014
- Thanks.
- Have a good evening, Mr. Morris.

42:40.475 --> 42:41.642
Oh, whatever.

42:41.851 --> 42:44.728
- Another 21!
- Yeah, Clark, you nailed her there.

42:44.938 --> 42:48.190
Oh, okay. Let's see.
House has 14, and house busts.

42:48.399 --> 42:49.942
- You're on a roll now!
- Yeah!

42:50.151 --> 42:51.902
Wendy, you are my lucky charm.

42:52.111 --> 42:54.655
I don't know what is wrong
with me tonight.

42:56.115 --> 42:59.785
- You're rolling.
- Good luck, everybody.

43:02.121 --> 43:03.455
Good luck, everybody.

43:04.499 --> 43:06.166
Batter up.

43:08.711 --> 43:11.797
Big bet for a big man.

43:12.006 --> 43:14.633
Sure you don't wanna save
a few bucks for the buffet?

43:14.842 --> 43:17.552
Okay, wise guy. Let's see how you do
against three hands.

43:20.181 --> 43:22.224
This should be sweet.

43:22.433 --> 43:24.768
Sweet for me, Marty. You're finished.

43:29.607 --> 43:31.316
Straw.

43:32.235 --> 43:34.444
Eddie, I'm trying to concentrate.

43:35.238 --> 43:39.825
Oh, yeah! That's a bigger fire
than the red drink.

43:47.125 --> 43:49.584
Did you come to Las Vegas
to be a showgirl?

43:50.044 --> 43:52.546
No, I'm on vacation with my parents.

43:55.300 --> 43:57.968
Hard to believe we're related, right?

44:08.521 --> 44:10.605
- A drink, please.
- Welcome to the Riviera.

44:10.815 --> 44:12.566
May I see some ID?

44:21.200 --> 44:22.784
I think we have a problem, sir.

44:28.333 --> 44:30.125
Good night.

44:35.131 --> 44:36.631
Hey, pal, why the long face?

44:36.841 --> 44:39.718
You know that crap ID you sold me?
I want my 10 bucks back.

44:39.927 --> 44:42.220
Those lousy bums threw you out?

44:42.430 --> 44:45.223
Helicopter rides to the Grand Canyon.
See it as God does.

44:45.433 --> 44:46.933
They tossed me.

44:47.143 --> 44:48.310
Oops. Yeah.

44:48.936 --> 44:50.896
Don't they realize
what it's like to be:

44:51.105 --> 44:53.815
A boy on the town
When he's in love

44:54.025 --> 44:57.736
- Just give me my $10 back.
- I'm not through with you yet, all right?

44:57.945 --> 44:59.404
You're Nick Pappagiorgio.

44:59.614 --> 45:02.532
You're from Yuma, Arizona.
You're into software.

45:02.742 --> 45:05.285
Stick your head in and say,
"Joey Heatherton."

45:05.495 --> 45:09.122
- Right here on the strip?
- Smile, kid. You're in Vegas.

45:27.934 --> 45:31.353
So you guys have been together
longer than the real Beatles?

45:31.562 --> 45:32.854
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

45:33.064 --> 45:36.149
Great. Will you excuse me?

45:42.949 --> 45:44.908
Hey! You wanna dance up here?

45:45.118 --> 45:46.785
No, I don't think so.

45:47.453 --> 45:50.163
Audrey, honey, let me tell you
something I learned:

45:50.373 --> 45:54.084
In this world, you're either
up on the stage in the spotlight...

45:54.293 --> 45:56.420
...or down in the pit serving drinks.

45:56.629 --> 45:58.088
Go have some fun.

46:18.651 --> 46:20.360
Audrey?

46:22.697 --> 46:24.614
Audrey!

46:25.575 --> 46:27.242
What are you doing up there?

46:28.077 --> 46:31.288
I'm starting my vacation.

46:34.125 --> 46:36.710
She's gonna break a lot of hearts.

46:36.919 --> 46:38.628
She's gonna break something.

47:17.293 --> 47:21.046
Congratulations.
You've won the car.

47:21.255 --> 47:23.215
Could I see some ID, please?

47:29.472 --> 47:32.807
And where would you like the car sent,
Mr. Pappagiorgio?

47:39.106 --> 47:40.524
Eighteen.

47:41.442 --> 47:44.486
Nineteen. So close.

47:45.071 --> 47:46.738
Oh, come on.

47:46.948 --> 47:49.449
That's it. I've had enough.
Let's get out of here.

47:50.159 --> 47:52.661
Good luck, sir.

47:52.870 --> 47:56.498
I ain't seen a beating like that since
somebody stuck a banana in my pants...

47:56.707 --> 47:58.083
...and turned a monkey loose.

47:58.292 --> 48:00.126
Thanks for the pick-me-up, Eddie.

48:00.336 --> 48:03.463
Why don't you just call it a night
and let Ellen lick your wounds.

48:03.673 --> 48:07.008
That sounds great, but Ellen
went to sleep hours ago.

48:07.218 --> 48:10.345
Then she must be
one hell of a sleepwalker.

48:15.268 --> 48:17.269
Good night, Eddie.

48:17.562 --> 48:20.021
So that's how they got the title
"Danke Schoen."

48:20.231 --> 48:23.275
- It means "Thank you."
- "Thank you" in German.

48:23.859 --> 48:25.026
Oh.

48:26.571 --> 48:29.239
Ellen, what are you doing up?
I thought you went to bed.

48:29.448 --> 48:31.658
It got late.
I got worried about you.

48:31.867 --> 48:33.952
Clark, Wayne Newton.

48:34.161 --> 48:37.872
- Pleased to meet you.
- Into food preservatives? What a gas.

48:40.167 --> 48:41.501
I like it.

48:41.711 --> 48:44.504
- Being on the road is just...
- You've been everywhere.

48:44.714 --> 48:49.759
We never go anywhere. We're boring.
Clark falls asleep in front of the TV.

48:49.969 --> 48:53.013
I guess I'll just go upstairs
and get some sleep.

48:53.389 --> 48:56.433
Well, okay. Okay. Look.
Look, let me just tip the piano player.

48:56.642 --> 48:59.728
- She was marvelous.
- I might have some...

48:59.937 --> 49:01.688
I've got a chip here.

49:04.442 --> 49:05.650
Danke schoen.

49:06.527 --> 49:08.778
- Thanks.
- Like to sit down?

49:11.907 --> 49:13.491
Very special lady.

49:14.243 --> 49:17.912
That's why I entered into the sacred
bond of marriage with her.

49:18.497 --> 49:20.415
I hear that.

49:20.708 --> 49:24.044
You know, Clark, I love women.

49:24.253 --> 49:27.339
I observe them. I cherish them.

49:29.425 --> 49:32.052
Don't let that one
get out of your sight.

49:36.682 --> 49:38.308
Okay.

49:39.685 --> 49:44.689
Wayne has invited us to Shenandoah
tomorrow for lunch and festivities.

49:44.899 --> 49:47.150
- That's my home.
- Thank you.

49:47.360 --> 49:49.736
Love to. But we have a lot of plans,
don't we?

49:51.322 --> 49:53.114
Yeah.

49:53.324 --> 49:55.492
Oh, my God!

49:55.701 --> 49:58.078
It's Wayne Newton!

49:59.664 --> 50:04.292
I'm a fan, sir. I am a fan.
I can't believe I'm standing next to you.

50:04.502 --> 50:07.462
Well, here, take my seat, Eddie.

50:08.255 --> 50:12.384
- Thank you for the drink, Wayne.
- Okay. Good night, Wayne.

50:18.683 --> 50:22.519
Do you need a bodyguard?
I'd die for you.

50:29.318 --> 50:32.070
- Can I play five dollars in coins, please?
- What?

50:32.279 --> 50:34.447
I'd like to bet five dollars.

50:34.657 --> 50:36.783
Five dollars. New roller coming out.

50:36.992 --> 50:39.160
- Kid looks like a shooter.
- I'll go for this.

50:39.370 --> 50:41.996
- Go for this. I'm ready.
- He looks like a shooter.

50:42.206 --> 50:43.873
- Yo, 11, 7, any way!
- Come on!

50:44.083 --> 50:45.417
- Seven. Any way.
- Seven now.

50:45.626 --> 50:47.961
- Seven. A winner!
- Yeah.

50:48.170 --> 50:49.796
Way to go, kid.

50:51.340 --> 50:53.258
- You wanna press it?
- Press it?

50:53.467 --> 50:55.051
I wanna press this up.

50:55.261 --> 50:57.262
- Press this up?
- Yeah. Yeah, press it.

50:57.471 --> 50:59.639
Give him the dice. He can do it.
Come on.

50:59.849 --> 51:01.975
- Come on, baby. Come on.
- Seven. Any way.

51:02.184 --> 51:03.810
- Seven. Winner!
- Yeah!

51:04.019 --> 51:05.562
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

51:05.771 --> 51:07.814
Fantastic. This kid's great.

51:08.858 --> 51:11.568
I'm sorry to bother you, sir.
May I see some ID?

51:11.777 --> 51:13.778
Yeah. ID? Sure.

51:16.657 --> 51:18.366
Thank you.

51:21.996 --> 51:25.039
Welcome to the Mirage,
Mr. Pappagiorgio. My name is Dean.

51:25.249 --> 51:27.876
Why do they do that
when we got a hot table? Why?

51:28.085 --> 51:30.211
- Thank you, Dean.
- How do you like Yuma?

51:30.421 --> 51:31.921
Yuma. It's great.

51:32.131 --> 51:35.967
My wife and kids are back in Yuma
where I work in software...

51:36.177 --> 51:37.594
...in the software business.

51:37.803 --> 51:39.679
Hey, let the man roll the dice.

51:41.432 --> 51:43.224
No corrective lenses tonight?

51:44.852 --> 51:46.603
No, I do not require them.

51:48.063 --> 51:51.065
- Good luck, sir.
- Let's go, kid! Let's do this.

51:51.275 --> 51:52.692
- But you do.
- Come on!

51:52.902 --> 51:54.611
- Come on!
- Seven again.

51:54.820 --> 51:57.822
- Yes.
- Seven again! I can't believe it!

51:59.241 --> 52:03.703
- Russ? Audrey?
- Oh, Clark, don't wake them.

52:11.462 --> 52:13.755
Forget craps, forget blackjack...

52:13.964 --> 52:18.760
...if you wanna make money in a casino,
walk up to a baccarat table and say:

52:18.969 --> 52:21.262
"I wanna play baccarat."

52:21.472 --> 52:23.723
You feeling lucky tonight, Sparky?

52:23.933 --> 52:26.100
Not now, honey.
They're teaching me baccarat.

52:26.310 --> 52:27.936
I'm learning baccarat.

52:28.687 --> 52:30.480
Bet with the player.

52:32.358 --> 52:34.651
That's not exactly what I had in mind.

52:34.860 --> 52:38.863
Bet with the bank. Bet with the bank.
Bet with the player.

52:39.073 --> 52:40.740
Nine is a natural.

52:40.950 --> 52:43.076
Bet with the bank.
Bet with the player.

52:43.285 --> 52:46.538
Nine is a natural.

52:47.414 --> 52:48.998
Bet with the bank.

52:49.208 --> 52:50.792
Bet with the player.

52:51.001 --> 52:53.002
Nine is a natural.

52:53.212 --> 52:54.921
- Bet with the bank.
- Clark!

52:55.130 --> 52:56.881
Eight is a winner. What?

52:57.091 --> 52:58.591
- Honey...
- Give me that.

52:58.801 --> 53:01.427
Think we ought to be doing this
before we get married?

53:04.098 --> 53:06.766
- Hard six coming out.
- What?

53:06.976 --> 53:08.017
Hit me.

53:09.520 --> 53:10.979
Ow! Good night, honey.

53:14.358 --> 53:16.651
He'll do it again.
The kid's gonna do it again.

53:16.861 --> 53:18.236
- Do it again.
- Hit me!

53:18.445 --> 53:20.196
Right now. Ready?

53:21.490 --> 53:23.908
Seven out.

53:26.704 --> 53:29.205
- Nice roll, Mr. Nick.
- You did good, kid.

53:30.708 --> 53:32.917
- Thank you.
- Cash me in.

53:35.880 --> 53:39.340
- Kid, you made me a lot of money.
- Great roll.

53:39.550 --> 53:42.302
- Jilly from Philly.
- Nick Pappagiorgio from Yuma.

53:42.511 --> 53:45.388
Nick Pappagiorgio from Yuma?
You like getting massaged?

53:46.015 --> 53:47.807
- By who?
- By who? By me.

53:48.017 --> 53:50.143
Meet us in the spa
at 10:00 tomorrow morning.

53:50.352 --> 53:53.646
Randy, this guy is with us.
You take care of him.

53:53.856 --> 53:55.648
We're so impressed
with your playing...

53:55.858 --> 53:59.444
...we'd like to invite you to stay
in one of our suites. Follow me.

54:02.156 --> 54:06.534
And if there's anything you need,
don't hesitate to call me.

54:06.744 --> 54:08.578
Thank you.

54:40.027 --> 54:41.653
Oh, my God.

54:47.868 --> 54:50.453
Card counting, Clark?

54:50.663 --> 54:53.706
- Is that legal?
- Sharpens the player's edge.

54:54.500 --> 54:55.959
Hello.

54:56.168 --> 54:57.502
Hey! Here come the kids.

54:58.295 --> 55:00.380
Okay. What happened
to you last night?

55:02.341 --> 55:04.717
Hey, what are you having
for breakfast, lazybones?

55:04.927 --> 55:06.678
- Coffee.
- Make it three.

55:06.887 --> 55:08.471
Four it is. Hey, gang!

55:08.681 --> 55:10.348
Don't shout, Daddy.

55:10.557 --> 55:12.141
I had an idea.

55:12.351 --> 55:15.645
How about an "alone day"
where each of us Griswolds...

55:15.854 --> 55:19.732
...goes out and explores the city
of Las Vegas in their own personal way?

55:20.442 --> 55:22.568
I don't think that's a very good idea.

55:22.778 --> 55:23.987
- Great.
- Love you.

55:24.196 --> 55:26.280
Be back at 5.

55:27.533 --> 55:28.992
Oh, you'll have a great time.

55:29.201 --> 55:30.785
Have fun.

56:03.444 --> 56:05.278
Payback time.

56:10.576 --> 56:13.202
Five hundred dollars.

56:13.412 --> 56:15.121
You don't know when to quit,
do you?

56:15.706 --> 56:19.167
- Chips.
- Changing 500.

56:23.005 --> 56:24.297
Here's an idea:

56:24.506 --> 56:27.258
Why don't you give me half the money
you were gonna bet...

56:27.468 --> 56:31.846
...then we'll go out back, I'll kick you
in the nuts, and we'll call it a day?

56:39.438 --> 56:40.813
Pappagiorgio?

56:41.023 --> 56:44.984
- How are you enjoying that massage?
- I'm enjoying it, Jilly, I really am.

56:45.194 --> 56:48.362
You know what your problem is, Nick?
You're a nervous guy.

56:49.281 --> 56:51.074
You gotta learn how to relax.

56:51.283 --> 56:53.826
You're right, Jilly. I know I do.

56:54.036 --> 56:55.745
A little harder on the shoulders.

56:55.954 --> 56:57.538
That's it, kid.

56:57.748 --> 57:00.625
Now that you got that, all we gotta do
is teach you how to dress.

57:06.965 --> 57:09.092
Now aren't you a little slice of pie?

57:09.301 --> 57:11.636
Are you thinking of dancing, honey?

57:11.845 --> 57:14.222
- No.
- She's got a body for it, though.

57:14.431 --> 57:16.015
I do? Thanks.

57:16.225 --> 57:18.768
Well, do it while
you're young and foolish.

57:18.977 --> 57:22.688
I'm going to college in the fall, but
I'm doing volunteer work this summer.

57:22.898 --> 57:26.901
- Our prime years are few and fast.
- Woulda, coulda, shoulda.

57:27.111 --> 57:31.155
Helen, show this girl
something with a heel.

57:34.368 --> 57:35.910
Hit me.

57:36.954 --> 57:38.704
Yeah. Twenty.

57:40.791 --> 57:43.417
It's 20. It's a push!

57:43.836 --> 57:45.920
- I didn't lose.
- That's it.

57:46.130 --> 57:49.340
Griswold, you are freaking dead.

57:50.008 --> 57:52.301
I love you, kid!

57:52.511 --> 57:55.638
Fantastic. Unbelievable.

58:23.500 --> 58:27.295
Ellen. Outrageous.
Where's the rest of the family?

58:27.880 --> 58:29.881
They're busy.

58:30.757 --> 58:33.009
Did I catch you at a bad time?

58:33.218 --> 58:35.052
- Because I could just...
- No, no.

58:35.262 --> 58:39.557
A singer's body is his instrument,
and I believe in keeping it finely tuned.

58:40.434 --> 58:42.810
Come on in. Let's have some fun.

58:48.025 --> 58:49.400
Blackjack.

58:49.610 --> 58:50.943
Blackjack. Blackjack.

58:51.153 --> 58:53.446
- Yeah.
- Six!

59:10.172 --> 59:11.964
They're not bad.

59:12.925 --> 59:14.759
These boys aren't much to talk to...

59:14.968 --> 59:19.639
...but if you need a night away
from your cat, they're more than fine.

59:40.202 --> 59:41.953
No!

59:43.038 --> 59:44.705
Yeah!

59:58.136 --> 59:59.720
What? What did you say?

59:59.930 --> 01:00:02.807
I said, blackjack!

01:00:09.606 --> 01:00:11.357
Changing 1600.

01:00:14.528 --> 01:00:15.987
Lunch was wonderful.

01:00:16.196 --> 01:00:18.906
I hope you enjoyed the company
as much as the food.

01:00:19.241 --> 01:00:20.574
Oh, Wayne.

01:00:20.784 --> 01:00:22.994
Please, madame. Chin up.

01:00:24.079 --> 01:00:27.248
Ellen, you know,
I've always felt very blessed...

01:00:27.457 --> 01:00:30.251
...by all the gifts that I've been given.

01:00:30.877 --> 01:00:33.921
But after meeting you,
I realize how truly alone I am.

01:00:34.923 --> 01:00:38.009
But, Wayne, you have millions of fans.

01:00:38.218 --> 01:00:41.387
Please, they just love me
for my talent.

01:00:41.847 --> 01:00:44.849
I feel so many things right now.

01:00:45.058 --> 01:00:47.685
I wish I could spend
the rest of my life with you.

01:00:48.895 --> 01:00:50.563
Well...

01:00:50.772 --> 01:00:54.525
We could turn the den into a guest room.
But I don't know about your horses.

01:00:54.735 --> 01:00:58.904
Clark pretty much likes the garage
for the car and the lawnmowers.

01:01:03.994 --> 01:01:07.955
Ellen, you're too much.

01:01:08.165 --> 01:01:10.499
I have something for you.

01:01:20.302 --> 01:01:21.886
It's a lock of my hair.

01:01:25.057 --> 01:01:26.515
Gosh.

01:01:26.975 --> 01:01:29.643
Oh, it's getting late.

01:01:30.645 --> 01:01:34.273
I've gotta go. But thank you.

01:01:34.483 --> 01:01:36.525
- It's been wonderful.
- Ellen, wait.

01:01:38.153 --> 01:01:40.780
If you have nothing to do later,
please come back.

01:01:40.989 --> 01:01:43.032
I'm gonna make pasta.

01:01:47.788 --> 01:01:50.081
Come on, Griswold,
you think this sign's here...

01:01:51.541 --> 01:01:52.917
...to hold down the table?

01:01:54.169 --> 01:01:57.880
- What can I do with five dollars?
- Gee, I don't know.

01:01:58.090 --> 01:02:00.674
Buy a bullet and rent a gun?

01:02:07.057 --> 01:02:10.267
- Hey, I'll see you. Have a good time.
- Alrighty.

01:02:10.477 --> 01:02:12.311
Rusty?

01:02:13.522 --> 01:02:14.980
Ellen?

01:02:18.777 --> 01:02:20.653
Good luck, sir.

01:02:21.571 --> 01:02:23.364
I had a fantastic alone day, Clark.

01:02:23.573 --> 01:02:25.866
- It was a great idea.
- Oh, yeah.

01:02:26.076 --> 01:02:29.620
- Where did you get that stuff?
- At the men's store. Ask for Caesar.

01:02:29.996 --> 01:02:32.123
- Daddy!
- Oh, my God!

01:02:32.332 --> 01:02:35.251
- Look, Dad, Vickie took me to her stylist.
- Clark.

01:02:35.460 --> 01:02:39.422
Did you know there were 92 individual
muscles in the human throat?

01:02:39.631 --> 01:02:42.466
All this time I thought I was unhappy
with you and Mom.

01:02:42.676 --> 01:02:47.138
But I was just dissatisfied with myself.
All that's changed, thanks to Las Vegas.

01:02:47.347 --> 01:02:51.392
Dad, this is Larry, Kurt and Ira.
They're professional entertainers.

01:02:51.601 --> 01:02:53.602
- Nice to meet you, sir.
- How do you do?

01:02:53.812 --> 01:02:56.021
You know what drives me crazy?
Baccarat tables.

01:02:56.231 --> 01:02:59.442
Larry can bend his leg up over his head
without falling. Wanna see?

01:02:59.651 --> 01:03:01.444
- See this.
- It's after-riding wear.

01:03:01.653 --> 01:03:04.071
- If those guys weren't bust-outs...
- Isn't it lovely?

01:03:04.281 --> 01:03:06.449
All of you come with me now.

01:03:06.658 --> 01:03:08.451
Not you.

01:03:13.999 --> 01:03:17.084
Now, listen, I know we haven't seen
a lot of each other lately...

01:03:17.294 --> 01:03:19.920
...and that's okay,
but we're the Griswolds.

01:03:20.130 --> 01:03:21.755
And we're on vacation.

01:03:21.965 --> 01:03:25.050
And starting right now,
we're gonna have a great time.

01:03:25.260 --> 01:03:27.219
But, Dad, we're having a great time.

01:03:27.429 --> 01:03:30.055
Who knew my sister had
the legs of a thoroughbred?

01:03:30.265 --> 01:03:32.349
- Am I right?
- Shut up, Russ.

01:03:32.559 --> 01:03:35.060
The point is, starting now...

01:03:35.270 --> 01:03:37.480
...we're gonna have
a great time together.

01:03:37.689 --> 01:03:39.565
How?

01:03:39.774 --> 01:03:42.234
How? Well...

01:03:42.444 --> 01:03:44.028
How?

01:03:46.990 --> 01:03:48.407
Well, we could all...

01:03:48.617 --> 01:03:53.454
...sit on a bench as a family
and watch a beautiful Vegas sunset.

01:03:53.663 --> 01:03:54.997
Wouldn't that be great?

01:03:58.668 --> 01:04:00.252
Audrey.

01:04:00.462 --> 01:04:03.756
We could count the bulbs
on the strip. Audrey.

01:04:04.299 --> 01:04:07.176
Larry's taking me to see the world's
largest thermometer.

01:04:09.930 --> 01:04:11.972
I got a teeny thing
happening downtown.

01:04:13.558 --> 01:04:16.101
I mean, you know...

01:04:19.648 --> 01:04:22.107
Ellen? I know what we can do.

01:04:23.318 --> 01:04:25.861
We can get remarried. Right now.

01:04:26.071 --> 01:04:28.822
There's a Honeymoon Slots tournament
at the Golden Nugget.

01:04:29.032 --> 01:04:32.952
And guess what.
Newlyweds get in for free.

01:04:33.578 --> 01:04:35.788
I've got news for you, Clark:

01:04:35.997 --> 01:04:37.748
I haven't said yes yet.

01:04:42.128 --> 01:04:45.256
- Well, if you're all too busy...
- You hang on a minute, mister.

01:04:45.465 --> 01:04:47.591
You brought us for a family vacation...

01:04:47.801 --> 01:04:51.762
...and the only time we've spent
together is on your way to the casino.

01:04:51.972 --> 01:04:55.349
- I've invited you.
- You find the Clark Griswold I married...

01:04:55.559 --> 01:04:58.310
...and tell him I'm at the Mirage.

01:04:58.520 --> 01:04:59.895
Come on, kids.

01:05:01.773 --> 01:05:06.485
Don't worry about me. I got plenty
I can do on my own in Las Vegas.

01:05:15.036 --> 01:05:16.704
Which hand is it in?

01:05:18.873 --> 01:05:21.333
Who wants it now?
Who wants it?

01:05:21.543 --> 01:05:23.460
There you go, you little heathens.

01:05:24.212 --> 01:05:26.171
Eddie, thanks for buying me dinner.

01:05:26.381 --> 01:05:29.174
Best buck-49 buffet in town, Clark.

01:05:29.884 --> 01:05:32.261
Clark, this is all-you-can-eat.

01:05:32.470 --> 01:05:34.888
We only need one plate.

01:05:35.098 --> 01:05:37.266
Oh, yeah. Okay.

01:05:44.024 --> 01:05:45.399
These rolls.

01:05:45.609 --> 01:05:47.484
Oh, I had that last time I was here.

01:05:47.694 --> 01:05:49.028
Fresh broccoli.

01:05:50.780 --> 01:05:52.489
- God bless you.
- Thank you.

01:05:52.699 --> 01:05:56.201
Maybe I'll just replace
these and take a carrot.

01:05:56.411 --> 01:05:57.911
And that's the macaroni.

01:05:58.121 --> 01:06:01.874
- That's good.
- No, let's get a little more.

01:06:02.584 --> 01:06:04.918
Some of this spaghetti Bolognese here.

01:06:06.046 --> 01:06:12.593
You're lucky you came on Italian night.
That stuff will knock your socks off.

01:06:12.802 --> 01:06:14.887
This doesn't look like chicken.

01:06:15.096 --> 01:06:16.764
Oh, you're right.

01:06:16.973 --> 01:06:19.725
This isn't chicken. This is chicken.

01:06:19.934 --> 01:06:21.810
Want some?

01:06:22.020 --> 01:06:25.230
- I think I'll just be over by the Saltines.
- Oh, okay.

01:06:25.440 --> 01:06:27.983
- Here, go ahead.
- Go ahead and get us a table.

01:06:29.653 --> 01:06:33.489
I'll have some of the...
Some of the yellow.

01:06:34.282 --> 01:06:36.116
And don't get cheap on me.

01:06:42.707 --> 01:06:44.041
Mmm.

01:06:44.834 --> 01:06:47.670
This bread pudding is
extra-runny tonight.

01:06:47.879 --> 01:06:51.173
Eddie, when you look at me,
what do you see?

01:06:58.682 --> 01:07:00.891
Time's up, Eddie.

01:07:01.393 --> 01:07:02.810
I'll tell you what you see:

01:07:03.019 --> 01:07:05.562
You see a man
whose family counted on him...

01:07:05.772 --> 01:07:11.443
...to give them the best vacation ever.
And I can't do it. I can't do it, because...

01:07:13.571 --> 01:07:16.156
Eddie, you have something on your...

01:07:18.201 --> 01:07:20.577
- I get it?
- Yeah.

01:07:21.287 --> 01:07:24.707
Eddie, I've gambled away more money
than you'll ever understand.

01:07:25.625 --> 01:07:27.751
Try me.

01:07:32.090 --> 01:07:34.258
Twenty-two thousand,
six hundred dollars.

01:07:34.467 --> 01:07:37.136
Oh, God! Oh, God!

01:07:37.345 --> 01:07:38.721
- Oh, my God!
- Eddie.

01:07:38.930 --> 01:07:41.598
Oh, God!

01:07:41.808 --> 01:07:44.059
- Eddie! Please!
- Oh, my God.

01:07:48.106 --> 01:07:52.359
- Clark.
- I don't know what I'll tell Ellen. I mean...

01:07:53.528 --> 01:07:57.239
If I could just get that money back,
I could turn it all around.

01:07:58.074 --> 01:08:03.537
Clark, you've been so good
to Catherine and me through the years.

01:08:03.747 --> 01:08:05.330
I hate to see you down like this.

01:08:06.166 --> 01:08:08.250
I've got some...

01:08:20.388 --> 01:08:21.764
Money stashed away.

01:08:21.973 --> 01:08:27.935
And it'd be my honor to help you
in your time of need.

01:08:28.645 --> 01:08:30.564
You mean it?

01:08:30.939 --> 01:08:32.733
There's just one little problem.

01:08:34.027 --> 01:08:36.612
I forgot where I buried it.

01:08:38.698 --> 01:08:40.407
Is it safe to be digging like this?

01:08:40.617 --> 01:08:44.203
Oh, yeah.
Watch out for the scorpions.

01:08:52.754 --> 01:08:55.255
Yeah, I got money buried
all over this yard, Clark.

01:08:57.341 --> 01:09:00.051
I used to have quite
a little system for finding it.

01:09:00.261 --> 01:09:01.970
But... Oh, wait, here's something.

01:09:04.974 --> 01:09:06.809
Twenty-eight dollars.

01:09:08.812 --> 01:09:11.145
Got one. Got one. Got one.

01:09:16.069 --> 01:09:18.779
- Six bucks.
- Oh, yeah. Yuban coffee.

01:09:18.988 --> 01:09:23.367
You know you can sprinkle that stuff on
anything. Ice cream, mashed potatoes...

01:09:23.576 --> 01:09:26.578
...or just eat it right out of the can
for a quick pick-me-up.

01:09:28.247 --> 01:09:29.706
Oh, my God.

01:09:30.250 --> 01:09:32.835
There must be over $100 in here.

01:09:33.377 --> 01:09:36.462
Oh, yeah, yeah. That's from
when I sold one of my kidneys.

01:09:36.673 --> 01:09:39.091
We didn't really need
the cash at the time...

01:09:39.300 --> 01:09:41.926
...but I figured with all
the advances in medicine...

01:09:42.136 --> 01:09:45.680
...I might as well sell it while
somebody still wanted to buy it.

01:09:45.890 --> 01:09:48.225
Smartest thing I ever did, Clark.

01:09:48.810 --> 01:09:52.145
Eddie, why do you have all this
money buried in the ground?

01:09:52.564 --> 01:09:55.065
For a rainy day, Clark.

01:09:55.275 --> 01:09:57.693
And we don't get too many
of those in the desert.

01:10:02.782 --> 01:10:04.783
Where's the nearest casino?

01:10:05.285 --> 01:10:07.202
Hello, room service?

01:10:07.412 --> 01:10:11.748
I'd like the crab Rangoon,
chicken fingers...

01:10:11.958 --> 01:10:14.793
...the Jackpot Burger...

01:10:15.003 --> 01:10:17.921
...and the Tropical Banana Torte.

01:10:20.091 --> 01:10:23.135
No, cancel that.

01:10:23.344 --> 01:10:25.220
I'm going out.

01:10:25.555 --> 01:10:28.390
I gotta warn you, Clark.
They don't play the same games here...

01:10:28.600 --> 01:10:31.518
...that they do at them regular casinos.

01:10:34.397 --> 01:10:36.857
Eddie, this place is great.

01:10:37.066 --> 01:10:38.901
They don't have these games
at the Mirage.

01:10:40.361 --> 01:10:41.987
Pick a number? I'm great at that.

01:10:42.655 --> 01:10:45.449
Coin toss. Eddie, these are my games.

01:10:45.658 --> 01:10:48.243
Give me 20 bucks. War!

01:10:48.536 --> 01:10:51.330
You know,
Russ and I play this all the time.

01:10:51.789 --> 01:10:54.041
- I'm in.
- Here we go.

01:10:54.459 --> 01:10:55.751
Nine.

01:10:56.252 --> 01:10:57.628
That's fast.

01:10:57.837 --> 01:10:59.171
Give me another 20, Eddie.

01:11:02.342 --> 01:11:04.051
War. Bet again.

01:11:07.889 --> 01:11:09.681
- Nine again.
- You know, Clark...

01:11:09.891 --> 01:11:12.017
...maybe you ought to
spread it around...

01:11:12.226 --> 01:11:14.436
...not have all your fun
at just one table.

01:11:19.901 --> 01:11:22.527
Dealer has rock. Pay paper.

01:11:25.406 --> 01:11:27.908
- Call it.
- Clark, what say we go back home...

01:11:28.117 --> 01:11:30.827
...and bury what's left of my money?
- Heads.

01:11:32.205 --> 01:11:33.872
I'm sorry, sir, it's tails.

01:11:34.582 --> 01:11:36.291
Almost.

01:11:47.387 --> 01:11:49.221
Give me that! Give me that!

01:11:49.430 --> 01:11:50.847
- Clark.
- He cheated, Eddie.

01:11:51.057 --> 01:11:53.558
- Clark.
- He switched them. I saw him.

01:12:08.366 --> 01:12:10.075
- Four.
- Seven.

01:12:13.079 --> 01:12:14.955
Eddie, what am I doing?

01:12:16.082 --> 01:12:18.166
I need to go someplace
where a man can think.

01:12:18.376 --> 01:12:21.044
Oh, I wouldn't do that here, Clark.

01:12:21.254 --> 01:12:24.798
The stalls are awfully dirty
and they're backed up all the time.

01:12:25.591 --> 01:12:27.884
No. Eddie, I need to be alone.

01:12:28.886 --> 01:12:31.805
Oh, I see.

01:12:32.015 --> 01:12:33.849
You want me to go with you?

01:12:34.809 --> 01:12:36.935
All right. Come on.

01:12:39.063 --> 01:12:41.857
Come on, Clark. The night is young.

01:12:42.066 --> 01:12:44.943
They're giving away free
hot sandwiches at the blood bank.

01:12:45.153 --> 01:12:47.779
Hot sandwiches.
I'm not worthy of a hot sandwich.

01:12:47.989 --> 01:12:50.407
I'm not a father.
I'm not a husband. I'm nothing.

01:12:50.616 --> 01:12:53.910
Oh, you may feel like nothing now,
but look on the bright side.

01:12:54.120 --> 01:12:58.206
You used to be something, and nobody
can ever take that away from you.

01:12:59.417 --> 01:13:01.043
Goodbye, Ellen.

01:13:01.252 --> 01:13:04.463
I'm sure you'll be happy
with Wayne Newton.

01:13:05.256 --> 01:13:06.965
Where am I gonna go?

01:13:07.175 --> 01:13:09.634
Well, you can live with us
right here in Vegas.

01:13:09.844 --> 01:13:11.344
We'll dig you a guest room.

01:13:11.554 --> 01:13:13.722
Rusty and my poor little Audrey.

01:13:13.931 --> 01:13:16.224
And in the evening
you can sit outside...

01:13:16.434 --> 01:13:19.603
...and you can tell us all how much
more good you used to have it.

01:13:19.812 --> 01:13:23.106
Look at all these happy families.

01:13:23.357 --> 01:13:26.109
Where did I go wrong?
What did I do?

01:13:29.280 --> 01:13:31.865
Without my family,
there is no Clark Griswold.

01:13:32.075 --> 01:13:33.909
We could go into business
for ourselves.

01:13:34.118 --> 01:13:36.703
We can raise snakes,
maybe open up our own petting zoo.

01:13:36.913 --> 01:13:38.914
Yeah, that's what we could do.

01:13:39.123 --> 01:13:42.042
And we could have a lot of happy,
wonderful times, Clark.

01:13:42.502 --> 01:13:44.669
We'll get your money back.

01:13:44.879 --> 01:13:49.049
Eddie, I'm not worried
about my money.

01:13:49.258 --> 01:13:51.843
I don't care if I ever
get my money back.

01:13:52.261 --> 01:13:53.678
I gotta get my family back.

01:13:54.555 --> 01:13:57.974
- Well, what about my money?
- You stay here. I'll be right back.

01:14:00.228 --> 01:14:01.311
Police emergency.

01:14:01.521 --> 01:14:03.605
Hey! What are you doing there?

01:14:05.274 --> 01:14:08.527
- Uh-oh.
- Hey! Hey! Open up!

01:14:08.736 --> 01:14:11.196
- Open this door!
- Don't be alarmed. He's with me.

01:14:11.405 --> 01:14:13.740
Hey! Hey! Hey!

01:14:17.829 --> 01:14:19.704
Say cheese.

01:14:24.919 --> 01:14:26.795
Oh, Wayne.

01:14:30.049 --> 01:14:31.758
It's Dean Martin's recipe.

01:14:31.968 --> 01:14:34.177
I always make too much.

01:14:34.387 --> 01:14:36.638
Thank you so much
for having me for dinner.

01:14:37.140 --> 01:14:39.015
Ellen, I...

01:14:39.225 --> 01:14:41.476
There's something I have to tell you.

01:14:42.728 --> 01:14:44.354
Oh, no.

01:14:45.148 --> 01:14:46.523
Wayne, please don't.

01:14:46.732 --> 01:14:49.734
Ellen, I've always been a moral man.

01:14:50.528 --> 01:14:54.197
But my resolve is melting in the
blinding light of your precious smile.

01:14:54.615 --> 01:14:56.992
Maybe you're hungry.
Would you like some pasta?

01:14:57.201 --> 01:15:00.120
On your right is Treasure Island.
On the left is Harrah's.

01:15:00.329 --> 01:15:02.497
Next stop, Wayne Newton's house.

01:15:04.917 --> 01:15:06.710
Wayne, please.

01:15:07.461 --> 01:15:09.254
Please.

01:15:09.881 --> 01:15:11.673
Wayne!

01:15:17.722 --> 01:15:19.514
Ellen, don't worry. I'm here, honey.

01:15:19.724 --> 01:15:23.476
Get out of my way.
Hands off my wife!

01:15:27.064 --> 01:15:30.942
Clark, it's not the way it looks.
We were just having pasta.

01:15:31.152 --> 01:15:32.944
Ellen, I've been a fool.

01:15:33.154 --> 01:15:37.365
And not a loveable fool who clowns for
the delight of children and small people.

01:15:38.451 --> 01:15:41.786
But a fool who's only fooling himself.

01:15:42.788 --> 01:15:45.624
Clark, you're back.

01:15:45.833 --> 01:15:48.376
You have got to be kidding me.

01:15:48.586 --> 01:15:50.962
Oh, why don't you go sing something?

01:15:51.172 --> 01:15:55.258
Ellen, I've learned that
a family vacation only works...

01:15:55.468 --> 01:15:58.929
...when you're with your family.
And you and Russ and...

01:15:59.138 --> 01:16:01.348
- Audrey.
- Audrey.

01:16:01.557 --> 01:16:03.475
You are my family.

01:16:03.684 --> 01:16:08.688
And the most important thing is for us
to get back together before it's too late.

01:16:09.106 --> 01:16:11.816
- What do you say, Ellen?
- I'm with you, baby.

01:16:12.568 --> 01:16:13.693
Then let's go get our kids.

01:16:20.117 --> 01:16:21.743
- Is there a charge for parking?
- No.

01:16:21.953 --> 01:16:23.453
Park it.

01:16:26.749 --> 01:16:29.459
Hey, have you seen this person?

01:16:29.669 --> 01:16:31.795
Mr. Pappagiorgio. Yeah, Lanai 6.

01:16:32.004 --> 01:16:33.421
My son.

01:16:33.631 --> 01:16:36.007
Mr. Pappagiorgio?

01:16:36.217 --> 01:16:37.926
Let's go.

01:16:38.135 --> 01:16:41.304
Oh, boy. Oh, boy.

01:16:45.226 --> 01:16:46.559
- Rusty!
- Russ!

01:16:46.769 --> 01:16:49.854
- Oh, Clark, do something.
- Okay. Look out.

01:16:55.820 --> 01:16:57.237
Russ! Rusty!

01:16:59.824 --> 01:17:02.075
Oh, my little baby boy!

01:17:02.285 --> 01:17:06.079
- Rusty?
- Excuse me. Excuse me.

01:17:11.919 --> 01:17:13.586
Russ.

01:17:14.714 --> 01:17:18.216
Am I right? I mean, am I right?

01:17:19.969 --> 01:17:21.970
- Oh, Nick.
- So I says to him...

01:17:22.179 --> 01:17:24.347
...I said, "Get your own monkey."

01:17:24.974 --> 01:17:26.766
Oh, my Lord. Rusty!

01:17:27.601 --> 01:17:30.061
Oh, you must be lost.
This is Mr. Pappagiorgio.

01:17:30.271 --> 01:17:33.189
His name is not Pappagiorgio.
His name is Rusty Griswold...

01:17:33.399 --> 01:17:36.943
...and he's a C-plus student. Now,
out of the pool! Let's go, young man!

01:17:37.153 --> 01:17:38.820
- Dad!
- Now!

01:17:43.576 --> 01:17:46.453
I'm looking for an underage kid
named Pappagiorgio. Seen him?

01:17:46.662 --> 01:17:49.748
Yes, he stole my wallet.
He's back there.

01:17:51.292 --> 01:17:52.667
- Where's your sister?
- Audrey?

01:17:52.877 --> 01:17:54.419
She's with Vickie somewhere.

01:17:54.628 --> 01:17:56.463
- Where's Vickie?
- Where's Vickie?

01:18:09.101 --> 01:18:11.853
- Mr. Pappagiorgio, your usual table?
- Not tonight.

01:18:12.063 --> 01:18:14.564
You are in deep trouble, my friend.

01:18:15.149 --> 01:18:16.775
Excuse me.

01:18:26.369 --> 01:18:28.036
Hey, everybody!

01:18:28.245 --> 01:18:29.579
Vickie, where's Audrey?

01:18:33.042 --> 01:18:34.376
Oh, my God.

01:18:37.797 --> 01:18:39.798
- Our baby.
- Hang on, honey!

01:18:40.007 --> 01:18:41.883
Daddy's coming to get you!

01:18:43.010 --> 01:18:45.845
Excuse me.
Get out of my way, please.

01:18:46.055 --> 01:18:49.307
- What do you think you're doing?
- You told me to get a summer job!

01:18:49.517 --> 01:18:53.645
What? Ten years of tap-dancing
lessons and this is how you repay me?

01:18:53.854 --> 01:18:55.730
Let's go, young lady.

01:18:55.940 --> 01:18:58.441
Excuse me! Excuse me!

01:18:58.901 --> 01:19:00.944
Come on, let's get out of here.

01:19:09.370 --> 01:19:14.040
Oh, Daddy. I don't know what
I was thinking. Let's go home right now.

01:19:14.250 --> 01:19:17.544
- Yeah, when are we going?
- Let's just quit while we're ahead.

01:19:17.753 --> 01:19:20.797
Ahead or behind, what does it matter?

01:19:21.006 --> 01:19:24.717
- We still have each other.
- Sparky.

01:19:25.261 --> 01:19:28.304
And when we get home, even though
I've lost most of our money...

01:19:28.514 --> 01:19:32.892
Wait a minute.
"I've lost most of our money"?

01:19:33.102 --> 01:19:34.978
How much did you lose?

01:19:35.896 --> 01:19:38.481
Well, with the checks
and the credit cards...

01:19:38.691 --> 01:19:42.193
...a couple of trips to the ATM
and the plane tickets I cashed in...

01:19:42.403 --> 01:19:47.449
...I don't know, 22, 23,000 dollars.
Somewhere in there.

01:19:47.658 --> 01:19:50.076
- What?
- Dad, what about my tuition?

01:19:50.286 --> 01:19:53.246
- You were gonna buy me a snowboard.
- We still have our love.

01:19:54.790 --> 01:19:56.958
That's what I've come to realize.

01:19:57.168 --> 01:20:00.587
Clark, how much money
do you have right now?

01:20:03.048 --> 01:20:05.008
I'm broke.

01:20:05.342 --> 01:20:07.302
- Rusty?
- I spent it all.

01:20:07.511 --> 01:20:09.262
Having an entourage is expensive.

01:20:09.680 --> 01:20:12.974
- Audrey?
- No pockets.

01:20:15.519 --> 01:20:19.522
I've got two dollars.

01:20:21.817 --> 01:20:25.361
Clark, get our money back.

01:20:30.826 --> 01:20:32.702
There.

01:20:35.706 --> 01:20:37.999
I'm telling you,
this is not the way to do this.

01:20:38.209 --> 01:20:41.544
- Can't your parents wire us money?
- There.

01:20:43.214 --> 01:20:47.467
Oh, Keno. Oh, this is easy.
I saw this on TV.

01:20:54.099 --> 01:20:56.976
Okay, you gotta pick 10 numbers.

01:20:57.186 --> 01:20:59.854
We've gotta play the kids' birthdays,
16 and 7.

01:21:00.064 --> 01:21:02.607
Oh, and Dad's old football number, 44.

01:21:09.990 --> 01:21:13.701
- Excuse me, is that your family?
- Yeah.

01:21:14.161 --> 01:21:17.539
- You're a lucky man.
- Luckiest guy on earth.

01:21:18.040 --> 01:21:20.667
Don't forget Grandma
and Granddad's anniversary.

01:21:21.627 --> 01:21:23.878
I never got married. I was scared.

01:21:24.088 --> 01:21:26.756
Afraid to take the risk. Beautiful children.

01:21:27.841 --> 01:21:31.344
Oh, thank you. We're very blessed.

01:21:31.554 --> 01:21:33.429
This whole thing
is money, money, money.

01:21:33.931 --> 01:21:36.975
Let me tell you something.
Money isn't everything.

01:21:37.309 --> 01:21:39.978
I sit here alone, you know.
Nobody cares.

01:21:40.437 --> 01:21:43.356
If I win at something,
I have nobody to share it with.

01:21:43.899 --> 01:21:47.610
Well, you have your health.

01:21:47.820 --> 01:21:50.822
- It seems you have a hobby.
- Yeah, a hobby I got. That's it.

01:21:51.031 --> 01:21:52.991
My health...

01:21:53.200 --> 01:21:56.494
If I did have a family,
I'd like it to be like yours.

01:21:59.999 --> 01:22:02.875
Tonight, consider yourself
part of our family.

01:22:04.795 --> 01:22:07.046
Yeah. I'm gonna take you up on that.

01:22:07.256 --> 01:22:09.007
- Really. Thank you.
- Okay.

01:22:09.216 --> 01:22:10.842
Nice of you.
Good luck.

01:22:11.051 --> 01:22:13.469
- Hey, Dad, game's almost starting.
- Yeah.

01:22:17.725 --> 01:22:20.184
- Seven.
- It's seven.

01:22:20.394 --> 01:22:22.562
It's Audrey's birthday.

01:22:22.771 --> 01:22:24.397
We're gonna do it.

01:22:24.607 --> 01:22:26.232
Ten.

01:22:30.321 --> 01:22:33.114
- Fourteen.
- Doesn't matter.

01:22:33.490 --> 01:22:36.868
Even eight matches wins $15,500.

01:22:37.077 --> 01:22:39.162
Twenty-two.

01:22:40.914 --> 01:22:42.832
Thirty-three.

01:22:45.377 --> 01:22:46.878
Eighty.

01:23:01.185 --> 01:23:03.978
Your final number, 54.

01:23:12.738 --> 01:23:16.240
I won. I won. I won.

01:23:16.450 --> 01:23:18.159
I won!

01:23:19.787 --> 01:23:22.622
I won! I won!

01:23:23.165 --> 01:23:25.792
All the years I've waited for this.
Years!

01:23:26.001 --> 01:23:30.505
I've been coming here for...
I've never won once, and now I won.

01:23:30.714 --> 01:23:35.134
The money is mine. I have the money.
The money is mine. I got it!

01:23:35.344 --> 01:23:38.638
For the first time, I got the...

01:23:46.063 --> 01:23:48.314
Hey, sir, are you all right?

01:23:51.026 --> 01:23:52.568
Rusty.

01:23:53.529 --> 01:23:56.072
Get... Go get someone.

01:23:57.741 --> 01:23:59.325
Sir.

01:24:03.038 --> 01:24:04.831
Oh, my God.

01:24:05.040 --> 01:24:07.500
I won. I won the money.

01:24:07.710 --> 01:24:10.712
I won. I won the money.
Did you hear me? I said I won.

01:24:10.921 --> 01:24:13.715
- It's okay.
- It's here. Right here.

01:24:15.843 --> 01:24:18.177
- That's wonderful.
- I won the money.

01:24:18.470 --> 01:24:21.055
I won the money.

01:24:21.390 --> 01:24:23.307
That's wonderful.

01:25:00.637 --> 01:25:02.638
What did he say?

01:25:02.848 --> 01:25:05.141
I think he said, "Take the ticket."

01:25:06.518 --> 01:25:08.936
He said, "Take the ticket"?

01:25:09.271 --> 01:25:11.272
I think he did.

01:25:19.323 --> 01:25:22.241
He's gone.
There was nothing you could do.

01:25:22.910 --> 01:25:26.037
- We'll never even know his name.
- He was Mr. Ellis.

01:25:26.246 --> 01:25:29.165
- The loneliest guy I ever saw.
- He would've given anything...

01:25:29.374 --> 01:25:32.752
...just to have someone sit with him
and say a few nice words.

01:25:44.389 --> 01:25:46.224
Jeez.

01:26:20.384 --> 01:26:24.387
I hope you kids have learned
something about the dangers of gambling.

01:26:24.596 --> 01:26:27.098
No, no, Sparklet.
Don't blame gambling.

01:26:27.516 --> 01:26:29.851
Gambling is what made America great.

01:26:30.060 --> 01:26:35.690
You see, kids, when Columbus
set sail on a little rickety boat...

01:26:35.899 --> 01:26:39.068
...and let it ride to the New World
on a single tank of gas...

01:26:39.278 --> 01:26:42.446
...that was a gamble.
Ben Franklin, Thomas Edison...

01:26:43.156 --> 01:26:45.074
...Albert Einstein, all gamblers.

01:26:45.492 --> 01:26:48.828
- Wasn't Einstein German?
- Hard to tell from his accent, Russ.

01:26:49.246 --> 01:26:51.330
But I do know one thing.

01:26:51.540 --> 01:26:53.583
When a beautiful young
blond co-ed...

01:26:53.792 --> 01:26:57.670
...took a chance on a gangly boy
of a man named Clark...

01:26:57.880 --> 01:27:00.548
...she was taking a gamble too.

01:27:06.096 --> 01:27:09.640
Ellen Priscilla Ruth Smith Griswold...

01:27:13.812 --> 01:27:16.147
...will you remarry me?

01:27:29.077 --> 01:27:31.871
Ellen Griswold, do you promise
to love and honor Clark...

01:27:32.080 --> 01:27:33.873
...for as long as you both shall live?

01:27:35.792 --> 01:27:37.919
Oh, God!

01:27:41.048 --> 01:27:44.008
- I do.
- Clark Griswold, do you...?

01:27:44.217 --> 01:27:46.886
I love you, Eddie.

01:27:49.222 --> 01:27:51.015
Promise to love and honor Ellen...

01:27:51.224 --> 01:27:54.644
...for as long as you both shall live?
- I do.

01:27:55.103 --> 01:27:58.940
I don't care if you ruined my life.
I love you!

01:27:59.858 --> 01:28:02.610
Then by the power vested in me
by the state of Nevada...

01:28:02.819 --> 01:28:05.196
...and the Las Vegas
Entertainers' Association...

01:28:05.405 --> 01:28:07.156
...I now pronounce you man and wife.

01:28:07.366 --> 01:28:08.783
You may kiss the bride.

01:28:28.011 --> 01:28:29.387
Eddie...

01:28:30.138 --> 01:28:32.390
...this is for you.

01:28:32.599 --> 01:28:35.685
Clark, where did all this come from?

01:28:35.894 --> 01:28:38.938
Well, we were very, very
fortunate last night, Eddie...

01:28:39.147 --> 01:28:42.650
...and I think the Griswolds...
We learned something on this vacation.

01:28:42.859 --> 01:28:47.613
And that is that it's not what you have
but who you have to share it with.

01:28:47.823 --> 01:28:50.116
- Dad.
- In a minute, Russ.

01:28:50.325 --> 01:28:54.620
You see, the promise of material
possessions can often blind one to the...

01:28:54.830 --> 01:28:56.414
What is it, Russ?

01:28:56.623 --> 01:28:58.290
Those four cars over there...

01:29:00.252 --> 01:29:01.961
...they're mine.

01:29:03.547 --> 01:29:06.590
What do you mean, they're...?
They're yours?

01:29:06.800 --> 01:29:07.967
Yeah.

01:29:10.554 --> 01:29:13.055
- Where'd you get them?
- I pulled four slot machines...

01:29:13.265 --> 01:29:17.768
...and I won four cars, you know.
I put a dollar in, I got a car.

01:29:17.978 --> 01:29:20.479
Okay. I think I get it.

01:29:20.689 --> 01:29:23.607
- Give me the keys, please.
- Five thousand dollars?

01:29:24.067 --> 01:29:27.069
- Excuse me a minute.
- Five thousand dollars.

01:29:29.114 --> 01:29:31.991
Okay, Ellen, you drive the red one.

01:29:32.200 --> 01:29:33.868
You take the white one.

01:29:34.077 --> 01:29:37.288
You take the Mustang, and I'll take
that big black thing over there.

01:29:37.497 --> 01:29:39.373
After you, Mr. Pappagiorgio.

01:29:39.583 --> 01:29:41.292
- Goodbye, Eddie.
- Goodbye, Clark.

01:29:41.501 --> 01:29:42.960
- Bye, everybody.
- Bye, Ellen.

01:29:43.170 --> 01:29:45.546
- Bye, Eddie.
- Bye.

01:29:47.257 --> 01:29:48.966
- Bye, guys!
- Bye!

01:29:49.176 --> 01:29:50.843
Drive carefully!

01:29:51.053 --> 01:29:52.970
Have a good trip!
