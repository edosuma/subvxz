01:10.522 --> 01:11.647
Doctor's log.

01:11.738 --> 01:14.851
It's day 243 in this...

01:15.107 --> 01:17.065
Portobello purgatory.

01:17.897 --> 01:20.314
My only companion is a rock I named stone.

01:23.459 --> 01:27.167
The question is,
for whom am I narrating this?

01:29.297 --> 01:32.789
It seems I've become a featured player
in the theater of the absurd.

01:32.897 --> 01:36.189
Marooned in deep space
by that wretched blue rodent.

01:36.191 --> 01:40.608
But it's all good, thanks to a breathable
atmosphere and my supreme intellect,

01:40.610 --> 01:43.922
sharpened against the only competitor
savvy enough to bring it.

01:43.923 --> 01:45.605
Chanterelle to d4.

01:46.689 --> 01:50.179
I've been striving to make fungi
into a functional drink of choice...

01:50.180 --> 01:51.397
Mushroom coffee.

01:54.370 --> 01:55.976
With limited...

01:56.858 --> 01:58.265
Limited...

01:59.735 --> 02:01.193
Limited...

02:01.968 --> 02:03.212
Success.

02:06.895 --> 02:09.608
But today, day 243,

02:09.609 --> 02:12.897
has brought a new optimism
to my most pressing endeavor...

02:13.336 --> 02:17.875
Planetus exodus to returnicus
and kick blue butticus.

02:24.730 --> 02:26.480
If my calculations are correct,

02:26.482 --> 02:29.218
and there's no reason to say "if"
because they always are...

02:30.596 --> 02:34.388
This quill is going to power
my masterpiece.

02:36.689 --> 02:38.064
Let's light this candle...

02:39.545 --> 02:41.492
And see who comes a-knockin'.

03:48.400 --> 03:49.608
Greetings!

03:55.705 --> 03:57.400
Klaatu barada nikto.

04:07.893 --> 04:09.964
Agent stone?
Now!

04:20.290 --> 04:21.634
Thank you, stone.

04:23.105 --> 04:27.837
It's time to say goodbye
to this piece-of-shiitake planet!

04:52.837 --> 04:54.627
Where did you get that?

04:58.537 --> 05:01.486
From a little blue menace
on the planet called earth.

05:03.772 --> 05:05.980
I'd be happy to show you the way.

05:40.831 --> 05:42.082
They're still on us.

05:42.972 --> 05:44.139
This'll slow 'em down.

06:10.962 --> 06:13.734
Watch out. Excuse me.
Pardon me. Coming through.

06:14.802 --> 06:17.196
Good evening, gentlemen.
Mind if I drive?

06:18.943 --> 06:20.318
Better buckle up.

06:28.237 --> 06:29.875
How we doing back there?

06:30.897 --> 06:32.488
And now this way.

06:41.555 --> 06:44.493
I'm sorry.
I don't speak duct tape.

06:44.689 --> 06:47.147
- What the heck are you?
- Fear not, citizen.

06:47.149 --> 06:51.228
I am the hero you need
and the hero you deserve.

06:51.314 --> 06:53.772
The blue dawn that banishes the darkest...

06:53.831 --> 06:54.998
Holy crap!

06:59.253 --> 07:02.236
Don't worry.
Nobody's gonna get hurt.

07:07.142 --> 07:08.654
- What are those?
- Bombs. Bombs.

07:08.655 --> 07:10.279
They're bombs!
Those are bombs!

07:10.280 --> 07:12.490
Relax. They're not even lit.

07:12.491 --> 07:15.686
So I'll say again, nobody's gonna get...

07:17.064 --> 07:19.131
I was wrong!
We're all gonna die!

07:21.670 --> 07:23.193
Why aren't you slowing down?

07:23.194 --> 07:25.156
That would require brakes.

07:27.326 --> 07:29.779
It's hot. Hot, hot, hot!
Hot, hot, hot!

07:29.781 --> 07:31.231
Why don't you just let
the police handle this?

07:31.233 --> 07:34.765
Because that's not what heroes do.

07:37.190 --> 07:40.820
Thank you very much.
Please hold your applause.

07:44.488 --> 07:47.187
Do you hear that?
There's one bomb left.

07:49.726 --> 07:52.851
- Did you check under the seat?
- Of course I checked under the seat!

07:54.398 --> 07:56.065
You are terrible at this!

07:56.074 --> 07:56.754
You know what?

07:56.755 --> 07:59.395
Your negative attitude
is not helping anyone.

07:59.671 --> 08:01.445
It's in your spiky things!

08:02.947 --> 08:05.164
I can never find anything in here.

08:06.437 --> 08:08.731
Drained it from downtown!

08:09.823 --> 08:12.820
See? I told you
nobody would get hurt.

08:15.238 --> 08:17.164
Holy sherbet!

08:18.856 --> 08:20.335
Oh, hello.

08:20.336 --> 08:23.156
Don't panic.
This is only a drill.

09:05.639 --> 09:08.931
- Come here!
- No need to thank me, citizens.

09:09.023 --> 09:11.648
All in a night's work for...

09:11.941 --> 09:13.900
Blue justice!

09:14.890 --> 09:16.820
You're a terrible hero!

09:28.569 --> 09:31.140
- Morning, Wade!
- Morning, Sonic!

09:38.070 --> 09:41.468
Good morning, green hills!

09:59.962 --> 10:01.045
Come on.

10:24.143 --> 10:25.143
Sonic.

10:25.628 --> 10:27.534
I miss you, longclaw.

10:28.038 --> 10:29.885
I'm trying to make you proud.

10:38.918 --> 10:42.669
And now for a little shut-eye.

10:46.874 --> 10:48.582
Ozzy, morning breath!

10:48.607 --> 10:50.926
Sonic. Are you still in bed?

10:51.111 --> 10:53.419
You're supposed to meet Tom, remember?

10:55.153 --> 10:58.778
All right, all right, I'm up!
I'm up.

11:00.213 --> 11:01.504
What a day.

11:04.044 --> 11:05.739
Thanks for coming out, bud.

11:06.535 --> 11:09.572
I feel like you and me,
we haven't had much time together lately.

11:12.231 --> 11:14.273
How's it going over there?
You getting any bites?

11:22.190 --> 11:23.773
I can't swim!
Help!

11:23.782 --> 11:26.036
If I die, don't look in my closet!

11:26.038 --> 11:28.705
Hey, hey, you're good.
You're all right. Come on.

11:29.606 --> 11:32.333
- It's freezing.
- All right, okay. Take it easy.

11:33.940 --> 11:36.200
You're good. Okay.

11:39.648 --> 11:42.523
But now that you've had a nap and a bath...

11:42.606 --> 11:47.622
I went up to your room last night
to bring you some new comics and...

11:51.207 --> 11:52.746
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Stop right there.

11:52.747 --> 11:53.866
I wouldn't come any closer,

11:53.867 --> 11:57.065
because this little hedgehog
had way too many chili dogs.

11:57.067 --> 11:58.538
Oh, no. Oh, no.

11:59.090 --> 12:01.354
I'm so embarrassed.
Get out of here quick!

12:01.356 --> 12:03.270
Oh, no, here comes another one!

12:03.690 --> 12:05.773
Go. Now. Save yourself.

12:05.775 --> 12:07.212
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Stop right there.

12:07.213 --> 12:08.565
I wouldn't come any closer,

12:08.567 --> 12:11.717
because this little hedgehog
had way too many chili dogs.

12:11.718 --> 12:13.114
Oh, no. Oh, no.

12:13.736 --> 12:15.825
I'm so embarrassed.
Get out of here...

12:16.023 --> 12:17.997
I knew I should've used real farts.

12:20.898 --> 12:22.614
- How many times are we gonna do this?
- What?

12:22.621 --> 12:25.277
Cast your line and not catch anything?
Seems like a billion.

12:25.278 --> 12:26.981
I think you know what I'm talking about.

12:27.573 --> 12:30.073
The lying.
The sneaking out.

12:30.132 --> 12:31.660
The pretending to be Batman.

12:31.661 --> 12:34.661
- Blue justice, trademark pending.
- Whatever. You're being reckless.

12:35.231 --> 12:36.690
Not this conversation again.

12:36.763 --> 12:38.653
Hey. It's no fun for me, either.

12:38.660 --> 12:41.144
But if you keep being irresponsible,
we're gonna keep having this conversation.

12:41.145 --> 12:43.675
How is it irresponsible to use my powers?

12:43.676 --> 12:46.648
Sonic, you destroyed an entire city block!

12:46.650 --> 12:49.567
That block was already messed up.
Who cares?

12:49.569 --> 12:53.246
Look, I stopped a robbery.
I was a hero.

12:53.247 --> 12:56.559
No, you put people in danger
and that's not what a hero does.

12:59.648 --> 13:01.825
You're supposed to be my friend.

13:01.864 --> 13:03.551
Stop trying to be my dad.

13:08.419 --> 13:10.155
I can take care of myself.

13:10.231 --> 13:14.815
Sonic, taking care of yourself
is not what being a hero's all about.

13:14.968 --> 13:17.333
It's about taking responsibility
for other people.

13:18.315 --> 13:21.833
And right now, whether you want to hear
this or not, you are still just a kid.

13:22.315 --> 13:25.815
You got some more growing up to do
before you're ready to be the big hero.

13:26.854 --> 13:28.354
But trust me when I tell you,

13:28.356 --> 13:30.903
there will come a time
when your powers will be needed.

13:32.958 --> 13:35.122
But you don't choose that moment.

13:35.596 --> 13:37.419
That moment chooses you.

13:39.148 --> 13:40.398
Look at you.

13:40.481 --> 13:43.059
Look at that.
I just got goose bumps.

13:43.315 --> 13:45.065
Wait a second.
Did you steal that from Oprah?

13:45.067 --> 13:47.926
No, sir.
That is a wachowski family special.

13:48.273 --> 13:52.512
Came from my dad,
in this very boat, on this very lake.

13:53.523 --> 13:56.129
He would always try and steer me
in the right direction.

13:56.895 --> 13:59.335
And that's what maddie and
I have always tried to do with you.

14:00.148 --> 14:03.528
So, until your moment arrives,

14:04.335 --> 14:06.752
I want you to work on
being a little more responsible.

14:08.273 --> 14:09.356
Comprende?

14:10.190 --> 14:11.440
Comprende.

14:12.190 --> 14:13.523
High five on it.

14:14.260 --> 14:17.941
Yeah! Donut lord and the blue blur
are back at it again!

14:17.942 --> 14:18.981
Hang on.

14:19.715 --> 14:20.715
Speedboat!

14:24.858 --> 14:26.129
Sonic!

14:28.188 --> 14:31.938
How excited are you,
going to Hawaii with me?

14:31.940 --> 14:33.309
Oh, yeah!

14:36.457 --> 14:39.944
Welcome to Sonic air,
the fastest way to travel.

14:39.981 --> 14:42.004
Now boarding groups one and two.

14:43.898 --> 14:46.413
Sonic, this is so fun!

14:46.414 --> 14:49.238
I'm sorry, ma'am, you're group three.
Please wait your turn.

14:49.239 --> 14:52.519
- Anyone from groups one and two? Nobody?
- Just let him get it out of his system.

14:52.520 --> 14:55.028
Okay, then everybody else right this way.

14:55.273 --> 14:56.398
Thank you.

15:01.315 --> 15:02.440
And you, sir?

15:04.106 --> 15:05.606
Terrible shirt detected.

15:05.690 --> 15:06.690
There we go.

15:06.960 --> 15:10.778
Okay, you're free to go. Enjoy your trip.
Bye-bye now.

15:11.065 --> 15:12.065
Okay.

15:13.293 --> 15:14.153
Bring it in.

15:14.154 --> 15:17.231
Tom, I'm about to be
hedgehog of the house for the first time.

15:17.315 --> 15:20.019
I think I'm a little mature
to hug you goodbye.

15:20.020 --> 15:21.664
Okay, what about a power bump?

15:22.148 --> 15:24.023
- Power bump?
- Yes, power bump.

15:24.051 --> 15:25.311
That's more like it.

15:25.598 --> 15:27.434
- Wachowski!
- Wachowski!

15:27.648 --> 15:30.192
Okay, use this one to get back home.

15:31.767 --> 15:34.128
All right, we're off.
Be good.

15:34.236 --> 15:36.136
Yes.
You have our number.

15:36.137 --> 15:37.363
Sorry! Can't hear you!

15:37.364 --> 15:39.135
You're traveling through a
cross-dimensional portal!

15:39.137 --> 15:40.551
- Miss you already!
- Okay?

15:40.552 --> 15:42.387
Have fun at Rachel's wedding!

15:43.984 --> 15:46.223
Okay, it's 48 hours until they come back.

15:46.224 --> 15:50.340
We've got TV channels, streaming channels,
a house full of food and no supervision.

15:51.565 --> 15:52.648
Let's do this.

17:20.752 --> 17:23.292
If these readings are accurate, he's here.

17:23.406 --> 17:24.531
I found him!

17:24.811 --> 17:26.936
I just hope I'm not too late.

17:45.330 --> 17:46.354
He's close.

17:46.356 --> 17:48.820
I just need a way to reach him
without being spotted.

17:50.989 --> 17:53.562
Standard human transport.
Perfect.

18:05.851 --> 18:07.086
Oh, boy.

18:11.622 --> 18:13.718
Aloha!

18:14.000 --> 18:16.155
- How's it going, bud?
- Oh, you know.

18:16.156 --> 18:19.023
Just a quiet night at home,
settling in with a good book.

18:19.033 --> 18:21.992
- And you? What's up with you?
- I was just calling to say we're here.

18:22.106 --> 18:25.280
But now every word out of your mouth
is making me suspicious.

18:25.281 --> 18:25.921
What?

18:25.922 --> 18:29.856
You got to relax, buddy.
You're at the four seasons oahu.

18:29.865 --> 18:32.390
Have a Mai Tai.
Enjoy some time with your wife.

18:32.440 --> 18:34.601
Get sunburned somewhere embarrassing.

18:34.682 --> 18:36.854
This weekend is about you.

18:36.856 --> 18:39.710
You know what? You're right.
We power-bumped on it.

18:39.711 --> 18:40.999
So whatever it is you're doing,

18:41.000 --> 18:43.523
I'm sure you can undo it
by the time we get home, yeah?

18:43.535 --> 18:48.500
Exactly! I mean, I am deeply offended
by such accusations!

18:48.507 --> 18:50.030
So, how's Rachel's fiance?

18:50.106 --> 18:53.190
Is he as good-looking in person
as he is in pictures?

18:55.190 --> 18:56.506
Somehow better-looking.

18:56.507 --> 19:00.053
Wow! You're about to be
the third best-looking dude in the family.

19:00.054 --> 19:02.070
But, hey, still on the podium.

19:03.023 --> 19:05.671
All right,
I better go and introduce myself.

19:06.468 --> 19:07.569
Stay out of trouble.

19:07.570 --> 19:11.780
Trouble? Don't worry.
Everything here is completely normal.

19:11.782 --> 19:13.539
Uh-huh. Night, bud.

19:14.601 --> 19:16.367
Hey! I was just
coming over to say hi.

19:16.375 --> 19:19.421
You've got a lot of nerve coming up
in here after what you did to my fiancee.

19:20.440 --> 19:22.453
- Wait. What?
- Totaling her car?

19:22.815 --> 19:25.398
Leaving her tied to a chair?
I should rip you limb from limb.

19:29.530 --> 19:31.048
Oh, my god, look at your face!

19:31.049 --> 19:33.602
Tommy, breathe, baby. Breathe.
I was kidding.

19:33.603 --> 19:35.912
- Hey, man, I was totally kidding.
- Okay.

19:37.190 --> 19:38.898
- You were kidding.
- Yeah.

19:38.981 --> 19:42.041
I'm sorry. Rachel put me up to it.
It was totally her idea.

19:42.642 --> 19:43.938
That rascal.

19:43.939 --> 19:48.455
Listen, I don't know if you're aware.
Rachel does not care for you at all.

19:48.773 --> 19:50.213
I'm aware. Yeah.

19:50.617 --> 19:52.743
Seriously, bro, you got work to do.

19:52.857 --> 19:54.322
- Hey!
- Hey.

19:54.323 --> 19:56.691
Good to see you!
Thanks for coming, Tom.

19:56.774 --> 19:58.940
- Really glad you came.
- Really?

20:00.735 --> 20:02.690
Great to see you, too.
Congratulations.

20:02.692 --> 20:05.359
I mean, you guys, you guys
seem really happy together.

20:05.441 --> 20:07.432
You know, you're all right,
Thomas wachowski.

20:08.982 --> 20:11.674
- Can we Bury the hatchet?
- I'd love that.

20:11.675 --> 20:12.675
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

20:12.682 --> 20:15.534
- All right, bring it in!
- All right! Great.

20:16.205 --> 20:19.003
And if you screw up my wedding,
I will end you.

20:22.980 --> 20:25.846
All right, ozzy,
it's movie night at casa de Sonic,

20:25.854 --> 20:27.156
and it's your turn to pick.

20:27.232 --> 20:29.774
But I am not watching snow dogs again.

20:29.857 --> 20:32.745
That movie is the worst!

20:35.524 --> 20:36.732
Blackout!

20:38.096 --> 20:40.448
Ozzy.

20:40.982 --> 20:42.870
Sorry, buddy.
Everything's okay.

20:49.797 --> 20:53.188
Excuse me.
We did not order a poltergeist.

21:03.016 --> 21:06.821
If this is the pizza guy,
this is really unprofessional.

21:24.665 --> 21:25.915
Eggman?

21:29.191 --> 21:32.422
Hello, hedgehog.

21:33.399 --> 21:34.691
Did you miss me?

21:36.066 --> 21:40.625
I don't know how you got back,
but you made a big mistake coming here.

21:40.626 --> 21:43.587
Au contraire, mon frere.

21:43.844 --> 21:46.302
The mistake was thinking you'd won.

21:46.441 --> 21:48.941
But that was just a prelude,
an hors d'oeuvre,

21:48.943 --> 21:51.375
an aperitif, an amuse-bouche.

21:51.376 --> 21:52.735
I get it.

21:54.191 --> 21:56.109
I don't think you do.

21:56.110 --> 21:57.698
But you're about to.

21:57.774 --> 22:00.469
And so will that idiot sheriff
and his wife.

22:02.852 --> 22:04.686
And your little dog too!

22:23.614 --> 22:24.781
Pitiful.

22:25.047 --> 22:27.868
What? Who are you?

22:28.831 --> 22:32.180
Where are my manners?

22:32.399 --> 22:35.774
Sonic, meet knuckles.

22:35.776 --> 22:38.070
My new bffae.

22:38.071 --> 22:41.524
Bestest friend forever and ever!

22:41.615 --> 22:44.740
Look, robotnik, I don't care
who you brought to help you.

22:44.742 --> 22:46.672
You're never going to get my power.

22:46.732 --> 22:49.704
Do I look like I need your power?

22:59.857 --> 23:04.334
So nice when diabolical evil
lives up to the hype.

23:07.147 --> 23:08.693
Where is it?

23:08.974 --> 23:11.950
You want it?
Here it comes.

23:11.951 --> 23:16.990
I was expecting more of you.
You're unskilled.

23:17.375 --> 23:18.844
Untrained.

23:19.847 --> 23:22.662
And unworthy!

23:24.193 --> 23:27.404
You forgot one.
Unstoppable.

23:53.355 --> 23:57.167
It is my destiny
to do what my ancestors could not...

23:57.168 --> 24:01.316
To restore the ultimate power
to the home of my people.

24:02.301 --> 24:05.801
Ultimate power?
I don't know what you're talking about.

24:05.941 --> 24:07.511
You've got the wrong guy.

24:07.526 --> 24:09.566
Ultimate power?

24:09.899 --> 24:12.691
Now you're speaking my language.

24:12.693 --> 24:15.941
Don't play dumb with me,
apprentice of longclaw.

24:16.032 --> 24:17.490
You knew longclaw?

24:17.492 --> 24:21.894
Longclaw and her people were
the sworn enemy of my tribe, the echidna.

24:21.896 --> 24:27.050
We fought and died at their hands,
and now you will die at mine.

24:37.563 --> 24:39.622
Come on. Get in!
I'm on your side.

24:39.623 --> 24:41.649
I'm sorry. Who are you?

24:42.711 --> 24:44.841
You know what?
It doesn't matter.

24:47.393 --> 24:49.599
Get us out of here!
Go, go, go, go, go!

24:53.594 --> 24:54.797
He's gone rabid!

24:56.594 --> 24:58.462
Gross! Is he licking it?

24:59.274 --> 25:00.487
See ya!

25:00.609 --> 25:03.133
Make sure to get your shots, eggman!

25:16.816 --> 25:20.524
Wow. Okay. Let me just say
it is an honor to finally meet you, Sonic.

25:20.526 --> 25:22.068
Is it okay if I call you Sonic?

25:22.070 --> 25:25.026
Everyone calls me tails.
You're probably wondering why.

25:25.027 --> 25:27.389
Let me guess.
Because of the extra tail?

25:27.404 --> 25:29.597
That's right!
I should've known you'd get that.

25:29.621 --> 25:33.378
Cool. Also, what is going on?
Robotnik's back?

25:33.379 --> 25:36.347
And who is
Clifford the big red rage monster?

25:36.349 --> 25:38.424
That's knuckles, the last of the echidnas

25:38.425 --> 25:41.011
and the most dangerous warrior
in the galaxy.

25:41.058 --> 25:43.307
He's obsessed with finding
the master emerald.

25:43.308 --> 25:45.482
Are you serious?
The master emerald?

25:45.573 --> 25:47.354
That's just a bedtime story.

25:47.355 --> 25:48.894
Well, he believes it's real.

25:48.925 --> 25:51.535
And he must think
you're the key to finding it.

25:53.355 --> 25:55.107
Red light!
Give me the wheel!

25:55.109 --> 25:57.210
- Hey, what are you...
- Move your foot.

26:04.847 --> 26:06.191
I think we lost him.

26:13.969 --> 26:16.808
We did not lose him.
We definitely did not lose him!

26:22.089 --> 26:24.024
I've got an idea.
Do you trust me?

26:24.107 --> 26:26.487
Of course not!
I literally just met you!

26:26.488 --> 26:28.482
- Just let me. Come on!
- What are you doing?

26:47.513 --> 26:48.763
We're flying.

26:49.449 --> 26:51.841
Did your butt just turn into a helicopter?

26:52.805 --> 26:54.638
A butt-copter!

26:55.169 --> 26:58.503
Only Sonic the hedgehog
could come up with something like that.

27:13.686 --> 27:16.037
Foxy move.

27:16.941 --> 27:18.982
You want something done right...

27:20.336 --> 27:23.560
You have to hire someone
you can push around.

27:25.482 --> 27:26.482
All caps.

27:44.691 --> 27:48.418
Doctor, where are you?

27:55.121 --> 27:56.254
Freak.

28:04.102 --> 28:06.180
I, I'm sorry, folks.

28:06.188 --> 28:08.907
I have to close early.
Everybody out!

28:09.105 --> 28:12.147
Everybody out.
Thank you for visiting the mean bean.

28:12.149 --> 28:14.347
All right, good night.
Good night.

28:33.451 --> 28:34.779
He's back.

28:36.107 --> 28:38.466
He's back!

29:32.852 --> 29:35.258
That's more like it.

29:36.107 --> 29:39.110
I've been re-hatched!

29:50.763 --> 29:54.997
So, my massively metacarpaled friend,

29:55.006 --> 29:55.982
you mentioned...

29:55.983 --> 30:00.324
Ultimate power.

30:00.480 --> 30:01.630
Back at the house?

30:01.896 --> 30:03.333
The master emerald?

30:03.334 --> 30:04.573
It does not concern you.

30:04.656 --> 30:07.656
I got you off that planet
and you brought me to the hedgehog.

30:07.801 --> 30:09.926
We have no more use for each other.

30:09.941 --> 30:12.623
Well, I hate to be a contrarian, but...

30:13.191 --> 30:14.316
I think we might.

30:15.935 --> 30:18.273
You think these machines
are a match for me?

30:18.349 --> 30:22.216
I will shatter them
like the bones from a fallen...

30:22.691 --> 30:24.084
They are stairs.

30:29.516 --> 30:34.060
You see, earth is my turf, g.

30:34.191 --> 30:36.941
If you don't know how to floss,
you'll be lost without me.

30:36.943 --> 30:39.888
I understand nothing
of what you just said.

30:39.895 --> 30:44.164
I help you retrieve the emerald,
and you use it to...

30:45.308 --> 30:50.990
Destroy the hedgehog!

30:50.992 --> 30:53.106
You're suggesting an alliance.

30:53.107 --> 30:57.170
Around here we simply
grip each other's hands tightly.

31:02.357 --> 31:06.200
You truculent space bumpkin!

31:06.201 --> 31:08.740
You've crushed my favorite hand!

31:08.899 --> 31:11.162
Really?
My hand is uninjured.

31:12.232 --> 31:14.622
But I'm now convinced of your commitment.

31:14.623 --> 31:16.274
"Oh, goody,"

31:16.357 --> 31:19.857
he exclaimed,
while he reset two of his knuckles.

31:19.867 --> 31:22.138
I'm...

31:22.349 --> 31:27.755
Delighted to be on the same team.

31:35.270 --> 31:36.562
Road trip!

31:37.107 --> 31:39.149
I'll let you stick your nose
out the window.

31:41.357 --> 31:43.107
Sonic, where are we?

31:43.272 --> 31:45.647
Welcome to the Wade cave.

31:45.649 --> 31:48.691
Which is something
I hope to someday say to a woman.

31:48.774 --> 31:50.441
A woman who's not my mom.

31:50.849 --> 31:52.564
Wade, focus.

31:52.566 --> 31:56.274
We need to figure out why knuckles thinks
I'm the key to finding the master emerald.

31:56.357 --> 31:58.274
And why did he mention longclaw?

31:59.138 --> 32:01.529
There must be a connection.

32:01.700 --> 32:03.107
Wait a minute.
There is.

32:03.649 --> 32:07.566
Look. There's an emerald symbol
on the map longclaw gave me.

32:07.646 --> 32:09.524
I never knew what it meant before.

32:10.232 --> 32:11.899
Something's happening.

32:25.082 --> 32:26.457
Longclaw?

32:26.459 --> 32:28.001
Hello, Sonic.

32:28.157 --> 32:31.532
If you're watching this,
then something has happened to me.

32:31.608 --> 32:34.442
And I pray
you've made it to earth unharmed.

32:35.024 --> 32:39.315
This world has been chosen
for a very important reason.

32:39.317 --> 32:43.473
It's the secret location
of the master emerald.

32:45.067 --> 32:49.114
The emerald has the power
to turn thoughts into reality.

32:49.536 --> 32:52.505
Like the stay puft marshmallow man
from ghostbusters.

32:52.512 --> 32:56.574
In the wrong hands it could threaten
all life in the universe.

32:56.650 --> 32:59.567
Protecting the emerald was my sacred duty.

32:59.650 --> 33:03.622
And now I must pass
that responsibility to you.

33:04.442 --> 33:07.108
This is my moment.

33:07.332 --> 33:11.145
Follow the map, find the emerald,
and keep it safe.

33:11.275 --> 33:12.817
My dear Sonic,

33:12.907 --> 33:16.184
you have a heart
like no creature I've ever known.

33:16.491 --> 33:18.223
I love you so much.

33:19.809 --> 33:21.025
Goodbye.

33:22.715 --> 33:24.481
No, no, no, wait.

33:31.317 --> 33:33.497
I won't let you down, longclaw.

33:35.231 --> 33:38.398
So is that you, your dad?

33:38.400 --> 33:39.598
What?

33:39.942 --> 33:40.942
No?

33:41.692 --> 33:44.839
According to this map,
the first clue is in Siberia.

33:44.840 --> 33:46.981
It's a compass
that will lead to the emerald.

33:47.064 --> 33:49.981
And with knuckles already here,
it's a race.

33:49.983 --> 33:51.278
Knuckles?

33:51.733 --> 33:53.511
I knew a kid in middle school
named knuckles.

33:53.512 --> 33:55.442
Could fit his whole fist in his mouth.

33:55.700 --> 33:59.532
If this is the same knuckles,
we are screwed.

33:59.534 --> 34:02.098
This knuckles, that knuckles.
It doesn't matter.

34:02.163 --> 34:03.830
We're gonna get there first.

34:06.900 --> 34:08.902
What do you mean, "we"?

34:08.902 --> 34:09.911
You're coming with me.

34:10.458 --> 34:11.458
No, no, no, no, no.

34:11.525 --> 34:14.893
I just came here to warn you.
I'm not a field guy.

34:14.895 --> 34:18.981
Don't worry. I got your back.
I won't let anything happen to you.

34:20.108 --> 34:24.324
It's a power bump.
On earth, it means an unbreakable promise.

34:24.331 --> 34:26.981
Okay, I'm in.

34:42.318 --> 34:45.038
Doctor. It's really you.

34:45.650 --> 34:47.444
You look different.

34:47.817 --> 34:50.786
Papa's got a brand new 'stache.

34:53.690 --> 34:57.315
I knew it. I knew it!
I knew you'd come back, sir.

34:57.317 --> 35:00.022
I never stopped steaming
your Austrian goat's milk.

35:05.692 --> 35:07.025
Could use some mushroom.

35:08.900 --> 35:10.372
You brought something.

35:10.832 --> 35:13.801
Some kind of space porcupine.

35:14.108 --> 35:17.108
Porcupine?
I am an echidna!

35:17.192 --> 35:19.941
Trained since birth
in all forms of lethal combat,

35:19.942 --> 35:22.254
destined to restore honor to my tribe,

35:22.255 --> 35:26.075
and willing to destroy
anything that gets in my way.

35:26.567 --> 35:27.942
Welcome to the team.

35:34.150 --> 35:36.486
That means he trusts you, stone.

35:36.692 --> 35:39.642
Now let's renovate this dump!

35:40.067 --> 35:42.572
Latte with steamed Austrian goat milk!

36:02.733 --> 36:04.217
Good one. Solid.

36:11.192 --> 36:12.944
- Sorry, fellas.
- That's game!

36:13.649 --> 36:15.655
That's how we do!
That's how we do!

36:15.657 --> 36:18.811
- But are they good at math?
- Teamwork makes the dream work!

36:18.858 --> 36:20.631
Sorry about that, big Tom.

36:20.825 --> 36:22.725
- Are you good?
- All good. Fine.

36:22.733 --> 36:26.107
Hey. Thanks for inviting me out to hang
with you and your groomsmen.

36:26.108 --> 36:28.061
Good quality bonding.

36:28.063 --> 36:29.465
You know, bro,

36:29.483 --> 36:31.983
those guys right there,
they're way more than my groomsmen.

36:32.067 --> 36:33.427
That's my squad.

36:33.428 --> 36:35.232
Never would've made it through life
without 'em.

36:35.233 --> 36:36.442
Get over here!

36:36.517 --> 36:38.342
Yeah, I'm coming! I'm coming!

36:38.894 --> 36:41.880
- I'll catch you later.
- Hey. Yeah!

36:41.881 --> 36:44.193
Let me know if you're ready
for some power yoga.

36:44.194 --> 36:46.344
- You bet.
- Come on, Tommy boy. Let's go.

36:46.345 --> 36:47.004
Let's go.

36:47.006 --> 36:48.150
Don't make me.

36:49.233 --> 36:50.317
What am I doing?

36:50.319 --> 36:51.611
Hey, uncle Tommy!

36:51.775 --> 36:53.490
Hey, girls!

36:53.491 --> 36:54.701
How you do.

36:54.835 --> 36:56.700
- Are those the wedding rings?
- Uh-huh.

36:56.701 --> 36:57.631
May I?

36:57.632 --> 37:01.416
This little ring bearer
has been taking her job very seriously.

37:01.423 --> 37:03.819
- She's been practicing all morning.
- I can see that.

37:03.821 --> 37:06.108
How very responsible of you.

37:06.110 --> 37:08.190
Except aren't there supposed
to be two wedding rings?

37:08.608 --> 37:09.733
Uh-oh.

37:10.974 --> 37:14.850
- Uncle Tommy?
- Hang on. What's going on here?

37:16.817 --> 37:18.249
You're gonna do great, kiddo.

37:18.256 --> 37:19.158
Bye.

37:19.160 --> 37:20.756
- Hey, baby.
- Hi.

37:23.725 --> 37:26.130
That's right!
Groom in the building!

37:26.131 --> 37:27.639
Look at those guys.

37:27.865 --> 37:29.671
I wish Sonic had that.

37:29.817 --> 37:32.249
- Muscles?
- Control yourself.

37:33.108 --> 37:36.733
No. Buddies.
Wingmen. A squad.

37:36.967 --> 37:40.647
Sonic doesn't have anything like that.
He's flying solo.

37:41.280 --> 37:43.576
Baby, you got to relax.

37:43.577 --> 37:45.349
You're at the four seasons.

37:45.350 --> 37:48.935
Have a Mai Tai.
Spend some time with your wife.

37:48.936 --> 37:51.959
That's what he said.
Seriously, his exact words.

37:51.960 --> 37:55.975
See? He's a smart kid.
He'll find his way.

37:56.366 --> 37:59.373
I absolutely cannot find my way.

37:59.374 --> 38:03.163
We are completely, totally,
unequivocally lost.

38:04.301 --> 38:05.855
Sonic, in this weather,

38:05.856 --> 38:08.717
there's no way we're gonna get
any readings on this thing!

38:08.934 --> 38:10.826
- Should we go back?
- No, no, no.

38:10.827 --> 38:14.467
There's a light up ahead.
Maybe we can take shelter in there.

38:19.608 --> 38:20.841
Perfect.

38:20.842 --> 38:23.949
Are you sure about this?
We don't know who's inside.

38:24.033 --> 38:27.283
Don't worry.
On earth, people are very welcoming,

38:27.285 --> 38:31.038
and love taking complete strangers
into their homes.

39:01.009 --> 39:02.009
Run.

39:04.483 --> 39:06.067
Table for two, please!

39:08.273 --> 39:10.755
What would you like to order?

39:10.756 --> 39:12.460
Two beef stews, please.

39:17.575 --> 39:20.881
- Where'd you get all these cool gadgets?
- I invented 'em.

39:20.942 --> 39:22.858
That's kinda my thing.

39:22.942 --> 39:25.796
In fact,
my inventions are how I discovered you.

39:26.233 --> 39:28.912
Remember that night at the baseball field?

39:28.913 --> 39:32.358
Your energy blast reached all the way
to my home planet.

39:32.442 --> 39:37.067
I saw you save your whole village
from that crazy mustache guy.

39:37.157 --> 39:40.365
Wait, so you've been watching me
this whole time?

39:40.480 --> 39:42.063
Even in the shower?

39:42.436 --> 39:44.048
That's a trick question.

39:44.050 --> 39:46.459
Sonic the hedgehog prefers bubble baths.

39:46.460 --> 39:47.880
Man, you're good!

39:47.881 --> 39:50.275
When I learned knuckles was on your trail,

39:50.440 --> 39:53.315
I knew I couldn't just sit back
and watch anymore.

39:53.317 --> 39:55.053
I had to come warn you.

39:56.210 --> 39:57.990
What? Hang on one sec.

39:57.991 --> 39:59.561
Donut lord is checking in.

40:01.449 --> 40:05.327
"Just chilling. Watching TV."

40:05.483 --> 40:07.394
Dot, dot, dot.

40:07.942 --> 40:10.067
Dot, dot, dot.

40:10.824 --> 40:12.841
Dot, dot, dot.

40:12.889 --> 40:14.741
Dot, dot, dot.

40:14.983 --> 40:17.567
Dot, dot, dot.

40:18.067 --> 40:19.067
Doctor,

40:20.067 --> 40:22.788
why are we working with this imbecile?

40:23.733 --> 40:28.678
Because that simpleminded space trash
is the key to something extraordinary.

40:29.233 --> 40:32.163
Something to help you get revenge
on the hedgehog.

40:32.275 --> 40:33.842
Think bigger, stone.

40:34.067 --> 40:37.400
The emerald he seeks
could power my wildest designs.

40:37.483 --> 40:40.053
My genius wouldn't just
be recognized on earth.

40:40.061 --> 40:43.060
It would spread virally
to every corner of the galaxy,

40:43.061 --> 40:46.671
allowing me to harness
all the negative forces of the universe

40:47.074 --> 40:49.324
and commune with darkness itself.

40:49.400 --> 40:52.296
Wow. That sounds big.

40:52.442 --> 40:55.608
It's been on my vision board for years.
It's the law of attraction.

40:55.692 --> 40:57.171
Didn't you see the secret?

40:58.358 --> 41:00.404
Kaplooey!

41:00.475 --> 41:01.517
Kaplooey.

41:01.608 --> 41:04.990
"Another boring night at home."

41:04.991 --> 41:06.907
The hedgehog has returned home!

41:06.983 --> 41:10.616
Falsa.
Which is Latin for "wrong-o."

41:11.150 --> 41:15.678
According to my worldwide network
cell tower triangulation, he's lying,

41:16.067 --> 41:17.600
all the way

41:18.275 --> 41:22.624
from the majestic hinterlands
of eastern Siberia.

41:23.283 --> 41:26.600
He's a long-distance liar!

41:30.858 --> 41:33.405
Yeah, there's more where that came from.

41:35.442 --> 41:38.046
Tiny magic hedgehog destroyed.

41:38.900 --> 41:41.116
Now let's begin our quest.

41:43.817 --> 41:44.983
Wait.

41:45.121 --> 41:48.006
What about your Minion?
The goat milker.

41:48.232 --> 41:50.565
There's no room on the ship for stone.

41:50.567 --> 41:53.358
I say we ditch him,
ghost him, blow him off.

41:53.538 --> 41:54.788
Dishonor!

41:55.817 --> 41:58.874
"Dis" is how I roll.

42:06.866 --> 42:10.061
I'm sorry, but I asked for the beef stew.

42:10.139 --> 42:13.275
Your breath smells like goat poop.

42:14.009 --> 42:15.881
What did you say?

42:19.944 --> 42:21.358
What's going on?

42:21.983 --> 42:24.850
Maybe they think it's my birthday?

42:25.439 --> 42:28.981
Don't worry, I'll take care of this.
Okay, everybody, take it easy.

42:28.983 --> 42:31.025
I'm sure there's
a perfectly good explanation

42:31.027 --> 42:33.671
for whatever my friend said or did.

42:34.177 --> 42:35.274
Stand back.

42:35.483 --> 42:36.900
I just farted.

42:42.348 --> 42:43.521
Meow?

42:43.522 --> 42:45.850
Throw these monsters in the fire!

42:49.525 --> 42:53.022
Oh, no, no. Come on, guys.
Take it easy. Let's talk this through.

42:53.193 --> 42:54.631
Let's talk this through!

42:55.866 --> 42:58.272
Come on, come on.
Scanning siberian customs.

42:58.764 --> 43:02.150
- There's got to be something in here.
- Tails, whatever you're doing, do it fast.

43:02.342 --> 43:03.275
I think I got it!

43:03.358 --> 43:05.567
Pivonka!
Pivonka!

43:05.842 --> 43:08.155
Pivonka!

43:35.442 --> 43:36.442
Da.

43:36.983 --> 43:38.239
Pivonka!

43:39.817 --> 43:42.160
Tails, what's a "pivonka"?

43:42.161 --> 43:45.066
It's a siberian custom
to resolve disputes.

43:45.067 --> 43:47.825
If we win, they let us go.
If we lose...

43:53.362 --> 43:55.322
Okay, we have to grab the
map and get out of here.

43:55.705 --> 43:56.565
Where's the map?

43:56.567 --> 43:59.459
Oh, no. I left it on the table!
Look!

44:07.108 --> 44:08.233
What?

44:31.428 --> 44:34.311
Oh, my god, it's a dance fight.

44:35.913 --> 44:37.692
Sonic, what do we do?

44:37.783 --> 44:40.413
We dance and get that map.

44:42.202 --> 44:43.311
Here we go.

44:45.710 --> 44:48.050
Okay, now let's do.
No, we're gonna go...

44:55.037 --> 44:56.326
Okay.

45:05.034 --> 45:09.076
Okay, this is not going well.
Channing Tatum makes it look so easy.

45:09.151 --> 45:10.896
Wait, Sonic. Look!

45:15.667 --> 45:17.878
The map!
Come on, let's grab it!

45:21.484 --> 45:23.010
You want?

45:23.276 --> 45:24.706
Come get.

45:25.464 --> 45:26.464
Freaks!

45:27.193 --> 45:28.642
Freaks!

45:28.643 --> 45:30.828
Freaks! Freaks! Freaks!

45:30.943 --> 45:33.109
Freaks! Freaks! Freaks!

45:33.111 --> 45:35.400
Freaks! Freaks! Freaks!

45:35.401 --> 45:37.032
Freaks! Freaks! Freaks!

45:37.034 --> 45:39.609
What's wrong, tails?
Come on. I need you!

45:39.693 --> 45:42.609
I can't do this, Sonic.
I'm not brave like you.

45:42.693 --> 45:45.359
My gadget got us in this mess,
and I lost your map,

45:45.369 --> 45:47.831
and we're gonna get tossed into a fire!

45:52.541 --> 45:54.456
New deejay coming in.

45:57.359 --> 45:59.359
Come on, pal.
I got an idea.

45:59.643 --> 46:01.487
They called us freaks,

46:02.081 --> 46:03.831
so let's get freaky.

46:04.284 --> 46:06.714
Just follow my moves.
You'll be fine.

46:34.741 --> 46:37.547
All right!
Backup dancers!

46:41.992 --> 46:43.226
Here we go!

47:04.463 --> 47:07.237
There's a lot of me up here!

47:12.318 --> 47:14.893
I love pivonka!

47:17.534 --> 47:21.339
And big dismount!

47:23.159 --> 47:24.159
Yeah!

47:27.818 --> 47:29.315
I'll take that.

47:34.651 --> 47:35.910
We did it!

47:35.947 --> 47:39.276
That was amazing!
Way to go, tails.

47:47.888 --> 47:52.581
Wow. Only Sonic the hedgehog
could win a dance battle that epic.

47:52.588 --> 47:53.825
Well, stick with me, pal.

47:53.827 --> 47:57.827
Earth can be a scary place, but I know
everything about this old pale blue dot.

47:57.984 --> 47:59.693
Do you really mean that?

47:59.776 --> 48:03.359
I mean, not everything. But I watch
a lot of discovery channel and...

48:03.369 --> 48:06.244
I meant about me being your pal.

48:07.943 --> 48:09.359
Of course, buddy.

48:12.651 --> 48:14.253
Comin' in hot.

48:14.568 --> 48:17.276
Growing up, I didn't have any friends.

48:17.366 --> 48:20.283
Everyone in my village
thought my two tails were weird.

48:20.359 --> 48:22.109
Hey, I know that feeling.

48:22.111 --> 48:26.152
But then I saw you,
the fastest creature in the galaxy.

48:26.318 --> 48:30.409
You were weird too.
But you were a legend.

48:30.693 --> 48:34.339
That made me think,
maybe being weird isn't so bad.

48:34.341 --> 48:37.518
You inspired me to leave my village,

48:37.568 --> 48:40.241
to find you and help you in your mission.

48:41.109 --> 48:42.901
I'm really glad you're here, tails.

48:43.378 --> 48:45.221
I'm glad I'm here too, Sonic.

48:50.859 --> 48:53.995
Well, might as well get some sleep.

48:54.003 --> 48:56.220
This feels like a good place
to spend the night.

48:56.221 --> 48:58.220
You'll be able to get clear readings
on your gizmo thing

48:58.221 --> 49:00.495
once the storm is over, so I...

49:12.568 --> 49:14.135
Night, tails.

49:27.818 --> 49:31.115
Tails. Tails.
We have a situation.

49:37.721 --> 49:40.633
Today's forecast calls for
clear, sunny skies

49:40.634 --> 49:43.609
and a 100% chance of adventure.

49:43.618 --> 49:47.076
I pinpointed the coordinates.
It's right up ahead.

50:00.870 --> 50:02.440
Hey, tails. Wait up.

50:07.554 --> 50:12.464
Okay, we got a giant owl door.
Seems encouraging.

50:25.193 --> 50:26.426
Check this out.

50:26.427 --> 50:29.412
- Can you translate that?
- Yeah.

50:30.724 --> 50:33.834
Ages ago, a fearsome group of warriors,

50:33.841 --> 50:35.408
known as the echidnas,

50:35.410 --> 50:37.763
forged the seven chaos emeralds

50:37.859 --> 50:41.779
into the most unstoppable weapon
ever created.

50:44.787 --> 50:46.526
The master emerald.

50:46.609 --> 50:49.278
With it, a single warrior

50:49.279 --> 50:51.896
could defeat entire armies.

50:54.109 --> 50:56.802
Believing no one should have such power,

50:57.552 --> 51:00.138
an order of heroes recovered the emerald

51:00.443 --> 51:03.146
and swore to protect it from evil.

51:04.383 --> 51:05.941
Sounds like the owls and the echidnas

51:05.943 --> 51:08.401
have been fighting each other
for centuries.

51:08.484 --> 51:10.552
Like vin diesel and the rock.

51:12.237 --> 51:13.537
Wait for me.

51:20.068 --> 51:24.318
Okay, giant owl door, giant owl.
Makes sense.

51:35.601 --> 51:38.584
Wait a second.
I've seen these symbols before.

51:42.599 --> 51:44.021
Here we go.

51:52.443 --> 51:54.029
Well, that did something.

52:11.541 --> 52:14.745
- The compass!
- This will lead us to the emerald!

52:20.275 --> 52:22.816
Hey, you got a little something on your...

52:22.818 --> 52:25.604
Oh, no. Tails, get back.

52:30.307 --> 52:31.346
Run!

52:38.659 --> 52:39.720
That guy again?

52:39.721 --> 52:43.234
Heads up, my little stalagmites.
Someone call an uber?

52:43.318 --> 52:46.956
Hey, thanks for doing all the hard stuff.

52:50.026 --> 52:52.151
But we'll take it from here.

52:52.604 --> 52:54.734
Okay, we really gotta talk
about your new look.

52:54.736 --> 52:57.623
It's like professor x
meets the monopoly man.

52:57.651 --> 53:01.393
And what kind of genius
shows up to Siberia in a convertible?

53:01.401 --> 53:04.401
The kind of genius
that can turn up the heat...

53:06.161 --> 53:08.065
With a flick of a switch.

53:19.655 --> 53:22.234
Good one!
I'm sure that wasn't important.

53:24.533 --> 53:26.882
Tails, that's our exit.
Come on.

53:40.846 --> 53:41.846
Let's split up.

53:41.901 --> 53:44.401
- You go high, I go low.
- Right.

53:44.484 --> 53:47.362
Quick little stretch and here we go.

53:58.818 --> 54:00.358
So you want to play?

54:05.435 --> 54:06.896
That's new.

54:17.968 --> 54:19.257
Sonic!

54:32.521 --> 54:34.006
Snowball fight!

54:39.380 --> 54:43.381
It's too easy.
Come on, challenge me!

54:57.359 --> 55:00.474
We are talking style and pizzazz.

55:07.693 --> 55:10.506
Yeah!
I make this look good.

55:12.776 --> 55:15.209
Oh, great. The winter soldier.

55:21.901 --> 55:25.232
For a guy named knuckles,
you are really bad at punching.

55:25.318 --> 55:28.109
Surrender the compass!
You are no match for me.

55:28.111 --> 55:30.650
I've been training for this
my entire life.

55:30.651 --> 55:34.276
And I had no training at all,
yet here I am ahead of you.

55:34.359 --> 55:36.552
That's gotta be embarrassing.

55:42.966 --> 55:44.388
My rings!

55:47.151 --> 55:50.787
Has anyone ever told you
you've got serious anger issues?

55:50.796 --> 55:53.255
You mock me with your weak jokes,

55:53.256 --> 55:55.526
but you know nothing about me, hedgehog.

55:55.528 --> 55:59.919
Well, I know you echidnas have a habit of
showing up uninvited and ruining my life.

55:59.920 --> 56:03.116
Ruining your life?
Another bad joke.

56:03.118 --> 56:06.294
I lost everything because of you.

56:06.295 --> 56:09.401
My tribe was on the verge
of its greatest victory.

56:09.566 --> 56:12.441
The last of the owl warriors
had been located.

56:12.443 --> 56:16.193
Soon longclaw's emerald secrets
would be ours.

56:16.284 --> 56:19.857
But my father stopped me
from joining the fight.

56:19.880 --> 56:23.132
He said my moment
to honor our tribe would come,

56:23.193 --> 56:25.669
but it was not this moment.

56:25.670 --> 56:28.026
Those were the last words he spoke to me.

56:28.529 --> 56:30.670
I never saw him again.

56:32.107 --> 56:34.568
We both lost everything that day.

56:36.763 --> 56:38.700
- Goodbye, Sonic.
- No!

56:38.701 --> 56:40.403
Longclaw!

56:44.776 --> 56:46.651
Sonic! Are you okay?

56:46.653 --> 56:47.966
Deceiver!

56:48.873 --> 56:51.115
No, it wasn't a trick.

56:51.450 --> 56:54.276
Tails, take the compass
and get out of here!

56:57.234 --> 56:58.776
Yeah!

56:59.568 --> 57:01.825
Later, haters!

57:04.818 --> 57:05.943
Tails!

57:13.015 --> 57:14.599
Tails, come on. Wake up.

57:14.737 --> 57:17.445
He chose helping the fox
over pursuing the compass.

57:17.569 --> 57:21.921
Of course he did.
New friend, same pathetic weakness.

57:32.027 --> 57:35.358
Oh, no. No, no, no.
We're in real trouble here.

57:35.366 --> 57:37.153
Come on, tails.
I need you to fly us out of here.

57:37.160 --> 57:38.616
Time to wake up.

57:45.796 --> 57:48.915
See ya, kids.
Enjoy the fresh powder.

58:14.110 --> 58:15.194
Did you...

58:20.835 --> 58:23.749
These rings signify the...

58:29.585 --> 58:30.694
Sorry.

58:31.124 --> 58:32.647
Thought it was on silent.

58:39.069 --> 58:40.491
These rings...

58:42.573 --> 58:44.163
So help me, Thomas!

58:48.913 --> 58:50.192
Okay, sorry, sorry.

58:50.194 --> 58:52.092
Excuse me, this is an emergency.

58:53.461 --> 58:54.624
Sorry.

59:00.303 --> 59:02.655
What? This better be important.
I just...

59:03.233 --> 59:04.233
Are you skiing?

59:04.235 --> 59:06.485
Snowboarding, actually.
But I need your help now.

59:06.487 --> 59:08.881
Life or death situation this very second.

59:08.882 --> 59:11.006
I need you to use the ring
I gave you to save me.

59:11.007 --> 59:12.210
Like right now.

59:12.212 --> 59:14.506
Okay, slow down.
I don't even know where you are.

59:14.507 --> 59:16.670
You just gotta picture
where you want the ring to go.

59:16.671 --> 59:18.069
So picture this.

59:20.655 --> 59:23.632
Oh, my god. Okay, okay.
Hang on.

59:31.850 --> 59:32.850
What?

59:34.196 --> 59:35.444
Did you throw it?

59:36.402 --> 59:38.599
- Oh, god.
- What? Tell me what "oh, god."

59:38.600 --> 59:40.623
I mixed up the rings
when I was teasing jojo.

59:40.624 --> 59:42.288
What? Where is it then?
Where is it then?

59:46.444 --> 59:47.444
You don't want to know.

59:47.631 --> 59:48.857
But I do, Tom.

59:48.858 --> 59:50.327
I very much want to know,

59:50.328 --> 59:52.902
before I become
a hedgehog-flavored snow cone.

59:52.985 --> 59:54.974
Hang tight, buddy.
I got this.

59:54.975 --> 59:56.944
With this ring, Rachel...

59:57.389 --> 59:58.819
Hey! Hi.

01:00:00.100 --> 01:00:01.389
Everything okay, bud?

01:00:01.617 --> 01:00:02.873
- Not really.
- What are you doing?

01:00:02.874 --> 01:00:06.702
This is gonna sound crazy, but I need to see
that ring for just one second, one second.

01:00:06.704 --> 01:00:09.387
- Have you lost your mind?
- I'm gonna give it right back, I promise.

01:00:09.388 --> 01:00:12.084
- Please, Randall, it's really important.
- No, bro. Go sit down.

01:00:12.085 --> 01:00:14.873
- Give me the ring, please?
- Randall, don't look at him, look at me.

01:00:14.874 --> 01:00:15.460
Randall, Randall.

01:00:15.461 --> 01:00:17.115
- One second.
- Put the ring on my finger.

01:00:17.116 --> 01:00:20.170
- No, Randall, listen to me.
- Randall! Look at me. Ring on my finger.

01:00:20.171 --> 01:00:22.902
- Give me the ring! Just one second.
- Put a ring on it!

01:00:23.652 --> 01:00:25.027
Please, love? Okay?

01:00:25.110 --> 01:00:25.850
With this ring...

01:00:25.851 --> 01:00:27.796
- Yes, baby.
- I'm so sorry about this.

01:00:38.032 --> 01:00:40.336
- Snow, my god.
- Oh, boy.

01:00:41.149 --> 01:00:43.852
Incoming!

01:00:54.027 --> 01:00:55.444
Anybody hurt?

01:00:55.660 --> 01:00:57.792
- Sonic!
- Hawaii.

01:00:57.793 --> 01:00:58.793
Are you okay?

01:00:58.910 --> 01:01:00.860
What's happening?
Are you hurt?

01:01:00.944 --> 01:01:03.260
- No, no, no, I'm fine.
- Okay, good.

01:01:03.261 --> 01:01:06.527
- Because you're in so much trouble!
- Okay, you calm down.

01:01:06.610 --> 01:01:07.944
You talk.

01:01:08.027 --> 01:01:09.444
Okay, quick version.

01:01:09.527 --> 01:01:12.933
Robotnik is back on earth
and he's after a magic emerald.

01:01:13.860 --> 01:01:16.715
We need to get it back
or the world is doomed.

01:01:17.110 --> 01:01:18.135
Tails!

01:01:18.136 --> 01:01:21.893
- Wait! All this happened since yesterday?
- Wait. Who's tails?

01:01:21.894 --> 01:01:23.011
Tails, can you hear me?

01:01:23.472 --> 01:01:25.065
Oh, lord, there are two of them now.

01:01:25.066 --> 01:01:27.842
Okay, okay, let me think, let me think.
Tails, come on, buddy.

01:01:32.053 --> 01:01:32.886
Hey!

01:01:32.980 --> 01:01:36.355
Randall, why do all of your friends
have weapons?

01:01:38.183 --> 01:01:41.761
You really should have taken me up
on that brunch, Mr. and Mrs. Wachowski.

01:01:41.944 --> 01:01:42.985
Olive garden guy?

01:01:42.987 --> 01:01:45.824
It's okay, everyone.
We're federal agents.

01:01:46.907 --> 01:01:49.035
You, too, agent. Go ahead.

01:01:55.360 --> 01:01:59.444
You mean to tell me
that this entire wedding was a setup?

01:01:59.527 --> 01:02:01.393
- Rachel, wait a minute.
- What?

01:02:01.394 --> 01:02:02.347
That's correct, ma'am.

01:02:02.348 --> 01:02:06.230
Every single aspect of operation catfish
was a complete fabrication.

01:02:07.027 --> 01:02:08.972
Operation catfish?

01:02:09.277 --> 01:02:11.316
So is everyone here an agent?

01:02:12.264 --> 01:02:13.824
Are you an agent?

01:02:14.389 --> 01:02:15.754
Son of a...

01:02:15.985 --> 01:02:19.319
Was the florist an agent?
How about the photographer?

01:02:19.944 --> 01:02:21.707
The woman who waxed my...

01:02:22.444 --> 01:02:23.738
At the spa?

01:02:25.324 --> 01:02:27.652
- Is jojo an agent?
- Rachel.

01:02:28.154 --> 01:02:30.279
- What?
- Rachel, listen to me.

01:02:30.286 --> 01:02:33.699
I'm done listening!
I am done listening!

01:02:33.902 --> 01:02:36.902
I am so sorry.
I am so sorry.

01:02:37.015 --> 01:02:38.879
I really am.
I am so sorry.

01:02:40.965 --> 01:02:42.636
No. Hey, no!

01:02:43.647 --> 01:02:46.144
Let him go! Hey!

01:02:48.694 --> 01:02:50.113
Sonic, hang on.

01:02:50.905 --> 01:02:53.371
- Take it easy. It's not worth it.
- Tom!

01:02:53.985 --> 01:02:56.698
Sonic is not a threat.
He's on our side.

01:02:56.699 --> 01:02:58.569
He's an uncontrolled extraterrestrial.

01:02:58.652 --> 01:03:01.144
And your days of aiding
and abetting him are over.

01:03:01.485 --> 01:03:03.894
Secure them in the hotel
until the chopper arrives.

01:03:04.277 --> 01:03:05.527
You're making a mistake.

01:03:05.610 --> 01:03:07.379
Hold on, major a-hole!

01:03:07.900 --> 01:03:09.784
This is still my day,

01:03:09.785 --> 01:03:13.307
and someone is gonna explain to me
what the hell is going on here!

01:03:13.308 --> 01:03:17.018
After the events in San Francisco,
a global task force was created,

01:03:17.019 --> 01:03:19.902
devoted to protecting our planet
from alien threats.

01:03:19.904 --> 01:03:22.683
That day,
guardian units of nations was born.

01:03:22.980 --> 01:03:25.503
- G-u-n. Seriously?
- Gun, yeah.

01:03:25.504 --> 01:03:28.566
Look, what about protecting our planet
from Dr. Robotnik?

01:03:29.319 --> 01:03:30.694
Robotnik is dead.

01:03:30.696 --> 01:03:32.821
You're wrong.
He's back.

01:03:32.977 --> 01:03:35.535
And you just hauled away the only ones
who could stop him.

01:03:38.498 --> 01:03:40.339
Sounds like robotnik
might be back in play.

01:03:40.340 --> 01:03:43.011
If he is, I want him found immediately.

01:03:44.006 --> 01:03:46.410
And cancel my five o'clock
at the olive garden.

01:03:46.957 --> 01:03:48.442
- Aunt maddie?
- Yeah.

01:03:48.444 --> 01:03:50.199
Sonic and his friend dropped this.

01:03:57.046 --> 01:03:58.360
I have an idea.

01:03:58.460 --> 01:04:00.626
And I want to have a word with my fiance.

01:04:00.763 --> 01:04:02.647
And that word is "murder."

01:04:07.777 --> 01:04:09.819
Hey, come on.
You can't just leave us in here.

01:04:09.902 --> 01:04:13.514
My friend is hurt!
He needs a doctor, a vet, anyone!

01:04:14.485 --> 01:04:17.733
Tails, you got to wake up, buddy.
Please wake up.

01:04:25.882 --> 01:04:27.014
All clear.

01:04:30.360 --> 01:04:31.944
All right. Game plan.

01:04:32.027 --> 01:04:34.716
I get inside the hotel and find
where they're hiding Tom and Sonic.

01:04:34.717 --> 01:04:36.694
Okay.
Then I find Randall, right?

01:04:36.696 --> 01:04:38.365
And then I squeeze the breath

01:04:38.366 --> 01:04:42.858
from his lying, deceitful,
perfectly manscaped body!

01:04:44.816 --> 01:04:46.525
I'm going through a lot right now.

01:04:46.535 --> 01:04:49.913
- So let me process this my own way, okay?
- Sure, sure.

01:04:50.277 --> 01:04:51.873
- No judgment.
- Should've brought a journal.

01:04:51.874 --> 01:04:53.046
Okay...

01:04:53.499 --> 01:04:57.366
Okay. Is this meant to be a weapon?
This is adorable.

01:04:58.178 --> 01:04:59.655
Take that, Randall!

01:05:00.003 --> 01:05:01.388
Run, Randall!

01:05:01.526 --> 01:05:02.942
All right.

01:05:03.303 --> 01:05:05.154
- We're about to find out.
- All right!

01:05:05.155 --> 01:05:07.069
Let's go kick some Booty.

01:05:20.156 --> 01:05:21.983
Rachel! No. Rachel!

01:05:22.899 --> 01:05:24.163
In a minute.

01:05:29.975 --> 01:05:31.092
Stop right there!

01:05:31.451 --> 01:05:32.545
Get the bag.

01:05:41.162 --> 01:05:42.451
He's gonna come back down, right?

01:05:42.453 --> 01:05:43.806
I don't know.

01:05:44.069 --> 01:05:45.132
Good luck!

01:05:47.514 --> 01:05:50.053
Look. Tom and Sonic
have to be inside.

01:05:50.277 --> 01:05:52.069
I got a fiance to vaporize.

01:05:52.152 --> 01:05:53.858
- Watch your back, sis.
- Okay.

01:05:56.788 --> 01:05:57.788
Randall!

01:06:05.206 --> 01:06:07.741
We got her. Move in.

01:06:11.710 --> 01:06:12.967
Okay.

01:06:28.225 --> 01:06:30.241
I did not mean to do that!

01:06:42.985 --> 01:06:44.944
Something bothering you, agent?

01:06:45.389 --> 01:06:48.116
I just feel a little guilty
about what I did to Rachel, sir.

01:06:48.819 --> 01:06:51.069
Don't worry about it.
We'll send her a gift card.

01:06:51.152 --> 01:06:53.577
Now, I propose a toast.

01:06:56.563 --> 01:06:59.553
To a perfectly executed operation.

01:07:04.094 --> 01:07:05.761
Sir, we're under attack.

01:07:26.027 --> 01:07:29.842
Randall, wifey's home!

01:07:34.233 --> 01:07:36.217
Oh, my god. Rachel.

01:08:00.535 --> 01:08:03.368
What a woman.

01:08:05.480 --> 01:08:07.100
You no-good,

01:08:07.852 --> 01:08:11.154
lowdown, dirty, lying...

01:08:11.155 --> 01:08:12.328
Rachel, just listen to me.

01:08:12.329 --> 01:08:17.014
What kind of twisted sicko
tricks someone into a fake wedding?

01:08:19.027 --> 01:08:21.591
Party's over, bridezilla.
Stop right there.

01:08:22.818 --> 01:08:24.951
You son of a...

01:08:24.952 --> 01:08:26.546
- Have it your way.
- No!

01:08:27.077 --> 01:08:28.702
No!

01:08:33.750 --> 01:08:36.084
Very disappointing, agent handel.

01:08:38.859 --> 01:08:42.277
- Is that supposed to be a weapon?
- I don't know, but we gonna find out.

01:08:42.367 --> 01:08:44.783
Haven't you caused enough trouble
for one day?

01:08:44.792 --> 01:08:47.319
I haven't even begun causing trouble.

01:08:47.819 --> 01:08:51.216
Hell hath no fury like a bride scorned.

01:08:57.777 --> 01:09:00.499
Looks like it's real, huh?

01:09:04.319 --> 01:09:05.694
No. Right.

01:09:07.602 --> 01:09:10.335
Be honest.
How bad is it?

01:09:10.667 --> 01:09:13.796
Not bad at all.
You got tased. You'll be fine.

01:09:17.938 --> 01:09:21.354
- I'm so cold.
- You landed on our ice sculpture.

01:09:21.687 --> 01:09:22.952
Get up.

01:09:28.698 --> 01:09:29.846
Just...

01:09:30.268 --> 01:09:33.514
Just tell me the truth, for once.

01:09:34.334 --> 01:09:39.015
Is there anything about you
or about us that was real?

01:09:39.278 --> 01:09:42.867
Rachel, look at me.

01:09:43.859 --> 01:09:48.134
Before I met you, I didn't think
that I was even capable of real happiness.

01:09:49.183 --> 01:09:51.819
But that all changed
when you walked into my life.

01:09:52.653 --> 01:09:55.765
And I ended up breaking the first rule
of undercover work.

01:09:56.111 --> 01:09:57.486
Which is?

01:09:58.236 --> 01:09:59.711
Never fall in love.

01:10:12.778 --> 01:10:15.445
- Maddie!
- We're busting out of here.

01:10:15.517 --> 01:10:16.725
How'd you get past the guards?

01:10:16.727 --> 01:10:18.866
Because that little fox
is into some crazy stuff.

01:10:18.867 --> 01:10:20.039
Come on.

01:10:21.423 --> 01:10:23.195
- Let's go.
- You're amazing.

01:10:33.736 --> 01:10:36.975
The owls were fools to think
they could hide this.

01:11:14.861 --> 01:11:16.028
What's happening?

01:11:17.566 --> 01:11:19.233
Wait for it.

01:11:30.861 --> 01:11:33.291
Yes. Eureka!

01:11:34.327 --> 01:11:36.142
I've found it!

01:11:55.481 --> 01:11:56.809
Sonic.

01:11:58.611 --> 01:12:00.653
- What is that?
- A big problem.

01:12:01.403 --> 01:12:03.320
The compass led robotnik to the emerald.

01:12:03.322 --> 01:12:05.575
That's got to be hundreds of miles away.

01:12:06.861 --> 01:12:10.278
All right. Huddle up.
Let's figure out a plan.

01:12:10.551 --> 01:12:12.566
- Together.
- There's no time for that.

01:12:12.567 --> 01:12:14.590
I'm the only one
that can get there fast enough.

01:12:14.591 --> 01:12:17.661
Sonic, this is way too big for you
to do by yourself.

01:12:18.048 --> 01:12:20.020
You see that little fox over there?

01:12:20.085 --> 01:12:23.085
He came all the way across the universe
to meet his hero.

01:12:23.153 --> 01:12:26.567
And what did his hero do?
I practically got him killed.

01:12:26.945 --> 01:12:29.005
You know what?
You were right.

01:12:29.445 --> 01:12:33.347
My moment came and I blew it.
I'm no hero.

01:12:33.348 --> 01:12:34.348
- Wait.
- No.

01:12:34.403 --> 01:12:36.736
I'm not letting anyone else get hurt
because of me.

01:12:36.828 --> 01:12:38.854
I'm gonna fix this while I still can.

01:12:40.276 --> 01:12:41.901
Sonic!

01:12:41.988 --> 01:12:43.755
Sonic, wait!

01:12:46.090 --> 01:12:47.981
Hold on. Hold on.
Wait, wait, wait.

01:12:48.111 --> 01:12:50.785
- Don't move. Don't move.
- Take it easy, little guy. You're hurt.

01:12:50.786 --> 01:12:54.536
But we have to help him.
You don't know what he's up against.

01:13:01.632 --> 01:13:03.007
You believe us now?

01:13:10.070 --> 01:13:11.153
Hey, Bob!

01:13:11.155 --> 01:13:13.208
Hey, Maria, how you doing?

01:13:16.652 --> 01:13:17.675
Working on my moves.

01:13:17.676 --> 01:13:20.320
Just keepin' it green.
No need to burn the fuel.

01:13:20.322 --> 01:13:21.723
Speaking of fuel...

01:13:27.850 --> 01:13:29.225
Closed?

01:13:30.786 --> 01:13:32.150
That doesn't seem right.

01:13:45.114 --> 01:13:46.130
Close.

01:13:50.368 --> 01:13:51.660
Yes.

01:13:51.817 --> 01:13:54.442
Makeover, makeover.
Look at you.

01:13:54.465 --> 01:13:55.902
Freeze! Police!

01:13:57.200 --> 01:13:59.652
Oh, my god, you got robot hands.
You got robot hands.

01:13:59.653 --> 01:14:02.997
- No, they're gloves.
- Get 'em up. Now spread your fingers!

01:14:04.141 --> 01:14:07.153
Now wiggle 'em!
Wiggle your digits!

01:14:08.070 --> 01:14:11.434
Yes! Like you just finished
a big musical number.

01:14:12.570 --> 01:14:13.809
Good.

01:14:14.195 --> 01:14:15.739
Why is there a light on your head?

01:14:19.544 --> 01:14:21.895
'Cause I'm the sheriff
for the weekend, pal.

01:14:30.695 --> 01:14:31.957
Water.

01:14:31.958 --> 01:14:34.036
Why did it have to be water?

01:14:36.996 --> 01:14:39.371
Okay, you can do this.

01:14:42.972 --> 01:14:44.555
Gotta go fast.

01:16:27.547 --> 01:16:30.883
I don't want to die like this!
It's derivative!

01:16:32.312 --> 01:16:34.211
Make room for daddy!

01:16:41.679 --> 01:16:42.741
Two and two.

01:16:42.834 --> 01:16:46.593
Great!
We're still bipedals, more or less.

01:16:49.883 --> 01:16:51.140
Fire in the hole!

01:16:53.223 --> 01:16:56.687
I've solved it. There is a booby trap
every seven seco...

01:17:03.153 --> 01:17:04.648
That was a little early.

01:17:06.059 --> 01:17:09.960
So glad it didn't cut off my mustache.

01:17:09.961 --> 01:17:12.484
Hey, little red wrecking ball.

01:17:12.945 --> 01:17:15.278
I know you're dying
to get your emerald on,

01:17:15.280 --> 01:17:19.258
but can we be a little bit more mindful
of our surroundings?

01:17:19.570 --> 01:17:20.828
May I?

01:17:27.266 --> 01:17:29.849
In 30 feet, turn left.

01:17:29.874 --> 01:17:32.211
Work smarter, not harder.

01:17:53.236 --> 01:17:54.994
My pelvis.

01:17:59.009 --> 01:18:03.509
Okay, secret temple,
let's see what you've got.

01:18:11.460 --> 01:18:13.203
No, no, no! No!

01:18:17.733 --> 01:18:19.133
No.

01:18:19.820 --> 01:18:20.820
Yes!

01:18:26.778 --> 01:18:28.695
You have arrived at your destination.

01:18:28.785 --> 01:18:31.785
Wow. That really
opened up the space.

01:18:31.868 --> 01:18:34.827
I can't even picture it
with an impenetrable wall now.

01:18:34.903 --> 01:18:37.020
And the rubble is always a nice touch.

01:18:46.091 --> 01:18:49.762
At last.
The master emerald.

01:18:49.861 --> 01:18:51.111
Ultimate power.

01:18:51.113 --> 01:18:53.946
Soon order will be restored.

01:18:54.071 --> 01:18:57.122
All because of what we have done together.

01:18:57.449 --> 01:19:00.083
Such a lovely sentiment, knuckles.

01:19:00.304 --> 01:19:03.091
I think I feel a single tear forming.

01:19:05.782 --> 01:19:06.919
Sadly...

01:19:07.958 --> 01:19:12.716
You're as useful to me now
as a backstage pass to limp bizkit.

01:19:27.486 --> 01:19:28.653
Nailed it.

01:19:30.174 --> 01:19:33.666
This guy is always trying to spoil
a bad thing!

01:19:34.653 --> 01:19:37.399
You guys are here, too?
Took the long way, huh?

01:19:37.400 --> 01:19:39.403
Is everything a joke to you?

01:19:39.420 --> 01:19:42.713
Why must you constantly interfere
with my destiny?

01:19:42.719 --> 01:19:46.482
Because my destiny is to protect
my friends and family.

01:19:46.614 --> 01:19:49.009
I think I just threw up in my mouth.

01:19:49.173 --> 01:19:54.838
And if you want that emerald,
you're gonna have to go through me.

01:20:16.852 --> 01:20:19.894
The echidna's taking no prisoners today!

01:20:20.134 --> 01:20:24.095
Sonic has heart,
but will he lose the quill to live?

01:20:25.509 --> 01:20:29.470
I don't want to fight you,
but you're not giving me much choice.

01:20:35.820 --> 01:20:38.875
Too easy.
Let's do this.

01:21:05.533 --> 01:21:10.267
Why don't you stand still
and die with honor?

01:21:10.275 --> 01:21:11.494
Let me think about it.

01:21:11.673 --> 01:21:15.408
Okay, I thought about it and I pass.

01:21:24.773 --> 01:21:26.351
Hi there, beautiful.

01:21:27.538 --> 01:21:29.750
You're the real deal, aren't you?

01:21:30.153 --> 01:21:33.789
Where have you been all my life?

01:21:37.609 --> 01:21:40.156
Say goodbye, hedgehog.

01:21:43.403 --> 01:21:46.278
Knuckles, stop.
Robotnik's stealing the emerald!

01:21:46.361 --> 01:21:48.967
What kind of fool do you take me for?

01:21:48.968 --> 01:21:50.153
Just look.

01:21:52.703 --> 01:21:54.036
Mine.

01:21:55.278 --> 01:21:58.280
Wait!
That wasn't the deal.

01:22:01.445 --> 01:22:04.071
You poor, naive creature.

01:22:04.154 --> 01:22:05.571
It's not your fault.

01:22:05.669 --> 01:22:09.294
A more advanced intellect would have seen
this move coming a mile away.

01:22:09.362 --> 01:22:11.423
Or 1.6 kilometers.

01:22:11.430 --> 01:22:14.704
But I trusted you!
You were my friend!

01:22:21.525 --> 01:22:24.518
I'm sorry.
That just hit me funny.

01:22:24.890 --> 01:22:30.315
Let this be my final lesson to you,
you dim-witted celestial skin tag.

01:22:30.946 --> 01:22:32.321
Friends...

01:22:32.404 --> 01:22:36.404
Are open, honest
and vulnerable with each other.

01:22:36.487 --> 01:22:39.244
Which means x squared
times the hypotenuse of y squared,

01:22:39.245 --> 01:22:42.385
divided by the absolute value
of friendship, equals...

01:22:42.446 --> 01:22:43.487
Dookie!

01:22:43.760 --> 01:22:44.953
Oh, no.

01:22:52.977 --> 01:22:58.368
Chaos is power!

01:23:16.904 --> 01:23:18.529
Let's get out of here!

01:23:30.571 --> 01:23:32.111
Knuckles!

01:23:36.242 --> 01:23:39.399
Water again?
Come on!

01:24:37.648 --> 01:24:42.141
- You saved me.
- Don't talk to me. I'm not in the mood.

01:24:43.237 --> 01:24:47.954
How dare you attack me
in my hour of sorrow!

01:24:48.182 --> 01:24:50.009
Why did you save me?

01:24:51.391 --> 01:24:53.540
Because you saved me first,

01:24:53.542 --> 01:24:57.209
which clearly gave you
a tactical advantage I do not understand.

01:24:57.279 --> 01:25:01.337
It wasn't a tactic.
I couldn't just let you die.

01:25:01.946 --> 01:25:06.696
Why? I've been trying to destroy you
since the moment we met.

01:25:06.884 --> 01:25:10.696
Because being a hero
isn't about taking care of yourself.

01:25:10.779 --> 01:25:14.196
It's about taking responsibility
for other people.

01:25:16.487 --> 01:25:19.737
Wise words.
An ancient earth proverb?

01:25:19.821 --> 01:25:22.237
No, sir,
that's a wachowski family special.

01:25:22.321 --> 01:25:24.321
I got it from a guy in a rowboat.

01:25:25.032 --> 01:25:26.844
Someone who means a lot to me.

01:25:28.487 --> 01:25:30.196
Wait a second.
What's that sound?

01:25:32.242 --> 01:25:36.374
Only Sonic the hedgehog
needs rescuing this much.

01:25:36.880 --> 01:25:39.055
That sly little fox!

01:25:41.438 --> 01:25:44.274
Come on, knucklehead.
We're not beat yet.

01:25:44.487 --> 01:25:47.454
On the mountain,
you told me you'd lost everything.

01:25:47.661 --> 01:25:49.161
The way I did.

01:25:49.237 --> 01:25:51.987
But you seem so hopeful and free.

01:25:52.987 --> 01:25:57.173
How did you move forward
despite failing again?

01:25:57.321 --> 01:26:00.657
And again. And again.
And again. And again.

01:26:00.680 --> 01:26:04.429
Okay, I didn't fail that much.
But I didn't do this all alone.

01:26:04.430 --> 01:26:07.187
I found a new family.
New friends.

01:26:07.188 --> 01:26:08.594
And you can too.

01:26:10.954 --> 01:26:13.485
You don't have to be alone anymore.

01:26:18.112 --> 01:26:20.657
Are you kidding me with that handshake?

01:26:22.958 --> 01:26:24.375
I'm done playing games, pal.

01:26:26.049 --> 01:26:28.040
You're gonna tell me what I want to know.

01:26:30.273 --> 01:26:33.915
And I am asking you for the last time...

01:26:35.904 --> 01:26:38.362
What would you like on your bagel?

01:26:38.618 --> 01:26:40.362
I'm not telling you anything.

01:26:40.364 --> 01:26:43.280
And that is a display bagel.

01:26:43.446 --> 01:26:46.654
I don't get it with you!
I mean, I've tried everything.

01:26:46.737 --> 01:26:50.362
I was good cop. I was bad cop.
I was cop who offers you a bagel.

01:26:50.446 --> 01:26:51.554
And nothing. It's like...

01:26:51.555 --> 01:26:53.705
That is a display bagel.
Wow.

01:27:03.102 --> 01:27:04.921
Doctor, you're here.

01:27:06.779 --> 01:27:11.842
Yes, I'm here, and yet i'm...

01:27:13.029 --> 01:27:14.912
Not all there.

01:27:14.935 --> 01:27:16.302
Sir, are you feeling okay?

01:27:16.304 --> 01:27:20.429
I'm more than okay.

01:27:21.112 --> 01:27:24.237
I'm upgraded.

01:27:24.321 --> 01:27:27.362
Sinister 3.0.

01:27:27.446 --> 01:27:32.073
My game is next level.

01:27:36.794 --> 01:27:37.842
Hi.

01:27:40.614 --> 01:27:44.501
I can smell the electricity

01:27:44.502 --> 01:27:47.075
in your brain.

01:27:48.700 --> 01:27:51.248
You smell like a snack plate.

01:27:52.279 --> 01:27:55.404
Yeah, that's fair.
I had a couple today.

01:27:55.946 --> 01:27:57.568
Sit down.

01:28:02.071 --> 01:28:03.732
In the chair.

01:28:06.555 --> 01:28:08.052
I didn't know.

01:28:08.946 --> 01:28:11.403
'Cause he, 'cause he
was in the chair, so I didn't.

01:28:11.404 --> 01:28:12.045
Okay.

01:28:12.112 --> 01:28:14.435
Sir? We have a problem.

01:28:19.862 --> 01:28:22.874
- All teams in position!
- Set up a perimeter!

01:28:22.987 --> 01:28:24.800
Move! Move! Move!

01:28:39.914 --> 01:28:43.860
Incorrectus, my trusty barnacle.

01:28:44.654 --> 01:28:47.352
After all these years,

01:28:47.779 --> 01:28:49.487
what I finally got...

01:28:50.654 --> 01:28:52.860
Is a solution.

01:29:03.321 --> 01:29:05.196
- Commander.
- Status report.

01:29:05.279 --> 01:29:08.654
Robotnik is in there with stone
and a hostage. Possibly local pd.

01:29:08.737 --> 01:29:12.112
I'm not saying he's dumb,
but if he is local pd,

01:29:12.196 --> 01:29:13.860
this town's in a lot of trouble.

01:29:14.612 --> 01:29:15.904
- Wade.
- Wade.

01:29:30.310 --> 01:29:31.310
Okay.

01:29:32.244 --> 01:29:34.786
Rockin' that new spring collection, I see.

01:29:34.943 --> 01:29:39.357
Well, if it isn't the pastry king.

01:29:39.487 --> 01:29:40.826
The donut lord.

01:29:41.112 --> 01:29:43.372
A real genius would remember
the name of the guy

01:29:43.373 --> 01:29:45.176
who helped kick your butt off this planet.

01:29:45.177 --> 01:29:47.584
And I'll do it again if you mess
with green hills.

01:29:48.029 --> 01:29:52.162
Congratulations on your oh-so-temporary
sense of superiority.

01:29:52.187 --> 01:29:54.505
You're finished, robotnik!
We've taken everything.

01:29:54.506 --> 01:29:57.489
Your lab, your drones, your funding!

01:29:57.490 --> 01:30:01.318
Let's see how big of a man you are
without your silly little robots.

01:30:02.071 --> 01:30:04.092
Would you like to see...

01:30:05.438 --> 01:30:07.857
How big a man I can be?

01:30:18.446 --> 01:30:21.612
Welcome to the new norm.

01:30:31.904 --> 01:30:33.584
My god!

01:30:37.209 --> 01:30:40.888
Doctor! Take me with you!

01:31:05.274 --> 01:31:07.102
He's taking everything apart.

01:31:07.973 --> 01:31:09.626
He's building something.

01:31:17.180 --> 01:31:19.798
That can only be one thing.

01:31:19.805 --> 01:31:22.079
The fearsome power of the emerald.

01:31:22.162 --> 01:31:26.162
If that thing really turns thoughts
into power, we are in big trouble.

01:31:26.237 --> 01:31:28.477
Robotnik has a lot of bad thoughts.

01:31:28.479 --> 01:31:31.061
Hey, Sonic,
are you sure it was a good idea

01:31:31.062 --> 01:31:32.904
bringing you-know-who aboard?

01:31:33.003 --> 01:31:36.753
Knuckles isn't really a bad guy.
He's just a little mixed up.

01:31:36.828 --> 01:31:38.536
I am not mixed up!

01:31:38.954 --> 01:31:44.158
I have steely focus. And I'm complex.
And that's a lot for some people.

01:31:44.328 --> 01:31:47.579
Hope you're not still mad
I hit you with that car.

01:31:47.696 --> 01:31:49.446
I was completely uninjured.

01:31:49.529 --> 01:31:53.071
And my revenge will come
when you least expect it, fox.

01:32:24.154 --> 01:32:27.028
Sir, you're magnificent!

01:32:27.029 --> 01:32:29.255
Thank you, sycophant.

01:32:29.256 --> 01:32:31.664
Your admiration is inevitable.

01:32:41.474 --> 01:32:42.904
I knew it!

01:32:42.987 --> 01:32:45.756
Just like the stay puft marshmallow man.

01:32:46.591 --> 01:32:48.302
World domination playlist.

01:33:02.156 --> 01:33:03.322
Fall back.

01:33:04.529 --> 01:33:07.533
Fall back! Quick! Retreat!

01:33:09.362 --> 01:33:11.446
How are we supposed to beat this thing?

01:33:11.529 --> 01:33:12.571
We need a plan.

01:33:12.654 --> 01:33:14.916
Knuckles, use your strength to...

01:33:15.279 --> 01:33:17.612
Jump off the plane. Wow.

01:33:17.696 --> 01:33:21.612
Okay, this is what we're gonna do.
Step 1: Light taunting.

01:33:21.614 --> 01:33:23.466
Step 2: I have no idea.

01:33:26.737 --> 01:33:27.904
Sonic!

01:33:31.094 --> 01:33:32.904
Nice action figure, eggman.

01:33:32.906 --> 01:33:36.110
Does it do anything
or just stand there looking ugly?

01:33:39.453 --> 01:33:42.353
Like a blister, he keeps coming back!

01:33:43.205 --> 01:33:46.445
He's on the okay-to-kill list.
Shoot the missiles. Make a decision.

01:33:46.446 --> 01:33:49.368
I need a moment, sir.
I'm trying to figure out how to do this.

01:33:49.375 --> 01:33:51.079
Did you even glance at a manual?

01:33:51.375 --> 01:33:53.541
- No!
- I'll do it.

01:33:53.653 --> 01:33:55.204
Pardon my lightning.

01:33:55.211 --> 01:33:57.259
You might want to ground yourself.

01:34:00.384 --> 01:34:03.040
I'm gonna pop that thing open
like a can of chili...

01:34:05.279 --> 01:34:06.926
Hang on!

01:34:20.124 --> 01:34:22.134
- Yeah!
- Close one.

01:34:23.142 --> 01:34:24.626
Sonic!

01:34:28.211 --> 01:34:29.697
Robotnik!

01:34:31.463 --> 01:34:32.655
Deceiver!

01:34:32.738 --> 01:34:34.783
Die, mosquito.

01:34:47.162 --> 01:34:48.338
I felt that.

01:35:07.113 --> 01:35:08.572
What just happened?

01:35:08.581 --> 01:35:12.011
It's the stache masher.
Right here in the manual.

01:35:14.127 --> 01:35:16.538
Return to sender.

01:35:24.261 --> 01:35:25.595
Stone?

01:35:26.947 --> 01:35:31.363
Great. Next thing you know, there'll be
a report about a hostile work environment.

01:35:34.128 --> 01:35:37.418
Those were our best attacks,
and they did nothing!

01:35:37.513 --> 01:35:40.144
We can't beat robotnik as
long as he's got that emerald.

01:35:40.146 --> 01:35:41.363
He's too powerful.

01:35:41.405 --> 01:35:44.393
Look, we aren't strong enough
to beat robotnik on our own.

01:35:44.394 --> 01:35:45.822
But there's three of us.

01:35:45.896 --> 01:35:49.063
Your strength, your smarts and my speed.

01:35:49.155 --> 01:35:51.284
Together.
That's how we win.

01:35:51.285 --> 01:35:55.597
So we make our stand here
on the field of battle.

01:35:55.604 --> 01:35:56.836
As a team.

01:35:57.254 --> 01:35:58.707
This is it.

01:35:59.780 --> 01:36:02.722
This is our moment.

01:36:04.488 --> 01:36:06.410
Time to fight.

01:36:13.475 --> 01:36:17.183
Bad time to say this,
but I don't actually have a plan.

01:36:17.954 --> 01:36:19.787
Tails, any ideas?

01:36:19.863 --> 01:36:21.530
We have to find his weak spot.

01:36:21.613 --> 01:36:23.238
I suggest the groin.

01:36:23.240 --> 01:36:25.440
What? No. No!

01:36:25.442 --> 01:36:28.159
Traditionally, yes,
the groin is the weakest spot.

01:36:28.160 --> 01:36:30.323
Stop saying "groin."

01:36:30.324 --> 01:36:31.879
Hedgehog!

01:36:32.285 --> 01:36:33.449
Look out!

01:36:36.347 --> 01:36:38.761
I know what his weak spot is.
It's me.

01:36:38.863 --> 01:36:40.691
I'm the groin!

01:36:43.441 --> 01:36:46.315
Think about it.
I live rent-free in this dude's head.

01:36:46.316 --> 01:36:48.284
So if I go out there and rile him up...

01:36:48.285 --> 01:36:50.673
He'll focus on only you,
leaving himself open

01:36:50.674 --> 01:36:53.112
to a flanking maneuver
from me and the fox!

01:36:53.113 --> 01:36:55.948
Hedgehog,
you are a brave and noble warrior.

01:36:55.949 --> 01:36:58.640
Go to your certain death with honor.

01:36:58.642 --> 01:37:01.339
We're gonna have to work
on your pep talks, pal.

01:37:01.340 --> 01:37:03.301
- Yeah.
- Let's go.

01:37:06.910 --> 01:37:08.357
All right, mustache.

01:37:08.597 --> 01:37:11.197
You want me?
Come and get me.

01:37:11.886 --> 01:37:14.155
You don't tell me
about coming and getting.

01:37:14.238 --> 01:37:16.615
I am on the cutting edge
of coming and getting!

01:37:16.616 --> 01:37:18.480
Coming, getting.

01:37:18.482 --> 01:37:23.222
Coming, getting.
Coming, getting. Coming, getting.

01:37:25.847 --> 01:37:27.636
You're really heavy.

01:37:27.652 --> 01:37:30.652
That's because I am one
million percent muscle.

01:37:30.659 --> 01:37:32.120
Faster, fox!

01:37:33.663 --> 01:37:37.053
- Go! Move, guys! Move back!
- Let's go, that's it! Go, go, go!

01:37:37.054 --> 01:37:38.115
- Keep going!
- Go! Go!

01:37:38.116 --> 01:37:40.037
- No, no! Stop!
- Stop the truck!

01:37:40.038 --> 01:37:41.780
Tom, what happened here?

01:37:42.444 --> 01:37:44.834
- You thinking what I'm thinking?
- Let's get our kid.

01:37:44.835 --> 01:37:46.515
- We need your truck!
- We need your truck!

01:37:52.056 --> 01:37:54.577
Coming, getting.

01:37:57.285 --> 01:37:59.390
So what's the plan here?

01:37:59.920 --> 01:38:04.120
You gonna build a big robot house?
Get yourself a big robot wife?

01:38:04.197 --> 01:38:08.772
I'm going to enslave humanity
and force them to service my machines.

01:38:09.022 --> 01:38:11.454
First, green hills.
Then the universe.

01:38:11.456 --> 01:38:12.757
Then the multiverse.

01:38:12.863 --> 01:38:15.944
Then who knows?
Maybe that'll be enough.

01:38:16.238 --> 01:38:17.812
Full disclosure?

01:38:18.454 --> 01:38:21.233
You won't be there.

01:38:26.069 --> 01:38:28.069
Eye lasers?
Really?

01:38:40.218 --> 01:38:42.358
Snot rocket!

01:38:43.697 --> 01:38:44.890
No, no, no!
No, no, no!

01:38:53.238 --> 01:38:54.738
Giving up already?

01:38:55.077 --> 01:38:59.054
Not so tough when you're fighting someone
700 times your size, are ya?

01:39:00.696 --> 01:39:03.154
You can't beat me!

01:39:03.444 --> 01:39:06.952
I'm all-powerful!
All-knowing!

01:39:09.155 --> 01:39:11.530
All-seeing.

01:39:12.288 --> 01:39:14.900
Looks like your fancy robot has a glitch.

01:39:14.901 --> 01:39:16.694
Is it me? What about me?
I'm over here.

01:39:16.695 --> 01:39:18.405
Up top! Down below!
Behind you!

01:39:19.146 --> 01:39:21.232
I'm over here.
Sorry! Over here.

01:39:21.754 --> 01:39:22.962
Too slow!

01:39:22.988 --> 01:39:25.030
- You can't outsmart me.
- Missed me again.

01:39:25.032 --> 01:39:27.122
I'm the outsmarter-er!

01:39:31.319 --> 01:39:34.278
I didn't outsmart you.
I'm just the distraction.

01:39:34.280 --> 01:39:35.572
Robotnik!

01:39:36.119 --> 01:39:39.082
I am also a hologram.

01:39:39.083 --> 01:39:40.988
Disloyal.

01:39:41.072 --> 01:39:43.989
"Dis" is how I roll.

01:40:12.452 --> 01:40:14.014
Where's my emerald?

01:40:14.653 --> 01:40:16.943
No, no, no, no!
No, no, no!

01:40:16.944 --> 01:40:19.225
Computer, auxiliary power.

01:40:28.238 --> 01:40:30.843
The emerald.
It's right there.

01:40:31.335 --> 01:40:33.428
Move, you hunk of junk!

01:40:37.904 --> 01:40:40.964
I have to reach it.

01:41:04.285 --> 01:41:05.715
Come on, come on, come on.

01:41:07.584 --> 01:41:09.910
There he is! Go! Go, go, go!

01:41:18.738 --> 01:41:19.815
No!

01:41:19.816 --> 01:41:21.074
We got you, Sonic.

01:41:22.347 --> 01:41:23.621
Hold on!

01:41:36.737 --> 01:41:39.160
- You guys okay?
- Yeah.

01:41:40.534 --> 01:41:41.534
Okay.

01:41:46.988 --> 01:41:49.253
I got the emerald.
We could still defeat him.

01:41:49.254 --> 01:41:52.543
Come on, come on.
How does this thing work? What do I do?

01:41:53.699 --> 01:41:54.763
What?

01:41:55.322 --> 01:41:58.418
No. No, no, no, no!
No, no, no, no!

01:42:02.021 --> 01:42:06.441
Look at the happy little family.

01:42:11.775 --> 01:42:14.496
You have to get away from me.
I'm the one he wants.

01:42:14.497 --> 01:42:15.530
Hey.

01:42:16.116 --> 01:42:17.877
We're not going anywhere.

01:42:18.253 --> 01:42:19.517
We're family.

01:42:23.105 --> 01:42:25.158
And families stick together...

01:42:27.627 --> 01:42:29.080
No matter what.

01:42:31.905 --> 01:42:33.361
I love you guys.

01:42:33.947 --> 01:42:35.822
We love you too, Sonic.

01:42:43.988 --> 01:42:46.004
No!

01:42:47.629 --> 01:42:50.058
I got him!

01:42:50.100 --> 01:42:53.824
I finally got him!

01:42:58.780 --> 01:43:00.754
What was that?

01:43:46.365 --> 01:43:48.671
It's over, eggman.

01:43:49.988 --> 01:43:52.738
I like the new look.
It works for you.

01:43:53.403 --> 01:43:56.403
What do you say
we just let bygones be bygones?

01:43:56.405 --> 01:44:00.397
I did some things, you did some things.
There are good people on both sides.

01:44:02.108 --> 01:44:05.663
Surely two intelligent beings

01:44:06.697 --> 01:44:09.139
can work these things out!

01:44:20.877 --> 01:44:23.155
- Come on, buddy. Come on.
- Get him, Sonic!

01:44:23.238 --> 01:44:24.853
Yeah. Come on.

01:44:41.779 --> 01:44:43.264
It's like that?

01:44:44.284 --> 01:44:46.850
Okay, we're not friends.

01:44:50.822 --> 01:44:53.600
Later, hater!

01:45:04.488 --> 01:45:06.254
- Sonic!
- Buddy!

01:45:06.530 --> 01:45:08.572
Wait! You cannot touch him!

01:45:08.910 --> 01:45:11.644
The hedgehog holds
the power of the emerald.

01:45:12.038 --> 01:45:16.019
I am sorry.
He is no longer the Sonic you once knew.

01:45:16.167 --> 01:45:17.167
What?

01:45:37.178 --> 01:45:39.139
You got to try this.

01:45:44.530 --> 01:45:47.863
Okay.
He is exactly the Sonic you once knew.

01:45:49.738 --> 01:45:51.381
- Uh-huh.
- Uh-huh.

01:45:59.667 --> 01:46:00.890
Sonic!

01:46:03.123 --> 01:46:05.074
Bring it in, bud.

01:46:06.363 --> 01:46:07.988
It's good to be back in blue.

01:46:08.072 --> 01:46:11.405
The golden god thing was fun,
but blue has always been more my color.

01:46:11.488 --> 01:46:12.572
Looks good on you.

01:46:12.655 --> 01:46:18.370
Sonic, you were the most powerful hero
in the universe, and you let it go.

01:46:18.371 --> 01:46:19.543
Why?

01:46:21.026 --> 01:46:24.151
Because I still have
some growing up to do.

01:46:26.363 --> 01:46:30.472
- And I kind of like being a kid.
- And you're not just any kid.

01:46:30.778 --> 01:46:32.316
You're our kid.

01:46:32.662 --> 01:46:33.926
That's right.

01:46:34.155 --> 01:46:36.800
- Bring it in!
- Yay. Hugs.

01:46:36.801 --> 01:46:39.840
It's a good thing we didn't do this before.
You would've blown up.

01:46:47.525 --> 01:46:49.038
You fixed it.

01:46:49.120 --> 01:46:52.454
I've spent my whole life
questing for this.

01:46:52.530 --> 01:46:54.063
Now I have it.

01:46:54.064 --> 01:46:55.698
Now we have it.

01:46:55.781 --> 01:46:58.364
What do we do with it?
What next?

01:46:58.448 --> 01:47:00.767
There were once two orders of heroes

01:47:00.768 --> 01:47:05.095
who protected the galaxy from those
who would use the emerald for evil.

01:47:05.096 --> 01:47:09.253
But they have all passed on
to the great battleground in the sky.

01:47:09.255 --> 01:47:12.283
So we start a new order.
The three of us.

01:47:12.364 --> 01:47:14.073
This is no light task.

01:47:14.156 --> 01:47:19.182
We must make a vow to use our powers
to keep the universe safe,

01:47:19.656 --> 01:47:21.489
to watch out for each other.

01:47:21.783 --> 01:47:23.288
Our new tribe.

01:47:23.675 --> 01:47:24.489
I know!

01:47:24.573 --> 01:47:27.276
- A power bump!
- Good idea.

01:47:28.039 --> 01:47:31.581
It's an earth custom.
An unbreakable promise.

01:47:31.823 --> 01:47:33.114
Very well.

01:47:33.906 --> 01:47:36.236
A power bump it is.

01:47:37.496 --> 01:47:39.163
Power bump!

01:47:43.073 --> 01:47:47.198
It's truly a beautiful day for baseball
here in green hills.

01:47:47.281 --> 01:47:48.989
An exciting lineup today

01:47:48.991 --> 01:47:52.588
with the debut appearance
of two new players!

01:47:52.589 --> 01:47:56.621
On the mound,
rookie sensation from across the galaxy,

01:47:56.705 --> 01:47:59.486
miles "tails" prower,

01:47:59.487 --> 01:48:04.487
facing off against the powerhouse,
knuckles the echidna.

01:48:05.538 --> 01:48:07.413
I don't understand.

01:48:07.496 --> 01:48:09.663
Why am I angry at the enemy ball?

01:48:09.820 --> 01:48:10.987
You're not angry.

01:48:10.996 --> 01:48:14.635
You just want to hit it as hard as you can
and then run around the bases.

01:48:14.636 --> 01:48:19.307
But if my quest ends where I am standing,
why run at all?

01:48:19.650 --> 01:48:22.197
I can't with this guy.
Why do I even try?

01:48:22.198 --> 01:48:25.064
This is just a game.
We're out here having fun.

01:48:25.065 --> 01:48:26.489
Just having some fun.

01:48:26.768 --> 01:48:27.989
Fun.

01:48:29.279 --> 01:48:31.822
All right!
Give him the heat, tails!

01:48:31.823 --> 01:48:33.706
Hope you're ready for my fastball.

01:48:33.713 --> 01:48:36.128
Your fastball will be dishonored.

01:48:36.285 --> 01:48:38.275
And so will you, fox.

01:48:38.276 --> 01:48:41.072
- Easy, guys!
- Don't think about it too much.

01:48:41.073 --> 01:48:44.619
Just keep your elbow up,
eye on the ball and give it a ride.

01:48:44.620 --> 01:48:46.347
A ride? To where?

01:48:50.156 --> 01:48:51.753
Power bump!

01:48:56.796 --> 01:48:58.254
Victory is mine!

01:48:58.256 --> 01:49:00.736
Hey, no fair!
That shouldn't count.

01:49:00.737 --> 01:49:03.198
First base is also mine!

01:49:03.534 --> 01:49:07.864
- I think that was our only ball.
- I have conquered the second of the bases!

01:49:07.948 --> 01:49:09.619
Who wants ice cream?

01:49:09.620 --> 01:49:10.781
Knocked the cover off that.

01:49:10.783 --> 01:49:12.878
- Ice cream!
- Ice cream, yeah!

01:49:14.113 --> 01:49:17.571
I am having the fun!
What is ice cream?

01:49:17.909 --> 01:49:20.906
It's a dessert.
If you like fun, you're gonna love it.

01:49:21.315 --> 01:49:24.408
Yum. Dessert.
Does it have grapes in it?

01:49:24.409 --> 01:49:26.338
No, not usually.

01:49:26.339 --> 01:49:27.847
I'm proud of our little guy.

01:49:28.489 --> 01:49:31.831
I really like his new friends,
especially the red one.

01:49:32.031 --> 01:49:34.656
- He cracks me up.
- Heck of a swing too.

01:49:34.746 --> 01:49:37.496
Come on, fox.
Our dessert adventure awaits.

01:49:37.498 --> 01:49:38.956
- Good job, guys.
- Yeah.

01:49:38.996 --> 01:49:42.472
You too, baby. Let's go get some ice cream.
Come on, come on.

01:49:43.530 --> 01:49:45.696
I'm happy for you, pal.

01:49:45.698 --> 01:49:48.864
Got your wingmen.
Perfect friends to grow up with.

01:49:48.948 --> 01:49:52.331
- Come on, knuckles.
- My victory chariot!

01:49:54.338 --> 01:49:57.175
I've got a lot more than that...
Dad.

01:50:02.752 --> 01:50:04.085
Race you to the truck.

01:50:05.739 --> 01:50:07.156
One, two, three, go!

01:50:07.739 --> 01:50:09.864
No, don't go easy on me.
I want your best.

01:50:09.956 --> 01:50:12.914
Sonic, I have just been told
they have sprinkles.

01:50:12.989 --> 01:50:16.656
Ice cream and sprinkles?
This is your new destiny.

01:50:17.190 --> 01:50:21.768
What a perfect meal to celebrate
my victory over you in base of ball.

01:50:21.770 --> 01:50:24.839
- What?
- I mean, you barely beat me.

01:50:25.039 --> 01:50:27.539
You've never been beaten so hard.

01:50:32.010 --> 01:50:33.456
Can't forget this.

01:52:32.571 --> 01:52:34.446
Agent, I want an update.

01:52:34.652 --> 01:52:37.340
Still searching, sir.
We haven't found any sign of robotnik.

01:52:37.442 --> 01:52:39.781
No one could've survived that crash.

01:52:39.864 --> 01:52:42.841
He's toast.
Good riddance.

01:52:43.031 --> 01:52:45.781
What a mess that lunatic made.

01:52:46.535 --> 01:52:49.684
Sir, there's something else.

01:52:49.788 --> 01:52:53.330
When we were wiping robotnik
off our database, we found something.

01:52:53.406 --> 01:52:57.605
A file buried deep in our system
and dating back over 50 years.

01:52:57.606 --> 01:53:00.164
- What was it?
- Coordinates, sir.

01:53:00.281 --> 01:53:02.231
Coordinates? To what?

01:53:02.864 --> 01:53:04.823
A secret research facility.

01:53:05.471 --> 01:53:07.054
It was a black site, sir.

01:53:07.781 --> 01:53:10.552
Someone worked very hard
to keep this hidden.

01:53:11.614 --> 01:53:12.823
My god.

01:53:13.781 --> 01:53:15.317
Project shadow.
