WEBVTT

00:01.710 --> 00:05.171
...working on King here, top of the key,

00:05.297 --> 00:08.174
dribbling around him,
coming around the corner there. He's up!

00:08.759 --> 00:10.760
Two points! Beautiful play.

00:10.886 --> 00:12.512
Now, that's a great play.

00:12.638 --> 00:16.891
If you testify, no one can protect you,
especially the Feds.

00:17.017 --> 00:18.434
We'll keep you safe, Joey.

00:18.560 --> 00:19.686
Right.
In Witness Protection.

00:19.812 --> 00:21.562
This great new life
he's giving you?

00:21.772 --> 00:24.524
You're sacking groceries at some
goat-town Stop and Shop,

00:24.650 --> 00:27.360
when one of Vitale's guys comes
and puts two in the back of your skull.

00:27.486 --> 00:29.696
Counselor, are you advising a witness

00:29.822 --> 00:31.614
to withhold evidence
from a federal grand jury?

00:31.740 --> 00:33.533
He came forward.
He volunteered.

00:33.659 --> 00:37.370
I'm advising him not to testify
until I'm satisfied you can protect him.

00:37.496 --> 00:40.123
You guys mind?
I got money on this.

00:40.249 --> 00:42.667
What do you want?
We gave you everything you asked for.

00:43.001 --> 00:44.001
I asked for pasta.

00:44.128 --> 00:46.003
You got steak. Enjoy it.

00:48.924 --> 00:50.842
- What are you doing?
- What?

00:53.011 --> 00:54.470
Where's your quit candy?
I just gave you a pack.

00:54.596 --> 00:56.556
Yeah, sorry. I forgot.

00:58.475 --> 01:01.060
Joey, whatever they give us,
what they tell you,

01:01.186 --> 01:03.354
you get popped,
what am I gonna do, sue them?

01:04.481 --> 01:07.567
That's not what this is about.

01:07.693 --> 01:09.694
You're gonna miss me.

01:09.820 --> 01:10.820
I'm your lawyer, Joey.

01:10.988 --> 01:12.071
You're my brother.

01:13.240 --> 01:17.118
And I do this, you know,
I go into Witness Protection,

01:17.244 --> 01:18.870
we're never gonna see
each other again.

01:20.456 --> 01:22.081
That doesn't bother you?

01:22.207 --> 01:23.291
It kills me.

01:27.296 --> 01:31.048
There he goes.
Nice pick. He did a good job.

01:31.216 --> 01:32.467
And Michael David...

01:33.886 --> 01:35.136
I gotta take a leak.

01:39.016 --> 01:40.641
You all right?

01:43.270 --> 01:47.273
Yeah, yeah.
Just a little dizzy.

01:47.399 --> 01:48.232
Get some air.

01:48.358 --> 01:49.192
Hot.

01:52.279 --> 01:53.988
- Joey.
- What'd you say to him?

01:54.114 --> 01:54.947
Something's wrong.

01:55.073 --> 01:56.032
Yeah, nice try.

01:56.158 --> 01:57.825
Come on! Let go of me!

01:58.035 --> 01:59.911
Let go of me!
Can't you see he's sick?

02:00.037 --> 02:01.579
- Joey! Joey!
- Let me go!

02:01.705 --> 02:03.080
Something's wrong with him!

02:03.290 --> 02:05.208
Come on, you're not
getting out of this that easy.

02:05.334 --> 02:07.502
Either you're dead
or you're testifying.

02:43.622 --> 02:44.455
Don't have it.

02:44.873 --> 02:46.165
- Budget?
- Nope.

02:47.000 --> 02:49.961
Revenue statement.
List of expenses.

02:50.087 --> 02:51.629
House has been very busy.

02:52.089 --> 02:54.090
Saving New Jersey
from leprosy. Yes, I know.

02:54.216 --> 02:57.343
Getting me his numbers,
that's your job.

02:58.095 --> 02:59.178
We're in a meeting.

02:59.304 --> 03:00.555
I need the lawyer.

03:00.681 --> 03:01.931
Who'd you kill?

03:02.057 --> 03:03.850
Nobody.
But it's not even lunch.

03:03.976 --> 03:07.019
I got served with a federal court order.
Some witness went into a coma.

03:07.145 --> 03:09.063
They want me
to take a look at him.

03:09.231 --> 03:10.314
What?

03:11.650 --> 03:14.610
They want you to examine
a sick person?

03:14.903 --> 03:17.154
This is a public relations nightmare.

03:17.281 --> 03:19.991
Folk think our staff do
that kind of thing around here,

03:20.117 --> 03:21.617
this place will be crawling
with sick people.

03:22.160 --> 03:24.996
I'm a doctor. I'm not a lapdog
for the Feds. I don't play fetch.

03:25.247 --> 03:29.166
Nobody tells you what to do.
Am I right, Dr. Cuddy?

03:29.293 --> 03:30.334
You have three choices.

03:30.586 --> 03:31.836
Hire a lawyer to fight the order,

03:31.962 --> 03:36.007
treat the guy or go to jail
for contempt. Up to you.

03:36.133 --> 03:40.469
Jail. You'd like that.
No more naughty schoolgirl.

03:40.596 --> 03:43.514
Conjugal visit,
that's her new fantasy.

03:50.147 --> 03:51.689
We're not leaving
until he's gone,

03:51.815 --> 03:54.567
or you show me one good reason
for keeping him.

04:19.593 --> 04:22.595
He's really out of it, huh?

04:23.096 --> 04:25.014
Causes of coma,
metabolic, structural...

04:25.140 --> 04:26.807
He had his stomach pumped.

04:26.934 --> 04:27.934
Why would they do that?

04:28.060 --> 04:29.018
Rule out poisoning.

04:29.144 --> 04:30.770
Not the typical first guess.

04:30.896 --> 04:32.772
Nope, first guess was faking it.

04:32.898 --> 04:36.025
Patient's a federal witness,
reluctant, I'm assuming.

04:36.151 --> 04:38.069
He's also an eight
on the Glasgow Coma Scale.

04:39.237 --> 04:40.655
He's barely alive.
Pretty tough to fake.

04:40.906 --> 04:43.658
Any recent history of head trauma?
Bad car accident? Fall?

04:43.784 --> 04:45.952
They tell me no,
but do an MRI to be sure.

04:46.078 --> 04:48.120
Metabolic causes,
liver, kidney, diabetes...

04:48.246 --> 04:50.748
Check for everything.
Feds are paying.

04:50.874 --> 04:52.875
We're gonna turn a profit
on this one, boys.

04:53.001 --> 04:57.755
Dr. House, Bill Arnello. I'm a lawyer.
I represent Mr. Smith.

04:57.881 --> 04:59.131
What's wrong with him?

05:00.133 --> 05:01.759
Do I come to you
with my problems?

05:01.885 --> 05:04.095
He's also my brother.

05:04.221 --> 05:07.098
What? You changed your name?

05:07.224 --> 05:08.766
Smith wasn't good
enough for you?

05:08.892 --> 05:11.018
His name's Joey.
He's my only brother.

05:11.144 --> 05:12.645
He's important to you.
Got it.

05:12.771 --> 05:16.148
So, no placebos for him.
We'll use the real medicine.

05:16.274 --> 05:19.193
Well, this was fun.
Let's do it again soon.

05:23.448 --> 05:25.282
Brother in the Mafia?

05:28.120 --> 05:31.080
So, just Joey?

05:31.206 --> 05:32.999
I was hoping
for a nickname.

05:33.125 --> 05:36.502
Joey Mango. Joey the Wrench.

05:42.134 --> 05:43.384
People know where I am.

05:43.510 --> 05:45.261
I want you to do your job.

05:45.387 --> 05:47.972
Diagnose him, fix him
and keep him here.

05:49.599 --> 05:51.267
We're a bit of
a specialized hospital.

05:51.393 --> 05:54.770
We generally only deal with patients
while they're actually sick.

05:54.896 --> 05:56.647
If you release my brother
to the government,

05:56.773 --> 06:00.317
and he does what they want,
even if you fix him, he's dead.

06:00.444 --> 06:03.237
I need time
to convince him of that.

06:11.371 --> 06:14.081
Good news is,
if you screw up,

06:14.207 --> 06:17.334
you don't have to worry
about a malpractice suit.

06:18.086 --> 06:20.963
Instead, one by one,

06:21.089 --> 06:24.717
I'll take away the things you love
till there's nothing left.

06:29.598 --> 06:33.225
So, on the Mafia thing,
that's a yes.

06:43.820 --> 06:45.696
Did House
seem weird to you?

06:45.822 --> 06:48.824
Were you expecting him
to be weird?

06:48.950 --> 06:52.161
We spoke
about how we felt.

06:53.830 --> 06:55.539
You told him you liked him?

06:55.707 --> 06:56.707
No, of course not.

06:56.833 --> 06:58.501
What are you talking about, then?

06:58.627 --> 07:00.836
I asked him if he liked me.

07:00.962 --> 07:02.379
And why would you do that?

07:02.506 --> 07:03.631
Because...

07:06.426 --> 07:07.885
I like him.

07:08.261 --> 07:10.179
You like him, like him?

07:10.305 --> 07:12.431
Doesn't matter.
He doesn't like me.

07:12.849 --> 07:15.267
Hey, he doesn't like anybody.

07:18.021 --> 07:19.522
And nobody likes him.

07:21.066 --> 07:23.776
MRI showed
a subdural hematoma.

07:23.902 --> 07:25.778
Bleeding around his brain
caused pressure inside his head,

07:25.904 --> 07:27.947
which caused the coma.

07:28.073 --> 07:32.243
These look like pseudomembranes.
Those take time to form.

07:32.369 --> 07:34.453
If it's an old injury,
it wouldn't cause the coma.

07:34.746 --> 07:38.457
Patient history indicates
he was hit with a tire iron in 1996.

07:38.583 --> 07:40.960
Brother says he was changing a tire
and it slipped.

07:41.128 --> 07:44.463
An old hematoma placed where
this one is could have caused his coma.

07:44.589 --> 07:45.422
What about his liver?

07:45.549 --> 07:47.133
LFTs are slightly elevated.

07:47.259 --> 07:48.425
Key word is "slightly",

07:48.552 --> 07:51.262
as in not high enough
to cause the coma. It's the subdural.

07:51.388 --> 07:54.098
I say we evacuate the cavity,
see if he wakes up.

07:54.224 --> 07:56.851
The neurologist thinks it's his brain
and wants to open up his head?

07:56.977 --> 07:58.644
Frankly, I'm shocked.

07:58.770 --> 08:01.814
And you get to use the big boy drill
in Daddy's big red toolbox.

08:01.940 --> 08:03.440
No drilling.

08:07.737 --> 08:08.737
Hi.

08:08.864 --> 08:10.114
Mr. Smith.

08:10.907 --> 08:13.993
Call me Joe.
Can you not do that?

08:17.914 --> 08:20.499
So, we're clear
about the no drilling?

08:23.128 --> 08:24.920
He's okay now.
He can leave.

08:25.046 --> 08:26.088
I'm not releasing him.

08:26.214 --> 08:28.007
'Cause the brother
doesn't want you to?

08:28.133 --> 08:31.719
Or because he had an unexplained coma.
Which sounds better?

08:31.845 --> 08:33.053
The hematoma caused the coma.

08:33.180 --> 08:35.264
That's a catchy diagnosis.
You could dance to that.

08:35.640 --> 08:37.975
I think Chase is right.

08:40.937 --> 08:45.065
Well, it still should be evacuated,
but it's not an immediate threat.

08:49.529 --> 08:51.363
Cameron's my girl.

08:51.781 --> 08:53.282
I'd release him.

08:55.035 --> 08:56.160
Are you disagreeing
with me because...

08:56.286 --> 08:59.288
I'm disagreeing because
that's my medical opinion.

08:59.414 --> 09:01.207
Of course it is.

09:01.333 --> 09:04.835
But unless I've been named
as the fourth part of the axis of evil,

09:04.961 --> 09:08.672
invaded and occupied, this is still
not a democracy. He's staying.

09:08.798 --> 09:12.009
Send for hepatitis serologies
and an autoimmune panel.

09:23.688 --> 09:26.941
Hey, I'm with you.
Old enough to drink,

09:27.067 --> 09:29.568
old enough to do something
really stupid and make yourself a baby.

09:29.694 --> 09:33.030
He's my brother. I'm watching him
while our parents are in Barbados.

09:33.156 --> 09:35.991
He's having trouble breathing,
and there's a lot of wheezing.

09:36.451 --> 09:39.787
Whistling, technically.
Upper airways. Nose.

09:39.913 --> 09:42.831
If he's got the croup,
that could become meningitis, right?

09:42.958 --> 09:44.917
- Absolutely.
- I was just studying,

09:45.043 --> 09:48.545
and all of a sudden I hear him crying
and sounding all weird.

09:48.672 --> 09:50.839
My parents are gonna kill me.

09:51.049 --> 09:52.216
I doubt it.

09:52.342 --> 09:53.717
You don't know them.

09:53.843 --> 09:57.513
No, I doubt you were studying
while your parents were away.

10:00.642 --> 10:02.101
Hello, Officer.

10:04.646 --> 10:08.565
You might wanna rinse this off
before you let him play with it again.

10:27.335 --> 10:29.086
What happened?
Where is he?

10:29.879 --> 10:31.922
Vogler called Admitting.
Admitting called Justice.

10:32.048 --> 10:34.466
Justice came and took him away.

10:34.592 --> 10:36.468
And who called Vogler?

10:45.061 --> 10:46.603
He loses money.

10:46.730 --> 10:49.857
So does Ophthalmology.
Who cares? This is a hospital.

10:50.317 --> 10:52.067
You can't just cut a department.

10:52.193 --> 10:53.485
You can't control him.

10:53.778 --> 10:56.655
I am the only one
that can control him.

10:57.073 --> 10:59.700
D... D... Dr. House in the house.

10:59.826 --> 11:00.993
Impeccable timing
as always.

11:01.119 --> 11:03.412
You had no authority
to release my patient.

11:03.580 --> 11:08.167
My colleague has just informed me
she has a singular talent.

11:08.293 --> 11:11.086
You are just in time
for a demonstration.

11:12.797 --> 11:15.090
Dr. House, from what I understand,
your patient...

11:15.216 --> 11:17.760
"From what you understand"?
He's not your patient.

11:17.886 --> 11:19.636
How the hell do you
understand anything?

11:19.763 --> 11:20.679
It's sad.

11:20.930 --> 11:21.972
You're not even a doctor.

11:22.098 --> 11:26.518
John Smith is here
only because of a court order.

11:26.644 --> 11:29.229
I had the records faxed to the judge.
She rescinded the order.

11:29.356 --> 11:31.690
Why bother?
Just to piss me off?

11:31.816 --> 11:34.610
Keeping the government off our ass.

11:34.736 --> 11:38.072
Yeah. That makes no sense
for a public institution.

11:39.449 --> 11:40.407
Okay.

11:40.533 --> 11:41.950
"Okay", what?

11:42.077 --> 11:44.411
Okay, sir. Carry on.

11:49.125 --> 11:50.918
He really cares
about his patients.

11:51.044 --> 11:52.669
Yeah, and he just walked
out of here with nothing.

11:52.796 --> 11:54.630
Something's up.

11:56.007 --> 11:58.467
Just started vomiting
and passed out.

11:58.593 --> 12:00.803
More lidocaine. 590 with epi.

12:01.221 --> 12:04.264
Thirty-five-year-old male.
Vital signs are stable now.

12:04.391 --> 12:07.393
Gave him two liters en route.

12:07.602 --> 12:11.271
He was just released
from here two hours ago.

12:11.398 --> 12:13.023
You said he was good to go.

12:13.149 --> 12:14.108
Watch that line.

12:14.234 --> 12:16.068
He's still not responding.

12:18.655 --> 12:22.408
So, the junior G-man badge
isn't looking so good.

12:33.420 --> 12:34.461
His liver's worse.

12:34.879 --> 12:36.004
Comatose?

12:36.131 --> 12:38.340
No. Completely different
symptoms than the first time.

12:38.466 --> 12:41.301
His serology tests came back
positive for hepatitis C.

12:41.428 --> 12:45.097
Hep C is a chronic condition. You don't
think this is an acute situation?

12:45.223 --> 12:48.642
Coma, vomiting, abdominal pain.
Hep C explains everything.

12:48.768 --> 12:50.602
Except for the suddenness
of the onset.

12:50.728 --> 12:52.146
What's wrong with the timing?

12:52.272 --> 12:55.649
You get home one night,
your wife hits you with a baseball bat.

12:55.900 --> 12:59.778
Likely causes, the fact that you haven't
thanked her for dinner in eight years

12:59.904 --> 13:03.657
or the receipt for fur handcuffs
that she found in your pants?

13:03.783 --> 13:06.076
Sudden onset equals
approximate cause.

13:06.244 --> 13:08.203
He also has high estrogen levels
in his blood.

13:08.329 --> 13:10.539
That's indicative
of a chronic condition, not acute.

13:10.665 --> 13:13.584
One test. What do
his other liver tests tell us?

13:13.710 --> 13:17.045
Normal albumin levels
point toward acute.

13:17.213 --> 13:21.467
Oh, okay, and why is her test
better than mine?

13:21.593 --> 13:24.928
Because she's cuter,
though it's close.

13:26.097 --> 13:27.222
Do a liver biopsy.

13:27.348 --> 13:28.849
When the results come back,
we'll know what we're looking at.

13:28.975 --> 13:31.018
Why wait to treat the hep C?

13:31.144 --> 13:33.228
If I'm right, Joey gets better
that much faster.

13:33.354 --> 13:37.149
Right. Then he gets to testify.
And you get a gold star from Cuddy.

13:37.317 --> 13:41.153
And what's the downside?
Or is that the downside?

13:41.279 --> 13:44.490
Do I have a reason for not wanting you
to get any stars?

13:46.659 --> 13:48.702
Fine. Start the treatment.

13:48.828 --> 13:51.788
It's all your idea.
Don't even mention my name.

13:52.081 --> 13:55.000
There's nothing wrong
with your theory. Go.

13:57.712 --> 14:01.924
But in the humor me department,
get a biopsy while you're at it.

14:04.385 --> 14:06.762
Foreman, we need to talk.

14:13.436 --> 14:14.603
You're off the case.

14:14.729 --> 14:16.063
What? Why?

14:16.189 --> 14:19.483
Somebody told Vogler that I lied
to the transplant committee.

14:19.609 --> 14:20.484
You think I did?

14:20.610 --> 14:21.693
You're too careful.

14:21.819 --> 14:23.820
You wouldn't jump ship
unless you knew what was in the water.

14:24.030 --> 14:25.447
Stop.
You're embarrassing me.

14:25.615 --> 14:27.658
But I want Vogler
to think I think it's you.

14:27.784 --> 14:31.286
And I want Cameron and Chase,
Cuddy and Wilson, the nursing staff

14:31.412 --> 14:34.665
and the cashier in the parking lot
to think that, too.

14:36.709 --> 14:37.793
Right.

14:39.963 --> 14:42.839
The blood tests show
you have hepatitis C.

14:42.966 --> 14:45.217
It's a virus that infects the liver.

14:45.343 --> 14:46.677
No way.

14:46.803 --> 14:47.844
It's not all bad news.

14:47.971 --> 14:51.431
It can often be cured.
And even if not, it's manageable.

14:51.558 --> 14:52.683
How'd my brother get this?

14:52.809 --> 14:55.477
It usually involves the exchange
of bodily fluids, either...

14:55.603 --> 14:57.104
Bodily fluids?
What are you talking about?

14:57.230 --> 14:59.982
There are many ways the virus can be
transmitted. Sharing needles, blood...

15:00.149 --> 15:04.778
Hey! Nobody talks to my brother
like this, okay?

15:04.904 --> 15:07.030
Fine. No idea how he got it.

15:07.156 --> 15:10.909
But he has hepatitis C.
We're gonna start him on...

15:11.661 --> 15:15.872
He doesn't have it. Don't mention it
again. Don't treat him for it.

15:19.961 --> 15:25.382
House has some directed donations,
foundation support.

15:25.508 --> 15:27.426
It's around here.

15:29.429 --> 15:32.097
He makes you miserable.

15:32.223 --> 15:35.142
Eight years he's worked here.
Never made a dime for you.

15:35.268 --> 15:36.935
- Never listened to you.
- He can change. He's...

15:37.061 --> 15:39.771
He hasn't changed in eight years.

15:39.897 --> 15:43.066
Either he can't change
or you can't change him.

15:44.652 --> 15:48.614
You have no idea how many times he's
lied to you, undercut your authority,

15:48.948 --> 15:51.366
made you look like crap
to other doctors.

15:51.492 --> 15:55.662
Yes, I hate him, and here I am,
desperately trying to protect his job.

15:55.788 --> 15:56.913
What does that tell you?

15:57.081 --> 15:59.333
That you don't hate him.

15:59.459 --> 16:01.710
I do not protect people I like.

16:01.836 --> 16:04.087
I protect people who are
assets to this hospital.

16:04.339 --> 16:06.715
No. That's me.

16:08.468 --> 16:11.511
You... You're softer.

16:11.971 --> 16:13.096
Right.

16:13.222 --> 16:16.308
There are three female
chiefs of medicine

16:16.434 --> 16:17.934
at major hospitals in this country,

16:18.061 --> 16:21.188
and we all got there
using our feminine wiles.

16:21.314 --> 16:23.023
It's human nature to want
to protect people we like.

16:23.149 --> 16:24.232
I don't like him.

16:24.359 --> 16:25.692
To think if we just
form the right team,

16:25.818 --> 16:27.194
we'll all get along
and be able to pull the...

16:27.320 --> 16:28.945
I don't get along with him!

16:29.072 --> 16:30.405
This is not a team.

16:30.531 --> 16:31.782
It's not a boat.

16:31.908 --> 16:34.826
It's not a machine that has a lot
of parts that have to work together.

16:34.952 --> 16:39.373
The metaphors are all crap.
This is a business. That's all it is.

16:40.291 --> 16:43.085
You like him.
That's bad for business.

16:53.638 --> 16:55.222
Oh, this is all my fault.

16:55.890 --> 16:58.016
Took another homework break
with Betty Lou?

16:58.184 --> 17:00.185
No, last week
I showed him a magic trick.

17:00.645 --> 17:04.147
You pulled a quarter out of his nose.
It's a classic.

17:04.482 --> 17:07.275
Yeah, and now he won't stop
shoving stuff up there.

17:07.402 --> 17:08.860
Dr. House.

17:08.986 --> 17:09.986
Got a crisis here.

17:11.572 --> 17:13.031
It's okay.

17:18.788 --> 17:19.955
Stop!

17:36.222 --> 17:37.931
That's a neat trick.

17:38.057 --> 17:41.184
They have to believe
you'll actually hurt them.

17:48.276 --> 17:50.235
Your people insulted my brother.

17:50.361 --> 17:53.321
What, they put Romano
in the Parmesan cheese shaker again?

17:53.448 --> 17:56.450
Said he was a crack head
or a homo or something.

17:56.576 --> 17:57.993
Those idiots.

17:58.119 --> 18:01.538
How many times am I gonna have
to send them for sensitivity training?

18:01.664 --> 18:04.666
Nobody's saying he's a homo.
That would be really, really bad.

18:04.792 --> 18:07.127
So let's put a nice,
friendly spin on it.

18:07.253 --> 18:10.088
Let's go with, "He got raped in prison".

18:10.631 --> 18:14.050
I saw the jailhouse tats.
Put it together with the blood tests.

18:16.679 --> 18:19.931
There were rumors,
but Joey never said anything about it.

18:20.308 --> 18:23.852
If people find out
he's being treated for hep C...

18:25.062 --> 18:27.564
Feds get that chart,
someone says something to somebody,

18:27.690 --> 18:29.065
word will get out.

18:29.192 --> 18:32.402
And then Joey's manhood,
his rep, he's destroyed.

18:36.115 --> 18:39.367
You're worried about how his coworkers
will react at the Walmart in Des Moines.

18:39.494 --> 18:43.872
He's not going into Witness Protection.
I'm not gonna let that happen.

18:45.416 --> 18:48.084
Listen, I don't know
if you know about this,

18:48.211 --> 18:51.046
but mob businesses sometimes
keep two sets of books.

18:52.006 --> 18:53.089
One legit, one not.

18:53.216 --> 18:54.299
Exactly.

18:57.428 --> 18:59.304
You jerking my chain?

18:59.514 --> 19:02.140
Doctors are busy. Sometimes
they forget to write things down.

19:02.266 --> 19:04.768
Happens all the time.

19:04.894 --> 19:06.144
Thanks.

19:08.022 --> 19:09.481
Oh, and...

19:12.235 --> 19:15.695
Whatever you're not giving him
for whatever he doesn't have,

19:15.822 --> 19:17.197
is that gonna fix him?

19:18.866 --> 19:20.367
I doubt it.

19:30.837 --> 19:33.505
On your way to polish Vogler's car?

19:33.631 --> 19:35.715
Gone are the days
of the grumpy old doc

19:35.842 --> 19:39.594
seeing patients in the basement of his
house, getting paid a few chickens.

19:39.720 --> 19:40.720
How will I eat?

19:40.847 --> 19:43.056
You know what Cuddy's been
locked away with Vogler about

19:43.182 --> 19:44.933
all day today and yesterday?

19:45.059 --> 19:47.811
Floor polish costs
through the roof?

19:47.937 --> 19:51.523
You. Her secretary's been at the
photocopier all day with your records.

19:51.649 --> 19:53.316
That's all they're looking at in there.

19:53.442 --> 19:55.026
My car's been stolen.

19:58.072 --> 20:00.240
Or rein-car-nated.

20:07.790 --> 20:09.791
Pink slip.

20:09.917 --> 20:13.003
A gift from the Arnello brothers.

20:17.049 --> 20:21.261
You know, they're gangsters, sure,
but they're thoughtful, too.

20:23.514 --> 20:27.225
You can't keep it.
It's graft.

20:27.435 --> 20:29.477
No, no, no.

20:29.604 --> 20:31.396
Graft is if I tell him
I'll only make him better

20:31.522 --> 20:32.814
if he slips me a couple bucks.

20:32.940 --> 20:35.984
Or a payoff for something
I'm not supposed to do.

20:36.110 --> 20:39.029
If I'd asked for the payoff,
which I didn't,

20:39.155 --> 20:43.617
I would've done the bad thing anyway.
So there's nothing wrong with this.

20:43.743 --> 20:45.535
- Right.
- Damn.

20:45.661 --> 20:48.163
'65.

20:48.289 --> 20:50.290
Perfectly restored.

20:50.583 --> 20:54.794
What do you think a guy like Joey
would do if someone turned down a gift?

20:54.921 --> 20:57.339
That's kind of an insult, isn't it?

20:57.465 --> 21:01.593
He might hurt you.
It's definitely possible.

21:01.719 --> 21:04.471
I'm screwed.
Gotta take the car.

21:11.437 --> 21:13.188
Did you see House's new car?

21:13.314 --> 21:16.858
From Joey.
He obviously can't keep it.

21:16.984 --> 21:18.944
You don't mind the hospital
taking money from Vogler?

21:19.070 --> 21:20.904
That's different.
Vogler's legit.

21:21.030 --> 21:24.491
That's worse.
Vogler's money came with strings.

21:24.617 --> 21:28.370
Vogler doesn't set me up
to have a mobster take a swing at me.

21:28.496 --> 21:30.038
I'm sure House didn't know...

21:30.164 --> 21:32.123
Joey's pressure dropped.

21:32.249 --> 21:35.001
Pushed IV fluids,
now he's holding 100 systolic.

21:35.127 --> 21:35.961
Septic?

21:36.087 --> 21:37.963
No, it looks like
he's bleeding into his liver.

21:38.089 --> 21:41.508
Varices. See it with chronic hep C
all the time.

21:41.634 --> 21:43.510
Biopsy's back.

21:43.844 --> 21:45.929
Two findings. Number one,

21:46.055 --> 21:48.890
lymphocytic infiltrate
and no bridging fibrosis.

21:49.016 --> 21:52.143
Whatever's killing him
is not hep C. It's acute.

21:52.269 --> 21:55.397
Who said that?
I forget.

21:55.648 --> 21:59.275
What are you doing here?
I told you you were off the case.

21:59.402 --> 22:04.239
Right. Your diabolic plan to convince
the evil genius he's in the clear,

22:04.365 --> 22:06.992
so he'll let his guard down
and make a fatal mistake. Sure.

22:07.118 --> 22:10.328
Well, it's clearly
not gonna work now.

22:10.454 --> 22:12.288
What evil genius?

22:12.415 --> 22:15.542
If we knew that, we wouldn't need
a diabolic plan, would we?

22:15.668 --> 22:18.503
House thinks
someone ratted him out to Vogler.

22:18.629 --> 22:20.380
What, one of us?

22:20.506 --> 22:23.216
No, you guys
love me too much.

22:23.342 --> 22:26.052
All right, look. If it's not the hep C,
then what's the problem?

22:26.178 --> 22:27.429
What's causing the liver failure?

22:27.555 --> 22:30.432
Finding number two, toxins.

22:30.683 --> 22:32.684
No. He's only 30 years old,

22:32.810 --> 22:34.853
and his job doesn't expose him
to heavy metals or environmental...

22:34.979 --> 22:37.105
He's a 30-year-old mobster.

22:37.231 --> 22:40.150
He doesn't have a job that results
in accidental exposure to toxins.

22:40.276 --> 22:44.195
He has a job that results
in intentional exposure to toxins.

22:47.742 --> 22:49.659
Someone's poisoned him.

23:07.053 --> 23:09.804
Whatever this toxin is,
it's doing the job and fast.

23:10.347 --> 23:12.265
How long till we have
the next round of test results?

23:12.391 --> 23:13.266
About four hours.

23:13.392 --> 23:15.727
Too bad his liver's
only gonna last another two.

23:15.853 --> 23:17.187
We're gonna have
to get him a new one.

23:17.313 --> 23:19.564
What, in two hours?

23:23.819 --> 23:25.653
There is another way.

23:29.450 --> 23:31.201
Relax. It's kosher.

23:41.629 --> 23:43.463
This is so bizarre.

23:43.589 --> 23:44.589
Not really.

23:44.715 --> 23:48.510
We just take Joey's blood out
of his body and run it through a pig.

23:49.428 --> 23:53.348
The pig's liver does what Joey's can't.
It cleans the blood.

23:53.474 --> 23:57.227
Which we send right back to him.

23:57.353 --> 23:59.187
And the pig makes him better?

23:59.313 --> 24:03.775
Nope. Just buys us some time to figure
out what's poisoning your brother.

24:03.901 --> 24:07.070
Like nothing.
Like you do this all the time.

24:07.196 --> 24:10.073
Oh, we've basically got
a barn in the basement.

24:17.873 --> 24:19.249
Cross off hemlock.

24:20.251 --> 24:22.669
You thought he was being
poisoned by hemlock?

24:22.795 --> 24:24.754
Dr. Euripides tell you
to check for that?

24:24.880 --> 24:27.799
It grows wild by
the highways out here.

24:28.759 --> 24:31.386
So, how much
do you like House?

24:33.222 --> 24:35.181
- Chase has a big mouth.
- Yeah.

24:35.307 --> 24:36.474
He's probably the one
who ratted to Vogler.

24:36.684 --> 24:37.809
I don't think that he would...

24:37.935 --> 24:39.769
Does it hurt
when you're with House?

24:39.895 --> 24:42.272
Little pain in the tummy,
but it sort of feels good, too?

24:42.398 --> 24:44.232
I don't have the right
to show interest in someone?

24:44.358 --> 24:45.817
You absolutely do.

24:45.943 --> 24:49.279
And I absolutely have the right
to humiliate you for it.

24:49.405 --> 24:51.739
Anything?

24:51.866 --> 24:54.325
White blood count's low,
probably a result of the illness.

24:54.451 --> 24:56.327
Nothing to connect
to the liver.

24:56.453 --> 24:57.287
Is he a smoker?

24:57.413 --> 24:58.413
Let me check.

25:03.669 --> 25:07.422
Early signs of emphysema. He's been
smoking at least a dozen years.

25:07.548 --> 25:09.090
Eighteen.
You got that from the white count?

25:09.216 --> 25:11.509
Nope. Got that from the chest x-ray.

25:11.635 --> 25:14.304
White count just tells me
he's quitting.

25:15.598 --> 25:17.056
Two weeks ago.

25:27.693 --> 25:29.235
How's your tummy?

25:31.030 --> 25:32.614
Flat and taut.

25:33.490 --> 25:35.450
I've been on the job for 12 years.

25:35.576 --> 25:39.037
You put $3,000 in your wife's
checking account this morning.

25:39.163 --> 25:40.288
I wanna know
where it came from.

25:40.414 --> 25:41.664
I got a perfect record.

25:41.874 --> 25:44.667
Where did you get the money?

25:44.793 --> 25:47.045
Cancel the thumbscrews.
I've got our culprit.

25:47.213 --> 25:49.547
- Who?
- Not who, "Hu".

25:49.798 --> 25:50.965
Huh?

25:51.091 --> 25:52.592
Thanks for playing along.

25:52.760 --> 25:56.804
Chai Hu. Chinese herb
in his quit smoking candy.

25:56.972 --> 26:00.433
Reduces cravings.
Also reduces his white blood count.

26:00.559 --> 26:03.061
Oh, yeah. And he also took
enough of them to poison himself.

26:03.187 --> 26:05.021
We'll keep him on the pig
for a few more hours,

26:05.147 --> 26:08.024
and then take him off the candy.
He'll be fine.

26:08.275 --> 26:10.485
Pig won't be. Oh, no.

26:23.540 --> 26:24.666
Hey.

26:27.920 --> 26:29.837
Hey, feeling better?

26:29.964 --> 26:31.381
I'm famished.

26:32.341 --> 26:33.841
I think they got
fish sticks on the menu.

26:34.093 --> 26:37.053
Oh, yeah.
Makes me miss prison.

26:41.809 --> 26:44.310
So, the mobster's good to go?

26:44.436 --> 26:46.521
I'll keep him overnight,
then let the Feds know

26:46.647 --> 26:48.690
he's good to rat out
whoever he wants.

26:48.816 --> 26:49.941
Brother won't be happy.

26:50.567 --> 26:52.986
Maybe I have to give back the car.

26:53.112 --> 26:54.696
You should let Vogler
tell the Feds.

26:54.905 --> 26:56.114
Why?

26:56.240 --> 26:58.241
Because it matters to him.

26:58.367 --> 27:01.286
Because you humiliated him
the first time Joey was released.

27:01.412 --> 27:02.996
You think you should
still be in third there, ace?

27:03.122 --> 27:04.580
He humiliated himself.

27:04.707 --> 27:07.250
And because your job
depends on the kind of mood Vogler's in

27:07.376 --> 27:09.544
at the end
of his marathon with Cuddy.

27:10.212 --> 27:13.006
Seriously, man, have you ever actually
driven an automobile before?

27:13.132 --> 27:14.299
There are four gears,
you know?

27:14.425 --> 27:17.218
The '66 came with a "shut up" button.

27:38.657 --> 27:41.701
I have a problem
with the tests. I need...

27:44.121 --> 27:48.541
It is my medical opinion that the
patient is healthy and can be released.

27:51.420 --> 27:53.796
Thanks for letting us know.

27:58.302 --> 28:00.219
Get me the U.S. Attorney's office.

28:00.346 --> 28:03.348
I see you found out
what we're meeting about.

28:03.474 --> 28:04.640
You're having a meeting?

28:04.767 --> 28:07.352
Well, whatever the reason,
the coat looks good on you.

28:08.896 --> 28:11.981
Chai Hu lozenges cause
this kind of liver failure? No way.

28:12.107 --> 28:14.442
Not by themselves.
But in combination with the interferon

28:14.568 --> 28:16.194
it's like gas to a flame.

28:16.320 --> 28:17.445
What interferon?

28:17.571 --> 28:20.114
- For the hep C.
- What hep C?

28:20.574 --> 28:21.657
Oops.

28:21.784 --> 28:24.827
Is hiding a mobster's
hep C that important?

28:24.953 --> 28:27.080
Is letting the Feds
know everything that important?

28:27.206 --> 28:29.207
You know what?
You are a piece of work. Even now...

28:29.333 --> 28:30.541
Ed.

28:30.667 --> 28:32.001
Edward.

28:32.127 --> 28:34.212
Joey's back in a coma.

28:42.388 --> 28:43.930
He's stable,
but comatose.

28:44.056 --> 28:45.890
Worse than before.
He's on a ventilator.

28:46.016 --> 28:47.600
Question is, why?

28:49.478 --> 28:55.024
It's not his brain. It's not a toxin.
Our friend Babe helped with that one.

28:55.150 --> 28:55.983
So, what else?

28:56.110 --> 28:57.151
Hep C.

28:57.778 --> 28:59.153
We never really treated it.

28:59.279 --> 29:01.656
We stopped the interferon
when it started poisoning his liver.

29:01.907 --> 29:03.950
Am I gonna have to
write a song about it?

29:04.076 --> 29:07.578
His chronic hep C was not bad enough
to produce these symptoms.

29:07.704 --> 29:09.497
The estrogen level
indicates it is.

29:09.623 --> 29:11.040
It indicates
something else entirely.

29:11.166 --> 29:12.625
We can't give him
interferon now.

29:13.085 --> 29:15.253
There are still traces of the lozenges
in his system.

29:15.379 --> 29:16.337
It'll just poison him again.

29:16.463 --> 29:17.422
Genetics.

29:17.589 --> 29:19.507
We don't treat the virus,
we change it.

29:19.633 --> 29:21.884
A non-nucleoside
allosteric inhibitor.

29:22.010 --> 29:24.011
It's never been tried on a human being.
It could kill him.

29:24.179 --> 29:26.180
What's the difference?
He's dead without it.

29:26.306 --> 29:29.976
They're running a trial on dogs
at St. Sebastian's out in Philadelphia.

29:30.310 --> 29:32.437
I'll make the call.

29:33.397 --> 29:36.691
What else could cause
his estrogen level to be that high?

29:39.278 --> 29:40.570
Nothing.

30:01.008 --> 30:02.800
We're gonna put
the medicine in here.

30:03.218 --> 30:05.720
Don't want it to burn his veins
when it goes in.

30:05.846 --> 30:08.055
And you have no idea if it'll work.

30:08.182 --> 30:10.099
It's shown promise in testing.

30:26.366 --> 30:28.826
Maybe there's nothing up there.
I watched him like a hawk.

30:31.163 --> 30:32.455
Pretty sure you didn't.

30:32.581 --> 30:35.041
I didn't let him play
with any more little toys.

30:35.250 --> 30:38.211
Thus forcing him
to shove a big one up there.

30:40.214 --> 30:42.590
Stop, or I snap your nose off!

30:53.810 --> 30:56.270
He's not too smart.

30:56.396 --> 30:58.814
Genetics is a powerful force.

31:05.322 --> 31:08.324
On the other hand,
maybe he's smarter than you think.

31:11.328 --> 31:12.453
What's going on?

31:12.579 --> 31:13.913
Just give me a second.

31:18.627 --> 31:21.212
Always wanted to
use one of these.

31:28.053 --> 31:30.221
- Tilt his head back.
- I don't know. I...

31:30.347 --> 31:32.348
Just tilt his head back.

31:46.071 --> 31:49.198
Nice grasp of concepts.
Relationships.

31:49.324 --> 31:51.867
Very smart. Very cool.

31:51.994 --> 31:55.913
First the policeman,
the fireman, then the fire truck.

31:56.039 --> 31:59.542
Your brother was sending in
teams to save the cat.

32:00.586 --> 32:01.711
Wow.

32:03.088 --> 32:06.465
Sometimes,
the simplest answer...

32:47.007 --> 32:49.800
What types of comas
do you just snap out of?

32:50.135 --> 32:52.762
He's not snapping out of this one.
He's not improving.

32:53.764 --> 32:56.807
You've crossed out estrogen.
You got an explanation?

32:56.933 --> 32:59.602
Yes, I have.
A very simple one.

33:00.520 --> 33:02.271
And?

33:02.397 --> 33:04.231
It's private.

33:07.486 --> 33:10.863
You think I'm the one
running to Vogler.

33:12.157 --> 33:14.659
You're currently
top of the list.

33:15.619 --> 33:17.161
Toxic comas.

33:17.287 --> 33:20.456
Person's away from the cause
long enough, they recover.

33:20.582 --> 33:24.794
The Feds checked for poisons.
We checked for poisons. I didn't do it.

33:24.920 --> 33:26.462
It's not a poison then.

33:26.588 --> 33:27.672
An allergy.

33:29.758 --> 33:30.925
Did you hear me?

33:31.051 --> 33:32.677
What about a food sensitivity?

33:32.803 --> 33:34.387
All his food is strictly controlled.

33:34.513 --> 33:37.264
There's no correlation
between his meals and his condition.

33:37.391 --> 33:39.684
He had steak and potatoes
before the first coma,

33:39.810 --> 33:43.646
and the hospital served
fish sticks before the second one.

33:46.400 --> 33:47.983
You can trust me.

33:50.946 --> 33:53.572
Problem is,
if I can't trust you,

33:53.699 --> 33:56.325
I can't trust your statement
that I can trust you.

33:56.451 --> 33:59.286
But thanks anyway.
You've been a big help.

34:11.174 --> 34:12.925
So, where did you
get the money?

34:13.051 --> 34:14.051
What?

34:14.177 --> 34:16.220
Someone paid you off.

34:16.346 --> 34:18.389
What are you talking about?

34:18.515 --> 34:19.682
He wasn't poisoned.
You told us that...

34:19.850 --> 34:24.812
Who's talking about poison?
I'm talking about payoffs, graft.

34:24.938 --> 34:26.480
Leave him alone.

34:29.151 --> 34:31.736
You paid the marshal off.

34:31.862 --> 34:34.113
I didn't pay him
to poison my brother.

34:34.239 --> 34:36.991
No. It just worked out that way.

34:37.117 --> 34:39.910
I gave the guy some money
to bring in some decent food.

34:40.036 --> 34:43.622
Better than fish sticks?
I'm thinking steak.

34:43.749 --> 34:46.041
We asked for pasta,
but those stupid Feds could care...

34:46.168 --> 34:49.253
He had steak
before both comas.

34:49.379 --> 34:52.423
Your brother has
Ornithine Transcarbamylase Deficiency.

34:52.549 --> 34:55.050
Want me to write it down?

34:55.218 --> 34:59.221
Good, 'cause it takes a while.
It's genetic, can present at any time.

34:59.347 --> 35:01.140
If the patient eats
a large amount of protein,

35:01.266 --> 35:02.808
especially if he's not used to it.

35:02.934 --> 35:04.059
What, that's it?

35:04.186 --> 35:06.604
He just stays off the red meat,
and he's gonna be fine?

35:06.730 --> 35:09.857
Yes. If I'm right and we stop
the current treatment, he gets better.

35:09.983 --> 35:13.736
If we stop the current treatment
and I'm wrong, he dies.

35:14.070 --> 35:15.529
Why would you be wrong?

35:15.655 --> 35:17.198
His estrogen level.

35:17.324 --> 35:20.117
O.T.D. doesn't explain
his estrogen level.

35:20.243 --> 35:23.704
But I have a theory.

35:23.830 --> 35:26.791
There is one chemical that,
if ingested,

35:26.917 --> 35:30.503
can cause a person's estrogen level
to increase dramatically.

35:30.629 --> 35:33.005
- What is it?
- It's called estrogen.

35:34.549 --> 35:38.177
Joey's taking estrogen?
What? He wants a sex change?

35:38.303 --> 35:42.807
No, nothing like that.
It's called "Male Flame".

35:43.975 --> 35:48.145
It's probably more consumer-friendly
in the original Chinese.

35:48.271 --> 35:49.772
It's an herbal aphrodisiac

35:49.898 --> 35:51.690
- marketed to gay men.
- Here we go.

35:51.817 --> 35:55.152
And it's sold on the same Web site
that sells his Chai Hu lozenges.

35:55.278 --> 35:58.697
Guess what's in it?
It starts with an "E".

35:58.824 --> 36:00.950
You wanna get hit, too?

36:01.076 --> 36:02.409
That would be quite a trick.

36:02.536 --> 36:05.746
He slapped me so hard,
his brother turned straight.

36:05.872 --> 36:09.166
Joey's a big-time mobster. Guys
like that don't get raped in prison.

36:09.334 --> 36:13.254
They get gifts.
They get food, drugs, cigarettes.

36:13.380 --> 36:14.713
Cable TV.

36:18.301 --> 36:20.594
Joey is not gay.

36:20.720 --> 36:23.514
Maybe not gay,
but certainly delightful.

36:23.890 --> 36:28.853
You, on the other hand, hitting
a doctor, even if it was only Chase,

36:28.979 --> 36:33.858
and asking another one to keep
Joey's chart fresh and homo-free,

36:33.984 --> 36:35.609
that's a bit of an overreaction,
wouldn't you say?

36:35.735 --> 36:38.070
It's almost like you're scared
that it might be true.

36:38.196 --> 36:39.572
You're wrong.

36:39.781 --> 36:41.156
Okay.

36:41.283 --> 36:43.617
Then don't stop the treatment.

36:45.996 --> 36:48.330
But if you're wrong, he dies.

37:16.985 --> 37:18.152
Okay.

37:35.420 --> 37:38.589
He never said anything
to me about it, not once.

37:41.176 --> 37:46.472
That's what I love about you
mob guys, so tolerant of others.

37:46.973 --> 37:48.933
So accepting.

37:49.601 --> 37:53.187
Only way he was coming out
was way, way out.

37:53.313 --> 37:57.733
Lose the tattoos,
change his name, move to another town.

37:57.859 --> 38:01.028
How's a guy like him
gonna do that?

38:01.154 --> 38:02.655
Witness Protection.

38:03.531 --> 38:06.075
It's not just
for witnesses anymore.

38:06.201 --> 38:09.119
You can go in now,
sit with him if you want.

38:29.975 --> 38:31.058
How much longer?

38:31.434 --> 38:32.935
It's only been three hours.

38:33.061 --> 38:33.978
If it's the O.T.D...

38:34.104 --> 38:36.230
If it's the O.T.D?

38:36.356 --> 38:38.273
What if House is wrong, huh?

38:38.400 --> 38:40.567
That severe a reaction,
it'll take some time...

38:40.694 --> 38:43.070
He makes these assumptions
about people, talks you into things.

38:43.196 --> 38:45.072
Mr. Arnello.

38:45.657 --> 38:47.992
He's awake.
He wants to see you.

38:56.209 --> 38:58.043
You look like crap.

38:58.837 --> 39:01.630
That's a joke.
See? I'm sick. I said you look like...

39:01.756 --> 39:04.383
You have no idea
what I just went through out there.

39:06.344 --> 39:08.804
You kept getting worse.

39:08.930 --> 39:11.098
And Dr. House
kept saying all this crap.

39:12.767 --> 39:15.102
You know,
if I think you're normal,

39:15.228 --> 39:16.687
then he's gonna keep
giving you the medicine.

39:16.813 --> 39:17.730
If you weren't...

39:17.939 --> 39:19.231
Weren't what?

39:22.152 --> 39:23.360
Normal?

39:25.697 --> 39:26.905
Yeah.

39:29.617 --> 39:31.285
He said you were a fag.

39:33.246 --> 39:36.582
Witness Protection,
that's your big chance to be one.

39:39.252 --> 39:40.544
You believed him?

39:40.670 --> 39:43.297
I don't know what to believe.
You were sick.

39:45.425 --> 39:48.719
I had to make a decision.
I thought you were gonna die.

39:55.435 --> 39:57.770
You believed him.

39:57.896 --> 40:00.022
He stopped the medicine.

40:01.107 --> 40:02.524
Here I am.

40:10.867 --> 40:12.201
I wanted to talk to you
about this.

40:12.327 --> 40:13.952
There's nothing to talk about.

40:20.585 --> 40:26.090
You ordered
some Chinese Internet health crap,

40:27.634 --> 40:30.803
and they sent the wrong pills,
and you took them.

40:32.972 --> 40:35.390
Yeah, yeah. That...

40:37.227 --> 40:38.977
That must be it.

40:51.991 --> 40:53.909
You wanna testify?

40:55.829 --> 40:57.704
Go ahead.

40:57.831 --> 41:00.958
I told the doc.
He said it's okay.

41:01.709 --> 41:03.043
I don't expect you
to understand.

41:03.169 --> 41:04.711
I don't.

41:08.967 --> 41:12.177
All I need to know
is you're my brother, Joey.

41:14.097 --> 41:19.434
If you think this thing, whatever,
is gonna make you happy,

41:24.065 --> 41:25.983
then I think you should do it.

41:30.155 --> 41:31.613
You should.

41:40.915 --> 41:43.250
Vogler wants to fire you.

41:44.085 --> 41:45.919
Lose the whole department.

41:47.005 --> 41:49.965
Good thing you fought
for me though, right?

41:50.258 --> 41:53.510
Dress was a nice move,
but you gotta follow it up.

41:53.636 --> 41:55.637
Nasty weekend in Vegas.

41:55.763 --> 41:59.016
Something that shows off
your real administrative skills.

41:59.350 --> 42:01.393
He threatened to fire me.

42:06.900 --> 42:08.150
I'm sorry.

42:11.196 --> 42:14.907
So, how long do I have? I've got
a lot of personal stuff to pack up.

42:15.033 --> 42:16.950
And I assume you're gonna want
to throw a party.

42:17.076 --> 42:18.827
I told him I know
where the bodies are buried.

42:18.953 --> 42:20.662
The stuff he needs to know
that's not in the books.

42:20.788 --> 42:23.332
I told him
he can't ditch me.

42:23.458 --> 42:26.376
He's only keeping you on because
you know the secret handshakes.

42:26.502 --> 42:28.629
He's a quick study.
Six months, he'll have the moves down.

42:28.755 --> 42:30.672
- He won't need you anymore.
- I'll deal with that then.

42:31.758 --> 42:33.300
- So I stay.
- Yes.

42:35.303 --> 42:38.805
But some things
are going to change.

42:38.932 --> 42:41.934
Profits.
New world order.

42:42.060 --> 42:43.518
Everything's about profits.

42:43.645 --> 42:45.020
Yeah, that's real new.

42:45.188 --> 42:47.522
You could rent out the Corvette
every once in a while

42:47.649 --> 42:48.941
or lend it to a friend.

42:49.067 --> 42:51.568
That would be easy,
and it would be wrong.

42:51.694 --> 42:53.528
But Cuddy stood up for you.

42:54.030 --> 42:55.614
To a point.

42:55.740 --> 42:57.366
To what point?

42:57.492 --> 43:02.579
I gotta do six more clinic hours
a month. So do two of them.

43:02.705 --> 43:04.248
Why only two?

43:05.333 --> 43:07.417
'Cause one of them's gone.

43:08.670 --> 43:10.545
I gotta fire somebody.

43:27.230 --> 43:28.814
Good morning.
