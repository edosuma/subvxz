07:25.100 --> 07:27.066

goes down,

So you have a severe case

- Of the skin of the nose.

09:24.000 --> 09:25.533
- Yes, it is.
- So the goal would be

09:25.533 --> 09:28.066
to take down the hump,
making this straight by

09:28.066 --> 09:30.333
adding some cartilage
called spreader grafts,

09:30.333 --> 09:32.533
lift up your tip a little bit,
get it straight,

09:32.533 --> 09:35.734
fix the inside of your nose
also by performing

09:35.734 --> 09:39.200
something called a septoplasty
and a turbinoplasty.

09:39.200 --> 09:41.066
- That's a lot of plasties.
- That's--

09:42.467 --> 09:44.233
If we do this,

09:44.233 --> 09:45.567
you're gonna get
out of the house.

09:45.567 --> 09:47.066

09:47.066 --> 09:48.467

- Yes.

10:15.600 --> 10:19.333
- My name's Alysia.
I was misdiagnosed with cancer,

10:19.333 --> 10:21.500
and now I'm missing my breasts.

10:21.500 --> 10:24.633
I grew up in small-town Alabama,
and when I say small,

10:24.633 --> 10:28.000
when we got an Applebee's,
it was, like, the highlight.

10:29.400 --> 10:32.233
My mom left when I was
five years old,

10:32.233 --> 10:34.500
so I grew up really fast.

10:34.500 --> 10:37.133
It was kind of
a rough childhood,

10:37.133 --> 10:39.400
and my mom came back
into my life at 15

10:39.400 --> 10:41.500
because she had breast cancer,

10:41.500 --> 10:44.000
and she said she would love it

10:44.000 --> 10:46.467
if I would get tested
for the BRCA gene.

10:46.467 --> 10:50.100
15, I didn't think that I would
get breast cancer. You're young.

10:50.100 --> 10:52.400
You're like, "Yeah, whatever,"
and I didn't get tested.

10:52.400 --> 10:55.200
She kept after me ever--
year after year,

10:55.200 --> 10:57.367
and she would encourage me
and always say,

10:57.367 --> 10:59.500
"My insurance is gonna pay
for it, you know?

10:59.500 --> 11:01.400
If you could just go
and have it done,"

11:01.400 --> 11:04.166
so I finally went
and had it done.

11:04.166 --> 11:06.133
I was 24 years old.

11:06.133 --> 11:09.333

I am positive for the BRCA gene.

11:10.667 --> 11:16.033

through my situation

11:16.033 --> 11:17.400

and they carry around,

11:19.500 --> 11:22.567
like, all this hate,
but I really don't.

11:22.567 --> 11:25.166
I decided to have
the double mastectomy.

11:25.166 --> 11:27.500
When I took off my gown
for the first time,

11:27.500 --> 11:30.266
there was nothing there.
My breasts were gone.

11:30.266 --> 11:32.633
It was just skin
just hanging there.

11:32.633 --> 11:35.367
It was so disgusting to me.

11:35.367 --> 11:37.567
About six months later,
I went back in

11:37.567 --> 11:40.367
and put in silicone breasts.

11:40.367 --> 11:43.667
After the second surgery,
there was just gobs,

11:43.667 --> 11:47.300
really, of loose skin,
so I went back.

11:47.300 --> 11:49.200
The plan was
to remove the nipple

11:49.200 --> 11:51.533
and take some of the skin
that way

11:51.533 --> 11:53.433
and then put the nipple back on.

11:53.433 --> 11:57.600
After the third surgery,
I had scars around the areola.

11:57.600 --> 12:01.333
The nipples were facing
different directions,

12:01.333 --> 12:04.400
and there was still
all this excess skin,

12:04.400 --> 12:06.600
so I feel like we didn't
accomplish anything.

12:06.600 --> 12:09.266
Five years later,
I moved to Dallas,

12:09.266 --> 12:11.333

12:11.333 --> 12:13.433

to look good for him.

12:13.433 --> 12:15.166
I want to look good for myself.

12:15.166 --> 12:17.667
Why not request my records
from Alabama

12:17.667 --> 12:19.600

16:36.500 --> 16:38.266
with something happening
in the future.

16:38.266 --> 16:41.233
- When I look at your breasts,
you have laxity of the skin,

16:41.233 --> 16:43.266
which gives sort of
a cobblestoned,

16:43.266 --> 16:45.667
irregular appearance
to the soft tissue coverage.

16:45.667 --> 16:48.667
The nipples look a little
too low on the mounds,

16:48.667 --> 16:51.000
so they're almost
pointing downwards.

16:51.000 --> 16:53.500
The nipples are
further out to the side

16:53.500 --> 16:55.300
than they ideally should be,

16:55.300 --> 16:58.667

I was before, but--

17:11.700 --> 17:13.633
- Yes.

17:13.633 --> 17:15.667

is address three layers.

17:15.667 --> 17:19.467
There's the pocket, the implant,
and the soft tissue coverage.

17:19.467 --> 17:21.300
We're gonna make
the pocket smaller

17:21.300 --> 17:23.700
because if I don't
and I put a smaller implant,

17:23.700 --> 17:25.200
they'll just fall off
into your armpits,

17:25.200 --> 17:27.166
and then you're gonna
need a procedure

17:27.166 --> 17:31.000
that's designed to really
get the skin envelope tightened.

17:31.000 --> 17:34.600
When you have incisions
around the areola, the nipple,

17:34.600 --> 17:37.200
and you have tightening
of the skin around it,

17:37.200 --> 17:39.133
every time you do that,
it impairs

17:39.133 --> 17:41.734
the blood supply to the nipple,
so it's very possible

17:41.734 --> 17:46.133
they are at risk
of needing to be removed.

17:46.133 --> 17:49.700
But I would prefer to try
to do this operation

17:49.700 --> 17:51.734
without removing the nipples.

17:51.734 --> 17:53.600
- Whatever you can do
to make 'em look better--

17:53.600 --> 17:55.467
- As good as they can.
- Right.

17:55.467 --> 17:58.266
But I don't even mind
having the tattoo nipples,

17:58.266 --> 18:00.266
because it's like there's no

18:00.266 --> 18:02.100
feeling in 'em anymore anyway.

18:02.100 --> 18:04.367
My mom had hers removed.

18:04.367 --> 18:06.100
- Your mom had
her nipples removed?

18:06.100 --> 18:08.100
- Uh-huh,
and she had the tattoo nipples,

18:08.100 --> 18:10.100
which looked like real ones.

18:10.100 --> 18:14.166
- Okay, because knowing that
if your nipples do need

18:14.166 --> 18:17.734
to be removed and you're
perfectly okay with that,

18:17.734 --> 18:20.200
that allows me
a little more confidence

18:20.200 --> 18:22.200
in tightening the skin

18:22.200 --> 18:26.633
and a little less concern about
cutting off the blood supply.

18:26.633 --> 18:28.100
I sort of like that.

18:28.100 --> 18:31.233
You're like
the greatest patient ever.

18:31.233 --> 18:34.767
It's always best to use

the best cosmetic result,

18:37.200 --> 18:39.600

18:52.000 --> 18:53.667
- Okay. I'm excited for you,

18:53.667 --> 18:56.233
and know that the surgery
you've had up to this point

18:56.233 --> 18:58.600
has been completely necessary.

have a long, healthy life,

19:04.600 --> 19:08.000

by breast cancer, so--

19:08.000 --> 19:10.000
So I'm looking forward
to helping you.

19:10.000 --> 19:12.600

other things, so here they are.

- Thanks, we try.

20:08.066 --> 20:10.200

You both are good-looking guys.

- Yeah.

20:11.734 --> 20:14.166

20:14.166 --> 20:15.600
He's a good-looking guy,
don't you think?

20:15.600 --> 20:17.200
- I know, oh.
- Indeed.

20:17.200 --> 20:18.734
He can't stop talking about him.
- I'm a big fan.

20:18.734 --> 20:21.533
I think we could be
a power couple, honestly.

20:21.533 --> 20:23.333
- Obviously he'd be the power
bottom, I would think, right?

20:23.333 --> 20:25.400
- No, I think he's a top.

20:25.400 --> 20:27.700
- Yeah.
- Oh, that might work for you.

20:27.700 --> 20:30.066
Oh, God.

20:30.066 --> 20:32.333

that desk and rawr!

20:32.333 --> 20:34.200
Oh, I'm excited now.

20:34.200 --> 20:36.400
- You've had some procedures
on your nose, right?

20:36.400 --> 20:39.433
- I had nose filler
in the bridge of my nose.

20:39.433 --> 20:41.133
It was one of those, like--

20:41.133 --> 20:42.266
- Like, a Botox party.
- Botox party.

20:42.266 --> 20:44.333
- Oh.
- And, like, fillers

20:44.333 --> 20:46.033
and everything else, you know,
I had a glass of champagne

20:46.033 --> 20:47.667
in my hand and thought,
"Yeah, why not?"

20:47.667 --> 20:50.200
But as the needle went in,
I heard it go "crack."

20:50.200 --> 20:51.767
- Well, maybe
the needle hit your bone.

20:51.767 --> 20:53.633
When you're putting filler
in the face,

20:53.633 --> 20:56.066
it's not uncommon
for the needle to hit the bone,

20:56.066 --> 20:57.500
but not a crack.

20:57.500 --> 21:00.166
Maybe that crack was
the champagne talking.

21:00.166 --> 21:01.767
- What was the goal
with the injections?

21:01.767 --> 21:03.367
- He was like,
"I can make it more smoother."

21:03.367 --> 21:05.233
- Yeah, it was to make it
straight

21:05.233 --> 21:06.767
rather than have a hump?
- Yeah, just to--you know--

21:06.767 --> 21:09.100
- Fill the radix.
- Yeah, fill the radix.

21:09.100 --> 21:10.700
- Like, my nose is a penis
on my face.

21:10.700 --> 21:12.700
It just looks too big.

21:12.700 --> 21:14.100
- So you're interested
in having it

21:14.100 --> 21:15.200
surgically altered,
potentially?

21:15.200 --> 21:16.567
- Yeah.
- Okay.

21:16.567 --> 21:18.367
And, Bradley,
why are you here?

21:18.367 --> 21:20.200
- I had Botox at the same time
as him, little bit there,

21:20.200 --> 21:22.066
there, there, there,
there, there, there,

21:22.066 --> 21:23.300
but I feel like it
worn out after,

21:23.300 --> 21:24.767
like, two weeks, honestly.

21:24.767 --> 21:26.700
Like, these are your lines
back already.

21:26.700 --> 21:29.734
- Um, about a month.

21:29.734 --> 21:31.100
It should last three, though,
shouldn't it, so--

21:31.100 --> 21:33.066
- Average of three, but again,

21:33.066 --> 21:35.767
depending on how many units
of Botox the doctor put in.

21:35.767 --> 21:38.000
- Oh, okay.

21:38.000 --> 21:40.266
- If your Botox wears off, that
doesn't mean it didn't work.

21:40.266 --> 21:42.066
It's just time
to get more Botox.

21:42.066 --> 21:43.467
- And are there other procedures

21:43.467 --> 21:45.133
you're thinking
about doing, ultimately?

21:45.133 --> 21:46.767
- 'Cause I want a butt implant
as well

21:46.767 --> 21:48.266
'cause I feel like I do
so many squats and that,

21:48.266 --> 21:50.000
but it's still not
getting rounded.

21:50.000 --> 21:51.400
- Yeah.

21:51.400 --> 21:54.133
It's like a flat pancake
when you look to the side.

21:54.133 --> 21:55.200

for him.

21:55.200 --> 21:57.400
Terry's ass...

21:57.400 --> 21:59.133
Paul's ass...

21:59.133 --> 22:01.233
I'd rather have
my nice, round butt

22:01.233 --> 22:04.467
than his flapjack
of an ass any day.

22:04.467 --> 22:08.767
- I want to look like sort of
male Nicki Minaj, pretty much.

22:08.767 --> 22:10.333
- Okay.
Probably with you two

22:10.333 --> 22:12.166
we'll just examine you
at the same time.

22:12.166 --> 22:15.033
- Oh, this day gets better.

22:15.033 --> 22:17.166
He has these nice, light eyes,
don't you think?

22:17.166 --> 22:18.533
- Really nice.
- I don't know if there's

22:18.533 --> 22:20.033
gonna be a love connection

22:20.033 --> 22:22.166
between Ottavio and Paul,

22:22.166 --> 22:25.400
but what I do know is
I love seeing him squirm.

22:25.400 --> 22:27.533
- Thank you.

22:27.533 --> 22:29.166
- I like that lipstick.

22:29.166 --> 22:31.300
There's gold flakes
in it or something.

22:31.300 --> 22:33.300
- You can try it if you want.

22:33.300 --> 22:35.033
- Nervous giggling,
I'm thinking,

22:35.033 --> 22:36.700
"Yes, these are the signs
I've seen before.

22:36.700 --> 22:38.500
It's gonna work."
- This is the scary part.

22:38.500 --> 22:40.433
We're actually gonna
start cutting away

22:40.433 --> 22:42.767

22:42.767 --> 22:47.266
It's very unsettling to do this
much manipulation of a breast

22:47.266 --> 22:49.133
that doesn't have
any breast tissue.

He's ripped.

at the buttock.

23:18.467 --> 23:20.667
- Ooh, oh, God.

23:20.667 --> 23:22.433
- So there's two ways to do
a buttock augmentation.

23:22.433 --> 23:24.400
90% of it's done
with fat transfer.

23:24.400 --> 23:26.734
Obviously you don't have
any fat anywhere

23:26.734 --> 23:28.266
to be transferred
to your buttocks.

23:28.266 --> 23:31.133
The other way
is butt implants.

23:31.133 --> 23:34.633
The chance of a failure
is around 30% to 35%.

23:34.633 --> 23:36.200
- Yeah, particularly

23:36.200 --> 23:37.734
on someone who's so skinny.

23:37.734 --> 23:41.333
I think you're a very bad
candidate for buttock implants.

23:41.333 --> 23:43.467
- Oh, guys.
- It's a really bad idea.

23:43.467 --> 23:45.333
- Bradley's in fantastic shape,

23:45.333 --> 23:47.200
and I think it's a big mistake
for him to undergo

23:47.200 --> 23:48.700
a butt augmentation.

23:48.700 --> 23:51.300
Besides, there's nothing
wrong with a flat butt.

23:55.333 --> 23:57.233
- You actually were. Yeah.

23:57.233 --> 23:58.633
- Yeah, I probably was skinny.
- You were this skinny.

23:58.633 --> 23:59.633
- I think you're still
like that now.

23:59.633 --> 24:02.767
Yeah, yeah.

24:02.767 --> 24:05.500
- In--yes, go for it. Oh, yeah.

24:05.500 --> 24:08.333
- That's nice, you know.

24:08.333 --> 24:10.233
Okay, why don't you sit down...
- All right, my turn.

24:10.233 --> 24:12.433
- And I think that Dr. Nassif
wants to look at your nose.

24:12.433 --> 24:14.367
- All right, let's take a look.
- Yeah.

24:14.367 --> 24:16.533
- So right now you have
filler in your nose,

24:16.533 --> 24:18.266
and it's pretty much along

24:18.266 --> 24:19.667
the entire length
of the nose or just the upper?

24:19.667 --> 24:21.633
- Yeah, it's just
all along the bridge.

"Yes, these are the signs
I've seen before.

24:31.767 --> 24:34.400
It's gonna work."
- Normally a nose and the nasal

24:34.400 --> 24:36.600
tip takes about
up to two years to heal.

24:36.600 --> 24:38.400
I'm discovering with my patients

24:38.400 --> 24:39.633
that when they have filler
in the nose,

24:39.633 --> 24:41.400
it takes three years to heal.

24:41.400 --> 24:43.266
Filler likes water,

24:43.266 --> 24:45.266
and the more fluid
we suck in with surgery,

24:45.266 --> 24:46.600
the more swollen
you're gonna be.

24:46.600 --> 24:48.400
That is gonna prevent you

24:48.400 --> 24:51.266
from you guys doing
your little show together.

24:51.266 --> 24:52.667
You're gonna be really swollen,

if you'd be happy with that.

24:55.667 --> 24:58.567

some sort of arrangement, wink?

24:58.567 --> 25:01.300

25:10.233 --> 25:11.700
- No kissing.

25:11.700 --> 25:14.000

How about if I give you a hug?

25:14.000 --> 25:16.633

- Yeah, but the problem is,
he wanted to give me some.

25:31.700 --> 25:33.567
I could tell. It's because
that Dubrow got in the way.

25:33.567 --> 25:35.500

You'll never see him again.

- Morning.
- Let me show you a few things.

26:37.767 --> 26:39.767
We're gonna have to remove
a lot of your own tip cartilage

26:39.767 --> 26:41.433
and pretty much reconstruct it.

26:41.433 --> 26:45.633
The lower part is crooked,

26:45.633 --> 26:48.500
so we have to make
that straight,

26:48.500 --> 26:50.567
so you'll be wider
in the nostrils,

26:50.567 --> 26:52.500
smaller, God willing,
in the front,

26:52.500 --> 26:55.500
more symmetric,
straighter here.

26:55.500 --> 26:58.367
This is the computer morphing
right now

26:58.367 --> 27:00.467
just taking down your hump.

27:00.467 --> 27:02.100
- So much better.

27:02.100 --> 27:04.400
- Giving you a smaller,
less projected nose.

27:04.400 --> 27:06.400
Now, you obviously have to do,

27:06.400 --> 27:08.533
you know, your part of this,
which is to heal.

27:08.533 --> 27:12.400
- Yes. I was destined
to become the crazy cat lady.

27:12.400 --> 27:16.400
I was getting ready to sign
Alister's marriage certificate.

27:16.400 --> 27:19.734
After today, that's no longer
going to be a reality.

27:23.533 --> 27:26.400
- For Jessica's surgery,
my team will harvest rib

27:26.400 --> 27:28.333
while I open up the nose

27:28.333 --> 27:30.667
and perform a septoplasty
to straighten her septum

27:30.667 --> 27:33.133
and a turbinoplasty
to open up her airway.

27:33.133 --> 27:34.667
I will then use rib cartilage
to construct

27:34.667 --> 27:36.667
spreader grafts,
alar batten grafts,

27:36.667 --> 27:39.367
and rim grafts to fill out
and rebuild her nose,

27:39.367 --> 27:40.767
giving it structure
and symmetry.

27:40.767 --> 27:43.000
Finally, I will
reconstruct her tip,

27:43.000 --> 27:46.567
softening Jessica's profile
and giving her a cuter look.

27:46.567 --> 27:51.567
♪ ♪

27:51.567 --> 27:53.166
We got to dissect
out this cartilage.

27:53.166 --> 27:56.500
We have to see why
we got bossaes here

27:56.500 --> 28:00.433
and how can we get rid of it
without

28:00.433 --> 28:02.033
ruining the tip cartilage,
because, you know,

28:02.033 --> 28:03.633
when you have a bump
like that here

28:03.633 --> 28:06.033
and you just cut it out,
it can grow right back.

28:06.033 --> 28:08.400
Any time you have
bossae of the tip,

28:08.400 --> 28:10.367
which is basically remnants

28:10.367 --> 28:12.633
of the nasal dome cartilage,
you can't really fix it.

28:12.633 --> 28:14.433
Are we just gonna
cut 'em out?

28:14.433 --> 28:17.400
I know that's pretty aggressive,
but, you know,

28:17.400 --> 28:18.533
when you add a piece
of cartilage underneath it,

28:18.533 --> 28:20.300
you're just adding more bulk.

28:20.300 --> 28:23.033
The best thing to do is
to just cut it out,

28:23.033 --> 28:25.633
remove it,
use new cartilage there,

28:25.633 --> 28:28.433
and then cover it
with rib perichondrium,

28:28.433 --> 28:31.734
which is the very
vascular layer of tissue

28:31.734 --> 28:34.166
that lives on top
of rib cartilage.

28:34.166 --> 28:35.734
Let's take down the hump,

28:35.734 --> 28:38.533
open up the septum,
do everything else,

28:38.533 --> 28:40.400
and come back
to the tip at the end.

28:40.400 --> 28:44.400
Right here. Go. Go.

28:44.400 --> 28:45.734
Lateral osteotomies are done.

28:45.734 --> 28:47.667
They feel good.
They feel symmetric.

28:47.667 --> 28:52.433
We're finishing up the whole
upper 2/3 of the nose.

28:52.433 --> 28:54.000
Now let's work on the tip,

28:54.000 --> 28:55.467
and that's what's gonna
be the hard part,

28:55.467 --> 28:58.000
making the tip less projected,
smaller,

28:58.000 --> 28:59.600
but also opening up the airway.

28:59.600 --> 29:01.734
We're gonna have
to cut both domes.

29:01.734 --> 29:03.200
- Sure.

29:03.200 --> 29:05.600
- We don't usually
remove the domes,

29:05.600 --> 29:08.066
which are the natural pieces
of cartilage at the tip,

29:08.066 --> 29:10.033
but in this situation Jessica

29:10.033 --> 29:14.066
had sharp pieces of cartilage

29:14.066 --> 29:16.467
that were sticking up
on the right side,

29:16.467 --> 29:17.734
and the best way
to do this is

29:17.734 --> 29:20.500
to just remove it
and start fresh.

29:20.500 --> 29:21.500
- Hold on.
- Give me scissors.

29:21.500 --> 29:23.600
There you go.

29:23.600 --> 29:25.500
So here's our bossae.
Give me a stitch.

29:25.500 --> 29:27.433
- 5.0.
- Let's keep an eye--

29:27.433 --> 29:29.100
- The only reason why
I'm doing this is

29:29.100 --> 29:31.066
because there's that sharp
piece of cartilage

29:31.066 --> 29:32.633
right here,
and you can't shave it off.

29:32.633 --> 29:34.467
Once you shave it off,
it comes back.

29:34.467 --> 29:37.567
Here we go.
Here's the bossae. Boing.

a little bit too projected.

back the tip together.

extremely complicated.

Just when you think
you're done, you look,

like something,

It's what's giving you all
those contour irregularities,

31:13.734 --> 31:17.333
and it's the reason they don't
look as ideal as they could.

31:17.333 --> 31:20.400
- Knowing that I do carry
the BRCA gene

31:20.400 --> 31:22.467
makes this surgery easier.

31:22.467 --> 31:26.400

the mastectomy ten years ago,

about the blood supply
to the nipple.

32:07.767 --> 32:11.100
I'm worried about the blood
supply to the remaining skin

32:11.100 --> 32:14.033
because there's been
so many incisions and scars

32:14.033 --> 32:17.433
that if I don't leave
this blood supply intact,

32:17.433 --> 32:19.367
the skin could die,

32:19.367 --> 32:21.300
and that will expose
the breast implant,

32:21.300 --> 32:24.100
and this operation
will be a total failure.

32:24.100 --> 32:26.100
For Alysia's surgery today,
I will begin

32:26.100 --> 32:28.500
by making an incision
below the areolas.

32:28.500 --> 32:30.467
I will remove
her current implants,

32:30.467 --> 32:32.367
tighten the breast pockets,
and then

32:32.367 --> 32:34.500
insert a smaller pair
of implants.

32:34.500 --> 32:36.633
Finally, I will perform
a breast lift,

32:36.633 --> 32:39.667
hopefully giving Alysia
a normal contour

32:39.667 --> 32:41.600

You basically keep any remaining
blood supply intact

32:53.667 --> 32:56.066
because the scar itself
has very little blood supply.

32:56.066 --> 32:58.000
So here's the implant.

32:58.000 --> 33:02.667
It's important to inspect

33:18.000 --> 33:20.567
into her armpit
to accommodate a larger implant.

33:20.567 --> 33:23.400
Because we're downsizing her,
we have to close this off.

33:23.400 --> 33:27.000
This is called a capsulorrhaphy.
Hold this.

33:27.000 --> 33:30.300
Okay, so we're now gonna commit.

33:30.300 --> 33:32.300
This is the scary part.

33:32.300 --> 33:34.400
We're actually gonna start
cutting away

33:34.400 --> 33:36.533
a lot of breast skin.

33:36.533 --> 33:41.033
It's very unsettling to do this
much manipulation of a breast

33:41.033 --> 33:42.567
that doesn't have
any breast tissue.

33:42.567 --> 33:45.100
Breast tissue is
the main blood supply

33:45.100 --> 33:48.700
to the overlying breast skin
in normal breasts.

33:48.700 --> 33:54.433
You need to minimize the amount
of trauma you cause in her skin.

33:54.433 --> 33:59.133
Otherwise you will interrupt the
limited blood supply she has,

33:59.133 --> 34:01.533

36:12.033 --> 36:14.567
everything that we talked about,
brought the bones in.

36:14.567 --> 36:16.266
It was like a crazy roadmap,

36:16.266 --> 36:18.133
especially the middle part
of your nose that was crooked.

36:18.133 --> 36:21.133
We got that straight, worked
on the inside of your nose,

36:21.133 --> 36:23.166
the septum, opened that up.

36:23.166 --> 36:27.166
Your tip is gonna be
a lot cuter.

36:27.166 --> 36:28.667
- Good.

36:28.667 --> 36:31.767
- All this means is
when you're up to it,

36:31.767 --> 36:35.033
you're gonna pack your bags
and get out of your mom's house.

36:35.033 --> 36:37.567
- Yes.
- The only 32-year-old woman

36:37.567 --> 36:41.133
that I would want to live
in my house is my next wife.

36:41.133 --> 36:43.033
What do you think?
- I'm not gonna be a believer

36:43.033 --> 36:44.700
until I take it off.
- Well, that's okay.

36:44.700 --> 36:47.166
That's fair.
I'll give you that.

36:47.166 --> 36:49.734
- I see the difference.
It's huge.

36:49.734 --> 36:53.066
I know that this is going
to give her the boost

36:53.066 --> 36:55.700
that she needs to get on
with her life finally.

36:55.700 --> 36:57.734
I'm already planning
what I'm gonna do with her room.

36:57.734 --> 36:59.200
- This is gonna be a good
transforming for you.

36:59.200 --> 37:01.600
- If my new nose is as cute

37:01.600 --> 37:05.200
as Dr. Nassif says
it's going to be,

37:05.200 --> 37:09.066
Alister's days as my boyfriend
might be numbered.

37:09.066 --> 37:11.500
- You can start your life now.
- Yeah.

37:13.266 --> 37:17.600
- It took ten years and six
surgeries to get to this moment.

37:17.600 --> 37:19.066
Hey, y'all.

37:19.066 --> 37:20.667
- Hey.

37:21.734 --> 37:23.633
- You look beautiful!

37:29.233 --> 37:30.367
- ♪ I want to be perfect ♪

37:33.233 --> 37:34.500
You doing all right?

37:34.500 --> 37:36.300
- I'm hurting.

37:36.300 --> 37:37.433
- So the pain meds
aren't really helping that much?

37:37.433 --> 37:39.100
- If your pain level's an eight,

37:39.100 --> 37:40.734
it'll just take it
to, like, a four.

37:44.767 --> 37:47.500
So the nipples are alive.

37:47.500 --> 37:51.367
At least this one is.
I shouldn't speak so quickly.

37:51.367 --> 37:52.633
And so's that one.

37:52.633 --> 37:54.367
- Oh, wow.

37:54.367 --> 37:56.367
You see this?
Check this out.

37:56.367 --> 37:58.367
So remember
all that irregular skin?

37:58.367 --> 38:00.233
Doesn't this look like any girl

38:00.233 --> 38:03.233
who's had breast implants
and a lift?

38:03.233 --> 38:04.567
- That's amazing.
- Yeah, and look at

38:04.567 --> 38:08.233
the nipples
are also symmetric.

38:08.233 --> 38:09.567
- It looks really good.

38:09.567 --> 38:11.467
I'm so excited right now.

38:11.467 --> 38:14.667
It's just hard for me to show it
because of the pain

38:14.667 --> 38:18.000
and naus--the nausea
that I'm feeling.

38:18.000 --> 38:22.533
- The really bad skin
on the left breast was that.

38:22.533 --> 38:23.734
Remember all that stuff?

38:23.734 --> 38:25.400
- Oh, yes.

38:29.333 --> 38:31.400
- Oh, you're in that
much pain that you're--

38:31.400 --> 38:35.767
you're aware enough to rag me
about my broken pink case?

38:35.767 --> 38:37.500
- Yeah, that is a pink case.

38:37.500 --> 38:40.533
My phone case isn't pink.

38:40.533 --> 38:43.367
It's a rosé, okay?

38:43.367 --> 38:45.400
You are significantly smaller.

38:45.400 --> 38:48.266
You've got great
width-to-projection proportion.

38:48.266 --> 38:51.533
This is going to look as good
as any augmentation lift

38:51.533 --> 38:53.667
in any girl
who has regular breasts.

38:53.667 --> 38:56.166
- Awesome.
- If you heal.

38:56.166 --> 38:58.567
- I'm going to heal.
After seeing my breasts today,

38:58.567 --> 39:01.433
I'm very confident
that this is my last surgery.

39:01.433 --> 39:04.633
- There's not one millimeter
of irregularity

39:04.633 --> 39:06.166
in your breast skin.
- Awesome.

39:06.166 --> 39:09.000
- You need to keep
these together

39:09.000 --> 39:10.700
for eight or nine more days,

39:10.700 --> 39:12.300
and then we should be okay.

39:12.300 --> 39:13.567
- Okay. I'm super excited.

39:15.166 --> 39:17.166
- Yes. Thank you so much.

39:22.367 --> 39:24.233
- It took ten years

39:24.233 --> 39:26.700
and six surgeries
to get to this moment,

39:26.700 --> 39:29.166
and not only do
I look better in my breasts,

39:29.166 --> 39:32.700
but now I don't feel like
I even had a double mastectomy.

39:32.700 --> 39:34.600
Thanks to Dr. Dubrow, I know

39:34.600 --> 39:36.667
that all these surgeries
were necessary.

39:36.667 --> 39:40.066
I'm cancer-free,
and I can move on with my life.

39:40.066 --> 39:41.333
- You guys ready to taste
some wine?

39:41.333 --> 39:42.734
all: Yes.
- Let's do this.

39:42.734 --> 39:45.734
We'll start with the rosé.
Let's do a little smell.

39:45.734 --> 39:47.600
- I smell wine.

39:47.600 --> 39:50.066
- Mm-hmm.
- I'm about to see my friends

39:50.066 --> 39:52.333
for the first time
since the surgery.

39:52.333 --> 39:54.600
I'm excited for them
to see the new me.

39:54.600 --> 39:56.600
Hey, y'all.

39:56.600 --> 39:58.734
- Hey.

39:58.734 --> 40:01.567
- You look beautiful.
- Amazing!

40:01.567 --> 40:03.600
- Oh, amazing.

40:03.600 --> 40:05.467
Thank you.
- We hope that you feel

40:05.467 --> 40:08.734
as beautiful on the inside
as you are on the out.

40:08.734 --> 40:11.734
- Aww.
It's been exactly ten years,

40:11.734 --> 40:14.734
you know, since the beginning
of this long journey.

40:14.734 --> 40:17.633
I feel like now I'm at peace
with everything.

40:17.633 --> 40:19.767
I don't have to worry
about getting cancer

40:19.767 --> 40:21.633
and all that kind of stuff,
so I feel lucky.

40:21.633 --> 40:23.633
I feel blessed.
- Yeah, very blessed.

40:23.633 --> 40:27.367
- I really probably can't put
into words how grateful I am

40:27.367 --> 40:29.500
for Dr. Dubrow.
I love my breasts,

40:29.500 --> 40:32.300
and I just want to scream it
out to everybody.

40:32.300 --> 40:34.633
- Babe, you've come a long way.
- Before my surgery,

40:34.633 --> 40:37.300
I had a double mastectomy
to save my life,

40:37.300 --> 40:39.100
and after multiple surgeries,

40:39.100 --> 40:41.500
I was left with loose skin,
uneven nipples,

40:41.500 --> 40:43.767
and a constant reminder
of the disease

40:43.767 --> 40:45.633
that stole my womanhood.

40:45.633 --> 40:48.367
Now thanks to Dr. Dubrow
and his angel hands,

40:48.367 --> 40:49.767
I no longer look in the mirror

40:49.767 --> 40:52.767
and am reminded
of my traumatic past.

40:52.767 --> 40:55.300
Instead I only see
a bright future.

40:55.300 --> 40:56.500
- To your new beginning.
- Yes.

40:56.500 --> 40:59.066
- Yes.
- To Dr. Dubrow.

40:59.066 --> 41:02.300
- Yes, thank you, Dr. Dubrow.

41:04.400 --> 41:06.266
- I finally got my own place,

41:06.266 --> 41:09.000
and I am so excited
to be on my own finally.

41:13.600 --> 41:16.133
You look incredible.

41:21.133 --> 41:23.133
- ♪ I want to be perfect ♪

41:26.133 --> 41:29.000
♪ ♪

41:29.000 --> 41:31.734
- I have been waiting
for this day for so long.

41:31.734 --> 41:33.734
I finally got my own place,

41:33.734 --> 41:37.133
and I am so excited
to be on my own finally.

41:37.133 --> 41:39.567
Today my mom is going to get
to see my new place.

41:39.567 --> 41:41.367
She has not seen my nose

41:41.367 --> 41:43.166
since the swelling
has really gone down,

41:43.166 --> 41:44.700
so I'm really excited for this.

41:44.700 --> 41:46.567
- How has it been
since she's moved out

41:46.567 --> 41:48.100
and having the place to yourself

41:48.100 --> 41:50.166
and no Alister, no Jessica?

41:50.166 --> 41:52.033
- It's been awesome.

41:52.033 --> 41:55.033
- I love her, and I miss her,
and I miss Alister,

41:55.033 --> 41:57.033
but it's been great,

41:57.033 --> 42:00.166
just my husband and I having
the house all to ourself.

42:00.166 --> 42:02.033
I think--that's it right there.
- We're here.

42:02.033 --> 42:03.700
- That's it. That's it.
- It's on the left.

42:03.700 --> 42:06.667
- Looks great.

42:11.166 --> 42:14.367
- Ahh, look at you!

42:16.166 --> 42:18.700
You look incredible.

42:18.700 --> 42:21.200
- Like my new face
and my new place?

42:21.200 --> 42:23.200
- Oh, my gosh, I'm so happy

42:23.200 --> 42:26.066
for you that you're
in your own place now.

42:26.066 --> 42:28.600
- Come on in.
- Wow.

42:28.600 --> 42:31.200
- After 14 years
of just letting her life go,

42:31.200 --> 42:32.600
she is just happier.

42:32.600 --> 42:33.734
She just glows.

42:33.734 --> 42:35.600
It's about time.

42:35.600 --> 42:37.200
- We're going out soon,
so no more excuses.

42:37.200 --> 42:39.066
- We have to--
we have to go out, yes.

42:39.066 --> 42:40.734
We're gonna hit the clubs.

42:40.734 --> 42:42.734
- Absolutely, you and him.

42:42.734 --> 42:44.600
- Before my surgery I had

42:44.600 --> 42:47.200
a crooked nose
that only my cat could love.

42:47.200 --> 42:49.467
I wouldn't move out
of my parents' house

42:49.467 --> 42:51.066
to get a life of my own,

42:51.066 --> 42:54.734
but now my nose
is the cat's pajamas.

42:54.734 --> 42:56.600
It's symmetrical.

42:56.600 --> 42:58.734
It's smooth,
and it gives me the courage

42:58.734 --> 43:01.066
to spread my wings and fly.

43:01.066 --> 43:04.100
Now Alister isn't the only one
on the prowl.

43:06.433 --> 43:08.633
- Are you ready to let
your mom go out there

43:08.633 --> 43:10.200
and find a real man?

43:10.200 --> 43:12.633
- He's celebrating
his mama's success.

43:12.633 --> 43:14.467
- She is beautiful.

43:17.200 --> 43:18.767
- Guess who's back.

43:18.767 --> 43:20.433
My nodules.

43:20.433 --> 43:22.166
- I know what the inside
of you looks like.

43:22.166 --> 43:24.633
- You're the only guy
that has ever admitted to that.

43:24.633 --> 43:26.500
- "I know the inside"...

43:26.500 --> 43:30.433
- Yes, mama.
Headlines around the world,

43:30.433 --> 43:34.433
"Man spends $80,000
to look like Britney Spears."

43:35.633 --> 43:38.500
- If we put a new implant
on the left,

43:38.500 --> 43:40.500
you have to put an implant
on the right.

43:40.500 --> 43:42.734
What the hell is that?
