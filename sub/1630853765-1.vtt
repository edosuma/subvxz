What?

What?

45:50.320 --> 45:53.360
The point is, this is no time
for celebrating!

45:53.600 --> 45:55.920
It's time to double your efforts
and train even harder!

Wow! Thank you!
But I can't go, I...

46:39.800 --> 46:42.600
I promised my teacher I'd stay
focused on my training.

46:42.640 --> 46:44.400
Right. Sounds like
your teacher is someone

46:44.440 --> 46:47.680
who's unhappy and wants
everyone else to be unhappy too.

46:47.720 --> 46:50.080

You like fun, don't you?

01:10:40.760 --> 01:10:44.000
Yeah, sure! It took years
to work my way up through the ranks,

01:10:44.040 --> 01:10:45.440
but look at me now!

01:10:45.840 --> 01:10:47.160
What happened to you?

01:10:47.200 --> 01:10:48.840
I was shamed, my lord.

01:10:48.880 --> 01:10:51.400
I am so, so sorry.

01:10:51.440 --> 01:10:52.600
I ruined your birthday.

01:10:52.640 --> 01:10:55.960

Best birthday party I ever had.

that was a real surprise.

I tell that story all the time,
always brings the house down!

01:11:05.160 --> 01:11:06.600
And... the stuff with your in-laws?

01:11:06.640 --> 01:11:09.440
My in-laws? Oh, please,
don't get me started.

01:11:09.480 --> 01:11:11.080
In-laws you don't pick.

01:11:11.320 --> 01:11:14.760
Friends, you choose.
And you, Jimbo, are my friend.

01:11:15.600 --> 01:11:17.000
So, you forgive me?

01:11:17.120 --> 01:11:19.080
Forgiven, forgotten, no biggie.

01:11:19.120 --> 01:11:22.040
Hey, life's short.
Like me. Let's move on!

01:11:23.320 --> 01:11:25.080
So, what's up with the dog?

01:11:25.160 --> 01:11:27.640
That "dog" was defending Kakamucho.

01:11:27.800 --> 01:11:31.480
A dog defending the town? Why?

01:11:31.520 --> 01:11:33.480
Because Lord Ika here
was trying to get rid of it.

01:11:33.520 --> 01:11:35.840
Don't believe him. I was just
trying to get rid of that dog!

01:11:35.880 --> 01:11:39.160
You see? Nike Shoe was only
trying to get rid of the dog.

01:11:39.200 --> 01:11:41.960
But sir,
that dog isn't what you think he is.

01:11:42.000 --> 01:11:44.160
He isn't? I'm not following you.

01:11:44.360 --> 01:11:47.400
Can someone else explain this?
Allow me...

01:11:47.440 --> 01:11:48.800
Ika Chu wanted to get rid of the dog

01:11:48.840 --> 01:11:50.600
because he was getting
in the way of his plan

01:11:50.640 --> 01:11:52.320
to frighten the cats of Kakamucho

01:11:52.360 --> 01:11:54.560
so that he could wipe their town
off the map

01:11:54.600 --> 01:11:57.840

absolutely perfect.

# And even bigger ham balls

01:22:55.480 --> 01:22:57.800
# H-A-N-K, Hank #

01:22:57.840 --> 01:23:01.520
There's lots of cats in this world,
but nobody chases tails, his own,

01:23:01.560 --> 01:23:03.680
or anybody else as good as Hank.

01:23:03.720 --> 01:23:05.120
# Yeah we know it #

01:23:05.920 --> 01:23:08.520
It's like he's got nine lives,
and he's living them all

01:23:08.560 --> 01:23:10.240
at the same time.

01:23:10.280 --> 01:23:11.800
And to the fullest.

01:23:11.840 --> 01:23:13.520
# He won't blow it

01:23:13.560 --> 01:23:15.640
# Oh sure, he's kinda scrawny
And should go to the gym

01:23:15.680 --> 01:23:17.200
# But he's got a certain
Je ne sais quoi

01:23:17.240 --> 01:23:18.960
# Say what
Some bullies were mercilessly

01:23:19.000 --> 01:23:20.000
# Picking on him

01:23:20.040 --> 01:23:22.200
# So a samurai appeared
To save his butt

01:23:22.240 --> 01:23:24.200
# So now he's on a mission
To be a big deal

01:23:24.240 --> 01:23:26.040
# Gonna make some evil-doers
Taste his steel

01:23:26.080 --> 01:23:29.200
# You're much safer
When this cat's nearby

01:23:29.240 --> 01:23:30.640
# Me-e-ow

01:23:30.920 --> 01:23:33.200
# Try to fight this cat
The fur will fly

01:23:33.240 --> 01:23:34.640
# Pow, pow, pow

01:23:35.280 --> 01:23:37.120
# If someone dares
To break the law

01:23:37.160 --> 01:23:40.480
# They'll face the fury
Of the paws of Hank

01:23:41.720 --> 01:23:43.480
# His coat has got
A healthy sheen

01:23:43.520 --> 01:23:47.640
# Nobody licks himself
As clean as Hank

01:23:47.680 --> 01:23:50.080
# He sees the world
in black and white

01:23:50.160 --> 01:23:52.760
# A canine samurai
That's right, he's... #

01:23:52.800 --> 01:23:54.680
What, a canine? Hank is a dog?

01:23:54.720 --> 01:23:56.520
I thought we were singing
about a cat.

01:23:56.560 --> 01:23:59.200
He's the coolest cat,
who happens to be a dog.

01:23:59.240 --> 01:24:01.960
Nuh-uh, no way!
We're out of here!

01:24:02.000 --> 01:24:05.040
A slobbering dog
can't be no samurai! Please!

01:24:05.520 --> 01:24:06.960
# Hold your head high, Hank...

01:24:07.000 --> 01:24:09.120
..'Cause you're gonna
show 'em all...

01:24:09.160 --> 01:24:11.040
# ..That even with the bones
You chew

01:24:11.080 --> 01:24:13.240
# And your breath that smells
Like doggy-doo

01:24:13.280 --> 01:24:15.400
# 'Cause when I come dancing
I got you

01:24:15.440 --> 01:24:18.120
# 'Cause you're
The coolest cat #

01:24:18.160 --> 01:24:21.320
Even if you're a dog.

01:24:21.360 --> 01:24:22.760
# UNDERDOG #

01:26:05.040 --> 01:26:06.440
# I AM THE GREATEST #

01:33:19.720 --> 01:33:22.520
Ugh, dog-gone it.

01:33:22.560 --> 01:33:25.400
Still. At least I don't have to do
the sequel.
