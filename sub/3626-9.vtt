[Gossip girl]
Gossip girl here,
your one and only source

00:04.047 --> 00:05.614
into the scandalous
lives of Manhattan's elite.

00:05.701 --> 00:08.530
So, you confided in Dan
and even Blair.Everyone but me.

00:08.617 --> 00:11.185
So that's it?
We can't even be friends?

00:11.272 --> 00:13.143
Well, we were never
really friends, remember?

00:13.230 --> 00:15.189
Hope you don't mind, but
we've, uh, we've got a lodger.

00:15.276 --> 00:18.018
- Make yourself at home.
- 'Have you seen my sketchbook?'

00:18.105 --> 00:19.802
- Whoa, sorry! Oh, my..
- Oh, my God.

00:19.889 --> 00:21.151
Yale is your dream, and you

00:21.238 --> 00:22.587
deserve to go
here more than I do.

00:22.674 --> 00:24.154
- You can't share this.
- We'll find a way.

00:24.241 --> 00:25.808
I'm gonna give you
a second chance.

00:25.895 --> 00:27.679
If you can tell me the fate
of Cecil the caterpillar

00:27.766 --> 00:29.072
I will go out with you.

00:29.159 --> 00:30.987
I just realized that
I-I do know Aaron.

00:31.074 --> 00:33.250
We went to summer
camp together. We got married.

00:33.337 --> 00:35.165
There was a small ceremony
with licorice rings.

00:35.252 --> 00:36.906
You should do
your own clothing line.

00:36.993 --> 00:38.951
I can model them.
Max will do some photos.

00:39.039 --> 00:40.344
That guy was taking
advantage of you.

00:40.431 --> 00:42.172
You are not my father,
and you are not my brother

00:42.259 --> 00:43.565
so why do you care so much?

00:45.306 --> 00:46.524
Can I at least have
my dress back?

00:46.611 --> 00:48.309
You touch this dress,
you will never

00:48.396 --> 00:49.614
set foot in here again.

00:52.530 --> 00:53.966
And who am I?

00:54.054 --> 00:57.361
That's not a secret
I'll never tell.

00:57.448 --> 00:59.102
You know you love me.

00:59.189 --> 01:01.322
XOXO.

01:01.409 --> 01:02.540
Gossip Girl.

01:03.628 --> 01:05.152
Spotted at Mood

01:05.239 --> 01:07.980
Jenny Humphrey
buying 16 yards of tulle.

01:08.068 --> 01:09.808
But since when
does Eleanor Waldorf

01:09.895 --> 01:12.246
pay for her purchases
with a penny jar?

01:12.333 --> 01:14.683
They say a stitch
in time saves nine.

01:14.770 --> 01:16.163
Will it save little J?

01:16.250 --> 01:19.166
We are going
to blow them away.

01:19.253 --> 01:22.169
We better,
otherwise I am so dead.

01:22.256 --> 01:23.518
Dude, have you seen the time?

01:23.605 --> 01:24.562
At least your brother
and the lodger

01:24.649 --> 01:25.781
went to go see a movie.

01:25.868 --> 01:26.782
Yeah, that's
Nate avoiding

01:26.869 --> 01:27.870
me once again.

01:27.957 --> 01:29.437
He's still acting like

01:29.524 --> 01:30.829
he didn't stick his tongue
down your throat?

01:30.916 --> 01:32.353
Yeah. Ew.

01:32.440 --> 01:33.571
'Well, amnesia doesn't
really happen till'

01:33.658 --> 01:34.833
aftersex with guys.

01:34.920 --> 01:36.487
- So what's his problem?
- I don't know.

01:36.574 --> 01:38.185
He used to date Vanessa?

01:38.272 --> 01:40.361
I'm Dan's little sister?
Too young? I wouldn't know.

01:40.448 --> 01:41.710
- We don't talk.
- So what?

01:41.797 --> 01:43.581
After tonight
you'll be so famous

01:43.668 --> 01:45.540
you'll have
ten Nate Archibalds.

01:45.627 --> 01:47.019
Yeah, except
I only want the one.

01:47.107 --> 01:49.196
Okay, fine, then you
have to make the move.

01:49.283 --> 01:50.675
'That's the only way
it's gonna work.'

01:50.762 --> 01:52.634
- Oh, my God. Is that the time?
- I told you.

01:52.721 --> 01:54.070
Okay, yeah.
You need to sew way faster

01:54.157 --> 01:55.332
'cause we are so screwed.

01:55.419 --> 01:56.377
'Ready or not,
we're putting on'

01:56.464 --> 01:58.422
'a fashion show.'

01:58.509 --> 02:00.207
I just.. I really think
they're up to something, man

02:00.294 --> 02:01.599
with their closed doors

02:01.686 --> 02:02.992
and this private thing for
Eleanor.

02:03.079 --> 02:04.776
Jenny, she didn't say
anything to you?

02:04.863 --> 02:08.215
Uh, no, no. But we haven't
talked much this week, so..

02:08.302 --> 02:10.086
She seemed weirdly happy that
we were leaving the house.

02:10.173 --> 02:11.479
Like how much privacy
does she really need

02:11.566 --> 02:13.307
to watch "Project Runway"
and eat pizza?

02:13.394 --> 02:15.352
[cellphone rings]
Oh, oh. Hold on a second.

02:15.439 --> 02:18.834
- Ooh, it's Jordan.
- Who?

02:18.921 --> 02:21.141
The, uh, you know,
the TA from Yale.

02:23.273 --> 02:24.579
She was trying to get
me a recommendation?

02:24.666 --> 02:26.363
You-you
hooked up with her.

02:26.450 --> 02:29.801
Oh, yeah, that's
right. Jordan.

02:29.888 --> 02:33.196
Oh, it's good to be Nate.

02:33.283 --> 02:34.980
"I had three professors
read your stories

02:35.067 --> 02:36.504
I'll call you later."

02:36.591 --> 02:37.679
- That sounds like good news.
- Good? No.

02:37.766 --> 02:38.984
It means she
had the first one read it.

02:39.071 --> 02:40.377
He didn't like it.
Neither did the second

02:40.464 --> 02:42.858
and after the third,
she probably just gave up.

02:42.945 --> 02:44.599
And why text before
calling if you don't need

02:44.686 --> 02:45.817
to soften the blow?

02:45.904 --> 02:47.428
Or she was somewhere
she couldn't talk

02:47.515 --> 02:49.517
so she sent a text.

02:49.604 --> 02:52.215
With an imagination like that,
you should be a writer.

02:52.302 --> 02:53.564
Hey, where
are you going?

02:53.651 --> 02:55.392
I-I can't concentrate
on a movie right now.

02:55.479 --> 02:59.135
I-I-I gotta.. I gotta go
home and stare at my phone.

02:59.222 --> 03:02.225
Maybe you could talk to Jenny,
figure out what's going on.

03:02.312 --> 03:04.053
Yeah, yeah, that
sounds like a great idea.

03:07.099 --> 03:09.058
My father went to Yale,
and I've wanted to go there

03:09.145 --> 03:10.059
ever since
I was a little girl.

03:10.146 --> 03:11.147
How nice.

03:11.234 --> 03:12.409
So, Serena, tell me about

03:12.496 --> 03:13.889
Karl Lagerfeld's birthday party.

03:13.976 --> 03:15.456
[Serena]
'Oh, it-it was fun'

03:15.543 --> 03:17.588
but did you know
Blair's mother is a designer?

03:21.462 --> 03:23.855
You know, when Dean Berube
suggested I meet with you

03:23.942 --> 03:26.554
'I had no idea you
would be such a delight.'

03:26.641 --> 03:28.077
[male #1]
'Yes, thank you. Bye.'

03:28.164 --> 03:30.775
Oh, excuse me.
My husband's on his way out.

03:30.862 --> 03:32.386
Malchus, this is
Serena Van Der Woodsen.

03:32.473 --> 03:33.735
Good afternoon.

03:33.822 --> 03:35.127
Hi, and my best friend
Blair Waldorf.

03:35.215 --> 03:36.346
Pleased to meet you.

03:38.348 --> 03:40.611
[sighs]

03:40.698 --> 03:41.830
[whispering]
What am I doing here?

03:41.917 --> 03:43.353
Liz and her husband
are both prominent

03:43.440 --> 03:44.920
Yale donors and good
friends with the dean.

03:45.007 --> 03:46.095
Well, just like their
good friend the dean

03:46.182 --> 03:47.096
they only have
eyes for you.

03:47.183 --> 03:48.663
Come on, B,
you can do this.

03:48.750 --> 03:52.754
Yale is your dream. Just
stop cracking your knuckles.

03:52.841 --> 03:54.321
Well, as pleasant
as this has been

03:54.408 --> 03:55.583
I'm afraid I'm going
to have to run.

03:55.670 --> 03:57.454
'My husband's off
to his business dinner'

03:57.541 --> 03:59.195
and before I meet
my friends from Bryn Mawr

03:59.282 --> 04:01.066
I have to order room
service for my daughter.

04:01.153 --> 04:03.504
Oh, no. She's gonna be here
by herself all night?

04:03.591 --> 04:07.203
Oh, Emma doesn't mind. As long
as she has her Harry Potter book

04:07.290 --> 04:09.640
'and a bowl of ice cream,
she's happy as a clam.'

04:09.727 --> 04:12.382
Uh, no, Blair will
take her to a movie.

04:12.469 --> 04:13.949
I-I would take her myself

04:14.036 --> 04:15.733
but I've got something
with my family, so..

04:15.820 --> 04:17.909
'Why, Emma would love that.'

04:17.996 --> 04:20.260
You sure you don't mind?
Emma, dear?

04:20.347 --> 04:23.175
- Come here.
- Yale.

04:23.263 --> 04:25.265
Anything for the friends
of Dean Berube.

04:28.833 --> 04:30.922
- 'Yes, mother?'
- Serena's friend..

04:31.009 --> 04:32.446
Blair.

04:32.533 --> 04:33.882
Yes, would like
to take you to a movie.

04:33.969 --> 04:35.275
Oh, thank you.

04:41.629 --> 04:43.674
This is gonna be fun.

04:43.761 --> 04:44.893
Yeah.

04:49.898 --> 04:52.248
Hello.

04:52.335 --> 04:54.859
Hey. Um, what
are you doing here?

04:54.946 --> 04:57.384
Uh, I just had a meeting
with the collector.

04:57.471 --> 04:58.994
So did you figure out..

04:59.081 --> 05:01.126
Cecil the caterpillar.
Camp Suisse.

05:01.213 --> 05:03.390
We got married
and exchanged licorice rings.

05:03.477 --> 05:04.913
And you ate your five minutes
after the ceremony.

05:05.000 --> 05:06.741
- Yeah.
- When did you finally remember?

05:06.828 --> 05:09.526
Um, about the time you were
speeding away with a girl

05:09.613 --> 05:10.919
on the back
of your motorcycle.

05:11.006 --> 05:12.964
Audra.
Yeah, she's just a friend.

05:13.051 --> 05:15.967
No, I recognized you the moment
you walked in the gallery.

05:16.054 --> 05:17.621
No, you didn't,
but it's okay.

05:17.708 --> 05:19.188
Some faces you
don't forget.

05:21.146 --> 05:22.931
Um..

05:23.018 --> 05:24.802
You know,
I have this charity gala.

05:24.889 --> 05:26.804
It's actually here,
and I wouldn't normally go

05:26.891 --> 05:28.806
but my mom's being honored
and my brother's outta town.

05:28.893 --> 05:31.679
- And I'm rambling--
- I'm late! I know.

05:33.420 --> 05:34.551
I'm sorry.

05:36.510 --> 05:38.903
Hey, uh, maybe
in another nine years.

05:40.949 --> 05:42.080
What was that about?

05:44.256 --> 05:46.563
[Agnes]
'Jenny, come on.
The van is almost here.'

05:46.650 --> 05:49.131
Eleanor's going to kill
herself after tonight.

05:49.218 --> 05:50.872
[Jenny]
'I know. I just have
a few more things to do.'

05:52.613 --> 05:53.962
Dan?

05:54.049 --> 05:55.703
'What are you doing here?'

05:55.790 --> 05:58.836
I spy with my little eye..

05:58.923 --> 06:01.012
...someone getting busted.

06:01.099 --> 06:02.362
[Emma]
'Is my mom gone?'

06:02.449 --> 06:04.146
Yes.

06:04.233 --> 06:06.409
So what kinda
movies do you like?

06:06.496 --> 06:09.760
Something where
the animals sing or--

06:09.847 --> 06:11.109
Oh, sweet heaven.

06:11.196 --> 06:13.155
So, Muffy McDonough's
been bragging

06:13.242 --> 06:14.809
about how she's gonna
lose her virginity

06:14.896 --> 06:15.897
'cause she finally landed
a date

06:15.984 --> 06:17.159
with the lacrosse captain.

06:17.246 --> 06:19.335
They call him
"The De-virginator."

06:19.422 --> 06:21.163
Oh, my God.
Stop your mouth from moving.

06:21.250 --> 06:23.252
But now that I finally have
the night away from mom and dad

06:23.339 --> 06:24.427
we'll see who's first.

06:24.514 --> 06:26.560
I'm saying TTFN
to my you know what.

06:26.647 --> 06:29.171
Or maybe we'll see
how your mom feels

06:29.258 --> 06:31.042
about your little
clearance sale, Lohan.

06:31.129 --> 06:34.219
Please. I heard you talking
about getting into Yale.

06:34.306 --> 06:35.917
Well, Dean Berube
is, like, my uncle

06:36.004 --> 06:38.049
so help me or I tell him
how you took me to a club

06:38.136 --> 06:39.224
and got me wasted.

06:39.311 --> 06:41.009
Rumor has it that lady B's

06:41.096 --> 06:43.403
been outfoxed by a young fox.

06:43.490 --> 06:47.319
Got a credit card, fake ID,
and I want Bacardi and a boy.

06:47.407 --> 06:49.234
This body's
open for business.

06:49.321 --> 06:52.281
It seems only one ivory tower
is being stormed tonight.

06:56.241 --> 06:57.939
- 'You quit Eleanor's?'
- I had to. She was using me.

06:58.026 --> 06:59.375
Does dad know about it?
No, of course dad doesn't know.

06:59.462 --> 07:00.637
What am I saying?
You haven't been shipped off

07:00.724 --> 07:01.812
to a convent yet.

07:01.899 --> 07:03.466
Hey, Dan,
just take it easy.

07:03.553 --> 07:04.859
Nate, I'm sorry, but
this is none of your business.

07:04.946 --> 07:06.600
Dan, I promise I'll tell
dad everything tomorrow.

07:06.687 --> 07:09.124
I just.. I really need
tonight. I've worked so hard.

07:09.211 --> 07:10.604
For-for what?
What is this?

07:10.691 --> 07:14.303
Stop! We're putting on
a Guerilla fashion show.

07:14.390 --> 07:16.479
I don't know
what that means.

07:16.566 --> 07:18.960
Okay.
These dresses, I made them.

07:19.047 --> 07:21.136
And-and Agnes and her
friends are gonna model.

07:21.223 --> 07:22.920
Please, Dan.
Tonight's the one chance.

07:23.007 --> 07:24.444
I have to show
everyone what I can do.

07:26.707 --> 07:29.536
Ivan, I swear if that van's
not here in ten minutes

07:29.623 --> 07:32.843
you're not getting
those photos of me.

07:32.930 --> 07:34.671
Are we busted now or what?

07:36.107 --> 07:38.153
Dan, please.
I just need a few hours

07:38.240 --> 07:40.198
and then I'll tell
dad everything.

07:43.506 --> 07:45.856
Alright. I, uh,
I-I just need to think.

07:56.432 --> 07:58.390
[Blair]
'Well, you finally did it.'

07:58.478 --> 08:00.610
Made absolutely sure
I'm never gonna get into Yale.

08:00.697 --> 08:01.872
- What are you talking about?
- 'Little Emma.'

08:01.959 --> 08:03.613
Turns out
she's less Holly Hobbie.

08:03.700 --> 08:05.441
- And more Jenna Jameson.
- Can you speak plainly?

08:05.528 --> 08:08.096
She's determined to become a
woman on my watch

08:08.183 --> 08:09.663
'and if I don't help pimp
her out she's gonna'

08:09.750 --> 08:10.925
character assassinate
me to the Dean!

08:11.012 --> 08:11.969
I don't understand,
I thought she

08:12.056 --> 08:13.536
liked ice cream and magic.

08:13.623 --> 08:16.670
Next time leave
the scheming to the experts.

08:16.757 --> 08:19.281
- What are those?
- Pictures from camp Suisse.

08:19.368 --> 08:21.544
Aaron dressed up
as Cecil the caterpillar.

08:21.631 --> 08:23.372
'I bumped into him
outside the Palace.'

08:23.459 --> 08:26.462
The guy gave you a ring pop
when you were six. Move on.

08:26.549 --> 08:28.246
It was licorice,
and I was eight.

08:28.333 --> 08:31.641
Ancient, unimportant
history. Focus, Serena.

08:31.728 --> 08:33.338
You got me into this,
and I'm not losing Yale

08:33.425 --> 08:34.818
because of
that little tart's libido.

08:34.905 --> 08:36.603
Why don't you just
occupy her for a while?

08:36.690 --> 08:38.605
Take her to the charity gala.
When you get there

08:38.692 --> 08:40.345
'you can say you didn't know
how lame it would be.'

08:40.432 --> 08:42.783
Then it's time for her to
go home. You're off the hook.

08:42.870 --> 08:44.393
[Emma]
'So I checked
out Gossip girl'

08:44.480 --> 08:46.917
and I'm thinking we hit
Socialista before Beatrice.

08:49.354 --> 08:50.747
See what
I'm dealing with?

08:52.619 --> 08:55.709
Emma, I was thinking,
where is the glory

08:55.796 --> 08:58.842
in bedding down with
some dirty Manhattan hipster

08:58.929 --> 09:00.975
who's probably filming
you on the nanny cam?

09:01.062 --> 09:03.717
You really want
to make Muffy jealous?

09:03.804 --> 09:06.676
Have your flower plucked
by one of the elite.

09:06.763 --> 09:09.418
And where would I find
someone like that?

09:11.812 --> 09:13.509
Luckily, we know the place.

09:13.596 --> 09:17.078
But you're gonna have to pay
a visit to my closet first.

09:17.165 --> 09:19.210
[squeals]

09:19.297 --> 09:21.561
[laughs]

09:21.648 --> 09:22.779
Ooh.

09:28.176 --> 09:30.961
Sorry. Thing about a cafe,
people weirdly want service.

09:31.048 --> 09:32.484
Come on, V, what,
what am I gonna do?

09:32.572 --> 09:33.616
You gotta give me
something here.

09:33.703 --> 09:35.009
She's telling
your dad tomorrow

09:35.096 --> 09:37.098
and whatever this whole
fashion show thing is

09:37.185 --> 09:38.621
it sounds like she put
a lot of work into it.

09:38.708 --> 09:41.755
We-we all just cover
for her? You, me, Nate?

09:41.842 --> 09:44.758
Right. Don't lump me with
Nate. He's your friend.

09:44.845 --> 09:46.629
Are-are we ever gonna
talk about this?

09:46.716 --> 09:48.718
'Cause he was living there with
no electricity, no funriture--

09:48.805 --> 09:49.980
You did the right thing.

09:50.067 --> 09:51.547
Which is why you
haven't been to the loft

09:51.634 --> 09:53.680
since he moved in.

09:53.767 --> 09:56.639
Just tell me. Do you still
have feelings for him?

09:56.726 --> 09:58.946
- Nate hates me.
- That's not what I asked.

09:59.033 --> 10:01.731
Nate and I tried.
It didn't work. End of story.

10:01.818 --> 10:03.646
I'm just saying,
if you like him

10:03.733 --> 10:06.475
you should tell him,
'cause Nate is a good guy.

10:06.562 --> 10:08.651
It's funny how you're ready
to condemn your sister

10:08.738 --> 10:11.001
but Nate, who's done some
pretty questionable things

10:11.088 --> 10:12.437
gets a free pass.

10:12.524 --> 10:13.787
- I get she lied--
- No. No.

10:13.874 --> 10:15.266
- It's not about the lying.
- Oh.

10:15.353 --> 10:17.181
I-I don't want her
to get in trouble 'cause..

10:17.268 --> 10:19.227
...what if she's about to make
a huge, life altering mistake

10:19.314 --> 10:20.576
and I don't stop her?

10:20.663 --> 10:22.273
Who was about to
make a huge mistake?

10:29.585 --> 10:32.327
'Well, what do we have here?'

10:32.414 --> 10:34.285
Allow me
to introduce myself.

10:36.418 --> 10:37.941
- I'm Chuck.
- Bass.

10:38.028 --> 10:40.117
Oh, my God. I read
about you on Gossip Girl.

10:40.204 --> 10:42.032
You're-you're
like the devil.

10:42.119 --> 10:45.383
Finally some truth in
advertising. Headed out, are we?

10:45.470 --> 10:48.822
Serena, Blair and I are going to
the gala. Hope you're coming?

10:48.909 --> 10:50.737
Well, I'm all for company
on a Saturday night

10:50.824 --> 10:53.740
but the only thing I like
that aged is my scotch.

10:53.827 --> 10:56.220
What? It's old people?

10:56.307 --> 10:57.961
Blair told me
it was all hot guys.

10:58.048 --> 11:01.443
Sounds to me like you're
being taken for a ride.

11:01.530 --> 11:06.230
Well, how about you take
me for a ride instead?

11:06.317 --> 11:08.711
Uh, Buckman..

11:08.798 --> 11:10.670
...could you
pass this to Ms. Serena?

11:10.757 --> 11:11.975
It was with the concierge.

11:16.588 --> 11:18.852
Looks like you've just
hooked yourself a bass.

11:21.768 --> 11:23.247
You look beautiful.
Can we go now?

11:23.334 --> 11:24.945
Patience, love.

11:25.032 --> 11:27.904
The sooner we get there,
the sooner the jig is up.

11:27.991 --> 11:31.125
I'll go check
on the vestal virgin.

11:31.212 --> 11:32.648
Left at the concierge, miss.

11:32.735 --> 11:33.867
Thank you.

11:40.917 --> 11:43.528
- Well-played, Cecil.
- She's gone!

11:43.615 --> 11:45.879
- Who?
- Who do you think? Emma!

11:45.966 --> 11:47.489
Jenny, you should wait for Dan.

11:47.576 --> 11:49.839
No, there's no time.
This is my one chance

11:49.926 --> 11:51.493
I have to prove that
I can be a designer.

11:51.580 --> 11:53.277
Otherwise it's back to
being little J at Constance

11:53.364 --> 11:55.671
except worse this time, because
everyone's gonna know I failed.

11:55.758 --> 11:57.455
And since when
are you so worried?

11:57.542 --> 12:00.458
You haven't spoken
two words to me all week.

12:00.545 --> 12:03.635
Whoa, whoa, whoa, careful, guys!
Those are couture!

12:03.723 --> 12:05.463
Now, why do you keep
eating those pot brownies, man?

12:05.550 --> 12:07.117
You know sugar
makes you spaz.

12:07.204 --> 12:10.468
Jenny, come on. I mean,
you know it's complicated.

12:10.555 --> 12:13.515
Do you care about me?
Prove it.

12:13.602 --> 12:16.561
Come with me.

12:16.648 --> 12:18.041
Maybe I should drive.

12:22.872 --> 12:25.832
Okay, guys, come on!
This train wagon is on the move!

12:27.398 --> 12:28.312
Is that Nate?

12:28.399 --> 12:31.620
Hey! Hey, stop!

12:31.707 --> 12:33.491
Stop!

12:33.578 --> 12:35.493
Wow. A real limo.

12:35.580 --> 12:37.278
This is so perfect.

12:37.365 --> 12:38.540
Uh, by the way,
my name is--

12:38.627 --> 12:42.109
No, let's not ruin it
with you talking.

12:42.196 --> 12:43.414
Fine.

12:43.501 --> 12:45.808
Spotted,
bass taking the bait..

12:45.895 --> 12:47.418
Straight to
business then.

12:47.505 --> 12:48.724
...jailbait, that is.

12:52.467 --> 12:53.990
- 'Text him.'
- 'I've texted him six times.'

12:54.077 --> 12:55.905
Well, text him again,
before he screws that girl

12:55.992 --> 12:57.689
and any other chance that
I had of getting into Yale!

12:57.777 --> 12:59.213
I put out an APB
on Gossip Girl

12:59.300 --> 13:00.649
with Emma's
Facebook picture on it.

13:00.736 --> 13:02.259
'Every girl in Manhattan
will be on the lookout.'

13:02.346 --> 13:03.521
Chuck!

13:03.608 --> 13:06.698
You! What did you
do with her?

13:06.786 --> 13:10.398
Hey! She assaulted me,
demanded I deflower her--

13:10.485 --> 13:12.966
Oh, limos and virgins,
your specialty.

13:13.053 --> 13:15.490
Just so you know,
while there are few things

13:15.577 --> 13:19.276
I consider sacred, the back
of the limo isone of them.

13:19.363 --> 13:20.495
When she realized
she couldn't ride this

13:20.582 --> 13:21.670
thoroughbred she bolted.

13:21.757 --> 13:22.889
Last time I saw her,
she was heading

13:22.976 --> 13:23.933
in a cab downtown.

13:24.020 --> 13:25.282
'Hey, Iz just texted me.'

13:25.369 --> 13:26.936
She said the bartender
at 1 Oak said

13:27.023 --> 13:28.764
E. Boardman just used
her credit card there.

13:28.851 --> 13:30.026
She didn't waste
any time. Come on.

13:30.113 --> 13:31.375
I can't go.
I have my mom's thing.

13:31.462 --> 13:32.812
What? No!

13:32.899 --> 13:36.076
You're coming.
You owe me, both of you!

13:36.163 --> 13:37.294
Come on!

13:40.384 --> 13:42.734
[camera shutters clicking]

13:42.822 --> 13:44.736
[indistinct chatter]

13:49.437 --> 13:51.265
Jenny, what are we doing
here at the Palace?

13:51.352 --> 13:52.614
This is the New York
Philanthropic

13:52.701 --> 13:54.224
Society's annual gala.

13:54.311 --> 13:56.183
- I know.
- I'm no fashion expert.

13:56.270 --> 13:58.533
But shouldn't the people
seeing your show be, like

13:58.620 --> 14:00.840
not friends with my mom?

14:00.927 --> 14:02.406
We're looking
for financial backers.

14:02.493 --> 14:03.755
Everyone is gonna
be here tonight

14:03.843 --> 14:07.368
fortune 500 CEOs,
lVMH, PPR, Hearst.

14:07.455 --> 14:10.937
We're looking for people
with money who can get us press.

14:11.024 --> 14:12.808
Well, looks like you've
done your homework, but--

14:12.895 --> 14:16.203
I have. Sometimes the ends
have to justify the means.

14:16.290 --> 14:18.074
Here.

14:18.161 --> 14:20.729
I pulled you a suit
on the way out.

14:20.816 --> 14:23.079
It would really mean a lot
to me if you stayed.

14:33.916 --> 14:36.832
[instrumental music]

14:38.878 --> 14:40.270
I don't see her.

14:40.357 --> 14:41.663
I'll talk
to the bartender.

14:43.491 --> 14:46.015
You have to admit,
the licorice ring was sweet.

14:46.102 --> 14:48.017
Look, even if you're
just being literal

14:48.104 --> 14:49.801
I don't wanna hear another
word about your albatross

14:49.889 --> 14:51.803
until we find mine.

14:51.891 --> 14:53.153
I'm looking for a girl.

14:58.419 --> 14:59.550
There she is.

15:02.684 --> 15:03.859
Oh, my God.

15:05.165 --> 15:06.296
Look.

15:11.040 --> 15:13.347
Looks like you got nailed,
just not in the way you wanted.

15:13.434 --> 15:15.175
Give me time,
Serge and I were just

15:15.262 --> 15:16.654
moving the party
over to his place--

15:16.741 --> 15:19.222
"Serge?" Honestly,
how tacky are you?

15:19.309 --> 15:20.832
Okay, you guys,
let's go. Come on.

15:20.920 --> 15:22.573
Serena!

15:22.660 --> 15:24.619
- Hey, you should have called.
- Scott, hey.

15:24.706 --> 15:25.620
Don't worry.
I have a table for you.

15:25.707 --> 15:27.578
Wait! Wait! No!

15:27.665 --> 15:29.537
Go! Get out of my..

15:29.624 --> 15:30.625
Stop her!

15:30.712 --> 15:32.496
'Emma!'

15:32.583 --> 15:34.585
Excu.. Ew!

15:36.370 --> 15:39.155
[classical music playing]

15:52.342 --> 15:54.692
Oh, my God.

15:54.779 --> 15:56.868
Excuse me, miss.
Can I have your name, please?

15:56.956 --> 16:01.961
Uh, yeah, it's Erica.
Erica Van Der Woodsen.

16:02.048 --> 16:04.441
Sometimes they leave
off the A. My..

16:04.528 --> 16:06.487
My parents are
the, uh, the guests of honor.

16:06.574 --> 16:08.619
Oh. Okay, thanks.

16:08.706 --> 16:09.881
Yeah.

16:11.666 --> 16:12.841
What am I doin'?

16:14.886 --> 16:17.411
Jenny?

16:17.498 --> 16:20.240
Hi, Mrs. Bass.

16:20.327 --> 16:21.458
Um..

16:23.678 --> 16:25.723
Congratulations.

16:25.810 --> 16:28.204
I didn't, uh, I didn't know
you were receiving an award.

16:28.291 --> 16:30.032
It's really..

16:30.119 --> 16:32.252
Uh, really..
It's really great.

16:32.339 --> 16:34.428
Well, thank you, um..
Honestly, I hate being

16:34.515 --> 16:36.734
the center
of attention but, um..

16:36.821 --> 16:38.258
So, um, who are
you here with?

16:38.345 --> 16:41.391
- Oh, well, uh.. gee, uh--
- She's with me.

16:41.478 --> 16:42.566
Oh!

16:42.653 --> 16:44.264
My mom
couldn't make it, and, um..

16:44.351 --> 16:46.396
...she asked me to fill in,
so I invited Jenny.

16:46.483 --> 16:49.747
Oh, that is so sweet.
Have you seen Serena?

16:49.834 --> 16:51.749
No, I haven't, actually.
I'm sorry.

16:51.836 --> 16:53.012
Okay.

16:53.099 --> 16:54.056
Do you want to get
something to drink?

16:54.143 --> 16:55.536
Yeah,
that'd be great.

16:55.623 --> 16:58.017
Excuse us.

16:58.104 --> 16:59.888
Oh, my God,
you're shaking.

16:59.975 --> 17:01.977
Yeah, I didn't-I didn't
know that Lily and Bart

17:02.064 --> 17:04.110
were getting an award,
and I'm about to ruin the night

17:04.197 --> 17:06.416
of-of people who've only
ever been nice to me, Nate.

17:06.503 --> 17:08.331
Just forget about it. You don't
have to go through with it.

17:08.418 --> 17:09.854
- There are other ways.
- No.

17:09.941 --> 17:11.204
Have you not heard
anything I've said, Nate?

17:11.291 --> 17:12.857
This is it.
Tonight's all I have.

17:12.944 --> 17:14.033
Nate, I don't even know..

17:24.347 --> 17:25.479
[camera shutter clicking]

17:29.744 --> 17:31.659
You kissed me again.

17:31.746 --> 17:33.313
I know.

17:33.400 --> 17:37.012
So...does that mean
you don't regret last week?

17:37.099 --> 17:39.536
I guess not.

17:39.623 --> 17:43.758
Jenny, whatever you
decide, I'm with you.

17:43.845 --> 17:45.020
Okay.

17:47.805 --> 17:50.156
[instrumental music]

17:51.244 --> 17:53.637
[upbeat music]

17:56.118 --> 17:57.728
Move!

17:57.815 --> 18:00.340
I lost her out front in
the crowd of identical couples.

18:00.427 --> 18:02.124
Their cab is probably
halfway to Serge's by now

18:02.211 --> 18:03.169
if she even waits that long.

18:03.256 --> 18:04.431
She's not
answering her phone.

18:04.518 --> 18:06.041
Well, congratulations, S

18:06.128 --> 18:07.738
for ruining my future again.

18:07.825 --> 18:09.044
- Me?
- I'm sorry.

18:09.131 --> 18:10.306
Who came up with
the idea of me

18:10.393 --> 18:11.655
babysitting my way
into Yale?

18:11.742 --> 18:13.179
You wouldn't have
had another chance

18:13.266 --> 18:14.267
with the dean if it
hadn't been for me.

18:14.354 --> 18:16.443
Oh, right,
you're such a celebrity.

18:16.530 --> 18:18.575
"Ms. Van Der Woodsen,
your pillows are being fluffed

18:18.662 --> 18:20.099
in the VIP section."

18:20.186 --> 18:21.883

she's in the corner booth.

'And that's
nother father.'

18:41.729 --> 18:43.557

This is Stewart.
He's in love with me.

19:03.925 --> 19:07.929
Uh, isn't he gonna
get fired for this?

19:08.016 --> 19:09.409
Yeah, well, he was
gonna quit anyway

19:09.496 --> 19:11.498

a professional gamer.

19:11.585 --> 19:14.370

to my friend.

come to me sooner..

she is, we don't even know--

I'm sorry--

- Did you try Nate?

about little sister

We're gonna find her, alright?

20:09.817 --> 20:11.384
At least she's with Nate.
He'll watch out for her.

20:11.471 --> 20:12.689
'He couldn't have known
about this, right?'

20:12.776 --> 20:14.213
I-I gotta think Nate
would've said something.

20:14.300 --> 20:16.606
Don't be so sure.

20:16.693 --> 20:18.347
Nate didn't know. He would
never keep that from us--

We don't know
what Nate would do, Vanessa.

Hi-his morals are
questionable at best.

20:23.787 --> 20:25.702
Well, who-who would've thought
that he'd date both you

20:25.789 --> 20:28.096

and by "date," I mean--

- 'What's he talkin' about?'
- Nothin'.

Nate's a good guy"?

You're saying you do like him?

he's not a good guy?

Alright I'm-I'm gonna

- Rufus.
- Bart, hello.

21:35.772 --> 21:37.731
I need to find my daughter

21:37.818 --> 21:40.342
so if you see her,
hold onto her, would you?

21:40.429 --> 21:42.475
Huh.

21:42.562 --> 21:44.128
Congratulations.

21:49.656 --> 21:53.486

This poor little girl's

Oh, my God. Vanessa!

Vanessa, wait!

29:08.137 --> 29:09.748
Here, here, here, Jenny, Jenny.
Stop. No, just..

29:09.835 --> 29:12.098
- It's not your place.
- No, I have to say something.

29:12.185 --> 29:14.056
Stop. I shouldn't
have done that. I'm sorry.

29:14.143 --> 29:15.841
- Jenny.
- Vanessa!

Looks like it's bros before

when her loyalty kicked in

Backers are welcome...whoa.

29:32.640 --> 29:35.599
Get your gropey hands
off of me, creep.

29:35.686 --> 29:37.036
I cannot believe your sister.

29:37.123 --> 29:38.515
She's taken it
to a whole other level.

29:38.602 --> 29:40.256
Yeah, yeah, she has.

29:40.343 --> 29:42.215
She's gotta be around here
somewhere.

29:42.302 --> 29:43.433
I'll check the lobby.

29:50.005 --> 29:52.007
You might be upset,
but the truth is

29:52.094 --> 29:53.704
this wasn't how you wanted
to lose your virginity.

29:53.792 --> 29:57.317
And which venue
would you suggest, perhaps?

30:00.973 --> 30:01.887
'Miss.'

30:03.845 --> 30:05.804
Chuck, I know it wasn't easy

30:05.891 --> 30:09.198
getting "Gossip Girl"
to post that bogus report.

30:09.285 --> 30:12.723
- Thank you.
- For you, anytime.

30:12.811 --> 30:14.595
I think your little virgin's
making a break for it.

30:15.161 --> 30:16.118
Ugh!

30:19.078 --> 30:21.863
Emma. Emma, Emma, wait.

30:21.950 --> 30:24.213
Aren't you done?
You won.

30:24.300 --> 30:27.347
You, Muffy, my mom.
I'm the only loser.

30:27.434 --> 30:29.436
You still don't get it.

30:29.523 --> 30:31.220
Having sex for the first time
shouldn't be

30:31.307 --> 30:34.049
part of a competition to beat
Muffy the lacross-titute.

30:34.136 --> 30:36.617
It should be with someone
you love.

30:38.314 --> 30:40.142
Was your first time
with someone you love?

30:42.362 --> 30:45.104
Yes. It was.

30:45.191 --> 30:47.019
And honestly..

30:47.106 --> 30:48.977
...there are better ways of
getting your mother's attention.

30:49.064 --> 30:51.197
- I told you, it's about Muffy.
- Please.

30:51.284 --> 30:55.897
I wrote the book on distracted,
self-centered mothers.

30:55.984 --> 30:58.421
My mom has never met
a single one of my teachers.

30:58.508 --> 30:59.945
She regularly forgets
my birthday

31:00.032 --> 31:01.555
and she only comments
on my appearance

31:01.642 --> 31:04.601
when she has something
to criticize.

31:04.688 --> 31:06.212
But you're perfect.

31:06.299 --> 31:09.476
True, and that's why
I finally realized

31:09.563 --> 31:11.957
it wasn't about me.

31:12.044 --> 31:13.393
The same way
it's not about you.

31:15.961 --> 31:17.745
My mom always says
when we come to the city

31:17.832 --> 31:21.836
we're gonna hang out and do
mother-daughter things.

31:21.923 --> 31:23.533
It never happens.

31:23.620 --> 31:25.013
So tell her that.

31:27.320 --> 31:31.454
And...can you try to avoid
the Serges of the world?

31:31.541 --> 31:33.239
Thanks, by the way.

31:33.326 --> 31:34.980
- That guy was pretty gross.
- Yeah.

[cell phone rings]

31:39.549 --> 31:42.988
Uh...hello?

31:43.075 --> 31:46.513
Hey, Jordan. Uh, no, no.
No, no, it's not too late.

31:46.600 --> 31:51.953
Uh, yeah. I-I saw that.
The three professors. That's..

31:54.521 --> 31:57.480
No, I-I know what anemic means.

31:57.567 --> 31:59.787
Uh, alright, well, thank you.
Thank you for trying.

31:59.874 --> 32:03.008
I appreciate it. Okay.

32:03.095 --> 32:05.793
Hey.

32:05.880 --> 32:07.926
Is everything okay?

32:08.013 --> 32:11.277
Um...no.
No, not really.

32:11.364 --> 32:13.279
No, don't...
don't worry about Jenny.

32:13.366 --> 32:14.584
She'll probably
get in some trouble

32:14.671 --> 32:16.064
for disrupting the event,
but honestly

32:16.151 --> 32:18.458
I think everyone in there
was kind of relieved.

32:18.545 --> 32:20.199
No, I know.
Jenny will be fine.

32:20.286 --> 32:22.679
Jenny will be great,
because Jenny always does

32:22.766 --> 32:24.290
what she has to do to get
what she wants.

32:27.336 --> 32:28.990
I don't follow.

32:29.077 --> 32:33.038
Tonight my sister alienated
everyone in her life.

32:33.125 --> 32:34.953
But tomorrow she's gonna be
in "The New York Times."

32:35.040 --> 32:36.824
I just can't help but wonder

32:36.911 --> 32:40.219
if she's the one with
all the guts in the family.

32:40.306 --> 32:42.525
Hey,
where is this coming from?

32:44.745 --> 32:46.312
Nowhere. Nowhere.
I'm sorry.

32:46.399 --> 32:47.661
The Humphreys already
spoiled your mom's night.

32:47.748 --> 32:49.358
I don't wanna spoil yours,
too.

32:49.445 --> 32:52.057
No, I don't care about
this night. I care about you.

32:52.144 --> 32:53.275
Tell me what's wrong.

32:55.495 --> 32:59.107
Uh...I'm not gonna get
into Yale

32:59.194 --> 33:01.501
or probably any other school
with a decent writing program.

33:01.588 --> 33:05.287
- No, Dan, that is not true.
- No. I gotta go find my dad.

33:05.374 --> 33:07.594
Thank you.

33:07.681 --> 33:08.812
Goodnight.

33:17.430 --> 33:19.171
'Do you realize
what time it is?'

33:19.258 --> 33:21.521
And look at that dress.

33:21.608 --> 33:25.133
You expect me to believe
you went to the movies in that?

33:25.220 --> 33:26.308
Mom, please don't.

33:26.395 --> 33:29.746
- This isn't her fault.
- Bed...now.

'Bed!'

Mrs. Boardman, before you say
anything you'll regret--

33:36.927 --> 33:38.842
What was your plan...
take my daughter clubbing

33:38.929 --> 33:40.714
and hope she'd plead
your case to the dean?

33:40.801 --> 33:43.499
I have some bad news
for you, Miss Waldorf.

33:43.586 --> 33:46.720
From what I've seen,
you're not Yale material.

33:48.243 --> 33:50.158
Oh, you haven't
seen anything yet.

33:50.245 --> 33:51.594
Tell me,
did you have a nice time

33:51.681 --> 33:52.639
with your Bryn Mawr friends?

33:52.726 --> 33:54.075
What is that supposed to mean?

33:54.162 --> 33:55.729
Here.
Let me lend you my phone.

to make a call to New Haven.

Mom, this isn't Blair's fault.

33:58.645 --> 33:59.820

trying to help me.

34:01.430 --> 34:02.736
'You're lecturing me?'

No wonder I don't want to spend
time with you.

Just..

34:22.016 --> 34:25.193
...your daughter
is a great girl.

34:25.280 --> 34:29.197
You should pay
more attention to her.

Soon it'll be too late.

34:41.862 --> 34:43.168
Excuse me, ma'am?

Um, did you see
a girl come out?

34:44.821 --> 34:46.301
She had a blue shirt
and dark, curly hair?

34:46.388 --> 34:48.999
- Jenny.
- Dad? Dad, let go of me.

34:49.087 --> 34:50.827
Let go of me, dad.
I'm trying to find Vanessa.

34:53.656 --> 34:55.136
You know what? I am.

34:55.223 --> 34:57.138
Because honestly, I achieved
everything that I wanted.

34:57.225 --> 34:58.792
Jenny, you can't
just go through life

34:58.879 --> 35:00.533
not caring
about who you hurt.

35:00.620 --> 35:03.536
Dad, I already have 32
missed calls on my phone, okay?

35:03.623 --> 35:05.973
And those people aren't calling
to tell me how mad they are

35:06.060 --> 35:07.844
that I ruined their party.
They're calling to tell me

35:07.931 --> 35:09.585
that they like my designs,
and they want to meet me.

35:09.672 --> 35:11.239
Well, those people
are not your father

35:11.326 --> 35:14.503
and speaking for him, I have
never been more disappointed.

35:14.590 --> 35:18.420
Hi. Hi there. I hope I'm not
interrupting anything.

35:18.507 --> 35:20.422
Jenny, I think you owe
Lily an apology.

35:20.509 --> 35:22.511
- No, really.
- No, no, no. He's right.

35:22.598 --> 35:25.035
Lily, I'm...I'm really sorry.

35:25.123 --> 35:27.734
Well, honestly, it wasn't
the evening I expected

35:27.821 --> 35:30.215
but...it was amazing.

'The whole thing
was inspired.'

35:35.045 --> 35:36.699
Um..

35:36.786 --> 35:38.658
Okay, I'm just gonna wait
over here for a moment.

35:38.745 --> 35:40.138
If you think you're getting
away with this tonight

35:40.225 --> 35:41.791
you are dead wrong.

35:41.878 --> 35:43.445
It's too late. It's done.

35:46.056 --> 35:47.536
Yeah, you're right. Officer.

35:47.623 --> 35:48.842
If you're looking
for the person responsible

35:48.929 --> 35:50.017
for tonight, this is her.

35:50.104 --> 35:51.192
- Dad!
- 'Rufus.'

35:53.760 --> 35:54.978
You can't be serious.

35:55.065 --> 35:56.719
You're giving me no choice.

35:56.806 --> 35:59.200
It's her number
all over the Polaroids.

36:02.856 --> 36:05.554
Miss, I'm gonna have
to take you to the station.

36:05.641 --> 36:07.774
We'll call your parents
from there.

the one getting me arrested!

and my husband'

won't be pressing any charges.

Makes my job easier.

36:22.963 --> 36:24.486
Lily, this is none
of your business.

36:24.573 --> 36:28.229
I am saving you from
making a terrible...mistake.

36:29.622 --> 36:31.189
You know what?

36:31.276 --> 36:34.583
You guys figure it out.
I'm going home.

Poor Jenny...all that glamour
almost led to the slammer.

36:38.370 --> 36:39.980
But what will
the morning bring?

36:46.639 --> 36:50.817
Figured you'd be back
at the family manor.

36:50.904 --> 36:52.384
Is this the new minimalism?

36:55.952 --> 36:57.302
What the hell is going on?

36:57.389 --> 36:59.782
What do you think?
I told you we were in trouble.

36:59.869 --> 37:01.219
You didn't tell me
it was this bad.

37:02.829 --> 37:03.743
Then again, if it drove you to
Brooklyn

37:03.830 --> 37:05.135
I guess I should have known.

37:05.223 --> 37:07.181
Brooklyn's over. I'm going
to stay with my mom.

37:07.268 --> 37:08.574
Don't be so dramatic.
You're coming with me.

37:08.661 --> 37:10.445
No. I'm not.

B, it's time to get up.

37:19.280 --> 37:22.022
There are other schools
besides Yale...like Princeton.

37:22.109 --> 37:25.243
Princeton is a trade school.
There's only Yale.

37:27.332 --> 37:28.985
Well, I'm proud of you
for not succumbing

37:29.072 --> 37:30.726
to your baser instincts.

37:30.813 --> 37:32.946
Hey, even though you
might not get into Yale

37:33.033 --> 37:34.861

you won't go to hell.

Yes.

37:52.487 --> 37:54.968
Uh-huh.

37:57.710 --> 37:59.668
Hey.

37:59.755 --> 38:03.672
So, uh, I was thinking you, me,
assorted breakfast pastries.

38:03.759 --> 38:05.892
How many pastries, exactly?

38:05.979 --> 38:09.417
Is it just you and me, or is
the entire harem coming along?

38:09.504 --> 38:11.376
Yeah, I want
to explain yesterday.

38:11.463 --> 38:14.422
Look, Aaron, the rings were
sweet but I thought about it

38:14.509 --> 38:19.253
and I don't really want to date
someone who has...a posse.

38:19.340 --> 38:20.428
- A posse?
- Well.

38:20.515 --> 38:21.603
In our last
two encounters

38:21.690 --> 38:22.648
you've been with
two different girls.

38:22.735 --> 38:23.910
Well, one...one was a friend.

38:23.997 --> 38:25.564
So you've said.

38:25.651 --> 38:27.957
And the other one was..

38:30.569 --> 38:32.135
You know what?

38:32.222 --> 38:34.312
No, I-I could explain
who Tamara is

38:34.399 --> 38:36.792
and why she was
at my apartment last night.

38:36.879 --> 38:39.665
The fact is, either you feel
something here or you don't.

38:39.752 --> 38:42.885
If you want an excuse not to
give this a shot, that's fine.

38:42.972 --> 38:44.496
But ever since you walked
into the gallery last week

38:44.583 --> 38:46.149
I haven't been able to stop
thinking about you.

38:47.760 --> 38:49.501
I even dug up
my old camp stuff.

38:50.980 --> 38:52.068
So did I.

38:52.155 --> 38:53.374
Is it too weird to think
that maybe

38:53.461 --> 38:56.246
fate brought us
back together again?

38:56.334 --> 38:57.378
Yes.

38:58.727 --> 39:00.599
But romantic, too.

39:04.254 --> 39:05.908
Hey, you know what?
Forget breakfast.

39:05.995 --> 39:08.084
I've waited nine years.
I think that merits dinner.

39:08.171 --> 39:09.782
You didn't eat that ring,
did you?

39:09.869 --> 39:10.826
No, not yet.

Good. It's nine years old.

39:15.135 --> 39:17.093
Wait. You kept yours?

39:17.180 --> 39:18.660
I'll see you tonight.

39:18.747 --> 39:20.793
[laughs]
Ah!

39:20.880 --> 39:23.839
Oh, my God. Emma told the Dean
that I'm the one person

39:23.926 --> 39:25.928
living or dead that she'd
most like to have dinner with.

39:26.015 --> 39:27.060
Oh, B!

39:27.147 --> 39:28.453
And he said that Yale

39:28.540 --> 39:30.542
could really use a girl
like Blair Waldorf.

39:30.629 --> 39:32.239
Oh, B,
I'm so happy for you.

39:32.326 --> 39:34.633
[camera shutter clicking]

39:38.767 --> 39:40.378
'Hey, I was just
about to wake you.'

39:40.465 --> 39:41.814
Hmm.

39:41.901 --> 39:43.598
Your, uh, sister
stomped out of here

39:43.685 --> 39:46.079
at about 6:00 this morning,
so it's just the two of us.

39:46.166 --> 39:47.602
Did you sleep
in that last night?

39:47.689 --> 39:48.821
I didn't sleep, actually.
I was up all night

39:48.908 --> 39:50.518
finishing this story
for Noah Shapiro.

39:51.998 --> 39:54.217
The guy from "The Paris Review"?
Which story?

39:54.304 --> 39:55.436
The one about Chuck Bass.

39:58.918 --> 40:00.267
You said you couldn't
write that story.

40:00.354 --> 40:02.748
No, I could always write it.
I chose not to.

40:02.835 --> 40:04.271
Dan, just because Jenny--

40:04.358 --> 40:06.926
Dad, look, the morning after
my little sister stages

40:07.013 --> 40:09.319
a fashion show
that all of New York City

40:09.407 --> 40:10.973
will be talking about
is not the time

40:11.060 --> 40:13.019
for the "slow and steady"
speech.

40:13.106 --> 40:16.849
Alright, I'm sorry.
I-I tried it your way.

40:16.936 --> 40:18.807
I wish I could get
the two of you to understand

40:18.894 --> 40:22.768
that success, people
praising you, it goes away.

40:22.855 --> 40:25.161
And when that day comes

40:25.248 --> 40:26.859
if you don't like
who you are, you're done.

40:28.643 --> 40:30.602
Well, I guess that's a chance
I'm willing to take.

40:30.689 --> 40:34.562
Dan, please.
I have to worry about you now?

40:34.649 --> 40:36.956
It's gonna be all I can do
to try and reach Jenny.

40:38.827 --> 40:40.481
It's a little late
for that, dad.

40:40.568 --> 40:42.701
I-I think you need
to look in her room.
