02:57.219 --> 02:59.179
Acting Chancellor Heusmann,

02:59.221 --> 03:00.639
you are under arrest
for high treason

03:00.681 --> 03:02.391
and the murder of our Fuhrer,
Adolf Hitler.

07:55.601 --> 07:57.186
A heart of steel.

09:21.228 --> 09:26.692
Gentlemen, the world is
once more in balance.

09:40.038 --> 09:42.332
Trade Minister?

09:42.374 --> 09:44.876
Admiral, we deceive ourselves
if we believe

09:44.918 --> 09:46.753
we have achieved parity
with the Nazis.

09:46.795 --> 09:51.008
In time we will have more.

09:51.049 --> 09:52.634
Respectfully, Admiral.

09:52.676 --> 09:55.595
An arms race with the Reich...

09:55.637 --> 09:57.514
will bankrupt us.

09:59.266 --> 10:01.852
What choice do we have?

19:20.368 --> 19:22.912
Good. Good.

19:22.954 --> 19:24.122
Very good.

19:25.957 --> 19:27.667
Progress.

22:40.985 --> 22:44.322
You know what you must do.

23:07.428 --> 23:09.388
Do what you need to do...

23:10.765 --> 23:12.308
...my son.

23:23.152 --> 23:26.489
A heart of steel.

33:57.911 --> 33:59.121
And Japanese?

33:59.163 --> 34:00.789
My Japanese is serviceable, sir.

34:03.876 --> 34:05.169
Again.
