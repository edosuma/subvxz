WEBVTT

00:01.698 --> 00:03.698
Are you still worried
about the risk?

00:03.949 --> 00:06.509
Because I've written to my aunt
in Sydney, and she'll help us.

00:06.519 --> 00:08.629
Marry me.
I will.

00:08.639 --> 00:10.739
I will marry you.

00:10.749 --> 00:13.664
This isn't about the church.
I'm your child.

00:13.674 --> 00:16.589
Take your Jew name and go.
I have no daughter.

00:16.599 --> 00:18.459
Go!

00:18.469 --> 00:22.389
I never want to be reminded
of that hypocritical day

00:22.399 --> 00:24.499
I married the man
who loves my brother.

00:24.509 --> 00:28.869
And I will respect the need
to keep this between we three.

00:28.879 --> 00:32.189
But I will never respect you again.

00:42.149 --> 00:44.149
Did you hear
the early morning news, George?

00:44.159 --> 00:45.819
No, I didn't.

00:45.829 --> 00:48.069
They've delayed
the atomic test at Emu Field.

00:48.079 --> 00:50.139
Did they say why?

00:50.149 --> 00:52.469
Something to do with the direction
of the prevailing winds.

00:56.309 --> 00:57.909
I trust you slept well, dear?

00:59.749 --> 01:02.429
Yes, thank you.
Mm-hm. Rest and relaxation.

01:02.439 --> 01:04.468
Quite the tonic.

01:04.479 --> 01:06.509
James?
Yes.

01:06.519 --> 01:07.549
Good.

01:09.789 --> 01:12.069
Does no-one else
see a problem here?

01:12.079 --> 01:13.939
They're not letting off a bomb

01:13.949 --> 01:15.659
because they're worried
that the wind

01:15.669 --> 01:17.589
will blow the radiation
over populated areas.

01:17.599 --> 01:19.309
Should they be letting it off
at all?

01:19.319 --> 01:20.779
- It's important we test.
- Why?

01:20.789 --> 01:23.184
The atom bomb saved a lot of lives
by ending the war.

01:23.194 --> 01:25.589
And how many more lives
will it take in the future?

01:25.599 --> 01:27.219
Plenty, if the Russians use it.

01:27.229 --> 01:29.229
So we let the British test
their bombs here?

01:29.239 --> 01:30.819
Rule Britannia.

01:30.829 --> 01:33.349
And long may it rule.

01:34.589 --> 01:37.869
George was something of a red-ragger
himself at Anna's age.

01:37.879 --> 01:39.499
I was not.

01:39.509 --> 01:41.749
Certainly a lot less conservative
than you are now.

01:43.749 --> 01:46.949
I hate to think what you'll be saying
after a few days with your aunt.

01:47.054 --> 01:49.694
I'm sure Carolyn will be far too
busy taking you to 'South Pacific'

01:49.704 --> 01:51.324
to talk politics.

01:51.334 --> 01:54.324
A musical play about
a French planter

01:54.334 --> 01:56.949
who has half-caste children
to a native woman

01:56.959 --> 01:59.574
and now wants to marry
a nice white girl?

01:59.584 --> 02:02.574
I'd say that was political in itself.

02:05.654 --> 02:07.934
I'd like to come
to the city with you.

02:07.944 --> 02:10.484
When?
Today.

02:10.494 --> 02:14.654
The long journey back and forth -
you have a baby to think of.

02:14.664 --> 02:17.894
And Aunt Carolyn only has
the one extra room.

02:17.904 --> 02:20.174
You two could
bunk in together.

02:20.184 --> 02:21.854
If you want to go, you go.

02:21.889 --> 02:23.409
James, you don't mind, do you?

02:24.409 --> 02:25.599
No.

02:25.609 --> 02:27.889
Settled. The break will do you good.
George...

02:29.089 --> 02:30.369
Yes.

02:43.249 --> 02:44.769
I thought you left already.

02:44.779 --> 02:46.489
Soon.

02:47.449 --> 02:49.769
Olivia's decided to come.

02:49.779 --> 02:50.799
Oh!

02:50.809 --> 02:52.319
The whole reason for going

02:52.329 --> 02:54.609
is to ask Aunt Carolyn
about precautions.

02:54.619 --> 02:56.969
How can I do that with her there?

02:56.979 --> 02:58.889
It should be up to me.
No.

03:00.169 --> 03:01.679
The man should do it.

03:01.689 --> 03:04.689
If you go into a chemist asking,
it'll be all around town.

03:04.699 --> 03:07.889
And who have you been seen with?

03:09.009 --> 03:11.049
Might as well hand Doris Collins
a loudhailer.

03:11.059 --> 03:13.319
It'll be worse if Olivia finds out.

03:13.329 --> 03:16.529
I'll just have to find a way
to get rid of her for long enough.

03:16.539 --> 03:18.889
Anna, I still think
I'll save you the trip.

03:18.899 --> 03:20.569
I go in there...
Gino.

03:20.579 --> 03:22.249
This is the only way.

03:23.529 --> 03:25.119
OK?

03:25.129 --> 03:27.359
Who's a beautiful Sarah, then?

03:27.369 --> 03:30.519
Careful. People will start saying
you've gone soft.

03:30.529 --> 03:34.249
Oh, Jack, I've delivered lambs,
calves, foals, pups, kittens,

03:34.259 --> 03:35.689
but never a baby.

03:35.699 --> 03:37.319
Let them.

03:37.329 --> 03:40.049
Eve's saying you and Sarah
agreed to be godparents.

03:40.059 --> 03:42.399
Illegitimate in a country town.

03:42.409 --> 03:45.289
She'll need all the protectors
she can get.

03:45.299 --> 03:47.529
We're just admiring your namesake.

03:47.539 --> 03:49.759
I've had a phone call from my aunt.

03:49.769 --> 03:53.049
My mother's in a very bad way
and she's asking for me.

03:53.059 --> 03:54.589
Take whatever time you need.

03:54.599 --> 03:56.119
We can cover.
Thank you.

03:56.129 --> 03:58.089
I'll take the afternoon train.

04:00.849 --> 04:02.449
She needs changing.

04:04.889 --> 04:06.849
Whew, yes, you do.

04:07.849 --> 04:10.409
I'll give Colin Walker his insulin
shot on the way home.

04:10.419 --> 04:12.679
I can manage the rest.
My dailies are marked.

04:12.689 --> 04:15.129
And the list for each individual day
is in the top drawer.

04:15.139 --> 04:17.089
OK, scoot.
I'll be back as soon as possible.

04:18.048 --> 04:21.529
Sarah? I'm heading up to the city in
an hour or so, if you'd like a lift.

04:21.539 --> 04:23.639
Are you sure?
Quicker than the train.

04:23.649 --> 04:26.409
Thank you.
I'll pick you up at 12:00, then.

04:30.889 --> 04:32.609
He's a friend.
Hm.

04:36.129 --> 04:37.599
You're not escaping.

04:37.609 --> 04:39.799
If I were escaping,
I'd be on a boat home.

04:39.809 --> 04:42.489
Because I thought we'd faced
our problem and were dealing with it.

04:43.609 --> 04:45.324
Our problem?

04:45.334 --> 04:47.039
Alright, mine.

04:47.049 --> 04:48.809
I have married a man who is...

04:50.089 --> 04:52.119
..not like other men,

04:52.129 --> 04:54.929
and I have to find a way
to come to terms with that.

04:57.889 --> 04:59.449
I love you.

05:01.249 --> 05:05.089
When I get back,
I may want separate bedrooms.

05:08.609 --> 05:10.159
That may raise questions.

05:10.169 --> 05:12.439
We can say
it's because of the baby.

05:12.449 --> 05:15.529
I get too hot.
I move around. I can't sleep.

05:16.529 --> 05:18.119
Right.

05:18.129 --> 05:22.049
I am doing this to help us.
I need time away to think.

05:22.059 --> 05:24.249
As long as you keep it to yourself.

05:24.259 --> 05:26.649
I have said I will.

05:33.489 --> 05:35.329
Are my seams straight?

05:39.489 --> 05:41.159
I could do that myself.

05:41.169 --> 05:44.009
You'd have to learn how to test
for glucose in the urine

05:44.019 --> 05:46.089
and sterilise the equipment,
but it's not hard.

05:46.099 --> 05:47.599
You taught Eve?

05:47.609 --> 05:49.329
I offered, but she's terrified
of needles.

05:49.339 --> 05:50.799
Always was a sook.

05:50.809 --> 05:52.489
Very brave sook the other day.

05:52.499 --> 05:53.969
All done.

05:55.409 --> 05:57.609
What do you say?
Thank you.

06:01.209 --> 06:03.089
No sign of Bert?

06:03.471 --> 06:05.911
He knows better
than to show his face around here.

06:05.921 --> 06:08.591
Plus, our brother's
arriving to help out.

06:08.601 --> 06:10.731
Tough, is he?
A bit of a softie.

06:10.741 --> 06:12.871
But Bert doesn't have to know that.

06:18.831 --> 06:21.351
Sister, I got the wrong impression
of you

06:21.361 --> 06:23.431
from things said at the house.

06:23.441 --> 06:25.501
You can't please everyone.

06:25.511 --> 06:28.926
Yes, well, I can't thank you enough.
For everything.

06:28.936 --> 06:32.351
And agreeing to stand up
with Mr. Bligh as godparent...

06:32.361 --> 06:34.261
It's an honour.

06:34.271 --> 06:36.911
He thinks the world of you,
you know?

06:38.071 --> 06:40.381
I've got to get home to pack.
He really does.

06:40.391 --> 06:42.511
I've never heard him talk about
another woman like it.

06:42.521 --> 06:44.391
Except his wife, of course.

06:46.151 --> 06:48.151
Well, I've got him fooled.

06:53.871 --> 06:55.231
Yes?

06:58.671 --> 06:59.661
Yes?

06:59.671 --> 07:02.071
I'd much rather
you didn't go to the city.

07:02.081 --> 07:03.781
Not today.

07:03.791 --> 07:06.791
It's a good chance
to get to know Carolyn better.

07:10.791 --> 07:14.351
George is not stupid.
He's going to notice.

07:14.361 --> 07:17.191
I need to get out of this house.

07:17.313 --> 07:19.633
And I need to say something
to you and James

07:19.643 --> 07:21.993
which requires absolute privacy.

07:22.003 --> 07:23.343
No.

07:23.353 --> 07:26.073
George and Anna's absence
will give us that.

07:27.353 --> 07:31.353
Not many people have ever
said no to you, have they?

07:33.033 --> 07:34.513
As it happens.

07:35.953 --> 07:37.993
Well, I am.

07:39.073 --> 07:40.993
Olivia, this is not a ruse.

07:42.713 --> 07:46.073
What I have to say to you
is of the utmost importance.

07:48.353 --> 07:49.993
I'll wait downstairs for your answer.

07:52.953 --> 07:54.473
I'm begging you.

07:56.153 --> 07:57.713
Something I rarely do.

08:06.193 --> 08:07.663
Don't crush them.

08:07.673 --> 08:10.273
I know how to put a suitcase
in a boot.

08:10.283 --> 08:11.713
Just helping.

08:11.723 --> 08:13.153
Don't help.

08:18.313 --> 08:21.153
Are you intending
to go dressed like that?

08:21.163 --> 08:22.503
Yes.

08:22.513 --> 08:24.063
No hat, no gloves?

08:24.073 --> 08:26.633
Look at Olivia. That's how a lady
dresses for the city.

08:26.643 --> 08:28.713
I've got a hat and gloves
in my bag.

08:28.723 --> 08:30.063
Suitcase.

08:30.073 --> 08:32.212
And if I asked to see them?

08:32.222 --> 08:33.493
It's already packed.

08:33.552 --> 08:35.472
Right at the bottom,
isn't that right, James?

08:37.392 --> 08:40.022
I'll leave you to Carolyn
to sort out when you get there.

08:40.032 --> 08:43.312
She might be able to lend you
a French beret or some jazz garters.

08:44.512 --> 08:46.032
Is that all?

08:48.272 --> 08:49.752
Is it, dear?

08:53.072 --> 08:57.832
Actually, I'm not feeling terribly
well. I think I'd best stay.

08:57.842 --> 08:59.982
Eminently sensible.

08:59.992 --> 09:01.672
It's horrible
travelling when you're sick.

09:01.682 --> 09:03.182
Are you sure?
Yes.

09:03.192 --> 09:05.367
Well, you can always
come next time.

09:05.377 --> 09:07.552
Get your things out, then?
Definitely?

09:07.562 --> 09:09.142
Absolutely.

09:09.152 --> 09:11.662
Aunt Carolyn will understand.

09:11.672 --> 09:15.712
You look after yourself.
James, you keep an eye on her.

09:15.722 --> 09:18.232
Call me if you'd like
something brought back.

09:18.242 --> 09:20.672
Give my love to Carolyn.

09:20.772 --> 09:22.852
I'll be sure to ask her
about jazz garters.

09:30.452 --> 09:33.052
I'd like to speak to you both
in the sitting room.

09:33.062 --> 09:35.772
Olivia has stayed at my request.

09:42.252 --> 09:44.372
It was good of Carla
to step into Amy's shoes.

09:44.382 --> 09:46.212
It was, wasn't it?

09:47.492 --> 09:49.532
Gino's convinced
they'll make a success

09:49.542 --> 09:51.122
of their winemaking one day.

09:51.132 --> 09:53.482
It's not a very economical use
of the land.

09:53.492 --> 09:56.892
If anyone can do it, he can.
Yeah, he's a good lad.

09:56.902 --> 09:58.672
So you like him?

09:58.682 --> 10:00.452
Of course I do.

10:01.732 --> 10:03.892
He'll make someone
a good husband one day.

10:03.902 --> 10:05.842
What?

10:05.852 --> 10:07.452
You and your romantic novels.

10:11.452 --> 10:13.092
This isn't the way
to the main road.

10:13.102 --> 10:14.842
We're on a secret mission.

10:14.852 --> 10:16.732
Not a word to your grandmother.

10:22.772 --> 10:24.732
This is breaking
the silence of decades.

10:27.052 --> 10:29.292
A silence I never thought
I'd break.

10:31.212 --> 10:34.292
Your grandfather
enjoyed male company.

10:35.492 --> 10:37.907
At the time, it didn't seem unusual.

10:37.917 --> 10:40.322
Men and women led separate lives.

10:40.332 --> 10:43.132
Women, their households
and families.

10:43.142 --> 10:47.002
Men, their work, clubs, sports.

10:47.012 --> 10:50.172
My husband was like that.
A man's man.

10:54.292 --> 10:58.522
I was a young bride and naive,

10:58.532 --> 11:01.682
but certain incidents made me realise

11:01.692 --> 11:05.812
that some of his friendships
were more than just that.

11:07.812 --> 11:11.012
And when I arrived
in England last year...

11:12.372 --> 11:14.492
..and I saw James and your brother...

11:17.132 --> 11:18.852
..there was my husband.

11:21.781 --> 11:24.581
You must have wondered why
I understood what I saw.

11:24.591 --> 11:26.621
I'd seen it before.

11:28.381 --> 11:31.491
These... incidents...

11:31.501 --> 11:35.371
No. The reason I'm taking you
into my confidence

11:35.381 --> 11:41.621
is to say to you that your marriage,
like mine, can be made to work.

11:42.581 --> 11:46.651
James's nature is James's nature,

11:46.661 --> 11:50.541
but clearly part of it allows him
to father a child.

11:53.741 --> 11:56.356
As my dear husband could.

11:56.366 --> 11:58.981
We made a marriage together.

12:00.981 --> 12:02.461
It took work.

12:04.741 --> 12:06.261
It involved pain...

12:08.741 --> 12:12.061
..compromise, but all marriages do.

12:15.261 --> 12:17.101
We found our own happiness.

12:18.661 --> 12:22.701
It has been done before.
It can be done again.

12:24.661 --> 12:26.261
You should have told me.

12:28.621 --> 12:30.661
It would have helped.

12:30.671 --> 12:32.701
Perhaps.

12:34.181 --> 12:38.061
I've said my say. I think
further discussion is between you.

12:38.071 --> 12:40.461
Unless you have something to say.

12:42.581 --> 12:44.851
Not yet.

12:44.861 --> 12:47.181
Does Father know?

12:48.421 --> 12:50.341
And never will.

13:18.120 --> 13:21.600
I always thought
I was the freak of the family.

13:21.657 --> 13:24.877
She always talked about him
so warmly.

13:24.913 --> 13:27.273
Never a bad word.

13:27.283 --> 13:29.073
What now?

13:33.943 --> 13:35.563
Do as they did.

13:37.774 --> 13:42.254
She lived it
and she doomed me to it.

13:44.374 --> 13:46.054
Part of me hates her.

13:47.414 --> 13:49.334
That's not fair.
Isn't it?

13:50.334 --> 13:54.654
Did all those years of compromise
make her what she is?

13:54.664 --> 13:58.214
Because I don't want to end up
like her.

14:22.894 --> 14:25.094
I know how hard
that must have been.

14:25.175 --> 14:28.815
Was it worthwhile?
Or has she fled to pack?

14:28.825 --> 14:30.455
No.

14:32.015 --> 14:35.895
I did what I thought was needed,
what I hope was right.

14:35.905 --> 14:38.365
We may be needing
separate bedrooms.

14:38.375 --> 14:41.510
Your grandfather and I
had a similar arrangement.

14:41.520 --> 14:44.655
You'll think of something
to say to the family.

14:49.255 --> 14:51.175
I best...

15:02.255 --> 15:03.925
You grew up here?

15:03.935 --> 15:06.855
It's not Ash Park,
but it wasn't so bad.

15:06.865 --> 15:09.295
I raised a snob.
I'm not.

15:09.305 --> 15:10.895
I'm teasing.

15:12.095 --> 15:16.055
Aunty Peg. How is she?
I'm glad you're here, love.

15:16.065 --> 15:18.575
This is Mr. Bligh
and his daughter, Anna.

15:18.585 --> 15:21.095
How do you do?
I've heard a lot about you.

15:21.105 --> 15:23.295
You've been very kind to Bridget.

15:23.305 --> 15:24.655
Uh, Sarah.

15:26.895 --> 15:29.645
Thank you.
She's given as good as she's got.

15:29.655 --> 15:32.775
Now, if you need a lift back,
leave a message at the Union Club.

15:32.785 --> 15:34.405
That's where I'm staying.
Thank you.

15:34.415 --> 15:36.295
And good luck with your mother.
Thank you.

15:36.305 --> 15:38.095
Good... Goodbye.

15:43.495 --> 15:46.165
She called her Bridget.
I noticed.

15:46.175 --> 15:49.655
Well, here's this woman
who has a superb seat on a horse,

15:49.665 --> 15:51.405
can handle a shotgun like a soldier,

15:51.415 --> 15:55.015
speaks all these different languages
and she can down that horrible Bert.

15:55.025 --> 15:57.495
All going to prove
she's a Russian secret agent?

15:57.505 --> 15:59.765
And she's changed her name.

15:59.775 --> 16:02.335
Surely you want to know
the whole story?

16:02.374 --> 16:04.084
And she might tell me, one day.

16:04.094 --> 16:05.774
But I'm not going to
cross-examine her.

16:05.784 --> 16:07.414
And nor will you.

16:10.654 --> 16:13.669
She's drifting
in and out of consciousness.

16:13.679 --> 16:16.694
When she's awake,
she's desperate to see you.

16:33.094 --> 16:34.774
Pulse is faint.

16:35.974 --> 16:38.484
When did the doctor see her last?

16:38.494 --> 16:41.654
This morning.
He didn't suggest hospital?

16:41.664 --> 16:43.774
Nothing to be done, he said.

16:43.784 --> 16:45.894
I told him you're a nurse.

16:48.214 --> 16:50.134
And she wanted to stay.

16:55.454 --> 16:58.004
I like that outfit.

16:58.014 --> 17:00.694
Let me guess.
You had to battle Mother over it.

17:00.704 --> 17:02.004
Yes.

17:02.014 --> 17:05.054
God love her. She never changes.

17:05.064 --> 17:06.364
Hold this.

17:06.374 --> 17:08.574
Don't drop it
or you'll see a grown woman cry.

17:08.584 --> 17:10.884
Gin, vermouth and olives.

17:10.894 --> 17:12.684
To quote the divine Miss Parker,

17:12.694 --> 17:16.124
"I do like a dry martini,
one or two at the most.

17:16.134 --> 17:18.894
"Three, I'm under the table,
four, I'm under the host."

17:21.054 --> 17:23.204
You'll love 'South Pacific'.

17:23.214 --> 17:25.364
And afterwards, we'll go backstage

17:25.374 --> 17:28.003
and I'll introduce you
to some friends in the chorus.

17:28.013 --> 17:30.854
Her virtue will be entirely safe
in their company, George.

17:30.864 --> 17:32.814
Though I'd not vouch for yours.

17:32.824 --> 17:34.284
I won't stay.

17:34.294 --> 17:36.574
We're here a few days,
so we've got plenty of time.

17:36.584 --> 17:38.324
A little bird has told me

17:38.334 --> 17:41.294
that Mother's been dangling
Andrew Swanson in front of you.

17:41.304 --> 17:44.254
Throwing him in my face
is more like it.

17:44.264 --> 17:45.724
Don't marry him.

17:45.734 --> 17:48.454
His mother's barely tolerable
and his father is a monster.

17:48.464 --> 17:50.244
Oh, Sir Henry, he's alright.

17:50.254 --> 17:52.194
Takes more than a visit
to Buckingham Palace

17:52.198 --> 17:55.118
and a whack on the shoulder
with a sword to cure that sort.

17:55.128 --> 17:56.988
Anna's to have nothing
to do with them.

17:56.998 --> 17:58.348
I'm having dinner with him
at the club this evening.

17:58.358 --> 18:02.893
Ask him if his Double Bay mistress
is enjoying her new flat.

18:02.903 --> 18:07.438
Hear no evil. Don't lead her astray.
Don't be led astray.

18:07.448 --> 18:09.678
'Bye.

18:11.198 --> 18:14.358
Now, girl, I'm very happy
to take you to the theatre,

18:14.368 --> 18:16.478
but what's this trip
really about?

18:27.918 --> 18:31.718
Bridget? Is that you?
Yes, Mum, yes.

18:31.728 --> 18:33.788
I've sinned terribly.
No, no.

18:33.798 --> 18:36.038
You have to help me find absolution.

18:37.358 --> 18:39.253
Aunty Peg?

18:39.263 --> 18:41.148
Oh, yes, dear?

18:41.158 --> 18:44.878
Parish priest?
Father Pat.

18:44.888 --> 18:46.758
Now. And the doctor.

18:48.358 --> 18:49.478
Yes.

18:51.838 --> 18:54.558
Let me die in God's glory.
Don't let me die damned.

18:54.568 --> 18:55.548
Mum.

18:55.558 --> 18:58.598
You're the only one
that can save my soul.

19:00.358 --> 19:02.038
I promised you to Him.

19:02.998 --> 19:06.118
But you became one of them
that took his Son.

19:08.598 --> 19:14.958
Return to Him before I go
or I'II-I'll die...

19:14.968 --> 19:17.958
I'll burn...
I'll burn in Hell forever.

19:19.118 --> 19:23.318
Shh. Shh. Shh.

19:29.558 --> 19:34.198
So, you and this young man
of yours are...how shall I put it?

19:34.208 --> 19:38.678
At it like knives?
We've made love, yes.

19:38.688 --> 19:42.158
Has he asked you to marry him?
Yes.

19:43.918 --> 19:46.278
Has he spoken to your father?

19:46.420 --> 19:48.460
We... We have to work
towards that.

19:52.820 --> 19:54.580
That is so sweet.

19:56.340 --> 19:59.420
So George would find him unsuitable?
And Grandmother.

19:59.430 --> 20:02.100
She finds most of the world
unsuitable.

20:02.110 --> 20:04.850
We're in love. And we're lovers.

20:04.860 --> 20:08.700
And we can't stop and we will get
married, but not yet,

20:08.710 --> 20:10.820
and...I need birth control.

20:12.900 --> 20:14.540
You've got to help me.

20:14.550 --> 20:16.460
I see.
Please?

20:17.860 --> 20:20.420
I don't imagine there's any point
in our discussing this?

20:20.430 --> 20:22.490
None.

20:22.500 --> 20:27.500
If I suggested you stop
until you're safely married?

20:27.510 --> 20:33.060
It's something beautiful.
Try to understand.

20:35.340 --> 20:38.580
Never fear, my doctor is a woman,
not some ghastly old man.

20:38.590 --> 20:40.260
I'll make an appointment.

20:46.096 --> 20:52.031
Ego te absolvo
ab omnibus peccatis et censuris,

20:52.041 --> 20:57.976
in nomine Patris
et Filii et Spiritus Sancti.

20:58.083 --> 20:59.123
Amen.

21:31.003 --> 21:34.643
Hail Mary, full of grace,
the Lord is with thee.

21:34.653 --> 21:36.073
Blessed art thou amongst women

21:36.083 --> 21:37.913
and blessed is the fruit
of thy womb, Jesus.

21:37.923 --> 21:39.963
Holy Mary, Mother of God,
pray for us sinners now

21:39.973 --> 21:41.403
and at the hour of our death.

21:41.413 --> 21:42.633
Amen.

21:42.643 --> 21:44.793
Hail Mary, full of grace,
the Lord is with thee.

21:44.803 --> 21:47.683
Blessed art thou amongst women and
blessed is the fruit of thy womb, Jesus.

21:47.693 --> 21:49.683
Holy Mary, Mother of God,
pray for us sinners now

21:49.693 --> 21:51.283
and at the hour of our death.

21:51.293 --> 21:52.273
Amen.

21:52.283 --> 21:54.393
Hail, Mary, full of Grace,
the Lord is with thee.

21:54.403 --> 21:58.243
Blessed art thou amongst women and
blessed is the fruit of thy womb, Jesus.

21:58.253 --> 22:00.283
Holy Mary, Mother of God,
pray for us sinners now

22:00.293 --> 22:02.083
and at the hour of our death.

22:02.093 --> 22:03.233
Amen.

22:03.243 --> 22:07.033
Hail Mary, full of grace,
the Lord is with thee.

22:07.043 --> 22:10.323
Blessed art thou amongst women and
blessed is the fruit of thy womb, Jesus.

22:10.333 --> 22:12.683
Holy Mary, Mother of God,
pray for us sinners now

22:12.693 --> 22:14.123
and at the hour of our death.

22:14.133 --> 22:15.163
Amen.

22:24.603 --> 22:27.883
Oh, my darling girl.

22:29.243 --> 22:32.043
Let it out. Let it out.
It's just...

22:32.053 --> 22:34.073
I know, I know.

22:34.083 --> 22:39.403
You're crying for what should
have been, not what is.

22:39.413 --> 22:43.083
Poor, sad Grace.

22:44.483 --> 22:46.243
Oh, my love.

22:54.454 --> 22:58.134
That was wonderful.
Such a beautiful story!

22:58.144 --> 23:00.414
Thank you.
The pleasure was mine.

23:00.424 --> 23:03.004
A nightcap?
No, not for me.

23:03.014 --> 23:05.084
That song where Lieutenant Cable says

23:05.094 --> 23:07.334
we're taught to hate people
who are different...

23:07.344 --> 23:08.804
There's a lot of truth in that.

23:08.814 --> 23:13.054
Have you ever been in love
with anyone...different?

23:13.064 --> 23:14.644
Oh, you're referring, of course,

23:14.654 --> 23:17.574
to my long line
of Negro and Asiatic lovers.

23:17.584 --> 23:19.814
Ha!
Or are you talking about yourself?

23:21.774 --> 23:23.334
He's Italian.

23:23.344 --> 23:25.094
Oh, boy.

23:28.854 --> 23:30.604
Mother hinted on the phone

23:30.614 --> 23:32.884
that George is falling for
a Jewess.

23:32.894 --> 23:35.334
And now her granddaughter's
falling for a dago.

23:35.344 --> 23:36.974
Catholic, I assume.

23:36.984 --> 23:38.694
Yes.

23:40.934 --> 23:43.974
Well, I wish I could be more optimistic
for you, but I'm not going to lie.

23:44.064 --> 23:45.704
Mother will explode.

23:47.884 --> 23:49.724
I know.

23:52.206 --> 23:54.406
Perhaps I will have one of those.

23:55.406 --> 23:57.806
Slip into your nightie
and I'll have it waiting for you.

24:10.846 --> 24:12.836
How is your son?

24:12.846 --> 24:16.126
I wouldn't put too much store
on my wife's matchmaking.

24:16.136 --> 24:19.406
- Anna knows her own mind.
- Quite.

24:19.416 --> 24:22.686
Things will...take their course.

24:23.480 --> 24:25.200
Now, the matter I wanted to...

24:25.210 --> 24:27.080
..to talk about.

24:27.090 --> 24:28.950
It's delicate.

24:28.960 --> 24:31.030
Your wife.
Elaine?

24:31.040 --> 24:34.720
I understand she was killed when
the Japanese first bombed Darwin.

24:34.730 --> 24:36.110
Yes.

24:36.120 --> 24:38.600
Well, since they opened
their embassy earlier this year,

24:38.610 --> 24:40.800
relations have started to expand.

24:40.810 --> 24:41.790
And?

24:41.800 --> 24:44.950
There's a trade delegation
coming through.

24:44.960 --> 24:47.500
And the Government is calling on
people it can trust

24:47.535 --> 24:50.085
to show them what Australia
has to offer.

24:50.095 --> 24:51.935
Just because we fought them
doesn't mean to say

24:51.945 --> 24:53.695
we can't profit by them.

24:53.705 --> 24:55.445
And you'd like me to...

24:55.455 --> 24:58.455
Ash Park is close enough to Sydney
to make a day trip possible.

24:58.465 --> 25:00.805
You'd like me to play host?

25:00.815 --> 25:03.975
To a group of Japanese public
servants and businessmen, yes.

25:03.985 --> 25:07.035
Any former bomber pilots
among them?

25:07.045 --> 25:10.095
Nobody would blame you
if you refused.

25:10.105 --> 25:11.855
Sir Henry.
Ah, Prime Minister!

25:11.865 --> 25:13.565
A pleasant surprise.

25:13.575 --> 25:16.095
Prime Minister, may I present
Mr. George Bligh?

25:16.105 --> 25:17.685
Pleasure to meet you, sir.

25:17.695 --> 25:20.455
Now, George is a grazier,
and I'm endeavouring to persuade him

25:20.465 --> 25:23.285
to assist with the visit
of the Japanese delegation.

25:23.295 --> 25:26.125
They're going to be very important
trading partners, Mr. Bligh.

25:26.135 --> 25:29.975
Any assistance you might be able to
render will be greatly appreciated.

25:29.985 --> 25:31.445
I'll certainly consider...

25:31.455 --> 25:33.415
George and I were discussing
the atomic test earlier.

25:33.425 --> 25:34.925
Any further word on that?

25:34.935 --> 25:37.815
Need to know, Henry.
Russian agents and all that.

25:37.825 --> 25:39.805
I just hope they manage it

25:39.815 --> 25:42.135
before Vice President Nixon
arrives next week.

25:43.495 --> 25:46.535
I'm going to be late.
Good to meet you, Mr. Bligh.

25:46.545 --> 25:48.695
Don't play that scoundrel for money.

25:52.215 --> 25:54.375
Was trotting out the Prime Minister
meant to impress me?

25:54.385 --> 25:56.695
Nobody trots out Robert Menzies.

25:56.705 --> 25:59.015
But we do want you involved in this.

26:00.655 --> 26:03.365
The Japanese are no longer
our enemies.

26:03.375 --> 26:05.525
Try telling that to the people
at Inverness.

26:05.535 --> 26:09.215
See, I'm not the only one
with unhealed memories.

26:09.225 --> 26:11.015
A message, Mr. Bligh.

26:11.025 --> 26:12.495
Thank you.

26:47.415 --> 26:50.015
Love, you've got a visitor.

26:51.215 --> 26:53.215
Coming.

26:58.241 --> 26:59.911
I got your message.

26:59.921 --> 27:02.756
Oh. I wasn't intending
to drag you here.

27:02.766 --> 27:05.601
If I'm in the way...
No, no, no, it's...

27:06.601 --> 27:09.671
It's very kind.
You stop your apologising.

27:09.681 --> 27:12.801
Why don't you make
Mr. Bligh a nice cup of tea?

27:12.811 --> 27:15.041
Of course.
The voice of reason.

27:15.051 --> 27:17.281
Through here.
Night-night, love.

27:18.361 --> 27:19.841
Goodnight.
Goodnight.

27:25.441 --> 27:27.001
Thank you.

27:32.401 --> 27:35.921
You've earned the truth.
That's up to you.

27:35.931 --> 27:38.041
It'll help you understand this.

27:40.721 --> 27:43.561
I had a lot of pressure on me
to become a nun.

27:45.001 --> 27:48.881
Aunty Peg sent me to France
to visit my father's grave,

27:48.891 --> 27:50.881
to help me get some perspective
away from Mum.

27:50.891 --> 27:53.001
How old were you?

27:54.081 --> 27:55.591
19.

27:55.601 --> 27:58.071
I was standing in Fromelles

27:58.081 --> 28:00.241
looking at his name
on the wall and...

28:01.721 --> 28:04.641
I just knew I couldn't...
I couldn't go back.

28:07.081 --> 28:09.321
I was crying, and a man asked
if he could help.

28:10.681 --> 28:13.601
His name was Rene Nordmann.

28:13.611 --> 28:15.441
Dr. Nordmann.

28:16.961 --> 28:18.961
And I met him again
years later, in Spain.

28:20.161 --> 28:22.601
I was holding the hand
of a dying soldier,

28:22.611 --> 28:24.241
and I looked up, and there he was.

28:26.001 --> 28:27.761
It was love at second sight.

28:32.081 --> 28:35.841
I converted to marry him, and I was
dead to my mother from then on.

28:37.601 --> 28:39.081
And your husband?

28:40.441 --> 28:42.321
The Nazis.

28:43.961 --> 28:45.001
Sorry.

28:46.241 --> 28:50.071
So I never became a nun,
and Mum...

28:50.081 --> 28:53.881
Mum, she lived in fear for her soul
because of that.

28:57.736 --> 28:59.536
But I let her die in peace.

29:01.576 --> 29:04.216
Let her believe
that I'd returned to the fold.

29:09.856 --> 29:11.896
It's a lie I can live with.

29:33.856 --> 29:35.536
I'll see you in the morning.

29:36.736 --> 29:38.096
Goodnight.

29:41.296 --> 29:43.096
It's time you went upstairs.

29:46.296 --> 29:49.016
Our bed is an icefield.

29:49.026 --> 29:51.086
Then warm it.

29:51.096 --> 29:54.536
I've done my part, you do yours.
And freshen yourself.

29:54.546 --> 29:57.296
She deserves better
than the stench of alcohol.

30:17.296 --> 30:19.136
Still awake?

30:20.856 --> 30:22.936
'The Anniversary Waltz'.

30:22.946 --> 30:24.086
Darling...

30:24.096 --> 30:29.016
Either I put it in a drawer
and we play it every year...

30:30.176 --> 30:34.336
..for as many years as we have,
or I smash it.

30:35.896 --> 30:38.096
That would mean
our marriage is over.

30:39.576 --> 30:41.486
Which is it to be?

30:41.496 --> 30:45.016
I don't... I don't want us to end.

31:11.296 --> 31:12.776
Then prove it.

31:16.656 --> 31:17.816
Now.

32:14.918 --> 32:18.188
I missed you both at breakfast.

32:18.198 --> 32:23.478
I trust that means
things are settling.

32:23.600 --> 32:28.280
We're working on our marriage.
Which is what you wanted.

32:29.160 --> 32:31.440
All marriages require effort.

32:31.450 --> 32:33.440
Some more than others.

32:34.600 --> 32:39.800
James has gone riding.
We both have a lot to consider.

32:39.810 --> 32:42.960
I do want you
to think of me as a friend.

32:44.360 --> 32:47.975
I told you the truth,
as a true friend should.

32:47.985 --> 32:51.600
Oh, Olivia, James loves you now,
I know he does.

32:51.610 --> 32:55.720
How can I believe anything you say?

32:57.080 --> 32:59.760
Do you doubt my motives?
Yes.

33:01.953 --> 33:06.233
Do you honestly think
I would break the silence of decades

33:06.243 --> 33:09.063
for anything
but the best of reasons?

33:09.073 --> 33:14.793
You've shown you'll do anything
to protect the family, so perhaps.

33:14.803 --> 33:18.513
There has never been a divorce
in this family

33:18.523 --> 33:20.223
and there never will be.

33:20.233 --> 33:24.353
You have lost the right
to even try to dictate to me!

33:26.073 --> 33:32.113
The way you endured your own
marriage was brave, noble even.

33:33.073 --> 33:37.073
But you knew first-hand
about James's nature

33:37.083 --> 33:39.583
and you didn't speak.

33:39.593 --> 33:44.353
And when I think of the poor girl
marrying my brother, I could weep.

33:44.363 --> 33:46.993
We're both trapped.

33:57.873 --> 33:58.873
Oh!

34:03.513 --> 34:04.553
Oh!

34:28.793 --> 34:30.793
Mr. James!

34:33.273 --> 34:34.263
Gino.

34:34.273 --> 34:37.268
What are you doing here?

34:37.277 --> 34:40.273
I come here to...think.

34:40.411 --> 34:41.891
Sometimes.

34:43.891 --> 34:45.972
I've never seen you here before.

34:47.452 --> 34:52.331
I...needed to think too.

34:52.342 --> 34:53.972
Ah.

34:57.412 --> 35:00.612
Well, I won't disturb you.

35:02.772 --> 35:04.732
Anna is in the city.

35:05.692 --> 35:08.132
Yes.
Have you heard from her?

35:08.142 --> 35:09.492
What?

35:09.502 --> 35:10.852
No.

35:11.812 --> 35:15.052
I saw her... Ran in to her, yeah.

35:23.052 --> 35:24.652
I'll go.

36:15.132 --> 36:17.322
You'll be fine.

36:17.332 --> 36:19.322
A contraceptive diaphragm.

36:19.332 --> 36:22.682
It physically blocks the semen.

36:22.692 --> 36:26.452
And the spermicide you smear on it
also has an effect.

36:26.462 --> 36:30.412
Like any contraceptive,
it's not 100% effective,

36:30.422 --> 36:33.072
but at the moment,
it's the best we've got.

36:33.082 --> 36:35.732
Hm! It's a shame
you can't just take a pill.

36:36.692 --> 36:38.162
For the moment,

36:38.172 --> 36:42.052
the only pill that works is the one
that you hold between your knees.

36:44.978 --> 36:46.608
Knees up.

36:46.618 --> 36:49.378
We need to make sure
it will fit properly.

36:49.388 --> 36:50.888
Legs apart.

36:50.898 --> 36:53.498
Have you ever had
an internal examination?

36:54.458 --> 36:55.448
No.

36:55.458 --> 36:59.178
They can be a little bit unpleasant.

37:00.378 --> 37:01.898
Just try to relax.

37:05.898 --> 37:08.073
Deep breath in.

37:08.083 --> 37:10.258
And breathe out.

37:13.458 --> 37:16.618
Just try to relax.
Probably feels a little bit cold.

37:16.628 --> 37:18.458
It will be over soon, don't worry.

37:19.458 --> 37:21.738
If you wiggle about, it can pinch.

37:21.748 --> 37:23.498
Try to stay still.

37:24.458 --> 37:26.273
That's it.

37:26.283 --> 37:28.098
Deep breaths.

37:33.978 --> 37:37.888
Here is the news from the ABC
read by Michael Eisdell.

37:37.898 --> 37:42.738
The first nuclear test on Australian
soil has taken place at Emu Flats.

37:42.748 --> 37:45.728
The Russians ask
the UN Security Council

37:45.738 --> 37:48.738
to overrule the British and American
decisions on Trieste.

37:48.748 --> 37:50.248
Turn it off.

37:50.258 --> 37:52.098
Holland gets its first three
female police officers.

37:52.108 --> 37:56.688
Oh, atom bombs, the Cold War,
women police.

37:56.698 --> 37:59.898
Hm! Sometimes I wonder
what the world's coming to.

38:03.978 --> 38:07.338
Does that mean I'm getting old?
You are not old.

38:09.098 --> 38:12.633
Two world wars, a depression,

38:12.643 --> 38:16.178
four kings, two queens. I'm...

38:17.298 --> 38:20.258
I'm so tired of change.
Me also.

38:20.268 --> 38:21.938
No, thank you.

38:30.898 --> 38:34.098
Mr. Bligh and Miss Anna
will be back with us today.

38:35.298 --> 38:37.098
Yes.

38:42.227 --> 38:44.227
It was good of you
to stay for the funeral.

38:44.237 --> 38:45.707
I wanted to.

38:48.227 --> 38:49.987
It feels like a new start.

38:50.947 --> 38:53.387
You do seem to have resolved a lot.

38:53.397 --> 38:55.187
A lot.

38:56.227 --> 38:58.017
And I'm home.

38:58.027 --> 38:59.657
That's the first time

38:59.667 --> 39:01.667
I've heard you use that word
in relation to Inverness.

39:01.677 --> 39:03.307
That's how I feel now.

39:03.317 --> 39:04.787
Good.

39:06.307 --> 39:09.067
I'd like to take you on a picnic
tomorrow. Just the two of us.

39:09.077 --> 39:12.387
I'm... I'm working.
I can work around your lunch hour.

39:12.397 --> 39:14.947
You have to eat.
Aren't you sick of me?

39:14.957 --> 39:16.427
Never.

39:18.147 --> 39:19.787
I'd like that.

39:21.227 --> 39:22.747
Thank you.

39:24.947 --> 39:26.427
For everything.

39:45.562 --> 39:47.522
Oh, I missed you so much!

39:47.593 --> 39:48.873
Oh!

39:51.462 --> 39:53.917
I came each day
hoping you'd be back.

39:53.927 --> 39:56.372
I've got everything we need
to be safe.

39:56.382 --> 39:59.382
Well, did your aunty understand?
She could see how much I love you.

39:59.392 --> 40:01.662
I thought about you all the time.

40:02.822 --> 40:04.452
I thought about a lot of things.

40:04.462 --> 40:08.822
When I went to the doctor, I was
lying there, and it was so horrible,

40:08.832 --> 40:11.442
and it made me feel dirty
in some way.

40:11.452 --> 40:14.052
And I don't want to feel like that.

40:14.062 --> 40:18.382
This isn't wrong,
not if we're honest with everyone.

40:19.662 --> 40:21.092
Are you sure?

40:21.102 --> 40:25.582
This ring should be on my finger,
not hidden as if I'm ashamed of it.

40:25.592 --> 40:29.102
I want you to wear it.
I want to wear it.

40:29.112 --> 40:30.902
I want you to.

40:33.262 --> 40:34.862
We'll have to be strong.

40:36.462 --> 40:38.102
We will be.

40:50.182 --> 40:51.612
Amy.

40:51.622 --> 40:53.502
Hello, sir!

40:54.902 --> 40:57.052
What's the news with your sister?

40:57.062 --> 41:00.182
She'll be in there a while yet.
Bert did a right job on her back.

41:00.192 --> 41:01.972
What can I be doing for you?

41:01.982 --> 41:05.262
I just came over to see if there's
anything I can do to help.

41:05.272 --> 41:08.262
Really? That's much appreciated.

41:08.272 --> 41:11.262
I know my brother could use a hand.

41:11.272 --> 41:13.012
Hey, lazybones!

41:13.022 --> 41:14.582
Come and see who's here!

41:16.382 --> 41:18.422
You remember Harry?

41:20.022 --> 41:21.462
Hello, James.

41:30.102 --> 41:32.902
Anything particular I missed
while I was away?

41:32.912 --> 41:34.372
No.

41:34.382 --> 41:36.702
Anything particular that I missed?

41:37.742 --> 41:38.862
No.

41:40.062 --> 41:42.302
It's good to have you back.
It's good to be back.

41:43.902 --> 41:45.422
George.

41:46.822 --> 41:49.302
You stayed longer than anticipated.
Yes.

41:52.742 --> 41:55.422
I'm sure you had your reasons.

41:55.432 --> 41:56.742
I did.

41:57.742 --> 42:00.542
I won't be long. I'll just give
the place a once-over.

42:27.622 --> 42:29.102
Uh. Help me.
