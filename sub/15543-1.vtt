CALL OF DUTY

11:00.292 --> 11:03.455
You perfected the drug itself, NichoIas.

11:03.562 --> 11:06.531
If you will not do what I recommend to you,

11:06.699 --> 11:08.997
I see no other options.

11:13.005 --> 11:14.802
So be it.

11:51.744 --> 11:55.236
Gentlemen, to continue with this meeting ...

11:55.314 --> 11:57.839
Last year, we made an investment in a program miIitar

11:57.917 --> 11:59.782
meIhorou that internal security

12:00.086 --> 12:02.486
cost about 500 biIhões of dóIares,

12:02.555 --> 12:05.388
with a return of six triIhões.

12:05.925 --> 12:07.593
I'm sorry, I'm boring you?

12:07.593 --> 12:09.762
Um, Jack? I can taIk?

12:09.762 --> 12:12.253

12:12.331 --> 12:14.526
Thank you. CavaIheiros,

12:14.734 --> 12:17.464
I think the decision is meIhor go this way.

12:17.536 --> 12:18.471
Pharmaceutical industry?

12:18.471 --> 12:21.668
This is ridícuIo, invest triIhões of dóIares meIhorar to this country,

12:21.741 --> 12:23.776
and now you want us to invest in what drugs?

12:23.776 --> 12:26.472
Well, not Any extra type of drug, please IEIA.

12:26.645 --> 12:29.705
AIgumas this information dates back to the Second MundiaI War.

12:29.815 --> 12:32.648
- Are you sure this is correct? - Forget if this is correct.

12:32.785 --> 12:34.946
This drug has emerged during the Nazi era.

12:35.054 --> 12:35.986
It IegaI?

12:36.055 --> 12:37.857
Let's not forget that our investment úItimo

12:37.857 --> 12:40.291
it was during the Soviet Union, originated in the government of StaIin.

12:40.359 --> 12:42.020
AIEM you, who will believe it?

12:42.294 --> 12:43.625
I was under the impression that this forum

12:43.696 --> 12:46.893
It was about finding ways to reaIistas meIhorar our world.

12:47.399 --> 12:49.629
Do not chase comic fantasies.

12:49.835 --> 12:52.804
- She was offended. - This is not the way forward meIhor.

12:53.038 --> 12:55.472
I agree, this is compIetamente ridícuIo.

12:55.541 --> 12:58.533
Now, wait a minute. I know aIguns of you are new here,

12:58.644 --> 13:01.408
and aIguns of you apparently forgot,

13:01.647 --> 13:04.377
but úItimos five years of success of the CounciI,

13:04.450 --> 13:06.816
Suggestions came from this man.

13:07.286 --> 13:10.221
- I say, we should hear Io. - Thank you.

13:10.990 --> 13:13.254
Our own government funded it.

13:13.359 --> 13:15.293
Which means there has to be Aigo atready.

13:15.494 --> 13:17.985
Funded since stopped.

13:19.298 --> 13:20.424
Well, yes.

13:20.533 --> 13:22.262
There must be a reason for it.

13:23.402 --> 13:25.199
Are you listening?

13:25.304 --> 13:27.573
This scientist discovered a way to cure all diseases

13:27.573 --> 13:28.974
Peio known man.

13:28.974 --> 13:31.704
- incIuding the enveIhecimento. - It's a fairy tale.

13:32.011 --> 13:34.741
A waste of time, effort and money.

13:34.880 --> 13:36.472
I could not agree more.

13:37.917 --> 13:40.511
You know, if you want to taIk the obvious, just ask eIa.

13:40.586 --> 13:42.884
Wait a minute, you're going from Iimites.

13:44.957 --> 13:47.448
They feel the two.

13:57.503 --> 13:59.630
It takes an army to Iutar one bataIha,

13:59.805 --> 14:01.473
but it takes a great Iíder, courage,

14:01.473 --> 14:03.668
and risk to win a war.

14:03.742 --> 14:06.812
I'll be investing in it pessoaImente.

14:06.812 --> 14:08.211
Somebody else?

14:11.817 --> 14:14.411
There is a name for our scientist?

14:14.486 --> 14:16.283
Yes, yes, there is.

14:17.556 --> 14:19.615
NichoIas Dr. Bergman.

14:22.561 --> 14:25.428
I'm sorry that things have gone rather ControI today.

14:25.998 --> 14:27.898
I understand, they are business.

14:27.967 --> 14:30.663
But you understand that I can not have you coming with us?

14:31.937 --> 14:33.336
Got it.

14:40.546 --> 14:43.344
1 June 1, 201 3.

14:44.984 --> 14:47.817
I'm starting to get impatient.

14:48.287 --> 14:50.482
I exhausted all my resources.

14:52.291 --> 14:55.628
Experiment 40B-2.

14:55.628 --> 14:58.756
And the same effects as the 40B-1.

14:59.999 --> 15:03.867
The process however, was faster in five and a half hours.

15:04.937 --> 15:08.373
Making it the fastest process

15:08.674 --> 15:11.700
in about 21 hours.

15:25.391 --> 15:29.191
Soon there will be investors coming.

15:30.763 --> 15:32.628
Do Human lnteresse Party.

15:33.899 --> 15:37.266
They will visit my place and see examples of my work.

15:38.771 --> 15:40.539
If things go well,

15:40.539 --> 15:42.541
I'll have more than enough to reactivate

15:42.541 --> 15:46.204
all instaIação and continue my father's research.

15:56.655 --> 16:00.591
And if not, God help them all.

18:19.832 --> 18:22.630
I do not understand why you are so recIamando addition,

18:22.701 --> 18:24.436
I think that the mission was a success.

18:24.436 --> 18:27.200
Considering the shit information we had.

18:27.339 --> 18:28.533
There is.

18:28.607 --> 18:30.234
There is?

18:30.309 --> 18:31.936
That was a sigh?

18:32.010 --> 18:34.535
You became Mrs.. GaIIo suddenly?

18:36.582 --> 18:40.450
Oh, we went, I'm kidding, quai is your probIem?

18:40.686 --> 18:43.255
Because the decision has made the interpreter died? Atready I know ...

18:43.255 --> 18:44.957
Atready we face, it was heavy.

18:44.957 --> 18:47.721
If we had done nothing, I assure you that,

18:47.826 --> 18:50.329
in fact, I would give IHE WatzeI guarantee

18:50.329 --> 18:52.231
and you know that this is a good guarantee,

18:52.231 --> 18:53.630
both were killed.

18:53.732 --> 18:54.800
You do not know it.

18:54.800 --> 18:56.735
Hey man, IEE took the initiative and we did.

18:56.735 --> 18:58.430
Yeah, it was a direct order from HQ

18:58.504 --> 19:01.132
HQ has no idea what the hell is going on.

19:01.240 --> 19:02.708
You know, you know,

19:02.708 --> 19:05.541

Man, I can not wait to never eat

19:42.748 --> 19:44.409

19:45.284 --> 19:46.911
I wonder why the captain did not joined us yet.

19:46.985 --> 19:48.850
TaIvez EIE has finaImente taken a vacation.

19:48.921 --> 19:50.513
Vacation?

19:50.589 --> 19:54.184
The idea of ​​the holiday captain is sitting behind his desk in his office.

19:54.293 --> 19:56.727
I think Somebody needs a atuaIização on the holiday setting.

19:56.795 --> 20:00.196
I think Somebody needs a atuaIização the definition of table manners.

20:02.801 --> 20:05.497

- If I win, we will go to a meeting. - OK.

22:11.797 --> 22:15.358
That would not be too much? Let atready, dinner, suite with jacuzzi.

22:15.534 --> 22:17.695
If you are lucky, taIvez has a show

22:17.836 --> 22:19.929
Magic WatzeI the old boudoir.

22:21.406 --> 22:23.966
What, you spent all night thinking about it?

22:24.309 --> 22:25.711
Scrotum.

22:25.711 --> 22:28.646
Actually, yeah, I kind of passed.

22:30.515 --> 22:32.642
Let atready will tell me

22:32.751 --> 22:35.584
You are preserving for the right guy?

22:35.721 --> 22:37.245
This can not be possibIe.

22:37.356 --> 22:42.293
When you're proving with this outfit.

22:42.527 --> 22:45.325
What I escoIho wear is what is confortáveI for me.

22:45.397 --> 22:47.865
Why do not you use a little more Aigo confortáveI?

22:47.933 --> 22:50.663
As a coma?

22:53.839 --> 22:55.033
Screw U!

23:00.579 --> 23:03.275
- How's the famiIy Ron? - Oh, they are fine.

23:04.483 --> 23:08.249
It 'is already walking and faIando. I can not believe May.

23:08.954 --> 23:11.718
I mean, we get to spend the holidays together, but ...

23:11.923 --> 23:13.754
It is never enough.

23:13.892 --> 23:15.587
I always feel as if I were not to atready eies.

23:16.461 --> 23:18.190
When the Hate birthday?

23:18.263 --> 23:19.787
In six months.

23:19.865 --> 23:21.666
I have one too.

23:21.666 --> 23:23.531
HeIicóptero toy.

23:23.769 --> 23:24.870
I do not know what to make IEE.

23:24.870 --> 23:26.838
Well, I'm sure IEE will love.

23:27.472 --> 23:30.635
And it will be finished after this, then you will be atready to give IEE.

23:30.742 --> 23:31.834
Hope so.

23:32.878 --> 23:34.311
Me too.

23:35.380 --> 23:37.280
Hey, can I use it a little bit?

23:37.449 --> 23:39.508
Yeah, I'm done for today.

23:41.286 --> 23:43.311
Be careful with these two losers.

23:43.688 --> 23:46.782
- What the fuck? - Dude, IEE is an idiot.

23:46.892 --> 23:49.952
You know, sometimes I think you and I are the only normal, AIEM captain.

23:50.061 --> 23:52.791
If I agreed with that, we'd both be wrong.

23:52.964 --> 23:54.955
In my opinion, IEE is just as bad.

23:55.066 --> 23:58.365
How the hell you Ievanta this thing, man?

24:01.440 --> 24:03.738
- Hey, Ron. - What was Roy?

24:03.842 --> 24:06.675
You have about 45 minutes, and then we will have a speciaI meeting.

24:07.212 --> 24:08.975
We just voItar the Iast mission.

24:09.981 --> 24:12.882
- Roy, I want to see my son! - Ron, reIaxe!

24:13.251 --> 24:15.310
Let's taIk about it after the meeting, okay?

24:17.789 --> 24:19.780
I do not know, I do not understand.

24:19.925 --> 24:23.862
I'm a perfectly saudáveI man soIteiro young.

24:23.862 --> 24:29.630
It 'has that little body tight. I'd like to pick and eIa

24:29.868 --> 24:31.961
Take-coIocá within my Boise.

24:32.504 --> 24:35.530
You know, sort of the way ... Do you keep your girlfriend pIástico

24:35.707 --> 24:37.572
we all know.

24:37.742 --> 24:41.269
- it is rubber. - Realize that I'm still here, right?

24:41.379 --> 24:42.681
Well, what is the probIem Cassie?

24:42.681 --> 24:46.515
We are not poetic enough for your romantic needs?

24:47.252 --> 24:49.948
I mean, we went, I used the term boudoir.

24:50.021 --> 24:53.513
And that's kind of romantic term ...

24:53.792 --> 24:57.922
aIemão in garden or beer. Aigo or so.

24:58.029 --> 25:00.930
Or is French. To Roia.

25:01.399 --> 25:02.525
Oh, come on.

25:03.735 --> 25:05.726
Seriously, you have to admit.

25:06.238 --> 25:08.832
Right here? Love at first sight.

25:10.242 --> 25:11.402
Wants to know?

25:11.476 --> 25:15.674
You're right, I should stop simpIesmente Iutar with my impuIsos.

25:15.881 --> 25:18.281
I wanted you from the moment I set oIhos you.

25:18.350 --> 25:20.018
The oIhos do not lie.

25:20.018 --> 25:21.679
Tonight...

25:25.323 --> 25:26.654
Oh really?

25:26.958 --> 25:28.755
Do not.

25:30.595 --> 25:31.830
Oh, my face!

25:31.830 --> 25:34.924
- You should have expected. - it is fire.

25:54.486 --> 25:55.748
AIFA squad.

25:56.021 --> 25:58.251
You have a meeting in 40 minutes, are atready.

25:58.423 --> 26:00.823
What is another rescue mission?

26:00.892 --> 26:03.228
The Somebody cat stuck in a tree?

26:03.228 --> 26:04.695
Where's the rest of your team?

26:04.763 --> 26:06.526
You told me I just separated.

26:06.598 --> 26:07.656
Be atready.

26:09.434 --> 26:12.637
So wait a minute, if I go up aqueIa tree,

26:12.637 --> 26:15.231
this counts as if I'll have reaImente aIgum ...

26:35.827 --> 26:37.522
You need to taIk me sir?

26:37.629 --> 26:38.789
His squad has a meeting

26:38.930 --> 26:41.364
in 20 minutes, to be sure Ia.

26:42.233 --> 26:43.791
For that, one more mission?

26:43.902 --> 26:46.632
I do not have to Iiberdade divuIgar it, you know.

26:46.805 --> 26:48.898
We should not go to the other.

26:50.775 --> 26:52.970
All right, I'll be atready.

27:05.290 --> 27:08.418
I hope you have rested since the Iast mission.

27:08.793 --> 27:10.362
I know you're all tired and want ?? reIaxar,

27:10.362 --> 27:11.730
let me tranquiIizá-Ios now

27:11.730 --> 27:14.392
You still will not start this mission by aIguns days.

27:15.200 --> 27:17.669
That said, it should be quite a task fáciI

27:17.669 --> 27:19.637
aIgumas compared to their other duties.

27:20.005 --> 27:23.839
With all due respect, we were promised two months of Iicença.

27:23.942 --> 27:25.409
Things change.

27:25.543 --> 27:27.534
The situation has recently been brought to our attention.

27:27.612 --> 27:29.671
Then assign the Bravo Squadron or lies down.

27:29.748 --> 27:31.579
Use a larger squad than their own

27:31.683 --> 27:33.173
It would be a waste of our resources and manpower.

27:33.284 --> 27:36.515
- Let atready, as if that's what you ... - Keith, that's enough!

27:36.988 --> 27:39.320
I Ciaro I did not want faItar with respect.

27:39.391 --> 27:40.792
It's my first time with trabaIhando aIguns of you,

27:40.792 --> 27:42.594
so I'll start with a basic introduction.

27:42.594 --> 27:45.256
My name is Rick DaIIas, I will be your aide in this assignment.

27:45.463 --> 27:46.862
This is a small summary to inform Ios

27:46.998 --> 27:49.660
of detaIhes about the next mission.

27:50.502 --> 27:52.936
Leave this base in two days. Your mission begins in four.

27:53.772 --> 27:55.831
This answers all questions.

27:55.940 --> 27:57.475
FinaI in this interview, you will have all

27:57.475 --> 27:59.310
the information we have about the mission.

27:59.310 --> 28:01.801
the trabaIho of you is to figure out the rest.

28:04.649 --> 28:06.514
Quite simpIes, my ass.

28:06.618 --> 28:09.246
If it were as simpIes, so why do we?

28:09.421 --> 28:10.718
We are professionals.

28:10.822 --> 28:13.391
EspeciaImente after all aqueIa shit to save resources

28:13.391 --> 28:15.359
and pessoai that IEE was faIando.

28:15.827 --> 28:17.562
unexpected DesenvoIvimentos.

28:17.562 --> 28:19.427
Let's captain, which could

28:19.564 --> 28:20.999
be desenvoIvido that would extend to us?

28:20.999 --> 28:23.433
We 's got you reason, we are always sent as ghosts,

28:23.501 --> 28:26.197
missions that no one should know because we were atready.

28:26.337 --> 28:28.828
So I think now the question is, what eies hiding?

28:28.907 --> 28:31.876
TaIvez the big question is, why the hell were not you at the meeting?

28:32.010 --> 28:35.741
You are very caring. We have our orders, it is what it is.

28:35.847 --> 28:37.747
Like a good captain.

28:37.816 --> 28:42.378
You have your orders, with orders well, and you can not even think about it.

28:43.488 --> 28:46.651
Wants to know? TaIvez I've never been in níveI their position.

28:46.758 --> 28:48.326
You need aIguns days foIga,

28:48.326 --> 28:50.260
all of you, get out and divertam a bit.

28:50.361 --> 28:52.964
- will not join us? - No, I have a lot to do,

28:52.964 --> 28:55.626
- even before the mission begins. - You always have to make Aigo.

28:55.734 --> 28:57.326
You lost, man.

28:59.704 --> 29:02.366
- See you later, Captain. - Hey, Cassie?

29:03.441 --> 29:04.931
Are you alright?

29:05.310 --> 29:07.879
I think a visit would not be bad idea.

29:07.879 --> 29:09.180
No, it would not.

29:09.180 --> 29:11.148
'ProvaveImente feel Faïta me too.

29:12.283 --> 29:15.810
Yo, bitch! Hurry up!

29:17.422 --> 29:18.889
See you later.

29:24.763 --> 29:26.765
I think we should go out drinking.

29:26.765 --> 29:28.967
Yes, exactly what we need, Keith drunk.

29:28.967 --> 29:31.369
You act as if I were drinking and getting into a fight or so Aigo.

29:31.369 --> 29:33.599
I think it sounds like fun, let's have fun.

29:33.838 --> 29:36.830
- Since when do you enjoy parties? - Always enjoyed parties.

29:36.941 --> 29:38.670
You just are not the type of people who usually go to parties together.

29:38.810 --> 29:40.869
I think you've learned.

29:40.945 --> 29:42.936
- Hey, you know ... - Yes, I know, screw you.

29:43.248 --> 29:44.613
Exactly, I do not even have to say.

29:44.682 --> 29:47.173
We can not go this way, we will change us.

29:47.285 --> 29:50.277
- I think we should change us. - Let's go then.

29:51.656 --> 29:52.645
I am fine.

29:52.724 --> 29:54.025
No, I think you should change too.

29:54.025 --> 29:55.959
- No, I'm fine. - You seem terríveI.

29:56.027 --> 29:57.619
- You should be ashamed - It's slimming

30:07.772 --> 30:09.740
- Oh, you brought me two? - Yes.

30:09.841 --> 30:10.967
Does this mean aIguxsma thing?

30:11.042 --> 30:13.408
That means it is two to one, baby.

30:20.285 --> 30:21.877
Okay, so how tight?

30:21.953 --> 30:24.751
The tighter shirt this man has.

30:24.823 --> 30:26.415
I'm not lying!

30:26.491 --> 30:28.288
The tighter shirt that has IEE.

30:31.262 --> 30:32.593
Ladies, where are you going?

30:32.664 --> 30:34.359
She 'like me.

30:34.432 --> 30:35.729
Oh yes, you saying.

30:35.800 --> 30:37.358
What, what's so funny here?

30:37.468 --> 30:40.335
Oh, we're just having fun, and you are the attraction principai.

30:40.405 --> 30:43.508
This is geraImente the case, but what's so funny now?

30:43.508 --> 30:46.377
Oh Scott here was promising us that you would be wearing

30:46.377 --> 30:48.345
tighter shirt you have.

30:49.747 --> 30:52.944
Well if you have, bears, some Cass?

30:53.017 --> 30:55.815
Do you like it? You are not faIando me?

30:55.920 --> 30:57.945
And Hoover, what the hell is going IIA?

30:58.022 --> 30:59.785
I do not know anything.

31:00.258 --> 31:03.887
Yes, in case you're wondering, eies are all yours.

31:04.229 --> 31:05.423
InfeIizmente, sim.

31:06.364 --> 31:08.264
In fact, I do not feel so well.

31:08.366 --> 31:10.501
I think Somebody might need a ride.

31:10.501 --> 31:11.803
I will not be me.

31:11.803 --> 31:13.634
OIhe not for me.

31:13.705 --> 31:15.607
- Ieva I-Io. - And then,

31:15.607 --> 31:18.201
Better Ieva-Io before IEE begin to confess all their sins.

31:18.276 --> 31:20.244
Hey, I know how much I can take it.

31:20.311 --> 31:23.212
- Yes, and how many would be? - I do not know.

31:25.650 --> 31:26.810
I take like ...

31:27.585 --> 31:30.021
Four, six on a good day.

31:30.021 --> 31:31.784
- I only had two. - Okay, try seven.

31:31.990 --> 31:34.015
Ei, eu sou um bebedor taIentoso.

31:34.259 --> 31:37.717
- Isso é taIento? - Puro taIento.

31:37.829 --> 31:39.456
Everyone has to be good at aIguma thing.

31:39.530 --> 31:42.590
But faIando seriously if you will Ievar me home, we should leave now.

31:44.502 --> 31:45.662
Diverta itself.

Yeah, you too Cassie.

31:50.742 --> 31:52.443

No hug? See you.

31:54.512 --> 31:55.444

Here it is.

32:35.453 --> 32:37.478
Thank you.

32:39.724 --> 32:41.658
If you say, man.

32:41.793 --> 32:45.697

32:45.697 --> 32:47.332
Day after day, you know?

32:47.332 --> 32:48.924
What, you have 60 years?

32:49.834 --> 32:51.825

32:54.405 --> 32:56.600
So how are jiii and Junior?

'Just sent me a letter with

33:01.746 --> 33:04.415
a photo with a hate loneliness toy.

33:04.415 --> 33:06.815
- That's IegaI! - No, it's actually not IegaI.

33:07.785 --> 33:10.355
I do not want IEE follow my steps.

33:10.355 --> 33:12.516
I mean, oIhe for me. And not Ieve me

33:12.657 --> 33:13.885
Mai, I like you and everything.

33:13.992 --> 33:15.289
But...

33:16.894 --> 33:19.192
I'd rather spend time with my famiIy.

33:20.365 --> 33:21.491
Is that you?

33:21.566 --> 33:25.559
Well, let's just say I have not found 'the escoIhida' 'yet.

33:25.837 --> 33:28.237
Yeah, well you're a bit stupid.

33:28.306 --> 33:29.568
Quai is, you have to admit.

33:30.975 --> 33:34.308
I would have to say that, at first glance,

33:34.412 --> 33:37.615
I am the most handsome guy in this bar.

33:37.615 --> 33:39.606
- Okay. - So you are saying this ...

33:40.752 --> 33:43.812
You escoIhe a girl. Any extra girl in this bar.

49:59.396 --> 50:01.698
- I need my coIírio. - What?

50:01.698 --> 50:03.290
Grandma, it's me.

50:03.367 --> 50:05.335
You are so Beautiful.

50:06.703 --> 50:09.831
You make me Iembrar my granddaughter.

50:10.907 --> 50:13.307
It 'was so sweet.

50:14.745 --> 50:16.736
Are you OK, darling?

50:18.982 --> 50:21.212
It's okay, honey.

50:22.619 --> 50:25.918
- It's all right. - It's all right.

50:27.290 --> 50:28.518
Sim.

50:34.331 --> 50:35.699
- Hey. - What's up?

50:35.699 --> 50:36.566
Nothing, descuIpe,

50:36.566 --> 50:38.761
- here a long time? - AIguns minutes no matter.

50:38.835 --> 50:40.962
- Did you see her? - Yes.

50:41.038 --> 50:43.302
- It's all right? - Yes.

50:44.975 --> 50:46.465
You are lying to me.

50:49.279 --> 50:51.372
This AIzheimer tem.

51:09.299 --> 51:11.733
June 14, 2013.

51:12.836 --> 51:15.396
new and interesting AIguns desenvoIvimentos.

51:16.840 --> 51:21.511
40C-3 experiment has shown aIgumas ...

51:21.511 --> 51:24.742
unusual mutations compared to the other four.

51:27.517 --> 51:29.719
The cell structure of the skin

51:29.719 --> 51:32.711
He began to solidify about seven hours.

51:33.857 --> 51:35.882
The body began to solidify

51:35.959 --> 51:38.894
not long after that the process of decay began.

51:40.464 --> 51:43.399
I estimate that within a few days,

51:43.467 --> 51:45.867
whole body will solidify.

51:48.939 --> 51:51.737
The oIhar this thing is impIacáveI.

51:52.909 --> 51:54.706
But not inteIigência.

51:55.979 --> 51:58.413
He sees me as the enemy.

52:00.317 --> 52:04.413
AIgum human subconscious remains within DEIE.

52:06.389 --> 52:09.358
It 'is Iembra than I did with IEE.

52:16.032 --> 52:18.000
I face with hatred.

52:20.604 --> 52:23.801
I can see that IEE want to tear my throat!

52:24.808 --> 52:27.606
I play as aIimento to Akhaian Iado the abominations out.

52:43.293 --> 52:45.784
Only aIguns days for the show to begin.

53:05.515 --> 53:07.717
Hey, I wanted to ask you something.

53:07.717 --> 53:09.514
Why do not you wear a wedding aIiança finger?

53:09.586 --> 53:11.755
You two are married, right?

53:11.755 --> 53:13.623
It's my amuIeto of luck.

53:13.623 --> 53:14.988
Why the hell did you use in the neck?

53:15.225 --> 53:16.886
To keep Ia close to my heart.

53:16.960 --> 53:18.495
This is very gay!

53:18.495 --> 53:20.664
You can not be reaImente IegaI for more than a minute, is not it?

53:20.664 --> 53:21.698
Do not.

53:21.698 --> 53:24.258
So, Keith, you have Aigo to tell us? What happened last night?

53:24.334 --> 53:26.859
It ''s just aggravated because did not get anything last night.

53:26.970 --> 53:29.564
Or is it because the poIiciais were enxendo hate the bag.

53:29.639 --> 53:32.733
Engraçadão. You know, you should be a comedian.

53:36.746 --> 53:38.615
OIhe for these two!

53:38.615 --> 53:41.448
I bet you two had fun last night, huh?

53:42.419 --> 53:44.614
ProvaveImente more than you in prison.

53:45.956 --> 53:48.325
Hey, as everyone knows it?

53:48.325 --> 53:51.528
You do not know how to be discreet, Keith.

53:51.528 --> 53:53.730
Or how to keep your mouth shut.

53:53.730 --> 53:55.561
Or stop causing probIemas.

53:56.833 --> 53:59.324
Or how disappointed his team.

53:59.436 --> 54:01.199
This is more like IEE.

54:01.304 --> 54:03.397
Somebody has more good Aigo to add?

54:04.608 --> 54:05.939
Captain.

54:10.413 --> 54:12.415
Colonel, you wanted to see me?

54:12.415 --> 54:15.543
Captain on the mission that has been assigned,

54:15.619 --> 54:17.416
the meeting given to you and your team

54:17.487 --> 54:19.614
incIuiu not all disponíveI information.

54:19.789 --> 54:22.587
So you're saying I should not go on this mission.

54:22.659 --> 54:25.629
The nearby town has reIatado several people

54:25.629 --> 54:28.325
They disappeared to Iongo of úItimos months.

54:28.398 --> 54:31.834
- All IocaI near the goal. - heard taIk about all this at the meeting.

54:31.968 --> 54:36.564
They were also informed that it was a reconnaissance mission to gather information.

54:37.540 --> 54:38.734
It is not.

54:39.776 --> 54:41.676
We find photographic evidence.

54:41.778 --> 54:43.837
There are things that our unit inteIigência

54:43.947 --> 54:45.608
You can not expIicar about the area.

54:45.782 --> 54:49.019
The found documents show that the US government

54:49.019 --> 54:50.987
envoIvido is in the past.

54:52.255 --> 54:53.222
Our conseIheiro.

54:53.957 --> 54:55.219
Who is it?

54:55.325 --> 54:56.849
I trust Neie.

54:58.428 --> 55:00.521
But not in your unit.

55:02.599 --> 55:04.934
Please understand, this is not a joke.

55:04.934 --> 55:07.664
You and your team could be heading for a armadiIha.

55:07.804 --> 55:11.205
I'll take the risks, considering they are forced assumptions.

55:11.308 --> 55:12.876
Ah, EIAs are not forced.

55:12.876 --> 55:13.900
Father!

55:15.712 --> 55:17.407
Will be all right.

55:48.878 --> 55:50.675
Scott, assume the tip.

55:51.681 --> 55:53.615
Keith, assume the right fianco.

55:53.717 --> 55:55.785
Ron, take left fianco.

55:55.785 --> 55:57.946
Cassandra and I are going behind.

55:58.021 --> 55:59.352
Move it.

57:00.683 --> 57:02.378
We are visuaI contact.

57:04.554 --> 57:06.920
Ron, take point and look ahead.

57:07.924 --> 57:11.594
AIFA squad, go back 15 meters.

57:11.594 --> 57:13.425
All messing up.

57:21.304 --> 57:23.272
Alright, let's split up.

57:23.373 --> 57:24.670
I'm going behind.

57:24.741 --> 57:27.403
- It's not the back this time, Keith. - Oh my god, fall mouth.

57:27.477 --> 57:28.944
Focus, focus, focus.

57:29.012 --> 57:30.445
Move it.

59:17.520 --> 59:19.818
Hey, what did you think?

59:46.416 --> 59:47.974
Somebody is experimenting,

59:49.218 --> 59:50.853
these are all the tests resuItados

59:50.853 --> 59:54.254
who were executed in dogs, rats, call it what you want.

59:55.325 --> 59:56.690
Even humans.

59:58.494 --> 01:00:01.429
Aigo very big is going to happen and it seems we just can not yet.

01:00:02.865 --> 01:00:05.595
So where is everyone?

01:00:05.702 --> 01:00:08.466
That's right, it makes no sense, there's no name here.

01:00:08.771 --> 01:00:11.797
Only Ietras and numbers of all the different experiments.

01:00:11.874 --> 01:00:12.932
That's it.

01:00:58.388 --> 01:01:00.413
Movement, we move!

01:01:02.458 --> 01:01:04.756
- Quai is your situation? - Aivo Closing.

01:01:43.733 --> 01:01:45.462
No!

01:01:45.601 --> 01:01:47.569
This area is under miIitar investigation.

01:01:53.976 --> 01:01:55.637
Lie on the floor!

01:02:00.349 --> 01:02:01.873
De joeIhos!

01:02:59.308 --> 01:03:00.400
Ron!

01:03:29.338 --> 01:03:31.306
Let's go now!

01:03:31.374 --> 01:03:32.942
What the hell is going on?

01:03:32.942 --> 01:03:34.933
I've seen enough! Let's meet Scott and get out of here!

01:03:35.011 --> 01:03:37.046
Contact HQ, tell eies on aIteração the situation.

01:03:37.046 --> 01:03:39.514
AIFA to HQ, we find unknown hostile,

01:03:39.582 --> 01:03:40.981
soIicitando abortion of the mission.

01:03:42.285 --> 01:03:44.310
QG, answer!

01:03:44.387 --> 01:03:46.289
Radio inútiI.

01:03:46.289 --> 01:03:47.790
What are you waiting for?

01:03:47.790 --> 01:03:49.951
Hey, save your ammo, save your ammo, let's go!

01:03:50.026 --> 01:03:51.823
Yeah maIuco? We abort the mission.

01:03:51.894 --> 01:03:53.987
I saw an underground path, we must go atready.

01:03:54.063 --> 01:03:56.224
No, I'm the captain, I command that the mission ...

01:03:56.299 --> 01:03:58.460
OIha, I hate to interrupt, but we have to make a decision now!

01:03:58.534 --> 01:04:00.627
Do not you think if we can contain it here

01:04:00.736 --> 01:04:02.465
and now, it is not our duty to do this?

01:04:02.538 --> 01:04:04.207
I will not lose more men by Casusa it.

01:04:04.207 --> 01:04:06.505
- Ron died because of it. - And your famiIy?

01:04:09.779 --> 01:04:12.441
Scott, you go, take the tip.

01:04:13.716 --> 01:04:15.650
Cassie, cubra own.

01:04:17.420 --> 01:04:20.480
Okay in your hand. All of it.

01:04:33.369 --> 01:04:34.461
Book!

01:04:36.606 --> 01:04:38.403
- Book! - Book.

01:04:43.779 --> 01:04:48.910
Now that we have a minute Somebody can tell me what the hell were Akhaian things?

01:04:49.018 --> 01:04:50.920
They are experiments.

01:04:50.920 --> 01:04:53.354
Their bodies are deteriorating, as well as those who attacked us.

01:04:53.422 --> 01:04:55.754
- What kind of experiences? - Pharmaceutical.

01:04:55.825 --> 01:04:57.759
AqueIes five wealthy investors who disappeared?

01:04:57.894 --> 01:05:00.556
- ProvaveImente envoIvidos. - When you say pharmaceutical ...

01:05:01.397 --> 01:05:03.490
Are we faIando a new drug?

01:05:04.233 --> 01:05:06.802
According to these documents found, yes.

01:05:06.802 --> 01:05:09.405
In fact, a cure for enveIhecimento.

01:05:09.405 --> 01:05:12.306
oIha, it has not expIica Akhaian what things are.

01:05:12.408 --> 01:05:15.309
MeIhorias biochemical structure of a ceIuIar be organic,

01:05:15.444 --> 01:05:17.412
semeIhante to a super-human.

01:05:17.580 --> 01:05:18.911
This is a failed experiment.

01:05:19.882 --> 01:05:22.407
I do not care how advanced these beings are ...

01:05:22.551 --> 01:05:24.781
Kwando Eu Atiro, AES struggle.

01:05:24.887 --> 01:05:26.752
And then, they fall and die.

01:05:26.923 --> 01:05:30.222
So why the hell are these things do not fall?

01:05:30.293 --> 01:05:31.692
Everything is switched on.

01:05:31.794 --> 01:05:35.992
Disappearances in IocaI city aqueIes five rich guys, these things,

01:05:36.265 --> 01:05:37.823
- everything is switched on. - Right.

01:05:37.900 --> 01:05:41.666
Cassie and I, we oIhar ahead and you, cover the rear.

01:05:53.049 --> 01:05:55.449
- Book! - Book.

01:06:03.626 --> 01:06:04.888
Nothing yet.

01:06:04.994 --> 01:06:09.192
- This pIace seems to have been evacuated. - I think whoever was here, he is dead.

01:06:09.365 --> 01:06:11.731
Atready you think these things out Ievaram all here too?

01:06:12.001 --> 01:06:14.003
I did not see any body.

01:06:14.003 --> 01:06:15.766
TaIvez owned mudaram owned the Iugar?

01:06:15.838 --> 01:06:17.931
Eies did not respond to our weapons, not to our threats

01:06:18.207 --> 01:06:20.402
I doubt moved evidence.

01:06:21.711 --> 01:06:26.307
Okay, this is out of protocoIo, but I need you three go ahead.

01:06:26.582 --> 01:06:27.984
I will back our steps,

01:06:27.984 --> 01:06:30.817
sure that we are not walking into an ambush.

01:06:31.253 --> 01:06:32.652
All right, let's go.

01:06:58.614 --> 01:07:01.412
Hey, I think I found bodies here. It bodies.

01:07:03.719 --> 01:07:04.777
Cassie.

01:07:19.568 --> 01:07:23.368
I do not understand it, there is no maIdita AIMA in this pIace.

01:07:24.373 --> 01:07:25.808
And if an ambush?

01:07:25.808 --> 01:07:27.776
I'm beginning to think it may be.

01:07:30.846 --> 01:07:32.336
Who would ambush us?

01:07:34.383 --> 01:07:35.475
Do not shot!

01:07:36.919 --> 01:07:39.288
Please, I'm Iisonjeado.

01:07:39.288 --> 01:07:43.247
But I do not think three rifIes point for me is necessary.

01:07:43.359 --> 01:07:45.884
- I'm just a man. - Who are you?

01:07:47.363 --> 01:07:50.855
I believe it is polite to present before asking Somebody its name.

01:07:50.933 --> 01:07:53.561
Well, I would like to say Oia, coIocando a bay on the head Somebody!

01:07:53.702 --> 01:07:55.604
So I'll ask again IHE,

01:07:55.604 --> 01:07:57.834
who the hell are you?

01:07:57.907 --> 01:07:58.839
I understand.

01:08:00.009 --> 01:08:02.204
My name is Dr. NichoIas Bergman.

01:08:02.278 --> 01:08:04.246
Berg, like the mountains.

01:08:04.346 --> 01:08:08.442
- And you are the man behind it? - I am the grandfather of this IocaI.

01:08:08.751 --> 01:08:10.719
Everything you see belongs to me.

01:08:10.853 --> 01:08:13.287
You responsáveI Peios disappearances.

01:08:14.457 --> 01:08:16.254
AqueIes to wealthy investors?

01:08:16.325 --> 01:08:19.783
Everyone makes mistakes. These investors were mine.

01:08:20.261 --> 01:08:24.358
I needed money, and his government had stopped funding my research.

01:08:24.899 --> 01:08:27.630
This provaveImente expIica the attack on the base Peios government agents.

01:08:27.803 --> 01:08:29.939
Government agents?

01:08:29.939 --> 01:08:33.602
Oh, the fiIiaI men who funded my research.

01:08:33.975 --> 01:08:36.501
We can not have unwanted information circuIando.

01:08:36.612 --> 01:08:39.881
So you decided to use the city to run pessoai

01:08:39.881 --> 01:08:42.017
iIegaImente your experiments?

01:08:42.017 --> 01:08:44.679
Believe me, it was my úItimo feature.

01:08:44.920 --> 01:08:48.856
I used my own scientists before deciding the innocent envoIver.

01:08:49.558 --> 01:08:51.560
All eies died for a good cause.

01:08:51.560 --> 01:08:53.288
Motherfucker!

01:08:53.395 --> 01:08:55.658
The three of you have seen the documents, right?

01:08:55.731 --> 01:08:59.223
You understand that my research will change the world?

01:08:59.435 --> 01:09:02.926
A pharmaceutical drug for meIhorar the structure of the human body.

01:09:03.471 --> 01:09:06.532
It is much compIicado than that, my dear.

01:09:06.675 --> 01:09:09.837
I'm the scientist fiIho who found the fountain of youth.

01:09:10.212 --> 01:09:12.645
- I never heard that taIk. - Not even.

01:09:12.747 --> 01:09:14.408
It was all kept secret.

01:09:15.350 --> 01:09:18.319
During a second MundiaI War, um Iaboratório secret

01:09:18.319 --> 01:09:20.421
It was built under the Hitier orders.

01:09:20.421 --> 01:09:23.220
To create a cure for death itself.

01:09:24.292 --> 01:09:27.595
Hitier felt that once his secret was discovered race,

01:09:27.595 --> 01:09:30.531
EIE need a way to preserve Ia.

01:09:30.599 --> 01:09:31.867
It was chaos.

01:09:31.867 --> 01:09:34.461
And the experiments left the ControI.

01:09:34.537 --> 01:09:37.700
All instaIação had to be destroyed.

01:09:37.773 --> 01:09:40.832
But my father could saIvar aIgumas samples.

01:09:40.943 --> 01:09:44.640
I 'could not continue their research under the fallen AIemanha.

01:09:44.712 --> 01:09:46.544
So IEE came to the land of opportunity.

01:09:46.615 --> 01:09:49.379
You are lying! No way eies brought these samples

01:09:49.484 --> 01:09:51.817
without being discovered.

01:09:51.987 --> 01:09:54.182
Yes. That was a probIem.

01:09:54.290 --> 01:09:56.850
A probIem my father took the risk to put away.

01:09:56.959 --> 01:10:00.952
'Injected even Neie samples to bring Ias without suspicion.

01:10:01.330 --> 01:10:03.560
This sounds like bad science fiction to me.

01:10:04.533 --> 01:10:06.524
Samples injected himself EIE

01:10:06.635 --> 01:10:08.771
fIuem through my veins.

01:10:08.771 --> 01:10:11.831
- I'm 66 years old! - Lie!

01:10:11.907 --> 01:10:13.374
It is very possibIe.

01:10:13.475 --> 01:10:17.377
InfeIizmente, not everyone reacts the same way.

01:10:17.479 --> 01:10:20.915
The drug kills most guinea pigs before any meIhorias done.

01:10:21.016 --> 01:10:23.849
- That's what they were. - We find what we seek,

01:10:23.953 --> 01:10:27.650
- Let's get out of here and Io. - What are you whispering?

01:10:27.957 --> 01:10:30.983
Do not you think all this will end with me, right?

01:10:31.293 --> 01:10:32.385
What do you mean?

01:10:32.461 --> 01:10:35.225
FaIhas My experiences are a blessing to aIguns.

01:10:35.531 --> 01:10:38.523
I sold the drug to dealers worldwide.

01:10:38.701 --> 01:10:41.795
He did a great Iucro with it, but it's not enough.

01:10:42.004 --> 01:10:44.336
You sold these things to terrorists?

01:10:44.506 --> 01:10:46.406
MaIdito Burger, is atready Quai is his name.

01:10:46.475 --> 01:10:49.967
My research needs to be funded in one way or another.

01:10:50.279 --> 01:10:53.248
And since his government was not able to contribute,

01:10:53.315 --> 01:10:56.478
I decided to follow with my own hands.

01:10:58.387 --> 01:11:01.618
As the world's nations surrounded Hitier as an infection,

01:11:01.957 --> 01:11:05.586
This virus seIará your destination.

01:11:06.462 --> 01:11:08.760
Do not take another step!

01:11:08.831 --> 01:11:09.957
CavaIheiros.

01:11:12.801 --> 01:11:13.995
Contact, contact!

01:11:14.236 --> 01:11:15.726
On the right!

01:11:23.712 --> 01:11:25.737
Shoot!

01:14:33.502 --> 01:14:35.231
Pessoai, off we go!

01:15:10.272 --> 01:15:11.569
Stop it! Hands to Aito!

01:15:14.343 --> 01:15:15.970
I aconseIho you to lower your weapon.

01:15:16.245 --> 01:15:18.406
You are not in a position to give me orders.

01:15:18.847 --> 01:15:20.747
You kill me,

01:15:20.916 --> 01:15:24.419
there is no one to prevent a major outbreak.

01:15:24.419 --> 01:15:27.320
You will be responsáveI Péia death miIhares of miIhões!

01:15:27.389 --> 01:15:28.490
Kill you?

01:15:28.490 --> 01:15:31.220
I have more than one way to Ieva-Io live voIta.

01:15:31.293 --> 01:15:34.319
I do not think I was Ciaro about the importance of this research.

01:15:34.396 --> 01:15:36.365
His experience is a failure.

01:15:36.365 --> 01:15:37.992
Over, you do not understand?

01:15:38.267 --> 01:15:41.770
It is you who do not understand, Captain.

01:15:41.770 --> 01:15:44.739
This virus is very difíciI of controIar.

01:15:44.806 --> 01:15:46.467
Enough talking, Bergman!

01:15:46.542 --> 01:15:50.911
- You have five seconds to get down! - What you do not understand?

01:15:51.547 --> 01:15:53.208
You saw my trabaIho!

01:15:53.415 --> 01:15:55.440
You've seen the documents.

01:15:56.418 --> 01:15:59.819
This drug is a cure for all diseases.

01:16:00.956 --> 01:16:03.288
This is the future!

01:17:08.223 --> 01:17:09.451
Come on!

01:17:27.409 --> 01:17:28.876
Mother FiIho!

01:17:30.212 --> 01:17:31.679
The maIdito bit me.

01:17:36.518 --> 01:17:38.577
I'm burning.

01:17:38.654 --> 01:17:40.555
It is is espaIhando.

01:17:40.555 --> 01:17:41.852
Take your coIete!

01:18:08.483 --> 01:18:10.686
We do not have time.

01:18:10.686 --> 01:18:12.551
- Are you alright? - I am fine.

01:18:13.522 --> 01:18:15.490
Let's hope Captain are too.

01:18:16.458 --> 01:18:20.258
We have to find the captain, but Peio I found so far,

01:18:20.328 --> 01:18:21.727
beat on the head of those things ...

01:18:22.898 --> 01:18:24.889
ASIS seem not to voItam Ievantar.

01:18:26.902 --> 01:18:28.631
I have to take it.

01:18:32.607 --> 01:18:33.975
Okay, pessoai.

01:18:33.975 --> 01:18:35.602
We have to move.

01:18:44.453 --> 01:18:45.511
Scott.

01:18:46.855 --> 01:18:48.322
Just in case.

01:19:26.495 --> 01:19:27.826
Contact!

01:19:53.388 --> 01:19:54.650
Dr. Bergman.

01:19:55.857 --> 01:19:58.655
Yes, the virus reached the second category.

01:19:59.761 --> 01:20:01.922
I look forward to meeting Io pessoaImente.

01:20:03.298 --> 01:20:06.461
Together we will change the world.

01:21:14.469 --> 01:21:15.868
Oh shit.

01:22:08.990 --> 01:22:10.617
Hey imbeciI!

01:22:57.572 --> 01:22:58.800
Cassie.

01:23:04.980 --> 01:23:06.971
Cassie.

01:23:16.224 --> 01:23:17.691
Cassie!

01:28:38.546 --> 01:28:39.877
Damn it!

01:31:54.342 --> 01:31:55.366
Sr. Hoover?

01:31:56.077 --> 01:31:58.375
Your fiIho voItou home.

01:31:58.479 --> 01:32:00.879
But Iamento inform Io that IEE is in critical condition.

01:32:04.652 --> 01:32:06.313
Mas own está vivo?

01:32:25.473 --> 01:32:27.675
You vioIou our security, managed infiItrar

01:32:27.675 --> 01:32:29.643
one of its in our base.

01:32:30.444 --> 01:32:32.275
Convinced one of our betray us.

01:32:32.380 --> 01:32:34.541
It seems that is a probIem of pessoai.

01:32:35.983 --> 01:32:38.586
You know, when the survivors of the AIFA Squadron

01:32:38.586 --> 01:32:41.350
They informed us about what happened during the mission,

01:32:41.422 --> 01:32:42.957
I did not believe neIes.

01:32:42.957 --> 01:32:44.892
Five days ago, watching the complimentary newspapers, aIguma shit about

01:32:44.892 --> 01:32:46.860
people eating each other in the streets.

01:32:48.796 --> 01:32:54.564
The resuItou aggression in poIícia shooting aIguns of descontroIados individuals.

01:32:54.902 --> 01:32:56.699
But they kept walking.

01:32:58.005 --> 01:32:59.632
So I started to believe.

01:33:00.908 --> 01:33:02.307
And now we have you,

01:33:02.476 --> 01:33:04.842
sitting, and secure Ionge it all.

01:33:06.013 --> 01:33:07.982
MiIhares of innocent people who die every minute.

01:33:07.982 --> 01:33:09.176
MuIheres children.

01:33:09.283 --> 01:33:10.580
Oh my God, oh my God.

01:33:11.485 --> 01:33:13.544
You'll be fine, okay? I'll just coIocar this gauze on ...

01:33:13.654 --> 01:33:15.519
Love, I need you to move your hands, love?

01:33:15.723 --> 01:33:18.225
AIice! AIice, wake up, Mommy's here!

01:33:18.225 --> 01:33:20.955
Come on, wake up. -Wake up now.

01:33:21.028 --> 01:33:23.223
Wake up love.

01:33:25.600 --> 01:33:27.431
Come on, we have to Ievantar.

01:33:31.706 --> 01:33:34.402
We'll be fine, my love.

01:33:35.476 --> 01:33:36.807
We'll be fine.

01:33:42.917 --> 01:33:44.418
So where do you want to go?

01:33:44.418 --> 01:33:47.388
AIFA squad did not find traces of NichoIas Bergman.

01:33:47.388 --> 01:33:49.857
Somebody need cuIpar by this disaster.

01:33:49.857 --> 01:33:52.951
Somebody wants you to cuIpar? CuIpe his superiors.

01:33:53.361 --> 01:33:55.659
This was predicted long ago.

01:33:55.863 --> 01:33:58.265
If this continues, we could be oIhando to an outbreak nacionaI

01:33:58.265 --> 01:33:59.900
the next 72 hours.

01:33:59.900 --> 01:34:01.925
His prophecy predicted this?

01:34:14.315 --> 01:34:15.475
You hear that?

01:34:16.751 --> 01:34:18.776
The screams, the agony?

01:34:20.354 --> 01:34:22.948
I could Ieva-Io here now and well let Io in the midst of chaos.

01:34:23.257 --> 01:34:25.657
My team would get resuItados meIhores than you.

01:34:27.395 --> 01:34:29.363
Sentadinho is there.

01:34:29.363 --> 01:34:31.456
Somebody else wants to taIk to you.

01:34:45.379 --> 01:34:47.381
Remember me?

01:34:47.381 --> 01:34:49.576
I helped you to shoot one of his companions.

01:34:52.319 --> 01:34:53.911
You infiItrou at our base.

01:34:56.857 --> 01:34:58.916
InfiItrou you as one of us.

01:35:02.630 --> 01:35:05.565
I'll make IHE aIgumas very simpIes questions.

01:35:07.268 --> 01:35:10.237
And you answered each deIas.

01:35:13.974 --> 01:35:17.569
How can we prevent an outbreak gIobaI?

01:35:20.681 --> 01:35:22.774
For whom Bergman is trabaIhando?

01:35:26.320 --> 01:35:28.880
You are trabaIhando to NichoIas Bergman?

01:35:33.027 --> 01:35:35.393
Answer my questions maIditas!

01:35:39.400 --> 01:35:40.367
Sim.

01:35:42.670 --> 01:35:45.400
Okay, you're not intimidated by it all, right?

01:35:47.041 --> 01:35:49.373
And that's why I'm going to bring you with me.

01:35:50.778 --> 01:35:52.507
And where would it be?

01:35:52.613 --> 01:35:54.513
Vamos voItar para o Iaboratório de Bergman.

01:35:59.854 --> 01:36:01.913
You will not find anything atready.

01:36:28.749 --> 01:36:30.842
Doutor NichoIas Bergman.

01:36:30.918 --> 01:36:33.887
It's good finaImente know the genius behind all this.

01:36:38.325 --> 01:36:41.488
I certainly hope you have kept your part of the bargain.

01:36:41.929 --> 01:36:43.829
I am a man paIavra.

01:36:43.931 --> 01:36:47.697
You will take your money, along with the five experiments sent.

01:36:47.768 --> 01:36:49.258
I'm impressed.

01:36:50.337 --> 01:36:52.737
Oh, and I certainly hope that miIitares have not been a

01:36:52.840 --> 01:36:54.000
interference for you.

01:36:54.241 --> 01:36:57.438
You have your pIans, I had mine.

01:36:57.511 --> 01:37:00.447
I assure IHE, which worked very well.

01:37:00.447 --> 01:37:01.539
I bet, yes.

01:37:02.950 --> 01:37:04.611
What next?

01:37:04.919 --> 01:37:05.908
Now?

01:37:08.422 --> 01:37:10.720
The world will fall into chaos.

01:37:10.925 --> 01:37:13.917
Governments enter into coIapso, and people will shout for help.

01:37:14.595 --> 01:37:17.291
E vamos dar a held.

01:37:18.499 --> 01:37:20.601
Dr. Bergman.

01:37:20.601 --> 01:37:23.470
Welcome to IIIuminati.

01:37:23.470 --> 01:37:27.167
We believe that peace is at hand.

01:40:37.431 --> 01:40:39.228
So you are lies, huh?

01:40:40.000 --> 01:40:42.298
I thought there were more of you that way.

01:40:42.503 --> 01:40:44.437
It is to fáciI eies cling.

01:40:45.372 --> 01:40:46.862
As for the rest of our team ...

01:40:48.542 --> 01:40:50.442
Eight morrerm under OFFICIAL Command.

01:40:51.945 --> 01:40:55.904
While I'm breathing, no one else will die.

01:40:59.553 --> 01:41:00.850
And to Bravo?

01:41:02.423 --> 01:41:05.824
The entire squadron was sent in 44 hours to coIocar area quarantined.

01:41:08.796 --> 01:41:11.632
Last night, it was just me and Parsons.

01:41:11.632 --> 01:41:13.759
Until IEE tried to take a chunk out of my neck.

01:41:14.835 --> 01:41:16.462
Since then, it's just ...

01:41:17.604 --> 01:41:20.368
I hoped you found me before turning a zombie.

01:41:21.275 --> 01:41:22.742
Tá a Ioucura atready out.

01:41:23.677 --> 01:41:26.510
What I think we need to do is regroup.

01:41:26.580 --> 01:41:27.604
People!

01:41:30.451 --> 01:41:33.284
Drop your weapon, or we will open fire.

01:41:35.589 --> 01:41:36.886
SoIte a gun ...

01:41:38.759 --> 01:41:41.387
- What was aquiIo? - This thing was not human.

01:41:41.528 --> 01:41:44.264
- How can you be sure? - Need to keep soIdiers in iinha.

01:41:44.264 --> 01:41:46.366
SoIdiers, really? You've oIhou around?

01:41:46.366 --> 01:41:49.233
You are still training, start acting this way!
